WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:02.043
What about this one?

00:02.220 --> 00:03.412
It's kind a bad ass, right?

00:05.580 --> 00:07.780
Just seems kind of crazy in the way I
****

00:08.292 --> 00:09.172
I don't know...

00:09.396 --> 00:12.803
That's not yours.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.612
*****

00:15.836 --> 00:18.812
and didn't seem to realize that
wasn't his hot coffee,

00:19.357 --> 00:21.188
so the question has to be asked...

00:21.660 --> 00:24.347
Is there no limit to
what he won't notice?

00:25.564 --> 00:27.988
What's a seven letter word
for ***

00:28.779 --> 00:31.971
- ***
- No, starts with an H.

00:32.006 --> 00:34.103
Handbag.

00:34.155 --> 00:36.122
Hmm, thank you.

00:36.207 --> 00:37.607
Okay.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.754 --> 00:51.638
All right, everybody.
Take a seat.

00:51.722 --> 00:54.974
As you may have heard,
our branch on the planet Jupiter

00:55.059 --> 00:57.560
Is up 8,000% in sales.

01:02.066 --> 01:04.300
Hold up.
That clock is slow.

01:04.352 --> 01:06.036
It is 5:00.

01:06.103 --> 01:08.705
I will see you all tomorrow.

01:08.773 --> 01:10.140
Bye, Stanley.
Love you.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.361
So long, Stanley.

01:14.445 --> 01:16.863
Good night, everybody.

01:32.865 --> 01:37.587
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

01:42.473 --> 01:43.606
So what kind of statement

01:43.674 --> 01:45.608
Are you making with
that costume, Kevin?

01:45.676 --> 01:47.560
Well, the statement
that I'm making, Oscar,

01:47.645 --> 01:50.196
Is I kind of look
like Michael Moore.

01:51.565 --> 01:53.450
- Dunder-Mifflin,
the is Erin.

01:53.517 --> 01:54.534
Happy Halloween.

01:54.618 --> 01:56.152
How can I haunt you today?

01:56.203 --> 01:57.187
A lot of people are really

01:57.254 --> 01:58.521
Getting into Halloween
this year.

01:58.589 --> 02:00.039
Six seconds, MacGruber!

02:00.124 --> 02:02.692
Pam's got a lot of fun stuff
planned...

02:02.743 --> 02:04.461
two seconds, MacGruber!

02:04.528 --> 02:07.530
Including a costume contest
and bobbing for apples

02:07.598 --> 02:08.715
And a Ouija board.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.534
Oh, boom!
Ohh, explosion!

02:11.585 --> 02:13.586
MacGruber!

02:13.671 --> 02:16.406
People are really into
the costume contest this year.

02:16.474 --> 02:18.341
Might have something
to do with the prize.

02:18.409 --> 02:20.009
Maybe you've heard of it.

02:20.060 --> 02:22.562
The 2011 Scranton/Wilkes-barre
coupon book,

02:22.646 --> 02:26.049
Worth over $15,000 in savings.

02:27.518 --> 02:28.451
Stop.

02:28.519 --> 02:29.552
Too late.

02:29.603 --> 02:30.720
If I was the real
Scranton strangler,

02:30.771 --> 02:33.156
You'd be so strangled by now.

02:33.224 --> 02:34.607
And if you're out there,
strangler,

02:34.692 --> 02:35.742
You will get caught.

02:35.826 --> 02:37.610
By me.

02:37.695 --> 02:39.379
Sounds like someone's
really trying to convince us

02:39.447 --> 02:40.897
That he's not
the Scranton strangler.

02:40.948 --> 02:42.999
To my chickens,
I'm the Scranton strangler.

02:44.168 --> 02:46.736
Oh-ho.
That's very funny.

02:46.787 --> 02:48.571
Looks like someone
decided to dress up

02:48.622 --> 02:49.672
As ol' Dwight Schrute's mom.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.307
- What?
- You're only 1/3 as beautiful

02:51.375 --> 02:53.309
And about half her height.

02:53.377 --> 02:54.778
I am supposed to be olive oil.

02:54.845 --> 02:57.213
And it makes more sense when
I'm standing next to Popeye,

02:57.281 --> 03:00.266
But Jim doesn't want
to put his costume on.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.135
I am Popeye.

03:02.219 --> 03:04.954
I've never really been
a costume guy.

03:05.022 --> 03:06.589
Even when I was a kid,
it just felt like something

03:06.657 --> 03:08.942
I was too old for, heh.

03:09.026 --> 03:09.993
And then, this morning,

03:10.060 --> 03:13.763
Pam hands me
this little number.

03:13.831 --> 03:15.114
No.

03:15.199 --> 03:18.368
- In case you can't read
my-my-my poker face...

03:19.837 --> 03:23.122
We will be reviewing
our sales policies.

03:23.207 --> 03:25.141
I have ten seconds
to explain them

03:25.209 --> 03:26.476
Or this whole place blows up.

03:26.544 --> 03:28.878
MacGruber!

03:28.946 --> 03:30.997
Lame.

03:31.081 --> 03:32.448
Why don't witches wear panties?

03:32.516 --> 03:33.783
Oh, here we go.

03:33.851 --> 03:35.952
Because they need
to grip the broom.

03:37.321 --> 03:40.139
- Oh! Who likes to water-ski
on Lake Erie?

03:40.224 --> 03:41.858
No, what...

03:41.926 --> 03:43.142
Where does Dracula
like to water ski?

03:43.227 --> 03:44.344
Lake Erie.

03:44.428 --> 03:46.346
When our warehouse workers
make deliveries,

03:46.430 --> 03:47.814
They're gonna be
encouraged to offer clients

03:47.882 --> 03:49.199
Extra products.

03:49.266 --> 03:51.501
And then they will split
those commissions with sales.

03:51.569 --> 03:53.469
Wait, so drivers are gonna
be able to sell paper

03:53.537 --> 03:55.305
On the road?
That is correct.

03:55.372 --> 03:57.540
- Has anyone started
calling you Gabe-wad yet?

03:57.608 --> 03:58.658
Not here, no.

03:58.742 --> 04:00.493
- Gabe-wad.

04:00.578 --> 04:02.529
Okay, guys, fun is fun, but...

04:04.915 --> 04:05.949
Blacula.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.116
Dracula.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.002
Oh, so...

04:09.086 --> 04:10.086
I almost forgot.

04:10.154 --> 04:11.554
You'll find this hilarious.

04:11.622 --> 04:14.591
Apparently, corporate
is going to have

04:14.658 --> 04:18.428
Drivers sell paper
on their routes now.

04:18.495 --> 04:21.346
That's like exactly sort of
the idea that you had.

04:21.432 --> 04:25.368
Yes, I do remember saying
something like that to you.

04:25.436 --> 04:28.021
Yeah.

04:28.105 --> 04:29.522
I'm sorry.

04:29.607 --> 04:30.773
I blew this.

04:30.841 --> 04:32.408
You should have gotten
credit for that, man.

04:32.476 --> 04:33.877
I'm just glad we're
gonna try it out.

04:33.944 --> 04:34.978
Really? We're good?

04:35.045 --> 04:35.979
We're cool.

04:36.046 --> 04:37.697
Okay.

04:37.781 --> 04:39.532
Okay.
What's that in your shirt?

04:39.617 --> 04:42.869
Oh, that's a ream of paper.

04:42.953 --> 04:44.320
Thought you might hit me.

04:44.371 --> 04:48.224
Darryl Philbin
is the greatest guy

04:48.292 --> 04:49.492
In the world.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.660
And you know what I'd like?

04:50.711 --> 04:53.663
I would like to have
all the racists

04:53.731 --> 04:54.864
Brought together

04:54.932 --> 04:57.867
And take Darryl Philbin
out to lunch.

04:57.935 --> 04:59.602
Just to see
what they're missing.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.070
It's a great stick, right?

05:01.138 --> 05:02.639
It's really good.
Classic.

05:02.706 --> 05:04.757
I feel like you might
win the whole thing with that.

05:04.842 --> 05:05.875
Thanks.

05:05.926 --> 05:07.510
Everyone realizes
this coupon book

05:07.578 --> 05:10.613
Is not actually worth
$15,000, right?

05:10.681 --> 05:13.116
You'd have to spend $200,000
on crap you don't even need

05:13.183 --> 05:15.018
To get $15,000 worth
of benefits.

05:15.085 --> 05:16.736
Heh, I'm not the only one
who sees this, right?

05:16.820 --> 05:17.820
No.

05:17.888 --> 05:19.188
- No, it...
- no.

05:19.239 --> 05:20.573
I get that.
I get that.

05:20.658 --> 05:22.224
Um, excuse me, everyone.

05:22.276 --> 05:24.661
I want to invite you all
to the Halloween party

05:24.728 --> 05:25.762
I'm having at my bar.

05:25.829 --> 05:27.196
You own a bar?

05:27.264 --> 05:29.332
Public school at exit 11?

05:29.400 --> 05:32.869
That's a great...Name.

05:32.937 --> 05:34.236
You're hilarious.

05:34.288 --> 05:35.338
A-plus.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.707
So...You're all
on the list.

05:37.758 --> 05:40.043
- Hey, man, can I get
a plus-five?

05:40.094 --> 05:41.127
It's all guys.

05:41.211 --> 05:42.845
Hey, what's the crowd
like, Danny?

05:42.913 --> 05:43.930
Our age?

05:44.014 --> 05:45.648
Okay.

05:45.716 --> 05:48.084
I don't
think that she would leave Jim

05:48.152 --> 05:49.302
For Danny.

05:49.386 --> 05:50.920
I don't know.
They're both handsome.

05:50.988 --> 05:53.389
Pam is gonna choose
whoever has a scent

05:53.457 --> 05:55.141
Most like that of her father.

05:55.225 --> 05:57.060
Does anyone remember
what her dad smelled like?

05:57.127 --> 05:58.811
- I think he...
- hey, hey, gang, quiet.

05:58.896 --> 06:00.596
Here she comes.

06:00.664 --> 06:01.931
Did you hear about
that Danny guy?

06:01.982 --> 06:04.317
Heard he used to date Pam.

06:04.401 --> 06:05.468
So, four years ago,

06:05.536 --> 06:06.970
When I was in Stanford,
Connecticut

06:07.037 --> 06:08.938
And dating someone else...
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.989 --> 06:10.707
Pam went on two dates
with Danny.

06:10.774 --> 06:11.774
Which was obviously

06:11.842 --> 06:13.176
The greatest love story
ever told,

06:13.243 --> 06:15.628
Given how much people are
walking on eggshells around us.

06:15.696 --> 06:17.413
We were basically
Romeo and Juliet.

06:17.481 --> 06:18.665
- That's right.
- Except where Juliet

06:18.749 --> 06:19.916
Doesn't have that great a time,

06:19.984 --> 06:21.884
And Romeo doesn't call back
after two dates.

06:21.952 --> 06:22.986
Yikes.

06:23.053 --> 06:25.338
But I've learned to love again.

06:25.422 --> 06:27.490
He's a cartoon sailor.
 no.

06:27.558 --> 06:29.625
And he looks so handsome
in his uniform.

06:29.677 --> 06:31.227
<i>Please.
No, I'm not gonna... no.</i>

06:31.295 --> 06:32.695
Tuna.

06:32.763 --> 06:35.131
Tuna.

06:35.199 --> 06:36.849
If you want us
to skip this party...

06:36.934 --> 06:37.850
I don't care.

06:37.935 --> 06:39.569
I am never gonna forget

06:39.636 --> 06:40.820
What Danny did to Pam.

06:40.904 --> 06:43.006
I forget nothing.

06:43.073 --> 06:44.741
I'm like an elephant
in that way.

06:44.808 --> 06:46.325
You know what eleph...
buh... this...

06:46.410 --> 06:48.277
This sucks for Jim, right?

06:48.345 --> 06:49.846
But it also sucks for us,

06:49.913 --> 06:52.749
Because we don't get invited
to a ton of Halloween parties.

06:52.816 --> 06:55.251
Yeah, and, like,
everyone's gonna be there.

06:55.319 --> 06:59.505
Stanley, Phyllis, Angela,

06:59.590 --> 07:02.158
Darryl, creed's a maybe.

07:02.209 --> 07:03.226
Creed's going?

07:05.495 --> 07:07.797
Madge from the warehouse

07:07.848 --> 07:09.365
Just made her first sale.

07:09.433 --> 07:10.550
Madge.

07:10.634 --> 07:12.602
We should have been doing this
a long time ago.

07:16.373 --> 07:20.443
Erin, would you please
do me a solid...

07:20.511 --> 07:23.746
And get Darryl Philbin
on the speakerphone.

07:27.868 --> 07:28.901
Hello.

07:28.986 --> 07:31.871
Hi, Darryl.
Come out here, please.

07:31.955 --> 07:33.072
I'm good.

07:33.157 --> 07:34.791
You need to stop being so shy.

07:34.858 --> 07:36.559
Come out here and embrace
who you really are,

07:36.627 --> 07:37.627
Superstar.

07:37.694 --> 07:39.045
This is embarrassing, Michael.

07:39.129 --> 07:40.463
Yeah, I bet it is.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.065
If you're gonna do your job
well here...

07:42.132 --> 07:44.133
You gotta get used
to being embarrassed.

07:44.201 --> 07:45.435
Let me put my shoes on.

07:48.338 --> 07:51.107
Um, hit
the speakerphone button.

07:51.175 --> 07:53.142
The speakerphone button?

07:53.210 --> 07:54.844
Same button as you hit before.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.730
Or sit on it.

07:57.815 --> 08:00.266
This whole delivery/sales idea,

08:00.350 --> 08:01.651
You know whose that was?

08:01.718 --> 08:03.286
That was Darryl Philbin's.

08:03.353 --> 08:07.273
He thought of that way before
the corporate fat suits.

08:07.357 --> 08:08.424
So what happened?

08:08.492 --> 08:11.260
I got in the way.
I said no.

08:11.328 --> 08:13.596
And it just stopped.

08:13.664 --> 08:16.582
But then, corporate
comes up with this idea.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.733
But you know what?

08:17.785 --> 08:20.369
They need to know
that it was yours.

08:20.437 --> 08:21.938
And I don't care
if I take a bullet,

08:22.005 --> 08:23.272
We're going to call them.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.674
We're going to put them
on speakerphone right now.

08:25.876 --> 08:29.045
And we are going
to straighten this out.

08:29.096 --> 08:30.096
Screw corporate.

08:30.180 --> 08:31.597
They probably stole
the idea anyway.

08:32.765 --> 08:34.133
Corporate stole nothing.

08:34.217 --> 08:35.852
Okay? Darryl brought
this idea to me,

08:35.919 --> 08:37.636
And then I told them,
giving Darryl full credit.

08:37.721 --> 08:40.490
So no need
to "screw corporate."

08:40.557 --> 08:42.325
Everyone, let's give Darryl
a round of applause

08:42.392 --> 08:43.493
As planned.

08:49.832 --> 08:50.965
I'm a little peeved
at Darryl right now.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.016
He went to Gabe
behind your back.

08:52.084 --> 08:53.418
No, he didn't
go behind my back,

08:53.469 --> 08:54.636
He went over my head.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.255
He went over your head
to go behind your back.

08:57.323 --> 08:59.824
What is taking someone
from behind?

08:59.892 --> 09:01.659
No, shh, Michael, listen.
This cannot stand.

09:01.727 --> 09:03.261
We can't have workers
going straight to corporate.

09:03.329 --> 09:04.762
It makes your job superfluous.

09:04.830 --> 09:06.164
It was a good idea, though.

09:06.232 --> 09:07.432
Yeah, here's another good idea.

09:07.483 --> 09:10.968
Corporate chain of command.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.489
We need to strangle
Darryl's idea.

09:14.573 --> 09:16.508
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey.

09:16.575 --> 09:17.992
I'm really sorry,

09:18.077 --> 09:19.861
But we can't come
to your party tonight.

09:19.945 --> 09:20.978
Ah, I was looking forward

09:21.030 --> 09:22.146
To throwing some darts
with you guys.

09:22.198 --> 09:23.131
- Well...
- Okay, well, then,

09:23.199 --> 09:25.149
Maybe we could do it...

09:25.201 --> 09:26.951
Like next Halloween.

09:27.019 --> 09:28.336
- Oh, for sure.
- We're just, like,

09:28.420 --> 09:29.687
Totally caught
in the middle here.

09:29.755 --> 09:31.005
What are you talking about?

09:31.090 --> 09:34.008
Well, Jim and Pam basically
begged us not to go.

09:34.093 --> 09:36.027
Jim and Pam really
don't want you to go?

09:36.095 --> 09:37.378
They're really upset

09:37.463 --> 09:39.497
About the whole
Danny situation.

09:39.565 --> 09:40.998
I'll talk to them.

09:41.050 --> 09:42.667
Yeah, but just don't tell them

09:42.718 --> 09:44.335
That we said anything to you.

09:44.386 --> 09:45.670
Okay?
Okay.

09:45.738 --> 09:47.572
Or you're dead.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.673
Okay.

09:48.724 --> 09:51.809
Okay.

09:51.861 --> 09:53.561
Kelly.

09:53.646 --> 09:54.729
Great costume.

09:54.813 --> 09:56.147
- Thanks.
- Oh...

09:56.215 --> 09:57.749
Kelly! You cannot
change costumes

09:57.816 --> 09:59.150
In the middle of the day!

09:59.218 --> 10:00.869
Pam, she's out.

10:00.953 --> 10:02.019
Um, if I'm out,

10:02.071 --> 10:03.221
I'm gonna Sue
this entire company

10:03.289 --> 10:04.556
For discrimination!

10:04.623 --> 10:07.258
Guys, you're arguing over
a 1 in 16 chance.

10:07.326 --> 10:09.827
Over a prize worth...
40 bucks.

10:09.879 --> 10:11.162
Um, 15,000 bucks, Oscar.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.997
Yeah, shut it, Oscar.
Pam.

10:13.065 --> 10:14.599
This is an amazing prize.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.734
I mean, I don't even want
to give Pam a compliment

10:16.802 --> 10:17.902
'cause she's so blech.

10:17.970 --> 10:20.038
But she did a good job.

10:20.105 --> 10:21.673
I really want that coupon book.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.041
Garbage magnet.
Garbage magnet.

10:24.093 --> 10:26.394
God, magnets
are interesting enough.

10:26.478 --> 10:29.714
You don't need to tart 'em up
with some design.

10:29.765 --> 10:32.734
I can't believe
this doesn't make you mad.

10:32.818 --> 10:34.402
What the hell
are they talking about?

10:34.486 --> 10:36.187
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe.

10:36.255 --> 10:38.723
Probably about the extremes of
the human physique.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.391
Do you think Kevin
is going over my head?

10:40.442 --> 10:41.960
I don't... oh, my God.

10:42.027 --> 10:43.361
Okay, all right!
All right!

10:43.429 --> 10:45.029
All right, you know what?

10:45.097 --> 10:46.781
That's inappropriate, Kevin.

10:46.865 --> 10:49.400
I am your boss, and if you
have something to say,

10:49.468 --> 10:50.602
It goes through me,

10:50.669 --> 10:52.136
And then I take it to Gabe.

10:52.204 --> 10:53.738
Chain of command.
Do you understand?

10:53.789 --> 10:55.573
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?

10:55.641 --> 10:57.475
- I just thought...
- what did you just thought?

10:57.543 --> 11:01.045
Well, Gabe asked me
if there were any really cool

11:01.113 --> 11:04.966
Lady gaga moves that
he could do for the catwalk,

11:05.050 --> 11:07.385
And so then I told...
All right.

11:07.453 --> 11:10.021
I told him that there
was this one cool move

11:10.088 --> 11:12.390
Where she powers down
like a robot.

11:12.458 --> 11:13.825
Okay.

11:13.892 --> 11:16.811
Okay? But I'm so sorry
that I didn't tell you first.

11:16.895 --> 11:19.147
Well,
don't let it happen again.

11:19.231 --> 11:21.032
You think that I
would let this happen again?

11:21.099 --> 11:23.801
No way, Jose!

11:23.869 --> 11:25.269
I'm...

11:27.072 --> 11:27.989
you, Gabe.

11:28.073 --> 11:29.607
Okay.

11:29.675 --> 11:31.909
Can you imagine?
It's just crazy.

11:31.961 --> 11:33.294
That is crazy.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.964
We would never care if Andy
or Kevin went to your party.

11:36.048 --> 11:38.016
Look, I'm just glad
we can laugh about it,

11:38.083 --> 11:40.385
Because I was a little nervous
about coming to work here

11:40.452 --> 11:41.970
With, you know, our history.

11:42.054 --> 11:43.154
Oh, my gosh.

11:43.222 --> 11:45.056
Everyone keeps blowing
that out of proportion.

11:45.124 --> 11:46.674
It's not even a history.
Exactly.

11:46.759 --> 11:50.395
It's not like you guys had
some long relationship, right?

11:50.462 --> 11:52.480
Big, painful breakup
I don't know about?

11:52.564 --> 11:54.015
- Two or three dates.
- It was two.

11:54.099 --> 11:55.700
Was it two?
I thought it was three.

11:55.768 --> 11:57.001
No, we, um...

11:57.069 --> 11:58.469
We had plans for a third,

11:58.537 --> 11:59.470
But then, I don't know,

11:59.521 --> 12:00.688
You never called me back, so...

12:00.773 --> 12:02.824
Ooh.
You can't handle the truth.

12:03.909 --> 12:05.360
Well,
that does not sound like me.

12:05.444 --> 12:06.944
Yeah. It was, though.

12:06.996 --> 12:10.748
That's what happened.

12:10.816 --> 12:12.083
Well, great.

12:12.150 --> 12:14.052
I just wanted to make sure
things weren't weird.

12:17.873 --> 12:20.508
Okay, this whole
"going over my head gate"

12:20.592 --> 12:22.093
Is making people act weird.

12:22.161 --> 12:23.494
Chain of command is crumbling.

12:23.562 --> 12:24.662
Do you know what just happened?

12:24.713 --> 12:25.663
I just made Kevin cry.

12:25.714 --> 12:27.699
And Gabe looks like lady gaga.

12:27.766 --> 12:29.200
That's not Halloween.

12:29.268 --> 12:32.637
Halloween should be a day
in which we honor monsters

12:32.705 --> 12:33.855
And not be mad at each other.

12:33.939 --> 12:35.940
I'm not mad.
Are you mad?

12:36.007 --> 12:38.443
You went over my head,
and then you lied to my face,

12:38.510 --> 12:40.895
So my head and my face
have taken a beating.

12:40.979 --> 12:43.748
Well, I'm sorry
if it seems that way to you.

12:43.816 --> 12:44.982
Okay, that might help,

12:45.034 --> 12:46.951
If you said "I'm sorry"
in front of everybody...

12:47.019 --> 12:48.069
- Mike.
- In front of me.

12:48.153 --> 12:49.721
You made a bad call.

12:49.788 --> 12:51.622
And I fixed it.

12:51.690 --> 12:52.790
So I'm not apologizing.

12:52.858 --> 12:55.293
So that's it?

12:55.360 --> 12:57.095
- That's it.
- Is it?

12:57.162 --> 13:01.966
Yes.

13:02.033 --> 13:05.636
Suck it.

13:05.704 --> 13:07.572
<i>Bill Compton
from true blood.</i>

13:07.639 --> 13:09.107
How many freakin' vampires

13:09.174 --> 13:10.892
Am I supposed
to care about these days?

13:10.976 --> 13:13.043
I guess you could say
I'm still in costume.

13:13.095 --> 13:16.547
I'm a rational consumer.

13:16.598 --> 13:18.599
Oh, yeah.

13:19.601 --> 13:22.103
Stupid coupon booklet.

13:22.187 --> 13:24.989
You see my costume?
I'm a rational consumer.

13:25.057 --> 13:26.157
Yeah, I heard you say it
to Phyllis.

13:26.225 --> 13:27.358
That's a good line.

13:27.409 --> 13:30.027
Okay, everybody,
after you walk the runway,

13:30.079 --> 13:32.613
Everyone has to vote
for who gets the coupon book,

13:32.698 --> 13:34.232
And you can't
vote for yourself.

13:34.299 --> 13:36.567
Pam, can you vote
for other people?

13:36.618 --> 13:37.568
Got to get in on this.

13:37.619 --> 13:39.620
Hey, it's cool, man.

13:39.705 --> 13:41.089
I work in the warehouse.

13:41.173 --> 13:42.707
I'm cool!

13:42.775 --> 13:44.742
I'm hip and I'm jive,

13:44.810 --> 13:47.128
But I don't care about nobody!

13:47.212 --> 13:48.913
Do you know who I am?

13:48.981 --> 13:51.415
Happy Halloween, jerk!

13:55.438 --> 13:57.406
Still don't know who I am?
I'll give you a hint.

13:57.473 --> 13:59.007
I go over other people's heads.

13:59.075 --> 14:00.876
Michael, this is a bad idea.

14:00.944 --> 14:01.860
What's a bad idea?

14:01.945 --> 14:03.045
Dressing up as somebody...

14:03.112 --> 14:04.980
I mean, when has that
ever worked for you?

14:05.048 --> 14:06.064
Never!

14:06.132 --> 14:08.417
Okay, you know what?
Fine.

14:08.484 --> 14:10.018
I'm not Darryl.

14:10.086 --> 14:11.553
And thank God I'm not Darryl.

14:11.621 --> 14:13.705
Could you for once
just let us enjoy a party

14:13.773 --> 14:17.376
Instead of making it
about all your issues?

14:17.460 --> 14:20.212
♪ get a jolt
from my electrode ♪

14:21.397 --> 14:23.765
♪ they did the monster mash ♪

14:23.833 --> 14:24.766
♪ the monster mash ♪

14:27.103 --> 14:28.053

14:28.137 --> 14:31.406
Yes. Yeah.

14:31.474 --> 14:33.375

14:33.443 --> 14:36.879
I present to you

14:43.052 --> 14:46.421

14:46.489 --> 14:48.390

14:49.459 --> 14:50.659
Don't... slow it down.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.660
There it is.

14:51.711 --> 14:52.661
I don't like your tone.

14:52.729 --> 14:54.079
Look, they were sold out

14:54.163 --> 14:57.366
Of all the other costumes,
okay?

14:57.433 --> 14:59.468
Think we all live
in the real world here.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.553
Let's not pretend to be unaware

15:01.638 --> 15:03.305
Of what sells in this office.

15:03.373 --> 15:04.539
What should we ask?

15:04.607 --> 15:06.108
Hey, can I play?

15:06.175 --> 15:09.595
Why don't you ask
if Darryl is a bad friend

15:09.679 --> 15:11.213
Who backstabs people
in the back?

15:11.281 --> 15:13.599
We have one question
to ask the spirit world,

15:13.683 --> 15:14.616
And you want us to ask that?

15:14.684 --> 15:16.285
He says no.

15:16.352 --> 15:18.153
Ah, Darryl moved it.
You moved it.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.588
No.

15:19.656 --> 15:22.057
Hey, Dwight,
you saw Darryl move it, right?

15:22.125 --> 15:23.609
Let's just say I saw

15:23.693 --> 15:26.461
Exactly what the two of you
wanted me to see.

15:26.529 --> 15:27.496
I know how to sit on a fence.

15:27.563 --> 15:30.499
Hell, I can even
sleep on a fence.

15:30.566 --> 15:32.234
The trick is to do it face down

15:32.302 --> 15:34.169
With the post in your mouth.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.371
If you had one word you
would use to describe Darryl,

15:36.439 --> 15:39.124
What would that word be?

15:39.208 --> 15:42.094
"a"...

15:42.178 --> 15:43.879
"s"...

15:43.930 --> 15:48.300
"s".

15:48.384 --> 15:50.085
"h".
No.

15:51.354 --> 15:52.955
"e"...

15:53.022 --> 15:54.156
"t".

15:54.223 --> 15:55.457
An asset.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.626
Aah!
Aah!

15:59.195 --> 16:01.163
That's enough.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.134
I don't think it's gonna
work out the way you think.

16:06.202 --> 16:08.870
I don't think you get it.

16:10.707 --> 16:12.124
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.408
This is some party, huh?

16:13.476 --> 16:15.243
When you work hard,
you play hard around here.

16:15.294 --> 16:16.979
Even if you don't work hard.

16:19.716 --> 16:22.217
Oh, here's something.
Mm?

16:22.285 --> 16:25.153
Uh, why didn't you
ever call Pam back?

16:25.221 --> 16:26.505
Are you serious?

16:26.589 --> 16:28.256
Yeah.

16:28.307 --> 16:29.725
I mean, I'm not saying
that everybody

16:29.792 --> 16:30.959
Has to fall in love
or anything.

16:31.010 --> 16:32.127
I'm just saying,
but to, you know,

16:32.178 --> 16:33.528
To not even call her back is...

16:33.596 --> 16:34.529
Know what it was?

16:34.597 --> 16:35.897
I think she gave me her number,

16:35.965 --> 16:38.133
But then, like, her fours
looked like eights, and then...

16:38.201 --> 16:39.267
Could be.

16:39.318 --> 16:41.302
But you also
called her the second time,

16:41.354 --> 16:42.637
So you had the number right.

16:42.705 --> 16:46.208
Halpert, you looking
for someone to bang your wife?

16:46.275 --> 16:48.410
- Nope.
- Okay.

16:48.478 --> 16:51.546
You want to know?

16:51.614 --> 16:52.781
I didn't call her back

16:52.832 --> 16:55.050
Because she spent the whole date
talking about you.

16:55.118 --> 16:58.320
She was obviously
in love with you.

16:58.388 --> 17:00.522
♪ grooving from side to side ♪

17:00.590 --> 17:02.491
57, 58.

17:02.558 --> 17:03.875
Wait, she hasn't moved
in a while.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.127
Erin. Er...

17:05.178 --> 17:06.678
Two.
I got two.

17:06.762 --> 17:08.346
I ate two whole apples.

17:12.435 --> 17:14.703
I'd remember talking about Jim.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.188
That wasn't it.

17:16.271 --> 17:18.240
Just tell her the real reason.

17:18.307 --> 17:19.724
You honestly want to know

17:19.809 --> 17:21.843
Why I didn't call her back
on a date over four years ago?

17:21.894 --> 17:24.029
Hey, she had a nice time.
It seems rude.

17:24.113 --> 17:25.380
I did. Yeah.

17:25.448 --> 17:26.531
And it's one of those things

17:26.616 --> 17:28.016
That's just gonna keep
gnawing at me.

17:28.084 --> 17:29.701
Like gnaw, gnaw.
"why? Why didn't he?

17:29.786 --> 17:30.952
I have no idea why."
okay.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.721
Honestly,
I didn't call you back

17:32.789 --> 17:36.124
'cause I thought
you seemed a little...

17:36.192 --> 17:40.128
Dorky.

17:40.196 --> 17:41.830
- Hey, man...
- Thank you.

17:41.881 --> 17:42.831
Thank you.

17:42.882 --> 17:44.366
I got it.

17:44.434 --> 17:46.368
Now I know.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.503
You thought
I was a little dorky.

17:48.554 --> 17:52.140
You know?

17:52.208 --> 17:53.141
Okay.

17:53.209 --> 17:57.229
Well, excuse me.

17:58.714 --> 17:59.648
In the future, you need

17:59.715 --> 18:00.715
To get Michael's approval

18:00.767 --> 18:02.417
On anything
before coming to me.

18:02.485 --> 18:03.618
Thank you.

18:03.686 --> 18:05.387
You're gonna miss out
on some good ideas.

18:05.455 --> 18:06.688
Okay, well, obviously,

18:06.756 --> 18:08.023
If it's a really...
really good idea,

18:08.074 --> 18:09.557
Then my door is open to that.

18:09.609 --> 18:12.027
If they're good ideas,
I'm not gonna say no.

18:12.078 --> 18:13.779
- You said no to this one.
- That's... okay.

18:13.863 --> 18:15.864
I make one mistake in 15 years

18:15.932 --> 18:17.332
And you drag me over the coals.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.733
After everything I did for you?

18:18.801 --> 18:20.235
- What have you done for me?
- Oh...

18:20.286 --> 18:21.903
- What have you done for me?
- Well...

18:21.971 --> 18:24.906
Ed truck hired me.
Jo promoted me.

18:24.974 --> 18:26.775
Gabe listened to me.

18:26.843 --> 18:31.096
All you've ever done
was say no to me.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.348
I have ambition.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.750
And you kept me
at the same level for years.

18:35.818 --> 18:39.688
Oh, dropping bombs, right?

18:39.755 --> 18:41.106
Must really make you think,
Michael.

18:41.190 --> 18:44.392
Stop it. Stop. Stop.
We're thinking.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.261
We're thinking about it.
Yeah.

18:46.329 --> 18:47.462
You don't have to point
to the fact

18:47.530 --> 18:48.497
That we're thinking about it.

18:48.564 --> 18:51.766
Stop it.
Just let us think.

18:51.834 --> 18:55.237
Okay, next time you have
a really great idea,

18:55.304 --> 18:57.973
We will put it in a hat

18:58.040 --> 19:00.208
And then we will have Erin
pick it out of the hat

19:00.276 --> 19:01.443
And let her decide.

19:01.511 --> 19:03.044
I don't understand the point
of the hat.

19:03.112 --> 19:04.379
You're right.
We don't need a hat.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.815
I am not budging
on the hat issue.

19:06.883 --> 19:08.834
Okay, we're gonna table
the hat question.

19:08.918 --> 19:10.802
The best ideas
are gonna come to me.

19:10.887 --> 19:13.171
I make the final decision.
Period.

19:13.256 --> 19:16.124
Okay. We both reserve
the right to go to Jo

19:16.192 --> 19:17.459
If we disagree with Gabe.

19:17.527 --> 19:19.361
- Okay.
- Fair enough.

19:19.428 --> 19:20.929
Why don't we simplify this?

19:20.980 --> 19:23.865
Darryl brings it to Michael.
Michael brings it to me.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.668
No one calls Jo.

19:26.736 --> 19:28.837
Unless you and I decide
we want to talk to Jo.

19:28.905 --> 19:31.640
Then we'll give her a call.
Cool.

19:31.707 --> 19:33.441
Yeah. I'm sorry I lied to you.

19:33.492 --> 19:37.478
I'm sorry.
I was a jerk.

19:37.530 --> 19:41.249
Friends fight.
Friends fight.

19:41.317 --> 19:42.250
What's up, man?

19:42.318 --> 19:43.652
Sometimes it seems like

19:43.719 --> 19:45.921
It was better down
in the warehouse, you know?

19:45.988 --> 19:47.389
When I was a freshman
in college,

19:47.456 --> 19:49.090
I worked
at the student newspaper,

19:49.158 --> 19:51.492
<i>The Cornell daily sun.
This was at Cornell.</i>

19:51.544 --> 19:55.096
I had to write an op-ed column
Bernard's regards.

19:55.164 --> 19:56.998
This was your freshman year?

19:57.066 --> 20:00.535
I started to ask myself
"do I have big plans here?"

20:00.603 --> 20:02.571
I didn't want to become editor
of that paper.

20:02.638 --> 20:06.057
So I got up and walked right out
of Walter Bernard hall.

20:06.142 --> 20:08.543
And that's actually
when I heard

20:08.611 --> 20:12.013
Eight male voices singing,

20:12.064 --> 20:14.916
Unencumbered by instruments.

20:14.984 --> 20:16.418
I was hooked.

20:16.485 --> 20:21.907
So is becoming CEO
of this company

20:21.991 --> 20:25.527
Your a cappella group?

20:25.595 --> 20:26.962
Come on.
We're going to Danny's bar.

20:27.029 --> 20:27.963
Public school.

20:28.030 --> 20:29.731
No, I got some work to do.

20:29.799 --> 20:33.401
I do have big plans
at this company.

20:37.723 --> 20:39.040
To be honest,
I still can't believe

20:39.091 --> 20:40.308
He didn't call her back.

20:40.376 --> 20:44.613
Who doesn't call a dork
like that back?

20:48.484 --> 20:51.319
Spinach in a can.
Powerful spinach.

20:51.387 --> 20:53.905
A-gah-gah-gah-gah.
- Aw, my hero.

20:57.937 --> 21:00.138
Okay, everyone,
I've tallied the votes.

21:00.206 --> 21:04.209
And the winner of the costume
celebration spectacular

21:04.276 --> 21:07.145
And the Scranton/Wilkes-barre
coupon book, Oscar Martinez.

21:07.213 --> 21:12.250
Really?

21:13.335 --> 21:14.711
If I have to vote for someone

21:14.815 --> 21:16.439
I don't want it to be
someone who can be me.

21:17.983 --> 21:20.463
Shake things up.
I'm an inner guy.

21:21.712 --> 21:25.574
Best Edward James ** costume
I've ever seen.

21:26.766 --> 21:27.767
Like freaky good.
