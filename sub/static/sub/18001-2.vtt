00:05.643 --> 00:09.169
<i>(Theme music playing)</i>

00:10.638 --> 00:12.938
Pretty safe bet to say that Batman's

00:12.973 --> 00:15.140
one of the most popular
superheroes ever, right?

00:15.192 --> 00:16.140
Both: Yeah.

00:16.193 --> 00:17.142
Let's take a little vote.

00:17.194 --> 00:18.810
Should Batman kill?

00:18.862 --> 00:21.697
I've always marveled at
his ability to hold back.

00:21.732 --> 00:24.483
- So no kill.
- No kill.

00:24.535 --> 00:26.368
- Mike?
- He has killed before, so...

00:26.403 --> 00:27.452
Who?

00:27.488 --> 00:29.571
He... he let the Joker die.

00:29.623 --> 00:32.156
Well, the Joker didn't die,
but he didn't do anything

00:32.209 --> 00:35.127
to save the Joker when
the Joker killed Robin.

00:35.162 --> 00:36.995
- Mike, yes or no?
- [Laughter]

00:37.047 --> 00:38.830
- Yes, he should kill, yes.
- Yes?

00:38.882 --> 00:39.915
Wow, Mike,

00:39.967 --> 00:41.333
- going out on a limb here.
- Wow.

00:41.385 --> 00:43.252
I think he should too,
because if I was Batman,

00:43.304 --> 00:46.555
I would be pissed at whoever's
in charge of these jails.

00:46.590 --> 00:48.807
I'd be like, would you
stop letting them out,

00:48.842 --> 00:50.676
for Christ's sakes? What do I have to do?

00:50.728 --> 00:51.893
Do I got to kill 'em? [Laughter]

00:51.929 --> 00:53.312
- I guess I got to kill 'em.
- Yeah.

00:53.347 --> 00:56.315
[Laughter]

00:56.350 --> 00:58.734

<i>Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:35.055 --> 01:36.805
the only show that got
a clean bill of health

01:36.807 --> 01:40.809
from Doctor Who, doctor fate,
doctor strange, and doctor doom.

01:40.811 --> 01:42.728
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.613
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

01:44.648 --> 01:45.897
- Ming Chen.
- All right, man,

01:45.949 --> 01:47.816
you sling comics for a
living. It's hard work.

01:47.818 --> 01:48.950
Tell me about it.

01:48.986 --> 01:50.619
One of the things I
often fantasize about

01:50.654 --> 01:55.123
is losing my memory and
rediscovering comic books again.

01:55.159 --> 01:56.825
Mm.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.247
Hi. What can I do for you?

02:02.299 --> 02:03.832
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

02:03.884 --> 02:05.133
I'm looking to piece together

02:05.169 --> 02:06.968
<i>Frank Miller's the Dark Knight Returns.</i>

02:07.004 --> 02:07.969
- Really?
- Yes.

02:08.005 --> 02:09.638
Are you a Batman fan?

02:09.673 --> 02:11.306
Brand new to it, but yes, I am.

02:11.342 --> 02:12.808
Oh, a newbie, huh? Excellent.

02:12.843 --> 02:14.643
<i>Excellent choice, Frank
Miller's Dark Knight.</i>

02:14.678 --> 02:15.761
Yes.

02:15.813 --> 02:18.063
The greatest Batman
story maybe ever told.

02:18.098 --> 02:20.065
He's 55, still kicking butt.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.516
- Oh, you've read it?
- I've read it.

02:21.568 --> 02:23.935
- Oh, okay.
- It's my first one I've read.

02:23.987 --> 02:25.987
What happened was, my
boyfriend let me borrow a copy.

02:26.023 --> 02:27.489
- Okay.
- So now I want my own.

02:27.524 --> 02:30.359
I think we do have a
set of Dark Knight Returns,

02:30.361 --> 02:32.361
- don't we?
- Yeah, I'll go grab it.

02:38.535 --> 02:40.702
This is great. Oh,
my gosh, I'm so excited.

02:40.754 --> 02:42.037
- Yeah, so cool.
- It's not the trade.

02:42.089 --> 02:44.172
- Okay.
- All four individual issues.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.457
Great, that's exactly
what I was looking for.

02:45.509 --> 02:46.675
[Laughs]

02:46.710 --> 02:48.210
Oh, you see that? I heard some chuckles

02:48.212 --> 02:49.544
back there. [Girls laughing]

02:49.596 --> 02:52.047
Your friends are giggling
at your passion for Batman.

02:52.049 --> 02:53.799
Yeah, we have some
nonbelievers in the back.

02:53.851 --> 02:55.884
I had to drag them here on
our way to New York City,

02:55.936 --> 02:57.853
- but...
- Are you girls totally like,

02:57.888 --> 03:00.021
- "O-M-G, she's a nerd"?
- [Laughter]

03:00.057 --> 03:02.724
I don't think your friends
realize that this set right here

03:02.776 --> 03:06.895
is Batman: The dark knight
returns parts 1, 2, 3, and 4

03:06.947 --> 03:09.364
in the original comic
book form, first prints.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.532
- Oh, my gosh.
- First print, I don't...

03:10.567 --> 03:12.117
now you realize that, you're...

03:12.152 --> 03:13.902
- [Laughter]
- Much more impressed, right?

03:13.954 --> 03:16.538
- No, I see smiles here.
- I see smiles, I love it.

03:16.573 --> 03:20.409
What first prints means is
that these came out in 1986.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.794
Oh, that was a good
year, the year we graduated.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.212
Older than us.

03:24.248 --> 03:26.415
[Laughter]

03:26.467 --> 03:29.835
That type of Doe-Eyed
neophyte to the world of comics

03:29.887 --> 03:32.671
is quite like who I was when
we first started hanging out,

03:32.723 --> 03:35.757
<i>and you handed me a copy
of the dark knight returns,</i>

03:35.809 --> 03:39.594
and I came back the next
day like I'd been baptized.

03:39.646 --> 03:42.814
[Laughter]

03:42.850 --> 03:47.319
Oh, man, I cannot tell
you how excited I am for you,

03:47.354 --> 03:52.607
because this is just a doorway
into a new world of adventure,

03:52.659 --> 03:54.776
action, intrigue.

03:54.828 --> 03:57.829
- Less friends.
- [Laughter]

03:57.865 --> 03:59.865
So none of your friends are into comics?

03:59.917 --> 04:01.283
- Not particularly.
- [Laughter]

04:01.335 --> 04:02.751
I mean, you guys aren't into comics.

04:02.786 --> 04:04.252
What are you into?

04:04.288 --> 04:06.254
- What are you into, Adrienne?
- Drinking.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.790
[Laughter]

04:08.792 --> 04:11.793
- Just definitely not comics.
- [Laughter]

04:11.795 --> 04:14.129
- Oh! Oh.
- [Laughter]

04:14.181 --> 04:15.847
She was actually a pretty brave newbie.

04:15.883 --> 04:17.132
She was taking a stand, you know?

04:17.134 --> 04:19.851
She was putting that freak
flag right in the ground

04:19.887 --> 04:22.604
and saying, "I'm here and I'm proud."

04:22.639 --> 04:23.972
So all her friends wanted to get drunk,

04:23.974 --> 04:26.024
but she was like, "it's Miller time."

04:26.059 --> 04:27.392
Oh! [Laughter]

04:27.444 --> 04:30.111
- Na-a-a-a.
- [Laughter]

04:30.147 --> 04:32.397
<i>See, Frank Miller, he wrote
the dark knight returns.</i>

04:32.449 --> 04:33.398
You guys are nerds.

04:33.450 --> 04:34.816
[Laughter]

04:34.818 --> 04:36.485
I mean, I don't want
to keep your friends here.

04:36.487 --> 04:37.736
Looks like they're
ready to get to New York.

04:37.788 --> 04:38.787
All: Yeah.
- I'm gonna have an ear load

04:38.822 --> 04:39.788
on the way back.

04:39.823 --> 04:40.956
This is a great first pick.

04:40.991 --> 04:42.324
So just ring it up? You're all set?

04:42.376 --> 04:44.042
Yup, I'm all set. 60's great.

04:44.077 --> 04:46.745
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

04:46.797 --> 04:49.381
Now we have to get back on the road.

04:49.416 --> 04:51.521
Enjoy New York, girls.
Don't have too much fun.

04:51.521 --> 04:52.250
<i>We have sights to go see.</i>

04:52.302 --> 04:54.135
We will. I don't know about these guys,

04:54.171 --> 04:55.136
- but...
- [Laughter]

04:55.172 --> 04:56.254
- Enjoy, bye.
- Thank you.

04:56.306 --> 04:58.006
- Thank you, guys.
- See you guys later.

05:05.599 --> 05:06.731
- Gentlemen, how are you today?
- How you been?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.433
- Holy mackerel.
- What's going on?

05:08.485 --> 05:09.768
Hey, how are you, buddy?
Good to see you again.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.069
You remember this guy, right?

05:11.104 --> 05:13.522
Wow. Look at this.

05:13.524 --> 05:14.940
What is all this crap?

05:14.992 --> 05:16.908
This is the G.I. Joe U.S.S. Flagg.

05:16.944 --> 05:18.944
Oh, my God, that's right.
You're a doctor, right?

05:18.996 --> 05:20.412
- Yeah.
- That's right, I remember you.

05:20.447 --> 05:22.914
So, yeah, doc had come in
with one of the few toys

05:22.950 --> 05:25.116
I had not gotten to play with as a kid.

05:25.168 --> 05:27.669
So your rosebud of toys.

05:27.704 --> 05:30.088
Yes, that's a perfect analogy.

05:30.123 --> 05:35.460
This man has just brought in
the creme de la creme of toys.

05:35.512 --> 05:38.630
Hey, boys, come back here
and check out what we built.

05:38.682 --> 05:40.348
Gaze upon perfection.

05:45.038 --> 05:46.771
This man has just brought in

05:46.807 --> 05:48.707
The Planet Of The Apes Treehouse,

05:48.742 --> 05:51.826
the creme de la creme of toys.

05:59.853 --> 06:04.673
The numero uno at the top
of every young boy's list.

06:04.725 --> 06:06.307
Look at that face on that kid.

06:06.343 --> 06:11.312
I mean, that's every boy
in America in 1974, right?

06:11.348 --> 06:14.015
If they got it. [Laughter]

06:14.067 --> 06:15.233
That's you?

06:15.268 --> 06:17.602
You actually cracked a smile in the '70s?

06:17.604 --> 06:21.740
[Laughter]

06:24.111 --> 06:25.326
'Cause I can't see it.

06:25.362 --> 06:27.162
Oh, I was cracking smiles in the '70s,

06:27.197 --> 06:29.781
but unfortunately, I wasn't this boy.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.917
I had a childhood filled with toys

06:32.953 --> 06:35.754
and everything I put on my Christmas list

06:35.789 --> 06:37.589
I usually got. I was a good kid.

06:37.624 --> 06:41.459
Santa was very good to me,
but for whatever reason,

06:41.511 --> 06:45.513
this is the one toy that I
never got as a kid that I wanted.

06:45.549 --> 06:47.182
Never was able to get it, though.

06:47.217 --> 06:50.969
This was the Barbie
dream house of boy toys.

06:51.021 --> 06:53.271
Like, you'd look at the girls
who had the Barbie dream house,

06:53.306 --> 06:54.723
you're like, "how come we
don't get anything like that?"

06:54.775 --> 06:57.776
They gave us the Mego
Batcave, but they also gave us

06:57.811 --> 06:59.694
the Mego Planet Of The Apes Treehouse.

06:59.730 --> 07:02.814
Oh, it was sweet.
And it comes in a massive box.

07:02.866 --> 07:05.450
I mean, it comes in a
box that just screams...

07:05.485 --> 07:07.318
my parents love me.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.654
[Laughter]

07:09.706 --> 07:10.989
I assume you're here to sell it,

07:10.991 --> 07:13.041
but why on earth are you
here to sell this today?

07:13.076 --> 07:14.743
You know, I've had this
for a couple years now,

07:14.795 --> 07:17.412
and it's time to make some
room for some new things.

07:17.464 --> 07:18.913
A couple of my buddies and I are going

07:18.965 --> 07:20.799
down to seaside heights
this weekend, so I figure

07:20.834 --> 07:24.169
I'd get a couple of cash
dollars in the pocket.

07:24.221 --> 07:26.054
Huh, you're selling this for beer money?

07:26.089 --> 07:27.255
[Laughter]

07:27.307 --> 07:30.141
You're a doctor, for Christ's sakes.

07:30.177 --> 07:31.676
What, have you lost your license

07:31.678 --> 07:34.562
since the last time we say you? [Laughter]

07:34.598 --> 07:36.898
You're gonna lose this
for a weekend of, like,

07:36.933 --> 07:39.150
debauchery on...
at seaside heights?

07:39.186 --> 07:40.935
No, I remember last year when I came in

07:40.987 --> 07:43.521
and I had the U.S.S.
Flagg aircraft carrier,

07:43.523 --> 07:46.241
ming was, you know, so
excited about that thing,

07:46.276 --> 07:47.859
and it was cool putting
it together with him.

07:47.861 --> 07:50.111
Now, you know, this, I
figured this is something

07:50.163 --> 07:52.197
that you would relate to.
I remember talking to you

07:52.249 --> 07:54.666
on the side last year
about how you like Megos

07:54.701 --> 07:57.118
and the different figures, and you know,

07:57.170 --> 07:59.220
what's a figure without a play set?

07:59.222 --> 08:02.190
- Oh, so you have figures too?
- Yeah, they're all inside.

08:02.225 --> 08:03.691
Would you mind if we popped it open,

08:03.727 --> 08:05.310
kind of set it up, you know make sure

08:05.362 --> 08:07.195
it's all working order.
I think that's fair.

08:07.230 --> 08:10.782
This is one of those
moments, to make this happen.

08:11.785 --> 08:13.318
- [Laughter]
- That's good.

08:13.370 --> 08:15.870
So it's painfully obvious to the doc

08:15.906 --> 08:17.655
and everybody else,
apparently, in the room,

08:17.707 --> 08:19.207
that I definitely want this.

08:19.242 --> 08:20.742
But I want to make sure
all the pieces are there.

08:20.794 --> 08:22.494
I want to make sure
it's a working Treehouse,

08:22.546 --> 08:23.912
the elevator, you know,

08:23.964 --> 08:25.497
everything's in working condition,

08:25.549 --> 08:27.165
and the doc let me put it together.

08:27.217 --> 08:28.500
Ohh.

08:28.552 --> 08:30.518
Oh, man, I've spent my whole lifetime

08:30.554 --> 08:31.886
waiting for this moment, I think.

08:31.922 --> 08:34.672
Well, here it is.

08:34.724 --> 08:35.807
[Sighs]

08:35.842 --> 08:38.176
- You mind if I do the honors?
- All yours.

08:41.097 --> 08:42.397
Now, do you need the instructions

08:42.432 --> 08:44.682
- to put this sucker together?
- Eh, I mean, you know,

08:44.734 --> 08:46.234
we could figure it out over time.

08:46.269 --> 08:47.769
- Oh.
- It's pretty simple.

08:47.804 --> 08:48.770
I mean, the apes did it.

08:51.858 --> 08:53.241
Perfect.

08:53.276 --> 08:54.826
We make a good team, bro.
Oh, thanks, buddy.

08:54.861 --> 08:55.944
These here.

08:55.946 --> 08:57.912
Doc and Walt sittin' in a tree.

08:57.948 --> 09:00.615
- [Laughs]
- "Hey, doc, let's play A-P-E."

09:00.667 --> 09:03.084
[Laughter]

09:03.119 --> 09:05.086
- Ohh.
- Oh, there they are.

09:05.121 --> 09:07.338
The little furry cuffs.

09:07.374 --> 09:09.541
I told my mom, man, I was
just like, "mom, can you make

09:09.593 --> 09:13.011
furry cuffs for all my shirts?"
When I was going to school.

09:13.046 --> 09:15.013
Thank God she didn't do it.

09:15.048 --> 09:17.632
[Laughs]

09:20.637 --> 09:22.136
- That's it.
- It's good.

09:22.189 --> 09:24.556
Final piece, huh?

09:24.608 --> 09:26.474
- This is a great play set.
- Oh, man.

09:30.113 --> 09:32.564
It's the best play set.

09:32.616 --> 09:35.316
They've never been able to
top it in all these years.

09:38.321 --> 09:40.038
What a piece of crap. [Both laughing]

09:40.073 --> 09:41.456
Seriously.

09:41.491 --> 09:44.542
Hey, boys, come back here
and check out what we built.

09:44.578 --> 09:46.961
Gaze upon perfection.

09:46.997 --> 09:48.496
Huh?

09:48.548 --> 09:50.548
- Oh, this is it?
- This is it, man.

09:50.584 --> 09:53.334
It does seem a little
meager in appearance.

09:53.336 --> 09:56.254
- It's very bare bones.
- They were apes.

09:56.306 --> 09:58.139
They weren't interior decorators.

09:58.174 --> 10:00.508
[Laughter]

10:00.560 --> 10:02.594
All right, doc, Treehouse...

10:02.646 --> 10:04.312
- Treehouse.
- With the three figures.

10:04.347 --> 10:05.480
What are you looking to get for it?

10:05.515 --> 10:07.432
500.

10:07.484 --> 10:08.816
- Really?
- Comes with the box.

10:08.852 --> 10:10.818
After the afternoon
we just spent together?

10:10.854 --> 10:12.654
Original box. 'Cause again, remember,

10:12.689 --> 10:15.023
kids would assemble it, throw the box away,

10:15.025 --> 10:17.492
so this is really what
makes it a complete set.

10:17.527 --> 10:18.826
I consider us friends,

10:18.862 --> 10:20.828
so I can say this without insulting you.

10:20.864 --> 10:22.497
Would you take 250 for it?

10:22.532 --> 10:23.498
It's not an insult, I'm not...
Ooh.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.617
250! 250? [Laughter]

10:25.669 --> 10:27.035
- Oh, it was that bad?
- Yeah.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.202
[Laughter]

10:28.204 --> 10:30.371
I'm insulted, it's not even mine.

10:30.423 --> 10:31.706
[Laughter]

10:31.758 --> 10:34.926
How about this, 335, and you throw in

10:34.961 --> 10:36.928
2 t-shirts from the secret stash?

10:36.963 --> 10:38.880
Come on, man. Um...

10:43.353 --> 10:46.804
335, 2 t-shirts from the stash?

10:46.856 --> 10:47.889
Yeah.

10:47.941 --> 10:50.475
Done. Thank you, brother.

10:50.527 --> 10:51.609
Is the magic still there?

10:51.645 --> 10:52.977
I mean, what are you gonna do with it now?

10:53.029 --> 10:56.030
I can't lie, the magic is still there.

10:56.066 --> 10:57.365
I mean, I don't even have to play with it.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.068
I just look at it in the
box and it does something.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.287
It must have been very
magical when your wife was like,

11:02.322 --> 11:04.739
"put that crap back in the
box and get it in the garage."

11:04.741 --> 11:07.825
[Laughter]

11:07.877 --> 11:11.129
Ghost of Christmas past
here. I got a gift for you.

11:11.164 --> 11:13.047
Oh, my God.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.727
This is what screams Christmas to me.

11:15.596 --> 11:17.703
<i>It's kind of nice to
see the Apes franchise</i>

11:18.005 --> 11:19.463
make a return. You know,

11:19.463 --> 11:21.463
it was a big part of our childhood.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.932
So what's your favorite ape movie.

11:23.967 --> 11:25.550
<i>I'm gonna go with escape
from the planet of the apes.</i>

11:25.602 --> 11:26.551
I'm with you.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.220
- Are you?
- Oh, I love that movie.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.389
I think probably the most dramatic,

11:30.441 --> 11:32.140
strongest of the franchise,

11:32.192 --> 11:35.394
and the most Sci-Fi-Ish,
in as much as they do

11:35.446 --> 11:37.312
travel back through
time, but to our present.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.531
Oh, I love that movie.
What about you, Mike?

11:39.566 --> 11:41.817
<i>I love beneath the planet of the apes.</i>

11:41.869 --> 11:43.702
- Ohh.
- Not the most popular.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.487
- Second in the franchise.
- Yes.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.572
And they change the leading man

11:47.624 --> 11:49.458
right off the top. What about you, ming?

11:49.493 --> 11:51.877
What is your favorite of
the O.G. Ape franchise?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.412
I got to go with the first one.

11:53.464 --> 11:54.830
The first one that started it all.

11:54.832 --> 11:57.382
I thought heston was great.
It had all the iconic lines.

11:57.418 --> 11:58.917
It started off everything.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.669
What about you? Favorite ape movie?

12:00.721 --> 12:03.338
- Mm, Congo.
- [Laughter]

12:03.390 --> 12:06.558
Anytime I get to see apes
committing mass suicide,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.677
like, by jumping in lava, I'm there.

12:08.729 --> 12:12.347
- You like, "Amy sad."
- [Laughter]

12:20.794 --> 12:23.595
Doctor Frankenstein is gonna create

12:23.630 --> 12:25.714
Frankenstein's monster 2.0,

12:25.766 --> 12:28.060
but he only has three corpses to work with.

12:28.204 --> 12:29.570
Let's say they're us.

12:29.622 --> 12:32.707
What part of your body do
you think makes the cut?

12:32.742 --> 12:34.875
All right, well, I mean, I work out.

12:34.911 --> 12:37.411
I got a nice lower body. I got nice glutes.

12:37.413 --> 12:39.163
- [Scoffs]
- I got... what?

12:39.215 --> 12:40.548
- Really?
- Yeah, like,

12:40.583 --> 12:41.590
you know, the glutes.

12:41.764 --> 12:43.838
- It's better than yours.
- It's... it's better

12:43.873 --> 12:44.955
- than mine...
- Yeah.

12:44.957 --> 12:46.841
But I don't know if it's...

12:46.876 --> 12:49.593
Frankenstein worthy. [Laughter]

12:49.629 --> 12:50.845
All right, then where are you going?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.596
- Where's your perfect...
- I mean, come on,

12:52.632 --> 12:54.098
I think it's pretty obvious.

12:54.133 --> 12:57.184
They're only using one part of my body.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.686
I think I'm the brains of the outfit.

12:58.721 --> 13:01.722
He's gonna be a wheelin'
dealin' negotiating machine,

13:01.774 --> 13:03.140
this new monster.

13:03.142 --> 13:05.476
A wheelin' dealin' machine
with a nice ass so far.

13:05.528 --> 13:08.863
[Laughter] That's what we got.

13:08.898 --> 13:10.781
Hey, guys. What's going on?

13:10.817 --> 13:12.116
- Hey, how you doing?
- What's going on?

13:12.151 --> 13:15.202
Ghost of Christmas past
here. I got a gift for you.

13:15.238 --> 13:16.620
Oh, my God!

13:16.656 --> 13:19.724
<i>This is the Rudolph:
The Island of Misfit Toys</i>

13:19.759 --> 13:20.758
action figure collection.

13:29.268 --> 13:30.885
I remember the figures
came out separately,

13:30.920 --> 13:33.304
but I've never seen them in
this kind of display before.

13:33.339 --> 13:35.339
It was a wholesale club exclusive,

13:35.391 --> 13:38.759
whole set, all together, released in 2001.

13:38.811 --> 13:41.178
This is what screams Christmas
to me from my childhood.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.981
It's not a Christmas
tree. It's not Santa Claus.

13:44.016 --> 13:45.399
It's these little Clay creatures.

13:45.435 --> 13:47.401
- It's this little Santa Claus.
- [Laughter]

13:47.437 --> 13:49.019
Well, yeah, it's this Santa claus.

13:49.072 --> 13:50.821
If I missed even
a minute of this...

13:50.857 --> 13:53.324
'cause remember, watching
this back when I was a kid,

13:53.359 --> 13:54.575
- there was no VCRs.
- Yeah.

13:54.610 --> 13:57.361
There was no DVR
where you could rewind it

13:57.363 --> 13:59.864
if you got in late or
had to go to the bathroom.

13:59.866 --> 14:01.832
- Right.
- You had one shot.

14:01.868 --> 14:05.119
If you missed it, Christmas
was basically ruined.

14:05.171 --> 14:06.658
I remember, one year I missed it,

14:06.658 --> 14:08.756
I immediately turned
Jewish right afterwards.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.925
- [Laughter]
- I was like, "what's the point?"

14:10.960 --> 14:13.461
The original must see TV, man.

14:13.513 --> 14:17.014
'Cause kids, we didn't
have instant and streamings

14:17.049 --> 14:18.182
and the "facebookings" and twitters.

14:18.217 --> 14:19.767
[Laughter]

14:19.802 --> 14:21.769
Only had one chance and that was it,

14:21.804 --> 14:23.604
and so you waited, and
when they announced...

14:23.639 --> 14:25.473
<i>like, you'd look through TV guide</i>

14:25.525 --> 14:27.858
<i>as Christmas got closer.
What's TV guide?</i>

14:27.894 --> 14:30.111
Yeah, the kids are like,
"you lost me, old man."

14:30.146 --> 14:31.362
[Laughter] "What's Christmas?"

14:31.397 --> 14:35.649
[Laughter]

14:35.701 --> 14:37.401
I have to ask you,
'cause I can't figure it out

14:37.453 --> 14:38.652
for the life of me.

14:38.704 --> 14:40.454
Why are you bringing it
in here today to sell it?

14:40.490 --> 14:41.739
Gotta start clearing stuff out.

14:41.741 --> 14:43.824
I got this man cave, huge man cave

14:43.876 --> 14:46.043
of shelves and shelves of stuff.

14:46.078 --> 14:48.129
This doesn't have any place?

14:48.164 --> 14:50.164
There is no room for
Christmas in this man cave!

14:50.216 --> 14:51.799
Well, you know, I got the Transformers,

14:51.834 --> 14:53.300
I got the Joes. You
know, '80s, come on, '80s.

14:53.336 --> 14:56.086
Oh, my God, I'm so sick of
that, Transformers and G.I. Joe.

14:56.088 --> 14:58.556
Like, what... what about
this made it so magical?

14:58.591 --> 15:00.841
Like, I like it, but I don't...
I'm not frothing at the mouth.

15:00.893 --> 15:02.810
I don't... if
I miss it, eh.

15:02.845 --> 15:05.513
It's pure bliss in Clay.

15:05.565 --> 15:08.265
It's pre-computers. It's all done by hand.

15:08.317 --> 15:10.568
It's all done with the absolute most...

15:10.603 --> 15:13.437
Attention to detail, love, and care.

15:13.489 --> 15:17.241
This, this is more powerful
than anything that G.I. Joe

15:17.276 --> 15:19.610
ever brought to the screen.
I don't know about that.

15:19.612 --> 15:21.445
Or Transformers. These don't transform

15:21.447 --> 15:22.613
into anything, they just sit there.

15:22.665 --> 15:24.331
They transform a boy into a man!

15:24.367 --> 15:26.534
- Oh, okay.
- [Laughter]

15:26.586 --> 15:27.785
- Can we fire him?
- Yes.

15:27.787 --> 15:29.620
- He... he appreciates nothing.
- [Laughs]

15:29.672 --> 15:31.038
This is the classics, kid.

15:31.090 --> 15:34.008
Stop motion was the original C.G.

15:34.043 --> 15:35.509
- Yeah, but I
- I mean, look at it,

15:35.545 --> 15:37.892
it's so stiff and
just... it's cheesy.

15:37.892 --> 15:39.847
- You're burying yourself.
- It just doesn't look good.

15:39.882 --> 15:41.215
- Just admit it.
- Keep digging.

15:41.267 --> 15:42.592
Go outside after this.

15:42.592 --> 15:43.855
What, are you... fight
him? You're like,

15:44.047 --> 15:45.562
- "oh, let's take this outside."
- [Laughter]

15:45.562 --> 15:47.420
"You like Rudolph!" He's like,
"yeah, yeah, yeah,

15:47.420 --> 15:48.424
there's something special about him."

15:48.464 --> 15:52.610
- Quick, take a picture. Take a picture.
- [Laughter]

15:52.645 --> 15:53.777
Well, obviously, you got me

15:53.813 --> 15:55.029
over a little bit of a barrel here.

15:55.064 --> 15:58.649
You know I love it, so how
much do you want for it?

15:58.701 --> 16:00.651
Thinking 150.

16:00.703 --> 16:04.071
150, wow.

16:04.123 --> 16:05.656
I guess I shouldn't have
said I loved it, huh?

16:05.708 --> 16:07.575
A negotiating machine.

16:07.627 --> 16:09.326
So far we're back to
just having a nice ass...

16:09.378 --> 16:10.461
- [Slapping]
- Hey!

16:10.496 --> 16:11.462
On that monster.

16:11.497 --> 16:13.080
[Laughter]

16:13.132 --> 16:15.966
Would you take 75 for it?

16:16.002 --> 16:19.086
Let's meet in the middle? 90 bucks?

16:19.138 --> 16:22.006
You're on. I think
that's fair, 90 bucks.

16:23.009 --> 16:24.425
- $90.
- Excellent.

16:24.477 --> 16:25.426
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, sir.

16:25.478 --> 16:26.560
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

16:26.596 --> 16:27.728
Are you excited? This is like Christmas

16:27.763 --> 16:29.763
- right now?
- Eh, I'm not gonna lie to you.

16:29.815 --> 16:31.982
I feel like I want to
do some holiday shopping,

16:32.018 --> 16:35.269
decorate some trees, put
some lights on my house.

16:35.321 --> 16:38.105
Yeah, yeah, maybe we could
hang some mistletoe above us.

16:39.442 --> 16:41.358
- [Laughs]
- What is wrong with you?

16:41.410 --> 16:42.526
It's cool with Mike.

16:42.528 --> 16:45.246
[Laughter]

16:45.281 --> 16:46.830
Hey, you guys like superhero battles?

16:46.866 --> 16:48.249
That's the only battles we like.

16:48.284 --> 16:49.667
Got something you
might be interested in.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.201
Wow, man, this is unbelievable.

16:51.203 --> 16:52.202
Where did you get this?

16:58.093 --> 17:00.928
If you guys could take any technology

17:00.980 --> 17:04.231
from any Sci-Hi TV show or movie...

17:04.266 --> 17:05.933
can't use it to benefit yourself,

17:05.984 --> 17:07.483
you've got to use
it to help humanity...

17:07.519 --> 17:09.903
which piece of technology would you take?

17:09.939 --> 17:11.488
I'd use the Tardis to time travel

17:11.522 --> 17:14.241
back to Ford's Theatre,
and I'd save Lincoln,

17:14.276 --> 17:16.693
and I'd kill John Wilkes booth.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.829
Somebody's always going
back in time to kill...

17:18.864 --> 17:20.030
- "I want to kill somebody."
- Yeah,

17:20.082 --> 17:21.365
- they're gonna kill somebody.
- [Laughs]

17:21.416 --> 17:24.034
"I want to go back in
time to Ford's Theatre,

17:24.086 --> 17:26.536
totally stick out like a sore thumb."

17:26.589 --> 17:28.454
Have you ever even shot a
gun? You'd probably miss him.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.207
You'd probably hit Mary Todd Lincoln.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.593
Ohh. How you doing?

17:32.628 --> 17:33.961
Hey, you guys like superhero battles?

17:34.013 --> 17:34.962
- No.
- [Scoffs]

17:35.014 --> 17:36.129
- No?
- That's all we d...

17:36.181 --> 17:37.381
that's the only battles we like.

17:37.433 --> 17:38.799
I got something you
might be interested in.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.717
<i>It's Marvel's greatest
superhero battle book.</i>

17:40.769 --> 17:42.102
- I remember that book, man.
- Great book.

17:42.137 --> 17:43.303
Very fond of it.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.396
So you got some signatures on here, huh?

17:52.448 --> 17:54.648
No way. Is that Jack Kirby's signature?

17:54.650 --> 17:55.949
That is Jack Kirby's signature.

17:55.985 --> 17:57.484
- And Stan Lee?
- Of course.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.820
And John Romita. That's amazing.

17:59.872 --> 18:00.988
- Wow.
- God, man,

18:01.040 --> 18:02.990
this is unbelievable.
Where did you get this?

18:02.992 --> 18:04.241
I got it from my grandfather.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.660
He unfortunately passed
away. He left it to me.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.246
Jack Kirby's signature
on anything is amazing.

18:09.298 --> 18:10.998
- That's pretty big.
- Yeah.

18:11.050 --> 18:14.251
Jack Kirby was the guy, along with Stan,

18:14.303 --> 18:17.054
who created the foundation

18:17.089 --> 18:19.756
for everything that people
are digging on today, right?

18:19.808 --> 18:21.591
That's absolutely true.

18:21.644 --> 18:23.343
<i>The Avengers.
Yeah, he was there.</i>

18:23.345 --> 18:26.346
<i>X-Men, he's the first artist
to ever draw the X-Men.</i>

18:26.348 --> 18:30.400
<i>Fantastic Four, Hulk, I
mean, the list is endless.</i>

18:30.436 --> 18:31.818
You know, there's a reason

18:31.854 --> 18:34.521
nobody will ever call themselves "king"

18:34.523 --> 18:36.106
- other than Jack Kirby, right?
- Mm.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.158
It's true, they call him
Jack "king" Kirby in comics,

18:38.193 --> 18:41.695
and there's been no other,
like, "the new king," or, like,

18:41.747 --> 18:44.364
"he's been gone a while so
how 'bout this guy's now king?"

18:44.366 --> 18:46.249
Nobody's ever replaced him.

18:46.285 --> 18:47.534
I've written comics. I think I'm gonna go

18:47.586 --> 18:49.336
by Bry "the king" Johnson from now on.

18:49.371 --> 18:51.922
[Laughter]

18:51.957 --> 18:53.674
What's your favorite superhero battle?

18:53.709 --> 18:55.592
Has to be Spider-Man versus Punisher, man.

18:55.627 --> 18:57.427
- Really?
- Punisher is my... he's my guy.

18:57.463 --> 19:00.013
I would think that Spider-Man
would mop him up

19:00.049 --> 19:02.299
- ten out of ten times.
- He would,

19:02.351 --> 19:04.935
[laughter] He would.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.803
Do you think that book
lived up to its name?

19:06.855 --> 19:09.106
You're questioning some
of the stories they chose

19:09.141 --> 19:10.640
<i>to be in the greatest battles?
Uh, I remember,</i>

19:10.693 --> 19:12.893
wasn't there, like, a kingpin
versus... I can't remember...

19:12.895 --> 19:14.861
<i>no, it was X-Men versus The Blob.</i>

19:14.897 --> 19:17.397
Is it the same blob from
the Steve McQueen movie?

19:17.449 --> 19:20.450
No, different blob.
The X-Men's villain blob,

19:20.486 --> 19:22.319
whose power is to be fat.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.704
I'm not gonna go by "the king."

19:23.739 --> 19:25.322
[Laughter]

19:25.374 --> 19:26.990
I just thought of a new name for myself.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.709
[Laughter]

19:28.744 --> 19:31.294
- Why you looking to sell it?
- I want to go to film school.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.213
Yeah? Okay, all right.

19:33.248 --> 19:35.215
We may be able to help you out today.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.299
What are you looking to get for it?

19:36.335 --> 19:38.085
About 750.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.005
So you're thinking
about community theater?

19:42.057 --> 19:43.340
[Laughs]

19:43.392 --> 19:45.008
Or maybe just going to see a movie.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.260
[Laughter]

19:47.262 --> 19:50.514
I mean, I could offer you... 300.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.766
- That's a little low for me.
- All right,

19:52.818 --> 19:54.768
how much more?

19:54.820 --> 19:56.353
600?

19:56.405 --> 19:59.022
I know it's still asking a lot.
Yeah, It is.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.109
I could do 350.

20:02.161 --> 20:05.278
450?

20:05.280 --> 20:07.948
- You can't do 450.
- Yeah, it's still more than...

20:07.950 --> 20:10.083
it's still more than I
think the book is worth.

20:10.119 --> 20:12.536
I think 350 is the best I can do today.

20:12.588 --> 20:15.038
- I'm gonna have to remain...
- Firm on that?

20:15.090 --> 20:17.541
- Steadfast on that one.
- That's a little low for me.

20:17.593 --> 20:18.625
- All right, man, well...
- Thank you, man.

20:18.677 --> 20:19.626
Good luck with the film career, man.

20:19.678 --> 20:20.794
Thank you, man. All right.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.679
- Nice meeting you guys.
- All right.

20:22.714 --> 20:24.264
Damn.

20:24.299 --> 20:26.016
- Jack Kirby, though, man.
- I know.

20:26.051 --> 20:28.301
- Kills you to let it go.
- Sure does.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.303
Does it ever bother
you that your staff spends

20:30.355 --> 20:32.522
half their time in, like, a daze

20:32.558 --> 20:34.057
and need to regain their senses

20:34.109 --> 20:35.859
just because a comic book came in?

20:35.894 --> 20:37.894
- [Laughter]
- I would be disappointed

20:37.946 --> 20:39.696
if they didn't behave that way.

20:39.731 --> 20:42.115
I know, like, six
knees buckling at once.

20:42.151 --> 20:43.650
[Laughter]

20:43.702 --> 20:45.152
Oh, your knees buckled too, buddy.

20:45.154 --> 20:46.703
- I'm fat, my...
- [Laughter]

20:46.738 --> 20:49.539
My knees can't handle my carriage.

20:49.575 --> 20:51.408
Oh, man! And that's gonna wrap it up

20:51.460 --> 20:53.210
for another edition of Comic Book Men.

20:53.245 --> 20:55.152
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

20:55.319 --> 20:56.621
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

20:56.792 --> 20:57.626
Ming Chen.

20:57.626 --> 21:01.327
Remember kids always keep your *

21:01.495 --> 21:02.140
Good night.

21:02.313 --> 21:04.428
