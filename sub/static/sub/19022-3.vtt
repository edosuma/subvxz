00:00.057 --> 00:01.891
Previously on "Six"...

00:02.872 --> 00:05.772
24 hours ago, armed men
assaulted a girls' school.

00:05.774 --> 00:07.341
Hostages were taken.

00:07.343 --> 00:08.910
They also captured Richard Taggart,

00:08.943 --> 00:11.078
former troop chief of this command.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.013
HVT is Ebo Buhari.

00:13.015 --> 00:14.181
He knows where Rip is.

00:14.183 --> 00:15.682
We get in, we get out,

00:15.684 --> 00:17.184
we ask for forgiveness later.

00:17.186 --> 00:19.386
- Don't shoot.
- Who's this man?

00:19.388 --> 00:21.255
That's the man who killed my brother.

00:21.257 --> 00:22.289
No. No. No!

00:22.291 --> 00:24.057
- I want him.
- _

00:24.059 --> 00:27.628
It's taken care of. I'm
going to get the SEAL.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.363
He's a distraction from your mission.

00:29.365 --> 00:31.365
This is Boko Haram we're talking about.

00:31.367 --> 00:33.767
They're gonna wrap this guy
in Goodyears and torch him.

00:33.769 --> 00:34.846
Special soldier!

00:34.871 --> 00:36.937
Those men outside... They saw you on TV.

00:36.939 --> 00:38.705
They said you had special skills.

00:38.707 --> 00:40.474
I can't help you.

00:41.877 --> 00:44.578
You are Navy SEAL. Special Forces.

00:44.580 --> 00:47.915
Navy... SEAL.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.250
I'm a Navy mother... SEAL.

00:53.722 --> 00:56.757
No, no!

00:58.127 --> 00:59.593
Get off of me!

00:59.595 --> 01:00.928
No!

01:00.930 --> 01:03.330
Help! Please! Please don't!

Stop. Stop.

01:42.196 --> 01:44.698

01:45.221 --> 01:46.899
_

02:13.126 --> 02:15.439
_

02:31.520 --> 02:33.755
This way! Put her in the truck!

03:22.905 --> 03:25.405
Come with me, Navy SEAL.

03:42.891 --> 03:44.458
Look, America.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.326
Your crusader warriors are weak.

03:46.328 --> 03:48.228
They believe in false gods.

03:48.230 --> 03:51.665
We will fight to death until
only the Qur'an rules the world.

03:51.667 --> 03:54.234
You will see our strength.

03:54.236 --> 03:57.304
You will feel the steel of our blades.

03:57.306 --> 04:00.741
If we do not get $10
million in one week,

04:00.743 --> 04:02.743
I will cut his head off.

04:44.353 --> 04:45.987
Redline! Redline!

04:48.457 --> 04:51.292
Come on. Come on.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.666
Get up on all fours.

05:01.691 --> 05:02.791
Yeah.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.474
Mind over body.

05:07.476 --> 05:08.643
Yeah.

05:13.415 --> 05:15.483
Mind over body.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.228
He needs a doctor.

05:28.230 --> 05:31.531
Shh, shh, shh. Be quiet.

05:31.533 --> 05:33.201
It's just a truck.

05:34.436 --> 05:37.404
With an oil tank,

05:37.406 --> 05:40.874
which means there's a
refinery somewhere nearby.

05:40.876 --> 05:44.044
They have private guards,

05:44.046 --> 05:47.113
communication.

05:47.115 --> 05:50.884
I'm gonna die here.

05:50.886 --> 05:52.887
You're not gonna die.

05:54.831 --> 05:57.065
Just focus on your breathing.

05:58.417 --> 06:01.479
Just focus on your breathing.

06:01.504 --> 06:03.630
What's the gouge today?

06:03.632 --> 06:05.632
Spooks are here, so whatever
it is, it's gonna suck.

06:05.634 --> 06:07.100
Did you give it a name yet, Ghetto?

06:07.102 --> 06:09.536
- Yeah. Buckley.
- Good one.

06:09.538 --> 06:12.539
"Ghetto"? Is that the best
you come up with is Ghetto?

06:12.541 --> 06:14.241
- It's better than "Fishbait."
- Yeah, yeah.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.710
- They think I'm an Eskimo.
- From Alaska?

06:16.712 --> 06:18.778
Really? Afghanistan, bro.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.580
Sit down.

06:20.582 --> 06:22.582
- What's going on with Rip, sir?
- Have a seat.

06:22.584 --> 06:25.252
Dubai first, Lieutenant.

06:25.254 --> 06:28.788
The death toll from the
Dubai bombings is now 210.

06:28.790 --> 06:31.491
The flag design appears to
be from the Umayyad Caliphate.

06:31.493 --> 06:33.660
All signs indicate this
is the new Jihadi group

06:33.662 --> 06:35.829
that carried out the
Tanzania embassy attack.

06:35.831 --> 06:38.331
The explosives match, so does the M.O.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.900
What about Rip?

06:39.902 --> 06:41.601
We get anything out of
the courier from the ship?

06:41.603 --> 06:42.936
We're working on it.

06:42.938 --> 06:45.305
What he's told us points to this region.

06:45.307 --> 06:47.908
There are some small
refineries in the area,

06:47.910 --> 06:49.843
which is a new zone of BH activity.

06:49.845 --> 06:52.412
Show them the video, Lieutenant.

06:52.414 --> 06:55.015
Look, America.

06:55.017 --> 06:58.418
Your crusader warriors are weak.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.687
They believe in false gods.

07:00.689 --> 07:03.990
We will fight to death until
only the Qur'an rules the world.

07:03.992 --> 07:06.760
You will see our strength.

07:06.762 --> 07:08.929
You will feel the steel of our blades.

07:08.931 --> 07:11.331
- We need to get in there, sir.
- Joe, take it easy.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.100
We have every available
intelligence asset on it.

07:14.102 --> 07:16.002
Now, we'll get one swing at this,

07:16.004 --> 07:18.705
so we let the intel above us develop it.

07:18.707 --> 07:19.941
Yes, sir.

07:23.545 --> 07:25.646
Take that down.

07:35.023 --> 07:37.057
What are you drawing?

07:37.059 --> 07:38.292
My bird.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.062
Would you draw something for me?

07:42.064 --> 07:44.498
What?

08:00.406 --> 08:03.316
Cover your head.

08:03.318 --> 08:04.863
Whore.

08:47.942 --> 08:50.509
Okay, the next evolution
is gear exchange.

08:51.605 --> 08:55.774
There will be one air
source for two people.

08:55.776 --> 08:58.643
You will swap equipment
in a precise order

08:58.645 --> 09:00.312
with your mask blacked out.

09:00.314 --> 09:02.881
So stay in physical contact.

09:02.883 --> 09:05.957
You panic, if you lose
touch, your buddy might die.

09:11.892 --> 09:13.788
- Jesus, Graves! Forget someone?
- Where'd you go? Huh?

09:13.812 --> 09:15.446
You panicked. You flipped
the thing the wrong way.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.562
Shut up!

09:17.564 --> 09:19.265
Hey. Hey!

09:20.233 --> 09:21.900
Doesn't matter whose fault it is.

09:21.902 --> 09:24.002
Just work the problem
that's in front of you.

09:24.004 --> 09:26.513
Deal with your fear by
focusing on the here and now.

09:26.538 --> 09:28.640
- We are.
- Yeah, instead of focusing on your body

09:28.642 --> 09:30.176
- floating up in an estu...
- Hey!

09:32.422 --> 09:33.988
Graves, you good?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.557
- Easy day.
- Every day is an easy day.

09:36.559 --> 09:37.826
- Hoo-yah.
- Okay.

09:38.728 --> 09:40.428
Not you.

09:40.430 --> 09:42.597
Pull that shit one more time.

09:42.599 --> 09:44.164
Put doubt in a teammate's mind,

09:44.189 --> 09:46.467
and see if I don't ride you
out of this goddamn program.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.903
- Yes, Instructor.
- You understand me?

09:48.905 --> 09:50.671
Yes, Instructor Taggart.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.341
Go!

10:21.170 --> 10:22.904
Hey, Esther.

10:24.423 --> 10:27.576
Esther, come here. Come here.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.452
When they take you to the bathroom,

10:38.454 --> 10:40.655
where do they take you?

10:40.657 --> 10:43.357
A hole in the ground. It's dirty.

10:43.359 --> 10:45.993
Can you see a road?

10:45.995 --> 10:48.562
I want you to ask to go again.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.031
Leave the girl alone.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.500
You want to go home, right?

10:52.502 --> 10:55.169
You want to feed your
bird? What's her name?

10:55.171 --> 10:57.338
His... Sama.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.140
It means "sky" in Hausa.

10:59.142 --> 11:00.975
It's beautiful. Sama.

11:00.977 --> 11:02.576
Well, if you will help me,

11:02.578 --> 11:04.845
I promise you'll see Sama again, okay?

11:04.847 --> 11:06.414
Ask to go to the bathroom,

11:06.416 --> 11:09.150
and I want you to look
for a fire on the horizon,

11:09.152 --> 11:10.818
a black smoke.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.253
I want you to remember where that is

11:12.255 --> 11:13.854
when you walk back here, okay?

11:13.856 --> 11:16.358
Esther. Come here.

11:23.399 --> 11:26.067
Na'omi, what happened
to you doesn't matter.

11:26.069 --> 11:27.860
Nobody's gonna think less of you.

11:27.885 --> 11:29.417
I don't need your pity.

11:29.442 --> 11:32.239
She'll never marry now.
No man will touch her.

11:32.241 --> 11:34.208
She wasn't modest. They
defiled her because of...

11:34.210 --> 11:36.077
Because I am a woman, and I won't cover

11:36.079 --> 11:37.620
my face for any man or god.

11:37.645 --> 11:39.547
You should not have
taught Western pollution.

11:39.549 --> 11:41.348
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:41.350 --> 11:43.184
As soon as I find out
where this refinery is,

11:43.186 --> 11:44.952
I'll slip out at night.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.220
I'll come back for all of you

11:46.222 --> 11:47.588
before they even know that I'm gone.

11:47.590 --> 11:49.066
Oh, you're full of shit.

11:49.091 --> 11:51.952
You won't come back for us.
You'll just leave us here to rot.

11:52.822 --> 11:54.022
Na'omi?

11:56.317 --> 11:58.766
- What are you doing? What
are you doing? Hey! - Hey!

11:58.768 --> 12:00.634
- Hey, man, what are you doing?!
- Hey, sir, hey!

12:00.636 --> 12:03.672
What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:04.149 --> 12:05.262
_

12:05.287 --> 12:07.004
_

12:07.390 --> 12:08.655
_

12:08.943 --> 12:10.523
_

12:10.759 --> 12:13.782
_

12:16.953 --> 12:19.920
Navy SEAL wants to bring help, yes?

12:22.425 --> 12:24.841
This is the help you bring.

13:24.816 --> 13:27.250
Esther.

13:27.252 --> 13:28.719
Esther.

13:34.459 --> 13:36.493
I saw black smoke.

13:36.495 --> 13:38.194
Where?

13:38.196 --> 13:39.629
Good job.

13:39.631 --> 13:42.665
Good job, Esther. Loosen my hands.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.335
Na'omi, I-I need your help.

13:45.337 --> 13:48.304
I need you to make eye
contact with that guard.

13:48.306 --> 13:50.340
I need you to make him
think that you like him.

13:50.342 --> 13:52.208
- No!
- Think of the girls.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.844
Esther could be next, trust me.

13:54.846 --> 13:57.047
Why trust you?

13:57.049 --> 14:00.850
You're a mercenary.

14:04.890 --> 14:06.489
Budda!

14:06.491 --> 14:08.058
Roger that, Viper Three Three.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.326
Moving to secondary extract point now.

14:10.328 --> 14:12.629
- Open!
- Caulder.

14:12.631 --> 14:14.164
Move!

14:29.009 --> 14:30.443
On me!

14:33.251 --> 14:35.385
Delta One, Viper Three Three.

14:35.387 --> 14:36.920
You have four to six hostiles

14:36.922 --> 14:39.957
moving north IVO Buildings 1 and 2.

14:45.564 --> 14:47.831
Caulder, move. Move.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.065
Move, move.

15:01.675 --> 15:03.276
No.

15:07.919 --> 15:09.919
Delta One, hostiles continue

15:09.921 --> 15:12.922
to push your direction from the north.

15:12.924 --> 15:15.225
Banshee Two Two, request fire mission.

15:15.227 --> 15:18.996
Troops in the open 200 meters
north, marked by IR laser. Over.

15:27.659 --> 15:29.626
Delta One, this is Banshee Two Two.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.862
Tally your mark. Rolling
in from the south.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.330
Get your heads down.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.198
Banshee Two Two, roger.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.434
Isn't this beautiful, boys?

16:41.099 --> 16:44.801
You lost your cherry,
Caulder. How does it feel?

16:44.803 --> 16:47.204
Amazing.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.773
Like Old Testament amazing.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.075
Yeah.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.110
Yeah, we get to break
all Ten Commandments

16:54.112 --> 16:55.260
and get away with it.

16:55.285 --> 16:57.113
Well, that's because God's on our side.

16:57.115 --> 16:58.516
Amen, brother.

17:01.820 --> 17:07.223
You know, at first,
it's like a video game...

17:07.226 --> 17:10.460
"Call of Duty" shit.

17:10.462 --> 17:13.262
Then you realize those
Hajjis shoot back.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.766
You get even better at
pulling that trigger.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.638
Hard part is learning when not to shoot,

17:22.641 --> 17:24.742
like that unarmed kid back there.

17:29.147 --> 17:32.082
Just be careful of guys who can't...

17:32.084 --> 17:34.785
or won't tell the difference.

18:01.965 --> 18:03.684
_

18:03.851 --> 18:06.067
_

18:06.092 --> 18:07.412
_

18:08.049 --> 18:09.639
_

18:15.305 --> 18:18.140
Eat, SEAL.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.407
Save it for them.

18:34.889 --> 18:37.457
Thank you.

18:42.029 --> 18:46.433
Tell me about your family.

18:51.572 --> 18:55.040
My mother was a teacher

18:55.042 --> 18:58.344
in Lagos for the Lycée.

18:58.346 --> 19:02.081
My father worked for the Foreign Office.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.751
They sent me to London for school.

19:05.753 --> 19:09.232
They wanted me to stay, but...

19:09.257 --> 19:12.057
I wanted to help my people.

19:12.059 --> 19:16.195
They will say I brought
shame on my family,

19:16.197 --> 19:19.031
just like the girls.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.601
You were raped by Boko Haram, Na'omi.

19:22.603 --> 19:24.970
My father will say
I should've married...

19:24.972 --> 19:27.273
Been under a man's protection.

19:27.275 --> 19:29.875
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.478
I could never understand that.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.215
What is your name?

19:36.217 --> 19:38.652
Rip.

19:41.389 --> 19:45.090
Richard... Taggart.

19:49.124 --> 19:52.559
Do you have a wife, children?

19:55.469 --> 19:58.137
I had a wife.

19:58.139 --> 20:00.839
What happened?

20:03.778 --> 20:05.944
Three places I could bone her, right?

20:05.946 --> 20:07.513
- A passenger.
- That was so bad!

20:07.515 --> 20:08.981
Maybe an airplane.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.685
Ah, ah, ah. That's on me.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.256
- Go.
- You okay?

20:17.258 --> 20:19.858
Oh, man.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.126
Oh, look at him. He's going for it.

20:21.128 --> 20:23.629
Ah!

21:55.890 --> 21:58.191
It's... It's a back brace.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.471
Bear, let's go.

22:19.914 --> 22:22.815
All right, bye. Later.

23:47.668 --> 23:49.234
Hey.

23:49.236 --> 23:52.137
Bear.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.641
What's up?

23:58.879 --> 24:01.313
Woman on that last target.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.616
What about her?

24:06.605 --> 24:07.872
Well, uh...

24:10.804 --> 24:13.239
she wasn't wearing a suicide vest.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.096
How are we supposed to know that?

24:19.575 --> 24:22.701
She ran towards us.

24:22.703 --> 24:25.003
We're aliens to these people, Joe.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.872
You don't run towards aliens

24:27.897 --> 24:30.108
with four eyes and an exoskeleton

24:30.110 --> 24:32.011
that drop out of the sky, okay?

24:36.250 --> 24:38.083
Some day, you'll have responsibility

24:38.085 --> 24:40.586
for your own team.

24:40.588 --> 24:42.322
Err on the side of bringing them home.

24:59.073 --> 25:01.074
You just bury it.

25:02.524 --> 25:03.858
Bury it.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.054
Bury all of it.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.751
Chido.

25:45.194 --> 25:46.555
_

25:49.429 --> 25:50.713
_

26:10.565 --> 26:12.844
Esther, Esther, Esther, come here.

26:12.846 --> 26:15.381
Come here. Untie me.

26:25.959 --> 26:29.095
Come on. Come on. Come on.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.588
- Get back inside.
- Take the girls with you.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.889
I can't. They'll slow me down.

26:57.891 --> 27:00.359
We are not going back inside that cell.

27:14.541 --> 27:17.008
Are you crazy? They're gonna kill us.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.745
I'm worth $10 million. They'll kill you.

27:45.825 --> 27:48.833
Are you serious?

27:50.670 --> 27:54.238
Lena's Lena's home.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.140
She's praying to the porcelain goddess.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.075
- Ah.
- Oh, yeah, she is.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.244
- Lena's sick?
- God!

28:00.246 --> 28:02.313
Why do pretty people
got to be so stupid?

28:02.315 --> 28:04.636
No, dumbass.

28:04.661 --> 28:10.064
Bear is going to be a daddy.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.422
- Yes.
- All right, Bear.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.891
- Oh.
- I tried to talk him out of it.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.093
Big Bear, big daddy.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.029
There goes your sex life.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.330
- Hey.
- What?

28:19.332 --> 28:22.867
- Hey, equipment check. Now.
- Yeah.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.202
Did you name him yet? Don't
leave home without him.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.271
- Mr. Wonderful.
- Oh, how original.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.206
Tammi and I had a threesome
with him the other night.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.608
Oh, you better be careful with that.

28:30.610 --> 28:31.776
She might leave you for him.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.711
Not a chance.

28:33.713 --> 28:38.416
Every woman wants a man
who doesn't talk back.

28:38.418 --> 28:41.452
- I can see that.
- Why do you think I'm still married, bro?

28:41.454 --> 28:43.421
I wouldn't talk back to Jackie.

28:45.191 --> 28:49.193
You never talk back to Jackie!

28:49.195 --> 28:50.127
Whoo!

28:50.129 --> 28:52.363
- To Lena.
- And Joe.

28:52.365 --> 28:55.000
- To Lena and Joe!
- To Lena and Joe!

28:59.072 --> 29:01.472
Now, how come you and Rip
never had kids, Gloria.

29:01.474 --> 29:02.808
Are you kidding me?

29:04.110 --> 29:07.445
He's got teenage boys already.

29:07.447 --> 29:10.247
It's all dick jokes and barhopping.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.484
So the camel says to the elephant,

29:13.486 --> 29:15.086
"What are you laughing at?

29:15.088 --> 29:17.822
You're the one with
a dick on your face!"

29:17.824 --> 29:20.358
Boom!

29:27.667 --> 29:29.501
Whoa, whoa.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.071
- You okay there, amigo?
- Oh.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.507
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:36.509 --> 29:39.467
I just need another beer, Amigo.

29:45.651 --> 29:50.521
His... His strings are vibrating, man.

29:50.523 --> 29:53.124
His st... His strings
are vibrating, man.

29:53.126 --> 29:56.160
All right, I'll speak to him, all right?

29:56.162 --> 29:57.795
Hey, hey, no, no, no, hey. Come on, now.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.296
- Let me talk to him.
- Leave him alone.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.265
Hey, I've seen this a hundred times.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.634
Once we get in-country,
his static will go away.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.469
- All right? All right.
- All right.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.104
He's good. He's good.

30:07.106 --> 30:10.474
Okay, so, next joke.

30:31.343 --> 30:32.743
Rip.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.702
It's time.

30:38.704 --> 30:41.805
You know, the rules...

30:41.807 --> 30:46.377
say no booze over there, but...

30:46.402 --> 30:49.056
I let my men drink.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.018
I figure...

30:55.988 --> 30:57.923
...what's it matter?

31:02.361 --> 31:06.263
Live and let live.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.633
That's what I say.

31:11.975 --> 31:13.843
Live and let live.

31:52.536 --> 31:55.045
The courier gave up Rip's and
the other hostages' location.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.281
- And how solid is that?
- Just let her do the briefing.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.650
Look, all I'm saying is you
torture Santa Claus long enough,

31:59.652 --> 32:00.985
he'd admit to being Al-Qaeda.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.620
- Do we have any imagery?
- No.

32:02.622 --> 32:04.255
All we know is that the hostages

32:04.257 --> 32:06.457
are approximately 120
kilometers east of Lagos,

32:06.459 --> 32:08.592
just north of Okomu National Park.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.328
A Predator just checked
on station over the area.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.464
Problem is the canopy is thick.

32:13.466 --> 32:15.099
How big is that search area?

32:15.101 --> 32:16.567
800 square miles.

32:16.569 --> 32:19.003
- Damn, he's screwed.
- All heavily forested.

32:19.005 --> 32:21.472
It's like finding flea
shit in a bag of pepper.

32:21.474 --> 32:24.842
Size of the whole damn park.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.179
Hold up. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.514
Hang on, hang on.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.067
Hey!

32:51.470 --> 32:53.604
On your feet.

32:53.606 --> 32:55.172
Esther, stand up.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.441
Stand up now.

32:58.311 --> 32:59.843
Everybody, stand up.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.646
Stand up.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.783
Raise your hands.

33:05.785 --> 33:08.486
All right, everybody, raise your hands.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.132
Chido!

33:33.713 --> 33:36.580
- Let's get to the road! Now!
- What if there's more of them?

33:36.582 --> 33:39.550
- Girls, come on.
- Come on!

33:39.552 --> 33:40.851
Come on.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.653
We don't stand a chance!

33:42.655 --> 33:44.254
They won't shoot us if we give up!

33:44.256 --> 33:46.523
We don't have choice. We
don't have a choice! Come on!

33:54.597 --> 33:56.722
_

34:02.356 --> 34:04.423
You could have just used the game.

34:04.425 --> 34:06.592
Save some aviation fuel.

34:06.594 --> 34:08.694
Sometimes it's important to look the men

34:08.696 --> 34:11.530
under your command in the eye...

34:11.554 --> 34:15.178
to build trust and respect.

34:15.203 --> 34:17.268
Of course, Emir Muttaqi.

34:17.271 --> 34:18.572
Insha'Allah.

34:19.974 --> 34:24.076
Michael... we've all lost loved ones

34:24.078 --> 34:25.777
to the Americans in this war.

34:25.803 --> 34:28.757
We're all burning with
the holy fire of vengeance,

34:28.783 --> 34:31.650
but I don't want this SEAL
to distract you from our goal.

34:31.652 --> 34:34.920
We can use him for the cause.

34:34.922 --> 34:36.590
It's risky.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.926
Remember, Michael, the
words of the prophet,

34:40.928 --> 34:42.628
"Alayhi as-salam"...

34:42.630 --> 34:45.264
"The world is just a moment,

34:45.266 --> 34:47.967
so make it a moment of obedience."

34:47.969 --> 34:50.636
Of course.

34:50.638 --> 34:52.938
I owe everything to you.

34:57.645 --> 34:59.645
Take the plane.

34:59.647 --> 35:02.248
There are some Saudis
here I need to see.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.649
Thank you.

35:03.651 --> 35:05.585
- I'll be careful.
- I know.

35:13.628 --> 35:16.795
I'm clean.

35:16.797 --> 35:19.865
I told you, I've been
clean for six months.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.968
The Prince insists.

35:22.970 --> 35:25.271
Leave the sample with Sahid.

35:25.273 --> 35:27.941
As-salaam alaikum.

35:31.479 --> 35:33.813
Wa'alaikum salaam.

35:41.957 --> 35:44.110
_

35:44.155 --> 35:46.723
_

36:14.855 --> 36:16.489
Erase that shit.

36:18.226 --> 36:21.161
We need it for the shooter statements.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.831
I said erase it.

36:29.818 --> 36:31.753
Hey, yo!

36:34.775 --> 36:38.210
Buckley, Fishbait, out.

36:38.212 --> 36:39.679
Get out now!

36:51.892 --> 36:54.060
Give me the camera, Caulder.

36:56.271 --> 36:58.364
Give me that Goddamn camera.

36:58.366 --> 37:01.867
All the shit you said to us,
everything, you betrayed it all.

37:01.869 --> 37:03.902
He was a traitor. He was a terrorist.

37:03.904 --> 37:05.738
He'd be back in one week.
He'd kill more of us.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.106
He was an unarmed
American who surrendered.

37:07.108 --> 37:09.441
Just deal with it, Caulder. This is war.

37:09.443 --> 37:11.310
And we are warriors!

37:11.335 --> 37:13.356
Remember?!

37:13.381 --> 37:14.952
Not savages!

37:14.977 --> 37:16.949
- Okay.
- We have rules.

37:16.951 --> 37:18.417
- If we didn't have rules...
- We're done here.

37:18.419 --> 37:19.885
...we'd be no better
than the... ragheads!

37:19.887 --> 37:21.820
- We're done here.
- Hey!

37:21.822 --> 37:23.523
Hey, wait.

37:24.911 --> 37:27.626
Who the fuck are you, man?

37:27.628 --> 37:31.830
Do you even remember what you
said to me... about killing?

37:31.832 --> 37:34.333
"The hardest lesson to learn

37:34.335 --> 37:37.569
is when not to pull the trigger."

37:37.571 --> 37:39.605
You said watch out for the guy

37:39.607 --> 37:41.708
who can't tell the difference.

37:45.012 --> 37:48.113
I made the call.

37:48.115 --> 37:50.417
And I'd make the call again.

37:52.050 --> 37:54.051
Can you tell the difference anymore?

38:00.695 --> 38:02.062
Bear?

38:12.039 --> 38:14.606
I don't have a problem.

38:14.608 --> 38:16.643
Amigo?

38:19.780 --> 38:22.649
Maybe you shouldn't have shot that guy.

38:24.518 --> 38:27.453
But we're a team, and
no one is saying shit.

38:27.455 --> 38:29.322
- That's right.
- Okay?

38:32.960 --> 38:34.828
I won't do another Op with you ever.

38:52.546 --> 38:54.347
Fuck it.

39:03.858 --> 39:05.158
Erase it.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.846
Come on.

39:27.848 --> 39:29.915
Come on. This way. Come on.

39:29.917 --> 39:33.051
Come on. Come on, everybody.

39:33.053 --> 39:35.888
Come on. Come on. Come on.

39:38.392 --> 39:40.192
Hurry.

39:40.194 --> 39:43.195
Hurry! Hide!

39:43.197 --> 39:45.030
Come on!

39:50.137 --> 39:51.470
Run!

39:51.472 --> 39:54.106
Come on, run. Run! Come on!

39:54.108 --> 39:55.475
Come on. Come on.

40:27.074 --> 40:29.075
Come on.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.848
Let's go, let's go!

40:38.519 --> 40:40.787
Ow, ow!

40:41.822 --> 40:44.022
Save the girls. Go!

40:44.024 --> 40:45.290
Run!

40:45.292 --> 40:47.192
Hurry!

40:47.194 --> 40:48.293
Come on!

40:53.200 --> 40:54.567
Richard!

40:56.704 --> 40:58.470
Run!

41:02.376 --> 41:03.475
Esther!

41:10.651 --> 41:12.018
Esther!

41:15.956 --> 41:17.856
Esther! Esther!

41:17.858 --> 41:20.893
No, no!

41:24.798 --> 41:26.266
Esther!

41:32.640 --> 41:34.406
Okay!

42:01.001 --> 42:02.936
Put the weapon down.
