01:42.800 --> 01:44.597
Jerome, what are you doing?

01:45.480 --> 01:46.754
Every inch counts, Nathan.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.276
These are supposed to help make me
grow taller in seven to 1 0 days.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.154
Come on, J.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.232
You know those things are a scam,
just like your ankle weights.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.675
I don't know, man.
It says they're guaranteed.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.671
Jerome, do you think
I could try them on?

02:01.840 --> 02:05.116
Come on, Rod. You already
have permanent ankle weights.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.628
Yo, Rod, I'm in my spot.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.873
Money in the bank, baby.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.157
And that's why it's called
the bank shot.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.718
Yeah? Then try hitting it
from somewhere else on the court.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.717
Why fix it if it ain't broken?

02:36.720 --> 02:38.915
Come on. Not the humming again.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.553
It's good luck.
I can't make the shot if I don't hum.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.833
Oh, come on, J.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.991
Those aren't gonna
make you jump any higher.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.195
How do you know?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.351
Nothing will make you
play better overnight.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.273
Watch, man. One day,
I'm gonna be known as Air Jerome.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.799
You're gonna have to hit
over 50 percent from the field...

03:08.960 --> 03:10.393
...if you wanna be like Mike.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.790
Not to mention grow another two feet.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.758
That's what I'm trying to do.
Now, check it out.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.679
Isn't this cute? Now, step off.
Some real talent's taking the court.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.877
-But we were here first.
-And that should mean something to me?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.713
-lt should, brainless.
-What'd you call me?

03:30.760 --> 03:34.799
-Maybe we should just go, Jerome.
-Let's play them for the court.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.635
-That's Double J's son.
-Yeah? You're the choker's kid, huh?

03:38.800 --> 03:41.678
His name's Double J, and he's one
of the kings from this court.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.150
Yeah, like a million years ago,
before he blew his chances of going pro.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.153
-Now he's just a choker.
-Don't call him that. Take it back.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.869
No, I'm gonna take it out instead.
Let's play for the court, first to 1 1.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.918
You win, you're in.
You lose, you cruise.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.550
Cool. I got you.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.552
-This is suicide.
-No, guys.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.119
Man, listen, we can do this.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.475
You stay close to the basket
for that bank shot.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.315
You keep setting those beautiful picks.
These guys aren't as good as they think.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.630
And if we lose,
at least we lose with style.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.836
"Triple Threat" on three.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.468
One, two, three, Triple Threat!

04:16.640 --> 04:18.232
Are you cheerleaders ready or what?

04:26.160 --> 04:29.755
I don't know if you noticed or not,
but the ball's supposed to go in the hoop.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.558
Just shut up and play, shorty.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.431
-Shoot it!
-No.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.119
What are you doing? You had it.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.554
I wasn't in my spot.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.991
-Sorry.
-It's not how you start the game...

04:43.160 --> 04:44.991
...it's how you finish it. Come on.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.278
Come on, Mariah Carey. Take the shot.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.359
Get that out of here!

05:01.360 --> 05:04.352
Yo, Ray. Is that Lydia
and Double J's kid?

05:08.160 --> 05:09.149
Nice.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.349
Like father, like son. Come on, man.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.275
That's game, and that's funny.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.630
-Yo, that's messed up.
-Nice kicks, my man.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.711
Yeah, they got air conditioning.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.676
He's your little cousin, man.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.388
Bye-bye.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.550
One day, I'm gonna show
them who runs this court.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.995
Man, don't even worry about it, J.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.717
-I got you. I got you.
-What, what? Get out of my way.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.598
Oh, yeah. That's game, homey.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.749
Charge, man!

05:53.920 --> 05:56.639
No, you can't call charge
in no streetball game, all right?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.433
-Thanks, man.
-I'm not trying to help you. Pay up.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.029
Thanks for the money.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.760
I can buy your mama something nice.
Good game. See you.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.353
I know why we lost.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.909
I wasn't wearing
my lucky underwear today.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.310
Yeah, that must've been it.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.956
Man, one day we're gonna win
this tournament.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.509
Yeah, and one day
I'm gonna be BeyoncÃ©'s boyfriend.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.989
-Let's see which one happens first.
-Come on, Nate.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.515
You know my dad won that tournament
back in '89.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.798
His name is on the Ball of Fame with all
the greats that came off these courts.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.475
-I wouldn't call any of us great players.
-That's why we need to practice.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.517
So we can get good enough to win...

06:34.680 --> 06:36.591
...and get our names up there
next to his.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.196
Then what? You think if you do this,
your dad will hang out with you more?

06:40.360 --> 06:42.112
I don't know. It couldn't hurt.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.113
Everyone around here thinks
my dad is the choker.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.271
I want them to think about
something else...

06:49.440 --> 06:51.431
...when they hear the name
Jerome Jenkins.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.276
Come on, J. Let's bounce.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.592
Hey, guys.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.320
The Game On Open Run is tomorrow.
We should check it out.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.714
-Yeah.
-Definitely.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.430
-Meet me at the little court, 9 a.m.?
-Nine a.m.?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.910
-The game doesn't start until 1 1.
-This way we can get our practice in.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.958
Come on, J. It's summer break.
Plus, I need my beauty sleep.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.429
Yeah, and he needs
every minute he can get.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.559
Besides, J, you keep promising this is
gonna happen and that's gonna happen.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.711
Know what? Nothing ever happens.

07:24.280 --> 07:25.952
Not yet.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.190
Just gotta have a little faith.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.912
My Cheetos! Come on, now.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.640
Oh, you're always taking
something from a brother.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.472
Cheetos. I'm hungry.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.632
Ray, I just need to get through
grading these exams, okay?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.678
Aunt Lydia, you know I can't
watch the game without my Cheetos.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.558
It's the playoffs.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.920
-Man!
-Well, there's rice cakes in the pantry.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.672
Rice cakes? Damn.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.874
Oh, I know who got it.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.160
Hey, Jerome! I know you in there.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.471
Jerome, you eat my Cheetos?

08:11.480 --> 08:13.914
Look at your-- Oh, man!

08:22.280 --> 08:26.068
Jerome Jenkins, what did I tell you
about taking things that aren't yours?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.549
I'm sorry. I didn't know they were his.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.951
Are you all packed for the weekend?
Your father should be here soon.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.634
-Yeah, what time's he coming?
-Any minute.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.677
Why don't you come downstairs.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.717
-Can I finish the game first?
-All right.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.952
But in the future, just make sure
you ask before you take, okay?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.519
-Okay.
-Okay?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.838
Okay.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.549
Nice pass, Mom. Jenkins puts it up...

08:53.800 --> 08:55.119
...and misses again.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.834
It's showtime.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.830
Oh, it's off the rim.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.718
Sorry about your Cheetos, Cousin Ray.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.156
You just better be glad
I had an extra bag in my car.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.356
You lose any money
out on the court today?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.475
Well, no. I was just playing for fun.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.551
Doesn't look like you was
having fun to me.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.995
-I just had an off day.
-Look, man, stop fronting.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.639
You can't play a player, son.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.597
Now, look, if you want me to...

09:25.760 --> 09:28.274
...I'll take you out there
and show you a few pointers.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.477
Or should I say three-pointers?
Because you know how I do.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.073
-Really?
-Definitely, man.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.949
Little man like you? If you get real good,
we could make some serious scrilla.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.714
-Dad!
-Hey, how you doing?

09:46.880 --> 09:49.075
-Good.
-Hey, you getting taller again?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.549
-Am l?
-lt looks like it.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.036
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.834
Hey, Double J, who you like
in the game tonight, man?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.194
Don't know and don't care.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.591
Yeah, man, I smell you. These cats
don't know nothing about basketball.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.753
-You could've schooled them, huh, J?
-That's a long time ago, Ray.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.956
What are we doing this weekend?

10:09.120 --> 10:12.954
-Okay. I wanted to talk to you about--
-Hey, hey, hey, man. What you doing?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.759
-Do you mind? I wanna talk to my son.
-Well, yeah, I mind.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.912
It's the playoffs. Can't y'all
take it outside or something?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.911
Listen, Cousin Ray...

10:21.120 --> 10:24.317
...when you start paying for the rent
and the food and everything else...

10:24.480 --> 10:27.040
...then maybe you can have
some say, okay?

10:27.200 --> 10:29.236
Weren't you supposed to be
gone 1 2 weeks ago?

10:29.400 --> 10:30.753
-Jerome!
-What?

10:31.440 --> 10:33.476
I paid for these.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.355
You shouldn't talk to him that way.
He's family.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.876
Lydia, he's your cousin Cecily's
ex-husband's brother.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.634
He's family.
And family don't put out family.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.597
Look, Jerome...

10:49.760 --> 10:52.274
...I wanted to come by
and tell you in person.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.034
I gotta head out
to Phoenix for work, tonight.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.633
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.439
I really wanted to hang out.
We would've had a lot of fun.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.795
At least can we shoot
around back a little bit?

11:01.960 --> 11:04.394
-I wish I could, but--
-I've gotten a lot better.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.755
Oh, no, no. That's not it.
It's just....

11:06.920 --> 11:08.672
Look, I got a lot going on right now.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.475
Can I show you something
in the kitchen?

11:18.280 --> 11:20.669
I really don't have time
for one of your talks, okay?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.432
I already feel bad enough about it.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.513
This is the third time in a row
you've cancelled plans on him.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.999
What do you want me to say?

11:28.160 --> 11:30.037
I'm training the staff in Phoenix.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.589
And if I do this well,
I'm due for a nice promotion.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.197
That's great. But all your son knows
is that you are a basketball legend.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.318
And he never gets to play with you.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.118
You're his hero, Jerome.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.679
Heroes are for fairy tales. I'm just a guy
trying to do well on his quarterly review.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.229
You need to make time for your son.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.958
He's 1 3 years old.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.078
Pretty soon, he's not gonna care
whether you come around or not.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.079
I told you,
the schedule is only temporary.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.750
So is his childhood.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.154
Jerome Jenkins.
There's only five seconds left.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.278
They don't know what to do.
They're down by two.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.314
He's out for the three.
Three, two, one....

13:01.400 --> 13:04.949
"MJ"? No way.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.790
-Defense!
-Damn.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.434
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

13:31.600 --> 13:33.591
That's what you get.
That's what you get.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.590
He's on fire.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.111
He puts it up--

14:03.440 --> 14:04.634
No, you didn't.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.875
What the...?

14:25.760 --> 14:29.594
--the most amazing game of basketball
played in the last decade.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.478
-How did they win?
-I guarantee...

14:31.640 --> 14:34.837
... you will not see another game like that
in a very, very long time.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.638
Oh, man!

15:26.360 --> 15:27.759
Jerome.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.715
You' re not thinking about
trying out, are you?

15:30.880 --> 15:33.553
-No, l' m just here to watch.
-Okay, I was about to say....

15:33.720 --> 15:35.915
There's a lot of serious ballers
out here, man.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.719
I don't wanna see you
embarrass yourself.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.518
-Next.
-All right.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.629
Excuse me, brother.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.390
-Hey, sweetness.
-Name?

15:45.560 --> 15:49.792
Ray Thomkins. But you probably
know me by my streetball name, X-Ray.

15:51.080 --> 15:55.039
Oh, that's a really good name for you.
Because I can see right through you.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.192
Put this on and do not take it off
until you get cut.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.794
-What? Girl, I ain't getting cut.
-Next!

16:02.280 --> 16:03.679
I need a new streetball name.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.516
Everybody! Everybody!
Welcome to the Game On Open Run.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.910
Now, you'll be divided
into teams of three.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.469
You'll play each other,
and at the end of the day...

16:13.640 --> 16:15.676
...the three most
proficient challengers...

16:15.840 --> 16:19.594
...will have the esteemed honor
of contesting the Game On team.

16:20.240 --> 16:24.233
Now, without further ado,
allow me to introduce to you...

16:24.400 --> 16:25.833
...the Game On squad.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.508
Raindrop.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.035
Ghost in the Machine.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.908
Cavity.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.633
Miracle Whip.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.271
Buck Wild. Buck Wild.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.517
And the Right Honorable Coach Archie.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.917
Game On squad!

16:56.880 --> 17:00.634
Give it up for DJ Spears.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.229
Look at these fools.
Lining up for the slaughter.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.435
You forgetting how we found you?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.991
Well, this bunch
is weaker than Wednesday.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.232
-Looks like our jobs are safe.
-Don't count your chickens yet.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.789
We've been on a losing streak
the last three cities.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.077
You don't play as well as your
opponents, they could take your seat.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.992
Man, I'll crush anybody out there.
I guarantee that.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.116
You're not the only one out there.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.989
If you guys really
wanna move beyond the street...

17:27.160 --> 17:29.469
...you're gonna have to learn
to not play selfish.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.835
It's the only way
you're gonna be great players.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.275
We already great players, okay?

17:34.440 --> 17:38.479
Ain't nobody better than us.
We the phattest team out there.

17:38.680 --> 17:42.070
No, no, fellas, listen.
Seriously, you're not fat.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.629
Not at all.
Y'all are in great shape.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.359
All right, let's get it started.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.317
The first two teams up.
Come on, y'all.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.634
Oh, that's pretty.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.553
Yeah, that's right.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.071
Oh, you gotta finish that, kid!

18:09.480 --> 18:10.754
Wait a minute.
Where'd it go?

18:19.560 --> 18:22.791
Come on, son. You out the game.
Get off the court. Move!

18:27.720 --> 18:29.312
Jordan!

18:30.960 --> 18:34.032
-I'm okay.
-Get out there, man. That's right.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.439
Oh, Rainbow!

18:40.200 --> 18:42.077
Looks like you had to.
Get over there, boy.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.432
Yeah.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.398
Oh, watch out, now.
How you feeling?

18:49.640 --> 18:51.198
Okay. That's all right, then.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.148
All right, people. All right.
Nice playing out there. Yeah.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.517
All right, so we narrowed it down
to the final three challengers.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.353
Now, what Game On
cares about is style.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.034
All right, so bring your best,
play with flair...

19:04.200 --> 19:06.395
...but play as a team and play to win.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.028
Remember, Buck, there's no I in team.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.918
There's no you in team either, fool.

19:11.080 --> 19:15.676
So, people, tell me, what time is it?
It's time to get your--

19:15.840 --> 19:17.671
-Game on!
-Game on!

19:18.000 --> 19:21.356
That's right. Let's get it cracking, y'all.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.118
Hey, what's up?
J's not out here practicing.

19:25.280 --> 19:29.796
Seriously. He must have been
abducted by aliens last night.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.833
Come on. Let's go check out
the Open Run.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.635
He's Buck Wild, y'all.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.392
Why you trying to tangle with Cavity?
Why you trying, son?

19:49.280 --> 19:50.633
Hey, what's up? Hey, Nathan.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.233
-Hey, man. How you doing?
-Good.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.031
Oh, my. Don't hurt him!

19:57.200 --> 20:00.078
Come on, son, let's go.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.280
Oh, my God, Cavity.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.556
You don't know where
the ball is, do you?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.790
You don't even know where it is.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.878
Oh, you didn't see that wall?
Oh, yeah. We call it Buck Wild.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.029
Get up, punk.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.593
Cavity, defying all of gravity!

20:31.880 --> 20:33.757
Where the ball, kid?
Yeah, that's right.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.232
It's too late.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.914
No competition. It's ridiculous.
Winning shot.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.995
Oh, what's this?

20:47.160 --> 20:49.469
Think you can drop the rock
better than Buck Wild?

20:49.640 --> 20:52.234
Go on, then. Put it up, then.
Go on, scrub.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.594
Come on, man.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.038
-Oh, my God.
-Give me that. Give me that.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.912
This is it, baby.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.512
What?!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.956
-Give it to the kid.
-Let the kid shoot it.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.348
-Let him shoot it.
-Come on.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.431
Think you could do it again?
Huh, peewee?

21:19.600 --> 21:21.989
-Give it to the kid.
-Go on.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.556
You got it. You can make it.
You can make it.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.471
Nothing.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.232
Get out here. Let's see if you
can do it for real, in a game.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.709
Come on. Get out!

21:42.160 --> 21:43.752
Let's go.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.955
Come on, lucky sneakers.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.559
-Hold on, Buck.
-Back off!

21:50.720 --> 21:53.314
One-on-one, me and the kid.
Now, come on, let's do this.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.710
-Everybody off the court! Everybody!
-Hey, man.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.757
Get off the court.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.315
Is he allowed to do that?

22:03.200 --> 22:07.273
-Get off me!
-Buck, you're manhandling him.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.273
Come on, Buck. That ain't right.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.517
Over. It's over. Oh, my God.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.352
How you like me now?

22:14.800 --> 22:15.994
Not so much.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.715
Do you hear that? The whole crowd's
turning against you. What are you doing?

22:20.880 --> 22:23.792
I ain't letting no punk kid show me up.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.038
That's one, midget.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.238
Yeah.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.433
Come on. What you got?

22:36.800 --> 22:38.313
What the--?

22:39.120 --> 22:42.635
Oh, man. He's got them going crazy.
They coming out on the court.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.995
-You lucky I tripped.
-It's bedlam. It's over.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.833
-I can't control them.
-Yeah, J.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.434
Hey, you like that kid?
You know that's my nephew.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.798
Yeah, I'm like his manager.
More like his mentor.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.599
You know, I love the kids.
Each one, teach one.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.795
You like kids?

23:03.320 --> 23:05.072
Do you mind?

23:06.600 --> 23:09.558
What, huh?
You think this is funny?

23:09.720 --> 23:11.551
I ain't playing.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.789
That's it. Next point wins.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.633
No, he didn't. No, he did not!

23:17.800 --> 23:20.633
Buck Wild is going out
on a limb here, y'all.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.270
-It's a death match. Two men enter--
-Just shut up and call the game.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.070
All right. Ball's in.
Come on, let's see it. Give it to me.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.953
What?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.150
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.757
Kid's on fire now. Yeah.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.276
All right. You got hops,
but do you got handles?

23:44.440 --> 23:46.670
-Come on. Let's go.
-Ball's in play. Let's go.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.398
Come on, now.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.394
Oh, no.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.108
What?

23:54.680 --> 23:58.468
-Holy bull's-eye! Oh, my goodness!
-Oh, my....

24:00.920 --> 24:02.512
Unbelievable.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.794
Oh, snap! Well, I guess we know
who's getting off the bus today.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.075
-Man, Buck--
-Forget you.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.275
Don't be upset with me.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.829
-You brought it on yourself.
-Did you just see that?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.752
-Yo, hold up--
-Did you just see that?

24:13.920 --> 24:16.070
-Did you see that?
-Of course I saw it.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.439
-That was mighty impressive, kid.
-Thanks.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.309
-They tell me you're Double J's kid.
-Yep.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.597
Well, we'd sure like it if you'd join us
on the Game On bus.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.831
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.593
-Coach?
-Yeah?

24:36.480 --> 24:38.516
Could you help me down?

24:41.160 --> 24:42.912
Excuse me.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.833
Did I overhear you say
you're Jerome Jenkins' manager?

24:46.000 --> 24:49.709
-Why? What did he do?
-I'm with Surefire Sports Marketing.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.111
I think Jerome could be
an advertiser's dream.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.993
Then I'm Ray Thomkins,
Jerome Jenkins' manager.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.117
Oh, my God.
Did you see him out there?

24:59.280 --> 25:02.078
He was like Jordan, shooting
shots from the three-point line.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.912
Dude, you won the Open Run.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.753
How did you do that?

25:07.360 --> 25:09.999
-I don't know.
-No, seriously, J.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.993
What's gotten into you, man?
How'd you play like that?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.792
All right. Come here.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.354
Now, listen, you can't tell a soul.

25:19.520 --> 25:23.035
Craziest thing happened last night.
I was out in the alley shooting hoops...

25:23.200 --> 25:26.476
...and I found this pair of sneakers,
so I took them up to my room.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.756
And then there was this explosion.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.399
And the power went out.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.518
The shoes were glowing.
I think they're magic.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.351
I told you he was abducted by aliens.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.195
Did they probe you?

25:39.760 --> 25:42.228
Seriously, check this out.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.149
-"MJ"?
-"MJ"?

25:44.840 --> 25:46.990
-No way.
-No way.

25:47.160 --> 25:49.958
Guys, they invited me
to the Game On tour bus.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.235
Man, that's unbelievable.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.277
Does that mean
you'll be gone all summer?

25:53.440 --> 25:55.431
What do you expect?
He's a big star now.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.511
He doesn't have time
for us little people.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.671
I can't believe you're playing
for Game On.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.071
I'm automatically in the finals at
the King of the Concrete tournament.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.550
Wait a minute. That means
you'll get a shot at the $5000?

26:06.720 --> 26:10.110
Plus my name on the Ball of Fame.
And I get to choose my own teammates.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.590
Oh, that's great.
It's too bad you can't go.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.309
-But why not?
-Well, because you're a child.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.311
They're not letting a minor
on that bus.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.358
Not without any adult supervision
or some kind of chaperon...

26:22.520 --> 26:24.351
...or somebody to look over you.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.794
Really?

26:25.960 --> 26:28.349
Yeah, you're gonna have
to find somebody over 1 8...

26:28.520 --> 26:31.478
...who has the summer off,
who knows the streetball scene.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.518
Someone who could watch your back
and give you tips and advice.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.989
-I bet you know just the person.
-Well, yeah, but--

26:37.320 --> 26:39.959
My dad. Thanks, man.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.397
-Weren't you trying out today too?
-I didn't see you. What happened?

26:45.560 --> 26:46.834
Yeah, well, I was there.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.595
I just couldn't bring my A game
because my acid reflux was acting up.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.517
-This is Mr. Jenkins.
-Dad.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.750
Jerome, is something wrong?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.353
No, I just need to talk to you.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.359
This is not the best time.
Can I call you back tonight?

27:04.520 --> 27:06.795
No, Dad, look,
something really weird is going on.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.669
I found these sneakers, and now I can
play basketball like you wouldn't believe.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.673
I won the Open Run, and they
invited me on the Game On tour.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.593
Slow down. You did what?
You got invited where?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.910
To go on tour with
Game On this summer.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.957
Wait a minute.
You're just a kid.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.351
I'm better than everyone out there.
Coach says I could be a real star.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.197
-Look, you've got plenty of time--
-They're leaving tonight.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.794
They won't let me on without
a guardian. Come with me?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.235
Jerome, I don't know what's
going on back there...

27:33.400 --> 27:35.960
...but you're gonna have
a lot of opportunities in life.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.395
Not all of them are gonna be
ones you should pursue.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.875
I can't take that kind of time off work.
I just can't do it.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.792
I' m sorry. I hope you understand.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.758
-You would come if it wasn't basketball.
-That is not true.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.309
Listen, I'm gonna have
to call you back later, okay?

27:50.480 --> 27:52.789
I'll call you tonight, all right?

27:55.760 --> 27:58.593
I don't know.
It just seems like a lot so fast.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.796
But it's not.
It's just through the summer.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.075
We don't have any plans.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.958
Don't you have summer school
anyway?

28:04.120 --> 28:06.111
And it's a blessing that
I'm here when I am.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.555
He needs an older masculine
figure in his life.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.075
Not to mention family
that can watch his back...

28:11.240 --> 28:14.676
...and make sure he doesn't
get taken advantage of. You feel me?

28:15.640 --> 28:17.949
I really should ask
your father what he thinks.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.792
-I already asked him.
-And?

28:20.320 --> 28:22.754
And it's about basketball.
What do you think he said?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.951
I guess my little boy's growing up.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.796
Promise me you'll brush your teeth,
you'll stay away from candy bars.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.793
-I promise.
-I was talking to Jerome.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.752
-I promise too.
-And you'll call home every night?

28:39.920 --> 28:41.194
Of course.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.513
I guess we gotta get you packed.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.592
Yes!

28:45.760 --> 28:49.435
-Yes, yes, yes. We going. We going.
-Yes, yes, yes. We going. We going.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.636
-Yeah, we're going! We're going.
-Yeah, yeah!

28:51.800 --> 28:53.313
Yeah!

28:53.640 --> 28:57.758
-Man, this is incredible. Do you see this?
-Hey, hey, chill out. Act like we belong.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.593
Look how high it is.
What do you think that's for?

29:00.760 --> 29:02.512
I don't know. Just forget about it.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.750
I bet that's where they
put their basketballs.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.036
Come on, man.
We gotta be cool, now. Come on.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.955
All right. Go on.
That's you, that's you.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.953
Welcome aboard, little man.
You did your thing out there, son.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.078
I'm Cavity.
Because I'm so sweet, baby.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.629
Hey, what up? I'm Raindrop.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.509
Yo, I'm Preacher.
Thank you for taking out Buck Wild.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.513
Couldn't stand another day
with that mean mother on this bus.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.353
Howdy, I'm Dalton.
They all call me Miracle Whip.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.636
-I'm Jerome.
-What do they call you?

29:50.360 --> 29:51.793
Jerome.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.633
Yo, that's right. We gotta give
Jerome a streetball name.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.472
How about Boy Wonder?

29:56.920 --> 30:00.549
-Half Pint.
-No, no, no. Shorty By Nature.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.232
Sometimes they come quick...

30:03.400 --> 30:06.073
...but sometimes they
just have to reveal themselves.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.993
Don't worry, kid.
You'll find your name.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.151
How about Little Gimmick?
That's what he is.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.274
Oh, that's Ghost in the Machine.
Don't mind him.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.159
He's the only one on this bus
who liked Buck Wild.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.073
Hey, hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
I'm Ray.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.949
Y'all probably know me
by my streetball name, Bucket Head?

30:24.280 --> 30:26.350
Okay. Well, how about Butternut?

30:26.520 --> 30:29.876
Y'all don't know that? On the East Coast,
they called me Finger-Licking.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.156
I got one. How about
Get Off the Bus Right Now?

30:32.320 --> 30:35.118
-Yeah!
-Only Game On players allowed, son.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.793
So you got to step, now.

30:37.160 --> 30:41.039
Oh, okay. All right. Well, my bad.
I'll gonna follow in my whip, J.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.952
I'll see you at the hotel in Bay City.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.680
And I'm gonna see y'all
at the after party! Okay, right?

30:48.200 --> 30:49.997
One love.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.469
-Hello, groupies.
-I love college games.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.392
Hey, boys. Locker rooms are
downstairs and to the left.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.354
And the new team photo is gonna
happen on the court in a half an hour.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.432
-You must be Jerome Jenkins.
-Are you a groupie?

31:54.440 --> 31:57.352
No. I'm Lexi Lopez, the team publicist.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.715
I'm gonna need to get
a bio on you ASAP.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.516
-Will it hurt?
-You are so cute.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.796
We'll catch up after the game.

32:07.800 --> 32:12.157
Don't get any ideas, little man.
Sexy Lexi doesn't date ballplayers.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.232
What? No, I wasn't thinking anything.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.192
Hey, Dalton.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.514
I'm okay.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.270
Bay City is in for a rude awakening.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.238
They ain't never seen
moves like mine before.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.799
We gonna shine so bright...

32:33.960 --> 32:36.599
...they're gonna need
sunglasses to see us, son.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.829
Have y'all ever watched
a man who can really dance?

32:42.240 --> 32:44.276
Yo, that's cool, coach,
if that's your thing.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.714
Will you please hear me out?

32:45.880 --> 32:50.954
Now, when a man who can dance
is grooving with his lady...

32:51.120 --> 32:53.588
...he doesn't try to outdo her.

32:53.760 --> 32:57.275
He just keeps it simple
and lets her shine.

32:57.440 --> 33:01.752
Because the better she dances...

33:02.440 --> 33:04.431
...the cooler he looks.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.554
But we don't have any
ladies on the team, coach.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.830
Get on the court, y'all.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.834
Yeah, these college kids, man,
they ain't playing around.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.315
Bay City's for real.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.156
Oh, my goodness.
They're getting it again.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.312
-Ghost, D up, man.
-Game On, you guys better step it up.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.589
-Come on, you guys.
-Here they come. Here they come.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.629
Oh, he blew by him. He blew by.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.236
Come on, Raindrop.
You gotta get in that game, son.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.834
Get that rebound.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.429
-Game On ball.
-Come on.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.238
-Jerome.
-Yeah, coach?

33:40.400 --> 33:43.517
Let's see if you can shake these
guys up a little bit. Get in there.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.274
Sub. Go on.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.711
Come on, lucky sneakers.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.598
What's this? Coach Archie's
sending in the little man...

33:55.760 --> 33:58.069
...Jerome Jenkins Jr.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.910
All right, check him out, man.
Check him out.

34:09.639 --> 34:10.993
Yeah. Oh, my--

34:29.560 --> 34:30.958
That's my boy, Miracle Whip.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.192
That's right, y'all. Miracle Whip.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.793
Come on. Give me something.
D it up. Let's see what you got.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.469
Oh, my goodness.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.672
Raindrop, baby. Raindrop.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.359
That's...

35:17.520 --> 35:18.953
...game, y'all.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.398
Dude, you were
unbelievable out there.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.913
Hey, you guys made it.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.911
Rodney's mom
is driving us to your games.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.991
We're staying at
the Holiday lnn downtown.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.674
That's cool. Hey, look, this is crazy.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.796
I gotta call you guys.
We gotta celebrate.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.916
Sign here, sign here!

36:09.280 --> 36:11.953
Oh, I got you, little piggy.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.353
Dalton, you're in serious need
of a little fun in your life.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.514
-I'm having fun.
-Man, you're clipping your toenails.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.950
-I know. Check this one out.
-Dalton.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.873
Let's just go out and meet some
of the locals. They love us.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.270
-Oh, no. I can't.
-Why not?

36:31.520 --> 36:33.351
-You're gonna laugh.
-I won't.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.995
-I'm scared of girls.
-What?

36:40.200 --> 36:41.792
I said, I'm afraid of girls.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.479
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

36:44.240 --> 36:46.879
-You promised you weren't gonna laugh.
-Wait. No, Dalton.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.031
Come here, man. I'm gonna help you.

36:49.200 --> 36:52.954
You can't. I'm a lost cause. I just....

36:53.120 --> 36:55.395
-I don't know how to be around them.
-It's simple.

36:55.560 --> 36:59.235
If you want a girl, you gotta show her
you know how to treat her right.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.790
-How do you mean?
-Take her somewhere nice.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.838
Take her out to dinner.
Show her the finer things of life.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.719
-Well, like what?
-Well, I like to go to Royal Burger.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.677
And get her her own bag
of gummy worms.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.035
Then go back to my place
and play video games.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.031
But that's just me.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.317
You sure do know
a lot about women, Jerome.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.196
-What's up, man?
-I heard we were going out.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.038
No, you heard we were going out.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.077
Sorry, kid. Limo's for grown folk.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.316
Who's the cowboy?

37:47.520 --> 37:48.999
How you doing, Tex?

37:49.680 --> 37:52.035
-I gotta go.
-What do you mean?

37:52.240 --> 37:55.152
-I gotta go floss.
-But--

37:55.760 --> 37:58.228
Look at him. He's too cute.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.955
Yeah, he's adorable.
Just let him in. He'll be all right.

38:06.760 --> 38:10.275
Oh, my God. This is incredible.
Do you see this? Oh, look at--

38:10.440 --> 38:11.953
And they got the little--

38:12.440 --> 38:15.318
Excuse me. Sorry.
Man, this is incredible.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.072
Compliments of
Game On lncorporated.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.708
When you play with style,
you ride in style, baby.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.598
Yeah, son.

38:22.560 --> 38:26.235
-ls this your first time in a limo too?
-Afraid not.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.594
Wait a minute, y'all.
I know you got room for one more.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.796
Wait. You're leaving me.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.991
Keep it close, young man.
I won't be long.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.913
What? Don't nobody--
Are you serious?

38:45.720 --> 38:48.029
Valet. Boy, this Versace.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.997
-May l?
-Thank you.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.677
You just along for the ride, baby.
This is for big boys only, son.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.558
Back inside, back inside.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.280
-But I wanna go--
-Yeah, I know what you want.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.112
Who wanna dance with Preacher?

39:18.720 --> 39:21.154
What do you desire, Jerome?

39:22.440 --> 39:23.998
God?

39:25.800 --> 39:28.473
No, Dan. Your driver?

39:28.640 --> 39:30.278
Is there somewhere you'd like to go?

39:30.440 --> 39:33.716
-You'll take me anywhere?
-The car's yours for the night.

39:36.920 --> 39:40.356
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

39:56.560 --> 39:58.357
Hey, we came up with your nickname.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.114
Oh, yeah. You know how
your dad used to be Double J?

40:01.280 --> 40:03.350
-Right.
-Well, you should be:

40:03.520 --> 40:05.875
-Triple J.
-Triple J.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.069
"Triple J" on three.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.708
One, two, three, Triple J!

40:11.880 --> 40:13.393
Mama?

40:22.400 --> 40:24.868
Seriously? I mean,
I was thinking of something like...

40:25.040 --> 40:29.556
...Gravy Train or Blockbuster
or Lil' Money Grip.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.674
Triple J.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.037
All right. I mean, I guess it's cool,
if you're not gonna--

40:35.200 --> 40:36.474
Never mind, man.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.119
Wait, no. If I'm not gonna what?

40:38.280 --> 40:40.191
You can call yourself
whatever you want...

40:40.360 --> 40:43.875
...but if you not gonna give the fans
what they want, what's the difference?

40:44.040 --> 40:45.473
What do you mean?

40:45.640 --> 40:48.837
Supply and demand.
See, you got mad talent.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.831
You just gotta flaunt it.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.072
See, in this sport, people want a star.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.435
They don't care if you
could pass or set a pick.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.636
They wanna see moves
they've never seen.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.189
See you hit shots they can't believe.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.833
Sexy Lexi.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.313
-Good morning, Dalton.
-Hey.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.192
Look, I'm not gonna front, Jerome.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.158
-You the best player out there.
-Really?

41:14.320 --> 41:15.389
All I'm saying is...

41:15.560 --> 41:19.838
...don't let these ballplayers,
or anybody, stop you.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.436
Hey, the worse tragedy in life
is to see talent wasted.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.636
And I know you know that.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.271
Thanks, Cousin Ray.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.996
Yeah, man. We going to the top.

41:33.160 --> 41:36.436
You stick with me,
I got your back, baby.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.078
We don't even know how to stop.

41:39.240 --> 41:43.472
We just keep on going, keep on moving.
Moving on up.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.992
Come on, baby.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.473
Come on, Purple Demon, give it to me.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.590
-ls this seat taken?
-Yes.

42:01.960 --> 42:06.317
I mean, no.
I mean-- Excuse me.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.438
You know, it's weird.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.352
No matter how nice
I am to that boy...

42:11.520 --> 42:13.272
...he always acts so rude around me.

42:16.080 --> 42:19.197
Hey, hey, listen. Look, I know
you want Jerome at your benefit.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.874
But what about his benefit
and my benefit?

42:22.040 --> 42:23.996
You gonna have to come up
with more money.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.718
That's what I said, more money.

42:25.880 --> 42:28.348
Now, look-- Hold on.
I'm in a lunch meeting right now.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.191
Hello? This is Ray.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.237
Oh, hey, hey, Aunt Lydia.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.119
Oh, yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.635
Yeah, he's just having a blast.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.588
Well, you should be proud.
I mean, we all are.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.275
Oh, believe me. Nobody's behind
Jerome more than I am.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.114
You gonna get hurt.

43:04.760 --> 43:07.433
Black Tops. Black Tops, baby.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.955
That's right.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.113
Go home.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.955
Don't worry about this, man.
We got these chumps.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.634
Hey, Pre.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.633
What's the 41 1 on
the brother with all the ink?

43:24.880 --> 43:27.713
That's Flex "Bring the Pain" Watts.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.871
-From Utah State?
-Yeah.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.190
I wondered what happened to him.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.193
Oh, well, he transferred
to Ohio State...

43:35.680 --> 43:36.829
...Penitentiary.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.271
Come on, now.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.712
I mean, I'm not gonna front, Jerome.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.189
You the best player out there.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.434
Triple J, I'm open.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.073
-Yeah.
-That's what I'm talking about.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.991
Give it to Raindrop.
Give it to Raindrop.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.072
-Come on! Come on!
-Jerome, you got help.

44:14.280 --> 44:15.508
Triple J, I'm open.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.835
-What are you doing, J?
-J, pass it. I'm open.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.639
-What's this boy doing?
-J, pass the ball.

44:46.640 --> 44:47.868
What?

44:48.040 --> 44:51.157
We did it. Nobody gets cut.
We all stay on the bus.

44:51.320 --> 44:53.038
Way to go, boys.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.998
So much for team play, though,
huh, coach?

44:58.440 --> 45:01.159
Yeah, Triple J T -shirts.
Get your T -shirts.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.993
Autographed pictures.
Get your autographed picture.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.878
Give me some money.
Give me the money.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.112
What you got? There you go, girl.
Thank you. Get your T -shirts.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.038
You're from Bounce magazine, right?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.792
I'm Lexi Lopez with Game On.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.914
Thank you. Love you.
Love you so much.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.358
Oh, man.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.869
Know what would be awesome?
A shot of the team.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.553
How about in five?

45:22.720 --> 45:25.359
-Let me talk to you for a second.
-Just one sec.

45:25.560 --> 45:28.120
-What?
-They came to talk to me about Triple J.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.919
Stop trying to steal my thunder, girl.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.549
-Whatever.
-That's right.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.672
-Great job, man.
-That was nice.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.757
-Thank you.
-Awesome game, man.

45:40.920 --> 45:42.717
Another great game, J.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.478
-Hey, what's up?
-Totally.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.108
My mom said she'll take us
all out to dinner.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.197
Cool. Let me ask Cousin Ray.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.233
He's great with interviews.
The boy knows how to talk well.

45:52.400 --> 45:56.439
Excuse me. Is it okay if I go
out to dinner with Nathan and Rodney?

45:58.920 --> 46:02.230
No, man. I'm hooking you up with
a cover shoot for Bounce magazine.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.551
Jerome, my mom's gonna bring
the car around so we can all have--

46:05.760 --> 46:08.752
Tweedledum, will you stop
calling him Jerome? It's Triple J.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.234
We know. We came up with it.

46:10.400 --> 46:13.039
You didn't come up with nothing.
I came up with it all.

46:13.200 --> 46:17.398
I put this all together. Why don't you
make like Michael Jackson and beat it.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.434
So are you coming or not?

46:22.360 --> 46:23.793
Oh, no. Come here, man.

46:25.560 --> 46:28.233
Look, you about to take off.
You on the launching pad.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.038
And the countdown has just begun.

46:30.200 --> 46:33.158
Look, your boys back there,
they don't understand, man.

46:33.320 --> 46:35.550
You about to become
a streetball legend.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.790
Now, you need to let them go,
just for now.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.350
Okay? They gonna forgive you later
when you bring them to the mansion.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.080
Yeah, and they swimming around
in the pool.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.310
But, look,
we gotta look at every angle now.

46:46.480 --> 46:47.799
You know what you need to do.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.071
I'm gonna have to
catch up with you later.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.953
-Man, whatever, Triple J.
-Don't be like that, Nathan.

46:54.120 --> 46:56.953
-I got a lot going on right now.
-Well, what about us?

46:57.640 --> 46:59.870
Here you go. On the house.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.552
-Thanks a lot.
-Hey, everybody else is paying 1 0 bucks.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.711
You're charging people for autographs?

47:06.920 --> 47:10.117
If you don't charge nothing,
it ain't worth nothing. You smell me?

47:11.600 --> 47:13.636
Come on, Triple J.
Let's get on out of here.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.149
Your sneakers should be
signing the autographs.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.918
Hey, Preach.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.511
What's their problem?

48:27.320 --> 48:31.074
-They're not the ones with the problem.
-What are you talking about?

48:32.080 --> 48:35.834
You know what my daddy used to say
about a pig that breaks out of the stall?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.069
What?

48:37.280 --> 48:39.157
See, he may think he's free...

48:39.320 --> 48:41.356
...but he still smells like a pig.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.913
-What's that supposed to mean?
-lt means your playing stinks.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.914
But we're winning.
Everyone gets to stay on the team.

48:48.080 --> 48:51.629
You don't get it. Every one of us here
is trying to get to the next level.

48:51.840 --> 48:55.150
Sponsorship, the European leagues.
Heck, even the pros.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.873
How are we supposed to do that...

48:57.040 --> 49:00.271
...when the only player anyone
is watching on this team is you?

49:01.320 --> 49:04.756
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to stretch my legs.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.674
That was not pretty.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.873
Dang, Ghost.

49:24.720 --> 49:28.508
All right, fellas. Now, before you go,
I've got a few things to say...

49:28.680 --> 49:30.193
...and I want you to listen up.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.828
Now, just because
we have a few days off...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.355
...doesn't mean it's time to party.

49:35.560 --> 49:38.154
We've got the biggest game
we've ever played coming up...

49:38.320 --> 49:39.912
...day after tomorrow at the arena.

49:40.080 --> 49:42.753
Which means
each and every one of you...

49:42.920 --> 49:45.309
...gots to bring your A game.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.673
All right? Y'all be back here on
Wednesday at 3:00 sharp...

49:49.840 --> 49:52.195
...to leave for the hotel.
Any questions?

49:54.080 --> 49:55.399
All right. Get out of here.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.473
Didn't you see a brother standing there?
You blind?

50:01.680 --> 50:04.353
You too tall.
You don't get no oxygen to the brain.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.193
Lord, have mercy.

50:08.280 --> 50:12.717
-This is so cool, Ma.
-It's the way I feel part of this thing.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.119
-Has Dad seen this?
-Your father has been traveling a lot...

50:16.280 --> 50:19.192
...but he did say that he'd
come by to see you tonight.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.519
-Can I ask you a question?
-Of course, sweetie. What is it?

50:24.080 --> 50:26.355
-Do you believe in magic?
-What do you mean?

50:26.520 --> 50:28.795
Do you think people get things
they don't deserve?

50:30.800 --> 50:32.677
Well, I'm not sure if it's magic...

50:32.840 --> 50:36.833
...but I've often found that the thing
that you thought was impossible...

50:37.000 --> 50:38.433
...is just the thing to happen.

50:38.640 --> 50:41.791
And the thing that you were
sure was gonna come through...

50:42.160 --> 50:43.593
...never happens at all.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.599
Jerome...

50:49.040 --> 50:50.792
...you are a very special boy...

50:50.960 --> 50:55.238
...and everything that you want in life,
you deserve to have.

50:58.520 --> 51:01.239
Okay, skybox? Oh, you know
I could hook that up.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.750
All right, we gonna be in a skybox.
All right. This is Big Ray.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.753
Hey, blowing up.

51:07.920 --> 51:10.150
Hey, what's up?
Oh, hey, Gina!

51:10.320 --> 51:11.799
It's like this all the time now.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.276
Oh, okay. Well, we'll be there.
Thanks for calling. All right, now.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.635
All right, easy. Okay, peace.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.678
What was all that about?

51:20.840 --> 51:23.991
That was Midas Records.
They're shooting a Lothario video.

51:24.200 --> 51:27.112
And Cousin Ray got Triple J a cameo.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.117
-Really?
-And that's not all.

51:29.280 --> 51:32.431
The Trend Apparel execs are coming
to the arena to watch you play.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.511
They're thinking about
sponsoring Jerome.

51:34.680 --> 51:36.989
Making him one of the models
for their b-ball line.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.071
Ray, isn't this all a bit much?

51:39.240 --> 51:41.959
Come on, now, Lydia.
You gotta strike while the iron is hot.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.759
And right now,
it's hotter than fish grease.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.672
What about the money
he'll be making?

51:46.840 --> 51:49.877
You know what?
I'm glad you asked that. Check this out.

51:52.160 --> 51:55.197
-A contract?
-Just a standard management agreement.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.874
Just gives me 1 5 percent
of all the future earnings.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.790
I mean, most managers want
like 20, 30 percent.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.877
Why do we need
something like this now?

52:04.040 --> 52:07.555
Because after the arena game,
he's gonna be getting all kind of offers.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.711
This just gives me power
to negotiate deals.

52:09.880 --> 52:12.474
Believe me, no deals will be made
without your consent.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.071
I should have a lawyer
take a look at these.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.674
Well, see, I'm just saying
these deals come and go.

52:18.840 --> 52:22.549
If the Trend execs think we're
dragging our feet, they might cool off.

52:24.040 --> 52:26.600
I don't know.
I mean, is this good for Jerome?

52:26.760 --> 52:29.638
Is it good? Come on.
It's the American dream.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.872
We're talking about scholarship funds,
retirement funds.

52:33.040 --> 52:37.238
Fun-in-the-sun funds!
It's what everybody wishes for.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.954
I'll let you talk to them...

52:39.120 --> 52:42.396
...but I wanna hear all the specifics
before we agree to anything.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.192
You have my word on that.

52:51.640 --> 52:54.632
We better get to that Lothario video.
All right, now, Lydia.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.552
But your father will be here at 6.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.470
Don't worry. We'll be back by then
if he shows.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.996
Hey, so you a PA? AD?
You in the union?

53:20.200 --> 53:21.758
What is wrong with you people?

53:23.120 --> 53:24.439
Come on.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.999
Boy, you crazy?

53:26.200 --> 53:28.475
Bye. Call me?

53:32.200 --> 53:33.474
Cut.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.954
Tail slate.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.628
That's lunch, people. Thirty minutes.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.394
-Why are you taking me out?
-Just calm down.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.915
-Man, come on. What are you--?
-Come on. Let's go.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.713
Let go. You're embarrassing me.

53:44.880 --> 53:47.599
You seem to be doing
a pretty good job of that by yourself.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.991
-What are you talking about?
-Bragging in magazines, riding in limos?

53:51.160 --> 53:52.912
Acting a fool in some music video?

53:53.080 --> 53:55.116
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.316
Big surprise.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.192
I hear...

54:01.360 --> 54:04.432
...Ray's trying to line up some
big endorsement deal for you.

54:04.640 --> 54:07.313
Yeah, Trend Apparel.
I'm gonna be their poster boy.

54:07.480 --> 54:11.155
You know you can't play college ball
if you get paid from endorsements.

54:11.680 --> 54:14.433
You know, you can use your gift
and better yourself.

54:14.640 --> 54:16.915
You can get a scholarship
to a good school...

54:17.080 --> 54:18.672
...and get an education.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.912
Or you can-- You can bet it all right now,
with the hopes of what?

54:22.080 --> 54:24.913
Becoming a legend?
I know too many playground legends...

54:25.080 --> 54:27.469
...that can't afford
to put food on their tables.

54:27.640 --> 54:30.359
-That's not gonna happen to me.
-That's what they tell you.

54:30.520 --> 54:33.671
You're gonna be the best there
ever was. You'll be rich and famous.

54:33.840 --> 54:37.230
But when you're at the foul line
and you think about all the money...

54:37.400 --> 54:39.789
...and how much better you are
than your teammates...

54:39.960 --> 54:42.190
...it gets kind of hard to see the basket.

54:42.400 --> 54:47.554
And when you miss,
suddenly, miraculously...

54:47.720 --> 54:51.349
...no one's around to tell you
anything anymore.

54:53.080 --> 54:55.435
That was you. That's not me.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.758
But you're following in my shoes.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.639
You're playing with your head,
not with your heart.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.756
Hey, Jerome...

55:04.240 --> 55:06.834
...the game is supposed to be pure.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.760
-It's supposed to be fun.
-You haven't been to one game.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.912
-It's not that I don't want to.
-You don't want me to succeed.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.991
That's not true.
I'm worried about you.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.469
Ray says people are afraid
to go for their dreams.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.232
Then they regret their whole lives.

55:19.880 --> 55:22.838
Do you really think that fool
has your best interests in mind?

55:23.600 --> 55:25.556
At least he's there.

55:29.280 --> 55:32.352
I'm telling you, Preacher.
That is music. That's music right there.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.431
Now, how many times
do I have to say this?

55:34.600 --> 55:39.355
We have to do it on a Tuesday.
I can't change the schedule. Yeah.

55:39.520 --> 55:42.114
Okay, I'm gonna have to
call you back about this. Thanks.

55:42.280 --> 55:46.796
Okay, so we have the S&N interview
on Wednesday...

55:46.960 --> 55:50.999
...and I got you a photo shoot
for Teen Scene on Thursday.

55:51.160 --> 55:53.628
Oh, no. I promised to do
a charity event...

55:53.800 --> 55:56.712
...at Westlake Hospital's children's ward
while we were in town.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.235
I know I can't get any of
these guys to come.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.868
Okay. I better make some calls.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.199
Hey, Dalton.

56:11.360 --> 56:14.158
Coach told me to ask you
if you can put these up in his room.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.594
What are they?

56:15.760 --> 56:20.470
Autographed Game On balls.
Oh, it's room 624.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.592
All right.

56:41.160 --> 56:44.550
Hey, Dalton.
What are those?

56:45.440 --> 56:47.078
Autographed basketballs?

56:47.800 --> 56:50.394
Not only are you the sweetest thing
in the whole world...

56:50.600 --> 56:52.397
...you are a genius.

56:52.600 --> 56:55.273
-I can't believe you're coming with me.
-I am?

56:55.480 --> 56:57.630
The kids are gonna absolutely freak.

56:57.840 --> 57:00.115
-Yeah, me too.
-Come on.

57:00.280 --> 57:03.397
I mean, anything for the children.

57:07.720 --> 57:11.030
There you are. Where you been?
I been looking all over for you.

57:11.200 --> 57:12.872
I went for a swim.
Why? What's up?

57:13.040 --> 57:14.029
I got good news.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.634
The Trend Apparel execs
are gonna meet us at the game.

57:16.800 --> 57:19.314
So you gotta bring the pain.
Shine like never before.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.993
All right.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.430
Ray, are you sure
this is a good idea?

57:24.600 --> 57:26.591
I mean, the whole endorsement thing.

57:26.760 --> 57:29.513
You don't think I should wait
and play college ball?

57:29.680 --> 57:31.511
College? How many times
I gotta tell you?

57:31.680 --> 57:34.274
College is for people that
don't know what they want.

57:34.440 --> 57:36.556
It's a waste of time.
I didn't go to college.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.392
Look at me.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.191
Right. We going
straight to the pros, man.

57:41.360 --> 57:42.918
All right?

57:48.840 --> 57:50.558
Hey, Jerome.

57:51.080 --> 57:53.389
It's not nice to lie to people
for your amusement.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.919
It wasn't just for amusement.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.315
The world isn't some
video game you get to play.

57:57.480 --> 58:00.040
There's people's emotions
and feelings involved.

58:00.240 --> 58:01.468
-Dalton, l--
-Let me finish.

58:01.680 --> 58:02.999
Now, you pushed me.

58:03.160 --> 58:04.912
You knew I was scared.
You didn't care.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.799
You tricked me into doing something
I would have never done.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.195
And for that, all I have to say is...

58:10.920 --> 58:13.878
...thanks for the assist, Jerome.
I'll see you at the game.

58:16.760 --> 58:17.909
Ladies and gentlemen...

58:18.080 --> 58:21.390
...welcome to the Foot Locker
Three-On-Three Championship.

58:21.560 --> 58:24.438
This is truly an awe-inspiring evening.

58:24.600 --> 58:29.230
Amassed here tonight are the best
streetball players in the country.

58:29.440 --> 58:32.193
There is a lot at stake.
There is a lot to prove.

58:32.360 --> 58:35.079
And there are a lot of opportunities
here tonight.

58:35.280 --> 58:37.350
This is great.
I'm so glad you guys came.

58:37.520 --> 58:40.432
Trend sneakers, I could see him in them,
just doing this:

58:40.600 --> 58:43.637
One of these little moves right here
with the Trend sneaks on.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.997
Well, this is nice, Ray,
but we'd like to cut to the chase.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.515
We'd really like to see
Jerome in the sneakers.

58:49.680 --> 58:50.795
-Right now?
-Tonight.

58:50.960 --> 58:52.757
-He needs to put them on?
-That's right.

58:52.920 --> 58:56.754
Okay. All right. I'll make sure
he put them on. Okay? All right.

58:56.920 --> 58:59.388
If somebody knocks,
don't worry about that, okay?

58:59.560 --> 59:01.391
It's just the wind. This is our spot.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.391
I'll turn some music on.
Want some music?

59:03.560 --> 59:06.358
You look like you could dance.
All right.

59:06.560 --> 59:08.391
That's something you don't
see every day.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.757
The coaches are stopping
to greet each other on the sidelines.

59:11.960 --> 59:15.270
-We're gonna bury you.
-Still mad because I didn't put you in?

59:15.440 --> 59:17.078
I'd have hit the shot.
We'd have won.

59:17.280 --> 59:20.113
-Way too much of a ball hog.
-We would have won the game.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.719
-Showboat.
-Low rent.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.558
-Phony.
-Small-time.

59:24.320 --> 59:26.311
-Good game.
-Good game.

59:39.600 --> 59:42.512
Hey, Jerome. Come here, man.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.599
-Jerome.
-Hey.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.990
Look, man,
it's not important who's not here.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.236
What's important is who is here.
All right?

59:54.400 --> 59:56.834
You better than this whole league,
and you know it.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.917
Check these out.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.229
-What are those?
-They Trend sneaks.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.868
-They want you to wear them.
-No way. I can't.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.752
That's what we been working for.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.718
I'll wear them in an ad,
but I gotta wear my lucky shoes.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.869
Come on, Jerome.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.634
We got them on the line.
All we gotta do is reel them in.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.791
You deserve this.
Don't second-guess this.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.439
I have to wear my lucky shoes.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.598
Boy, you gotta wear this, all right?
Now! Don't do this to me.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.078
Jerome, come on.
Let's get suited up. It's game time.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.199
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.710
My pops in here tonight, though.
First time since high school.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.952
Then, I fouled out. In the first half.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.395
Man, he thinks I'm crazy
for chasing this dream.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.034
Don't worry about it.
You'll work it out on the court.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.549
-You'll make him proud, man.
-I hope so.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.598
All right, y'all.
Gather around and listen up.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.274
All right. Tonight's the night.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.835
We've been working hard
for this kind of exposure.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.589
We got the scouts out there,
we got the sponsors out there.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.513
And they're just looking
for the next one to make it.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.599
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you. These ain't
just a bunch of locals from an Open Run.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.832
This is the biggest streetball league
in the country.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.555
That's why this is our chance
to show the world...

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.234
...what streetball is really about.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.674
So all that...

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.071
...tension you got amongst yourselves,
it's time to squash it.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.155
Now, I want you to go out there tonight
with your game face on...

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.594
...Iike a team...

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.309
...and show the world and these people
what you are made of!

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.515
Are you with me?

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.557
-Yeah!
-All right!

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.589
Now here they come,
tonight's challengers...

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.151
...the Game On team, with their
star player, Jerome Jenkins Jr.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.358
Triple J! Triple J! Triple J!

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.511
Triple J! Triple J! Triple J!

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.037
Triple J! Triple J! Triple J!

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.159
And now, the number one
streetball team in the country...

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.788
...The Drop Squad.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.637
Let's go, guys. Let's hear it.
The Drop Squad in the house.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.677
Yeah!

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.076
All right, the two teams are taking
the court, ready to get it started.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.674
This should be an exciting game.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.319
-One more time, okay?
-Yes!

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.992
There he is. Yeah.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.714
Come on, man.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.269
Get it to Jerome!

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.559
That's right.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.835
Come on, now!

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.515
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.114
The Drop Squad in the house.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.311
Oh, no!

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.710
Take Jerome!

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.270
The Drop Squad has the lead,
and it looks like Ghost in the Machine...

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.238
...may have to change his name to
Toast in the Machine.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.993
The way Game On is playing...

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.550
...it's gonna take a miracle
to turn this game around.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.188
Come on, lucky sneakers.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.675
You know, there's one for Game On.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.512
This ball game has finally begun.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.552
Don't worry, Ghost.
I got your back.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.597
Oh, no!

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.876
We're seeing a strong
comeback from Game On...

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.955
...and Ghost in the Machine, with help
from Triple J, Jerome Jenkins Jr.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.834
Come on, come on!

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.149
Yes, yes!

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.354
Come on, ref!

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.752
All right. Let's just get
back to the game.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.871
Oh, no. Hey, hey!

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.234
These are for you.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.870
I appreciate your ailment, but could
we get a ref out here with some sight?

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.156
-I'm warning you.
-They're fouling my guy!

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.435
Come on. It's streetball.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.114
But you still gotta be able to see
in order to referee.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.352
-That's it! I'm fining you $100.
-A hundred dollars? You know what?

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.478
-Make it $200.
-You're out of here!

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.039
Now, get out!

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.113
It is all tied up, people.
It is a battle of wills.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.748
But we'll be back
after this short halftime break...

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.558
...to see how it all finishes up.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.950
That's what I'm talking about.
That's streetball.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.031
Y'all was looking great out there.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.919
-Way to handle it, Triple J.
-Yeah, we're coming back, baby.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.355
Way to go, Ghost.
Your dad's loving you out there.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.751
-Yeah, you did your thing, kid.
-I know. I can't believe it.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.595
Yo, thanks, little man.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.154
Don't even mention it, Ghost.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.075
That one was bigger than me.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.236
Yo, the locker room's for players only.
Get out of here.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.798
I'm sorry, y'all.
But those lines, they crazy long.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.439
-Come on, man.
-Right. You right.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.075
I'm sorry about that. Y'all keep doing
what you're doing, all right? Basketball!

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.678
All right, y'all. Get your shoes on.
Get your game face on.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.114
Let's get on back out there.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.556
Now, every loose ball,
every rebound, is ours.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.790
Get out there and show them
whose court it is.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.269
-Let's go! Hustle!
-Y'all ready to do this?

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.590
All right, let's hustle.
You know that, right?

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.435
We're doing this.
Let's go, baby. Come on.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.636
Where are my sneakers?

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.839
We got these guys, all right?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.513
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.511
Ready?

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.315
-Well done, Raymond.
-Nicely done. Thank you.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.268
Ask me to deliver, I deliver.
Look at him.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.515
Move along, Triple J.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.075
All right.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.712
Come on. Come on!

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.030
The second half
is just getting started...

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.910
...and this is not at all what I was
expecting from Game On's top player.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.999
Come on, Triple J.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.872
Hey, Jerome.
You feeling all right?

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.519
Come on.
Let's get in the game.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.910
We're seeing history
repeat itself with Triple J.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.995
Like father, like son. Looks like the air ball
does not fall far from the tree. Stacy.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.879
With all the buzz surrounding
Jerome Jenkins Jr...

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.477
...and his star-quality talent, I'd have to
say that he is underperforming tonight.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.917
Air ball! Air ball!

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.516
It is point game, and I don 't think even
Jerome Jenkins Jr...

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.955
... can turn this one around.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.788
That's game. Drop Squad takes it.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.917
Game On looked like the team
to beat in the first half...

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.117
... but with Jerome Jenkins Jr.
choking in the second half...

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.475
...they just couldn't catch up to win.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.828
Well, that about wraps it up
for us tonight, folks.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.118
The Drop Squad remain
the undefeated streetball champions.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.510
And from all of us at
Sports News Network...

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.069
...thanks for joining us
and we'll see you next time.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.113
Don't worry, kid.

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.032
You'll get them next time.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.948
No, this is it for me, coach.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.356
I had a good run. I'm done.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.192
You sure, Triple J?

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:02.794
It's just one game.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.790
No, it's more than that.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.113
I must have been an idiot,
seeing you as my ticket out.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.316
How did I not know that
you were gonna choke?

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.357
-It's in your DNA.
-It's your fault.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.670
You took my lucky shoes
and made me wear these.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.319
I signed a deal with those guys.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:45.471
The money was in the palm of my hands,
and you just blew it.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.794
I thought my mom had to approve
the deals you made.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.032
Your mom signed everything she had to
right here in this contract.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.237
It gave me full power over you,
1 00 percent of everything.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.197
But now you and this contract...

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.999
...ain't even worth the paper
it's printed on.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.036
-You played us?
-I'm a player, fool.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.873
That's what I do.
Busy trying to sell you to them suits.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.314
But it's a new day.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.278
Ray Thomkins represents
Ray Thomkins.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.158
I'm better than you anyway.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.594
I'd have never choked.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.831
-But we're family.
-Come on, Jerome.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.230
I'm your cousin's
ex-boyfriend's brother.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.515
It don't even count.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.959
It did to me.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.919
Where you been?
You should've been home hours ago.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.193
I had to take the bus home.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.874
-Why? Where's Ray?
-I don't know.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.116
I heard what happened at the game.
It's okay, honey.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.599
I'm done with basketball.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.513
-Wait a minute. Why?
-lt ruined my life.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.148
I embarrassed myself in front of
thousands of people.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.594
I let you and Daddy down.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.069
I lost two of my best friends,
and Ray betrayed me.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.991
What's the use?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.319
-This is Mr. Jenkins.
-Jerome, it's me.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.833
-Hey. How's he doing?
-Not so good.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.151
Yeah, I saw some highlights
from the game. It's not easy.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.313
I wanted to apologize about Ray.
You were totally right.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.914
Well, you always did tend
to see the best in people.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.798
This time, I sure was blind.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.157
He's gone for good now, though.
He came by last night, got his things.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.673
Don't beat yourself up.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.115
Listen, I really think
you should come by.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.555
Jerome needs you now
more than ever.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.393
He's talking about never
playing basketball again.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.275
-Really?
-Y es, really.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.555
Well, maybe that's good.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.917
You know, it won't break
his heart like it did mine.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.110
You know, yours wasn't
the only heart that was broken.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.595
-Summer's almost over.
-Yep.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.479
-Junior high this year.
-Yep.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.631
Are you scared?

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.997
-Nope.
-Yeah. Me neither.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.029
Nice shot.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.672
Man, you weren't in your spot.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.035
Yeah, a lot of change
since you've been gone.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.029
What are you doing here, anyway?
Taking a break from your adoring fans?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.910
I'm not sure how much
they adore me right now.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.878
So that's it? One bad game
and you wanna be our friend again?

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.715
It wasn't just one bad game.
It was a lot of bad decisions.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.872
I came by to apologize.
I acted like a real jerk, and I'm sorry.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.196
It's too late now.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.869
Well, I just wanted to let
you guys know I'm sorry...

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.712
...so I guess that's it.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.869
Maybe we'll come by and see you
at King of the Concrete tomorrow.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.634
-I decided not to play.
-What? Why?

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.030
-I'm done with basketball for good.
-You're automatically in the finals.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.589
And if you bring two players from
the Game On team...

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.159
...it's a guaranteed win.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.073
Isn't that your dream?
To get your name on the Ball of Fame?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.434
It was. But even if I wanted to play...

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.194
-...I don't have the magic sneakers.
-So?

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.273
I thought you could win that tournament
even before you found those sneakers.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.078
Yeah, I guess.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.196
Well, later.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.958
Later.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.839
I mean, why don't you
play just for fun.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.513
All right, look, man,
you're definitely looking better.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.238
But you're not following through.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.994
I mean, you're stopping here,
but you wanna be here.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.516
You gotta follow through with it.
And, Rodney, you're slapping the ball.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.399
I mean, you gotta use
your fingertips and-- Let me show you.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.152
Don't let your palm touch the ball.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.630
Use your fingertips and your wrists.
Throw the ball down to the ground.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.392
Whatever. If we wanted a lesson...

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.676
...we would've scheduled one
with your manager.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.592
Come on, Rod. Let's go.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.791
Fine. I'm just saying.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.838
If we're gonna win tomorrow,
y'all are gonna have to step up.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.550
-Wait a minute. You're picking us?
-Are you joking?

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.749
No.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.994
-You can pick anyone you want, right?
-I know. I just did.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.029
What do you say, Nathan?

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.714
Triple Threat back together again.
Could be good luck.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.235
Jordan did come back to Scottie and
the Bulls for another three championships.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.392
True, but then he played
for the Wizards.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.949
I thought you'd never
bring that up again.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.718
-Was that necessary?
-So how about it, Nathan?

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.392
You might not win
with us on your team.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.876
I don't know about that, but I know
I wouldn't wanna win without you.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.914
And if we lose,
at least we'll lose with style.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.114
Triple Threat on three.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.948
One, two, three, Triple Threat!

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.276
I can shoot from
three different spots now.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.590
Yeah, and I don't hum
when I shoot anymore.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.991
-Yes, you do.
-Yeah, but not as loud.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.639
Listen, we're gonna do great.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.155
Let's just go out there
and have fun, all right?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.833
Oh, man. I just realized.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.357
This is perfect timing,
because I got a new lucky charm.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.668
-Oh, my God.
-What is that?

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.559
It's a dried rattlesnake.
The lndians used it for good luck.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.836
Yeah, a lot of good it did them.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.319
Hey, guys.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.759
Jerome, I found these with some
of Ray's things. You still want them?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.592
Hey, guys.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.354
-Oh, my God.
-Rodney, what did you do to your hair?

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.472
Not Rodney anymore, fellas.
Double R now.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.154
-Rodney Rheingold.
-That's tight, man. You look good.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.878
I know.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.236
Well, sign your name, Double R.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.834
Oh, check it. He got the inside....

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.996
-That's tight. I'm gonna turn this in.
-All right. Let's go, man.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.757
Team Triple Threat checking in.
Thank you.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.834
Hey, team Triple Threat.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.595
You're not done yet. You need
to put down an alternate player.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.919
One game. Just one game. One.
That's all it is, one game.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.230
Relax, Rodney. Let's just have fun.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.472
Yeah, if you call getting beaten
like a stray dog fun.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.191
We're Team Ray-On,
and you boys are in for a world of pain.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.958
-Ray-On?
-Yeah.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.991
-Like the synthetic fabric?
-What?

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.073
No, like Game On, but with "Ray. "

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.239
Like Ray-On. Yeah.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.993
-Whatever.
-Whatever?

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.714
All right, well,
we'll see y'all in the finals.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.792
You see the cheetah skin?
I'm gonna be on you like a cheetah!

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.599
I'm gonna run you down!
Then I'm gonna bite your head off!

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.676
Cry. Cry.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.233
Don't let them scare you.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.317
-What are you guys doing here?
-Come on.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.590
-We came to watch y'all win.
-Thanks, guys.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.877
Just remember: it's not who's bigger
on the outside that matters.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.678
It's who's bigger on the inside.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.157
Good luck, boys. Jelly worm?

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.998
Sure.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.957
All right, then. Well, let's get it on.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.678
Welcome to the 34th annual...

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.957
...Sunset Beach
King of the Concrete competition.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.712
This year, we're excited to have...

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.077
...one of the greatest
basketball players from the NBA.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.549
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me welcome...

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.598
...Olympic Dream Team
gold medalist...

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.878
...Clyde "The Glide" Drexler!

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.029
Thank you.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.196
From parks to playgrounds...

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.112
...from the projects to the beaches...

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.675
...from the inner city
to the outer boroughs...

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.752
...this is where basketball was born:
on the street.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.638
You can watch the games on TV.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.758
You can follow your favorite teams
and your favorite players.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.277
Each and every player started shooting
hoops somewhere in their neighborhood.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.792
So go on. Keep getting out there
and having fun.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.757
Dream big and work hard.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.276
Because today we'll find out
who rules this court.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.754
Many teams come...

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.754
...but there will be only one who will
be called the Kings of the Concrete.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.035
Let's play ball.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.873
Hey!

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.919
Ray-On.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.917
Get off me.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.199
Yeah, yeah. What?

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.436
What? Alley-oop.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.753
Ray-On!

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.636
Come on. What you got?
What you got? Nothing.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.313
Give me the rock.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.630
Okay, people. It's time to find out...

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.268
...who's going to be the next
King of the Concrete.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.268
-Oh, my stomach hurts.
-I told you not to eat that hot dog.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.271
You told me not to eat
that second one.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.153
It was the third one
that upset my stomach.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.999
It's nerves. You'll be cool
once the game gets under way.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.269
I don't know, man.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.476
It's team Ray-On in the final round...

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.077
...against local wonder kid Jerome
Jenkins Jr. and his team, Triple Threat.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.748
All right. Come on, y'all.
Triple Threat on three.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.917
One, two, three, Triple Threat.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.559
Let's go.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.319
Ray-On's ball.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.472
The game's to 21.
Let's keep it clean, men.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.000
He smells your fear.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.390
-Come on, ref. Call something.
-Yeah, whatever.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.629
No, you didn't! No, you didn't!

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.758
Dude, are you all right?

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.195
Actually, I feel a lot better now.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.112
Cool. Let's play ball.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.434
Think you forgot something.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.878
Yo, J. New spot.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.872
Give me the ball.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.513
Okay, pick him up, Rod.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.397
-Hey, Nathan. He's humming.
-I was not.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.275
-Yeah, bro.
-Ray-On. Yeah.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.714
That's how we do it.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.757
Let's just keep playing hard, guys.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.918
I'm sorry.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.708
Ray-On, baby.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.399
Jerome, are you all right?

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.711
Oh no.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.356
What are we gonna do now?

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.391
Nathan, are you all right?

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.717
My ankle.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.957
-Can he go?
-I don't know. It doesn't look good.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.917
No, I can play.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.310
No, man. You did good.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.314
Guys, you got two minutes to bring in
an alternate or the game is forfeited.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.036
-Who did you put down as our alternate?
-My dad.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.760
It was wishful thinking.
It doesn't do us any good now.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.353
Not so fast.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.396
-Excuse me.
-Hey, that's Double J.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.039
Oh, my God.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.029
Dad? Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.636
Yeah, well, I'm thinking
maybe it's time for a career change.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.597
-ls this your alternate?
-Yeah.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.631
-No, this can't happen.
-Right here.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.950
Right here? What you talking about?
Let me see.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.429
That's not gonna work.
I don't like this roster.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.511
It looks official to me.
It's right here.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.875
You not official.
You got this at Foot Locker.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.312
Thanks, Nate.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.628
-You really wanna do this?
-Let's play.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.439
But, Jerome,
what about your lucky sneakers?

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.113
I don't need them now.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.838
Come on. Let's go.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.192
Need some help, old man?
See you forgot your walker. "I'm old. "

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.152
No, no. I'm good.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.279
Can't be too fast. It took you six months
just to get off my couch.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.959
Yeah!

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.117
Point game, gentlemen.
This one determines it.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.594
Put it up, Jerome.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.192
You got it. Shoot, shoot!

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.711
Jerome, the game
is supposed to be fun.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.151
Yeah! Yes!

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.835
Triple Threat.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.838
-You did it.
-Good game, okay?

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.397
Punk, get up. What you doing?
What's wrong with you?

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.353
I hit it from half-court.
I didn't even have the shoes on.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.512
For real, man.
But why didn't you dunk it, man?

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.035
-Jerome. Jerome, hey.
-Jerome. How you doing? Hey.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.431
-We're from Bullet Marketing.
-Do you have representation?

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.956
You guys wanted to discuss
something with Jerome?

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.196
-Are you his manager?
-I'm his father.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.713
Look, we know we can make
some serious marketing dollars.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.440
-For your son.
-lf you'd like to discuss some ideas.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.029
-Do you have any promotional plans?
-For the boy?

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.516
Yeah, we plan on sending him
to a great college in a couple years.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.436
Don't listen to that man.
I represent that boy.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.397
Jerome Jenkins?
I represent him.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.279
Look, I got it right here.
The contract, hold on.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.037
It says, "For all forms of media,
worldwide and in perpetuity...

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.031
...here, therefore, and forever more--"

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.392
Wait, it's more. Just hold on.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.154
It's right back here. I almost got it.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.833
I just gotta reach--

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.032
That's all right.
Why you putting the trunk on me?

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.397
Been wanting to do that
for a long time.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.152
-Nice.
-Nice.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.311
-Yeah.
-Good job too.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.472
That's some good shooting.
You might be ready for one-on-one.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.790
-Really?
-Yeah. You gotta take it easy on me.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.678
Okay, I'll take it easy on you.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.229
You're gonna have to,
the way you were playing.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.029
-So did you have fun today, son?
-Yeah, I had a great time.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.270
Well, you did it, kid.
King of the Concrete.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.873
-How does it feel?
-Amazing.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.789
-I couldn't have done it without you.
-I don't know. You had your game on.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.952
-You weren't bad yourself.
-Thank you, son. I appreciate that.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.159
Although if you use your knees more,
you might get more push off that shot.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.197
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.588
You teaching me now, huh?

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.479
Come here. Let me see the ball.
I'll show you how it's done.

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.630
Hello? Is anybody out there?

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.230
Hello?

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.073
A little help.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.754
Can anybody hear me?

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.233
Somebody, anybody?

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.036
Hey, hey, hey.
Who's shaking the car?

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.872
Is that an earthquake?

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.918
If you're not an earthquake,
answer me.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.957
Come on, please!

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.476
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.878
Cut. Print it.
