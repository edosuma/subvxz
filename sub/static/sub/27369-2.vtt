01:58.118 --> 02:00.746
I borrowed my Mom's car
to go get a pack of cigarettes

02:00.954 --> 02:02.664
and when I returned,

02:02.748 --> 02:05.667
Momma told me that the police had been
there looking for me.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.794
and I said "Well what for?"

02:07.878 --> 02:09.087
and she said, "Well,...

02:09.171 --> 02:12.549
"... something about that woman that
come up missing from that store out there"

02:15.594 --> 02:18.096
and she goes, "Well, they want to talk
to you for some reason."

02:18.347 --> 02:20.599
So I said, "Well, will you take
me down there?"

02:20.724 --> 02:22.934
So, my mom was going to
take me down there.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.646
We went out to the car, and started
to get in the car

02:25.771 --> 02:27.939
and started to back up
out of the drive way.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.817
and a police car pulled in
the drive way behind us.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.407
and they said, "Are you Tommy Ward?"

02:37.491 --> 02:39.076
and I said, "Yeah."

02:39.159 --> 02:44.498
They said, "Well, we had call ins saying
that, you lived in Ada all your life--

02:44.915 --> 02:49.127
and that you might know who it was that
took this woman from the store."

02:50.295 --> 02:54.549
and I said, "well, no." I said, "I've seen
them composite drawings on TV"

02:54.633 --> 02:57.135
I said, " they don't look like
nobody I know."

02:57.260 --> 03:00.514
and he goes, "Well, we've got some
better pictures at the police station..

03:00.681 --> 03:02.683
"...and we'd like for you to
come down here to look at--

03:02.849 --> 03:05.644
to see if you might know them because..."

03:05.769 --> 03:08.689
and he goes, "Would you help us out
if you do recognize them,

03:08.855 --> 03:10.857
you would tell us you know, who it is?"

03:11.191 --> 03:13.193
and I said, "yeah, sure"

03:15.237 --> 03:17.864
They took me downstairs to this basement,

03:18.073 --> 03:21.368
and they started asking me questions
about my whereabouts

03:22.077 --> 03:26.373
and then at that point, I mean they just
come at me and start saying,

03:26.498 --> 03:29.543
"You did it, you know you did it,
and this is how you did it."

03:29.668 --> 03:32.129
They kept on, and kept on, and kept on
at me at first

03:32.337 --> 03:34.339
I kept telling them "No, I didn't,
I didn't, I didn't."

03:34.715 --> 03:36.717
And they wouldn't take
"No, I didn't do it" for an answer

03:37.759 --> 03:41.221
They kept lying to me, lying to me,
lying to me

03:41.763 --> 03:44.766
then after a while,
they just got me to lying

03:47.227 --> 03:49.771
They sat there and kept telling me that

03:50.272 --> 03:53.108
more or less, more like,
"use your imagination"

03:54.067 --> 03:56.445
"What about your dream?"

04:09.750 --> 04:12.252
<i>-Did you kill this woman?</i>
<i>-No, I didn't.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:14.504
<i>I wouldn't kill nobody.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:17.048
<i>I wouldn't take nobody's life</i>
<i>from them.</i>

04:17.132 --> 04:19.384
<i>-Who killed this girl?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:20.719
<i>I have no idea.</i>

04:35.275 --> 04:39.279
I kept on telling them over and over
again, that I didn't do it,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.115
and he goes, "Well, if you didn't do it

04:42.199 --> 04:44.451
why would you flunk the test so bad?"

04:44.576 --> 04:48.038
I said, "I don't know," I said, "Look,
my nerves? I'm a nervous person,

04:48.163 --> 04:50.290
I've got bad nerves or something,
you know.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.501
and also, it could've been...

04:53.376 --> 04:57.047
The dream that I had after y'all come
talk to me the first time

04:57.130 --> 04:58.924
I had a dream."

04:59.007 --> 05:00.926
and then they were,
"Well about your dream?"

05:01.009 --> 05:03.011
you know, and that's when I told them
my dream story.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.599
I was sitting in this vehicle with--

05:08.058 --> 05:09.810
--and I remember

05:10.018 --> 05:14.773
like seeing like through the glass where I
seen like hands handing money to hands

05:16.066 --> 05:21.488
and then I had a flash in my dream, I seen
this guy kissing on this girl and

05:22.030 --> 05:25.575
she said, "Leave me alone"
and I said, "Leave her alone"

05:25.784 --> 05:28.078
and he said "Well if you don't like it
you can go home."

05:28.161 --> 05:30.288
and then I had a flash in my dream,

05:30.831 --> 05:35.085
and I was standing at the sink trying to
get something black off my arm.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.094
He goes "Your dreams don't make no sense."

05:44.219 --> 05:46.555
and I said, "Well like I said,
what dreams make sense?"

05:46.680 --> 05:49.182
"Y'all just sitting there asking me what
my dreams was about."

05:50.100 --> 05:53.478
<i>And then, he told me</i>
<i>that we had to get rid of her...</i>

05:54.271 --> 05:56.523
<i>and asked me a good place</i>
<i>to get rid of her.</i>

05:57.148 --> 06:00.986
<i>I told him about a house</i>
<i>and about this ditch down by the...</i>

06:02.821 --> 06:03.822
<i>Sandy River.</i>

06:04.614 --> 06:08.451
I thought they'd go out and
see it was lies

06:08.869 --> 06:10.871
that it was just a made up story.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.999
<i>Did Denise Haraway,</i>
<i>she begged y'all not to hurt her,</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:16.793
<i>or what did she say</i>
<i>when all this was happening?</i>

06:16.877 --> 06:19.963
<i>She was asking us just to let her go.</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:24.134
Well, I went in at
10 o'clock that morning...

06:25.385 --> 06:27.387
I think it was after 6 o'clock,

06:27.596 --> 06:32.267
it was late in the evening when they
turned the video tape on

06:32.893 --> 06:35.604
and I gave the bogus confession

13:04.659 --> 13:07.036
<i>Rusty Featherstone:</i>
<i>I've been down and read this case file,</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:09.414
<i>every interview,</i>
<i>everything that's in that file.</i>

13:10.415 --> 13:13.876
<i>And what there is a mention of,</i>
<i>quite often, is Ron Williamson.</i>

13:15.712 --> 13:17.046
<i>Where you live...</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:20.341
<i>I know it. That's what gets me, man.</i>

13:20.425 --> 13:23.303
<i>-You are a very good suspect.</i>
<i>-I know it.</i>

13:24.387 --> 13:25.513
<i>I'm just telling you.</i>

14:18.566 --> 14:21.402
<i>They are very concerned</i>
<i>that you are the one that did it.</i>

14:23.154 --> 14:26.574
<i>Don't you think they've got better things</i>
<i>to do than keep coming back on you?</i>

14:26.657 --> 14:28.284
<i>No, that's it.</i>

14:30.286 --> 14:33.498
<i>I'll tell you what, if that's</i>
<i>your opinion, you're sadly mistaken.</i>

14:34.207 --> 14:35.708
<i>I've read the reports.</i>

14:36.751 --> 14:40.588
<i>They seriously think that you're capable</i>
<i>of committing this type of crime, Ron.</i>

14:41.339 --> 14:42.840
<i>They're hoping that you didn't.</i>

14:44.884 --> 14:46.135
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

14:46.928 --> 14:50.640
<i>And if the allegations were to get</i>
<i>right again, the same guy's liable to...</i>

14:51.641 --> 14:52.558
<i>do it again.</i>

14:53.101 --> 14:55.311
<i>You know,</i>
<i>this scene doesn't look like the scene</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:59.899
<i>of a guy that goes around, you know,</i>
<i>pulling just your basic rapes.</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:34.308
<i>And this is their biggest concern</i>
<i>with you, with Ron,</i>

15:34.392 --> 15:37.311
<i>because with the history</i>
<i>of both of you...</i>

15:37.937 --> 15:41.357
<i>they feel like</i>
<i>it's a very strong possibility.</i>

15:42.024 --> 15:43.276
<i>Something went wrong.</i>

15:43.359 --> 15:47.071
<i>Either rejection, resistance, whatever...</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:50.491
<i>and somebody got killed.</i>

22:43.946 --> 22:44.780
<i>Judge John Miller: Mr. Williamson...?</i>

22:45.239 --> 22:46.782
<i>I knew you was going to say it.</i>

22:46.866 --> 22:49.618
<i>I' ain't never killed nobody.</i>
<i>I'm gonna prove it</i>

22:50.119 --> 22:51.495
<i>Judge John Miller: Lean him back.</i>

22:51.579 --> 22:53.581
<i>Just him there, hold him there.</i>

23:12.224 --> 23:14.685
<i>Judge John Miller: Mr. Williamson, any</i>
<i>further outbursts of anger,</i>

23:14.768 --> 23:16.687
<i>and this hearing will be conducted without</i>
<i>your presence.</i>

23:16.770 --> 23:17.771
<i>Ron Williamson: That's fine with me.</i>

23:17.855 --> 23:19.690
<i>Judge John Miller: This is your own</i>
<i>personal decision to waive...</i>

23:19.773 --> 23:21.191
<i>Ron Williamson: I said, I'm threatening!</i>

23:43.047 --> 23:46.300
<i>Judge John Miller: Court record will</i>
<i>reflect that Ron Williamson</i><i>attempted</i>

23:46.383 --> 23:48.469
<i>to overturn a table</i>

23:48.552 --> 23:51.513
<i>and go after the co-defendant</i>
<i>in this matter</i>

23:51.597 --> 23:54.433
<i>and had to be subdued</i>
<i>and escorted out of the court room.</i>

26:27.336 --> 26:28.378
<i>What can I say?</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:02.783
<i>Has there been any time...</i>

29:04.076 --> 29:06.662
<i>in your life, I think you said</i>
<i>something like that,</i>

29:06.745 --> 29:10.249
<i>that you have gotten mad enough at someone</i>
<i>where you wanted to kill them?</i>

29:10.332 --> 29:14.419
<i>Well, yes, there has,</i>
<i>the man that took my wife's life.</i>

29:15.170 --> 29:17.798
<i>And I wanted to kill the man.</i>

29:37.734 --> 29:41.613
<i>He was kind of talking crazy</i>
<i>that night, you know?</i>

29:41.697 --> 29:43.573
<i>Like talking about...</i>

29:44.866 --> 29:48.829
<i>how he didn't wanna live, you know,</i>
<i>and he didn't care to live no more.</i>

29:48.912 --> 29:50.747
<i>So he'd been drinking a lot.</i>

29:52.124 --> 29:53.041
<i>And...</i>

29:53.709 --> 29:56.378
<i>He passed this girl,</i>
<i>this girl passed on the street</i>

29:56.461 --> 30:00.007
<i>He said, "I'd like to rape her</i>
<i>and kill her.</i>

30:00.757 --> 30:03.635
<i>You know, like that." I said,</i>
<i>"What are you talking about?</i>

30:03.719 --> 30:05.721
<i>You are talking out of your mind."</i>

30:18.275 --> 30:20.986
<i>Did you find any pubic hairs...</i>

30:21.987 --> 30:23.405
<i>that match that of Dennis Fritz?</i>

30:23.780 --> 30:25.032
<i>Yes I did.</i>

30:25.115 --> 30:27.993
<i>I found one pubic hair from a washcloth.</i>

30:28.827 --> 30:30.787
<i>My opinion that it is consistent,</i>

30:31.371 --> 30:34.583
<i>microscopically with Dennis Fritz's</i>
<i>pubic hairs</i>

31:10.285 --> 31:12.621
<i>Bill Peterson: The defendant says,</i>
<i>"Just imagine this.</i>

31:13.622 --> 31:18.418
<i>When I was living in Tulsa, been drinking</i>
<i>and taking Quaaludes all day,</i>

31:18.502 --> 31:21.463
<i>then I drove to Coachlight,</i>
<i>and I drank some more.</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:22.964
<i>I got a little bit drunker.</i>

31:23.632 --> 31:25.467
<i>I ended up at Debbie Carter's door.</i>

31:25.550 --> 31:29.054
<i>Knocked on the door, and she said,</i>
<i>'Just a minute, I'm on the phone.'</i>

31:29.638 --> 31:32.432
<i>I burst in the door,</i>
<i>I raped and killed her."</i>

31:53.662 --> 31:56.540
<i>Bill Peterson: Look at Debbie Carter,</i>
and <i>tell me she didn't resist...</i>

31:57.332 --> 31:59.376
<i>with every fiber in her body.</i>

33:24.294 --> 33:27.797
<i>Bill Peterson: Question is who did it?</i>
<i>Who Killed Debbie Carter?</i>

33:28.507 --> 33:29.883
<i>Who killed Debbie Carter?</i>

33:30.634 --> 33:33.345
<i>The death was caused by the defendant.</i>

34:15.095 --> 34:18.598
<i>My neighbor that used to live</i>
<i>across the street from me, Roy Haynee,</i>

34:18.682 --> 34:21.184
<i>him, and what he introduced</i>
<i>as Ronnie Williamson</i>

34:21.268 --> 34:22.936
<i>came over to my house.</i>

34:23.019 --> 34:24.688
<i>It was on a Friday or Saturday night.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.732
<i>He said that-that the girls like me</i>
<i>should share themselves,</i>

34:27.816 --> 34:30.151
<i>and he told me</i>
<i>that he was going to fuck me.</i>

34:31.027 --> 34:33.196
<i>He hit me and he knocked me on the floor,</i>

34:33.280 --> 34:36.366
<i>And handling my breast, between my legs.</i>

34:36.449 --> 34:37.826
<i>He was very rough.</i>

34:38.868 --> 34:40.620
<i>I was screaming at first,</i>

34:42.330 --> 34:45.000
<i>And he kept telling me</i>
<i>that if I didn't do what he told me to do</i>

34:45.083 --> 34:46.751
<i>that he was gonna fuck me up.</i>

35:11.943 --> 35:13.945
<i>Andrea Hardcastle:</i>
<i>Ronnie was sitting on top of my chest</i>

35:14.029 --> 35:17.198
<i>and he said, "You know</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to kill you, don't you?"</i>

35:17.824 --> 35:19.034
<i>And I said, "Yes."</i>

35:20.035 --> 35:22.912
<i>And I had already made my peace with God</i>

35:22.996 --> 35:25.498
<i>and just hoped</i>
<i>that someone would find the kids.</i>

35:45.435 --> 35:47.771
<i>Bill Peterson:</i>
<i>On the night of December the 7th, 1982 ,</i>

35:47.854 --> 35:49.397
<i>did you have an occasion to see him?</i>

35:49.522 --> 35:50.523
<i>Glen Gore: Yes.</i>

35:50.982 --> 35:52.025
<i>Bill Peterson: Where was that?</i>

35:52.108 --> 35:53.610
<i>Glen Gore: It was at the Coachlight.</i>

35:53.693 --> 35:55.862
<i>I can't remember</i>
<i>who I was sitting there with us.</i>

35:55.945 --> 35:58.573
<i>Well anyway,</i>
<i>I went up to get me another drink</i>

35:58.657 --> 36:01.326
<i>and Debbie said,</i>
<i>"Glen, would you rescue me?"</i>

36:01.785 --> 36:03.870
<i>Saying he was bugging her so...</i>

36:04.704 --> 36:07.040
<i>me and her</i>
<i>went out on the dance floor.</i>

36:07.499 --> 36:09.417
<i>Do you know--did you hear...</i>

36:09.501 --> 36:12.837
<i>or do you know if Ron Williamson,</i>
<i>what he said to Mrs. Carter?</i>

36:12.921 --> 36:15.006
<i>No, I was just walking by.</i>

36:15.090 --> 36:17.926
<i>She tapped me on the shoulder,</i>
<i>said, "Save me."</i>

36:20.011 --> 36:22.972
<i>But you did see the</i>
<i>defendant Ron Williamson talking to her?</i>

36:23.056 --> 36:23.973
<i>Yes.</i>

36:45.453 --> 36:49.791
<i>Gary Rogers, agent with the Oklahoma State</i>
<i>Bureau of Investigation, testified that</i>

36:49.874 --> 36:53.503
<i>"Ron Williamson told him</i>
<i>and Rusty Featherstone</i>

36:53.586 --> 36:55.547
<i>that he dreamed</i>
<i>about killing Debbie Carter;</i>

36:55.630 --> 36:57.507
<i>that he was on her</i>
<i>with a cord around her neck.</i>

36:58.383 --> 37:02.512
<i>One of the agents asked him, "why?"</i>
<i>And he answered, "'She made me mad.'"</i>

37:03.805 --> 37:07.267
<i>Then the witnesses testified</i>
<i>who told you about...</i>

37:07.934 --> 37:12.188
<i>hearing Ron Williamson talk about his</i>
<i>involvement in Debbie Carter's death.</i>

37:12.564 --> 37:15.233
<i>Terri Holland was the first one of those.</i>

37:15.316 --> 37:18.820
<i>She heard him say</i>
<i>to someone out there in jail...</i>

37:20.238 --> 37:22.031
<i>"...he said he shoved a coke bottle</i>
<i>up her ass</i>

37:22.115 --> 37:23.783
<i>and her panties down her throat.</i>

37:24.784 --> 37:27.036
<i>And Mell Hett was the State's</i>
<i>last witness,</i>

37:27.120 --> 37:29.164
<i>who told you,</i>
who <i>tried to explain a little bit</i>

37:29.247 --> 37:31.207
<i>about the science of hair comparison</i>

37:31.291 --> 37:35.003
<i>and the results that can be</i>
<i>obtained from those kinds of test.</i>

37:35.086 --> 37:37.672
<i>He told you that there were two</i>
<i>on the bedding,</i>

37:37.756 --> 37:39.966
<i>on Debbie Carter's bedding,</i>
<i>two pubic hairs,</i>

37:40.800 --> 37:42.802
<i>two pubic hairs</i>
<i>consistent with those of Ron Williamson</i>

37:43.344 --> 37:46.139
<i>and that there were two head</i>
<i>or scalp hairs...</i>

37:46.222 --> 37:49.142
<i>on the washcloth taken</i>
<i>from Debbie Carter's mouth</i>

37:49.225 --> 37:52.395
<i>that were consistent with the head hairs</i>
<i>of Ronald Keith Williamson.</i>

37:55.815 --> 37:57.859
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</i>

37:57.942 --> 37:59.736
<i>you've heard all the evidence</i>
<i>in this case.</i>

38:01.488 --> 38:03.114
<i>The evidence is overwhelming.</i>

38:04.741 --> 38:06.159
