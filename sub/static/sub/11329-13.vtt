WEBVTT

00:02.835 --> 00:05.269
Thanks for the kiss.
It taught me a lot.

00:05.304 --> 00:07.438
Like what?
Like just because someone's

00:07.473 --> 00:09.674
sexually attracted to you doesn't
mean they really love you.

00:09.708 --> 00:11.342
I think Adrian and I
should get engaged.

00:11.377 --> 00:13.211
Not married, just engaged.

00:13.245 --> 00:15.213
I think it'll be nice,
especially for her,

00:15.247 --> 00:16.814
if people think
that we're engaged.

00:16.849 --> 00:19.317
Grace, you and Grant
aren't having sex, are you?

00:19.351 --> 00:20.651
I'm thinking about it.

00:20.686 --> 00:22.820
I don't want you
to have gateway sex.

00:22.855 --> 00:24.389
But, mom, I really like him.

00:24.423 --> 00:26.991
I should think you may be ready
to make a commitment.

00:27.026 --> 00:30.561
I just said I slept with another
woman after telling Amy I wouldn't.

00:30.596 --> 00:32.697
You wanna have a little fun?

00:32.731 --> 00:34.832
No. I don't do this anymore.

00:34.867 --> 00:38.536
One more time before the
girlfriend comes back home?

00:38.570 --> 00:40.838
Madison's dad isn't gonna
let us go out all summer.

00:40.873 --> 00:44.375
You can't stand the thought of my being with
someone else even though you have somebody else.

00:44.410 --> 00:45.743
I wanna do the right thing

00:45.778 --> 00:48.513
in case someday
you wanna get engaged.

00:48.547 --> 00:50.915
Friends?
Friends.

00:50.949 --> 00:52.550
What happened?
What are you doing here?

00:52.584 --> 00:54.852
More important to see you
before anything happens...

00:54.887 --> 00:56.354
anything that would
keep us apart.

01:03.228 --> 01:05.029
Hey.

01:06.398 --> 01:08.633
You didn't have to do that.
I had to do that.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.635
I know what they have to eat
on those flights.

01:10.669 --> 01:12.270
You have to be hungry.
It's almost 11:00.

01:12.304 --> 01:15.440
I should've just said
I'm starving. Thank you.

01:20.379 --> 01:21.879
You gonna have something, too?

01:21.914 --> 01:23.214
I'm not hungry.

01:23.248 --> 01:25.416
What'd you have for dinner?

01:25.451 --> 01:27.151
Same thing. Sandwich.

01:27.186 --> 01:28.653
I went over to my apartment

01:28.687 --> 01:30.555
and started getting things
ready to move back in,

01:30.589 --> 01:32.590
so I just had a sandwich
from the butcher shop.

01:32.624 --> 01:34.258
Oh?

01:34.293 --> 01:36.260
Yeah.
What do you mean, "oh?"

01:36.295 --> 01:38.096
Don't you believe me?

01:38.130 --> 01:41.399
Well, I believe you,
or I wanna believe you,

01:41.433 --> 01:43.401
but I just can't picture
what you'd be doing

01:43.435 --> 01:45.236
at your apartment
to get ready to move back in.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.705
Just stuff.
I cleaned up.

01:47.739 --> 01:51.609
I'm not over there every day,
so there was stuff to clean up.

01:51.643 --> 01:53.244
I see.

01:53.278 --> 01:54.979
I don't think you do see.

01:55.013 --> 01:56.914
What stuff was there
to clean up?

01:56.949 --> 01:58.249
What were you doing, dusting?

01:58.283 --> 01:59.951
I might've been.
I dust.

01:59.985 --> 02:01.085
Do you?

02:01.120 --> 02:03.321
Amy, I can't just hang out here

02:03.355 --> 02:05.123
all day and all night
with your family.

02:05.157 --> 02:08.158
I can't. I've done
the best I can, all right?

02:08.193 --> 02:10.895
And if you wanna accuse me
of having sex with another girl,

02:10.929 --> 02:12.463
just come out and say it.

02:12.498 --> 02:14.432
Just come out and say
what you're thinking.

02:14.466 --> 02:16.968
You know I've been working
on that the last few weeks.

02:17.002 --> 02:18.803
Yes, I know.
You told me.

02:24.309 --> 02:26.477
I've been listening
to all the teenage mothers

02:26.512 --> 02:28.679
and their stories about
how their boyfriends reacted

02:28.714 --> 02:30.715
once they decided
they wanted a real commitment

02:30.749 --> 02:32.116
and not just a promise
to help out.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.985
Well, I'm not their boyfriend.

02:34.019 --> 02:36.087
You're not even my boyfriend.

02:36.121 --> 02:40.358
I want you to be my boyfriend,
but you know that, so...

02:40.392 --> 02:43.427
What I'm thinking is

02:43.462 --> 02:45.429
maybe you went out and had sex

02:45.464 --> 02:47.131
with anyone you could
have sex with

02:47.166 --> 02:49.467
just because you knew you only
had a week until I got home.

02:49.501 --> 02:52.303
And maybe I didn't.
But I can if I want.

02:52.337 --> 02:53.804
Yeah, I guess.

02:53.839 --> 02:57.041
I didn't say I wasn't
gonna have sex with other girls.

02:57.075 --> 02:59.277
You said I'd have to quit
having sex with other girls

02:59.311 --> 03:01.112
if I wanna have sex with you.

03:01.146 --> 03:03.781
Maybe I don't wanna have sex with you.
No offense.

03:03.815 --> 03:07.485
Maybe I'm just not ready to be in
an exclusive relationship with you.

03:07.519 --> 03:10.221
I... I didn't say I was ready
to do that... just be with you.

03:10.255 --> 03:12.223
All right.
Maybe you're not, and maybe you are.

03:12.257 --> 03:13.958
Just keep your voice down.

03:13.992 --> 03:15.693
I don't wanna wake up
everyone in the house.

03:15.727 --> 03:19.030
Look, you're tired.
It's late.

03:19.097 --> 03:21.332
You go to bed, and I'll just
go home to my apartment.

03:26.672 --> 03:29.040
You wanna fit one more girl in
before we finish this discussion?

03:29.074 --> 03:30.875
How do you do it?

03:30.909 --> 03:33.077
How do you just go out
at midnight,

03:33.111 --> 03:34.412
or whatever time it is,

03:34.446 --> 03:37.515
and find some girl to go home
and have sex with you?

03:38.750 --> 03:40.084
Is that what you were gonna do?

03:40.118 --> 03:42.320
No. I was just gonna
go home and go to sleep,

03:42.354 --> 03:44.222
because I don't feel
like talking to you anymore.

03:44.256 --> 03:47.058
I should've known that weekend in
New York was too good to be true.

03:48.393 --> 03:50.595
I knew you'd run from me
the second either one of us

03:50.629 --> 03:52.363
showed any real feelings
toward the other one.

03:52.397 --> 03:55.499
I'm right here.
I'm not running.

03:55.534 --> 03:58.603
Not yet. But another five
minutes of this, and I will.

03:58.637 --> 04:00.905
I really don't feel
like talking about this.

04:00.939 --> 04:04.575
If you're not ready to be in an exclusive
relationship with me, that's fine.

04:04.610 --> 04:06.110
You're not ready.

04:06.144 --> 04:07.912
I'm ready for that kind
of relationship,

04:07.946 --> 04:11.415
but you're not,
so maybe we could just date.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.750
What do you mean?

04:12.784 --> 04:14.418
I mean date.

04:14.453 --> 04:17.053
You call me and ask me out
or I call you and ask you out,

04:17.089 --> 04:19.457
and we go to dinner
or go see a movie

04:19.491 --> 04:21.492
or you, me, and John
go to a circus.

04:21.526 --> 04:23.494
I don't really care
just as long as we're dating.

04:23.528 --> 04:24.829
I don't date, Amy.

04:24.863 --> 04:26.831
I'd rather join a circus
than date.

04:26.865 --> 04:30.434
Dating is what guys do when they're
trying to get a girl to have sex.

04:30.469 --> 04:32.870
I don't have to do that.

04:32.904 --> 04:34.639
You don't date?

04:34.673 --> 04:36.407
I don't date.

04:36.441 --> 04:39.076
You wouldn't date me
even if you thought dating me

04:39.111 --> 04:41.045
would eventually lead
to having sex with me?

04:41.079 --> 04:43.481
No, I wouldn't.

04:43.515 --> 04:45.650
I don't get it... dating.

04:45.684 --> 04:47.985
It's just a waste of time.

04:48.987 --> 04:50.121
Thanks.

04:50.155 --> 04:51.589
No problem.

05:27.192 --> 05:29.493
wanna stay over?

05:29.528 --> 05:32.496
I can't, Adrian.
Um, I have to go home.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.067
Do you ever think
about having sex with me?

05:39.070 --> 05:40.971
You're funny.

05:41.006 --> 05:43.107
You just had a scare
with the baby today.

05:43.141 --> 05:44.642
How can you even think
about having sex?

05:44.676 --> 05:45.976
I don't know.

05:46.011 --> 05:48.913
I'm just thinking about it
for some reason.

05:48.947 --> 05:50.815
Don't panic.
I don't mean tonight.

05:50.849 --> 05:52.783
I mean, sometime in the future.

05:53.852 --> 05:55.986
We could have sex again
if we wanted.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.689
Well, when my doctors
tell me it's safe again.

05:58.723 --> 06:01.459
When they say it's okay.

06:01.493 --> 06:03.461
I'm already pregnant, so...

06:03.495 --> 06:05.296
So I don't think
that your doctors

06:05.330 --> 06:07.064
would give you the okay
to have sex with me

06:07.098 --> 06:08.599
even if you weren't
having a baby.

06:08.633 --> 06:10.701
I mean, those guys
definitely don't like me,

06:10.735 --> 06:12.837
and I'm sure they don't want me
anywhere near you.

06:12.871 --> 06:15.473
And I'm sure that
your father doesn't, either.

06:15.507 --> 06:17.141
Not until there's a ring
on your finger.

06:17.175 --> 06:19.143
Well, your other finger.

06:19.177 --> 06:21.345
No, that's the right finger.

06:21.379 --> 06:23.180
But you know what I mean.
An engagement ring.

06:23.215 --> 06:25.749
And, besides,

06:25.784 --> 06:27.184
we're under doctor's orders
to grow up,

06:27.219 --> 06:28.919
and I'm not sure
that having sex

06:28.954 --> 06:30.287
just because you can't get
pregnant again

06:30.322 --> 06:31.489
is evidence that
we're growing up.

06:31.523 --> 06:34.391
Who knows
what a grown-up is?

06:34.426 --> 06:37.394
My doctors get to say whether or
not it's safe for me to have sex.

06:37.429 --> 06:39.063
They don't get to say
with whom.

06:39.097 --> 06:41.232
And my dad doesn't get
to say anything at all.

06:43.034 --> 06:45.503
I have to go, Adrian.

06:47.939 --> 06:49.240
Okay.

06:49.274 --> 06:50.875
Another night.

06:50.909 --> 06:52.543
Another night.

06:52.577 --> 06:56.380
And, um, let's make it
another night

06:56.414 --> 06:59.350
before Amy Juergens
gets back from New York.

06:59.384 --> 07:00.718
Why do you say that?

07:00.752 --> 07:03.087
I say that because

07:03.121 --> 07:05.022
if Amy comes back here

07:05.056 --> 07:06.957
and she gets into
a big fight with Ricky,

07:06.992 --> 07:09.894
and she decides she doesn't
want Ricky and does want you,

07:11.396 --> 07:13.631
you'll be gone.

07:13.665 --> 07:16.267
Of course,
I'll still have the ring.

07:17.369 --> 07:19.370
If that happens,
you can keep the ring.

07:20.572 --> 07:23.340
No, no. But that's
not going to happen.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.709
And even if it does happen,

07:25.744 --> 07:27.711
nothing that goes on
between Amy and Ricky

07:27.746 --> 07:29.547
is gonna change anything
between you and me.

07:29.581 --> 07:31.048
It could happen.

07:31.082 --> 07:32.716
In fact, it's likely to happen.

07:32.751 --> 07:34.485
Why?

07:34.519 --> 07:37.388
Because Amy doesn't understand Ricky
the way you understand Ricky?

07:37.422 --> 07:39.356
She doesn't.

07:40.825 --> 07:42.793
I have to go.
I'm tired,

07:42.827 --> 07:45.396
and I don't really care to hear
how well you know Ricky.

07:45.430 --> 07:46.931
Okay? Good night.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.535
Good night, Adrian.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.537
I'm happy that everything
worked out today

07:53.572 --> 07:55.606
with you and the baby.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.942
I'm happy that you're okay
and the baby's okay.

07:59.611 --> 08:02.746
But...Good night.

08:16.995 --> 08:19.430
We are not gonna have sex
under the king's roof.

08:19.464 --> 08:21.665
He'd never allow it.
He's not home.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.167
He might come home.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.736
Let's just get up
and get into our sleeping bags.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.638
I don't like
the sleeping bag arrangements.

08:27.672 --> 08:30.374
I think we're getting too old for it.
Don't you?

08:30.408 --> 08:32.142
We're gonna be juniors
in high school next year.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.144
We're never gonna get
too old for it.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.447
I love sleeping in the
sleeping bags in Ben's room.

08:36.481 --> 08:38.549
It's one of my
favorite things in life.

08:38.582 --> 08:41.217
It takes me back to the time
when we weren't having sex.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.620
We were young and innocent.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.659
We're still young and innocent.
Young maybe.

08:48.693 --> 08:50.594
What's so great
about being innocent?

08:50.629 --> 08:52.463
I like having sex with you.

08:52.497 --> 08:54.365
No. I love having sex
with you.

08:54.399 --> 08:55.799
Yeah, I know.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.801
And you?

08:57.836 --> 09:01.505
I love having sex with you.

09:01.539 --> 09:04.842
But how long will we love
having sex with each other?

09:04.876 --> 09:08.012
Forever. Or until
we graduate high school.

09:08.046 --> 09:09.480
Not funny.

09:09.514 --> 09:13.417
Maybe we can just sleep here
until Ben gets home.

09:13.451 --> 09:15.653
There's no harm in that...
in just sleeping.

09:15.687 --> 09:17.955
I guess not, especially
since we don't know

09:17.989 --> 09:19.556
if we'll be together
after high school.

09:19.591 --> 09:21.225
That was a joke, okay?

09:21.259 --> 09:23.494
You're going on vacation
with my family.

09:23.528 --> 09:24.995
You're in for life.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.131
And you're going
on vacation with my family,

09:27.165 --> 09:28.666
and it could be over for life.

09:34.406 --> 09:36.373
I love you, Alice.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.008
I love you, Henry.

09:43.515 --> 09:45.416
I think I heard a car door.

09:45.450 --> 09:48.419
Just one car door?
Yeah. Ben.

09:48.453 --> 09:51.021
Hey, throw the cover over us.
We'll surprise him.

09:51.056 --> 09:53.757
It'll be funny.
Okay.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.033
Surprise!

10:03.068 --> 10:04.868
What are you doing here?

10:04.903 --> 10:07.171
What are you doing there
in my bed? That's my bed.

10:07.205 --> 10:08.872
You told us
you'd be home hours ago.

10:08.907 --> 10:10.374
Yeah, okay.

10:10.408 --> 10:11.942
When I wasn't,
you devised a plan

10:11.976 --> 10:13.544
to kill me
by scaring me to death?

10:13.578 --> 10:15.212
Sorry. We thought
it'd be really funny,

10:15.246 --> 10:16.714
not that a lot of planning
went into it.

10:16.748 --> 10:18.382
Well, it wasn't.

10:18.416 --> 10:20.384
It was just scary.

10:20.418 --> 10:22.419
Just like the rest of my life.

10:22.454 --> 10:24.955
What's going on?
Is... is Adrian okay?

10:24.989 --> 10:27.157
Is the baby okay?
I thought she said everything was okay.

10:27.192 --> 10:30.094
It's not them.
It's... it's me.

10:30.128 --> 10:32.062
I think I might've
screwed up, again.

10:32.097 --> 10:34.064
What'd you do?

10:39.604 --> 10:41.905
Hey. What's going on?

10:41.940 --> 10:43.507
I just got home.

10:43.541 --> 10:45.442
I know. We pulled in
right behind you,

10:45.477 --> 10:47.377
but you took off up the stairs.

10:47.412 --> 10:48.746
Henry, Alice.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.047
Hi.

10:50.081 --> 10:51.415
I didn't see you.

10:51.449 --> 10:53.350
I was just focused
on getting up here.

10:53.384 --> 10:55.586
I wanna go to bed,
and I'm sure you do, too.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.921
So good night, dad.
You didn't see us?

10:57.956 --> 10:59.923
No. I swear.

10:59.958 --> 11:01.859
I just really
want to get to bed.

11:01.893 --> 11:04.762
I'm exhausted. It's been a long day.
Good night.

11:04.796 --> 11:07.197
Wait a minute.
Is everything okay with Adrian?

11:07.232 --> 11:09.466
Everything turned out
all right, right?

11:09.501 --> 11:11.401
Yeah, everything's fine.

11:11.436 --> 11:15.072
Um, she asked me to stay over, but
I thought I should come on home.

11:15.106 --> 11:16.607
So good night.

11:16.641 --> 11:20.577
What? Well, go back
over there if you want,

11:20.612 --> 11:22.246
if you think Adrian needs you.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.181
No. She's fine.

11:24.215 --> 11:26.617
Adrian really doesn't need anybody.
You know Adrian.

11:26.651 --> 11:28.685
Uh-huh.
Do you know Adrian?

11:28.720 --> 11:30.621
You sure she doesn't
need anyone?

11:30.655 --> 11:32.122
She doesn't need you tonight?

11:32.157 --> 11:34.057
She doesn't
need me tonight, no.

11:34.092 --> 11:36.593
She asked me to stay,
but she's fine.

11:36.628 --> 11:38.962
Yeah, well,

11:38.997 --> 11:42.499
anytime she needs you,
you be there for her, all right?

11:42.534 --> 11:44.168
Of course.

11:45.403 --> 11:48.438
So, uh, anything else
going on with you and Adrian?

11:48.473 --> 11:49.973
No, nothing else.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.510
Is anything going on
with you and Betty?

11:53.545 --> 11:56.547
Had a very nice night tonight,
Betty and me.

11:56.581 --> 11:59.817
I decided not to let you,
or Adrian and you,

11:59.851 --> 12:02.252
uh, take up too much
of our time tonight.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.555
Tonight was about us.

12:04.589 --> 12:07.357
Tomorrow we'll get around to you.
We'll talk tomorrow.

12:07.392 --> 12:09.993
Okay. Well,
until tomorrow then.

12:10.028 --> 12:12.429
Until tomorrow.

12:12.463 --> 12:15.165
Good night, Henry.
Good night, Alice.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.301
Good night, Mr. Boykewich.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.537
What did you do?

12:20.572 --> 12:22.806
I gave Adrian a ring.

12:24.142 --> 12:26.410
He told you not to do that,
and we told you not to do that.

12:26.444 --> 12:28.478
Only he told you if you did,
you're engaged.

12:28.513 --> 12:32.015
Yes, but it's not an engagement
ring, and we're not engaged.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.818
You just wanted her to have the ring
before Amy gets home, didn't you?

12:34.853 --> 12:37.154
What? No.
Giving Adrian a ring

12:37.188 --> 12:39.189
is not gonna make Amy
come back to you.

12:39.224 --> 12:40.858
That's not why I did it.

12:40.892 --> 12:42.860
I didn't give Adrian a ring
to make Amy jealous,

12:42.894 --> 12:45.195
and she didn't take that ring
to make Ricky jealous.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.864
So why did you give it to her?

12:46.898 --> 12:48.365
I don't know exactly.

12:48.399 --> 12:50.133
Why did Adrian take the ring?

12:50.168 --> 12:52.703
I don't think
she knows exactly.

12:52.737 --> 12:55.038
Uh-oh. I think I know.

12:55.073 --> 12:58.575
I think you might
care about her.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.344
Yeah. And maybe
she cares about Ben.

13:00.378 --> 13:03.513
We don't care about each other.
Not like that.

13:03.548 --> 13:06.049
Then like what?
Well, like we're having a baby.

13:06.084 --> 13:08.819
Every day, you get deeper
into this, my friend.

13:08.853 --> 13:10.888
If you're not careful,
you're gonna end up married.

13:10.922 --> 13:12.222
For real this time.

13:12.257 --> 13:14.725
You might just be right, Hank.

13:14.759 --> 13:16.226
This time, you might be right.

13:24.419 --> 13:25.919
From communicating
with Jack and Jesse.

13:25.953 --> 13:28.455
I mean, I'm sure there's
some way we can get to them.

13:28.489 --> 13:30.791
Yeah, I'm sure we can,
but we're not going to.

13:30.825 --> 13:32.292
We're on the honor system.

13:32.327 --> 13:34.261
We agreed
not to make phone calls

13:34.295 --> 13:36.630
or texts or e-mails
or anything else.

13:36.664 --> 13:40.267
Well, we didn't promise not to call,
text, or e-mail through a third party.

13:40.301 --> 13:41.968
You know how this works.

13:42.003 --> 13:43.637
If we go by the rules
for a while,

13:43.671 --> 13:46.139
our parents will probably
shorten our sentence.

13:46.174 --> 13:48.175
So just go by the rules
for once.

13:49.877 --> 13:51.478
This is so unfair.

13:51.512 --> 13:52.979
I feel like I'm in prison.

13:53.014 --> 13:55.716
Wait. No. On second thought,
if we were in prison,

13:55.750 --> 13:58.618
we would have better uniforms than what
we have to wear to the food court.

13:58.653 --> 14:02.356
Just do the time and
stop complaining about it.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.191
Complaining about it
only makes it worse.

14:04.225 --> 14:07.160
Yeah, it only makes it worse.
Hi, Jason.

14:07.195 --> 14:08.362
Hi, Madison.

14:08.396 --> 14:10.664
Good night.
Thanks for dropping by.

14:10.698 --> 14:13.533
All right. I'll leave.
Good night, Madison.

14:13.568 --> 14:15.135
So it's another summer
at med camp, huh?

14:15.169 --> 14:16.370
Uh, day after tomorrow.

14:16.404 --> 14:18.138
Good night.

14:18.172 --> 14:22.142
I saw your boyfriends
at the party. Good night.

14:22.176 --> 14:25.679
Wait, wait. Uh, what party?
What happened?

14:25.713 --> 14:27.381
Uh, who...
who were they there with?

14:27.415 --> 14:30.384
This could be a trap.
Don't break the rules.

14:30.418 --> 14:33.186
Well, it's not against the rules
to just ask about Jack and Jesse.

14:33.221 --> 14:34.888
Let me see. Uh,

14:34.922 --> 14:37.190
they were with each other
'cause they're both losers,

14:37.225 --> 14:40.260
and it was the football team-cheerleaders
"get to know you" party

14:40.294 --> 14:42.195
for the new team members
and the new cheerleaders.

14:42.230 --> 14:44.698
I think that's where
grace met Jack

14:44.732 --> 14:46.533
a couple years ago, isn't it?

14:46.567 --> 14:48.735
No, they met at church.

14:48.770 --> 14:51.371
Their first date
was at that party.

14:51.406 --> 14:53.206
What's your point?

14:53.241 --> 14:55.242
Yeah, what is your point,

14:55.276 --> 14:57.677
besides the fact that
you still haven't forgiven Jack

14:57.712 --> 14:59.246
for stealing Madison from you?

14:59.280 --> 15:01.248
Lauren, that's not true.

15:01.282 --> 15:04.384
I mean, Jason and I just weren't even
interested in each other, right?

15:04.419 --> 15:06.219
No, definitely not.

15:06.254 --> 15:08.388
And I don't have a point, okay?

15:08.423 --> 15:10.590
I just wanted
to say good night.

15:10.625 --> 15:13.927
Oh, I almost forgot.
Uh, Jesse wanted me to give you a message.

15:13.961 --> 15:17.564
But I know you're not supposed to get messages
from Jesse, so I won't give it to you.

15:17.598 --> 15:18.732
Wait.

15:20.401 --> 15:22.135
Do you know
what the message is?

15:22.170 --> 15:23.904
He said to tell you
he loves you.

15:25.406 --> 15:27.274
Oh, wait.
No, that wasn't it.

15:27.308 --> 15:29.576
He said hi.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.278
To tell you hi.

15:38.119 --> 15:40.954
This stinks.
That's what I'm talking about.

15:40.988 --> 15:42.589
I wanna see
what it's like up here.

15:42.623 --> 15:45.625
I haven't been up here since...
well, in a long time.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.094
Since dad died.

15:49.197 --> 15:52.098
Don't worry.
He's here.

15:52.133 --> 15:55.635
Dad's still here with us
in the guest house.

15:55.670 --> 15:58.839
Okay. Now that I'm
totally creeped out,

15:58.873 --> 16:01.475
I think I'll just
go back to where I was.

16:01.509 --> 16:03.443
I thought you meant
you're going home.

16:03.478 --> 16:05.445
No, I told you I'd stay here
till Jack got home.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.281
I'm fine. You don't
have to stay out here.

16:08.316 --> 16:09.783
I don't mind, really.

16:09.817 --> 16:11.117
I do mind.

16:11.152 --> 16:12.752
I'm tired.
I wanna go to bed.

16:12.787 --> 16:14.588
What time is Jack
supposed to be home?

16:14.622 --> 16:17.123
I don't know.
He doesn't have a curfew.

16:17.158 --> 16:19.793
Well, he left to go out
awfully late.

16:19.827 --> 16:20.994
Where is he?

16:21.028 --> 16:22.829
Who wants to know?

16:22.864 --> 16:25.632
Well, I imagine Madison
wants to know.

16:25.666 --> 16:27.834
I imagine she does.

16:27.869 --> 16:31.605
Does he have a date?
Is he dating 'cause he and Madison can't date?

16:31.639 --> 16:33.607
They were just forced
to break up.

16:33.641 --> 16:36.943
I can't imagine he'd be out
this soon, but that's Jack.

16:38.513 --> 16:40.847
Just tell me where he is.

16:40.882 --> 16:42.649
I'm not gonna pay you.

16:43.818 --> 16:45.318
Come on.
Just tell me who he's with.

16:45.353 --> 16:47.153
Twenty bucks!

16:47.188 --> 16:50.290
I don't have 20 bucks on me.
I'm in my pajamas.

16:50.324 --> 16:51.291
Go get it.

16:51.325 --> 16:52.292
Fine.

16:52.326 --> 16:53.793
You know, I change my mind.

16:53.828 --> 16:55.295
I don't wanna know where he is.

16:55.329 --> 16:56.796
Oh, yeah, you do.

16:56.831 --> 16:58.798
Oh, no, I don't.

16:58.833 --> 17:01.701
Wherever he is and whoever he's
with... it's none of my business.

17:01.736 --> 17:03.370
Not my problem.

17:03.404 --> 17:05.571
And I have to say,
it doesn't bother me

17:05.606 --> 17:08.074
if Madison spends the whole
summer worrying about Jack

17:08.108 --> 17:10.977
like I spent the whole summer
worrying about him last summer.

17:11.012 --> 17:13.646
And if he cheats on her,
who's gonna be surprised?

17:13.681 --> 17:16.348
Not me.

17:16.384 --> 17:18.318
Is he cheating on her already?

17:20.087 --> 17:21.721
Come on.
Just tell me where he is.

17:21.756 --> 17:23.656
At the party.

17:23.691 --> 17:25.925
That's where you two

17:25.960 --> 17:29.329
first got together.

17:29.363 --> 17:30.997
Oh.

17:33.534 --> 17:35.602
It's not that I still
care about grace.

17:35.636 --> 17:37.437
I just don't want
to see her get hurt.

17:37.471 --> 17:39.539
You just don't want her
to have sex with another guy.

17:39.574 --> 17:40.907
Yeah, that, too.

17:40.942 --> 17:42.509
I just wish she'd wait.

17:42.543 --> 17:45.045
Until you see if things
are gonna work out with Madison?

17:45.079 --> 17:48.815
Yeah, because I'm the only guy
grace has ever been with,

17:48.849 --> 17:51.217
and I'd like it
to just stay that way.

17:51.252 --> 17:53.053
Well, it's not
gonna stay that way.

17:53.087 --> 17:54.554
Sooner or later, grace bowman

17:54.589 --> 17:57.557
is gonna hook up
with some other guy, you know?

17:57.592 --> 18:00.727
And whether that guy is Grant
or some other guy...

18:00.761 --> 18:02.862
And you've been
with some other girls.

18:02.897 --> 18:04.764
And I'm sure you're gonna be
with some more girls.

18:04.799 --> 18:06.232
Maybe, maybe not.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.635
"Maybe not"?

18:08.669 --> 18:11.605
Do you really think that you're gonna be
with Madison for the rest of your life?

18:11.639 --> 18:13.673
I might.
No, you won't.

18:13.708 --> 18:16.710
Not unless you wanna stay here and
go to college. I could do that.

18:16.744 --> 18:19.079
Just to be with Madison.
I could.

18:19.113 --> 18:21.748
You could get into
a dozen out-of-state schools

18:21.782 --> 18:23.249
on a football scholarship,

18:23.284 --> 18:25.552
but you would stay here and go
to school because of Madison,

18:25.586 --> 18:27.487
who you're not even sure
you wanna be with,

18:27.521 --> 18:29.723
depending on grace
and what she does?

18:29.757 --> 18:31.558
Okay, that's enough.

18:31.592 --> 18:33.259
Let him know you're here.
This isn't nice.

18:33.294 --> 18:35.061
He isn't nice.

18:37.765 --> 18:40.033
Grace was my first love.
Our first date

18:40.067 --> 18:41.968
was at that party we were at
tonight... the football party.

18:42.003 --> 18:44.771
I wasn't gonna go,
but then coach called...

18:44.805 --> 18:47.574
you're the quarterback. You're the team captain.
You're supposed to be there.

18:47.608 --> 18:49.509
I was there.
Late.

18:49.543 --> 18:52.278
Well, it didn't seem right to be out
partying when Madison's at home.

18:52.313 --> 18:53.880
They couldn't go with us.

18:53.914 --> 18:55.982
It was just for the guys
and the cheerleaders.

18:56.017 --> 18:57.350
I know.

18:57.385 --> 19:00.453
But, still,
if grace were to have me back

19:00.488 --> 19:02.856
and she wanted to give it
one more shot,

19:02.890 --> 19:04.958
I think I'd have to
go back with her.

19:04.992 --> 19:06.426
She's not gonna do that.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.460
Probably not.

19:07.495 --> 19:09.462
Besides, even if she did,

19:09.497 --> 19:11.331
you're gonna be going off
to college in a year.

19:11.365 --> 19:13.299
Yeah, but I don't
have to go out of state.

19:13.334 --> 19:15.802
I can go in state. I was gonna go
in state anyway because of Madison.

19:15.836 --> 19:19.639
Deciding which college you go to
is an important decision.

19:19.674 --> 19:23.677
You can't decide which college
you go to based on a girl.

19:23.711 --> 19:25.278
Or two girls.

19:25.312 --> 19:27.113
Actually, I can.

19:31.919 --> 19:33.353
Is that grace?

19:34.889 --> 19:36.489
Hello?
<i>Hi.</i>

19:36.524 --> 19:38.692
Is it too late to call?
Are you in bed?

19:38.726 --> 19:39.693
I'm still out.

19:39.727 --> 19:41.628
You're still out
with your mother?

19:41.662 --> 19:44.330
You and your mother
are still out this late?

19:44.365 --> 19:46.866
Hello, grace.
Yes, it's me, Grant's mother.

19:46.901 --> 19:48.468
That's...
that's not your mother.

19:48.536 --> 19:50.136
You're not out
with your mother, are you?

19:50.171 --> 19:53.139
Well, grace, if you're not
gonna have sex with me,

19:53.174 --> 19:55.809
you know how it is.
 Stop it.

19:55.843 --> 19:57.877
<i>No, I don't.</i>
<i>How is it?</i>

19:57.912 --> 20:00.680
I'm just kidding around.
Yes, I'm out with my mother.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.683
We stopped on the way home to
have ice cream at the dairy shack

20:03.718 --> 20:06.386
just like we used to do
when I was a kid.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.888
And guess who's here.
Your ex-girlfriend?

20:08.923 --> 20:11.191
Your old boyfriend.

20:11.225 --> 20:14.828
Jack and Jesse are
sitting right behind us.

20:14.862 --> 20:17.597
I'll call you back.
Is it too late to call you back?

20:17.631 --> 20:19.065
<i>I hope not.</i>

20:20.534 --> 20:22.869
Jack's there.
Grant's gonna call me back.

20:24.371 --> 20:26.206
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Grant.

20:27.374 --> 20:29.576
So you're Jack,
grace's old boyfriend.

20:29.610 --> 20:31.578
I've been dying to meet you.
Grace, too.

20:31.612 --> 20:33.213
Only Grant
won't bring her over.

20:33.247 --> 20:36.382
This is my mother Carrie.
Oh. Nice to meet you.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.918
Nice to meet you.
Would you and your friend like to join us?

20:38.953 --> 20:42.188
Oh, that's very nice of you
to offer, but no, thank you.

20:42.223 --> 20:44.290
We were just leaving,
since apparently

20:44.325 --> 20:46.893
someone's been sitting here
listening to our conversation.

20:46.927 --> 20:48.762
Yeah, pretty much.

20:48.796 --> 20:51.898
Yeah. Well, good night.

20:51.932 --> 20:53.299
Good night.

21:01.876 --> 21:03.409
His mother.

21:03.444 --> 21:04.978
You gotta hand it to the guy.

21:05.012 --> 21:06.746
He's determined
to keep me away from grace.

21:06.781 --> 21:08.848
And why is that?

21:08.883 --> 21:11.317
You're not already
having sex with grace, are you?

21:11.352 --> 21:13.253
Not yet.
Maybe this summer.

21:13.287 --> 21:14.621
Maybe. I don't know.

21:14.655 --> 21:16.122
Okay.

21:16.157 --> 21:18.758
Well, take plenty of condoms
with you to med camp.

21:18.793 --> 21:21.561
That girl has
way too many pregnant friends.

21:21.595 --> 21:23.129
Just two.

21:23.164 --> 21:24.764
That's two too many.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.034
All right.
I'll be right back.

21:28.068 --> 21:30.003
Ask for the check, please.

21:37.978 --> 21:39.646
<i>Hi.</i>

21:39.680 --> 21:41.981
What are you doing up so late besides
waiting for me to call back?

21:42.016 --> 21:44.651
Oh, I'm just hanging out
in the guest house with Tom.

21:44.718 --> 21:46.152
He doesn't like
to be here alone.

21:46.187 --> 21:47.487
Liar.

21:47.521 --> 21:49.856
You're not just waiting
for Jack to come home?

21:49.890 --> 21:52.559
I ask because he told his friend
he's still interested in you,

21:52.626 --> 21:56.062
<i>so maybe you're</i>
<i>still interested in him.</i>

21:56.096 --> 21:58.798
And maybe you're still interested
in your old girlfriend?

21:58.833 --> 22:01.835
That wasn't exactly a no.
Are you?

22:01.869 --> 22:04.137
No, I'm not. We don't
let her live at our house

22:04.171 --> 22:06.172
so I can still see her
every day and every night.

22:08.209 --> 22:10.343
I really care about you, grace.

22:10.377 --> 22:12.145
We have an agreement.

22:12.179 --> 22:13.813
You're not gonna stomp
on my heart.

22:13.848 --> 22:16.382
No, I'm not gonna
stomp on your heart.

22:16.417 --> 22:18.384
I care about you, too.

22:18.419 --> 22:21.487
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Okay.

22:21.522 --> 22:24.390
And just so you know, I'm leaving
the guest house right now

22:24.425 --> 22:26.993
before Jack even gets home,
so I won't be talking to him.

22:27.027 --> 22:28.628
Thanks.

22:28.662 --> 22:31.164
I like that.
Good night.

22:31.198 --> 22:33.099
Good night.

22:43.944 --> 22:47.480
Good night, Mrs. calabash,

22:47.514 --> 22:49.515
wherever you are.

22:53.204 --> 22:55.272
I can't sleep.
I can.

22:55.306 --> 22:56.506
You can?

22:56.541 --> 22:59.710
Come on, Amy.
I knew I should've gone home.

23:01.145 --> 23:03.146
I just have to ask you
one thing.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.816
Can't it wait until morning?

23:05.850 --> 23:09.019
You know how you said maybe you
had sex with someone else?

23:09.053 --> 23:10.087
Did you?

23:10.121 --> 23:12.155
"Don't ask me about
my business, kay."

23:12.190 --> 23:13.156
What?

23:13.191 --> 23:14.658
"All right.

23:14.692 --> 23:17.794
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs."

23:17.829 --> 23:20.464
What are you talking about?
I feel like Michael Corleone

23:20.498 --> 23:22.532
when his wife, kay,
cornered him.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.768
Who?
<i>The godfather.</i>

23:24.802 --> 23:27.971
What godfather? The movie.
You've never seen <i>the godfather?</i>

23:28.006 --> 23:31.141
No. Then never mind.
Just go back to sleep.

23:31.175 --> 23:34.978
I just have to know.
Just tell me the truth. Did you?

23:36.180 --> 23:39.149
All right. I was gonna
tell you at some point anyway.

23:39.183 --> 23:41.652
So go ahead.
Tell me.

23:41.686 --> 23:44.221
Don't get upset.
I won't get upset.

23:44.255 --> 23:46.156
As long as you tell me the
truth, I won't get upset.

23:46.190 --> 23:48.191
I had a chance to,
but I didn't.

23:48.226 --> 23:50.694
Which doesn't mean I will never
have sex with anyone else again.

23:50.728 --> 23:53.697
So you haven't had sex with anyone
since you've been back from New York?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.835
Okay.
Thanks for telling me.

24:01.005 --> 24:02.205
Okay, but...

24:02.240 --> 24:03.774
no. No "buts."

24:03.808 --> 24:06.843
I don't wanna discuss this, especially
in the middle of the night.

24:06.878 --> 24:09.646
You've forgotten what it's like
getting up with John in the morning.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.048
Save your energy for that.

24:11.082 --> 24:13.483
Who did you have a chance
to have sex with?

24:13.518 --> 24:15.419
Was it Ashley?
No, not Ashley.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.354
You know I'd never
have sex with Ashley.

24:17.388 --> 24:19.056
No, of course not.

24:21.192 --> 24:23.360
I already told you
I'd never have sex with Ashley.

24:23.394 --> 24:24.995
We already talked about her.

24:25.029 --> 24:27.831
You know everything she ever said to
me and everything I ever said to her.

24:27.865 --> 24:29.633
Then who?
That's it, Amy.

24:29.667 --> 24:30.701
I can't take it anymore.

24:30.735 --> 24:32.269
That's the end
of the discussion.

24:32.303 --> 24:34.871
If you keep talking about this,
I'm going home.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.506
I'm really going home.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.041
Go back to sleep.

24:38.076 --> 24:40.844
Okay, okay.

24:40.878 --> 24:44.581
I won't talk about it anymore.

24:44.615 --> 24:46.817
Can I just take another guess?

24:46.851 --> 24:49.786
Please don't.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.989
Great.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.490
Good night, Amy.

24:53.524 --> 24:55.192
Good night, Ricky.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.797
Oh, great.
He probably heard you.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.733
He probably heard us.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.102
And are we gonna
get up and see about him,

25:05.136 --> 25:07.571
or will I be doing that?
Could you?

25:07.605 --> 25:10.073
Fine. I'll get him.

25:10.108 --> 25:13.643
Why shouldn't I get him?
I've been getting him for the past month.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.679
I've been getting him
for the past year.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.181
Bring him in here, okay?

25:18.216 --> 25:19.750
That's not a good idea.

25:19.784 --> 25:21.685
It's fine.
He's used to being in here.

25:21.719 --> 25:22.719
I like him in here.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.721
Well, I like to leave him
in the nursery.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.223
And it's better for him.

25:26.257 --> 25:29.826
He's not used to being in here
with the two of us.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.496
Great.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.798
So he thinks he knows best.

25:37.268 --> 25:39.269
Was that Robie
just a minute ago?

25:39.303 --> 25:41.538
No, not Robie.

25:41.572 --> 25:43.540
Are you sure?

25:43.574 --> 25:45.542
Yeah, I'm sure.

25:45.576 --> 25:47.711
What time is it?

25:47.745 --> 25:49.746
4:30.

25:51.282 --> 25:53.784
I had a dream
that Amy was home.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.652
Yeah, she's home.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.321
What?

25:59.457 --> 26:01.391
I heard her.
She and Ricky were talking.

26:01.426 --> 26:03.093
Kind of loud.
I think he left.

26:03.127 --> 26:05.095
Wait. What?

26:05.129 --> 26:07.464
I forgot to tell you.

26:07.498 --> 26:09.766
She called to find out
if she could change her flight.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.569
She didn't say she was coming home.
She just was thinking about it.

26:12.603 --> 26:15.138
It's a refundable ticket.
What... Amy's home?

26:15.173 --> 26:18.108
She's home early,
and you didn't even tell me?

26:18.142 --> 26:21.478
You were asleep, and when I saw
her, so was she and so was Ricky.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.681
I figured you'd find out
in the morning anyway.

26:24.715 --> 26:27.084
That my daughter
is home from New York early?

26:27.118 --> 26:28.618
Thanks a lot, George.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.688
I wanna know what
she's doing home early.

26:31.722 --> 26:32.722
Ask her.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.425
I will.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.470
Amy?

26:46.504 --> 26:47.838
Yeah?

26:49.841 --> 26:51.908
I'm so happy you're home.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.577
Why are you home?

26:53.611 --> 26:56.012
I missed John and Ricky,
and I wanted to see Ricky.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.715
Well, why is that?
Why'd you wanna see Ricky?

26:58.749 --> 27:00.517
You just saw Ricky.

27:00.551 --> 27:03.019
Did you have a fight with Ricky?
No.

27:03.054 --> 27:05.122
Well, you didn't just leave
that program early

27:05.156 --> 27:07.257
because you missed
John and Ricky.

27:07.291 --> 27:09.092
And by the way,

27:09.127 --> 27:12.195
didn't you miss me and your dad
and Ashley and Robie?

27:15.032 --> 27:17.634
Okay, Amy.
We'll talk in the morning.

27:17.668 --> 27:19.703
I'm happy you're home.

27:19.737 --> 27:21.705
I think.

27:21.739 --> 27:23.206
Yeah, me, too.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.509
Good night, Amy.

27:25.543 --> 27:26.810
Night.

27:26.844 --> 27:28.011
I love you.

27:28.045 --> 27:29.045
You, too.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.055
So you're still here.
You didn't go home?

27:39.090 --> 27:41.725
I'm here. But don't worry.
I'm going home.

27:41.759 --> 27:42.859
Now?

27:42.894 --> 27:44.394
When Amy gets up.

27:44.428 --> 27:45.729
I see.

27:45.763 --> 27:47.197
She asked me to stay.

27:47.231 --> 27:49.499
Oh, so of course
you had to stay.

27:49.534 --> 27:53.069
What's going on??
Why is she home early?

27:53.104 --> 27:54.738
She just wanted to come home.

27:54.772 --> 27:56.373
She said she was ready
to come home.

27:56.407 --> 27:57.774
And why is that?

27:57.808 --> 27:59.609
It's her home.

27:59.644 --> 28:00.744
Uh-huh.

28:00.778 --> 28:02.946
I was just checking on John.
He woke up.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.915
He's already
back to sleep, so...

28:04.949 --> 28:06.750
so you're just gonna go
back in there with Amy.

28:06.784 --> 28:08.251
I could sleep on the couch.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.921
That would be a lot more
comfortable and quieter.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.923
Quieter, huh?

28:12.957 --> 28:15.992
So you two were fighting.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.994
Let me guess.
You went out with some other girl.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.996
Or, rather, you slept
with another girl,

28:20.031 --> 28:21.831
and Amy felt like she had to
rush home to keep you

28:21.866 --> 28:23.633
from being with that girl
or with anyone else.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.735
She just wanted to come home.

28:25.770 --> 28:28.738
I don't think Amy's ever gonna be able
to stop you from being with other girls

28:28.773 --> 28:30.774
'cause that's just
the kind of guy you are, Ricky.

28:30.808 --> 28:33.143
And Amy's either gonna
have to live with that

28:33.177 --> 28:35.812
or you two are gonna have to
face the fact that despite John,

28:35.846 --> 28:38.615
you two really shouldn't be together,
because that's what life would be like.

28:38.649 --> 28:41.484
And yet, you're about to
get remarried to your husband.

28:45.957 --> 28:49.292
Good night.
I'll be in the living room.

29:50.688 --> 29:52.021
Oh, no.

29:53.157 --> 29:54.924
You could've just
stuck your head in

29:54.959 --> 29:57.026
and told me you weren't
coming back to my room.

29:57.061 --> 29:58.528
Your mother met me
in the hallway.

29:58.562 --> 30:01.030
She didn't really want me
to come back in your room.

30:01.065 --> 30:03.233
I've managed to survive here
for the past month

30:03.267 --> 30:06.269
without getting on anyone's bad
side except for maybe Ashley's,

30:06.303 --> 30:08.405
so I came in here.

30:08.439 --> 30:10.874
Please, Amy, would you just
let me get some sleep?

30:10.908 --> 30:12.342
You just got home.

30:12.376 --> 30:15.111
We got all summer to talk to each
other, to be with each other.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.880
You're right.

30:20.484 --> 30:23.253
Who was it?
Just tell me who it was.

30:23.287 --> 30:25.588
If you weren't gonna tell me who it was,
you shouldn't have brought it up.

30:25.623 --> 30:27.757
I didn't bring it up.
You brought it up.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.059
Okay, fine. I brought it up.
Who was it?

30:30.094 --> 30:31.795
It was someone
you don't know, all right?

30:31.829 --> 30:33.296
Really? It was someone
I don't know?

30:33.330 --> 30:35.298
Yeah, it was someone
you don't know,

30:35.332 --> 30:37.600
so don't start guessing a list
of names here, all right?

30:37.635 --> 30:39.302
Are you sure it was someone
I don't know?

30:40.604 --> 30:42.272
Maybe you're lying about that.

30:42.306 --> 30:44.307
Maybe. Maybe I'm lying.

30:44.341 --> 30:46.609
And maybe I slept with
another girl or two

30:46.644 --> 30:49.212
or three or four,
and you know all of them.

30:49.246 --> 30:52.449
No, I believe you... that you got
the opportunity but didn't.

30:54.819 --> 30:58.621
I'm just trying to think of who you had
the opportunity to sleep with but didn't.

31:00.324 --> 31:01.791
Was it Adrian?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.594
Was it Adrian? Was it?

31:04.628 --> 31:06.930
What the... Adrian?

31:06.964 --> 31:09.799
I don't even talk to Adrian,
and Adrian's having a baby.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.968
You can still have sex
if you're having a baby.

31:12.002 --> 31:14.971
I would have sex with Adrian
while she's having Ben's baby?

31:15.005 --> 31:16.906
She might've offered,

31:16.941 --> 31:20.443
and that's a situation which you
might've turned down, if offered.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.946
I can't believe
you're telling Adrian

31:22.980 --> 31:25.615
you wanna be friends with her when you
don't think any more of her than that.

31:25.649 --> 31:28.818
I didn't really have
these thoughts about Adrian...

31:28.853 --> 31:33.356
you and adrian... until tonight
when you said you turned down sex.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.792
So... so, when are you gonna see Ben?

31:35.826 --> 31:37.794
Maybe he'll offer
to have sex with you,

31:37.828 --> 31:39.829
and you can turn him down,
and then we can be even.

31:39.864 --> 31:42.031
I don't know when
I'm going to see Ben.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.500
I do plan on seeing him, but...

31:43.534 --> 31:45.735
but you were waiting to see
how things go with me first?

31:45.769 --> 31:47.504
You were waiting to see
if Adrian and I

31:47.538 --> 31:49.506
had been sneaking around
behind your backs?

31:49.540 --> 31:51.674
Jeez, I can't believe
you would think that.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.310
I was wrong.

31:54.345 --> 31:57.013
I don't think it was out of the
question, but I was wrong.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.218
I would never get in the way
of Ben having a relationship

32:02.253 --> 32:04.721
with the woman
he's having a baby with.

32:04.755 --> 32:07.857
He needs to be
with Adrian right now.

32:07.892 --> 32:10.460
Now? What about later?

32:11.729 --> 32:14.030
I doubt that he and Adrian
will end up together.

32:14.064 --> 32:15.198
Because?

32:15.232 --> 32:16.566
Because.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.835
Because Adrian's not
good enough for Ben?

32:18.869 --> 32:21.137
I didn't say that.
That's what you think...

32:21.171 --> 32:22.639
that she's not
good enough for him

32:22.673 --> 32:24.574
because he's such a nice guy,

32:24.608 --> 32:27.110
and he would never get involved
with a girl like Adrian.

32:27.144 --> 32:30.013
I did not say that.
She's a nice girl... Adrian.

32:30.047 --> 32:32.815
I know.
No, you don't know.

32:32.850 --> 32:35.818
You're being nice to her,
but be honest here.

32:35.853 --> 32:37.820
You think it was lousy
of her to seduce Ben,

32:37.855 --> 32:41.190
and you feel badly for him
that she got pregnant.

32:41.225 --> 32:44.294
I don't think there was a whole
lot of seduction going on.

32:44.328 --> 32:46.129
He wasn't just friends
with Adrian

32:46.163 --> 32:47.997
to be friends with Adrian.

32:48.032 --> 32:50.567
He was curious about sex
with Adrian all along

32:50.601 --> 32:52.769
because he's attracted to her.

32:52.803 --> 32:55.038
So when he got his chance,
he took it,

32:55.072 --> 32:58.508
whether he cared anything
at all about her or not.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.310
And let me tell
you something, Amy.

33:00.344 --> 33:01.444
When he does get to know her,

33:01.478 --> 33:04.147
when he does find out
how smart she is

33:04.181 --> 33:06.282
and what a big heart she has,

33:06.317 --> 33:08.217
he might just fall in love
with her.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.919
And he might've anyway,
baby or not.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.621
I doubt it.

33:11.689 --> 33:13.523
Are you planning
to use this time

33:13.557 --> 33:16.392
while Ben's with Adrian
as some experiment?

33:16.427 --> 33:19.696
You know, a time to find out if
we're really meant for each other

33:19.730 --> 33:21.698
so that if we're not,

33:21.732 --> 33:23.366
when Ben and Adrian's
baby gets here

33:23.400 --> 33:25.234
and all hell breaks loose
a couple months into it,

33:25.269 --> 33:27.070
you'll know whether or not
you'd rather be with him?

33:27.104 --> 33:30.540
No! This has nothing to do with
them... with Ben and Adrian.

33:30.574 --> 33:33.843
This is about us.

33:33.877 --> 33:35.144
I want this summer

33:35.179 --> 33:37.246
to be our time to get
to know each other

33:37.281 --> 33:40.583
and to see if there's any chance
we can actually be a couple

33:40.618 --> 33:43.319
and actually get married
in the distant future

33:43.354 --> 33:46.255
and be a family...
the three of us.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.324
I have a difficult
time believing

33:48.359 --> 33:51.394
that whatever our feelings are
for Ben and Adrian...

33:51.428 --> 33:53.596
that those feelings
don't have something to do

33:53.631 --> 33:56.799
with everything going on
with us right now.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.435
And I also have
a difficult time believing

33:59.470 --> 34:02.105
that going to movies
and going out to dinner

34:02.139 --> 34:04.240
and taking John to the circus

34:04.274 --> 34:06.643
would help us decide what our
feelings are for each other

34:06.677 --> 34:09.277
and whether or not we wanna be
together the rest of our lives.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.313
But that's what
people do, okay?

34:11.348 --> 34:14.183
They go out. They talk.
They get to know each other.

34:14.217 --> 34:15.885
They... they fall in love,

34:15.918 --> 34:18.286
and then they get married...
Sometimes.

34:20.290 --> 34:23.059
I want that.

34:23.092 --> 34:26.295
And while we're going out
and talking

34:26.330 --> 34:28.297
and getting to know each other

34:28.331 --> 34:30.967
and falling in love,

34:33.670 --> 34:36.005
I wanna graduate high school,

34:36.040 --> 34:39.842
and I wanna graduate college
and start a career.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.212
I wanna be a teacher.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.782
I wanna teach girls
to believe in themselves,

34:45.815 --> 34:48.051
because I believe in myself.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.655
I believe I can be
a good teacher

34:52.690 --> 34:55.858
and a good mother

34:55.893 --> 34:58.661
and a good wife to you,
someday.

35:23.378 --> 35:26.146
Grace, your phone's beeping.

35:26.181 --> 35:28.182
I think you have messages
or something.

35:28.216 --> 35:30.884
That's okay.
I'll just check them later.

35:30.919 --> 35:32.820
I'm gonna go home, all right?

35:32.854 --> 35:34.388
Tell your mom thanks
for inviting me over.

35:34.422 --> 35:37.091
She didn't invite you.
I invited you.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.892
She just let you come over.

35:38.927 --> 35:41.095
Maybe next time
she'll let me sleep with you.

35:41.129 --> 35:43.430
Don't bet on it.

35:43.465 --> 35:45.099
Okay. I won't bet on it.

35:45.133 --> 35:46.800
It was fun
having you sleep here.

35:46.835 --> 35:49.603
I just can't figure out
why she let you

35:49.638 --> 35:51.772
actually come over here
in the middle of the night.

35:51.806 --> 35:54.675
Why not?
Why not?

35:54.709 --> 35:57.244
I mean, she's made it pretty clear
that she doesn't want us to have sex,

35:57.279 --> 35:59.580
but then she lets you
sleep in my room?

36:01.149 --> 36:03.417
Oh, no. I hope
she's not up to something.

36:03.451 --> 36:06.487
She's not up to anything.
She trusts us.

36:06.521 --> 36:09.123
She trusts me anyway.

36:10.125 --> 36:12.293
See you later.
I'll call you.

36:12.327 --> 36:15.496
Tell your mom I said hello.
I'm really looking forward to meeting her.

36:15.530 --> 36:17.398
I'll introduce you.

36:17.432 --> 36:20.200
She's a very special person...
my mom...

36:20.235 --> 36:23.937
and way too involved in my life,
so let's just wait until,

36:23.972 --> 36:27.007
you know, you know you like me.

36:27.042 --> 36:29.176
I like you.

36:30.645 --> 36:32.579
Where's your dad, by the way?

36:32.614 --> 36:34.014
He's...

36:35.250 --> 36:36.517
Long story.

36:36.551 --> 36:38.285
I'll tell you about it
some other time.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.021
It's nothing bad.
He's around.

36:41.056 --> 36:42.189
Okay.

36:43.825 --> 36:46.260
Okay, see you.
See you.

36:52.267 --> 36:54.535
She's up to something.

37:08.216 --> 37:10.918
Okay, you gotta go home.
What?

37:10.952 --> 37:13.954
You've gotta go home.
I've gotta get up and get my day going.

37:13.988 --> 37:16.490
Oh, so much for sleeping over.

37:16.524 --> 37:18.359
Being close and all that, huh?

37:18.393 --> 37:20.210
Yeah. It's not me.

37:20.245 --> 37:23.781
Then who was it
that I was with last night?

37:23.815 --> 37:25.783
Go home.

37:25.817 --> 37:27.551
Okay.

37:30.755 --> 37:33.424
I've got to talk to my
dad about giving you that ring.

37:33.458 --> 37:34.725
I'm sure he knows.

37:34.759 --> 37:37.494
Oh, yeah. The ring.
I forgot all about the ring.

37:37.529 --> 37:40.330
Already?
It's like a dream or something.

37:40.365 --> 37:42.433
Only better 'cause it's real.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.968
I can't wait to show grace
and my parents

37:45.003 --> 37:46.904
and everyone I know,
or don't know.

37:46.938 --> 37:48.806
Okay. Well,
when you show it to them,

37:48.840 --> 37:51.642
please make it clear that
it's not an engagement ring.

37:51.676 --> 37:54.178
If we say it's an engagement
ring, then we're in trouble.

37:54.212 --> 37:56.080
You're in trouble, not me.

37:56.114 --> 37:58.949
Okay, I'm in trouble.
It's not an engagement ring.

37:58.983 --> 38:00.617
I know.

38:01.653 --> 38:03.287
Get up, bedhead.

38:03.321 --> 38:04.922
I always have bedhead.

38:04.956 --> 38:07.057
It's worse if I shower
right before I go to bed.

38:07.092 --> 38:10.727
It's cute. I like when
you're not so perfect.

38:10.762 --> 38:13.297
Which is most of the time, right?

38:13.331 --> 38:16.633
No, most of the time
you are perfect.

38:16.668 --> 38:18.168
Too perfect for me.

38:18.203 --> 38:21.805
Adrian, I am not too perfect,

38:21.840 --> 38:23.941
especially for you.

38:23.975 --> 38:26.844
In fact, I don't even know
if I feel worthy of you.

38:26.878 --> 38:28.779
What are you talking about?

38:28.813 --> 38:30.881
You're just so...

38:30.915 --> 38:34.284
Full of life and...Fun

38:34.319 --> 38:36.820
and crazy and carefree

38:36.855 --> 38:39.389
and...Beautiful,

38:39.424 --> 38:41.325
and I'm not.

38:41.359 --> 38:43.894
But you're very confident

38:43.928 --> 38:47.898
and considerate and...Just
such an honorable person.

38:47.932 --> 38:51.902
You have dignity...
real dignity, Ben.

38:51.936 --> 38:54.004
Oh, at least
when your hair is combed.

38:55.473 --> 38:57.973
I really appreciate
you standing by me like this,

38:58.626 --> 39:01.028
and I hope you continue
to do that...

39:01.062 --> 39:03.964
to stand by me even when Amy
comes back from New York.

39:03.998 --> 39:07.100
And I think it's really nice
that she called me

39:07.135 --> 39:09.369
and that she's offering
to be my friend,

39:09.404 --> 39:11.205
but, well,

39:11.239 --> 39:14.675
I have to say,
I really didn't miss her.

39:14.709 --> 39:17.678
I'm happy that she's been away

39:17.712 --> 39:21.548
and that we've had this time
together without her around.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.485
And I know that you just can't
wait to talk to her face-to-face,

39:24.519 --> 39:28.121
but I think it was
kind of a blessing in disguise

39:28.156 --> 39:30.991
that she went away and that
she wasn't talking to you.

39:32.527 --> 39:35.996
It gave us a chance to talk
to each other... you and me.

39:38.066 --> 39:40.033
Um, I'll call you later.

39:40.068 --> 39:42.102
And if you have
any problems today,

39:42.136 --> 39:44.905
do not go to the hospital
again by yourself, okay?

39:44.939 --> 39:46.206
Okay.

39:46.241 --> 39:47.908
Bye.

39:47.942 --> 39:49.810
Bye.

39:49.844 --> 39:53.847
Ooh. I'm starting
to get a little bump.

39:53.882 --> 39:55.716
Yeah.

39:57.852 --> 39:59.453
Bye.

40:14.402 --> 40:16.737
Oh, look.
My two boys are here.

40:16.771 --> 40:19.273
Good morning, John.

40:19.307 --> 40:22.209
Good morning, Ricky.

40:22.243 --> 40:24.545
You put me through hell
last night.

40:24.579 --> 40:26.914
Don't say that in front of your son.
He might repeat it.

40:26.948 --> 40:28.582
I'm gonna go home now.

40:28.616 --> 40:30.350
Can't you stay
and have breakfast?

40:30.385 --> 40:33.353
No, I can't.
I have to work today.

40:33.388 --> 40:35.055
You want me to drop John off?

40:35.089 --> 40:37.224
No. I'm gonna keep him
with me today.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.527
I wanna spend some time
with him.

40:40.562 --> 40:42.262
I really missed him.
Okay.

40:42.297 --> 40:45.198
Well, bye, Amy.

40:45.233 --> 40:46.916
It's been nice being here,
kind of.

40:48.286 --> 40:50.454
Thank you for doing this.

40:50.488 --> 40:52.523
Thank you for letting me
go to New York

40:52.557 --> 40:54.458
and being with John.

40:54.492 --> 40:56.393
You're welcome.

40:57.996 --> 40:59.430
I'll call you later.

40:59.464 --> 41:01.632
Great. I'll look forward
to hearing from you.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.602
That sounds kind
of formal, don't you think,

41:04.636 --> 41:06.403
for two people who have a son?

41:06.438 --> 41:09.073
Well, I just thought it sounded polite.

41:12.444 --> 41:14.678
Is there something else
you wanted?

41:14.713 --> 41:17.414
Something you wanted to ask me?

41:20.385 --> 41:22.486
Would you and John
like to go out with me tonight?

41:22.520 --> 41:24.254
We would love to.

41:24.289 --> 41:26.390
What time will you
be picking us up?

41:28.026 --> 41:29.560
Or we could pick you up.

41:29.594 --> 41:32.062
That's less date-like.
Mmm.

41:32.097 --> 41:34.531
I'll see you around 7.
