00:00.415 --> 00:02.289
Previously on Criminal Minds.

00:02.815 --> 00:05.150
Police in Dayton Ohio need our help
with a serial rapist.

00:05.155 --> 00:07.117
He was waiting for them
when they got home.

00:10.055 --> 00:11.717
We need a female undercover.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.801
- Do you think Elle's ready for it ?
- I'm good.

00:16.415 --> 00:18.060
What's she doing
with her gun out ?

00:19.075 --> 00:20.849
- She's panicking.
- Easy, esay

00:21.005 --> 00:22.208
FBI !

00:22.405 --> 00:24.808
Get out of the car,
get on the ground !

00:24.818 --> 00:26.640
- I was just checking my...
- Shut up !

00:27.593 --> 00:29.945
I was just stopping
to look at my map.

00:31.290 --> 00:33.097
Don't say another word.

00:35.241 --> 00:37.737
- You're letting him walk ?
- The only reason he's walking

00:37.749 --> 00:38.940
is because you panicked.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.462
I'm supposed to believe
that you've got my back.

00:41.476 --> 00:44.161
The last time you sent me home,
Hotch, you got me shot.

00:45.626 --> 00:47.690
You've made a lot of women
very happy.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.861
I didn't let you walk.

00:49.876 --> 00:50.990
Thank you.

00:55.457 --> 00:56.773
Hey Lee.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.386 --> 01:16.833
I got you message.

01:17.276 --> 01:18.492
Close the door.

01:23.296 --> 01:25.662
This is William Lee's case file.
Sit down.

01:31.605 --> 01:34.453
The Bureau has concluded
its internal investigation.

01:34.777 --> 01:37.873
And they accept your claim that you went
to Lee's house to confront him.

01:38.546 --> 01:40.980
And that you defended yourself
when he attacked.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.851
As your supervising agent, I've ordered
a psychological status report.

01:47.768 --> 01:49.780
After the Bureau's cleared me ?

01:50.678 --> 01:52.112
I don't need a shrink Hotch.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.203
That's up to me
to make that assesment.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.933
You think I'm lying.

01:59.155 --> 02:00.771
You know you're not
a prosecutor anymore.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.362
You're the only one who knows
what really happened that night.

02:03.376 --> 02:05.170
And I think you need to be honest
with yourself

02:05.176 --> 02:07.371
since you've got to live with
for the rest of your life.

02:07.685 --> 02:09.880
I appreciate your concern.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.211
- I'm fine
- Are you ?

02:12.218 --> 02:13.990
- Yeah.
- You're anxious,

02:14.005 --> 02:15.772
you're on edge, unnoticed.

02:15.776 --> 02:17.250
More than Reid, or Morgan ?

02:17.265 --> 02:19.183
Neither of them
confronted a suspect

02:19.205 --> 02:21.501
- and then shot and killed him.
- Yeah because they didn't find themselves

02:21.517 --> 02:23.602
in the position that
they needed to do so.

02:24.926 --> 02:27.402
I've been doing this long enough,
I know hypervigilance

02:27.407 --> 02:28.763
when I see it.

02:28.768 --> 02:31.131
Your first evaluation
is in a hour.

02:34.845 --> 02:36.740
Not everyone's an unsub.

02:38.598 --> 02:40.212
Don't be late.

02:43.415 --> 02:45.293
You're the boss.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.361
None of us are safe.

02:58.715 --> 03:01.171
The little boy,
he's only like 6.

03:01.186 --> 03:03.511
No one ever saw him again.

03:03.695 --> 03:05.241
What happened to him ?

03:05.247 --> 03:07.021
He's walking alone
in the woods,

03:07.036 --> 03:09.533
and then, step on something wet.

03:09.655 --> 03:11.231
And we he looked closer,

03:11.238 --> 03:13.122
he realized that was blood.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.643
Everywhere.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.932
Then he heard something
coming from behind him.

03:17.905 --> 03:19.931
Something,
coming after him.

03:19.947 --> 03:22.440
He kept looking behind,
to see what it was.

03:22.456 --> 03:24.770
But whatever it was,
he just kept chasing.

03:24.876 --> 03:27.470
And then, he ran into
this old man.

03:27.495 --> 03:28.892
When he tried to ask for help,

03:28.915 --> 03:31.182
the old man just smiled back.

03:31.766 --> 03:34.962
With the sharp fangs
stripping with blood.

03:35.858 --> 03:38.593
He tried to back away,
but before he could,

03:38.605 --> 03:41.371
he was tortured,
and eaten !

03:41.797 --> 03:43.600
By... by who ?

03:43.616 --> 03:45.543
That evil old man,

03:45.556 --> 03:47.631
he watches us all the time.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.750
Just watches us,
from the big old house on the hill.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.450
The one that's...

03:53.505 --> 03:54.630
haunted.

03:54.647 --> 03:56.293
Why does he watch us ?

03:56.306 --> 03:58.260
Cause he wants to eat
one of us.

03:58.265 --> 04:00.543
He's just deciding who's next.

04:01.496 --> 04:03.703
Next to be haunted like deer.

04:03.768 --> 04:04.903
Skinned.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.463
Eaten.

04:06.965 --> 04:07.952
Yep.

04:07.966 --> 04:10.130
It's just a matter of time.

04:19.947 --> 04:22.291
Nicholas Faye of Ozona, Texas,
was beaten to death

04:22.305 --> 04:24.031
roughly 13 hours ago.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.961
Blunt force trauma to the head,
he's the second young boy in Ozona

04:26.978 --> 04:29.233
to die the same death
in the last 2 months.

04:29.276 --> 04:31.633
Local hunter found his body
in the woods.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.930
First victim's name :
Robbie Davis.

04:33.958 --> 04:37.192
- Are these boys connected somehow ?
- Ozona's population's roughly 2,500.

04:37.205 --> 04:39.170
Everyone has some kind of connection.

04:39.666 --> 04:41.970
Well if they weren't linked before,
they most certainly are now.

04:41.986 --> 04:44.272
Both murdered
by the same offender.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.493
He's hunting children.

La team BAU pour www.forom.com et
http ://experts.heberg-forum.net

05:26.357 --> 05:27.300
Morning.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.551
- A moment sir ?
- What's up ?

05:29.597 --> 05:32.710
Agent Greenaway never showed
for her evaluation last night.

05:33.545 --> 05:36.142
- You're kidding ?
- The notice came through this morning.

05:36.228 --> 05:38.153
I called 3 times,
left messages,

05:38.178 --> 05:39.772
but she isn't calling back.

05:40.977 --> 05:42.190
Thank you.

05:43.157 --> 05:44.721
It doesn't look good.

05:44.836 --> 05:47.383
No, let's be honest, we know exactly
what it looks like.

05:48.527 --> 05:50.421
Elle let emotion
get in her way.

05:50.455 --> 05:52.660
And it goes against
everything we stand for.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.761
So don't you make
the same mistake ?

05:55.177 --> 05:57.330
She's innocent'til proven guilty.

05:57.346 --> 05:58.722
I know.

06:02.576 --> 06:04.840
I go to Texas,
you find Elle.

06:21.688 --> 06:22.823
<i>Plato wrote :</i>

06:22.827 --> 06:25.803
<i>"We can easily forgive a child
who's afraid of the dark.</i>

06:25.817 --> 06:27.652
<i>The real tragedy of life,</i>

06:27.658 --> 06:30.181
<i>is when men
are afraid of the light."</i>

06:41.277 --> 06:43.233
You guys see Elle's cleared ?

06:43.698 --> 06:46.622
- Self defense.
- So it was good shoot.

06:46.898 --> 06:48.922
She hit what she was aiming for.

06:49.445 --> 06:50.922
That's not what I meant.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.513
I know.

06:52.668 --> 06:54.880
If they cleared her how come
she's not here with us ?

06:54.976 --> 06:55.950
Or Hotch ?

06:55.956 --> 06:57.832
Focus on the case !

06:59.198 --> 07:01.101
Ozona Police
and autopsy report

07:01.107 --> 07:03.603
for Nicholas Faye
and Robbie Davis.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.533
Well the bludgeoning could suggest
frustration or rage.

07:06.547 --> 07:08.963
With no apparent
sexual motivation.

07:08.977 --> 07:10.772
That's rare when the victims
are this young.

07:10.785 --> 07:13.600
This Unsub seems to be
taking pleasure from the kill itself.

07:13.618 --> 07:16.612
So if it's not sexual, what's the
significance of targeting young males ?

07:16.627 --> 07:18.840
Most serial killers
pray upon specific types

07:18.856 --> 07:20.863
to carry out
their fantasies of revenge.

07:20.876 --> 07:23.402
Bundy killed women that looked like
an ex-girlfriend who jolted him,

07:23.415 --> 07:26.492
Dahmer claimed that schoolyard
harassment fed into his fury.

07:27.108 --> 07:30.122
Ok, so then maybe these kids reprensent
someone who victimized the offender.

07:30.136 --> 07:33.390
Like a young male from his past,
maybe a bully...

07:33.405 --> 07:35.333
older brother,
someone who abused him.

07:35.436 --> 07:37.020
No, that's unlikely.

07:37.146 --> 07:39.030
They just found another body.

07:39.036 --> 07:40.563
11 year old girl.

07:40.575 --> 07:43.572
What would the victimology
just suddenly change ?

07:43.578 --> 07:45.810
Maybe the girl wasn't the target,
maybe she just got in the way.

07:45.823 --> 07:48.585
Or the sex of his victim
is insignificant.

07:48.590 --> 07:51.631
Pace his killings certainly indicates
a velocity of change.

07:51.631 --> 07:53.477
We can't surveil every kid in Ozona,

07:53.479 --> 07:55.100
how we just keep them
all safe ?

07:55.115 --> 07:56.882
Enforce a curfew ?

07:56.896 --> 07:59.011
Children shouldn't have to worry about
something like that.

07:59.035 --> 08:00.412
Tell me about it.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.803
The woods were the only thing
I was afraid of when I was a kid.

08:02.818 --> 08:04.050
Seriously ?

08:04.067 --> 08:07.832
- I thought you grew up in a small town ?
- Yeah, surrounded by woods !

08:08.096 --> 08:10.152
- Yeah, bummer for you !
- Yeah.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.091
The only thing I was afraid of
was the dark.

08:12.106 --> 08:14.131
Some of us still are...

08:14.966 --> 08:16.573
When we land,
Morgan and Reid,

08:16.576 --> 08:18.381
go to the new crime scene.

08:18.397 --> 08:19.861
The little girl.

08:20.235 --> 08:23.222
I'll look at the scene
where Nicholas Faye was found.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.191
This is where
he dumped the body.

08:35.196 --> 08:36.892
This isn't a dump site.

08:37.294 --> 08:38.883
Murder happened right here.

08:40.296 --> 08:43.282
Autopsy report indicates
no signs of a struggle.

08:43.777 --> 08:45.860
Poor little guy never had a chance.

08:46.127 --> 08:48.933
So far into these woods,
no one could hear him scream.

08:49.437 --> 08:51.540
Exactly how is killer wanted it.

08:51.555 --> 08:54.151
For the last two months,
we've lost more children in this town

08:54.168 --> 08:56.500
we have in my whole lifetime.

08:56.735 --> 08:58.491
The others are car accidents.

08:59.096 --> 09:01.011
Residents are terrified.

09:01.155 --> 09:03.161
I have an 8 year old myself.

09:03.396 --> 09:05.421
Victims knew their killer.

09:05.515 --> 09:07.391
Followed him to this spot.

09:07.405 --> 09:09.130
What makes you think that ?

09:10.016 --> 09:13.030
Well I guess they went this deep into
the woods because they trusted him.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.933
Probably stashed his weapon
here beforehand.

09:16.287 --> 09:19.472
This means we're looking for someone
intelligent, methodical.

09:20.666 --> 09:22.073
Methodical ?

09:23.456 --> 09:26.542
Bashed the kid's head in,
looks like a moment of rage to me !

09:26.777 --> 09:28.232
I agree.

09:29.616 --> 09:31.180
It's confusing.

09:31.955 --> 09:33.902
Doesn't make sense.

09:34.846 --> 09:37.733
This is just a quarter mile from
where the two boys were killed.

09:37.755 --> 09:39.651
Bludgeoned to death the same way.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.351
Not entirely true.

09:42.545 --> 09:44.792
I found some markings
on her scalp

09:44.798 --> 09:47.080
that indicated that that psycho

09:47.556 --> 09:49.962
- beat her post mortem.
- Suggests the unsub

09:49.977 --> 09:52.663
- is getting more brazen.
- He's getting brazen all right,

09:52.676 --> 09:55.562
I've bagged three children
in the last month.

09:55.577 --> 09:58.343
And now he's spending more time
wih the victims even after death.

09:59.106 --> 10:01.183
He had to know he wasn't gonna
be interrupted but how ?

10:02.388 --> 10:04.060
How could he be so sure ?

10:04.175 --> 10:06.061
Forest goes for miles and miles,

10:06.075 --> 10:08.233
nobody goes walking in it.

10:08.246 --> 10:10.130
So looking to kill.

10:12.756 --> 10:14.021
Or hunt.

10:16.487 --> 10:18.853
In which case he knows
every inch of these woods, right ?

10:19.036 --> 10:20.373
Every trail ?

10:21.868 --> 10:24.811
Reid, whoever killed these children
is very familiar with this area.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.491
In my opinion he probably lived
in Ozona his whole life.

10:28.766 --> 10:30.842
It could be someone you know.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.840
Or it could be a stranger you pass
at the grocery store.

10:34.215 --> 10:36.453
But it's vital that we keep
our eyes open.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.903
And our chidren close.
Now as Ozona's guidance counselor,

10:39.915 --> 10:42.240
I can only help your children
with the aftermath,

10:42.346 --> 10:45.001
but our police department
is working

10:45.158 --> 10:46.593
with the FBI,

10:46.767 --> 10:48.800
gathering information
on the case,

10:48.818 --> 10:51.272
to elaborate on that,
agent Jason Gideon.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.341
We want you to know
we're doing everything we can

10:54.348 --> 10:56.223
to find the person responsible.

10:56.338 --> 10:59.312
Until we do there are number
of precautions that you'll need to take.

10:59.675 --> 11:01.893
Just let me go over
some of them with you.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.500
First and foremost,

11:03.537 --> 11:06.033
It's something we call the buddy system.

11:06.117 --> 11:08.681
That means you always go
everywhere with a friend.

11:08.725 --> 11:11.061
That's right because bad men and women
are more likely

11:11.065 --> 11:13.372
to talk to us only
when we're by ourselves.

11:13.387 --> 11:15.420
We don't know what these guys
look like yet.

11:15.438 --> 11:17.041
Might be someone you know.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.572
Yes sweetheart,
you got a question ?

11:19.887 --> 11:22.351
There was this little girl
once on the news,

11:22.365 --> 11:23.932
who just got grabbed.

11:23.956 --> 11:25.611
Right in front of her house.

11:25.928 --> 11:27.583
Could that happen to us ?

11:28.258 --> 11:30.201
Nothing's gonna happen
to any of you,

11:30.275 --> 11:32.692
as long as you remember
this buddy system, okay ?

11:32.697 --> 11:34.310
Anymore questions ?

11:34.325 --> 11:36.083
Did you ever find his hat ?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.990
- Excuse me ?
- She's Nicholas Faye's mother.

11:39.006 --> 11:41.031
The red one that I put on him,

11:42.476 --> 11:44.321
he had it on when he left.

11:44.615 --> 11:46.743
I'm sorry Mrs Faye,
we haven't.

11:49.398 --> 11:52.050
Mandatory curfew at 5PM.

11:54.268 --> 11:56.200
make sure you know
where your children are.

12:00.276 --> 12:01.490
You just gotta move fast,

12:01.505 --> 12:03.693
old man Fennigan can't eat you
if he can't catch you.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.992
- I want to go home.
- Come on,

12:06.006 --> 12:07.593
just ring the guy's bell.

12:07.597 --> 12:09.932
- Why don't you do it ?
- I already did,

12:09.938 --> 12:12.032
when I was like 5.

12:15.365 --> 12:17.061
It's just the wind.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.821
Now come on,
it'll be fun !

12:18.838 --> 12:21.220
- Not if he catches me !
- Come on, it'll be easy !

12:21.237 --> 12:23.422
Just ring and run.
We'll be right here.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.602
Yeah, now go.

12:25.858 --> 12:26.610
Go !

12:42.748 --> 12:45.043
- Go.
- Go !

13:02.687 --> 13:04.393
Let's go.

13:12.327 --> 13:13.631
Henry ?

13:13.938 --> 13:15.102
Simon ?

13:29.746 --> 13:30.632
Hotchner.

13:30.646 --> 13:31.872
Hey Hotch, what's happening ?

13:31.878 --> 13:34.122
<i>I went to her appartment to talk
to her but she was leaving</i>

13:34.136 --> 13:36.692
- with an overnight bag.
- So she's running ?

13:36.708 --> 13:38.462
I don't know,
I hope not.

13:38.477 --> 13:41.083
- I'm following her.
- All right, keep me posted.

13:42.306 --> 13:44.071
Just wait for me up front.

13:44.088 --> 13:46.201
- No wandering.
- Okay dad !

13:46.217 --> 13:47.913
It's too scary to let him
out of your sight !

13:47.918 --> 13:49.302
I know.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.760
Can I have your attention,
please ?

13:53.027 --> 13:54.432
Good afternoon.

13:54.545 --> 13:56.253
We want to make something clear.

13:56.265 --> 13:58.341
Due to the velocity of change,

13:58.697 --> 14:01.551
we predict this offender could try
to strike again anytime.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.563
His confidence builds
with every attack.

14:03.585 --> 14:05.393
Look for someone
physically fit,

14:05.486 --> 14:06.421
shy.

14:06.837 --> 14:09.512
Kind disposition, someone you may trust
with your own child.

14:09.818 --> 14:12.730
Because the killer targets kids,
he may be small himself.

14:12.748 --> 14:15.822
I know we keep referring to this Unsub
as "he", do not rule out a woman.

14:15.838 --> 14:17.802
- Excuse me !
- Chief !

14:17.927 --> 14:19.433
You're gonna want to hear this.

14:19.447 --> 14:21.253
My son Matthew never
came home today.

14:21.265 --> 14:23.523
- Here we go.
- Where was he last seen ?

14:23.527 --> 14:25.803
His teacher saw him
in the parking lot after school.

14:25.817 --> 14:26.913
Search team.

14:29.955 --> 14:32.451
Okay Reid.
School is on Willow road.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.951
The boy was abducted.

14:33.977 --> 14:36.530
This area would be
the most secluded nearby.

14:36.547 --> 14:38.560
So Jones could route his guys
to the gas station,

14:38.577 --> 14:40.880
- we could cover territories...
- Maam ! Why don't you sit down.

14:40.896 --> 14:43.151
- Let's get some backup on Willow road.
- Thank you.

14:44.945 --> 14:46.353
So how old is Matthew ?

14:46.377 --> 14:48.241
He turned 8 in august.

14:48.257 --> 14:49.631
I have a niece that's 8.

14:49.697 --> 14:52.043
Very resourceful at that age.

14:52.185 --> 14:54.200
What are you thinking about
over here ?

14:54.218 --> 14:55.290
Nothing.

14:55.315 --> 14:57.911
Well you look an awful upset
to be thinking about nothing.

14:59.835 --> 15:01.511
You look like you have a secret.

15:03.308 --> 15:04.822
Secrets are important.

15:06.555 --> 15:07.951
Is it about your brother ?

15:08.637 --> 15:09.710
Honey ?

15:09.975 --> 15:12.563
Is that true,
are you hiding something ?

15:14.678 --> 15:16.511
You want to protect him right ?

15:16.946 --> 15:18.711
That's what brothers are for.

15:21.365 --> 15:24.300
Manny said he was just clawing
the doorbell.

15:24.738 --> 15:26.621
At the haunted house.

15:27.265 --> 15:29.460
- On the hill.
- It's Fennigan's place.

15:29.478 --> 15:32.530
- Who's Fennigan ?
- This old guy who is in the house.

15:32.547 --> 15:35.133
Forever kind of a local legend.

15:35.156 --> 15:36.942
- Ghost story.
- About ?

15:37.066 --> 15:40.040
He supposably watches the kids
from his window,

15:41.746 --> 15:44.233
Hunts them, skins them,

15:44.325 --> 15:45.582
eats them.

15:46.116 --> 15:48.161
- Standard.
- Folks have been telling that story

15:48.166 --> 15:50.790
- since I was a kid.
- Why haven't we heard about that ?

15:50.808 --> 15:53.590
Fables are often sparked
by an ounce of truth.

15:53.768 --> 15:55.821
We should exhaust every possibility.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.433
I'm sorry dad.

16:10.626 --> 16:12.323
You've been following me.

16:13.676 --> 16:15.082
What's going on ?

16:19.528 --> 16:20.892
Elle, I'm listening.

16:24.736 --> 16:25.902
Okay.

16:27.776 --> 16:29.971
I really wanted to be
a part of the team.

16:29.987 --> 16:32.441
- You were.
- But when I needed the team,

16:32.878 --> 16:34.551
I was all alone.

16:34.595 --> 16:37.010
I was alone in the one place
that I have the right

16:37.018 --> 16:39.270
to feel safe
and that's my home.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.910
Just like those women in Ohio
who were attacked

16:41.926 --> 16:43.910
had the right to feel safe
in their homes.

16:43.916 --> 16:46.790
So does that justify taking the law
into your own hands ?

16:49.625 --> 16:51.880
What makes you say
that I have ?

16:51.898 --> 16:54.362
Because you're here
confessing your sins.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.792
I know I don't have any evidence,
and you know how quickly

16:57.806 --> 16:59.740
I'd arrest you if I did.

17:02.007 --> 17:03.703
So what are we gonna do
about it ?

17:21.247 --> 17:22.873
Sure looks like
a haunted house.

17:22.885 --> 17:25.040
Morgan, you and Jones
take the front,

17:25.055 --> 17:27.823
Reid and I'll cover
the outbuildings.

17:48.345 --> 17:49.251
Come on.

17:58.437 --> 17:59.891
Mr Fennigan !

18:23.056 --> 18:23.761
Go.

18:30.085 --> 18:31.041
Clear.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.270
Go, go.

19:02.487 --> 19:04.283
Upstairs is clear.

19:05.515 --> 19:06.973
Fennigan's not here.

19:06.987 --> 19:08.703
And either is the missing boy.

19:09.835 --> 19:11.571
Electricity's out.

19:11.645 --> 19:12.783
I know.

19:13.957 --> 19:15.532
Maybe he's been away.

19:15.837 --> 19:16.511
No,

19:17.175 --> 19:19.191
this paper was delivered today.

19:20.347 --> 19:22.663
So Fennigan was here earlier.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.922
Yeah question is,
where is he know ?

19:27.386 --> 19:28.900
Stairwell.

19:33.508 --> 19:35.282
FBI, don't move !

19:36.347 --> 19:37.470
Okay.

19:39.628 --> 19:41.720
- Are you Matthew ?
- Yes.

19:42.076 --> 19:43.781
- Are you hurt ?
- No.

19:43.796 --> 19:45.080
Ok, come on.

19:46.428 --> 19:48.812
I didn't want the old man
to find me.

19:48.825 --> 19:51.361
That's all right,
no one's gonna hurt you.

19:51.688 --> 19:52.702
Come on.

19:53.016 --> 19:54.441
Let's go.

19:56.556 --> 19:58.962
- Did you get anything ?
<i>- Only that Fennigan's house on the hill</i>

19:58.977 --> 20:01.400
is like the Bates Motel
of Ozona, Texas.

20:01.406 --> 20:02.731
You know we heard the legend.

20:02.748 --> 20:06.371
Reid, seriously, people that go into
that house supposedly never come out.

20:06.467 --> 20:07.923
Spookie !

20:07.937 --> 20:10.782
Garcia, could at least pretend
not to enjoy that rumour so much,

20:10.797 --> 20:12.552
since I've actually entered the house ?

20:12.556 --> 20:14.093
Sensitive. Sorry.

20:14.095 --> 20:17.392
Besides, local police say that there are
no reports of that actually happening.

20:17.407 --> 20:18.921
Yeah this is true,

20:18.938 --> 20:21.030
all complaints filed were false alarms.

20:21.045 --> 20:24.012
But then there is that matter
of his missing wife.

20:24.027 --> 20:26.461
Wife, what wife ?
When did she go missing ?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.391
Almost 50 years ago.

20:28.805 --> 20:30.303
No record of her ever being found ?

20:30.305 --> 20:32.901
I got two words for you,
my friend : "rear window".

20:32.917 --> 20:35.333
That guy probably chopped that lady up
into delicious bites

20:35.346 --> 20:37.113
and little pieces.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.952
Think about it.
She may have never left the premises.

20:40.288 --> 20:42.711
She may still be
in the house...

20:43.285 --> 20:44.501
Garcia,

20:44.678 --> 20:46.722
I'm sitting here in the dark
alone, thanks.

20:46.736 --> 20:49.621
While you're waiting for
a potential murderer to come home ?

20:49.636 --> 20:50.961
<i>It's kind of dangerous !</i>

20:50.966 --> 20:52.413
It's kinda sexy !

20:52.468 --> 20:53.491
I gotta go.

20:53.507 --> 20:56.072
You're having creepy fun,
I wish I as there !

21:02.538 --> 21:04.752
- You really are afraid of the dark.
- I'm working on that.

21:04.758 --> 21:06.272
You should work a little harder !

21:06.286 --> 21:08.651
My deputy got the boy home safe.

21:09.107 --> 21:12.002
Turns out the poor kid got spooked
by a tree branch.

21:12.046 --> 21:13.541
This whole town's on edge.

21:13.547 --> 21:15.730
Maybe that's why
Fennigan's in the wind.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.362
Chat's interesting.

21:20.378 --> 21:22.433
The Unsub didn't use a gun.

21:23.008 --> 21:25.221
And he knows every trail
in Ozona.

21:26.198 --> 21:28.260
Fennigan's an avid hunter.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.243
Why didn't he use...

21:35.726 --> 21:37.940
Robbie Davis
First victim.

21:38.216 --> 21:39.453
Sarah P.

21:40.056 --> 21:41.280
Sarah Peterson right ?

21:41.286 --> 21:44.212
I guess Fennigan brought the kids back here
first before baiting them into the woods.

21:44.478 --> 21:46.282
But why wouldn't he get rid of
the evidence ?

21:46.286 --> 21:48.052
Considers them trophies.

21:49.658 --> 21:52.492
When this is all said and done,
I'd like to hang his head on my wall.

22:14.938 --> 22:18.021
Sheriff called the search off,
we located the boy.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.070
He's home.

22:19.086 --> 22:21.500
- Safe and sound.
- What about old man Fennigan ?

22:38.376 --> 22:40.493
I think we just found him.

22:51.256 --> 22:53.671
At first blush,
it looks like Joseph Fennigan

22:53.688 --> 22:55.320
died of natural causes.

22:55.335 --> 22:57.651
His heart probably gave out
while he was setting this.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.603
Yeah karma's a bitch.

22:59.857 --> 23:02.501
Those coyotes were on and on
for all week.

23:02.508 --> 23:04.560
Before the second and third murders
ever happened.

23:04.575 --> 23:06.423
This area's off a traveled path,

23:06.427 --> 23:08.283
it's a wonder anyone
discovered him at all.

23:08.297 --> 23:09.671
Is it ?

23:09.736 --> 23:12.553
Those leaves didn't cover him up
by themselves.

23:12.748 --> 23:13.812
He's right.

23:13.896 --> 23:15.810
The deputy may not have been
the first that found him.

23:15.827 --> 23:18.292
Our only suspect's been cleared.

23:18.696 --> 23:20.042
Square one ?

23:20.075 --> 23:20.783
No.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.881
Fennigan's been dead all this time,
who's living in his house ?

23:25.215 --> 23:26.581
Let's go.

23:27.365 --> 23:28.713
Here's a question :

23:28.725 --> 23:30.312
if a tree falls in the forest,

23:30.325 --> 23:32.742
does it make a sound
if there's nobody there to hear it ?

23:33.368 --> 23:36.091
- What the hell are you reading over there ?
- Just thinking.

23:36.407 --> 23:38.062
The Unsub found Fennigan's corpse

23:38.077 --> 23:40.873
in a lightly traveled part of the woods
and no one else knew.

23:41.606 --> 23:44.071
So he was able to use his house
and no one was the wizer.

23:44.086 --> 23:46.343
Actually I was referring
to Fennigan's wife.

23:46.528 --> 23:48.680
- What are you talking about ?
- She was rumoured missing,

23:48.717 --> 23:50.992
perhaps killed almost 50 years ago.

23:50.996 --> 23:53.542
When in actuality she left Fennigan
for another man.

23:53.575 --> 23:55.523
He writes about it
in his journals.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.550
How he would look out the window
on a daily basis

23:57.567 --> 24:00.322
to see if she would come home,
she never did.

24:00.618 --> 24:02.222
He never recovered, he ended up

24:02.248 --> 24:05.180
turning into a recluse
that people in town misunderstood.

24:05.186 --> 24:06.350
Found something.

24:09.327 --> 24:10.493
Provisions.

24:11.465 --> 24:14.353
Delivered by the church
to every elder's doorstep.

24:14.565 --> 24:16.633
Each one dated
after Fennigan died.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.471
So the Unsub ate everything.

24:18.988 --> 24:20.650
Almost everything.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.713
Unopened bowls of cream spinach
thrown into the trash.

24:23.776 --> 24:26.551
- Each one wrapped with ductape.
- One with each tray.

24:26.576 --> 24:29.123
So we're looking for a guy
who really really hates spinach.

24:29.155 --> 24:32.631
- Who doesn't ?
- Ritualized, meticulous, organized.

24:33.067 --> 24:34.670
He would eat
with the same particulars.

24:34.898 --> 24:36.543
All prints,

24:36.565 --> 24:38.741
have Garcia run them
for a match.

24:39.787 --> 24:40.920
Hotch.

24:43.445 --> 24:45.140
It's about Elle, isn't it ?

24:47.136 --> 24:49.891
- I don't know.
- You know I talked to her in Ohio.

24:50.525 --> 24:53.233
- Reid, we all talked to her.
- No, I talked to her

24:53.458 --> 24:54.603
before...

24:54.917 --> 24:56.641
I went to her room one night, and...

24:56.687 --> 24:58.091
she was drinking.

24:58.385 --> 24:59.681
She almost died.

25:00.846 --> 25:02.462
I'd be drinking too.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.722
About the woods, JJ.

25:13.858 --> 25:14.842
Your fear.

25:15.356 --> 25:16.953
You said it was of the woods.

25:18.388 --> 25:21.153
I used to be a camp councelor,
when I was a teenager.

25:21.207 --> 25:23.001
In the woods up in Vermont,

25:23.185 --> 25:25.613
at the night shift,
tucked the girls in,

25:25.627 --> 25:27.461
turned off the lights.
The typical drill.

25:27.478 --> 25:30.082
Everything seemed fine,
all the kids were asleep.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.911
You know, nothing
seemed out of the ordinary.

25:33.358 --> 25:34.523
Until...

25:35.226 --> 25:38.180
I noticed there was some blood,
on the hallway floor.

25:38.196 --> 25:40.560
So I... followed the blood trail out

25:40.576 --> 25:43.220
to the camp director's cabin,

25:43.316 --> 25:45.490
walked up to his bed and...

25:45.747 --> 25:48.421
he was just lying there,
underneath his covers.

25:49.336 --> 25:51.720
Dead.
Someone stabbed him.

25:51.897 --> 25:53.942
I ran out of there so fast,

25:54.417 --> 25:57.340
out the door, down the hall,
I just remember it,

25:57.476 --> 25:58.802
being really dark.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.732
Once I got to the door,
there was another councelor there,

26:01.748 --> 26:03.582
I guess she heared me scream.

26:04.527 --> 26:06.511
They caught the caretaker
on his way to town,

26:06.528 --> 26:08.602
I guess he still had
the knife on him.

26:09.746 --> 26:11.960
Anyway, I guess that's probably
when I decided

26:11.977 --> 26:14.053
I didn't like the woods.

26:16.188 --> 26:17.452
You're serious ?

26:20.158 --> 26:21.081
No !

26:22.566 --> 26:23.422
No !

26:25.856 --> 26:27.872
Come on. I don't know
why I'm afraid of the woods,

26:27.886 --> 26:30.371
I just I am, why is he still
afraid of the dark ?

26:30.386 --> 26:32.363
Yeah Reid, why are you still
afraid of the dark ?

26:32.375 --> 26:34.513
Because of the inherent
absence of light !

26:34.797 --> 26:36.270
JJ, that was pretty good,

26:36.297 --> 26:39.060
- just know that paybacks are a bitch.
- I'm shaking.

26:39.286 --> 26:40.133
Yeah.

26:40.148 --> 26:41.841
I love our relationship,

26:41.867 --> 26:43.381
we hardly need words.

26:43.387 --> 26:45.123
Hey girl, you got
something good for me ?

26:45.148 --> 26:47.453
<i>I pulled two sets of prints off
those food trays.</i>

26:48.137 --> 26:50.071
- Two ?
- One belonging to a child.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.941
But which one of the victims, why don't you
coordinate with the Ozona coroner's office

26:52.957 --> 26:55.592
- for a match ?
- Oh baby, that's so yesterday !

26:55.628 --> 26:57.942
I already have the minions
working on it. In the meantime,

26:57.947 --> 27:01.012
your intrepid hacker found you a match
to the other set in the database.

27:01.027 --> 27:02.883
His name is James Charles,

27:02.896 --> 27:04.701
<i>he's a local guidance councelor.</i>

27:04.718 --> 27:07.173
Yeah he's local guidance councelor
helping us on this case !

27:07.186 --> 27:10.450
Kidding ?
He's address is 3725 Bryarwood road.

27:10.655 --> 27:12.871
I know exactly how to find him,
Garcia, thanks.

27:12.968 --> 27:15.193
Call Gideon,
we just found our Unsub.

27:23.945 --> 27:25.982
Sure about this ?

27:26.597 --> 27:27.430
Charles ?

27:27.447 --> 27:30.483
Born and raise in Ozona, knows
the territory, works with children.

27:30.498 --> 27:33.922
Highly organized, slight in stature,
injected himself into the investigation.

27:34.515 --> 27:37.720
What do you think happened the last six
months that would have changed his life ?

27:40.227 --> 27:42.583
His wife walked out on him
and his kid.

27:42.585 --> 27:44.293
There's your stressor.

27:44.766 --> 27:46.640
Guys, he's on the move.

27:50.425 --> 27:51.930
Mr Charles !

27:53.576 --> 27:54.652
Don't do it !

28:04.757 --> 28:06.193
Why are you running ?

28:06.787 --> 28:07.980
Give me this.

28:14.515 --> 28:15.791
What's this ?

28:15.795 --> 28:18.303
What's this ?
What's so important about the hat ?

28:19.158 --> 28:21.791
Nicholas Faye was wearing it
when he was murdered.

28:36.418 --> 28:37.742
Here's a deal.

28:38.015 --> 28:40.420
I could stand here and tell you what
I think you were doing in Fennigan's house

28:40.428 --> 28:41.942
for the last two weeks.

28:42.985 --> 28:44.933
Or you could do us all a favor.

28:45.007 --> 28:47.581
Sign a confession, maybe get
a little something taken off your time,

28:47.596 --> 28:48.792
what do you say ?

28:49.705 --> 28:52.112
I never stepped
inside Fennigan's house.

28:56.148 --> 28:59.062
<i>That's not really the answer
I was looking for James.</i>

29:00.615 --> 29:03.543
See. Fact is, we got
your fingerprints,

29:03.565 --> 29:06.263
inside the house,
all over the trays of food.

29:06.305 --> 29:07.731
Of course you did.

29:07.745 --> 29:09.732
I deliver them every week.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.421
It's true.

29:14.425 --> 29:17.173
He started working working
at the food bank after his wife left.

29:17.196 --> 29:19.270
Fingerprints aren't all we have.

29:27.606 --> 29:29.801
What are you doing
with Nicholas Faye's hat ?

29:30.875 --> 29:32.233
Maybe,

29:32.695 --> 29:34.541
you were trying
to dispose of it.

29:34.726 --> 29:37.063
<i>Or were you so proud of your keeps
that you just want to find</i>

29:37.076 --> 29:39.160
<i>a nice safe place to hide it ?</i>

29:41.177 --> 29:43.533
How these last 6 months've been
for you James ?

29:46.477 --> 29:47.820
Not too good huh ?

29:48.345 --> 29:50.962
I don't know, your whole life
is falling apart isn't it ?

29:51.258 --> 29:53.552
Oh yeah you got to be feeling
a loss of control,

29:53.795 --> 29:55.390
sense of abandonment.

29:56.048 --> 29:57.640
And I would guess,

29:57.976 --> 29:59.531
a little impotent maybe ?

30:00.998 --> 30:03.161
<i>Come on man,
give me something !</i>

30:03.475 --> 30:05.383
Why did your life leave you ?

30:06.525 --> 30:08.223
What happened James,
she get bored ?

30:08.837 --> 30:11.603
I mean you don't seem
all that exciting to me.

30:12.017 --> 30:13.960
She started feeling
a little uninspired ?

30:16.275 --> 30:17.982
You're not a minute man,
aren't you ?

30:18.646 --> 30:20.722
Uh, that's what it is !

30:20.826 --> 30:23.282
You're done before
she even get started, she left you

30:23.305 --> 30:26.133
for another man...
Okay !

30:26.426 --> 30:28.523
James, that was exciting !

30:29.588 --> 30:30.920
Did I hit a nerve ?

30:31.218 --> 30:33.840
- I want to go home.
- Oh you wanna go home ?

30:34.418 --> 30:36.570
Well I'm sorry, that ain't about
to happen. So why don't you

30:36.595 --> 30:38.740
come over here
and sit your ass down ?

30:39.698 --> 30:41.260
I said sit down !

30:41.538 --> 30:43.660
I'm done talking to you.

30:43.715 --> 30:46.501
I will tell you what you are done
doing, you hear me ?

30:51.007 --> 30:52.363
Yeah, what did you found out ?

30:52.377 --> 30:54.522
The second set of prints didn't match
any of the victims.

30:54.546 --> 30:56.802
<i>So there might be a fourth victim
still out there.</i>

30:56.825 --> 30:59.013
Check surrounding towns
for missing children reports

30:59.027 --> 31:00.622
and get right back to me.

31:01.167 --> 31:03.533
You know, it's bad enough
his mother left

31:03.547 --> 31:05.391
and now his father's
in custody and--

31:05.448 --> 31:07.950
we've got to take the poor kid
into child services.

31:07.986 --> 31:11.413
- It's the law...
- So is jaywalking. I don't like it.

31:14.145 --> 31:17.012
Good afternoon this is agent Jareau,
with the FBI,

31:17.245 --> 31:20.161
we're gonna be picking up
Jeffrey Charles in about 20 minutes, if...

31:22.628 --> 31:23.873
Okay, I see.

31:23.967 --> 31:24.841
Thank you.

31:26.057 --> 31:26.920
What is it ?

31:30.898 --> 31:32.513
<i>James, I can't help you.</i>

31:32.808 --> 31:34.312
<i>if you don't talk,
I can't help you.</i>

31:34.336 --> 31:35.950
Jeffrey never was at school today.

31:35.958 --> 31:37.563
His father said he was sick.

31:37.915 --> 31:39.053
<i>Something !</i>

31:44.837 --> 31:45.691
Yeah.

31:45.956 --> 31:47.770
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.723
What were you doing ?

31:57.697 --> 32:00.591
Working your way up to the victim
you wanted to kill the most ?

32:01.197 --> 32:02.241
Your son ?

32:03.577 --> 32:05.071
What did you do with him James ?

32:07.096 --> 32:09.810
Are you really that weak,
you've got to blame your own kid

32:09.836 --> 32:11.780
- for your failed marriage ?
- Shut up !

32:11.798 --> 32:14.521
No you talk to me !
Cause I need to understant this.

32:14.805 --> 32:17.383
You beat those children
who trusted you, why ?

32:17.768 --> 32:19.672
So you could regain your power ?

32:20.145 --> 32:21.762
I've got a news flash for you :

32:21.786 --> 32:23.360
You never had any to begin with.

32:23.365 --> 32:24.951
That's right keep it coming,
keep it coming.

32:24.966 --> 32:27.892
I am so far from finish with you,
you son of a bitch.

32:28.268 --> 32:30.622
I will go all night, you understand me ?

32:31.796 --> 32:33.160
You make me sick !

32:44.996 --> 32:45.962
What is that ?

32:46.315 --> 32:47.683
It's an EpiPen.

32:48.835 --> 32:49.980
Weird.

33:03.885 --> 33:05.732
Think I just found something.

33:09.166 --> 33:09.982
Yeah.

33:10.007 --> 33:12.293
An EpiPen, and a refrigirator
that's filled

33:12.306 --> 33:15.002
with dairy products
that have been sealed with ductape.

33:15.006 --> 33:16.222
Thank you,

33:16.538 --> 33:18.101
that's helpful.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.541
You know what happens to guys,

33:21.645 --> 33:23.382
who mess with kids,
on the inside ?

33:23.386 --> 33:25.842
- Do you ?
- Can I have a word with him ?

33:28.115 --> 33:28.861
Yeah.

33:34.775 --> 33:36.431
It's a rough day, huh ?

33:37.875 --> 33:38.740
Coffee ?

33:39.538 --> 33:41.012
Yeah I wouldn't mind.

33:42.897 --> 33:43.871
Milk ?

33:45.035 --> 33:46.811
- Please.
- So when ?

33:48.245 --> 33:49.081
When ?

34:03.515 --> 34:04.920
How long have you known ?

34:05.325 --> 34:06.452
Known what ?

34:07.378 --> 34:09.050
That your son is a murderer ?

34:09.768 --> 34:11.411
What are you talking about ?

34:11.496 --> 34:12.753
You might have been--

34:13.036 --> 34:15.851
the one who brought the food trays
to Fennigan's, but...

34:16.137 --> 34:17.630
Your son ate them,

34:19.588 --> 34:21.533
everything but the cream spinach.

34:21.687 --> 34:23.001
You want me to confess ?

34:23.007 --> 34:25.150
Is that what this game is ?

34:25.605 --> 34:27.543
That's fine.
You bring me another pen,

34:27.565 --> 34:29.152
I'll write out my confession.

34:29.297 --> 34:31.232
We found an EpiPen
in your kitchen.

34:31.268 --> 34:34.370
So what that proves
that my kid has an allergy.

34:34.737 --> 34:35.670
To milk.

34:36.846 --> 34:38.951
- How did you know that ?
- You just told me.

34:42.838 --> 34:44.370
What's the matter ?

34:50.385 --> 34:52.623
Jeffrey's allergy's dangerous.

34:54.197 --> 34:57.011
So much, so he wrapped
the only dairy product with ductape

34:57.025 --> 34:58.871
so he wouldn't accidentally eat it.

35:00.875 --> 35:02.831
You taught him all to protect himself.

35:09.047 --> 35:10.942
I found the baseball cap.

35:12.817 --> 35:14.580
I found it this morning.

35:21.158 --> 35:23.620
It was in my son's drawer.

35:26.398 --> 35:28.503
Where is he Mr. Charles ?

35:36.148 --> 35:37.671
- Jason !
- Cut it out !

35:37.686 --> 35:39.131
Cut it out...

35:39.746 --> 35:42.253
- Let's go Simon.
- Let's go Simon.

35:43.398 --> 35:45.023
Where are you going ?

35:45.408 --> 35:47.511
We're supposed to walk each other home !

35:47.688 --> 35:49.403
I'm walking to Henry's.

35:49.427 --> 35:51.501
But he doesn't live
in our street !

35:54.248 --> 35:55.880
I'll walk you home.

35:56.535 --> 35:59.290
- Hey Jeffrey
- Because you shoudn't be walking alone.

35:59.677 --> 36:02.191
You know, the whole "buddy system".

36:02.265 --> 36:04.712
Yeah, that's really
nice of you, thanks.

36:04.728 --> 36:07.312
Come on, I know a shortcut.

36:17.325 --> 36:18.993
Where is he Mr Charles ?

36:19.087 --> 36:21.661
- I left him at home.
- Well he's not there.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.981
If he's not there,
I don't know where he is.

36:24.685 --> 36:27.633
An 8 year old girl, Tracey Belle,
has been reported missing.

36:27.647 --> 36:29.833
Last seen getting off her schoolbus
on Fuller Road.

36:29.848 --> 36:32.260
Get it to your field units,
we'll need backup.

36:35.126 --> 36:36.103
Let's go.

36:36.548 --> 36:39.163
- Give Mac and the second unit Fuller Road.
- Yes, sir.

36:50.285 --> 36:52.532
How much longer ?

36:53.418 --> 36:55.540
You're walking to slow.

36:56.037 --> 36:58.170
This book bag is heavy.

36:58.826 --> 37:00.683
My legs are tired.

37:04.406 --> 37:06.080
- Why did you do that ?
- Shut up !

37:06.095 --> 37:07.271
Keep walking.

37:07.288 --> 37:08.690
I don't feel good.

37:09.118 --> 37:11.322
I told you to shut up !

37:25.028 --> 37:26.222
You know,

37:26.765 --> 37:29.021
after his mom left Jeffrey
probably resented the fact

37:29.028 --> 37:32.040
that his dad spends more time at work
with other kids than with his own.

37:32.715 --> 37:34.673
He took out that rage
on any kid he viewed,

37:34.688 --> 37:36.153
as having what he didn't.

37:36.166 --> 37:39.180
So Tracey's mom said the bus would have
dropped her off here after school

37:39.195 --> 37:41.153
she was supposed to walk home with a neighbor.

37:41.156 --> 37:43.920
It's most likely when Jeffrey approched,
but where he'd taken her ?

37:43.928 --> 37:45.610
Such heavy patrolling
in this town.

37:45.627 --> 37:47.910
How did he managed to take
a little without being seen ?

37:47.926 --> 37:49.300
Because we taught him.

37:49.316 --> 37:51.462
Nobody's gonna think anything
of two kids walking together.

37:51.475 --> 37:53.122
The buddy system, remember ?

37:53.137 --> 37:56.153
In the process of educating the public,
we educated a killer.

37:56.167 --> 37:59.391
When it's off season from baseball,
where would a 12 year old kid hang out ?

37:59.395 --> 38:01.050
- A park.
- Surrounded by woods.

38:01.065 --> 38:02.151
Let's go.

38:08.466 --> 38:10.353
Tracey !

38:15.358 --> 38:17.251
Let's just go home.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.090
I was only playing !

38:21.097 --> 38:23.181
Why do you have
to be such a baby ?

38:29.838 --> 38:31.710
Tracey ?

38:37.588 --> 38:39.550
Tracey !

38:56.327 --> 38:57.510
Tracey Belle's.

38:57.518 --> 38:59.952
He's got her in these woods. Split up !

39:42.486 --> 39:43.652
Enough !

39:45.898 --> 39:47.843
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah.

40:12.726 --> 40:14.281
Why did you hurt those kids ?

40:16.756 --> 40:18.493
Because I wanted to.

41:09.658 --> 41:11.292
I should have said something.

41:14.727 --> 41:15.463
What ?

41:15.966 --> 41:17.933
To Gideon or Hotch, or...

41:18.196 --> 41:19.552
Any of you guys.

41:19.636 --> 41:21.433
I talked to Elle that night, and...

41:21.575 --> 41:22.851
I knew she wasn't

41:23.067 --> 41:24.121
right, but.

41:26.246 --> 41:27.653
I should have told someone.

41:30.547 --> 41:31.361
Reid.

41:31.627 --> 41:32.571
Listen to me.

41:32.735 --> 41:34.891
Do not do that to yourself.

41:35.228 --> 41:37.172
You were just trying
to help a friend.

41:37.225 --> 41:39.391
You hear me ?
Don't go there kid.

41:39.935 --> 41:41.552
Elle made her own choice.

41:42.055 --> 41:43.432
That's on her.

41:50.746 --> 41:52.651
She hasn't admitted anything ?

41:52.906 --> 41:53.601
No.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.171
Well, you're doing the right thing.

41:56.716 --> 41:58.262
Yeah I know that.

41:58.428 --> 42:00.100
So see you in a few hours.

42:00.258 --> 42:01.211
Okay.

42:06.207 --> 42:07.323
Gideon ?

42:08.808 --> 42:09.460
Yeah.

42:09.758 --> 42:11.402
Tell him I say goodbye.

42:22.396 --> 42:24.581
This is not an admission of guilt.

42:25.626 --> 42:26.480
Right.

42:29.507 --> 42:31.811
You know when I first started this job,

42:32.576 --> 42:35.643
this sound of my phone ringing,
a call from the Bureau,

42:36.335 --> 42:39.832
I used to get so excited the blood
would race through my veins.

42:40.148 --> 42:42.721
And now,
that same sound

42:43.125 --> 42:44.833
paralyzes me.

42:46.546 --> 42:48.671
I'm not the same person anymore.

42:51.198 --> 42:53.033
That night at Lee's,

42:54.016 --> 42:55.831
if I had to do it
all over again,

42:55.848 --> 42:57.570
I wouldn't change a thing.

42:57.926 --> 42:59.782
Even though you killed someone.

43:06.397 --> 43:08.001
I guess that's it then.

43:12.196 --> 43:13.423
You know,

43:13.597 --> 43:15.450
when I first joined the team,

43:16.685 --> 43:19.402
I couldn't figure out
why you never ever smile.

43:21.577 --> 43:23.751
Now I think I'm actually
gonna miss that.

43:41.608 --> 43:43.452
I'm gonna miss you too.

43:44.305 --> 43:50.818
