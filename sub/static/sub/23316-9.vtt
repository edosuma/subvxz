02:53.480 --> 02:55.080
Moreno? Bro?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.000
Are you okay?

03:20.920 --> 03:24.880
-Pass it to me.
-Here you go.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.280
-Are you listening? Can I talk?
-Shoot.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.900
I found replacements
for Avihai and Steve.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.800
Both special operations fighters.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.720
Great. Have you got
a replacement for me too?

03:41.760 --> 03:45.200
-Gideon shut down the unit.
-What?!

03:45.360 --> 03:47.560
We're all out. So are you.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.680
Got a cigarette?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.680
-Moreno, talk to him.
-It's pointless.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.840
Have you got a cigarette
or not?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.200
C'mon, Moreno,
it's not the time to do this,

04:05.360 --> 04:08.600
when God-knows who's got Doron
out there in The Territories.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.440
Since when do you
care about Doron?

04:10.600 --> 04:12.120
What do you mean?
He was my commander.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.520
But you could never stand him.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.480
When he rejoined the unit,
I saw in your eyes you wanted to die.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.440
Well, it doesn't matter now.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.640
I can't believe Gideon would
chuck his friends just like that.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.120
We're not friends.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.600
You saved his ass countless times,
haven't you? You're friends.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.440
One must never forget
his friends.

04:41.240 --> 04:47.240
PALESTINE PREVENTIVE SECURITY HQ
RAMALLAH

05:04.160 --> 05:06.160
Relax, Eran. Breathe.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.080
[ARABIC]
[-Hey, how are you?]

05:26.800 --> 05:28.960
[-Hello and welcome.]
[-How are you?]

05:29.120 --> 05:30.600
[How are you, my friend?]

05:32.360 --> 05:34.640
[-Have a seat.]
[-Thanks.]

05:37.040 --> 05:39.120
[What brings you here,
Captain Ayub?]

05:40.520 --> 05:43.320
[Najib, will it be much longer?]

05:43.920 --> 05:46.560
[We want you to catch Abu Ahmad
and hand him to us.]

05:46.720 --> 05:50.040
[That murderer is on the loose,
making fun of you and us.]

05:50.200 --> 05:52.120
[You want Abu Ahmad?]

05:52.280 --> 05:53.960
[I thought you killed him.]

05:56.280 --> 05:58.600
[Thank you, God bless you.
Have some coffee.]

05:58.760 --> 06:00.440
[-Thanks.]
[-Drink up.]

06:00.760 --> 06:02.960
[That jackass still
works for you?]

06:04.520 --> 06:06.080
[Here you go.]

06:07.080 --> 06:09.920
[I'm under a lot of pressure
from my superiors.]

06:10.520 --> 06:13.520
[I don't want that to happen,
but if you don't hand him to us,]

06:13.680 --> 06:17.400
[I won't be able to stop them.
They'll start by retracting their approval]

06:17.560 --> 06:20.640
[for your brother's resort,
just to break your spirit.]

06:20.800 --> 06:22.560
[Wouldn't that be a shame?]

06:22.720 --> 06:24.560
[You and I go back many years.]

06:24.800 --> 06:28.120
[So don't use my brother's resort
to threaten me.]

06:28.280 --> 06:31.560
[You think I don't know
that he works for you guys?]

06:32.640 --> 06:34.280
[Listen to me carefully.]

06:34.440 --> 06:37.380
[I sat in your prison
for 17 years,]

06:37.540 --> 06:41.040
[but I never feared you people,
and I don't intend to start now.]

06:41.200 --> 06:46.040
[Abu Mahr, you know that I have
the highest regard for you.]

06:46.240 --> 06:49.720
[If you want my help with the crappy
situation you and Taufiq Hammed created,]

06:49.880 --> 06:52.840
[no problem,
I'll try to help,]

06:53.000 --> 06:56.160
[but he must stop snooping around us,
trying to become a hero.]

06:56.320 --> 06:59.800
[Things are worse than you think.
We know for sure that Abu Ahmad]

06:59.960 --> 07:03.120
[is planning a massive attack,
9/11 style.]

07:03.280 --> 07:05.360
[He has named the operation
<i>Al Buraq</i>.]

07:05.520 --> 07:07.840
[The plan is to take down
several towers.]

07:08.080 --> 07:10.960
[If he succeeds, it will hurt
your side as well as ours.]

07:11.120 --> 07:16.000
[See to it that Gideon Avital
approves my brother's resort,]

07:16.240 --> 07:19.640
[and don't forget the armored vehicles
you promised us 20 years ago.]

07:21.520 --> 07:24.000
[Consider it done.
I'm on it.]

07:25.760 --> 07:30.440
[Look, all I know is that
he has meetings with <i>the crazies</i>.]

07:30.600 --> 07:34.740
[But I'm not exactly sure
what he's up to.]

07:34.900 --> 07:36.760
[We'll be in touch.]

07:38.240 --> 07:42.120
[I have three children,
the youngest is five months old,]

07:42.400 --> 07:45.440
[and my brother and I own
an electric supplies shop.]

07:45.960 --> 07:48.120
[Why do you want
to be a Shahid?]

07:48.280 --> 07:52.520
[When I was young, I lived in a room
with Fatah students from <i>Bir Zeit</i>,]

07:52.680 --> 07:55.720
[but since then, I got married
and had children,]

07:55.880 --> 07:58.880
[and sadly, was steered away
from the sacred cause.]

07:59.040 --> 08:01.600
[What made you reconsider?]

08:02.320 --> 08:06.160
[Five years ago
I started having marriage trouble,]

08:06.320 --> 08:08.720
[my wife is a handful,]

08:08.880 --> 08:11.920
[and also, my brother and I started
having business quarrels.]

08:12.360 --> 08:16.520
[I met with the Sheikh, and he patched
things up between my wife and me,]

08:16.680 --> 08:18.800
[and solved my business
problems with my brother.]

08:18.960 --> 08:22.520
[He also told me what the Prophet
expects of us.]

08:22.720 --> 08:25.800
[Since the Sheikh died,
I can't sleep.]

08:26.280 --> 08:28.320
[The Sheikh will be greatly missed.]

08:30.920 --> 08:33.080
[Are you still a Fatah member?]

08:33.240 --> 08:37.360
[No. I realized that the Fatah
doesn't care about its people.]

08:37.600 --> 08:40.160
[-But you're not like them.]
[-That's right.]

08:40.320 --> 08:43.480
[I want my family to get a new house
instead of the one that'll be destroyed,]

08:43.640 --> 08:46.520
[plus a monthly income
of 6,000 shekels.]

08:49.560 --> 08:51.560
[I will have it checked out.]

08:52.880 --> 08:54.600
[But aren't you scared of dying?]

08:54.800 --> 08:57.680
[There is no better fate
than to die a Shahid.]

08:59.160 --> 09:00.760
[That's true.]

09:01.320 --> 09:03.240
[Well, thanks for coming.]

09:03.440 --> 09:07.080
[-I'll be right back.]
[-May God be with you.]

09:14.280 --> 09:15.880
[He's just right, isn't he?]

09:16.040 --> 09:18.080
[-No.]
[-Why not?]

09:18.240 --> 09:19.920
[He's in it for the money.]

09:20.080 --> 09:22.360
[If the Jews gave him 100 shekels,
he'd work for them.]

09:22.520 --> 09:24.600
[We should keep
our distance from him.]

09:24.760 --> 09:27.800
[I want you to find the right man
for the <i>Al Buraq </i>operation.]

09:27.960 --> 09:31.320
[A man who would feel humbled
in the face of death.]

09:32.800 --> 09:34.920
[-Now, leave.]
[-Where to?]

09:35.080 --> 09:36.640
[We're done here.]

09:36.800 --> 09:39.200
[But Abu Ahmad,
it doesn't work that way.]

09:39.520 --> 09:41.560
[You can't stay here.]

09:41.720 --> 09:44.520
[-They could find you any minute.]
[-Things are different now.]

09:44.680 --> 09:47.240
[They strapped an explosive belt
on my kid, they blew up the Sheikh.]

09:47.400 --> 09:51.280
[-I know, but still...]
[-Walid, I'm done living like a rat.]

09:51.440 --> 09:53.640
[If God wants me,
he can take me.]

09:53.880 --> 09:55.600
[That will be all. Go.]

09:56.600 --> 09:58.480
[Get out, now!]

10:03.800 --> 10:06.120
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

10:06.280 --> 10:08.080
[Shut the door, Walid.]

10:11.760 --> 10:13.720
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

10:20.760 --> 10:23.120
[Go with Nidal to Dr. Shirin.]

10:23.280 --> 10:25.640
[She's collaborating with the Jews.]

10:26.560 --> 10:29.600
[Then dump her body
at Almanarah Square.]

10:30.240 --> 10:31.680
[Alright.]

10:41.400 --> 10:42.880
[Thanks.]

11:05.160 --> 11:08.880
[Well, I'll go take a shower.]

11:17.880 --> 11:19.680
<i>[You slut! You're betraying us</i>
<i>with the Jews!]</i>

11:19.840 --> 11:22.320
[It's not me, really,
it's not me.]

11:22.480 --> 11:24.000
[-What is it, pal?]
[-Go back!]

11:24.160 --> 11:25.480
[I said, go back!]

11:30.160 --> 11:31.760
[Who sent you?]

11:32.640 --> 11:34.240
[-Who sent you?]
[-No one.]

11:34.400 --> 11:35.920
[You've got three seconds
to answer.]

11:36.080 --> 11:37.360
[One, two...]

11:37.520 --> 11:39.760
[Abu Ahmad!
Abu Ahmad!]

11:42.600 --> 11:43.960
[Where is he?]

11:44.120 --> 11:44.960
[I don't know.]

11:45.120 --> 11:47.480
[I'll kill you
like I killed your friend.]

11:47.960 --> 11:50.560
[Where is he? Think!]

11:50.720 --> 11:54.360
[-Last time I saw him he was in the hall.]
[-Where is it?]

11:55.480 --> 11:58.880
[If you want to live,
think harder!]

11:59.040 --> 12:01.160
[Yassmin neighborhood,
in Nablus' old city.]

12:01.320 --> 12:03.060
[What is he doing there?]

12:03.220 --> 12:04.320
[What is he doing there?]

12:04.480 --> 12:07.440
[Interviewing volunteers
for carrying out suicide attacks.]

12:07.600 --> 12:10.480
[What do volunteers have to say
when they get there?]

12:10.640 --> 12:13.800
[-What do they say?]
[-They say, "I want to meet the teacher."]

12:13.960 --> 12:17.360
[-<i>The teacher</i>?]
[-Yes, I swear to God.]

12:19.520 --> 12:21.040
[I believe you.]

12:23.040 --> 12:24.720
[Why did you do that?!]

12:24.880 --> 12:26.480
[Your life is in danger,
come with me.]

12:26.640 --> 12:28.680
[-I'm not coming.]
[-Come with me!]

12:36.160 --> 12:39.480
I'll call you right back.
Good morning, can I help you?

12:39.640 --> 12:40.360
No, thanks.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.800
Do you have
an appointment with the Minister?

12:42.960 --> 12:45.520
No, there's no way
I'll make it in time.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.240
I'll get back to you.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.760
Forgot something, Moreno?

12:56.560 --> 12:58.160
Why so smug?

12:58.600 --> 13:01.360
It's been ages since I enjoyed
the morning paper.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.840
They're burying you alive.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.520
All thanks to you.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.000
Sorry to have to say this, Gideon,

13:13.600 --> 13:16.600
but if you don't reassemble
the unit and my team,

13:16.760 --> 13:18.640
I'll have a press conference

13:18.800 --> 13:22.920
and describe in full detail

13:23.200 --> 13:26.720
about the five captives that
you and I shot in the head in Gaza.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.240
Have we resorted
to blackmail, Moreno?

13:30.400 --> 13:33.800
Say what you will, but your
political career will be over.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.480
You'll never shake off the headline
that will hit the newsstands globally:

13:37.640 --> 13:42.680
"The Israeli Defense Minister killed
five Palestinian captives in cold blood."

13:42.840 --> 13:45.960
Did you really think I'd sit back
while you destroy my career?

13:46.120 --> 13:49.120
Is that how you know me after
all these years? You idiot.

13:49.280 --> 13:53.480
I'm the one who swept up
all the shit you left behind.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.320
Never ever forget
who your real friends are.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.600
[-God be with you.]
[-Thank you.]

14:27.760 --> 14:28.960
[We need a room.]

14:29.120 --> 14:30.800
[-One room?]
[-Yes.]

14:32.000 --> 14:33.840
[One bed or two?]

14:34.000 --> 14:36.280
[-Whichever.]
[-So, two.]

14:36.640 --> 14:39.840
[200 shekels a night,
you pay up front.]

14:50.400 --> 14:51.920
[-Thank you.]
[-You're welcome.]

14:52.080 --> 14:52.840
[Come.]

15:17.080 --> 15:19.480
[-Hello?]
[-Walid?]

15:19.640 --> 15:24.200
[Your cousin the doctor just got
a room at my hotel, with a guy.]

15:24.360 --> 15:25.080
[What?!]

15:25.240 --> 15:27.640
[It will really shame your family
when they get word of it.]

15:27.800 --> 15:31.320
[Just shut up and don't tell
anyone about it, you hear?]

16:04.480 --> 16:06.680
[Where's your cousin, that slut?]

16:06.840 --> 16:08.920
[I ask that you please
not call her that.]

16:09.080 --> 16:12.200
[-Why not? Because she's a slut?]
[-What do you want from her?]

16:12.360 --> 16:14.680
[Don't worry,
I have plans for her.]

16:15.880 --> 16:18.960
[Problem is, I sent Bassam and Nidal
over to her, and they're gone.]

16:19.120 --> 16:21.400
[You sent those two lunatics
to her house?]

16:21.920 --> 16:25.360
[-Now you're telling me who to send?]
[-But she's my cousin!]

16:25.520 --> 16:27.680
[I won't let you harm my relatives
without telling me.]

16:27.840 --> 16:29.720
[-Is that so?]
[-Yes.]

16:31.640 --> 16:35.560
[Listen to me, Walid, my friend.
I suggest you calm down,]

16:35.720 --> 16:38.640
[because I will harm anything
that would ruin my plan.]

16:38.800 --> 16:43.160
[-So your plan is to ruin my family?]
[-Anyone who puts it at risk,]

16:43.320 --> 16:44.440
[be it your relative,]

16:44.600 --> 16:48.360
[Abu Samara,
you, or your mother.]

16:48.760 --> 16:50.520
[Understood?]

16:52.440 --> 16:54.360
[Understood?!]

16:54.680 --> 16:56.040
[Understood.]

17:00.680 --> 17:04.120
[So I'm telling you again,
go get your damn cousin]

17:04.280 --> 17:07.720
[and don't come back
until you find her.]

17:25.480 --> 17:27.960
[-How is she?]
[-I don't know.]

17:30.800 --> 17:33.280
[Relax, she's in good hands.]

17:37.360 --> 17:41.120
[After the surgery, do you want me
to buy you all tickets to Berlin?]

17:41.840 --> 17:44.040
[-No.]
[-Why not?]

17:44.200 --> 17:45.760
[I can't.]

17:46.320 --> 17:49.240
[-Because of him?]
[-There is <i>no him</i>.]

17:49.400 --> 17:50.960
[I told you, he's dead.]

17:51.120 --> 17:53.440
[I thought we were
talking seriously.]

17:53.600 --> 17:57.200
[If he were dead,
Abir wouldn't be in this predicament.]

17:59.880 --> 18:02.960
[You know what?
Let's play "pretend".]

18:03.120 --> 18:06.880
[Let's pretend that your husband
is actually dead.]

18:07.360 --> 18:09.760
[You could leave without him.]

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
[You and your children
could be off to Berlin.]

18:12.080 --> 18:13.560
[A new beginning,]

18:13.720 --> 18:17.600
[no Jews, no Arabs,
no war.]

18:19.120 --> 18:21.640
[Suppose I'm interested...]

18:22.080 --> 18:24.760
[What must I do
to make it happen?]

18:27.400 --> 18:29.920
[Help me catch his ghost.]

18:32.240 --> 18:36.080
[This time, your daughter ended up
in a hospital because of him.]

18:36.240 --> 18:38.800
[Who knows how it will end
next time?]

18:39.120 --> 18:41.600
[You can elude death one day,]

18:41.760 --> 18:44.160
[but it will find you
the next day.]

18:44.320 --> 18:47.960
[Besides,
he'd never leave with you.]

18:48.120 --> 18:51.840
[But on the other hand,
he won't let you go alone.]

18:52.000 --> 18:55.920
[Our only hope is to catch him.]

18:56.760 --> 18:58.640
[It's for his own good too.]

18:58.800 --> 19:02.120
[If he's our prisoner,
we can't kill him,]

19:02.280 --> 19:05.160
[and some day
he will be released.]

19:05.520 --> 19:08.960
[They are all released in the end.
We released Sheikh Yassin, too.]

19:09.120 --> 19:10.920
[And then you finished him
with an air strike.]

19:11.080 --> 19:14.160
[A poor old man
in a wheelchair.]

19:14.320 --> 19:16.280
[You will hear God's wrath.]

19:16.600 --> 19:19.440
[-Nassrin, my dear.]
[-Your dear?]

19:21.400 --> 19:25.480
[Listen, I've been divorced twice.]

19:25.640 --> 19:27.560
[I have five children,
God bless them,]

19:27.720 --> 19:29.960
[but I come back
to an empty house,]

19:30.120 --> 19:32.800
[and sleep in a big, cold bed.]

19:32.960 --> 19:35.240
[I'm alone, every day.]

19:35.840 --> 19:38.880
[-If I had a woman like you--]
[-Captain Ayub, please!]

19:40.960 --> 19:43.040
[To each his destiny in life.]

19:43.200 --> 19:45.240
[It's all written
by the hand of Allah.]

19:46.320 --> 19:48.280
[I don't believe in that.]

19:48.440 --> 19:51.360
[One can change
his own destiny.]

19:54.400 --> 19:57.600
[Take your time.
Think about it.]

20:22.040 --> 20:23.840
[What are you doing?]

20:24.280 --> 20:27.160
[-I have to be at work in 40 minutes.]
[-They'll manage without you.]

20:27.320 --> 20:30.440
[-There's no reason for that.]
[-Abu Ahmad could have you killed.]

20:30.600 --> 20:33.760
[Do not go anywhere, and don't
open the door until I come back.]

20:33.920 --> 20:36.920
[But why would Abu Ahmad
want to kill me?]

20:37.080 --> 20:38.760
[I'll talk to him.]

20:40.280 --> 20:42.840
[Sit down.]

20:48.000 --> 20:50.360
[Abu Ahmad thinks
you sold him out to the Jews,]

20:50.520 --> 20:53.880
[and that you put his kid in the hospital
and got the Sheikh killed.]

20:55.920 --> 20:58.280
[Don't hurt my cousin Walid.]

20:58.960 --> 21:00.920
[He's just a foolish boy.]

21:01.080 --> 21:02.960
[Wait for me here.]

22:03.080 --> 22:04.640
[Hello.]

22:04.960 --> 22:06.520
[-May I come in?]
[-Who are you?]

22:06.680 --> 22:09.400
[Samakh Tamimi.
I have a meeting.]

22:09.560 --> 22:12.400
[-With whom?]
[-Wi<i>th the teach</i>er.]

22:25.680 --> 22:27.780
[-God be with you.]
[-Thanks.]

22:27.940 --> 22:29.600
[Spread your arms.]

22:37.200 --> 22:39.280
[-Sit down and wait here.]
[-What for?]

22:39.440 --> 22:40.800
[Until they call you.]

22:41.080 --> 22:44.240
[-How long will it take?]
[-I don't know. You can leave, if you want.]

22:44.400 --> 22:48.320
[-No, I'll wait. Here?]
[-Here.]

23:09.760 --> 23:11.680
[Shirin, open the door.]

23:12.760 --> 23:15.840
[Shirin, I know you're in there,
open the door, it's Walid.]

23:17.640 --> 23:19.840
[How did you know I was here?]

23:20.000 --> 23:22.880
[You can't hide from us.
Open up.]

23:25.280 --> 23:27.440
[-Shirin, open the door.]
[-Why are you here?]

23:27.600 --> 23:29.320
[I need to talk to you.]

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
[Shirin, I would never harm you.]

23:34.800 --> 23:37.960
[I won't do a thing, I swear to God.
Now, open up.]

23:39.760 --> 23:44.080
[Shirin, I'm here to help you.
Open up.]

23:44.240 --> 23:46.200
[You sent people
to have me killed.]

23:46.360 --> 23:49.160
[Do you honestly think
I would do that?]

23:49.320 --> 23:50.320
[Abu Ahmad sent them.]

23:50.480 --> 23:52.840
[He thinks you told the Jews
about the operation.]

23:53.000 --> 23:55.920
[How would I even tell them that?]

23:56.120 --> 23:57.800
[I know nothing about it.]

23:57.960 --> 24:01.560
[I know, that's why
I'm here to help you.]

24:05.000 --> 24:06.720
[Now, open the door.]

24:17.120 --> 24:20.400
[What does he want from me?
Why send people to kill me?]

24:20.560 --> 24:23.280
[Shirin, you must tell me
exactly what went on.]

24:23.440 --> 24:27.120
[-What did those people want from you?]
[-They're dead.]

24:27.960 --> 24:29.920
[How did they die?]

24:30.120 --> 24:31.840
[Amir Mahajne killed them.]

24:32.800 --> 24:33.960
[Who's Amir Mahajne?]

24:34.120 --> 24:35.840
[He's from the
Palestine Preventive Security.]

24:36.000 --> 24:40.040
[-What's he got to do with you?]
[-He protects me for real,]

24:40.200 --> 24:43.000
[unlike you, who got me
involved in this nightmare.]

24:43.160 --> 24:45.160
[Do you really think a guy from
the Palestine Preventive Security,]

24:45.320 --> 24:47.220
[-could shield you from Abu Ahmad?]
[-Yes.]

24:47.380 --> 24:49.700
[-Well, you couldn't be more wrong.]
[-Fine.]

24:49.860 --> 24:53.480
[-Who is he? How does he know you?]
[-It's a long story.]

24:53.880 --> 24:56.000
[What did you tell him?]

24:56.520 --> 24:58.320
[Nothing.]

24:58.640 --> 25:02.840
[So he just happened to be at your place
when Abu Ahmad's men came for you?]

25:03.000 --> 25:06.600
[-Just like that?]
[-I think he just came to see if I'm okay]

25:06.760 --> 25:09.040
[after you blew up the Jew.]

25:10.400 --> 25:13.360
[-Did he touch you?]
[-Excuse me?!]

25:13.520 --> 25:14.920
[Did you sleep with him?
Are you insane?!]

25:15.080 --> 25:16.800
[What are you talking about?!]

25:17.320 --> 25:20.920
[I refused to believe it until I got
to this dingy hotel and found out]

25:21.080 --> 25:23.680
[you're fucking that piece of shit
from the Palestine Preventive Security.]

25:23.840 --> 25:27.600
[Get out of here.
Who do you think you are? Get out!]

25:28.280 --> 25:30.240
[Do you love him?]

25:32.720 --> 25:34.520
[You're out of your mind.]

25:34.680 --> 25:35.880
[Get out of here!]

25:36.040 --> 25:38.920
[-Shame on you!]
[-No, you should be ashamed!]

25:39.680 --> 25:42.300
[Your friend Abu Ahmad
wants me wiped out.]

25:42.460 --> 25:44.960
[I'm the only one
who can protect you.]

25:45.840 --> 25:49.120
[Fine, go ahead,
protect me.]

25:50.120 --> 25:53.720
[You got him into my life,
now get him out.]

26:14.120 --> 26:15.640
[-Hey, Walid.]
[-Hi.]

26:15.800 --> 26:19.240
[We have a volunteer waiting
for an appointment.]

26:19.440 --> 26:22.040
[We checked him out,
he's clear.]

26:22.200 --> 26:24.560
[-Did you check everything?]
[-He's clear.]

26:24.720 --> 26:26.760
[-What's his name?]
[-Samakh Tamimi.]

26:26.920 --> 26:28.960
[-Where from?]
[-Nabi Salih village.]

26:29.120 --> 26:31.560
[His family owns a butcher shop,
I know them.]

26:31.720 --> 26:33.520
[Should he come back
in an hour?]

26:33.680 --> 26:37.200
[-Is he here? Did you tell him?]
[-Yes.]

26:37.360 --> 26:39.760
[Okay, thanks.
Godspeed.]

26:43.800 --> 26:48.200
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-May the all merciful Allah bless you.]

27:04.320 --> 27:06.280
[Do you know
why you're here?]

27:06.440 --> 27:09.120
[I'm here for the sacred cause.]

27:11.720 --> 27:13.560
[It's my time to die.]

27:13.720 --> 27:15.240
[Why are you here?]

27:15.400 --> 27:19.560
[I have no other way
to take revenge on them.]

27:19.720 --> 27:21.600
[But why you of all people?]

27:21.760 --> 27:24.960
[Because they blew up my
brother-in-law right before my eyes.]

27:28.720 --> 27:31.240
[Pieces of his flesh
flew right before my eyes.]

27:32.240 --> 27:35.040
[All that's left for me to do
is to avenge his death.]

27:36.200 --> 27:37.640
[Why?]

27:39.960 --> 27:42.720
[Only then will I find solace.]

27:58.040 --> 28:01.960
[-Sorry to hear that.]
[-Thank you.]

28:07.880 --> 28:09.800
[I'll take it from here.]

28:27.960 --> 28:32.320
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-May the all merciful Allah bless you.]

28:34.920 --> 28:36.880
[I see you're nervous.]

28:37.800 --> 28:41.080
[It's understandable, you're here
for a very complex mission.]

28:41.320 --> 28:43.200
[It's scary.]

28:44.360 --> 28:46.200
[I'm not scared.]

28:48.280 --> 28:52.280
[I know you're not scared.]

28:52.960 --> 28:55.080
[You're not afraid to die.]

28:56.600 --> 28:59.360
[You and death
sleep in the same bed.]

29:04.640 --> 29:07.040
[You've killed before, huh?]

29:09.360 --> 29:10.880
[I have.]

29:13.000 --> 29:15.840
[But death and killing
are two different things.]

29:18.240 --> 29:20.360
[It's my time to die.]

29:24.240 --> 29:26.840
[Is there anything you want
to do before that?]

29:29.240 --> 29:30.280
[No.]

29:32.920 --> 29:35.480
[You're not telling the truth now,
that's a lie.]

29:40.440 --> 29:42.440
[What are you hiding from me?]

29:45.880 --> 29:48.000
[I have no home to go back to.]

29:52.040 --> 29:54.160
[But you have a wife and children.]

29:55.200 --> 29:57.560
[There's no place for me
in my own home.]

29:58.360 --> 30:03.160
[A man has no place at home
after letting down his own family.]

30:08.640 --> 30:10.800
[I'm sure that they love you.]

30:16.400 --> 30:19.720
[I promise that your brother-in-law's
death will be avenged.]

30:19.960 --> 30:22.960
[We can't take this anymore,
we're fed up.]

30:23.560 --> 30:27.880
[I had to make sure you're right for us,
that you won't fall apart at go time.]

30:28.760 --> 30:30.960
[God willing, they'll call you.]

30:31.760 --> 30:35.320
[Be ready around the clock,
and don't leave Nablus.]

30:37.760 --> 30:41.000
[You'll get a call in a few days,
when it's go time.]

30:41.800 --> 30:43.000
[Good.]

30:57.920 --> 31:00.440
[It was an honor to meet you.]

31:01.000 --> 31:02.760
[We will meet again.]

31:17.440 --> 31:19.120
[Got a light?]

31:58.600 --> 32:00.760
[What's your name?]

32:01.280 --> 32:03.400
[Amir Mahajne.]

32:04.600 --> 32:08.280
[Is that so?
Amir Mahajne?]

32:08.440 --> 32:10.840
[Who do you work for,
Amir Mahajne?]

32:11.000 --> 32:12.680
[The Palestine Preventive Security.]

32:18.040 --> 32:21.280
[What's your name
and who do you work for?]

32:21.440 --> 32:24.720
[I'm Amir Mahajne, and I'm from
the Palestine Preventive Security.]

32:24.880 --> 32:27.320
[If you harm me,
my friends will--]

32:36.600 --> 32:40.720
[You jackass, we are
the Palestine Preventive Security!]

32:48.600 --> 32:51.080
[What's the goal of our operation?]

32:51.680 --> 32:52.880
[I don't know.]

32:53.040 --> 32:56.760
[-Where will you get an explosive belt?]
[-I don't know.]

32:57.400 --> 32:59.640
[Did you meet Abu Ahmad
in person?]

33:00.960 --> 33:02.640
[Abu Ahmad is dead.]

33:09.480 --> 33:11.720
[Just wait, you son of a bitch.]

33:12.320 --> 33:14.840
[You'll be confessing
to everything you know,]

33:15.000 --> 33:16.840
[and beyond.]
