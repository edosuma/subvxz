I still feel you've made a long trip
for nothing.

50:26.542 --> 50:28.961
But before I even think about it,

50:30.337 --> 50:33.215
I need to know something right now.

50:33.298 --> 50:35.467
And it's a question for Grace.

50:36.677 --> 50:39.388
You see, when I work with a horse,
it's no good just me doin' it.

50:39.471 --> 50:40.556
The owner's gotta be involved, too.

50:40.639 --> 50:41.723
Well, that'll be a little complicated.

50:41.807 --> 50:44.977
You can make it as complicated
or as easy as you like.

50:45.060 --> 50:47.688
But she's the one
that's gonna be ridin' him. Am I right?

50:49.815 --> 50:50.858
Hey?

50:50.941 --> 50:51.942
Right?

50:54.486 --> 50:56.405
Now, here's the deal.

50:56.488 --> 50:58.949
I don't know that I can do anything.

50:59.032 --> 51:01.285
But I'm prepared to give it a go
if you'll help.

51:01.368 --> 51:02.578

51:03.495 --> 51:06.331
- You have a problem with that?
- Isn't it, like, obvious?

51:08.166 --> 51:10.627
Not to me.
Either you want to or you don't.

51:11.086 --> 51:13.463
- Look, I'll talk to Grace.
- Excuse me. With all due respect,

51:13.547 --> 51:15.340
this is her decision, not yours.

51:17.843 --> 51:21.471
Now, I don't wanna waste
anybody's time here. Mostly mine.

51:24.182 --> 51:27.019
Well, nothin' else to do around here.

51:29.521 --> 51:31.899
That's not good enough.

51:31.982 --> 51:33.233
I can't help you.

51:36.737 --> 51:38.363
What do I have to do?

51:38.906 --> 51:41.199
I said, "What do I have to do?"

51:44.453 --> 51:46.914
DIANE: Well, what does she want?

51:47.247 --> 51:48.957
She wants you
to take care of her horse?

51:49.541 --> 51:51.043
Somethin' like that.

51:51.126 --> 51:52.127
And they're staying in the motel?

51:52.669 --> 51:54.296

Could I have some butter, please?

51:54.379 --> 51:55.547

Doesn't she go to school?

51:59.301 --> 52:00.761
I don't know.

52:00.844 --> 52:03.805
You know, I just think
she's got a lot of nerve showin' up here,

52:03.889 --> 52:06.808

and that child all the way.

she's got a lot of nerve?

52:11.688 --> 52:13.148
Well, hell, I don't know.
Accordin' to Tom,

52:13.231 --> 52:16.151
she's a pretty determined woman.
Must've thought it was worth it.

52:16.234 --> 52:18.570

52:19.613 --> 52:21.949
I guess they'll want feedin',
being out here all day long.

52:22.032 --> 52:23.241
I don't think they'll expect that.

52:23.325 --> 52:24.952
What, they're gonna drive
40 miles into town

52:25.035 --> 52:26.662

52:26.745 --> 52:28.330
- Mixed salad.
- What?

52:29.373 --> 52:32.584
Well, I believe women from New York
eat mixed salads.

52:32.668 --> 52:34.544
- Ain't that right, Tom?
- I believe so.

was more tender than the other.

the best of the time,

to the other.

1:29:30.842 --> 1:29:32.719
I'm gonna kind of close my eyes here
for a little while,

1:29:32.802 --> 1:29:35.638
so keep going till you run out of road.

1:29:36.973 --> 1:29:39.976
(STAMMERS) Uh, I don't think I can.

1:29:40.059 --> 1:29:42.145
It's not a question if you can. You are.

1:30:00.538 --> 1:30:02.123
TOM: Where'd you get Pilgrim from?

1:30:02.999 --> 1:30:04.667
GRACE: We bought him in Kentucky.

1:30:04.792 --> 1:30:07.337
Me and my mom took a trip down there
to see him.

1:30:08.296 --> 1:30:11.007
- Well, that must've been special.
- Yeah.

1:30:17.305 --> 1:30:18.681
Are you afraid of anything,

1:30:19.933 --> 1:30:21.517
Tom Booker?

1:30:24.437 --> 1:30:25.730
Oh, growing old.

1:30:26.356 --> 1:30:28.107
Not being much use.

1:30:33.738 --> 1:30:35.365
- Hey, Grace?
- Hmm?

1:30:36.282 --> 1:30:37.992
What went on out there with Pilgrim?

1:30:47.543 --> 1:30:49.212
See, Grace, I got a problem.

1:30:50.546 --> 1:30:51.923
When I work with a horse,

1:30:53.049 --> 1:30:54.926
I like to know its history.

1:30:55.009 --> 1:30:56.552
Now, most of the times, a horse,
in its own way,

1:30:56.636 --> 1:30:58.012
can pretty much tell you
the whole story.

1:30:58.096 --> 1:30:59.722
But sometimes,
they get so messed up in their head

1:30:59.806 --> 1:31:01.557
that you need more to go on.

1:31:03.768 --> 1:31:05.770
Now, I don't know how you feel
about talking about it.

1:31:05.853 --> 1:31:08.439
And if you don't feel like it, I understand.

1:31:09.941 --> 1:31:14.237
But if I'm gonna figure out
what's going on in his head,

1:31:15.655 --> 1:31:17.448
sure would help me
if I understood exactly

1:31:17.532 --> 1:31:19.409
what happened that day.

1:31:27.709 --> 1:31:29.502
You know, not today.

1:31:29.585 --> 1:31:31.254
Whenever you feel like it.

1:31:32.380 --> 1:31:34.090
I'll leave that up to you.

1:31:47.395 --> 1:31:48.563
Uh-oh.

1:31:54.110 --> 1:31:55.111
The answer's no.

1:31:55.570 --> 1:31:57.113
Haven't even heard the question yet.

1:31:57.196 --> 1:31:58.781
Now, the truth is,
you'd be doing me a real favor.

1:31:59.866 --> 1:32:01.451
I got all these young colts
that need riding.

1:32:01.909 --> 1:32:05.079
Rimrock, here, he's, you know,
he's feeling kind of left out.

1:32:05.455 --> 1:32:06.539
Poor thing.

1:32:07.457 --> 1:32:09.417
He'd be grateful.

1:32:09.500 --> 1:32:11.210
And he'd take real good care with you.

1:32:12.253 --> 1:32:13.379
(SIGHS)

1:32:13.463 --> 1:32:15.089
Is this how you're gonna make me pay
my phone bill?

1:32:15.965 --> 1:32:18.926
No. No, ma'am. That part's extra.

1:32:26.392 --> 1:32:27.477
Oh!

1:32:28.019 --> 1:32:30.271
- Brought you a hat.
- I have a hat.

1:32:31.064 --> 1:32:32.065
I know. I've seen it.

1:32:41.032 --> 1:32:42.492
ANNIE: I think my stirrups
are too long or...

1:32:42.575 --> 1:32:44.410
TOM: No, they're fine.
Just relax your center.

1:32:44.494 --> 1:32:45.995
ANNIE: Yeah.
TOM: Just sitting in a bucket.

1:32:46.287 --> 1:32:49.290
No, it's all coming back, you know.
I mean, I'll be fine.

1:32:49.374 --> 1:32:51.501
Okay, well, then I'll stop talking, then.

1:32:52.752 --> 1:32:54.295
(LAUGHING) No, I didn't mean that. I...

1:32:54.379 --> 1:32:56.756
You know, I've never ridden
western before, so...

1:32:56.839 --> 1:32:59.342
TOM: Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
Just sit the horse.

1:32:59.425 --> 1:33:00.676
- ANNIE: Yeah.
- You have a nice seat.

1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:02.929
- You're doing fine.
- ANNIE: Thank you.

1:33:13.231 --> 1:33:14.690
(NEIGHING)

1:33:18.903 --> 1:33:20.446
(ANNIE LAUGHS)

1:33:20.696 --> 1:33:22.657
- You look good. You feel okay?
- Yeah.

1:33:22.740 --> 1:33:24.992
- Wanna pick it up a little? Okay.
- Yeah.

1:33:30.873 --> 1:33:32.875
TOM: Watch your reins.

1:33:33.042 --> 1:33:35.253
Give him some room.
Let him do the work.

1:34:02.989 --> 1:34:04.824
- Okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

1:34:04.907 --> 1:34:05.908
Let's go.

1:34:12.665 --> 1:34:13.916
(SQUEALING)

1:34:46.866 --> 1:34:48.576
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1:35:24.946 --> 1:35:25.988
I envy your mother.

1:35:28.533 --> 1:35:30.159
I do. (CHUCKLES)

1:35:33.287 --> 1:35:34.330
It must be great

1:35:35.498 --> 1:35:38.084
to be her age
and to be at that point in life

1:35:38.167 --> 1:35:40.503
when you have no more guesswork.

1:35:43.047 --> 1:35:45.466
No more impossible decisions to make.

1:35:46.842 --> 1:35:48.886
And anyway, it doesn't matter,
because all the worries

1:35:48.970 --> 1:35:50.555
and all the wrong turns
that you've made

1:35:50.638 --> 1:35:52.473
are as valuable and

1:35:53.975 --> 1:35:57.603
as cherished as the things
that you did right. I...

1:35:57.728 --> 1:36:00.189
(SIGHING) Oh, it must be such a relief,

1:36:02.692 --> 1:36:04.443
must be such peace in that.

1:36:07.613 --> 1:36:09.198
I don't think
you have to wait to be her age

1:36:09.282 --> 1:36:10.283
to find that kind of peace.

1:36:12.368 --> 1:36:15.121
Yeah, but how would you know,
unless it was all behind you?

1:36:15.997 --> 1:36:18.165
- Do you have it?
- Sometimes.

1:36:18.249 --> 1:36:19.834
Not all the time, but sometimes.

1:36:20.543 --> 1:36:21.752
When?

1:36:22.878 --> 1:36:24.171
Waking up on the ranch in the morning,

1:36:24.255 --> 1:36:26.382
knowing what I'm supposed to do
that day.

1:36:27.383 --> 1:36:28.843
Knowing I'm home.

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:30.845
Hmm.

1:36:32.305 --> 1:36:35.558
I wake up every morning,
and I don't know a damn thing. Was I...

1:36:35.975 --> 1:36:37.226
(SIGHS)

1:36:39.061 --> 1:36:40.187
Was I right to bring her here,

1:36:40.271 --> 1:36:42.440
away from what's familiar,
away from her father,

1:36:42.523 --> 1:36:44.066
her friends?

1:36:46.068 --> 1:36:49.363
(LAUGHING) And the more I try and fix
things, the more everything falls apart.

1:36:50.823 --> 1:36:51.824
Maybe you should let 'em fall.

1:36:55.578 --> 1:36:56.746
No, I can't.

1:36:57.997 --> 1:36:58.998
Why?

1:37:13.095 --> 1:37:14.680
Do you think I was right to come?

1:37:15.973 --> 1:37:17.516
I can't answer that, Annie.

1:37:18.934 --> 1:37:20.102
Mmm.

1:37:20.186 --> 1:37:21.854
Well, I'll know soon enough.

1:37:21.937 --> 1:37:24.231
If I've made a mistake,
Grace'll let me know.

1:37:25.900 --> 1:37:27.318
Well, she's a strong kid.

1:37:28.986 --> 1:37:31.113
She gets that from somebody.

1:37:31.947 --> 1:37:33.240
Mmm-hmm.

1:37:41.374 --> 1:37:44.335
Thank you for all you're doing,
you and your family.

1:37:44.418 --> 1:37:46.295
Letting us stay at the house.

1:37:47.004 --> 1:37:48.506
It wasn't getting much use.

1:37:53.969 --> 1:37:54.970
What was your wife like?

1:37:58.182 --> 1:37:59.600
She had reddish hair.

1:38:00.476 --> 1:38:03.729
Not quite. Almost.
Depended on the light.

1:38:06.065 --> 1:38:07.650
She had green eyes.

1:38:09.151 --> 1:38:11.821
And when she played, that was it.

1:38:13.781 --> 1:38:15.825
Something just went right through me.

1:38:16.909 --> 1:38:19.286
I had never heard music like that
played before.

1:38:21.747 --> 1:38:24.125
And the way she looked
when she played it.

1:38:27.294 --> 1:38:30.256
And then one day, she looked at me
that way, and that was it.

1:38:32.425 --> 1:38:33.968
For both of us.

1:38:37.972 --> 1:38:39.849
I knew she didn't wanna be
a rancher's wife,

1:38:39.932 --> 1:38:41.434
but I wanted to give it a try.

1:38:41.517 --> 1:38:44.103
I thought maybe she could give
music lessons to the kids in town,

1:38:44.186 --> 1:38:45.855
at school maybe.

1:38:46.689 --> 1:38:49.024
And that our kids would grow up
with my brother's kids

1:38:49.108 --> 1:38:50.651
and play together.

1:38:53.612 --> 1:38:54.864
But

1:38:55.156 --> 1:38:57.199
she wasn't happy here.

1:38:57.283 --> 1:38:58.909
"Too much space," she said.

1:39:00.995 --> 1:39:02.955
So, why didn't you stay in Chicago?

1:39:04.331 --> 1:39:05.374
Wasn't enough space.

1:39:08.544 --> 1:39:10.296
It just wasn't meant to be.

1:39:13.299 --> 1:39:15.843
But how did you know, for sure?

1:39:17.303 --> 1:39:20.222
Knowing's the easy part.
Saying it out loud is the hard part.

1:39:24.935 --> 1:39:28.105
Mmm. Seems so obvious now,
doesn't it?

1:39:28.814 --> 1:39:31.400
"We weren't right for each other.
If only we knew then."

1:39:32.151 --> 1:39:35.738
I didn't love her 'cause it was right.
I just loved her.

1:42:03.302 --> 1:42:04.762
Course I have.

1:42:07.181 --> 1:42:09.767
I don't know.
You sure Tom said it's all right?

1:42:10.100 --> 1:42:11.143
You gonna give me a hand or what?

1:42:13.228 --> 1:42:15.022
- You sure?
- Come on.

1:42:16.231 --> 1:42:17.232
Okay.

1:42:18.984 --> 1:42:21.320

Come on, let's go. Annie, I'm so sorry.

We should just get them home to bed.

Joe, did Grace try to ride?

1:46:29.318 --> 1:46:31.570
I expect you should talk
to Grace about that, ma'am.

- Yeah.

Judith was telling me about this boy.
I never even got his name.

1:54:30.965 --> 1:54:33.134
(TEARFULLY) We were gonna go
around the railroad bridge.

1:54:35.887 --> 1:54:39.557
We were laughing about something.
And I don't know what.

1:54:40.892 --> 1:54:44.646
And her horse fell.

1:54:45.021 --> 1:54:47.816
And Judith's foot
was caught in the stirrup.

1:54:50.610 --> 1:54:52.445
And she was so scared.

1:54:59.869 --> 1:55:04.708
And I saw this truck
coming around the turn.

1:55:10.004 --> 1:55:13.007
And it was honking,
trying to get us to move.

1:55:14.676 --> 1:55:18.638
And I tried to grab her reins in,

1:55:19.889 --> 1:55:22.392
to get her horse to move out of the way.

1:55:24.686 --> 1:55:26.896
And the truck started to skid.

1:55:31.609 --> 1:55:34.446
And then there was no time
to do anything.

1:55:40.034 --> 1:55:43.204
And she just disappeared.

1:55:50.545 --> 1:55:52.630
Then it came at Pilgrim and me.

1:55:54.632 --> 1:55:56.926
And Pilgrim reared up at the truck.

1:55:59.637 --> 1:56:01.181
And I fell off.

1:56:06.644 --> 1:56:09.689

Now, I'm not gonna tell you
it's gonna stop feelin' this bad.

But I will tell you
you didn't do anything wrong.

1:56:39.844 --> 1:56:41.846

could've happened to me.

1:56:41.930 --> 1:56:43.807
Or to Frank or to Joey.

1:56:45.475 --> 1:56:50.104
And it doesn't make any sense to try
to figure out why these things happen.

1:56:52.315 --> 1:56:54.609
There was a boy
from the Blackfeet Reservation.

1:56:55.944 --> 1:56:58.780
He used to do some work
around here for a while. Sixteen.

1:56:58.863 --> 1:57:02.575
Strong kid. Good kid. He and I
were really, really good friends.

1:57:03.493 --> 1:57:07.413
One day, he went swimmin' and dove
head first into the lake

1:57:07.497 --> 1:57:12.210
and right into a rock,
and it snapped his neck.

1:57:13.336 --> 1:57:14.838
Paralyzed him.

1:57:16.798 --> 1:57:20.969
And after the accident, I'd look
in on him from time to time.

1:57:23.471 --> 1:57:26.933
But he wasn't there. It was like his mind,

1:57:27.016 --> 1:57:29.602
his spirit, whatever you wanna call it,
just disappeared.

1:57:32.438 --> 1:57:34.482
And the only thing left was just anger.

just went somewhere else.

to hold on.

reared up against that truck?

1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:06.723

You don't seem too upset about it.

It's delayed shock. Or maybe not.

I'm sure I could talk my way
back in there

2:02:01.124 --> 2:02:03.084
or get another magazine someplace.

2:02:03.167 --> 2:02:07.130
But maybe I don't...
I'm just not sure I want to.

2:02:07.755 --> 2:02:11.425
Well, I guess you don't have
to figure it out till you get home.

know what I mean?

2:02:22.895 --> 2:02:26.274
you come right down. Down into it.

2:02:28.276 --> 2:02:30.528

this was the life you wanted?

2:02:31.279 --> 2:02:32.613
(CHUCKLES)

2:02:33.406 --> 2:02:35.449
Well, I was a rancher's daughter.

2:02:36.075 --> 2:02:39.203
I guess it's not too far to go
to becoming a rancher's wife.

2:02:40.746 --> 2:02:42.874
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

about all the things I won't have.

Probably not.

Don't make that man
go through somethin'

clear of in the first place.

he got lost way, way up
in these mountains.

he had discovered a new route

Robert?

I was in the Peace Corps.

went looking for <i>Tubab.</i>

to go to India all by herself,

2:09:02.127 --> 2:09:05.881

and asks where <i>Tubab</i> is.

2:09:14.390 --> 2:09:16.600
And I said, "Right here."
And she said, "You're <i>Tubab?"</i>

2:09:16.684 --> 2:09:19.311

2:32:26.614 --> 2:32:28.866
Mmm-hmm. Is Tom around?

2:32:29.492 --> 2:32:32.078
No, he went to Sheridan
to get some horses.

2:32:32.620 --> 2:32:34.163
He left last night.

2:32:36.624 --> 2:32:37.750
Um...

2:32:40.294 --> 2:32:41.295
When's he coming back?

2:32:42.088 --> 2:32:43.089
I don't rightly know.

2:32:45.049 --> 2:32:47.969
Let me know when you need some help
loading Pilgrim, okay?

2:32:48.052 --> 2:32:49.220
Yeah.

2:32:57.269 --> 2:32:59.814
- What time's your flight?
-12: 15.

2:33:00.481 --> 2:33:02.775
The Bookers
wanna leave for the airport by 9:30.

2:33:05.069 --> 2:33:07.321
You sure
you wanna drive Pilgrim back?

2:33:08.114 --> 2:33:12.410
Well, I already know the way and
it's not like I have a job to rush home to.

2:33:14.286 --> 2:33:16.455
To tell you the truth,
I could use the time alone.

2:33:20.292 --> 2:33:21.293
When are you planning to start?

2:33:21.794 --> 2:33:24.130
Well, I guess I'll leave
when you and Grace go.

2:33:26.507 --> 2:33:27.925
May I make a suggestion?

2:33:28.884 --> 2:33:29.969
What?

2:33:32.096 --> 2:33:33.097
Take your time.

2:33:36.017 --> 2:33:38.686
What's the matter?
You look like there's something wrong.

2:33:41.814 --> 2:33:43.983
I have to tell you something, Annie.

2:33:46.444 --> 2:33:47.903
I stood there looking at that horse

2:33:47.987 --> 2:33:51.323
and I swear I felt like
the same thing was happening to me.

2:33:53.784 --> 2:33:55.578
And I have two choices.

2:33:56.203 --> 2:33:59.040
I can either fight the way things are

2:34:00.958 --> 2:34:02.501
or accept them.

2:34:04.962 --> 2:34:06.130
See...

2:34:08.507 --> 2:34:13.512
I always knew I loved you more.
Didn't bother me.

2:34:14.764 --> 2:34:17.308
I guess I felt kind of lucky.

2:34:17.391 --> 2:34:23.147
Little amazed that a woman like you
would wanna be with a man like me.

2:34:25.858 --> 2:34:27.735
And I guess I thought
if I could do everything right,

2:34:27.818 --> 2:34:32.364
if I was the best husband I could be,
the best father,

2:34:32.490 --> 2:34:36.243
even being a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us.

2:34:36.327 --> 2:34:38.204
If I could do all that,

2:34:39.413 --> 2:34:42.917
it wouldn't make any difference
if we loved each other the same or not.

2:34:46.045 --> 2:34:48.047
I didn't ask for more.

2:34:48.130 --> 2:34:50.382
I told myself I didn't need any more.

2:34:52.259 --> 2:34:57.139
But the truth is,

2:34:58.849 --> 2:35:01.560
you don't know how you feel about me.

2:35:03.354 --> 2:35:06.232
You don't know
if you want a life with me anymore.

2:35:10.069 --> 2:35:12.863
And the truth is,

2:35:15.574 --> 2:35:18.410
I don't want you to come home
until you do know.

2:35:19.787 --> 2:35:21.247
One way or the other.

2:35:23.999 --> 2:35:25.000
Okay?

2:36:07.293 --> 2:36:08.836
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yup.

2:36:16.886 --> 2:36:19.972
Bye, Annie. Good luck to you.

2:36:20.806 --> 2:36:24.393
Thank you. And you, too.

2:36:27.271 --> 2:36:29.148
All right, everybody in.

2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:31.442
- Frank, we all set?
- FRANK: I believe so.

2:36:31.775 --> 2:36:33.485
I can't believe he's not here
to say goodbye.

2:36:33.777 --> 2:36:35.905
FRANK: Oh, he probably
got held up is all.

2:36:35.988 --> 2:36:39.408
DIANE: No, sweetie, the truth is,
he's not real good at goodbyes.

2:36:39.491 --> 2:36:42.828
You know, come to think of it,
not too good at hellos, either.

2:36:42.912 --> 2:36:43.913
(LAUGHING) Frank.

2:36:44.496 --> 2:36:46.373
- Ready?
- I'm just gonna...

2:36:50.711 --> 2:36:51.962
Mmm!

2:36:52.046 --> 2:36:54.340
- When will you be home?
- In a few days.

2:36:54.757 --> 2:36:56.050
I'll miss you.

2:36:56.675 --> 2:36:59.553
Well, if I get lost, you know
where to send the search party.

2:36:59.637 --> 2:37:01.597
- Could be just about anywhere.
-(LAUGHING)

2:37:03.682 --> 2:37:05.392
I'll call you, okay?

2:37:07.353 --> 2:37:08.938
(ENGINE STARTS)

2:37:09.188 --> 2:37:11.565
- Bye.
- Bye.

2:39:32.664 --> 2:39:33.665
(DOOR CREAKS)

2:39:45.386 --> 2:39:48.597
He going back inside the trailer
or running alongside?

2:39:59.149 --> 2:40:00.984
I just wanted to be here when you left.

2:40:01.068 --> 2:40:02.361
(SOBBING)

2:40:05.239 --> 2:40:06.532
(CRYING) I don't want to leave you.

2:40:08.033 --> 2:40:09.118
I don't want you to.

2:40:11.620 --> 2:40:13.414
ANNIE: Just a few more days.

2:40:16.458 --> 2:40:17.668
And then?

2:40:19.545 --> 2:40:20.796
(ANNIE SIGHS)

2:40:25.217 --> 2:40:26.552
(SNIFFLES)

2:40:29.555 --> 2:40:30.556
Why did this happen?

2:40:33.517 --> 2:40:35.436
I don't ask those questions, Annie.

2:40:36.228 --> 2:40:39.857
- And I didn't ask to love you, but I do.
-(SOBBING) Oh...

2:40:40.065 --> 2:40:41.900
TOM: I'll always have that with me.

2:40:46.238 --> 2:40:47.489
Tom...

2:40:59.168 --> 2:41:01.253
Can we have one last ride?

2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:03.005
Hmm?

2:41:06.216 --> 2:41:09.928
Yeah. I'll saddle them up.

2:41:35.704 --> 2:41:37.289
(ENGINE STARTS)

2:42:06.318 --> 2:42:07.694
