WEBVTT

00:02.772 --> 00:04.471
for the Bloom heel from Uncle Joe.

00:04.473 --> 00:07.041
And you've been cheating
on Mom for 20 years

00:07.043 --> 00:08.609
with a woman named Chanterelle.

00:08.611 --> 00:09.909
I mean, what is that? A mushroom?

00:09.910 --> 00:12.146
<i>- Where'd you get this?
- Eva left it in the freezer.</i>

00:12.148 --> 00:13.456
<i>Screw it.</i>

00:13.549 --> 00:15.382
Poor schmuck.

00:15.384 --> 00:17.785
<i>That was quite a night.
We should do it again tonight.</i>

00:17.787 --> 00:20.788
And then definitely Friday
after your birthday party.

00:20.790 --> 00:23.023
- My God!
- I cannot believe

00:23.025 --> 00:26.327
- my baby sister is turning 30.
- Happy birthday.

00:26.329 --> 00:28.028
Hey, I have a question.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.697
What the f...
do you think you're doing here?

00:29.699 --> 00:31.165
Not leaving until we get our money.

00:31.167 --> 00:33.234
You came here to chase a phantom.

00:33.236 --> 00:36.036
There's no Ava, there's no Cece,

00:36.038 --> 00:37.905
<i>there's no Alice and there's no money.</i>

00:37.907 --> 00:39.406
- Not ever.
- So you just throw

00:39.408 --> 00:40.808
your heart around like it's nothing.

00:40.810 --> 00:42.309
Maybe it's different this time.

00:42.311 --> 00:44.144
- Maybe he's not just a mark.
- Thanks, Gaby.

00:44.146 --> 00:45.346
You know I'd be lost without you.

00:45.348 --> 00:46.881
- You're welcome.
- Ezra!

00:46.883 --> 00:49.817
Stop flirting and get your
skinny ass in my office.

00:51.529 --> 00:52.340
What's the matter?

00:52.375 --> 00:54.555
- Is this good?
- Maybe if you, you know,

00:54.557 --> 00:58.626
- talked with an accent.
- Do you wanna make love to me?

01:01.597 --> 01:04.932
- What happened to your face?
- I saw Ava at the airport,

01:04.934 --> 01:07.768
<i>- dressed as somebody else.
- I thought this weekend</i>

01:07.770 --> 01:09.536
I'd take you for a little getaway.

01:09.538 --> 01:11.272
- My God.
- Don't you wanna know

01:11.274 --> 01:13.774
- where we're going?
- Anywhere that's away with you

01:13.776 --> 01:15.409
is exactly where I wanna be.

01:15.411 --> 01:17.077
He's an assignment, sweetie pie.

01:17.079 --> 01:18.746
<i>Yeah, the Doctor called it in.</i>

01:18.748 --> 01:19.914
<i>He says that Patrick
Campbell could be one of</i>

01:19.916 --> 01:21.849
<i>our biggest scores in years.</i>

01:21.851 --> 01:23.284
Not in a million years, Max.

01:23.286 --> 01:25.386
This is the life we chose.
There are rules.

01:25.388 --> 01:26.887
<i>We don't get to break them
because we're stupid enough</i>

01:26.889 --> 01:28.622
<i>- to fall in love.
- Man, she grew up here</i>

01:28.624 --> 01:30.958
<i>in this house, played in that yard.</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:33.727
<i>Dad had a heart attack.
You need to come home.</i>

01:33.729 --> 01:35.596
I really think it's a stupid idea.

01:35.598 --> 01:37.598
She chose this life. Patrick didn't.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.699
<i>What if somebody could have come to you,</i>

01:38.701 --> 01:39.700
<i>could have stopped it?</i>

01:39.702 --> 01:41.402
<i>I'm going.</i>

02:15.771 --> 02:18.038
What are you doing?

02:23.512 --> 02:25.846
This was the worst
decision we ever made.

02:25.848 --> 02:28.482
- What? Getting married?
- No.

02:31.187 --> 02:34.088
No, that's the best one.

02:34.090 --> 02:35.823
No, I mean coming here,
telling my parents.

02:35.825 --> 02:38.692
They may actually murder us.

02:38.694 --> 02:41.462
Hey, you're tougher than you think.

02:44.633 --> 02:48.702
You have to stop
apologizing for who you are.

02:48.704 --> 02:50.337
Okay?

02:51.560 --> 02:53.007
Okay, that's them.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.277
Fuck it, I say we run,

02:57.279 --> 03:00.814
- right now.
- We're not running.

03:00.816 --> 03:03.784
I got you. You got me.

03:05.287 --> 03:06.887
We got this.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.827
- Hey. Get in the car.
- Screw you.

03:13.829 --> 03:15.496
- Jules, get in the car.
- No.

03:15.498 --> 03:17.731
I have to tell you something crucial.

03:17.733 --> 03:20.134
- Mind-blowing.
- Well, tell me.

03:20.136 --> 03:22.736
- Patrick's in the FBI.
- No, he isn't!

03:22.738 --> 03:24.571
I followed him to the
goddamn headquarters,

03:24.573 --> 03:26.340
I looked down on the
goddamn seal and it said.

03:26.342 --> 03:29.209
Federal goddamn Burrow of Investigation!

03:39.889 --> 03:41.989
Did you say "Burrow"?

03:47.830 --> 03:51.198
I impersonated a
bartender at an FBI party.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.200
Pretty sure you're not
gonna serve time for that.

03:53.202 --> 03:55.169
We stole cash, we stole credit cards.

03:55.171 --> 03:57.704
Frickin' plane tickets!

03:57.706 --> 03:59.873
How long has that car been behind us?

03:59.875 --> 04:02.943
- It looks suspicious.
- Crap.

04:02.945 --> 04:05.446
Feds drive American cars. That's them.

04:05.448 --> 04:07.848
What the hell are you doing?
Just be cool.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.616
I am being cool! Stop making me nervous!

04:09.618 --> 04:11.585
I'm not responsible for your
emotional... Wait, wait, wait.

04:11.587 --> 04:13.020
- They're turning.
- They are?

04:13.022 --> 04:15.689
My God.

04:15.691 --> 04:17.357
- We're being crazy people.
- My God.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.760
- We're fine.
- My God. We're okay.

04:19.762 --> 04:22.096
We're fine. Totally fine.
We're gonna just...

04:22.098 --> 04:24.798
We'll go back to the motel,
we'll formulate a plan.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.867
Call Ezra. He'll know what to do.

04:26.869 --> 04:29.937
Unless they bugged our room.

04:29.939 --> 04:31.438
Shit, they totally bugged our room.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.273
Shit.

04:33.275 --> 04:34.942
Then who's to say
they didn't bug our car?

04:48.620 --> 04:50.924
- I'm not talking!
- Shh!

04:52.761 --> 04:55.062
Don't touch me.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.145
Well, lookee here.
Saffron must have stayed over.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.596
Yeah, sweetest
undercover gig of all time.

05:29.827 --> 05:31.165
- Someday, I'm gonna...
- Don't blow smoke

05:31.167 --> 05:34.601
- up a senior agent's ass.
- Gina. Don't be bitter.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.044
Go ahead.

05:40.809 --> 05:42.743
Can you explain this to me, please?

05:42.745 --> 05:45.145
The fact that the largest
law enforcement agency

05:45.147 --> 05:47.714
in the country is still
using a dot matrix printer?

05:47.716 --> 05:50.384
You are way over budget again.

05:50.386 --> 05:52.219
If we are not within striking distance

05:52.221 --> 05:55.822
of the Doctor very, very soon,
we are shutting you down.

05:55.824 --> 05:59.693
You are not the only cock on the block.

05:59.695 --> 06:03.530
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

06:03.532 --> 06:05.766
And where's the intel on this one?

06:05.768 --> 06:07.701
We're pretty sure she's
just a civilian and...

06:07.703 --> 06:11.605
Pretty sure? That isn't quite up
to Bureau standards, now, is it?

06:11.607 --> 06:13.907
- No, ma'am.
- And the puppy dog?

06:13.909 --> 06:15.942
He's definitely in it.
Just looking for the angle.

06:15.944 --> 06:20.013
Well, I wait with baited breath.

06:20.015 --> 06:22.749
You have the nicest of days, now.

06:26.422 --> 06:27.601
Just...

06:29.024 --> 06:32.125
Just take it easy on the credit card.

06:43.439 --> 06:45.138
Here you go, my lady.

06:50.212 --> 06:52.479
- Thank you.
- Sometimes you just gotta say,

06:52.481 --> 06:54.948
"Screw it." Get away from it all.

07:09.664 --> 07:12.163
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to begin our descent</i>

07:12.198 --> 07:14.835
<i>into Indianapolis International Airport.</i>

07:14.837 --> 07:16.269
<i>Please turn off all...</i>

07:16.271 --> 07:19.406
You almost home or
almost away from home?

07:19.408 --> 07:21.842
- Pardon me?
- Are you visiting Indy

07:21.844 --> 07:25.312
- or going home?
- Kinda both, I guess.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.013
I moved away 25 years ago.

07:27.015 --> 07:28.915
I only come back to visit my mother.

07:28.917 --> 07:31.785
But every time,
she still tries to draw me in for good.

07:31.787 --> 07:33.954
- Like quicksand made of doilies.
- Well, my family's

07:33.956 --> 07:36.189
been in Indianapolis three generations.

07:36.191 --> 07:37.791
There's great comfort being with family.

07:37.793 --> 07:40.293
Yeah. It's called the easy way out.

07:40.295 --> 07:41.995
There's a whole world out there, son.

07:41.997 --> 07:44.498
You don't leave home, you never change.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.266
That's ridiculous.
My wife and I, we just...

07:46.268 --> 07:48.034
<i>Folks, we're now making
our final descent</i>

07:48.036 --> 07:49.603
<i>- into Indianapolis.
- We're taking a trip to Rome.</i>

07:49.605 --> 07:51.338
Yeah, take all the trips you want.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.039
People back home will see you the way...

08:11.421 --> 08:12.854
Hello?

08:18.462 --> 08:19.594
Mom?

08:38.448 --> 08:39.448
Dad!

08:46.356 --> 08:48.456
Yeah!

08:48.458 --> 08:49.991
Man.

08:49.993 --> 08:51.459
- It's about time!
- Hey, excuse me?

08:51.461 --> 08:52.727
Didn't you just have a heart attack?

08:52.729 --> 08:55.630
I sure as hell thought so, Ez.

08:55.632 --> 08:58.967
I had shooting pains.
My whole chest seized up.

08:58.969 --> 09:01.569
I was laying there on the
floor of the show room, they...

09:01.571 --> 09:03.705
I can't believe I'm going out like this.

09:03.707 --> 09:05.507
- It was damn scary, Ez.
- Right, Josh said

09:05.509 --> 09:07.409
- you were touch-and-go.
- Turns out it was

09:07.411 --> 09:09.744
a massive panic attack.

09:09.746 --> 09:11.680
According to Dr. Shipper,
probably because of

09:11.682 --> 09:14.049
all the family drama of late.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.317
You're, blaming me
for your fake heart attack?

09:16.319 --> 09:18.753
Can't you just be glad the
old man is still standing?

09:18.755 --> 09:20.355
I'm glad you're okay, Dad.

09:20.357 --> 09:22.490
Anyway, it was a good excuse
to get your ass back home

09:22.492 --> 09:24.859
because I have a big announcement.

09:24.861 --> 09:27.495
Jesus. Email me.

09:27.497 --> 09:29.764
Hey.

09:29.766 --> 09:31.032
Whoa, Dad. You shouldn't be up.

09:31.034 --> 09:33.168
Shut up. I know.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.836
Comes all the way back
from God knows where

09:34.838 --> 09:36.905
and doesn't even wanna
hear my big announcement.

09:36.907 --> 09:38.773
Dude, come on.
You can take one night off

09:38.775 --> 09:40.241
from searching for your wife.

09:40.243 --> 09:42.243
- Not wife.
- I'm not searching for her.

09:42.245 --> 09:44.412
- I found her.
- No way.

09:44.414 --> 09:46.181
Infiltrated her new life.

09:46.183 --> 09:49.017
I confronted her.
She's called "Saffron" now.

09:49.019 --> 09:51.753
- Infiltrated?
- Did you get your money?

09:51.755 --> 09:53.121
- That's next.
- But she warned you

09:53.123 --> 09:54.456
not to come after her.

09:54.458 --> 09:58.059
I mean, is... is it safe?

09:58.061 --> 09:59.360
What do you mean, safe?

09:59.362 --> 10:01.296
I'm handling it.

10:07.804 --> 10:10.472
You're here.

10:10.474 --> 10:14.075
Sweetie, I told them
it was a terrible idea,

10:14.077 --> 10:17.378
but I'm so happy to see you.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.380
- Hi, Mom.
- Wait till you hear

10:19.382 --> 10:20.949
what your father has planned.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.917
- Yeah, about that, I...
- No, don't even ask.

10:22.919 --> 10:24.753
- I'm sworn to secrecy.
- Okay.

10:24.755 --> 10:26.454
But come. Come, come, come.

10:26.456 --> 10:30.325
Every day I find myself
walking towards your office

10:30.327 --> 10:32.093
to tell you something,
and then I realize

10:32.095 --> 10:33.461
that you're not there.

10:33.463 --> 10:35.630
So then I started
writing everything down.

10:35.632 --> 10:38.666
- It's ridiculous, really.
- No. It's... it's sweet.

10:38.668 --> 10:40.502
All right, number one. "Articles."

10:40.504 --> 10:42.570
- Articles.
- I have clipped all of these

10:42.572 --> 10:45.573
inspiring stories about
people starting over.

10:45.575 --> 10:46.941
You know, they have this thing

10:46.943 --> 10:48.810
- called the Internet now.
- Stop.

10:48.812 --> 10:52.981
All right. What is next?
"Purple... purple floozy."

10:52.983 --> 10:54.682
- That can't be right.
- Mrs. Kirhoffer.

10:54.684 --> 10:58.186
- Yes! She got married again.
- No!

10:58.188 --> 11:01.656
And she's still seeing
what's-his-face from that...

11:01.658 --> 11:03.291
- Um...
- The place...

11:03.293 --> 11:04.659
- What is the place?
- Mr. Windmiller.

11:04.661 --> 11:06.861
The sleazy wedding DJ guy.
With the beige van.

11:06.863 --> 11:08.163
Yes! Exactly.

11:08.165 --> 11:10.298
My God. Honey.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.847
I have missed you.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.783
I missed you too, Mom.

11:30.353 --> 11:31.635
Come on.

11:33.356 --> 11:36.157
This place is amazing.

11:36.159 --> 11:37.931
Especially the view.

11:39.496 --> 11:41.296
Hey, what, are you checking out my ass?

11:41.488 --> 11:43.898
You love it.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.977
I do, I do.

11:46.636 --> 11:48.647
All right, 1:00.

11:50.006 --> 11:51.973
- All right, what's your guess?
- Mother/daughter.

11:51.975 --> 11:54.909
Mother's idea.
She wants them to get close

11:54.911 --> 11:57.645
so she's making them
spend time together.

11:57.647 --> 12:00.582
Disagree. Daughter's idea.

12:00.584 --> 12:03.318
Really? Explain.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.520
Well, daughter's gear
is fully broken in.

12:05.522 --> 12:07.355
Mom's is brand-new.

12:07.357 --> 12:10.225
This is daughter's attempt
to bring mom into her world.

12:10.227 --> 12:13.828
- You're good.
- You got no idea, baby.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.697
- Left? Right?
- Let's go left.

12:19.824 --> 12:21.269
Why do you even ask?

12:21.271 --> 12:24.606
Always forward, never back, baby.

12:28.545 --> 12:30.178
Hey, you know,
you can answer that if you want.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.513
I mean, it's not super outdoorsy,
but still.

12:32.515 --> 12:33.677
Not important.

12:35.218 --> 12:36.918
Okay.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.119
What do we think?

12:38.121 --> 12:40.088
- Good morning.
- Morning.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.590
- Definitely a couple.
- Yep.

12:42.592 --> 12:44.859
Boredom in his eyes, semi-hate in hers.

12:44.861 --> 12:47.929
- Ouch. Really?
- Caught her eye.

12:47.931 --> 12:50.865
She's pretending to have
fun to make things easier.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.268
You're so cynical.

12:53.270 --> 12:55.737
Everyone's pretending something.

12:55.739 --> 12:57.572
Even with people they love?

12:57.574 --> 12:59.807
Especially with people they love.

12:59.809 --> 13:01.943
It's out of kindness.

13:01.945 --> 13:05.747
No one needs to know every single thing
that goes on in your head.

13:05.749 --> 13:07.615
Well, then how do you get
to know someone?

13:07.617 --> 13:10.785
I mean really know 'em
if we're always pretending?

13:10.787 --> 13:13.588
Well, maybe you just accept
that you can't.

13:13.590 --> 13:17.158
And maybe it's even romantic

13:17.160 --> 13:21.829
to shape ourselves for the
people we love and vice versa.

13:24.301 --> 13:26.968
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm buying that.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.636
Me neither, but it sounds good.

13:28.638 --> 13:32.040
It does sound good. It does.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.742
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you can get lucky

13:34.744 --> 13:38.046
and meet that one person that...

13:41.952 --> 13:43.140
That what?

13:44.788 --> 13:46.156
Nothing.

13:59.456 --> 14:02.937
This totally would
have been my life with Alice.

14:02.939 --> 14:05.573
Then consider yourself
lucky Alice wasn't real.

14:07.677 --> 14:10.378
Hey, Jules. Hey, maybe we should just

14:10.380 --> 14:12.547
- look for a lawyer out here.
- No, Richard.

14:12.549 --> 14:15.316
No insecurity. Okay?

14:15.318 --> 14:18.987
They smell it like blood in the water
and then they eat you alive.

14:18.989 --> 14:21.222
Jesus. I sound like my mother.

14:25.161 --> 14:26.828
Hello.

14:26.830 --> 14:29.063
Richard and I are in
Seattle for the weekend

14:29.065 --> 14:31.332
and I've been told our
clubs have reciprocity.

14:31.334 --> 14:33.301
Ours being the Prescott, back east.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.536
I am so sorry,
the Laneview Club doesn't engage

14:35.538 --> 14:38.039
in reciprocal relationships.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.841
You know what my Grammy
Langmore would say

14:39.843 --> 14:43.745
if she were alive to see reciprocity
go the way of the dodo?

14:43.747 --> 14:47.482
"What, dear Lord,
is the world coming to?"

14:47.484 --> 14:49.884
Would that be the Connecticut Langmores?

14:52.555 --> 14:55.089
Would that make it easier
for you to do your job?

14:57.193 --> 14:58.659
Welcome.

15:08.789 --> 15:10.590
So what's going on with you?

15:10.592 --> 15:12.292
Still dating Stacey

15:12.294 --> 15:14.761
and Emily and both Ashleys?

15:14.763 --> 15:16.863
- Dink was here last week.
- Dink?

15:16.865 --> 15:18.831
Dink, Dink, Dink!

15:18.833 --> 15:20.700
Man, I always wished
people would chant my name

15:20.702 --> 15:22.602
when I walked into a room.

15:22.604 --> 15:24.871
He's on his way to Denmark.

15:24.873 --> 15:26.673
He's gonna open up some
international office

15:26.675 --> 15:28.875
- for his company.
- What does he do?

15:28.877 --> 15:31.144
- Sales?
- Consulting or some bullshit.

15:31.146 --> 15:32.812
Who cares?

15:32.814 --> 15:34.480
He's gonna be in charge of shit.

15:34.482 --> 15:36.182
- Dink.
- So?

15:36.184 --> 15:37.817
It's just...

15:37.819 --> 15:39.319
Maybe I was supposed to
do something like that,

15:39.321 --> 15:40.507
you know?

15:41.656 --> 15:45.058
- Bigger.
- So do it.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.493
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:47.495 --> 15:48.833
I don't know.

15:50.131 --> 15:53.166
All right.
Up for a little old-school "Sonic"?

15:53.168 --> 15:55.001
If you're up for losing, then, yeah.

15:55.003 --> 15:56.903
- All right.
- Yeah.

15:56.905 --> 15:58.538
Hey, did Ava ever ask about me?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.006
Yeah, she asked about your nose.

16:00.008 --> 16:01.174
- I'm kidding!
- Idiot.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.675
Kidding, bro.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.180
Okay, you can't spit
in a place like this

16:07.182 --> 16:09.549
without hitting a lawyer,
so we should be able to get out quick.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.217
- Yeah.
- Cucumber water?

16:11.219 --> 16:14.087
- No.
- Lovely. Thank you.

16:17.258 --> 16:18.925
Okay, seriously.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.360
Can you stop jizzing all over yourself?

16:20.362 --> 16:21.994
It's just people with money.

16:21.996 --> 16:24.063
Only a rich person would say,
"Just people with money."

16:24.065 --> 16:25.619
I'm not rich.

16:26.868 --> 16:29.569
- I'm no longer rich.
- I get it.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.270
Fancy yourself an artist type person.

16:31.272 --> 16:33.072
I fancy myself?

16:33.074 --> 16:36.008
What, money makes you
not as good at art?

16:36.010 --> 16:37.844
- That's on you, dude.
- Okay, listen.

16:37.846 --> 16:40.213
You don't understand these people, okay?

16:40.215 --> 16:42.882
If you don't fit the mold,
they destroy you.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.184
They destroy you?

16:45.186 --> 16:47.387
You sound like a teenage girl. Grow up.

16:47.389 --> 16:49.255
You grow up. Money isn't magic.

16:49.257 --> 16:51.023
Magical power to pay your rent on time,

16:51.025 --> 16:53.092
- fix your car when it breaks.
- I'm not talking about

16:53.094 --> 16:55.795
money for living, okay?

16:55.797 --> 16:58.431
I'm talking about wealth.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.600
Coaster?

17:00.602 --> 17:01.567
Thank you.

17:01.569 --> 17:03.536
You call it wealth.

17:03.538 --> 17:05.637
I call it the shortcuts
that you got that I didn't.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.273
- I am not some...
- Hey, when I started working

17:08.276 --> 17:11.109
at the car dealership,
you know what the first thing

17:11.112 --> 17:12.878
- I bought was?
- Some gruel to quiet

17:12.881 --> 17:14.547
- your rumbling tummy?
- A Rolex.

17:14.549 --> 17:16.549
Used... "vintage," they called it.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.317
Thing was busted and the
hands didn't even move

17:18.319 --> 17:19.618
and I couldn't afford to fix it.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.454
But when I wore that thing,

17:21.455 --> 17:23.489
people looked at me differently.

17:23.491 --> 17:24.957
Okay? I sold more cars in that first...

17:24.959 --> 17:26.559
Okay, see? You're making my point.

17:26.560 --> 17:31.597
It's stupid to let other people decide
what is okay and what's not.

17:31.599 --> 17:33.399
- That's easy for you to say.
- Okay, um,

17:33.401 --> 17:34.901
I'm gonna find us a
lawyer and you get us

17:34.903 --> 17:37.603
- something real to drink.
- Will do, m'lady.

17:44.078 --> 17:45.411
Afternoon, sir.

17:45.413 --> 17:46.746
Afternoon.

17:46.748 --> 17:48.414
What are you in the mood for?

17:49.198 --> 17:50.683
You have anything with gin?

17:50.685 --> 17:52.852
Might I recommend
the Constable's Lament?

17:52.854 --> 17:56.656
Gin, shaved ginger, cumin.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.424
How about just a gin and tonic?

17:58.426 --> 18:00.793
Yes, sir.

18:04.999 --> 18:06.532
It's ridiculous, right?

18:06.534 --> 18:07.800
I mean, how complicated
does it have to be

18:07.802 --> 18:11.137
- to do some day drinking?
- Yeah, man.

18:11.139 --> 18:13.306
- Yeah, just a G-and-T for me.
- Exactly.

18:13.308 --> 18:15.274
- Yeah.
- I'm Kurt Radcliffe.

18:15.276 --> 18:18.778
- Richard... James.
- Is Anne James your sister?

18:18.780 --> 18:21.347
Afraid not.
No, I'm visiting from back east.

18:21.349 --> 18:23.282
- You a member here?
- Yeah.

18:23.284 --> 18:25.818
I had my first drink right
here at this very bar.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.321
- Wow.
- Yeah. My grampy slipped me

18:28.323 --> 18:30.623
- the last of his Scotch.
- That's awesome.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.959
Well, I was six. He was an asshole.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.280
I'm kidding.

18:34.996 --> 18:36.362
- Actually, I'm not kidding.
- Sure.

18:36.364 --> 18:38.898
He was an asshole, but whatever.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.190
Family is family.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.468
So what do you do?

18:42.470 --> 18:45.371
And I thought, there's no way
this jury's gonna see it our way.

18:45.373 --> 18:46.973
Then all of a sudden, this guy comes in.

18:47.519 --> 18:49.408
I had them eating out of my hand.

18:49.410 --> 18:52.879
- You looking for someone?
- Yeah, a lawyer.

18:53.584 --> 18:55.047
Well...

18:55.049 --> 18:57.416
you've certainly come
to the right place.

18:57.418 --> 18:59.385
- Just look for somebody...
- Who thinks

18:59.387 --> 19:01.754
their opinion is worth $700 an hour.

19:01.756 --> 19:04.023
Well, you clearly know
what you're doing.

19:04.025 --> 19:05.658
You mind if I smoke?

19:05.660 --> 19:07.460
Only if you don't share.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.667
Can we smoke in here?

19:14.669 --> 19:18.070
No. But it really pisses them off.

19:22.010 --> 19:24.377
So you're getting a divorce.

19:24.379 --> 19:26.245
Young woman looking for a lawyer.

19:26.247 --> 19:28.915
No, my marriage split up
a couple years ago.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.018
Yeah, I did that dance twice myself.

19:32.020 --> 19:33.753
Two exes.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.788
One that I like
but never get to talk to.

19:35.790 --> 19:38.190
The other one I can't stand.
Have lunch with him every week.

19:38.192 --> 19:39.625
Do you still see him?

19:39.627 --> 19:42.862
Actually, she wasn't
who I thought she was.

19:42.864 --> 19:46.365
She?

19:46.367 --> 19:48.734
That's one I never tried.

19:50.138 --> 19:52.572
Call the lady!

19:52.574 --> 19:54.307
Nailed it.

19:54.309 --> 19:55.942
It was really something,
you should have...

19:55.944 --> 19:58.377
That one.

19:58.379 --> 20:00.646
Hollis McCallister.

20:00.648 --> 20:02.582
Yeah, he's one of the best
lawyers in Seattle.

20:02.584 --> 20:04.784
- You know him?
- He's good.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.285
But I'm better.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.290
Come on. I had to make sure
that I liked you first.

20:14.395 --> 20:16.128
What do you need?

20:28.682 --> 20:29.723
Ezra?

20:30.279 --> 20:31.243
Ezra?

20:31.245 --> 20:34.347
Hey, I know you.

20:34.349 --> 20:36.282
Ezra, stop. Ezra!

20:38.753 --> 20:41.153
Excuse me?

20:41.155 --> 20:43.956
That was for the dog, not you.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.925
Well, when you disappeared,
he needed a home.

20:45.927 --> 20:50.029
So I bought him and I named him Ezra.

20:51.254 --> 20:53.499
Ezra, come here.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.201
Come on.

20:55.203 --> 20:57.203
Ezra, roll over.

20:57.205 --> 20:59.438
Roll over.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.073
Another Ezra that doesn't listen to me.

21:01.075 --> 21:02.195
That's the story of my life.

21:02.608 --> 21:03.843
Okay.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.946
- What are you doing here?
- Your father invited me.

21:06.948 --> 21:08.981
Said he had some sort of
big announcement to make.

21:08.983 --> 21:11.217
- Yes, so I've heard.
- Yeah, and I'm doing your job

21:11.219 --> 21:13.152
- at the company now, so...
- Really?

21:13.154 --> 21:14.787
No one... no one told me that.

21:14.789 --> 21:18.457
Well, you never call to check in, so...

21:18.459 --> 21:22.194
Right, um, well, I have to say,
I'm glad you went back.

21:22.196 --> 21:24.997
Yeah, me too. I just had to,
like, do my thing, you know?

21:24.999 --> 21:27.566
I learned to tap dance,
I learned photography.

21:27.568 --> 21:29.568
- You made cheese.
- I made cheese.

21:29.570 --> 21:31.337
Yes, I did. I made cheese.

21:31.683 --> 21:36.142
But then I woke up one morning
and I was just like, I'm good.

21:36.144 --> 21:37.710
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:37.712 --> 21:39.245
And then I called your parents
and your job was open

21:39.247 --> 21:41.080
and that was a big promotion for me.

21:41.082 --> 21:44.717
And I somehow convinced
them to let me try it.

21:44.719 --> 21:48.020
I bet you're doing really great.

21:48.022 --> 21:51.691
Yeah, I am. Thank you.

21:52.700 --> 21:53.700
Ezra, come!

21:54.796 --> 21:57.352
- Don't even say it.
- I was not going to.

21:57.865 --> 21:59.298
Ezra!

22:08.676 --> 22:11.844
Somebody get me Agent
Simons on the phone!

22:11.846 --> 22:13.079
Right now!

22:19.187 --> 22:22.121
Hey. Do you know what doesn't
go with romantic getaways?

22:22.123 --> 22:24.090
<i>- Calls from your coworkers.
- First off,</i>

22:24.092 --> 22:25.891
do not ignore my phone calls.

22:25.893 --> 22:27.893
It's rude. And second, how close are we?

22:27.895 --> 22:29.862
<i>- I'm getting a lot of pressure.
- You're under pressure?</i>

22:29.864 --> 22:31.597
No disrespect,
but I'm the one who's out here

22:31.599 --> 22:32.965
with his ass on the line.

22:32.967 --> 22:34.266
<i>Now listen to me, Agent Simons...</i>

22:34.268 --> 22:36.035
Look, Agent Cook, I made a choice.

22:36.037 --> 22:37.436
<i>- Ha!
- One that I'm confident</i>

22:37.438 --> 22:39.071
will yield results very soon.

22:39.073 --> 22:40.272
<i>A million-dollar choice.</i>

22:40.274 --> 22:41.874
Here I was, worried about your job.

22:41.876 --> 22:43.476
Now I'm worried about mine.

22:43.478 --> 22:45.778
<i>- How soon?
- Any minute now.</i>

22:45.780 --> 22:48.280
<i>- I can see it in his eyes.
- Well, I hope so.</i>

22:48.282 --> 22:50.382
Because you know what else
can ruin a romantic weekend?

22:50.384 --> 22:51.817
A visit from the Doctor.

22:51.819 --> 22:54.754
The Doctor gets his money,
we get our lives.

22:54.756 --> 22:56.455
I know, I know.

22:56.457 --> 22:59.058
Take down the Doctor,
we reclaim the money,

22:59.060 --> 23:01.994
we get our medals, and I go home.

23:01.996 --> 23:04.663
Get it done, Agent Simons. Soon.

23:04.665 --> 23:06.832
- Consider that an order.
- Finish it.

23:06.834 --> 23:08.634
It's time to put this
shitty chapter behind us

23:08.636 --> 23:10.102
<i>and blow out of this town.</i>

23:10.104 --> 23:11.804
Absolutely.

23:17.188 --> 23:20.624
So my cousin and her friends
used quite a bit of grit

23:20.626 --> 23:22.793
and intelligence to find this woman,

23:22.795 --> 23:25.863
but in order to actually
get to her, well,

23:25.865 --> 23:27.364
they have to do a
bunch of illegal stuff.

23:27.366 --> 23:30.367
Just to pay for travel, etcetera.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.336
And then they find out that the FBI

23:32.338 --> 23:35.239
has been onto this con woman
for quite some time.

23:35.241 --> 23:39.176
And they're probably onto
my cousin and her pals.

23:39.178 --> 23:42.880
So that's it. Any ideas?

23:42.882 --> 23:45.215
- Thoughts?
- Well, it crosses state lines.

23:45.217 --> 23:48.919
- Chip, you do federal.
- Okay.

23:48.921 --> 23:51.121
Your cousin doesn't
have a lot of choices.

23:51.123 --> 23:54.224
Yeah, but what I'm talking
about is pure profit.

23:54.226 --> 23:57.261
Yeah, but you have to have
inventory, distribution,

23:57.263 --> 23:58.929
all that pain in the ass stuff.

23:58.931 --> 24:01.064
- We just take our cut...
- You collect crumbs

24:01.066 --> 24:02.733
off the table.

24:02.735 --> 24:04.201
- You don't actually, you know...
- Sell something.

24:04.203 --> 24:07.738
- Yes. Sell something.
- Right? Something real.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.040
Something that a customer
can touch, right?

24:10.042 --> 24:12.843
That I can point at and say,
"Value. Good. Buy."

24:12.845 --> 24:14.445
And then you set the price.

24:14.447 --> 24:16.113
Sounds like an old-fashioned
way of making money to me.

24:16.115 --> 24:17.614
I think I'll stick to
playing the markets.

24:17.616 --> 24:19.783
- Rich is rich in my book.
- Well said.

24:19.785 --> 24:21.003
Hey!

24:22.021 --> 24:23.554
Hey, so sorry to interrupt.

24:23.556 --> 24:25.189
- Can I grab you for a second?
- Yeah, of course.

24:25.191 --> 24:27.024
Real quick, I want you to meet the gang.

24:27.026 --> 24:30.127
This is Kurt, Duke, Bobby.
Guys, this is my friend,

24:30.129 --> 24:32.896
- Jules Langmore.
- Nice to meet you.

24:32.898 --> 24:35.132
Julia Langmore.

24:35.134 --> 24:36.800
Jesus Christ.

24:36.802 --> 24:39.703
- We... we have to go.
- No, no, no.

24:39.705 --> 24:41.472
This should be good.

24:41.474 --> 24:44.308
So, you a big, famous artist yet?

24:44.310 --> 24:46.710
Stealing shit left and right?

24:46.712 --> 24:48.712
Wait, wait, wait.
This... this is that girl?

24:48.714 --> 24:50.647
This was your sister's roommate?

24:50.649 --> 24:53.250
Yeah. This is her.

24:53.252 --> 24:55.052
One classy bitch.

24:55.054 --> 24:56.753
Hey, easy, man.

24:56.755 --> 24:58.388
Why don't we all just
finish our drinks...

24:58.390 --> 25:00.824
- Is this your girlfriend?
- It's my friend, but...

25:00.826 --> 25:02.960
This is a bad person. A fraud.

25:02.962 --> 25:04.561
It's not true. It wasn't my fault.

25:04.563 --> 25:05.963
- It wasn't your fault?
- Hey, hands off, man.

25:05.965 --> 25:07.831
- Be a gentleman.
- Watch what you say to me,

25:07.833 --> 25:09.233
- you dick!
- I will pound your teeth

25:09.235 --> 25:10.901
into your goddamn throat.

25:10.903 --> 25:13.303
All right, all right.
Richard, let him up now.

25:15.741 --> 25:17.608
You should be ashamed of who you are!

25:17.610 --> 25:19.444
All right, man.

25:20.579 --> 25:22.779
Jules? Hey.

25:25.484 --> 25:28.752
Sorry. Hey, what the hell
happened in there?

25:28.754 --> 25:30.621
Nothing. Sorry I messed up
heaven for you.

25:30.623 --> 25:32.856
That's not what I meant. What happened?

25:32.858 --> 25:35.058
No. We are not talking about it.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.469
Honey, you look very handsome
in your denim and leather apron.

25:46.698 --> 25:50.364
I just hope the neighbors
don't have their binoculars out.

25:50.476 --> 25:52.042
I don't know how this is gonna go.

25:52.044 --> 25:53.443
- Sweetie.
- I didn't have

25:53.445 --> 25:55.612
such a good time downstairs
and it was just...

25:55.614 --> 25:58.815
Ours went fine,
and it's gonna be fine, I promise.

25:58.817 --> 26:02.019
If you can keep your temper in check.

26:02.021 --> 26:04.388
- I'll keep my temper in check.
- You will?

26:04.390 --> 26:06.056
- Yes, I promise.
- Okay.

26:06.058 --> 26:07.457
- Thank you.
- Can I get a kiss?

26:07.459 --> 26:10.394
Please do.

26:10.396 --> 26:11.828
It's great to have them both here.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.501
Wait, let me guess. So Josh and Ezra

26:17.503 --> 26:19.002
both needed five stitches each

26:19.004 --> 26:21.338
- and they owed you $20?
- And they never paid!

26:21.340 --> 26:22.706
- I didn't have any money!
- Pretty sure I paid.

26:22.708 --> 26:23.822
I paid.

26:24.476 --> 26:25.976
- Arthur, Arthur, honey.
- Josh got locked

26:25.978 --> 26:27.010
- in the basement.
- No.

26:27.012 --> 26:28.312
Put them out of their misery.

26:28.314 --> 26:31.315
Just give us the news. Okay?

26:31.317 --> 26:32.849
Okay, I suppose it's time.

26:35.888 --> 26:36.763
Um...

26:36.798 --> 26:37.854
- Very serious.
- Official.

26:37.856 --> 26:40.357
I've gathered you all together
here because, as you know,

26:40.359 --> 26:41.825
I have a big announcement to make.

26:41.827 --> 26:43.093
Wait, an announcement?

26:43.095 --> 26:44.528
You never mentioned that to us.

26:44.530 --> 26:46.330
- With...
- God. The Three Stooges.

26:46.332 --> 26:49.032
Everything that's been going
on in our family lately,

26:49.034 --> 26:51.234
um, combined with my attack,

26:51.236 --> 26:54.949
I've been thinking a
lot about priorities.

26:55.894 --> 27:00.063
You know, you just spend all day
thinking about the next thing.

27:00.065 --> 27:02.999
The one you think is gonna
be bigger or brighter.

27:03.001 --> 27:05.568
And you can lose sight of what you have.

27:05.570 --> 27:07.237
How valuable it is.

27:07.239 --> 27:09.205
How it could all go away.

27:09.207 --> 27:12.175
And life, as they say,
is for the living.

27:12.177 --> 27:14.945
So, for years,
your mother and I have been

27:14.947 --> 27:16.880
talking about taking a trip.

27:16.882 --> 27:19.115
- A second honeymoon.
- You have?

27:19.117 --> 27:21.751
To whom, exactly,
have you spoken about this?

27:21.753 --> 27:23.453
Well, you don't know
everything about us,

27:23.455 --> 27:24.754
- then, do you?
- Apparently not.

27:24.756 --> 27:26.748
So now, now...

27:27.426 --> 27:29.392
God damn it, we're gonna do it.

27:29.394 --> 27:31.761
We're taking six months
and we're just going.

27:31.763 --> 27:33.897
- Six months?
- Yes, if you're gonna charter

27:33.899 --> 27:35.966
a boat in the Mediterranean,
you may as well

27:35.968 --> 27:38.301
make it worth your while.

27:38.303 --> 27:39.903
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

27:39.905 --> 27:41.071
Wow. I'm so happy you guys are going.

27:41.073 --> 27:42.595
- You so deserve it.
- Wait.

27:42.596 --> 27:43.583
What's gonna happen with the company

27:43.584 --> 27:45.753
- while you're gone?
- Well, he's getting to that.

27:46.261 --> 27:48.959
- Slowly.
- You boys are smart.

27:48.960 --> 27:49.960
You have integrity.

27:51.339 --> 27:53.101
You treat people well.

27:54.450 --> 27:59.691
You've grown into men
that I'm proud to call my sons.

27:59.872 --> 28:01.938
You're not actually dying, are you, Dad?

28:01.940 --> 28:04.341
- That's very funny, Josh.
- You wanna know who's dying?

28:04.343 --> 28:07.043
I'm dying! Come on, get with it!

28:07.045 --> 28:10.847
Your mother and I have
decided that we would like

28:10.849 --> 28:14.050
the two of you... with Gaby's help...

28:14.052 --> 28:17.420
to start taking over
the family business.

28:17.422 --> 28:19.422
What?

28:19.424 --> 28:21.124
We thought you were never gonna leave.

28:21.126 --> 28:24.027
Yeah, mostly because you said,
"I will never leave.

28:24.029 --> 28:25.762
They can wheel me out."

28:25.764 --> 28:28.365
I had a change of heart.

28:28.367 --> 28:30.066
It happens.

28:30.068 --> 28:35.872
Sometimes the life you want
is right in front of you.

28:35.874 --> 28:39.142
You just have to see it.

28:39.144 --> 28:41.077
And take it.

28:50.088 --> 28:52.923
Am I weird for wanting to
stay in with you all the time

28:52.925 --> 28:56.259
rather than going to some fancy,
shmancy place?

28:56.261 --> 29:00.096
No. No, I don't think you're weird.

29:00.098 --> 29:01.533
Really?

29:02.835 --> 29:04.437
How about now?

29:05.604 --> 29:06.876
No.

29:07.606 --> 29:08.939
- No?
- No.

29:11.677 --> 29:13.944
- Now?
- No, that's not weird.

29:13.946 --> 29:16.179
I-I do that all the time.

29:16.181 --> 29:19.649
- Now?
- Disgusting, but not weird.

29:20.986 --> 29:22.752
But you know what?
Now that you mention it...

29:22.754 --> 29:25.589
- What?
- There is something strange.

29:25.591 --> 29:27.257
I knew it. It's my big toe, isn't it?

29:27.259 --> 29:30.093
- No... well, yeah.
- Hey!

29:30.095 --> 29:32.362
- What is it?
- It's your hands.

29:32.364 --> 29:34.798
- My hands are not weird!
- Yeah, no, they are.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.299
- Here, look.
- No!

29:36.301 --> 29:38.702
Come here, let me see.

29:38.704 --> 29:40.437
- What?
- Look.

29:40.439 --> 29:44.507
See, now... your hands look perfect.

29:45.731 --> 29:48.378
My God.

29:48.380 --> 29:51.114
It's a saffron.

29:51.116 --> 29:54.517
I've never seen one before.

29:54.519 --> 29:56.052
They're crazy rare, right?

29:59.024 --> 30:00.457
Crazy rare.

30:03.228 --> 30:06.863
You are the most incredible,

30:06.865 --> 30:09.799
fascinating woman I've ever met.

30:09.801 --> 30:15.338
And I know a life with
you would be beautiful.

30:15.340 --> 30:18.742
And I know that we would
laugh every single day.

30:18.744 --> 30:23.613
Saffron Keyes, will you marry me?

30:28.013 --> 30:29.452
No.

30:32.341 --> 30:34.575
- No?
- No.

30:34.577 --> 30:36.744
I have a counter proposal.

30:36.746 --> 30:39.247
You do?

30:39.249 --> 30:41.382
Let's run away together.

30:41.384 --> 30:43.051
You and me. Tonight.

30:43.053 --> 30:45.119
You don't have any obligations.

30:45.121 --> 30:47.121
I don't have any that I care about.

30:47.123 --> 30:50.458
Yeah, but I mean, how...
how would that even work?

30:50.460 --> 30:53.528
We just take the jet and disappear?

30:53.530 --> 30:55.530
- Yeah.
- Start new lives?

30:55.532 --> 30:58.466
Yeah. Patrick, I love you.
Do you love me?

30:58.468 --> 31:01.469
- I do. I love you.
- Okay.

31:01.471 --> 31:03.905
Let's just go, now. Tonight.

31:03.907 --> 31:07.575
We don't have to live
by anyone else's rules.

31:07.577 --> 31:11.479
I mean, isn't that what
you've been searching for?

31:27.964 --> 31:30.898
I can't do that.

31:30.900 --> 31:34.669
I don't... I don't know if it's
my mother's voice in my head

31:34.671 --> 31:37.972
or all the Sundays I spent in church,

31:37.974 --> 31:39.407
but I need...

31:43.246 --> 31:46.013
I guess I'm just traditional.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.421
I guess I'm just not.

32:08.805 --> 32:13.374
If you add it all up, Maddie
could get 30-40 years in prison.

32:13.376 --> 32:15.009
What about us?

32:15.011 --> 32:17.178
They say we'll maybe do five.

32:17.180 --> 32:18.780
- Five years?
- Years.

32:18.782 --> 32:21.048
- My God.
- Yeah.

32:21.050 --> 32:22.590
But there is one more thing.

32:22.591 --> 32:25.520
If we're willing to work with the FBI

32:25.522 --> 32:27.688
to bring Maddie to justice...

32:27.690 --> 32:29.690
We could make a deal.

32:29.692 --> 32:32.493
- Okay.
- Do probation,

32:32.495 --> 32:33.661
not serve any time.

32:33.663 --> 32:35.863
Could you do that?

32:35.865 --> 32:39.200
Put the woman that you love behind bars?

32:39.202 --> 32:44.205
Well, I'd know
where she is all the time.

32:44.207 --> 32:48.843
I could visit her. Bring her magazines.

32:48.845 --> 32:50.711
Maybe she'd finally
do crosswords with me.

32:50.713 --> 32:52.980
She never would before.

32:52.982 --> 32:54.549
And then maybe we could finally...

32:56.486 --> 32:58.049
Yeah, stupid idea.

32:59.355 --> 33:04.425
Hey, um, thanks for having
my back there at the club.

33:06.529 --> 33:08.996
Yeah, the code's the code, right?

33:08.998 --> 33:11.616
Pretty sure that's not in the code.

33:13.002 --> 33:15.570
Well, you're welcome, then.

33:19.275 --> 33:21.342
That stuff they were talking about,

33:21.344 --> 33:23.444
that's what was in your envelope?

33:23.446 --> 33:24.812
In the freezer?

33:34.290 --> 33:36.732
My mom was just so sick.

33:38.361 --> 33:42.530
And, you know,
I didn't know what to do.

33:42.532 --> 33:44.031
This guy comes to me,

33:44.033 --> 33:49.537
talking about shaving
some points and money.

33:53.109 --> 33:54.809
- I don't know.
- Hey.

33:57.113 --> 33:59.146
We do what we have to do.

34:01.951 --> 34:04.418
- You wanna talk about...
- My envelope stays sealed.

34:07.574 --> 34:09.223
So what do we do now?

34:09.225 --> 34:10.757
We gotta call Ezra.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.393
What if our phones are tapped?

34:15.440 --> 34:16.831
We'll text him.

34:16.833 --> 34:19.600
Pretty sure they can track that, too.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.469
We'll text him in code.

34:21.471 --> 34:23.304
- Come on.
- Okay.

34:34.984 --> 34:37.418
Yo, I was thinking, because I'm older,

34:37.420 --> 34:40.187
I should have Dad's office
and you should have Mom's.

34:40.188 --> 34:44.257
You do know Mom's a year older than Dad.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.360
Right, right.

34:46.362 --> 34:49.630
No problem. It's all yours.

34:49.632 --> 34:52.466
For reals?

34:52.467 --> 34:55.803
Shit, man. You're gonna back out.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.705
They just offered us
the fricking company.

34:57.707 --> 35:00.675
Look, I thought you wanted to
go to Denmark and be like Dink.

35:00.677 --> 35:02.343
I can be Dink right here.

35:02.345 --> 35:04.679
This is like my Dink moment.

35:04.681 --> 35:06.847
And you?

35:06.849 --> 35:08.849
You know...

35:08.851 --> 35:11.118
we would be like...

35:11.120 --> 35:13.354
I just... I don't know if I can do it.

35:13.356 --> 35:15.489
Okay. But you're not saying no.

35:15.491 --> 35:17.158
No, just think about it.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.628
Do not let this go.
'Cause we would kill it, man.

35:20.630 --> 35:23.264
As brothers. You know?

35:24.667 --> 35:26.167
Hey, Ezra the human, you wanna go walk.

35:26.169 --> 35:28.836
- Ezra the dog with me?
- Sure.

35:28.838 --> 35:32.306
- And around they go again.
- Shut up, Josh.

35:34.744 --> 35:36.410
So then he walks in the exam room

35:36.412 --> 35:40.381
and he's like, "Hi, I'm Dr. Sheffield,
the vetinarian." And I'm like,

35:40.383 --> 35:42.483
- "You mean the veterinarian?"
- Yeah.

35:42.485 --> 35:44.218
And he looks at me like
I'm pronouncing it wrong.

35:44.220 --> 35:45.553
- That's nuts.
- No, it gets crazier.

35:45.555 --> 35:47.822
Later that day, I went to return a book

35:47.824 --> 35:49.290
and there was this woman
that I didn't recognize

35:49.292 --> 35:50.658
sitting at the desk and she's like,

35:50.660 --> 35:53.394
"Hi, I'm Mrs. Jones, the new libarian."

35:53.396 --> 35:55.029
- No!
- Like, you have to be able

35:55.031 --> 35:56.593
to pronounce your own job.

35:56.666 --> 35:57.898
- It should be a requirement.
- Yeah.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.600
- At the very least.
- Sorry.

35:59.602 --> 36:01.435
My friends think they're
being funny or something.

36:01.437 --> 36:02.770
Do you have new friends?

36:02.772 --> 36:04.605
- Yeah.
- Wow.

36:04.607 --> 36:07.241
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's just so fancy.

36:09.412 --> 36:12.179
It's pretty crazy
about your mom and dad?

36:12.181 --> 36:13.614
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:13.616 --> 36:16.450
Um, you know,
Josh wants to do it and I think

36:16.452 --> 36:18.786
it could be really good.

36:18.788 --> 36:22.523
- It's just, um...
- What?

36:22.525 --> 36:24.892
Part of me thinks I need
to finish what I started

36:24.894 --> 36:27.595
with my so-called ex-wife.

36:27.597 --> 36:29.599
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

36:31.401 --> 36:34.068
Sorry. I don't know
what they're playing at.

36:34.070 --> 36:37.471
You know what? What your dad
said is pretty spot on, Ezra.

36:37.473 --> 36:38.939
I hope it doesn't take you 30 years

36:38.941 --> 36:40.541
of whatever you're doing to realize

36:40.543 --> 36:42.910
what you have standing
right in front of you.

36:45.248 --> 36:48.449
Maybe.

36:48.451 --> 36:49.650
Maybe it won't.

36:51.387 --> 36:53.587
- Actually, my ride's here.
- Yeah?

36:53.589 --> 36:55.790
I see you've made

36:55.792 --> 36:58.325
new friends, too.

36:58.327 --> 37:01.429
To be determined.

37:01.431 --> 37:04.365
Maybe I'll see you at the office.

37:26.665 --> 37:28.198
Got a 1:00 tee time. You in?

37:28.200 --> 37:31.034
Ooh, isn't that a pretty long lunch?

37:31.036 --> 37:32.936
Wait. We're the boss.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.040
<i>Check your top drawer.</i>

37:40.011 --> 37:42.345
<i>It's blueberry peach.</i>

37:42.347 --> 37:44.781
<i>- Who's better than you?
- No one.</i>

38:03.668 --> 38:04.901
Ezra, no!

38:19.718 --> 38:20.750
<i>- Hello?
- Bro!</i>

38:20.752 --> 38:22.252
Why have you not texted us back?

38:22.254 --> 38:24.921
You were, like, butt-emojing me.

38:24.923 --> 38:26.990
It wasn't butt emoji, it was code!

38:26.992 --> 38:29.959
Frog, bikini, Eiffel Tower is FBI.

38:29.961 --> 38:31.694
Eiffel Tower is spelled with an E.

38:31.696 --> 38:33.496
What? Eiffel Tower?
That's not the point, man.

38:33.498 --> 38:36.733
- The point is that...
- Ez, this is serious.

38:36.735 --> 38:38.568
Patrick is in the FBI.

38:38.570 --> 38:40.203
Wait. What?

38:40.205 --> 38:41.738
<i>The Feds are trying to take Maddie down.</i>

38:41.740 --> 38:43.406
They could come after us, too. Okay.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.675
Look, man. We need you back, like, now.

38:45.677 --> 38:47.043
<i>- Just come now.
- All right.</i>

38:47.045 --> 38:49.279
All right, calm down.

38:49.281 --> 38:53.516
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:53.518 --> 38:55.051
Okay?

39:11.703 --> 39:13.303
- Airport, please.
- You got it.

39:20.812 --> 39:24.047
Granola bar?

39:24.049 --> 39:27.050
Je suis desole, madame.
Je ne parle pas Anglais.

39:27.052 --> 39:29.419
I'm sorry.
