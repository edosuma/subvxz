YOU AIN'T.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.094
SHE WAS JUST
INVENTED LAST YEAR.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.555
YOU HOLLER INTO HER, AND
SHE HOLLERS RIGHT BACK.

12:42.721 --> 12:45.808
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:45.975 --> 12:48.978
I--I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD
TIME SPENDING THIS AT THE STORE.

12:49.145 --> 12:51.730
YOU KNOW, I OWE $2.85
JUST FOR MATERIALS.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.732
EVENING, CHARLES,
MR. GODFREY.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.068
WELL, I SEE YOU'VE STILL
GOT THE TALKING MACHINE.

12:56.235 --> 12:59.697
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY WIFE,
AND I THINK WE CAN USE ONE.

12:59.864 --> 13:03.576
WELL, INGALLS AND I ARE JUST PULLING
AND TUGGING ON THAT VERY SUBJECT.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.162
I WASN'T TUGGING VERY HARD, NELS.
YOU WANT TO BUY IT?

13:06.996 --> 13:08.581
WELL,
NELLIE WANTS IT.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.541
MAYBE WE CAN WORK
SOME KIND OF DEAL.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.251
WHAT DO I OWE YOU
AT THE STORE?

13:12.418 --> 13:15.337
ABOUT $7.00, NEAR AS
I CAN REMEMBER.

13:15.504 --> 13:16.505
WELL, $7.00 WILL DO IT.

13:16.672 --> 13:17.923
YOU MARK THAT BILL
"PAID IN FULL,"

13:18.090 --> 13:19.717
AND YOU'VE BOUGHT YOURSELF
A TALKING MACHINE.

13:21.886 --> 13:22.887
A DEAL?

13:23.053 --> 13:24.763
Nels: DEAL.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.308
Jason: THIS IS
A DONKEY ENGINE...

13:27.475 --> 13:30.769
[ENGINE WHISTLING]

13:32.021 --> 13:33.230
AND THIS IS THE BOILER.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.441
WHEN THE WATER GETS TO
BOILING, IT MAKES STEAM,

13:35.608 --> 13:37.526
AND THE STEAM GOES
THROUGH THIS THING HERE

13:37.693 --> 13:39.320
INTO THE CYLINDER PART
AND THE CYLINDER,

13:39.487 --> 13:42.364
AND IT MAKES THE PISTON MOVE,
AND THAT MAKES THE FLYWHEEL GO,

13:42.531 --> 13:43.616
AND THAT'S IT.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.368
[APPLAUSE]

13:49.997 --> 13:51.332
SOMEDAY
WE'LL HAVE WAGONS

13:51.499 --> 13:53.626
WITH STEAM ENGINES TO DRIVE
THEM INSTEAD OF HORSES.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.127
WE WILL NOT.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.295
Jason: YES, WE WILL,

13:56.462 --> 13:58.255
AND MAYBE EVEN
STEAM FLYING MACHINES.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.341
THAT'S SILLY.

14:00.508 --> 14:01.800
THAT'S NOT SO SILLY.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.719
A BRILLIANT MAN
NAMED LEONARDO DA VINCI

14:03.886 --> 14:06.305
PREDICTED THAT
MANY YEARS AGO.

14:06.472 --> 14:09.517
NOW, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
FROM THIS DEMONSTRATION?

14:09.683 --> 14:10.935
YES, WILLIE?

14:11.101 --> 14:14.688
THAT THERE'S A MAN NAMED
LEONARDO DA-SOMETHING

14:14.855 --> 14:16.899
THAT'S AS SILLY
AS JASON.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.275
[CHILDREN LAUGH]

14:18.442 --> 14:19.985
STAND IN THE CORNER,
WILLIE.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.820
YES, MA'AM.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.697
[THUNDER]

14:30.955 --> 14:32.831
[THUNDER]

14:32.998 --> 14:35.834
MISS BEADLE, MAY I BE EXCUSED?
SHE'S COMING UP REAL GOOD.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.670
VERY WELL, JASON,
BUT WE'LL EXPECT

14:37.836 --> 14:39.755
A REPORT ON YOUR
EXPERIMENT TOMORROW.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.215
Jason: YES, MA'AM.

14:41.382 --> 14:42.466
LAURA!

14:43.509 --> 14:44.843
I'M HELPING HIM,
MISS BEADLE.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.929
THAT'S RIGHT,
MISS BEADLE.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.640
OH, VERY WELL.
YOU MAY GO.

14:49.807 --> 14:50.975
THANKS!

14:52.643 --> 14:54.270
NELLIE, WAIT A MINUTE!

14:56.313 --> 14:57.856
JASON!

14:58.023 --> 15:00.317
I'VE GOT
A TALKING MACHINE!

15:00.484 --> 15:02.111
JASON!

15:02.278 --> 15:04.613
[THUNDER]

15:11.161 --> 15:12.246
GET THE UMBRELLA.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.415
WHAT FOR?
WE'RE ALREADY WET.

15:14.582 --> 15:18.085
IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT--
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.214
HERE, LET ME.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.382
HANG ON TIGHT.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.342
DON'T WORRY. I WILL.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.720
YOU CAN TRUST ME,
JASON.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.601
WHY DO WE NEED
THE UMBRELLA?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.311
SO WE CAN KEEP
THE RIBBON DRY.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.771
WELL, WHAT'S THE USE OF
KEEPING THE RIBBON DRY

15:37.938 --> 15:38.939
IF THE STRING'S
ALL WET?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.899
BECAUSE BEN FRANKLIN
SAID SO.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.153
BOY, WE GOT A GULLYWHOPPER.
LOOK, LAURA.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.576
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

15:50.743 --> 15:52.745
WE KEEP HER DRY
AND WAIT.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.080
YOU SAW THAT LITTLE WIRE
POINTY THING ON THE FRONT.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.999
THE ONE THAT WAS STICKING
STRAIGHT UP? YEAH.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.793
WELL, THAT SCRATCHES THE CLOUD
AND LETS THE ELECTRIC FIRE OUT,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.128
AND IT RUNS
DOWN THE STRING.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.757
ELECTRIC FIRE? I DON'T
THINK I LIKE THAT.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.258
IT WON'T HURT YOU.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.926
THE WAY THAT KITE'S
BUCKING AND BOUNCING,

16:08.093 --> 16:09.637
IT SHOULDN'T BE LONG.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.847
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

16:12.848 --> 16:13.932
THE KEY.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.856
OW!

16:21.899 --> 16:24.109
WE DID IT! WE DID IT!

16:24.276 --> 16:25.569
WHAT DID WE DO?

16:25.736 --> 16:27.279
JUST LIKE
BEN FRANKLIN SAID!

16:27.446 --> 16:28.280
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS?

16:28.447 --> 16:31.116
REAL, GENUINE,
100% ELECTRICITY!

16:31.283 --> 16:34.870
SURE FELT LIKE
100% SOMETHING.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.705
I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

16:36.872 --> 16:37.790
HOORAY, WE DID IT!

16:37.956 --> 16:40.459
HOORAY FOR US!
HOORAY FOR BEN FRANKLIN!

16:40.626 --> 16:41.752
HOORAY FOR US!

16:41.919 --> 16:43.212
WE DID IT!
WE DID IT, LAURA!

16:43.379 --> 16:45.714
WE MADE ELECTRICITY! HOORAY
FOR US, LAURA! HOORAY!

16:45.881 --> 16:47.466
WE MADE
ELECTRICITY!

16:47.633 --> 16:48.467
WE FINALLY DID IT!

16:48.634 --> 16:50.344
WE MADE ELECTRICITY!
HOORAY!

16:50.511 --> 16:51.470
HOORAY! HOORAY FOR US!

16:51.637 --> 16:54.181
WE MADE ELECTRICITY!
HOORAY FOR US!

16:54.348 --> 16:57.643
HOORAY! WE DID IT! HOORAY!
WE DID IT! HOORAY!

17:02.981 --> 17:04.775
[THUNDER]

17:09.822 --> 17:11.323
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP THERE?

17:11.490 --> 17:13.158
Mary: WHICH ONE
Do YOU WANT?

17:13.325 --> 17:15.828
THE GREEN ONE--AND HURRY.
SHE'S SHIVERING.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.996
Charles: HERE.
I'LL GET HER JACKET.

17:18.163 --> 17:18.956
OH.

17:19.123 --> 17:20.040
IT'S COMING DOWN.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.208
OH, THANK YOU.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.626
HA HA HA HA!

17:22.793 --> 17:24.336
OH, I THINK YOU AND YOUR
FRIEND JASON COULD THINK OF

17:24.503 --> 17:27.965
SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO
GO KITE FLYING IN THE RAIN.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.341
OH, YOU'RE SOAKED
TO THE SKIN.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.343
AND THESE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO COME OFF, TOO.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.430
IT WAS A SCIENTIFIC
EXPERIMENT, MA.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.682
- MMM.
- IT WAS FUN, PA.

17:36.849 --> 17:40.352
Charles: WELL, IT MUST HAVE BEEN To
GET YOU SOAKED To THE SKIN LIKE THAT.

17:40.519 --> 17:41.520
DID YOU BRING
PANTALOONS?

17:41.687 --> 17:43.480
- THESE ARE MINE.
- THEY'RE DROOPY!

17:43.647 --> 17:45.023
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE GOING ANYWHERE.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.859
SO YOU TWO INVENTED
ELECTRICITY, HUH?

17:47.025 --> 17:50.362
YES, SIR. ACTUALLY, BEN
FRANKLIN DID IT FIRST,

17:50.529 --> 17:52.030
BUT WE DID IT
JUST AS GOOD.

17:52.197 --> 17:55.325
JASON SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT MY HELP.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.869
MAYBE I'LL BE
A LADY SCIENTIST.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.454
NOW YOU WON'T BE ANYTHING
IF YOU CATCH YOUR DEATH.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.206
COME ON. LET'S GET
YOU OVER TO THE FIRE.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.377
Laura: DON'T WORRY, MA.
I FEEL WONDERFUL,

18:05.544 --> 18:07.337
REALLY WONDERFUL.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.384
AH-CHOO!

18:12.551 --> 18:14.470
BLESS YOU.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.117
[SNIFFLING]

18:43.040 --> 18:45.375
MA SAYS SHE MIGHT HAVE TO
KEEP YOU HOME TOMORROW.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.585
I'M NOT SICK.

18:46.752 --> 18:48.420
I TOLD HER YOU JUST
GOT THE SNIFFLES.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.964
INFLAMMATION
OF THE NASAL MEMBRANES.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.424
HUH?

18:52.591 --> 18:54.426
FROM A GERM
IT SAYS HERE.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.345
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

18:56.512 --> 19:00.098
IT'S LONG AND GREEN

19:00.265 --> 19:03.227
MOST LIKELY WITH SPOTS
DOWN ITS BACK

19:03.393 --> 19:05.020
AND A PASSEL OF LEGS.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.606
YOU'RE MAKING IT AWFUL
FANCY SEEMS LIKE.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.067
WHEN YOU'RE SILLY ENOUGH
TO GO KITE FLYING IN THE RAIN,

19:10.234 --> 19:11.527
YOU GET YOUR FEET WET,

19:11.693 --> 19:13.862
AND WHEN YOU GET YOUR FEET
WET, YOU GET THE SNIFFLES.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.155
THAT'S ALL THERE IS
ABOUT IT.

19:15.322 --> 19:19.910
THAT'S WHEN A GERM
GETS YOU IT SAYS.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.538
MAYBE JASON
GOT IT, TOO.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.626
MAYBE WE BOTH HAVE
THE SAME GERM.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.797
HOW ROMANTIC.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.298
PLEASE DON'T MAKE
FUN OF ME.

19:33.465 --> 19:35.634
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

19:35.801 --> 19:36.969
BETTER GET TO SLEEP.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.304
TURN OUT THE LAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.306
GOOD NIGHT.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.599
AH-CHOO!

19:51.525 --> 19:54.194
NELLIE, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO, HONEY?

19:54.361 --> 19:56.071
JUST WORKING
ON MY SAMPLER, MA.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.157
OH. YOU BETTER COME INSIDE, HONEY.
IT'S GETTING CHILLY.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.576
AW, MA!

20:00.742 --> 20:02.244
OH, WELL. NOW COME ON. THE
SNIFFLES ARE GOING AROUND,

20:02.411 --> 20:03.954
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET THEM.
COME ON. COME ON.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.832
I'M NOT COLD. LET ME BE.

20:06.999 --> 20:08.083
OH!

20:09.960 --> 20:11.503
Jason: THEY'VE HAD THEM
FOR A LONG TIME.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.423
ALMOST 100 YEARS AGO, THEY HAD A
BALLOON IN FRANCE THAT WENT UP

20:14.590 --> 20:16.508
CARRYING A ROOSTER
AND A SHEEP AND A DUCK.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.552
THEN THEY BUILT
A BIGGER ONE

20:18.719 --> 20:20.220
THAT CARRIED TWO MEN
UP IN THE SKY.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.973
Laura: WHAT
MAKES IT Go UP?

20:23.140 --> 20:26.435
YOU SEE, HOT AIR RISES, SO WHEN YOU
LIGHT THE FLAME UNDER THE BALLOON,

20:26.602 --> 20:27.477
IT LIFTS IT
OFF THE GROUND.

20:27.644 --> 20:28.520
WITH PEOPLE IN IT?

20:28.687 --> 20:30.022
SURE.

20:30.188 --> 20:33.692
I'D BE AFRAID. BUT YOU
WOULDN'T, WOULD YOU, JASON?

20:33.859 --> 20:36.069
OF COURSE NOT. SCIENTISTS
HAVE TO BE BRAVE.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.362
Nellie's voice:
HEY, JASON.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.531
AREN'T YOU GOING TO
SAY HELLO TO ME?

20:39.698 --> 20:42.075
I'M A TALKING MACHINE,

20:42.242 --> 20:44.912
INVENTED BY
THOMAS EDISON HIMSELF.

20:45.078 --> 20:48.749
I CAN SING AND WHISTLE
AND TELL JOKES.

20:48.916 --> 20:52.085
I CAN REPEAT
ANYTHING ANYBODY TELLS ME

20:52.252 --> 20:53.712
AND NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.381
IF YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME,

20:56.548 --> 21:00.093
I CAN TALK RIGHT BACK TO YOU
AND NEVER CHANGE A WORD.

21:00.260 --> 21:05.182
I'M THE LATEST,
GREATEST, NEWEST,

21:05.349 --> 21:10.979
TRUEST, ONLIEST TALKING MACHINE
IN THE UNITED STATES

21:11.146 --> 21:13.190
WEST OF MENLO PARK,
NEW JERSEY.

21:13.357 --> 21:17.194
I CAN TALK, AND I CAN SING,
AND I CAN DO ANY--

21:17.361 --> 21:18.612
GOODNESS SAKES, NELLIE.
WHAT DO YOU GOT HERE?

21:18.779 --> 21:20.447
WHY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE INTERESTED.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.991
I TOLD YOU I HAD
A TALKING MACHINE,

21:23.158 --> 21:25.494
AND YOU DIDN'T PAY
ANY MIND TO ME.

21:25.661 --> 21:28.914
I'M SORRY, NELLIE.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.583
NELLIE, PLEASE, CAN I
HAVE A LOOK AT HER?

21:31.750 --> 21:35.212
WELL...IF YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE INTERESTED.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.012
A TALKING MACHINE.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.473
A GENUINE
TALKING MACHINE.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.350
CAN I TRY IT?

21:48.517 --> 21:53.605
WELL, ALL RIGHT, BUT WE'D BETTER
TAKE IT INSIDE-- AND JUST JASON.

21:53.772 --> 21:57.818
MY MOTHER DOESN'T LIKE A LOT OF
CHILDREN AROUND HER GOOD CHINA.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.446
COME ON, JASON.
YOU CAN CARRY IT.

22:01.613 --> 22:04.741
A GENUINE
TALKING MACHINE!

22:26.138 --> 22:28.223
THAT EXPLAINS WHY
NELS WAS SO INTERESTED

22:28.390 --> 22:29.391
IN THAT TALKING MACHINE.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.852
WISH YOU HAD
GOTTEN IT, PA.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.645
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
HALF-PINT,

22:33.812 --> 22:34.980
BUT WE NEEDED TO PAY
OUR BILLS AT THE STORE

22:35.147 --> 22:37.107
A LOT MORE THAN WE
NEEDED THAT MACHINE.

22:37.274 --> 22:41.903
NELLIE SURE IS LUCKY. SHE CAN
HAVE ANYTHING SHE WANTS.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.699
WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS?

22:45.866 --> 22:47.159
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:47.325 --> 22:50.203
WELL, YOU SAID NELLIE COULD
HAVE ANYTHING SHE WANTS.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.372
WHAT YOU MEAN IS
ANYTHING SHE CAN BUY.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.208
YOU CAN BUY FRIENDS,
TOO, BUT NOT REAL ONES.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.503
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THE WHOLE
WIDE WORLD TO BUY A REAL FRIEND...

22:58.670 --> 23:00.672
OR A BOYFRIEND EITHER.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.009
THEN WHY DID HE
GO OFF WITH HER?

23:04.176 --> 23:06.178
'CAUSE HE WAS INTERESTED
IN THE MACHINE.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.055
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF YOU
KNEW A BOY ONLY LIKED YOU

23:08.221 --> 23:10.348
'CAUSE YOU HAD SOMETHING
LIKE A TALKING MACHINE?

23:10.515 --> 23:12.267
NOT SO GOOD, I GUESS.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.643
OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.562
IF HE LIKED YOU BEFORE,
HE'LL LIKE YOU NOW.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.356
NO TALKING MACHINE IN THE
WORLD'S GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.150
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:20.317 --> 23:23.487
WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID OF A
DUMB OLD TALKING MACHINE?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.197
THERE YOU GO. WHY DON'T
YOU GO ON IN THE HOUSE?

23:25.363 --> 23:26.698
TELL YOUR MA I'LL BE IN
IN A MINUTE.

23:26.865 --> 23:27.991
YES, SIR.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.453
PA?

23:31.620 --> 23:32.537
MM-HMM?

23:32.704 --> 23:34.039
IF MA SAYS
IT'S ALL RIGHT,

23:34.206 --> 23:36.333
CAN I INVITE JASON
TO SUPPER TOMORROW NIGHT?

23:37.918 --> 23:39.878
IF YOUR MA SAYS ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

23:40.045 --> 23:43.965
THANKS. IF I'M NOT GOING TO BE
AFRAID OF NELLIE'S TALKING MACHINE,

23:44.132 --> 23:47.302
I DON'T SEE WHY SHE SHOULD
BE AFRAID OF MA'S DUMPLINGS.

24:04.236 --> 24:06.071
Jason: LOOK AT HER!
IT'S COMING RIGHT To YOU.

24:06.238 --> 24:09.574
IT'S PERFECT!
I'LL GET IT!

24:09.741 --> 24:10.700
JUST LOOK AT IT!

24:10.867 --> 24:12.285
IT'S PERFECT.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.792
I GOT IT.

24:22.796 --> 24:25.423
IT WORKED JUST LIKE
THE BIG STEAMSHIP.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.591
IT SURE DID.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.343
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
JASON?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.761
I BET THAT SOMEDAY
THEY'LL HAVE A STEAMSHIP

24:29.928 --> 24:31.304
THAT'LL FLY RIGHT
OUT OF THE WATER,

24:31.471 --> 24:34.266
AND IT CAN LAND
ANYWHERE IT WANTS TO.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.185
I GUESS IT'S KIND
OF SILLY, ISN'T IT?

24:37.352 --> 24:39.771
NO, IT'S NOT.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.108
YOU KNOW, LAURA,
THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.694
A STEAM ENGINE AIRPLANE
THAT LANDS ON WATER.

24:45.861 --> 24:47.320
THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA!

24:47.487 --> 24:49.781
CAN I BE YOUR PARTNER, JASON,
AND HELP YOU INVENT IT?

24:49.948 --> 24:51.908
SURE YOU CAN.

24:52.075 --> 24:56.454
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
FOR MY PARTNER BUT YOU.

24:56.621 --> 24:59.416
I BETTER BE GOING.
I'VE GOT SOME CHORES TO DO.

24:59.583 --> 25:02.210
DON'T FORGET ABOUT SUPPER.
WE'RE HAVING DUMPLINGS.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.588
I'LL BE THERE.

25:07.299 --> 25:09.509
HIS PARTNER.

25:14.014 --> 25:19.477
MM-HMM.
OH, THAT SMELLS GOOD.

25:19.644 --> 25:20.687
THERE YOU GO.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.063
THERE YOU
ARE, JASON.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.648
- THANK YOU, MA'AM.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.609
SO YOU FIGURED THAT WHOLE
THING OUT BY YOURSELF, HUH?

25:25.775 --> 25:28.445
YES, SIR. IT'S A MATTER OF
TRANSFERRING THE VIBRATIONS

25:28.612 --> 25:30.280
FROM THE SOUND
ONTO A HUNK OF TIN FOIL.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.991
IT MAKES LITTLE BUMPS, AND
WHEN YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO IT,

25:33.158 --> 25:35.952
YOU DO IT BACKWARDS, AND
EVERYTHING COMES OUT.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.329
ISN'T HE SMART?

25:37.495 --> 25:38.747
HE CERTAINLY IS.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.124
HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT SCIENCE
THAN MISS BEADLE DOES.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.292
DON'T YOU, JASON?

25:42.459 --> 25:43.376
AW, LAURA.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.045
LAURA, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING JASON.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.379
WELL, IT'S THE TRUTH,
THOUGH.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.798
I'M SORRY NOW
I DIDN'T KEEP THAT THING.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.842
WISH YOU HAD, PA.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.136
I RECITED "THE BOY STOOD
ON THE BURNING DECK"

25:53.303 --> 25:54.763
WITH A MOUTHFUL
OF GUMDROPS.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.056
[ALL LAUGH]

25:56.223 --> 25:57.474
NELLIE GAVE YOU GUMDROPS?

25:57.641 --> 25:59.726
SEVEN. MRS. OLESON
SANG GRAND OPERA.

25:59.893 --> 26:01.895
OH. SHE BREAK
THE PICKLE CROCK?

26:02.062 --> 26:04.105
- CHARLES.
- HA HA HA!

26:04.272 --> 26:06.441
THAT MACHINE IS
A SUREFIRE WONDER.

26:06.608 --> 26:09.194
SOMEDAY WE'LL HAVE MUSIC OR
POETRY OR ANYTHING WE WANT.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.112
JUST TURN THE CRANK,
AND THERE SHE IS.

26:11.279 --> 26:14.324
GOING TO HAVE A TALKING MACHINE
ON YOUR STEAM ENGINE AIRPLANE?

26:14.491 --> 26:15.951
MAYBE.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.579
I'M GOING TO HELP JASON INVENT THINGS.
AREN'T I, JASON?

26:19.746 --> 26:21.414
SURE.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.711
MIGHTY FINE
DUMPLINGS, MA'AM.

26:26.878 --> 26:28.213
THANK YOU.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.257
Laura: YOU KNOW,
THE DUMPLING'S FLOATING--

26:30.423 --> 26:32.342
IT DISPLACES ITS
WEIGHT IN GRAVITY.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.552
ARTIMEDE SAID SO.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.054
ARCHIMEDES.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.390
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
ARCHIMEDES.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.558
AND YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

26:46.189 --> 26:49.025
A LAMP WON'T BURN
WITHOUT OXYGEN.

26:54.030 --> 26:57.117
Charles: HUH. I TAKE IT THAT'S
THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT.

26:57.284 --> 26:58.410
YES, SIR.

26:58.576 --> 27:01.162
GOOD. WELL, I'LL JUST
FIND--OH, DADBURN IT!

27:01.329 --> 27:02.455
Caroline: WHAT'S
THE MATTER, CHARLES?

27:02.622 --> 27:04.499
I JUST DISPLACED
MY GRAVY WITH MY ELBOW.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.752
[LAUGHTER]

27:07.919 --> 27:10.922
Mrs. Oleson: A VERY STRANGE
YOUNG MAN, IF YOU ASK ME.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.091
Mr. Oleson: SEEMS
NICE ENOUGH To ME.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.259
I HATE HIM!

27:14.426 --> 27:16.052
OH, NELLIE, DEAR,
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

27:16.219 --> 27:17.637
I DO TOO.
I HATE HIM.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.764
HE'S A MEAN,
NASTY OLD BOY--

27:19.931 --> 27:21.808
HASN'T GOT A NOTION IN
HIS HEAD ABOUT MANNERS.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.768
IT'S A WONDER
HE WEARS SHOES.

27:23.935 --> 27:27.605
WELL, HE'S...HE'S FROM
MASSACHUSETTS, ISN'T HE?

27:27.772 --> 27:29.941
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

27:31.151 --> 27:33.445
WELL...

27:33.611 --> 27:36.531
IT'S GREAT SHOE COUNTRY
BACK THERE.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.786
CAN YOU IMAGINE
THAT LAURA INGALLS

27:41.953 --> 27:43.788
MARCHING IN HERE
AS BOLD AS BRASS,

27:43.955 --> 27:46.207
INVITING THAT BOY OUT
TO HER HOME FOR SUPPER

27:46.374 --> 27:48.752
RIGHT WHILE NELLIE'S
ENTERTAINING HIM.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.129
WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO
IF HE DIDN'T WANT TO.

27:51.296 --> 27:54.132
PA, YOU'RE AS MEAN
AS HE IS.

27:54.299 --> 27:56.259
NOW, SEE HERE, YOUNG LADY!
HOLD YOUR TONGUE!

27:56.426 --> 27:57.344
NELS OLESON!

27:57.510 --> 27:59.012
THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU, TOO!

27:59.179 --> 28:01.931
NOW, THIS THING HAS GONE ABOUT
AS FAR AS I WANT IT TO GO.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.809
SILLIEST THING IN THE WORLD, A YOUNG'UN
LIKE THAT FRETTING OVER A BOY.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.228
SHE ISN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BLOW
THE FOAM OFF A SARSAPARILLA!

28:07.395 --> 28:09.314
NOW IF HE WANTED TO GO
TO SUPPER AT THE INGALLS',

28:09.481 --> 28:11.649
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE HE
APPRECIATED THE INVITATION,

28:11.816 --> 28:12.859
OR MAYBE HE WAS JUST HUNGRY,

28:13.026 --> 28:14.361
OR MAYBE HE LIKES
THE INGALLS.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.904
THEY'RE
A VERY NICE FAMILY!

28:16.071 --> 28:18.907
[NELLIE BAWLS]

28:19.074 --> 28:21.993
NELS! I'M
SURPRISED AT YOU!

28:22.160 --> 28:23.995
SO AM I.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.331
PASS THE BISCUITS.

28:30.502 --> 28:33.088
[BAWLING]

28:38.885 --> 28:40.595
[STOPS BAWLING]

29:20.885 --> 29:22.554
GOOD MORNING,
MR. OLESON.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.639
WELL, LAURA,
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

29:24.806 --> 29:26.599
FINE, THANKS.
BROUGHT MA'S EGGS IN.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.561
SO I SEE. COME ON INSIDE.
WE'LL HAVE A LOOK.

29:35.066 --> 29:38.570
ONLY TWO DOZEN TODAY. MA SAYS
THE HENS ARE SLACKING OFF.

29:38.736 --> 29:41.239
WELL, I GUESS IT'S
THAT TIME OF YEAR.

29:41.406 --> 29:44.325
I'LL JUST PUT THAT
DOWN AS A CREDIT.

29:44.492 --> 29:45.577
YOU NEED ANYTHING?

29:45.743 --> 29:49.747
YES. SOME WHITE SUGAR
AND SOME CREAM OF TARTAR.

29:49.914 --> 29:53.626
YES, MA'AM. WHITE SUGAR,
CREAM OF TARTAR...

29:53.793 --> 29:55.920
AND ONE GUMBALL.

29:56.087 --> 29:58.339
THANKS, MR. OLESON.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.843
LET'S SEE. SUGAR...

30:04.762 --> 30:06.598
HI, LAURA!

30:06.764 --> 30:08.057
HI.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.726
HOW'S YOUR COLD?

30:09.893 --> 30:11.144
IT'S ALL BETTER.

30:11.311 --> 30:13.771
JUST A LITTLE INFLAMMATION
OF THE NASAL MEMBRANES.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.106
SOUNDS WORSE THAN IT IS.

30:15.273 --> 30:16.441
YOU HAVE
TO GO RIGHT HOME?

30:16.608 --> 30:18.276
NO, I DON'T. WHY?

30:18.443 --> 30:19.527
COME UP TO MY ROOM.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.404
WHAT FOR?

30:21.571 --> 30:22.780
JUST TALK.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.867
HAVE ANOTHER
GUMDROP.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.454
YOU FEEL OK, NELLIE?

30:29.621 --> 30:33.333
JUST FINE. GRAB A
HANDFUL AND COME ON.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.979
OH, NELLIE...

30:55.146 --> 30:58.233
YOU SURE HAVE
A PRETTY ROOM.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.401
YOU'VE SEEN IT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

31:00.568 --> 31:03.863
YEAH, BUT IT WAS SUCH A
LONG TIME AGO, I FORGOT.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.490
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE INVITED.

31:05.657 --> 31:07.325
WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE?

31:07.492 --> 31:08.660
WE ARE?

31:08.826 --> 31:11.579
OF COURSE WE ARE. COME
ON, LIE DOWN ON THE BED.

31:13.706 --> 31:17.502
I GOT A NEW DOLL, ALL THE
WAY FROM PARIS, FRANCE.

31:18.962 --> 31:21.756
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
NELLIE.

31:21.923 --> 31:25.009
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A DOLL LIKE IT.

31:25.176 --> 31:28.304
YOU'RE PRETTY FOND
OF JASON, AREN'T YOU?

31:28.471 --> 31:30.348
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

31:30.515 --> 31:32.350
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE BASHFUL.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.561
WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE?

31:34.727 --> 31:38.940
WELL, I THINK
HE'S NICE.

31:39.107 --> 31:41.568
HE SURE IS
AWFUL SMART.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.861
I DON'T KNOW
ANY OTHER BOY

31:44.028 --> 31:45.697
THAT COULD BE SUCH A HAND
AT EXPLAINING THINGS

31:45.863 --> 31:46.948
LIKE HE IS.

31:47.115 --> 31:49.284
SOMEDAY HE'LL BE
A GREAT SCIENTIST.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.160
YOU JUST WATCH HIM.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.371
YOU REALLY LIKE HIM,
DON'T YOU?

31:53.538 --> 31:55.540
MAYBE I DO.

31:55.707 --> 31:58.668
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

31:58.835 --> 32:01.838
I CAN KEEP A SECRET.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.881
WELL...

32:04.048 --> 32:08.011
I DO SET A GREAT STORE
BY HIM, NELLIE.

32:08.177 --> 32:11.723
I HOPE
HE LIKES ME, TOO.

32:11.889 --> 32:15.101
DID HE EVER SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT LIKING YOU?

32:15.268 --> 32:17.937
WELL, LAST NIGHT
HE SAID

32:18.104 --> 32:20.023
THAT MAYBE I COULD
BE A SCIENTIST,

32:20.189 --> 32:22.317
EVEN IF I AM A GIRL.

32:22.483 --> 32:26.821
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
I'D RATHER BE.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.657
SOMEDAY WE'LL HAVE
A BIG STORE

32:29.824 --> 32:31.451
THAT'LL HAVE A GREAT
BIG SIGN IN FRONT

32:31.618 --> 32:34.912
THAT SAYS,
"JASON AND LAURA:

32:35.079 --> 32:37.498
INVENTIONS DONE TO
ORDER WHILE YOU WAIT."

32:37.665 --> 32:39.584
I'LL NEVER BE
AS SMART AS HE IS,

32:39.751 --> 32:41.961
BUT I CAN WORK
AWFUL HARD AT IT.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.047
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT MA ALWAYS SAYS:

32:44.213 --> 32:46.799
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.093
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT PA SAYS:

32:49.260 --> 32:52.930
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK,
BUT WATCH OUT.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.850
WELL, I DON'T CARE.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.144
I THINK SHE'S CHANGED.

32:58.311 --> 33:00.104
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE,
YOU KNOW.

33:00.271 --> 33:01.481
I'LL BELIEVE IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

33:01.648 --> 33:04.108
SHE'S A SPITEFUL,
MEAN OLD THING,

33:04.275 --> 33:06.110
AND IF SHE GAVE YOU GUMDROPS, IT'S
'CAUSE SHE'S AFTER SOMETHING!

33:06.277 --> 33:09.781
WELL, SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING!
SHE WAS NICE AS PIE.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.282
Charles: WHAT ARE YOU
TWO TALKING ABOUT?

33:11.449 --> 33:13.493
LAURA'S TURNING
THE OTHER CHEEK.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.453
SO NELLIE CAN GIVE YOU
A GOOD LICK.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.121
OH, MARY.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.082
Charles: YOU BETTER GET To SLEEP.
YOU Go ON AND GET THE LIGHTS OUT.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.209
Mary: YES, SIR.

33:32.470 --> 33:36.015
YOU JUST WATCH HOW NICE
NELLIE IS TOMORROW AT SCHOOL.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.559
SHE'LL BE TOO BUSY SHOWING
OFF HER TALKING MACHINE.

33:38.726 --> 33:41.270
SHE TOLD MISS BEADLE
SHE'D BRING IT.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.980
WE'LL, YOU REMEMBER
WHAT MA ALWAYS SAYS--

33:43.147 --> 33:45.733
I KNOW, AND IF YOU'D JUST
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK,

33:45.900 --> 33:47.568
I COULD GO TO SLEEP.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.029
GOOD NIGHT!

33:50.196 --> 33:51.531
GOOD NIGHT.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.326
Jason: WHICH PUTS THE SOUND
VIBRATIONS ON TINFOIL

33:55.493 --> 33:58.162
LIKE PENCIL WRITES ON PAPER.

33:58.329 --> 34:00.957
[APPLAUSE]

34:05.503 --> 34:07.004
NOW, JASON HAS
EXPLAINED ABOUT

34:07.171 --> 34:09.424
THE SOUND VIBRATIONS
AND THE TINFOIL.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.175
ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

34:11.342 --> 34:12.427
YES, WILLIE?

34:12.593 --> 34:14.095
CAN HE MAKE IT
FLY FOR US?

34:14.262 --> 34:15.179
[LAUGHTER]

34:15.346 --> 34:17.390
CHILDREN! STAND IN
THE CORNER, WILLIE.

34:17.557 --> 34:19.517
YES, MA'AM.

34:19.684 --> 34:22.687
NELLIE, WOULD YOU PLEASE
DEMONSTRATE IT FOR US?

34:24.605 --> 34:27.859
Laura's voice: SOMEDAY MAYBE
WE'LL HAVE A BIG STORE TOGETHER

34:28.025 --> 34:29.694
WITH A SIGN ON THE FRONT--

34:29.861 --> 34:33.781
"LAURA AND JASON'S: INVENTIONS
DONE TO ORDER WHILE YOU WAIT."

34:33.948 --> 34:35.658
I'LL NEVER BE
AS SMART AS JASON,

34:35.825 --> 34:38.161
BUT I CAN WORK
AWFUL HARD AT IT.

34:38.327 --> 34:41.038
I GUESS I DO LOVE HIM
CONSIDERABLE,

34:41.205 --> 34:44.459
BUT I DON'T EXPECT WE'D GET
MARRIED FOR A WHILE YET.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.752
NELLIE, TURN IT OFF.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.336
I CAN'T.
THE LEVER'S STUCK.

34:47.503 --> 34:51.257
I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T,
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT JASON,

34:51.424 --> 34:53.885
I GET ALL WARM
AND CUDDLY INSIDE.

34:54.051 --> 34:54.802
[LAUGHTER]

34:54.969 --> 34:56.304
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!

34:56.471 --> 34:58.806
IN KNOW IT'S SILLY,
BUT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

34:58.973 --> 35:00.183
DON'T YOU EVER THINK--

35:02.518 --> 35:04.145
Mary: LAURA!

35:10.359 --> 35:12.528
LAURA!

35:12.695 --> 35:14.280
LAURA, WAIT!

36:25.935 --> 36:29.814
COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

36:29.981 --> 36:31.983
LEAVE ME ALONE.

36:32.149 --> 36:33.943
PLEASE, MARY.

36:34.110 --> 36:36.070
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.346
WHOA.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.519
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MARY?

37:08.686 --> 37:11.355
I TOLD LAURA NOT TO TRUST
THAT NELLIE OLESON.

37:11.522 --> 37:12.982
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:13.149 --> 37:16.444
NELLIE WAS VERY SWEET
TO LAURA YESTERDAY.

37:16.611 --> 37:20.031
SHE EVEN INVITED HER UP TO HER
ROOM TO TRY THE TALKING MACHINE.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.449
AND?

37:21.616 --> 37:23.659
SHE GOT LAURA TO SAY A WHOLE
BUNCH OF THINGS ABOUT JASON,

37:23.826 --> 37:25.202
A WHOLE BUNCH
OF LOVE STUFF.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.121
LAURA DIDN'T KNOW
THE MACHINE WAS ON,

37:27.288 --> 37:31.083
AND TODAY NELLIE PLAYED
IT FOR THE WHOLE CLASS.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.794
DEAR, SWEET NELLIE, HUH?

37:33.961 --> 37:35.087
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER NOW?

37:35.254 --> 37:36.797
UP ON OAK HILL.

37:36.964 --> 37:39.884
I TRIED TO GET HER TO COME HOME,
BUT SHE WAS FEELING TOO BAD.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.719
I'LL GO SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

37:41.886 --> 37:43.387
TAKE THE TEAM HOME
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

37:43.554 --> 37:45.139
YES, PA.

37:46.057 --> 37:47.975
GET UP!

38:26.597 --> 38:29.934
I WAS JUST TALKING TO MARY. YOU
HAD A PRETTY BAD DAY, HUH?

38:30.101 --> 38:31.936
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL EVER AGAIN.

38:32.103 --> 38:33.813
HEY, NOW, COME ON.
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.274
WORSE. HE MUST THINK I'M A SILLY
GOOSE SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.276
I DON'T THINK SO.

38:39.443 --> 38:42.780
HE'LL NEVER SPEAK
TO ME AGAIN...NEVER.

38:42.947 --> 38:46.450
WELL, IF HE DOESN'T, I DON'T
THINK HE'S WORTH CRYING ABOUT.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.537
SHE SAID
SHE WOULDN'T TELL.

38:49.704 --> 38:53.332
SHE SAID SHE WAS MY FRIEND,

38:53.499 --> 38:55.334
AND ALL THE TIME,

38:55.501 --> 38:57.461
SHE W-WAS...

38:57.628 --> 38:59.714
SHH.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.258
COME ON, NOW.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.927
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.307
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, PA.

39:10.474 --> 39:11.851
WELL, THEN, JUST
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.811
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

39:13.978 --> 39:17.481
NOW, WE GOT A LOT OF FUNNY NOTIONS
BORN INSIDE OF US, HALF-PINT,

39:17.648 --> 39:19.108
AND ONE OF
THE FUNNIEST IS

39:19.275 --> 39:21.819
THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HIDE
THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE.

39:21.986 --> 39:24.113
LET ME TELL YOU,
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW

39:24.280 --> 39:27.324
THAT THEY'RE LOVED OR
NEEDED OR CARED ABOUT.

39:27.491 --> 39:28.868
ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T
WANT TO KNOW THAT

39:29.035 --> 39:31.704
HAS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THEM.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.373
WHAT'LL HE THINK OF ME?

39:34.540 --> 39:38.794
IF HE LIKED YOU BEFORE, I THINK HE'S
GOING TO LIKE YOU A LOT MORE NOW.

39:38.961 --> 39:42.256
NOTHING BAD COMES FROM TELLING
PEOPLE HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

39:43.841 --> 39:47.344
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS RIGHT, PA.

39:47.511 --> 39:50.181
IT WAS JUST SUCH
A HURTFUL THING TO DO.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.349
I KNOW IT WAS.

39:52.516 --> 39:55.019
I KNOW IT WAS.

39:57.772 --> 40:01.192
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A SCIENTIST ANYMORE.

40:01.358 --> 40:04.153
I DON'T WANT TO INVENT
THINGS THAT HURT PEOPLE.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.739
WELL, IT'S NOT THE
INVENTIONS THAT HURT PEOPLE,

40:06.906 --> 40:10.367
IT'S THE PEOPLE AND THE WAY THEY USE THEM.
THAT'S WHAT HURTS.

40:10.534 --> 40:13.746
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

40:15.164 --> 40:16.540
NOW, LET'S SAY
YOU GO ON HOME

40:16.707 --> 40:18.542
BEFORE YOUR MA GETS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

40:18.709 --> 40:20.044
I GOT A FEW MORE
THINGS TO DO.

40:20.211 --> 40:22.213
I'LL BE A LITTLE
LATE FOR SUPPER.

40:22.379 --> 40:24.006
FEEL BETTER?

40:24.173 --> 40:26.592
ALL RIGHTY.
I LOVE YOU.

40:26.759 --> 40:27.676
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

40:27.843 --> 40:29.553
SEE YOU AT HOME.

40:50.032 --> 40:51.742
- MRS. OLESON.
- WELL, MR. INGALLS--

40:51.909 --> 40:53.577
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR
HUSBAND FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE.

40:53.744 --> 40:56.080
UH, WELL, HE'S BUSY
RIGHT NOW. MAYBE I--

40:56.247 --> 40:58.582
NELS!

40:58.749 --> 41:01.293
OH, CHARLES.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.837
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

41:03.003 --> 41:04.421
BUT DID NELLIE TELL YOU WHAT
HAPPENED IN SCHOOL TODAY?

41:04.588 --> 41:06.257
NO. SHE JUST MENTIONED
THAT SHE, UH,

41:06.423 --> 41:08.425
TOOK HER TALKING MACHINE
IN TO SHOW THE CLASS.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.344
SHE DIDN'T MENTION TO YOU
WHAT SHE PLAYED ON IT.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.637
WHY, NO,
SHE DIDN'T.

41:11.804 --> 41:13.472
SHE MADE A RECORDING
OF LAURA'S VOICE

41:13.639 --> 41:15.474
WITHOUT LAURA
KNOWING ABOUT IT.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.726
SHE PLAYED IT FOR THE CLASS.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.979
LAURA SAID SOME THINGS
ABOUT A BOY.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.814
THEY'RE THINGS THAT AREN'T
IMPORTANT TO A GROWNUP.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.524
TO A LITTLE GIRL
LIKE THAT--

41:23.691 --> 41:25.109
MR. INGALLS, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF--

41:25.276 --> 41:28.779
BE QUIET, HARRIET! SHE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT A BOY.

41:28.946 --> 41:29.697
WAS IT JASON?

41:29.864 --> 41:31.282
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.951
NELS, I USUALLY LIKE MY GIRLS
TO FIGHT THEIR OWN BATTLES,

41:34.118 --> 41:36.620
BUT IN THIS CASE, I WASN'T GOING TO
LET IT GO BY WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING.

41:36.787 --> 41:38.956
WAIT HERE.

41:40.791 --> 41:43.169
NELLIE.

41:43.335 --> 41:44.295
NELLIE!

41:44.461 --> 41:45.838
Nellie: YES, FATHER?

41:46.005 --> 41:51.135
COME DOWN HERE. AND BRING YOUR
TALKING MACHINE WITH YOU.

41:51.302 --> 41:52.303
NELS,
I REALLY THINK--

41:52.469 --> 41:54.972
WELL, DON'T, HARRIET.

42:06.150 --> 42:09.361
YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT
MACHINE IN SCHOOL TODAY?

42:09.528 --> 42:10.321
YES.

42:10.487 --> 42:11.655
WHAT DID YOU
PLAY ON IT?

42:11.822 --> 42:13.991
I WANT THE TRUTH,
OR SO HELP ME I'LL--

42:14.158 --> 42:15.492
I DIDN'T DO IT!
WILLIE DID IT--

42:15.659 --> 42:17.203
HID BEHIND THE BED
AND DID IT.

42:17.369 --> 42:18.787
NELLIE TOLD ME TO.

42:18.954 --> 42:21.916
YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM.

42:22.082 --> 42:23.125
AND YOU GO
TO YOUR ROOM.

42:23.292 --> 42:24.919
- MOTHER!
- NOW!

42:29.965 --> 42:34.136
CHARLES, I WANT YOU TO
APOLOGIZE TO LAURA FOR ME

42:34.303 --> 42:36.305
AND TELL HER IT WILL
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

42:36.472 --> 42:37.431
THAT'S A PROMISE.

42:37.598 --> 42:40.100
I'LL TELL HER.
THANK YOU, NELS.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.570
NELS! WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?

42:51.737 --> 42:54.657
SOMETHING I SHOULD
HAVE DONE YEARS AGO.

42:54.823 --> 42:57.368
NO! I WON'T
HEAR OF IT.

42:57.534 --> 43:00.120
CRANK.
YOU WON'T HAVE TO.

43:30.442 --> 43:32.987
CAN'T SLEEP?

43:33.153 --> 43:36.323
PA TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

43:36.490 --> 43:37.866
I KNOW.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.535
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU GO TO SLEEP?

43:39.702 --> 43:43.247
BECAUSE IT WON'T
BE ALL RIGHT.

43:43.414 --> 43:46.417
ALL THE BOYS LIKE YOU.

43:46.583 --> 43:47.626
WILLIE DOESN'T.

43:47.793 --> 43:50.087
WILLIE DOESN'T
LIKE ANYBODY.

43:50.254 --> 43:54.466
IF YOU LOSE A BOYFRIEND, YOU
CAN ALWAYS GET ANOTHER ONE.

43:54.633 --> 43:55.926
SO CAN YOU.

43:56.093 --> 43:59.013
NO, I CAN'T.

43:59.179 --> 44:00.931
I BET PA IS RIGHT.

44:01.098 --> 44:04.018
I BET JASON
STILL LIKES YOU.

44:05.936 --> 44:07.354
DO YOU THINK SO?

44:07.521 --> 44:09.481
SURE I DO.

44:09.648 --> 44:11.900
TRY AND SLEEP.

44:12.067 --> 44:14.153
ALL RIGHT.

44:23.203 --> 44:24.872
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MARY?

44:25.039 --> 44:27.249
NO, WHAT?

44:27.416 --> 44:31.920
LIFE SURE WAS A LOT EASIER
WHEN WE DIDN'T LIKE BOYS.

44:33.047 --> 44:36.258
COME ON. IT'S NOT
GOING TO BE SO BAD.

44:36.425 --> 44:38.469
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

44:38.635 --> 44:40.971
I DON'T THINK I CAN
EVEN LOOK AT HIM.

44:41.138 --> 44:43.515
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

44:55.569 --> 44:56.528
GOOD MORNING,
MISS BEADLE.

44:56.695 --> 44:57.613
GOOD MORNING,
NELLIE.

44:57.780 --> 44:58.697
MORNING, MISS BEADLE.

44:58.864 --> 45:00.657
WILLIE.

45:00.824 --> 45:04.286
ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN,
TIME FOR SCHOOL. COME ON.

45:23.013 --> 45:24.431
[GIGGLING]

45:48.622 --> 45:51.041
[CHILDREN GIGGLING]

46:14.064 --> 46:15.566
QUIET!

46:15.732 --> 46:19.820
NOW, I THINK THIS
HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

46:19.987 --> 46:22.614
I DON'T KNOW WHO DID THIS,
BUT I INTEND TO FIND OUT.

46:22.781 --> 46:24.324
NOW, WE'RE NOT
OPENING ONE BOOK

46:24.491 --> 46:27.244
UNTIL WHOEVER WROTE THIS ON
THE BLACKBOARD STANDS UP

46:27.411 --> 46:31.165
AND APOLOGIZES
TO JASON AND TO LAURA.

46:39.423 --> 46:40.257
NELLIE?

46:40.424 --> 46:42.092
I DIDN'T DO IT.

46:42.259 --> 46:43.886
I HOPE NOT.

46:44.052 --> 46:46.388
YOU'VE DONE
ENOUGH ALREADY.

46:50.476 --> 46:53.353
Miss Beadle:
WELL, I'M WAITING.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.613
I DID IT, MISS BEADLE,

47:02.779 --> 47:06.700
AND I'M NOT SORRY
'CAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.

47:08.285 --> 47:11.747
I SEE.

47:13.290 --> 47:16.877
Miss Beadle: WELL, LET'S
GET BACK TO BUSINESS.

47:17.044 --> 47:20.506
WILL YOU ALL PLEASE TURN
TO PAGE 28 IN YOUR READER?

47:42.361 --> 47:45.822
Laura, voice-over: I DIDN'T KNOW FOR
SURE IF I'D EVER BE A SCIENTIST

47:45.989 --> 47:48.408
OR EVEN IF I'D EVER
MARRY JASON.

47:48.575 --> 47:50.494
THE ONLY THING
I KNEW FOR SURE

47:50.661 --> 47:54.331
WAS WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS
TO KNOW HE LOVED ME.
