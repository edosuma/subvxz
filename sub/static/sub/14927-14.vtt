WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:06.607
THAT'S A BOY. YOU WERE
GREAT OUT THERE.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.243
KEEP UP THE FOOTWORK.
YOU'RE DAZZLING THEM.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.278
DAD, DAD.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.179
IT'S ALL ABOUT FLURRY.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.114
DAZZLE AND FLURRY
AND FLURRY AND DAZZLE--

00:13.147 --> 00:15.083
DAD, YOU'RE WRAPPING IT
TOO TIGHT.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.050
SORRY.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.218
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.652
I CAN'T FEEL MY FINGERS.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.887
THEY'RE NOT
YOUR FINGERS ANYMORE.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.324
THEY'RE STEELY
INSTRUMENTS OF MAYHEM.
INANIMATE MEAT HAMMERS.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.693
I CAN'T SCRATCH MY BUTT
WITH A MEAT HAMMER.

00:25.726 --> 00:26.560
UGH.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.297
DAD, YOU ARE GONNA
SLAUGHTER MR. O'KEEFE.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.700
YEAH. THE WAY HE BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF THOSE FIRST 2 GUYS...

00:32.733 --> 00:35.336
IT WAS LIKE--BAM, WHAM, BAM.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.704
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
SEE IT COMING.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.772
OK, COME ON, GUYS.
LOOK, THIS IS A CHARITY, OK?

00:38.806 --> 00:40.274
AND I'M DOING THIS THING
SO WE CAN RAISE MONEY

00:40.308 --> 00:42.343
FOR A GOOD CAUSE
AND TO CHALLENGE MYSELF.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.577
AND THAT'S WHAT
BOXING'S ALL ABOUT.

00:43.611 --> 00:47.548
IT'S ABOUT 2 MEN
CHALLENGING THEMSELVES
IN THE FIELD OF HONOR.

00:47.581 --> 00:51.485
DAD, THAT DIDN'T REALLY
LOOK LIKE HONOR.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.493
STAY DOWN, BUDDY.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.096
AAH!

01:02.130 --> 01:06.534
YOU'RE OUT. CLEAN-UP
ON AISLE 3. WHOO-HOO!

01:09.137 --> 01:13.174
TAKE IT TO HIM.
BODY, BODY, BODY, BODY.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.376
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.778
THAT'S MY BOY.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.349
IF THERE'S A FAT LADY HERE,
I'D APPRECIATE A SONG.

01:21.382 --> 01:25.353
THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.
YOU'RE OUT, BROTHER. WHOO!

01:25.386 --> 01:29.423
JIMMY, NOW,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN...

01:29.457 --> 01:30.424
WHEN A MAN...

01:30.458 --> 01:34.128
WHO AM I KIDDING? YOUR DAD
KICKED SOME MAJOR ASS!

01:34.162 --> 01:35.163
YEAH!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.878
GOD, IT STINKS IN HERE.

01:50.911 --> 01:51.945
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:51.979 --> 01:54.782
NEXT TO BOOZE AND TOBACCO,
THE SMELL OF A LOCKER ROOM

01:54.815 --> 01:57.385
IS THE MOST MANLY SMELL
YOU'RE EVER GONNA KNOW.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.787
SMELLS LIKE
UNDERPANTS.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.456
HEH. YOU'LL LEARN
TO LOVE IT.

02:02.490 --> 02:06.494
THAT SMELL REPRESENTS
GENERATIONS OF FINNERTYS.

02:06.527 --> 02:10.331
AND...WE'RE PROUD
OF THAT?

02:10.364 --> 02:13.167
WELL, SURE. WE FINNERTYS
ARE BORN FIGHTERS.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.736
MY FATHER REMINDED ME EVERY DAY.
IT'S IN OUR BLOOD.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.840
WALLY, I WANT YOU
COME AT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN,

02:19.873 --> 02:22.776
AND I PROMISE NOT
TO HIT YOU BACK, ALL RIGHT?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.513
ALL RIGHT, I JUST TAUGHT YOU
2 LESSONS THERE, SON--

02:25.546 --> 02:27.481
ALWAYS GUARD WITH YOUR LEFT.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.283
THAT WAS ONLY ONE LESSON.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.553
OK, HERE'S THE OTHER.
NEVER LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!

02:32.586 --> 02:33.954
AND DON'T START CRYING
TO YOUR MOTHER,

02:33.987 --> 02:37.425
OR I'LL TEACH YOU LESSON
NUMBER 3, YOU UNDERSTAND?

02:37.458 --> 02:41.262
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL MAKE
A MAN OF YOU YET.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.665
HOW I LOVED THAT MAN.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.701
COME ON, DAD.
HE SUCKER-PUNCHED YOU.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.737
YEAH. YOU
DO THAT NOW,

02:49.770 --> 02:50.704
PEOPLE CALL YOU
A BAD FATHER.

02:50.738 --> 02:55.776
SO, DAD, IF BOXING
IS SUCH A FAMILY TRADITION,

02:55.809 --> 02:57.745
HOW COME YOU NEVER DID IT?

02:57.778 --> 02:58.846
I USED TO BOX.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.047
YEAH, NO,
I REMEMBER.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.650
YEAH. YOUR DAD
USED TO FIGHT IN THIS
TOURNAMENT EVERY YEAR.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.886
BUT THEN, ONE DAY,
ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO,

03:05.919 --> 03:07.321
HE JUST WALKED AWAY.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.457
WHY DID YOU
WALK AWAY, DAD?

03:09.490 --> 03:10.658
NO REASON.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.925
WERE YOU SCARED?

03:11.959 --> 03:12.526
NO.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.695
DID YOU KILL A GUY?
NO.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.497
DID MOM MAKE YOU STOP?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.531
NO.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.399
DID MOM KILL A GUY?

03:18.432 --> 03:21.902
HE DOESN'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.873
IT'S A SOURCE
OF UNSPEAKABLE SHAME.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.977
YES. YES. YES.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.248
ALL RIGHT, SON,
PUT HIM DOWN THIS ROUND.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.849
THAT A BOY.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.460
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.695
YOU THINK?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.629
YEAH, YEAH, NO DOUBT.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.465
MAYBE YOU SHOULD EASE UP
ON THE GUY A LITTLE.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.866
YOU THINK I'M TIRING
MYSELF OUT TOO SOON?

03:52.900 --> 03:56.770
I JUST HAVE THE FEELING THAT
TONIGHT'S NOT YOUR NIGHT.

03:56.804 --> 03:57.738
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

03:57.771 --> 03:58.639
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.641
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
TONIGHT'S NOT MY NIGHT.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.010
UM, I MAY HAVE.
I WAS THINKING IT.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.312
WHY'S TONIGHT NOT MY NIGHT?

04:04.345 --> 04:08.582
UH, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU WERE GONNA
TAKE A DIVE TONIGHT.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.583
TAKE A DIVE?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.519
UM, IT WOULD MEAN
A LOT TO ME.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.853
YOU BET AGAINST ME?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.655
I DID NOT BET AGAINST YOU.
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

04:14.688 --> 04:18.992
BUT SOME INDIVIDUALS
OF MY ACQUAINTANCE DID.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.363
I OWE THEM BIG.
IF YOU HIT THE MAT,

04:22.396 --> 04:24.332
I CAN CONTINUE TO USE
MY INTERNAL ORGANS

04:24.365 --> 04:25.198
AS NATURE INTENDED.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.934
THESE GUYS ARE GONNA
KILL YOU OVER THAT?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.902
THIS IS JUST A STUPID
AMATEUR BOUT.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.473
EXACTLY, SO WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL IF YOU LOSE?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.742
I GOTTA LOSE TO THIS GUY?

04:35.943 --> 04:39.079
GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO DO IT. IT'S GONNA LOOK FAKE.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.682
YOU'LL BE FINE.
JUST DON'T CONCENTRATE.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.918
KEEP YOUR GUARD DOWN,
LET HIM HIT YOU.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.420
A LOT.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.959
GO!

04:55.929 --> 04:57.365
1, 2...

04:57.398 --> 05:00.734
GET UP, SEAN. GET UP.
YOU'RE A FINNERTY.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.869
SEAN, HOW COULD YOU...

05:01.902 --> 05:03.604
DO THAT?

05:03.637 --> 05:07.608
JEEZ, HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.513
BOO. BOO.
STAY DOWN.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.982
10. YOU'RE OUT.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.619
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THAT NIGHT.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.454
ALL THE STARES,
THE TAUNTINGS.

05:20.488 --> 05:24.057
MY GOOD FRIEND KYLE SAYING,
"YOUR BOY'S A QUITTER."

05:24.091 --> 05:28.061
I HAD TO BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.898
WHY DID YOU DO IT, DAD?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.966
YOU ALWAYS TELL US
TO DO OUR BEST.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.837
I DID IT FOR MY LITTLE BROTHER.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.973
DON'T YOU EVER TRY
TO MAKE ME THROW A FIGHT.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.775
LIKE YOU'D HAVE TO
PRETEND TO LOSE.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.077
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO I'D BE FIGHTING.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.448
COME ON, COME ON.
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.
SEAN!

05:47.481 --> 05:48.482
BABY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.484
CONNIE O'KEEFE'S BEEN
GOING AROUND TELLING PEOPLE

05:50.518 --> 05:53.153
THAT MY CHEST ISN'T REAL.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.988
MOM, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

05:55.022 --> 05:55.989
YEAH. SHE'S PROBABLY UPSET

05:56.023 --> 05:58.058
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO PUMMEL
HER HUSBAND SENSELESS.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.494
COME ON. I HATE THAT
SOMEBODY THINKS

06:00.528 --> 06:03.030
THAT I WOULD
DO SOMETHING
SO VAIN AND SHALLOW.

06:03.063 --> 06:06.099
LET IT GO, MOM.
YOU'RE BIGGER THAN THAT.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.970
GAHH! YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.005
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE PARANOID?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.542
HA HA HA. I KNOW WHAT I HEARD.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.777
OH, HE'S GOT IT.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.548
BODY BLOW, BODY BLOW.

06:20.581 --> 06:24.117
OH, YEAH. WHOO! YEAH.

06:24.151 --> 06:27.488
HO HO! YEAH!

06:27.521 --> 06:29.156
BRAD, SIT DOWN.

06:29.189 --> 06:33.026
MA, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET A BETTER LOOK.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.194
UH-HUH.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.465
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S SO EXCITED ABOUT.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.567
THEY'RE NOT REAL.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.135
IS SHE TALKING
ABOUT ME?

06:42.169 --> 06:45.473
NO. SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR RACK.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.008
YOU SHOULD BE
FLATTERED, CLAUDIA.

06:48.041 --> 06:52.446
PEOPLE PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
FOR THAT IMPLANT LOOK.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.516
I DON'T THINK SHE MEANT IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.885
WELL, I WONDER HOW CONNIE
O'KEEFE WOULD LIKE IT

06:57.918 --> 07:05.058
IF IT GOT OUT
THAT SHE USED TO BE
ANDREW VAN DER WAAL.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.059
A MAN.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.194
YOU'RE FULL OF...

07:07.227 --> 07:11.064
YES, I AM. BUT IF
SHE'S GONNA SPREAD
RUMORS ABOUT YOU,

07:11.098 --> 07:12.866
WHY SHOULDN'T WE
DO THE SAME TO HER?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.034
HER/HIM.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.538
YEAH...YOU KNOW,

07:17.571 --> 07:20.741
SHE DOES HAVE THAT
LITTLE FAINT MUSTACHE.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.011
YEAH, AND THAT
ADAM'S APPLE'S
NOT EXACTLY WOMANLY.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.147
HEH HEH. GOOD POINT.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.817
DAD, WE JUST SAW
MR. O'KEEFE,

07:29.850 --> 07:32.119
AND I DON'T KNOW,
HE LOOKS PRETTY STRONG.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.622
YOUR DAD IS GONNA HAVE
NO PROBLEM WITH O'KEEFE

07:34.655 --> 07:37.024
'CAUSE YOUR DAD IS FIGHTING
WITH PURE RAGE.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.126
NO, I'M NOT. COME ON.
IT'S A FRIENDLY RIVALRY.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.028
DAD, YOU'VE
BEEN WALKING AROUND
THE HOUSE FOR A WEEK

07:41.061 --> 07:44.532
SAYING THAT YOU WANNA
PUNCH HIS TEETH THROUGH
THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.266
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.135
OK, I ADMIT IT.
I HATE THE GUY.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.505
HE'S ALWAYS PRESSING
MY FREAKING BUTTONS.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.715
GOOD GIRL, BRANDY.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.753
HEY. HEY, I SAW THAT.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.687
SAW WHAT?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.121
YOUR DOG TAKING CARE
OF BUSINESS ON OUR WALK.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.690
SHE DOES IT EVERY DAY.

08:09.723 --> 08:10.624
IT WASN'T MY DOG.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.825
I JUST SAW HER DO IT.

08:11.859 --> 08:12.860
IT'S MY WIFE'S DOG.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.595
OH, THAT'S WITTY.
YOU'RE A REAL WIT.

08:14.628 --> 08:18.498
UH-OH. HE'S GETTING ANGRY.
PROTECT ME, BRANDY.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.870
HEY, BOYS, WHY DON'T YOU
ASK YOUR OLD MAN

08:22.903 --> 08:26.239
WHY HE DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR THE PBA BOXING TOURNEY
AGAIN THIS YEAR?

08:26.273 --> 08:29.009
WHY DIDN'T YOU SIGN UP
FOR THE PBA BOXING TOURNEY?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.878
YOU KNOW, HENRY, I HAVE
BETTER THINGS TO DO.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.880
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BETTER,

08:32.913 --> 08:35.983
WHAT WITH ME IN THE BEST SHAPE
OF MY LIFE, AND YOU,

08:36.016 --> 08:36.850
WELL, YOU KNOW...

08:36.884 --> 08:39.119
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.220
OH, COME ON. LOOK AT YOU.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.990
I'D TURN YOU INTO
A RED-HEADED SMUDGE
ON THE CANVAS.

08:43.023 --> 08:43.591
YOU THINK SO?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.258
SURE AS I'M STANDING HERE.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.326
YEAH?
YEAH.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.095
IS THAT SIGN-UP SHEET STILL
DOWN AT THE REC CENTER?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.062
RIGHT WHERE IT ALWAYS IT.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.331
THEN I'M GOING DOWN THERE
AND PUTTING MY NAME

08:51.364 --> 08:52.800
RIGHT NEXT TO YOURS.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.101
WANNA BORROW MY PEN?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.269
ISN'T THERE ONE HANGING
ON A LITTLE STRING
BY THE BULLETIN BOARD?

08:56.303 --> 08:57.204
I SUPPOSE THERE IS.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.205
THEN I'LL USE THAT ONE.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.141
YOU DO THAT.
I WILL.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.911
AAH!

09:03.944 --> 09:06.179
OH, DAD, YOU JUST
STEPPED RIGHT IN--

09:06.213 --> 09:08.616
I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.655
BUT TONIGHT, OK,
O'KEEFE'S GONNA
STEP IN IT.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.355
STEP IN WHAT?

09:15.388 --> 09:18.726
A BIG, STEAMING
PILE OF PAIN.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.263
HI, CLAUDIA.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.165
HEY, WENDY. HOW'S IT GOING?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.667
GREAT. GREAT.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.500
UH, SORRY ABOUT SEAN

09:27.534 --> 09:31.171
BEATING THE CRAP
OUT OF BILL OUT THERE.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.372
IT'S FOR CHARITY.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.874
YEAH.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.044
LISTEN, CLAUDIA,
I WAS JUST WONDERING...

09:37.077 --> 09:38.812
WHO DID YOUR WORK?

09:38.846 --> 09:40.147
WHAT WORK?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.249
YOUR, YOU KNOW...

09:42.282 --> 09:43.951
WORK.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.988
THESE BOOBS ARE NATURAL.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.158
THEY ARE VERY NATURAL.
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.360
NO, I MEAN, THEY'RE MINE.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.396
OK, FINE,
DON'T TELL ME.

09:56.429 --> 10:02.135
BUT, FRANKLY, EVERYBODY
THINKS YOU OVERDID IT.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.873
WHO IS EVERYBODY?
WHO THE HELL IS EVERYBODY?!

10:05.906 --> 10:07.274
WHAT IS GOING ON?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.710
I DUNNO. MAYBE PEOPLE
ARE JEALOUS.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.880
JEALOUS? I FEEL LIKE
I'M BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.683
AND IT IS FOR
ALL THESE REASONS

10:15.716 --> 10:20.087
THAT WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT
WALTER MONDALE.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.656
REBUTTAL.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.257
REBUTTAL.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.626
UM, WHAT DID
YOU SAY?

10:27.928 --> 10:32.032
OK, LADIES,
JUMPING JACKS.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.635
UH, COACH, UM...

10:36.236 --> 10:37.905
I FEEL SICK.

10:37.938 --> 10:38.571
OK, SIT IT OUT.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.875
AW, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
COME ON!

10:41.909 --> 10:45.378
YOU THINK YOU
GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA CHANGE,

10:45.412 --> 10:46.513
BUT I GUESS NOT, RIGHT?

10:46.546 --> 10:51.418
IF IT'S NOT A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY,
IT'S A 40-YEAR-OLD BITCH.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.755
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING JUST A LITTLE HARSH?

10:54.788 --> 11:01.294
NO. WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD START
SUCH A STUPID, VICIOUS RUMOR?

11:01.328 --> 11:06.433
I'M SURE WHOEVER IT WAS
DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.438
I SWEAR THEY DIDN'T.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.342
FINNERTY, YOU'RE UP
IN 10 MINUTES.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.711
OH, WE BETTER
GO GET OUR SEATS.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.980
DON'T RELAX. THIS THING'S
GONNA BE OVER QUICK.

11:20.013 --> 11:20.881
DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE RING.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.250
YOU DON'T WANT O'KEEFE'S
GUTS ALL OVER YOU.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.319
I DO.
HEY...

11:26.519 --> 11:27.755
HEY, HEY, HEY.

11:27.788 --> 11:32.259
I WAS JUST CHECKING OUT O'KEEFE.
YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.093
REALLY?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.928
I'M SURE OF IT.
TONIGHT'S YOUR NIGHT.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.964
THANKS, BUDDY.

11:36.997 --> 11:37.831
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.734
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TONIGHT'S MY NIGHT"?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.269
I GOT A REAL GOOD FEELING.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.304
YEAH

11:44.337 --> 11:47.207
GOOD ENOUGH THAT I PUT
SOME MONEY ON YOU.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.341
EDDIE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.477
NOTHING, NOTHING,
NOTHING.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.180
YOU GO HAVE FUN.
IT'S YOUR NIGHT.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.282
YOU FIXED THE FIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.150
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.087
I JUST ELIMINATED
ONE OF THE VARIABLES.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.391
YOUR OPPONENT'S DESIRE TO WIN.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.426
OH, NO.

12:06.459 --> 12:10.330
THAT'S GOOD. GOOD, DO THAT.
IT MAKES IT LOOK REAL.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.037
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU, MAN.
YOU'RE MY BROTHER!

12:17.070 --> 12:19.006
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.374
TO YOU
FOR YOU.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.977
HE'S GONNA TAKE A DIVE,
YOU'RE GONNA WIN.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.813
I DIDN'T NEED YOU
TO PUT THE FIX ON.

12:25.846 --> 12:26.780
OH, YOU WANTED TO LOSE?

12:26.814 --> 12:27.815
NO, I WANTED TO BEAT HIM.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.282
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA.
BUT FOR REAL.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.185
ARE THERE DIFFERENT KINDS
OF WINNING NOW?

12:32.219 --> 12:32.986
WINNING IS WINNING.

12:33.020 --> 12:33.887
COME ON, MAN.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.857
O'KEEFE HATES MY GUTS.
HE'S NOT GONNA DIVE.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.526
I MANAGED TO TALK HIM INTO IT.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.929
I'LL GIVE YOU $500
TO THROW THE FIGHT.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.898
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
JUST HOW MUCH

12:44.932 --> 12:47.034
I HATE YOUR BROTHER'S GUTS.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.869
I'LL MAKE IT 1,000.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.004
DONE.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.906
A THOUSAND BUCKS?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.407
WHAT, O'KEEFE GETS
A THOUSAND BUCKS,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.109
AND I GET DINNER FOR 2
AT CONNIE'S?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.911
SEAN, I'M DOING
THIS FOR YOU.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.813
I'M NOT MAKING
A PENNY OFF THIS.

12:59.847 --> 13:00.580
OH, REALLY?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.950
BEYOND EXPENSES
AND OVERHEAD, NO.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.951
AW...

13:03.984 --> 13:06.920
OH, YOU REMEMBER THAT FIGHT
I FIXED 5 YEARS AGO?

13:06.954 --> 13:07.888
YEAH.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.823
I ALWAYS FELT BAD ABOUT THAT.
THAT WAS WRONG.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.191
NOW I'M GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.325
BY FIXING ANOTHER FIGHT?

13:12.359 --> 13:15.963
YEAH, BUT THIS TIME,
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.497
I'M LIKE THE MOD SQUAD.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.101
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO GO
IN THERE AND FIGHT THIS GUY
WHO'S NOT GONNA FIGHT BACK?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.170
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO WIN BACK MY HONOR?

13:23.203 --> 13:25.072
LISTEN, SEAN,
YOUR HONOR'S IN THE BAG.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.475
I DON'T WANNA
WIN THAT WAY.
I'D RATHER LOSE.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.210
WELL, IF YOU WANNA LOSE,
LOSE NEXT YEAR, ALL RIGHT?

13:30.243 --> 13:33.947
THIS YEAR, AS SOON AS YOU
TOUCH HIM, HE'S GONNA GO DOWN.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.382
OH...

13:36.449 --> 13:38.418
ALL RIGHT, DON'T OVERDO THAT.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.087
MOM, JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.589
OH, WHAT POSSIBLE EXPLANATION
CAN THERE BE

13:42.622 --> 13:44.958
FOR TELLING PEOPLE
I HAVE FAKE BOOBS?

13:44.992 --> 13:46.126
THERE WERE REASONS.

13:46.159 --> 13:46.894
LIKE WHAT?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.329
OK, LOOK, YOU ARE NOT
THE ONLY ONE

13:49.362 --> 13:53.066
WHO'S SICK AND TIRED
OF HEARING ABOUT YOUR BOOBS.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.169
MAN, WHO'S THAT?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.471
THAT'S LILY'S MOM.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.539
NO WAY.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.241
OH, YEAH.

14:01.641 --> 14:05.045
NICE SWEATER.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.647
ONE TIME, I THINK I SAW HALF
THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THEM.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.515
SERIOUSLY?
YEAH.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.517
SHE'S REACHING UP
TO CLEAN OUT A GUTTER,

14:10.550 --> 14:12.219
WE'RE TALKING NO BRA.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.988
ARE YOU GUYS TALKING
ABOUT LILY'S MOM'S BOOBS?

14:15.022 --> 14:15.822
OH, YEAH!

14:15.855 --> 14:19.026
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.593
THEY'RE NOT EVEN REAL.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.662
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.466
WHY DO YOU THINK WE CAN'T
AFFORD A BETTER CAR?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.670
OHH...MOM, I'M SORRY.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.907
YOU KNOW, LILY,
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.177
I AM A WOMAN. AND
WOMEN HAVE BREASTS.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.047
AND I'M NOT GONNA
COVER 'EM UP WITH
SWEATSHIRTS

14:40.080 --> 14:42.615
OR STARVE MYSELF
UNTIL THEY GO AWAY.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.052
I DON'T HAVE TO BE
ASHAMED OF MY BODY.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.021
NOBODY SHOULD BE SHAMED
OF WHO THEY ARE.

14:48.055 --> 14:53.193
WELL, THAT'S EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY. YOU'VE GOT HUGE BOOBS.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.931
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
I JUST...SAID?

14:57.965 --> 14:59.299
OH, HI, CLAUDIA.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.401
HI, CONNIE.
HI, WENDY.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.671
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK,
AND IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME

15:04.704 --> 15:07.407
BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING TO PROVE,
AND I DON'T CARE.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.310
WELL, WHATEVER.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.647
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE WAY
THAT YOU SAID WHATEVER

15:14.681 --> 15:16.049
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.252
WHICH IS FINE 'CAUSE I
DON'T REALLY CARE WHETHER
YOU BELIEVE ME OR NOT.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.420
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE HAPPY.

15:20.453 --> 15:24.024
AND I AM HAPPY.
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.327
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE
WITH MYSELF.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.496
RIGHT. BYE, THEN.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.331
BYE.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.303
OK, THAT'S IT. DON'T
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.471
YOU MAKE THE CALL.

15:40.673 --> 15:45.045
WOW!
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT--

15:45.078 --> 15:48.181
WHAT THE--
I MISSED IT!

15:48.215 --> 15:52.052
NO, WAIT! THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING TO ME!

15:52.085 --> 15:53.386
WAIT!

15:54.387 --> 15:56.323
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.658
IN THIS CORNER,
THE CHALLENGER,

15:58.691 --> 16:03.263
WEIGHING 188 POUNDS,
5'11" TALL,

16:03.296 --> 16:07.534
THE RED-HEADED MENACE--
SEAN FINNERTY!

16:10.770 --> 16:11.771
YEAH!

16:11.804 --> 16:16.176
AND IN THIS CORNER,
THE CHAMPION 4 YEARS RUNNING,

16:16.209 --> 16:21.714
STANDING 6'1" TALL,
WEIGHING 185 POUNDS,

16:21.748 --> 16:24.284
DANGEROUS DAN O'KEEFE.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.156
GO, DANNY! GO, DANNY!

16:29.189 --> 16:30.090
ALL RIGHT, NOW I WANT
A CLEAN FIGHT.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.226
NO RABBIT PUNCHES,
NO HITTING BELOW THE BELT.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.328
AND WHEN I TELL YOU
TO BREAK, BREAK CLEAN.

16:35.362 --> 16:40.333
NOW SHAKE HANDS
AND COME OUT FIGHTING.

16:41.234 --> 16:45.172
FINE, DON'T.
SEE IF I GIVE A DAMN.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.242
ALL RIGHT, SEAN,
GO OUT THERE AND DO US PROUD.

16:49.276 --> 16:52.379
AND DON'T WORRY. I'VE STERILIZED
SOME RAZOR BLADES.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.213
FOR WHAT?

16:53.246 --> 16:54.214
I'M YOUR CUT MAN.
IN CASE YOU PUFF UP.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.616
I'M NOT PUFFING UP UNLESS
I GET STUNG BY A BEE.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.418
THAT A BOY.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.320
GET HIM.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.313
COME ON, FINNERTY,
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

17:26.346 --> 17:29.149
I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO BRING IT.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.419
OH, I BROUGHT IT.
IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.120
WHY DON'T YOU COME AND GET IT?

17:33.153 --> 17:35.088
WHY DON'T YOU
COME AND GET IT?

17:35.122 --> 17:38.491
OH, YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.193
YEAH? WELL, BRING IT.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.394
I'M GONNA BRING IT.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.363
I DON'T SEE YOU
BRINGING NOTHING.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.731
YOU BRING IT!

17:47.867 --> 17:49.436
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, SEANY?

17:49.469 --> 17:52.705
HE'S NO GONNA GO DOWN IF YOU
DON'T HIT HIM AT LEAST ONCE.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.176
I KNOW. I KNOW.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.244
WHAT'S DAD DOING?

17:57.277 --> 18:02.315
GUARANTEEING US
A BUTT-KICKING
IN SCHOOL TOMORROW.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.883
OK, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.784
YOU DON'T IT TO BE OBVIOUS.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.719
JUST REMEMBER,
YOU ONLY GOT 3 ROUNDS HERE.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.322
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS MAKE CONTACT.
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.390
I'M NOT DOING IT, EDDIE.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.359
COME ON, SEAN. YOU GOT
A CHANCE TO BE A WINNER HERE.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.827
EMBRACE SUCCESS.
SAY "YES" TO YOU.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.630
YOU CAN KISS MY--

18:23.836 --> 18:27.540
CAN'T DANCE FOREVER, O'KEEFE.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.909
I'M RIGHT HERE.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.878
ALL RIGHT.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.180
OHH!

18:33.213 --> 18:34.781
HEY, REF, THAT'S
A DISQUALIFICATION.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.150
HE GOT HIM
RIGHT IN THE GOODS.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.385
DAD WINS.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.320
THAT'S A DISQUALI--
NO!

18:40.353 --> 18:41.288
NO DISQUALIFICATION.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.590
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
WHY WOULD SEAN DO THAT?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.759
I DUNNO.
SOME CRAP ABOUT HONOR.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.902
NO! NO DISQUALIFICATION.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.450
OH...GOD...

19:34.874 --> 19:38.411
YOU IDIOT, FINNERTY.
TAKE A STUPID WIN.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.514
I AM WINNING. YOU'RE NOT
GETTING YOUR MONEY.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.284
YOUR BROTHER
CAN KEEP HIS MONEY.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.587
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.756
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO HEAR.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.564
1...2...3...

19:57.597 --> 19:59.732
4...

20:00.267 --> 20:04.337
GOOD WORK, SEANY.
I'LL GET YOU SOME ICE
FOR YOUR PACKAGE.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.406
I WANTED TO MAKE IT EASY
FOR YOU, SEAN.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.342
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME EDDIE--

20:09.376 --> 20:10.743
I LIKE TO EARN MY VICTORIES.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.545
YEAH, IT LOOKS PRETTY SWEET.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.382
IT IS SWEET
'CAUSE IT'S REAL.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.551
9...10.
YOU'RE OUT.

20:18.585 --> 20:22.889
THE WINNER.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.397
HURRY IT UP
WITH THAT ICE, DAD.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.433
HEY, MISS FINNERTY.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.468
HI, BRAD.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.605
UM, LOOK...

20:38.638 --> 20:41.474
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS TO YOU

20:41.508 --> 20:44.411
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.680
YOU KNOW, ABOUT...

20:52.485 --> 20:54.487
MY BREASTS?

20:55.522 --> 20:57.724
YEAH, AND...HEH.

20:57.757 --> 21:01.628
I HAVE TO SAY,
I'M STILL SKEPTICAL.

21:02.662 --> 21:06.733
SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY

21:06.766 --> 21:10.470
TO JUST ONCE AND FOR ALL...
