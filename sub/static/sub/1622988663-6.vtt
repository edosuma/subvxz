19:13.524 --> 19:14.258
Benny. Um,

19:14.358 --> 19:16.219
what are you doing up
at this hour?

19:16.319 --> 19:18.179
I could ask the same thing
of you, Rev.

19:18.279 --> 19:20.766
Um, are you--
you going somewhere?

19:20.866 --> 19:24.019
I sure am.
Far away from here.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.563
I made a big mistake tonight,

19:26.663 --> 19:27.606
and it's your fault.

19:27.706 --> 19:29.525
How--how is it my fault?

19:29.625 --> 19:31.068
'Cause you made me soft!

19:31.168 --> 19:33.195
All your stupid
"love thy neighbour" crap

19:33.295 --> 19:36.324
must've rubbed off on me,
and it made me weak.

19:36.424 --> 19:40.578
No, Benny, that--
that is not weakness.

19:40.678 --> 19:41.412
That's strength.

19:41.512 --> 19:44.123
That means deep down inside,
you are a good person.

19:44.223 --> 19:47.377
Don't say that!
I'm Benny the Teen, god damn it!

19:47.477 --> 19:49.630
The meanest son of a bitch
there is.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.441
And nobody can take that
away from me.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.468
But, no, I mean,
you can't just leave us!

19:54.568 --> 19:56.679
We'll never get to Oregon
without you.

19:56.779 --> 20:00.182
That's not my problem.
Maybe you haven't heard.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.660
I'm a bad guy.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.104
MARTHA:
Is that Benny?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.289
What is going on
out here?

20:08.917 --> 20:10.819
We're [bleep].
