WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.579
Audrey: Previously on Haven...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.251
Nathan: The Troubles are still here.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.919
- How much more can people take?
(gun fires)

00:06.007 --> 00:07.087
Vince: There's a lot we
don't understand.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.631
(horn honks)
The only thing that's the same

00:08.718 --> 00:10.583
(crackling)
is that you always help the Troubled.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.793
Dave: You always look the same,

00:11.888 --> 00:14.550
but you have a new person's memory
each time you return.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.629
Vince: You were Lucy.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.181
Before that, Sarah.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.133
Before that, we're not sure.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.263
William: You got to get this idea
out of your head

00:20.354 --> 00:21.890
that you're here
to fix the Troubles.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.016
Why do you think you're the one

00:23.107 --> 00:25.268
who has to come back to haven
over and over?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.566
The real you?
You made the Troubles.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.609
- My original self, her
name was Mara.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.312
William: You don't know
what's happening inside you.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.023
Your family has been absorbing
Troubles into it's blood

00:34.118 --> 00:35.483
for generations.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.284
Every Trouble,
all crammed in there,

00:37.371 --> 00:38.360
becomes something more deadly

00:38.456 --> 00:40.412
than Mara and I
could ever imagine.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.000
Duke: William's giving out Troubles.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.449
William: Cry...

00:44.212 --> 00:46.248
Die.
Audrey: I have to stop these deaths

00:46.339 --> 00:47.374
and save the baby.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.001
Now you want me
to re-Trouble you

00:49.091 --> 00:51.127
so that you can kill
that baby's father?

00:51.219 --> 00:53.676
- You felt her, your
original self, and you liked it.

00:53.763 --> 00:55.424
Audrey's started turning
back into the woman

00:55.514 --> 00:57.015
that William's been waiting for.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.260
Jennifer: We have to put William and all
the evil that he brought with him

00:59.352 --> 01:00.467
back on the other side.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.801
I have to do this, Duke.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.056
I'm the only one who can.

01:03.147 --> 01:05.012
- This, I want to do myself.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.483
(groaning, crackling)

01:06.567 --> 01:08.307
- I knew you were in there.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.017
(Duke screaming, crackling)

01:11.739 --> 01:13.070
(thudding)
Jennifer!

01:13.157 --> 01:14.567
- We never should have
opened the door.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.490
William wasn't who we
should have been afraid of.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.158
Duke: Jennifer.
She's not breathing.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.406
Jennifer!

01:19.497 --> 01:21.579
- What's happening to Duke?
- He's as good as dead.

01:21.666 --> 01:22.872
(shuddering)

01:22.959 --> 01:26.247
Now, who's going to help me
get William back?

01:30.216 --> 01:31.205
Nathan: Mara.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.632
J‘J‘

01:36.430 --> 01:39.297
(waves lapping)

01:39.392 --> 01:40.757
Gloria: Did you know that baby's bones

01:40.851 --> 01:42.887
stay rubbery for the first
two years of their lives?

01:44.563 --> 01:46.349
That could come in handy
growing up in Haven.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.429
(chucang)

01:50.820 --> 01:52.606
- You really gonna raise him?

01:54.198 --> 01:56.280
- Aaron lost both
his parents today.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.698
You bet I am.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.865
Hey, little guy?

01:58.953 --> 01:59.942
(baby cries)

02:00.037 --> 02:01.026
Oh.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.204
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.823
Oh, come here, big man.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.124
Okay, I got ya.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.210
It's all right, Vickie.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.586
(baby crying)
His family's Trouble is gone now.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.127
Aaron's cries can't
hurt anyone anymore.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.722
- This is the longest the Troubles
have ever been in Haven.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.101
What if it stays
this way forever?

02:26.188 --> 02:27.177
- We'll cope.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.146
Haven always does.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.889
(crying continues)

02:31.902 --> 02:33.278
- Here, let me try.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.351
- No, I got this.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.436
I got it.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.487
(crying continues)

02:39.493 --> 02:41.529
I haven't got this.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.406
Vickie, what am I doing?

02:44.373 --> 02:46.238
18 years of decisions?

02:47.126 --> 02:50.118
Which lunch box
do the cool kids have?

02:50.212 --> 02:52.077
When do I give him
his first iPhone?

02:52.173 --> 02:54.334
Oh, my god, by the time
he's ready for the sex talk,

02:54.425 --> 02:55.915
I'm gonna be 80 years old.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.875
(baby crying louder)

03:00.056 --> 03:01.171
- Let's try something.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.089
- Whoa, no.
What are you doing with that?

03:04.185 --> 03:07.177
- Gloria, you know I don't
use my Trouble, ever.

03:08.481 --> 03:09.470
Desperate times.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.682
(crying continues)

03:15.112 --> 03:19.230
J‘J‘

03:26.374 --> 03:28.080
(blowing)

03:29.085 --> 03:32.828
J‘J‘

03:32.922 --> 03:36.005
(crying ceases)

03:45.768 --> 03:48.134
(baby cooing)

04:02.827 --> 04:04.658
(low rumbling)

04:04.745 --> 04:06.827
(loud crashing)

04:09.583 --> 04:10.834
- Vickie.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.998
Vickie?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.246
- That was not me.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.622
(baby crying, rumbling)

04:14.713 --> 04:16.374
- Is it an earthquake?

04:16.465 --> 04:18.456
(rumbling continues)

04:21.846 --> 04:23.928
Oh, God.
Vickie, are you sure?

04:24.014 --> 04:25.629
- It's not my Trouble
doing this.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.975
I swear.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.971
(whooshing)

04:36.318 --> 04:39.981
(crumbling and cracking)

04:48.330 --> 04:50.946
- Wow, that lighthouse
just can't catch a break.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.577
- Oh, my god.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.249
What if there were
people in there?

04:58.048 --> 05:00.425
J‘J‘

05:03.095 --> 05:04.084
(gasps)

05:05.097 --> 05:07.133
Duke: Jennifer, where are you?

05:10.769 --> 05:12.976
(waves lapping)

05:18.819 --> 05:19.979
Jennifer!

05:21.989 --> 05:23.820
Jennifer, can you hear me?

05:23.908 --> 05:24.897
Dwight: Duke.

05:26.911 --> 05:27.900
Duke?

05:27.995 --> 05:28.984
You all right?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.489
(Duke breathing heavily)

05:30.581 --> 05:32.446
- Yeah, I think so.
- What happened?

05:32.541 --> 05:33.701
- I don't know.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.998
Where the hell are we?

05:35.085 --> 05:36.074
- Last thing I remember,

05:36.170 --> 05:38.536
we were in the cave
underneath the lighthouse.

05:38.631 --> 05:41.168
- I swear, living in this town
is like being a blackout drunk.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.247
Jennifer!

05:42.343 --> 05:44.334
- We got to find the others.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.218
- Straight to voicemail.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.713
- Listen, what happened to you
back at the cave, man?

05:49.808 --> 05:50.968
Why were your eyes bleeding?

05:54.688 --> 05:55.848
- I'm not sure.

05:55.940 --> 05:56.929
- We should get you
to a doctor.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.013
- Oh, really?

05:58.108 --> 06:00.599
And what kind would you suggest?
Ear, nose, and throat?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.559
- Haven has doctors
who know about the Troubles.

06:02.655 --> 06:03.861
- Forget it--
Just"

06:04.949 --> 06:06.189
We'll cover more
ground if we split up.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.148
Just call me if you find anyone.

06:08.244 --> 06:10.030
Jennifer!

06:11.413 --> 06:13.324
J‘J‘

06:13.415 --> 06:14.404
(panting)

06:15.543 --> 06:17.534
Dave: How the hell did we get here?

06:17.628 --> 06:19.459
(sighs)
Vince: Never mind that.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.412
Just a little further.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.213
We're only a mile or so
from town.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.635
- I told you.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.801
We should never
have opened that door.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.264
- Oh, stop that.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.680
William is gone,
and you're still here.

06:31.767 --> 06:35.851
All your doom and gloom
didn't come to pass, as usual.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.519
- How can you say that?

06:37.606 --> 06:39.187
- I know you've been shot,

06:39.275 --> 06:40.981
and I'd be more sympathetic

06:41.068 --> 06:42.524
if you hadn't been
shooting at me.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.233
Nathan: Audrey!

06:51.287 --> 06:52.276
Audrey!

06:53.664 --> 06:54.653
- Nathan!

06:56.584 --> 06:57.994
- Audrey.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.791
Oh, thank God.

06:59.878 --> 07:04.497
J‘J‘

07:04.592 --> 07:06.128
(sighing)

07:06.218 --> 07:08.083
I was afraid I'd lost you.
(metal clinking)

07:08.178 --> 07:11.841
- The handsome ones just don't
have to be very smart, do they?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.600
(gun cocks, metal clangs)

07:14.977 --> 07:16.057
(Audrey chuckles)

07:16.145 --> 07:17.134
(tittering)

07:19.732 --> 07:20.847
- Mara.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.023
- Ta-da!

07:23.110 --> 07:24.145
(metal clangs)

07:24.236 --> 07:25.225
Hmm.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.144
- Did you bring us here?

07:27.239 --> 07:29.696
- To this garden spot?
No.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.865
That door must have been made
to blast everyone away.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.567
Obnoxious thing.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.198
- But how?

07:35.289 --> 07:36.278
- You haven't seen Jennifer,
have you?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.039
- Why do you want Jennifer?

07:39.126 --> 07:42.869
- Why do you think I'm going
to answer any of your questions?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.123
- What?

07:46.967 --> 07:47.956
- Oh.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.257
You think she's
still in there, don't you?

07:54.558 --> 07:56.970
Nope, not one iota.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.676
J‘J‘

07:58.771 --> 08:00.727
I have all of her memories,
though.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.975
Lucy, Sarah.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.056
mm

08:04.151 --> 08:05.937
So much annoying... clutter.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.195
Look, the reason
I want to find Jennifer

08:10.282 --> 08:12.489
is because I have
a job for her.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.532
I have to continue my work.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.703
All of these little gifts
that we've given you

08:17.790 --> 08:18.950
have turned out
to be so much better

08:19.041 --> 08:21.077
than I could have
ever imagined.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.669
And the new ones...

08:23.337 --> 08:25.828
the new ones are gonna be
exactly what I need.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.505
- Why do you need the Troubles?

08:28.592 --> 08:29.957
- Why do you carry
one of these?

08:31.053 --> 08:32.759
Get ready for
a lot more of them

08:32.846 --> 08:35.178
as soon as I get William back.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.096
- Please...

08:37.184 --> 08:39.300
- Parker.
- My name is Mara.

08:40.521 --> 08:43.513
And stop staring at me
with those wet eyes.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.228
The last 500 years
have been torture for me.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.069
And the worst part was being
Audrey Parker.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.145
(scoffs)

08:53.701 --> 08:54.690
- No.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.401
Audrey is stronger than you.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.781
- No, she's not.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.954
(grunts, metal clangs)

09:02.626 --> 09:06.869
J‘J‘

09:35.409 --> 09:37.070
Duke: Jennifer!

09:38.996 --> 09:41.112
Jennifer!

09:42.583 --> 09:44.289
Jennifer!

09:45.753 --> 09:46.993
Nathan: Duke!

09:47.087 --> 09:48.076
Over here!

09:49.381 --> 09:51.246
- What the hell
happened to you?

09:51.341 --> 09:52.330
You're cuffed.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.007
- Just get this thing off.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.959
- Yeah.
Uh...

09:58.932 --> 10:01.184
- You seen anyone else
from the cave?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.474
- Vince and Dave

10:02.853 --> 10:04.844
landed somewhere a couple miles
outside of town.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.018
Dwight just called
to say he's on his way

10:06.106 --> 10:08.097
to meet them at the hospital.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.770
Nobody's heard from
Audrey or Jennifer yet.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.067
- Mara hurt Jennifer.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.820
- Audrey turned back into Mara.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.364
Well, that explains the cuffs.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.691
- She got my phone,

10:18.786 --> 10:19.901
my gun too.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.531
- She say where she was going?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.533
- Back in the cave she said
she wanted William back.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.455
Now she's looking for Jennifer.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.542
- She needs Jennifer
to open the door.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.369
What if she already found her?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.796
That's probably why Jennifer's
not answering her phone.

10:32.883 --> 10:33.872
Damn it.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.343
- What about you?

10:35.427 --> 10:36.928
Back in the cave
you were bleeding.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.001
- It's nothing.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.880
We just need to get
back to the lighthouse

10:40.974 --> 10:43.226
before Mara makes Jennifer
open that door again.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.891
(grunts, metal clangs)

10:44.978 --> 10:45.967
let's go.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.978
Come on.

10:50.192 --> 10:53.059
(chatter)

10:53.153 --> 10:55.064
(police radio chatter)

10:55.155 --> 10:56.895
It's all gone.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.242
- The door self-destructed
after it blasted us out.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.996
- Lighthouse took
the brunt of the earthquake.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.119
Minimal damage to the town.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.450
- You seen Jennifer Mason?

11:09.545 --> 11:11.160
- I haven't seen her.

11:11.255 --> 11:12.711
- But?

11:12.798 --> 11:14.004
- I'll ask around.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.419
- This is impossible.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.967
The first time
the lighthouse collapsed,

11:19.054 --> 11:21.420
we rebuilt completely to
code for earthquakes.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.221
Then when it
was hit by the meteor,

11:23.308 --> 11:24.969
we double-reinforced
the new walls.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.596
- Yeah, well,
third times the charm, huh?

11:26.687 --> 11:27.927
- They'll never
get the town council

11:28.021 --> 11:29.477
to approve funding
to rebuild again.

11:29.565 --> 11:30.805
The insurance rates alone,

11:30.899 --> 11:32.105
and the liability.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.693
If anybody died in there,

11:33.777 --> 11:36.484
this whole damn town
is going to go bankrupt.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.939
(sighing)
- If he only knew.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.992
- When Mara realizes the door's
at the bottom of the ocean,

11:44.079 --> 11:45.285
what's her next move?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.532
- Get William back.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.409
But that's your problem.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.785
I'm going to find Jennifer.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.708
- Hey, what happened to her,

11:51.795 --> 11:53.001
in the cave?

11:53.797 --> 11:56.129
After she shut the door,
she collapsed.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.006
- I don't know;
she got dizzy.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.175
You try operating a supernatural door
to another dimension

12:00.262 --> 12:02.924
using a vampire novel
and a positive attitude.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.676
You know, when I do find her,

12:04.766 --> 12:06.802
we are gonna take
a very long trip

12:06.894 --> 12:08.725
and not send a postcard.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.222
- Let's go, people.

12:10.314 --> 12:13.147
We need to get search
and rescue divers down there

12:13.233 --> 12:15.940
before we lose all this debris
to the current.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.229
(screaming)

12:20.324 --> 12:21.564
(straining)

12:24.161 --> 12:25.150
E311]

12:25.245 --> 12:26.234
- My eyes.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.245
What's happened to my eyes?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.240
(grimacing)

12:33.545 --> 12:36.036
J‘J‘

12:41.345 --> 12:43.131
(chatter)

12:46.099 --> 12:47.088
- Thanks.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.261
- He isn't Troubled.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.559
Someone did this to him.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.684
- Mara said she was gonna
give people new Troubles.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.811
This is her way
of distracting us.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.392
- Mara can Trouble people?

12:58.528 --> 13:01.065
- If she's got William box
of black goo.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.316
- How do she and William know

13:02.407 --> 13:03.396
so much about
the Troubles anyway?

13:03.492 --> 13:04.857
(engine starts up)

13:04.952 --> 13:06.408
- They were in Haven before.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.077
- I got to put an APB out
on Mara,

13:09.164 --> 13:10.620
I'll talk to Vince about
getting the guard involved.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.119
- You go after Mara,
she's gonna fight back.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.451
- What, you're afraid about
civilians getting hurt?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.046
- Or someone gets trigger-happy.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.416
That's still Audrey's body.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.714
(sighs)
- Is it?

13:22.177 --> 13:24.008
I mean, we're gonna risk
all these people's lives,

13:24.096 --> 13:25.302
but what if...

13:25.806 --> 13:28.138
what if Audrey
isn't in there anymore?

13:29.101 --> 13:30.090
- She is.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.889
I'm gonna get her back.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.596
- Seem pretty sure about that.

13:35.691 --> 13:36.680
-lam.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.723
Just need some time.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.980
Duke: Well, forget it.
- Look, look... I know.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.063
- He's gonna be a mess
until we find Jennifer.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.482
- Back in the cave,

13:46.576 --> 13:48.612
I thought I heard duke say
she wasn't breathing.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.786
- He was in
pretty rough shape, too.

13:50.872 --> 13:51.861
Seems fine now.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.073
I don't know...
Maybe what happens in the cave

13:54.167 --> 13:55.668
stays in the cave?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.377
- Nobody's seen Jennifer.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.293
One of the firemen,
a half hour ago,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.841
he said he spoke... to Audrey.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.465
- Okay, how is Mara
pretending to be Audrey?

14:07.556 --> 14:09.547
- She has all of Audrey's
memories.

14:10.851 --> 14:11.840
- Ah, perfect.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.723
- Fireman also said
she was asking about Jennifer.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.602
I mean, if the door's gone...

14:19.693 --> 14:21.604
what does Mara
need Jennifer for?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.731
- Mara called it "that door."

14:23.822 --> 14:25.107
maybe there's more than one.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.735
Dwight: Multiple doors to...
hell?

14:27.826 --> 14:28.815
Even more perfect.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.152
- When Mara and William
came to Haven in the past,

14:32.247 --> 14:33.748
maybe they got here
some other way.

14:33.832 --> 14:34.821
- You think Jennifer might know?

14:34.916 --> 14:37.168
I mean, she led us to the
lighthouse in the first place.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.708
- Look, I'm gonna plot
where we all landed

14:38.795 --> 14:40.501
and try to figure out
where Jennifer might be.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.921
- I'm gonna need some manpower.
- I'll get some people on it.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.714
- We should talk
to Vince and Dave.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.587
If Dave really has traveled
through these doors,

14:46.678 --> 14:48.293
maybe he knows
something about it.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.347
Vince: After everything
we went through,

14:56.438 --> 14:58.804
and we lost Audrey after all.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.390
- No, I can turn her back.

15:02.486 --> 15:03.646
I just need to find Mara

15:03.737 --> 15:06.069
before Dwight gets the rest
of the department involved.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.989
- You haven't told Dwight
who Mara really is-- what she did?

15:09.076 --> 15:10.441
- No, there's too many
people who would love

15:10.535 --> 15:12.491
to get a hold of the person
who started the Troubles.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.115
I don't want to put Dwight
in that position.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.492
- Well, perhaps Mara
isn't as dangerous now

15:16.583 --> 15:18.198
with William gone and
the door destroyed.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.999
- That door.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.327
I'm afraid there
might be another.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.501
J‘J‘

15:22.589 --> 15:23.954
- What?

15:24.049 --> 15:25.038
- Did Dave ever tell you

15:25.133 --> 15:27.670
how he came from
wherever he came from?

15:27.761 --> 15:28.967
How he got back and forth?

15:29.054 --> 15:31.841
- Apparently Dave doesn't
tell me much at all.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.298
J‘J‘

15:34.392 --> 15:36.178
(sighs)
- What about Cabot's journal?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.435
The Mi'kmaq legends in it

15:38.522 --> 15:39.978
led us to the cave
under the lighthouse.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.680
Maybe it says something
about another door.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.140
(exasperated sigh)

15:43.235 --> 15:45.521
- I don't remember
anything else.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.852
I'd have to
go through it again.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.027
- Okay.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.400
Where is it?

15:49.491 --> 15:52.654
- Dave said it was stolen,
but I'm sure he hid it.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.788
- So we have to wait
for him to wake up?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.612
- No, no, no, I'll find it.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.742
I'm his brother.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.699
I know all his hiding places.

16:06.967 --> 16:07.956
(sighing)

16:08.844 --> 16:09.833
- Vince...

16:11.471 --> 16:12.460
you okay?

16:13.557 --> 16:14.592
- No.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.353
Dave.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.055
Can you hear me?

16:25.402 --> 16:28.314
(monitor beeping)

16:30.115 --> 16:33.107
(beeping continues)

16:36.454 --> 16:39.446
(beeping intensifies)

16:41.501 --> 16:44.413
J‘J‘

16:46.131 --> 16:47.120
- Chief.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.340
I heard you were
out at the lighthouse.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.167
Do you know what kind
of Trouble it was?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.176
- I'm sorry,
I can't talk about it.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.473
- I understand, but...

16:59.686 --> 17:01.017
people in the guard are scared,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.350
- His brother was just shot.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.397
- Just, when you get a chance,
talk to him.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.438
- Hey.
' Hey,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.110
I talked to
Bill Stevens' doctor.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.483
She said the leather sutures
around his eyes

17:12.574 --> 17:14.155
are surgically
impossible to remove.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.277
They can't get a knife
through them,

17:15.368 --> 17:16.357
any knife.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.114
- Okay, talk to Bill--
See if he remembers anything

17:18.205 --> 17:20.036
that can help us.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.488
I'm gonna head out
and look for Mara.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.707
- Mara's not behind
this Trouble.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.627
Whoever is, is more
dangerous than her right now.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.170
- No one's more dangerous
than Mara.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.246
- Nathan.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.258
Is there something
you're not telling me?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.592
- No.

17:41.728 --> 17:46.062
J‘J‘

17:52.739 --> 17:53.728
(sighs)

17:55.659 --> 17:58.321
- Come on, Jennifer,
where are you?

18:06.086 --> 18:07.667
- Excuse me.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.743
- Hey, Audrey.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.916
You want the usual?

18:11.007 --> 18:13.669
- Black, like drinking oil
out of a Styrofoam cup?

18:13.760 --> 18:14.920
(chuckles)
Sounds tempting.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.758
But I'm actually here
on police business.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.304
- Oh, really?
What's up?

18:20.392 --> 18:23.054
- I need to see
inside of your stockroom.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.550
- Why?

18:25.522 --> 18:26.807
- Do I need to come back
with a warrant?

18:29.192 --> 18:30.181
- Don't be ridiculous.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.767
It's right back here.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.018
I'll show you.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.437
(creaking)

18:40.370 --> 18:41.530
Here it is.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.157
Not much to see.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.371
Just restaurant stuff.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.998
J‘J‘

18:52.007 --> 18:53.543
So, uh, look, this isn't

18:53.633 --> 18:55.919
about that little incident
last year, is it?

18:56.011 --> 18:58.753
'cause, I mean,
it's legal now in Maine,

18:58.847 --> 19:00.963
you know, even without
a prescription.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.057
- Move this for me.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.185
Come on, let's see
those muscles.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.736
(clears throat)

19:13.820 --> 19:14.980
(scraping and rattling)

19:19.784 --> 19:20.773
- What are you looking at?

19:20.869 --> 19:22.234
I don't see anything.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.194
- You wouldn't know
what to look for.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.280
People rarely do.

19:31.838 --> 19:32.827
(lapping)

19:33.340 --> 19:34.830
- Audrey?

19:38.178 --> 19:39.213
(zapping)
- Ow.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.669
- What's up-- You okay?
- Shut up!

19:41.681 --> 19:42.921
(sighs)

19:43.016 --> 19:44.506
What's wrong with it?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.805
- Look, Audrey, I don't know
what you're talking about,

19:47.896 --> 19:50.854
but, like, what
are you trying to do?

19:52.192 --> 19:53.181
(sighs)

19:57.364 --> 19:58.854
- Never mind.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.237
Oh, you know what?
(snaps fingers)

20:04.329 --> 20:05.739
Give me your car keys.
(scoffs)

20:05.830 --> 20:07.616
Come on, let's have them.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.907
(sighs)

20:12.045 --> 20:13.910
- You know what,
you're acting really weird.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.245
Audrey, I'm gonna call Nathan.

20:15.965 --> 20:16.954
(gun fires)

20:25.934 --> 20:27.720
Uangﬂng)
- Stupid pot-head.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.224
J‘J‘

20:34.692 --> 20:37.729
J‘J‘

20:40.240 --> 20:41.446
(rustling)

20:49.624 --> 20:50.909
(cell phone ringing)

20:52.919 --> 20:54.955
(phone beeps)
- Carl, what you got?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.286
Carl: We've been putting
the word out about Jennifer

20:56.381 --> 20:58.372
like you asked.
No one's seen her.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.252
But I just got a call
from a buddy of mine.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.584
Fishing boat came across a bunch of
debris from the lighthouse.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.010
- What kind of debris?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.883
- They're still trying
to gather it up.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.089
No bodies yet, but--

21:07.183 --> 21:08.172
- Call me when
you got something.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.257
(phone beeps)

21:11.938 --> 21:14.145
- Okay, if we can't say the earthquake
brought down the lighthouse,

21:14.232 --> 21:15.688
we're gonna have to
come up with something.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.979
I don't know.
You're the engineer.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.152
(tires screeching, crashing)

21:28.496 --> 21:29.485
(thuds)

21:30.665 --> 21:31.654
(hissing)

21:34.627 --> 21:35.787
What the hell?

21:41.176 --> 21:42.712
(distant siren barks)

21:44.137 --> 21:45.126
(chatter)

21:54.564 --> 21:56.350
J‘J‘

21:56.441 --> 21:57.430
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.607
- Hey, hey, it's not her.

21:59.694 --> 22:00.900
It's not her.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.189
- On the map
I've been working on, it's--

22:04.240 --> 22:05.571
Jennifer could have
landed near here.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.649
- Sam was shot in the head.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.197
A tourist trying
to pick up a coffee

22:10.288 --> 22:11.824
said he saw a woman
leaving in his car.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.281
(sighs)
- Mara...

22:15.376 --> 22:17.241
- Luckily it wasn't someone
who recognized Audrey.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.669
We'd never be able
to keep this quiet.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.963
But why would Mara shoot Sam?

22:22.050 --> 22:23.665
- Maybe this means Mara
doesn't have Jennifer yet.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.749
(phone buzzing)

22:26.221 --> 22:27.210
- Wuornos.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.212
I'll be right there.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.263
(phone beeps)
Vince has Cabot's journal.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.511
Let's go.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.932
(birds chirping)

22:42.278 --> 22:43.267
(bell dings)

22:44.030 --> 22:45.019
Hey.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.523
- He hid it behind king tut.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.867
At least something about Dave
is predictable.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.036
Duke: Does it tell us anything?

22:54.123 --> 22:57.035
- About other doors?
- Ah, not a door.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.503
That's why I
didn't see it before.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.123
Cabot transcribed

23:01.214 --> 23:02.624
some of the oldest
Mi'kmaq legends

23:02.715 --> 23:04.626
in the original dialect.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.706
Very ancient.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.212
Would be impossible
for most people

23:07.303 --> 23:09.635
- to translate it into modern English.
- Vince.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.757
- Oh, of course.

23:11.766 --> 23:15.759
Anyway, the Mi'kmaq speak
of special places

23:15.853 --> 23:17.593
where the veil between worlds...

23:18.606 --> 23:19.812
is stretched thin.

23:20.942 --> 23:23.604
When one of these thin spots
is opened...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.690
travel between
worlds is possible.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.815
- Maybe that's what Mara
was doing at Sam's,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.992
trying to open
one of these thin spots.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.365
Vince: But what went wrong?
Why didn't she retrieve William?

23:35.456 --> 23:36.707
Duke: She can't do it by herself.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.871
She needs Jennifer
to open up the door,

23:40.962 --> 23:43.123
just like she did back
in the cave.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.499
- Oh.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.673
- How many of these thin spots
are there in Haven?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.260
- Well, the landscape
has changed quite a bit

23:48.344 --> 23:50.255
in the last 500 years.

23:50.346 --> 23:53.088
But the Mi'kmaq drew a map--
I made copies--

23:53.182 --> 23:56.891
that show where they
believe five thin spots to be.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.311
One of them coincides with
the black house coffee spot.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.983
Another with the lighthouse.

24:04.527 --> 24:05.516
Nathan: Leaves three.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.944
If Mara opens one,
we're in trouble.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.730
Duke and I will stake out two.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.610
I'll get Dwight on the other.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.282
If we're right,
maybe we can get ahead of her.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.358
- Yeah, if I find Mara first,

24:14.454 --> 24:17.742
she's gonna regret ever
having gone after Jennifer.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.827
J‘J‘

24:32.889 --> 24:33.878
(engine stops)

24:39.646 --> 24:41.182
(waves lapping)

24:44.442 --> 24:46.933
Nathan: It should be right here.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.312
The rock.

24:54.702 --> 24:55.942
Tide's too high.

24:58.414 --> 25:02.748
J‘J‘

25:11.511 --> 25:13.502
All right, Mara,
I'm ready for you.

25:18.393 --> 25:21.430
J‘J‘

25:23.773 --> 25:24.762
(rustling, sighing)

25:27.694 --> 25:28.683
(clicks)

25:41.165 --> 25:44.498
J‘J‘

26:00.560 --> 26:02.676
(gun fires)

26:10.403 --> 26:12.735
(ethereal rattling)

26:14.282 --> 26:15.271
(booming)

26:17.410 --> 26:18.399
(groaning)

26:20.413 --> 26:21.402
(laughs)

26:22.498 --> 26:24.830
- How much do I love your Trouble?

26:25.626 --> 26:28.038
Musket balls, bullets.

26:29.046 --> 26:32.584
I think one of your ancestors
actually took a cannonball...

26:33.468 --> 26:34.958
right in the chest.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.797
Ultimate cannon fodder, right?

26:37.889 --> 26:38.878
(chuckles)

26:40.683 --> 26:41.672
(Taser clicking)

26:41.768 --> 26:44.851
(grunting)

26:49.108 --> 26:50.097
(Taser clicking)

26:51.944 --> 26:53.445
(clicking ceases, exhausted breathing)

26:55.239 --> 26:58.902
J‘J‘

27:01.913 --> 27:02.902
(whooshing)

27:07.794 --> 27:09.000
(zapping, exasperated groaning)

27:10.463 --> 27:11.452
- Damn it.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.046
This one's sealed, too.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.379
Two thinnies sealed
is not an accident.

27:20.473 --> 27:21.633
Someone did this.

27:22.934 --> 27:23.923
Who?

27:25.228 --> 27:27.219
Which one of you
naughty little children

27:27.313 --> 27:29.645
figured out how to
seal a thinny?

27:29.732 --> 27:31.188
(gasps)

27:31.275 --> 27:32.435
Tell me,

27:32.527 --> 27:34.313
or you'll wish
I Tasered you again.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.395
- You sew me up,

27:37.490 --> 27:40.152
I won't be able
to tell you anything.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.525
- Sew you up?
What are you talking about?

27:42.620 --> 27:43.985
- The Trouble you gave.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.742
You've been sewing up
people's faces all day.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.447
- Not me.

27:48.543 --> 27:49.908
Nope.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.914
But I might be able
to work with that.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.415
- Why are you doing this?

27:54.507 --> 27:56.247
What do you want with us?

27:56.342 --> 27:57.331
- Aw.

27:58.511 --> 27:59.500
Poor, Dwight.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.303
Always so loyal,

28:03.349 --> 28:05.681
always trying
to do the right thing.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.344
And always the last to know.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.189
There's a lesson in that.

28:13.276 --> 28:15.608
I can't wait for you to learn.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.768
- What are you talking about?

28:27.373 --> 28:28.954
(waves lapping)

28:36.716 --> 28:37.705
(sighs)

28:44.849 --> 28:49.718
J‘J‘

28:53.774 --> 28:55.184
- You know
the skin on your lips

28:55.276 --> 28:57.312
is the most sensitive
on the entire body?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.485
- Okay, you're kind of starting
to weird me out.

28:59.572 --> 29:03.485
- Still getting used
to this whole feeling thing.

29:03.576 --> 29:04.565
- Yeah.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.740
- Back when you... kissed my cheek...

29:10.124 --> 29:11.159
that was the first time in years

29:11.250 --> 29:13.241
that I... felt
another person's touch.

29:14.879 --> 29:18.417
I hope you didn't feel
too weird about it.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.254
- Why would I feel weird?

29:22.553 --> 29:23.759
- Exactly.

29:25.723 --> 29:26.963
(cell phone ringing)

29:27.058 --> 29:28.047
(inhaling)

29:31.479 --> 29:32.468
- Wuornos.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.552
- It's me.

29:33.648 --> 29:34.637
- Dwight?
- Yeah.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.688
Backup phone.
Mara ambushed me.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.016
- You okay?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.646
- Yeah...
Took my Taser,

29:39.737 --> 29:41.443
and a fair bit of my pride.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.986
- You're lucky
she didn't kill you.

29:43.074 --> 29:45.440
- Yeah, I think she was having too
much fun electrocuting me.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.035
- Did she get
the thin spot opened?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.859
- No, but she called
it a thinny,

29:48.955 --> 29:50.741
couldn't get
through, said it was sealed.

29:50.831 --> 29:51.820
- Thank God.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.031
Was Jennifer with her?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.707
- No, I don't think Mara knows
where she is.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.205
But she thinks one of us

29:57.296 --> 29:59.002
is trying to keep
the thin spots sealed

29:59.090 --> 30:01.046
to keep her away from William.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.669
What if it is Jennifer?

30:02.760 --> 30:03.840
She's the only one
who could open and close

30:03.928 --> 30:05.213
the door in the cave.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.965
- She was the only one
who could open the door

30:07.056 --> 30:09.468
when we had to get Audrey
out of the barn.

30:09.558 --> 30:10.889
You might be on to something.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.387
- Okay, head out,
coordinate with Duke.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.467
Tell him your theory.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.551
- Can't do it.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.012
Mara's not behind
the sewing Trouble.

30:16.107 --> 30:17.722
- Mara is important, Dwight.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.603
- So is everybody else
in this town.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.685
I got to stop this
before somebody dies.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.986
- Dwight, just...

30:26.325 --> 30:27.986
be careful.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.318
(phones beep)

30:32.164 --> 30:33.153
(phone ringing)

30:33.666 --> 30:34.655
Nathan: Duke.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.251
Duke: Jennifer's a genius.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.375
She's been one step ahead
of Mara this whole time.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.451
- So why hasn't she called in

30:39.547 --> 30:41.879
and told us she's been
sealing the thin spots?

30:41.966 --> 30:44.082
- Mara has access
to all the same resources

30:44.176 --> 30:46.132
as officer Audrey Parker:

30:46.220 --> 30:47.756
police radio,
cell phone tracking.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.836
Jennifer can't take the chance

30:48.931 --> 30:50.216
that Mara would know
what she's up to.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.389
- Okay, Mara knows that
Dwight's location is sealed.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.639
That means she's on her way
to one of us.

30:55.730 --> 30:56.719
Be careful.

30:56.814 --> 30:57.803
She took down Dwight.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.980
- And I will never let him
hear the end of it.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.191
(waves lapping)

31:10.202 --> 31:13.535
J‘J‘

31:14.874 --> 31:16.159
(gasps)

31:17.251 --> 31:18.240
(sighs)

31:19.003 --> 31:20.618
If you have ever wondered

31:20.713 --> 31:23.455
who needs more sleep,
babies or old people,

31:23.549 --> 31:24.834
the answer's old people.

31:24.925 --> 31:25.914
- Sorry.

31:26.010 --> 31:26.999
I was going through
police archives.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.335
I found four cases in 1929,

31:29.430 --> 31:31.045
victims sewn up
just like we saw today.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.005
Only happened for a week,
and then suddenly stopped.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.089
- Mm-hmm.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.340
Intern?

31:36.270 --> 31:37.259
- Shh.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.389
Aaron's finally sleeping.

31:38.481 --> 31:40.221
- Ha-ha, lucky him.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.977
Okay, there you go.

31:42.068 --> 31:45.185
One victim, 1929,
suffocated to death.

31:45.279 --> 31:47.270
- I'm surprised the coroner's
office keeps files this old.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.025
- Oh, Lucassi saved them all.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.777
I heard he was working
on a screenplay.

31:52.244 --> 31:55.077
But if nobody's
been sewn up since 1929,

31:55.164 --> 31:57.826
why would the Trouble all of a
sudden come back today?

31:57.917 --> 32:00.408
- Won't know until
I find out whoever's doing this.

32:02.296 --> 32:03.877
(footsteps retreat)

32:03.964 --> 32:06.046
(splashing)

32:07.551 --> 32:11.385
- None so blind as those
who will not see.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.425
(grunting)

32:18.646 --> 32:19.635
(gasps)

32:19.730 --> 32:21.266
I know you felt that.

32:21.357 --> 32:24.520
And I bet I can
make you feel...

32:24.610 --> 32:25.850
this.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.114
J‘J‘

32:47.133 --> 32:49.340
- Guess I'm not the only one
having a bad day.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.798
- It's about
to get a lot better.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.887
- What makes you think that
one's gonna be open?

33:00.062 --> 33:02.769
Yeah, I know
about your thinnies.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.022
They're being sealed.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.187
- Do you know
how they're being sealed?

33:09.113 --> 33:11.320
- Why do you think I'm gonna
answer any of your questions?

33:14.034 --> 33:15.695
- Because I'm the one
with the gun.

33:19.832 --> 33:22.790
- That's the only thing
you can threaten me with.

33:22.877 --> 33:25.414
You didn't cause that
sewing Trouble.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.665
You haven't given anyone a
Trouble since you've been here.

33:27.756 --> 33:28.916
- Work now, fun later.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.498
- Sending us off
to stop a Trouble

33:30.593 --> 33:32.333
would have been
a great way of distracting us

33:32.428 --> 33:33.918
from coming after you.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.179
I don't think
you can do it.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.597
I think William's
box of black goo

33:38.684 --> 33:39.673
is still in that cave.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.554
- It's not goo.
It's Aether.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.019
- What?

33:44.106 --> 33:45.095
- Aether?

33:46.025 --> 33:48.061
It's the essence of the void.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.017
It holds everything together.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.613
Or pulls it apart.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.523
Depends on how you want
to use it, really.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.859
And I have plenty of it.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.238
- Then why haven't
you used it?

33:59.330 --> 34:02.288
- Because William hid it.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.036
That's why I
need to get him back.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.534
Unless...

34:09.298 --> 34:12.085
unless you want
to help me find it.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.713
I promise, I'll kill you last.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.544
- Really?
- Fine...

34:17.640 --> 34:19.130
I'll kill you first.

34:23.771 --> 34:24.806
- Audrey won't
let you hurt me.

34:24.897 --> 34:25.886
(waves crashing)

34:27.399 --> 34:29.139
I know she's still in there.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.521
- How many times
do I have to tell you?

34:31.612 --> 34:33.102
She's not.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.607
- Then when you came up
behind me,

34:34.698 --> 34:36.359
why didn't you just
shoot me in the back

34:36.450 --> 34:37.860
and get it over with?

34:41.497 --> 34:42.862
- When I get that thinny open,

34:42.957 --> 34:45.323
you're going to wish I had.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.578
J‘J‘

34:57.096 --> 34:58.085
- The dolls?

34:58.722 --> 35:00.053
Ugly as hell.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.472
But can't throw out
a family heirloom.

35:03.644 --> 35:05.225
- They're more than just dolls.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.143
The stitching's identical
to what's been happening

35:07.231 --> 35:09.222
to people all over town today.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.648
You know anything
about the Troubles, Henry?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.560
- My family doesn't have
anything to do with that.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.441
- You recognize these men?

35:20.536 --> 35:21.525
- No.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.953
I... I don't know either of them.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.285
What did this?

35:27.793 --> 35:31.035
- In 1929 four people were
sewn up just like these men.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.667
All four of them worked
for your family.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.372
- Someone in my family did this?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.968
woman: I'm sorry, Henry.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.590
I hoped you'd never
have to find out.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.881
Chief Erickson,
I'm Colette Barrow,

35:43.976 --> 35:44.965
Henry's mother.

35:45.102 --> 35:46.182
- Mom, why didn't you tell me?

35:46.270 --> 35:48.602
- Our Trouble hasn't been active
for generations.

35:50.399 --> 35:51.388
- Who was
the last person in your family

35:51.483 --> 35:52.643
to have the Trouble?

35:52.735 --> 35:54.600
- My great-grandmother,
Constance.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.395
But when she died,
the curse seemed to die with her.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.151
- HoW'd she die?

36:01.827 --> 36:04.034
- Official story
was that she tripped

36:04.121 --> 36:05.531
and fell down the stairs,

36:05.622 --> 36:06.611
broke her neck.

36:06.707 --> 36:07.696
- And the unofficial story?

36:07.791 --> 36:08.997
- Far more scandalous.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.000
Apparently Constance
had brought a man home.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.711
A tenant farmer.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.585
No one could imagine
how the two had met.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.338
Some believed
he pushed her down the stairs.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.420
- Why wasn't he prosecuted?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.596
- A trial would have
meant publicity.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.925
My family swept
it all under the rug.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.432
And after that night,

36:30.522 --> 36:32.387
the monkeys never sewed again.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.523
Dwight: So why are they sewing now?

36:42.743 --> 36:44.449
Duke: Check it out.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.652
The "x"s mark every place
I've looked for Jennifer,

36:46.747 --> 36:48.453
and there's an
overlap at the lighthouse, too,

36:48.540 --> 36:49.529
where Mara first caused
the sewing Trouble.

36:49.625 --> 36:50.785
- Now, if we can figure out--
- Dude, dude,

36:50.876 --> 36:52.616
Mara didn't cause
the sewing Trouble.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.123
It belongs to the Barrow family.

36:55.214 --> 36:56.249
- Are you sure?

36:56.340 --> 36:58.626
- Yeah, hadn't
been activated since 1929

36:58.717 --> 37:00.924
when Constance Barrow
was murdered.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.000
I checked.

37:02.096 --> 37:03.927
Your grandfather
was the prime suspect.

37:04.014 --> 37:05.003
(gasps)

37:06.141 --> 37:07.130
- No, but if he killed her,

37:07.226 --> 37:09.467
the... the Barrow Trouble
should be gone,

37:09.561 --> 37:10.846
eradicated from
the family line forever.

37:10.938 --> 37:13.224
- So why is it back?

37:13.315 --> 37:14.475
The first victim
was at the lighthouse.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.022
Over here is where
Carl McDonald

37:16.110 --> 37:17.475
drove his truck off the road.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.558
- Carl?

37:19.154 --> 37:21.065
I just spoke to him.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.153
Oh, my god.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.031
- What-- wh-what are you thinking?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.120
- The Barrow Trouble.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.374
What if it's me?

37:35.629 --> 37:36.664
What if I'm the one
causing it?

37:36.755 --> 37:37.744
- You're causing
the Barrow Trouble?

37:37.840 --> 37:38.829
How?

37:38.924 --> 37:39.913
- My blood.

37:40.801 --> 37:43.634
All the Troubles
my family ever wiped out.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.631
In the cave William said
that they're all in me now.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.303
- So when you killed the grass,

37:47.391 --> 37:49.052
you think that was a Trouble?

37:49.143 --> 37:52.306
- I don't know which one,
but yeah, must have been.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.727
- Yeah, but you're not
bleeding now, okay,

37:53.814 --> 37:55.725
so why are people
still being sewn up?

37:55.816 --> 37:57.352
- l was still bleeding when
I got thrown out of the cave.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.523
It must be enough.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.601
- How many Troubles
do you have inside you?

38:02.698 --> 38:04.563
- Crockers have been killing
for a long time.

38:05.367 --> 38:06.447
J‘J‘

38:09.288 --> 38:10.448
Dwight: Okay, so what
you're telling me

38:10.539 --> 38:12.075
is that you have
hundreds of Troubles

38:12.166 --> 38:14.532
and any one of those could
just pop up at any time?

38:14.626 --> 38:15.706
- How--
Duke: I don't know, Dwight.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.376
Look, we just have
to find Mara.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.624
She created the Troubles.

38:19.715 --> 38:20.750
She's got to know
how to end them.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.010
- Mara created the Troubles?

38:26.597 --> 38:27.677
- Yeah, I thought you knew.

38:29.933 --> 38:33.391
I just figured Vince
or Nathan would have told you.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.390
- No, they didn't.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.388
(chatter)

38:38.484 --> 38:40.224
(P.A. making announcements)

38:40.319 --> 38:41.559
- Can I wake him?

38:41.653 --> 38:42.813
- Good luck, darling.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.988
He's been all over
that morphine button.

38:47.743 --> 38:48.903
(monitor beeping)

38:51.830 --> 38:56.244
J‘J‘

39:07.095 --> 39:08.084
- What are you?

39:08.180 --> 39:09.670
Nathan: Don't do this.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.799
(men shouting)

39:14.978 --> 39:17.390
(monitor beeping, Dave mumbling)

39:22.319 --> 39:26.358
J‘J‘

39:33.455 --> 39:34.444
(zapping, gasps)

39:34.540 --> 39:35.529
(lapping)

39:45.384 --> 39:46.373
(groaning)

39:48.595 --> 39:50.426
- You're trapped here.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.506
I guess Jennifer is more
powerful than you thought.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.974
- Jennifer?

39:56.061 --> 39:57.050
Oh, please.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.180
(laughs)

39:58.272 --> 40:00.934
She doesn't have
the power to do this.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.561
- I don't believe you.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.188
- It's not a lie
worth telling.

40:05.279 --> 40:06.815
- Then why were you
looking for her?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.987
- She's a conduit
between worlds.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.689
I can use her
to send a message,

40:10.784 --> 40:13.571
tell William which thinnies
I've opened.

40:13.662 --> 40:14.868
She's a convenience.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.155
I've got another one
I need to try.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.332
Let's go, Mr. Hostage.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.955
- That one's not
gonna be open either.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.331
J‘J‘

40:24.423 --> 40:26.755
You can't get William back.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.083
But I will get Audrey back.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.260
(chucang)
- Jeez Louise.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.680
You just don't get it, do you?

40:35.934 --> 40:39.552
What do I have to do
to prove to you Audrey's gone?

40:39.646 --> 40:41.432
- There's nothing you can do.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.682
She is still in there,

40:44.776 --> 40:45.856
and she loves me.

40:45.944 --> 40:46.933
(scoffs)

40:47.195 --> 40:49.527
Our love is stronger
than anything

40:49.615 --> 40:51.446
that you and William could ever--

40:51.533 --> 40:52.693
(gun fires)

40:52.784 --> 40:53.773
(thuds)

40:55.078 --> 40:56.067
(groans)

41:00.375 --> 41:03.708
J‘J‘

41:13.805 --> 41:16.467
I'll always love you, Parker.

41:19.478 --> 41:23.187
J‘J‘

41:31.365 --> 41:35.654
J‘J‘

41:48.715 --> 41:52.333
J‘J‘
