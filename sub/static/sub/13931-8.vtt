00:03.149 --> 00:04.810
Carolina Maria Diaz,

00:05.068 --> 00:07.546
If you wish to communicate
with us, give us a sign.

00:09.029 --> 00:09.943
Amy!

00:09.994 --> 00:11.919
What happened to me?
We woke something up.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.589
I spent my life
trusting the wrong people.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.289
You're scared of Deb
finding out about your D.U.I.?

00:16.340 --> 00:18.816
Camp was the only place
where I could be myself.

00:18.867 --> 00:20.840
Holyoke.
He's been dead for a century.

00:20.891 --> 00:22.219
If you followed
the trail this far,

00:22.270 --> 00:23.212
You've come to understand

00:23.263 --> 00:24.789
The same things about
that place as I did."

00:24.840 --> 00:25.802
Help me!

00:25.853 --> 00:27.706
It's okay. They can't
hurt you anymore.

00:27.757 --> 00:30.068
You killed him
and Dave and cricket.

00:30.119 --> 00:31.395
We had nothing
to do with them.

00:31.446 --> 00:33.886
You're lying to me.
Just like you lied to Damon.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.171
What makes me
the ideal ... applicant?

01:01.178 --> 01:02.661
Be yourself.

Excuse me.

01:24.408 --> 01:25.862
Mom!

01:25.892 --> 01:27.034
You're smoking?

01:27.064 --> 01:28.438
Jessie!

01:28.468 --> 01:30.356
Man, this must be
some strong-ass weed,

01:30.386 --> 01:32.564
'cause I swear I heard
that girl call you "Mom."

01:32.594 --> 01:34.860
They think we're sisters.

01:35.017 --> 01:36.695
Mom, who is that?

01:36.725 --> 01:38.408
I told you about Carl.

01:38.438 --> 01:40.198
You didn't tell me he was
bringing weed to the house.

01:40.228 --> 01:41.691
Does he know you did time
for possession?

01:41.721 --> 01:43.695
Calm down, baby.
This one's different.

01:43.725 --> 01:45.162
They always are.

02:00.365 --> 02:01.513
I wish you told me

02:01.543 --> 02:03.399
Half the building
was coming over tonight.

02:03.429 --> 02:04.716
Do you not remember
I have

02:04.746 --> 02:06.151
My North-Western interview
in two days?

02:06.181 --> 02:09.610
Of course I remember, baby.
I just...

02:09.738 --> 02:12.643
I wasn't thinking,
I guess.

02:16.645 --> 02:18.169
I'm proud of you.

02:18.794 --> 02:20.289
The way you've been
working so hard

02:20.319 --> 02:22.628
And how you're not letting
nothing get in your way.

02:22.658 --> 02:24.132
I wish I had been
more like that.

02:24.162 --> 02:26.426
Well, you had a lot
on your plate.

02:26.456 --> 02:29.110
Well, I sure as hell wasn't
getting into North-Western.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.191
Well, neither will I unless
I ace this interview.

02:31.221 --> 02:33.190
You will.
I know you will.

02:34.569 --> 02:37.626
But tonight,
can't you just relax?

02:37.656 --> 02:39.464
Or you're gonna burn out.

02:39.886 --> 02:41.189
I don't know, mom.

02:41.219 --> 02:43.644
Have I ever
steered you wrong?

02:43.712 --> 02:46.311
Hmm? I'm always looking out
for what's best for you.

02:46.341 --> 02:47.739
You know that.

02:48.837 --> 02:50.248
Now come on.

02:50.525 --> 02:52.300
Let's have some fun.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.715
Just you and me.
Come on.

02:56.691 --> 02:58.804
All r-i-i-ight.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.728
That's my baby girl.

03:01.487 --> 03:03.017
Now, I'm worried
about you, jessie.

03:03.047 --> 03:04.868
You haven't
been taking my calls.

03:04.980 --> 03:05.938
I've been busy.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.513
Well, you got that
court date coming up.

03:07.543 --> 03:09.188
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

03:09.218 --> 03:10.722
I'm fine, mom.

03:10.752 --> 03:13.066
You know i'm just
looking out for you.

03:13.404 --> 03:15.754
What happened
to my sweet baby girl?

03:15.784 --> 03:17.094
Hey.

03:17.124 --> 03:18.846
Deb wants to talk to us.

03:18.876 --> 03:20.612
Okay, just a sec.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.479
I got to go, mom.

03:24.715 --> 03:26.882
Hi, Amy, Jessie, welcome.

03:26.912 --> 03:28.243
Okay.

03:28.273 --> 03:30.465
I just got off the phone
with the state police.

03:30.495 --> 03:32.121
State police?
What about Garrett?

03:32.151 --> 03:34.025
Deputy sykes
is under investigation

03:34.055 --> 03:36.251
But only until
they have finished the report

03:36.281 --> 03:38.168
About what happened here.

03:38.198 --> 03:40.512
What they have
determined for sure...

03:40.542 --> 03:42.544
Is that stillwater sucks
at vetting sheriffs?

03:42.574 --> 03:46.681
...Is that everyone involved
in the terrible things

03:46.711 --> 03:49.714
That happened here
is dead.

03:50.042 --> 03:52.380
It's over.

03:52.410 --> 03:54.665
We don't have to be
afraid anymore.

03:54.695 --> 03:56.226
It's because of you.

03:56.315 --> 03:58.038
Sykes never would have
busted those guys

03:58.068 --> 03:59.573
If you hadn't
drawn them out.

03:59.603 --> 04:00.722
He's right.

04:00.752 --> 04:03.802
The way that you all
have come together,

04:03.832 --> 04:07.746
The way that you have
become a family,

04:07.776 --> 04:09.902
In spite of everything,

04:09.932 --> 04:12.220
It's been incredible
to watch.

04:12.598 --> 04:16.523
Which makes it even harder
to say goodbye.

04:17.517 --> 04:18.926
What are you
talking about?

04:18.956 --> 04:21.124
I'm shutting camp down.
What?

04:21.154 --> 04:24.741
The, um, authorities
have given me 48 hours

04:24.771 --> 04:26.670
Before they release the story
to the media.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.480
After that, the camp will be
filled with cops and reporters.

04:30.510 --> 04:34.128
You won't even
recognize this place,

04:34.158 --> 04:36.537
And I want to protect the kids
from that.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.242
The bus will take a day
to get here,

04:39.272 --> 04:42.826
So we have 24 hours
to get the kids ready

04:42.856 --> 04:45.849
And packed up to go home.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.915
I wanted to give you
the best summer ever.

04:50.945 --> 04:52.630
I -- I'm so sorry.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.558
Wait.
We can't leave like this.

04:56.588 --> 05:00.648
If this has to be our last day,
it deserve to be special.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.446
We owe it to the kids.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.009
And we owe it
to each other.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.833
It's pretty cool,
Huh?

05:14.868 --> 05:17.516
How quickly a place
can feel like home.

05:17.546 --> 05:19.337
It's amazing.
Yeah.

05:20.897 --> 05:22.547
I know that we kind of
started off

05:22.577 --> 05:24.569
On the wrong foot
this summer, but...

05:25.229 --> 05:29.108
I just wanted to say
thank you...for saving my life.

05:31.023 --> 05:32.505
You're welcome.

05:33.086 --> 05:35.821
But Garrett
really deserves the credit,

05:35.851 --> 05:37.682
On the life-saving front.

05:38.392 --> 05:40.631
You really care about him,
don't you?

05:41.673 --> 05:44.232
You know, you should
do something about it,

05:44.262 --> 05:46.077
While there's still time.

05:46.996 --> 05:48.429
Hey, guys!

06:30.554 --> 06:32.179
Do not turn around.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.991
No matter
what you hear or feel.

06:38.803 --> 06:40.244
Look at me.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.801
Jessie, listen to me.

06:46.831 --> 06:49.419
It's not over.
It's awakening.

06:49.682 --> 06:52.166
You have to put
Holyoke's bones in the lake,

06:52.196 --> 06:54.198
Or everyone will die.
Holyoke's bones?!

06:54.228 --> 06:57.417
Do it before sundown,
or it'll be too late.

06:57.469 --> 06:58.976
They'll try and convince you
it's a trick.

06:59.006 --> 07:00.432
Don't listen to them.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.268
Only trust yourself.

07:02.514 --> 07:04.692
Only you can do this,
Jessie.

07:05.789 --> 07:07.608
It's the only way
to end this.

07:10.224 --> 07:11.491
Wait. Why me?!

07:11.521 --> 07:12.713
Cricket?!

07:12.743 --> 07:14.154
Cricket!

07:28.180 --> 07:29.152
Did you see...?

07:29.182 --> 07:30.654
That was nuts!

07:31.110 --> 07:32.933
How did we not know that
there was an eclipse coming?

07:32.963 --> 07:34.973
It was so beautiful.

07:35.003 --> 07:37.992
It's like stillwater's
saying goodbye.

07:43.053 --> 07:46.425
Hey! we are gonna play one of our favourite games ...

07:46.455 --> 07:48.956
Blind man's bluff.
-Yes!

07:50.296 --> 07:52.416
And Jessie's up first.

07:52.446 --> 07:54.320
All right, ready?

07:54.350 --> 07:57.972
One , Two , Three .

07:58.002 --> 07:59.740
Hide. Hide, hide.
Okay.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.137
And -- wait, wait, wait!

08:01.167 --> 08:01.999
Forward.

08:02.029 --> 08:03.924
Forward, forward, forward,
forward, forward!

08:04.727 --> 08:06.884
And forward!
Ooh! So close.

08:06.914 --> 08:08.785
To your left.

08:29.393 --> 08:31.108
Jessie, Jessie.

08:31.138 --> 08:32.870
Jessie, what is it?

08:34.340 --> 08:37.006
You've been acting different
ever since the eclipse.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.453
Whatever is going on,
you can tell me.

08:40.484 --> 08:42.448
You can trust me,Jessie.

08:46.433 --> 08:47.965
I saw something.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.419
Something?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.433
Cricket.
She talked to me.

08:57.463 --> 09:00.565
She said the cops are wrong
and it's not over.

09:02.431 --> 09:04.472
What else did she say?

09:07.384 --> 09:10.810
She told me I have to put
Holyoke's bones in the lake.

09:11.323 --> 09:12.739
And that
if i didn't do it...

09:16.773 --> 09:18.708
...everyone
was going to die.

09:19.587 --> 09:21.723
That doesn't sound
like cricket.

09:22.316 --> 09:25.298
It sounds like Holyoke
trying to trick you.

09:25.328 --> 09:28.933
If cricket was going
to contact someone,

09:29.463 --> 09:32.061
Don't you think she would
have contacted Blair?

09:32.091 --> 09:33.424
He was her best friend.

09:33.454 --> 09:35.282
It really felt
like her, Amy.

09:35.312 --> 09:36.445
I'm sure it did.

09:36.475 --> 09:40.185
But if there's one thing
this place has taught me,

09:40.697 --> 09:44.288
It's that the only people
we can trust are each other.

09:49.576 --> 09:51.953
"North-Western has
an unparalleled faculty

09:51.983 --> 09:54.365
And a creative,
passionate student body.

09:54.395 --> 09:57.223
That's why I think your campus
is the perfect place for me

09:57.253 --> 09:59.948
To explore
my academic interests."

10:00.601 --> 10:02.405
Hey, college girl.

10:02.588 --> 10:04.361
I got you a present.

10:05.695 --> 10:06.970
Wow, mom. That's --

10:07.000 --> 10:08.872
I got it for
your big day tomorrow.

10:08.902 --> 10:11.480
You know, 'cause I figured,
if it looks good on me,

10:11.510 --> 10:13.083
It'll look even better
on you.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.176
A little revealing
for an interview,

10:15.206 --> 10:16.050
Don't you think?

10:16.080 --> 10:18.777
Nothing wrong with revealing
if you got something to reveal.

10:18.807 --> 10:21.435
I don't think that's on their admissions
check list, mom.

10:21.465 --> 10:24.785
Well, every little bit helps.
Trust me on that.

10:25.522 --> 10:27.726
Thanks.
I love it.

10:28.084 --> 10:29.642
But i got to go to work.

10:30.537 --> 10:32.088
Don't forget you're
driving me in the morning.

10:32.118 --> 10:33.880
We have to leave by 8:30
at the latest.

10:33.910 --> 10:34.964
Do you really think
I'd forget

10:34.994 --> 10:37.597
On the biggest day
of my baby's life?

10:40.344 --> 10:41.761
I love you, mom.

10:42.779 --> 10:44.295
Will you hang the dress up
in my closet?

10:44.325 --> 10:46.602
Actually, uh, do you mind
if I wear it tonight?

10:46.632 --> 10:48.542
'cause Carl's taking me out.

10:48.685 --> 10:50.255
Ugh.
Carl. Really?

10:50.285 --> 10:52.239
Yeah. Look, I know
he's not perfect,

10:52.269 --> 10:54.539
But I don't want to be by myself
when you go off to college.

10:54.569 --> 10:55.564
Mom, it's evanston.

10:55.594 --> 10:56.596
It's not like
i'm moving to paris.

10:56.626 --> 10:59.306
I know. I'm just gonna miss you.
That's all.

10:59.721 --> 11:01.247
I won't be far.

11:01.864 --> 11:03.608
See you at 8:30?
I'll see you at 8:00.

11:03.638 --> 11:05.522
We can pick up some
breakfast on the drive over.

11:05.552 --> 11:06.870
You don't have to do that.
But i want to.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.223
Don't I always
take care of my baby?

11:09.454 --> 11:10.862
Yes.

11:11.190 --> 11:12.135
Okay.

11:12.165 --> 11:13.525
See you tomorrow.

11:25.925 --> 11:27.635
There she is.

11:28.316 --> 11:30.622
That was quite the speech
you gave before.

11:31.121 --> 11:32.536
Thanks.

11:33.300 --> 11:36.361
Look, when you first
came here, I told you

11:36.391 --> 11:39.089
That i'd show you around,
and the offer still stands.

11:39.119 --> 11:40.554
You know, if there's
anything that you want

11:40.584 --> 11:43.003
To squeeze in before...
You know...

11:43.033 --> 11:45.053
All your memories here
don't have to be bad.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.795
Thanks, alex.

11:47.036 --> 11:48.793
Oh! ... Oh!

11:48.823 --> 11:50.230
I got it!

11:50.322 --> 11:51.740
Sorry!

11:52.872 --> 11:54.272
Joel...

11:54.728 --> 11:56.353
We need to talk.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.471
About what?

11:57.501 --> 11:58.741
Jessie.

11:58.872 --> 12:01.311
I think Holyoke
is trying to trick her.

12:01.341 --> 12:03.299
Same way he did you.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.222
Yeah, I knew
this wasn't over.

12:05.252 --> 12:07.255
We need to look
after her.

12:07.285 --> 12:09.450
Make sure she knows
who she can trust

12:09.480 --> 12:11.663
Before she does something
she regrets.

12:16.258 --> 12:17.266
Are you okay?

12:17.296 --> 12:19.227
Deb said you were
under investigation.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.175
Just until i'm cleared.

12:21.205 --> 12:22.467
Of what?

12:22.497 --> 12:24.327
Heelan.
But --

12:24.357 --> 12:26.680
Killing him was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

12:27.066 --> 12:30.983
Even after everything
he did, I still...

12:32.799 --> 12:36.199
And the worst part is,
before I shot him,

12:36.290 --> 12:38.306
He told me
they didn't kill Dave.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.842
Or Cricket.

12:40.448 --> 12:41.479
He told me
it was someone else.

12:41.509 --> 12:43.020
He was trying
to get in your head.

12:43.050 --> 12:44.789
Yeah, well, it worked.

12:44.939 --> 12:47.249
And the only reason
why I pulled that trigger?

12:48.262 --> 12:50.249
Because I thought
that would be the end.

12:51.339 --> 12:52.986
But now I know it isn't.

12:53.653 --> 12:55.175
Why do you say that?

12:56.527 --> 12:58.114
You saw the eclipse,
right?

12:58.144 --> 12:59.104
Yeah.

12:59.134 --> 13:01.248
There wasn't supposed
to be one today.

13:01.278 --> 13:03.961
And according to my dad's notes,
that's a sign.

13:03.991 --> 13:04.836
Of what?

13:04.866 --> 13:07.336
That a demon
has been awoken.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.307
Inside a vessel.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.036
A vessel?

13:11.066 --> 13:12.466
Amy.

13:12.904 --> 13:14.542
The ritual they were doing
in that cave --

13:14.572 --> 13:15.956
I think I was too late
to stop it.

13:15.986 --> 13:17.051
You mean Amy
is possessed.

13:17.081 --> 13:18.385
Look, i know it sounds
all crazy,

13:18.415 --> 13:20.760
But there's something
bigger at play here.

13:20.790 --> 13:22.601
If the eclipse happens,
something terrible --

13:22.631 --> 13:24.579
Truly terrible --
is on the horizon.

13:24.609 --> 13:26.459
And there's only one way
to stop it.

13:28.262 --> 13:30.005
It's by killing
the vessel.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.571
I hope you're not saying
what i think you're saying.

13:31.601 --> 13:33.155
Look, all I have to go on
is what my dad wrote

13:33.185 --> 13:35.772
In his journal, and so far,
he hasn't been wrong --

13:35.802 --> 13:37.187
About anything.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.905
So, no, I'm not
seriously standing here

13:38.935 --> 13:41.469
Telling you I want to kill Amy,
but I do want to end this.

13:41.499 --> 13:42.926
And right now...

13:43.753 --> 13:45.440
I don't know
any other way.

14:42.737 --> 14:45.532
I am so, so sorry.
My ride was late.

14:45.562 --> 14:47.173
And I know that
that's my responsibility --

14:47.203 --> 14:49.660
I'm sorry, too, Miss Tyler,
but you're almost an hour late.

14:49.690 --> 14:50.577
I have to go.

14:50.607 --> 14:53.598
No, please, sir,
just give me 10 minutes.

14:57.419 --> 14:59.292
So, you're saying
you want to steal the bones

14:59.322 --> 15:01.080
Of a man who's been dead
over a century,

15:01.110 --> 15:03.619
Dump them in the lake,
and that will end all this?

15:03.649 --> 15:06.339
Yes.
You've got to trust me.

15:09.092 --> 15:10.756
The state police said
they found a skeleton

15:10.786 --> 15:11.970
In the trunk of Damon's car.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.911
It matches to the skull
we dug up.

15:13.941 --> 15:15.093
They used it
as part of their ritual.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.320
They dug him up.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.865
We have to bury him
and end this.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.770
What brings you
to camp, deputy?

15:24.593 --> 15:27.511
I was just...
Checking in.

15:28.139 --> 15:30.189
Wanted to make sure
amy was okay.

15:30.332 --> 15:32.792
She's, um...Fine.

15:32.822 --> 15:36.115
Pretty incredible
under the circumstances.

15:36.145 --> 15:38.662
That's --
that's terrific.

15:38.692 --> 15:40.103
Yeah.

15:43.206 --> 15:45.378
Are you sure that
everything's all right?

15:45.842 --> 15:48.792
Like i said,
just checking in.

15:51.053 --> 15:52.720
This eclipse...

15:53.412 --> 15:54.994
There was, uh...

15:56.145 --> 15:57.783
One back in 1970.

15:57.813 --> 16:00.937
I completely forgot
until today.

16:01.431 --> 16:03.619
It's all got me
a bit uneasy.

16:08.336 --> 16:10.543
Let me know if there's
anything I can do.

16:11.691 --> 16:13.127
Thank you.

16:16.201 --> 16:17.632
We need to act now.

16:17.662 --> 16:19.040
The sun's gonna be down
in a few hours --

16:19.070 --> 16:21.796
There's no way the state police
are letting me in the morgue.

16:22.244 --> 16:24.575
So create a diversion,
and I'll go.

16:25.594 --> 16:27.314
Just like old times.

16:45.475 --> 16:47.727
Joel, what are you doing
down here, man?

16:47.757 --> 16:48.899
I've been looking
all over for you.

16:48.929 --> 16:49.780
What's going on?

16:49.810 --> 16:51.131
What's going on?

16:51.161 --> 16:53.071
Hey, get out
of my way, man.

16:53.627 --> 16:54.916
It's Holyoke!

16:54.946 --> 16:56.687
He contacted Jessie.
He's still out there.

16:56.717 --> 16:57.897
Yeah, and we're
leaving camp tomorrow.

16:57.927 --> 16:59.290
You think
that'll stop him?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.267
He followed
my brother home.

17:01.489 --> 17:04.599
He will never leave us alone
until I end this.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.323
How are you gonna
do that?

17:06.974 --> 17:08.262
By burning down the cabin.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.733
Hey!

17:09.775 --> 17:12.090
Holyoke is already dead,
remember?

17:12.121 --> 17:13.946
What the hell is burning down
a cabin gonna do?

17:13.977 --> 17:16.027
That's where he first appeared
to all of us.

17:16.057 --> 17:17.873
That's where he was
at his strongest.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.393
Maybe the cabin is like a portal
or a bridge to this world.

17:20.423 --> 17:21.681
Joel...

17:22.965 --> 17:24.825
You're talking crazy, man.

17:26.771 --> 17:28.353
You don't have to help me.

17:29.272 --> 17:31.289
Just stay the hell
out of my way.

17:47.919 --> 17:51.080
You got something to say,
say it to me!

19:06.618 --> 19:08.466
come on, jessie. Focus.

20:00.743 --> 20:02.608
You can't
stop what's coming.

20:02.638 --> 20:04.346
<i>They'll try to trick you.</i>

20:04.376 --> 20:05.382
i'm just looking out

20:05.412 --> 20:07.020
For what's best for you,
baby.

20:07.077 --> 20:09.702
<i>Don't listen, Jessie.</i>
<i>Trust yourself.</i>

20:10.415 --> 20:12.458
that changes nothing.

20:27.446 --> 20:30.143
Jessie, Amy told me
what you're gonna do.

20:30.173 --> 20:31.578
Don't do it.
Joel, you have no idea --

20:31.683 --> 20:34.135
Can't you tell
Holyoke's messing with you?

20:37.415 --> 20:40.281
If you do what he says,
you're going to help him

20:40.311 --> 20:42.125
Resurrect the thing
you think you're stopping.

20:42.155 --> 20:42.874
What are you talking about?

20:42.904 --> 20:44.163
The demon.

20:44.193 --> 20:45.964
Its name is Malphas.

20:48.721 --> 20:50.166
"He is the great
prince of hell.

20:50.196 --> 20:52.238
He will fool you
with good familiar spirits

20:52.366 --> 20:53.280
And use them
to betray you."

20:53.310 --> 20:55.817
Heelan, Damon --
they failed.

20:55.847 --> 20:57.380
But that demon
still wants to come back.

20:57.410 --> 21:00.281
And Holyoke will do anything in
his power to help awaken it.

21:00.323 --> 21:01.857
That's just it.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.941
I think that Malphas
may have already awoken.

21:05.909 --> 21:07.358
In a vessel.

21:07.846 --> 21:09.264
What vessel?

21:09.388 --> 21:14.002
Back in the olden days,
there was a large rock.

21:14.032 --> 21:16.707
I know it sounds insane, Joel,
but everything I've learned

21:16.737 --> 21:18.361
From these notes so far
has been true.

21:18.391 --> 21:20.728
No. You can't just say something
like that without proof.

21:20.758 --> 21:22.674
The eclipse
was the proof.

21:22.737 --> 21:25.618
It's not like there's a test
to prove if someone's a demon.

21:26.126 --> 21:29.308
Actually,
take a look at this.

21:33.027 --> 21:34.913
"A demon must respond
to its true name.

21:34.943 --> 21:36.485
When presented with
holy symbols,

21:36.515 --> 21:37.967
It will cause them pain."

21:38.608 --> 21:39.605
Where'd you even
get this book?

21:39.635 --> 21:40.590
It's a long story.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.094
We have to do this.

21:42.513 --> 21:45.468
If Amy is possessed, then this
is how we'll know you're right.

21:45.498 --> 21:48.377
But we have to do it now,
before sundown.

21:51.162 --> 21:54.336
What's wrong, guys?
Why all the secrecy?

21:54.366 --> 21:55.931
We just want to
talk to you, amy.

21:55.961 --> 21:57.575
Make sure
you're feeling okay.

21:57.605 --> 21:59.255
Last night was...

21:59.485 --> 22:00.827
It was pretty traumatic.

22:00.857 --> 22:02.391
It was.

22:03.387 --> 22:04.789
But i'm fine now.

22:04.819 --> 22:07.450
Good.
That's good.

22:10.219 --> 22:12.578
Amy, I need
to ask you something.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.304
When you were
in that cave...

22:17.378 --> 22:21.208
Did you hear anyone
say the word "Malphas?"

22:21.519 --> 22:23.012
What did you say?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.873
Malphas...

22:27.208 --> 22:30.205
Is the name of the demon those
psychos were trying to raise.

22:31.352 --> 22:34.209
No, I --
I didn't hear it.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.866
The last thing you need is
to reopen old wounds.

22:39.098 --> 22:41.079
Which is why I think
you should have this.

22:45.588 --> 22:47.155
Why are you
giving that to me?

22:47.185 --> 22:48.281
It was my mom's.

22:48.311 --> 22:50.688
She gave it to me
to wear for protection.

22:50.718 --> 22:52.740
I just think you need it
more than me.

22:52.770 --> 22:55.000
I -- I really
can't take that.

22:55.030 --> 22:56.445
We insist.

23:09.842 --> 23:11.331
Thank you.

23:15.234 --> 23:17.294
A demon test?
Are you serious?

23:17.324 --> 23:19.455
Garrett, what is
he talking about?

23:19.485 --> 23:21.230
I told you
to stay out of it.

23:21.382 --> 23:23.977
They think you're possessed,
and they're testing you.

23:24.007 --> 23:25.445
What?

23:26.072 --> 23:29.535
That isn't true,
right, Garrett?

23:29.837 --> 23:31.247
Jessie?

23:31.383 --> 23:33.421
Especially after everything
that she's been through.

23:33.451 --> 23:35.570
I trusted you guys.

23:46.544 --> 23:47.728
We were wrong.

23:47.758 --> 23:49.972
It's not in Amy.
This is all a trick.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.387
That's what it
wants you to think.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.896
You have to trust yourself.

23:55.117 --> 23:56.034
You're the trick.

23:56.064 --> 23:58.965
No,
you have to believe me.

24:06.553 --> 24:08.992
Jessie, don't look.

24:16.942 --> 24:19.347
That is what's coming.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.214
And if you don't put the bones
in the lake by sundown,

24:22.275 --> 24:24.364
Everyone will die.

24:30.656 --> 24:32.210
Baby, i'm so sorry.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.997
Carl and I were out, and then
one thing led to another and --

24:35.027 --> 24:36.893
I know how important
today was to you.

24:36.923 --> 24:37.846
You probably hate me,
don't you?

24:37.876 --> 24:39.077
Mom...
You should.

24:39.107 --> 24:40.566
'cause you are
too good to me.

24:40.596 --> 24:42.008
Mom.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.862
They said
I'm a perfect fit.

24:45.756 --> 24:46.733
Wait. What now?

24:46.763 --> 24:48.225
The admissions rep.

24:48.255 --> 24:50.420
He said that if I stay on track,

24:50.450 --> 24:52.417
I'll be in Evanston in the fall.

24:52.447 --> 24:53.731
Mom, this is huge!

24:53.761 --> 24:56.454
Oh, that's... that's...

24:56.484 --> 24:57.624
Mom, don't be sad.

24:57.654 --> 25:00.109
Mom, I'm going to college!
My dream school.

25:00.139 --> 25:02.529
No, I'm not sad, baby. I'm... I'm happy!

25:02.559 --> 25:05.182
It's just... It's just so...

25:06.529 --> 25:08.902
My baby's going to college.

25:08.932 --> 25:11.565
My baby's going to college!

25:12.230 --> 25:13.707
Well, let's celebrate.

25:13.737 --> 25:14.808
Okay. Yeah.

25:14.838 --> 25:16.330
Let's go!

25:26.616 --> 25:28.138
What's in the bag?

25:29.886 --> 25:31.627
I don't want to talk about it.

25:36.548 --> 25:39.841
You know you can trust me,
whatever this is, right?

25:40.430 --> 25:42.447
Doesn't feel like I
can trust anyone anymore.

25:42.477 --> 25:44.209
Yeah, I know that feeling.

25:44.362 --> 25:47.002
I was in that exact same boat
when I first got here.

25:47.114 --> 25:48.655
So what changed?

25:48.685 --> 25:50.094
Honestly?

25:50.151 --> 25:51.569
You.

25:53.397 --> 25:54.814
Knowing I could trust you

25:54.844 --> 25:57.196
made me think about everything
completely differently.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.713
Just listen to yourself,
to that voice in your head.

26:05.826 --> 26:09.241
If you can trust that,
you're on the right track.

26:27.465 --> 26:28.900
Hey.

26:29.450 --> 26:30.788
Hey.

26:30.818 --> 26:32.139
You okay?

26:32.169 --> 26:35.239
I just wanted to thank you
for sticking up for me.

26:35.269 --> 26:36.649
Yeah.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.149
They probably just...

26:38.987 --> 26:40.408
I don't know.

26:40.490 --> 26:42.102
I don't know what they were thinking.

26:42.132 --> 26:45.154
I think they're scared, and
they don't know who to trust.

26:46.353 --> 26:48.451
So does the offer still stand?

26:48.481 --> 26:51.095
Show me around before we have to go?

26:51.199 --> 26:53.493
Yeah. Of course.

26:53.559 --> 26:55.198
What'd you have in mind?

26:55.279 --> 26:57.987
I heard Eagle Creek was beautiful.
-Mm.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.950
I know it's Stillwater tradition
to hike out there.

26:59.980 --> 27:04.341
Well, tradition calls, and
we should definitely do it.

27:05.466 --> 27:06.444
Deb?

27:06.474 --> 27:08.323
I want to know what's going on.

27:08.659 --> 27:10.055
Why is Sykes really here?

27:10.085 --> 27:11.177
Uh, he...

27:11.207 --> 27:12.659
I just think he's confused.

27:12.689 --> 27:15.765
He wants to make sure
everything is really over.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.142
I was wondering the same thing.

27:18.356 --> 27:19.773
What do you mean?

27:20.854 --> 27:23.670
This eclipse, I think
it unlocked something.

27:24.310 --> 27:29.967
I think some things happened
at this camp, back in 1970,

27:29.997 --> 27:33.646
things that I... I forgot
or maybe I tried to forget,

27:33.676 --> 27:37.822
and I have seen some things this summer,

27:38.013 --> 27:39.426
things that...

27:40.202 --> 27:41.548
scared me...

27:41.578 --> 27:43.523
things that I wasn't prepared to see.

27:43.553 --> 27:47.831
I think we've all had strange
experiences this summer.

27:48.263 --> 27:51.658
But we get to choose
which memories we take with us.

27:51.688 --> 27:52.632
Right?

27:52.662 --> 27:54.083
Yeah.

27:54.141 --> 27:57.040
Uh, I'm gonna show her Eagle Creek.

27:57.070 --> 28:01.110
It's the last day of camp,
and she's never seen it before.

28:02.956 --> 28:04.461
It's beautiful there.

28:09.807 --> 28:11.180
Jessie.

28:11.714 --> 28:14.381
Jessie! What the hell are you doing?

28:15.009 --> 28:15.983
Jessie!

28:16.013 --> 28:17.730
Joel, leave her alone!

28:18.012 --> 28:18.974
It's a trick.

28:19.004 --> 28:19.968
Trust me.

28:19.998 --> 28:20.843
No.

28:20.873 --> 28:21.681
You don't know what you're doing.

28:21.711 --> 28:23.410
Hey, let go of me.

28:44.922 --> 28:46.625
What the hell is going on?

28:47.147 --> 28:48.561
Where are we?

28:48.655 --> 28:50.069
I don't know.

28:58.888 --> 29:00.623
They can't see us.

29:07.688 --> 29:11.013
Do not be afraid, my
brothers and sisters.

29:11.579 --> 29:13.141
Step across.

29:22.779 --> 29:23.807
No!

29:23.837 --> 29:26.559
Stop! It's a purification!

29:26.589 --> 29:27.991
No!

29:31.746 --> 29:34.107
The militia will be here soon,

29:34.137 --> 29:36.970
and they will believe you did this.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.762
Come on.
-Jessie.

30:06.198 --> 30:08.231
We have to see this through.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.426
Whatever it is.

30:54.289 --> 30:55.983
I don't understand.

30:56.679 --> 30:58.118
What are we doing here?

30:58.481 --> 31:00.720
You left me no other choice.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.555
You had to see it for yourself.

31:02.585 --> 31:04.382
- See what?
- The truth.

31:04.412 --> 31:07.381
My brother killed himself
because of you.

31:07.916 --> 31:11.325
What you think you know you do not.

31:11.566 --> 31:14.154
The time has come for the two
of you to stop fighting.

31:14.184 --> 31:15.698
You must work together.

31:15.728 --> 31:18.963
Because I am going to need you.

31:19.085 --> 31:20.516
Find Amy.

31:20.652 --> 31:22.642
The demon lives within her.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.603
No, she passed the test.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.248
The demon is a master of deception.

31:27.470 --> 31:28.815
You're going to kill her.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.275
No.

31:30.325 --> 31:33.051
I am going to save her.

31:34.717 --> 31:36.962
Let no harm come to her.

31:36.992 --> 31:39.480
That will only empower the demon.

31:40.022 --> 31:42.113
Bring her here.

31:42.292 --> 31:44.291
I'll be waiting.

31:51.193 --> 31:53.567
- Don't you move!
- That's him!

31:55.459 --> 31:58.033
Jessie. Jessie!

31:58.063 --> 32:00.107
Joel, what's going on?

32:00.137 --> 32:01.828
It's like you guys were in a trance.

32:02.371 --> 32:03.583
We were wrong.

32:03.613 --> 32:04.854
- About what?
- Holyoke.

32:04.884 --> 32:06.568
- He's not what you think.
- He's good.

32:06.598 --> 32:08.173
And he's the only one who can help us.

32:08.203 --> 32:09.169
Help us what?

32:09.199 --> 32:10.635
Save Amy.

32:14.370 --> 32:16.448
Jessie, you can't trust
what Holyoke told you.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.168
We tested Amy. She passed, remember?

32:18.198 --> 32:19.897
No, she tricked us.

32:19.968 --> 32:21.071
You have to trust me, Garrett.

32:21.101 --> 32:22.205
And I'm telling you,

32:22.235 --> 32:23.785
we need to save her
while there's still time.

32:23.815 --> 32:25.336
Save her from what?

32:25.831 --> 32:27.342
No more lies.

32:27.665 --> 32:29.572
Amy... needs help.

32:29.602 --> 32:31.489
Help? What kind of help?

32:31.648 --> 32:33.383
Something...
Something has taken ahold of her,

32:33.413 --> 32:35.140
something bad.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.287
I need you to take care of
the kids while we go find her.

32:37.317 --> 32:40.172
She's at Eagle Creek with Alex,
and I'm going with you.

32:40.202 --> 32:41.124
Are you sure?

32:41.154 --> 32:42.483
Yes. Why?

32:44.510 --> 32:46.265
Eagle Creek is the fifth point.

32:46.295 --> 32:47.164
What does that mean?

32:47.194 --> 32:49.686
It means someone's going to
die there if we don't hurry.

33:00.635 --> 33:02.147
What's wrong?

33:03.894 --> 33:06.577
Last time I was supposed to stargaze...

33:06.846 --> 33:08.462
was with Cricket.

33:17.450 --> 33:19.217
What are you doing?

33:20.171 --> 33:22.093
It's my last night at camp.

33:22.545 --> 33:24.889
Let's make it one to remember.

34:27.597 --> 34:30.065
See, now, you have to trust your mama

34:30.096 --> 34:33.036
when she says she knows
how to have a good time.

34:33.728 --> 34:35.071
Maybe I should drive.

34:35.101 --> 34:36.688
With what license?

34:36.719 --> 34:39.042
Baby, I'm fine.

34:39.072 --> 34:40.929
You're drunk, Mom.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.107
Yeah, I am.

34:43.594 --> 34:45.341
I am drunk.

34:46.135 --> 34:47.793
- 'Cause my baby's leaving me.
- Mom...

34:47.822 --> 34:49.739
Well, who's gonna take care
of me when you're gone?

34:49.770 --> 34:51.507
Did you ever think about that?

34:52.554 --> 34:55.380
Mom, I spent my whole life
taking care of you.

34:55.748 --> 34:57.160
I thought you were happy for me.

34:57.190 --> 34:59.865
I didn't think
you'd ever actually do it.

35:01.956 --> 35:03.718
So you never believed in me?

35:03.748 --> 35:05.068
- Ugh.
- What'd you think I was doing

35:05.098 --> 35:08.392
working a fryer for two years,
saving every penny?

35:08.985 --> 35:11.273
So, what, you were just humoring me?

35:11.725 --> 35:12.976
How selfish can you be?!

35:13.006 --> 35:15.212
I gave up the best years
of my life to raise you,

35:15.242 --> 35:17.033
and this is how you repay me?

35:17.146 --> 35:19.285
I would have never left you.

35:34.780 --> 35:36.317
Mom, you're supposed to
want what's best for me.

35:36.347 --> 35:37.400
And what about me, Jessie?

35:37.430 --> 35:39.748
What am I supposed
to do when you're gone?

35:48.076 --> 35:49.486
Mom?

35:49.744 --> 35:51.167
Mom!

35:59.405 --> 36:00.851
Mom?

36:00.928 --> 36:02.377
Mom!

36:05.695 --> 36:07.193
Oh.

36:10.508 --> 36:13.186
Oh, baby, you got to
switch seats with me.

36:13.216 --> 36:14.339
- What?
- I have two priors!

36:14.369 --> 36:15.549
They're gonna throw the book at me!

36:15.579 --> 36:17.207
But if I get arrested,
Northwestern will...

36:17.237 --> 36:18.803
North-Western?! North-Western?

36:18.833 --> 36:20.025
I am your mother.

36:20.055 --> 36:21.253
Do you want to see me go to prison?

36:21.283 --> 36:22.312
Now come on.

36:22.342 --> 36:24.180
I spent my whole life
looking out for you.

36:24.210 --> 36:25.625
Now come on.

36:32.094 --> 36:34.028
Oh, that's my sweet baby girl.

36:42.626 --> 36:44.498
Amy, get away from him!

36:44.824 --> 36:46.604
What the hell are you guys doing?

36:47.393 --> 36:50.363
W-We were worried. We just wanted to...

36:51.444 --> 36:53.602
Amy, come with us. We
just want to help you.

36:53.632 --> 36:55.857
You guys, you've helped me enough.

36:56.419 --> 36:59.149
All I wanted was to make
my last day at Stillwater

36:59.179 --> 37:00.778
one to remember.

37:01.236 --> 37:03.480
And now that you're all here, I can.

37:03.510 --> 37:05.403
- No!
- Amy, stop!

37:05.617 --> 37:07.551
Amy, what's going on?

37:08.088 --> 37:10.254
- What are you doing?
- Amy?

37:12.364 --> 37:13.775
This isn't you.

37:14.873 --> 37:16.894
Amy, what the hell are you doing?

37:18.018 --> 37:19.668
Put the knife down.

37:20.429 --> 37:21.853
Don't.

37:22.392 --> 37:23.838
Put the knife down, Amy.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.306
Listen to him.

37:26.831 --> 37:28.505
You don't want to do this.

37:39.230 --> 37:40.633
No.

37:41.276 --> 37:42.681
I don't.

37:47.873 --> 37:49.305
It's okay.

37:49.779 --> 37:51.782
Holyoke told me and Jessie...

37:52.681 --> 37:54.277
to come save you.

37:55.931 --> 37:57.238
I know.

37:58.204 --> 37:59.958
- No!
- No!

38:03.027 --> 38:04.080
Joel.

38:04.110 --> 38:06.329
But I don't want to be saved.

38:08.595 --> 38:10.889
Fooled you.

38:13.650 --> 38:15.236
Oh, my God.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.826
It's your turn, baby girl.

38:18.925 --> 38:20.407
It's your turn.

38:22.158 --> 38:24.111
Garrett, no. We can't hurt her.

38:24.141 --> 38:25.374
She killed Joel.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.688
We have to save her. We can't...

38:26.718 --> 38:28.137
No!

38:45.051 --> 38:46.826
Aah!

38:46.856 --> 38:48.963
Let go of me!

38:49.676 --> 38:51.288
You know where to go!

38:55.831 --> 38:58.905
I have to get the kids out of here.

38:59.283 --> 39:00.697
Right now.

39:09.544 --> 39:10.949
Joel...

39:11.007 --> 39:12.596
I'm so sorry.

39:14.340 --> 39:16.104
But we can still save Amy.

39:16.134 --> 39:17.866
Come on. Follow me.

40:05.064 --> 40:08.092
Let us... begin.
