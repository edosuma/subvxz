00:35.720 --> 00:37.240
Right, what have we got?

00:37.240 --> 00:38.800
I've narrowed it down to three.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.960
Nae repeats, mind.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.240
Naw, nae repeats. We're no' going up
the rubbish channels, either.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.480
BBC Nine and all that shite.
That's the wrong end of town.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.400
And I'm no' watching Gobblebox.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.680
Gogglebox?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.840
What did I say? Gobblebox.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.960
That would just be a pile of people
sitting round watching porno movies.

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
Oh, aye, aye.

00:58.960 --> 01:03.480
Right, so the frontrunner is
A Mile In My Shoes, a doc.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.920
The trials and tribulations of two
men swapping their lives

01:06.920 --> 01:08.400
for a period of time.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.160
One's a chairman of a big company,

01:10.160 --> 01:12.600
and the other guy's a bampot.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.400
That sounds brutal.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.440
Socially experimenting on people.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.120
That's Mengele pish.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.320
Aye...

01:19.320 --> 01:21.880
Camera crew - "Right, come here,"
filming him.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.800
Boy's making an arse of it,
we're sitting at home heehawing

01:24.800 --> 01:26.600
and laughing at the poor bastard's
misery.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.680
It's definitely no' right.
It's bad form.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.920
Do you want to watch it?
Aye, get it on.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.280
Here, I wonder what would happen if
you and I swapped houses, Victor.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.080
Well, I'd come to you on a Tuesday
and you'd come to me on a Wednesday.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.080
Aye, as opposed to me coming to you
on a Tuesday

01:42.080 --> 01:44.600
and you coming to me on a Wednesday.
I would, however,

01:44.600 --> 01:48.560
be worried about my chip pan if you
were living in my house. How so?

01:48.560 --> 01:51.080
Well, I'd be lying in my bed -
actually your bed -

01:51.080 --> 01:52.920
eyes staring out my head,

01:52.920 --> 01:56.080
worried sick that you'd be rummaging
about in my kitchen,

01:56.080 --> 01:57.560
drunk on my drink,

01:57.560 --> 02:00.000
looking for things to deep-fry
in my chip pan.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.720
And why not? I'd be hungry.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.400
But I'd be bitterly disappointed

02:03.400 --> 02:06.520
because you've no' got anything in
your cupboards except tins.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.199
So then I'd be arseing about with
your shonky can-opener

02:09.199 --> 02:12.480
trying to wheedle the Spam out the
tin and into your fryer.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.400
There it is right there, Jack, eh?

02:14.400 --> 02:18.000
Frying Spam in the dead of night,
three sheets to the wind.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.560
"Oh, I know what I'll dae.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.760
"That Spam'll take
a wee while to cook through.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.040
"I'll just have a wee snooze on the
couch here cos I'm leathered."

02:25.040 --> 02:26.600
Oh, I know what this is.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.320
This is a chip-pan-fire scenario,
innit?

02:29.320 --> 02:32.080
Yes. First the handle -
puddle of black plastic.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.840
Then my curtains - boof!

02:33.840 --> 02:36.720
The whole kitchen ablaze.
The guy upstairs going off his nut,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.760
wondering where all the
heat's coming from!

02:38.760 --> 02:41.120
And me, at my age,
up umpteen floors

02:41.120 --> 02:42.640
on a fireman's ladder,

02:42.640 --> 02:44.480
trying to get out the building.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.360
That widnae bother me. How?

02:46.360 --> 02:47.960
Cos my worries would be over.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.720
I'd be burnt to crisp.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.360
Jack Black.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.480
Aye, lucky you, eh(?)

02:53.480 --> 02:55.440
Aye, well, that's a result.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.960
Oh! What?

02:56.960 --> 02:58.560
I've got chips on!

02:58.560 --> 03:01.040
HE CHUCKLES

03:06.200 --> 03:07.680
Enjoy your roll.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.240
Thanks, Sinead, hen.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.600
Oh!

03:13.400 --> 03:15.960
Please, Isa, join us(!)

03:15.960 --> 03:17.360
What can I get you?

03:17.360 --> 03:19.280
Oh, nothing for me.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.120
Just a tea, hen.
I'm watching my weight.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.800
I'll maybe have a wee roll
wi' sausage,

03:24.800 --> 03:28.760
and put an egg on it,
a wee bit of bacon.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.680
What's that you've got, Victor?
Roll and black pudding.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.840
Aye, a wee bit of black pudding
an' all, hen.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.800
Stick a tattie scone on the top
of it.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.200
Do you want beans an' all? Naw!

03:38.200 --> 03:39.960
SHE LAUGHS

03:39.960 --> 03:42.040
Well, maybe a wee forkful, hen.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.280
Right.

03:43.280 --> 03:47.360
Oh, uh, Sinead, congratulations on
your one-year anniversary.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.600
That's flew in.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.240
How did you know?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.320
I just seen wee Fergie
across the road.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.160
He was buying you something nice.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.360
Of course I'll no' say what it is.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.200
Flowers!

03:58.200 --> 03:59.880
That's remarkable, Isa.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.120
You manage to order the whole world
on a roll and keep a secret

04:03.120 --> 04:04.840
for 52 whole seconds.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.040
Shut up.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.840
A wee slice of tomato an' all, hen.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.520
Tomato. Can I get that to go?
Aye, nae bother.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.960
We've got a wheelbarrow
oot the back.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.240
Eh?

04:14.240 --> 04:15.440
Nothing.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.720
All right, team? Ah, Fergie.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.279
Happy anniversary, son. Flowers.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.360
All right, doll?

04:25.360 --> 04:26.960
Happy anniversary.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.600
Aw, they're lovely.
I got you some aftershave.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.200
What were you doing,
spending all that money?

04:32.200 --> 04:33.440
Calvin Klein?!

04:33.440 --> 04:35.080
No. It was only six quid.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.720
Calvin Klone.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.400
Thanks. Fire us up a roll
and scrambled egg, will you?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.360
SHE COUGHS

04:49.240 --> 04:51.480
Are you doing anything special
tonight?

04:51.480 --> 04:52.800
We're gonnae get a KFC.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.040
Fitting.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.800
I'm no' quite across what
all the anniversary years are.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.200
I know 50's golden and 40's ruby.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.440
So one year must be...chicken?

05:02.440 --> 05:05.880
No! Sure the first year's paper.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.040
Which a KFC is wrapped in.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.280
That was my thinking. Aye.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.640
Ohhh... What's the matter?
No...

05:15.640 --> 05:17.320
Nothing...

05:18.400 --> 05:20.040
Here you!

05:20.040 --> 05:21.920
That's enough of that. What?

05:21.920 --> 05:23.440
Looking at that lassie.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.080
What lassie?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.280
THAT lassie.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.840
What, her?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.840
That lassie that just came in there
in the two-piece suit

05:30.840 --> 05:34.960
and sat down at the window, with the
flattering light on her? Aye.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.680
I wisnae looking at her.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.840
You were.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.880
You're allowed to look, aren't you?
Fergie!

05:42.000 --> 05:45.240
Well, she's happy enough
wi' her flowers.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.720
Enjoy your roll.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.920
Isa, do you want
a hand out the door wi' that?

05:54.920 --> 05:57.440
Where did you get the flowers?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.720
Across the road.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.480
At least you didnae get them out the
garage, like a lazy bastard.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.920
I got them out the garage
across the road.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.400
You lazy bastard.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.960
Hi, Isa.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.440
Boabby, son.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.520
Wow, Navid. 40 year!

06:18.520 --> 06:21.360
Congratulations. That is some shift.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.800
Thank you, Boabby.
I thought, "How do you mark it?"

06:24.800 --> 06:26.440
You give something back.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.000
So I've rolled back the
prices to 1976.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.440
Excellent.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.560
I'll take two dozen bottles of
Scotch and all your fags.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.320
Scotch and smokes are exempt.
Why's that?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.800
Because I never had time to
phone Customs and Excise

06:39.800 --> 06:42.560
to inform them that some poxy shop
in Craiglang

06:42.560 --> 06:44.320
was having a rollback experience.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.680
Fair enough.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.840
A packet of Nic Naks, then.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.280
55 pence.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.280
They're always 55 pence.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.920
Where is my 1976 rollback?

06:54.920 --> 06:57.520
My shop opened in 1976.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.240
Nic Naks were launched in 1981.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.920
They are also exempt from the
rollback bonanza.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.720
Fine! A tube of Pringles.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.360
Pringles have been around
for donkey's.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.840
I'm afraid you are the donkey here,
Boabby.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.360
Pringles, the taste sensation,

07:13.360 --> 07:16.480
burst onto the snack scene in 1967.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.920
Good. Get them beeped.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.640
But that was in the US.

07:21.640 --> 07:26.520
In the UK, they were launched
in 1991. Exempt!

07:26.520 --> 07:29.040
Have you actually got anything
from 1976

07:29.040 --> 07:32.440
that costs what it cost in 1976,
Navid? Of course.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.400
This shop is a treasure trove
of savings today.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.080
You, uh, just need to find them.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.920
Da-dee!

07:44.480 --> 07:45.920
Warm.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.120
Warm.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.240
Hot. Hot. Roasting!

07:49.240 --> 07:50.360
Cold again.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.840
SHE MOUTHS

08:03.680 --> 08:05.960
Bleach?! You dick!

08:08.080 --> 08:09.600
Well done.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.240
Sale Of The Century.
The Price Is Right. Bleach!

08:13.240 --> 08:17.320
Okey dokey, then.
Today's price - 35 pence.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.920
1976 rollback bonanza price -

08:20.920 --> 08:22.600
34 pence.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.200
Ah! Nae luck, Boabby.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.080
Thanks for playing.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
Have you enjoyed your time with us?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.600
Aye, I've had a lovely...
Oh, for fu...

08:31.600 --> 08:34.840
Unbelievable! Bloody bleach.
I don't even need bleach.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.679
You don't need bleach? I've smelt
the toilets in the Clansman.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.679
SHE LAUGHS

08:40.679 --> 08:43.960
I'm a busy man, Navid.
I don't need this garbage.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.040
How are you busy?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.920
I've got the brewers
coming in the day.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.720
I've got barrels to change.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.360
I've got the cellar to clean.
I've got stocktake.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.480
It's all right for you, eh?
You've got it cushy.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.800
Cushy?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.360
You've got your missus doing all
your heavy lifting.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.120
You've got Isa cleaning the
place for you,

09:05.120 --> 09:08.680
sweating like Susan Boyle
in a cake shop,

09:08.680 --> 09:13.280
while you sit on your wee throne,
watching Loose Women.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.280
Cushy.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.720
Cheeky bastard.
There's nothing cushy about my job.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.800
TRANSLATION:

09:32.520 --> 09:35.800
Eric. Jack. Victor.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.000
Hi, Fergie.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.480
Have you got a minute?

09:38.480 --> 09:41.280
Lager, please, Boabby.
What do you want, Fergie?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.720
It's delicate.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.640
Uh-huh.
It's about...marriage and that,

09:45.640 --> 09:47.680
and I want to ask you guys advice.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.280
On marriage?

09:49.280 --> 09:52.400
No, no, you're talking to two old
fellas from a different era.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.840
I mean, I was married
at 21, for God's sake.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.280
An eejit! A young daftie.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.200
Aye, me an' all.
I don't know what I was thinking.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.160
21! Stupid, doolally bastard.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.120
I got married at 21.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.840
Did you, son? Carry on.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.000
I see yous two as the ancients.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.360
I'm no' sure I like that,
"ancients".

10:11.360 --> 10:14.240
No! The elder statesmen.
The wise men.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.320
Go on.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.720
It's just...

10:16.720 --> 10:18.240
See my marriage?

10:18.240 --> 10:21.440
I'm not saying it's no' good,
but a lot of time's passed.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.040
A year's a long time?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.640
Huh, right enough, aye.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.800
You must be sick of the sight
of one another.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.440
The old 12-month itch.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.080
Is this because you were ogling
at that lassie

10:32.080 --> 10:34.960
in the cafe the other day?
I've no' done nothing. Good.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.400
It's just...

10:36.400 --> 10:40.280
when I married Sinead, I hadn't
really been with anybody else.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.240
She's beautiful an' all that,

10:42.240 --> 10:44.520
I just feel I jumped in a bit quick.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.040
Right, let me stop you right there,
Fergie.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.280
Temptation is the trial of
every red-blooded man.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.360
Marriage is like
a fine old classic car.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.440
If you leave it lying,
well, it goes rusty.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.640
And then when you're
wanting inside it,

10:58.640 --> 11:01.480
you try to get your key in,
it'll no' start.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.520
You get me?
So, if you've got a classic car,

11:04.520 --> 11:07.800
make sure you're always
polishing the bonnet.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.520
I have been polishing the bonnet.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.440
Aye, but now you're wanting to

11:11.440 --> 11:13.840
polish this other lassie's
headlights. Eh?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.680
You see, Fergie, your modern women
have all these new needs.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.760
You know, fresh demands.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.480
Like the cly-toris.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.280
Don't get embarrassed, Fergie.
Victor's right.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.040
Today, it's all about the
cly-torises

11:25.040 --> 11:27.880
and making a real effort to reach
your woman's G Plan.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.240
G-spot, Jack.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.760
G-spot? What did I say?

11:30.760 --> 11:32.680
G Plan. That's furniture.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.280
Oh, aye.

11:34.280 --> 11:37.160
So, when you have located
the G-spot...

11:37.160 --> 11:39.400
Listen, guys, that'll dae me.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.960
That's plenty.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.520
No, give us a minute,
we know what we're talking about.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.520
You've seen Kayleigh.
She's beautiful, man.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.400
What would you dae?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.760
I'll tell you what I'd dae.
Carpe diem.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.240
Carpe diem?

11:52.240 --> 11:54.360
Carpe diem, Fergie.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.840
Carpe diem...

11:59.120 --> 12:00.440
Carpe diem.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.680
Two lager, Boabby.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.080
What does "carpe diem" mean, Jack?

12:07.080 --> 12:08.800
Carpe diem? It's Latin, sure.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.920
It means do right thing.
Toe the line.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.560
Behave yourself.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.320
Oh, aye, stick with the missus.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.240
Straighten up and fly right!

12:16.240 --> 12:17.960
Carpe diem!

12:17.960 --> 12:22.640
Have you got 50 pence
for a cup of tea, mate? No?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.280
Mick?

12:24.280 --> 12:26.880
Aw, Fergie, it's yourself.

12:26.880 --> 12:31.640
Aye. Here, Mick, you're good wi'
words and that, aren't you?

12:31.640 --> 12:35.080
It has been suggested that my
loquaciousness is legendary.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.680
Aye, well, have you heard the
phrase...

12:41.040 --> 12:43.000
"...carpe diem"?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.840
Yes. What about it?

12:44.840 --> 12:46.240
What does it mean?

12:46.240 --> 12:47.800
It's a Latin aphorism,

12:47.800 --> 12:52.720
taken from book one of the Roman
poet Horace's work Odes from 23 BC,

12:52.720 --> 12:54.880
which I don't hold with.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.840
I reckon it's later.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.560
Aye, later.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.320
But what does it mean?

13:00.320 --> 13:04.560
Seize the day, as in now,
get it done.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.600
Don't leave it hinging
till it gets minging.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.800
Seize the day?!

13:10.920 --> 13:13.400
Wow. Thanks, Jack.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.720
Thanks, Victor.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.400
Seize the day.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.320
Here I come, seize the day.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.400
Navid? What can I get you?

13:24.400 --> 13:27.920
You can get me an apology.
Make it a large one!

13:27.920 --> 13:30.240
Apologise? For what?

13:30.240 --> 13:33.440
All that cushy crack in the shop.
What about it?

13:33.440 --> 13:37.760
Let me take you back 40 years to
when I started my cushy wee shop.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.440
I was the only dark face in
all of Craiglang.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.480
Every time I put my shutters up,
somebody put my windows in.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.560
Every time I shut my shop at night,
somebody broke in.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.720
Chucking out alcoholics,

13:51.720 --> 13:54.160
patting down shoplifters,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.000
battling neds,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.520
dodging boys with blades.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.360
It was a war zone.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.440
And meanwhile,
what were you doing, eh?

14:03.440 --> 14:07.880
"Oh, would you like a piece of ice
in your Campari and soda?"

14:07.880 --> 14:11.240
"Oh, salted or dry roasted?"

14:11.240 --> 14:13.200
So what are you getting at?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.240
I'll tell you what I'm getting at.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.400
I could do your job
standing on my head.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.880
But you widnae last ten minutes
in my place.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.160
So apologise,
or walk a mile in my shoes.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.680
Thing is, Navid,

14:27.680 --> 14:30.760
sometimes I just open my mouth
and I let my belly rumble.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.400
I've upset you and, for that,
I'm sorry.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.000
Well, good.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.280
I accept.

14:39.280 --> 14:44.040
So you away back to your cushy
wee sweetie shop!

14:44.040 --> 14:46.240
Bastard! Oh, Jesus!

14:46.240 --> 14:48.960
Whoa! Whoa! That's enough,
that's enough.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.480
Stop that! Two grown men fighting!

14:51.480 --> 14:54.800
Well, one grown man and another one
wi' learning difficulties,

14:54.800 --> 14:57.680
but you know what I mean. Enough.
Did I get that right, Boabby?

14:57.680 --> 14:59.720
You're saying Navid's job is easy?

14:59.720 --> 15:01.520
Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy!

15:01.520 --> 15:04.400
Lemon squeezy, eh?
I'll squeeze your neck!

15:04.400 --> 15:06.240
Settle down, settle down!

15:06.240 --> 15:09.280
And you're saying, Navid,
that Boabby's job's easier?

15:09.280 --> 15:11.080
Easier. Peasier.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.200
Lemon squeezier.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.600
Right. Well,
there's only one way to solve this.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.560
HE GULPS

15:25.560 --> 15:27.960
SULTRY MUSIC PLAYS

15:33.440 --> 15:35.280
Ooh...

16:01.840 --> 16:04.240
MUSIC STOPS

16:06.360 --> 16:07.880
No sale.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.320
Boabby, where are you?
We're parched here!

16:25.320 --> 16:26.680
Service, please!

16:26.680 --> 16:30.520
NAVID: Give us a minute! I'm in the
cellar changing a bloody barrel.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.200
Is that Navid's voice?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.560
It's magic, eh?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.360
Already? First one that runs
greeting to the other loses?

16:36.360 --> 16:38.360
Oh, this is going to be brilliant.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.400
Oh, it's a good time to be alive.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.960
Ah, here we go.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.520
Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.680
AMERICAN ACCENT: Well, what do you
say to that, Bing?

16:51.680 --> 16:54.160
AMERICAN ACCENT:
# Give us a couple of drinks

16:54.160 --> 16:56.480
# Ba-ba-ba-bawbag! #

16:56.480 --> 16:57.920
Two pints, prick!

16:57.920 --> 16:59.320
What did you say to me?

16:59.320 --> 17:00.680
Two pints.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.920
After that?

17:01.920 --> 17:04.040
Prick.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.319
I'm a prick?

17:05.319 --> 17:07.839
You come in here, all puffed up,

17:07.839 --> 17:10.079
and you call me a male appendage?

17:10.079 --> 17:14.880
A sexual organ? A dirty, filthy,
stinking, unwashed phallus?

17:14.880 --> 17:16.920
Hold on, Navid,
this isnae how it works.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.240
You're not meant...
No, we normally we come here...

17:19.240 --> 17:21.040
Yes, you come in and humiliate
the man

17:21.040 --> 17:23.800
in the foulest sense,
in front of the community?

17:23.800 --> 17:26.240
Not on my watch, you cheeky wankers!

17:27.240 --> 17:29.040
Oh, well, sorry. Sorry.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.960
What do you want?

17:30.960 --> 17:36.000
Two pints of lager and a bag of salt
and vinegar crisps, please, Navid.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.240
Salt and vinegar...
salt and vinegar...salt and vinegar.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.720
Isa, jump down to the cellar,

17:42.720 --> 17:45.080
get a box of salt and vinegar
crisps, will you?

17:45.080 --> 17:47.120
I don't work for you in here, Navid.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.040
I work for you in the shop.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.280
A large whisky, please, Navid.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.320
Am I having a stroke?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.040
What's he...

18:00.040 --> 18:01.480
Don't ask.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.800
There you go.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.640
What's that?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.160
That's a whisky.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.840
No, I asked for a large whisky.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.400
Aye. But that'll do.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.880
Look, there's no' even enough in
there to clean my specs!

18:16.880 --> 18:19.280
Get another one in there.
No. What?

18:19.280 --> 18:22.600
I have known you for many years
and you only have two moods,

18:22.600 --> 18:24.680
despondency or rage.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.600
I believe the reason for this is

18:26.600 --> 18:28.920
that you are constantly
nursing a hangover.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.800
And that's why I want
a large whisky,

18:30.800 --> 18:32.520
because I've got a hangover.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.720
I'm trying to save you from the
endless roundabout of misery. OK.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.320
I'll be the first to admit that I do
drink a wee bit too much

18:41.320 --> 18:43.760
and I suppose I am on a bit of a
roundabo...

18:43.760 --> 18:46.240
Look, just get me a large whisky
in there,

18:46.240 --> 18:49.080
right now, before I say
something I regret!

18:49.080 --> 18:50.520
Say it.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.800
I want Boabby back.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.040
Where's my crisps?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.160
Isa!

19:02.160 --> 19:05.200
It's my day off, Navid!
I'm getting pished!

19:05.200 --> 19:07.400
Not on his shift, you're not!

19:10.360 --> 19:14.440
Meena, if you want to be with
Navid over at the Clansman,

19:14.440 --> 19:15.920
feel free.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.720
It's stone dead in here.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.960
TRANSLATION:

19:22.960 --> 19:26.200
Just take the afternoon.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.160
I've got this.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.640
SHE LAUGHS

19:38.680 --> 19:40.520
BUZZER

19:43.520 --> 19:45.160
THEY ROAR

19:45.160 --> 19:47.200
HE SCREAMS

19:52.720 --> 19:54.520
Here, what are you doing?

19:54.520 --> 19:57.400
I'm Doctor Who.
We're going back in time.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.040
HE SINGS

20:00.040 --> 20:02.360
Winston, keep an eye there.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.520
Tell me when Davros is coming out
from the back shop.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.200
Psst.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.520
Bit of service here, please, Navid.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.080
Certainly, Tam. What can I get you?

20:16.080 --> 20:18.040
Uh...a cheese toastie,

20:18.040 --> 20:20.840
a Cointreau and a packet of
Scampi Fries, please.

20:22.440 --> 20:26.040
Toastie, Cointreau, Scampi Fries.
28 pence, please.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.000
It'll be a couple of minutes
for your toastie.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.560
Oh, I don't mind waiting, Navid.
I like my cheese well melted.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.360
Sometimes, you know,
I think my brain has melted.

20:43.360 --> 20:47.040
I mean, what was I thinking,
coming round here to run a pub?

20:47.040 --> 20:50.400
I don't know the cost of anything
in a licensed public house.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.560
I'm just a daft Muslim
who runs a corner shop.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.560
BELL RINGS

20:55.560 --> 20:57.160
Oh, there's your toastie.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.600
28 pence, please.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.240
There you go. Thank you.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.400
Oh, I nearly forgot!
What do you want in your Cointreau?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.240
Just a wee dash of lemonade, please.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.600
So that's 28 pence for the drink,
the snack and the toastie

21:17.600 --> 21:19.400
and...

21:24.160 --> 21:27.120
...and £4.12 for the dash.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.240
Do you think my head buttons up
the back? Chancer!

21:41.360 --> 21:42.800
Jack! Victor!

21:44.200 --> 21:46.000
Fergie?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.280
Terrible, innit? Oh...

21:51.280 --> 21:55.560
Him sitting there, only
a year married, and look at him.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.920
Poor Sinead.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.480
I thought that boy had
his head screwed on.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.200
I don't know where
he got such an idea.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.320
Sweet sherry, Navid.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.960
(Fergie!)

22:09.520 --> 22:12.120
How yous doing?
Are yous good? Aye?

22:12.120 --> 22:14.720
"How yous doing"?!
What are YOU doing? Eh?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.880
I'm just doing
what you told me to do.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.160
What did we tell you to do?
Seize the day!

22:19.160 --> 22:20.920
I never said that!

22:20.920 --> 22:22.440
What did I say? Carpe diem.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.400
That's right. Seize the day!

22:24.400 --> 22:26.000
No, that's no' what it means.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.760
It means do the right thing,
toe the line, behave yourself.

22:28.760 --> 22:32.280
Winston, what's your understanding
of the term "carpe diem"?

22:32.280 --> 22:36.280
Seize the day. Act immediately.
Now is the moment.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.560
It means get her knickers off!

22:38.560 --> 22:40.640
Scantium pull-doonium!

22:40.640 --> 22:42.280
Panties removis!

22:42.280 --> 22:44.000
THEY GROAN

22:44.000 --> 22:45.160
Navid, two lager, please.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.400
What did you do with the two
that I gave you? We drank them!

22:48.400 --> 22:50.640
And you're wanting another
two already?

22:50.640 --> 22:53.400
Give it another half hour,
I'll consider it.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.920
Stick another goldie in there,
Navid.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.640
Not for another 12 minutes,
you red-faced inebriate bastard.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.520
Fergie, listen to me.
You're a married man.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.960
Calm down. I'm just sitting with
the lassie, having a juice.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.560
It's all very innocent.

23:09.560 --> 23:14.400
Fergie, I thought it'd be nice to
ask my parents to join us.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.320
Mum, Dad, this is Fergie,
my new boyfriend.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.520
HE GASPS

23:23.320 --> 23:25.680
Fergie, you filthy wee pig.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.200
Sinead!

23:28.440 --> 23:30.240
Carpe dum-dums.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.480
'Mugged by a couple of kids.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.120
'How embarrassing.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.680
'Still...

23:41.680 --> 23:43.280
'nobody seen it.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.160
'Nobody needs to know.'

23:59.040 --> 24:01.080
BUZZER

24:02.440 --> 24:04.040
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

24:04.040 --> 24:05.520
Hi, Meena.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.200
TRANSLATION:

24:12.800 --> 24:15.840
Well? It's a simple question.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.760
What was the question again?

24:19.600 --> 24:23.920
I asked you who that lassie was
that came in when I kissed you.

24:25.160 --> 24:29.080
Well, that lassie that came in
there...

24:29.080 --> 24:30.600
then marched out...

24:32.160 --> 24:33.640
Who was that?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.040
Jack?

24:36.440 --> 24:38.000
Eh, Victor?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.160
Winston?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.680
Tam?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.240
Eric?

24:44.240 --> 24:45.880
Navid?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.600
The lassie is Sinead, Fergie's wife.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.800
The wee creep's married.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.880
You snake! Right, you, you wee
shit!

24:55.880 --> 24:59.720
It's no' KFC you're getting the
night. It's GBH.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.360
RAISED VOICES

25:04.720 --> 25:06.240
Quiet, please.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.760
Can you be quiet?

25:07.760 --> 25:10.080
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

25:10.080 --> 25:11.720
Be quiet!

25:11.720 --> 25:15.480
Thank you. Right, Isa, will you tell
us what you saw?

25:15.480 --> 25:19.560
Aye. Well, there's things I saw
but I heard much more.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.280
Mary Shaw, that works in the
laundromat... Yous know Mary?

25:23.280 --> 25:25.000
She's just left her man

25:25.000 --> 25:28.800
cos he was stealing knickers
off washing lines...

25:28.800 --> 25:30.400
Yes, I know!

25:30.400 --> 25:33.400
Anyhow, she said that
Fergie and Kayleigh

25:33.400 --> 25:36.280

these last few days.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.200
I heard that an' all. I knew you two
would be in here.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.320
I've no' done anything!
Shut up! You'll get your say.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.560
Thanks very much, Isa. Now be quiet.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.880
What do you think she means
by "pally"?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.680
Pally? I'll tell you what she
means by "pally".

25:49.680 --> 25:51.280
You doing the dirty with my man!

25:51.280 --> 25:53.600
Oh, well,

25:53.600 --> 25:56.040
he widnae be sniffing round me!
What?!

25:56.040 --> 25:58.960
THEY ALL SHOUT

26:01.800 --> 26:03.480
Shut up!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.440
Every one of you!

26:05.440 --> 26:09.200
Two minutes I'm down there changing
a barrel, and I come up to what?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.160
Arma-bastard-geddon!

26:11.160 --> 26:15.360
You've got 30 seconds to take this
low-order, scum-sucking,

26:15.360 --> 26:20.480
gutter-sniping, red-neck,
Jeremy Kyle behaviour out of my pub!

26:20.480 --> 26:22.960
Right, you heard the man. Come on.

26:27.120 --> 26:30.080
Listen, Sinead. I didnae have any
idea he was married.

26:30.080 --> 26:34.800
Really? Really. But the main thing
is, nothing happened.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.640
Nothing at all.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.920
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see
what was out there.

26:46.920 --> 26:51.040
Fergie,
maybe we did get married too young.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.160
Go and see what's out there.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.640
Pint of lager, please.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.800
Aye, we'll take two lager
and, uh, Isa'll have a sherry.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.760
No! I'm
no' selling any more alcohol.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.160
What's your problem?

27:06.160 --> 27:09.560
You stand in that shop of yours
and you serve booze all day! Aye.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.560
But you go back to your rats'
nests and consume it.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.680
But in here, I have to witness it.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.120
It is like Sodom and Gomorrah...

27:17.120 --> 27:18.760
with crisps.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.640
You win.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.600
I want my pub back.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.760
NAVID CHUCKLES

27:27.760 --> 27:29.960
Oh, this is a great day.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.720
You want your pub back

27:31.720 --> 27:35.360

cushy at all, right?

27:36.400 --> 27:37.880
Right.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.440
Say it.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.760
Say what?

27:40.760 --> 27:43.360
"Navid, your shop is no' cushy."

27:46.400 --> 27:48.640
Your shop is no' cushy.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.600
Yes! I win! Champion!

27:51.600 --> 27:53.720
Damn right it's not cushy!

27:53.720 --> 27:57.520
But this pub?
This pub is crazy cushy!

27:57.520 --> 27:59.680
Piece of piss!

27:59.680 --> 28:01.800
Boabby, kiss my ar...

28:01.800 --> 28:05.080
THUMPS AND GROANS

28:06.800 --> 28:09.120
Bastarding pub.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.240
He's got a lovely arse.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.120
I deserved that.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.360
Oh, love's young dream!

28:44.360 --> 28:45.960
Hey, lads.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.040
Yous two patched things up, aye?

28:48.040 --> 28:51.760
Aye, after an appropriate
amount of grovelling. Six days.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.680
Aye, and two weeks in Santa Ponsa.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.440
Oh, that's excellent. Oh,
it's good you've sorted it out, eh?

28:56.440 --> 28:57.960
Que sera, sera.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.520
What does that mean?
Och, it's Latin phrase. It means...

29:00.520 --> 29:02.640
Shut up, Jack.
