The one thing that we could use
a little help in

00:06.239 --> 00:07.674
is anything that is off-market.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.777
I know I'm the new kid on the

00:10.810 --> 00:12.512
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.647
7.75. We have a deal.

00:14.681 --> 00:15.682
- You serious?
- Dead serious.

I need to sell that.

00:27.227 --> 00:29.963

how about this?

01:27.620 --> 01:28.855

01:28.888 --> 01:30.757
I won't show the place anymore

01:30.790 --> 01:32.492
and we'll make a deal.

<i>Luis: If this place</i>
<i>was already renovated,</i>

01:44.371 --> 01:47.440
<i>this would have cost</i>
<i>at least $2500 a foot.</i>

01:47.474 --> 01:49.209
<i>But because this place</i>
<i>needs so much work,</i>

01:49.242 --> 01:52.012
<i>the owner is willing to sell</i>
<i>at a price of 3.7,</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.980
<i>which is about $1300 a foot,</i>

01:54.014 --> 01:56.116
which is perfect
for an architect.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.451
It's an off-market deal,
which is great,

01:58.485 --> 02:00.120
because nobody else
could've found it.

02:00.153 --> 02:04.057
But in an off-market deal,
the seller has all the power.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.626
And now, this guy
wants to raise the price on us

02:06.659 --> 02:07.827
at the very last minute.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.163
<i>He already agreed to 3.7,</i>

02:10.196 --> 02:12.899

Well, okay, I'll, I'll go
talk to 'em. If, um...

02:17.504 --> 02:21.074
I just told 'em
the asking was 3.7, but...

there's the one problem

02:33.620 --> 02:36.256
and it's, um, and this happens
a lot in real estate.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.857
I'm sure you're very aware.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.926
The owner wants
a little bit more.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.795
Adam: A little bit more?
Luis: Yes.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.230
He wants, uh, 3.75.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.004
I am so sorry, man,
and I'll tell you--

02:51.104 --> 02:52.272
Well, here's, here's the thing.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.840
I mean, I'm a little upset

02:53.873 --> 02:54.908
that you went down
with one number

02:54.941 --> 02:56.142
and you've come back
with another,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.244
because that speaks
to the honor of the deal.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.480
Yes, but right now
this is an off-market deal

03:00.513 --> 03:01.781
and it's not set in stone.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.851
Obviously, uh,
I'm a man of my word myself,

03:04.884 --> 03:07.287
and I-- I wish I could actually
just strangle the guy.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.489
But $50,000 will mean
nothing to you

03:09.522 --> 03:11.458

I promise.

05:41.307 --> 05:43.410
Russians are becoming
more sophisticated and more--

05:43.443 --> 05:45.445
Less tacky.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.148
The Chinese think
about<i>feng shui</i>as critical.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.451
- Do they like swimming pools?
- Yes, water element.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.086
- Yes, water element. Yes.
- And...

05:53.086 --> 05:54.788

Russian? I mean, obviously--

05:54.821 --> 05:56.790
- Are you kidding? No budget.
Fredrik: No budget?

05:56.823 --> 05:58.692

- Uh, security.
- Security.

- Three exclamation marks.

about marble?

06:12.405 --> 06:13.606

- We love-- we love it.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.041
- Do you love it?
- I love--

06:15.075 --> 06:16.343
- I love it, too.
- I mean, oh, my God!

06:16.376 --> 06:18.445
Growing up,
everything had to be marble.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.447
Maybe your parents
want to buy the Marble House.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.421
Okay, um, I think this has been

<i>It is a great place</i>
<i>for buyers to come to now</i>

- How are you?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.635
- Good to see you.
- Wow!

07:15.669 --> 07:18.371
Lottie bought her apartment
about six years ago,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.641

- Wow. Ooh.
- So this is the great room.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.116
Ryan: This is unlike anything
I've ever seen

07:30.150 --> 07:31.718
in this building before.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.054
You can see the Empire State
Building from here.

07:34.087 --> 07:37.057
[upbeat music]

07:53.506 --> 07:55.875
Again, from this window,
you have a clear view at night

07:55.909 --> 07:57.243
of the Empire State Building.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.080
I actually live right there.
You can see my apartment--

08:00.113 --> 08:03.783
You know, I was wondering. Nick
told me you live down there.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.486
Which, I was wondering
if I could look in the window?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.321
My daughter has some binoculars.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.824
Maybe I should bring those
in here.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.158
Ryan: I also have binoculars.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.728
I recognize this room and you.
Just kidding.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.596
Ryan: Lottie's
a smokin' hot mom,

08:16.629 --> 08:18.665
so I'm gonna flirt with her
as much as I can,

08:18.698 --> 08:22.535
and if it gets me the listing,
let's do it.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.605
- It's very convenient.
- Good deal.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.510
So what do you think you
would list this apartment for?

08:30.543 --> 08:31.945
Ryan: What did you buy it for?

08:32.045 --> 08:34.614
Um, 1.395.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.416
What do you want to sell it for?

08:36.449 --> 08:37.884
As much as possible.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.452
Ten million dollars?

08:39.486 --> 08:41.321
- Yes, that sounds great.
Ryan: Yeah?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.189
If you look
at the other two bedrooms

08:43.223 --> 08:45.392
that I've sold,
both in this building, right

08:45.425 --> 08:47.327
and the comparables
we have in the area...

08:47.360 --> 08:48.328
Yeah?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.864
If we price it just under two,

08:50.897 --> 08:53.900
I think we'll have a very good
chance of selling it.

08:53.933 --> 08:57.370
What is the average
per square foot

08:57.404 --> 08:58.772
that has moved in this building?

08:58.805 --> 09:02.242
In this building you're looking
at, like, a 1000 to a 1050.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.844
So you think you can get
$200 more a square foot

09:04.878 --> 09:06.913
than the average sale
in the last year?

09:07.013 --> 09:08.014
Yeah.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.049
Why do you think we can

09:09.082 --> 09:11.017
actually move our apartment

09:11.017 --> 09:12.452
at that much more
per square foot?

09:12.485 --> 09:14.020
Because I'm your broker.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.857
Lottie: So here's what
I just heard.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.659
You will not negotiate
with the buyer

09:19.693 --> 09:21.761
and you will get me 1.945.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.030
- Deal.
- Thank you.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.198
Lottie: Good luck.
- Thank you.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.433
As soon as we sell this,

09:26.466 --> 09:27.767
we have to find
another place to live.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.069
- Upper East Side.
- Okay.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.370
You'd love the Upper East Side.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.539
Alright. Good.
You're the best.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.807
<i>Narrator: Coming up...</i>

09:33.840 --> 09:35.942
<i>Man 1: The worst of the weather</i>
<i>has come</i>

09:36.042 --> 09:38.044
and the city is feeling
the impact.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.046
Oh, my God, there's no traffic
lights. Nothing's workin'.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.048
<i>Ryan: I've never seen</i>
<i>Wall Street like this.</i>

09:42.048 --> 09:44.084
<i>It's a total ghost town.</i>

09:55.662 --> 09:56.863
Thank you very much.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.798
The financial district
is an incredible part

09:58.832 --> 10:00.333
of New York City.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.402
<i>There is a fresh</i>
<i>and authentic rush</i>

10:02.435 --> 10:05.171
<i>and adrenaline and speed</i>
<i>that doesn't stop.</i>

10:05.205 --> 10:07.140
And that's why I love
living down here.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.476
- Hey. How are you, Mr. Ortiz?
- There he is. Isaac.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.677
<i>Luis: I know pretty much</i>
<i>all the doormen</i>

10:10.710 --> 10:11.878
in the financial district.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.246
- Alright, man.
- Good to see you again.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.149
<i>And one of the doormen</i>
<i>at 15 Broad Street,</i>

10:16.182 --> 10:17.183
<i>a beautiful building,</i>

10:17.217 --> 10:19.319
introduced me to Kirk and Karen,

10:19.352 --> 10:22.655
who are very eager to sell
their one-bedroom apartment.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.791
Right now, the amount
of available units

10:24.824 --> 10:26.659
in 15 Broad is huge.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.495
- Wow! Ooh!
- So?

10:28.528 --> 10:29.562
Ryan: This is unlike anything
I've ever seen

10:29.596 --> 10:31.131
in this building before.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.234
And the competition
to get listings is intense.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.070
So, I really want
to impress Kirk.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.104
- Kirk.
- Luis.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.239
- How are you?
- How are you, sir?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.473
Pleasure to meet you.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.108
- Thank you very much--
- The pleasure's all mine.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.843
No, no.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.545
- Wow!
- Well, this is the place.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.013
Luis: Very, very nice.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.015
Alright, so, uh,
please show me around.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.985
[upbeat music]

10:56.389 --> 11:00.226
Kirk: If you come around here,
the view isn't spectacular,

11:00.260 --> 11:03.229
but outside you do have
the stock exchange.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.831
I-- I mean, it is limited.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.066
No, I think this is phenomenal.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.500
You want trees,
get yourself a farm.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.601
You want a beach, go to Miami.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.669
I don't think Miami can give you

11:09.703 --> 11:11.104
something as exciting
as this city.

11:11.137 --> 11:14.140
So, I actually like what I see,
and people will too.

11:15.141 --> 11:18.078
[upbeat music]

11:32.792 --> 11:35.428
Now, this is a phenomenal place.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.430
I am very, very glad
I came and saw it.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.598
I'm glad you like it.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.134
- Um, can I get you a drink?
- Yes.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.738
Okay, and I apologize
for, uh, not doing that earlier.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.506
What would you like? I got
a little bit of everything.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.441
You know what?
Vodka on the rocks.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.276
Okay. Alright. Good man.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.145
I'm gonna have whiskey,
if you don't mind.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.348
Boom! This negotiation should
be easier than I thought.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.217
Luis: So, um, do you want
to talk numbers?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.451
Yeah.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.286
I don't want to get ahead
of myself.<i>Salud.</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:01.321
<i>Salud.</i>

12:02.789 --> 12:04.758
Kirk: So price.
- Ah!

12:04.791 --> 12:06.726
We are looking for something...

12:08.161 --> 12:10.830
[sighs] around the 1.8 area

12:10.864 --> 12:13.600
because we put work
into this place.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.868
We've done a lotta things.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.771
- We feel strongly that--
- You know what?

12:17.804 --> 12:20.573
Sorry to interrupt, but...

12:20.607 --> 12:23.209
This is wh...
This is 1748 square feet?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.744
Yes, give or take. Yeah.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.546
Luis: Right now
in this building,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.548
everything that's one bedroom
with a home office,

12:28.581 --> 12:30.316
second bedroom
having no windows,

12:30.350 --> 12:32.185
is going for less than
a $1000 a foot.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.754
So, for it to be,
like, priced well

12:34.788 --> 12:36.656
for people to actually
even consider lookin' at it,

12:36.690 --> 12:38.558
it has to be, I think, at most,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.694
a little bit
under a 1000 a foot.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.696
Let's say, 1-- 1.69.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.835
Well, listen,
we love this place,

12:48.868 --> 12:51.304
and there are very few
apartments in this building

12:51.338 --> 12:54.841
where someone put the time in
to make it look good.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.877
And I know everybody
that comes in to my home,

12:57.911 --> 13:01.047
they legitimately like
what we've done with it.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.949
And I don't think
they're just being polite.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.252
Everybody feels
their apartment is very special.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.855
I understand.
I've heard that before.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.156
But I know the comps.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.891
<i>Luis: And if he wants</i>
<i>to sell this place,</i>

13:11.925 --> 13:13.059
he better listen to me.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.594
Listen, if I' going
to invest time,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.930
which I am eager to do,
I wanna make sure

13:16.963 --> 13:18.732
that, at least,
I can get people in the door

13:18.765 --> 13:22.168
so that I can do whatever
I do best when they're here.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.070
This is not the only place
out there.

13:24.070 --> 13:27.073
There is a lot of comparables
that are priced, you know,

13:27.073 --> 13:29.109
much better than, than 1.8.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.745
Uh, so we have to be pricing
at most,

13:31.778 --> 13:33.847
I'd say, 1.695.

13:36.916 --> 13:40.520
Okay, I'm reasonable,
but you're going to have to do

13:40.553 --> 13:43.089
the best possible job you can

13:43.089 --> 13:45.658
to get our home sold
at the best possible price.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.328
Okay. And you know what?
That is good enough for me.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.996
-<i>Salud?</i>
Kirk:<i>Salud.</i>

13:50.096 --> 13:52.132
You wanna finish your drink
or you-- you done or--

13:52.165 --> 13:54.601
- You know what? Can I?
- Sure.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.104
Mm. Ah!

14:05.111 --> 14:06.446
Victor: Hello, Fredrik.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.281
Fredrik: I need to speak to you
about the Marble House.

14:08.314 --> 14:12.085
Has anyone called? I mean,
do we have any private showings?

14:15.722 --> 14:17.590
<i>Fredrik: It's been three days</i>
<i>since I placed the ads</i>

14:17.624 --> 14:19.693
<i>in the Russian</i>
<i>and Chinese magazines,</i>

14:19.726 --> 14:21.261
<i>and I've heard nothing.</i>

14:21.294 --> 14:24.397
Is it me? Is it the market?
What is it?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.865
<i>It's very, very stressful.</i>

14:25.899 --> 14:27.867
I need the whole... You know,
this is top priority, Victor.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.503
The whole team needs to be
on this Marble House.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.874
Fredrik: Okay, and the mailer
needs to go out, too.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.444
That mailer needs to hit
5000 addresses

14:37.477 --> 14:39.379
all of downtown condominiums.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
<i>Failing is not an option</i>
<i>for me.</i>

14:41.414 --> 14:44.417
Not with Marble House
and nor with any other listing.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.987
The clock is ticking, and, um,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.690
I'm getting a little bit
worried, to be honest with you.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.660
[upbeat music]

14:57.597 --> 14:59.099
Ryan: Alright.
Everyone follow me.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.034
Come on.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.402
<i>Ryan: The biggest difficulty</i>
<i>I have</i>

15:02.435 --> 15:04.371
with selling an apartment
in 15 Broad

15:04.404 --> 15:07.140
<i>is that there are so many</i>
<i>apartments available downtown.</i>

15:07.173 --> 15:08.842
Ryan: Alright. Everyone here?

15:08.875 --> 15:10.477
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.679
When there's a lot of inventory
and not enough demand,

15:12.712 --> 15:14.381
things stay on the market
for a little while.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.317
So I need to literally hit
the street and bring them up.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.254
You look back behind us,
one block there,

15:21.287 --> 15:23.523
we have the memorial
and the New York Stock Exchange.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.492
That's our area of attack.
Give them a sheet.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.960
Convince them
this is the greatest apartment

15:27.060 --> 15:28.161
in the history of the world.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.396
<i>Wall Street is</i>
<i>the financial capital</i>

15:29.429 --> 15:30.897

15:32.065 --> 15:33.066
<i>with millions and millions</i>

15:33.066 --> 15:34.167
<i>of dollars in their pocket,</i>

to get their attention.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.270
Let's do it.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.742
Hi there. Are you lookin'
for an apartment?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.577
- You want to check it out?
- Want to buy an apartment?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.179
There you go.
Apartment for sale.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.181
Want to buy an apartment?
Alright.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.516
It's two-bedroom, two-bath.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.285
It's in this luxurious building
behind you.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.887
How are you? Would you like one?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.588
- What do you got going here?
- We're sellin' an apartment.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.257
It's right up there.
You can kind of see it.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.192
Like, if I were to stick my head
out, you'd be able to see me.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.427
This is good. Stand here.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.028
I'm gonna grab another girl
and send her over,

16:02.028 --> 16:05.165
and that will be, like,
a trifecta of hot redness

16:05.198 --> 16:06.766
selling an apartment.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.336
I know that I'm not gonna meet
someone on the street and then

16:09.369 --> 16:11.037
<i>take 'em up to the apartment</i>
<i>and they'll sign a contract.</i>

16:11.037 --> 16:12.505
<i>This is Wall Street,</i>
<i>everyone's working.</i>

16:12.539 --> 16:14.441
They have four minutes
for their lunch break.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.475
Ryan: What about those people
right over there?

16:15.508 --> 16:16.609
Or this guy in a suit?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.211
- Hello. How are you?
Woman 1: Hi.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.146
<i>But if I could get them</i>
<i>for two minutes of that</i>

16:20.180 --> 16:21.915
<i>or get their contact info,</i>

16:21.948 --> 16:24.617
then I've done my job,
and it's a success.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.885
- Want to buy an apartment?
- Yeah.

How are you,<i>papi?</i>
Good to see you.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.353
I have many connections,
but Isaac is, um,

17:00.387 --> 17:02.355
is someone that I know
since I started real estate.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.624
So I'm havin' an open house
in about an hour.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.526
I have, uh,
I'm actually having people

17:06.559 --> 17:08.862
from a, from a Latin-Cuban band
coming upstairs.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.597
I got sangria,
I made coquitos last night

17:10.630 --> 17:12.032
till 4:00 in the morning.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.500
So I'm expecting the best
at the first one.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.569
- It's, uh, Kirk's apartment.
Isaac: Very nice apartment...

17:16.603 --> 17:17.904
- Hello. What's going on?
- How can I help you?

17:17.937 --> 17:19.539
Ah, so I have
an open house today.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.041
There's gonna be
a lot of people coming through.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.043
Similar to the other day, you
saw the girls in red dresses.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.445
Yeah, so, uh,
I've got cupcakes here,

17:25.478 --> 17:27.047
so you can tell people
there are cupcakes,

17:27.047 --> 17:28.548
and I'll leave some show sheets
with you up at the front.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.083
- So if anybody comes through--
- What are you doing, man?

17:30.116 --> 17:31.117
So, we're having an open house,
so, that's the other open house

17:31.151 --> 17:33.386
or that's
the other open house...

17:33.420 --> 17:35.121
- Oh, you have an open house?
- Yes, I have an open house.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.191
Oh! I'm sorry.
I thought you worked here.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.093
Luis: I don't work here.
I'm Luis.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.495
And I'm a real estate agent,
also, and I have an open house.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.065
Very cool. Cool, cool.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.166
What floor
is your open house on?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.267
Luis: Eighth floor.
- Eighth floor?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.802
Oh, yeah, no, okay.
No, I know it.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.938
Big ceilings, right? But it's
just dark. Cool, cool, cool.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.173
If you want a cupcake,
you should come upstairs.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.674
She's bringing people.
It'll be sick.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.076
And, also, the other day
we had all these girls

17:56.076 --> 17:57.310
in red dresses outside
getting all these people,

17:57.344 --> 17:58.378
so it's gonna be
a little bit packed.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.679
So any of those people,
you know,

17:59.713 --> 18:01.748
that can't afford mine
'cause it's pretty awesome,

18:01.781 --> 18:04.084
I'll send 'em down to you,
the little guy.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.819
[laughing]

18:05.852 --> 18:08.088
- I like this guy already.
- Cool?

18:08.121 --> 18:09.089
And so I'll leave you
some show sheets

18:09.122 --> 18:10.557
up at the front
and we'll be good.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.859
Normally, I don't like
competition with other brokers

18:12.892 --> 18:15.528
within the same building,
but I'm not too worried

18:15.562 --> 18:17.130
about Ricky Martin
with the bouffant.

18:17.163 --> 18:20.233
Good luck. There's a lot
of competition in the building.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.869
- Good to meet ya.
- Scumbag.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.040
[speaking in foreign language]

18:33.580 --> 18:36.249
- Alright,<i>papi. Ciao.</i>
Isaac:<i>Ciao.</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:37.817
Okay.

18:37.851 --> 18:40.053
Oh, I love this place.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.287
<i>Ryan: Even though</i>
<i>there's a lot of apartments</i>

18:41.321 --> 18:42.555
<i>for sale in this building,</i>

18:42.589 --> 18:44.758
the guerilla marketing
that we did on the street

18:44.791 --> 18:46.059
<i>has been incredible.</i>

18:46.092 --> 18:47.961
<i>I mean, we gave out</i>
<i>all the flyers.</i>

18:48.061 --> 18:51.064
So I think the open house
is gonna be packed.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.699
[speaking in foreign language]

18:54.534 --> 18:56.469
Luis: Hey, you got
enough bottles, man?

18:56.503 --> 18:58.705
Alright, so I made this
last night. Coquito.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.840
For the past week,
I have been emailing and calling

19:00.874 --> 19:02.409
<i>every single broker in town.</i>

19:02.442 --> 19:04.010
Jackie: Hi, this is Jacqueline.
- Jackie!

19:04.010 --> 19:05.011
Mr. Jarrod: Hello?
- Mr. Jarrod.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.613
Yes, Perry, how are you?
Can you hear me?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.149
<i>Luis: And promising them that</i>
<i>if they come to my open house,</i>

19:09.182 --> 19:10.583
<i>I won't waste their time.</i>

19:10.617 --> 19:12.252
It's very, very well-priced,

19:12.285 --> 19:14.220
especially compared
to what's out there.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.855
Yup, yup. In the morning.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.424
<i>Once they try</i>
<i>this coquito of mine,</i>

19:17.457 --> 19:20.026
I know that the offers
are going to start coming.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.162
Smile and help me
to sell this place.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.663
[instrumental music]

19:23.697 --> 19:25.331
-<i>Hola.</i>Mwah!
- Mwah!

19:25.365 --> 19:26.499
You look phenomenal.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.168
My plan of attack
is very simple.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.536
First, I get them on the door.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.037
Luis. Nice to meet you.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.906
<i>Second, I get them</i>
<i>liquored up.</i>

19:32.939 --> 19:34.607
Thank you,<i>senorita. Salud.</i>

19:34.641 --> 19:37.410
And third,
I turn on the Latin charm.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.712
And I love your bag, by the way.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.879
Woman 2: Thank you.
- Boom!

19:39.913 --> 19:41.348
[laughs]

19:46.586 --> 19:48.054
[mumbles]

19:50.724 --> 19:52.392
Hey, it's Ryan.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.962
Um, just wondering if you're
still gonna be able to make it.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.397
<i>Ryan: Hey, it's Ryan.</i>

19:57.430 --> 19:59.432
<i>I know we had talked about, uh,</i>

19:59.466 --> 20:03.269
<i>you coming to the open house.</i>

20:03.303 --> 20:06.039
This side right here, that's the
second bedroom or home office.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.742
You can't call it a bedroom
'cause there's no windows in it.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.311
Hey, it's Ryan.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.047
<i>Uh, it's just about 12 o'clock.</i>

20:14.080 --> 20:16.349
<i>Wondering if you're coming,</i>
<i>if you're on your way.</i>

20:16.383 --> 20:19.386
<i>Um, so gimme a call back,</i>
<i>please. Thank you.</i>

20:21.054 --> 20:22.322
<i>Salud.</i>

20:26.359 --> 20:27.460
Please, after you.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.200
* Oh bah bah **

20:34.234 --> 20:36.069
Hello?

20:36.102 --> 20:37.103
Hello?

20:38.471 --> 20:39.839
This doesn't make any sense.

20:39.873 --> 20:43.076
I had, I had, like,
over 70 people confirm

20:43.109 --> 20:45.445
to come to the open house.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.913
So now it's time for plan B.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.116
<i>And plan B is to go downstairs</i>
<i>to the other open house...</i>

20:51.251 --> 20:52.452
and drum up some business.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.555
Hello.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.358
Sweet!
It's like a party in here.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.060
It's kinda dark, though,
right?

21:00.060 --> 21:01.661
- Yeah.
- It's cool.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.464
I open the door
and what do I find?

21:04.497 --> 21:05.932
What's going on? Hello.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.133
A fiesta.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.803
Hey, why are you down here?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.571
With my clients.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.406
Oh, God, I am so hungry.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.377
I think that little [bleep],
uh, Luis,

21:17.410 --> 21:20.680
is pullin' a me on me.

21:22.082 --> 21:23.950
You do not steal my clients.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.519
I steal your clients.

21:26.553 --> 21:30.824
If you think you are going
to beat me at my own game,

21:30.857 --> 21:33.159
you have another thing comin',
<i>papi.</i>

21:35.195 --> 21:38.131
[upbeat music]

21:42.502 --> 21:45.438
- Hi, everybody.
- Hello.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.808
I spent $40,000
on all this marketing,

21:48.842 --> 21:50.710
$40,000.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.746
And no success.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.547
<i>Fredrik: It is time</i>
<i>to talk to my team.</i>

21:54.581 --> 21:58.451
So, um, I want to discuss
our favorite listing right now,

21:58.485 --> 22:00.186
the Marble House.

22:00.220 --> 22:02.155
And I just want to say,

22:02.188 --> 22:04.791
um, I feel a bit disappointed.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.826
I feel like
I'm very alone in all this.

22:06.860 --> 22:08.495
You know, the reason
why I started this team

22:08.528 --> 22:10.630
was to have support

22:10.663 --> 22:14.067
and to help me. We're doin'
everything, I don't know--

22:14.067 --> 22:15.702
- What do you expect us to do?
- What exactly are you doing?

22:15.735 --> 22:17.904
We're doing everything.
We've advertised in China.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.773
- We've advertised in--
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.342
I advertised in China.
I've done everything.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.710
What have you done?

22:26.780 --> 22:29.883
I don't know.
I mean, I spent $40,000.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.184
If I don't sell this,
I'm not gonna

22:31.217 --> 22:33.153
get that money back.
Do you understand?

22:33.186 --> 22:36.289
It's like it's a big hole
in the account right now.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.158
Who spends $40,000 on a listing?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.392
We really need
to lower the price.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.794
There's nothing else
we could do.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.228
- We can't beg people to buy it.
Fredrik: No, I resent that.

22:42.262 --> 22:44.698
I resent that. [stammers]
No, it's not happening.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.099
With seven days
left on the li...

22:46.099 --> 22:48.401
It's not happening, okay?

22:48.435 --> 22:49.769
People want a penthouse.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.639
They want to be higher,
not lower. That's the issue.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.175
And if the price
isn't adjusted...

22:55.208 --> 22:56.910
[thuds]

22:56.943 --> 23:00.046
I cannot say it in
any other way, you understand?

23:00.080 --> 23:01.715
Seriously, that's not
what a top broker does.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.249
That's not what we do
in this team.

23:03.283 --> 23:05.585
We don't lower the price
all the time.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.887
That's not me.

23:10.123 --> 23:13.059
It's like my brain is resetting
every five seconds.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.895
Marble House, Marble House,
Marble House.

23:15.929 --> 23:17.731
I can't think of anything else.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.265
I gotta get to work.

23:19.299 --> 23:23.370
I have to sell it.
I have to sell it.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.605
So, let's send out
the email blast again,

23:25.638 --> 23:27.774
4500 brokers,
international brokers.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.209
Let's do
the "New York Post" ad again.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.878
I'll spend another $5000, right?

23:31.911 --> 23:34.447
- In the next 24 hours, okay?
Ray: You got it.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.749
Let's do this.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.255
[instrumental music]

23:43.089 --> 23:44.991
[indistinct chatter]

23:47.227 --> 23:49.596
- Is that a band?
- You don't like?

23:49.629 --> 23:50.964
- Well, it's good.
- They're from Cuba.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.999
Can I offer you something?
Sangria, coquito?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.200
Oh, no, I'll just drink water.

23:54.234 --> 23:55.435
I don't drink alcohol
in the afternoon.

23:55.468 --> 23:56.670
Come on, man.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.405
<i>Ryan: This prick's</i>
<i>got a lot of nerve.</i>

23:58.438 --> 24:01.207
I walk into Luis' apartment
and see my clients.

24:01.241 --> 24:02.509
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.577
Aren't you supposed to be
at my open house?

24:04.611 --> 24:06.346
Why are you down here?

24:06.379 --> 24:08.048
What the [bleep]
is this guy doing?

24:08.048 --> 24:10.250
<i>Luis: This goddamn douchebag</i>
<i>is trying to steal clients</i>

24:10.283 --> 24:12.552
that came to my open house.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.586
Do you live in the building?

24:13.620 --> 24:14.854
- In 25 Broad?
- Yeah.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.122
- No, I've been there a year.
- Oh, cool.

24:16.156 --> 24:17.724
- Do you like it?
- It's good.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.959
Listen, when she comes
to your open house,

24:20.060 --> 24:21.528
then you do
whatever you have to do.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.064
When it's my open house,
she's here.

24:24.064 --> 24:26.499
Don't disrespect me.
Don't be a [bleep].

24:26.533 --> 24:30.437
Luis has the balls to accuse me
of stealing his clients

24:30.470 --> 24:32.605
after he steals my clients,

24:32.639 --> 24:34.240
and then he tries
to push me around?

24:34.274 --> 24:35.875
I mean, that's like a Chihuahua

24:35.909 --> 24:37.644
trying to get a jump
on a Great Dane.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.079
You're very feisty
for a little guy.

24:39.079 --> 24:40.914
Come on, have some
[bleep] class, bro.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.516
You're like, you're swearing
in front of clients.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.752
It's cool. We're good.
I like the hair.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.387
- Thank you very much.
- Good luck. See you, guys.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.294
Don't [bleep]
with a Puerto Rican.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.730
Can you put the music up,
please?

24:56.763 --> 24:57.997
A little better.
Please, everybody.

<i>Luis' apartment,</i>

25:01.868 --> 25:03.403
<i>I am not worried.</i>

25:03.436 --> 25:05.372
Once my clients get tired

25:05.405 --> 25:08.441
of feeling their way around
Luis' dark, little apartment,

25:08.475 --> 25:11.244
I'll be upstairs,

Have you ever been
with a Puerto Rican before?

37:41.361 --> 37:42.729
Yes. No.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.564
I think every woman has to be
with a Puerto Rican.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.199
- Okay.
- At some point in their life.

37:46.232 --> 37:48.535
At least a Puerto Rican kiss.
It's the first one you ever had.

37:48.568 --> 37:50.770
- What's a Puerto Rican kiss?
- Trust me, it's good.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.172
Puerto Rican kiss.

38:00.313 --> 38:02.015
It's Puerto Rican,
but it's romantic.

No, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, you--

39:11.351 --> 39:13.687
Heather, all you need to do
is to bring them in

39:13.720 --> 39:15.822

a, like, a walk-through

39:15.855 --> 39:17.323

how amazing it is.
