I love you.

<i>Previously on Scandal...</i>

00:05.433 --> 00:06.525
They're talking about you, Amanda.

00:06.635 --> 00:08.432
Everyone's gonna be talking about you.

00:08.536 --> 00:10.835
I never dreamed
I'd be listening to a tape of you

00:10.940 --> 00:12.373
moaning with a White House aide.

00:12.508 --> 00:13.806
Amanda Tanner is blackmailing you.

00:13.943 --> 00:16.207
Which means that
Olivia Pope is blackmailing you.

00:16.312 --> 00:17.974
I need to know
if you have any proof

00:18.081 --> 00:19.674
of what went on
with you and the President.

00:20.118 --> 00:21.244
I'm pregnant.

You know what's interesting
about being engaged?

00:44.347 --> 00:46.679
Fiancées don't like it
when you get out of bed at 3:00 a. m.

00:46.849 --> 00:49.341
To go see another woman.
But you called, I came,

00:49.453 --> 00:51.284
and I brought our best friend Shiraz.

00:54.426 --> 00:56.189
Liv?

01:01.534 --> 01:02.728
Hey, Liv.

01:05.138 --> 01:06.969
Hey. I got it.

01:10.078 --> 01:12.205
Amanda's asleep in the guest room.
I don't want to wake her.

01:13.381 --> 01:16.977
Tell me. Whatever it is, we will fix it.

01:36.342 --> 01:38.640
You should have seen me forcing water
down her throat to make her pee.

01:38.745 --> 01:40.236
It was like something out of Abu Ghraib.

01:42.216 --> 01:43.877
Let me get this clear,
Amanda Tanner is...

01:43.984 --> 01:45.714
Pregnant with
the President's baby, yes.

01:49.057 --> 01:51.788
Right. Are you sure it's his?

01:52.895 --> 01:53.919
- I'm sure.
- Liv!

01:54.029 --> 01:55.657
I'm sure.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.137
How bad is this for you?

02:01.305 --> 02:03.136
I know you're friends with the President,
with his wife.

02:03.241 --> 02:06.268
There's no shame
in saying you can't handle this.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.779
- What?
- You'd better come down to the office.

02:15.890 --> 02:16.857
There's an army here.

02:16.957 --> 02:18.652
An army of what? Reporters? Lawyers?

02:18.793 --> 02:20.125
An actual army.

02:22.230 --> 02:23.356
Liv.

02:23.465 --> 02:25.093
We got to go in.

02:25.234 --> 02:27.532
I need to put on some decent clothes,
and we'll take your car,

02:27.637 --> 02:29.434
because I think
I've had too much wine to drive.

02:30.073 --> 02:31.540
- I'll be ready in two minutes.
- Liv.

02:31.642 --> 02:36.580
No, I'm fine. Really. I'm good now.
I can handle anything. Two minutes.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.182
I didn't know. They barged in,
they wouldn't even say who they were.

02:42.288 --> 02:43.346
You were alone. You did the right thing.

02:43.456 --> 02:45.425
I should've stopped them.
I just surrendered.

02:45.525 --> 02:47.493
Without a fight,
I surrendered the whole office.

02:47.961 --> 02:49.326
Who's speaking at the OAS,
who's in town?

02:49.429 --> 02:50.419
OAS?

02:50.531 --> 02:52.795
Organization of American States.
Annual conference this week.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.458
Bolivia, Brazil, Haiti, Honduras.

02:54.569 --> 02:56.504
You think it's the Cubans?
They've been wooing us for months.

02:56.605 --> 02:58.232
- Would you like me to get a gun?
- You have a gun?

02:58.340 --> 03:00.036
- I have one, too.
- No guns!

03:06.383 --> 03:08.374
- You gave them coffee?
- So they wouldn't kill me.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.992
<i>Of course. El General,</i>

03:22.102 --> 03:24.161
<i>- Who is it?
- General Benicio Florez.</i>

03:24.271 --> 03:27.139
Otherwise known as ruthless,
repressive, political freedom-hating,

03:27.242 --> 03:30.076
police brutality-loving,
South American leftist dictator.

03:30.179 --> 03:32.545
And sworn enemy of the United States.

<i>sync and corrections by majtjkong</i>

03:38.889 --> 03:42.326
My wife and my two youngest children
were kidnapped.

03:42.493 --> 03:44.427
Taken from a restaurant this afternoon
at Dupont Circle.

03:44.562 --> 03:47.191
My oldest son, Felipe,
saw them being pulled away in a van.

03:47.299 --> 03:48.323
Is the FBI on it?

03:48.433 --> 03:49.923
The FBI probably did this!

03:50.203 --> 03:51.727
Look, the only reason
I'm even in this country

03:51.838 --> 03:53.305
is because of this OAS conference.

03:53.406 --> 03:55.500
Half of my security detail
was sent away at the airport.

03:55.876 --> 03:57.468
Does that give you an idea

03:57.578 --> 03:59.603
of what kind of cooperation
I'm gonna get from this government?

03:59.813 --> 04:01.714
They've been trying
to overthrow him for years.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.716
I know that
in the eyes of your President,

04:05.821 --> 04:07.413
I am somewhere
between Castro and Gaddafi.

04:07.790 --> 04:13.787
But before I am a so-called dictator,
before I am a general, I am a husband.

04:13.897 --> 04:15.627
I am a father.

04:18.002 --> 04:22.372
And I need to have my family safe.
I will do anything to see them again.

04:22.775 --> 04:24.743
You are my best and my only chance.

04:30.116 --> 04:32.278
Tell me we're not going
to take on a dictator as a client.

04:32.386 --> 04:33.353
They're just talking.

04:33.454 --> 04:35.480
You don't talk for that long
if you're not gonna take somebody on.

04:35.591 --> 04:36.853
You do if the elevator hasn't come.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.120
Exactly. She's just being polite.

04:39.227 --> 04:40.661
It doesn't mean
she's going to represent him.

04:40.930 --> 04:42.124
That does.

04:42.231 --> 04:44.791
<i>Welcome to Olivia Pope
and Associates, El General,</i>

04:45.001 --> 04:47.493
Your delightful death squads
are now our delightful death squads.

04:47.605 --> 04:49.937
The man does not have death squads.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.508
Come on,
we used to vote on this stuff!

04:51.610 --> 04:54.135
And now, apparently,
we don't even get to speak.

04:54.379 --> 04:57.941
Stephen, Abby, first thing
in the morning, talk to the older son.

04:58.050 --> 05:01.145
Huck, Harrison, see if you can dig up
any eyewitnesses at the restaurant.

05:01.254 --> 05:02.516
- So we're taking the case?
- What?

05:02.623 --> 05:05.148
Your good friend, the General.
We're taking him on as a client?

05:05.325 --> 05:06.350
Even though we didn't vote.

05:06.461 --> 05:08.156
Even though the rest of us
didn't have a say.

05:13.936 --> 05:16.030
We need to cut Olivia
some serious slack, right now.

05:17.207 --> 05:18.731
Amanda Tanner is pregnant.

05:29.688 --> 05:30.849
- Hello, James.
- It's Sunday.

05:30.957 --> 05:31.946
- Good to see you.
- It's Sunday.

05:32.058 --> 05:33.025
I don't get a hug anymore?

05:33.126 --> 05:34.218
- Not on Sunday.
- I'll be quick.

05:34.327 --> 05:36.592
I am trying to keep him
from dropping dead of a heart attack.

05:36.697 --> 05:38.096
A heart attack
brought on by people like you.

05:38.198 --> 05:39.392
I just need five minutes.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.298
Coming by here and thinking
he's gonna work on a Sunday.

05:41.403 --> 05:44.236
No. He doesn't work on Sunday.
Unless there's a war. Is there a war?

05:44.372 --> 05:46.773
Somewhere in the world,
there's always a war.

05:50.346 --> 05:52.474
When my husband's dead,
I'm blaming you.

05:59.157 --> 06:02.423
I'm surprised
James let you in on a Sunday.

06:02.594 --> 06:04.926
Things are bad. He's in trouble, Cyrus.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.192
This is real.
Amanda Tanner is pregnant.

06:10.103 --> 06:14.165
I need to know if he, maybe,
took precautions with Amanda.

06:14.275 --> 06:17.905
You want to know if the President
wore condoms when he slept around?

06:18.046 --> 06:22.040
I don't know, I think that's your area.
Did he wear one with you?

06:25.188 --> 06:27.783
- How much?
- I could probably sell ten million.

06:27.891 --> 06:29.324
- Over five years.
- Over three.

06:29.426 --> 06:30.586
I'll see what I can do.

06:32.697 --> 06:36.099
You and I aren't friends anymore.
Don't come here again.

06:40.874 --> 06:43.707
You told Cyrus Beene
that I was pregnant,

06:43.810 --> 06:45.607
and he still won't let me
see the President?

06:45.712 --> 06:47.374
Amanda, I need you to focus.

06:47.582 --> 06:50.107
They're talking about $ 10 million
dollars, that could buy you a lot.

06:50.218 --> 06:51.447
That could buy you a life.

06:51.553 --> 06:53.111
I just think
if you could get them to reconsider,

06:53.222 --> 06:55.588
if I have a chance to just sit
with the President for five minutes.

06:55.691 --> 06:57.159
I don't understand
why this is happening,

06:57.260 --> 06:59.751
why they won't let me see him.
I need a moment,

06:59.863 --> 07:02.389
just a moment to talk to him, if I had
a moment, if we were alone...

07:02.500 --> 07:04.229
- Amanda...
- Just five minutes alone!

07:04.335 --> 07:05.997
How hard is that? I can just...

07:06.104 --> 07:08.231
They put me in a chair
outside of his office,

07:08.340 --> 07:11.139
and I wait, I wait until he has a break,
some kind of break in his schedule...

07:11.310 --> 07:13.403
Amanda! That isn't going to happen.

07:13.813 --> 07:15.542
Don't you understand that?

07:15.681 --> 07:18.674
He is the most powerful man
on the planet

07:18.886 --> 07:23.256
and you are a threat to that power,
you are a threat to his government.

07:23.458 --> 07:26.553
You are never, ever going to be
in the same room with the President,

07:26.662 --> 07:30.564
much less alone with him, ever again.

07:30.666 --> 07:34.899
So if you don't want money,
you need to decide what you do want.

07:35.572 --> 07:38.770
And I am not asking for your fairy tale
hopes and your princess dreams.

07:38.876 --> 07:42.608
The fairy tale is over, Amanda.
You have a child to consider.

07:42.714 --> 07:45.182
So I need to know
what you want that is real.

07:45.284 --> 07:48.584
So what do you want?
Do you want to keep this baby?

07:48.788 --> 07:51.314
Do you want to have an abortion?
Do you want to give it up for adoption?

07:51.425 --> 07:53.393
What do you want?

07:57.799 --> 07:59.232
I want to keep this baby.

07:59.334 --> 08:00.665
Okay.

08:01.704 --> 08:05.299
And I wanna tell the world what he did.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.175
He told me he loved me.

08:08.378 --> 08:10.938
He told me to trust him,
that he'd take care of me.

08:11.181 --> 08:13.810
And now
he won't even take five minutes to...

08:14.085 --> 08:18.887
And they think I'm just gonna go away,
just like that? I trusted him, I...

08:19.892 --> 08:21.325
He should burn for this.

08:21.461 --> 08:22.450
Amanda...

08:22.562 --> 08:27.865
You're asking me what I want?
I want them all to burn for this.

08:37.447 --> 08:41.611
Olivia? You look great.
New lipstick? It's working.

08:41.719 --> 08:43.015
So, you know the old guy who runs

08:43.120 --> 08:45.213
the newsstand on the corner
of C Street and Constitution?

08:45.322 --> 08:48.224
I buy my paper and coffee there
every day, for 11 years.

08:48.326 --> 08:51.124
This place is my ritual,
my personal landmark.

08:51.229 --> 08:53.289
And these vulture developers
want to knock it down,

08:53.399 --> 08:56.027
and I want you to save it
by horse-trading, or threatening,

08:56.135 --> 08:59.071
or getting it put on the National
Register of Historic Newsstands,

08:59.172 --> 09:00.730
or whatever it is you people do.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.139
Olivia?

09:13.523 --> 09:15.047
- Is she...
- I got this.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.767
What do you need?

09:23.035 --> 09:26.232
Just one minute.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.645
It's a good speech.

09:40.755 --> 09:43.224
It's the same speech
every president has given at the OAS

09:43.326 --> 09:46.420
for the past 40 years.
I'm pretty sure things have changed

09:46.529 --> 09:48.691
since the Cuban Revolution,
and I'm giving the same speech.

09:48.799 --> 09:49.891
It's a great speech.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.695
I bet Eisenhower thought so
when he wrote it,

09:51.802 --> 09:53.532
but I'd like to say something
a little more original.

09:53.638 --> 09:55.731
We employ the best speech writers
in the western world.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.101
Are there better ones
in the eastern world?

09:57.209 --> 09:58.904
Nobody likes a smart ass,
Mr. President.

09:59.011 --> 10:01.343
Mr. B. They're ready for you, sir.

10:01.613 --> 10:04.708
I'll put JP and Sally
on writing you a new speech, okay?

10:04.818 --> 10:06.376
Now if you'll excuse me.

10:07.989 --> 10:09.320
Anything new on the Olivia front?

10:09.423 --> 10:11.152
Nothing I can't handle, Mr. President.

10:16.565 --> 10:19.399
Billy, I don't have a lot of time.

10:19.569 --> 10:20.729
Well, let's get right to it, then.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.999
Cyrus, meet Sanders Black.
Sanders, Cyrus Beene.

10:23.107 --> 10:24.802
The President's Chief of Staff
needs no introduction.

10:24.908 --> 10:27.241
I know that you've signed
confidentiality agreements

10:27.345 --> 10:29.609
and been briefed
on the sensitive nature of this meeting.

10:29.714 --> 10:32.445
But I'm going to take a moment
to remind you

10:32.551 --> 10:33.643
that I will personally make sure

10:33.753 --> 10:36.313
you never ever work again
within the borders of this fine nation

10:36.422 --> 10:38.983
if you breathe a word
or the edge of a word outside this room.

10:39.092 --> 10:40.423
Now, I'm a busy man. Let's go.

10:40.527 --> 10:41.789
Good. Got it.

10:43.531 --> 10:44.930
Okay, then.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.497
When I'm investigating someone,
I leave no stone unturned.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.868
I want to know where they come from.
I want to know what they've done.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.236
Where do they go? Who do they see?
Have they made mistakes?

10:53.410 --> 10:58.007
Do they have debts? Enemies?
Do they drink, smoke, snort, shoot?

10:58.549 --> 11:01.040
If any one of them
has so much as even a parking ticket,

11:01.252 --> 11:02.652
I will find out about it.

11:02.754 --> 11:05.951
This group, here, hiding a lot more
than just parking tickets.

11:11.931 --> 11:13.422
Let's start with Olivia Pope.

11:23.212 --> 11:25.874
Carolina Florez.
Cuban born, Boston raised.

11:26.082 --> 11:27.550
She was a waitress at a Harvard bar,

11:27.651 --> 11:29.983
when she met a cute undergrad
named Benicio.

11:30.087 --> 11:32.522
Or as I like to call him,
the Butcher of San Miguel.

11:32.623 --> 11:33.612
Abby...

11:33.724 --> 11:35.351
They fell in love, got married,

11:35.493 --> 11:37.256
he brought her back with him
to his home country.

11:37.463 --> 11:41.263
They had three kids, lived happily
ever after in their little dictatorship,

11:41.567 --> 11:44.765
until last night. When,
according to their oldest son, Felipe...

11:44.871 --> 11:46.634
They were in the bathroom a long time.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.298
I went to check and then saw them
out of the back.

11:49.477 --> 11:53.812
The men, they pushed them in a van,
and I ran inside for help.

11:53.915 --> 11:55.610
Restaurant bathroom window
was smashed.

11:55.717 --> 11:57.082
Glass everywhere. Signs of a struggle.

11:57.252 --> 11:58.242
But then we went out back.

12:02.726 --> 12:04.660
Unless they had
the world's smallest van...

12:07.599 --> 12:08.566
There was no way out of there.

12:08.666 --> 12:11.692
At least not how the kid says he saw it.
What about other witnesses?

12:12.504 --> 12:13.563
I didn't hear anything.

12:13.672 --> 12:16.368
All I know is they were gone and the
older kid was still here. Freaked out.

12:16.575 --> 12:18.066
Anything strange happen at the table?

12:19.012 --> 12:21.480
Just a normal lunch.
She had a lot of iced tea.

12:21.581 --> 12:23.516
The little boy, cute, maybe seven?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.711
He played with one
of those electronic game thingy's.

12:25.853 --> 12:27.286
What kind? What model? What year?

12:27.421 --> 12:28.514
Focus, fanboy.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.717
I don't know. It was white?

12:32.694 --> 12:34.094
So yeah, basically, we have nothing.

12:34.197 --> 12:36.529
This doesn't add up. We need
to keep digging, look for a motive,

12:36.733 --> 12:38.702
political opposition, maybe, or...

12:38.936 --> 12:40.028
- I got a signal.
- What?

12:40.137 --> 12:42.230
The kid's Gen9 SD is wi-fi enabled.

12:42.339 --> 12:44.137
Fanboy here, tracked the IP address

12:44.242 --> 12:46.176
that the dynamic host
configuration protocol

12:46.444 --> 12:48.276
assigned to the ARM9 processor,

12:48.381 --> 12:51.282
and was then able to ping
the server's geolocation vector.

12:51.517 --> 12:52.575
English, Huck.

12:52.718 --> 12:54.880
I found the toy,
which means I found them.

12:57.558 --> 12:59.186
Go now, get her.

12:59.327 --> 13:02.558
Call David, see if he can get DC Metro
to send backup. Don't go in alone.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.669
Good thing you called.

13:13.778 --> 13:16.178
Wouldn't want you to have to
deal with all this on your own.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.977
I'll take the two nuns on the left,
you guys get the one with the baby.

13:25.225 --> 13:26.692
You think Huck got it wrong?

13:26.793 --> 13:28.193
Huck never gets it wrong.

13:28.996 --> 13:30.691
Then she wasn't kidnapped.

13:31.465 --> 13:32.454
She ran.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.066
What about this Huck character?
Is this really all there is?

13:41.177 --> 13:43.042
Well, Huck is obviously
not his real name.

13:43.146 --> 13:45.979
The CIA denies knowing him,
but they also sent three agents

13:46.083 --> 13:48.780
over to my office to encourage me
to stop checking into his background.

13:48.987 --> 13:52.047
So, clearly, he's one of theirs.
Other than that, he is a mystery.

13:52.156 --> 13:53.146
You have a guess?

13:53.259 --> 13:56.387
My guess is that if you meet this guy
in a dark alley, you're done.

13:57.296 --> 13:59.788
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew he would send someone.

13:59.899 --> 14:02.197
It was so stupid, I wasn't thinking.

14:02.636 --> 14:04.605
I took Paola and Manny
to the bathroom,

14:04.705 --> 14:08.665
and I saw the back door,
and I just started thinking, "This is it.

14:08.777 --> 14:11.940
"My security men are at the bar,
this is my chance. " So I took it.

14:12.047 --> 14:13.139
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

14:13.248 --> 14:14.546
Then why run?

14:15.351 --> 14:16.613
I don't love him anymore.

14:16.819 --> 14:20.051
Fifteen years ago,
I married a good man, a kind man,

14:20.224 --> 14:23.456
a man who looked at his country
and dreamed of ways to make it better.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.257
But now Benicio thinks
everyone's out to get him.

14:26.564 --> 14:28.259
You disagree with him, you disappear.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.660
You don't tell a man like that
you're unhappy.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.064
You don't ask a man like that
for a divorce.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.241
You don't leave a man like that.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.842
Abigail Whelan.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.276
Married for four years
to Charles Putney,

14:39.480 --> 14:42.643
the youngest son of former
Virginia governor, James Putney.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.311
She left him when he allegedly
beat her in a drunken rage.

14:45.688 --> 14:47.519
Divorce proceedings
are full of ugly details.

14:47.623 --> 14:48.750
It's all in your file.

14:49.492 --> 14:51.960
Your oldest son,
he said you were kidnapped.

14:52.062 --> 14:54.293
When I was in the bathroom,
wondering if I could do it,

14:54.432 --> 14:57.833
he came to look for me,
and when he saw me, he knew.

14:58.002 --> 14:59.095
He wouldn't come with you.

14:59.304 --> 15:03.365
He loves his father.
And I couldn't ask him to choose.

15:04.977 --> 15:06.774
I don't know.
It just all happened so quickly.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.850
I guess you have to take me
back to my husband now.

15:12.419 --> 15:15.981
No. We don't.

15:18.226 --> 15:19.956
- This is not a date.
- On the rocks with salt.

15:20.096 --> 15:22.360
I cannot date you. I work for Olivia Pope.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.690
<i>And the new girl?</i>

15:23.800 --> 15:26.394
Quinn Perkins.
Started less than four weeks ago.

15:26.536 --> 15:28.801
Left a cushy associate's gig
at O'Malley and Lee.

15:28.906 --> 15:29.998
Why is there nothing in her file?

15:30.308 --> 15:31.900
That's a good question.
We're still working on it.

15:32.009 --> 15:32.998
What's the problem?

15:33.111 --> 15:36.707
Well, as far as we know,
Quinn Perkins didn't exist until 2008.

15:37.449 --> 15:39.645
Quinn, I won't ask you
about Amanda Tanner.

15:39.753 --> 15:42.187
I won't use you for my story.
I don't need to.

15:42.288 --> 15:45.417
I like you. Okay? So relax.
Drink your margarita.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.223
- Wait, why?
- Why what?

15:53.335 --> 15:55.133
Why don't you need to use me
for a story about Amanda Tanner?

15:55.238 --> 15:56.535
Because I have another source.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.870
Harrison Wright?
Harrison Wright.

16:04.115 --> 16:06.583
28 years old, grew up right here in D.C.

16:06.684 --> 16:09.745
He somehow managed to go
from selling luxury cars in Takoma Park

16:09.855 --> 16:11.345
to working for Adnan Salif.

16:11.590 --> 16:12.818
Made a mountain of money,

16:12.925 --> 16:14.450
and managed to only get six months

16:14.561 --> 16:16.586
when Salif went down
for insider trading.

16:16.763 --> 16:17.787
How did he pull that off?

16:17.964 --> 16:20.456
Great lawyer.
Olivia Pope defended him pro bono.

16:21.269 --> 16:23.601
Hi. My sister and her kids
need a room for the night.

16:23.738 --> 16:25.570
Do you have something
with two double beds?

16:25.674 --> 16:26.868
Yes, we do.

16:27.843 --> 16:30.312
This is insane.
We need to tell Olivia we have her.

16:30.413 --> 16:31.971
We will tell her.
We just won't tell her till tomorrow.

16:32.215 --> 16:34.741
Or next day, at the latest.
As soon as we get her asylum.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.287
She's fried, Stephen.

16:37.388 --> 16:38.719
She's not wearing
the white hat anymore.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.121
I'm not lying.

16:42.027 --> 16:44.656
Olivia? Hey, it's me.

16:44.764 --> 16:45.788
Stephen's putting gas in the car.

16:47.099 --> 16:49.364
Yeah, she was at a shelter.
Pretty clear she wasn't kidnapped.

16:50.471 --> 16:53.531
We tried to talk to her, but they've
closed their doors for the night.

16:53.774 --> 16:57.108
Nobody can come or go.
We'll pick her up tomorrow.

16:57.879 --> 16:59.939
Yeah. Good night.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.508
There. Done and done.

17:03.552 --> 17:07.284
Stephen Finch. Scottish born,
became a U.S. Citizen in 1995,

17:07.457 --> 17:10.393
shortly after graduating first in his class
from Yale Law.

17:10.494 --> 17:12.929
Was the top litigator
at Chase and Howard, a real hotshot.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.224
But suffered a nervous breakdown

17:14.333 --> 17:17.097
in the middle of defending
the class action suit against Bromquest.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.294
The chemical manufacturer

17:18.403 --> 17:19.769
that poisoned all those kids
in West Virginia?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.032
Exactly. He spent two months

17:21.140 --> 17:24.007
recovering in a facility in Florida
before quitting the firm.

17:24.109 --> 17:27.137
Olivia Pope. What did you do?

17:27.248 --> 17:28.306
What are you talking about, Billy?

17:28.415 --> 17:32.853
Cyrus has called in Sanders Black.
On you.

17:33.154 --> 17:35.214
Sanders Black is a short, short man.

17:35.324 --> 17:37.189
So was Napoleon,
but he still did a lot of damage.

17:37.293 --> 17:38.385
Why are you telling me this, Billy?

17:38.494 --> 17:41.157
If you can just tell me what's going on,
I might be able to help you.

17:41.298 --> 17:43.027
I don't want to feel
like I'm betraying my own,

17:43.133 --> 17:45.068
but sooner or later, I have to fall in line.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.613
Olivia Pope for Cyrus Beene.

18:01.255 --> 18:03.450
You want to play hardball?
Forget the money.

18:03.558 --> 18:06.585
<i>We booked 20/20 instead.
We're sitting down with Diane Sawyer.</i>

18:08.263 --> 18:09.389
You take care, Billy.

18:10.733 --> 18:12.223
<i>These people, Liv fixed them,</i>

18:12.569 --> 18:14.800
<i>That makes them loyal,
they'll die for her,</i>

18:14.905 --> 18:17.465
<i>I need more,
Something I can work with, Do better,</i>

18:17.675 --> 18:18.903
They did find one thing.

18:19.009 --> 18:21.035
Olivia Pope had an affair
with someone on the campaign.

18:21.146 --> 18:23.341
Yeah, we don't have a name yet,
we will. Give me a day or two.

18:23.448 --> 18:24.574
That's not useful to us.

18:24.684 --> 18:26.811
Excuse me, it's a potential gold mine,

18:26.919 --> 18:29.217
because other than that, Olivia Pope
is purer than Mother Teresa.

18:29.322 --> 18:30.483
Gentlemen, I have a country to run.

18:30.591 --> 18:32.081
I'm not going to stand around
and debate with you.

18:32.192 --> 18:33.784
It's not useful to us. Move on.

18:36.598 --> 18:37.587
Move on.

18:46.776 --> 18:48.403
Shut it down.

18:48.511 --> 18:50.036
- I'm sorry?
- I saw you on your date last night.

18:50.147 --> 18:52.980
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're lying, which isn't the problem.

18:53.084 --> 18:54.210
The problem is you suck at it.

18:54.318 --> 18:55.911
Every time you do it, you look
like you're about to cry.

18:56.054 --> 18:57.180
You look like
you're about to cry right now.

18:57.289 --> 18:58.517
I am not going to.

18:58.724 --> 19:00.352
Now, you can keep seeing this guy,

19:00.460 --> 19:02.553
but there's gonna come a time
when you're gonna have to lie to him

19:02.662 --> 19:05.325
to protect a client,
and we don't lie to reporters,

19:05.432 --> 19:07.263
because once you do,
there's no going back.

19:07.368 --> 19:11.430
You've killed the one thing
you protect at all costs, your credibility.

19:11.539 --> 19:14.406
And not just your credibility,
my credibility, this firm's credibility.

19:14.509 --> 19:15.704
And that's not going to happen.

19:15.978 --> 19:19.915
So save yourself the trouble
and shut it down!

19:28.626 --> 19:32.222
Cyrus. I know JP and Sally
are probably crying in the hall,

19:32.331 --> 19:33.559
but I'm writing my own speech now.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.532
It's good, it's great,
I'll show it to you when I'm done.

19:35.635 --> 19:39.162
- Amanda Tanner is pregnant.
- What?

19:39.272 --> 19:41.605
The good news is,
Amanda doesn't want your money.

19:41.709 --> 19:44.007
She wants publicity. Also good?

19:44.111 --> 19:45.545
You don't have to worry
about that sex tape,

19:45.647 --> 19:46.875
because who needs a sex tape

19:46.982 --> 19:50.248
when you've got a fetus full
of Presidential DNA? It's a win-win.

19:50.353 --> 19:52.844
- It's not my baby.
- You just keep practicing that line.

19:52.955 --> 19:54.616
- You're going to be saying it a lot.
- Okay, what do we do?

19:54.724 --> 19:56.352
Next step. How do we fix this?

19:59.029 --> 20:01.157
- I don't know.
- Cyrus. I know you're upset,

20:01.266 --> 20:03.131
but we have to game plan this.
What's next?

20:03.234 --> 20:05.099
What's next? What's next?

20:05.304 --> 20:08.671
Okay, here's what happens next,
you resign from office now.

20:09.141 --> 20:13.272
Or Amanda goes on TV,
tells her sad, sordid tale,

20:13.480 --> 20:16.314
there are hearings, you're impeached,
and you're forced to resign from office.

20:16.718 --> 20:19.278
Your Vice President,
a moronic right-wing nutjob,

20:19.387 --> 20:21.879
who thinks the Tea Party
was founded to lower the yacht tax,

20:22.057 --> 20:25.789
and who also seems to not quite
understand that evolution isn't an idea,

20:25.929 --> 20:27.362
but an actual fact. But who cares?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.293
We won the scary states in the election.

20:29.399 --> 20:33.234
They'll have a party, now that
their grand wizard is President.

20:33.771 --> 20:35.399
I'm pretty sure
I'll never see a legal marriage

20:35.507 --> 20:37.270
and women will lose the right to choose.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.343
But, hey, whatever,
we're all Republicans,

20:39.444 --> 20:42.039
even if the new president
will give Republicans a bad name.

20:42.715 --> 20:45.047
You'll leave in disgrace,
go home to California,

20:45.151 --> 20:46.676
keep a low profile for a while,

20:46.787 --> 20:49.779
and then some fancy publishing house
will pay you a fortune for a book,

20:49.890 --> 20:51.381
which you'll write.
Only it won't talk about

20:51.493 --> 20:53.085
what everyone
really wants to know about.

20:53.194 --> 20:55.823
It won't talk about your sordid affair
with a White House aide.

20:55.965 --> 20:58.934
It'll talk about policy
and your thoughts on the economy.

20:59.101 --> 21:00.227
And it won't sell,

21:00.336 --> 21:01.702
because no one cares
about your thoughts

21:01.805 --> 21:03.170
on policy and the economy anymore.

21:03.273 --> 21:05.104
Because you're not
the President anymore.

21:05.275 --> 21:07.540
<i>What you are now is a joke,
on Letterman,</i>

21:08.312 --> 21:10.873
Mellie, a lovely woman,
ambitious and strong,

21:10.983 --> 21:12.473
and well, quite wealthy in her own right.

21:12.584 --> 21:15.782
She's not going to be circa 1998 Hillary
on this, no siree.

21:15.889 --> 21:17.117
This is the 21 st century.

21:17.223 --> 21:19.691
She's going to leave you, and she's
going to take your children with her.

21:19.793 --> 21:20.886
And everyone will applaud her

21:20.995 --> 21:22.587
from the religious right
to the women's groups.

21:22.696 --> 21:25.028
Because you're a philandering pig
who had a child out of wedlock

21:25.132 --> 21:27.431
and we all know it's true,
because we heard the tape.

21:28.103 --> 21:29.968
You'll be alone in your house
in Santa Barbara,

21:30.205 --> 21:33.198
listening to old records and telling
the same story, over and over again,

21:33.309 --> 21:34.742
to the poor sap not smart enough

21:34.844 --> 21:37.143
to get out of being assigned
to your Secret Service detail.

21:37.514 --> 21:40.210
Then one day,
about three or four years from now,

21:40.317 --> 21:41.615
you'll step into your bathroom,

21:41.719 --> 21:43.744
take out that revolver
your father gave you

21:43.855 --> 21:45.083
when you were elected governor,

21:45.190 --> 21:47.751
you'll put it in your mouth and
you'll blow the back of your skull off.

21:51.198 --> 21:52.324
Oprah's retired now,

21:52.432 --> 21:55.367
so I guess I have to do a post-funeral
interview with Barbara Walters.

21:55.468 --> 21:57.869
She's nice.

21:57.972 --> 22:04.208
But, you know, you just go back
to writing your own speech.

22:04.313 --> 22:07.681
That's important.
That matters.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.958
We'll be filing a petition
to determine the paternity of your child

22:18.063 --> 22:22.262
in D.C. Superior Court, after which
there will be a hearing and a DNA test.

22:22.368 --> 22:25.303
The petition is public,
which is going to set things in motion.

22:25.873 --> 22:27.431
That same day
you'll be taping an interview

22:27.541 --> 22:29.099
<i>with Diane Sawyer for 20/20,</i>

22:29.209 --> 22:30.733
- Diane Sawyer?
- Don't worry.

22:30.844 --> 22:32.278
We'll be doing mock interviews

22:32.380 --> 22:34.541
to prepare you for the kinds
of questions you will be asked.

22:34.649 --> 22:36.083
We don't want any surprises.

22:36.185 --> 22:38.176
If you're properly prepared,
you've got nothing to be afraid of.

22:38.287 --> 22:40.312
You need to call your parents
and all your friends.

22:40.422 --> 22:42.687
Warn them
about what's going to happen.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.260
Your parents will want to check
into a hotel when the interview airs,

22:45.362 --> 22:48.161
because their street
will be chock-full of reporters,

22:48.266 --> 22:51.828
and they won't be well behaved.
I know this seems scary.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.537
I know it's overwhelming,

22:53.772 --> 22:56.867
but we are talking about
the President of the United States.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.876
You want to burn down his house,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.741
you're going to have to
burn down your own as well.

23:02.983 --> 23:04.211
Livvie.

23:12.028 --> 23:13.427
Clearly, you were busy before.

23:13.529 --> 23:15.258
It was obviously not the right time
to ask for a favor,

23:15.364 --> 23:19.324
but I do have a favor to ask,
and keep in mind you owe me, big time.

23:19.436 --> 23:22.270
Sort of how I owe six cops
from ERT double overtime

23:22.373 --> 23:25.240
for showing up at a church
ready to blow holes in 30 nuns.

23:25.343 --> 23:26.936
And one way in which I'd like to cash in

23:27.046 --> 23:29.844
on what's becoming a truly massive
favor deficit between us,

23:29.949 --> 23:31.349
is for you to help out
an old friend of mine.

23:31.518 --> 23:32.542
- David.
- Yes?

23:32.752 --> 23:34.743
I did not answer you
when you asked me about this earlier.

23:34.854 --> 23:37.380
That was rude.
This time, I will be more clear.

23:37.491 --> 23:40.858
I have far, far more important things
to worry about, right now,

23:40.962 --> 23:43.523
than the fate of the crappy newsstand
you buy your morning coffee at.

23:43.632 --> 23:46.329
And I do not have time for this,
or for you.

23:46.436 --> 23:48.063
Bill me for the police overtime.

23:54.979 --> 23:57.642
Hi, excuse me.
I checked someone in yesterday,

23:57.749 --> 23:59.910
my sister and her two young children,
Room 402?

24:00.018 --> 24:04.115
Okay, let's see, Room 402 is vacant.

24:11.532 --> 24:13.159
You in trouble.

24:20.676 --> 24:24.545
We will. We will.

24:24.647 --> 24:26.639
Oh, Abby, good.

24:26.751 --> 24:28.082
I was just telling the General

24:28.185 --> 24:30.585
<i>that it was you and Stephen
that found señora Florez.</i>

24:31.222 --> 24:32.349
I cannot thank you enough.

24:32.524 --> 24:34.754
There were moments when I thought
I would never see them again.

24:34.993 --> 24:36.460
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:36.963 --> 24:38.487
We think the kidnappers
may have been allied

24:38.598 --> 24:41.396
with the General's political enemies.
Possibly the exile community.

24:41.501 --> 24:44.198
Anyway, thank goodness,
whoever it was lost their nerve,

24:44.304 --> 24:45.999
dropped Carolina and the children off
at that shelter,

24:46.106 --> 24:47.904
and now here they are, safe and sound.

24:48.877 --> 24:50.139
Safe and sound.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.790
You had no right
to do what you did.

25:03.895 --> 25:06.625
- No right? No right?
- That woman was not our client.

25:06.799 --> 25:08.198
She had one shot, and you took it away.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.825
She chose to marry that man.
She chose to have children with him.

25:10.936 --> 25:12.666
And that makes it your call
to decide whether...

25:12.772 --> 25:14.034
And now, 20 years later, she wakes up

25:14.140 --> 25:16.108
and realizes she's sleeping
next to a monster and she wants out?

25:16.209 --> 25:17.939
Are you kidding me?
That's what you did for me?

25:18.045 --> 25:19.376
She fell in love with the wrong man!

25:19.513 --> 25:21.504
No, you made the wrong call.
When I wanted to leave Charles...

25:21.615 --> 25:23.015
She put herself
in an impossible position!

25:23.118 --> 25:24.346
When I wanted to leave Charles...

25:24.453 --> 25:27.423
I did what I had to do for my client!
I made a tough call.

25:27.523 --> 25:31.961
You don't like it, Abby, too bad!
It is my name on that door, not yours!

25:32.196 --> 25:34.858
When I wanted to leave Charles!

25:36.400 --> 25:40.497
Don't talk to me about tough calls
and names on the door.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.039
That woman needs us.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.574
And I don't know
what's going on with you,

25:43.676 --> 25:44.836
or what's happened to you,

25:45.044 --> 25:47.138
but I know that you have your stuff
that you don't talk about.

25:47.347 --> 25:50.339
I know that.
But something's going on with you.

25:50.450 --> 25:52.351
And I'm sorry about that, I am.

25:52.453 --> 25:55.445
But that doesn't mean
that you get to stop being Olivia Pope!

25:56.691 --> 25:59.923
When Charles fractured
three of my ribs and broke my jaw,

26:00.028 --> 26:02.327
and threw me out into the snow
in my nightgown,

26:02.565 --> 26:05.966
Olivia Pope took a tire iron
and broke his kneecap.

26:06.202 --> 26:10.162
And then Olivia got me
the best divorce attorney in the state,

26:10.274 --> 26:13.073
and got me out of that marriage.
That's what Olivia does.

26:13.411 --> 26:16.346
That's who you are.
You are the gladiator.

26:16.515 --> 26:20.418
I would gladly follow you over a cliff.
But you've gotta show up.

26:20.653 --> 26:21.745
You gotta be a warrior.

26:21.854 --> 26:24.847
You don't get to pick and choose
when the real Olivia Pope

26:24.958 --> 26:26.482
walks through that door.

26:27.495 --> 26:29.395
You made the wrong call.

26:34.103 --> 26:39.974
Saltines, ginger ale,
every trashy magazine on the rack.

26:40.076 --> 26:43.342
Let me know if you need anything else.
I've gotta get back to the office.

26:43.981 --> 26:45.448
Dirt floors and mud walls.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.514
- I'm sorry?
- My senior year of college

26:47.619 --> 26:49.678
I saw this picture in a magazine.

26:49.788 --> 26:53.156
This little school
in India or Nepal, maybe.

26:53.259 --> 26:56.888
Dirt floors and mud walls, and sad
little wood benches instead of desks.

26:57.096 --> 27:00.191
It's the saddest thing I'd ever seen,
but what was even sadder,

27:00.367 --> 27:03.269
there were no girls in the picture.
Just boys.

27:03.371 --> 27:06.966
Because girls
weren't allowed to go to school.

27:07.075 --> 27:10.204
That's why I came to Washington.
Not to get knocked up.

27:10.313 --> 27:15.547
Just so you don't think
I'm some dumb bimbo slut who...

27:15.652 --> 27:19.350
There are places in the world
where girls don't get educated.

27:19.524 --> 27:21.355
Simply because they are girls.

27:28.034 --> 27:32.061
You can still do it.
Whatever you came here to do.

27:33.674 --> 27:35.232
This doesn't have to be your story.

27:41.283 --> 27:46.085
<i>We have withstood lies
spread by powerful media outlets,</i>

27:46.189 --> 27:48.988
<i>and the permanent threat
of this capitalist empire,</i>

27:49.093 --> 27:52.358
<i>We have withstood the very naked
disrespect for the sovereignty...</i>

27:52.463 --> 27:54.728
If you still want asylum,
we can get it for you.

27:54.833 --> 27:56.596
I have a car downstairs, waiting,

27:56.701 --> 27:58.329
ready to take you and your family
to Homeland Security.

27:58.437 --> 27:59.961
But if you want to go,
we have to leave right now,

28:00.072 --> 28:01.801
this minute. Do you still want asylum?

28:01.907 --> 28:03.535
My husband's security men
are down the hall.

28:03.644 --> 28:06.078
- They won't let me leave the building.
- We've got it covered.

28:06.179 --> 28:08.546
If she wants to go, you can't stop her.

28:08.650 --> 28:10.948
Now, we can talk INA code 101,
Section A-42,

28:11.052 --> 28:12.542
you guys familiar with that?

28:13.122 --> 28:15.920
Okay, let me break it down for you.
Asylum given for foreign-born spouses,

28:16.058 --> 28:19.995
subject to persecution, or well-founded
fear of persecution on account of race,

28:20.096 --> 28:22.861
religion, nationality,
membership in particular social group,

28:22.967 --> 28:25.629
or as pertains to our case here,
political opinion.

28:25.736 --> 28:29.605
So, you can object, petition, protest,
make yourself a nuisance all you want,

28:29.708 --> 28:32.268
but in case you haven't noticed,
she's on American soil.

28:32.377 --> 28:36.075
Otherwise known as,
"You have no jurisdiction here!"

28:38.352 --> 28:40.479
Liv, we need to move. Now.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.324
- Okay.
- Huck. Baby.

28:44.426 --> 28:48.227
Thank you. Manuel, wake up.
Manuel, we have to go. Come on.

28:48.331 --> 28:50.993
- Huck?
I dropped the pacifier.

28:51.834 --> 28:56.135
Take your toy. Thank you.
Come on. Felipe?

29:08.421 --> 29:11.549
General Florez.
What a wonderful speech,

29:11.658 --> 29:13.718
I was just coming by
to congratulate you.

29:16.263 --> 29:17.321
No.

29:22.537 --> 29:28.739
Benicio, she was helping me
to leave you. There was no kidnapping.

29:28.846 --> 29:31.906
There were no men.
There was no van. I left on my own.

29:32.015 --> 29:34.746
I left you because I wanted to leave you.

29:34.853 --> 29:36.878
I left you
because I don't love you anymore.

29:47.267 --> 29:50.965
Fine. Then leave.

29:51.072 --> 29:53.097
But you are not taking the children.
They're coming home with me.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.068
Benicio, please.

29:57.179 --> 29:58.511
<i>No, Carolina, mira</i>

30:05.723 --> 30:08.625
No. No, no, no. No! No!

30:12.297 --> 30:15.665
No. No.

31:03.726 --> 31:04.886
The kids and I were thinking

31:05.027 --> 31:06.892
we could all go to Santa Barbara
for the long weekend.

31:06.996 --> 31:08.726
They really want to see their friends.

31:08.832 --> 31:10.561
And we haven't been home
since the Inauguration.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.862
What's that, 14, 15 months?

31:16.007 --> 31:17.031
Fitz?

31:19.578 --> 31:22.308
- Would it be so bad if all this ended?
- What?

31:22.414 --> 31:24.383
I wanted to help people,
that was the point.

31:24.484 --> 31:28.420
I got in this job to help people,
not for the job.

31:28.522 --> 31:30.923
I could find better ways to effect change.

31:32.727 --> 31:34.059
What's going on? What happened?

31:38.367 --> 31:41.804
Would it be so bad? If this ended?

31:43.773 --> 31:47.073
Yes, it would be so bad if this ended.
It would be catastrophic.

31:48.379 --> 31:50.507
Now pull yourself together, damn it.
You've got a speech to give.

31:58.324 --> 31:59.952
We'll go to Santa Barbara
later in the year,

32:00.060 --> 32:02.790
or maybe for Christmas.

32:11.574 --> 32:16.740
It's me.
I'm done, I can't do this anymore.

32:16.846 --> 32:21.045
I can't lie anymore. I'm out.
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

32:24.623 --> 32:29.026
And today I say
to all citizens of the Americas,

32:29.128 --> 32:33.121
democracy is your destiny.

32:33.232 --> 32:37.135
I call upon my fellow leaders
to stand together

32:37.237 --> 32:42.369
and to speak with one voice,
loud, clear and strong,

32:42.611 --> 32:46.605
so General Florez, President Chàvez,
and President Castro,

32:46.716 --> 32:49.845
all those who would seek to squash
individual rights and freedoms,

32:49.953 --> 32:51.215
may hear us.

32:51.388 --> 32:56.088
Your time has passed.

33:08.942 --> 33:13.437
The way I see it,
all roads lead back to Amanda Tanner.

33:13.547 --> 33:16.278
She's saying we had an affair,
she's saying she's carrying my child.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.580
Without her,
there's nothing but that tape.

33:18.687 --> 33:21.680
Without her, that tape is just a guy
who sounds vaguely like me.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.351
There's no proof.
Nobody even takes that tape seriously

33:24.461 --> 33:25.450
without it being vouched for,

33:25.562 --> 33:27.462
which means our problem
is Amanda Tanner.

33:27.564 --> 33:29.031
And she's not our problem, she's a kid.

33:29.567 --> 33:32.195
Our real problem is Olivia Pope.

33:34.573 --> 33:37.838
- You realize...
- I got into this job to help people.

33:38.544 --> 33:39.842
To change this country for the better.

33:40.847 --> 33:45.285
I am the President
of the United States of America.

33:45.653 --> 33:47.018
It's time I acted like it.

33:48.423 --> 33:51.916
Thank you, Mr. President.

34:13.652 --> 34:17.054
General Florez!
General Florez, you need to reconsider.

34:21.196 --> 34:23.527
You know that the Hague Convention
guarantees that custody

34:23.630 --> 34:25.793
must be decided by the parents'
home country, right?

34:25.900 --> 34:27.163
- Right? Yes.
- Yes!

34:27.268 --> 34:28.463
I know. I know she's your wife.

34:28.571 --> 34:29.800
I know she's the mother of your children.

34:29.906 --> 34:33.637
And I know she seems weak now,
but she is smart.

34:33.744 --> 34:35.406
She is powerful.

34:35.513 --> 34:37.606
And smart, powerful women
like Carolina,

34:37.715 --> 34:39.706
they don't curl up and hide
when they've been wounded.

34:39.818 --> 34:41.114
They strike back.

34:41.219 --> 34:43.882
By writing memoirs
and appearing on talk shows,

34:43.989 --> 34:45.581
and at benefits and on red carpets,

34:45.692 --> 34:49.219
talking about women's rights
in the developing world.

34:49.329 --> 34:51.992
And how babies
were ripped from her arms

34:52.099 --> 34:54.033
by a ruthless dictator
who can't run a family,

34:54.135 --> 34:55.159
much less a country.

34:55.303 --> 34:57.430
And then one day, out of nowhere,

34:57.539 --> 35:00.634
she's not just the mother
of your children anymore.

35:00.743 --> 35:02.108
She's a hero.

35:02.211 --> 35:05.773
And people everywhere,
here, in your country,

35:05.883 --> 35:10.685
people love a hero, General.
People rise up and fight for a hero.

35:10.789 --> 35:12.689
And I will make it my personal mission

35:12.791 --> 35:15.022
that the rest of the world
is behind them when they do.

35:15.127 --> 35:17.527
So you need to tread
very carefully here,

35:17.630 --> 35:21.328
because what you do today
may determine your political survival.

35:21.434 --> 35:24.892
This woman can either be the mother
of your children

35:25.006 --> 35:28.442
or the face of your opposition.
Now which would you prefer?

36:22.374 --> 36:23.898
Okay, just one question.

36:24.009 --> 36:25.568
What happened to no lines
will be crossed here,

36:25.678 --> 36:27.612
no one will be harmed
in the making of this date?

36:28.114 --> 36:29.240
Oh. So this is a date.

36:31.485 --> 36:33.282
Okay. One question.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.619
Was Amanda Tanner
sleeping with the President?

36:42.398 --> 36:44.992
Don't you wish.
Now that would be a story.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.171
Hello.

36:54.279 --> 36:55.679
Dennis and Katherine Mahoney,

36:55.781 --> 36:57.544
emigrated from County Cork, Ireland,

36:57.650 --> 36:59.811
to Washington D.C.
In the summer of 1860,

36:59.919 --> 37:01.182
just in time for the Civil War.

37:01.288 --> 37:04.018
Started with nothing,
built an empire selling news in the front,

37:04.124 --> 37:06.889
and in 1973 their great-granddaughter
Margaret Mahoney

37:06.994 --> 37:10.624
sold her family newsstand chain
for $25 million.

37:10.766 --> 37:13.599
But she kept one for herself,
one to sell to one of her employees.

37:13.702 --> 37:16.263
Kiyong Kim, who had also
been working at Mahoney News

37:16.372 --> 37:18.670
since emigrating to Washington
from Busan, South Korea.

37:18.775 --> 37:21.040
Also with nothing.

37:21.912 --> 37:23.880
Kiyong Kim learned English
at that newsstand.

37:23.981 --> 37:25.745
He became a U.S. Citizen
at that newsstand.

37:25.850 --> 37:28.751
And eventually, he became
the owner of that newsstand,

37:28.853 --> 37:31.254
because Mahoney News is everything
that makes this country great.

37:31.357 --> 37:35.384
It would be a crime against the nation
to knock it down for greed and profit.

37:35.494 --> 37:38.259
Your boy Kiyong's got a news crew
showing up at 2:30 tomorrow

37:38.365 --> 37:39.332
for the 5:00 news

37:39.433 --> 37:41.834
<i>and an 800-word human interest story
in the D, C, Weekly,</i>

37:41.970 --> 37:44.370
which comes out Thursday.

37:46.041 --> 37:49.408
Does Olivia Pope ever
actually apologize to anyone?

37:50.279 --> 37:51.269
She just did.

38:01.393 --> 38:03.452
- Cyrus.
- Don't get up. This won't take long.

38:03.562 --> 38:04.790
Let's see, Abby Whelan,

38:04.896 --> 38:06.421
does her ex-husband
know where she is?

38:06.532 --> 38:07.794
Because he's been looking for her.

38:07.900 --> 38:09.868
Stephen Finch, he's been a bad boy.

38:09.969 --> 38:13.667
<i>This fellow, Huck.
His file reads like Helter Skelter,</i>

38:13.774 --> 38:15.366
A real page-turner,
and that's just the parts

38:15.476 --> 38:18.241
- that haven't been redacted.
- Nice show, Cyrus. Very scary.

38:18.346 --> 38:19.540
This is two days' work.

38:19.647 --> 38:22.583
And I'm a little worried about
all the trees that I'm gonna have to kill

38:22.685 --> 38:25.119
to print out the rest of the dirt I will find.

38:25.221 --> 38:28.157
You want to go nuclear?
I have that option, too.

38:28.258 --> 38:30.283
You should see the size
of the mushroom cloud

38:30.394 --> 38:31.919
that's going to go up
when the President is hit

38:32.030 --> 38:33.622
with a paternity suit for Amanda's baby.

38:33.731 --> 38:35.392
<i>It's going to make our 20/20 interview</i>

38:35.500 --> 38:36.763
look like a hug.

38:36.869 --> 38:39.565
Just finishing up some paperwork.
I'm going to need some blood.

38:39.671 --> 38:41.799
I really thought
I trained you better.

38:41.908 --> 38:44.069
You haven't even filed
the paternity suit yet.

38:44.177 --> 38:45.337
I expected that days ago.

38:45.445 --> 38:48.108
You seem awful chipper
about all this, Cyrus.

38:48.215 --> 38:50.115
I am, I am. I'll tell you why.

38:50.217 --> 38:51.378
I'm a workaholic

38:51.486 --> 38:53.351
and my sweet husband
doesn't let me work on Sundays,

38:53.455 --> 38:54.581
unless there's a war.

38:54.689 --> 38:56.885
Which is why I hate Sundays
and I really hate to garden.

38:56.993 --> 38:58.620
So you can see why I'd be excited.

38:58.728 --> 39:00.025
Because there is, in fact, a war.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.325
There's a bloody, scary war
starting, right now.

39:02.433 --> 39:05.163
You and I are going to war?
That's what you want? Fine.

39:05.269 --> 39:10.333
Oh! No! I'm sorry.
I wasn't clear.

39:10.442 --> 39:12.877
This isn't my war.
You know who sent me here?

39:12.978 --> 39:14.775
The President of the United States
sent me here.

39:15.414 --> 39:18.816
To this office,
to deliver these piles of dirt.

39:18.919 --> 39:20.978
I'm not the General, I'm not the bad guy,

39:21.088 --> 39:24.354
I'm just an errand boy
who doesn't have to garden anymore.

39:24.459 --> 39:27.088
President Fitzgerald Thomas Grant,
the Third,

39:27.196 --> 39:29.130
has declared war on you, Olivia.

39:29.231 --> 39:31.131
And he does so with the full force
of the White House,

39:31.233 --> 39:33.225
and the legion of men and women

39:33.336 --> 39:35.236
who work
in the United States Government.

39:35.338 --> 39:36.829
May God have mercy on your soul.

39:43.648 --> 39:48.348
I know I've been asking a lot of you all.
Asking you to trust me.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.913
And I know that hasn't
always been easy, or fair.

39:52.359 --> 39:54.327
And sometimes I am wrong.

39:55.929 --> 39:59.127
But we are about to go forward
with Amanda Tanner's case.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.337
Going up against the White House
is the biggest thing we've ever done.

40:03.439 --> 40:08.036
It will be hard. It will be mean.
It will be personal.

40:08.411 --> 40:12.644
But you don't have to do this
because I say so, not this time.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.014
You have to decide for yourselves.

40:15.353 --> 40:16.342
<i>It is a great honor for us</i>

40:16.454 --> 40:18.218
<i>to host this meeting
in Washington, once again,</i>

40:18.323 --> 40:20.917
<i>We are grateful for the reminder
that this New World of ours,</i>

40:21.026 --> 40:25.259
<i>America, North and South,
is more than an accident of geography,</i>

40:26.399 --> 40:29.767
So, let's vote on it.

40:33.842 --> 40:36.504
We are not gonna
make a dime out of this,

40:36.611 --> 40:37.874
but I still vote yes.

40:39.015 --> 40:43.146
<i>We, the free people of the Americas,</i>

40:43.253 --> 40:46.120
<i>are bound not only
by a shared history, but by...</i>

40:48.560 --> 40:49.584
I'm in.

40:51.229 --> 40:55.462
<i>Freedom, dignity, progress,</i>

41:00.006 --> 41:00.973
Yes.

41:01.741 --> 41:06.702
<i>I am sorry to tell you
that our work is not finished,</i>

41:08.183 --> 41:12.382
<i>For as long as some
of our brothers and sisters still live</i>

41:12.488 --> 41:14.388
<i>under the tyranny of dictators,</i>

41:14.490 --> 41:17.483
<i>we must not resign ourselves
to the status quo,</i>

41:19.863 --> 41:20.852
Of course.

41:22.534 --> 41:25.560
<i>Democracy is your destiny,</i>

41:40.121 --> 41:41.315
Over a cliff.

41:42.524 --> 41:45.789
<i>I call on my fellow leaders
to stand together</i>

41:45.894 --> 41:50.423
<i>and to speak with one voice,
loud, clear and strong...</i>

41:58.243 --> 42:01.337
All right, then. We go to war.

42:04.617 --> 42:08.520
<i>So General Florez, President Chàvez,
and President Castro,</i>

42:08.622 --> 42:10.146
<i>all those who would seek to squash</i>

42:10.257 --> 42:12.988
<i>individual rights and freedoms,
may hear us,</i>

42:13.461 --> 42:17.124
