04:15.603 --> 04:17.093
Get... Get...

04:27.448 --> 04:28.415
Up!

04:42.196 --> 04:43.561
You missed!

04:43.631 --> 04:48.933
You missed this time,
you little menace!

04:49.003 --> 04:51.972
I beat you!

04:53.140 --> 04:54.801
Morning.

05:08.022 --> 05:10.991
Honey, you're getting
all upset over nothing.

05:11.058 --> 05:13.151
- I'm not getting...
- Here.

05:13.227 --> 05:16.094
A nice breakfast
will cheer you up.

05:18.732 --> 05:21.064
I am not
getting upset over...

05:22.703 --> 05:26.469
- What is that?
- It's bacon.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.372
I know it's bacon.

05:29.443 --> 05:32.412
What have you done to it?

05:32.480 --> 05:35.472
You said you didn't like
all the grease from fried bacon...

05:35.549 --> 05:37.847
so I boiled it.

05:45.192 --> 05:48.320
What is Lane doing up
at this hour on a Sunday?

05:48.395 --> 05:51.626
Doesn't he turn to dust
if the sun hits him before noon?

05:51.699 --> 05:54.293
It's tryouts
for the high school ski team.

05:54.368 --> 05:56.734
He's going up
to Mt. Brody with Beth.

05:56.804 --> 05:58.669
Sure he's going up with Beth.

05:58.739 --> 06:00.798
He can't do anything
without that girl.

06:00.875 --> 06:04.436
I tell you, Jenny,
that boy is obsessed.

06:04.512 --> 06:06.742
Now, honey...

06:06.814 --> 06:08.247
obsessed?

06:20.995 --> 06:24.362
Do we not throw things away
when they're empty?

06:45.019 --> 06:48.386
What in the name
of all that's holy...

06:48.455 --> 06:50.389
Badger likes the prizes
you can get...

06:50.457 --> 06:52.891
from cutting the coupons
from the boxes.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.894
He's mailing them today.

06:54.962 --> 06:57.396
Can't you wait until the...

07:07.775 --> 07:12.769
Lane, a closet door can be closed
as well as it can be opened.

07:12.846 --> 07:15.406
Sorry, Dad.

07:15.482 --> 07:18.918
Dear, your breakfast
is getting cold.

07:18.986 --> 07:23.013
It's all right, Mom. I can't
have breakfast today. I got tryouts.

07:23.090 --> 07:25.684
Nervous stomach. Don't wanna
throw up from the chairlift again.

07:25.759 --> 07:29.718
Had to buy that guy
a new hat last time. Bye, Dad.

07:32.933 --> 07:36.596
Memorandum. I would like to
take a meeting with you tonight...

07:36.670 --> 07:40.800
to discuss that vehicle
you purchased several months ago...

07:40.874 --> 07:44.674
yet has darkened our driveway,
immobile, ever since.

07:44.745 --> 07:46.679
Okay, Dad. Noted.

07:46.747 --> 07:48.681
Talk to you tonight.
I gotta pick up Beth.

08:17.945 --> 08:19.412
Ricky.

08:26.487 --> 08:28.921
Don't be so shy. Come on.

08:33.092 --> 08:36.859
Monique, this is Ricky.

08:37.931 --> 08:40.399
Ricky, this is Monique...

08:40.467 --> 08:43.765
the French foreign exchange student
who'll be staying with us.

09:07.394 --> 09:09.692
It's an awesome spectacle...

09:09.763 --> 09:13.324
<i>and a vicious display</i>
<i>of seething opponents...</i>

09:13.400 --> 09:18.099
once again paralleled
in an obstinate attempt to prove...

09:18.172 --> 09:23.769
superiority of the roads
unequal in our lifetime.

09:23.844 --> 09:29.282
<i>The crowds swell with anticipation</i>
<i>as the lights turn green!</i>

09:39.426 --> 09:42.361
You stupid bonehead!
I'm gonna activate your dental plan!

09:42.429 --> 09:46.433
Come here, you idiot!
Get out of this car!

09:46.567 --> 09:49.263
If he asks me out,
of course I'm gonna go out with him.

09:49.336 --> 09:52.066
I mean, he skis the K-12.

09:52.139 --> 09:54.937
Yeah. He's so boss.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.776
I'll tell him after tryouts. You
know how he gets when he gets upset.

10:00.847 --> 10:03.782
Yeah. From the chairlift.

10:03.850 --> 10:07.217
He had to buy the guy
a new hat last time.

10:07.955 --> 10:11.447
Lane's here. I gotta go.
I'll call you later. Bye.

10:45.058 --> 10:47.026
He's the only person
in Greendale...

10:47.094 --> 10:51.258
that's ever skied the K-12
from the glacier and lived.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.311
Man, what a hunk.

11:28.435 --> 11:31.268
Listen up.
Your running time has to be...

11:31.338 --> 11:34.136
under 58 seconds to even
be considered for the team.

11:34.207 --> 11:36.903
Your time will be gauged
along with a rating...

11:36.977 --> 11:41.471
of one to ten on your style,
which will be judged solely by me...

11:41.548 --> 11:44.142
and my vast expertise
of skiing technique.

11:44.217 --> 11:48.847
Why don't we have you sorry-looking
lot of hopefuls make your way up.

11:48.922 --> 11:52.414
You future members of the girls'
ski team can all keep me company...

11:52.492 --> 11:54.722
until it's time
for you to take the track.

11:54.795 --> 11:57.889
- Who'd like to hold my clipboard?
- Me! Me!

12:00.500 --> 12:02.434
You'll make a fine little helper.
What's your name?

12:02.502 --> 12:06.233
- Charles De Mar.
- Shut up, geek.

12:08.308 --> 12:10.833
- What's your name?
- Beth.

12:10.911 --> 12:12.776
That's my favorite name.

12:15.615 --> 12:19.051
- <i>Buenos días.</i> Roy Stalin.
- <i>Hola.</i> Lane Myer.

12:19.119 --> 12:21.952
I can see you and I
share one common desire...

12:23.190 --> 12:26.057
the desire to be a part
of the well-oiled machinery...

12:26.126 --> 12:29.061
that is the Greendale
High School ski-racing team.

12:29.129 --> 12:31.791
- The desire for victory.
- Well, I...

12:31.865 --> 12:34.026
Right on! Get up there,
and let's see what you got.

12:43.210 --> 12:46.543
- Ready up there?
- <i>Yeah. We're all set.</i>

12:46.613 --> 12:48.604
What is the next victim's name?

12:48.682 --> 12:51.082
"Myer. Lane Myer."

12:51.151 --> 12:53.881
Is that as in Oscar Mayer?

12:53.954 --> 12:55.751
That's a roger, dude.

12:55.822 --> 12:58.518
You were standing with Oscar.

12:58.592 --> 13:02.050
Is he your main wiener man?

13:02.129 --> 13:05.792
Don't listen to Stalin, kid.
He's a punk.

13:05.866 --> 13:07.800
Now, you show 'em, Rock.

13:07.868 --> 13:10.666
You show 'em how a skier
really skis.

13:10.737 --> 13:14.332
- We're sending him down.
- That's a roger. Counting down.

13:15.242 --> 13:17.301
<i>Drei,</i> fry. Go!

13:44.371 --> 13:48.637
Too bad. Real close. Next.

13:48.708 --> 13:52.041
<i>Listen. I think we should talk.</i>

13:52.112 --> 13:54.080
<i>We've been seeing an awful lot</i>
<i>of each other lately...</i>

13:54.147 --> 13:55.910
<i>and I really think</i>
<i>it's in my best interest...</i>

13:55.982 --> 13:58.576
<i>if I went out</i>
<i>with someone more popular...</i>

13:58.652 --> 14:01.348
<i>better looking,</i>
<i>drives a nicer car.</i>

14:05.325 --> 14:10.092
Six months! Six months,
and she dumps me for him.

14:10.163 --> 14:12.495
For Stalin. Just like that.

14:12.566 --> 14:14.500
Six damn months!

14:20.173 --> 14:25.008
Truly a sight to behold...
a man beaten.

14:25.078 --> 14:27.069
<i>The once-great champ...</i>

14:27.147 --> 14:30.878
now a study in mawkishness.

14:30.951 --> 14:33.852
<i>No longer</i>
<i>the victory-hungry stallion...</i>

14:33.920 --> 14:37.185
- All right.
<i>- We've raced so many times before...</i>

14:37.257 --> 14:39.248
but a pathetic...

14:39.326 --> 14:42.022
washed-up, aged ex-champion.

14:42.095 --> 14:43.528
Let's go!

14:50.003 --> 14:52.403
Someone's gonna see God.

14:55.141 --> 14:57.302
I'm gonna break
your goddamn neck!

14:57.377 --> 15:00.039
Get outta the car!

15:00.113 --> 15:02.206
Get outta the car!

15:06.653 --> 15:08.917
Hello. How was your day?

15:08.989 --> 15:12.789
- Beth broke up with me.
- That's nice.

15:12.859 --> 15:14.793
We're through. That's it.

15:29.175 --> 15:31.643
What the hell?
Wait a minute here.

15:32.779 --> 15:34.713
Wait. This is death here.

15:36.983 --> 15:39.349
I haven't even been
to New York City.

15:39.419 --> 15:41.910
Jesus. I haven't
even been anywhere.

15:52.465 --> 15:56.026
Suicide is never the answer,
little trooper.

15:56.102 --> 15:59.765
Greendale is a bodaciously
small town.

15:59.839 --> 16:02.171
It's a flyspeck on the map...

16:02.242 --> 16:04.369
a rest stop on the way
to a ski slope.

16:04.444 --> 16:06.912
I can't even get real drugs
here.

16:08.048 --> 16:12.246
Stalin's a hero, the only one
in this town who can ski the K-12.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.482
You're a great skier,
but he's incredible.

16:16.856 --> 16:19.825
What if I ski the K-12?
You think she'd take me back?

16:22.829 --> 16:25.263
I'm back to suicide again.

16:30.370 --> 16:33.673
<i>I think we're all going</i>
<i>to enjoy this little treat.</i>

16:33.807 --> 16:36.571
I got the recipe
from the <i>Ladies'HomeJournal.</i>

16:36.643 --> 16:40.010
The mail got wet in the rain,
so some of the pages ran together.

16:40.079 --> 16:44.038
But what I couldn't read
I improvised with my own ideas.

16:44.117 --> 16:47.780
You see, it's got raisins in it.

16:48.855 --> 16:50.789
You like raisins.

16:52.592 --> 16:56.858
There is still one more thing
I would like to discuss with Lane.

16:58.164 --> 17:00.189
The subject is...

17:02.702 --> 17:05.671
is the mystery car.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.540
Thank you, honey.

17:09.608 --> 17:12.839
Which even as we speak...

17:12.912 --> 17:15.574
darkens our domain
under a moldy tarp.

17:15.647 --> 17:18.208
You do know the car
of which I speak?

17:18.284 --> 17:20.752
- Yeah. I just never...
- Let me refresh your memory.

17:20.819 --> 17:23.084
Cast your mind back.

17:23.156 --> 17:25.589
It's a crisp September morning.

17:25.657 --> 17:29.856
You borrowed $200 from me
to purchase the car...

17:29.929 --> 17:33.126
mainly because
your girlfriend Beth said it was...

17:33.199 --> 17:35.565
I believe the term was "tasty."

17:35.635 --> 17:38.570
Since then, that "tasty" car...

17:38.638 --> 17:42.904
has slept in an auto cocoon
on my front lawn.

17:44.277 --> 17:46.711
I'll get around to it.

17:48.181 --> 17:51.878
Have you seen the exchange student
who's staying at the Smiths's house?

17:51.951 --> 17:54.044
Perhaps you should go over
and welcome her to our town.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.054
I think she would like that.

17:56.122 --> 17:58.386
Mrs. Smith probably got her
so that weirdo son...

17:58.458 --> 18:01.393
could see what
a real girl looks like.

18:01.461 --> 18:04.521
You know,
he never goes outdoors.

18:04.597 --> 18:07.259
Just sits in that house,
crochets all day long.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.267
The Chapmans had
their exchange student...

18:09.335 --> 18:11.269
stay with them for six months.

18:11.337 --> 18:13.737
He practically became a son
to Jules and Irene.

18:13.806 --> 18:15.706
You mean that kid
from El Salvador?

18:15.775 --> 18:18.369
Can I be excused?
I'm not feeling well.

18:19.445 --> 18:21.379
I'm just gonna be excused.

18:33.693 --> 18:36.321
I can't figure it out, Badger.

18:36.396 --> 18:40.992
You seem smart. Why waste your time
with all this kid-stuff garbage?

18:44.370 --> 18:46.304
You're almost eight.

19:05.558 --> 19:07.992
It was love at first sight.

19:12.832 --> 19:14.766
<i>Red dog! Red dog!</i>

19:14.834 --> 19:17.894
92, 74, 16, 43!

19:17.971 --> 19:19.905
Bring it home, mama!

19:28.181 --> 19:30.115
Got it! Got it!

19:56.676 --> 19:58.610
So, how do you
like Greendale?

19:59.679 --> 20:01.112
Fine.

20:03.716 --> 20:06.913
And the school system,
you find it adequate?

20:06.986 --> 20:10.387
School hasn't started yet.

20:10.456 --> 20:13.118
<i>She itched her nose.</i>
<i>I wonder if that was...</i>

20:13.192 --> 20:16.161
<i>some kind of message to me</i>
<i>that there's something on my nose.</i>

20:16.229 --> 20:19.960
<i>That's funny.</i>
<i>He wiped his nose after I did.</i>

20:20.033 --> 20:23.196
<i>Maybe I got dirt on my nose</i>
<i>when I itched it.</i>

20:23.269 --> 20:25.897
<i>God, he's too embarrassed</i>
<i>to tell me.</i>

20:25.972 --> 20:28.566
<i>I must look sickening.</i>

20:28.641 --> 20:30.575
<i>There she goes again.</i>
<i>What could it be?</i>

20:30.643 --> 20:32.634
<i>Dirt? Relish?</i>

20:32.712 --> 20:34.646
<i>Relish on my nose? How gross.</i>

20:34.714 --> 20:36.648
- <i>She might think it's...</i>
- Usually Nazis.

20:36.716 --> 20:39.344
<i>Not that. Please don't</i>
<i>let it be a booger.</i>

20:39.419 --> 20:42.081
<i>Not now. Please, God.</i>

21:05.445 --> 21:08.039
I don't get it. How could...

21:08.114 --> 21:11.174
How could she
throw away six months?

21:11.250 --> 21:14.378
I mean, six months?

21:14.454 --> 21:17.014
Just like that?

21:17.090 --> 21:19.650
No explanation, no reason.

21:19.726 --> 21:22.593
Just throw it away.

21:22.662 --> 21:24.596
Doesn't...

21:24.664 --> 21:26.598
How can you just
throw away six months?

21:26.666 --> 21:29.601
I mean, when you're
in love with someone...

21:30.803 --> 21:33.465
Six months is just...
I'm history.

21:33.539 --> 21:35.973
Just bam!
Like that, I'm gone.

21:37.176 --> 21:39.440
She's probably just testing me.

21:39.512 --> 21:41.446
A big test.

21:41.514 --> 21:45.280
That's probably... That's her.

21:45.351 --> 21:47.785
That's her.

21:52.358 --> 21:55.555
- Johnny.
- Four weeks.

21:55.628 --> 21:58.461
Twenty papers.
That's two dollars.

21:58.531 --> 22:02.160
- Plus tip.
- I don't have a dime. Sorry.

22:03.069 --> 22:05.594
Didn't ask for a dime.

22:05.671 --> 22:08.003
Two dollars.

22:08.074 --> 22:11.475
Well, it's funny, see.
My mom had to leave early...

22:11.544 --> 22:13.808
to take my brother to school
and my dad to work 'cause...

22:13.880 --> 22:17.646
Two dollars. Cash.

22:17.717 --> 22:20.880
The problem here is...
my little brother, this morning...

22:20.953 --> 22:23.513
got his arm caught
in the microwave and...

22:23.589 --> 22:26.319
and my grandmother dropped acid
and freaked out...

22:26.392 --> 22:29.122
and hijacked a school bus
full of penguins.

22:29.195 --> 22:31.129
So it's kind of a family crisis.

22:31.197 --> 22:33.131
So come back later? Great.

22:41.274 --> 22:44.732
<i>Breakin'up is hard to do</i>

22:44.811 --> 22:47.439
<i>Don't take your love...</i>

22:47.513 --> 22:51.813
<i>- To me, and she's gone</i>
<i>- And she's gone</i>

22:51.884 --> 22:55.012
<i>Fifty ways to leave your lover</i>

22:55.087 --> 22:57.248
<i>Hurts so bad</i>

22:57.323 --> 23:02.693
<i>They say that breakin'up</i>
<i>is hard to do...</i>

23:05.498 --> 23:10.834
<i>The three cardinal</i>
<i>trapezoidal formations...</i>

23:10.903 --> 23:14.031
hereto made orientable
in our diagram...

23:14.106 --> 23:16.040
by connecting
the various points...

23:16.108 --> 23:20.340
HIGK, PEGQ and LMNO...

23:20.413 --> 23:24.611
creating our geometric
configurations...

23:24.684 --> 23:29.121
which have no properties,
but with location...

23:30.523 --> 23:36.120
are equal to
the described triangle CAB...

23:36.195 --> 23:37.628
quintuplicated.

23:38.698 --> 23:40.131
Therefore...

23:42.101 --> 23:44.194
it is also
the five triangles...

23:44.270 --> 23:47.000
composing
the aforementioned NIGH.

23:47.073 --> 23:52.143
Each are equal to the triangle
CAB in this geometric concept.

23:52.277 --> 23:55.678
Therefore, in a like manner...

23:55.747 --> 23:58.045
the geometric metaphors...

23:58.116 --> 24:01.176
can derive
a repeated vectoral sum.

24:02.253 --> 24:04.653
This was your assignment...

24:05.423 --> 24:08.324
and I would like
to see the results.

24:08.393 --> 24:11.453
Please, take them out.

24:34.886 --> 24:37.116
Oops.

24:37.188 --> 24:38.621
Sophia.

24:39.991 --> 24:43.620
- And Buster.
- Please!

24:43.695 --> 24:47.290
- Me! Me!
- And... Beth.

24:49.367 --> 24:51.665
- And...
- Please! Please!

24:51.736 --> 24:56.298
- Please, please!
- Mr. Myer.

24:56.374 --> 24:58.308
Please join us
at the blackboard...

24:58.376 --> 25:02.779
and show us your solution
to this paltry geometric dilemma.

25:25.803 --> 25:27.236
Sorry.

25:59.537 --> 26:01.732
For God's sakes,
would you relax?

26:01.806 --> 26:04.934
- It's just our virginity.
- Yeah, I agree totally.

26:05.009 --> 26:07.170
I feel like we should tell someone
or do something.

26:07.245 --> 26:09.736
I can get my dad's Polaroid
or something.

26:11.249 --> 26:13.274
- What was that?
- What was what?

26:13.351 --> 26:15.285
I heard something.

26:15.353 --> 26:17.913
We're in the most secluded place
in the Northern Hemisphere.

26:17.989 --> 26:20.423
I assure you
we are totally alone.

26:23.327 --> 26:24.760
Come on.

26:28.366 --> 26:30.231
What's wrong?

26:30.301 --> 26:32.895
That thing I put on me...
it broke.

26:34.272 --> 26:36.604
Broke? It broke?

26:36.674 --> 26:39.472
- Take it easy. I'll buy a new one.
- I don't want a new one!

26:39.544 --> 26:42.741
- Do you know what that means?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

26:52.957 --> 26:56.757
Now, now.
I'll see you all tomorrow.

26:56.828 --> 27:01.891
Just remember to memorize pages
39 to 110 for tomorrow's lesson.

27:01.966 --> 27:04.093
- All right!
- Cool!

27:10.641 --> 27:12.575
I just can't wait
till tomorrow.

27:13.811 --> 27:15.745
Wait for me at my locker.

27:17.682 --> 27:19.115
Listen...

27:19.183 --> 27:21.583
I've been thinking about what
you told me last night...

27:21.652 --> 27:23.745
and I've decided
I'm gonna help you.

27:23.821 --> 27:25.254
How?

27:26.958 --> 27:30.951
I've been going to this high school
for 71/2 years.

27:32.029 --> 27:33.792
I'm no dummy.

27:33.865 --> 27:36.095
I know high school girls.

27:37.168 --> 27:39.762
Two things. One...

27:39.837 --> 27:42.271
how about your sax?

27:42.340 --> 27:45.468
The thing about Roy is
he plays the guitar.

27:45.543 --> 27:48.103
- He does?
- Yeah. Girls love that.

27:48.179 --> 27:52.172
- Why don't you take up sax again?
- Number two?

27:53.784 --> 27:56.309
The K-12, dude.

27:56.387 --> 27:58.617
You make a gnarly run
like that...

27:58.689 --> 28:02.056
and girls will get sterile
just looking at you.

28:04.962 --> 28:08.056
Would you stay behind?
I'd like a word with you.

28:10.134 --> 28:11.897
We'll do this.

28:11.969 --> 28:13.664
Talk to you later.

28:16.541 --> 28:17.974
Yes, sir?

28:20.044 --> 28:22.478
This is a bit awkward.

28:22.547 --> 28:23.980
Yes, sir.

28:25.483 --> 28:26.916
Well...

28:28.219 --> 28:30.414
I've heard a few things, and...

28:32.490 --> 28:35.482
Well, I was wondering...

28:35.560 --> 28:37.585
if you would mind
if I took out Beth.

29:32.183 --> 29:34.151
<i>And I love you so much</i>

29:37.555 --> 29:41.992
<i>'Cause I met you</i>
<i>in first grade</i>

29:42.059 --> 29:43.890
<i>Yes, I love you</i>

29:55.973 --> 29:57.998
What'd you go
and do that for?

30:00.911 --> 30:02.845
Really. Why?

30:02.913 --> 30:04.175
That's sick.

30:04.248 --> 30:08.617
"Sick"? I love you.
How could you dump me for him?

30:08.686 --> 30:12.122
Face it.
You're a no-show, a loss.

30:12.189 --> 30:15.522
You're immature. You can't do
a single thing by yourself.

30:15.593 --> 30:17.891
You're a spastic Nerf bag
all the time.

30:17.962 --> 30:20.658
And besides,
Roy can ski the K-12.

30:20.731 --> 30:24.167
How could I enjoy high school
with you as a boyfriend?

30:24.235 --> 30:27.295
Any girl in this school would be
overwhelmed to go out with me.

30:44.188 --> 30:47.157
Chris Cummins?
You haven't got a chance.

30:47.224 --> 30:50.716
- She'd go out with me in a second.
- Listen, you forget.

30:50.795 --> 30:53.286
Chris Cummins dates
the basketball team.

30:53.364 --> 30:56.561
Not certain members of the team.
The whole team.

30:56.634 --> 30:58.864
You so much as talk to her,
you're dead.

30:58.936 --> 31:00.904
So let's just say
you give it up.

31:00.971 --> 31:03.874
Yeah, Oscar Mayer.
I think that's a fine idea.

31:04.008 --> 31:05.498
I will not give it up!

31:05.576 --> 31:09.012
You'll be sorry.
Someday you'll want me back!

31:15.185 --> 31:16.618
Sorry.

31:20.257 --> 31:22.191
I'm gonna get some milk.

31:23.260 --> 31:25.194
Just one milk.

31:25.262 --> 31:26.854
I'll be okay.

31:30.034 --> 31:32.059
Watch this.

31:35.472 --> 31:37.963
- Can I borrow these a minute?
- What's the idea?

31:38.042 --> 31:39.475
Just for a minute.

31:39.543 --> 31:43.912
Here. Buy yourself another leotard.
Be back in a minute, okay?

31:56.760 --> 31:58.193
Excuse me.

32:01.565 --> 32:03.499
I was thinking...

32:03.567 --> 32:06.502
you skate, I skate...
we skate.

32:06.570 --> 32:09.437
- Maybe we could get together and...
- You're a jerk.

32:09.506 --> 32:11.440
Be a skating team.

32:19.850 --> 32:23.115
- I was saying before...
- See you later, guys.

32:43.373 --> 32:45.307
Let's go! Let's go!

33:07.464 --> 33:09.591
- What?
- What are you doing?

33:09.666 --> 33:12.601
- Nothing.
- Yes, you are.

33:15.272 --> 33:17.706
Buck up, little camper.

33:17.775 --> 33:22.303
- We'll beat that slope together.
- Yeah?

33:22.379 --> 33:24.472
Yeah.

33:25.849 --> 33:27.840
I'm right behind ya, buddy.

33:45.502 --> 33:48.869
Man, it's a real shame
when folks be throwin' away...

33:48.939 --> 33:51.305
a perfectly good white boy
like that.

33:55.279 --> 33:58.840
If I could get past this first lip,
the rest would be a breeze.

33:58.916 --> 34:00.474
I'm telling you...

34:04.388 --> 34:06.049
Hold on!
Wait one second.

34:06.123 --> 34:08.056
I think I'm on
to something here.

34:08.125 --> 34:11.958
This is pure snow.
It's everywhere.

34:12.029 --> 34:15.089
Have you any idea what the street
value of this mountain is?

34:15.165 --> 34:16.860
Wait a minute. Hold it.

34:27.177 --> 34:28.610
Outrageous.

34:30.280 --> 34:33.737
I think I froze
the left half of my brain.

34:33.817 --> 34:36.513
Look. I can't move
my right arm.

34:36.587 --> 34:39.681
- Will you get serious?
- Look, dude...

34:39.755 --> 34:41.690
it's Christmas Eve.

34:41.757 --> 34:45.125
I could be home right now
drinking this monster eggnog...

34:45.195 --> 34:47.129
my brother makes
with lighter fluid.

34:47.197 --> 34:50.030
You've been staring
over that edge for hours.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.364
People die down there.

34:52.436 --> 34:54.768
And dying
when you're not really sick...

34:54.838 --> 34:56.772
is really sick, you know?

34:56.840 --> 35:00.003
This is very important to me.
I mean, really.

35:00.077 --> 35:02.477
If I don't believe in myself,
I'm nothing.

35:02.546 --> 35:04.480
I'll be as bad as Ricky Smith.

35:04.548 --> 35:07.745
He sits around crocheting all day
and snorting nasal spray.

35:07.818 --> 35:10.252
- I gotta do it!
- He snorts nasal spray?

35:10.320 --> 35:12.254
Know where I can score some?

35:12.322 --> 35:15.223
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- All right. All right.

35:15.292 --> 35:17.055
I'll tell you what to do.

35:17.127 --> 35:21.791
Go that way really fast.

35:21.865 --> 35:25.596
If something gets
in your way, turn.

35:28.005 --> 35:30.735
What a coach.

35:30.807 --> 35:32.741
I'm gonna do it.

35:48.458 --> 35:51.120
All right! Now turn!

36:01.471 --> 36:04.440
<i>Hello, Beth? Hey, it's Christmas.</i>

36:04.508 --> 36:07.136
I was thinking
maybe me and you could...

36:09.079 --> 36:11.775
No, we didn't open
our presents yet.

36:11.848 --> 36:14.180
You did.

36:14.251 --> 36:16.185
The cutest thing ever.

36:17.421 --> 36:18.854
From Roy.

36:21.191 --> 36:24.456
A giant teddy bear
bigger than you.

36:24.528 --> 36:26.462
Sounds great.

36:27.831 --> 36:30.265
It really does sound good.

36:30.334 --> 36:33.269
Look, I gotta go.
The Christmas tree's on fire.

36:55.525 --> 36:57.959
Now open this one next.

36:59.363 --> 37:01.228
I remembered
how much you liked...

37:01.298 --> 37:03.732
the chocolate-nut brownie
in this one.

37:03.800 --> 37:07.896
And look, corn in seasoned sauce.
He likes corn.

37:12.175 --> 37:15.838
Now, come on. Don't be shy.
Give her your present.

37:18.248 --> 37:20.580
Come on.
Give her your present.

37:21.918 --> 37:23.852
Come on.

37:31.762 --> 37:34.356
That's a Christmas present.

37:35.632 --> 37:38.157
Do you have Christmas
in France?

37:40.103 --> 37:43.095
Christmas.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.107
Christmas.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.610
Yeah. It's from Ricky.

38:02.726 --> 38:05.320
You can take that
wherever you go...

38:05.395 --> 38:09.764
to always remember your trip
to the United States.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.108
How come you're so small?

38:28.185 --> 38:32.918
Now. Everyone's gonna be
wearing one of these this year.

38:34.157 --> 38:36.091
Honey, what have you done?

38:37.160 --> 38:38.593
There.

38:39.663 --> 38:41.756
It's real aardvark fur.

38:42.833 --> 38:44.767
Really?

38:44.835 --> 38:46.735
Well, honey, it's sure...

38:48.238 --> 38:50.172
warm.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.936
- Now for the best part.
- What?

38:53.009 --> 38:54.943
The hood.

39:00.183 --> 39:02.879
Everybody's gonna be
wearing one of these.

39:02.953 --> 39:04.887
Isn't it fun?

39:17.701 --> 39:20.636
- What is it?
- I'll show you soon. Almost there.

39:20.704 --> 39:22.729
- You'll see it in a second. Ready?
- Yeah.

39:22.806 --> 39:24.740
- Okay?
- Okay. All right.

39:26.910 --> 39:30.004
Al, you fixed the windows.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.072
It's a Christmas miracle.

39:33.150 --> 39:38.213
Wait a minute, Mr. Bear. This
is crazy. I bet we get her back.

39:52.068 --> 39:54.093
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

40:22.766 --> 40:26.133
Your book on how to
pick up trashy women came today.

40:26.203 --> 40:27.636
Tell me something.

40:27.704 --> 40:31.640
What's a little boy like you
doing with big-boy smut like this?

40:39.082 --> 40:41.312
Hi. I was just wondering...

40:41.384 --> 40:43.818
I know that we don't
even know each other...

40:43.887 --> 40:46.822
but I know that you were going out
with that girl Beth.

40:46.890 --> 40:50.826
I can see that you're not
going out with her anymore...

40:50.961 --> 40:53.020
and I was wondering if perhaps
I could just be with her...

40:53.096 --> 40:55.326
go to the movies,
have a soda.

40:59.236 --> 41:03.263
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Yeah.

41:03.340 --> 41:06.275
Come in here and sit down,
please, young man.

41:11.314 --> 41:14.750
- Look, I'm sorry about the garage.
- Let me give you the bottom line.

41:14.818 --> 41:17.184
It would be entirely beneficial...

41:17.254 --> 41:20.121
if you were to reenter
the sociological mainstream...

41:20.190 --> 41:23.956
by reengaging in the ritual act of
dating members of the opposite sex.

41:24.027 --> 41:26.359
I don't wanna date other girls.
I wanna date Beth.

41:26.429 --> 41:29.796
I'm sorry to inform you that you are
going to start dating other girls.

41:29.866 --> 41:31.458
- Starting tonight.
- Oh?

41:31.534 --> 41:34.435
Tonight at 6:00,
you're picking up Joanne Greenwald.

41:34.504 --> 41:37.200
- Your law partner's daughter?
- That's right.

41:37.274 --> 41:39.799
The one with the big antenna
on her face?

41:39.876 --> 41:42.071
Come on.

41:43.213 --> 41:45.147
Mellow off.

41:45.215 --> 41:47.342
It's a brand-new year.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.977
There's a New Year's Eve dance
at your school.

41:50.053 --> 41:53.784
- You kids love this disco thing.
- Disco? Come on, Dad.

41:53.857 --> 41:57.884
You are really...
bringing me over, man.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.660
- 6:00.
- Right off.

42:06.736 --> 42:08.670
- On.
- On. Right...

42:08.738 --> 42:12.105
All right, Joanne Greenwald,
you horrible thing...

42:12.175 --> 42:15.611
here's your one chance
to go out with a real stud.

42:15.679 --> 42:18.614
One night with me, and she'll
probably go blind with ecstasy.

42:18.682 --> 42:20.115
Poor creature.

42:20.183 --> 42:23.778
I hope she doesn't
grab on to my leg and start...

42:23.853 --> 42:25.787
crying when the date's over.

42:25.855 --> 42:27.789
God, what do you do?

42:44.074 --> 42:46.008
All right, Joanne Greenwald.

42:52.315 --> 42:54.249
Hi, Joanne.

42:54.317 --> 42:58.754
Pal, let's get something straight.
I don't wanna go out with you...

42:58.822 --> 43:01.757
and I'm just doing this
as a favor to my dad, right?

43:01.825 --> 43:04.157
- I know you're happy to be...
- Right.

43:04.227 --> 43:07.685
So let's make it a whole lot
easier on ourselves, shall we?

43:07.764 --> 43:11.131
First, we'd have gone out to dinner.
That's ten bucks apiece.

43:11.201 --> 43:13.431
Unless you're a cheapskate...

43:13.503 --> 43:15.767
but I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

43:15.839 --> 43:18.364
- Thanks.
- I would've ordered double desserts.

43:18.441 --> 43:22.275
That's $22 altogether.
Tax and tip... 25.

43:22.345 --> 43:26.111
Making it a grand total
of $26.37.

43:26.182 --> 43:30.243
Half of which
is approximately $ 13.67.

43:30.320 --> 43:35.417
Why don't you give me that 13.67,
and we'll call it a night?

43:35.492 --> 43:37.653
- Do you take checks?
- Sure.

43:43.299 --> 43:47.133
<i>You never know if you're</i>
<i>the victim or the fool</i>

43:48.872 --> 43:52.535
<i>Only know I can't stop</i>
<i>thinkin'about you</i>

43:54.677 --> 43:58.477
<i>Love was good until</i>
<i>you took it on the run</i>

44:00.116 --> 44:04.917
<i>But I fell too hard</i>
<i>I guess I ain't the one</i>

44:06.523 --> 44:09.083
<i>Starin'the night away</i>

44:09.159 --> 44:12.060
<i>Don't know where you are</i>

44:12.128 --> 44:14.756
<i>Callin'out your name</i>

44:14.831 --> 44:17.026
<i>This crazy feelin'</i>

44:17.100 --> 44:19.568
<i>Of a one-way love</i>

44:25.675 --> 44:28.007
You want a sandwich?

44:29.512 --> 44:30.945
Sure?

44:35.385 --> 44:39.048
<i>Face to face</i>
<i>I had no secrets to hide</i>

44:41.724 --> 44:44.818
Well, you sure got my vote
for cutest couple.

44:44.894 --> 44:48.386
Better shave her a little closer
before you kiss her good night.

44:53.169 --> 44:55.069
"You better..."

44:59.275 --> 45:01.140
"You better shave..."

45:09.750 --> 45:12.719
<i>I've been searchin'every day</i>

45:12.786 --> 45:15.619
<i>Tryin'to find another way</i>

45:15.689 --> 45:17.987
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

45:18.058 --> 45:20.583
<i>Than to live without you</i>

45:44.785 --> 45:46.946
<i>I'd rather be a fool</i>

45:47.021 --> 45:49.546
<i>I'd be lost</i>
<i>with someone new</i>

45:50.624 --> 45:52.615
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

45:52.693 --> 45:54.957
<i>Than to live without you</i>

45:56.397 --> 45:59.093
<i>I've been searchin'every day</i>

45:59.166 --> 46:02.192
<i>Tryin'to find another way</i>

46:02.269 --> 46:04.396
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

46:04.471 --> 46:06.598
<i>Than to live without you</i>

46:08.442 --> 46:10.774
<i>I'd rather be a fool</i>

46:10.844 --> 46:13.745
<i>I'd be lost</i>
<i>with someone new</i>

46:13.814 --> 46:15.873
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

46:15.950 --> 46:18.248
<i>Than to live without you</i>

46:19.887 --> 46:22.412
<i>I've been searchin'every day</i>

46:22.489 --> 46:25.458
<i>Tryin'to find another way</i>

46:25.526 --> 46:27.551
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

46:27.628 --> 46:30.461
<i>Than to live without you</i>

46:31.799 --> 46:34.097
<i>I'd rather be a fool</i>

46:34.168 --> 46:37.069
<i>I'd be lost</i>
<i>with someone new</i>

46:37.137 --> 46:39.264
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

46:39.340 --> 46:41.308
<i>Than to live without you</i>

46:42.476 --> 46:45.468
<i>I'd be tempted</i>

46:45.546 --> 46:48.606
<i>I'd be tempted</i>

46:48.682 --> 46:50.877
<i>I'd be better off dead</i>

46:50.951 --> 46:54.853
<i>Than to live without you</i>

47:14.408 --> 47:20.438
<i>You're the best thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to me</i>

47:20.581 --> 47:22.845
<i>I knew right away</i>

47:22.916 --> 47:24.975
<i>I knew right away</i>

47:38.766 --> 47:40.199
It's okay.

47:40.267 --> 47:44.203
I was planning on having my nose
flattened by a professional anyway.

47:48.575 --> 47:52.568
You're that French kid staying with
the dorkheads... Smiths next door.

47:52.646 --> 47:54.739
We're neighbors.

47:56.850 --> 47:58.283
Me Lane.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.353
Monique Junet.

48:01.422 --> 48:03.583
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>you're here tonight</i>

48:05.959 --> 48:10.020
<i>Who told me dreams</i>
<i>don't work out great</i>

48:10.097 --> 48:12.031
You do speak English,
don't you?

48:13.901 --> 48:16.461
That's okay.
I don't speak French.

48:24.745 --> 48:27.077
I had no idea
where you'd gotten off to.

48:27.147 --> 48:29.081
You shouldn't make me worry.

48:33.220 --> 48:36.815
I see you've made Monique's...
acquaintance.

48:36.890 --> 48:40.690
A number of times, yes. She's
a delightful girl with a firm grip.

48:40.761 --> 48:44.891
Mother will pick us up
at the entrance of the school.

48:44.965 --> 48:47.195
She'll be very disappointed
if we aren't right...

48:47.267 --> 48:49.792
at the entrance
of the school.

48:49.870 --> 48:53.966
Tell you what. Why don't you wait
in the front of the school?

48:54.041 --> 48:56.566
And when Mom gets here,
you have her honk the old horn.

48:56.643 --> 49:00.101
Monique and I would like
to continue our conversation.

49:00.180 --> 49:02.580
You should not upset Mother...

49:02.649 --> 49:04.082
ever.

49:09.790 --> 49:12.224
I guess people do a lot
of handshaking in France.

49:15.629 --> 49:20.589
I wanted to let you know there's
an opening on the water ballet team.

49:20.667 --> 49:23.795
I can make a call if you want.
Come on.

49:25.339 --> 49:27.899
All right.
Studs and babes with Roy!

49:29.743 --> 49:31.677
Why aren't you with Ricky?

49:34.481 --> 49:36.745
Well, nice meeting you.

49:36.817 --> 49:38.250
Good night.

49:41.054 --> 49:43.318
Why weren't you there
as I told you?

49:43.390 --> 49:45.824
- I told her, Mom.
- I know.

49:45.893 --> 49:47.827
Don't you understand English?

49:47.895 --> 49:49.294
Bye.

50:06.513 --> 50:08.845
Two dollars.

50:13.687 --> 50:15.621
Two dollars.

50:19.693 --> 50:21.627
- Two dollars.
- Two dollars.

50:43.550 --> 50:45.882
Keys!

50:59.499 --> 51:02.263
Hi. How was your date?

51:02.336 --> 51:04.361
They're out there.
They're after me.

51:35.202 --> 51:37.136
Happy New Year.

52:03.964 --> 52:06.762
- Honey, where's Lane?
- He just came in.

52:06.833 --> 52:09.427
He went skiing this morning
with Charles De Mar.

52:09.503 --> 52:11.504
I think he's in the shower.

52:12.405 --> 52:15.465
<i>In me, you see</i>

52:15.541 --> 52:20.308
<i>A man alone</i>

52:22.849 --> 52:25.249
What's taking him so long?

52:25.318 --> 52:29.118
It's his first day at work.
I don't want him to be late.

52:29.188 --> 52:31.554
<i>A man who listens</i>

52:31.624 --> 52:36.618
<i>To the trembling of the trees</i>

52:36.696 --> 52:40.792
<i>With sentimental ease</i>

52:43.303 --> 52:46.568
<i>In me, you see</i>

52:46.639 --> 52:51.338
<i>A man alone</i>

52:51.411 --> 52:54.141
<i>Behind the wall</i>

52:54.213 --> 52:58.809
<i>He's learned to call his own</i>

52:58.885 --> 53:02.377
<i>A man who still goes</i>

53:02.455 --> 53:04.855
<i>Walkin'in the rain</i>

53:06.826 --> 53:12.025
<i>- Expecting love again</i>
- You better...

53:32.518 --> 53:35.954
- So you're Al Myer's kid.
- Yes, I am.

53:36.022 --> 53:40.083
- You look pretty stupid to me.
- Thank you.

53:40.159 --> 53:45.187
Let's see if you have any brains.
First you take the meat.

53:45.264 --> 53:47.789
- You understand?
- Yeah.

53:47.867 --> 53:50.665
Then you pat it
in the pig mold.

53:50.737 --> 53:54.503
- Push it in the pig mold.
- This is a push.

53:54.574 --> 53:56.508
This is a pat.

53:56.576 --> 54:00.205
Then take the pig mold
and put it on the tray.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.839
Now put on this hat.

54:02.915 --> 54:04.849
See that sign up there?

54:04.917 --> 54:07.886
You wear it with pride.
Put it on!

54:13.559 --> 54:16.585
You gotta have pride and class
in this business. Understand?

54:16.662 --> 54:18.095
Now...

54:21.768 --> 54:23.395
What's that?

54:23.469 --> 54:25.630
Those are the keys
to this establishment.

54:25.705 --> 54:29.300
I want you in here at 6:00 a.m.
Saturday morning.

54:29.375 --> 54:33.209
This place has to be mopped up
before the breakfast crew get here.

54:33.279 --> 54:35.406
- Roger.
- All right.

54:36.849 --> 54:38.942
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna go wash my hands.

54:39.018 --> 54:42.419
- I gotta mold and pat.
- Wash your hands on your own time.

54:42.488 --> 54:44.422
- Now, get to work.
- Yes, sir.

54:47.026 --> 54:48.118
- Fat pig.
- What?

54:48.194 --> 54:49.786
Pat. Pat pig.

55:10.950 --> 55:12.884
Everybody wants some.

55:18.424 --> 55:20.619
I'll show you
what everybody wants.

55:25.064 --> 55:27.760
They call me mad!
Mad! Mad!

55:27.834 --> 55:29.768
Me, a fool?

56:19.685 --> 56:21.744
It's alive!

56:29.462 --> 56:30.895
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

56:33.266 --> 56:35.200
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

56:40.506 --> 56:44.374
<i>You can't get romantic</i>
<i>on a subway line</i>

56:47.079 --> 56:48.512
<i>Conductor don't like it</i>

56:48.581 --> 56:51.106
<i>Says you're wastin'your time</i>

56:53.152 --> 56:56.315
<i>But everybody wants some</i>

56:56.389 --> 56:58.687
<i>I want some too</i>

56:59.892 --> 57:02.622
<i>Everybody wants some</i>

57:02.695 --> 57:04.629
<i>Baby, how 'bout you</i>

57:04.697 --> 57:07.598
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

57:07.667 --> 57:11.068
<i>I seen a lot of people</i>
<i>lookin'for a moonbeam</i>

57:13.806 --> 57:18.470
<i>Yeah, ya spent a lot</i>
<i>Ya got lost in thejet stream</i>

57:19.812 --> 57:24.408
<i>Everybody wants some</i>
<i>I want some too</i>

57:30.856 --> 57:32.790
Oops.

57:49.942 --> 57:51.876
Lookin' really good today, buddy.

57:51.944 --> 57:53.878
Lookin' real good.

57:56.148 --> 57:58.013
Goon.

58:05.725 --> 58:07.158
All right.

58:09.595 --> 58:10.755
This is it.

58:26.145 --> 58:29.444
<i>- Look, Barney, a falling star.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

58:31.384 --> 58:33.318
<i>- Let's make a wish.</i>
<i>- A wish?</i>

58:33.386 --> 58:35.786
<i>If you wish on a falling star,</i>
<i>your wish will come true.</i>

58:35.855 --> 58:38.722
<i>No kiddin'?</i>

58:40.226 --> 58:44.390
<i>- What did you wish for, Betty?</i>
<i>- Can't tell ya.</i>

58:44.463 --> 58:46.397
<i>It would spoil the wish.</i>

58:46.465 --> 58:49.400
<i>- Don't tell me your wish either.</i>
<i>- I won't.</i>

58:50.870 --> 58:55.136
<i>Hey there. I know this is awkward,</i>
<i>me being a cartoon and all.</i>

58:55.207 --> 58:59.109
<i>I was just wondering how you'd feel</i>
<i>if I took out Beth.</i>

59:26.138 --> 59:27.571
Matches.

59:29.408 --> 59:32.741
Where have you been?
We've all been waiting for you.

59:32.811 --> 59:35.746
You come and sit
right down here.

59:39.285 --> 59:42.083
- Have you met Monique?
- Hi.

59:42.154 --> 59:47.888
Now, in honor of our special guest,
I've created "Dinner Mon Dieu."

59:47.960 --> 59:50.861
First we have...

59:50.930 --> 59:54.127
"Fraunch" fries.

59:54.200 --> 59:56.361
And...

59:56.435 --> 59:58.369
"Fraunch" dressing.

01:00:00.339 --> 01:00:03.934
And "Fraunch" bread.

01:00:04.009 --> 01:00:06.443
And to drink... ta-da!

01:00:06.512 --> 01:00:08.446
"Peru."

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:15.943
You really do go to the outer limits
to make an impression.

01:00:19.592 --> 01:00:22.720
Monique, enjoying your stay
in our town?

01:00:25.231 --> 01:00:29.634
I say, are enjoying your stay
in our town?

01:00:29.702 --> 01:00:32.466
- She doesn't speak English, Dad.
- Of course she does.

01:00:33.739 --> 01:00:36.435
- Are you enjoying your stay...
- It's no good, Al.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.669
- She don't speak a word.
- Wait a minute.

01:00:38.744 --> 01:00:42.077
I thought foreign exchange students
had to speak some English.

01:00:42.147 --> 01:00:45.241
Well, as we're discovering
around our household...

01:00:45.317 --> 01:00:49.185
you don't need words
to speak the international language.

01:00:49.255 --> 01:00:51.416
Right, Ricky?

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.519
The international language.

01:00:58.564 --> 01:01:03.467
You know... love.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:06.163
The language of love.

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:09.139
I think Monique and our little Ricky
have a regular...

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:12.006
cross-continental romance
brewing here.

01:01:13.145 --> 01:01:16.512
- Him? And her?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:01:16.582 --> 01:01:18.516
That makes sense.

01:01:24.256 --> 01:01:27.123
What does that mean?

01:01:27.192 --> 01:01:29.558
I think she wants
to use the bathroom.

01:01:31.096 --> 01:01:36.864
It's down the hall,
second door on the left.

01:01:41.106 --> 01:01:45.008
Jennifer,
this is fabulous liqueur.

01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:50.646
Reminds me of the moonshine
Ricky's dead pappy used to make.

01:01:50.716 --> 01:01:54.208
- God bless him.
- Mrs. Smith! No! Wait!

01:01:57.389 --> 01:02:01.917
I'm real sorry your mom blew up,
Ricky. Doctor said she'll be okay.

01:02:01.994 --> 01:02:05.623
I guess she just won't be able
to eat any spicy foods for a while.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.535
Not now.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.773
- What do they want?
- They want a race.

01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:28.217
- Lane Myer, the kid from Greendale.
- Here's a good example.

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:30.949
- I don't know.
- Brothers. One speaks no English.

01:02:31.023 --> 01:02:34.424
The other learned English from
watching the <i>Wide World of Sports.</i>

01:02:34.493 --> 01:02:36.518
You tell me which is better...
speaking no English at all...

01:02:36.595 --> 01:02:39.530
or speaking Howard Cosell.

01:02:39.598 --> 01:02:44.661
<i>The chances seem slim that</i>
<i>this once-great has the nerve...</i>

01:02:44.737 --> 01:02:46.932
the desire to win,
that he once had.

01:02:47.005 --> 01:02:50.304
You must obey the proper
speed limits. A car is not a toy.

01:02:58.016 --> 01:03:01.247
- We'll take these guys!
- It's a close race.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.619
<i>Myer takes the lead.</i>
<i>This could go in Myer's favor.</i>

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:07.488
You're exceeding the speed limit.
Lane Myer, slow down.

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:15.596
<i>Myer takes the lead.</i>
<i>This could go in Myer's favor.</i>

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:17.897
<i>It looks very, very close.</i>

01:03:47.332 --> 01:03:50.699
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Ricky's dead.

01:03:50.769 --> 01:03:54.296
Ricky, are you dead?
I think he's dead. Monique.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.307
Monique, I'm sorry.

01:04:11.356 --> 01:04:13.483
I'm telling my mom.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:29.673
See you later.

01:04:30.943 --> 01:04:33.605
Ever since I got my license, those
kamikaze pilots have been after me.

01:04:33.679 --> 01:04:35.840
If I only had my Camaro running.
If I had my Camaro running...

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:38.314
I would blow those boys
off the street... vroom.

01:04:38.383 --> 01:04:41.318
That thing goes so fast.
It's got an engine...

01:05:06.178 --> 01:05:08.112
Looks good, huh?

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.377
I guess after my mom's cooking,
you'll probably tolerate anything.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:14.010
Have a Ding Dong. They're good.

01:05:15.087 --> 01:05:17.282
There they are.

01:05:27.432 --> 01:05:29.957
Don't get me wrong.
My mom means well, she really does.

01:05:30.035 --> 01:05:33.368
Cooking's her new thing.
She cooks all the time now.

01:05:34.506 --> 01:05:37.907
- It's better than it used to be.
- Hey! <i>Buenos días.</i>

01:05:44.449 --> 01:05:47.316
I stopped by to tell you I'm gonna
be picking a new captain...

01:05:47.386 --> 01:05:49.286
for the ski team on Sunday.

01:05:49.354 --> 01:05:54.121
All you gotta do to be captain,
Myer, is beat me.

01:05:54.192 --> 01:05:58.390
The tryouts won't be the same
if you're not there, champ.

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:04.700
So what are you and Myer
talking about?

01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:06.761
Is he telling you
what a great lover he is?

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:10.171
She only speaks French, Roy.
She doesn't speak "imbecile."

01:06:12.911 --> 01:06:17.780
There's one language I speak
that all women understand.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:21.012
Just ask your last girlfriend.

01:06:21.086 --> 01:06:23.714
Would you like
to learn some new words?

01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:25.723
Shit! Stupid!

01:06:28.126 --> 01:06:30.788
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:34.389
Myer's new frog girlfriend here
is just as much of a clod as he is.

01:06:34.466 --> 01:06:38.368
Hold on. You think you're such a big
tough guy because you're captain.

01:06:38.437 --> 01:06:41.339
The truth is, I could
out-ski you any day of the week.

01:06:41.473 --> 01:06:43.373
- Really?
- You want a race, I'll take you on.

01:06:43.441 --> 01:06:46.410
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- From the K-12, champ.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.412
- Chicken?
- What did you say?

01:06:50.482 --> 01:06:55.283
- Anytime. You name it.
- You're diggin' your own grave.

01:06:55.353 --> 01:06:57.116
No one has to know.
Just me and you.

01:06:57.188 --> 01:06:59.782
Sunday. High noon.

01:06:59.858 --> 01:07:02.190
You're on.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:10.561
<i>This just in. Lane Myer</i>
<i>will be racing Roy Stalin...</i>

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:13.934
<i>down K-12 this Sunday at noon.</i>

01:07:22.547 --> 01:07:25.744
I must be brain-damaged.
I'm gonna race. I'm gonna lose.

01:07:25.817 --> 01:07:27.751
And I'm gonna die.

01:07:30.288 --> 01:07:34.224
That? Is my car. The Camaro.

01:07:34.292 --> 01:07:38.092
Remember? I was telling you
about it before? It doesn't work.

01:07:38.163 --> 01:07:42.429
My little brother, he's building
a space shuttle out of appliances.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.765
That thing's going to work. I can't
get that out of the driveway.

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:55.274
I'll talk to you later.
I gotta go.

01:08:18.603 --> 01:08:21.231
Smitty? Yo, Smitty!

01:08:24.876 --> 01:08:27.970
How's it going?
Here's the ski you called about.

01:08:28.046 --> 01:08:30.344
My God. What happened to you?
You're all mangled.

01:08:30.415 --> 01:08:33.578
- You get hit by a truck?
- I was trying to ski the K-12.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:36.745
After the Olympics,
everything looked so damned easy.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:40.551
You gotta be a real moron
to try to ski that run, you know?

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:42.850
Yeah.

01:08:43.928 --> 01:08:46.897
- Charge it.
- Have a nice day.

01:08:50.969 --> 01:08:53.665
This is as bad
as it will ever get.

01:09:05.483 --> 01:09:09.283
I want my two dollars!
Two dollars!

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:12.755
I want my two dollars! Two dollars!

01:09:17.395 --> 01:09:19.453
I want my two dollars!

01:09:35.179 --> 01:09:37.443
No! I can't swim!

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:07.173
Something wrong, Monique?

01:10:10.348 --> 01:10:13.511
Nice talking to you.

01:10:14.552 --> 01:10:17.112
Hell, yes, something is wrong!

01:10:17.188 --> 01:10:21.386
This, how you say, "dorkhead"...

01:10:21.459 --> 01:10:23.620
is an unleashed sex fiend.

01:10:23.695 --> 01:10:26.220
Look. He will not leave me alone.
He thinks because I stay here...

01:10:26.297 --> 01:10:30.597
I am his love goddess,
his prostrate.

01:10:30.668 --> 01:10:32.636
No. Prostitute.

01:10:32.704 --> 01:10:36.731
Holy shit.
You big faker. You speak English.

01:10:36.808 --> 01:10:40.608
But of course I speak English.
I speak very good English.

01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:44.614
I will not, however,
speak Mrs. Smith's...

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:51.347
international language of love
with this reptilian son.

01:10:51.422 --> 01:10:54.585
Well, honk my hooter!

01:10:54.659 --> 01:10:57.958
I don't believe it. You've
understood everything we've said?

01:10:58.029 --> 01:11:01.556
Look, Lane. If you were living
with a family like that...

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:05.068
the less you spoke, the happier
you would be, I promise you.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.331
God, I never thought of that.

01:11:07.405 --> 01:11:10.431
I thought if Casanova and I
had nothing to say to each other...

01:11:10.508 --> 01:11:13.500
he'd get bored, go away.

01:11:13.578 --> 01:11:17.776
Instead, he used it as a chance
to put his testicles all over me.

01:11:17.849 --> 01:11:19.874
His what?

01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:23.819
How you say... octopus, testicles?

01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:27.153
Tentacles. "N-t." Tentacles.

01:11:27.225 --> 01:11:30.217
- Tentacles.
- There's a big difference.

01:11:30.294 --> 01:11:35.231
All I want is to come to the States
and see Dodger Stadium.

01:11:38.202 --> 01:11:42.070
Now all I see is that... that face
in my door every time I move.

01:11:43.808 --> 01:11:47.801
Dodgers, huh? I notice
you have a pretty good pitching arm.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.978
What else is there that is
of interest in the States...

01:11:52.049 --> 01:11:54.074
but the Brooklyn Dodgers?

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:58.288
I don't know.
You might find a nice friend.

01:11:59.957 --> 01:12:02.790
You do have friends in France?

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.454
You know... friend.

01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:08.963
Friend.

01:12:12.069 --> 01:12:15.300
- Then you will not tell?
- That you're a Dodgers fan?

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:18.467
No. That I speak English.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:21.171
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Do you?

01:12:22.613 --> 01:12:25.514
Not at the moment.

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:28.211
What are you doin' out here?
Do you know what time it is?

01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:30.550
Get in here before
you catch your death.

01:12:30.621 --> 01:12:32.555
Jesus.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:39.189
You are my friend. Good night.

01:12:40.431 --> 01:12:42.626
Good luck.

01:12:44.335 --> 01:12:47.133
Is that Myer boy bothering you?

01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:50.140
Little Ricky's been lookin'
all over for you.

01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:53.006
We've been worried sick.

01:13:02.687 --> 01:13:04.120
Damn.

01:13:37.954 --> 01:13:40.252
Hello? Hello?

01:13:43.826 --> 01:13:48.354
No, thanks. I already had breakfast.
What are you doing to my car?

01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:52.023
What are you doing to my Camaro?

01:13:52.101 --> 01:13:55.935
Monique, what are you doing
to my car? It's already screwed up.

01:13:56.005 --> 01:13:58.235
- "Screwed up"?
- Yeah. Very.

01:14:04.947 --> 01:14:09.350
You got my car running! You brought
my car back from the dead.

01:14:09.418 --> 01:14:11.147
- From the dead?
- Yeah.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:15.987
- Not entirely.
- Can you put that back in?

01:14:16.058 --> 01:14:18.492
Together? Where it goes?

01:14:18.561 --> 01:14:20.893
If I cannot,
I am sure you will.

01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:25.159
I have a great fear of tools. I once
made a birdhouse in wood shop...

01:14:25.234 --> 01:14:27.429
and the Fair Housing Committee
condemned it.

01:14:27.503 --> 01:14:30.199
"I cannot do it"
is your middle name.

01:14:30.273 --> 01:14:33.333
Come. Help me push this
into the garage.

01:15:34.503 --> 01:15:38.940
I think you're kind of remarkable.
How'd you learn to do all this?

01:15:40.409 --> 01:15:43.139
Some things are not that hard
to understand, Lane.

01:15:44.046 --> 01:15:47.504
Like you, for instance. You think of
these ways of killing yourself...

01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:49.574
yet you never do it.

01:15:49.652 --> 01:15:53.349
- Why is this?
- Isn't that kind of personal?

01:15:53.422 --> 01:15:59.190
But I told you the sordid details
of my intimate sex life with Ricky.

01:15:59.261 --> 01:16:02.788
I just figured you could
explain this dramatic death wish.

01:16:05.968 --> 01:16:08.698
I used to go out
with this girl named Beth.

01:16:09.772 --> 01:16:14.573
I really thought I loved her,
and she dumped me.

01:16:14.643 --> 01:16:17.510
And I guess I thought I couldn't
live without her or something.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.914
You would die to get the attention
of this woman?

01:16:23.552 --> 01:16:26.077
You know, Lane, there are better
ways of getting attention.

01:16:26.155 --> 01:16:30.751
Yeah. When she dumped me, she
dumped me for this real slimebag...

01:16:30.826 --> 01:16:33.556
a guy named Stalin.

01:16:36.732 --> 01:16:40.725
I race Stalin tomorrow. Oh, my God.
I have to get to a cave right now.

01:16:40.803 --> 01:16:42.896
No. This is what I speak of.

01:16:42.972 --> 01:16:47.033
This is good way of getting
this attention, when we beat him.

01:16:47.109 --> 01:16:50.476
- Beat him? I can't beat him.
- Yes!

01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:53.709
I think all you need
is a small taste of success.

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:56.377
You will find it suits you.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:58.973
Step up.

01:19:14.323 --> 01:19:16.086
One minute.

01:19:26.702 --> 01:19:28.135
Voilà.

01:19:44.486 --> 01:19:46.613
Hold that thought.

01:19:48.424 --> 01:19:50.221
I got these for Christmas.

01:19:53.329 --> 01:19:55.923
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

01:19:57.833 --> 01:20:01.098
Monique, I just wanted
to thank you for everything.

01:20:03.706 --> 01:20:05.731
<i>Merci</i> buckets.

01:20:10.212 --> 01:20:12.680
Wait. I forgot
the most important thing.

01:21:09.972 --> 01:21:13.203
Look at this! How am I supposed
to live through this?

01:21:14.477 --> 01:21:18.345
All you've got to do
is go that way really fast.

01:21:18.414 --> 01:21:21.975
If something gets
in your way, turn.

01:21:23.753 --> 01:21:26.381
Watch. It's no sweat.

01:21:48.444 --> 01:21:50.139
Now you!

01:21:52.348 --> 01:21:55.715
Hell, if you can do it...

01:22:35.291 --> 01:22:37.156
Lane, are you all right?

01:22:40.563 --> 01:22:42.656
You're mad about me, aren't you?

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm okay, really. Nothing's broken.
It's just a little... Thank you.

01:23:53.102 --> 01:23:58.665
I'm telling you, practically everybody
in the state of Northern California...

01:23:58.741 --> 01:24:04.179
is around this particular mountain
waiting to see one Lane Myer...

01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:09.684
tackle this totally
untamed slope, dead or alive.

01:24:09.752 --> 01:24:13.586
So get the lead out.
That is all.

01:24:23.032 --> 01:24:26.433
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Please hurry.

01:24:26.502 --> 01:24:30.836
We have unfinished business.
Do not forget.

01:24:32.908 --> 01:24:35.775
- Language lessons.
- You gonna teach me French?

01:24:35.844 --> 01:24:38.574
The international language.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.454
Kick his ass.

01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:56.397
Shit!

01:25:13.015 --> 01:25:16.542
I want my two dollars!

01:25:18.087 --> 01:25:19.748
Oh, my God.

01:25:26.128 --> 01:25:27.060
Two dollars!

01:25:29.898 --> 01:25:33.390
- I want my two dollars!
- Of course the guy chickened out.

01:25:33.469 --> 01:25:37.769
He's just a geek. Listen,
the wet wimp ain't gonna show up.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.037
Of course not. So what do you
want us to do? Pack it up?

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:44.307
<i>I tell you what. While I'm up here,</i>
<i>might as well break one more record.</i>

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.940
- We'll set the synchros for ya.
- <i>Ten-four.</i>

01:25:47.016 --> 01:25:49.211
<i>Spencer, we're gonna</i>
<i>send Roy down alone.</i>

01:25:49.285 --> 01:25:53.244
- <i>Looks like Myer is not gonna show.</i>
- Count me down.

01:25:54.356 --> 01:25:58.520
- Myer, you don't know when to quit.
- Myer's on the hill!

01:26:01.864 --> 01:26:03.832
- Two dollars!
- Go!

01:26:09.371 --> 01:26:10.338
Go!

01:26:18.213 --> 01:26:21.614
- He's skiing on one ski!
- What?

01:26:27.656 --> 01:26:31.387
Two dollars! Two dollars!

01:26:32.795 --> 01:26:36.162
- There's something following them.
- What?

01:26:40.702 --> 01:26:42.897
Two dollars!

01:26:46.475 --> 01:26:48.238
I want my two dollars!

01:26:50.712 --> 01:26:53.044
- I want my two dollars!
- Not now.

01:26:53.115 --> 01:26:54.912
Two dollars!

01:26:55.817 --> 01:27:01.016
Get out of here! Get lost! Get
out of here. Take a hike, brat.

01:27:17.639 --> 01:27:19.231
Two dollars.

01:28:01.283 --> 01:28:03.114
They're coming
out of the woods!

01:28:07.122 --> 01:28:11.718
Come on, little buckaroo!
Come on!

01:29:03.345 --> 01:29:07.805
You fiend! Man, you're
the hottest thing since sunburn!

01:29:11.153 --> 01:29:14.145
- Nice try.
- Get lost.

01:29:14.222 --> 01:29:16.986
Lane, you really are the best.

01:29:26.601 --> 01:29:29.968
- We've been worried about you.
- What are you doing up here?

01:29:30.038 --> 01:29:32.472
Do you know how long a drive
it is to get here?

01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:34.406
Get her skis.
We're goin' home.

01:29:35.877 --> 01:29:38.038
Excuse me.

01:29:39.114 --> 01:29:43.517
This was a sublime metamorphosis
of the Lane Myer...

01:29:43.585 --> 01:29:46.145
I think the crowds
were expecting to see here...

01:29:46.221 --> 01:29:48.712
at Brody Mountain today.

01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:51.987
Perhaps you can tell us
what brought on...

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:54.494
such an enchanting,
exhilarating fate?

01:29:55.497 --> 01:29:57.431
Language lessons.

01:30:02.404 --> 01:30:03.996
Language lessons.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:09.668
Inspired words from a man
who knows how to ski.

01:30:09.744 --> 01:30:12.076
You're nothing but a little tramp,
you know.

01:30:12.147 --> 01:30:15.981
I don't know what Ricky
even sees in you.

01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:18.076
- What are you doing with her?
- She's coming with me.

01:30:18.153 --> 01:30:20.053
- She's coming with us.
- Wrong.

01:30:20.121 --> 01:30:23.613
You would be wise
to do as Mother says, Myer.

01:30:23.692 --> 01:30:26.126
Do something to him.

01:30:38.006 --> 01:30:39.701
Son of a bitch!

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:43.935
Come on, honey!
Nail the sucker!

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:48.144
What are you doing to him?

01:30:48.216 --> 01:30:51.413
Come on. That's a boy.

01:30:57.993 --> 01:30:59.927
Come on.

01:32:16.938 --> 01:32:19.270
Ricky, where are you going?

01:32:20.305 --> 01:32:26.352
