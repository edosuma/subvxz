(Hanna sighs)

05:58.849 --> 06:00.554
What is this?

06:00.555 --> 06:01.388
Relax.

06:03.169 --> 06:05.486
Security police put us here.

06:05.487 --> 06:09.654
It's either a drill or they
moved some stuff around on base.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.209
Kind of messed up the way they do us,

06:15.210 --> 06:17.242
but it's procedure.

06:17.243 --> 06:19.379
They pretty much own you.

(container clanging)

06:45.537 --> 06:48.620
(low, intense music)

06:49.565 --> 06:51.405
It's been three hours.

06:51.406 --> 06:53.608
2 1/2.

06:53.609 --> 06:55.889
How long do we sit here?

06:55.890 --> 06:59.132
(low, intense music)

06:59.133 --> 07:00.133
What's that?

07:01.505 --> 07:04.933
This means I'm the procedure captain.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.624
What's your name?

07:06.625 --> 07:07.708
It's Hanna.

07:09.188 --> 07:12.011
(low, intense music)
(Gail coughing)

07:12.012 --> 07:14.788
Are you holding up, LT?

07:14.789 --> 07:15.706
I'm fine.

07:18.053 --> 07:19.599
That cough don't sound too good.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.767
You asthmatic?

07:22.547 --> 07:24.366
Just nauseous.

07:24.367 --> 07:25.200
Oh yeah?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.370
Hey, where do I know you from?

07:28.371 --> 07:29.693
Gail Sullivan.

07:29.694 --> 07:30.611
Ah, yeah!

07:31.447 --> 07:33.053
Special projects.

07:33.054 --> 07:35.216
We worked together a year ago.

07:35.217 --> 07:37.226
They still got you here, huh?

07:37.227 --> 07:41.394
I thought they sent you
off to Nellis or something.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.765
Russell Turner, civilian services.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.599
Nice to see you again.

07:51.225 --> 07:54.308
(low, intense music)

07:58.495 --> 08:02.662
(chair squeaks)
(low, intense music)

08:11.908 --> 08:14.847
(Russell sighs)

08:14.848 --> 08:16.846
So what's your story, Miss Hanna?

08:16.847 --> 08:19.930
(low, intense music)

08:21.602 --> 08:22.435
DOD.

08:23.725 --> 08:24.975
I'm an auditor.

08:25.889 --> 08:28.134
DOD?
(laughs)

08:28.135 --> 08:29.587
Seriously?

08:29.588 --> 08:30.886
Oh, shit.

08:30.887 --> 08:33.750
What they got you auditing?

08:33.751 --> 08:35.890
You shutting us down?

08:35.892 --> 08:37.921
No.
(laughs)

08:37.922 --> 08:40.532
Not that kind, I'm a security auditor.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.817
I brief Congress on national
security vulnerabilities,

08:42.818 --> 08:45.592
cyber security,
it's really boring stuff.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.426
Hmm.

08:47.548 --> 08:49.031
Yeah, well I was about to say,

08:49.032 --> 08:50.748
I have a year before I retire,

08:50.749 --> 08:54.178
so don't go laying me off
before I get there, now.

08:54.179 --> 08:56.240
That's somebody else's job.

08:56.241 --> 08:59.303
Now, if you're a security risk...

08:59.304 --> 09:00.137
Me?

09:01.019 --> 09:03.324
No way.
(laughs)

09:03.325 --> 09:04.158
No.

09:05.523 --> 09:10.002
I used to be with the
128th Airborne Command.

09:10.003 --> 09:13.148
Almost landed a job with the
Defense Department, actually.

09:13.149 --> 09:14.271
Buddy of mine...

09:14.272 --> 09:15.105
Really?

09:19.234 --> 09:21.182
Talking about our jobs?

09:21.183 --> 09:22.266
Life stories?

09:24.792 --> 09:26.901
I'm afraid it's against the protocol.

09:26.902 --> 09:27.734
Oh yeah?

09:27.735 --> 09:30.514
And what you know about that?

09:30.515 --> 09:32.571
Where you from?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.322
That accent, Russian?

09:37.279 --> 09:39.862
Ah, there's your security risk.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.919
What'd you do, comrade, jump ship?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.587
Uncle Sam promise you something?

09:49.527 --> 09:50.471
Oh well.

09:50.472 --> 09:52.339
Shit, I can't blame you.

09:52.340 --> 09:53.575
I've been to Russia.

09:53.576 --> 09:54.993
That's amazing.

09:56.222 --> 09:59.139
Is there anything you haven't done?

10:03.162 --> 10:07.329
(electricity buzzing)
(foreboding music)

10:21.779 --> 10:25.612
(foreboding orchestral music)

10:42.372 --> 10:43.853
So what's the score, man?

10:43.854 --> 10:44.757
Shh.

10:44.758 --> 10:49.019
Aw, come on, man, you know
something we should know?

10:49.020 --> 10:50.853
Backup generators.

10:50.854 --> 10:51.686
So what?

10:51.687 --> 10:53.761
Who gives a damn?

10:53.762 --> 10:56.004
We're not in the north side of the base.

10:56.005 --> 10:58.556
Aw, man, you're over-thinking it.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.224
We're underground.

11:02.118 --> 11:03.904
Hold up, man.

11:03.905 --> 11:04.738
Hold up.

11:05.888 --> 11:07.608
Just trying to figure out where we are.

11:07.609 --> 11:09.240
[Russell] Wait a minute, man.

11:09.241 --> 11:10.990
Dimitri is my name.

11:10.991 --> 11:11.823
Whatever.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.705
You open this door and
you expose the rest of us

11:13.706 --> 11:15.071
and I ain't letting that happen.

11:15.072 --> 11:17.562
Should be out there with my team.

11:17.563 --> 11:18.935
Right now, you're with my team

11:18.936 --> 11:20.923
and you're gonna follow protocol.

11:20.924 --> 11:22.186
Get back!

11:22.187 --> 11:24.363
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:24.364 --> 11:25.326
He's right.

11:25.327 --> 11:26.478
We don't know what's out there.

11:26.479 --> 11:28.956
It's better if we just sit
tight for a few more minutes.

11:28.957 --> 11:31.624
(ominous music)

12:03.810 --> 12:06.560

14:49.649 --> 14:53.816
(Gail screaming)
(foreboding music)

14:56.110 --> 14:57.752
That's okay, it's okay.

14:57.753 --> 14:59.354
Grab her legs.

14:59.355 --> 15:00.898
[Russell] Relax, relax.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.624
(foreboding music)
(Gail grunting and crying)

15:02.625 --> 15:03.792
You're fine.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.554
Shh.
(foreboding music)

15:09.473 --> 15:10.884
Hey.

15:10.885 --> 15:11.933
- Hey, you little fucker.
- Hey.

15:11.934 --> 15:12.946
Get back.

15:12.947 --> 15:14.474
(foreboding music)

15:14.475 --> 15:15.307
Move.

15:15.308 --> 15:16.407
It ain't gonna happen, not on my watch.

15:16.408 --> 15:18.628
I need some help here.

15:18.629 --> 15:21.419
(dramatic music)
(men grunting)

15:21.420 --> 15:23.213
Son of a, get the fuck back.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.964
(dramatic music)

15:30.311 --> 15:32.093
Calm the fuck down.

15:32.094 --> 15:34.844
(dramatic music)

15:39.531 --> 15:40.364
Stop!

15:43.124 --> 15:44.255
I'm okay.

15:44.256 --> 15:47.006
(dramatic music)

16:34.498 --> 16:35.883
What's up?

16:35.884 --> 16:38.634
(dramatic music)

16:43.007 --> 16:46.478
Generators shouldn't be running means...

16:46.479 --> 16:49.136
There is no power on the base.

16:49.137 --> 16:51.804
(ominous music)

16:53.767 --> 16:56.234
What do you remember from this morning?

16:56.635 --> 17:00.809
I don't remember anybody
drugging me or bringing me here.

17:00.810 --> 17:03.034
What day is today?

17:03.035 --> 17:04.632
Thursday.

17:04.633 --> 17:05.800
It's Monday.

17:09.460 --> 17:13.627
This morning, I had a breakfast
with my younger brother.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.992
He's been dead for five years.

17:20.631 --> 17:24.500
This morning didn't happen
the way we remember it.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.251
(ethereal music)

17:31.331 --> 17:32.467
[Gail] You're dismissing me.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.422
LT, I'm not dismissing you.

17:34.423 --> 17:35.547
Trust me, I wouldn't do that.

17:35.548 --> 17:38.056
[Gail] I was all by myself.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.855
[Russell]
No one has left the room.

17:41.856 --> 17:42.689
Here.

17:43.205 --> 17:45.036
Will you look?

17:45.337 --> 17:46.170
Look.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.011
Is there a Mr. Sullivan
I should be worried about?

17:48.412 --> 17:50.033
[Gail] Will you just look please?

17:50.034 --> 17:51.438
(sighs) Oh, okay.

17:51.439 --> 17:52.550
What am I looking for?

17:52.551 --> 17:54.941
[Gail] Something like right here.

17:54.942 --> 17:55.775
Somewhere.

17:57.465 --> 18:00.175
- Do you see it?
- Ah, wait, wait, wait.

18:00.176 --> 18:01.712
I think you're right.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.237
[Gail] What?

18:03.238 --> 18:05.826
You do have something there.

18:05.827 --> 18:07.338
[Gail] What?

18:07.339 --> 18:08.256
What is it?

18:09.668 --> 18:11.172
Right here.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.352
A hickey.

18:12.353 --> 18:15.572
(dramatic music)

18:15.573 --> 18:16.702
Relax, there's nothing there.

18:16.703 --> 18:17.567
[Gail] Forget it.

18:17.568 --> 18:20.424
- Come on now.
- No, it's fine.

18:20.425 --> 18:21.257
Come on, LT.

18:21.258 --> 18:22.857
Forget it.

18:22.858 --> 18:27.025
(Dimitri whistling)
(zipper hissing)

18:30.055 --> 18:30.887
Hey!

18:30.888 --> 18:32.244
What the hell are you doing?

18:32.245 --> 18:35.307
What does it look like I'm doing?

18:35.308 --> 18:37.908
You got two ladies in here, man.

18:38.309 --> 18:40.476
Oh, sorry, Mr. Boss Man.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.977
Do you mind if I take a piss?

18:42.978 --> 18:44.419
(zipper hissing)

18:44.420 --> 18:46.068
Or should I hold it
for another four hours?

18:46.069 --> 18:47.488
You little bastard.

18:47.489 --> 18:50.235
(mechanical clanging)

18:50.236 --> 18:54.991
(people screaming)
(guns shooting)

18:54.992 --> 18:58.361

(guns shooting)

18:58.362 --> 19:02.529
(alien growling)
(electricity buzzing)

19:08.041 --> 19:09.705
Okay, everybody just stay put.

19:09.706 --> 19:10.538
[Hanna] Wait.

19:10.539 --> 19:12.956
[Dimitri] Everyone shut up.

19:14.827 --> 19:16.910
[Russell] We just wait.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.911
[Dimitri] There goes the gennies.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.459
[Russell] Relax.

19:37.397 --> 19:39.856
(mechanical clanging)
(electricity buzzing)

19:39.857 --> 19:41.015
[Hanna] They're coming back on.

19:41.016 --> 19:43.599
Okay, okay.

19:47.194 --> 19:48.619
All right.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.370
(dramatic music)

19:52.357 --> 19:55.024
(intense music)

20:00.324 --> 20:02.907
(men grunting)

20:06.754 --> 20:09.421
(intense music)

20:10.458 --> 20:11.823
Get off of me!

20:11.824 --> 20:12.977
Go!

20:12.978 --> 20:15.645
(intense music)

20:17.330 --> 20:19.166
Hanna, don't!

20:19.167 --> 20:20.366
We don't know what's out there!

20:20.367 --> 20:21.520
We don't know shit.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.672
(dramatic music)

20:24.673 --> 20:26.305
Mother fucker.

20:26.306 --> 20:27.360
Think about it!

20:27.361 --> 20:29.221
- You're making a mistake!
- Go, it's your chance!

20:29.222 --> 20:33.389
(dramatic music)
(alien growling)

20:40.180 --> 20:43.847
(dramatic orchestral music)

21:03.861 --> 21:04.694
Hello?

21:06.005 --> 21:06.837
Hello?

21:06.838 --> 21:08.588
Is anyone down there?

21:10.723 --> 21:13.306
(door rattles)

21:14.420 --> 21:15.808
Hello?

21:15.809 --> 21:17.114
SP, open up!

21:17.115 --> 21:19.725
SP, identify yourself.

21:19.726 --> 21:21.314
Master Sergeant Pierce.

21:21.315 --> 21:23.341
Open the door!
(door rattling)

21:23.342 --> 21:26.729
This is serious shit, open the door.

21:26.730 --> 21:28.399
(door rattling)
This is not a fucking drill.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.850
Open the door!
(door rattling)

21:29.851 --> 21:33.928
(dramatic music)
(alien growling)

21:33.929 --> 21:36.073
Come on, open up!
(dramatic music)

21:36.074 --> 21:37.037
Open the door, god damn it!

21:37.038 --> 21:40.114
(dramatic music)
(door rattling)

21:40.115 --> 21:42.027
Open the door!

21:42.028 --> 21:45.070
(dramatic music)

21:45.071 --> 21:46.571
SP, open the door.

21:48.005 --> 21:52.172
(dramatic music)
(door rattling)

21:54.754 --> 21:57.918
[Russell]
Get the weapon, get the weapon.

21:57.919 --> 22:00.545
(dramatic music)

22:00.546 --> 22:01.926
(gun clicks)

22:01.927 --> 22:04.523
(dramatic music)

22:04.524 --> 22:06.073
Why were you running?

22:06.074 --> 22:07.205
Hey.

22:07.206 --> 22:09.514
He asked you a question.

22:09.515 --> 22:11.594
[Russell]
You were running from somebody, man.

22:11.595 --> 22:14.284
There's a patrol about 15 minutes out.

22:14.285 --> 22:16.565
What's your SC, Master Sergeant?

22:16.566 --> 22:18.559
Level five under CCL.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.818
Can you radio 'em?

22:19.819 --> 22:21.194
(radio clattering)

22:21.195 --> 22:22.028
Here.

22:23.198 --> 22:24.138
Have at it.

22:24.139 --> 22:25.806
They're blacked out.

22:31.038 --> 22:32.889
Base command, Lieutenant Gail Sullivan.

22:32.890 --> 22:34.550
Do you read? Over.

22:34.551 --> 22:36.875
Base command, do you read?

22:36.876 --> 22:38.143
- Over.
- They know where we are.

22:38.144 --> 22:39.973
They'll get to us.

22:39.974 --> 22:42.274
Can you at least tell
us the classification?

22:42.275 --> 22:43.108
Reno.

22:44.998 --> 22:46.941
Classification for what?

22:46.942 --> 22:49.641
Means the base has been evacuated.

22:49.642 --> 22:50.846
But why?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.159
Why were we sent here?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.241
It doesn't matter.

22:53.242 --> 22:55.328
We're safe here.

22:55.329 --> 22:56.662
No, we're not.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.099
- LT.
- Hey.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.017
I'm fine.

23:04.131 --> 23:07.364
I said I'm fine.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.454
They'll come get us,
we just gotta stay put.

23:09.455 --> 23:10.955
No one's coming.

23:14.445 --> 23:16.647
We're in south secondary.

23:16.648 --> 23:19.398
(dramatic music)

23:24.364 --> 23:25.486
(gun clicks)

23:25.487 --> 23:26.787
There are tunnels,

23:26.788 --> 23:31.247
about five more stories
underground from where we are.

23:31.248 --> 23:34.621
They go all the way to gate one.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.622
That's the only way out.

23:38.545 --> 23:41.462
I'm sure that's how they got us in.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.986
You think it's a good idea to leave?

23:45.387 --> 23:47.973
I mean, what if he's telling the truth?

23:47.974 --> 23:50.215
We don't know what's out there.

23:50.216 --> 23:52.799
Not sending a unit down here.

23:54.718 --> 23:56.385
It's a one-way trip.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.266
(dramatic music)

24:00.267 --> 24:02.934
(Gail coughing)

24:09.838 --> 24:12.468
How long has she been like this?

24:12.469 --> 24:14.444
[Russell] No idea.

24:14.445 --> 24:17.755
(dramatic music)

24:17.756 --> 24:21.006
How far away from accessing the digs?

24:24.805 --> 24:27.138
The elevator, how far is it?

24:30.183 --> 24:32.882
You're in this shit with the rest of us.

24:32.883 --> 24:35.312
You think it matters?

24:35.313 --> 24:37.678
Court Martial's the last
thing you need to worry about,

24:37.679 --> 24:39.743
that's for sure.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.469
You don't wanna go
through those tunnels.

24:41.470 --> 24:43.392
You go down there, you won't come back.

24:43.393 --> 24:45.584
You came in that way.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.426
Honestly, I have no idea.

24:48.427 --> 24:51.257
All I know is I woke up and here I am.

24:51.258 --> 24:53.693
Then help us find another way.

24:53.694 --> 24:54.526
Go yourself.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.030
Good luck.

24:56.031 --> 24:57.005
You're hiding something.

24:57.006 --> 24:57.838
Oh am I?

24:57.839 --> 24:59.057
Tell me.

24:59.058 --> 25:01.011
Then why were we brought here?

25:01.012 --> 25:02.334
I don't have to answer to you.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.997
You have to answer to me.

25:03.998 --> 25:06.627
(dramatic music)

25:06.628 --> 25:08.371
You're gonna lead us out.

25:08.372 --> 25:11.583
With all due respect, Lieutenant,

25:11.584 --> 25:14.001
I think I'll stay right here.

25:14.923 --> 25:16.196
Or not.

25:16.197 --> 25:18.947
(dramatic music)

25:20.986 --> 25:24.767
You shouldn't have left
your team, Master Sergeant.

25:24.768 --> 25:27.518
(dramatic music)

25:30.615 --> 25:33.365
(metal clanging)

25:34.215 --> 25:36.965
(ethereal music)

27:03.974 --> 27:08.141
(buttons clicking)
(ethereal music)

27:11.695 --> 27:13.612
Base is on lock down.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.761
What about the stairs?

27:15.762 --> 27:19.793
No, those just lead to
the second level offices.

27:19.794 --> 27:22.974
This is the only way
down to those tunnels.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.642
Then I need to get inside that panel.

27:25.643 --> 27:28.393
(ethereal music)

27:41.816 --> 27:44.462
(light switch clicks)

27:44.463 --> 27:47.213
(ethereal music)

27:58.642 --> 27:59.788
(phone handset clattering)

27:59.789 --> 28:01.554
How much time do you need?

28:01.555 --> 28:02.773
I don't know.

28:02.774 --> 28:04.138
[Gail] I'll be fine.

28:04.139 --> 28:06.227
Do what you gotta do.

28:06.228 --> 28:08.243
[Russell] I ain't leaving you, LT.

28:08.244 --> 28:10.293
I'll just lay down.

28:10.294 --> 28:12.002
No, I'll stay with you.

28:12.003 --> 28:14.009
They need you more than I do.

28:14.010 --> 28:15.093
I'll be fine.

28:17.098 --> 28:18.848
We'll be okay here.

28:19.896 --> 28:24.063
(dramatic music)
(cabinets clattering)

28:27.946 --> 28:32.113
(tools clattering)
(dramatic music)

28:47.760 --> 28:49.343
Let's go.

28:49.344 --> 28:52.094
(dramatic music)

29:31.058 --> 29:33.025
(door clicking)

29:33.026 --> 29:35.776
(dramatic music)

29:54.077 --> 29:56.204
(Hanna gasps)

29:56.205 --> 29:58.721
(dramatic music)

29:58.722 --> 30:02.818
(metallic clanging)
(Hanna gasps)

30:02.819 --> 30:05.569
(dramatic music)

30:08.240 --> 30:11.289
[Emily] Mama, where you going?

30:11.290 --> 30:14.160
(dramatic music)

30:14.161 --> 30:15.169
Hello?

30:15.170 --> 30:17.920
(dramatic music)

30:42.099 --> 30:43.994
(metal clanging)

30:43.995 --> 30:47.030
(Hanna gasps)

30:47.031 --> 30:49.781
(dramatic music)

30:53.611 --> 30:55.783
(metal clangs)

30:55.784 --> 30:59.951
(Hanna breathing heavily)
(dramatic music)

31:07.201 --> 31:10.691
(Hanna exclaims)

31:10.692 --> 31:14.192
(Hanna breathing heavily)

31:18.518 --> 31:20.935
(Gail sighs)

31:39.958 --> 31:42.958
Haven't had to wear regs in years.

31:47.289 --> 31:49.956
How long has this been going on?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.207
A few hours.

31:58.929 --> 32:01.162
Where did you say
you worked before this?

32:01.163 --> 32:02.080
I didn't.

32:05.461 --> 32:06.878
Special projects.

32:09.428 --> 32:13.595
[Ryan] And how long have you
been stationed here?

32:15.227 --> 32:16.227
18 months.

32:22.883 --> 32:25.633
(dramatic music)

32:33.730 --> 32:37.897
(metal clanging)
(dramatic music)

32:44.260 --> 32:46.476
(Gail gasps)

32:46.477 --> 32:49.227
(dramatic music)

32:59.698 --> 33:01.422
There's nothing you can do for them now.

33:01.423 --> 33:03.010
We have to warn them.

33:03.011 --> 33:05.316
We should go back to
the containment room.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.122
Get out of my way.

33:07.123 --> 33:10.290
(low, intense music)

33:20.405 --> 33:22.238
Out and to the left.

33:23.184 --> 33:26.267
(low, intense music)

34:14.587 --> 34:16.597
(door slams)

34:16.598 --> 34:19.348
(dramatic music)

34:22.275 --> 34:24.069
(door handle rattles)

34:24.469 --> 34:26.010
Open the door.

34:26.011 --> 34:28.567
(dramatic music)

34:28.568 --> 34:30.150
What are you doing?

34:31.449 --> 34:32.917
Open the door!

34:32.918 --> 34:35.668
(dramatic music)

34:38.654 --> 34:40.588
(hand slams against door)

34:40.589 --> 34:43.339
(dramatic music)

34:45.130 --> 34:48.699
Hey, guys, I think we
need to be heading back.

34:48.701 --> 34:51.253
(metal creaking)

34:51.254 --> 34:53.891
(dramatic music)

34:53.891 --> 34:55.456
(metal clanging)

34:55.458 --> 34:58.544
(dramatic music)

34:58.545 --> 35:02.712
(Gail sighing)
(dramatic music)

35:20.201 --> 35:24.368
(Gail breathing heavily)
(dramatic music)

35:28.966 --> 35:33.892
(footsteps clattering)
(dramatic music)

35:33.893 --> 35:38.060
(alien growling)
(dramatic music)

36:01.467 --> 36:03.303
(Hanna groans)

36:03.304 --> 36:06.054
(dramatic music)

36:09.904 --> 36:13.191
(door handle clicking)

36:13.192 --> 36:14.399
Open the door!

36:14.400 --> 36:17.397
(dramatic music)
(door handle clicking)

36:17.998 --> 36:19.831
Open the fucking door!

36:22.526 --> 36:24.351
- Open the damn door!
- (banging on door)

36:24.352 --> 36:27.102
(dramatic music)

36:30.370 --> 36:34.077
(door squeaks)
(dramatic music)

36:34.078 --> 36:37.411
(all breathing heavily)

36:52.139 --> 36:54.889
(alien gurgling)

37:05.360 --> 37:09.193
(metal clanging and rattling)

38:00.325 --> 38:03.408
(low, intense music)

38:21.134 --> 38:23.005
Where's Gail?

38:23.006 --> 38:24.940
(dramatic music)

38:24.941 --> 38:26.191
Where is she?

38:27.026 --> 38:27.859
I tried.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.474
She panicked.

38:33.169 --> 38:35.802
You had one fucking job, man.

38:35.803 --> 38:38.621
[Russell]
What the hell are you talking about?

38:38.622 --> 38:40.317
What was I supposed to do?

38:40.318 --> 38:42.273
You were supposed to stay together.

38:42.274 --> 38:43.702
I couldn't control her.

38:43.703 --> 38:46.210
I'm not gonna ask you again.

38:46.211 --> 38:48.703
Look, what do you want me to say?

38:48.704 --> 38:50.037
She flipped out.

38:51.004 --> 38:51.836
I couldn't keep her in the room

38:51.837 --> 38:53.482
without hurting her and making it worse.

38:53.483 --> 38:55.164
You should have done something!

38:55.165 --> 38:56.248
She's sick.

38:57.319 --> 38:58.736
Don't you get it?

39:00.599 --> 39:02.365
She's a lost cause.

39:02.366 --> 39:03.527
The fuck you say?

39:03.528 --> 39:04.360
What the fuck...

39:04.361 --> 39:07.123
Hey, hey, hey, whoa whoa.

39:07.124 --> 39:08.763
Her name is Gail.

39:08.764 --> 39:11.052
Yeah and she knows exactly
what she's up against.

39:11.053 --> 39:14.938
(low, intense music)

39:14.939 --> 39:17.522
She knows more than any of you.

39:20.022 --> 39:21.522
Not necessarily.

39:24.768 --> 39:27.330
(Hanna sighs)

39:27.331 --> 39:29.248
I'm one of five groups.

39:31.817 --> 39:33.900
Been here since the '50s.

39:35.447 --> 39:38.350
We needed their technology,
you know, so...

39:38.351 --> 39:39.949
What do they want?

39:39.950 --> 39:40.950
To evolve.

39:42.957 --> 39:44.229
Which is why they're becoming

39:44.230 --> 39:47.035
faster, smarter, and a lot more hostile.

39:47.036 --> 39:50.703
Jesus, that girl is
down there by herself.

39:54.218 --> 39:55.754
Don't even think about it.

39:55.755 --> 39:57.368
[Russell]
We can't do her like that, man.

39:57.369 --> 39:58.870
You can hardly walk.

39:58.871 --> 40:01.954
(low, intense music)

40:06.871 --> 40:08.363
Stay here, I'll go get her.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.892
No, we need you to get
that elevator working.

40:10.893 --> 40:12.060
I'll find her.

40:13.439 --> 40:15.312
Come on, I can do this.

40:15.313 --> 40:16.333
(gun clicks)

40:16.334 --> 40:18.654
- I'll go with you.
- No, it'll be all right.

40:18.655 --> 40:21.422
(low, intense music)

40:21.423 --> 40:23.423
Why are we wasting time?

40:24.430 --> 40:25.847
It's on safety.

40:27.241 --> 40:29.506
[Russell]
You better hope to god I find her.

40:29.507 --> 40:30.970
Hurry up, you ass.

40:30.971 --> 40:35.110
(door clangs and squeaks)

44:36.948 --> 44:38.160
You'll just lead them back here.

44:38.161 --> 44:39.635
Move!

44:39.636 --> 44:41.122
He's right.

44:41.123 --> 44:44.290
(low, intense music)

44:45.303 --> 44:47.011
I can take care of myself.

44:47.012 --> 44:48.851
You go, you're as good as dead.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.970
Get out of the way.

44:50.971 --> 44:52.575
Get off her.

44:52.576 --> 44:55.659
(low, intense music)

45:06.756 --> 45:08.209
You're bleeding.

45:08.210 --> 45:10.877
(ominous music)

45:11.882 --> 45:13.120
Your neck.

45:13.121 --> 45:15.788
(ominous music)

45:19.874 --> 45:22.214
[Dimitri] It's nothing.

45:22.215 --> 45:24.485
I just need a minute.

45:24.486 --> 45:27.799

47:16.995 --> 47:18.995
Why would you do that?

47:19.905 --> 47:21.738
Why would you do that?

47:23.301 --> 47:24.700
Dimitri, why would you do that?

47:24.701 --> 47:25.981
Why what?

47:25.982 --> 47:28.649
(ominous music)

47:36.625 --> 47:38.259
I had no choice.

47:38.260 --> 47:40.843
(somber music)

47:48.489 --> 47:52.144
There was this lake near
my house when I was young.

47:52.145 --> 47:54.728
(somber music)

47:55.618 --> 47:57.671
Frozen during the winter.

47:57.672 --> 48:00.848
(somber music)

48:00.849 --> 48:02.918
Went to that lake 100 times
with my brother.

48:02.919 --> 48:06.335
This one day, we wanted to cross it.
(somber music)

48:08.100 --> 48:10.108
I was so scared so...

48:10.109 --> 48:13.334
(somber music)

48:13.335 --> 48:14.292
He went.

48:14.293 --> 48:16.876
(somber music)

48:18.511 --> 48:21.839
I remember the sound
of the ice cracking.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.423
(somber music)

48:25.736 --> 48:26.674
He fell in.

48:26.675 --> 48:29.258
(somber music)

48:31.170 --> 48:34.837
Slipped underneath the ice and...

48:36.651 --> 48:39.234
(somber music)
I couldn't...

48:40.469 --> 48:41.598
I...

48:41.599 --> 48:44.182
(somber music)

48:48.172 --> 48:51.054
Up and out of nowhere,
he dashed across the ice.

48:51.055 --> 48:53.222
Pull him out, his lungs...

48:54.704 --> 48:56.743
Filled with frozen water.

48:56.744 --> 48:59.327
(somber music)

49:00.775 --> 49:02.840
'Cause I did nothing, my brother

49:02.841 --> 49:05.304
was sick the rest of his life.

49:05.305 --> 49:06.981
He was never the same after that.

49:06.982 --> 49:09.728
(somber music)

49:09.729 --> 49:11.232
Neither was I.

49:11.233 --> 49:13.246
(somber music)

49:13.247 --> 49:15.144
My brother didn't die that day.

49:15.145 --> 49:15.978
But I did.

49:17.730 --> 49:20.397
Guess we all have that regret.

49:24.810 --> 49:27.111
You know where I was this morning?

49:27.112 --> 49:30.494
(somber music)

49:30.495 --> 49:33.615
I was driving my daughter
Emily to her father's.

49:33.616 --> 49:36.997
(somber music)

49:36.998 --> 49:39.174
I'm lucky if I see her once a month.

49:39.175 --> 49:42.292
(somber music)

49:42.293 --> 49:44.769
I work all the time.

49:44.770 --> 49:47.439
(somber music)

49:47.440 --> 49:48.940
So I just think...

49:50.257 --> 49:52.727
Someday it'll be worth it.

49:52.728 --> 49:55.311
(somber music)

49:57.879 --> 50:00.212
I just wish I had more time.

50:02.490 --> 50:05.197
I don't think I'm gonna get that chance.

50:05.198 --> 50:07.781
(somber music)

50:08.964 --> 50:09.964
I'm close.

50:11.700 --> 50:12.867
That elevator.

50:14.081 --> 50:16.331
I can bypass the shut-down.

50:17.437 --> 50:19.692
I need you to cover me.

50:19.693 --> 50:21.538
