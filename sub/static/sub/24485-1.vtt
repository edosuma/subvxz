15:13.497 --> 15:14.498
TETÉ: Come on.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.377
KIKO: We are supposed to run.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.840
Come on, go. Run, run, run.

15:23.424 --> 15:25.133
What?

15:34.643 --> 15:37.479
Oh, shit! We got
Dawson's Creek up in here.

15:37.563 --> 15:40.189
Come on.
MARISOL: He's coming, Kiko!

15:40.273 --> 15:41.983
Get behind the counter.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.152
Marisol, what were you doing?

15:44.235 --> 15:45.779
Nothing. I just smiled at him.

15:45.863 --> 15:46.905
(MOCKING)
Nothing, I just smiled at him.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.532
KIKO: Hey!
MARISOL: Shut up!

15:49.700 --> 15:51.452
(MARISOL WHISPERING)
Stop.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.620
(KIKO MOCKING) I didn't...
He is here!

15:54.538 --> 15:55.997
Are you crazy?
(MARISOL WHISPERING) My God.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.333
He is gorgeous.
He is white.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.127
MARISOL: And?
Once you go white...

16:01.210 --> 16:03.464
That's "black", Mensa.
(MARISOL AND TETÉ LAUGHING)

16:03.547 --> 16:05.089
KIKO: Don't you dare.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.634
Try me.
KIKO: Fine.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.013
Hi.
Hi.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.306
What are you doing here?

16:13.389 --> 16:14.850
I didn't know you worked here.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.852
Yeah, I don't.

16:17.686 --> 16:22.064
I work at the mall...
but... can I get you anything?

16:22.148 --> 16:25.569
No, I just... wanted to come by
to see if I could get something.

16:26.152 --> 16:30.114
What exactly is it
that you are... trying to get?

16:32.366 --> 16:35.161
Well... I was hoping to get a kiss.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.875
Right.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.726
Let's go, let's go.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.770
KIKO: Come on.
TETÉ: Let's go.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.815
(LAUGHTER)

17:08.529 --> 17:09.820
MARISOL: Oh, my God.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.827
(KIKO BREATHING HEAVILY) My God.
You are insane.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.079
You don't even know him.
What good did that do you?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.874
MARISOL: I just gave him a kiss.
TETÉ: He's coming.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.003
TETÉ: Guys, he's coming.
KIKO: He's here.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.255
KIKO: Hi, Ramón.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.467
BOY: Hey!
KIKO: Go, go, go.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.804
GAVIN: Come on.
RAMÓN: Where did you come from?

17:33.887 --> 17:37.265
GAVIN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't want to fight you, alright?

17:37.348 --> 17:38.349
Don't do this, bro.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.351
MARISOL: Ramón!
Stop, Ramón.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.228
GAVIN: I don't want to fight, alright?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.521
BOY: Let's go. Come on.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.773
What's wrong with you.
RAMÓN: What the fuck?

17:44.856 --> 17:48.484
(EVERYBODY SCREAMING)

17:48.569 --> 17:49.570
He tried to hit him.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.863
Are you gonna trust the blonde?
OFFICER: Let's go.

17:51.947 --> 17:53.447
MARISOL: Genaro, get out of here.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.366
Hey, hey, hey!
She didn't do anything!

17:55.449 --> 17:57.869
They just attacked you, Gavin.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.537
What's going on here?

17:59.621 --> 18:02.164
These homeboys were bugging us.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.085
Okay, we'll get you out. Now.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.213
Come on. Let's go.
Hey! She didn't do anything!

18:09.297 --> 18:10.716
RAMÓN: You're a traitor!

18:11.299 --> 18:13.719
Fucking whitties!
Oh, fuck!

18:17.681 --> 18:18.724
LUKE: Come on.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.726
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.026
MAN: Thank you, Lord, for these
Thy gifts we're about to receive.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.819
In Jesus' name we pray.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.738
Amen.
ALL: Amen.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.704
How was the congressman, today, Tricia?

18:42.538 --> 18:45.876
He's fine. Went to DC
for this big meeting they had

18:45.959 --> 18:47.126
with some of the people
from the Tea Party.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.587
They don't want the bill either.

18:49.671 --> 18:53.549
Yessiree, can't have
eleven million spics legalized...

18:53.634 --> 18:56.218
We won't have a wall
big enough to keep them out.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.849
My unemployment check stopped.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.853
Again? No, that's a mistake.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.521
It's not a mistake. I got the notice.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.275
They're not coming anymore.
But you are entitled to that money.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.986
Damn it. What did I just say?

19:13.945 --> 19:15.906
The business is gone.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.866
It's been gone for two years.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.535
Compensation's run out.
Give it a rest.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.043
Guess what, Mom.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.461
We ran into one of those Mexican gangs
at the amusement park today.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.963
Stop it, Amber.

19:32.047 --> 19:34.465
Gangs?
What are you talking about?

19:34.548 --> 19:37.551
Yeah, you know.
Like the ones you see cruising Valencia.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.220
Amber, I said shut the fuck up!
Hey!

19:39.303 --> 19:42.515
Watch that yap hole
or I'll shut it for you.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.476
What were you saying?
Nothing.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.938
Just some wetback bugged us
at the amusement park today.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.315
You provoked them, Amber.
I did not. Stop defending them.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.943
You defended them?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.445
Did you?

19:57.321 --> 19:59.074
Answer me!

19:59.157 --> 20:00.784
Just forget it, Dad.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.631
KIKO: What...? Hey!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.932
What's the deal
with the gringo, cousin?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.768
How do you know about that?

20:26.852 --> 20:28.729
What if my uncle finds out about it?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.690
Yeah. I kissed a gringo.

20:33.734 --> 20:34.985
So what?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.154
In a square, Marisol!

20:37.236 --> 20:40.031
It doesn't matter where.
Forget about it.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.992
Ramón is your boyfriend.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.995
He's not my boyfriend,
he's a macho.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.832
Where I come from,
that goes a long way, cousin.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.460
Back there, either you defend
yourself and become a macho...

20:53.502 --> 20:56.464
or you get killed.
Or you become like them.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.885
Will you see the gringo again?

21:01.719 --> 21:02.763
No.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.016
MARISOL: Don't worry.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.852
What's with you, nosy?
What are you doing here?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.269
KIKO: Hey!

21:11.229 --> 21:13.231
I don't like that.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.025
Did you scold her?

21:15.108 --> 21:16.734
She won't see that gringo again.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.487
They are just people, Dad.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.280
They are trying to get by,
just like us.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.910
They are not like us!
They are like the goddamn Talibans!

21:24.993 --> 21:27.703
Oh, come on!
Don't start with me, old man.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.705
Well, they are not going anywhere,
are they, Dad?

21:29.790 --> 21:31.875
So might as well get
used to living with them.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.459
This is shit!
TRICIA: Earl...

21:35.253 --> 21:37.338
Why are you talking to him like that?
You know he's ruined by those people.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.757
They are not terrorists, Mom.
I know that!

21:41.717 --> 21:43.636
You are too young
to understand, Gavin.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.142
Soon one of them will be screwing, Gav.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.564

What's up!

22:56.792 --> 22:58.253
RAMÓN: Cool.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.046
There she is.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.477
Work with me.

23:15.561 --> 23:19.107
Come on, dude.
Chill. I'll work with you later.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.984
You swear?

23:21.775 --> 23:23.444
Yeah, I pinky swear.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.368
I know that guy.

23:30.451 --> 23:31.660
Marisol.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.915
I know that guy.

23:37.541 --> 23:38.919
Answer me, Marisol!

23:41.212 --> 23:43.422
Is that fucking gringo, isn't it, huh?

23:45.175 --> 23:48.427
Yeah. Well, you wanted to kill him
so bad, his face got stuck on me, okay?

23:48.510 --> 23:49.803
That's you over there.

Come on.
Ramón, we are gonna fall!

24:06.196 --> 24:08.906
Come on, I want to do it
with you tonight.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.992
Let her go. She said no.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.621
This is not your town, bro.
GENARO: Here and anywhere.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.456
If you don't like it...

24:18.959 --> 24:21.127
The thing is I'm crazy about her...

24:22.003 --> 24:23.712
that's why I control myself.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.092
But don't go too far, honey.

24:37.685 --> 24:38.979
Boo!

Why are you being so secretive?
Would you tell me what we're doing here?

25:14.431 --> 25:16.765
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.019
Is that beaner chick?
Come on, man.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.686
That kind of talk's gonna
get you killed out here.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.564
No, what's gonna get you killed
is your obsession with that girl, bro.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.566
I think I'm gonna ask Chrissy out.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.069

Watch yourself!

25:28.153 --> 25:30.863
How do you know she even works here?
I know she works here.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.490
I can feel it.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.826
You haven't seen him again, have you?
No, I haven't.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.496
I know I will. I can feel it.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.915
What a kiss, huh?
Yeah.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.503
What about you?

25:45.586 --> 25:48.630
You're into Genaro, right?
I may fuck him.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.301
Shh, girl! Don't be talking like that!
I may!

25:51.384 --> 25:53.677
You? Are you gonna do it
with Ramón

25:53.761 --> 25:55.096
or are you saving your first time
for the gringo?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.014
Not here!

25:57.098 --> 26:00.268
You are gonna lose it sooner or later.
I just say fuck them both!

she even works here?

26:05.022 --> 26:07.067
Just know, man. I know it.

26:07.150 --> 26:10.278
Chasing Mexican tail around the mall
is gonna get you killed.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.997
She's gotta be here.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.459
I know she's here. I can feel it.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.627
You are on drugs, man.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.921
Feels good, though, doesn't it?

26:29.506 --> 26:32.591
I don't know what happened.
I felt that she was here.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.135
I'm sorry.

You can't drink here.

I don't know you.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.657
Okay, move. Come on, move.

you'll be right back?

Red hots?
Those spit fire things?

27:48.376 --> 27:51.337
No, no, no. Come here.
I'm gonna show you how to do it.

Take a little bit of...
let's call it bubblegum flavor.

Maybe a little green apple.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.891
Why did you kiss me
the other day?

28:47.644 --> 28:48.894
Because somebody said I shouldn't.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.480
Oh, it was a dare.

Where did you go?

What do you mean where did I go?
I saw her.

Yeah.

Work is work.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.756
I'm not your uncle here,
I'm your boss.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.173
Be certain of it.

30:00.257 --> 30:03.553
You can't leave the store
to go chase a gringo?

30:03.636 --> 30:04.637
Do you think it's okay?

30:04.721 --> 30:07.097
I don't think it's okay at all.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.476
This is your life
and this is your problem.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.521
Okay? Okay.
Yeah.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.107
What happened? Tell me.

30:17.734 --> 30:21.529
He kisses like... so...

30:21.612 --> 30:23.030
Oh, my God!

30:23.113 --> 30:24.114
(BOTH SCREAMING)

30:24.197 --> 30:26.074
Girls, girls! Cut it out.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.039
Turn around. Turn around.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.253
You're a slut.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.760
I'm in love, Luke.
Shut the fuck up.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.095
These girls are for fun, man.
Exotic entertainment, that's it.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.014
Pull yourself together
or I'm gonna tell your dad.

30:49.097 --> 30:53.728
Luke, I'm in love.
Shut your face!

30:55.187 --> 30:56.980
No, son! Wait, wait.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.940
That's very delicate,
give me the scissors.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.903
You gather all the leaves
with the rake and put them there.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.279
Go ahead.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.825
With this?
Yeah, with the rake. Over there.

31:08.493 --> 31:11.870
(TRIMMING BUSH)

31:11.953 --> 31:14.331
Oh, baby! Did you see it?
Yeah.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.584
That's how you play football!

31:16.667 --> 31:20.337
Gotta take it to 'em. Knock the snot
out of them. Every single down.

31:20.421 --> 31:23.173
All the time, every single...!
GAVIN: Alright, dad. Alright.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.925
Dad, I can't work here!

31:25.760 --> 31:29.930
MAN: (ON TV) ...but Davis has
the mobility to get out of trouble

31:30.013 --> 31:32.349
and keep these games packed

31:32.433 --> 31:34.935
in third down session.
Now would you want...?

31:35.018 --> 31:37.438
Let me show you something. See.

31:37.522 --> 31:39.649
Get down in your four point stance,

31:39.732 --> 31:41.442
put the weight on
the balls of your feet,

31:41.526 --> 31:43.861
and drive upwards!
Okay, Dad!

31:43.944 --> 31:46.988
Oh, quit your crying?
See what happens?

31:49.950 --> 31:52.285
Gotta listen to your old man,
or you'll never make it to the pros.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.830
Alright, Dad.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.207
Give me that, man.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.627
Dude, Gav, you should think about
giving me the butcher.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.962
No.
Okay.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.424
You know, I gave him that
when he was ten years old.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.805
Tired of illegal immigrants
stealing your jobs and healthcare?

32:10.888 --> 32:13.641
Every day, thousands of
illegal immigrants

32:13.724 --> 32:16.602
cross Arizona's border into our lands.

32:16.686 --> 32:18.771
The damage they do is immeasurable.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.566
But now, you too
can help stop them.

32:21.649 --> 32:24.610
Regular people like you
can help protect America.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.654
Hey, show some respect!

32:27.780 --> 32:30.658
Join the Clayton Brothers Brigade!

32:31.784 --> 32:33.578
Sit down, now!

32:38.290 --> 32:40.959
I think you'd make
a good border patrol agent, Mr. Hayes.

32:41.711 --> 32:44.087
Are you mocking me, boy?
No, sir.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.213
But I would like to point out

32:45.297 --> 32:47.257
that you have an uncomfortable amount
of guns in your home.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.678
Are you going to join?
No.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.472
You have to be 21.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.306
Do you know how to shoot?

32:54.891 --> 32:57.560
Yes, sir. My father taught me
when I was six.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.562
Let me show you something.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.692
I'm not afraid to join.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.026
GAVIN: Come on, Dad.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.986
Hell, I'll join
those Clayton Brothers today.

33:08.863 --> 33:10.363
Dad!
Dad!

33:10.447 --> 33:11.866
(LAUGHS)
Come on!

33:11.949 --> 33:14.117
Look at your face.

33:14.201 --> 33:18.288
I swear my own daughter's got
more balls than you do.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.672
WOMAN: Defending the Alamo
in essence meant defending Texas.

33:27.464 --> 33:31.092
Marisol, what's your perspective
about it?

33:31.176 --> 33:34.597
Well, a lot of Mexicans
fought for the Alamo also.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.975
Well, it's correct.
Yeah, well, after the war was over,

33:38.058 --> 33:41.019
they took our guns away and relegated
us out, calling us Indians,

33:41.102 --> 33:42.772
like it was a bad thing.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.941
Well, it was a very complicated time.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.442
Well, as complicated
as it is now, don't you think?

33:48.068 --> 33:50.863
I mean, we are still good enough
to be able to go off to war

33:50.947 --> 33:52.322
and fight for America.
But what about when we want

33:52.405 --> 33:54.575
to live a simple life here?

33:54.659 --> 33:58.370
We get this segregated treatment,
especially here in Arizona.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.541
Okay, Marisol,
we can talk about that later, okay?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.755
What are we going to do?
I'll be right back, man.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.049
Gavin!
Hey, Chris.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.260
Hey, we need to talk.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.596
I don't want to talk right now.

34:15.679 --> 34:19.181
Don't leave. Stay with me.
I'll be back in a sec.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.893
Gavin, well,
help me up there with you!

35:17.240 --> 35:19.117
LUKE: I get it now, bro.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.453
One gets a little tired
of white meat, right?

35:21.536 --> 35:24.539
It's not it, man.
Yeah, okay, you fucking skank.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.168
No, but seriously, dude, this chick
better have a fucking friend

35:28.251 --> 35:30.462
'cause I did not come all this way
to dick around in the park.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.922
She'll have one. I'm telling you.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.468
This fucking gringo again?
GAVIN: See? There she is right here.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.472
Okay.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.515
Hey, Marisol.
Hey.

35:42.599 --> 35:43.809
How are you?

35:43.893 --> 35:45.602
This is Teté and this is Kiko.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.145
Hi, Teté.
Hi.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.731
Hey, Kiko, how's it going? I'm Gavin.
What's up?

35:48.814 --> 35:51.817
This is my buddy, Luke.
Hi, nice to meet you, Teté.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.193
What's up, buddy?
Hi.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.154
Hey, Luke. What's up?
Hey, Marisol, I uh...

35:56.237 --> 35:58.323
I want to show you something, actually.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.533
Okay.
Come with me.

36:01.786 --> 36:03.913
MARISOL: Where are we going?
LUKE: Well fuck.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.455
You want to get some
coffee or something?

36:05.538 --> 36:06.707
Yeah, sure.

36:07.917 --> 36:09.960
Cabrón, she's with me!

36:14.965 --> 36:16.591
LUKE: Where did you say
you were born again?

36:16.676 --> 36:18.803
I was born here,
but my mom's from Venezuela.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.013
Do you know where that is?
Never mind.

36:21.097 --> 36:22.472
It's somewhere down there.

36:22.555 --> 36:23.849
I know you guys have
a couple of ball players.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.851
TETÉ: Try a couple of Miss Universes.

36:25.935 --> 36:27.770
Country of the most beautiful women.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.065
Well, I mean...
That I can tell.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.900
What the fuck?
Sorry!

36:33.776 --> 36:35.778
Sorry!
TETÉ: Kiko!

36:35.861 --> 36:37.362
Where in the world
are you taking me, Gavin?

36:37.445 --> 36:38.698
I'll show you.

36:38.781 --> 36:42.743
So are there any, like,
lethal predators or rattle snakes?

36:42.827 --> 36:45.453
You'll be fine.
Possible...

36:45.537 --> 36:46.956
Just don't tell anybody
about this place, okay?

36:47.039 --> 36:49.207
Cougars that will eat us
out here?

36:49.290 --> 36:50.375
(LAUGHING)

36:50.458 --> 36:51.501
GAVIN: Watch your step.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.796
Or are you just trying to make me
disappear into the mountains

36:53.879 --> 36:55.840
and never be heard of again?

36:55.923 --> 36:58.008
So do all your friends risk death?

36:58.092 --> 37:00.301
No, just you.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.645
Gosh, it's so beautiful.
GAVIN: It's nice, huh?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.945
(GAVIN SIGHS)

37:20.238 --> 37:23.784
It's quiet.
You know, it's away from everything.

37:23.868 --> 37:26.120
It's like a whole different planet
out here.

37:26.203 --> 37:28.080
Nobody is telling you what to do and...

37:28.164 --> 37:31.666
Best part is, here you could...
you could be whatever you want.

37:37.006 --> 37:38.758
Yeah.

37:42.845 --> 37:44.138
What's that?

37:44.221 --> 37:47.099
Over there, on the end.
It's the border.

37:50.019 --> 37:51.686
What?

37:53.354 --> 37:55.273
MARISOL: It's weird, that's all.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.360
It's such a tiny little thing over there
and it means so much...

38:00.237 --> 38:02.823
to way too many people around here.
Yeah.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.577
Well, I'm gonna draw it.
Might as well.

38:08.162 --> 38:10.330
GAVIN: What, are you an artist?
No.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.665
I just draw, artists starve anyways.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.669
How long have you been drawing then?

38:16.753 --> 38:18.630
Um, I guess I can say
since I was little.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.757
My dad used to take me
to work with him.

38:21.424 --> 38:25.345
I drew like a million different
types of gardens and landscapes there.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.472
That's cool.
Is your dad a gardener?

38:27.555 --> 38:29.809
Yeah, he used to be.

38:29.892 --> 38:31.559
But now he's a hot shot,
you know.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.814
He's got like 15 lawnmowers
and two vans.

38:34.897 --> 38:36.941
He is what you call a landscaper.

38:38.067 --> 38:39.609
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.654
GAVIN: Let me see that.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.199
Let me see that.
No. No!

38:46.491 --> 38:49.161
I don't think you'd starve,
are you kidding me?

38:49.245 --> 38:51.371
You weren't supposed to see that.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.581
Let me see.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.295
Alright, let me see.
Don't!

38:59.129 --> 39:01.631
No!
You are an artist.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.342
That's cool.

39:26.115 --> 39:27.699
Shit.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.997
(LAUGHTER)

39:34.331 --> 39:36.125
(GROANS)

39:37.167 --> 39:38.710
No!

39:50.180 --> 39:52.182
Dude, you can't be
walking around like that.

39:52.266 --> 39:53.893
No, it's not that bad.

39:53.976 --> 39:56.477
(SCOFFS)
Yeah, right.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.898
Really, it's not that big.

39:58.981 --> 40:00.398
Dude, we need to find you something.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.525
I'm gonna like rip this more
every time I see it.

40:02.609 --> 40:03.903
It could be worse.

40:05.988 --> 40:07.990
Come on.
What are you doing?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.866
Where are we going?

40:11.368 --> 40:14.454
What? Whoa, whoa... What are you doing?
You know there's people here?

40:14.537 --> 40:17.707
I know that. But, like, this is my dad's
and it will fit you.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.876
And you can't be wearing
that anymore.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.047
I don't know about that.
You can have something from me.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.340
Okay.
Okay?

40:24.422 --> 40:25.925
Fine.
There you go.

40:26.008 --> 40:28.260
Hurry up. There's people staring at us.
I'll get your bag.

40:28.344 --> 40:29.761
Alright!
No!

40:29.844 --> 40:31.429
Come on!

40:35.850 --> 40:38.187
Stop!
Hey!

40:38.270 --> 40:39.812
There you go.

40:41.357 --> 40:42.815
Woops.
Hey.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.860
It's a sin to throw food away,
man, especially popcorn.

40:45.945 --> 40:48.030
Fuck you!
TETÉ: Come on, Kiko.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.447
Don't be rude.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.241
Now I have two traitors.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.079
What are you looking at, asshole?

40:55.162 --> 40:56.829
I don't speak Spanish.

40:56.913 --> 41:00.334
I said, "What are you
looking at, asshole?"

41:00.417 --> 41:01.961
Kiko!
What did you just call me?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.132
Luke!

41:14.390 --> 41:16.100
Come with me, sugar.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.479
Asshole, you're gonna get it.

41:22.356 --> 41:23.856
Damn it, let's go!

41:26.026 --> 41:30.447
Wake up, honey, we're leaving.
Hey! Let's go.

41:31.614 --> 41:34.076
What the fuck are you wearing?

41:34.159 --> 41:36.036
Don't even, man.

41:39.373 --> 41:42.750
You fucked that girl, didn't you?
You dirty little skank!

41:42.834 --> 41:44.544
I didn't, I didn't.
Yeah, you fucking did.

41:44.627 --> 41:45.962
No, I didn't!
How was she, man?

41:46.046 --> 41:47.047
Oh, give it up!

41:47.131 --> 41:48.798
A little bit of hot sauce,
a little bit of Tapatio.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.509
Did you taste that taco?
Fuck you!

41:53.470 --> 41:55.389
Who the fuck is that guy anyways?

41:55.472 --> 41:57.682
I don't know, some Chávez, dude.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.396
Hey, do you want this?

42:03.355 --> 42:04.440
Are you serious?

42:04.522 --> 42:06.774
Yeah. Do you want it or not?
Fuck, yeah, man. Absolutely.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.985
It's the butcher.
Sure you want to give me this?

42:09.069 --> 42:10.653
Yeah. Let's go.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.364
(ENGINE STARTS)

42:22.249 --> 42:24.876
I don't know what you see
in those assholes.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.462
I hate gringos.

42:28.004 --> 42:31.425
Well, too bad because half
of your family is gringo, dude.

42:31.508 --> 42:34.802
Oh, yeah, baby. Gringo, gringo, gringo.
Yeah!

42:34.886 --> 42:37.431
Yes, but I'm not that
kind of gringo. I'm cute.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.267
Have you heard this guy?

42:40.350 --> 42:42.144
Luke, do you want a beer?
Sure.

Respect her, that's all.

She doesn't want to
because she doesn't want to,

49:08.864 --> 49:11.282
or because she's really
dating a gringo?

Is that a yes?

Yes.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.641
You didn't tell me
Gavin as cheating on me.

50:17.724 --> 50:20.769
So what? You were cheating
on him... with me.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.690
We made out once,
and it meant nothing to me.

or was he a total caballero with you?

of 11 million illegal immigrants
that now live in the U.S.?

01:18:33.627 --> 01:18:35.587
I can tell you one thing,

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:39.257
thanks to congressman Warren and the
Republican Party here in Arizona,

01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:42.092

lost his construction business

from Mexico.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.001
He was a law abiding employer

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.338
