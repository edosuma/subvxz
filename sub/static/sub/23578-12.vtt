WEBVTT

00:00.063 --> 00:02.828
All right, quickly finish
shutting up, everybody.

00:03.508 --> 00:05.350
I have an awesome new Miles mission.

00:05.810 --> 00:07.821
We're gonna make him a deadbeat dad.

00:08.412 --> 00:10.349
Hold up, wouldn't he
have to be a dad first?

00:10.350 --> 00:12.134
Dan, you're great at this class.

00:12.159 --> 00:13.126
I am?

00:13.128 --> 00:14.625
So I was looking for dirt on Miles,

00:14.626 --> 00:16.126
and I found an old
photograph of us together

00:16.128 --> 00:18.564
with this girl, Theresa,
that he had a fling with.

00:18.589 --> 00:22.057
Now, if he had gotten her
pregnant without realizing it,

00:22.059 --> 00:24.193
then their child would now be,

00:24.195 --> 00:26.862
oh, about your age.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.259
What're you do... Anthony?

00:32.320 --> 00:33.683
Pass the photo around.

00:34.472 --> 00:35.771
Well, look at it first.

00:35.773 --> 00:37.172
Never mind... Anyway...

00:37.174 --> 00:39.484
One of you is gonna
bring this photo to Miles

00:39.484 --> 00:40.883
and say that that's your mom,

00:40.885 --> 00:42.736
and that you're his kid that he abandoned.

00:43.137 --> 00:45.070
Voila. Deadbeat dad.

00:45.072 --> 00:47.472
And the best part is,
you're gonna tell him this

00:47.474 --> 00:51.209
right before he walks on stage
in Detroit for a TED Talk.

00:51.211 --> 00:53.078
It's gonna totally mess with his head.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.256
It's gonna ruin his presentation.

00:55.816 --> 00:57.382
The only question that remains is,

00:57.382 --> 01:00.116
Which one of you can most convincingly

01:00.118 --> 01:02.516
play the role of Miles' kid?

01:03.121 --> 01:04.500
Let me see what you guys got.

01:06.005 --> 01:08.305
I've missed you ever since I was a...

01:08.307 --> 01:09.774
Too slow. Too slow.

01:09.776 --> 01:12.386
Okay, Heather. You're
face to face with Miles.

01:12.819 --> 01:14.145
What're you gonna do?

01:14.921 --> 01:16.854
Well, hey there, big daddy.

01:16.856 --> 01:18.876
Nope. Mm-mm, wrong tone.

01:19.259 --> 01:22.093
Am I the only one who feels
like making Miles think

01:22.095 --> 01:24.562
he has a kid might be
going a little too far?

01:24.564 --> 01:25.897
Miles is lame.

01:25.899 --> 01:27.832
He deserves everything
that's coming to him.

01:27.834 --> 01:30.268
He's peddling these fake philosophies

01:30.270 --> 01:33.489
to the ignorant masses and he knows better.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.339
Yes. Devin gets it.

01:35.341 --> 01:37.308
This is exactly what
I've been talking about.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.523
Okay, Devin. So...

01:39.211 --> 01:40.897
Tell me how you break the news to him.

01:41.414 --> 01:44.454
Miles, you're my dad, and you suck.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.908
There's our guy, right there.
The Prince of Darkness is back.

01:48.910 --> 01:50.776
I love it. I'm gonna need to confiscate

01:50.778 --> 01:52.123
that knife from you, though, bud.

01:52.123 --> 01:53.389
Uh, I think I've let
things get a little bit

01:53.390 --> 01:54.656
too loose around here.

01:54.658 --> 01:55.890
Go ahead and finish crossing the A

01:55.892 --> 01:57.458
on your anarchy thing, though.

01:58.695 --> 02:00.228
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

02:17.747 --> 02:19.310
Hey, Ralphie.

02:19.783 --> 02:21.449
Hello, ladies.

02:21.451 --> 02:24.986
We need you to sign off on
the Sadie Hawkins Dance theme.

02:24.988 --> 02:27.021
We're doing '80s again, okay?

02:27.023 --> 02:29.257
Leg-warmers and side ponies, y'all.

02:29.726 --> 02:31.426
Well, I don't know if
you guys have noticed,

02:31.428 --> 02:34.262
but since Brenda and I separated,

02:34.264 --> 02:37.098
I have been doing my own thang.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.466
Oh!

02:38.468 --> 02:40.535
That's why we came to you, Durb Daddy.

02:40.537 --> 02:44.338
Thank you, but... but I was
thinking that a good theme

02:44.340 --> 02:47.059
for the dance would be...

02:48.378 --> 02:50.500
The movie "Congo."

02:50.747 --> 02:52.447
Based on the Michael Crichton novel.

02:52.449 --> 02:53.948
It's got everything teens love.

02:53.950 --> 02:55.883
It's got gorillas, it's got lasers,

02:55.885 --> 02:58.773
it's got a character
named Herkermer Homolka.

03:00.905 --> 03:03.270
Oh. I've seen that look.

03:03.727 --> 03:05.523
Got that look from Brenda for ten years.

03:05.572 --> 03:06.631
She...

03:06.773 --> 03:08.139
She hated all my ideas too.

03:08.141 --> 03:10.699
I'm, it's just...

03:11.883 --> 03:13.161
Mary?

03:13.410 --> 03:15.043
Um, it's just, uh,

03:15.045 --> 03:16.878
obscure movies that no one's seen

03:16.880 --> 03:18.513
- don't make great dance themes.
- Mm-mm.

03:18.515 --> 03:20.882
I'm sorry... You guys have never seen this?

03:20.884 --> 03:23.318
Okay, guys, you gotta
watch this, all right?

03:23.320 --> 03:25.287
And... and if you still
don't think it's a good idea

03:25.289 --> 03:27.322
for a dance, then we won't do it.

03:27.324 --> 03:29.373
- Okay, that's... that's fair.
- Okay.

03:39.036 --> 03:40.437
Okay, all right, all right, listen.

03:40.671 --> 03:42.550
Get in there and rattle him.

03:43.226 --> 03:44.742
Rattle him good.

03:47.912 --> 03:48.962
Mr. Leonard?

03:48.964 --> 03:51.097
Uh, if you want a selfie,
we're gonna have to be quick,

03:51.099 --> 03:53.200
'cause I've got an awful lot
of people out there who...

03:53.202 --> 03:56.376
17 years ago you had sex with
my mom, which makes you my dad.

03:59.808 --> 04:01.242
Huh? Her? Oh.

04:02.841 --> 04:04.794
Theresa Cantrell is your mum?

04:05.144 --> 04:06.743
Theresa the teaser, we used to...

04:06.745 --> 04:08.412
I have a lot of complicated feelings,

04:08.414 --> 04:09.864
and I'm sure you do as well.

04:09.948 --> 04:12.436
I gotta say, I feel, uh, pretty neglected.

04:12.951 --> 04:14.430
A little angry.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.219
Sorry about the timing.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.959
I hope it doesn't mess up your speech.

04:22.132 --> 04:23.204
A son.

04:24.601 --> 04:26.478
Oh, my goodness.

04:26.796 --> 04:29.246
My life just keeps
getting better and better.

04:29.799 --> 04:31.431
All right, let's have a look at you then.

04:31.433 --> 04:32.967
Oh, you're a big lad.

04:33.469 --> 04:34.868
Look at those eyes.

04:34.870 --> 04:36.497
Beautiful... They're mine.

04:36.497 --> 04:38.363
And you've got the forehead.
You've... we've... got...

04:38.365 --> 04:41.633
You've got the same
highly expressive forehead.

04:41.635 --> 04:43.629
- Oh, my goodness me.
- You're on.

04:43.654 --> 04:46.229
Yeah, got it, right. I've
gotta go and do the...

04:47.141 --> 04:48.941
And you wait here, and I'll be back.

04:48.943 --> 04:50.449
Uh...

04:55.716 --> 04:58.880
Hello, Detroit! I have a son!

04:59.053 --> 05:01.146
Yeah!

05:04.792 --> 05:06.282
Well,

05:07.227 --> 05:09.428
Miles was unfazed.

05:09.430 --> 05:12.043
It's like the meaner you
are to him, the nicer he is.

05:12.068 --> 05:14.800
What kind of a dork is thrilled to find out

05:14.802 --> 05:17.202
that he's been saddled
with an unwanted child?

05:20.490 --> 05:22.356
Ah, and that's him calling me right now.

05:22.381 --> 05:23.599
- Yeah? <i>
- Jack.</i>

05:23.624 --> 05:24.807
<i>Hello, old mate.</i>

05:24.807 --> 05:26.173
<i>Do you remember Theresa the teaser?</i>

05:26.174 --> 05:28.074
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Well, long story short,</i>

05:28.076 --> 05:31.010
<i>she had a baby, and
now I have a son.</i>

05:31.012 --> 05:33.313
<i>And you'll never guess,
he lives in Toledo,</i>

05:33.315 --> 05:34.300
<i>your hometown,</i>

05:34.300 --> 05:36.841
which is where I am right this minute.

05:37.232 --> 05:39.399
Wait, you're in Toledo? Right now?

05:40.357 --> 05:43.552
So we watched the movie "Congo."

05:43.780 --> 05:45.146
And it was good.

05:45.148 --> 05:47.348
- It was very good.
- Very good.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.981
What was your favorite part?
Don't think, just answer.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.953
Easy, when the gorilla
drinks a martini and burps.

05:52.994 --> 05:54.447
Me too!

05:54.492 --> 05:57.610
And while that is all very... funny?

05:57.635 --> 06:00.936
Um, I'm actually starting
to think, just a little bit,

06:01.145 --> 06:03.579
how would you turn that into a dance theme?

06:03.581 --> 06:04.991
As much as I would love to.

06:04.991 --> 06:08.425
Yeah, Durbin, it's like,
What were you even picturing?

06:08.428 --> 06:10.762
How were you even gonna decorate, Ralph?

06:10.764 --> 06:12.497
Take the jungle foliage sets

06:12.499 --> 06:14.543
from last year's production
of "South Pacific"?

06:15.698 --> 06:17.396
Oh, my... Guys, I'm... I'm seeing this.

06:17.397 --> 06:18.950
- This could work.
- Me too.

06:18.975 --> 06:20.156
I can't believe it.

06:20.181 --> 06:22.332
I think we're all actually
coming around to "Congo."

06:22.333 --> 06:24.099
No!

06:24.101 --> 06:25.596
Uh, stop it, Michelle.

06:26.043 --> 06:27.676
Sorry to hurt your feelings, Durbin,

06:27.677 --> 06:28.976
but "Congo" as the dance theme

06:28.978 --> 06:30.594
is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

06:31.614 --> 06:33.125
It's worse than Fish Week.

06:33.942 --> 06:35.308
Brenda hated Fish Week.

06:35.310 --> 06:38.444
She said it was "unsanitary nonsense."

06:38.446 --> 06:42.270
But, I guess, all my ideas are bad,

06:42.295 --> 06:43.478
aren't they?

06:44.219 --> 06:47.448
You know, you guys, just
do the '80s dance and...

06:47.956 --> 06:49.789
Just do whatever you want.

06:55.530 --> 06:58.164
Guys, this is bad. He
can't know that I live here.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.099
And he can't know that I teach high school.

07:00.101 --> 07:01.367
You can always point out the fact

07:01.369 --> 07:03.069
that you don't teach anything.

07:03.071 --> 07:05.638
What kind of a twisted sicko just shows up

07:05.640 --> 07:07.607
to see his abandoned son?

07:07.609 --> 07:09.083
So pathetic.

07:09.335 --> 07:10.902
Drives all the way here uninvited.

07:10.904 --> 07:13.527
It's like he's so desperate for love.

07:14.289 --> 07:15.708
Yeah, yeah.

07:17.544 --> 07:18.544
You're right.

07:19.212 --> 07:21.145
He's desperate. We can use that.

07:21.466 --> 07:25.340
Okay, so, you need to embrace
your relationship to Miles.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.918
Make him really love you, and then...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.314
Reject him. Hard.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.770
And then we can see if old Miles can float.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.952
Uh, too far, Prince of D.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.621
Why don't we just stick
to the emotional crushing?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.356
I don't know, I feel like the moral compass

07:38.358 --> 07:39.991
is thumbs down on this one.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.136
Yeah, and I feel like I'm pretty
thumbs down on you, Marcus.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.183
Great.

07:43.208 --> 07:46.176
Okay, guys, I need some
ideas for Miles bonding time.

07:46.178 --> 07:48.011
What do you guys like to do
with your parents around here?

07:48.013 --> 07:51.133
You know, the Toledo
Walleye hockey games are fun.

07:51.372 --> 07:53.005
My family has season tickets.

07:53.008 --> 07:54.273
And I'm taking my little brother, Jeffy,

07:54.275 --> 07:55.313
tomorrow night.

07:56.144 --> 07:58.378
My man. Dan, that's perfect.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.941
Okay, so, Devin.

07:59.993 --> 08:02.414
Tomorrow you'll go sightseeing
with Miles after school.

08:02.439 --> 08:05.474
And then, end the evening
at a Walleye hockey game.

08:05.476 --> 08:07.978
Ah, you know how to really
set him up for rejection?

08:09.180 --> 08:10.541
Call him "Dad."

08:11.126 --> 08:13.327
Then it's time for the
pièce de résistance.

08:13.328 --> 08:15.494
Tell him you want nothing to do with him.

08:19.834 --> 08:22.268
Here's to our first Toledo hotdog.

08:22.270 --> 08:23.269
Cheers!

08:25.807 --> 08:27.686
I'm gonna need more of these.

08:28.910 --> 08:32.378
The archduke of Slovenia said,
"Miles, if you'll not take

08:32.380 --> 08:36.198
my daughter, please have
these antique dueling pistols."

08:42.657 --> 08:44.616
Those poachers weren't coming back...

08:44.617 --> 08:45.617
Ow.

08:54.594 --> 08:55.997
Oh, thank you.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.627
Look at us!

08:59.894 --> 09:01.199
Wow.

09:01.482 --> 09:03.181
- That was so good, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

09:03.269 --> 09:05.659
Right, next, onto the game.

09:08.408 --> 09:09.461
Come on.

09:10.176 --> 09:13.967
Let's go, Walleyes.
Let's go, Walleyes.

09:21.585 --> 09:22.952
This is perfect.

09:23.189 --> 09:25.089
Matching father-son hats.

09:25.091 --> 09:27.225
Did you know Miles has a set
of antique dueling pistols?

09:27.227 --> 09:29.060
Don't get sucked into Miles' world, okay?

09:29.062 --> 09:30.428
Stay focused.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.987
Go give him the hats, play the dad card,

09:33.299 --> 09:34.866
break his heart. Go.

09:38.104 --> 09:39.617
Ooh.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.342
Oh, mate, amazing.

09:44.344 --> 09:46.644
A couple of matching fish bubble hats.

09:46.646 --> 09:47.798
Thank you.

09:49.883 --> 09:51.082
Yep.

09:51.084 --> 09:52.983
Oh, one question.

09:54.854 --> 09:56.892
What do I do with these bad boys?

09:57.390 --> 09:58.536
Hey.

09:59.877 --> 10:02.526
Oh, what a couple of willies
in a biscuit, then, eh?

10:04.664 --> 10:06.809
Look, Danny, it's me!

10:09.035 --> 10:11.819
Look at that kid, he's amazing.

10:15.942 --> 10:18.643
Dan, tell Jeffy to stop dancing.

10:18.645 --> 10:20.111
Hey, you tell Jeffy to stop dancing.

10:20.113 --> 10:21.746
Because half these people come to the games

10:21.748 --> 10:23.381
just to see Jeffy dance.

10:25.285 --> 10:27.389
Let's go, Walleyes!

10:31.791 --> 10:34.592
Let's go, Walleyes!

10:34.594 --> 10:36.394
It was truly breathtaking,

10:36.396 --> 10:38.062
but I had no one to share it with.

10:38.064 --> 10:39.505
You climbed Everest?

10:39.766 --> 10:41.564
I've always wanted to do that.

10:41.734 --> 10:43.868
I heard it's covered in frozen corpses.

10:43.870 --> 10:45.125
Well, you can.

10:45.150 --> 10:46.871
Devin, you're... You're a great lad,

10:46.873 --> 10:49.407
and you deserve to see
all the beautiful views

10:49.409 --> 10:52.212
and corpses your... Your
little heart desires.

10:56.749 --> 11:00.101
- Oh, nearly. Nearly.
- _

11:02.755 --> 11:04.355
It kills me to have to do this,

11:04.357 --> 11:06.257
but I've got an early flight
to catch back to Stanford.

11:06.259 --> 11:08.039
Thank you for today. I've had...

11:08.895 --> 11:10.622
an amazing time, and...

11:11.462 --> 11:13.240
I'm never gonna forget today.

11:14.998 --> 11:17.935
Thanks... Dad.

11:20.540 --> 11:21.586
Huh.

11:23.831 --> 11:25.551
Come here, son.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.366
Cheers.

11:32.544 --> 11:35.646
Uh, sorry, guys, can I get
out? Thank you, thank you.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.417
Buh-bye. Cheerio.

11:42.228 --> 11:43.412
Hey, hey!

11:44.130 --> 11:45.597
Why didn't you tell him you hate him?

11:45.599 --> 11:46.731
I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.166
I hesitated and ran out of time.

11:48.168 --> 11:49.601
Can we just get Miles some other way?

11:49.603 --> 11:51.902
No, there is no other way. This is the way.

11:53.603 --> 11:54.672
All right, come on, let's go.

11:54.674 --> 11:56.975
Not yet. I don't wanna wake Jeffy.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.676
I literally have to do everything.

11:58.678 --> 11:59.911
All right, fine, give me Jeffy.

11:59.913 --> 12:01.446
Come on. All right, Jeffy, let's go.

12:01.448 --> 12:03.014
Come on, Jeffy.

12:03.016 --> 12:03.982
Okay.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.326
All right.

12:05.552 --> 12:07.752
I'll figure out how to keep
Miles in Toledo another day.

12:07.754 --> 12:09.354
You figure out how to
grow some balls, all right?

12:09.356 --> 12:10.443
Finish him!

12:10.590 --> 12:12.257
Ah, okay, shh.

12:12.259 --> 12:13.781
It's all right. Come here, Jeffy.

12:21.043 --> 12:23.432
- Hello, Jack-o!
- Miles-o.

12:23.739 --> 12:25.306
Uh, how'd it go with your son?

12:25.308 --> 12:27.441
It must've felt nice to
say sorry for having missed

12:27.443 --> 12:30.110
every significant event in his entire life,

12:30.112 --> 12:33.080
<i>you know, baseball
games, recitals...</i>

12:33.082 --> 12:34.961
Aw, his wobbly first step.

12:36.185 --> 12:38.702
Well, I... I didn't exactly get a chance to

12:39.525 --> 12:40.854
tell him all those things.

12:40.856 --> 12:42.423
Ah, that's a shame.

12:42.425 --> 12:44.592
I would've killed to
hear my absentee father

12:44.594 --> 12:46.393
<i>say sorry to me for
missing all that stuff</i>

12:46.395 --> 12:48.128
<i>in my life, you know, in person.</i>

12:48.128 --> 12:49.380
My two cents?

12:49.731 --> 12:52.003
I think it's worth, uh,
sticking around one more day

12:52.028 --> 12:53.076
to tell him all that.

12:53.101 --> 12:56.736
You know Jack, that is
smarter than a seaman's cleats.

12:56.738 --> 12:58.471
That can't be an actual British expression.

12:58.759 --> 13:00.744
All right, cheerio, me old China.

13:01.376 --> 13:04.544
- Uh-oh.
- D-D-Durbie Fully Loaded.

13:04.944 --> 13:07.111
Let me guess, you guys are here to tell me

13:07.113 --> 13:08.912
that eating salty soup out of a cup

13:08.914 --> 13:10.948
is another one of my bad ideas?

13:10.950 --> 13:12.616
No, Durbs, we're actually here to tell you

13:12.618 --> 13:14.513
that we are totally on board for "Congo."

13:15.020 --> 13:17.801
Like you said before, it's a bad idea.

13:17.826 --> 13:20.126
We were talking about it and
realized we're the only ones

13:20.166 --> 13:21.626
who care about the dance theme.

13:21.651 --> 13:22.627
Yeah.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.260
The kids don't pay
attention to the decorations.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.753
They just see them as
something to hide behind

13:25.778 --> 13:27.110
so they can grab up on a butt.

13:27.135 --> 13:28.935
Mm-hmm, yeah, it makes no difference

13:28.937 --> 13:30.904
whether they're honking on
each other's little [BLEEP]

13:30.906 --> 13:34.474
behind a jungle in the Congo,
or a big '80s Rubik's Cube.

13:34.476 --> 13:35.876
I mean, it's true.

13:35.878 --> 13:38.018
The... these dances
are a full-on dog park.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.184
In every way.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.930
I found two poops last year.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.363
Human.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.685
Ralph, we just wanna support you.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.635
I mean, that means so much
more to us than some theme.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.157
You guys are the best.

13:51.015 --> 13:52.015
Listen.

13:52.645 --> 13:55.179
Keep this under your hats, okay?

13:55.181 --> 13:57.481
We don't want some other
school stealing our theme.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.685
We are literally, um, never

13:59.710 --> 14:01.835
telling anyone about this.

14:02.262 --> 14:04.082
Ever. Okay?

14:17.694 --> 14:19.467
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.844
Is this... is this Biology class?

14:25.566 --> 14:27.832
Ah, hah, there he is.

14:28.142 --> 14:29.642
Miles, what're you doing here?

14:29.644 --> 14:33.279
Well, I... I realized that
I never apologized to you,

14:33.281 --> 14:35.294
for missing out on... Well, I've missed...

14:35.448 --> 14:36.782
Missing out on everything

14:36.784 --> 14:38.017
until yesterday.

14:38.029 --> 14:40.353
And I wanted to swear to you
that I'm gonna make that right.

14:40.408 --> 14:42.407
Money's no object. You
know, whatever it costs.

14:42.432 --> 14:43.799
I'll fly backwards and forwards.

14:43.801 --> 14:47.277
Whatever it takes to... To be your dad.

14:47.504 --> 14:48.782
I can't do this.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.242
- You're not my dad.
- No, I...

14:51.475 --> 14:52.808
Completely understand that.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.442
And I will work to earn that title.

14:54.444 --> 14:56.121
No, I mean it, I'm not your son.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.690
But we... we've got the same...

15:03.404 --> 15:04.686
Expressive forehead.

15:04.688 --> 15:06.288
Well, actually, the forehead's not really

15:06.290 --> 15:07.522
an identifying characteristic.

15:07.524 --> 15:09.054
Okay, shh, bud. Who are you?

15:11.728 --> 15:13.126
I didn't mean any of it.

15:15.645 --> 15:17.165
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

15:17.167 --> 15:18.318
Wha... I don't...

15:18.502 --> 15:21.053
Oh, I was excited about us. I... I felt...

15:21.338 --> 15:23.747
I was gonna have a
fuller life 'cause of you.

15:24.185 --> 15:25.227
And then...

15:45.589 --> 15:46.833
You're a monster.

15:53.302 --> 15:56.269
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

15:56.458 --> 15:59.060
Whoo! Holy crap, uh!

15:59.735 --> 16:01.568
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

16:01.570 --> 16:03.470
that is a garbage can
filled with Miles' puke.

16:03.783 --> 16:04.864
Yeah?

16:04.879 --> 16:06.879
And from what I was seeing,
it's 'cause he's a broken man.

16:06.904 --> 16:08.370
Am I right? Okay.

16:08.558 --> 16:11.004
Well, then this calls for a celebration.

16:11.202 --> 16:13.035
Uh-uh! Whoo!

16:13.037 --> 16:16.873
We did it, baby. Oh, it was glorious, mmm.

16:19.650 --> 16:21.142
What's... what is this?

16:30.641 --> 16:31.641
What?

16:33.313 --> 16:34.578
I'm sorry, what is going on here?

16:34.646 --> 16:36.281
What... What's the deal?

16:36.306 --> 16:39.140
Guys, we... we succeeded. Let's celebrate!

16:39.209 --> 16:40.842
He's a good guy and we broke him.

16:40.910 --> 16:41.937
For what?

16:44.681 --> 16:47.324
For America!

16:47.324 --> 16:48.533
I don't know.

16:49.128 --> 16:50.887
What, are you trying to
guilt me with your silence?

16:50.931 --> 16:52.130
That's not gonna work.

16:52.155 --> 16:53.487
Look, it's not like I don't know

16:53.556 --> 16:54.956
what you guys are
thinking anyway, you know.

16:55.024 --> 16:56.257
Anthony's over there like,

16:56.326 --> 16:57.878
I'm judgy Anthony.

16:57.974 --> 16:59.607
You know? Victor's sitting there like,

16:59.676 --> 17:00.909
I think this may have

17:00.977 --> 17:02.343
gotten out of hand, Mr. Griffin.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.734
I think it has.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.972
And Marcus is like,

17:05.057 --> 17:06.723
At the risk of being

17:06.791 --> 17:08.391
a permanent virgin,
don't you think you should

17:08.460 --> 17:10.665
come clean and tell Miles
it wasn't Devin's fault?

17:11.646 --> 17:12.662
And Sarika's like,

17:12.731 --> 17:13.997
I think I speak on behalf

17:14.066 --> 17:15.665
of all the nerds in the whole wide world

17:15.701 --> 17:17.494
when I say you're a bad guy, Mr. Griffin.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.993
Sarika's right, as usual.

17:19.063 --> 17:21.597
Come on, you guys. All
of you are gonna be fine.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.199
Okay? Look at me, I'm fine. You know?

17:24.268 --> 17:25.934
I feel f... I feel great, actually.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.070
I... I think, um...

17:27.848 --> 17:28.835
I think we did a...

17:28.835 --> 17:31.455
I think we did the world
a... A service today.

17:32.507 --> 17:33.606
Hmm?

17:34.164 --> 17:36.224
So you guys can sit there
and stare at me all you want.

17:36.249 --> 17:38.350
That's not gonna... Not
gonna make me feel guilty,

17:38.375 --> 17:39.827
if that's what you're going
for, that's what I'm saying.

17:39.852 --> 17:40.912
I... I feel good.

17:46.135 --> 17:47.167
I'm gonna go piss.

17:54.959 --> 17:57.544
Hey, Miles, hey.

17:57.613 --> 17:59.909
Whoa-ho, hey. Uh, Jack.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.115
Is that you?

18:02.184 --> 18:04.351
Yes, it's me. Here in Toledo.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.687
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

18:06.869 --> 18:09.255
'Cause I, I was here with
my son... he's not my...

18:09.288 --> 18:10.821
- He's just some...
- I know.

18:10.846 --> 18:12.670
- Guy that pretended...
- I'm gonna explain all that. Look, um...

18:13.290 --> 18:15.524
I never got picked up by another university

18:15.592 --> 18:17.526
after the whole Harvard thing, okay?

18:17.594 --> 18:20.062
I've been living here,
in my dead mom's apartment

18:20.130 --> 18:22.197
and I've been teaching
at this high school, okay?

18:22.653 --> 18:25.663
- I didn't tell you...
- Because... oh,

18:25.663 --> 18:27.125
because you're ashamed.

18:29.258 --> 18:30.941
Yeah, something like that.

18:32.389 --> 18:35.457
Um, look, Devin is one of my students,

18:35.526 --> 18:37.385
and he's a good kid, okay? He didn't...

18:37.816 --> 18:39.239
He didn't set out to hurt you.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.384
I mentioned you a few
times in my class, and I...

18:41.453 --> 18:43.253
Oh, oh, I get it.

18:43.321 --> 18:45.455
You talked about my cushy job at Stanford,

18:45.524 --> 18:48.458
my many awards, my
numerous celebrity lovers,

18:48.527 --> 18:49.926
and Devin became obsessed with me.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.194
Yeah, well, he's not really obsessed...

18:51.263 --> 18:53.430
Devin wanted me to be his dad.

18:53.498 --> 18:54.698
Kind of sweet when you think about it.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.326
Yeah, I wouldn't say he's obsessed...

18:56.368 --> 19:00.239
Jack, you, you, Jack. You have nothing.

19:01.323 --> 19:04.090
But you live here, in the real world,

19:04.159 --> 19:05.525
with all... with real people.

19:05.594 --> 19:07.894
And maybe I need a bit
more of that in my life.

19:07.963 --> 19:10.497
Maybe that's why I believe
his cock-and-balls story

19:10.566 --> 19:12.535
too quickly. Oh, God.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.434
The trials and tribulations

19:14.503 --> 19:17.504
- of fame and fortune, eh?
- Oh, you...

19:17.573 --> 19:20.040
Hey, uh, hello... I've gotta go, mate.

19:20.108 --> 19:21.541
My ride's here. I can't...

19:21.610 --> 19:24.010
I can't leave Oprah's private jet waiting.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.079
Again.

19:25.113 --> 19:26.880
She was bloody livid last...

19:26.910 --> 19:28.212
Come on, come here.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.184
Beautiful sod.

19:30.446 --> 19:33.087
Jack, you know,

19:34.091 --> 19:36.518
maybe the question

19:37.422 --> 19:39.126
really is the answer.

19:41.126 --> 19:43.214
- I'm sorry, how so?
- Cheerio.

19:44.663 --> 19:46.279
Hello, mate.

19:47.532 --> 19:48.838
Airport, please.

20:04.249 --> 20:05.715
So you're, uh,

20:05.784 --> 20:08.209
back in the good graces
of that phony loser.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.069
Happy now?

20:10.435 --> 20:11.467
Don't care.

20:12.270 --> 20:13.270
Me neither.

20:15.006 --> 20:15.938
Peace.

20:27.171 --> 20:29.886
- Miles.
- Jacky boy, it's me.

20:29.954 --> 20:31.087
Fancy this.

20:31.155 --> 20:33.723
You have inspired me yet again.

20:33.791 --> 20:36.392
That's great, Miles. Have fun now.

20:36.461 --> 20:38.060
<i>W-well, hang on, hang on. Hang on.</i>

20:38.129 --> 20:39.332
I'm leaving Stanford.

20:39.831 --> 20:42.815
And I'd like you to take over for me.

20:43.801 --> 20:46.636
<i>I mean, with my recommendation
you would be a shoo-in.</i>

20:46.704 --> 20:48.919
So, what do you reckon, mate?

20:49.507 --> 20:51.974
Fancy being the head of
Philosophy at Stanford?
