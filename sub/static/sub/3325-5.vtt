WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.954
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.504 --> 00:05.210
What do you want?
You gonna kill me?

00:05.423 --> 00:07.414
I was gonna see if you were okay.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.878
This isn't the talk
we were gonna have, is it?

00:10.052 --> 00:11.258
I know you're afraid of him.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.512
Someone once taught me
a very smart way to eliminate lhreal.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.385
Gel someone else to do it for you.

00:16.559 --> 00:17.469
Derek.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.601
They killed the girl that saved me.
And I'm gonna kill them, too.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.739
Back to your seal.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.199
Stop thinking about it, man.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.782
What, you're not thinking about it, too?

00:43.503 --> 00:45.334
We'll both stop thinking about it.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.662
I can't.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.669
Well, there's nothing you can
do about it either.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.512
You sure about that?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.345
Everything okay?

01:00.561 --> 01:01.767
Yeah.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.015
Why?

01:04.232 --> 01:07.565
You checked your phone three
times in the last five minutes.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.608
Waiting for a message.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.276
Anything important?

01:11.489 --> 01:12.604
No.

01:15.618 --> 01:16.949
Nothing.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.383
Yo, Scotty.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.517
Hey, yo, Scotty?

01:43.729 --> 01:44.809
Still with me?

01:45.022 --> 01:47.013
Yeah, sorry. What's the word?

01:47.233 --> 01:48.393
"Anachronism."

01:49.235 --> 01:51.647
Something that exists
out of its normal time.

01:51.862 --> 01:55.195
Nice. Okay, next word, "incongruous."

01:56.242 --> 01:58.574
- Can you use it in a sentence?
- Yes. Yes, I can.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.027
It's completely incongruous
that we're sitting on a bus right now

02:01.247 --> 02:03.033
on our way to some stupid
cross-country meet

02:03.249 --> 02:04.705
after what just happened, incongruous.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.033
Out of place, ridiculous, absurd.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.744
Perfect. Okay, next word.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.829
Um, Darach.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.210
Darach, it's a noun.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.839
We have to talk about it sometime, okay?

02:17.054 --> 02:19.511
And we're gonna be stuck in this thing
for, like, five hours, so why not?

02:23.269 --> 02:24.554
Next word...

02:24.770 --> 02:25.930
"Intransigent."

02:27.064 --> 02:29.180
Stubborn, obstinate.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.021
Oh, buddy, you okay?

02:34.530 --> 02:37.192
We shouldn't have come.
I knew it. We shouldn't have come.

02:37.408 --> 02:40.024
We had to.
There's safety in numbers.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.030
Yeah, well, there's also
death in numbers, okay?

02:42.246 --> 02:44.202
It's called a massacre

02:44.749 --> 02:47.081
or bloodbath, carnage,

02:47.293 --> 02:51.286
slaughter, butchery, wow, that's...

02:51.797 --> 02:53.048
All right, Scott, I'm telling Coach that...

02:53.257 --> 02:55.248
No. No, no, no.
I'm all right.

02:55.468 --> 02:56.799
Well, you don't look all right.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.672
Would you just let me see it?

02:59.013 --> 02:59.968
I'm okay.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.717
Just let me see it, okay?

03:02.391 --> 03:03.847
Okay.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.061
Oh, dude...

03:10.232 --> 03:13.019
I know it's bad,
but it's because they're from an Alpha.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.816
It'll take longer to heal.

03:15.655 --> 03:17.566
How come Boyd and Isaac are fine then?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.952
I can't believe he's dead.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.081
I can't believe Derek's dead.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.126
Am I getting too close?
I'm getting way too close, aren't I?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.676
That depends.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.048
Are you just following the bus,

04:24.265 --> 04:27.632
or are you planning on
mounting it at some point?

04:28.269 --> 04:29.679
Yeah, I should back off.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.396
Well, that also depends.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.439
Do you mean the bus or the ex-boyfriend
you're currently stalking?

04:36.235 --> 04:39.147
Well, after it happened,
I'm not letting him out of my sight.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.436
Hmm.

04:41.407 --> 04:45.241
And by the way, this all started
when he came knocking at my door.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.527
For what?

04:53.669 --> 04:54.829
I found it outside of the school,

04:55.004 --> 04:57.086
right where Isaac got
Boyd and Cora to turn back.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.087
How do you know
it's not from the archery team?

04:59.884 --> 05:01.374
We don't have an archery team.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.133
Oh.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.051
And even it we did, they probably

05:05.264 --> 05:09.507
wouldn't be using military grade
armor-piercing titanium arrowheads.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.425
I looked it up.

05:12.021 --> 05:13.306
Maybe it's one of my father's.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.103
I thought you guys had
some kind of agreement

05:15.316 --> 05:17.181
where you both stay out of all this.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.193
Is that why you came here?
To tell me to stay out of this?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.195
No.

05:25.701 --> 05:26.861
Okay.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.197
Well, I can take care of myself.

05:30.623 --> 05:31.578
I know.

05:31.791 --> 05:34.032
But these guys, Allison,

05:34.251 --> 05:36.628
if you didn't notice, they're pretty terrifying.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.000
Plus, they have some serious advantages,
like superhuman strength.

05:40.216 --> 05:42.207
You're pretty strong, and I can handle you.

05:43.469 --> 05:44.584
Me?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.011
You don't think
I'd have a chance against you?

05:48.349 --> 05:49.930
I didn't say that.

05:50.267 --> 05:54.226
Maybe you didn't notice,
but I'm pretty good with a bow and arrow.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.847
Okay, well, what if you didn't have it?
I still have super strength.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.849
I have skills and training.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.442
l have claws.

06:02.488 --> 06:03.648
I'm smarter.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.109
Well, I'm faster.

06:07.493 --> 06:08.858
Prove it.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.149
Okay, I get it. You can let go now.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.996
- I'm sorry, I...
- Don't...

06:56.208 --> 06:57.323
Don't apologize.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.787
You're right.

07:01.881 --> 07:03.621
- l was just trying...
- I got it.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.589
You made your point.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.135
Allison, the twins were just messing with us.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.349
I've seen the others.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.317
I'm not telling you this because I don't think

07:22.484 --> 07:24.770
you couldn't
easily kick my ass if you wanted to.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.979
I'm telling you this
because they scare the hell out of me.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.868
And they should scare you, too.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.170
Going down?

07:48.385 --> 07:49.841
I know where they are.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.297
Same building as the Argents, we know.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.015
Cora and I followed the twins.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.222
- Then they want you to know.
- Or, more likely, they don't care.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.815
What is this?

08:05.945 --> 08:09.108
Isn't it obvious?
The schemers are scheming,

08:09.323 --> 08:12.781
coming up with a "coup de main,"
better known as a pre-emptive strike.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.697
- You're going after them?
- Tomorrow.

08:16.372 --> 08:17.782
And you're gonna help us.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.187
Two of you, back in your seats.

08:51.782 --> 08:55.024
Jared, again, car sick? Every...

08:55.244 --> 08:57.030
How do you even get on the bus?

08:57.871 --> 08:58.997
Look at me.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.571
No, don't look at me. Look at the horizon.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.331
Keep your eyes...
Keep your eyes on the horizon.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.701
McCall, not you, too.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.745
No, Coach, I'm good.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.544
Hey, Scott, you're bleeding again.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.750
And don't tell me that
it's just taking longer to heal, okay?

09:13.971 --> 09:17.213
Because I'm pretty sure that still bleeding
means not healing, like, at all.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.223
He's listening.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.975
Is he gonna do something?

09:23.272 --> 09:24.887
Not in front of this many people.

09:27.026 --> 09:28.982
Okay, well, what about
the two ticking time bombs

09:29.194 --> 09:30.229
sitting right near him?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.404
No, they won't.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.357
Not here.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.951
Okay, well, what if they do?
Are you gonna stop them?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.196
If I have to.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.117
They're one floor above them in
the penthouse, right above Allison.

09:46.295 --> 09:50.038
So kill them first, that's the plan?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.417
They won't even see it coming.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.373
Why is the default plan always murder?

09:53.552 --> 09:56.464
Just once, can someone try
to come up with something

09:56.680 --> 09:58.545
that doesn't involve killing everyone?

09:58.724 --> 10:02.216
You never get tired
of being so blandly moral, do you?

10:02.436 --> 10:04.427
- Not that I disagree with him.
- I do.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.722
- Why do we need this kid?
- This kid helped save your life.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.646
And you know we can'tjust sit back
and wait for them to make the first move.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.022
You can't beat a pack of Alphas.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.820
That's why we're going after Deucalion,

10:16.033 --> 10:17.022
just him.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.200
Cut off the head of the snake
and the body dies.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.412
Only this isn't a snake, it's a Hydra.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.036
And like Scott says, they're all Alphas.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.116
Deucalion's still the leader.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.869
Let's hope so.
Because you know what happened

10:31.048 --> 10:33.039
when Hercules
cut off one of the heads of the Hydra?

10:33.258 --> 10:35.214
Two more grew back in its place.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.675
Somebody's been doing
their summer reading.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.351
So is that whole "not let them
out of your sight" thing

10:46.563 --> 10:49.179
literal or more like a general rule?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.477
- Why?
- You're running on fumes.

10:53.070 --> 10:57.860
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure that bus
holds a lot more gas than this Toyota.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.490
- What if we stop?
- Is it really that big of a deal?

11:00.702 --> 11:03.284
I mean, so we lose them.
We know where they're headed.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.287
You didn't see what happened.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.159
I know who started it.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.833
Is that what Aiden told you?

11:10.087 --> 11:11.042
Aiden?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.455
Whoa! Hold on a second.

11:14.675 --> 11:18.293
Is that why you invited me
on this whole little road trip thing?

11:19.263 --> 11:20.423
Oh, my gosh.

11:20.639 --> 11:24.223
You're keeping an eye on them and me.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.891
So there's nothing going on
between you two?

11:27.104 --> 11:29.015
I'm appalled by the insinuation.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.471
Nothing?

11:31.859 --> 11:32.894
Nothing.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.770
What do you think you're doing?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.230
What do you mean?

11:39.449 --> 11:40.825
I mean your hands.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.191
They're on your waist.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.400
I know.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.450
What am I, a nun?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.991
Put them somewhere useful.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.211
Is that better?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.209
Moderately.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.345
What?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.942
There's a jackknifed tractor
a few miles ahead.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.819
Could miss the meet.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.156
Boyd?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.784
Boyd?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.867
What... What... Scott?
Where are you going?

12:34.046 --> 12:36.037
Boyd. He's gonna do something.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.918
- Okay, what? How do you know?
- Look at his hands.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.674
Come on, Scott, put those away.

12:45.265 --> 12:49.929
I'd have to be blind, deaf and quadriplegic
for you to be an actual threat.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.602
Or maybe you should take a chance.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.102
Your heartbeat's steady.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.025
You might be afraid of me,
but you're controlling it.

12:59.238 --> 13:02.446
Maybe you'd actually rise to the occasion,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.236
become an Alpha by killing one.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.318
I'm not like you.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.908
I don't have to kill people.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.206
Hmm. Not yet.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.160
But situations come about,

13:16.380 --> 13:22.751
situations where you realize the only way
to protect one person is to kill another.

13:23.262 --> 13:26.629
You wanna threaten me?
Is that why you're here?

13:27.057 --> 13:29.173
No. I live here.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.968
- What?
- I live here.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.517
It's a great building.

13:35.732 --> 13:39.691
And the neighbors are surprisingly friendly.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.031
What do you want?

13:46.243 --> 13:50.907
I want to see what you're made of.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.464
Could someone hit the button
for penthouse?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.690
It's just me, your uncle,

15:03.236 --> 15:04.442
Uncle Peter.

15:05.489 --> 15:08.105
Uncle Peter who killed sister Laura.

15:08.784 --> 15:11.275
Mmm. Not my finest hour, no.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.702
But I'm hardly the only
dysfunctional family member.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.745
Did Derek mention that he killed me, too?

15:15.957 --> 15:18.039
Slashed my throat, ear to ear.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.040
So that means I should trust you?

15:22.214 --> 15:24.580
Actually, I'm wondering if I can trust you.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.665
You've known me for 17 years.

15:26.885 --> 15:31.345
I knew you for 11,
leaving the last six unaccounted for.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.844
And I'm not particularly fond
of things unaccounted.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.345
What are you doing here?

15:36.645 --> 15:38.010
Same as you,

15:38.438 --> 15:40.178
wondering where the bodies went.

15:40.649 --> 15:44.187
Wondering if they were carried out,
or maybe if one of them managed to find

15:44.403 --> 15:48.692
enough strength to push themselves
up off the floor and walk out,

15:49.783 --> 15:53.401
leaving the two of us standing here to
answer the all-important question.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.327
Which one?

16:06.425 --> 16:08.381
I don't know what else to do.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.632
Do I keep trying
to get them to listen to me?

16:17.269 --> 16:19.555
Do I tell Derek that he's gonna
get them all killed?

16:20.856 --> 16:24.223
How do you save someone
who doesn't wanna be saved?

16:24.443 --> 16:26.149
How do I stop them?

16:27.737 --> 16:29.477
Don't stop them.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.653
Lead them.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.199
Let go.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.958
You got a plan?

16:44.129 --> 16:46.962
Tell me your brilliant plan,
and I'll let go.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.840
What are you gonna do?
Kill him right here?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.960
And then what?

16:53.388 --> 16:55.128
What are you gonna do after that?

16:56.475 --> 16:58.090
I don't care.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.898
I do.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.392
Whoa, whoa, you're still hurt.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.564
I'm fine.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.275
Give me a chance to figure something out,

17:13.492 --> 17:15.733
something that doesn't have to end
with someone else dying.

17:18.497 --> 17:19.577
Okay.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.043
- Crisis averted?
-MmmMmm.

17:27.255 --> 17:30.042
Okay, good.
'Cause we got another problem.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.757
Ethan keeps checking his phone,
like, every five minutes.

17:32.969 --> 17:33.924
It's like he's waiting for something,

17:34.137 --> 17:35.798
you know, like, a message
or a signal of some kind.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.049
I don't know,
something evil though, I can tell.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.802
I have a very perceptive eye for evil,
but you know that.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.229
- I don't like him sitting with Danny.
- Yeah, neither do I.

17:44.523 --> 17:45.603
I'm gonna see what he's waiting for.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.555
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna ask.

18:52.507 --> 18:53.917
Something wrong?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.091
Actually, I was...

18:58.138 --> 19:00.379
wondering the same thing about you.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.760
Well, that wasn't very subtle.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.196
Ennis?

19:18.867 --> 19:21.028
Okay, so does that mean...

19:21.494 --> 19:22.779
He's not dead.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.199
Not yet.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.370
It's open.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.515
We could use a little help.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.724
Try the hospital.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.435
Open the gate, Alan.

19:57.656 --> 19:58.736
No.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.573
Help us.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.156
Or maybe I just kill her.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.283
Not here, you won't.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.825
I suggest you leave.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.914
Don't make me insist.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.625
Alan, if he dies,
they'll go after the others.

20:21.471 --> 20:25.214
And don't think their little protégé Scott
won't find his way into the middle of it.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.968
They'll kill him.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.975
You know they will.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.397
Alan, please.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.028
Jared, I'm warning you.
I'm an empathetic vomiter.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.031
You throw up,
I'm gonna throw up right back on you.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.034
And it will be profoundly disgusting.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.582
Please don't talk about throwing up.
It's not good.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.788
I might throw up on you
just to make a point, Jared.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.211
It's not good. It's not good.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.131
Now the rest of you, don't think
we're gonna miss this meet because

21:00.343 --> 21:04.177
of a slight traffic jam,
a minor tornado warning, Jared.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.222
We're gonna make this thing.
Nothing is gonna stop us!

21:07.642 --> 21:09.052
Stilinski, put your hand down.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.055
You know, there's, like,
a food exit about a half a mile up.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.852
I don't know if we stop
and then maybe traffic...

21:13.022 --> 21:15.013
- We're not gonna stop.
- Okay, but if we stop...

21:15.191 --> 21:16.146
Stilinski!

21:16.651 --> 21:19.563
Shut it! Seriously!
It's a little bus!

21:19.863 --> 21:21.728
Stop asking me questions!

21:22.490 --> 21:23.741
I hate him.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.027
Did you call Deaton?

21:26.244 --> 21:28.030
I keep getting his voice mail.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.282
That's it. I'm calling Lydia and Allison.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.448
How are they gonna help,
back in Beacon Hills?

21:32.667 --> 21:35.704
They're not.
They've been following us for hours.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.875
Pathetic.

21:42.594 --> 21:43.879
Hey, Stiles.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.049
Yeah, we're just about to walk into a movie,
you know, the popcorn and...

21:47.265 --> 21:49.756
I know you guys are right behind us.
Put me on speaker.

21:49.934 --> 21:50.969
Okay.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.556
Okay, look, Scott's still hurt.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.064
What do you mean still? He's not healing?

21:58.276 --> 22:00.141
No, he's not healing.
I think he's actually getting worse.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.862
The blood's turning, like, a black color.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.356
What's wrong with him?

22:03.573 --> 22:05.780
What's wrong with him? I don't...
Do I have a PhD in chanthropy?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.611
How am I supposed to know that?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.534
- We need to get him off the bus.
- And take him where, a hospital?

22:10.747 --> 22:12.203
If he's dying, yeah.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.458
Stiles, there's a rest area about a mile up.
Tell the coach to pull over.

22:16.628 --> 22:17.868
Yeah, I've been trying.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.042
Well, reason with him.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.712
Reason? Have you met this guy?

22:22.592 --> 22:23.957
Just try something.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.589
Coach, it's five minutes
for a bathroom break, okay?

22:27.806 --> 22:30.297
We've been on this thing
for, like, three hours...

22:31.267 --> 22:33.098
It's 60 miles to the next rest stop...

22:34.103 --> 22:36.014
Being cooped up for hours is not good...

22:36.523 --> 22:38.434
You know, our bladders aren't exactly...

22:38.650 --> 22:40.060
Coach, this is...

22:40.235 --> 22:41.600
Can you...

22:41.778 --> 22:42.813
Please...

22:43.446 --> 22:45.027
Let me talk! I'm...

22:45.698 --> 22:46.983
Every time...

22:49.994 --> 22:52.326
- Get back to your seat, Stilinski!
- Okay!

22:53.331 --> 22:55.538
Jared, keep your eyes on the horizon.

23:04.342 --> 23:05.331
Hey, Jared.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.214
How you doing?

23:18.147 --> 23:19.978
Jared, you suck!

23:20.191 --> 23:24.685
Hey, somebody grab some towels
or a mop or a new bus.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.664
Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell us?

23:39.502 --> 23:40.958
- Sorry.
- Okay.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.831
Just give us a second, okay?

23:44.257 --> 23:45.747
This shouldn't be happening.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.548
I've seen him heal from worse than this.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.500
Okay, what do we do then?
Do we just call an ambulance?

23:49.721 --> 23:51.382
What it... What if it's too late?
What if they can't help?

23:51.556 --> 23:52.887
We gotta do something.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.306
You know, it could be psychological.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.057
What do you mean,
like, psychosomatic?

23:57.353 --> 23:58.559
Somatoformic.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.180
A physical illness from a psychogenic cause.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.896
Yes, it's all in his head.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.352
All in his head?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.403
Because of Derek.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.777
He's not letting himself heal
'cause Derek died.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.483
So what do we do?

24:16.748 --> 24:18.204
Stitch him up.

24:19.792 --> 24:20.998
I'm serious.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.622
Maybe all he needs to do
is just believe it's healing.

24:35.808 --> 24:39.596
Someone please turn
the sign on the front door to "closed."

24:39.771 --> 24:41.181
This could take a while.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.145
He's gonna need another shirt.
Where's his bag?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.777
Um, I'm gonna get it.
I hate needles anyway, so...

24:49.989 --> 24:51.570
Uh, do you know what you're doing?

24:51.783 --> 24:54.115
- Yeah, my father taught me.
- I mean, how fast are you gonna...

24:54.327 --> 24:57.490
- I mean, the bus, like, the bus could leave.
- Okay, just make sure it doesn't leave.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.370
I can help. Come on.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.740
Okay.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.491
Okay, stay with me.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.212
Stay with me, okay? Stay with me.

25:06.756 --> 25:07.711
I'm tired.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.255
Scott, just look at me, okay?

25:09.509 --> 25:10.715
Just keep looking at me.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.221
Come on.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.601
Come on. Come on.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.728
Unbelievable.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.606
One simple little task?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.108
- You can't thread a needle?
- I'm trying.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.821
Well, you want my sympathy?

25:34.367 --> 25:39.111
Because you're just a 17-year-old little girl
and this is all too much for you to handle.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.950
Well, get over it.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.418
- Thread the needle.
- My hands won't stop shaking.

25:46.421 --> 25:49.413
Breathe. Allison, breathe.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.672
Try it again.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.476
Okay.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.354
How do we approach a situation like this?

26:08.401 --> 26:11.017
- Allison!
- Clinically.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.522
And?

26:12.780 --> 26:14.896
And unemotional... And unemotionally.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.651
Then stop crying, and do it.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.224
Stay with me, stay with me.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.848
Let's go. Back on the bus!

26:54.280 --> 26:56.566
Okay. Scott.

27:02.663 --> 27:03.652
Scott?

27:08.252 --> 27:09.207
Scott?

27:29.232 --> 27:30.312
Scott.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.106
Scott?

27:34.654 --> 27:35.860
Scott!

27:37.657 --> 27:39.272
It's my fault.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.695
Scott, look at me.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.573
It's okay.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.622
- Did you do that?
- Yeah.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.626
Nice.

27:59.137 --> 28:00.252
Can you stand?

28:02.849 --> 28:04.510
Okay. Put this on.

28:12.608 --> 28:13.643
Whoa.

28:14.652 --> 28:15.858
Where are you going?

28:16.237 --> 28:20.480
Uh, l was gonna go
get some food to eat.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.156
Oh, cool. I'll come with you.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.404
Nah, dude, it's okay. I can eat alone.

28:24.662 --> 28:25.742
What are you getting?

28:25.913 --> 28:27.244
Uh...

28:28.082 --> 28:29.197
Mexican.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.453
- Dude, I love Mexican...
- Isaac.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.161
I can eat alone, it's okay.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.921
You're not going alone.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.252
Come on.

28:52.982 --> 28:56.349
We're just gonna talk to him,
try to reason with him.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.900
That's it.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.570
What?

29:01.782 --> 29:03.738
Nothing. It's just that...

29:03.951 --> 29:06.203
I'm actually kind of hungry now.

29:07.997 --> 29:09.328
So am I.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.697
Is he okay? Are you okay?

29:12.543 --> 29:14.499
Yeah. Stiles. Where's Stiles?

29:14.712 --> 29:16.043
Trying to stall Coach.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.041
- We still don't have gas.
- I'm not leaving him.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.043
- Then we have to leave the car.
- Sounds good.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.796
What? That wasn't an actual suggestion.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.301
Allison, wait.

29:25.348 --> 29:27.430
Ah. Screw it.

29:38.361 --> 29:39.692
You didn't come alone.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.148
Yeah. This is Isaac.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.313
I'm not talking about Isaac.

29:51.165 --> 29:52.575
You knew I would do this?

29:52.792 --> 29:53.952
Derek, don't.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.124
You can't do this and no one gets hurt.

29:56.379 --> 29:58.040
- If someone else dies...
- Him.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.750
Just him.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.252
Just me?

30:03.469 --> 30:08.054
Now, how's a blind man
find his way into a place like this

30:08.683 --> 30:10.469
all on his own?

30:55.313 --> 30:56.849
- Stiles, what's happening?
- They went after him.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.100
I told him what was happening with you,
and he just went after him.

30:59.275 --> 31:00.310
Who, Boyd?

31:02.862 --> 31:05.274
Isaac, Isaac, Isaac!

31:05.865 --> 31:07.947
- Back off!
- Stop.

31:08.743 --> 31:09.858
Isaac!

31:28.387 --> 31:29.763
An animal clinic?

31:30.181 --> 31:32.342
It's not as ordinary as it looks.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.886
The building's half made
out of Mountain Ash.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.764
I'm not actually sure how to get in.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.350
Well, maybe we could do
what normal people do

31:40.608 --> 31:41.893
and knock on the door.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.652
- They're here.
- Who?

31:47.448 --> 31:48.608
All of them.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.991
How's our patient?

31:57.500 --> 31:58.580
Out cold.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.409
And the prognosis?

32:01.629 --> 32:03.415
Surprisingly optimistic.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.462
He's gonna make it.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.460
Hmm.

32:48.134 --> 32:51.046
I think you might've
overestimated his odds.

32:58.602 --> 33:02.015
But how do we know who's in there?
Is it Derek or Ennis or both?

33:11.824 --> 33:14.531
Well, we know one thing,
that wasn't for Derek.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.420
Kill him.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.173
The others can go.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.764
You're beaten.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.429
Do it, Derek.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.440
Take the first step.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.653
Are we serious with this kid?

35:16.991 --> 35:18.276
Look at him.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.236
He's an Alpha?

35:21.036 --> 35:24.153
To what?
A couple of useless teenagers?

35:24.373 --> 35:27.331
Some have more promise than others.

35:28.419 --> 35:30.205
Let him rise to the occasion then.

35:31.005 --> 35:32.370
What'll it be, Derek?

35:32.590 --> 35:35.252
Pack or family?

35:56.614 --> 35:59.151
Your eyes... Cover your eyes!

36:03.954 --> 36:06.161
- Someone needs to help them.
- Not us.

36:06.373 --> 36:08.625
I'm getting the consulting
business back up and running,

36:08.834 --> 36:09.994
and you need to graduate.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.751
That's a normal life.
And it's what we agreed to.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.840
So we just ignore it?

36:19.053 --> 36:20.168
We stay out of it.

36:20.346 --> 36:24.089
There's a pack of Alphas
trying to kill my friends.

36:24.308 --> 36:25.844
How do I stay out of that?

36:26.060 --> 36:30.599
There's a saying for these kind of situations,
the kind you have to navigate carefully.

36:31.774 --> 36:33.480
It's called, "threading the needle."

36:35.110 --> 36:38.227
It's finding a safe path
between two opposing forces.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.195
Sounds like saving your own ass.

36:42.743 --> 36:44.358
They're not your family.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.448
With all the family that I've lost,
I could use a few friends.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.243
Allison.

38:48.619 --> 38:50.951
All right. Let's go over this one more time.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.448
So it's the sacrifices, right?

38:52.623 --> 38:55.911
Everything has to do with them
and someone who thinks he's, like,

38:56.126 --> 38:57.707
a dark druid of some kind.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.911
Or actually is a dark druid.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.336
A Darach.

39:04.384 --> 39:07.171
You know, some ancient cultures

39:08.263 --> 39:12.723
sacrificed people in preparation for battle.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.971
So we got Alpha werewolves
against a dark druid.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.726
Yeah.

39:21.944 --> 39:25.562
You know, if he's really dead,
it's not your fault.

39:27.491 --> 39:28.901
Maybe.

39:34.331 --> 39:36.162
But remember that whole
thing that we talked about

39:36.375 --> 39:39.788
where I wasn't accusing you of being there,

39:40.003 --> 39:42.085
and if you were there, you shouldn't be?

39:46.176 --> 39:47.507
Thanks for not listening.

39:54.643 --> 39:55.883
What?

39:58.230 --> 39:59.811
l was just looking at your eyes.

40:06.655 --> 40:09.271
I don't think you really know
what you've gotten yourself into here.

40:10.450 --> 40:13.408
It's a little late to be playing big brother,
don't you think?
