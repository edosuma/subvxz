WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:09.080
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:10.560 --> 00:13.960
'This time
they're ballin' in Bali.'

00:14.040 --> 00:15.920
Party!

00:17.720 --> 00:20.400
'Eight sexy singles
looking for love.'

00:21.880 --> 00:23.560
Only person I've loved.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.160
I love this girl.
I'm gonna be with her.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.720
'By getting over
the ghosts of their pasts

00:30.800 --> 00:32.200
on the beach of doom.'

00:35.680 --> 00:37.160
Fuck's sake.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.600
(shouting)

00:38.680 --> 00:40.880
He better not get with anyone.
I'd go mad.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.280
'There'll be tantrums...'

00:43.360 --> 00:44.880
I am fucking fuming!

00:46.520 --> 00:49.160
You shagged my fucking good mate
behind my back.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.600
'...trauma...'

00:50.680 --> 00:53.320
(shouting)
Come on, then.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.640
'...and as always,
the Tablet of Terror is on hand

00:56.720 --> 00:59.160
to cause misery...'

00:59.240 --> 01:02.240
I'm sick of being like this
every single time with you.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.640
'...and mischief.'

01:03.720 --> 01:04.920
Bye!

01:05.000 --> 01:08.560
'Love hurts, and it hurts like hell.'

01:08.640 --> 01:10.600
'Three exes have arrived.'

01:12.280 --> 01:14.400
Coo-coo. (laughs)

01:15.920 --> 01:17.440
Bring it on, pencil dick.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.960
I fucking love it!

01:50.880 --> 01:54.320
There's definitely no chemistry
between me and Savannah.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.000
I can't be dealing with this.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.080
I've put a bit of graft in,
not getting much back,

01:59.160 --> 02:00.400
I'm just being honest.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.880
We've known each other about four
days, you could be an absolute cunt.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.560
I couldn't give a shit
about getting with Dean.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.759
I didn't fucking want him anyway.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.520
Crack on with whoever,
it's not gonna bother me...

02:12.600 --> 02:15.280
Fair enough.
I need to be the single pringle.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.440
So, you still love me?
Yeah, whatever.(laughs)

02:23.040 --> 02:27.200
Last night, I put some moves on
Savannah. And I end up kissing her.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.880
But Chloe went fucking off it,

02:29.960 --> 02:33.400
and it definitely put Savannah off
cos she pure shit herself.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.040
Last night, Marty said that
he wanted to respect us more,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.040
but that is not showing me respect,

02:43.120 --> 02:45.880
by necking on with Yasmin
right in front of me face.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.560
Is that her name, Yasmin?
Savannah.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.960
Two Chloes, mate.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.360
Jordan's canny, I'll try and get
to know him a bit better today.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.160
He could be the one
to help me get over Marty.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.880
I really wanna get to know Chloe a
bit more, she's got a wicked crack.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.520
All the boys fancy me, I could get
any of them whenever I want them.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.400
Max is really hot, so I could maybe
see something happening there.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.200
I think Che's got comfortable
being the best looking girl in here.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.840
I only wanna bang her
cos there's no-one else.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.840
I'm gonna fold Che up, put her
in my pocket and move on.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.720
I need a lovely-looking,
fresh bird to come in here

03:32.800 --> 03:34.520
so I can have a bit of flirt with.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.200
'You won't have to wait
much longer, Max,

03:39.280 --> 03:43.440
as the next ex arrives
in T minus two hours.'

03:43.520 --> 03:46.320
'Whose ex is next?'

03:48.440 --> 03:52.280
'The Tablet of Terror's sent Jordan
and Chloe on an egg-painting date.'

03:52.360 --> 03:55.200
'What better way
for them to crack on?'

03:55.280 --> 03:57.280
Me and Jordan are painting eggs.
Eh?

03:57.360 --> 04:00.000
Who the fuck does that?
And how is that fun?

04:00.080 --> 04:01.600
Like...
(thunder rumbles)

04:01.680 --> 04:03.200
What the fuck?
Fucking hell.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.520
That's your snoring, you know.
(laughs)

04:10.320 --> 04:11.920
Your eyes are amazing.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.240
Jordan is proper
putting on the charm.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.279
You've got nice lips.
Do I?

04:16.360 --> 04:19.560
Chloe, I am definitely the guy
to help you get over Marty.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.680
So, you are attracted to me,
yeah?

04:21.760 --> 04:25.760
You're not my usual type, you know.
So, my usual type is skinny.Skinny?

04:25.840 --> 04:27.960
With loads of hair?
'Like Marty, then?,

04:28.040 --> 04:31.440
I'm not used to all them big
muscles, it's very confusing for us.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.840
With Marty, I feel like he's
always had this hold over us,

04:34.920 --> 04:38.240
but I'd never get back with Marty,
I don't wanna be with him.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.840
How do you think me and you get on?
Really well.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.520
So, you are attracted to me, yeah?
Yeah. Or I wouldn't be smiling.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.440
You're blushing.
You attracted to me?Definitely.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.760
We're getting on really well,
so he deserves a bit of a peck.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.680
We should kiss.Clearly, me putting
the charm on thick is working.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.920
This date is going fucking awesome.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.920
Hopefully it's taken her mind off
Marty, cos I do like this chick.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.520
(tablet chimes)
Oh!

05:11.600 --> 05:15.000
Tablet of Terror's out. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:15.080 --> 05:16.880
Who keeps charging the tablet?

05:16.960 --> 05:20.960
"It's time to turn up the heat,
because the new arrival is smoking."

05:21.040 --> 05:23.560
Ooh."Lee, Dean and Max,
head to the beach."

05:23.640 --> 05:26.120
(excited shouting)

05:26.200 --> 05:27.520
Oi, oi.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.240
Put a good word in there, boys.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.600
Get in there, son.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.200
Not so cool now, are we?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.320
(laughter)

05:35.280 --> 05:37.360
Yes, boy. Smoking hot bird.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.760
Oi, expect the unexpected, mate.
That's all I'm saying.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.480
Let's do it, let's do it.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.120
Shit, wait a minute.
It could be one of my exes.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.760
This girl better not be
a bleach blonde.

05:50.840 --> 05:54.520
I like getting all the attention.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.880
We're gonna go listen out
in the bathroom.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.000
I can't wait to hear all the
cringey bullshit they're cooking up.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.640
You got any fit exes?
Yeah, man.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.960
Exactly, yeah.What's the name of
your fucking aftershave, boys?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.400
Eau de Desperation?

06:18.480 --> 06:20.320
If she is a sort,
I'm cracking on.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.720
"If she's a sort, I'm cracking on."

06:22.800 --> 06:24.760
And the same goes for you, Max.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.880
The boys are being
so fucking desperate

06:37.960 --> 06:39.960
at the hint of a smoking hot girl.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.560
A fucking shirt.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.840
He's wearing a fucking...
Getting so fucking desperate.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.640
Just cos we're not fucking slags.
If she's blonde, that's it.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.440
Should we play the game and be nice
to her so that she doesn't?(gasps)

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
Yeah.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.120
I'll be like,
"Well, me and Max had a thing."

07:06.200 --> 07:08.000
(laughs)

07:08.080 --> 07:10.920
I like having all the boys
wrapped around my finger,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.240
so this new girl better not be
stealing my jewellery.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.240
'Oof, should've kept a lock
on that jewellery box, Che,

07:21.320 --> 07:24.840
as your three gold rings have
made their way down to the beach.'

07:26.080 --> 07:28.360
The beach of doom.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.880
One of us are in the shit, the
other two are gonna get fresh meat.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.120
Cheers to fresh meat.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.880
All the geezers are
clucking for fresh meat.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.200
(all) Fair game.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.880
But now we're down on the beach,
my arsehole is flapping.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.520
I feel like it's me.
I think it's gonna be me.

07:44.520 --> 07:48.440
My ex bird could be turning up.
These whities could turn brown.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.400
If my ex comes out,
I'm just gonna bury her in the sand.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.760
Gonna fucking lose me head here,
man.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.320
(echoing) Cheers to fresh meat, lads.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.680
(echoing) My arsehole is flapping.
My ex bird could turn up.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.920
Hey.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.760
How are you?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.160
You pleased to see me, or no?

08:27.240 --> 08:30.280
I'm Georgia from Liverpool
and I'm a sexy glamour model.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.440
I'm like a scouse Barbie doll,
I've got big boobs. (laughs)

08:35.520 --> 08:38.039
I've got extensions, eye lashes done.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.000
Bright blue eyes,
fillers in me lips as well.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.280
I know I'm gonna be
the hottest blonde there.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.480
My ex is Max Morley,
he's like the most genuine,

08:50.560 --> 08:52.520
kindest lad you'd ever meet.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.840
I ended up like kissing his mate
and spending the night with him.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.640
But what's mine is mine.
I think I can still get him back.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.480
100%.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.880
I always win. (laughs)

09:07.120 --> 09:10.040
Seeing Georgia brings a
whole load of emotions up.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.400
She absolutely, royally
fucked me over.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.960
Here to say sorry.
What did you do?

09:15.040 --> 09:18.680
So, me and Max were dating for a bit,
called it off, stopped dating.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.560
And not long after...

09:23.120 --> 09:25.360
...I slept with his friend.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.840
Sorry, if you're gonna
fuck one of my mates,

09:27.920 --> 09:31.000
you're never gonna be
girlfriend material, ever.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.400
We hadn't called it off.
(laughs)

09:34.480 --> 09:36.200
(laughs)

09:36.280 --> 09:38.560
To do what you did,
and I was like, "What?"

09:38.640 --> 09:41.840
You know we called it off.
Still don't shag one of my mates.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.360
I admitted I liked ya.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.560
Don't start.
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.520
He doesn't wanna accept my apology,
then... fuck ya, basically.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.280
I like your bikini, by the way.
It looks very nice.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.680
Deano's obviously gorgeous.
Tall, tanned, muscly.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.880
Thank you, dear.

09:59.960 --> 10:04.040
The blue eyes, the big tits, the
blonde hair, she's fucking fit, man.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.080
From the outset I said,
"Lads, everyone's fair game,

10:10.160 --> 10:12.560
I ain't arsed about my ex,
just crack on."

10:12.640 --> 10:16.320
And I'm thinking, "No, Max, no,
What the fuck have I done?"

10:17.280 --> 10:19.000
(tablet chimes)

10:19.080 --> 10:20.400
Oh, fucking hell.

10:21.720 --> 10:26.840
"Georgia, it's time to
get hot and wet with... Dean."

10:26.920 --> 10:28.000
Lucky bastard.
Ooh.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.720
Anybody but Dean.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.120
Kick me while I'm fucking down.
Jesus.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.600
All right, fellas, see ya later.
Fuck off.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.040
Anybody but Dean.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.480
My head's spinning here.
Spinning, mate.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.040
I honestly didn't think
I was a jealous person,

10:42.120 --> 10:44.720
but I'm an absolute
emotional wreck.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.240
It's kinda thrown you, hasn't it?
Massively mate. Shocked, man.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.600
Shocked.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.920
Oh, hello!

11:02.280 --> 11:04.800
Mine and Jordan's date was pure mint.

11:04.880 --> 11:09.000
I'm not worried about Marty finding
out about me and Jordan kissing.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.800
How was your guys' date?
Yeah, it was really good.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.080
What did you have to do?
Paint eggs.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.400
And did anything else happen
on the date?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.240
(all) Oh!
Hey!

11:18.320 --> 11:20.200
I think yous make a good couple.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.000
Marriage could be on the cards.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.920
Get married, have kids.
Maybes even get a dog or a cat.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.480
I don't give a fuck, really.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.480
Fucking hell,
not about to get down on one knee.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.520
(laughs) It's like he has to
prove that he doesn't care,

11:32.600 --> 11:34.960
and I feel a little bit awkward.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.440
What do you reckon's going on down
that beach, man?Here's someone!

11:46.520 --> 11:48.640
Oh!
Oh, it's the lads!

11:48.720 --> 11:50.920
Is it your ex?
Max's ex, yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Oh, I knew it.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.840
Max looks devastated. What the
fuck's gone on at that beach?

11:55.920 --> 11:58.960
She sat down and she went
"Max, I'm sorry for what I did."

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
What did she do?

12:00.120 --> 12:03.240
I found out she shagged one of
me good mates, it dropped me.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.600
I thought Georgia was just a bang,
she's turned up here

12:06.680 --> 12:10.160
and... it's absolutely blown
my fucking mind, honestly.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.880
Do you wanna get back with her?
I just wanna know what she's saying.

12:13.960 --> 12:18.000
Who's fitter, Che or Georgia?
Georgia's like a fucking ten.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.440
And yeah, she's good.
She's a good girl, man.

12:20.520 --> 12:24.160
Let me guess, maybe she's a ten
because you actually got to shag her

12:24.240 --> 12:25.520
and I didn't fuck you.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.440
And I've shagged her.
(laughter)

12:28.520 --> 12:29.800
Huh.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.520
If she cracks on with Deano
straight away,

12:32.600 --> 12:36.280
without letting me have the chance
to get in there and say what I feel,

12:36.360 --> 12:39.960
then I'll be upset,
do you know what I mean?

12:40.480 --> 12:43.400
'What could you possibly have
to worry about, Max?'

12:43.480 --> 12:44.760
Oh, look, massage oil.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.080
Give her a bit of a massage
with the old oils, beautiful.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.640
Do you like it rough or soft?

12:52.720 --> 12:55.240
Harder.
Oh, you like it harder? Good girl.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.280
He's got the charm,
he's got the chat.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.920
Obviously, I fancy Dean,
he's gorgeous.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.040
Give me a massage, do me foot.
All right, come here. Your foot?

13:04.120 --> 13:06.840
You ain't getting a foot
massage out of me.I am.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.680
Suck me toe. Suck it.
You're confusing me with Max.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.320
I'm fuming Dean didn't suck my toe.
He'll fucking do it.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.760
Lick some of this off me then,
don't be shy.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.920
Now it's my go.
Is it?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.800
Yeah.
No, not there, not there.

13:24.080 --> 13:27.640
Georgia's tits taste like candy
in Willy Wonka's factory.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.840
No.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.400
Her arse is like peaches, a pair.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.040
I'm fucking horny. (laughs)

13:39.920 --> 13:43.120
'Looks like you're not the only one
getting a bit frisky.'

13:43.200 --> 13:45.280
I fucking love girl on girl.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.520
(cheering)

13:47.600 --> 13:49.000
'Ah, cheer up Max.'

13:49.880 --> 13:51.920
Who's next to kiss the Mack Attack?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.040
I am randy.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.400
On to the next one.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.720
Next one?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.360
The idea of Chloe
getting pissed off with me

14:01.440 --> 14:03.680
is stopping me
going anywhere with Marty.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.480
Savannah would like to think
that she's innocent and sweet,

14:08.560 --> 14:12.160
but I am very clever and I can read
her mind. She is very calculated.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.720
Fucking hell, I've seen this before.
This looks familiar.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.040
(laughter)
Go on, go on, go on.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.040
He's trying to act fucking cool,

14:24.120 --> 14:27.760
when he as slagging them all off,
saying they were fucking boring!

14:29.320 --> 14:32.360
Little bit of tongue, as well.
Go on. Go on.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.000
Play a different game now.
It's so boring now.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.360
I've never seen something
so fucking awkward.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.400
I need to pull her aside
and speak to her about this.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.280
Did you see her face?
She obviously still likes him.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.000
Savannah, did you even say anything?

14:52.080 --> 14:53.560
I wanna kiss her loads, me.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.360
Do you think something will happen?
She's shit scared of Chloe, man.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.680
She's not scared of us.
Don't fucking start.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.240
Stop talking about it.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.280
Marty, you are chatting shite.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.880
She was.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.280
She doesn't wanna see anyone else
kiss me, that's what it is.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.120
Every time I go on a date with
someone, you're overreacting.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.200
Fuck me. What do you want us to say,
"I'm fucking devastated for ya?"

15:19.280 --> 15:22.960
I don't care if you get with people
Well, don't talk about it, then!

15:23.040 --> 15:24.400
Fuck off, you divvy!

15:24.480 --> 15:26.600
You're a fucking weirdo, man!
Fuck off!

15:26.680 --> 15:29.040
Shut the fuck up, man,
you little prick!

15:31.120 --> 15:32.840
Fuck off!

15:32.920 --> 15:35.840
Shut your fucking swiggy mouth,
man, you little slag!

15:35.920 --> 15:39.800
I'm the slag?! You've tried to shag
everyone in the fucking villa!

15:39.880 --> 15:42.560
Oh, God, they're arguing again.
Are they arguing?

15:44.600 --> 15:46.080
Fucking muppet, man!

15:46.160 --> 15:49.560
I fucking hate that girl, me,
now, you know.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.720
All turned shit now.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.440
(sighs)

15:54.640 --> 15:56.160
Why is she such a divvy, man?

15:57.440 --> 16:01.640
'Oh, Marty, why don't you turn over
a new mattress and kiss and make up?'

16:02.760 --> 16:06.160
Even though Chloe's me ex-bird,
we've had a lot of shit

16:06.240 --> 16:09.320
and I care about her a lot.
And all I wanna do is apologise.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.200
She's such a lovely girl,

16:11.280 --> 16:14.320
and she is destroyed
because of this arsehole ex.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.960
Marty, I don't wanna argue with ya.
What I did last night was wrong.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.200
I didn't know that.
Well, you know now,

16:20.280 --> 16:23.840
and I said to her you can crack on.
Oi, can I have a cuddle, then?Yes.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
I love ya.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.360
This is the thing
that confuses me and Marty.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.040
One minute, we're at each other's
throat. Next, we wanna be friends.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.520
That was awkward. It's just
so confusing for me ecranium!

16:34.600 --> 16:36.040
'Sorry, what was that?'

16:36.120 --> 16:37.280
...me ecranium!

16:37.360 --> 16:38.560
'Ah, OK.'

16:41.720 --> 16:43.840
(tablet chimes)

16:43.920 --> 16:46.280
Fuck off.
Fucking hell.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.960
Tablet gans off,
and I know for a fine fact

16:49.040 --> 16:51.640
exactly what that's gonna be.
Oh, shit!

16:53.720 --> 16:55.640
He's necking on with her.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.120
Are you taking the fucking piss?

16:58.200 --> 16:59.920
Yeah, but I don't wanna see that.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.880
For fuck's sake, Max's ex
is blonde, blue eyes and big tits,

17:04.960 --> 17:06.960
sounds a little like
somebody I know.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.319
Has she come in here to
purposely wind me up?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.319
Because it's working.
It is seriously working.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.800
I think they'll shag tonight.
Defo.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.520
My mate shagged her first night.
She's come here to apologise to me

17:22.599 --> 17:24.839
and say,
"Sorry I fucked somebody else."

17:24.920 --> 17:28.319
And then she goes on a date with
Dean, she's cracking on with him.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.880
I'm sick of it. I moved on.
Second time.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.960
As if you'd come here that pale.
(laughs)

17:34.040 --> 17:36.960
Max's ex can literally fuck off.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.080
You need to pie that shit off, man.
(thunder rumbles)

17:46.320 --> 17:48.840
Here we go, lads, now.
(groans)

17:48.920 --> 17:52.200
I can see Georgia walking in,
holding hands with Dean.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.600
I'm thinking, "How the fuck
can this girl walk in, smirking,

17:55.680 --> 17:59.040
and tell me she's sorry?"
She ain't got a leg to stand on.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.400
Oi, oi.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.880
Right, yeah, first things first,
right, did yous kiss?Yes.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.640
I'm thinking,
"What the fuck's going on?"

18:11.720 --> 18:13.560
Max is fuming, can't look at me.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.320
We've had a few pictures
sent over, ain't we?

18:19.560 --> 18:23.520
I've only been here for two minutes,
all the girls were snarling me.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.680
If you're a ten, babe,
I'm a fucking 15.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.080
I don't know if you know,
but this is Max.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.880
We've met, Dean, we've met.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.760
I'm not being funny or anything,
babe, but why are you so pale?

18:35.840 --> 18:38.760
Don't you fucking say,
"Why are you so pale?"

18:38.840 --> 18:40.320
Oh, shit.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.280
Who the fuck are you shouting at?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.760
Fucking little slags.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.320
Pop up to me and say,
"Oh, you haven't got a tan."

18:48.400 --> 18:50.720
George...
Georgia, come here, come here.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.920
I'd rather speak to you
than some random bitch.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.520
I don't give a shit
what colour you look.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.480
Max has pulled Georgia to one side,

18:58.560 --> 19:02.120
trying to have a little chat
with her. Fair game? Clearly not.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.120
She is really pale, though.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.840
Georgia's tan is the
shittest I've ever seen.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.280
Just come and sit down here.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.400
Max, let me tell you my side.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.120
You shagged my fucking
good mate behind my back.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.800
You're not letting me speak.
Talk, talk, tell me. Tell me, talk.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.640
What the fuck are you
actually sorry about?

19:30.720 --> 19:33.080
I want answers,
you won't give me answers.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.720
You're not letting me speak, Max!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.520
Is that her shouting?
Yeah, I want to listen.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.320
(laughs)

19:50.080 --> 19:52.800
Show me one little bit of respect...
Let me talk.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.760
Why the fuck, Georgia, have you come
in here saying you're sorry to me

19:56.840 --> 19:59.560
and then cracking on
with another guy? Fuck off.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.200
You shagged my best mate!
I'm being honest!

20:02.280 --> 20:04.240
I did give a fuck about you!

20:04.320 --> 20:07.680
All I can hear is... (whines)
I moved on.Fucked me off!

20:07.760 --> 20:10.520
Like a little fucking
yappy Chihuahua.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.160
He doesn't fucking know!
No-one knows my side.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.760
Honestly, I'm gutted I spent a
fucking £60 steak on you,

20:16.840 --> 20:20.640
cos it were a waste of fucking work.
Ain't had five minutes to settle in.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.760
Everyone's giving her daggers,
screaming and shouting.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.720
It's an absolute liberty.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.120
Listen... What actually happened
from your side, then?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.080
I did like Max.
He thinks I didn't.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.480
He made us feel like
he didn't want me.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.880
A little bit later,
I got with someone.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.560
Everybody, she knew he was my mate!

20:39.640 --> 20:42.760
Fuck me, the girl clearly
just loves winding me up.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.080
I've come in here
to say sorry what I done.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.320
Take his opinion if yous...
You're saying it wasn't my mate?

20:48.400 --> 20:51.280
You saying he wasn't my mate?
I didn't know at the time!

20:51.360 --> 20:52.640
Oh, fuck off!

20:52.720 --> 20:55.040
Who the fuck are you
talking to, mate?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.320
You fucking knew he were my mate.
Oh, yeah!

20:57.400 --> 21:01.520
Oi, listen, come on. Oi, oi, oi,
come on. Everyone's digging her out.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.520
I'm fucking fuming.
Everyone's passing judgement,

21:04.600 --> 21:07.520
no-one wants to know her.
Oi, let me speak, let me speak.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.400
Everyone's standing here,
giving her daggers.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.160
They've all ganged up on her,
giving it big buds.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.560
No-one's even letting me talk.
I ain't having none of this.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.960
Give her a chance to explain.
The first thing she said...

21:20.040 --> 21:22.840
We are.Look at the daggers.
Let them two air it.

21:22.920 --> 21:27.000
Dean's only sticking up for Georgia
cos he wants to stick it in Georgia.

21:27.080 --> 21:31.080
Listen! I've walked in, you're
all fucking shouting at the girl.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.960
Dean's rolling up, thinking he's
the hero. It's so transparent.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.080
Fuck off, we do not need any more
drama in this fucking house.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.160
Yous two should air it.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We've just been over there.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.400
Let them two air it.

21:50.480 --> 21:54.480
I've had enough of this, I'm gonna
lie down and wait for the sun.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.640
Fuck off.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.440
Fuck this, I'm out of here.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.360
You're not letting me speak, Max.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.000
No-one's letting me speak.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.840
Max was spitting feathers
last night.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.880
He's copped a right needle
cos I've got hold of his ex.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.400
Till they tell me they wanna
make a thing of it,

22:16.480 --> 22:19.080
it's still fair game.
Every man for himself.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.840
Last night was like
a fucking car crash.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.440
Georgia coming in
has absolutely floored me.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.840
What's happened's happened.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.600
Me and Georgia at least
need to give things a go.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.640
There's obviously feelings there.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.360
I definitely wanna start to
build bridges with Max

22:41.440 --> 22:43.240
and put my effort into Max first.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.720
Obviously Dean's good looking,
but now I've seen Max again,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.720
just need to see where things go.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.360
Savannah is shit scared of Chloe,
man.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.280
I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be able to cope

22:56.360 --> 22:58.880
with Chloe being a clock block
all the time.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.600
Marty got it all wrong last night.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.200
Savannah's not scared of us,
but I'm finally starting to move on.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.480
I'm still trying to figure out

23:07.560 --> 23:10.040
if Chloe's still got feelings
for Marty.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.720
Hopefully not cos we've kissed,
had a date, been getting on well.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.200
Got a pretty nice bum as well,
to be fair.

23:16.280 --> 23:20.480
Could start to like Marty,
but Chloe has some feelings for him.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.800
It's like a very dangerous game.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.480
I admit it, I don't like the idea
of another girl with blonde hair,

23:31.560 --> 23:33.840
blue eyes and massive tits
in the villa.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.200
So I'll do what I can
to fuck her over.

23:40.800 --> 23:43.120
'With tensions running high
in the villa,

23:43.200 --> 23:46.760
the Tablet of Terror's sent everyone
to resolve their differences

23:46.840 --> 23:50.080
in the best possible way.
Mud fight!'

23:50.160 --> 23:51.840
Cannot fucking wait for this.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.720
There's a few little fuckers in this
villa that I wanna pull all o'er.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.720
Ready?!
(all) Aarrgh!!

23:57.800 --> 24:00.400
Right, here, listen,
I think it would only be fair

24:00.480 --> 24:03.720
if Max and Dean have the first
fight. Winner gets the lady.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.280
(cheering)
Aargh!

24:06.360 --> 24:08.000
I wanna win against Dean

24:08.080 --> 24:11.920
because I think Georgia is actually
quite attracted to big, strong men.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
I need to prove to her
I'm the main guy.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.800
Let the games begin.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.600
(cheering)

24:22.680 --> 24:24.800
I don't know if I want
Dean or Max to win.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.000
Probably Max,
so I'd have to go with Max.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.920
Dean flipped me round
like I was a little bitch.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.840
Fucking hell, boy, you really do
wanna crack on with Georgia.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.120
I'm up next
and I'm going against Che.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.080
It's a battle of the blondes.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.120
Titties, titties, titties, titties.
Oof!

25:03.200 --> 25:04.800
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

25:04.880 --> 25:06.040
Eh?

25:06.120 --> 25:10.000
Since when did Georgia and Che
become friends? It's so fake.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.280
You seem to think that you're
something special, you are not.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.440
You are an absolute loser. Fuck off.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.040
Next up, Chloe and Savannah! Whey!
Hey!

25:25.120 --> 25:27.480
Chloe versus Savannah, ooh!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.840
I am absolutely shitting myself.

25:30.920 --> 25:35.680
I think Chloe's holding a grudge,
and now is her time to take me down.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.440
Seeing me ex bird in the water
wrestling with the bird I fancy,

25:43.520 --> 25:45.280
it's canny sexy.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.600
Go on! Go, girls.
(all) Oh!

25:50.080 --> 25:53.720
I think Chloe's trying to warn
Savannah off me. What you doing?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.760
Go on!

25:56.520 --> 25:59.920
If I wasn't scared of Chloe before,
then I certainly am now.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.240
Right, I've got one.
Big man Jordan...

26:02.320 --> 26:04.840
And little man Marty.
Mouthy man Marty.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.480
This is war, kid!

26:09.880 --> 26:11.920
Marty is all show, no go.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.240
I've got it in the bag.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.040
(cheering)

26:27.440 --> 26:29.560
Who is the king of the villa now,
Marty?

26:30.520 --> 26:32.240
Shut your fucking mouth, kid!

26:33.240 --> 26:35.560
(laughs)

26:35.640 --> 26:37.480
'After getting his arse whooped,

26:37.560 --> 26:41.200
it looks like Max won't be giving up
Georgia without another fight.'

26:41.280 --> 26:44.000
What's the crack with yous two?
Still like her?

26:44.080 --> 26:45.880
Obviously, them two cracked on,

26:45.960 --> 26:49.120
it's a good opportunity to tell Dean
how much I like the girl.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.840
'Or at least a friendly chat.'

26:50.920 --> 26:54.400
I wanna see how it goes.
I think anyone would.Yeah.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.360
But yeah, I did get a bit jealous.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.800
Max is clearly
still interested in Georgia,

26:58.880 --> 27:01.480
but at the end of the day,
it ain't gonna stop me.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.040
We did call fair game,
I think I had a good date.

27:04.120 --> 27:08.000
Better than the date with Savannah.
I do think she likes me. She's fit.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.680
So, I am gonna see where it goes.
Crack on, mate.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.400
There's massive vibes there.

27:12.480 --> 27:17.200
So, Dean's saying he wants to
crack on with Georgia. No chance.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.560
Let's have a good night.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.440
So, let the games begin.
May the best man win.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.440
'Well, good luck with that Deano,

27:28.520 --> 27:31.560
because there's no first prize
on the beach of doom

27:31.640 --> 27:35.160
when an ex washes ashore.'
(evil laugh)

27:36.720 --> 27:39.440
'The Tablet of Terror
has sent Marty and Savannah

27:39.520 --> 27:41.440
on a coffee-tasting date.'

27:41.520 --> 27:42.720
What the fuck is this?

27:44.040 --> 27:45.600
Got any milk for the brew?

27:45.680 --> 27:49.080
This fucking gadgie's just give me
some coffee and, honestly,

27:49.160 --> 27:52.520
I feel like running back to the
villa. I'm off me fucking tits.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.320
It's really nice to have Marty
away from the group

27:56.400 --> 27:59.400
so I can really get to know
his true personality.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.440
So, what did you reckon
to mud wrestling today?

28:02.520 --> 28:05.200
I just thought Chloe took it,
like, a bit too far.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.640
She'd have fucking loved to
take me out.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.040
Savannah seems a bit devastated
about the way Chloe went on

28:11.120 --> 28:14.400
in the mud wrestling. I can't
blame her. Chloe went too far.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.080
She is not over you at all.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.840
Chloe clearly still has
feelings for Marty.

28:18.920 --> 28:21.800
Like, I like you a little bit,
so I'm just gonna like...

28:21.880 --> 28:24.720
If she's gonna keeps on,
I'll just have your back.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.440
I have no idea what she'll be like
when we get back. I am nervous.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.880
I reckon we should
have a kiss here, right.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.360
Only secret kissing, though.
If I've learnt anything today,

28:34.440 --> 28:36.880
I do not wanna piss
that girl off at all.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.240
I actually like the
thrill of danger.I do.

28:39.320 --> 28:42.160
At the end of the day,
me and Marty are both single.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.400
Let's do it.
Danger kisses.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.360
So there's nothing wrong
with a danger kiss.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.320
Next we'll have a danger bang.
Whoa, slow down, Marty.

28:51.400 --> 28:54.400
Danger kiss is all right.
We're not going for the shag.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.560
That's probably
pushing it a bit far.

28:56.640 --> 29:00.040
I'm fucking buzzing. I don't know
if it's the coffee, though.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.040
Cheers to secret kissing.
Cheers.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.040
Definitely enjoyed kissing Marty.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.680
Definitely more than
I enjoyed kissing Dean,

29:06.760 --> 29:08.800
so let's see what happens.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.400
'While Marty dices with danger...
kissing,

29:12.480 --> 29:15.440
back at the villa,
Chloe's not bothered.'

29:15.520 --> 29:17.720
'Not one little bit.'

29:17.800 --> 29:21.760
Just talking about Savannah, is she
really sweet and innocent? Is she?

29:21.840 --> 29:23.880
I'm very confused about Savannah.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.320
One minute, she's pure booting off.
And next, she's pure quiet.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.960
Just don't know the real her.

29:29.040 --> 29:33.320
I think she's trying to be the
centre of attention, ain't she?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.840
I think Savannah is fake as fuck.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.800
Chloe are you... like, truthfully,
cos we're not gonna say nothing,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.920
are you pissed off
about her and Marty?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.640
So, we have more fun playing Scrabble
than going on a date with her.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.240
So, I think he'll miss us while
he's there, so I'm not arsed.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.080
Marty winds us up so much.
I am honestly not bothered

29:53.160 --> 29:56.760
that he went on a date with Savannah.
She's got no crack, no banter.

29:56.840 --> 30:01.600
The only thing Marty wants is a shag.
Let him crack on. Let him crack on.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.720
We're playing a game of
would You Rather?

30:10.800 --> 30:12.600
This is gonna get tasty.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.480
Georgia, would you rather
sleep with Dean...Shock.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.680
...or Max?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.680
This is so fucking awkward.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.800
Max.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.720
Think Georgia's a bit insecure,
but likes to put on a front.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.440
still think she's got
feelings for me.Aww.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.200
She picks Max.
I feel like I've got the power.

30:40.840 --> 30:46.680
Che, would you rather
shag Deano... Shock.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.200
...or Max?

30:48.880 --> 30:51.440
That's pretty fucking awkward.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.960
Obviously I'd shag Max.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
Dean, this is the easiest contest
in the world. I'm winning two-nil.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.960
Let's be honest, you have
kind of dangled the carrot

31:11.040 --> 31:13.400
with a few lads in the villa.
Yeah?

31:13.480 --> 31:15.920
Put your eggs in everyone's basket.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.080
You've spread your eggs about,
ain't ya?Yeah, but...

31:19.160 --> 31:21.280
Would you rather
take the main egg home?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.640
Who's the main egg, Max?

31:22.720 --> 31:25.640
I've took him home
and I didn't shag him, so...

31:25.720 --> 31:28.800
Took the egg home, and you
didn't scramble it. Why not?

31:28.880 --> 31:32.840
That's literally Jordan all over.
"Here's me with my big wooden spoon,

31:32.920 --> 31:35.000
I'm a fucking dickhead."

31:35.080 --> 31:37.400
She just poached it.
It's my egg now, bitch.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.600
Oh!

31:41.680 --> 31:45.400
I coulda had your egg if I
wanted him, before you got here.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.600
Shut the fuck up and fuck off.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.040
Do you really think you're gonna
get back with him? Jog on, girl.

31:52.120 --> 31:56.600
Would you rather spend the night
with me or the night with Che?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.160
This is so fucking awkward.
I love it.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.320
You.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.720
Good.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.200
Get in! This is fucking boss.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.960
Was that an honest answer?
Good answer.Honest answer.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.240
I feel fucking mint, you know.
Thing is, Max, you're the egg,

32:24.320 --> 32:27.560
but I'm the fucking rooster
that laid it.(laughter)

32:27.640 --> 32:29.920
He's nicking
all me fucking birds off me.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.480
I've never had this in me life.
(laughter)

32:32.560 --> 32:37.600
Bitch, please. Could've fucked him
at any point in the day.

32:37.680 --> 32:42.320
Chose not to. And that is why
he's standing me out.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.280
'Well... that wasn't awkward.'

32:58.680 --> 33:01.520
With Jordan, I feel there's
not really a spark there.

33:01.600 --> 33:06.240
He likes the gym, I like chicken
nuggets. It doesn't really equal.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.720
Chloe has dropped a bombshell

33:14.800 --> 33:17.560
that although she's been
necking on with me,

33:17.640 --> 33:20.680
she still likes Marty.
She's not gonna fuck me.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.880
Now, this has been
a real kick in the nuts.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.600
'Jordan won't be the only one
feeling the pain

33:33.680 --> 33:37.920
when the next ex arrives to kick
them all where the sun don't shine.'

33:38.000 --> 33:39.960
(evil laugh)

33:43.240 --> 33:46.640
How do we think the date's going
with, er, Marty and Savannah?

33:46.720 --> 33:50.280
Marty was dreading it. Cos this
pillow right here has more crack.

33:51.680 --> 33:54.920
I think he would've rather
went on a date with a fucking stone.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.800
Fucking speak of the devil, eh?!
Oi, oi.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.200
First question, did yous kiss?
Nah.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.960
We've just been on a very...
Boring!

34:03.040 --> 34:04.520
Boring!

34:05.600 --> 34:07.320
Boring!

34:12.480 --> 34:15.840
I'm literally not sitting here
with you all calling me boring,

34:15.920 --> 34:16.960
I'm not doing it.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.920
Fuck me. Honestly, this
reception's fucking frosty.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.440
Jordan is the biggest fucker
I've ever met.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.800
He can't get attention
off any of the girls

34:24.880 --> 34:27.719
so he's trying to get attention
by stirring the pot.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.120
They was fucking picking on you,
man.

34:33.199 --> 34:37.000
Marty's been really, really nice
to me tonight, he's had my back.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.400
Walk in here after a good date,
and then he's doing that, man.

34:40.480 --> 34:43.600
Went upstairs for a secret kiss,
but she started crying.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.800
I thought
"I'll have to give her a cuddle."

34:46.880 --> 34:50.440
So, do you feel like
we've kinda dug Sav out there?

34:50.520 --> 34:53.199
She's upstairs crying, mate,
you've upset her.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.280
Why are you getting so defensive?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.440
Why not?
Why are you getting jealous?

34:57.520 --> 34:59.840
I've been... I haven't said fuck all!

34:59.920 --> 35:01.840
Jealous? I am not jealous.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.040
I'd be more jealous if this
palm tree necked on with someone

35:05.120 --> 35:06.280
than fucking him.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.480
Why do you want us to be jealous?

35:08.560 --> 35:11.800
One minute, when I'm over you,
saying, "I'm over you,"

35:11.880 --> 35:15.360
then you want us to be jealous.
He wants to keep stringing me along,

35:15.440 --> 35:18.240
but I'm not any more.
Can hear you, but I can't see you.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.080
I can see you with your
fucking shit grandma top on.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.200
From fucking Oxfam.
One ninety-fucking-nine.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.360
Good one, Chlo.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.240
I am not jealous.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.360
Like scrambled egg on your
fucking top, you fucking dick.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.600
You fucking slag.
Fucking idiot.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.760
OK, chuck another one!
There you gan.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.480
Fucking drinks.
Wanna chuck this one as well?

35:40.560 --> 35:42.920
I think Marty is a sly
little fucking snake.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.640
The way he's going on, I feel like
he wants us to be fucking jealous.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.600
Jealousy very much springs to mind.
(blows raspberry)

35:50.680 --> 35:52.000
That's a fucking snake.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.640
I was gonna have a shower, but why
not smell like frutti tutti anyway?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.800
'Speaking of frutti tutti,

36:04.880 --> 36:08.240
Georgia and Max seem to be
taking things to the next level.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.240
Are you buzzing you're here?
Yeah.

36:10.320 --> 36:14.120
Me and Georgia have kissed, we've
made up, I'm absolutely loving it.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.960
I can't stop smiling.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.160
All the boys have put Georgia
at the top of the pedestal.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.880
I'm gonna climb up that mountain
and crack that pedestal.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.040
I tell ya, Marty, I'm not jealous.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.320
There's no reason
for us to be jealous.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.760
I'm not at all.
Yeah, it's fine, it's fine.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.680
Not bothered about him and Savannah.
That's Step one of getting over him.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.200
Don't like how
uncomfortable she feels.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.080
Don't be too gutted about her, I'm
sure you'll get with someone else.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.960
Yeah, man, it's not happening.
I'm off.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.800
You're dying to kiss me.
I'm not, you are.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.960
Me and Chloe still end up
coming towards each other.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.120
You need to listen to me.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.600
Chloe.
What?

37:13.520 --> 37:16.360
I feel like Marty is making
a massive effort with us.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.120
I don't know what's going on.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.160
Me and Chloe are having
a bit of a moment,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.480
and my head's fell off a little bit.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.560
Nah.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.200
Martin. Wait there,
I've got a good way we could neck on

37:31.280 --> 37:33.080
and not get feelings.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.000
Oh, through the window.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.400
That's enough.

37:44.480 --> 37:47.640
I'm always gonna fancy Chloe,
that can't be denied.

38:05.560 --> 38:09.680
'Bad luck, Marty, it looks like
the penthouse is already occupied.'

38:09.760 --> 38:12.520
'While the rest of the villa
calls it a night,

38:12.600 --> 38:15.040
Max's night's just getting started.'

38:17.520 --> 38:19.240
'No, it's not.'
What?

38:19.320 --> 38:20.360
You winding me up?

38:32.520 --> 38:35.560
She fucked some geezer,
yeah, behind my back.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.600
Girl, you are in the wrong.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.280
What... What?!

38:43.360 --> 38:45.120
I think, "I can't stay in here."

38:45.200 --> 38:48.680
I had to take myself out the
situation and go for a tommy tank.
