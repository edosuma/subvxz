WEBVTT

00:13.138 --> 00:15.057
You know,
it really is wonderful that we're making

00:15.140 --> 00:16.517
these sewing kits for the soldiers.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.102
We're giving them the tools they need

00:19.186 --> 00:20.979
to stitch their torn uniforms
back together.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.064
Yes.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.817
Although, of course,
sometimes things can't be mended.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.320
Sometimes a leg needs to be amputated.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.741
Just cut clean off in order to save
the rest of the body.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.286
And then you just move on, you know.
You move on without that leg,

00:36.370 --> 00:38.455
and you pretend you never even had
two legs to begin with.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.793
They're called housewife kits, Emily.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.338
I wish I had
an actual husband to care for.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.924
These housewife kits would feel
much more authentic

00:49.007 --> 00:50.717
if I was really someone's housewife.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.302
You know, personally,

00:52.386 --> 00:55.722
I'm grateful now that
neither of you girls ever left home,

00:55.806 --> 00:57.432
since I've been abandoned by my son

00:57.516 --> 01:00.227
and will likely never even meet
my own grandchild.

01:00.310 --> 01:04.730
I can't believe how Austin is treating us.
I never thought he could be so cruel.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.442
And, honestly, Sue is no help.

01:07.526 --> 01:10.821
She certainly isn't.
Unless she's said something to you, Emily?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.406
No, she isn't speaking to me.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.117
It feels strange to go days
without seeing them.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.871
I know Austin and Sue are right next door,
but they feel much, much further.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.330
Yes, it's awful.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.334
But we just have to accept
that this is our family now, Mom.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.045
We're like the soldier that lost a limb.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.048
We're gonna come out of this stronger.

01:30.841 --> 01:31.842
I hope so.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.343
But I'm really not sure.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.303
Well, I know it.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.182
We can't give up hope.
Hope is all we have.

01:39.183 --> 01:43.103
Even when everything seems so dark,
it isn't crazy to have hope.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.399
Ladies, let's get in the carriage.
We're going to the lunatic asylum.

02:02.915 --> 02:03.916
I beg your pardon?

02:03.999 --> 02:06.376
Yes. Today the Dickinsons are taking

02:06.460 --> 02:09.213
a family trip
to a wonderful new institution

02:09.295 --> 02:12.758
that has tentatively offered me
a prestigious trustee position.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.928
The Northampton Women's Lunatic Asylum.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.638
Those are dreadful places.

02:17.721 --> 02:22.226
As long as we're getting out of the house,
I am so down. I need a change of pace.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.143
See.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.604
Dad, they're gonna make you a trustee?
That's so cool.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.814
Yes. I'm glad you perceive
the opportunity here, Emily.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.816
As I'm sure you've heard me say,

02:29.900 --> 02:33.070
women's mental hygiene is
a cause near and dear to my heart.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.446
I've never heard you say that.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.658
This is the perfect opportunity
for me to cement my legacy.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.619
You know, when I secure this position,

02:40.702 --> 02:42.204
this town will remember

02:42.287 --> 02:45.249
that Dickinson is a name to be said
with respect.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.667
Sounds good to me, Dad.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.668
It is great.

02:47.751 --> 02:52.005
And this trusteeship is as good as mine,
so long as we all make a nice impression.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.093
They like their board members to come from
morally upstanding families,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.221
and the head doctor himself
specifically requested

02:59.304 --> 03:00.889
that you all come along.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.851
So, ladies. To the carriage!

03:03.934 --> 03:05.853
Yes! A "daycation."

03:06.395 --> 03:07.980
I am going to get our bonnets.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.233
Thank you.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.652
Dad, we will get you that trusteeship.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.487
Whatever you need, you can depend on me.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.489
I'll bring the horses round.
Be ready in ten.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.787
Emily, this doesn't smell right.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.415
What do you mean?

03:26.498 --> 03:27.666
Isn't it obvious?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.002
Your father is trying to lock me away
in that asylum.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.461
Mom, what are you talking about?

03:31.545 --> 03:34.298
It's the oldest trick
in the 19th century playbook.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.091
Tired of your wife? Marriage gone stale?

03:36.175 --> 03:38.177
She had too much to drink
on your birthday,

03:38.260 --> 03:40.179
put on her wedding dress
and fell down the stairs?

03:40.262 --> 03:41.889
Just say she's mad and lock her away.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.932
Come on. Dad would never do that.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.310
Your father is very conventional, Emily.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.104
And let's face it,
it wasn't my finest hour.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.231
Mom, you have to come.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.692
Dad will never admit it,
but he needs us now more than ever.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.153
Okay, listen to me.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.198
I promise you
I will not leave that asylum without you.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.824
-You swear?
-Yes.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.451
Now let's go get in the carriage.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.411
Come on! It's a beautiful spring day!

04:04.494 --> 04:06.538
Keep close, Emily. Keep very close.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.874
There you go.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.727
Chin up, ladies. It's the head doctor.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.103
-Everybody, smile.
-Yes, okay.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.814
Edward Dickinson.
What an honor to meet you.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.025
Good day, Doctor. No, the honor is mine.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.194
No, no, no. Truly, I'm a big fan.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.865
Your essay "On the Proper Place of Women"
lives on my bedside table.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.158
You're too kind.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.036
And I see you've brought
the women of your family today.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.248
Yes. This is my wife, Emily.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.625
-And this is my daughter, Emily.
-Hello.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.001
And this is…

04:54.962 --> 04:56.839
-my other daughter.
-Lavinia.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.216
They're very excited for the tour.
Aren't you, girls?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.385
I'm a perfectly sane level of excited.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.054
Doctor, I love the flowers
you've planted out here.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.598
Springtime is so magnificent, isn't it?

05:06.682 --> 05:09.810
Flowers come back like old friends.
We didn't even know we missed them.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.273
I imagine you have your hands full
with this one.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.609
No. Our Emily, she's just unique.

05:17.693 --> 05:18.944
Seems like it.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.821
I just really love flowers.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.700
I like flowers a totally normal amount.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.079
Right. Well, shall we begin the tour?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.873
Yes, this is going to be fun.

05:30.956 --> 05:31.957
Come on.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.919
dear Friend…

05:36.628 --> 05:39.715
war feels to me an oblique place.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.093
"Oblique."

05:46.388 --> 05:48.265
The perfect word.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.393
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

05:51.476 --> 05:54.062
Yes, yes! My brother. Come on in.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.904
How you feeling this morning, brother?

06:02.696 --> 06:06.033
I'm fine. I was just about to start
my lesson with the men,

06:06.116 --> 06:07.618
but then I was summoned in here.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.245
Could we say "invited"
instead of "summoned"?

06:10.329 --> 06:12.039
I like to leave you the optionality.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.832
-Keep it loose.
-Okay.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.959
What's up?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.421
I need your help with something today.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.548
Falls a little outside
the realm of teaching.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.425
Do you have space for that?
Or you at capacity?

06:23.509 --> 06:25.844
Depends what it is, I guess.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.222
Right.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.307
Okay, here's the deal.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.353
The soldiers are going to have
a uniform inspection.

06:34.436 --> 06:38.106
A uniform inspection?
They barely have uniforms to begin with.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.651
I know. It's bullshit, frankly.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.530
But it's part of how we move the needle.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.572
The needle?

06:45.656 --> 06:49.868
Towards getting these men fully recognized
and authorized as Union soldiers.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.622
The more that General Saxton sees

06:53.705 --> 06:56.375
the First South Carolina Volunteers
as a legitimate regiment,

06:56.458 --> 06:58.877
the more pressure he's able to
send up the chain of command.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.170
All the way to Lincoln himself.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.506
One inspection could make
all the difference.

07:02.589 --> 07:06.260
So it's imperative the guys take
this seriously, you understand?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.137
They need to look clean, sharp and ready.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.849
I'll be there to conduct
the inspection this afternoon.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.767
Okay.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.562
Message received.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.940
I'll see what I can do to help.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.024
Hell yes.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.151
This process is working.

07:23.902 --> 07:24.987
I can feel it.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.786
And this is our great hall.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.789
You'll find our girls here receive
state-of-the-art care.

07:35.873 --> 07:39.334
We have a very progressive understanding
of mental sickness,

07:39.418 --> 07:42.546
covering all modern female illnesses,

07:42.629 --> 07:49.553
ranging from exhaustion, overeducation,
menstruation, laziness, being unmarried--

07:49.636 --> 07:51.471
Being unmarried is a mental illness?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.932
No, yeah, that feels right.

07:54.808 --> 07:59.980
To acute mania, chronic mania,
nymphomania, and melancholia.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.191
It's more commonly known as grief.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.902
You know,
Mrs. Dickinson here was recently bereaved

08:04.985 --> 08:06.612
over the death of her sister.

08:08.614 --> 08:12.409
Edward. I was not! You liar!

08:12.492 --> 08:15.954
Me mourning my one and only sister?
Unlikely!

08:16.038 --> 08:18.957
I'm over her. Good riddance to that woman.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.251
Come this way.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.601
Did you hear that?

08:37.683 --> 08:38.684
Hear what, my dear?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.815
Maybe it was just in my head.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.818
Does that happen often,
hearing things in your head?

08:46.902 --> 08:51.114
Yes. Emily has quite the imagination.
She is very gifted that way.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.616
Interesting.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.910
Come along.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.832
There's something off about this place.

09:01.375 --> 09:05.295
Emily, can't you just enjoy
a fun family outing?

09:05.379 --> 09:07.631
I thought you wanted to help
Dad make a good impression.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.842
I do. But I think Dad deserves to know

09:09.925 --> 09:12.094
if there's something suspicious
going on here.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.181
Doctor, what is that door for?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.893
It leads to another room.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.521
Sure. What kind of room?

09:22.604 --> 09:26.859
Just a room designed for
patients who require a bit more privacy.

09:26.942 --> 09:30.153
Yeah, surely you can understand that,
Emily?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.906
Now, she's always had a taste for privacy.

09:33.532 --> 09:34.533
Has she now?

09:37.452 --> 09:41.999
Edward, there's some business
I'd like to discuss with you in private.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.750
Surely, yes.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.085
And the ladies?

09:45.169 --> 09:47.838
Don't worry. We'll have eyes on them.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.631
And there are eyes everywhere.

09:51.383 --> 09:55.804
Just curious, what is your policy
on engraving names in the building?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.893
Wait. Where did Mom go?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.190
This is a nice-looking room.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.066
Can I help you?

10:08.859 --> 10:10.027
My apologies.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.404
-I didn't mean to bother--
-Are you kidding?

10:12.487 --> 10:15.908
Nothing bothers me here.
This is the most relaxed I've ever felt.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.159
Really?

10:17.242 --> 10:19.912
Nowhere in the world does
a woman get treated so well

10:19.995 --> 10:21.830
as at an insane asylum.

10:22.581 --> 10:27.085
The staff here does all the cooking
and the cleaning, plumps my pillows.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.504
It's heaven.

10:29.505 --> 10:33.133
The wallpaper. There are people
in the wallpaper, Doctor!

10:37.679 --> 10:39.932
Great bedside manner, that one.

10:40.766 --> 10:41.767
Wait.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.644
So you're not--

10:43.727 --> 10:44.853
Crazy?

10:44.937 --> 10:47.064
Nope. No more than you.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.317
I'm just here for some much-needed R & R.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.404
So you just rest all day
and no one expects anything from you?

10:54.905 --> 10:55.906
Bingo.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.160
Doctor. Doctor!

11:00.869 --> 11:03.163
There's something funny
about this wallpaper!

11:06.333 --> 11:10.754
Hey! That's my shtick. Get your own.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.470
Go find Mom.
I'm just gonna see what's in here.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.157
Cool.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.745
I mean, if it wasn't totally horrifying.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.601
Mom, I swear, if you are not out here,

12:05.684 --> 12:08.020
I'm gonna report you missing
to the front desk.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.690
Hi. Have you seen a woman who's about--

12:13.358 --> 12:16.695
I'm so sorry.
I will just leave you to your feelings.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.282
It's fine.
I would really love some company.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.950
I'm Florence.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.206
Are you sure? I wouldn't wanna interrupt.

12:27.289 --> 12:31.210
No, I'm always crying.
I was diagnosed with excessive grief.

12:31.293 --> 12:35.255
I simply can't stop weeping.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.468
That sounds cathartic at least.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.429
I lost my lover to the war
just two months ago

12:42.513 --> 12:44.389
and I've been like this ever since.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.770
I know you don't know me,
but trust me when I tell you,

12:49.853 --> 12:53.607
I know exactly what you are going through,
like, 1,000%.

12:54.358 --> 12:57.319
I picture his body lying cold
on the battlefield.

12:58.487 --> 13:01.573
Those arms that used to hold me.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.451
-Those lips that used to kiss me.
-Yes.

13:05.118 --> 13:10.123
And, oh, God, his hair.
He had such great hair.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.085
What was his name?

13:13.669 --> 13:15.796
The sweetest name in the world.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.259
Joseph Lyman.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.636
Joseph was your lover?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.889
I should have married him
when I had the chance.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.308
He proposed to you?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.102
Well, kind of.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.562
What?

13:31.645 --> 13:35.899
Even though I loved Joseph
with all my soul…

13:35.983 --> 13:37.067
Yeah.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.195
…his heart always belonged
to someone else.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.075
Who was it? That bastard.
Abigail? Virginia?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.328
No. It was some nitwit from Amherst.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.497
He just called her Vinnie.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.458
Seriously?

13:55.752 --> 13:56.920
That is so horrible.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.132
I know.

14:00.716 --> 14:03.760
But anyways, he's dead.

14:04.845 --> 14:05.846
Oh, my God.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.473
That's right, he is.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.199
What are you doing?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.035
I'm rearranging my office.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.829
As you may recall,
I'm starting my own law firm.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.874
I didn't realize
you were serious about that.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.210
Yeah. I've already got a name picked out
and everything.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.170
"Panache."

14:38.253 --> 14:40.464
No "Esquire," no "and Son."

14:40.547 --> 14:43.091
Just "Panache."

14:44.343 --> 14:47.262
So yeah,
I'd say I'm pretty serious about it.

14:47.346 --> 14:50.349
Then I assume
you're also serious about divorcing me

14:50.432 --> 14:53.060
and taking custody of our child.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.144
Yep.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.273
Just gotta figure out
some of the paperwork.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.150
I would prefer it if you didn't do that.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.779
I don't want you to leave me, Austin.

15:05.364 --> 15:06.657
Whyever would I stay?

15:07.199 --> 15:10.827
I've been thinking,
we have a nontraditional marriage.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.330
That's an understatement.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.417
So, perhaps we should also be
nontraditional parents.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.002
What do you mean?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.839
I mean, I would like you
to raise this baby with me.

15:23.340 --> 15:27.386
I don't want you to be some cold,
distant father like the one I had.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.555
I'm sorry I've been slow to realize that,

15:29.638 --> 15:34.434
but I hope that you'll believe me now
and give us a chance.

15:40.899 --> 15:41.900
Thank you.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.778
I'd like that.

15:49.283 --> 15:54.580
Well, there is a little boy with no name
who needs a clean cloth diaper.

15:54.663 --> 15:55.664
Get to work.

16:05.757 --> 16:06.925
Dickinson.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.761
As someone interested in a trusteeship,

16:09.845 --> 16:12.139
you surely have respect
for my medical opinion, do you not?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.223
Of course I do, Doctor.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.726
So then you must trust
my professional diagnosis,

16:16.268 --> 16:18.145
which is that your daughter, Emily…

16:19.313 --> 16:20.314
is a lunatic.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.066
She's not a lunatic.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.736
No. She's just a poet.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.530
Oh, dear God, man.
Don't you see what's happening here?

16:29.364 --> 16:31.658
When one member of the family is
mentally ill,

16:32.284 --> 16:34.244
the entire family is affected.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.455
Let her spend a bit of time here.

16:37.039 --> 16:40.250
Undergo some of our…
cutting-edge treatments.

16:40.334 --> 16:41.335
After all,

16:41.919 --> 16:44.463
we run the finest women's insane asylum
on the east coast.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.382
You just need to sign her over to us.

17:11.031 --> 17:14.492
Take one step closer
and I'll jam this into my aorta!

17:15.117 --> 17:16.578
The aorta's in your chest.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.829
Good to know.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.883
Is that Abby?

17:29.967 --> 17:32.845
For the last time,
I did not hide any pills under my tongue.

17:32.928 --> 17:33.804
Abby.

17:34.388 --> 17:35.556
Wait, Emily Dickinson?

17:36.139 --> 17:40.644
My best friend came to visit me?
I'm so touched!

17:40.727 --> 17:42.855
Abby, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

17:42.938 --> 17:46.275
I'm doing amazing! Well, besides the fact
that I can't see at all.

17:46.358 --> 17:49.361
The nurse took away my glasses.
She said I was a danger to myself.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.737
How are you?

17:50.821 --> 17:52.406
How did you end up in this place?

17:52.990 --> 17:54.992
How did any of you end up here?

17:55.075 --> 17:57.119
I went to fight in the war,
and they threw me in here.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.537
They couldn't handle my gender.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.789
My husband, Minister Daniel Bliss,
put me in here.

18:00.873 --> 18:03.417
But it's cool because that's
my new boyfriend.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.211
Why would your husband do that?

18:06.295 --> 18:07.296
He said something about

18:07.379 --> 18:10.883
me participating in some flag burning
at a local suffragette protest.

18:10.966 --> 18:15.053
He was "not happy" with my decisions
and found me "generally annoying."

18:15.554 --> 18:18.307
I'm making air quotes, but you can't tell.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.641
How long have you been here for?

18:20.225 --> 18:21.435
Good question.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.438
They don't let us keep track of the days,

18:24.521 --> 18:26.315
or read, or write,

18:26.398 --> 18:28.567
or give us anything to eat
besides these little pills.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.195
The pills are fun though!
Kinda make the whole thing worth it.

18:31.278 --> 18:35.490
We have to get you out of here.
These conditions are horrific!

18:35.574 --> 18:36.575
Not to mention…

18:38.076 --> 18:39.077
unsanitary.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.247
It's not so bad. I made some friends here!

18:42.331 --> 18:43.999
Hey! Doll girl!

18:45.250 --> 18:46.251
Love that bitch.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.045
I'm gonna break you out of here.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.963
I'm gonna break you all out.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.131
My father deserves to know

18:51.215 --> 18:53.383
what is going on
in the basement of this institution.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.261
This is a flagrant violation
of women's rights.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.679
Okay, now you're talking!

18:57.763 --> 19:00.807
Ladies, listen up. Here's the plan.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.811
Y'all did the homework last night?

19:05.395 --> 19:07.814
Low-key I struggled with mine.
I ain't gonna lie.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.400
Yes, I wrote a sentence.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.987
"This is my wonderful sentence."

19:14.071 --> 19:15.447
Get--

19:15.531 --> 19:17.741
-Damn, Everett, that's good!
-What?

19:17.824 --> 19:18.909
-All right.
-Excellent.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.619
-Students.
-Congratulations.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.038
There will be no lesson today.

19:23.121 --> 19:27.417
Instead, we are having
a uniform inspection.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.129
Wow, Higginson really has audacity.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.048
Man, miss me with the bullshit.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.299
Another inspection is gratuitous.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.468
No, no. Higginson has assured me

19:36.552 --> 19:39.972
that if you pass this inspection,
you might finally receive your weapons.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.099
Yeah, but we won't pass. We never do.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.143
Well, not with that attitude.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.605
No, man,
not with these raggedy-ass uniforms.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.524
Half of which
was taken off of dead bodies.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.484
Or stolen from the plantation house.

19:52.568 --> 19:55.445
I mean, how is this a uniform?
I'm literally wearing a cardigan!

19:55.529 --> 19:56.822
They're setting us up to fail.

19:56.905 --> 20:00.284
Yeah. Then they gonna use our failure
as an excuse to withhold our weapons.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.326
Nah, bro.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.621
Listen. Everybody.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.332
We can't just skip the inspection.

20:07.416 --> 20:11.503
That would be more than enough excuse
for everybody to give up on you guys.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.255
And who knows?

20:13.338 --> 20:16.466
If you pass, you might receive
your weapons even sooner.

20:16.550 --> 20:19.261
I'm tired of "soon." I want "now."
I wanna get to the future.

20:19.344 --> 20:20.804
In your future, Michael Jordan,

20:20.888 --> 20:24.725
cobblers will make special shoes
in your honor.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.436
Shit, that sound dope.
As long as they better than these.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.687
Anything is better than those.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.480
-Goddamn.
-Shit!

20:31.148 --> 20:32.149
Listen.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.863
You guys are gonna pass
this inspection, okay?

20:39.198 --> 20:41.533
Because I am going to help.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.994
Yeah?
And how exactly are you gonna do that?

20:44.620 --> 20:48.749
Look at this jacket.
It ain't got no damn sleeves.

20:48.832 --> 20:52.127
Well, lucky for you guys,
I have one of these.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.050
What the hell is that?

20:58.133 --> 20:59.843
It's my housewife kit.

20:59.927 --> 21:00.844
Housewife what?

21:01.762 --> 21:05.724
Needle, thimble, all colors of thread.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.102
You don't think
this tasteful suit I'm wearing

21:09.186 --> 21:11.104
keeps itself in one piece, do you?

21:12.981 --> 21:14.358
I mend it every night.

21:14.942 --> 21:19.279
Keep myself looking fresh.

21:22.574 --> 21:26.036
Well, I'll be damned.
My man got some sewing skills.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.579
-Yeah.
-I know a few tricks.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.542
My wife, Betty,
she's the best seamstress in New England.

21:32.042 --> 21:34.628
Guess a little bit of her magic
might have rubbed off on me.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.921
You have a wife?

21:38.131 --> 21:39.675
Well, she was my wife.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.136
Not sure exactly what to call her now.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.806
Is she the one
you're always writing to at night?

21:46.390 --> 21:47.391
Yeah.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.270
My wife and my daughter, Helen.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.274
I write to them,
but I never send the letters.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.693
Yeah, I noticed that. Why that is?

21:58.777 --> 22:01.196
I just think maybe it's better
if they forget me.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.160
'Cause odds are I'll never see them again.

22:07.244 --> 22:10.622
So why keep poking at
a wound that can't ever heal?

22:11.415 --> 22:12.958
Be better for them to move on,

22:13.041 --> 22:15.961
and I'll just keep my memories of them…

22:17.838 --> 22:18.839
to myself.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.593
Damn. That's tragic.

22:24.595 --> 22:28.640
The world tore my family apart.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.644
As it has so many of our families.

22:33.729 --> 22:39.401
And sadly, my sewing skills can't mend
a broken community or a broken heart.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.990
But what I can fix…

22:47.034 --> 22:48.202
is a uniform.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.208
Look at that.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.542
Okay!

22:55.626 --> 22:56.710
Yo.

22:57.336 --> 22:59.004
Yo, these stitches are tight.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.632
Maybe we do have a chance
of beating this inspection.

23:01.715 --> 23:03.550
I believe in us.

23:04.134 --> 23:08.305
Yo, Erasmus, what does your vision say?

23:08.388 --> 23:10.682
It says, "Just do it."

23:10.766 --> 23:11.767
Okay, I'm in.

23:12.643 --> 23:14.811
-Makeover!
-Yeah!

24:14.872 --> 24:15.873
Well…

24:17.624 --> 24:22.254
I have to say,
you all look like a real regiment.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.965
Not just a volunteer army.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.925
Let me ask you something.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.678
Are you boys hungry?

24:30.304 --> 24:31.805
Always. Why?

24:31.889 --> 24:34.057
'Cause y'all ate that up
and left no crumbs.

24:37.978 --> 24:42.107
Steady. Guys, act normal.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.234
Which, yes, for some of you
that means act crazy.

24:47.029 --> 24:49.364
When the nurse comes in
with the pills, we bolt.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.074
Scramble.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.043
Time for medication. Line up.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.256
I said line up.

25:06.340 --> 25:07.341
And…

25:08.509 --> 25:09.510
go!

25:12.930 --> 25:14.765
a little Madness in the Spring

25:16.725 --> 25:19.144
is wholesome even for the King.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.564
But God be with the Clown -

25:24.107 --> 25:26.360
who ponders this tremendous scene -

25:28.278 --> 25:30.489
This whole Experiment of Green -

25:31.198 --> 25:33.325
as if it were his own!

25:34.576 --> 25:37.538
Do we have to leave?
I am having such a good time.

25:37.621 --> 25:39.748
Yes, maybe we should stay.

25:39.831 --> 25:42.793
I'd love to get to know
the people in the wallpaper a bit better.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.545
Maybe have some tea.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.129
Yes, thank you for the tour, Doctor.

25:46.213 --> 25:49.049
I do hope that we can formalize
the trusteeship.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.761
With all due respect, I simply don't think
I can offer you a place on the board

25:52.845 --> 25:55.639
when you refuse to accept
my medical appraisal of your daughter.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.849
What's this?

25:56.932 --> 25:58.642
He thinks that Emily needs to stay here.

25:58.725 --> 26:02.020
What? Emily's not the crazy one. I am!

26:02.104 --> 26:04.439
Lock me up. Lock me up for decades!

26:04.523 --> 26:06.149
I'll take the blue room if it's available.

26:06.233 --> 26:09.152
I've seen this all before. Mothers try
to take the place of their daughters.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.988
A noble sacrifice, but I won't allow it.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.991
Emily is the one
who needs to be institutionalized.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.743
Hey, wait.
All this talk about her and where is she?

26:16.827 --> 26:18.036
Where's Emily?

26:20.038 --> 26:21.748
This is a protest!

26:23.208 --> 26:25.586
Shame on you.

26:25.669 --> 26:28.505
You have taken these girls' lives
and you have interrupted them.

26:28.589 --> 26:31.717
Well, I'm crazy too.
Help! I'm practically off my rocker.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.177
Mom, I am trying to lead a protest.

26:33.260 --> 26:35.429
Do you see this? Protesting?

26:35.512 --> 26:37.764
Demanding women's rights?
Civil disobedience?

26:37.848 --> 26:40.851
These are textbook examples
of serious brain damage.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.978
Pardon my sanity in a world insane.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.438
I don't know what's gotten into her.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.648
Dad, you need to know
the truth about this place.

26:46.732 --> 26:48.901
Women are being kept here
against their will.

26:49.568 --> 26:52.863
They are misdiagnosed, abused,
manipulated, over-medicated--

26:52.946 --> 26:53.947
I like the pills.

26:54.031 --> 26:55.657
-Okay, Abby. I got it from here.
-I know.

26:55.741 --> 26:58.535
Dad, this is not
a progressive institution.

26:58.619 --> 27:01.121
In fact, I doubt places like this
will survive in the future.

27:01.205 --> 27:04.333
They are a crime against humanity.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.752
They will be looked back on as relics.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.795
Edward, you want to help your daughter,
do you not?

27:08.879 --> 27:09.755
Of course I do.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.548
Then you should leave Emily here with me.

27:11.632 --> 27:13.342
Likely for the rest of her life.

27:13.425 --> 27:15.594
Just say the word
and I'll make the arrangements.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.554
-No, I don't--
-Wait, what?

27:17.638 --> 27:19.806
Dad, what is he talking about?

27:19.890 --> 27:21.934
You can't leave me here.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.353
No, Dad. You cou--
You wouldn't do that, right?

27:24.436 --> 27:27.189
If you don't, you cannot be a trustee.

27:33.237 --> 27:35.405
No, I wouldn't.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.785
Doctor, my daughter Emily belongs
at home with me.

27:40.577 --> 27:44.873
And if that means losing your trusteeship,
then so be it.

27:52.965 --> 27:56.218
Wait, so are you guys taking me home, or--

27:59.805 --> 28:01.181
Afternoon, Freddie.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.477
Beautiful day, isn't it? Any mail?

28:06.228 --> 28:08.272
Here you go, Mr. Dickinson.

28:13.902 --> 28:14.903
I'm sorry.

28:14.987 --> 28:16.572
Sorry? What for?

28:23.871 --> 28:25.914
Inspection! Company.

28:37.259 --> 28:38.468
Fix your collar.

28:41.972 --> 28:47.269
Henry, your influence is showing.
These men look like real soldiers.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.524
Gentlemen, you just passed
your first inspection.

28:52.608 --> 28:54.193
I'm so very proud.

28:55.235 --> 28:56.737
I knew they could do it.

28:57.821 --> 28:58.906
And just in time too.

28:59.865 --> 29:00.949
Sir?

29:02.451 --> 29:04.453
A battalion of Confederates
is on the march.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.914
Battle is coming to Beaufort, my friends.

29:07.873 --> 29:09.583
There will be violence, of course.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.169
But, perhaps, if we remain open to it,

29:13.670 --> 29:16.089
we might also engage
in some productive dialogue.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.217
Permission to speak freely, sir?

29:19.009 --> 29:19.927
Granted.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.970
-You say battle coming?
-Yes.

29:22.054 --> 29:24.389
Does this mean
we will be receiving our weapons, sir?

29:25.057 --> 29:27.684
I'm very much hoping
that I can facilitate that.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.770
"Facilitate"? What does that mean?

29:29.853 --> 29:32.272
When do we get our guns, sir?

29:33.023 --> 29:34.983
I don't have an exact timeline.

29:36.026 --> 29:37.069
But…

29:39.154 --> 29:43.116
I am off to send General Saxton
a very strongly worded letter right now,

29:43.200 --> 29:46.286
and then we'll just… wait and see.

29:47.120 --> 29:51.375
Again, I am so proud of you men.
You have been working so hard.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.168
I see you. I recognize you.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.462
I thank you.

29:57.506 --> 29:59.550
Company. Dismissed.

30:03.804 --> 30:06.765
See what we mean? It never changes.

30:06.849 --> 30:08.934
He say he helping us but he not.

30:09.017 --> 30:11.937
We gonna be standing here
looking like fools when the battle come.

30:12.020 --> 30:15.732
What does he expect us to do?
Just line up and die?

30:15.816 --> 30:16.942
Hello!

30:17.776 --> 30:21.822
We at a war with a whole bunch of racists
who suffer from economic anxiety.

30:22.406 --> 30:24.533
I need my weapon.

30:26.952 --> 30:27.828
Reload.

30:34.710 --> 30:35.711
I think I'm scared.

30:36.670 --> 30:37.880
Can we do a group hug?

30:37.963 --> 30:39.798
-Absolutely.
-Come on, man.

30:39.882 --> 30:41.133
Come on, man. We got you.

30:43.677 --> 30:44.720
We in this together.

30:50.934 --> 30:52.519
I'm sorry I listened to him.

30:53.312 --> 30:57.232
It's hopeless, man.
We ain't never gonna be no real soldiers.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.484
There has to be a way.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.780
You guys were right.
We can't wait any longer.

31:04.364 --> 31:05.699
So, what you gonna do?

31:06.950 --> 31:09.578
I'ma call him out on his bullshit.

31:16.585 --> 31:17.586
Thank you.

31:19.296 --> 31:21.590
I'm glad we gave Abby
a ride home from the asylum.

31:21.673 --> 31:24.301
Yeah, to her husband
who put her there in the first place.

31:25.511 --> 31:27.304
Dad, I'm really sorry.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.723
I wanted today to go well.
I never meant to cost you the position.

31:29.806 --> 31:33.143
No. That's fine, that's fine.
It didn't seem suitable, after all.

31:34.311 --> 31:35.729
Thank you for not leaving me there.

31:36.313 --> 31:38.649
Daughter.
No, there's no reason to thank me.

31:38.732 --> 31:39.900
No, I owed you.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.235
For what?

31:41.318 --> 31:44.279
For standing by my side
when others chose not to.

31:45.572 --> 31:48.075
Don't think I haven't noticed
your support, dear girl.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.371
I'm starving, are you starving?

31:52.454 --> 31:54.748
Mother? What's on the menu tonight?

31:56.667 --> 31:57.918
Mom, where are you going?

31:58.001 --> 31:59.753
To bed. Do not disturb me.

32:01.171 --> 32:03.423
For, like, a 20-minute nap, or--

32:03.507 --> 32:05.008
Until the war is over.
