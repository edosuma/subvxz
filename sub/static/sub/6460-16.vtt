Earl, I told you to mop
the entrance.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.873
That floor is dirtier

You watch it, too, Oleg.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.255

00:26.192 --> 00:30.062
Have you noticed since Max
and Caroline have been away,

00:30.064 --> 00:33.132
Han is getting a little big
for his bitches?

00:33.134 --> 00:36.168
Did I say bitches?

00:36.170 --> 00:39.204
'Cause I meant to.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.994
We're coming back

01:01.996 --> 01:03.829
Caroline's about to sign
the movie contract,

I was hitchhiking.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.628
Oh, this is the table
where we first met,

04:22.630 --> 04:24.763
and you thought I was
a cheap hooker.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.533
And you were only half right.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.145
and Max, I found your sock.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.780
It was under my refrigerator.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.415
Oh, that makes sense.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.550
I was trying to fish
an M&M out from under there

04:45.552 --> 04:48.654
with a fishing hook I made
with a fork and my sock.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.322
I was so excited about
getting the M&M

04:50.324 --> 04:52.591
that I abandoned the sock.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.393
Max, you know you don't
have to eat candy

04:54.395 --> 04:56.295
that fell on the floor anymore.

04:56.297 --> 04:59.898
I still will, but it's nice
to know I don't have to.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.401
Oh, my God, your whole life
is changing.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.971
We're just waiting
for someone else.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.506
Oh, no, did you invite
a guy for me?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.241
I wish I'd known,

05:09.243 --> 05:11.576
'cause I only shaved
up to the bottom of my dress.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.480
It's not a date for you.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.282
It's someone here

there's four of us,

05:38.205 --> 05:41.406
and out of the four,
Max and I can't touch naked.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.311
Her rule, not mine.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.780
Oh, I'm not here
in a sexual capacity.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.549
I'm Randy's therapist.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.317
And I guess we should
get started.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.119
I do have a 9:00
in the valley.

05:54.121 --> 05:57.489

to her vegan parents

05:57.491 --> 05:59.524

06:02.061 --> 06:05.564
Um, what's happening?

06:05.566 --> 06:08.467
Look, Max...
Elliot?

06:08.469 --> 06:13.505
Look, Max,
my patient, Randy,

06:13.507 --> 06:16.508
is breaking up with you.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.243

What?

06:18.245 --> 06:21.646
Max, I know this sounds abrupt.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.515
Elliot?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.384
Max, in my practice,
I developed

06:25.386 --> 06:27.519
the ripping-the-Band-Aid-off
technique.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.488
You'll read about it
in my book someday,

06:29.490 --> 06:30.856
if I ever finish it,

06:30.858 --> 06:33.825
but that's between
me and my therapist.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.494
He's not speaking to me
right now

06:35.496 --> 06:37.529
because of a couch spill.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.331
And I'd be mad as hell about it

06:39.333 --> 06:42.000
if I didn't completely
understand it!

06:44.370 --> 06:47.739
And now, again,
what's happening?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.409
Because it seems like
you're breaking up with me

06:50.411 --> 06:52.277
using a therapist.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.613
It does seem that way.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.681
Elliot?

06:56.683 --> 06:59.618
He is breaking up with you
using a therapist.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.256
Look, Randy?

07:04.258 --> 07:05.624
Caroline.

07:08.961 --> 07:13.365
Look, Elliot, you tell Randy
to be a grown-up

07:13.367 --> 07:17.269
and break up with her over text.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.439
At least send her
a "Bye, Felicia" bitmoji.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.743
- Let's go.
- Max, don't go like this.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.878
Elliot, don't let Max
go like this.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.613
Max, you're hurt.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.382
You're feeling abandoned.

07:30.384 --> 07:33.418
What would be really helpful
to you right now

07:33.420 --> 07:37.489
is my book, if I can just
get one chapter on paper.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.826
I think people would benefit
a lot from the book.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.160
Well, we're leaving.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.495
This is shocking,

07:43.497 --> 07:44.596
and it's really hard
to shock me

07:44.598 --> 07:45.897
since that time
I saw a mouse

07:45.899 --> 07:48.500
dry-humping a potato
on my couch.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.903
You know what?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.306
You can keep my sock.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.408
On second thought,
I need it.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.676
Max, wait.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.778
I am just gonna go,
because the last time

07:59.780 --> 08:03.181
I was this mad,
someone lost an eyebrow.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.618
And it took me a long time

08:06.620 --> 08:08.553
to grow it back.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.600
Thank you.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.101
Max, hurry!

08:23.103 --> 08:25.303
We have to leave now
to take Sophie to the healer

08:25.305 --> 08:27.539
and still be
at the airport by noon.

08:27.541 --> 08:31.109
I brushed your hair
when you were passed out.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.778
I can't move any faster.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.947
I think this escalator's broken.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.119
I tried to stop you
from drinking bottle number 32,

08:41.121 --> 08:44.189
which was sriracha.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.692
But you tied me to that chair
so well.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.028
Well, since drinking
that hot sauce,

08:50.030 --> 08:53.398
I've been tied
to a different chair.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.134
I have something
to make you feel better.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.536
I doubt it.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.538
Unless it's a diaper
full of ice.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.576
It's not that.
I'll meet you outside.

09:07.513 --> 09:12.050
Okay, okay, remember
that party bus

09:12.052 --> 09:16.054
I never wanted and you probably
don't want now?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.823
- Surprise!
- Good timing.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.659
I'm feeling suicidal,
and I've always wanted

09:20.661 --> 09:22.727
to be buried in something
like this.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.932
Aw, come on, Max, cheer up.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.368
You're getting two poles
for the price of one.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.037
This is the first time
a party bus

09:32.039 --> 09:35.040
hasn't fixed
every problem I have.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.541
Well, you haven't seen

09:36.543 --> 09:39.511
my "Stars and Stripes Forever"
routine.

09:39.513 --> 09:42.581
[hums John Sousa's
"Stars and Stripes Forever"]

09:57.096 --> 09:59.297
Um, Bert, is this rum

09:59.299 --> 10:02.601
supposed to have
a cigarette butt in it?

10:02.603 --> 10:04.603
If you gonna puke,
please aim for the floor.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.404
I can hose it down.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.641
Otherwise, I'm finding corn
in the pleather for months.

10:09.643 --> 10:13.745
Well, if I throw up today,
it's not 'cause I'm having fun.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.714
I'm just happy
because, finally,

10:15.716 --> 10:19.084
there's ladies in the bus
not wearing penis helmets.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.220
Nope, they were all
out of penises,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.555
so I had to settle for balls.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.156
Here, girls.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.392
Nope, I will day drink
on a bus,

10:27.394 --> 10:30.295
but I will not
put balls on my head.

10:30.297 --> 10:34.099
And you wonder
why you're single.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.135
Ugh, there's that crazy
expensive sushi place

10:37.137 --> 10:38.903
where Randy and I ate.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.972
And there's the taco place
we had to eat at afterwards

10:40.974 --> 10:42.774
'cause we were still hungry.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.011
Max, please, you have to
put Randy behind you.

10:46.013 --> 10:49.948
And there's the parking spot
where I put Randy behind me.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.750
Bert, did we sign up
for the Hollywood

10:51.752 --> 10:53.351
relationship death tour?

10:53.353 --> 10:57.522
If so, I'd like to hit
the Affleck-Garner house.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.992
And right up there
is where he lives.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.461
We'd make a right at that
super ripped homeless guy,

11:03.463 --> 11:06.431
and in two or three blocks,
we'd be at Randy's house.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.434
Oh, no, "we do this,"
and "we do that."

11:09.436 --> 11:10.602
She's "we"-ing.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.804
As long as nobody wees
on the seats,

11:12.806 --> 11:14.673
we'll be fine.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.708
Bert, turn off there,
up that street.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.443
No, wait, what are you doing?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.011
You're getting closure.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.480
I want him to face you
without that lame therapist.

11:22.482 --> 11:26.151
Just you and him
face-to-testicle.

11:26.153 --> 11:29.688
Ladies, just how stalker-y
are we getting here?

11:29.690 --> 11:32.290
Like a drive around
the cul-de-sac?

11:32.292 --> 11:36.227
Or a full-on Demi Moore outside
of Mila Kunis' yoga class?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.529
Ooh, there it is.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.030
Up there on the left.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.498
Yep, there it is.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.900
And there he is
letting the dog out.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.737
Oh, and he's only
wearing a towel.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.306
Ah, yeah.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.542
Now I get it, Max.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.243
Bert, go.
This was a bad idea.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.978
No, this is a great idea.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.847
I am not letting you
take this bad feeling

11:55.849 --> 11:57.215
back to New York.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.317
Bert, open the door.
I'm going out.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.924
Bert, close the door.
Let's roll.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.292
[knock at door]

12:12.064 --> 12:13.698
I, uh, wanted to put
some clothes on,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.433
but Caroline wouldn't let me.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.203
Oh, that's the smartest thing
Caroline's done

12:18.205 --> 12:20.438
since I've met her.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.173
Max.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.609
(Max)
I'm not here.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.779
Max, I can see your balls
behind that pillow.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.014
I can see your balls
behind that--

12:30.016 --> 12:32.083
Sophie!
Come on.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.618
This is sad.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.920
Oh, well not from where
I'm sitting.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.891
Max, I'm sorry about the way
I handled things.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.693
I just don't know how
to break things off.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.894
It's why I was the lawyer

12:42.896 --> 12:46.297
on the last three
Adam Sandler movies.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.632
Why?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.467
I just need to know why.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.803
Because I'm too young?
I'm too old?

12:51.805 --> 12:54.272
Is there someone else?
You're married? You're gay?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.208
With a body like that,
gay is definitely on the table.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.213
You want the truth?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.215
I like you too much.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.717
That's why I didn't
break it off sooner.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.585
I didn't want it to end.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.621
That's why you're
breaking up with me?

13:09.623 --> 13:12.724
Because you like me too much?

13:12.726 --> 13:15.160
At least have another family
in Mexico.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.395
Max, I've done
the long-distance thing.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.764
It's just putting off
the inevitable.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.400
You have a life there.
I have a life here.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.569
It doesn't work.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.572
Please don't hate me.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.407
Be easier if I could.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.977
Yep, here they come.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.347
Pardon me?

13:36.349 --> 13:40.018
Are we still firing
your housekeeper today?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.620
Oh, nice hat.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.789
Confirms that theory
that women in LA

13:44.791 --> 13:46.324
are the ones with balls.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.833
This is it, girls.

13:54.835 --> 13:59.437
This is where my healer
does all her magic.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.506
Yeah, you know, she must
sweat a lot doing it,

14:01.508 --> 14:05.944
'cause it smells like it looks
in here, right?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.046
What do you think's
in those jars?

14:08.048 --> 14:12.550
Every fart that's ever
been held in at yoga?

14:12.552 --> 14:13.952
Are you okay, Max?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.286
I guess.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.788
I just wish you told me closure

14:16.790 --> 14:18.289
feels like someone just
slammed my nuts

14:18.291 --> 14:21.559
in the trunk of a Pontiac.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.962
Sophie, we have to be
at the airport in an hour.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.332
Yes, but Audra is my last chance
at getting pregnant.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.367
She'll be ready
when she's ready.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.002
I mean, look around.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.737
She's a professional.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.608
[humming]

14:37.977 --> 14:40.178
Have you seen an orange cat?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.982
A little depressed,
Sagittarius?

14:43.984 --> 14:46.918
Wait, Garfield lives here?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.887
Audra, this is
Max and Caroline.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.723
You know,
I rarely say this to a lady,

14:51.725 --> 14:56.194
but--oh, put a baby in me.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.863
Absolutely.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.265
Hmm?

15:00.267 --> 15:03.868
You think--you don't--okay.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.838
Go ahead.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.908
I'm sorry, I'm just conferring
with my spirit guides.

15:09.910 --> 15:13.311
Well, if you all talk at once,
I can't understand you.

15:15.381 --> 15:19.717
Got it.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.220
They're telling me
that someone here

15:22.222 --> 15:24.389
just had their heart broken.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.424
It's you.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.192
Oh, my God, Max.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.895
Come closer to me.
Come over here.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.931
Oh, gosh, thanks a lot.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.933
You're bogarting my witch.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.070
These spirits don't lie.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.305
Mm-mm.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.240
A little too honest sometimes.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.243
I mean, I didn't ask them
if they like my bangs,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.645
but they sure told me.

15:47.647 --> 15:51.082
It was a whole thing.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.116
You don't need to help me.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.885
I'll get over the Randy thing.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.219
I've been through worse things,

15:55.221 --> 15:56.554
like this right now.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.989
No.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.058
They're insisting
that I help you.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.293
Grab me a jar.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.629
That's where we
store the pain...

16:04.631 --> 16:06.564
and lentils, once you're healed.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.974
Great.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.810
No guy, but now I have a
middle-aged lesbian lover.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.148
[chanting, humming]

16:28.988 --> 16:32.056
[chanting, humming]

16:34.426 --> 16:36.160
All right, it's out.

16:41.367 --> 16:45.436
I thought I was gonna have to
move to a bigger jar.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.973
You must've really
liked this guy.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.541
He was okay.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.977
Well, he's crushed.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.546
He really liked you too.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.281
Never thought a jar
could make me feel better

16:57.283 --> 16:59.717
that wasn't filled
with peanut brittle.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.955
Oh, please, spirits,
put a baby in me!

17:05.724 --> 17:08.659
All right, here we go.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.862
Quiet, everybody.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.163
Let me just close the door.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.665
Okay.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.035
Oh, wait.

17:17.037 --> 17:21.172
There's still some other
unrest here.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.175
[chanting, humming]

17:24.177 --> 17:27.245
Oh, no,
that's way too big.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.253
It's something else.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.993
Oh, really?

17:41.995 --> 17:44.395
Oh, you're telling--

17:44.397 --> 17:47.398
Sure, sure.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.601
Okay. Hold on.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.404
I can't put a baby in you.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.239
(both)
Sorry, Sophie.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.508
You can't?

17:57.510 --> 18:01.712
You made me put needles
in my eyes.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.248
Put me on with them.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.517
Hey, I'm on your side.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.153
Her bangs are ridiculous.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.595
Hey, Earl, we're back.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.232
Hi, girls.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.434
Let me be the first to say
welcome back,

18:23.436 --> 18:26.537
and also,
my deepest sympathies.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.905
How are you, Max?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.107
I just flew in from LA,

18:29.109 --> 18:31.609
and boy, are my arms tired

18:31.611 --> 18:34.278
from hitting the person
next to me.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.114
They would not stop fidgeting.

18:36.116 --> 18:40.051
I had to pee,
and you wouldn't let me out.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.253
Max, Caroline, you're back!

18:42.255 --> 18:45.156
I mean...
hello, how are you?

18:46.492 --> 18:49.093
Han, did you miss us?

18:49.095 --> 18:54.799
Oh, please, I miss you like
America misses RadioShack.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.302
Surprisingly, it left a hole.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.005
I saw you leave a hole once...

19:01.007 --> 19:02.373
on Groundhog Day.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.011
Max, Caroline,
where's Sophie?

19:07.013 --> 19:08.112
I missed her so much.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.847
You know what they say:

19:09.849 --> 19:14.152
absence makes me have to
masturbate almost constantly.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.821
So what did the healer say?

19:16.823 --> 19:19.123
We'll let her tell you.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.360
Hey, everybody!

19:22.362 --> 19:25.163
I'm back from California.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.131
[with Californian accent]
I hope I didn't, like,

19:27.133 --> 19:31.035
totally pick up an accent,
dude.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.005
Oh, I was worried
Jeremy Renner

19:34.007 --> 19:37.275
would make you the last thing
he'd ever be in.

19:39.444 --> 19:43.881
And I was worried you'd say
something exactly like that.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.784
Well, I'll be in my booth.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.288
So what did the healer say?

19:50.290 --> 19:53.324
How soon can we
get a baby in you?

19:53.326 --> 19:58.863
Oh, well, the truth is, Oleg,

19:58.865 --> 20:01.065
the healer said that she
wouldn't be able

20:01.067 --> 20:03.834
to help me get pregnant.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.205
Oh, Sophie.
Why not?

20:07.207 --> 20:10.308
Well, the reason

20:10.310 --> 20:13.911
that I can't get pregnant is...

20:15.647 --> 20:17.748
I'm already pregnant!

20:20.586 --> 20:22.420
Yeah!

20:22.422 --> 20:23.921
I'm gonna be a father?

20:23.923 --> 20:26.257
Yes, I'm three months along.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.226
Yeah, no, that's the last time

20:28.228 --> 20:32.396
I'll buy a pregnancy test
off a boat.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.432
Well, let's bust out
the very cheap,

20:34.434 --> 20:36.400
non-alcoholic champagne.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.236
Non-alcoholic?

20:38.238 --> 20:40.404
Yeah, Sophie can't drink
when she's pregnant.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.706
Oh, all right.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.708
Well, then,
the five martinis

20:43.710 --> 20:46.777
that I had on the plane
were my last.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.115
