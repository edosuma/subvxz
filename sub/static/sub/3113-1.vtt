00:42.200 --> 00:45.046
What can I do to make you stay?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.322
Huh?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.999
- You're the light of my eyes.
- Oh!

00:56.000 --> 00:58.279
I bet you say that to all the girls.

00:58.280 --> 01:03.083
Normally I talk about the shiny
hair or... something like that.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.366
...I don't wanna go home.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.730
Then don't.

01:11.960 --> 01:16.490
I'm starting uni, real life.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.679
But we can make it work. I'll...

01:18.680 --> 01:21.242
Taylor, this is real life.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.850
I love you.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.319
Business or holiday?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.210

03:04.720 --> 03:07.202
<i>Just one day out of life</i>

03:08.880 --> 03:11.009
<i>It would be</i>

03:11.080 --> 03:13.159
<i>It would be so nice</i>

03:13.160 --> 03:15.403
<i>Everybody spread the word</i>

03:17.080 --> 03:22.202
<i>We're gonna have a celebration</i>

03:26.520 --> 03:29.810

03:37.960 --> 03:39.759

03:39.760 --> 03:42.799

03:42.800 --> 03:45.839

<i>Come together in every nation</i>

04:36.520 --> 04:38.684
<i>Whooo</i>

05:04.440 --> 05:06.399
Your first time in Puglia?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.839
No, I was here three years ago.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.005
<i>We need a holiday</i>

05:26.600 --> 05:28.490
T-bag!

05:28.520 --> 05:30.719
T-bag is here!

05:30.720 --> 05:33.159
It's so good to see you.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.639
My little pupalina.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.319
- Ah! Grazie mille.
- Prego.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.519
Come on!

05:38.520 --> 05:41.919
So... how was the flight?
How were the exams?

05:41.920 --> 05:45.599
Is it raining in England? Tell me
it's raining. It's raining, isn't it?

05:45.600 --> 05:49.679
- This place is...
- Wait till you see the inside. Come on!

05:55.680 --> 05:58.082
Oh, my God!

05:59.520 --> 06:01.759
It's not quite the pensione
I recommended.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.322
Isn't it heaven?

06:05.280 --> 06:07.045
So...

06:07.240 --> 06:09.519
- How are you?
- Fabulous!

06:09.520 --> 06:10.919
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.639
- What's on your iPod?
- Er... I don't know.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.959
But I can tell you it would not
be "Nothing Compares To You".

06:16.960 --> 06:18.719
Don't tell me you're
actually over Doug?

06:18.720 --> 06:22.919
Doug who? This is the best
holiday ever. I'm in love.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.879
- Puglia's beautiful, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.439
I knew you'd love it.
Thanks for flying me out.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.047
Hey, I wanted to celebrate
your graduation.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.359
Congratulations on being officially
the clever one, by the way.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.719
Thank you. You'll always
be better at ballet.

06:35.720 --> 06:41.126
Hmm... true. So bringing you
here was surprise number one.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.799
- Are you decent?
- Who, me?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.087
Lil!

06:48.040 --> 06:49.959
Oh, my God!

06:49.960 --> 06:52.119
My little professor.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.119
Maddie never said you'd be here.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.959
Oh, well, when she told me
Doug had dumped her,

06:55.960 --> 06:59.199
I was like, "Yes,
hallelujah, man-tox time!"

06:59.200 --> 07:02.444
And is there a better way
to spend my book advance?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.519
- Tiziana.
- Eh?

07:05.520 --> 07:08.799
More Aperol Spritz, please?

07:08.800 --> 07:09.759
Si.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.369
- And a glass for you.
- Per me?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.639
- She's a bit grumpy.
- Nice Italian, though.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.566
Oh, she has got very familiar
with the Italian tongue.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.121
So tell her.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.442
I'm getting married.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.719
Sorry, I thought you said
you were getting married.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.399
Isn't it amazing?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.239
- Oh, my God! Not to Doug?
- Oh, God, no!

07:39.240 --> 07:43.519
But... you're on man-tox.
You're supposed to be finding yourself.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.599
Well, I did. Here I am.
And there he was, so there we are.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.959
Are you crazy? How long
have you known this guy?

07:50.960 --> 07:54.919
Five weeks, but it's enough.
When you know, you know, you know?

07:54.920 --> 07:58.759
You said that about Doug...
and Marcel and Connor.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.119
And Tarquin.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.599
This is different, he's...

08:02.600 --> 08:05.919
sensitive and kind and gentle.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.619
- Definitely not Doug, then.
- He's just the most wonderful thing...

08:09.840 --> 08:12.607
- Grazie.
- Prego.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.729
At least tell me it's
a long engagement.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.959
That's why I had to get you here.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.363
The wedding is in two days.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.488
- That is insane.
- I know!

08:26.960 --> 08:29.909
- Don't look at me. Puglia was your idea.
- I don't remember telling her to...

08:29.911 --> 08:32.159
marry the first man she found
when she got out of the taxi.

08:32.159 --> 08:37.009
He's wasn't the first man.
He was, like, at least the fourth.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.759
- Have you lost your mind?
- Mmm.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.438
Look, T, I was freaked out as well,

08:43.440 --> 08:47.401
but he is a great guy and
you know I never say that.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.159
I just can't believe
he wants to marry me.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.839
Oh, God, please don't
start that again.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.361
You know why.

08:56.520 --> 09:00.319
- I do?
- Yes. Because you're a goddess.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.199
Yes, well, I suppose that must be it.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.926
<i>Goddess on a mountaintop</i>

09:11.000 --> 09:13.402
<i>Burning like a silver flame</i>

09:14.520 --> 09:18.083
<i>The summit of beauty and love</i>

09:18.880 --> 09:20.519
<i>And Venus was her name...</i>

09:20.520 --> 09:22.119
Whoa!

09:22.120 --> 09:23.487
<i>She's got it</i>

09:24.800 --> 09:27.521
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

09:30.360 --> 09:32.199
<i>I'm your Venus</i>

09:32.200 --> 09:33.359
<i>I'm your fire</i>

09:33.360 --> 09:35.285
<i>Your desire</i>

09:37.040 --> 09:39.239
<i>Well, I'm your Venus</i>

09:39.240 --> 09:41.319
<i>I'm your fire</i>

09:41.320 --> 09:43.609
<i>Your desire</i>

09:45.080 --> 09:49.119
<i>Her weapons were her crystal eyes</i>

09:49.120 --> 09:51.966
<i>Making every man mad</i>

09:52.880 --> 09:55.919
<i>Black as the dark night she was</i>

09:55.920 --> 09:59.199
<i>Got what no one else had...</i>

09:59.200 --> 10:00.319
Tss!

10:00.320 --> 10:02.404
<i>She's got it</i>

10:02.920 --> 10:05.482
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

10:08.560 --> 10:10.359
<i>I'm your Venus</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:11.919
<i>I'm your fire</i>

10:11.920 --> 10:14.004
<i>Your desire</i>

10:15.000 --> 10:17.639
<i>Well, I'm your Venus</i>

10:17.640 --> 10:19.199
<i>I'm your fire</i>

10:19.200 --> 10:22.251
<i>Your desire</i>

10:48.280 --> 10:49.839
<i>Venus</i>

10:49.840 --> 10:51.082
<i>She's got it</i>

10:52.400 --> 10:55.007
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it...</i>

11:02.800 --> 11:05.328
Ooh... really sorry.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.689
<i>Goddess on a mountaintop</i>

11:09.000 --> 11:12.609
<i>Burning like a silver flame</i>

11:12.800 --> 11:16.204
<i>The summit of beauty and love</i>

11:16.560 --> 11:18.724
<i>And Venus was her name</i>

11:22.600 --> 11:26.288
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

11:35.600 --> 11:37.411
<i>She's got it</i>

11:37.960 --> 11:41.489
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

11:43.760 --> 11:45.599
<i>I'm your Venus</i>

11:45.600 --> 11:46.959
<i>I'm your fire</i>

11:46.960 --> 11:49.363
<i>Your desire</i>

11:50.440 --> 11:52.799
<i>Yeah, I'm your Venus</i>

11:52.800 --> 11:54.639
<i>I'm your fire</i>

11:54.640 --> 11:56.201
<i>Your desire</i>

12:21.360 --> 12:24.359
What? What am I supposed
to say? I'm thrilled?

12:24.360 --> 12:26.919
- Well...
- I'm thrilled it's not Doug.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.402
I'll drink to that.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.079
I look forward to meeting him.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.610
Well, you will, tonight. There's a dinner.
You're gonna love him.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.683
Anyway... what about you?
Anything to report?

12:41.440 --> 12:44.759
Finals went OK. I may
have messed up one paper.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.970
No, I don't mean boring stuff.
I meant boys.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.439
Oh, come on! You're out
of the library now.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.039
You've got to let your hair down
and your inner goddess out.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.759
I'm not like you. I don't go all wobbly
every time a boy takes his shirt off.

12:58.760 --> 13:03.245
Maybe she's just saving
herself for her old flame?

13:04.120 --> 13:05.239
Who? What?

13:05.240 --> 13:08.968
- This is where T fell in love too, isn't it?
- Taylor doesn't fall in love,

13:08.970 --> 13:11.840
- she's too sensible.
- OK.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.079
What? I'm your sister and
I don't know this. Hello?

13:17.080 --> 13:18.959
It was just a holiday romance.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.519
Just a holiday romance?
Why didn't you tell me?

13:22.520 --> 13:24.879
You were in the middle of one of
your worst breakups with Doug.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.679
So, what happened?

13:26.680 --> 13:31.519
Nothing. The holiday ended and uni
started and life just got in the way.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.679
This is so exciting! You're back here.
Maybe you could rekindle the whole thing.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.519
No...

13:37.520 --> 13:39.119
He was off to travel the world.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.959
Exs are like fireworks.
Never go back to them.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.727
Either they blow up
in your face or...

13:47.240 --> 13:48.688
Or they go all limp.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.959
I think I might get changed
and pop down to the beach.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.045
See if I recognise any
of the old crowd.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.244
OK.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.081
Taylor!

14:29.840 --> 14:31.079
Oh, my God!

14:31.080 --> 14:33.879
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you're here!

14:33.880 --> 14:35.959
Three years we've been waiting
for you, We'd given up.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.999
- And you, when did you get back?
- I never left. I couldn't leave Enrico.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.640
What?

14:41.960 --> 14:43.771
Does Raf know you're here?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.770
Ciao, bella!

14:49.440 --> 14:51.239
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, that's nice!

14:51.240 --> 14:55.599
No, no. Dio mio, it's great to see you.
But it's been ages, babes.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.923
- Hello, stranger!
- Hi!

15:00.560 --> 15:04.279
- So, finally you come back, huh?
- Yes. How are you guys?

15:04.280 --> 15:07.159
- Good.
- Molto bene, grazie. Pretty much the same.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.239
- He's still sunburnt.
- Oi! That's a healthy colour, that.

15:10.240 --> 15:14.359
- And you guys are still together?
- Yeah, of course. Nothing changes.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.679
Yeah, but not everything
is the same, you know?

15:30.240 --> 15:33.919
<i>There's a boy I know</i>

15:33.920 --> 15:37.802
<i>He's the one I dream of</i>

15:38.160 --> 15:41.999
<i>Looks into my eyes</i>

15:42.000 --> 15:45.370
<i>Takes me to the clouds above</i>

15:46.400 --> 15:50.119
<i>Oh, I lose control</i>

15:50.120 --> 15:53.285
<i>Can't seem to get enough</i>

15:54.520 --> 15:58.199
<i>When I wake from dreaming</i>

15:58.200 --> 16:01.444
<i>Tell me, is it really love?</i>

16:03.080 --> 16:05.559
<i>Ooh, how will I know?</i>

16:05.560 --> 16:08.159
<i>Don't trust your feelings</i>

16:08.160 --> 16:11.723
<i>How will I know?</i>

16:12.560 --> 16:13.999
<i>How will I know?</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:16.239
<i>Love can be deceiving</i>

16:16.240 --> 16:19.559
<i>How will I know?</i>

16:19.560 --> 16:23.439
<i>- How will I know?
- If he really loves me</i>

16:23.440 --> 16:27.559
<i>- I'll say a prayer
- With every heartbeat</i>

16:27.560 --> 16:31.279
<i>- I fall in love
- Whenever we meet</i>

16:31.280 --> 16:34.799
<i>- My love is strong
- But I feel weak</i>

16:34.800 --> 16:38.439
<i>Oh, wake me, I'm shaking</i>

16:38.440 --> 16:41.923
<i>Wish I had him near me now</i>

16:42.840 --> 16:46.559
<i>Except there's no mistaking</i>

16:46.560 --> 16:49.566
<i>What I feel is really love</i>

16:50.920 --> 16:54.319
<i>Ooh, tell me, how will I know?</i>

16:54.320 --> 16:56.759
<i>Don't trust your feelings</i>

16:56.760 --> 17:00.004
<i>How will I know?</i>

17:00.640 --> 17:02.239
<i>How will I know?</i>

17:02.240 --> 17:04.638
<i>Love can be deceiving</i>

17:04.640 --> 17:06.679
<i>How will I know?</i>

17:06.680 --> 17:09.002
<i>If he loves me</i>

17:10.880 --> 17:13.442
<i>If he loves me not</i>

17:15.160 --> 17:17.289
<i>If he loves me</i>

17:19.040 --> 17:22.919
<i>If he loves me not, oh</i>

17:22.920 --> 17:25.925
<i>How will I know?</i>

17:36.120 --> 17:37.363
Taylor?

17:41.280 --> 17:45.079
- I see you've met my fiancé.
- Your...

17:45.080 --> 17:47.926
What do you think?
A bit too gorgeous, isn't he?

17:49.360 --> 17:53.599
- This is your fiance?
- Yeah. Do you guys know each other?

17:53.600 --> 17:58.801
- Er...
- No! Hi, I'm Taylor, Maddie's sister.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.759
She... she's your sister?

18:06.760 --> 18:10.359
Yeah. Can't you see it?

18:10.360 --> 18:13.411
T and I are like peas in a pod.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.926
What is that?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.691
T is for Taylor.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.439
- T is for Taylor.
- What? Do you know these guys?

18:24.440 --> 18:28.999
No! Hi, I'm Taylor. Nice to
meet you. Hi, how are you?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.519
They're normally much friendlier
than this. Guys, it's my sister.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.679
- Ah-ha! Well, welcome to Puglia, Taylor.
- Taylor, hi.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.959
Oh, so that's why you're here,
for your sister's wedding.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.639
Yes, yes! And I am just so excited!

18:42.640 --> 18:45.805
I knew you'd approve once
you met him. Isn't he divine?

18:47.520 --> 18:51.279
Yes, er... sorry, sunstroke!

18:51.280 --> 18:53.559
I think I need to go and
lie down in a dark room.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.406
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no. I'll be fine.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.610
Taylor.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.445
Taylor! Are you all right?

19:07.960 --> 19:11.199
- I just don't want Maddie to know.
- But you and Raf...

19:11.200 --> 19:15.559
A holiday romance, years ago.
It was so totally nothing.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.681
It's better to just pretend it never
happened because it pretty much never did.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.159
OK, if you say so.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.643
- I'll see you at the dinner.
- Yeah.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.719
- Have you got a husband at home?
- Several but, none of them are mine.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.119
No, I don't do romance,
marriage or biological clocks.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.399
Oh, Lil, everyone needs
a man sometimes.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.121
I just change the battery.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.570
So, Lil, what do you do?

19:49.840 --> 19:52.919
I write erotic fiction.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.359
Ooh...

19:54.360 --> 19:57.959
If you need any help researching,
I'd be happy to, er...

19:57.960 --> 20:00.959
I'm in Italy, babe. I'm not
ordering the fish and chips.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.443
- I'm spaghetti bloody vongole!
- I can't believe they're sisters.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.363
Why not?

20:07.760 --> 20:11.482
Er... yeah, like,
you're just... sisters.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.079
What?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.959
Come on, Rafa, speech.

20:16.960 --> 20:21.809
Give it up for the man
himself, mio migliore amico.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.679
That was beautiful, Mikey. Thank you.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.999
- No, you're beautiful.
- No, you're beautiful.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.559
I could just stare at him all day.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.962
Er... I'm getting married.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.205
- Yes, Raf.
- Hey!

20:35.360 --> 20:37.679
- Miss Maddie.
- Mm-hmm.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.879
My friends can tell you that I don't
really, usually, fall in love so easy.

20:41.880 --> 20:47.366
But... with you it was
truly love at first sight.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.083
What can I say?

20:54.760 --> 20:57.003
You're amazing.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.199
Passionate.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.759
Brave.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.519
Not afraid to show the
world how you feel.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.491
I'm just so lucky you're mine.

21:14.520 --> 21:18.003
- To Maddie.
- To Maddie.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.679
All right, babe, your turn.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.799
- Oh, no, no...
- Yeah.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.039
OK, yes, yes, yes.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.399
Er... well, I know that this has come
as a bit of a surprise to some of you,

21:28.400 --> 21:30.439
not least to myself.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.719
Er...

21:31.720 --> 21:35.727
T... Mum's not with us anymore,

21:36.200 --> 21:40.400
but, er... well, you and Lil
are all the family I need.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.999
You were the one who sent me here
and I can't thank you enough

21:44.000 --> 21:46.688
because look what I found.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.359
Er... I've made a lot of
mistakes over the years,

21:50.360 --> 21:53.559
and, Raf, I have to be honest,
when I met you, I thought,

21:53.560 --> 21:55.399
"He's gonna be another
one that won't last.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.279
"It's just another holiday romance."

21:58.280 --> 22:02.519
But then suddenly I knew that some holiday
romances are meant to last forever.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.965
<i>The power of love is a curious thing</i>

22:10.320 --> 22:14.359
<i>Make a one man weep,
make another man sing</i>

22:14.360 --> 22:18.399
<i>Change a hawk to a little white dove</i>

22:18.400 --> 22:22.566
<i>More than a feeling,
that's the power of love</i>

22:26.440 --> 22:29.919
<i>Tougher than diamonds,
rich like cream</i>

22:29.920 --> 22:34.564
<i>Stronger and harder
than a bad girl's dream</i>

22:34.640 --> 22:38.719
<i>Make a bad one good,
make a wrong one right</i>

22:38.720 --> 22:42.761
<i>Power of love that
keeps you home at night</i>

22:42.960 --> 22:46.639
<i>Don't need money, don't take fame</i>

22:46.640 --> 22:50.283
<i>Don't need no credit
card to ride this train</i>

22:50.440 --> 22:54.759
<i>It's strong and it's sudden
and it's cruel sometimes</i>

22:54.760 --> 22:58.919
<i>But it might just save your life</i>

22:58.920 --> 23:02.085
<i>That's the power of love</i>

23:03.240 --> 23:07.087
<i>That's the power of love</i>

23:08.840 --> 23:12.879
<i>First time you feel it
it might make you sad</i>

23:12.880 --> 23:16.807
<i>Next time you feel it
it might make you mad</i>

23:16.880 --> 23:21.159
<i>But you'll be glad, baby,
when you've found</i>

23:21.160 --> 23:25.519
<i>That's the power,
makes the world go round</i>

23:25.520 --> 23:29.519
<i>Don't take money, don't take fame</i>

23:29.520 --> 23:32.999
<i>Don't need no credit
card to ride this train</i>

23:33.000 --> 23:36.999
<i>It's strong and it's sudden
and it'll be cruel sometimes</i>

23:37.000 --> 23:41.849
<i>But it might just save your life</i>

23:42.000 --> 23:46.839
<i>They say that all in love is fair</i>

23:46.840 --> 23:50.119
<i>Yeah, but you don't care</i>

23:50.120 --> 23:54.279
<i>- But you'll know what to do
- What do to</i>

23:54.280 --> 23:58.159
<i>When it gets hold of you</i>

23:58.160 --> 24:01.719
<i>And with a little help from above</i>

24:01.720 --> 24:05.841
<i>You feel the power of love...</i>

24:25.320 --> 24:27.324
Whoo!

24:36.440 --> 24:40.159
<i>Don't take money, don't take fame</i>

24:40.160 --> 24:44.079
<i>Don't need no credit
card to ride this train</i>

24:44.080 --> 24:48.359
<i>Tougher than diamonds
and stronger than steel</i>

24:48.360 --> 24:52.399
<i>You won't feel nothing till you feel</i>

24:52.400 --> 24:54.319
<i>You feel the power</i>

24:54.320 --> 24:56.519
<i>Just feel the power of love</i>

24:56.520 --> 24:58.439
<i>That's the power</i>

24:58.440 --> 25:00.399
<i>That's the power of love</i>

25:00.400 --> 25:02.599
<i>You feel the power</i>

25:02.600 --> 25:05.970
<i>You feel the power of love</i>

25:06.600 --> 25:10.163
<i>You feel the power of love</i>

25:10.640 --> 25:12.719
<i>You feel the power of love</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:14.679
<i>That's the power</i>

25:14.680 --> 25:16.599
<i>That's the power of love</i>

25:16.600 --> 25:18.719
<i>You feel the power</i>

25:18.720 --> 25:21.964
<i>You feel the power of love</i>

25:22.840 --> 25:26.084
<i>You feel the power of love</i>

25:26.840 --> 25:30.801
<i>You feel the power of love</i>

25:32.560 --> 25:34.199
Taylor.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.045
Hey!

25:36.160 --> 25:38.919
Nice to see you again.
This is crazy, huh?

25:38.920 --> 25:41.519
Yeah, but that's Maddie.
She loves a big show.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.759
I mean, I had no idea
Maddie was your sister.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.242
Yeah, she has been my whole life.

25:46.680 --> 25:50.039
I understand, but...
But if I'd known, I would never...

25:50.040 --> 25:52.799
- But we're in love, so...
- Yes.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.359
And I'm so thrilled. Congratulations.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.439
Thank you, and I'm
pleased you graduated.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.759
That was what you wanted, right?
So, er... congratulations to you too.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.650
Thanks.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.559
- OK, this is weird.
- No, it's not.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.319
It's the opposite of weird,
it's totally 'unweird'.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.166
- We gotta tell her.
- No.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.959
OK, maybe it is a bit weird.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.679
But just because it's weird for us doesn't
mean it needs to be weird for Mads.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.879
- I don't wanna keep secrets from her.
- She's my sister.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.839
She means everything to me. If anyone
deserves to be happy, it's her.

26:31.840 --> 26:36.679
So let's just forget it
ever happened, please,

26:36.680 --> 26:39.439
and keep out of each other's way.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.999
- There you are.
- Hey!

26:42.000 --> 26:43.959
- Getting to know each other already?
- Yeah.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.039
Great, because I have a few wedding-y
things I need you to do for me tomorrow,

26:47.040 --> 26:51.039
like help Raf sort out his suit,
make sure he looks gorgeous for me.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.999
You'll get on like a house on fire.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.210
So much for you to talk about!

26:57.640 --> 27:00.079
Whoop! Whoo!

27:00.080 --> 27:02.642
Hey, guys, I'm coming!

27:26.640 --> 27:28.849
I thought you wanted
to kite-surf the world.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.161
We are. The honeymoon.

27:33.680 --> 27:37.971
Oh, funny. Maddie always
said she wanted Paris.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.689
Would you like to try them on?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.719
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not the bride, I'm...

27:44.720 --> 27:47.159
It's someone else that
he's marrying. I'm no one.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.559
I'm just a friend. I mean,
the sister of the bride.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.399
I guess what people want can change.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.801
Perfect.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.903
I didn't change, Raf. I just couldn't
drop everything and run off...

28:02.905 --> 28:08.039
- into the sunset with you.
- Yeah, I know. Your "real life", right?

28:08.040 --> 28:11.159
- How's that working out for you now?
- Great!

28:11.160 --> 28:13.005
Cool.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.642
Are you seeing anyone?

28:17.960 --> 28:21.439
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Oh, sorry.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.966
Why are you sorry?

28:24.680 --> 28:26.639
Well, that's a no, isn't it?

28:26.640 --> 28:30.319
No, actually, it's not necessarily a no.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

28:30.320 --> 28:34.406
I think that sort of thing is private and
doesn't need to be sung from the rooftops.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.199
I forgot. Never say
what you feel, right?

28:38.200 --> 28:41.839
I just don't see why people have to make
such a spectacle of their feelings.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.224
Because if someone sings
it from the rooftops,

28:44.226 --> 28:49.404
you know that they really mean it,
and that's what weddings are all about.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.159
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.719
What do you want me to do,
Taylor? Become a monk?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.919
I don't know, maybe not
fall in love with my sister?

28:59.920 --> 29:03.599
But how could I know she was your sister?
I never met two people less like each other.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.879
What's that supposed to mean?

29:05.880 --> 29:08.123
- Ciao.
- Salve.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.039
You're the one who broke it off,
and you forgot all about me!

29:15.040 --> 29:18.439
I didn't forget about you,
I was working on my degree.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.599
Whatever.

29:19.600 --> 29:23.359
And, anyway, I'm not the one who spends all
his days on the beach with hot girls in bikinis.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.679
Come on! You know I
wasn't interested in them.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.119
I was waiting for you to
come back, like you said,

29:28.120 --> 29:31.251
but then I realised you weren't,
and then I met Maddie,

29:31.280 --> 29:35.163
and she was so open,
so positive, so full of life.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.239
Full of life?
So I'm not full of life?

29:38.240 --> 29:40.199
But... maybe you are,
but how would anyone know?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.319
We shouldn't be listening to this.
Come on, let's go.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.087
"Don't make a spectacle
of your feelings."

29:48.200 --> 29:51.759
Maddie made me happy again, OK?
She brought me back to life.

29:51.760 --> 29:55.039
How many times do I have to
say how happy I am for you?

29:55.040 --> 29:58.284
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not angry!

30:14.640 --> 30:16.849
I think we're done.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.559
Oh! Doug!

30:34.560 --> 30:36.371
Oh, you do miss me.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.839
What are you doing here?

30:38.840 --> 30:44.451
I'm hereto rescue you from making
the worst mistake of your life.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.639
That is so sweet.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.042
Only you were the worst
mistake of my life, so...

30:50.360 --> 30:51.999
Mads, Mads, Mads, Mads, come on!

30:52.000 --> 30:55.879
I know we've had our ups and downs,
but that's all part of our thing, isn't it?

30:55.880 --> 31:01.839
It's a ride. It's a great,
fun, sexy rollercoaster.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.199
All right, maybe we've had a big
down these last few months.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.319
You dumped me!

31:05.320 --> 31:08.719
That just means we're due for
a big up. Know what I'm saying?

31:08.720 --> 31:09.839
Bobcat...

31:09.840 --> 31:16.039
Doug, I don't want your great,
big, sexy... ride anymore.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.283
I want to get off.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.359
I should never have let
you go, Madison Jones.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.519
Hmm...

31:25.520 --> 31:28.359
I messed up. I'm man
enough to admit that.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.559
Oh, this again!

31:29.560 --> 31:32.359
Come on, we are incredible together.
You know that.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.359
Just go!

31:34.360 --> 31:38.599
One more chance.
Come on, you owe me that.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.439
I don't owe you anything,
except maybe a smack.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.079
How can you say that?

31:46.080 --> 31:51.519
<i>You were working as
a waitress in a cocktail bar</i>

31:51.520 --> 31:54.127
<i>When I met you</i>

31:54.600 --> 31:58.766
<i>I picked you out, I shook you up,
and turned you around</i>

31:58.880 --> 32:02.799
<i>Turned you into someone new</i>

32:02.800 --> 32:06.839
<i>Now five years later on you've
got the world at your feet</i>

32:06.840 --> 32:10.999
<i>Success has been so easy for you</i>

32:11.000 --> 32:14.839
<i>But don't forget it's me who
put you where you are now...</i>

32:14.840 --> 32:19.319
- Sorry!
<i>- And I can put you back down too</i>

32:19.320 --> 32:23.279
<i>- Don't, don't you want me?</i>
- This is why I don't want to see you.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.279
<i>You know I can't believe it when
I hear that you won't see me</i>

32:27.280 --> 32:29.839
<i>Don't, don't you want me?</i>

32:29.840 --> 32:31.599
The idea that I can't
survive without you!

32:31.600 --> 32:35.639
<i>You know I don't believe you when
you say that you don't need me</i>

32:35.640 --> 32:39.599
<i>It's much too late to find you
think you've changed your mind</i>

32:39.600 --> 32:43.919
<i>You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry</i>

32:43.920 --> 32:48.120
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

32:48.280 --> 32:52.119
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

32:52.120 --> 32:56.399
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

32:56.400 --> 32:59.799
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

32:59.800 --> 33:04.524
<i>I was working as a
waitress in a cocktail bar</i>

33:04.920 --> 33:08.079
<i>That much is true</i>

33:08.080 --> 33:11.689
<i>But even then I knew I'd
find a much better place</i>

33:12.600 --> 33:16.199
<i>Either with or without you</i>

33:16.200 --> 33:20.924
<i>The five years we have had
have been such good times</i>

33:21.240 --> 33:24.120
<i>I still love you</i>

33:24.600 --> 33:28.719
<i>But now I think it's time
I lived my life as my own</i>

33:28.720 --> 33:32.719
<i>I guess it's just what I must do</i>

33:32.720 --> 33:36.761
<i>Don't, don't you want me?</i>

33:36.840 --> 33:41.159
<i>You know I can't believe it
when I hear that you won't see me</i>

33:41.160 --> 33:44.723
<i>Don't, don't you want me?</i>

33:45.040 --> 33:49.239
<i>You know I don't believe you when
you say that you don't need me</i>

33:49.240 --> 33:52.599
<i>It's much too late to find you
think you've changed your mind</i>

33:52.600 --> 33:57.439
<i>You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry</i>

33:57.440 --> 34:01.839
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

34:01.840 --> 34:05.679
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

34:05.680 --> 34:09.243
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

34:10.080 --> 34:13.723
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

34:22.159 --> 34:26.079
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

34:26.080 --> 34:30.319
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

34:30.320 --> 34:34.239
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

34:34.239 --> 34:38.359
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

34:38.360 --> 34:42.918
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

34:42.920 --> 34:46.005
<i>Don't you want me, oh?</i>

34:48.320 --> 34:52.202
Which part of "I don't want you"
don't you understand?

34:57.160 --> 34:58.925
The don't.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.761
I've been out with some jerks in my time,
but you are in a class of your own.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.039
Oh, thank you!

35:07.040 --> 35:09.599
Why did I put up with it for so long?

35:09.600 --> 35:13.243
The hope, I suppose, that some day you'd
be the one who'd go down on one knee.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.523
Certainly tried every other position.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.402
Just... leave me alone!

35:20.200 --> 35:22.602
All right, I get it.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.205
Had to try, right?

35:28.160 --> 35:30.005
I'll go.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.050
On one condition:
have dinner with me tonight.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.644
- It's my hen night.
- We'll do it early, very low-key.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.999
- No.
- Come on.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.239
If those five years meant
anything to you, one last meal.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.803
I can wish you well,
show you there's no hard feeling.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.321
And then you'll go?

35:54.280 --> 35:55.399
On my honour.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.719
OK.

36:04.720 --> 36:08.966
- What's he doing here?
- Lil...

36:09.440 --> 36:14.641
Oh, you're such a good friend to Maddie. She
always looks so great standing next to you.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.399
And you were always such
a good boyfriend to her,

36:18.400 --> 36:21.679
because she always looked so
young standing next to you.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.560
He's just leaving.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.009
See you tonight... love monkey.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.999
- Tonight?
- It's under control.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.879
It's never under control with Doug.
He's your kryptonite.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.850
And he's a dick.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.325
Hmm...

36:48.560 --> 36:50.239
Mmm...

36:50.240 --> 36:51.641
Aah...

36:53.040 --> 36:54.851
Yeah...

36:57.720 --> 36:59.879
It was horrible hearing Raf
and Taylor fight like that.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.119
They used to be so close.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.399
Is he still hurt that
she didn't come back?

37:05.400 --> 37:09.759
Or is it the stress of us having to
pretend we don't know Taylor?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.639
Or maybe it's just all the
stress of the wedding.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.246
Yeah, could be.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.959
Or could it be that they were
both body-snatched by aliens

37:15.960 --> 37:17.519
and are planning to
take over the universe?

37:17.520 --> 37:20.571
Whatever you think, amore.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.446
Whoa!

37:25.320 --> 37:27.404
I love it when you give
me your attention.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.571
Argh!

37:31.680 --> 37:35.959
Outrageous! Wanna play, do ya?

37:35.960 --> 37:37.159
What's your problem?

37:37.160 --> 37:40.279
My problem is that I hate lying and
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.523
Ooh, what's the secret?

37:43.680 --> 37:45.411
Er...

37:47.120 --> 37:49.409
I'm pregnant.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.160
Oh, my God! That's amazing.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.039
You're happy, right?

37:55.040 --> 37:58.039
Yeah, yeah, it's just really early days
and we're trying to keep it a secret.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.999
Oh, yeah, of course.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.639
Oh, but, wow!
And you, are you excited?

38:02.640 --> 38:04.079
Still taking it in, really.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.370
God, you guys are gonna make
the most amazing parents.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.571
What you gonna do?

38:15.960 --> 38:19.599
Ow! Please don't! Stop it, woman!

38:19.600 --> 38:20.719
How did you get on?

38:20.720 --> 38:23.361
- It was great.
- Really, really well.

38:26.600 --> 38:32.643
So, Taylor, is there someone you'd
like to invite to the wedding?

38:32.920 --> 38:34.679
How do you mean?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.919
Well, like a plus one.

38:36.920 --> 38:39.199
Oh, no.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.284
Well, what about the guy
from three years ago?

38:44.320 --> 38:46.319
What guy?

38:46.320 --> 38:49.679
Oh, that guy?
Er... no, forget about him.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.759
That guy, he's, er... he's gone.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.639
- I'll go for a swim, hmm?
- OK.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.691
Gone? Gone where?

39:01.040 --> 39:04.079
Just... gone, OK?

39:04.080 --> 39:06.359
Well, does he know how you feel?

39:06.360 --> 39:09.319
If you want someone,
you have to follow your heart.

39:09.320 --> 39:12.679
It might not be part of the plan but you can't
just do nothing, you have to tell them.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.559
He moved on. Please.

39:15.560 --> 39:20.399
- Oh, I'm sorry, hon.
- Why? Don't be sorry.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.359
Well, it would be nice for
you to have someone there.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.599
I'm not you. I'm fine by myself.

39:26.600 --> 39:32.279
- No one is fine by themselves.
- Yes, Maddie. You should try it sometime.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.839
Permesso...

39:33.840 --> 39:35.799
I got flowers for Madison Jones.

39:35.800 --> 39:40.919
Oh, gorgeous! Raf knows me so well.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.926
Oh, I love pink roses.

39:45.160 --> 39:49.919
"Looking forward to seeing
you tonight, Doug."

39:49.920 --> 39:52.482
What's he doing here?

39:53.080 --> 39:57.359
He just turned up out of
the blue and hijacked me.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.999
It's just a final farewell.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.279
Well, slamming the door in
his face said it perfectly.

40:01.280 --> 40:05.399
Well, it's nicer this way. Grazie.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.999
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I can look after myself.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.159
When? When have you ever
been able to look after yourself?

40:12.160 --> 40:14.679
Like, all the time.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.399
Yes, I'm out there, and yes,
sometimes I make mistakes.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.879
You think?

40:18.880 --> 40:22.919
I know, Taylor, OK?
But I live with those mistakes,

40:22.920 --> 40:26.599
and I don't expect anyone
else to sort them out for me.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.519
It's better than locking your heart
away, too scared of getting hurt.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.879
I've lived with your mistakes.

40:32.880 --> 40:35.679
Where do you think I've been
for the past five years?

40:35.680 --> 40:40.799
And three years before that?
And 18 months before that?

40:40.800 --> 40:44.999
Did it ever occur to you that maybe the
reason I'm not all over guys all the time

40:45.000 --> 40:50.486
is because I've seen what a fool you've
made of yourself again and again and again?

40:59.600 --> 41:02.639
Well, I'd rather be like
that than the other way.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.839
And if I've made you afraid of
opening yourself up to love,

41:04.840 --> 41:07.242
then I'm truly sorry.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.042
Is that my necklace?

41:15.720 --> 41:18.964
Just get off my stuff, OK?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.639
OK, ladies, break it up. Time to go.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.486
- Go where?
- The tomato festival.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.359
- I'm not in the mood.
- That's why you're coming.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.239
Oh, I wish I could, but I have a
team of brilliant people coming

41:33.240 --> 41:35.639
to pluck, wax and tint me
to within an inch of my life.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.719
Well, you're excused.

41:38.720 --> 41:41.088
You're not.

41:41.160 --> 41:47.399
I like tomatoes, I really do.
But a whole festival? It sounds lame.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.125
<i>Ow</i>

41:58.560 --> 42:00.291
<i>Ha</i>

42:01.240 --> 42:04.405
<i>Mmm, yeah</i>

42:04.680 --> 42:11.167
<i>I used to think maybe you loved me,
now, baby, I'm sure</i>

42:13.400 --> 42:19.443
<i>And I just can't wait till the day
when you knock on my door</i>

42:21.960 --> 42:28.766
<i>Now every time I go for the
mailbox, gotta hold myself down</i>

42:30.680 --> 42:35.961
<i>Cos I just can't wait till you
write me you're coming around</i>

42:38.160 --> 42:43.560
<i>I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh</i>

42:51.080 --> 42:53.039
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

42:53.040 --> 42:55.359
<i>- Hey
- All right now</i>

42:55.360 --> 42:58.843
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

43:05.320 --> 43:11.409
<i>I used to think maybe you loved me,
now I know that it's true</i>

43:13.920 --> 43:19.360
<i>But I don't wanna spend my
whole life just awaiting for you</i>

43:22.640 --> 43:28.919
<i>- And I don't want you back for the weekend
- Not back for a day</i>

43:28.920 --> 43:30.321
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

43:37.520 --> 43:44.644
<i>I said, "Baby, I just want you
back and I want you to stay"</i>

43:45.200 --> 43:50.600
<i>I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh</i>

43:58.320 --> 43:59.759
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

43:59.760 --> 44:02.679
<i>Hey, are you all right now?</i>

44:02.680 --> 44:04.439
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

44:04.440 --> 44:06.839
<i>Yeah, oh, yeah, now</i>

44:06.840 --> 44:08.969
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

44:15.640 --> 44:24.209
<i>Walking on sunshine</i>

44:24.800 --> 44:33.319
<i>I feel alive, I feel the love,
I feel the love that's really real</i>

44:33.320 --> 44:37.199
<i>I'm on sunshine, baby, oh</i>

44:37.200 --> 44:41.559
<i>I'm walking on sunshine, baby, oh</i>

44:41.560 --> 44:46.960
<i>I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh</i>

44:54.680 --> 44:56.199
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

44:56.200 --> 44:58.719
<i>Hey, all right, now</i>

44:58.720 --> 45:00.519
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

45:00.520 --> 45:04.720
<i>I'll say, I'll say, I'll say,
I'll say, I'll say it again now</i>

45:04.880 --> 45:09.001
<i>I'll say, I'll say, I'll say,
I'll say, I'll say it again</i>

45:09.080 --> 45:17.319
<i>And don't, and don't, and don't,
and don't, and don't it feel good?</i>

45:17.320 --> 45:18.679
<i>Sunshine</i>

45:18.680 --> 45:20.730
<i>Don't it feel good now?</i>

45:40.560 --> 45:42.291
Is that it?

45:43.520 --> 45:46.759
We gotta get clean
before it dries. Come on.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.491
Where?

46:04.160 --> 46:05.925
Oh!

46:49.720 --> 46:51.610
Low-key?

46:52.160 --> 46:54.403
You deserve a decent send-off.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.045
You look stunning.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.602
Well, I'm in love.

47:11.600 --> 47:15.004
But then you always look stunning.

47:27.440 --> 47:30.081
Ah, my favourite.

47:37.040 --> 47:41.729
To... new beginnings.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.841
Now, that I will drink to.

47:48.520 --> 47:50.729
Remember the first time we
opened a bottle of this?

47:53.440 --> 47:56.605
We stayed up all night,
watched the sun come up.

47:57.680 --> 48:02.244
You said you could listen
to my voice forever.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.999
No, I probably said it felt like I'd
been listening to your voice forever.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.599
And, if I remember rightly,
you only ever talked about yourself.

48:09.600 --> 48:13.999
No, I don't believe that, baby kitten.
I'm sure you talked about me too.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.323
Oh, God... what am I doing here?

48:16.920 --> 48:18.651
Right.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.519
Come home.

48:21.520 --> 48:25.208
No, here. I'm getting
married in the morning.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.159
Sounds like you're trying
to convince yourself.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.369
No, I'm trying to get it
into your thick head.

48:31.120 --> 48:34.879
Fine, fine. You want to get
back at me. I understand that.

48:34.880 --> 48:38.399
But don't mess things up for yourself
and this poor kid in the process.

48:38.400 --> 48:41.119
Doug, believe it or not,
not everything is about you.

48:41.120 --> 48:45.439
Oh, please! You're only
doing this to punish me.

48:45.440 --> 48:48.759
No, I came here to find myself.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.650
And I did.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.561
In Raf.

48:54.440 --> 48:59.368
I'd like to find myself... in you.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.679
Oh, God...

49:01.680 --> 49:04.719
Come on, Mads. Five minutes
you've known this guy.

49:04.720 --> 49:08.679
Five weeks, and he's got to know me
better than you did in five years.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.279
Do you know why?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.959
You didn't let him do
that thing I wanted?

49:12.960 --> 49:15.679
Oh, you filthy little squirrel.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.719
- He listens to me.
- I listen to you.

49:17.720 --> 49:21.522
- Oh, please, you don't let me...
- I love listening to you.

49:23.520 --> 49:26.526
I... I love listening to...

49:27.360 --> 49:32.368
...those sweet little sighs
you make in your sleep.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.084
That crazy singing of
yours in the shower.

49:39.360 --> 49:43.919
That noise you made that
night at the George Cinq.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.005
I think the whole of
Paris heard that.

49:48.240 --> 49:52.088
It was a wonderful night.

49:52.600 --> 49:57.279
And this is... It's wonderful.

49:57.280 --> 49:59.719
This stuff you're
great at, the chase.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.691
It's the follow-through
that lets you down.

50:02.920 --> 50:06.608
And I wanted more, Doug.
I wanted marriage.

50:07.280 --> 50:10.319
We were perfect as we were.
Why spoil it?

50:10.320 --> 50:11.799
No, do you know what's perfect?

50:11.800 --> 50:15.487
We never have to have this conversation ever
again because I've found true happiness.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.679
That kid will never be
man enough for you.

50:18.680 --> 50:22.279
Raf is young, yeah,
but he's a grown-up.

50:22.280 --> 50:25.843
- You're not young, but you're a child.
- Thank you.

50:26.200 --> 50:30.241
No, that wasn't a... God,
you don't even want to grow up.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.239
- The thing about Peter Pan is...
- He can fly.

50:37.280 --> 50:40.331
He ends up alone.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.682
It's beautiful.

51:23.080 --> 51:29.639
<i>Close your eyes,
give me your hand, darling</i>

51:29.640 --> 51:36.039
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?</i>

51:36.040 --> 51:40.199
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>

51:40.200 --> 51:44.999
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

51:45.000 --> 51:51.839
<i>Is this burning an eternal flame?</i>

51:51.840 --> 51:58.639
<i>I believe it's meant to be, darling</i>

51:58.640 --> 52:05.319
<i>I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me</i>

52:05.320 --> 52:08.759
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>

52:08.760 --> 52:14.119
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

52:14.120 --> 52:21.159
<i>Or is this burning an eternal flame?</i>

52:21.160 --> 52:26.359
<i>Say my name, the sun
shines through the rain</i>

52:26.360 --> 52:34.121
<i>A whole life so lonely,
then you come and ease the pain</i>

52:34.520 --> 52:40.119
<i>I don't wanna lose this feeling</i>

52:40.120 --> 52:44.844
<i>Oh</i>

52:47.440 --> 52:53.999
<i>Close your eyes,
give me your hand, darling</i>

52:54.000 --> 53:00.399
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?</i>

53:00.400 --> 53:04.079
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>

53:04.080 --> 53:09.327
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

53:40.240 --> 53:46.719
<i>Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?</i>

53:46.720 --> 53:52.047
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

53:59.320 --> 54:01.639
I need to know.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.119
You can't be here.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.999
- Something happened back there.
- No!

54:05.000 --> 54:07.639
- Tell the truth.
- Truth about what?

54:07.640 --> 54:10.771
Surprise!

54:20.240 --> 54:22.130
Oh, God, it's him!

54:22.680 --> 54:25.731
He was the guy. She's the ex?

54:26.080 --> 54:27.759
Mads, I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

54:27.760 --> 54:31.721
- Yeah, but I-I... I can explain.
- Please, I can do this.

54:33.040 --> 54:36.039
He was the guy, a guy.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.079
And I didn't want to tell
you because it was nothing.

54:38.080 --> 54:41.359
But then you just kept going on at
me about how I never let anyone in

54:41.360 --> 54:44.764
and I started thinking,
"Did I make a terrible mistake?"

54:45.800 --> 54:49.639
And then we were on the beach, all covered
in tomatoes, and there was this sunset

54:49.640 --> 54:54.364
and suddenly it was three years ago
and I looked into his eyes and I knew...

54:59.440 --> 55:02.207
I don't feel anything for him.

55:03.400 --> 55:06.079
I never did.

55:06.080 --> 55:09.879
He's been desperate to tell you because
he doesn't want to keep secrets from you.

55:09.880 --> 55:15.079
But I didn't want you to know because
I didn't want to spoil everything and...

55:15.080 --> 55:18.959
...well, you always make such a
huge drama out of everything,

55:18.960 --> 55:22.728
which is why you two
are so perfect together.

55:23.280 --> 55:27.526
But now I'm the one who's ended up
making a huge drama out of nothing.

55:30.320 --> 55:33.719
I know I've been a
really shit sister.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.361
And I'm so, so sorry.

55:41.280 --> 55:43.648
Is this true?

55:47.440 --> 55:49.205
Yes.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.122
And do you still have
feelings for her?

55:55.160 --> 55:58.484
No, I feel absolutely
nothing for her.

56:08.560 --> 56:11.247
I'm so sorry.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.759
Hen night?

56:15.760 --> 56:18.719
As in girls only.

56:18.720 --> 56:23.762
As in we don't wanna see
you again until the church.

56:34.800 --> 56:37.123
I should probably just go.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.611
Yeah.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.159
Well, what are you waiting for?
It's my hen party already.

56:47.160 --> 56:50.245
You look like shit.
Go and get changed.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.679
Are you sure you want me there?

56:53.680 --> 56:58.319
Don't be stupid, T.
We all make mistakes.

56:58.320 --> 57:03.679
Oh, yes! And tonight I intend
to make a whole lot more.

57:20.080 --> 57:22.839
<i>I come home in the morning light</i>

57:22.840 --> 57:27.879
<i>My mother says, "When you
gonna live your life right?"</i>

57:27.880 --> 57:31.279
<i>Oh, Mummy dear,
we're not the fortunate ones</i>

57:31.280 --> 57:34.839
<i>And girls, they wanna have fun</i>

57:34.840 --> 57:39.643
<i>Oh, girls just wanna have fun</i>

57:45.920 --> 57:48.759
<i>The phone rings in the
middle of the night</i>

57:48.760 --> 57:53.639
<i>- Your father yells
- "What you gonna do with your life?"</i>

57:53.640 --> 57:57.119
<i>Oh, Daddy dear,
you know you're still number one</i>

57:57.120 --> 58:00.599
<i>But girls, they wanna have fun</i>

58:00.600 --> 58:03.239
<i>Oh, girls just wanna have</i>

58:03.240 --> 58:07.439
<i>That's all they really want</i>

58:07.440 --> 58:11.039
<i>Some fun</i>

58:11.040 --> 58:14.559
<i>When the working day is done</i>

58:14.560 --> 58:18.399
<i>Oh, girls, they wanna have fun</i>

58:18.400 --> 58:21.239
<i>Oh, girls just wanna have...</i>

58:21.240 --> 58:23.768
<i>Wild boys, wild boys</i>

58:25.200 --> 58:26.319
<i>Wild boys...</i>

58:26.320 --> 58:28.839
<i>Girls, they wanna</i>

58:28.840 --> 58:31.199
<i>Wanna have fun...</i>

58:31.200 --> 58:33.439
<i>Boys...</i>

58:33.440 --> 58:37.039
<i>Wanna have, girls, they wanna</i>

58:37.040 --> 58:39.599
<i>Wanna have fun</i>

58:39.600 --> 58:42.321
<i>Girls, wanna have</i>

58:58.280 --> 59:01.359
<i>Some boys take a beautiful girl</i>

59:01.360 --> 59:05.959
<i>And hide her away from
the rest of the world</i>

59:05.960 --> 59:10.039
<i>I wanna be the one
to walk in the sun</i>

59:10.040 --> 59:13.199
<i>Girls, they wanna have fun</i>

59:13.200 --> 59:16.239
<i>Oh, girls just wanna have</i>

59:16.240 --> 59:20.279
<i>That's all they really want</i>

59:20.280 --> 59:23.445
<i>Some fun</i>

59:23.960 --> 59:27.159
<i>When the working day is done</i>

59:27.160 --> 59:31.159
<i>Oh, girls, they wanna have fun</i>

59:31.160 --> 59:33.879
<i>Oh, girls just wanna have...</i>

59:33.880 --> 59:37.839
<i>Wild boys fallen far from glory</i>

59:37.840 --> 59:44.519
<i>Breathless sense of hunger,
on the razor's edge you trail</i>

59:44.520 --> 59:49.079
<i>Because there's
murder by the roadside</i>

59:49.080 --> 59:53.246
<i>In a sore, afraid new world</i>

59:54.320 --> 59:57.159
<i>They tried to break us</i>

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.119
<i>Looks like they'll try again</i>

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.919
<i>- Wild boys
- Wild boys</i>

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.079
<i>Never losing</i>

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.839
<i>- Wild boys
- Wild boys</i>

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.039
<i>Never chose this way</i>

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.799
<i>- Wild boys
- Wild boys</i>

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.639
<i>Never close your eyes</i>

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.965
<i>Wild boys always</i>

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.165
<i>Shine</i>

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.607
<i>Wild boys always shine</i>

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.323
- Hey! You all right?
- Yeah.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.126
- What's up, mate?
- Huh?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.684
Just can't wait for the
wedding to be over.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.679
Just wanna be married already.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.879
- You got a whole lifetime of that, fratello.
- I know.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.602
Enjoy your last night
of liberty, eh? Come on!

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.919
Do you, er...

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.130
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.679
About what?

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.209
Look... is this about Taylor?

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.439
I've got to ask...

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.679
- Have you still got feelings for her?
- No, that would be really stupid. No.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.570
Are you sure?

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.641
Yeah.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.483
Allora...

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.279
Can we duct-tape you
to a pole now, please?

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.806
- Yeah?
- In a minute.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.967
<i>It must have been love</i>

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.291
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.959
<i>Lay a whisper on my pillow</i>

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.162
<i>Leave the winter on the ground</i>

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:04.079
<i>I wake up lonely,
the stare of silence</i>

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.408
<i>In the bedroom, all around</i>

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:17.119
<i>Touch me now, I close my eyes</i>

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.161
<i>And dream away</i>

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:29.519
<i>It must have been love,
but it's over now</i>

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:36.119
<i>It must have been good,
but I lost it somehow</i>

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:42.359
<i>It must have been love,
but it's over now</i>

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:49.769
<i>From the moment we touched
till the time it ran out</i>

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.289
<i>Make-believing we're together</i>

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.719
<i>That I'm sheltered by your heart</i>

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:09.719
<i>But in and outside I turned to water</i>

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:16.319
<i>Like a teardrop in your palm</i>

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:23.279
<i>And it's a hard winter's day</i>

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.684
<i>I dream away</i>

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.679
<i>- It must have been love
- It must have been love</i>

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.879
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:41.799
<i>It was all that I wanted,
now I'm living without</i>

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.559
<i>- It must have been love
- It must have been love</i>

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.679
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.642
<i>It's where the water flows</i>

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.599
<i>It's where the wind blows...</i>

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.919
<i>- It must have been love
- It must have been love</i>

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.279
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:41.359
<i>It must have been good,
but I lost it somehow</i>

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.079
<i>- It must have been love
- It must have been love</i>

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.359
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:54.159
<i>From the moment we
touched till the time it ran out</i>

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.319
<i>- It must have been love
- It must have been love</i>

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.879
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:07.239
<i>It was all that I wanted,
now I'm living without</i>

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.359
<i>- It must have been love
- It must have been love</i>

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.959
<i>But it's over now</i>

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:19.321
<i>It's where the water flows</i>

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.086
<i>It's where the wind blows</i>

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.079
Oh...

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.239
You shouldn't be here.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.247
I'm not. You're dreaming.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.359
I'm getting married in the morning.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.003
And I couldn't be happier
for you, really.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.279
Really?

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.401
That's what I came to say.
You have my blessing.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:56.519
Oh... Doug, that's so sweet.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.799
Aah!

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.362
- No, no, no!
- What?

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.850
What, you think I've
come here for...?

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.611
Although...

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.642
...it is your last night
as a single woman.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.959
You could call this my...
wedding gift to you.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.125
Just get us a toaster!

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.481
Out!

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:45.399
<i>Well, I guess it would be nice
if I could touch your body</i>

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:50.279
<i>I know not everybody
has got a body like you</i>

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:55.439
<i>But I gotta think twice
before I give my heart away</i>

01:08:55.439 --> 01:09:00.198
<i>And I know all the games you play,
because I play them too</i>

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:06.279
<i>Oh, but I need some time
off from that emotion</i>

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:10.207
<i>Time to pick my heart
up off the floor</i>

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:16.078
<i>Oh, when that love comes
down without devotion</i>

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.519
<i>Well it takes a strong man, baby,
but I'm showing you the door</i>

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.684
<i>Cos I gotta have faith</i>

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.359
<i>I gotta have faith</i>

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.799
<i>Yes, I gotta have faith,
the faith, the faith</i>

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.879
<i>I gotta have faith,
the faith, the faith</i>

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.359
<i>Baby, I know you're
asking me to stay</i>

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.759
<i>Stay, please, please,
please, don't go away</i>

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.839
<i>You say I'm giving you the blues</i>

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.879
<i>Maybe you mean every word you say</i>

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.839
<i>Can't help but think of yesterday</i>

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.118
<i>And another who tied me
down to loverboy rules</i>

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.359
<i>Before this river becomes an ocean</i>

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.239
<i>Before you throw my
heart back on the floor</i>

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.039
<i>- Oh, baby, just reconsider
- Your foolish notion</i>

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.319
<i>Well, I need someone to hold me,
but I'll wait for something more</i>

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.799
<i>Yes, you gotta have faith</i>

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.279
<i>I gotta have faith</i>

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.919
<i>Yes, I gotta have faith,
the faith, the faith</i>

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.199
<i>I gotta have faith,
the faith, the faith...</i>

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.840
Ow!

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.279
<i>Before this river becomes an ocean</i>

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.279
<i>Before you throw my
heart back on the floor</i>

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:55.999
<i>Oh, baby, I'll reconsider
my foolish notion</i>

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.406
<i>Well, I need someone to hold me,
but I'll wait for something more</i>

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.239
<i>Guess I gotta have faith</i>

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.369
<i>I gotta have faith</i>

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.359
<i>Yes, I gotta have faith,
the faith, the faith</i>

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.047
<i>I gotta have faith,
the faith, the faith</i>

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.279
Last call for departure flight 2901 to
London, immediately boarding at Gate 3.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.079
This plane... Onward... Whoa!

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.165
Stop, stop.
Doors to manual, emergency.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.679
Hey...

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.923
Ciao, bello.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.410
You are in love with him.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.729
Oh, T...

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.239
I've made a... small fortune
writing books about love.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.399
I feel like I should have
some wisdom to impart.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.043
All I can think is 50
different ways to say orgasm.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:54.439
Everything I know about real love
I've learnt from you and Maddie.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.759
You know, you've got me
through some really tough times,

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.279
and I know you two have
had it tougher than most.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.839
But we've always got
through it together.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.083
We've always had each
other, haven't we?

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.519
When your mum died... Maddie told
me that what really broke her heart

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.244
was that your mum would
never be at your wedding day.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.923
You've done the hard part now.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.005
Don't you wanna be there for her?

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.482
Well, how long have we got?

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.639
Shit!

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.683
<i>Hey, little sister,
what have you done?</i>

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.250
<i>Hey, little sister,
who's the only one?</i>

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.399
<i>Hey, little sister,
who's your superman?</i>

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.559
<i>Hey, little sister,
who's the one you want?</i>

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.039
<i>Hey, little sister, shotgun</i>

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:46.447
<i>It's a nice day to start again</i>

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:53.130
<i>It's a nice day for a white wedding</i>

01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:00.199
<i>It's a nice day to start again</i>

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.366
<i>- Hey, little sister
- Who is it you're with?</i>

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.602
<i>- Hey, little sister
- What's your vice or wish?</i>

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.879
<i>- Hey, little sister, shotgun
- Oh, yeah</i>

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.039
<i>Hey, little sister,
who's your superman?</i>

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.204
<i>Hey, little sister, shot...</i>

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:29.679
<i>It's a nice day to start again</i>

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.721
<i>- It's a nice day for a...
- White wedding</i>

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:42.128
<i>It's a nice day to start again</i>

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:05.399
<i>It's a nice day to start again</i>

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:12.331
<i>It's a nice day for a white wedding</i>

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.728
<i>It's a nice day for a white wedding</i>

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.279
<i>It's a nice day for
a white wedding...</i>

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.402
Where have you been? Where's Raf?

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:51.079
<i>It's a nice day for a white wedding</i>

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:58.967
<i>It's a nice day to start again</i>

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.199
- Where have you been?
- It's my fault.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.039
She had to stop me from performing
an ill-advised aviation stunt,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.330
which is never a good idea after
12 sambucas and a minestrone.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.039
You look beautiful. Just one sec.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.401
You look beautiful.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.771
Taylor, am I making a
fool of myself again?

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.199
Raf's not like those other guys.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.410
He's a keeper. You done good.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.927
And what about you?
Are you... really OK with this?

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.607
Come on.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.285
Maddie.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.451
No matter what,
you've never given up on love.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.968
You followed your heart
wherever it leads.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.691
That's how I wanna be.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.367
Christ, don't make me cry now!

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.919
I know it's out there for you.

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.244
You just have to grab
it when you see it, OK?

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.199
- Oh, where's your dress?
- Sorry...

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.959
Er... it's not the only
thing that's missing.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.202
Er...

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.326
- My thong has gone!
- What?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.323
This is news?

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.959
Right. Are we ready?

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.919
Yeah.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.919
- OK.
- Yes.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.039
You all right, ragazzo.
You look a bit perduto.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.439
No, I'm fine.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.999
I was just running naked down the
street missing my own wedding

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.319
cos some idiot left me duct-taped
to a tree with a donkey.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.085
Ah, the donkey!

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.483
Please everyone be seated.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:17.279
Welcome everyone to the wedding
of Madison and Raffaele.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.439
Before we proceed,
I'm obliged to ask...

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:27.359
Does anyone know of any
just cause or impediment

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.240
why these two should not be wed?

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.444
Oh, sit down, Doug.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.450
- Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up.
- He has that effect on everyone.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.565
Let me ask again

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:54.368
if anyone knows a cause why
these two should not be wed.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.439
Well?

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.966
Wait.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.451
Raf...

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.285
Oh...

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.959
All my life I've gone from
wrong guy to wrong guy

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.601
and now, finally, to have
found a guy who's right...

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.209
...who's kind and decent and...

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.408
...beautiful inside and out.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.246
Because... you are the right guy.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.202
But it's not right.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.282
Not for me.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.159
I came here to find
myself and I found you.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.239
This is the same thing I always do:

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.519
running off into the arms
of a man and losing myself.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:55.879
Er... it's incredible to me that someone
as amazing as you wants to marry me.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.719
How could I not get
caught up in that?

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.600
The big church wedding, this...

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.483
It's everything I've ever dreamed of.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.690
Until now.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.522
I'm in love with love.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.168
But am I in love with you?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.563
I don't think that I am.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.967
I'm so sorry.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.644
You deserve to be
loved wholeheartedly.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.325
<i>If I could turn back time</i>

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.445
<i>If I could find a way...</i>

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:17.090
<i>I'd take back those
words that have hurt you</i>

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.322
<i>And you'd stay</i>

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.367
<i>I don't know why
I did the things I did</i>

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.322
<i>I don't know why
I said the things I said</i>

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.281
<i>Pride's like a knife,
it can cut deep inside</i>

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.999
<i>Words are like weapons,
they wound sometimes</i>

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.089
<i>I didn't really mean to hurt you</i>

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.239
<i>I didn't wanna let you go,
I know I made you cry</i>

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.441
<i>But, baby, if I could turn back time</i>

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:05.084
<i>If I could find a way</i>

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.439
<i>I'd take back those
words that have hurt you</i>

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.205
<i>And you'd stay</i>

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.839
<i>If I could reach the stars</i>

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.131
<i>I'd give them all to you</i>

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:29.645
<i>And you'd love me, love me,
like you used to do</i>

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.926
<i>If I could turn back time</i>

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.759
<i>If I could turn back time</i>

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.199
<i>My world was shattered
and I was torn apart</i>

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:46.839
<i>You took a knife and
drove it deep in my heart</i>

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.039
<i>You walked out that door,
I swore that I didn't care</i>

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:57.083
<i>But I'd lost everything,
darling, then and there</i>

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.606
<i>Too strong to tell you I was sorry</i>

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.919
<i>Too proud to tell you I was wrong,
I know that I was blind</i>

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:13.199
<i>And, darling, if I
could turn back time</i>

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.446
<i>If I could find a way</i>

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:22.559
<i>I'd take back those
words that have hurt you</i>

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.399
<i>And you'd stay</i>

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.724
<i>If I could reach the stars</i>

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.001
<i>I'd give them all to you</i>

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.319
<i>And you'd love me, love me,
like you used to do</i>

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.839
<i>If I could turn back time</i>

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.325
<i>If I could find a way</i>

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.159
<i>I'd take back those
words that have hurt you</i>

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.801
<i>And you'd stay</i>

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.039
<i>If I could turn back time...</i>

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.159
Turn back time.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.159
<i>If I could find a way...</i>

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.319
Find a way.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.879
<i>I'd take back those
words that have hurt you</i>

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.284
<i>And you'd stay</i>

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.919
<i>If I could reach the stars</i>

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.006
<i>I'd give them all to you</i>

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.439
<i>- And you'd love me
- I'd love you</i>

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.289
<i>Like I used to do</i>

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.319
<i>Turn back time...</i>

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.279
I love you.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.684
<i>Find a way</i>

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.721
<i>Aah-aah-aah-aah</i>

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.639
Ah, shake, shake, shake.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.724
Shake, shake, shake, shake.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.959
Amore.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.199
You don't have to pretend
to be pregnant anymore.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.159
- I'm a terrible liar.
- No, my love, you did great.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.085
No.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.450
I'm a terrible liar.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.167
Whoa!

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.079
- You're gonna be a papa'.
- But... no, wait, wait, wait!

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.643
Weddings, eh? Get everyone
going, don't they?

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.801
Do you, er... do you
fancy a cocktail?

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.039
No, I'll have a beer, thanks.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.842
Goes better with fish and chips.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.809
Mmm...

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.524
Are you gonna be all
right on your own?

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.199
I'm not on my own.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.844
I've got you... and the
best friends in the world.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.924
- Lady cuddle?
- Lady cuddle.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.249
- Oh...
- Ah! Oh, here we go.

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.239
The things you do to
keep me interested.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.359
Well, it worked.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.524
I don't wanna risk losing you again.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.919
You want to be Peter Pan.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.639
I can help you with that.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.959
What? Never grow up?

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.439
Fly!

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.959
Whoa!

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.491
- Bye!
- Later!

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.166
<i>Jitterbug</i>

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.119
<i>You put the boom-boom
into my heart</i>

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:48.599
<i>You send my soul sky high
when your loving starts</i>

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.159
<i>Jitterbug into my brain</i>

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.399
<i>Goes a bang-bang-bang
till my feet do the same</i>

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.319
<i>But something's bugging you,
something ain't right</i>

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.439
<i>My best friend told me
what you did last night</i>

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:03.279
<i>Left me sleeping in my bed</i>

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.159
<i>I was dreaming but I should
have been with you instead</i>

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.039
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.959
<i>Don't leave me hanging
on like a yo-yo</i>

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.799
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.039
<i>I don't wanna miss it
when you hit that high</i>

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.759
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.399
<i>Cos I'm not planning on going solo</i>

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.359
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:32.606
<i>Take me dancing tonight</i>

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.359
<i>I wanna hit that high</i>

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.639
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.319
<i>You take the grey
skies out of my way</i>

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.319
<i>You make the sun shine
brighter than Doris Day</i>

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.200
<i>Turned a bright spark into a flame</i>

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.599
<i>My beats per minute
never been the same</i>

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.439
<i>You're my lady, I'm your fool</i>

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:59.679
<i>It makes me crazy
when you act so cruel</i>

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.999
<i>Come on, baby, let's not fight</i>

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.359
<i>We'll go dancing,
everything will be all right</i>

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.159
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.319
<i>Don't leave me hanging
on like a yo-yo</i>

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.079
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.559
<i>I don't wanna miss it
when you hit that high</i>

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:21.039
<i>Wake me up before you go-go</i>

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.119

<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.959
<i>Cuddle up, baby, move in tight</i>

<i>We'll go dancing tomorrow night</i>

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.719
<i>It's cold out here,
but it's warm in bed</i>

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.763
<i>They can dance,
we'll stay home instead</i>

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.329
<i>Take me dancing tonight</i>

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.771

<i>Mmm, yeah</i>

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:44.921
<i>I used to think maybe you
loved me, now, baby, I'm sure</i>

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:53.203
<i>And I just can't wait till the
day when you knock on my door</i>

01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:02.526
<i>Now every time I go for the
mailbox, gotta hold myself down</i>

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:11.285
<i>Cos I just can't wait till you
write me you're coming around</i>

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.199
<i>I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh</i>

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.639

<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.239
<i>- Hey

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.325
<i>And don't it feel good?</i>

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.843
<i>I used to think maybe you
loved me, now I know that it's true</i>

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:49.807
<i>But I don't wanna spend my
whole life just awaiting for you</i>

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.318
<i>And I don't want
you back for the weekend</i>

01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.980
<i>- Not back for a day

back and I want you to stay"</i>
