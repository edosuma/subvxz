00:01.000 --> 00:02.005
Previously on the O.C.

00:02.005 --> 00:03.556
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

00:05.681 --> 00:05.715
- I think you might be pregnant.
- Meet my buddy, Frank.

00:05.716 --> 00:08.621
- He's going to put your books in order.
- Your so-called dating service--

00:08.622 --> 00:10.669
not exactly what Bullet
thought he was investing in.

00:10.670 --> 00:11.984
It's going to be different now.

00:11.985 --> 00:13.444
That's what you said
when Dad got arrested.

00:13.445 --> 00:15.371
I didn't know what I was doing
when I married your dad.

00:15.372 --> 00:17.522
- So why did you be here?
- For information.

00:17.707 --> 00:20.140
- I'm not who I say I am.
- And who are you?

00:20.173 --> 00:21.377
I'm Ryan's father.

00:21.377 --> 00:23.780
- Summer Roberts, will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:24.385 --> 00:25.492
I'm not pregnant.

00:25.499 --> 00:27.500
Saves us from having
to have a shotgun wedding.

00:27.507 --> 00:29.951
You and me and our normal wedding.

00:37.857 --> 00:38.683
Okay.

00:38.688 --> 00:42.060
So I woke up early this morning
to make my New Year's resolutions,

00:42.098 --> 00:43.521
but I think I need your help.

00:43.525 --> 00:45.002
- Okay.
- So number one,

00:45.047 --> 00:47.941
stop mooching off other people's
families, and get a job.

00:47.987 --> 00:50.360
Number two,
start taking calcium supplements.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.362
Do you think that's enough?

00:53.498 --> 00:55.293
Uh, how about number three?

00:56.898 --> 00:58.343
Plan Summer's wedding.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.072
But engaged? Oh, my God.

01:01.458 --> 01:02.992
Why didn't you say something sooner?

01:02.997 --> 01:04.843
- Denial.
- Hmm. How romantic.

01:05.257 --> 01:09.102
Look, someday I want to get married,
and I'm guessing that it will be to Seth.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.800
But now that I'm without child...

01:12.115 --> 01:15.861
Well, have you told Seth that?
'Cause getting married is kind of a big deal.

01:16.258 --> 01:16.970
I should know.

01:16.976 --> 01:18.913
Well, Taylor, I cannot break it off.

01:18.955 --> 01:20.943
You should have seen his face
when he asked me.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.163
He's never been
that sincere in his entire life.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.353
Usually everything he says is laced
with irony and contempt.

01:26.576 --> 01:27.770
But he meant it.

01:28.125 --> 01:28.812
So did I.

01:28.815 --> 01:31.240
Except you didn't, not really.

01:32.605 --> 01:35.051
Summer, you have to tell him how you really feel.

01:38.715 --> 01:39.950
Okay, great.

01:40.338 --> 01:41.782
I've always wanted to plan a wedding.

01:41.787 --> 01:45.320
I'm thinking bagpipes. Maybe
a replica of the Starship Enterprise.

01:52.715 --> 01:55.513
Hey. Why are you still in bed?
Are you sick or something?

01:55.638 --> 01:56.900
I am sick, Ryan.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.221
I'm sick of being engaged.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.313
So you asked her
before you looked at the test?

02:02.318 --> 02:06.080
I was trying to be a man,
a plan with a fundamental conceptual flaw.

02:06.115 --> 02:07.112
And now?

02:07.496 --> 02:09.539
Well, it's not that I regret it, exactly.

02:09.846 --> 02:11.850
Okay, that's exactly it: I regret it.

02:13.437 --> 02:17.532
Acting impulsively when your girlfriend
is pregnant, believe me, I know about that.

02:17.608 --> 02:19.940
But you can't ask Summer to marry you
if you don't want to get married.

02:19.948 --> 02:21.932
Well, I can't ask her
and then take it back.

02:21.946 --> 02:24.001
You should have seen the look
on her face; it'd crush her.

02:24.005 --> 02:26.770
All right, that's cool, that's cool.
Let's go call Sandy and Kirsten.

02:26.775 --> 02:28.590
- No.
- No, no. They might think you're too young,

02:28.598 --> 02:31.330
but I'm sure after we tell them
about the whole pregnancy scare,

02:31.336 --> 02:32.831
they'll totally get behind it.

02:43.416 --> 02:45.913
So just you know, Seth
doesn't want to get married.

02:46.255 --> 02:49.251
Well, it's not like Summer wants
to be a desperate housewife.

02:49.315 --> 02:52.441
- Right.
- Yeah, it's going to be easy then.

02:52.695 --> 02:55.481
All it will take is one of them to say
they think they should wait a while,

02:55.488 --> 02:58.131
and the other will happily agree,
and that'll be that.

02:58.928 --> 02:59.921
Yeah.

03:00.506 --> 03:02.703
- Except that it is Seth and Summer.
- Right.

03:03.167 --> 03:04.112
Oh, here they come.

03:04.115 --> 03:05.113
Okay.

03:06.415 --> 03:07.413
Hey.

03:08.416 --> 03:10.732
So Seth and I had a long talk.

03:11.737 --> 03:14.561
Ryan, I'd like you to be my best man.

03:15.415 --> 03:17.413
And I'd like you to be my maid of honor.

03:23.958 --> 03:25.922
- Well, I'd be honored.
- Yes, me, too.

03:25.968 --> 03:27.820
Super.  Let's go talk wedding stuff.

03:32.548 --> 03:33.991
I feel good about this.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.943
I think a little long-term lifelong
commitment is exactly what I needed.

03:39.808 --> 03:41.630
- This is bad.
- This is so bad.

<i>www.forom.com</i>

04:24.805 --> 04:26.251
Thanks for meeting me.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.360
Thanks for calling.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.382
So you're Ryan's father.

04:34.755 --> 04:38.051
That's funny, 'cause I was just going
to say the same thing to you.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.790
House drip? I ordered
a bone-dry cappuccino.

04:40.828 --> 04:42.132
This one's for you.

04:42.736 --> 04:45.182
I didn't know what to get Frank
and everyone likes the house drip.

04:45.188 --> 04:46.711
- Frank?
- Our new accountant.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.122
Did he go to Dubai with Bullet?

04:49.127 --> 04:52.522
Um, actually, Keeks, I was going
to talk to you about that.

04:53.135 --> 04:55.223
I know I've got a lot
of explaining to do, Sandy.

04:55.237 --> 04:57.190
Well, yeah, you can start with
what you're doing in Newport,

04:57.198 --> 04:59.700
using a fake name, working for my wife.

05:00.885 --> 05:02.082
I want to see Ryan.

05:03.167 --> 05:04.613
So ring our doorbell,

05:05.115 --> 05:06.123
introduce yourself.

05:06.128 --> 05:09.680
And have Ryan answer it?
I don't think he'd be thrilled to see me.

05:10.365 --> 05:12.542
So how did Frank Atwood
become our new accountant?

05:12.547 --> 05:15.041
He became friends with Bullet
while they were both locked up,

05:15.045 --> 05:18.221
and Bullet offered him a job. Frank saw
that he had holdings in Newport,

05:18.228 --> 05:20.221
saw your name
on the New Match portfolio.

05:20.597 --> 05:23.740
He found out from Social Services
that Ryan was living with you.

05:24.107 --> 05:27.553
I got to be honest, Frank, knowing
what I do about you, and your past,

05:29.885 --> 05:31.812
it's tough to root
for that family reunion.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.792
I only ask that you hear me out.

05:35.098 --> 05:36.922
He used to hit Dawn and the boys.

05:36.956 --> 05:38.453
How rehabilitated could he be?

05:38.458 --> 05:41.461
Well, he owned up to all that,
made no excuses.

05:41.496 --> 05:44.942
Apparently, the violence always started
after he'd been drinking,

05:45.397 --> 05:47.392
and he hasn't had a drop in eight years.

05:48.427 --> 05:52.081
He went to anger management, got his GED, took
some business classes by correspondence.

05:52.095 --> 05:54.091
I know about that;
I checked your record.

05:54.307 --> 05:57.373
You ever think maybe
the system works sometimes?

05:59.195 --> 06:00.193
Yeah.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.111
But how come you're reaching out
to Ryan only now?

06:05.496 --> 06:08.170
He only got out six weeks ago.
What was he supposed to do before that?

06:08.188 --> 06:09.853
Send a postcard from prison?

06:09.896 --> 06:12.240
"Great food. Love the view.
Wish you were here."

06:12.878 --> 06:15.073
Look, his entire family hated him.

06:16.746 --> 06:18.690
He's the first to admit he deserved it.

06:19.425 --> 06:21.070
So you think he's really changed?

06:23.038 --> 06:24.283
Yeah, I guess I do.

06:25.446 --> 06:29.472
I know it's on me to prove it to Ryan
and to you, that I'm a different guy.

06:30.347 --> 06:31.791
But I'd like the shot.

06:33.426 --> 06:37.423
With your blessing, of course,
and hopefully with your help.

06:47.696 --> 06:50.062
Of course you had a chance
to break it off, you just chickened out.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.872
- Summer had the same chance.
- Yeah, maybe she's a chicken, too.

06:52.877 --> 06:55.181
Summer Roberts is not a chicken.
She wants to get married.

06:55.186 --> 06:56.390
Yeah, you sure about that?

06:56.397 --> 06:58.253
Why,  did Taylor say that she doesn't?

06:58.286 --> 07:00.151
Will it hurt your feelings if I say yes?

07:00.157 --> 07:02.161
- No.
- Then yes. She says someday.

07:02.207 --> 07:04.682
But not now.
I said the exact same thing.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.100
All right, well, then tell her
you don't want to be engaged.

07:07.105 --> 07:08.231
She'll be fine with it.

07:08.235 --> 07:11.281
And spend the rest of my life living
down the fact that I left her at the altar?

07:11.288 --> 07:12.920
The  ring you gave her glows in the dark.

07:12.928 --> 07:14.771
I know; it's so cool.

07:14.815 --> 07:16.613
Yes, and I think she'll get over it.

07:16.808 --> 07:18.780
Yeah, she says she'll get over it,

07:18.827 --> 07:21.101
but what she means
is she'll get even, okay?

07:21.146 --> 07:24.730
Now, if she doesn't want to marry me,
she can tell me that herself.

07:24.776 --> 07:25.770
Hmm, good point.

07:25.773 --> 07:26.487
Really?

07:26.487 --> 07:29.330
No, but if you're too chicken
to tell Summer how you feel,

07:29.625 --> 07:32.022
give her no choice but
to tell you how she feels.

07:32.929 --> 07:34.122
Smoke her out.

07:37.086 --> 07:38.081
Chicken.

07:41.946 --> 07:45.752
As a dog, Buck has the opportunity to view man
when he doesn't even know he's being watched.

07:45.765 --> 07:49.711
Personally, I think all books should be
written from the point of view of a dog.

07:49.925 --> 07:50.780
But seriously,

07:50.787 --> 07:52.463
seeing the world through
the eyes of an animal,

07:52.468 --> 07:55.222
forces us to see the world
and ourselves in a new light.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.460
Thank you.

07:56.488 --> 07:57.930
That was excellent, Will.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.251
For a new student,
you're really catching up nicely.

08:00.258 --> 08:01.450
Kaitlin, you're up.

08:03.725 --> 08:04.712
Thanks for the nap.

08:04.715 --> 08:06.461
I really needed to be put to sleep.

08:06.727 --> 08:08.322
She's not really going to do it.

08:08.597 --> 08:09.592
Yeah, she is.

08:09.598 --> 08:12.002
We're supposed to talk
bout the book like Buck would.

08:12.005 --> 08:14.042
And, well, Buck is a dog.

08:14.387 --> 08:16.181
So, I think that Buck would say...

08:16.526 --> 08:18.410
Ruff, ruff, ruff.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.882
Okay, Kaitlin, that's enough.
You can sit.

08:27.927 --> 08:29.941
But the assignment was 500 words.

08:29.975 --> 08:32.611
- I'm not done yet.
- "Ruff, ruff, ruff." Think we got it.

08:32.616 --> 08:33.611
Okay.

08:34.686 --> 08:35.912
See you all tomorrow.

08:35.917 --> 08:38.352
Kaitlin... you I'll see right now.

08:44.536 --> 08:45.672
You think this is funny?

08:45.675 --> 08:46.672
Kind of.

08:47.487 --> 08:51.152
- I mean, it was original at least.
- Well, I'll give you an A for originality.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.213
- Cool.
- But your presentation gets an F.

08:53.886 --> 08:55.643
You're failing English.

08:55.677 --> 08:57.670
You think being held back is funny, too?

08:57.987 --> 09:00.581
An extra year in high school
is definitely not funny.

09:01.347 --> 09:02.622
Sorry, I forgot my books.

09:02.628 --> 09:05.490
Will, you seem to have
a real handle on public speaking.

09:05.525 --> 09:08.550
Would you mind helping Kaiin
with a revised presentation?

09:08.585 --> 09:10.371
- Well, you know, I...
- Great.

09:11.136 --> 09:12.582
One more shot, Kaitlin.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.191
And every word better be different.

09:22.808 --> 09:24.012
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:24.047 --> 09:26.333
No shrimp tacos today; we got fish.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.523
- You like tilapia?
- Oh, I love the tilapia,

09:28.528 --> 09:31.242
but I'm actually not hungry.
Thanks, though.

09:32.017 --> 09:33.211
What's up?

09:34.356 --> 09:35.950
Are you on a break anytime soon?

09:40.285 --> 09:41.731
You talked to him today?

09:42.038 --> 09:43.390
We met, yeah.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.061
Always knew one day he'd be out.

09:51.807 --> 09:53.001
Well, he's out.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.833
Yeah, yeah. It's... weird.

09:59.146 --> 10:01.993
And I know I'm supposed
to have a lot of questions, but...

10:02.546 --> 10:05.691
it's like my dad's from another life
it's so far in the past.

10:05.727 --> 10:09.030
Well, if that's how you want
to keep it, that's fine with me.

10:09.265 --> 10:11.391
No speech about
the importance of family?

10:13.405 --> 10:14.603
You're my family.

10:19.517 --> 10:21.010
What's important to me is you.

10:27.225 --> 10:28.673
I don't want to see him.

10:31.406 --> 10:32.853
Maybe later, not now.

10:37.656 --> 10:38.892
Then that's what I'll tell him.

10:38.896 --> 10:39.890
Yeah.

10:42.088 --> 10:43.531
And no need to explain.

10:44.468 --> 10:45.460
Thanks.

10:45.698 --> 10:47.140
So I'll see you at home.

10:51.297 --> 10:52.741
Sandy, how'd he seem?

10:54.008 --> 10:55.200
He seemed good.

10:56.427 --> 10:57.420
Good.

11:21.545 --> 11:22.141
Hello.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.801
Frank, Sandy Cohen here.

11:23.837 --> 11:27.341
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hey, listen, I spoke to Ryan, and, uh,

11:28.215 --> 11:30.311
I'm sorry, but he does not
want to see you.

11:34.116 --> 11:36.133
Not even a half hour for a cup of coffee?

11:36.135 --> 11:37.331
No. Not now.

11:37.848 --> 11:39.070
I'm sorry, Frank.

11:41.776 --> 11:43.041
Best of luck to you.

11:43.047 --> 11:45.391
Yeah, um, thanks for trying.

11:48.887 --> 11:50.083
Ryan said no?

11:54.457 --> 11:55.903
What are you gonna do?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.421
A cookbook? I thought you
got me a present.

12:02.427 --> 12:06.371
That's just the first part of it. I also
signed you up for some cooking classes.

12:06.388 --> 12:09.160
- Here you go.
- But... I don't even like cooking.

12:09.197 --> 12:11.523
Well, that's just something,
I guess, you better work on,

12:11.525 --> 12:14.663
if we're gonna get married,
since I pect a nice, home-cooked meal

12:14.665 --> 12:16.283
on the table every day by 5:00.

12:16.995 --> 12:18.233
Since when? Your mother never cooked.

12:18.236 --> 12:21.362
Since I decided to get a wife of my own.
I also brought over the Torah.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.450
You're converting to Judaism. Yes?

12:24.235 --> 12:26.030
He's totally trying to smoke me out.

12:26.348 --> 12:29.422
He wants me to break off the engagement
so he can live a long, guilt-free life

12:29.427 --> 12:30.911
being a big, fat victim.

12:31.516 --> 12:33.171
It is sneaky, cowardly
and passive-aggressive.

12:33.177 --> 12:35.122
And you wish you'd thought of it first?

12:35.846 --> 12:36.022
Totally.

12:36.038 --> 12:38.612
So what are you gonna do,
level with him and tell him the truth?

12:38.615 --> 12:40.772
Crack that. He wants a game
of chicken? He's gonna get it.

12:40.777 --> 12:42.371
I'm going bridezilla on his ass.

12:46.717 --> 12:49.090
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Sandy.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.933
I didn't know you were in a meeting.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.722
Are you okay? What happened?

12:53.768 --> 12:54.963
We need to talk.

12:58.328 --> 12:59.770
What are you doing here?

13:00.307 --> 13:01.130
Frank's not leaving.

13:01.137 --> 13:04.232
Well, I'm sorry, but I spoke to Ryan,
and that's what he wants.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.972
There's  something I didn't tell
you when we spoke.

13:08.006 --> 13:10.250
I was hoping I wouldn't
need to mention it.

13:11.588 --> 13:13.412
But then I was saying
good-bye to the ladies,

13:13.425 --> 13:15.442
and it just came out.

13:23.206 --> 13:26.000
Sandy, Frank is dying.

13:33.617 --> 13:35.633
I felt terrible at dinner last night,

13:36.248 --> 13:37.690
not saying anything to Ryan.

13:38.048 --> 13:39.030
Well, you shouldn't.

13:39.037 --> 13:41.640
Did he mention Frank?
Did he seem remotely ous at all?

13:41.648 --> 13:43.790
Well, he's Ryan. I'm sure
he's full of questions.

13:43.795 --> 13:44.933
He's just sitting on them.

13:44.937 --> 13:46.613
You know, I asked him point-blank,

13:46.618 --> 13:49.020
and he said he did not want to see him.

13:49.305 --> 13:50.751
He doesn't know he's sick.

13:51.668 --> 13:52.472
If he's sick.

13:52.478 --> 13:54.072
You think Frank's lying
about having cancer?

13:54.076 --> 13:56.422
Well, yeah, he's not the most
trustworthy guy I've ever met.

13:56.426 --> 13:57.622
Yeah, he'd lie about that.

13:57.626 --> 14:00.882
He smoked two packs of cigarettes
a day since he was 14 years old.

14:00.915 --> 14:03.523
It would be weird
if he didn't have lung cancer.

14:04.245 --> 14:05.882
I appreciate you being cautious,

14:05.918 --> 14:07.280
but this seems personal.

14:07.288 --> 14:08.482
It  is personal.

14:08.568 --> 14:09.762
Ryan is our son.

14:10.128 --> 14:12.482
Because Frank turned his back on his family.

14:12.758 --> 14:14.282
He has hurt Ryan before.

14:16.407 --> 14:17.660
I'm not gonna let him do it again.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.113
But what if he's not lying?

14:19.138 --> 14:19.543
Please.

14:19.545 --> 14:22.791
What if Ryan finds out that we knew
the truth and didn't tell him?

14:25.275 --> 14:26.890
Just let me talk to him, please.

14:32.356 --> 14:33.550
Shalom, Cohen.

14:34.885 --> 14:36.642
Well, since you brought
me presents yesterday,

14:38.005 --> 14:39.371
Oh, that is sweet.

14:39.408 --> 14:40.132
Yeah.

14:40.138 --> 14:42.671
So here's information on the four "C"s:

14:43.507 --> 14:45.480
carat, clarity, color and cut.

14:45.527 --> 14:47.283
Ah, diamonds.

14:48.666 --> 14:49.602
Sure, sure.

14:49.605 --> 14:52.353
Well, if we're really doing this,
we better do it right.

14:52.355 --> 14:53.293
Exactly.

14:53.296 --> 14:54.850
Which means nothing less
than two carats.

14:54.856 --> 14:55.793
Why not three?

14:55.796 --> 14:56.990
You're worth it.

14:57.828 --> 14:59.420
Oh, there's just one more thing.

15:01.085 --> 15:01.761
Pancakes?

15:01.766 --> 15:02.760
Pancakes.

15:03.038 --> 15:05.022
I thought he should live
with you for a little while.

15:05.026 --> 15:08.230
You know, I just need to make sure my husband
can take care of something small and vulnerable.

15:08.236 --> 15:11.632
Sure, sure, I've been meaning to spend
a little one-on-one time with the little guy.

15:11.636 --> 15:12.903
Oh, and I've been thinking,

15:12.907 --> 15:14.892
uh, Yates or maybe Shelley.

15:15.335 --> 15:16.443
You're working on the guest list?

15:16.447 --> 15:17.803
Those are poets, Summer,

15:17.806 --> 15:20.842
and their words will inspire my vows.

15:21.025 --> 15:22.572
Have you been working on yours?

15:23.847 --> 15:25.702
Why, yes. I was thinking of

15:25.736 --> 15:28.502
Shel Silverstein
with a dash of Dr. Seuss.

15:28.847 --> 15:30.412
"I meant what I said,
I said what I meant,

15:30.415 --> 15:32.181
an elephant's faithful
a hundred percent."

15:32.185 --> 15:33.802
- Very moving, Summer.
- I know.

15:34.636 --> 15:35.632
Okay.

15:39.496 --> 15:40.991
We sort of had a dog once.

15:48.495 --> 15:49.693
Hey, band geek.

15:52.496 --> 15:54.652
Sorry, I meant that band geek.

15:56.408 --> 15:58.290
So Miss Tidy says that you're my tutor.

15:58.307 --> 15:59.381
That's what she says.

15:59.387 --> 16:00.981
And you never disobey Miss Tidy?

16:01.726 --> 16:02.773
Let's just get this over with.

16:02.776 --> 16:05.513
Actually, I was wondering
if you could just

16:05.545 --> 16:07.891
write something down
and give it to me tomorrow.

16:08.407 --> 16:10.763
Well, I'm not like the other guys
at this school.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.212
I don't play water polo,
and I really don't listen to you.

16:13.217 --> 16:14.703
Look, little drummer boy,

16:15.316 --> 16:18.152
Miss Tidy said that you had
to help me with my assignment.

16:18.156 --> 16:19.950
If I fail, you fail.

16:21.446 --> 16:22.842
You can do this yourself, you know.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.353
You're not as stupid as you want to be.

16:24.356 --> 16:26.013
Stupid has nothing to do with it.

16:28.516 --> 16:29.960
See you before class.

16:37.048 --> 16:38.700
I didn't know you were coming by.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.692
Oh, well, I knew
you'd be at court all morning,

16:40.698 --> 16:43.343
and doing all that good can
work up quite an appetite.

16:43.346 --> 16:44.540
You're telling me.

16:45.188 --> 16:46.990
Roast beef is rare,
and the mustard is spicy.

16:46.997 --> 16:51.193
Then I'm a happy man, but I'm guessing a picnic
isn't the only reason you stopped by.

16:52.116 --> 16:54.163
Aw, Sandy, I don't want
to fight with you.

16:54.998 --> 16:57.690
We both love Ryan and we both
want what's best for him.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.191
Sometimes we're just
not gonna see eye to eye.

17:00.198 --> 17:03.742
No, and our yin-yang style of parenting
hasroduced two pretty good kids,

17:03.767 --> 17:04.963
so why stop now?

17:05.676 --> 17:06.940
Does that mean everything is okay?

17:06.944 --> 17:08.540
I know you want to talk to Ryan.

17:09.185 --> 17:10.382
I respect that.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.132
But you should know I called
Dr. Alessi at the prison.

17:14.347 --> 17:16.303
I asked him to look into
Frank Atwood's medical records.

17:16.308 --> 17:18.191
Sandy, that's an invasion of privacy.

17:18.228 --> 17:19.423
Yin and yang, baby.

17:19.746 --> 17:22.193
If I'm wrong, I'll eat my words,
but if I'm right,

17:22.965 --> 17:24.512
the sooner we know, the better.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.720
Does that mean I'm the yang?

17:27.737 --> 17:28.733
Maybe.

17:30.597 --> 17:31.792
See you tomorrow.

17:33.995 --> 17:35.002
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:35.006 --> 17:36.450
What  do you want to do?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.150
Maybe get some Mexican food?

17:39.347 --> 17:41.141
That is the last thing
I want to do ever again.

17:41.145 --> 17:42.591
Occupational hazard.

17:43.036 --> 17:44.822
Actually, I have
to stop by Kirsten's office.

17:44.906 --> 17:46.523
She said she wanted to talk to me.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.342
Do you think it's about your father?

17:48.348 --> 17:50.031
Uh, well, I hope not.

17:50.065 --> 17:52.160
I made it very clear
I don't want to see him.

17:52.175 --> 17:53.173
Right.

17:53.395 --> 17:54.483
Which I totally support.

17:54.488 --> 17:55.931
Mmm, you just don't agree.

17:56.195 --> 17:57.392
Well, it's none of my business.

17:57.397 --> 17:59.191
Ah, that's never stopped you before.

18:00.096 --> 18:02.653
Look, all I know is that
if my father wanted to see me,

18:02.656 --> 18:04.600
even if he was a lying,

18:04.645 --> 18:08.413
violent, drunken card shark o holds up
liquor store with a sawed-off shotgun...

18:08.415 --> 18:10.311
My mother's a card shark,
but whatever.

18:10.786 --> 18:12.280
I would still want to see him.

18:13.128 --> 18:15.720
If only to get whatever
feelings I had off my chest--

18:15.728 --> 18:19.472
to tell him that I think he's a total as
and I never want to see him again.

18:20.347 --> 18:22.162
That would feel good.

18:23.918 --> 18:27.090
Ryan, my dad lives in San Diego
with his new family.

18:27.545 --> 18:30.732
He comes to Newport once a quarter
to check on his car dealership

18:30.735 --> 18:32.261
and play around at Big Canyon.

18:34.968 --> 18:38.860
I haven't even spent more than 20 minutes
with him since I was in second grade.

18:41.017 --> 18:42.212
It's just...

18:42.987 --> 18:45.122
really easy to ignore your kids,

18:45.798 --> 18:48.290
and the hard part is trying
to have a relationship.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.831
Look, I'm sure everything
you're saying is right,

18:50.835 --> 18:52.250
but you don't know my father.

18:52.258 --> 18:54.381
You haven't seen him
since you were a little kid.

18:54.386 --> 18:56.782
No offense, but you don't
really know him either.

18:58.156 --> 18:59.153
Alef.

19:01.746 --> 19:02.742
Bet.

19:06.086 --> 19:07.080
Gimmel.

19:07.196 --> 19:08.642
- It says Dalet.
- Damn it.

19:10.898 --> 19:12.411
Oh, my brisket is burning.

19:14.066 --> 19:15.011
I like it chewy.

19:15.017 --> 19:18.810
Julie, I really appreciate you helping me
and filling in for Rabbi Gutterman,

19:19.997 --> 19:21.440
but this just is not working.

19:21.565 --> 19:25.121
Right, and whenever you want
to let me know what this is,

19:25.166 --> 19:26.362
I'm all ears.

19:26.417 --> 19:29.443
As much as I've enjoyed learning
the Hebrew alphabet with you.

19:29.457 --> 19:31.741
Well, this is a ridiculous sham.

19:31.788 --> 19:34.451
I mean, not that I don't look forward
to one day becoming Jewish.

19:34.466 --> 19:35.933
Did Seth dare you to do this?

19:36.285 --> 19:37.623
Um, in a way, yes.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.863
We're engaged.

19:40.415 --> 19:41.883
Oh, that's great!

19:43.547 --> 19:44.462
I think.

19:44.468 --> 19:45.503
You're young,

19:45.505 --> 19:46.863
but, hey, worked for me.

19:46.865 --> 19:49.460
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, no, but Summer, did...

19:49.847 --> 19:51.042
Are you...?

19:51.155 --> 19:53.243
No, no... we thought that I might be.

19:54.117 --> 19:55.761
Then why are you getting married?

19:56.275 --> 19:57.470
Because he asked me, and I said yes.

19:57.475 --> 20:01.520
And now you don't want to call it off
because you don't want to hurt his feelings.

20:02.438 --> 20:05.051
Or 'cause if you do,
he'll get the upper hand.

20:05.397 --> 20:06.013
Exactly.

20:06.028 --> 20:08.022
Now we're talking
my kind of dating game.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.080
Manipulating the opposite sex.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.702
God, Julie, why didn't I come
to you earlier?

20:11.708 --> 20:12.743
Thank you, Summer.

20:12.747 --> 20:15.242
Look, if you want to take him down,
you have to kick it up a notch.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.692
It's called chutzpah.

20:16.765 --> 20:18.622
I think it's chutz... chutzpah.

20:18.937 --> 20:19.932
Chutzpah.

20:21.175 --> 20:23.123
Okay, never mind.
What are you thinking?

20:24.615 --> 20:27.763
After I talked to Sandy,
I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

20:28.066 --> 20:29.860
I'm sorry he was so abrupt with you.

20:30.845 --> 20:31.992
Can't say I blame him.

20:31.995 --> 20:33.810
He's really protective of Ryan.

20:34.498 --> 20:35.690
But we talked.

20:35.876 --> 20:37.070
And, well,

20:37.985 --> 20:40.083
there's someone here
who wants to meet you.

20:59.028 --> 21:00.780
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.813
Want to grab some coffee?

21:12.728 --> 21:14.380
It was fine.

21:15.067 --> 21:18.061
You haven't seen your father
in eight years, and it was fine?

21:18.135 --> 21:20.203
Yeah, well, fine is not a total disaster.

21:20.248 --> 21:21.442
I'll take fine.

21:21.508 --> 21:22.770
What'd you guys talk about?

21:22.776 --> 21:26.602
Politics, movies? His Netflix queue
must have been jam-packed.

21:26.648 --> 21:28.851
Has he seen Titanic?

21:28.896 --> 21:30.550
I don't know. We just kind of talked.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.470
I mean, I don't know.

21:32.517 --> 21:37.411
I must have thought hundreds of times about
what I would say to my dad when I saw him again, but...

21:38.548 --> 21:41.823
sitting in the diner, I just didn't want
to say any of those things.

21:41.825 --> 21:43.293
Oh, because he's sick?

21:43.325 --> 21:45.903
Because he's normal.
Look, you can meet him tonight.

21:46.146 --> 21:47.952
See for yourself.
He's coming over for dinner.

21:47.956 --> 21:50.782
I would, but Summer and I have
a date to build our chuppah together,

21:50.786 --> 21:52.462
but maybe if we get done early.

21:52.495 --> 21:54.563
You know, you can stop
that crazy train anytime you want.

21:54.578 --> 21:57.052
Yeah, I love her enough
to ask her to marry me.

21:57.097 --> 21:58.580
I am not gonna lose her.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.800
Uh, you mean you don't
want to lose to her.

22:00.837 --> 22:03.983
Exactly. Plus, the little guy is kind of
starting to grow on me.

22:04.648 --> 22:06.092
Ain't that right, Pancakes?

22:06.847 --> 22:07.843
Oh, hi!

22:08.435 --> 22:09.041
Hi!

22:09.047 --> 22:10.540
Dude, you can't bring an animal in here.

22:10.545 --> 22:11.742
What are you doing?

22:11.815 --> 22:13.511
How dare you talk
to your nephew that way.

22:13.516 --> 22:15.660
Don't listen to mean
Uncle Ryan, Pancakes.

22:15.698 --> 22:17.140
That's just the 'roids talking.

22:17.147 --> 22:18.660
They do make him huge, I know.

22:18.706 --> 22:22.303
Would you get him out of here,
please, before he ends up in a quesadilla?

22:23.476 --> 22:24.510
We'll be on the patio.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.702
Please bring us another side of carrots.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.811
You got my speech?

22:41.057 --> 22:42.051
Here.

22:42.177 --> 22:43.623
I knew you'd come through.

22:46.678 --> 22:48.371
You asked him to do your homework?

22:48.528 --> 22:49.422
Yeah, what about us?

22:49.428 --> 22:50.592
I'm sorry, guys.

22:50.607 --> 22:51.530
You've been replaced.

22:51.535 --> 22:52.743
Dude, I feel so betrayed.

22:52.745 --> 22:53.741
Me, too.

22:54.195 --> 22:56.253
Kaitlin, you ready
to start us off today?

22:56.297 --> 22:57.281
Yes, Ms. Tidy.

22:57.285 --> 22:59.733
- This better be good.
- Oh, I worked really hard.

23:10.148 --> 23:11.482
We're ready when you are, Kaitlin.

23:11.487 --> 23:14.493
Ms. Tidy, there's been
some kind of a mix-up.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.733
And Will here, he...

23:16.765 --> 23:18.361
No excuses, Kaitlin, let's go.

23:25.715 --> 23:27.210
Buck is, like,

23:28.056 --> 23:34.690
this spoiled and pampered dog who lives
a sweet life in a big house in California.

23:35.185 --> 23:37.243
And also, he's got really pretty hair.

23:41.268 --> 23:42.661
Then, one day,

23:42.695 --> 23:43.891
like the book says,

23:44.317 --> 23:46.580
the facts of life take a fiercer aspect,

23:46.626 --> 23:48.991
and then things just
kind of start to suck.

23:49.035 --> 23:52.261
Buck goes through so much crap
that he goes to live with some wolves,

23:52.268 --> 23:56.010
and he'd rather kill for his own food
than talk to other people.

23:56.046 --> 23:57.440
I mean, not talk to other people,

23:57.446 --> 23:59.310
because he's a dog,
and he doesn't...

24:00.287 --> 24:01.481
You guys know that.

24:03.627 --> 24:04.823
I think that...

24:05.816 --> 24:08.080
that Buck's story is
kind of like a metaphor.

24:09.545 --> 24:11.461
A metaphor for being a teenager.

24:12.435 --> 24:13.631
Just like...

24:14.216 --> 24:15.743
the more crap you go through,

24:17.078 --> 24:18.972
the more you kind of want to be alone.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.973
Dude, she's pretty deep.

24:22.188 --> 24:23.203
Shut up, dude.

24:23.207 --> 24:24.650
I'm trying to listen.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.200
Fish?

24:27.406 --> 24:28.580
Are you sure about that?

24:28.585 --> 24:30.602
What's wrong with fish, Taylor?
Everyone likes fish.

24:30.606 --> 24:34.971
Well, what if Ryan's dad was
a fisherman on choppy seas,

24:35.007 --> 24:37.223
and the smell of fish brings
back bad memories?

24:37.227 --> 24:40.291
Chino is inland, and Frank
was a mechanic-- cars, not boats.

24:43.035 --> 24:44.232
Okay, then.

24:45.456 --> 24:48.552
Wait. What is the FDA's
official position on the spinach recall?

24:48.566 --> 24:50.300
Spinach has a clean bill of health.

24:50.308 --> 24:51.690
I don't think we should take any chances.

24:51.695 --> 24:53.663
I'm gonna go to the store and get some broccoli.

24:53.665 --> 24:54.663
Taylor...

24:55.237 --> 24:55.971
what's wrong?

24:55.976 --> 24:58.170
Even for you, you're acting
a little strange.

24:59.558 --> 25:01.811
Yeah, I know.
I'm just really nervous.

25:02.717 --> 25:04.001
I'm meeting Ryan's dad.

25:04.006 --> 25:06.100
The guy hasn't seen
a woman in eight years.

25:06.516 --> 25:07.512
I think he'll like you.

25:07.517 --> 25:09.791
Well, it's not about that.
I mean, of course he's gonna like me.

25:09.795 --> 25:13.102
It's just, my first real Ryan situation.

25:13.256 --> 25:16.322
Everything else has been all
French husbands and slutty aliens.

25:16.327 --> 25:17.000
Excuse me?

25:17.008 --> 25:20.200
It's like the first major test
of our relationship, and I just...

25:21.927 --> 25:25.471
I really want him to see that I can be
there for the serious stuff, too.

25:25.615 --> 25:28.183
The fact that you're there
for him means everything.

25:30.376 --> 25:31.582
Thanks, Keeks.

25:32.257 --> 25:34.300
You could make such
a great mother-in-law.

25:35.456 --> 25:37.530
What's going on here?
We having some kind of feast?

25:37.538 --> 25:39.703
Frank's been eating prison food
for almost a decade.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.803
The least we can do
is grill him some fish.

25:41.848 --> 25:44.391
If he likes fish.
Do you think he's gonna like fish?

25:45.297 --> 25:46.741
You invited Frank to dinner?

25:47.225 --> 25:48.852
No, Ryan did.

25:59.126 --> 26:01.991
Sandy, I told you
that I was gonna talk to him.

26:02.037 --> 26:03.693
He just wants to see his father.

26:03.735 --> 26:07.330
Well, now we all get to see him
at the delightful extended family dinner.

26:07.778 --> 26:10.220
Have you heard back
from the doctor at the prison?

26:10.257 --> 26:11.691
No. Not yet.

26:11.728 --> 26:13.251
Well, I guess we just
make the best of it.

26:13.255 --> 26:14.451
We always do.

26:14.697 --> 26:17.751
With Dawn, with Trey-- I think we've been
very open with Ryan's family.

26:17.766 --> 26:18.960
Until now?

26:23.786 --> 26:25.530
Ryan's been through hell this year.

26:26.966 --> 26:28.770
And there is just
something about this guy...

26:28.777 --> 26:30.273
That he's not a total screwup?

26:31.095 --> 26:32.291
Look, I get it.

26:33.005 --> 26:35.993
We all imagined that Ryan's father
would be some kind of monster.

26:35.998 --> 26:39.211
And then he shows up, and he's smart,
and he's funny, and he's nice.

26:39.218 --> 26:41.942
Yeah, minus his record for
spousal abuse and armed robbery,

26:41.945 --> 26:44.291
the guy's a real prize.
Move over, Bachelor Bob.

26:45.285 --> 26:49.771
Sandy, your relationship
with Ryan is your relationship.

26:52.545 --> 26:54.012
Nothing's gonna change that.

26:55.378 --> 26:56.570
Well, I know that.

26:57.745 --> 26:59.293
And I know this is important to Ryan.

26:59.295 --> 27:00.303
So important.

27:00.307 --> 27:01.243
All right.

27:01.255 --> 27:03.723
Let me change. I'll fire up the grill.

27:04.076 --> 27:07.753
I'll put a smile on my face and conjure up
some embarrassing stories about the family.

27:07.756 --> 27:08.950
Thank you.

27:15.738 --> 27:16.180
Hey.

27:16.186 --> 27:17.733
Hi. Is everything okay?

27:17.777 --> 27:20.373
When you called, you made it
sound like an emergency.

27:20.755 --> 27:22.431
It sort of is.

27:24.515 --> 27:25.961
Jacket or no jacket?

27:27.278 --> 27:29.070
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

27:30.188 --> 27:32.940
In case you can't tell,
I really want this to go well.

27:32.987 --> 27:35.330
Just relax, be yourself,
everyone will love you.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.050
Thanks. Sound pretty sure about that.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.051
Well, we've all done things
we're not proud of, Frank,

27:41.355 --> 27:42.551
but people change.

27:42.598 --> 27:44.290
Ryan knows that, so do the Cohens.

27:44.336 --> 27:45.862
No, I know, it's just...

27:45.895 --> 27:47.741
Hey, you'll be fine, Frank.

27:50.316 --> 27:51.762
It will all be fine.

27:54.068 --> 27:55.060
Right.

27:56.537 --> 27:59.281
But maybe I'll bring the jacket,
you know, just in case.

27:59.988 --> 28:01.180
Good luck.

28:02.627 --> 28:03.231
Call me.

28:03.236 --> 28:04.681
Let me know how it goes.

28:05.007 --> 28:06.001
Yeah.

28:08.508 --> 28:09.502
Julie...

28:13.506 --> 28:14.700
Thank you.

28:30.976 --> 28:31.972
Cohen.

28:32.505 --> 28:33.703
Pancakes.

28:33.747 --> 28:35.923
Hey, you ready for some
chuppah construction,

28:35.928 --> 28:40.420
or you just want to take it easy and maybe
brainstorm some ideas for the centerpiece?

28:41.648 --> 28:43.191
Actually, I've changed my mind.

28:43.526 --> 28:44.522
You have?

28:44.816 --> 28:45.812
Yes.

28:45.878 --> 28:48.652
I don't want some big,
formal wedding extravaganza.

28:49.957 --> 28:51.401
I want something smaller.

28:52.617 --> 28:53.813
Great, great.

28:53.845 --> 28:56.360
It'll just be our families,
really intimate, be cozy.

28:56.365 --> 28:57.561
Even smaller.

28:57.918 --> 28:59.152
Me, you and Elvis!

28:59.196 --> 29:00.570
Let's elope, Vegas-style.

29:00.578 --> 29:03.211
Oh, wow, okay, well, yeah, you know.

29:03.245 --> 29:05.131
Planning a wedding can
be such a pain in the ass.

29:05.136 --> 29:08.152
So we'll just have to pick a time
that works for you and I...

29:08.186 --> 29:09.093
How about now?

29:09.096 --> 29:11.742
Now works, too. Let me
just see if I can get a flight.

29:11.768 --> 29:13.011
You know, they may be all booked up.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.032
Well, hey, let's gas up the car
and drive there.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.730
Awesome, a road trip, I love them.

29:16.736 --> 29:18.171
Well, hey, if you don't want to...

29:18.178 --> 29:20.093
No, of course I want to go.
I really want to go.

29:20.096 --> 29:23.101
I just think I need to stop
at home first to, um,

29:23.796 --> 29:26.232
change my underpants, 'cause
you know how I feel about underpants.

29:26.236 --> 29:28.712
Well, come on. It's our honeymoon.
Go commando!

29:29.078 --> 29:30.792
- Awesome.
- Come on, no stops, no excuses.

29:30.796 --> 29:32.072
I am marrying you tonight.

29:32.075 --> 29:33.522
Not if I marry you first.

29:35.846 --> 29:38.893
Yeah, so I guess the plan is
that I'd start there in the fall.

29:38.925 --> 29:40.703
Well, Berkeley's a great school.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.182
Or, you know, so I hear.

29:42.568 --> 29:43.270
How'd you pick it?

29:43.277 --> 29:44.523
Kirsten and I went there.

29:44.528 --> 29:47.202
We met there, so it's
a very special place for us.

29:47.748 --> 29:49.062
Well, that's-that's great.

29:49.068 --> 29:50.262
Family tradition.

29:57.366 --> 30:00.553
Ryan, do you remember the time
we went to San Francisco?

30:00.585 --> 30:01.581
Uh, no.

30:02.696 --> 30:04.710
That's 'cause we never quite made it.

30:05.755 --> 30:09.731
Your mom and I had this idea in our heads
that we should take a family trip.

30:09.765 --> 30:13.380
So we all piled into that old pickup truck we
had and drove up north for the weekend.

30:13.387 --> 30:15.802
But it was just miserable.

30:16.375 --> 30:17.413
Trey got carsick.

30:17.417 --> 30:20.081
We got two flat tires.
Of course, we only had one spare.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.481
Day in the life of the Atwoods.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.103
You know what?

30:22.106 --> 30:25.303
I actually have a photo from that trip.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.763
- Oh, there's no reason...
- Baby pictures, yay!

30:28.445 --> 30:30.091
Oh, my God,

30:30.136 --> 30:31.433
look at baby Ryan.

30:32.867 --> 30:35.282
You could already
see that strong jawline,

30:35.318 --> 30:38.283
those piercing blue eyes that
just stare right into your soul.

30:38.288 --> 30:40.272
That's my cue to get dessert.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.713
Kirsten makes a great key lime pie.

30:42.715 --> 30:45.653
Only if you like key lime, though,
because I actually thought lemon meringue.

30:45.658 --> 30:48.542
And if you want I can just go inside
and whip it right up or...

30:48.548 --> 30:50.003
Peach tort, I make peach...

30:50.038 --> 30:52.450
You know, key lime sounds great.

30:53.156 --> 30:55.041
- You were right.
- I should clear the table.

30:55.048 --> 30:55.820
Well, let me give you a hand.

30:55.826 --> 30:57.222
No, no, sit down, sit down.

30:57.225 --> 31:00.023
You slaved in the kitchen
all day, and you are our guest.

31:00.366 --> 31:02.163
So please, just relax.

31:02.206 --> 31:03.402
Thank you.

31:03.935 --> 31:04.931
Thanks.

31:10.666 --> 31:11.940
So we all survived dinner.

31:11.948 --> 31:12.681
Yeah.

31:12.688 --> 31:15.210
I got to say I didn't start off
a big fan of your father's.

31:15.218 --> 31:16.413
Join the club.

31:16.598 --> 31:18.243
But he's kind of winning me over.

31:18.275 --> 31:19.470
Yeah, huh?

31:19.797 --> 31:21.171
He's different than I remember him.

31:21.187 --> 31:22.182
Well...

31:23.107 --> 31:24.300
people can change.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.762
Too bad all it took was a terminal illness.

31:29.175 --> 31:30.971
But better late then never, I guess.

31:33.138 --> 31:34.132
True.

31:34.815 --> 31:35.963
Looks good.

31:35.968 --> 31:36.412
Yeah.

31:36.418 --> 31:38.072
Will you excuse me for a second,
I got to take this.

31:38.088 --> 31:40.330
Yeah, sure, I'll just take this outside.

31:42.847 --> 31:43.843
Hello.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.580
Yeah, this is Sandy.

31:46.206 --> 31:48.251
Thanks for getting
back to me, Dr. Alessi.

31:49.358 --> 31:51.182
I really appreciate
you doing this for me,

31:51.185 --> 31:53.381
and I understand
the position it puts you in.

31:59.915 --> 32:00.913
I see.

32:02.697 --> 32:03.693
Well...

32:05.718 --> 32:06.711
Okay.

32:09.406 --> 32:10.600
Thank you.

32:11.615 --> 32:13.061
Thank you very much.

32:32.626 --> 32:33.820
Are you okay?

32:33.976 --> 32:35.172
You want to stop?

32:35.665 --> 32:36.860
No, I'm good.

32:37.387 --> 32:38.983
Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?

32:39.428 --> 32:41.071
Sated and quenched, thanks.

32:52.558 --> 32:53.753
I can't do this.

32:53.877 --> 32:55.073
You can't?

32:55.267 --> 32:56.300
No, I can't.

32:56.306 --> 32:58.902
- Because, you know, as much as I love you...
- Yeah?

32:58.918 --> 33:01.462
It just doesn't feel right
getting married.

33:04.007 --> 33:05.951
You know, without asking your father...

33:06.738 --> 33:07.932
for your hand.

33:09.368 --> 33:12.553
You want to ask, um, my dad's
permission to marry me?

33:12.598 --> 33:14.380
I do. Yes, I do.

33:14.428 --> 33:17.412
Cohen, that is such a holdover
to when women were chattel,

33:17.528 --> 33:20.272
Traded between men like
they were property and animals.

33:20.318 --> 33:22.662
Okay, I took two-thirds of
a semester of women's studies and...

33:22.665 --> 33:25.691
Well, I just, I can't do this
to your father, Summer.

33:25.727 --> 33:28.121
We've watched too much golf together.

33:28.665 --> 33:29.643
I love that man.

33:29.646 --> 33:30.643
Okay...

33:31.358 --> 33:33.853
you know, once we ask my dad,
there's no turning back.

33:33.855 --> 33:35.053
Oh, yeah, I know.

33:36.485 --> 33:37.483
Okay.

33:38.545 --> 33:41.043
Hey, well, let's head
on home and make it official.

33:42.998 --> 33:43.993
Okay.

33:45.817 --> 33:48.601
All I know is you're a ballplayer
and then I go away and suddenly,

33:48.606 --> 33:49.872
you're in musicals?

33:50.227 --> 33:51.420
Mom had her dreams.

33:51.615 --> 33:53.983
Don't you worry, Mr. Atwood,
I'll straighten him out.

33:53.988 --> 33:55.743
Hey, you know what?
I like this girl, Ryan.

33:55.746 --> 33:57.010
I told you he'd like me.

33:57.017 --> 33:58.461
I should make some coffee.

33:58.706 --> 34:00.330
Sorry, I had a call.

34:00.918 --> 34:02.730
- Decaf, hon?
- No, I'm good. Frank.

34:04.156 --> 34:05.750
Can I speak to you for a minute?

34:07.577 --> 34:09.760
Yeah, sure, excuse me.

34:16.675 --> 34:18.440
Hey, Sandy, thanks again for everything.

34:18.446 --> 34:20.862
I mean, this has been
a great evening, great dinner.

34:20.864 --> 34:24.513
Yeah, well, when a man doesn't have
a lot of time left, every meal counts.

34:25.928 --> 34:26.772
Yeah, right.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.301
Why are you doing this, Frank?

34:29.175 --> 34:30.053
What are you talking about?

34:30.054 --> 34:32.391
You're his father. He would have
wanted to see you either way,

34:32.396 --> 34:34.692
and now he's going to find out
you lied to him.

34:36.567 --> 34:39.210
I made some phone calls.
You're as healthy as a horse.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.981
You, uh... you checked up on my story?

34:42.016 --> 34:44.561
Yeah, for good reason.
Your story doesn't check out.

34:46.246 --> 34:47.453
The cab is on its way.

34:47.466 --> 34:50.100
Now before you go, tell Ryan the truth.

34:52.708 --> 34:53.902
Or I will.

34:56.688 --> 34:59.803
Look, you're wrong
about him wanting to see me.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.040
He didn't.

35:01.537 --> 35:04.720
You know, he...
Even though I came here clean

35:04.996 --> 35:07.540
and I-I-I was sorry,
he still didn't want to see me.

35:08.405 --> 35:10.203
Are you going to tell Ryan, or am I?

35:11.028 --> 35:12.220
Is everything okay?

35:19.628 --> 35:20.622
Frank?

35:23.898 --> 35:25.360
Frank, you got something
you want to say?

35:25.365 --> 35:26.650
- Nope, nothing.
- What's the matter?

35:26.655 --> 35:27.951
Then I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

35:27.956 --> 35:29.472
- I'm not going anywhere.
- This is my house.

35:29.476 --> 35:30.671
And he's my son.

35:31.076 --> 35:32.272
Not anymore.

35:34.898 --> 35:36.880
I've extended you every courtesy.

35:36.928 --> 35:38.032
Now, I'm going to have
to show you the door.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.162
Hey, don't touch me.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.342
Oh, come on. Let's go.

35:40.345 --> 35:42.043
Or what? You don't want to hit me.

35:43.287 --> 35:44.481
Oh, yes, I do.

35:47.067 --> 35:48.371
That was a mistake, Sandy.

35:48.376 --> 35:49.771
I'm standing right here, Frank.

35:49.778 --> 35:51.220
Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop!

35:52.698 --> 35:54.142
What the hell is going on?

35:55.426 --> 35:57.472
Ryan, your father
wants to tell something.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.400
All right, come on. Let's talk outside.

36:07.578 --> 36:09.020
Sandy, what on earth?

36:09.705 --> 36:12.852
Well, the good news is,
Frank Atwood is going to outlive us all.

36:13.418 --> 36:14.612
The bad news?

36:15.746 --> 36:17.191
My hand is killing me.

36:17.496 --> 36:18.643
I'll get you some ice.

36:18.647 --> 36:19.843
Thank you.

36:26.025 --> 36:26.933
That was pretty good.

36:26.938 --> 36:28.220
Oh, you saw the halftime show?

36:28.226 --> 36:29.821
I don't watch girls' basketball.

36:29.976 --> 36:31.380
Chicks with big hands freak me out.

36:31.386 --> 36:33.722
So you must mean, like,
today in class, huh?

36:34.266 --> 36:35.461
You liked that?

36:36.125 --> 36:38.123
Maybe you're not a total geek after all.

36:38.398 --> 36:39.840
I mean, you're still a geek,

36:40.636 --> 36:42.083
but you got me pretty good.

36:42.648 --> 36:43.530
I've got to respect that.

36:43.537 --> 36:45.233
Well, your speech was pretty good.

36:45.265 --> 36:46.593
And I've got to respect that.

36:46.598 --> 36:48.843
It's not like I care
if you respect me or not.

36:49.487 --> 36:50.680
But thanks.

36:54.977 --> 36:57.990
So got anything else to say?

36:58.986 --> 37:01.170
No, what else would I say?

37:01.208 --> 37:03.040
I don't know, it's just
that you're still standing here.

37:03.047 --> 37:04.240
So are you.

37:07.078 --> 37:09.112
Do you maybe, like,
want to do something?

37:10.378 --> 37:11.572
Something with you?

37:13.767 --> 37:14.963
I don't think so.

37:15.408 --> 37:17.562
Good, 'cause, 'cause
I didn't want to do nothing anyway.

37:17.568 --> 37:18.762
I was just asking.

37:19.707 --> 37:21.532
Really, because that's what you do?

37:21.568 --> 37:23.262
Just ask people what they're doing?

37:23.267 --> 37:24.660
Exactly, yep.

37:24.696 --> 37:26.683
Well, then why don't you ask
this guy what he's doing?

37:26.686 --> 37:28.350
What? Nah, I'm good.

37:28.386 --> 37:30.410
Hey, guy, do you want
to do something with him?

37:30.417 --> 37:31.253
Because he's...

37:31.256 --> 37:33.472
Shut up.
Hey, she playing, she playing.

37:33.865 --> 37:34.861
What?

37:35.057 --> 37:36.753
- Sorry.
- Trying to be funny, huh?

37:37.418 --> 37:39.012
Ryan, it was one lie.

37:39.056 --> 37:41.450
- Kind of a big one.
- I needed to buy some time.

37:41.555 --> 37:43.903
I just wanted you
to get to know me better,

37:43.948 --> 37:46.192
so that, you know,
maybe you could forgive me.

37:47.046 --> 37:50.072
Of all the bad things I've done,
this doesn't even make the top ten.

37:50.077 --> 37:51.693
Yeah. That's a hell of a point.

37:51.736 --> 37:54.112
Look, I want to do better.
Will you help me?

38:02.255 --> 38:03.161
I think you should just go.

38:03.168 --> 38:04.362
- Ryan!
- It's too soon.

38:04.367 --> 38:07.011
- I've worked so hard to get...
- Not for you, for me.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.211
Oh. Yeah.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.121
Okay.

38:24.085 --> 38:25.783
Sorry, not much of a hugger.

38:25.816 --> 38:27.010
Yeah, I know.

38:28.025 --> 38:30.222
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened in there.

38:32.235 --> 38:33.431
All right, see you.

38:36.866 --> 38:38.060
I'll call you.

39:03.616 --> 39:04.853
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:04.887 --> 39:07.060
- Did your dad leave?
- When you get decked after dessert,

39:07.077 --> 39:09.023
it's usually a time to call it a night.

39:09.115 --> 39:10.112
Good tip.

39:12.766 --> 39:13.960
So are you okay?

39:14.506 --> 39:15.950
First dinner with the family.

39:16.186 --> 39:17.943
Very impressive.

39:19.015 --> 39:20.122
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

39:20.128 --> 39:21.750
Are you kidding? It was amazing.

39:21.796 --> 39:25.682
Well, not amazing,
but, you know intense.

39:26.785 --> 39:27.971
And we went through it together,

39:27.977 --> 39:31.611
so it was kind of like our first
major relationship milestone.

39:31.648 --> 39:32.673
Yeah, I guess it was.

39:32.688 --> 39:35.430
And now you are totally prepared
for dinner with my mom.

39:37.548 --> 39:39.240
Well, no family is perfect, right?

39:40.087 --> 39:41.531
Yours is pretty close.

39:44.095 --> 39:45.333
You should go spend time with them.

39:45.336 --> 39:46.532
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:46.788 --> 39:48.630
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- All right.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.282
- Hey!
- You all right?

39:59.318 --> 40:01.933
I'm from the Bronx.
I used to hit guys all the time.

40:01.968 --> 40:03.590
Key term: "used to."

40:05.158 --> 40:07.311
I am sorry I lost my cool back there.

40:07.347 --> 40:08.790
He kind of asked for it.

40:09.398 --> 40:11.890
And I'm sorry things didn't
work out with your dad.

40:12.685 --> 40:14.152
My dad is right here.

40:15.558 --> 40:17.000
But you know, if you want,

40:17.038 --> 40:19.311
I can teach you a mean
left hook, just in case.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.821
Just in case what? You got more relatives
showing up here or what?

40:21.826 --> 40:24.242
- I have some mean uncles.
- I bet you do.

40:27.085 --> 40:29.762
Well, you get caught lying about cancer,
you're going to get punched,

40:29.765 --> 40:30.771
those are the rules.

40:30.777 --> 40:32.582
Yeah, I just wanted time with the kid.

40:32.588 --> 40:34.512
I don't think I would have
said or done anything.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.142
I understand, believe me.

40:37.147 --> 40:40.193
No matter what lie I told,
I would have got caught eventually.

40:40.317 --> 40:42.813
God knows Sandy's caught me
in more than a few whoppers.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.361
He's just looking out for Ryan.

40:45.186 --> 40:46.552
If I'd done a little more
of that in my day,

40:46.557 --> 40:49.003
I wouldn't be in this position
in the first place.

40:49.547 --> 40:50.991
So where you going to go now?

40:51.985 --> 40:53.781
Bullet's got opportunities all over.

40:54.066 --> 40:56.440
I'll think of something.

40:57.488 --> 40:58.682
As for you,

41:00.835 --> 41:03.131
this ought to keep things
straight with Gordon.

41:03.188 --> 41:07.131
I think you'll find these books are cooked,
so you can hide as much as you make.

41:07.336 --> 41:09.721
Oh, the prostitution ring. No.

41:09.765 --> 41:12.881
After you busted me on New Year's,
I made a resolution to quit.

41:13.278 --> 41:14.822
It's hard out there for a pimp.

41:15.536 --> 41:17.161
It's a nice little operation.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.620
I mean in no time, you could pay
for that house you live in.

41:20.875 --> 41:22.321
Be financially independent.

41:23.655 --> 41:24.651
Here,

41:24.926 --> 41:26.410
- you think about it.
- Okay.

41:29.017 --> 41:32.321
I, uh, I want to thank you
for everything, Julie.

41:48.946 --> 41:49.941
See you.

41:50.296 --> 41:52.782
Yeah. Uh, keep in touch.

42:04.148 --> 42:05.440
- Hey.
- Hi, everybody.

42:05.446 --> 42:07.020
Look at you.
Where were you?

42:07.057 --> 42:09.391
Uh, I was working late.
Sorry I missed dinner.

42:09.438 --> 42:11.650
That's all right. I noticed
you're not nursing a bunny.

42:11.657 --> 42:12.683
I noticed that, too.

42:12.686 --> 42:14.912
Yes, Pancakes is with his mother

42:14.918 --> 42:18.443
since I'm going to be heading up
to Seattle to visit Dr. Roberts.

42:18.686 --> 42:19.993
Oh, that's odd.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.830
Speaking of fathers, where's Ryan's?

42:23.025 --> 42:24.223
Sandy punched him.

42:25.826 --> 42:27.271
You punched a dying man?

42:27.778 --> 42:29.400
Well, it turns out he wasn't dying.

42:29.405 --> 42:31.683
- That's why he punched him.
- Miss one dinner around here...

42:31.686 --> 42:34.382
Well, you're home now.
Get on the couch. It's family time.

42:34.385 --> 42:35.930
- Is it family time?
- Come on.

42:35.967 --> 42:37.463
Sit thee down.

42:38.406 --> 42:40.002
All right, what are we watching?

42:40.068 --> 42:42.250
- Well, it's about meerkats.
- Meerkats.

42:42.295 --> 42:43.163
Why are we watching it?

42:43.166 --> 42:44.501
Because I wanted to.

42:44.506 --> 42:47.942
And we don't want to get your mother angry.
You haven't seen her right cross.

42:47.947 --> 42:49.253
Dad's pretty good though.

42:49.255 --> 42:51.041
That makes sense.
He was in a gang.

42:54.148 --> 42:56.743
We robbed the poor...

42:56.745 --> 42:58.971
How many people did you say you stabed?
