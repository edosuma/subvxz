WEBVTT

00:20.188 --> 00:21.690
(MUFFLED THUDDING)

00:30.615 --> 00:31.700
(DISTORTED)
He's got a good pulse.

00:31.825 --> 00:33.660
Maintain head stabilization
and flip him over.

00:33.785 --> 00:36.204
On my count, guys.
Ready? Go.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.255
Sir, we're paramedics.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.923
The mailman saw you
having a seizure.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.049
<i>We had to break down
your door.</i>

00:50.802 --> 00:52.554
You know
what your name is?

00:54.848 --> 00:58.143
On my count,
one, two, three, up.

01:00.687 --> 01:02.439
We're taking you
to the hospital.

01:04.357 --> 01:10.822
I can't. No, I can't.
No, I can't...

01:17.871 --> 01:21.291
Hey, buddy, buddy,
we're trying to help.

01:25.378 --> 01:26.212
PARAMEDIC: Sir.

01:26.337 --> 01:27.380
Stay out of my house.

01:27.505 --> 01:31.843
You just had a seizure, you could have
a stroke, a bleed in your brain.

01:31.968 --> 01:33.219
Leave me alone.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.088
35-year-old male, crushing headache,
and three seizures in the last two days.

02:09.214 --> 02:13.384
So it's a bleed, a clot,
a tumor, metabolic or infection.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.136
- Stick him in the CT and...
- Can't.

02:16.346 --> 02:18.431
I'm assuming he has
a giant head.

02:18.556 --> 02:21.351
Severe agoraphobe.
The world scares the hell out of him.

02:21.476 --> 02:23.645
So we can only test him
with whatever we can take to him.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.272
- Fun.
- The agoraphobia a symptom?

02:26.397 --> 02:27.899
Only of being shot.

02:28.024 --> 02:30.276
He and his girlfriend were mugged
seven years ago. It's when it started.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.071
Anybody can hate humanity
after getting shot.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.823
It takes a big man
to hate it beforehand.

02:34.948 --> 02:37.116
How did you get this case,
if he didn't come to the ER?

02:37.242 --> 02:39.661
I talked to him through his door
when he had flu last year.

02:39.786 --> 02:41.579
I run the Community
Outreach Program now.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.915
See?
Perfectly reasonable explanation.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.793
She's definitely not here
trying to work her way back on the team

02:46.918 --> 02:48.002
and steal your job
or anything.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.630
- It's a legitimate question.
- He agreed to meet with us.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.507
But even if I can get
inside his house,

02:52.632 --> 02:54.676
his brain
is a black box.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.179
We can pick this up
in a minute.

02:59.430 --> 03:02.684
- What's this?
- Takeout menus.

03:02.809 --> 03:04.102
But I'm hoping
you'll come up with a better answer

03:04.227 --> 03:06.563
when everyone asks
what we're talking about.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.440
- Last night...
- Forget it.

03:09.566 --> 03:11.776
I know this is awkward,
but we need to talk.

03:11.901 --> 03:15.280
There's a reason that we've evolved
the feeling of awkwardness.

03:15.405 --> 03:18.157
It tells us
not to talk about things.

03:18.283 --> 03:20.743
I was emotional
because of the adoption falling through,

03:20.869 --> 03:24.163
and you actually
let your human side show for a moment.

03:24.289 --> 03:25.874
That is why we kissed.

03:25.999 --> 03:29.961
I just want to say thank you
for not taking advantage.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.550
You're welcome. Any time you
want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.681
Portable equipment can't distinguish a
bleed or a tumor, can't see vasculitis.

03:41.806 --> 03:43.391
What did Cuddy want?

03:44.058 --> 03:47.812
I kind of hit that last night,
so now she's all on my jock.

03:47.937 --> 03:50.523
Wow. She looks pretty good
for someone on roofies.

03:50.648 --> 03:53.192
The only equipment we have
is a sonogram and a portable x-ray.

03:53.318 --> 03:57.614
What part of "olivine, pyroxene
and amphibole" don't you understand?

03:57.739 --> 04:00.325
Pyroxene?
"Pyro" means "fire."

04:00.450 --> 04:02.201
CAMERON:
They're indicator minerals.

04:02.327 --> 04:04.704
You can't see diamonds,
so you look for the indicator minerals.

04:04.829 --> 04:09.042
I assume the diamond
is the tumor or bleed or whatever it is.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.543
Provoke a seizure.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.712
The indicator
is the increased electrical activity

04:12.837 --> 04:16.090
focused around the abnormality.
We do an EEG, see the focus,

04:16.215 --> 04:19.385
see where the problem is,
which tells us what the problem is.

04:19.510 --> 04:23.056
The Formster and the Camster,
kicking it old school.

04:23.181 --> 04:26.309
Thank God she's not
trying to steal your job.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.270
Go do it,
and search the home for toxins.

04:30.772 --> 04:32.565
NOZICK: I agreed to talk,
not to let you in.

04:32.690 --> 04:33.942
You could be very sick.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.861
- We need access.
- I'm just not ready.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.404
Why does he have
two locked doors?

04:38.529 --> 04:40.281
He must use this room
as an airlock.

04:40.406 --> 04:42.992
Deliveries in, garbage out,
he never has to go outside.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.037
Just tell us when you are.
We're not going away.

04:46.162 --> 04:46.996
Seriously?

04:47.121 --> 04:47.956
THIRTEEN:
You want her to admit

04:48.081 --> 04:50.667
that all he has to do is ignore us
for a few minutes and we'll take off?

04:50.792 --> 04:52.835
He was shot,
girlfriend killed.

04:52.961 --> 04:54.712
He probably has
post-traumatic stress disorder.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.632
He doesn't believe in a just universe,
he doesn't trust anyone.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.050
Give him some honesty.

05:02.095 --> 05:03.721
I shouldn't have implied
we'd wait forever.

05:03.846 --> 05:07.558
We've got a whole hospital full of
patients. We can give you a few minutes,

05:07.684 --> 05:11.229
but eventually, if you don't let us in
we're going to have to leave.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.483
NOZICK:
Just one person comes in.

05:15.608 --> 05:18.528
No, we've got to search
the whole house for toxins.

05:20.071 --> 05:23.992
How about I examine you in one room,
and my colleagues will do the search?

05:25.076 --> 05:26.244
(LOCKS CLICKING)

05:30.999 --> 05:32.625
I'm going to try
to provoke a seizure.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.919
I need you to look
straight ahead, okay?

05:35.920 --> 05:36.754
Yeah.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.674
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just...

05:40.717 --> 05:44.262
I haven't been in a room
with anyone for a while.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.889
- Okay, can you just give me a second?
- Sure.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.141
Okay-

05:49.308 --> 05:52.395
You're the person I talked to
through the door last year, right?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.856
- Yeah.
- You were nice.

05:56.065 --> 06:00.528
And smart. Kind of made me
expect someone older.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.113
I'm not that young.

06:05.241 --> 06:09.829
- Must have been scary being shot.
- Don't do that. Okay.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.914
You don't know me.

06:13.124 --> 06:16.044
I've got everything
I want here.

06:16.169 --> 06:18.880
I make a lot of money
writing tech manuals.

06:19.005 --> 06:20.965
I get stuff delivered.
I work out.

06:21.090 --> 06:26.220
I see anything I want over the Web.
I'm happy here.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.892
- You don't seem very happy.
- Right now I'm not.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.399
Go away.

06:39.817 --> 06:40.651
(SIGHS)

06:40.777 --> 06:44.155
- Did you speak to Cuddy last night?
- She's fine.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.784
Why would it take anyone more than a
few hours to get over misplacing a baby?

06:47.909 --> 06:49.368
You spoke to her?

06:50.036 --> 06:53.623
Kind of hit that,
so she's all on my jock.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.668
(EXCLAIMING IN DISBELIEF)

06:57.794 --> 06:59.003
What?

07:00.379 --> 07:01.380
Huh!

07:01.589 --> 07:03.216
Everyone else thought
I was kidding.

07:03.341 --> 07:08.679
You "hit"?
Like making out or full-on sex or...

07:08.805 --> 07:11.682
I've got a chart laid out with all
the bases, I'll take you through it.

07:11.808 --> 07:14.310
- What are you going to do?
- What can I do?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.479
I'm gonna ignore her
for the rest of my life.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.689
This mosquito bite
kept me awake...

07:18.815 --> 07:20.066
Don't care
about the bug bite.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.443
She's your boss.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.779
So now I have two reasons
to ignore her.

07:26.823 --> 07:28.741
It was just a kiss.

07:28.866 --> 07:32.161
- There's a reason...
- Yes, those large things in her bra.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.540
...you were hiding it from me.
Means it meant something to you.

07:35.665 --> 07:39.293
Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it
within the phrase "I hit that."

07:39.418 --> 07:40.837
Stop scratching,
you'll draw blood.

07:40.962 --> 07:42.964
Finally,
you said something useful.

07:43.089 --> 07:46.050
I'm just gonna break the skin
and let the poison out.

07:46.551 --> 07:47.468
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

07:47.593 --> 07:51.931
If you dated Cuddy,
there would...

07:52.056 --> 07:54.892
Sorry, I get better reception
when you're not here.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.019
What do you got?

07:57.145 --> 07:58.104
<i>TAUB: His place is totally clean.</i>

07:58.229 --> 08:01.649
No animals. No hidden drugs or alcohol.
No lead in the paint.

08:01.774 --> 08:03.317
And since
you're not breathing hard,

08:03.442 --> 08:05.945
I assume you're not holding
Cameron aloft in triumph,

08:06.070 --> 08:07.530
which means no seizures.

08:08.865 --> 08:13.661
Hey, speaking of breathing hard...
Cameron, you engaged to Chase yet?

08:13.786 --> 08:14.829
THIRTEEN:
Sorry, we should have clarified.

08:14.954 --> 08:17.165
We're calling about the patient,
not Dr. Cameron's love life.

08:17.290 --> 08:18.332
We aren't engaged.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.710
Moves things along much faster
if you just give him the answers.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.295
Seizures can also
be induced through...

08:22.420 --> 08:24.547
- After six years?
- A year-and-a-half.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.215
Through sleep deprivation or...

08:26.340 --> 08:28.509
Sleep deprivation
would take too long.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.761
- You living together?
- We spend most nights together.

08:30.887 --> 08:34.056
There's a bunch of drugs
that can lower a seizure threshold.

08:34.182 --> 08:36.642
And cloud the diagnosis
with side effects.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.728
- His place or yours?
- His, usually.

08:38.853 --> 08:40.313
- Interesting.
- You would have said "interesting"

08:40.438 --> 08:41.689
no matter
what the answer.

08:41.814 --> 08:43.608
And no matter what the answer,
it would have been interesting.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.860
<i>No engagement,
commitment issues.</i>

08:45.985 --> 08:50.781
His place, control issues.
Not sure whose, but, interesting.

08:50.907 --> 08:52.575
Yeah, moves
much faster this way.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.412
Where was the patient
when he had his first seizure?

08:56.537 --> 08:58.831
In his entry hallway,
getting his mail.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.459
And getting close
to the outdoors.

09:01.584 --> 09:04.670
It spooked him, raised his BP.
Now use that fear.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.838
Bring him outside.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.298
He punched out
a fireman.

09:07.423 --> 09:08.758
<i>We're doctors,
not bouncers.</i>

09:10.343 --> 09:13.262
Okay.
So bring the outside to him.

09:14.639 --> 09:17.141
Floor's genuine wood.

09:18.351 --> 09:20.394
Why are they here?

09:20.519 --> 09:23.689
They overheard me announce
the half-price bank foreclosure

09:23.814 --> 09:26.442
in the ER waiting room.
Where is everybody?

09:26.567 --> 09:30.655
Cameron's with the patient,
everybody else went home.

09:30.780 --> 09:35.076
Because they don't need to be here.
Neither do you, and yet you are.

09:35.785 --> 09:36.994
This way.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.622
Moldings original?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.333
Original?
They were here before the house.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.046
The shut-in
is also original.

09:48.214 --> 09:51.509
- Come on, don't be shy.
- House, get them out of here.

09:51.634 --> 09:55.680
Easy for you to say, you're not going
to be making some serious capital gains.

09:55.805 --> 09:57.139
(GROANING)
This is cruel.

09:57.265 --> 09:59.767
And leaving him undiagnosed
is what, altruistic?

10:03.145 --> 10:06.274
Procedure worked. He's seizing.
What do you see?

10:06.399 --> 10:08.985
Normal theta,
normal delta.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.486
This isn't a seizure.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.946
It's something.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.698
Mr. Nozick,
are you okay?

10:13.823 --> 10:15.574
My stomach.
It's killing me.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.868
See? It's something.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.215
KUTNER:
Partial small bowel obstruction.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.927
Blockage explains the pain. What
explains the blockage plus seizures?

10:35.052 --> 10:36.762
Atrial fibrillation
throwing emboli.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.306
Crohn's causing
an abscess.

10:38.431 --> 10:39.932
It could be
a million things.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.643
There's no way to know unless we get him
in for an MRI on his head,

10:42.768 --> 10:45.604
or exploratory surgery
so we can biopsy his bowels,

10:45.730 --> 10:47.481
- which he won't let us do.
- Wouldn't.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.568
Pain changes things.

10:51.777 --> 10:52.987
House.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.034
He told you
to stay out of here.

10:58.159 --> 11:01.037
He can chase me out
once he's done doubling up in agony.

11:01.787 --> 11:06.500
Whatever your big problem is has caused
a complication we call "colon FOS."

11:06.625 --> 11:10.671
"F-0", "full of," since we're
in mixed company, "S" is "stool."

11:10.796 --> 11:13.966
Nothing is coming out,
so the pain's gonna get worse and worse.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.344
So we need to stick
a pooper scooper in you.

11:16.469 --> 11:18.262
We also need to take
a look at your bowel.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.597
I made my wishes clear.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.350
Uh-huh. And, see,
if the Crazy Fairy were here,

11:22.475 --> 11:23.559
she could grant them.

11:23.684 --> 11:28.064
I'm not insane.
I feel pain when I go outside,

11:28.189 --> 11:30.733
so it's rational
to avoid that pain.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.777
Except now you're
feeling pain inside.

11:32.902 --> 11:34.570
Well, not as bad.
Nowhere near.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.946
We can give him drugs
for the blockage.

11:36.072 --> 11:37.531
If it doesn't work

11:37.656 --> 11:39.950
that blockage
will rupture your intestines

11:40.076 --> 11:42.036
and spew sewage
throughout your body.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.873
Whatever you're scared of out there,
aren't you more scared of death?

11:47.333 --> 11:49.877
You, obviously,
can't stand people.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.505
But for me, it's worse.
All right?

11:52.630 --> 11:55.800
I'd rather die in here
than live out there.

12:02.014 --> 12:06.268
If you don't mind floppy hair
and an annoying accent,

12:06.394 --> 12:09.021
I know a surgeon who will
operate in your home.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.233
Thank you.

12:16.487 --> 12:18.906
With the risk of infection,
Chase won't actually...

12:19.031 --> 12:22.868
He's not gonna do surgery
in some crazy dude's house.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.787
- You just said...
- What I said was

12:24.912 --> 12:26.831
that Chase would put him under
at the house.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.791
We take him to the hospital,
open him up, do our thing,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.751
then slip him back into his room
for the post-op,

12:30.876 --> 12:33.462
without him ever finding out
that we tricked him.

12:33.963 --> 12:35.423
So, that was implied.

12:35.548 --> 12:36.799
- It's unethical.
- He'll be asleep.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.884
He gets to make his own calls,
even if he's asleep.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.428
Why are you
siding with him?

12:41.679 --> 12:46.016
Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes
broken people because her husband died,

12:46.142 --> 12:47.268
and since Chase
isn't all that broken...

12:47.393 --> 12:49.353
Hey, why don't we operate
on his infarcted leg while we're at it?

12:49.478 --> 12:51.147
Who cares if he said no?

12:51.272 --> 12:53.065
I was risking my life
to avoid becoming a cripple,

12:53.190 --> 12:55.943
he's doing it to avoid
sunlight and fresh air.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.614
We've got to
make it look good.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.587
I know I'm a pain
in the ass.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.257
I know it would have been easy
just to walk away,

13:20.301 --> 13:21.927
but you're a good person.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.895
Count down from 10.

13:33.022 --> 13:35.566
NOZICK: Ten, nine,

13:36.567 --> 13:37.735
eight...

13:39.403 --> 13:40.738
Let's go.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.924
- How you doing?
- Better.

14:00.049 --> 14:01.258
Great.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.886
Everything else good?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.597
Everything involving me
kissing House is good.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.391
Oh, God, you dragged it out of me,
you're a genius.

14:10.601 --> 14:11.977
It's no big deal.

14:12.102 --> 14:16.440
I was feeling vulnerable,
he's a friend, and I leaned on him.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.818
It's funny.
I've leaned on friends in the past.

14:19.944 --> 14:23.364
Never leaned so far
my tongue fell into their mouths.

14:25.324 --> 14:28.702
I don't think of House that way.
I never have.

14:31.247 --> 14:32.581
Why not?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.709
You know exactly
how it would go.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.211
It would
start off exciting,

14:37.336 --> 14:40.631
we'd get caught up in the novelty
and the hostility and the forbiddenness,

14:40.756 --> 14:44.927
and then we'd realize that
the flirty hostility is just hostility,

14:45.052 --> 14:48.222
his inability to open up
is no longer exciting,

14:48.347 --> 14:52.184
it's just frustrating,
and then it's the inevitable blow up

14:52.309 --> 14:56.272
and the recriminations,
and we don't talk for two months.

14:59.108 --> 15:04.113
Yeah. Well, it certainly proves you've
never thought about House that way.

15:06.574 --> 15:07.741
I get your point.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.952
I will be more careful with my tongue
in the future.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.245
That's not my point.

15:12.621 --> 15:17.585
Maybe novelty and hostility and
forbiddenness doesn't have to end bad.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.590
(PAGER BUZZING)

15:23.799 --> 15:25.342
Got to go.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.137
What time you done?

15:28.262 --> 15:30.472
Thought we could try
that new sushi place next to my house.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.474
Why don't we stay
at my house tonight?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.601
But we always stay at mine.

15:33.726 --> 15:37.062
That's what I mean.
We used to split, what happened?

15:37.187 --> 15:39.607
- I don't know, I'm closer to work.
- By five minutes.

15:39.732 --> 15:43.319
And my house doesn't look like it
was decorated by a drunk rugby player.

15:43.444 --> 15:45.529
Well, we can discuss it.
I hadn't really...

15:45.654 --> 15:48.907
Why does it have to be a discussion?
Can't you just stay over?

15:50.034 --> 15:53.912
You do know they page me when that much
surgical equipment is signed out.

15:55.581 --> 15:56.415
CUDDY: He didn't consent.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.583
He consented to the surgery.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.251
You think he's going
to sue over where?

15:59.376 --> 16:01.086
He won't even know where.
He'll wake up in his house,

16:01.211 --> 16:02.254
he won't know a thing
about what happened.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.215
Until he catches a post surgical
infection in his dirty apartment

16:05.341 --> 16:08.594
and finds out we tricked him
and winds up owning the hospital.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.513
Why aren't you
arguing with her?

16:11.639 --> 16:12.890
Because she's right.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.518
I don't care where he gets the post-op,
just that he gets it.

16:16.644 --> 16:17.770
Keep him here.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.986
House?

16:26.445 --> 16:27.863
You Okay?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.115

That's weird. I usually
don't get the stigmata until Easter.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.589
Please tell Dr. Chase
the patient's ready for him now.

16:57.351 --> 17:00.604
Stewart, wake up.
It's Dr. Cameron.

17:02.815 --> 17:04.358
If you can hear me,
blink.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.697
We were concerned for your safety,
so we brought you to the hospital.

(MUMBLING)

17:13.242 --> 17:14.743
No, it's okay.

- No, it's okay.
- Why'd you...

17:18.205 --> 17:19.373
I just wanted
to keep you informed.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.917
I didn't want you to have a bad shock
while you're recovering from surgery.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.502
- I got to get out of here.
- It's okay, Stewart.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.547
Calm down.
Calm down. Stewart.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.549
- Stewart, I'm going to sedate you.
- I got to get out of here.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.384
I'm gonna sedate you.

17:30.509 --> 17:31.885
No!

17:32.010 --> 17:37.182

(MONITORS BEEPING)

17:45.816 --> 17:47.484
What did you do?

17:52.990 --> 17:55.993
Well done. Your patient
called his lawyer, threatened to sue us,

17:56.118 --> 17:59.079
is now heading home
completely undiagnosed.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.956
He'll soon be on his way back.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.126
He's sick. He'll crash,
he'll lose consciousness,

18:04.251 --> 18:06.253
and I'll declare an emergency,
bring him back in.

18:06.378 --> 18:10.215
Not any more you won't. His lawyer
now holds his health care proxy.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.592
The next time
we have an emergency,

18:11.717 --> 18:14.219
Larry Ruseckas, Esquire,
will be calling the shots.

18:14.344 --> 18:17.181
I made the right call. If he
had flipped out after major surgery,

18:17.306 --> 18:18.182
it would have been worse.

18:18.307 --> 18:21.769
The benefit of being boss
is that I don't have to argue.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.395
You're all off the case.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.574
What's going on
between you and Cuddy?

18:35.699 --> 18:36.909
Bad loving gone bad.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.119
Seriously, why didn't you argue with
her? She just threw us off the case.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.079
Because ignoring her
is a lot easier.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.915
Convince the patient
to let us back in again.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.459
See if you can clear
his blockage with lactulose.

18:45.584 --> 18:49.546
If this thing kills him before we
can diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.382
Okay-

18:53.008 --> 18:54.510
You're going to
keep working on this?

18:54.635 --> 18:56.303
Yeah.
I brought in the case.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.473
There is no case. He's gone, you've been
tossed. This is totally nuts.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.016
He's incredibly sick.
We don't know...

19:01.141 --> 19:02.142
Fine,
forget about the patient.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.727
What is going on
with you?

19:03.894 --> 19:05.187
This is why we left
House's team.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.272
To avoid this constant flood
of pure craziness.

19:07.397 --> 19:10.025
That's why I left House.
You got fired.

19:13.904 --> 19:16.406
I'm sorry.
I know I let you down.

19:17.574 --> 19:18.742
But you know

different implies difference?

a million times before.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.843
No,

20:17.968 --> 20:19.970

come running to me to complain,

any chance for happiness.

so much to you?

with the adverb "vicariously"?

was just a trick.

We hung the drapes.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.028
We'd have seen it
on the intestines.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.447
What did we see
on the intestines?

24:07.572 --> 24:11.576
<i>Pink mucosa, flattened villi. If it's
not Whipple's, it's gotta be celiac.</i>

24:11.701 --> 24:13.662
Wheat allergy
means he's not absorbing nutrients.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.789
Explains the seizures,
the stomach and now the nerves.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.457
<i>THIRTEEN: We should run
a blood test for celiac.</i>

24:17.582 --> 24:22.129
Not fast enough, not accurate enough.
Force feed him wheat.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.297
<i>Then do an endoscopy
as it hits his duodenum.</i>

24:24.422 --> 24:25.924
See if there's
an allergic reaction.

24:26.049 --> 24:29.845
His guts just exploded. It might be
a tad painful to make him eat.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.889
That's House's point.
There's nothing diagnostic about it.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.225
He's trying to put the patient in pain,
force him to come in.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.393
It is a valid test.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.979
So is the blood test,
which is painless.

24:39.104 --> 24:42.566
<i>HOUSE: Foreman, listen to
that little voice in your head</i>

24:42.691 --> 24:46.444
that's coming from the telephone.
Force feed him.

24:46.570 --> 24:49.948
Don't. You know House.
You know I'm right.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.908
We'll do both tests.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.835
I'm not here to
play matchmaker.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.796
Okay-

25:04.921 --> 25:06.506
House basically...

25:07.424 --> 25:11.887
Well, he accused me
of being interested in you.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.557
He's just trying
to change the subject.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.768
I know. But I do have...

25:21.354 --> 25:24.608
I've always had

25:24.733 --> 25:26.735
some feelings for you.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.364
Are you saying
you want to date me?

25:31.489 --> 25:32.699
No, I...

25:33.366 --> 25:36.786
It wouldn't be fair to House,
and it's too soon after Amber.

25:38.788 --> 25:41.333
But you thought
you should just say it?

25:41.458 --> 25:43.293
Yeah, I thought
you should know.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.507
Let's have dinner
tomorrow night.

25:52.302 --> 25:53.553
Okay-

25:54.971 --> 25:58.391
Or maybe it'd be better
if we just had sex.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.144
Pardon me?

26:01.269 --> 26:02.938
In front of House's office.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.440
I mean, I don't want to
take any chances.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.276
I assume the point of this
is to make him jealous,

26:08.401 --> 26:11.446
to make him realize that
he does want a relationship with me.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.407
Yes.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.244
You think it'll work?

26:17.369 --> 26:18.995
You're an idiot.

26:19.120 --> 26:23.208
Trust me, everybody will be happier
if House and I aren't dating.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.344
You sure
this is the best test?

26:34.469 --> 26:37.097
No. But you've kind of
tied our hands.

26:37.222 --> 26:40.183
As soon as this hits your intestines,
I'll look at it through an endoscope.

26:42.978 --> 26:45.313
Stewart, I know you don't want
to talk about this,

26:47.357 --> 26:50.151
but people who get shot
often get PTSD.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.861
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.991
It's very treatable
with drugs and therapy.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.617
It's not PTSD.

26:59.703 --> 27:03.623
My girlfriend was with me
when I got shot, and she died.

27:05.292 --> 27:06.626
(SIGHS)

27:07.210 --> 27:08.920
(WHISPERING)
I'm sorry.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.214
But that's what I mean.
I lost someone myself.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.175
I know it's traumatic.

27:15.552 --> 27:18.596
No. What I'm trying
to say is that

27:20.765 --> 27:25.061
I was like this before the shooting,
since I was a kid.

27:26.187 --> 27:29.274
Everything was hard for me.

27:31.860 --> 27:35.322
I didn't go out that much,
and when I did,

27:37.782 --> 27:42.746
I had panic attacks,
like, physical pain.

27:42.871 --> 27:46.583
You know, it was, like, worse,
it was like I was dying.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.336
When I met Angela,

27:50.086 --> 27:53.089
she was the only reason

27:54.132 --> 27:56.301
that I ever
wanted to go out.

27:58.386 --> 28:01.097
But then she died, and...

28:03.725 --> 28:05.602
(HEAVING)

28:14.778 --> 28:16.613
Blood test
will be done soon.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.830
I'm guessing
that's a new technique.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.957
Hey, do you remember
that idea that Cameron had

28:28.083 --> 28:30.627
about trying to torture the patient
into admitting himself?

28:30.752 --> 28:32.545
Pretty sure
it was your idea.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.172
You want me
to slow down the test?

28:34.297 --> 28:37.592
Wow, everyone's got
all these great ideas today.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.804
So you're thinking, "Patient won't leave
because leaving causes pain,

28:40.929 --> 28:42.347
"so we gotta make
staying more painful."

28:42.472 --> 28:43.598
That actually makes sense.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.101
You'll increase his pain,
but not enough to make a difference.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.185
He's on morphine.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.561
He's on morphine now,

28:48.686 --> 28:50.897
pretty soon,
he'll be on lessphine.

28:51.022 --> 28:55.485
'Cause when you restock, you'll actually
be giving Cameron IV bags of saline.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.237
And why do you think
I'll be doing this?

28:57.362 --> 28:58.446
Same reason
you did the surgery.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.490
That was because
it was an emergency.

29:00.615 --> 29:04.369
No, it was because
your marriage is falling apart.

29:05.537 --> 29:09.499
When you confess adultery,
things tend to go bad.

29:09.624 --> 29:13.086
When one part of your life
does a Titanic,

29:13.211 --> 29:15.422
you make a life raft
out of whatever's left,

29:15.547 --> 29:17.966
which makes your job more significant,
which is why you did the surgery,

29:18.091 --> 29:21.803
why you pulled an all-nighter,
and why you'll do this.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.807
She's having me
sleep on the couch,

29:25.932 --> 29:27.475
just for a few nights.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.229
I'm not doing this to save my job.
I'm doing this to save his life.

29:31.354 --> 29:34.315
Right.
That's what we'll tell everyone.

Oh, you mean Cuddy.

Yeah, she's a little nuts,
but she's beautiful, smart, funny.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.830
And most important,
she can stand you.

31:12.956 --> 31:16.125
Yeah. I came here
to have you lecture me on Cuddy,

31:16.251 --> 31:19.128
not because there's a killer mosquito
chasing me around my apartment.

31:19.254 --> 31:21.422
House,
there is no mosquito.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.800
This is all about Cuddy.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.719
She's "bugging" me.
Poetic.

31:26.844 --> 31:28.555
Have you seen this bug?

31:28.680 --> 31:29.764
Have you seen this bite?

No, what I've seen
is a suppurating wound

that you've scratched and mutilated
into a gangrenous state.

I am not imagining things.

House, you're a drug addict,
you're always imagining things.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.113
You got bitten
the night you kissed her.

31:45.238 --> 31:48.283
Your itching always gets worse
when you think about her.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.118
You need to address this.

31:50.243 --> 31:51.202
She's my boss.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.121
No, you're not afraid of authority,

31:53.246 --> 31:55.999
you're afraid
she actually is right for you.

31:56.124 --> 31:57.125
You're afraid
to take a chance

31:57.250 --> 31:58.835
because ifs
too big a chance.

31:59.252 --> 32:02.088
If it doesn't work with her,
then maybe there's no one out there.

32:03.381 --> 32:07.218
I am not rationalizing.
I'm better off alone.

32:08.136 --> 32:09.929
Also, have you seen
her ass recently?

32:10.054 --> 32:11.055
You're not staying here.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.056
Oh, come on.

32:12.181 --> 32:16.561
No.
You can go home, or...

32:17.645 --> 32:20.648
You're going to Cuddy's,
you're gonna ring her doorbell,

32:20.773 --> 32:24.611
and you're gonna ask her out on a date,
like regular people do.

32:24.736 --> 32:26.321

House, if we don't restart his heart...

We can get him to the hospital in five.

to actually resuscitate dying people,

- not just let them flop around.
- Could be lymphoma.

in the front entry.

a bouquet a day,

34:21.269 --> 34:22.186
- he couldn't...
- How clean?

34:22.311 --> 34:24.605

has a little OCD.

do you wash your tub?

- Bleach and ammonia?
- Yeah.

play toy soldiers in the bath?

pacemaker's gonna fail eventually,

and I don't have the skills
to put in a permanent one.

hasn't completely shot his heart,

and you won't have to feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

isn't precise enough?

to be angry at me.

at my house?

Because when we
spent them at yours,

36:05.540 --> 36:07.834
I could tell you
didn't want me there.

36:45.329 --> 36:48.082
but I can't keep
chasing you forever.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.595
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

37:05.182 --> 37:06.893
I just tried your house,
where are you?

37:07.018 --> 37:09.312
Clubbing.
Good or bad?

37:09.437 --> 37:12.273
Bad. Vitals are dropping,
the abdominal pain keeps getting worse.

37:14.525 --> 37:16.819
Means we were too late
with the treatment.

37:17.737 --> 37:20.531
Tell the lawyer he's off the clock,
we're done.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.199
You're giving up?

37:22.325 --> 37:23.618
Call Taub.

37:23.743 --> 37:28.080
Tell him to pick up some morphine.
No need for the patient to be in pain.

37:28.205 --> 37:31.375
- He's on morphine.
- No, he's on saline.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.879
I figured you'd put him on saline,
so I switched him back to morphine.

37:35.004 --> 37:38.341
I love you.
When you reach puberty, give me a...

37:41.844 --> 37:44.597
His abdominal pain,
that was on morphine?

37:44.722 --> 37:46.140
Yes.

37:51.187 --> 37:52.563
<i>Is there something
that causes abdominal pain</i>

37:52.688 --> 37:55.191
<i>that doesn't respond to morphine?</i>

37:57.026 --> 38:00.529
I was right.
He is being poisoned.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.999
What's this density
on his hip?

38:13.084 --> 38:17.338
- Just bone.
- Think less boney.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.009
You think
he's got lead poisoning?

38:22.134 --> 38:27.682
Explains the constipation,
the nerves, seizures. Hold him down.

38:30.351 --> 38:35.231
You're not gonna feel a thing,
except excruciating pain.

38:50.037 --> 38:54.792
Your mugger used hollow points,
which exploded and left fragments.

38:54.917 --> 38:57.920
<i>Your doctors missed a couple
hiding behind your hipbone.</i>

38:58.045 --> 39:02.174
<i>It's no biggie, except years later,
they started to dissolve,</i>

39:02.299 --> 39:06.095
and then, biggie,
you started to dissolve.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.557
I'll start him on chelation.
The agoraphobia, could it...

39:09.682 --> 39:13.144
Nope. The lead wouldn't have started
to disintegrate till years after.

39:13.269 --> 39:14.812
But it could have
exacerbated the fear.

39:14.937 --> 39:16.355
I don't need to change.

39:16.480 --> 39:21.485
I know you think that but your life
could be better, you'd have choices.

39:21.610 --> 39:24.238
- He's lying.
- About what?

39:25.239 --> 39:27.658
About everything.
About his life.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.662
He doesn't even think he's happy here.
He's miserable.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.873
- I've got everything I need.
- Yeah?

39:33.998 --> 39:38.169
Well, then why did Taub find
rose petals in your entry hallway?

39:38.294 --> 39:41.756
Struck me as a little weird,
thought it might be medically relevant.

39:41.881 --> 39:44.175
But it actually just told me
that you were pathetic.

39:44.300 --> 39:49.930
The day you crashed in your entryway
was your girlfriend's birthday.

39:50.681 --> 39:56.312
You weren't there for the mail, you were
trying to go lay flowers on her grave.

39:58.814 --> 40:02.902
Yeah, he's got PTSD,
yeah, he's agoraphobic.

40:03.027 --> 40:04.278
But he's also a coward.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.947
If you want to change your life,
do something.

40:07.073 --> 40:09.158
Don't believe
your own rationalizations.

40:09.283 --> 40:12.369
Don't just lock yourself up
and pretend you're happy.

40:26.175 --> 40:28.469
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.098
You were right.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.226
About my husband.
It affected me.

40:37.812 --> 40:40.314
It still affects me.

40:41.649 --> 40:43.484
If you're saying
you'll never be able to...

40:43.609 --> 40:46.112
I cleaned out
a drawer for you.

40:49.657 --> 40:51.700
Like, a big one.
