FOREIGN ACTIVISM: A REASON
FOR CONTROVERSY IN MEXICO

01:16.530 --> 01:18.530
{\an8}Several years ago, in Mexico,
a significant number

01:18.620 --> 01:20.990
{\an8}of foreign journalists and activists
moved into our country.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.580
{\an8}Some local groups have shown
hostility towards the activities

01:23.660 --> 01:25.960
{\an8}that these new visitors are carrying out.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.540
{\an8}Fiona Gaertner, an English activist
and wife of U.S. journalist Leam Gaertner,

01:28.630 --> 01:29.710
{\an8}was among the victims.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.800
{\an8}The Gaertners met in Puebla
and later they moved to Mexico City,

01:31.880 --> 01:33.420
{\an8}where their children
Nico and Sebastián were born.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.510
{\an8}As they were still young children, the...

"Closed"

02:03.870 --> 02:06.300
How did you get in, Sebastian?

02:16.980 --> 02:20.050
<i>My name is Nico.</i>
<i>I'm a journalist.</i>

02:20.090 --> 02:21.820
<i>At least, I'm trying to be.</i>

02:21.850 --> 02:23.790
<i>But here I am again
at 5:00 in the morning</i>

02:23.820 --> 02:25.590
<i>in my rented studio
in Puebla,</i>

02:25.630 --> 02:28.190
<i>not sleeping and not
writing a single paragraph.</i>

02:28.230 --> 02:30.160
<i>I think of everything,
obsessively,</i>

02:30.200 --> 02:31.530
<i>except the article
I have to write.</i>

02:32.900 --> 02:34.670
<i>This is how my story began.</i>

02:34.700 --> 02:37.870
<i>Coming back.
From England to Mexico.</i>

02:37.900 --> 02:40.470
<i>I was just 17 when I came here,
alone,</i>

02:40.510 --> 02:42.370
<i>dying to finally see the
gigantic city</i>

02:42.410 --> 02:46.650
<i>where my mother
said I was born: Mexico City.</i>

02:46.680 --> 02:49.280
<i>I've been a bundle
of contradictions ever since.</i>

02:49.310 --> 02:51.850
<i>At 17, I was still a sad kid,</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:55.220
<i>a little arrogant, maybe,
but also awkward.</i>

02:55.250 --> 02:58.490
<i>Now I spend my days walking,
looking at everything,</i>

02:58.520 --> 03:01.490
<i>turning over rocks,
trying to write a good story.</i>

03:01.530 --> 03:05.300
<i>For me, London reemerges
everywhere I look in Mexico.</i>

03:05.850 --> 03:07.560
<i>As Martín Caparrós says,</i>

03:07.640 --> 03:11.810
<i>"We arrive, carrying what we think
we are going to see from somewhere else."</i>

03:11.900 --> 03:13.845
<i>Like the old Chroniclers
of the Indies, right?</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:17.080
<i>I live here in Puebla,</i>

03:17.110 --> 03:19.480
<i>and I travel to Mexico City
once a week to work,</i>

03:19.510 --> 03:22.310
<i>so I get the best of both
worlds: beautiful Puebla,</i>

03:22.350 --> 03:25.350

03:25.380 --> 03:27.320

to land a job.</i>

"Mexico City and the Global City"

03:31.710 --> 03:34.290
By Nico Gaertner

03:34.380 --> 03:39.510
The 21st century
is characterized by a growing...

03:40.590 --> 03:44.760
a growing movement of trans...

04:11.700 --> 04:14.270
<i>I'm from here.
I was born here.</i>

04:14.300 --> 04:16.470
<i>Hm, how ironic.</i>

04:16.500 --> 04:19.110
<i>I could've stayed in London,
but for what?</i>

04:19.140 --> 04:20.740
<i>They wouldn't even
let me see my mother.</i>

04:20.769 --> 04:23.280
<i>What kind of person does
that to a 16-year-old?</i>

04:24.640 --> 04:27.880
<i>I'm a hybrid, thinking
in English and Spanish,</i>

04:27.910 --> 04:31.120
<i>a product of development
and underdevelopment,</i>

04:31.150 --> 04:35.290
<i>sometimes coherent,
but usually incoherent.</i>

04:35.320 --> 04:37.720
<i>And then... there's Monica.</i>

04:40.330 --> 04:42.230
<i>Monica is Chilean.</i>

04:42.260 --> 04:44.230
<i>I met her studying journalism
in Puebla,</i>

04:44.260 --> 04:45.670
<i>and she is the best thing
that's happened to me</i>

04:45.700 --> 04:48.130
<i>since I came here.</i>

04:48.170 --> 04:51.940
<i>But like all dreams, love is
subject to brutal awakenings</i>

04:51.970 --> 04:55.840
<i>into silence, fear,
a lack of something more.</i>

06:23.090 --> 06:27.260
When we say that the megacities are

06:29.300 --> 06:32.470
When we say that all megacities

06:32.550 --> 06:35.640
are starting to resemble each other...

06:45.220 --> 06:46.931
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Fuck!</i>

06:46.974 --> 06:49.617
<i>You're fucking kidding me!
Is this a joke? I can't write anything!</i>

07:04.700 --> 07:07.170
<i>Not this guy in the hat
who's always staring.</i>

07:08.840 --> 07:11.740
<i>I guess it's only fair.
I deserve some payback</i>

07:11.780 --> 07:13.850
<i>for sticking my nose
into other people's lives.</i>

07:24.310 --> 07:25.480
<i>Hello?</i>

07:25.570 --> 07:28.440
I dropped by your house yesterday,
but no one answered the door.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.030
<i>You really came?</i>

07:30.110 --> 07:32.320
Yes, I came by around 3 p.m.

07:34.070 --> 07:38.080
<i>Can you call me later?
I'm kind of busy.</i>

07:38.160 --> 07:40.500
-Okay.
<i>-Cool.</i>

07:40.580 --> 07:42.790
-Okay, later.
<i>-Okay.</i>

07:56.180 --> 07:57.680
<i>Nico... look...</i>

07:57.760 --> 08:01.690
<i>I know you came, but...
you've got me so annoyed!</i>

08:01.770 --> 08:03.270
<i>Nothing flows right with you.</i>

08:03.350 --> 08:06.730
<i>You might want to go on like this,
but what about everyone else?</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:10.110
<i>I came from Chile to study here,
to feel good,</i>

08:10.190 --> 08:13.570
<i>and then I wind up involved with you,
the weirdest guy out there.</i>

08:13.660 --> 08:17.280
<i>You should go back to London,
or the U.S., or, I don't know.</i>

08:17.370 --> 08:19.120
<i>Do as you please.</i>

08:19.200 --> 08:21.330
<i>Nico, don't come back.</i>

08:24.350 --> 08:27.550
<i>And that's how Monica</i>
<i>disappeared from my life.</i>

08:27.590 --> 08:29.560
<i>She got sick of me,
simple as that.</i>

08:31.290 --> 08:34.990
<i>She'll go back to Chile after
she's finished studying here.</i>

08:35.030 --> 08:39.330
<i>I'm sure she'll do well,
unlike my mother.</i>

08:39.370 --> 08:42.740
<i>What happened to my mother
could never happen to Monica.</i>

08:42.770 --> 08:44.140
<i>What could be worse
than ending up</i>

08:44.169 --> 08:46.240
<i>in a mental institution
in London,</i>

08:46.270 --> 08:48.010
<i>the cold city of London,</i>

08:48.040 --> 08:51.780
<i>with its cold streets and
its equally cold psychiatrists.</i>

08:54.780 --> 08:56.650
<i>Monica.</i>

08:56.680 --> 08:59.490
<i>Monica always seems to find
the story that needs telling,</i>

08:59.520 --> 09:01.560
<i>those particular angles
I always miss.</i>

09:01.590 --> 09:04.260
<i>She says Chile is an island
with only seven faces,</i>

09:04.290 --> 09:05.860
<i>and hers is one of them.</i>

09:05.890 --> 09:07.160
<i>I think she got that
from reading</i>

09:07.190 --> 09:08.903
<i>about the films of Raul Ruiz.</i>

09:08.946 --> 09:10.840
<i>...and the last Thursday of every month.
We'll be waiting for you!</i>

09:14.550 --> 09:18.260
<i>The people of Puebla shouldn't worry
too much about safety in their state.</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:22.980
<i>With the "Safe Puebla" plan, we will
install more security cameras and lights</i>

09:23.060 --> 09:27.230
<i>to cut danger and crime.</i>

09:27.310 --> 09:30.070
<i>...all night long, three-dollar drinks
all night long.</i>

09:30.150 --> 09:32.847
<i>Contest Thursdays in Rancho Oklahoma City.
We'll be waiting for you!</i>

09:33.940 --> 09:35.110
<i>...see you there...</i>

09:35.690 --> 09:37.860
<i>...Grateful</i>
<i>to God that he allowed me</i>

09:37.890 --> 09:40.590
<i>to be born in
the United States of America.</i>

09:40.630 --> 09:44.660
<i>I love this country.
I love this country! And...</i>

10:03.350 --> 10:05.590
<i>Beginning at 9:00 a.m.,</i>

10:05.620 --> 10:07.220
<i>when the new President gives his inaugural speech...</i>

10:07.250 --> 10:08.920
<i>Members of congress
talk about...</i>

10:08.950 --> 10:10.090
Hello?

10:10.120 --> 10:11.590
<i>Hi, where are you?</i>

10:11.630 --> 10:13.590
Hey, I'm still
in Oklahoma.

10:13.630 --> 10:15.130
<i>You're still here?</i>
<i>Why?</i>

10:15.160 --> 10:16.830
I told you
I was gonna go follow

10:16.860 --> 10:19.130
in my parents' footsteps
and took some back roads.

10:19.170 --> 10:21.670
I can't find anything
to listen to out here.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.570
<i>Babe, you can't follow</i>
<i>in your parents' footsteps.</i>

10:23.600 --> 10:25.300
<i>They travelled 20 years ago.</i>

10:25.340 --> 10:27.970
- I know, but I can try.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:28.010 --> 10:30.440
And then,
another 10 hours to Mexico.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.980
But hey, I'm driving.
I'll send you a message later?

10:34.610 --> 10:36.520
<i>Okay, I love you.</i>

10:36.550 --> 10:37.850
Love you.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.907
<i>...will be performing at the inauguration
of the new president...</i>

10:41.921 --> 10:43.760
<i>This could mean that not all...</i>

10:44.590 --> 10:46.930
<i>...It's Marxism re-written</i>

10:46.960 --> 10:49.700
<i>and cut to fit a Black context.</i>

10:51.190 --> 10:53.177
<i>Hey, I know you're busy, but...</i>

10:53.231 --> 10:55.000
<i>...With</i>
<i>the baptism of the holy spirit,</i>

10:55.030 --> 10:56.700
<i>evidence shows
they were speaking in...</i>

10:58.700 --> 11:00.610
<i>Criticized</i>
<i>by the president elect,</i>

11:00.640 --> 11:02.810
<i>who called climate change
a hoax.</i>

11:02.840 --> 11:05.210
<i>I do not believe that</i>
<i>climate change is a hoax.</i>

11:05.240 --> 11:08.110
<i>Okay, that's important</i>
<i>for the president to hear.</i>

11:08.150 --> 11:09.180
<i>Taking it further,</i>
<i>Johnson told Ferris that if...</i>

11:10.680 --> 11:12.120
<i>My country is falling apart,</i>

11:12.150 --> 11:14.650
<i>and here I am heading
south to Mexico.</i>

11:14.690 --> 11:16.990
<i>What if they build that
damn wall while I am there?</i>

11:17.020 --> 11:19.330
<i>It could be for the best,
really.</i>

11:19.360 --> 11:21.960
<i>Maybe staying in that country
that I don't even know</i>

11:21.990 --> 11:23.300
<i>is just what I need.</i>

12:12.480 --> 12:14.080
<i>Dad,</i>
<i>I am on my way to Mexico,</i>

12:14.110 --> 12:17.180
<i>wondering what made you
and mom settle there.</i>

12:17.220 --> 12:19.520
<i>It's ridiculous
that I'm Mexican!</i>

12:19.550 --> 12:21.220
<i>It's ridiculous that you insist</i>

12:21.250 --> 12:25.060
<i>that my name has
a written accent over the á .</i>

12:25.090 --> 12:28.030
<i>If you only would've had
the decency of telling me more</i>

12:28.060 --> 12:29.760
<i>and not just focus on that,</i>

12:29.800 --> 12:32.430
<i>with your bizarre jokes,
honestly.</i>

12:54.150 --> 12:56.290
<i>What if I was to say
to my brother:</i>

12:56.320 --> 12:59.860
<i>"Nico, I started a letter
for you, but...</i>

12:59.890 --> 13:02.230
<i>"I... I don't know what to say.
I'm so torn.</i>

13:02.260 --> 13:04.260
<i>How will I approach you
when I get to Mexico City?"</i>

13:04.300 --> 13:06.770
<i>I don't know. I feel that
that's a little too dramatic.</i>

13:06.800 --> 13:08.670
<i>Why don't you just say,</i>

13:08.700 --> 13:11.840
<i>"Hey, this is your brother
Sebastian from Oklahoma?"</i>

13:12.840 --> 13:14.470
<i>Okay, that won't work.</i>

13:14.510 --> 13:16.310
<i>Uh, you could just say,
"What's up jerk?"</i>

13:16.340 --> 13:18.580
Sure, I could say that.

13:18.610 --> 13:20.610
<i>Or I don't know,</i>
<i>just show up at his work.</i>

13:20.650 --> 13:22.410
<i>What is it?</i>
Joint Visions?

13:22.450 --> 13:23.950
Yeah, that's where he works.

13:23.980 --> 13:25.690
That was the only thing
I was able to find online.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.790
I mean, <i>for sure.</i>

13:27.820 --> 13:31.020
<i>Wow, and now you're
on your way to Mexico City.</i>

13:31.060 --> 13:32.590
<i>Does your dad know?</i>

13:32.630 --> 13:34.260
No, I went
to his house this morning,

13:34.290 --> 13:38.160
and of course, he was there
gloomy and mean, as usual.

13:38.930 --> 13:40.400
Uh, can you please just look up

13:40.430 --> 13:42.100
the address
for <i>Joint Visions</i> again?

13:42.130 --> 13:45.100
<i>Yeah, sure, um,
I actually have it right here.</i>

13:45.140 --> 13:49.710
<i>It's on Avenida Juarez
and Revilla...?</i>

13:49.740 --> 13:53.450
<i>How do you say that?
Um, Revillagigedo?</i>

13:59.080 --> 14:00.710
{\an8}<i>This city drags us along.</i>

14:00.790 --> 14:04.340
{\an8}<i>It grows like an animal deformed
by some unknown drug.</i>

14:04.420 --> 14:05.970
{\an8}<i>With no mold, no plan.</i>

14:06.050 --> 14:09.550
{\an8}<i>Like a chain of lights, cars,
and buildings.</i>

14:09.640 --> 14:13.640
{\an8}<i>It is monstrous and beautiful all at once.
But what isn't beautiful in...</i>

14:13.720 --> 14:15.770
<i>What's this guy's problem?</i>

14:15.850 --> 14:17.270
<i>Lost something?</i>

14:17.313 --> 14:18.340
<i>I've got to get back to Puebla.</i>

14:18.370 --> 14:21.640
<i>I get so paranoid here
in el D.F.</i>

14:21.670 --> 14:24.980
<i>or Mexico City, or CDMX,</i>

14:25.010 --> 14:26.980
<i>or whatever
they want to call it next.</i>

14:42.530 --> 14:44.700
<i>In the</i> Rear Window,
<i>Jefferies also spied</i>

14:44.730 --> 14:47.770
<i>on his front neighbors,
or did he?</i>

14:47.800 --> 14:50.740
<i>In Hitchcock's film,
Jefferies was a photographer</i>

14:50.770 --> 14:53.540
<i>whose life was paused
because of a broken leg.</i>

14:53.570 --> 14:55.880
<i>I'm more like some
disturbed voyeur,</i>

14:55.910 --> 14:57.440
<i>digging into people's lives</i>

14:57.480 --> 14:59.850
<i>thanks to lack of sleep
and a mental block.</i>

14:59.880 --> 15:02.620
<i>Or in order to turn
my back on my own,</i>

15:02.650 --> 15:03.683
let's say...

15:03.726 --> 15:05.820
<i>"Private Miseries."</i>

15:06.550 --> 15:08.790
<i>That's what my favorite writer,
Leila Guerriero,</i>

15:08.820 --> 15:11.360
<i>would call the things
inside these four walls:</i>

15:11.390 --> 15:15.230
<i>a chair, a table,
a kitchen (inside a closet, )</i>

15:15.260 --> 15:18.130
a bed, and random piles
of books and clothes.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.200
<i>Oh, and the cat of course,</i>

15:20.230 --> 15:22.230
<i>but she is far
from a private misery.</i>

15:23.770 --> 15:25.270
<i>What if I sorted out
all my clothes</i>

15:25.300 --> 15:27.870
<i>in my kitchen drawers
like Slavoj Zizek?</i>

15:27.910 --> 15:30.940
<i>He says it adds
something special to his life.</i>

15:32.950 --> 15:34.980
<i>The Hitchcockian characters
across the street</i>

15:35.010 --> 15:37.220
<i>seem to live normal lives.</i>

15:37.250 --> 15:39.620
<i>I hope no one sees me
and decides to say hello.</i>

15:39.650 --> 15:41.990
<i>I can't hold
a normal conversation.</i>

15:46.490 --> 15:48.260
<i>Here I am again at 5:00
in the morning,</i>

15:48.290 --> 15:50.900
<i>not sleeping and not
writing a single paragraph.</i>

16:19.120 --> 16:22.860
<i>What if I wrote about that
building and the people in it?</i>

16:22.900 --> 16:25.630
<i>I could start with that kid,
staring into space,</i>

16:25.670 --> 16:28.200
<i>looking for something
in the stratosphere.</i>

16:28.230 --> 16:30.700
That could be the start
of a beautiful story.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.620
<i>We walk, we move,</i>
<i>but we never leave home.</i>

16:47.650 --> 16:49.150
<i>This watch is the same one
I asked my mum</i>

16:49.190 --> 16:51.790
<i>to buy for me in London,
a long time ago.</i>

17:13.680 --> 17:15.880
<i>Leila Guerreiro</i>
<i>quotes Rafael Gumucio</i>

17:15.920 --> 17:17.980
<i>from</i> Against Flaubert.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.690
<i>For Flaubert, he says,</i>

17:19.720 --> 17:22.859
<i>Madame Bovary is a vengeance
against her father,</i>

17:22.890 --> 17:26.530
<i>against her uncles, against
the entire city of Ruan,</i>

17:26.560 --> 17:30.360
<i>against books, against nuns,
against Republicans...</i>

17:30.400 --> 17:32.870
<i>almost against everything.</i>

17:32.900 --> 17:36.070
<i>The argument is unsettling
to me, but also intriguing,</i>

17:36.100 --> 17:38.000
<i>like so many others
from Gumucio,</i>

17:38.040 --> 17:41.010
<i>or Leila, or Caparrós,
or Villoro,</i>

17:41.040 --> 17:43.310
<i>or Cadena Martínez,
who I read obsessively.</i>

17:43.770 --> 17:45.600
Hey Nico! How are things?

17:46.310 --> 17:48.980
Pretty good. Well... trying to write.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.860
And you're studying
there in Puebla, right?

17:52.940 --> 17:55.530
I already got a job.
In Mexico City.

17:55.610 --> 17:56.860
Okay, I read what you sent me.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.780
It's pretty good,
but I can tell you are...

17:58.870 --> 18:00.530
tense, stiff.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.420
What's up with that?

18:06.500 --> 18:08.380
You have to tell that story
with a little more...

18:08.460 --> 18:09.920
tenderness.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.510
Tenderness?!

18:13.590 --> 18:14.590
What do you do all day long?

18:14.670 --> 18:15.630
I walk.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.130
But, what else?

18:17.220 --> 18:19.600
Not much more.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.470
I suggest...

18:24.560 --> 18:26.390
you take a chill pill!

18:27.390 --> 18:30.520
You want to write?
Let your hair down, Nico!

18:30.563 --> 18:32.060
Ugh.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.530
Stop pulling your hair out when writing!

18:59.020 --> 19:00.850
<i>Today was a good day.</i>

19:03.320 --> 19:04.760
<i>I wasn't able
to start the story</i>

19:04.790 --> 19:06.290
<i>of the kid staring into space,</i>

19:06.320 --> 19:09.160
<i>but something supernatural
did happen.</i>

19:09.190 --> 19:11.960
<i>I finally spoke to Alberto
Cadena Martínez,</i>

19:12.000 --> 19:13.300
<i>all the way from Colombia.</i>

19:13.320 --> 19:14.820
<i>Brilliant!</i>

19:14.900 --> 19:17.150
<i>That really is supernatural.</i>

19:21.240 --> 19:22.610
<i>He called me out though.</i>

19:22.640 --> 19:25.980
<i>Hm, "me retó,"
as Monica would say.</i>

19:26.010 --> 19:28.610
<i>Good thing too, since
I have such writer's block.</i>

19:32.090 --> 19:34.190
<i>Alberto says the key
to writing a good story</i>

19:34.220 --> 19:36.190
<i>is a particular
point of view,</i>

19:36.220 --> 19:38.590
<i>which doesn't just magically
emerge out of research,</i>

19:38.620 --> 19:40.560
<i>out of what I've been doing.</i>

19:40.590 --> 19:42.230
<i>I do fuck all.</i>

19:42.260 --> 19:44.630
<i>I walk around not even
knowing what to look for.</i>

19:44.660 --> 19:48.470
<i>But they say that can be an
advantage for good writers too.</i>

19:48.500 --> 19:50.300
<i>The truth is,
my effort at this story</i>

19:50.340 --> 19:52.340
<i>has become like a tornado
sweeping me along.</i>

19:53.410 --> 19:54.940
<i>Like in Oklahoma.</i>

20:06.740 --> 20:07.907
<i>321?</i>

20:10.080 --> 20:11.830
<i>What is 321?</i>

20:12.260 --> 20:13.890
<i>You're right, Alberto.</i>

20:13.930 --> 20:15.330
<i>I've got to put an end
to this neurosis</i>

20:15.360 --> 20:17.700
<i>and think... think calmly.</i>

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
- Good day.
- Yeah.

21:27.030 --> 21:28.330
The usual?

21:28.370 --> 21:29.570
Yeah.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.380
<i>Salud.</i>

21:44.320 --> 21:46.380
Oh, are you from Mexico?

21:47.490 --> 21:49.090
Do I look Mexican?

21:51.120 --> 21:53.030
He says that all the time.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.230
Why?

21:55.390 --> 21:58.100
He used to live in Mexico
for the longest time.

21:58.830 --> 22:00.670
That's why he comes in here.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.840
The music.

22:15.550 --> 22:16.980
Hey, Leam.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.580
How goes it?

22:22.490 --> 22:25.520
I liked it better when Luis
played the old Mexican tunes.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.660
Get him to play
the old Mexican songs.

22:27.690 --> 22:31.860
I'm with you on that.
I'll take your recommendation.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.550
<i>What inhabits</i>
<i>this burning red earth?</i>

22:52.590 --> 22:55.520
<i>Is it abundance,
or the vastness of a desert</i>

22:55.550 --> 22:59.030
<i>plagued by churches,
oil, and highways</i>

22:59.060 --> 23:01.890
<i>that leads to an obscure border</i>

23:01.930 --> 23:03.830
<i>like a blind, mad animal</i>

23:03.860 --> 23:06.700
<i>that crashes into a wall
it cannot see?</i>

23:06.730 --> 23:09.500
<i>The wind blows,
and we are far away,</i>

23:09.530 --> 23:11.870
<i>and every border reminds us</i>

23:11.900 --> 23:15.270
<i>that we cross it only when
we're searching for something;</i>

23:15.310 --> 23:19.410
<i>otherwise, every cage looks
brilliantly tidy and clean,</i>

23:19.440 --> 23:22.080
<i>like this one,
where I find myself.</i>

24:27.680 --> 24:30.150
Are you hanging out
or drinking or eating or...?

24:31.320 --> 24:33.320
I'll be back
in a minute for you.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.140
<i>Nico.</i>

24:58.180 --> 25:00.850
<i>I've been unable
to write you a normal letter.</i>

25:00.880 --> 25:02.180
<i>So...</i>

25:02.210 --> 25:04.050
<i>Here's what I really wanna say.</i>

25:04.080 --> 25:07.020
<i>When I found out that you,
Rose, and mom were gone,</i>

25:07.050 --> 25:09.220
<i>all I could do was imagine
where you were.</i>

25:09.260 --> 25:11.660
<i>I spent hours looking
in those geography magazines</i>

25:11.690 --> 25:14.460
<i>that mom brought home
from England.</i>

25:14.490 --> 25:16.000
<i>I was looking
for you guys in them.</i>

25:18.530 --> 25:20.670
<i>Remember that feeling we had</i>

25:20.700 --> 25:24.370
<i>that nothing would happen to us
as long as dad was around?</i>

25:24.400 --> 25:27.170
<i>Well, now he</i> was
<i>the only one around,</i>

25:27.210 --> 25:30.780
<i>but I was six, and he had
shut off completely.</i>

25:30.810 --> 25:35.750
<i>I don't know anything about you
or if mom is in Mexico.</i>

25:35.780 --> 25:38.050
<i>But at least I know
where you are.</i>

25:38.080 --> 25:40.120
<i>I'll find you guys.</i>

25:40.150 --> 25:42.820
<i>I can't wait to get down there,
especially now.</i>

25:42.860 --> 25:44.720
<i>Have you seen
what's happening in the US?</i>

25:44.760 --> 25:47.430
<i>Maybe you can get me
a job down there.</i>

25:54.630 --> 25:57.740
<i>I also know that Latin American
cities are gigantic,</i>

25:57.770 --> 26:01.240
<i>one of them being Mexico City,
where I'm headed to find you.</i>

26:11.120 --> 26:17.260
<i>Instead, Ava, our Oklahoma town
is very, let's say, lonely.</i>

26:17.290 --> 26:20.230
<i>In Ava, you don't see
many people walking,</i>

26:20.260 --> 26:23.100
<i>except those loners that
traverse endless pathways</i>

26:23.130 --> 26:26.930
<i>seemingly going from one fast
food joint to a dollar store.</i>

26:26.970 --> 26:30.470
<i>And while shiny cars drive
through town anonymously,</i>

26:30.500 --> 26:33.140
<i>other lonely people hit
one bar after the other.</i>

26:34.410 --> 26:37.880
<i>I might sound dramatic,
but this is what I see.</i>

26:37.910 --> 26:39.710
<i>One of those people
that hits those bars</i>

26:39.750 --> 26:42.350
<i>during the day
is our father, Leam.</i>

27:29.800 --> 27:32.160
<i>...Drug lord</i>
<i>is now in U.S. custody</i>

27:32.200 --> 27:33.169
<i>facing several charges...</i>

27:33.212 --> 27:35.597
<i>Today began the trial in the case
of the motorcyclist</i>

27:36.522 --> 27:38.530
<i>who drove into a police station
in Laredo.</i>

27:38.610 --> 27:40.200
<i>The trial will take place...</i>

28:19.410 --> 28:20.780
<i>Your call has been forwarded...</i>

29:03.260 --> 29:05.290
<i>...The storm</i>
<i>initiated the conformation</i>

29:05.320 --> 29:07.290
<i>of a tornado
that most likely will pass</i>

29:07.330 --> 29:09.760
<i>near the city of Moore
in the State of Oklahoma.</i>

29:09.800 --> 29:11.400
<i>Residents are already
taking the necessary...</i>

30:42.550 --> 30:47.010
{\an8}Federal Highway 85
Mexico

30:56.670 --> 30:59.570
<i>On the other side,</i>
<i>everything sparkles,</i>

30:59.610 --> 31:02.580
<i>bathed in a light
that blinds our eyes.</i>

31:02.610 --> 31:06.380
<i>The lines curve,
the roads become irregular,</i>

31:06.410 --> 31:09.420
<i>nature is wild and alive.</i>

31:09.450 --> 31:11.950
<i>Like a party
with no written end.</i>

31:12.950 --> 31:15.920
<i>Like an impossible
and mysterious world.</i>

31:38.910 --> 31:40.450
<i>Why did I decide to write</i>

31:40.480 --> 31:42.720
<i>about the world now,
of all times,</i>

31:42.750 --> 31:45.180
<i>right at the start of the
Post-Truth age...</i>

31:45.220 --> 31:48.120
<i>hm... like Villoro said
in his talk on Tuesday.</i>

31:48.150 --> 31:49.420
<i>Puebla belongs to another time.</i>

31:50.790 --> 31:52.360
<i>It's like a Parisian
city-scape,</i>

31:52.390 --> 31:53.890
<i>frozen in time,</i>

31:53.930 --> 31:55.760
<i>the cover of Benjamin's</i>
Arcade Project,

31:55.800 --> 31:57.060
<i>but in Mexico.</i>

31:58.000 --> 31:59.410
Re-thinking Benjamin
in the context of Latin America

31:59.500 --> 32:00.261
{\an8}The Theorist of the Modern City.
Berlin, Paris, Naples.

32:00.304 --> 32:02.530
<i>There's no one
like Walter Benjamin.</i>

32:02.570 --> 32:06.570
<i>He's unique, original,
inexhaustible.</i>

32:06.610 --> 32:08.310
<i>And reading him does me good.</i>

32:08.340 --> 32:10.710
<i>I didn't know that the Parisian
arcades he describes</i>

32:10.740 --> 32:13.380
<i>are so much
like the ones here in Puebla.</i>

32:13.410 --> 32:16.880
<i>But these are tangled, baroque.</i>

32:16.920 --> 32:18.950
<i>Mexico is not the capital
of the world</i>

32:18.980 --> 32:20.720
<i>like Paris was
in the nineteenth century.</i>

32:22.090 --> 32:23.720
<i>But why would anyone
want to live</i>

32:23.760 --> 32:25.560
<i>in the center of the world,
anyway?</i>

32:35.660 --> 32:41.210
But why would anyone want to be
in the center of the world anyway?

32:47.210 --> 32:48.210
Here.

32:49.110 --> 32:51.580
<i>I'd love to be</i>
<i>like Benjamin, hm.</i>

32:51.620 --> 32:54.990
<i>To see the world
through these urban surfaces.</i>

32:55.020 --> 32:57.190
<i>Here in Puebla,
everything is exposed</i>

32:57.220 --> 33:00.330
<i>and concealed
at the same time.</i>

33:00.360 --> 33:04.730
<i>And here, in Mexico City,
even more.</i>

33:04.760 --> 33:08.000
<i>In this giant city,
there's no time for fiction.</i>

33:08.070 --> 33:11.540
<i>Anyone who's not wide-awake
gets lost, forever.</i>

33:18.450 --> 33:20.790
<i>To each their own.</i>

33:20.870 --> 33:23.000
<i>Did this guy lose something too?</i>

33:23.080 --> 33:25.710
<i>This is what's called
"The Paranoia of Loneliness."</i>

33:25.790 --> 33:27.790
Chiguagua, Gómez-Palacio, Cananéa.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.963
{\an8}Welcome, sir.
We can give you information.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.700
<i>My children, myself,</i>

33:43.740 --> 33:47.210
<i>are little more
than seeds adrift.</i>

33:47.240 --> 33:50.510
<i>My children, swept away
by the daily winds,</i>

33:50.540 --> 33:55.510
<i>ask themselves questions whose
meaning they've yet to know.</i>

33:55.550 --> 33:59.380
<i>One day, they'll stop, and all
the travelers you now see,</i>

33:59.420 --> 34:01.820
<i>passing other travelers
on foreign soil,</i>

34:01.850 --> 34:05.060
<i>at bus stations,
in the streets,</i>

34:05.090 --> 34:08.360
<i>will be the very proof that
what hurls us into the world</i>

34:08.389 --> 34:11.429
<i>is what also forces us
to endure, to return</i>

34:11.460 --> 34:13.500
<i>to the origin of all things</i>

34:13.530 --> 34:16.340
<i>when my seeds were newly
bursting with light,</i>

34:16.370 --> 34:19.239
<i>like a blameless
and brilliant gift.</i>

34:21.810 --> 34:26.770
<i>...58 to Mérida and Yucatán,
now completing boarding through door 18.</i>

34:26.850 --> 34:30.190
Hello... I'm a little lost,

34:30.270 --> 34:34.570
but I'm going to Mexico City.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.370
<i>...3700.</i>

34:41.449 --> 34:47.920
<i>Please head immediately
to door number 17.</i>

36:46.090 --> 36:49.390
You bribed him to play
my Mexican music, huh?

36:50.460 --> 36:52.760
Leam.

36:52.790 --> 36:54.660
So, are you a Brit?

36:55.600 --> 36:57.500
Last time, you asked me
if I was from Mexico.

36:57.530 --> 36:58.770
Yeah.

36:59.870 --> 37:01.600
No, I'm from Oklahoma.

37:01.630 --> 37:04.800
What I told you was last summer
I went to England, for school.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.780
Were you in London?

37:08.810 --> 37:10.880
Uh, yeah, for about a month.

37:10.910 --> 37:13.610
I was, like, drinking
a little too much.

37:13.650 --> 37:15.620
Um, why?
Why do you ask?

37:16.720 --> 37:18.420
Don't ask.

37:18.450 --> 37:21.420
It's just a question.
Why, Leam?

37:24.960 --> 37:26.130
What?

37:35.530 --> 37:37.470
<i>In the late sixties...</i>

37:38.270 --> 37:41.370
your dad became totally involved
in the movement of the day.

37:43.310 --> 37:48.350
And after the Tlatelolco
Massacre in Mexico...

37:50.420 --> 37:53.490
he kept going back,
returning to cover

37:53.520 --> 37:56.390
the student protests
against the government.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.460
Since he was persecuted here...

38:03.100 --> 38:05.970
He decided to stay there,
in Mexico.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
- He was about your age.
- I don't know...

38:12.040 --> 38:15.140
I know you don't know
much about all this.

38:15.170 --> 38:17.680
Everything your dad, Leam,

38:17.710 --> 38:21.950
struggled for in the sixties
and seventies.

38:23.680 --> 38:27.150
Everything he wrote
as a journalist was brilliant.

38:31.790 --> 38:34.390
And look at the world
today, Sebastian.

38:35.030 --> 38:40.830
It's been real hard for me
to witness your dad's downfall,

38:42.670 --> 38:44.270
when so much is happening...

38:46.210 --> 38:48.040
That needs to be analyzed,

38:48.070 --> 38:51.110
contested,

38:51.140 --> 38:52.950
with intelligence.

38:55.580 --> 38:56.880
Look!

39:05.560 --> 39:08.030
What's this catnip stuff?

39:08.060 --> 39:10.400
Ah, the catnip stuff.

39:10.430 --> 39:13.200
It may sound funny.

39:13.230 --> 39:15.530
Even catnip was an issue.

39:18.570 --> 39:23.540
But you know,
after he met your mom,

39:23.580 --> 39:26.080
your mother,

39:26.110 --> 39:28.310
their activism became stronger.

39:28.350 --> 39:30.480
<i>She was even tougher.</i>

39:30.520 --> 39:33.490
<i>Fiona... incredible woman.</i>

39:33.520 --> 39:36.220
<i>A short time after you
were born in Mexico,</i>

39:36.260 --> 39:38.260
<i>you and your brother, Nico,</i>

39:39.260 --> 39:40.990
<i>she was kidnapped.</i>

39:41.030 --> 39:43.400
How... how come my dad
never told me about this?

39:43.430 --> 39:45.400
Why are you telling me this?

39:49.770 --> 39:53.010
'Cause there has been
too much silence.

39:54.140 --> 39:56.940
We've been quiet for too long.

40:03.220 --> 40:05.080
When y'all came back
from Mexico in...

40:05.120 --> 40:08.190
'98. That's when Mom
was pregnant with Rose.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.590
In nine... yeah,
that'd be right.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.790
The nineties were difficult.
Very difficult in Mexico.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.630
They had no money,

40:19.000 --> 40:23.540
but at least they had a house
here... here in Oklahoma.

40:25.970 --> 40:28.610
And when they came back,

40:28.640 --> 40:30.980
everything seemed so great.

40:34.180 --> 40:37.280
You know, your brother, Nico...

40:37.320 --> 40:39.890
he loved that house,

40:39.920 --> 40:42.050
more so than you.

40:42.090 --> 40:43.890
Your dad...

40:46.460 --> 40:50.060
Seems him and little Nico
were like... like this, you know?

40:51.630 --> 40:53.830
They were always playing
at writing stories

40:53.870 --> 40:56.000
for the newspapers
up in the attic.

40:57.470 --> 40:59.010
Remember?

40:59.040 --> 41:00.370
No.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.840
But your parents would not stop,

41:04.880 --> 41:07.310
and vicious people
are everywhere.

41:08.710 --> 41:11.020
Leam, Fiona...

41:11.950 --> 41:14.990
did not have a chance
in Mexico, or even here.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.520
Why didn't she take me?

41:16.560 --> 41:19.130
Why did she only
take Rose and Nico?

41:19.160 --> 41:22.560
She did take Nico, Sebastian...

41:24.400 --> 41:27.100
but she didn't take Rose.

41:30.470 --> 41:33.370
They came back from Mexico

41:33.410 --> 41:35.780
because of that house.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.380
That house!

41:40.750 --> 41:41.710
What!?

41:51.190 --> 41:54.530
<i>It happened</i>
<i>on 321 Walnut Rd., in Ava.</i>

41:54.560 --> 41:57.800
<i>The victim has been identified
as 2-year old Rose Gaertner.</i>

41:57.830 --> 42:00.170
<i>Around 6 a.m.,
police responded to a call</i>

42:00.200 --> 42:02.700
<i>of people screaming
outside the Gaertner's home.</i>

42:02.740 --> 42:04.140
<i>When officers got to the scene,</i>

42:04.170 --> 42:06.470
<i>they found Rose lying
on the sidewalk.</i>

42:06.510 --> 42:08.410
<i>She died at the scene.</i>

42:08.440 --> 42:10.240
<i>...identified as 2-year
old Rose Gaertner...</i>

42:10.280 --> 42:12.310
<i>Screaming</i>
<i>outside... she died at the scene.</i>

42:12.340 --> 42:13.750
<i>The girl's parents have stated</i>

42:13.780 --> 42:15.210
<i>they were the target
of the assault.</i>

42:15.250 --> 42:16.650
<i>They fear the lack
of evidence...</i>

42:16.680 --> 42:17.920
<i>the lack of evidence
in the crime...</i>

44:09.940 --> 44:14.190
<i>...Porche model mattresses
are on sale from $220.</i>

44:14.270 --> 44:16.610
<i>Buy on credit for 15 monthly payments

44:16.690 --> 44:18.610

<i>Participate from now

44:30.330 --> 44:31.380
<i>No commitments attached!</i>

44:31.460 --> 44:34.460
<i>Ma'am, we're calling you because your son
has a bullying problem.</i>

44:34.550 --> 44:37.380
<i>Really? Who's bothering him?</i>

44:37.460 --> 44:39.630
<i>No, ma'am, your son
is the one bullying others.</i>

44:39.720 --> 44:42.340
<i>You need to take steps
to modify his behavior.</i>

44:42.430 --> 44:45.850
<i>Our psychologists here in Mexico City
can help you and your son.</i>

44:45.930 --> 44:49.770
<i>Call one of our offices

44:52.020 --> 44:55.400
<i>Take advantage of the enhanced

<i>With just 7.5% interest

44:58.530 --> 45:01.240
<i>Participate also in our monthly raffles
where you can win...</i>

48:39.870 --> 48:42.000
...I really enjoy it
because it's based on poems

48:42.080 --> 48:45.050
by Mario Benedetti and Oliverio Girondo.

48:46.884 --> 48:50.550
The movie has a poem called
"El espantapájaros" [The Scarecrow],

48:50.630 --> 48:52.720
which is what the movie
is based on,

48:52.800 --> 48:58.060
that speaks of finding perfect love
or the love that left a mark on your life.

48:58.140 --> 49:03.860
The main character is a prostitute
and the other character is a poet

49:03.940 --> 49:08.150
{\an8}who spends more time working on
advertising than on his career.

49:08.240 --> 49:13.990
And the actor Nacha Guevara
plays the role of Death.

49:15.620 --> 49:20.290
She wants to take him away
the day he stops writing poetry,

49:20.370 --> 49:24.880
writing about feelings, love, sensations.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.420
I love films.

49:26.500 --> 49:32.090
I've seen a cult film
called <i>Blade Runner.</i>

49:32.180 --> 49:35.260
What do you think of <i>Blade Runner?</i>

49:35.350 --> 49:37.310
Oh, you don't understand me, do you?

49:37.390 --> 49:38.796
"No understand."

49:41.480 --> 49:44.060
I've read <i>La muerte del estratega
[Death of a Strategist].</i>

49:44.150 --> 49:49.570
It's a beautiful book.
I like how it describes everyday details.

49:49.650 --> 49:54.030
The main character of this novel
meets Simón Bolívar.

49:54.110 --> 49:58.490
When he enters a room
to meet the Liberator of America,

49:58.580 --> 50:01.040
there is a chair against the wall,

50:01.120 --> 50:04.960
and he describes how the humidity
eats away at the wall.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.500
As a kid, I would see
those drops of humidity

50:07.590 --> 50:11.760
that looked like they were made of cotton
and I would play at breaking them apart.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.640
I like that.
Álvaro Mutis is a great writer.

50:14.720 --> 50:19.560
I've read a book called
<i>Stories for After Making Love.</i>

50:20.350 --> 50:22.187
More than anything, I bought the book...

50:22.230 --> 50:23.770
Good afternoon!
How do we get downtown?

50:23.850 --> 50:25.900
We are downtown.
Where do you need to go?

50:25.980 --> 50:28.744
-Right to downtown.
-This is downtown.

50:29.178 --> 50:30.860
After this intersection and the next,

50:30.940 --> 50:33.360
you'll find the Center Square
and the cathedral on your right.

50:33.450 --> 50:36.370
-Oh, okay. Thanks.
-Sure.

50:49.550 --> 50:55.550
{\an8}<i>"An imagined woman on the platform
of any metro station in this city.</i>

50:56.340 --> 50:58.430
{\an8}<i>A woman who did not arrive,</i>

50:58.510 --> 51:01.680
{\an8}<i>who didn't come
but nonetheless walks among the people</i>

51:01.770 --> 51:05.140
<i>searching for the same exits as us.</i>

51:05.230 --> 51:09.230
<i>An imagined woman,
lost in the forest of Chapultepec</i>

51:09.310 --> 51:11.900
<i>or in the thickness of some dream.</i>

51:11.980 --> 51:16.610
<i>An imagined woman, simply,
running away like all of them</i>

51:16.700 --> 51:19.830
<i>from some photo no one has taken yet.</i>

51:19.910 --> 51:22.370
<i>They walk with us, but don't know it,</i>

51:22.450 --> 51:25.120
<i>they don't even imagine it.</i>

51:25.210 --> 51:31.340
{\an8}<i>We walk beside them on their behalf,
on the same uneven pavements</i>

51:31.420 --> 51:35.420
{\an8}<i>or step on imagined leaves,
perhaps already stepped on by them,</i>

51:35.510 --> 51:39.340
<i>who hardly insinuate
the existence of the fall."</i>

51:45.180 --> 51:47.730
Sir... here.

51:47.810 --> 51:49.400
-Here?
-I'm going to that building.

51:49.480 --> 51:52.190
If you are going up the street,
I'll take you. Not a problem.

51:52.270 --> 51:56.200
-Sir... No, no, no. Here.
-Okay.

52:38.140 --> 52:39.270
<i>Hello?</i>

52:39.300 --> 52:40.510
Hey.

52:40.540 --> 52:42.510
I got kicked out
of <i>Joint Visions.</i>

52:42.540 --> 52:43.680
<i>Okay.</i>

52:43.710 --> 52:45.180
Yeah.

52:45.210 --> 52:46.880
But I know what I'm gonna do.
I know the city.

52:46.910 --> 52:48.510
I've been walking around.
I've been watching him.

52:48.550 --> 52:50.320
<i>He hangs out with this group
that looks like</i>

52:50.350 --> 52:54.790
<i>a modern fucking version of the
Jack Kerouac-Neil Cassidy gang.</i>

52:54.820 --> 52:57.660
They do some kind
of activism or something.

52:57.690 --> 52:58.930
I think he saw me.

53:00.730 --> 53:02.860
- Hello?
<i>- It's fine, Sebastian.</i>

53:02.900 --> 53:04.700
<i>Just do whatever
you have to do.</i>

53:04.730 --> 53:06.400
<i>I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

53:10.570 --> 53:12.000
<i>Hey, guys.
This is Paige.</i>

53:12.040 --> 53:13.170
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back</i>

53:13.210 --> 53:14.570
<i>with you as soon as I can.</i>

53:16.410 --> 53:18.410
<i>Hey guys, this is Paige.</i>

53:18.440 --> 53:20.210
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back with you as soon as I...</i>

53:20.250 --> 53:23.080
<i>It's fine, Sebastian, just do
whatever you have to do.</i>

53:23.120 --> 53:24.420
<i>I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

53:24.450 --> 53:26.420
<i>Hey, guys.
This is Paige.</i>

53:26.450 --> 53:28.250
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back with you as soon as I...</i>

53:28.290 --> 53:30.160
<i>It's fine, Sebastian; just do
whatever you have to do.</i>

55:04.880 --> 55:06.090
This is awkward.

55:08.220 --> 55:09.390
Read this.

55:11.820 --> 55:14.660
<i>...instead, Ava,</i>
<i>our Oklahoma town,</i>

55:14.690 --> 55:18.560
<i>is very, let's say, lonely.</i>

55:18.600 --> 55:21.200
<i>In Ava, you don't see
many people walking,</i>

55:21.230 --> 55:24.200
<i>except those loners that
traverse endless pathways</i>

55:24.240 --> 55:26.110
<i>seemingly going
from one fast food...</i>

55:26.140 --> 55:27.710
<i>...one of those people
that hits those bars</i>

55:27.740 --> 55:30.140
<i>during the day
is our father, Leam.</i>

55:30.180 --> 55:33.850
I really can't do this
right now, okay?

55:34.480 --> 55:36.150
Maybe later.

55:36.180 --> 55:37.350
Okay.

55:40.490 --> 55:42.790
<i>I think, though,</i>
<i>that, after all,</i>

55:42.820 --> 55:44.460
<i>my friends might be right
when they say</i>

55:44.490 --> 55:46.660
<i>that the US is
a better place than Mexico</i>

55:46.690 --> 55:49.360
<i>with all that violence,
and narcos, and...</i>

55:49.390 --> 55:51.700
<i>but again,
what consolation is that?</i>

55:51.730 --> 55:54.230
<i>Ava is a sad little town
that cannot grow</i>

55:54.270 --> 55:56.500
<i>because of the backwardness
of its people.</i>

55:56.530 --> 55:58.340
<i>My own backwardness
has kept me here.</i>

56:01.440 --> 56:03.740
<i>And Dad's contempt towards me</i>

56:03.780 --> 56:06.480
<i>is no more than
his unbearable pain.</i>

56:06.510 --> 56:08.580
<i>I am just there
to pick up the pieces.</i>

56:17.020 --> 56:20.660
<i>In the end, our faces</i>
<i>are reflected in a mirror</i>

56:20.690 --> 56:24.230
<i>covered in a dust that
the rain cannot cleanse.</i>

56:24.260 --> 56:27.600
<i>A mirror like the one I see
in this tidy and clean cell.</i>

57:38.410 --> 57:42.040
November 23, 2016

57:42.120 --> 57:45.460
No place is safe.

57:45.540 --> 57:49.300
Auschwitz, the Tlatelolco Massacre,

57:49.380 --> 57:51.760
the Oklahoma City Bombing,

57:51.840 --> 57:53.590
Hiroshima,

57:53.680 --> 57:59.730
horrible just like Alain Resnais
showed in his film.

57:59.810 --> 58:04.860
Venezuela, and the police brutality
in the U.S.

58:04.940 --> 58:09.360
Conflicts between countries
are as paradoxical

58:09.440 --> 58:15.660
as the ones that can destroy a family.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.760
FOREIGN ACTIVISM: A REASON
FOR CONTROVERSY IN MEXICO

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.830

<i>Welcome to skylines,</i>

<i>Welcome on board.
Lovely to have you with us.</i>

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.720
<i>As we leave

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:18.350
<i>Dear, brother...</i>

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.920
<i>Now, crossing the Atlantic,</i>

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.390
<i>I can finally answer you,</i>

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.190
<i>at least in my head,</i>

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.760
<i>but with a sense
that you can hear me.</i>

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:27.590
<i>Images cloud my mind</i>

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.560
<i>while that little Oklahoma
town, Ava, appears in flashes.</i>

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.800
<i>The reds and oranges
are what I see the most.</i>

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:47.910
<i>So we anticipate</i>
<i>pushing back</i>

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:50.280
<i>a few minutes
ahead of schedule.</i>

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.990
<i>The cabin crew will demonstrate
the safety equipment procedures</i>

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.190
<i>of this aircraft,

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.660
<i>Now, crossing the</i>
<i>Atlantic, I think of the wall</i>

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.390
<i>that's someday meant to divide
Mexico and the US.</i>

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.560
<i>What a... hm... deplorable idea,</i>

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.770
<i>but of course, not surprising.</i>

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.970
<i>I'm glad you came
to Mexico, Sebastián.</i>

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.610
<i>I'm glad you saw a little of
the place where you were born,</i>

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.240
<i>although you came
to save me, I know.</i>

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.380
<i>Smart move.</i>

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:21.410
<i>I'm glad you didn't just
send me a text, dear brother.</i>

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.450
<i>And that your
girlfriend understood,</i>

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.850
<i>that she didn't give up.</i>

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:50.740
<i>emanates immense tenderness.</i>

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.980
<i>Violence can disrupt your life
without even touching you,</i>

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.150
<i>like the spinning
winds of a tornado.</i>

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.850
<i>While Monica heard
horror stories</i>

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:02.990
<i>about the brutality
of Pinochet in her attic,</i>

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.890
<i>in another attic,

<i>with my father and Lloyd.</i>

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.830
Remember Lloyd?"

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.660
<i>They were always</i>
<i>playing at writing stories</i>

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.030
<i>for the newspapers
up in the attic.</i>

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.570
Remember?

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.440
<i>It was like a game,
not knowing</i>

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.240
<i>that something devastating
was coming our way.</i>

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:21.668
DEBATE REGARDING TLATELOLCO

01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:23.210
<i>Seeing you has
made me think again</i>

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.080
<i>about the Tlatelolco Massacre,</i>

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.010
<i>which our father reported,</i>

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.510
<i>and the Oklahoma City bombing,</i>

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:30.480
<i>which is somehow part
of our own story.</i>

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.850
... <i>Believe that</i>
<i>a 1,200-pound car-bomb is what</i>

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:36.020
<i>ripped through the nine-story building
shortly after 9:00 this morning.</i>

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:38.020
- <i>Many of the victims...</i>
<i>- And years later,</i>

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.990
<i>even dad's favorite bar
in Ava burned down.</i>

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.030
- <i>Hm.</i>
<i>- On Tuesday of last week,</i>

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.130
<i>a lightning strike
and the fire that followed...</i>

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.670
<i>...gutted Leam Gaertner's
"happy place."</i>

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.540
<i>Fire grew fast in this beloved bar
of Ava with very little time to...</i>

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.710
<i>And thinking</i>
<i>about our mother,</i>

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.680
<i>put away in London
for as long as I can remember,</i>

01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:00.410
<i>I think of what Tomás
Eloy Martínez once said:</i>

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:03.180
<i>'When we read that there were
one hundred thousand victims</i>

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.180
<i>'in a tsunami in Bangladesh,</i>

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:09.460
<i>'the data shocks us,
but it does not move us.</i>

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:11.890
<i>'If we read, instead,
the tragedy of a woman</i>

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:15.290
<i>'who has been left alone
in the world after a tsunami</i>

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:18.570
<i>'and we followed step-by-step
the history of her losses,</i>

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.630
<i>'we'd know everything there is
to know about that tsunami</i>

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.700
<i>'and all there is to know
about chance</i>

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.940
<i>'and about involuntary
and sudden misfortunes.'</i>

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:39.050
<i>Your road trip brought all
of this to me, dear brother.</i>

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.320
<i>It reminded me of the good
life we had in Oklahoma.</i>

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.360
February 8, 2017

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:56.600
<i>But there are millions
of other stories out there.</i>

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.840
<i>Where did the 21st century
go wrong?</i>

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:02.470
<i>The planet is full
of dictators, liars, weapons,</i>

01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:04.140
<i>and yet we cling
to the illusion</i>

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.010
<i>that we are moving forward.</i>

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.650
<i>That's why I read
Walter Benjamin.</i>

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.480
<i>I don't believe
in that progress either,</i>

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.020
<i>especially when I walk,
looking around obsessively,</i>

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:15.120
<i>trying to understand...
something.</i>

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:18.290
<i>That's what drove
Mónica away, I'm sure.</i>

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.990
<i>Maybe as I try to write,</i>

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:22.190
<i>a nuclear bomb is
crossing the Atlantic.</i>

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.260
<i>Maybe, right now, as I walk,</i>

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.370
<i>the world is turning
into a mushroom cloud</i>

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.800
<i>in which we all burn like
delicate autumn leaves,</i>

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.440
<i>slowly growing dark</i>

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:36.280
<i>and turning into fragile,
gray, absurd ashes.</i>

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:43.250
JOINT VISIONS.

Chronicles

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.460
{\an8}Oklahoma Mon Amour
By Nico Gaertner

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.010
{\an8}For Rose

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:52.010
{\an8}In 1998, Fiona and Leam
Gaertner traveled for nine days

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:53.130
{\an8}through the north of Mexico,
the infamous border,

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.760
{\an8}the never-ending plains of Texas,

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.720
{\an8}until reaching
the reddish Oklahoma territory.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.310
{\an8}Fiona's dry but playful British humor
helped them ease away

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:00.930
{\an8}from their fearless activism.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.390
{\an8}She would say, for instance,

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.440
{\an8}"England is an island
with only seven faces,

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.940
{\an8}and mine is one of them."

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.690
{\an8}Sebastián's, let's say, "road movie"
from 2016, also lasted nine days.

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:11.990
{\an8}He was afraid to reach Mexico
and Latin America,

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:15.070
{\an8}while thinking that "his" own country
was falling apart.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.990
{\an8}Oklahoma-- who would have thought--

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.280
{\an8}is the place that unites
and separates them all,

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:21.160
{\an8}as it is the center of so many stories

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.960
{\an8}hidden underneath
that reddish land that stretches on...
