_

00:32.900 --> 00:34.980
Ray.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.380
Who let you in?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.819
Your mum.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.340
Hmm.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.760
How ya feeling, all right?

00:47.780 --> 00:49.740
Not bad.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.080
For a bloke who's been
in a fucking coma.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.200
Went and saw that
brother-in-law of yours.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.959
He fucking set me up.

01:05.950 --> 01:07.900
Uh-huh.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.180
What'd you do to him?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.440
Bit of this.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.940
Bit of that.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.260
And the other pricks?

01:26.970 --> 01:29.140
They'll live.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.940
I fucking owe you one.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.610
I'll add it to the list.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.020
Nah, it gives me the shits.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.160
And what's with the fucking cowboy hats?

01:49.180 --> 01:50.850
Even the old country days,
fucking hardly anybody

01:50.870 --> 01:52.440
- wore a cowboy hat.
- Mm.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.910
Especially inside.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.020
Johnny Cash never wore one.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.760
Fuck, Johnny Cash never wore one.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.280
Now, every cunt's wearing a cowboy hat.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.880
- Aye.
- Yeah, I think...

02:00.900 --> 02:03.220
I think their record company
tells 'em to wear the hat.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.316
You know, like it's... like
it's fucking advertising.

02:05.340 --> 02:06.940
- Probably.
- World's gone to shit, mate.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Everything's just money, money, money.

02:09.139 --> 02:10.800
That's it.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.440
Fuck.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.620
So you still moving jewelry?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.840
Yeah. What do you need?

02:21.040 --> 02:24.140
Girlfriend's got a
birthday coming up, so...

02:24.240 --> 02:25.760
How much you wanna spend?

02:25.780 --> 02:27.660
200, 300.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.460
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.380
Bewdy.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.760
Here's trouble.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
- What's going on?
- Hey.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.240
Did you tell Brittany there's
no such thing as Jesus?

03:02.780 --> 03:05.620
No, she asked me if Santa was real...

03:05.640 --> 03:07.080
I don't care about Santa.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.100
Do you want me to tell you
what happened or not?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.140
- Sorry, okay, yeah.
- Okay.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.300
So she asked me if Jesus was real,

03:15.360 --> 03:18.580
and I said, um, I don't
know for sure, 100%,

03:18.600 --> 03:21.280
if he was real, but I said
he could've been real.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.776
You know Quentin and I are
raising your daughter

03:22.800 --> 03:24.000
as a Christian, right?

03:24.100 --> 03:25.629
Yeah, I know that, yeah.

03:25.630 --> 03:28.240
So why would you tell her
something like that?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.220
'Cause I don't wanna lie to her.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.480
You don't wanna lie to her,

03:31.560 --> 03:33.660
but you tell her unicorns exist?

03:43.260 --> 03:44.739
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:44.740 --> 03:46.620
- Love you.
- Love you.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.640
Color suits you.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.620
Matches your eyes.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.500
- What'd you say?
- You heard.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.000
- Did you hear that, Britt?
- No. Finished.

04:16.269 --> 04:18.480
Beautiful.

04:19.140 --> 04:22.260
Can you paint my nails, please, Dad?

04:22.510 --> 04:24.060
Mm...

04:24.340 --> 04:26.960
- Please?
- All right, here.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.700
Tsk.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.460
- Jeez, mate.
- Fuck.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.400
You all right?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.599
Careful, Britt.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.340
Stay away from that glass there.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.920
Nothing fucking works anymore.

04:53.470 --> 04:55.809
Sit up, sit up, sit up. All right.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.940
I'm gonna lift you up. All right?

05:00.020 --> 05:01.330
Lean against here, buddy.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.959
I'm fucking over this.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.230
I know you are, mate, I know you are.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.040
You all right?

05:07.440 --> 05:09.400
I'm sorry, Britt.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.160
Looks like I owe you a dollar.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.600
It's okay.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.880
But yes, you owe me three
dollars, actually.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.240
She's onto it.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.700
She certainly is, mate. All right.

05:20.740 --> 05:21.750
I'm gonna get you out of here, mate,

05:21.760 --> 05:22.780
so I can clean this up.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.820
- All right?
- Yeah.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.260
You all right?

05:32.840 --> 05:37.100
Feeling is of power, of empowerment.

05:37.780 --> 05:40.460
Hi. Come in, come in.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.580
- It's Ray, is it?
- Yeah.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.440
- I'm Peter.
- How ya goin', mate?

05:45.460 --> 05:46.460
- I'm good.
- Good to meet you.

05:46.470 --> 05:48.920
Yeah, you too. This is Steve,

05:49.120 --> 05:51.080
Bob, Carlo,

05:51.140 --> 05:53.239
and, uh, this is Max.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.520
- Take a seat.
- Cheers mate.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.720
All right, so now... now we're all here,

05:59.740 --> 06:02.360
we can get started. Um...

06:02.900 --> 06:05.800
Uh, the first thing we'll
do is we'll, uh...

06:05.820 --> 06:08.320
We'll go around the room,
introduce ourselves,

06:08.340 --> 06:10.880
and, uh, you know, just
tell us a little bit

06:10.900 --> 06:12.700
about why you're here.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.840
Ray, do you wanna...

06:14.940 --> 06:17.300
You wanna get us... get us started?

06:17.370 --> 06:19.560
So... so what do you want me to do?

06:19.700 --> 06:21.220
Well, introduce yourself first,

06:21.260 --> 06:22.780
and then tell us why you're here.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.560
Okay. My name is Ray.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.900
Um, I'm 40.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.080
Divorced.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.800
Got a kid.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.520
Um, work security.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.480
That's about it.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.940
And why are you here?

06:41.880 --> 06:44.060
Oh, I bashed a bloke.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.320
And you've been ordered
to be here by the court.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.980
Mm.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.340
Do you think that you've
got an anger problem?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.800
No.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.760
Okay.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.960
Carlo, do you wanna go next?

07:02.840 --> 07:05.300
Um, yeah. Um...

07:06.000 --> 07:09.020
So, I'm 43. Um...

07:09.160 --> 07:12.500
Got a young son, and... and daughter.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.600
Work in the building industry, and, uh,

07:15.620 --> 07:18.160
been married, uh, 12 years.

07:19.030 --> 07:21.500
And I'm here 'cause, um,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.339
'cause my wife said
she'd divorce me if I,

07:23.340 --> 07:25.780
mm, didn't attend, so...

07:25.820 --> 07:27.980
And why does your wife
want you to be here?

07:28.380 --> 07:30.310
Uh, she reckons I'm angry.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.560
What do you reckon?

07:33.080 --> 07:34.360
Sometimes.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.280
And when you... when you
get angry, what do you do?

07:39.740 --> 07:42.220
Sort of, um...

07:42.280 --> 07:44.480
Sort of lash out sometimes.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.960
At who?

07:48.080 --> 07:49.480
My wife.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.060
Kids.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.920
You lash out physically?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.280
Yeah.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.280
Thanks, Carlo. Uh, Steve.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.160
Yeah, uh...

08:04.830 --> 08:07.929
Hey, I'm 38. Uh, married.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.940
No kids.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.850
Uh, we're separated at the moment,

08:11.870 --> 08:13.860
wife and I.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.840
Um...

08:15.940 --> 08:19.280
I'm not working at the moment,
so it's pretty tough, you know.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.610
Reason I'm here, I just
wanna patch things up

08:22.700 --> 08:24.359
with the missus, about it.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.140
And your... your separation,

08:26.170 --> 08:28.740
is that something to do
with anger-related issues?

08:28.780 --> 08:30.040
Yeah.

08:30.070 --> 08:32.400
I just lose my temper.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.840
And how does that manifest itself?

08:34.919 --> 08:35.960
What?

08:36.500 --> 08:40.159
How does, uh... how does
your anger show itself?

08:42.630 --> 08:44.670
Sometimes I hit her and stuff.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.520
Is everything okay, Ray?

08:51.740 --> 08:54.180
I think I'm in the wrong room.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.120
What makes you say that?

08:58.040 --> 09:00.680
Well, the person I bashed was a bloke.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.570
Not a child or a woman.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.780
And what's your point?

09:06.940 --> 09:08.640
Well, no offense, but I
don't really wanna sit here

09:08.660 --> 09:10.770
with a bunch of fucking
wife-bashers and child-beaters,

09:10.780 --> 09:11.780
you know what I mean?

09:11.800 --> 09:14.010
- What the fuck did you say?
- You heard what I said.

09:14.030 --> 09:15.030
- Time out, time out.
- Hey.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.680
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on, tough boy.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.100
You're dead.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.469
I can fuck you up, you little fucking...

09:20.470 --> 09:22.020
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Get the fuck off me, man.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.879
- Outside, outside, please.
- Are you all right, mate?

09:23.880 --> 09:24.900
I'm good, mate.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.320
Fuck's sake. Fuck!

09:31.240 --> 09:33.400
Look, if you can't take this seriously,

09:33.420 --> 09:36.240
then I'll be recommending
jail time instead.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.700
Okay? Do you wanna do jail time?

09:37.770 --> 09:39.000
Not particularly, no.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.740
Well, then, I expect you
to behave yourself.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.200
If you're gonna cause trouble,

09:43.280 --> 09:45.820
then we'll have to come to
some other arrangement.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.300
Okay, next order of business.

09:56.460 --> 09:59.040
Did a mate of yours get bashed recently?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.400
A gun deal?

10:02.360 --> 10:04.430
- Why do you wanna know?
- I just need to know.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.030
Just... just...

10:06.100 --> 10:07.480
tell me.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.700
Maybe.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.509
I'm gonna ask you,

10:13.510 --> 10:16.060
did you bash the guys that...

10:16.280 --> 10:18.160
that ripped off your mate?

10:19.600 --> 10:21.760
Yeah.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.420
Right, so those guys,
the ones you bashed,

10:25.520 --> 10:29.460
they belong to a crew run
by a guy called Davros.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.540
And Davros is my son-in-law's brother.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.740
- Oops.
- Yeah.

10:35.820 --> 10:37.219
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.680
So,

10:38.820 --> 10:40.920
I need you to go sit down with him.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.120
What for?

10:42.480 --> 10:45.860
- 'Cause he's fucking pissed.
- So?

10:46.110 --> 10:48.880
Mate, this guy's family, okay?

10:48.960 --> 10:51.280
I'm asking you a favor here, please.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.630
Just sit down with him.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.020
Why don't you shove a
bit more in your gob?

11:24.120 --> 11:26.040
A-ha.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.600
Ah, very nice, mate.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.160
Really good.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.740
- What do I owe you?
- Don't worry about it.

11:34.810 --> 11:36.196
- No, I'll give you some money.
- Nah.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.060
Just buy us a beer.

11:40.410 --> 11:41.660
Done.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.440
- Easy.
- Appreciate it.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.680
Yeah.

11:51.220 --> 11:53.370
All right, what about these ones?

11:56.100 --> 11:57.920
No.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.780
Oh.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.480
There you go.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.800
Those.

12:05.860 --> 12:08.080
I thought you wanted to
buy me some sexy undies.

12:08.110 --> 12:09.980
Yeah, they're sexy.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.540
They're plain cotton.

12:11.580 --> 12:12.919
They're sexier than those ones.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.340
What do you mean? Guys
love the lacy ones.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.540
No, we don't. You guys like 'em.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.540
- Go with the cotton ones.
- Oh.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.160
I don't want 'em.

12:22.180 --> 12:23.640
Well, you've gotta pay for them.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.740
No, give 'em me card.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.560
Why don't you wanna do it?

12:27.720 --> 12:29.800
'Cause.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.140
Are you worried they're gonna
think they're for you?

12:32.160 --> 12:33.860
Possibly.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.260
Oh, yeah, shot in 4K.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.900
Oh.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.980
Oh, yeah, there we go.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.090
That's it.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.880
That's it.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.020
Mmm.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.760
Fuck.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.320
Jesus fucking Christ.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.060
Vasilli? What the fuck?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.256
- Where's safe?
- Where's safe?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.479
- Is safe?
- Is it safe?

13:28.480 --> 13:29.700
Yes.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.040
Is it safe where?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.140
Safe, where?

13:34.240 --> 13:36.140
What the fuck are you talking... ah!

13:36.180 --> 13:37.930
Safe. Safe. Money, money, safe.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.260
Yes, okay, okay, okay.

13:40.380 --> 13:41.840
It's in the fucking garage.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.160
- Garage?
- Yes.

13:43.260 --> 13:45.980
Go. Go, go, go.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.520
_

14:31.660 --> 14:32.960
Open it.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.200
I don't have the combination.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.370
What?

14:37.440 --> 14:39.320
I wrote it down somewhere.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.160
Where?

14:41.260 --> 14:43.520
Don't know. It's... upstairs.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.059
You better no fucking me.

14:46.060 --> 14:48.000
Mate, why would I be fucking you?

14:49.860 --> 14:53.960
Let's go. Let's go.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.570
- Come on.
- All right.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.220
Fuckin' hell.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.080
Ah, fuck.

15:11.540 --> 15:12.570
Come on.

15:12.610 --> 15:15.440
Well, if it's not there then...

15:15.500 --> 15:17.999
I'm positive it was up in the top one,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.020
but she moves things
around all the time.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.080
- What we do?
- If it's not there, I don't...

15:22.100 --> 15:23.116
I don't know what she's done with it.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.920
I'm just gonna have to give it a crack.

15:27.210 --> 15:30.340
Okay, go, go.

15:33.750 --> 15:34.880
- Hurry.
- 'Ey.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.340
I just got out of hospital, mate.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.980
Just calm down.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.040
Hurry up.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.560
Yeah.

16:01.770 --> 16:04.060
I have to be able to hear the click.

16:04.140 --> 16:06.280
I don't know the
combination. You're just

16:06.300 --> 16:08.296
gonna have to give me about
five minutes, all right?

16:08.320 --> 16:10.119
Okay. In five minutes,

16:10.120 --> 16:13.000
if not open, I shoot you in face.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.230
Uh-huh.

16:15.270 --> 16:16.640
You don't believe me?

16:16.870 --> 16:18.660
No, I believe you.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.260
- How much longer?
- Two minutes, tops.

16:34.340 --> 16:35.810
I'm nearly there.

16:35.940 --> 16:37.540
Hurry up!

16:37.680 --> 16:39.680
Mate, I almost had it there.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.629
Now I gotta fucking
start all over again.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.900
- Well, start then.
- Well, fuck, just be quiet.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.010
- Stop talking.
- I gotta listen to the fucking click.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.396
- You stop talking.
- You stop talking.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.756
- You stop talking.
- No, you stop talking.

16:48.780 --> 16:50.219
I can't hear the clicks.

16:50.220 --> 16:51.920
You know how this works?

16:58.540 --> 17:00.600
Ten seconds I shoot. Ten,

17:01.270 --> 17:03.080
nine,

17:03.240 --> 17:04.779
eight,

17:04.780 --> 17:06.270
six...

17:06.400 --> 17:08.420
Skipped seven. Ten,

17:08.810 --> 17:10.609
nine,

17:10.680 --> 17:12.608
eight, seven,

17:12.609 --> 17:14.619
six, five,

17:14.760 --> 17:17.079
four, three,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.940
- two...
- Bingo.

17:21.770 --> 17:23.200
Ah.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.480
Ha-ha, good, good, good.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.480
Where bag?

17:27.510 --> 17:29.880
- What?
- Bag, you know, put shit in.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.260
You didn't bring a bag?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.340
Where bag?

17:33.480 --> 17:34.959
There's plastic bags up in the kitchen.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.480
No, no, no, no plastic bag.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.580
What're you, stupid? Big bag.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.660
I got a big bag up in the cupboard.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.720
Let's go. Fuck.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.620
Go, go, go.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.770
You know, generally
when you rob somebody,

17:47.780 --> 17:49.020
you bring your own bag.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.920
Shut fuck up.

18:02.180 --> 18:05.529
There. There you go.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.330
Nice big bag.

18:07.470 --> 18:09.840
Good.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.660
Go, go.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.469
- Go.
- Fucking right-o.

18:19.610 --> 18:20.940
What?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.480
Fill.

18:22.940 --> 18:25.060
Don't look at me. Fill.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.420
Ah, ah, ah, careful with gun.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.760
Careful with gun.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.040
- Hurry up. Come on.
- All right,

18:44.050 --> 18:45.520
I'm going as fast as I can.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.640
Happy?

18:52.640 --> 18:55.700
Well, brother, I rough with you,

18:55.800 --> 18:57.820
but I need money, so,

18:57.960 --> 19:01.470
no bad feeling. Hmm?

19:07.910 --> 19:09.300
What fuck?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.640
You took your bloody time.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.800
Lucky I fucking came at all.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.580
Shoot the prick, will you?

19:23.660 --> 19:25.300
I'm not doing it.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.940
What's your problem?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.810
Well, he's your fucking brother-in-law.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.700
Yeah, I know, that's why
I don't wanna do it.

19:30.860 --> 19:31.920
No.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.000
Where's your car?

19:38.060 --> 19:39.770
He's not going in my car.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.420
Well, you gotta. Tat's got the Falcon.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.340
Nah, I just had it
detailed, mate, forget it.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.900
Well, I'll get a fucking tarp.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.640
Cool?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.720
Gotta get rid of him.

19:58.180 --> 19:59.740
Get him inside.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.380
Right, roll him.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.740
There we go.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.780
'Ey.

20:06.820 --> 20:08.240
- Good?
- Right.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.600
Right.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.730
I'm gonna get the car.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.040
I'm gonna back it up.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.160
I knock.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.440
Door opens. He goes in the boot, right?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.820
- Yeah.
- Got it?

20:31.840 --> 20:34.160
Yeah, cool. Okay, good.

20:34.220 --> 20:35.220
Yeah.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.700
Ah, fuck, Tat's home.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.680
Fuck.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.840
Ah, just... just fucking just stay here.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.080
Come on, you fucking cunt.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.560
Hey.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.040
What's this?

21:11.080 --> 21:14.000
- Huh?
- What happened to the glass?

21:14.140 --> 21:16.680
Ah, a bird...

21:16.700 --> 21:19.120
- flew into it.
- When?

21:19.220 --> 21:22.570
- Just before.
- Is the bird okay?

21:22.640 --> 21:24.309
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he just flew away.

21:24.310 --> 21:27.330
He just hit the glass, flew away.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.440
Why you have knife?

21:30.530 --> 21:33.680
'Cause I couldn't find the broom.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.040
So I was just gonna use that.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.940
It's in the kitchen cupboard.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.000
Ah.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.380
Didn't look.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.259
- What an idiot.
- _

21:44.260 --> 21:45.320
Yeah.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.036
Go and take a bath, or you're
gonna get a cold there.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.060
- Da.
- How was the gym?

21:48.070 --> 21:49.080
- All right?
- Good.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.500
Yeah? _

21:52.140 --> 21:53.520
Fuck.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.730
- Chop him up.
- Fuck off.

22:02.770 --> 22:03.860
Why not?

22:03.900 --> 22:05.160
He's your fucking brother-in-law.

22:05.180 --> 22:06.540
- You do it.
- Why do you keep saying that?

22:06.550 --> 22:08.100
Who gives a fuck whose
brother-in-law he is?

22:08.120 --> 22:09.820
- Come on.
- Fucking chop him up later.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.399
I can't chop him up later.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.940
We gotta chop him up now.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.359
He'll be easier to get
out in smaller pieces.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.880
- Fuck, man, I'll owe ya.
- Keep fucking saying that.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.800
Hold on, we gotta get
him up on the table.

22:21.260 --> 22:22.820
Okay, okay. Come on, quick.

22:22.850 --> 22:24.420
Can't lift the fat cunt me self.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.480
- Okay.

- Da?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.160
What're you doing?

23:04.860 --> 23:06.320
Cleaning up.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.370
Ah!

23:10.430 --> 23:12.180

- What?

23:12.220 --> 23:14.020
Fuck me!

23:14.780 --> 23:16.380

23:16.420 --> 23:18.540
Vasya.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.920
_

23:21.980 --> 23:24.330
What fuck goes on?

23:24.470 --> 23:26.640
Your fucking brother tried to rob us.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.000
- Vasya.
- Yeah, he held a gun to my head,

23:29.050 --> 23:30.610
and he said empty the safe downstairs

23:30.620 --> 23:32.020
or he was gonna kill me.

23:32.060 --> 23:33.539
If Ray hadn't come over,

23:33.540 --> 23:34.780
he would've fucking shot me.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.459
- You know that?
- _

23:36.460 --> 23:38.930

23:38.960 --> 23:41.160

23:41.420 --> 23:43.839
- Fuck you, Gary, fuck you.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.560

Fuck you, Gary.

- Fuck you, Gary.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.060
Wasn't dead.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.360
Well, thanks, Captain Obvious.

24:02.540 --> 24:03.960
Bullet...

24:04.000 --> 24:06.840
Bullet must've ricocheted off his skull.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.880
You couldn't tell when
you were cutting him?

24:09.920 --> 24:11.620
You couldn't tell he
was still breathing?

24:11.650 --> 24:12.700
No?

24:12.710 --> 24:14.279
Well, you didn't fucking
recognize him breathing,

24:14.280 --> 24:15.900
