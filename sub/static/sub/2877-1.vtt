WEBVTT

00:07.632 --> 00:08.674
Oh.

00:08.842 --> 00:14.263
The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
was such a turn-on. You wanna?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.558
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.811
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.647
- Hey.
- What's up?

00:23.857 --> 00:27.901
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
by the way, there's no law against.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.447
And, um, then we're gonna grab
some food. So if you want...

00:32.824 --> 00:34.450
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?

00:34.659 --> 00:37.953
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.914
- Sounds like he's with someone.
- He could be alone.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.543
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.212
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.340
Yeah, I hear someone else in there with him.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.262
Oh.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.890
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.892
I didn't even have to ask you
to call me that.

01:02.645 --> 01:06.315
- Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

01:06.483 --> 01:10.861
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

01:13.364 --> 01:15.616
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.201
This is none of our business.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.662
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!

01:21.414 --> 01:25.417
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.420
Ha, ha. I love Barbados.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.512
- I can't believe I'm kissing you.
- Ha, ha.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.056
- I'm kissing Rachel!
- Ha, ha.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.767
- I know. I'm her. Ha, ha.
- Oh!

01:43.353 --> 01:45.771
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

01:45.980 --> 01:47.773
- What?
- Get over here!

01:51.653 --> 01:53.487
- Oh.
- Whoa!

01:53.655 --> 01:56.615
Oh, my God! I love how thin these walls are!

02:05.917 --> 02:07.876
Thank you.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.473
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
happen between us. What changed?

03:03.641 --> 03:06.351
- Well, I only said that because of Ross.
- Mm.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.396
- And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
- What?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.565
Ross and Charlie?

03:11.733 --> 03:15.944
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?

03:18.531 --> 03:20.407
- Ah, who am I to talk? Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.287
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

03:25.455 --> 03:28.540
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.461
- No one is manning that wall!
- I'm on it!

03:35.089 --> 03:37.174
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.427
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.889
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!

03:44.098 --> 03:47.684
- You realize that's your brother.
- Not until you said it. Somebody switch!

03:50.104 --> 03:52.189
Wow! Wait a minute.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.150
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.946
Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones
leaving with the person we came with!

03:59.155 --> 04:03.033
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.245
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.414
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.712
You gotta hear this, it's great!
It's like free porn.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.971
Um...

04:24.138 --> 04:28.100
- Is everything okay?
- It's just... I don't think I can do this.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.644
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?

04:30.812 --> 04:34.189
- I saw that report, with the infrared...
- No! No.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.525
No, uh...

04:37.193 --> 04:41.113
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.

04:41.281 --> 04:45.158
Before anything more happens between us,
I need to know he's okay with it.

04:46.035 --> 04:49.538
- I, uh, completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.627
I just need a second before I can,
you know...

05:00.800 --> 05:04.469
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.312
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay!

05:15.189 --> 05:16.857
That's the door. He's gone.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.027
And she's turning on the TV...

05:20.194 --> 05:24.990
...and watching Miss Congeniality.

05:25.616 --> 05:29.661
Honey? If you know it through a wall,
you know it too well.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.921
Hey, what are you guys doing?

05:42.842 --> 05:47.054
Oh, we're just... We're sad to go,
so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.930
I love you...

05:50.058 --> 05:54.561
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.858
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.030
Bye.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.826
Okay. Um, hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?

06:10.036 --> 06:13.038
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.874
That's the situation as we know it.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.171
If you see him, could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.590
- You got it.
- Thanks.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.261
Thank you.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.352
Other wall, people! Other wall!

06:40.525 --> 06:42.901
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!

06:43.069 --> 06:45.195
- What are we gonna do?
- Okay, just be calm.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.531
For all he knows,
we're just hanging out.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.117
All right? So just be nonchalant.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.042
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.337
Okay, just hide.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.008
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.431
There's no room under the bed...

07:14.016 --> 07:18.186
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.321
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?
- Hi.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.866
I really don't.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.122
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.584
I don't believe this.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.921
- Have you guys been...?
- Shh! This is the listening side of the wall.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.513
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up...

07:53.681 --> 07:55.849
...and part of the reason
was she had feelings for me.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.809
Uh-huh, right. Yeah.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.062
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out
since the day I met her.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.774
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.444
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

08:07.653 --> 08:10.363
...oh, before you know it, we were kissing.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.866
How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?

08:13.242 --> 08:16.870
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.165
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.875
You would think.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.423
Joey?

08:28.591 --> 08:32.092
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?

08:33.596 --> 08:34.638
Psst!

08:34.804 --> 08:36.347
What? Hey!

08:36.515 --> 08:39.934
What are you...? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.937
Yeah!

08:42.605 --> 08:44.147
Now, what is this?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.526
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...

08:47.693 --> 08:52.113
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.

08:52.281 --> 08:55.742
No, no. Have you thought about
how complicated this could get?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.161
- What about Ross?
- Well, he's with Charlie now.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.915
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.919
And as his friend, I mean, don't you think
he deserves the same from you?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.925
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.555
Look, we appreciate all the advice...

09:16.722 --> 09:19.224
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.811
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.938
- Sure.
- Enunciate.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.357
Get out!

09:33.447 --> 09:35.365
Are they right?

09:36.492 --> 09:40.412
Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should...

09:40.580 --> 09:42.455
...hold off until we talk to Ross.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.502
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.296
Yeah, I think that would be best.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.216
So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.553
- Although...
- I like "although."

09:56.721 --> 09:59.556
- Uh...
- I mean, you know...

09:59.724 --> 10:03.101
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...

10:03.269 --> 10:05.061
...six years.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.105
Six years?

10:07.565 --> 10:11.026
Wow. That's almost as long as high school.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.783
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.493
Absolutely.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.246
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.583
I'm thinking about you.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.835
Yeah.

10:30.671 --> 10:34.966
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.762
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.097
Seriously, what is it?

10:42.683 --> 10:46.019
Nothing. It's really... It's nothing.
Come here. Come here.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.147
What's wrong?

10:50.274 --> 10:52.776
Ah. Sorry, I just, um...

10:52.943 --> 10:54.653
I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.408
Well, maybe I can help.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.417
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.256
- Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.139
- Hey. You guys ready to go?
- Hey.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.184
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.729
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.440
You're not supposed to take that.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.527
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.612
Learn about Jesus.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.742
- Hey!
- So did you talk to Joey?

11:42.910 --> 11:47.288
Uh, no. I couldn't find him.
I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

11:47.498 --> 11:51.251
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.878
Stop it.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.589
Ph.D.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.051
You're filthy.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.137
Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.389
Uh, actually, I think she went to the salon.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.933
Oh, yeah.
Oh, she went to the salon, all right.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.561
Check it out!

12:11.272 --> 12:13.356
Whose day just got better?

12:14.066 --> 12:16.109
Chandler!

12:17.611 --> 12:19.988
Hey! Aah.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.450
- What do you think?
- I think...

12:23.617 --> 12:26.327
- I think I can see your scalp.
- Ha, ha.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.413
Don't you just love it?

12:28.622 --> 12:31.875
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.546
It's, uh, something. You go, girlfriend.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.341
- You never said that in your life.
- Not once.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.634
I thought so.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.553
Oh, and listen to this.

12:47.850 --> 12:52.020
What do you know?
It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.200
Ooh.

13:05.409 --> 13:10.079
Wow, it's, uh, kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.083
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.420
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?

13:17.588 --> 13:21.591
Oh, I mean, I... Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.259
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.

13:24.762 --> 13:28.515
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
to sit with Allen lverson over there.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.774
Um, once we're in the air
and the captain turns off the seat belt sign...

13:37.942 --> 13:41.027
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.

13:42.363 --> 13:46.574
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.119
- Because items may shift during...
- Oh, you're not good at this.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.043
- Do you have to go home tonight?
- No, I think I could come over.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.587
- It's Saturday, right?
- Oh.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.130
What?

14:01.298 --> 14:04.968
- Um, I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.513
- I have a date.
- Wh...?

14:08.681 --> 14:14.227
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.189
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.234
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.987
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.822
Three months?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.408
Okay.

14:28.576 --> 14:33.454
This is none of my business, but, um,
how long are you gonna keep seeing her?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.833
I'll tell her that it's over
tonight at dinner. I promise.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.586
Oh, okay, good. You do that.

14:40.254 --> 14:45.008
When you get home, maybe there'll be
a special delivery package waiting for you.

14:45.759 --> 14:49.137
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.

14:51.056 --> 14:55.184
- Pull out the packing material...
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.361
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.781
He's in a good mood after
the flight attendant says "duty-free."

15:09.658 --> 15:11.367
Okay. Good luck.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.416
Ross is coming over. I think now
would be a good time to talk to him.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.794
Oh, I guess so. I'm just... I'm really nervous.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.380
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...

15:24.548 --> 15:26.132
...they'll probably be serving dinner.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.134
Ooh.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.262
Still nervous?

15:31.847 --> 15:34.474
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.809
- Hey, Rach, uh...
- Yeah?

15:36.977 --> 15:40.480
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.607
Good luck.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.113
- Hey. Ha.
- Hey.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.658
So I, um...

15:51.825 --> 15:54.369
I kind of need to talk to you about Charlie.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.539
- Yeah?
- Last night, after you guys broke up...

15:58.707 --> 16:02.377
- So sorry to hear about that, by the way.
- Hmm, yeah.

16:03.045 --> 16:07.799
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...

16:09.176 --> 16:10.635
Well...

16:11.178 --> 16:13.304
- You kissed.
- Wh...?

16:15.057 --> 16:17.141
What? Ha, ha.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.311
What? Ha, ha.
What would give you that idea?

16:20.521 --> 16:23.189
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.

16:24.525 --> 16:28.569
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.864
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
- What?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.575
It's okay. You know, look...

16:34.743 --> 16:37.870
...I totally understand, all right? You guys...

16:38.038 --> 16:42.834
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And...

16:43.002 --> 16:46.212
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.922
Yeah.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.928
- Now I have something...
- I am speechless.

16:55.222 --> 16:59.934
I mean, the fact that you would put
my happiness first like that, I mean...

17:00.102 --> 17:01.978
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?

17:02.146 --> 17:05.440
- Oh, well, look, before you go...
- No, I mean it.

17:05.648 --> 17:12.320
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.949
I am those things, yeah.

17:15.659 --> 17:21.914
I've known Chandler longer, so I think
of him as my best friend. But now...

17:23.291 --> 17:25.626
...I may have to rethink some stuff.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.336
Dude!

17:27.546 --> 17:31.841
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you...

17:34.178 --> 17:35.887
I can't think of anything. Ha, ha.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.683
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.230
- So hi.
- Hi.

17:46.398 --> 17:50.735
- So, you, uh, talked to Joey?
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.403
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.907
- Oh. So everything's okay? Oh.
- Oh, no, it's great.

17:56.075 --> 18:01.579
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
- Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.874
Well, I'm so excited about this.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.212
Really? Ha, ha. Excited?

18:09.379 --> 18:14.926
What, are you kidding? I have had
some very dirty dreams about this.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.306
Excuse me.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.523
You didn't tell him, did you?

18:28.690 --> 18:31.943
I couldn't. He was saying all these
really nice things about me.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.403
I didn't want him to get mad
and take them back.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.864
- I'm gonna edge out Chandler!
- Oh, God.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.451
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
to New York, I will tell him.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.453
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.725
- Hi, Mike's place.
- Hey, it's Mike.

19:04.935 --> 19:05.977
Ooh, that was fast.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.645
Oh, uh, no, she's not here yet.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.191
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.945
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
strap on a pair.

19:17.948 --> 19:22.743
Why don't you tell her that we got back
together. Women appreciate honesty.

19:22.911 --> 19:28.166
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYI.

19:29.334 --> 19:33.963
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.507
Her name's Precious?

19:36.675 --> 19:39.927
Is she a pure breed, or did you
pick her up at the pound? Ha, ha.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.389
I just want to give you a heads-up.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.974
Okay. And if she gets upset...

19:45.142 --> 19:47.268
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.488
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

20:00.782 --> 20:03.159
- I'm... I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

20:03.327 --> 20:07.371
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?

20:13.128 --> 20:16.380
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!

20:16.548 --> 20:18.507
Ow!

20:19.176 --> 20:21.427
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.596
So if you want people to see them...

20:23.764 --> 20:26.766
...you're not having them taken out,
say, at the break of dawn?

20:27.434 --> 20:31.020
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.273
Mm.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.359
Aah! Aah!

20:37.736 --> 20:39.987
You like that, right?

20:47.079 --> 20:50.289
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from 10.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.376
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
from Apocalypse Now.

20:54.461 --> 20:58.381
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

20:58.548 --> 21:02.176
Now that we're home, you don't have
that problem. If you think about it...

21:02.344 --> 21:04.178
I hate them.

21:04.972 --> 21:09.058
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did I? Let's refresh.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.395
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.565
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.027
Again, let's journey back.

21:20.362 --> 21:24.991
As I recall, Rachel said she had never
noticed the shape of your skull before.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.704
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.125
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.670
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.172
Ow!

21:40.799 --> 21:43.259
- Get yourself in the tooth?
- And the eye.

21:52.644 --> 21:58.482
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.736
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.739
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Green? Huh?

22:04.906 --> 22:08.993
Did she give you a bottle of
antidepressants again to use as a rattle?

22:10.287 --> 22:13.873
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.377
Ooh, hey, Emma, Daddy has some
presents for you, okay?

22:18.545 --> 22:20.379
I want you to wait right here.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.298
- Come here, sweetie.
- Oh.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.843
Ross, um, actually,
there's something that, uh...

22:26.011 --> 22:27.762
...I really need to talk to you about.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.597
Okay, shoot.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.683
Okay. Um, all right, here's the deal.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.603
Ah! Oh, no!

22:36.521 --> 22:41.567
- What is it?
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!

22:42.778 --> 22:47.239
- Uh, look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!

22:50.035 --> 22:52.161
Why? Why me?

22:52.746 --> 22:56.123
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?

22:57.667 --> 22:59.919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?

23:00.253 --> 23:01.379
Well, yeah, uh...

23:01.546 --> 23:05.508
- Look, it's about me and...
- Oh, not another one!

23:06.968 --> 23:11.722
Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!

23:13.433 --> 23:16.977
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?

23:18.980 --> 23:23.484
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
- Uh, you think?

23:27.489 --> 23:29.323
Okay. Bye.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.743
All right, so Mike's on his way over.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.956
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so...

23:37.124 --> 23:41.419
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.

23:42.254 --> 23:46.507
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...

23:46.675 --> 23:49.135
...are you guys getting back together
or something?

23:50.512 --> 23:52.221
All right.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.059
Susie... Can I call you Susie?

23:57.602 --> 23:59.603
My name is Precious.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.523
I can't say that.

24:02.691 --> 24:06.944
Um, Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

24:07.362 --> 24:11.365
Mike and I are back together.
And, um, unfortunately...

24:11.533 --> 24:15.244
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.

24:15.412 --> 24:22.084
He's very sorry about that, and wishes you
the best of luck in all your endeavors.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.755
I just can't believe this. Why?

24:27.007 --> 24:29.008
- Well, I don't...
- Why would he do this?

24:29.176 --> 24:31.927
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.180
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

24:34.389 --> 24:37.600
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

24:37.767 --> 24:40.853
Have some pride, for the love of God!

24:45.275 --> 24:48.360
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

24:48.570 --> 24:52.406
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.

24:52.574 --> 24:57.620
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.

24:57.954 --> 25:02.458
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!

25:07.047 --> 25:10.257
Look, Precious...

25:12.427 --> 25:16.305
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...

25:16.473 --> 25:18.974
...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.187
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.106
He was gonna break up with you
on your birthday?

25:26.274 --> 25:31.070
I don't like to kiss and tell,
but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.532
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't need him.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.701
I deserve to be treated with respect.

25:38.328 --> 25:43.999
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!

25:49.256 --> 25:51.340
You're welcome.

25:56.471 --> 26:00.516
Honey? You've been in there
for a long time. Is everything okay?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.601
Not really.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.897
I have a problem.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.609
Really? What happened?

26:10.819 --> 26:16.323
Well, I was dancing around
and singing "No Woman, No Cry"...

26:18.243 --> 26:20.452
...and, um, I got stuck.

26:21.037 --> 26:24.456
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move. Ha, ha.

26:30.547 --> 26:33.507
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.676
I guess so.

26:37.220 --> 26:41.974
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.396
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.108
- So? Did you, uh, tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...

26:51.276 --> 26:53.819
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.698
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
- No, no, no, no.

26:57.866 --> 27:01.368
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.

27:01.536 --> 27:04.622
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
all you have to do is go:

27:04.789 --> 27:06.498
"I didn't mean it.

27:08.126 --> 27:11.545
I'm so sorry."

27:14.132 --> 27:16.133
Yeah, because that's what we do.

27:16.343 --> 27:20.220
All right, all right, okay. Um, how about this?
How about this? Tomorrow...

27:20.388 --> 27:21.805
Mm-hm?

27:21.973 --> 27:25.476
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.353
Okay, that sounds fair.

27:27.562 --> 27:30.314
- That just means, once again, we can't...
- I know.

27:30.482 --> 27:34.360
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.

27:34.569 --> 27:38.572
- No! Pfft. Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.575
All right, so I guess
that means good night then.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.078
Yep. Good night.

27:44.245 --> 27:45.704
Oh.

27:51.211 --> 27:56.215
Good night.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.473
- Good night.
- Stop saying good night.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.683
Okay.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.289
I'm so sorry.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.298
Look what I found in the drawer.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.429
And you said I'd never wear this.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.933
Now that I untangled you,
how about you do a little something for me?

28:48.143 --> 28:51.937
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.

28:52.105 --> 28:57.276
- Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it.
- This is what I want to do.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.820
Okay.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.281
I just don't get why you like it so much.

29:03.533 --> 29:07.745
She's an FBI agent posing
as a beauty contestant!
