<i>Nick Savrinn,
I just wanted to let you know.</i>

I didn't touch him! Ask him.

Things have changed since we last met.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.580
Relax, partner. I'm in on it now.

The rabbit plan. Know all about it.
So's the CO.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.801
Why'd you take Abruzzi down there?

36:59.884 --> 37:02.512
I didn't take him down there!
He was just, he just turned up!

37:02.595 --> 37:05.098
- And the pedophile, he thinks he's in.
- I know. Tenemos <i>un</i> problema.

- Bellick.
- She's walking. That's a good sign.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.703
Yeah, astute observation.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.414
Maybe you'd like to share that
with the Governor.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.584
I was tense. I was just trying...

I told you.

I told you when you took this job, I knew
something like this was gonna happen.

Didn't I? I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

Well, sweetheart, I just want you to see
what you're doing to yourself.

You've never seen nothing like it.
Those little Hooker holes were right on.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.820
All right. Let's get everyone out of here.
Especially him.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.447
Getting him out of here.
I'm gonna take care of him myself.

- It's over. We don't need him no more.
- You're not gonna kill him.

walk out that front door?

- Yeah, me, too.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.398
Question.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.150
Why'd your department
assign inmates on Pl

41:32.407 --> 41:34.534
In the crawlspace in A-Wing.

41:36.661 --> 41:40.248
Pl didn't go there.
And we'd never assign inmates to do that.

- Okay, sorry.
- No problem.
