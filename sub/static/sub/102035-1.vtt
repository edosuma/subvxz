WEBVTT

01:27.722 --> 01:28.690
<i>Hello? Yes,</i>

01:28.723 --> 01:29.591
<i>thank you for accepting
the call.</i>

01:29.624 --> 01:30.959
Uh, can I speak to Greg Bernard,
please?

01:30.992 --> 01:33.861
<i>Mr. Reid,
Mr. Bernard isn't available.</i>

01:33.895 --> 01:35.462
All right, can you put me
through to his cellphone?

01:35.495 --> 01:37.130
It's urgent that I speak to him.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.733
There was a situation
in general population.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.233
It wasn't my fault,
but they sent me

01:40.267 --> 01:42.402
to solitary confinement
for it as punishment.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.105
<i>I apologize.
I can let Mr. Bernard know.</i>

01:45.305 --> 01:47.174
No, ma'am, just don't apologize.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.175
Just listen to me, okay?

01:48.208 --> 01:50.243
They... they've confiscated
all my belongings.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.347
I don't have anything,
not a pencil, not a paper.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.382
So unless Greg can help me
retrieve my things,

01:55.415 --> 01:56.818
I won't be able to mail out
my statement

01:56.851 --> 01:58.052
for petition to appeal.

01:58.086 --> 01:59.587
It was supposed to go out today
for my hearing next week.

01:59.621 --> 02:00.588
Do you understand?

02:01.689 --> 02:02.657
<i>I'm being informed</i>

02:02.690 --> 02:04.424
<i>that your hearing
was postponed.</i>

02:09.964 --> 02:13.601
Okay, okay. This is... excellent.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.770
Thank you.
When is it rescheduled for?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.672
How long do I have
to get my statement in to Greg?

02:18.740 --> 02:19.874
<i>I'm sorry, but</i>

02:21.075 --> 02:22.644
<i>your hearing has been
postponed indefinitely.</i>

02:28.883 --> 02:30.217
You said you were just informed.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.451
By who,
one of the other partners?

02:31.719 --> 02:32.954
Can I speak to one of them,
please?

02:32.987 --> 02:33.821
Put them on the phone.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.658
They... they're gonna send me
back to my cell.

02:36.691 --> 02:38.258
Can you put one of them
on the phone, please?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.460
<i>That's just not possible.</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:41.596
I don't think you understand me.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.264
They've given me a life sentence
and I'm innocent.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.298
This is not a joke.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.635
<i>Mr. Reid, I'm sorry.</i>

02:48.536 --> 02:49.904
Why do you keep
apologizing to me?

02:50.571 --> 02:51.739
Just put one of them
on the phone.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.642
<i>You should have
received notice in the mail.</i>

02:56.511 --> 02:58.445
<i>You're being sued
in civil court.</i>

02:59.647 --> 03:01.314
<i>Your assets have been frozen.</i>

03:01.348 --> 03:04.317
<i>And since you're technically
unable to pay,</i>

03:05.318 --> 03:08.723
<i>the firm has decided not
to move forward with your case.</i>

03:10.323 --> 03:11.693
Greg would not do that to me.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.462
We have been friends
since middle school.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.801
<i>I'm so sorry.
We sent you the documents</i>

03:19.834 --> 03:22.570
<i>so you can refile your appeal
with a public defender.</i>

03:23.838 --> 03:25.573
<i>Or you can represent yourself.</i>

03:26.808 --> 03:28.275
<i>I'm really very sorry.</i>

03:31.813 --> 03:32.880
Up against the wall.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.225
Let's walk.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.466
It's just a random check.

03:53.968 --> 03:54.869
For what?

03:55.703 --> 03:56.838
What's this?

04:02.810 --> 04:03.678
You know,

04:05.580 --> 04:09.449
there is nothing
that you can think of

04:09.483 --> 04:10.685
that I haven't thought first.

04:26.734 --> 04:27.735
Oh, what's wrong?

04:28.870 --> 04:31.471
I thought all dogs like
the smell of their own rectum.

04:32.507 --> 04:33.574
That's not mine.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.611
According to who?

04:37.678 --> 04:38.880
It's according to whom.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.517
Oh, it's according to whom.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.317
Really?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.057
Yeah.

04:50.992 --> 04:52.392
If you were smart
as you think you are,

04:52.425 --> 04:53.561
you wouldn't be here,

04:54.562 --> 04:55.730
would you, Dr. Reid?

04:57.999 --> 04:59.366
I read your file.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.468
I got a jacket on...

05:02.469 --> 05:04.739
all the inmates here in the SHU.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.440
I was already searched.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.943
Oh, not by me.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.848
You see, if I had to strip
searched you and this turned up

05:14.148 --> 05:15.950
stashed in your cavity,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.687
I would have shoved my boot
so far up your ass,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.454
this razor would have
come out of your mouth.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.723
Get up.

05:25.927 --> 05:27.394
First offense is 90 days.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.599
Anything like this
happens again,

05:32.733 --> 05:34.001
I'm gonna add on a whole year.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.667
Hey, you.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.872
You like to hurt women?

06:11.739 --> 06:15.009
Yeah, you know that's why Sacks
is fucking with you, right?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.813
Hey, friend,
with all due respect,

06:19.814 --> 06:20.715
it's been a long day.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.883
I really don't feel like
talking right now,

06:21.916 --> 06:24.819
so if you don't mind.

06:31.025 --> 06:32.059
Excuse me, guard.

06:32.093 --> 06:33.493
When do I get my belongings?

06:35.029 --> 06:36.664
My legal papers.
It's... it's urgent.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.531
I need them today.

06:38.633 --> 06:39.834
This ain't
the Four Seasons, motherfucker.

07:42.096 --> 07:43.564
Keep off the door!

07:49.603 --> 07:50.371
Goddammit, Zeke.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.973
Pull the mattress
off the window.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.911
Keep this up and you will
suffer the consequences.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.046
There's things going on
in this prison...

07:59.780 --> 08:01.916
This ain't right.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.553
The fucking bitches...

08:06.153 --> 08:08.022
Don't!

08:08.055 --> 08:09.023
Zeke!

08:10.057 --> 08:10.591
They're never gonna
let me out of here!

08:13.127 --> 08:15.963
- We're coming in.
- Three seconds.

08:15.997 --> 08:18.833
No, you come in here...

08:18.866 --> 08:19.867
Three.

08:22.903 --> 08:23.938
Two.

08:26.307 --> 08:28.075
One. Open the cell door.

08:28.309 --> 08:30.011
Don't!

08:30.044 --> 08:30.878
Zeke, Zeke!

08:30.911 --> 08:32.179
Get that bitch
away from me!

08:39.220 --> 08:40.221
Let go!

08:41.922 --> 08:43.557
You're breaking my fucking arm!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.760
You're breaking my arm!

08:45.793 --> 08:46.761
Fuck you!

08:50.031 --> 08:51.799
Show the warden some respect.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.000
Let go!

08:53.634 --> 08:55.302
Ow! You're fucking hurting me!

10:05.372 --> 10:06.340
Excuse me, guard.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.982
My tray, I don't think
I had a full portion.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.922
Can I have a little bit more?

10:29.730 --> 10:30.731
Please?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.309
Oh, don't you look nice.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.210
Sorry I'm late.

11:17.178 --> 11:18.045
It's okay.

11:19.413 --> 11:20.347
Understood.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.386
Careful.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.287
Thank you.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.227
Oh, look.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.197
It's our guardian angel.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.805
It's what we call pareidolia.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.441
Our brains are wired
to perceive faces in things.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.210
It's actually a form of
pattern recognition.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.215
Can't I just appreciate
the view?

11:57.818 --> 11:58.752
You don't think that that's...

11:58.786 --> 11:59.353
Interesting?

11:59.954 --> 12:00.487
Mm-mm.

12:06.093 --> 12:09.496
So, you didn't bring any clothes
to work in?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.200
I thought the whole point
of buying this boat

12:13.234 --> 12:14.902
was so that we can relax.

12:16.370 --> 12:17.838
We haven't even started.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.909
Baby, it's such a beautiful day.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.410
Why can't we just enjoy it?

12:35.089 --> 12:38.826
Why don't we take the boat out
for a lap around the bay,

12:39.493 --> 12:41.128
and then we'll work, I promise.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.903
We need this.

12:51.372 --> 12:52.507
We need what?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.247
To fix this.

13:23.137 --> 13:25.205
There's a passage
I'd like to share with you,

13:27.575 --> 13:30.911
one that occurs to me
in times like this.

13:33.180 --> 13:37.051
Let every man be subject
to the governing authorities

13:37.951 --> 13:40.387
for there is no authority
except from God.

13:41.355 --> 13:43.457
And those authorities
that do exist,

13:44.058 --> 13:46.226
have been instituted by God.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.162
Yeah.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.132
I don't like
the segregated housing unit.

13:54.468 --> 13:55.836
It changes people.

13:57.404 --> 14:01.609
Every time an inmate has to be
extracted, they call me down

14:03.377 --> 14:04.546
and I see it firsthand.

14:05.479 --> 14:07.615
That man in the cell
next to you, Zeke,

14:08.516 --> 14:12.152
he flooded out his cell
because he was desperate,

14:14.288 --> 14:16.123
desperate for human contact.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.228
I have a prison to run.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.431
I have a responsibility
to my staff

14:24.465 --> 14:27.234
and to the other inmates
to segregate the troublemakers.

14:27.502 --> 14:28.969
Oh, man.

14:41.949 --> 14:42.617
That's not mine.

14:43.518 --> 14:44.351
You know that.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.253
It was in your mattress.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.227
Maybe...
I can help you help yourself.

14:54.428 --> 14:56.631
If, for instance,
you were willing to enroll

14:56.664 --> 14:59.032
in a behavior modification
program,

15:00.167 --> 15:03.505
I can commute your stay
in the segregated housing unit.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.540
You would be able to reenter

15:05.573 --> 15:08.008
the general population
immediately.

15:08.743 --> 15:10.578
What does one have to do
to get into this program?

15:12.446 --> 15:13.914
Simple.

15:14.649 --> 15:16.984
Just obey the rules,

15:20.187 --> 15:21.255
and sign a confession.

15:25.727 --> 15:29.129
The road to rehabilitation
starts with acceptance.

15:40.107 --> 15:40.974
No.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.582
I heard about you,
Harlow.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.119
Any chance you can
move me to a new cell?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.488
You two deserve each other.

16:03.197 --> 16:05.132
Hey, black man.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.401
Do you believe in God?

16:30.658 --> 16:33.360
Hey, you, Harlow.

16:35.496 --> 16:37.364
I know you hear me, boy.

16:38.766 --> 16:40.768
I'm trying to save your life.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.272
How's that?

16:49.777 --> 16:51.245
If you got something to say,
say it.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.413
Otherwise, just leave me alone.

16:55.517 --> 16:58.485
Go to your cell door and
look out in the hallway.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.397
Do you see them lights,

17:11.431 --> 17:13.601
the long ones up there
on the ceiling?

17:14.536 --> 17:16.538
That's where they live.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.441
They feed on the energy
and travel through the vents.

17:22.276 --> 17:24.546
That's how they get
into the cells.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.683
Do you believe in ghosts?

17:30.818 --> 17:33.153
I'm afraid whatever it is
you think you're seeing,

17:34.488 --> 17:37.692
that's just your mind's way
of... of keeping you company.

17:37.892 --> 17:39.794
They ain't trying
to keep me company.

17:39.827 --> 17:41.328
They're trying to kill me!

17:43.765 --> 17:45.165
Who's trying to kill you?

17:46.366 --> 17:49.069
In here,
we all got victims.

17:49.537 --> 17:52.807
Some of those victims, the ones
who ain't with us no more,

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
they're looking for revenge.

18:03.518 --> 18:06.353
It sounds like you're having
a crisis of conscience.

18:06.921 --> 18:08.288
Shut up.

18:08.322 --> 18:09.489
You sound like a shrink.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.427
A psychiatrist, yes.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.697
Don't you try and
talk to me, motherfucker!

18:18.566 --> 18:20.535
Hey, I was not passing judgment.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.276
All right, you're the one
that said you wanted to talk.

18:31.345 --> 18:33.380
Why don't you tell me
something then?

18:33.548 --> 18:34.448
Like...

18:35.717 --> 18:38.753
how'd you kill your wife?

18:50.865 --> 18:52.466
I'm innocent!

18:59.707 --> 19:00.708
I'm innocent.

19:14.956 --> 19:17.625
So we're downstairs
and I hear this groaning.

19:17.659 --> 19:18.559
So I walk down the hall

19:18.593 --> 19:20.695
and I see this
big Mexican motherfucker.

19:20.995 --> 19:22.563
He's holding his cock
in one hand

19:22.597 --> 19:23.931
and squeezing his wrist with the
other,

19:23.965 --> 19:25.399
trying to cut
the circulation off.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.802
You know, apparently,
it feels like someone else

19:27.835 --> 19:29.336
is jerking you fuckin' off.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.572
I think
I'll have to try that.

21:19.647 --> 21:21.616
The sooner we resurface
this deck,

21:23.551 --> 21:25.019
the sooner that Amber sets sail.

21:45.106 --> 21:45.973
What?

22:03.958 --> 22:04.992
So,

22:06.594 --> 22:07.929
you do still love me?

24:01.842 --> 24:03.077
Free at last.

24:03.844 --> 24:05.713
Free at last.

24:18.092 --> 24:18.926
Sacks!

24:19.794 --> 24:21.929
Uh, Sacks, Sacks,
excuse me, please.

24:24.065 --> 24:25.967
I'm so sorry,
but can I just have, um...

24:27.668 --> 24:29.637
can I have a sharpened pencil,
please, something that works?

24:31.706 --> 24:32.807
You want a pencil, huh.

24:34.709 --> 24:36.510
Yeah, if it's not too much
trouble, that'd be nice.

24:36.544 --> 24:37.011
Thank you.

24:40.648 --> 24:42.016
How does it feel to want?

25:01.135 --> 25:02.903
<i>If you keep letting
them treat you like a bitch,</i>

25:03.871 --> 25:05.506
I'm gonna have to
take care of myself.

25:08.209 --> 25:10.277
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

25:19.653 --> 25:21.055
All right, all right.

25:30.631 --> 25:33.134
<i>Judge McCabe,
I am an innocent man</i>

25:33.167 --> 25:35.870
<i>serving a life sentence
in a federal penitentiary.</i>

25:35.903 --> 25:37.738
<i>I respectfully request
an opportunity</i>

25:37.772 --> 25:39.006
<i>to appeal my conviction.</i>

25:39.874 --> 25:40.975
Look at that!

25:41.008 --> 25:42.176
<i>It gives me great pleasure
to inform you</i>

25:42.209 --> 25:43.377
<i>that I have discovered evidence
within my case file</i>

25:43.411 --> 25:46.647
<i>that was never presented
at my original trial.</i>

25:47.915 --> 25:49.183
Fucking lawyers.

25:50.084 --> 25:51.719
<i>Due to the negligence
of my attorney,</i>

25:51.752 --> 25:53.054
<i>I've decided to act
as my own counsel</i>

25:53.087 --> 25:55.923
<i>and will be filing my petition
to appeal personally.</i>

25:56.323 --> 25:57.691
They're gonna get the truth,
Zeke.

25:57.958 --> 25:58.692
Soon enough.

26:00.294 --> 26:02.229
Go thank your friend, Harlow.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.135
I want you so bad right here.

26:08.803 --> 26:09.637
No.

26:09.670 --> 26:10.237
Right now.

26:10.271 --> 26:11.238
I'm sweating.

26:11.272 --> 26:11.939
Right now, I don't care
that you're sweating.

26:11.972 --> 26:14.308
Besides, people are gonna see.

26:14.341 --> 26:15.609
I don't care who sees.

26:17.178 --> 26:18.179
No, you can wait.

26:19.847 --> 26:21.816
This is what you get
for putting me to work.

26:26.287 --> 26:27.188
Suit yourself.

26:54.181 --> 26:56.150
You know what?
If you keep that up,

26:57.318 --> 26:59.253
<i>you might get
what you're looking for.</i>

28:13.127 --> 28:14.795
We got a pervert in the house!

28:18.332 --> 28:20.768
Five inmates
up and offed themselves

28:20.801 --> 28:22.369
in the last 24 months.

28:22.403 --> 28:24.905
No one even bats an eye.

28:24.939 --> 28:26.207
She ain't gonna stop.

28:26.807 --> 28:28.976
All she has to do
is keep us here.

28:29.009 --> 28:31.946
The SHU does all the work
for her.

29:01.008 --> 29:02.076
You got a message.

29:03.911 --> 29:04.878
I'll check it later.

29:05.513 --> 29:06.380
You sure?

29:07.915 --> 29:09.883
Yeah, whoever it is
can wait.

29:23.130 --> 29:24.131
Who was it?

29:26.834 --> 29:27.501
My mother.

29:29.103 --> 29:31.472
I told her not to call me
this weekend.

29:34.275 --> 29:35.142
What does she want?

29:39.013 --> 29:39.547
Mm.

29:43.618 --> 29:44.885
I'll call her later.

29:48.222 --> 29:48.989
You sure? You can just,

29:49.023 --> 29:50.324
you can call her now
if you want.

30:00.901 --> 30:01.569
What did she want?

30:08.510 --> 30:09.943
- What did she text you?
- Nothing.

30:11.912 --> 30:12.580
Nothing.

30:15.115 --> 30:16.116
Show me the text.

30:20.921 --> 30:22.323
I want you to show me
the message right now.

30:24.291 --> 30:25.859
<i>How does it feel to want?</i>

30:42.042 --> 30:43.043
No.

30:43.511 --> 30:44.345
It can't be.

30:45.279 --> 30:47.147
I've seen your face.

30:47.181 --> 30:47.881
What?

30:49.149 --> 30:51.018
You had a face like an angel's.

30:51.619 --> 30:53.621
What happened
to your beautiful face?

30:53.655 --> 30:56.390
Who the hell
are you talking to, Zeke?

30:57.925 --> 30:59.259
Oh, Goddammit!

30:59.293 --> 31:01.128
Stop! Stop looking at me!

31:02.096 --> 31:06.900
Get away from me!

31:12.072 --> 31:13.107
Help!

31:13.474 --> 31:14.542
Call the warden.

31:22.483 --> 31:23.217
What?

31:24.184 --> 31:25.285
Goddammit, Zeke,
what have you done?

31:25.687 --> 31:27.421
What is happening?

31:37.599 --> 31:38.399
Ezekiel!

31:40.501 --> 31:41.402
Zeke!

31:41.669 --> 31:42.637
What happened, man?

31:49.209 --> 31:50.110
Hello?

32:23.210 --> 32:25.212
<i>Judge McCabe,
please accept my apology</i>

32:25.245 --> 32:27.715
<i>for the time it's taken
to draft my personal statement</i>

32:27.749 --> 32:29.283
<i>and file for an appeal.</i>

32:30.184 --> 32:32.019
<i>It's become
increasingly difficult</i>

32:32.052 --> 32:34.254
<i>to obtain a suitable
writing utensil</i>

32:34.288 --> 32:35.557
<i>while serving time in the SHU.</i>

32:38.325 --> 32:42.530
Hey, Ezekiel!

32:43.665 --> 32:45.466
Sacks!

32:45.499 --> 32:48.268
Can I just get just
like a little bit more food?

32:56.578 --> 32:57.579
I demand

32:58.212 --> 33:00.180
a new pencil.

33:00.214 --> 33:01.381
How long you been up, Harlow?

33:01.583 --> 33:04.218
You can't stop me
from filing my appeal.

33:08.523 --> 33:10.525
I want my pencil.

33:11.358 --> 33:12.660
You don't look so good.

33:14.261 --> 33:15.530
Maybe you oughta just...

33:17.264 --> 33:18.265
lie down.

33:19.399 --> 33:20.367
Go to sleep.

33:21.068 --> 33:22.236
I want a pencil.

33:23.671 --> 33:24.471
Now.

33:29.276 --> 33:30.143
Hmm.

33:31.679 --> 33:32.780
Maybe tomorrow.

34:06.581 --> 34:09.817
Rule number one,
don't let nobody,

34:10.284 --> 34:12.319
nobody disrespect you
up in here.

34:14.154 --> 34:15.690
They don't know
what you're capable of,

34:17.157 --> 34:17.824
but I do.

34:21.194 --> 34:24.063
My nigga!

34:53.360 --> 34:58.432
I think today
is my birthday.

35:11.445 --> 35:12.580
Hey, yo, Zeke.

35:15.917 --> 35:16.718
Ezekiel!

35:17.919 --> 35:20.420
Is this your doing, Zeke?

35:48.850 --> 35:50.885
Harlow.

35:53.921 --> 35:57.157
Use the ink
that's flowing in your veins.

35:57.692 --> 35:58.926
Yo, Zeke, is that you?

36:02.597 --> 36:03.564
Man, man.

36:05.298 --> 36:07.434
You gonna leave me over here
alone like this, man?

36:54.015 --> 36:55.750
Not bad, not bad.

37:24.645 --> 37:26.547
<i>Judge McCabe,
I intend to prove</i>

37:26.581 --> 37:29.617
<i>that unfair racial profiling
led to my arrest,</i>

37:29.650 --> 37:30.852
<i>and the selection of a jury</i>

37:30.885 --> 37:33.654
<i>with preconceived notions
about my character.</i>

37:37.558 --> 37:40.928
<i>Requestioning key witnesses
will prove this theory.</i>

37:45.633 --> 37:48.335
<i>You should also know
there's a corrections officer</i>

37:48.368 --> 37:51.038
<i>here in the SHU
determined to silence me</i>

37:52.073 --> 37:53.608
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

38:03.718 --> 38:04.952
I just wanted to talk to my mom.

38:04.986 --> 38:06.954
I don't think there's anything
wrong with that.

38:06.988 --> 38:07.989
It's not gonna work like this.

38:08.689 --> 38:10.423
You are a control freak.

38:10.457 --> 38:12.693
You still don't get that
you brought this on yourself.

38:12.727 --> 38:14.427
Things were like this
before the affair.

38:15.596 --> 38:18.933
Everything I say to you,
you end up using it against me.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.702
You're constantly
looking over my shoulder

38:21.736 --> 38:24.071
and second-guessing
everything I do.

38:24.105 --> 38:25.372
What do you want?

38:28.142 --> 38:29.076
I don't want anything.

38:29.110 --> 38:29.944
You don't want anything?

38:29.977 --> 38:31.311
Then fuck off then!

38:32.713 --> 38:34.314
Why did you bring me here?

38:34.849 --> 38:37.785
Do you have any idea what
kind of man they'll think I am?

38:37.819 --> 38:39.587
I don't wanna be
analyzed by you.

38:39.787 --> 38:40.688
I just needed to talk.

38:41.923 --> 38:43.825
There's nothing wrong with me
talking to my own mother.

38:43.858 --> 38:45.560
You don't think that
she's gonna tell him?

38:45.593 --> 38:46.828
What do you care
what my father...

38:46.861 --> 38:47.595
Because!

38:48.830 --> 38:50.898
He gave me the money to start
my fucking practice, Amber!

38:50.932 --> 38:51.999
So this is about money.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.702
This is about me
not having to defend my choice

38:54.735 --> 38:55.736
not to leave you!

38:56.571 --> 38:57.939
I'm gonna make this
easy for you.

38:59.874 --> 39:00.608
Hey.

39:05.478 --> 39:06.781
To the window!

39:12.186 --> 39:15.556
When we call you to the window,
you get up and move.

39:18.059 --> 39:18.860
Get dressed.

39:31.038 --> 39:31.906
Mr. Reid.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.776
I have good news for you.

39:36.878 --> 39:39.547
Your time in the segregated
housing unit is up.

39:42.149 --> 39:43.885
I trust you're ready
to try again

39:43.918 --> 39:45.820
back in the general population.

39:46.954 --> 39:47.889
God, yes.

39:48.756 --> 39:49.624
Thank you.

39:50.892 --> 39:52.526
Thank God indeed.

39:55.863 --> 39:59.133
You'll have to spend a few weeks
in the step down unit.

40:03.738 --> 40:04.505
Good luck.

40:06.140 --> 40:08.475
Prepare the prisoner's
personal items.

40:09.143 --> 40:10.011
Yes, sir.

40:10.745 --> 40:11.746
Officer Sacks.

40:16.083 --> 40:16.918
Thank you.

40:17.752 --> 40:18.653
Thank you.

40:23.758 --> 40:24.759
Warden.

40:25.492 --> 40:26.627
What is it, Mr. Reid?

40:28.162 --> 40:29.429
What happened to Zeke?

40:29.830 --> 40:30.698
Zeke.

40:32.767 --> 40:35.770
If I were you, I wouldn't
concern myself with him.

40:40.775 --> 40:41.642
Come on.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.660
Face the bars, prisoner.

41:49.043 --> 41:50.011
You know, if...

41:51.112 --> 41:52.613
if things were different,

41:54.782 --> 41:56.617
I might actually have been able
to help you.

41:59.920 --> 42:00.821
Huh/

42:01.922 --> 42:03.624
Too bad there's not
a couch in here, huh, Harlow?

42:05.726 --> 42:06.260
Go on.

42:15.603 --> 42:17.905
I hope whoever cut you
got what they deserved.

42:20.741 --> 42:21.609
Two years.

42:22.943 --> 42:24.045
Two years in the SHU

42:24.078 --> 42:25.746
plus the time
he'd already served.

42:27.348 --> 42:29.250
And every night, I go home,
look in the mirror,

42:29.283 --> 42:30.651
and think to myself

42:32.219 --> 42:35.022
if today that sorry excuse
for a human being

42:35.056 --> 42:39.093
just happened to,
you know, stop breathing,

42:41.328 --> 42:43.798
I'd be doing the world
a huge favor.

42:49.003 --> 42:51.305
And every day, I decided
I was better than that,

42:52.339 --> 42:53.908
so I did nothing.

42:56.644 --> 42:57.878
You did the right thing.

43:03.851 --> 43:04.785
Piece of shit.

43:05.853 --> 43:07.688
Eventually got out on parole.

43:10.391 --> 43:13.661
Within a few months, he was
back to his lowlife ways,

43:13.694 --> 43:15.763
driving around
with a truck full of drugs.

43:15.796 --> 43:17.932
Cops pursued him
for almost 26 miles.

43:20.067 --> 43:21.802
Finally, he lost control.

43:33.447 --> 43:35.649
He plowed into
a 13-year-old girl

43:35.683 --> 43:37.151
waiting for a school bus.

43:40.688 --> 43:41.856
That's when I knew,

43:47.461 --> 43:48.929
people like him...

43:58.038 --> 43:59.640
...people like you...

44:02.910 --> 44:05.045
don't deserve second chances.

44:13.287 --> 44:16.290
You will be back in the SHU,
Harlow.

44:20.427 --> 44:22.329
And you'll do the dirty work
for me,

44:26.433 --> 44:27.334
just like...

44:29.203 --> 44:30.070
the guy...

44:33.340 --> 44:34.441
who gave me this.

44:38.045 --> 44:41.682
I can't wait to see you
swinging from your bed sheet.

44:45.219 --> 44:46.086
For me,

44:48.455 --> 44:50.057
that's justice enough.

46:04.198 --> 46:06.066
[thudding

46:18.546 --> 46:19.446
Hey!

46:26.453 --> 46:28.222
On your knees,
convict, now!

46:30.057 --> 46:30.991
Don't move!

47:10.064 --> 47:11.231
- What did she text you?
- Nothing.

47:13.334 --> 47:14.201
Nothing.

47:16.538 --> 47:17.471
Show me the text.

47:18.472 --> 47:19.473
I want you to show me
the message right now.

47:23.277 --> 47:24.311
I needed to talk.

47:24.345 --> 47:25.479
<i>I needed to talk to my mom</i>

47:25.513 --> 47:26.614
and there's nothing wrong
with that.

47:26.648 --> 47:28.482
And every time
I try to talk to you,

47:28.516 --> 47:30.150
you end up using
everything against me.

47:30.384 --> 47:31.285
You're looking over my shoulder

47:31.318 --> 47:33.220
and you're second-guessing
everything I do.

47:33.253 --> 47:34.556
And it's not gonna work
like this.

47:34.589 --> 47:36.090
No, you're right,
it's not gonna work this way

47:36.490 --> 47:37.991
'cause you still don't get...

47:39.460 --> 47:40.461
that you brought this
on yourself.

47:58.212 --> 48:00.080
<i>Welcome back, Harlow.</i>

48:01.583 --> 48:03.618
<i>Looks like Officer Sacks</i>

48:03.651 --> 48:08.656
<i>gave you more than</i>
<i>just a pencil.</i>

48:39.286 --> 48:40.655
Harlow, you hungry?

48:43.390 --> 48:44.659
Help!

48:45.225 --> 48:46.326
Help!

48:48.530 --> 48:51.298
You just earned yourself
another 90 days, prisoner.

48:51.599 --> 48:52.399
No!

48:54.769 --> 48:55.502
No!

48:55.670 --> 48:56.638
- Get up.
- No!

48:57.505 --> 48:59.273
- No!
- Go get yourself cleaned up.

48:59.574 --> 49:01.108
- We should call psych.
- No, no, no.

49:05.479 --> 49:06.947
Pull back, prisoner!

49:07.414 --> 49:08.315
You go ahead and get cleaned up.

49:08.348 --> 49:09.983
I got this.
I'll take care of the trays.

49:10.317 --> 49:11.051
Fine.

49:11.586 --> 49:12.654
I'll be right back.

49:22.095 --> 49:24.632
If you're gonna act
like an animal,

49:25.800 --> 49:27.501
I'm gonna treat you
like an animal.

49:30.370 --> 49:31.238
Please.

49:37.478 --> 49:38.378
Eat up, Harlow.

49:47.454 --> 49:48.989
I would rather starve.

49:52.259 --> 49:53.494
I can wait if you can.

50:20.220 --> 50:22.055
<i>I tried to tell you, man.</i>

50:26.728 --> 50:28.495
Fuck Sacks.

50:36.538 --> 50:39.072
Trust in God.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.576
<i>I can't wait to see you</i>

50:41.609 --> 50:43.678
<i>swinging from your bed sheet.</i>

50:44.478 --> 50:45.813
Shank that bitch in the neck.

50:50.217 --> 50:51.853
<i>You had a face like an angel.</i>

50:51.886 --> 50:54.154
<i>What happened
to your beautiful face?</i>

50:55.823 --> 50:57.224
<i>Do you love me?</i>

50:57.625 --> 50:58.526
<i>You know.</i>

50:58.560 --> 50:59.594
<i>You know, Harlow.</i>

50:59.627 --> 51:00.828
<i>You know what you did.</i>

51:01.328 --> 51:03.063
Sign a confession.

52:27.749 --> 52:28.415
Thank you.

52:32.352 --> 52:33.220
Yes.

53:04.317 --> 53:05.620
Just the way I like it.

53:07.955 --> 53:09.256
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

53:29.476 --> 53:31.512
You're trying to bait me into
being the kind of man

53:31.546 --> 53:32.747
that you think that you deserve.

53:32.780 --> 53:35.516
When I spoke to my mother,
it was in a moment of weakness.

53:35.550 --> 53:36.984
You don't get to call it
a moment of weakness

53:37.018 --> 53:39.286
when you can't get through
an entire day

53:39.620 --> 53:40.855
without having a breakdown.

53:41.622 --> 53:43.290
Have you been taking the pills
that I gave you?

53:43.858 --> 53:45.325
There's nothing wrong with me.

53:45.893 --> 53:47.562
You don't like the way
that you feel without them.

53:47.829 --> 53:51.264
The issue
will not resolve itself, Amber.

53:51.298 --> 53:54.969
The issue is that I don't like
the way you treat me.

53:57.071 --> 53:57.839
Stop!

53:58.305 --> 53:59.439
Respect me.

54:04.011 --> 54:04.879
I'm sorry.

54:05.646 --> 54:06.246
<i>I don't understand.</i>

54:06.279 --> 54:07.615
<i>What is it you want?</i>

54:09.784 --> 54:10.718
To get outta here.

54:17.457 --> 54:18.391
Zeke.

54:18.593 --> 54:20.327
<i>Zeke, yeah, Zeke.</i>

54:20.795 --> 54:21.963
<i>What you want, Harlow?</i>

54:22.362 --> 54:23.898
<i>If we was anywhere else
but here,</i>

54:23.931 --> 54:26.033
<i>you wouldn't even give me
the time of day.</i>

54:26.934 --> 54:29.504
<i>You're just one of them
fair-weathered friends,</i>

54:29.537 --> 54:30.571
<i>ain't you, Harlow?</i>

54:32.006 --> 54:33.007
No, I'm not.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.454
You got this, motherfucker.

54:50.858 --> 54:51.993
Come on, Harlow.

54:54.662 --> 54:55.730
Man the fuck up!

54:56.764 --> 54:58.833
We gonna be in here
for the rest of our lives.

54:58.866 --> 55:01.068
Better get used to this.

55:02.737 --> 55:04.605
You part of the statistic now.

55:05.438 --> 55:08.009
One in three, that's your ass.

55:08.876 --> 55:09.811
Plus my ass.

55:09.844 --> 55:14.882
That's two, 2.3 million
motherfuckers in jail,

55:14.916 --> 55:16.050
behind bars!

55:16.584 --> 55:17.685
You're one of 'em.

55:17.718 --> 55:18.753
You a slave.

55:18.786 --> 55:20.555
They took away the chains,
put them shits back on

55:20.822 --> 55:21.923
'cause you fucked up!

55:21.956 --> 55:22.723
No.

55:22.990 --> 55:23.925
This is your fault.

55:24.792 --> 55:26.661
It was an accident
and you know that.

55:26.694 --> 55:27.562
You,

55:28.830 --> 55:29.730
you bad.

55:31.532 --> 55:32.399
You know.

55:33.601 --> 55:34.101
No.

55:35.102 --> 55:35.970
You know.

55:38.673 --> 55:39.472
You know.

55:40.407 --> 55:41.776
<i>Harlow, you guilty as hell.</i>

55:41.809 --> 55:43.511
<i>You might as well cop to it.</i>

55:54.522 --> 55:55.388
Zeke?

55:58.458 --> 55:59.126
Zeke?

56:00.027 --> 56:01.394
Talk to me, Zeke.

56:03.164 --> 56:04.599
You're all that I have.

56:04.999 --> 56:05.733
What?

56:08.736 --> 56:09.937
I didn't do it.

56:11.005 --> 56:12.006
I didn't do it.

56:12.506 --> 56:13.741
I didn't do it.

56:15.943 --> 56:17.945
No, I didn't...

56:20.815 --> 56:21.883
What's happening to me?

56:28.890 --> 56:30.490
Did I fucking do it?

56:37.031 --> 56:38.465
I didn't do it.

56:40.601 --> 56:41.501
I didn't do it.

56:41.535 --> 56:42.402
What?

56:44.906 --> 56:46.007
Oh, my God.

56:46.908 --> 56:47.875
Oh, my God.

56:49.043 --> 56:50.011
Oh, my God.

56:51.078 --> 56:52.412
I didn't do it.

56:52.880 --> 56:54.115
I... no.

56:54.148 --> 56:54.916
What?

56:55.482 --> 56:56.617
What?

57:25.746 --> 57:27.114
Respect...

57:27.682 --> 57:28.516
- me.
- Stop it.

58:44.158 --> 58:44.792
Are you okay?

58:45.159 --> 58:45.993
Are you okay?

59:48.355 --> 59:49.156
I did it.

59:49.690 --> 59:50.157
I did it.

59:53.928 --> 59:55.129
I killed my wife.

59:56.697 --> 59:58.232
I wanna do the program.

01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:03.704
You killed your wife and
now you wanna make a deal?

01:00:03.737 --> 01:00:04.338
Yeah.

01:00:05.005 --> 01:00:05.873
Yes.

01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:07.808
Yes.

01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:09.376
Yes.

01:00:10.344 --> 01:00:11.645
Thank you, yes.

01:00:12.179 --> 01:00:13.047
Please.

01:00:14.882 --> 01:00:16.050
Get me outta here.

01:00:19.353 --> 01:00:20.321
Not on my watch.

01:00:27.328 --> 01:00:28.662
<i>Get the fuck away from me.</i>

01:00:28.696 --> 01:00:29.396
<i>Wait, wait, wait, no, no.</i>

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.231
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:35.636
<i>No! No, no, no.</i>

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:07.668
Warden!

01:01:07.868 --> 01:01:09.670
I'm ready to do the program!

01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:11.172
Come get me!

01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:13.941
I'm ready!

01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:16.410
Come get me!

01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:18.445
I'm ready to do the program!

01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:22.082
I'm ready to accept
responsibility for my actions!

01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:23.284
Come on!

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:24.852
Come on and get me!

01:01:25.052 --> 01:01:27.021
Come get me!

01:01:27.755 --> 01:01:28.789
Let me out!

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.257
Let me out!

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:31.792
Let me out!

01:01:32.159 --> 01:01:33.027
Let me out!

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.861
Please.

01:01:53.948 --> 01:01:54.748
Come on!

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:57.751
Warden!

01:01:58.319 --> 01:01:59.086
Yes!

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.487
Come get me!

01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:05.259
Come on!

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.995
I wanna see the warden!

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:16.303
Help!

01:02:16.337 --> 01:02:17.505
I need help!

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.342
Get me out of here!

01:02:21.942 --> 01:02:22.910
I'm done!

01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:24.144
I'm done!

01:02:24.478 --> 01:02:27.748
Lord Jesus Christ,
please have mercy on us.

01:02:31.118 --> 01:02:32.353
Stop, stop.

01:02:32.886 --> 01:02:33.354
Stop it.

01:02:49.336 --> 01:02:50.838
I'll never let you go.

01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:35.008
Stand up, prisoner.

01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:36.644
Please.

01:04:37.512 --> 01:04:38.946
I'll sign whatever you want,
please.

01:04:38.979 --> 01:04:40.948
Just get me Perez.

01:04:51.091 --> 01:04:51.959
Get him cleaned up.

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:53.327
Go!

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.094
Right away, sir.

01:05:19.654 --> 01:05:22.156
<i>We need to fix this.</i>

01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:28.929
<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

01:05:51.653 --> 01:05:53.153
You're making
the right decision.

01:05:54.087 --> 01:05:56.056
We'll be able to get you
into a program

01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:57.191
within a couple of weeks.

01:06:04.097 --> 01:06:04.998
Get away from me, please.

01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:06.133
Mr. Reid.

01:06:08.101 --> 01:06:09.970
Stop wasting everyone's time.

01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:17.377
Uncuff the prisoner.

01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:28.590
Respect...

01:06:29.323 --> 01:06:30.224
- me.
- Stop it.

01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:40.100
If you are not going to sign
the document,

01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:41.401
you need to go back
to your cell.

01:06:58.586 --> 01:06:59.621
I'm walking away.

01:07:01.523 --> 01:07:02.524
Mr. Reid?

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:31.218
No!

01:07:44.732 --> 01:07:46.433
Take the prisoner
back to the SHU.

01:07:52.472 --> 01:07:53.508
Stop this at once!

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:54.207
Let her go.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.311
Drop the weapon.

01:07:57.745 --> 01:08:00.147
Remove the pen from
Officer Sacks's throat.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.784
She's trying
to make me kill myself.

01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:06.588
No idea how crazy you sound.

01:08:06.621 --> 01:08:08.355
Officer Sacks, not another word!

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.657
She's torturing me.

01:08:09.691 --> 01:08:10.692
She's torturing Zeke.

01:08:11.191 --> 01:08:12.159
I'm not the only one.

01:08:12.794 --> 01:08:15.195
Harlow, Zeke is dead.

01:08:18.933 --> 01:08:20.200
Just listen to me, okay?

01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.435
Just watch the security tapes!

01:08:22.804 --> 01:08:25.506
She's trying
to turn my mind against me!

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.841
I'm not going back there
with her.

01:08:26.874 --> 01:08:28.442
I will look into this.

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:31.178
- Trust God.
- If you're a man of God,

01:08:31.211 --> 01:08:32.546
then check
the damn security tapes.

01:08:35.448 --> 01:08:36.584
I'm begging you.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:39.854
You have my word.

01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:41.154
Just let go.

01:08:42.389 --> 01:08:43.256
I can't.

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:45.593
Let go.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.495
Let go, Harlow.

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:51.566
Let go.

01:08:52.734 --> 01:08:53.533
Let go.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:00.273
Sacks!

01:09:00.808 --> 01:09:01.809
Stand down!

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:06.814
Get out.

01:09:18.725 --> 01:09:20.528
I'll take the prisoner
back to his cell, sir.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:30.337
Last chance.

01:09:32.272 --> 01:09:33.841
I might be guilty
of a lot of things,

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:40.548
but I know I am not guilty
of killing my wife.

01:10:12.613 --> 01:10:13.715
<i>While serving hard time</i>

01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:14.982
<i>for a crime that never was,</i>

01:10:15.016 --> 01:10:17.552
<i>my memories of the past
have been stolen from me,</i>

01:10:18.318 --> 01:10:19.854
<i>replaced with
violent delusions,</i>

01:10:20.822 --> 01:10:23.356
<i>delusions that better serve
a new version of me,</i>

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:26.259
<i>the version of me
writing this letter,</i>

01:10:26.794 --> 01:10:27.962
<i>spawned by the SHU.</i>

01:10:29.296 --> 01:10:30.330
<i>Without human contact,</i>

01:10:30.363 --> 01:10:32.567
<i>my mind calls upon
corrupted memories</i>

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.937
<i>to convince itself the man
I once was never existed</i>

01:10:36.804 --> 01:10:38.271
<i>and the animal I fight
every day</i>

01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:40.875
<i>not to become is who I am.</i>

01:10:42.409 --> 01:10:45.445
<i>I will never stop fighting
to remain the man I truly am,</i>

01:10:45.847 --> 01:10:46.981
<i>a loving husband,</i>

01:10:47.715 --> 01:10:48.850
<i>an esteemed doctor,</i>

01:10:50.317 --> 01:10:50.952
<i>a free man.</i>

01:10:52.553 --> 01:10:55.288
<i>Judge McCabe,
I beg the court to allow me</i>

01:10:55.322 --> 01:10:57.457
<i>the opportunity
to appeal my conviction,</i>

01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.560
<i>present a new case,</i>

01:11:00.661 --> 01:11:02.295
<i>and prove my innocence
once and for all.</i>

01:11:23.483 --> 01:11:25.052
I'll mail the letter personally.

01:11:34.629 --> 01:11:35.428
Dr. Reid.

01:11:43.538 --> 01:11:44.972
<i>What's wrong, Harlow?</i>

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.708
<i>You don't wanna talk to me
no more?</i>

01:11:48.509 --> 01:11:49.376
Shh.

01:11:51.512 --> 01:11:52.980
Shh.

01:11:55.616 --> 01:11:56.483
Shh.

01:11:57.384 --> 01:11:59.053
Look at you.
I'm so proud of you, man.

01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:02.657
Only way
you're going to survive this

01:12:02.924 --> 01:12:03.858
is with me.

01:12:04.692 --> 01:12:06.093
You got a long road
ahead of you.

01:12:34.856 --> 01:12:35.957
Are you ready for court?

01:12:54.809 --> 01:12:55.610
Psst.

01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:58.478
Guess who.

01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:45.826
Dr. Reid.
