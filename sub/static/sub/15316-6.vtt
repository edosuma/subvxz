00:08.608 --> 00:11.873
Sanctuary One
to Lophelia, do you copy?

00:12.479 --> 00:13.912
Still no answer, mom.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.914
Take us down.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

00:25.291 --> 00:26.451
You see anybody?

00:26.559 --> 00:28.652
Let's hope they're below.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.898
What did the message
say exactly?

00:40.373 --> 00:43.570
Just that Eric was bringing back
something we'd never seen before,

00:43.676 --> 00:45.871
and we were to meet him
in the harbor.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.812
Only they never made it to the dock.

01:00.093 --> 01:01.720
It's Eric.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.255
Yeah.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.558
Make sure Will is covered.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.167
Come on.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.307
Ugh.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.528
Six dead.

01:36.896 --> 01:41.230
They weren't just killed,
they were half devoured.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.600
Whatever it was,
it was powerful.

02:12.765 --> 02:15.893
Whatever specimens
were in these are long gone.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.733
Makes you wonder
what was in these cages.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.370
You think they could've
broken their way out?

02:25.545 --> 02:29.413
Looks more like something
clawed or chewed its way in.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.990
Mom, come check this out.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.584
- Tranquilizer rounds only.
- Are you sure?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.622
Eric paid with his life
to bring this creature back.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.520
- We owe it to him to preserve it.
- We owe it to him to kill it.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.055
Now I know why Eric was so excited
about these creatures.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.635
Their hyper camouflage
makes them all but invisible.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.534
Plus the fact that it's present
in both the predator

04:32.639 --> 04:33.697
and the smaller abnormal.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.273
The Nubbins.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.077
You going to make me ask?

04:39.178 --> 04:40.440
Ashley's name for them.

04:40.713 --> 04:44.979
Scientific name Nubina Atelerix,
according to Eric's log.

04:45.084 --> 04:46.517
Do we know what triggers
this camouflage?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.383
It seems to be a function
of both fear and aggression.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.850
That makes sense.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.391
Hide to avoid being stalked,
and as an aid to the hunt.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.051
So obviously
it was the predator

04:55.161 --> 04:57.254
who was responsible
for killing Eric and his crew.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.388
Actually, track wounds
of each of the victims

04:59.499 --> 05:01.330
show biological evidence
of both species.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.527
Come on, there's no way
those adorable little things

05:03.636 --> 05:04.660
could have attacked anybody.

05:04.837 --> 05:05.701
I'm not saying that they did.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.273
So how could they have left trace
on the bodies?

05:08.374 --> 05:11.172
I'm theorizing that some
of the Nubbins might have escaped

05:11.277 --> 05:13.643
and survived by feeding
on the dead crew members,

05:13.746 --> 05:16.340
hence the mingling of the DNA.

05:16.549 --> 05:17.982
Well, that's creepy.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.984
What's creepy
is that a bunch of them

05:20.086 --> 05:22.077
were eaten
by that nasty-ass monster.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.748
All but our two little survivors,
probably on their way

05:24.857 --> 05:26.848
to becoming the carnivore's
next meal.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.959
I'm going to go see
how they're doing.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.396
You okay?

05:41.674 --> 05:45.371
Eric was one of the world's
great hunters of abnormals.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.878
He called them
"Evolution's experiments. "

05:49.315 --> 05:51.510
Am I reading
a personal relationship?

05:52.919 --> 05:54.978
I don't want to see
his sacrifice go to waste.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.761
Henry...

06:07.867 --> 06:10.131
Have you had a chance
to check out my Nubbins?

06:12.905 --> 06:13.837
Oh, you mean the...

06:14.707 --> 06:16.834
No, but I would like to.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.412
Hey...

06:23.516 --> 06:26.747
Oh, guys, come on,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.214
Oh, man, I think I'm allergic.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.585
Well, you better get used to them.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.251
They're the coolest thing
we ever brought back.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.425
Hey...

06:39.532 --> 06:43.969
Huh, well, I got to admit,
your Nubbins are pretty amazing.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.230
Don't you just
want to squeeze them?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.304
Hey...

06:51.411 --> 06:52.935
You find anything out
about our predator?

06:53.045 --> 06:54.808
I'm still running the DNA.

06:54.914 --> 06:58.145
It'll take a few days before
we can complete the analysis.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.343
So what's going on?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.988
We have a rather odd situation
on our hands.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.353
Isn't "rather odd"
sort of your stock in trade?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.986
A gentleman by the name
of Maurice Macrae,

07:10.096 --> 07:12.530
recently deceased,
stipulated in his will

07:12.698 --> 07:15.098
that I perform the autopsy
on his remains.

07:15.635 --> 07:16.397
Why?

07:16.502 --> 07:19.630
He spent the last years of his life
in a psychiatric institution,

07:19.739 --> 07:21.297
convinced he was an abnormal.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.900
And how did he know about you?

07:23.075 --> 07:24.906
That's a question I have,
as well.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.312
Well, I guess
it's too late to ask him.

07:27.547 --> 07:31.643
True, but his granddaughter, Sophie,
has accompanied his body.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.219
I was hoping you could talk to her,
put her at ease,

07:34.320 --> 07:36.254
while I examine
her grandfather.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.913
What does she know
about the Sanctuary?

07:38.090 --> 07:40.320
Only the rumors
that her grandfather passed along.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.560
Everyone was convinced that he was
a few cups shy of a tea service.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.293
Everyone but Sophie.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.027
So you're going to go through
with the postmortem?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.466
Of course.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.671
If his claims
are unfounded, well...

07:53.773 --> 07:56.742
There's no harm in fulfilling
the man's final request.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.437
Hi.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.682
You must be Sophie.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.979
I'm Dr. Zimmerman.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.075
Will.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.984
You work with Dr. Magnus?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.714
I do.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.655
- My condolences.
- Thank you, Doctor.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.093
Do you mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

08:19.198 --> 08:20.859
I already know
what you're going to say,

08:20.967 --> 08:23.765
that my grandfather
was an eccentric old man.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.200
Actually, no, I don't know
anything about him.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.529
Sorry.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.303
It's just, all the doctors said

08:31.410 --> 08:35.107
he was suffering
from advanced dementia,

08:35.214 --> 08:38.513
and my parents, all my relatives
think he was crazy.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.416
But you didn't.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.679
He just felt so strongly.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.851
I loved him very much.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.224
How did he come to this...
Decision?

08:52.632 --> 08:57.899
Well, he always talked
about a private research facility.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.633
He called it "The Sanctuary,"

09:01.741 --> 09:04.710
a place where
what he called "abnormals"

09:04.877 --> 09:06.435
were given refuge.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.071
Of course, no one
took him seriously.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.449
Is that what goes on here?

09:12.318 --> 09:16.618
Well, we are
a private research facility.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.783
Research into what, exactly?

09:22.862 --> 09:24.193
A range of things.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.263
A "range. "

09:27.433 --> 09:30.664
Why don't you tell me
more about your grandfather?

09:30.770 --> 09:35.673
My grandfather could see things
that other people didn't,

09:36.142 --> 09:38.474
that other people couldn't.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.513
When we spent time together,
it was...

09:43.049 --> 09:46.314
...it was like the world
would open up.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.581
Sounds like an inspiring man.

09:49.956 --> 09:54.154
I mean, he showed me
what people were thinking,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.091
what they were feeling.

09:56.262 --> 10:01.290
So he actually imparted
these thoughts or sensations?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.564
Eh, you're humoring me.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.596
No, I'm not.
I'm just asking questions.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.196
It's fine. I'm used to it.

10:09.175 --> 10:12.736
Dr. Zimmerman, look, I'm sorry,
if you're going to be so evasive,

10:12.845 --> 10:16.042
I really don't see any reason
to tell you more than I have.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.146
Okay.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.983
Dr. Magnus has made arrangements
for you to stay here,

10:22.088 --> 10:24.056
as long as you're comfortable
with that,

10:24.156 --> 10:25.748
until the autopsy results come in.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.390
Thank you.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.968
You have something
against sleep, don't you?

10:37.069 --> 10:39.264
Just doing some reading.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.705
There's a recurring legend amongst
equatorial rainforest cultures

10:42.808 --> 10:44.366
about Nubbins.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.742
Nubbins? I thought
Ashley made that name up.

10:47.847 --> 10:51.305
She did. They're most often
called "Amoratas. "

10:51.417 --> 10:53.180
Apparently the species
is highly prized

10:53.285 --> 10:55.913
as harbingers of fertility
and a bountiful harvest.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.456
In some societies,
they were a common wedding gift,

10:58.624 --> 11:00.615
to promote connubial bliss.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.385
Before the age of self-help books.

11:03.963 --> 11:07.364
When they vanish, it's considered
a portent of discord.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.366
How did the, uh...

11:12.938 --> 11:17.841
...the autopsy go
on Sophie's grandfather?

11:18.277 --> 11:19.301
Sorry?

11:20.880 --> 11:21.869
Um...

11:21.981 --> 11:23.676
The autopsy?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.339
Oh.

11:25.451 --> 11:29.444
There was a significant anomaly
to the frontal lobe.

11:29.555 --> 11:33.685
I'll need to do more tests
to determine if it's a tumor or...

11:33.793 --> 11:35.260
...something else.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.596
So it's...
It's possible that he's an abnormal?

11:40.299 --> 11:42.062
Too early to tell, really.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.306
I'm, uh...

11:55.147 --> 11:56.546
I'm going to go to bed.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.179
Sweet dreams.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.948
Don't forget to put out the fire.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.447
I never do.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.122
Alright. Okay.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.531
Are the Nubbins okay?

12:22.641 --> 12:24.700
Henry said the female kept
going in and out of camo mode,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.778
and then swelled up
like a blimp.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.870
She gave birth just after dawn.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.679
They're all fine, all 14 of them.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.413
It took them only minutes
to adapt their camouflage.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.800
The juveniles are putting
on weight so fast

12:51.904 --> 12:54.930
I'm projecting they'll reach
maturation within a day.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.770
That rate of metabolic growth
is scary.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.674
We should find a way
to discourage their mating.

12:59.845 --> 13:03.144
Not yet. I want to document
a full reproductive cycle first.

13:03.249 --> 13:06.218
I'm keeping this one as a pet,
just so you know.

13:06.318 --> 13:07.751
You know, in the throes
of a breeding cycle,

13:07.853 --> 13:09.548
they may not be as docile
as they look.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.681
Oh, come on, I can handle
a baby Nubbin, mom.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.953
Right, wittle guy?
You're so cute.

13:15.261 --> 13:16.819
What about the predator?

13:17.062 --> 13:19.792
He showed marked signs of agitation
throughout the night.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.096
Only came out of camouflage
for all but a few moments.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.129
I don't think he likes the Nubbins.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.877
- But you can't say for sure?
- No, not yet.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.038
But I can say that I've never seen

13:36.148 --> 13:38.309
brain structures
quite like your grandfather's.

13:41.420 --> 13:45.254
Sophie, the blood I took from you
as a control sample, I should tell you,

13:45.357 --> 13:48.588
I found similar biochemical
anomalies to your grandfather's.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.623
Oh, my god.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.095
It would be premature
to read anything into it.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.224
Yeah, but if he was an abnormal-

13:55.334 --> 13:58.497
In 24 hours,
all this will be much clearer.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.936
Okay, well, look, since I've gotten
here, no one has told me squat

14:02.041 --> 14:03.975
about what this place actually does,

14:04.076 --> 14:06.408
and now you're telling me I'm
some kind of freak of nature, too?

14:06.579 --> 14:11.175
You guys are hiding something
from me, both of you!

14:12.418 --> 14:15.046
Why should I believe
a single thing you tell me?

14:19.291 --> 14:21.953
Sophie, we find ourselves
in a very rare situation.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.426
I'm about to do something that
I normally wouldn't even consider.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.792
I don't understand.
What?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.361
You will shortly.

14:33.906 --> 14:37.034
Will, would you be so kind
as to show our guest around?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.512
Uh...

14:41.847 --> 14:43.906
Yeah, sure.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.708
Watch yourself there, big guy.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.583
You don't want to get between
them and their breakfast.

14:49.755 --> 14:50.744
You could lose a hairy digit.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.692
I've never seen an animal
with such a...

14:57.796 --> 14:59.229
...big appetite.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.299
It's not just food.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.766
They're not pairing up
for square-dancing.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.968
Oh, man.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.741
Maybe you shouldn't be
exposing yourself unnecessarily.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.935
Yeah, the allergy pills
aren't working.

15:12.044 --> 15:15.241
I just hope these little dudes
aren't permanent guests.

15:19.451 --> 15:23.012
You look as queasy as I did
when I first walked this floor.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.095
Actually, you're taking it
better than I did.

15:35.334 --> 15:38.929
I sensed all of this
before I got here.

15:39.038 --> 15:42.235
I mean, not the specifics, but...

15:42.508 --> 15:44.908
Even though
your granddad was gone.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.436
Maybe...

15:48.414 --> 15:50.644
...he passed on his gift.

15:51.984 --> 15:55.249
Or maybe the feelings that you
always saw as coming from him

15:55.354 --> 15:57.584
were coming from you.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.093
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...
You okay?

16:02.194 --> 16:06.460
Yeah, just lightheaded is all.
I tend to get these dizzy spells.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.432
- Why don't you sit down?
- I'm alright.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.071
You might be having
a mild panic attack or something.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.037
I just get like this.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.374
Well, we'll be sure to have
Dr. Magnus check it out.

16:22.681 --> 16:24.410
What is it?

16:24.717 --> 16:27.049
The new creatures...

16:27.786 --> 16:29.686
They're upset.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.233
I know it may be hard to believe,
but those aren't tricks of the eye.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.870
Those are flesh
and blood creatures.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.734
Of course they are.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.474
It's okay.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.316
Wow...

17:05.156 --> 17:06.419
They seem to be drawn to you.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.125
Whoa.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.492
You okay? Is it coming back?

17:12.598 --> 17:15.657
I think I should lie down for a while.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.396
Okay.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.842
Uh, come in.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.815
- Hey...
- Hey.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.753
The Nubbins came out
of camo mode,

17:38.857 --> 17:40.051
and we did a head count,

17:40.225 --> 17:41.385
and one of them was missing.

17:42.594 --> 17:45.324
Yeah, I just couldn't stop myself.

17:50.469 --> 17:51.595
What time is it?

17:53.038 --> 17:57.441
- Uh, it's almost 2:00.
- Weird.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.974
I must have fallen asleep
or something.

18:02.781 --> 18:03.577
Whoa.

18:03.749 --> 18:09.278
Hey! That is not very nice.
Will is a friend. Co-worker...

18:09.655 --> 18:11.885
Slash... Friend. That's all.

18:11.990 --> 18:15.050
Maybe you should, uh...
Maybe you should put him back,

18:15.227 --> 18:18.594
- just to be on the safe side.
- Okay, little buddy, let's go.

18:19.398 --> 18:23.664
- Oh! Oh, man!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:24.002 --> 18:25.731
Get back in here...

18:25.904 --> 18:28.839
- Aw...
- Oh, let me, uh.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.167
Let me get that for you.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.173
Uh...

18:39.384 --> 18:42.911
This, uh... Here.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.891
Just... Toss it in here.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.151
Let me, um...

18:52.965 --> 18:54.728
Uh, do that.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.341
Uh, y-you wouldn't have a...

19:03.442 --> 19:05.307
A man's shirt lying around,
would you?

19:05.744 --> 19:07.143
Medium, right?

19:07.779 --> 19:09.974
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.675
Yeah.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.218
Can I ask you something?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.689
Sure.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.555
Have you been feeling, um...

19:23.896 --> 19:27.559
- I don't know, uh, odd?
- How do you mean?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.024
Well, I'm not sure,

19:29.134 --> 19:30.897
but ever since we got back
from the ship, I've felt, uh...

19:31.069 --> 19:33.537
- Woozy?
- Is that how you're feeling?

19:33.639 --> 19:37.336
Uh... Yeah, kinda.

19:37.976 --> 19:42.345
I think sometimes I can...
Be a little stand-offish.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.309
I mean, I know I can be snippy.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.147
No. No, not at all.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.012
I don't want you to think
that I'm, um...

19:51.823 --> 19:55.759
unappreciative,
or unapproachable.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.391
I've been accused
of that by guys.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.762
Yeah, me too.

20:02.834 --> 20:07.294
Not by guys, but...
you know what I mean.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.204
Are you okay?

20:12.311 --> 20:15.838
Yeah, it's just these new contacts.
I'm just getting used to them.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.076
I really like you.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.715
- Really?
- Without glasses.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.047
Yeah?

20:24.323 --> 20:26.416
- Will?
- Yeah?

20:31.263 --> 20:32.753
Where's my Nubbin?

20:42.507 --> 20:45.533
Uh... Oh no.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.153
At first I thought they
were just camouflaging,

21:03.262 --> 21:05.958
but I swept the entire cell
feeling for them.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.294
Don't tell me
they've escaped?

21:11.203 --> 21:17.574
Something gnawed through
the ventilation grate from the outside.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.005
Mayday.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.813
I'm going to err
on the side of caution.

21:24.916 --> 21:25.905
I want the building sealed.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.315
Nobody goes in or out.

21:27.419 --> 21:30.081
Threat level "holy crap. " Check.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.152
These creatures
escape the Sanctuary,

21:32.257 --> 21:34.919
and we'll have much more than a
pest control problem on our hands.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.791
Can we not turn this
into a planetary crisis just yet?

21:37.896 --> 21:40.626
- They're 14 little furballs.
- Invisible furballs.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.290
We'll round them up, okay?

21:42.401 --> 21:45.666
If they reach sexual maturity
as fast as they've reached full size...

21:45.837 --> 21:46.929
Well, do the math.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.337
But they haven't overrun
their native habitat, right?

21:49.441 --> 21:51.773
Camouflaged or not,
they wouldn't be much of a secret,

21:51.877 --> 21:53.367
and that's the one saving grace.

21:53.545 --> 21:54.944
Something must
control their numbers.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.742
What about the predator
Eric brought back?

21:56.848 --> 21:58.941
That's one of a number
of theories I'm working on.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.575
Though their shared trait
of camouflage

22:00.686 --> 22:03.086
doesn't necessarily define
their relationship on the food chain.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.450
Well, we could
try to draw them out,

22:04.556 --> 22:06.217
if we could just figure out
what they crave.

22:06.725 --> 22:08.920
You know,
besides other Nubbins.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.824
Well, we know they're
hungry little suckers.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.295
I'll make sure our food stores
are protected.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.332
Too late for that.

22:15.434 --> 22:19.427
They've already wiped out
the pantry and the walk-in.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.870
What, there's nothing left?

22:26.445 --> 22:29.073
Right, we go floor by floor.

22:29.247 --> 22:32.410
Snares, tranquilizer,
whatever it takes.

22:37.155 --> 22:38.019
Ow.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.658
Okay.

23:15.827 --> 23:22.357
Hey, little guy, it's okay.
Here you go. That's gouda.

23:22.467 --> 23:25.698
Yeah, nobody's
going to hurt you, little fella.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.499
Nobody's gonna...

23:32.711 --> 23:35.009
I lied! I'm going to hurt you!

23:35.180 --> 23:37.011
Oh... Ow...

23:39.651 --> 23:42.415
Your mother was a sewer rat!

23:44.489 --> 23:47.219
I'm going to schedule
a full rabies series,

23:47.325 --> 23:50.351
unless we can confirm its absence
in every Nubbin out there.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.362
Isn't that, like, super painful?

23:54.466 --> 23:57.026
- I'm not going to lie to you, Henry.
- No, it's okay, please.

23:57.202 --> 23:57.998
Lie to me.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.230
Those poor things
must've been pushed to the limits.

24:00.338 --> 24:03.899
Hey, listen, I know you're all about
saving the whales and everything,

24:04.009 --> 24:06.534
but these guys just happen to be
a pack of vicious, over-sexed,

24:06.645 --> 24:08.203
hyperthyroid, invisi-rodents.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.281
Stop demonising them.
They were just afraid!

24:11.383 --> 24:13.851
Ashley, we have no history
with this species.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.443
We cannot take
this attack lightly.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.553
Now, how many have we
re-captured so far?

24:20.325 --> 24:23.556
- Three, or so.
- Three?

24:23.662 --> 24:26.358
- Almost four.
- Out of 14?

24:26.465 --> 24:30.424
Actually,
I'd go up about five... times.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.071
What did you see?

24:34.172 --> 24:36.436
I'm not sure "see" is the right word,
but by the way they rippled,

24:36.541 --> 24:39.533
I'd say we're looking
at several litters of newborns,

24:39.644 --> 24:43.273
but, hey, they won't be doing
the horizontal tango for, like, hours.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.576
We need to corral them all
as quickly as possible.

24:45.684 --> 24:47.618
Henry, I'm taking you
off the front lines.

24:47.719 --> 24:50.517
I want you working
on a more technological solution.

24:50.622 --> 24:51.611
I'm good with that.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.418
Tell me you're not talking
about exterminating them.

24:53.592 --> 24:54.581
I'd like nothing more

24:54.693 --> 24:56.661
than to see them all safely
back in their cell unharmed.

24:56.761 --> 24:58.160
- Yeah, but-
- We wouldn't even be having

24:58.330 --> 25:00.628
this discussion
had you shown better judgment.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.161
Come in.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.533
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:16.381 --> 25:19.145
- Could you give us a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.377
Thank you.

25:23.054 --> 25:24.214
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.018
Dr. Magnus...

25:27.192 --> 25:28.284
Hello, Sophie.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.690
Will said you might be able
to help me.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.020
Please, have a seat.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.400
He told you about the headaches,
and the spins and all that?

25:40.705 --> 25:44.539
If it's alright with you, I'd like
to conduct a few simple tests.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.576
Simple, like brain scans?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.848
Probably prudent
under the circumstances.

25:52.517 --> 25:54.508
I know you have more
important things to deal with.

25:54.619 --> 25:55.745
You're in the middle of a crisis.

25:56.087 --> 25:59.648
Actually, by Sanctuary standards,
this is just another day at the office.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.486
What did my grandfather die of?

26:07.599 --> 26:09.032
A brain aneurysm.

26:10.402 --> 26:15.101
Oh. And you said that we have
similar anomalies.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.533
Let's just see what's happens
before we anticipate, alright?

26:20.946 --> 26:22.573
Okay.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.874
It's going to be okay, Sophie.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.420
Okay, here's my idea.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.051
We capture a male Nubbin,
use it as bait

26:37.162 --> 26:39.722
and wait for the females to swarm.

26:39.898 --> 26:43.356
Or we use a female as bait
and watch the males swarm.

26:43.468 --> 26:44.992
Well, want as many
of the child-bearers

26:45.103 --> 26:46.661
back in captivity as possible.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.137
As if the girls
are going to go all weak-kneed

26:49.240 --> 26:50.571
over the right Nubbin.

26:51.142 --> 26:52.837
I'm sorry, the "right Nubbin"?

26:52.944 --> 26:58.075
You know, smart, handsome,
good sense of humor, go-getter,

26:58.183 --> 27:00.242
dedicated to the same things
you are,

27:00.352 --> 27:02.980
loves long walks on the beach...

27:03.955 --> 27:05.650
Are you okay?

27:06.524 --> 27:09.357
Yeah. Yeah, I-I'm fine.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.623
Johnny nub in the crosshairs.

27:19.838 --> 27:23.274
There's nothing that threatens
your health. You're fine, Sophie.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.341
But you did find something.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.138
It's completely benign,

27:27.312 --> 27:29.439
similar to what we found
in your grandfather's brain,

27:29.547 --> 27:32.141
a tissue structure that bridges
your frontal lobes.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.514
- Like a tumor!
- No, no, nothing like that.

27:34.686 --> 27:38.486
There's a nerve bundle that links
this unusual organ to the thalamus.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.258
I think it may be used
in pre-verbal communication.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.657
Oh, this is unbelievable.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.194
I suspect it's some sort
of empathic ability.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.024
In my world,
it's a genetic expression

27:49.134 --> 27:51.659
that may well preview
an evolutionary advance.

27:52.103 --> 27:54.663
I just always
attributed it to Maurice.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.434
It only ever happened
when I was with him.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.667
He wanted to bring out
your gifts, no doubt.

27:58.777 --> 27:59.937
That's what the will was about.

28:00.045 --> 28:03.879
This condition that I have,
assuming that you're right, what...

28:04.649 --> 28:06.116
What does that mean I can do?

28:06.451 --> 28:09.716
Well, that's for you to explore.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.721
With our help, if you'll trust us.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.729
Ha!

28:29.841 --> 28:32.105
Maybe this isn't going to be
as tough as we thought.

28:33.578 --> 28:35.068
Huh...

28:36.147 --> 28:38.308
I'm not so sure about that.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.725
Well, I'm telling you, we have
a Nubbins explosion on our hands.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.519
I think I've found something
that may well explain

28:52.630 --> 28:54.097
their popularity
as a wedding gift.

28:54.199 --> 28:56.292
Wait, don't tell me.
They can be returned?

28:57.469 --> 29:00.961
Actually, they have scent glands
that emit powerful pheromones.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.266
Huh.

29:02.373 --> 29:04.398
Well, that explains their
overactive mating instinct.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.272
In fact, it may well extend
beyond their own species.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.978
You're not saying
that they're affecting us?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.512
Haven't you noticed it?

29:15.153 --> 29:18.850
Are you asking me
if I've been feeling... randy?

29:19.657 --> 29:20.851
I've made you uncomfortable.

29:20.959 --> 29:26.090
No, as a matter of fact, you've, uh...
You've aroused my curiosity.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.799
Oh. Well...

29:28.900 --> 29:30.197
Turnabout is fair play.

29:34.506 --> 29:35.473
Awkward.

29:36.307 --> 29:37.501
Poor thing.

29:38.743 --> 29:42.509
- What the hey?
- What's going on?

29:42.714 --> 29:43.874
We've got problems.

29:43.982 --> 29:45.779
You mean beyond the fact
these things are spilling out

29:45.884 --> 29:47.977
like popcorn at a matinee?

29:48.153 --> 29:51.816
Our systems are degrading.
We got surges, reboots...

29:51.923 --> 29:53.481
Must be the step-down
transformer.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.490
Whoa!

29:55.593 --> 29:58.118
Well, clearly that wasn't good.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.728
Alright, is it me, or does it smell
like fried Nubbin?

30:02.167 --> 30:05.796
Dude, I haven't been able to smell
anything since they got here.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.538
Oh, man...

30:16.214 --> 30:19.706
We have Nubbins in four out
of five infrastructure systems-

30:19.884 --> 30:22.785
Computer, cooling,
electrical, air purification.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.582
They're not in the water. Yet.

30:24.689 --> 30:27.180
I don't think it was an accident they
brought down the computer system.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.385
Come on, they're smart,
but they're not that smart.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.688
I don't know.

30:30.795 --> 30:33.491
A couple get sacrificed
to bring down the entire server?

30:33.598 --> 30:34.462
Air vents clogged?

30:34.632 --> 30:36.691
Drones sent out to protect
the survival of the hive.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.994
- Yeah.
These aren't bees.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.535
They just reproduce as fast.

30:40.638 --> 30:43.573
Hive mentality means tradeoffs
between individual survival

30:43.675 --> 30:44.642
and that of the group.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.505
We've seen it
in orders higher than insects.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.646
Yeah, like every time
soldiers go into battle.

30:48.813 --> 30:50.405
So, what does that tell us
about what they'll do?

30:50.515 --> 30:53.484
Everything they can to ensure
inter-species domination.

30:53.651 --> 30:56.484
You know, this catching them one
at a time is not working.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.214
The more I watch our predator,
the more I'm beginning to think

30:59.324 --> 31:01.849
that it is what controls the Nubbins
in their native habitat.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.823
You're not talking about
turning that killer loose?

31:03.928 --> 31:05.156
Not loose, Ashley.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.197
We can implant it with a device
so we could track it and control it.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.493
The vast majority of the Nubbins
would be stampeded into the open,

31:11.603 --> 31:13.161
and we could herd them to safety.

31:13.338 --> 31:14.327
It's just not fair.

31:14.439 --> 31:17.408
I mean, Nubbins are only doing
what their instincts tell them.

31:17.575 --> 31:18.564
All we'd be doing is replicating

31:18.676 --> 31:20.735
the predator-prey dynamic
that already exists.

31:20.912 --> 31:23.005
Of course. Yeah, like
the lions and the Christians.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.274
We have them contained
right now, but if they get out

31:25.450 --> 31:27.213
and this expands
beyond the Sanctuary,

31:27.385 --> 31:30.354
we could be ground Zero
for a plague of furry locusts.

31:30.455 --> 31:33.253
We have to act, and quickly.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.926
Tracking device is active.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.039
It's alright, Henry.
He's quite sedated.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.471
Mm-hmm.

31:51.943 --> 31:52.967
Would you rather I do it?

31:53.077 --> 31:55.409
No. It's- it's okay, I just...

31:55.513 --> 31:58.846
Much better with computer bytes
than animal bites.

32:02.186 --> 32:04.746
- There.
- Huh? Huh? See?

32:04.856 --> 32:06.824
What did I tell you? Easy peasy.

32:16.801 --> 32:17.665
Sophie?

32:20.405 --> 32:21.133
Hey...

32:21.906 --> 32:23.840
Just wanted to see
how you were feeling.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.876
Did Dr. Magnus tell you?

32:25.977 --> 32:28.207
I... Told her it was okay
if she did.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.838
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.316
She, uh...

32:33.418 --> 32:35.978
Gave me this bio-feedback device
to use

32:36.154 --> 32:41.182
so I know when these supposed
powers are working, and...

32:43.161 --> 32:45.459
I guess you're pretty used
to dealing with freaks, huh?

32:47.999 --> 32:50.263
That's not how I see you.

32:50.568 --> 32:53.935
I guess I'm just feeling
sorry for myself.

32:55.206 --> 32:57.640
Well, I'm sorry
that you're stuck here

32:57.742 --> 32:59.835
in the middle
of a level-three bio-hazard.

33:09.287 --> 33:11.118
The beast...

33:12.857 --> 33:15.485
The one the Nubbins are afraid of.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.292
It's waking up.

33:18.229 --> 33:19.958
How did you know that?

33:20.064 --> 33:22.897
I don't know, I just...

33:25.403 --> 33:26.870
I- Uh, I don't know.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.639
Listen, Sophie...

33:30.742 --> 33:35.076
These feelings that you're having,
the connections with the creatures,

33:35.346 --> 33:37.075
you should trust them.

33:37.181 --> 33:40.082
It's a...
It's a very special thing.

33:40.251 --> 33:45.712
Well, I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
I don't feel special. I...

33:46.624 --> 33:49.821
I feel like I should be
in a sideshow.

33:50.461 --> 33:51.985
This sense,

33:52.096 --> 33:55.429
it doesn't happen to tell you
where the Nubbins are, does it?

33:55.533 --> 33:56.898
No.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.933
But...

33:59.937 --> 34:03.270
I can... feel their hearts racing.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.271
Their fear...

34:07.645 --> 34:09.010
Their desire.

34:29.634 --> 34:32.398
Nature abhors a vacuum.

34:32.503 --> 34:35.130
That's because she's never
seen mine.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.735
Okay...

34:37.842 --> 34:39.639
Easy there, little Nubbin...

34:44.282 --> 34:46.341
A- ha!

34:53.458 --> 34:57.121
I've got suction,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.500
Releasing the predator...

35:13.177 --> 35:14.940
Wow. Look at him go.

35:15.213 --> 35:17.681
Team one, predator
moving from utility five,

35:17.782 --> 35:20.307
herding Nubbins
toward residential corridor.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.544
- Shut down air vents.
Copy that.

35:42.106 --> 35:43.733
Predator three, Nubbins Zero.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.239
Hey, where's he gone?

35:48.012 --> 35:49.707
I'm not seeing him.

35:49.814 --> 35:50.838
Track the device.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.086
Level five, north corridor.
He's moving fast!

35:56.187 --> 35:59.714
Checking level five, north corridor,
primary and secondary cameras.

36:00.057 --> 36:02.821
Nothing on the primary corridor.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.825
- Negative on "B" and "C".
- Whoa.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.391
Nubbins on the move.

36:10.034 --> 36:13.060
Oh, wait a second.
Predator's stopped.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.795
- A dead stop.
- Where?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.066
Just outside the library.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.006
We're losing power
on the main grid.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.578
Go to auxiliary.

36:29.754 --> 36:31.187
And we have lost auxiliary.

36:31.789 --> 36:35.020
Okay, women and geeks first.
Oh, no, wait, that's all of us.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.788
See what you can do, Henry.
Will, let's go.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.557
Okay.

37:46.030 --> 37:49.261
They're tranquilizer rounds.
One shot won't do it.

38:09.053 --> 38:11.647
Looks like our predator
just became prey.

38:11.822 --> 38:14.416
Why do I have the feeling
that we're next?

38:16.227 --> 38:19.458
Well, I guess we can
skip the midnight feeding.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.766
So we were wrong
about our predator

38:26.871 --> 38:29.203
keeping the Nubbins in check
in the rainforest?

38:29.307 --> 38:31.241
Well, not necessarily.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.309
I mean, sometimes
predator becomes prey.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.078
Hyenas, for example,
have been known to kill lions.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.772
Apparently we underestimated
the Nubbins' strength in numbers.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.215
Can you imagine what ten times
the number of Nubbins will do?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.343
Or a hundred times?

38:42.453 --> 38:43.351
If they can rip a creature

38:43.454 --> 38:45.251
the size and strength
of the predator to shreds,

38:45.356 --> 38:46.880
I have no doubt
they'd give us no quarter.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.715
We may have just sealed ourselves
in with our executioners.

38:50.027 --> 38:53.656
Their hive behavior
isn't just intelligent, it's strategic.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.996
Sooner or later,
they're going to find a way out.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.034
And they're reproducing faster than
we can capture or eradicate them.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.437
Doesn't anybody have
some good news?

39:01.539 --> 39:02.733
I've got wood.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.573
You know- For the fire.

39:13.584 --> 39:15.017
Hey...

39:15.119 --> 39:17.451
When we were aboard the Lophelia,
do you remember the hold

39:17.621 --> 39:19.612
- where we found the Nubbins?
- The refrigerated dry hold.

39:19.724 --> 39:20.656
Yeah.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.192
Although it was either
turned off or malfunctioning.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.388
Cryogenic transport is fairly common
for a bioresearch vessel.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.723
Yeah, but the thing is, is...

39:31.502 --> 39:33.732
The setting on the control panel...

39:35.606 --> 39:39.201
It was for 50 degrees, which is cold,
but well above freezing.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.771
So maybe it was their intention
to slow their metabolism,

39:43.280 --> 39:45.214
moderate their growth
and mating cycles.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.944
Ashley, you and Henry round up as
many fire extinguishers as you can.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.246
On it.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.282
Still, even if we
are right about the cold,

39:54.392 --> 39:55.859
unless we can drive them
into the open,

39:55.960 --> 39:58.827
I don't see how that by itself
will do the trick.

40:00.664 --> 40:02.757
You are right about the cold, Will.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.002
They don't like it.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.094
Can you tell what
they're feeling now?

40:11.442 --> 40:13.205
Crowded...

40:14.011 --> 40:15.444
Afraid...

40:15.546 --> 40:17.343
Threatened...

40:17.848 --> 40:19.110
They're sending warnings.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.482
They're sounding an alarm?

40:25.256 --> 40:26.553
What are you thinking?

40:26.657 --> 40:28.989
That we try and mimic the frequency
of their distress call.

40:30.127 --> 40:32.595
If we're successful, we could
strategically place emitters

40:32.763 --> 40:34.230
powerful enough to flush them out,

40:34.331 --> 40:36.492
stampede them,
and funnel them towards capture.

40:38.335 --> 40:39.597
What are you getting, Henry?

40:39.703 --> 40:41.898
Just over 19 kilohertz.

40:42.006 --> 40:44.600
Ultrasonic. Beyond the range
of human hearing.

40:44.708 --> 40:46.266
19.5...

40:47.278 --> 40:48.939
20...

40:49.046 --> 40:53.039
21.5... And stabilizing.

40:53.150 --> 40:56.313
There's your distress call,
21.5 kilohertz.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.116
Time to chill, guys.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.469
So what'll happen
to the Nubbins now?

42:25.643 --> 42:28.407
Now that low temperature has slowed
their reproductive cycle to a crawl,

42:28.512 --> 42:30.446
they can live out their days
in relative peace.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.140
They're not too thrilled
about the cold.

42:32.249 --> 42:35.446
Hey, thrilled Nubbins
is what got us into this mess.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.748
It was very brave of you
to share your gift.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.949
Well, in the end, Henry's allergies
were a better detector

42:41.058 --> 42:43.720
than any of my paranormal
abilities.

42:43.894 --> 42:47.261
The difference is, is that you can
sense a lot more than Nubbins.

42:47.431 --> 42:50.298
Yeah. I'm still not sure
how I feel about that.

42:51.435 --> 42:53.835
I think we know what
your grandfather wanted for you.

42:55.005 --> 42:58.668
Yeah. I guess, in a way,
he'll always be guiding me.

42:59.610 --> 43:01.601
And so will we.
