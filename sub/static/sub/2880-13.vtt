<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

00:03.030 --> 00:04.979
This is just a minor setback.

00:05.030 --> 00:06.146
No, it's not, okay?

00:06.148 --> 00:07.714
I've been out here
for, like, ten years.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.283
I have nothing to show for it.

00:09.285 --> 00:11.201
Well, you have me.

00:12.036 --> 00:14.404
I do have you.

00:14.406 --> 00:15.656
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:15.658 --> 00:17.875
(sighs)

00:19.527 --> 00:22.112
Leonard Hofstadter,

00:22.114 --> 00:24.715
will you marry me?

00:29.003 --> 00:32.389
Did you seriously
just say, "Um..."?

00:33.675 --> 00:35.342
It's an outrage.
I know.

00:35.344 --> 00:37.895
The university-- they think
they can do whatever they want.

00:37.897 --> 00:40.147
We just have to sit
there and take it.

00:40.149 --> 00:41.849
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

00:41.851 --> 00:44.601
You work tirelessly for someone,
and this is what you get.

00:44.603 --> 00:45.853
Oh, my God!

00:45.855 --> 00:48.355
They're just making you
use your vacation days!

00:48.357 --> 00:50.357
But I don't want
a vacation.

00:50.359 --> 00:53.093
Okay, listen,
I don't mean to diminish

00:53.095 --> 00:54.828
what you're going through,

00:54.830 --> 00:56.530
but I'm a little
distracted right now.

00:56.532 --> 00:58.315
Oh, this again? So,

00:58.317 --> 00:59.833
Penny proposed,
you didn't say yes,

00:59.835 --> 01:02.452
and now you think you may have
lost her love forever.

01:02.454 --> 01:04.486
How does this compare
to me being forced

01:04.489 --> 01:06.540
to relax for a few days?

01:08.459 --> 01:10.677
It doesn't!
Thank you!

01:12.764 --> 01:14.348
I'm gonna go
talk to Penny.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.217
I'm going to go inside,
put on my coziest pajamas,

01:17.219 --> 01:18.752
curl up with a good book

01:18.754 --> 01:21.805
and wait for this nightmare
to be over.

01:21.807 --> 01:23.974
(sighs)

01:25.310 --> 01:28.111
Penny.

01:32.033 --> 01:34.234
Sorry.

01:35.119 --> 01:37.512
Hi.
Hey.

01:37.513 --> 01:39.563
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't text you back.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.490
I just needed
some time to think.

01:40.492 --> 01:42.543
Okay.
Here. Come in.

01:42.545 --> 01:44.411
Look, if you want
to break up, just say it.

01:44.413 --> 01:46.213
Leonard...
No, no, no, no. I take it back.

01:46.215 --> 01:48.582
Don't say it. Just-just hate me,
but stay with me.

01:48.584 --> 01:50.133
It worked for my parents.

01:51.803 --> 01:54.788
Listen, I don't want
to break up with you.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.840
Oh. O-Okay.

01:56.842 --> 01:58.342
Good, good.

01:58.344 --> 01:59.359
(laughs)

01:59.361 --> 02:01.595
So, it's cool if I cry a little?

02:02.480 --> 02:04.481
Yeah, I probably wouldn't.

02:04.483 --> 02:07.034
Yeah.

02:07.036 --> 02:08.134
(clearing throat)

02:08.137 --> 02:10.270
Look, you did the
right thing last night.

02:10.271 --> 02:11.672
I was a mess.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.424
I was just frustrated because
my career is going nowhere.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.559
Look, I get it,
and I want you to know

02:16.561 --> 02:18.695
that I support whatever
you want to do.

02:18.697 --> 02:19.997
Great, because
I've been thinking,

02:19.999 --> 02:21.949
if I really want this
acting thing to work,

02:21.951 --> 02:23.850
I need to focus all
my energy on it.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.152
And to do that,

02:25.154 --> 02:26.620
I should quit waitressing

02:26.622 --> 02:28.238
at The Cheesecake Factory.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.957
Wow!

02:29.959 --> 02:31.625
That-That's a big step.

02:31.627 --> 02:33.327
I know.
So, you know,

02:33.329 --> 02:34.511
before making any rash...

02:34.513 --> 02:36.697
I already quit.
And I support you!

to work with you.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.689
No. You're on vacation.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.225
Please. What if there's a big
breakthrough in science today

03:14.227 --> 03:15.927
and I'm not
there to see it?

03:15.929 --> 03:17.462
Do you really think
there's gonna be a breakthrough

03:17.464 --> 03:18.663
without you there to do it?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.815
No. I was just tricking you.

03:20.817 --> 03:23.684
Bye.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.437
Leonard, wait!

03:26.439 --> 03:28.088
Take me with you.

03:28.090 --> 03:29.724
No!

03:29.726 --> 03:31.091
Please.
No!

03:31.093 --> 03:32.426
Too bad. I'm coming with you.

03:32.428 --> 03:33.945
Oh, Sheldon, stay!
But...

03:33.947 --> 03:36.114
I said stay!

03:41.954 --> 03:43.955
I'm going to work.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.157
Do not follow me.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.677
BERNADETTE: Hey, Stuart.
(gasps)

04:07.696 --> 04:10.314
Hey.
Sorry. Did I startle you?

04:10.316 --> 04:13.851
Yes, but at this point,
pretty much any customer does.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.553
What can I do for you?

04:15.555 --> 04:17.303
Well, I need a little help.

04:17.305 --> 04:18.805
I accidentally destroyed
one of Howard's

04:18.808 --> 04:19.991
comic books this morning,

04:19.993 --> 04:21.475
and was hoping
I could replace it.

04:21.476 --> 04:22.894
Wow. What happened?

04:22.896 --> 04:26.447
Batman got his ass kicked
by my curling iron.

04:26.449 --> 04:30.017
Well, don't let
The Riddler know that.

04:30.686 --> 04:33.855
It's a comic book joke.

04:34.523 --> 04:36.757
Or maybe it's not.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.010
Do you have this one?

04:39.012 --> 04:40.795
Uh, well, it's-it's
pretty rare.

04:40.797 --> 04:43.047
Can you give me a few
days to track it down?

04:43.049 --> 04:44.966
Ooh, I was kind of
hoping to get it

04:44.968 --> 04:47.268
before Howie comes home from work.
Oh. What's the hurry?

04:47.270 --> 04:48.553
Well, he's always saying

04:48.555 --> 04:50.438
I should be more careful
with my curling iron,

04:50.440 --> 04:51.889
and it seems like
a dangerous precedent

04:51.891 --> 04:54.058
to let him think
he can be right.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.394
Well, I'll do what I can,

04:56.396 --> 04:58.546
but I can't make
any promises.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.400
You know, I do work
at a pharmaceutical company.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.619
If you can make this
happen today,

05:04.621 --> 05:07.872
I can hook you up with anxiety
medication, antidepressants.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.707
Really?

05:11.326 --> 05:13.711
Do you have
any of these?

05:17.966 --> 05:20.534
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

05:21.553 --> 05:24.005
Not so bitey
without the rest of the rat

05:24.007 --> 05:25.673
to back us up now, are we?

05:25.675 --> 05:26.908
(knocking)

05:26.910 --> 05:28.208
Anybody home?

05:28.210 --> 05:29.227
Hey, what brings
you guys here?

05:29.229 --> 05:30.328
Well, we were
just on our way

05:30.330 --> 05:31.345
to lunch and wanted to see

05:31.347 --> 05:32.430
if you'd like to join.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.564
Why?

05:33.566 --> 05:34.882
Because Sheldon's
not here this week,

05:34.884 --> 05:36.517
and you don't think
I have any other options?

05:36.519 --> 05:38.686
I'm just kidding.
I'll get my purse.

05:38.688 --> 05:41.239
Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.257
I'm soy. I didn't know
you had any company.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.358
That's okay.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.726
Uh, Bert,
this is Howard and Rajesh.

05:45.728 --> 05:46.978
Guys, this is Bert.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.162
Hey. Good to see you.
Hey.

05:48.164 --> 05:49.664
Anyway, I wanted to show you

05:49.666 --> 05:52.083
this tourmalinated quartz
that we got in the lab.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.868
This is so pretty.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.753
Bert works for the
geology department.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.838
Yeah. You know what,
uh, geologists

05:57.840 --> 05:59.590
and Bon Jovi have in common?

05:59.592 --> 06:01.909
You're both
into rock?

06:03.712 --> 06:06.113
Yeah.

06:07.599 --> 06:09.934
Well, see ya.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.102
Oh, you forgot your quartz.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.803
Oh, it's okay.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.639
I want you to have it.

06:15.607 --> 06:17.008
Bye.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.392
He's nice.

06:18.394 --> 06:21.846
Yeah, he's nice
because he likes you.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.398
What?! No, he doesn't.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.117
He brought you
a pretty rock.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.818
So? He does that every day...

06:27.820 --> 06:29.487
Oh.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.822
You know, if you'd
rather skip lunch

06:31.824 --> 06:34.525
and hang out with your boyfriend
Bert, it's totally okay.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.160
He's not my boyfriend.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.245
Are you sure? He's tall,
pale and awkward.

06:38.247 --> 06:40.331
That sounds like your type.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.734
Should someone as lonely as you
really be making fun of me?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.553
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.957
What do I do? I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.393
Maybe the problem is
he thinks you're available.

06:52.395 --> 06:54.095
Does he know
you're dating Sheldon?

06:54.097 --> 06:56.430
I guess it hasn't come up.

06:56.432 --> 06:58.482
There you go.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.152
And does Sheldon know
you're dating Sheldon?

07:03.021 --> 07:06.040
I'm sorry. Who are <i>you</i> dating?

07:06.042 --> 07:08.242
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

07:15.667 --> 07:17.668
(sighs)

07:17.670 --> 07:19.370
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.038
Hello.

07:26.595 --> 07:28.629
You okay?

07:28.631 --> 07:30.715
I'm on vacation.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.967
What do you think?

07:32.969 --> 07:35.502
Why are you sitting
in the stairwell?

07:36.504 --> 07:38.672
Leonard told me to stay.

07:39.758 --> 07:43.177
Oh. Well, good boy.

07:43.179 --> 07:45.345
Where are you going?

07:45.347 --> 07:46.697
Oh, I have a ton
of errands to run.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.015
I need to make copies
of my headshot,

07:48.017 --> 07:49.150
send them off to agents

07:49.152 --> 07:50.735
and sign up
for a new acting class and...

07:50.737 --> 07:52.536
Well, have fun.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.522
Okay.

07:54.524 --> 07:56.407
(whimpers)

07:59.077 --> 08:01.112
You want to come with me?

08:01.114 --> 08:03.530
Really?

08:03.532 --> 08:06.250
Come on, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.303
Get in the car. Come on.

08:10.505 --> 08:13.090
All right, thanks a lot.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.842
They have one at
Capital Comics.

08:14.844 --> 08:16.794
Oh, that's great.
No, it's not.

08:16.796 --> 08:18.378
I hate that place.

08:18.380 --> 08:20.431
Guy who owns it is a jerk.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.750
He's always making me
feel bad about myself.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.152
Oh, that's terrible.

08:25.154 --> 08:27.054
What's the address?

08:27.056 --> 08:29.056
You know, why don't
I just take you there?

08:29.058 --> 08:31.559
That way, I can make sure
he doesn't rip you off.

08:31.561 --> 08:33.244
Oh, thanks, but I don't
want you to close up.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.578
I mean, won't you lose business?

08:37.432 --> 08:39.750
Sorry. That was mean.

08:43.705 --> 08:45.773
Penny really quit
The Cheesecake Factory?

08:45.798 --> 08:46.258
Yeah.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.575
So, what is she doing today?
I don't know.

08:48.577 --> 08:50.044
She already thinks
I don't support this,

08:50.046 --> 08:52.680
so if I call, it might look like
I'm checking up on her.

08:52.682 --> 08:53.831
Well, do you support this?

08:53.833 --> 08:55.299
Of course I do.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.550
She's a great actress.

08:56.552 --> 08:58.252
I'm proud she's
taking this risk.

08:58.254 --> 08:59.770
That's nice.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.939
You bought that? Great!

09:04.576 --> 09:07.895
I got to call her before
I forget how I said it.

09:07.897 --> 09:09.847
Hey.

09:09.849 --> 09:10.865
Hi. What's up?

09:10.867 --> 09:11.849
Oh, how's it going?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.234
You taking Hollywood by storm?

09:13.236 --> 09:15.102
Actually,
I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

09:15.104 --> 09:17.288
You got your job back.
That is great news.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.073
I didn't want
to say anything,

09:19.075 --> 09:20.574
but you are making
the right choice.

09:20.576 --> 09:21.625
To plunge yourself into debt

09:21.627 --> 09:22.943
right now would be
literally insane.

09:22.945 --> 09:24.128
Yeah.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.831
I'm just returning my uniform.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.669
And I support you.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.964
MALE VOICE: Before we begin
your guided meditation,

09:42.966 --> 09:44.332
close your eyes

09:44.334 --> 09:47.135
and picture yourself
in a peaceful environment.

09:47.137 --> 09:49.404
Okay.

09:50.773 --> 09:54.609
I'm inside
the CERN super collider.

09:55.411 --> 09:57.545
Now, take a deep,
relaxing breath

09:57.547 --> 09:59.114
in through your nose.

09:59.116 --> 10:01.182
(inhales deeply through nose)

10:01.184 --> 10:03.134
And let it out.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.437
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

10:06.805 --> 10:08.273
In.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.308
(inhales deeply through nose)

10:10.310 --> 10:11.642
Let me guess.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.361
And out.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.612
(exhales loudly)

10:14.614 --> 10:17.332
What was I gonna do?
Two "ins" in a row?

10:17.334 --> 10:18.833
(car door opens)

10:21.470 --> 10:23.304
Where's my lemonade?

10:23.306 --> 10:24.873
I didn't get it.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.876
A fitting swan song
to your career as a waitress

10:27.878 --> 10:30.795
to forget my order
one last time.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.000
(sighs)

10:36.002 --> 10:39.354
Do you think quitting
my job was a mistake?

10:39.356 --> 10:42.474
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.727
No. I'm serious.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.312
Why do you ask?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.514
Because Leonard
just pissed me off.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.682
Am I being an idiot or not?

10:51.684 --> 10:54.152
No, I don't think you are.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.520
Really?

10:55.522 --> 10:58.456
The best way to achieve a goal
is to devote 100%

10:58.458 --> 11:00.458
of your time and energy to it.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.794
When I decided I was going
to be a physicist,

11:02.796 --> 11:04.195
I didn't take
some other job

11:04.197 --> 11:06.331
in case it didn't work out.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.533
Which wasn't easy because
there was a lot of pressure

11:08.535 --> 11:11.536
from Ms. Pierson for me
to be chalk monitor that year.

11:12.304 --> 11:15.507
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.708
Why can't Leonard understand it?

11:18.978 --> 11:21.262
Because he's not
like us, Penny.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.548
We're dreamers.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.268
Yeah, I need to start
cracking the window

11:27.270 --> 11:29.220
when I leave you in the car.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.512
Hey.

11:37.514 --> 11:38.830
Hello, Bert.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.782
So, anyway,
there's this big, uh,

11:40.784 --> 11:42.700
rock and mineral show next week

11:42.702 --> 11:44.402
in Santa Monica and...
Listen,

11:44.404 --> 11:47.805
um, Bert, before you say
anything else, I...

11:47.807 --> 11:49.824
I have a boyfriend.

11:49.826 --> 11:52.210
Oh. This is awkward.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.679
You thought I was gonna ask you
to go with me

11:54.681 --> 11:55.930
to the mineral show.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.448
Weren't you?

11:58.284 --> 12:01.553
Yeah.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.272
That's very nice
of you, but...

12:04.274 --> 12:06.574
I do have a boyfriend.

12:06.576 --> 12:07.809
That's what you all say.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.694
You just don't want
to go out with me

12:09.696 --> 12:11.279
because I have
an off-putting personality.

12:11.281 --> 12:13.114
No, that's not true.

12:13.116 --> 12:15.450
My boyfriend has
an off-putting personality, too.

12:15.452 --> 12:17.785
Like, way worse than you.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.538
(chuckles)
Don't worry.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.772
I'm used to it.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.993
I mean, I'm big and weird
and funny-looking

12:24.995 --> 12:27.879
and no one ever wants
to do anything with me.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.114
Don't say that.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.467
It's okay.

12:32.469 --> 12:34.235
I know I'm a monster.

12:34.237 --> 12:35.786
No, Bert, come on.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.790
I'd love to go
to the mineral show with you.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.291
Sweet.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.260
It's a date.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.930
No, it's not.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.432
Too late!

12:49.685 --> 12:53.438
♪

12:55.457 --> 12:57.659
Wow.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.496
Yeah. Haven't seen
this many people in my store

13:01.498 --> 13:05.516
since that Korean church bus
crashed through my front window.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.869
MAN:
Hey! Stuart!

13:07.871 --> 13:08.937
Jesse.

13:08.939 --> 13:10.672
Haven't seen
you in forever.

13:10.674 --> 13:12.173
Look how gray you've gotten.

13:12.175 --> 13:14.642
My hair's exactly
the same color as always.

13:14.644 --> 13:17.111
No, I was talking
about your skin.

13:17.113 --> 13:20.582
Look, uh, my friend here needs
a comic book...

13:20.584 --> 13:22.717
Ooh! And she went
into your store by mistake.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.303
Good thing there was no one
there to see you.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.273
What do you need?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.524
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.

13:29.526 --> 13:30.692
Right over here.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.630
Even you, Sweatpants?

13:35.632 --> 13:37.949
Free popcorn.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.918
Can I offer you
a coffee?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.287
Espresso? Latte?

13:42.289 --> 13:43.321
No, thanks.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.523
How about you, Stu?
Mocha? Scone?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.126
Directions
to the nearest soup kitchen?

13:48.128 --> 13:49.460
Hey.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.495
I'm just kidding.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.830
He knows
where the soup kitchen is.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.668
It's on Merton Avenue.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.722
I don't think I like the way
you're treating my friend.

14:00.724 --> 14:01.889
Sorry.

14:01.891 --> 14:03.625
You want the book or not?

14:03.627 --> 14:04.642
Not from you.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.761
Let's go, Stuart.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.549
You know something, Jesse?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.851
You may have
a successful business

14:13.853 --> 14:15.687
a-and the kind
of pink complexion

14:15.689 --> 14:18.039
that comes
with good nutrition...

14:19.008 --> 14:21.159
...but I have something
more important.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.393
What's that?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.579
Friendship.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.752
(quietly): Which I would trade
in a heartbeat for all of this.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.957
The mineral and rock show?

14:35.959 --> 14:39.927
That would be awful
even without Bert.

14:39.929 --> 14:41.879
So what am I supposed to do now?

14:41.881 --> 14:45.082
Prepare your uterus
for his gigantic offspring?

14:47.536 --> 14:49.053
This isn't funny.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.755
I'm gonna have
to tell him the truth:

14:50.757 --> 14:52.473
that even if I didn't have
a boyfriend,

14:52.475 --> 14:53.775
I wouldn't be interested in him.

14:53.777 --> 14:55.926
(groans) I've heard those words
so many times.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.446
From Linda Nosenchuck,
Tammy Rosenworcel...

14:58.448 --> 14:59.981
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

14:59.983 --> 15:02.033
...Marci Grossman,
Lisa Mazzarino...

15:02.035 --> 15:03.651
...Megan Pincus...
...Tammy Cho...

15:03.653 --> 15:05.186
Oh, who was that girl
from our Starbucks?

15:05.188 --> 15:07.572
Arlene Russel!
Yes! Arlene!

15:07.574 --> 15:13.211
She wrote "no way"
on both our cappuccinos.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.629
Poor Bert.
(chuckles)

15:14.631 --> 15:16.831
That guy's got a rough
afternoon ahead of him.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.916
Well, how would
you want a girl

15:18.918 --> 15:20.768
to tell you she
wasn't interested?

15:20.770 --> 15:23.638
I guess, uh, I'd like her
to sit me down,

15:23.640 --> 15:25.640
look me in the eye and say,

15:25.642 --> 15:28.760
"I was wrong. I love you."

15:28.762 --> 15:29.744
And then maybe

15:29.746 --> 15:32.397
she could touch me
in a special way.

15:32.399 --> 15:36.467
That's how you
reject a guy.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.902
Okay, I don't have time
for this.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.438
I'm just gonna go find him
and be brutally honest.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.789
No, don't.
He'll be so upset.

15:41.791 --> 15:43.641
He'll probably climb up
the Empire State Building

15:43.643 --> 15:46.110
and start swatting
at planes.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.216
You want us to
talk to him?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.234
Really?

15:53.236 --> 15:54.569
You would do that?

15:54.571 --> 15:56.087
Sure. We've both been
in his shoes.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.740
We'll let him down
with compassion and respect.

15:58.742 --> 16:00.525
(exhales)
Thank you.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.510
Let's go.
(chuckles)

16:03.662 --> 16:05.663
(quietly): So we tell him
she's a lesbian, right?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.616
(quietly): Of course we tell
him she's a lesbian.

16:15.657 --> 16:18.059
And hold three...

16:18.061 --> 16:20.561
two... one.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.096
Very good.

16:22.098 --> 16:26.317
Now let's try
Warrior II.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.303
And hold.

16:32.090 --> 16:35.192
I've read that there are great
yogis who have such mastery

16:35.194 --> 16:40.081
over their bodies they can draw
water in through their genitals.

16:47.723 --> 16:51.926
Yeah, well, I don't think we're
gonna get to do that today.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.228
Too bad.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.564
It seems like a good way
to drink a milk shake

16:56.566 --> 16:59.317
without getting
brain freeze.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.687
Oh, hey.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.238
And now we go
to Reverse Warrior.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.723
(grunts)

17:09.361 --> 17:11.579
How did she get you to do yoga?

17:11.580 --> 17:16.233
Well, to be honest,
I thought she said "Yoda."

17:18.420 --> 17:22.707
I'm helping him relax because,
unlike you, he supports me.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.175
Oh, how many times
do I have to say it?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.544
I support you.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.078
(sighs)
Sheldon, take a break.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.381
<i>Namaste.</i>

17:32.367 --> 17:35.052
Okay, if you support me,
what was with that phone call?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.471
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.390
But if you care so much
what I think,

17:39.392 --> 17:41.309
why didn't you ask me
before you did it?

17:41.311 --> 17:42.727
Oh, so now I need
your permission?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.679
Would you have asked me
before you quit your job?

17:44.681 --> 17:47.565
Yes. I thought we were
in the kind of relationship

17:47.567 --> 17:48.900
where we make
decisions together.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.035
If I'm wrong,
then maybe we need to talk

17:51.037 --> 17:53.154
about the kind of relationship
we're actually in.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.255
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

17:54.257 --> 17:56.908
I'm willing to if you guys are.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.427
Can we please
have some privacy?

17:59.429 --> 18:00.711
Y... No.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.830
I'm as much a part
of this relationship as you two,

18:02.832 --> 18:05.449
and I think it's high time we
put all our cards on the table.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.802
Yeah. For example,
where is this going?

18:07.804 --> 18:10.021
Are you two ever
getting married?

18:10.023 --> 18:12.256
And, if so,
where will we all live?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.308
Have you thought about that?

18:14.310 --> 18:16.377
No.
Penny?

18:16.379 --> 18:17.645
Okay, wait. What
are we doing?

18:17.647 --> 18:19.129
For some reason,

18:19.131 --> 18:22.149
we're planning a future where we
both live with Sheldon forever.

18:22.151 --> 18:24.151
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.

18:24.153 --> 18:26.454
Look, I know you think

18:26.456 --> 18:28.239
I'm being reckless,
and you might be right,

18:28.241 --> 18:29.907
but I need to take this shot.

18:29.909 --> 18:30.858
Yeah, no kidding.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.526
Despite what it says
on her résumé,

18:32.528 --> 18:34.144
she is no longer 22.

18:37.432 --> 18:40.468
I swear, I am on your side.

18:40.470 --> 18:42.152
You keep saying
you’re on my side,

18:42.154 --> 18:43.621
but you don't act like it.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.922
He does that to me, too.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.674
Why do we put up with it?

18:47.759 --> 18:50.845
Listen, I could never do
what you're doing, okay?

18:50.847 --> 18:52.413
I would be terrified.

18:52.415 --> 18:54.215
Well, it's scary for me, too.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.333
I'm fine with it.

18:57.986 --> 19:00.137
My point is, just because
I couldn't do it

19:00.139 --> 19:01.472
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.058
And I'm proud of you.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.726
(clicks tongue)

19:05.728 --> 19:08.029
Okay. Thank you.

19:09.131 --> 19:10.998
Well, to celebrate
this reconciliation,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.700
let's all share a milk shake.

19:12.702 --> 19:15.569
Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.

19:21.043 --> 19:22.026
You're back.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.294
Yes, I am!

19:23.296 --> 19:25.379
There's a few more things
I want to say to you.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.631
Stuart's store is just fine,

19:26.633 --> 19:28.249
and he's a much nicer person
than you are,

19:28.251 --> 19:29.717
and if you still have
that comic,

19:29.719 --> 19:32.336
I'd like to buy it right now!

19:32.338 --> 19:33.554
No problem.

19:33.556 --> 19:36.190
Oh, you want a latte
while you wait?

19:36.192 --> 19:38.009
No, I don't want a latte!

19:38.011 --> 19:40.945
I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone!

19:40.947 --> 19:43.080
