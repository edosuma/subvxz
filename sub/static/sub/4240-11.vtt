I, uh, want us to be honest
with each other no matter what.

I-It's not really even that big a deal.

37:38.048 --> 37:42.760
I mean, I didn't actually
do anything, but...

37:42.844 --> 37:45.429
the other night when
you were babysitting,

37:45.513 --> 37:48.349
I kinda went over to Rachel's house.

But nothing happened. I...just
was worked up about us fighting,

37:52.479 --> 37:55.689
and then she put on this
really weird Catwoman suit,

37:55.774 --> 38:00.736

have happened, but i-it didn't.

Sure.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.299
I owe you an apology.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.345
I-I did think the kids needed
to be a little more showbiz,

Oh, that's the new addition.

39:35.623 --> 39:39.001
Yeah, I want the kids to forget everything
I taught them about hairography because—

39:39.085 --> 39:42.046
We're starting from
scratch. Grab a stool.

39:42.130 --> 39:45.716
So we're a stool choir now? No.
We're not dancing with the stools.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.075
split them between your two groups,

40:11.159 --> 40:15.621
and I'll pull some strings and make sure
that Schuester and his group perform last.

40:15.705 --> 40:20.417
That way, it'll look like
he stole the songs from you.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.878
Um, who do you think I am?

That's actually a very good question,
because I've forgotten both ofyour names.

Look, I spend every waking hour of
my day trying to teach those girls...

40:30.678 --> 40:33.722
that lying and cheating is not the
way you're ever gonna get ahead.

40:33.807 --> 40:37.768

so that they can win a singing competition?
