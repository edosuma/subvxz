Claimed he was NCIS,
but no credentials.

02:05.881 --> 02:07.781
Said he was working
undercover.

02:07.783 --> 02:10.150
I had to take him
into custody.

02:10.151 --> 02:11.518
Is he one of yours?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.086
So they tell me.

You did the right
thing, Pete. Thanks.

02:15.557 --> 02:16.723
Mm-hmm.

02:18.460 --> 02:19.893
Pride.

02:19.895 --> 02:21.528
We met over MTAC.

02:21.530 --> 02:22.962
Nick Torres.

02:22.964 --> 02:25.365
You make quite a first
impression, Nick Torres.

02:25.367 --> 02:28.234
Less than two hours in my city,
and you get yourself arrested

02:28.236 --> 02:30.403
as a suspected murderer.

02:30.405 --> 02:33.139
That's got to be
some kind of record.

02:34.576 --> 02:35.975
I got an explanation.

02:35.977 --> 02:37.644
Yeah, you and
Special Agent McGee

02:37.646 --> 02:40.046
were sent to New Orleans
to recover stolen Intel, yes?

02:40.048 --> 02:42.015
Yes. It's called
the Playbook.

02:42.017 --> 02:43.316
It's a collection of scenarios

02:43.318 --> 02:44.918
for viable terrorist attacks
against the U.S.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.321
Stolen from Homeland Security.
I... That much I know.

02:48.323 --> 02:50.957
What I don't know is why
you ran an operation

02:50.959 --> 02:53.026
without checking
in first.

02:53.028 --> 02:55.395
Tracking down a former contact
of my undercover days.

02:55.397 --> 02:56.629
That would be the murder victim.

02:56.631 --> 02:59.065
Ferdinand Pisco.
Venezuelan operative.

02:59.067 --> 03:01.534
Uh, he's in town
to acquire the Playbook.

03:01.536 --> 03:03.570
Had to handle it, um...

03:03.572 --> 03:05.004
delicately.

03:05.006 --> 03:06.639
Ah.

03:06.641 --> 03:09.309
That word must have a
different meaning up in D.C.

03:09.311 --> 03:12.145
But down here, in
New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,

03:12.147 --> 03:14.948
NCIS likes to keep
a lower profile.

03:14.950 --> 03:17.484
Pride, I was supposed
to check in. That's on me.

03:17.486 --> 03:19.719
But all I did
was follow the guy.

03:20.755 --> 03:22.388
Someone else killed him.

03:22.390 --> 03:23.690
Probably to make sure

03:23.692 --> 03:25.558
Ferdinand didn't
get the Playbook.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.693
Probably.

03:26.695 --> 03:27.827
Mm-hmm.

03:27.829 --> 03:30.763
We have to find out who.

03:30.765 --> 03:33.066
And here's
a silly question-- um...

03:33.068 --> 03:35.735
you think you could take these,
uh, handcuffs off me now?

03:35.737 --> 03:37.837
Haven't decided yet.

03:37.839 --> 03:39.606
Pride, I'm telling you,

03:39.608 --> 03:42.275
my second impression is
so much better than the first.

03:42.277 --> 03:45.311
One can only hope.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.616
Loretta.

03:49.618 --> 03:50.850
Dwayne.

03:50.852 --> 03:53.786
This is not exactly
how I expected to spend

03:53.788 --> 03:55.221
the weekend before Mardi Gras.

03:55.223 --> 03:57.357
Imagine it wasn't
how Ferdinand Pisco

03:57.359 --> 03:59.392
expected it
would go either.

03:59.394 --> 04:01.961
I don't think he even realized
he was injured

04:01.963 --> 04:03.062
until it was too late.

04:03.064 --> 04:05.431
It's a single stab wound,
as far as I can tell.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.400
Maximum damage in minimum time.

04:07.402 --> 04:09.068
- Anything on the killer?
- Oh, yeah.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.837
Spoke to multiple witnesses

04:10.839 --> 04:12.372
who positively I.D.'d
the suspect.

04:12.374 --> 04:15.375
Unfortunately,
they all described him.

04:16.511 --> 04:19.379
Nick Torres. How you doing?

04:19.380 --> 04:21.414
I'm Gregorio.
I'd be better if you had more

04:21.416 --> 04:24.117
on the murder suspect than just
“wearing a harlequin costume.”

04:24.119 --> 04:25.552
So embarrassing.
I had no idea

04:25.554 --> 04:27.187
that was a common
fashion statement here.

04:27.189 --> 04:28.621
Krewe of Commedia.

04:28.623 --> 04:29.856
They had their
annual party here.

04:29.858 --> 04:31.658
Uh, crew of what now?

04:31.660 --> 04:33.960
It's a New Orleans thing
I'm still not clear on.

04:33.962 --> 04:35.395
It means there were
over a hundred Harlequins

04:35.397 --> 04:36.629
dressed like that last night.

04:36.631 --> 04:39.299
NOPD's interviewing as many
as they can round up.

04:39.301 --> 04:41.968
Anyone who can kill like this
had an escape route--

04:41.970 --> 04:43.636
long gone.

04:43.638 --> 04:45.972
Oh, man, that's so gross.

04:45.974 --> 04:47.540
What you got there, Sebastian?

04:47.542 --> 04:49.943
Victim's cell phone.
And probably a case of hep C,

04:49.945 --> 04:51.511
considering this gutter
I just pulled it out of.

04:51.513 --> 04:52.912
I'm gonna need to go home
and take, like,

04:52.914 --> 04:54.380
a long Silkwood shower.

04:54.382 --> 04:57.383
Looks water damaged.
Can you retrieve the data?

04:57.385 --> 04:59.285
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.

04:59.287 --> 05:00.653
Gregorio,

05:00.655 --> 05:02.021
check surveillance.
We need something more

05:02.023 --> 05:04.390
on our killer
other than he looks like

05:04.392 --> 05:05.491
Torres here.

05:05.493 --> 05:07.660
Mm-hmm.
So, Ferdinand

05:07.662 --> 05:10.263
was here to meet up with
whoever stole the Playbook.

05:10.265 --> 05:11.998
Any update on who that might be?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.733
That would be
McGee's department.

05:13.735 --> 05:16.002
Where's McGee?

05:16.004 --> 05:18.271
It is absolutely crazy
out there.

05:19.407 --> 05:21.074
Agent McGee,
finally in New Orleans.

05:21.076 --> 05:22.175
How you doing?

05:22.177 --> 05:23.843
And your first Mardi Gras
in the quarter.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.279
I see you've already caught on
to the New Orleans vibe.

05:26.281 --> 05:27.914
Day drinking is step one.

05:27.916 --> 05:29.115
I-I am not day drinking.

05:29.117 --> 05:30.483
Someone forced this
into my hand.

05:30.485 --> 05:32.252
Yeah, if you say so,
glitter boo.

05:32.991 --> 05:34.537
I do, uh, come
bearing gifts, however.

05:34.538 --> 05:35.335
Can I use your computer?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.303
Absolutely.

05:37.305 --> 05:39.672
Been tracking the digital trail
of whoever stole the Playbook

05:39.674 --> 05:41.307
in the first place.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.342
They've been making some
moves the last couple days.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.977
Yeah? What kind of moves?

05:44.979 --> 05:47.379
NSA's had an uptick in their
chatter about the Playbook.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.582
Thief is putting it
up for auction.

05:49.584 --> 05:50.916
It's going to the
highest bidder.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.885
So multiple bad actors

05:52.887 --> 05:55.754
from all over the globe
trying to make a bid.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.122
Timothy McGee.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.091
Make yourself at home.
Hey.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.326
How are you?
Good.

06:00.328 --> 06:01.493
Morning.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.494
So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras

06:02.496 --> 06:04.463
is perfect
for an auction like this.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.698
Million visitors
in the city,

06:05.700 --> 06:07.132
half of them in masks.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.435
Easy to slip in and out
without being seen.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.870
Well, then let's
hit the streets.

06:10.872 --> 06:12.571
Let's get that Playbook back.

06:12.573 --> 06:16.041
Uh, you're not hitting anything
after last night.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.611
Hey, I took initiative to
contact Ferdinand Pisco.

06:18.613 --> 06:20.279
I'm not the reason the
operation went sour.

06:20.281 --> 06:22.381
I'm not the one
you need to convince.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.816
Hey, boss.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.651
Yeah.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.553
He's right here.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.755
Actually, he wants
to talk to Pride.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.925
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?

06:32.927 --> 06:34.360
Wish Homeland's mess

06:34.362 --> 06:36.495
hadn't ended up in our backyard,
but we'll deal with it.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.497
Got backup available
if you want it.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.965
More agents means
more questions.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.934
I want to keep this contained.

06:41.936 --> 06:44.470
That's gonna be hard to do.
We've got a rogue's gallery

06:44.472 --> 06:46.705
of international operatives
descending on New Orleans.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.207
Every agency in D.C. wants in.

06:48.209 --> 06:49.675
I just got through

06:49.677 --> 06:52.278
hand-holding the FBI on
the Javier Garcia case.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.579
Don't need a sequel.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.314
Roger that.
I'll run interference.

06:55.316 --> 06:56.715
Appreciate it, Jethro.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.385
You always had a gentler
way with the suits.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.856
Sorry, that wasn't a joke?

07:03.858 --> 07:05.391
Send Torres in.

07:05.393 --> 07:06.992
We need to talk.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.027
You got it, boss.

07:08.029 --> 07:09.762
McGee.
Yeah, boss?

07:09.764 --> 07:11.163
What is that around your neck?

07:11.165 --> 07:14.333
Oh, uh, they're beads.
It's a festive thing.

07:14.335 --> 07:16.101
Trying to get
into the--

07:16.103 --> 07:17.636
Never mind.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.972
Wrong door.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.213
So I was able to retrieve data

07:28.215 --> 07:30.134
off of Ferdinand Pisco's
busted cell phone.

07:30.135 --> 07:31.791
- What'd you get?
- Texts.

07:31.792 --> 07:34.365
He was, uh, communicating
with whoever stole the Playbook.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.493
They were supposed to meet
in the Quarter.

07:35.494 --> 07:38.461
Yeah, someone killed Pisco
before the meeting took place.

07:38.463 --> 07:40.330
Well, able to get us
anything on Pisco

07:40.332 --> 07:42.065
or the thief from the texts?
No.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.634
But I was able to trace the
serial number from the phone,

07:44.636 --> 07:46.669
and it was one of
five burner phones

07:46.671 --> 07:49.839
purchased together at
an airport kiosk a few days ago.

07:49.841 --> 07:51.535
Five phones
can mean five buyers.

07:51.559 --> 07:54.677
All we have to do is track the phones,
and we find all the buyers.

07:54.679 --> 07:56.312
Tracking the phones
isn't that easy.

07:56.314 --> 07:59.115
Can't you just trace the ping
from the cellular towers

07:59.117 --> 08:00.783
and triangulate or whatever?

08:00.785 --> 08:02.919
No, it's-it's
2017 now, Sonja.

08:02.921 --> 08:04.821
The era of the ping
is long gone.

08:04.823 --> 08:06.890
Even cheap burner phones
are GPS enabled.

08:06.892 --> 08:09.392
You know, the real
GPS tracking expert is Patton,

08:09.394 --> 08:12.662
and he's off consulting JSOC
on some online security issue.

08:12.664 --> 08:14.864
Hey, you know, uh,
I don't mean to brag,

08:14.866 --> 08:17.500
but I wrote an algorithm that
is kind of a game changer

08:17.502 --> 08:19.102
in satellite circles.

08:19.104 --> 08:20.803
- Geez.
- You're...

08:20.805 --> 08:23.640
you're, uh...
you're McGee, right?

08:23.642 --> 08:25.074
Uh, yeah, yeah.

08:25.076 --> 08:27.277
Yeah. I'm Sebastian.
I-I've heard so much about you.

08:27.279 --> 08:28.945
Oh, you have?

08:28.947 --> 08:31.381
Well, you went from tech support
to special agent overnight.

08:31.383 --> 08:33.183
Sort of a legend at FLETC.

08:33.184 --> 08:34.317
At least, you know, to me.

08:34.318 --> 08:35.418
It-it wasn't
quite that simple.

08:35.419 --> 08:37.187
But, uh, this is.
Oh.

08:37.188 --> 08:39.155
Let me show you this.
All you need to do is

08:39.157 --> 08:40.957
enter the serial numbers.

08:46.031 --> 08:48.131
Whoa, this is,
this is amazing.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.833
There's no way that this is,
uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.

08:50.835 --> 08:52.769
No, no, no. Rigid tracking's
no good. Satellite phones

08:52.771 --> 08:54.237
are always on the move,
so this is

08:54.239 --> 08:56.573
a geosynchronous
step track processing,

08:56.575 --> 08:57.758
with a little bit of
pizzazz on the side.

08:57.759 --> 08:59.376
Of course.
Yeah, makes total sense.

08:59.377 --> 09:00.677
To who?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.881
Oh, wait. One of the burner
phones just powered on.

09:04.883 --> 09:06.449
Somewhere near
Armstrong Park.

09:06.451 --> 09:07.651
I'm getting the exact
coordinates now.

09:07.675 --> 09:09.675
Nice.

09:20.799 --> 09:23.199
Got a lot of tourists
and a bunch of drunks.

09:23.201 --> 09:24.667
Not sure who
we're looking for.

09:24.669 --> 09:26.636
Any clues to help us out,
Sebastian?

09:26.638 --> 09:28.972
All I can tell you
is that whoever is using

09:28.974 --> 09:31.374
that burner phone
is actively texting right now.

09:33.245 --> 09:34.711
Well, think I
see our target.

09:34.713 --> 09:37.880
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to turn around,

09:37.882 --> 09:39.449
put your hands in the air!

09:44.856 --> 09:46.122
She's dead.

09:46.124 --> 09:48.424
Stabbed just like Pisco.

09:48.426 --> 09:50.960
It just happened.

09:50.962 --> 09:53.563
Yeah, and whoever
did it was just here.

10:12.872 --> 10:14.839
According to DNA,
this is Monica Grange.

10:14.841 --> 10:17.475
U.S. citizen traveling
under a Canadian alias.

10:17.477 --> 10:19.177
Wanted in four
different countries

10:19.179 --> 10:21.212
for ties to a Syrian
terrorist group.

10:21.214 --> 10:23.815
Yeah, been off the grid
for years acting as a middleman,

10:23.817 --> 10:26.050
buying weapons, Intel,
explosives.

10:26.052 --> 10:27.385
Probably in town

10:27.387 --> 10:29.287
to bid for the Playbook,
just like Ferdinand.

10:29.289 --> 10:30.588
And just like Ferdinand,

10:30.590 --> 10:32.423
she got stabbed before
she could make contact

10:32.425 --> 10:34.058
with whoever the seller is.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.061
Two operatives in town
murdered within a day.

10:37.063 --> 10:39.564
Killer could be another buyer
taking out the competition.

10:39.566 --> 10:42.433
Easier to negotiate
if everyone else is dead.

10:42.435 --> 10:44.402
Well, Sebastian and McGee
are tracking down

10:44.404 --> 10:46.471
the remaining burner
phones and buyers.

10:46.473 --> 10:49.140
Well, as for
our killer, all we got is

10:49.142 --> 10:52.477
footage of the suspect
running away last night.

10:52.479 --> 10:55.213
So how do we get
the Playbook back?

10:55.215 --> 10:56.581
Talk to me.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.816
Monica Grange was corresponding
with the killer before she died.

10:58.818 --> 11:00.118
They were supposed
to meet tonight.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.419
We have
Monica's phone.

11:01.421 --> 11:03.354
I have a clean identity.
Set up a meet.

11:03.356 --> 11:04.922
I'll go in
in her place.

11:04.924 --> 11:06.657
Seller's proven to be careful--
not gonna have

11:06.659 --> 11:08.359
the Playbook on him
at the meeting.

11:08.361 --> 11:11.496
Anyone but a woman shows up,
seller could spook.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.064
Well, what if I go in as Monica?

11:13.066 --> 11:15.900
I mean, she's been off the grid,
no current photo.

11:15.902 --> 11:17.969
Seller will have no idea.

11:17.971 --> 11:19.303
Seller will have every idea.

11:19.305 --> 11:21.105
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.

11:21.107 --> 11:22.974
You trying to say I smell?
No, I'm saying

11:22.976 --> 11:24.876
that undercover work
takes a certain flair.

11:24.878 --> 11:27.178
Like the flair you had last
night when you got arrested?

11:27.180 --> 11:28.579
Oh, really? We're gonna do that?

11:28.581 --> 11:29.947
Look, all I'm trying
to say is

11:29.949 --> 11:32.083
if we want to get
the Playbook back <i>quietly,</i>

11:32.085 --> 11:33.484
then I'm your girl.

11:33.486 --> 11:34.952
Gregorio's right.

11:34.954 --> 11:36.487
Study up on Monica Grange

11:36.489 --> 11:37.989
until the seller
reaches out.

11:37.991 --> 11:40.091
I got to go to autopsy.

11:43.997 --> 11:45.430
What'd you find, Loretta?

11:45.432 --> 11:48.099
Frightful
symmetry, I'm afraid.

11:48.101 --> 11:51.702
Both victims killed with a
single stab between the ribs...

11:53.506 --> 11:55.440
...puncturing the heart,
bled out within moments.

11:55.442 --> 11:57.175
Probably didn't even realize
they were stabbed

11:57.177 --> 11:58.476
before it was too late.

11:58.478 --> 11:59.477
The weapon was thin-bladed.

11:59.479 --> 12:01.212
Stiletto, most likely.

12:01.214 --> 12:03.881
Killer's a skilled expert who
can slip in and out of a crowd

12:03.883 --> 12:05.950
without being noticed.
Yeah, no sign of fibers,

12:05.952 --> 12:07.452
DNA, fingerprints.

12:07.454 --> 12:08.853
Trained intelligence agent?

12:08.855 --> 12:10.188
Or an assassin.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.557
Whoever the killer is,
we need to contain him now.

12:12.559 --> 12:14.592
A highly skilled assassin

12:14.594 --> 12:17.195
roaming the streets
of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.

12:17.197 --> 12:18.863
Dwayne.

12:19.799 --> 12:22.033
Maybe it's time
to call in the cavalry.

12:22.035 --> 12:24.268
Well, if we do that, it won't
just be the FBI coming.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.504
Be CIA, too.
Yeah, and those guys suck.

12:26.506 --> 12:28.272
Yeah, it'll be like
the Wild West.

12:29.642 --> 12:31.576
Can't let that happen.
Sebastian,

12:31.578 --> 12:33.044
tell me you got
good news.

12:33.046 --> 12:35.279
McGee and I were able to hack
the last three burner phones.

12:35.281 --> 12:37.081
Means we can track
their locations.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.749
Yeah, well,
we can do better than that.

12:38.751 --> 12:40.318
We're gonna draw
the buyers to us.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.920
Send them text messages,
pretending to be the seller,

12:42.922 --> 12:46.290
then sweep them up--
classic false flag operation.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.359
And what does that mean,
exactly?

12:48.361 --> 12:49.927
I have no idea--
something that McGee said.

12:49.929 --> 12:51.295
But it sounds really cool,
right?

12:51.297 --> 12:53.397
Chris, Sonja,

12:53.399 --> 12:55.766
help McGee and Sebastian
bring in the buyers.

12:55.768 --> 12:58.569
And remember, any one of them
could be our killer.

12:58.571 --> 13:00.338
Need you to proceed
with caution.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.173
You got it.

13:03.142 --> 13:04.342
That's the entirety

13:04.344 --> 13:05.877
of Interpol's file
on Monica Grange.

13:05.879 --> 13:07.245
It's barely a page long.

13:07.247 --> 13:08.579
It'll have to do.

13:08.581 --> 13:10.348
She's a lawyer
by profession,

13:10.350 --> 13:12.283
so you're gonna have to pretend
like you understand law.

13:12.285 --> 13:13.584
Don't need to pretend.

13:13.586 --> 13:16.654
I am a lawyer; went to law
school before joining the FBI.

13:16.656 --> 13:19.090
She's fluent in Arabic.

13:19.092 --> 13:21.359
I'm assuming you're not.

13:21.361 --> 13:23.227
No, but I dated

13:23.229 --> 13:26.497
an Egyptian once
and learned a phrase or two.

13:26.499 --> 13:28.132
You know, you're pretty cocky

13:28.134 --> 13:30.101
for someone that's
never worked undercover before.

13:30.103 --> 13:32.169
Oh, I've worked
undercover ops before.

13:32.171 --> 13:34.805
Yeah, well, I'm not talking
about a couple of days

13:34.807 --> 13:36.474
of playing make-believe,

13:36.476 --> 13:39.110
take down a drug dealer.

13:39.112 --> 13:40.545
I'm talking about

13:40.547 --> 13:43.848
spending years
being another person.

13:43.850 --> 13:47.585
So long that you...

13:47.587 --> 13:49.320
you forget who you really are.

13:49.322 --> 13:51.222
Fascinating.

13:51.224 --> 13:54.392
But all I need is an hour or two
to get the Playbook back, so...

13:54.394 --> 13:56.294
And all you need
is to screw up once,

13:56.296 --> 13:58.262
and this entire situation
goes pear-shaped.

13:58.264 --> 14:00.531
You know, I may not
be fluent in Arabic,

14:00.533 --> 14:02.400
but I am fluent
in body language,

14:02.402 --> 14:05.403
and it's killing you
to ride the bench.

14:05.405 --> 14:08.472
It's killing me
to ride the bench.

14:10.243 --> 14:12.677
You know, I'm not a bench guy;
I'm an on-the-field kind of guy.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.145
Not much of a
team player, huh?

14:14.147 --> 14:16.681
No, this, uh...

14:16.683 --> 14:19.317
team thing
has been pretty recent.

14:19.319 --> 14:20.384
It's an adjustment.

14:20.386 --> 14:22.353
I get it. It's not easy
being the new guy

14:22.355 --> 14:23.888
with a group that's
worked so long together.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.656
Yeah, I mean,
inside jokes alone...

14:25.658 --> 14:27.558
Yeah, and you're never
fully confident that

14:27.560 --> 14:30.027
they actually need you, right?
It's, like, what am I doing?

14:30.029 --> 14:31.462
Exactly.

14:31.464 --> 14:32.897
Well, I'm gonna need you,
Torres,

14:32.899 --> 14:34.699
'cause I have
no idea what I'm doing.

14:34.701 --> 14:36.334
So let's just start there,
all right?

14:40.807 --> 14:42.173
It's the seller.

14:42.175 --> 14:43.307
Meeting's at 8:00.

14:43.309 --> 14:44.575
Sazerac Bar.

14:44.577 --> 14:46.344
I'll let Pride know.

14:56.689 --> 14:58.856
Not gonna want
to do that, Sebastian.

14:58.858 --> 15:01.092
Keep your eyes forward
or on me.

15:01.094 --> 15:02.994
Well, how-how will we know
when the target's here?

15:02.996 --> 15:04.128
Window reflections.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.530
Got a security
mirror up there.

15:06.532 --> 15:09.867
There's about five other ways to
know what's going on behind us.

15:09.869 --> 15:12.103
What, I still got glitter
in my hair?

15:12.105 --> 15:13.104
No.

15:13.106 --> 15:14.805
Well, yeah, but that's not it.

15:14.807 --> 15:16.874
You're a nerd
like me, you know?

15:16.876 --> 15:18.943
But you're, like,
this badass nerd.

15:18.945 --> 15:20.645
You're so good at this.

15:20.647 --> 15:22.313
Eh. Just have more experience.

15:22.315 --> 15:23.948
No, you-you make it look easy.

15:23.950 --> 15:26.050
I just keep
messing up.

15:26.052 --> 15:27.485
Look...

15:27.487 --> 15:30.554
when I was a probie,
I messed up all the time.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.156
Okay? I made a ton
of mistakes.

15:32.158 --> 15:34.191
But I was fortunate;
I had some key mentors

15:34.193 --> 15:35.826
that showed me the ropes.

15:35.828 --> 15:38.129
Well, they must have been very
patient and forgiving, then.

15:38.131 --> 15:39.730
They were merciless.
Downright mean sometimes.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.132
But you know what?

15:41.134 --> 15:43.467
They always had my six,
and I always had theirs.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.005
Buyer's here.

15:49.676 --> 15:51.375
The windbreaker,
duck boots.

15:51.377 --> 15:52.743
All right.

15:52.745 --> 15:55.646
All right, I'll send him out
to the alley away from everyone,

15:55.648 --> 15:57.715
so we can pick him up there.
All right.

15:57.717 --> 15:59.383
All right, you zig, I zag.
What, now? What's that?

15:59.385 --> 16:01.719
Follow him.
Okay, yeah, all right.

16:21.441 --> 16:22.873
Hi. Uh...

16:22.875 --> 16:24.275
I'm a federal agent...

16:28.281 --> 16:29.747
Stop-stop resisting.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.049
Stop resisting.
It's gonna be okay.

16:32.051 --> 16:33.451
Just...

16:34.220 --> 16:35.586
We're all gonna be fine.

16:43.029 --> 16:45.396
What was that, like, a...
like, a Vulcan nerve pinch?

16:45.398 --> 16:47.732
Mossad technique
an old friend of mine taught me.

16:47.734 --> 16:50.768
All right, we got to get him
up here, get him in the car.

16:50.770 --> 16:52.136
Yeah. No problem.

16:53.072 --> 16:54.638
Okay.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.507
Kind of wish we didn't
park so far away.

16:56.509 --> 16:57.908

That the seller
or just a come-on?

17:57.937 --> 17:59.670
She's the seller.

17:59.672 --> 18:01.438
Eva Azarova.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.440
Russian sleeper agent.

18:03.442 --> 18:06.544
Sort of helped us out of a mess
we were in last year.

18:06.546 --> 18:07.912
Sort of?

18:07.914 --> 18:09.613
She happened to be responsible
for the mess

18:09.615 --> 18:11.816
- in the first place.
- I make it a rule

18:11.818 --> 18:13.284
not to take drinks
from strangers.

18:13.286 --> 18:14.819
You never know what's in it.

18:14.821 --> 18:18.055
Mm. I don't think it's the drink
you need to worry about.

exactly who you are.

18:37.609 --> 18:41.244

18:41.246 --> 18:43.513
I'm Monica Grange.

18:43.515 --> 18:46.683
You should know that
because you invited me.

18:53.492 --> 18:55.192
That's Arabic.

18:55.194 --> 18:57.194
Monica's fluent.
Gregorio's not.

18:57.196 --> 18:58.795
Counts as sideways to me, Pride.

18:58.797 --> 19:00.397
Hold on, Torres.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.852
Don't know that saying.
It's beautiful.

19:22.854 --> 19:24.754
What does it mean?

19:24.756 --> 19:27.324
It means you're not
the only one who came armed.

19:29.761 --> 19:31.728
Might have an issue, Torres.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.597
Might need you
to cover the front door.

19:33.599 --> 19:36.299
Let's not cause a scene.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.669
Let's relax
and enjoy our drinks.

19:39.671 --> 19:43.473

enjoy the company as well.

19:55.387 --> 19:57.053
on the suspect who
stole the Playbook.

19:57.055 --> 19:58.221
Good.

19:58.223 --> 20:00.724
Eva Azarova?

20:00.726 --> 20:03.526
I thought we put her away
last year for espionage.

20:03.528 --> 20:05.295
Yeah. Guess she escaped,
somehow got the Playbook.

20:05.297 --> 20:06.796
Now she's trying
to sell it.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.131
Gregorio's made contact.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.699
Well, hopefully, she
gets the Playbook back

20:09.701 --> 20:11.134
before anyone
else gets hurt.

20:11.136 --> 20:12.602
Yeah. Meanwhile, we've got

20:12.604 --> 20:14.404
two out of the three
foreign buyers in custody.

20:14.406 --> 20:16.806
Though ours isn't talking.

20:16.808 --> 20:18.608
Yeah, North Korean operative.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.011
Just sits there like he doesn't
understand a word we're saying,

20:21.013 --> 20:22.812
smiling and nodding.

20:22.814 --> 20:24.114
You guys have any better luck?

20:24.116 --> 20:25.582
No. Although, oh, man,

20:25.584 --> 20:27.117
you guys should've been
in interrogation

20:27.119 --> 20:29.052
to see McGee go to work.

20:29.054 --> 20:30.387
He did this whole
no-talking thing

20:30.389 --> 20:31.688
that completely
freaked our guy out.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.423
I mean, he ended up
telling us his entire

20:33.425 --> 20:36.126
life story just
to get McGee to speak.

20:36.128 --> 20:37.994
So cool.

20:37.996 --> 20:39.262
What?

20:39.264 --> 20:41.197
You really like McGee,
don't you?

20:41.199 --> 20:43.300
Yeah, bit of a man crush,
you ask me.

20:43.302 --> 20:45.435
It's a total
man crush, yeah.

20:45.437 --> 20:47.937
Also, it's like looking
into a crystal ball

20:47.939 --> 20:49.639
to see what I could
potentially become.

20:49.641 --> 20:52.309
You know? I mean, McGee is
basically future Sebastian.

20:52.311 --> 20:53.977
Well, where's
future Sebastian now?

20:53.979 --> 20:56.713
He's in Patton's office trying
to track the final burner phone.

20:56.715 --> 20:57.947
No luck so far, though.

20:57.949 --> 20:59.983
It hasn't even
been turned on.

20:59.985 --> 21:02.419
Well, two of the other buyers
were murdered,

21:02.421 --> 21:04.621
so maybe whoever has
the other phone is dead, too.

21:04.623 --> 21:05.922
Or he could be

21:05.924 --> 21:08.191
the killer, take out the
competition for the Playbook.

21:08.193 --> 21:09.959
Well, all we know

21:09.961 --> 21:12.262
about the killer is that he was
wearing a Mardi Gras costume,

21:12.264 --> 21:14.397
and he's good with a knife.
I mean, we need more.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.566
Well, that's what
I've been working on.

21:16.568 --> 21:19.336
So, we have about ten seconds
of surveillance video

21:19.338 --> 21:20.837
from the night
Ferdinand Pisco was killed.

21:20.839 --> 21:22.339
I'm using a special
computer program

21:22.341 --> 21:24.240
to analyze
the suspect's gait--

21:24.242 --> 21:25.809
stride length, height,
measurements.

21:25.811 --> 21:28.378
It can even predict gender.
Is this for real?

21:28.380 --> 21:30.980
I'm gonna cross-check the
results against our database,

21:30.982 --> 21:32.849
and hopefully come up
with a viable suspect.

21:32.851 --> 21:34.617
Yeah, well, keep at it,
Past Sebastian.

21:34.619 --> 21:35.785
Yeah.

21:43.228 --> 21:45.595
You're not at all

22:01.046 --> 22:03.380
you think you might bring up

or is that a like a second date

22:05.083 --> 22:06.383
type of question?

22:06.385 --> 22:07.584
Do I disappoint?

22:07.586 --> 22:09.119
Not in the least.

22:09.121 --> 22:10.387
Honestly, Pride, how long

22:10.389 --> 22:12.021
are we gonna go on
with the foreplay?

22:12.023 --> 22:14.157
Gregorio, you might want
to give her a push.

22:15.227 --> 22:17.293
Well, let's talk business.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.963
My employer is eager
to make an offer.

22:19.965 --> 22:23.600
I haven't decided
if I'm entertaining an offer.

22:23.602 --> 22:26.002
Well, what else do I have to do
to convince you?

22:26.004 --> 22:27.604

22:27.606 --> 22:28.638

22:28.640 --> 22:30.673

gonna get to see the Playbook.

22:33.412 --> 22:36.012

22:51.963 --> 22:54.130

Hmm.

23:16.822 --> 23:18.888

23:18.890 --> 23:21.658
View of the Quarter.
Very nice.

23:21.660 --> 23:24.093
Tenth floor,
east side of the hotel.

23:24.095 --> 23:26.696
You say the word,
I'm on the move.

23:28.133 --> 23:31.234
I didn't book the room
because of the view.

23:31.236 --> 23:33.570
Balcony gives me access
to the roof.

23:33.572 --> 23:35.004
Escape route

23:36.174 --> 23:38.174

23:38.877 --> 23:40.977
Only way to survive in our line.

23:40.979 --> 23:42.445
Gets tiring, though.

23:42.447 --> 23:44.013
Why do it?

23:44.015 --> 23:46.015
I've got my reasons.

23:46.017 --> 23:47.417
Here's the Playbook.

23:47.419 --> 23:50.353
Voice activation security
needs my voice.

23:56.094 --> 23:58.661
Have a look.

24:08.106 --> 24:09.906
- Sebastian.
- Pride.

24:09.908 --> 24:12.141
I just got a hit back on that
gait analysis I was running.

24:12.143 --> 24:13.576
What's gait analysis?

24:13.578 --> 24:15.178
It's too complicated
to explain right now.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.947
Bottom line, we got an I.D.
on our murder suspect.

24:17.949 --> 24:20.083
Eva Azarova came back
as a match.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.484
Are you sure?

24:21.486 --> 24:22.519
Program's not 100% accurate,

24:22.521 --> 24:24.254
but, yeah,
I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.288
Torres,

24:25.290 --> 24:26.589
Gregorio's up there
with our killer.

24:26.591 --> 24:27.557
I got the room.

24:27.559 --> 24:29.425
You cover the back

24:29.427 --> 24:30.793
in case she tries to escape.

24:30.795 --> 24:31.928
Copy.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.329
Gregorio, do you hear that?

24:33.331 --> 24:34.864
Got confirmation
that Eva's responsible

24:34.866 --> 24:36.466
for Ferdinand's murder.

24:36.468 --> 24:38.635
I'm on my way, but you need
to get out of there now.

24:38.637 --> 24:42.038
Everything seems in order.
I'll reach out to my employer...

24:42.040 --> 24:44.007
I know you're not
Monica Grange,

24:44.009 --> 24:45.842
because I watched her
die this morning.

24:45.844 --> 24:47.911
I thought Victor
may have sent you

24:47.913 --> 24:50.547
because you're
definitely his type.

24:50.549 --> 24:54.150
I don't even know who Victor is,
but you got bigger problems

24:54.152 --> 24:56.719
'cause you're pointing
a knife at a federal agent.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.006
Drop it!

25:17.008 --> 25:18.274
Now!

25:21.246 --> 25:23.246
Pride, I got the suspect
in custody.

25:23.248 --> 25:24.881
Copy that. Almost there.

25:24.883 --> 25:26.282
Pride?

25:26.284 --> 25:27.584
You're NCIS.

25:27.586 --> 25:29.018
Yeah.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.587
And you're under arrest
for espionage

25:30.589 --> 25:33.089
and the murder of Ferdinand
Pisco and Monica Grange.

25:33.091 --> 25:35.825
Well, you got me on espionage,
but I didn't kill those people.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.894
Oh, yeah? Then who did?

25:39.564 --> 25:41.531
Same person who just did that.

25:54.713 --> 25:56.012
You hit?
No.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.013
Stay there.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.648
Gregorio?

25:58.650 --> 26:01.050
You okay?

26:01.052 --> 26:02.685
Two gunmen went out the balcony.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.554
They have the Playbook.

26:04.556 --> 26:07.690
Torres, two suspects
headed your way, armed.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.227
Torres, do you copy?

26:11.229 --> 26:14.297
Agent Torres is
unable to respond.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.133
Who is this?

26:17.135 --> 26:18.568
The man you'll be
negotiating with

26:18.570 --> 26:20.303
if you want
Torres back alive.

26:20.305 --> 26:23.506
Ask Eva what happens
if you don't comply.

26:23.508 --> 26:25.675
I'll expect your call.

26:44.843 --> 26:47.077
Just got off the phone
with Director Vance,

26:47.079 --> 26:49.846
who's ready to send the Marines
down to get Torres back.

26:49.848 --> 26:51.481
What do we know?
Not much.

26:51.483 --> 26:53.350
Torres and the Playbook
were taken last night

26:53.352 --> 26:56.119
by three gunmen in a black SUV
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

26:56.121 --> 26:58.088
Sebastian and McGee are trying
to track the movements

26:58.090 --> 27:00.757
of that SUV, but it seems like
it vanished into thin air.

27:00.759 --> 27:03.593
This Victor's good at
what he does, whoever he is.

27:03.595 --> 27:05.562
Well, Eva seems to know
exactly who he is.

27:05.564 --> 27:07.330
It's like she was
expecting him last night.

27:07.332 --> 27:08.932
He could be the fifth buyer,

27:08.934 --> 27:10.800
responsible for killing
the others.

27:10.802 --> 27:12.535
Yeah, laying in wait
at the hotel

27:12.537 --> 27:14.237
last night to grab the Playbook.

27:14.239 --> 27:15.905
But Eva was there
when Ferdinand Pisco

27:15.907 --> 27:18.575
and Monica Grange
were killed. Why?

27:18.577 --> 27:21.111
It's a lot
of unanswered questions.

27:21.113 --> 27:23.179
Like, is Torres
even still alive?

27:23.181 --> 27:26.249
Torres is alive because Victor
needs him as a bargaining chip.

27:26.251 --> 27:27.751
Well, Playbook
can't be opened

27:27.753 --> 27:29.452
without Eva's
voice verification.

27:29.454 --> 27:32.255
And Eva's the one person
who might be able to fill in

27:32.257 --> 27:34.357
the rest of the blanks for us.
Let's go, Gregorio.

27:34.359 --> 27:36.259
Keep digging.

27:42.934 --> 27:46.002
I was hoping that my new friend
would join us.

27:46.004 --> 27:47.937
I didn't catch her real name.

27:47.939 --> 27:49.806
That's too bad.

27:49.808 --> 27:53.009
Never would have guessed
that she was a federal agent.

27:53.011 --> 27:55.011
Plus, she has
a mean right hook.

27:55.013 --> 27:57.013
I'll let her know.

27:57.015 --> 27:59.916
Right now, you need
to tell me who Victor is.

27:59.918 --> 28:02.319
Russian agent,

28:02.321 --> 28:04.187
vicious assassin,

28:04.189 --> 28:06.022
my mentor.

28:06.024 --> 28:09.025
Taught me
everything I know.

28:09.027 --> 28:12.562
We think he's responsible...

28:12.564 --> 28:14.964
for these two murders.

28:19.938 --> 28:22.038
Here we are again, Eva.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.374
Yup.

28:24.376 --> 28:26.876
You're accusing me
of crimes I didn't commit.

28:26.878 --> 28:28.111
But you did commit a crime.

28:28.113 --> 28:30.947
You stole the Playbook
from Homeland.

28:30.949 --> 28:32.549
Sell to the highest bidder.

28:32.551 --> 28:34.584
Never pegged you
as an opportunist.

28:34.586 --> 28:36.186
You're right.

28:36.188 --> 28:38.955
I was using it as bait
to draw Victor out.

28:38.957 --> 28:40.757
Your mentor.

28:42.194 --> 28:44.794
He recruited me
when I was just a child.

28:47.032 --> 28:48.698
He took me from my family.

28:48.700 --> 28:51.935
He made me do...
terrible things.

28:53.605 --> 28:55.071
He turned me into this.

28:55.073 --> 28:56.740
Woman without a country.

28:57.909 --> 29:00.009
I saw an opportunity
to pay him back,

29:00.011 --> 29:02.145
'cause I knew that he
would come crawling out

29:02.147 --> 29:05.415
from under his rock if
the Playbook was up for grabs.

29:05.417 --> 29:08.151
It's too big a prize.

29:08.153 --> 29:09.953
And then I would have justice.

29:09.955 --> 29:14.357
Two people are dead
because of your justice.

29:14.359 --> 29:16.126
Victor has the Playbook

29:16.128 --> 29:19.095
and one of our agents.

29:19.097 --> 29:21.598
You need me to get him back.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.266
Trade me for your agent.

29:23.268 --> 29:26.236
And we'll take
Victor down together.

29:26.238 --> 29:30.607
Well, problem is,
the way you've acted...

29:30.609 --> 29:33.309
don't know how
I can afford to trust you.

29:35.113 --> 29:37.147
How can you afford not to?

29:47.826 --> 29:50.093
Not sure we can
take Eva at her word.

29:50.095 --> 29:51.361
I'm sure we can't.

29:51.363 --> 29:53.062
I know that look in her eyes.

29:53.064 --> 29:54.964
She's hell-bent on revenge.
I get it.

29:54.966 --> 29:57.300
If I had a chance
to take down my ex-husband

29:57.302 --> 30:00.403
after all the crap he pulled,
nothing would stop me.

30:00.405 --> 30:03.640
We need a plan B to get Torres
and the Playbook back safely.

30:03.642 --> 30:06.042
McGee and I might have
what you're looking for.

30:10.482 --> 30:11.781
Hey.

30:11.783 --> 30:13.483
- Hey.
- Got footage

30:13.485 --> 30:16.052
of Victor's SUV leaving
the hotel late last night.

30:16.054 --> 30:17.921
- Before it disappeared into thin air?
- Actually, it didn't.

30:17.923 --> 30:19.756
The SUV passed
a number of cameras

30:19.758 --> 30:21.291
while it fled the scene.

30:21.293 --> 30:23.159
Yeah, traffic
cameras, security cameras,

30:23.161 --> 30:24.360
pedestrians' personal cameras...

30:24.362 --> 30:26.329
If we can access
that feed,

30:26.331 --> 30:28.565
we can piece together
exactly where the SUV went.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.099
We don't have the resources

30:30.101 --> 30:31.267
to consolidate
footage from

30:31.269 --> 30:33.736
dozens of sources
to find a single target.

30:33.738 --> 30:35.872
The NSA does.

30:35.874 --> 30:37.574
This case involves
national security

30:37.576 --> 30:39.509
and international espionage.

30:39.511 --> 30:42.178
I asked Bishop to call in some
favors from her old bosses.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.880
Yeah. We track the SUV
from here.

30:43.882 --> 30:45.381
Lasalle and Percy,
they're our boots on the ground

30:45.383 --> 30:46.483
while we gather Intel.

30:46.485 --> 30:47.617
We're-we're gonna find Torres.

30:47.619 --> 30:49.085
How legal is this, guys?

30:49.087 --> 30:51.554
Well, strictly speaking, we're
entering a bit of a gray zone.

30:51.556 --> 30:54.924
One of my team was taken by
a sociopathic Russian agent.

30:54.926 --> 30:56.726
I say screw the gray zone.

30:57.429 --> 30:59.729
We're with you, McGee.

30:59.731 --> 31:01.831
If it'll get
Torres back,

31:01.833 --> 31:03.900
get after it.

31:06.338 --> 31:08.137
We need to buy
them more time.

31:08.139 --> 31:10.306
No way Victor's sitting around,
waiting to get caught.

31:10.308 --> 31:12.308
Well, there's only one way
to keep Victor occupied

31:12.310 --> 31:15.111
while we search for him:
we need to put Eva into play.

31:21.353 --> 31:23.319
I'll call Torres's phone.

31:23.321 --> 31:26.623
See if I can make
contact with Victor.

31:28.994 --> 31:31.261
I was beginning to lose hope
you'd ever call.

31:31.263 --> 31:33.162
So was Agent Torres.

31:33.164 --> 31:35.064
Is he all right?
He's fine.

31:35.066 --> 31:37.333
I'll let you have him back
in return for my agent.

31:37.335 --> 31:40.236
The only reason you want Eva
back is to access the Playbook.

31:40.238 --> 31:43.072
Does it really matter,
with Torres's life on the line?

31:44.109 --> 31:45.842
I want to speak to him.

31:53.084 --> 31:55.118
Speak.

31:57.088 --> 31:58.588
Pride.

31:58.590 --> 32:01.491
You okay, Nick?

32:01.493 --> 32:03.293
Well, my allergies are acting up
'cause of all this drywall,

32:03.295 --> 32:05.428
but the view of
the parade route from here,

32:05.430 --> 32:07.830
it's, uh...
No hints, Agent Torres.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.165
Just say you're fine.

32:09.167 --> 32:11.601
I'm fine.

32:11.603 --> 32:14.237
I'll send a text where to
bring Eva for the trade.

32:14.239 --> 32:15.905
Once I have her,
I'll tell you where Torres is.

32:15.907 --> 32:17.941
No, no, no, no.
We do an even trade.

32:17.943 --> 32:20.143
Terms are non-negotiable.

32:24.316 --> 32:26.282
There's 50 ways
this goes south.

32:26.284 --> 32:28.985
That's optimistic.
I can think about 100.

32:32.290 --> 32:33.823
He wants us at

32:33.825 --> 32:36.392
the Huey P. Long Bridge
in 20 minutes.

32:44.002 --> 32:46.636
Keep this very simple,
and you don't go off book.

32:46.638 --> 32:47.837
Understand?

32:47.839 --> 32:49.505
Victor's gonna
go off book.

32:49.507 --> 32:51.541
He's gonna double-cross you.
That's what he does.

32:51.543 --> 32:54.510
Yeah, well, that's why we
have the tracking device.

32:54.512 --> 32:56.779
Keep tabs on Victor.

32:56.781 --> 32:58.414
Here I was thinking
you were just

32:58.416 --> 33:00.717
looking for an excuse
to get fresh.

33:00.719 --> 33:02.518
<i>Lasalle, what's the update?</i>

33:02.520 --> 33:05.154
Good news and bad news.

33:05.156 --> 33:06.656
Sebastian and McGee
were able to track down

33:06.658 --> 33:09.258
Victor's SUV till
its final destination.

33:09.260 --> 33:10.793
- You got eyes on it?
- Yeah.

33:10.795 --> 33:13.463
It's parked outside an
abandoned building in the CBD.

33:13.465 --> 33:14.631
Bad news?

33:14.633 --> 33:16.599
Well, the building's
30 stories tall.

33:16.601 --> 33:18.568
Torres might be inside,
and he might not.

33:18.570 --> 33:20.937
It's gonna take time to search
without alerting the Russians.

33:20.939 --> 33:23.673
Yeah, well, time's something
we're running out of.

33:23.675 --> 33:25.742
Start searching.

33:27.579 --> 33:29.646
I don't know about all this.

33:29.648 --> 33:31.948
What, you worried about
taking on some Russian spies

33:31.950 --> 33:33.650
who are probably
armed to the teeth?

33:33.652 --> 33:35.885
No. But I hate stairs,
and looks like we're about

33:35.887 --> 33:37.754
to take on a crapload of them.

33:44.396 --> 33:45.528
Send Eva alone.

33:45.530 --> 33:48.564
Two of you stay where you are.

33:50.802 --> 33:52.301
Do what he says.

33:52.303 --> 33:54.103
Be ready to
take him out.

33:54.105 --> 33:56.539
You'll be okay.

34:14.659 --> 34:18.226
Eva, it's been too long.

34:18.228 --> 34:19.462
Our turn now!

34:19.464 --> 34:21.264
Where's Torres?

34:21.266 --> 34:24.132
Once we're safely away,
I'll text you the address.

34:25.737 --> 34:27.003
Can't wait to catch up with you.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.071
Play your cards right,

34:28.072 --> 34:29.972
you just might survive
this mess.

34:31.141 --> 34:33.076
But you will not, Victor.

34:41.619 --> 34:43.085
What the hell did you just do?

34:43.088 --> 34:45.588
Something I've been waiting for
a long time.

34:45.590 --> 34:46.922
You just killed the one person

34:46.925 --> 34:48.824
who could help us
get Torres back.

35:08.575 --> 35:10.475
You really screwed
us here, Eva.

35:10.883 --> 35:12.583
Victor's guys
are waiting for his call.

35:12.585 --> 35:13.984
Now they'll kill Torres.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.520
He would've killed Torres
anyway. I did you a favor.

35:16.522 --> 35:18.455
How's that?
I bought you time.

35:18.457 --> 35:19.590
He would've slit

35:19.592 --> 35:21.658
your agent's throat
the minute we pulled away.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.227
Wait, Lasalle
and Sonja are already

35:23.229 --> 35:25.195
near Victor's hideout.
We need to call them

35:25.197 --> 35:28.265
and give them the exact location
so they can rescue Torres.

35:28.267 --> 35:29.733
I got an idea.

35:29.735 --> 35:31.535
But we're gonna need
her help again.

35:53.759 --> 35:55.492
She's stalling, but
it's not gonna work for long.

35:55.494 --> 35:56.593
What do you got?

35:56.595 --> 35:59.196
I have a trace
on the Russian's cell.

35:59.198 --> 36:00.397
All right.
Connecting to the GPS.

36:00.399 --> 36:03.167
Getting the exact
coordinates now.

36:04.970 --> 36:06.770
There it is. Bull's-eye. Guys!

36:06.772 --> 36:09.406
Guys, we got a hit!
Okay, Sebastian.

36:09.408 --> 36:10.507
Tell us where.

36:10.509 --> 36:12.209
And tell us softly, please.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.544
17th floor.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.578
Northeast side.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.540
You good?

36:43.542 --> 36:45.409
I'm good.

36:46.846 --> 36:49.113
What took you so long?

36:49.115 --> 36:51.181
You do realize it was, like,

36:51.183 --> 36:53.717
17 freakin' flights
of stairs, right?

36:55.554 --> 36:56.587
You know
I had him, right?

36:56.589 --> 36:58.088
Oh, yeah, you
definitely had him.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.491
Don't people usually
just say thank you?

37:00.493 --> 37:02.426
Oh, you're welcome.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.495
Should we
leave him tied up?

37:04.497 --> 37:06.029
Yes.

37:16.575 --> 37:19.143
Special Agent Torres.

37:19.145 --> 37:21.845
Glad to see
you survived your ordeal.

37:21.847 --> 37:24.748
Managed to get yourself
in the game.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.417
I told you I hate
riding the bench.

37:29.488 --> 37:31.021
You did good, too.

37:31.023 --> 37:33.323
Not bad for a couple
of new guys, right?

37:33.325 --> 37:35.359
Well, it's not six months
in an Ecuadorian prison

37:35.361 --> 37:38.061
just to set up cover, but, uh,

37:38.063 --> 37:40.230
yeah, not bad.

37:47.106 --> 37:49.306
Shoving off in five.

37:57.516 --> 37:59.483
Beautiful night.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.852
It'll be your last for a while.
Right.

38:01.854 --> 38:04.555
They don't have a lot of night
activities in federal prison.

38:04.557 --> 38:06.156
Yeah, well, you should've
thought about that

38:06.158 --> 38:07.524
before your little adventure.

38:07.526 --> 38:09.726
Believe it or not,
this is exactly how I thought

38:09.728 --> 38:11.128
it would all end.

38:11.130 --> 38:12.996
And it was completely worth it.

38:12.998 --> 38:16.233
Getting revenge was worth
a lifetime in prison?

38:16.235 --> 38:19.603
Meeting you was nice, too.

38:19.605 --> 38:21.038
Too bad we won't be able to get

38:21.040 --> 38:22.639
to know each other
a little better...

38:27.546 --> 38:30.013
Never say never.

38:44.263 --> 38:46.597
You sure you got to go?
You're gonna miss Mardi Gras.

38:46.599 --> 38:48.632
Hasn't this been Mardi Gras?
No, no, no, no.

38:48.634 --> 38:50.300
This has been the lead-up
to Mardi Gras.

38:50.302 --> 38:52.936
Actual Mardi Gras day is
when the city really goes off.

38:52.938 --> 38:55.272
Oh. You know what, I
think I've had my share

38:55.274 --> 38:57.007
of New Orleans
shenanigans.

38:57.009 --> 38:59.643
Maybe next year.
Mm.

38:59.645 --> 39:01.578
Uh...

39:01.580 --> 39:06.049
you think it's okay if maybe
I call you from time to time?

39:06.051 --> 39:07.818
Yeah, sure.

39:07.820 --> 39:10.420
The way you, uh, just asked me
made it sound a little weird.

39:10.422 --> 39:13.190
Well, you know, I just,
I might need some advice.

39:13.192 --> 39:15.592
Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.

39:15.594 --> 39:18.262
Okay. But you got to stop
calling me Future Sebastian.

39:18.264 --> 39:20.530
The fact is, you
are Past McGee.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.599
And doing a real
good job of it.

39:23.702 --> 39:25.269
Ah, there you are, McGee.

39:25.271 --> 39:27.804
I just dropped some food off
with Torres in the car.

39:27.806 --> 39:30.007
- A little snack for the road.
- Oh, appreciate that. Thank you.

39:30.009 --> 39:32.643
Pleasure. Listen, keep
an eye on Eva, okay?

39:32.645 --> 39:34.778
She's tricky.
You got it.

39:34.780 --> 39:36.680
- Jethro.
- Special Agent Pride.

39:36.682 --> 39:39.516
You'll be happy to know
I'm sending your team home

39:39.518 --> 39:41.952
mostly in one piece.

39:41.954 --> 39:44.588
Eh, you pulled it off
on your own. Not bad.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.424
I'm just glad we kept
all of official Washington

39:47.426 --> 39:48.659
from flooding the city.

39:48.661 --> 39:50.394
Yeah. This time, at least.

39:50.396 --> 39:52.496
Well, let's keep it that way.
What do you say?

39:52.498 --> 39:54.798
Unless, of course,
it's for a social visit.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.501
Next time there's another party,

39:57.503 --> 40:00.637
I might just pop down,
surprise you, Dwayne.

40:00.639 --> 40:02.606
This is New Orleans,
my brother.

40:02.608 --> 40:04.574
There's always
another party going on.
