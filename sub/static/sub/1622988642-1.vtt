Shadyside, small-town America.

00:06.541 --> 00:10.833
But among locals, a history of horror
has earned it another nickname,

00:11.500 --> 00:13.291
"Killer Capital USA."

00:14.541 --> 00:15.375

00:23.958 --> 00:26.708

are connected to Sarah Fier.

Sarah Fier was hanged for witchcraft.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.208
She's been possessing people,
turning them into killers,

there was one survivor, C. Berman.

[Deena] It's over.

with a massacre at the mall.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.291
And now an already mourning community
is plunged into horror yet again

02:11.375 --> 02:15.083
as the Sheriff's Department reports
more carnage at East Union Medical.

02:15.166 --> 02:18.291
Police believe the murders
were fueled by amphetamines.

02:18.375 --> 02:21.791
Local teenagers Kate Schmidt
and Simon Kalivoda

02:21.875 --> 02:23.666

you are fucking unbelievable, Cindy. OK?

-Maybe… Maybe he took a pill or--
-No!

No! Cindy, no!
It wasn't the fucking Tylenol, alright?

49:06.791 --> 49:07.916
It was the witch.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.083
Alright, you saw those names.

OK? Every name on that rock.

49:22.916 --> 49:24.541
And Mary knew it, alright?

She knew it. And it's all right here.

I can't like the weird girl.

Why not?

we'd throw toilet paper
on Mr. Corkle's tree,

in all our clothes and…
