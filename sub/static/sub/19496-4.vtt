11:35.380 --> 11:37.619
At a certain age, fertility...

11:37.620 --> 11:39.749
(laughs)
I'm not here for myself.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.919
I'm here for a client.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.879
Oh. You're an egg broker?

11:42.880 --> 11:44.919
No, a lawyer.
Uh, you used to be

11:44.920 --> 11:47.039
the Lake Drive
Fertility Clinic, Doctor?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.539
Yes, years ago.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.079
Actually, two years ago.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.209
Okay.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.879
I would call that years ago.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.209
Lake Drive had financial
troubles. We don't.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.829
How may I help you again?

11:58.830 --> 12:02.249
Uh, we called on behalf
our client, Laura Salano.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.539
You have 12 eggs of hers
in storage.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.539
Actually, that was Lake Drive
who had them in storage,

12:07.540 --> 12:09.079
the fertility
clinic we replaced.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.079
You mean the fertility clinic

12:11.080 --> 12:14.420
in the same building, with
the same medical director... you?

12:15.830 --> 12:17.459
Yes.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.039
Is there anything else
you might need, ma'am?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.119
Hmm.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.119
The location of the eggs.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.999
You see, this contract
was with Lake Drive.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.919
It was voided the day
Lake Drive closed its doors.

12:28.920 --> 12:32.249
No, sir. This contract required
that you contact our client

12:32.250 --> 12:34.079
if ever you were
to close your doors.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.459
Well, the eggs are gone.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.749
We flushed out the system
when we reopened.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.709
Then you can expect our filing.

12:40.710 --> 12:43.749
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wai...
We did nothing wrong here.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.079
You're welcome to sue
Lake Drive, but not us.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.329
No, we will be suing you,
personally, Doctor.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.919
You are in charge of a clinic

12:50.920 --> 12:54.539
with the same facilities
and same director?

12:54.540 --> 12:57.119
My guess is you don't want
the secretary of state's office

12:57.120 --> 13:00.080
looking closely
into a fraudulent transfer.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.119
Okay, hold on.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.000
(sighs)

13:10.000 --> 13:11.829
Laura?

13:11.830 --> 13:13.919
Salano.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.079
DOCTOR:
Okay.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.079
They were sent
to Chicago Poly-Tech

13:18.080 --> 13:21.039
for humanitarian reasons.

13:21.040 --> 13:25.119
MAN: <i>You're saying the ovum
ended up here by mistake?</i>

13:25.120 --> 13:27.079
Yes, from Lake Drive.
Pardon?

13:27.080 --> 13:29.209
Uh, from Lake Drive Fertility.

13:29.210 --> 13:31.039
It was donated accidentally.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.579
Ah. And you want to
know where they are.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.379
Well, let's see.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.999
Yes, they were transferred to
our stem cell research lab.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.539
Good. Where is that?

13:41.540 --> 13:44.289
(louder): Where is that?
Oh, you won't find
them still there.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.419
No, they've already been
fertilized and D&Ded.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.749
D&Ded?

13:47.750 --> 13:49.080
Yeah, discarded and destroyed.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.749
All 11 of them.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.040
I'm sorry.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.169
Wait, there were 12.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.289
No, 11, there were 11...

13:58.290 --> 13:59.749
No, there were 12 donated.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.620
Where is the 12th egg?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.249
DOCTOR:
Ah, it's marked "confidential."

14:07.250 --> 14:09.039
What? What is?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.249
The egg.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.829
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

14:11.830 --> 14:14.459
Sometimes I find it difficult
to hear myself.

14:14.460 --> 14:15.999
No, I can hear you.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.379
But you're a public
institution, Doctor;

14:17.380 --> 14:19.710
why is it marked confidential?

14:20.920 --> 14:22.380
No, it doesn't look like rain.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.709
So, one of my eggs still exists,
but we don't know where?

14:26.710 --> 14:29.669
Yes, it was listed
as confidential.

14:29.670 --> 14:30.959
But none of the others were?
No.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.999
Why would they keep
one egg hidden?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Patient confidentiality?

14:38.250 --> 14:41.960
Do any of the Poly-Tech
researchers see patients?

14:44.120 --> 14:46.209
I can't tell you.
It's listed as confidential.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.499
Can you at least tell us

14:47.500 --> 14:49.289
which teaching doctors
see patients?

14:49.290 --> 14:50.919
What?

14:50.920 --> 14:53.619
Can you tell us which
doctors see patients?

14:53.620 --> 14:54.919
Oh, thank you,

14:54.920 --> 14:56.789
but it's not lunchtime yet.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.379
Do you know we're
lawyers, Doctor?

14:58.380 --> 15:00.459
DOCTOR:
Pardon?

15:00.460 --> 15:02.540
Do you know that we're lawyers?

15:05.250 --> 15:08.669
Never mind.
Thanks for your help.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.080
October.

15:19.670 --> 15:20.919
The ovum that you have,
Dr. Norwood,

15:20.920 --> 15:24.499
it belongs to our client,
and she wants it back.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.669
What's your evidence of that?

15:26.670 --> 15:27.919
This contract.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.749
This acknowledgement of
the transfer of 12 eggs

15:29.750 --> 15:30.959
from Lake Drive.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.879
The Genome labs acknowledgement

15:32.880 --> 15:34.879
that they transferred
one egg to you.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.789
And why do you want the ovum?

15:36.790 --> 15:38.999
She needs her egg back
to fertilize it.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.289
Regrettably,
here's the problem...

15:40.290 --> 15:42.119
You've already destroyed it?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.880
No, we've already fertilized it.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.879
TED:
One more smile.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.919
Okay.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.329
One more smile.

15:54.330 --> 15:56.039
Look at Mom.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.289
Just one more smile.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.119
Tell me if you need me
to say anything,

15:59.120 --> 16:00.959
because I could just
stand here being intimidating,

16:00.960 --> 16:02.249
you know, frowning like this.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.879
TED: Great. That's great.
Now, keep smiling.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.880
Look at me. Just turn your head
a little bit to the left.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.040
Just give me a second.
I'll be right back.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.669
What do you want?

16:17.670 --> 16:19.119
I want you to stop harassing me.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.619
I'm not doing anything.

16:20.620 --> 16:23.039
You came into my shop.
Stop pretending, Ted.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.169
It has your photographs,

16:24.170 --> 16:26.119
the photographs
I let you take of me.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.829
You linked them to...
Okay, Maia,

16:27.830 --> 16:29.669
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,

16:29.670 --> 16:31.619
but why don't you
make an appointment...

16:31.620 --> 16:34.079
She wants to talk to you now.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.619
So this is your new girlfriend?

16:36.620 --> 16:37.959
No, but that shouldn't matter.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.039
I mean, I'm not gay,
but I could be.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.789
MAIA:
It's harassment, Ted.

16:41.790 --> 16:44.329
I'm a lawyer, and I could sue
you for everything you have.

16:44.330 --> 16:45.749
(chuckles)
Oh, you mean all of this?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.079
Wow.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.959
It was four years ago.
Get over it.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.749
I am over it; I met someone,

16:50.750 --> 16:52.419
so whatever it is that
you think that I'm doing...

16:52.420 --> 16:53.960
(phone chimes)

16:55.460 --> 16:57.829
You're the only one
who had these photos, Ted.

16:57.830 --> 16:59.539
It's a Twitterbot.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.499
Oh, Jesus.
I got it up and
running two years ago.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.709
It's just getting attention now
because of the Ponzi scheme.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.039
What's a Twitterbot?

17:06.040 --> 17:08.329
It's a program that
imitates a Twitter feed.

17:08.329 --> 17:11.039
That's why the interest
in canning fruit?

17:11.040 --> 17:12.118
It's programed to
take on characteristics

17:12.119 --> 17:13.459
of hobbyists sites.

17:13.460 --> 17:14.829
Adds personality.

17:14.829 --> 17:16.039
Okay, so turn it off.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.919
If you invented this bot,
turn it off.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.540
If I try to kill it,
it'll just duplicate itself.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.959
It's pretending to be me.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.499
So just ignore it.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.079
You're an asshole.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.919
Hey, you're the one
who broke up with me.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.460
Tell your girlfriend to fix it.

17:37.330 --> 17:38.919
It's very adult, Maia...
it's very adult!

17:38.920 --> 17:40.249
Yeah, my girlfriend's
pretty tough.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.540
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

17:47.420 --> 17:49.829
Ms. Lockhart. Ms. Rindell.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.119
Yes?
Yes?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.499
You've been served.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.209
Somebody here for me?
Mr. Boseman.

17:54.210 --> 17:55.499
Yeah?

17:55.500 --> 17:57.039
You've been served.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.079
Come on, you kidding me?

17:58.080 --> 17:59.499
By who?
Kresteva.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.119
And can one of you
point me in the direction

18:01.120 --> 18:03.000
of a Ms. Lucca Quinn?

18:08.290 --> 18:10.170
Good luck with the grand jury.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.169
How long do you want me to say?
20 minutes.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.329
You got a backup.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.499
Got it.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.120
Here they come.

18:31.380 --> 18:32.959
Eight-ouncer, Mike,
extra onions.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.289
How long you got?

18:34.290 --> 18:36.709
Mm, 15.
Judge is not happy.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.419
It'll take 20.
I got a backup.

18:38.420 --> 18:39.499
COLIN:
Oh, come on.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.079
MIKE: Hey, it's
not justice,

18:41.080 --> 18:43.710
it's burgers; they take time.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.669
Extra onions, peppers?

18:49.670 --> 18:50.959
Of course.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.789
Forget it, Mike.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.209
So, what, you've been waiting in
here all day for me to come in?

18:55.210 --> 18:58.079
Yep, your charm is
that irresistible.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.919
You want to know what I think?

18:59.920 --> 19:01.209
Can't wait.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.829
I think you couldn't
wait to see me again,

19:02.830 --> 19:04.669
and that's why the burger's
already cut in half.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.039
(clicks tongue)
You got me.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.999
This is a bad habit, isn't it?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.789
You teasing me,

19:09.790 --> 19:11.669
me grinning
and teasing you back?

19:11.670 --> 19:12.959
It's easy.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.619
As opposed to?

19:14.620 --> 19:16.789
The truth?
(chuckles)

19:16.790 --> 19:18.790
This should be
interesting. Go.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.619
(clears throat)

19:24.620 --> 19:28.379
Last year, I went to
see a, uh, therapist.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.879
Dr. Gilbert.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.879
My problem was that
my relationships never lasted

19:32.880 --> 19:34.619
more than three weeks.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.499
I wanted to know if
the problem was me or them.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.999
Oh, it has to be them.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.879
Well, Dr. Gilbert
said that the ease

19:41.880 --> 19:45.289
of my life had made me
treat things superficially,

19:45.290 --> 19:48.749
and that what I needed to do
was refrain

19:48.750 --> 19:52.039
from the thing
that I loved the most

19:52.040 --> 19:53.829
for a full year.

19:53.830 --> 19:56.079
God, this is such shit.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.209
No, every word I'm telling you
is the truth.
(laughs)

19:58.210 --> 20:01.709
At 8:30 p.m., on March 14th,

20:01.710 --> 20:03.579
the year will be up.

20:03.580 --> 20:05.079
And you're looking for someone

20:05.080 --> 20:07.209
to share this
deep experience with you?

20:07.210 --> 20:08.499
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.419
Laugh if you will,

20:10.420 --> 20:15.419
but I need a woman who is
able to enjoy what I have...

20:15.420 --> 20:16.829
Someone to share your bed with,

20:16.830 --> 20:19.169
someone to show you the
true meaning of love?

20:19.170 --> 20:20.749
No, God, no.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.419
No, I'm looking for someone
to share a milkshake

20:22.420 --> 20:24.499
at Scooter's Frozen Custard.
(chuckles)

20:24.500 --> 20:26.669
No, been a very long, hard year.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.879
God, they are good.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.419
Mm.
Mm.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.789
Sex is transient,
but a Boston Shake...

20:31.790 --> 20:34.669
Okay, am I being invited?

20:34.670 --> 20:36.079
Yeah.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.619
Next Tuesday.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.210
Afterwards we could have sex.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.210
(chuckles)

20:44.670 --> 20:46.669
What's this?

20:46.670 --> 20:48.249
It's a subpoena authorized by

20:48.250 --> 20:51.669
the D.O.J. for
me and my firm.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.709
So is this why
you came in here today?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.039
Yes.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.879
As fascinating as
I find you, Colin,

20:56.880 --> 20:59.209
I need to know what
Mike Kresteva's up to.

20:59.210 --> 21:00.499
This is from Kresteva?

21:00.500 --> 21:01.999
Yeah. Why?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.119
Well, he was just given
the police brutality study.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.459
Yes. So why is he after us?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.539
(inhales sharply)
I don't know.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.669
I'll check it out.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.119
Thanks for the burger.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.499
You're welcome.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.879
You sold me out, Mike.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.209
MARISSA:
<i>Okay, I think I helped here.</i>

21:18.210 --> 21:20.669
With the
Twitter account?
Yeah.

21:20.670 --> 21:23.459
Was that the first time
you ever slapped anyone?

21:23.460 --> 21:25.169
Yeah, I guess it was.

21:25.170 --> 21:26.959
Anyway, I contacted
Twitter and told them

21:26.960 --> 21:28.329
it was a Twitterbot
imitating you,

21:28.330 --> 21:29.919
and they froze it
until they review it.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.419
That's great.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.999
I didn't even realize
you could do that.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.329
I didn't either.

21:34.330 --> 21:35.999
(chuckles)

21:36.000 --> 21:38.539
DIANE: The, uh,
problem, Laura, is...

21:38.540 --> 21:42.379
the last remaining ova
has already been fertilized.

21:42.380 --> 21:43.709
By who?

21:43.710 --> 21:45.209
That's the question.

21:45.210 --> 21:46.999
We don't know.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.169
We located it at
Chicago Poly-Tech,

21:49.170 --> 21:50.999
in the genetics lab,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.879
and we're bringing
them to court.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.919
There might be a good
case here, but...

21:54.920 --> 21:57.329
Do you want to fight it?

21:57.330 --> 22:00.749
Knowing that you won't be able
to choose the genetic father.

22:00.750 --> 22:05.959
Your ova has already been
fertilized by someone.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.420
Someone you may have to fight.

22:12.380 --> 22:15.249
What a load of shit.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.169
Ms. Hoff,
always good to see you.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.459
She really doesn't care
who the father is?

22:18.460 --> 22:20.879
Laura, this should be
between the lawyers.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.379
My guess is you're
representing the family?

22:23.380 --> 22:26.539
Mm, I'm representing the owners
of the fertilized embryo.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.789
No, you're representing
the co-owner

22:27.790 --> 22:29.289
of the fertilized embryo.

22:29.290 --> 22:30.829
We are representing
the other co-owner.

22:30.830 --> 22:32.999
She abandoned ownership
when she sold her eggs.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.209
Contractually,
she retained ownership.

22:35.210 --> 22:36.419
My clients knew nothing
of that contract.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.829
That doesn't negate
that contract.

22:37.830 --> 22:39.539
As far as my clients
are concerned, it does.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.249
Your beef is with whoever
voided the contract...

22:41.250 --> 22:42.669
Everything all right?

22:42.670 --> 22:46.209
Yeah, yeah, I just want
to see who the dad is.

22:46.210 --> 22:48.580
He'll be on the
other side, right?

22:49.830 --> 22:52.379
I think so.

22:52.380 --> 22:54.419
The next person
through those doors

22:54.420 --> 22:57.000
will be the father of my child.

23:01.420 --> 23:02.879
The next <i>male
</i> through those doors

23:02.880 --> 23:04.540
will be the father of my child.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.619
DIANE:
My client is willing to pay

23:07.620 --> 23:09.619
for you to find
another egg donor.
How gracious.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.669
They are happy with this one.
Oh, come on.

23:11.670 --> 23:13.879
They have other opportunities.
She just has this one egg.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.879
Your client can
fertilize a lot of eggs.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.329
And we're willing
to offer $18,500

23:18.330 --> 23:20.459
to pay for another egg donor.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.039
This family has spent years
looking for a donor.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.499
And we will pay

23:23.500 --> 23:24.829
for them to find another.
(door opens)

23:24.830 --> 23:26.750
Why does this one matter?

23:31.960 --> 23:34.079
What do you think?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.539
I think that's the father
to my baby.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.919
LUCCA: Do you want
to keep fighting?

23:39.920 --> 23:42.329
There's a kid I plan to raise
and send to college.

23:42.330 --> 23:44.419
18 years from now,
he or she will be mine.

23:44.420 --> 23:46.289
I don't see anybody else
raising him.

23:46.290 --> 23:47.919
Good. That's what
we need to hear.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.379
MAN:
All rise!

23:49.380 --> 23:51.620
Let's all take our seats please.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.249
I've read your briefs.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.249
I know there's
a lot of passion...

23:57.250 --> 23:59.540

24:04.170 --> 24:06.420
(electronic chiming continues)

24:10.540 --> 24:12.459
Let me see your phone.

24:12.460 --> 24:14.539
It's... it's not
my phone, Your Honor.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.499
It's, uh...
it's this watch.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.959
Let me see it.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.619
Yeah, yeah.
(clears throat)

24:21.620 --> 24:23.329
It's just a... just a...

24:23.330 --> 24:24.330
Hmm.

24:24.331 --> 24:26.749
Oh, sh...
Your Honor?

24:26.750 --> 24:29.209
JUDGE: The, uh,
plaintiff would like

24:29.210 --> 24:32.249
an emergency injunction
against implantation?

24:32.250 --> 24:33.919
Yes, Your Honor. There is some
question about the ownership.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.249
ALMA: The plaintiff
relinquished ownership

24:35.250 --> 24:37.709
when she sold her ova
for $20,000.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.499
LUCCA: No, she has
contractual control

24:39.500 --> 24:40.999
after five years.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.329
My clients knew nothing

24:42.330 --> 24:44.209
about that contract.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.459
If the plaintiff had loaned
her car to a third party,

24:46.460 --> 24:47.999
and that third party
sold the car to us,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.329
the plaintiff's disagreement

24:49.330 --> 24:50.539
is with the third party,
not with us.

24:50.540 --> 24:52.119
DIANE:
It's not a car,

24:52.120 --> 24:53.959
Your Honor, this is an embryo.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.919
An embryo that is co-owned
by two parents.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.419
Not two parents.
That personalizes...

24:58.420 --> 25:00.119
My client's DNA...

25:00.120 --> 25:02.169
JUDGE:
Okay, okay, okay.

25:02.170 --> 25:04.709
I will grant a temporary
injunction against implantation

25:04.710 --> 25:08.249
merely to give both of you time
to present evidence.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.539
Please return tomorrow
ready to...
Your Honor,

25:10.540 --> 25:13.419
my clients have a... trip
planned to England next week.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.379
If this matters to them,
they'll stay.

25:15.380 --> 25:17.209
Adjourned.

25:17.210 --> 25:20.830
Excuse me. Your Honor,
can I have my watch back?

Are you about to get fired?

25:49.460 --> 25:50.999
What?!

25:51.000 --> 25:53.079
There's an article
on <i>AmericanNews </i> insisting

25:53.080 --> 25:55.459
that you are being fired
from your law firm.

25:55.460 --> 25:58.329
What?! No! Wh-Why?

25:58.330 --> 26:00.379
Okay, it says that your
accusations of anti-gay bias

Am I being fired?

26:15.540 --> 26:17.749
I barely even know who you are.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.379
So I'm not?

You're not.

Go.

26:21.501 --> 26:24.000
Thank you.

26:25.460 --> 26:28.079
It's a lie.
I'm not being fired.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.669
I just got a new Google alert.

26:29.670 --> 26:33.169
It says that you just bought
$350,000 in jewelry.

26:33.170 --> 26:35.079
What?!
(quietly): What?!

26:35.080 --> 26:37.209
It's my ex-boyfriend.
He's at it again.

26:37.210 --> 26:40.209
KRESTEVA:
<i>Diane. Hi.</i>

26:40.210 --> 26:41.749
Hello.
Thank you for appearing

26:41.750 --> 26:43.379
in front of
our grand jury today.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.380
No thanks are necessary.

26:44.381 --> 26:45.879
I was subpoenaed.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.169
(chuckles)
I had no choice.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.539
Well, thank you, anyway.

26:50.540 --> 26:52.079
Did I visit
your office yesterday?

26:52.080 --> 26:54.079
You did.
Did I ask you about

26:54.080 --> 26:57.079
police brutality cases
in Chicago?

26:57.080 --> 26:58.419
You did.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.169
And did I ask you
for suggestions

27:00.170 --> 27:01.749
on how to address this issue?

27:01.750 --> 27:03.749
Yes, you did.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.879
And you chose not to answer.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.039
I wasn't certain
of your motives.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.379
My... (chuckles)

27:11.380 --> 27:14.379
What could be wrong
with my motives?

27:14.380 --> 27:16.330
I think you tend to lie.

27:19.380 --> 27:24.249
Your firm makes a lot of money
on these police brutality cases.

27:24.250 --> 27:25.619
Is that a question?

27:25.620 --> 27:28.459
Yeah, it is.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.459
Define "a lot of money."

27:30.460 --> 27:34.379
30% of its annual income.

27:34.380 --> 27:35.829
Well, I'm new to the firm.

27:35.830 --> 27:38.379
I think it's best
that you ask Mr. Boseman.

27:38.380 --> 27:41.669
When I asked <i>you </i> about
your firm's attitude

27:41.670 --> 27:43.249
about police brutality,

27:43.250 --> 27:45.499
did you not say
that the problem was

27:45.500 --> 27:49.250
the people of Cook County
hated African-Americans?

27:55.380 --> 27:56.829
(chuckles)

27:56.830 --> 27:59.329
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

27:59.330 --> 28:02.329
No.

28:02.330 --> 28:05.459
Yes.

28:05.460 --> 28:08.119
When I asked you

28:08.120 --> 28:12.499
if your firm's motives
were pure, did you not say

28:12.500 --> 28:16.539
the problem is that Cook County
hated African-Americans

28:16.540 --> 28:19.539
and treated
black lives carelessly?

28:19.540 --> 28:20.619
No.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.379
You did not say that?

28:22.380 --> 28:23.879
No, I said nothing like it.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.789
Are you saying that my notes
from our meeting are incorrect?

28:26.790 --> 28:29.459
Your notes on our meeting
are bizarrely incorrect.

28:29.460 --> 28:32.579
Well, would you be
kind enough to show me

28:32.580 --> 28:34.580
where I was mistaken?

28:41.080 --> 28:43.329
Well, you came into my office,

28:43.330 --> 28:46.249
you explained the nature
of your task force,

28:46.250 --> 28:48.749
we spoke about your son,
and that was it.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.539
I don't know where
you got this quote,

28:50.540 --> 28:52.329
but there's not
a single word of it

28:52.330 --> 28:54.330
that is accurate.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.460
Really?

29:01.290 --> 29:03.289
And we spoke about my son?

29:03.290 --> 29:05.329
Why would we speak about my son?

29:05.330 --> 29:07.879
I asked you how he was.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.329
My son who died?

29:09.330 --> 29:12.960
You... asked me
how he was?

29:14.960 --> 29:18.330
Yes. I didn't know
that he had passed.

29:25.380 --> 29:28.539
How long was I in your office?

29:28.540 --> 29:31.419
Six minutes, approximately.

29:31.420 --> 29:34.919
And you're saying that I spent
the majority of that time

29:34.920 --> 29:37.499
(chuckles)
talking about my son?

29:37.500 --> 29:38.919
Yes.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.289
Really?

29:40.290 --> 29:41.960
Yes.

29:52.620 --> 29:54.249
He's setting us up.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.920
Why?

29:59.380 --> 30:02.039
He wants to reduce the number
of police brutality cases,

30:02.040 --> 30:04.119
but not by reducing
police brutality...

30:04.120 --> 30:06.919
by reducing the number of cases.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.379
He wants to reduce us?
Uh-huh.

30:08.380 --> 30:09.540
But he can't, can he?

30:11.290 --> 30:14.830
What does your AUSA say?

30:18.250 --> 30:20.879
Yeah, he lies.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.829
Does your boss know that?

30:22.830 --> 30:24.249
Well, everyone lies.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.669
(scoffs)

30:25.670 --> 30:27.619
But Kresteva is lying about us.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.540
He's saying we said things
that we didn't.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.459
All right, here's what I can do.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.459
I could argue your case to
the assistant attorney general,

30:35.460 --> 30:36.919
Wilbur Dincon.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.499
He controls Kresteva's agenda.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.499
You're serious?

30:41.500 --> 30:44.039
(chuckles):
Yeah. Why?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.499
I don't know.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.829
You're being nice.

30:47.830 --> 30:49.329
Well, I'm drinking.

30:49.330 --> 30:50.709
I'm nice when I drink.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.379
Really?
Mm.

30:52.380 --> 30:53.499
I'm mean.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.249
(clears throat)

30:55.250 --> 30:58.420
You want to go back to my place?

31:01.170 --> 31:03.579
No.
Why?

31:03.580 --> 31:05.379
That would make this
seem like a quid pro quo,

31:05.380 --> 31:06.580
and you don't want that.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.579
Why don't I want that?
Because,

31:10.580 --> 31:12.829
for the first time,
you seem like a good guy.

31:12.830 --> 31:16.039
Don't ruin it.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.329
Anyway,

31:17.330 --> 31:20.920
we have a date for a milkshake.

31:24.290 --> 31:26.379
Fuck, I hate being a good guy.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.420
(chuckles)

31:32.790 --> 31:34.459
You may continue.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.379
DIANE:
Thank you, Your Honor.

31:36.380 --> 31:38.789
Dr. Norwood,
let's turn to this embryo.

31:38.790 --> 31:41.289
Oh, um, excuse me, Your Honor.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.829
(quietly): Norwood is going
to England next week, too.

31:43.830 --> 31:44.920
Just like the Haights.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.379
Counselor,

31:49.380 --> 31:51.169
do you have something
more for this witness?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.459
Yes, I do.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.789
Are you traveling to England

31:53.790 --> 31:55.289
next week, Dr. Norwood?

31:55.290 --> 31:56.709
ALMA:
Objection, Your Honor.

31:56.710 --> 31:59.169
Are the doctor's
travel arrangements

31:59.170 --> 32:00.379
really necessary?

32:00.380 --> 32:02.379
I don't know. Are they?

32:02.380 --> 32:04.579
They are, Your Honor.
They are.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.329
Are you going to
England to implant

32:06.330 --> 32:08.290
this embryo into Mrs. Haight?

32:11.080 --> 32:12.619
Yes.
And why in England?

32:12.620 --> 32:14.379
Why not in America?

32:14.380 --> 32:17.039
Well, it's a procedure
that's approved of in England.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.329
So this is a procedure
that is illegal in America?

32:19.330 --> 32:22.119
I wouldn't put it that way.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.789
What way would you put it?

32:23.790 --> 32:26.789
It's not approved of in America.

32:26.790 --> 32:30.289
Okay, well, why don't you
explain this procedure.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.499
NORWOOD: Mrs. Haight
has the genetic marker

32:32.500 --> 32:34.579
for Leigh syndrome.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.879
It's a severe neurological
disorder that results in

32:37.880 --> 32:39.329
the death of the child.

32:39.330 --> 32:40.879
The procedure considered
permissible in England

32:40.880 --> 32:42.999
is called mitochondrial
DNA replacement.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.249
What is that?

32:44.250 --> 32:47.329
And, please, explain
it to me like

32:47.330 --> 32:49.419
I'm an eight-year-old.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.459
Ms. Salano's embryo has

32:51.460 --> 32:54.379
no trace of Leigh's syndrome;
it's clean.

32:54.380 --> 32:57.079
We take genes from that embryo

32:57.080 --> 33:00.579
and place those genes
in a new fertilized egg...

33:00.580 --> 33:02.379
the embryo belonging
to Mrs. Haight.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.289
In that way,
Mrs. Haight has an embryo

33:04.290 --> 33:05.709
without Leigh's syndrome.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.329
What happens with
the first embryo?

33:08.330 --> 33:10.289
That one,
Ms. Salano's embryo,

33:10.290 --> 33:12.669
is used for its genetic
contribution, that's all.

33:12.670 --> 33:14.419
Then it's destroyed?

33:14.420 --> 33:16.289
It's not destroyed.
It's no longer viable.

33:16.290 --> 33:17.789
They don't want my baby.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.209
They just want to use
some of my genes

33:19.210 --> 33:20.249
to make their baby whole?
JUDGE: Please,

33:20.250 --> 33:23.329
ma'am, let your lawyers
ask the questions.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.249
Can you answer her question,
Doctor?

33:25.250 --> 33:27.119
It's not a question
of this baby or that.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.539
Everything is a potentiality
at this point.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.499
The Haights' potential embryo
needs to be made whole

33:31.500 --> 33:34.749
with the genetic material
from this other embryo.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.289
So you would destroy
Laura's chance of creating life

33:36.290 --> 33:38.999
by taking her embryo
and raiding it for its genes?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.749
I don't like the word "raiding."

33:41.750 --> 33:43.879
JUDGE:
Okay, I get it.

33:43.880 --> 33:48.119
We are in some very odd areas
of contract law now.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.499
No, this is about life,
Your Honor.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.539
Actually, no.

33:50.540 --> 33:52.789
The existing embryo is property.

33:52.790 --> 33:54.419
The only question is:

33:54.420 --> 33:56.289
who does it belong to?

33:56.290 --> 33:59.379
Does Ms. Solano own it
or Mr. Haight?

33:59.380 --> 34:02.379
You bring me evidence tomorrow,
and we'll decide.

34:02.380 --> 34:05.620
Oh, God, I hate this.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.329
Okay, so what?

34:15.330 --> 34:19.039
The law firm
Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad

34:19.040 --> 34:20.829
is feeling aggrieved.

34:20.830 --> 34:23.619
They feel like the task force
is unfairly targeting them.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.039
I guess that means me.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.668
WILBUR:
Yeah, I guess it does.

34:26.670 --> 34:28.539
Are you targeting them, Mike?

34:28.540 --> 34:29.829
No, I'm targeting
police brutality.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.879
By targeting the law
firm suing the most?

34:31.880 --> 34:33.708
That's right.
It'll show the greatest progress

34:33.710 --> 34:35.829
for the stats.

34:35.830 --> 34:38.708
I'm not sure what the problem
is here, Colin.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.289
Mike's got a strategy.
He needs to pursue it.

34:41.290 --> 34:44.000
I'm just worried that it's
an all African-American firm.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.708
It's all black?

34:46.710 --> 34:48.619
It's not all black.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.829
Diane Lockhart is Causacian.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.708
It just seems like it would be

34:52.710 --> 34:54.918
a public relations disaster
to go after

34:54.920 --> 34:57.999
an all African-American firm.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.249
Especially to try to curb
police brutality suits.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.119
We're not just after them
for police brutality.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.000
Okay, what else?

35:07.580 --> 35:08.959
I'm developing leads.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.709
Well, develop them fast,

35:10.710 --> 35:12.749
or drop it.

35:12.750 --> 35:13.959
You have a lot juicer targets.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.620
Yes, sir. Thank you.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.880
JAY:
It's fake news.

35:19.881 --> 35:21.539
The articles about me?
Yes.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.379
It's click bait.
People are angry about

35:23.380 --> 35:25.289
your parents' Ponzi scheme,
so there's an audience

35:25.290 --> 35:26.749
for these kind of articles.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.749
It's from my ex-boyfriend?

35:28.750 --> 35:30.119
MARISSA:
Probably from another bot.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.169
It quotes your tweets
about being fired...

35:32.170 --> 35:33.499
Not mine. The fake tweets.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.789
Right. It repackages
those tweets

35:34.790 --> 35:36.079
and quotes them in an article.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.500
So, I mean, how do we stop this?

35:40.210 --> 35:41.999
TED:
What is this?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.209
A T.R.O.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.079
A what?

35:45.080 --> 35:46.499
A temporary restraining order.

35:46.500 --> 35:47.959
By order of
the Cook County Circuit Court,

35:47.960 --> 35:50.079
you must immediately cease
generating false news

35:50.080 --> 35:52.169
about Maia Rindell
until a hearing can be held

35:52.170 --> 35:54.119
on the merits of her case
against you.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.919
You don't know much
about computers, do you?

35:55.920 --> 35:57.789
I know enough.
Cook County Circuit Court

35:57.790 --> 36:00.709
has jurisdiction
only in Illinois.

36:00.710 --> 36:03.749
I bounce my encrypted software
through servers in 20 states,

36:03.750 --> 36:06.379
Mexico and Japan.

36:06.380 --> 36:09.749
Cook County Circuit Court
can't enforce this order.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.460
No jurisdiction.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.879
We've hit the limits
of the legal system.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.039
You're telling me there's
really nothing we can do?

36:19.040 --> 36:21.379
Not legally.
Wait, you trying to tell me

36:21.380 --> 36:23.000
there's something
I can do illegally?

36:24.250 --> 36:25.709
No.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.789
Sounded like that to me.
Me, too.

36:27.790 --> 36:30.669
Okay, look, I can't be a party
to whatever this is.

36:30.670 --> 36:32.420
I have to go.

36:33.710 --> 36:35.210

You want to do the honors?

Son, you got to
take care of this.

It's right here.
That's fake news, Roger.

37:23.290 --> 37:25.499
I don't care what it is;
it was on my Facebook page.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.289
"$45,000 missing
from liquor store."

37:27.290 --> 37:28.789
That doesn't even
make sense... I work here,

37:28.790 --> 37:30.289
I don't work at a liquor store.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.919
But it's your name and
your picture. Look.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.460
Roger, any hacker could
do that; I could do that.

37:35.710 --> 37:37.709
Please don't let me go.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.829
You got to go talk
to the police, Ted.

37:39.830 --> 37:41.880
It says that
they're looking for you.

37:46.380 --> 37:48.379
ALMA: Mr. Haight,
when Dr. Norwood

37:48.380 --> 37:50.249
found this matching embryo,
and you paid for the treatment,

37:50.250 --> 37:51.579
how much did you pay?

37:51.580 --> 37:53.919
All in, $9,000.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.289
And when you paid that amount,

37:55.290 --> 37:57.879
did you have any reason
to believe that that egg

37:57.880 --> 38:00.329
didn't belong to
Chicago Poly-Tech?

38:00.330 --> 38:02.289
No.
Your Honor,

38:02.290 --> 38:05.419
my clients are protected by the
"innocent purchasers" doctrine.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.919
Even if that egg shouldn't have
arrived at Chicago Poly-Tech,

38:07.920 --> 38:10.789
it was purchased legally
and fairly by my clients.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.959
Ms. Lockhart,
how do you respond?

38:12.960 --> 38:14.379
DIANE:
Your Honor,

38:14.380 --> 38:16.579
if my client's car were stolen

38:16.580 --> 38:18.209
and the Haights were asking
your permission...

38:18.210 --> 38:20.209
Oh, dear God.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.709
Counselor, this is not
a stolen car.

38:21.710 --> 38:24.789
At a certain point,
analogy fails us.

38:24.790 --> 38:27.329
I'm disgusted that I have
to use property law

38:27.330 --> 38:29.749
to decide issues of life.

38:29.750 --> 38:30.829
But...

38:30.830 --> 38:35.459
the "innocent purchaser"
doctrine holds.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.829
The embryo belongs
to the Haights.

38:37.830 --> 38:41.420
(whispers):
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.209
(elevator bell dings)

38:50.210 --> 38:51.749
You're ruining my life.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.379
Get out of here, Ted.

38:53.380 --> 38:54.789
I'll call the cops.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.829
Yeah, just try it.
You are such a bitch, Maia.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.170
ADRIAN:
Excuse me.

38:59.620 --> 39:02.919
Is there something
you want to tell us?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.789
This isn't about you.

39:04.790 --> 39:09.079
Actually, if it's about Maia,
it's about me.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.670
Anything else you want to say?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.289
You drop your news articles,
and I'll drop mine.

39:16.290 --> 39:18.330
Okay.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.620
Okay.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.960
Your business is done here.
(elevator bell dings)

39:33.880 --> 39:36.079
Thank you,
Mr. Boseman.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.750
No problem.
(elevator bell dings)

39:45.790 --> 39:48.790
At this firm, we stand up
for each other, Maia.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.079
(liquid pouring)

39:59.080 --> 40:01.710
You all right?

40:08.920 --> 40:11.039
She was pretty inconsolable.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.419
I know.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.290
It's tough.

40:19.710 --> 40:22.580
Do you regret
not having children?

40:26.420 --> 40:28.579
Sometimes.

40:28.580 --> 40:30.249
Not often.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.830
When are the sometimes?

40:35.290 --> 40:37.579
With my husband.

40:37.580 --> 40:40.420
I mean, it's too late
for us now, but, uh...

40:45.380 --> 40:47.419
I look at him
and I wonder what...

40:47.420 --> 40:50.789
you know, what his son
would be like.

40:50.790 --> 40:53.250
Or my daughter.

40:56.790 --> 40:58.329
Yeah. It's interesting.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.579
Most people think
I didn't want kids,

41:00.580 --> 41:03.879
and that's why
I made my work my life.

41:03.880 --> 41:09.119
What they don't realize, it's...
it's really just the opposite.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.329
Yes.
(chuckles softly)

41:11.330 --> 41:12.999
Work.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.079
It's what gives it all meaning.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.750
Hmm.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.749
The only difference is...

41:21.750 --> 41:24.670
kids survive you.

41:26.290 --> 41:29.380
That's not always a good thing.

41:44.420 --> 41:45.790
(sighs softly)

41:57.290 --> 41:59.420
(line ringing)

42:02.460 --> 42:03.460
(ringing stops)

42:03.461 --> 42:05.210
(sets phone on desk)

42:17.460 --> 42:19.460
MARISSA: You all right,
Ms. Lockhart?

42:21.580 --> 42:23.669
England.

42:23.670 --> 42:25.039
(elevator bell dings)

42:25.040 --> 42:27.040
(quiet chatter, phones ringing)

42:34.420 --> 42:37.379
The Human Fertilisation
& Embryology Authority?

42:37.380 --> 42:39.209
Britain's fertility watchdog.

42:39.210 --> 42:41.169
And you called them?
LUCCA: We did.

42:41.170 --> 42:42.289
How?

42:42.290 --> 42:43.669
We dialed 44 and
then the number.

42:43.670 --> 42:45.499
I mean how in the hell
did you manage

42:45.500 --> 42:47.379
to drag them into this?

42:47.380 --> 42:49.119
Different country,
different rules apply.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.919
British law says you can't
sell your eggs for more than

42:51.920 --> 42:53.289
750 pounds.

42:53.290 --> 42:56.169
Laura sold hers for $20,000.

42:56.170 --> 42:59.419
So you just fucked us over.

42:59.420 --> 43:01.999
Under British law, the sale
of these eggs is invalid.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.919
ALMA: What difference does
that make, Your Honor?

43:03.920 --> 43:05.709
You've already ruled on
the ownership of the embryo.

43:05.710 --> 43:07.959
For the express purpose
of taking it to England

43:07.960 --> 43:09.459
for this procedure,
which they have now been

43:09.460 --> 43:10.999
forbidden from doing.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.289
Nicholas Haight,
Courtney Haight, I, uh, take it

43:13.290 --> 43:15.419
that your sojourn to England
is no longer happening?

43:15.420 --> 43:17.249
That is correct, Your Honor.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.789
And what do your clients
want to do with the embryo?

43:19.790 --> 43:21.379
They would like to
have it destroyed.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.329
JUDGE:
Let-let me, uh,

43:23.330 --> 43:28.329
see if I can put this in a way
that you lawyers will like.

43:28.330 --> 43:32.379
Your clients bought
a stolen car,

43:32.380 --> 43:34.379
and now, rather than see it

43:34.380 --> 43:36.209
driven by its rightful owner,

43:36.210 --> 43:40.379
they want to bring it
to the dump and flatten it.

43:40.380 --> 43:42.289
Mr. Haight fertilized the egg.

43:42.290 --> 43:44.789
It's half his.
He doesn't want this child.

43:44.790 --> 43:46.079
LAURA:
But I do,

43:46.080 --> 43:47.379
Your Honor.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.250
JUDGE:
Right.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.959
And there's the rub.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.289
Your clients have no use
for this embryo, Ms. Hoff.

43:53.290 --> 43:55.879
Ms. Salano's only chance

43:55.880 --> 44:00.419
of conceiving a child
is with that same embryo.

44:00.420 --> 44:02.419
So it's hers.

44:02.420 --> 44:04.040
(gavel bangs)

44:06.380 --> 44:08.329
(gasps) Oh!

44:08.330 --> 44:09.669
Thank you.

44:09.670 --> 44:12.079
Oh, my God, thank you.

44:12.080 --> 44:14.379
I did not think that
I was an emotional person,

44:14.380 --> 44:16.249
but look at me.
(chuckles)

44:16.250 --> 44:18.169
It's an emotional thing.

44:18.170 --> 44:19.920
Excuse me.

44:25.750 --> 44:29.289
If I'm able to get pregnant,
I just want you to know

44:29.290 --> 44:30.919
that it will be because of you.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.169
This child is just
as much yours.

44:34.170 --> 44:36.829
So, please, if you want to play
a role in my child's life,

44:36.830 --> 44:39.880
I would do anything
to make that a reality.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.620
This child needs to know love.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.250
Fuck you.

44:51.540 --> 44:53.459
MAIA: Look, he's still
sending them out.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.249
Look, there.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.829
No, it's not him.
Yes, it's him.

44:56.830 --> 44:58.289
I mean, it's the same article.

44:58.290 --> 44:59.709
He said he was gonna
stop, but he hasn't.

44:59.710 --> 45:01.079
No, he has.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.919
These aren't him.
What are you
talking about?

45:02.920 --> 45:04.459
I've been going on Reddit.

45:04.460 --> 45:06.119
They're picking up what
your ex-boyfriend dropped.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.789
You and your family
are not liked there.

45:07.790 --> 45:09.419
Oh, dear God.
Yeah.

45:09.420 --> 45:10.709
Wait, so what do I do?

45:10.710 --> 45:12.119
I mean, these articles
are out there.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.789
They say disgusting things.

45:13.790 --> 45:15.709
It's Reddit; that's, like,
the teeming masses.

45:15.710 --> 45:17.999
You don't do anything.
What, I can't sue?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.119
I can't...
Uh, here's what you do:

45:20.120 --> 45:21.789
You want to know?

45:21.790 --> 45:23.419
You let it go.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.249
Oh, no, I...
No, seriously.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.999
You have to let it go,
ignore it,

45:27.000 --> 45:28.329
push it out of your mind.

45:28.330 --> 45:31.499
The people who know you,
know you.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.169
And they know
you wouldn't do this.

45:33.170 --> 45:35.209
Come on, you have to trust that.

45:35.210 --> 45:37.419
