<i>Listing: New York.</i>

00:05.171 --> 00:07.240
(man)
We're not really up
for negotiating too much.

00:07.273 --> 00:08.508
We would like to get 3.5.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.343
3.5 million is too high.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.112
- 4.5?
- Yes.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.547
In cash?
- Yes.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.548
Yes!

00:15.582 --> 00:17.217
Ooh.
Oh, we love you.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.285
Raising the price would be
the death for it right now.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.921
I'm the client, and I don't
appreciate you being so rude.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.057
(Jordan)
Cheryl terminates us.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.258
Oh, my God.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.961
I'd like us to take
the next step...

00:27.994 --> 00:29.696
So we're gonna have
a baby.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.698
[sobbing]

00:31.731 --> 00:34.734
[upbeat music]

00:34.768 --> 00:36.369
(Ryan)
My motto is expansion...

00:36.403 --> 00:39.739
always in all ways.

00:39.773 --> 00:43.043
(Luis)
New York City, it's the most
exciting city for real estate,

00:43.076 --> 00:44.477
and that's why I'm here.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.479
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

00:46.513 --> 00:49.015
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.150
Wah!

00:50.183 --> 00:51.918
- I will break your teeth.
- Reach high.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.219
Can you take this guy
out of here?

00:53.253 --> 00:54.688
- Are you serious?
- You're not trying to help me.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.222
- What?
- You want to control me.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.599
- Roni.
- Yes.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.903
I'm walking to Joneses'
office as we speak.

01:09.936 --> 01:10.970
I will.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.439
My current listing
with the Joneses,

01:12.472 --> 01:16.076
it's a beautiful
corner townhouse in Harlem.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.878
It's 7,500 square feet,
10 bedrooms,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.380
6 bathrooms.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.082
The problem is the location.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.550
147 is too far north.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.152
You can get downtown
in literally 5, 15 minutes.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.788
(Luis)
It's been very tough to get
people up there at this price.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.527
But the people that have come,
they love it.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.297
(woman)
I have a client
that I think would be

01:37.330 --> 01:39.799
very interested
in this house.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.103
(Luis)
Between the open house and all
the showings we did after,

01:43.103 --> 01:44.738
we ended up with
multiple offers.

01:44.771 --> 01:48.375
Not one.
Multiple.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.411
Unfortunately,
it's not the numbers

01:51.444 --> 01:53.847
that the Joneses want to hear.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.715
One at 3 million
and one at 3.1.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.757
(Luis)
So today I am coming to discuss
new offers.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.291
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.227
Can you tell the doctor
that I come bearing gifts?

02:07.260 --> 02:08.528
Sure.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.463
(Luis)
Dr. Jones is a very busy
plastic surgeon,

02:10.497 --> 02:12.365
so I'm not gonna wait for him
to leave the office.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.100
I'm going to go tell him
the news right now,

02:14.134 --> 02:15.802
whether he's in the middle
of surgery,

02:15.835 --> 02:19.139
butt implants,
cock augmentation,

02:19.172 --> 02:20.240
I don't give a f....

02:20.273 --> 02:22.642
I am presenting,
because I'm presenting.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.643
How are you, sir?

02:23.677 --> 02:25.078
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.280
- So what do you have for us?
- So I have three offers.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.581
- Whoa.
- Yes.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.216
All right,
so the first one is 3.1.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.185
I'm not gonna take that.

02:32.218 --> 02:36.556
The second one,
$3,250,000, which is great.

02:36.589 --> 02:37.557
It's amazing.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.793
But we're not gonna take it.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.095
(Luis)
I generally thought
that $3,250,00

02:42.095 --> 02:46.132
was the highest offer we were
going to get, truly,

02:46.166 --> 02:49.269
but the most amazing thing
happened.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.670
I got an offer,
a full ask.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.138
- Serious?
- Swear to God.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.274
(Luis)
Ronita tells me
that your buyer has submitted

02:54.307 --> 02:56.509
an offer of 3.5.

02:59.946 --> 03:03.583
Okay, this is the one
that we're gonna take.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.188
$3,510,000.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.622
3.5.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.358
- [laughs]
- Very nice.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.226
Over ask.
Boom.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.561
All right,
so we're gonna take it.

03:14.594 --> 03:15.729
We're gonna wrap it up.
We're gonna dance.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.365
We're gonna celebrate.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.567
I'm not gonna look a gift horse
in the mouth.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.735
We'll take it.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.503
- I am so happy.
- So you're excited.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.971
So you're ready to move
to Harlem now.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.773
Yes--uh, yes, maybe.

03:26.806 --> 03:27.874
Not yet,
no.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.075
[laughs]

03:29.075 --> 03:30.443
We're happy that you are
our broker.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.678
I am happy that I am
your broker,

03:31.711 --> 03:33.113
and I'm happy that you are
my client,

03:33.146 --> 03:34.547
and I'm happy that you are
my friend.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.782
It's one big happy family.

03:35.815 --> 03:36.783
You gonna take us
to Puerto Rico again?

03:36.816 --> 03:38.818
(Luis)
Yes, please, on me.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.861
(Fredrik)
Great job on the kitchen,

03:47.894 --> 03:49.963
but I'm already seeing
the challenges

03:49.996 --> 03:51.531
with this unfurnished room.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.901
My current project is at
138 West 19th Street in Chelsea.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.739
When I moved to Chelsea
12 years ago,

03:59.773 --> 04:01.608
it was not the same Chelsea.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.677
It was actually
kind of dangerous.

04:03.710 --> 04:07.914
Now it is really expensive,
fancy, family, kids, parks.

04:07.947 --> 04:10.216
This is gorgeous.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.718
- Hello.
- Oh, there he is.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.186
- Hey.
- Hey, good to see you.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.721
This is Erez.
This is Ryan.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.190
- Nice to meet you, Ryan.
- Ryan Serhant.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.326
Wow, same height.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.496
We do?

04:23.530 --> 04:24.831
Yeah.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.967
No.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.871
(Fredrik)
There's no secret that Ryan
and I have a rocky past.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.808
Yes, but at the same time,
I've always been kind of curious

04:34.841 --> 04:36.843
to see what him and I
could do together.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.979
If we joined forces instead of
undermining each other,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.915
we could actually do
great things.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.351
I have a project
on 19th Street.

04:44.384 --> 04:45.652
Yeah, let's do it.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.253
I'm looking forward.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.790
Besides, it's never good
to have enemies out there.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.992
It's, like, you have to learn
to work with other people.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.095
I'm willing to take the risk
with him.

04:55.095 --> 04:58.565
So I asked him if he wanted to
work with me on the penthouse.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.600
Brokers usually don't get along
with each other,

05:00.633 --> 05:01.701
especially two firms.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.470
(Fredrik)
What?
I get along with everyone.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.938
I've never had a fight
with anyone.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.075
- Why are you smiling?
- Exactly.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.310
- So nice to meet you, Ryan.
- Good to meet you.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.444
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.213
- Thank you, Fredrik.
- Thank you.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.214
Bye-bye.
See you.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.548
Okay,
let me show you around.

05:16.616 --> 05:20.353
138th West 19th
is a 5-unit building,

05:20.387 --> 05:23.423
and it really has
3 different products within it.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.127
First a garden apartment
at the bottom,

05:27.160 --> 05:30.497
then in the middle
three 1-bedrooms.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.867
I like the confidence.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.168
Ryan is right.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.936
My developer Erez
smartly priced

05:36.970 --> 05:38.571
the lower floor units
competitively,

05:38.605 --> 05:43.710
around $1,600 to $1,700 a foot,
but the penthouse, whoo.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.446
It is expensive.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.748
I mean, $2,500 a foot.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.917
We're gonna really--
and I mean really--

05:50.950 --> 05:52.686
have to be on our game
to sell this one.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.088
The penthouse is gorgeous,
higher ceilings,

05:55.121 --> 05:57.891
2 bedrooms,
2 full baths,

05:57.924 --> 05:59.859
these finishes with a big,
freestanding tub.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.394
(Ryan)
This is all very, very classic.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.495
- This is beautiful.
- Yeah.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.731
Plus, the best part,
the entire roof.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.567
This is pretty amazing.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.202
Look at this roof.
It's huge.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.603
- This sells the penthouse.
- Yeah.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.106
(Fredrik)
Co-exclusives are done
all the time.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.408
That said,
when you're doing a co-exclusive

06:15.442 --> 06:17.143
between two different firms,

06:17.177 --> 06:19.045
it can be a little bit
more complicated,

06:19.079 --> 06:21.681
even more so when you're dealing
with new development.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.949
Should do a projector,

06:23.049 --> 06:24.718
and this could be
an outdoor screening area.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.753
No, I think it's more, like,
an outdoor dining area.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.689
So there's some paperwork left
to work out

06:29.723 --> 06:33.059
before I can officially bring
Ryan on as a co-exclusive agent.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.894
But honestly,
it's kind of nice,

06:34.928 --> 06:37.931
'cause it give me and Ryan
more time to figure out

06:37.964 --> 06:40.533
if this is actually gonna work
between us.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.268
This is my vision
for the staging.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.838
I think we should go,
like, bachelor...

06:44.871 --> 06:46.139
What?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.409
You know, esque,

06:49.442 --> 06:52.545
like, a little bit of
rock and roll,

06:52.579 --> 06:55.382
maybe some fur, lots of mirrors
to reflect that light.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.649
Did you say fur?

06:56.683 --> 06:59.085
Fake fur, because I don't
believe in real fur.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.354
Do you have fur
in your apartment?

07:03.189 --> 07:04.691
[dog whining]

07:04.724 --> 07:06.226
Let's just keep it simple
and classic.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.727
Um--

07:07.761 --> 07:09.596
We want a single guy
and a family

07:09.629 --> 07:11.398
to want to buy this apartment
at the same time.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.066
Keep it neutral.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.068
When staging a home,

07:15.101 --> 07:17.504
you add too many
personal touches to it,

07:17.537 --> 07:18.672
and you might get lucky.

07:18.705 --> 07:19.906
Someone could come in and say,

07:19.939 --> 07:21.741
"How did you know I liked fur
and mirrors?"

07:21.775 --> 07:23.576
But it's probably not
gonna happen.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.412
I'm just thinking about
the masses.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.747
(Fredrik)
What kind of strategy is that?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.949
A super-agent knows
when to be specific.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.620
You zero in on that buyer.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.289
Pull him or her in,
young, handsome, like myself,

07:36.322 --> 07:37.691
a bachelor.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.359
I'm not a bachelor.
That's a bad bite.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.161
What do you think about
the color of the floor?

07:41.194 --> 07:44.264
I had him agree to stain it
any color we want.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.199
The obvious here, of course,
because of the light

07:46.232 --> 07:50.070
and all the glass is dark

07:50.070 --> 07:53.506
(Ryan)
These are the moments I realize
how much older you are than me.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.375
That's very, very,
very 1990s.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.444
It feels luxurious.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.846
(Ryan)
Ordinarily, I wouldn't waste
my time on a co-list

07:59.879 --> 08:01.548
until it was officially secured,

08:01.581 --> 08:05.251
but I am assuming
that the contracts

08:05.285 --> 08:07.020
are just a formality
at this point.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.789
I love our
brainstorming situation

08:09.823 --> 08:11.157
that's happening
right now.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.427
It seems like Fredrik is
extending an olive branch to me,

08:14.461 --> 08:17.030
which is fine,
and I'll bite.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.865
I mean, I like olives
at the end of the day.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.533
I mean, look at Emilia.
She's Greek.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.168
She's from a place
full of olives.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.641
Because you have an opinion;
I have an opinion.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.909
The stager maybe decides.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.380
Okay.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.084
(Fredrik)
By they way, do you guys think
it would be nice to have dinner,

08:38.118 --> 08:41.221
like, Emilia, Derek, you,
and I one of these nights?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.622
I mean,
that's what colleagues do.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.491
Yeah, let's do it.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.833
[telephone rings]

08:53.867 --> 08:54.834
(Luis)
Roni, talk to me.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.437
- Luis.
- Yes.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.444
What happened?

09:06.746 --> 09:10.917
(Luis)
Which broker?

09:11.017 --> 09:13.186
Speak.

09:15.755 --> 09:20.393
Are you f... kidding me?

09:20.427 --> 09:22.028
The deal has already been
accepted.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.329
It is going through.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.900
F***.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.068
I'm gonna call him right now.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.136
I'll call you right back.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.273
[line trilling]

09:33.306 --> 09:35.108
Pick up, motherf***er.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.610
[line trilling]

09:37.644 --> 09:39.112
[female electronic voice]
Your call has been forwarded

09:39.145 --> 09:41.281
to an automatic
voice message system.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.883
Answer the f***ing phone.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.618
John,
this is Luis Ortiz.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.820
Call me back immediately.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.590
Answer!

09:50.623 --> 09:52.692
Oh, my God.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.663
(man)
Coming up...

09:56.696 --> 09:57.764
We're supposed to do this
together.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.332
Sure, so you can't
come inside and say,

09:59.366 --> 10:00.667
"Hey, this is what
we're gonna do.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.937
This is what we're gonna do."

10:03.970 --> 10:06.272
(Luis)
Well, there's a problem
with the offer.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.117
(Luis)
Good evening.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.351
Table for three.
Ortiz.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.388
Sure.
Follow me.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.856
I'm a dead man walking.

10:22.889 --> 10:26.960
I honestly thought that the
Joneses were asking too much

10:26.993 --> 10:28.895
given the location
of the townhouse,

10:28.928 --> 10:32.065
so this offer,
it seemed too good to be true,

10:32.098 --> 10:33.266
and it was.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.834
Can I get you started
with a glass of wine

10:34.868 --> 10:36.069
or your favorite cocktail?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.071
I'm gonna have a glass
of Scotch neat.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.773
- Okay.
- I'm gonna need one.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.408
And then we'll wait for them
to come here.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.009
All right.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.411
You know what?
Make it a bottle.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.012
- Okay, sounds good.
- Thank you so much.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.050
The Joneses will be here
any minute,

10:50.083 --> 10:54.054
and they have no idea that
we're not here to celebrate.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.488
Hello.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.990
Good to see you.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.793
- Good to see you.
- muah!

10:59.826 --> 11:02.062
[exhales]

11:05.365 --> 11:07.467
Well, yes, yes,
let's get some drinks.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.369
I'm drinking Scotch,
so your drink would be?

11:09.402 --> 11:13.273
Listen,
I'll take a Scotch on the rocks.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.176
Keep the drinks coming,
please.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.878
How about you guys?
Everything good?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.814
Loving life,
and...

11:27.087 --> 11:29.322
[exhales]

11:36.930 --> 11:39.165
I don't know how I'm gonna
tell them this.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.102
(woman)
Cheers.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.105
(man)
Cheers.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.106
<i>Salud.</i>

11:46.139 --> 11:47.774
(man)
<i>Salud.</i>

11:47.807 --> 11:49.209
(woman)
We told you it would happen.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.111
We had faith in you.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.815
There's a problem
with the offer.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.320
The buyers, I think,
got too excited,

12:00.353 --> 12:03.123
and they overextended
themselves.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.192
Yes.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.632
for the price
that they offered us.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.336
The good thing is
that we still have

12:16.369 --> 12:17.804
two very good offers
on the table.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.576
(woman)
3.25 when we had
nothing else

12:23.610 --> 12:25.178
was a consideration.

12:25.211 --> 12:29.182
(man)
But we're not gonna sell
for anything less than 3.5.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.383
There's just no way,
Luis,

12:30.417 --> 12:33.453
that we can leave $1/4 million
on the table.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.155
I want to try to get into
a scenario where

12:35.188 --> 12:37.791
that $3.5 million offer
never existed.

12:37.824 --> 12:38.792
I know it's very hard.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.160
We can't make it go away.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.630
We have to.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.467
We have no choice.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.736
Listen, I understand exactly
where they're coming from.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.970
It's like winning the lottery

12:51.004 --> 12:52.405
and then finding out
that it's fake.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.108
The buyers offered to pay
the Joneses money

12:55.108 --> 12:56.843
that they didn't have.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.479
No matter how long this house
stays on the market,

12:59.512 --> 13:01.815
I don't think it's going to sell
for 3.5.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.383
(man)
You came back and said,

13:03.416 --> 13:05.418
"Listen,
it's probably only worth 3,"

13:05.452 --> 13:07.620
and we compromised
because of our relationship

13:07.654 --> 13:10.056
and said,
"Okay, we'll settle at 3.5."

13:10.056 --> 13:12.625
(woman)
So to let this place go for
anything less than what we want

13:12.659 --> 13:14.661
just really isn't worth it
to us.

13:19.833 --> 13:24.237
(man)
Luis, if you want to walk away
from this

13:24.270 --> 13:26.740
and no longer represent
this house,

13:26.773 --> 13:29.075
we understand that you have done
a tremendous job.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.949
Listen.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.959
(Luis)
When sellers insist on sticking
to a price that's too high,

13:45.992 --> 13:48.094
it can take a long time
to sell that property.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.097
That can put a lot of stress

13:51.097 --> 13:52.532
between the seller
and the broker.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.339
(Luis)
At this point, the Joneses
are not just my clients.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.274
They are my friends.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.877
Friendship is always
more important than business.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.049
I just don't want
the situation when

14:09.049 --> 14:10.617
of things don't happen that way,

14:10.650 --> 14:12.285
and you never end up getting
the 3.5,

14:12.318 --> 14:14.888
and then we've put ourselves
in a position

14:14.921 --> 14:17.390
that it's much less
that I didn't do my job right.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.894
Worst-case scenario,
we are always gonna be friends.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.228
(man)
And we respect you.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.664
You'll still take us
salsa dancing in Puerto Rico.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.766
And everything will be cool.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.371
(woman)
It just wasn't meant to be
this time.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.750
(Ryan)
Hello, hello, hello.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.185
Hi.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.454
- [exhales]
- You look like you're sweating.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.988
- Hello.
- I'm Ryan.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.457
(Fredrik)
Prior to this meeting,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.659
Ryan and I independently
sent our ideas

14:52.692 --> 14:54.160
to my top stager, Will.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.496
I also sent the floor plans
and the photos of the property,

14:56.529 --> 14:59.699
but Will, my stager,
wanted to meet in the apartment

14:59.733 --> 15:02.936
to hear Ryan and me pitch him
our vision.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.472
So I was just explaining
our vision

15:05.505 --> 15:08.041
that you and I discussed
with making it just, like,

15:08.041 --> 15:10.210
a real bachelor apartment.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.578
We're gonna have fur,
mirrors.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.813
Uh, I don't remember
agreeing to that.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.117
(Will)
Who do you think is gonna buy
this apartment?

15:17.150 --> 15:20.153
(Ryan)
I want to be able to bring
everybody through here.

15:20.186 --> 15:24.324
You have to be
somewhat specific, right?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.825
(Ryan)
It's kind of like a trial.

15:25.859 --> 15:26.893
He presents his case.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.062
Definitely want, like,
dark floors.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.063
Then I present mine.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.398
I really like the light floors.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.734
And a jury can't help
but be persuaded by the smarter,

15:34.768 --> 15:36.770
better-looking lawyer.

15:36.803 --> 15:40.674
(Fredrik)
So the master...
we don't have enough closets,

15:40.707 --> 15:44.110
so my idea:
we'll do a Sheetrock wall here.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.880
And this entire thing
becomes a dressing area.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.083
Shh, big paintings.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.919
This is a collaboration, right?
And that's a solution.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.221
Absolutely not
in the middle of a sentence.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.457
We're supposed to
do this together, so you can't--

15:57.490 --> 15:58.992
Sure, so you can't
come inside and say,

15:59.092 --> 16:00.326
"Hey, this is what
we're gonna do.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.661
This is what we're gonna do."

16:01.695 --> 16:02.762
It's, like, the opposite.
I'm saying colors.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.097
What do you mean?
No, I'm saying--

16:04.130 --> 16:05.532
Guys, guys, guys.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.801
And just compromise, compromise.
That's all I'm saying.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.369
(Will)
Let's take it easy for a second.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.571
(Fredrik)
He's, like,
actually being disrespectful.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.239
I mean,
I brought him on to the project.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.441
(Ryan)
I haven't signed any paperwork.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.909
I don't have
an exclusive agreement.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.044
So right now,
I'm kind of working

16:18.044 --> 16:21.514
and giving ideas pro bono.

16:21.548 --> 16:26.453
Okay, Will, clearly we don't
agree on most things, so...

16:28.221 --> 16:30.590
And I'm curious to hear
your thoughts.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.793
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.296
I think we're gonna keep
the floors as they are.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.064
Ryan wins on the floors.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.065
Yes.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.301
1-0.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.136
I'm fine with it if that's
what you want to do.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.139
I wonder what's going on
inside Fredrik's head right now.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.675
I wonder if he's like,
"Oh, my God.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.343
"Is Ryan smarter than me?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.379
"Is Ryan a better broker
than me?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.147
Oh, no."

16:54.180 --> 16:57.350
All right, Fredrik,

16:57.384 --> 17:00.020
we're gonna take
your sexy bachelor look.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.721
Whoo!

17:01.755 --> 17:03.323
- So you like fur?
- I like fur.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.526
- Look how beautiful that looks.
- Sure.

17:06.559 --> 17:10.030
Look, already I can see it
all coming together.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.197
(Ryan)
Is this thing rigged?

17:11.231 --> 17:14.467
Is this, like,
a secret Swedish judge?

17:16.703 --> 17:17.671
Sure.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.040
So in the master...

17:22.142 --> 17:24.811
No closet, no closet,
no closet, no closet.

17:24.844 --> 17:25.845
Please, no closet.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.280
(Will)
Are you ready?

17:32.852 --> 17:36.089
Fredrik...

17:38.692 --> 17:39.759
Yes.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.461
It would be inappropriate
for me to gloat

17:41.494 --> 17:43.396
in front of Fredrik
and the stager,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.132
so I'm gonna do it now.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.234
I won, bitches.

17:48.268 --> 17:52.305
I'm gonna say right now--
I'm gonna say it.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.807
I hope he doesn't hear me.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.811
I can agree that Ryan had
some okay ideas.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.347
Okay, cool.
I think we're good.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.215
Awesome.
Thank you.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.516
So then...
it's gonna be good.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.584
Yeah, let's do it.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.187
- Awesome.
- Cool, cool.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.188
(Ryan)
Coming up...

18:08.221 --> 18:09.689
This is gonna be the deal.

18:09.723 --> 18:11.858
You've got to do five shots
of tequila with me right now.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.560
(Ryan) Five shots of tequila
will kill me.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.344
(Fredrik)
Sometimes I like to do business
outside the office,

18:31.378 --> 18:34.147
and I've always dreamt
of the day that I was gonna be

18:34.180 --> 18:38.618
powerful enough
to summon my assistant...

18:38.651 --> 18:40.053
to the hair salon.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.755
So I need your signature...

18:41.788 --> 18:43.723
- Okay,
- On some checks.

18:43.757 --> 18:45.692
Is it checks
that I'm depositing or--

18:45.725 --> 18:48.962
It's checks that you're
paying out.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.163
But by paying out these checks,

18:50.196 --> 18:51.564
we can continue
to do business.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.899
Your hair looks nice.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.768
$138,000?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.971
No, that's $138.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.206
Anyway, I need that contract
with Ryan done.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.342
It's a new relationship.
It's a new friendship.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.476
What's the problem, Jordan,
honestly?

19:03.510 --> 19:04.477
It's with the attorneys.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.912
The attorneys are working
this out.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.347
He's been bugging me.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.682
He's been sending emails
asking me, Why isn't it"--

19:08.715 --> 19:09.783
No,
it's not for him to do.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.185
It's not, like,
a normal exclusive...

19:12.218 --> 19:13.720
(Fredrik)
The contract has been
with the attorneys

19:13.753 --> 19:15.021
for a couple of weeks,

19:15.021 --> 19:17.023
and it's a little longer
than I wished for.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.893
It's starting to make me
a little bit nervous.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.227
You know where him and I
came from.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.562
I don't want, like,
him to think

19:22.595 --> 19:24.064
that I'm not trying
to make it work.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.033
All that we have to do is let
the attorneys from the firms

19:27.067 --> 19:28.134
work it out.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.336
Ryan should understand that.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.537
If Ryan is as--

19:30.570 --> 19:31.938
Professional?

19:32.038 --> 19:33.073
Right.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.143
I'm gonna call him.
Hold on one second.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.045
[line trilling]

19:39.045 --> 19:40.347
Hi, is this Ryan?

19:41.414 --> 19:43.183
Oh,
you speak exactly like Ryan.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.419
Yes,
please tell him that--

19:46.453 --> 19:48.688
this is Fredrik Eklund
at Douglas Elliman.

19:48.722 --> 19:49.956
I'm with my assistant,
Jordan,

19:50.056 --> 19:51.491
and we're discussing
this contract,

19:51.524 --> 19:54.194
which is very close
to being wrapped up.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.429
Has he left for the day?

19:56.463 --> 19:57.697
Is he home already?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.267
Oh, well, tell him to call me
later tonight.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.436
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.704
See,
this is what I'm saying.

20:04.738 --> 20:05.739
- What?
- Wrap it up.

20:05.772 --> 20:09.376
On that note,
you need a haircut.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.685
I'm looking for Arty.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.153
Right this way.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.288
(Ryan)
Obviously,
I'm hoping that the co-listing

20:22.322 --> 20:23.656
with Fredrik works out,

20:23.690 --> 20:26.326
but I'm definitely not placing

20:26.359 --> 20:29.629
all of my eggs
in the Eklund basket.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.965
what do you call a girl
who doesn't give a blow job?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.299
You don't call her.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.670
[laughter]

20:36.703 --> 20:37.737
Hi.

20:37.771 --> 20:39.172
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey, what's going on?

20:39.205 --> 20:40.774
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.976
I was recently referred to
a buyer named Arty,

20:43.009 --> 20:46.980
not to be confused with R.D.,
my assistant.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.749
This is a very Russian Arty.

20:49.783 --> 20:51.251
This is the family.
Meet everybody.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.852
- Katarina.
- Hi.

20:52.886 --> 20:56.022
You've got to meet Valeria,
Guyta, Racia, Michelle...

20:56.056 --> 20:57.057
Got it.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.591
Sonya, Val.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.859
[laughter]

20:59.893 --> 21:01.661
(Ryan)
Who are these girls?

21:01.695 --> 21:02.662
(Arty)
The family.

21:02.696 --> 21:03.830
I'm gonna remember that.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.065
- [laughs]
- Good to meet you.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.167
- Yeah, I'll test you later.
- Okay, great.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.904
This guys wants to get
$20 million out of Russia

21:10.937 --> 21:14.407
and invested into luxury
property in New York City,

21:14.441 --> 21:16.810
which is bad for Russia

21:16.843 --> 21:18.578
but good for Ryan.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.913
How long have you been
in the city?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.348
I've been here
about 20 years.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.384
You know, have fun.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.652
And what's your main business?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.620
I'm in the liquor business.
These are my brands.

21:27.654 --> 21:28.922
This is gonna be the deal.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.623
I want to see if you're cool.

21:32.125 --> 21:36.196
You've got to do five shots
of tequila with me right now.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.731
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.432
(Ryan)
Five shots of tequila
will kill me.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.368
[laughter]

21:41.401 --> 21:44.337
This is not
the average situation.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.106
But in New York,

21:46.139 --> 21:47.907
you cannot judge a book
by its cover.

21:47.941 --> 21:49.542
I mean,
I've sold $20 million apartments

21:49.576 --> 21:52.345
to people I could have sworn
were homeless,

21:52.379 --> 21:55.548
so who am I to judge?

21:55.582 --> 21:56.616
All right, let's do it.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.819
There's one.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.289
There's two.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.290
(woman)
Whoo.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.260
[laughter]

22:07.293 --> 22:08.895
[coughs]

22:09.929 --> 22:13.700
[laughter]

22:15.568 --> 22:17.070
(Arty)
It's going down good.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.071
Oh, yeah.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.807
This is a $20 million deal.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.808
[exhales]

22:21.841 --> 22:24.444
We do this all day long.
Don't worry.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.578
Ooh.

22:25.612 --> 22:28.415
I would drink motor oil
to get this deal.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.482
Let's do this.
Four.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.087
Let's do this, Ryan,
a new member of the family.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.088
[cheers and applause]

22:35.088 --> 22:36.956
You did it.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.458
Congratulations.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.893
(Ryan voice-over)
Yes.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.494
I think we can definitely
work together.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.729
I got the job.

22:43.897 --> 22:45.432
At least I think I got the job.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.534
Everything is just
a little bit blurry.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.302
I'm just gonna sit here
for a second.

22:49.336 --> 22:52.605
[laughter]

22:58.278 --> 23:00.080
(Luis)
Yeah, send her up.
I'm in the roof.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.081
Send her up.

23:01.114 --> 23:04.484
[door buzzes]

23:04.517 --> 23:07.754
To me, it is extremely difficult
to disappoint any client,

23:07.787 --> 23:10.423
but the ones
that I do care about

23:10.457 --> 23:12.759
destroys everything I have.

23:12.792 --> 23:16.196
Nights like tonight,
they're very sad.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.399
There's nothing that I would
want more in this world

23:19.432 --> 23:23.203
than to have someone
to share those stories with.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.474
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.109
Right now,
I don't have that person.

23:29.142 --> 23:30.510
How are you?

23:30.543 --> 23:33.747
Lisanne is a very beautiful girl
that I met at a restaurant.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.515
She used to be the manager.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.783
Vino?

23:36.816 --> 23:37.984
Please.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.754
And this is the first time
in a long time

23:40.787 --> 23:43.757
that I am seeing a person
with different clothes,

23:43.790 --> 23:45.825
meaning twice.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.093
<i>Salud.</i>

23:47.093 --> 23:48.395
Ahh.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.496
You look beautiful.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.097
Your eyes are amazing.

23:51.131 --> 23:52.499
Stop, 'cause then I get all,
like--

23:52.532 --> 23:54.567
No, I'm not flirting.
I'm just pointing things out.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.138
[laughs]

24:01.174 --> 24:02.342
You're too far from me.

24:03.343 --> 24:04.744
Why don't you come here?

24:04.778 --> 24:06.112
- You know what?
- Can you?

24:06.146 --> 24:08.314
I will do that.

24:08.348 --> 24:11.251
(Luis)
Lisanne is very beautiful,

24:11.284 --> 24:14.187
but I have a hard time
committing to someone,

24:14.220 --> 24:17.390
because there is this specific
energy and fire that I have

24:17.424 --> 24:19.959
that I like when I am by myself.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.662
After work every day,
I come home very late,

24:22.696 --> 24:24.297
11:00,
12:00 at night,

24:24.330 --> 24:26.766
and I drink one glass
of wine.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.069
I'm afraid of a relationship
that could potentially have

24:29.069 --> 24:32.839
the power of destroying
my candle or my fire.

24:32.872 --> 24:33.940
Can I see this?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.542
Oh, no.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.744
Let me see.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.512
It's so old.

24:41.715 --> 24:43.216
I thought it said
"Bleecker Street."

24:43.249 --> 24:44.951
[laughter]

24:44.984 --> 24:46.653
I'm looking
at this girl's wrist,

24:46.686 --> 24:49.689
and I'm reading it like it was
the motherf***ing MLS.

24:49.723 --> 24:51.791
"It says 'Blessed,' Luis.'"

24:51.825 --> 24:52.992
[laughs]

24:53.093 --> 24:54.461
Why are you single?

24:54.494 --> 24:55.628
Why?
Why are you single?

24:55.662 --> 24:58.698
Oh, I am single,
because I'm single.

25:00.300 --> 25:04.170
Um...let's just keep it
about you.

25:04.204 --> 25:06.306
[laughter]

25:09.109 --> 25:10.610
Come.
Let me show you something.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.585
Would you dance with me?

25:33.133 --> 25:36.803
(Luis)
So I'm standing here
with this beautiful girl,

25:36.836 --> 25:40.340
but all I can think of is
that I'm not sure

25:40.373 --> 25:44.911
if I really wasn't able
to bring 3.5 to the Joneses

25:44.944 --> 25:49.816
because I'm overwhelmed
and I'm not paying attention.

25:54.087 --> 25:55.922
You know what?

25:55.955 --> 25:59.092
Why don't you go home
and I go home?

25:59.092 --> 26:00.593
I've got a lot of things
to do tomorrow.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.562
I'm sure you do too.

26:02.595 --> 26:03.763
Okay.

26:03.797 --> 26:08.301
I can't focus on this girl
right now.

26:19.813 --> 26:21.047
After you.

26:39.833 --> 26:42.068
(Ryan)
Hi.
Is this Arty?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.906
No, you are not Arty.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.575
Good to see you.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.743
Good to see you.

26:51.544 --> 26:52.979
Hello.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.081
Wow.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.282
Arty.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.285
Is there anybody else
in there?

26:59.319 --> 27:00.453
That's it.

27:00.487 --> 27:02.756
Typically,
only the buyer shows up

27:02.789 --> 27:04.157
to a private showing,

27:04.190 --> 27:07.460
not the buyer and his gaggle
of girlfriends.

27:07.494 --> 27:09.863
This seller is gonna love this.

27:09.896 --> 27:14.434
(Ryan voice-over)
It's unclear how many roommates
exactly Arty is gonna have,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.903
but he says he wants
three things in an apartment:

27:16.936 --> 27:19.339
big, expensive, and cool.

27:19.372 --> 27:20.940
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:21.041 --> 27:23.643
- Hi.
- Welcome.

27:23.677 --> 27:24.878
I can do that.

27:24.911 --> 27:25.912
Welcome.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.447
Oh, my.
Welcome.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.050
Hi, I'm Arty.
Pleasure to meet you.

27:30.050 --> 27:31.718
- How are you? Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.354
So we can start.
Whatever you like.

27:34.387 --> 27:35.722
Okay, yeah.
Lead us around.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.568
(Jessica)
So you have a really beautiful
gourmet kitchen,

27:48.601 --> 27:51.638
which it's really nice,
and it's open.

27:55.075 --> 27:57.143
Please make yourselves at home.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.479
They are.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.314
I think also
the most important thing too

28:01.348 --> 28:03.550
is that you're right on top
of the Meatpacking District,

28:03.583 --> 28:05.185
so when you're out--

28:05.218 --> 28:08.254
so when you're out
and running around,

28:08.288 --> 28:09.422
you don't have a long commute.

28:09.456 --> 28:10.890
[water rushing]

28:27.607 --> 28:30.910
(Ryan)
Oh, this is great.

28:30.944 --> 28:33.847
In my opinion,
it is not necessary to test out

28:33.880 --> 28:37.217
every single mattress
when you're seeing an apartment.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.586
Ryan, come, come, Ryan.

28:39.619 --> 28:41.788
These mattresses aren't gonna
be there when you buy it.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.560
[speaking Russian]

28:47.594 --> 28:50.497
(Arty)
The girls really like this toy,
they're calling it.

28:52.766 --> 28:53.733
Yeah.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.535
Oh, my goodness.

28:56.670 --> 28:58.071
(Ryan)
Do you like this apartment?

28:58.104 --> 28:59.839
Honestly, the view
is not really what I like,

28:59.873 --> 29:01.541
and I kind of thought
I really wanted to live

29:01.574 --> 29:02.642
in this neighborhood.

29:02.676 --> 29:04.177
But I'm not sure right now.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.880
You know, I'd like to
look around a little bit more.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.515
You think we could see
some other stuff?

29:08.548 --> 29:09.683
Yeah, absolutely.

29:09.716 --> 29:12.686
I mean, this is
the first thing we're seeing.

29:12.719 --> 29:14.754
(Ryan)
Where did she--
where did you get that?

29:14.788 --> 29:16.256
[speaking Russian]

29:16.289 --> 29:17.357
What?

29:17.390 --> 29:18.825
She got it from
the frigerator.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.360
Ah.

29:20.393 --> 29:21.628
All right.

29:21.661 --> 29:24.164
I wonder if this
is actually worth

29:24.197 --> 29:26.566
a $20 million sale.

29:26.599 --> 29:27.634
This is.
It is.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.669
Anything is worth that.

29:29.703 --> 29:30.670
So we're good.

29:30.704 --> 29:32.205
Ladies, assemble.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.506
(Arty)
[laughs]

29:33.540 --> 29:34.841
[speaks Russian]
Let's go, guys.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.409
(Ryan)
[speaks Russian]

29:36.443 --> 29:38.244
- Coming up...
- We're having a problem.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.546
We're making a lot of mistakes.

29:39.579 --> 29:41.481
(Luis)
If I don't build a team,

29:41.514 --> 29:42.549
I'm going to crash.

29:49.389 --> 29:50.824
(Fredrik)
Is that what I think it is?

29:50.857 --> 29:52.158
Can you open just a little?

29:52.192 --> 29:53.226
What?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.627
That's a lot of hair.

29:54.661 --> 29:55.895
It's average maybe.

29:55.929 --> 29:58.164
Yes, like, 1970s.

29:58.198 --> 29:59.733
[laughter]

29:59.766 --> 30:01.568
You know what was cool
about the 1970s?

30:01.601 --> 30:03.236
Burt Reynolds.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.537
Burt Reynolds had chest hair.

30:04.571 --> 30:08.608
Do you think we should trim it
maybe a little bit?

30:10.110 --> 30:11.778
And it grows out.
It's not a big deal.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.179
If you want to trim it,
you have to do it yourself.

30:13.213 --> 30:14.447
You want me to trim
your chest hair?

30:14.481 --> 30:15.682
This is becoming really weird.

30:15.715 --> 30:17.217
That's the stipulation.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.086
(Fredrik)
I think on some twisted level,
I'm jealous,

30:20.120 --> 30:21.855
because I honestly
don't have chest hair.

30:24.057 --> 30:26.026
- Does it hurt?
- It's not pleasant.

30:26.059 --> 30:27.227
I don't want to hurt you.

30:28.395 --> 30:30.630
(Jordan)
Are you getting it all?

30:30.663 --> 30:31.965
What good is an F?

30:32.966 --> 30:34.300
Why in...

30:39.406 --> 30:41.041
[laughs]

30:41.074 --> 30:43.143
Anybody else wants an F?
No?

30:52.719 --> 30:55.622
How's my hair,
babe?

30:55.655 --> 30:59.292
(Fredrik)
Now that Ryan and I
are becoming business partners,

30:59.325 --> 31:00.560
actually working together,

31:00.593 --> 31:03.496
I'm gonna take this opportunity
to invite Ryan

31:03.530 --> 31:06.066
and his lovely girlfriend,
Emilia, for dinner.

31:07.767 --> 31:10.270
(Ryan)
I've been to dinner with Fredrik
and Derek once before,

31:10.303 --> 31:14.341
and it was...
not appetizing.

31:14.374 --> 31:15.742
How long have you known
each other?

31:15.775 --> 31:17.711
- Just last night.
- Last night?

31:21.815 --> 31:23.483
But things are different now.

31:23.516 --> 31:24.584
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.119
(Ryan)
I'm different.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.120
The world is different.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.188
We're in a different place.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.756
I can power through this.

31:29.789 --> 31:31.091
Is that your handbag,
Ryan?

31:31.124 --> 31:33.193
Yes, it is, actually.
It's the new thing.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.261
She got it for me.

31:35.295 --> 31:36.663
Good evening.
How are you tonight?

31:36.696 --> 31:37.831
- Hello.
- Good, how are you?

31:37.864 --> 31:39.933
So would you like a white wine
or red wine?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.601
- White.
- I think red.

31:44.938 --> 31:46.606
- White.
- Red.

31:48.108 --> 31:49.275
You want white?

31:49.309 --> 31:52.412
It's so acidic.
I mean, we drink red.

31:52.445 --> 31:54.447
Or we could do it
by the glass.

31:54.481 --> 31:55.682
What about this?

31:55.715 --> 31:56.850
Rosé.

31:56.883 --> 31:58.718
(Emilia)
Happy medium.
Ding-ding.

31:58.752 --> 32:00.587
Whatever you can bring out as
fast as possible would be great.

32:00.620 --> 32:02.055
- Sure, okay.
- Thank you.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.824
(Fredrik)
How do you put up with someone
who is this opinionated?

32:04.858 --> 32:07.060
I mean, he has a lot
of opinions, this one.

32:07.060 --> 32:08.194
- He does.
- You have to agree.

32:08.228 --> 32:10.163
I mean, you're not that easy
to work with.

32:10.196 --> 32:11.664
(Emilia)
He's a little stubborn.

32:11.698 --> 32:13.099
Yeah, a little, mm.

32:13.133 --> 32:14.200
You make a lot of faces.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.370
I think I'm very easy
to work with.

32:19.072 --> 32:20.740
[scoffs]

32:20.774 --> 32:24.644
Well, I'm so thankful
that you're here with him.

32:24.678 --> 32:25.645
You're beautiful.

32:25.679 --> 32:27.347
Oh, that's very sweet.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.748
Thank you.

32:28.782 --> 32:29.749
Do you have a lot of fun
in your apartment?

32:29.783 --> 32:30.950
- Is there a lot of fur?
- None.

32:30.984 --> 32:32.452
- Really?
- Not that I'm aware of, no.

32:32.485 --> 32:34.654
Strange.

32:34.688 --> 32:35.655
Yeah.

32:35.689 --> 32:36.956
You should do a portrait
of her.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.758
(Derek)
Would you want to do that?

32:38.792 --> 32:40.126
A portrait, hmm.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.795
I don't know.
I've never done that before.

32:41.828 --> 32:43.363
It's funny;
I've actually been drawing

32:43.396 --> 32:44.764
the human form lately,
so...

32:44.798 --> 32:46.633
I've never done that before.

32:46.666 --> 32:48.101
[laughs]

32:48.101 --> 32:50.437
Look, I'm happy to be working
with Fredrik.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.172
He is a great broker.

32:52.205 --> 32:55.809
And if that means some dinners
here and there, that is fine.

32:55.842 --> 32:58.511
But, like,
our significant others

32:58.545 --> 33:00.413
painting each other...

33:00.447 --> 33:01.815
He's very tasteful.

33:01.848 --> 33:03.116
That's why he married me.

33:03.149 --> 33:06.519
That is just, like,
way too much Fredrik in my life.

33:06.553 --> 33:09.422
So you're okay?
You don't mind?

33:09.456 --> 33:11.458
(Ryan voice-over)
What am I gonna say, no?

33:11.491 --> 33:12.559
I think she's beautiful.

33:12.592 --> 33:14.060
If someone wants to paint her,
sure.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.495
Why not?

33:15.528 --> 33:18.131
Although Fredrik will probably
invoice me for it afterwards.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.433
- Yes.
- Looks good.

33:20.467 --> 33:21.468
Bon appétit, yeah?

33:23.503 --> 33:25.538
As we say in Swedish.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.076
Ooh,
it's like lemonade.

33:32.412 --> 33:33.980
Can I have a piece
of the steak too?

33:34.080 --> 33:36.182
Of my steak?

33:36.216 --> 33:37.550
Yeah,
I want a piece of your steak.

33:39.252 --> 33:44.090
Nope,
you may not eat my meat, sir,

33:44.090 --> 33:46.826
without a co-listing agreement
for me to sign.

33:46.860 --> 33:47.894
Here.

33:47.927 --> 33:50.096
Thank you.
Thanks.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.798
I'm on my best behavior
tonight.

33:51.831 --> 33:53.700
(Emilia)
So what have you two
been up to lately?

33:53.733 --> 33:57.003
I'm glad you asked,
because the other day,

33:57.103 --> 33:59.139
Derek surprised me.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.042
He's ready.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.943
I'd like us to take
the next step.

34:05.745 --> 34:06.713
A child.

34:06.746 --> 34:08.181
(Ryan)
Congratulations.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.849
- That's awesome...
- Oh, that's amazing.

34:09.883 --> 34:12.318
- Honestly, truly, incredibly.
- Thanks, Ryan.

34:12.352 --> 34:14.320
(Emilia)
You're gonna be great daddies.

34:14.354 --> 34:16.823
- Do you think so?
- Yes, for sure.

34:16.856 --> 34:19.225
I just think the one thing
that we both agree on is that

34:19.259 --> 34:22.495
we wish someone that the mother
would be in our lives somehow.

34:22.529 --> 34:24.798
Not that there's anything wrong
with two dads.

34:24.831 --> 34:26.266
We just want
a female role model.

34:26.299 --> 34:28.435
Yeah, a female, like,
someone to look up to and,

34:28.468 --> 34:32.072
like, respect,
and the day she or he--

34:32.105 --> 34:34.341
the baby--gets older to like,
"Oh, my God.

34:34.374 --> 34:35.342
"That's amazing.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.143
You know,
she's my mother."

34:37.177 --> 34:41.314
Now it is time for the biggest
of all decisions:

34:41.348 --> 34:43.350
who will the egg donor be?

34:43.383 --> 34:44.684
(Ryan)
You want a little girl?

34:44.718 --> 34:46.252
I want a girl.

34:46.286 --> 34:47.821
We've been down
this road before

34:47.854 --> 34:50.490
and asking my best friend Anna,

34:50.523 --> 34:52.926
and we also asked
my sister-in-law for eggs.

34:52.959 --> 34:56.363
It was a no, unfortunately,
but most surrogacy clinics

34:56.396 --> 34:59.399
advise us to pick an egg donor
that's in our life already,

34:59.432 --> 35:00.667
someone that we know.

35:00.700 --> 35:01.701
What about you guys?

35:01.735 --> 35:04.104
Are you ever gonna have kids?

35:04.137 --> 35:06.172
[laughter]

35:06.206 --> 35:07.874
What?
What was that?

35:07.907 --> 35:09.309
Absolutely.

35:09.342 --> 35:11.177
I mean, we've been trying to
get pregnant for years though.

35:11.211 --> 35:12.445
Nothing comes out.

35:12.479 --> 35:14.481
- Us too.
- [laughs]

35:16.950 --> 35:18.952
Oh, I get it, yeah.

35:19.052 --> 35:23.390
(Fredrik)
I actually really enjoy this
Ryan-Fredrik friendship thing.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.093
No?
I think so.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.328
This was a lot of fun.

35:28.361 --> 35:30.697
[laughter]

35:33.967 --> 35:35.468
[telephone rings]

35:40.073 --> 35:41.808
I think we're having
a problem.

35:41.841 --> 35:42.809
I'm a perfectionist.

35:42.842 --> 35:44.110
I want everything
to be done

35:44.144 --> 35:45.912
exactly the way
it needs to be done.

35:45.945 --> 35:47.647
I know.
We're making a lot of mistakes.

35:47.681 --> 35:49.849
393...for example.

35:49.883 --> 35:53.820
I had in mind the biggest event
the world has ever seen.

35:53.853 --> 35:56.089
It didn't happen.

35:56.089 --> 35:57.824
Right now,
I'm your assistant.

35:57.857 --> 35:59.459
I'm an event planner.

35:59.492 --> 36:01.061
I'm catering food
for these events.

36:01.094 --> 36:03.063
I'm doing the invitations.
I'm doing the RSVPs.

36:03.096 --> 36:04.564
I'm doing the follow-up.
I'm doing the marketing.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.099
I'm doing the listings.

36:06.132 --> 36:07.133
It's a little insane.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.134
Listen,
I'm not blaming you,

36:08.168 --> 36:09.235
and I'm sorry,
Roni.

36:09.269 --> 36:10.637
I know you're doing
a lot of things,

36:10.670 --> 36:11.671
and I know I'm putting
a lot on your plate.

36:11.705 --> 36:13.306
We have all of these clients,

36:13.340 --> 36:15.508
and we're not paying
enough attention to each one.

36:17.143 --> 36:20.080
My listing with the Joneses
was a true wake-up call.

36:20.113 --> 36:22.649
Most brokers at my level
have a great team of brokers

36:22.682 --> 36:24.150
that are working for them.

36:24.184 --> 36:25.585
Me,
I have Ronita.

36:25.618 --> 36:29.522
She is amazing,
but the reality is,

36:29.556 --> 36:31.091
it's not enough.

36:31.124 --> 36:33.326
I think we just need
additional support.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.561
We need some help.

36:34.594 --> 36:38.732
We'll interview one person,
see how it goes.

36:38.765 --> 36:41.701
I would like to have people
that represent my brand,

36:41.735 --> 36:43.703
that have the same level
of taste.

36:43.737 --> 36:45.138
(Luis)
If I don't build a team,

36:45.171 --> 36:48.708
I'm not just going to not
grow my business.

36:48.742 --> 36:50.143
I'm going to crash.

36:50.176 --> 36:52.278
We're in the midst
of something amazing.

36:52.312 --> 36:54.881
We're in the midst
of becoming number one.

36:54.914 --> 36:56.149
We need to be bulletproof.

36:56.182 --> 36:58.918
There needs to be a system
where there is zero mistakes.

37:00.453 --> 37:02.822
You know I love you,
and you know I believe in you,

37:02.856 --> 37:03.890
and I believe in us.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.127
We're gonna fix this.

37:12.932 --> 37:14.134
[dog yelps]

37:14.167 --> 37:15.669
Come here.

37:15.702 --> 37:17.804
Get into bed.

37:17.837 --> 37:19.639
Well,
that was a nice dinner.

37:19.673 --> 37:21.574
Yeah.

37:21.608 --> 37:25.211
So I was thinking
as we were walking home,

37:25.245 --> 37:29.282
what if--I mean, I know
it sounds so crazy even, like,

37:29.315 --> 37:31.084
thinking the words,
and then saying the words

37:31.117 --> 37:35.555
are really crazy,
but what if, like, you know...

37:36.756 --> 37:37.724
What?

37:37.757 --> 37:38.792
You weren't thinking it?

37:38.825 --> 37:39.959
What do you mean?

37:53.473 --> 37:55.075
Yes, Ryan.
It's strange. It's weird.

37:55.108 --> 37:56.976
But, like, weirder things
have happened.

37:58.678 --> 38:01.915
Are you being serious?

38:02.015 --> 38:03.917
I'm just saying,
I'm thinking of different ideas.

38:04.017 --> 38:07.253
We both agree that we want
to ask someone that we know

38:07.287 --> 38:10.423
is, like, genuinely
a really amazing person.

38:11.424 --> 38:12.425
Right.

38:16.930 --> 38:18.198
I like her.

38:18.231 --> 38:20.367
I like her a lot.

38:20.400 --> 38:24.404
She's very sweet
and very sincere.

38:24.437 --> 38:27.040
My whole life,
I act from intuition,

38:27.040 --> 38:30.110
this strong feeling in my gut,
and there's something to be said

38:30.143 --> 38:32.045
when you're sitting
in front of a person,

38:32.078 --> 38:34.214
and you look into her eyes,
and you see kindness,

38:34.247 --> 38:36.049
you see intelligence,
you see beauty,

38:36.049 --> 38:37.517
and you know that person.

38:37.550 --> 38:39.319
Those are the kind of things
and features

38:39.352 --> 38:42.655
I will never be able to find in
an egg bank or a piece of paper.

38:42.689 --> 38:44.958
I've just got this feeling that
she might be, like, the one.

38:45.058 --> 38:46.059
I mean,
I don't know.

38:46.092 --> 38:47.494
Out of all the women
in the world...

38:47.527 --> 38:48.495
[laughs]

38:48.528 --> 38:49.662
Emilia.

38:49.696 --> 38:51.698
I mean,
life is not always logical.

38:51.731 --> 38:54.768
No, I...
now that you say...

38:55.835 --> 38:57.137
Oh, it just sound a bit--

38:57.170 --> 38:58.872
kind of weird
at the same time.

39:00.540 --> 39:01.641
What do you think?

39:01.675 --> 39:03.910
What are you thinking?

39:04.010 --> 39:05.412
[dog yelps]

39:05.445 --> 39:06.680
Coming up...

39:06.713 --> 39:08.148
I think we could do a nice party
just in the closet, huh?

39:08.181 --> 39:09.482
[laughter]

39:11.284 --> 39:12.719
(Ryan)
This is a real estate showing,

39:12.752 --> 39:14.020
not a Cabo Wabo cantina.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.355
There, that's art.
That's art.

39:15.388 --> 39:16.423
It's okay.

39:16.456 --> 39:18.191
It's not expensive whatsoever.

39:26.099 --> 39:28.068
(Ryan)
He should be here shortly.

39:28.101 --> 39:30.036
It depends on if he went to bed
last night or not.

39:30.070 --> 39:32.706
Today I have another showing
with Arty,

39:32.739 --> 39:35.275
and we are not off
to a good start.

39:38.912 --> 39:40.080
[knock at door]

39:40.113 --> 39:41.581
- They're here.
- I'll--I'll get it.

39:41.614 --> 39:43.583
- Perfect.
- You hold on right here.

39:43.616 --> 39:44.818
- Hello.
- Hey, Ry.

39:44.851 --> 39:45.819
What's up, man?

39:45.852 --> 39:46.953
I'm kind of hoping that Arty

39:47.053 --> 39:48.888
forgets to bring the girls
this time.

39:48.922 --> 39:50.123
- You remember Makasi.
- Hi.

39:50.156 --> 39:51.191
Hi.

39:51.224 --> 39:53.560
Hi. You're new.
How are you?

39:53.593 --> 39:55.128
Ohh.

39:55.161 --> 39:56.663
Oh, my God.

39:56.696 --> 39:59.833
This may seem like fun and games
to Arty,

39:59.866 --> 40:02.135
but these brokers
are my colleagues.

40:02.168 --> 40:04.404
And if I show up with a client
who is unreliable...

40:04.437 --> 40:05.739
I brought
your favorite tequila.

40:05.772 --> 40:07.507
You brought it to the showing.
Great.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.309
They're not gonna want
to do business with me.

40:09.342 --> 40:10.810
(Tracy)
So you ready for a tour?

40:10.844 --> 40:12.412
Yeah, there's a bunch of us,
so it might take a little time.

40:12.445 --> 40:13.513
That's okay.

40:15.148 --> 40:17.183
(Ryan)
Arty wanted to be
on a higher floor,

40:17.217 --> 40:19.052
and he didn't want to do
any work,

40:19.085 --> 40:20.487
so this place is perfect.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.655
(Tracy)
And we have open west
and southern exposures.

40:22.689 --> 40:24.057
(Arty)
Wow, guys.

40:24.090 --> 40:26.092
(Tracy)
These owners did this
custom renovation.

40:26.126 --> 40:27.227
It was raw loft space,

40:27.260 --> 40:30.030
and they combined two apartments
to create this.

40:30.063 --> 40:31.231
Do you have a lot of clothes?

40:31.264 --> 40:33.366
I do.
She has more than me, though.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.868
- Come with me.
- She has more than me.

40:36.269 --> 40:38.371
I think we could do a nice party
just in the closet, huh?

40:38.405 --> 40:40.173
[laughter]

40:40.206 --> 40:41.741
I think we really need
the tequila now.

40:43.576 --> 40:45.078
Hey,
do you have any glasses?

40:45.111 --> 40:46.079
Are you serious?

40:46.112 --> 40:47.781
Ryan,
be a gentleman.

40:47.814 --> 40:49.416
Tracy...

40:49.449 --> 40:52.318
(Ryan) Arty,
this is a real estate showing,

40:52.352 --> 40:55.155
not a Cabo Wabo cantina.

40:55.188 --> 40:56.456
- Ryan.
- Yes.

40:56.489 --> 40:58.224
You know it's part
of the deal

40:58.258 --> 40:59.859
that you have to do
a shot with us.

40:59.893 --> 41:02.062
Yeah, I just had breakfast,
so obviously.

41:02.095 --> 41:03.697
[laughter]

41:03.730 --> 41:05.398
I guess I'll do one shot.

41:05.432 --> 41:07.801
[speaks Russian]

41:07.834 --> 41:09.936
I don't know if we should do
more tequila.

41:26.453 --> 41:27.987
(Ryan)
There, that's art.
That's art.

41:28.088 --> 41:29.522
It's okay.
It's okay.

41:29.556 --> 41:32.492
That's great.
It's not expensive whatsoever.

41:32.525 --> 41:35.228
(Ryan voice-over)
Typically, I've got very,
very serious clients,

41:35.261 --> 41:36.763
or they send
their business managers.

41:36.796 --> 41:37.931
There's lawyers attached,

41:37.964 --> 41:39.599
architects, contractors,
what have you.

41:39.632 --> 41:41.267
This just looks like
it's a party

41:41.301 --> 41:44.137
and maybe showing off
to a bunch of girls.

41:44.170 --> 41:45.972
I don't know, and I don't want
to waste my time.

41:46.006 --> 41:49.309
So...so you think maybe
you're a little distracted?

41:51.411 --> 41:53.113
I think we both are.

41:54.981 --> 41:56.516
It's, like, 6,900.

41:56.549 --> 41:58.118
- Really? 6,900?
- Yeah.

41:58.118 --> 41:59.519
You know that's
my favorite number.

41:59.552 --> 42:01.087
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

42:01.121 --> 42:02.622
- So it's huge.
- So...

42:02.655 --> 42:03.957
I'd like to be
a little bit higher.

42:04.057 --> 42:06.092
I feel like I want to be
on top of the city.

42:06.126 --> 42:07.694
I want to feel like I'm
on top of the world.

42:07.727 --> 42:08.862
You know, I just think
we should take a look

42:08.895 --> 42:09.896
at a few more spots.

42:09.929 --> 42:12.132
[laughter]

42:12.165 --> 42:14.401
I'm gonna get back to the...

42:14.434 --> 42:15.935
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll be back.

42:18.705 --> 42:20.840
I'm starting to wonder if Arty

42:20.874 --> 42:23.276
really wants to invest
$20 million.

42:23.309 --> 42:25.645
Before we go,
we have to make the girls happy.

42:25.679 --> 42:27.380
(woman)
Yes.

42:27.414 --> 42:31.184
(Ryan)
We need to have a little talk.

42:32.719 --> 42:35.622

<i>Listing: New York...</i>

42:35.655 --> 42:38.124
(Luis)
This place, there's something
very artistic about it.

42:38.158 --> 42:39.426
Jackson Pollock lived here.

42:39.459 --> 42:41.728
(Luis)
We have six offers.

42:41.761 --> 42:44.230
Now, the question is,
how high can we go?

42:44.264 --> 42:45.865
I'm all about having fun,

42:45.899 --> 42:48.468
except when I'm showing
$20 million apartments.

42:48.501 --> 42:50.337
You know, I could easily find
another broker.

42:50.370 --> 42:54.174
(Fredrik)
Would you give your eggs to us?

42:54.207 --> 42:56.976
(Emilia)
There are two people out there
that really want to have a kid.

42:57.010 --> 42:58.178
What the f*** is going on?

42:58.211 --> 42:59.813
Do you ask a lot of people
for their eggs?
