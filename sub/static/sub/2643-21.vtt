00:02.884 --> 00:04.785
Leonard, are you in the shower?

00:04.786 --> 00:07.922
I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

00:07.923 --> 00:10.057
I asked if you
were in the shower,

00:10.058 --> 00:12.026
but that's moot now!

00:12.027 --> 00:13.194
What?

00:13.195 --> 00:18.032
Moot! Rendered unimportant
by recent events!

00:18.033 --> 00:20.584
I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

00:20.585 --> 00:22.403
I have to skip
the chitchat.

00:22.404 --> 00:23.671
Emergency.

00:23.672 --> 00:25.539
What kind of
emergency?

00:25.540 --> 00:28.175
Mathematical--
32-ounce banana smoothie,

00:28.176 --> 00:30.244
16-ounce bladder.

00:30.245 --> 00:32.813
You might not
want to do that.

00:32.814 --> 00:34.548
I assure you I do.

00:34.549 --> 00:37.151
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

00:37.152 --> 00:39.103
What?!

00:39.988 --> 00:41.956
Hello, Sheldon.

00:41.957 --> 00:43.424
What are you doing in there?

00:43.425 --> 00:44.692
She can't be in here!

00:44.693 --> 00:47.361
We were in here first;
<i>you</i> can't be in here.

00:47.362 --> 00:49.029
According to
the roommate agreement,

00:49.030 --> 00:50.498
paragraph nine, subsection B,

00:50.499 --> 00:52.233
"The right
to bathroom privacy

00:52.234 --> 00:54.535
is suspended in the event
of force majeure."

00:54.536 --> 00:56.203
And believe me,
I am experiencing

00:56.204 --> 00:59.140
a <i>very</i> majeure force.

00:59.141 --> 01:01.642
Come on, you can't
wait two minutes?

01:01.643 --> 01:04.578
Oh, Leonard,
let the man pee.

01:09.317 --> 01:12.019
Penny? Penny?

01:12.020 --> 01:13.687
Penny?

01:13.688 --> 01:15.088
What?

01:15.089 --> 01:17.291

01:46.554 --> 01:48.288
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

01:48.319 --> 01:49.786
you are officially charged

01:49.787 --> 01:52.139
with two violations
of the roommate agreement.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.657
Do you waive

01:53.658 --> 01:55.409
reading of the charges?

01:55.410 --> 01:56.543
Yeah, fine.

01:56.544 --> 01:57.878
Hang on. No.

01:57.879 --> 02:00.397
My client does not waive
reading of the charges.

02:00.398 --> 02:01.665
Oh.

02:01.666 --> 02:04.668
Cool. I've got
a lawyer.

02:05.403 --> 02:07.921
And I've seen her naked.

02:09.707 --> 02:11.274
Proceed.

02:11.275 --> 02:12.876
Very well.

02:14.078 --> 02:15.379
"Count the first:

02:15.380 --> 02:17.881
"On or about
the 28th day of April,

02:17.882 --> 02:20.684
"the accused did knowingly
and with malice aforethought

02:20.685 --> 02:22.652
"deny access
to the shared bathroom

02:22.653 --> 02:26.440
"in a time of emergency, to wit,
my back teeth were floating.

02:28.092 --> 02:30.694
"Count the second:
the accused exceeded

02:30.695 --> 02:32.996
"the agreed upon occupancy
of the shower,

02:32.997 --> 02:35.665
"to wit, one,
unless we are under attack

02:35.666 --> 02:37.534
by water-soluble aliens."

02:39.337 --> 02:41.705
Can I see
the roommate agreement?

02:41.706 --> 02:44.241
Um, it's fairly technical.

02:45.610 --> 02:47.127
I think I can handle it.

02:48.046 --> 02:50.881
Top of her class,
Cambridge University.

02:50.882 --> 02:53.283
Licensed to practice law
in three countries

02:53.284 --> 02:55.052
and your face.

02:59.757 --> 03:02.759
All right,
based on a cursory reading,

03:02.760 --> 03:05.445
it doesn't look like you have
much of a case, Sheldon.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.365
Do so, do so.

03:08.366 --> 03:10.150
Oh, I'm afraid not.

03:10.151 --> 03:13.036
Section seven here, on
the right to enter the bathroom

03:13.037 --> 03:15.405
in emergency situations,
is not specific

03:15.406 --> 03:17.607
as to what constitutes
an emergency.

03:17.608 --> 03:18.875
Oh, that's ridiculous!

03:18.876 --> 03:21.178
A bathroom emergency
is self-explanatory.

03:21.179 --> 03:24.247
Is it? If Leonard forgot
to trim his nose hair,

03:24.248 --> 03:26.650
could he barge in
while you were showering?

03:26.651 --> 03:29.136
Irrelevant. Leonard
doesn't trim his nose hair.

03:29.137 --> 03:32.756
He thinks because he's short
nobody can see up there.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.695
My point is, Sheldon,
the legal principle is,

03:38.696 --> 03:41.898
ambiguity in a contract benefits
the party that did not draft it,

03:41.899 --> 03:43.150
in this case, Leonard.

03:43.151 --> 03:45.519
So much for count one.
But...

03:45.520 --> 03:47.804
There's no buts, Sheldon;
that's how the law works.

03:47.805 --> 03:49.523
Schooled!

03:54.078 --> 03:55.862
As for the shower capacity
issue,

03:55.863 --> 03:57.714
I cite addendum J.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.217
"When Sheldon showers second,
any and all measures

04:00.218 --> 04:03.203
shall be taken to ensure an
adequate supply of hot water."

04:03.204 --> 04:06.323
I believe this supercedes
the occupancy issue.

04:06.324 --> 04:09.392
Superceded!

04:12.930 --> 04:14.998
This isn't over.

04:17.702 --> 04:20.220
No offense, but
shower sex with you

04:20.221 --> 04:22.739
is now the <i>second</i> best thing
that's happened today.

04:25.510 --> 04:28.812
Mmm, Greek food
on pizza night?

04:28.813 --> 04:31.448
This is the most delightfully
cruel thing we've done to Sheldon

04:31.449 --> 04:33.583
since we left that fake message
from Stephen Hawking

04:33.584 --> 04:35.252
on his voice mail.

04:35.253 --> 04:37.353
Seriously?

04:37.354 --> 04:40.824
I wish to discuss your theories
of black holes.

04:42.360 --> 04:47.164
Meet me at the Randy's Donut
by the airport at 2:00 a.m.

04:50.468 --> 04:52.469
What is that you're eating?

04:52.470 --> 04:54.204
Tonight is pizza night.

04:54.205 --> 04:57.474
I'd like to refer that
to my attorney.

04:58.543 --> 05:00.443
According to what I see here,

05:00.444 --> 05:02.545
Thursday nights
are Franconi's pizza night.

05:02.546 --> 05:05.081
Yes, and when Franconi's
went out of business,

05:05.082 --> 05:07.150
we switched to Graziano's.

05:07.151 --> 05:08.435
That's interesting.

05:08.436 --> 05:12.222
Can you just switch
restaurants like that, Priya?

05:13.658 --> 05:15.525
A good question, Howard.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.894
Turns out you can't.

05:17.895 --> 05:19.229
According to
the document

05:19.230 --> 05:21.097
you drew up, Sheldon,
the selection

05:21.098 --> 05:23.533
of a new takeout restaurant
requires public hearings

05:23.534 --> 05:25.619
and a 60-day comment period.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.671
Were those criteria met?

05:34.111 --> 05:36.313
No.

05:37.014 --> 05:39.149
Opa! Opa!
Opa!

05:40.651 --> 05:42.686
This is Greek food?

05:42.687 --> 05:44.754
Leonard, you hate Greek food.

05:44.755 --> 05:47.324
Not as much as you.

05:51.596 --> 05:55.165
Fine. I'm nothing
if not adaptable.

05:55.967 --> 05:59.402
I got you the
lamb kabob.

05:59.403 --> 06:01.437
Thank you.

06:21.726 --> 06:23.360
If you think about it,

06:23.361 --> 06:26.096
Greek food isn't that far
from Italian food.

06:26.097 --> 06:28.632
They share a spice palette.

06:34.005 --> 06:37.490
And what a civilization
is the Greeks'!

06:42.747 --> 06:46.483
They gave us science, democracy,

06:46.484 --> 06:50.370
and little cubes of charred meat
that taste like sweat.

06:53.591 --> 06:55.892
Penny? Penny?

06:55.893 --> 06:57.427
Penny?

06:58.329 --> 06:59.546
Hey. What's up?

06:59.547 --> 07:03.466
The mean Indian lady tried
to make me eat lamb.

07:05.669 --> 07:07.171
Congratulations.

07:07.196 --> 07:08.736
Pizza night will now
be at your apartment.

07:08.739 --> 07:10.507
Order one.

07:10.508 --> 07:11.833
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

07:11.858 --> 07:13.610
I'm meeting Amy and
Bernadette for dinner.

07:13.611 --> 07:15.612
But you're welcome
to tag along.

07:15.613 --> 07:16.880
A girls' night?

07:16.881 --> 07:18.948
Oh, I don't know
if I'm up for an evening

07:18.949 --> 07:22.252
talking about rainbows,
unicorns and menstrual cramps.

07:22.253 --> 07:24.571
Okay, suit yourself.

07:24.572 --> 07:27.157
We'll probably be
trashing Priya a little.

07:27.158 --> 07:29.826
Shotgun.

07:30.961 --> 07:32.796
Okay, I'd like
to propose a toast

07:32.797 --> 07:34.581
to a wonderful
girls' night out.

07:35.399 --> 07:39.035
Fair warning--
we can get ca-razy.

07:39.036 --> 07:43.106
Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars
and pretended to be dragons.

07:43.974 --> 07:45.742
Really, Amy?

07:45.743 --> 07:47.160
Tobacco and alcohol?

07:47.161 --> 07:50.347
Need I remind you not a lot of
scientific discoveries were made

07:50.348 --> 07:52.916
by people having a good time?

07:54.985 --> 07:56.553
Why did you bring him?

07:56.554 --> 07:58.254
He's harshing my buzz.

07:58.255 --> 08:00.423
I felt sorry for him.

08:00.424 --> 08:02.458
Priya's giving him a hard time.

08:02.459 --> 08:05.962
Ooh, the Priya bashing's
starting early. Yay!

08:06.847 --> 08:10.567
Okay, what's up
with those pantsuits?

08:10.568 --> 08:12.402
I need some context.

08:12.403 --> 08:13.703
Pantsuits suck.

08:13.704 --> 08:15.138
And that opens her up

08:15.139 --> 08:17.157
to justifiable ridicule
for wearing them.

08:17.158 --> 08:18.608
Good one, Bernadette.

08:19.510 --> 08:22.712
See? Ca-razy.

08:27.087 --> 08:29.356
Whee...!

08:33.427 --> 08:35.495
You smell like baby powder.

08:35.496 --> 08:37.096
It's talc.

08:37.097 --> 08:40.167
But as that's a primary
ingredient of baby powder,

08:40.168 --> 08:42.635
I understand your confusion.

08:42.636 --> 08:46.206
Oh, I'm not
confused at all.

08:46.207 --> 08:49.409
You're like a sexy toddler.

08:50.278 --> 08:53.246
I don't know
how to process that.

08:54.248 --> 08:55.615
I do.

08:56.617 --> 08:59.719
♪ Amy and Sheldon
sitting in a tree ♪

08:59.720 --> 09:03.623
♪ K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G. ♪

09:03.624 --> 09:06.726
That's too many S's
for "kissing."

09:06.727 --> 09:10.030
Not if they're doing it
for a long time.

09:11.766 --> 09:14.968
Sheldon... have you
ever kissed a girl?

09:14.969 --> 09:18.688
Other than my mother,
my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.440
But in the interest
of full disclosure,

09:20.441 --> 09:22.275
I was once on a bus

09:22.276 --> 09:24.377
and had to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

09:24.378 --> 09:27.981
to an elderly nun who passed out
from heat exhaustion.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.001
Every year I get
a Christmas card from her,

09:31.002 --> 09:34.554
signed with far
too many X's and O's.

09:34.555 --> 09:36.423
That doesn't count.

09:36.424 --> 09:38.592
Aren't you even
a little curious?

09:38.593 --> 09:42.462
Yeah, you're a scientist--
where is the curiosity?

09:42.463 --> 09:45.031
I'm available
for experimentation.

09:48.536 --> 09:50.337
Thank you.

09:50.338 --> 09:51.538
Not necessary.

09:51.539 --> 09:53.840
We know everything
there is to know about kissing.

09:53.841 --> 09:57.694
It requires 34 facial muscles
and 112 postural muscles.

09:57.695 --> 09:58.879
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.947
Give me some sugar, bestie.

10:04.118 --> 10:06.453
I'm certainly glad
no one said they were curious

10:06.454 --> 10:09.573
about Aztec human sacrifice.

10:09.574 --> 10:12.459
Hey, I know--
let's take Sheldon dancing.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.661
Ooh, I totally want
to see Sheldon dance.

10:14.662 --> 10:17.881
I bet he looks like
a spider on a hot plate.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.134
No, thank you,
but for the record,

10:21.135 --> 10:22.369
I'm an excellent dancer.

10:22.370 --> 10:25.071
Proficient in the rumba,
waltz and cha-cha.

10:25.072 --> 10:26.139
Really?

10:26.140 --> 10:27.841
I don't see why
that's surprising.

10:27.842 --> 10:29.559
I excel at so many things.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.078
You've had my sourdough bread.

10:32.079 --> 10:34.548
Did you take dance lessons?

10:34.549 --> 10:35.916
Against my will.

10:35.917 --> 10:38.018
In the South,
preadolescent children

10:38.019 --> 10:40.487
are forced through
a process called cotillion,

10:40.488 --> 10:42.856
which indoctrinates them
with all the social graces

10:42.857 --> 10:47.694
and dance skills needed to
function in 18th century Vienna.

10:47.695 --> 10:51.798
Oh, we are so
taking you dancing.

10:51.799 --> 10:54.167
No, you most certainly are not.

10:54.168 --> 10:56.836
Well, what does your cotillion
training say is expected

10:56.837 --> 10:59.039
of a gentleman when three ladies
ask him

10:59.040 --> 11:01.074
to escort them
to a dance soiree?

11:04.145 --> 11:06.413
I saved a nun's life.

11:06.414 --> 11:08.648
Why am I being punished?

11:15.606 --> 11:17.557
Take us someplace we can waltz.

11:17.558 --> 11:18.792
Where you can what?

11:18.793 --> 11:21.528
Waltz. It's a social dance
from Austria

11:21.529 --> 11:24.564
choreographed
to a three-four time signature.

11:37.945 --> 11:40.814
Oh, waltz.

11:44.118 --> 11:45.952
Here we go.

11:48.222 --> 11:52.092

11:52.093 --> 11:54.311

12:15.816 --> 12:18.418
Shake it baby,
shake it!

12:18.419 --> 12:21.287
<i>Muy caliente,</i> Sheldon!

12:21.288 --> 12:23.356
Care to dance?

12:23.357 --> 12:26.176
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

12:26.177 --> 12:28.194
How about you?

12:28.195 --> 12:31.464
Oh, what the hell.

12:31.465 --> 12:33.383
Ooh!

12:50.034 --> 12:52.351
How come if we're
the smart people,

12:52.352 --> 12:54.688
we don't do this
every night?

12:54.689 --> 12:57.290
What's 16 times 14?

12:57.291 --> 13:00.827
My burps taste
like cranberry juice.

13:02.630 --> 13:05.298
And there's your answer.

13:05.299 --> 13:08.201
Would you like to come in
for a nightcap?

13:08.202 --> 13:10.036
If you're referring
to the beverage,

13:10.037 --> 13:11.571
you know I don't drink.

13:11.572 --> 13:13.073
If you're referring
to the hat you don

13:13.074 --> 13:17.377
while wearing a nightshirt and
holding a candle, I have one.

13:18.412 --> 13:19.746
I have Yoo-hoo.

13:19.747 --> 13:22.248
It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo.

13:23.350 --> 13:25.518
The name literally beckons.

13:29.290 --> 13:30.790
Make yourself comfortable.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.025
Thank you.

13:33.594 --> 13:35.428
Is someone smoking?

13:35.429 --> 13:37.363
Oh, that's just Ricky.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.471
You own a smoking monkey?

13:44.472 --> 13:46.423
Don't be silly.
He's one of the animals

13:46.424 --> 13:48.575
in my department's
nicotine addiction study.

13:50.311 --> 13:52.078
What's he doing here?

13:52.079 --> 13:53.379
I'm giving him emphysema.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.549
The least I can do is let him
hang out and watch cable.

13:57.384 --> 13:59.819
Remarkable.

14:00.855 --> 14:02.856
Aren't you worried
about secondhand smoke?

14:02.857 --> 14:05.258
A little.
The real danger is him biting

14:05.259 --> 14:07.060
my face off while I'm sleeping.

14:10.397 --> 14:13.450
Is he deliberately
blowing smoke at me?

14:13.451 --> 14:16.536
Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

14:19.957 --> 14:21.441
Thank you.

14:22.493 --> 14:24.244
May I share
something with you

14:24.245 --> 14:25.712
that's troubling me?

14:25.713 --> 14:27.130
Of course.

14:27.131 --> 14:29.215
What's rattling around that
big bulbous head of yours?

14:29.216 --> 14:32.051
Priya has essentially nullified

14:32.052 --> 14:33.953
my roommate agreement
with Leonard,

14:33.954 --> 14:37.724
making life in the apartment
very uncomfortable for me.

14:37.725 --> 14:41.094
And you want me
to kill her? Done.

14:41.095 --> 14:42.962
No, of course not.

14:42.963 --> 14:43.963
I trained Ricky how to smoke.

14:43.964 --> 14:45.431
I can train him
to shoot a poison dart.

14:45.432 --> 14:48.768
No jury would convict us
'cause people love monkeys.

14:50.137 --> 14:51.604
I understand

14:51.605 --> 14:53.840
the alcohol has stirred up
whatever it is

14:53.841 --> 14:55.909
that makes girls go wild...

14:55.910 --> 14:59.879
but I really need to talk
to smart Amy now.

15:01.015 --> 15:02.949
Excuse me.

15:03.884 --> 15:05.585
Have you considered
that your intelligence

15:05.586 --> 15:09.839
might be the very thing
causing your dilemma?

15:14.661 --> 15:15.829
No.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.130
What do you think Ricky
over here would do

15:17.131 --> 15:19.766
if an interloper
encroached on his territory?

15:19.767 --> 15:24.604
Well, when challenged, monkeys
generally assert their dominance

15:24.605 --> 15:30.009
through chasing, assault
and a stylized penile display.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.445
That's a little outside
my comfort zone.

15:32.446 --> 15:33.947
You're being too literal.

15:33.948 --> 15:37.283
My point is, he would not meekly
surrender to the rules,

15:37.284 --> 15:39.018
and neither should you.

15:39.019 --> 15:41.955
Are you suggesting I play dirty?

15:41.956 --> 15:44.290
Yes, dirty.

15:44.291 --> 15:48.728
Dirty... dirty... dirty.

15:51.232 --> 15:54.000
Which brings me to our
next order of business.

15:57.872 --> 16:00.607
Fascinating.

16:00.608 --> 16:02.842
I hope you don't take
what I'm about to do

16:02.843 --> 16:04.878
as a comment
on what we just did.

16:19.126 --> 16:22.462
Who's to say you shouldn't be
dissecting our brains?

16:24.198 --> 16:26.583
You really are an ass.

16:29.703 --> 16:31.537
Morning, Sheldon.

16:31.538 --> 16:33.256
Oh, good, you're up.

16:33.257 --> 16:35.408
I've written a new
and improved

16:35.409 --> 16:38.094
roommate agreement
that benefits me greatly.

16:38.095 --> 16:40.129
I'd like you to sign it.

16:40.931 --> 16:43.016
Why would I want
to do that?

16:43.017 --> 16:44.784
Excellent question.

16:44.785 --> 16:47.720
Do you remember
what happened to the alien,

16:47.721 --> 16:50.473
played by talented character
actor Frank Gorshin,

16:50.474 --> 16:54.594
in the <i>Star Trek</i> episode "Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

16:54.595 --> 16:58.531
Uh, Captain Kirk activated
the self-destruct sequence

16:58.532 --> 17:00.767
and threatened to blow up
the <i>Enterprise</i>

17:00.768 --> 17:03.002
and kill them both
unless he gave in?

17:03.003 --> 17:04.270
Affirmative.

17:04.271 --> 17:08.308
Computer, this is
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

17:09.777 --> 17:11.810
Activate self-destruct sequence.

17:11.811 --> 17:14.414
Code 1-1-A-2-B.

17:14.415 --> 17:17.083
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Self-destruct sequence
activated.

17:20.988 --> 17:23.122
What are you
gonna do, Sheldon,

17:23.123 --> 17:24.523
blow up the apartment?

17:24.525 --> 17:28.961
That was my first thought,
but all my cool stuff is here.

17:28.962 --> 17:31.531
So what happens
when it counts down?

17:31.532 --> 17:33.766
Unless Leonard signs
the new agreement

17:33.767 --> 17:35.818
in the next 41 seconds,

17:35.819 --> 17:39.772
this computer will send an
e-mail to your parents in India

17:39.773 --> 17:42.008
saying that you're in
a secret relationship

17:42.009 --> 17:44.360
with the
whiter-than-Marshmallow-Fluff

17:44.361 --> 17:46.045
Leonard Hofstadter.

17:46.046 --> 17:48.881
Oh, my God.

17:48.882 --> 17:49.982
What's the big deal?

17:49.983 --> 17:51.534
Trust me, it's a big deal.

17:51.535 --> 17:53.652
They're gonna find out
about me eventually, right?

17:53.653 --> 17:55.154
Yeah, of course,
just not today.

17:55.155 --> 17:56.723
20 seconds.

17:56.724 --> 17:57.890
Are you ashamed of me?

17:57.891 --> 17:59.092
Of course not.

17:59.093 --> 18:00.727
Then why can't we
tell your parents?

18:00.728 --> 18:02.061
Please, don't push this.

18:02.062 --> 18:04.297
He does that all the time,
doesn't he? 15.

18:04.298 --> 18:06.366
Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win.
Turn it off.

18:06.367 --> 18:07.433
No, he's bluffing.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.769
I never bluff. Ten.
It's blackmail!

18:09.770 --> 18:10.837
Nine.
We give up.

18:10.838 --> 18:12.855
Eight.
This is ridiculous.

18:12.856 --> 18:14.640
It's a laptop
with a full charge.

18:14.641 --> 18:16.175
Honestly,
what do you see in him?

18:16.176 --> 18:18.111
Give him what he wants
or we're done.

18:18.112 --> 18:19.078
Three.
Really?

18:19.079 --> 18:20.646
Two.
Okay, I'll sign it!

18:20.647 --> 18:25.318
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

18:28.756 --> 18:30.490
You may have gone
to Cambridge,

18:30.491 --> 18:33.543
but I'm an honorary graduate
of Starfleet Academy.

18:47.096 --> 18:49.264
Good morning, Amy.

18:51.634 --> 18:55.370
It most assuredly is not.

18:55.371 --> 18:58.807
Are you experiencing
dehydration, headache,

18:58.808 --> 19:01.977
nausea and shame?

19:01.978 --> 19:03.845
Yes.

19:03.846 --> 19:06.114
I also found a Korean man's
business card

19:06.115 --> 19:08.517
tucked into my cleavage.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.819
What happened last night?

19:10.820 --> 19:12.721
Ah, memory impairment;

19:12.722 --> 19:17.326
the free prize at the bottom
of every vodka bottle.

19:17.327 --> 19:18.460
Sheldon?

19:18.461 --> 19:19.595
All right.

19:19.596 --> 19:23.198
Last night you gave me
some excellent advice

19:23.199 --> 19:24.566
regarding my problem here
at home,

19:24.567 --> 19:29.004
you kissed me and then vomited
on and off for 40 minutes,

19:29.005 --> 19:32.808
following which you passed out
on your bathroom floor.

19:32.809 --> 19:35.911
I then folded a towel under
your head as a pillow,

19:35.912 --> 19:37.846
set your oven clock
to the correct time

19:37.847 --> 19:40.315
because it was
driving me crazy...

19:41.184 --> 19:42.818
...and I left.

19:42.819 --> 19:45.988
Okay.

19:45.989 --> 19:49.591
Don't really know
where we go from here.

19:50.426 --> 19:52.261
I suggest
we treat our relationship

19:52.262 --> 19:54.429
as if it were
a crashed computer

19:54.430 --> 19:58.033
and restore it to the last point
we both agree it worked.

19:58.034 --> 20:00.402
Terrific. Thank you.

20:01.971 --> 20:03.705
They were out of menthols!

20:03.706 --> 20:05.507
Get off my back!

20:08.711 --> 20:11.847
Not easy living with a
temperamental little primate.

20:11.848 --> 20:14.283
Come on, Priya,
just admit I embarrass you!

20:14.284 --> 20:15.584
You're preaching
to the choir, sister.
