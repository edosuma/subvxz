00:46.338 --> 00:50.007
- When does it open?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.218
Well, let's get up a party in the evening,

00:52.302 --> 00:54.804
if Mrs Hughes lets us,
after we've had our dinner.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.766
You're right. It doesn't come often,
and it doesn't stay long.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.311
- And what about you, Mr Bates?
- I don't see why not.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.356
ANNA: Well, there's Lady Mary.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.443
You go on ahead.
I'll see you back at the house.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.319
GWEN: Right you are, then.

01:10.446 --> 01:14.532
Good day, my lady. Is her ladyship all right?

01:15.325 --> 01:17.368
Has she recovered from...

01:19.496 --> 01:22.498
lfyou think she'll ever recover
from carrying the body of Mr Pamuk

01:22.624 --> 01:26.627
from one side ofthe house to the other,
then you don't know her at all.

01:26.712 --> 01:32.216
Well, I didn't mean recover exactly,
just get past it.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.010
She won't do that, either.

01:34.136 --> 01:38.556
When she dies, they'll cut her open
and find it engraved on her heart.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.517
What about you?

01:42.019 --> 01:43.936
What about your heart?

01:44.605 --> 01:49.609
Haven't you heard? I don't have a heart.
Everyone knows that.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.111
Not me, my lady.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.200
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:59.620 --> 02:01.788
You wanted to see
the new chauffeur, my lord?

02:01.872 --> 02:04.290
Yes, indeed. Please send him in.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.004
Come in, come in. Good to see you again.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.548
- Branson, isn't it?
- That's right, your lordship.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.050
I hope they've shown you
where everything is

02:14.134 --> 02:16.511
and we've delivered whatever
we promised at the interview.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.012
Certainly, my lord.

02:18.096 --> 02:22.141
- Won't you miss Ireland?
- Ireland, yes. But not the job.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.519
The mistress was a nice lady,
but she had only one car

02:24.603 --> 02:27.271
and she wouldn't let me drive it
over 20 miles an hour.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.524
So it was a bit...

02:29.608 --> 02:31.567
Well, boring, so to speak.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.735
(CHUCKLES)

02:33.904 --> 02:35.488
You've got a wonderful library.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.368
You're very welcome to borrow books,
ifyou wish.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.494
Really, my lord?

02:41.578 --> 02:45.331
Well, there's a ledger over there that I make
everyone use, even my daughters.

02:45.415 --> 02:49.001
Carson and Mrs Hughes
sometimes take a novel or two.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.629
- What are your interests?
- History and politics, mainly.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.631
Heavens!

02:55.092 --> 02:57.260
Carson, Branson is going
to borrow some books.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.763
- He has my permission.
- Very good, my lord.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.599
- BRANSON: Is that all, my lord?
- It is.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.269
Offyou go and good luck.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.570
He seems a bright spark
after poor old Taylor.

03:15.654 --> 03:19.115
And to think Taylor's gone off
to run a tea shop.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.077
I cannot feel it will make
for a very restful retirement, can you?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.621
I would rather be put to death, my lord.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.543
Quite so. Thank you, Carson.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.255
How about some house parties?

03:34.339 --> 03:37.216
She's been asked to one next month
by Lady Anne McNair.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.887
A most terrible idea.
She doesn't know anyone under 100.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.307
I might send her over to visit my aunt.
She could get to know New York.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.560
Oh, I don't think things
are quite that desperate.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.646
Poor Mary,
she's been terribly down in the mouth lately.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.691
She was very upset
by the death of poor Mr Pamuk.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.652
Why? She didn't know him.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.697
One can't go to pieces at the death
ofevery foreigner.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.492
We'd all be in a state ofcollapse
whenever we opened a newspaper.

04:04.536 --> 04:11.375
Oh, no. Ofcourse, Mary's main difficulty is
that her situation is unresolved.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.587
I mean, is she an heiress or isn't she?

04:14.671 --> 04:17.423
The entail's unbreakable.
Mary cannot inherit.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.717
No, what we need is a lawyer

04:19.801 --> 04:22.595
who's decent and honour bound
to look into it.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.517
I... I think perhaps I knowjust the man.

MATTHEW: Are you going
to the fair while it's here?

04:32.648 --> 04:36.859
Oh, I shouldn't think so, sir.
But I don't mind it. I like the music.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.654
Goodness, what's happened to your hands?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.280
It's nothing, ma'am.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.074
They look very painful.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.785
Oh, no, ma'am. Irritating more than painful.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.580
Have you been using anything new
to polish the silver or the shoes?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.540
- No.
- May I?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.793
Leave him alone, Mother.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.969
It looks like Erysipelas.
You must have cut yourself.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.305
- Not that I'm aware of.
- We'll walk round to the hospital tomorrow.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.557

- I insist.

You've got a cold. I want you out of here.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.949
Anna, there you are.
You know I'm out tonight?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.410
Because I don't want to come home
to any surprises.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.412
(LAUGHING) That'll be the day.

05:30.122 --> 05:34.083
We thought we might go to the fair later.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Daisy?

05:34.543 --> 05:36.002
Now, you ought to go.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.963
She's been that down in the mouth
since the death of poor Mr Pamuk.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.548
- Don't say that.
- Well, she has.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.801
We could all walk down together
after the servants' dinner, ifthat's a good...

You won't be walking anywhere.
She's got minutes to live, by the sound of it.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.894
- Go to bed at once.
- Yes, Mrs Hughes.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.231
I'll bring up a Beechams Powder.

05:57.315 --> 06:01.360
Right. Lfthere's anything you want to ask me,
it'll need to be before I go.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.446
What would I want to ask you?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.032
I'm preparing a meal for
Lord and Lady Grantham and the girls.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.200
No one is visiting. No one is staying.

06:09.161 --> 06:12.121
Well, that's settled, then.

06:15.834 --> 06:20.171
I'm afraid Dr Clarkson's out delivering a baby.
We don't know when he'll be back.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.548
No matter.
Lfyou'll just open the store cupboard,

06:22.632 --> 06:24.884
- I can easily find what I need.
- Well, I...

06:24.968 --> 06:26.886
You can tell the doctor
that you opened the cupboard

06:26.970 --> 06:28.304
for the chairman ofthe board.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.515
I assure you,
he will raise not the slightest objection.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.021
This should do it.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.483
Tincture ofsteel, 10 drops in water,
three times a day.

06:43.028 --> 06:47.782
And this is solution of nitrate ofsilver.
Rub a little in, morning and night.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.827
- How long before it's better?
- Erysipelas is very hard to cure.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.872
We should be able to reduce the symptoms,
but that might be all we can manage.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.625
Oh, and you must wear gloves at all times.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.920
I couldn't wait a table in gloves.

- I'd look like a footman.
- You may have to.

Easier said than done.

07:34.704 --> 07:38.040
Perhaps with a flower
or a bit ofveil or something.

07:38.125 --> 07:42.211
I can find you a veil ifyou like.
I hope you're not expecting me to do it.

- Good.

What, all three ofthem? I'm not an octopus.
Why can't Gwen do it?

07:57.394 --> 07:59.520
Because she is not a lady's maid.

believe you wish to inherit

who will suffer most from a discovery.

- A swivel chair.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.520
Not very modern.
They were invented by Thomas Jefferson.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.106

involve a fight with an American?

- I'll fetch a different one.
- No, no, no, no.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.432
Yes?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.481
Well, you've cheered up a bit.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.485
He's so agile, isn't he?
He could have been a sportsman.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.112
- Who?
- Thomas, ofcourse.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.448
Really?

13:44.866 --> 13:47.367
Which sport did you have in mind?

13:49.245 --> 13:53.499
I ran into Cousin Matthew in the village.
He wanted to call on you after dinner.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.918
Apparently, Granny's been to see him.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.836
Did you tell him
she's coming here this evening?

13:57.921 --> 13:59.755
I didn't know she was.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.050
When he arrives, do your best
to keep her in the drawing room.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.801

why would you want to go to a real school?

You're not a doctor's daughter.

But nobody learns anything
from a governess,

14:39.462 --> 14:42.172
apart from French and how to curtsey.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.175

14:45.343 --> 14:46.552
SYBIL: Well, there's...

14:46.636 --> 14:48.887
Or are you thinking of a career in banking?

14:48.972 --> 14:52.057
SYBIL: No, but it is a noble profession.

14:52.141 --> 14:56.687
CORA: Things are different in America.

they go to school.

So, what did you say to Mama?

16:13.264 --> 16:17.392
I haven't spoken to her since her visit.
But I have looked through every source

16:17.477 --> 16:21.229
and I can't find one reason
on which to base a challenge.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.649
I could have told you that.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.861
I'm not quite sure how to phrase it
when I tell her.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.572
She shouldn't have put you
on the spot like that. It was unkind.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.534
I'm afraid she'll think I've failed
because I don't want to succeed.

16:34.619 --> 16:38.497
She will think that, but I don't,
and nor will Cora.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.417
Ofcourse it's impossible for Mary.
She must resent me so bitterly.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.003
And I don't blame her.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.925
Yes, it must have been hard for you

Do you see much of him?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.515

16:56.599 --> 16:58.809
I would have given him a share
ofthe farm if he wanted it,

16:58.893 --> 17:01.144
but he's joined the army.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.814
- Well, I never.
- Oh, he seems happy.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.066
But it's left me on me own.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.360

30:43.842 --> 30:48.846
The only one who never sticks up for me
in all this is you. Why is that?

30:48.931 --> 30:52.058
You are my darling daughter and I love you,

30:52.434 --> 30:55.311
hard as it is for an Englishman
to say the words.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.979
Well, then...

30:57.105 --> 31:00.441
If I had made my own fortune
and bought Downton for myself,

31:00.567 --> 31:03.945
it should be yours without question,
but I did not.

31:05.280 --> 31:10.076
My fortune is the work ofothers,
who laboured to build a great dynasty.

31:11.286 --> 31:16.958
Do I have the right to destroy their work?
Or impoverish that dynasty?

31:19.628 --> 31:22.296
I am a custodian, my dear, not an owner.

31:24.758 --> 31:27.760
I must strive to be worthy ofthe task
I have been set.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.681
If I could take Mama's money
out ofthe estate,

31:31.807 --> 31:35.768
Downton would have to be sold to pay for it.
Is that what you want?

31:35.852 --> 31:40.147
To see Matthew a landless pier with a title
but no means to pay for it?

31:40.274 --> 31:43.859
So I'm to just find a husband
and get out ofthe way?

31:44.319 --> 31:49.532
- You could stay here ifyou married Matthew.
- You know my character, Father.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.660
I'd never marry any man that I was told to.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.831
I'm stubborn. I wish I wasn't, but I am.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.854
Will you have your own way, do you think?
With the frock?

32:21.481 --> 32:23.691
Only I couldn't help overhearing yesterday,

32:23.817 --> 32:28.154
and from what her ladyship said,
it sounded as ifyou support women's rights.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.864
I suppose I do.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.492
Because I'm quite political.

32:33.577 --> 32:38.831
In fact, I've brought some pamphlets that
I thought might interest you, about the vote.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.249
Thank you.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.338
But please don't mention this to my father,
or my grandmother.

32:45.422 --> 32:49.550
One whiffof reform
and she hears the rattle ofthe guillotine.

32:51.053 --> 32:54.221
It seems rather unlikely,
a revolutionary chauffeur.

32:54.931 --> 32:58.851
Maybe.
But I'm a socialist, not a revolutionary.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.063
And I won't always be a chauffeur.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.987
Mrs Crawley, how nice.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.199
- You're busy. We can come back later.
- Molesley?

33:13.283 --> 33:15.785
What are you doing here? Are you ill?

33:16.411 --> 33:19.205
Poor Mr Molesley. How's it going?

33:19.289 --> 33:21.248
The solution doesn't seem
to make it any better.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.959
My imagination is running riot.

33:25.128 --> 33:29.799
- I've got Erysipelas, your ladyship.
- Oh, I am sorry.

33:30.300 --> 33:35.262
Mrs Crawley tells me she's recommended
nitrate ofsilver and tincture ofsteel.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.723
Is she making a suit of armour?

33:37.808 --> 33:41.936
- But I take it there's been no improvement?
- Not really.

33:42.688 --> 33:48.442
- And you're sure it's Erysipelas?
- That is Mrs Crawley's diagnosis.

33:48.944 --> 33:52.780
- What it is to have medical knowledge!
- It has its uses.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.448
Mmm.

33:55.617 --> 33:58.577
I see your father
has been making changes at home.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.789
He has, my lady. He's got no use
for the herb garden now me mother's gone,

34:01.873 --> 34:02.915
so he's turned it to grass.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.918
- And you've been helping him?
- I have.

34:06.002 --> 34:11.215
- Grubbing out the old rue hedge?
- How did you know that?

34:11.299 --> 34:15.720
Because this is not Erysipelas,
this is a rue allergy.

34:17.139 --> 34:20.224
If Molesley wears gardening gloves,
it'll be gone in a week.

34:21.476 --> 34:25.312
Please don't think we're ungrateful
for your enthusiasm, Mrs Crawley,

34:25.397 --> 34:29.650
but there comes a time when things
are best left to the professionals.

34:30.485 --> 34:34.405
- But I...
- And now, really, I really must go.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.491
- Good day.
- Thank you, your ladyship.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.993
(CHUCKLING)

34:46.334 --> 34:48.669
I hope Cousin Violet
has recovered from last night.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.672
Whatever she says,
my mother is as strong as an ox,

34:51.757 --> 34:56.677
and it's high time she let go of her scheme
for upsetting everything. Time we all did.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.388
I can't deny I'm pleased to hear it.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.932
Are you beginning to see a future here, then?

35:02.017 --> 35:04.185
In a way, this latest business
has forced me to recognise

35:04.269 --> 35:07.062
that I do want Downton to be my future.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.815
I'm glad.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.568
You must have thought me
an awful prig when I first arrived.

35:12.694 --> 35:13.903
Not a prig.

35:14.029 --> 35:17.448
Just a man thrust into something
he never wanted or envisaged.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.909
I could only see the absurdity
ofthe whole thing.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.244
- I'm sorry.
- Well, there are absurdities involved,

35:22.329 --> 35:23.913
as I know well enough.

35:23.997 --> 35:30.169
Possibilities, too, and I was blind to them.
I was determined not to let it change me.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.422
- It was absurd. Lfyou don't change, you die.
- Do you think so?

35:33.507 --> 35:36.634
I'm not sure. Sometimes I think I hate change.

35:36.718 --> 35:40.721
Well, at least we can comfort ourselves
that this will still be here.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.640
Because we saved it.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.395
DAISY: Thomas is lovely, isn't he?

35:49.439 --> 35:52.107
He's funny and handsome,

35:52.734 --> 35:56.111
- and he's got such lovely teeth.
- He's not for you, Daisy.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.031
Ofcourse not.
He's too good for me, I know that.

35:59.115 --> 36:03.202
- No. He's not too good.
- What, then?

36:03.286 --> 36:07.456
He's not the boy for you,
and you're not the girl for him.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.501
Isn't that what I just said?

36:11.962 --> 36:13.796
And why would he be?

36:13.880 --> 36:19.134
When he's seen and done so much,
and I've been nowhere and done nothing.

36:19.970 --> 36:23.222
Perhaps Thomas has seen and done
more than is good for him.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.560
He's not a ladies' man.

36:28.812 --> 36:34.358
- Well, isn't it a blessed relief?
- Daisy, Thomas is a troubled soul.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.112
I don't know what you mean, Mrs Patmore.

36:39.364 --> 36:43.701
Oh, nothing. I don't mean anything.

36:44.536 --> 36:49.331
Except, if I don't get the ice cream started,
they'll be dining at midnight.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.339
Golly, my corset's tight.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.759
Anna, when you've done that,
would you be an angel and loosen it a bit?

37:00.844 --> 37:04.805
- The start ofthe slippery slope.
- I'm not putting on weight.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.473
It didn't shrink in the drawer.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.602
Are you coming down?

37:09.686 --> 37:11.979
I don't know why we bother with corsets.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.982
Men don't wear them, and they look
perfectly normal in their clothes.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.651
- Not all ofthem.
- She's just showing off.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.486
She'll be on about the vote in a minute.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.406
Lfyou mean do I think women
should have the vote, ofcourse I do.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.200
I hope you won't chain yourself
to the railings

37:25.285 --> 37:27.244
and end up being force-fed semolina.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.205
What do you think, Anna?

37:30.290 --> 37:33.542
- I think those women are very brave.
- Hear, hear.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.880
ROBERT: How did you get on
with your dressmaker?

37:37.964 --> 37:39.924
- Find anything?
- I did.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.010
And she says she can have it done by Friday.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.638
I'm sorry I couldn't come,
but I didn't want to put Matthew off.

37:47.057 --> 37:49.266
EDITH: Were you pleased
with the work on the cottages?

37:49.351 --> 37:51.185
ROBERT: I think they're making
a very good job ofthem.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.937
You must all go and see.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.064
CORA: You'll restore a few
every year from now on?

37:55.732 --> 37:58.233
It was Matthew's idea.

37:58.318 --> 38:01.570
Old Cripps was rather reluctant,
but I'm pleased we went forward.

38:01.655 --> 38:04.657
EDITH: I suppose it's worth it?
SYBIL: Ofcourse it is.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.742
Because ofthe people who'll live in them.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.577
You'll be glad to hear
that Matthew's conscience

38:08.662 --> 38:10.454
is much more energetic than mine.

38:10.538 --> 38:13.415
Lfyou'll excuse me, I'm going to bed.
I've rather a headache.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.377
Ofcourse. Shall I bring you
something for it?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.629
No. I'll be perfectly fine, if I can just lie down.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.174
Mary?

38:25.428 --> 38:27.012
(MARY SOBBING)

38:28.598 --> 38:30.182
Oh, my darling.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.602
What is it?

38:35.355 --> 38:41.235
You heard him. Matthew this, Matthew that.
Matthew, Matthew, Matthew!

38:43.446 --> 38:47.449
Oh, Mother, don't you see?
He has a son now.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.494
Ofcourse he didn't argue with the entail.
Why would he?

38:50.578 --> 38:52.621
When he's got what he always wanted.

38:52.706 --> 38:57.334
- Your father loves you very much.
- He wouldn't fight for me, though.

38:57.419 --> 39:01.213
He wouldn't fight for you
because he knew he couldn't win.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.426
- You're no better.
- What?

39:05.510 --> 39:07.177
You don't care about
Matthew getting everything,

39:07.262 --> 39:09.138
because you don't think I'm worthy of it.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.890
- Mary!
- I wish you'd just admit it.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.976
I'm a lost soul to you.

39:14.060 --> 39:17.479
I took a lover with no thought of marriage,
a Turk!

39:18.815 --> 39:20.983
Think ofthat! Oh, my dear!

39:27.365 --> 39:31.618
Don't worry, Mama. You can go down now.

39:32.412 --> 39:35.748
Everything will look better in the morning.
Isn't that what you usually say?

39:38.001 --> 39:40.377
I say it because it's usually true.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.255
Papa will wonder where you are.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.268
- Don't quarrel with Matthew.
- Why shouldn't I?

39:57.437 --> 39:59.813
Because one day you may need him.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.734
Oh, I see.

40:04.402 --> 40:08.822
When I've ruined myself, I must have
a powerful protector to hide behind.

40:43.525 --> 40:48.487
I'd tell you off, but I like to hear you play.

40:50.824 --> 40:54.201
- Where are they all?
- Busy, I suppose.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.371
Haven't you got anything to do?

40:58.540 --> 41:01.792
Yes, I have. Ofcourse I have.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.464
You mustn't let Thomas get you down.

41:07.549 --> 41:10.884
He's justjealous.
Everyone likes you better than him.

41:12.053 --> 41:13.470
Not everyone.

41:13.555 --> 41:16.974
Then she's a foolish girl
and she doesn't deserve you.

41:17.058 --> 41:18.976
Though why am I encouraging you?

41:19.060 --> 41:22.354
Forget all that. For 10 years, at least.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.482
You're a kind woman, Mrs Hughes.

41:25.567 --> 41:29.903
I don't know how this house
would run without you. I don't, truly.

41:31.406 --> 41:35.993
Stop flannelling and get on,
before I betray you to Mr Carson.

42:10.945 --> 42:14.239
Oh, is there anything
more thrilling than a new frock?

42:14.324 --> 42:15.782
I suppose not, my lady.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.620
You shall have one, too.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.998
I thought this would be suitable
for your interview.

42:23.124 --> 42:26.376
- I won't be wearing it, my lady.
- Ofcourse you will.

42:26.461 --> 42:30.130
We have to make you look like
a successful, professional woman.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.967
What is it? What's happened?

42:35.637 --> 42:38.430
Well, I won't wear it because I'm not going.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.809
They've cancelled the appointment.

42:43.478 --> 42:47.814
They've found someone
more suited for the post and better qualified.

42:47.941 --> 42:50.150
- This time.
- Let's face it.

42:51.653 --> 42:55.489
There'll never be anyone less suited
for the post or worse qualified than I am.

42:55.615 --> 42:57.199
That isn't true.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.995
You'll see, we're not giving up.

43:02.664 --> 43:05.958
No one hits the bull's eye with the first arrow.

43:11.881 --> 43:15.676
I've put out the Rundell candlesticks
for dinner tonight.

43:17.136 --> 43:21.682
- Oh. I'm sorry, I'll come back later.
- No. Stay, please.

43:22.725 --> 43:27.187
I've got something I'd like to talk
to you about, ifyou've a minute.

43:36.531 --> 43:41.368
Before I first came here as head housemaid,
I was walking out with a farmer.

43:44.205 --> 43:48.417
When I told him I'd taken a job at Downton,
he asked me to marry him.

43:48.543 --> 43:52.337
I was a farmer's daughterfrom Argyll,
so I knewthe life.

43:53.548 --> 43:58.885
He was very nice,
but then I came here and I did well and...

43:59.012 --> 44:04.558
I didn't want to give it up. So I told him no,
and he married someone else.

44:06.019 --> 44:08.687
She died three years ago.

44:08.771 --> 44:12.441
And last month he wrote,
asking to see me again.

44:14.235 --> 44:17.904
And I agreed.
Because all this time, I've wondered.

44:18.448 --> 44:19.656
Go on.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.410
I met him the other night.

44:24.329 --> 44:27.831
We had dinner at the Grantham Arms
and after, he took me to the fair.

44:27.915 --> 44:31.668
And he was horrible and fat and red-faced,

44:31.753 --> 44:34.629
and you couldn't think
what you ever saw in him.

44:34.756 --> 44:38.508
He was still a nice man. He is still a nice man.

44:39.761 --> 44:46.350
Well, he was a bit red-faced and his suit
was a little tight, but none ofthat matters.

44:46.434 --> 44:48.393
In the real ways,

44:48.478 --> 44:50.479
he hadn't changed.

44:50.605 --> 44:54.983
And he proposed again and you accepted?

44:57.779 --> 44:59.279
(INAUDIBLE)

45:07.121 --> 45:10.123
MRS HUGHES: In many ways,
I wanted to accept.

45:12.627 --> 45:15.212
But I'm not that farm girl any more.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.633
I was flattered, ofcourse, but...

45:21.886 --> 45:24.137
I've changed, Mr Carson.

45:26.808 --> 45:30.018
Life's altered you, as it's altered me.

45:30.728 --> 45:35.190
And what would be the point of living
ifwe didn't let life change us?

45:38.653 --> 45:40.487
You won't be leaving, then?

45:43.491 --> 45:44.533
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

45:45.827 --> 45:48.495
You'd better come.
Mrs Patmore's on the rampage.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.038
She wants the key to the store cupboard.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.165
You know how angry she gets
she hasn't got one of her own.

45:52.250 --> 45:55.669
Nor will she have.
Not while I'm housekeeper here.

45:56.546 --> 46:00.257
Leaving? When would I ever find the time?

46:00.341 --> 46:02.551
(MRS PATMORE COMPLAINING)

46:09.892 --> 46:12.144
Whatever is holding Sybil up?

46:12.228 --> 46:14.354
She was going on about her new frock.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.241
We'd better go in without her,
