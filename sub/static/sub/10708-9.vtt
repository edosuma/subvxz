And...

16:29.152 --> 16:31.909
I think I should be the one to tell Amy.

16:32.489 --> 16:33.939
What? Why?

16:33.964 --> 16:36.227
'Cause you two have been
through so much this year

16:36.927 --> 16:38.248
and there's a very high probability

16:38.273 --> 16:40.638
she's gonna shoot the messenger, so...

16:40.776 --> 16:42.932
let me be the messenger.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.910
But won't that ruin
your chances with Amy?

thinking a lot about that

17:12.281 --> 17:15.932

talking about it with you.

about what sex with you means.

It's embarrassing, but
I had this dumb idea

that someone was gonna

No, no, no. W-we should.

Wait, what? What's happening?

18:17.459 --> 18:18.751
Oh, my God.

18:18.776 --> 18:20.967
One of the New Lisbeths
posted that pic of us

18:47.944 --> 18:49.327
I thought about what you said

18:49.357 --> 18:51.212
and I can do better.

18:51.322 --> 18:52.938
I asked Ron to leave.

18:52.963 --> 18:55.006

him to drum up business

18:55.031 --> 18:56.313
