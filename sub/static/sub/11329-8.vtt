WEBVTT

00:00.269 --> 00:03.538
? ger...

00:03.572 --> 00:05.172
You started flirting with me

00:05.207 --> 00:06.908
long before I started flirting back.

00:08.544 --> 00:10.011
I just came to say goodbye.

00:10.045 --> 00:13.548
I violated my parole, and
I have to turn myself in.

00:13.582 --> 00:15.182
And we're gonna go to
New York, just you and me,

00:15.217 --> 00:17.084
and you're gonna see Amy,
and you're gonna tell her.

00:17.119 --> 00:20.121
Is it so hard for you to believe
that Ricky has feelings for me?

00:20.155 --> 00:21.556
Stay away from Ricky.

00:21.590 --> 00:24.025
I'm not even used to the
idea, and I'm your best friend.

00:24.059 --> 00:27.161
Well, get used to it 'cause I'm
having a baby, and I'm happy about it.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.529
She decided to keep the baby.

00:28.564 --> 00:31.165
That's it. I
hired her for the day.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.602
I'd hire her for longer if she
didn't already have plans. She's good.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.571
If Lauren doesn't have
Madison to talk to,

00:36.605 --> 00:38.205
you're gonna get a lot of action.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.440
Did you know you were living here?

00:39.474 --> 00:40.541
Temporarily.

00:40.576 --> 00:42.109
I told you you can't live here.

00:42.144 --> 00:44.512
Tom really wanted me to
move into the guest house.

00:49.585 --> 00:51.719
Amy, Adrian's pregnant,
and it's my baby.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.298 --> 01:06.100
Come on. Pick up!

01:06.134 --> 01:08.669
We're all worried about you, Amy.
You pick up that phone right now!

01:08.704 --> 01:10.705
Right now, young lady!
That's not gonna work.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.673
Well, what is gonna work? Nothing.

01:12.708 --> 01:14.642
She's clearly not talking to any of us.

01:14.676 --> 01:16.043
No. She's talking to some of us.

01:16.078 --> 01:18.079
She's talking to you?
She wouldn't talk to her.

01:18.113 --> 01:20.915
Well, I didn't call her.
And I'm not going to call her

01:20.949 --> 01:23.184
until she grows up,
and maybe not even then.

01:23.218 --> 01:25.453
Well, so who's Amy talking to? Ricky?

01:25.487 --> 01:27.722
No, not Ricky. Why
would she talk to Ricky?

01:27.756 --> 01:29.757
Ricky knew. Ricky didn't tell her.

01:29.791 --> 01:31.626
Why would she talk to him?
'Cause he's John's father.

01:31.660 --> 01:34.395
Oh! She's talking to John. Go get John.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.997
Maybe if we get John
on the phone with her,

01:36.031 --> 01:38.132
she'll talk to John, and then we
can get in on the conversation.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.200
Trick her? Yeah.

01:39.234 --> 01:41.102
Now you're catching on to parenting.

01:43.572 --> 01:45.773
When did you two start
scheming together?

01:48.043 --> 01:48.909
Oh, God.

01:48.944 --> 01:51.012
I think I'm finally coming around

01:51.046 --> 01:52.146
to liking your father again.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.683
Well, don't rush into
anything. Take your time.

01:55.717 --> 01:58.285
You know, you may like him
now, but when you two grow up,

01:58.320 --> 01:59.887
you may not like each other at all.

01:59.921 --> 02:02.289
Maybe the three of us could
scheme together this time.

02:02.324 --> 02:04.659
Maybe the three of us can find out a way

02:04.693 --> 02:06.661
to get Amy on the phone
to see if she's okay.

02:06.695 --> 02:09.130
You want in? No, I don't want in.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.032
And are you sure you want in?

02:11.066 --> 02:13.200
You have to take a step back and
really look at the relationship.

02:13.235 --> 02:15.936
Decide with your head if
you want to scheme with Dad,

02:15.971 --> 02:17.938
no matter what you feel in your heart.

02:17.973 --> 02:20.541
Okay, the advice that I
gave to you about Ricky

02:20.575 --> 02:23.077
does not necessarily apply
to your father and me.

02:23.111 --> 02:26.647
But if I did try to look at
the relationship objectively,

02:26.682 --> 02:29.183
and if I were deciding if it
would be the right thing to do-

02:29.217 --> 02:30.718
to be married to
your father again-

02:30.752 --> 02:33.788
then right now I'd say that
maybe it's the right thing to do.

02:33.822 --> 02:35.156
Yes! No.

02:35.190 --> 02:37.258
Too late. You said yes.

02:37.292 --> 02:39.126
No. I said if I were deciding.

02:39.161 --> 02:42.329
I'm not deciding. Not yet. It
sounded like you were deciding.

02:42.364 --> 02:44.532
No, I was thinking about deciding.

02:44.566 --> 02:48.569
I was thinking that maybe I would decide
something soon, if you're still interested.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.072
I'm still interested. Good to know.

02:54.643 --> 02:56.711
Oh, where's John? I thought
we were gonna call Amy.

02:56.745 --> 02:59.980
Ricky's still getting him ready. So?

03:00.015 --> 03:01.716
So?

03:01.750 --> 03:03.050
Sooo?

03:03.085 --> 03:04.752
Maybe.

03:04.786 --> 03:05.786
Maybe yes?

03:05.821 --> 03:07.021
Maybe yes.

03:07.055 --> 03:09.023
You think we could make
that a definitely yes?

03:09.057 --> 03:11.192
I'm feeling pretty good
about things right now.

03:11.226 --> 03:13.260
That makes me really happy, Anne.

03:13.295 --> 03:15.096
Good. I'm happy, too.

03:15.130 --> 03:17.498
Would you like to go out to
dinner tonight, just the two of us?

03:17.532 --> 03:19.200
Spend a little time
together outside of bed?

03:19.234 --> 03:21.368
Would you like to spend some
time with me outside of bed?

03:21.403 --> 03:22.837
I would.

03:22.871 --> 03:24.538
Then it's a date.

03:25.674 --> 03:27.374
I mean she'll get over it.

03:27.409 --> 03:28.976
She already knew that
they slept together,

03:29.010 --> 03:30.111
and she forgave him for that.

03:30.145 --> 03:32.780
So it can't be that big a
leap to forgive him for this.

03:32.814 --> 03:34.882
I don't know why everyone's
so concerned about it.

03:34.916 --> 03:36.751
I don't know why everyone's
so concerned either.

03:36.785 --> 03:38.853
I just know why I'm concerned about Amy.

03:38.887 --> 03:40.221
Oh? And why is that?

03:40.255 --> 03:42.022
Because she's the mother of my son.

03:42.057 --> 03:43.357
So what?

03:43.391 --> 03:46.160
So what? So she's someone I care about.

03:46.194 --> 03:48.395
She's the person I care
about most next to him.

04:05.981 --> 04:08.549
Hey, Amy. I'm sorry
about Ben and Adrian,

04:08.583 --> 04:11.652
and- and I'm sorry
about Ricky and me.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.821
I wish I had never kissed him.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.894
<i>âª Falling in love âª</i>

04:19.928 --> 04:23.264
<i>âª Is such an easy thing to do âª</i>

04:23.298 --> 04:25.933
<i>âª Birds can do it We can do it âª</i>

04:25.967 --> 04:28.569
<i>âª Let's stop talking
Let's get to it âª</i>

04:28.603 --> 04:31.138
<i>âª Let's fall in love âª</i>

04:32.152 --> 04:35.121
Yes! A date, a date, a date.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.490
Where are you taking her?
And do not say Jeff's.

04:37.524 --> 04:39.525
She likes that place. That
is not a special place.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.527
They have specials.

04:41.562 --> 04:43.630
I'll take her someplace special.

04:43.664 --> 04:45.598
Want some suggestions? No, I do not.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.601
I want this to be a night that I plan all
on my own, without any help from anyone.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.436
Sometimes when a man loves a woman,

04:50.471 --> 04:53.072
he needs a little help
from a man who loves a man.

04:53.107 --> 04:55.541
I think I know where to
take my wife to dinner.

04:55.576 --> 04:57.910
Ex-wife. Ex, ex, ex, ex, ex.

05:00.147 --> 05:01.247
Lonzo's.

05:01.282 --> 05:03.182
That's not even as nice as Jeff's.

05:03.217 --> 05:04.384
For a thousand bucks, you can get them

05:04.418 --> 05:06.219
to close the back
room for the night-

05:06.253 --> 05:08.588
Well, I can get them to close
the back room for the night.

05:08.622 --> 05:11.524
Then you can have the place
just for the two of you.

05:11.558 --> 05:12.759
A thousand-dollar dinner?

05:12.793 --> 05:14.127
No, you still have to pay for dinner.

05:14.161 --> 05:18.097
Look, Lonzo's back room is fantastic.

05:18.132 --> 05:19.365
It's tiny.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.669
It's a tiny little place
that is so romantic.

05:22.703 --> 05:25.204
And the food is very, very good.

05:25.239 --> 05:27.774
And the wine- The wine
selection is to die for.

05:27.808 --> 05:29.042
How much is that gonna cost me?

05:29.076 --> 05:30.843
What's the cost of losing her now?

05:33.213 --> 05:34.514
Oh, it's Anne.

05:34.548 --> 05:36.416
Hello.

05:36.450 --> 05:39.419
Hi. Hi. What's up?

05:39.453 --> 05:41.587
I was just calling to make sure
that we're still going out to dinner.

05:41.622 --> 05:43.089
If we're not going out to dinner,

05:43.123 --> 05:44.590
I need to pick up something
to cook here at home.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.492
I'm making plans right now. Oh?

05:46.527 --> 05:49.429
Yeah. Are you getting help from Donovan?

05:49.463 --> 05:50.863
Yes, I'm getting some help from Donovan,

05:50.898 --> 05:52.498
so you know it's gonna be good.

05:52.533 --> 05:55.401
<i>Well, it doesn't have to
be that good- Donovan good.</i>

05:55.436 --> 05:57.470
<i>Oh, my- It's not
a special occasion.</i>

05:57.504 --> 05:59.839
We're just having a meal
together outside of the house.

05:59.873 --> 06:02.075
Just the two of us. We can go anywhere.

06:02.109 --> 06:04.410
No, no, no. It's gotta be
good. I want it to be good.

06:04.445 --> 06:07.113
It's just not gonna be
special or fancy, just good.

06:07.147 --> 06:08.648
Okay. So I can dress casual?

06:08.682 --> 06:10.516
Yep. How's 6:00?

06:10.551 --> 06:12.452
6:00 in the evening? No.

06:12.486 --> 06:13.486
7:00.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
8:00. 8:00.

06:14.555 --> 06:16.289
8:00 is fine, George.

06:16.323 --> 06:18.958
We go any later than 8, I'll fall
asleep before the main course.

06:18.992 --> 06:21.160
8:00 it is. I'll see you then.

06:21.195 --> 06:22.628
I'll make the call.

06:22.663 --> 06:24.897
Oh, wait. A thousand bucks?

06:24.932 --> 06:26.799
They won't shut it down for
less than a thousand bucks?

06:26.834 --> 06:28.234
Would you quit worrying?

06:28.268 --> 06:30.536
You know how much we made
off that Web site last month.

06:30.571 --> 06:32.004
So take it and spend it on Anne.

06:32.039 --> 06:34.507
It was her idea in the
first place, wasn't it?

06:34.541 --> 06:36.542
So spend it on her.

06:36.577 --> 06:37.577
Show a little appreciation

06:37.611 --> 06:39.645
for all the things she's done for you.

06:42.816 --> 06:45.451
Oh, dear God, George, you did tell her.

06:46.553 --> 06:48.354
It was her idea.

06:48.389 --> 06:50.790
You can't make money just
thinking about things.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.258
You actually have to go out there

06:52.292 --> 06:53.626
and do something with those ideas.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.794
I got out there, and I did something.

06:54.828 --> 06:56.562
With your ex-wife's ideas.

06:58.465 --> 07:01.100
Jared, it's Donovan.
I have an emergency.

07:01.135 --> 07:03.236
I need the back room for tonight.

07:03.270 --> 07:05.605
No, it's not
for me, you big silly.

07:05.639 --> 07:08.174
It's for George.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.009
Yes. That one.

07:11.445 --> 07:13.546
I called her, and I've
left text and emails,

07:13.580 --> 07:15.415
but I don't want to seem too pushy.

07:15.449 --> 07:18.251
Well, that's your problem.
You're not pushy enough.

07:18.285 --> 07:20.286
You went all the way to New
York to tell her about Adrian.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.855
The least she could do is
answer your texts and emails.

07:22.890 --> 07:25.458
Try her again. Hey,
did you hear from Amy?

07:25.492 --> 07:26.492
No.

07:26.527 --> 07:28.561
I was asking him.

07:28.595 --> 07:30.096
I know. I was answering for him.

07:30.130 --> 07:32.064
Ben can answer for himself.

07:32.099 --> 07:33.533
Hey, just because you're having his baby

07:33.567 --> 07:35.668
doesn't me he still can't
go back with my sister.

07:35.702 --> 07:37.303
Oh, I knew you were thinking that.

07:37.337 --> 07:39.705
So what? What if I am thinking that?

07:39.740 --> 07:41.040
You're not in love with Ben.

07:41.074 --> 07:44.844
You and Ben are just... parents.

07:45.746 --> 07:47.713
Uh, awkward.

07:47.748 --> 07:50.249
Your sister isn't even speaking to Ben,

07:50.284 --> 07:52.919
so he can go out with Grace if
he wants to go out with Grace.

07:52.953 --> 07:54.720
Oh, please. That's
ridiculous, isn't it, Ben?

07:55.856 --> 07:56.956
No, it's not.

07:56.990 --> 07:58.424
I'm beginning to feel part of

07:58.459 --> 08:00.793
a dating matrix that's
never been explored before.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.663
Well, then, get Amy to talk to
you so you can stop exploring.

08:03.697 --> 08:05.398
Maybe he doesn't want to stop exploring.

08:05.432 --> 08:08.501
Yes, he does. He does if he
knows what's good for him and Amy.

08:08.535 --> 08:09.702
He flew all the way to New York.

08:09.736 --> 08:12.371
He tried, okay? And now he
wants to go out with Grace.

08:16.143 --> 08:18.911
You can't seriously be trying
to get Ben to date Grace.

08:18.946 --> 08:21.414
Yes, I can. It's no different

08:21.448 --> 08:23.649
than Ben and Amy getting together
when she was having Ricky's baby.

08:23.684 --> 08:25.418
Yes, it is.

08:25.452 --> 08:27.086
Besides, Grace belongs with Jack.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.754
You know she'll end up with Jack.

08:28.789 --> 08:30.456
He's living at her guest house.

08:30.491 --> 08:32.658
Speak of the devil.

08:32.693 --> 08:34.693
What's going on? I feel some tension.

08:34.727 --> 08:36.596
There shouldn't be any
tension. It's Friday.

08:36.630 --> 08:38.831
Almost Friday night. Date night.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.799
What, are you guys having
an argument or something?

08:42.568 --> 08:43.970
Really? It involves me somehow?

08:44.004 --> 08:45.104
No.

08:46.940 --> 08:48.875
It's not an argument that involves you.

08:48.909 --> 08:51.844
It involves Amy and Ben and not Grace.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.914
I think I know why you don't want
Ben and Grace together, Ashley.

08:54.948 --> 08:56.382
Because I want Ben with Amy.

08:56.416 --> 08:59.085
Yeah, but isn't Ben
kind of busy right now?

08:59.119 --> 09:01.487
Yes, he is. We're having a baby.

09:01.522 --> 09:04.156
And if Ben wants to, he's dating Grace.

09:04.191 --> 09:06.492
You see how ridiculous that sounds?

09:06.527 --> 09:08.060
That does sound kind of ridiculous.

09:08.095 --> 09:10.496
Anyway, Ben's in love with Amy.

09:10.531 --> 09:12.131
Not that he's not involved with you.

09:12.165 --> 09:15.234
Yeah. Involved with
you, in love with Amy.

09:15.269 --> 09:18.337
She's not even speaking to Ben.

09:18.372 --> 09:20.339
Either way, Grace needs
to find a boyfriend.

09:20.374 --> 09:22.508
I'm the one that needs
to find a boyfriend.

09:22.543 --> 09:23.576
Yeah, well...

09:23.610 --> 09:24.744
Yeah, well, what?

09:24.778 --> 09:26.045
You're having a baby.

09:26.079 --> 09:27.113
And?

09:27.147 --> 09:28.114
And nothing.

09:29.316 --> 09:30.816
There's not a lot of Bens around.

09:30.851 --> 09:34.253
Then again, Ben was
around, or is around.

09:34.288 --> 09:36.722
But then there's Amy
and, I guess, Grace,

09:36.757 --> 09:38.558
who, like I said, needs
to find a boyfriend.

09:38.592 --> 09:41.794
And like I said, I do, too.

09:44.064 --> 09:47.833
Hey. Did you tell Grace that we're
gonna be hanging out at the guest house?

09:47.868 --> 09:51.571
It sounds so cool, so adult-
"hanging out in the guest house. "

09:51.605 --> 09:53.039
Guest house.

09:53.073 --> 09:55.441
No, I didn't get a chance to tell Grace.

09:55.475 --> 09:58.144
So you two made up? Of
course. We're best friends.

09:58.178 --> 09:59.745
Yeah, but Amy's your best friend.

09:59.780 --> 10:01.480
You don't speak to
her. What's your point?

10:01.515 --> 10:04.550
That best friends don't always need
to speak to each other or be together.

10:04.585 --> 10:07.486
Well, yeah, kind of.

10:07.521 --> 10:09.188
But especially since

10:09.222 --> 10:11.557
our other best friend is
angry with the two of us,

10:11.592 --> 10:13.492
we feel a lot better hanging out.

10:13.527 --> 10:15.127
And that reminds me.

10:15.162 --> 10:17.430
Lauren and I have something
we wanted to ask you.

10:18.732 --> 10:20.466
Go on, Lauren.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.968
You go on.

10:23.337 --> 10:24.437
No, you.

10:25.606 --> 10:28.007
Hey, Lauren. Hey, Jesse.

10:28.041 --> 10:31.410
So, are we invited to
the guest house tonight?

10:34.047 --> 10:36.015
Madison, you know Tom's
not gonna be home tonight?

10:36.049 --> 10:38.284
Yeah, and I thought you wouldn't mind

10:38.318 --> 10:40.586
if I invited Jesse and
Lauren to come as well.

10:40.621 --> 10:42.822
Wasn't my idea.

10:42.856 --> 10:45.224
Look, my dad won't let me

10:45.258 --> 10:46.792
if there's not gonna
be someone else there.

10:46.827 --> 10:49.795
Why? Like these two are gonna
keep the two of us from having sex?

10:49.830 --> 10:51.163
Yeah, something like that.

10:51.198 --> 10:53.666
Oh, I didn't know
anything about chaperoning.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.637
We won't have time for
chaperoning. Don't worry.

10:57.671 --> 10:59.772
Oh, I'm not worried.

10:59.806 --> 11:01.807
Don't start, you two.

11:01.842 --> 11:03.909
Save it for tonight.

11:03.944 --> 11:06.312
You save it for tonight.

11:14.821 --> 11:16.789
Madison, I wanted to be alone with you.

11:16.823 --> 11:18.791
I want to be alone
with you, too, but-

11:18.825 --> 11:21.060
But it's not too late
to get rid of them.

11:21.094 --> 11:23.229
What if you tell your dad
they're coming, and they don't?

11:23.263 --> 11:25.965
So lie to my dad and
fool around with you?

11:27.067 --> 11:29.201
Jack, there are some limitations.

11:29.236 --> 11:31.037
Maddie, wait up.

11:37.051 --> 11:39.519
Stop calling her. Did
she tell you to say that?

11:39.553 --> 11:41.454
No, I'm telling you. Stop calling her.

11:41.489 --> 11:43.022
Amy doesn't wanna talk to anyone.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.024
The only person she's
talking to at all is John.

11:45.059 --> 11:47.760
Oh, and I'm sure John gets her
on the phone all by himself?

11:47.795 --> 11:48.995
I get her on the phone for John.

11:49.029 --> 11:50.897
Yeah, I know. I was
just pointing that out.

11:50.931 --> 11:52.832
Do you think that you could
get her on the phone for me?

11:52.867 --> 11:55.068
No, I cannot get her
on the phone for you.

11:55.102 --> 11:56.469
She's not talking to you.

11:56.504 --> 11:58.705
She's not talking to her
family or her friends.

11:58.739 --> 12:01.608
She's not talking to anyone who knew that
Adrian's having your baby and didn't tell her.

12:01.642 --> 12:03.543
She told you that? She
didn't have to tell me that.

12:03.577 --> 12:05.111
I figured it out all by myself.

12:05.145 --> 12:06.479
I shouldn't have to tell you that.

12:06.514 --> 12:08.348
You should've figured
it out all by yourself.

12:08.382 --> 12:11.184
It's killing me, okay? It's killing me.

12:11.218 --> 12:14.787
I don't care if she yells at me and tells me
that she hates me. I just want her to talk to me.

12:14.822 --> 12:17.757
When she talks to you, I'm
sure she will tell you that,

12:17.791 --> 12:19.993
but that might not be
for a long, long time.

12:20.027 --> 12:21.995
Look, take my advice.

12:22.029 --> 12:23.396
Don't aggravate the situation

12:23.430 --> 12:25.665
by calling and calling
and texting and texting

12:25.699 --> 12:28.134
and e-mailing and
whatever else you're doing.

12:28.168 --> 12:30.003
Just stop. Leave it alone.

12:30.037 --> 12:33.206
Give her some time, and
then maybe by the time

12:33.240 --> 12:35.074
this music program is over,

12:35.109 --> 12:37.677
and Amy comes home from New
York, she'll come around again.

12:37.711 --> 12:40.213
She'll come around? As
in, she'll forgive me?

12:40.247 --> 12:42.749
No, but seeing your
name on the caller ID

12:42.783 --> 12:46.085
every 15 minutes is
not helping your cause.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.987
Let her come to you.

12:48.022 --> 12:51.024
As difficult as that might be,
you're gonna have to do that, Ben.

12:51.058 --> 12:52.458
Did she tell you that?

12:52.493 --> 12:55.361
You are hopeless.

12:55.396 --> 12:58.164
I take it we're talking about Amy.

12:58.198 --> 12:59.632
Hi, Dad. Hi.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.100
And, yes, we were talking about Amy.

13:01.135 --> 13:04.437
We're talking about the fact
that Amy is not talking to anyone.

13:04.471 --> 13:07.106
And it's been three
days. Three days, Dad.

13:07.141 --> 13:08.708
Yeah, I know.

13:10.110 --> 13:12.111
I'm here to see Ricky.

13:12.146 --> 13:13.947
You and I can talk tonight,

13:13.981 --> 13:16.349
if we have to, but
nothing's changed, Ben,

13:16.383 --> 13:17.984
and nothing's going to change.

13:19.253 --> 13:22.855
So we'll see you at
dinner- Betty and me.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.657
But, son,

13:24.692 --> 13:27.660
Betty's tired of hearing
about Amy, so knock it off.

13:27.695 --> 13:29.162
I'm sorry.

13:29.196 --> 13:31.297
Betty's tired of hearing about Amy?

13:31.332 --> 13:35.001
My stepmother is tired of hearing about the
thing that means the most to me right now?

13:35.035 --> 13:37.437
Well, I don't think she
minds hearing about the baby.

13:37.471 --> 13:39.005
She's just tired of hearing about Amy.

13:41.442 --> 13:43.142
Are you going over to Adrian's tonight?

13:43.177 --> 13:45.945
No. For your information,
and for Betty's information,

13:45.980 --> 13:48.014
I'm going over to Grace's house tonight.

13:50.351 --> 13:54.754
Oh, and tell John not to mention
that when he talks to Amy.

13:57.091 --> 13:58.958
He's driving me nuts, that kid.

13:58.993 --> 14:00.827
He's driving everyone nuts.

14:00.861 --> 14:03.796
Hey, I was wondering, you
talk to your mother this week?

14:03.831 --> 14:07.400
She called me the first
night after I got home.

14:07.434 --> 14:09.469
She won't call again for a few weeks.

14:09.503 --> 14:12.438
Then it'll be a few
months. And then who knows?

14:12.473 --> 14:14.507
That's a shame...

14:14.541 --> 14:16.709
for her to end up like
this on such a minor thing.

14:16.744 --> 14:18.578
Carrying a gun is not a minor thing.

14:18.612 --> 14:20.813
She could get hurt.
She could hurt someone.

14:20.848 --> 14:23.182
And, again, as I've pointed
out, it's against the law,

14:23.217 --> 14:25.051
and she was on parole.

14:25.085 --> 14:26.986
Yeah, it's tough.

14:27.021 --> 14:29.856
I mean, it's a tough one.
I mean, she did get sober,

14:29.890 --> 14:31.791
and she seemed like she was
straightening her life out,

14:31.825 --> 14:34.661
and then she slipped up like that.

14:34.695 --> 14:37.063
How do you know all this
stuff about my mother?

14:37.097 --> 14:39.198
Bunny. Bunny told me.

14:39.233 --> 14:41.200
She really enjoyed meeting her.

14:41.235 --> 14:43.136
Thought she was good in here.

14:43.170 --> 14:45.571
She's good at any job for a day.

14:45.606 --> 14:47.707
Then she usually goes
back to her old job.

14:47.741 --> 14:49.742
Maybe she just hasn't
found the right job yet.

14:49.777 --> 14:52.679
No, she found the right job, or jobs.

14:52.713 --> 14:54.781
But dealing drugs and
getting paid for sex

14:54.815 --> 14:57.550
are both illegal and demoralizing.

14:58.485 --> 15:01.187
But moving on.

15:01.221 --> 15:04.323
Yeah. Sorry. Like I said, moving on.

15:04.358 --> 15:06.359
No one wants to do those things.

15:06.393 --> 15:08.361
I mean, sometimes they do those things

15:08.395 --> 15:11.431
'cause they don't know
anything else to do to survive.

15:11.465 --> 15:14.500
So here's what I'm thinking-
or what Bunny's thinking.

15:14.535 --> 15:17.837
Maybe we could offer
your mom a job here.

15:17.871 --> 15:20.006
It might help her get out.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.407
She just went in.

15:21.442 --> 15:24.477
Yeah, well, I think
we could get her out.

15:24.511 --> 15:26.979
She deserves another
chance, don't you think?

15:27.014 --> 15:28.347
She's had lots of chances.

15:28.382 --> 15:30.016
This is probably her hundredth chance.

15:30.050 --> 15:31.884
Yeah.

15:31.919 --> 15:33.519
But you never know.

15:33.554 --> 15:35.354
This time, she might turn around.

15:35.389 --> 15:37.957
She might not. She might.

15:37.991 --> 15:40.226
How are you gonna get
my mother out of jail?

15:40.260 --> 15:42.128
Pay someone?

15:42.162 --> 15:44.030
No, no, no. Nothing like that.

15:44.064 --> 15:45.498
Then what?

15:45.532 --> 15:48.000
You have a friend in the
DA's office or something?

15:48.035 --> 15:51.104
We both have a friend in
the DA's office, don't we?

15:51.138 --> 15:54.607
Oh, no. I'm not asking
Adrian's father for a favor.

15:54.641 --> 15:56.976
I don't want anything to
do with her or her family.

15:57.010 --> 15:59.312
And your son just got
his daughter pregnant.

15:59.346 --> 16:00.913
You're gonna ask him for a favor?

16:00.948 --> 16:02.582
I'm happy you pointed that out.

16:02.616 --> 16:05.451
Well, not happy, but since you
brought it up, you're right.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.521
I'm hardly in a position to
be asking Ruben for a favor.

16:08.555 --> 16:09.622
Me?

16:10.991 --> 16:12.825
No, I don't wanna ask.

16:12.860 --> 16:15.895
I only ask people for
favors for myself, okay?

16:15.929 --> 16:18.965
And someday, I might
need a favor from Ruben.

16:18.999 --> 16:21.334
And I don't wanna use up
my favors on my mother.

16:21.368 --> 16:22.969
She is your mother.

16:24.304 --> 16:26.572
Yeah, she is.

16:26.607 --> 16:29.108
But she's not really a mother,

16:29.143 --> 16:32.645
less the foster parents and
my other mother, Margaret.

16:32.679 --> 16:35.214
Now, if Margaret needed
a favor- any favor-

16:35.249 --> 16:37.116
I'd do anything for her that I could do

16:37.151 --> 16:38.918
because she's always been there for me.

16:38.952 --> 16:41.087
Which is not the case
for my other mother,

16:41.121 --> 16:43.489
the one who's in jail.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.424
Who wants her out of jail anyway?

16:45.459 --> 16:47.760
Bunny. Bunny likes her.

16:47.795 --> 16:50.129
She needs somebody here during the day.

16:50.164 --> 16:51.964
It's a lot busier during the day.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.133
She said your mother was
really good with people.

16:54.168 --> 16:56.969
Of course she's good
with people. She was a-

16:57.004 --> 16:59.872
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm-
I'm really sorry.

16:59.907 --> 17:01.340
Moving on.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.442
It's just that,

17:03.477 --> 17:06.813
my mother working here?

17:06.847 --> 17:09.781
Mr. Boykewich, you don't know my mother.

17:09.817 --> 17:12.050
You don't want my mother
working here, believe me.

17:12.085 --> 17:13.085
You don't.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.720
Son, you know me.

17:14.755 --> 17:16.923
You know I believe in giving
people another chance-

17:16.957 --> 17:20.059
a chance to straighten out their
lives and to do the right thing.

17:20.093 --> 17:22.060
Did you just call him "son"?

17:22.095 --> 17:24.997
Thanks a lot.

17:35.042 --> 17:36.876
Hi, Adrian.

17:36.910 --> 17:39.378
Hey, Ben. Uh, what time
do you get off work?

17:39.413 --> 17:41.447
Adrian, I told Grace
I'd go over to her house.

17:41.481 --> 17:43.983
Yeah, we, you told me

17:44.017 --> 17:46.552
you wanted to go to this first
doctor's appointment with me.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.021
<i>And I had asked the nurse to call
me if there was a cancellation,</i>

17:49.056 --> 17:52.191
<i>and the last person for today
just canceled, so we can get in.</i>

17:52.226 --> 17:54.060
Then you can go over to Grace's house.

17:54.094 --> 17:56.796
Uh, okay.

17:56.830 --> 17:58.331
Sure. Then it's a date.

17:58.365 --> 17:59.899
Our first.

18:08.103 --> 18:10.438
Oh, Ashley, I didn't know you were home.

18:10.472 --> 18:12.707
I need for you to watch Robie
until your dad gets home.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.309
Mimsy's
husband- Eugene.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.578
Her husband's name is Eugene. And no.

18:16.612 --> 18:19.113
Mimsy has the flu, and Eugene is
speaking at a conference tonight.

18:19.148 --> 18:20.882
Oh, on what? Grifting at 80?

18:20.916 --> 18:23.251
He's not 80, and he's not a grifter.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.587
I don't think. He's a very nice man.

18:25.621 --> 18:28.423
He didn't know that Mimsy had
Alzheimer's when he married her.

18:28.457 --> 18:30.325
She said that she was
visiting from Monaco

18:30.359 --> 18:31.793
and had ties to the royal family.

18:31.827 --> 18:33.795
Which goes toward him being a grifter.

18:33.829 --> 18:36.531
Well, it would be if she had any money,
but she doesn't have a lot of money.

18:36.565 --> 18:37.799
No, not now anyway.

18:37.833 --> 18:40.034
He loves her. He thinks she's funny.

18:40.069 --> 18:42.070
She loves him. She thinks he's funny.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.972
They laugh a lot. They
enjoy each other's company.

18:44.006 --> 18:45.640
Oh, is that what he told you?

18:45.674 --> 18:47.942
I have to go up there, and I
have a date with your father,

18:47.977 --> 18:49.811
which I'm not gonna be able to make,

18:49.845 --> 18:52.080
and I can't get hold of him because
he's not picking up his phone,

18:52.114 --> 18:54.983
and Donovan doesn't know where he is, and
I can't bring Robie because Mimsy's sick.

18:55.017 --> 18:56.317
Can you help me out here?

18:56.352 --> 18:58.119
Fine. I'll try to find Dad.

19:02.257 --> 19:04.926
850, 855, 860, 865,

19:04.960 --> 19:08.796
870, 71, 72,
73, 74-

19:08.831 --> 19:10.698
All right. I know where to find you.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.101
I'm sure it's all there. If you
thought I wouldn't cheat you,

19:13.135 --> 19:15.303
why couldn't this wait
for tonight? Cash up front.

19:15.337 --> 19:17.705
And you're getting
this, which, by the way,

19:17.740 --> 19:19.874
will look a lot better by candlelight.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.509
You want violins?

19:21.543 --> 19:23.611
Do violins come with
the room? Ã  la carte.

19:23.646 --> 19:24.912
How much?

19:24.947 --> 19:28.716
Let me show you a menu
of all of our services.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.952
A rose- One
rose is 50 bucks?

19:30.986 --> 19:32.320
Long stem.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.621
The house red wine is a hundred bucks.

19:33.656 --> 19:36.591
Well, they bottle it for me
special back in the old country.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.826
Sicily? Napa.

19:38.861 --> 19:41.029
Listen, friend of Donovan's,

19:41.063 --> 19:42.764
you're gonna have a good time here.

19:42.798 --> 19:44.766
Where else can you have a meal in a room

19:44.800 --> 19:46.734
that has a couch for
after the meal, huh?

19:46.769 --> 19:48.836
My house, that's where. Ahhh.

19:48.871 --> 19:51.105
You're everything Donovan said you'd be.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.574
Come on, my friend. This
is money well spent here.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.643
You and your lover are
gonna have a good time.

19:55.678 --> 19:58.346
She's not my lover.
She's my wife. We'll see.

20:03.519 --> 20:05.386
Oh, cookies again.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.055
I smell Ben.

20:07.089 --> 20:09.624
Yeah, he's coming over.

20:09.658 --> 20:11.626
I don't know what time,
but after he gets back

20:11.660 --> 20:13.895
with Adrian from her
first OB-GYN appointment.

20:13.929 --> 20:15.797
Oh, dear honey.

20:15.831 --> 20:19.333
Adrian's first OB-GYN appointment?

20:19.368 --> 20:20.868
Grace,

20:20.903 --> 20:22.470
you
r-

20:22.504 --> 20:24.405
I don't even know what to say.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.507
Well, you don't have to say anything.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.576
I know you don't want
me to go out with him,

20:28.610 --> 20:30.611
but I am.

20:32.514 --> 20:33.848
All right.

20:33.882 --> 20:36.517
Well, you're a big girl.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.519
You can decide for yourself
what's right for you.

20:38.554 --> 20:41.355
That's right. I can
decide what's right for me.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.758
And I know that it's slightly unorthodox

20:43.792 --> 20:45.193
for me to be going out with a guy

20:45.227 --> 20:46.894
who's having a baby with my best friend,

20:46.929 --> 20:49.130
but if that's what I wanna do,
then that's what I wanna do.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.566
You married a guy nine
months after Dad died.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.935
A lot of women wouldn't
have done that either.

20:53.969 --> 20:57.105
Uh-huh. Okay. Well...

20:57.139 --> 21:00.408
Here. I got this for you at the market.

21:00.442 --> 21:02.643
What is it?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.045
It's a new product for your skin.

21:04.079 --> 21:06.147
You wash your face
with it in the morning,

21:06.181 --> 21:08.082
and not only does it
get your skin clean,

21:08.117 --> 21:10.218
it gives you a burst of energy.

21:10.252 --> 21:12.353
So if your date doesn't
go so well tonight,

21:12.387 --> 21:14.655
tomorrow morning, you
get up, you use this,

21:14.690 --> 21:18.159
and maybe you get enough energy
to do something else, Grace.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.594
Something that's good for you,

21:19.628 --> 21:21.696
and maybe even something
that's good for somebody else.

21:21.730 --> 21:23.831
Something, uh, beautiful

21:23.866 --> 21:26.734
instead of something
slightly unorthodox.

21:26.769 --> 21:28.703
Did you get one for yourself?

21:28.737 --> 21:30.805
Oh, wait. It's too late.

21:30.839 --> 21:32.974
You married the guy.

21:40.582 --> 21:42.517
Tom, you said you
were going out tonight.

21:42.551 --> 21:47.421
I was, but Adrian had an appointment,

21:47.456 --> 21:48.756
and she can't go.

21:48.791 --> 21:50.291
Well, what kind of appointment?

21:50.325 --> 21:52.593
I mean, if she's getting her
hair done or nails or something,

21:52.628 --> 21:54.595
she'll still have
plenty of time to go out.

21:54.630 --> 21:57.498
Doctor's appointment.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.635
Oh. Maybe you should go with her.

22:00.669 --> 22:02.537
I don't think so.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.039
I have a date, and I was
really looking forward

22:05.073 --> 22:06.641
to having the place to myself.

22:06.675 --> 22:08.242
Oh, really?

22:08.277 --> 22:09.277
Really.

22:09.311 --> 22:13.214
You could rent my half for the evening.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.049
How much?

22:16.051 --> 22:18.653
It will cost you a lot of money.

22:18.687 --> 22:20.254
That's all right.

22:20.289 --> 22:22.123
I got three other
people that'll pitch in.

22:22.157 --> 22:24.892
Name the price, and it better
not be more than 20 bucks.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.928
You're kidding yourself.

22:30.165 --> 22:33.401
Attaboy. I think the kitty's over there.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.537
Kitty's that way. Right there.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.706
Go get him.

22:38.740 --> 22:42.210
Hey, Ashley.

22:42.244 --> 22:44.278
I need you to babysit.

22:44.313 --> 22:46.581
Oh, me? Really? I would love to babysit.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.983
I know you don't mean that,

22:49.017 --> 22:50.618
but I need some help tonight.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.387
Well, I'm already babysitting,

22:53.422 --> 22:54.922
at least until my dad gets back,

22:54.957 --> 22:56.991
and then I think I'll
do something else-

22:57.025 --> 22:59.193
something fun, something just for me.

22:59.228 --> 23:00.761
I don't think I'll be that long.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.363
I should be back by 9:00.

23:02.397 --> 23:04.565
No. Why not?

23:06.335 --> 23:08.703
All right. Don't do this, okay?

23:08.737 --> 23:10.304
You know I care about your sister,

23:10.339 --> 23:11.806
but you also know I care about you.

23:11.840 --> 23:15.243
Do I know that? No, I don't know that.

23:15.277 --> 23:17.445
Ashley, we agreed to be friends.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.614
So what, that moves
Amy into first place?

23:19.648 --> 23:22.617
I said she was
second place behind John.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.353
I didn't mean it the way
you're trying to make it sound.

23:25.387 --> 23:27.321
I care about Amy in a very different way

23:27.356 --> 23:28.923
than I care about anybody else.

23:29.925 --> 23:32.193
Oops, you did it again.

23:32.227 --> 23:34.495
Look, just take the kid with
you wherever you're going,

23:34.529 --> 23:36.697
'cause Aunt Ashley is
not keeping him tonight.

23:36.732 --> 23:38.532
You owe me.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.768
I don't owe you. I
don't owe you anything.

23:40.802 --> 23:42.770
Yeah, you do. Oh, how do you figure?

23:42.804 --> 23:44.939
You told your sister that you kissed me.

23:44.973 --> 23:46.641
Oh, so you are talking to her.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.477
Not really. She didn't
give me any time to explain.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.647
So you know what? You
explain. You explain it to her.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.148
I'll be home around 9:00.

24:06.951 --> 24:08.685
Where have you been?

24:08.720 --> 24:10.254
Mani-pedi. Took forever.
Fridays, you know.

24:10.288 --> 24:11.688
Got just enough time to grab a shower,

24:11.723 --> 24:12.956
then time to grab your mother.

24:12.991 --> 24:14.425
Hand me your phone.

24:19.764 --> 24:21.532
Huh. Your phone was off.

24:21.566 --> 24:23.000
All right.

24:23.034 --> 24:24.468
Mom had to go to Mimsy's.

24:24.502 --> 24:26.537
What? No!

24:26.571 --> 24:28.238
Yeah, that's what I said.

24:28.273 --> 24:31.475
But the grifter is speaking at
some seminar, and Mimsy has the flu.

24:31.509 --> 24:33.177
No! No, no!

24:33.211 --> 24:35.412
Look, if you make them cry,
I'm gonna get really angry.

24:35.447 --> 24:38.015
I paid a grand to get the backroom at
Lonzo's just for your mother and me.

24:38.049 --> 24:39.750
This was my comeback night.

24:39.784 --> 24:41.718
I thought you were back already.

24:41.753 --> 24:43.554
Oh, this is the stupidest divorce ever.

24:43.588 --> 24:45.989
A grand! She can't not go!

24:46.024 --> 24:49.193
You paid $1,000 just to get
the back room at a restaurant?

24:49.227 --> 24:50.961
It's got a couch. And that's not all.

24:50.995 --> 24:53.163
I got a violin and a rose.

24:53.198 --> 24:54.698
Couldn't you go stay
with your grandmother?

24:54.732 --> 24:56.166
Oh, and how would I get there?

24:56.201 --> 24:57.701
Where's Ricky? Whcouldn't he take you?

24:57.735 --> 24:59.636
Oh, he had some kind
of stupid appointment.

24:59.671 --> 25:00.971
That's why I'm babysitting John.

25:01.005 --> 25:03.841
Oh, this can't be happening. Damn!

25:03.875 --> 25:06.310
I think I broke a nail.

25:07.946 --> 25:10.314
You're not going in with me.

25:10.348 --> 25:13.150
Oh. Of course not.

25:13.184 --> 25:16.753
But what actually happens
here in the office?

25:18.790 --> 25:21.058
Never actually been in an office before.

25:21.092 --> 25:23.026
I usually just go to the clinic,

25:23.061 --> 25:24.828
but with my mom and dad married now,

25:24.863 --> 25:26.163
I've got really good insurance.

25:26.197 --> 25:28.765
And me and my dad. So if this place

25:28.800 --> 25:30.701
or this doctor are not to your liking,

25:30.735 --> 25:33.036
then we can go someplace else.

25:33.071 --> 25:34.872
Ricky's mom recommended him.

25:34.906 --> 25:36.573
His practice is teen mothers.

25:36.608 --> 25:38.909
His?

25:38.943 --> 25:39.943
Yeah.

25:39.978 --> 25:41.478
His?

25:41.513 --> 25:43.380
Stop. You're making me nervous.

25:43.414 --> 25:44.982
I am so sorry.

25:45.016 --> 25:47.017
That patient canceled and rescheduled,

25:47.051 --> 25:48.318
and we already had you coming in,

25:48.353 --> 25:50.020
so I didn't want to
cancel your appointment.

25:50.054 --> 25:52.623
I'm Dr. Attavi. Adrian.

25:52.657 --> 25:54.458
Hi. Hi.

25:54.492 --> 25:56.393
And you are?

25:56.427 --> 25:57.828
I'm the father.

25:57.862 --> 26:00.063
That was my next question.
What's your name, Dad?

26:00.098 --> 26:02.466
Uh, he's more like a friend.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.334
But I'm still the father.

26:04.369 --> 26:08.205
Oh, uh, Ben Boykewich.

26:08.239 --> 26:10.507
Boykewich.

26:10.542 --> 26:13.477
You're not related to
that Sausage King, are you?

26:13.511 --> 26:16.813
I am The
Sausage King. You got that?

26:16.848 --> 26:18.916
He's the prince,

26:18.950 --> 26:20.517
son of The Sausage King.

26:20.552 --> 26:23.120
Oh. I'm sorry.

26:23.154 --> 26:25.188
I hope that was a fair impersonation.

26:25.223 --> 26:26.623
Pretty much. Yeah.

26:26.658 --> 26:29.393
Great. Well, welcome, Your Majesty.

26:31.095 --> 26:33.697
So are you excited about the baby?

26:33.731 --> 26:36.166
I am, now that you're here.

26:37.135 --> 26:39.803
You see, I was dating this guy,

26:39.837 --> 26:41.939
and he had a baby with Ben's girlfriend,

26:41.973 --> 26:43.407
and so, I slept with Ben.

26:43.441 --> 26:45.008
But unfortunately,

26:45.043 --> 26:47.044
I was on a new pill,
and the condom broke,

26:47.078 --> 26:49.179
and now this guy isn't speaking to me,

26:49.213 --> 26:51.415
and Ben's girlfriend
isn't speaking to him.

26:51.449 --> 26:52.716
That's the worst
that's happened-

26:52.750 --> 26:54.251
people aren't speaking to each other.

26:54.285 --> 26:57.154
That's very civilized.
Nothing like my high school.

26:57.188 --> 27:00.424
And, um, when were you in school?

27:00.458 --> 27:01.625
In high school?

27:01.659 --> 27:04.428
I'm sure way before you were born.

27:04.462 --> 27:05.696
How old are you?

27:05.730 --> 27:08.632
I'm old enough to deliver a baby.

27:08.666 --> 27:10.167
I've delivered quite a few.

27:10.201 --> 27:13.403
Yeah, you look
like you'd be good at it.

27:14.439 --> 27:15.505
Excuse me.

27:15.540 --> 27:17.741
This isn't going the way I
was thinking it should go.

27:17.775 --> 27:19.209
And how was that, Ben?

27:19.243 --> 27:21.311
Well, for one, you're not a woman.

27:21.346 --> 27:22.846
No, I'm not a woman.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.648
But I am in practice with my mom.

27:24.682 --> 27:26.316
It's a mother-son practice.

27:26.351 --> 27:29.453
So there are times when a woman
may have to fill in for me.

27:29.487 --> 27:31.521
Oh, no. I can wait.

27:31.556 --> 27:33.490
For you, I mean.

27:33.524 --> 27:36.593
That's very nice of you.

27:36.628 --> 27:38.962
I'm assuming this is your first baby?

27:38.997 --> 27:40.063
Mm-hmm.

27:40.098 --> 27:41.632
Well, sometimes babies don't wait.

27:41.666 --> 27:44.301
They kind of have their own schedule.

27:44.335 --> 27:48.372
So you think you're about seven weeks?

27:48.406 --> 27:50.374
Yes. I'm absolutely certain.

27:50.408 --> 27:53.010
Oh, right. It was a very
special night for the two of you.

27:54.712 --> 27:56.480
And are you two reading
up on pregnancies?

27:56.514 --> 27:58.749
You know, it's very important
for you to do the right things

27:58.783 --> 28:00.784
for the baby at this stage.

28:00.818 --> 28:03.186
Do you know what a baby
looks like at seven weeks?

28:03.221 --> 28:06.356
Yeah. I'm- I'm still hung up
on the whole male doctor thing.

28:06.391 --> 28:10.460
Well, if it's gonna make
Adrian uncomfortable,

28:10.495 --> 28:12.329
we can get her in to see my mom.

28:12.363 --> 28:15.732
But wasn't it your mom who
recommended me to Adrian?

28:15.767 --> 28:17.934
No, that was my boyfriend's mom.

28:17.969 --> 28:19.736
The boyfriend that isn't speaking to me.

28:19.771 --> 28:21.338
The one who had the baby

28:21.372 --> 28:23.473
with his girlfriend who
isn't speaking to him.

28:23.508 --> 28:28.412
Yep. Now, so you were saying,
the baby at seven weeks...

28:28.446 --> 28:31.615
Yeah. Right now, the baby is
about the size of a raspberry.

28:31.649 --> 28:35.385
Really? Huh. And at eight weeks?

28:35.420 --> 28:36.887
A green olive.

28:36.921 --> 28:40.490
I'm sorry, but before you ruin
every fruit and garnish for me,

28:40.525 --> 28:42.793
could we just talk alone for a minute?

28:42.827 --> 28:45.095
Okay. I'd be happy to step out.

28:45.129 --> 28:47.431
But let's make it quick.
It is Friday night.

28:47.465 --> 28:48.665
No. I meant you and me alone.

28:49.767 --> 28:51.301
Ignore him.

28:51.335 --> 28:53.904
You look like a really
good doctor to me,

28:53.938 --> 28:56.339
and I'm sure I'm in capable hands.

28:57.442 --> 28:58.842
Don't worry, okay?

28:58.876 --> 29:01.511
All the girls like me. And I am married.

29:01.546 --> 29:04.314
I have two daughters of my
own that I delivered myself.

29:04.348 --> 29:06.717
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't
want you touching her.

29:06.751 --> 29:08.952
He could be a problem.

29:12.824 --> 29:17.327
<i>âª It's a simple
crush, you understand âª</i>

29:17.361 --> 29:21.231
<i>âª Sand kept slipping
through my hands âª</i>

29:22.400 --> 29:24.501
Hi.

29:24.535 --> 29:27.037
Do not acknowledge her. She won't leave.

29:27.071 --> 29:30.273
What? Did you say something?

29:30.308 --> 29:33.410
It's so nice in here,
huh? Geez, Grace.

29:33.444 --> 29:35.345
No. It's okay, really.

29:35.379 --> 29:38.448
Don't worry. I'm not
staying. I just want to dance.

29:38.483 --> 29:40.150
All right.

29:40.184 --> 29:42.686
Fine. One dance, and
then you're leaving.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.755
Yeah, I'm leaving.

29:44.789 --> 29:47.324
I, uh, actually have a date, too.

29:47.358 --> 29:50.393
Oh, really? Who are you going out with?

29:50.428 --> 29:52.362
Ben.

29:52.396 --> 29:53.997
Ben?

29:54.031 --> 29:56.733
Yeah. He just had to go
somewhere with someone first.

29:56.768 --> 29:58.902
So he's going out with Adrian,

29:58.936 --> 30:01.471
then coming over here
and going out with you?

30:01.506 --> 30:04.074
Kind of. It's a doctor's appointment.

30:04.108 --> 30:07.511
<i>âª</i>

30:07.545 --> 30:09.379
So, is Amy still not
talking to you, too?

30:11.215 --> 30:13.083
Good.

30:13.117 --> 30:16.253
Anyway, I just came in here to dance

30:16.287 --> 30:18.421
and pass the time,

30:18.456 --> 30:20.423
hang out
with my, uh-

30:20.458 --> 30:23.093
Wait. Are we friends?

30:25.496 --> 30:27.998
Cool move.

30:29.667 --> 30:33.603
<i>âª I was lost, but I found
what I was looking for âª</i>

30:33.638 --> 30:35.138
<i>âª We can,
we can- âª</i>

30:36.374 --> 30:37.908
Coming.

30:40.411 --> 30:42.379
Thank you so much.

30:42.413 --> 30:43.647
Not a problem.

30:43.681 --> 30:45.582
Kind of curious as to
what you have to tell me.

30:45.616 --> 30:47.450
Can I get you something to drink?

30:47.485 --> 30:49.186
Got any scotch?

30:50.388 --> 30:52.322
To answer your question, I'm 17.

30:53.524 --> 30:56.193
I forgot. I actually forgot.

30:56.227 --> 30:58.128
Your phone call made
me a little nervous.

30:58.162 --> 31:00.564
I can get you some apple juice or milk.

31:00.598 --> 31:02.966
No. Skip it. I'm fine.

31:21.485 --> 31:23.687
Here's the thing-
You're the father.

31:25.122 --> 31:26.990
I knew it.

31:27.024 --> 31:29.893
You and Adrian, not Ben and Adan.

31:29.927 --> 31:32.796
I had a feeling. No,
it's Ben and Adrian.

31:32.830 --> 31:34.764
Ben's the father. I'm not the father.

31:34.799 --> 31:36.233
But you want to be a father.

31:36.267 --> 31:38.101
I am a father.

31:38.135 --> 31:39.903
This has nothing to do with that.

31:39.937 --> 31:42.372
This is something completely different.

31:42.406 --> 31:46.610
I need to ask
for your help... again.

31:46.644 --> 31:48.778
But you're not the father?

31:48.813 --> 31:50.180
No.

31:50.214 --> 31:52.048
Well, I just
thought that-

31:52.083 --> 31:53.717
No.

31:55.319 --> 31:56.653
All right.

31:56.687 --> 31:59.756
Well, then, ask.

31:59.790 --> 32:01.791
What do you need?

32:01.826 --> 32:03.827
Are you in some kind
of trouble yourself?

32:04.795 --> 32:07.898
My mom went back to jail.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.735
She violated her parole

32:11.769 --> 32:14.771
by carrying a gun in her purse,

32:14.805 --> 32:17.374
which she feels she
needed for protection.

32:19.076 --> 32:21.544
But before you say anything,
I do not sympathize with that.

32:21.579 --> 32:23.246
She knows the rules.

32:23.281 --> 32:26.950
Besides, it's dangerous
for her to carry a gun.

32:26.984 --> 32:29.286
She's always chosen to
live a dangerous life, so...

32:35.426 --> 32:37.160
So I don't even know why I'm asking,

32:37.194 --> 32:39.062
because she was never
really a mother to me.

32:39.096 --> 32:42.232
Lately, I've been
working on forgiving her.

32:43.601 --> 32:47.304
And... the thing is,

32:47.338 --> 32:50.373
she's one year sober,

32:50.408 --> 32:54.210
and she had been doing really well.

32:54.245 --> 32:57.480
But she was having
trouble getting a job,

32:57.515 --> 32:59.249
and she came here to see me,

32:59.283 --> 33:02.852
and she met the woman who
runs the butcher shop-

33:02.887 --> 33:04.654
Bunny.

33:04.689 --> 33:10.260
And Bunny and Mr. Boykewich
are willing to give her a job.

33:12.630 --> 33:15.732
And if there's some
way that you could maybe

33:15.766 --> 33:17.434
work with her court-appointed attorney

33:17.468 --> 33:19.502
and see if there's any way
she could appeal her case

33:19.537 --> 33:21.304
or something...

33:21.339 --> 33:24.274
Oh, I don't
know about that, Ricky.

33:25.643 --> 33:28.211
If you had gotten to me
before she went back in,

33:28.245 --> 33:33.149
then maybe.
But even then...

33:33.184 --> 33:36.353
I can look into it.
That's all I can tell you.

33:36.387 --> 33:38.788
I just don't know.

33:38.823 --> 33:41.091
I don't know what her record looks like.

33:41.125 --> 33:44.194
I don't know if she's telling
the truth about what happened.

33:44.228 --> 33:46.363
I just have to have a
lot more information.

33:46.397 --> 33:49.065
I had to ask.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.234
Like I said, I'm working on forgiveness.

33:52.803 --> 33:55.372
Although I don't know
about any togetherness-

33:55.406 --> 33:57.607
working together and all that, so...

33:58.642 --> 34:00.343
Well, I'll, uh...

34:00.378 --> 34:02.245
I'll see what I can do.

34:04.081 --> 34:06.249
But, um,

34:07.418 --> 34:09.252
I have a favor to ask as well.

34:11.255 --> 34:15.091
As long as you're
working on forgiveness,

34:15.126 --> 34:17.260
think about forgiving Adrian, will you?

34:19.663 --> 34:22.197
She's not gonna come to you for that.

34:22.233 --> 34:26.302
But I think it would
help if she had that.

34:26.337 --> 34:28.103
And just like you had to ask

34:28.139 --> 34:31.007
because this involves your mother,

34:31.042 --> 34:33.143
I had to ask

34:33.177 --> 34:35.145
because this is about my daughter.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.215
She doesn't need to be struggling
through a teenage pregnancy

34:39.250 --> 34:42.485
and have the one guy
she's ever really loved

34:42.520 --> 34:44.219
not speaking to her.

35:12.801 --> 35:15.035
This is amazing. Your
mother would've loved this.

35:15.070 --> 35:16.937
You can bring her some other time.

35:16.971 --> 35:18.272
Not at these prices.

35:18.306 --> 35:20.474
How's the online store doing?

35:20.508 --> 35:21.975
What online store?

35:22.010 --> 35:25.145
The one offering environmentally
friendly furniture custom made.

35:26.514 --> 35:28.882
I Google, and so does Mom,
so you better tell her.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.752
I did it for her. I'm trying
to draw her into the business.

35:31.786 --> 35:34.488
The two of you are gonna work together?

35:34.522 --> 35:36.023
You can't even be married together.

35:36.057 --> 35:37.858
I'm not gonna work with
her. I was just gonna get

35:37.892 --> 35:39.593
her idea going, and
then turn it over to her.

35:39.627 --> 35:41.495
You should've told her.

35:41.529 --> 35:43.430
I didn't know it'd go over so well.

35:43.465 --> 35:46.400
I mean, her business plan was
pretty goo but you never know.

35:46.434 --> 35:49.203
And I was thinking of turning the online
business and the store over to her.

35:49.237 --> 35:51.071
And you're gonna do what?

35:51.106 --> 35:53.140
This. Watch the babies.

35:53.174 --> 35:56.210
This is my dream. I always
wanted to be a stay-at-home dad.

35:56.244 --> 35:58.746
I missed out on a lot of good things
when you girls were growing up.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.814
I see where this is going.

36:01.983 --> 36:04.551
You blame yourself for Amy, don't you?

36:05.954 --> 36:07.454
Yes, I do.

36:07.489 --> 36:09.757
It's not gonna happen again, Dad,

36:09.791 --> 36:11.925
with me, if that's what you're thinking.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.727
I want to know about you and Ricky.

36:13.762 --> 36:16.530
Geez, did he tell the
whole world I kissed him?

36:16.564 --> 36:19.333
No. You kissed him, or he kissed you?

36:20.301 --> 36:21.969
I kissed him.

36:22.003 --> 36:24.705
I was going to, and then he kissed me.

36:26.508 --> 36:28.709
Was it everything you
dreamed it would be?

36:29.644 --> 36:31.311
Pretty much.

36:31.346 --> 36:33.147
Aw, Ashley.

36:33.181 --> 36:35.582
I know, Dad.

36:35.617 --> 36:38.852
I know. It-
It can never be.

36:40.622 --> 36:44.558
I mean, unless it is.

36:44.592 --> 36:45.893
It isn't.

36:47.128 --> 36:50.597
Don't make me throw up
a thousand-dollar meal.

36:50.632 --> 36:53.567
Please don't waste
any pain on this boy, Ashley.

36:53.601 --> 36:56.703
Please? I can't have
him hurt both my girls.

36:56.738 --> 36:59.540
I can't help it, Dad.

37:00.642 --> 37:03.143
I'm trying. I just...

37:03.178 --> 37:04.711
I know it's wrong.

37:04.746 --> 37:08.282
It is, Ashley. It's entirely wrong.

37:08.316 --> 37:10.384
I know. I just...

37:10.418 --> 37:12.386
I just can't help it.

37:18.793 --> 37:21.862
What time was the party over?

37:21.896 --> 37:23.764
Oh, about half hour after it started,

37:23.798 --> 37:26.433
or 15 minutes after your sister arrived.

37:26.468 --> 37:28.202
Too bad.

37:28.236 --> 37:29.970
Yep.

37:31.105 --> 37:33.106
I mean, the guy looks like he's 12.

37:33.141 --> 37:34.775
You know, maybe 13, tops.

37:34.809 --> 37:35.976
And then Adrian asked him

37:36.010 --> 37:37.678
about each day of the entire pregnancy.

37:37.712 --> 37:41.148
Yeah, that's a lot of days.

37:41.182 --> 37:43.183
That's a lot of days for
you to be with Adrian.

37:43.218 --> 37:45.786
Yeah, not to mention
18 years after that.

37:46.654 --> 37:48.121
Yeah. Not to mention.

37:48.156 --> 37:49.823
Good cookies.

37:49.858 --> 37:52.359
Oh, don't worry. I can teach
Adrian how to make them.

37:52.393 --> 37:54.161
Huh?

37:55.296 --> 37:56.997
Nothing. Nothing.

37:57.031 --> 37:59.032
I'm really glad that you stopped by.

37:59.067 --> 38:01.001
You want to take some home with you?

38:01.035 --> 38:03.003
You sure? Yeah. I'm sure.

38:03.037 --> 38:05.572
Thank you. Yeah.

38:07.075 --> 38:08.542
Ah, more.

38:17.352 --> 38:18.819
Wait.

38:28.062 --> 38:29.963
You know the way out.

38:29.998 --> 38:31.698
Out? Yeah.

38:51.419 --> 38:54.555
Hey, I thought I heard you out here.

38:54.589 --> 38:56.690
You're up early. I went to bed early.

38:56.724 --> 38:58.358
How'd your appointment go?

38:58.393 --> 39:00.394
Really well. I really
like this new doctor.

39:00.428 --> 39:01.495
Good.

39:01.529 --> 39:03.530
Yeah, and I got a lot of stuff to read.

39:03.565 --> 39:05.566
And I'm gonna switch over
to the prenatal vitamins

39:05.600 --> 39:07.734
and make sure I eat right
and get plenty of rest

39:07.769 --> 39:10.137
and do anything else the
doctor tells me to do.

39:10.171 --> 39:12.573
That's good. That's really good.

39:12.607 --> 39:15.075
Good to take care of
yourself and the baby. Yep.

39:15.109 --> 39:17.578
So the appointment went well?
Yeah. How'd your night go?

39:17.612 --> 39:20.113
Oh, it was interesting.

39:20.148 --> 39:22.182
I saw Ricky last night.

39:23.785 --> 39:25.052
Did you?

39:25.086 --> 39:27.888
Yeah, he wants some
legal help for his mom.

39:27.922 --> 39:31.625
Oh. Well, I'm glad you can help him.

39:31.659 --> 39:33.961
Well, I don't know if I can help him,

39:33.995 --> 39:35.729
but I told him he can help me.

39:35.763 --> 39:37.030
Help you how?

39:37.065 --> 39:39.399
By at least speaking to my daughter.

39:39.434 --> 39:43.337
Dad, you
didn't have to do that.

39:43.371 --> 39:46.206
I understand if Ricky
never speaks to me again.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.542
Yeah, well, I don't.

39:48.576 --> 39:51.979
Things happen. And you
two were really close.

39:52.013 --> 39:55.482
This baby's gonna change your life,

39:55.516 --> 39:57.517
and it's not gonna be easy.

39:57.552 --> 40:00.020
You don't need any friends
turning against you.

40:00.054 --> 40:02.856
That friendship was gonna
come to an end anyway.

40:02.890 --> 40:04.625
We were on a collision course.

40:04.659 --> 40:09.796
But if Ricky decides
he wants to speak to me,

40:09.831 --> 40:12.733
then I would speak to him.

40:12.767 --> 40:15.702
Maybe we could be
friends again... someday.

40:15.737 --> 40:17.671
Maybe you could.

40:31.853 --> 40:32.853
Amy?

40:32.887 --> 40:34.321
Hey, Adrian.

40:35.323 --> 40:36.990
Hi.

40:37.025 --> 40:39.059
Did you mean to call me?

40:39.093 --> 40:40.327
Yeah, I meant to call you.

40:40.361 --> 40:41.928
There's something I want to say to you.

40:41.963 --> 40:45.232
All right. Go ahead.

40:45.266 --> 40:47.534
Say anything you want. I can take it.

40:47.568 --> 40:49.970
Adrian, you know, this
music program I'm in

40:50.004 --> 40:52.239
is for teen mothers who are musicians.

40:52.273 --> 40:55.642
And I've gotten to know about
40 other girls who are mothers,

40:55.677 --> 40:57.944
just like me and just like
who you're going to be.

40:57.979 --> 40:58.945
Yeah?

40:58.980 --> 41:01.314
Yeah, and it's not easy

41:01.349 --> 41:03.050
to have a baby in high school.

41:03.084 --> 41:05.819
One of the hardest things about
it is you lose most your friends.

41:06.721 --> 41:07.754
Okay.

41:07.789 --> 41:09.890
Not that we were ever close friends,

41:09.924 --> 41:11.191
but there were a few times

41:11.225 --> 41:13.493
when you came up to me and
offered to be my friend,

41:13.528 --> 41:15.829
and I just want to know
if that offer still stands.

41:15.863 --> 41:18.198
The offer to be your friend?

41:18.232 --> 41:20.133
Well, for us to be friends.

41:20.168 --> 41:22.069
I mean, after all, we're neighbors.

41:22.103 --> 41:24.604
<i>And I don't know. Maybe one day</i>

41:24.639 --> 41:26.239
our children will play together.

41:27.141 --> 41:29.042
Yeah, maybe they will.

41:29.077 --> 41:30.444
So friends?

41:30.478 --> 41:31.511
Friends.

41:31.546 --> 41:33.346
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

41:33.381 --> 41:35.916
Okay. See you.

41:35.950 --> 41:37.217
Bye, Adrian.

41:37.251 --> 41:39.419
Bye, Amy.
