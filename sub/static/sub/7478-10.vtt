00:05.130 --> 00:09.875
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.943
Merry Christmas.

00:17.967 --> 00:19.721
Merry Christmas.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.025
Merry Christmas.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.094
Hello? Hello?

01:34.511 --> 01:37.002
- Where are we going with this?
- Right over here.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.762
Turn around.
Turn around. Turn around.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.368
Ah. Okay.

01:42.392 --> 01:43.936
What is that?

01:45.063 --> 01:46.142
It's a Christmas tree.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.412
You're joking.

01:48.436 --> 01:49.616
No, no.

01:49.640 --> 01:53.661
Douglas fir, Scotch pine,
Bruce spruce.

01:53.685 --> 01:55.215
These are Christmas trees.

01:55.239 --> 01:58.527
This is L.A., Hetty.
Wait till you see the menorah.

01:58.994 --> 02:03.122
I am so alone.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.117
Oh, Mr. GQ,
what's up with the big-boy clothes?

02:08.502 --> 02:10.555
- Somebody's got a hot date.
- No.

02:10.579 --> 02:12.938
- Mommy in town for the holidays?
- No, thank goodness.

02:12.962 --> 02:14.852
- Job interview.
- You're leaving us?

02:14.876 --> 02:17.566
- Uh, whoa, who's leaving us?
- Nate's got a job interview.

02:17.590 --> 02:18.853
- Where?
- Nowhere.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.277
I do not have a job interview.

02:20.301 --> 02:22.691
I just thought
that I would dress it up today.

02:22.715 --> 02:25.823
- Uh-huh. You backed into Hetty's Jag.
- Again.

02:25.847 --> 02:27.895
No. Don't even kid about that.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.752
Well, personally,
I think you look fantastic.

02:34.776 --> 02:36.666
God, I love men in suits.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.834
- And uniforms.
- And costumes.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.216
When did I date anybody
who wore a costume?

02:41.240 --> 02:42.466
What about the pirate guy?

02:42.490 --> 02:44.382
Didn't he make you
wear a milkmaid outfit?

02:44.406 --> 02:46.715
That was for a renaissance fair
and I was a wench.

02:46.739 --> 02:48.459
That's so much better.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.721
Oh, dear Lord. Eric, that shirt
is wrong on so many levels.

02:53.745 --> 02:55.062
- Thank you.
- What's up?

02:55.086 --> 02:57.026
ATM footage from the bank
in Westwood.

02:57.050 --> 02:59.353
Asher Ross was withdrawing $100

02:59.377 --> 03:02.567
from his checking account
8:07 a.m. Last Thursday

03:02.591 --> 03:04.485
when he got a cell phone call.

03:04.509 --> 03:06.238
It was his last.

03:06.262 --> 03:09.117
He was killed by what appears
to be some sort of explosive device

03:09.141 --> 03:10.429
planted in his phone.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.664
Now, Ross was no stranger
to explosives.

03:13.688 --> 03:16.873
He's a former staff sergeant
with the Marine EOD Unit.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.503
Explosive Ordinance Disposal.

03:19.527 --> 03:22.760
Six months ago he was part
of a convoy

03:22.784 --> 03:24.661
hit by a roadside bomb in Fallujah.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.680
Three Marines were killed,
several others were severely injured.

03:28.704 --> 03:30.262
Ross was given a medical discharge

03:30.286 --> 03:32.228
because he lost hearing
in one of his ears.

03:32.252 --> 03:35.066
Eric, phone records. Find out
where the trigger call originated.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.187
And, Dom, forensics on Ross' phone
and personal belongings.

03:38.211 --> 03:40.461
We'll check out the ATM
where he was killed.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.776
We might be able to get
additional footage

03:45.800 --> 03:48.893
from across the street at the store.
Maybe even the traffic cam.

03:49.896 --> 03:50.987
- Anything?
- Yes.

03:51.011 --> 03:52.541
Ross got a coffee and a muffin,

03:52.565 --> 03:54.915
stopped to buy the L.A. Times
before hitting the ATM.

03:54.939 --> 03:57.518
- What kind of muffin?
- Seriously?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.192
You can tell a lot about a person
by their choice of breakfast pastries.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.874
Take Sam, for instance.

04:02.898 --> 04:04.191
Spicy Cinnabon.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.722
Ignore him.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.799
If Santa was working
the day of the bombing,

04:08.823 --> 04:10.089
he might've seen something.

04:10.113 --> 04:11.762
Maybe our guy's on his naughty list.

04:11.786 --> 04:14.534
Wait, wait. Hold on, Sam.
I checked already. There's nothing.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.601
Eric, what do you got?

04:16.625 --> 04:19.894
The call that
triggered the bomb in Ross' cell phone

04:19.918 --> 04:23.236
originated in the same cell site,
which means that the caller was within

04:23.260 --> 04:24.865
half a mile or so of the explosion.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.524
Could have been closer than that.
He might have been watching.

04:27.548 --> 04:30.109
The killer could have got
a prepaid phone to make the call.

04:30.133 --> 04:32.280
Yeah, I already traced it.
It's a dead end.

04:32.304 --> 04:36.015
The killer used a prepaid cell phone
and placed the call, then threw it away.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.623
There's no way to track it.

04:37.647 --> 04:39.954
Eric, is the trigger phone
still in service?

04:39.978 --> 04:41.958
Uh, doesn't appear to be.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.924
Probably turned it off
before he tossed it.

04:43.948 --> 04:46.501
- You can remotely reactivate it, right?
- Yep.

04:46.525 --> 04:49.349
- Do it.
- All right. I'll try to find the cell phone,

04:49.373 --> 04:52.516
see if we can pull some prints,
track back to where he purchased it.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.663
- I'll go check on Ross' house.
- Yep.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.775
You know,
the most obvious suspect

05:00.799 --> 05:03.779
is gonna be someone
in Ross' bomb disposal unit.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.232
But we cannot forget that he also
studied chemical engineering.

05:07.256 --> 05:09.650
So what? One of his fellow students
had a beef with him

05:09.674 --> 05:11.903
so he cooked up some explosive
and wired his phone?

05:11.927 --> 05:15.638
I think Eric needs to do a background
check on everyone in his classes.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.291
You have to excuse the mess.

05:20.315 --> 05:24.401
My wife was supposed to help me
pack up his things.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.300
Asher was her only son.

05:27.324 --> 05:29.130
She's just not ready yet.

05:29.154 --> 05:32.081
We're very sorry for your loss, sir.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.636
Mr. Ross,
there may be some evidence

05:35.660 --> 05:38.303
in your son's belongings
that could help our investigation.

05:38.327 --> 05:40.877
The police already
went through everything.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.219
Nothing here that'll bring him back.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.713
Do you have any idea who may have
wanted to hurt your son?

05:49.307 --> 05:51.857
I'd like to say
my son didn't have any enemies,

05:51.881 --> 05:55.761
but I wasn't close enough to him
to know.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.056
- You had a falling out?
- No.

06:00.819 --> 06:04.520
Just working a lot, trying to make sure
my family was taken care of.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.545
One day
you're missing Little League

06:08.569 --> 06:10.902
and the next thing you know
they're moving out.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.201
And all that time in-between,

06:15.125 --> 06:16.703
it's just lost.

06:19.504 --> 06:25.210
Did Asher ever talk to you about
his time in the Marines or, uh, school?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.388
No. The last time we talked,

06:29.181 --> 06:31.054
argued.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.319
It was about money.

06:33.343 --> 06:38.322
Uh, he'd lent a lot of his savings
to a Marine buddy

06:38.346 --> 06:40.516
and he wasn't paying him back.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.401
Do you have a name?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.528
King.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.413
But don't ask me first,
last, nickname.

06:48.437 --> 06:51.902
I just know they were together
in Iraq.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.537
Ever since Ash was little
he wanted to be a Marine.

07:02.964 --> 07:06.464
I just wish, uh, he could be 8 again.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.764
We could start over.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.370
Okay, Sam, I just reactivated
the phone that called Asher Ross.

07:18.394 --> 07:21.077
I'm sending its GPS signal
to your phone.

07:21.101 --> 07:23.457
Should be accurate
to within a couple metres.

07:23.481 --> 07:24.956
You see anything?

07:24.980 --> 07:27.703
I've got an alley, lots of garbage.
A couple of dumpsters.

07:27.727 --> 07:29.460
Probably tossed it in one of them.

07:29.484 --> 07:31.069
All right, call the cell phone.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.468
Well, what if it's booby trapped too?

07:33.492 --> 07:34.883
Just do it, Eric.

07:34.907 --> 07:36.823
Okay.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.883
All right, it's ringing.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.125
Sam, you all right?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.700
Restaurant garbage.
It's full of maggots.

08:05.724 --> 08:07.670
I hate maggots. Ugh.

08:07.694 --> 08:10.508
Well, don't think of them
as the M word. Think of them

08:10.532 --> 08:12.217
as the larval form of flies.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.294
Sterile versions are used
in medical procedures

08:14.318 --> 08:15.799
as a form of wound debridement.

08:15.823 --> 08:17.715
- The larva eat...
- Goodbye, Eric.

08:17.739 --> 08:19.457
Hello?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.822
Oh, this is worth it.

08:36.846 --> 08:38.534
- Yeah?
- Eric,

08:38.558 --> 08:41.703
run a search on a guy named King.
He served with Asher Ross.

08:41.727 --> 08:42.904
Yeah, I'm on it.

08:42.928 --> 08:46.997
All right, I've got a Hastings King,
also a member of Ross' EOD unit.

08:47.021 --> 08:50.420
He was severely injured
in the same convoy attack in Fallujah.

08:50.444 --> 08:51.645
You got an address?

08:52.908 --> 08:56.502
Yeah, just off Colorado Avenue.
Not too far from Sam.

08:56.526 --> 08:59.004
Call Sam. Have him check out King.
We're headed back.

08:59.028 --> 09:00.237
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.193
- Hey, Mr. King.
- We're closed. Now get lost.

09:16.217 --> 09:18.192
Your customer service
needs some work.

09:18.216 --> 09:21.368
I'm NCIS. Asher Ross is dead.

09:21.392 --> 09:24.372
Now show me your hands
and come out before I pull you out.

09:24.396 --> 09:27.458
Seriously, you need to get lost now.

09:27.482 --> 09:28.979
I've got a little problem here.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.945
Hey.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.364
Yes, you have.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.897
I called L.A.P.D.
Bomb squad's on the way.

09:51.921 --> 09:54.803
Great. Last thing I need
is some civilian blowing up my garage.

09:55.352 --> 09:58.222
The bomb is probably wired
into the car's ignition.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.072
See anything on the battery?

10:14.663 --> 10:15.663
No.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.009
But it looks like she's tied
into the starter.

10:19.033 --> 10:22.435
There's something the size of
a cell phone wrapped in electrical tape.

10:22.459 --> 10:24.432
Must be a secondary device.

10:24.456 --> 10:25.935
Impressive.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.018
You're lucky I stopped by, King.

10:28.042 --> 10:30.566
This is a two-man job.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.280
The green wire on three?

10:32.304 --> 10:33.823
Nope.

10:33.847 --> 10:35.154
Yellow one for me.

10:35.178 --> 10:38.636
Tricky. Switched the colour
just to be difficult.

10:40.230 --> 10:42.388
- On three?
- Go for it.

10:43.066 --> 10:44.726
One,

10:45.652 --> 10:46.815
two,

10:48.071 --> 10:49.649
three.

10:57.539 --> 11:00.599
Bet you didn't wake up this morning
thinking you might get blown to hell.

11:00.623 --> 11:02.120
Can't say I did.

11:05.922 --> 11:07.974
- How'd you find it?
- It was luck.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.416
I knew I had a tranny leak.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.417
So I rolled underneath
to take a look

11:14.389 --> 11:16.014
and there she was.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.286
Still getting used to the leg.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.619
Glad it didn't slow you down
in the business department.

11:28.643 --> 11:31.145
No. Wall Street took care of that.

11:31.948 --> 11:34.618
Is that why you didn't pay Asher Ross
back the money he lent you?

11:37.454 --> 11:38.616
That's why you're here?

11:40.957 --> 11:43.413
You think I killed Asher Ross
so I didn't have to pay him?

11:43.919 --> 11:45.270
Just covering all the angles.

11:45.294 --> 11:47.514
- Where were you last Thursday?
- Working.

11:47.538 --> 11:48.805
Alone.

11:48.829 --> 11:51.900
And Asher Ross saved my ass
more than once.

11:51.924 --> 11:53.943
He's the only one
who took a chance

11:53.967 --> 11:56.842
and loaned me the bucks
to get started.

11:57.474 --> 12:01.661
Yeah, got a little behind
in my payments.

12:01.685 --> 12:03.656
You think I'd kill him over that?

12:03.680 --> 12:06.891
- Any idea who would?
- No.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.976
I'm gonna need to take that back
for analysis.

12:10.987 --> 12:13.027
Don't drop it.

12:13.573 --> 12:15.198
Okay.

12:15.951 --> 12:19.461
This is what's left of Asher
Ross' laptop from the explosion.

12:19.485 --> 12:21.097
Getting anything is gonna be tough.

12:21.121 --> 12:24.100
Preliminary forensics show
Ross' cell phone fragments

12:24.124 --> 12:25.597
had traces of HMX.

12:25.621 --> 12:29.304
HMX is a military-grade explosive
and it's expensive and hard to get.

12:29.328 --> 12:32.269
Which means our bomber
needed access or he ripped it off.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.148
- I'll check reports for theft.
- All right.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.527
The killer had to have access
to Ross' cell phone

12:37.551 --> 12:40.106
in order to wire it with an explosive
without Ross knowing.

12:40.130 --> 12:43.819
- What about the phone Sam found?
- Nothing. Prepaid, no prints.

12:43.843 --> 12:46.452
Killer must have wiped it clean
before tossing it.

12:46.476 --> 12:48.284
Keep working on that laptop, Eric.

12:48.308 --> 12:51.793
Ross and King were on the same
bomb disposal unit for nine months.

12:51.817 --> 12:53.457
Now it sounds
like a short time, but...

12:53.481 --> 12:55.624
Considering the burn-out rate,
they're old timers.

12:55.648 --> 12:59.133
Disabling bombs that blow you to hell
with the slightest mistake takes its toll.

12:59.157 --> 13:01.212
The work often results in PTSD.

13:01.236 --> 13:04.555
King appears to be coping,
but given all that he's suffered...

13:04.579 --> 13:07.430
Some of the more severe symptoms
might take months to manifest.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.225
Untreated, it can cause
massive personality change.

13:10.249 --> 13:12.271
- Depression, aggression.
- Aggressive enough

13:12.295 --> 13:14.600
to blow your buddy's heads off
if you've got a beef?

13:14.624 --> 13:15.999
It's not out of the question.

13:19.723 --> 13:23.008
- Full Windsor.
- Really? Again with the tie?

13:23.602 --> 13:25.535
I had you pegged
more as a Half Windsor guy.

13:25.559 --> 13:27.578
Is that supposed to have
some sort of meaning?

13:27.602 --> 13:29.516
You're the psychologist.

13:35.530 --> 13:36.905
Wow. Um...

13:38.575 --> 13:41.801
Shouldn't you be working on that
somewhere a little more secure?

13:41.825 --> 13:43.631
- Like where?
- I don't know.

13:43.655 --> 13:46.368
A room with armour-plated walls
comes to mind.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.131
Light's good in here.

13:48.155 --> 13:50.292
I will buy you a lamp.

13:51.129 --> 13:52.268
King said it was defused.

13:52.292 --> 13:54.836
He seemed to know
what he was doing. Relax.

13:57.510 --> 14:00.298
The million-dollar question is
do you know what you're doing?

14:03.266 --> 14:05.947
- This is not good.
- Sam?

14:05.971 --> 14:09.180
He hid a secondary
micro-detonator inside.

14:10.315 --> 14:12.521
It has a mercury switch.

14:13.443 --> 14:15.768
Don't anybody move.

14:17.822 --> 14:19.341
Hey! Oops.

14:19.365 --> 14:20.777
Sorry about that.

14:23.328 --> 14:25.237
Full Windsor.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.091
It's a Christmas miracle.

14:29.115 --> 14:30.928
We got something off Ross' laptop.

14:30.952 --> 14:34.223
He had lunch two days
before he died with Stanton Olin

14:34.247 --> 14:36.724
who is another member
of his EOD unit in Iraq.

14:36.748 --> 14:38.668
That's access and ability.

14:39.302 --> 14:40.465
If Olin's got motive,

14:42.138 --> 14:43.443
he's our guy.

14:43.467 --> 14:47.175
It wasn't really a miracle.
It was just me doing what I do.

14:49.896 --> 14:51.011
That shirt is awesome.

14:55.527 --> 14:58.693
Nate. What's up, dude?

14:59.823 --> 15:03.333
Hmm. Psych evaluations
are coming up in a few weeks,

15:03.357 --> 15:06.962
and, uh, I'll be interviewing
team members.

15:06.986 --> 15:10.117
- And for that you need my signature.
- Yeah.

15:12.252 --> 15:15.395
And, um, who interviews you,
Mr. Getz?

15:15.419 --> 15:16.751
It doesn't work that way.

15:17.215 --> 15:20.251
Doesn't seem fair somehow,
does it?

15:23.013 --> 15:24.613
What'd you do to your tie?

15:24.637 --> 15:26.822
Oh, I, uh, spilled something on it.

15:26.846 --> 15:28.451
Yeah.

15:28.475 --> 15:31.027
Should I get it, uh, dry-cleaned?

15:31.051 --> 15:32.580
Well, that's an option.

15:32.604 --> 15:34.373
Soda water?

15:34.397 --> 15:39.204
I'd recommend either donation
or incineration, not in that order.

15:39.228 --> 15:41.752
You don't like this tie? It was a gift.

15:41.776 --> 15:44.617
Obviously not from a loved one.

15:46.286 --> 15:50.330
Oh, come on. Let's go cheer you up.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.391
You're wondering about the suit?

15:53.415 --> 15:57.012
Oh, no. A man doesn't need an excuse
to be fashionable.

15:57.036 --> 16:00.274
And besides,
you look so professional.

16:00.298 --> 16:02.186
I tried the whole
West Coast casual thing,

16:02.210 --> 16:04.401
and I think it was
working against me.

16:04.425 --> 16:07.027
- You know, with the agents.
- Ah.

16:07.051 --> 16:10.319
I know undercover work
is difficult and dangerous

16:10.343 --> 16:12.820
and I know they've been forced
to take on roles

16:12.844 --> 16:14.906
and do things
that they're not proud of.

16:14.930 --> 16:18.747
But they think that burying memories
is better than talking about them.

16:18.771 --> 16:22.039
Come.
Let's try a Half Windsor this time.

16:22.063 --> 16:25.239
It can make such a difference.

16:25.825 --> 16:27.023
There you go.

16:28.411 --> 16:33.263
You know, in my experience,
if you're patient,

16:33.287 --> 16:38.037
sooner or later the people
who need to talk will seek you out.

16:39.089 --> 16:42.564
Often under the guise
of some other intention.

16:42.588 --> 16:45.879
You just have to listen.

16:53.103 --> 16:54.656
You think I could pull off a bow tie?

16:54.680 --> 16:58.389
Not without a red rubber nose
and those big floppy shoes.

17:03.238 --> 17:05.693
Olin's got quite the view.

17:06.407 --> 17:10.536
Yeah. He can sit on his porch at night
and watch the drive-bys.

17:21.631 --> 17:26.210
Olin? Federal agents. Stop. Olin.

17:41.818 --> 17:43.360
Come on.

17:48.783 --> 17:52.033
Eric, get me an ambulance.

18:03.739 --> 18:08.044
So your buddy Ross gets
killed, we turn up and you take off?

18:08.068 --> 18:09.322
So why'd you run?

18:10.078 --> 18:11.632
Someone's been following me.

18:11.656 --> 18:14.344
Ross ever mention anything
about being followed?

18:14.368 --> 18:16.426
He just said I was being paranoid.

18:16.450 --> 18:18.500
Now who's being paranoid?

18:19.921 --> 18:21.605
Who is doing this?

18:21.629 --> 18:23.590
Who wants us dead?

18:27.220 --> 18:30.221
Footage from an L.A.P.D. Traffic cam.

18:30.724 --> 18:32.194
Not likely triggered by a timer.

18:32.218 --> 18:35.571
There's no way of knowing exactly
when he'd get back into his car again.

18:35.595 --> 18:37.027
It's not rigged to the starter,

18:37.051 --> 18:39.662
otherwise it would've blown up
as soon as he turned the key.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.661
Could've been remote detonation,
same as Ross.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.319
Rewind.

18:46.031 --> 18:47.525
Back window of the car.

18:49.284 --> 18:50.540
Clean it up, Eric.

18:50.564 --> 18:54.136
Hmm. Probably some neighbourhood
kids. "Wash me." Things like that.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.216
You know,
when I was in high school,

18:56.240 --> 18:59.844
I wrote "I wish my girlfriend
were this dirty" on my principal's car.

18:59.868 --> 19:03.580
And I thought it was pretty funny
until I got expelled.

19:11.515 --> 19:14.931
It's from the Qur'an.
Al-Maeda, chapter five, verse ten.

19:15.435 --> 19:17.368
Those who reject our faith
and deny our signs

19:17.392 --> 19:19.306
shall be companions of hellfire.

19:20.857 --> 19:22.209
Seems like Ross and his buddies

19:22.233 --> 19:24.808
might have brought back more
from Iraq than they realised.

19:26.696 --> 19:29.128
I'm here to help you, Olin,

19:29.152 --> 19:30.735
but you're gonna have to trust me.

19:39.751 --> 19:41.459
It's my fault Ross is dead.

19:42.212 --> 19:43.351
Why do you think that?

19:43.375 --> 19:45.811
Because I didn't try hard enough
to convince him

19:45.835 --> 19:47.228
that something was going on.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.632
He shut me down.

19:50.387 --> 19:51.822
So I stopped trying.

19:51.846 --> 19:54.635
Maybe it's because you didn't want
to believe it yourself.

19:57.394 --> 20:00.240
Sometimes it's easier to pretend
something's not happening

20:00.264 --> 20:01.470
than to face it.

20:02.858 --> 20:04.649
Yeah, well, I just faced it.

20:05.152 --> 20:06.836
Okay.

20:06.860 --> 20:10.563
Just like I faced it every day
out there.

20:11.324 --> 20:12.735
Every day.

20:17.747 --> 20:20.131
My partner and I spent a little time
in Fallujah.

20:20.155 --> 20:23.868
We were augmenting
a Marine Expeditionary Force.

20:26.131 --> 20:28.728
We had more bad days
than good ones.

20:28.752 --> 20:31.796
The last thing I wanted to do
was talk about it, but, uh...

20:35.140 --> 20:36.848
It helped.

20:37.350 --> 20:39.806
The only way to quiet it

20:40.520 --> 20:41.552
was to get it out.

20:43.690 --> 20:48.043
I'm afraid
that if I get even a glimpse of light

20:48.067 --> 20:49.351
it'll swallow me.

20:50.447 --> 20:52.083
I know.

20:52.107 --> 20:55.153
I guess everyone deals with it
differently.

20:55.452 --> 20:58.287
King threw himself
into his business.

20:59.039 --> 21:01.328
I found God.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.167
Ross did the best.
He just moved on.

21:08.715 --> 21:10.209
Before the bombing,

21:10.884 --> 21:14.478
somebody wrote a warning in Arabic
on the back of your vehicle.

21:14.502 --> 21:17.087
It was a warning from the Qur'an.

21:17.849 --> 21:19.806
Do you have any idea
who might have left that?

21:23.063 --> 21:25.815
There was a guy in our unit, Tariq.

21:26.775 --> 21:28.399
He was Muslim.

21:28.902 --> 21:31.167
I didn't know him very well.
No one did.

21:31.191 --> 21:33.047
Have you seen him
since you've been back?

21:33.071 --> 21:35.695
I knew he had family here in L.A.

21:36.284 --> 21:39.380
I don't even know if I would recognise
him if he walked by me in the street.

21:39.404 --> 21:41.786
Why wouldn't you recognise him,
Olin?

21:44.292 --> 21:45.870
IED.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.888
He was badly burned
in the explosion.

21:48.912 --> 21:52.422
His back, his arms, his face.

21:55.095 --> 21:57.668
Maybe he blames us for that.

22:00.142 --> 22:02.953
Tariq Barad Al-jabiri.
Born and raised in Michigan.

22:02.977 --> 22:05.197
Followed his older brother
to Los Angeles in '06

22:05.221 --> 22:06.950
where he joined up
a few months later.

22:06.974 --> 22:09.117
Service record's clean as a whistle.

22:09.141 --> 22:11.666
Last known address was a house
in Mar Vista.

22:11.690 --> 22:14.673
The name on the lease
is Kimberly Johnson.

22:14.697 --> 22:15.979
Great.

22:17.075 --> 22:19.838
I haven't seen Tariq since he got back.

22:19.862 --> 22:21.590
The corps told me he'd been hurt.

22:21.614 --> 22:23.697
That he'd been disfigured.

22:24.374 --> 22:27.304
I tried to see him in the hospital,
but he wouldn't allow it.

22:27.328 --> 22:29.958
He wouldn't see me.
He wouldn't take my calls.

22:30.714 --> 22:32.564
He didn't even respond
to my e-mails.

22:32.588 --> 22:35.022
Mommy,
when are we gonna see Santa?

22:35.046 --> 22:37.566
Real soon, honey. Why don't you go
put on your blue dress

22:37.590 --> 22:40.218
- so you can get your picture taken?
- Okay.

22:44.019 --> 22:46.770
My daughter Elly is Tariq's niece.

22:47.689 --> 22:49.812
I was in a relationship
with Tariq's brother.

22:50.317 --> 22:53.578
After he found out I was pregnant,
he was out of here fast.

22:53.602 --> 22:55.913
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so was I.

22:55.937 --> 22:57.999
I thought he loved me.

22:58.023 --> 23:00.963
But Tariq stepped up
and supported us.

23:00.987 --> 23:04.755
Treated Elly like she was his own.

23:04.779 --> 23:06.557
After a while...

23:06.581 --> 23:08.303
You fell in love.

23:08.327 --> 23:10.827
Yeah, very much so.

23:11.546 --> 23:13.230
We were building
a great life together.

23:13.254 --> 23:15.879
Then he shipped off to Iraq.

23:16.510 --> 23:20.863
And now he's finally back,
but he's still gone.

23:20.887 --> 23:24.923
I just want him to come home
so that we can be a family again.

23:25.310 --> 23:28.370
Did Tariq get along with all the guys
in his unit?

23:28.394 --> 23:32.204
Were there any conflicts
over religious beliefs?

23:32.228 --> 23:34.499
Tariq was very tolerant.

23:34.523 --> 23:37.185
He even let Elly
have a Christmas tree.

23:39.324 --> 23:40.652
He loved her.

23:43.078 --> 23:45.403
He still drops money off for us
every month.

23:51.294 --> 23:54.105
Security cam footage
from Cali South Mailboxes.

23:54.129 --> 23:56.943
According to Kim Johnson,
Tariq drops cash off here

23:56.967 --> 23:58.485
for his family once a month.

23:58.509 --> 24:00.941
- And this was two days ago?
- Yeah.

24:00.965 --> 24:02.276
Could be our guy.

24:02.300 --> 24:05.698
Tariq goes over to fight for his country,
but he gets badly disfigured.

24:05.722 --> 24:09.807
Starts to question his belief in the war,
America, even his fellow Marines.

24:10.313 --> 24:11.452
Forgets whose side he's on.

24:11.476 --> 24:13.617
Maybe we
should stake out the store.

24:13.641 --> 24:16.200
It's too long to wait.
Somebody could be dead by tomorrow.

24:16.224 --> 24:17.517
The clock is ticking.

24:19.823 --> 24:21.566
We could make a special delivery.

24:26.413 --> 24:27.848
- Is that a...?
- Yep.

24:27.872 --> 24:29.510
It's a bomb, Paul.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.389
We believe this bomb may have come
from one of your mailboxes.

24:32.413 --> 24:33.842
And who are you guys?

24:33.866 --> 24:35.302
We work with Homeland Security.

24:35.326 --> 24:37.249
I think I should call my boss.

24:38.967 --> 24:41.778
- Recognise this guy?
- Ugh.

24:41.802 --> 24:42.977
That's a trick question.

24:43.001 --> 24:45.338
How can you recognise him
when half his head's gone.

24:45.849 --> 24:48.340
Box 117.
I want a name and address.

24:49.936 --> 24:52.664
Strong possibility there's another one
of these coming next week.

24:52.688 --> 24:54.955
Strong possibility there's a bomb
just like this

24:54.979 --> 24:57.771
in one of those mailboxes right now.

24:58.945 --> 25:00.985
I'd hurry up, Paul.

25:04.493 --> 25:06.011
"Rented by Asher Ross."

25:06.035 --> 25:07.365
Déjà vu.

25:21.510 --> 25:22.980
Clear.

25:23.004 --> 25:24.802
- Clear.
- G.

25:27.241 --> 25:28.700
Found this in Asher's bedroom.

25:29.643 --> 25:32.265
Looks like our boy Tariq's
found a place to stay.

25:34.621 --> 25:36.697
And work.

25:49.061 --> 25:52.038
So we have Ross,
a former Marine EOD specialist

25:52.062 --> 25:53.701
who's blown up with his own phone.

25:53.725 --> 25:55.749
Then we have another member
of his unit, Olin,

25:55.773 --> 25:58.207
who's nearly blown to hell
in his own car.

25:58.231 --> 26:01.214
Now we have our boy King
who finds a bomb under his truck

26:01.238 --> 26:03.292
and disarms it with help
from yours truly.

26:03.316 --> 26:06.243
That leaves Tariq, who we now know
is staying at Ross' place

26:06.828 --> 26:07.836
and working with King.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.722
So Tariq is the common vector.

26:09.746 --> 26:11.089
Why didn't King mention him?

26:11.113 --> 26:13.390
These guys have been to hell
and back together.

26:13.414 --> 26:15.969
King didn't tell Tariq's family.
Why would he tell us?

26:15.993 --> 26:17.641
If they were buddies,
why would Tariq

26:17.665 --> 26:19.583
place a bomb under King's truck?

26:20.092 --> 26:23.211
I think it's time someone pays
another visit to King.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.421
You don't still have that, uh,
wench outfit, do you?

26:46.034 --> 26:47.125
Can I help you?

26:47.149 --> 26:51.325
Yeah, this thing's been coughing
and jumping like a Brahma bull.

26:52.749 --> 26:54.872
So, uh, is Tariq here?

26:55.419 --> 26:58.312
Sort of tall, dark, handsome.

26:58.336 --> 27:00.830
I'm the only handsome one here.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.565
In fact,
I'm the only one working here.

27:03.589 --> 27:07.900
Oh. Because you see, I met this guy,
Tariq, at a gas station,

27:07.924 --> 27:10.067
and he was wearing a shirt
with your logo on it.

27:10.091 --> 27:11.618
Quality Automotive.

27:11.642 --> 27:13.364
So that's how I knew to come here.

27:13.388 --> 27:17.809
Never had anybody named Tariq
working here. Sorry.

27:18.859 --> 27:21.789
When was the last time you put
some carburettor cleaner through this?

27:21.813 --> 27:23.042
I don't know.

27:23.066 --> 27:25.966
I've been out of town
so it's been sitting for about a month.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.818
Leave your man
waiting a month too?

27:28.660 --> 27:31.756
This bike has Twin Cains on it.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.591
The carburettor looks all right.

27:33.615 --> 27:36.602
Let's take a look
at the throttle-control rod.

27:36.626 --> 27:38.786
- You in the corps?
- Yep.

27:40.339 --> 27:42.188
Don't tell me you're a Marine too.

27:42.212 --> 27:43.877
My father was.

27:44.384 --> 27:46.341
I grew up moving from base to base.

27:47.721 --> 27:50.983
I was even, uh, engaged
to a jarhead once.

27:51.007 --> 27:52.594
He managed to escape?

27:54.061 --> 27:55.306
Killed at Fallujah.

27:56.647 --> 27:57.678
I'm sorry.

27:58.815 --> 28:01.579
Let's see what's, uh,
giving this bike indigestion.

28:01.603 --> 28:04.528
Is that true
about Kensi being engaged?

28:05.364 --> 28:09.657
I don't know. But if it is,
it explains all the serial dating.

28:10.661 --> 28:12.795
Here's your problem right here.

28:12.819 --> 28:15.012
These spark plugs aren't stock.

28:15.036 --> 28:18.931
You gotta stick with factory
or the ion sensors misread.

28:18.955 --> 28:20.325
You get a bumpy ride.

28:21.171 --> 28:23.353
You know,
Tariq said he was a Marine.

28:23.377 --> 28:27.024
And now, I know you devil dogs
stick together, so, uh...

28:27.048 --> 28:30.006
Come on. Hook a girl up.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.551
All right.

28:36.895 --> 28:39.813
Hey, I've got somebody down here
who wants to talk to you.

28:40.524 --> 28:41.614
That's our girl.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.224
- Want a beer?
- Drink and drive?

28:46.321 --> 28:49.239
Hey, Tariq.
Here she is, you lucky dog.

28:52.119 --> 28:53.150
Who are you?

28:55.205 --> 28:58.182
Tariq, we're NCIS agents.

28:58.206 --> 28:59.490
Hey.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.249
Who are you?

29:04.965 --> 29:05.972
I told you he'd run.

29:05.996 --> 29:08.416
I know. I know.
I hate when they run.

29:08.927 --> 29:12.343
What's the matter with you?
Throwing a hammer at my head.

29:13.140 --> 29:14.550
You lying bitch.

29:15.934 --> 29:18.259
You set me up.

29:18.562 --> 29:21.325
I'm NCIS,
but my father was a Marine.

29:21.349 --> 29:22.958
Oh, yeah?

29:22.982 --> 29:27.942
How does he feel about his daughter
growing up to be a professional liar?

29:31.867 --> 29:33.503
Good news, Mr. Olin.

29:33.527 --> 29:35.469
Tariq's been taken into custody.

29:35.493 --> 29:38.865
- Tariq?
- In relation to Ross' murder.

29:45.172 --> 29:47.710
Me and Ross,
we were coming back from a patrol.

29:49.426 --> 29:52.795
We saw these two old ladies
huddled in a doorway.

29:54.556 --> 29:56.134
We offered them
a couple candy bars

29:57.434 --> 30:01.266
and I think they just appreciated
the gesture.

30:02.564 --> 30:04.023
But, um...

30:08.904 --> 30:10.896
It's okay, Olin.

30:11.740 --> 30:13.115
Take your time.

30:15.035 --> 30:17.882
Out of nowhere,
this other lady comes.

30:17.906 --> 30:20.618
And she's younger. With a baby.

30:22.417 --> 30:24.635
And Tariq starts shouting at her
in Arabic,

30:24.659 --> 30:27.220
telling her to move away and stuff.
"Move away! Move away!"

30:27.244 --> 30:28.940
Everything to him
was a security risk.

30:28.964 --> 30:30.935
The woman with the baby
wanted your help?

30:30.959 --> 30:33.020
Everybody was shouting.

30:33.044 --> 30:36.340
And the old ladies were crying

30:37.057 --> 30:40.011
and I was just trying
to get them all to settle down.

30:44.439 --> 30:47.939
And then Tariq starts firing his gun
right by my head.

30:49.319 --> 30:51.146
Ross too.

30:51.947 --> 30:54.272
When I turned back around,

30:58.245 --> 30:59.324
they're all dead.

31:01.123 --> 31:03.056
The woman,

31:03.080 --> 31:05.373
the baby,

31:06.336 --> 31:08.376
the old ladies.

31:13.635 --> 31:16.233
I guess
I just never really got a chance

31:16.257 --> 31:17.888
to talk to anybody about this.

31:18.390 --> 31:19.469
You should.

31:22.019 --> 31:23.347
You need to.

31:30.068 --> 31:32.108
I want you to have this.

31:33.238 --> 31:34.377
You read the Bible?

31:34.401 --> 31:36.696
I've skimmed.

31:37.242 --> 31:39.863
I have, uh, poor reading habits.

31:42.664 --> 31:46.033
It would mean a lot to me
if you took it.

31:47.336 --> 31:50.040
It's helped me out
through a lot of tough times.

31:51.632 --> 31:53.790
Who knows,
maybe it'll help you some day.

31:58.889 --> 32:00.680
Thank you.

32:02.851 --> 32:04.393
I appreciate it.

32:21.286 --> 32:23.243
He would have been very proud.

32:25.165 --> 32:27.632
And you look like
you could use some tea.

32:27.656 --> 32:32.627
This is a holiday blend
with cinnamon and safflower petals.

32:33.632 --> 32:37.356
- Well, thank you.
- Well, you're welcome.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.936
Congratulations.

32:39.960 --> 32:43.507
It seems you may have caught
our mad bomber.

32:46.687 --> 32:50.636
- You don't seem very thrilled.
- No.

32:52.109 --> 32:54.516
I mean, yes. I hope so.

32:55.445 --> 32:59.692
I just wish that l...
You know what? I don't know.

33:01.076 --> 33:04.088
I just think that when it comes
to going undercover,

33:04.112 --> 33:06.957
I deal with the danger a lot better
than the deception.

33:08.333 --> 33:09.578
I see.

33:10.043 --> 33:14.041
Like with Hastings King,
for example. Today.

33:15.048 --> 33:18.191
Some of what I told him was true,
some of it was a complete lie,

33:18.215 --> 33:20.508
and some of it was a...

33:21.263 --> 33:22.899
Was a combination of both.

33:22.923 --> 33:27.024
Deception you perpetrate
is a necessity, Kensi.

33:27.048 --> 33:31.035
You need to embrace it, not fear it.

33:31.059 --> 33:33.307
I'm sure your father would agree.

33:38.363 --> 33:40.711
Anyway, if men wanted the truth
all the time,

33:40.735 --> 33:46.661
I wouldn't have a French maid's outfit
in my boudoir, would I?

33:49.333 --> 33:53.959
- You have a...?
- Just drink your tea, dear heart.

33:56.423 --> 33:58.557
Forensics reports are in
on the explosives.

33:58.581 --> 34:00.312
- Two different types were used.
- Two?

34:00.336 --> 34:02.088
Yeah.

34:05.057 --> 34:07.844
Tell me about Ross and King.

34:10.228 --> 34:12.980
Ross and King let me couch surf
between their two places.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.225
You and Ross are friends?

34:15.734 --> 34:17.891
Ross saved my life.

34:18.612 --> 34:20.913
He saved Olin and King too.

34:20.937 --> 34:23.925
When he pulled King out,
the guy's leg was still underneath me.

34:23.949 --> 34:25.422
Wow.

34:25.446 --> 34:29.154
Ross pulled Olin and King out first.

34:29.581 --> 34:31.929
- Do you resent that?
- No.

34:31.953 --> 34:35.351
Had he pulled you out sooner, you
might not have suffered the burns.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.418
If he hadn't pulled me out,
I'd be dead.

34:38.882 --> 34:41.478
No, that dude is a fricking hero.

34:41.503 --> 34:42.981
Okay, let's go back before that.

34:43.005 --> 34:46.677
Tell me about the Iraqi woman
and her baby.

34:47.224 --> 34:48.848
What woman?

34:49.518 --> 34:51.321
You don't remember?

34:51.344 --> 34:54.246
Olin and King were handing out
candy bars

34:54.271 --> 34:57.286
to a couple of old ladies
and you disapproved.

34:57.310 --> 34:59.832
Yeah, that sort of stuff looks great
in the news,

34:59.856 --> 35:01.522
but it's a security risk.

35:02.030 --> 35:03.121
Old ladies?

35:03.145 --> 35:05.624
When you move away
from the vehicle,

35:05.648 --> 35:08.293
you never know
who's on the other side of that door,

35:08.317 --> 35:11.009
or who's looking down at you
from a rooftop.

35:11.033 --> 35:12.724
- That why you shot her?
- I didn't.

35:12.748 --> 35:14.173
You ordered her to step away.

35:14.197 --> 35:17.685
And when she didn't,
you shot a mother and her baby.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.789
There was no baby.

35:22.384 --> 35:24.981
She was carrying
a 60 mm mortar shell

35:25.005 --> 35:26.838
wrapped in a blanket
with a hand trigger.

35:28.515 --> 35:29.950
And I didn't shoot her.

35:29.974 --> 35:31.684
Olin did.

35:33.103 --> 35:34.988
He saved me.

35:35.012 --> 35:39.209
He saved the old ladies
and everybody else for half a block.

35:39.233 --> 35:42.497
- Olin shot a suicide bomber?
- Yeah.

35:42.521 --> 35:43.775
Ask King.

35:45.032 --> 35:47.867
Or check your patrol logs
if you don't believe me.

35:48.410 --> 35:50.153
Did Olin ever talk religion to you?

35:50.662 --> 35:53.236
Yeah. He was a Christian.

35:54.082 --> 35:58.661
But he could quote the Qur'an
or the Talmud as easily as the Bible.

36:07.471 --> 36:09.985
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

36:10.009 --> 36:11.568
Hey, guys?

36:11.592 --> 36:14.031
We got the forensics from the bombs
in Ross' cell phone,

36:14.055 --> 36:15.662
King's truck and Olin's car.

36:15.686 --> 36:19.495
Ross' cell phone and King's car bomb
were both high-grade explosives.

36:19.519 --> 36:21.126
Tetrahexamine tetranitramine.

36:21.150 --> 36:25.126
But the explosive in Olin's car
was trinitrotoluene.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.255
- It's a much lower grade.
- Right.

36:27.279 --> 36:30.046
And it was a shape charge
under the rear of the vehicle

36:30.070 --> 36:31.762
pointing away from the driver.

36:31.786 --> 36:33.745
So it blew out of the car
instead of in.

36:34.289 --> 36:36.056
So basically it looks convincing,

36:36.080 --> 36:38.716
but whoever set it must have known
it wouldn't kill Olin.

36:38.740 --> 36:42.679
Everything Olin told me was either
a distorted memory or an outright lie.

36:42.703 --> 36:45.526
He reads and writes in Arabic.
He could have written the note.

36:45.550 --> 36:48.255
Tariq's not the bomber.

36:49.262 --> 36:51.089
Olin is.

37:07.754 --> 37:09.723
What are the chances
this place is wired?

37:09.747 --> 37:12.106
I'd say between 99 and 100 percent.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.676
Always the optimist.

37:27.607 --> 37:29.933
All right. Room's clear.

37:34.823 --> 37:37.171
- Olin? You in there?
- NCIS.

37:37.195 --> 37:40.570
Agents Callen and Hanna.
We're coming in to talk.

37:41.246 --> 37:42.361
Go.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.502
Wait.

37:52.257 --> 37:54.771
- Pressure padding.
- Thanks.

37:54.795 --> 37:56.546
Yeah.

38:02.184 --> 38:04.152
- Clear.
- Sam.

38:04.176 --> 38:06.535
Got a list of names and cities.

38:06.559 --> 38:08.995
We've got King, Ross, Tariq.

38:09.019 --> 38:11.433
I'll bet the rest
are all Marines as well.

38:14.655 --> 38:16.919
- Hit me, G.
- Yeah, see if our boy Olin

38:16.943 --> 38:18.751
is on any flight manifests tonight.

38:18.775 --> 38:20.302
These are receipts from today.

38:20.326 --> 38:23.221
Eight bottles of peroxide
from Fairfax Beauty Supply.

38:23.245 --> 38:25.382
So now we're chasing a blond?

38:25.406 --> 38:28.179
These are the ingredients
for making TATP.

38:28.203 --> 38:31.057
He must have ran out of HMX
so now he's improvising.

38:31.081 --> 38:34.896
TATP is highly explosive
but it's extremely unstable.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.641
All right. I've got Stanton Olin
on a flight to Atlanta.

38:37.665 --> 38:40.490
Tonight, 11:55 p.m. Delta Airlines.

38:40.514 --> 38:43.681
Okay. Alert airport police at LAX.

38:45.143 --> 38:47.029
Hey, listen to this.

38:47.053 --> 38:52.661
"In flaming fire taking vengeance
on them that know not God."

38:52.685 --> 38:54.958
Sounds like the Qur'an quote
Olin put on his car.

38:54.982 --> 38:58.047
It's essentially the same
only this is from Thessalonians.

38:58.071 --> 38:59.591
- Oh, boy.
- What?

38:59.615 --> 39:02.488
The Bible was a gift from Olin.

39:03.370 --> 39:06.821
Giving away prized possessions,
it's a warning sign of suicide.

39:07.666 --> 39:10.477
Olin doesn't wanna harm
innocent people.

39:10.501 --> 39:12.721
He wants to punish himself
and those in his unit

39:12.745 --> 39:15.388
out of some strange,
twisted sense of penance.

39:15.412 --> 39:19.125
Okay, you know what? Call Callen.
I'm going to King's garage.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.608
Nate?

39:26.632 --> 39:29.538
Olin wants to finish what he started
with Hastings King.

39:29.562 --> 39:30.785
Kensi's headed there now.

39:30.809 --> 39:34.101
Got it. We're on our way.
Sam, let's go.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.900
King?

39:42.826 --> 39:44.427
King.

39:44.451 --> 39:46.505
Hey, come on. We've gotta go.

39:46.529 --> 39:47.760
What are you doing here?

39:47.784 --> 39:50.637
I need to get you out of here now
before Olin arrives to kill you.

39:50.661 --> 39:54.226
- Why in the hell should I trust you?
- Because I'm telling you the truth.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.686
- Since when?
- I was undercover.

39:56.710 --> 39:59.942
I was trying to solve Ross' murder,
and I really don't want to solve yours.

39:59.966 --> 40:02.970
- Okay? So move.
- King.

40:05.015 --> 40:06.046
Olin?

40:09.311 --> 40:10.853
You do not wanna do this.

40:11.730 --> 40:12.845
I don't want to,

40:15.025 --> 40:16.056
but I have to.

40:18.362 --> 40:21.232
I don't know
what you're wired with, Olin,

40:22.366 --> 40:24.418
but you of all people know
that a suicide bomb

40:24.442 --> 40:27.085
is not the way of a real warrior.

40:27.109 --> 40:29.469
The stuff he's wired with is unstable.

40:29.493 --> 40:32.310
- Put a bullet in it, it could go off.
- What about a head shot?

40:32.334 --> 40:35.502
Just the impact of him falling
could trigger it.

40:35.837 --> 40:38.957
You're just chock-full of good news,
aren't you?

40:43.220 --> 40:46.256
You can leave. It's just King and I

40:46.932 --> 40:49.481
who seek absolution
for what we did in Iraq.

40:49.505 --> 40:52.804
No one gets absolution
by killing themselves.

40:54.106 --> 40:55.540
But we did bad things.

40:55.564 --> 40:57.535
It was a war.

40:57.559 --> 41:00.035
It brings out the worst in men
but this isn't gonna help.

41:00.059 --> 41:02.194
Without the shedding of blood,

41:04.032 --> 41:05.111
there is no remission.

41:06.451 --> 41:07.696
Kensi, elbow.

41:09.413 --> 41:10.444
Get the trigger.

41:27.431 --> 41:29.756
Eric, we need an ambulance.

41:30.267 --> 41:33.030
- Looks like Hetty's still here.
- She worries.

41:33.054 --> 41:35.031
Not that she'd ever let us know.

41:35.055 --> 41:38.456
I had some paperwork
to be completed before tomorrow.

41:38.480 --> 41:42.671
Mr. Callen, some of us
take our paperwork seriously.

41:42.695 --> 41:45.840
But with the successful outcome
of our mission

41:45.864 --> 41:47.254
and everyone's safe return,

41:47.278 --> 41:50.096
I thought perhaps some tea
might be in order.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.670
No offence but I don't think tea
is gonna cut it tonight.

41:52.694 --> 41:57.060
Well, it's very special tea,
Mr. Hanna.

41:57.084 --> 42:01.308
Glen Garioch, 1958.

42:01.332 --> 42:03.309
Wow, that is some Scotch, Hetty.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.192
That's what Oliver Reed thought

42:05.216 --> 42:09.193
when he tried to make me
his special musketeer one night.

42:09.217 --> 42:12.141
But he kept his sword
in his scabbard,

42:12.809 --> 42:14.683
and I kept the Scotch.

42:16.688 --> 42:19.120
Looks like you also started
without us, Hetty.

42:19.144 --> 42:21.699
Oh, well, I got bored
with my paperwork.

42:21.723 --> 42:26.445
I figured I'd try
and dress up this abomination.

42:27.491 --> 42:30.218
- Holy moly.
- Wow.

42:30.242 --> 42:32.295
Where's Nate?

42:32.319 --> 42:35.532
He's been known
to enjoy a good single malt.

42:36.166 --> 42:37.470
He's busy.

42:37.494 --> 42:40.289
Spreading some cheer of his own.

43:00.065 --> 43:01.180
Oh, Tariq.

43:03.568 --> 43:05.727
Welcome home.

43:11.701 --> 43:13.337
Go home,

43:13.361 --> 43:15.256
find a wench,

43:15.280 --> 43:17.305
raise fat babies,

43:17.329 --> 43:22.706
live a good long life.
