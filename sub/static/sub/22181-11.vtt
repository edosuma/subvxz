WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:04.372
My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.640
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.243
I was sent to earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.245
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.446
And by the time I got here,

00:12.480 --> 00:17.551
my cousin had already grown up
and become... Superman.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.121
I hid who I really was,
until one day

00:20.154 --> 00:23.591
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.261
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.295 --> 00:30.064
But in secret I work with
my adopted sister

00:30.098 --> 00:32.733
for the D.E.O. to protect
my city from alien life

00:32.766 --> 00:35.169
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.572
I am Supergirl.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.809
Previously on Supergirl...

00:41.842 --> 00:44.412
I know that you and Mon-El
used to be together.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.080
But when he first arrived
in my time,

00:46.114 --> 00:48.382
he spoke only
of finding a way
back to you.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.086
I met
a Kryptonian priestess

00:52.120 --> 00:54.688
who told me about the God
who ends everything.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.756
Worldkiller.

00:55.789 --> 01:00.594
All I am is truth and judgment,
and I will reign.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.839
Enter!

01:11.872 --> 01:13.241
Hey!
-Hi.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.842
Look who I found.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.344
And we come bearing carbs.

01:16.377 --> 01:20.314
Oh, you didn't have to do that,
but I'm really glad
that you did.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.349
I'll put this away.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.617
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.188
-That says "Winn."

01:28.356 --> 01:30.191
-Of course.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.326
Come on!
What's wrong?

01:32.360 --> 01:35.263
I have to go on a trip
and Mrs. Queller just canceled.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.430
-Yeah.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.133
Sorry, guys, carry on.
I'm gonna just deal with this.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.336
Well, I'm...
I mean, I'm not doing anything.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.138
So I'm happy
to have Ruby here with me.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.207
No, I couldn't ask you.
Look at your leg.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.209
Come on, Mom.
Let me stay with Alex.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.278
At the Christmas party,
she promised to teach me

01:50.311 --> 01:52.346
how to punch
without breaking my thumb.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.615
Full disclosure.
I'm not a good babysitter.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.783
Yeah, you should listen to her

01:55.816 --> 01:57.685
'cause one time
she made me watch The Shining

01:57.718 --> 01:59.753
and I had nightmares for weeks.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.922
-Um, okay, she was 15--

02:01.955 --> 02:04.492
So, you were the one
who wanted to watch it!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.761
Are you sure it's okay?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.363
Yes, absolutely.

02:09.397 --> 02:12.166
I'm going a little bit
stir-crazy. So, yeah.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.835
And if she gets out of line,
I will call for backup.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.504
-You're a life saver.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.805
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Oh.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.441
That is work, for me.
I gotta go.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.911
Have fun.
Thanks.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.913
I'm totally gonna
put on The Shining.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.985
You have news about Reign?

02:32.019 --> 02:35.523
Coville told you
he met a dying priestess
who escaped from Fort Rozz.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.924
She told him
everything about Reign.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.792
Well, we combed
the manifests of Fort Rozz

02:38.826 --> 02:41.329
and found there are exactly
two priestesses on board.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.563
One being...

02:43.831 --> 02:46.667
Jindah Kol Rozz.
Fort Rozz was named after her.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.868
Yep, and on the manifest,

02:47.901 --> 02:49.937
she actually has
the exact same glyph

02:49.970 --> 02:51.104
-as Reign.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.207
We believe that
in all the time Fort Rozz

02:53.241 --> 02:54.675
was marooned here
on earth, she never got out.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.544
Uh, there's a small problem.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.946
I kind of threw
Fort Rozz into space, remember?

02:58.979 --> 03:00.281
That's what we thought.

03:00.314 --> 03:05.686
But, then we found it, orbiting
a little star called AZ336XB12.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.656
Did you say "AZ336XB12"?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.291
Problem?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.293
Yeah, that's a blue star.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.562
I won't have my powers there.
There's no yellow sun.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.997
Blue stars
also emit omicron radiation

03:17.030 --> 03:20.601
which means it's fatal
for any life-form
with a Y chromosome.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.703
It's poisonous to men?

03:22.736 --> 03:25.306
Well, I guess
I have to go alone.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.374
Absolutely not.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.576
I will not allow you
to go up there by yourself.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.910
Not without your powers.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.445
Me neither. I'll go with you.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.582
No, I would not ask you
to do that.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.617
You're not asking, I'm offering.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.988
Kara, we fought
some tough escapees on earth.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.591
What's left on that fort
are the worst of the worst.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.726
You two can't handle this
on your own.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.761
Yeah, maybe you're right.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.664
Maybe we will need some help.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.474
Can I get a warm

04:00.508 --> 04:01.975
Uh, my toast is wet.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.011
You ready yet?

04:04.044 --> 04:04.945
Yeah, I have a question.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.315
Do you have
a gluten

04:09.783 --> 04:11.819
It's called,
"Eat somewhere else."

04:11.852 --> 04:12.853
I'm gonna go on break.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.055
And when I get back,
you better order something

04:15.088 --> 04:17.325
that doesn't make me
wanna punch you in the face.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.664
What, are you drinking
on the job, Livewire?

04:23.697 --> 04:24.998
Or should I say, "Roseanne"?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.839
How'd you find me?

04:31.872 --> 04:34.908
I've been keeping tabs on you
ever since I let you go.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.976
Yeah, well...

04:36.009 --> 04:38.646
As you can see,
I'm making an honest living now.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.648
So if you're looking
to go a few rounds,

04:40.681 --> 04:42.850
come back after
the breakfast rush.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.285
No, I'm not here
to fight you, I'm...

04:47.688 --> 04:49.790
I'm here because
I need your help.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.792
My help?

04:51.825 --> 04:54.695
-I loathe you!
-I know why you're working here.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.731
It's because of Reign.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.804
She's been killing criminals
so you decided to go straight.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.073
-Smart.
-Yeah, well,
some of those criminals

05:06.106 --> 05:07.641
were people I knew.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.610
Friends of mine.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.944
And they didn't deserve to die.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.413
No, they didn't.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.948
So help me get Reign.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.585
I saw you get body-slammed

05:17.618 --> 05:19.553
by that GLOW reject
on Christmas.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.821
It was all over the news.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.690
You think I'm up
for a beatdown like that

05:22.723 --> 05:24.425
just because you said,
"Pretty please"?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.560
Honey, you haven't been reading
my psych evals correctly.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.429
I'm not asking you to fight her.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.864
I'm asking you to help me
get intel on her.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.635
Which requires us
to go to a place

05:34.668 --> 05:36.770
where I won't have my powers.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.476
So I need someone I know to...

05:43.877 --> 05:45.012
to have my back.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.490
-Oh, my God!

05:58.158 --> 06:00.594
Look, she's gonna
come after you sooner or later,

06:00.628 --> 06:02.029
so are you gonna help me or not?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.139
And this is where
the magic happens, my friend.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.008
From here, we can monitor
and communicate with
the Legi Cruiser

06:15.042 --> 06:17.511
any time throughout
their entire mission.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.481
Incredible.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.884
You actually rely on this
to keep people safe?

06:23.917 --> 06:27.788
This is the technology
that backs up Supergirl

06:27.821 --> 06:29.757
when she goes into battle?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.059
It is...

06:32.092 --> 06:32.960
Yes.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.530
She is so much braver
than I ever knew.

06:36.564 --> 06:42.035
I've seen espresso machines
with more processing power.

06:42.069 --> 06:46.640
Uh, FYI, not everyone here
is on board with
you coming along.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.941
-Screw 'em.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.446
Cosplay! I remember you.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.647
You tried to save my life.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.182
Yeah, I remember succeeding.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.784
Hey, Leslie,
you remember me?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.952
I used to fix your computer
at CatCo.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.855
No.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.457
Prisoner arrived.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.794
Thanks for agreeing to join us.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.530
Reign's going after people
like me.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.064
I don't wanna get killed
by that psycho

07:11.098 --> 07:12.966
when I finally break out
of this place.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.971
-Ninety-nine, but you ain't one.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.039
Supergirl?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.946
Livewire, I get.
You two have a history.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.681
-But Psi--
-I know, I know.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.116
But you know
how powerful she is.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.984
I mean, she beat you
in a psychic duel.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.820
She overpowered me
more than once.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.087
That's exactly
what I'm worried about.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.824
I am a little worried too,
to be honest.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.959
But If we're gonna win
this thing,
we have to take risks,

07:38.992 --> 07:41.094
and this feels like
a risk worth taking.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.096
All right.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.965
This should
unlock the psychic dampener.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.967
All right.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.969
The ship's ready.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.605
Remember the light drive
can get a little finicky.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.240
-I know.
-And if there's a breach, just--

07:53.273 --> 07:54.708
Mon-El.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.109
I've captained the ship
more times than you.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.278
Just take care of each other.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.613
We will.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.848
Good luck.

08:00.881 --> 08:01.949
Let's move.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.680
Do we have any idea
where she could be?

08:32.713 --> 08:35.115
No. Her records didn't say
where she was held.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.017
We'll just have
to search, I guess.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.153
Fort Rozz, that was where
your real mother--

08:40.187 --> 08:42.289
Locked up criminals? Yeah.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.727
Let's just say no one there
will be welcoming my arrival.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.563
Well, um, good thing
we've got the dream team then.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.864
-Nice tiara.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.934
Why don't you zap it off me
and I'll show you what I can do.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.336
It would be such
a delicious pleasure

08:56.369 --> 08:59.740
to bring you to your knees
and watch you writhe in pain.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.843
Do you always talk like that?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.145
At least I don't sound
like an illiterate mean girl.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.814
Okay, Regina George.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.649
Hey, let's tone it
down here, okay?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.183
We're all here
for the same reason, right?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.153
I'll take that as a yes.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.122
How much longer
is this gonna be?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.758
Do we have to get plugged into
some kind of space beds

09:17.791 --> 09:19.660
so we can sleep
until we get there or something?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.595
Actually, we're approaching now.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.230
For real?

09:24.932 --> 09:26.333
It's a fast ship.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.135
So that's your
Kryptonian Alcatraz?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.208
They're gonna try
and steamroll you, okay?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.877
They always do.
But just remind them

09:36.910 --> 09:38.345
without L-Corp,
their business is moot.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.814
Trust me, they'll be reminded.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.215
Thanks for doing this.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.817
I know it must be hard
to leave Ruby.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.886
You know what, I have a feeling
she will be fine

09:45.919 --> 09:47.254
without me this time around.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.624
I'll see you when you get back.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.301
Rishda seah brynya...

10:05.272 --> 10:06.840
Okay.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.743
"When East Pakistan
separated from West Pakistan,

10:09.777 --> 10:11.144
it formed which country?"

10:11.178 --> 10:12.846
Bangladesh. Pie.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.948
-I'm super smart.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.885
Whatever.
I'm super hungry, so...

10:17.918 --> 10:20.721
Where is that tater-tot
masterpiece you made me?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.389
-Your leg. I can get it.
-No, no, no. I got it.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.992
-Yes, please.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.660
Okay.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.862
You're like the toughest person
I've ever met.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.431
Well, that is the nicest thing
anybody has ever said to me.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.735
You've got a text.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.336
-Maggie.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.374
Uh...

10:41.408 --> 10:43.711
-I'll heat it up.
-Thanks.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.184
Well, according to the reading,
we should be securely locked on.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.220
Brainy, can you confirm?

10:53.253 --> 10:54.454
Affirmative.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.823
Shall we?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.369
Oh...

11:10.771 --> 11:11.939
Boo.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.206
Let's go.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.409
Is everyone okay?

11:16.443 --> 11:17.911
She's looking a little green.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.713
Brainy, what was that?

11:19.747 --> 11:21.048
The docking of the Legion ship

11:21.081 --> 11:26.153
has slightly altered
the orbital path
of Fort Rozz by .003 AUs.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.822
Not to worry,
just a bit of turbulence.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.791
"Turbulence."

11:30.824 --> 11:33.160
Uh, turbulence is the result
of chaotic changes--

11:33.193 --> 11:34.227
I know what turbulence is!

11:34.261 --> 11:36.163
All right, boys,
this is riveting,

11:36.196 --> 11:37.965
but we have a prisoner to find.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.447
Promising start.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.303
Space is creepy as--

12:16.336 --> 12:17.504
Guys.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.307
Holy hell.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.012
I've seen worse.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.347
He must have been poisoned
by the blue star.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.816
The lesser sex.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.921
I'm pretty sure
that's not how jail cells work.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.326
Fort Rozz has been floating
with limited power for so long

12:39.359 --> 12:40.327
the cells must have opened.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.229
Our scans are
picking up signatures

12:42.262 --> 12:43.831
of various life forms
loose on the ship.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.332
Kara, please be careful.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.910
Why were you delayed?

12:56.944 --> 12:59.412
It's her. I can feel her.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.349
-The human side of me.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.985
She has strength
I did not expect.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.320
She is no excuse for failure.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.889
You're right.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.590
I must focus
and find the others.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.159
You have another mission first.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.427
The fortress has detected
a signal.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.430
Supergirl and your other enemies
have boarded Fort Rozz.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.999
What for?

13:19.032 --> 13:22.035
For more information about you,
I presume.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.838
The Dark Priestess
Jindah Kol Rozz

13:24.872 --> 13:26.539
has been imprisoned
in Fort Rozz

13:26.573 --> 13:29.076
well before
the destruction of Krypton.

13:31.211 --> 13:35.182
She knows the entire extent
of our mission.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.618
She knows of your friends,
the other Worldkillers.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.855
If Supergirl gets to her
to get any information--

13:41.889 --> 13:44.057
It'll thwart our plans.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.259
You need to get to her
before Supergirl does.

13:58.906 --> 14:02.275
This place is like
the Mall of America.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.412
You can wander around her
for days and not find a thing.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.347
Do you smell that?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.381
What?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.618
Another dead body
of an incompetent male, perhaps?

14:11.651 --> 14:12.852
I smell it.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.457
You!

14:17.490 --> 14:20.293
You bear the sign
of the House of El.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.196
How dare you show
your face around here

14:37.010 --> 14:38.011
Are you hurt?

14:42.582 --> 14:43.650
Imra!

14:55.128 --> 14:56.129
Imra?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.931
Imra.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.332
You're okay. You're okay.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.201
It's gonna be okay.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.070
Why did you do that to her?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.111
Your turn.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.547
Alex?

15:14.581 --> 15:15.615
Oh.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.984
You okay?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.385
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.621
Maggie?

15:22.455 --> 15:24.424
From the text before?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.426
She's your girlfriend, right?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.195
Fiance... Ex...

15:29.496 --> 15:31.064
Ex-fiance.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.433
I...

15:33.466 --> 15:35.135
I wasn't expecting to hear
from her.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.569
It's been a while
since we broke up.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.637
Does she wanna see you?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.075
No.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.478
She thinks that she left
her passport here, I guess,

15:45.512 --> 15:50.583
and was asking if I could
please mail it to her.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.156
Do you know where it is?

15:56.189 --> 15:59.159
Honestly, the only place
I can think of is maybe

15:59.192 --> 16:00.360
in that top drawer.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.503
Here it is.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.108
Wow. She traveled a lot.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.245
Yeah.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.080
We had a lot of plans.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.088
You know...

16:29.456 --> 16:32.425
I really thought I was...
I was moving on.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.527
But,

16:35.562 --> 16:37.464
I still feel so sad.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.073
It's like, uh...

16:47.240 --> 16:48.475
This is my life now.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.678
And I can't do anything
about it.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.714
I know what you mean.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.049
Oh, yeah?

16:57.184 --> 16:59.286
There's this girl at my school.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.321
Erika Morrison.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.689
And...

17:02.722 --> 17:05.092
I didn't let her
copy my homework

17:05.125 --> 17:07.127
and she got upset

17:07.160 --> 17:09.529
and started texting
and posting things about me.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.432
Can you show me?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.201
Yeah.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.808
"Erika Morrison."
What does she know?

17:24.144 --> 17:25.778
Who died and made
this girl queen?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.082
Uh-uh.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.850
No.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.085
Come on.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.787
-Oh, this, we can do
something about.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.426
Is that really necessary?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.760
Look, either we can't trust you,

17:40.793 --> 17:42.395
or you lost control
of your powers.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.464
Bottom line, you're unsafe.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.606
So you dragged me all the way
up to space for nothing.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.642
Maybe you shouldn't have been
so loosey-goosey

17:55.675 --> 17:58.211
with your powers
on poor Matilda over there.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.286
-Yeah.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.288
I know what it feels like
when she gets in your head.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.789
If you need a minute or two...

18:09.822 --> 18:11.258
I'm fine.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.526
It was an accident!
Didn't look
that way to me.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.195
Do you wanna try this thing on,

18:15.228 --> 18:17.230
see what it feels like
to have your powers taken away?

18:17.264 --> 18:18.731
Get that thing near me
and I'm gonna fry you.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.202
Hey! No one's getting fried,
no one's getting hurt.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.536
We have a job to do.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.445
We're looking for
Jindah Kol Rozz.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.746
She has information we need.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.316
You're a bunch of fools.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.550
She's not wrong.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.685
Xitheria.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.420
-The last one

18:40.453 --> 18:42.489
who ever went to try
and find Jindah.

18:42.522 --> 18:47.394
Xitheria was a brutal criminal,
but she had softened.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.596
She wanted Jindah to join us.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.833
We never did see her again,

18:53.866 --> 18:56.403
but we heard her screams.

18:57.804 --> 19:02.242
You wanna risk your life,
you be my guest.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.178
Jindah is in
the Dendara Corridor.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.846
Beyond the dark fog.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.216
Good luck.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.655
Imra, we have had
a small emergency here.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.190
Brainy, are you there?

19:17.224 --> 19:19.459
A solar flare
has critically--

19:19.492 --> 19:20.660
Did we lose him?

19:20.693 --> 19:21.861
Lovely.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.897
Communication with the DEO
was reliant on our orbital path.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.966
What did he say
about a solar flare?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.836
You have got to be kidding me!

19:29.869 --> 19:31.971
Fort Rozz has been hit
by a solar flare.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.441
It's been knocked out of orbit,
and it's pulling us with it.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.509
"Pulling us"

19:36.543 --> 19:37.877
We're falling into the star.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.522
Vessel temperature rising.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.624
- Twenty degrees
to critical overheating
I hate space.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.992
We need to get out of here.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.927
Detach from
this monstrosity of a prison,

19:54.961 --> 19:55.995
and let's go back to Earth.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.597
The docking port's jammed.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.500
So how long before
we meet our fiery maker?

20:00.533 --> 20:01.734
One hour, maybe two.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.570
So we have time.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.305
We still have a job to do.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.739
So let's find Jindah.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.009
Imra, you stay here
and re-establish communications
with the DEO.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.279
-Psi will stay with you.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.314
Too much could go wrong
if you lose control

20:14.347 --> 20:16.683
of your powers out there
so find a way to be useful here.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.519
And if anyone attacks the ship,
cut her loose.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.587
Copy that.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.988
Leslie, let's go.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.656
I really hate
when you call me that.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.325
So all communications are down?

20:25.358 --> 20:26.926
Do you have
impulse satellites here?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.928
No. I mean, none that
are gonna reach that ship.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.531
Perfect. Just perfect.
That's great.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.433
I'll go down in history
as the 12th-level intellect

20:33.466 --> 20:35.968
who let Supergirl burn up
in a blue star.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.236
Give me my space.
I need to think.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.472
Listen. Listen to me.
What if we just try
and reroute--

20:39.506 --> 20:40.573
No! Space!

20:44.944 --> 20:48.581
When he gets like that,
it's best to just let him
do his thing.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.486
We should be close
to the Dendara Corridor

20:53.520 --> 20:54.654
according to the directions.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.324
Glad one of us was listening.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.859
So, what's the deal with
that beautiful girl?

20:59.892 --> 21:02.362
I mean, does everyone
in the future look like that?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.464
She's...

21:04.497 --> 21:07.300
She's my ex-boyfriend's wife.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.438
Snap.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.040
Wait, Cosplay's
your ex

21:14.073 --> 21:17.043
Well, that's some
Real Housewives drama
right there.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.412
So, do you hate her
with every fiber of your being?

21:19.446 --> 21:21.781
It's not her fault.
It's nobody's fault.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.656
So, are we sure

21:29.689 --> 21:31.658
the Real Housewife's
gonna be able to figure out--

21:31.691 --> 21:33.793
-Just focus
on the mission, okay?
-Fine.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.696
So, this Reign character.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.598
We're getting information
so we can kill her?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.600
No. Of course not.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.602
Priestess will have information
that I could use

21:42.635 --> 21:43.803
to get through to her.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.672
What?

21:45.705 --> 21:48.608
Come on.
You and your Pollyanna BS.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.643
You think you're gonna
get through to Reign?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.512
I got through to you.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.615
There must be something good
in you that I could trust
to come with me.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.084
I came with you because
there is a maniac on the loose

21:58.117 --> 21:59.586
and I wanna take her down.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.388
If you think I wouldn't fry you
right now--

22:01.421 --> 22:02.422
So, do it.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.804
All I'm saying
is somebody as evil

22:17.837 --> 22:19.372
as Reign deserves to die.

22:19.406 --> 22:22.008
And anyone else who thinks
otherwise is just a sucker?

22:22.041 --> 22:23.710
Now you're catching on.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.015
There's the fog.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.583
Looks like we're here.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.931
Is it colder in here?

23:01.681 --> 23:02.749
Supergirl?

23:30.209 --> 23:31.778
Supergirl!

23:36.248 --> 23:38.551
Supergirl?

23:39.686 --> 23:41.420
Kara Zor-El.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.157
Kara Zor-El.

23:48.828 --> 23:49.829
Livewire?

23:55.067 --> 23:56.636
Leslie?

23:56.669 --> 23:58.571
Kara Zor-El.

24:04.744 --> 24:05.912
Are you Erika Morrison?

24:05.945 --> 24:07.614
Yeah.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.682
Special Agent Danvers, FBI.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.217
Have you been sending
harassing messages

24:11.250 --> 24:12.852
to a young woman
named Ruby Arias?

24:12.885 --> 24:14.687
No, I haven't.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.122
We intercepted this
earlier today.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.691
Did you know
the FBI monitors cyberbullying?

24:18.725 --> 24:21.961
I have 23 separate incidents
of harassment catalogued here.

24:21.994 --> 24:22.795
But I didn't mean it.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.197
You violated
three criminal statutes.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.633
Do you know what that means?

24:26.666 --> 24:29.235
-That means you could
go to juvie.
-I don't want to go to juvie!

24:29.268 --> 24:30.369
Well, you should've
thought about that

24:30.402 --> 24:33.005
-before you broke the law.
-I'll never do it again.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.841
-I promise.
I don't know.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.076
I think I should probably
still talk to your parents
about this.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.178
No, please don't tell my mom.
She'll kill me.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.848
Okay.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.116
You will apologize
to Miss Arias.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.953
And if I ever hear
another incident of bullying

24:46.986 --> 24:49.756
from you ever again,

24:49.789 --> 24:52.559
you will have
the federal government
to deal with.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.993
You won't. I swear.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.528
Have a nice day.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.497
Go ahead. Close the door.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.001
That was awesome.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.135
Right? Give me the crutches.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.772
Okay. So, there's a girl
who lives three houses down.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.874
-She shoved me in kindergarten.
-Don't push it.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.810
Nineteen minutes
until event horizon.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.078
We gotta figure this out.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.882
Maybe we can bend the signal,
like around the star somehow?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.584
With what, willpower?

25:17.617 --> 25:19.886
No. We need to boost
a strong enough signal

25:19.919 --> 25:21.621
-to go through the star.
-Yes. But--

25:21.654 --> 25:23.890
-You have
nuclear power, correct?
-Yes, we do.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.692
We could use a cold-fusion
optical transceiver

25:25.725 --> 25:27.159
to harness the...
Why're you shaking your head?

25:27.193 --> 25:29.996
We don't have cold fusion.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.298
Of course not.
Why would that be useful?

25:32.331 --> 25:35.735
We have to think inside the box
and use the technology we have.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.905
Oh. Hmm. Okay.
"The technology we have."

25:38.938 --> 25:41.908
Eureka! I've got it.
An empty bottle.

25:41.941 --> 25:46.045
We'll write the instructions
on paper and we'll launch it
into space.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.682
It will only take 12,234 years
to arrive.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.651
Message in a bottle.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.019
- Voyager.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.722
What is... What is that?
- Voyager 1 and 2.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.757
They're space probes
from the '70s.
Dude, learn your history.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.125
They carry
a record of peace

25:59.158 --> 26:00.827
from the people of Earth.
A message in a bottle.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.994
Yes, yes.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.462
Okay. We can bounce
the signal off of Voyager 2.

26:03.495 --> 26:06.799
It has a straight line of sight
directly to the Legion ship.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.167
-Yeah.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.637
Do it. Do it fast.
Good work, Agent Schott.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.805
Winn, thank you.
-You got it.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.210
Vessel temperature rising.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.379
Ten degrees
to critical overheating.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.615
Maybe you should
work faster.

26:22.649 --> 26:26.118
Maybe you should make
yourself useful and hand me
that spanner wrench.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.729
"Sing a song of sixpence,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.631
-a pocketful of rye."
-It's no good.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.767
I can't get a strong enough
signal to reach planet Earth.

26:40.800 --> 26:45.371
"Four and twenty naughty boys
baked into a pie."

26:45.404 --> 26:46.873
What are you on about?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.909
"The maid was in the garden

26:50.743 --> 26:52.745
hanging up the clothes,

26:55.815 --> 26:59.919
when lowly came a blackbird
and pecked off her nose."

27:06.025 --> 27:08.627
It's Reign. She's here.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.764
Kara Zor-El.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.740
Daughter of Alura.

27:20.773 --> 27:21.874
Jindah Kol Rozz?

27:21.908 --> 27:24.811
You know I am. And yet you ask.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.213
Uncertainty will be your doom.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.782
Not green stone.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.751
-I came to ask--
-I know why you came.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.787
The Phantom Zone
dampened my powers,

27:35.254 --> 27:36.789
not the Sight.

27:38.124 --> 27:42.094
Misery of your mother's design.
But you'll be with her soon.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.764
Can you tell me about Reign?

27:44.797 --> 27:46.866
-She will destroy you.
-I've heard otherwise.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.836
You know nothing
of the nature of destruction.

27:49.869 --> 27:53.272
You are a child living in light.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.442
But there is darkness
in all things.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.011
In every soul you know.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.147
-No one,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.215
if I have anything
to say about it.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.821
You fly too close to the sun.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.793
I have languished in pain

28:13.826 --> 28:16.395
for time beyond reason
because of you,

28:16.428 --> 28:18.330
the Children of light.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.934
But your pretty skin

28:21.968 --> 28:25.872
will soon be brittle scales
in hellfire

28:25.905 --> 28:27.473
when the others awake

28:27.506 --> 28:31.443
and unite
beneath the standard of Reign.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.345
What do you mean, "others"?

28:33.379 --> 28:35.447
Worldkillers.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.417
The power, the pestilence,

28:38.450 --> 28:40.186
the purity.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.225
Priestess.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.727
My child. You've come.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.363
At last our time is upon us.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.499
Deliver me from this prison

28:53.532 --> 28:57.003
and we will bring anguish
upon our enemies.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.347
How do you have
your powers here?

29:08.380 --> 29:11.984
My powers aren't dependent
on something as trivial
as a sun.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.523
You're different
without your powers.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.125
Like a child,

29:19.158 --> 29:20.759
helpless and afraid.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.863
I'm not afraid of you.

29:24.931 --> 29:25.832
Even though we're enemies,

29:25.865 --> 29:27.499
there's still something
that binds us.

29:27.533 --> 29:28.968
Save your speech, Supergirl.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.003
No, you have to hear me.

29:31.037 --> 29:33.405
There is something in you

29:33.439 --> 29:35.341
that sees what you're doing
is wrong,

29:35.374 --> 29:38.477
that sees the pain
you're causing and regrets it.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.880
You don't have to be my enemy.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.015
You want justice in the world,
so do I.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.251
But we're not gonna find it
by attacking each other.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.023
And that's where you're wrong.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.162
Watch out.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.164
Coming to Supergirl's rescue?

29:58.197 --> 30:00.066
I'm coming to take you down.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.472
We need to find Supergirl.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.606
What are you talking about?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.108
We need to find a way
out of here.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.576
Vessel temperature rising.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.912
Five degrees
to critical overheating.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.480
I refuse to get incinerated
by a star.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.315
I have tried everything.
I can't...

30:16.348 --> 30:19.518
Imra, we've
reestablished communication
with you from the DEO.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.287
-Brainy,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.055
I copy.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.123
-Yes!
-I told you

30:24.156 --> 30:26.025
we would figure out a solution.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.626
I can interface with Fort Rozz
from here,

30:27.659 --> 30:29.862
redirect some of our power
to its throttles.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.397
Hey, Imra,
have you found the Priestess?

30:31.430 --> 30:34.400
They're looking for her now.
But, Winn, Reign's here.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.202
What?

30:37.003 --> 30:38.204
Okay. No, no. You need...

30:38.237 --> 30:39.605
You need to go
protect Supergirl.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.507
No, she can't. She needs
to control the throttles

30:41.540 --> 30:43.609
and manually hit
these coordinates
until the ships are steadied

30:43.642 --> 30:45.411
and Fort Rozz is back
in its original orbit.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.446
Okay, well,
who is gonna handle Reign?

30:50.016 --> 30:52.484
I can go.
Take this thing off me.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.206
See?

31:15.407 --> 31:17.309
Don't be afraid, Matilda.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.429
-You're a nuisance.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.674
Get your hands off her!

31:53.579 --> 31:57.716
And you need
to stop attacking my friends.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.037
No, no. Stop! Stop.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.272
I'm the one you want, right?

32:20.306 --> 32:22.208
I'm the one who's trying
to stop you.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.210
She came here because of me.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.545
Then she can watch you
die first.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.086
-No. Leslie, no!
-Leave her.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.254
-Leslie.
Blackbird.

32:38.324 --> 32:42.561
What's going on underneath
that dark, dark shell of yours?

33:01.780 --> 33:04.983
Help! Help! Help me!

33:06.785 --> 33:08.620
Mom, help!

33:08.654 --> 33:10.522
Mom, don't let them take me!

33:21.233 --> 33:22.534
Where am I?

33:24.570 --> 33:25.771
Where am I?

33:27.739 --> 33:29.141
What's happening?

33:31.343 --> 33:32.344
Supergirl.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.679
Reign?

33:45.457 --> 33:47.726
Leslie. Leslie?

33:47.759 --> 33:48.860
Leslie.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.463
Hey, you have to stay with me.
Stay here, stay here.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.699
Come on.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.236
-No.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.373
No, no. Just stay.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.741
Livewire.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.511
Leslie.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.461
Well done.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.532
You worried?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.834
No. No, no, no. I knew
you'd be fine the whole time.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.369
Oh, yeah. He sure did.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.571
She really helped.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.277
Hey.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.681
You saved me. Thank you.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.083
Don't get emotional. I just
didn't want to die out there.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.121
Sorry about your friend though.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.296
Can we get her
a better room, please?

34:58.897 --> 35:00.799
Maybe one with a window.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.343
She really came through, huh?

35:11.943 --> 35:13.512
They both did.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.886
Okay.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.489
I can take it to the post office
if you want.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.592
Oh, that's okay.
I can manage tomorrow.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.463
It was really fun hanging out
with you today.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.600
It was, wasn't it?

35:34.633 --> 35:37.636
I don't know how I would have
handled this without you here.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.505
I mean, normally
I'd lean on my sister.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.574
But, well, she's out of town.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.910
Well, I can sub for her anytime.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.778
-Thank you.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.181
-Probably my mom.
Hey, it's Sam.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.882
Wow. Good call.
Come on in.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.620
-Hey.
-Hey, she's alive.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.555
Hi, baby. I missed you.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.756
Missed you, too.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.560
-A total disaster.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.562
I mean, what a nightmare
of a kid you've raised.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.432
-Oh, I know.
She's rough, right?

36:06.465 --> 36:08.800
Hey, I will meet you
in the elevator.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.936
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.705
-Be good. No Shining.
-See you.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.678
So, how did it go?
How was the trip?

36:20.679 --> 36:24.216
Your work trip.

36:24.250 --> 36:27.286
Wow, I mean, it must've been
really bad if you've
already blocked it out.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.187
It's okay.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.790
I said I had a work trip?

36:32.658 --> 36:33.759
Yeah.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.697
No, I did. I did. I know...

36:39.465 --> 36:40.866
I know I did.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.268
I know I said that.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.470
But I didn't go anywhere.

36:45.471 --> 36:47.839
Oh, my God. Lena called.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.276
How did I miss this?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.712
Are you okay?

36:53.745 --> 36:56.315
They had a car for me.
I never got in the car.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.683
I never got on a plane.

36:59.651 --> 37:00.686
How?

37:05.324 --> 37:06.925
Oh, my God.
Ruby said it the other day.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.660
-That I was gone.

37:08.694 --> 37:12.798
I told her that I was going
somewhere but I didn't.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.834
I don't know where I went.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.703
I thought maybe I was stressed

37:17.736 --> 37:20.005
or, you know, maybe
she was remembering wrong.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.408
But it keeps happening to me.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.776
-I keep losing time.
-Sam, just take a deep breath--

37:24.810 --> 37:27.279
No, I don't know
where I've been.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.718
Alex, I think
something's wrong with me.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.594
I hear you had
a hard go of it up there.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.664
Yeah.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.335
Yeah, as far as ghost ships go,

37:49.368 --> 37:50.936
it wasn't the scariest
I've ever been on.

37:50.969 --> 37:55.774
But it certainly wasn't
a fun house.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.076
I know my being back here
hasn't made things easy for you.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.411
-Mon-El.
-It's true.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.616
But I can see that
you're struggling
and I wanna help.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.619
-I wanna make things
better for you.
-I know you do.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.728
Well, then try me.
I'm a much better listener.

38:16.762 --> 38:19.365
-Talk to me.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.903
I promise I'm...
I'm a heck of a lot wiser than

38:24.936 --> 38:28.640
whoever that guy was
that landed here a year ago.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.710
Just try it. Try me.
I'm a much better listener.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.719
I feel badly

38:40.752 --> 38:42.388
that I couldn't get through
to Reign.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.559
I saw humanity in her.
I got a glimpse of it

38:47.593 --> 38:51.062
and I should have been able
to reach it.

38:51.096 --> 38:54.733
And maybe if I did reach it,
Leslie would still be alive.

39:00.406 --> 39:01.840
Yeah, I know the feeling.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.579
Leading people into battle
and not bringing them home.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.116
It's hard.

39:13.485 --> 39:14.486
No kidding.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.523
But for what it's worth,

39:17.556 --> 39:19.558
you might not have
gotten through to Reign.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.728
But, I mean, Livewire, she's...

39:22.761 --> 39:24.630
She was as bad as they come.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.132
And you got through to her.

39:28.934 --> 39:32.704
You... You gave her something
to fight for, to sacrifice for.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.943
You changed her heart
for the better.
That's, I mean...

39:38.910 --> 39:40.546
That's amazing.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.116
And you did that
without the yellow sun.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.618
That was all you.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.424
What?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.894
Wow, your advice
actually makes sense now.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.497
I think I'd actually follow it.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.732
-There is a logical progression.
-That sounds like...

40:00.766 --> 40:03.802
-Comes to a point at the end.

40:05.837 --> 40:09.775
And, you know, speaking
of glass-half-full stuff,

40:09.808 --> 40:12.143
that Kryptonian Priestess
gave you some information

40:12.177 --> 40:13.979
about the Worldkillers.
That's not for nothing.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.581
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.684
She called them
"Purity and Pestilence."

40:21.753 --> 40:25.857
So, now all we have to do
is find them before Reign does.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.633
How am I supposed to say no?

40:34.666 --> 40:36.001
You just say it.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.570
"No. I am not going
to waste my youth,

40:38.604 --> 40:42.608
my life, my vitality
sitting in some cubicle."

40:42.641 --> 40:44.643
I am not gonna be in a cubicle.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.545
They're giving me
an office with a view.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.680
Of what,
the parking lot?

40:48.714 --> 40:51.950
-Julia, it's time to grow up.
-You mean give up.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.096
Julia
