WEBVTT

00:00.267 --> 00:03.736
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS..

00:03.738 --> 00:05.471
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.140
HEY, IF YOU NEED
A PLACE TO STAY...

00:08.142 --> 00:10.809
THERE'S AN OLD COUCH
IN MY BASEMENT.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.511
MY MOM WILL NEVER KNOW.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.080
Paige: WAS THERE A SECOND WATCH?
WAS ANYONE ELSE KEEPING TIME?

00:15.082 --> 00:18.217
IT<i> WAS</i> A TIE, PAIGE.
YOU AND EMILY TIED.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.220
YOU NEED TO BE HOME
WHERE YOU'RE SAFE.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.689
YOU COULD CHAIN ME
TO THIS PORCH

00:23.691 --> 00:27.092
AND I'D STILL NEVER
TOUCH YOU LIKE THAT AGAIN.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.395
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH
MRS. POTTER'S HOUSEKEEPER.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.164
MRS. POTTER HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.332
PAIGE?

00:33.334 --> 00:35.334
I'M SORRY, EMILY.

00:35.336 --> 00:38.203
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.373
I THINK MAYBE
YOU'RE BEING FRAMED.
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.743
I THINK SOMEBODY MIGHT BE TRYING
TO DO THE SAME THING TO ME.

00:44.745 --> 00:48.747
SO, THIS IS WHAT A REAL DATE
WITH EZRA FITZ LOOKS LIKE.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.749
LEAD THE WAY.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.118
Hanna: I GAVE YOUR MOM
THE MUSEUM TICKET.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.220
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
"A" HAS SOMETHING ON ME.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.057
"A" HAS SOMETHING
ON<i> ALL</i> OF US, HANNA.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.395
Hanna:
YOUR SISTER'S PREGNANT.
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.364
I FIGURE PRETTY MUCH
THE USUAL WAY.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.965
IT'S NOT REALLY
A "HOW" QUESTION,

01:06.967 --> 01:09.735
IT'S MORE OF
A "WHY" QUESTION.

01:09.737 --> 01:13.572
WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS
MELISSA COULD HAVE GONE
ALL MATERNAL,

01:13.574 --> 01:14.706
BUT I DOUBT IT.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.508
THIS IS<i> SO</i> CREEPY.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.143
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

01:18.145 --> 01:20.512
PHILADELPHIA. SHOPPING.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.847
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS MEANS?

01:21.849 --> 01:25.617
I DON'T KNOW, BUT TOBY
WANTED US TO HAVE IT.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.619
THERE.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.621
IT'S IN BRAILLE,
SO...

01:31.725 --> 01:34.760
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS, ARIA?
NO.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.428
I CAN SEE JUST FINE
FROM HERE.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.667
OKAY.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.238
THE FIRST LETTER'S A "B."

01:52.580 --> 01:55.214
"A." IT'S AN "A."

01:55.216 --> 01:57.182
I THINK IT'S GONNA
TELL US WHO "A" IS.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.589
"D."

02:03.591 --> 02:06.925
B-A-D.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.360
"BAD."

02:10.030 --> 02:11.797
THAT'S THE WHOLE MESSAGE?
"BAD?"

02:11.799 --> 02:13.799
WHAT'S IT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

02:13.801 --> 02:15.534
Aria: IT MEANS
YOU GOT PUNKED.

02:15.536 --> 02:19.037
TOBY DOESN'T TRUST US.
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.640
NO, I DON'T THINK
HE'D MESS WITH US
LIKE THIS.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.009
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.512
YOU GUYS, WE HAVE
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.714
THIS MIGHT BE A JOKE,
BUT IT COULD BE SOMETHING REAL.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.516
LOOK, EITHER WAY,
TOBY'S NOT THE ENEMY.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.853
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?
I'M GONNA GO.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.157
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.058
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

02:49.003 --> 02:51.303
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT ¶</i>

02:51.305 --> 02:53.839
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

02:53.841 --> 02:56.341
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

02:56.343 --> 02:59.011
<i> ¶ TAKIN' THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

02:59.013 --> 03:01.346
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THAT I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

03:01.348 --> 03:04.016
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

03:04.018 --> 03:06.418
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO CAN</i>
<i> GET THE SECRET ¶</i>

03:06.420 --> 03:08.453
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:18.363
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
VERY MUCH.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.731
WELL,
IT'S ALL WE HAVE.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.700
THE REST IS GONE.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.236
YOU KNOW, MOM, MRS. POTTER
DOESN'T NEED THAT MONEY ANYMORE.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.538
NO, BUT WE CAN'T KEEP IT.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.040
NO, NOT KEEP IT,

03:28.042 --> 03:30.008
BUT I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE WE COULD

03:30.010 --> 03:31.276
GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY
WHO NEEDS IT.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.880
I LOVE YOU FOR THINKING THAT,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.882
BUT I JUST WANT
THIS NIGHTMARE TO BE OVER.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.585
I'M PUTTING THE MONEY
BACK IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX,

03:39.587 --> 03:41.220
WHAT IS LEFT OF IT.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.955
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

03:42.957 --> 03:43.956
BYE, MOM.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.467
I LEFT A WAKEUP CALL
FOR NINE.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.703
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?

03:57.705 --> 04:01.440
YOU MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
BASEMENT BREAKFAST PLACES?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.376
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.311
WELL, IT WON'T BE LONG.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.348
YOU'D GO BACK TO
YOUR FOSTER PARENTS?

04:09.350 --> 04:11.383
NOT A CHANCE.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.919
BUT I'VE ALMOST SAVED UP ENOUGH
TO GET OUT TO ARIZONA.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.488
I HAVE A FRIEND
IN FLAGSTAFF.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.757
YOU GONNA MISS ME?

04:18.759 --> 04:22.261
WELL, IT WAS NICE KNOWING
WHEN SOMETHING GOES BUMP
IN THE NIGHT, IT'S YOU.

04:22.263 --> 04:25.330
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO BE AFRAID OF?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.766
( door opens )

04:27.768 --> 04:29.001
( door closes )

04:36.777 --> 04:38.477
FORGOT THIS.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.446
HONEY? PUT ON GLOVES
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THE DISHES.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.181
( exhales ) RIGHT.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.460
( chatter )

05:09.943 --> 05:11.376
HEY.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.011
HEY.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.480
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.650
LAST NIGHT AFTER I LEFT
I FELT<i> AWFUL.</i>

05:18.652 --> 05:23.121
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID
AND--AND WHAT ALMOST HAPPENED.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.790
I SHOULD HAVE
FIGURED IT OUT.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.958
AT LEAST I SHOULD
HAVE LISTENED TO YOU.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.761
YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS TERRIBLE, BUT...

05:29.763 --> 05:31.363
ALL I COULD
THINK ABOUT WAS MY MOM.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.668
I'M SORRY.
I WAS<i> SO</i> MEAN.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.970
WELL, I HAD IT COMING.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.505
NO.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.007
I WAS THINKING--

05:42.009 --> 05:43.842
"A" COULD HAVE GIVEN
THAT TICKET TO MY MOM,

05:43.844 --> 05:46.478
BUT THEY MADE YOU DO IT
JUST TO MAKE IT HURT MORE.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.681
I WANT TO SAY THAT
IT'S ALL "A's" FAULT,

05:49.683 --> 05:53.852
BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO GAVE YOUR MOM
THAT TICKET...

05:53.854 --> 05:56.421
AND I DON'T LIKE KNOWING
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.224
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.
OKAY? THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

06:03.197 --> 06:08.300
IT WAS A SILENT AUCTION,
AND A PRIVATE BOOK SIGNING
AND COFFEE WITH THE AUTHOR.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.901
I REALLY LIKED
HIS EARLY WORK,

06:09.903 --> 06:11.703
THAT BOOK ABOUT
THE TEACHER IN NEWARK.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.539
SO, DO YOU WANT COFFEE
WITH LEONARD ADAMS

06:14.541 --> 06:17.042
AND AN AUTOGRAPHED BOOK?
COUNT ME<i> IN.</i>

06:17.044 --> 06:20.412
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THE NEWARK BOOK?
<i> LOOSE LEAF.</i>

06:20.414 --> 06:21.880
THAT WAS GOOD, WASN'T IT?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.216
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US, ELLA?

06:24.218 --> 06:25.884
HOW MANY PEOPLE
CAN YOU BRING?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.886
AS--AS MANY AS I WANT.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.354
WELL, COME WITH US, ELLA.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.123
ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.495
YOU KNOW, ARIA MIGHT
BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.364
TOBY DOES HAVE EVERY REASON
TO GIVE US A HARD TIME.

06:39.366 --> 06:44.035
I SUPPOSE, BUT THAT'S JUST
NOT THE FEELING THAT I GOT
FROM TALKING TO HIM.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.338
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YEAH, I DO.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.839
HEY.
HEY.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.709
WHAT IS WITH YOU
AND THE ARTFUL DODGER?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.444
WHO?
CALEB.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.880
I THOUGHT THAT THING
AT THE SWIM MEET
WAS A ONE-OFF.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.783
IT WAS.
WE JUST SAW YOU
TALKING TO HIM.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.918
AND YOU GAVE HIM SOMETHING
THAT LOOKED LIKE
A WET OVEN MITT.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.587
IT WAS HIS HAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH HIS HAT?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.790
WHY SHOULDN'T I
HAVE HIS HAT?

07:04.792 --> 07:10.562
HANNA, MAYBE YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE EDGIER AFTER SEAN,

07:10.564 --> 07:14.065
BUT THIS GUY IS DARK.
SPENCER,
HE'S NOT THAT DARK.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.936
HE'S DARK<i> ENOUGH.</i>
WELL, HE'S NO ARTHUR DODGER,
WHOEVER THAT IS.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.871
YEAH, HE'S JUST...
HAD IT TOUGH.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.874
ARE YOU TWO ON
SPEAKING TERMS AGAIN?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.477
'COURSE WE ARE.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.479
YOU NEED TO BE
REALLY CAREFUL
ABOUT THAT GUY.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.415
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME
WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION
ONCE ABOUT TOBY.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.428
I'M LOOKING FOR
COACH FULTON.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.230
IS THE COACH
EXPECTING YOU?

07:45.232 --> 07:47.666
THE COACH IS AVOIDING ME.
THAT'S WHAT THE COACH IS DOING.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.334
ARE YOU A PARENT?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.570
YES, I'M A PARENT.
NICK McCULLERS.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.071
MY DAUGHTER
IS PAIGE McCULLERS.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.906
I HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER
IN ENGLISH COMP.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.475
I'M EZRA FITZ.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.143
THE<i> COACH.</i>

07:58.145 --> 08:00.045
WHY DON'T WE WALK DOWN
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

08:00.047 --> 08:02.681
AND SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND
COACH FULTON?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.349
I'VE SEEN THE PRINCIPAL,
AND ALL I GOT

08:04.351 --> 08:06.651
WAS A LOT OF
POLITICALLY CORRECT
DOUBLE-TALK

08:06.653 --> 08:08.987
ABOUT THE AGENDA IN THIS PLACE
THAT'S PENALIZING MY DAUGHTER,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.755
TAKING OPPORTUNITIES
AWAY FROM HER

08:10.757 --> 08:12.691
AND GIVING THEM TO SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T DESERVE THEM!

08:12.693 --> 08:15.327
EVERYBODY GETS
A FAIR CHANCE HERE,
MR. McCULLERS.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.295
WE GO OUT OF OUR WAY
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

08:17.297 --> 08:20.131
MY GIRL IS
THE BEST SWIMMER
ON THAT TEAM,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.133
AND YOU CAN'T<i> GIVE</i> IT
TO SOMEBODY JUST BECAUSE--

08:22.135 --> 08:24.503
YOU'RE IN A CAFETERIA,
MR. McCULLERS,

08:24.505 --> 08:26.638
FILLED WITH KIDS
TRYING TO HAVE LUNCH.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.608
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE AUDIENCE YOU WANT, IS IT?

08:56.136 --> 08:59.170
HELLO, MRS. MARIN.
I'M JAMES LELAND.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.573
HAVE A SEAT, MR. LELAND.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.876
I'M SORRY, MY REGULAR ASSISTANT
DIDN'T MAKE YOUR APPOINTMENT--

09:04.878 --> 09:07.412
ALL I KNOW IS, YOU NEED
TO SPEAK TO AN OFFICER.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.881
I'M ESTHER POTTER'S NEPHEW.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.050
SHE DIED RECENTLY.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.253
YES, I'M SORRY.
SHE WAS A LOYAL CUSTOMER.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.956
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT HER ACCOUNTS,
HER SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.693
UM...ACTUALLY,

09:21.695 --> 09:23.328
WE WERE UNDER
THE IMPRESSION

09:23.330 --> 09:25.564
MRS. POTTER HAD
NO LIVING RELATIVES.

09:25.566 --> 09:29.067
SHE CERTAINLY WAS
THE LAST OF THE POTTERS.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.337
BUT HER SISTER
MARRIED MY GRANDFATHER

09:32.339 --> 09:34.973
UP IN SYRACUSE,
THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.842
I THINK TECHNICALLY
THAT MAKES ME A GREAT-NEPHEW.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.711
YES.

09:39.713 --> 09:43.381
WELL, THE STATE REVENUE AGENCY
WILL NEED TO SEE YOUR I.D.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.016
BEFORE I CAN RELEASE
ANY INFORMATION

09:45.018 --> 09:47.385
OR GIVE YOU ACCESS
TO THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.788
I THOUGHT SO.
YEAH.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.389
I BROUGHT COPIES.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.358
OH...GOOD.

09:55.529 --> 09:56.962
LELAND & DALEY?

09:56.964 --> 09:58.797
YES,
WE'RE ARCHITECTS.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.900
I WILL GET THESE
TO THE REVENUE AGENCY.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.936
IT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY
TO EXPECT A RESPONSE.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.938
I HAVE BUSINESS
IN THE AREA.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.873
I'M HERE FOR
A FEW DAYS.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.911
MY CELL NUMBER'S
ON THERE.

10:12.913 --> 10:13.745
OF COURSE.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.718
WERE YOU AND YOUR AUNT...
CLOSE?

10:19.720 --> 10:24.189
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE
SHE WAS A BIRTHDAY CARD
WITH A $5 BILL IN IT.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.124
BUT SHE NEVER
MISSED A BIRTHDAY.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.961
I UNDERSTAND.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.398
HOW ABOUT YOU? HOW WELL
DID YOU KNOW MY AUNT?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.666
MY GREAT-AUNT.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.636
OH.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.738
SHE CAME IN ONCE A YEAR.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.873
LIKE SANTA CLAUS.
HUH.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.476
SHE WAS VERY SWEET.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.044
WHEN I CALLED,
THEY TOLD ME

10:46.046 --> 10:48.680
THAT YOU HAD SPOKEN TO HER
JUST BEFORE SHE DIED.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.516
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF HER.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.551
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I COULD TELL YOU.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.955
WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT
OVER DRINKS.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.990
I DON'T KNOW.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.127
CONSIDER IT.
YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBER.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.463
I WILL GET THESE
TO THE REVENUE OFFICE.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.364
THANK YOU.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.314
LISTEN, I DIDN'T KNOW
MY DAD WAS COMING.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.450
HE WANTED TO KNOW
HOW SOMEBODY COULD BEAT ME.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.252
HE WANTED TO KNOW
IF I SLACKED OFF,
BUT I DIDN'T.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.720
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.121
I TOLD HIM WE TIED
BUT YOU GOT THE SLOT.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.057
BECAUSE I'M GAY?
NO.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.559
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
HE MUST HAVE ASKED AROUND.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.428
BUT I DIDN'T TELL HIM.
I SWEAR.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.229
I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.433
SO YOU CAN'T MAKE IT

11:41.435 --> 11:43.268
TO<i> ANY</i> OF THE TEACHER
CONFERENCES?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.270
I CAN DO THEM, I JUST NEED TO
RESCHEDULE THEM FOR TOMORROW.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.905
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE
ALL OF THEM.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.541
YOU SHOULD MEET
HER FRENCH TEACHER,
MR. CARINCI, AND--

11:49.543 --> 11:52.177
OH, ARE YOU
GOING TO MEET EZRA?
EZRA?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.012
EZRA FITZ,
HER ENGLISH TEACHER.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.414
ARIA'S CRAZY ABOUT HIM,
AND I CAN SEE WHY.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.517
HE'S VERY SMART,
HE'S ATTRACTIVE,
SENSITIVE.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.286
DOES HE ALSO
PLAY GUITAR?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.821
UH, NOT THAT I KNOW OF,

12:02.823 --> 12:05.023
BUT HE DOES KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE A LOOSE CANNON.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.858
TODAY NICK McCULLERS
SHOWED UP.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.993
McCULLERS.
FROM THE LIBRARY BOARD?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.362
THE SAME ONE,
WITH THE VERY SAME PARANOIA.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.964
HE WAS ABOUT TO LAUNCH
INTO THE GAY AGENDA

12:12.966 --> 12:14.332
RIGHT THERE
IN THE CAFETERIA.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.434
EZRA TOTALLY
CALMED THE WATERS,

12:16.436 --> 12:18.203
COMPLETELY DEFUSED
THE SITUATION.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.537
IT WAS SOMETHING TO SEE.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.639
HMM. WELL, I'M SORRY
I MISSED THAT.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.309
YOU SHOULD MEET HIM.
YOU'LL LIKE HIM.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.045
I'M LATE.
LISTEN, ELLA.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.548
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD JUST
PICK UP FROM WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.684
MAYBE NEXT FRIDAY?

12:32.686 --> 12:34.753
SURE.

12:34.755 --> 12:39.324
UH, I CAN'T. I'M ACTUALLY
GOING TO A BOOK SIGNING
WITH EZRA. LEONARD ADAMS.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.893
A-ADAMS? I THOUGHT
YOU HATED ADAMS.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.963
I LIKED HIS EARLY STUFF.
RAIN CHECK?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.331
YEAH, RAIN CHECK.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.909
TOBY?

12:57.911 --> 13:00.645
CAN I TALK TO YOU A SECOND?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.380
I CAN'T TALK.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.883
SOMETHING'S UP WITH THE D.A.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.218
THE LAWYER'S DRIVING ME OVER
TO MY DAD'S OFFICE.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.721
JUST TELL ME--
WAS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE A JOKE?

13:09.723 --> 13:12.223
WERE YOU JUST TRYING
TO GET BACK AT ME?
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE--

13:12.225 --> 13:13.558
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.094
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHAT I FOUND IN MY BOOK.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.029
THE BRAILLE THAT
YOU WANTED ME TO HAVE.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.898
THAT WAS NO JOKE.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.332
"BAD"?

13:21.334 --> 13:23.134
THE WHOLE MESSAGE WAS "BAD."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.236
AM I SUPPOSED TO GO BUY
AN OLD MICHAEL JACKSON ALBUM?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.806
YOU'RE READING IT WRONG.

13:30.110 --> 13:34.045
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW.
COME BACK SATURDAY
IN THE MORNING.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.214
JENNA'S OUT AT
HER FLUTE LESSON.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.414
I THINK YOU'RE TAKING
A BIG CHANCE WITH THIS GUY.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.182
I AM A VERY GOOD
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.618
<i> IS THAT WHY YOU FIXED ARIA UP</i>
<i> WITH AN OLD CON?</i>

14:13.620 --> 14:15.887
AN OLD CON WHO HAD
EVERYONE FOOLED.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.322
MAYBE CALEB IS THE SAME.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.460
IT'S...ONLY HANNA.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.696
I WASN'T ASKING YOU WHO
YOU WERE ON THE PHONE WITH.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.698
DO YOU WANT
THE LAST BIT OF COBBLER?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.900
I CAN BRING IT UP FOR YOU.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.268
NO, THANKS.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.238
OKAY.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.511
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"ONLY HANNA?"
<i> IT'S MY MOM.</i>

14:40.513 --> 14:42.680
THINGS ARE STILL
SUB-ZERO AROUND HERE.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.016
DID YOU TELL HER ABOUT
PAIGE'S DAD COMING TO SCHOOL?

14:45.018 --> 14:47.652
NO POINT.
SHE'LL SAY IT'S MY FAULT

14:47.654 --> 14:49.787
FOR CHOOSING
A DISGUSTING LIFESTYLE.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.556
PAIGE IS SUCH A KNOB.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.691
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ALL HER FAULT.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.893
<i> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?</i>

14:57.931 --> 15:00.131
WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND ARIA?

15:00.133 --> 15:02.500
IT'S NOTHING
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.868
<i> YOU WERE SNARKING</i>
<i> AT EACH OTHER</i>

15:03.870 --> 15:06.170
LIKE YOU WERE ON
A REALITY SHOW.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.006
"THE REAL TEENS
OF ROSEWOOD."

15:08.008 --> 15:11.009
OH, TELL ME ABOUT TOBY.

15:11.011 --> 15:15.179
HE SAYS WE HAVE
WHAT HE WANTED US TO HAVE.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.948
<i> IT'S THE RIGHT MESSAGE,</i>

15:16.950 --> 15:18.750
I'M JUST READING IT WRONG.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.120
HE WANTS ME TO
COME TO HIS HOUSE SATURDAY.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.988
ARE YOU GOING?

15:23.990 --> 15:25.823
<i> IF I DON'T,</i>
<i> HOW ARE WE GONNA</i>
<i> FIGURE THIS OUT?</i>

15:25.825 --> 15:30.028
I'M SHUT OUT WITH
MELISSA AND IAN.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.798
<i> ( sirens blare )</i>
WHERE ARE YOU?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.967
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M RIGHT HERE.
( sirens )

15:35.969 --> 15:39.337
<i> ANY FIRE TRUCK</i>
<i> YOU CAN HEAR AT YOUR HOUSE</i>
<i> I CAN HEAR AT MINE.</i>

15:39.339 --> 15:42.340
OH, MY GOD--
ARE YOU IN HIS APARTMENT?

15:44.544 --> 15:45.777
ARE YOU ON THE BED?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.547
NO. I'M NOT ON THE BED.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.082
<i> IS HE THERE?</i>

15:51.084 --> 15:53.318
N-NOT EXACTLY.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.053
IS HE TAKING A SHOWER?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.455
HE'S GETTING
TAKE-OUT FOR DINNER.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.524
AND THIS CALL'S BECOMING
VERY 1-900.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.994
"TO TALK TO A HOT
ENGLISH TEACHER, PRESS 3."

16:02.996 --> 16:04.929
CALL ENDING NOW.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.098
<i> TOMORROW?</i>
YEAH, TOMORROW.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.705
HEY.
HI THERE.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.576
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.510
IT'S OKAY.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.215
LOOKS LIKE
ROSE OF SHARON
HAS BEEN DISCOVERED.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.718
BIG CROWD
AT THE TAKE-OUT COUNTER.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.255
I MEET YOUR DAD TOMORROW.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.157
I KNOW.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.427
I WAS THINKING
THIS IS GONNA BE
A BIT MORE COMPLEX

16:36.429 --> 16:39.130
THAN THE USUAL
PARENT-TEACHER DISCUSSION.

16:39.132 --> 16:44.268
I MEAN, I CAN SEE
YOUR MOM'S A COLLEAGUE,
SHE'S SAFE.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.739
BUT YOUR DAD IS YOUR DAD.
WHICH IS COMPLEX.

16:47.741 --> 16:50.174
YOU WILL LIKE HIM,
HE'LL LIKE YOU.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.977
JUST BE YOUR NORMAL
INCREDIBLE SELF.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.417
WHAT IS HE AFTER?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.886
HE'S PROBABLY
JUST WHAT HE SAYS HE IS--

17:01.888 --> 17:04.756
A NEPHEW CLEANING UP
AFTER A DISTANT RELATIVE.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.024
"PROBABLY"?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.626
I'LL KNOW MORE AFTER
THE SECOND MARTINI.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.961
( doorbell rings )

17:16.136 --> 17:17.201
HELLO.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.738
CALEB. WOW.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.273
HELLO, MRS. MARIN.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.075
HANNA THOUGHT IT WAS
ABOUT TIME YOU AND ME MET.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.843
I DID?

17:25.845 --> 17:29.013
I DID. UM...
MOM, THIS IS CALEB.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.782
RIVERS.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.918
NICE TO MEET YOU, CALEB.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.854
MRS. MARIN,
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOME...

17:36.856 --> 17:37.889
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN OF IT.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.692
CALEB IS NEW TO
ROSEWOOD THIS YEAR.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.128
THEY BROUGHT ME IN
TO CLASS THE PLACE UP.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.531
I SEE.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.300
HANNA, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

17:56.276 --> 17:58.810
IS HE SOME SORT OF
REBOUND FROM SEAN?

17:58.812 --> 18:00.511
WHAT?! NO.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.847
I DON'T WANT YOU
ALONE WITH HIM IN THE HOUSE.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.350
GO OUT. IF YOU'RE GONNA STUDY,
GO TO THE LIBRARY.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.653
YOU LET ME STUDY HERE
WITH SEAN.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.489
WELL, I KNEW SEAN.
SEAN WAS A MINISTER'S SON.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.890
SEAN CALLED YOU
"HANNA BANANA."

18:12.892 --> 18:15.493
( doorbell rings )

18:15.495 --> 18:17.662
I'LL GET THAT
FOR YOU.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.596
HUH.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.066
HI.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.769
HELLO. I'M LOOKING
FOR MRS. MARIN.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.270
COME ON IN.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.742
SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN
WITH HANNA.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.045
HANNA...?
HER DAUGHTER.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.180
ARE YOU HER SON?

18:36.182 --> 18:38.916
NO. I'M JUST THE GUY
WHO OPENS THE DOOR.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.687
Ella:
MR. LELAND,

18:42.689 --> 18:44.422
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER HANNA.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.923
HELLO.
HELLO, HANNA.

18:47.494 --> 18:52.196
OH, I FORGOT TO GET
YOUR SIGNATURE ON THIS.

18:52.198 --> 18:55.399
IT'S JUST PART OF
AUTHORIZING YOU

18:55.401 --> 18:57.835
TO LOOK AT
THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

18:57.837 --> 18:58.970
SURE.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.383
THANK YOU.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.286
OKAY.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.289
UM...

19:18.291 --> 19:20.625
I WON'T BE LATE.
OKAY.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.670
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
COMING TO THE FRONT DOOR
LIKE THAT?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.772
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BETTER WAY TO MEET YOUR MOM

19:34.774 --> 19:36.641
THAN HER TRIPPING OVER ME
BEHIND THE FURNACE.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.509
YEAH, BUT JUST
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.245
WHY COULDN'T YOU
ASK ME?
YOU WOULD HAVE SAID NO?

19:41.247 --> 19:43.080
MY MOM THINKS
YOU'RE TROUBLE.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.516
AND YOU DON'T LIKE
HER NEW BOYFRIEND.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.085
HE'S NOT HER BOYFRIEND.
HE'S A CUSTOMER AT THE BANK.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.221
SOME ARCHITECT FROM SYRACUSE.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.958
REALLY.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.726
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "REALLY"?

19:55.728 --> 19:58.563
HE HAD A CRAPPY
PLASTIC PEN.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.331
SO?

20:00.333 --> 20:03.367
SO, ARCHITECTS
DRAW FOR A LIVING.

20:03.369 --> 20:07.371
THEY TEND TO BE PEN SNOBS,
STRICTLY MONT BLANC
AND BEYOND.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.106
WHY DOES HE CREEP<i> YOU</i> OUT?

20:09.108 --> 20:11.108
HE DOESN'T CREEP ME OUT.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.912
YES, HE DOES. YOU GET
A BAD VIBE FROM THE GUY.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.049
IT'S COMPLICATED.
TELL ME.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.483
I LIKE COMPLICATED.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.059
ARI DOES A GREAT DEAL
OF INDEPENDENT READING.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.962
YOU CAN SEE SHE'S EXCITED
BY THE IDEA OF FICTION.

20:30.964 --> 20:33.598
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
MAKES HER SUCH A GOOD STUDENT.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.500
SO YOU'RE TAKING MY WIFE OUT.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.336
UH--SORRY?

20:38.338 --> 20:40.404
WELL, YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH MY WIFE...

20:40.406 --> 20:41.839
TO SOME BOOK EVENT?

20:41.841 --> 20:44.675
RIGHT, RIGHT.
THE BOOK SIGNING NEXT WEEK.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.511
IT'S AN EVENT FOR AN AUTHOR
WE BOTH LIKE, LEONARD ADAMS.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.680
LEONARD ADAMS.
DO YOU--

20:49.682 --> 20:52.016
DO YOU THINK HE'S GOOD?

20:52.018 --> 20:54.352
I LIKE SOME OF HIS STUFF
VERY MUCH.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.254
ELLA'S A FAN, TOO.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.889
WELL, I THINK
HE'S A FAKE.
VERY OVERRATED.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.825
HE HAS HIS CRITICS.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.929
HE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T FIT IN
TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO
WITH ARIA'S CLASS.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.164
IS HE REALLY YOUR IDEA
OF A GOOD WRITER?

21:09.235 --> 21:11.902
WELL--I LIKE A LOT OF WRITERS

21:11.904 --> 21:15.273
FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.774
HMM. ( laughs )

21:16.776 --> 21:19.543
YEAH.
ELLA USED TO HATE HIM.

21:19.545 --> 21:23.214
I MEAN, I CAN REMEMBER
SHE THREW HIS LATEST NOVEL
CLEAR ACROSS OUR BEDROOM.

21:23.216 --> 21:25.316
SHE WAS SO ANGRY.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.585
BUT, UH, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'VE TURNED HER AROUND.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.857
HOW'D YOU MANAGE
TO DO THAT?

21:32.859 --> 21:34.759
A...SILENT AUCTION.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.628
FOR CHARITY.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.735
WHEN ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO SEE TOBY?

21:44.737 --> 21:49.707
TOMORROW, WHILE JENNA'S
AT HER MUSIC LESSON.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.175
TAKE IT.
NO.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.710
NO, YOU TAKE IT.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.446
THE STORM HAS PASSED.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.014
WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH YOU TWO?

21:59.085 --> 22:03.954
OKAY, SO, YOU KNOW HOW
I WENT TO THAT MUSEUM
WITH EZRA?

22:03.956 --> 22:07.258
WELL, "A" TRIED TO GET HANNA
TO RUIN IT.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.759
RUIN IT HOW?

22:08.761 --> 22:11.395
"A" GAVE ME ANOTHER TICKET

22:11.397 --> 22:14.498
AND MADE ME GIVE IT
TO ARIA'S MOM.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.801
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

22:16.803 --> 22:18.803
WELL, I TRIED TO STOP IT.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.839
I MEAN, HER MOM'S CAR
DIDN'T JUST STALL.

22:21.841 --> 22:26.777
CALEB FIXED IT
TO KEEP FROM GETTING THERE,
AND THAT'S WHY I OWE HIM.

22:26.779 --> 22:30.181
YEAH, AND HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN BREAKING INTO
VENDING MACHINES AT SCHOOL.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.583
I MEAN, HE'S PRACTICALLY
LIVING THERE.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.318
IN SCHOOL?

22:34.320 --> 22:37.421
Hanna: THEY FOUND HIS STUFF,
SO HE'S NOT SLEEPING THERE
ANYMORE.

22:37.423 --> 22:40.524
HE'S SLEEPING
IN MY BASEMENT.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.361
WAIT. REWIND THAT
A LITTLE FOR ME.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.429
DOES YOUR MOM KNOW?
NO, BUT--

22:45.431 --> 22:47.965
IT'S JUST FOR
A COUPLE OF NIGHTS.
A COUPLE OF NIGHTS?

22:47.967 --> 22:50.434
ARE YOU CRAZY?

22:50.436 --> 22:52.002
GUYS.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.238
Saleswoman: OH, WOW.
HOLD ON. TURN AROUND.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.643
IT FITS PERFECTLY.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.083
LET ME JUST PULL THIS OVER IT.

23:06.085 --> 23:10.454
THE LENGTH
LOOKS GREAT.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.190
I WANT IT TO BE PERFECT.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.092
HE LIKES LACE.

23:26.105 --> 23:29.173
I'M NOT MISINTERPRETING.
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOUR DAD CAME IN THERE

23:29.175 --> 23:30.541
LIKE HE WANTED TO CHOP ME OFF
AT THE KNEES.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.843
AND I'M TELLING<i> YOU</i>
THAT'S NOT MY DAD.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.746
I RECOGNIZED HIM
FROM THE PICTURE YOU SHOWED ME
OF EVERYBODY ON THE GLACIER.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.648
I'M SERIOUS.
SO AM I.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.784
I'M TRYING TO ACT LIKE I'M NOT
IN LOVE WITH HIS DAUGHTER,

23:39.786 --> 23:42.586
AND HE'S ACTING LIKE
HE WANTS TO CHALLENGE ME
TO A DUEL

23:42.588 --> 23:43.888
OVER YOUR MOTHER.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.790
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DO.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.058
HE HATES ME.
HE DOESN'T<i> HATE</i> YOU.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.261
HE<i> HATES</i> ME--
OR HE'S CRAZY.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.730
NO, HE DOES NOT HATE YOU.
HE COULDN'T.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.298
THEN HE'S CRAZY.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.757
PAM.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.358
OH, HEY, ELLA.
HOW ARE YOU?

24:21.360 --> 24:23.093
I'M OKAY.
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.395
BUT THEN I SAW YOU WERE
COMING IN

24:24.397 --> 24:26.664
FOR THE PARENT-TEACHER
CONFERENCES.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.232
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT THE SCHOOL

24:28.234 --> 24:30.000
IS NOT GONNA BE BULLIED
BY NICK McCULLERS.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.503
EVERYBODY HERE
LOVES EMILY.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.705
WHAT ABOUT NICK McCULLERS?

24:34.707 --> 24:38.175
UH, WELL, HE CAME IN
MAKING A BIG DEAL

24:38.177 --> 24:42.580
ABOUT HOW HE THINKS EMILY'S
GETTING SPECIAL TREATMENT
BECAUSE SHE'S GAY.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.049
EVERYBODY KNOWS
EMILY'S THE BETTER SWIMMER.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.350
EXCEPT McCULLERS.

24:46.352 --> 24:49.186
HE CAME HERE TO SCHOOL
AND SAID THAT?

24:49.188 --> 24:51.989
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
STUDENTS, TEACHERS.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.425
WAS EMILY THERE?
SHE WAS.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.209
HELLO?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.750
( hinges creak )

25:29.462 --> 25:30.928
HELLO?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.559
( lullaby plays )

26:04.263 --> 26:06.397
YOU BETTER PUT THAT BACK.

26:06.399 --> 26:10.234
PUT IT BACK WHERE YOU GOT IT
OR SHE'LL KNOW YOU WERE IN HERE.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.970
I'M SORRY. I KNOCKED.
THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.839
I HEARD YOU,
BUT I COULDN'T ANSWER THE DOOR.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.441
I WAS ON THE PHONE.

26:17.443 --> 26:19.443
MY LAWYER CALLED.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.478
THE D.A. IS DROPPING
THE CHARGES AGAINST ME.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.556
THEY'RE NOT GONNA CHARGE YOU
WITH KILLING ALISON?

26:32.558 --> 26:34.224
I DIDN'T GET THE DETAILS,

26:34.226 --> 26:37.261
BUT HE SAID
THE BLOOD EVIDENCE
WAS CORRUPTED.

26:37.263 --> 26:41.098
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
CAN'T GO TO TRIAL
WITHOUT IT.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.034
THEY'RE FINISHED WITH YOU?
NOT FINISHED.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.805
THEY CAN CHARGE ME
ANYTIME THEY FIND
NEW EVIDENCE. BUT...

26:47.807 --> 26:50.975
FOR RIGHT NOW,
I'M FREE,

26:50.977 --> 26:55.045
ONCE I GET
THIS BALL AND CHAIN
OFF MY LEG.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.048
I'M WAITING FOR MY DAD
TO TAKE ME TO THE COURTHOUSE
FOR THAT.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.785
I COULD DRIVE YOU.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.322
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

27:13.065 --> 27:17.201
SO, YOUR MOM DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU
WHEN YOU SAID LELAND WAS SHADY.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.670
YOU DON'T SOUND
VERY SURPRISED.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.372
I'M USED TO THAT,

27:21.374 --> 27:24.041
THAT'S WHY I CALLED
SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY.

27:24.043 --> 27:27.044
TALKED TO A NICE LADY
AT THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE

27:27.046 --> 27:28.579
ABOUT HOW I WAS
THINKING OF APPLYING

27:28.581 --> 27:30.648
AND DID SHE KNOW
A LOCAL GUY NAMED JAMES LELAND.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.483
YOU JUST CALLED UP
AND ASKED?

27:32.485 --> 27:35.119
PEOPLE LOVE TO TALK.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.687
AND GUESS WHAT?

27:36.689 --> 27:40.190
JAMES LELAND WENT TO S.U.
AND OPENED AN OFFICE IN TOWN.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.660
SEE? HE'S LEGIT.
YEAH.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.328
HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD
ARCHITECT...

27:44.330 --> 27:47.231
RIGHT UP UNTIL
HE DROPPED DEAD
TWO YEARS AGO.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.902
INTRODUCING
JAMES LELAND.

27:51.904 --> 27:55.139
WAIT--MY MOM SAID
HIS I.D. CHECKED OUT.

27:55.141 --> 28:00.978
RIGHT. YOU ASK A COMPUTER
"IS JAMES LELAND RELATED
TO THIS POTTER LADY?"

28:00.980 --> 28:02.479
THE COMPUTER SAYS YES.

28:02.481 --> 28:05.282
BUT YOU DIDN'T ASK
IF JAMES LELAND WAS STILL ALIVE.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.318
KNOWING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
IS BETTER THAN HAVING
ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.573
TOBY?

28:29.575 --> 28:32.910
MR. DUGAN CALLED
WITH THE GOOD NEWS.
DID YOU HEAR?

28:32.912 --> 28:36.146
HE TOLD ME.
WE CAN GET THAT AWFUL THING
OFF YOUR LEG RIGHT NOW.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.082
THE CAB'S WAITING.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.284
THAT'S ALL RIGHT...
I'VE GOT A RIDE.

28:43.622 --> 28:44.888
EMILY.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.824
NO, IT'S ME.

28:48.994 --> 28:51.161
SPENCER.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.564
IT'S REALLY VERY NICE OF YOU,
BUT I'M HERE NOW.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.469
I'M GOING WITH SPENCER.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.510
I SEE.

29:15.888 --> 29:19.089
HANNA, THE MAN'S I.D.
CHECKED OUT.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.792
IT CHECKED OUT
BECAUSE THERE<i> WAS</i> A JAMES LELAND
RELATED TO MRS. POTTER.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.595
BUT THIS ISN'T HIM.
THIS IS SOMEBODY ELSE.

29:24.597 --> 29:28.065
IF I TELL THE STATE PEOPLE
SOME STORY ABOUT THE MAN
BEING AN IMPOSTER,

29:28.067 --> 29:30.901
IT'LL JUST DRAW ATTENTION,
WHICH WE DO NOT WANT.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.803
WELL, WE HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING.

29:32.805 --> 29:35.405
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING BASED ON
WHAT THIS BOY CALEB SAYS.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.775
LELAND'S COMING TO THE BANK
THIS AFTERNOON,

29:37.777 --> 29:39.810
I WILL SHOW HIM
THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.

29:39.812 --> 29:42.646
AND...
WE WILL GO FROM THERE.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.082
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
CALL ME WHEN HE LEAVES.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.650
I WILL.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.826
HEY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE GONE ALL DAY.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.327
UH, CHANGE OF PLANS.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.963
GOOD. I'LL TAKE YOU AND MIKE
OUT FOR DINNER LATER.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.398
OKAY?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.666
HEY, DAD?

30:02.668 --> 30:04.668
HOW WERE
THE PARENT-TEACHER MEETINGS?

30:04.670 --> 30:06.703
OH, THEY WERE FINE.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.506
YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKE
THAT ONE TEACHER,
YOUR FRENCH TEACHER.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.842
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE MR. FITZ?

30:11.844 --> 30:13.944
HE WAS OKAY.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.880
"OKAY"?

30:16.882 --> 30:19.349
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I'M GONNA TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.318
I THOUGHT
HE WAS A LIGHTWEIGHT.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.820
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:22.822 --> 30:26.423
WELL, THERE'S JUST NOT
A LOT OF DEPTH THERE.

30:26.425 --> 30:31.361
BOY, THAT'S...THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE I LIKE HIM.
HE'S A GOOD TEACHER.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.864
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
HE'S A HIT WITH THE KIDS,

30:33.866 --> 30:36.600
I MEAN,
HE'S A NICE-LOOKING GUY,
HE'S EASYGOING.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.969
HE DOES THAT BOYISH SMILE THING
A LITTLE TOO MUCH,

30:38.971 --> 30:40.537
BUT I FIGURE THAT MUST
WORK FOR HIM.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.307
WHAT'S THAT THING ABOUT
JUDGING A BOOK BY ITS COVER?

30:43.309 --> 30:46.343
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT'S INSIDE
BASED ON THE COVER.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.848
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE'S PUBLISHED.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.916
ONLINE JOURNALS
AREN'T "PUBLISHED."

30:52.918 --> 30:54.885
"PUBLISHED" IS INK AND PAPER.

30:54.887 --> 30:58.856
WELL, YOU WERE WITH HIM
LIKE, WHAT, HALF AN HOUR?

30:58.858 --> 31:01.925
I'M IN HIS CLASS EVERY DAY.
WELL, EVERY ENGLISH
DEPARTMENT HAS ONE--

31:01.927 --> 31:05.229
FULL OF CHARM AND PROMISE.
IT'S--

31:05.231 --> 31:08.565
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU--
AND YOUR MOTHER--
SEE MORE OF HIM THAN I DO,

31:08.567 --> 31:11.401
BUT PERHAPS THAT'S WHY
I HAVE A CLEARER PERSPECTIVE.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.503
WHAT'S MOM
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

31:13.505 --> 31:17.541
WELL, SHE'S NOT IMMUNE
TO THAT KIND OF CHARM.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.910
THIS BOOK SIGNING THING
HE'S TAKING HER TO...

31:19.912 --> 31:22.512
THAT'S NOT JUST MOM.
HALF OF THE TEACHERS

31:22.514 --> 31:25.215
IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
ARE GOING.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.017
WELL...

31:27.019 --> 31:29.887
LISTEN, WHEN MIKE COMES HOME,
WE'LL PICK A PLACE FOR DINNER.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.993
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS?

31:38.030 --> 31:40.464
THREE THOUSAND,
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.501
IT'S FUNNY...

31:44.503 --> 31:46.637
YOU DON'T HAVE EXPECTATIONS,

31:46.639 --> 31:49.273
AND THEN YOU END UP
HAVING EXPECTATIONS.

31:49.275 --> 31:53.977
THE FAMILY MYTH WAS THAT
AUNT ESTHER HAD A LOT OF CASH
SOCKED AWAY SOMEWHERE.

31:53.979 --> 31:55.913
A LOT MORE THAN
THREE THOUSAND.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.782
THE BANK DOESN'T ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE TO KEEP CASH

31:58.784 --> 32:01.551
IN SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.453
SO, SHE SPOKE TO YOU
ABOUT KEEPING MONEY IN HERE?

32:03.455 --> 32:05.923
NO. WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT IT.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.959
WHO ELSE BESIDES YOU
WOULD HAVE ACCESS
TO THIS BOX?

32:08.961 --> 32:11.228
ANY OFFICER.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.797
OF COURSE, YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE
THE CUSTOMER'S KEY,

32:13.799 --> 32:16.967
OR THE MASTER,
LIKE I USED.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.236
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

32:19.238 --> 32:21.171
JUST THINKING.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.646
WHERE DO YOU BANK, JAMES?

32:29.648 --> 32:32.382
IN SYRACUSE?

32:32.384 --> 32:33.951
WHERE DO I BANK?

32:33.953 --> 32:37.354
YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS,
BUSINESS ACCOUNTS.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.589
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR BANK?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.661
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.631
THE RULES ON ACCESS
ARE THE SAME, INDUSTRY-WIDE.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.370
CALL THEM AND ASK?

32:55.174 --> 32:56.573
THEY HAVE SATURDAY HOURS,
DON'T THEY?

33:00.379 --> 33:04.014
LIKE I SAID,
IT WAS JUST A FAMILY MYTH.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.760
Boy: GREAT MEET, GUYS.
Girl: WAY TO GO, SHARKS!

33:16.762 --> 33:17.961
COME HERE.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.001
I DON'T NEED A RIDE.
MY CAR IS IN THE PARKING LOT.

33:24.003 --> 33:26.737
NO, I NEED TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.773
I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING
BEFORE I TALK TO THE SCHOOL.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.342
TALK TO THE SCHOOL
ABOUT WHAT?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.211
IS IT TRUE WHAT
ARIA'S MOM TOLD ME

33:34.213 --> 33:36.213
ABOUT MR. McCULLERS
COMING TO THE SCHOOL

33:36.215 --> 33:38.215
AND SAYING YOU GOT SOME KIND
OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT?

33:38.217 --> 33:40.384
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.
EMILY, IS IT TRUE?

33:40.386 --> 33:41.418
IS THIS TRUE? BECAUSE--

33:41.420 --> 33:42.452
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.222
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

33:45.224 --> 33:47.457
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHY I WOULDN'T TELL YOU?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.693
IT'S BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.428
I KNOW WHAT YOU'D SAY:

33:51.430 --> 33:54.398
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO I AM,
I BETTER GET USED TO PEOPLE

33:54.400 --> 33:56.466
LOOKING AT ME
ONLY ONE WAY.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.006
NICK.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.908
HELLO, PAM.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.410
WE NEED TO TALK.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.412
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN I'D HEAR FROM YOU.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.580
THIS ISN'T PERSONAL.

34:10.582 --> 34:13.784
YOU DEAL WITH YOUR FAMILY
PROBLEMS ANY WAY THAT YOU WANT.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.319
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE SCHOOL
IS DOING TO MY DAUGHTER.

34:16.321 --> 34:19.356
( scoffs ) YEAH.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

34:19.358 --> 34:22.726
IT'S ABOUT YOU TRYING TO
MAKE HER INTO SOME KIND OF
PROFESSIONAL VICTIM

34:22.728 --> 34:24.661
AND USING MY DAUGHTER TO DO IT.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.030
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.466
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU ALWAYS THINKS THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE TO BLAME

34:29.468 --> 34:30.967
WHEN THINGS
DON'T GO YOUR WAY.

34:30.969 --> 34:33.370
OKAY, YOU'RE UPSET--
NO, NOT YET.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.672
BUT I'M GETTING THERE.

34:35.674 --> 34:39.109
MY DAUGHTER
NEVER GOT ANYTHING
SHE DIDN'T EARN.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.778
THAT'S HOW WE RAISED HER.
THAT IT WHO SHE IS.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.346
SO YOU DROP THIS, NICK.

34:43.348 --> 34:46.116
DROP IT, OR I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT A REAL AGENDA LOOKS LIKE.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.125
MOM.
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:55.127 --> 34:57.561
I'M FINE. COME ON,
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.796
MY CAR'S IN THE LOT.
RIGHT. OKAY.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.265
SO I'LL JUST MEET YOU AT HOME
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.767
MOM...

35:06.405 --> 35:07.737
EMILY--

35:09.608 --> 35:13.009
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND...

35:13.011 --> 35:14.878
BUT I LOVE YOU.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.516
YOU ARE MY CHILD,
AND NOBODY HURTS MY CHILD.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.722
I'M SO SORRY IF I...

35:39.638 --> 35:43.039
Spencer:
YOU COULD JUST KEEP GOING.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.908
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.877
THEY COULD PULL ME BACK
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

35:49.548 --> 35:53.683
ANYWAY...I DON'T LIKE RUNNING.

35:53.685 --> 35:56.153
I'VE DONE TOO MUCH OF IT.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.496
YOU COULD START
TO GET YOUR LIFE BACK.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.766
I'M NOT SO SURE
I WANT IT BACK.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.669
NOT THE WAY IT WAS.
I HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.974
I FIGURED OUT
WHAT THE MESSAGE MEANS.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.844
BRAILLE USES
THE SAME SYMBOLS
FOR LETTERS AND NUMBERS.

36:20.846 --> 36:25.482
IT WASN'T B-A-D,
IT WAS THE NUMBER 2-1-4.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.384
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.786
I DON'T KNOW.
TOBY.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.358
I HEARD JENNA IN HER ROOM

36:35.360 --> 36:38.028
ON THE PHONE
TALKING TO SOMEBODY.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.731
I DON'T KNOW WHO...
BUT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.367
TALKING ABOUT ME?

36:44.369 --> 36:48.371
JENNY USED THE EMBOSSER
ATTACHED TO HER COMPUTER,

36:48.373 --> 36:51.708
AND I SLIPPED IN
AND MADE A RUBBING
OF WHAT SHE PRINTED OUT.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.211
TWO-ONE-FOUR.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.713
DOES THAT NUMBER
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

36:56.715 --> 36:59.382
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.184
A HOUSE NUMBER,
AN AREA CODE--

37:01.186 --> 37:04.287
WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT,
FOR BOTH OUR SAKES.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.592
ARE YOU AFRAID OF JENNA?

37:10.529 --> 37:12.062
I WAS.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.898
I STILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO CROSS HER.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.033
SHE'S GOT THE POWER
IN THAT HOUSE.

37:18.971 --> 37:21.137
BUT...

37:21.139 --> 37:23.506
I'M NOT AFRAID OF HER
THE WAY I USED TO BE.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.844
THAT MAKES HER NERVOUS.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.447
<i> YOU</i> MAKE HER
NERVOUS.

37:30.449 --> 37:33.149
I DO?

37:33.151 --> 37:35.785
I THINK
SHE'S AFRAID OF YOU,

37:35.787 --> 37:38.588
AND THE REST
OF ALISON'S FRIENDS--

37:38.590 --> 37:41.758
ALL OF YOU WHO WERE THERE
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.352
LISTEN,
IT'S LIKE YOUR MOM SAID,

38:09.354 --> 38:12.589
MY DAD IS ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY TO BLAME.

38:12.591 --> 38:16.826
I HAVE TO GO HOME.
MY MOM'S WAITING FOR ME.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.796
RIGHT.
YOUR MOM'S WAITING.

38:19.798 --> 38:23.066
GOD, WHY IS EVERYTHING
SO EASY FOR YOU?

38:23.068 --> 38:26.336
EASY? WHAT PLANET
DO YOU LIVE ON?

38:26.338 --> 38:29.472
I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE
TRYING NOT TO FEEL
THE WAY I FEEL.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.809
I COME OUT, AND THEY SHIP
MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND OFF
TO GOD-KNOWS-WHERE,

38:32.811 --> 38:34.678
AND NOW MAYBE
SHE'S DONE WITH ME.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.080
SO, YEAH,
IT'S ALL ABOUT EMILY--
ALL EM, ALL THE TIME.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.360
DON'T TELL.

38:59.004 --> 39:02.405
HEY,
NOT ALL OF IT.
MY MOM WILL NOTICE.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.441
TELL HER IT'S EVAPORATION.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.079
WALK ME HOME?

39:12.751 --> 39:17.020
UH, SO MAYBE YOUR MOM
WILL LET ME HANG AROUND
ON THE SURFACE NOW?

39:17.022 --> 39:19.589
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN
SUCH A HURRY TO GET TO ARIZONA.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.158
ARIZONA WILL BE THERE
WHENEVER I DECIDE TO SHOW UP.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.528
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.733
YOU'RE WELCOME.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.746
( doorbell rings )

39:49.488 --> 39:52.355
ARE YOU "A"?
EXCUSE ME?

39:52.357 --> 39:56.359
SOMEBODY CALLED FOR AN ESTIMATE.
SAID YOU HAD SOME KIND
OF INFESTATION IN YOUR BASEMENT.

39:56.361 --> 39:59.629
ONLY NAME THEY LEFT
WAS "A." IS THAT YOU?

39:59.631 --> 40:02.399
UH, NO. YOU HAVE
THE WRONG HOUSE.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.442
( phone ringing )

40:24.055 --> 40:26.089
( voicemail beeps )

40:26.091 --> 40:29.092
<i> MR. FITZ, THIS IS</i>
<i> BYRON MONTGOMERY,</i>
<i> ARIA'S DAD.</i>

40:29.094 --> 40:31.995
<i> LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT</i>
<i> HOW OUR MEETING WENT.</i>

40:31.997 --> 40:33.763
<i> I OWE YOU</i>
<i> A MAKE-GOOD ON THAT.</i>

40:33.765 --> 40:35.765
<i> I'VE READ YOUR STORIES</i>
<i> AND I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU,</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:37.567
<i> SO MAYBE WE COULD</i>
<i> HAVE A BEER?</i>

40:37.569 --> 40:40.637
<i> GIVE ME A CALL, OKAY?</i>
<i> THANKS.</i>

40:40.639 --> 40:43.039
SO, YOU WANT
AN EGG ROLL?
SOUNDS GOOD.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.777
<i> ¶ SOLVE ME ¶</i>

40:47.779 --> 40:51.281
<i> ¶ ALL MY PROBLEMS,</i>
<i> YOU CALL ME ¶</i>

40:51.283 --> 40:54.617
<i> ¶ LATE NIGHTS IN HARLEM</i>
<i> THE STREETS SPEAK ¶</i>

40:54.619 --> 40:56.820
<i> ¶ LIKE IT'S A STARLIT GHOST ¶</i>

40:59.724 --> 41:01.858
<i> ¶ ALWAYS ¶</i>

41:01.860 --> 41:04.928
<i> ¶ YOU'RE THROWING GLANCES</i>
<i> MY WAY ¶</i>

41:04.930 --> 41:09.032
<i> ¶ YOU LOOK AT ME</i>
<i> LIKE YOU COULD SAVE ME ¶</i>

41:09.034 --> 41:10.667
<i> ¶ YOU COULD, YOU KNOW ¶</i>
