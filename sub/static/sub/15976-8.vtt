WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:08.192
Well, Cordelia, the room seems

00:08.194 --> 00:11.863
presentable, but, uh...

00:14.635 --> 00:17.670
...you didn't use Dust It!

00:17.672 --> 00:18.738
No, Monsieur,

00:18.740 --> 00:20.474
I didn't think you'd notice.

00:20.476 --> 00:22.843
I used a cheaper brand.

00:22.845 --> 00:25.314
The finger doesn't lie.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.285
What are you guys watching?

00:27.287 --> 00:29.424
It's my dad's old Mr. Finger
campaign for Dust It!

00:29.426 --> 00:31.328
Someone put it on YouTube,

00:31.330 --> 00:33.098
and now it's got, like,
three million hits.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.199
But wait, I'm confused.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.700
She's French, he's British,

00:35.702 --> 00:37.134
there's a windmill.
What country is this?

00:37.136 --> 00:39.334
My dear, it was the '80s.
We had not yet begun

00:39.336 --> 00:40.836
to ask
those difficult questions.

00:40.838 --> 00:42.171
Plus, when I wrote it,
I'd just huffed

00:42.173 --> 00:43.305
half a can of the product.

00:43.307 --> 00:45.274
Anyway, now that the
campaign is popular again,

00:45.276 --> 00:47.074
we're gonna resurrect it,
and here's the best part...

00:47.076 --> 00:49.209
we landed the
real Mr. Finger.

00:49.211 --> 00:50.377
Oh, my God, he was available?

00:50.379 --> 00:51.913
Luckily he hadn't worked
in 22 years.

00:51.915 --> 00:53.047
I-I used to love
Mr. Finger.

00:53.049 --> 00:54.516
I dressed up as him
for Halloween.

00:54.518 --> 00:55.952
Uh, did you wear the
glove year-round?

00:55.954 --> 00:57.152
Did people mistake you
for Michael Jackson?

00:57.154 --> 00:58.387
Did you know, in
your heart of hearts,

00:58.389 --> 00:59.621
that you couldn't
sleep at night

00:59.623 --> 01:02.089
unless you had inspected
the school library for dust?

01:02.091 --> 01:04.024
No.
You win?

01:05.093 --> 01:06.660
Hey, there he is.

01:06.662 --> 01:09.661
Glenn Hastings,
everyone, aka Mr. Finger!

01:09.663 --> 01:10.695
HeHey!

01:10.697 --> 01:13.531
Hey, buddy, you
know they want it.

01:13.533 --> 01:16.066
Well, I never disappoint.

01:16.068 --> 01:18.802
The finger doesn't lie.

01:18.804 --> 01:20.803
His finger just gave me chills.

01:20.805 --> 01:22.038
Do you ever listen to yourself?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.005
Mr. Hastings,
I'm Sydney.

01:23.007 --> 01:24.873
We spoke on the phone. Oh,

01:24.875 --> 01:29.176
my God, I see that the face
is as lovely as the voice.

01:29.178 --> 01:31.111
Oh, charming and handsome.

01:31.113 --> 01:33.246
How is it possible
that you are single?

01:33.248 --> 01:35.114
My wife's dead.

01:38.519 --> 01:40.687
We are so happy
to have you here.

01:40.689 --> 01:43.089
We can't wait to give America
the finger all over again.

01:43.091 --> 01:44.991
The campaign is going to be
great; I will tell you

01:44.993 --> 01:46.059
all about it at dinner.

01:46.061 --> 01:47.560
I booked the early bird
just like you told me.

01:47.562 --> 01:49.194
Well, I just have to
finish a few things,

01:49.196 --> 01:50.228
and we'll get out of here.

01:50.230 --> 01:51.296
Oh, you know, Dad, you can stay.

01:51.298 --> 01:52.597
I'll take Mr. Hastings out.

01:52.599 --> 01:54.432
That way I get him
all to myself.

01:54.434 --> 01:55.766
Well,

01:55.768 --> 01:57.968
I'll just grab my restaurant
teeth, and we'll go.

01:57.970 --> 01:59.469
It's a date. You kids
have a good time, okay?

01:59.471 --> 02:02.505
Wow, I haven't seen
a can of this in years.

02:02.507 --> 02:04.439
Whew.
What are you, nuts?

02:04.441 --> 02:05.807
I'm in recovery over here.

02:05.809 --> 02:06.908
Sorry, I was just dusting.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.008
Yeah, that's what
we called it, too.

02:08.011 --> 02:09.043
Lemon was my polish of choice.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.911
No, I got to go
call my sponsor.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.113
Uh...

02:17.385 --> 02:18.584
Mm-hmm.

02:18.586 --> 02:21.219

02:35.367 --> 02:37.567
Ugh, how do those guys
from Accounting do it...

02:37.569 --> 02:39.669
dress like their dads,
staring at numbers all day?

02:39.671 --> 02:40.703
So boring.

02:40.705 --> 02:41.704
Poor idiots.

02:41.706 --> 02:43.005
Good news,
guys, we have a pitch

02:43.007 --> 02:44.839
next week
for Dixie Paper Plates.

02:44.841 --> 02:47.041
Stare at that for three hours,
see what you come up with.

02:47.043 --> 02:49.143
We're on it, boss.

02:51.846 --> 02:53.946
- You want to look at the back?
- Yeah.

02:53.948 --> 02:55.381
Exactly like I thought...

02:55.383 --> 02:57.150
Okay, creatives,
can everyone put down

02:57.152 --> 02:59.285
the Popsicle sticks
and finger paints

02:59.287 --> 03:01.721
or whatever it is you artistic
monkeys claim to do?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.088
Because we have a problem.

03:03.090 --> 03:06.557
Gordon Lewis... he's like a
truffle pig sniffing out joy.

03:06.559 --> 03:08.258
Gordon, what brings you out
of the land of the anal

03:08.260 --> 03:09.959
to the dirty den
of the creative?

03:09.961 --> 03:11.561
- Well, I'm very upset.
- Oh.

03:11.563 --> 03:13.329
And not just because my
husband is on a juice cleanse,

03:13.331 --> 03:14.396
so now I have to be.

03:14.398 --> 03:15.564
Why can't Timothy
get into barbecuing?

03:15.566 --> 03:16.598
Wouldn't that be nice?

03:16.600 --> 03:17.999
You know what I like
about you and Timothy?

03:18.001 --> 03:19.133
You've been married
since before everyone

03:19.135 --> 03:20.501
was gay.

03:20.503 --> 03:22.203
Yeah, it's like when your
favorite band gets popular,

03:22.205 --> 03:23.537
but I'm sticking with it.

03:23.539 --> 03:24.905
Yeah. All right, so I'm going
over the billing report

03:24.907 --> 03:28.008
in my office... the one that's
a full 100 square feet smaller

03:28.010 --> 03:29.942
than yours, even though
we're equal partners...

03:29.944 --> 03:31.410
- Uhhuh.
- ...and I find that.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.546
I am a beacon of light.

03:33.548 --> 03:34.780
Oh, that's an angel card.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.182
It's Timothy's other
stupid new thing.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.550
Here, what is this?

03:38.552 --> 03:42.119
That's a bill for the
Stan Wood Wallpaper account.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.221
Yes, I know it's a bill. How
come I've never heard of him?

03:44.223 --> 03:46.256
'Cause the air's thin up there,
you miss a lot of stuff.

03:46.258 --> 03:48.224
I've always wondered,
are you attracted to the tops

03:48.226 --> 03:49.158
of guys' heads?

03:49.160 --> 03:50.593
Does Timothy go up on you?

03:50.595 --> 03:52.695
See, I would consider
that a hate crime,

03:52.697 --> 03:55.797
but I think the real hate
crime is what we got going on

03:55.799 --> 03:57.131
right...

03:57.133 --> 03:58.165
Yeah.

03:58.167 --> 03:59.199
I can't do it.

03:59.201 --> 04:01.167
Timothy is so much
better at "the read."

04:01.169 --> 04:02.634
Stop diverting.

04:02.636 --> 04:03.568
Who's Stan Wood?

04:03.570 --> 04:04.802
You know who Stan Wood is.

04:04.804 --> 04:06.903
He's the loud guy
at the Christmas party,

04:06.905 --> 04:08.404
you know, the guy who eats
all the meatballs,

04:08.406 --> 04:09.638
you know, and he has
the holiday cologne

04:09.640 --> 04:10.639
that smells like meatballs.

04:10.641 --> 04:11.806
You even call him Meatballs.

04:11.808 --> 04:15.143
Nice try, but I have a
mind like a steel trap.

04:15.145 --> 04:16.444
Except to clip
those nostril hairs.

04:16.446 --> 04:18.245
It's like staring up
at two tiny armpits.

04:18.247 --> 04:19.512
Listen, I'd love to bask

04:19.515 --> 04:20.880
in the shade
of Kilimanjaro here,

04:20.882 --> 04:21.981
but we have that thing.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.749
Oh, yeah, that thing, guys.

04:23.751 --> 04:24.815
That thing already?

04:24.817 --> 04:26.250
Oh, I know there's no thing.

04:26.252 --> 04:27.550
Wait, do I need
a sweater for the thing?

04:27.552 --> 04:29.251
Wait, ho-hold on,
this is not over.

04:29.253 --> 04:32.886
I should know about even our
most piddly, D-level client.

04:32.888 --> 04:34.120
D-level client?

04:34.122 --> 04:36.422
At Lewis, Roberts & Roberts
all our clients are A-level,

04:36.424 --> 04:37.890
no matter
how D-level they are

04:38.926 --> 04:40.959
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

04:40.961 --> 04:42.527
You can apologize
in the morning.

04:42.529 --> 04:45.763
Oh, God, am I hungry.

04:45.765 --> 04:47.231
I had such a wonderful night.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.699
Yeah. And the best part is, it
all took place in the afternoon.

04:49.701 --> 04:51.667
The irony is,
in my sunset years

04:51.669 --> 04:52.967
I have yet to see one.

04:54.570 --> 04:57.170
I was worried you'd be bored by an
old man like me. Are you kidding?

04:57.172 --> 04:59.339
When was the last time
I went on a date with a man

04:59.341 --> 05:01.107
that shared my love
of Murder, She Wrote?

05:01.109 --> 05:03.076
Yeah. Okay, let
me get you a cab.

05:03.078 --> 05:04.679
You have a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

05:08.752 --> 05:10.585
My dear,

05:10.587 --> 05:13.154
you've worn me out.

05:13.156 --> 05:15.924
Would you please close the door

05:15.926 --> 05:18.093
after me?

05:18.095 --> 05:21.163
Good-bye, my darling,
until next time.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:33.577 --> 05:35.845
So, are we going to talk
about the elephant in the room?

05:35.847 --> 05:37.814
That your pants are so tight,
they're practically meggings?

05:37.816 --> 05:39.149
They give you a moose knuckle.

05:39.151 --> 05:40.450
Who is Stan Wood?

05:40.452 --> 05:44.187
Stan Wood is a secret
we thought best not to tell you.

05:44.189 --> 05:45.756
Oh, come on, you all knew?

05:45.758 --> 05:47.157
Secrets are not
your strong suit,

05:47.159 --> 05:49.459
he who told Gail in Research
about her surprise baby shower.

05:49.461 --> 05:52.094
She was still surprised, just
three days before the shower.

05:52.096 --> 05:53.929
And no one can take
that magical moment

05:53.931 --> 05:55.330
in the elevator away from her.

05:55.332 --> 05:56.499
Who is Stan Wood?

05:59.269 --> 06:02.606
Fine, I'll let you in.

06:02.608 --> 06:06.576
Stan Wood Wallpaper is really
Pete Hadary's Used Cars.

06:06.578 --> 06:07.577
But I thought we gave them up

06:07.579 --> 06:09.012
when we got
Midwest Regional Ford

06:09.014 --> 06:10.480
because of the conflict
of interest.

06:10.482 --> 06:11.915
We can't have two
car dealerships.

06:13.117 --> 06:15.118
Oh.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.220
Pete Hadary was
our very first account.

06:17.222 --> 06:18.788
But if Ford finds out...

06:18.790 --> 06:21.190
They'd fire us and we'd lose
our credibility.

06:21.192 --> 06:23.393
Simon, you know
how I feel about you.

06:23.395 --> 06:24.795
I'd carry your hair in a locket

06:24.797 --> 06:27.163
- if necklaces weren't weird on guys.
- Mmhmm.

06:27.165 --> 06:29.366
But do you think that this
is really worth the risk?

06:29.368 --> 06:32.068
Son, we have to have
some accounts

06:32.070 --> 06:33.436
where it's not just
about the money.

06:33.438 --> 06:36.005
The Stan Woods let
you sleep at night.

06:36.007 --> 06:37.207
I find an orgasm helps.

06:37.209 --> 06:38.808
I used to throw, like,
a fistful of downers

06:38.810 --> 06:40.943
into a blender
with cough syrup and warm milk.

06:40.945 --> 06:42.444
I called it Milk of Amnesia,

06:42.446 --> 06:43.945
but then sobriety
ruined all that.

06:43.947 --> 06:46.514
Now I need nonsense
like loyalty and ethics

06:46.516 --> 06:48.716
to get through the night.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.688
It was like a lizard flicking
its tongue in my mouth...

06:53.690 --> 06:56.723
or its tail...
whatever is grosser.

06:56.725 --> 06:58.758
Huh, so you
and Mr. Finger.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.427
Yeah, I can totally see that.

07:00.429 --> 07:01.628
That's your takeaway
from my story?

07:01.630 --> 07:04.031
An old man French-kissed me.

07:04.033 --> 07:06.032
I skew older sometimes, too.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.200
It takes a different skill set

07:07.202 --> 07:08.901
but can be
well worth the effort.

07:08.903 --> 07:12.905
Turns out stories of the old
country... really tutu me on.

07:12.907 --> 07:14.774
Why do I confide in you people?

07:14.776 --> 07:16.242
Just to blame the victim
for a minute here,

07:16.244 --> 07:17.978
are you sure
this isn't your fault?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.046
He assaulted me.

07:19.048 --> 07:19.980
You kind of led him on.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.748
Well, how?
How?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.016
You were all over him.

07:23.018 --> 07:25.119
"Well, aren't you
charming and handsome?

07:25.121 --> 07:27.521
How are you single?"

07:27.523 --> 07:29.590
That's not how I said it.

07:29.592 --> 07:30.858
Hmm, kind of was.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.528
Okay, maybe I said one thing.

07:34.530 --> 07:35.629
"I'll take Glenn out.

07:35.631 --> 07:38.599
That way I get him
all to myself."

07:38.601 --> 07:40.234
And then you really laid it on.

07:40.236 --> 07:41.202
"It's a date.

07:41.204 --> 07:43.103
How do you like your eggs?"

07:43.105 --> 07:45.840
Well, that last
part was implied.

07:45.842 --> 07:47.308
That was old man flirting.

07:47.310 --> 07:48.743
I didn't think it counted.

07:48.745 --> 07:50.245
He's not dead; of course
he's going to succumb

07:50.247 --> 07:52.180
to a pretty girl
that's coming on to him.

07:52.182 --> 07:53.849
Oh, my God, you guys are right.

07:53.851 --> 07:56.618
You're being mean about it,
but you're right.

07:56.620 --> 07:58.153
I feel so bad.

07:58.155 --> 07:59.454
Well, you should.

07:59.456 --> 08:00.756
He's a man
with a heart and a soul,

08:00.758 --> 08:03.291
who grew up penniless on
the mean streets of Cleveland.

08:03.293 --> 08:06.995
What, I'm the only one
who read his book I, Finger?

08:07.864 --> 08:09.097
Yeah.

08:09.099 --> 08:12.067
Yes, Timothy, I am loving
the juicing cleanse.

08:12.069 --> 08:15.770
I hardly miss
the 3,067 calories needed

08:15.772 --> 08:17.973
to keep a man my size alive.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.475
Yeah, I love you, too, honey.

08:20.477 --> 08:22.077
Yeah, yeah, I said it, o-o-okay.

08:22.079 --> 08:23.145
Simon!

08:23.147 --> 08:24.479
You bellowed? This
may be a surprise,

08:24.481 --> 08:26.648
but I called the contact number

08:26.650 --> 08:28.383
for Stan Wood,
and it went straight

08:28.385 --> 08:30.018
to a Vietnamese restaurant.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.853
Oh, you are
an amazing storyteller.

08:31.855 --> 08:33.154
How you spin a yarn.

08:33.155 --> 08:34.722
Okay, don't play that
game with me, tiny man.

08:34.724 --> 08:36.657
I'm starving,
I'll eat your head.

08:36.659 --> 08:37.991
Okay.

08:37.994 --> 08:39.126
Lauren, will you please find

08:39.129 --> 08:40.695
the correct number
for Stan Wood?

08:40.697 --> 08:42.464
Okay, it might take me a while.

08:42.466 --> 08:43.565
I'll wait... uh,
you know what?

08:43.567 --> 08:44.699
Better yet, why
don't you get him

08:44.701 --> 08:46.468
on the line for me right now?

08:46.470 --> 08:48.936
Lauren, let me help you
with that.

08:50.172 --> 08:52.306
Oh, hey, Gordon,
that's a great shirt.

08:52.308 --> 08:53.708
Who is that?
I don't know.

08:53.710 --> 08:55.109
Do you mind if I grab a ladder
and check the tag? Shirt.

08:56.279 --> 08:57.912
I just want to see the tag.
All right, relax.

08:57.914 --> 09:01.216
Ralph Lauren, wow, nice,
nice, worth the climb.

09:01.218 --> 09:03.251
Yeah, well, I just wear what
Timothy lays out on the bed.

09:03.253 --> 09:04.553
Yeah, yeah, I know.

09:04.555 --> 09:06.121
What are you doing?
No, I...

09:06.123 --> 09:08.524
Oh, excuse me.

09:08.526 --> 09:09.491
Lewis, Roberts & Roberts.

09:09.493 --> 09:10.492
Hello.

09:10.494 --> 09:11.860
Stan?
Great.

09:11.862 --> 09:13.261
Hey, how are you?

09:13.263 --> 09:14.329
Good... listen, I
want to put you

09:14.331 --> 09:15.931
on the line with Gordon Lewis.

09:15.933 --> 09:18.967
Right, right, from the
Christmas party, okay.

09:20.603 --> 09:24.607
Uh, hello, would this be
Mr. Stan Wood by any chance?

09:24.609 --> 09:25.841
Tak.

09:25.843 --> 09:27.510
I say yes in Polish.

09:27.512 --> 09:29.580
Excuse me, English sometimes
not so quick.

09:29.582 --> 09:31.214
I understand.

09:31.216 --> 09:32.849
You're Polish?
Well, that makes sense.

09:32.851 --> 09:35.218
There's a lot of
Poles in Chicago.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.220
Largest concentration
of Poles outside of Poland.

09:37.222 --> 09:38.154
Very big...

09:38.156 --> 09:39.489
Kick a pierogi down the street,

09:39.491 --> 09:41.591
you'll see who comes out
of the house.

09:41.593 --> 09:43.460
You know,
I've always wondered,

09:43.462 --> 09:46.396
what is the capital of Poland?

09:46.398 --> 09:48.398
Oh, that is a great question.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.333
You know, it's one
for the ages.

09:50.335 --> 09:52.102
I remember, is a beautiful city

09:52.104 --> 09:53.670
with many city streets
and buildings,

09:53.672 --> 09:54.871
lots of building.

09:54.873 --> 09:56.273
It's in the middle of Poland.

09:56.275 --> 09:58.375
You know, I think
its name is...

09:58.377 --> 09:59.276
Warsaw.

09:59.278 --> 10:00.511
Ah, Warsaw.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.379
Is this the road
we're gonna go down, Simon?

10:02.381 --> 10:04.214
You don't want to tell me
who Stan Wood is,

10:04.216 --> 10:07.550
maybe I'll just have
to ask Weak Link.

10:11.088 --> 10:15.424
Hello, little canary,
time to start singing.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.062
Who's Stan Wood?

10:20.098 --> 10:23.700
Well, this is uncomfortable,
but I can handle it.

10:26.604 --> 10:28.705
It's getting harder.

10:31.609 --> 10:33.644
Gordon,

10:33.646 --> 10:37.581
Stan Wood Wallpaper is
Pete Hadary's Used Cars.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.682
Did I say that?

10:38.684 --> 10:39.850
I didn't say that,
Simon said that.

10:39.852 --> 10:40.917
Simon's the snitch, yeah.

10:40.919 --> 10:42.820
I'm so sorry, thank you so much

10:42.822 --> 10:45.322
for your honesty, sir,
in this moment of truth.

10:45.324 --> 10:48.226
Yes, yes, yes.

10:54.116 --> 10:55.216
That can't be good
for your cleanse.

10:55.218 --> 10:56.651
The cleanse is off.

10:56.653 --> 10:59.387
I'm six-eight. I can't live
on honey water and sunlight.

10:59.389 --> 11:02.857
And you know damn well that we
can't have two car dealerships.

11:02.859 --> 11:05.426
It's a conflict of interest!

11:05.428 --> 11:08.563
What is this? Kiwi Kick Go-Gurt.
Well, a girl could do worse.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.231
- I'm not doing that much, you know?
- Mmm.

11:10.233 --> 11:12.501
Billboard, Saturday Auto page,
you know how they produced

11:12.503 --> 11:14.236
- a commercial involving a llama.
- That's your commercial?

11:14.238 --> 11:15.538
With the dancing llama?

11:15.540 --> 11:17.240
I put him in the top hat.
The llama came up

11:17.242 --> 11:18.775
with the dance steps on his own.

11:18.777 --> 11:20.410
- I paid for most of it myself.
- Mmm.

11:20.412 --> 11:22.379
Tell you what. You don't tell
Ford about Hadary,

11:22.381 --> 11:24.748
and I won't tell Timothy
about you speedballing a cake.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.916
Simon,

11:25.918 --> 11:30.020
do you know why I decided
to become your partner?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.821
Because I trusted you.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.590
It was the night we met.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.826
25 years ago, freezing cold.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.928
You're standing in the middle
of Lake Shore Drive Yeah.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.064
Wearing nothing
but your tighty whities

11:40.066 --> 11:44.202
and you bet me 2,000 bucks that
you could outrun a city bus.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.803
Wasn't fair.
The bus had snow tires.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.272
True. But you still paid up.
Yeah.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.241
And after I Purell'd that wad
of cash that you pulled out

11:50.243 --> 11:52.343
from your underwear,
I said to myself,

11:52.345 --> 11:54.278
"That is a man I can trust."

11:54.280 --> 11:55.313
Come on. Where's your heart?

11:55.315 --> 11:56.981
Pete was your first client, too.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.616
Here's a question you have
to ask yourself:

11:58.618 --> 12:00.885
do you choose the account
that pays us millions

12:00.887 --> 12:03.721
and lets Denise over here send
her kids to private school?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.991
My name's Tammy.
And I've got pugs.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.693
Or do you keep
the piddly account

12:07.695 --> 12:09.061
that you have to pay
for yourself?

12:09.063 --> 12:10.329
That's what you have to decide,

12:10.331 --> 12:13.665
what is best for the agency
and Denise's pigs.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.799
Tammy. Pugs.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.701
You have until Monday
to clear this up.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.170
Monday, Si!

12:19.172 --> 12:20.705
Yeah.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.909
No pressure.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.379
E-Excuse me.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.448
Mr. Hastings? I was wondering
if we could talk about Hi.

12:29.450 --> 12:31.250
Last night. There's something
I want to clear up. Hmm?

12:31.252 --> 12:33.718
I should've refused
when you offered to pay.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.921
Uh, here.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.558
Here's a sawbuck. I won't
hear of change. Uh, oh.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.095
What I-I wanted to talk
to you about, um, was...

12:43.097 --> 12:44.263
the kiss.

12:44.265 --> 12:47.666
Oh. S-So, I...

12:47.668 --> 12:50.202
misread the moment.

12:50.204 --> 12:53.605
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.474
Y-You made me...

12:55.476 --> 12:58.710
think I was desirable
and attractive.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.579
You are attractive.

13:00.581 --> 13:02.714
My dear,
you're very sweet, but...

13:02.716 --> 13:04.483
I'm a silly old man.

13:04.485 --> 13:07.286
Nobody wants to jump
on my brittle old bones.

13:07.288 --> 13:08.754
Oh, that's not true.

13:08.756 --> 13:10.389
I'm sure there's plenty of
women that would love to...

13:10.391 --> 13:13.659
cautiously jump
your brittle bones.

13:13.661 --> 13:15.261
You are a lovely
dinner companion.

13:15.263 --> 13:18.096
Well, if you think
I'm a lovely dinner companion,

13:18.098 --> 13:20.799
I'm an even better lunch date!

13:20.801 --> 13:22.033
I'll pick you up tomorrow
at noon.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.401
Okay.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.439
I'm dating an 80-year-old.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.509
This is Tommy.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.679
He's only eight, but
he's a real spitfire.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.014
He's a Toyota Corolla.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.216
He's a Toyota Corolla.

13:38.218 --> 13:42.220
Take a look at my
little Ruthie.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.889
She's a Pinto. I'll bet she
has an explosive personality.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.925
Boom.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.493
Pete.
Hmm?

13:48.495 --> 13:49.894
I need some advice.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.429
Let's just say hypothetically

13:51.431 --> 13:53.632
that you were an ad agency
with two competing accounts.

13:53.634 --> 13:57.602
And one of them, you know, keeps
your employees fed and housed

13:57.604 --> 13:59.972
and the other one you have
to pay for yourself.

13:59.974 --> 14:02.274
Which would you keep?
I'd keep my account.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.076
Let's say one of them
brings in millions and the other

14:04.078 --> 14:06.311
could get the agency shut down.
I'd keep my account.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.712
What if you could
go back in time

14:07.714 --> 14:10.215
and prevent Abraham Lincoln
from going to the theatre

14:10.217 --> 14:12.785
- that dark and fateful night?
- I would keep my account.

14:14.389 --> 14:16.723
Pete, I'm very sorry,

14:16.725 --> 14:18.925
but I can't keep your account.

14:23.866 --> 14:26.700
I'm sorry, Simon. I forgot.
What's the safe word again?

14:26.702 --> 14:27.868
Lauren, can't this thing
hit harder?

14:27.870 --> 14:29.469
Maybe you can set it
to "Ike Turner."

14:29.471 --> 14:31.304
No one remembers him
for his songwriting skills.

14:31.306 --> 14:32.771
So sad. Pete wants to retire,

14:32.773 --> 14:34.139
and all of his money is
in those cars

14:34.141 --> 14:35.440
on that lot.
You had to keep

14:35.442 --> 14:36.775
the bigger account, boss.
You'll find

14:36.777 --> 14:37.977
a different way
to sleep at night.

14:37.979 --> 14:39.378
Still pitching orgasm.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.413
What about loyalty?

14:40.415 --> 14:41.782
Pete was a good man
and a minority.

14:41.784 --> 14:43.450
He checked a lot of boxes.
Who knows?

14:43.452 --> 14:45.886
Maybe he'll sell all
of his inventory this weekend.

14:45.888 --> 14:48.422
53 cars? There's no way
he'll sell them all himself.

14:48.424 --> 14:50.190
But maybe there's a way
to sell 'em with the help

14:50.192 --> 14:51.792
of the best sales team
in Chicago.

14:51.794 --> 14:52.994
Kaepernick Ford
on Dempster Street?

14:52.996 --> 14:53.994
He sold my dad a minivan.

14:53.996 --> 14:55.496
He just went in
to ask for directions.

14:55.498 --> 14:58.032
It's on a fixed income.
It's caused a lot of tension.

14:58.034 --> 15:01.736
My mom's talking
about leaving him. Anyway,

15:01.738 --> 15:05.072
Sydney could finish the Dust It! Campaign
and the rest of us will sell the cars.

15:05.074 --> 15:07.641
Us?
Why not? We're advertisers.

15:07.643 --> 15:09.677
We'll sell anything to anyone.
We're basically a pimp

15:09.679 --> 15:11.478
in a mink hat away
from being whores.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.147
I had a somewhat loftier view
of our role in the world,

15:13.149 --> 15:15.515
but, like I always say,
be the best at whatever you do,

15:15.517 --> 15:17.183
so paint your lips,
push up the girls

15:17.185 --> 15:18.685
and let's get that
bitch to polka!

15:18.687 --> 15:20.887
Yeah! - Yeah! - Let's do this!

15:20.889 --> 15:22.856
Huh.

15:22.858 --> 15:26.059
No.

15:26.061 --> 15:27.561
Oh, hi. Uh, I was

15:27.563 --> 15:29.830
just wondering if I could ask
Mr. Finger a question.

15:29.832 --> 15:32.933
It's more of a request.
Actually, if I seem nervous,

15:32.935 --> 15:34.668
it's because I'm
a really big fan.

15:34.670 --> 15:36.502
Of his. I don't
know your work.

15:36.504 --> 15:37.770
Hey, if this goes well,

15:37.772 --> 15:40.406
do you think you could
take a picture of us tog...

15:40.408 --> 15:42.808
I'll just take a selfie
'cause it's more flattering.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.744
How's that one? Better?
Just do it myself.

15:44.746 --> 15:47.180
No, this-this glove seems fine.

15:47.182 --> 15:50.584
Now, let's see
if it shows any dirt.

15:50.586 --> 15:53.620
Dirt.

15:53.622 --> 15:55.956
Oh, my.

15:55.958 --> 15:59.459
You're very dirty.

15:59.461 --> 16:01.761
Okay. Those gloves
are fine.

16:01.763 --> 16:04.197
Hey.

16:04.199 --> 16:06.432
What was that with
the wardrobe lady?

16:06.434 --> 16:08.734
Where-where... where am I?

16:08.736 --> 16:10.536
I'm going through

16:10.538 --> 16:11.971
the change.

16:11.973 --> 16:14.407
Have you seen my pills?
No, no, no.

16:14.409 --> 16:17.543
Don't play the feeble
old... woman with me.

16:17.545 --> 16:19.078
You're a dirty dog.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.447
Hey, this place is crawling
with beautiful women.

16:21.449 --> 16:24.483
What do you expect me to do?
Not be creepy to them!

16:24.485 --> 16:26.485
Wait till you're my age. Then
let's see if that's possible.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.088
You made Sydney feel terrible.

16:28.089 --> 16:29.988
You made her feel
like she was leading you on.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.757
Charge it to the game, playa.

16:31.759 --> 16:33.526
You're supposed to be
a defender of cleanliness.

16:33.528 --> 16:35.796
Huh? You don't deserve
to be Mr. Finger.

16:35.798 --> 16:37.131
No. Please.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.867
Please. This is
my big comeback.

16:39.869 --> 16:43.203
Here. Come, come.
Can't we patch this up somehow?

16:43.205 --> 16:44.638
All right.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.741
Because I am a great keeper
of secrets.

16:47.743 --> 16:50.811
But in return, you'll need to do
a little favor for me.

16:50.813 --> 16:53.013
Anything you want.

16:53.015 --> 16:57.050
I'm a lot like James Dean
that way.

16:57.052 --> 16:58.651
No. Not that.

16:58.653 --> 17:00.620
Huh?
Something else.

17:00.622 --> 17:01.922
That's right!

17:01.924 --> 17:04.458
Huge savings!

17:04.460 --> 17:06.359
We're cleaning house!

17:06.362 --> 17:08.996
The finger

17:08.998 --> 17:11.198
doesn't lie!

17:11.200 --> 17:12.199
That's great.

17:12.201 --> 17:13.566
Just six more hours.

17:13.568 --> 17:16.368
I hate you.

17:20.936 --> 17:24.204
Wow. People showed up.
Advertising really works.

17:24.207 --> 17:26.205
Now all I have to do is
transform those eyers

17:26.208 --> 17:28.474
into buyers, turn those
looky-losers into yes-I-dosers.

17:28.477 --> 17:29.942
I feel like you might be
making these up.

17:29.944 --> 17:32.009
Took you four years
to figure that out.

17:32.011 --> 17:33.543
Now, the most important thing
you need to know

17:33.545 --> 17:34.524
about selling cars,

17:34.542 --> 17:35.081
Uhhuh.

17:35.107 --> 17:36.230
is that when you sell one,

17:36.247 --> 17:38.481
you get to ring that bell.

17:38.483 --> 17:40.583
You don't get to ring the
victory bell unless you've made

17:40.585 --> 17:43.320
a sale. Now I've got to use
the "never mind" horn.

17:43.322 --> 17:44.988
Never mind!

17:44.990 --> 17:46.323
Oh. Glad we cleared that one up.

17:46.325 --> 17:47.724
Pete, we're gonna
get you to Boca.

17:47.726 --> 17:49.259
Retirement, kicking back.

17:49.261 --> 17:50.727
Hopefully you're not one
of those guys who dies suddenly

17:50.729 --> 17:51.728
when he stops working.

17:51.730 --> 17:52.729
Boca on three!

17:52.731 --> 17:54.965
One, two, three. Boca!

18:00.071 --> 18:02.439
How 'bout those Bears, huh?

18:02.441 --> 18:04.875
This car is so comfortable it's
like sitting in Mike Ditka's lap.

18:04.877 --> 18:07.178
Roomy enough for Dick Butkus
and his forehead.

18:07.180 --> 18:10.481
"The Refrigerator" Perry could
fit in the trunk.

18:11.318 --> 18:12.250
Hey, there. The
horsepower

18:12.252 --> 18:13.651
on this little beaut is higher

18:13.653 --> 18:15.854
than Mike Ditka's cholesterol.

18:15.856 --> 18:18.289
And you can fit a mimicentury
vanity in the hatchback

18:18.291 --> 18:19.557
while antiquing.

18:22.194 --> 18:24.894
♪ Hey, must be the money ♪

18:24.896 --> 18:26.763
Now, this baby's a little bit
more expensive,

18:26.765 --> 18:30.033
but I feel like she's calling
your name.

18:30.035 --> 18:32.770
I don't know what it is about
this car that speaks to me.

18:32.772 --> 18:34.104
♪ I like ♪

18:34.106 --> 18:35.606
♪ Those stylish clothes
you wear ♪

18:35.608 --> 18:38.075
It's got responsive steering,
a capable chassis,

18:38.077 --> 18:40.777
perfect safety scores. The
backseat's on the small side,

18:40.779 --> 18:42.946
but we should all have
that problem, am I right?

18:42.948 --> 18:44.581
We weren't thinking
about buying two cars,

18:44.583 --> 18:46.316
but there's just something
about this one.

18:46.318 --> 18:49.652
♪ Hey, must be the money

18:49.654 --> 18:51.654
I have sold the most so far.

18:51.656 --> 18:53.856
If anyone is counting,
I'm ahead.

18:53.858 --> 18:56.359
Not anymore.

18:56.361 --> 18:58.427
Why's everything
a competition with you?

18:58.429 --> 19:00.096
What are we doing, people?
Come on. Let's go.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.764
We still got a few cars left.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.833
No, no. You-You've done enough,
son, really.

19:03.835 --> 19:06.003
Um, this is...
this is the nicest thing

19:06.005 --> 19:08.305
anyone has ever done for me.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.210
Besides, I-I need at
least one car left

19:12.212 --> 19:13.911
to make it look
legit when I burn

19:13.913 --> 19:15.980
the place down
for the insurance money.

19:15.982 --> 19:16.982
You're a good man, Pete!

19:16.984 --> 19:20.118
This was kind of cool.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.486
You've just had
an emotional orgasm,

19:21.488 --> 19:23.121
a soul-gasm, if you will.

19:23.123 --> 19:26.658
I'm just glad that it was with
someone safe like Pete. Yeah.

19:28.628 --> 19:31.596
All you clowns go on break
at the same time?

19:31.598 --> 19:33.999
Gordon, what a surprise. Come here to gloat?
Actually, no.

19:34.001 --> 19:36.267
Timothy found a Snickers wrapper
in my pants pocket,

19:36.269 --> 19:37.736
so now I'm buying him a car.

19:37.738 --> 19:39.304
Seems a little extreme.
Timothy is

19:39.306 --> 19:41.873
a former Olympic diver
with five-percent body fat.

19:41.875 --> 19:46.611
So... this buys that a car. Oh.

19:46.613 --> 19:48.179
Gordon, you know
why I became partners with you?

19:48.181 --> 19:50.882
That night when we met
on Lake Shore Drive

19:50.884 --> 19:52.884
and I was shivering
in my tighty whities,

19:52.886 --> 19:55.587
a Sasquatch of a man took off
his circus tent of a jacket

19:55.589 --> 19:56.588
and he wrapped it

19:56.590 --> 19:58.490
around me.

19:58.492 --> 20:00.825
I know you don't want
to admit, but, um...

20:00.827 --> 20:03.995
you really are a good guy.

20:03.997 --> 20:06.096
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:06.098 --> 20:07.731
No?
No.

20:07.733 --> 20:09.066
Okay.

20:09.068 --> 20:11.602
So... about that car...

20:30.288 --> 20:32.223
My yogurt's not here.

20:32.225 --> 20:34.558
Oh. It's right down low.
I couldn't see that.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.826
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

20:35.828 --> 20:37.361
I can't see below five feet.

20:37.363 --> 20:38.996
Forgive me. I bet.

20:38.998 --> 20:41.098
Where's Robin?

20:41.100 --> 20:44.035
I'm over here, big
man. I'm over here.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.841
- How slim are they?
- They're slim and matter-of-fact.

20:50.843 --> 20:52.876
I'll tell you right now.
The pants are so slim...

20:52.878 --> 20:55.578
Are you having slim pants? It's like...
like a pipe cleaner

20:55.580 --> 20:56.746
wearing a small dog.

21:00.350 --> 21:02.852
Pull my finger.

21:04.655 --> 21:07.423
I went to Juilliard.
