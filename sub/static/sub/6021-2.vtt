00:05.605 --> 00:07.835
George, you're not really
handicapped, are you?

00:08.575 --> 00:10.600
I've had my difficulties.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.809
I saw you running
down Amsterdam Avenue...

00:13.980 --> 00:17.916
...lifting that 200-pound motorized cart
with one hand.

00:18.284 --> 00:21.310
Mr. Thomassoulo,
during times of great stress...

00:21.488 --> 00:23.922
...people are capable
of superhuman strength.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.318
Have you ever seen...

00:25.492 --> 00:27.392
-...<i>The Incredible Hulk</i>, sir?
-No.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.757
How about the old
<i>Spider-Man</i> live-action show?

00:30.930 --> 00:34.024
George, I realize that we've signed
a one-year contract with you.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.863
But at this point, I think it's best
if we both go our separate ways.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.437
I don't understand.

00:39.606 --> 00:42.404
We don't like you.
We want you to leave.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.433
Clearer.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.808
-So you're staying at Play Now?
-Why not?

00:50.984 --> 00:53.646
The pay is good, I got dental
and private access...

00:53.820 --> 00:56.880
...to one of the great handicapped
toilets in the city.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.753
But they know you're not handicapped.
Aren't you ashamed?

00:59.926 --> 01:01.416
They're the ones that should be.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.289
They signed me
to a one-year contract.

01:03.463 --> 01:07.399
As long as I show up for work
every day, they have to pay me.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.296
-Hey.
-Hello.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.664
Hello, Elaine.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.439
-What's that?
-It's just his stupid thing.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.041
Well, I'm sure it's stupid.

01:17.544 --> 01:18.772
It's not about me, is it?

01:18.945 --> 01:21.277
-No.
-Not at all.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.916
-Tell me.
-All right.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.075
-You know this girl Claire I'm seeing?
-Yeah.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.584
He and I started joking
that when she falls asleep...

01:28.755 --> 01:31.246
...her stomach stays awake
all night and talks to me.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.052
-How's it talking?
-Well, the bellybutton's like a mouth.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.559
I'm bored.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.993
Talk to me.

01:39.165 --> 01:43.158
Oh, I gotta start taking these
"stupid" warnings more seriously.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.439
-Hey, look who's here. Puddy.
-My Puddy?

01:46.606 --> 01:50.542
-We broke up.
-And yet he continues to live.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.236
Hey, Benes.

01:53.413 --> 01:54.846
-How are you?
-I'm doing great.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.311
Great.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.845
-See you.
-Well, that's it.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.611
You two are back together.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.449
-What?
-The bump-into.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.057
The bump-into,
always leads to the backslide.

02:06.226 --> 02:09.957
David and I will not
be getting back together.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.655
Elaine, breaking up is like
knocking over a coke machine.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.663
You can't do it in one push.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.793
You gotta rock it back and forth
a few times, and then it goes over.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.234
That's beautiful.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.466
What about you?
You were even engaged...

02:23.643 --> 02:25.304
...and you cut it off just like that.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.675
That's different.
I had no feelings for those people.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.543
But you, you'll backslide.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.150
-You wanna bet?
-Stakes?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.876
-Fifty.
-Dollars?

02:34.053 --> 02:35.816
-All right. Witness?
-Witness.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.047
-Done.
-Percentage?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.918
-No.
-No.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.689
-So I'll call you tonight?
-Yeah.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.192
What's wrong with the belt?

02:46.366 --> 02:49.893
At the movies last night, I went
to the bathroom and I unbuckled wildly...

02:50.069 --> 02:53.300
...and the buckle kind of banged
against the side of the urinal...

02:53.473 --> 02:54.997
...so that's it.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.008
-So you're insane.
-Oh, yes. Quite.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.513
-Hello.
-Of course, it's a sliding scale.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.377
See you later.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.342
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.954
Look at this:
They're redoing the Cloud Club.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.925
The restaurant
on the Chrysler Building?

03:17.096 --> 03:19.621
-Good idea.
-Of course it is. It's my idea.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.893
I conceived this whole project
two years ago.

03:23.069 --> 03:26.038
Which part? The "renovating
the restaurant you don't own" part...

03:26.206 --> 03:29.733
...or "spending the 200 million
you don't have" part?

03:30.143 --> 03:32.543
I come up with these things,
I know they're gold...

03:32.712 --> 03:34.373
...but nothing happens.
You know why?

03:34.547 --> 03:37.175
No resources, skill, talent,
ability, brains--?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.045
No. No time.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.743
It's all these menial tasks.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.117
Laundry, grocery shopping,
coming in here and talking to you.

03:44.290 --> 03:48.659
Do you have any idea how much time
I waste in this apartment?

03:50.163 --> 03:51.960
I could ballpark it.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.900
Hello.

03:55.268 --> 03:59.068
Here we go. Now she comes in.
My whole day is shot.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.806
I called you last night.
Where were you?

04:01.975 --> 04:05.308
I went out with a friend.

04:05.478 --> 04:08.641
-George?
-No. No. No.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.908
Well, I was here. That's everyone.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.921
Are those the same shoes
as yesterday's?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.392
You know,
I wear these shoes all the time.

04:23.563 --> 04:27.499
Your hair, it's somewhat depoofed.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.430
Oh, it's the new look, you know?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.570
Heroin chic.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.808
Wait a second.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.409
-What's going on here?
-Nothing.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.102
Nothing!

04:41.547 --> 04:43.538
You're wearing the same clothes
as yesterday.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.208
-You saw Puddy.
-Oh, hoochie-moochie.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.786
-Game over. Pay up.
-No.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.857
It was an isolated sexual incident.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.927
-We are not back together.
-Then what do you call it?

04:56.095 --> 04:58.393
People don't just bump
into each other and have sex.

04:58.564 --> 04:59.792
This isn't Cinemax.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.528
It was no big deal, okay?

05:02.702 --> 05:05.535
We fooled around, then we went out,
grabbed a little dinner.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.605
Dinner? That's it.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.366
-What?
-You're all the way back.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.344
Sex, that's meaningless.
I can understand.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.377
Dinner, that's heavy.
That's an hour.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.243
2.9-percent financing
on a Toyota one-ton.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.216
That was my idea too!

05:25.692 --> 05:27.887
-Good morning.
-Go to hell.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.519
-Hi, Alice. That's a nice dress.
-Don't even look at me.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.223
-Hey, Glenn.
-Go to hell.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.564
Heard that one already.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.506
So that's the bedroom.
Here's the bathroom.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.076
You need to familiarize yourself
with the kitchen.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.975
Yeah, go ahead and look through
some of the drawers.

05:50.350 --> 05:55.811
-And you are...?
-Oh, hey, I'm Darin. I'm new here.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.950
Yeah, that's Jerry.
You don't have to worry about him.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.586
Why don't you go and get started
on that mail?

06:01.761 --> 06:03.626
-Right.
-Okay, good.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.695
He's a go-getter.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.724
-Who's he?
-My intern from NYU.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.938
You remember my corporation,
Kramerica Industries?

06:15.108 --> 06:17.042
-All right.
-Yeah, well apparently...

06:17.210 --> 06:19.576
...NYU is very enthusiastic
about their students...

06:19.746 --> 06:22.874
...getting some real-world
corporate experience.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.485
But you only provide fantasy-world
corporate experience.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.950
Well, this'll really free up my time...

06:29.122 --> 06:32.091
...so I can focus on more important
things, like my bladder system.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.158
-All right, it's time to go.
-No, Jerry.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.296
-It's not for people. It's for oil tankers.
-I know.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.658
The idea is a rubber bladder
inside the tanker...

06:39.832 --> 06:42.630
...so if it crashes,
the oil won't spill out.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.292
That is not a bad idea.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.295
Now it's time to go.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.971
-Hello?
-<i>Hello.</i>

06:52.145 --> 06:55.171
Hello.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.374
-<i>What's going on?</i>
-Siege mentality, Jerry.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.984
They want me out of here.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.587
They've downgraded me
to some sort of a bunker.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.484
I'm like Hitler's last days here.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.626
-So you gonna leave?
-<i>Oh, no. I'm invigorated.</i>

07:07.794 --> 07:09.455
They'll never get me out.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.187
I'm like a weed, Jerry.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.594
I thought you're like Hitler
in the bunker.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.030
I'm a weed in Hitler's bunker.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.170
I'm uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.

07:18.337 --> 07:19.599
<i>I got another call. See you.</i>

07:20.807 --> 07:23.503
-Hello?
-<i>Hi, this is Darin from Kramer's office.</i>

07:23.676 --> 07:27.203
Mr. Kramer would like to schedule
lunch with you at Monk's coffee shop.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.479
-Really? When?
-Ten minutes.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.644
-Do you need directions?
-No, I don't.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.518
-I'll call back in five minutes to confirm.
-Yeah, five.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.154
-Hey.
-Hey. So where's my money?

07:42.328 --> 07:44.455
No money. I'm Puddy-free.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.690
-So are we eating or what?
-Oh, yeah, hold on.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.927
Hello, Darin, this is Jerry
from Jerry's office.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.538
We're gonna be three for lunch.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.698
What do you mean he's already left?

07:58.811 --> 08:00.369
Hey, Elaine's gonna come with us.

08:00.546 --> 08:01.979
-When did this happen?
-Just--

08:02.148 --> 08:03.945
Darin!

08:07.987 --> 08:10.854
<i>I am not calling Puddy.</i>

08:12.258 --> 08:14.590
<i>What did I do with my gloves?</i>

08:14.894 --> 08:17.624
<i>Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy's.</i>

08:17.797 --> 08:20.698
<i>I should call him.
I need those gloves.</i>

08:20.867 --> 08:22.459
<i>No, I better not.</i>

08:22.635 --> 08:24.296
<i>I'll call him.</i>

08:24.837 --> 08:26.805
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>

08:26.973 --> 08:29.305
<i>There are the gloves.
I was just about to call.</i>

08:29.475 --> 08:31.375
<i>And there they are. That's funny.</i>

08:31.544 --> 08:32.943
<i>That's really funny.</i>

08:33.111 --> 08:36.240
<i>That is really, really funny.</i>

08:36.616 --> 08:40.073
<i>You know who loves funny stories?
David Puddy.</i>

08:41.787 --> 08:43.083
Play Now's through playing.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.190
They turned the heat
way up in my office.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.124
Tried to sweat me out.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.262
Do you have to write
all this stuff down?

08:50.429 --> 08:52.329
Mr. Kramer's in a meeting
with Mr. Lomez...

08:52.498 --> 08:54.466
...but he didn't wanna miss anything.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.900
So how hot did it get?

08:58.070 --> 09:01.130
I don't know, 120, 130.

09:01.307 --> 09:04.936
Then they sent some guys in
to sandblast for six hours.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.511
Tomorrow,
they're putting in asbestos.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.374
I guess you can take anything
but actual work.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.142
Bring it on.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.879
-Hello, Kramer.
-Welcome.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.216
I'm sorry. I couldn't get out of there.
What did I miss?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.156
After ordering, Mr. Seinfeld
and Mr. Costanza debated...

09:22.328 --> 09:25.126
...on whether Iron Man
wore some sort of undergarment...

09:25.298 --> 09:26.993
...between his skin and his iron suit.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.599
I say he's naked under there.

09:28.768 --> 09:31.168
-That makes a lot of sense.
-Shut up.

09:31.337 --> 09:34.670
Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom,
at which point...

09:34.840 --> 09:37.400
...Mr. Costanza scooped ice
from Mr. Seinfeld's drink...

09:37.577 --> 09:40.273
...with his bare hand,
and used it to wash up.

09:40.446 --> 09:43.279
And then Mr. Costanza
then remarked to me:

09:43.849 --> 09:45.817
"This never happened."

09:51.958 --> 09:55.189
-What's so funny?
-Oh, nothing.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.791
What are you laughing about?
Tell me.

10:00.967 --> 10:05.199
All right, but this is really dumb,
really stupid.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.972
We've been doing this
silly kind of voice.

10:09.141 --> 10:14.101
-So is it fun humiliating me?
-No, it's not you. It's your stomach.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.512
He's talking with this funny,
booming, jovial voice.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.447
Hello.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.645
-So you think I'm fat?
-No, it--

10:22.822 --> 10:24.153
Mr. Kramer says, "Hey, buddy."

10:24.323 --> 10:27.190
We're in the middle of something.
You mind coming back later?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.692
-Sure. Should we set something up--?
-Get out!

10:31.364 --> 10:34.128
-I'm leaving too.
-Nobody said you're fat.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.961
He's a lovable character.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.864
He's like the Kool-Aid guy.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.529
-He is fat.
-No. He's just a little bloated.

10:41.707 --> 10:45.643
-Goodbye!
-It's mostly water weight!

10:45.811 --> 10:48.245
Boysenberry. Kid's still learning.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.974
Mr. Kramer, the dean
of my internship's on line two.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.051
-She wants to set a meeting.
-Yeah, well, nothing before noon.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.614
-Line two?
-Yeah, your phone is line one.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.884
So the gloves
were right by the phone?

11:03.062 --> 11:04.859
That is pretty funny.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.423
See? This is what Jerry
doesn't understand.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.828
We can see each other.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.731
We can see each other,
but it doesn't mean we're together.

11:11.904 --> 11:14.270
No. I mean, I love just seeing you
and having sex.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.103
-Yeah.
-Not having to do all that...

11:18.277 --> 11:20.871
-...you know, work.
-Well, either way....

11:21.047 --> 11:24.107
-All that calling you and buying stuff.
-David.

11:24.283 --> 11:27.912
Hearing about how everyone at work
isn't as smart as you. It's brutal.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.220
All right, that's it.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.085
-We're back together.
-Oh, no.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.820
-Oh, yeah.
-Look, Elaine, be reasonable.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.657
Get those clothes off.
You're spending the night.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.026
-We're gonna cuddle.
-What?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.225
You heard me: strip.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.074

11:56.716 --> 11:58.479
All right.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.178
Okay.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.321
All right.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.875
Hello, Marjorie. George Costanza.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.342
How are you, sweetheart?

12:27.513 --> 12:30.380
Listen, could you give
Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me?

12:30.549 --> 12:34.542
Yes. If he needs me,
tell him I'm in my office!

12:34.720 --> 12:35.948
Thanks, dear.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.756
Dean Jones,
you wanted to talk to me?

12:41.127 --> 12:43.322
I've been reviewing
Darin's internship journal.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.630
-Doing laundry?
-Yeah.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.794
Mending chicken wire?

12:49.135 --> 12:51.603
High tea with a Mr. Newman.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.602
I know it all sounds
pretty glamorous...

12:53.773 --> 12:56.708
...but it's business as usual
at Kramerica.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.371
Far as I can tell...

12:58.544 --> 13:01.445
...your enterprise is a little more
than a solitary man...

13:01.614 --> 13:04.549
...with a messy apartment, which may
or may not have a chicken.

13:07.453 --> 13:11.014
And with Darin's help,
we'll get that chicken.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.884
I'm sorry, but we can't allow Darin
to continue working with you.

13:15.060 --> 13:19.121
Well, I have to say,
this seems capricious and arbitrary.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.526
Your fly's open.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.362
You're sure you're not angry
about last night?

13:25.538 --> 13:26.766
No. I'm fine.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.737
Just as long as you don't ever
do that voice again.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.171
-Never?
-Never.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.243
-What about if you're not around?
-No.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.040
I have to choose between
seeing you and doing the voice?

13:36.215 --> 13:37.580
-That's right.
-I can do that.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.014
-What's your decision?
-I don't know.

13:55.434 --> 13:58.028
Hello.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.074
Jerry, hi.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.550
Hello.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.960
-You broke up with her? Why?
-So we could do the voice.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.970
-What's the matter?
-I think I'm getting tired of it.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.971
I mean, is that all it does?
Hello and...?

14:36.141 --> 14:38.701
It could do anything.
It could be Spanish.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.473
Hello.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.873
I like the girl better than the voice.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.986
Really? Hello.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.486
-Still?
-I told you.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.156
All right, here you go.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.553
Choke on it.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.592
See. Never bet against the backslide.

14:56.762 --> 14:59.492
-I knew you two would get back together.
-Not for long.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.065
-I'm breaking up with him.
-Oh, I don't think so.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.794
I've seen you together.
You make each other miserable.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.096
It's kismet.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.967
-Double or nothing?
-Done.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.973
-Witness.
-You're in there again?

15:11.143 --> 15:13.839
I think Play Now
is putting something in my food.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.672
All right, I'm out of here.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.812
What is this?

15:19.985 --> 15:22.453
I don't know.
I found them in your closet.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.758
Since Darin left,
I can't find anything.

15:27.927 --> 15:32.728
He took all my clothes
to some cleaners. I'm clueless.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.867
-Is that clock right?
-Yeah. 9:00.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.799
I was supposed to pick up Newman
at the zoo 12 hours ago.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.206
Goodbye, Kramer.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.502
Jerry, buddy, I gotta tell you something.
That voice is played.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.669
-Really?
-So played.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.608
I told you.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.757
Darin. What are you doing here?

16:01.927 --> 16:04.122
The college canceled the internship.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.196
I don't care about the internship.

16:06.365 --> 16:07.855
I care about Kramerica.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.194
No, no, no. Kramerica is no more.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.166
What about
the tanker bladder system?

16:12.338 --> 16:15.034
We were gonna put an end
to maritime oil spills.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.336
Probably.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.443
Darin, you go home.
Forget about Kramerica.

16:25.217 --> 16:28.243
-Well, you're still here?
-I haven't had time to leave.

16:28.420 --> 16:31.184
Well, I haven't changed my mind.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.291
You are a tenacious little monkey.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.724
All right, I'll do it.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.659
-Kramerica Industries lives.
-Yes.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.561
-Let's get to work.
-Okay.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.162
Let's see what Jerry's got to eat.

16:47.306 --> 16:49.274
You win, George. We've had it.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.006
You leave right now...

16:52.177 --> 16:55.704
...and Play Now
will give you six-months' pay.

16:55.881 --> 16:58.748
That's half of your entire contract.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.943
Please, just go.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.517
See, if I stay the whole year...

17:05.691 --> 17:08.057
-...I get it all.
-Wanna play hardball, huh?

17:08.227 --> 17:09.717
Fine.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.057
Attention, Play Now employees.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.792
George Costanza's handicapped
bathroom on the 16th floor...

17:16.969 --> 17:21.372
...is now open to all employees
and their families.

17:23.142 --> 17:26.634
-Well played.
-I'll see you in hell, Costanza.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.908
Claire, thanks for giving me
a second chance.

17:32.084 --> 17:36.612
Our relationship is certainly worth more
than some silly, stupid voice.

17:36.789 --> 17:37.778
Hold on one second.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.424
-We don't wanna do the voice anymore?
-Don't think so.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.186
All right, we're back together again.
Great. Bye-bye.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.166
-Hey.
-Trouble down at the plant?

17:52.337 --> 17:53.827
It's a drum of oil.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.804
Darin and I are finally gonna test
my bladder system.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.806
You have to drink that whole thing?

17:59.611 --> 18:01.977
No, no, no. It's for oil tankers.

18:02.147 --> 18:05.082
All I need to do is fill
a rubber container with oil...

18:05.250 --> 18:08.185
...then drop it to see
if it can withstand the impact.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.116
I understand.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.156
Would a giant rubber ball work?

18:14.326 --> 18:15.816
Conceivably.

18:15.994 --> 18:18.827
Well, Play Now has all kinds
of different rubber balls.

18:18.997 --> 18:22.694
Why don't we test
your bladder system at my office?

18:22.868 --> 18:24.495
-You're not.
-Oh, yes, I am.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.366
Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.473
Well, there's nothing dirtier...

18:29.641 --> 18:31.541
...than a giant ball of oil.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.841
You wanna split a Reuben?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.106
I don't think so, David.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.647
We're through.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.316
That's a nice sweater.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.523
That was a doozy.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.729
-Go again?
-Book it.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.390
Witness.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.902
David, I know this hurts,
but it's the way it has to be.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.679
I'm gonna go get some popcorn.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.214
-So how did it end?
-They got away.

19:19.858 --> 19:23.555
Listen, David, I've gotta run.
Can you lend me 50 bucks?

19:27.065 --> 19:28.054
Hey.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.258
-Jerry, you bring the video camera?
-Yeah.

19:30.435 --> 19:31.834
I put a six-hour tape in.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.462
That should cover the experiment,
the arrest and most of your trial.

19:35.641 --> 19:36.869
-I'll see you.
-Yeah.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.340
Oh, you might wanna stick around,
Jerry.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.411
Mr. Thomassoulo
picked the wrong man...

19:41.580 --> 19:44.174
...to hire because
he was fake handicapped.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.248
I can't. I gotta meet Claire.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.913
-You gave up the voice?
-Yeah, that was stupid.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.715
-Unless you're liking it again.
-No.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.591
-Darin?
-Sorry, Mr. Seinfeld.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.252
-Bathroom?
-Hey, use mine. I'll let you in.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.762
I thought it was open to the public.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.364
I took care of that.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.534
Xanadu.

20:13.979 --> 20:16.914
No wonder you're putting in
so many hours.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.910
-May l?
-I insist.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.081
I'll fix us a drink.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.778
I got it.

20:27.125 --> 20:30.117
You know, Darin,
if you had told me 25 years ago...

20:30.295 --> 20:32.126
...that some day
I'd be standing here...

20:32.297 --> 20:34.492
...about to solve the world's
energy problems...

20:34.666 --> 20:36.258
...I would've said you were crazy.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.127
Now, let's push this giant ball
of oil out the window.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.610
So check out my view.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.806
There's Claire. I better go down.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.248
Hey, there's Kramer and Darin.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.043
There's the giant ball of oil.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.251
Claire's right underneath that thing.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.360
Claire. Hello!

21:03.528 --> 21:05.428
Hello!

21:05.597 --> 21:07.428
Hello!

21:07.599 --> 21:08.930
I don't believe this.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.162
I'm not looking up,
if you're going to do that voice.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.101
Bombs away.

21:17.676 --> 21:19.610
This is going to be a shame.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.476
Hello.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.111
Well, that didn't work.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.351
Hey, how about this?

21:32.524 --> 21:34.822
Ketchup and mustard
in the same bottle?

21:34.993 --> 21:38.258
-Oh, that sounds interesting, sir.
-Yeah.

21:47.572 --> 21:50.006
Claire won her lawsuit
against Play Now.

21:50.175 --> 21:53.611
Gee, Play Now's filing for bankruptcy.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.610
-Guess you're not going in anymore.
-No.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.339
-They're not paying you--?
-No.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.484
-So you're pretty much--?
-Yeah.

22:01.286 --> 22:02.583
Whatever happened to Darin?

22:02.921 --> 22:06.687
Darin's going away
for a long, long time.

22:09.027 --> 22:12.121
Claire sure looked pretty funny
all covered in oil like that.

22:12.297 --> 22:17.234
Hello. I got beaned
with a giant ball of oil.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.529
I'm slippery as an eel.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.175
I'm just so glad it's back.

22:26.578 --> 22:28.808
See? This is good.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.345
This is the way it should be.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.040
You know,
why were we fooling ourselves?

22:33.218 --> 22:34.617
We belong together.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.447
Elaine, I wanna break up.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.748
Nuts.
