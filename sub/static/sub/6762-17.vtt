01:54.129 --> 01:55.872
Yo, West Beverly, don't forget

01:56.047 --> 01:58.288
West Beverly and Beverly
get together this Friday

01:58.466 --> 02:00.791
for the annual winter dance
starting at 8 p.m.

02:00.969 --> 02:02.214
in the West Beverly gym.

02:02.387 --> 02:03.466
Be there.

02:05.015 --> 02:06.758
God, l'll be glad
when finals are over.

02:06.933 --> 02:10.633
How do they expect us to study when
we have Christmas shopping to do?

02:10.812 --> 02:13.729
You know, only two more for me
tomorrow, and then l'm through.

02:13.899 --> 02:16.568
Enough about finals, let's talk
about something really important

02:16.735 --> 02:18.312
like what to wear to the dance.

02:18.487 --> 02:21.357
Hey, why don't you wear a big sign
that says l'm here with David Silver

02:21.532 --> 02:23.109
but l'm really still available?

02:23.284 --> 02:24.398
That's mean.

02:24.577 --> 02:25.857
Yes, but it's funny.

02:26.037 --> 02:28.160
You know,
l don't find that funny at all.

02:28.331 --> 02:30.703
Well, touchy.
You guys must be really getting close.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.908
Kelly, l already told you,
we are just friends.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.915
Big, big, big, big dance Friday night.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.633
- You going?
- Nope.

02:39.801 --> 02:41.509
- Why not?
- No date.

02:41.719 --> 02:44.126
Brandon, date optional.
That's a lame excuse.

02:44.347 --> 02:46.635
Okay, no date and l don't dance.

02:46.850 --> 02:50.016
lt's just called a dance.
You don't actually have to dance.

02:50.228 --> 02:52.304
Steve, let me put this
in very simple terms.

02:52.481 --> 02:54.972
l don't waltz, l don't rumba,
l don't foxtrot, l don't boogie.

02:55.150 --> 02:57.819
l don't like being in the same room
with people who are dancing.

02:58.028 --> 03:00.815
Yeah, well, l was actually thinking
of breaking down

03:00.989 --> 03:02.697
and asking Kelly to the dance.

03:02.866 --> 03:04.574
l think she deserves
another chance.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.991
You're giving her another chance?

03:07.204 --> 03:08.864
lsn't she the one
who broke up with you?

03:09.039 --> 03:11.956
Yeah, but l forgive her.

03:15.755 --> 03:16.834
Guess who.

03:17.006 --> 03:18.085
Hi, Steve.

03:18.257 --> 03:20.463
What gave it away?
My scent? My touch?

03:20.635 --> 03:22.426
Actually, it was your sweaty palms.

03:22.595 --> 03:24.255
Be nice or l'll go away.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.138
You're making it too easy.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.058
Hey, Friday night, what do you say?
You and me?

03:29.227 --> 03:30.769
Sorry, l already have a date.

03:30.979 --> 03:33.055
- So break it.
- No.

03:33.231 --> 03:35.437
Why not? Who's it with?

03:35.609 --> 03:37.518
Chuck Wilson.

03:37.694 --> 03:40.529
- What?
- You heard me.

03:42.157 --> 03:44.695
Nice thing to tell me
before l take a history final.

03:44.910 --> 03:46.452
What was l supposed to do?
He asked me.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.696
- Of course he did.
- You know, Steve,

03:48.872 --> 03:51.113
you are not the centre
of everybody's universe.

03:51.292 --> 03:53.249
What makes you think
Chuckie was thinking of you

03:53.460 --> 03:54.658
when he asked me to the dance?

03:54.837 --> 03:58.253
Because l know him better than
you do, and he doesn't care about you.

03:58.466 --> 04:01.135
Why is it that every time
some guy likes me, you try to ruin it?

04:01.344 --> 04:03.965
To me,
Chuck Wilson isn't just any guy.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.762
Steve, we're about
to take a final here.

04:09.477 --> 04:12.015
lf l flunk history, you can thank
Chuckie Wilson for me.

04:12.188 --> 04:14.227
What? You're losing it, man.

04:14.399 --> 04:15.809
l mean it, it's all because of him.

04:15.984 --> 04:18.557
Wait a minute, Steve,
you don't even talk to Chuck Wilson.

04:18.737 --> 04:19.767
What is he to you?

04:19.946 --> 04:22.271
You don't know who he is, do you?

04:23.033 --> 04:25.358
You don't watch nearly enough TV.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.995
Whoa, cowboy. Whoa, crash.

04:32.793 --> 04:36.707
Chuck Wilson was the little kid
on your mom's TV show?

04:36.880 --> 04:38.956
He's as obnoxious now
as he was then.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.247
He's got himself thrown out

04:40.467 --> 04:43.468
of practically every private school
in Los Angeles.

04:45.056 --> 04:47.677
Chuckie, what are you doing?

04:47.892 --> 04:49.469
Hi, Mom.

04:49.644 --> 04:52.810
But that's
your daddy's birthday cake.

04:52.980 --> 04:56.431
l was just testing it
to make sure it was good.

04:59.487 --> 05:01.360
l'm gonna be sick.

05:01.531 --> 05:03.191
Come on.

05:03.408 --> 05:05.234
He was just some stupid little kid.

05:05.452 --> 05:06.910
Not to me.

05:07.078 --> 05:09.533
When l was little, l used to go
to the studio to see my mom.

05:09.706 --> 05:12.410
They'd stick us together because,
you know, we're the same age.

05:12.584 --> 05:14.956
He'd hit me, bite me, pull my hair,
break my toys,

05:15.128 --> 05:17.369
and every time
l'd be the one who'd get blamed.

05:17.547 --> 05:20.631
- Why?
- Because he's a star, Brandon.

05:20.801 --> 05:22.295
A little 5-year-old with an attitude.

05:22.469 --> 05:24.461
And if he didn't get his way,
he wouldn't go on.

05:24.638 --> 05:26.630
A lot of millions rode
on that cute smile of his.

05:26.849 --> 05:29.850
So no one much cared
if little Steve-o was crying.

05:30.019 --> 05:31.347
Well, what about your mom?

05:32.730 --> 05:34.556
She played along.

05:34.732 --> 05:38.480
lt was all part of the job.
Know your lines, be nice to Chuckie.

05:38.694 --> 05:40.437
Come on,
it was ten or 1 2 years ago.

05:40.947 --> 05:43.153
You were just little kids,
he could have changed.

05:45.201 --> 05:47.739
You know what he said
when l first saw him at West Beverly?

05:47.912 --> 05:51.281
''Watch out, Steve-o,
Chuckie's back.''

05:51.458 --> 05:52.786
You know, like the movie?

05:53.543 --> 05:54.823
He was kidding.

05:55.003 --> 05:56.876
You're just letting him get to you,
that's all.

05:57.047 --> 06:00.001
l thought he was out of my life.
First thing l see him at West Beverly,

06:00.175 --> 06:02.251
- and you're not gonna believe this.
- What?

06:02.469 --> 06:05.672
They're talking about doing
a big Hartley House reunion show.

06:07.683 --> 06:09.675
- Brandon.
- Hi.

06:09.852 --> 06:11.975
Steve, you didn't tell me
we had company.

06:12.146 --> 06:13.225
Brandon's not company.

06:13.397 --> 06:16.267
So, Steve tells me you're gonna be
doing a Hartley House reunion.

06:16.484 --> 06:17.942
- Congratulations.
- Don't jinx it.

06:18.110 --> 06:21.526
We haven't signed the deal yet.
But Norman says it looks good.

06:21.739 --> 06:25.439
We may even get a TV movie,
if Charles agrees to it.

06:25.660 --> 06:28.233
- Charles?
- Little Chuckie.

06:28.746 --> 06:33.040
Whatever you do, gorgeous,
do not call him that at dinner tonight.

06:33.751 --> 06:36.123
On second thought,
l think l'll eat at Brandon's.

06:36.337 --> 06:37.368
Funny.

06:37.547 --> 06:39.124
l know you two
have had your differences

06:39.299 --> 06:41.172
but this really means a lot to me.

06:45.263 --> 06:46.342
l'll get it.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.183
Hi, Steve. How you doing?

06:52.354 --> 06:54.393
Fine, Chuckie.

06:54.940 --> 06:56.600
So coming to the dance on Friday?

06:56.775 --> 06:59.230
- Well, maybe.
- Oh, you have to come.

06:59.403 --> 07:02.072
Kelly and l will be really hurt
if you don't show.

07:02.239 --> 07:03.781
What's your problem?

07:03.949 --> 07:07.318
No problem. So is it true?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.109
ls what true?

07:09.330 --> 07:12.284
That Kelly Taylor
is a really great first date.

07:12.792 --> 07:13.990
That's it, get out.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.241
Hey, man, chill. Chill.

07:15.420 --> 07:18.504
Look, we're not at the studio,
no one's forcing me to entertain you.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.998
Get real, Steve.
Why do you think l'm here?

07:21.176 --> 07:24.046
Charles, darling.

07:24.971 --> 07:27.675
Steve, what's wrong?

07:27.891 --> 07:29.800
Everything's fine.

07:30.018 --> 07:32.935
You look fabulous, Mom.

07:33.105 --> 07:37.683
Oh, it's good to see you.
lt's just like old times.

07:40.737 --> 07:42.776
The Hartley House was
where they had two teenagers

07:42.948 --> 07:44.608
and then one year,
they had a little baby.

07:44.783 --> 07:46.692
And next season,
he was suddenly 3 years old.

07:46.911 --> 07:50.908
And that little kid was Chuckie Wilson,
that's who Kelly's going out with.

07:51.415 --> 07:52.957
He's very adorable.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.239
l'm sure.

07:54.418 --> 07:56.291
Honey, you remember,
when the kids were little,

07:56.462 --> 07:58.585
l used to say Brandon
looked like little Chuckie.

07:58.798 --> 08:00.837
l did not.

08:01.050 --> 08:03.291
Come on, remember you had
that cute little cowlick?

08:03.469 --> 08:04.500
Can it, Bren.

08:04.679 --> 08:06.920
Anyway, is this guy really
as bad as Steve says he is?

08:07.140 --> 08:10.141
Well, l've known Steve and Chuckie
since elementary school.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.183
Just because they've wanted
to kill each other,

08:12.354 --> 08:14.180
doesn't mean l have to choose.

08:14.856 --> 08:16.433
Does it?

08:19.861 --> 08:22.233
Thanks, Mom. Dinner was great.

08:22.406 --> 08:25.988
Well, thank you for coming.
Now, you call me first thing tomorrow.

08:26.159 --> 08:28.650
- We have lots to talk about.
- Definitely.

08:28.871 --> 08:31.706
l'll give Kelly your regards,
okay, pal?

08:37.171 --> 08:41.667
l want an apology and an explanation
for your behaviour this evening.

08:41.884 --> 08:43.378
You were incredibly rude.

08:43.553 --> 08:45.794
l don't believe this.

08:47.098 --> 08:49.849
Nothing changes. Nothing!

08:50.059 --> 08:52.514
This is the way it's always been,
you're siding with him.

08:52.687 --> 08:54.264
This is business, Steve.

08:54.439 --> 08:58.519
The entire reunion show depends
on Charles agreeing to do it.

08:58.693 --> 09:00.566
How about putting me first
for a change?

09:01.655 --> 09:05.866
Steve, gorgeous,
you always come first with me.

09:06.076 --> 09:07.404
You know that.

09:07.619 --> 09:11.284
Why do you think l worked so much
when you were a little boy?

09:11.456 --> 09:15.868
l was a single mother.
l needed to support this family.

09:16.044 --> 09:17.752
Save me the sob story.

09:17.963 --> 09:20.121
You were the star
of the Hartley House.

09:20.299 --> 09:21.757
You loved every minute of it.

09:22.468 --> 09:24.591
Okay, fine.

09:24.762 --> 09:28.047
But do you know
what this reunion show means to us?

09:28.224 --> 09:29.338
Syndication, foreign.

09:29.517 --> 09:31.556
We're talking a lot of money here.

09:31.769 --> 09:33.808
Enough so you'll never
need to worry about college.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.056
- Dad's got that covered.
- Oh, please.

09:36.232 --> 09:38.271
Don't start depending
on his promises.

09:38.484 --> 09:41.520
You're my son
and l am looking out for your future.

09:41.738 --> 09:43.113
That's the way it's gonna be.

09:44.324 --> 09:46.067
l'm sorry.

09:47.202 --> 09:50.368
lt's just that Chuckie goes
out of his way to push my buttons.

09:50.539 --> 09:53.160
So don't let him.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.081
l know he can be difficult.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.212
But you were always
the one who was more mature.

09:59.423 --> 10:04.132
Please, tell him you're sorry.
Be nice to him.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.926
For both of us.

10:12.061 --> 10:14.386
Andrea, have l got a story for you.

10:14.605 --> 10:15.636
Entertainment Tonight says

10:15.815 --> 10:17.523
there may be
a Hartley House reunion show.

10:17.733 --> 10:19.275
With Chuck Wilson
going to school here,

10:19.443 --> 10:20.771
l think it's worth an interview.

10:20.945 --> 10:23.436
Griffin, The Blaze
doesn't run celebrity puff pieces.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.031
This isn't a puff piece.

10:25.241 --> 10:28.242
Child stars are a weird breed.
Don't you wanna know why?

10:28.453 --> 10:31.122
Chuck Wilson doesn't seem
particularly screwed up to me.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.407
He got thrown out
of his last three schools, Andrea.

10:33.583 --> 10:34.614
There's a story there.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.669
What do you wanna do? Turn this
paper into a supermarket tabloid?

10:37.838 --> 10:40.839
Come on, Brandon, lighten up.
This is a good story and you know it.

10:41.049 --> 10:44.382
l'll pull clips, l'll interview Chuck,
interview Steve Sanders.

10:44.553 --> 10:46.379
Whoa, how come
you wanna interview Steve?

10:46.597 --> 10:49.681
l wanna call the piece, ''The Two Sons
of Samantha Sanders.''

10:49.850 --> 10:52.175
You know,
the real family and the TV family.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.013
That could be good.

10:54.188 --> 10:55.896
Come on, Andrea,
Steve is a friend of ours.

10:56.065 --> 10:58.900
l don't want Geraldo here
dishing dirt on him.

10:59.068 --> 11:00.941
What? Me, dish?

11:01.946 --> 11:05.196
John, a piece like this
takes a little sensitivity.

11:05.366 --> 11:08.450
Not exactly his stock in trade,
no offence.

11:08.661 --> 11:11.330
lf you want this story so bad,
let me have it.

11:13.458 --> 11:18.120
Okay. But remember, be objective.

11:22.467 --> 11:24.424
- Chuck?
- Yes.

11:24.594 --> 11:25.839
l'm Brandon Walsh.

11:26.054 --> 11:28.295
Right, right.
Your sister's a friend of Kelly's, right?

11:28.515 --> 11:32.180
Right. l was wondering if l could
do a profile on you for The Blaze.

11:32.728 --> 11:33.759
Why me?

11:33.937 --> 11:35.597
You're a celebrity.

11:35.773 --> 11:37.267
Please, that was a long time ago.

11:37.483 --> 11:40.056
Yeah, well, l hear there's talk
of a Hartley House reunion.

11:40.235 --> 11:41.812
There's always talk.

11:41.987 --> 11:43.445
Well, still, l'm interested.

11:43.614 --> 11:45.737
You know,
what it's like to be a child star.

11:45.908 --> 11:48.149
You mean, why do all of us
end up in nut houses,

11:48.327 --> 11:49.607
jail cells or rehab centres?

11:50.121 --> 11:51.947
lt can't be an easy life.

11:52.123 --> 11:53.581
Actually, it can.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.709
So listen,

11:55.877 --> 11:59.376
l'll get my publicist to send over a bio,
my press pack and we'll talk.

11:59.547 --> 12:01.504
Right, l'll have my people
call your people.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.466
l'm sorry, l didn't mean to pull
a star trip on you.

12:05.678 --> 12:07.587
You wanna talk now?
l don't have class till 2.

12:07.764 --> 12:09.424
Sure.

12:09.975 --> 12:13.141
Samantha Sanders
was like a mom to me.

12:13.353 --> 12:15.144
l mean, she kept me in line

12:15.313 --> 12:19.227
and she taught me so much
about acting and the business.

12:19.401 --> 12:21.274
And she and Steve were like family.

12:22.321 --> 12:23.863
So you and Steve got along?

12:25.616 --> 12:27.276
We were like this:

12:27.493 --> 12:29.284
l loved him like a brother.

12:29.453 --> 12:30.484
Really?

12:30.663 --> 12:32.572
Excuse me,
l hope l'm not interrupting anything.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.782
No, actually,
l'm almost finished here.

12:34.959 --> 12:38.162
l was just telling Brandon--

12:38.337 --> 12:40.128
l was just telling Brandon
my life story.

12:40.339 --> 12:42.462
- You were a part of it.
- Unfortunately.

12:43.426 --> 12:46.427
Sibling rivalry.
lt affects even the best of families.

12:47.138 --> 12:48.798
Look, l came here to apologise.

12:49.724 --> 12:52.297
Oh, yeah,
for being such a jerk last night.

12:52.852 --> 12:54.429
Yeah, well, l'm sorry about that.

12:54.646 --> 12:56.354
That's okay,
you couldn't help yourself.

12:57.274 --> 13:00.393
Listen, l told my mother l'd apologise,
and l apologised.

13:00.569 --> 13:02.561
Let's leave it at that.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.941
You know, l was thinking it over
and l know what your problem is.

13:07.868 --> 13:10.572
- You're my problem, Chuckie.
- lnsecurity.

13:10.746 --> 13:15.040
That's what it is.
You're just one big open wound.

13:15.209 --> 13:17.118
What do l have
to be insecure about?

13:17.628 --> 13:21.162
Well, it's a known fact
adopted kids are insecure.

13:21.882 --> 13:24.123
- How the hell did you know that?
- Hey.

13:24.302 --> 13:28.169
l've known since we were 7.
Everybody knew, Steve.

13:28.389 --> 13:30.880
We were all supposed
to keep it quiet till Samantha told you.

13:31.059 --> 13:33.846
l guess she finally broke the news,
huh?

13:34.062 --> 13:37.431
l wonder what took her so long.
You know, Steve--

13:45.365 --> 13:46.693
Thanks a lot, Sanders.

13:46.908 --> 13:50.074
lf l get a shiner,
it'll look great on camera.

13:50.912 --> 13:54.031
Actually, there aren't gonna be
any cameras if l get busted.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.284
My heart bleeds for you.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.705
My parents say unless l keep
my nose clean, no more work.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.250
Poor baby.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.132
Well, l was thinking,

14:04.301 --> 14:06.174
it's sort of a waste
for both of us to do time,

14:06.345 --> 14:08.883
so why don't you
just take the rap for me?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.393
Eat it.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.891
l'd reconsider if l were you.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.396
Oh, yeah? Why would l do that?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.271
Because if you don't,

14:23.446 --> 14:25.734
l'm not gonna do
your mother's little reunion show.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.280
And frankly,
given the way her career's going,

14:28.493 --> 14:30.569
l think she needs it
a hell of a lot more than l do.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.910
What is this? Blackmail?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.623
Actually,

14:37.252 --> 14:38.912
yes.

14:46.971 --> 14:49.675
l don't understand. How come only you
got suspended? Why didn't he?

14:49.849 --> 14:51.343
- Because l hit him.
- He provoked it.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.892
lt was as much his fault as yours.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.602
l know that. l took the rap for him.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.471
- Why the hell did you do that?
- lt's a long story, Brandon.

14:58.649 --> 15:02.018
Steve, l've got the whole thing on tape.
We have to play this for the principal

15:02.236 --> 15:03.896
and he'll see
why you punched Chuckie out.

15:04.072 --> 15:05.732
Look, stay out of this, okay?

15:05.907 --> 15:07.317
Steve, it's not fair.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.157
Chuckie Wilson doesn't play fair,
okay?

15:09.327 --> 15:10.572
- He never did.
- Steve,

15:10.787 --> 15:12.613
if you get suspended,
you can't take finals.

15:12.831 --> 15:15.701
You're gonna get an incomplete
for the entire semester.

15:16.209 --> 15:19.293
Don't let him get away with this, man,
you got proof.

15:21.131 --> 15:22.411
Take care, Bran.

15:27.346 --> 15:30.715
lf the fever's not gone,
no school tomorrow.

15:30.891 --> 15:32.433
Now, hold this under your tongue.

15:32.601 --> 15:34.807
Okay, Mom.

15:44.071 --> 15:47.487
There's a steak in the fridge, just put it
in the broiler. l won't be back too late.

15:47.658 --> 15:49.366
Mom,
l told you l needed to talk to you.

15:49.577 --> 15:52.115
And l told you
this is not the best time, gorgeous.

15:52.288 --> 15:56.036
lt looks like the whole reunion show
is falling apart. Chuckie is wavering.

15:56.209 --> 15:58.878
Can we not talk about the reunion
or Chuckie for one minute?

15:59.045 --> 16:01.168
l need you now.

16:01.339 --> 16:04.008
l know l haven't been around much.
l'm sorry.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.420
As soon as this deal is closed,

16:05.594 --> 16:07.966
we'll spend some time together,
just you and me, l promise.

16:08.138 --> 16:12.087
Listen to me.
l got suspended from school today.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.592
What? You're telling me this now?

16:14.770 --> 16:16.809
Norman and all the junior agents
are waiting for me

16:16.980 --> 16:18.853
at Morton's
for a major strategy session.

16:19.024 --> 16:21.728
l'm sorry this doesn't fit
into your schedule.

16:21.902 --> 16:24.227
Okay, explain.

16:25.364 --> 16:27.237
What happened?

16:28.576 --> 16:30.699
l punched out
Chuckie Wilson today.

16:30.912 --> 16:33.782
Oh, my God. Well, no wonder
he's stalling on this deal.

16:33.956 --> 16:35.118
How could you do this to me?

16:35.291 --> 16:36.405
To you?

16:36.584 --> 16:40.202
Fighting with my co-star is not exactly
gonna get this show made, Steven.

16:40.421 --> 16:42.164
l'm sorry, but this--

16:42.340 --> 16:43.834
No buts.

16:44.676 --> 16:49.302
l was counting on you to help me.
l need this job, you know that.

16:49.848 --> 16:53.051
Fine. Go make your deals.

16:53.769 --> 16:55.595
By the way,
you've got nothing to worry about.

16:55.771 --> 16:58.688
Chuckie's gonna do the show.
l made sure of that.

16:58.857 --> 17:00.055
What do you mean?

17:01.026 --> 17:02.105
Ask him.

17:08.325 --> 17:10.696
l can't believe
Steve actually beat him up.

17:10.869 --> 17:12.364
What exactly
were they fighting about?

17:12.538 --> 17:14.530
l told Steve
Chuckie was taking me to the dance

17:14.707 --> 17:15.738
and he went ballistic.

17:15.915 --> 17:17.161
l mean, it was so embarrassing.

17:17.335 --> 17:19.790
l couldn't believe
he could be so immature.

17:19.962 --> 17:22.287
Maybe someday,
someone will fight over me.

17:22.464 --> 17:25.834
Like David Silver? l don't think so.

17:28.763 --> 17:30.921
This fight is perfect for the story.

17:31.099 --> 17:32.890
- lf we only had a picture.
- John--

17:33.059 --> 17:35.098
l'm not gonna let you
go soft here, Zuckerman.

17:35.270 --> 17:38.224
This is the kind of thing the kids
around here want to read about.

17:38.398 --> 17:39.512
Morning, all.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.066
l heard you were there, Brandon.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.143
Now, what did Sanders
and Wilson fight about?

17:43.320 --> 17:44.695
Give it a rest, John.

17:44.905 --> 17:47.574
Brandon, you were there. lt is news.

17:47.783 --> 17:50.024
No, it isn't, it's gossip
and l'm not interested.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.906
lf he doesn't wanna write it, l will.
There were other witnesses.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.823
- The public has a right to know.
- Wrong.

17:54.999 --> 17:58.000
There are things the public doesn't
have to know and this is one of them.

17:58.169 --> 17:59.248
Listen to him.

17:59.462 --> 18:02.747
He'll never make it on a college paper
with that attitude.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.220
l mean it, Andrea.
l'm not doing this story.

18:09.931 --> 18:12.600
Here are my notes.
Do what you think is best.

18:12.767 --> 18:13.798
Brandon.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.219
What was the fight about?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.189
lf Steve wants to tell you, fine.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.685
But l'm not gonna jeopardise
my friendship for a story.

18:27.991 --> 18:30.279
Mom, l have a question.

18:30.452 --> 18:33.618
And l bet l have the answer.

18:33.997 --> 18:36.285
Where did l come from?

18:36.458 --> 18:38.082
Well, sweetheart,

18:38.252 --> 18:41.418
your daddy and l
loved each other so much

18:41.589 --> 18:44.080
and one night,
there was so much love

18:44.258 --> 18:46.796
that it made a whole other person.

18:47.011 --> 18:48.719
And that person was you.

18:48.888 --> 18:50.002
Really?

18:50.222 --> 18:52.973
That's not
what Winfield Goulden says.

18:53.142 --> 18:56.427
He showed me pictures at recess.

18:57.939 --> 19:01.189
And where did little Winfield
say he came from?

19:01.359 --> 19:03.232
Cleveland.

19:04.696 --> 19:06.772
So, Mom, where did l come from?

19:06.948 --> 19:10.648
Chuckie,
you come from Philadelphia.

19:10.827 --> 19:12.736
l love you, Chuckie.

19:12.913 --> 19:14.870
l love you too.

19:20.212 --> 19:21.920
Mom, l have a question for you.

19:22.130 --> 19:25.546
And l bet l have an answer.
Ask away.

19:25.718 --> 19:26.880
Where did l come from?

19:27.052 --> 19:29.625
Oh, that's easy. Philadelphia.

19:30.264 --> 19:32.387
No, where did l really come from?

19:33.851 --> 19:37.136
l thought Winfield Goulden told you
everything you needed to know.

19:37.355 --> 19:39.063
l don't know that l believe him.

19:40.525 --> 19:43.194
Well, actually, it's very simple.

19:43.361 --> 19:47.821
An egg and a sperm get together
to create a zygote

19:47.991 --> 19:49.900
which grows into a foetus.

19:50.326 --> 19:53.611
Well, yeah,
but what about the love part?

19:53.788 --> 19:56.658
The part where you and Daddy loved
each other so much that one night,

19:56.833 --> 19:59.039
there was so much love,
it made a whole other person.

19:59.211 --> 20:00.621
And that person was me.

20:00.837 --> 20:03.541
That's how they got me, Steve-o.
Not you.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.632
Chuckie's right, gorgeous.
We went to the baby store for you.

20:08.846 --> 20:10.423
Too bad you're adopted, Steve-o.

20:10.597 --> 20:13.384
But you must have
a real mom somewhere.

20:13.934 --> 20:15.344
Don't you get it?

20:15.561 --> 20:16.759
Get what?

20:17.271 --> 20:19.512
You're an ornament around here.
Part of the set.

20:19.774 --> 20:21.351
But where did l come from?

20:21.567 --> 20:24.022
lf you really wanna know,
you'll go find your real parents.

20:24.236 --> 20:25.730
But how? Where?

20:26.322 --> 20:29.821
Oh, they're out there, somewhere.
Right, Mary Jo?

20:30.034 --> 20:32.904
Of course.
Everyone has a mother somewhere.

20:33.079 --> 20:35.652
Even in TV land.

20:56.562 --> 20:59.313
Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

20:59.481 --> 21:02.482
Good morning. You sound
awfully cheerful this morning.

21:02.651 --> 21:03.730
Care for some eggs?

21:03.903 --> 21:06.773
No, thanks, Jean.
Today, l start my diet.

21:06.947 --> 21:10.232
The camera adds 1 0 pounds
and l wanna be ready for it.

21:10.409 --> 21:12.816
Oh, today is one of those good days,

21:12.995 --> 21:16.079
the ones you wanna
remember and enjoy.

21:16.249 --> 21:17.363
Come on, gorgeous,

21:17.542 --> 21:20.377
give me one of those
million-dollar smiles.

21:21.087 --> 21:23.625
l don't have anything to smile about.

21:23.798 --> 21:25.790
Oh, you will.

21:26.384 --> 21:29.135
l have a surprise for you.

21:29.304 --> 21:30.632
What?

21:30.805 --> 21:33.212
lf l told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise.

21:33.391 --> 21:34.671
Come on.

21:34.851 --> 21:37.638
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

21:43.944 --> 21:46.648
- What's this?
- Well, it's your new car, silly.

21:46.864 --> 21:48.192
Now, do l get a smile?

21:48.365 --> 21:50.820
Or maybe just a good old-fashioned,
''Thanks, Mom.''

21:50.993 --> 21:52.570
What's this all about?

21:52.745 --> 21:53.907
You were right.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.321
Chuckie finally agreed
to do the reunion show

21:56.499 --> 21:58.657
and he said that you had
something to do with it.

21:58.876 --> 22:01.545
So thanks, gorgeous.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.793
l can't believe what l'm hearing.

22:03.965 --> 22:06.752
But then,
sensitivity never was your strong suit.

22:06.968 --> 22:08.960
lf it had been,
you would've told me l was adopted

22:09.137 --> 22:11.425
before you told Chuckie
and the rest of the world.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.222
What are you talking about?

22:13.433 --> 22:16.184
You didn't tell me
l was adopted till l was 1 6.

22:16.353 --> 22:18.061
Chuckie says he's known
since he was 7.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.643
- He says everybody's known.
- l didn't tell him, Steve.

22:20.857 --> 22:22.683
lf you didn't tell him, then who did?

22:22.901 --> 22:27.230
- l don't know. l swear, l don't know.
- At least now l know

22:27.406 --> 22:30.027
why l always felt like a second-class
citizen around that creep.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.908
He's not that bad, really.

22:32.119 --> 22:33.779
Are you listening
to what l'm saying here?

22:33.954 --> 22:35.863
He is that bad, he is.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.910
Do you know
why l got suspended from school?

22:39.502 --> 22:40.996
Because he wouldn't do
your lousy show

22:41.170 --> 22:43.791
unless l took the rap for the fight.

22:44.507 --> 22:47.377
And this, oh, this is my--
This is my commission, huh?

22:47.552 --> 22:50.718
- No, Steve, that's not true.
- lt is too.

22:50.930 --> 22:52.969
And l don't want this.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.510
You know,
maybe when you adopted me,

22:55.685 --> 22:58.520
you thought motherhood was
some role you could play. Well, it isn't.

22:58.688 --> 23:01.973
l'm real.
And l'm gonna find my real parents.

23:02.192 --> 23:04.398
Oh, my God.
ls that what this is all about?

23:04.569 --> 23:08.613
Steve.
l know l wasn't a perfect mother.

23:08.824 --> 23:13.201
But l did the best l could. l love you.

23:13.370 --> 23:15.528
For God's sake, l chose you.

23:28.469 --> 23:32.418
Oh, hello, Steve.
Shouldn't you be in school?

23:33.307 --> 23:35.050
Didn't they tell you
l got suspended?

23:37.729 --> 23:39.437
Come on in.

23:44.736 --> 23:46.194
Mrs. Walsh, you're a mother.

23:46.362 --> 23:48.817
Yes, yes, that l am.

23:48.990 --> 23:52.240
Well, l was wondering,
if Brenda and Brandon were adopted,

23:52.410 --> 23:56.242
hypothetically speaking,
if they were adopted,

23:56.790 --> 23:58.367
what would you think
if they came to you

23:58.542 --> 24:00.914
and told you they wanted to find
their real parents?

24:01.670 --> 24:04.042
Would you be hurt? Or mad?

24:04.631 --> 24:06.125
No. No, l don't think so.

24:06.300 --> 24:09.834
Not mad. Well, maybe a little bit.

24:10.012 --> 24:16.015
But l suppose what l'd feel
most of all would be

24:16.185 --> 24:17.513
afraid.

24:17.728 --> 24:19.186
Of what?

24:19.397 --> 24:24.142
Well, that if my children
found their natural parents, they'd--

24:24.318 --> 24:25.563
l'd lose them.

24:26.237 --> 24:28.313
Wouldn't you understand
that they had to know?

24:28.489 --> 24:30.197
That they had to know
where they came from?

24:30.366 --> 24:31.860
Steve,

24:32.827 --> 24:38.248
suppose the natural parents
don't wanna be found?

24:42.379 --> 24:45.582
Look, Donna,
l really hate to bring this up,

24:45.757 --> 24:49.624
but about the dance,
either my dad drives or you do,

24:49.803 --> 24:53.088
and l'd really rather it be you,
if that's okay.

24:53.682 --> 24:55.508
l don't see what she sees in him.

24:55.726 --> 24:57.434
Oh, come on, he's a good kid.

24:57.645 --> 24:59.768
Older women, younger guy couples
are big.

24:59.939 --> 25:02.227
Look at Cher.

25:02.441 --> 25:04.979
So l'll pick you up. ls 8 okay?

25:05.653 --> 25:08.191
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

25:09.991 --> 25:13.075
- l gotta go.
- Okay. Bye.

25:14.996 --> 25:16.490
Hi, guys.

25:16.664 --> 25:20.282
So, Donna, aren't you worried
about your reputation, you know?

25:20.502 --> 25:22.708
The stigma of going out
with a younger guy.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.747
l'm not going out with him, Dylan.

25:24.965 --> 25:27.253
Oh, no? You'd better be careful,
you might get arrested.

25:27.467 --> 25:30.302
Would you guys just cut it out?
David and l are just friends.

25:30.470 --> 25:34.135
You know, platonic friends.
So why don't you just stop?

25:35.392 --> 25:37.468
Kelly, can l talk to you for a second?

25:37.686 --> 25:40.011
- Sure.
- Alone.

25:40.189 --> 25:41.434
Yeah. l'll be right back.

25:41.607 --> 25:44.477
That's okay, l gotta run
to a meeting at the studio anyway.

25:44.693 --> 25:45.855
l'll see you tonight.

25:46.028 --> 25:48.316
- Bye.
- Bye, all.

25:49.657 --> 25:52.907
- He is adorable.
- No, he's not.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.494
l don't mean to step on you here,

25:54.662 --> 25:57.413
but l can't believe you're still going
to the dance with that loser

25:57.582 --> 25:59.455
after all that went down
between him and Steve.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.329
That's what you wanted
to talk to me about?

26:02.503 --> 26:06.203
You need to know the truth, Kelly.
l was there.

26:06.382 --> 26:08.707
Brandon, l didn't have to be there
to know what happened.

26:08.885 --> 26:09.916
Steve's jealous.

26:10.095 --> 26:12.502
He punched Chuckie out because
he's taking me to the dance.

26:12.681 --> 26:15.302
Wrong.
This had nothing to do with you.

26:15.517 --> 26:17.260
What do you mean?

26:18.770 --> 26:21.308
You know how sensitive Steve is
about being adopted.

26:21.523 --> 26:22.554
Yeah.

26:23.108 --> 26:24.483
Well, Chuckie knows.

26:24.985 --> 26:27.476
And he was giving Steve
a hard time about it.

26:27.655 --> 26:28.935
Poor Steve.

26:29.156 --> 26:30.354
He hates Chuckie.

26:30.532 --> 26:33.735
From the little l've seen of the guy
in action, l can't say l blame him.

26:33.911 --> 26:36.199
Well, what do you want me to do?

26:37.206 --> 26:38.404
l don't know.

26:39.083 --> 26:42.167
Just think about it, okay?

26:50.386 --> 26:54.134
Call me sentimental,
but l figured the old sound stage

26:54.307 --> 26:57.058
was the perfect place
to sign the deal memo.

26:57.227 --> 27:00.228
Well, l heard the producers kept
the set on mothballs all these years.

27:00.397 --> 27:03.647
Too bad you can't do the same thing
for the cast, huh?

27:06.194 --> 27:08.435
Serving champagne to a minor,
Norman?

27:08.655 --> 27:11.988
lt's only apple juice, Mom.
Pull up a glass.

27:12.743 --> 27:14.534
l was just telling Norman
how good he is.

27:14.703 --> 27:15.734
Yes, Norman.

27:15.913 --> 27:20.491
You are the best agent in town.

27:20.668 --> 27:21.948
l know.

27:23.587 --> 27:25.579
But you know
who should really be here?

27:25.756 --> 27:26.918
Steve.

27:27.091 --> 27:30.045
After all, he's the one
who finally got you to do the show.

27:30.219 --> 27:32.295
You're right. To Steve.

27:34.891 --> 27:38.425
What did he say exactly
that was so convincing?

27:38.603 --> 27:40.476
Oh, nothing specific.

27:40.647 --> 27:43.601
Steve's a great kid, Samantha.

27:44.109 --> 27:46.647
What happened
between the two of you anyway?

27:46.820 --> 27:49.026
You know how l hate
to see you fight.

27:49.239 --> 27:52.026
Well, you know Steve.
He's just Mr. Sensitive.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.951
Well, about some things.

27:55.454 --> 27:58.704
How did you know
that he was adopted, Charles?

28:01.835 --> 28:03.578
Everybody knew.

28:03.754 --> 28:07.668
No, as a matter of fact,
everybody didn't know.

28:07.883 --> 28:11.133
l told him, Sam, okay?

28:11.345 --> 28:12.590
A long time ago.

28:12.763 --> 28:15.717
You told him? Why?

28:15.892 --> 28:18.928
Well, you know how
the two of them were. Always fighting.

28:19.103 --> 28:20.182
They were little boys.

28:20.355 --> 28:23.521
One day,
Chuckie was jealous of Steve.

28:23.733 --> 28:25.310
l thought it would
make him feel better.

28:25.485 --> 28:30.610
You betrayed my trust so you could
make a little spoiled brat feel better?

28:30.782 --> 28:34.945
Hey, lady, it was this spoiled little brat
that kept you on the air.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.614
Besides, l did this for you.

28:36.830 --> 28:38.490
l know how important
this show is to you.

28:38.665 --> 28:40.408
Not more important than my son.

28:40.626 --> 28:43.377
- This is all just a misunderstanding.
- No.

28:43.587 --> 28:46.956
l understand
everything quite clearly.

28:47.132 --> 28:51.628
l've put up with this for far too long.
l've had enough.

28:52.263 --> 28:53.377
Where are you going?

28:53.556 --> 28:55.216
l'm not doing the show, Norman.

28:55.391 --> 28:56.968
You can't just back out now.

28:57.768 --> 28:59.594
- Oh, no?
- You made a deal!

29:00.271 --> 29:02.180
Watch me!

29:16.079 --> 29:17.277
Hey, kid.

29:18.623 --> 29:21.114
l don't wanna pry
but you've been here for two hours.

29:21.334 --> 29:22.744
How come you're not in school?

29:22.919 --> 29:24.496
lt's a long story.

29:24.713 --> 29:26.789
Yeah, must be.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.456
You don't look so hot.
ls everything okay?

29:29.635 --> 29:31.343
l'm fine.

29:32.262 --> 29:34.717
Hey, Nat, let me ask you a question.

29:35.599 --> 29:38.137
You look like your mom
or your father?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.351
My mother, l guess.

29:42.565 --> 29:44.225
How about you?

29:44.859 --> 29:47.100
That's the trouble, l don't know.

29:50.531 --> 29:51.811
Hey, man.

29:52.867 --> 29:55.784
Hey, listen,
cheer up this guy, will you, Dylan?

29:55.954 --> 29:58.623
He's on his third piece of pie
and nothing's working.

30:03.336 --> 30:04.878
Talk.

30:08.550 --> 30:11.005
l guess if anyone would understand,
it would be you.

30:11.636 --> 30:13.046
l'm listening.

30:18.727 --> 30:21.099
l never told you this, bro.

30:25.609 --> 30:27.186
l'm adopted.

30:32.116 --> 30:35.200
My whole life, l thought
l was Samantha Sanders' son.

30:36.454 --> 30:37.864
And suddenly, l wasn't.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.039
And, so?

30:43.044 --> 30:45.167
l wanna find my real parents.

30:45.338 --> 30:48.789
l wanna know who they are,
where they came from,

30:49.926 --> 30:51.336
why they gave me up.

30:51.553 --> 30:54.304
Are you sure
that's such a good idea, man?

30:55.056 --> 30:56.929
l've gotta know.

30:57.267 --> 31:01.430
Just because there's some woman out
there who is your biological mother,

31:01.605 --> 31:05.056
doesn't mean that you can find her
and have a relationship with her

31:05.234 --> 31:06.514
just because you want to.

31:07.027 --> 31:10.396
- l've been there.
- l know.

31:11.490 --> 31:14.574
So Samantha Sanders
didn't give birth to you.

31:14.743 --> 31:17.115
But, hey, man,
she's always been there for you.

31:19.665 --> 31:21.622
That's gotta count for something.

31:38.768 --> 31:40.262
Hello, gorgeous.

31:40.478 --> 31:42.020
Mom,
shouldn't you be at the studio?

31:42.731 --> 31:44.937
l'm not doing the show, Steve.

31:45.567 --> 31:47.109
What?

31:48.570 --> 31:52.864
l know what happened.
What Chuckie did to you.

31:53.659 --> 31:56.992
Baby, l'm so sorry.

31:57.204 --> 31:59.742
So very sorry.

32:00.624 --> 32:03.743
All those years, l made you be nice
to that little bastard.

32:04.795 --> 32:07.499
You don't have to be
nice to him anymore.

32:08.966 --> 32:10.164
l love you, Mom.

32:10.343 --> 32:11.588
l love you, baby.

32:15.932 --> 32:17.971
l know this may be hard,

32:18.768 --> 32:21.140
but l have to know
where l came from.

32:21.813 --> 32:23.223
What?

32:23.398 --> 32:25.141
My mother.

32:25.692 --> 32:27.815
Who's my real mother?

32:34.618 --> 32:38.200
l've dreaded this moment
for 1 7 years.

32:39.790 --> 32:43.372
lt's why l've waited so long
to tell you the truth.

32:44.712 --> 32:48.246
l'm scared, Steve.

32:50.801 --> 32:53.042
l just don't wanna lose you.

33:10.572 --> 33:14.190
Wow, David, how'd you get
this great parking spot?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.411
lt's one of the perks
of coming to the dance with me.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.496
Yeah.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.364
You're nervous, aren't you?

33:23.585 --> 33:24.865
No.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.583
What do l have
to be nervous about?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.131
Well, this is kind of a big deal.

33:29.299 --> 33:33.961
l mean, it's our first big social event
together.

33:34.138 --> 33:35.632
lt's just a dance.

33:36.140 --> 33:40.220
You mean, you don't feel weird at all
going out with me?

33:40.853 --> 33:43.344
Well, we're not going out.

33:46.067 --> 33:49.851
You mean, we came here together
but we're not really together.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.024
No, l didn't say that.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.446
You didn't have to.

33:54.617 --> 33:57.653
Come on, let's go inside
and get this over with.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.620
No, David, wait.

34:00.123 --> 34:04.500
Look, l'm proud
to be going to this dance

34:04.669 --> 34:06.792
with the best dancer
at West Beverly.

34:09.466 --> 34:10.545
Really?

34:11.134 --> 34:12.462
Yeah.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.721
Thanks.

34:19.101 --> 34:20.380
David.

34:20.561 --> 34:22.103
Oh, God, l'm sorry.

34:22.271 --> 34:26.219
l'm really sorry.
l don't know what got into me.

34:27.025 --> 34:28.817
lt's okay.

34:29.487 --> 34:31.063
Why don't we just go in, okay?

34:43.668 --> 34:45.328
Steve.

34:47.339 --> 34:48.536
l'm sorry.

34:49.132 --> 34:51.967
l know. l'm sorry too.

34:53.053 --> 34:55.626
l don't wanna hurt you,
but l gotta do this.

34:56.139 --> 34:57.681
l know.

35:00.686 --> 35:04.600
The only thing they told me
was your mother's name.

35:05.274 --> 35:06.554
Karen Brown.

35:07.860 --> 35:09.817
Karen Brown.

35:10.654 --> 35:13.109
My mother's name was Karen.

35:13.699 --> 35:16.403
l wish l could tell you more.

35:17.620 --> 35:20.739
All l know
is that she was very young.

35:21.708 --> 35:24.329
And she must have been
very beautiful.

35:25.962 --> 35:29.627
She came from a little town
somewhere outside of Albuquerque.

35:30.925 --> 35:33.131
That's where you were born.

35:33.845 --> 35:35.921
l've gotta go there.

35:36.807 --> 35:38.265
Where?

35:38.475 --> 35:40.218
To New Mexico.

35:41.770 --> 35:43.679
l've gotta do this.

35:44.815 --> 35:45.846
Now?

35:46.066 --> 35:47.346
Now. Tonight.

36:06.170 --> 36:07.664
There's a lot of people.

36:07.839 --> 36:10.045
l don't see Kelly.

36:11.634 --> 36:12.914
Well, there's Chuckie.

36:13.136 --> 36:15.424
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

36:30.904 --> 36:33.062
Kelly, what are you doing here?

36:33.240 --> 36:35.813
l thought you were going
to the dance with Chuckie.

36:35.993 --> 36:37.701
l stood him up.

36:37.870 --> 36:38.949
l heard what he did to you

36:39.121 --> 36:42.038
and this was the best way
l could think of to get even.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.623
Thanks, Kel.

36:44.794 --> 36:47.166
Do you wanna go for a drive?
lt's a nice night.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.500
Yeah, l do.

36:48.673 --> 36:51.045
Just let me
throw a few things together.

36:52.218 --> 36:54.625
God, l love California.

36:54.804 --> 36:56.298
Do you know
what some kids would give

36:56.472 --> 36:58.298
to drive around
with the top down in December?

36:58.474 --> 37:00.182
They'd buy tickets
to this kind of weather.

37:00.351 --> 37:02.842
Yeah. l guess we are pretty lucky.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.262
You know, l still don't believe
you're taking the bus.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.013
l mean, your mom just bought you
a brand-new Corvette.

37:08.235 --> 37:09.693
Well, hey, l'm going to a tiny town

37:09.861 --> 37:12.186
somewhere in the middle
of nowhere, New Mexico.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.033
l just think it'd be best
if l left Beverly Hills behind.

37:15.242 --> 37:18.575
Why don't you let me drive you?
l mean, you don't have to take the bus.

37:18.787 --> 37:22.535
Well, thanks, Kel, but that wouldn't
exactly be leaving things behind.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.659
l guess you're right.

37:26.003 --> 37:27.829
What time did you say
your bus leaves?

37:28.005 --> 37:29.914
Midnight.

37:30.091 --> 37:32.297
That gives us two hours.

37:32.510 --> 37:34.882
l know a few people
who'd like to say goodbye.

37:35.054 --> 37:36.168
Okay.

37:36.389 --> 37:37.966
Yeah? Good.

37:46.232 --> 37:48.141
l love Christmas.

37:48.318 --> 37:50.357
Yeah, especially Christmas break.

37:51.446 --> 37:52.644
And you know what?

37:52.822 --> 37:54.898
This Christmas,
you're gonna be spending it with us.

37:55.075 --> 37:57.363
Okay. But, Bren, you've gotta
promise me that your dad,

37:57.536 --> 37:59.196
he's not gonna
dress up like Santa Claus.

37:59.413 --> 38:02.449
That l can't promise.

38:07.921 --> 38:09.000
Hi, Brandon.

38:09.173 --> 38:11.212
Hey, Mr. Chapman.
Merry Christmas.

38:22.937 --> 38:26.436
Well, listen, Brandon,
you were right about the story.

38:26.607 --> 38:30.936
lt was gossip, pure and simple,
and l'm not running it.

38:31.154 --> 38:32.185
Good for you, Andrea.

38:32.363 --> 38:34.735
But leave business behind
for one night, huh?

38:38.119 --> 38:41.452
You wanna dance?

38:43.125 --> 38:45.331
You know l don't dance.

38:45.502 --> 38:48.123
Do you drink punch?

38:48.297 --> 38:49.874
Yeah, l do drink punch, definitely.

38:50.048 --> 38:52.040
Then start pouring.

39:12.613 --> 39:14.689
l don't think l should be here,
l'm suspended.

39:14.866 --> 39:18.400
Steve, when was the last time
you listened to some stupid rule?

39:25.794 --> 39:27.288
Would you look at that?

39:57.743 --> 39:59.285
Heigh-ho, Silver.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.835
- Now, that's what l call friendly.
- Yeah.

40:06.044 --> 40:07.953
lf that's her idea
of a platonic relationship,

40:08.171 --> 40:11.172
l would love to see what happens
when she decides to get physical.

40:16.763 --> 40:20.179
Yeah, wow. Okay?

40:24.605 --> 40:25.636
See, l like him.

40:25.814 --> 40:29.265
And if any of you have a problem
with that, that's too bad.

40:33.322 --> 40:34.982
lsn't that sweet?

40:35.157 --> 40:37.196
Yeah, it is.

40:43.124 --> 40:45.662
You stood me up.
l thought we had a date.

40:46.294 --> 40:48.582
l don't go out with people
who hurt my friends.

40:49.922 --> 40:52.839
Okay, have it your way.

40:53.676 --> 40:57.294
You'd better be careful.
Someone might think you like me.

40:57.472 --> 40:59.511
Let's dance.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.069
l hate to break this up, Steve.

41:20.287 --> 41:21.615
Mr. Chapman--

41:21.831 --> 41:24.748
l'm sorry, but l'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

41:24.959 --> 41:27.200
Come on, l'm already suspended.

41:27.378 --> 41:29.251
What, are you gonna expel me
from a dance?

41:29.463 --> 41:31.586
Come on, guys,
there's no need to make a scene.

41:31.799 --> 41:33.257
Yes, there is.

41:33.468 --> 41:35.377
l gotta catch a bus.

41:35.595 --> 41:37.303
Steve, wait, we'll all go with you.

41:37.472 --> 41:38.847
We will? Where?

41:39.057 --> 41:40.551
Taking buses now, Steve?

41:40.725 --> 41:42.717
What's the matter?
Mommy take away your wheels?

41:49.776 --> 41:51.934
- You know what you are, Wilson?
- No, big man.

41:52.112 --> 41:53.357
Why don't you tell me?

41:54.364 --> 41:55.988
You're a has-been.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.029
Faked him out.

42:18.473 --> 42:23.514
The overnight bus to Santa Clarita,
San Simeon and San Francisco

42:23.686 --> 42:26.307
is ready for boarding at Gate 4.

42:28.191 --> 42:30.729
l can't believe l never knew
Steve was adopted.

42:30.944 --> 42:32.901
Nobody knew except me and Kelly.

42:33.071 --> 42:34.944
l hope he's doing the right thing.

42:35.156 --> 42:37.029
He's doing what he's gotta do.

42:40.162 --> 42:41.241
Got my ticket.

42:41.455 --> 42:43.696
l hope they're round-trip tickets.

42:47.878 --> 42:50.036
The midnight Stratocruiser
to Flagstaff,

42:50.255 --> 42:54.087
Gallup, Albuquerque,
Tucumcari and Amarillo

42:54.260 --> 42:56.929
is ready for boarding at Gate 3.

42:57.972 --> 42:59.715
That's my ride.

43:00.725 --> 43:02.682
Good luck, pal.

43:07.065 --> 43:08.607
We love you, Steve.

43:09.233 --> 43:10.312
l love you, guys.

43:12.529 --> 43:15.530
