¶<i> It seems today</i>

00:04.488 --> 00:08.007

00:08.009 --> 00:11.369

00:11.370 --> 00:14.348

00:36.020 --> 00:39.281
Look at this, Brian.
Genderless baby announcement.

00:39.282 --> 00:41.041
"It's a they."

00:41.042 --> 00:42.450
Good for they.

00:42.451 --> 00:45.695
I'm getting my friend
a birthday card in Spanish.

00:45.696 --> 00:47.956
(laughing):
But he doesn't speak Spanish.

00:47.957 --> 00:50.217
(laughing loudly)

00:50.218 --> 00:53.244
Oh-ho-ho-ho, he's not gonna
know what it says.

00:53.245 --> 00:56.131
- Oh, you're bad.
- I know.

00:56.132 --> 00:58.725
I think I've earned whatever
misshapen Reese's product

00:58.726 --> 01:01.377
is by the cashier.

01:01.378 --> 01:03.921
Oh, my God, Brian, look--
a Fairuza Balk movie.

01:03.922 --> 01:06.066
- Huh, no way.
- Remember last week when I said,

01:06.067 --> 01:07.717
"I wonder whatever happened
to Fairuza Balk"?

01:07.718 --> 01:09.427
- I do.
- And now this.

01:09.428 --> 01:10.720
The world's crazy.

01:10.721 --> 01:12.388
This looks terrible.

01:12.389 --> 01:14.223
You need to get
out of here, Brian.

01:14.224 --> 01:16.392
The urine-soaked hairs
on the end of your penis

01:16.393 --> 01:18.895
are very off-putting
to the other customers.

01:18.896 --> 01:20.396
That's not urine, that's saliva.

01:20.397 --> 01:22.273
Go on, scoot, get out of here!

01:22.274 --> 01:24.776
Or I'll do the clichéd
pharmacy price check jokes.

01:24.777 --> 01:26.311
You wouldn't dare.

01:26.312 --> 01:29.589
(over P.A.): Yes, I need a price
check on extra-small condoms.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.284
WOMAN: (laughs) That's the
last thing he'd want announced.

01:33.285 --> 01:36.430
(laughing):
Oh, my...

01:36.431 --> 01:38.581
(both grunt)

01:38.582 --> 01:41.268
Can you believe he threw us out?
That's discrimination.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.628
It's just like what happened to
those blacks at that Starbucks.

01:43.629 --> 01:44.796
"Those blacks"?

01:44.797 --> 01:46.681
Discrimination
is a scourge, Stewie.

01:46.682 --> 01:48.275
It just makes me so angry.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.592
Well, then do
something about it.

01:49.593 --> 01:51.186
You know what?

01:51.187 --> 01:52.446
I will.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.448
I'm gonna throw
a rock at his window.

01:54.449 --> 01:56.524
Oh, hey, Karmann Ghia.
I like those.

01:56.525 --> 01:58.452
All right, here we go.

01:58.453 --> 02:00.695
(grunts)

02:00.696 --> 02:03.623
Thank you, Brian.
That was the last Munich gunman.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.149
You're a hero.

02:05.150 --> 02:06.109
A hero?

02:06.110 --> 02:08.610
I-I guess I am a hero.

02:08.612 --> 02:10.988
- Oh, nice! Wonderful!
- Great!

02:10.989 --> 02:12.323
- Way to go.
- Way to go, doggy!

02:12.324 --> 02:15.377
We are gonna throw you
the craziest party.

02:15.378 --> 02:18.880
Do we have a hot two-liter
of closet Pepsi?

02:18.881 --> 02:21.716
We do, and I can bring
Planters peanuts

02:21.717 --> 02:23.793
that were opened
a dozen years ago.

02:23.794 --> 02:27.130
Perfect. And I have
half a graduation cake

02:27.131 --> 02:28.890
we just have to let thaw.

02:28.891 --> 02:31.601
(to tune of "Hava Nagila"):
¶<i> Party, a Jewish party</i> ¶

02:31.602 --> 02:33.136
¶<i> With lots of old food</i> ¶

02:33.137 --> 02:35.905
¶<i> In a poorly lit room, oy!</i> ¶

02:40.569 --> 02:42.353
Oh, my God, Peter, look at this.

02:42.354 --> 02:44.981
She actually wore this
to an awards ceremony.

02:44.982 --> 02:47.834
Huh? Oh, yeah, crazy.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.170
(gasps) Unreal.
Peter, look, look.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.696
Peter, look, Peter.

02:51.697 --> 02:53.322
- (sighs)
- Flats.

02:53.323 --> 02:54.916
- Hmm?
- Flats!

02:54.917 --> 02:56.008
Mm.

02:57.494 --> 02:59.754
Look at this picture
of Shailene Woodley.

02:59.755 --> 03:02.516
She's so talented
and overrated and weird.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.926
I love her.
Isn't her haircut cute?

03:04.927 --> 03:06.594
Maybe I'll get my hair
cut short, too.

03:06.595 --> 03:08.212
Wha... N-No. No way.

03:08.213 --> 03:10.023
- I forbid it.
- (chuckles): What?

03:10.024 --> 03:12.267
- You can't forbid that.
- Yes, I can.

03:12.268 --> 03:14.694
That's the one thing men are
allowed to control about women.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.721
That and your uterus
and how much money you make

03:16.722 --> 03:17.923
and also everything else.

03:17.924 --> 03:20.057
- Peter, that's stupid.
- It's a fact, Lois.

03:20.058 --> 03:21.535
The only woman
that's ever looked good

03:21.536 --> 03:23.352
with short hair
is Halle Berry's boobs.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.729
Establishing shot.

03:24.730 --> 03:25.955
- Peter, you can't...
- Establishing shot!

03:29.785 --> 03:31.861
We're here with local hero
Brian Griffin,

03:31.862 --> 03:34.881
who recently foiled a robbery
at Goldman's Pharmacy,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.958
which by the way,
is getting its ass kicked

03:36.959 --> 03:38.626
by the CVS across the street.

03:38.627 --> 03:39.794
Welcome, Brian.

03:39.795 --> 03:41.913
So, what does it feel like
to be a hero?

03:41.914 --> 03:44.248
Well, let me say that
even though I am a hero,

03:44.249 --> 03:45.967
you don't have to call me one.

03:45.968 --> 03:48.303
I'm very comfortable
with "first responder"

03:48.304 --> 03:50.046
or, if you like, "veteran."

03:50.047 --> 03:51.398
So brave.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.758
How has this incident
changed your life?

03:53.759 --> 03:55.551
It hasn't.
I'm still the same

03:55.552 --> 03:57.678
humble public servant
I've always been.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.147
But there are perks.

03:59.148 --> 04:01.741
This morning, I was honored
by a local business.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.410
(crowd cheers)

04:03.411 --> 04:04.560
Thank you, Brian.

04:04.561 --> 04:06.604
And to show our appreciation,

04:06.605 --> 04:08.823
you get the first meal
at Quahog's

04:08.824 --> 04:10.733
newest Sizzler location!

04:10.734 --> 04:12.586
Oh. No.

04:12.587 --> 04:15.112
(chuckles):
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:15.113 --> 04:17.089
- No.
- That's fair.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.076
- Can you at least read
what's on this card?
- Sure.

04:20.077 --> 04:23.597
"Sizzler: the worst version
of your favorite meal."

04:23.598 --> 04:25.289
So, what's next for you, Brian?

04:25.290 --> 04:27.434
Well, I'll be at
Barnes & Noble this afternoon

04:27.435 --> 04:28.960
signing copies
of Deepak Chopra's

04:28.961 --> 04:31.295
<i>Seven Spiritual Laws
of Success.</i>

04:31.296 --> 04:34.549
Well, congratulations, Brian,
and thank you for your service.

04:34.550 --> 04:37.093
Coming up,
I get all anxious and weird

04:37.094 --> 04:40.280
when the new good-looking intern
brings me my coffee.

04:40.281 --> 04:43.474
And here's Jeremy
with my go-go juice.

04:43.475 --> 04:44.700
Ha-ha.

04:48.146 --> 04:49.697
- (phone dings)
- Man, my phone's been

04:49.698 --> 04:51.274
blowing up
since that interview.

04:51.275 --> 04:53.484
You should hear
some of my voice mails.

04:53.485 --> 04:54.869
<i>MAN:
Hello, Brian.</i>

04:54.870 --> 04:56.612
<i>This is Barack Obama,</i>

04:56.613 --> 04:59.156
<i>not the hobo
who lives at the wharf.</i>

04:59.157 --> 05:02.285
<i>Um, you did a good job and...</i>

05:02.286 --> 05:03.545
<i>I-I can't read that.</i>

05:03.546 --> 05:04.712
<i>BRIAN:
"I'm proud of you."</i>

05:04.713 --> 05:06.122
<i>MAN:
I'm proud of you.</i>

05:06.123 --> 05:07.623
<i>Thanks for the two dollars.</i>

05:07.624 --> 05:09.292
(gasps)
No way!

05:09.293 --> 05:10.644
Let's hear the next message.

05:10.645 --> 05:12.646
<i>MAN 2:
Hey, Brian, it's, uh...</i>

05:12.647 --> 05:13.796
<i>well, it's Shredder.</i>

05:13.797 --> 05:15.315
<i>Remember me?</i>

05:15.316 --> 05:17.508
<i>I know it's been a while,
but I saw you on TV</i>

05:17.509 --> 05:19.135
<i>and I'm just hoping
we could get together.</i>

05:19.136 --> 05:20.136
<i>I'd love to catch up.</i>

05:20.137 --> 05:22.155
<i>So, uh, uh, call me back.</i>

05:22.156 --> 05:24.566
- Oh, my God!
- "Shredder"?

05:24.567 --> 05:26.976
He sounds like a ski instructor
with a full beard

05:26.977 --> 05:29.829
who plays average guitar
and never texts me back.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.239
He's a dog I used to run with

05:31.240 --> 05:32.666
back when I was
living on the street.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.191
Haven't heard from him
in years.

05:34.192 --> 05:36.077
I'm actually surprised
he's still alive.

05:36.078 --> 05:38.505
He just drank all the time
and tried to get laid.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.582
Hard to be friends
with someone like that.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.675
Yes, it is.

05:41.676 --> 05:43.009
- You gonna see him?
- (phone dings)

05:43.010 --> 05:44.201
If I have time.

05:44.202 --> 05:45.536
Wow, The Rock!

05:45.537 --> 05:47.847
Boy, they're coming out
of the woodwork today.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.832
You're angling your phone
so I can't see it.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.076
"Dwayne Johnson."

05:51.077 --> 05:53.377
Only his friends know
that's his real name.

05:53.378 --> 05:55.688
- Still can't see it.
- I'll call him back later.

05:57.099 --> 05:59.191
Ow!

06:04.106 --> 06:06.891
Excuse me, sir, but this is
a private residence.

06:06.892 --> 06:08.702
Peter, it's me.

06:08.703 --> 06:10.945
I got my hair cut.
Isn't it fun?

06:10.946 --> 06:11.896
What?

06:11.897 --> 06:13.230
No, Lois, it's not fun.

06:13.231 --> 06:15.524
You look like Anne Hathaway
in <i> Les Misera...</i>

06:15.525 --> 06:18.569
Don't you ever compare me
to (bleep) Anne Hathaway.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.213
- Ever!
- You're right, you're right.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.740
I'm-I'm sorry.

06:22.741 --> 06:24.742
With my boobs and your hair,

06:24.743 --> 06:27.344
everybody's gonna think
we're a lesbian couple.

06:30.749 --> 06:32.249
Why'd he want
to meet in the park?

06:32.250 --> 06:34.894
We used to live here.
I'm assuming he still does.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.854
(helicopter blades whirring)

06:38.000 --> 06:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:48.266 --> 06:49.618
Brian, ha!

06:49.619 --> 06:51.435
So good to see you.

06:51.436 --> 06:53.321
Wha... Shredder?

06:53.322 --> 06:54.748
Is it really you?

06:54.749 --> 06:56.157
It's really me.

06:56.158 --> 06:58.442
I-I don't...
What is all this?

06:58.443 --> 07:00.736
(chuckles) Yeah, sorry about
meeting in the park.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.664
It's the only place
I can land this thing.

07:02.665 --> 07:03.998
Uh, Shredder,
I think you pinned

07:03.999 --> 07:06.117
Tom Cruise
under your helicopter.

07:06.118 --> 07:08.577
I was hanging on.
I do all my own stunts.

07:08.578 --> 07:10.004
I can't stop doing stunts.

07:10.005 --> 07:11.931
My whole life is a stunt.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.290
Yeah, yeah, we know.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.975
(grunting)

07:17.796 --> 07:19.797
Hey, you want to take
a personality test?

07:19.798 --> 07:21.590
Same answer as always:
no, thank you.

07:21.591 --> 07:22.800
I'm not gonna stop asking.

07:22.801 --> 07:24.185
- I know.
- Good to see you, Stewie.

07:24.186 --> 07:25.761
Good to see you,
Tiny Tom Cruise.

07:25.762 --> 07:27.447
- Thank you.
- He likes to have the last word.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.597
Be well!

07:28.598 --> 07:30.366
- See?
- Bye!

07:34.146 --> 07:36.038
¶ ¶

07:47.951 --> 07:50.211
Shredder, I-I can't get
my head around all this.

07:50.212 --> 07:52.997
Eh, it took me a while,
too, believe me.

07:52.998 --> 07:55.624
And I go by
George Townshend now.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.126
Oh, okay, George.

07:57.127 --> 07:59.003
George Townshend.

07:59.004 --> 08:01.672
- You-you want me to say both?
- I do.

08:01.673 --> 08:03.507
You know how Beyoncé
does the one-name thing?

08:03.508 --> 08:06.486
I do a two-name thing.
It's one more than Beyoncé.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.571
Why don't you take her name
out of your filthy whore mouth.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.159
Wow!
How'd you get all this?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.810
I worked my ass off.

08:14.811 --> 08:17.813
I'm a tech entrepreneur, I've
written 11 best-selling books,

08:17.814 --> 08:20.241
and I was the NBC executive
who suggested

08:20.242 --> 08:23.027
we assault the nation
with Chicago-themed programming.

08:23.028 --> 08:25.863
I hear they're working on
<i>Chicago Seinfeld.</i>

08:25.864 --> 08:28.866
What's the deal with
the South Side of this town?

08:28.867 --> 08:30.826
Don't say it, Kramer.

08:30.827 --> 08:33.537
¶ ¶

08:33.538 --> 08:35.222
(classical music playing)

08:38.018 --> 08:40.854
So, Brian, do you want to know
how I did all this?

08:40.855 --> 08:41.979
I really do.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.008
I got neutered.

08:46.009 --> 08:47.268
(inhales sharply through teeth)

08:47.269 --> 08:48.677
But why?

08:48.678 --> 08:50.605
Getting neutered
eliminated all distractions

08:50.606 --> 08:53.516
and allowed me
to focus solely on my work.

08:53.517 --> 08:56.519
Sometimes you have to
literally cut out the things

08:56.520 --> 08:58.145
that hold you back.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.873
Man, with no distractions,

08:59.874 --> 09:02.733
I could just spend all day
in here reading.

09:02.734 --> 09:06.254
I love that book <i> Charles Dickens</i>
by David Copperfield.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.797
Writing was his real magic.

09:12.244 --> 09:13.744
I just don't understand.

09:13.745 --> 09:15.555
One minute,
I got a hot ginger wife,

09:15.556 --> 09:17.465
and the next
I'm married to Ron Weasley.

09:17.466 --> 09:20.894
Donna wears a wig, so I've
never even seen her real hair.

09:20.895 --> 09:23.638
But I would imagine it looks
like an old, faded sweater

09:23.639 --> 09:25.732
that needs to be de-pilled.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.567
I haven't touched
Bonnie's hair in years.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.218
It's way high up there.

09:29.219 --> 09:30.928
Well, since Lois did
something to her appearance

09:30.929 --> 09:32.572
that you don't like,
you should do something

09:32.573 --> 09:34.723
to your appearance
that she doesn't like.

09:34.724 --> 09:37.652
Quagmire, that is pathetically
shallow and vindictive.

09:37.653 --> 09:39.103
I love it!

09:39.104 --> 09:40.914
I'm gonna make myself
harder to ignore

09:40.915 --> 09:43.232
than an amateur photographer.

09:43.233 --> 09:44.309
Okay, this is hilarious.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.734
So I'm sitting
in my office at work

09:45.735 --> 09:47.253
when the fire alarm goes off...

09:47.254 --> 09:48.329
(shutter clicks)

09:48.330 --> 09:49.738
Um, what-what,
what was I saying?

09:49.739 --> 09:50.982
Fire alarm.

09:50.983 --> 09:52.575
Right, right, right, okay.
This is so funny.

09:52.576 --> 09:54.093
So, the fire alarm goes off...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.452
(shutter clicks)

09:55.453 --> 09:56.838
Hey, hey, friend?

09:56.839 --> 09:58.264
Friend? Friend?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.125
Can-can you just...
n-not-not right now?

10:01.126 --> 10:02.268
Now, where was I?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.771
- Fire alarm at work.
- Oh, right.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.514
You know what?
Just forget it.

10:06.515 --> 10:08.649
The punch line is it was 9/11.

10:10.635 --> 10:12.861
Well, yeah, it's not funny <i> now.</i>

10:16.784 --> 10:18.192
Scoot over, Stewie.

10:18.193 --> 10:20.361
George Townshend was wrong,
and I'm gonna prove it.

10:20.362 --> 10:22.438
I don't need to get neutered
to be productive.

10:22.439 --> 10:24.607
I'm gonna write
an inspirational book

10:24.608 --> 10:26.275
about my life,
and I'm calling it

10:26.276 --> 10:27.818
<i>The Holy Bri-ble.</i>

10:27.819 --> 10:30.296
- Please don't.
- Here we go, blank page.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.756
- (knuckles crack)
- World of possibilities.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.635
And you're watching porn.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.044
Oh, my God!

10:37.045 --> 10:39.622
Two clicks and I instinctually
went right to porn.

10:39.623 --> 10:41.457
Maybe George Townshend
was right.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.125
Maybe I am easily distracted.

10:43.126 --> 10:44.644
Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.312
It's okay to be
easily distracted.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.147
That's what's
saved Warren Beatty

10:48.148 --> 10:49.982
and Annette Bening's marriage.

10:51.727 --> 10:54.303
Annette, let's have sex.

10:54.304 --> 10:57.156
Or you could watch <i> Blue Bloods</i>

10:57.157 --> 10:59.141
and have a pudding cup.

10:59.142 --> 11:00.951
Hmm?

11:03.480 --> 11:06.331
Mmm.
Go get 'em,<i> Blue Bloods.</i>

11:10.671 --> 11:12.246
Good evening, Lois.

11:12.247 --> 11:14.698
Oh, my God, Peter,
what the hell are you wearing?

11:14.699 --> 11:15.866
Jeans.

11:15.867 --> 11:18.419
Just jeans. You like it?

11:18.420 --> 11:21.514
No. You look like you're going
to a custody hearing in Florida.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.706
Oh, really?

11:22.707 --> 11:24.759
Because I think
it's a "fun" look.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.019
Just like your hair.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.262
Okay, I see what you're doing.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.881
Good. So we agree
that your haircut is stupid.

11:30.882 --> 11:33.434
What? No.
I love my haircut.

11:33.435 --> 11:35.052
Then I love this look.

11:35.053 --> 11:37.196
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna add

11:37.197 --> 11:39.941
this free Fandango golf visor
I got

11:39.942 --> 11:42.059
when I snuck in to see
<i>I Feel Pretty.</i>

11:42.060 --> 11:43.519
(groans)
Fine.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.280
You want a war, Peter?
Let's go to war.

11:46.281 --> 11:47.564
Let's do it.

11:47.565 --> 11:48.783
(gavel bangs)

11:48.784 --> 11:51.235
Tallahassee Family Court
calls Peter Griffin.

11:51.236 --> 11:52.378
Here, Your Honor.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.072
Ho-ho, look who's
all dressed up.

11:55.073 --> 11:57.633
I just want Skylar back!

12:03.540 --> 12:05.040
Tesla, Apple, SpaceX,

12:05.041 --> 12:08.585
Kendrick Lamar,
drone technology, Hemingway.

12:08.586 --> 12:12.065
Wow. That was the coolest
phone call I've ever heard.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.215
My life is pretty cool.

12:13.216 --> 12:15.926
Brian, walk with me.

12:15.927 --> 12:18.071
You know, I wish I could spend
more time with you today,

12:18.072 --> 12:20.406
but I'm late for
a video conference with

12:20.407 --> 12:23.200
(Spanish accent):
Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.895
Listen, I need to talk
to you about something.

12:26.896 --> 12:29.156
I was thinking about what
you said the other day, and...

12:29.157 --> 12:31.608
- I think you might be right.
- About what?

12:31.609 --> 12:34.087
I've always believed I was
destined for a life like yours,

12:34.088 --> 12:36.071
but something was
holding me back,

12:36.072 --> 12:39.091
and now I realize
it was two things.

12:40.335 --> 12:42.786
- My balls are the things...
- No, I got it.

12:42.787 --> 12:45.305
George Townshend,
I want to get neutered.

12:46.958 --> 12:48.625
I'm proud of you, buddy.

12:48.626 --> 12:49.844
It's gonna be great.

12:49.845 --> 12:51.795
I'll finally be able
to beat that guy

12:51.796 --> 12:53.939
who fights dirty
in my karate class.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.444
Surprise.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.779
Now take this.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.138
Hiy...

13:01.139 --> 13:03.282
(exclaiming)
You can't use a sword!

13:03.283 --> 13:04.975
Sensei Dan, he's using a sword!

13:04.976 --> 13:06.910
No swords, guys.

13:14.152 --> 13:16.871
Brian, are you sure
about getting neutered?

13:16.872 --> 13:19.656
I am. You've seen everything
George Townshend's accomplished.

13:19.657 --> 13:21.408
That's the life
I've always dreamed of.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.827
Yes, but how much
do you really know about him?

13:23.828 --> 13:26.163
- Have you read his books?
- Of course I've read his books.

13:26.164 --> 13:27.715
They changed my life.

13:27.716 --> 13:29.625
Look, Stewie,
this is a huge step for me,

13:29.626 --> 13:31.293
and if you can't support me,

13:31.294 --> 13:33.854
well, then maybe I should
cut you out of my life, too.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.649
Brian, that's a closet.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.650
I know. I have stuff
to do in here.

13:40.896 --> 13:42.362
(door creaks)

13:47.903 --> 13:50.104
(door creaks)

13:50.105 --> 13:52.022
Well, nothing left to do
but binge-watch

13:52.023 --> 13:54.691
- Ken Burns'<i> History of Jazz.</i>
- What?

13:54.692 --> 13:57.578
<i>KEITH DAVID (on TV):</i>
<i>The rhythmic drums</i>
<i>of the Congo.</i>

13:57.579 --> 14:01.323
<i>-300 years later,</i>
<i>Charlie Bird Parker.</i>
<i>-(jazz music playing)</i>

14:01.324 --> 14:03.176
<i>But how did we get there?</i>

14:03.177 --> 14:05.427
(Brian groans)

14:08.498 --> 14:10.332
(busy chatter)

14:10.333 --> 14:12.376
Lois, what are you doing here?

14:12.377 --> 14:14.837
Did someone die?
Do I get to go home early?

14:14.838 --> 14:18.173
Well, Peter, since you were
having that jeans fun,

14:18.174 --> 14:20.601
I thought it might be fun
to come by and sell

14:20.602 --> 14:23.938
some of my homemade jewelry
to your coworkers during lunch.

14:23.939 --> 14:26.273
What?
Lois, you can't do that.

14:26.274 --> 14:28.367
Once a guy's wife sells
something in the break room,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.036
no one ever
looks at him the same.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.038
Two years ago,
Bentley's wife made him hang

14:32.039 --> 14:34.398
a sign-up sheet
to sponsor her in an AIDS walk,

14:34.399 --> 14:35.899
and we've hated him ever since.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.401
Don't look at me, Bentley.

14:37.402 --> 14:38.402
(glass shatters)

14:38.403 --> 14:39.954
Well, Peter,
all you have to do

14:39.955 --> 14:42.030
is say you like my haircut,
and I'll leave.

14:42.031 --> 14:44.125
- Never.
- Suit yourself.

14:44.126 --> 14:47.128
Everyone,
I'm Peter Griffin's wife.

14:47.129 --> 14:49.371
I took a jewelry-making class
last month

14:49.372 --> 14:51.373
with a group of preschool moms,

14:51.374 --> 14:54.226
and now I'm gonna
do it as a career.

15:01.426 --> 15:03.760
Hey, you want
a half of my sandwich?

15:03.761 --> 15:05.738
Oh. Yeah.
Very cool, Bentley.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.931
- Who made this?
- My wife.

15:07.932 --> 15:10.576
- Oh, y-your wife with AIDS?
- She doesn't have AIDS.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.820
She did a walk
for people <i> with</i> AIDS.

15:12.821 --> 15:15.656
But presumably there were people
who had AIDS at the walk?

15:15.657 --> 15:17.107
Yeah, but you can't get...

15:17.108 --> 15:19.126
Yeah, it's a no
on the sandwich, Bentley.

15:22.664 --> 15:24.206
Greetings, Lois.

15:24.207 --> 15:26.333
Oh, my God, Peter,
you're gonna make me vomit.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.243
I'm just getting in some 'cize.

15:28.244 --> 15:31.096
That's what I call
exercise now: 'Cize.

15:32.674 --> 15:34.675
(retches)

15:34.676 --> 15:36.602
Oh, God, Peter,
please put that thing

15:36.603 --> 15:38.253
in the garage
and change your clothes.

15:38.254 --> 15:39.588
Oh, I'd be happy to, Lois.

15:39.589 --> 15:41.274
But I'm not doing it
because you said.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.258
I'm doing it because of
the mean seventh graders

15:43.259 --> 15:45.427
who have been chucking
footballs at me all day.

15:45.428 --> 15:48.597
BOY:
There he is!
Let's get that fat dork!

15:48.598 --> 15:50.524
I'm home! Home is safe!

15:50.525 --> 15:53.160
(grunts)
Home is safe!

15:58.792 --> 16:01.961
I see you found all of
George Townshend's books.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.278
That was fast.

16:03.279 --> 16:05.239
Yep, got my own system.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.466
I call it
"The Stewie Decimal System."

16:07.467 --> 16:09.493
(laughs)

16:09.494 --> 16:13.288
Oh, Stewie, you're gonna make me
spit out my saltwater taffy.

16:13.289 --> 16:15.140
(laughing)

16:16.143 --> 16:17.668
Oh, my God!

16:17.669 --> 16:19.836
Brian's in trouble!

16:19.837 --> 16:23.149
Stewie, I've got to have you
around here more often.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.276
Oh, I think you'll
find me here... periodically.

16:27.637 --> 16:30.405
There's homeless sperm on this.

16:37.739 --> 16:39.690
- Where are the glasses?
- I moved them.

16:39.691 --> 16:40.983
What? Why?

16:40.984 --> 16:42.168
I moved everything.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.503
All the glasses,
the bowls, the plates.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.364
Nothing is where it's been
for the past 17 years.

16:47.365 --> 16:48.381
Nothing.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.511
I'm gonna become a deejay.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.256
I'm going to hire a life coach.

16:55.257 --> 16:57.374
I'm gonna make
one political donation

16:57.375 --> 17:00.335
with your e-mail address
so you'll be screwed for life.

17:00.336 --> 17:03.338
I'm going to rededicate
my life to Christ.

17:03.339 --> 17:04.714
Oh, that's really bad.

17:04.715 --> 17:07.050
I'm gonna start a podcast
that has no focus

17:07.050 --> 17:09.435
and it'll take up
an inordinate amount of time.

17:09.436 --> 17:12.365
I'm going to constantly complain
about my fibromyalgia.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.867
- You don't have fibromyalgia.
- No one does!

17:14.867 --> 17:17.853
Every time a waiter tells me
their name, I'm gonna use it.

17:17.854 --> 17:21.540
I'm gonna get really into
Halloween, like, really into it!

17:21.540 --> 17:23.876
Gross. I'm gonna
wear a denim shirt

17:23.877 --> 17:25.902
with the Looney Tunes guys
embroidered on it

17:25.903 --> 17:27.753
to church every Sunday.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.074
(both moaning)

17:31.075 --> 17:33.385
Oh, Peter. Oh, Peter.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.209
So, what do you think
of my haircut now?

17:41.210 --> 17:43.228
It's ugly.
I hate it.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.070
- How you feeling, buddy?
- Good.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.314
Nervous but strangely excited.

17:53.315 --> 17:55.599
I haven't been
totally honest with you.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.076
I was never neutered.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.652
But you're about to be.

17:58.653 --> 18:00.079
What?
No!

18:00.080 --> 18:01.897
Save me, Sensei Dan!

18:01.898 --> 18:04.833
- No neutering, guys.
- (grunting)

18:08.422 --> 18:10.297
¶ ¶

18:11.591 --> 18:12.741
Why are you doing this?

18:12.742 --> 18:14.427
What did I do to you
that was so bad?

18:14.428 --> 18:16.003
You abandoned me.

18:16.004 --> 18:18.246
You promised we'd be there
for each other forever.

18:18.247 --> 18:20.174
Then the minute
Peter Griffin came along,

18:20.175 --> 18:21.934
you just got in his car
and left me.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.345
I was gonna come back
and get you, and-and then,

18:24.346 --> 18:26.680
and then Trump happened
and-and all that...

18:26.681 --> 18:28.015
Liar!

18:28.016 --> 18:29.966
I've wanted to cut
your balls off for years,

18:29.967 --> 18:32.353
but the fact that you're
choosing to do it yourself

18:32.354 --> 18:34.262
is so much more satisfying.

18:34.263 --> 18:36.357
But I'm not choosing
to do it myself.

18:36.358 --> 18:37.933
- I love my balls.
- (gas hissing)

18:37.934 --> 18:39.826
They smell awful.

18:50.446 --> 18:51.338
(gasps)

18:52.448 --> 18:53.465
(shouts)

18:54.659 --> 18:56.284
Stay back!

18:56.285 --> 18:59.663
Stewie.
Y-You saved me.

18:59.664 --> 19:01.331
Oh.

19:01.332 --> 19:03.625
- Well, almost.
- What is it?

19:03.626 --> 19:05.478
Oh, my God, they got one!

19:05.479 --> 19:07.480
Or you still have one.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.815
Maybe you should be
a scrotum half-full guy.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.558
How did you know
what he was doing?

19:11.559 --> 19:13.677
I read his book.

19:13.678 --> 19:15.637
"There is no greater motivation

19:15.638 --> 19:17.764
"than the destruction
of an enemy,

19:17.765 --> 19:20.401
"and my enemy is Brian Griffin.

19:20.402 --> 19:23.570
"One day, I will convince him
to cut off his own balls,

19:23.571 --> 19:26.314
and that will be
my greatest accomplishment."

19:26.315 --> 19:28.483
You said his books
changed your life,

19:28.484 --> 19:30.169
but you didn't even read them.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.320
This is why you're nothing.

19:32.321 --> 19:34.156
I'm sorry, okay?

19:34.157 --> 19:35.249
Yes, I abandoned you.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.200
And I didn't go back
to find you.

19:37.201 --> 19:38.994
I'm a bad friend, I admit it.

19:38.995 --> 19:41.514
But did you ever think
that you should be thanking me?

19:41.515 --> 19:43.540
Thanking you?
For what?

19:43.541 --> 19:45.184
For everything you have.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.521
Your hatred for me is what
motivated you your whole life.

19:48.522 --> 19:51.098
Without me, none of this
would've been possible.

19:51.099 --> 19:52.399
I made you.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.694
You've already got
one of my balls.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.937
Isn't that enough?

19:56.938 --> 19:58.864
You know what, Brian?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.724
It is enough.

20:00.725 --> 20:02.943
You'll probably keep it
in a trophy case or something.

20:02.944 --> 20:04.895
Oh, no.
I ate it already.

20:04.896 --> 20:06.563
Dogs are gross.

20:06.564 --> 20:08.289
(helicopter blades whirring)

20:10.118 --> 20:12.545
Thank you, Stewie.
You really saved me.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.547
My pleasure, Brian.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.957
Well, the good news is
we can give you a prosthetic.

20:16.958 --> 20:18.575
The bad news is

20:18.576 --> 20:21.720
it's one of the bells
from a jester's hat.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.222
There's no brain activity,

20:23.223 --> 20:25.391
so we're gonna
harvest his bells.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.967
- We understand.
- (bells jingling)

20:26.968 --> 20:28.394
Why did the king

20:28.395 --> 20:31.312
have to hit him so hard?!

20:38.480 --> 20:41.765
So, anyone want to ask me
about my week?

20:41.766 --> 20:44.617
Kind of a big week
for the Megster.

20:45.987 --> 20:48.605
Big envelope in the mail.

20:48.606 --> 20:51.399
Yep, early admittance.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.777
Day one, August 26,
clean slate.

20:53.778 --> 20:55.111
Closing credits.

20:55.112 --> 20:57.498
JOE (outside):
Congratulations on Bowdoin, Meg!

20:57.499 --> 21:00.283
- Closing credits!
- Oh, we're done?

21:00.284 --> 21:02.218
