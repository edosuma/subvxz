-Woo-hoo!
-Aaah!

00:36.400 --> 00:40.160
We've got to be in tip-top shape
for our big race!

00:40.360 --> 00:44.000
Actually, I was thinking
maybe we'd skip it this year.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.919
Skip it? But this year
it's a bicycle race

00:47.120 --> 00:51.839
in the most famous bicycle
racing country ever, France!

00:52.120 --> 00:55.680
Yes, but every time we race,
stuff always goes wrong,

00:55.839 --> 00:56.800
and we lose.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.160
Remember last year?

00:58.360 --> 00:59.879
-We crashed!
-Yeah!

01:00.040 --> 01:03.279
Into an ice-cream shop
and had the best snack ever!

01:03.519 --> 01:08.200
Racing isn't just about winning,
Ollie. It's about having fun!

01:08.360 --> 01:12.080
Maybe for you,
but I want to win a big trophy!

01:12.360 --> 01:13.679
[computer noises]

<i>-Hi, Ollie! Hi, Moon!</i>
-Hi, Dolly! Hi, Zoom!

<i>Yeah, you two always push us</i>
<i>to be our number-one best!</i>

01:30.280 --> 01:33.640
Yes, well, unfortunately,
we won't be racing this year--

01:33.800 --> 01:35.560
Because we'll be
too busy winning!

01:35.759 --> 01:37.320
We wouldn't miss it
for the world!

01:37.440 --> 01:41.920
<i>Goody! Well, we'll see you</i>
<i>in France, bestest race buddies!</i>

01:42.080 --> 01:43.560
<i>-Baa-bye!</i>
-Yay!

01:43.720 --> 01:46.160
Moon, you told them
we're racing!

01:46.320 --> 01:47.559
Because we are!

01:48.080 --> 01:51.440
But we'll never win a big trophy
racing against <i>those </i>sheep.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.360
Not if we don't try!

01:53.479 --> 01:56.440
Think positive, Ollie!

01:56.839 --> 02:01.160
Hmm. There's got to be some way
to get you in the mood to race.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.640
[gasps]
I'm having a brainstorm.

02:03.919 --> 02:05.759
-You're having a brainstorm?
-Ollie,

02:05.919 --> 02:09.440
France isn't just the land
of amazing bicycle racing,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.720
it's also the land
of amazing cheese!

02:12.880 --> 02:15.200
Ah! Cheese?

02:15.560 --> 02:20.880
The gooiest, chewiest,
creamy-dreamiest cheese ever!

02:21.040 --> 02:23.160
But if you'd rather
skip the race...

02:23.320 --> 02:24.880
Ready! Let's go!

02:25.040 --> 02:26.680
The race is on!

02:34.160 --> 02:35.200
Whoo!

02:36.000 --> 02:37.440
Whee!

02:44.359 --> 02:47.440
Yoo-hoo! See you at the hotel!

02:47.600 --> 02:50.079
What?
The race hasn't even started

02:50.239 --> 02:52.359
and those sheep
are already winning!

02:52.519 --> 02:56.600
<i>We are now arriving</i>
<i>in Loire Valley, France!</i>

02:59.000 --> 03:02.560
Welcome to our beautiful,
cosy hotel, Ollie!

03:02.920 --> 03:07.440
I hope we get a big room
with super-fluffy beds...

03:08.079 --> 03:09.799
And a huge bathtub.

03:10.359 --> 03:11.760
Yoo-hoo!

03:12.040 --> 03:14.000
This place is amazing!

03:14.160 --> 03:15.440
We got the last room,

03:15.600 --> 03:19.200
with super-fluffy beds
and a huge bathtub.

03:19.359 --> 03:22.519
Time for a bubble bath.
Race ya tomorrow!

03:22.679 --> 03:25.920
-See? They always win.
-Leave it to me.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.920
See? We win too!

03:30.079 --> 03:32.200
The hotel gave us
a picnic dinner

03:32.359 --> 03:35.920
<i>and </i>we get to sleep
in a charming, private...

03:37.079 --> 03:40.320
-Barn?
-Moo!

03:40.720 --> 03:43.480
That may be warm and cosy
for a cow,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.600
but I was kinda hoping
for a bed!

03:45.760 --> 03:47.119
I think it's awesome!

03:47.239 --> 03:50.200
Instead of staying in a regular,
old hotel,

03:50.320 --> 03:53.440
we get to sleep
in a way-cool barn!

03:53.600 --> 03:55.119
[sighs]

03:55.280 --> 03:56.840
You make up our hay beds, Ollie,

03:57.040 --> 03:59.280
and I'll unpack
our picnic dinner.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.799
Hello... Adeline.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.440
Could you please, moo-ve?

04:05.600 --> 04:07.079
Moo!

04:08.959 --> 04:11.839
Mmm. Fresh French baguettes...

04:12.000 --> 04:14.839
Ooh! Onion soup and...

04:16.560 --> 04:18.519
macaroons for dessert!

04:22.280 --> 04:24.440
That was mine!

04:24.599 --> 04:26.719
-And so was that!
-Moo!

04:26.880 --> 04:30.039
That was nice of you to share
our dinner with Adeline.

04:30.159 --> 04:31.920
Guess I'm finished with dinner.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.560
And now we can get to bed early
and be super well rested

04:35.719 --> 04:37.000
for the race tomorrow.

04:37.159 --> 04:38.360
'Night, Ollie!

04:38.520 --> 04:40.760

04:52.120 --> 04:53.840

04:55.599 --> 04:57.479
-Moo!
-Aaah!

04:57.719 --> 05:00.560
C'mon, Ollie! Time to race!

05:04.719 --> 05:05.960
I can't believe it!

05:06.200 --> 05:08.880
Somebody beat us
to our favourite numbers,

05:09.039 --> 05:11.240
so I picked
new favourite numbers!

05:11.400 --> 05:13.440
No, I like
our old numbers better.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.840
[gasps] Maybe we can trade!
Who got our favourites?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.840
Ollie! Moon! You made it!

05:20.039 --> 05:21.360
Yay!

05:21.520 --> 05:23.800
You got
our favourite race numbers!

05:23.960 --> 05:27.200
Really?
These are our favourites too!

05:27.320 --> 05:30.200
We were fated to be friends.
Baa!

05:30.359 --> 05:33.200
-See ya at the starting line!
-Baa-bye!

05:35.680 --> 05:38.320
Ready to ride and win
that trophy, Ollie?

05:38.479 --> 05:40.680
As soon as I do my safety check.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.039
Tool kit, check.
Rear-view mirror, check.

05:43.359 --> 05:46.680
Emergency brake, water bottle,
helmets, check.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.880
Horn, check.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.120
And Moon! Check!

05:51.840 --> 05:53.880
We're off to the races!

05:54.280 --> 05:56.120

06:09.840 --> 06:11.479
Baa!

06:13.039 --> 06:16.640
I don't... understand.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.159
The faster I pedal,
the slower we go.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.880
Because you're going too fast!

06:23.039 --> 06:27.280
-I'm braking for safety!
-Ollie, little brainstorm here.

06:27.479 --> 06:29.640
What if I pedal
and you read the map?

06:29.799 --> 06:31.719
Or maybe we should
just forget the race

06:31.880 --> 06:33.520
and enjoy some French cheese?

06:33.680 --> 06:36.520
Race now, cheese later!

06:52.120 --> 06:54.039
Huh? Hold on!

06:54.159 --> 06:56.599
Castles? Bridges?

06:56.760 --> 06:58.520
These aren't on the race course.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.719
We definitely took a wrong turn.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.000
But what an amazing view!

07:03.159 --> 07:05.039
Yeah, but it's the wrong view!

07:05.240 --> 07:07.960
-We're at a castle.
-You mean, <i>chââteau.</i>

07:08.120 --> 07:11.320
That's the French word
for a grand house like this.

07:11.479 --> 07:15.520
OK, we're not supposed to be
going past a <i>chââteau.</i>

07:15.680 --> 07:17.440
Whoa!

07:18.440 --> 07:20.640
-Sorry!
-It's very breakable!

07:20.799 --> 07:22.919
<i>Pardonnez-moi!</i>

07:23.080 --> 07:25.640
Sorry again! <i>Au revoir!</i>

07:25.799 --> 07:27.479
That means "bye now" in French.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.239
Ah!

07:31.400 --> 07:35.479
The world-famous sunflower
fields of the Loire Valley.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.960
Don't they just give you
the happiest feeling inside?

07:39.120 --> 07:42.440
Actually, they give me
the hungriest feeling, Moon.

07:42.599 --> 07:45.440
I could sure go for some
sunflower seeds right now.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.640
Then let's get
to the finish line fast

07:47.799 --> 07:49.680
so we can fill your tummy!

07:58.080 --> 08:00.560
Look, Ollie!
We caught up to them.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.799
-Nice pedalling, guys!
-Baa-bye!

08:18.120 --> 08:18.960
Hold on.

08:22.239 --> 08:24.000
There's nobody in front of us.

08:24.239 --> 08:25.760
[gasps] I don't believe it.

08:25.919 --> 08:29.520
Moon, we're winning!
We're actually winning!

08:29.679 --> 08:30.880
Go, Moon, go!

08:31.039 --> 08:32.880
Bestest race buddies!

08:33.120 --> 08:34.760
That's the spirit, Ollie!

08:34.919 --> 08:37.120
Our hard work is paying off!

08:37.280 --> 08:38.799
Let's win that trophy!

08:39.079 --> 08:40.079
Whoa!

08:43.319 --> 08:45.040
Yikes!

08:45.199 --> 08:47.120
Uh, where'd they go?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.480
I don't know!
They were just here.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:57.240 --> 09:01.439
-Are you OK, Moon?
-Oh, Ollie, I wrecked our bike.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.079
That's OK, Moon.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.600
Something always goes wrong
when we race Dolly and Zoom.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.880
And we always lose.
So, no big trophy for my shelf.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.600
But maybe
after Dolly and Zoom win,

09:12.800 --> 09:15.280
they'll share
their pyramid of cheese with us.

09:15.439 --> 09:20.400
Wait. The prize includes
a pyramid of cheese?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.199
Yup, a whole pyramid of
the yummiest Loire Valley cheese

09:24.360 --> 09:25.480
you ever nibbled.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.160
But we can't win it
without a bike.

09:28.319 --> 09:31.160
Then we'll make a new bike!

09:31.360 --> 09:33.480
Ollie? What are you doing?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.480
Thinking positive,
like you always do, Moon.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.439
And I am positive
we're gonna win!

09:39.600 --> 09:41.040
Watch this!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.520
Do things go wrong sometimes?

09:43.680 --> 09:47.360
Sure. But we don't quit.
We keep trying!

09:47.520 --> 09:49.240
Besides, I'm hungry enough

09:49.400 --> 09:51.959
to eat that whole
pyramid of cheese.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.439
Go, Ollie, go!

09:53.560 --> 09:54.800
Woo-hoo!

09:54.959 --> 09:55.800
