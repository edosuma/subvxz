HOW DID THE OLD MAN
LAND SUCH A MEGA BABE?

07:40.920 --> 07:42.300
( CHUCKLES )
WELL...NO!

07:42.400 --> 07:44.980
YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE
BEING LIED TO BY MY BOYFRIEND!

07:45.080 --> 07:47.100
I MISSED THE DANCE SHOW

07:52.000 --> 07:53.420
BUT I HAVE TO
GET MY GIRLFRIEND!

07:53.520 --> 07:55.740
JUST SAYING, IF YOU WANT
TO PASS THIS CLASS ââ

07:55.840 --> 07:57.840

LYING TO ME
FOR WEEKS

08:10.000 --> 08:12.160
SO YOU CAN SIT AROUND IN A CAVE
WITH HIGHâSCHOOL KIDS?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.240
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST
LEAVE ME HERE TO ââ

08:13.840 --> 08:14.900
( SCREAMING )

08:15.000 --> 08:16.260

08:16.360 --> 08:17.380
EILEEN,
ARE YOU OKAY?!

08:17.480 --> 08:19.480
DID YOU
FALL DOWN THE ROCK HOLE?

08:18.920 --> 08:21.060
I'M OKAY,
BUT IT'S PITCHâBLACK DOWN HERE.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.500
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET OUT.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.020
I'M COMING DOWN.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.120
ACTUALLY, IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF YOU WENT TO GET HELP.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.740
( SCREAMS )
OHH.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.020
EILEEN,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.980
I WAS GOING TO THE HOSPITAL,
BUT I GOT LOST.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.460
RIGBY, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SICK!
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.860
( SIGHS ) OKAY.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.940
I'M NOT JUST HANGING OUT
IN A CAVE WITH TEENS FOR FUN.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.340
I...

08:40.440 --> 08:42.620
I NEVER GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.100
REALLY?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
THIS WHOLE CAVE THING
IS JUST FOR SCHOOL CREDIT

08:46.160 --> 08:48.160
SO I CAN GRADUATE
AND GET MY DIPLOMA.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.640
I NEVER CARED
UNTIL I SAW THE EILEEN PLAN,

08:49.480 --> 08:50.860
BUT NOW
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

08:50.960 --> 08:52.960
IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE PRESIDENT,

08:52.440 --> 08:54.360
AND I'M JUST GONNA BE
SOME JERK YOU USED TO DATE.

OHH!

09:01.200 --> 09:02.700
WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO?

09:02.800 --> 09:04.860
IT'S WAY TOO DARK
TO FIND A WAY OUT.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.520

I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.700
NO.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.180
RIGBY,
ARE YOU DIGGING?

09:12.280 --> 09:13.940
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE DIGGING.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.180
YOU KNOW CAVES ARE ALREADY
UNDERGROUND, RIGHT?
