00:01.458 --> 00:02.858
Your father and I are separating.

00:02.859 --> 00:04.671
If you want to see other people,
just say so.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.672
Maybe seeing other people
isn't the worst idea.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.431
This stuff with mom,
is it bothering you?

00:08.432 --> 00:11.580
What, her dating, or her and dad
lying to us about Dad's affair with Lori?

00:11.581 --> 00:13.684
How could mom, not be my mom?

00:13.685 --> 00:15.763
<i>One thing we do know,
we are sisters.</i>

00:15.764 --> 00:17.612
Half a dozen little
study buddies.

00:17.613 --> 00:18.764
<i>We're just having fun.</i>

00:18.765 --> 00:21.084
- I just didn't think of you as that...
- As what?

00:21.085 --> 00:22.708
Well, as the kind of person
that would do something

00:22.709 --> 00:24.412
like that with someone
you don't really care about.

00:24.413 --> 00:26.892
Why am I even having
this conversation?

00:27.208 --> 00:30.050
<i>(Gabe) I couldn't help but notice
you were flying solo at the fair.</i>

00:30.051 --> 00:30.932
No boyfriend?

00:30.933 --> 00:32.595
I am not discussing
my personal life.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.243
- Why?
- I'm your guidance counselor.

00:34.244 --> 00:36.125
<i>(Ofe) People don't just get
dizzy and faint out of nowhere.</i>

00:36.126 --> 00:36.923
Taylor!

00:36.924 --> 00:38.596
I think that it was
just a weird reaction

00:38.597 --> 00:39.615
to the study buddies.

00:39.616 --> 00:40.772
Taylor, this is not you.

00:40.773 --> 00:41.904
What do you even know about me?

00:41.905 --> 00:43.128
You're not my boyfriend.

00:43.129 --> 00:44.279
You sure about this?

00:44.280 --> 00:45.480
Getting sure.

00:45.481 --> 00:46.959
<i>- (Elizabeth) Where's Crash?
- (Carter) He's gone.</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:48.911
I am so sorry, honey.

00:53.439 --> 00:57.335
##

00:57.336 --> 00:59.112
(Taylor) Come on,
come on, come on.

00:59.113 --> 01:00.406
Go!

01:01.615 --> 01:02.976
What's wrong?

01:02.977 --> 01:04.384
I told Abby
I'd be there on time.

01:04.385 --> 01:06.215
You're ten minutes late,
Tay, you're fine.

01:06.216 --> 01:07.367
She put me in charge.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.470
Laura's doing this thing
for the whole region.

01:09.471 --> 01:10.964
I have to be on my a-game.

01:10.965 --> 01:12.384
(Tires screeching)

01:12.385 --> 01:14.716
Yeah, and get there
in one piece, Taylor.

01:14.717 --> 01:16.739
Well, if you hadn't stopped
to take in the mail.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.811
Mom asked me to.

01:24.164 --> 01:25.940
What is that, anyway?

01:25.941 --> 01:27.436
Another letter from Lori.

01:27.737 --> 01:30.123
Why does she keep writing
when you never answer?

01:30.124 --> 01:31.404
Can't she take a hint?

01:33.159 --> 01:34.883
I guess not.

01:36.331 --> 01:38.320
I'm so late.

01:41.104 --> 01:42.568
Taylor.

01:44.768 --> 01:45.936
Taylor!

Oh, God.

Oh my God.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.415
- (Carter) Are you okay?
- (Woman) Yeah, I'm fine.

02:20.416 --> 02:22.727
I went ahead and called the police,
they should be here soon.

02:22.728 --> 02:24.567
Okay, thank you.

02:24.568 --> 02:26.752
Maybe you should text Abby,
tell her what happened.

02:27.584 --> 02:28.663
Are you okay?

02:28.664 --> 02:30.080
You don't think the
cops will test me, do you?

02:30.081 --> 02:31.083
For what?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.999
Just, you know, for like
anything in my system.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.632
Why, are you drunk?

02:34.633 --> 02:35.311
No, I...

02:36.112 --> 02:38.264
I took something this morning.

02:38.265 --> 02:40.048
- (Siren blaring in the distance)
- What?

02:40.892 --> 02:42.111
A pill.

02:46.272 --> 02:48.116
It was to help me concentrate.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.755
(Man)
Hey, is everyone all right here?

02:50.756 --> 02:51.941
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

02:51.942 --> 02:52.836
Do you need an ambulance?

02:52.837 --> 02:54.491
- No, no, we're good.
- No, no, we're good.

02:54.492 --> 02:55.788
I'm gonna have to file a report.

02:57.515 --> 02:59.779
So... who was driving?

03:01.299 --> 03:02.439
I was.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.972
Sorry, totally my fault.

03:03.973 --> 03:05.620
Don't know where my brain was.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.507
##

03:13.708 --> 03:15.420
Hey, I thought you
caught a ride with

03:15.421 --> 03:16.391
Carter and Taylor.

03:16.392 --> 03:18.344
Oh, no, they rushed out early.

03:18.345 --> 03:20.288
You know I like to take my
time in the mornings.

03:20.289 --> 03:22.880
Long shower, full breakfast.

03:22.881 --> 03:24.416
Read the paper with some coffee.

03:24.417 --> 03:26.528
- Exactly.
- Uh-huh.

03:26.529 --> 03:27.864
Just don't miss the bus.

03:29.757 --> 03:31.578
- Hey.
- Hey. (Clearing throat)

03:31.579 --> 03:33.427
Oh, hey, Grant, what's up?

03:33.428 --> 03:34.394
Nothing.

03:36.628 --> 03:39.939
(Cell phone alerting)

03:39.940 --> 03:42.163
- Important?
- Okay, you know what?

03:42.164 --> 03:43.157
We'll talk about it later.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.210
- How's school for you?
- Wouldn't know.

03:46.211 --> 03:47.796
Haven't made it there yet.

03:47.797 --> 03:49.396
He was just about
to catch the bus.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.244
Hey, I got the squad car today.

03:52.245 --> 03:53.380
How cool would it be

03:53.381 --> 03:54.672
pulling up in a police car?

03:54.673 --> 03:55.807
What, am I five?

03:55.808 --> 03:57.360
Uh, Kyle,
why don't we just take off?

03:57.361 --> 03:58.619
I have a pile of paperwork
at my desk.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.163
- See you later, Grant.
- Okay, bye, hon.

04:01.164 --> 04:02.444
And don't miss the bus.

04:06.032 --> 04:08.904
(Cell phone alerting)

04:16.070 --> 04:17.951
Sorry, Kyle.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.668
(Dishwasher whirring)

04:24.169 --> 04:25.639
Wait, what are we
gonna do about the car?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.432
Taylor, it's just a dent,
we can get it fixed.

04:28.433 --> 04:28.880
When?

04:28.881 --> 04:30.832
I don't want
mom and dad to see it.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.259
Okay, well, then we'll
figure something out.

04:34.260 --> 04:35.508
I'll call Max or something.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.812
Yeah, he'll know what to do.

04:36.813 --> 04:38.636
And I have money,
I can pay for it.

04:38.637 --> 04:40.396
Taylor, stop
worrying about this.

04:40.397 --> 04:42.475
You've got so much
other stuff going on.

04:42.476 --> 04:43.660
You're right.

04:43.661 --> 04:44.916
I'm so late.

04:44.917 --> 04:45.860
Thank you.

04:49.308 --> 04:51.299
For what you did.

04:51.884 --> 04:54.837
Okay, no problem.

04:56.245 --> 04:59.291
♪ For things I cannot do ♪
♪

05:02.980 --> 05:05.160
Hey, Max, it's me.

05:05.661 --> 05:07.588
Listen, are you free
this morning?

05:07.589 --> 05:09.678
I kind of need your
help with something.

05:10.279 --> 05:11.506
Hey, Taylor.

05:11.507 --> 05:13.014
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late.

05:13.015 --> 05:14.089
No problem, are you okay?

05:14.090 --> 05:15.554
- I got your text.
- Yeah.

05:15.555 --> 05:16.785
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm just...

05:16.786 --> 05:18.058
- No, I'm fine.
- Okay.

05:18.659 --> 05:20.530
I brought reinforcements.

05:20.531 --> 05:22.307
- Abby said you could use some help.
- We're at your service.

05:22.308 --> 05:23.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.331
I guess I could use
them for something.

05:25.332 --> 05:26.587
Yeah, take advantage of them.

05:26.588 --> 05:30.379
Because I want you as
calm as possible

05:30.380 --> 05:32.132
for when you meet
with Yale tomorrow.

05:32.627 --> 05:34.452
- Really?
- Yup.

05:34.453 --> 05:35.836
I talked you up
to the recruiter.

05:35.837 --> 05:36.728
Excellent.

05:36.729 --> 05:37.745
Welcome to the club.

05:37.746 --> 05:39.153
He wants to
meet you first thing.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.849
Thank you so much, Abby.

05:42.338 --> 05:44.081
No problem.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.753
Gabe, why don't you help me hang
that banner at the entrance?

05:46.754 --> 05:47.609
Yeah.

05:47.610 --> 05:49.954
And, Damon, why don't you help
Taylor fold these pamphlets?

05:49.955 --> 05:51.384
That may be under utilizing

05:51.385 --> 05:53.905
my rather impressive
intellectual abilities.

05:53.906 --> 05:56.145
Maybe you can cure cancer
while you're folding.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.742
That's a distinct possibility.

05:58.743 --> 06:01.877
##

06:04.165 --> 06:05.972
Something is wrong with her

06:05.973 --> 06:07.612
and I can't
figure out what it is.

06:08.397 --> 06:10.317
She's got a lot going on.

06:10.318 --> 06:12.052
Yeah, but she always does.

06:12.053 --> 06:14.437
She's like the poster child
for staying cool.

06:14.438 --> 06:16.086
Not lately.

06:16.087 --> 06:19.349
Do you think maybe
you could talk to her?

06:19.350 --> 06:21.717
I feel like it's kind of
none of my business anymore.

06:21.718 --> 06:22.774
Please?

06:23.275 --> 06:25.113
I don't want it to seem like

06:25.114 --> 06:26.153
I'm lecturing her

06:26.154 --> 06:28.297
and I'm pretty sure
she's gonna stop listening

06:28.298 --> 06:30.170
if it's always coming from me.

06:30.171 --> 06:32.089
I'll give it a go.

06:33.129 --> 06:35.688
Don't worry about the car,
though, I got that.

06:35.689 --> 06:37.081
Thanks.

06:37.082 --> 06:39.029
(School bell ringing)

06:39.330 --> 06:40.697
Get to class.

06:41.298 --> 06:42.344
Okay.

06:42.345 --> 06:45.570
##

06:45.571 --> 06:47.174
Hey, Damon. Hey, Tay.

06:47.175 --> 06:48.539
Hey, Bird.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.925
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:49.926 --> 06:50.853
Hey.

06:50.854 --> 06:52.463
Have you guys seen Abby?

06:52.464 --> 06:53.613
She's supposed to help me write

06:53.614 --> 06:55.285
- my letters of recommendation.
- Abby?

06:55.286 --> 06:56.391
Oh, yeah, yeah, she's...

06:56.392 --> 06:58.280
She's around here, somewhere.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.721
You know, I don't
see her now, though.

07:04.936 --> 07:06.552
Okay, then.

07:06.553 --> 07:07.503
Thanks.

07:07.504 --> 07:09.175
Sorry.

07:09.176 --> 07:11.263
No worries.

07:14.319 --> 07:16.128
Did you see that?

07:16.129 --> 07:18.088
She looked right through me.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.847
Oh no, she...

07:19.848 --> 07:22.632
She looked around you.

07:23.296 --> 07:25.311
- Around?
- Yeah.

07:25.892 --> 07:28.388
Okay, I call that progress.

07:28.389 --> 07:30.803
That's great, you're
meeting the Yale guy.

07:30.804 --> 07:32.483
I'm meeting him tomorrow, too.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.611
What are you gonna talk about?

07:35.875 --> 07:38.123
I guess the essay I'm working on

07:38.124 --> 07:39.683
for their summer econ program.

07:39.684 --> 07:40.692
Oh, you applied for that?

07:40.693 --> 07:42.980
Yeah, anything to get out
of here for the summer.

07:42.981 --> 07:44.836
Yeah, I feel you.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.227
I applied, too.

07:46.228 --> 07:47.836
My parents were pushing
the whole

07:47.837 --> 07:50.467
European family nightmare.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.332
That'd be great, right?

07:53.636 --> 07:56.740
- If we both got in?
- Yeah, it'd be fun.

07:56.741 --> 07:57.988
Can I read yours?

07:57.989 --> 07:58.691
Not yet.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.548
It's an outline.

08:01.235 --> 08:04.036
You know they're
due tomorrow, right?

08:04.037 --> 08:05.819
No, Friday.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.020
Tay, seriously?

08:08.684 --> 08:10.547
I'm pretty sure...

08:15.395 --> 08:16.961
Oh my God.

08:17.462 --> 08:19.492
No, no, no, no, no,
how could this happen?

08:19.493 --> 08:20.711
I put this in my calendar.

08:20.712 --> 08:22.223
Why don't you
talk to the recruiter,

08:22.224 --> 08:24.376
see if he can give you
an extension?

08:24.377 --> 08:25.759
No, are you kidding?

08:25.760 --> 08:27.360
How is it gonna sound
when I tell him

08:27.361 --> 08:30.128
I forgot a simple thing
like an application deadline?

08:30.129 --> 08:32.392
Oh my God, I am so
irresponsible.

08:33.464 --> 08:34.831
Damn it.

09:22.678 --> 09:24.386
He's setting up shop
like he lives here.

09:25.133 --> 09:28.102
A few days ago, he deleted
"The Walking Dead" off the DVR.

09:28.621 --> 09:30.182
That's why you're mad?

09:31.247 --> 09:32.134
That doesn't justify

09:32.135 --> 09:34.354
destroying his phone, Grant.

09:34.355 --> 09:36.314
Are you trying to embarrass me?

09:36.315 --> 09:38.018
Well, you and dad

09:38.019 --> 09:40.650
are dating other people
while you're still married,

09:40.651 --> 09:43.882
so I'd say you're doing
a great job

09:43.883 --> 09:45.394
embarrassing yourself.

09:46.978 --> 09:51.130
##

09:51.131 --> 09:52.697
I didn't have any idea

09:52.698 --> 09:55.107
that it was bothering
you so much, Grant.

09:55.108 --> 09:57.282
You and dad don't
listen to anything I say.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.105
I'm the result of a...

10:00.106 --> 10:02.578
Rejecting, neglecting
parenting style.

10:02.579 --> 10:03.723
Rejecting, neglecting?

10:03.724 --> 10:04.818
Where did you get that term?

10:06.218 --> 10:08.370
- My shrink.
- Your shrink.

10:09.122 --> 10:11.034
Grandma's friend?

10:11.035 --> 10:13.692
She's been taking you
to see her all this time?

10:15.411 --> 10:16.948
(Sighing)

10:18.436 --> 10:22.740
##

10:22.741 --> 10:23.964
Hey.

10:23.965 --> 10:26.355
I'm gonna head home, you coming?

10:26.356 --> 10:27.691
No, I can't.

10:27.692 --> 10:29.044
I'm barely ready for tomorrow

10:29.045 --> 10:30.860
and I still have to
finish that application.

10:30.861 --> 10:31.556
Okay.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.910
- What application?
- The Yale summer program.

10:35.911 --> 10:38.110
Also due tomorrow.

10:38.837 --> 10:42.202
Taylor, I could do
all of this for you.

10:42.690 --> 10:43.770
What?

10:43.771 --> 10:46.139
Yeah, you go home,
get your application done

10:46.140 --> 10:47.955
and I'll stay here and finish
all of this stuff.

10:47.956 --> 10:50.793
There is really
a lot to get done.

10:50.794 --> 10:52.586
It's fine, honestly.

10:53.042 --> 10:55.442
You have a ton of stuff
going on right now

10:55.443 --> 10:57.977
and I actually don't,
for once in my life.

10:57.978 --> 11:00.025
Plus, I have these, uh,

11:00.026 --> 11:02.850
hidden organizational talents
that nobody knows about...

11:04.058 --> 11:05.594
Because I've hidden them,

11:05.595 --> 11:10.078
but I swear I have them
and I really want to help.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.845
Please let me help.

11:12.846 --> 11:13.782
Come on.

11:15.147 --> 11:17.257
- Okay.
- Great.

11:17.258 --> 11:17.874
Okay.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.858
Tell me what I need to do.

11:20.474 --> 11:22.827

Yeah, okay.

11:30.302 --> 11:31.298

11:31.699 --> 11:32.850

12:44.087 --> 12:45.160

13:16.144 --> 13:18.373
No, he had some...
He had some lessons.

13:18.374 --> 13:19.655
The point is you went

13:19.656 --> 13:21.135

13:21.136 --> 13:23.536

told you not to.

13:23.537 --> 13:24.999
Well, what is the harm here?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.407
The harm is that you
crossed a line, again.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.894
It's because he is struggling,

13:29.895 --> 13:31.922

19:38.514 --> 19:40.600
A bit of refreshments

19:40.601 --> 19:42.865
Please tell me this isn't water.

19:43.704 --> 19:44.777
Mmm.

19:45.964 --> 19:46.971

20:25.379 --> 20:27.035
Okay, it's not a party, Taylor.

20:27.036 --> 20:28.355
It doesn't even matter.

20:29.170 --> 20:31.450
If you could just
get everybody out

20:31.451 --> 20:33.395
so I can finish this myself.

20:33.396 --> 20:35.475
Taylor, you don't
have to do it by yourself.

20:35.476 --> 20:37.346
All these people came
here to help.

20:37.347 --> 20:37.955
Wow.

20:37.956 --> 20:40.410
What a big help.

20:40.411 --> 20:42.254
That's just your thing, right?

20:42.255 --> 20:45.319
- What?
- Your need to save the day?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.855
Poor Taylor.

20:46.856 --> 20:48.863
Oh, so pathetic.

20:48.864 --> 20:50.511
You had to save
my ass with the cops

20:50.512 --> 20:52.414
and now you're taking over
the expo because I'm,

20:52.415 --> 20:55.218
what, just some lame druggie?

20:55.219 --> 20:57.603
That is so not what I was doing.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.451
And then you get Max
to pull this

21:00.452 --> 21:02.979
secret mission
and try and fix me.

21:03.443 --> 21:06.154
I wasn't trying to
fix you, Taylor.

21:06.155 --> 21:06.691
Taylor!

21:06.692 --> 21:08.508
What do you think?

21:08.509 --> 21:09.711
About what?

21:09.712 --> 21:10.519
My mural.

21:12.622 --> 21:14.830
- You don't want to know.
- Yeah, I do.

21:14.831 --> 21:16.638
I think it sucks, Bird.

21:16.639 --> 21:19.257
It has nothing
to do with the expo.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.801
You know what?

21:22.802 --> 21:25.821
Thank you all so much
for your hard work,

21:25.822 --> 21:27.437
I really, really appreciate it,

21:27.438 --> 21:28.765
uh, but you can go home,

21:28.766 --> 21:30.461
'cause I'm gonna
take it from here.

21:30.462 --> 21:31.220
Taylor...

21:32.588 --> 21:34.269
None of these people

21:34.270 --> 21:36.621
have anywhere else they
need to be tonight.

21:36.622 --> 21:41.028
Carter, I need to
do this now, by myself.

21:41.741 --> 21:43.332
Thank you.

21:47.862 --> 21:50.110

21:50.575 --> 21:52.831
Um, I'm sorry.

21:53.287 --> 21:55.079
My year's allowance
will go towards

21:55.080 --> 21:56.487
buying you a new phone.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.710
You know...
Don't worry about it.

21:59.711 --> 22:01.214
I was due for an upgrade.

22:01.215 --> 22:03.015
All right, Kyle's
gonna drive me to work

22:03.016 --> 22:04.903
and you might see me
after school,

22:04.904 --> 22:07.275
but it's your dad's
night tonight, okay?

22:07.276 --> 22:09.695
All right, so will you be at
Kyle's place or our house?

22:10.650 --> 22:12.545
- What?
- Mom.

22:15.743 --> 22:18.256
Was this not public knowledge?

22:19.201 --> 22:21.540
That you've been
sleeping at his place?

22:22.669 --> 22:24.524
Maybe I'll go wait in the car.

22:26.556 --> 22:28.981
Grant, I am sorry.

22:28.982 --> 22:31.013
I was going to tell you.

22:31.861 --> 22:33.557
You have to understand

22:33.558 --> 22:36.157
how hard this
whole situation is.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.165
Whatever.

22:39.166 --> 22:41.068

It's no petty crime,
sleeping with a student.

- Who was it, do you know?
- No, we don't know.

29:33.501 --> 29:34.557
We're still investigating it,

29:34.558 --> 29:35.755
but her fiancée swore...

29:35.756 --> 29:36.571
Her fiancée?

29:36.572 --> 29:37.803
Yeah, that's who turned her in.

29:38.388 --> 29:40.940
He thought she was just
having an affair,

29:40.941 --> 29:43.403
then he realized
it was a student.

29:48.363 --> 29:49.995
Did you question her?

29:49.996 --> 29:50.499
Oh, yeah.

30:00.356 --> 30:03.024
So you don't know who
she was sleeping with?

30:03.025 --> 30:04.791
No.

30:04.792 --> 30:07.200
Well, her fiancée claims

30:07.201 --> 30:08.992
he saw a bunch of texts,

30:08.993 --> 30:10.975
but without a witness,

30:10.976 --> 30:12.498
I'm gonna have to cut her loose.

30:15.986 --> 30:17.994

Yeah, maybe.

30:26.030 --> 30:27.597
You know, we haven't
hung out in a while.

30:27.598 --> 30:28.605
I've been busy at work.

30:28.606 --> 30:29.895
- Dad, it's okay.
- No.

30:29.896 --> 30:33.699
I've... I've dropped the ball.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.363
I just want you to know...

30:39.843 --> 30:41.235
I'm here.

30:44.211 --> 30:45.731
Thanks.

30:53.539 --> 30:54.667
Hey.

30:55.947 --> 30:57.812
The insurance company called.

30:59.156 --> 31:01.476
It was an accident, I'm sorry.

31:01.477 --> 31:02.676
I thought Carter was driving.

31:02.677 --> 31:04.119
I was driving.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.271
Why didn't you call me?

31:05.272 --> 31:08.432
Because it wasn't a big deal,
no one was hurt.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.215
Yeah, and Max is
gonna fix the car.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.574
I don't care about the car.

31:11.575 --> 31:12.815
I care about you two.

31:12.816 --> 31:14.007
What happened?

31:16.432 --> 31:18.864
I got distracted for
like a second.

31:19.808 --> 31:21.503
You got distracted?

31:21.504 --> 31:22.143
By what?

31:23.352 --> 31:25.286
Were you on the phone?

31:25.287 --> 31:26.240
No.

31:26.241 --> 31:28.942
Were you texting?

31:30.487 --> 31:31.827
Were you?

31:31.828 --> 31:34.052
It wasn't her fault.

31:34.053 --> 31:35.235
How many times have we told you

31:35.236 --> 31:36.843
not to use the phone
in the car?!

31:36.844 --> 31:37.228
I know.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.451
You could have
been killed, Carter,

31:39.452 --> 31:41.284
or your sister could
have been killed.

31:41.285 --> 31:42.842
Mom, we're fine.

31:42.843 --> 31:44.755
No, you're lucky,
that's what you are.

31:49.972 --> 31:50.971
I'm sorry.

31:50.972 --> 31:52.771
No, that's not gonna cut it.

31:54.587 --> 31:56.659
You're grounded.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.668
Home and school and that's it.

31:58.669 --> 31:59.963
- What?!
- Mom, that is so unfair.

31:59.964 --> 32:01.124
What is so unfair about it?

32:01.125 --> 32:03.399
She knew the rules and she
chose to ignore them.

32:04.344 --> 32:06.722
End of discussion.

32:19.968 --> 32:21.787
Movie night.

32:21.788 --> 32:23.899
Oh, uh, wait.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.114
Before you do that.

32:27.098 --> 32:29.699
We have something that we
want to talk to you about.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.746
You really scared us.

32:30.747 --> 32:33.322
You can't just skip school
and disappear like that.

32:33.323 --> 32:35.059
But I needed to just get away.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.387
No, I get it.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.196
We understand that
you're frustrated

32:38.197 --> 32:40.507
and you have every right to be.

32:41.115 --> 32:42.619
I, um...

32:42.620 --> 32:46.099
I haven't been doing
a very good job lately.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.681
I know that it was hard to learn

32:48.682 --> 32:51.047
that I was staying at Kyle's,

32:51.048 --> 32:52.535
and I'm sorry.

32:52.536 --> 32:54.358
But we are going to make sure,

32:54.359 --> 32:56.959
going forward, that
things are better for you.

32:56.960 --> 32:57.430
All right.

32:57.431 --> 33:01.007
So do you have anything
you'd like to talk about?

33:04.015 --> 33:06.927
Patricia always says
that I should...

33:06.928 --> 33:10.087
Be open and
honest with you guys.

33:15.447 --> 33:19.083
I want to live with
grandma and grandpa.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.387

34:19.215 --> 34:20.389
No.

34:22.091 --> 34:24.356
I really liked her.

34:25.210 --> 34:27.627

34:27.628 --> 34:30.260
And that's what

Suddenly you're shy?

35:06.779 --> 35:09.531
- Thanks, by the way.
- For what?

35:10.459 --> 35:12.539
Being a friend.

mom was gonna

35:53.657 --> 35:55.136
freak out that much
about the accident,

35:55.137 --> 35:57.287
so I'm just gonna tell her
that I was driving.

35:57.968 --> 36:00.703
No, it's fine,
Tay, I don't want you to.

36:03.399 --> 36:06.024
I've been thinking
about something.

36:06.784 --> 36:09.824
About why you're
not feeling any better.

36:16.356 --> 36:20.387
I think it's about Lori.

36:20.388 --> 36:23.899
About her being our
biological mother.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.339
I think that's
where this all started.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.428
Lori told us the truth

36:27.429 --> 36:28.891
and then...

36:30.124 --> 36:32.683
Things just started
to fall apart.

36:32.684 --> 36:36.059
Like with Max
and with mom and dad.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.315
Look, I know you don't
like talking about it,

36:39.316 --> 36:42.091
or her...

36:43.999 --> 36:48.020
But that was
a huge deal, Taylor.

36:48.821 --> 36:50.664
That kind of news has
the potential

36:50.665 --> 36:53.439
to make even the most
secure and together person

36:53.440 --> 36:54.887
on the planet...

36:55.512 --> 36:59.471
Feel completely lost.

37:02.551 --> 37:05.896
I hate that she's my mother.

37:07.656 --> 37:10.631
That she's...

37:10.632 --> 37:12.164
Somehow...

37:12.165 --> 37:16.267
A part of me.

37:17.690 --> 37:20.451
I don't want to think about it.

37:21.923 --> 37:25.011
I just want it to go away.

37:25.012 --> 37:27.959
I hate her for
what she's done to you.

37:28.660 --> 37:31.339
To all of us.

37:31.340 --> 37:34.787
But please, don't shut us out.

37:35.940 --> 37:38.171
Please.

37:38.472 --> 37:41.523
It just feels kind of lonely.

37:42.124 --> 37:44.497
Yeah.

37:50.321 --> 37:52.459
I'm here.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.916
You're always gonna have me.

37:55.917 --> 37:59.879
I am always gonna have
your back, okay?

38:00.664 --> 38:03.139
You're pretty much
stuck with me.

38:04.671 --> 38:06.215
Come here.

38:06.216 --> 38:07.089
It's okay.

38:19.106 --> 38:20.730
I have an idea.

38:20.731 --> 38:21.674
Oh no.

38:22.075 --> 38:24.013
I think we need to dance.

38:25.114 --> 38:26.177
