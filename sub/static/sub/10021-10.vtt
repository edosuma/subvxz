00:07.216 --> 00:08.376
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:09.084 --> 00:11.348
We'd be better off as friends.

00:12.421 --> 00:14.286
Mark, thanks again for dinner.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.583
God forbid you listen to me and learn!

00:16.792 --> 00:18.987
Yes, I was engaged once.

00:19.328 --> 00:20.795
To a really lovely man.

00:20.996 --> 00:24.488
And he was killed in a freak
horseback riding accident.

00:29.538 --> 00:33.406
You bring a child into this world,
and you think they're helpless.

00:33.609 --> 00:37.067
But, actually, I think it's us.
We're the ones that are helpless.

00:39.715 --> 00:42.684
- What time's that big do at your mom's?
- Right after church.

00:42.885 --> 00:46.582
I promised her we'd be there for
Christmas caroling with Uncle Ted.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.455
That the old guy with the banjo?

00:51.894 --> 00:55.694
It's a family tradition, kind of
like going to Mass on Christmas Eve.

00:55.898 --> 00:58.332
If I go, I'll feel like a hypocrite.

00:58.534 --> 01:01.025
- Kneeling and standing and...
- You could just sit.

01:01.236 --> 01:04.262
Everybody gives me dirty looks.
Like I'm a pagan.

01:04.473 --> 01:06.065
You are a pagan.

01:06.709 --> 01:09.610
Oh, what a glorious day!
Did you see the sky?

01:09.812 --> 01:12.542
- It's like a painting.
- Makes you glad to be alive.

01:12.748 --> 01:14.909
- Unless you're being persecuted.
- What?

01:15.117 --> 01:18.450
- He doesn't like Dr. Lee's new system.
- What new system?

01:18.654 --> 01:21.487
Patients get two charts:
For docs and for nurses.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.817
We get to do our notes
at the same time.

01:24.026 --> 01:26.620
Orders get in quicker,
patients get meds faster.

01:26.829 --> 01:30.356
Docs don't waste time chasing charts.
So, what's the problem?

01:30.566 --> 01:34.161
"Someone" has to keep track
of twice as many charts as normal...

01:34.370 --> 01:36.998
...doubling his workload.
Not that anyone cares.

01:37.206 --> 01:38.434
Good morning, gang.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.404
Oh, my God, Amanda!
What have you done?

01:41.610 --> 01:45.671
Christmas nibblies: Dried fruit,
mixed nuts, little chocolate reindeer.

01:45.881 --> 01:47.246
Don't mind if I do.

01:47.449 --> 01:50.009
Wait. First dibs should go to Jerry.

01:50.219 --> 01:54.212
It's only fair since he's bearing
the brunt of the new charting system.

01:54.423 --> 01:56.288
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

01:56.492 --> 02:00.428
As you wish. Seriously, if you find
yourself in the weeds, call me.

02:00.629 --> 02:02.790
- I'll make sure you get support.
- Sure.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.295
Excuse me.

02:08.971 --> 02:12.372
That's a Christmas card image,
the sight of you wrapping a book.

02:12.574 --> 02:15.099
Something educational
for one of your nieces?

02:15.310 --> 02:17.073
No. Actually, it's for you.

02:17.279 --> 02:18.906
It's T.S. Eliot.

02:19.248 --> 02:22.684
I know you said you liked him,
so I got it last month...

02:22.885 --> 02:24.580
...when we were still, you know...

02:24.820 --> 02:26.617
Peter, that's so sweet.

02:28.424 --> 02:31.086
I can't think of
a more thoughtful gift.

02:33.796 --> 02:35.161
Thank you.

02:37.433 --> 02:40.163
Oh, please, forget it.
Listen, I was wondering...

02:40.369 --> 02:42.963
...if we could finish
our workups around noon.

02:43.172 --> 02:45.333
I need to get out of here
early tonight.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.873
Oh, you've got big
Christmas Eve plans.

02:48.077 --> 02:51.638
Yeah. My sister's hosting a dinner.
Carla's gonna bring Reece by.

02:51.847 --> 02:54.543
- I haven't seen him all week.
- I understand.

02:54.750 --> 02:58.242
I absolutely hate being away
from my family during the holidays.

02:58.454 --> 03:02.083
In fact, I'm so desperate not to be
alone this Christmas Eve...

03:03.926 --> 03:07.157
...that I bought a ticket
to the Surgeons' Society Gala.

03:07.362 --> 03:09.421
Oh, golly.

03:09.631 --> 03:12.759
Yep. And you won't believe
who's sitting next to me.

03:12.968 --> 03:15.493
Hey, there she is!

03:15.704 --> 03:19.037
So I checked around.
We definitely have the coolest table.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.835
It's lucky we're both able to make it.

03:22.044 --> 03:23.807
A little trouble in paradise?

03:24.012 --> 03:27.106
Anyway, so tonight's dinner
is semiformal...

03:27.316 --> 03:32.447
...so any slinky black number will do.
If I may voice my preference...

03:32.654 --> 03:35.521
...something short
and off-the-shoulder would be ideal.

03:35.724 --> 03:37.692
Peter, by the way, that reminds me.

03:38.360 --> 03:42.228
I have a lot of charts
and I want to get out of here early.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.628
- I need you to cover my rounds.
- That'll mess up my morning.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.859
Look at it this way. I get a life...

03:48.070 --> 03:50.504
...and you earn a special place
in my heart.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074

04:41.190 --> 04:46.184
Do you know a garage that's open?
My crappy car died on the Dan Ryan.

04:46.395 --> 04:48.659
On Christmas Eve? Good luck.

04:48.864 --> 04:50.991
- Lydia, is that...?
- Card from Jen.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.931
- My ex-wife sent you a Christmas card?
- No. She sent one to me.

04:55.137 --> 04:58.504
We've exchanged cards for years.
Christmas, birthdays...

04:58.707 --> 05:02.074
- I was reading the newsletter.
- "Merry Christmas from the Simons."

05:02.277 --> 05:04.245
- What?
- Their new house sounds amazing.

05:04.446 --> 05:07.779
- I know. 5000 square feet?
- Six bedrooms, three baths?

05:07.983 --> 05:11.180
That sounds just like Jen
to be bragging about her house.

05:11.386 --> 05:14.253
- I wouldn't call it bragging.
- She's sharing good news.

05:14.456 --> 05:16.720
- Yeah, Jen made partner.
- Jen made partner?

05:16.925 --> 05:20.861
- The firm even got her a new Beemer.
- I love those convertibles.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.461
Oh, you know what?
Mack's Garage on Wacker is open.

05:24.666 --> 05:27.601
- They'll tow your piece-of-crap car.
- Thanks, Jerry.

05:27.903 --> 05:31.168
"Dear Dr. Carter, I'm sure
you don't remember me.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.501
I wouldn't be around this Christmas
if not for you.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.077
You're a lifesaver.
The Lord's instrument on earth."

05:38.280 --> 05:40.840
- Pacer pads?
- Third drawer on the left.

05:41.049 --> 05:45.918
"May God bless you and keep you.
Merry Christmas. Emily Ropella."

05:46.121 --> 05:48.419
- Do you remember her?
- Not a clue.

05:48.624 --> 05:50.091
It's a nice card, though.

05:50.292 --> 05:52.760
Does it bother you
that God gets the credit?

05:52.961 --> 05:56.362
One can be called worse things
than "an instrument of God."

05:56.565 --> 05:58.396
So you believe in...?

05:59.568 --> 06:01.695
I give Him the benefit of the doubt.

06:02.004 --> 06:03.471
- You?
- I don't know.

06:04.006 --> 06:07.840
Sometimes I think that God
is just this comforting illusion.

06:08.043 --> 06:11.604
We want everything to have meaning,
so we create this puppet master...

06:11.813 --> 06:16.978
...when everything is just arbitrary:
Life, death, natural disasters...

06:19.254 --> 06:21.245
The Master is displeased.

06:21.857 --> 06:24.883
I'm so sorry. I can't believe
he foisted this on you.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.788
No use worrying about it now.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.361
I'll start the preops.
That'll save time.

06:29.564 --> 06:30.553
Whatever.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.100
Hello, Mr. Gardner.

06:33.302 --> 06:35.793
I have the results of your MRI.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.973
Good. So, how's it look?

06:39.174 --> 06:44.043
Good news. It appears the cancer
hasn't spread beyond the capsule.

06:44.446 --> 06:48.507
Great. So does this mean
I can hold on to my prostate?

06:48.717 --> 06:51.550
I'm afraid not.
Dr. Romano does want to continue...

06:51.753 --> 06:55.484
...with the radical prostatectomy
tomorrow morning as scheduled.

06:55.691 --> 07:00.219
But with the surgery, you stand an
excellent chance of beating the cancer.

07:00.829 --> 07:03.354
It really is very good news.

07:05.934 --> 07:08.801
- Is Dr. Romano around?
- He's in surgery.

07:09.004 --> 07:11.131
Is it something I can help you with?

07:11.340 --> 07:16.039
He had mentioned the operation could
result in my losing sexual function.

07:16.244 --> 07:17.905
I take it that's still the case?

07:18.113 --> 07:20.809
We'll do our best to do
a nerve-sparing procedure.

07:21.016 --> 07:24.816
- But there is that possibility, yes.
- How strong a possibility?

07:25.253 --> 07:29.986
Well, according to Dr. Romano's notes,
as high as 75 to 80 percent.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.588
Eighty percent.

07:36.565 --> 07:39.830
Has Dr. Romano discussed
your options...

07:40.035 --> 07:42.401
...about having children
in the future?

07:42.604 --> 07:43.571
No.

07:43.872 --> 07:46.363
Well, you might want to consider...

07:46.575 --> 07:48.600
...paying a visit to a sperm bank.

07:48.877 --> 07:51.004
That way, if there's
a loss of function...

07:51.213 --> 07:54.614
...you can still have children
through alternative means.

07:55.917 --> 07:56.747
Right.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.810
Dr. Lee?

08:00.188 --> 08:01.382
You startled me.

08:01.590 --> 08:04.525
Sorry. Dr. Anspaugh would
like you to call him.

08:04.993 --> 08:07.052
What's wrong with Dr. Greene's locker?

08:07.596 --> 08:10.929
I found it ajar. I shut it
before something walked away.

08:11.133 --> 08:13.158
- Thanks for the message.
- Sure.

08:13.468 --> 08:17.234
I've got supraventricular tachycardia.
It happens all the time.

08:17.439 --> 08:19.634
Rate's 160. BP's 100 palp.

08:19.841 --> 08:22.241
Just cardiovert me at 50
and I'm on my way.

08:22.444 --> 08:24.844
Let's put him on a monitor
and get a strip.

08:25.614 --> 08:28.674
I'm trying to tell you,
I've got SVTs.

08:28.884 --> 08:32.251
Just cardiovert me at 50.
It works every time.

08:32.453 --> 08:35.514
I appreciate the tip.
But I need to examine you myself.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.522
- I'm trying to save some time here.
- Stop talking.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.217
Would you tell him that I have SVTs?

08:41.663 --> 08:43.392
I've got SVTs!

08:43.597 --> 08:44.860
- Let go.
- I've got SVTs!

08:45.066 --> 08:47.364
I heard you!
I need to examine you myself.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.503
- I'm gonna be late for work!
- Let go!

08:49.704 --> 08:51.501
Are you one of Santa's helpers?

08:52.707 --> 08:57.440
The helpers just pass out the goody
bags. I'm an elf. A singing elf.

08:57.646 --> 08:59.841
- Oh, part of a choir?
- There's four of us.

09:00.048 --> 09:04.075
But thanks to "Super Doc," the
Elf Tones are gonna be a tenor short.

09:04.286 --> 09:07.016
- Here you go.
- It says I have SVTs, right?

09:07.289 --> 09:10.486
I knew it! You want to shock me
at 50 now, smart-ass?

09:10.692 --> 09:12.489
I got an 18-year-old, flatline!

09:12.694 --> 09:15.254
- How long down?
- Unknown. Mother found him.

09:15.464 --> 09:18.126
Gave him two rounds of epi,
two of atropine.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.597
- Got any signs of life?
- Got him back once.

09:20.802 --> 09:23.464
Get him on a monitor.
Carter, check ventilation.

09:23.672 --> 09:25.196
- What can I do?
- Rectal temp.

09:25.407 --> 09:26.601
- Great.
- All right.

09:26.808 --> 09:29.470
On my count. Watch your hand there.

09:29.711 --> 09:32.373
One, two, three, go.

09:33.215 --> 09:34.910
Any signs of drugs, suicide?

09:35.116 --> 09:38.381
Said he had a killer headache.
Took a nap and never woke up.

09:38.587 --> 09:41.454
- A subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- Killer headache is right.

09:41.656 --> 09:43.453
- Monitor's up.
- No femoral pulse.

09:43.658 --> 09:46.092
- Asystole.
- No spontaneous respirations.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.627
- No response to pain.
- Anybody got any good news?

09:49.831 --> 09:51.958
Pupils are...

09:52.767 --> 09:55.395
...fixed and dilated.
No corneal reflex.

09:55.604 --> 09:56.730
He's only 18.

09:56.938 --> 10:01.102
Zadro got him back once, maybe we
can do it again. High dose of epi.

10:01.309 --> 10:05.075
Put him on a pulse ox.
An end-tidal CO-2 detector.

10:07.883 --> 10:10.408
- Paddles, please.
- Crank it to 50. Let's go!

10:10.619 --> 10:13.486
- Let's start at 20.
- Twenty? Why?

10:13.688 --> 10:15.519
Because I said so, that's why.

10:15.724 --> 10:16.713
Oh, that's mature.

10:16.925 --> 10:19.052
- Charged to 20.
- Clear.

10:21.029 --> 10:22.496
- How did we do?
- No change.

10:22.697 --> 10:24.028
Fifty? Do I hear 50?

10:24.232 --> 10:26.564
- Let's go to 30.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

10:26.768 --> 10:28.235
Why not just go to 50?

10:28.436 --> 10:32.031
Because he has a sensitive rhythm.
I don't want to overshock him.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.071
- Charge to 30.
- Clear.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.505
Anything?

10:37.045 --> 10:40.037
- Nothing.
- I don't want to question your genius.

10:40.248 --> 10:43.740
But can we go to 50 while I still
got some hair on my chest?

10:44.553 --> 10:46.487
- Let's go to 50.
- It's about time!

10:46.688 --> 10:48.679
- Charged.
- Clear.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.754
That did it.

10:52.961 --> 10:54.292
Back to normal sinus.

10:54.496 --> 10:56.521
Watch him for 15
and then let him go.

10:56.731 --> 10:59.564
Thanks for nothing, Dr. Mengele!

11:02.170 --> 11:03.194
Time?

11:03.405 --> 11:04.531
Twelve minutes.

11:04.739 --> 11:06.969
- Check his rhythm.
- Still no pulse.

11:07.175 --> 11:08.870
- Asystole.
- Keep at it.

11:09.077 --> 11:11.807
Ten of epi onboard.
The boy's mother is in Chairs.

11:12.013 --> 11:15.278
- She wants to talk to someone.
- Carter, you want to do that?

11:15.483 --> 11:17.007
Don't get her hopes up.

11:18.420 --> 11:21.218
All right.
Give me another epi, 7 milligrams.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.388
- Mrs. Richards?
- My son?

11:24.593 --> 11:26.083
Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.159
Your son's heart stopped beating.

11:28.363 --> 11:30.763
We're doing everything
to start it again.

11:30.966 --> 11:33.332
We're giving him medicine
and doing CPR.

11:33.535 --> 11:36.436
Why would his heart stop?
He's 18 years old.

11:38.607 --> 11:41.132
There's a sign that he had
a brain hemorrhage...

11:41.343 --> 11:43.675
...which could've
caused the cardiac arrest.

11:43.878 --> 11:45.709
How? He's the picture of health.

11:45.914 --> 11:50.010
It could be a weak artery, possibly
something that's existed since birth.

11:50.685 --> 11:52.915
The thing is,
he's been down a long time.

11:53.121 --> 11:57.854
The longer he goes without oxygen,
the less likely we can bring him back.

11:58.059 --> 12:01.756
- We might need to have a conversation...
- Please don't give up on him.

12:02.564 --> 12:04.395
He's all that I have.

12:06.901 --> 12:08.266
Please.

12:09.004 --> 12:10.062
Okay.

12:11.506 --> 12:12.700
I'll be back.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.405
Hold it. Hold the compressions.
Any sign of a rhythm?

12:19.614 --> 12:21.411
- Flatline.
- Let's call it.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.345
Not yet. Keep bagging.

12:23.918 --> 12:26.011
You got a reason to keep flogging him?

12:26.221 --> 12:29.349
He's 18, his mother's only child.
And it's Christmas.

12:29.557 --> 12:31.684
Want a miracle?
He's been down for 40.

12:31.893 --> 12:34.589
- So, what's five more?
- Okay, doctor. Let's go.

12:34.796 --> 12:38.755
Resuming compressions. Keep bagging.
And another round of high-dose epi.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.527
Start a dopamine drip.
Get those paddles ready.

12:41.736 --> 12:44.068
- He's in asystole.
- He may be in fine V-fib.

12:44.272 --> 12:46.331
Charge to 300. No, 350.

12:46.541 --> 12:50.170
- Charging.
- Let's hold a really positive thought.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.278
- Ready.
- Clear!

12:52.614 --> 12:53.945
- Was that a beat?
- My God!

12:54.149 --> 12:57.243
- Two beats does not a rhythm make.
- Slap some pads on him.

12:57.452 --> 12:58.851
All right. Here you go.

13:01.089 --> 13:02.181
Can you roll him?

13:05.460 --> 13:07.690
- Set it at 80.
- You're on.

13:08.863 --> 13:11.263
- It's not capturing.
- Dial up the gain.

13:11.866 --> 13:14.494
Come on.
Just gotta get it to capture.

13:14.703 --> 13:17.194
- He's throwing PVCs.
- Hold that lidocaine.

13:17.405 --> 13:18.895
Maximum gain.

13:19.574 --> 13:20.632
Come on.

13:20.842 --> 13:21.900
Come on.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.269
- We got it!
- He's got a rhythm!

13:24.479 --> 13:26.071
- Take a carotid.
- Pulse?

13:26.281 --> 13:28.078
- Strong at 120.
- BP is 100.

13:28.283 --> 13:30.615
Send him to CT,
find out where he's bleeding.

13:30.819 --> 13:32.616
- How'd you...?
- I'm an instrument!

13:32.821 --> 13:35.289
- Way to go!
- Hope he's got some brain left.

13:35.623 --> 13:36.612
You want contrast?

13:36.825 --> 13:40.261
No, but call Respiratory.
Make sure they got a vent and scanner.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.660
Looks like we got our miracle.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.961
If he wakes up. Even if he does,
he'll probably have brain damage.

13:48.303 --> 13:49.327
Carter.

13:50.138 --> 13:51.696
Better prepare the mother.

14:00.281 --> 14:01.680
Yes, Ma.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.646
Of course we're coming.

14:05.587 --> 14:09.819
Uncle Ted wants Doug to play
"Silent Night" on the tambourine?

14:10.859 --> 14:12.656
I think he'd love it.

14:13.394 --> 14:17.023
Yeah. Hey, do you have
any videotape left in the videocam?

14:17.232 --> 14:19.666
Yep. Yes, I am coming to Mass.

14:19.868 --> 14:23.895
No, he is not. But, you know what?
We should probably respect his choice.

14:24.105 --> 14:26.335
It would be nice
if we all went together.

14:26.541 --> 14:29.635
If I'm needed,
I'll be out at the roach coach.

14:29.844 --> 14:32.711
I'll be here suffocating
under a mountain of charts.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.680
That's odd. I swear I had
my gloves in my pocket.

14:36.885 --> 14:38.045
Dr. Lee took them.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.515
What did you say?

14:40.255 --> 14:42.246
I saw her at your locker earlier.

14:42.457 --> 14:45.187
- That is ridiculous, Jerry.
- What's ridiculous?

14:45.393 --> 14:47.793
He's accusing Amanda
of stealing my gloves.

14:47.996 --> 14:51.488
I tell you she had your locker open,
and she was very suspicious.

14:51.699 --> 14:54.896
I know you're angry at Amanda
for the new chart system...

14:55.103 --> 14:57.435
...but to accuse her of
being a thief...

14:57.639 --> 14:59.937
You didn't see how weird
she was acting.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.798
Can it, Jerry.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.808
I finished the work on Landis.
How are you?

15:05.013 --> 15:08.847
- Two more preops, then postops.
- You may make your dinner after all.

15:09.384 --> 15:12.717
What'll it be? Goose in
chestnut sauce or roast venison?

15:12.921 --> 15:14.513
We gotta call in our entr Áes.

15:14.722 --> 15:18.852
Dr. Romano, Mr. DeMisa is coming back
in with postoperative pain.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.493
What a pain in the ass!

15:20.695 --> 15:23.163
You assisted on his gastroplasty,
didn't you?

15:23.364 --> 15:26.663
- What? Yeah.
- Great! When he comes in, take him.

15:26.868 --> 15:29.666
I'm already busy.
I'm trying to get home for dinner.

15:29.871 --> 15:32.135
Sometimes being a Resident just sucks.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.570
So, what'll it be?
Mother Goose or Bambi?

15:37.612 --> 15:38.670
Are these leads on?

15:38.880 --> 15:39.972
The leads are on.

15:40.181 --> 15:44.675
Nothing in the alpha, theta or
delta frequencies. He's brain-dead.

15:46.087 --> 15:48.419
Well, maybe he can be an organ donor.

15:48.623 --> 15:53.560
Not too likely. He has type AB blood.
That's, what, 2% of the population?

15:53.761 --> 15:56.559
I doubt you'll find
many compatible candidates.

15:56.764 --> 15:59.858
- It's worth a try.
- Sure it is. Talk to the mother.

16:00.068 --> 16:03.526
If she won't go for it,
try to persuade her to pull the plug.

16:05.740 --> 16:07.674
So much for my miracle.

16:08.309 --> 16:10.903
Dr. Corday, the fertility
clinic just called.

16:11.112 --> 16:14.013
Your patient, David Gardner,
is having an MI.

16:14.215 --> 16:17.480
His EKG was normal this morning.
Is he upstairs?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.585
They're taking him to the ER.

16:20.288 --> 16:21.653
Okay.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.216
I just took an unusual complaint.

16:25.426 --> 16:29.260
An irate elf claims you tortured him
with the cardioversion paddles?

16:29.464 --> 16:33.560
We differed over treatment strategies.
I wouldn't quite call it torture.

16:33.768 --> 16:36.760
I know. I read the chart.
He's clearly a nut case.

16:36.971 --> 16:39.963
- I'm just making sure you're all right.
- I'm okay.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.367
Although, to be honest,
I could've handled it better.

16:43.578 --> 16:47.480
I'm a little off my game today.
Blame it on the holidays.

16:47.682 --> 16:50.549
- Is it a rough time of year for you?
- Not usually.

16:50.752 --> 16:55.553
My ex-wife, she sent out this
newsletter saying how happy she is.

16:55.757 --> 16:59.659
I can't help but see it as her saying,
"Look how well I traded up."

16:59.861 --> 17:01.556
- I got it.
- Thanks.

17:01.763 --> 17:04.630
- It's a tough time of year for me too.
- Really?

17:04.866 --> 17:08.461
This is the first Christmas
since my brother committed suicide.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.433
Oh, jeez! I'm sorry.

17:10.637 --> 17:11.627
Yeah.

17:11.973 --> 17:15.932
It was one of those apocalyptic cult
things. The guys with the sneakers?

17:16.144 --> 17:19.739
Oh, yeah. I thought that
was a couple of years ago.

17:20.013 --> 17:23.244
He missed the big event,
so he decided to follow on his own.

17:23.685 --> 17:28.348
Wow! Sorry. I gotta say you're
handling it better than I would've.

17:28.556 --> 17:31.354
I credit that to my Grandma Lee.
She always said:

17:31.559 --> 17:34.357
"Whatever life throws at you,
greet it with a smile.

17:34.562 --> 17:37.497
There's nothing as contagious
as a positive attitude."

17:38.099 --> 17:41.591
I think we'd all be better off
if we followed Grandma's advice.

17:42.370 --> 17:43.359
Here we go.

17:43.571 --> 17:44.560
Coming through.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.003
- Let's get him into Trauma 1.
- Mr. Gardner, how are you?

17:48.209 --> 17:50.234
My chest feels tight.
I can't breathe.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.571
Is he your patient?

17:51.779 --> 17:54.077
Yes, and he's hyperventilating
like crazy.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.513
Hook him up to a 12-lead EKG
and a pulse ox. Start a line.

17:57.719 --> 17:58.845
Get a mask on him.

17:59.053 --> 18:03.012
We need to get your breathing under
control. Concentrate on the breaths.

18:03.224 --> 18:05.658
Let the breath out slowly.

18:05.860 --> 18:07.760
Slowly.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.623
- Monitor's up.
- All right.

18:09.831 --> 18:12.595
Yep, pulse is up to 99.
That's a good sign.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.290
You're gonna be fine.

18:14.502 --> 18:17.164
Breathe in on the count of five.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.361
One.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.129
Two.

18:20.341 --> 18:22.036
Oh, my! You're David...

18:22.243 --> 18:25.542
You're David Gardner, right?
The trumpet soloist?

18:25.747 --> 18:28.807
I saw your guest performance
with the Chicago Symphony.

18:29.017 --> 18:31.815
I'm sorry. I'm Kerry Weaver,
season ticket holder.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.544
Breathe out.

18:33.755 --> 18:37.555
I just loved your featured
performance in Mahler 2.

18:37.759 --> 18:39.351
It gave me shivers.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.857
Slowly.

18:41.062 --> 18:43.121
- Where do you go next?
- Boston.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.959
- Breathe in.
- The BSO! Yes!

18:46.167 --> 18:48.158
- I got your 12-lead.
- Breathe out.

18:48.369 --> 18:52.396
David, your heart looks just fine.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.202
We'll run a few tests
just to make sure.

18:55.410 --> 18:59.039
But I think that you were
just having an anxiety attack.

18:59.247 --> 19:01.841
Are you a bit nervous
about playing for Ozawa?

19:02.216 --> 19:04.241
Breathe in.

19:04.485 --> 19:06.214
How long have you had the pain?

19:06.421 --> 19:09.288
Ever since the surgery.
I wish I'd never had it.

19:09.490 --> 19:13.551
I heard stapling my stomach would help
me reduce, but I haven't lost a pound.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.252
Have you been sticking
to the all-liquid diet?

19:16.631 --> 19:19.156
- What did you have today?
- A little blended tea.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.595
What was in it?

19:21.102 --> 19:22.194
Bacon and eggs.

19:22.403 --> 19:23.427
Mr. DeMisa!

19:23.638 --> 19:25.230
But I blended it up.

19:26.574 --> 19:29.168
- What else did you have?
- A smoothie.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.870
And what was in that?

19:31.345 --> 19:33.074
Low-fat milk...

19:33.548 --> 19:34.810
...some butternut squash...

19:35.016 --> 19:37.610
...sweet potato pancakes,
a honey-glazed ham...

19:37.819 --> 19:40.811
...and a caramel-orange Buche de Noel.

19:41.022 --> 19:44.981
- That's a full Christmas dinner.
- Oh, also, I'm a little backed up.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.957
- What do you mean a little backed up?
- Constipated.

19:49.163 --> 19:52.030
Okay. He probably busted a staple.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.293
Set him up for a gastrograph
and give him a laxative.

19:55.503 --> 19:58.563
I like the chocolate ones.
If that's all right?

20:04.278 --> 20:05.768
Dr. Carter...

20:06.614 --> 20:09.879
...I was talking to Steven
and he moved his arm.

20:10.985 --> 20:13.317
He's having involuntary muscle spasms.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.222
I think he was trying
to tell me something.

20:17.158 --> 20:19.388
I'm afraid that's not possible.

20:20.194 --> 20:25.063
We did a test on Steven to check for
brain activity. We didn't find any.

20:27.902 --> 20:29.301
Well, then...

20:30.171 --> 20:32.332
...it'll take some time and...

20:32.540 --> 20:34.872
Time isn't going to help.

20:35.643 --> 20:37.611
Steven is brain-dead.

20:37.912 --> 20:39.504
No possibility of recovery.

20:40.181 --> 20:43.947
I know this is a really difficult
thing to think about right now.

20:44.152 --> 20:46.780
One way to salvage something
positive out of this...

20:46.988 --> 20:48.683
...is to donate Steven's organs.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.320
No, I...

20:53.895 --> 20:57.763
I can't let you take out his organs
when his heart is still beating.

21:01.202 --> 21:03.500
If that's the case, I'd ask you...

21:03.704 --> 21:07.196
...to consider signing
a "do not resuscitate" order.

21:08.042 --> 21:11.170
That way, if Steven's heart
fails again...

21:11.746 --> 21:15.045
...we won't subject him
to overly aggressive procedures...

21:15.249 --> 21:18.218
...by prolonging his life
in a vegetative state.

21:19.020 --> 21:21.045
I can hope for a miracle, can't I?

21:25.426 --> 21:27.018
Well, who do we have here?

21:27.228 --> 21:30.163
Mrs. Hutton fainted
while shopping at Lakewood Mall.

21:30.364 --> 21:34.391
I'm sorry. Don't worry, we'll have
you back on your feet in a jiff.

21:34.602 --> 21:35.967
All right.

21:37.238 --> 21:38.865
You been hitting the nitrous?

21:39.073 --> 21:41.303
You gotta greet life with a smile.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.737
I do?

21:43.110 --> 21:46.477
Yeah. A positive attitude
is contagious.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.241
So why don't you
tell me what happened?

21:49.450 --> 21:52.283
I went to Field's
Night Before Christmas sale.

21:52.486 --> 21:55.978
It was crowded. It was hot.
It was stuffy. I passed out.

21:56.657 --> 21:58.989
- Very nicely put.
- Thanks.

21:59.427 --> 22:03.921
Why don't we order Mrs. Hutton some
cardiac enzymes, CBC and a Chem-7?

22:04.131 --> 22:06.861
Hold it!
How much do those things cost?

22:07.068 --> 22:08.933
Gosh! I don't know.

22:09.170 --> 22:12.264
- You won't tell me?
- No, I mean I really don't know.

22:12.473 --> 22:15.169
- Please sit up.
- Oh, I got your number now.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.812
- Excuse me?
- You think you're pretty smart, huh?

22:19.013 --> 22:23.973
Sweet-talking me into buying all those
expensive tests I don't need.

22:24.185 --> 22:25.948
Just trying to make a diagnosis.

22:26.153 --> 22:28.815
I'm trying to survive
on Social Security.

22:29.023 --> 22:31.048
We can't all make a doctor's salary.

22:31.259 --> 22:33.489
Your insurance will pay for the tests.

22:33.694 --> 22:37.323
Oh, so that's your racket!
Ripping off insurance companies.

22:37.531 --> 22:40.227
It's crooks like you
that keep my premiums so high.

22:40.434 --> 22:41.833
Get me another doctor!

22:42.436 --> 22:44.063
He's the best doctor we have.

22:44.272 --> 22:47.799
Well, I don't like the look of him.
The way he smiles and talks.

22:48.009 --> 22:52.275
I want another doctor!
Any doctor as long as it isn't him!

22:52.480 --> 22:55.608
Mr. Gardner, your labs look stunning.

22:55.816 --> 22:59.718
We should probably wait on the cardiac
enzymes before letting you go.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.445
At this rate, I should
check in for the night.

23:02.657 --> 23:06.149
It would certainly save you
the drive in for surgery tomorrow.

23:06.360 --> 23:10.023
No, the less time I spend here
the better. No offense.

23:10.231 --> 23:11.892
None taken.

23:12.566 --> 23:13.999
So how are you feeling?

23:14.201 --> 23:18.137
Like an idiot. Here I thought
I was having this big heart attack...

23:18.339 --> 23:20.739
...turns out I'm just a nervous wreck.

23:21.042 --> 23:23.306
If you want,
you could postpone surgery.

23:23.511 --> 23:27.003
No. I have to be
recovered by January 15th.

23:27.214 --> 23:30.411
I'm doing a televised special
with the Boston Symphony.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.553
Oh, I'll have to mark my calendar.

23:33.888 --> 23:35.515
Symphony fan?

23:35.956 --> 23:38.925
I know very little
about orchestral music.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.617
So, what do you like?

23:42.296 --> 23:43.490
Well...

23:48.202 --> 23:49.692
...I'm embarrassed to say.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.098
How bad can it be?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.278
I'm in a disco phase at the moment.

23:58.846 --> 24:01.815
Yes, well, I can see why
you would be embarrassed.

24:03.918 --> 24:06.682
- You paged me?
- We've got a problem. He's stuck.

24:06.887 --> 24:09.754
- Stuck?
- He's wedged in. I can't get him out.

24:09.957 --> 24:12.755
- What do you expect me to do?
- Help me get him out?

24:12.960 --> 24:14.552
I don't have time for that.

24:14.762 --> 24:17.162
Have Maintenance
take the chair apart.

24:17.365 --> 24:19.299
- What?
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.058
- You'll have to hold it.
- Help!

24:21.268 --> 24:23.793
- Help me get him out, please?
- Please!

24:24.004 --> 24:26.302
Okay, come on. Grab his arms.

24:27.141 --> 24:28.301
Oh, man!

24:28.509 --> 24:31.307
All right, on my count.
One, two, three.

24:41.222 --> 24:42.621
What a waste.

24:44.492 --> 24:48.155
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
I know... I know better.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.727
You tried to save a life.

24:49.930 --> 24:52.694
I let that "instrument of God"
stuff go to my head.

24:54.301 --> 24:55.791
Maybe it is all arbitrary.

24:56.003 --> 24:58.198
Why does he deserve
a brain hemorrhage?

24:58.406 --> 25:00.533
And why does it blow on Christmas Eve?

25:01.709 --> 25:03.142
What's the point?

25:16.957 --> 25:19.425
I got the tests back
on that teenager in 1.

25:19.627 --> 25:22.152
A little Christmas present
from the stork.

25:22.363 --> 25:25.127
Well, I'd better
go give the good news.

25:25.332 --> 25:27.425
- Oh, my God!
- Here.

25:27.635 --> 25:30.103
Oh, Dr. Weaver, you have to read this.

25:30.304 --> 25:32.704
- Read what?
- A triple-X sex fantasy.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.135
Excuse me?

25:34.341 --> 25:37.242
I found it in Dr. Lee's charts.
It's her handwriting.

25:37.445 --> 25:42.382
"I took M.G.'s gloved hand and placed
it on my heaving pink stippled breast."

25:43.050 --> 25:44.642
Why am I reading this?

25:44.852 --> 25:45.910
Don't you get it?

25:46.120 --> 25:49.055
"M.G." is Mark Greene.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.314
Come on!

25:50.524 --> 25:52.719
What about the glove reference?

25:52.927 --> 25:55.157
You have completely lost your mind.

25:55.362 --> 25:58.422
You found my notes on Mrs. Condrell.
I've looked up and down.

25:58.632 --> 26:02.659
- Mrs. Condrell?
- That psych patient? It's a sad case.

26:02.870 --> 26:05.964
She's psychotic,
extremely hypersexual...

26:06.173 --> 26:10.166
...and has these obsessive fantasies
about Merv Griffin, of all people.

26:10.377 --> 26:11.867
Anyway, thank you.

26:12.613 --> 26:16.572
Next time you want to make an ass
out of yourself, leave me out of it.

26:18.652 --> 26:22.554
- Could there be a mistake?
- No mistake, Laura. You're pregnant.

26:23.657 --> 26:25.318
Oh, God!

26:26.060 --> 26:27.721
What do I do?

26:28.562 --> 26:32.157
- Can you talk to your mother?
- No way. She'll kill me.

26:33.000 --> 26:33.989
Your dad?

26:34.568 --> 26:35.967
- No.
- Thanks.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.797
I had to sneak out even to come here.

26:39.673 --> 26:41.231
Are you gonna tell them?

26:41.442 --> 26:43.273
Not if you don't want me to.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.466
I don't.

26:48.682 --> 26:51.674
You have some choices:
You can have the baby, keep it...

26:51.886 --> 26:55.151
...have the baby, put it up for adoption,
or have an abortion.

26:55.956 --> 26:57.981
I can't have a baby.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.524
There's no way.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.256
Can you help me?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.392
Yes, I can. I'll be right back.

27:08.602 --> 27:11.503
Stephanie, can you...? Thanks.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.206
Hey, Carol.

27:16.210 --> 27:18.235
I got a pregnant
13-year-old in there...

27:18.445 --> 27:20.504
...who wants an abortion
on the holidays.

27:20.714 --> 27:22.682
God! Thirteen.

27:22.883 --> 27:25.283
Well, you think you can arrange that?

27:25.486 --> 27:27.954
Merry Christmas. Yeah.

27:28.155 --> 27:29.713
You can take it from here?

27:29.924 --> 27:31.186
Sure.

27:31.892 --> 27:33.951
Carla, I know his bedtime is at 8:00.

27:34.161 --> 27:36.493
I might not be able
to make it until then.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.222
Yeah, I know.
Listen, listen. Okay, okay.

27:39.433 --> 27:42.231
It's Christmas Eve.
I just want see my son, okay?

27:43.003 --> 27:46.302
Okay. Thank you so much.
I promise. I will. Yeah, bye.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.007
- How's it going?
- Don't ask.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.268
- You call the ER for DeMisa?
- He's still on the toilet.

27:51.478 --> 27:53.912
Lizzie, if you're ready,
we can go together.

27:54.114 --> 27:56.480
I have a couple of patients
to finish with.

27:56.684 --> 28:00.176
- Is Peter trying to ruin our evening?
- No, not at all.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.786
It was a joke.

28:02.156 --> 28:03.953
Look, I'll see you there.

28:04.692 --> 28:07.183
I left these unfinished
dictations for you.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.989
They need to be in by 8.
Appreciate the help. See you later.

28:15.002 --> 28:18.563
16-year-old, unconscious,
history of biliary atresia.

28:18.772 --> 28:20.262
- Hepatic coma?
- Looks like it.

28:20.474 --> 28:23.773
- She was fine until six months ago.
- What medication is she on?

28:23.978 --> 28:27.072
Ampicillin, tobramycin,
vitamins A, D and K.

28:27.281 --> 28:29.078
The skin's jaundiced.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.553
Same with sclera.
Her breath smells sweet.

28:33.754 --> 28:34.812
- Fetor hepaticus?
- Yep.

28:35.055 --> 28:37.956
- What's that?
- Liver's shut down. Dip a urine.

28:38.158 --> 28:41.525
It's getting crowded in here.
Can you deal with the parents?

28:41.729 --> 28:43.959
Start lactulose, 30 cc's per NG.

28:44.164 --> 28:46.598
We're giving her medicine
to clean her blood.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.200
- Blood in the urine.
- She's bleeding inside?

28:49.403 --> 28:52.201
The liver failure's
causing her blood not to clot.

28:52.406 --> 28:53.703
Oh, God!

28:53.907 --> 28:55.807
Is she on the transplant list?

28:56.010 --> 28:59.673
She's been Status 2A for six months.
But they haven't found a match.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.110
- Why not? What's her blood type?
- AB.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.378
What are you doing?
Are you hiding back here?

29:06.587 --> 29:07.849
Exactly.

29:08.055 --> 29:11.582
I tried your grandma's "greet with
a smile" approach on a patient...

29:11.792 --> 29:13.419
...and she threw me out.
- No!

29:13.627 --> 29:14.616
Yep.

29:15.929 --> 29:19.729
I've restricted myself to the
unconscious for the rest of the day.

29:19.933 --> 29:21.696
Now, now.

29:21.902 --> 29:25.463
There's something about me that
brings out the worst in people.

29:25.673 --> 29:26.867
I've noticed that.

29:27.074 --> 29:30.441
I'm like a magnet for negativity.
People get too close...

29:30.644 --> 29:32.908
...I'll pull the positive
right out of them.

29:33.113 --> 29:34.478
- Oh, my God!
- What?

29:34.682 --> 29:36.775
- I suddenly feel sad.
- Low blood sugar?

29:36.984 --> 29:38.508
No. It's definitely you.

29:38.719 --> 29:41.847
Hey, shut the hell up.
I'm trying to sleep here.

29:42.623 --> 29:45.057
Another satisfied customer.

29:45.259 --> 29:48.592
Two kids come in. One's brain-dead,
the other needs a liver.

29:48.796 --> 29:50.696
They're both AB. A godsend!

29:50.898 --> 29:54.425
- The mother won't consent.
- She will when I get through with her.

29:55.135 --> 29:56.830
- Where's his mother?
- Not here.

29:57.037 --> 29:58.527
- Is he throwing PVCs?
- Yeah.

29:58.739 --> 30:00.832
Why didn't you call me?
Get the pacer...

30:01.041 --> 30:02.906
- Can't. DNR.
- What?

30:03.110 --> 30:06.477
- She said you talked her into it.
- There goes your godsend.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.341
- She say where she's going?
- No.

30:08.549 --> 30:10.676
If she comes back, keep her here.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.218
Laura, Dr. Sarafini can take you.

30:17.591 --> 30:18.888
What's wrong?

30:19.993 --> 30:21.858
I just keep thinking.

30:22.796 --> 30:24.354
It's a mortal sin.

30:25.999 --> 30:27.091
Do you believe that?

30:27.301 --> 30:30.202
It doesn't matter what I believe.
What do you think?

30:30.771 --> 30:32.204
I don't know.

30:34.508 --> 30:37.477
Anyone in your family you can talk to?
A sister maybe?

30:37.678 --> 30:38.770
What about your mom?

30:40.414 --> 30:41.779
She'll kill me.

30:44.685 --> 30:47.051
Look, Laura, this isn't gonna be easy.

30:47.254 --> 30:48.983
But it's a very big decision.

30:50.924 --> 30:55.122
I don't think you know what to do.
You really need to talk to someone.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.594
Can you call my mom?

31:06.206 --> 31:10.700
Yeah. I can. I'll call her.
I'll call her.

31:16.049 --> 31:18.779
- She's not back yet?
- No. He just went into V-tach.

31:18.986 --> 31:20.351
Damn it!

31:22.289 --> 31:23.847
I got a faint pulse.

31:24.057 --> 31:27.754
Give him 50 of lidocaine. Get the
paddles, I'll take responsibility.

31:27.961 --> 31:29.861
Yeah, and I'll lose my license.

31:30.297 --> 31:32.458
- What are you doing?
- I'll code him myself.

31:32.666 --> 31:35.066
- You're crazy.
- You can't ignore her wishes.

31:35.269 --> 31:36.600
You wanted a miracle?

31:36.804 --> 31:41.264
These two kids arriving on
the same day is as close as it gets.

31:41.475 --> 31:43.670
She may not see it the way you do.

31:43.877 --> 31:44.935
I'll bet she does.

31:45.145 --> 31:49.445
- You're only thinking of yourself.
- And a dying 16-year-old girl.

31:50.751 --> 31:52.548
Charging at 200.

31:56.590 --> 31:58.455
Move them. Move them!

31:59.660 --> 32:01.389
- Clear!
- You're both crazy.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.555
- Back in sinus.
- Oh, now you did it!

32:04.765 --> 32:08.132
Page me if he goes south.
I'm going to find his mother.

32:08.869 --> 32:12.270
So which section of the orchestra
are you going out with now?

32:12.706 --> 32:16.608
I've been unattached since
I started the tour. Six months now.

32:16.810 --> 32:20.075
- That's a long time to be on the road.
- Yeah. Sure is.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.976
Swarms of groupies in every city?

32:23.483 --> 32:26.043
Well, a classical soloist
doesn't quite...

32:26.286 --> 32:28.618
...lead the life of a Rolling Stone.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.480
But if I'd known I was gonna
lose my prostate...

32:31.692 --> 32:34.320
...I would have made more
of an effort. Believe me.

32:34.795 --> 32:37.423
Are you still anxious
about the surgery tomorrow?

32:38.565 --> 32:42.524
I was never all that anxious about the
surgery, per se. It was more the...

32:42.736 --> 32:43.725
What?

32:46.306 --> 32:48.900
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

32:51.745 --> 32:55.579
Well, I went up to your clinic
to deposit my...

32:56.984 --> 32:58.417
...DNA.

32:58.952 --> 33:02.444
Of course, they directed me to
the cubicle where they'd set up...

33:02.656 --> 33:04.920
...the specimen jar and the...

33:06.026 --> 33:07.357
...men's magazine.

33:07.628 --> 33:09.027
And l...

33:09.563 --> 33:11.258
And I just kept thinking:

33:11.531 --> 33:15.934
"Well, this is it.
This is my last sexual experience."

33:16.136 --> 33:18.969
And l... Well, you know the rest.

33:20.340 --> 33:25.107
First time in history somebody's had
performance anxiety while by himself.

33:28.782 --> 33:31.751
David, would you like to grab
a bite to eat somewhere?

33:32.853 --> 33:35.947
Yes, Elizabeth.
I would like that very much.

33:36.490 --> 33:40.893
Mr. DeMisa, we got your x-rays back.
They're clear, so you are...

33:41.929 --> 33:43.521
Mr. DeMisa?

33:46.900 --> 33:48.527
Mr. DeMisa?

33:49.336 --> 33:52.533
Takata, have you seen
our 400-pound patient?

33:52.739 --> 33:55.264
- What?
- I'm missing five patient dinners.

33:55.475 --> 33:56.635
Damn it!

34:05.052 --> 34:06.815
- Over here.
- What is it?

34:07.020 --> 34:09.648
Cake crumbs.
Looks like German chocolate.

34:10.424 --> 34:13.188
Mr. DeMisa? Damn it!

34:14.962 --> 34:16.485
He's unconscious.

34:16.697 --> 34:19.495
He vomited. There's at least
a half a gallon here.

34:20.333 --> 34:23.098
No bowel sounds, abdomen's rigid.
He really did it.

34:23.303 --> 34:24.827
- He blew a staple?
- Yeah.

34:25.038 --> 34:27.666
- Need a gurney!
- Prep an O.R., get an x-ray.

34:27.873 --> 34:29.808
Get Romano's ass back here.

34:38.150 --> 34:39.641
Mrs. Richards?

34:41.655 --> 34:43.623
I'm sorry to bother you...

34:44.358 --> 34:46.882
...but an extraordinary
thing has happened.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.192
A 16-year-old girl with the exact
same rare blood type as Steven's...

34:51.398 --> 34:53.958
...came into the ER in liver failure.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.596
Now, I can't help but to think...

34:56.837 --> 34:59.567
...that if God meant
for Steven to die tonight...

35:00.173 --> 35:01.765
...at Christmas...

35:02.042 --> 35:05.034
...then it must be
so that this girl can live.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.280
I'm sorry.

35:09.816 --> 35:13.377
But I can't think about
another child's problems right now.

35:14.087 --> 35:17.022
All I want is for my son
to die peacefully...

35:18.692 --> 35:20.717
...and to be buried whole.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.155
Excuse me.

35:47.421 --> 35:51.289
- Lots of free air under the diaphragm.
- Yeah, he's perfed his stomach.

35:51.491 --> 35:53.118
- Romano?
- I paged him five times.

35:53.326 --> 35:56.454
- Who's on call?
- Guthrie. Just started a Triple A.

35:56.663 --> 35:59.632
BP's dropped to 80 palp.
We can't wait much longer.

35:59.833 --> 36:01.391
He's got a fever.

36:02.169 --> 36:05.002
Give him a gram of cefotaxime,
500 of Flagyl.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.229
Hand me a scalpel.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.307
- You're starting without an Attending?
- He's septic.

36:09.509 --> 36:11.534
We keep him on the table, he'll die.

36:15.849 --> 36:17.749
What the hell? Hey, Carol?

36:17.951 --> 36:21.216
Hey, you see there's a priest
in there with that girl?

36:21.421 --> 36:23.548
He'll pressure her
into having the kid.

36:23.757 --> 36:26.692
- Maybe he'll counsel her too.
- How'd he find out?

36:26.893 --> 36:29.487
She asked me to call her mom.
He came with her.

36:29.696 --> 36:31.596
- I wish you'd told me about it.
- Why?

36:31.798 --> 36:34.130
Because I would've tried
to keep him out.

36:35.869 --> 36:37.427
Are those baked beans?

36:37.637 --> 36:39.104
Yeah.

36:39.306 --> 36:40.933
And French fries.

36:41.141 --> 36:42.165
That's rank!

36:42.375 --> 36:43.637
What's this?

36:43.844 --> 36:45.539
Coleslaw.

36:47.547 --> 36:48.878
Here's a good one.

36:49.216 --> 36:50.649
What's that, mystery meat?

36:50.851 --> 36:53.581
What the hell are you doing
operating on him?

36:53.787 --> 36:55.687
Saving his life.
You jerk.

36:55.889 --> 36:58.221
Get me a gown and gloves now!

36:58.425 --> 37:00.620
Peter, get your hands
out of my patient!

37:00.827 --> 37:03.728
- Give me a little suction here.
- Sucker's clogged.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.864
Yeah. It's a cranberry.

37:08.235 --> 37:09.725
Let's go, Shirley, gloves!

37:12.372 --> 37:14.067
- Where the hell is she?
- Who?

37:14.274 --> 37:17.243
Who do you think?
What'd you do, give her extra work?

37:17.444 --> 37:19.002
What are you talking about?

37:19.212 --> 37:20.076
Step away.

37:21.248 --> 37:23.773
- Fine.
- Who gave you permission to start?

37:23.984 --> 37:27.112
- He was going into septic shock.
- You are a Resident.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.618
You don't take a piss
without permission.

37:29.823 --> 37:32.417
Where the hell's Lizzie?
Off doing your scut?

37:32.626 --> 37:34.491
She left an hour ago.

37:37.364 --> 37:40.094
What'd you use to make this incision?
A chain saw?

37:40.300 --> 37:41.358
He's been drinking.

37:41.601 --> 37:43.466
- What?
- He's drunk.

37:44.604 --> 37:45.935
Go. Call Anspaugh now.

37:47.374 --> 37:48.932
Retract the bowel.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.799
Retract the bowel, please.

37:53.780 --> 37:55.145
Have you been drinking?

37:55.982 --> 37:58.314
Are you questioning
my surgical fitness?

37:58.652 --> 38:01.212
- How many drinks have you had?
- Go to hell.

38:01.421 --> 38:03.889
I'm gonna ask you
to step back, please.

38:04.090 --> 38:05.853
- Sponge.
- Dr. Romano!

38:06.059 --> 38:09.222
- Touch me again, I'll deck you.
- Look, you're drunk!

38:14.768 --> 38:17.931
All right, Shirley.
Get me some clean gloves and a gown.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.497
Coming right up.

38:21.174 --> 38:23.335
- Who ordered all this stuff?
- What is it?

38:23.543 --> 38:26.944
Pizza, beer, brandy,
whole bunch of spices...

38:27.147 --> 38:29.707
The provisions have arrived.
How much do I owe?

38:29.916 --> 38:31.611
$212, plus a tip.

38:31.818 --> 38:33.649
- What's going on?
- Christmas party.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.754
- I didn't know there was one.
- There is now. My treat.

38:36.957 --> 38:40.552
It's really crowded. Can we take
this stuff into the lounge?

38:40.760 --> 38:42.250
Grouch.

38:42.963 --> 38:44.430
Thanks, guys.

38:44.831 --> 38:47.766
Remember to punch out
before boozing. Thanks.

38:48.134 --> 38:50.728
- Why do we need brandy and spices?
- Hot toddies.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.872
- Sultan of Jahore's favorite.
- Lf it's good enough for him...

38:54.074 --> 38:55.632
Yeah, make mine a double.

38:55.842 --> 38:59.505
- Jerry, where's my lab coat?
- It was here a minute ago.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.340
Where did it go?

39:01.548 --> 39:05.382
- I don't even want to hazard a guess.
- That's a wise choice, Jerry.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.045
I admit it.
There's no such thing as miracles.

39:10.257 --> 39:12.088
You don't really believe that.

39:12.826 --> 39:14.817
I don't know what I believe.

39:15.028 --> 39:17.292
I was so sure that I was right.

39:18.198 --> 39:20.723
That I had the Big Kahuna on my side.

39:21.268 --> 39:23.566
- That's pretty arrogant, huh?
- Very.

39:28.541 --> 39:29.530
What's going on?

39:29.743 --> 39:33.270
Apparently, Mrs. Richards bumped
into the Mikamis in the hallway...

39:33.480 --> 39:35.004
...and they got to talking.

39:36.883 --> 39:39.249
She consented to the liver transplant.

39:39.452 --> 39:41.181
Oh, my God!

39:43.223 --> 39:46.556
Before you give Him all the credit
you should know something.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.819
- What?
- I introduced them.

39:51.164 --> 39:54.031
What do you know?
You're an instrument of God.

39:54.367 --> 39:55.356
Oh, please.

40:03.743 --> 40:05.108
Sorry.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.579
How sorry?

40:09.149 --> 40:10.377
Well...

40:14.521 --> 40:18.821
Not sorry enough to go to Mass
tonight, if that's what you mean.

40:19.993 --> 40:21.654
What I don't understand is...

40:21.861 --> 40:27.094
...how I can care so much for a
hot-tempered, pig-headed heathen.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.200
I'd prefer "pagan."

40:33.573 --> 40:34.870
Heathen.

40:42.615 --> 40:44.810
I'm finishing up
my disciplinary report...

40:45.018 --> 40:46.918
...recommending you be terminated...

40:47.120 --> 40:49.418
...for operating without an Attending.

40:49.622 --> 40:53.023
- You turn that in, I'll defend myself.
- Well, good luck, Peter.

40:53.226 --> 40:57.287
I'll have to turn in these labs
showing your blood alcohol was.12.

40:57.497 --> 41:00.466
You shouldn't have been driving,
let alone operating.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.727
Don't bluff me, Peter.
You didn't draw my blood.

41:04.971 --> 41:06.370
Not from there.

41:19.252 --> 41:20.742
Mark, look here!

41:21.087 --> 41:23.555
- Gotcha.
- These hot toddies are delicious.

41:23.757 --> 41:25.384
- I want the recipe.
- No problem.

41:25.592 --> 41:29.426
Hey, Jerry. Want to try one
of Dr. Lee's hot toddies?

41:29.629 --> 41:31.563
Just give me a beer.

41:39.639 --> 41:41.470
- Christian soul out of this world.

41:41.674 --> 41:44.575
In the name of God the Father
who created you.

41:44.778 --> 41:47.269
In the name of Jesus Christ
who redeemed you.

41:47.480 --> 41:50.210
In the name of the Holy Spirit
who sanctifies you...

43:46.399 --> 43:48.594
Merry Christmas, Amanda.
