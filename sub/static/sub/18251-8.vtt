WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:04.238
Hey!

00:04.272 --> 00:05.606
There he is!

00:05.639 --> 00:07.075
I can't believe
you're here.
Yeah.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.009
How's it going?
How are you liking Sweden?

00:09.043 --> 00:10.578
Uh... I'm not.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.181
Really?
It's like Seattle,
but more depressing.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.748
You think this
is depressing?

00:14.782 --> 00:17.017
This is like,
literally,
the best day of
the year so far.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.386
This day?
Yeah.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.988
I had to wear
a jacket on the
way over here.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.257
A jacket in the spring.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.526
Bruce, come on.
Oh my god, if you think
this is bad

00:25.559 --> 00:27.095
you should see it
in the winter time.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.530
Oh, I'm never going
to see it in the winter.
(Wheezing chuckle)

00:29.563 --> 00:32.133
If you live in a country
where the sun never shines,

00:32.166 --> 00:34.202
that is God's way
of telling you
you should move.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.137
I don't know,
I think it's
kind of nice.
Hmm.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.206
There was a moment
this winter

00:38.239 --> 00:40.641
when the sun kind of
reflected off the snow

00:40.674 --> 00:43.777
and it was just
really beautiful.
Wow.

00:43.811 --> 00:47.248
So why are you here?
Well, I have a
speaking engagement

00:47.281 --> 00:50.718
and I'm receiving an award:
"Mother of the year".

00:50.751 --> 00:53.321
Wow! Congratulations!
Yeah.

00:53.354 --> 00:57.158
So I have to do a Q&A
after with some kids.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.260
And I need to be
stoned for that.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.329
Can you get
me some weed?
Sure.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.497
Should be easy
in Sweden, right?
Yeah, I mean,

01:03.531 --> 01:05.333
it must be everywhere,
I'm guessing,
in this country.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.601
Very progressive
and Sweden is
so liberal, so.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.837
Yeah, I'm assuming
Sweden just hands it
out at the library.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.640
You know, I think
Vikings were the
original hipsters.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.208
Really?
Yeah, I read that,

01:14.242 --> 01:17.145
somewhere.
I bet women get
equally paid in weed.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.712
I'll get it from
the government,
or something.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.448
Great.
Yeah. No problem.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.417
So that's it?
That's all you wanted?
Yeah, oh, and, uhm...

01:23.451 --> 01:24.818
take a look at this.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.720
I had to sign
a contract.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.622
Just want to make sure
this is legit.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.358
Okay, I'm not
a lawyer.
You're not?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.260
What are you?
I'm an accountant.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.229
I was an... I was your
accountant, by the way.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.831
Oh my god, Bruce,
I don't care!
Just look at it.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.233
(Sighing)

01:39.267 --> 01:40.968
Take a look at how much
I'm getting paid.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.272
50 grand.
It says "50 000
crowns", actually,

01:44.305 --> 01:46.174
Swedish Krona.
What?

01:46.207 --> 01:47.741
That's, like, $6000.

01:47.775 --> 01:51.745
I flew all the way
here to do this event
for $6000?

01:51.779 --> 01:54.182
Exactly.
That's how much I pay
for my bath towels.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.950
Sorry.
Oh, I knew
I was getting screwed.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.553
Speaking of,
I Googled your prince,

01:59.587 --> 02:01.655
and I'd like you to set up
a meeting with him.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.357
I don't think
I can do that, actually.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.893
How hard can it be?
Just call the castle
and ask for the prince.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.262
I think I should focus
on the weed thing.
Yes, fine.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.030
You focus on the weed,

02:10.063 --> 02:12.266
and I will go
get your prince.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.834
Okay, deal.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.270
So... what else
has been going on?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.506
What? Chop chop.
I'll just get the weed.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.175
Right, yeah.
(Music)

02:21.209 --> 02:24.044
* We're not living in America

02:24.077 --> 02:27.581
* But we're not sorry

02:27.615 --> 02:29.317
* I knew there was something

02:29.350 --> 02:31.419
* That we never had

02:31.452 --> 02:34.355
* We don't worry

02:34.388 --> 02:37.658
* No, we're not
living in America *

02:37.691 --> 02:41.495
* But we're not sorry, no

02:41.529 --> 02:44.898
* We don't care
about the world today *

02:44.932 --> 02:47.668
* We're not sorry

02:47.701 --> 02:49.370
* For you

02:50.838 --> 02:54.975
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

02:55.008 --> 02:56.009
* Aahh

02:57.245 --> 02:59.713
So I'm on part time
sick leave, now.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.982
Right, for almost
hitting the wall.
Yes.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.051
Okay, so the government
is paying you

03:04.084 --> 03:06.854
to stay home
half of the time?
Yeah.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.290
Sounds amazing!
I wish I could
hit the wall,

03:09.323 --> 03:11.024
I wish I could, like,
smack right into it.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.760
I mean, I officially
work half time

03:12.793 --> 03:15.363
but I still have
to do all the stuff
I did before.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.798
Okay?
And attend a therapy group

03:17.831 --> 03:19.533
for people who have
hit the wall,

03:19.567 --> 03:23.003
"to learn to cope
with everyday stress".
Okay?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.973
But those meetings
take more hours

03:26.006 --> 03:29.076
from my actual
work time, you know?

03:29.109 --> 03:31.879
So therapy stresses
me out even more!

03:31.912 --> 03:35.015
Okay. But you get paid
for that stress.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.451
No, I don't.
Oh god, I thought
I understood it

03:37.485 --> 03:38.886
but now I'm more
confused than ever.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.955
Tack.
Thank you.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.524
Hey, do you know
where I can get
any weed by the way?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.725
Sshhh!
What?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.660
You can't say that
out loud, here.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.562
Can't say weed...
No, but!

03:48.596 --> 03:50.464
There's a very
different attitude
towards that here.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.199
Towards weed?
It's...

03:52.232 --> 03:53.434
It's a drug.
(Chuckling)
Okay.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.168
But it's an accepted
drug, like...

03:55.202 --> 03:57.070
aspirin or
cough medicine.
Not really.

03:57.104 --> 04:01.241
It's all the same here,
weed, cocaine, heroine,

04:01.275 --> 04:03.511
no difference.
What about alcohol?

04:03.544 --> 04:06.280
We make an exception
for alcohol, because...

04:06.314 --> 04:08.716
We do.
Well, it's not for me,

04:08.749 --> 04:10.884
just so you know,
it's for Amy.
Just say "no".

04:10.918 --> 04:14.288
It's not easy to say
"no" to her, she's...
You can get arrested.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.557
If I get arrested
I would just call
Mrs. Evans

04:16.590 --> 04:20.027
to come bail me out.
Why would you call
your mom?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.061
My mom?
(Laughing)

04:21.094 --> 04:22.630
I'm talking
about you, dummy!

04:22.663 --> 04:24.131
The future Mrs. Evans!
(Chuckling)

04:24.164 --> 04:25.599
Oh! So you're
just assuming

04:25.633 --> 04:28.035
I'm going to take
your name, now?
Mm?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.971
Why? I mean, you can
take my last name.
What?

04:31.004 --> 04:33.407
It's really common
in Sweden.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.843
Taking the
girl's name?
Yeah.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.612
Well that's not...
it's uncommon in the U.S.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.915
It's like... none common.
Never happened, actually.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.484
It's not even a thing.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.919
I mean, you want me
to be "Bruce Weak"?

04:45.953 --> 04:49.056
People would be like
"Hey, look at that guy,
oh he's so Bruce Weak."

04:49.089 --> 04:50.624
You're thinking
about it the wrong way.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.192
Think "Bruce Week".

04:52.225 --> 04:54.795
You know, every week
could be a Bruce week.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.996
That's funny, but no!

04:56.029 --> 04:57.431
I would have
to change everything,

04:57.465 --> 05:00.000
I would have to go
to the passport agency,
and my licence,

05:00.033 --> 05:01.569
I'd have to change
the name on...
Yeah, but that's....

05:01.602 --> 05:04.004
what you want me
to do, now.
No, well, yeah,

05:04.037 --> 05:05.739
but it would be
different for you.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.641
Because?
Because...

05:07.675 --> 05:09.577
it's how it's been
done for a long time,

05:09.610 --> 05:11.645
you can't undo history.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.081
I'm not trying to be
like a pioneer,

05:14.114 --> 05:16.350
you know, and be
the first guy,
American guy,

05:16.384 --> 05:17.751
to ever change my...

05:17.785 --> 05:20.521
Let somebody else
take up that fight.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.123
(Stuttering)
You're being...
you're being crazy!

05:23.156 --> 05:24.858
Suggesting this,
like, right now,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.427
I've never seen
you like this.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.828
I just thought
we were going to
come here and eat,

05:27.861 --> 05:29.563
have like a...
like a conversation.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.198
You're just being
like "whaaat?"!

05:31.231 --> 05:35.636
Uh... this was a
topic that I thought
would never even...

05:35.669 --> 05:38.439
be a thing,
like name...

05:38.472 --> 05:39.640
name change?

05:39.673 --> 05:42.610
Because I thought
this was done... settled!

05:42.643 --> 05:44.645
This was, I...
We haven't even talked
about it before.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.013
I know, obviously I just...

05:46.046 --> 05:47.147
(Exhaling)
Oh my god!

05:47.180 --> 05:48.181
(Cash register clicking)

05:49.617 --> 05:52.620
(Speaking in Swedish)

06:02.996 --> 06:03.997
(Register keys click)

06:28.456 --> 06:29.457
Diane: Emma? Knock, knock.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.691
Hi.
So, here's the deal.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.326
We have got some big
American investors

06:33.360 --> 06:35.062
coming in next week.
Okay.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.130
And I think you should be
the one to meet with them

06:37.164 --> 06:39.933
because you are great
with Americans.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.202
I'm great with
one American:
my boyfriend.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.937
And I'm actually
only working part time.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.506
I'm on sick leave.
I'm sorry,

06:45.539 --> 06:48.275
I'm having trouble
with this whole
"sick leave" thing.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.710
Yeah, of course
you have.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.279
I mean, you're American.
You'll never get it.
Okay.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.515
I'll set the meeting, then.
No, Diane! Diane.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.450
Really, I don't think
I have time.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.386
I need to attend
all these therapy
group meetings and...

06:59.419 --> 07:01.822
Emma, this is
so important.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.624
This is about
the bank's image,

07:03.657 --> 07:05.926
and you are blonde
and beautiful!

07:07.427 --> 07:10.964
And smart!
Also... very smart.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.434
Just set the meetings.
(Sinsong)
Perfect!

07:14.468 --> 07:16.203
Oh, and you know what?

07:16.236 --> 07:19.573
If you're feeling stressed,
you should try mindfulness.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.108
It's great.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.444
I have these bracelets, see?
(Clearing throat)

07:24.478 --> 07:25.813
"Be here now",

07:25.846 --> 07:28.081
"be here right now",
if I'm super stressed...

07:28.115 --> 07:29.817
And they work?
Well, I don't know,

07:29.850 --> 07:32.419
I just bought them,
but, I'm here.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.522
Right now.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.990
Okay, I'll set
the meeting.

07:37.024 --> 07:42.696
(Music)

07:42.730 --> 07:44.231
Okay, you're not going
to believe this,

07:44.264 --> 07:48.235
but over here it seems
that weed is considered
to be a drug.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.170
What? That's so stupid.
I know,

07:50.203 --> 07:52.405
It's like trying
to get a hold of
crystal meth
or something.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.807
Wait, really?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.543
You can get me
crystal meth?
No,

07:55.576 --> 07:57.978
I just might not be
able to get you weed.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.080
Oh, come on,
you can't get the drug

08:00.113 --> 08:02.315
that's in the name
of the country?

08:02.349 --> 08:03.884
S-weed-en!
(Chuckling)

08:03.917 --> 08:05.118
That's a good one.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.721
But no, it's just harder
than I expected.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.089
Bruce, if you
can't deliver,

08:09.122 --> 08:10.758
then maybe
you're not The Guy.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.693
I am The Guy!
Well, The Guy

08:12.726 --> 08:14.595
gets the things
for the people!

08:14.628 --> 08:17.731
I have a very
important event
that I need to
be stoned for.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.333
I would hate
for my lawyer
to sue you.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.002
Sue me for what?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.237
You know, service is not
rendered, void contract,

08:24.271 --> 08:26.674
habeas corpus,
force majeure,
I don't know the terms.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.610
Yeah, I don't think
it's illegal to
not get someone weed.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.545
Well, not in this
banana republic

08:31.579 --> 08:33.614
but you're still
a U.S. citizen, right?

08:33.647 --> 08:36.216
I don't think it's illegal
to not get someone weed
in the U.S., either.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.151
Yeah, well you don't
know my lawyer.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.519
He's very tough

08:39.553 --> 08:41.622
and he's often stoned
so he'll understand.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.691
Can I say something
about Sweden?
Sure.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.793
It thinks it's such
a progressive country

08:45.826 --> 08:47.861
and such a champion
of women's rights,

08:47.895 --> 08:49.429
but what about
this woman?

08:49.462 --> 08:50.664
And her rights?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.733
To get and smoke drugs?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.467
Hypocritical.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.070
Okay, I'm just saying
I don't even know
where to look, okay?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.139
Well, if this was
in New York,

08:59.172 --> 09:01.942
we would just go to some
piss-filled back alley

09:01.975 --> 09:03.677
and find some weird guy
with a limp

09:03.711 --> 09:04.912
and hand him
a bunch of money.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.716
Oh god, I miss
the U.S. so much!

09:08.749 --> 09:10.117
(Sighing)

09:10.150 --> 09:11.484
Okay, you know what?
I'll do it.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.186
I'll figure it out.
That's the spirit, Bruce.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.956
Yeah.
And listen,

09:15.989 --> 09:17.390
this water is boring,

09:17.424 --> 09:19.459
so I'm going to go inside
and watch some TV.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.395
I'm on it.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.336
(Speaking in Swedish)

10:05.272 --> 10:07.474
(Inhaling)

10:07.507 --> 10:11.211
(Exhaling)

11:05.298 --> 11:06.299
A-a-a-a-a-ah!

11:26.619 --> 11:30.924
(Music)

11:30.958 --> 11:32.826
Are you meditating?
Yeah, I'm sitting
on a beach...

11:32.860 --> 11:35.628
Gustaf:
Hello?
...and the water
is calm and...

11:35.662 --> 11:37.364
Oh wait, there's
something in there.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.432
Oh, it's a dead therapist.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.701
Listen. I need
your help, guys.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.171
I'm applying for
a job in sales

11:44.204 --> 11:45.873
and I need
to write a VC.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.842
I think it's called
a CV, but... yeah.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.744
Ah, okay.
What is it?

11:50.778 --> 11:54.381
It's a list of all
your work skills
and experience.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.949
Great, that'll be quick.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.185
I have no skills
and no experience.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.988
Actually the key
to a good résumé is
just to exaggerate.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.455
Like, when you were
a kid, did you ever

12:02.489 --> 12:04.491
sell lemonade
on the side of the
road or something?

12:04.524 --> 12:08.128
No, Bruce!
I sold berries.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.729
Okay, well,
same concept.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.899
Okay? Use that.
I wouldn't mention
the berry thing

12:11.932 --> 12:14.401
but you can say
you have sales experience

12:14.434 --> 12:17.604
and that you're good
with customer relations.
Brilliant.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.140
Okay, I've heard enough.
I'm taking a shower.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.877
(Speaking low)
Hey, come here for a sec.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.112
I want to ask
you something.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.950
Hey, do you know where
I can get any weed
by any chance?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.119
Yeah, I know a place.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.220
You do!

12:33.253 --> 12:40.460
(Music)

12:40.493 --> 12:42.896
These people are
all like you, Bruce.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.631
What do you mean
"like me"?

12:44.664 --> 12:46.533
Narcotics Anonymous.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.635
Bruce:
Narcotics Anonymous?
Yep.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.703
Gustaf, I don't have
a drug problem, okay?

12:50.737 --> 12:53.340
I just need weed,
immediately.
Classic.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.242
You're still in denial.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.378
Don't worry, Bruce,
it's "amonymous".

12:58.411 --> 13:00.313
"Anonymous".
That's what I said.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.417
(Speaking in Swedish)

13:06.219 --> 13:08.455
Do you guys
speak English, or...?
A little.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.723
Great. You used to
take drugs, right?

13:10.757 --> 13:12.960
Yeah, I've been
to some pretty bad
places in my life.

13:12.993 --> 13:16.563
Okay, so where were
those bad places?
Was it...

13:16.596 --> 13:18.098
What do you mean?
I mean like,
specifically,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.867
was there like an area
or a street...

13:19.900 --> 13:21.601
No, no, no,
my wife left me

13:21.634 --> 13:23.503
and my kid didn't want
to see me anymore.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.605
Ohh.
That's when I hit
my rock bottom.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.541
Right. Where was
your rock bottom?
Was it like...

13:28.575 --> 13:30.810
I don't want
to talk about it.
What's your story?

13:30.844 --> 13:35.382
Same. Yeah, I used to buy
a lot of drugs, from...

13:35.415 --> 13:37.117
Mainly actually
from one guy.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.620
I don't know if
you know him, he used
to sell to anyone.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.189
He was well known
for just...

13:42.222 --> 13:44.257
whoever was walking by
he would just give it...

13:44.291 --> 13:46.159
Do you know him...?
Big guy?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.727
He was... I don't know,
you tell me.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.962
If you said the name
I would know it,

13:48.996 --> 13:50.864
it was like...
something Swedish,

13:50.898 --> 13:53.466
like... mmmm...

13:53.500 --> 13:55.903
Anders...?

13:55.936 --> 13:58.171
Mmmm...

13:58.205 --> 13:59.739
Mats?
Mattias?

13:59.772 --> 14:01.975
Mattias, yes!
Ah! Yeah!

14:02.009 --> 14:03.877
Oh yeah, how is he?
Is he still...?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.278
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's still?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.214
Yeah, on the
same spot.
Same spot!

14:07.247 --> 14:08.581
Yeah, yeah.
Okay good, 'cause...

14:08.615 --> 14:10.683
I have a map here so,
do you know where the...

14:10.717 --> 14:12.953
Yeah, yeah, it's there.
Close to the water.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.354
Yes!
Yeah.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.989
God, well I'll be
sure to stay away
from there, then.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.057
Yeah, you do that.
Whoo!

14:17.090 --> 14:19.692
Yeah.
Mattias... Thanks!

14:19.726 --> 14:21.228
Gustaf:
What's happening?
Bruce: I got it.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.595
Gustaf:
You... You're cured?
Bruce: No,

14:22.629 --> 14:24.164
I'm going to buy drugs.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.398
Gustaf:
No, I'm telling you no, Bruce.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.866
Bruce:
It's not for me, Gustaf.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.971
(Speaking in Swedish)

15:49.983 --> 15:51.518
(Typing clicks)

15:51.551 --> 15:52.552
(Woman moaning in video)

15:56.423 --> 15:59.159
Hey there!
Oh! Hi!

15:59.192 --> 16:00.893
Diane:
This is Emma.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.330
This is Larry from
Magnusen Investments.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.232
Oh, hi!
Nice to meet you.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.667
Nice to meet you
too, Emma.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.103
I... I have to say...

16:10.137 --> 16:13.373
it's a very nice view
you've got in these offices.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.410
Okay, have a
good meeting.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.445
Sure!

16:24.851 --> 16:26.553
Hi, are you Mattias?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.121
Who's asking?
Uhm, it's...

16:28.155 --> 16:30.557
I'm just looking
for some, uh...

16:30.590 --> 16:33.860
Jolly Green Giant.
(Chuckling)

16:33.893 --> 16:35.762
Mary-Jane?

16:35.795 --> 16:37.330
Puff the magic dragon...
help me out here,

16:37.364 --> 16:38.765
I don't know the lingo.
What do you guys call it?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.467
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Weed!

16:40.500 --> 16:44.537
I know, I got your name
from a former client
so I know...

16:44.571 --> 16:45.572
I know what you do.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.742
You look like
a cop to me.
A cop?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.379
No... I'm
speaking English.
I'm from America.

16:52.412 --> 16:55.115
That would be the dumbest
undercover move ever,
to be doing that.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.217
Don't they have cops
in America?
They do,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.351
but they have them
in America.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.353
I mean, why would I come
to Sweden to be a cop?

17:00.387 --> 17:01.888
Swedish cops make no
money, that's stupid.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.656
Maybe that's what
you want me to think.
Look at me,

17:03.690 --> 17:04.824
I'm out of shape!

17:04.857 --> 17:07.127
I have no muscles
whatsoever, you know.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.761
I couldn't be a cop,
I'm weak!

17:08.795 --> 17:11.298
I'm Bruce Weak,
that could be my name
actually, soon.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.200
Maybe you're not a cop.
No.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.767
I just need weed.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.570
So, do you have any, like,
really inexpensive stuff?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.406
(Music)

17:20.740 --> 17:22.242
Some of the data
you're asking for,

17:22.275 --> 17:23.743
we can't give you.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.645
You can't give me...

17:25.678 --> 17:27.214
Sir, I've checked
with legal

17:27.247 --> 17:29.816
and we're actually
prohibited by law to...
Excuse me,

17:29.849 --> 17:32.719
is there someone else
with more experience
in the office

17:32.752 --> 17:34.321
I can speak with?
No!

17:34.354 --> 17:36.423
I'm the right
person to talk to.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.559
Obviously not.
You don't seem to know
what's at stake here.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.128
Okay, sir, sir!
Calm down.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.029
I think you're in a lot
of stress right now...

17:43.062 --> 17:45.365
I'm not stressed
in the least.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.135
I'm very frustrated.
You know what?

17:48.168 --> 17:50.470
I think you're
under a lot of
stress right now,

17:50.503 --> 17:52.339
so just take
deep breaths

17:52.372 --> 17:54.073
and imagine that
you're on a beach.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.942
I'm not stressed!

17:55.975 --> 18:00.847
(Yelling)

18:03.150 --> 18:06.153
That's what we call
a pattern breaker.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.620
I'm going to speak
with your boss.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.889
Yeah, but I'm going
to speak to your boss!

18:14.794 --> 18:16.463
(Sighing)
Ah...

18:16.496 --> 18:23.403
(Music)

18:23.436 --> 18:26.439
(Speaking in Swedish)

18:50.763 --> 18:52.632
(Gustaf's phone buzzing)

18:58.405 --> 18:59.806
(Chair scrapes, clatters)

19:08.014 --> 19:10.917
(Speaks in gruff voice)

19:18.191 --> 19:21.728
(Gustaf's voice heard on phone
and from down the hall)

19:43.015 --> 19:45.418
Mission...

19:45.452 --> 19:48.555
accomplished.
Nice, Bruce!

19:48.588 --> 19:50.189
I knew you'd
come through.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.459
Told you.
I'm The Guy.
Hm.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.193
Wow, wait.
Don't open that here!

19:54.227 --> 19:56.629
It smells like
a pizza place.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.698
This is oregano.
It's not oregano, okay?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.668
I paid 2,500 crowns for
that, it's like $350.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.437
This is oregano.
There's no way oregano
could cost that much.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.339
Okay? I'm not
an id... idiot.
Taste it.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.407
I will taste it, god!

20:07.440 --> 20:09.108
Will you be careful
with this?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.979
(Muted chatter of diners,
utensils clinking)

20:14.213 --> 20:15.214
It could...

20:16.283 --> 20:17.484
It's oregano,
you're right.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.719
Yeah, that's
what I said.
Oh, my god.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.654
(Sighing)
You're not
The Guy, Bruce.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.723
I am The Guy.
You know what you are?

20:23.756 --> 20:27.026
The pizza delivery guy.
That's still something.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.497
Get out of here, my date
is going to meet me.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.265
Who's your date?
The prince.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.867
He's going to
take me go-karting.
Cool!

20:34.901 --> 20:35.902
Never met a prince before.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.304
You're not going
to meet one now.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.038
He's not going to hang out
with a drug dealer.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.073
Beat it!
Okay.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.977
(Exhaling)

20:45.011 --> 20:47.547
You told Larry
you were going to
talk to his boss?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.282
Yes, because
I panicked.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.384
Oh my god, when Hans
finds out about this...

20:51.418 --> 20:52.652
Well, what about me?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.687
I am responsible
for this bank's
image. This...

20:54.721 --> 20:57.790
this is like the
Hindenburg crashing
into the Titanic,

20:57.824 --> 21:00.059
and other stuff
that's really bad
for this bank!

21:00.092 --> 21:02.495
You know what?
Maybe we should just
calm down a bit

21:02.529 --> 21:04.931
and do some mindfulness,

21:04.964 --> 21:06.833
you know, be here, now...

21:06.866 --> 21:08.501
Why would I want
to be here now?

21:08.535 --> 21:11.203
This is a nightmare.
I want to get the
hell out of here now!

21:11.237 --> 21:14.841
(Clattering)
Oh, finally, good god!

21:14.874 --> 21:15.975
(Exhaling)

21:18.010 --> 21:19.346
Is that marijuana?

21:19.379 --> 21:21.714
Doctor's orders.

21:21.748 --> 21:22.749
I'm from California.

21:24.551 --> 21:27.119
(Door closing)
Bruce:
Honey, I'm home!

21:27.153 --> 21:29.889
He-ey!
How was your day?

21:29.922 --> 21:32.191
I think I bought
the world's most
expensive pizza spice.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.560
(Cackling)

21:34.961 --> 21:36.996
I... think I'm finished
as The Guy, actually.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.632
Oh, good for you!
(Wheezing)

21:39.666 --> 21:41.701
My day was a mess.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.136
Oh. I'm on full time
sick leave now.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.573
Okay, is that all you're on?

21:46.606 --> 21:47.807
Do you know what Diane does?
(Chuckling)

21:47.840 --> 21:50.943
She smokes weed in her office.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.346
Okay, now I get it.
(Chuckle)

21:53.380 --> 21:55.682
Right. Did she offer you any?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.249
No.
No.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.651
I said... I just
said no, Bruce.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.720
Do we have any more
potato chips?

22:00.753 --> 22:04.424
Yeah.
Coming right up.
