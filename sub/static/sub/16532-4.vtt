00:02.130 --> 00:03.660
Oh, thank god, I smell coffee.

00:03.660 --> 00:06.260
This morning has gotten off
to a bit of a rocky...

00:06.270 --> 00:07.770
Horror picture show.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.500
What did you do to your face?

00:09.500 --> 00:11.840
Just a little color,
to make my eyes pop.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.210
Like yours are now.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.970
Is this how we find out
you're transitioning?

00:15.980 --> 00:17.280
Oh, please don't
pick a young name.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.880
The world doesn't need
a 50-year-old jasmine.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.650
Trust me, this'll look
completely normal on camera.

00:21.650 --> 00:25.150
This just in...
I'm gonna be on the news.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.220
They're doing a segment
on the real-estate market,

00:27.220 --> 00:28.520
and I'm their local expert.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.560
Back to you, claire.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.060
I'm still reeling from the last
time you were on the news.

00:34.060 --> 00:35.890
Newscaster: And while people
have found all sorts of ways

00:35.900 --> 00:38.500
to beat the heat,
one local man is using his head.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.330
Is it warm out?
I hadn't noticed.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.970
Oop. Looks like I need
to re-apply.

00:43.970 --> 00:45.200
To clown college?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.210
Haley, go with him.

00:50.210 --> 00:51.880
Make sure he gets
all that stuff off his face.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.850
I'll pack paper towels
and a squeegee.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.150
Ugh. What is wrong with me?
I feel so fuzzy.

00:56.150 --> 00:59.680
Oh, stop being so hard on
yourself. It's just arm hair.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.520
(sighs) I can't figure out this
crossword puzzle.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.860
I... I think mono
turned my mind to mush.

01:03.860 --> 01:04.989
What's the clue?
Maybe I can help.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.490
(laughs)

01:06.490 --> 01:08.390
thanks, mom.
Feels good to laugh.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.730
What is so funny?

01:09.730 --> 01:11.400
I am a well-read
college graduate.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.730
I think I'm capable of
doing a crossword puzzle.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.070
Okay, professor.

01:15.070 --> 01:18.670
Six-letter word,
archimedes' exclamation.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.040
I don't like you right now.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.740
Ugh. Why can't I get this?

01:22.740 --> 01:24.680
Archimedes' exclamation.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.180
Eureka.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.080
We may never know
the answer to that clue,

01:28.080 --> 01:30.250
but it made me realize
this was my chance

01:30.250 --> 01:32.120
to finally beat
alex at scrabble.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.190
I have never beaten her.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.520
She's not the nicest winner.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.860

"bweakfast."

02:03.720 --> 02:07.080
it's a good thing that we're
taking him to speech therapy.

02:07.090 --> 02:12.120
I want everybody to understand
every single thing he says.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.890
(thick accent) do you want
marmalade on your brioche toast?

02:14.890 --> 02:16.390
Not a clue.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.660
You're probably right to nip
that speech problem in the bud.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.470
Mitchell had a lisp
we let slide.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.230
Now we got a lifetime
of "what if?"

02:22.240 --> 02:23.570
that is so offensive.

02:23.570 --> 02:25.900
A lisp doesn't make you gay.

02:25.910 --> 02:29.510
Being gay makes you lisp.

02:29.510 --> 02:32.340
Well, I finished the video
for my juilliard application.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.810

going to be blown away.

Well, you can always

you copied that from that
play "hamilton," right?

02:59.810 --> 03:01.370
I'm not sure "copied"
is the word.

03:01.370 --> 03:02.710
It's more of an homage.

03:02.710 --> 03:05.210
Well, I homaged it about
two weeks on "jay talking."

03:05.210 --> 03:06.310
you saw that episode, right?

03:06.310 --> 03:08.180
- Okay.
- I rhymed "rice pudding"

03:08.180 --> 03:09.650
with "cuba gooding."

03:09.650 --> 03:12.150
both delicious, by the way.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.720
(sighs) oh, good god.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.490
There are thousands
of "hamilton" parodies,

03:15.490 --> 03:17.390
and half of them
are college applications.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.660
It's okay, papi.
Maybe the people in new york

03:19.660 --> 03:21.490
haven't heard
about "hamilton."

03:21.490 --> 03:24.130
(sighs) the deadline for
early admission is tomorrow.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.960
I'll never come up with
something great by then.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.870
Yes, you will, and I'll help.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.200
You'd do that for me?

03:29.200 --> 03:30.800
Anything for you, kid.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.740
I got to get this kid
out of the house.

03:32.740 --> 03:34.170
All his crazy quirks.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.640
The farther away, the better.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.680
I keep leaving brochures
around for schools at sea.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.680
All right, carb up, buddy.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.810
Tackle these pancakes

03:42.820 --> 03:45.250
like it's fourth and goal
on the one-yard line.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.580
(both laugh)

03:46.590 --> 03:48.200
good one, coach.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.820
Life's more fun when you put
stuff in football terms.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.220
Pancakes, yay!

03:51.220 --> 03:53.360
Oh, uh, we're actually
out of those.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.660
(muffled)
you can have the rest.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.660
No, no! We put some
performance supplements in there

03:56.660 --> 03:58.030
that could mess with
you as a lady.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.060
What else is there?

03:59.070 --> 04:00.870
Well, I'm going to
the store later.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.330
In the meantime,
you can have some fruit.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.570
That's real? I thought
it was just for show.

04:04.570 --> 04:07.100
My star player dwight
has been living with us

04:07.110 --> 04:08.340
ever since his father

04:08.340 --> 04:10.710
was transferred to
an army base in florida.

04:10.710 --> 04:13.080
He's doing his part
for our country,

04:13.080 --> 04:16.380
so I thought I could do
<i>my</i> part for our team.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.519
Who's to say who
the bigger hero is.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.550
I will. He is.

04:20.550 --> 04:23.350
I've had to wake up a half hour
earlier to use the bathroom...

04:23.360 --> 04:25.290
The soldier is the hero.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.920
Ugh.
What are we gonna do?

04:26.930 --> 04:28.260
Oh, sweetie, I know.

04:28.260 --> 04:30.030
- Ready to go?
- Yes! Yes!

04:30.030 --> 04:31.800
Dwight and I are going shopping.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.900
He's gonna help me pick out
some cool new kicks.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.970
Like richard gere taking
julia roberts to the store.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.300
That is right. We watched
"pretty woman" last night.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.040
(giggles)

04:40.040 --> 04:43.440
I guess that would've been
my window to eat something.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.440
Okay, hold still.
You have very deep-set eyes.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.750
In college, they called
my "the raccoon."

04:48.750 --> 04:50.580
although, that could've been
because I climbed in

04:50.580 --> 04:53.750
through the doggy door
at zeta house and stole a pie.

04:53.750 --> 04:54.950
My god.

04:54.950 --> 04:56.890
I'm beautiful.
(laughs softly)

04:56.890 --> 04:59.160
honey, you could do this
for a living.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.320
I have thought about it.

05:00.330 --> 05:02.430
I've been practicing on
people since luke was 3.

05:02.430 --> 05:04.330
Mo-o-o-o-ther nature.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.000
You're not gonna believe
who's behind you.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.630
Rainer shine!
Who?

05:07.630 --> 05:09.800
The weatherman.
Don't you watch the news?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.500
Yeah, at the gas station.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.340
He's coming this way.
Just...

05:13.340 --> 05:14.510
Whoa, careful now.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.070
There's a stipulation
in my contract...

05:16.080 --> 05:17.580
I have to be
the best-looking guy here.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.280
(laughs gushingly)
stop it.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.410
Rainer shine.

05:20.410 --> 05:22.850
It's, just,
s-so nice to meet you.

05:22.850 --> 05:24.250
That isn't your
real name, is it?

05:24.250 --> 05:25.850
Ow, I'm not letting you
behind that curtain.

05:25.850 --> 05:27.450
That's my name,
and these are my teeth.

05:27.450 --> 05:28.520
My name's phil dunphy.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.020
I'm doing a little
real-estate segment.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.460
Could become a regular thing.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.860
This is my make-up
artist/daughter, haley dunphy.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.360
It is a pleasure.
You know, I think

05:36.360 --> 05:38.860
you sold my neighbor's
house... doris jacobs.

05:38.870 --> 05:41.370
Uh, white, mid-century,
big back porch?

05:41.370 --> 05:42.500
That's her.
(chuckles)

05:42.500 --> 05:44.340
I need to wash my hands.
Where's the restroom?

05:44.340 --> 05:45.800
Oh, of course.
You're gonna want to

05:45.810 --> 05:47.970
go down that hallway, push
through the big double doors.

05:47.970 --> 05:49.440
You're gonna see some
air vents on the way there.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.680
It's just past
that cold-air system.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.110
Bring a sweater.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.880
It tends to get a little chilly
in that neck of the woods.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.550
Wow.
Wow.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.680
Nice shooting the breeze
with you, phil.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.380
You too.
Hey, uh, listen.

05:59.390 --> 06:00.620
This might be kind weird,

06:00.620 --> 06:02.450
but would you ever
want to grab a beer?

06:02.460 --> 06:03.390
Sure.
Sounds like fun.

06:03.390 --> 06:04.960
All right!
(chuckles)

06:04.960 --> 06:06.290
here you go. Oh!
C... call me three times.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.460
(chuckles)
I'm kidding.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.130
Just call me once.
Tonight... if you're around.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.200
I'll see if I can squeeze
you into my 10-day outlook.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.800
(laughing)
okay.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.570
<i>Do</i> meet your heroe.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.000
What have you got?

06:19.010 --> 06:20.740
What says to juilliard,
"I'm your guy"?

06:20.740 --> 06:22.840
I look straight
into the camera and say,

06:22.840 --> 06:25.980
"molière, beckett, delgado."

06:25.980 --> 06:27.750
yes, it's bold
to include my own name,

06:27.750 --> 06:29.980
but so is the sheer act
of putting pen to paper.

06:29.980 --> 06:30.880
You're kidding, right?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.050
Why? What's wrong?

06:32.050 --> 06:34.690
It's smug and privileged
and precious.

06:34.690 --> 06:36.190
No art school's gonna want that.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.720
Okay. How about this?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.520
We open on
a blank sheet of paper.

06:39.530 --> 06:42.690
Under a mozart fugue,
we suddenly see a drop of blood.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.160
Is it the admissions committee
slitting their wrists?

06:45.160 --> 06:47.060
(sighs) fine.

06:47.070 --> 06:48.400
The year is 18...

06:48.400 --> 06:50.740
No! You're on
the wrong track here.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.900
They're gonna get
a million applications

06:52.910 --> 06:54.170
from artsy little snots.

06:54.170 --> 06:55.570
You've got to stand out.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.380
When everybody else zigs,
you've got to zoink.

06:58.380 --> 06:59.910
Isn't it "zag"?

06:59.910 --> 07:02.680
Exactly.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.910
Hi. We're back.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.280
I don't know what this is,
but I love it.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.290
There's mud out front,
so dwight insisted.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.720
Apparently, they're not cool
after you get them dirty.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.070
Oh!

07:12.070 --> 07:13.420
Last night, we also watch
"an officer and a gentleman."

07:13.430 --> 07:14.890
yeah, he lift me up
where I belong.

07:14.890 --> 07:16.530
- (laughs) okay.
- Knock, knock!

07:16.530 --> 07:18.300
Yeah.
Hi, ms. Pasternack.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.560
I got to go meet some friends.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.200
- I'll see you guys later?
- Okay. Be careful, dwight.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.530
Here. I brought by
some more liquor bottles

07:23.540 --> 07:24.900
for lily's project.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.740
Wha... wh...
What project?

07:26.740 --> 07:28.540
I don't know.
I caught her going through

07:28.540 --> 07:30.710
my garbage, and she said
she needed liquor bottles.

07:30.710 --> 07:31.980
Well, that's weird.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.310
Anyway, tell her I'll have
a couple more for her tomorrow.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.080
Okay. Bye-bye.
Take care.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.150
She can't baby sit anymore.

07:37.150 --> 07:38.380
What project?

07:38.380 --> 07:39.380
I don't know.
(bottles clank)

07:39.390 --> 07:40.480
we've got a problem here.

07:40.490 --> 07:42.790
Look what I found
under dwight's bed.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.260
Oh.
Oh.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.460
Yeah, it's too bad.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.630
He brought such a great
energy to the house.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.890
Mitchell.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.530
I just need a minute
to process this.

07:55.330 --> 07:58.340
But the bottom line, karen,
is, your viewers should work

07:58.340 --> 07:59.940
with a realtor they can trust.

07:59.940 --> 08:02.970
Someone they can
look in the eye.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.280
Boop!

08:07.280 --> 08:10.610
I'm confused.
You <i> wanted</i> me to see that?

08:10.620 --> 08:13.120
Well, someone there said
I was a real natural.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.250
I can't remember who it was.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.750
Oh, that's right...
Rainer shine.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.320
The cheesy weatherman?

08:18.320 --> 08:21.090
No, the award-winning
meteorologist.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.430
He's the recipient of
back-to-back golden showers.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.930
That cannot be
the actual name...

08:24.930 --> 08:26.000
It's their oscars.
Oh.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.530
Anyway, I gave him my number.

08:28.530 --> 08:29.700
He called.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.040
We're grabbing drinks tonight.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.140
No big deal.
I agree.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.000
Please. We both know
it's a super big deal.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.010
I am happy that you have
a new friend.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.270
Be good to have some guy time.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.110
Yeah. Well...

08:38.110 --> 08:40.880
My makeup.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.480
(sighs)
I have, like, three d's.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.780
Well, it's better than
any report card

08:44.780 --> 08:45.620
you ever brought home.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.480
What are you guys doing?

08:47.490 --> 08:48.720
Skydiving.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.020
Ugh. I see where
he gets it from.

08:50.020 --> 08:53.120
Wake me when it's my turn.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.330
I thought I could finally
beat her because she's sick.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.460
I just want her to lose so bad.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.460
Yeah. So do I.

08:59.470 --> 09:00.830
(scrabble pieces rattling)

09:00.830 --> 09:02.170
cheating?

09:02.170 --> 09:03.670
Are we really doing this?

09:03.670 --> 09:06.640
That smug sister of yours
needs to be taken down a peg.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.570
Ooh! Peg.

09:08.570 --> 09:10.470
Think bigger.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.680
<i>Pegs.</i>

09:11.680 --> 09:13.240
(exhales sharply)

09:13.250 --> 09:15.910
okay, joe, repeat after me.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.550
Red rover, red rover, red rover.

09:19.550 --> 09:22.690
Wed wovah, wed wovah, wed wovah.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.390
Okay, now I want you to try it

09:24.390 --> 09:26.820
with a big smile on your face.

09:26.830 --> 09:30.230
Together:
Red rover, red rover, red rover.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.260
Oh. (chuckles)

09:31.260 --> 09:33.530
I am sorry.
It's just sometimes I feel

09:33.530 --> 09:35.000
like my accent gets a little

09:35.000 --> 09:36.930
[mumbles unintelligibly]
and it's gonna

09:36.940 --> 09:39.040
rub off on fulgencio joseph.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.040
Well, you shouldn't
blame yourself,

09:41.040 --> 09:42.770
if that's what you just said.

09:42.780 --> 09:45.680
I actually have some
exercises that can help you.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.710
Like [stressing consonants]
betty bought a bit of butter,

09:48.710 --> 09:50.710
but found the butter bitter.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.520
(heavy accent)
betty bought a bit 'a bootie,

09:53.520 --> 09:55.920
but da bootie bittah.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.990
Uh...

09:59.360 --> 10:00.620
(dog barking)

10:00.630 --> 10:02.190
this is a pretty bad
neighborhood, jay.

10:02.190 --> 10:03.730
This is the story
that we're telling...

10:03.730 --> 10:05.200
Scrappy young kid,
born into poverty

10:05.200 --> 10:07.030
with the deck
stacked against him.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.300
I have a calligraphy tutor.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.900
Hop out.
I want to start shooting.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.070
Hey, you're staying in car?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.240
I'm gonna drive
alongside and film you.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.340
Go ahead.
It's perfectly safe.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.210
(door locks click)

10:19.210 --> 10:20.580
hey. Did you just
lock the door?

10:20.580 --> 10:21.880
The car does that automatically.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.410
Here.
Try on this hair net.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.920
Isn't this a little
over the top?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.620
Was "stand and deliver"
over the top?

10:26.620 --> 10:27.790
Yes, it was.

10:27.790 --> 10:29.590
Fine, then act angry,
like you're sick of

10:29.590 --> 10:31.220
taking orders
from the white man.

10:31.220 --> 10:32.490
(sighs)
yeah, that I can do.

10:32.490 --> 10:35.230
Walk along that wall,
read from your script.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.130
Go.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.800
(clears throat)
<i>hola!</i>

10:37.800 --> 10:39.560
"welcome to the streets
I call home.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.770
It's tough out here,
so I've had to be tougher.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.900
Because in a place where
violence is currency

10:43.900 --> 10:45.140
and pain
is your best friend..."

10:45.140 --> 10:47.270
okay, this is embarrassing.
Please don't shoot this.

10:47.270 --> 10:48.570
You're doing good!

10:48.570 --> 10:50.740
Hey, pretend like
you're climbing over the wall,

10:50.740 --> 10:52.510
in case we want to say
this is mexico.

10:52.510 --> 10:53.610
Not gonna happen.

10:53.610 --> 10:54.910
Fine.

10:54.910 --> 10:56.150
Here's some spray-paint.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.720
Bubble letter me
something about gringos.

11:00.690 --> 11:01.950
(doorbell rings)

11:01.950 --> 11:05.160
oh, I wonder who that could be.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.360
Oh, officer.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.090
Is there a problem?

11:08.090 --> 11:09.460
I'm here to arrest
dwight bullock

11:09.460 --> 11:11.660
for underage drinking.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.470
We wanted to give lily a chance
to come clean on her own.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.270
Luckily, we have
a friend of a friend

11:16.270 --> 11:17.800
who dresses as a cop for work.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.370
He also undresses
as a cop for work.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.310
Remember, just act upset, okay?

11:22.310 --> 11:23.170
Okay.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.480
Dwight bullock.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.710
I have to arrest you.

11:25.710 --> 11:26.710
(gasps)

11:26.710 --> 11:28.050
you've been a bad boy.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.050
(blubbers)

11:29.050 --> 11:30.550
but I didn't do it!

11:30.550 --> 11:31.820
I'm innocent!

11:31.820 --> 11:34.020
I don't know how that bottle
got under the bed!

11:34.020 --> 11:35.520
Now we're gonna
take it down a notch.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.990
Hold out your wrists.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.860
I've got to take you downtown.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.060
Dwight, I am very
disappointed in you.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.530
There's no more football.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.360
(gasps)
no more school.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.230
Lily, is there anything
you'd like to say to dwight

11:46.230 --> 11:48.830
before he's taken to jail.

11:48.830 --> 11:49.970
I guess.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.000
Martha stewart said
she used the prison time

11:52.000 --> 11:53.140
to work on herself.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.370
That is enough!
W-w-we know

11:54.370 --> 11:55.970
you put the bottle
under dwight's bed.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.410
You owe him an apology
this minute.

11:57.410 --> 11:58.680
It isn't fair!

11:58.680 --> 12:00.340
He eats everything,
he's always in the bathroom,

12:00.350 --> 12:02.380
you're watching movies
with him, shopping with him.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.350
And you two don't even
love me anymore!

12:04.350 --> 12:05.480
- Lily!
- That is not...

12:05.480 --> 12:06.980
Lily, honey!

12:06.990 --> 12:08.350
Do you have the keys to these?

12:08.350 --> 12:11.190
I usually let the person who
hired me find it in my pants.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.690
Well, if that
is the custom, I...

12:12.690 --> 12:14.430
Mitchell.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.700
Oh, my god.
Again?

12:20.700 --> 12:22.700
Small bladder, big brain.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.300
That's why we're tied.

12:27.210 --> 12:29.340
I need a "t,"
an "l," and a "w."

12:29.340 --> 12:31.510
"t," "l"...

12:31.510 --> 12:33.540
Hopefully she's too sleepy
to notice that she got

12:33.550 --> 12:34.750
three w's on her board.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.050
Also, can I take a pee?
(p)

12:36.050 --> 12:38.150
yeah.
Coming right up.

12:41.850 --> 12:42.890
Hmm.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.020
Something wrong?

12:44.020 --> 12:45.690
I texted rainer,
like, three hours ago.

12:45.690 --> 12:46.760
He hasn't responded.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.360
I'm sure he's just
playing hard to get.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.590
It's just weird. We had
such a great time last night.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.030
I bet he's busy.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.800
He's a weatherman
in southern california.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.930
He has to be ready in case

12:54.930 --> 12:56.600
temperatures plunge
below 70 degrees.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.400
For your information, there is
a wind advisory tonight.

12:59.410 --> 13:00.870
In fact, I'm gonna
go take down my chimes.

13:00.870 --> 13:02.870
(cell phone dings)
whoa!

13:02.880 --> 13:04.310
Oh.
Not him?

13:04.310 --> 13:05.610
No. I sold a house.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.610
(laughs)

13:06.610 --> 13:08.380
he's probably
just having dinner.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.650
He could be on a date.

13:09.650 --> 13:10.910
Apparently,
he's quite the player.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.950
Makes sense. That could
charm the pants off...

13:12.950 --> 13:14.420
What the <i> what?!</i>

13:14.420 --> 13:15.290
Hey, dad.

13:15.290 --> 13:16.590
There he is!

13:16.590 --> 13:17.650
(laughs nervously)

13:23.400 --> 13:25.600
what is happening?
Why are you kissing him?!

13:25.600 --> 13:26.960
He dropped some
serious cash at dinner,

13:26.970 --> 13:28.130
so I figured, what the hell?

13:28.130 --> 13:30.270
And you.
How could you do this?

13:30.270 --> 13:31.840
Do what? Actually,
I'm... I'm taking it

13:31.840 --> 13:34.140
kind of slow because
she's your daughter.
Eh.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.910
Yeah, she is,
and she's half your age.

13:35.910 --> 13:36.940
You're despicable.

13:36.940 --> 13:38.980
Oh, come on. Now, listen.
Hi. Claire.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.010
Rainer, come in.
We'll just talk this out.

13:41.010 --> 13:43.410
I would like that because
I... I don't quite understand...

13:43.420 --> 13:44.820
What friendship means?

13:44.820 --> 13:46.950
Look, phil, I...
I want to figure this out,

13:46.950 --> 13:48.750
but right now, I have to
get to chavez ridge

13:48.750 --> 13:49.990
and cover this wind event.
Mm.

13:49.990 --> 13:51.460
You know what?

13:51.460 --> 13:52.990
We're not friends.

13:52.990 --> 13:53.860
Go.

13:53.860 --> 13:55.090
Get...

13:55.090 --> 13:56.160
Phil?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.930
You're being ridiculous.

13:58.930 --> 14:01.430
You really want to leave
things like that?

14:04.670 --> 14:08.640
From now on, we're getting
our weather from tricia tazaki!

14:08.640 --> 14:09.870
(door slams)

14:09.880 --> 14:11.440
(sighs)

14:11.440 --> 14:15.510
(annunciating exaggeratedly)
fred fed ted bread.

14:15.510 --> 14:19.980
Ted fed fred bread.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.850
What am I looking at?

14:21.850 --> 14:26.120
Joe's doctor gave me some
sp-heech exer-cises

14:26.130 --> 14:29.360
to help me speak
more clear-ely.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.800
The problem is I fee-ear

14:32.800 --> 14:36.470
I have forgotten
how I used to talk.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.970
Well, if it's any consolation,
this isn't any worse.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.340
Manny!
Check this out.

14:40.340 --> 14:43.070
I think I took a stab at
finishing your video essay.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.910
Jay: In a world divided
into the haves and have-nots,

14:47.910 --> 14:49.680
a boy was born.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.180
It's tough out here,
so I've had to be tougher.

14:52.180 --> 14:54.220
Jay: On the streets,
you can't trust anyone.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.650
Even your closest compadre
could turn on you.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.890
Please don't shoot!

14:59.660 --> 15:02.060
Every day was
a battle for your s...

15:02.060 --> 15:03.030
(click)

15:03.030 --> 15:04.730
I can't send this to juilliard.

15:04.730 --> 15:05.560
It's all lies.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.330
That's right, manny.

15:07.330 --> 15:10.370
Do not change who you are
or you will lo-o-ose

15:10.370 --> 15:12.670
what makes you spe-cial.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.170
Am I still do-ing it?

15:14.170 --> 15:15.340
They're not all lies.

15:15.340 --> 15:16.870
I hear you the stories
you two tell about

15:16.880 --> 15:18.080
the neighborhoods you lived in,

15:18.080 --> 15:20.110
growing up on
the passenger seat of a cab.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.780
Sure, I put in what
we professionals call "sizzle,"

15:22.780 --> 15:24.620
but this is a part of
who you are.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.620
And it's a lot easier
to root for

15:26.620 --> 15:30.350
than a kid who insists that
72% of his chocolate is cocoa.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.060
It's "cacao."

15:33.060 --> 15:35.960
I believe that
that is his point.

15:38.530 --> 15:39.530
What was that?

15:39.530 --> 15:41.030
How about I ask the questions.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.870
When did you two set up
this little rendezvous?

15:42.870 --> 15:44.130
While I was killing it
on the air?

15:44.140 --> 15:45.140
He called me today.

15:45.140 --> 15:46.100
How'd he get your number?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.300
He said you gave it to him.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.570
That lying sack...

15:48.570 --> 15:49.810
Uh-oh.

15:49.810 --> 15:51.240
(both laughing)

15:51.240 --> 15:54.140
anyway, I dated
my makeup girl for a while,

15:54.150 --> 15:56.110
but, uh, then
she had to leave town.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.720
Oh. Wow. Well, if... if
it's not crossing a line,

15:58.720 --> 16:00.950
can I give you my daughter
haley's number?

16:00.950 --> 16:02.590
Really?
Yeah, she's available,

16:02.590 --> 16:05.090
and she actually
expressed some interest.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.660
Well, I'm definitely interested.

16:06.660 --> 16:08.960
(chuckling) well, then
let's make this happen.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.430
Phil denphy, you are the best!

16:11.430 --> 16:12.930
No.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.000
I thought it was about
a makeup job.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.070
I like him.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.330
He's a good guy.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.770
No, he's not.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.800
He's a <i> great</i> guy.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.410
Dad, run to him.

16:22.410 --> 16:24.340
(inhales sharply)

16:24.340 --> 16:25.940
claire, I'm going out!

16:25.940 --> 16:27.240
(door closes)
uh...

16:27.250 --> 16:28.910
Admit it, it's over.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.250
I'm ahead by 50 points,
and you have two tiles left.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.280
There's got to be something!

16:32.280 --> 16:34.250
I... ugh...
Why can't I see it?!

16:34.250 --> 16:37.590
Six months ago, I was at
caltech, and now... ugh... work.

16:37.590 --> 16:38.820
Relax, honey.

16:38.820 --> 16:40.190
It's just a game.

16:40.190 --> 16:41.260
What if it's more than that?

16:41.260 --> 16:43.460
What if mono permanently
changed my brain?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.330
I've always defined myself
by my intelligence,

16:45.330 --> 16:48.530
and if that's gone, who am I?

16:52.040 --> 16:53.200
A loser.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.140
Luke! No!

16:55.140 --> 16:56.270
We cheated.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.810
Luke and I messed with
the tiles.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.210
What?!
Yeah, it's just that,

16:59.210 --> 17:00.940
you're the smartest one
in the family,

17:00.950 --> 17:02.010
and you always rub it in,

17:02.010 --> 17:03.550
and it doesn't
make us feel good.

17:03.550 --> 17:04.849
Wow.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.380
I am so sorry.

17:06.390 --> 17:09.020
I feel terrible that I've been
making you guys feel this way.

17:09.020 --> 17:11.790
Thank you for opening up
to me about it.

17:11.790 --> 17:15.030
Otherwise, I never would have
known that you cheated,

17:15.030 --> 17:16.460
which means that...

17:16.460 --> 17:19.960
I win, you lose! I win!
You lose! I win! You lose!

17:19.970 --> 17:21.500
I win [panting] you lose.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.230
God, I'm so tired.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.270
If you want to shave off her
eyebrows, I'm cool with that.

17:28.470 --> 17:32.240
Lily, honey, what're you doing?

17:32.240 --> 17:33.710
Okay.
Her first ice out.

17:33.710 --> 17:34.580
Be strong.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.010
G... lily.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.580
All right, all right, come on.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.880
What you did to dwight
was wrong, okay?

17:39.890 --> 17:41.750
We're very disappointed in you.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.850
Yes, and there's
gonna be consequences.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.760
- Mm-hmm.
- No electronics for a week.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.990
That'll be worse
for you than for me.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.730
No dessert.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.230
Okay, that hurts.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.230
That being said,
we could've handled things

17:53.230 --> 17:54.230
a little bit better.

17:54.230 --> 17:55.200
We should've talked to you

17:55.200 --> 17:56.830
before having dwight move in.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.570
You mean I could have
stopped it?

17:58.570 --> 18:01.000
Well, no, but at least
we would've know how you felt,

18:01.010 --> 18:02.410
and we could've made things
easier for you.

18:02.410 --> 18:05.680
Sweetie, look, I, of all people,
know what it feels like

18:05.680 --> 18:07.540
to go from being
the center of attention...

18:07.550 --> 18:09.750
I went through it with
my parents back on the farm,

18:09.750 --> 18:11.010
when they brought home
a seven-pound

18:11.020 --> 18:12.280
little pink
bundle of joy and said,

18:12.280 --> 18:13.520
"you're gonna
share your room..."

18:13.520 --> 18:15.390
we all know it's gonna be a pig.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.550
Anyway, he would snore...
(giggles)

18:17.560 --> 18:19.220
okay, I'm sorry I lied.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.390
(sighs) thank you.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.130
You have to apologize
to dwight, too.
Mm.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.130
I'll try to catch him
in between bites.

18:24.130 --> 18:25.100
Oh!

18:25.100 --> 18:26.430
(chuckles)
hey, I have an idea.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.130
Let's think of something we can
all do together, okay?

18:28.130 --> 18:29.600
Just the four of us.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.700
Anything you want.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.470
Absolutely anything.

18:33.470 --> 18:36.740
Three years ago, they gave me
an "absolutely anything,"

18:36.740 --> 18:38.780
and I wasted it on a popsicle.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.450
That was not gonna happen again.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.550
Well, now, this is
a lovely party.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.550
- Mm.
- It's a splendid afternoon.

18:45.550 --> 18:46.580
More tea?

18:46.590 --> 18:48.120
No thanks.
My cup is still full.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.290
No, it isn't.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.150
But I didn't drink it all.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.720
Just take the tea.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.460
(wind howling)
anyway, after
the lightning strike,

18:53.460 --> 18:55.290
I had the perm for,
like, two years.

18:55.290 --> 18:56.330
How's that?

18:56.330 --> 18:57.260
Rainer!

18:57.260 --> 18:58.500
Phil.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.060
What are you doing here?

19:00.070 --> 19:01.470
You're not one of those
storm chasers, are you?

19:01.470 --> 19:04.070
Not since the movie "twister"
exposed how cutthroat it is.

19:04.070 --> 19:05.300
I came here to apologize.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.570
Oh, you don't have to do that.

19:06.570 --> 19:07.770
Yes, I do.

19:07.770 --> 19:09.510
I was confused,
and I said a bunch of stuff

19:09.510 --> 19:10.510
that you didn't deserve.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.280
It did hit me,
right around the mid-section.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.610
Listen, haley's old enough
to make her own decisions.

19:16.620 --> 19:20.450
I really like her, but if dating
her is gonna be a problem...

19:20.450 --> 19:23.020
I don't love
the 25-year age difference.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.160
It's actually 20... 2...

19:25.160 --> 19:26.320
22.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.260
Le... I would just
hate to think

19:28.260 --> 19:30.590
that dating her meant
that you and I

19:30.600 --> 19:33.600
still couldn't be,
you know, friends.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.370
You still want to be friends?

19:35.370 --> 19:36.530
I do!

19:36.540 --> 19:38.370
Phil, I know a million people,

19:38.370 --> 19:41.000
but I really don't have
a lot of real friends.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.040
Not even the sports guy?

19:42.040 --> 19:43.940
You guys are always
laughing so crazy hard

19:43.940 --> 19:45.140
out of the commercials.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.040
Chip fielder?
No. That's all fake.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.680
Fake as tricia tazaki's
shelter dogs!

19:49.680 --> 19:50.780
(chuckles)
careful, buddy.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.220
Look, maybe you should go.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.620
I'm not going anywhere!

19:53.620 --> 19:55.620
I'm going live in a second.
You're in my shot.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.890
Oh. I get it.
Call me.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.290
Call me!

19:59.290 --> 20:01.530
(wind howling)

20:01.530 --> 20:03.290
that's right, steve,
but you're gonna want

20:03.300 --> 20:04.830
to leave your kites
at home tonight.

20:04.830 --> 20:08.270
My wind-erful forecast
right after this.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.470
(sighs)

20:11.470 --> 20:13.870
(uplifting music plays)

20:15.570 --> 20:17.010
my name is manny delgado,

20:17.010 --> 20:18.680
and I'm two people.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.080
I'm the child
of an immigrant single mother,

20:21.080 --> 20:23.980
who taught me to believe
in myself and dream big.

20:23.980 --> 20:26.920
I'm also the step-son
of a businessman

20:26.920 --> 20:28.820
who opened his home
and his heart to me

20:28.820 --> 20:30.320
and showed me, by example,

20:30.320 --> 20:32.760
how to make
those dreams come true.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.730
Whatever I am,
whatever I have to give,

20:35.730 --> 20:38.830
is a product of these two
very different worlds.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.700
It was so sweet
that jay cried a little bit.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.830
He's a good kid.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.570
And it's gonna be weird
around here without him,

20:46.570 --> 20:49.610
but at least I'll always
have my special girl.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.170
Mmm!

20:51.180 --> 20:54.140
And you'd never leave me,
would you, baby? Mm!

20:58.180 --> 20:59.580
I just want you to know

20:59.590 --> 21:02.050
I'm really okay with you
dating rainer.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.090
Thanks, dad.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.190
Yeah, he's got
a really nice house...

21:05.190 --> 21:06.760
Jacuzzi tub in his bathroom.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.890
Don't love that you know that.

21:07.890 --> 21:09.460
Look up.

21:09.460 --> 21:10.890
Hey, he mentioned
this hair spray

21:10.900 --> 21:12.460
that's just oil
and a little sea salt.

21:12.460 --> 21:14.200
Oh, that's more for
conditioning that hold.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.530
Okay, wow, that was a close one.

21:15.530 --> 21:16.400
All right.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.440
Now, brush...

21:18.440 --> 21:19.570
Blot...
(smacks lips)

21:19.570 --> 21:21.070
(smacks lips)

21:21.070 --> 21:22.610
and beautiful.
Thanks, honey.

21:22.610 --> 21:24.610
It's really great they're
having you back on the news.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.530
No, no, I'm getting
a new driver's license photo.

21:28.110 --> 21:31.980
<font color="#ffff00">Captions by vitac...</font>
