00:03.760 --> 00:05.359

00:05.360 --> 00:08.465
You will all give Mr
Jackson your full support

00:08.466 --> 00:10.799
in his temporary role
as Acting Governor.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.045
Look, you know how important it is

00:12.046 --> 00:13.985
for the Governor and the Top
Dog to support each other.

00:13.990 --> 00:16.879
- You wanna work together again.
- We make a great team, Kaz.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.879
Liz, this is Dr Miller,
the new staff psychiatrist.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.519
Hi, Liz. Greg Miller.
Pleased to meet you.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.479
You know how to tango?
It's for Lizzie's bucket list.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.159

she can't remember anything.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.519
Fuckin' Greek next door giving
me jack-shit. Kaz has got to her.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.439
You're putting heroin in front
of me, knowing my history.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.399
Are you seriously asking me to do this?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.039
Come on, just this one
time. Please, Allie.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.479
This one time, OK?
That's it. Never again.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.480
You killed Ray.

00:40.481 --> 00:44.560
- The Butchers hit Ray because of what you did!
- Ahh!

keep Proctor in isolation forever.

go into protection.

be isolated, it's her.

to bring in the drugs.

06:36.931 --> 06:38.599
She's the one that
should be in isolation.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.759

- That's because I flushed them.

to make this prison safer for
the women. Do you remember that?

06:48.560 --> 06:51.560

was able to smother that blast.

- If she had died...
- Trust me, she is the threat.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.789
She's going to keep using
those women as drug mules,

- bringing that shit in...
- Stop. Just stop!

- Big Fev?
- No. Nah, Dr Miller, hey?

- Ooh.
- Yeah. He took off all his clothes, eh?

08:23.413 --> 08:25.519
- Ahh.
- Everything except for his tie.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.919
And his body was, like, completely
smooth, which is kinda weird

08:28.920 --> 08:31.319
- 'cause normally I like me blokes hairy.
- Hairy, yeah, you do.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
- Hairy, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:32.321 --> 08:33.370
Was he smooth down there, too?

08:33.371 --> 08:35.239
I couldn't see 'cause
his tie was too long.

- Yeah.

out of here is get a fuckin' root!

- Yeah.
- Did I?

- Yeah.

out all over the prison.

kill an inmate. I'm sorry.

will just try and step up.

that's a bad thing.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.559

the women's best interests at heart.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.250
You know, with therapy,
there is a good chance

09:40.251 --> 09:41.679
we can stop this from happening again.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.719
She's never gonna see a shrink,
especially not a male one.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.852
She came back to me and
said she's willing to try.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.479
So whatever you said worked.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.970
Look, of course, we need
Dr Miller's assurance

09:50.971 --> 09:53.439
that she's no longer a danger.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.840

stake his balls on it.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.920
- It's Kaz.
- Sorry, Kaz.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.800
- Why did you attack her?
- She's poison.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.039
She got my friend Allie
to score drugs for her.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.879
So she's gonna get her hooked
so she can use her again.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.719
Use her?

10:31.720 --> 10:33.720
- For what?
- Power.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.280
Well, you must care a lot about Allie.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.840
Why do you think you
responded with violence?

10:48.960 --> 10:51.000

staff wouldn't be able to help?

10:57.520 --> 10:59.520

11:03.640 --> 11:06.520

over her little drug empire.

could have been the rat.

- Go ahead. Who's gonna believe you?

- Yeah, right.

lookin' at 15 years if I'm lucky.

were they? You had to split?

from experience there, mate.

- Ahh, I need a favour.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.199
- OK.
- I wanna get Lizzie a root.

- Yeah.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.759
Booms, how are you gonna
get a prostitute in here?

13:34.760 --> 13:38.439
Yeah, no, I'll sort that shit
out. Don't worry about that.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.650
So can you help me or...
or what? It's, um...

13:41.651 --> 13:43.451
It's for Lizzie's bucket list.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.840
I'll make some calls.

- Cool.
- Hey.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.759

know, the new shrink. He's...

appointment with Dr Miller.

- I didn't make an appointment.

- No.

14:26.300 --> 14:30.180
Just some notes to remind
myself what we talked about.

- Would you like some tea?
- No, I'd like to know why I'm here again.

- I just wanna know you're OK.
- I'm fine.

Allie about what happened?

- You had no right, Kaz.
- You had your nose in that shit.

Do you really wanna
go back to that place?

15:44.017 --> 15:46.140
- Do you remember how bad that was?
- It's my choice.

15:46.141 --> 15:47.893
It's Marie. She's gonna chew you up

- In every way.

You're the expert.
Why don't you tell me?

19:30.460 --> 19:33.379
Well, victims of abuse can
respond in various ways.

regain a sense of power in some way.

Red Right Hand was about for you?

- About empowerment?
- Maybe.

- Were you trying to empower the women you were protecting?
- Yes.

gratitude for your involvement?

- Yeah, most of them did.
- But there were some who weren't grateful.

- Nothing.

20:12.020 --> 20:16.050
Is it fair to say that your
beliefs about protecting women

20:16.660 --> 20:19.750
led to the behaviour which
brought you to Wentworth?

20:19.751 --> 20:20.971
What do you reckon?

20:20.980 --> 20:22.370
And since being in prison,

20:22.371 --> 20:26.500
those beliefs have actually led
you to attack and kill other women.

20:26.501 --> 20:28.660
Would you agree with that?

20:29.860 --> 20:31.099
I suppose.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.009
And that, at least in the case of Allie,

20:33.310 --> 20:35.619

you're trying to protect.

wanted her to grow up,

42:34.810 --> 42:36.810
Huh.

42:42.410 --> 42:45.890
- You're gettin' fucked!
- Oh, bloody great!

42:46.250 --> 42:48.689
Yeah, bloody great... Whoa, what's that?

42:48.690 --> 42:51.289
Oh, it was just an accident
overnight, you know.

42:51.290 --> 42:53.009
Oh. I'll get Kaz.

42:53.010 --> 42:54.689
- No, no, no, love, don't bother her.
- No, it's alright.

42:54.690 --> 42:58.609
It's just to do with the
new medication, Boomer.

42:58.610 --> 43:00.610
Oh, God.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.290
- You alright?
- Yeah.

43:06.770 --> 43:09.769
It's gonna take more than
damp sheets to ruin my day.

43:09.770 --> 43:12.655
- Good for you.
- I've got such good friends.

43:12.656 --> 43:17.409
They're looking out for me, keeping
me company, organising sex for me.

43:17.410 --> 43:20.769
I mean, how bad can things
really be, love? You know?

43:20.770 --> 43:25.170
And you can't live in the
past. It'll drive you crazy.

43:38.770 --> 43:43.650
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for what I did to your brother.

43:44.530 --> 43:46.930
I don't expect forgiveness.

43:48.490 --> 43:50.481
But if I could go
back and change things,

43:50.482 --> 43:53.482
I would do that in a heartbeat.

44:06.650 --> 44:09.850
That should keep you going for a while.

44:10.170 --> 44:13.250
I want you to do something else for me.

44:14.890 --> 44:16.890
(SIGHS)

44:18.050 --> 44:20.530
I want you to kill Kaz Proctor.

When I was a kid, I was the victim.

44:35.512 --> 44:39.070
I was Karen. But I refuse
to let that be my story.

44:39.075 --> 44:41.056
All I ever wanted to do

44:41.102 --> 44:42.361
was the protect the vulnerable.

44:42.384 --> 44:45.202
- So, what do you want.
- It ends. Now.

44:45.327 --> 44:48.422
I want you to kill Kaz Proctor.

44:48.444 --> 44:50.125
I want her gone...

44:50.176 --> 44:51.973
(ECHOES) ... gone, gone...
