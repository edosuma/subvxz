21:12.897 --> 21:16.117
Cool. It really makes me happy to see
my two boys hanging out.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.445
I got some unpacking to do.
I'll text you guys later.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.581
BOTH: Phew!

21:22.782 --> 21:25.376
Did you hear that?
She called me one of her two "boys."

21:25.576 --> 21:27.169
She was looking at me, though.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.714
Look, Robbie, if we stay at each other's
throats, we'll both lose Wendy.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.792
We need to make a cold war pact.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.551
Okay. What's that?

21:34.752 --> 21:37.096
We need to learn
to just hate each other in silence.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.015
You mean, like, what girls do?

21:40.216 --> 21:42.310
Yeah, exactly. "What girls do."

21:43.803 --> 21:47.478
So then I told Thompson,
"Hey, save some for the rest of us!"

21:47.640 --> 21:48.562
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:48.724 --> 21:50.567
- Good one, Wendy! Yeah.
- Good one, Wendy! That's great.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.520
Oh, man! Just a second.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.907
(GROWLS)

21:57.274 --> 21:58.321
So as I was saying...

21:58.484 --> 22:00.703
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah, no,
you're the best! Yeah.

22:00.903 --> 22:01.904
- So fun, yeah.
- You know you're great.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.489
Everybody's friends! We're all friends!

22:03.823 --> 22:05.825
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

22:08.118 --> 22:10.541
I'm Dipper.
I have shorts and determination!

22:10.746 --> 22:13.124
(IMITATING ITALIAN ACCENT)
It's me, Mabel.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.710
I'm slower, but I jump higher.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.719
Pick me, or whatever.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.346
(CHOMPING)

22:21.465 --> 22:23.012
(SNORING) Oh!

22:23.259 --> 22:25.227
Alas, t'was naught but a dream.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.270
(SNORING)

22:27.471 --> 22:28.688
(CHOMPING)

22:30.057 --> 22:31.274
Eating my friends.
