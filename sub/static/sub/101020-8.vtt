WEBVTT

00:21.563 --> 00:22.772
What the hell happened?

00:24.399 --> 00:25.233
Just...

00:25.775 --> 00:27.527
Second assassination attempt.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.612
I think I got some in my mouth.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.239
God damn it.

00:31.781 --> 00:32.991
This chair's an antique.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.534
What spell did he use?

00:34.617 --> 00:35.744
I don't know.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.622
I think he customized a murder spell
and cast it on himself.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.707
Customized?

00:40.790 --> 00:42.500
He changed the magic word.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.044
That's impossible.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.837
It's not impossible, it's just...

00:45.920 --> 00:47.338
It's extremely difficult.

00:47.422 --> 00:51.551
There are several different incantations
that could cause this kind of damage.

00:51.634 --> 00:52.886
So much blood.

00:54.012 --> 00:54.888
I hope it's not mine.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.891
Clean yourself up,
and send down some disciples.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.393
You need to delay the vote.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.730
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

01:05.482 --> 01:08.610
You're not actually implying
what I think you're implying.

01:09.194 --> 01:13.323
A mysterious, secret organization
appears out of nowhere,

01:13.615 --> 01:17.243
its leader miraculously captured
on the eve of <i>Invocare.</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:21.748
Of all the incompetent things
you have ever done, and they are legion,

01:21.831 --> 01:24.793
this is by far the most incompetent.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.170
My incompetence is not in question here.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.422
-No, it isn't.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.551
I meant that it will be up to
the new Grand Magus to decide your fate.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.970
You can't proceed until you know
what you're dealing with!

01:36.471 --> 01:39.182
I couldn't stop <i>Invocare</i>
even if I wanted to.

01:39.849 --> 01:40.934
And I don't.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.519
Magus?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.270
Get those three idiots in here now!

01:44.646 --> 01:47.899
You do not have the authority
to command disciples anymore.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.609
I am still Temple Magus.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.945
And I am head of the Gnostic Council.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.739
Fine, Bitsy! What do you want to do?

01:57.325 --> 01:58.827
Get those wolves in here now.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.917
-But as prisoners.

02:07.043 --> 02:07.877
Gross.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.721
Look, Salvador must have Midnight's hide.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.890
Well, I can't believe
Midnight would bond with her.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.811
I don't know if you've noticed, dude,
but Midnight is kind of indiscriminate.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.896
-We gotta get the hide back.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.065
Get to the temple.
Vera wants to see you.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.151
Hey.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.318
Yeah, hi.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.572
We're here to escort you back.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.615
Well, tell her thanks, but we're busy.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.825
You're liars

02:39.450 --> 02:40.285
and werewolves.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
And one way or another,
you're coming with us.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.539
Do yourselves a favor. Put those away.

02:44.622 --> 02:45.748
Orders are orders.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.834
Would you all just put them
back in your pants?

02:48.376 --> 02:49.252
Foley is dead.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.462
Everyone thinks you're responsible.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.048
So Vera's throwing us to the wolves?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.467
The metaphorical ones.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.635
We don't know that.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.012
She doesn't want to.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.223
But her opinion might not matter
much longer.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.266
Is Vera okay?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.560
They're going to vote her out,

03:05.643 --> 03:06.853
and once she's gone,

03:07.395 --> 03:08.229
so are you.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.814
The way I see it,

03:09.898 --> 03:11.649
you can wolf your way out of here

03:11.733 --> 03:13.943
and force the Order
to send an army after you--

03:14.027 --> 03:16.112
-An army of elitist douche nozzles?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.864
Or you could go and face them head on.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.699
And you're going in chained.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.869
Not happening.

03:25.830 --> 03:26.831
He doesn't like you.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.668
I don't like you, either.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.306
So...

03:43.973 --> 03:44.807
disgusting.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.684
It always gets on the ceiling.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.562
I don't understand why we can't
just use magic to clean all of this up.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.357
If we use the wrong cleaning spell
and there's a bad reaction,

03:52.440 --> 03:54.442
we might have a bigger mess on our hands.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.241
You're cleaning that up.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.580
From the sounds of things,
we won't have to worry about

04:07.664 --> 04:10.166
Vera Stone's opinion for much longer.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.793
Or her pet wolves.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.215
For someone who was all up
in her wolf's grill not so long ago,

04:17.298 --> 04:19.342
you've sure seemed to change your tune.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.512
Just 'cause I had feelings for Lilith
doesn't mean I like the rest of them.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.389
Hm. For your sake, I hope that's true.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.140
Excuse me?

04:26.224 --> 04:28.518
Well, you sound legit, it's just,

04:28.810 --> 04:31.813
when Vera's gone, you may be called on
to prove your loyalty.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.951
After we learned about the attacks
on the Order,

04:45.034 --> 04:47.870
which included the capture
of one of our disciples...

04:48.871 --> 04:50.957
-That would be him.
-Can you be serious for one second?

04:51.040 --> 04:51.958
Not if I can avoid it.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.336
...we then tracked down Cameron Foley
to a Praxis safe house,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.547
captured him,
and brought him here to the temple.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.881
Thank you,

04:58.965 --> 05:00.717
and thank you for your work.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.053
And what special considerations
did Vera offer you

05:04.137 --> 05:06.014
in exchange for bringing her a scapegoat?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.432
Foley's not a scapegoat.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.142
Look, you're wasting time.

05:09.225 --> 05:12.312
If you want to know about Foley,
find Salvador Grant.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.272
We think she's their true leader.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.275
I thought Cameron Foley
was the leader of Praxis.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.526
Yeah, so did we.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.654
But now that he's dead,
someone else is the <i>actual </i>leader?

05:22.447 --> 05:24.073
Isn't that a little convenient?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.701
I'd argue that it's actually inconvenient.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.371
And is there anything else we need
to know about this new villain?

05:31.873 --> 05:33.666
-I would--
- Answer the question.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.792
-I mean...
-No.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.253
Uh, she's...

05:38.046 --> 05:40.173
also a werewolf?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.262
Oh, man.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.223
This is so sad.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.602
The wolves are just
trying to do their jobs,

05:52.685 --> 05:54.854
and we're treating them
like they're the bad guys.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.689
Thank you, philosophus.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.525
Please wait until we ask
for your testimony.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.237
I mean, come on! What did they do
to deserve this kind of treatment?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.448
That will be all, Mr. Brown.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.450
You're wrong to treat them like this.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.618
Get a hold of yourself.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.580
There's so much

06:13.206 --> 06:14.665
anger in the world.

06:15.541 --> 06:20.213
Things would be so much better if we just
took a moment to appreciate one another.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.256
What is wrong with you?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.722
-<i>Notas argenteas!</i>

06:29.806 --> 06:32.350
I think cleaning up the Ethics professor

06:32.433 --> 06:34.685
-earns me the day...

06:35.520 --> 06:36.396
...off.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.192
They locked us in.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.281
You have no right
to put us into quarantine.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.741
Whatever incantation killed Foley

06:48.825 --> 06:50.743
-has some kind of chain reaction.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.912
We can't risk it escaping from the temple.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.331
More likely you killed Foley
and then Robert yourself.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.167
Robert wasn't killed by an incantation.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.378
We didn't hear any ringing.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.088
What ringing?

07:02.505 --> 07:04.715
Anytime anyone does bad magic,

07:04.799 --> 07:06.300
the Knights hear a ringing.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.802
It's like a magic alarm.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.054
Oh. Yet another convenience.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.974
Your conspiracy theories
are starting to bore me.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.559
And your willingness to resort

07:14.642 --> 07:17.937
to fear and lies to achieve your goals
is starting to terrify me.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.021
Think this through.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.232
All right?
Foley knew exactly what he was doing.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.360
This is how Praxis works.
Strategy and deception.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.070
All right? They played us.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.406
I was so desperate
to do the right thing, I let it happen.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.782
So you admit it?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.117
This is your fault.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.535
Oh, you want to blame me?

07:32.618 --> 07:33.578
Go ahead,

07:33.661 --> 07:35.830
as long as we can concentrate
on trying to stop this.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.043
The temple is cleansed. Again.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.881
Then we can proceed.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.181
She's wrong. This is just the beginning.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.725
Of course she's wrong. She's Kepler.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.018
The problem is proving it

07:57.101 --> 07:59.520
before she strips me
of the rest of my authority.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.316
Was there something else?

08:04.984 --> 08:08.112
Alyssa thinks that
you kept the Vade Maecum.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.990
She thinks it's the reason
her magic is on the fritz.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.867
Miss Drake has made me aware
of her theories.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.202
That's not a no.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.539
You know, so far this week, I have sworn
an oath I didn't know I swore,

08:18.623 --> 08:21.292
and I've put my thumbprint
on a worthless amnesty.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.711
In case you haven't noticed,
we have more pressing concerns.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.214
And then I found out
that you lied to us again.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.132
You know what I told Alyssa?

08:28.216 --> 08:31.302
That if you did keep it,
you didn't do it with malicious intent.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.472
Don't make me regret that.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.140
Noted.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.389
-<i>Aperiatur.</i>

09:16.472 --> 09:18.391
-Oh, shit.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.644
She deserved that.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.074
Okay then.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.375
The sun rose on the first dawn.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.002
Magic rose with it,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.713
and cleaved itself in four,

11:13.297 --> 11:14.882
creating the elements:

11:15.257 --> 11:19.095
water, earth, air, and fire.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.264
Fire appeared before the first human.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.391
She said,

11:23.724 --> 11:24.934
"Behold,

11:25.393 --> 11:28.688
I am that which can sustain you.

11:29.021 --> 11:32.608
Worship me, and I will share my magic."

11:33.025 --> 11:35.194
The first human said, "Yes."

11:36.237 --> 11:38.406
His name was Magus.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.994
Vera Stone has been nominated
for Grand Magus.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.082
Who here will bestow upon her their light?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.840
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.969
She betrayed Edward Coventry.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.305
She inducted the wolves
she betrayed him with.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.851
And she destroyed the Vade Maecum.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.227
How can you vote for her?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.568
The way I see it...

12:16.610 --> 12:18.487
she saved us from Edward.

12:19.488 --> 12:23.117
She brought the wolves to heel,
and now they're our trusted allies.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.580
She also just cut the head off Praxis.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.416
Ian Ziering, put your mask back on

12:30.499 --> 12:32.793
and stop using your celebrity glamour.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.714
Okay, couple things.
One, I can't turn this off.

12:37.131 --> 12:41.343
Two, I support Vera Stone for Grand Magus.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.765
She brought power, strength,
sophistication to the Order.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.308
She deserves our fealty.

12:52.146 --> 12:56.358
God, how many murder incantations
does one secret society need?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.195
Apparently, all of them.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.657
You guys do realize that technically,
we're walking murder spells?

13:03.741 --> 13:07.703
Wow, way to take all the fun
out of being a werewolf.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.998
Hey, I think I got something.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.084
On the dangers
of a ricocheting incantation.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.254
Yeah, but the magic half-life rule
still applies,

13:17.338 --> 13:19.799
so whatever killed Foley
wouldn't have killed Robert.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.808
It's only going to glow
once the vote is unanimous.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.725
I know.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.394
Guys, wait.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.647
I think I found something. Look.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.819
Randall, this is serious.
People are dying.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.030
Correction, people who are trying
to kill us are dying.

13:43.113 --> 13:46.408
Which is why we have to figure out what's
happening before anyone else is affected.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.369
-Yeah.
-Or infected.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.705
Wait.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.041
What if we're looking at this wrong?

13:54.416 --> 13:57.253
Maybe it's not a murder incantation.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.754
Maybe it's an enchanted virus.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.548
So what are we talking about here?

14:00.631 --> 14:01.507
Magic Ebola?

14:01.966 --> 14:04.426
Yes! Alexander Hame-ilton for the win!

14:04.510 --> 14:05.928
Please stop.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.480
Okay. Okay.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.899
If I was an uptight,

14:18.983 --> 14:22.653
manipulative liar
with impeccable lip liner...

14:24.029 --> 14:27.116
where would I hide
the most dangerous book in the world?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.169
"Hysterical."

14:50.514 --> 14:51.932
<i>Secreta revelentur.</i>

14:55.978 --> 14:57.354
It's obviously empty.

14:59.148 --> 14:59.982
You.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.693
How was the rest of the party?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.945
-Get laid?
-You're with Praxis.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.074
Really? Even with your messy magic?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.294
Nice sleep spell, dum-dum.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.549
You think Foley enchanted a virus?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.969
It explains why it didn't die
with Foley or Robert.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.263
The virus is alive,
carrying the magic with it.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.974
The sacrifice is the death of the host,

15:34.058 --> 15:36.101
propelling the virus to the next victim.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.562
So how do we stop it?

15:38.646 --> 15:39.772
With this.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.025
An enchanted cure-all.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.652
BT-dubs, you ever think of sharing this?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.862
It's literally a cure-<i>all.</i>

15:51.700 --> 15:53.285
Editorials aside,

15:53.369 --> 15:55.371
this is excellent work.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.415
We should have all these ingredients
in stock...

15:59.375 --> 16:01.835
except for the St. John's wort.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.047
So much for that.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.550
I stock a bitters made of St. John's wort.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.510
Would that work?

16:10.094 --> 16:10.928
It might.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.096
I'll get it.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.014
You'll mess up my bar.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.099
I don't need a babysitter.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.308
Why do you sound like a baby?

16:16.392 --> 16:17.977
-Why do you look like a baby?
-Oh, man.

16:19.019 --> 16:22.398
Look, we can brew the potion,
but we can't force anyone to drink it.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.234
I mean, we could, but we shouldn't.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.945
Our first priority's the adepti.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.114
And anyone that came in contact
with the blood.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.241
Of course. Brew the potion.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.661
I have to find a way
to break the conclave.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.207
<i>God damn it, Ziering.</i>

16:40.290 --> 16:41.959
<i>Everything you have is because of us.</i>

16:42.418 --> 16:43.711
Now quit stalling.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.546
This has gone on long enough.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.425
Councilor, are you trying
to dictate my vote?

16:50.092 --> 16:53.137
I am imploring you to do what's best
for this Order.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.056
That's funny.
I thought that's what I was doing.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.643
-Now what?
- Oh, nice.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.729
And you're the one who said
no cell phones.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.568
Let's get this over with.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.452
Hey, sleepyhead,
come have a glass with me.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.416
Your leader was captured.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.917
It's over.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.962
Foley didn't run Praxis,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.465
and if everything's gone
according to plan...

17:29.548 --> 17:31.425
...he's dead,

17:31.508 --> 17:33.844
along with your beloved Grand Magus.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.265
Thanks, but I don't want anything
from you.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.434
We can break bread.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.686
Or bones.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.480
Your choice.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.107
Pull up a seat.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.025
Sit.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.111
That's better.

17:59.536 --> 18:03.499
I don't take drinks from strangers
who murder my friends.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.835
Plus, I've seen <i>The Princess Bride.</i>

18:19.014 --> 18:20.099
As you wish.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.773
Mm.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.280
Acheron's cauldron.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.159
You summoned Zecchia.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.702
You robbed the Knights.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.747
How did you know when to strike?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.543
There's only one divination that accurate.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.045
Necromancy.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.089
I dabble.

18:52.172 --> 18:56.385
But right now,
I am all about this risotto.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.096
Well, in that case,

18:59.847 --> 19:01.098
don't forget the Parmesan.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.350
Parmesan!

19:04.017 --> 19:05.435
You read my mind.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.115
Really?

19:21.618 --> 19:22.786
Not impressed.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.550
How do we know

19:36.633 --> 19:38.677
-you're not trying to poison us?
-Oh, for God's sake.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.263
What? Like I haven't seen
<i>The Princess Bride.</i>

19:41.680 --> 19:43.307
William Goldman's a genius.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.767
Mr. Morton, if you would be so kind.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.608
- Those bitters are nice.
-Thanks.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.943
-The little things make the drink.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.028
Still not taking it.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.113
None of us got any blood yakked on us.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.282
You got blood on you?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.117
Better safe than sorry.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.996
Surprisingly,

20:06.079 --> 20:07.456
-not disgusting.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.083
What are you doing?
You didn't get any blood on you either.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.501
Why take the risk?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.424
It's like what Vera said
when she inducted the wolves.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.093
This Order is my family.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.555
Remember when we inducted Jack
after he slayed the golem?

20:23.639 --> 20:26.058
Or that crazy elemental transference?

20:26.141 --> 20:28.310
Fighting the wolves
in that abandoned house?

20:29.019 --> 20:31.772
Those memories are better than Christmas
for me.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.482
Who is she again?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.692
I've literally never seen her
before today.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.195
There is nothing
that I wouldn't do for you.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.572
Any of you.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.574
Even these stupid wolves,

20:43.158 --> 20:45.202
you mean the world to me.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.454
Uh, I barely know you.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.332
-She's infected. Stand back.
-Loneliness is terminal.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.917
We need to reach out.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.043
We need to bond.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.170
<i>-Te repello!</i>

21:06.890 --> 21:07.891
Nicole.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.069
The wolves robbed the Order!

21:20.487 --> 21:22.948
Yeah, and then Praxis robbed us, remember?

21:23.031 --> 21:24.116
It's their fault.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.868
Nicole knew about this and I didn't?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.412
I was trying to cheer her up.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.746
Did you know about this?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.915
Concern yourself with cleaning her up.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.500
I don't think so.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.919
The Grand Magus just gave you an order.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.963
She's not my Magus.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.897
I'm gonna go try not to die.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.069
Magus.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.031
Clean her up.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.492
Did we just get stuck cleaning up Terry?

22:07.659 --> 22:09.578
-Yep.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.079
- Not it.
-Uh...

22:16.585 --> 22:17.919
I said, "Not it."

22:22.341 --> 22:23.592
Uh, guys?

22:36.438 --> 22:37.522
Holy shit.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.358
Is it alive?

22:42.527 --> 22:43.528
So,

22:44.237 --> 22:46.490
it infects the host, consumes the blood,

22:46.573 --> 22:51.161
and then when it reaches critical mass,
it alters our behavioral pattern.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.623
Like a <i>toxoplasma gondii.</i>

22:55.290 --> 22:57.626
Oh, yeah, right, that one.
How could I forget?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.378
It's a parasite.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.797
It gets into mice
and takes away their fear of cats

23:01.880 --> 23:03.632
so it can get into the cat next.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.385
Maybe that's what's happening here.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.305
The parasite makes the host
incredibly needy.

23:10.847 --> 23:11.807
Vulnerable.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.184
They seek comfort,
which only seems normal

23:14.267 --> 23:15.769
in a situation like this.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.606
But it's just trying to get close enough
to puke blood on you.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.149
Exactly.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.528
Even if the blood vomit misses its target,

23:24.611 --> 23:27.114
then the parasite still has a chance
of finding a host.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.618
Basically, it could be in all of us,

23:31.701 --> 23:33.495
and we don't even know it.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.914
So how do we kill it?

23:36.915 --> 23:37.749
Dude,

23:38.208 --> 23:40.419
I don't even know
how to get it off my shoe.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.965
You knew those bastards were responsible
and you didn't tell anyone?

23:45.048 --> 23:46.299
I wish I hadn't said anything.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.343
Kepler's just looking for an excuse
to kill them.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.345
I don't want anyone else's
blood on my hands.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.180
-She's starting to sound like Terry.
-Hang on.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.890
I'm not infected.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.726
-But you did get Terry's blood on you.
-You got Foley's on you.

23:56.810 --> 23:57.644
So did you,

23:57.727 --> 24:00.230
-which makes you infected twice.
-This is bullshit.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.150
I'm not going to wait around
and let those assholes pick us off.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.694
Hmm. But the virus...

24:05.777 --> 24:07.028
There's no virus.

24:07.988 --> 24:08.947
Who's with me?

24:10.824 --> 24:12.242
Tell me you have good news.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.495
Okay, so we think that it might be
a magic blood parasite.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.290
It's ambulatory and appears to be
highly aggressive.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.084
So there's a good chance
that everybody's already infected.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.836
How is any of this good news?

24:24.212 --> 24:26.506
Okay, so it's not technically good news.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.800
Vera Stone!

24:35.265 --> 24:36.099
How dare you?

24:39.728 --> 24:40.812
Councilor.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.565
Praxis wasn't responsible
for the temple thefts.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.483
The wolves were.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.654
Well, can't walk that one back.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.075
This is a boilerplate recipe.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.828
But I add a little something extra.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.414
Human blood.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.671
Mmm.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.466
Kidding.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.885
Fresh shaved truffle.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.554
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.642
Ohhh.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.644
Come on, you're going to like it.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.812
And if I don't, are you gonna kill me?

25:27.317 --> 25:28.735
Inconceivable.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.238
Once we've liberated magic,

25:31.321 --> 25:32.572
the killing ends.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.576
It's the hoarding that makes
practitioners so murderous.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.537
The desire to keep magic for themselves

25:38.620 --> 25:39.663
at any cost.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.289
Yeah, that's...

25:41.373 --> 25:44.000
It's an interesting way to justify
all the murders you've committed.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.254
Please. The Sons of Prometheus
slaughter any intruder on their land.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.257
The Order's legacy is bathed in blood.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.717
And don't get me started
on the Knights of Saint Christopher.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.179
I have yet to encounter a magic society

25:56.263 --> 25:59.349
that doesn't endorse violence
as a means to an end.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.309
Present company included.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.689
Praxis isn't a secret society.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.358
You know how you can tell?

26:09.359 --> 26:10.610
It's not a secret.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.905
You can dress it up however you want.
People are still dying because of you.

26:14.614 --> 26:15.490
It still bothers you.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.242
That I killed Ellie Taylor?

26:18.785 --> 26:19.744
Of course it does.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.414
I think about it every day.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.750
So...

26:26.668 --> 26:28.587
if you had stuck me with that knife...

26:30.088 --> 26:31.548
you'd never forget me?

26:34.718 --> 26:35.677
Probably not.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.932
Well, I'd rather you remembered me
for this risotto.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.231
Oh, my God.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.484
It's actually really good.

26:53.987 --> 26:54.821
So,

26:55.322 --> 26:57.616
maybe you can learn something
from hanging out with me.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.290
All this time...

27:05.999 --> 27:08.585
the culprits have been under our nose,

27:09.127 --> 27:10.712
and you've been protecting them.

27:11.254 --> 27:14.090
Well, I wouldn't really
call it "protection."

27:14.174 --> 27:17.135
Look, forget about the robbery.
We've got a bigger problem on our hands.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.762
Somehow I doubt that.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.305
Then it's your funeral.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.058
We've heard enough from your pets, Vera.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.559
That will be all.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.770
God damn it, that won't be all.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.105
If you don't listen to me, you'll be dead,

27:29.189 --> 27:30.065
all of you.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.654
It's time to end this farce
and install an actual

27:36.237 --> 27:37.405
Grand Magus.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.702
You all saw that.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.788
A Knight of Saint Christopher,

27:45.205 --> 27:46.665
our sworn enemy...

27:47.832 --> 27:49.167
in the reliquary.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.964
You cannot elect Vera Stone.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.842
Well, you still haven't offered us
an alternative.

27:58.426 --> 28:01.846
We all know there is only one among us

28:01.930 --> 28:04.099
with the magic knowledge

28:04.349 --> 28:06.685
and strength to lead this Order.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.981
My fellow adepti...

28:13.191 --> 28:14.776
so nice to see you again.

28:15.318 --> 28:16.236
What?

28:16.444 --> 28:18.738
I didn't know they made robes
in kids' sizes.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.741
Don't expect me
to vote for this necromancer.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.743
Who you calling a necromancer?

28:24.536 --> 28:28.206
If you bathe in the blood of virgins
to maintain your youthful glow,

28:28.873 --> 28:29.833
you're a necromancer.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.251
Says the one practitioner

28:31.334 --> 28:33.878
who couldn't use magic
to salvage his career.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.716
Really? Well, six <i>Sharknados </i>and counting,
Mr. "I'm Famous in Canada."

28:37.799 --> 28:39.551
-Oh, my God!
- Really small...

28:40.135 --> 28:42.178
Both of you, be quiet.

28:44.973 --> 28:48.184
You expect me to renounce my support
for Vera Stone for him?

28:51.104 --> 28:53.106
Not without any special consideration.

28:55.024 --> 28:59.320
I'm sure the next Grand Magus
would be eager

28:59.863 --> 29:02.824
to reward a loyal supporter.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.745
I may consider it.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.165
You stay away from the next ten
Comic-Cons, how about that?

29:11.458 --> 29:12.292
Two.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.793
-Eight.
-Four.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.296
-Six.
-Five.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.047
Five.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.299
Deal.

29:23.762 --> 29:28.349
Adeptus Major Jason Priestley
has been nominated for Grand Magus.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.977
Who here will bestow upon him their light?

29:34.272 --> 29:35.690
Nine, ten, eleven...

29:37.525 --> 29:39.819
Guys, it has to be unanimous.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.155
Oh.

29:43.156 --> 29:43.990
Sorry.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.492
Idiot.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.763
I'm sorry, Vera.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.057
I saw Angus and I just...

30:09.140 --> 30:09.974
reacted.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.563
I almost died yesterday.

30:17.732 --> 30:20.151
Now it seems like I might die anyway.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.697
Part of me wishes
we never got our memories back.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.492
I could just go back to being... happy.

30:27.575 --> 30:31.287
The way you're talking, acolyte,
you better vomit blood next.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.165
Step back.

30:43.007 --> 30:43.842
Magus.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.766
Happiness is a fallacy.

30:53.935 --> 30:54.853
Pablum...

30:55.436 --> 30:57.605
fed to those afraid to be great.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.779
This next part is gonna hurt.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.325
Jason Priestley?

31:09.409 --> 31:11.911
-And Ian Ziering.
<i>-Sopite!</i>

31:15.915 --> 31:17.208
She's going to lose, isn't she?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.251
We don't know that.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.129
We never should have signed that amnesty.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.213
What choice did we have?

31:22.297 --> 31:24.382
Option C: "None of the above."

31:24.924 --> 31:26.509
We will never rescue Lilith

31:26.593 --> 31:28.761
without the Order's resources
or knowledge.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.431
-You think you can live with that?

31:31.514 --> 31:32.891
At least I'd be alive to try.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.560
<i>Sopite!</i>

31:41.232 --> 31:43.985
So, a magical utopia?

31:44.068 --> 31:45.403
That's your plan?

31:45.486 --> 31:46.988
I don't believe in utopias.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.073
Equal access for all.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.658
No more hierarchies.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.535
Make your own rules.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.120
Oops.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.497
Magic

31:56.581 --> 31:57.999
can never be equal.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.042
It's too complicated.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.544
People are either too lazy

32:02.128 --> 32:03.087
or greedy.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.714
What if I told you

32:04.797 --> 32:09.135
that there's an incantation that could
make magic accessible to everyone?

32:09.218 --> 32:11.763
A spell that did away
with all of your rituals,

32:11.846 --> 32:14.432
all of your bullshit sacrifices?

32:15.183 --> 32:17.810
All the stuff put in place
to make it hard for you?

32:17.894 --> 32:20.855
But the sacrifices are
the most important part of our training.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.358
That's a scam to keep you
under their control.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.568
You don't need their rules.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.653
You don't need them.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.323
Do you think the ice queen eats ice cream?

32:35.078 --> 32:37.622
Hm. She's an actual person.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.251
-<i>Quidquid requiritur, fiat.</i>

32:42.335 --> 32:43.169
What was that?

32:50.343 --> 32:51.302
Clever.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.972
But you can't outrun magic.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.431
I'll destroy it. I swear I will.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.058
Sure, whatever, go for it.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.686
I am finally impressed.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.062
You've got to join me.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.855
Come on. Be my Huckleberry.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.732
-Be your what?
-You see?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.401
We have so much we can teach each other.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.319
I'll teach you about westerns,
you'll teach me--

33:08.403 --> 33:09.487
How not to murder?

33:10.446 --> 33:11.948
A smart person told me once,

33:12.031 --> 33:13.533
when you know what's right for you,

33:13.616 --> 33:15.284
you have to push through and do it...

33:16.619 --> 33:18.538
even if you end up breaking a few hearts,

33:18.621 --> 33:19.789
including your own.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.125
I'm not leaving without this book.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.251
Go to town.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.336
It doesn't have the spell
I'm looking for anyway.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.130
I could take it straight to Vera.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.756
That's your choice.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.591
And that's all I want for anyone.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.052
Make your own decisions, live your life.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.430
When you figure out what you want,
call me.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.181
My card's in your pocket.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.175
Stupid metaphor.

34:14.761 --> 34:17.597
I dreamt that Jason Priestley
was Grand Magus.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.391
Sounds more like a nightmare.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.895
Couldn't be worse than that <i>90210</i> reboot.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.397
Will you all shut up
and let me die in peace?

34:26.481 --> 34:27.440
No one's dying.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.233
Not today.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.320
Except we don't know how to kill
those magic parasites.

34:32.653 --> 34:33.488
Okay.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.198
Let's go through what we do know.

34:35.281 --> 34:36.491
Yes. Let's do that.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.078
Let's spend our last minutes alive
talking about homicidal bugs.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.370
Okay.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.999
Foley said a magic word
and then exploded magic parasites

34:45.083 --> 34:46.042
all over Robert,

34:46.125 --> 34:49.504
and then Robert spewed blood
all over the antechamber,

34:49.587 --> 34:50.797
and it crawled onto Terry.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.548
I was being sarcastic.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.592
So what magic spell
instantly turns your blood

34:54.675 --> 34:57.095
into a murderous magic parasite?

34:57.595 --> 34:59.889
I don't memorize murder spells.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.479
This has to be racial profiling
or something.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.439
And there's no such spell.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.483
Foley blew up.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.611
Robert and Terry both vomited.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.780
If it was decaying magic,

35:15.863 --> 35:18.199
Terry should have done
something different,

35:18.282 --> 35:20.409
but she and Robert both died
the exact same way.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.663
You said Foley changed
the magic word, right?

35:24.497 --> 35:26.541
Who's to say he didn't change
two magic words?

35:27.041 --> 35:29.460
Two different incantations
at the same time.

35:30.002 --> 35:33.631
One incantation to transform the blood,

35:33.965 --> 35:37.385
the second incantation
to blow it all over the room?

35:37.468 --> 35:40.012
How can you transform your own blood
into a parasite?

35:40.096 --> 35:41.180
You can't.

35:41.264 --> 35:44.934
There's no spell that transforms
your blood into a magical creature.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.229
But...

35:49.814 --> 35:52.191
there is a creature that mimics blood.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.112
Open his stomach.

36:05.913 --> 36:09.125
You're looking for something small,
about this big, with a hard shell.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.103
<i>Homunculi Sanguis.</i>

36:30.521 --> 36:31.898
We need to get out of here.

36:36.777 --> 36:37.778
Nicole?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.238
We're not supposed to talk to you.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.033
I know you're mad at us,

36:42.116 --> 36:45.494
and maybe even at Lilith
for all these lies,

36:46.329 --> 36:47.955
and we probably deserve that.

36:48.039 --> 36:48.915
"Probably"?

36:48.998 --> 36:50.082
Okay, yeah, we do.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.751
Look,

36:51.834 --> 36:54.170
I get that you're scared of screwing up.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.298
I don't know what happened
at your last chapter, but...

36:57.924 --> 36:59.383
if you don't let us out,

37:00.134 --> 37:01.594
everyone will die...

37:02.887 --> 37:05.097
and there will be no one left
to save Lilith.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.642
They lied about the virus.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.268
We can't trust them.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.939
Maybe she deserves that.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.649
Maybe I hate her.

37:16.442 --> 37:17.276
Miss Birch...

37:18.611 --> 37:20.446
I know what happened at your last temple.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.032
It wasn't a mistake.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.034
You showed compassion.

37:26.535 --> 37:29.956
Don't let anyone convince you
that kindness is a failure.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.501
It doesn't seem like a virtue around here.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.336
So help me change that.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.588
Members like you prove

37:37.672 --> 37:41.634
that having a conscience and being
in the Order are not mutually exclusive.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.605
This doesn't mean I forgive you.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.773
It means you're going to.

37:55.856 --> 37:56.816
Dude, come on!

37:56.899 --> 37:57.733
Yeah.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.820
Get to work on that potion.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.657
To the new Grand Magus.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.201
-Thank you. Thank you.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.295
I need everyone to take
a big step away from each other.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.338
You have no authority here, Vera.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.298
Okay.

38:20.381 --> 38:23.259
Foley swallowed
an Egyptian homunculus beetle.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.468
Right now,

38:24.760 --> 38:27.471
your blood is being replaced
by a sentient creature.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.765
We are brewing the potion as we speak.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.600
All you have to do is take it.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.060
Do you hear that, everyone?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.229
We are creating life.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.606
Soon, we will all get to experience

38:37.690 --> 38:39.900
the biological imperative.

38:39.984 --> 38:40.818
Infected.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.445
Oh, surprise, surprise.

38:42.903 --> 38:43.821
It's a trick.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.448
Protect the Grand Magus.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.991
For fuck's sake, Kepler!

38:47.074 --> 38:49.035
Come on, you won!

38:49.118 --> 38:51.912
I have nothing to gain.
Just take the stupid potion.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.497
Save your lives!

38:53.581 --> 38:55.666
But if I take the potion,

38:55.750 --> 38:58.085
the homunculi will die, and I...

39:00.129 --> 39:01.589
-I always...
-Oh, hell, no!

39:02.006 --> 39:03.007
...wanted to

39:03.382 --> 39:05.676
get to... joy of...

39:25.529 --> 39:26.572
This changes nothing.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.034
You're not fit to lead this organization.

39:30.117 --> 39:30.993
That's fine.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.789
This isn't the kind of organization
I want to lead anyway.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.584
The Order has faced
great challenges lately,

39:38.667 --> 39:42.713
and we have met them with fear,
paranoia, and hostility.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.467
Meanwhile, three outsiders,
people we consider our enemy,

39:47.259 --> 39:50.429
did more for the Order today
than any other member.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.724
That's the kind of Order I'd rather lead,

39:54.141 --> 39:56.769
instead of this paranormal yacht club.

39:56.852 --> 39:57.853
Words.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.608
Nice words...

40:03.609 --> 40:04.443
but just words.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.821
Miss Drake, I'll get to you in a moment.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.447
There's nothing wrong with my magic.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.618
You were in my house?

40:12.701 --> 40:15.329
You know, I really thought
that you'd be a different leader.

40:16.038 --> 40:16.956
A better one.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.458
But you're just like all the rest.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.545
Uh... I cannot believe...

40:22.628 --> 40:25.464
-Don't start with me.
-...how wrong I was about you.

40:25.881 --> 40:28.884
To have the Vade Maecum this whole time
and not say a word?

40:30.177 --> 40:32.638
Well, that is truly the sign
of a great leader.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.350
There it is, Vera.

40:36.934 --> 40:37.977
It's all yours.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.562
But the cost...

40:40.896 --> 40:42.064
is my loyalty.

40:42.690 --> 40:46.360
Miss Drake, you really need to learn
the concept of timing.

40:47.736 --> 40:48.904
That's what I thought.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.998
You have my full support...

41:00.916 --> 41:01.750
Grand Magus.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.981
I should have known she'd send you.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.150
Actually, she didn't.

41:27.776 --> 41:28.903
And I wouldn't do it,

41:29.445 --> 41:30.779
even if she wanted me to.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.663
Look, Vera said if I could convince you
to come back and talk to her,

41:39.747 --> 41:42.124
-she would explain everything.
-She already had her chance.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.253
The Order's changing, Alyssa.

41:47.671 --> 41:51.217
It's becoming the thing you said it was,
the thing I hoped it would be.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.474
I used to be exactly where you are...

41:59.725 --> 42:00.684
with the Order...

42:02.228 --> 42:03.270
with Edward.

42:07.566 --> 42:08.901
I thought for sure...

42:10.110 --> 42:11.612
good would prevail.

42:16.075 --> 42:20.287
But I can't believe the Order
will serve anyone but themselves.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.457
No, we can fix it, from the inside.

42:25.000 --> 42:25.834
Together.

42:55.614 --> 42:56.448
No.

43:22.016 --> 43:25.144
You know, I was under
a terrific amount of pressure back there.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.690
Wasn't until that werewolf
showed up that...

43:31.025 --> 43:31.859
Well...

43:32.526 --> 43:33.736
That's what sunk ya.

43:35.362 --> 43:39.908
Ian, I know my candidacy
was only viable for as long as it was

43:40.367 --> 43:41.869
because of your support,

43:42.536 --> 43:43.787
and this spell

43:44.330 --> 43:45.789
is my way of thanking you.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.253
Greater riches and fame

43:52.171 --> 43:53.172
will be yours.

43:54.548 --> 43:55.424
For a few hours.

43:55.507 --> 43:59.678
Oh, no, acolyte, I modified the spell
so it will last a lifetime.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.014
Riches?

44:02.097 --> 44:03.682
Fame forever?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.062
Lay it on me.

44:08.687 --> 44:09.647
What is this?

44:20.949 --> 44:25.454
<i>Oculi veteres. Forma nova aeternum.</i>

44:31.919 --> 44:33.754
You may remove the hood.

44:41.762 --> 44:46.225
Fuuuuck!

44:51.605 --> 44:53.065
Your name is Alyssa Drake.

44:53.732 --> 44:55.401
You go to Belgrave University.

44:55.818 --> 44:56.819
Forget the Order.

44:57.528 --> 44:58.529
Forget the Knights.

45:00.322 --> 45:01.573
Forget Jack Morton.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.576
Hey. Hey.

45:05.786 --> 45:06.620
You okay?

45:07.830 --> 45:08.706
Come on.

45:10.332 --> 45:13.127
I think you must have had
low blood sugar or something.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.008
Do we have

45:20.759 --> 45:21.927
class together?

45:22.594 --> 45:23.512
I wish.

45:25.597 --> 45:26.932
I would've remembered you.

45:44.658 --> 45:46.660
This looks all in order.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.246
We, uh, removed the dress code.

45:50.748 --> 45:51.623
Now, then.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.167
Your first assignment.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.460
Rescuing Lilith.

45:54.543 --> 45:57.171
Yes, Mr. Carpio, all in good time.

45:57.629 --> 46:01.884
Unfortunately, the grimoire detailing
any possible rescue is still missing.

46:01.967 --> 46:02.801
So...

46:03.635 --> 46:05.053
until we find it,

46:05.721 --> 46:07.055
I have your first task.

46:07.639 --> 46:10.893
The original Knights of the Blue Rose

46:10.976 --> 46:13.812
guarded the Vade Maecum
for their Grand Magus.

46:15.230 --> 46:18.317
They saw how it twisted him,

46:18.984 --> 46:23.405
how it perverted his ambitions,
and they took it away from him.

46:24.865 --> 46:27.326
They tried to destroy it,

46:27.910 --> 46:32.748
but it will do anything
to stay in existence.

46:34.124 --> 46:36.168
I have already had a taste of its lure,

46:37.044 --> 46:38.462
and I cannot...

46:39.379 --> 46:41.799
allow it to tempt me any further. So...

46:44.134 --> 46:46.678
for your first official duty...

46:47.471 --> 46:48.430
please...

46:49.932 --> 46:52.893
tear apart this book.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.063
And for the love of God...

46:57.231 --> 46:59.983
never tell me where you hide it.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.654
Thank you, Grand Magus.

47:04.404 --> 47:05.280
On three.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.449
One, two, three.

47:11.620 --> 47:12.663
Magus.

47:14.331 --> 47:15.624
Find Alyssa.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.584
Now.

47:20.003 --> 47:21.797
Can I keep this risotto recipe?

47:29.054 --> 47:29.888
You were right.

47:31.014 --> 47:31.890
About everything?

47:32.599 --> 47:33.809
Ninety percent.

47:33.892 --> 47:36.979
Mmm. Even necromancy has some gray areas.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.857
Yeah, I guess it keeps things interesting.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.569
Thanks for protecting my memories.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.196
I told you you'd like my risotto.

47:49.533 --> 47:50.659
You ready to do this?

47:55.372 --> 47:56.707
Yeah, I'm ready.

48:00.127 --> 48:01.128
As for this...

48:01.211 --> 48:02.546
That's yours, remember?

48:03.130 --> 48:04.298
I want us to share it.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.301
Alyssa Drake!

48:07.384 --> 48:09.261
You and I are going to stir shit up.

48:10.137 --> 48:11.346
Suits me.

48:11.930 --> 48:13.932
You know the Vade Maecum can't burn,
right?

48:14.016 --> 48:14.850
I know.

48:15.726 --> 48:16.560
You didn't.

48:17.644 --> 48:18.520
Didn't I?

48:25.360 --> 48:26.278
You okay?

48:30.407 --> 48:31.241
Fine.
