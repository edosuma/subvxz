WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:09.416
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:22.541 --> 00:24.083
My name is Maca.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.958
I'm 29 years old.

00:26.041 --> 00:29.458
I've spent 28 of those years as a loser,
but I'm evolving.

00:29.541 --> 00:30.750
I'm becoming…

00:33.291 --> 00:34.958
a cool girl.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.125
-I can't do it!
-Come on, Adri.

00:56.208 --> 01:00.208
-Are you shitting me? We're all doing it.
-What? It looks great like this.

01:01.541 --> 01:03.166
Looks like a pair of DDs.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.916
More like As.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.041
Honestly, I've never been a fan of pain.

01:09.125 --> 01:13.083
No pain like the pain of feeling weak.
You're not weak.

01:19.833 --> 01:20.666
Let's do this.

01:23.958 --> 01:28.291
Okay… I believe in love
more than anything.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.875
I believe in Julián, the family book,

01:31.958 --> 01:34.708
Sunday lunches with my mother-in-law,

01:34.791 --> 01:39.083
wedding anniversaries,
and I really believe in our mortgage.

01:43.541 --> 01:45.416
Now's not the time to get into it.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.666
Adriana already knows
what I think of her marriage.

01:50.958 --> 01:53.041
-Yeah, you like that?
-I love it.

01:53.541 --> 01:54.666
Come here, babe.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.791
No, don't worry about me. Cum.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.541
She's trying to convince us
that she could be asexual.

02:02.666 --> 02:06.541
Just because you said "I do"
doesn't mean you have to settle for less.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.875
I've told her
there's no way she's asexual.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.708
Is it true that
in some tribes in Papua New Guinea,

02:16.791 --> 02:19.166
tattoos are used to summon the dead?

02:19.250 --> 02:22.833
Jimena and Santi were dating the day
he crossed the street without looking.

02:22.916 --> 02:24.750
That was 11 years ago.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.791
I gotta choose
between the triple-camera one

02:27.875 --> 02:30.375
and the one with insane memory.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.250
What do you think?

02:32.333 --> 02:36.166
Since then, she's been obsessed
with Nesquik and seeing him again.

02:36.250 --> 02:40.166
Her latest attempt came from Indonesia.
Reincarnation salts.

02:40.666 --> 02:44.666
Santi's spirit is on the way
for 200 dollars plus shipping.

02:45.541 --> 02:49.416
Jime's convinced Santi will be back
in the flesh sooner or later,

02:49.500 --> 02:52.291
so she looks for him where the flesh is.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.958
But they always do or say something
Santi never would've.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.750
And then, of course,
the search begins again.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.000
I'm not perfect either.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.916
I wish I were more confident,
stronger, didn't care what people think.

03:08.708 --> 03:09.833
But I'm working on it.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.708
It was declined.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.958
-Shoot.
-Typical.

03:18.875 --> 03:21.125
Think of it as me
helping you become empowered.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.458
But he's cute. That's all I need.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.208
I see him once a week.

03:31.708 --> 03:36.208
We don't do movies
or shopping or dinners, none of that shit.

03:36.708 --> 03:39.666
It leaves me free to do my own thing.

03:39.750 --> 03:43.666
Being coupled up is like
being swallowed by a mental black hole.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.333
It's a distraction.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.083
I go out on my own,
and I have sex with him.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.958
Don't get me wrong.
I used to be a hopeless romantic, but then

03:57.041 --> 03:58.000
I saw the light.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.625
-Turn that off.
-What?

04:10.416 --> 04:11.791
Turn that off, dammit!

04:12.500 --> 04:14.291
Quick! Turn that off before--

04:47.333 --> 04:48.791
What the hell was that?

04:51.083 --> 04:52.875
I said I was working on it, okay?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.750
But it sucks
to always be talking about men.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.750
Let's talk about me.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.458
Watch it! The matcha
can't mix with the soy milk. Shit.

05:05.541 --> 05:06.583
Good morning.

05:06.666 --> 05:10.916
I've posted the photo I edited yesterday
with the hashtag #AdoptDontShop.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.958
And I got Andrés Sardá
to do your gown for the ceremony

05:14.041 --> 05:15.708
and ODYSSEY to do your makeup.

05:15.791 --> 05:18.125
And I'm finishing up your speech now.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.958
-As soon as it's done--
-Maca, what's this?

05:22.583 --> 05:26.125
-Your matcha.
-I told you about it in a voice message.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.958
-A voice message?
-Yes, sweetie, a voice message.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.000
At four in the morning.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.250
I'm trying a new diet.
No eating for 20 hours a day.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.250
What? Women in Kolkata have been doing it
for centuries. They look great.

05:42.166 --> 05:45.250
Are you sure they're choosing to fast?

05:45.333 --> 05:46.208
What?

05:47.500 --> 05:51.458
-Never mind. I'll have it.
-I don't want any temptations nearby.

05:51.541 --> 05:54.875
Okay? So, when you're with me,
you have to pretend you're fasting too.

05:54.958 --> 05:56.041
For solidarity.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.875
And Maca, I want you in heels.
You know that.

05:59.958 --> 06:02.083
Sometimes I just can't with you.

06:06.541 --> 06:09.125
I don't wear heels
because I refuse to get blisters

06:09.208 --> 06:12.916
for someone who pays me under the table,
makes me work weekends,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.208
and is now having me starve to death.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.333
How about a bit of respect?

06:22.500 --> 06:26.791
Let's talk about the ulcer I'm getting
from not daring to speak my mind to Pipa,

06:26.875 --> 06:29.000
my unbearable and tyrannical boss.

06:29.708 --> 06:34.250
But slaves don't complain,
and that's basically what I am to her.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.875
I started working for Pipa
a year and a half ago,

06:37.958 --> 06:40.416
when I didn't believe in myself at all.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.250
To be fair, she never lied to me.

06:42.958 --> 06:45.833
You'll do it all,
but you won't get any credit.

06:45.916 --> 06:48.791
Photos, writing, tying my shoelaces.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.125
I'll pay you very little.
I'll demand a lot.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.625
And I'll make you cry.

06:54.291 --> 06:57.916
But it won't be my fault.
I was diagnosed as a psychopath.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.583
So, I guess I couldn't care less
about your feelings.

07:06.666 --> 07:07.833
When can I start?

07:14.583 --> 07:18.125
Pipa is ninth
in the national ranking of influencers.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.125
She's gone up 12 positions
since last year.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.500
-Pipa!
-Pipa!

07:23.583 --> 07:25.916
She thinks it's the new vintage filter.

07:26.791 --> 07:29.416
But I think there's another reason for it.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.375
Pipa! Over here.

07:47.083 --> 07:51.708
And Best Communication
on Social Media goes to

07:52.791 --> 07:53.958
Pipa!

07:57.250 --> 07:58.416
Thank you.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.375
Thank you very much.

08:09.916 --> 08:11.958
I'm… a little nervous.

08:14.208 --> 08:17.875
Just one post
can reach thousands of people.

08:18.458 --> 08:23.125
We have the responsibility
and duty to change things.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.083
It's the art of communicating.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.125
Thank you to my followers
and all of you here today.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.250
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

08:35.291 --> 08:41.000
I never could have won this award
without the help of…

08:44.416 --> 08:47.791
My Boost-Up Serum Magic Fresh Light
by Ophalo.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.208
Available for 25 euros
in department stores. Thank you!

09:05.125 --> 09:06.250
Oh, shit.

09:16.625 --> 09:20.458
Hello? Is someone there?
Anyone have a tampon?

09:21.250 --> 09:23.458
Yeah. I've got something even better.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.625
I keep one of these on me to give away.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.666
Just try it. You'll love it. You'll see.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.500
I've been trying to use a cup for months,
but I can never get the hang of it.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.958
This is my brand, and they're easy to use.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.625
-Raquel?
-Yeah?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.375
Raquel, it's me, Maca.

09:45.458 --> 09:47.750
Maca, honey.

09:47.833 --> 09:50.333
Of course. I saw Pipa,
and I thought of you.

09:50.416 --> 09:51.750
About the cup, listen.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.750
Grab the wide part with your fingers.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.625
And it'll go in a lot easier. You'll see.

09:58.541 --> 09:59.375
All right.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.708
-Got it?
-Just a second. Let me try.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.208
Okay.

10:07.208 --> 10:10.458
Yeah. It went in perfectly.

10:10.958 --> 10:14.125
-They're something else, right?
-They're wonderful.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.375
-Raquel.
-Maca.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.666
-You look great.
-Congrats on your awards.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.291
Thanks. It's always nice
to get recognition.

10:24.375 --> 10:27.583
-How are you?
-Swamped, as always.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.875
Pipa is such a diva.

10:30.375 --> 10:35.541
I keep telling you, with your potential,
agencies should be fighting over you.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.875
Yeah. I just don't know
if that's what I want.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.458
Well, you certainly don't want
to be exploited.

10:40.541 --> 10:41.708
No, definitely not.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.625
It's time you made new contacts.

10:47.541 --> 10:49.875
-Stand up for yourself.
-For me? Really?

10:49.958 --> 10:51.291
You deserve it.

10:54.875 --> 10:55.833
Thanks.

10:56.958 --> 10:59.708
Well, I'm off.
This is a snoozefest, and I have a date.

10:59.791 --> 11:01.583
-Have fun!
-Thanks.

11:01.666 --> 11:03.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.166
Pipa!

11:52.250 --> 11:55.750
I put in tons of overtime
yesterday and the day before, so…

11:55.833 --> 11:56.666
So?

11:57.166 --> 12:00.416
So… I'm going home.
You'll have to get back on your own.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.916
And tomorrow, I'm coming in at 11:00.
No, 12:00.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.333
Oh, sweetie.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.916
-What?
-Look at your feet.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.583
You think that's okay?

12:10.666 --> 12:12.166
I ask you to dress well,

12:12.250 --> 12:15.000
and you pick today of all days
to publicly embarrass me.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.625
Well, Converse are in again.

12:17.708 --> 12:21.083
Yeah. If you're cool enough
to pull them off.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.500
Poor thing. She's clueless.

12:48.916 --> 12:51.250
Okay. They're expensive.
And I need the job.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.458
Plus, I can't afford to make a huge scene.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.500
Girls, you won't believe
what Pipa just did.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.625
She's the fucking worst.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.791
I was in the bathroom,
and I ran into Raquel,

13:03.875 --> 13:06.833
that influencer I told you about,
who's super nice.

13:07.416 --> 13:08.666
Raquel.

14:27.583 --> 14:28.708
Shit.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.541
Leo's back.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.041
And he's with Raquel.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.500
-What's your name?
-Macarena.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.541
Do you go by Maca or Macarena?

15:00.625 --> 15:01.583
Maca.

15:01.666 --> 15:04.666
Maca. I love that name, "Maca."
Here's to you, Maca.

15:06.416 --> 15:08.625
-And what's your name?
-I'm Leo.

15:11.916 --> 15:13.166
No toast for me, then?

15:19.625 --> 15:23.000
It was the deepest,
most passionate experience of my life.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.250
Since that first look.

15:38.583 --> 15:43.500
All the joy movies had promised me
seemed real and infinite.

15:48.625 --> 15:49.958
Okay, recite…

15:50.708 --> 15:52.750
Section 66, point two?

15:52.833 --> 15:56.833
"When there are
two or more mitigating circumstances,

15:56.916 --> 16:01.083
the court shall impose… the punishment
that is lesser by one or two degrees

16:01.166 --> 16:02.916
to that established by law."

16:17.833 --> 16:20.291
Maca, you know
I can't stand it when you do that.

16:20.375 --> 16:23.125
-I'm the one who can't stand you.
-No, I can't stand you.

16:23.541 --> 16:25.375
-You're such an idiot.
-Shut up.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.750
Our connection was intense.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.958
So intense.

16:33.666 --> 16:37.583
I felt like what we had was unique

16:37.666 --> 16:39.750
and could never be repeated
with anyone else.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.416
Ever.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.916
But one day, he disappeared.

16:49.416 --> 16:53.125
He up and left the life
we'd planned together.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.000
He never apologized.

17:00.458 --> 17:01.500
He just left.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.208
And I ended up stuck,
believing I'd never be happy without him.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.875
What are you guys doing here?

17:17.416 --> 17:20.166
-Come on.
-But… Close the door.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.833
-Let me guess, you haven't slept at all?
-All right. Who needs coffee?

17:24.916 --> 17:27.250
-No.
-No.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.833
-Maca, get up.
-Get up.

17:28.916 --> 17:31.333
-Help me, Adri.
-I'm fine. For real, okay?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.166
-But--
-Come on.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.500
-Now pants.
-All right. Come on.

17:36.583 --> 17:39.291
-Can't we just sleep for a teeny bit more?
-No.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.583
All right. Let's have breakfast.

17:44.833 --> 17:45.833
Excuse me.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.666
Carbs are good. Carbs are great.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.125
I put a hex on him
so he'd go back to Boston.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.958
-And get crabs. The cherry on top.
-I'm fine.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.333
Girls, I am fine.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.416
You sent this at four in the morning.
Wait till you hear what you sent at five.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.500
Well, okay.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.750
It wasn't my best night.

18:13.916 --> 18:14.875
Leo…

18:16.791 --> 18:21.375
Leo was an important person in my life,
and he left me with some… issues.

18:21.916 --> 18:23.291
Thanks.

18:25.791 --> 18:26.666
"Issues"?

18:27.791 --> 18:30.833
Okay, fine.
He gave me… fucking romantic PTSD.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.375
But now I see things differently.
I understand it.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.666
I know it's our immature society's fault

18:36.750 --> 18:39.250
for making us, especially women,
believe in fairy tales.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.166
You're handling it better this time.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.083
Someone who hurt me
and didn't even apologize

18:48.166 --> 18:49.958
doesn't deserve my attention.

18:50.041 --> 18:54.291
I'm still on my way to feeling confident.
This doesn't change a thing. Not a thing.

18:55.791 --> 18:56.625
How'd he look?

18:58.333 --> 19:00.375
Still got that hunter-gatherer ass?

19:00.458 --> 19:03.583
You help by comforting her.
I help by saying shit's gonna hit the fan.

19:03.666 --> 19:06.208
Jime, I'm the new Maca.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.458
I'm Maca 2.0.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.375
Trust me.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.875
You know you need to shower, right?

19:13.958 --> 19:15.083
-Yeah. I will.
-Yeah.

19:16.208 --> 19:17.166
All right.

19:17.708 --> 19:18.916
Bye, girls.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.541
-Take care of yourself.
-Shower.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.500
-Thanks.
-You're such a bitch.

19:24.208 --> 19:25.583
-Bye, Maca.
-Bye.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.000
Did you buy what she said about Leo?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.625
She had 12 churros
and hot chocolate. She's fine.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.625
Are you for real? "Maca 2.0"?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.166
-Adri, come on.
-Jime.

19:37.250 --> 19:40.208
-She's not even Maca 1.5.
-People can change.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.208
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

19:41.291 --> 19:44.375
Well, maybe you'll surprise us
and turn into a sex maniac.

19:45.708 --> 19:46.541
Oh!

19:52.041 --> 19:52.875
How about you?

19:52.958 --> 19:55.666
-Thought about seeing a psychologist?
-What?

19:56.958 --> 19:57.833
Jime.

19:59.125 --> 20:03.208
You're unbelievable.
Jime! Where are you going?

20:04.416 --> 20:06.041
I can't believe this.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.041
Excuse me.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.458
It's an emergency.

20:41.416 --> 20:42.750
My back.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.708
-It's killing me.
-Do you have an appointment?

20:47.208 --> 20:51.166
No. It just happened today.
I woke up like this.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.375
I need to be seen
by the guy who just came in.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.750
-Samuel?
-Yes.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.166
Yeah, Samuel.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.083
I mean, Samu.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.708
Are you a patient of his,
a relative, a friend?

21:01.208 --> 21:03.541
No. Not yet.

21:03.625 --> 21:06.791
You'll have to make an appointment.
We don't handle emergencies.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.166
Please, it's important.

21:09.250 --> 21:13.000
-We're all booked--
-Samuel! I need you to check out… my back.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.625
It's killing me.

21:14.708 --> 21:18.583
-I can barely walk or do anything.
-Do you have an appointment?

21:18.666 --> 21:21.166
-No. She just showed up.
-Get her info.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.500
We'll give you
the first opening we have this week. Okay?

21:27.541 --> 21:29.291
Hey, calm down.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.083
I can take a quick look.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.416
-Head on in.
-Okay.

21:34.291 --> 21:37.541
-If José Luis comes, ask him to wait.
-All right.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.125
Tell me what's going on.
I didn't quite get it.

21:44.208 --> 21:47.541
Okay. Well, look, my entire back hurts.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.041
All of it.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.625
From top to bottom.

21:52.583 --> 21:53.500
Even here.

21:54.708 --> 21:58.791
This is where it hurts the most.
I can barely sit in a chair.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.416
-All right.
-Here, my butt.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.750
The sacrum, then?

22:01.833 --> 22:04.875
-Sacrum, butt, whatever.
-Let's take a look.

22:04.958 --> 22:05.791
Okay.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.208
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah?

22:17.291 --> 22:22.250
Does the name… Santi Asenjo… ring a bell?

22:22.333 --> 22:23.875
-Who?
-Oh, right.

22:23.958 --> 22:27.041
When someone is reincarnated,
they don't know it.

22:27.125 --> 22:30.750
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's see. Hold on.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.791
If I press here, does it hurt?

22:32.875 --> 22:36.166
-You're not groaning as much as before.
-Let's see.

22:38.041 --> 22:40.166
-Does that hurt?
-It hurts a lot.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.250
-All right.
-Yeah, it really does.

22:44.625 --> 22:48.250
Even if you don't remember him,
I bet you like the same stuff.

22:48.333 --> 22:52.041
You must remember Aragorn's sword
in the battle of Morannon.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.750
"I bid you stand, Men of the East!"

22:55.250 --> 22:57.750
-Take a deep breath in for me, okay?
-Sure.

22:59.875 --> 23:00.958
Let it out.

23:06.541 --> 23:07.708
Holy shit!

23:10.291 --> 23:14.375
That's all the time I have.
Have Marta schedule you for this week.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.041
-Your back's a mess.
-Sure.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.166
-Okay?
-Okay.

23:19.250 --> 23:23.291
And it's, "I bid you stand,
Men of the West." Okay?

23:27.208 --> 23:28.041
Hell yes!

23:41.791 --> 23:43.375
Hello. Can I help you?

23:44.375 --> 23:45.708
Can I help you?

23:45.791 --> 23:47.291
No, can I help you?

23:48.583 --> 23:50.041
What do you want, ma'am?

23:55.083 --> 23:59.333
-Do you have a problem with my heels?
-No. Don't get me wrong.

23:59.416 --> 24:02.916
Don't get yourself wrong, honey.
I see you judging me.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.125
Not at all. I've always
admired people who wear heels.

24:06.208 --> 24:09.416
Right. This is the part where you tell me
you have tons of gay friends.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.958
As a matter of fact, I do.
I have lots of them. Excuse me.

24:13.041 --> 24:15.166
Typical fake liberal.

24:16.375 --> 24:18.666
Pipa, you got a new assistant?

24:19.375 --> 24:24.125
-Figured it would take you down a notch.
-All I did was set some limits.

24:25.375 --> 24:28.916
I don't know how things work in Lavapiés,
but here, the boss does that.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.958
And Luigi actually values
this job opportunity.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.750
So, you're an intern? Is she paying you?

24:47.833 --> 24:49.541
Her work drives me crazy.

24:51.833 --> 24:57.041
Do you know about trip planning,
scheduling, contacting brands,

24:57.125 --> 25:00.250
social media management,
positioning tricks, metrics,

25:00.333 --> 25:03.125
long-term planning,
photography, and editing?

25:05.375 --> 25:06.291
Of course.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.833
Got a survival kit?

25:16.000 --> 25:19.083
Double-sided tape?
It's a must-have. Especially with Pipa.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.333
What was your name again?

25:36.625 --> 25:38.250
Here's the dress.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.958
You'll look stunning, promise.

25:44.625 --> 25:46.333
Tell me if you need anything.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.333
Hey, listen. I was thinking,
have you tried sex in parking lots?

25:53.083 --> 25:54.791
Parking lots. Not a bad idea.

25:56.958 --> 26:01.583
We've tried tantra,
costumes, even that thing with ropes.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.958
The other day, we pretended
we were strangers at a bar.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.083
And did it work?

26:10.250 --> 26:13.375
-Maca, what if we try a threesome?
-Really?

26:13.458 --> 26:16.583
Why not? It could be a good incentive.

26:17.083 --> 26:20.041
But… what if Julián
falls for the other girl?

26:20.125 --> 26:23.625
Or would it be with a guy?
What if he falls for the guy?

26:29.125 --> 26:30.166
What's wrong?

26:30.750 --> 26:32.625
Look. Look at this.

26:32.708 --> 26:36.875
-Okay. Don't panic. Let's take a look.
-My wedding's this Saturday.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.833
I've been sticking to the diet.
I don't get it!

26:39.916 --> 26:42.208
It's just the stress. Don't worry.

26:42.708 --> 26:45.000
Well, now I really am stressed!

26:45.500 --> 26:47.833
But what's the problem?

26:47.916 --> 26:51.458
I need to lose four damn pounds,
and my wedding's in four days.

26:51.541 --> 26:53.958
Well, I think you look great.

26:54.041 --> 26:57.416
Really. And your fiancé
won't care about those four extra pounds.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.916
Or will he?

27:00.416 --> 27:02.250
-Do you think he will?
-Yeah.

27:02.333 --> 27:06.125
Well, look.
If he cares, you're off to a bad start.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.208
Why?

27:07.291 --> 27:10.000
What'll happen
when you start getting wrinkles?

27:10.083 --> 27:13.958
Or your body isn't what it used to be
after your first pregnancy?

27:14.041 --> 27:16.708
If that's the case,
I'd say he's not worth it.

27:16.791 --> 27:19.375
Better to realize it
before you get married.

27:19.458 --> 27:22.666
There's nothing wrong with you.
He's the problem.

27:22.750 --> 27:23.875
What?

27:24.375 --> 27:25.916
It's better to be alone--

27:26.000 --> 27:29.583
Maca! Wait here.
We'll continue this conversation later.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.125
No. Don't worry.

27:33.208 --> 27:37.375
We'll go to the dressmaker this afternoon
and get it fixed right away.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.916
You'll look stunning. You'll see.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.000
WANNA FCK?

27:54.791 --> 27:56.416
-Maca.
-What?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.750
-Why don't we go to my place?
-No.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.750
-I always cramp up in here.
-No.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.666
Your place is like a dorm,
and I always end up cleaning it.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.208
What kind of excuse is that?

28:09.083 --> 28:10.416
-Maca.
-What?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.333
Maybe we're not on the same page?

28:14.500 --> 28:16.791
-I'm sure of that.
-Maybe you're feeling stuff?

28:16.875 --> 28:18.958
-What are you talking about?
-No? Okay.

28:24.541 --> 28:26.416
Maca, babe. How are you?

28:26.500 --> 28:29.916
My eco art exhibition
is opening this Saturday.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.916
The media will be there,
and so will tons of people from the scene.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.333
People who'd for sure
be interested in hiring you.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.791
And I'd love to have you there.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.000
Come on.

28:41.083 --> 28:44.041
I really think it's time you left Pipa.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.458
Let me know if you can make it. Kisses.

28:50.416 --> 28:53.125
CRAPPY DECISION

29:07.000 --> 29:08.291
We have to go.

29:09.125 --> 29:12.958
If work is my top priority right now,
I have to accept the invite.

29:13.041 --> 29:14.541
It's a great opportunity.

29:14.625 --> 29:18.166
No way. Leo will be there.
Find a job some other way.

29:28.708 --> 29:31.583
I need all of Raquel's contacts.

29:32.125 --> 29:36.875
You're mature enough to know
it would be a disaster.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.875
There's life beyond Raquel's contacts.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.916
Mature? The problem is
Leo always ends up dictating my life.

29:44.916 --> 29:47.000
I abandoned myself to focus on him.

29:47.083 --> 29:51.041
Will I still take him into account
when making decisions about my life?

30:37.875 --> 30:38.750
Excuse me.

30:42.250 --> 30:43.208
Maca?

30:45.625 --> 30:46.458
Leo.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.208
What are…?

30:48.833 --> 30:51.083
-Here with your new girlfriend?
-What?

30:53.583 --> 30:54.583
Why are you here?

30:55.250 --> 31:00.250
Networking so I can leave my shitty job.
Raquel's the sweetest.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.875
-Wait. How do you…?
-Hey.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.208
Wow, you two know each other?

31:05.291 --> 31:06.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

31:06.333 --> 31:10.541
-Yeah, we were…
-Yeah, we dated for a while years ago.

31:11.041 --> 31:12.875
I'll have to hear all his secrets, then.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.708
Not necessary.
I bet she barely remembers me.

31:15.791 --> 31:19.125
Raquel? What a wonderful display.
Who's the artist?

31:19.208 --> 31:20.041
"For a while"?

31:20.125 --> 31:23.458
I'll introduce you to him.
Sure. Want to meet the artist?

31:23.541 --> 31:25.166
-Sure. Yeah.
-Great.

31:32.416 --> 31:33.416
Thanks.

31:43.958 --> 31:47.625
-How are you doing? Having fun?
-Are you?

31:49.291 --> 31:51.708
So, what's this
about you looking for a job here?

31:51.791 --> 31:53.875
It's… strange.

31:54.375 --> 31:57.125
What's strange
is you dating an influencer.

31:57.916 --> 32:02.416
So, you didn't go into law?
After that effort to learn the penal code…

32:02.500 --> 32:05.750
Well, we tend
to waste our time when we're young.

32:07.708 --> 32:08.791
And yourself?

32:08.875 --> 32:12.416
This doesn't seem like
a bohemian philologist's scene.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.125
I'm a college professor now.
I came back to Madrid to teach.

32:17.625 --> 32:21.208
Leo the civil servant?
May all your big dreams rest in peace.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.083
Yeah, at least I had dreams.

32:26.291 --> 32:31.083
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best
with your classes, Raquel, all of it.

32:32.041 --> 32:34.708
Maca, can we talk like adults?

32:34.791 --> 32:37.250
Sure. Of course we can.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.708
How's being back in Madrid?

32:40.750 --> 32:43.500
Great. I found an apartment
in the city center.

32:43.583 --> 32:45.875
-Really? Where?
-In Chamberí.

32:45.958 --> 32:47.458
-Wow.
-What?

32:47.541 --> 32:50.625
-Considering how bad teachers have it…
-I've been tenured.

32:51.625 --> 32:55.916
I'm glad your life's been a straight path
to success, no ups and downs.

32:56.666 --> 32:58.958
Am I detecting a smidge of sarcasm?

32:59.041 --> 33:01.375
What do you mean? I've grown up too.

33:01.458 --> 33:05.666
Yeah? I don't think so.
Your eyes tell me you haven't changed.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.291
You're the one who hasn't changed,

33:07.375 --> 33:09.875
the guy who ruins someone's life
and never apologizes.

33:09.958 --> 33:13.750
-Then time goes by, and we're friends?
-It's been years.

33:14.250 --> 33:15.875
Get over it already, okay?

33:18.458 --> 33:20.583
What do you want me to say?
That I'm a jerk?

33:20.666 --> 33:23.541
Fine. I'm a jerk,
and I'll always be one. That better?

33:31.083 --> 33:33.875
Running away like a coward,
your specialty.

33:52.458 --> 33:54.791
He's a cutie, isn't he? Leo.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.416
Yeah, he's a cutie. Were you really close?

33:57.500 --> 34:02.416
-No. We were only together for five years.
-Five years? But didn't he say--?

34:02.500 --> 34:06.500
Yeah. Leo's a free spirit.
Always saying one thing and doing another.

34:07.416 --> 34:08.958
What do you mean?

34:10.208 --> 34:13.458
To be clear,
I want to screw him over

34:13.541 --> 34:16.958
because it's not fair that things
are going so well for him.

34:17.041 --> 34:18.875
But I also want to rescue her.

34:18.958 --> 34:22.166
Wouldn't you warn someone
before they fell into a well?

34:22.666 --> 34:27.291
I wish someone had given me
that spoiler back then. Sisterhood.

34:28.541 --> 34:33.166
Well, he threw my heart onto the floor
and then danced on it

34:33.250 --> 34:35.916
until it was nothing but trampled mush.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.791
-But what happened?
-He's the biggest asshole I've ever met.

34:41.875 --> 34:45.375
He threw me away like I was nothing.
He destroyed my future.

34:45.458 --> 34:50.208
I'll just give you one piece of advice.
Run. Run away and never look back.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.958
Oops, I gotta go. It's getting late.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.583
Everything okay?

34:59.916 --> 35:03.500
-How are you doing this week, Jimena?
-Great, actually.

35:04.333 --> 35:08.708
I managed to get the first encyclopedia
of paranormal phenomena published.

35:08.791 --> 35:12.708
That's great,
but I meant in terms of your back.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.041
My back?

35:15.750 --> 35:18.000
-Not good. My back hurts.
-Okay.

35:18.791 --> 35:19.791
Good.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.833
Turn your head to the right, slowly.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.208
Okay. Now to the left.

35:26.875 --> 35:27.750
Okay.

35:31.083 --> 35:32.458
Do you believe in love?

35:36.416 --> 35:39.625
-What kind of question is that?
-I don't know. Just a question.

35:39.708 --> 35:43.041
It's a question
for your psychologist or your friend,

35:43.125 --> 35:44.916
not your physical therapist.

35:50.125 --> 35:54.000
Know why I'm really here?
My back does happen to be killing me.

35:54.541 --> 35:59.791
But what I'd really like is to…
have a drink with you.

36:03.666 --> 36:06.666
The thing is,
I don't date my patients, Jimena.

36:07.458 --> 36:11.291
-But we really vibe, Samuel.
-Yeah. That's true.

36:11.375 --> 36:12.458
So?

36:13.166 --> 36:16.625
I don't know. It'd be weird
for us to go out for a drink.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.833
Why? It's a drink. Just one drink.

36:20.916 --> 36:22.416
-Just one drink.
-Yeah.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.708
-That does sound good.
-Of course it does.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.166
All right. One drink.

36:29.916 --> 36:31.875
One drink, and then…

36:32.375 --> 36:35.916
-And then we'll see what happens.
-Right.

36:36.416 --> 36:37.458
We'll see.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.875
Don't laugh,
but I could really go for some Nesquik.

36:56.416 --> 36:57.500
What?

37:18.666 --> 37:19.541
Well…

37:22.666 --> 37:23.833
A toast?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.958
-To tonight.
-To tonight.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.166
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

37:50.416 --> 37:51.250
Come here.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.125
Come here.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.000
-Macarena Bartual?
-Yeah, that's me.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.041
YOUR DIGNITY WILL REMEMBER YOU

39:40.791 --> 39:42.250
Sorry for your loss.

39:47.208 --> 39:48.541
DEAR MACARENA,

39:48.625 --> 39:52.500
MY MOST SINCERE CONDOLENCES
FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR WILLPOWER.

39:52.583 --> 39:54.875
WARM REGARDS, LEO
P.S. FUCK YOU

40:05.750 --> 40:09.708
SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES

40:28.458 --> 40:30.041
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

40:30.125 --> 40:33.250
Okay, let's get to it.
I'm going to have you write a paper.

40:33.958 --> 40:34.875
-Yes.
-No.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.875
I want you to reflect on amour fou.

40:38.958 --> 40:41.041
The insanity of love.

40:41.125 --> 40:44.125
You mean,
falling for someone big time, right?

40:44.208 --> 40:48.458
Falling for someone, not being able
to tell expectations from reality.

40:49.041 --> 40:53.333
Authors from this period describe
a woman's experience of love as…

40:53.416 --> 40:54.333
agonizing.

40:54.416 --> 40:57.458
Love was even depicted
almost like a mental illness.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.125
And perhaps it was.

40:59.208 --> 41:03.416
Honestly, I expected more sensitivity
from a literature professor.

41:06.416 --> 41:07.250
What are you…?

41:08.916 --> 41:09.750
I'm sorry?

41:09.833 --> 41:11.916
I mean, you read and analyze a lot,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
but it seems
you don't quite grasp human emotions.

41:15.833 --> 41:18.958
Sorry, but we're not debating
my emotional competence.

41:19.041 --> 41:22.500
Of course not.
You can't debate what doesn't exist.

41:22.583 --> 41:24.208
All right. Just a minute.

41:24.291 --> 41:29.583
I'm talking about a specific period
in 19th-century literature.

41:29.666 --> 41:33.708
By saying that women
were crazy with love, right?

41:33.791 --> 41:36.041
Without clarifying
it isn't intrinsic to them,

41:36.125 --> 41:37.666
without providing context.

41:38.625 --> 41:42.625
That's what's in the books.
This is literature class, not history.

41:42.708 --> 41:45.791
You should adopt a more critical,
less complaisant approach.

41:46.375 --> 41:47.916
She's right.

41:50.666 --> 41:54.750
-Why are you in my class?
-I'm new. Auditing. Check your roster.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.166
No need for that.

41:57.250 --> 42:00.375
Look, this has nothing to do
with my personal beliefs.

42:00.458 --> 42:04.250
In fact, I'm a feminist
and fully in favor of gender equality.

42:04.333 --> 42:08.458
But? Come on, man.
Don't try to take us for a ride.

42:09.166 --> 42:11.333
If you're presenting
a way of explaining love

42:11.416 --> 42:13.333
that's more damaging to women,

42:13.416 --> 42:16.333
we need to condemn it
for leading us to where we are now.

42:16.416 --> 42:19.583
In bad shape,
carrying too much cultural baggage.

42:19.666 --> 42:21.458
-That's true!
-Right on!

42:22.708 --> 42:25.166
Just a minute.

42:25.250 --> 42:26.166
Care to tell me

42:26.250 --> 42:30.791
how the way I explain a literary period
is related to problems you face today?

42:30.875 --> 42:33.458
Cultural pressure on romance
compels us to believe

42:33.541 --> 42:36.416
we need the first charming asshole
we meet.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.375
Exactly!

42:39.333 --> 42:42.416
Hey! Don't worry.
It's so much less common now.

42:42.500 --> 42:46.208
Whoever you're with will see you
for what you are and dump you.

42:48.208 --> 42:50.375
Screw this paper you assigned.

42:50.458 --> 42:52.375
Screw it!

42:52.458 --> 42:54.625
Hey! We can't just leave it at that.

42:54.708 --> 42:58.083
Let's go to the department head
and protest this sexism.

42:58.166 --> 43:01.208
Get your testosterone out of our brains!

43:02.041 --> 43:05.125
Get your testosterone out of our brains!

43:06.208 --> 43:07.250
Fine.

43:09.083 --> 43:12.416
Get your testosterone out of our brains!

43:14.125 --> 43:15.416
That's fine.

43:16.291 --> 43:19.833
Let me remind you, if you leave,
you'll be considered absent.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.458
And the paper's still due.

43:30.291 --> 43:32.000
What the hell's wrong with you?

43:32.083 --> 43:33.750
First, you tell Raquel lies about me

43:33.833 --> 43:35.958
and now I can tell
she doesn't trust me at all.

43:36.041 --> 43:37.458
I haven't even gotten started.

43:37.541 --> 43:40.541
And now you're turning my class
against me. Why?

43:40.625 --> 43:44.208
What about the wreath?
That was a dick move, and you know it.

43:44.291 --> 43:45.666
The wreath…

43:45.750 --> 43:47.708
Look, Maca, we need to stop.

43:47.791 --> 43:52.708
It's absurd. It's getting us nowhere.
And beyond that… At our age, it's…

43:52.791 --> 43:55.458
I hate when you talk to me
with such contempt.

43:55.541 --> 43:59.750
As if it was my fault that I was hurt
or that I loved you so much, but…

43:59.833 --> 44:01.000
I wish I hadn't.

44:04.291 --> 44:05.958
You could try to understand.

44:07.541 --> 44:10.583
But never mind, I guess.
I shouldn't care about it.

44:12.833 --> 44:14.041
But you do care.

44:15.875 --> 44:17.375
I care too.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Because, in the end, only we know
how we feel for each other.

44:22.083 --> 44:24.500
How we felt, Leo. Don't get it wrong.

44:27.333 --> 44:29.416
Maca, you drive me insane, but…

44:32.083 --> 44:33.416
I want to kiss you.

44:36.458 --> 44:38.250
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

44:39.750 --> 44:41.541
You want to kiss me too.

44:42.666 --> 44:43.833
I can feel it.

44:46.333 --> 44:50.250
You're a conceited asshole.
Stop fucking with me.

44:52.166 --> 44:56.291
I'd love to fuck you, right here.
On top of the desk.

45:00.166 --> 45:03.208
Of course you would. Very much.

45:03.916 --> 45:06.708
Because you've obviously missed me.

45:10.416 --> 45:12.791
You're so close I can smell you.

45:54.291 --> 45:55.333
Now we're tied.

45:56.833 --> 45:57.916
What?

45:58.750 --> 45:59.791
Two, two.

46:03.541 --> 46:04.541
I hate you.

46:05.458 --> 46:09.500
Hey, Maca, don't be like that.
That's what we're doing, right?

46:09.583 --> 46:12.250
You did just humiliate me
in front of my class.

46:12.333 --> 46:13.541
It's not the same thing.

46:15.916 --> 46:16.791
Maca…

46:33.416 --> 46:35.250
INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS

46:50.416 --> 46:52.083
I'm trying him again.

46:53.416 --> 46:55.375
He's probably stuck in traffic.

47:18.083 --> 47:21.916
FOR RENT

47:37.500 --> 47:39.666
Maca!

47:41.666 --> 47:43.666
We have to go over the Milan itinerary.

47:43.750 --> 47:46.791
-It's gonna be an intense two days.
-You got that right.

47:47.291 --> 47:51.000
Did you update my relaxation app?
I can't board if you didn't.

47:51.083 --> 47:53.375
-It's handled.
-That's great, sweetie.

47:59.375 --> 48:02.166
Maca, how can we not have time
for more fashion shows?

48:02.250 --> 48:03.833
Are you sure this is right?

48:03.916 --> 48:06.458
There's too much time for meals.

48:06.541 --> 48:09.625
Change it however you want,
but fix it. Okay?

48:12.791 --> 48:13.708
Here goes.

48:14.791 --> 48:19.541
Hey, Pipa, about what happened
at the event the other night.

48:19.625 --> 48:22.458
-With the shoes…
-Please get to the point.

48:22.541 --> 48:24.625
Well, you should show me more respect

48:24.708 --> 48:27.083
and not embarrass me
in front of your friends.

48:27.166 --> 48:28.791
-Is that what I did?
-Yes.

48:28.875 --> 48:31.291
And I can only take so much, you know?

48:31.375 --> 48:33.833
Yeah. Maca, it's not so easy being me.

48:36.041 --> 48:36.875
Okay.

48:38.875 --> 48:41.750
-Maca, what's happening?
-It's turbulence. Relax.

48:41.833 --> 48:43.500
-Go ask.
-Okay, I'm going.

48:44.250 --> 48:46.083
-Return to your seats.
-Sorry.

48:46.166 --> 48:50.375
Oh, God. I don't want to die.

48:50.958 --> 48:52.875
I can't get it to fasten.

48:55.375 --> 48:56.583
Maca, I'm so scared.

48:56.666 --> 48:59.625
How do you think
I'll be remembered if I die here?

48:59.708 --> 49:02.333
I want to be an icon.

49:03.833 --> 49:06.083
Inhale. Exhale.

49:06.166 --> 49:09.166
Maca, you need to record this. Come on.

49:10.958 --> 49:14.916
Let's get my hair a bit messier.
I want it to be kind of shocking.

49:15.833 --> 49:17.500
-How's this?
-Great.

49:17.583 --> 49:20.916
Hi! We're here on a plane,
and it could be going down.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.833
If something happens,
I want you to know that I love you all

49:23.916 --> 49:25.333
and that I'm thinking of you.

49:25.416 --> 49:29.041
And you can upload a video
with the hashtag #WeAreAllPipa.

49:29.125 --> 49:30.583
We are all Pipa!

49:31.750 --> 49:33.416
-Done?
-Yeah.

49:34.625 --> 49:36.291
Oh, this just won't end.

49:38.041 --> 49:39.875
Oh, Maca, I'm so scared.

49:51.250 --> 49:53.416
Unbelievable. What are you doing here?

49:53.500 --> 49:55.708
We're really nose-diving, huh?

49:55.791 --> 49:58.041
You're thinking of me
in your final moments.

49:58.125 --> 50:01.041
Not your parents, Jime,
Adriana, or world peace.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.125
Just me.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.458
Lately, I only think about
how much I hate you.

50:05.458 --> 50:07.791
The fact is, you only think about me.

50:09.041 --> 50:11.125
Is there a last wish I can grant for you?

50:11.208 --> 50:14.333
A kiss? Or, if you want,
we can bang in the bathroom.

50:14.416 --> 50:15.500
It's up to you.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.125
What are you doing?

50:39.208 --> 50:40.416
Maca, open up!

50:44.541 --> 50:45.375
Maca!

50:49.833 --> 50:52.625
Don't give me those looks. He deserves it.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.791
You're so weird lately.

50:58.583 --> 51:00.625
Post my video as soon as we land.

51:08.291 --> 51:09.833
But you landed safely?

51:09.916 --> 51:11.916
Yeah, it was just a scare.

51:12.916 --> 51:16.833
-I think it was an astral journey.
-I think you hyperventilated.

51:16.916 --> 51:18.875
The important thing is I locked him away.

51:18.958 --> 51:20.708
He disappeared.

51:20.791 --> 51:23.708
That's the problem.
You locked him away, but he's still there.

51:23.791 --> 51:28.916
You should've thrown him out of the plane.
What happened the last time you saw him?

51:35.916 --> 51:39.333
It doesn't matter. It was… the last time.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.500
To the last time!

51:42.583 --> 51:44.916
-To the last time!
-To the last time!

51:47.666 --> 51:49.583
What about you guys? What's new?

51:49.666 --> 51:52.166
How about you?
How's life post-threesome?

51:53.500 --> 51:55.208
Fine, but nothing special.

51:55.291 --> 51:56.750
Nothing special? Really?

51:56.833 --> 52:01.500
You try pussy for the first time,
and that's all you say? What the hell?

52:01.583 --> 52:04.291
-I'm not gonna go into details.
-You should!

52:05.291 --> 52:06.250
No.

52:07.041 --> 52:09.500
So, with the hot girl, it was just okay.

52:09.583 --> 52:11.250
But how'd it go with Julián?

52:43.333 --> 52:47.000
I feel like… we're getting the spark back.

52:47.083 --> 52:48.500
We turn each other on.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.458
Messing around was good for us.

52:51.541 --> 52:54.166
Because that's all it was.
Just messing around.

52:54.666 --> 52:56.083
I wouldn't have made that bet.

52:56.166 --> 52:59.791
I really thought you were tired of him,
that it couldn't be fixed.

53:00.708 --> 53:02.625
-Tired of Julián?
-Yeah.

53:03.583 --> 53:06.250
Girls, Julián is my family.

53:06.333 --> 53:09.250
The last thing I want is to leave him.

53:09.333 --> 53:11.208
To throw away the life we've built,

53:11.291 --> 53:14.708
to find a new place to rent,
to take selfies for Tinder…

53:15.750 --> 53:16.708
No, thanks.

53:17.708 --> 53:19.875
How are things
with your physical therapist?

53:20.875 --> 53:21.916
It didn't work out.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.875
-What?
-But you were so good together.

53:23.958 --> 53:24.791
Yeah.

53:25.458 --> 53:28.625
But then something… went seriously wrong.

53:29.125 --> 53:29.958
Jime.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.583
You won't believe
what one of my patients gave me.

53:34.958 --> 53:38.958
Isn't he adorable?
You can name him if you want.

53:41.875 --> 53:46.416
-You ended it because he likes hamsters?
-He really likes them. He's obsessed.

53:46.500 --> 53:49.541
This is the first relationship
you've had that lasted over a month.

53:49.625 --> 53:51.083
And the sex was great.

53:52.125 --> 53:54.375
Yeah, but...

53:55.458 --> 53:58.291
he's so into hamsters.
So into them.

53:59.166 --> 54:01.250
Adri, he obviously wasn't Santi.

54:01.791 --> 54:03.750
I have to keep looking. That's it.

54:06.958 --> 54:08.000
I gotta pee.

54:13.333 --> 54:14.833
She went to cry in there.

54:16.291 --> 54:19.125
And if she keeps this up…
she's gonna die alone.

54:20.083 --> 54:21.000
Or maybe not.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.875
-Good afternoon. Jimena?
-Yes.

54:39.958 --> 54:41.208
Can I come in?

54:42.916 --> 54:43.750
Yeah.

54:49.125 --> 54:51.583
This is more than enough
to get you started.

54:51.666 --> 54:54.541
I'm not sure
I can pretend to be somebody else.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.375
What do you think acting is?

54:56.458 --> 54:58.666
Sharing dog shelter posts
and going gluten-free?

54:59.750 --> 55:02.125
Besides, in your ad,
you said you loved a challenge.

55:02.208 --> 55:06.875
Well, I meant, like,
pretending I'm disabled or Norwegian.

55:06.958 --> 55:09.041
What you're asking for
is straight-up crazy.

55:10.666 --> 55:13.333
Hey, Santi broke his wrist skateboarding
three times.

55:13.416 --> 55:15.458
-Yeah.
-Does that work for you?

55:15.541 --> 55:17.041
Is she really gonna believe this?

55:17.125 --> 55:20.500
Well, Jime's had
a complicated relationship with logic

55:20.583 --> 55:21.750
for the last 11 years.

55:22.458 --> 55:25.583
She'll believe you're Santi.
Then you can say goodbye to her forever.

55:25.666 --> 55:27.708
You'll be setting her free.

55:27.791 --> 55:30.416
And you'll be helping a great cause.

55:31.250 --> 55:33.333
Actors are all about that, right?

55:34.416 --> 55:37.750
Yeah. But what if she asks
about something that isn't in the notes?

55:37.833 --> 55:39.208
You improvise.

55:40.416 --> 55:43.000
Look, as an actor,
this is right in your wheelhouse.

55:43.083 --> 55:46.958
Don't stress about it.
It's just two dates, and then it's over.

55:47.791 --> 55:49.500
So? What's your fee?

55:50.250 --> 55:52.458
Jesus. Man, I hate coconut balls.

55:54.166 --> 55:57.083
It's very important
that you like coconut balls.

55:57.166 --> 55:59.791
Well, it's gonna cost you.

56:02.041 --> 56:03.958
My favorite's the second one.

56:04.041 --> 56:07.958
Well, my favorite's the last one.
I know most people prefer The Two Towers,

56:08.041 --> 56:11.083
but I just watched them,
like, 20 times, so I'm very sure.

56:11.166 --> 56:13.500
And you didn't used to give a crap
about Tolkien?

56:13.583 --> 56:16.166
My tastes have completely changed.
It's crazy.

56:16.250 --> 56:17.375
Since when?

56:18.916 --> 56:21.416
I don't know. Like two months ago.

56:21.500 --> 56:22.500
The salts.

56:22.583 --> 56:25.500
And all of a sudden,
I couldn't get your name out of my head.

56:25.583 --> 56:28.250
"Jime Herrera…"
So, I knew I had to find you.

56:28.333 --> 56:30.375
You must think I'm nuts, right?

56:31.458 --> 56:32.458
Not at all.

56:34.333 --> 56:36.125
What happened to your arm?

56:36.625 --> 56:41.583
Yeah, that. I had this real urge
to hop on a skateboard.

56:41.666 --> 56:45.125
So I bought one and then… triple fracture.
What bad luck, huh?

56:45.916 --> 56:47.500
Can I ask you something?

56:48.000 --> 56:48.875
Sure.

56:48.958 --> 56:51.291
Name a band, a city, a type of cheese,

56:51.375 --> 56:53.916
an animal you hate,
and an episode of The Simpsons.

56:54.708 --> 56:56.166
Wow. Okay.

56:57.416 --> 56:59.833
Let's see. Band? Slipknot.

57:01.625 --> 57:04.333
Edinburgh. Emmentaler.

57:05.333 --> 57:08.166
-The episode with Pinchy.
-A great one!

57:08.250 --> 57:11.291
And… Oh, and rodents. I fucking hate them.

57:21.750 --> 57:23.000
Where've you been hiding?

57:31.291 --> 57:35.791
I FOUND HIM. HE'S SANTI!

57:38.375 --> 57:39.250
Maca.

57:42.750 --> 57:43.583
Maca.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.250
I just wanted to apologize.

57:52.875 --> 57:55.250
For what happened the other day
in my office, and…

57:57.083 --> 57:58.208
for everything.

57:59.583 --> 58:02.000
I left without giving you an explanation.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.208
I was so wrong.

58:04.958 --> 58:05.791
So wrong.

58:06.291 --> 58:10.416
And I'm so sorry because I swear
I never meant to hurt you.

58:17.583 --> 58:19.833
You seemed pretty confident
in your decisions.

58:22.583 --> 58:24.375
No. It was really hard for me

58:24.875 --> 58:28.541
to live my life without you
by my side, bugging me 24/7.

58:31.375 --> 58:32.625
I'm so sorry.

58:35.833 --> 58:37.250
I truly am.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.375
Friends?

58:57.083 --> 58:58.000
Fine.

59:12.916 --> 59:14.166
What are you doing here?

59:15.208 --> 59:16.833
Complicating things for myself.

59:26.500 --> 59:28.750
I made part of the guest list,

59:28.833 --> 59:31.291
and, of course, Raquel had to be invited.

59:31.375 --> 59:35.333
I added a plus-one for her.
But I'm praying she doesn't bring Leo.

59:35.416 --> 59:39.083
Even though he's pretending to be
an adult now, I don't want to see him.

59:40.958 --> 59:41.833
Maca!

59:47.583 --> 59:49.708
Call Mateo. My ponytail's coming undone.

59:49.791 --> 59:51.166
-Want me to fix it?
-No.

59:51.250 --> 59:52.916
-Call Mateo.
-Okay. On it.

59:57.083 --> 59:58.833
Mateo…

59:58.916 --> 59:59.916
Maca!

1:00:00.916 --> 1:00:03.291
-Hey.
-Is this purse yours?

1:00:03.375 --> 1:00:05.500
Pipa gave it to me. It's from Milan.

1:00:05.583 --> 1:00:08.750
She felt bad about the ceremony,
and sometimes she's nice.

1:00:09.458 --> 1:00:12.000
Babe, they gave her
this purse in a showroom.

1:00:12.083 --> 1:00:14.875
She didn't want it
because too many hands had touched it.

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:15.958
What?

1:00:17.625 --> 1:00:20.625
I could cry from all this stress.

1:00:20.708 --> 1:00:22.583
Don't cry. It's all right.

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:29.333
Raquel, I'm really sorry for what I said
the other day about Leo.

1:00:30.541 --> 1:00:31.791
It's fine.

1:00:32.291 --> 1:00:35.166
Actually, we're working on
communicating better,

1:00:35.250 --> 1:00:36.666
and it's going well.

1:00:36.750 --> 1:00:39.708
-I'm glad.
-Why don't we all get dinner sometime?

1:00:39.791 --> 1:00:42.958
-No.
-Yeah. It'll be like a new beginning.

1:00:44.958 --> 1:00:46.916
Time to pretend to be an adult.

1:00:48.625 --> 1:00:50.541
-Sure.
-Bring whoever you want.

1:00:51.916 --> 1:00:53.291
I'll let my boyfriend know.

1:00:54.375 --> 1:00:57.125
Anyway, I gotta call Mateo,
Pipa's hairstylist.

1:00:57.208 --> 1:00:58.416
I'll see you later.

1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:00.208
-Okay. See you.
-Bye for now.

1:01:05.875 --> 1:01:08.083
You can't spend your life
running away from him.

1:01:08.166 --> 1:01:10.916
He apologized, you chilled out,
you haven't lost your focus.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:12.583
You can be friends.

1:01:12.666 --> 1:01:14.500
Friends? Are you kidding me?

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.333
Now I've heard it all.

1:01:18.541 --> 1:01:20.833
We're gonna be friends with Leo now?

1:01:20.916 --> 1:01:24.125
CRAPPY DECISION

1:01:30.625 --> 1:01:33.875
-You can really throw 'em back, huh?
-Many years of practice.

1:01:33.958 --> 1:01:35.166
I can see that.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.041
WHY WON'T U RESPOND? ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:43.916
Hey, could we go see
an exhibition this Friday?

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.041
There's one at the Reina Sofía
I've been dying to see.

1:01:47.125 --> 1:01:48.250
It's about to close.

1:01:49.166 --> 1:01:53.500
Yeah, I'm not sure.
I was thinking about coming back here.

1:01:53.583 --> 1:01:55.375
-To the skate park?
-Yeah.

1:01:55.458 --> 1:01:58.291
But neither of us can even get on a board.

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:02.416
Yeah, but I like being here,
hanging out with the guys.

1:02:02.500 --> 1:02:04.083
Santi loved it here.

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:07.541
And I was planning
to score some weed and get a nice high.

1:02:08.041 --> 1:02:10.333
I don't smoke joints like I used to.

1:02:21.666 --> 1:02:22.500
Maca.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.041
What are you wearing?

1:02:30.041 --> 1:02:32.791
Remember, we love each other, we're happy,

1:02:32.875 --> 1:02:36.750
we're moving in together,
and you're extremely intelligent.

1:02:36.833 --> 1:02:37.666
Got it.

1:02:38.625 --> 1:02:42.291
We're looking for something
around La Latina or Barrio de Letras.

1:02:42.375 --> 1:02:44.083
I love those areas.

1:02:44.166 --> 1:02:47.500
But we were thinking about
moving out of the city, right?

1:02:47.583 --> 1:02:49.041
-Yeah.
-To the country?

1:02:49.125 --> 1:02:52.208
But Leo puts on bug spray
anytime he goes past the M-30.

1:02:53.208 --> 1:02:56.625
Then it's about time
he gets in touch with nature.

1:02:56.708 --> 1:02:59.250
-Reconnect with Pachamama.
-Pachamama.

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:03.458
The truth is, the air quality
in the city has been awful lately.

1:03:03.541 --> 1:03:05.958
But if you're going to live in La Latina…

1:03:06.041 --> 1:03:07.041
Thank you.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.291
Whatever my baby wants.

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:19.708
Coque, what is it you do, exactly?
Aside from getting very nice tattoos.

1:03:19.791 --> 1:03:23.916
Thanks. Well, I do a bit of everything.
I DJ. I do podcasts, stand-up…

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.125
-Stand-up?
-Yeah.

1:03:25.208 --> 1:03:27.416
Rent prices must've gone down
in the city, huh?

1:03:28.375 --> 1:03:29.833
And what's your stand-up about?

1:03:29.916 --> 1:03:33.291
-How are the urban gardens doing?
-Wait, don't tell me.

1:03:33.375 --> 1:03:36.500
-Millennial sexcapades?
-You've seen my stuff!

1:03:37.291 --> 1:03:39.041
It's cool you do so many things, Coque.

1:03:39.625 --> 1:03:42.833
And they say there are no entrepreneurs
in this country. A toast.

1:03:42.916 --> 1:03:44.250
You sound like an old man.

1:03:45.333 --> 1:03:47.083
I kind of am one. In spirit.

1:03:47.166 --> 1:03:51.083
Yeah. How old were you when you started
wearing a robe around the house? Ten?

1:03:51.166 --> 1:03:54.541
That's a bit much. That's really too much.

1:03:55.041 --> 1:03:57.958
-I bet you still wear it.
-Know what's too much?

1:03:58.041 --> 1:04:02.375
Nobody knows where that robe went.
It mysteriously disappeared.

1:04:03.791 --> 1:04:05.583
You can fess up to it. It's been years.

1:04:05.666 --> 1:04:06.666
-No.
-Where is it?

1:04:06.750 --> 1:04:09.666
I don't know.
It must've wound up in the same place as…

1:04:10.833 --> 1:04:11.833
As what?

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:14.416
The same place…

1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:16.875
-Yeah.
-I totally forgot about it! For real?

1:04:16.958 --> 1:04:18.791
-No, not there.
-In the same place?

1:04:18.875 --> 1:04:20.916
Yeah.

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:22.666
-No.
-Yes.

1:04:22.750 --> 1:04:24.916
Do you know why I thought that?

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.708
Remember that time
your mom brought us lasagna?

1:04:28.791 --> 1:04:32.375
We're really interested
in urban gardens, Raquel.

1:04:32.458 --> 1:04:35.708
Because we want an apartment
with a balcony.

1:04:35.791 --> 1:04:37.458
That's important. A balcony.

1:04:40.916 --> 1:04:42.333
I don't know.

1:04:42.916 --> 1:04:46.083
-He's not how I imagined.
-You can't judge a book by its cover.

1:04:46.166 --> 1:04:48.208
-Right.
-Raquel really liked him.

1:04:48.291 --> 1:04:50.625
That's because Raquel
is great with everyone.

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:54.541
-You're really moving in together?
-Why wouldn't we be?

1:04:54.625 --> 1:04:58.958
I don't know, Maca.
I just can't picture you two together.

1:05:00.208 --> 1:05:01.666
And who can you picture me with?

1:05:04.916 --> 1:05:07.791
How interesting. Well, let us know.

1:05:07.875 --> 1:05:09.041
Hey.

1:05:09.541 --> 1:05:11.416
-Should we get going?
-Yeah.

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:14.000
-Let's do this again sometime.
-Yeah.

1:05:14.083 --> 1:05:15.125
-Soon?
-Soon.

1:05:15.208 --> 1:05:16.458
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:05:17.208 --> 1:05:18.625
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:05:19.291 --> 1:05:21.833
-That went awesome, huh?
-How about a drink?

1:05:27.208 --> 1:05:31.458
Hey, Adri. Are you free for lunch?
I don't know what to do. I mean…

1:05:31.541 --> 1:05:35.208
I need to talk,
and you're the group's voice of reason.

1:05:35.291 --> 1:05:38.083
I'll drop by your shop
at noon, okay?

1:06:02.291 --> 1:06:03.166
You cutie.

1:06:09.750 --> 1:06:10.833
Maca!

1:06:14.666 --> 1:06:15.916
You look amazing.

1:06:16.625 --> 1:06:19.166
Before you leave,
organize my bags too, okay?

1:06:19.250 --> 1:06:20.583
I gotta go. I have plans.

1:06:20.666 --> 1:06:22.833
If you hurry,
you'll finish before eight today.

1:06:23.708 --> 1:06:26.166
-Okay. Have a good time.
-Thanks, sweetie.

1:06:32.458 --> 1:06:37.708
MACA, I'M PASSING YOUR CV AROUND.
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:45.958
Hi.

1:06:47.541 --> 1:06:50.916
-How did you know where I work?
-I asked around.

1:06:52.375 --> 1:06:53.541
Wow.

1:06:53.625 --> 1:06:54.875
Sorry.

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:58.000
He can't stop with the apologies lately.

1:06:58.875 --> 1:07:00.166
It suits him.

1:07:00.916 --> 1:07:03.833
-Let me take you to dinner.
-Is Raquel joining us?

1:07:04.541 --> 1:07:06.333
As in, "I want her to come."

1:07:06.416 --> 1:07:09.666
No. The thing is,
I'm writing a research paper

1:07:09.750 --> 1:07:15.166
on love in contemporary literature,
and… I'd really like to hear your opinion.

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:18.541
Something quick.

1:07:18.625 --> 1:07:20.416
-Not a sit-down thing, okay?
-All right.

1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:28.458
I like it overall, but… I don't know.
It's missing something.

1:07:28.541 --> 1:07:29.458
Something like?

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:32.958
It needs to be more emotionally involved.

1:07:33.458 --> 1:07:37.833
It's just theory. You analyze
these stories, but it's detached.

1:07:37.916 --> 1:07:40.125
I see. So?

1:07:41.375 --> 1:07:45.125
Take a look around you,
not just at the pages in a book.

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:47.083
Around me?

1:07:48.166 --> 1:07:50.791
Yeah. At the people who are close to you.

1:07:51.291 --> 1:07:53.958
Your memories. Your experiences.

1:07:55.458 --> 1:07:59.333
You know reflecting on my own life
isn't my strong suit.

1:08:02.083 --> 1:08:03.375
Are you hungry?

1:08:04.208 --> 1:08:06.125
She isn't texting me back either.

1:08:07.125 --> 1:08:09.375
Pipa must have her slaving away again.

1:08:09.875 --> 1:08:12.958
-Definitely.
-So, how are you doing?

1:08:14.291 --> 1:08:15.416
Just great.

1:08:16.208 --> 1:08:18.125
Well, great

1:08:18.625 --> 1:08:21.750
or more than great.
Or more than, more than great.

1:08:21.833 --> 1:08:22.833
Really?

1:08:22.916 --> 1:08:24.958
Well, Santi Part Two is…

1:08:26.666 --> 1:08:29.125
I don't know. I can't even explain it.

1:08:29.791 --> 1:08:32.208
Oh, but… You're still seeing him?

1:08:32.291 --> 1:08:37.125
Of course. I spent years looking for him.
Now I gotta face the consequences.

1:08:41.333 --> 1:08:45.958
JORGE, YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN UP WITH HER YET?

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:49.833
WHY?

1:08:49.916 --> 1:08:52.041
I LOVE HER!

1:08:52.541 --> 1:08:55.125
He's my man. Just like Julián's yours.

1:09:01.250 --> 1:09:02.875
-Jime…
-What?

1:09:06.291 --> 1:09:09.208
I get a 50% discount on wedding dresses.

1:09:10.708 --> 1:09:12.250
-Interested?
-Great plan!

1:09:12.333 --> 1:09:15.041
-Right?
-And in three months, a huge wedding!

1:09:15.125 --> 1:09:17.000
Come on. Let's get going.

1:09:18.083 --> 1:09:19.208
Crap.

1:09:25.458 --> 1:09:27.250
-It's weird.
-What is?

1:09:28.041 --> 1:09:30.500
You're the same guy,
but you're so different.

1:09:30.583 --> 1:09:31.708
How?

1:09:33.708 --> 1:09:35.958
I guess you seem more grown-up.

1:09:37.750 --> 1:09:40.916
I get the feeling
things would be different now.

1:09:43.375 --> 1:09:45.541
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not suggesting anything.

1:09:45.625 --> 1:09:46.833
No, of course not.

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:53.041
It's just, Raquel looks so happy,
and you look so at peace,

1:09:53.125 --> 1:09:55.541
and our relationship
was so different from that.

1:09:56.750 --> 1:09:59.833
Maca, we were very happy too.

1:10:01.041 --> 1:10:03.000
What we had was really special.

1:10:04.083 --> 1:10:07.166
Maybe I'm just talking for myself here,
but I have great memories.

1:10:07.250 --> 1:10:08.291
Sure.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:16.083
I need you to think about what we had
as a great period in our lives, Maca.

1:10:16.166 --> 1:10:20.166
It's true we had our share
of hard times too, but it was great.

1:10:21.083 --> 1:10:23.625
And it helped us become who we are today.

1:10:24.625 --> 1:10:26.250
I don't know who I am.

1:10:28.625 --> 1:10:30.625
You're an amazing woman.

1:10:32.208 --> 1:10:33.833
And a robe thief.

1:10:34.541 --> 1:10:35.791
You're stubborn.

1:10:37.083 --> 1:10:39.583
You're capable of inciting a student riot.

1:10:41.666 --> 1:10:44.125
You're someone with dazzling eyes.

1:10:47.541 --> 1:10:49.416
But most of all, you're stubborn.

1:11:17.750 --> 1:11:18.875
Check out this house.

1:11:18.958 --> 1:11:22.666
A water recycling system,
a vegetable garden, solar panels.

1:11:23.166 --> 1:11:24.458
I love it.

1:11:30.333 --> 1:11:32.708
Jime, I need to tell you something.

1:11:32.791 --> 1:11:34.708
It's a message from Santi.

1:11:37.458 --> 1:11:39.500
Jime, I'm getting something.

1:11:39.583 --> 1:11:41.750
-From Santi?
-Yeah.

1:11:43.458 --> 1:11:44.916
I'm getting that…

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.583
you're amazing
and I really like spending time with you.

1:11:52.458 --> 1:11:54.833
I mean, we get each other, right?

1:11:54.916 --> 1:11:56.958
-We laugh together.
-Yeah.

1:11:57.458 --> 1:12:00.958
Santi and I connected the most
over our sense of humor.

1:12:01.041 --> 1:12:03.916
-I'm funny too, right?
-Yeah.

1:12:09.208 --> 1:12:10.333
Check this out.

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.541
"For it shows things that were,
and things that are,

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:16.833
things that yet may be.
But which it is that he sees…"

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:19.291
"Even the wisest cannot always tell."

1:12:19.375 --> 1:12:21.291
-The Lord of the Rings?
-Yeah.

1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:34.291
-I'm really happy with you.
-So am I.

1:12:37.041 --> 1:12:40.000
-But you can't keep doing this, Adri.
-I know.

1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.583
I think about it every day.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000
I know.

1:12:56.583 --> 1:12:57.791
I gotta go.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:06.833
Hey.

1:13:07.541 --> 1:13:08.500
Hey.

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:11.333
It's not your fault.

1:13:12.208 --> 1:13:14.416
What I had with Raquel
wasn't going anywhere.

1:13:15.833 --> 1:13:17.458
It's not your fault, but

1:13:18.791 --> 1:13:21.791
since I saw you, I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

1:13:24.375 --> 1:13:26.125
If this were a rom-com,

1:13:26.208 --> 1:13:29.000
a torrential downpour
would start right about now.

1:13:33.708 --> 1:13:37.500
Maca, I'm sorry. This wasn't my plan.

1:13:37.583 --> 1:13:39.750
I know you still resent me
and I deserve it…

1:13:39.833 --> 1:13:41.708
because I've been an idiot.

1:13:42.875 --> 1:13:45.750
If you'd been the one to leave,
I would've been crushed.

1:13:46.916 --> 1:13:48.833
You're right. I'm a dick.

1:13:49.583 --> 1:13:52.000
I'm a conceited jerk
who ruins someone's life

1:13:52.083 --> 1:13:54.333
and doesn't even have the balls
to apologize.

1:13:54.416 --> 1:13:57.875
And, I'll admit,
it hurts to see you with somebody else

1:13:58.375 --> 1:13:59.500
because I love you.

1:14:00.166 --> 1:14:01.083
I love you.

1:14:02.541 --> 1:14:08.291
Okay, now if this really were a rom-com,
I would've leaped into his arms.

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.750
I exist only when you look at me.

1:14:11.833 --> 1:14:13.791
-Don't say that.
-It's the truth.

1:14:13.875 --> 1:14:15.875
Even when I'm not looking,
you exist.

1:14:16.375 --> 1:14:19.750
See? You're still exist, right?

1:18:57.958 --> 1:18:58.791
Hey.

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.041
Want… milk?

1:19:08.166 --> 1:19:09.000
Sure.

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.833
-Is this coffee?
-No.

1:19:12.750 --> 1:19:14.416
-Milk?
-Just milk.

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:15.791
Just milk? Okay.

1:19:15.875 --> 1:19:18.125
This is… Okay. All right.

1:19:18.625 --> 1:19:21.166
-Here, in the Clarín one?
-Whichever one you want.

1:19:21.250 --> 1:19:22.625
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1:19:26.125 --> 1:19:27.750
Your clothespin looks nice.

1:19:31.708 --> 1:19:34.000
Welcome to Pipa's world.

1:19:34.083 --> 1:19:37.291
So, we finally get
to see the beast's lair.

1:19:40.416 --> 1:19:42.833
-This is where you work, Maca?
-Yeah.

1:19:45.125 --> 1:19:47.333
This is unbelievable.

1:19:49.208 --> 1:19:52.791
-You're sure she's not gonna show up?
-Yeah. She's in Ibiza this weekend.

1:19:52.875 --> 1:19:56.000
-I can't believe this!
-It'd be cool if she never came back.

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:59.625
-Remember, she's the one who pays me.
-Yeah, I know.

1:19:59.708 --> 1:20:03.541
At her age, I still lived with my folks
and had no plans to move out.

1:20:03.625 --> 1:20:05.833
-Hi, girls.
-Hi.

1:20:07.916 --> 1:20:09.291
What's this?

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:13.500
-For fanning your ego?
-Oh, please do. Just a bit.

1:20:14.333 --> 1:20:16.875
Careful. It'd take Maca
six months to pay that off.

1:20:17.375 --> 1:20:19.000
This is insane.

1:20:23.333 --> 1:20:27.875
Hey, how are you? I'm a millionaire,
and I get paid for posting on Instagram.

1:20:29.541 --> 1:20:32.333
Adri, do I look like her?

1:20:34.875 --> 1:20:39.291
-Not bad. Give me a bit more vanity.
-Yeah, I also need that tribal look.

1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:44.000
And here's the best part.

1:20:45.166 --> 1:20:49.083
-Help yourselves, ladies.
-Wait. We can try on anything we want?

1:20:49.166 --> 1:20:50.666
-Yeah.
-That's crazy.

1:20:50.750 --> 1:20:54.958
Take whatever you like from this pile.
They're gifts she hasn't opened.

1:20:55.041 --> 1:20:55.916
I'm gonna cry.

1:20:56.541 --> 1:20:59.125
-Oh là là, comment ça va ?
-Mon chéri.

1:21:00.375 --> 1:21:05.000
Maca. Oh, Maca, don't eat, okay? Maca.

1:21:05.083 --> 1:21:07.083
Maca, don't breathe.

1:21:07.875 --> 1:21:10.708
I don't get why I haven't reached
ten million followers yet.

1:21:10.791 --> 1:21:12.833
It's all your fault, Maca.

1:21:14.875 --> 1:21:18.000
Sweetie, you know
I want you to wear heels.

1:21:18.083 --> 1:21:19.875
It looks better.

1:21:24.583 --> 1:21:25.416
Goodbye.

1:22:07.916 --> 1:22:09.000
Here's to us.

1:22:09.083 --> 1:22:11.250
And to getting wasted tonight.

1:22:12.916 --> 1:22:13.750
Cheers.

1:22:13.833 --> 1:22:17.958
Wow, Adri. You are smoking hot
in that dress. I can't believe it.

1:22:18.041 --> 1:22:19.125
-Totally.
-Yeah?

1:22:19.208 --> 1:22:20.041
Keep it.

1:22:20.541 --> 1:22:22.291
-What?
-For real. It's yours.

1:22:22.375 --> 1:22:23.583
Seriously?

1:22:24.333 --> 1:22:27.416
I'll only be able
to squeeze into it for so long…

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:29.708
Don't start with those insecurities now.

1:22:29.791 --> 1:22:32.708
Girls, there's something
I have to tell you.

1:22:33.958 --> 1:22:37.375
You already know that…
well, that my life needed a change.

1:22:38.208 --> 1:22:41.208
Listen, Adri,
what matters most is accepting it.

1:22:41.291 --> 1:22:44.208
Don't worry,
we won't have any issues with it.

1:22:44.291 --> 1:22:45.291
What's up?

1:22:46.208 --> 1:22:48.916
Julián and I have decided
to take the next step.

1:22:51.416 --> 1:22:55.083
We're gonna try for a baby.
We want a baby!

1:22:55.583 --> 1:22:58.541
-I'm gonna be an aunt?
-Maybe even a godmother.

1:22:58.625 --> 1:22:59.708
What? Oh my God!

1:23:01.791 --> 1:23:04.125
Well, we've got to celebrate, right?

1:23:04.208 --> 1:23:07.208
For sure. Somewhere
that's as great as this news is.

1:23:07.291 --> 1:23:09.500
-Yes, please.
-I know this awesome rooftop bar.

1:23:09.583 --> 1:23:11.791
-Let's go.
-It has a pool. You'll love it.

1:23:13.041 --> 1:23:16.000
Hey. Head downstairs,
and I'll catch up with you.

1:23:16.083 --> 1:23:17.166
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:23:19.666 --> 1:23:20.625
Hello?

1:23:20.708 --> 1:23:22.666
Bonsoir. Macarena Bartual?

1:23:22.750 --> 1:23:25.791
-Yes, this is Macarena.
-I'm calling from Good Mode Magazine.

1:23:25.875 --> 1:23:28.375
I'm Clément Dubois, the magazine's editor.

1:23:28.458 --> 1:23:30.375
Yes? Hello, good evening.

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:33.208
-I assume you've heard of Good Mode.
-Yes.

1:23:33.291 --> 1:23:36.750
Raquel sent us your CV
and a glowing recommendation.

1:23:36.833 --> 1:23:39.583
I must say, we really like your profile.

1:23:39.666 --> 1:23:40.500
That's great.

1:23:40.583 --> 1:23:44.583
We need someone to manage
the magazine's new media strategy,

1:23:44.666 --> 1:23:48.458
someone with experience in social media,
and we thought of you.

1:23:48.541 --> 1:23:53.208
-Would you be interested?
-Thank you so much. You won't regret it.

1:23:53.291 --> 1:23:56.041
I'll give it my all.

1:23:56.125 --> 1:23:59.000
You'd be joining
our communications department.

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:03.000
But the position's based
in our Paris headquarters, not in Madrid.

1:24:03.083 --> 1:24:06.875
-Have you ever been to Paris?
-Paris? Yes.

1:24:07.791 --> 1:24:09.416
I love you a lot.

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:15.333
I love Paris. The Eiffel Tower,
pain au chocolat, croissants.

1:24:15.416 --> 1:24:18.000
Super. We'd need you to start right away.

1:24:18.083 --> 1:24:20.625
If you could give us an answer
in two weeks…

1:24:20.708 --> 1:24:23.125
Two weeks. Oui.

1:24:23.208 --> 1:24:26.333
Or earlier if you want.
Merci beaucoup, Macarena.

1:24:26.416 --> 1:24:28.666
-Merci, au revoir.
-Merci, au revoir.

1:25:26.500 --> 1:25:30.041
I love you guys so much.
We'll always be together, right?

1:25:30.125 --> 1:25:32.666
-Always.
-Always.

1:25:36.333 --> 1:25:38.291
Damn, you guys are the best.

1:25:43.208 --> 1:25:44.291
I love Leo.

1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.250
I love Leo!

1:25:47.333 --> 1:25:49.791
I love him.

1:25:49.875 --> 1:25:53.833
When I'm with him, it's like…

1:25:53.916 --> 1:25:57.000
It's hard to put into words.

1:25:57.083 --> 1:25:59.208
My head just explodes.

1:25:59.291 --> 1:26:01.041
My heart too.

1:26:01.750 --> 1:26:04.500
I think she's traveling back in time.

1:26:04.583 --> 1:26:07.750
Maca, what year are you in?

1:26:07.833 --> 1:26:11.791
Do they still have MP3 players?
Do cell phones have keyboards?

1:26:11.875 --> 1:26:13.875
What do you got there, Snake?

1:26:17.041 --> 1:26:19.541
-What?
-Maca, did you see him again?

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.708
After what he did to you?

1:26:22.791 --> 1:26:26.041
Didn't you lock him in the plane bathroom?
What happened? He escaped?

1:26:26.125 --> 1:26:29.666
I didn't want to.
Well, no, I did. He smells so good.

1:26:29.750 --> 1:26:32.666
But I haven't forgotten
what he did to me. No.

1:26:32.750 --> 1:26:35.791
Maca, look.
Weren't you trying to become empowered?

1:26:35.875 --> 1:26:37.375
What the hell do I know?

1:26:37.458 --> 1:26:39.041
-All right, that's it.
-No.

1:26:39.125 --> 1:26:41.166
-I'm changing the song.
-Adriana.

1:26:41.250 --> 1:26:42.541
Adriana!

1:26:42.625 --> 1:26:45.750
Hey. He left you a total wreck.
He's your kryptonite.

1:26:45.833 --> 1:26:46.666
Maca!

1:26:46.750 --> 1:26:49.416
You ditched us for him.
We talked about this.

1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:52.916
I get it now.
That's why you let Pipa walk all over you.

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.250
Because when he shows up,
you don't give a damn about anything else.

1:26:56.333 --> 1:26:59.291
You need to stop this. Now. Right now.

1:26:59.375 --> 1:27:02.000
I know what's good for me,
and I do the opposite. So what?

1:27:02.083 --> 1:27:04.625
Just like how you're hung up
on the threesome girl,

1:27:04.708 --> 1:27:08.333
and you still want a kid with Julián,
who you haven't cared about in years.

1:27:08.416 --> 1:27:10.708
You fell for the girl from the threesome?

1:27:12.041 --> 1:27:12.916
I saw you together.

1:27:16.166 --> 1:27:19.625
-Fuck you.
-I saw you. I'd never seen you that happy.

1:27:19.708 --> 1:27:23.000
You were beaming.
And now you're having a kid with Julián?

1:27:23.083 --> 1:27:25.291
I don't know if things
will work out with Julia.

1:27:25.375 --> 1:27:27.208
It's not that simple, you know?

1:27:27.750 --> 1:27:31.791
Are you really going to settle
out of fear of being alone? Take a risk!

1:27:32.458 --> 1:27:36.625
Says the one hiding behind
her first boyfriend to avoid moving on.

1:27:40.083 --> 1:27:42.708
Okay, anything else
to confess, you vipers?

1:27:42.791 --> 1:27:44.583
Yeah. Santi's dead!

1:28:01.333 --> 1:28:02.166
That's right.

1:28:03.125 --> 1:28:05.416
We all have our kryptonite.

1:28:05.875 --> 1:28:08.958
And it seems easier
to keep it locked away than to face it.

1:28:10.458 --> 1:28:14.541
That night, the three of us decided
to run from our uncomfortable truths

1:28:14.625 --> 1:28:16.708
by seeking shelter at home.

1:28:22.833 --> 1:28:24.541
How'd it go with the girls?

1:28:25.833 --> 1:28:26.750
Good.

1:28:31.666 --> 1:28:33.208
We have to do it today, right?

1:28:34.708 --> 1:28:37.458
Wake me up early,
and we'll have a quickie.

1:28:44.208 --> 1:28:49.291
Hey. What's wrong?
You scared me when you said it was urgent.

1:28:50.541 --> 1:28:51.500
Are you okay?

1:28:57.500 --> 1:28:58.750
Wanna get married?

1:29:25.916 --> 1:29:27.125
Bonjour. Clément?

1:29:28.875 --> 1:29:31.875
Yes, but I still have
three days to decide, right?

1:29:32.375 --> 1:29:36.666
Okay. I'll let you know on Monday.
I'm still wrapping up a few things.

1:29:37.166 --> 1:29:38.333
Yes.

1:29:38.416 --> 1:29:40.041
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

1:29:53.166 --> 1:29:57.083
After all, I'm not that bad off here.
Check this place out.

1:29:57.166 --> 1:30:00.083
Maca!

1:30:00.166 --> 1:30:04.583
Where did you put my eggplant belt?
Oh, why can't I ever find anything?

1:30:05.083 --> 1:30:06.291
Coming!

1:30:15.791 --> 1:30:18.125
I got a job offer.

1:30:18.208 --> 1:30:21.208
It's a position at a really good magazine.

1:30:21.708 --> 1:30:22.958
Really?

1:30:23.041 --> 1:30:24.541
It's a great opportunity.

1:30:25.375 --> 1:30:27.291
You're so talented, Macarena.

1:30:27.375 --> 1:30:29.791
-Yeah, but--
-The Pipa thing's a dead end.

1:30:30.291 --> 1:30:32.041
But the thing is…

1:30:32.125 --> 1:30:33.958
I am so proud of you.

1:30:40.083 --> 1:30:41.208
I love you.

1:30:42.250 --> 1:30:43.500
I love you too.

1:30:51.666 --> 1:30:53.791
I want to be

1:30:54.541 --> 1:30:56.833
Whatever I want to be

1:30:57.333 --> 1:30:59.333
I love myself

1:31:00.625 --> 1:31:04.291
I love myself

1:31:04.875 --> 1:31:08.000
I want to see you free
I want to see you strong

1:31:08.083 --> 1:31:12.416
I want to see you whole

1:31:19.333 --> 1:31:23.916
Whole

1:31:27.958 --> 1:31:30.791
And if we lost each other

1:31:31.416 --> 1:31:34.958
We'll meet again

1:31:39.791 --> 1:31:41.125
Far away

1:31:41.208 --> 1:31:44.500
And if we meet

1:31:44.583 --> 1:31:48.541
We'll have the clarity to see

1:31:49.583 --> 1:31:52.166
What's coming our way

1:31:52.250 --> 1:31:59.208
Accept and comprehend
That everything can end

1:31:59.291 --> 1:32:01.416
Whole

1:32:08.375 --> 1:32:11.375
Whole

1:32:12.375 --> 1:32:13.208
Hi.

1:32:13.708 --> 1:32:17.458
Hi, babe.
I got you folic acid. It's in the kitchen.

1:32:17.541 --> 1:32:21.250
I asked about paternity leave at work,
and it won't be an issue.

1:32:21.333 --> 1:32:24.500
You'll see. We've got this.

1:32:29.208 --> 1:32:30.041
What's wrong?

1:32:31.500 --> 1:32:32.416
Jime.

1:32:33.250 --> 1:32:38.041
We're moving really fast, and I have
something important to tell you.

1:32:38.833 --> 1:32:41.583
How about we see if this can work
without the spirit thing?

1:32:42.166 --> 1:32:43.125
What?

1:32:45.916 --> 1:32:47.375
I'm not Santi.

1:32:48.583 --> 1:32:52.541
Your friends hired me to pretend
to be him and say goodbye to you.

1:32:52.625 --> 1:32:54.500
So you'd finally be free.

1:32:54.583 --> 1:32:56.625
But then I started
having feelings for you.

1:32:56.708 --> 1:32:59.083
I'm sorry. I didn't want to lie to you.

1:32:59.166 --> 1:33:01.541
I'm an idiot. That's it. I said it.

1:33:01.625 --> 1:33:03.875
And they told you what he liked?

1:33:04.916 --> 1:33:06.666
What bitches, right?

1:33:06.750 --> 1:33:09.250
I fucking hate coconut balls and elves.

1:33:09.916 --> 1:33:10.916
I do too.

1:33:14.125 --> 1:33:15.208
I swear.

1:33:15.833 --> 1:33:17.500
And this is a fake cast.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:20.625
I can't wait to take this shit off.

1:33:20.708 --> 1:33:22.666
Damn. So, you're an actor?

1:33:22.750 --> 1:33:24.166
Yeah, that part's true.

1:33:27.416 --> 1:33:28.333
Hey.

1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:30.875
I really like you.

1:33:31.375 --> 1:33:33.875
Do you still wanna get married?

1:33:35.666 --> 1:33:39.708
I really like you too,
but I think we're better off as friends.

1:33:39.791 --> 1:33:42.208
It's just… Look, I need to go.

1:33:42.291 --> 1:33:45.666
But if you want to be friends,
I'm all for that, okay?

1:33:46.875 --> 1:33:49.041
I don't know. Call me if you want,

1:33:49.125 --> 1:33:52.250
and I'll get back to you,
and we'll be in touch.

1:33:53.458 --> 1:33:55.375
I dunno. We'll see what happens.

1:33:57.583 --> 1:34:00.916
I have to take care of
something really important. Sor--

1:34:02.291 --> 1:34:03.208
I'm okay!

1:34:05.083 --> 1:34:06.166
Bye!

1:34:09.916 --> 1:34:11.958
Jimena, Samuel's seeing a patient.

1:34:25.125 --> 1:34:27.083
It's okay, Victoria. Relax.

1:34:34.916 --> 1:34:37.875
Relax. It's nothing.
Want me to put on some music?

1:34:47.583 --> 1:34:50.375
DRINKS?

1:35:32.250 --> 1:35:36.208
Two more steps forward and step up.
Perfect. There you go.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.916
There. Hold on. I'll close the door.

1:35:42.291 --> 1:35:43.708
Now, straight ahead.

1:35:46.375 --> 1:35:47.666
There. Great.

1:35:49.208 --> 1:35:51.750
Wait. Now turn to the right a bit.

1:35:53.708 --> 1:35:55.291
A little further.

1:35:55.791 --> 1:35:57.041
A little more.

1:35:57.541 --> 1:35:58.500
Here.

1:35:58.583 --> 1:36:00.458
-Ready?
-Yeah.

1:36:13.791 --> 1:36:15.250
It looks the same.

1:36:19.541 --> 1:36:21.875
But… what're we doing here?

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.125
Remember this?

1:36:30.458 --> 1:36:35.041
-The photo from my pool membership card.
-You got it taken on our second date.

1:36:35.125 --> 1:36:37.250
-Remember?
-Yeah.

1:36:37.750 --> 1:36:39.375
I've kept it with me.

1:36:40.916 --> 1:36:43.291
Because I never stopped loving you, Maca.

1:36:44.416 --> 1:36:46.208
And this time, I'm not letting you go.

1:36:47.041 --> 1:36:48.541
I know you so well…

1:36:50.958 --> 1:36:53.500
but at the same time,
it's like we just met.

1:36:54.541 --> 1:36:55.500
Maca…

1:36:58.458 --> 1:37:00.958
I want us to live here together.

1:37:02.958 --> 1:37:05.208
I want to wake up beside you every day.

1:37:07.666 --> 1:37:08.750
And I want…

1:37:10.291 --> 1:37:13.375
to eat breakfast with you
on this balcony every morning.

1:37:17.541 --> 1:37:20.333
We'll eat breakfast
on that balcony every morning.

1:37:23.541 --> 1:37:27.541
-Look at all this natural light.
-It's so nice. I love it.

1:37:29.666 --> 1:37:32.041
Oh, and we can use this room as a study.

1:37:32.625 --> 1:37:37.291
Money might be a little tight at first,
but it'll be worth it, won't it?

1:37:38.416 --> 1:37:41.958
-Should we do it, then?
-You'd applied for a scholarship.

1:37:42.041 --> 1:37:45.416
You were afraid to commit.
You know it. What're you doing?

1:37:45.500 --> 1:37:48.166
-I'm gonna tell them we'll take it.
-Okay.

1:37:49.458 --> 1:37:50.666
What are you doing?

1:37:51.875 --> 1:37:53.875
I can't stand you.

1:37:55.250 --> 1:37:57.916
Well, your past self
doesn't seem so upset.

1:37:59.875 --> 1:38:01.041
Why, Leo?

1:38:01.958 --> 1:38:04.250
Why don't you say it
when I get off that call?

1:38:05.875 --> 1:38:08.041
Why don't you tell me
about the scholarship?

1:38:08.125 --> 1:38:10.291
We could've gone there together.

1:38:11.750 --> 1:38:14.583
If I go, it doesn't mean
I'm not madly in love with you.

1:38:14.666 --> 1:38:17.458
I'm asking why
you can't be honest with me.

1:38:23.333 --> 1:38:24.458
Because I'm afraid.

1:38:25.583 --> 1:38:28.541
-Afraid of what?
-I don't know. Of losing it all.

1:38:33.791 --> 1:38:36.041
You think I'll get the scholarship?

1:38:44.333 --> 1:38:46.250
You needed to go by yourself.

1:38:47.708 --> 1:38:48.833
That's why.

1:38:50.166 --> 1:38:52.666
That's what you couldn't say to my face.

1:38:57.625 --> 1:38:59.250
Now I get it, Leo.

1:39:02.166 --> 1:39:04.208
She wasn't able to understand, but I am.

1:39:05.166 --> 1:39:07.833
We're the couple
who's looking at the apartment.

1:39:08.333 --> 1:39:10.208
-Tell her.
-It's great.

1:39:12.041 --> 1:39:13.791
Can't you see how excited she is?

1:39:13.875 --> 1:39:15.666
We love the apartment, and…

1:39:15.750 --> 1:39:18.041
You're going to break her heart.

1:39:21.583 --> 1:39:22.708
Okay. Tomorrow…

1:39:22.791 --> 1:39:23.666
Tell her.

1:39:23.750 --> 1:39:25.833
…we'll get the information to you…

1:39:25.916 --> 1:39:28.166
Thanks so much. That's so nice of you.

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.375
I'm so happy.

1:39:57.708 --> 1:40:00.458
I got a job offer in Paris,
and I'm gonna take it.

1:40:01.625 --> 1:40:02.666
In Paris?

1:40:05.791 --> 1:40:07.833
You could come with me if you want.

1:40:14.291 --> 1:40:17.166
And what about my classes?

1:40:17.958 --> 1:40:19.583
I know, I understand.

1:40:23.708 --> 1:40:24.708
Maca…

1:40:26.583 --> 1:40:29.000
is this because of Boston?

1:40:30.583 --> 1:40:31.750
No, Leo.

1:40:33.875 --> 1:40:36.458
For the first time,
it has nothing to do with you.

1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:50.000
Something's changing in me

1:40:51.583 --> 1:40:53.958
Growing

1:40:56.041 --> 1:40:58.541
Something's changing in you

1:41:00.333 --> 1:41:02.916
It's showing

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.916
I'm gonna find a light to make it bright

1:41:08.416 --> 1:41:10.625
All of these moments

1:41:13.375 --> 1:41:16.583
Leaving behind what I need to leave

1:41:17.375 --> 1:41:19.125
And continue growing

1:41:29.250 --> 1:41:33.083
You're doing a wonderful job, Luigi.
It's amazing. It's fantastic.

1:41:33.583 --> 1:41:36.833
Macarena, I didn't call you.
What are you doing here?

1:41:36.916 --> 1:41:38.291
-I'm going.
-Where?

1:41:38.375 --> 1:41:40.666
Working for you has been literal hell.

1:41:41.250 --> 1:41:44.000
You couldn't be
more cold-hearted or obnoxious.

1:41:44.083 --> 1:41:48.083
And you know what, sweetie?
You're never going to be anyone's icon.

1:41:48.166 --> 1:41:49.708
Macarena, stop.

1:41:50.208 --> 1:41:51.416
What is she doing?

1:41:55.708 --> 1:41:56.541
Cheers.

1:41:57.541 --> 1:41:58.458
You're fired.

1:41:58.541 --> 1:41:59.875
Thanks!

1:42:00.375 --> 1:42:02.958
I'm walking, consciousness, freedom

1:42:03.708 --> 1:42:08.166
I'm walking awake…

1:42:18.791 --> 1:42:19.666
Hey.

1:42:20.416 --> 1:42:22.833
I tried you both,
but neither of you picked up.

1:42:22.916 --> 1:42:24.583
Well, I know you called me before

1:42:24.666 --> 1:42:27.458
and I was the one who didn't answer,
so we're all assholes.

1:42:28.583 --> 1:42:34.875
I just… wanted to let you know
that I'm moving to Paris.

1:42:35.375 --> 1:42:36.500
For real.

1:42:37.708 --> 1:42:40.958
I got a job at a great magazine.

1:42:41.625 --> 1:42:44.583
And… I ended things with Leo.

1:42:45.625 --> 1:42:50.083
It was going well, but…
I can't think about him right now.

1:42:50.166 --> 1:42:51.833
Though I am thinking about you two.

1:42:51.916 --> 1:42:55.875
I couldn't care less if you want
to have kids or if you're necrophiliacs.

1:42:55.958 --> 1:42:57.166
I love you anyway.

1:42:57.875 --> 1:43:00.375
So, I hope you're proud of me.

1:43:00.875 --> 1:43:03.958
I made it.
I'm where I always wanted to be.

1:43:04.541 --> 1:43:08.750
And I wish… you the same,
whatever it is that you want.

1:43:19.166 --> 1:43:20.083
Hi.

1:43:21.291 --> 1:43:22.458
Come in.

1:43:22.541 --> 1:43:27.583
Remember that we're more than
the choices we make, right or wrong,

1:43:28.416 --> 1:43:30.583
and that we made it this far together.

1:43:32.125 --> 1:43:35.333
I hope I can learn to be on my own.
It doesn't scare me anymore.

1:43:36.083 --> 1:43:37.958
But I know it's gonna be hard.

1:43:38.958 --> 1:43:41.375
I know that I can call you
when I'm feeling down

1:43:41.458 --> 1:43:43.041
and that you'll visit, and…

1:43:43.875 --> 1:43:45.291
I love you so much.

1:43:47.500 --> 1:43:49.500
I miss you already.

1:44:04.208 --> 1:44:05.041
Hello.

1:44:06.583 --> 1:44:07.708
Good morning.

1:44:14.750 --> 1:44:17.791
I really feel like myself here,

1:44:18.333 --> 1:44:22.041
the way I want to be,
without caring what people think,

1:44:22.125 --> 1:44:23.958
and I'm proud of myself.

1:44:26.791 --> 1:44:29.833
WE MISS YOU!

1:44:29.916 --> 1:44:32.666
-A selfie for my Spanish friends?
-Sure.

1:44:36.791 --> 1:44:38.083
Nice.

1:44:39.041 --> 1:44:40.250
I love it.

1:44:45.625 --> 1:44:49.750
My life was missing a lot of things
when I got that job offer.

1:44:49.833 --> 1:44:53.375
But now I've embraced my past,
my present, and my future.

1:44:55.666 --> 1:44:58.125
Now I know love doesn't have to hurt.

1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:04.041
Now I know that you need to learn
to love yourself first.

1:45:05.833 --> 1:45:08.791
And only when you do that
can you really be ready to love…

1:45:10.583 --> 1:45:12.583
and share your life with someone else.

1:45:17.833 --> 1:45:18.875
Wait a minute.

1:45:18.958 --> 1:45:23.375
If this were a rom-com,
then this is how it would end.
