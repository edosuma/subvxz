02:11.340 --> 02:13.383
(Driver) Are you Japanese?

02:15.010 --> 02:18.805
Want me to introduce you
to some good-looking babes?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.978
Asshole doesn't even speak English.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.650
(Bellboy) ls, er...
Is this all right, sir?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.952
Thank you, sir.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.088
(Whistles)

03:39.178 --> 03:41.221
(Silent)

04:04.995 --> 04:06.663
Are you going out, sir?

04:08.332 --> 04:12.127
Oh, please don't bother, sir.
You already gave me a tip.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.981
(Bellboy) Please take
the gentleman to this address.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.149
(Driver) Got it.

04:51.250 --> 04:55.003
He worked here a while ago,
but he got into some trouble,

04:55.087 --> 04:57.130
so I fired him.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.340
(Breaking glass)

06:21.423 --> 06:24.968
Damn! Where the fuck
are your eyes, motherfucker?

06:25.010 --> 06:28.805
Huh? What you gonna do
about my wine, motherfucker?

06:28.889 --> 06:32.518
Ain't some old cheap-ass wine.
Gonna cost you $200!

06:32.643 --> 06:36.522
Huh, yeah...huh? Huh?

06:39.274 --> 06:40.526
Shit!

06:41.777 --> 06:44.196
(Groans)

07:59.438 --> 08:01.982
(Phone)

09:34.741 --> 09:36.451
Tobacco.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.563
Hey, who the hell are you?

22:58.295 --> 22:59.838
This is my big brother.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.798
- Hey, whassup?
- Whassup?

23:01.882 --> 23:05.594
(Brother) Where's Denny?
How come he's not here yet?

23:05.677 --> 23:08.222
(Jay) Must be gambling again.

23:08.305 --> 23:11.183
(Brother) Let's go
without him, then.

23:17.940 --> 23:21.193
(Mo) Check it.
(Brother) OK, let's go.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.604
You doing all right?

23:57.688 --> 23:59.731
(lndistinct chatter)

24:07.489 --> 24:10.200
That's how I have
to hit 'em sometimes.

24:10.284 --> 24:12.452
I can feel 'em!

24:12.536 --> 24:14.913
One, two, three, four, let's go!

24:18.834 --> 24:21.879
(Jay) 'You're brothers,
but you don't look alike.'

24:21.962 --> 24:26.717
Yeah. We are half-brothers.
I don't knowthe details.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.344
We were all abandoned.

24:29.428 --> 24:31.430
Isn't that right, my brother?

24:37.686 --> 24:40.981
We were all put in, er,
some funny institution.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.193
My brother paid for me
to come here and study.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.236
And you end up pushing drugs.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.947
Don't say that
in front of my brother.

24:49.031 --> 24:52.075
But he doesn't
understand English anyway.

24:58.207 --> 25:00.375
Is there anything you need, sir?

25:00.459 --> 25:03.712
Do you have water?
I'll get you some right away.

25:03.795 --> 25:07.090
And what time will you be
leaving tomorrow, sir?

25:25.901 --> 25:28.403
Damn! No tip this time!

25:45.963 --> 25:48.590
He gave the maid 100 bucks
to make his bed.

25:48.674 --> 25:50.467
He must be really loaded.

25:50.551 --> 25:55.097
Then the maid left him
$95 change and this note saying,

25:55.180 --> 25:59.852
"You shouldn't spend money
like this. $5 is enough."

26:01.061 --> 26:03.063
If it were me, I'd have kept it.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.773
(Mo) Hell, yeah!

26:11.530 --> 26:13.907
Hey, Denny. What happened?

26:13.991 --> 26:15.701
(Sighs and groans)

26:17.077 --> 26:19.580
Some joker cut me up yesterday, man.

26:19.663 --> 26:22.624
- Who?
- Fuck if I know.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.252
Chink. Some Jap motherfucker, man.

26:25.335 --> 26:28.463
Must've been trying to gank
another tourist.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.132
You don't give up, do you?

26:30.215 --> 26:34.344
Denny, this is my big brother.
He's here from Japan.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.814
Your brother didn't run into me
yesterday, did he?

26:45.898 --> 26:48.859
He's not the one
who fucked my eye up, is he?

26:48.942 --> 26:50.569
What?

26:58.785 --> 27:01.163
All Japanese look the same to you.

27:01.246 --> 27:03.624
You can't tell one from the other.

27:06.168 --> 27:09.630
- Maybe so.
- Well, shall we go?

27:09.713 --> 27:13.759
Yo. Y'all gotta roll without me, man.
man. This shit is hurting.

27:13.842 --> 27:16.637
Then you can hang out
with my brother.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.764
But he doesn't speak English.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.725
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with him?

27:21.808 --> 27:23.936
Drink beer and kill time.

27:24.019 --> 27:26.063
OK, Aniki.

27:26.146 --> 27:29.066
How much beer
are we supposed to drink?

27:37.950 --> 27:39.993
(Silent)

28:17.447 --> 28:19.533
Let's play.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.544
(Traffiic, sirens in distance)

28:39.052 --> 28:41.180
(Denny) 'All right, check it out.'

28:41.263 --> 28:44.558
I'm betting you
six to one odds, all right?

28:44.641 --> 28:47.436
So if I win,
that's six times, all right?

28:47.519 --> 28:50.981
If I bet $10 I get 60 back, OK?

28:51.064 --> 28:53.108
Roll the dice.

28:54.276 --> 28:57.362
Um, ah, let me think...three.

28:57.446 --> 29:00.908
Three. It's gonna be a three.
I know it in my heart.

29:05.787 --> 29:09.500
- Six.
- Oh, you betting, too?

29:09.625 --> 29:12.961
All right. Well, ifyou win
you get $60, you know?.

29:13.045 --> 29:15.088
Let's see who's gonna...

29:15.172 --> 29:17.883
(Chuckling) Ain't that a bitch?

29:17.966 --> 29:20.594
All right,
let's do it one more time.

29:20.677 --> 29:24.723
This time I got two and four
at three to one odds, all right?

29:24.765 --> 29:28.018
So if I get one ofthem,
that's three times, OK?

29:28.101 --> 29:31.313
All right?
Let's see what you got now, player.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.814
Come on. Come on.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.986
What? What?

29:39.780 --> 29:41.323
Six.

29:41.406 --> 29:45.452
No, no! Ain't nobody
gonna get six twice in a row!

29:45.536 --> 29:48.455
You crazy, man, or what?
Well, what is it?

29:50.999 --> 29:53.335
Ain't that a...

29:53.418 --> 29:56.046
Something wrong
with these dice, man!

29:56.129 --> 29:59.216
You're cheating.
Something. God damn!

30:01.009 --> 30:03.053
$20, man...

30:11.228 --> 30:13.021
Hey, where you going, man?

30:13.105 --> 30:15.190
Ah, ta-ba-ko.

30:15.274 --> 30:19.528
Ta..ta-ba-ko. What?

30:19.611 --> 30:21.238
Cigarette.

30:21.321 --> 30:26.785
Oh, tobacco! There's a store
right out there. Check it out.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.203
(Door closes)

30:28.287 --> 30:30.956
Cheatin'-ass mother...

30:31.081 --> 30:33.584
What the hell?

30:33.667 --> 30:37.504
Oh, now, ain't this a bitch?
Oh, yeah.

30:37.588 --> 30:40.591
A fucking hole in the cup?

30:40.674 --> 30:42.551
Son of a bitch!

30:44.428 --> 30:46.221
A hole in the cup!

30:46.346 --> 30:49.183
It's the oldest trick
in the book, man!

30:53.520 --> 30:55.856
I can't believe this shit.

31:00.319 --> 31:03.363
Hand over the money
for the last batch.

31:03.447 --> 31:05.282
All right.

31:16.627 --> 31:18.086
What the fuck is this?

31:18.170 --> 31:21.840
- Fifteen hundred, right?
- No, three Gs.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.383
Hey, that's too much.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.219
That's the price.

31:25.302 --> 31:27.095
We can't make money, then.

31:27.179 --> 31:30.015
Take it or leave it.
I didn't make you sell drugs.

31:30.098 --> 31:33.477
- What are we supposed to do?
- Shut the fuck up!

32:19.606 --> 32:22.609
All right, you cheating son
of a bitch, where's my money?

33:00.272 --> 33:04.276
Mo, get my brother
back to the hotel...please.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.403
- All right.
- Be careful!

33:16.246 --> 33:18.040
What the fuck is going on?

33:18.123 --> 33:20.709
Ken's brother
beat the shit out ofVictor.

33:20.792 --> 33:24.004
(Laughing) That's tight!

33:26.673 --> 33:30.302
Are you the Jap
that beat up the boss, hmm?

33:30.385 --> 33:32.471
Come with us. Come on.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.014
(Mo) Yo, hold up, man.

33:34.097 --> 33:36.975
You don't follow him.
We'll kill you.

33:41.855 --> 33:44.191
Hold up. Then why'd he hit Ken?

34:04.086 --> 34:05.295
(Falls on horn)

34:08.841 --> 34:10.842
(Horn continues)

34:14.679 --> 34:16.723
(Horn stops)

34:19.141 --> 34:21.186
(Car door opening)

34:29.527 --> 34:30.987
(Quiet samba music)

35:02.936 --> 35:05.480
What the fuck do you want,
cabron, huh?

35:24.708 --> 35:26.668
(Speaks Japanese)

35:26.752 --> 35:30.255
Ifyou kill him in one shot,
he'll give you 10 bucks.

35:54.154 --> 35:58.075
My brother says we are
going to war with the cholos.

36:26.812 --> 36:28.981
(Knock at door)

37:05.017 --> 37:08.353
(Jay) What exactly
did he do in Japan?

37:08.437 --> 37:10.522
(Ken) He was a gangster.

37:11.648 --> 37:13.942
(Mo) Who's the other guy?

37:14.026 --> 37:16.111
(Ken) His lieutenant.

37:16.195 --> 37:18.238
(Conversation inaudible)

39:11.894 --> 39:13.937
Where we gonna hide these?

39:15.439 --> 39:17.774
Take 'em out ofthe bag.

39:24.698 --> 39:26.742
- Will it fit?
- Yeah.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.955
Wait a minute.

39:42.466 --> 39:44.510
OK.

40:20.671 --> 40:23.590
So do you think you'd
get away with what you did?

40:30.681 --> 40:33.308
What are you gonna do?
Go to war with us?

40:33.392 --> 40:34.852
We'd wipe you out!

40:40.065 --> 40:41.817
Bring it on. Come on!

40:41.900 --> 40:43.360
(Laughs)

40:43.443 --> 40:45.904
Just relax. We're kidding.

40:45.988 --> 40:49.449
Let's discuss this
like gentlemen, yeah?

40:49.533 --> 40:52.035
We'll give you the territory.

40:52.077 --> 40:54.496
We didn't like those guys anyway.

40:54.580 --> 40:59.585
From now on, you're gonna be
in charge, just as it always was.

40:59.668 --> 41:02.796
You don't have any
objection to that, right?

41:08.135 --> 41:10.179
OK, we accept.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.860
(Door closes)

41:27.237 --> 41:30.532
You told them you'd let them
have the territory.

41:30.616 --> 41:33.202
Why do that for these fucking Japs?

41:33.285 --> 41:35.871
Why not?

41:35.996 --> 41:39.124
We're gonna massacre 'em
all later anyway.

44:02.893 --> 44:05.270
Where did Aniki say we were going?

44:05.354 --> 44:07.564
He said he's meeting some woman.

44:42.432 --> 44:44.268
I'm sorry I'm late.

44:44.393 --> 44:47.312
Hi, guys. I'm Marina.
Nice to meet you.

45:00.492 --> 45:02.536
He's justjoking.

45:18.427 --> 45:20.679
(Ken) 'Hey, where's Denny?'

45:20.762 --> 45:23.974
(Mo) 'lt's his mom's birthday,
he's at home.'

45:24.057 --> 45:26.768
(Ken) 'Doesn't his mom
work any more?'

45:26.852 --> 45:29.897
(Jay) 'She don't need
to be a maid any more.'

45:29.980 --> 45:31.690
(Ken) 'Right, right.'

45:31.773 --> 45:33.817
(Chatter)

45:41.992 --> 45:45.913
- Hey. Thanks for coming by.
- No problem, man. Free food!

45:47.748 --> 45:49.791
Hey, Ma, these are my friends.

45:51.710 --> 45:54.379
- Hello.
- Happy birthday, Mrs Turner.

45:54.463 --> 45:56.548
This is for you, from my brother.

45:56.632 --> 45:59.301
Oh, from your brother? Thank you.

46:01.470 --> 46:05.224
Ah, he's not my brother.
He's not here.

46:05.307 --> 46:07.684
Oh, OK, all right.

46:07.768 --> 46:11.355
Listen, would you guys help
yourselfto cake, please?

46:11.438 --> 46:12.648
OK.

46:12.731 --> 46:15.275
Go on. There's a lot
for everybody. Go on.

46:16.819 --> 46:20.781
(Giggling) Oh, look at this!
This couldn't fit me.

46:20.864 --> 46:22.366
- For Latifah.
- Is it?

46:22.449 --> 46:24.326
- Come on. Come here.
- For me?

46:24.409 --> 46:26.787
Yes. Oh, Latifah.
Oh, my goodness.

46:26.870 --> 46:28.664
You know howto put this on?

46:31.792 --> 46:34.586
That... That...

46:34.670 --> 46:39.216
That bitch took Aniki, took Aniki.

46:41.718 --> 46:45.013
Oh, this is nice.
I knowwhen I'm gonna use this!

46:45.097 --> 46:47.975
Your friends
have such wonderful taste!

46:48.058 --> 46:52.938
There. Let's try this one.
Oh, boy.

46:55.357 --> 46:58.527
OK, OK, how do we get this off?
Ah, here we go.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.158
Ah, this is interesting.
What's in this?

47:11.707 --> 47:13.750
(Woman) Put 'em on!

47:13.834 --> 47:18.130
They knowwhat to get you, don't
they? Don't they? Look at that.

47:18.213 --> 47:19.923
Oh, man.

47:20.007 --> 47:22.467
Now, don't try to be too cool.

50:41.625 --> 50:43.210
Uh-huh.

50:43.293 --> 50:45.170
Come on, relax.

50:47.923 --> 50:50.759
- Ooh.
- Hey, Jay.

50:50.843 --> 50:53.512
I'm Michael Jordan.

50:53.595 --> 50:55.639
- What?
- I'm Michael Jordan.

50:55.722 --> 50:58.308
No, you're more like Michael Gordon.

50:58.392 --> 51:01.311
Not Michael Jordan,
don't get it twisted.

51:01.395 --> 51:04.731
- Michael Gordon, that's you.
- I'm Michael Jordan.

51:04.815 --> 51:07.693
You knowwhat I mean?
You knowwhat I mean?

51:07.776 --> 51:11.321
Y'all got Michael Jordan?
Not our Michael Jordan.

51:11.405 --> 51:13.448
- I'm Michael Jordan.
- Oh, OK.

51:13.532 --> 51:17.578
- The same Michael Jordan.
- Not the bald-headed Mike.

51:19.705 --> 51:23.125
No, you're like
Shaquille O'Neal right there.

51:23.208 --> 51:24.793
That's who you're like.

51:26.378 --> 51:29.673
- Shaq, you're like Shaq.
- I'm Michael Jordan.

51:33.677 --> 51:35.846
Man. Man.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.267
Er...woman.

51:44.688 --> 51:46.106
Man.

51:52.946 --> 51:54.573
Man.

51:58.702 --> 52:00.204
Man.

52:03.207 --> 52:06.460
Man, even if
I raise my handicap to 20...

52:06.543 --> 52:09.838
How much more could I win
in an hour? It's crazy.

52:13.217 --> 52:15.928
- Woman.
- Damn.

52:20.015 --> 52:22.059
Woman.

52:26.355 --> 52:28.398
Woman.

52:28.482 --> 52:30.317
(Chuckling)

52:31.652 --> 52:33.570
Woman.

52:36.698 --> 52:40.494
The same woman is going
back and forth down the street.

52:40.577 --> 52:42.788
What's going on?

53:10.482 --> 53:12.526
That's Aniki's woman.

53:20.659 --> 53:22.369
(Money counter whirrs)

53:29.251 --> 53:31.086
Ken, would you sign this?

53:31.170 --> 53:33.589
All right.

53:33.672 --> 53:36.466
- Sign, please.
- OK.

53:44.516 --> 53:46.977
You're spending too much.

53:50.731 --> 53:53.692
What are you doing?
Hurry up, do some work!

54:02.451 --> 54:05.412
That was my piece
until a little while ago.

54:05.496 --> 54:07.998
Well, once we take it, it's ours.

54:08.081 --> 54:11.084
Oh, I get it. Kinda like you.

54:30.270 --> 54:31.605
Hey, how's it going?

54:31.688 --> 54:34.191
That ho hasn't called yet, sir.

54:34.274 --> 54:37.486
- How many hos do you have?
- Five, sir.

54:37.569 --> 54:39.321
Business is slow, huh?

54:47.204 --> 54:49.248
Nice fucking shirt!

54:58.048 --> 55:01.593
Japs and niggers! Big fucking deal!

55:39.131 --> 55:41.466
Hey, wanna play some dice?

55:41.550 --> 55:44.011
- Hmm, OK.
- All right. No cheating.

55:44.094 --> 55:45.512
(Laughing) OK.

55:45.596 --> 55:48.891
All right, I'm gonna
call my mother real quick.

55:53.687 --> 55:55.731
(Helicopter overhead)

56:01.653 --> 56:04.823
Hey, what's up, Ma? Yeah, it's me.

56:04.907 --> 56:06.867
I'm gonna be late, all right?

56:06.950 --> 56:10.913
Got some things I gotta do.
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.261
Aniki?

56:31.016 --> 56:33.560
(Man) Drop the gun or I'll kill him.

56:36.605 --> 56:40.108
- (Man) Drop the gun!
- Put the fucking gun down!

56:40.234 --> 56:43.153
(Man) I'll kill him!
(Aniki) Shoot! Shoot!

56:43.278 --> 56:44.613
Put the gun down!

56:44.696 --> 56:46.824
(Man) Drop it!
(Aniki) Shoot!

56:53.956 --> 56:55.999
Oh, shit.

57:07.678 --> 57:09.721
Aniki!

57:32.369 --> 57:33.912
He needs rest.

57:33.996 --> 57:38.750
All right.
Sorry, doc. Hope this is OK.

57:38.834 --> 57:40.460
Thanks.

58:07.488 --> 58:09.323
(Gunshots)

58:29.343 --> 58:31.386
Keep your eyes open.

58:35.390 --> 58:38.519
Don't you think it's time
for your brother to move?

58:38.602 --> 58:40.896
He likes it here.

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:17.159
How is he?

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:20.537
Much better.
He was fooling around with Denny.

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:27.169
We caught the pusher who ran away.

01:00:34.968 --> 01:00:37.304
What are you doing? Stand up!

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:45.020
Hey! Go to the sushi bar.
Get knife and cutting board.

01:00:46.897 --> 01:00:48.690
What are you guys gonna do?

01:00:48.774 --> 01:00:50.818
Cut his finger off.

01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:53.612
What happens ifyou
cut his finger off?

01:00:53.654 --> 01:00:57.658
Erm...he can't
swim straight any more.

01:01:04.706 --> 01:01:08.126
How's that?
You can't feel anything, can you?

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.462
(Fast, nervous breathing)

01:01:10.546 --> 01:01:12.047
Do it.

01:01:15.884 --> 01:01:17.344
Do it.

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.347
Do it!

01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:30.649
Wait, wait!
I'll give it back, all right?

01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:33.610
Just stop the shit.
Don't cut my fucking...

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:35.154
(Screaming) Oh, God!

01:01:35.237 --> 01:01:38.198
Get off me!

01:01:38.282 --> 01:01:41.952
Oh, shit! You mother-FUCK!

01:02:05.225 --> 01:02:07.144
- Hey, Mo.
- Yeah?

01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:09.354
Who's the boss of Little Tokyo?

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:11.857
Some, ah, player named Shirase.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.318
- Shirase?
- Shirase.

01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:18.405
Should I tell Aniki
ifwe got together,

01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:22.951
Iike join up with them,
our family will be bigger?

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:25.370
What do you think?

01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:36.215
Joining forces with Shirase
is a bad idea.

01:02:36.298 --> 01:02:40.010
- Why?
- He's way too dangerous.

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:46.016
So are we.

01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:12.584
Hey, Aniki, want me to
get you some cigarettes?

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:14.378
No, thanks.

01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:18.841
- Why?
- My stomach...hurts.

01:03:18.924 --> 01:03:22.928
(Sighing) I'm sorry, man.

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:25.222
Justjoking. Joking.

01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:30.269
You're messing with me, man.

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:44.032
(Ken) You wait here.

01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:45.719
Hey. These fucking guys
want me to be a henchman, you know?.

01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.306
What should I tell them?

01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:19.308
Hey, stop!

01:09:37.719 --> 01:09:39.095
(Tyres screech)

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:11.563
The boss says we don't need you.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:16.151
What is this bullshit? You need me!

01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:19.780
You wanna fucking expand,
you need me. I'm the man!

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:23.534
You know how many I killed?
I got a long list of bodies!

01:11:23.617 --> 01:11:27.204
Fucking Japs cross me,
you'll be on that long list...

01:11:27.287 --> 01:11:29.206
(Gunshot)

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.465
You! Come upstairs.

01:11:55.649 --> 01:11:59.903
- You did it this time, boy.
- How's your friend feel?

01:12:03.115 --> 01:12:06.326
You want some, come and get some

01:12:07.953 --> 01:12:10.080
Where you from? (Laughing)

01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:19.548
Take care, now.

01:13:11.767 --> 01:13:14.436
He's in a bad mood. What happened?

01:16:37.598 --> 01:16:39.641
(Groaning)

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:25.080
(Man) 'We got your woman.

01:18:25.164 --> 01:18:28.375
'Come to the Sixth Street bridge.
Come alone.'

01:18:57.196 --> 01:18:59.114
Shouldn't you take him home?

01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:03.619
He doesn't want me to know
where he lives.

01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:06.914
(Shirase) Ah...
That's playing it safe, huh?

01:19:17.216 --> 01:19:19.510
(Groans)

01:19:45.744 --> 01:19:47.120
Isn't Aniki coming?

01:19:47.204 --> 01:19:50.624
No, he's got something
to take care of.

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:52.084
Shit!

01:19:52.209 --> 01:19:53.627
You know,

01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:57.714
he should pay more attention
to the family business.

01:20:18.986 --> 01:20:20.571
What shall we do?

01:20:22.197 --> 01:20:24.324
It's war.

01:20:24.408 --> 01:20:28.120
Fuck with the ltalians,
we'll be asking for trouble.

01:20:28.203 --> 01:20:29.746
(Mo) We'll all die.

01:20:29.872 --> 01:20:32.749
I'm a Yakuza from the old school.

01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:37.337
If I have to die, so be it.

01:20:37.421 --> 01:20:39.506
(Man) Freeze!

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:56.523
- Bring him over here.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:03.822
Who sent you?

01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:06.617
Which family?

01:21:27.429 --> 01:21:29.097
(Screams)

01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:04.883
Aniki?

01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:09.388
You OK?

01:22:13.517 --> 01:22:16.270
You don't look too good, man.
Gonna eat?

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.153
Denny... Run away.

01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:26.780
What?

01:22:26.864 --> 01:22:28.907
Where to?

01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:32.369
Hm. Here, eat it.

01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:38.041
Really?

01:22:39.251 --> 01:22:40.961
All right.

01:23:17.956 --> 01:23:21.084
Hey, boys. Here's to the boss.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:23.754
Hey, to Don, congratulations.

01:23:27.466 --> 01:23:28.926
That's not bad, is it?

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:31.220
(Chatter and laughter)

01:23:55.202 --> 01:23:56.745
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:24:00.499 --> 01:24:02.584
(Gasping and choking)

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:28.443
(Shirase) We just killed
Geppetti, so it's war.

01:24:29.862 --> 01:24:31.530
You better be ready.

01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:34.366
The Mafia will torture you to death.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.955
Ifyou get caught,
take one ofthese.

01:24:41.415 --> 01:24:44.626
You'll die quickly without pain.

01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:51.341
Aniki.

01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:54.261
You and l,
we don't need this shit, right?

01:25:46.396 --> 01:25:48.816
What a terrible thing to do.

01:25:51.026 --> 01:25:53.487
- Clean it up.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:10.045 --> 01:26:11.672
(Jay clears throat)

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:34.903
(Explosion)

01:26:50.752 --> 01:26:52.588
Aniki.

01:27:18.363 --> 01:27:21.200
We are going to avenge
Aniki's death.

01:27:21.283 --> 01:27:23.494
Don't even think about running.

01:27:48.101 --> 01:27:49.895
(Man) Denny, gimme my 9mm!

01:27:49.978 --> 01:27:53.982
OK, buddy, let's go. Colin. Colin!

01:27:54.066 --> 01:27:55.734
So, he's dead.

01:27:55.859 --> 01:27:57.569
(Shouting and gunfire)

01:28:00.823 --> 01:28:03.116
(Heavy gunfire)

01:28:32.354 --> 01:28:34.398
(Shouting)

01:28:42.072 --> 01:28:44.283
(Screaming and gunfire)

01:29:51.183 --> 01:29:53.143
- What is it?
- Some clothes.

01:29:53.227 --> 01:29:55.854
Let's go
to my mother's house for now.

01:29:55.896 --> 01:29:57.773
OK. Go.

01:30:35.978 --> 01:30:37.980
Wait here.

01:30:50.117 --> 01:30:51.702
Ma!

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:54.955
Ma!

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.666
(Denny) Oh, God... Oh, God.

01:30:59.042 --> 01:31:01.628
Oh, God... Oh, God.

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:37.623
Oh, God. Oh, God. (Sobbing)

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.839
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:31:50.469 --> 01:31:52.554
(Door buzzer)

01:32:10.155 --> 01:32:11.406
Jay, run!

01:32:13.867 --> 01:32:15.410
(Gunshots)

01:34:15.322 --> 01:34:18.200
There's only one of 'em.

01:34:19.451 --> 01:34:21.286
Let's go.

01:34:22.996 --> 01:34:26.750
Aniki, you don't have
to do this, you know?.

01:34:26.875 --> 01:34:28.919
This is my business.

01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:25.225
Denny, OK, go ahead.

01:35:28.145 --> 01:35:31.565
Ahh! Ahh! Oh, God!

01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:34.985
(Denny) Oh! Oh, God!

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:37.863
Oh! Oh, God have mercy!

01:35:37.946 --> 01:35:39.573
(Denny groaning)

01:35:42.618 --> 01:35:44.661
(Guard) Hey, it's all right.

01:36:36.922 --> 01:36:39.133
So what do you wanna do with him?

01:37:38.066 --> 01:37:41.278
All right, here's how it works.

01:37:41.403 --> 01:37:45.449
Now, one ofthese five strings
is attached to the trigger.

01:37:45.532 --> 01:37:47.159
You get to choose three.

01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:48.911
If none of 'em pull...

01:37:51.121 --> 01:37:53.999
we'll let you go, honestly.

01:37:54.082 --> 01:37:57.127
All right?
Now go ahead, choose three.

01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:02.800
(Denny) Come on.

01:38:04.009 --> 01:38:06.553
Come on!

01:38:06.637 --> 01:38:08.597
Pick one!

01:38:10.307 --> 01:38:12.684
The first one. On the left!

01:38:12.768 --> 01:38:14.728
This one? All right.

01:38:18.774 --> 01:38:21.068
All right. Choose another one.

01:38:24.696 --> 01:38:26.532
Come on!

01:38:26.615 --> 01:38:30.994
(Sighing) Ah...fifth one.

01:38:31.078 --> 01:38:34.540
Fifth? One, two,
three, four, five...

01:38:40.212 --> 01:38:43.590
Pretty lucky guy!
All right, last one.

01:38:55.394 --> 01:38:56.854
Come on, come on!

01:38:56.937 --> 01:38:59.982
- The second one.
- Second.

01:39:06.864 --> 01:39:10.492
God damn son of a bitch!
You motherfuckers!

01:39:50.866 --> 01:39:53.619
Get out. Get out!

01:39:58.332 --> 01:40:01.752
- Come on. Come on!
- What are you doing?

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.087
(Gunshots)

01:40:49.883 --> 01:40:53.804
Here. Take it. Run away.

01:41:04.857 --> 01:41:07.317
Denny, your eye...

01:41:09.403 --> 01:41:11.572
I did it.

01:41:16.285 --> 01:41:18.662
Yeah, I know, my brother.

01:41:39.516 --> 01:41:42.060
You even killed
one ofyour own men.

01:41:44.354 --> 01:41:46.773
You evil son of a bitch, you.

01:43:00.973 --> 01:43:02.558
(Phone)

01:43:04.977 --> 01:43:07.020
(Ringing continues)

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:16.864
(Ringing stops)

01:43:36.133 --> 01:43:40.512
You Japanese are so inscrutable.

Fucking run away?

01:46:27.596 --> 01:46:31.099
Where the fuck am I supposed
to run to, huh? Run where?
