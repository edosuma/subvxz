He thinks the world of me.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.665
Guangdong, bang a gong.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.369
I-- I prepared a folder
and everything.

17:50.369 --> 17:51.703
Look, I know
how you feel.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.305
Sure, it hurts now,
but over time,

17:53.305 --> 17:55.974
you'll learn to turn that pain
into biting sarcasm,

17:55.974 --> 17:58.510
which you'll use
to hurt others.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.879
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.
All right, thanks.

18:00.879 --> 18:05.217
I-- I can't help but thinking,
What about me didn't he like?

18:05.217 --> 18:06.352
What did I do wrong?

18:06.352 --> 18:09.888
That's exactly what
I asked Jodie Foster.

18:10.889 --> 18:14.226
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

18:18.930 --> 18:20.299
Hey, you remember
that DVD

18:20.299 --> 18:22.268
those idiots claimed
we never sent back?

18:22.268 --> 18:27.339
And then we raised hell and got
that customer service guy fired?

18:27.873 --> 18:29.575
You better not tell me
you found it.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.210
Don't try to spin this
into bad news.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.780
We own Nacho Libre
free and clear.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.382
[KNOCK AT DOOR]

18:36.748 --> 18:38.284
Hey guys. Is it okay
if I take a shower?

18:38.284 --> 18:41.153
I thought you were going to--
Sure, yeah. Go ahead.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.888
[COUGHS]
Chicken.

18:43.589 --> 18:44.590
And good news.

18:44.590 --> 18:48.227
The sink came in early, and
it's being installed tomorrow.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.729
And since you guys
have been so great...

18:50.729 --> 18:52.898
Oh, you didn't
have to do that.

18:52.898 --> 18:56.067
Oh, my favorite:
alcohol.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.936
It's a 2003
Saint-Exupéry.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.538
Oh, this is really
expensive.

18:59.538 --> 19:00.706
Oh, it's the least
we can do

19:00.706 --> 19:02.308
for how great you guys
have been to us.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.210
I just hope we weren't
an imposition.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.844
No. No,
not at all.

19:05.844 --> 19:09.114
So nice to know
we have such good friends.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.517
Hey, look, you lost
your nerve,

19:11.517 --> 19:13.485
but we got a nice bottle
of wine out of the deal.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.388
So maybe you were right
in not saying anything.

19:16.388 --> 19:17.223
Yeah.

19:17.223 --> 19:20.226
I-- I didn't say
anything.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.760
Meaning what?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.962
Meaning ...I might
have left

19:23.962 --> 19:25.731
a little message
on the mirror.

19:25.731 --> 19:26.998
You might have?

19:26.998 --> 19:29.435
JENNIFER: Hey!
I did.

19:34.173 --> 19:38.244
"Stop messing up
our bathroom, sinkhumpers?"

19:40.379 --> 19:41.713
[LAUGHS]

19:42.581 --> 19:45.484
Jeff. How could you?

19:47.653 --> 19:50.222
Really? You're good.

[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

19:57.196 --> 19:58.697
Ah, yes. Nice to see
everything

19:58.697 --> 19:59.831
back to
neat and tidy.

19:59.831 --> 20:00.699
Mm-hm. Yes, it is.

20:00.699 --> 20:04.002
And again, thank you for
taking the bullet for me.

20:04.336 --> 20:07.138
Speaking of
taking the bullet...

20:07.138 --> 20:09.140
[LAUGHS]
I know. I owe you.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.776
Why don't you
go wait in the bedroom,

20:10.776 --> 20:11.743
and I'll just
finish up here?

20:11.743 --> 20:15.547
Yeah, that's not how
this is gonna go down.

20:17.683 --> 20:18.417
Oh!

20:18.417 --> 20:20.386
What are you doing?

20:20.386 --> 20:22.354
I think you know
what I'm doing.

20:22.354 --> 20:26.157
AUDREY [GIGGLING]:
Uh--! Ow! Watch the faucet.

20:26.157 --> 20:27.693

Sorry.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.502
Funny story.
