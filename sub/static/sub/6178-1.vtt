00:56.306 --> 00:59.260
This is James Henry Trotter.

01:02.438 --> 01:07.599
He lived with his mother and father
in a cosy little house by the sea.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.649
Hey. I've got ya.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.646
Happy birthday, darling.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.443
Now, quickly. Blow them out
before the wind does.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.442
Make a wish first.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.710
It was a wonderful life.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.743
They had each other,
and they had their dreams.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.338
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.471
And that one over there
looks like a train engine.

01:39.099 --> 01:43.429
Now, can you see the tallest
building in the world?

01:47.400 --> 01:49.771
I can't find it.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.027
Try looking at it another way.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.197
I see it!

02:00.287 --> 02:02.446
That's where we're going...

02:02.539 --> 02:05.625
on a great ship that will
take us across the ocean.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.830
And we'll go right to the top
of that building.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.289
The three of us,
on top of the world.

02:12.383 --> 02:15.717
Are there any kids there like me?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.712
Hundreds of them.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.557
It's a wonderful place,James.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.595
A city where dreams come true.

02:23.686 --> 02:27.765
Then, one day,
a terrible thing happened.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.069
An angry rhinoceros
appeared out of nowhere...

02:33.154 --> 02:37.151
and gobbled up
his poor mother and father.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.733
Their troubles--
if they had any at all--

02:39.827 --> 02:42.615
were over in 35 seconds flat.

02:45.667 --> 02:48.751
But James's troubles
were just beginning.

02:48.837 --> 02:52.750
For now, he lives here
with Aunt Sponge...

02:52.840 --> 02:55.296
Get up, you lazy little bug.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.293
and Aunt Spiker.

02:57.386 --> 03:01.053
- You already wasted
four minutes of daylight.
- Look at him.

03:01.141 --> 03:05.802
Lollygagging in dreamland when
there's so much work to be do.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.647
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.

03:08.732 --> 03:11.567
Work, work, work, work, work!

03:57.948 --> 04:00.984
Wouldn't want one of those
nesting in your knickers.

04:02.077 --> 04:06.785
I look and smell--
I do declare--

04:06.874 --> 04:08.784
as lovely as a rose.

04:08.875 --> 04:12.042
Just feast your eyes upon my face.

04:12.128 --> 04:15.829
Observe my shapely nose.

04:15.925 --> 04:20.088
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.

04:20.178 --> 04:24.306
And if I take off
both my socks,

04:24.390 --> 04:27.842
you'll see my dainty toes.

04:27.936 --> 04:31.021
But don't forget,
my dearest Sponge,

04:31.106 --> 04:34.273
how much your tummy shows.

04:48.832 --> 04:51.204
You lazy bug!

04:51.293 --> 04:55.290
- Who told you to stop working?
- I finished the wood.

04:57.132 --> 05:00.502
A travel book? How dare
you even dream of leaving!

05:00.594 --> 05:03.050
This is the only home
you'll ever have.

05:03.139 --> 05:07.302
No one else would tolerate
a worthless little nothing like you.

05:07.393 --> 05:10.726
Where did you get this? Where?

05:10.812 --> 05:13.433
Father gave it to me.
He said we were to go there one day.

05:13.523 --> 05:17.357
- Stupid, foolish man.
- Foolish man. Always dreaming.

05:17.444 --> 05:20.482
- That's what got him killed.
- And your mother.

05:20.573 --> 05:23.823
Had his head in the clouds instead
of looking where he was going!

05:23.909 --> 05:29.035
- He never even saw that rhino coming.
- That rhino.

05:29.123 --> 05:33.369
And the beast will get you, too,
if you don't behave.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.995
Now get these stupid dreams
out of your head!

05:37.089 --> 05:39.497
And get back to work!

05:50.019 --> 05:52.855
Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want
to ruin that girlish figure.

05:52.939 --> 05:54.847
Oh, shut up.

05:58.153 --> 06:00.442
- Yes?
- I've finished all of the chores.

06:00.530 --> 06:04.776
What a coincidence.
We've finished all the dinner.

06:04.868 --> 06:07.109
Oh, Sponge.
You're such a tease.

06:07.204 --> 06:10.537
There's something special
waiting for you in the oven.

06:19.757 --> 06:22.130
Oh, do let me guess.

06:22.219 --> 06:24.258
They're not good enough for him.

06:24.345 --> 06:26.718
What do you think this is?
Buckingham Palace?

06:29.726 --> 06:31.765
Get out of our sight!

06:31.853 --> 06:33.762
Go on!

06:34.730 --> 06:36.474
Go on!

07:14.563 --> 07:17.931
Hello there!
Where did you come from?

07:18.025 --> 07:21.974
You know, you probably shouldn't
build your web up here in the window.

07:22.071 --> 07:25.688
Spiker and Sponge might see you,
and they hate spiders.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.449
I'll be your friend, though.

07:30.537 --> 07:35.163
<i>My name is James</i>

07:35.251 --> 07:39.794
<i>That's what Mother called me</i>

07:39.880 --> 07:44.257
<i>My name is James</i>

07:44.343 --> 07:47.628
<i>So it's always been</i>

07:49.432 --> 07:53.215
<i>Sometimes I forget</i>

07:53.310 --> 07:58.221
<i>When I'm lonely or afraid</i>

07:58.315 --> 08:03.227
<i>Then I'll go inside my head</i>

08:03.320 --> 08:08.694
<i>And look for James</i>

08:08.784 --> 08:11.488
Here's something
I've never shown anyone.

08:16.959 --> 08:21.502
<i>There's a city that I dreamed of</i>

08:21.589 --> 08:26.417
<i>Very far from here</i>

08:26.511 --> 08:31.256
<i>Very, very far away from here</i>

08:31.348 --> 08:36.342
<i>Very far away</i>

08:36.437 --> 08:40.980
<i>There are people in the city</i>

08:41.067 --> 08:45.479
<i>And they're kind to me</i>

08:45.571 --> 08:50.945
<i>But it's very, very far away
you know</i>

08:51.035 --> 08:53.609
<i>Very far</i>

08:55.374 --> 08:58.991
<i>They'll say, James, James</i>

08:59.085 --> 09:02.169
<i>James, how are ya</i>

09:02.254 --> 09:06.253
<i>Isn't it a lovely day</i>

09:07.761 --> 09:11.675
<i>James, James, James</i>

09:11.764 --> 09:15.548
<i>We're so glad you came here</i>

09:15.644 --> 09:17.683
<i>Where we are</i>

09:17.770 --> 09:24.308
<i>From so very, very, very far</i>

09:24.402 --> 09:29.194
<i>My name is James</i>

09:29.283 --> 09:33.363
<i>James, James</i>

09:48.468 --> 09:50.876
Good night. Pleasant dreams.

09:58.479 --> 10:01.313
Spider! Vermin! Oh, beast!

10:03.192 --> 10:05.184
No! Wait!

10:05.277 --> 10:08.942
- Spider!
- Wait! I'll get it! I'll get it!

10:09.030 --> 10:12.612
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

10:12.700 --> 10:15.785
Where is it?

10:22.837 --> 10:24.875
Get it! Get it!

10:24.963 --> 10:26.920
- Kill it.
- Get it! Get it!

10:27.007 --> 10:29.629
Kill it!

10:32.429 --> 10:35.217
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!

10:35.307 --> 10:37.264
Oh, do shut up!

10:44.691 --> 10:49.104
Go on. Get out of here. Get as far away
from this place as you possibly can.

10:49.196 --> 10:52.114
Oh, I wish I could.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.192
What's stopping you?

10:54.284 --> 10:57.654
Oh, don't be frightened,James.
I mean you no harm.

10:59.122 --> 11:02.574
How'd you know my name?

11:02.667 --> 11:05.206
I know more than just your name.

11:06.797 --> 11:10.048
What would you say
if I were to tell you...

11:10.134 --> 11:13.917
that the answer to all
your troubles is right here...

11:14.012 --> 11:16.006
inside this little bag?

11:16.099 --> 11:19.183
- Hey! That's my--
- Of course it is.

11:19.268 --> 11:22.804
Go on,James. Have a look.

11:22.897 --> 11:25.934
There's more magic
in them things...

11:26.025 --> 11:28.267
than in all the rest
of the world put together.

11:28.361 --> 11:30.767
But what are they?

11:30.862 --> 11:33.899
- Crocodile tongues.
- Tongues?

11:33.991 --> 11:37.574
One thousand long,
slimy crocodile tongues.

11:37.662 --> 11:41.493
Boiled in the skull of a dead witch
for 20 days and 20 nights.

11:41.582 --> 11:45.034
Add the fingers of a young
monkey, the gizzard of a pig,

11:45.128 --> 11:48.044
the beak of a parrot
and three spoonfuls of sugar.

11:48.130 --> 11:52.129
Stew for a week,
and then let the moon...

11:52.218 --> 11:54.424
do the rest.

11:54.512 --> 11:58.261
Have 'em, and marvelous things
will happen.

11:58.349 --> 12:01.220
Things even you never dreamt of.

12:01.311 --> 12:04.928
- Like what?
- Well, like...

12:05.023 --> 12:07.810
you'll never be miserable again.

12:07.900 --> 12:12.609
And you are miserable,
aren't you,James?

12:12.697 --> 12:14.607
You weren't meant to be, you know.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.321
And that place you're dreamin' of,

12:17.410 --> 12:20.079
it's not as far away as you think.

12:25.043 --> 12:27.166
New York City!

12:27.254 --> 12:31.203
And it'll be that much closer,
once you take the first step.

12:31.299 --> 12:34.751
But how? This doesn't
make any sense.

12:34.844 --> 12:37.003
Not up here, it doesn't.

12:37.097 --> 12:39.385
The answers are in here,

12:39.474 --> 12:42.429
and the magic is in here.

12:44.229 --> 12:47.099
So,James, what'll it be?

12:54.657 --> 12:59.283
Now listen to me,James. Don't let them
get away, because if they do,

12:59.369 --> 13:04.495
they'll work their magic on whoever
or whatever they meet first.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.205
Understand?

13:07.295 --> 13:09.501
Good.

13:21.558 --> 13:25.307
What's going on out here?

13:34.362 --> 13:36.321
No! No, wait!

13:39.659 --> 13:42.151
Wait! No! No, wait!

13:47.500 --> 13:50.952
Wait.Just a-- Wait.

13:51.046 --> 13:53.917
Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!

13:54.008 --> 13:57.127
- We sent you out here to kill a spider.
- Not to laze about.

13:57.219 --> 13:59.888
I wasn't lazing about.
I tripped.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.011
How dare you disagree with us!

14:02.099 --> 14:04.256
Beat him, Sponge.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.430
It's too early.

14:08.524 --> 14:11.310
Well, that makes you
the luckiest boy alive.

14:11.401 --> 14:13.890
Now come inside and get dressed.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.736
Spiker, look! A peach.

14:18.824 --> 14:22.691
- A what?
- A peach! There! On that branch.

14:22.786 --> 14:27.579
Why, that old tree's never had so much
as a blossom on it, let alone a--

14:27.666 --> 14:29.624
Well, I'll be blowed.

14:29.710 --> 14:31.833
There really is a peach there.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.875
A nice, big one too.

14:34.966 --> 14:36.874
How can we get it?

14:38.427 --> 14:41.796
- The boy.
- Now, you be a good little boy...

14:41.889 --> 14:45.933
and climb up there and get that
peach for your dear aunties.

14:46.018 --> 14:49.103
- Can we eat it?
- Of course we can. We'll share it.

14:49.188 --> 14:52.225
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.

14:52.316 --> 14:55.353
- Wait!
- What? What? What?

14:55.444 --> 14:57.852
It's-It's growing!

14:57.947 --> 15:00.652
- The boy?
- No. The peach, you idiot!

15:00.742 --> 15:02.651
Look!

15:05.621 --> 15:07.946
- Come down.
- But I won't get hurt.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.950
Climb down!

15:10.043 --> 15:14.586
What a peach. What a peach!

15:14.672 --> 15:17.210
Look, Spiker! It's still growing!

15:17.300 --> 15:20.171
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see it myself.

15:21.470 --> 15:25.421
Look at it go! It's a miracle!

15:26.434 --> 15:30.052
It's coming down. Stand back!

15:30.146 --> 15:32.352
My heavens! My--

15:49.792 --> 15:53.242
Marvelous things will happen,
just like he said.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.294
Shut up, you little grub.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.297
This has nothing to do with you,
so just keep away from it.

16:00.594 --> 16:05.754
Can you smell that, Spikey?
It smells delicious.

16:05.849 --> 16:08.221
No!

16:08.310 --> 16:11.892
It smells like money.

16:16.025 --> 16:19.063
Roll up. Roll up.
See the giant peach.

16:19.154 --> 16:21.147
The Eighth Wonder of the World.

16:21.239 --> 16:23.279
Have your money ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:23.368 --> 16:27.614
Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only.

16:27.705 --> 16:31.749
No peeking at the peach! Have
your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.

16:31.833 --> 16:33.827
In you go.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.335
- Can we touch it?
- Touch it? You want to touch it?

16:37.423 --> 16:41.290
- She'll be wanting to taste it next.
- Admission refused.

16:41.385 --> 16:44.171
This child has too many
cheeky ideas. Go away!

16:44.263 --> 16:47.514
- Quite right.
- Ooh, splendid.

16:48.683 --> 16:50.926
A photographer.

16:52.187 --> 16:54.429
- And another.
- Best side.

16:56.024 --> 16:58.813
- Move on in.
- No cameras allowed.

16:58.903 --> 17:01.110
Don't dawdle. Come along,
ladies and gentlemen!

17:01.197 --> 17:03.948
- Sorry, Father. It'll cost you double.
- May God forgive you.

17:04.032 --> 17:05.941
Thank you, Father.

17:06.034 --> 17:08.869
Come along, children.
Last chance of the day.

17:11.958 --> 17:15.208
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.

17:16.546 --> 17:18.953
Yes, Auntie Sponge?

17:19.048 --> 17:21.373
Ooh! You're all spiffed up.

17:21.467 --> 17:24.421
I was hoping to play
with the children.

17:26.056 --> 17:28.628
The children have gone.

17:28.723 --> 17:31.975
But you can play with their garbage.

17:32.062 --> 17:34.137
Garbage.

17:36.566 --> 17:40.267
And don't even think
of going near our peach.

17:40.362 --> 17:44.573
'Cause if you do, remember:
They never did catch that rhino.

18:17.941 --> 18:20.776
No! Wait a moment! Wait!

19:40.190 --> 19:42.764
'Ere, now. Where do you think
you're going, Yank?

19:42.860 --> 19:45.565
I'm goin' stir crazy.
I gotta take a look around.

19:45.654 --> 19:47.612
Plan our escape
from Spiker and Sponge.

19:47.699 --> 19:51.945
Escape? To where? We'll all be
squashed, swatted, smooshed!

19:52.036 --> 19:55.404
No one's going to smoosh you,
my dear boy.

19:55.497 --> 19:58.250
- You're six feet long now.
- Bigger target.

19:58.335 --> 20:01.785
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.

20:01.879 --> 20:04.915
I'm indefeatable.
I'm indivisible. I'm...

20:05.007 --> 20:07.130
- Whoa!
- in trouble!

20:09.095 --> 20:11.800
It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've found us!

20:11.890 --> 20:14.261
Hello!

20:14.350 --> 20:17.469
No, no, no. It's the lad
from the house. What's his name?

20:17.561 --> 20:20.765
- Miserable tick.
- I thought it was " rotten little grub.''

20:20.857 --> 20:23.312
No. That's what those
horrible aunts call him.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.401
His real name is--
Well, it's-- uh, uh--

20:26.487 --> 20:28.563
It's James.

20:28.657 --> 20:32.191
Look what you've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.

20:32.284 --> 20:34.657
Please! Don't eat me!

20:34.745 --> 20:37.747
- Eat you?
- Hey, Glow-worm. Turn up your lights.

20:41.002 --> 20:43.836
- I'm a vegetarian.
- I eat dirt.

20:43.921 --> 20:45.831
No one will be eating you,James.

20:45.924 --> 20:49.506
Nah. She'll just puncture your
head and suck out the brains.

20:49.594 --> 20:53.508
- That I am saving for you.
- Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.851
Oh, such rude behaviour.

20:57.935 --> 21:00.343
There's no need
to be frightened, dearie.

21:00.438 --> 21:02.645
But you're enormous bugs!

21:02.732 --> 21:04.559
Fascinating, isn't it?

21:04.650 --> 21:08.482
We've all changed,
and so have you,James.

21:09.948 --> 21:13.567
The old man-- the one who
gave me the green things--

21:13.659 --> 21:15.735
he said marvelous things
would happen.

21:15.828 --> 21:18.497
Did he say,
"marvelous pigs in satin''?

21:18.582 --> 21:22.829
No, dear lady.
"Marvelous things will happen.''

21:22.919 --> 21:25.671
Poor Glow-worm.
She's a little deaf.

21:25.755 --> 21:28.211
I, however, have exquisite hearing.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.458
Yeah? Well, listen to this.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.890
Let's get outta here!

21:34.973 --> 21:38.721
You mean leave the hill?
I can't! The rhino will get me.

21:38.809 --> 21:40.887
Rhino?

21:40.979 --> 21:42.887
I say, dear boy.

21:42.980 --> 21:45.187
I've lived on this
miserable hill for decades.

21:45.275 --> 21:47.185
There are no rhinoceri here.

21:47.278 --> 21:52.021
Except for Sponge.
She's twice as big as a rhino, eh, kid?

21:52.114 --> 21:55.366
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.

21:55.452 --> 21:59.117
I've had to send all 300
of me children to safer pastures.

21:59.206 --> 22:02.242
Hah! You think hiding
in solid rock is fun?

22:02.334 --> 22:04.457
I can't even remember what fun is.

22:04.545 --> 22:07.250
Well, that's just 'cause
you been stuck here too long.

22:07.338 --> 22:11.384
Listen to me, kid. I know a place
that will refresh your memory.

22:12.510 --> 22:14.588
<i>Bright lights
Big city</i>

22:14.679 --> 22:16.886
<i>That's where we gotta go</i>

22:16.973 --> 22:20.010
<i>Where the food is great
and the bugs are so pretty</i>

22:20.101 --> 22:22.594
<i>I'd like to get my arms
around a hundred or so</i>

22:22.688 --> 22:25.605
<i>I'd hug 'em, squeeze 'em
hold 'em tight</i>

22:25.691 --> 22:27.648
<i>Sleep all day
Dance all night</i>

22:27.735 --> 22:30.854
<i>I want the bright lights
and the big city</i>

22:30.946 --> 22:34.944
<i>That's the life for me, yeah
That's the life for--</i>

22:35.033 --> 22:38.817
<i>You little maggot
Have you never seen the moon</i>

22:38.913 --> 22:42.826
<i>Gliding 'cross the western sky</i>

22:42.916 --> 22:47.293
<i>A dead oak tree by the waterside</i>

22:47.378 --> 22:51.542
<i>Putrid vapours rising</i>

22:53.385 --> 22:56.469
That sounds lovely, dear.
I'm sure we all agree.

22:56.554 --> 22:58.714
<i>But I prefer the sunshine</i>

22:58.807 --> 23:02.639
<i>A little park right in
the centre of the town</i>

23:02.728 --> 23:07.853
<i>Flowers everywhere
Children all around me, I'd love it</i>

23:07.942 --> 23:11.691
<i>Landing on a baby's cheek so warm</i>

23:11.779 --> 23:15.314
<i>- It's wonderful
- Wonderful</i>

23:15.407 --> 23:19.452
<i>That's the life for me</i>

23:19.536 --> 23:23.368
<i>That's the life for me</i>

23:23.458 --> 23:27.621
<i>That's the life
That's the life for me</i>

23:30.423 --> 23:34.171
<i>- Elegant conversation
- Bright lights, big city</i>

23:34.260 --> 23:37.842
<i>- An elevated point of view
- That's where I'd go</i>

23:37.930 --> 23:41.714
<i>- Intellectual stimulation
- Yeah, maybe for you.</i>

23:41.809 --> 23:45.937
<i>And someone you love
to share it with you</i>

23:48.607 --> 23:51.360
<i>It would be wonderful</i>

23:51.444 --> 23:53.353
<i>Wonderful</i>

23:53.446 --> 23:57.029
<i>- That's the life for me
- You call that a life?</i>

23:57.117 --> 24:00.615
<i>- That's the life for me
- It's no pile of dirt.</i>

24:00.704 --> 24:03.195
<i>That's the life
That's the life</i>

24:03.289 --> 24:07.287
<i>That's the life
That's the life for--</i>

24:07.376 --> 24:09.535
Where are you hiding, boy?

24:09.629 --> 24:12.832
Time to go make a pest of myself.

24:14.050 --> 24:17.917
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.

24:18.012 --> 24:21.048
Where are you,
you detestable little worm?

24:21.141 --> 24:23.596
Not you. Me!

24:23.685 --> 24:26.851
You better not be near our peach.

24:26.937 --> 24:29.476
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!

24:29.566 --> 24:33.183
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up there
and come after us with a shovel.

24:33.277 --> 24:35.686
- It happened to my brother.
- How awful.

24:35.780 --> 24:39.612
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.

24:39.702 --> 24:42.536
Shh! They'll hear us.

24:44.205 --> 24:47.290
Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?

24:47.375 --> 24:51.420
I think I hear a rhino out here.

24:53.465 --> 24:56.039
Ahh. This'll be a snap.

24:58.177 --> 25:01.797
Shh! I really do hear something.

25:09.398 --> 25:11.722
Timber.

25:14.527 --> 25:16.852
- What's that?
- Fasten your seat belts, kids.

25:17.948 --> 25:20.782
Ahh! The car!

25:20.867 --> 25:23.738
- We're turning!
- Wha-Wha-What have you done?

25:27.040 --> 25:29.248
Start, start, you piece of junk.

25:37.885 --> 25:40.210
It's the peach! Our peach!
We'll be killed!

25:45.308 --> 25:48.428
Whoa! I'm falling head
over head over head!

26:11.127 --> 26:14.164
Here, stomach! Here, stomach!
Here, stomach!

26:23.473 --> 26:25.512
I'm gonna be sick.

26:31.898 --> 26:35.432
Our peach!

26:46.371 --> 26:48.528
Where are we?

26:48.622 --> 26:51.196
Ow! Somebody pinched me.

26:51.292 --> 26:53.914
Sorry. I thought
you were the spider.

26:54.003 --> 26:56.459
Ouch! What was that?

26:56.547 --> 26:58.955
Excuse. I thought
you were the centipede.

26:59.049 --> 27:01.458
Hey, Glow-worm.
How about some light?

27:01.553 --> 27:04.423
I can't hear you, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.

27:04.514 --> 27:08.131
Oh! Oh! This is
so "unladybug-like.''

27:08.226 --> 27:12.271
Don't worry. I'll have you
right-side up in no time.

27:12.356 --> 27:14.311
Thank you,James.

27:14.398 --> 27:17.316
- Where are you going?
- To see where we've landed.

27:24.701 --> 27:26.908
Whoa!

27:36.338 --> 27:38.247
Oh, my!

27:38.340 --> 27:40.463
Oh, my, my.

27:40.550 --> 27:43.919
Oh, my achin' back.

27:44.846 --> 27:47.218
Oh!

27:47.307 --> 27:49.347
Fascinating, isn't it?

27:49.435 --> 27:53.135
What? What's fascinating?
Tell me. Don't leave me dangling.

27:53.230 --> 27:57.939
We're in the middle of the--
how do you say-- the big puddle?

27:58.026 --> 28:02.772
Biggest puddle of them all,
angel fangs. The Atlantic Ocean.

28:02.865 --> 28:05.319
Technically,
the Pacific is larger.

28:05.409 --> 28:08.695
Well, that goes without saying.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.447
But there is land in sight?

28:10.539 --> 28:13.030
Nothing but blue skies
and clear waters.

28:14.918 --> 28:16.959
- This is all your fault.
- Hey!

28:17.046 --> 28:20.497
If it wasn't for me, we'd all
be Spiked and Sponged by now!

28:20.591 --> 28:22.832
This old man
with his green things--

28:22.926 --> 28:25.548
did he happen to speak
to where we are going?

28:25.638 --> 28:29.884
No. All he said was
the answers would be right here.

28:32.228 --> 28:34.801
My travel book!

28:34.897 --> 28:38.313
And look! It's the peach!

28:38.400 --> 28:42.065
We're going to New York City!

28:42.153 --> 28:44.727
New York? They love me there!

28:44.823 --> 28:48.573
Wonderful! They've got a whole park
full of leaves for you, Miss Ladybug.

28:48.661 --> 28:51.578
- Central Park.
- And loads of dark hiding places.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.989
- Nightclubs.
- And museums and concerts.

28:54.083 --> 28:57.000
- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
- What about me?

28:57.085 --> 28:59.837
Why, they've got miles and miles
of underground tunnels.

28:59.923 --> 29:01.085
The subway!

29:01.173 --> 29:04.340
My father says it's the place
where dreams come true.

29:04.427 --> 29:07.877
<i>- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me</i>

29:07.971 --> 29:11.555
<i>- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me</i>

29:11.642 --> 29:14.513
<i>- That's the life
- That's the life</i>

29:14.604 --> 29:16.062
<i>That's the life</i>

29:16.147 --> 29:21.935
<i>That's the life for me</i>

29:22.027 --> 29:24.697
New York it is, then.

29:24.780 --> 29:26.903
Now, how do we get there?

29:26.991 --> 29:29.279
- I'll get us there!
- You?

29:29.368 --> 29:32.903
Sure! I've sailed
all the five seas.

29:32.997 --> 29:35.534
From the sun-drenched reefs
of Bora Bora...

29:35.624 --> 29:39.540
to the icy shores of Tripoli.

29:39.629 --> 29:42.915
"Commodore Centipede,''
they used to call me.

29:43.006 --> 29:44.916
- Seven.
- Huh?

29:45.009 --> 29:47.049
There are seven seas,

29:47.137 --> 29:51.466
and Tripoli is
in the subtropics, Commodore.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.642
- Trim the sails!
- There are no sails.

29:54.727 --> 29:57.349
- Stoke the engine!
- There are no engines.

29:57.438 --> 29:59.846
I can't work
with this miserable crew.

29:59.941 --> 30:03.356
Great! We're stuck here
until we shrivel up and die.

30:03.444 --> 30:05.734
- Highly improbable.
- That's a relief.

30:05.823 --> 30:07.944
We're far more likely to drown.

30:08.032 --> 30:10.701
Oh, no!

30:12.119 --> 30:14.159
I know! We could--

30:14.247 --> 30:16.737
No. It's a stupid idea.

30:16.832 --> 30:19.075
- Compared to what?
- Hey!

30:19.169 --> 30:23.036
Well, we could fly out.

30:23.131 --> 30:25.373
He's right. It's stupid.

30:25.466 --> 30:27.376
How would you do it,James?

30:27.468 --> 30:30.220
With the seagulls,
but we'll need string.

30:30.305 --> 30:32.262
Oh. Well, I'll just go
to the stationer's...

30:32.348 --> 30:34.507
and pick up some paper clips
while I'm at it.

30:34.601 --> 30:38.433
I have string.
Miles of string.

30:38.522 --> 30:41.772
And we'll need bait; bird bait.

30:41.858 --> 30:45.642
Bird bait? Where do you expect
we're gonna find bird bait...

30:45.738 --> 30:48.524
out here in the middle
of the-- the--

30:48.615 --> 30:51.985
Oh, no! No, no!

30:52.077 --> 30:55.446
Have you lost your minds?

30:55.539 --> 30:57.496
They've lost their minds!

30:57.583 --> 30:59.540
Anything but birds!

30:59.627 --> 31:01.832
Don't worry. I'm right here.

31:01.919 --> 31:03.829
- Now wiggle.
- No!

31:03.923 --> 31:05.797
But they won't come
if you don't wiggle.

31:05.883 --> 31:08.290
Exactly!
And you can't make me.

31:08.385 --> 31:10.295
Oh, yeah?

31:13.723 --> 31:17.389
Hey, no fair! Mockingbirds
munched me mother!

31:19.979 --> 31:23.599
Here comes the first one.
Get ready to pull down there.

31:23.692 --> 31:26.610
My sisters were swallowed
by swallows!

31:27.989 --> 31:30.561
Pull!

31:37.748 --> 31:40.618
It worked! I got one!

31:40.835 --> 31:42.707
Shh! I hear teeth.

31:42.794 --> 31:45.417
Great, big, gnashing teeth.

31:45.506 --> 31:48.341
Sounds like a rhinoceros.

31:48.426 --> 31:52.554
In the ocean?
Scientifically impossible.

31:52.638 --> 31:55.805
I hear something too.

31:55.891 --> 31:58.097
It's a school of tuna.

31:58.185 --> 32:00.557
They're being sucked
into some sort of machine.

32:00.646 --> 32:03.600
- What do you mean?
- Take a look.

32:07.904 --> 32:09.979
It's a giant shark!

32:14.660 --> 32:17.448
It seems to have spotted us.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.501
- What do we do? What do we do?
- The seagulls!

32:23.586 --> 32:25.246
It's our only chance!

32:25.338 --> 32:29.418
It would take the whole flock and
then some. We'll never do it in time.

32:29.508 --> 32:31.880
We'll use Miss Spider's web
for a net. Hurry!

32:35.055 --> 32:37.677
Throw it here, dearie.

32:41.311 --> 32:43.934
Wiggle, Mr Earthworm.
Our lives depend on it.

32:44.023 --> 32:46.858
I can't! I'm all wiggled out.

32:47.944 --> 32:51.563
Here. Let me help you.

32:51.656 --> 32:56.816
Come and get it!
Get your fresh, hot wienie!

32:59.454 --> 33:02.029
Come on, baby.

33:04.919 --> 33:09.380
I got 'em! Hand me the loops!

33:09.465 --> 33:11.375
- Hurry!
- Shake a leg, there.

33:11.469 --> 33:14.172
Keep your pants on.
I've only got 1 2 hands.

33:17.391 --> 33:20.059
It's getting closer.

33:20.143 --> 33:22.301
Seagulls, away!

33:37.701 --> 33:39.861
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear!

33:53.635 --> 33:56.008
They're getting away!

33:56.096 --> 33:58.765
Hop on,James!

33:58.849 --> 34:01.423
Now, grab them!

34:06.065 --> 34:09.231
Help!

34:13.697 --> 34:16.485
Hooligans! Ruffians!

34:16.574 --> 34:18.734
Degenerates!

34:24.958 --> 34:28.245
- Come on, seagulls!
- Put your backs into it!

34:28.337 --> 34:30.495
Shake your bloomin' tail feathers!

34:32.759 --> 34:35.331
Good sharky. Nice sharky.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.964
Sharky!

35:08.002 --> 35:09.958
Hooray!

35:10.046 --> 35:15.669
All right! Teach you to mess
with me, you overgrown sardine!

35:15.759 --> 35:18.333
I'm from Brooklyn.

35:18.429 --> 35:23.175
Pure twaddle! Every bug on board
displayed extraordinary courage.

35:23.268 --> 35:26.054
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug
risk life and wing...

35:26.145 --> 35:28.684
to bash those brutes
on the snoot?

35:28.773 --> 35:32.688
Well, they were being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.

35:32.777 --> 35:34.686
We are all
forgetting something.

35:34.778 --> 35:38.314
Everything we did was part
of the brilliant plan of James.

35:38.407 --> 35:42.275
It really did work, didn't it?

35:42.370 --> 35:46.747
- I say three cheers for James. Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

35:46.833 --> 35:48.540
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

35:48.626 --> 35:51.497
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

35:52.463 --> 35:54.919
New York,

35:55.008 --> 35:57.759
here we come!

36:15.529 --> 36:17.984
Whoever you are,
keep away from me! Keep away!

36:18.072 --> 36:21.774
Mr Earthworm, it's me!

36:21.868 --> 36:24.157
Oh,James!
Oh, thank goodness.

36:24.245 --> 36:27.033
You mustn't frighten yourself
like this all the time.

36:27.123 --> 36:29.994
- Why not?
- You'll make yourself sick.

36:30.085 --> 36:34.378
When I had a problem, my mum and dad
would tell me to look at it another way.

36:34.464 --> 36:38.248
How? First I was bird bait.
Then I was shark bait.

36:38.343 --> 36:42.423
I suppose. Or you could say
you gave us wings to fly...

36:42.513 --> 36:46.014
and defeated a giant shark
single-handedly.

36:46.101 --> 36:49.801
- No-handedly.
- Exactly. You're a hero.

36:49.897 --> 36:53.978
I am? I'm Wonder Worm!

36:54.067 --> 36:56.024
You are.

37:07.872 --> 37:10.114
Want food.

37:10.208 --> 37:12.118
Food.

37:16.548 --> 37:18.872
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

37:18.967 --> 37:21.424
I don't see how you can navigate
without a compass.

37:25.557 --> 37:28.262
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.

37:41.114 --> 37:45.575
- Unhand that bird!
- But I'm dyin' of hunger.

37:45.660 --> 37:48.746
Well, perhaps I have a bit
of soda bread in here somewhere.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.404
- Food?
- It's not much, but it's--

37:51.500 --> 37:53.161
- Not so fast!
- Hey!
- You?

37:53.252 --> 37:55.873
I need this food.
I have a much higher metabolism.

37:55.963 --> 37:58.455
- Bite me!
- What?
- Have you two gone mad?

37:58.549 --> 38:00.541
Let go of it, gramps!

38:00.634 --> 38:02.628
- Give it! Give it to me!
- Let go of my coat!
- Give it to me!

38:02.720 --> 38:04.843
- Ow! My lower thorax.
- I'll rip you apart!

38:04.930 --> 38:07.256
- I tell you, it's mine!
- Give it back!

38:11.395 --> 38:13.602
Now look what you've done!

38:13.689 --> 38:17.639
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.

38:17.735 --> 38:21.733
Oh, no. That would be
the easy way out. We'll linger.

38:21.823 --> 38:25.026
Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.

38:25.117 --> 38:28.320
Nobody's going to starve.

38:28.412 --> 38:32.456
Don't you see? We have enough
food here for five voyages.

38:32.542 --> 38:35.163
- Food? Where?
- Is there really food?
- What are you talkin' about?

38:35.254 --> 38:37.210
Our whole ship is made of food.

38:37.296 --> 38:40.748
Oh, such a clever little boy.

38:40.842 --> 38:42.253
Takes after me.

38:42.343 --> 38:44.750
After you,
there is nothing left to take.

38:45.596 --> 38:47.672
Delectable!

38:47.765 --> 38:51.181
- Better than aphids.
- Better than ladybugs.

38:51.269 --> 38:53.345
- What?
- Excuse.

38:53.439 --> 38:57.270
It's not dirt, but it's not bad.

38:57.358 --> 39:00.561
"Not bad''? It's the best thing
I've ever tasted,

39:00.653 --> 39:03.654
and I have tasted a lot.

39:10.830 --> 39:15.409
<i>I've eaten many strange
and scrumptious dishes in my time</i>

39:15.501 --> 39:18.171
<i>Like chilli bugs
and curried slugs</i>

39:18.255 --> 39:21.125
<i>And earwigs
cooked in slime</i>

39:21.216 --> 39:23.968
<i>And mice with rice
is very nice</i>

39:24.052 --> 39:27.302
<i>When they're roasted
in their prime</i>

39:27.389 --> 39:31.885
<i>But don't forget to sprinkle them
with just a pinch of grime</i>

39:38.233 --> 39:41.399
<i>I'm crazy 'bout mosquitos
on a piece of buttered toast</i>

39:41.485 --> 39:45.104
<i>And pickled spines of porcupines
and then a great, big roast</i>

39:45.199 --> 39:47.156
<i>And dragon's flesh
Quite old, not fresh</i>

39:47.243 --> 39:49.780
<i>It costs a buck at most</i>

39:49.870 --> 39:52.492
Does it come with gravy?

39:52.581 --> 39:55.914
<i>It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post</i>

40:06.302 --> 40:09.506
<i>It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post</i>

40:09.639 --> 40:11.716
<i>For dinner on my birthday</i>

40:11.808 --> 40:14.180
<i>Shall I tell you
what I chose</i>

40:14.270 --> 40:19.181
<i>Hot noodles made of poodles
on a slice of garden hose</i>

40:19.275 --> 40:21.847
<i>And a rather smelly jelly</i>

40:21.944 --> 40:24.612
<i>Made of armadillos' toes</i>

40:24.696 --> 40:27.022
<i>The jelly is delicious</i>

40:27.116 --> 40:31.244
<i>But you have to hold
your nose</i>

40:31.328 --> 40:34.662
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

40:34.749 --> 40:37.584
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

40:37.668 --> 40:41.038
<i>I crave the tasty tentacles
of octopi for tea</i>

40:41.130 --> 40:46.255
<i>I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs
and surely you'll agree</i>

40:46.343 --> 40:50.258
<i>A plate of soil with engine oil's
a super recipe</i>

40:50.347 --> 40:53.017
<i>Recipe</i>

40:53.100 --> 40:55.592
<i>I hardly need to mention
that it's practically free</i>

40:55.687 --> 40:58.259
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

40:58.355 --> 41:01.439
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

41:01.525 --> 41:06.436
<i>We hardly need to mention
that it's practically free</i>

41:06.531 --> 41:11.276
<i>Now comes, my fellow travelers
the burden of my speech</i>

41:11.368 --> 41:15.781
<i>- You show-off!
- These foods are rare, beyond compare</i>

41:15.873 --> 41:19.159
<i>And some right out of reach</i>

41:19.252 --> 41:21.208
Nice aim, Commodore.

41:21.295 --> 41:24.129
<i>But there's no doubt
I'd go without</i>

41:24.215 --> 41:27.834
<i>A million plates of each</i>

41:27.928 --> 41:29.884
Out of my face!

41:29.971 --> 41:32.888
<i>- For one small mite
- One small mite</i>

41:32.974 --> 41:34.966
<i>One tiny bite</i>

41:35.059 --> 41:44.811
<i>Tiny bite
of this fantastic peach</i>

41:44.903 --> 41:47.903
<i>- Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Stop! Stop!</i>

41:47.989 --> 41:50.659
<i>- Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Wha-Wha-Wha-What's going on?</i>

41:50.741 --> 41:54.158
- Bull's-eye!
- Comin' at you!
- Watch this!

41:54.246 --> 41:56.202
<i>This fantastic peach</i>

42:24.943 --> 42:26.853
You keep to yourself, don't you?

42:26.946 --> 42:29.352
I prefer to be alone.

42:29.447 --> 42:32.448
I was alone
for a long time once.

42:32.534 --> 42:35.868
I think it's much nicer
to have friends. Don't you?

42:35.955 --> 42:37.911
I would not know.

42:37.997 --> 42:42.493
They would be your friends too-- the
others, I mean-- if you'd just let them.

42:42.585 --> 42:45.503
No. It is in their nature
to have fear of me.

42:45.588 --> 42:49.421
- This I cannot change.
- You're very kind to me.

42:49.509 --> 42:54.385
Maybe this is because
you are kind to me first.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.929
You were the spider in my window!

42:58.770 --> 43:00.927
You were my first friend.

43:01.021 --> 43:04.472
I mean, since I went
to live with my aunts.

43:04.566 --> 43:08.813
- They hated me!
- Shh! Do not think of them now.

43:08.903 --> 43:10.813
But what if they find us?

43:10.907 --> 43:13.574
What if we don't make it
to New York?

43:13.659 --> 43:18.285
I'll die if I have to go back to
the way I was! They can't make me!

43:18.372 --> 43:23.828
Nobody can make you do anything,
James, if you do not let them.

43:23.918 --> 43:27.253
You are a brave boy.

43:27.339 --> 43:29.747
Now, to sleep.

43:29.842 --> 43:32.879
You have had
a very tired-making day.

44:11.342 --> 44:16.004
Look! The little maggot's
stuffing his face with our peach!

44:16.096 --> 44:18.553
Get him, Sponge.

44:20.018 --> 44:22.722
You can't crawl away from us!

44:36.826 --> 44:40.609
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.

44:40.704 --> 44:44.489
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.

44:44.584 --> 44:48.533
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.

44:48.629 --> 44:51.334
The rhino will get you!

45:21.371 --> 45:23.494
This is an outrage!

45:23.582 --> 45:27.282
You are a disgrace to your phylum,
class, order, genus and species!

45:27.377 --> 45:30.164
- Say it in English!
- You, sir, are an ass!

45:30.254 --> 45:33.043
Where are we?
What's going on?

45:33.133 --> 45:36.965
I found this dime-store Timmy
asleep at the helm.

45:37.054 --> 45:39.379
- Now we're lost.
- We are not lost!

45:39.473 --> 45:41.715
- Then where are we?
- Somewhere north!

45:41.808 --> 45:43.717
Or possibly
very, very far south.

45:43.810 --> 45:46.219
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?

45:46.314 --> 45:49.148
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.

45:49.232 --> 45:53.064
- You said you could navigate!
- You said you'd traveled the world.

45:53.153 --> 45:55.193
You said you'd been to Bora Bora.

45:55.281 --> 46:00.073
- Well, not Bora Bora, per se. Uh--
- What about the shores of Tripoli?

46:00.161 --> 46:04.240
Did I say "Tripoli''?
I meant the halls of Montezuma.

46:04.331 --> 46:06.324
- That's what you said.
- Never have I heard such mendacity!

46:06.416 --> 46:08.659
- You liar.
- Charlatan!
- Wait!

46:08.752 --> 46:12.252
If he says he's seen the world,
then he's seen the world.

46:12.339 --> 46:15.294
Right, Mr Centipede?
Right?

46:15.384 --> 46:20.544
<i>Well, I did used to live between
two pages of a National Geographic.</i>

46:20.638 --> 46:25.930
<i>-Huh?
-Very informative magazine, the National
Geographic. Wonderful pictures.</i>

46:26.020 --> 46:30.930
You incompetent,
blithering nitwit!

46:31.024 --> 46:34.144
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words!

46:34.235 --> 46:37.355
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on! Give me your best shot!

46:38.866 --> 46:43.528
Whoa! Good shot.
Did you see what he did to me?

46:43.620 --> 46:46.906
Hmph! Serves ya right.

46:46.998 --> 46:50.783
- What do we do now? Which way do we go?
- Oh, it's simple, really.

46:50.877 --> 46:52.870
All we need to do
is determine our coordinates,

46:52.964 --> 46:55.964
then use triangulation to chart
a direct route to New York.

46:56.049 --> 46:58.043
- Then there's hope.
- Don't be ridiculous.

46:58.136 --> 47:01.469
There's no hope at all.
We don't have a compass.

47:01.556 --> 47:03.513
We'll never reach New York.

47:03.599 --> 47:05.639
We're gonna be stuck here forever.

47:05.727 --> 47:08.479
We're gonna be frozen
like living statues.

47:08.563 --> 47:10.722
Dead living statues.

47:10.814 --> 47:13.270
No dark hiding places.

47:13.359 --> 47:16.360
No cosy leaf in the park.

47:16.446 --> 47:20.906
No city where dreams come true.

47:20.992 --> 47:23.696
- Don't ships have compasses?
- No doubt.

47:23.785 --> 47:28.532
But to brave those icy waters
would mean certain death.

47:28.624 --> 47:30.582
Only a fool would do it.

47:33.254 --> 47:35.496
Geronimo!

47:35.589 --> 47:38.163
- What? What? What was that?
- The centipede jumped in!

47:38.259 --> 47:41.461
Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide!

47:41.554 --> 47:43.511
Oh, this is all my doing.

47:43.598 --> 47:46.005
Don't take all the credit.
I helped too.

47:46.100 --> 47:50.181
- I have to go after him!
- Not on your life. You'll catch
your death of cold.

47:50.271 --> 47:53.059
- But he's my friend!
-James is right.

47:53.149 --> 47:56.685
Centipede is one of us.
Get on my back. I am going with you.

47:56.778 --> 47:59.862
- You had better take good care of him.
- This I promise.

47:59.947 --> 48:03.068
Stay by the line, and when
you feel two tugs, pull us up.

48:30.895 --> 48:33.304
A skellington?

48:39.820 --> 48:42.527
Jackpot! A genuine compass!

48:44.743 --> 48:47.234
Sounds like you need
a little oil, Captain.

48:48.580 --> 48:51.665
Thank you, sir!
I'll be shovin' off now.

48:58.840 --> 49:01.167
I shoulda worn a belt!

49:04.222 --> 49:07.138
Holy shipwreck!

49:21.863 --> 49:25.067
Listen, fellas. I got
a long history of back problems,

49:25.159 --> 49:28.195
and I don't need it
to get any longer.

49:33.042 --> 49:34.998
Hey. That one felt pretty good.

49:37.046 --> 49:39.962
It's Paul Bunyan comin'
to cut me some slack.

49:40.049 --> 49:43.464
Whoa! Hey, pal.
You're aimin' a little low.

49:43.552 --> 49:45.794
He's gonna cut me in half!

49:49.349 --> 49:53.477
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?

49:56.606 --> 49:58.564
Cut me loose!

50:04.657 --> 50:06.649
Get the compass!

50:10.913 --> 50:13.997
I've got it!

50:22.717 --> 50:24.626
Gotcha!

50:26.012 --> 50:28.385
Polly want a smacker?

50:30.183 --> 50:32.342
Look out!

50:35.271 --> 50:37.892
- Sounds like big trouble.
- Get ready to pull.

50:41.611 --> 50:45.941
I got a good one for ya. Why don't
skeletons play music in church?

51:05.759 --> 51:08.466
Oh. Thank goodness!
You're all right.

51:08.554 --> 51:11.093
- What happened to Centipede?
- He found a compass for us.

51:11.182 --> 51:15.132
- And a shipload of pirates!
- Hold this. I am going back.

51:15.228 --> 51:17.517
Do be careful, Miss Spider.

51:25.822 --> 51:27.980
Poor Centipede.

51:28.074 --> 51:30.946
He saved our lives down there.

51:31.036 --> 51:32.993
- Look out!
- Miss Spider!

51:36.500 --> 51:39.703
- Centipede!
- How am I lookin', kid?

51:39.794 --> 51:45.252
Oh, Centipede. I do not know
whether to kill you or kiss you.

51:47.093 --> 51:49.846
- Well, I-- Say, I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

51:49.931 --> 51:52.421
- My sincere apologies.
- I just, I just wanna apologize.

51:52.516 --> 51:54.592
- I just wanted to say--
- What I'm tryin' to say--

51:54.684 --> 51:56.926
That's enough chit-chat!
I'm freezing!

51:57.020 --> 51:59.097
Hello? The compass is ready.

51:59.189 --> 52:02.439
Mr Centipede, would you please
do us the honour...

52:02.525 --> 52:04.851
of navigating us
out of this icebox?

52:04.945 --> 52:07.103
It would be my pleasure.

52:07.198 --> 52:09.154
I believe our position
puts us very close to--

52:09.241 --> 52:12.693
I admire your bravery,
Miss Spider. I really do.

52:12.787 --> 52:15.538
Why, thank you, Mrs Ladybug.

52:15.623 --> 52:18.659
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.

52:24.256 --> 52:27.257
I'm looking forward
to a hopping good time...

52:27.342 --> 52:29.964
in the Big Apple, Mr Centipede.

52:30.054 --> 52:33.090
You said it, Mr Grasshopper.

52:41.232 --> 52:45.525
Oh, boy. What I wouldn't do
for a cup of coffee.

52:50.741 --> 52:53.659
Cup of joe.

52:53.744 --> 52:57.196
I say, old sport. Came to
relieve you of your duties.

52:57.290 --> 53:01.073
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.

53:02.461 --> 53:06.329
- Can't quit now.
- Good show, old boy.

53:10.595 --> 53:14.213
Thanks, Mr Grasshopper.

54:01.355 --> 54:04.806
- That music.
- Oh, Sir James! D-Did I disturb you?

54:04.900 --> 54:07.390
So sorry.
I-I-I-I'll put this away.

54:07.485 --> 54:09.395
No, no! I like it.

54:09.488 --> 54:13.402
I used to hear it at my aunts'
house before I went to sleep.

54:13.492 --> 54:15.448
That was you, wasn't it?

54:15.535 --> 54:17.611
Or do all grasshoppers play music?

54:17.704 --> 54:21.072
All grasshoppers try.

54:21.166 --> 54:23.124
I'm sure you've heard this.

54:27.422 --> 54:30.091
Ghastly, isn't it? Cricket stuff.

54:30.174 --> 54:34.587
- Music should be the voice of the soul.
- What does that mean?

54:34.679 --> 54:39.306
It means that when I'm happy,
my music sounds like this.

54:54.198 --> 54:57.532
And when I'm sad,
it's like this.

55:07.879 --> 55:12.376
When I was sad, I used to climb
in bed with my mum and dad.

55:12.468 --> 55:15.385
But that was a long time ago.

55:15.471 --> 55:18.591
I'm sure they'd be
very proud of you,James.

55:18.682 --> 55:21.220
I know we are.

55:31.612 --> 55:33.651
<i>Take a little time</i>

55:33.739 --> 55:35.981
<i>Just look at where we are</i>

55:36.075 --> 55:38.317
<i>We've come very, very far</i>

55:38.411 --> 55:40.736
<i>Together</i>

55:40.830 --> 55:42.988
<i>And if I might say so</i>

55:43.082 --> 55:45.656
<i>And if I might say so too</i>

55:45.752 --> 55:48.206
<i>We wouldn't have got anywhere</i>

55:48.295 --> 55:52.755
<i>If it weren't for you, boy</i>

55:52.841 --> 55:57.468
<i>Love is the sweetest thing</i>

55:57.555 --> 56:02.098
<i>Love never comes
just when you think it will</i>

56:02.184 --> 56:06.347
<i>Love is the way we feel for you</i>

56:06.438 --> 56:08.396
<i>We're family</i>

56:08.483 --> 56:10.772
<i>We're family</i>

56:10.859 --> 56:13.149
<i>- We're family
- All of us</i>

56:13.237 --> 56:15.395
<i>And you</i>

56:23.289 --> 56:25.495
<i>Think of where we'd be</i>

56:25.584 --> 56:28.156
<i>- If we were on our own
- We'd be dead.</i>

56:28.252 --> 56:32.499
<i>- You're what holds us all together
- I am?</i>

56:32.589 --> 56:34.749
<i>And if I might say so</i>

56:34.843 --> 56:37.547
<i>And if we might say so too</i>

56:37.636 --> 56:39.879
<i>We never could love anyone</i>

56:39.972 --> 56:43.056
<i>As much as we love you</i>

56:44.436 --> 56:49.144
<i>- Love
- Is the strangest thing</i>

56:49.232 --> 56:51.059
<i>Love</i>

56:51.150 --> 56:53.689
<i>Does exactly what
it wants to do</i>

56:53.778 --> 56:57.859
<i>- Love
- Boy, ya know it's true</i>

56:57.950 --> 56:59.858
<i>We're family</i>

56:59.950 --> 57:01.991
<i>We're family</i>

57:02.078 --> 57:06.705
<i>We're family
Me, me, me, me, me and you</i>

57:08.501 --> 57:10.411
<i>Ashes to ashes</i>

57:10.504 --> 57:13.076
<i>And dust to dust</i>

57:13.172 --> 57:18.843
<i>Without you
there'd be no "us''</i>

57:20.012 --> 57:24.425
<i>Love is the sweetest thing</i>

57:24.517 --> 57:28.931
<i>Love does exactly what
it wants to do</i>

57:29.021 --> 57:33.020
<i>Love is the way we feel for you</i>

57:33.109 --> 57:35.103
<i>We're family</i>

57:35.195 --> 57:37.567
<i>We're family</i>

57:37.656 --> 57:41.487
<i>We're family</i>

57:41.576 --> 57:43.285
<i>Me</i>

57:43.370 --> 57:47.119
<i>And you</i>

57:59.219 --> 58:01.508
We'll always be together, won't we?

58:01.597 --> 58:04.431
Kid, you're stuck
with us for life.

58:10.314 --> 58:12.852
Look, everybody. We made it!

58:12.941 --> 58:15.979
- We did?
- New York City.

58:16.070 --> 58:18.108
- Breathtaking!
- Stunning!

58:18.197 --> 58:20.236
- Oh, how glorious!
- Look at the park!

58:20.324 --> 58:22.815
- It's fabulous.
- We have made it!

58:22.909 --> 58:24.819
What a wonderful sight!

58:24.912 --> 58:27.285
There's Lady Liberty.

58:27.372 --> 58:30.124
I can almost smell
the lovely dirt.

58:30.209 --> 58:34.159
- Is it not beautiful?
- The Empire State Building!

58:34.255 --> 58:37.670
See those lights! Wa-hoo!

58:37.759 --> 58:40.593
Yippee! Attaboy, Jimmy!

58:40.678 --> 58:44.461
Good show,James!
The city awaits us.

58:44.556 --> 58:48.885
Now, remember,James. First
impression is very important.

59:01.531 --> 59:04.449
- Oh, no!
- We'll be blown off course!

59:04.535 --> 59:06.943
We'll wind up in Jersey!

59:12.042 --> 59:15.292
- Could it be--
- No. It couldn't be.

59:16.839 --> 59:21.085
- It's the rhino!
- Oh,James. Do something.

59:25.806 --> 59:28.972
Everyone, climb up
into the rigging!

59:29.060 --> 59:30.969
Hurry!

59:33.149 --> 59:36.766
James, are you not
coming with us?

59:36.860 --> 59:40.228
No! It got
my mum and dad.

59:40.321 --> 59:43.524
It won't get my friends!

59:43.617 --> 59:46.867
Come out and show your face,
you stupid beast!

59:54.794 --> 59:57.332
Good God Almighty!

01:00:00.008 --> 01:00:03.840
Remember what
your parents said,James:

01:00:03.929 --> 01:00:08.508
"Try looking at it another way.''

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.933
You're not even a real rhino!

01:00:12.019 --> 01:00:16.018
You're just a lot
of smoke and noise!

01:00:16.107 --> 01:00:18.479
I'm not afraid of you!

01:00:27.202 --> 01:00:33.039
I'm not afraid of you!

01:00:44.302 --> 01:00:47.137
James!

01:00:47.222 --> 01:00:50.176
No!

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.047
Miss Spider? Mr Grasshopper?

01:01:29.098 --> 01:01:31.671
Hello? Is anyone there?

01:02:09.013 --> 01:02:11.053
This isn't right.

01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:13.976
Where's the Empire State Building?

01:02:36.207 --> 01:02:38.366
What in the--

01:02:41.588 --> 01:02:45.371
Officer! There's a boy up there!

01:02:47.093 --> 01:02:49.002
What? A boy?

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.269
Mabel, we got us a huge,
unidentified object here.

01:02:57.353 --> 01:03:00.023
<i>- What's it look like?
- Round, fuzzy.</i>

01:03:00.106 --> 01:03:02.679
<i>- It looks sorta like
a giant fruit or something.
- Well, what is it?</i>

01:03:02.775 --> 01:03:07.236
I don't know what it is!Just send us
the biggest crane in New York!

01:03:24.381 --> 01:03:27.631
Please, sir. How do I get
to the Empire State Building?

01:03:27.718 --> 01:03:30.125
You're on top of it, kid.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.177
We made it!

01:03:35.933 --> 01:03:38.176
Well, I made it.

01:03:42.232 --> 01:03:44.141
Hang on.

01:03:50.575 --> 01:03:52.566
Have you seen
any big bugs tonight?

01:03:52.658 --> 01:03:54.984
Big bugs? How big?

01:04:01.085 --> 01:04:03.657
I hope they're all right.

01:04:21.939 --> 01:04:23.849
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.

01:04:31.281 --> 01:04:33.855
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.

01:04:33.951 --> 01:04:36.240
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid, now. I got ya.

01:04:37.121 --> 01:04:39.528
Stay away from the fruit!

01:04:39.624 --> 01:04:42.624
- Who's that? Hey!
- What is this thing?

01:04:42.709 --> 01:04:44.335
- Where you from?
- Why you here?
- Who?
- What?

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.041
- Where?
- When?
- Hold your fire, fellas!

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.704
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here. I got you now.

01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:54.420
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's going to hurt ya.

01:04:54.513 --> 01:04:56.636
Move back for them.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.329
No.

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.766
Hello,

01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:51.773
little angel.

01:05:51.863 --> 01:05:55.694
So kind of you to look after
our little lost lamb.

01:05:57.535 --> 01:06:00.952
- Who are you?
- We are the boy's legal guardians.

01:06:01.039 --> 01:06:03.956
And we've missed him so much.

01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:05.952
So we'll just take him home now.

01:06:06.043 --> 01:06:08.879
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.

01:06:08.963 --> 01:06:11.537
Well, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Back up.

01:06:11.633 --> 01:06:15.297
You mean to tell me that
this thing is a peach?

01:06:15.386 --> 01:06:18.637
- It's not " a peach.'' It's our peach.
- Our peach.

01:06:18.723 --> 01:06:20.681
- Show him, Spongy.
- Yes.

01:06:31.235 --> 01:06:33.276
-Looks like it's their peach, all right.
-Yes.

01:06:33.363 --> 01:06:37.028
- Yes, and we're very proud of it.
- We're going to be in the record books.

01:06:37.116 --> 01:06:40.154
It's not their peach.
The old man gave the green things to me.

01:06:40.244 --> 01:06:44.160
- That's what made it grow.
- How dare you disagree with us!

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:50.003
Patience, sister.
Remember his condition.

01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:52.496
- His condition?
- He's a chronic liar.

01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:55.508
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:58.050
Well, that's why we're here;
to bring him home.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:01.507
So you come here with us,
eh, lovey!

01:07:03.727 --> 01:07:05.850
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!

01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:10.599
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent
that you release him to us immediately.

01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:12.685
Let the boy speak!

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:15.021
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Let the boy speak!

01:07:17.407 --> 01:07:21.275
All right! All right! All right!
Let's get to the bottom of this.

01:07:21.369 --> 01:07:24.455
This thing is a peach.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.532
All right. I'll buy that.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:29.377
Now, does somebody want
to tell me how it got here?

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.668
We attached it
to a hundred seagulls.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:34.211
Seagulls?

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.758
That's what happened!

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:39.461
Me and Miss Spider and the centipede
and the old green grasshopper.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:42.391
I think he's gone mad.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:45.012
This is all something he dreamed up.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:52.477
Well, maybe it started that way,
as a dream, but doesn't everything?

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:56.898
Those buildings, these lights,
this whole city!

01:07:56.989 --> 01:08:01.117
Somebody had to dream about it first,
and maybe that's what I did.

01:08:01.201 --> 01:08:03.990
I dreamed about coming here,
but then I did it.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.080
- The poor boy needs his medicine.
- Yes.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:10.285
- So we'll just take him--
- And the peach.

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:13.877
back to our cosy, little house
on the hill.

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:16.752
Come along.
You're going home with us.

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:18.881
No, I'm not.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:21.881
What did you say?

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:26.599
I said, "No, I'm not!''

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:30.765
I hate that house and that cold room
and how I was always hungry.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.765
All right! That's enough!

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:37.354
- And how you beat me!
- He's lying!

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.282
- And told me I was nothing!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:43.035
- Shut up!
- No! Not this time.

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:47.540
I flew the giant peach
across the ocean.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:51.207
I landed on top of the
tallest building in the world.

01:08:51.295 --> 01:08:54.877
I made it! I'm not the one
who's nothing. You are!

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:59.093
And I'm never going back with you!
Not me, and not the peach.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.715
How dare you speak to us this way?

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.939
James! Up here!

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:20.029
Hello! We're here!

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:23.069
- Hey, buddy!
- What are they?

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.944
- Young James.
- Hey,Jimmy!

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:31.286
- Bugs!
- Need a little help down there?

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:33.747
Giant bugs!

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:37.834
Hey, you old biddies!

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:40.046
- Help us!
- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:42.175
Hello,James!

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.254
I told you they were real.

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:48.475
- Hello, old boy.
- Requesting clearance to land.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.853
Miss Spider, throw me a string.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.279
Okay. Pull them up.

01:10:08.373 --> 01:10:10.281
Help!

01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:14.791
Where are we going?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.798
- Spin them around.
- You little--

01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:24.675
Wrap them tightly!

01:10:31.562 --> 01:10:35.061
Tighter! Tighter!

01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:37.438
Well, I'll be a--

01:10:37.527 --> 01:10:39.483
The kid was tellin' the truth.

01:10:42.156 --> 01:10:45.904
Get those two creeps outta here!

01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:58.703
Stop the presses!
I got a new front page!

01:10:58.799 --> 01:11:01.123
"Big Bugs In The Big Apple.''

01:11:01.217 --> 01:11:05.084
In big, bold print: " A Little
Lindy Flies Giant Peach.''

01:11:05.179 --> 01:11:08.963
"Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach-Pit Pals.''

01:11:11.561 --> 01:11:14.561
Everyone, these are my friends;

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.605
the ones I've been telling you about.

01:11:16.691 --> 01:11:18.979
- Mr Centipede.
- Hi.

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:21.108
- Old green grasshopper.
- My pleasure.

01:11:21.196 --> 01:11:24.280
- Earthworm. Mrs Ladybug.
- Charmed.

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:27.485
Miss Spider. And the glow-worm.

01:11:27.577 --> 01:11:29.701
God bless the colonies.

01:11:30.246 --> 01:11:34.790
- Could we eat some of your peach?
- It won't keep forever.

01:11:34.876 --> 01:11:36.785
Go ahead.

01:11:46.721 --> 01:11:49.295
Hey! What was your name?

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:51.347
It's James.

01:11:59.608 --> 01:12:03.772
They ate that peach
all the way down to the pit...

01:12:05.782 --> 01:12:09.649
and set it up in Central Park
as a permanent home.

01:12:11.412 --> 01:12:13.986
And James Henry Trotter,

01:12:14.082 --> 01:12:17.664
who once was the saddest and loneliest
little boy you could find,

01:12:17.752 --> 01:12:20.836
now had a loving new family...

01:12:20.921 --> 01:12:23.460
and all the friends in the world.

01:12:23.549 --> 01:12:26.219
James, dinner is ready.

01:12:26.303 --> 01:12:28.675
All right. Nearly finished.

01:12:33.101 --> 01:12:37.016
And since James's visitors
begged him again and again...

01:12:37.106 --> 01:12:40.390
to hear the story of his
adventure with the giant peach,

01:12:40.483 --> 01:12:43.320
he wished for a way
to share it with everyone.

01:12:45.363 --> 01:12:50.109
And that is exactly
what you have just seen.

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:09.458
<i>Once upon a time
there was a vulture and a hog</i>

01:13:09.554 --> 01:13:12.888
<i>Livin' in a house
up on a hill</i>

01:13:12.975 --> 01:13:17.387
<i>Had this little boy who lived with them
They worked him like a dog</i>

01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:20.764
<i>With any luck
they'd have him up there still</i>

01:13:20.857 --> 01:13:24.901
<i>'Long came a magic man
with a magic bag</i>

01:13:24.986 --> 01:13:28.901
<i>Full of nasty little
green things in a funky old rag</i>

01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:32.906
<i>He said, Boy, you may not know it
but this here's salvation you see</i>

01:13:32.995 --> 01:13:35.746
<i>Son, you're going down in history</i>

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:41.999
<i>Good news is blowin' in your window</i>

01:13:43.714 --> 01:13:46.335
<i>Good news is knockin' on your door</i>

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:50.209
<i>Good news is comin' 'round the corner</i>

01:13:51.763 --> 01:13:54.005
<i>Good news is rollin' 'round your floor</i>

01:13:55.726 --> 01:13:59.677
<i>Where can all my troubles be</i>

01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:03.687
<i>Must be good news chasin' me</i>

01:14:03.776 --> 01:14:07.109
<i>Good enough to set everybody free</i>

01:14:07.196 --> 01:14:11.360
<i>Good news, good news, good news</i>

01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:13.195
<i>Good news</i>

01:14:13.286 --> 01:14:17.366
<i>There were bugs in the garden
Didn't have a clue</i>

01:14:17.457 --> 01:14:21.157
<i>But every day
their life was on the line</i>

01:14:21.252 --> 01:14:25.296
<i>They wanted to get out of there
but they didn't know what to do</i>

01:14:25.381 --> 01:14:28.465
<i>Their little brains
was workin' overtime</i>

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:33.712
<i>- Well
- That all changed one sunny day</i>

01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:37.341
<i>That little boy dropped by to say</i>

01:14:37.434 --> 01:14:40.971
<i>If we all work together
we'll make out okay</i>

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:45.275
<i>- We will
- Good news, good news, good news</i>

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.404
<i>So they rolled down the mountain
flew over the sea</i>

01:14:49.489 --> 01:14:53.155
<i>Facin' death and danger on their way</i>

01:14:53.243 --> 01:14:55.317
<i>But together they have made it</i>

01:14:55.411 --> 01:14:57.321
<i>They're where they want to be</i>

01:14:57.413 --> 01:15:00.082
<i>They love each other
more and more each day</i>

01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:03.751
<i>They care about each other</i>

01:15:03.837 --> 01:15:06.078
<i>Good news is sweepin'
'cross the country</i>

01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:10.006
<i>Good news is spreadin' all around</i>

01:15:11.804 --> 01:15:14.091
<i>Good news is hittin' in the city</i>

01:15:15.765 --> 01:15:18.257
<i>Good news has sprung up in the town</i>

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:23.719
<i>The things that used to hurt before</i>

01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:27.682
<i>They don't hurt 'em any more</i>

01:15:27.777 --> 01:15:31.111
<i>'Cause they know there's
somethin' good in store</i>
