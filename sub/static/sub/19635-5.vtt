00:01.000 --> 00:02.758
<i>Previously on Broadchurch...</i>

00:02.759 --> 00:05.038
Saturday morning, day of the party,

00:05.039 --> 00:08.559
Trish and me,
we were in bed together.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.360
She's my best friend.
If she ever finds out, I'll...

00:12.400 --> 00:15.359
- Is, uh, Daisy in?
- Who are you?

00:15.360 --> 00:17.158
Just tell her the boys came round.

00:17.159 --> 00:20.159
I heard what happened. I thought
maybe you'd need a friend.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.038
What did you find out?

00:23.039 --> 00:24.719
I've got
everything you asked for.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.758
I've found Joe.
Time to put things right.

00:26.759 --> 00:28.238
- We did that.
- We bloody didn't!

00:28.239 --> 00:30.038
Yes, we did!
Enough of this shit, Mark!

00:30.039 --> 00:31.878
I am Danny's dad - I'm not gonna stop

00:31.879 --> 00:33.838
until I know I've done right by him.

00:33.839 --> 00:36.118
Aaron Mayford - three years

00:36.119 --> 00:38.518
for the rape of a woman
at a budget hotel.

00:38.519 --> 00:42.279
His victim was tied and
gagged, just like Trish.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.878
Two years ago,
in a field, walking home.

00:44.879 --> 00:48.158
He tied me up, put a gag in my mouth.

00:48.159 --> 00:52.600
I was raped and I never told anyone.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:11.680 --> 01:16.599
My name is Laura Benson. I live
at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.919
Why have you come
to the station today, Laura?

01:19.920 --> 01:23.158
I read about the woman who was raped.

01:23.159 --> 01:26.800
It happened to me too.
I was raped.

01:26.839 --> 01:28.479
And when was this?

01:29.839 --> 01:33.359
Two years ago... almost.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.799
June 2. It was a Saturday.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.719
Do you know who the person was
that did this to you?

01:38.720 --> 01:41.478
No. I still don't.

01:41.479 --> 01:44.119
And where... where did the attack happen?

01:45.560 --> 01:50.679
I was walking home from the pub,
the Rising Sun in Abbots Chapel.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.639
Been a big do, place was packed.
They had music, late lock-in.

01:57.839 --> 02:00.359
The last of us left
around half three.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.559
And when you left the pub, did
you leave alone, or with others?

02:04.560 --> 02:06.359
Alone.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.239
What happened when you left the pub?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.158
I wasn't far from home.

02:17.159 --> 02:18.878
There's a field you cross diagonally -

02:18.879 --> 02:20.478
it's just long grass, never got mowed -

02:20.479 --> 02:22.560
takes you into the back of Kingsbere.

02:26.039 --> 02:27.958
I was right in the middle of it

02:27.959 --> 02:30.038
when I thought I heard something.

02:30.039 --> 02:32.359
I was about to look
behind me, I dunno why,

02:32.360 --> 02:35.638
I could just sense
someone running at me.

02:35.639 --> 02:37.679
I think he punched me.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.279
I got hit from behind.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.519
Just knocked me right out.

02:43.879 --> 02:45.879
Do you have any idea how long

02:45.920 --> 02:48.279
you were knocked out
before you came round?

02:48.280 --> 02:50.039
No.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.118
When I came round, there was
something in my mouth.

02:55.119 --> 02:58.479
It was like thick
material, gagging me.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.000
My hands were tied behind
my back and he was on top of me.

03:04.959 --> 03:06.799
He smelt of drink.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.638
What sort of drink?

03:08.639 --> 03:14.039
Spirits. I don't know why
I remember that. Cheap spirits.

03:14.079 --> 03:16.719
Are you able to describe him to us?

03:16.720 --> 03:19.958
I-I don't know. I couldn't
see him. I'm sorry.

03:19.959 --> 03:22.119
It's alright, you're doing really well.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.919
What did you do with your
clothes from that night, Laura?

03:29.920 --> 03:33.279
I washed them.
Never wore them again.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.280
Have you still got them?

03:37.600 --> 03:41.479
And did you speak to anyone
about the attack at the time?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.679
My GP. A week or two after.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.280
She told me I should report it.
I told her I didn't want to.

03:50.839 --> 03:54.720
I didn't tell anyone... till now.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.878
Why didn't you want
to report this at the time?

03:58.879 --> 04:01.199
I know what happens.
I read the papers.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.199
I'd had a lot to drink.
I mean, a lot.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.199
Plus, short skirt, nice top, make-up.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.400
You think I don't know
what they'd do to me?

04:11.839 --> 04:13.878
I know how women like me get treated.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.639
Not by us.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.600
What made you change your mind today?

04:22.519 --> 04:27.279
I read it in the papers and I
was sick in the toilets at work.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.680
I just thought, "What if it's him?"

04:31.720 --> 04:34.638
"What if it's the same man?"

04:34.639 --> 04:39.438
"I didn't report it, and
he's done it to someone else."

04:39.439 --> 04:44.400
"I could've stopped it...
if I'd been braver."

04:46.400 --> 04:50.039
"I know what she's going
through and it's my fault."

05:19.360 --> 05:20.919
Thank you.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.318
You were very brave

05:22.319 --> 05:24.158
coming to see us today, Laura.

05:24.159 --> 05:27.039
I don't know how you've kept it
to yourself for so long.

05:27.079 --> 05:28.919
You're doing the right thing now.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.478
I want you to know,

05:30.479 --> 05:32.279
it doesn't matter
how long ago this was.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.078
We'll investigate this as thoroughly

05:34.079 --> 05:35.838
and robustly as we can.

05:35.839 --> 05:37.518
We'll do everything we can

05:37.519 --> 05:39.920
to find the person
that did this to you.

05:39.959 --> 05:43.199
We'll keep you fully up-to-date
with what happens now, OK?

05:43.200 --> 05:47.038
But you will need support.
Have you got anyone to talk to?

05:47.039 --> 05:49.400
I got married six weeks ago.

05:51.439 --> 05:53.679
He doesn't know.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.159
Do I tell him?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.279
There's no way
she could have known

06:04.280 --> 06:06.279
the details of what happened to Trish.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.038
No, we haven't released them and
Trish has told nobody but us.

06:10.039 --> 06:13.078
Which means this could
be the same attacker.

06:13.079 --> 06:16.159
And Trish isn't his first victim.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.518
She didn't report it 'cause she thought

06:21.519 --> 06:23.599
she wouldn't be treated
with respect or dignity.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
Well, then we prove to her
that she will and we catch him

06:26.639 --> 06:30.200
and we make sure he goes away
for a very, very long time.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.079
Is that him?

06:41.439 --> 06:43.359
Yeah, looks like it.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.359
Oh, Mum, I'm not sure
why you agreed to this.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.638
He asked.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.158
Can you be sure that

06:50.159 --> 06:52.238
it definitely wasn't him
who attacked you?

06:52.239 --> 06:53.919
We're just talking.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.238
You don't have to do anything,
unless there's any trouble.

06:56.239 --> 06:58.600
But if you think
there might be trouble...

07:19.839 --> 07:22.518
What was that, security?

07:22.519 --> 07:24.519
Just looking out for me.

07:27.159 --> 07:30.360
Does she know? About us?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.639
She'll be figuring something's up.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.999
It weren't me, Trish.
I didn't do it.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.319
You know that, don't you?

07:52.519 --> 07:56.679
Well, you must know that.
I mean, well, why would I?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.759
What?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.599
Police came to see me.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.400
They know about us,
about Saturday morning.

08:07.439 --> 08:09.078
Yeah.

08:09.079 --> 08:12.039
Bloody hell, Trish. This is
some kind of mess now, innit?

08:13.839 --> 08:16.919
I just think Cath doesn't need to know.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.838
Right. That's what you think, is it?

08:19.839 --> 08:22.679
Well, what good's it gonna do?

08:22.680 --> 08:24.559
We owe her the truth.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.238
Do we? Really?
How's that gonna help?

08:27.239 --> 08:29.359
I'll tell her it was a mistake.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.438
Oh, great. Like that's gonna
make all the difference.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.198
You tell her, I'm gonna
have to pack my bags.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.799
- Might not be like that.
- Course it bloody will.

08:41.799 --> 08:45.519
She's gonna find out, Jim.
It might as well be from me.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.680
You have no idea what
you're letting yourself in for.

09:07.519 --> 09:09.199
So Aaron Mayford...

09:09.200 --> 09:12.478
- How was the surveillance?
- Yeah, uh, it was fine.

09:12.479 --> 09:14.200
Doesn't look like it from your face.

09:14.239 --> 09:16.478
Alright, not fine -
Steve was off getting food,

09:16.479 --> 09:18.318
and Mayford got in the car with me.

09:18.319 --> 09:20.478
- What?!
- Look, the point is...

09:20.479 --> 09:22.919
I think we found something
in his work history.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.599
Go on.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.999
So the company that Mayford
worked for as an IT consultant

09:27.000 --> 09:28.878
had contracts with Flintcombe Farm Shop

09:28.879 --> 09:30.438
and Coopers Telemarketing,
which is where

09:30.439 --> 09:32.958
this new woman, Laura Benson, works.

09:32.959 --> 09:35.159
He has a connection with both women.

09:37.479 --> 09:39.479
Let me do this one.

09:47.159 --> 09:48.838
- Yeah?
- Hi, Aaron.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.359
We'd like you to come to the
station, answer some questions.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.559
- Who is it? Who is it?
- Get back inside.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.239
- What for?
- Back!

09:58.879 --> 10:00.719
I don't wanna come.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.999
Aaron Mayford, I'm arresting you

10:03.000 --> 10:05.118
in connection with
an incident of sexual assault

10:05.119 --> 10:07.279
on 28 May in the Axehampton area.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.279
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

10:10.280 --> 10:12.038
if you do not mention when questioned

10:12.039 --> 10:13.759
something you later rely on in court.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.360
Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Understand?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.000
Yeah.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.199
Bit lazy, though, isn't it?

10:42.200 --> 10:47.599
You know, woman gets raped,
you pull in the local rapist,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.758
even if you don't know
the full facts of his story.

10:50.759 --> 10:53.719
We need blood, urine,
pubic hair and penile swabs too.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.279
We'll need your written consent.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.638
And if I don't give you my consent?

10:57.639 --> 10:59.199
Any future jury could take

10:59.200 --> 11:01.280
a negative inference if you refuse.

11:03.119 --> 11:04.999
Aaron, can you clarify for us

11:05.000 --> 11:07.158
where you were this past Saturday night,

11:07.159 --> 11:11.118
between approximately 10pm and 5am.

11:11.119 --> 11:13.078
I was fishing.

11:13.079 --> 11:15.279
- Where were you fishing?
- Off the beach.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.200
- Which beach?
- The one next to the sea.

11:19.759 --> 11:23.238
Between the caravan park
and the cafe at Bartons End.

11:23.239 --> 11:25.878
Were you anywhere near
Axehampton on Saturday night?

11:25.879 --> 11:27.999
- No.
- Or the party

11:28.000 --> 11:29.999
that was going on at Axehampton House?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.679
As I wasn't in Axehampton,

11:31.680 --> 11:33.878
I wouldn't have been
near the house, would I?

11:33.879 --> 11:37.199
You drove
your own car to go fishing?

11:37.200 --> 11:40.078
- Yep.
- What route did you take?

11:40.079 --> 11:42.518
Same as usual -
out on the St Andrews Road,

11:42.519 --> 11:45.399
onto the coast road,
down to the car park.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.599
- Same on the way back?
- Same on the way back.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.158
- Well, that makes sense.
- Glad you're happy.

11:50.159 --> 11:53.158
Except you didn't.

11:53.159 --> 11:55.638
Either way.

11:55.639 --> 11:57.599
We've checked the CCTV.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.679
Your car didn't go that
route in either direction,

11:59.680 --> 12:04.038
any time between Saturday
afternoon and Sunday afternoon.

12:04.039 --> 12:06.679
You must've missed me.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.000
We're pretty thorough.

12:10.319 --> 12:12.078
You said there were other men

12:12.079 --> 12:13.799
fishing off the beach on Saturday.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.518
- What were their names?
- No idea.

12:15.519 --> 12:17.238
Don't you ever talk to them?

12:17.239 --> 12:19.799
I don't go to the
beach at night to talk.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.318
I go to be alone.

12:21.319 --> 12:23.359
- You like being alone, Aaron?
- Yeah.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.799
- Find people annoying?
- No.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.199
- I find this annoying.
- Right.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.518
What about this is annoying to you?

12:31.519 --> 12:34.359
Being victimised again for something

12:34.360 --> 12:36.758
I didn't even do in the first place.

12:36.759 --> 12:38.999
What did you catch?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.599
What?

12:40.600 --> 12:43.279
- What fish did you catch?
- Mackerel.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.158
- How many?
- Dozen or so.

12:47.159 --> 12:50.238
It's not difficult.
You could probably do it.

12:50.239 --> 12:52.518
- What did you do with them?
- What?

12:52.519 --> 12:55.559
What did you do with the
mackerel after you caught them?

12:55.560 --> 12:57.878
Put it in the cooler.

12:57.879 --> 12:59.919
Brought it home
at the end of the night.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.720
- What did you do with them then?
- I ate them, the next day.

13:06.039 --> 13:08.238
- Who cooks them?
- Me.

13:08.239 --> 13:10.038
You ate all of them the next day?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.958
There were a dozen.
So we had about six or seven.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.838
What did you do with the others?

13:14.839 --> 13:17.038
Froze them. Why, do you want a couple?

13:17.039 --> 13:18.919
No.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.799
So if we were to go to your house now,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.958
your wife would confirm and back up

13:23.959 --> 13:26.199
that you cooked her
fresh mackerel on Sunday?

13:26.200 --> 13:27.559
Yep.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.719
And if we were to look in your freezer,

13:29.720 --> 13:32.360
we'd find the remainder
of the mackerel in there?

13:33.920 --> 13:36.639
That's if she hasn't been
at them while I've been here.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.638
Have you ever been to Abbots Chapel?

13:41.639 --> 13:45.799
- Oh, she speaks.
- Answer the question, please.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.599
Dunno.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.319
- Do you know the village I mean?
- Yes.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.518
Do you know
the Rising Sun pub there?

13:55.519 --> 13:57.399
I don't think so.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.720
- Never been in there?
- Should I have?

14:00.759 --> 14:04.359
- It's a yes/no question.
- No.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.118
What about Kingsbere?
You ever been to Kingsbere?

14:07.119 --> 14:09.799
Are you just gonna run through
a list of local places?

14:09.800 --> 14:11.679
Answer the question, Aaron, please.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.438
Have you ever been to Kingsbere?

14:13.439 --> 14:16.159
- Yes.
- When?

14:18.079 --> 14:20.039
I had a mate who lived there.

14:20.079 --> 14:22.478
We played football
together a few times.

14:22.479 --> 14:24.000
Name?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.518
Dave King.

14:27.519 --> 14:30.518
- Does he still live there?
- Dunno. We fell out of touch.

14:30.519 --> 14:33.078
It's amazing what happens
when you go to prison.

14:33.079 --> 14:35.360
Your social life falls apart.

14:38.159 --> 14:41.078
Wait, Abbots Chapel is, um...

14:41.079 --> 14:42.958
Abbots Chapel is the next
village over, right?

14:42.959 --> 14:45.038
Well, we used to drink in a pub there.

14:45.039 --> 14:48.199
So if that's the Rising Sun, then, yes.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.359
But not recently?

14:51.360 --> 14:52.758
No.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.919
- Few years back?
- Yeah.

14:56.920 --> 15:01.318
- 2013? 2014?
- Bit before, probably.

15:01.319 --> 15:04.118
Ever been to Flintcombe Farm Shop?

15:04.119 --> 15:07.158
Yes. I used to do the IT support.

15:07.159 --> 15:10.038
The company I worked
for had the contract.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.559
- Who'd you deal with there?
- The owner.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.238
Um... What was his name? Ed?

15:16.239 --> 15:18.399
Meet any of the other staff there?

15:18.400 --> 15:21.199
No.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.438
And you did some work for
Coopers Telemarketing?

15:24.439 --> 15:28.638
Yeah. Yeah, their system
was a right old mess.

15:28.639 --> 15:32.639
And was it Laura Benson
in charge of their IT contract?

15:35.039 --> 15:40.119
No. It was a bloke. Terry somebody.

15:40.159 --> 15:42.359
You didn't have anything
to do with Laura Benson?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.319
I've never met Laura Benson.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.038
Do you want the bacon
in the fridge or the freezer?

15:55.039 --> 15:56.638
'Cause there's quite a lot of it.

15:56.639 --> 15:58.478
You really didn't have to do all this.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.399
It's not me, is it? It's Ed.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.238
He wouldn't let me come here
without half the shop.

16:03.239 --> 16:06.559
I just find it quite hard
that everyone seems to know now.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.158
Hey, nobody's judging you.

16:08.159 --> 16:10.439
Why would they be judging me?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.399
Well, no, that's what I'm saying.
They're not judging you.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.319
You know, we're all here for you.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.759
Cath, I-I need to
talk to you about something.

16:23.239 --> 16:26.158
About the attack?
Is it about what he did to you?

16:26.159 --> 16:28.078
Because you know
you can tell me anything.

16:28.079 --> 16:29.799
I'm not gonna tell anyone, I promise.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.439
- I'm your mate so...
- No.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.360
Me and Jim, we had sex.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.319
Saturday morning.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.119
What?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.518
No.

16:50.519 --> 16:52.318
Trish...

16:52.319 --> 16:55.279
We did and I'm sorry,
and it shouldn't have happened.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.199
- If I could take it back, I...
- Wait, wait. Just shut up.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.079
Just shut up. Shut up, Trish.
Just... just stop talking now.

17:06.638 --> 17:08.400
It was you?

17:12.200 --> 17:15.199
Yeah, you see, I-I, um...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.518
I thought there was someone
on Saturday morning,

17:17.519 --> 17:19.358
and I gave myself
a talking-to, you know,

17:19.359 --> 17:22.238
"Not on the day of your party.
Give the man a break."

17:22.239 --> 17:23.560
But you?

17:25.759 --> 17:27.319
Really?!

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
You?

17:33.159 --> 17:35.280
Christ, his standards have slipped.

17:39.439 --> 17:41.238
So, um...

17:41.239 --> 17:44.038
- Was it here, was it?
- Yeah.

17:44.039 --> 17:46.158
Jesus.

17:46.159 --> 17:48.719
I never knew the smell
of mildew turned him on.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.438
I'm sorry.

17:50.439 --> 17:53.238
Why did you do it then
if you're so bloody sorry?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.719
He'd come round
to look at the boiler.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.199
Well, he certainly
did that, didn't he?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.118
- It wasn't planned.
- No, no.

18:00.119 --> 18:02.238
It's never planned with Jim, never is.

18:02.239 --> 18:04.638
But he's always ready
when called upon.

18:04.639 --> 18:07.158
I mean, you know you're
not the first, don't you?

18:07.159 --> 18:10.559
You're not even the fifth.
Of course you know that.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.719
Of course you know that
because we've talked about this,

18:12.720 --> 18:14.399
I've told you this - I, uh...

18:14.400 --> 18:17.199
- I let you into my confidence.
- I know, and I'm sorry...

18:17.200 --> 18:19.680
If you say sorry
one more fucking time...

18:23.600 --> 18:25.559
Um, so...

18:25.560 --> 18:28.039
Do you love him?

18:29.360 --> 18:32.360
- Don't be daft.
- Oh, is that daft?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.238
Oh, I'm so sorry
if that's daft, Trish.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.279
Only I married him and he's my husband

18:37.280 --> 18:39.158
and I think it's
a fair question to ask

18:39.159 --> 18:42.159
the woman who had sex with him
more recently than I have.

18:46.039 --> 18:49.878
Does he, um...
Does he know you're telling me?

18:49.879 --> 18:52.279
- Yeah.
- Oh, Christ!

18:52.280 --> 18:56.078
So you've plan... You've
met him, you have talked...

18:56.079 --> 18:58.559
Since then, you have met my husband

18:58.560 --> 19:00.400
and you have planned this.

19:01.759 --> 19:04.799
God, this is so Jim -
you're the one who gets raped

19:04.800 --> 19:07.999
and you're the one who has to tell me.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.399
Yeah, well, welcome
to my world, sweetheart.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.078
I mean, God forbid he should
ever clear up his own mess.

19:13.079 --> 19:15.679
The police found out.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.478
It was all to do with... DNA traces.

19:19.479 --> 19:22.438
I thought I owed it you
to tell you because we're mates.

19:22.439 --> 19:25.158
Oh, no, no, no, my love.
No, we're not mates.

19:25.159 --> 19:28.399
No, we just know each other.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.959
Alright.

19:33.079 --> 19:35.400
Here's what I don't understand.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.759
Of all the women at that party,

19:40.800 --> 19:43.119
why would somebody rape you?

19:46.079 --> 19:49.200
Don't make sense.

19:55.639 --> 19:57.280
Get out.

20:33.119 --> 20:36.679
- Cath.
- Don't come home tonight.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.119
- Just let me explain.
- No, I don't care, Jim.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.758
It was a spur-of-the-moment,
stupid mistake.

20:45.759 --> 20:48.238
I... I felt sorry for her, she...

20:48.239 --> 20:52.078
What, so it was
a pity fuck, was it?

20:52.079 --> 20:55.279
- Did you tell her that?
- No.

20:55.280 --> 20:59.638
Do you know
what your weakness is, love?

20:59.639 --> 21:02.118
No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

21:02.119 --> 21:07.200
You're stupid but
you think you're smart.

21:08.839 --> 21:10.759
That's a very dangerous place to live.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.800
I could set fire to your
life whenever I choose.

21:18.239 --> 21:22.000
If I were you, I'd be shitting
myself right now.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.199
Yeah, I just wanted to

21:28.200 --> 21:30.118
check in with you about Trish Winterman,

21:30.119 --> 21:31.758
see how you're doing.

21:31.759 --> 21:34.039
Alright. I think.

21:34.079 --> 21:36.919
How do you classify 'alright'?

21:36.920 --> 21:40.118
Uh, I think we have a good relationship.

21:40.119 --> 21:43.199
She seems to trust me.
We're in regular contact.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.878
Is something bothering you about it?

21:45.879 --> 21:47.958
Nothing. It's all fine.

21:47.959 --> 21:51.319
No, something's not right. What is it?

21:53.119 --> 21:55.799
Beth, the point of these supervisions

21:55.800 --> 21:57.399
is that you're honest with me.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.599
I've been where you are,
but I can't help you

21:59.600 --> 22:01.400
unless you tell me what's going on.

22:03.039 --> 22:04.838
She asked me to go along with her

22:04.839 --> 22:06.999
for her ABE interview with the police

22:07.000 --> 22:08.838
when she gave them her full statement.

22:08.839 --> 22:10.039
OK.

22:11.879 --> 22:14.518
It was pretty harrowing.

22:14.519 --> 22:18.878
Just... the detail
of what happened to her,

22:18.879 --> 22:21.319
what he did.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.958
I lie awake thinking about it,

22:23.959 --> 22:27.878
thinking, "Who would do
that sort of thing?"

22:27.879 --> 22:30.518
He knocked her out,

22:30.519 --> 22:33.878
tied her hands behind
her back and gagged her.

22:33.879 --> 22:37.238
I can't get it out of my mind.

22:37.239 --> 22:40.038
Right.

22:40.039 --> 22:42.318
Is that normal?

22:42.319 --> 22:46.038
Uh, it's totally normal,
totally understandable.

22:46.039 --> 22:49.200
Sorry, can you just say that all again?

22:53.079 --> 22:55.038
So this is what we found

22:55.039 --> 22:57.038
in Aaron Mayford's house and car,

22:57.039 --> 22:58.878
along with a very unhappy wife.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.959
First and foremost,
he's lying about Saturday night.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.799
No mackerel in the fridge or freezer.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.359
His wife doesn't like them, they
never have them in the house.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.559
Why would he lie about that? He
must know he'll get found out.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.638
Doesn't exactly present like
an innocent man, does he?

23:11.639 --> 23:14.560
Just 'cause he's an arsehole
doesn't mean he's a rapist.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.478
No, but these are a match

23:18.479 --> 23:20.679
to the condom wrapper
found at Axehampton.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.438
Yeah?

23:22.439 --> 23:25.719
How's he off for blue
fishing twine, Miller?

23:25.720 --> 23:27.318
Beth Latimer's downstairs

23:27.319 --> 23:29.519
saying she needs
an urgent word with you.

23:31.879 --> 23:34.118
I was having a supervision earlier,

23:34.119 --> 23:36.038
and we were discussing
Trish's case.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.199
Yeah, we had a client
about 11 months ago

23:38.200 --> 23:40.679
who disclosed to us but
never took it to the police,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.919
and it sounds very similar to
the attack on Trish Winterman.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.478
What was the woman's name?

23:45.479 --> 23:48.038
I can't say that at the moment -
client confidentiality.

23:48.039 --> 23:50.199
She wouldn't disclose
to the police at the time

23:50.200 --> 23:52.958
but I could get in touch with
her, see if she would now.

23:52.959 --> 23:56.559
- Where did the attack happen?
- On the way out of Budmouth.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.279
She was on her way
home after a party.

23:59.280 --> 24:04.478
She was knocked out, gagged with
an old sock, tied up, raped.

24:04.479 --> 24:07.400
Like I say, she never reported it.

24:11.039 --> 24:14.238
Three women, all attacked
by an unknown assailant,

24:14.239 --> 24:16.238
all after some sort
of party or a night out.

24:16.239 --> 24:19.518
All three struck by a blow
behind, hands tied and raped.

24:19.519 --> 24:22.359
This latest woman apparently
specifically mentioned

24:22.360 --> 24:24.238
that the gag was an old sock.

24:24.239 --> 24:25.878
Could he have used that to gag Trish?

24:25.879 --> 24:27.478
Possible.

24:27.479 --> 24:29.719
If these other two check out,
we've got a serial rapist

24:29.720 --> 24:31.878
who's been preying on women
round here for two years,

24:31.879 --> 24:33.518
and nobody's even known
it was happening.

24:33.519 --> 24:35.518
But that does
rule out Aaron Mayford

24:35.519 --> 24:37.518
because I checked his dates
against the possible date

24:37.519 --> 24:39.758
mentioned by Beth's boss, and
he was in prison at the time.

24:39.759 --> 24:43.478
- But what about the condoms?
- Available in all good chemists.

24:43.479 --> 24:47.399
But he lied about where he was,
about driving that route.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.638
What if they're separate
incidents, different attackers?

24:49.639 --> 24:51.638
What so we've got
two rapists, three rapists?

24:51.639 --> 24:53.638
I don't know, but Trish
and Laura Benson both said

24:53.639 --> 24:55.758
that their attacker smelt of spirits.

24:55.759 --> 24:58.679
I'm with Katie. Something's
not right about Aaron Mayford.

24:58.680 --> 25:02.359
Oh, listen, we're all agreed on
that, but time's running out.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.078
There's too much contradictory
evidence to justify holding him.

25:05.079 --> 25:07.399
We can keep the
surveillance team on him.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.559
When we feel we've got a grip on
this, it slips from our hands.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.518
I know. We need to get the
other victim to come forward.

25:13.519 --> 25:15.038
In the meantime, you know

25:15.039 --> 25:17.078
the lad at the rope
factory, Leo Humphries?

25:17.079 --> 25:19.399
I'm due to speak to
the girl that's his alibi

25:19.400 --> 25:20.759
if you wanna come.

25:22.839 --> 25:25.560
We have to release
Aaron Mayford on bail.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.559
I hope we don't regret this.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.600
Hi, Ed.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.078
- Alright, Ian?
- Yeah.

25:54.079 --> 25:56.958
Uh, listen, you've got
a couple of caravans

25:56.959 --> 25:58.719
on site here you rent out.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.238
- Haven't you?
- Yeah, why?

26:00.239 --> 26:02.559
Well, it's just I'm in the process

26:02.560 --> 26:04.199
of figuring out where to live.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.958
So do you think I could
rent one off you

26:06.959 --> 26:09.079
for a few weeks maybe, this weekend on?

26:09.119 --> 26:11.118
I thought you were
living with what's-her-name.

26:11.119 --> 26:14.720
Sarah. Uh, no, that's not
going so well at the moment.

26:15.759 --> 26:17.638
She's thrown you out.

26:17.639 --> 26:19.279
Yes.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.078
Well, she's about to.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.399
Shit, you had everything -
a good home, lovely wife.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.999
- Yeah, alright, Ed.
- And you blew it all.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.238
Enough!

26:29.239 --> 26:31.078
Can I have a caravan or not?

26:31.079 --> 26:33.958
- That's all I want to know.
- No.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.999
- Sorry?
- No, you can't.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.359
- Why not?
- I don't trust you.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.399
Trish never trusted you.
You don't treat people very well.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.118
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

26:45.119 --> 26:47.119
if you were the one that raped her.

26:49.159 --> 26:52.560
There you go, sweetheart.
Don't climb too high, OK?

26:53.920 --> 26:55.438
I hope you don't mind me saying,

26:55.439 --> 26:57.199
but you look absolutely shattered.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.958
Thanks.
It's been a tricky day.

26:59.959 --> 27:01.638
I wanted to make sure I saw you.

27:01.639 --> 27:03.199
I did what you asked -

27:03.200 --> 27:05.399
I spoke to Trish about
you going to speak to her.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.359
- Great, thanks.
- She didn't want that.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.399
- Oh. Right. OK.
- She said she's not religious.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.399
And didn't know how helpful it'd be.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.280
You said it didn't have to be
about that? It's just support.

27:14.319 --> 27:16.318
I did, I really talked to her about it.

27:16.319 --> 27:18.559
She's not up for seeing you. I'm sorry.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.680
Right.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.518
You say that like I've let you down.

27:23.519 --> 27:24.958
No, no. Not at all.

27:24.959 --> 27:27.238
I am so admiring of you.

27:27.239 --> 27:30.799
It's brilliant, the way
you've turned all of this

27:30.800 --> 27:32.478
into a way to help people.

27:32.479 --> 27:35.199
People really respond to you.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.319
If I'm really honest
with you, I'm a bit envious.

27:42.800 --> 27:47.038
- When did you last see Mark?
- Oh, I knew we'd get on to this.

27:47.039 --> 27:50.838
Paul, I can't be his guardian anymore.

27:50.839 --> 27:52.838
- He's going looking for Joe.
- Yeah.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.118
- You know?
- He hasn't told me.

27:55.119 --> 27:58.399
But it's been coming, I could see it.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.038
Maybe a year or two now, and
this last month, he's got worse.

28:01.039 --> 28:02.438
Can't you stop him?

28:02.439 --> 28:04.118
Why am I still having to think about

28:04.119 --> 28:05.958
clearing up after his shit

28:05.959 --> 28:07.638
even after I've thrown
him out the house?

28:07.639 --> 28:10.238
I can't live in his pain.

28:10.239 --> 28:12.599
I put my energy into
where people want it -

28:12.600 --> 28:14.199
my girls and people like Trish.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.878
Beth, if he does something stupid...

28:15.879 --> 28:18.638
What? It's our fault? No.

28:18.639 --> 28:20.359
His choice.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.639
You can't rescue someone
who doesn't want to be saved.

28:31.479 --> 28:34.878
I've never
read them. The letters.

28:34.879 --> 28:40.078
It didn't seem appropriate and,
uh, the book didn't need them.

28:40.079 --> 28:42.079
So, you know, they're untouched.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.758
Thanks. Thanks for those.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.680
Best be off, then.

28:52.639 --> 28:54.478
You off somewhere?

28:54.479 --> 28:56.838
Yeah. A little break.

28:56.839 --> 28:59.518
Just, you know...
just get a bit of space.

28:59.519 --> 29:00.999
Anywhere nice?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.078
I was thinking maybe Scotland.

29:03.079 --> 29:05.199
- Lovely.
- Yeah.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.279
- Going for long?
- Just a couple of days.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.999
You know, Nige can
manage things at work.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.158
Long way to go for a couple of days.

29:12.159 --> 29:14.199
You a travel agent now?

29:14.200 --> 29:17.039
Might have to be,
the way things are going.

29:18.839 --> 29:20.638
The family know you're off?

29:20.639 --> 29:22.759
Thanks for bringing those, Mag.

29:25.879 --> 29:28.318
Look after yourself, Mark.

29:28.319 --> 29:29.680
Always.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.799
- Danielle Lawrence?
- Yeah?

30:17.800 --> 30:20.478
That's weird. People don't
normally know my name.

30:20.479 --> 30:22.415
- We're not after ice-cream.
- Speak for yourself.

30:22.439 --> 30:24.838
DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.

30:24.839 --> 30:26.438
Oh, OK.

30:26.439 --> 30:28.758
Where were you on the
night of Saturday, 28 May?

30:28.759 --> 30:32.118
Oh, right, yeah. In the Anglers,
with my boyfriend, Leo.

30:32.119 --> 30:33.799
- What time did you get there?
- Half seven.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.318
- What time did you leave?
- Midnight.

30:35.319 --> 30:37.318
Got a kebab on the
high street and went home.

30:37.319 --> 30:39.559
- What sort of kebab?
- Doner.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.199
- Was the kebab shop busy?
- Don't think so, no.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.638
How long have you been
going out with Leo Humphries?

30:45.639 --> 30:48.199
Couple of months on and off.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.199
- See each other every weekend?
- No, not really.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.438
- He with you all night?
- Didn't take my eyes off him.

30:53.439 --> 30:56.158
Whose house did you go back to
at the end of the night?

30:56.159 --> 30:57.758
His. His dad was away.

30:57.759 --> 30:59.638
Leo made me breakfast
in the morning. Scrambled eggs.

30:59.639 --> 31:01.999
- Is he a good cook?
- Not really.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.078
Do you mind if I serve these people?

31:04.079 --> 31:05.478
Oh, no, I think we're done.

31:05.479 --> 31:07.118
We'd like you to come to the station

31:07.119 --> 31:09.238
just to sign a statement
confirming what you've told us.

31:09.239 --> 31:11.238
Basically just says if you're lying

31:11.239 --> 31:13.518
you'll go to prison for perjury.

31:13.519 --> 31:15.319
- No problem.
- OK.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.559
We'll be in touch. Thanks, Danielle.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.479
Hiya! What can I get you?

31:20.759 --> 31:22.999
- Do you believe her?
- Not a word.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.600
I'm getting sick of people lying to us.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.999
Where are you going?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.518
Where does it look
like I'm going? Work.

31:39.519 --> 31:42.919
- We're about to eat.
- Not bothered.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.319
God's sake.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.600
Something to say?

31:52.920 --> 31:55.199
I've been cooking.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.799
You watched me cooking.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.600
I haven't watched you.

31:59.759 --> 32:02.119
I don't pay any attention
to what you're doing.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.680
Clive!

32:12.680 --> 32:16.799
- Oh, hi.
- I was just going.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.958
- Not on my account.
- Yeah.

32:18.959 --> 32:21.359
Good luck. It's gonna be OK.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.238
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, just be gentle with her.

32:25.239 --> 32:28.038
- She's a good girl.
- What?

32:28.039 --> 32:30.078
Is something wrong?

32:30.079 --> 32:34.478
Are you OK?

32:34.479 --> 32:36.919
Not really.

32:36.920 --> 32:40.079
I hate it here, Dad.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.279
Well, you'll get used to it.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.318
I won't.

32:45.319 --> 32:46.680
Not now.

32:48.519 --> 32:50.159
What do you mean by that?

32:52.239 --> 32:54.118
Someone took my phone

32:54.119 --> 32:56.518
and they went through my photos.

32:56.519 --> 33:02.238
And in my photos, there was a picture,

33:02.239 --> 33:03.759
and they sent it to everyone.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.000
What was the photo, Daise?

33:09.039 --> 33:11.560
Don't make me show you.

33:14.319 --> 33:15.680
Oh.

33:16.759 --> 33:19.360
Sweetheart, no.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.280
Everyone in the school saw it.

33:24.079 --> 33:27.078
Now all the boys are hounding
me and I can't stay here.

33:27.079 --> 33:29.838
- When was this?
- A couple of weeks ago.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.719
Couple of weeks? Why didn't you say?

33:31.720 --> 33:33.478
You're never here.

33:33.479 --> 33:37.118
- There's a case...
- There's always a case.

33:37.119 --> 33:39.159
The case is always more important.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
You said it would be different here.

33:42.039 --> 33:45.560
- It is.
- No, it's worse.

33:54.039 --> 33:57.038
- Dani.
- Police came, like you said.

33:57.039 --> 33:59.758
What did you say?

33:59.759 --> 34:01.239
What you told me to.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.679
They said if I was lying,
I could go to prison.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.159
Who said you're lying?

34:09.400 --> 34:11.559
That's the third favour you owe me now.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.679
What are you doing Thursday?

34:13.679 --> 34:16.279
Don't know,
but it'll be expensive.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.158
Hello, mate. I'm going home.
You know the place.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.998
Expensive, will it?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.079
Good. I'm up for anything, me.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.638
You have got to be kidding me.

34:43.639 --> 34:47.000
Not today. God's sake.

35:05.839 --> 35:07.719
I'm still on my break, Ed.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.359
I know, but you look like
you might need a cuppa.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.559
Oh. Right.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.439
Thank you.

35:18.039 --> 35:20.919
- Am I attractive, Ed?
- What?

35:20.920 --> 35:22.758
Come on, it's a simple enough question.

35:22.759 --> 35:25.238
Right, well, um...

35:25.239 --> 35:27.839
I have to be careful,
'cause as your boss,

35:27.879 --> 35:29.518
you know, sexual harassment laws...

35:29.519 --> 35:32.158
Alright, alright, look -
if you didn't know me,

35:32.159 --> 35:36.719
would you want to... have sex with me?

35:36.720 --> 35:38.838
Well, yeah, probably.

35:38.839 --> 35:40.838
Probably?

35:40.839 --> 35:42.599
Well, thanks for
the ringing endorsement.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.359
Alright then, definitely! What
sort of question's that anyway?

35:45.360 --> 35:49.719
I don't know, I just...
wanna know if I'm past it.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.399
Course you're not past it!

35:51.400 --> 35:54.599
Why would you say that?
You're a good-looking woman!

35:54.600 --> 35:56.758
You've got a husband
that's a bit of a knob,

35:56.759 --> 35:58.439
but that's not your fault.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.239
Jim slept with Trish.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.438
- What?
- Yeah.

36:05.439 --> 36:08.638
- Jim and Trish?
- Morning of my party.

36:08.639 --> 36:10.359
She wouldn't do that!

36:10.360 --> 36:13.199
Look, I know you think
the sun shines out of her arse,

36:13.200 --> 36:15.478
but she shagged my husband.

36:15.479 --> 36:18.438
Or he shagged...
They shagged each other.

36:18.439 --> 36:19.959
She told me.

36:21.639 --> 36:23.078
What was she thinking of?

36:23.079 --> 36:27.279
My God!

36:27.280 --> 36:29.518
Full marks for being a shitty consoler.

36:29.519 --> 36:31.519
Sorry.

36:32.639 --> 36:34.159
What are you gonna do?

36:36.079 --> 36:37.758
I don't know.

36:37.759 --> 36:41.759
He's had women before,
I know that, but this just...

36:42.879 --> 36:44.400
hurts more.

36:46.319 --> 36:47.878
I get that.

36:47.879 --> 36:51.359
I just thought my life would
be that I'd love someone

36:51.360 --> 36:53.239
and they'd love me back and...

36:55.319 --> 36:57.800
it would last my whole life.

36:59.879 --> 37:01.600
Why's that so much to ask?

37:16.879 --> 37:21.679
Brilliant!

37:21.680 --> 37:24.158
Seriously, mate, that is classic.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.360
Breakdown lorry broken down.

37:27.239 --> 37:29.399
No, don't be an arsehole.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.680
Ugh!

37:33.200 --> 37:35.919
What, you don't want me
to tow it for you then?

37:35.920 --> 37:38.000
Very funny.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.238
Bad about your party, wasn't it?

37:43.239 --> 37:45.079
- Dunno what you mean.
- Don't you?

37:46.119 --> 37:48.158
Can't really believe it, can you?

37:48.159 --> 37:50.919
What some people are capable of.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.719
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.638
It's all anyone's talking about,
soon as they get in the cab.

37:55.639 --> 37:57.479
You're the only one
who doesn't fancy her.

38:00.959 --> 38:02.560
Poor Trish.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.878
How'd you know it was her?

38:05.879 --> 38:08.878
Mate, it's all round the town.

38:08.879 --> 38:11.599
At least they kept her
name out of the papers.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.719
Hard for you and your wife.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.680
Must've been someone you invited.

38:17.039 --> 38:19.280
- Must it?
- Just by logic.

38:20.119 --> 38:22.158
Why are you so interested?

38:22.159 --> 38:25.758
Well, I dropped some people
there and back that night.

38:25.759 --> 38:27.638
Ah, right.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.758
So you were around the place,
but you weren't invited.

38:30.759 --> 38:33.958
Yeah, I see
what you're doing there.

38:33.959 --> 38:35.838
Ah, do you?

38:35.839 --> 38:37.919
Funny, though. I saw you.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.758
With Trish.

38:39.759 --> 38:41.719
I was parked up,
you were out the front,

38:41.720 --> 38:43.438
to the side of the house.

38:43.439 --> 38:46.599
Looked like quite an intense chat.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.158
What are you saying? You were
spying on me at my wife's party?

38:50.159 --> 38:51.999
Not spying, mate, just saw.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.279
Ah, you just saw two friends talking.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.799
Uh, it looked a bit more than that.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.279
- Pull over.
- What?

38:59.280 --> 39:02.280
I said pull over
before I smack you hard.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.639
Listen, I don't want any trouble.

39:19.159 --> 39:21.158
Do you know who you're talking to, hmm?

39:21.159 --> 39:23.958
Do you know how many people
I know in this town?

39:23.959 --> 39:25.799
Not really.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.638
I know your boss,
I know your colleagues

39:28.639 --> 39:30.318
and I know your customers.

39:30.319 --> 39:33.279
I can find out about your wife,
your kids, your pets.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.920
And I can very easily make your life

39:35.959 --> 39:38.439
much more of a misery
than it must already be.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.239
- Right.
- Right.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.478
<i>You have one new message.</i>

40:42.479 --> 40:44.638
<i>Mark, it's me.</i>

40:44.639 --> 40:48.720
<i>Can you call me, please?
I'm worried about you.</i>

40:51.239 --> 40:53.800
<i>Message deleted.</i>

41:16.879 --> 41:18.599
Trish Winterman is attacked here.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.999
Attack on Laura Benson here.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.038
And then a third in Budmouth, here.

41:22.039 --> 41:25.518
So one on private
land, one in an open field

41:25.519 --> 41:27.719
and the other on the edge of a town.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.318
All quite obscure areas, I suppose.

41:30.319 --> 41:32.838
You'd only tend to go to
those places deliberately,

41:32.839 --> 41:34.279
which might suggest someone local.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.238
Aye, it might, but we're
clutching at straws.

41:36.239 --> 41:38.078
We are a bit.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.599
How about we cross-reference those areas

41:40.600 --> 41:43.799
with the addresses of all
the guests at the Atwood party?

41:43.800 --> 41:45.319
OK. We'll give it a go.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.559
Thank you.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.119
- For coming here.
- That's fine.

41:50.159 --> 41:52.118
Can have a word with her if you like.

41:52.119 --> 41:54.559
- Think it would help?
- I don't know. Your daughter.

41:54.560 --> 41:58.559
I just feel like I'm failing
at everything, Miller.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.999
That's parenting.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.280
It's like one constant
slap around the head.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.719
Oh, wait. Wait, what if
it's not geographical?

42:06.720 --> 42:08.399
- What if it's seasonal?
- What?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.118
All the attacks happened
in the summer months.

42:10.119 --> 42:12.199
Two in June, one right
at the end of May.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.879
There isn't a link in where
but there is a link in when.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.518
That'd point to someone
not here all year.

42:16.519 --> 42:18.559
Yeah - seasonal worker,
returning tourist.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.958
No, 'cause how does that connect
to the people at the party?

42:20.959 --> 42:23.399
- They're all mates, all live round here.
- God, I don't know.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.399
That doesn't narrow it down,
Miller, that makes it wider.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.279
I'm doing the best I can,
following the information.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.958
All we need is one name.

42:28.959 --> 42:30.200
Just one hit.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.719
What?

42:33.720 --> 42:35.118
It's Arthur Tamworth

42:35.119 --> 42:36.800
from Axehampton House.

42:36.839 --> 42:38.999
I was given this number to call.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.078
Only, I don't know whether my dog

42:42.079 --> 42:44.239
might have found something pertinent.

43:12.839 --> 43:14.518
Closed.

43:14.519 --> 43:16.680
Are you deaf? I said we're closed.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.719
I just noticed Pedro
had it in his mouth.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.279
No idea where he found it
or how long he'd had it.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.559
I thought I should call you,

44:09.560 --> 44:12.438
even though it is just an old sock.

44:12.439 --> 44:15.199
One never knows in your
line of work, I suppose.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.079
Quite.

44:25.239 --> 44:26.838
Right, lads. Let's call it.

44:26.839 --> 44:28.758
Let's get your bibs in the bag.

44:28.759 --> 44:31.118
Kits to me when you're changed.

44:31.119 --> 44:33.919
My turn to wash again.

44:33.920 --> 44:37.159
Unless I can get a lucky
lady to do it for me.
