00:04.500 --> 00:06.708
With Earth Central
reporting a 15% drop

00:06.792 --> 00:08.292
in station revenue
over the past 2 months.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.583
Why the drop?

00:09.667 --> 00:11.375
We've had a lot of Earthforce
military transports

00:11.458 --> 00:12.875
come through lately, forcing us

00:12.958 --> 00:14.917
to route some of our
commercial traffic elsewhere.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.875
They say it's only temporary.
We should be back on track soon.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.417
Good, good. Anything else?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.750
Just one last item..

00:22.833 --> 00:25.167
...which also affects
the station budget.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.500
'Since we've been running
at a deficit for a while and..'

00:29.167 --> 00:30.625
I thought you would have
heard about it by now.

00:30.708 --> 00:32.750
Uh-uh. Heard about what?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.833
The space on Babylon 5
is at a premium.

00:34.917 --> 00:36.083
The larger the living quarters

00:36.167 --> 00:38.875
the more
Earth can charge for rent.

00:38.958 --> 00:40.208
They've decided
that our quarters

00:40.292 --> 00:42.167
are larger than necessary.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.000
They want us to relocate
to smaller quarters

00:45.083 --> 00:46.917
or start paying rent.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.333
- Rent?
- Yes, sir.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.542
Thirty credits a week,
starting immediately.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.708
A-and this us would be--

00:52.792 --> 00:55.125
You and me, yes. Everyone
else is pretty much to code.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.292
Oh, yeah, well,
you can tell Earth Central

00:56.375 --> 00:57.792
they can take a flying--

00:57.875 --> 00:59.958
It's only 30 credits a week,
sir. It's not that much.

01:00.042 --> 01:01.583
I don't care
if it's one credit a week.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.917
I don't care
if it's one credit a month!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.458
It's the principle of the thing.

01:05.542 --> 01:07.333
Some of the smaller quarters
are actually quite nice.

01:07.417 --> 01:11.083
Ivanova, I am not moving
and I am not paying the rent.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.708
- And neither are you.
- Sir?

01:12.792 --> 01:16.500
Look, we can't let them
divide us on this. It is wrong.

01:16.583 --> 01:19.958
I mean, we are on call
24 hours a day, 7 days a week

01:20.042 --> 01:21.708
busting our butts for Earth

01:21.792 --> 01:24.833
and now they wanna charge us
for an extra five square feet?

01:24.917 --> 01:26.583
- Seven feet.
- Well..

01:26.667 --> 01:28.625
Whatever.

01:28.708 --> 01:31.333
I-I'll go live in down below
before I'll pay 'em a penny

01:31.417 --> 01:33.000
and you can tell
those bean-counters

01:33.083 --> 01:34.833
that they can go to hell.

01:34.917 --> 01:37.375
- And that's for both of us.
- Yes, sir.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.333
And it was starting out to be
such a nice, quiet, little day.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.833
[droning]

01:52.750 --> 01:55.208
This is unnecessary, you know?

01:55.292 --> 01:57.083
If you just give us
the information we need

01:57.167 --> 01:59.000
we could stop this.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.167
We don't blame you.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.458
You fell under the influence
of outsiders.

02:04.542 --> 02:08.208
They used you
and then abandoned you.

02:36.292 --> 02:39.042
We know you gave them access

Who's running the operation?

'But you know
where they're going, don't you?'

02:53.000 --> 02:54.417
There has to be
a central clearing house

Why don't you go ahead

if you could help me..

Uh, this is difficult.

If you could help me

07:10.583 --> 07:12.500
I'm not one of you.

a bridge of understanding

07:14.708 --> 07:16.958
between humans and Minbari

more about your people.

So what would you suggest?

- Dinner?
- Dinner.

And I think
that I would like to.

Anything, everything.

is being most unfair
to the others.

For some time now, we have been
aware of an underground railroad

08:46.417 --> 08:49.250
smuggling unregistered telepaths
away from Earth

08:49.333 --> 08:52.292
to the outer colonies where
the corps can't reach them.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.792
Well, so far
I don't see a problem.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.917
The problem, Commander Ivanova

08:57.000 --> 09:00.667
is that unregistered telepaths
are a security risk.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.292

Technically..

09:38.583 --> 09:40.292
...yeah, I suppose.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.625
And we're obliged to uphold
the laws of Earth Alliance.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.750
That doesn't mean
we have to like it.

of illegitimate travel

it's a threat

you can't tell me

09:51.208 --> 09:52.875

nothing to do with it.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.292
That's damn ironic, isn't it?

09:59.375 --> 10:00.500
That the corps got
started because

10:00.583 --> 10:02.417
we were afraid
of telepaths?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.750
Now they're victims
of our own fears?

10:04.833 --> 10:07.000
And we took away every right
they had and shoved them

10:07.083 --> 10:09.708
into a big, black box
called Psi Corps.

Open up. Drop the walls. Listen.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.792
[indistinct murmuring]

11:36.000 --> 11:37.917
I'm sorry.
It's all background noise.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.417
They're here.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.292
I was right.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.667
[dramatic music]

12:00.292 --> 12:02.792
He's here, alright. I saw him.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.667
Did he sense you?

12:04.750 --> 12:07.625
I, I don't, I don't know. Maybe.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.000
'Look, we-we knew this was gonna
happen sooner or later.'

12:10.083 --> 12:11.667
So what we have to do now
is warn the runner

12:11.750 --> 12:14.000
and get the hell out of here.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.458
Uh, I know.

12:15.542 --> 12:18.167
I-I know
Bester will try to stop us.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.417
So we don't have any choice.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.875
We have to kill him.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.583
[indistinct chattering]

12:50.958 --> 12:52.333
[chuckles]

12:52.417 --> 12:55.333
I apologize for being late,
captain.

12:55.417 --> 12:59.333
I decided that as part
of learning more about humans

12:59.417 --> 13:02.167
I would try
to dress like one tonight.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.833
- Huh.
- I hope it does not offend you.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.500
No, no, not at all.

13:06.583 --> 13:09.292
I mean, it's very attractive.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.792
Uh, please.

13:17.792 --> 13:19.667
Something I can do for you?

13:24.333 --> 13:25.708
[clears throat]

13:27.792 --> 13:29.667
It appears
my choice was successful.

13:29.750 --> 13:30.750
[chuckles]

13:30.833 --> 13:32.875
The woman who sold me this

13:32.958 --> 13:36.625
told me that I would
definitely turn heads?

13:36.708 --> 13:39.375
[chuckles]
Yeah, well, if they
turned much further

13:39.458 --> 13:41.208
you'd be sued for whiplash.

13:41.292 --> 13:42.375
[laughs]

13:42.458 --> 13:44.500
Um, what would you like
to start with?

13:44.583 --> 13:46.667
- Start with?
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.375
I don't know, um..

13:48.458 --> 13:50.792
Uh, this is all so new to me.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.375
- Um..
- What would you recommend?

13:54.417 --> 13:57.167
Well. Let's see
what we have, hm?

14:01.833 --> 14:04.750
[indistinct chattering]

14:08.833 --> 14:11.625
(Ivanova)
'Hey, Michael! Over here!'

14:14.500 --> 14:16.250
Look, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:16.333 --> 14:17.375
What, is this official business?

14:17.458 --> 14:18.792
- Yeah.
- Hey, everybody!

14:18.875 --> 14:21.375
Garibaldi's here
on official business.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.083
(female #2)
'Oh, well, then..'

14:23.167 --> 14:24.000
[bell rings]

14:24.083 --> 14:26.833
Next round's on Mr. Garibaldi!

14:26.917 --> 14:28.833
[all cheering]

14:28.917 --> 14:30.208
Come on, you know the rules.

14:30.292 --> 14:32.042
No official business
inside Earhart's

14:32.125 --> 14:33.292
or you buy everybody drinks.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.750
I-I know, I know,
but I was kind of hoping

14:34.833 --> 14:37.125
to talk to you on the QT.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.542
- Oops.
- Yeah, oops.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.667
So what can I do for you?

14:44.750 --> 14:47.292
I need a contact inside
the underground railroad.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.333
Great! Good hunting to you.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.792
So what have I
got to do with it?

14:50.875 --> 14:53.208
- Come on, Ivanova, this is me.
- Yes, it is.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.458
And you're so cute
when you're worried about

14:54.542 --> 14:56.917
investigating someone
close to you.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.708
This time you're dead wrong.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.458
Look, Michael, there's no
love lost between me

15:00.542 --> 15:03.875
and the Psi Corps, but I've got
nothing to do with this.

15:03.958 --> 15:06.375
[laughs]
You look like
you just swallowed a bug.

15:06.458 --> 15:07.917
An operation like this
couldn't work

15:08.000 --> 15:10.125
without support from someone
inside the station.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.250
I figured it was you. Nuts.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.125
'Well, have a good time
figuring it out.'

15:14.208 --> 15:16.833
Me? I'm gonna go back to my
quarters and get some sleep.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.708
That's the other thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.500
(Sheridan)
After we cleaned up the debris,
I told him

15:23.583 --> 15:26.208
"Mack, if you ever
bring that cat

15:26.292 --> 15:27.792
"within 15 feet of me again

15:27.875 --> 15:29.333
I will have you both
up on charges."

15:29.417 --> 15:32.083
[laughing]

15:32.167 --> 15:35.292
We do not have cats on Minbari.
We have gogs.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.542
- Gogs?
- Gogs.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.708
[laughing]

15:38.792 --> 15:41.000
I think such creatures
are an attempt by the universe

15:41.083 --> 15:44.667
to make sure that we never
take ourselves too seriously.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.333
You know what's funny?

15:47.417 --> 15:48.875
When I think of Minbari

15:48.958 --> 15:51.708
I don't generally
think of them laughing.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.833
Is that part of the change

15:54.917 --> 15:56.917
you've gone through or..

15:57.000 --> 15:58.667
We believe that no race

15:58.750 --> 16:02.083
can be truly intelligent
without laughter.

16:02.167 --> 16:04.417
In temple,
we spend one whole year

16:04.500 --> 16:06.708
just learning
how to appreciate humor.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.417
Huh.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.792
This must seem
very strange to you.

16:10.875 --> 16:13.375
No other race we've encountered
has anything similar.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.458
Oh, then you're in
for a big shock.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.875
Back on Earth
we have the laughing Buddha.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.125
And then there's
the school of Zen mysticism

16:20.208 --> 16:22.708
that teaches enlightenment
through laughter.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.542
It would appear that
we have much more in common

16:25.625 --> 16:28.000
than we imagined.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.208
Yeah.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.500
Who'd have thought?

16:35.792 --> 16:38.583
[beeping]

16:40.125 --> 16:43.292
- Oh.
- Ah, Ms. Winters. Good.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.792
I know it's late.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.750
I've been thinking about
our last experience together.

16:49.833 --> 16:54.083
That Jason Ironheart situation
and, and now this.

16:54.167 --> 16:56.042
I've been more than
a little rude to you

16:56.125 --> 16:57.833
and I'd like to make up for it.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.750
As our representative
on Babylon 5

16:59.833 --> 17:02.667
it occurs to me that we should
know each other a little better.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.792
Perhaps you'd join me
for breakfast tomorrow morning.

17:10.042 --> 17:11.583
I'll be there.

17:13.417 --> 17:14.542
Good.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.417
Goodnight, Ms. Winters.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.542
[beeps]

17:31.042 --> 17:33.208
(Bester)
His name is Jason Ironheart.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.667
(Talia)
We were lovers.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.125
Do you know what it's like

17:38.208 --> 17:41.125
when telepaths make love,
commander?

17:41.208 --> 17:43.292
There is no more Jason.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.667
I am something else.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.625
I am becoming..

17:50.708 --> 17:52.417
Becoming what?

17:53.208 --> 17:55.167
Everything.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.583
(Talia)
He came to say goodbye,
commander.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.167
[zapping]

18:00.250 --> 18:02.250
He came to say goodbye.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.292
(Jason)
I give you a gift.

18:07.375 --> 18:10.625
[echoing]
The only gift
I have to give.

18:29.958 --> 18:32.000
He's been in my mind
twice today.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.792
Why isn't he seeing this?

18:41.125 --> 18:43.250
Was that the other part
of the gift?

18:48.042 --> 18:49.083
[sighs]

18:51.125 --> 18:53.042
[buzzing]

18:53.125 --> 18:54.792
[beeping]

18:58.375 --> 19:00.542
[beeping]

19:00.625 --> 19:02.500
Forget it.

19:02.583 --> 19:03.958
- They've been sealed.
- What?

19:04.042 --> 19:05.500
'Direct orders
from Earth Central.'

19:05.583 --> 19:06.958
Your quarters and mine
have been sealed

19:07.042 --> 19:08.375
until we either move
to smaller quarters

19:08.458 --> 19:10.750
or begin paying rent
on the bigger ones.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.667
Garibaldi let me know
a little while ago.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.958
If they think that they're gonna
pressure me like this

19:16.042 --> 19:17.375
they're wrong.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.208
You got something
we can jimmy this thing with?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.375
I already tried it on my door,
set off the sprinklers

19:21.458 --> 19:23.167
scrambled the lock codes
on both sides of the hall

19:23.250 --> 19:25.542
and scared the hell
out of security.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.375
I was just on my way
to rent a room when I saw you.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.333
No! No way in hell.

19:29.417 --> 19:32.792
That's just as bad as paying
them for using our own quarters.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.250
'No, sir.'

19:35.333 --> 19:37.750
Millions for defense,
but not one penny for tribute.

19:37.833 --> 19:40.250
[laughing]
Alright, then,
what do you suggest?

19:40.333 --> 19:43.375
[dramatic music]

19:49.042 --> 19:50.417
Again.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.167
They can't scan us
if they don't catch us.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.417
We just have to make sure
we don't get caught.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.083
That's what Jenson thought.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.792
And just before he died,
he cracked.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.917
We can't afford it. Do it again.

20:25.042 --> 20:26.625

'Comfortable?'

20:26.708 --> 20:28.708
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.750
Got to take a hard line
with these people, Susan.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.000
Can't show a moment's weakness.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.250
Yes, sir.

20:38.083 --> 20:41.083
[chuckles]
I heard a good one today.

20:41.167 --> 20:44.917
How many Minbari does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

20:45.000 --> 20:45.958
I don't know, sir.

20:46.042 --> 20:47.083
How many Minbari does it take

20:47.167 --> 20:48.625
to screw in a light bulb?

20:48.708 --> 20:51.833
None, they always surrender
right before they finish the job

20:51.917 --> 20:53.167
and they never tell you why.

20:53.250 --> 20:56.250
[laughs]

20:57.583 --> 20:59.208
Oh..

20:59.292 --> 21:01.542
Knock-knock.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.167
- Who's there?
- Kosh.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.083
- Kosh who?
Gesundheit.

21:06.167 --> 21:08.167

[Sheridan laughing]

21:14.417 --> 21:15.917
Were you like this
when you were married?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Huh? Yeah.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.625
The woman was a saint.

21:21.042 --> 21:23.167
Well, at least
I'm an intelligent life form

21:23.250 --> 21:25.083
according to the Minbari.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.042
[sighs]

21:27.125 --> 21:29.500
I think I like that.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.667
I think I like that a lot.

have been a little tense'

21:43.625 --> 21:46.208
ever since the president died.

21:46.292 --> 21:48.875
Yes. That was quite
a blow here, too.

21:50.292 --> 21:53.708
Do they ever talk
about what happened..

21:53.792 --> 21:55.250
...the captain, the others?

21:55.333 --> 21:58.083
Sometimes. Why?

21:58.167 --> 22:00.083
According to the news,
it was an accident.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.042
And so it was.

22:02.125 --> 22:05.958
Still, if you could keep
an eye on things for us, we..

22:06.042 --> 22:07.625
Almost ready.
In position.

22:07.708 --> 22:10.208

Okay. I got a sure shot.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.542
They must be getting desperate
to try something like this.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.250
They know we're on to them.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.917
Why else would
they try to kill me?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.917
Is this
a multiple choice question?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.292
What about Talia?

22:50.375 --> 22:51.958
As far as I know, she got out.

22:52.042 --> 22:54.625
You mean, you haven't heard
from her since the attack?

22:54.708 --> 22:57.292
No, but I'm sure she's fine.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.958
It's me they were after.

22:59.042 --> 23:00.917
Unless they took her
in order to get to you.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.500
Has that thought
ever occurred to you

23:02.583 --> 23:04.208
now that you've managed
to save your own skin?

23:04.292 --> 23:05.792
(Bester)
'It won't do them any good.'

23:05.875 --> 23:08.250
She doesn't know anything
that could hurt me or the corps.

Doesn't get it, does he?

23:13.833 --> 23:15.958
Hey, wake up! To hell with
what she does or doesn't knows!

23:16.042 --> 23:18.792
- She could be dead right now!
- Garibaldi!

23:18.875 --> 23:20.125
You should have told us
she was missing

23:20.208 --> 23:21.667
as soon as you called in.

23:21.750 --> 23:24.250
If you're this worried,
Mr. Garibaldi

23:24.333 --> 23:27.125
I suggest you double your
efforts to find these people.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.042
You've got two bodies
to start with.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.583
Make the best of them.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.208
(female #3)
It's too risky.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.417
- It's too risky.
- She's with the Psi Corps.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.417
(male #4)
Have to kill her
before she identifies us.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.583
(male #5)
No, we need to know
what she knows.

23:45.667 --> 23:46.917
(female #4)
Wait.

23:50.917 --> 23:53.958
[dramatic music]

24:06.875 --> 24:09.875
[panting]

24:21.792 --> 24:24.000
We don't wanna hurt you.

24:24.083 --> 24:27.083
We will if we have to,
but we don't want to.

24:27.167 --> 24:29.917
You're-you're only
hurting yourselves.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.875
The corps is here
to protect you.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.958
I don't believe that
and neither do you.

24:34.042 --> 24:35.042
That's not true.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.333
It will be very soon.

24:37.417 --> 24:39.375
You're almost there.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.042
Almost where?

24:42.958 --> 24:45.208
What do you want from me?

24:45.292 --> 24:46.542
We want you..

24:48.458 --> 24:50.583
...to understand.

24:50.667 --> 24:51.833
(Franklin)
Just heard from the people

24:51.917 --> 24:53.417
running the underground
railroad.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.083
They've got Talia.
No, no, no, she's okay.

24:56.167 --> 24:58.583
They haven't hurt her
and they don't intend to.

24:58.667 --> 25:00.250
They want to arrange
a meeting between you

25:00.333 --> 25:03.083
and the head of the operation.
Just you, nobody else.

25:03.167 --> 25:05.417
And if anyone else shows,
the meeting's off.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.833
And if I don't come,
what happens to Talia?

25:07.917 --> 25:09.167
Nothing.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.083
Well, this isn't
a hostage situation, captain.

25:11.167 --> 25:12.833
The situation
is spinning out of control.

25:12.917 --> 25:13.917
They're, they're trapped.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.125
They're trying to find a way out

25:15.208 --> 25:16.583
without anyone else
getting hurt.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.250
And you think I can trust them?

25:18.333 --> 25:19.792
- Yes.
- Why?

25:19.875 --> 25:22.500
I can't tell you right now.

25:22.583 --> 25:24.500
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

25:25.917 --> 25:29.000
Alright. When and where?

25:29.083 --> 25:30.542
And I guess that's how
they found my brother

25:30.625 --> 25:32.917
before they found me.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.708
They said he could
either join the corps

25:34.792 --> 25:36.958
go into a relocation camp

25:37.042 --> 25:39.083
or take the sleepers

25:39.167 --> 25:42.458
so he wouldn't accidentally
violate the privacy of normals.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.917
'Well, he took the sleepers.'

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
'They shut off his talent,
but it didn't stop him'

25:47.083 --> 25:49.625
'from speaking out
against the corps.'

25:49.708 --> 25:52.083
He wrote to senate, to media

25:52.167 --> 25:54.750
got interviewed by ISN..

25:54.833 --> 25:56.333
Until one day, when they came

25:56.417 --> 25:58.792
to give him his injection.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.292
He closed his eyes
and never woke up.

26:01.375 --> 26:02.917
The corps
doesn't murder its own.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.250
'I was there.'

26:04.333 --> 26:07.083
All you need to do
is scan me to see for yourself.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.792
- I don't want to.
- You're afraid to.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.875
The corps raised me.
It gave me everything I have--

26:11.958 --> 26:14.625
And took away everything
you were born with.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.708
Took away your freedom,
made you wear that badge

26:16.792 --> 26:19.500
and those gloves
every day of your life

26:19.583 --> 26:22.625
while you were out
among normals.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.000
Keeps you separate from them,
from each other.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.167
Dependent, afraid.

26:26.250 --> 26:29.000
- You're distorting everything.
- Am I?

26:29.083 --> 26:32.083
Bester shot your friend,
Ironheart.

26:32.917 --> 26:35.875
But, hey, he was a rogue.

26:35.958 --> 26:38.125
A runaway, just like us.

26:38.208 --> 26:40.292
'But that's not the worst.'

26:43.750 --> 26:46.375
- You wanted to see me?
- Wanted to?

26:47.375 --> 26:48.667
Not really.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.333
But I guess I have to, don't I?

26:51.417 --> 26:53.167
Mr. Garibaldi..

26:53.250 --> 26:56.167
...I know we've had our problems
in the past.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.500
But I'm not the enemy.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.375
'We have the same concerns,
you and I.'

26:59.458 --> 27:02.250
'We wanna protect our own
and protect Earth.'

27:04.042 --> 27:05.708
[beeps]

27:05.792 --> 27:06.917
Would it interest you to know

27:07.042 --> 27:09.167
that I am married,
Mr. Garibaldi?

27:09.250 --> 27:11.167
'That I have
a five-year-old daughter?'

27:11.250 --> 27:14.167
That on Sundays when I'm back
home, we pack a picnic lunch

27:14.250 --> 27:18.000
and go out under the dome
on Syria Planum

27:18.083 --> 27:20.167
and watch the stars come out?

27:22.417 --> 27:24.583
Hardly the description
of a monster.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.833
Smooth. You're getting good
at this. Keep working on it.

27:29.917 --> 27:32.542
One of these days I might even
be convinced that you're human.

27:34.125 --> 27:35.875
Here's the information
you asked for.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.708
The two shooters were living in
down below like I figured.

27:38.792 --> 27:40.000
It's tough to track
expenses down there

27:40.083 --> 27:41.542
and most of it's bartered.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.083
But they were both living
on the same level.

27:43.167 --> 27:44.750
Probably wanted
to stick close together

27:44.833 --> 27:47.667
for mutual protection..

27:47.750 --> 27:49.583
...which means..

27:49.667 --> 27:52.333
...the others
might be there as well.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.875
That's what I figured.
I'm putting a team together now.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.458
We'll pick you up
at your quarters in an hour

27:56.542 --> 27:57.750
and we'll go in together.

27:57.833 --> 28:00.292
That's together, clear?

28:00.375 --> 28:01.750
Of course.

28:01.833 --> 28:05.750
My, uh, talent woke up
when I hit puberty.

28:07.833 --> 28:10.917
The corps took me in,
said I was a P-11

28:11.000 --> 28:13.667
as high as you can go before
they turn you into a Psi Cop.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.583
After 2 years,
they picked another P-11

28:18.667 --> 28:20.542
and said I had to marry him.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.917
They wanted to increase the odds

28:24.000 --> 28:27.167
of breeding a P-12 or higher.

28:28.667 --> 28:29.917
I refused.

28:32.708 --> 28:35.417
One night I woke up..

28:36.875 --> 28:38.583
...heard voices.

28:40.375 --> 28:43.333
Something soft over my face.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.625
Felt hands
lifting me out of bed.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.292
The next morning
they tried to tell me

28:48.375 --> 28:49.917
it was all just a dream.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.458
Four weeks later,
I discovered I was pregnant.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.333
Oh, my God.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.500
When she was born,
they took her from me.

29:00.583 --> 29:03.417
As soon as I could walk,
I escaped from the hospital.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.292
I never saw my baby again.

29:21.417 --> 29:24.333
Maybe the corps served
a function a long time ago.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.333
Now it's something else.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.958
I know it, you know it.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.208
We can't let it go on this way.

29:35.583 --> 29:38.333
So what do you expect me to do?

29:38.417 --> 29:41.208
Snap my fingers
and make it all go away?

29:41.292 --> 29:43.833
You're asking me
to take everything I believe

29:43.917 --> 29:46.292
and turn it upside down.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.792
'Why?'

29:48.875 --> 29:50.583
Why are you telling me this?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.583
Because you're special.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.542
How do you know?

29:57.625 --> 29:59.417
Your friend, Ironheart..

30:02.917 --> 30:05.500
...he was my friend, too.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.750
They experimented
on both of us, they..

30:07.833 --> 30:09.042
They pushed me up here.

30:09.125 --> 30:11.667
They made me a P-12,
maybe even a P-13.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.542
But Ironheart..

30:13.625 --> 30:15.792
'...he went further
than I did.'

30:15.875 --> 30:18.292
He went further than
anyone will ever go again.

30:21.792 --> 30:24.125
When he escaped,
I went with him.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.333
Help set all this up.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.875
I know he touched you.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.083
I know he gave you something.

30:38.958 --> 30:41.167
I know you can help us
if you want to.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.875
[dramatic music]

31:09.500 --> 31:10.875
Hello, captain.

31:13.083 --> 31:16.375
But I thought the message said
for me to come alone.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.583
It did.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.208
Well, don't you think
your presence

31:19.292 --> 31:21.875
might scare off the guy
who's running this operation?

31:21.958 --> 31:23.125
'No, not really'

31:23.208 --> 31:25.750
considering I am the guy
running this operation.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.875
I hope you have
one hell of a good explanation

31:31.958 --> 31:33.125
for this, doctor.

31:35.958 --> 31:37.875
I think he does, captain.

31:37.958 --> 31:40.292
And I think
you should listen to him.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.542
I think you should listen
to all of them.

31:48.583 --> 31:51.542
[dramatic music]

31:55.292 --> 31:58.000
Back on Earth, I heard things.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.292
The kind of things you're
not supposed to hear about.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.833
Genetic manipulation..

32:03.917 --> 32:07.042
...breeding telepaths
against their will..

32:07.125 --> 32:10.167
...so-called relocation camps
for rogue telepaths

32:10.250 --> 32:12.750
that aren't much better
than concentration camps.

32:12.833 --> 32:14.792
It started when
a few doctors began referring

32:14.875 --> 32:16.167
latent telepaths to each other.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.042
Keeping them out of circulation.

32:18.125 --> 32:21.167
Losing reports and changing
medical history files.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.167
But we couldn't just keep moving
'em around like checkers.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.458
We had to get them away
from Earth.

32:25.542 --> 32:28.708
'They were filtered into
Babylon 5 on business visas.'

32:28.792 --> 32:31.000
Well, last year
I set up a clinic down below

32:31.083 --> 32:34.333
so we could start processing
runaways and changing records

32:34.417 --> 32:37.083
without anyone from Medlab
knowing about it.

32:37.167 --> 32:39.875
I trust my staff,
but the Psi Corps has a knack

32:39.958 --> 32:41.958
for intimidation.

32:42.042 --> 32:44.042
Look.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.667
In principle

32:45.750 --> 32:48.000
I agree with what you're doing.

32:48.083 --> 32:49.750
But there are laws.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.417
And whether I like 'em or not,
I'm a soldier.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.125
I am honor-bound
to obey the law!

32:54.208 --> 32:57.542
And as a doctor, I'm honor-bound
to help these people.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.958
So what am I supposed to do now?

33:00.042 --> 33:03.708
If I turn you in and right now,
I'm more than a little tempted..

33:03.792 --> 33:06.042
'...I embarrass the station,
Earth Central..'

33:06.125 --> 33:09.833
and give the folks back home
one more reason to shut us down.

33:12.375 --> 33:15.042
And if I don't turn you in..

33:15.125 --> 33:16.875
...I'm an accomplice.

33:16.958 --> 33:19.667
No. There's a third option.

33:20.417 --> 33:21.917
He's coming.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.833
[dramatic music]

33:43.833 --> 33:45.125
I remember you.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.250
And I remember you.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.708
That's why I started all this.

33:49.792 --> 33:50.875
Listen to me.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.583
You've nothing
to be afraid of.

33:54.667 --> 33:57.042
Come back with me.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.208
'You won't be harmed.'

33:59.292 --> 34:01.292
(Talia)
Of course, they will.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.625
Talia?

34:05.708 --> 34:09.500
You'll destroy them inch
by inch as a lesson to the rest.

34:09.583 --> 34:12.458
You wanna keep us
frightened and isolated.

34:12.542 --> 34:15.292
Not just from normals,
but from each other.

34:15.375 --> 34:18.000
That's the real reason
we wear gloves, isn't it?

34:18.083 --> 34:20.125
'To keep us apart?'

34:20.208 --> 34:22.333
But what happens
when the gloves come off?

34:25.125 --> 34:27.333
Don't force me to..

34:27.417 --> 34:30.500
[indistinct murmuring]

34:42.500 --> 34:44.042
It's not working.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.917
Someone is fighting us.

34:54.167 --> 34:56.417
- You!
- Now!

34:56.500 --> 34:57.583
[groans]

34:59.000 --> 35:02.042
[groaning]

35:21.958 --> 35:24.500
I'd have preferred
to take a few alive.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.833
What better to set an example.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.292
The main thing is,
the leader is gone.

35:29.375 --> 35:32.542
Cut off the head
and the body dies with it.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.375
You had me going
for a moment there.

35:37.458 --> 35:40.250
The corps is mother,
the corps is father.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.458
I know where my loyalties lie.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.417
I'm going back up now.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.292
Security will be here
within 20 minutes.

35:49.375 --> 35:51.208
I didn't want them asking
these people any questions

35:51.292 --> 35:54.417
and I don't wanna
answer any myself.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.333
I suggest you take
a different route back.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.417
We'll, of course,
deny all knowledge

35:59.500 --> 36:03.042
of this unfortunate incident.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.458
Of course.

36:21.375 --> 36:23.500
(Sheridan)
'I don't suppose
anyone would like to tell me'

36:23.583 --> 36:26.250
what just happened.

36:26.333 --> 36:27.625
What did you see?

36:29.458 --> 36:31.083
Bester came down the hallway

36:31.167 --> 36:32.833
he said something.

36:32.917 --> 36:35.500
Talia came out,
joined the others.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.583
Then he stopped.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.792
He stared for a moment.

36:40.875 --> 36:43.458
Then he smiled
and went back the way he came.

36:43.542 --> 36:46.792
- But that's not what he saw.
- Which was?

36:46.875 --> 36:49.917
He saw what
we wanted him to see.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.417
- An illusion?
- A telepathic projection.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.208
I thought Psi Cops were too
strong for that sort of thing.

36:56.292 --> 36:59.458
Individually, yes, any one of us
alone never could have done it.

36:59.542 --> 37:02.500
But together, we were able
to burrow past his defenses.

37:02.583 --> 37:04.708
Now, as far as
Bester's concerned

37:04.792 --> 37:07.250
the underground railroad
is dead, along with its leader.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.375
He won't press the issue because
he doesn't wanna be linked

37:09.458 --> 37:11.792
to a bunch of dead bodies.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.667
He'll go quietly.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.958
And all I have to do
is let him go.

37:16.042 --> 37:17.667
And avoid seeing him
before he goes.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.542
If he suspects anything,
he might scan you

37:19.625 --> 37:22.125
and you don't have
the defenses to block him.

37:22.208 --> 37:24.542
And no more
underground railroad?

37:24.625 --> 37:27.292
Babylon 5 has gotten
too hot for it.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.333
The others will pick up
where I left off.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.792
'My part's over.'

37:31.875 --> 37:34.417
Well, if there's nothing
illegal going on here

37:34.500 --> 37:40.167
anymore, and Mr. Bester
drops his request..

37:40.250 --> 37:41.542
...who am I to argue?

37:42.750 --> 37:44.083
You get your people out of here

37:44.167 --> 37:46.333
and I don't wanna see
any of them around here again.

37:46.417 --> 37:48.833
- Clear?
- Clear.

37:54.042 --> 37:55.125
[clears throat]

37:56.417 --> 37:57.625
Thanks.

37:57.708 --> 38:00.708
Don't thank me yet.
And get one thing straight.

38:00.792 --> 38:02.333
Anything like this
ever happens again

38:02.417 --> 38:04.125
I will personally turn you in

38:04.208 --> 38:05.958
and let them
hang you out to dry.

38:06.042 --> 38:07.125
Understood?

38:07.208 --> 38:08.750
So you don't think
that what I did was right?

38:08.833 --> 38:10.250
I didn't say that.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.958
Well, what are you saying?

38:12.042 --> 38:13.792
I'm not saying what I'm saying.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.167
I'm not saying
what I'm thinking.

38:16.250 --> 38:17.375
As a matter of fact

38:17.458 --> 38:19.417
I'm not thinking
what I'm thinking.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.042
There's only one thing
on my mind right now.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.875
What's that?

38:22.958 --> 38:26.042
- I need a drink.
- And a place to stay.

38:26.125 --> 38:27.417
Thanks, doc.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.667
I just about managed
to forget about that.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.417
(Lurker)
'You know,
you can't go back again.'

38:35.958 --> 38:38.000
I can't leave the corps.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.708
They'll come after me.

38:39.792 --> 38:41.583
No, I mean in here.

38:43.417 --> 38:45.000
You know too much.

38:45.083 --> 38:46.917
If Bester scans you, he'll..

38:49.417 --> 38:51.750
Can you keep him out?

38:51.833 --> 38:53.333
I think so.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.667
Jason's little gift.

38:56.750 --> 38:59.417
He gave you more than you know.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.792
What we did back there,
shouldn't have worked.

39:01.875 --> 39:03.792
Not with that Psi Cop.

39:06.042 --> 39:07.750
You tipped the balance.

39:09.833 --> 39:11.667
I felt it when we were joined.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.667
You are more
than you think you are.

39:18.250 --> 39:19.583
Then what am I?

39:21.542 --> 39:22.750
The future.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.542
Captain?

39:28.625 --> 39:30.417
I'd like to note two things
for the record.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.917
Yes, commander.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.875
Item one. I don't think
this protest is gonna work.

39:34.958 --> 39:37.042
And Earth Central never gives in
when it comes to money.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.292
But if you're determined
to keep at it..

39:39.375 --> 39:41.292
...I'm prepared to do the same.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.458
Item two.

39:43.542 --> 39:44.958
- You snore.
- No, I don't.

39:45.042 --> 39:46.625
- 'Yes, you do.'
- No, I don't.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.292
Captain, either you snore
or last night

39:48.375 --> 39:51.292
we had a hell of
a breach in the hull.

39:51.375 --> 39:53.583
- I get dibs on the couch.
- Unnecessary.

39:53.667 --> 39:55.625
You can sleep
in your own quarters tonight.

39:55.708 --> 39:57.500
Security has probably
unlocked them by now.

39:57.583 --> 39:59.708
- They gave in?
- 'Uh, no.'

40:00.542 --> 40:01.667
You gave in?

40:01.750 --> 40:02.833
Not exactly.

40:04.167 --> 40:05.875
I'm deducting
60 credits per week

40:05.958 --> 40:09.417
from the budget set aside
to maintain combat readiness

40:09.500 --> 40:11.167
and applying it
against the rent.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.792
On what grounds?

40:12.875 --> 40:14.458
On the grounds that I'm not
ready to fight anybody

40:14.542 --> 40:17.292
until I've had a decent night's
sleep in my own damn bed.

40:17.375 --> 40:20.417
- You got a problem with that?
- No, none whatsoever.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.625
I rather like the idea of Earth
Central paying rent to itself.

40:22.708 --> 40:24.833
It has a certain symmetry.

40:24.917 --> 40:26.167
[Sheridan laughs]

40:26.250 --> 40:27.708
Now, if you'll excuse me..

40:27.792 --> 40:29.667
..I think I'll go to
my quarters and collapse.

40:29.750 --> 40:32.333
Wonderful idea.
Dismissed, commander.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.125
Well, I'd better get back.

40:39.208 --> 40:41.583
There's always a mountain
of paperwork waiting for me.

40:41.667 --> 40:43.167
Mm-hmm.

40:43.250 --> 40:46.542
I hope you'll give some thought
to what I asked the other day.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.542
I was informed
that Sheridan would be

40:48.625 --> 40:50.000
supportive of the corps.

40:50.083 --> 40:52.667
I'm, I'm disappointed
by his attitude.

40:57.417 --> 41:00.750
You won't have a problem keeping
an eye on him, will you?

41:00.833 --> 41:03.917
No. No problem at all.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.167
Good. Well..

41:08.083 --> 41:10.375
See you next time, Ms. Winters.

41:12.958 --> 41:16.000
[dramatic music]

41:29.083 --> 41:30.542
[sighs]

41:32.625 --> 41:33.917
[sighs]

41:35.958 --> 41:37.250
Aah.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.458
[doorbell chimes]

41:40.542 --> 41:42.833
You're having far too much
fun at my expense.

41:46.167 --> 41:47.333
'Yes.'

41:49.375 --> 41:51.917
- I bring gifts.
- Ms. Winters, it's late.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.042
I know.

41:54.042 --> 41:55.375
I'm sorry.

41:58.833 --> 42:01.083
I just wanted to say
that you were right

42:01.167 --> 42:04.167
and I was wrong about the corps.

42:04.250 --> 42:06.833
I, um, I can't go into details

42:06.917 --> 42:08.333
but in light of recent events

42:08.417 --> 42:11.792
I think we need to re-evaluate
our relationship.

42:11.875 --> 42:14.750
Which is just
a, a formal way of saying

42:14.833 --> 42:18.208
that I need someone to talk to.

42:18.292 --> 42:20.792
And as strange as this sounds..

42:20.875 --> 42:22.583
...you're the only one
I can think of.

42:22.667 --> 42:25.917
'Unless my, my being here
offends you.'

42:26.000 --> 42:28.250
No, you don't offend me.

42:30.083 --> 42:31.250
But that does.

42:32.125 --> 42:35.167
[dramatic music]

42:44.833 --> 42:45.875
Better.

42:48.083 --> 42:51.125
[dramatic music]
