It's a jungle out there.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.417

00:37.061 --> 00:39.052
It's a jungle out there.

00:40.981 --> 00:43.946
Welcome back to 3AW Drive.
I'm Derryn Hinch.

00:43.981 --> 00:47.681
Recently you may have
heard the name Carl Williams

00:47.716 --> 00:51.346
in connection with
a $20 million amphetamine ring.

00:51.381 --> 00:54.601
In fact, police are calling him
the Mr Big of the drug trade.

00:54.636 --> 00:57.821
I have him on the line now.
Carl Williams, good afternoon.

00:57.856 --> 00:58.826
Good afternoon.

00:58.861 --> 01:01.481
What do you say in answer
to these very serious accusations?

01:01.516 --> 01:04.066
It's all a floor show, Derryn.
It's all... It's all corruption.

01:04.101 --> 01:06.741
It's... it's... it's all corruption
from everywhere in the police force.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.186
Wait a second.

01:08.221 --> 01:10.541
Exactly who are you accusing
of corruption?

01:10.576 --> 01:12.186
Hey, guys, listen to this.

01:12.221 --> 01:14.701
What we need here is a royal
commission. Everyone knows that.

01:14.736 --> 01:16.146
You stamp out one drug squad,

01:16.181 --> 01:17.946
you got another
corrupt drug squad in its place.

01:17.981 --> 01:20.506
It's the drug squad that's corrupt?
Goes right to the top.

01:20.541 --> 01:24.141
I know for a fact Detective Sergeant
Steve Owen of the Purana Taskforce

01:24.176 --> 01:27.061
has had regular dealings with
certain members of the drug squad

01:27.096 --> 01:29.581
who have since been arrested
on corruption charges.

01:29.616 --> 01:31.541
It's nothing but police corruption.

01:31.576 --> 01:32.986
Now, hang on.

01:33.021 --> 01:35.281
Let's be grown-up here.
Why did the police...

01:35.316 --> 01:37.541
Why did they pluck you
out of McDonald's?

01:37.576 --> 01:38.986
I mean, if you're a cleanskin?

01:39.021 --> 01:42.141
You tell me. You tell me.
I don't get involved in nothing.

01:42.176 --> 01:43.981
Well, they haven't come looking
for Mr Derryn Hinch.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.146
They've come looking
for Mr Carl Williams.

01:46.181 --> 01:49.661
Have you ever been involved
in trafficking drugs?

01:49.696 --> 01:52.226
Fuck, no! S'cuse my French.

01:52.261 --> 01:54.741
Oh, you shouldn't listen
to this rubbish, love.

01:54.776 --> 01:57.146
I couldn't live without Derryn.

01:57.181 --> 01:59.181
How do you,
Carl Williams, earn a quid?

01:59.216 --> 02:01.226
I'm a commissioner.
What?

02:01.261 --> 02:03.641
You're a what?
Wh-what did he just say?

02:03.676 --> 02:06.021
L-I... I earn commissions for people.

02:06.056 --> 02:07.786
Fucking idiot.

02:07.821 --> 02:09.265
What's a commission?

02:09.300 --> 02:12.401
Well, I have a bet. I have
a gamble on horses. So... I, um...

02:12.436 --> 02:15.501
You know, I sell jewellery.
I do a lot of odds and ends, Derryn.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.826
You get jewellery for people?

02:17.861 --> 02:19.946
What, do you steal it?
No, no, I don't steal.

02:19.981 --> 02:23.041
I'm not a thief.
I'm certainly not a thief, Derryn.

02:23.076 --> 02:26.101
Well, what do you mean,
you 'get' jewellery for people?

02:26.136 --> 02:28.466
Well, I have a friend
who's a wholesale jeweller,

02:28.501 --> 02:32.061
so if anyone wants necklaces or...
or gold jewellery, then I'II, um...

02:32.096 --> 02:35.621
<i>... I'll buy it for 'em at wholesale
and then sell it to them retail.</i>

02:35.656 --> 02:38.261
Ask him how he can afford
to buy a house for cash, Derryn.

02:38.296 --> 02:39.826
Go on, ask him.

02:39.861 --> 02:43.421
Mr Williams, more than
20 people have died

02:43.456 --> 02:46.101
in this so-called gangland war.

02:46.136 --> 02:47.786
Are you scared?

02:47.821 --> 02:50.026
I got nothing to be scared of.
I think it's...

02:50.061 --> 02:53.061
I think it's media things.
You know, I got no problems.

02:53.096 --> 02:56.061
Well, Andrew Veniamin.
Is he your bodyguard?

02:56.096 --> 02:59.066
Nah, Benji's a personal friend.

02:59.101 --> 03:01.401
It's like, you know,
if you're walking along the street

03:01.436 --> 03:03.701
and you're next to someone,
is that your bodyguard?

03:03.736 --> 03:05.738
Have you got life insurance, Carl?

03:05.773 --> 03:08.395
No, I don't have no life insurance.

03:08.430 --> 03:11.017
Well, I recommend you get some.

03:14.181 --> 03:16.615
Haven't you people
got any work to do?

03:17.861 --> 03:21.181
That was Carl Williams.
I'm Derryn Hinch. And that's life.

03:21.216 --> 03:24.501
Tell her to tell them that you've
got our total support.

03:24.536 --> 03:26.986
Because you're corrupt too?
What?

03:27.021 --> 03:29.146
That's what they'll say.
Look, some mud is gonna stick.

03:29.181 --> 03:32.161
That's inevitable. You've just
got to work through it, Steve.

03:32.196 --> 03:34.928
How's Operation Gatto coming along?
Yeah, fine. Ready to roll.

03:34.963 --> 03:37.612
Actually, I'd prefer it if you let
Bubba and Jacqui run it.

03:37.647 --> 03:40.226
What, so you can spend more time
harassing Carl Williams?

03:40.261 --> 03:43.061
I'd prefer it if you got
Mick Gatto off the streets first.

03:43.096 --> 03:45.861
Mick Gatto
was the highest-profile member

03:45.896 --> 03:47.346
of the Carlton Crew.

03:47.381 --> 03:50.661
Our plan was simple -
use every means at our disposal

03:50.696 --> 03:53.221
to get him behind bars
and out of harm's way,

03:53.256 --> 03:55.426
away from Carl Williams's guns.

03:55.461 --> 03:58.186
It's time we drew
a line in the sand.

03:58.221 --> 04:01.101
If we don't stop the prick now,
he'll run this town.

04:01.136 --> 04:03.938
Already runs it.
Missed that boat.

04:03.973 --> 04:06.740
Pick up your guts, Lewis.

04:08.261 --> 04:09.694
I've lost two sons.

04:12.101 --> 04:15.026
Well, do something about it.

04:15.061 --> 04:16.821
Why don't you do something
about it?

04:16.856 --> 04:18.732
I'm the money man.

04:24.381 --> 04:27.181
About time he started punching
his weight for a change, I reckon.

04:27.216 --> 04:28.146
Mick.

04:28.181 --> 04:31.461
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I'm not calling him gutless.

04:31.496 --> 04:32.906
Course not.

04:32.941 --> 04:35.581
We're talking about the fella
who went the distance

04:35.616 --> 04:38.221
with the heavyweight champion
of New South Wales.

04:38.256 --> 04:39.256
Twice.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.701
This is all partly his fault,
you know.

04:46.736 --> 04:48.026
This war.

04:48.061 --> 04:51.101
Well, who brought Benji into
the crew in the first place?

04:51.136 --> 04:52.586
Mick.

04:52.621 --> 04:55.374
Now he's Carl's
number one attack dog.

04:58.061 --> 05:00.901
Mick's record
as a heavyweight boxer

05:00.936 --> 05:03.741
wasn't the greatest -
nine fights for five wins.

05:03.776 --> 05:06.066
But he did learn
a few valuable lessons.

05:06.101 --> 05:08.586
Never let your opponent
know when you're hurt,

05:08.621 --> 05:13.741
never throw a punch in anger
and never, never, never blink.

05:13.776 --> 05:15.706
Yeah, who's there?
Can you state your business?

05:15.741 --> 05:18.861
Mr Gatto, these gentlemen are with
the Australian Crime Commission.

05:18.896 --> 05:20.986
Gareth Forrester, Mr Gatto.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.266
Got a warrant here
to search these premises

05:23.301 --> 05:26.101
and seize such items as might
assist us with our investigation.

05:26.136 --> 05:27.778
And what am I being
investigated for?

05:27.813 --> 05:29.421
A whole range of
criminal activities.

05:29.456 --> 05:30.854
It's all in the document.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.021
Mr, um?

05:34.056 --> 05:35.466
Forrester.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.941
There's a gentlemanly way
to do things,

05:37.976 --> 05:39.946
and then there's the wrong way.

05:39.981 --> 05:42.661
You turning up here at
seven o'clock in the morning,

05:42.696 --> 05:46.226
disturbing my family,
that's the wrong way.

05:46.261 --> 05:49.101
Step aside, please, Mr Gatto.
Just give us 30 minutes.

05:49.136 --> 05:50.981
We'll have our showers,
a little coffee.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.812
And dispose of the evidence?

05:57.261 --> 05:59.906
Alright. 30 minutes.

05:59.941 --> 06:03.421
Provided, of course, I can come in
and keep an eye on you.

06:03.456 --> 06:04.854
You'll be my guest.

06:09.061 --> 06:10.801
Is that the only computer,
Mr Gatto?

06:10.836 --> 06:12.541
Yeah, there's one
in the boy's room.

06:12.576 --> 06:14.213
Check that out, would you?

06:16.781 --> 06:19.534
You make sure to tell me if he's
been looking at any porn, alright?

06:20.941 --> 06:23.011
So is this your idea?

06:24.301 --> 06:25.786
Or theirs?

06:25.821 --> 06:28.201
We believe it's for
your own good, Mr Gatto.

06:28.236 --> 06:30.581
You see, every time
we draw up a hit list,

06:30.616 --> 06:32.186
your name seems to be
at the top.

06:32.221 --> 06:34.981
We think it's harder to kill you
when you're in jail.

06:35.016 --> 06:37.478
I don't need your protection, champ.

06:37.513 --> 06:39.941
You gotta be
top of the list, old mate.

06:39.976 --> 06:41.386
Scare tactics.

06:41.421 --> 06:45.081
It's the oldest strategy
in the world, divide and conquer.

06:45.116 --> 06:48.388
Well, I advise keep a low profile.
Take a long holiday.

06:48.423 --> 06:51.661
What do I look like, an invalid?
Can't take care of myself?

06:51.696 --> 06:53.811
Mark and Jason thought
they were bulletproof too.

06:56.101 --> 06:59.226
No, run and hide -
that's not my style.

06:59.261 --> 07:03.981
Well, in that case,
you confront the threat head-on.

07:04.016 --> 07:06.498
Mr Dominic Gatto?
Who wants him?

07:06.533 --> 07:08.981
The Australian Taxation Office.

07:09.016 --> 07:11.654
Barbarians at the gate.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.706
What can I do for you?

07:17.741 --> 07:20.946
According to ATO records,
Mr Gatto,

07:20.981 --> 07:24.781
you haven't filed a tax return
since 1989.

07:24.816 --> 07:26.426
Is this an appropriate venue?

07:26.461 --> 07:28.850
This is where you conduct
all your business.

07:30.181 --> 07:32.501
Look, I could have
taken my eye off the ball,

07:32.536 --> 07:34.061
forgotten the odd tax return or two.

07:34.096 --> 07:35.626
I've been busy.

07:35.661 --> 07:40.541
Since the sources of your income
were difficult to trace,

07:40.576 --> 07:43.778
we undertook an audit of your assets
and lifestyle.

07:43.813 --> 07:46.981
We calculated your taxable income
on their value.

07:47.016 --> 07:48.666
What assets
are you talking about?

07:48.701 --> 07:52.181
Your home in Doncaster,
holiday house in Sorrento,

07:52.216 --> 07:54.066
two investment properties
in Richmond,

07:54.101 --> 07:57.461
your share of
a crane and scaffolding business

07:57.496 --> 07:59.426
operating out of Laverton.

07:59.461 --> 08:02.866
It's all in here.
Happy reading.

08:02.901 --> 08:11.252
The bottom line is
that you owe us $1,204,648.

08:16.981 --> 08:20.461
Come on, fatso. Come on, up on
your elbows. That's hopeless!

08:20.496 --> 08:22.278
Come on!

08:22.313 --> 08:24.026
Fuck!

08:24.061 --> 08:26.026
Alright, now, turn around.
Oh, fuck off.

08:26.061 --> 08:28.861
Hey, listen, fatso, you want to
lose the gut, you gotta do the work.

08:28.896 --> 08:31.261
I'm thinking it's time
we made a move on the big guy.

08:31.296 --> 08:33.251
Who?
You know who.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.106
Gatto.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.241
Nuh, you find someone else.

08:38.275 --> 08:40.306
I can't touch him. He's a mate.

08:40.341 --> 08:44.061
Benj, you're like family now.
We open up our hearts to you.

08:44.096 --> 08:46.746
You owe me Mick Gatto.

08:46.781 --> 08:49.421
It's like asking me
to murder my father.

08:49.456 --> 08:51.746
You whacked your best mate Dino.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.821
Why can't you whack some
big ugly knob like Gatto?

08:53.856 --> 08:56.141
Listen to me, alright?
It's about respect.

08:56.176 --> 08:58.177
Whose side you on, Benj?

09:15.461 --> 09:17.066
I didn't order a salad.

09:17.101 --> 09:19.901
No, you never do.
But you should.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.626
Take it back.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.746
Do you want parmesan?

09:23.781 --> 09:27.217
I can already feel this
doing me good.

09:29.701 --> 09:32.981
Mick, you know how
Benji borrowed my car?

09:33.016 --> 09:34.778
It was a few months back.

09:34.813 --> 09:36.506
He still hasn't returned it.

09:36.541 --> 09:40.066
I'll talk to him
first chance I get.

09:40.101 --> 09:42.740
Hey, Mick, Mick.
Can I help you guys or what?

09:45.301 --> 09:47.257
Here to see Mick Gatto.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.626
So who are you?

09:54.661 --> 09:56.617
My name's Sean. This is Michael.

09:58.101 --> 09:59.659
Carl Williams says hello.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.466
I'm his cousin.

10:03.501 --> 10:05.346
Well, congratulations.

10:05.381 --> 10:06.973
That must be a thrill for you.

10:08.701 --> 10:10.866
So is that it? 'Hello' or?

10:10.901 --> 10:13.706
Somewhere we can talk
in private, Mick?

10:13.741 --> 10:17.051
Talk right here. Just say whatever
you want to say, then piss off.

10:24.621 --> 10:28.057
Carl wants you to know he's
got no plans to hurt the Munster.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.581
Mate, who would want to waste
a bullet on me? Who am I a threat to?

10:54.616 --> 10:56.026
Nah.

10:56.061 --> 10:58.450
They're just trying
to put the wind up us.

11:17.701 --> 11:20.097
You know how to use it?

11:20.132 --> 11:22.494
I don't need a gun.

11:24.341 --> 11:25.854
You want a demo?

11:28.501 --> 11:33.541
I was carrying one of these when
you were still pooing in your nappy.

11:33.576 --> 11:35.386
Well, maybe you're right.

11:35.421 --> 11:38.381
Maybe it is me that they're after.

11:38.416 --> 11:39.906
But...

11:39.941 --> 11:42.906
Well, in that case...

11:42.941 --> 11:45.141
...we'll drink to YOUR health.

11:46.221 --> 11:48.021
Merry Christmas.

11:48.056 --> 11:49.500
Salute.

11:50.701 --> 11:53.381
Come on, you fat pig.

11:53.416 --> 11:54.814
Get up there!

11:55.941 --> 11:58.359
You are hopeless, Carl.
Oh! Piss off.

11:58.394 --> 12:00.778
Totally hopeless.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.412
Shockin', mate.

12:11.741 --> 12:13.186
Who is it?

12:13.221 --> 12:16.293
Hey? Uh, it's private, mate.

12:18.461 --> 12:20.141
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Andrew!

12:20.176 --> 12:21.586
Hey, thanks for stopping by.

12:21.621 --> 12:23.106
Appreciate it.
Don't mention it.

12:23.141 --> 12:24.986
Haven't seen much of you, champ.
What's going on?

12:25.021 --> 12:27.021
You know, commitments, mate.
You know what it's like, eh?

12:27.056 --> 12:28.901
So, have you got a minute
for a chat?

12:28.936 --> 12:30.706
Yeah, sure.
60 seconds, tops.

12:30.741 --> 12:32.306
And then we'll have
a coffee, alright?

12:32.341 --> 12:34.461
We'll just retire to the boardroom.
OK.

12:34.496 --> 12:36.538
We'll wait for you here.
Yeah.

12:36.573 --> 12:38.581
I'm worried about you, champ.

12:38.616 --> 12:40.066
Me? What? I'm fine.

12:40.101 --> 12:42.501
I hear that you're spending
a lot of time with Carl Williams.

12:42.536 --> 12:44.186
Look.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.821
Sometimes I spend time with you,
sometimes I spend time with him.

12:46.856 --> 12:48.746
You know...
I know a lot of people.

12:48.781 --> 12:51.959
You're a special person, Andrew.
You've got special gifts.

12:51.994 --> 12:55.137
And I hate to see you wasting them.
Don't worry about me.

12:57.181 --> 12:59.021
Into a lot of gear?

12:59.056 --> 13:00.454
No.

13:01.861 --> 13:03.306
No.

13:03.341 --> 13:06.381
You just remember what happens
to guys who do do a lot of that shit.

13:06.416 --> 13:08.941
Listen, I got it under control.

13:11.661 --> 13:13.186
Andrew, I don't want to hear

13:13.221 --> 13:15.821
that you're running
with the Williams crew.

13:15.856 --> 13:18.141
That's not healthy.

13:18.176 --> 13:19.779
Think it over.

13:21.461 --> 13:22.894
Think it over.

13:24.541 --> 13:26.338
Come here. Come here.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.214
What are you thinking about?

13:38.661 --> 13:40.652
Jesus Christ on the cross.

13:43.101 --> 13:47.094
What do you reckon it feels like
to get spikes nailed through your hands?

13:49.781 --> 13:51.506
Nuh, kidding.

13:51.541 --> 13:53.501
I'm thinking about
what a beautiful back you got.

13:53.536 --> 13:54.946
Ooh.

13:54.981 --> 13:57.051
Ooh. Ooh.

13:58.741 --> 14:00.186
Lower.

14:00.221 --> 14:02.139
What a beautiful back you got!

14:02.174 --> 14:04.057
Youse want anything from the bar?

14:05.101 --> 14:07.201
Um, Bundy and Coke.

14:07.236 --> 14:09.301
Yeah, ouzo straight up.

14:09.336 --> 14:11.106
It'll cost ya.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.133
Everything's got a price, Benj.
Remember that.

14:20.421 --> 14:21.854
What's up his arse?

14:25.181 --> 14:26.701
You two having a blue?

14:26.736 --> 14:28.257
Nah, we're cool.

14:28.292 --> 14:29.779
Yeah, sure you are.

14:31.341 --> 14:32.906
Hey, you see this?

14:32.941 --> 14:35.141
Yeah, I thought that was new.

14:35.176 --> 14:37.458
It's pretty.

14:37.493 --> 14:39.517
And look.

14:39.552 --> 14:41.541
Guess who.

14:45.181 --> 14:47.541
You got me hanging
around your neck.

14:47.576 --> 14:49.975
You only get one soul mate.

14:52.861 --> 14:54.294
I love you, Benj.

16:25.221 --> 16:28.461
Have a good day, love?
Pretty good.

16:28.496 --> 16:30.786
You?
Yeah. Sis rang.

16:30.821 --> 16:32.941
They're coming for Christmas dinner
after all.

16:32.976 --> 16:34.546
Oh. Good-o.

16:34.581 --> 16:36.066
More the merrier.

16:36.101 --> 16:38.061
Is that pork chops I can smell?

16:38.096 --> 16:40.741
Yes, and roast vegies.

16:40.776 --> 16:42.652
Mm-hm.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.021
Graham, what's the matter?

16:46.056 --> 16:48.386
Nothing, love.

16:48.421 --> 16:51.021
Don't scare me.
You're worried about something.

16:51.056 --> 16:55.221
I haven't got a worry in the world.

16:55.256 --> 16:57.581
You are worried. I can tell.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.106
Sybil, I'm not worried.

17:00.141 --> 17:03.226
Pull your head in.
Read your bloody book.

17:03.261 --> 17:06.252
30 years of marriage,
I can read YOU like a bloody book.

17:11.141 --> 17:13.021
Can I do anything to help?

17:17.141 --> 17:19.026
I love you very much.

17:19.060 --> 17:21.858
Tell me what I can do to help.

17:26.221 --> 17:29.701
Keep the home fires burning.
That's what I'd like you to do.

17:29.736 --> 17:32.499
'Cause nobody does it better.

17:45.021 --> 17:47.221
Uh, we got any ice-cream?
Choc-chip?

17:47.256 --> 17:49.906
What about your cholesterol?

17:49.941 --> 17:52.901
Sybil, have we got
any ice-cream or not?

17:52.936 --> 17:56.291
Yes or no?
No.

17:59.261 --> 18:01.181
I'm hopping out.

18:42.781 --> 18:44.226
Hello?

18:44.261 --> 18:47.101
Hello, Mick.
It's Sybil Kinniburgh here.

18:47.136 --> 18:48.693
Hey.

18:49.821 --> 18:52.261
Graham's dead, Mick.

18:52.296 --> 18:54.106
Murdered.

18:54.141 --> 18:55.786
He went out for ice-cream.

18:55.821 --> 18:59.018
They killed him when he went out
for choc-chip ice-cream.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.906
It has to be Benji Veniamin,
doesn't it?

19:14.941 --> 19:17.066
Well, the MO's about right.
The shooter was on foot.

19:17.101 --> 19:20.021
Waited for Kinniburgh to get home,
couple of bullets in him,

19:20.056 --> 19:21.666
took off in a waiting vehicle.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.498
Yeah, 2-man team, as per usual.

19:29.381 --> 19:32.817
My condolences.
I know Mr Kinniburgh was a good friend.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.186
He was my best friend.

19:36.221 --> 19:39.421
Just for the record, what was
Mr Kinniburgh's line of work?

19:39.456 --> 19:41.332
He was a rigger.

19:43.661 --> 19:46.146
Can you shed any light
on the matter, Mr Gatto?

19:46.181 --> 19:48.854
Well, I wish I could, but I can't.
Did he have any enemies?

19:50.621 --> 19:53.266
He was widely liked.

19:53.301 --> 19:56.186
Well-respected in the community.

19:56.221 --> 19:58.186
And I wouldn't know anyone
who'd want to hurt him.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.941
Yes, but surely you must have
your suspicions. I mean, we do.

20:00.976 --> 20:03.578
Then why are you bothering me?
Come on, Mick.

20:03.613 --> 20:06.181
How are we supposed to
shut these blokes down

20:06.216 --> 20:07.853
if you don't tell us
what you know?

20:09.021 --> 20:10.454
Are we done?

20:12.621 --> 20:14.134
Oh, this is bloody useless.

20:23.301 --> 20:25.621
I don't want you
sorting this out yourself.

20:25.656 --> 20:28.499
We'll deal with it. Understand?

20:32.301 --> 20:35.261
Yeah, I'd like
to place a death notice.

20:35.296 --> 20:39.621
"Kinniburgh. Graham.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.089
"The Munster.

20:44.261 --> 20:46.906
"Tragically taken.

20:46.941 --> 20:52.538
"Words cannot express
the way that I feel right now.

20:53.821 --> 20:57.211
"You were my lifelong friend.

20:58.461 --> 21:01.021
"And I was so proud
to be part of your life.

21:02.941 --> 21:07.969
"This has left a void in my life
that cannot be replaced.

21:10.501 --> 21:12.219
"I love you, Pa.

21:13.381 --> 21:18.580
"And I will never, ever forget you."

21:44.621 --> 21:46.180
Why him?

21:46.215 --> 21:47.739
Why Graham?

21:49.701 --> 21:51.666
Why not me, you mean.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.701
You could have prevented this, Mick.

21:53.736 --> 21:55.146
All you had to do

21:55.181 --> 21:57.421
was take that little tattooed
prick mate of yours in hand.

21:57.456 --> 21:59.506
We all know who did it.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.657
What are you gonna do about him?

22:22.421 --> 22:23.934
Hello.

22:25.021 --> 22:26.466
Hey?

22:26.501 --> 22:27.981
Hey, buddy, what's doing?

22:28.016 --> 22:29.461
Yep. Yeah, righto.

22:29.496 --> 22:30.940
Hey, fatso!

22:36.141 --> 22:37.466
It's Mick.

22:37.501 --> 22:39.651
Mick?
Yeah, he wants to talk to you.

22:42.101 --> 22:43.534
G'day, Mick.

22:45.061 --> 22:46.506
Powwow?

22:46.541 --> 22:48.586
Gee, Mick, I dunno.

22:48.621 --> 22:52.057
I get pretty nervous when strange men
invite me to private powwows.

22:54.901 --> 22:56.493
Yeah, alright. I'll see you there.

22:57.861 --> 22:59.986
So where are you meeting him?
Just at a pub.

23:00.021 --> 23:02.061
Where are my bloody keys?
You got my bloody keys?

23:02.096 --> 23:04.021
Don't get in a fucking
tizzy with me, toad.

23:04.056 --> 23:05.466
Haven't seen you this nervous

23:05.501 --> 23:07.466
since you were off to see
Jason and Mark Moran.

23:07.501 --> 23:10.301
Yeah, and look what fucking happened.
I got an extra navel in my belly.

23:10.336 --> 23:11.734
Hey.
Wish me luck.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.106
See ya.

23:16.141 --> 23:17.654
Yeah. It'll be alright.

23:26.101 --> 23:27.580
Mick.

23:29.621 --> 23:31.054
Carl.

23:34.061 --> 23:36.131
Beer?
Yeah, sure. Why not?

23:39.821 --> 23:41.421
Speccy weather at the moment,
isn't it?

23:41.456 --> 23:42.979
Just cut to the chase.

23:45.101 --> 23:48.650
A lot of shit's been going on,
and you've had a big hand in it.

23:49.821 --> 23:51.732
Sorry I'm late.
I was parking the car.

23:53.661 --> 23:55.901
He's driving me.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.016
Andrew.

23:59.381 --> 24:03.181
A lot of shit's been going on,
and you've had a big hand in it.

24:03.216 --> 24:04.986
Both of you.
Mate, we've had nothing...

24:05.021 --> 24:07.261
Don't interrupt, 'cause I'm not
gonna argue the toss with you.

24:07.296 --> 24:08.506
'Cause right now,

24:08.541 --> 24:13.781
I don't care why this bloke
or that bloke had to be knocked.

24:13.816 --> 24:16.461
What I care about...
My condolences about the Munster.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.958
He was a top bloke.
You just shut up.

24:19.993 --> 24:23.421
You are not even fit
to mention his name.

24:23.456 --> 24:26.379
You put your guns away.

24:27.781 --> 24:29.214
You hearing me, Andrew?

24:32.221 --> 24:33.973
Mate, it's over.

25:21.701 --> 25:24.056
He says he wants us to move on.

25:25.181 --> 25:27.979
But does he mean it?
Is he just setting me up?

25:29.541 --> 25:31.141
What do you think, Benji?

25:31.176 --> 25:33.371
Benji!

25:37.621 --> 25:41.136
You know Mick better than me.
You know Mick better than anyone.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.941
Mick don't take shit
from no-one, Carl.

25:45.976 --> 25:47.906
That includes you.

25:47.941 --> 25:50.330
What's that supposed to mean?

25:51.861 --> 25:53.626
He's gonna kill you, man.

25:53.661 --> 25:56.050
I mean, unless you kill him first.

26:24.621 --> 26:26.426
Hello?

26:26.461 --> 26:29.301
Well, you gonna wish me
a happy birthday?

26:29.336 --> 26:32.141
Hey, Roberta.
Happy birthday.

26:32.176 --> 26:33.786
Guess what I'm doing.

26:33.821 --> 26:36.779
I'm having a bath
in French fuckin' champagne.

26:39.741 --> 26:41.561
You got a prezzie for me?

26:41.596 --> 26:43.346
Yeah, of course I have, babe.

26:43.381 --> 26:44.981
Am I ever gonna
see your face again?

26:45.016 --> 26:46.501
You just try and stop me.

26:46.536 --> 26:47.946
No, the song.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.861
# Am I ever gonna
see ya face again?

26:50.896 --> 26:52.306
# No way, get... #

26:52.341 --> 26:54.218
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

26:56.381 --> 26:57.780
And, Benj...

27:00.101 --> 27:01.773
I love you.

27:05.221 --> 27:06.700
I know.

27:15.781 --> 27:17.946
You off to work?
Uh, yeah.

27:17.981 --> 27:19.901
You want something
to eat first, or?

27:19.936 --> 27:22.051
No, Pa, I'm fine.

27:23.181 --> 27:24.661
You be careful, huh?

27:24.696 --> 27:26.834
Yeah.

27:26.869 --> 27:28.972
Andrew.

27:31.621 --> 27:33.259
Come here.

27:37.021 --> 27:37.976
Hmm?

27:55.901 --> 27:58.181
G'day, Mick.
G'day, Mick.

27:58.216 --> 28:00.426
Anything you want done today?

28:00.461 --> 28:02.417
Just be on standby in case
anything comes up, yeah?

28:10.581 --> 28:12.061
Oh, thanks for coming.

28:12.096 --> 28:13.666
Take a seat.

28:13.701 --> 28:17.461
You have a cheque for us

28:17.496 --> 28:20.638
in the amount of $1,204,648?

28:20.673 --> 28:23.781
You know, I can read tea-leaves.

28:23.816 --> 28:25.466
I can foretell the future.

28:25.501 --> 28:29.666
And if I choose to contest
this number 1-2-0-4-6-4-8,

28:29.701 --> 28:33.221
we are going to spend a lot of time
in court together, you and me.

28:33.256 --> 28:35.341
You'd lose and pay costs.

28:35.376 --> 28:36.826
But if I win,

28:36.861 --> 28:40.901
it will cost the taxpayer
more than $1.2 million.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.096
So you want to hear
my counteroffer?

28:44.701 --> 28:47.301
I agree that I have to
pay you some money.

28:47.336 --> 28:48.973
That is only fair and just.

28:50.141 --> 28:54.941
There is $200,000 there,
and it's all yours if you rip that up.

28:54.976 --> 28:57.301
So why don't you go back
to your masters

28:57.336 --> 29:00.099
and you tell 'em the situation?

29:02.621 --> 29:04.418
'Cause I got a busy day
ahead of me.

30:28.821 --> 30:30.266
Sit, sit, sit.

30:30.301 --> 30:32.941
Giovanni! A peppermint tea and...
What do you want? What do you want?

30:32.976 --> 30:36.901
Uh, normal cappuccino.
Don't make it too strong.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.778
Sit down, sit down. Sit down.

30:41.221 --> 30:43.860
So, what's with the peppermint tea?

30:51.381 --> 30:52.826
How's me old mate doing?

30:52.861 --> 30:56.786
Ronnie? Oh, he's going real well.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.301
Yeah, he looks...
Iooks fucking real good.

30:59.336 --> 31:01.266
Yeah, he looks terrific.

31:01.301 --> 31:03.818
But he's gonna have an X-ray soon.

31:03.853 --> 31:06.335
See what the cancer looks like.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.778
So why have you been
avoiding me, champ? Hmm?

31:21.181 --> 31:23.979
Mick, who's avoiding you?

31:25.261 --> 31:27.138
Here I am.

31:28.541 --> 31:30.259
You... you want a chat?

31:34.741 --> 31:36.174
Yeah, I do.

32:23.941 --> 32:26.821
Fuck you!

32:31.781 --> 32:34.781
Giovanni. There's been some trouble.

32:34.816 --> 32:36.931
I just shot Andrew Veniamin.

32:40.941 --> 32:43.981
He's dead. Call the police.

32:44.016 --> 32:45.146
Fuck!

32:45.181 --> 32:46.899
Call the police.

33:17.181 --> 33:19.346
I keep hearing that you think
that I killed Graham.

33:19.381 --> 33:22.221
Well, Andrew, to be honest with you,
mate, that's what I keep hearing.

33:22.256 --> 33:24.661
Mick, why would I fuck with you?
You're a mate of mine.

33:24.696 --> 33:27.106
Dino Dibra. Paul Kallipolitis.
Yeah...

33:27.141 --> 33:28.861
They were your mates...
They fucking deserved it!

33:28.896 --> 33:30.533
They were dogs.

33:59.661 --> 34:01.106
Good afternoon.

34:01.141 --> 34:03.341
As you would have just heard,
there seems to have been

34:03.376 --> 34:05.381
another gangland slaying
here in Melbourne.

34:05.416 --> 34:07.478
That has to be
either 22 or number 23.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.505
According to the news that's just in,

34:09.541 --> 34:13.501
a man has been shot dead in the
inner Melbourne suburb of Carlton.

34:13.536 --> 34:15.545
Ambulance Service spokesman
James Howe

34:15.581 --> 34:19.065
says they received a call
to attend the scene of a shooting

34:19.101 --> 34:22.860
near the corner of Faraday and
Rathdowne streets just before 3pm.

34:22.896 --> 34:25.237
The man was dead
when paramedics arrived.

34:25.273 --> 34:27.581
It happened outside
La Porcella restaurant.

34:27.616 --> 34:29.505
Sounds like something

34:29.541 --> 34:31.821
out of the Mafia days
in New York City, doesn't it?

34:31.856 --> 34:33.906
As I understand it, um...

34:33.940 --> 34:37.661
As I understand it, uh, the...
the man who is dead, we have a name.

34:37.696 --> 34:39.746
We can't confirm it yet,

34:39.781 --> 34:43.860
but the man who is dead is
an associate of Carl Williams.

34:43.896 --> 34:45.797
We go straight now,
on that shooting,

34:45.833 --> 34:47.666
to Aaron Young,
through to a news report.

34:47.701 --> 34:49.821
Aaron, good afternoon.
Good afternoon to you, Derryn.

34:49.856 --> 34:51.413
Oi, Owen!

34:56.101 --> 34:58.490
I heard there was a shooting.
What happened?

35:00.501 --> 35:02.059
Andrew Veniamin's been shot.

35:03.621 --> 35:05.746
Dead?

35:05.781 --> 35:08.454
Who did it?

35:10.061 --> 35:11.494
Who did it?

35:15.301 --> 35:17.581
Oh, Jesus, it's Mick Gatto.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.254
Oh, fuck.

35:38.501 --> 35:39.980
And what happened next?

35:44.621 --> 35:48.461
I said, um, "Dino Dibra and
Paul Kallipolitis were your mates,

35:48.496 --> 35:50.626
"but you fucking killed them."

35:50.661 --> 35:52.906
He said they deserved it,
they were dogs.

35:52.941 --> 35:56.821
And I'm looking him in the eyes,
and his face goes kind of funny,

35:56.856 --> 35:58.306
he takes a step back,

35:58.341 --> 36:01.321
and he says,
"We had to kill Graham, but...

36:01.356 --> 36:04.301
"We had to kill fucking Graham.
Fuck him.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.746
"And fuck you."

36:05.781 --> 36:08.781
And I never seen where he got it from,
but he pulled out a gun,

36:08.816 --> 36:11.301
and that's when I lunged,
and I grabbed his arm.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.850
Grabbed his arm with my hand.

36:16.101 --> 36:18.301
And then the gun went off
past my head.

36:19.301 --> 36:23.141
Grabbed his hands with both my hands
and pushed his hands,

36:23.176 --> 36:24.946
'cause his hands
were still on the trigger.

36:24.981 --> 36:28.101
And I squeezed his hands,
forced him to pull the trigger.

36:28.136 --> 36:30.866
And then it was just bang, bang.

36:30.901 --> 36:33.779
And I don't remember
where it went or whatever.

36:36.381 --> 36:37.973
So what happens now?

36:39.301 --> 36:41.866
We'll swab you for gunshot residue,

36:41.901 --> 36:43.861
take your photograph,
your fingerprints

36:43.896 --> 36:45.374
and remand you into custody.

36:48.861 --> 36:51.026
Mr Veniamin?

36:51.061 --> 36:54.301
Detectives James and Owen,
Purana Taskforce.

36:54.336 --> 36:56.866
Sir, I've got
some bad news for you.

36:56.901 --> 36:59.501
Your son Andrew was shot dead
this afternoon.

36:59.536 --> 37:03.733
May we call someone for you?

37:05.741 --> 37:09.301
Mr Veniamin, do you understand?

37:09.336 --> 37:11.610
Andrew is dead?

37:22.941 --> 37:25.455
Thank you. I understand.

37:29.501 --> 37:30.980
Yes, boss?

37:33.341 --> 37:34.933
Are they sure?

37:36.741 --> 37:38.174
Alright, thanks.

37:40.621 --> 37:42.581
The transcribers have been
working through

37:42.616 --> 37:44.706
the listening device backlog.

37:44.741 --> 37:46.386
Guess who was home
safe and sound

37:46.421 --> 37:47.901
watching Christmas carols
with Mum and Dad

37:47.936 --> 37:49.334
the night Kinniburgh was shot.

37:50.741 --> 37:51.776
Benji.

37:55.381 --> 37:57.386
Who the hell was it, then?

37:57.421 --> 38:00.299
I thought that was one file
we could put away.

38:03.381 --> 38:06.461
You've lost
someone important to you.

38:06.496 --> 38:09.101
A relative or close friend.

38:09.136 --> 38:11.781
Very close friend.

38:11.816 --> 38:13.386
Very close.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.458
Do you have something
belonging to this departed one?

38:26.821 --> 38:33.061
I have a strong sense of a man
trying to make contact.

38:33.096 --> 38:36.101
Yeah. He's a man.
Can you see him?

38:36.136 --> 38:38.258
I'm getting a message.

38:38.293 --> 38:40.452
I can see a letter.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.611
The letter 'S'.

38:43.821 --> 38:47.701
Think hard. It's important.
He's being pulled away from us.

38:47.736 --> 38:49.741
Sunshine. He grew up in Sunshine.

38:49.776 --> 38:51.186
Yes!

38:51.221 --> 38:57.581
Yes, I can see the sun shining,
shining all around him like...

38:57.616 --> 38:59.597
<i>... like a halo.</i>

38:59.632 --> 39:01.579
What's his name?

39:03.821 --> 39:06.461
Benji.
That's right.

39:06.496 --> 39:07.946
Benjamin.

39:07.981 --> 39:10.541
No, um, we called him Benji,
but his name's Andrew.

39:10.576 --> 39:12.666
Correct.

39:12.701 --> 39:18.541
He wants you to know
he's looking over you.

39:18.576 --> 39:23.021
Benji's looking after you, Roberta.

39:24.701 --> 39:26.421
Tell him I love him.

39:26.456 --> 39:27.866
He knows.

39:27.901 --> 39:31.157
Oh, my word, yes, he knows.

39:31.192 --> 39:34.413
And he wants you to know...

39:36.741 --> 39:41.371
<i>... that he loves you
with all of his heart.</i>

39:51.821 --> 39:53.666
The Deputy Commissioner says

39:53.701 --> 39:56.581
you're a prime target in the
gangland war, Carl Williams.

39:56.616 --> 39:58.026
What do you say to that?

39:58.061 --> 39:59.699
I haven't got any enemies, Derryn.

40:01.461 --> 40:04.021
Do you have any message
for Andrew Veniamin's killer?

40:05.101 --> 40:08.537
If anyone wants to
come get me, come get me.

40:09.981 --> 40:11.573
Just don't miss.

40:21.141 --> 40:25.626
On June 15, 2005,
after eight hours deliberation,

40:25.661 --> 40:29.701
a supreme court jury rejected
the Crown's case against Mick Gatto.

40:29.736 --> 40:33.741
He was found not guilty of murdering
Andrew Veniamin, and acquitted.

40:33.776 --> 40:36.106
Gatto's solicitor, Brian Rolfe,

40:36.141 --> 40:39.981
said the prosecution case
was based on theory, not facts.

40:40.016 --> 40:42.386
The prosecution
could never establish

40:42.421 --> 40:45.661
that Andrew Veniamin did not
bring the gun to the restaurant.

40:45.696 --> 40:47.746
"Thank God for the jury system,

40:47.781 --> 40:51.026
"and thank God for my barrister,
Robert Richter," said Gatto.

40:51.061 --> 40:56.021
Mr Rolfe said his client's first wish,
after 15 months in custody,

40:56.056 --> 41:00.981
was to have a nice meal, probably
in Carlton, but not at La Porcella.

41:01.016 --> 41:04.261
No-one's been charged with
Graham Kinniburgh's murder.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.092
We're still working on that one.
