00:11.068 --> 00:12.517
- Previously
on "The Oval"...

00:12.517 --> 00:14.344
- Now you let
the Vice President just wander

00:14.344 --> 00:16.137
around the house.
He's a threat, Donald.

00:16.137 --> 00:18.068
- Sometimes it's better
to keep an eye on him.

00:18.068 --> 00:19.448
His days are numbered.

00:19.448 --> 00:22.206
- I keep telling you
there is no plan.

00:22.206 --> 00:24.344
- I'm not -- with you!

00:24.344 --> 00:26.586
- Hey, just come back inside.
- I killed my grandmother, Grip.

00:26.586 --> 00:27.896
- Jason.
- I did!

00:29.482 --> 00:31.620
- Do you think someone
is connected in the White House?

00:31.620 --> 00:33.413
- And as a result,
my office is invoking

00:33.413 --> 00:35.586
the 25th Amendment to remove
the President immediately.

00:35.586 --> 00:37.068
You dropped something.

00:46.758 --> 00:50.068
What the...

00:50.068 --> 00:53.172
- Got a pup down.
Pup down, East Lawn!

00:53.172 --> 00:56.241
- Help!
Help!

01:03.896 --> 01:05.517
- What the hell happened?
- He jumped!

01:05.517 --> 01:07.344
- How the hell did you
let that happen?

01:07.344 --> 01:09.620
- I tried stopping him.
- Shut up! Just shut up. Jason?

01:09.620 --> 01:11.517
- Jason, can you hear me?
- Go get the medic!

01:11.517 --> 01:14.172
- And the White House doctor.
- They're on their way.

01:14.172 --> 01:17.551
- Jason? Jason? Stay calm.
- He jumped so quick.

01:17.551 --> 01:19.241
- The hell was he doing
up there?

01:19.241 --> 01:20.931
- He said he went
up there to smoke.

01:20.931 --> 01:22.517
And you let him?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.896
- I didn't have orders from
the Chief of Staff to stop him.

01:24.896 --> 01:27.206
- Jason, stay with me, man.
Dammit.

01:27.206 --> 01:29.793
Where the hell is the doctor?

01:29.793 --> 01:32.068
- Who's that?
- It's Kyle.

01:32.068 --> 01:33.551
Damn.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.758
- Get me the hell
outta here!

01:35.758 --> 01:38.068
- Go. Go, go, go get the medic!
Go get the medic!

01:38.068 --> 01:39.724
- They're on their way!
- Go get 'em!

01:39.724 --> 01:42.551
- Don't go! He is not gonna
let me outta here. Don't go.

01:42.551 --> 01:44.172
- Kyle, shut the hell up!
- You mother--!

01:44.172 --> 01:46.310
- Shut the hell up!
The First Son is down.

01:46.310 --> 01:48.724
- I don't give a damn.
Get me the hell outta here now.

01:48.724 --> 01:50.275
Kyle!

01:50.275 --> 01:52.965
- What the hell are you
up to, Sam?

01:52.965 --> 01:56.206
Get him the hell outta here.

01:56.206 --> 01:58.965
Jason, Jason.
Hang on, man.

01:58.965 --> 02:00.758
It's okay, the doctors
are coming.

02:00.758 --> 02:02.344
The doctors are coming.

02:38.103 --> 02:39.551
- Why in the hell
are you cuffed?

02:39.551 --> 02:41.413
- Just unlock them.
- Okay.

02:41.413 --> 02:43.758
- What the hell hit the car?
- It's Jason.

02:43.758 --> 02:45.620
- What?
- Yeah.

02:45.620 --> 02:48.172
- The son?
- He jumped from the roof.

02:48.172 --> 02:51.379
What the hell?

02:51.379 --> 02:53.517
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

02:53.517 --> 02:55.310
- Dammit, just get
these cuffs off me now.

02:55.310 --> 02:56.793
Don't.

02:56.793 --> 02:59.689
- What the hell, Sam?
- I am your superior.

02:59.689 --> 03:01.620
And I'm ordering you
not to do it.

03:01.620 --> 03:03.241
- What the hell
you talking about?

03:03.241 --> 03:04.758
Take him to the cell.

03:04.758 --> 03:06.689
- What? What are you--
What are you even saying, huh?

03:06.689 --> 03:08.689
- Get his ass outta here.
Take him to the bunker

03:08.689 --> 03:10.620
- and wait for me.
- I am a federal officer!

03:10.620 --> 03:12.379
- And you are being held.
- On whose orders?

03:12.379 --> 03:16.448
- The orders of
the Vice President.

03:16.448 --> 03:18.310
- What the hell are you all
up to, huh?

03:18.310 --> 03:21.689
- Take him.
- It won't work.

03:21.689 --> 03:24.586
- It won't work!
- Get him outta here!

03:29.655 --> 03:32.620
I've gotta go inform
the First Family.

03:38.896 --> 03:41.517
- You get him off this
- - stage or I will.

03:41.517 --> 03:44.965
- No, sir. Sir, we shouldn't.
Not with the press right here.

03:44.965 --> 03:48.068
- Do I need to?
- Yes? Your questions?

03:48.068 --> 03:50.655
- I just wanna be clear
that I understand this.

03:50.655 --> 03:53.862
You're saying that the President
is responsible for the death

03:53.862 --> 03:55.448
of a prostitute.

03:55.448 --> 03:57.034
- That is exactly
what I'm saying.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.862
- Max?
- That's a lot going on.

04:04.862 --> 04:07.896
- I know.
- We better get him out of here.

04:07.896 --> 04:09.655
- Yeah.
- I got him.

04:09.655 --> 04:11.793
- Okay.
Sir, we need to move.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.551
- Thank you, folks.
That's all the questions

04:13.551 --> 04:15.896
- we have time for today.
- Ma'am, let's move.

04:26.137 --> 04:29.137
This way, sir.

04:29.137 --> 04:32.793
- Well...
Hi, guys.

04:32.793 --> 04:36.655
How about we all head back
to the Oval?

04:36.655 --> 04:38.586
- Sir.
- Sir, we need to move.

04:38.586 --> 04:40.448
- If you think you're
leaving these grounds,

04:40.448 --> 04:43.241
you are sadly mistaken.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.310
Sir?

04:45.310 --> 04:47.896
- Come.
- Let's go.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.965
- He's not going
into that room without me.

04:49.965 --> 04:55.241
- Look at you, Max.
Always a boy scout.

04:55.241 --> 04:57.655
And proud of it, sir.

04:57.655 --> 05:01.379
- Just so you know, Max,
it didn't mean anything.

05:01.379 --> 05:03.275
Just my life, sir.

05:03.275 --> 05:04.827
Exactly.

05:07.758 --> 05:11.482
Shall we go?

05:11.482 --> 05:14.724
Sir, I don't think we should.

05:14.724 --> 05:16.655
- What are they
gonna do, Donald?

05:16.655 --> 05:20.862
Shoot the President
in the Oval Office?

05:20.862 --> 05:23.241
I think that's even
beneath this lot.

05:23.241 --> 05:24.965
Sir...

05:24.965 --> 05:29.241
- Shall we go?
- All of you, in the Oval.

05:30.896 --> 05:32.758
Sir!

05:32.758 --> 05:34.482
Sir, sir.

05:34.482 --> 05:37.655
- Not now, Sam.
- But sir...

05:37.655 --> 05:41.379
- Donald, will you
get him under control, please?

05:41.379 --> 05:44.034
To the Oval, now.

05:46.655 --> 05:48.310
Move.

05:53.965 --> 05:56.413
- Ma'am...
- I am not in the mood for this.

05:56.413 --> 05:58.862
But ma'am, it's your son.

05:58.862 --> 06:00.724
- I have a pressing matter
to deal with.

06:00.724 --> 06:02.931
- Ma'am, he jumped
from the roof.

06:06.034 --> 06:07.551
And?

06:11.068 --> 06:13.068
What's your point?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.724
Ma'am...

06:18.206 --> 06:20.758
- Sam?
Sam, did I hear you right?

06:20.758 --> 06:23.931
- Yes, sir.
- Is he okay?

06:23.931 --> 06:26.206
- He landed on a vehicle.
- Damn.

06:26.206 --> 06:27.620
I tried to tell him.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.517
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Where is he?

06:30.517 --> 06:32.413
- He's being rushed
to St. Rose Hospital, sir.

06:32.413 --> 06:33.793
- Okay, you keep me posted.
Okay?

06:33.793 --> 06:36.655
- Yes, sir.
- Where is Kyle?

06:36.655 --> 06:39.758
- I don't know.
I'm sorry, sir.

06:39.758 --> 06:42.241
- Okay, you contact him
and you tell him

06:42.241 --> 06:44.689
to get his ass here right now.
You understand? Right now.

06:44.689 --> 06:46.137
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

06:52.448 --> 06:54.034
- Sir...
- Not now, Donald.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.827
- Sir, this is important.
- And this isn't?

06:56.827 --> 07:01.862
- Sir, you...
- Just shut the -- up.

07:01.862 --> 07:03.689
Hi, Max.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.413
- Ma'am.
- I'm glad you're okay.

07:06.413 --> 07:08.862
- I'm sure you are.
- For now.

07:12.448 --> 07:15.517
- Look, I'm going to the party
this evening, and we're going

07:15.517 --> 07:18.482
to talk about you resigning
and walking away.

07:18.482 --> 07:22.448
- You're going
to my party?

07:22.448 --> 07:25.965
- Yes.
It's my party as well.

07:25.965 --> 07:30.758
- You're a joke.
Nobody cares about you.

07:30.758 --> 07:34.517
- Regardless of what you think
of me, I am invoking

07:34.517 --> 07:39.241
- the 25th Amendment.
- You slimy little --.

07:39.241 --> 07:42.862
He and his wife.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.655
- You really think this
is going to work?

07:44.655 --> 07:46.413
We know it's going to work.

07:46.413 --> 07:48.000
We have all the proof
that we need.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.793
- And what proof is that?
The word of these two?

07:53.793 --> 07:56.068
- We have a bloody mattress top
that was found here

07:56.068 --> 07:57.793
in the White House.

07:57.793 --> 07:59.482
Really?

07:59.482 --> 08:03.413
- Eye witnesses.
- Eye witnesses?

08:03.413 --> 08:07.310
- Yes.
- Including your wife.

08:07.310 --> 08:12.034
- My wife?
- Yes. She's fine.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.034
I see.

08:14.034 --> 08:16.551
- Your thing with Kyle
didn't work out so well.

08:16.551 --> 08:19.827
Hm, I see.

08:19.827 --> 08:22.517
- Okay, are we done here?
Is that all?

08:22.517 --> 08:25.862
- Yes.
My wife and I are leaving.

08:25.862 --> 08:27.827
And soon you will be, too.

08:27.827 --> 08:31.896
- You think so, huh?
- Oh, I know so. It's done.

08:31.896 --> 08:34.655
Don't count on it, skippy.

08:34.655 --> 08:36.689
And you...

08:36.689 --> 08:40.655
- Yes.
- You lying little bitch.

08:40.655 --> 08:42.862
I knew you weren't
telling me the truth.

08:42.862 --> 08:46.275
- Now, why would I
tell you the truth,

08:46.275 --> 08:49.689
when you're completely
incapable of doing the same?

08:49.689 --> 08:51.758
- Hmm?
- You know...

08:51.758 --> 08:53.862
- Shut up!
- Ooh.

08:53.862 --> 08:58.413
- You are a rude, venomous,
pestilential, disgusting bitch.

09:00.034 --> 09:03.724
- And I look forward
to returning dignity

09:03.724 --> 09:07.862
to this White House.
You're a disgrace.

09:07.862 --> 09:13.103
- Look, Hunter.
She don't know.

09:13.103 --> 09:18.965
- I'll slap a bitch.
- Of course you will.

09:18.965 --> 09:21.551
And he'll decapitate one.

09:21.551 --> 09:23.137
Careful.

09:23.137 --> 09:27.137
- There's nothing
to be careful for.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.827
You two are over.

09:29.827 --> 09:31.724
Come on, honey.

09:31.724 --> 09:33.965
- And I look forward
to you two leaving this

09:33.965 --> 09:37.275
White House with your tail
tucked between your legs.

09:37.275 --> 09:39.310
Honey, come on.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.241
Yes, dear.

09:41.241 --> 09:45.413
You really don't wanna
insult mother.

09:45.413 --> 09:47.862
Honey?

09:47.862 --> 09:50.379
- Sir, how was your
talk with Sam?

09:50.379 --> 09:51.896
Excuse me?

09:51.896 --> 09:54.413
- He came to see you
about working with you, right?

09:54.413 --> 09:55.931
That's a lie.

09:55.931 --> 09:57.896
- Then what exactly did he
come to talk to you about?

09:57.896 --> 10:00.413
He knows our children.

10:00.413 --> 10:02.172
Ah.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.172
- What was that about?
- That was a disaster.

10:27.172 --> 10:28.931
- I was just doing
some fact checking.

10:28.931 --> 10:31.137
Fact checking what?

10:31.137 --> 10:32.793
It's fine.

10:32.793 --> 10:34.758
- It's not fine.
They just told the whole world

10:34.758 --> 10:37.275
a big pile of lies.

10:37.275 --> 10:41.000
- It's fine.
- Are you insane?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
How can you say
it's fine, Victoria?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.896
- Look at my face.
Do I look worried?

10:45.896 --> 10:48.137
- I can never tell
what's on your face.

10:48.137 --> 10:49.620
That's right.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.448
'Cause you think
this is pleasure.

10:51.448 --> 10:53.862
- Why don't you give it
a -- rest?

10:53.862 --> 10:56.931
- As I said,
everything's okay.

10:56.931 --> 10:58.689
How?

10:58.689 --> 11:02.275
Your son jumped off the roof.

11:02.275 --> 11:03.862
What?

11:03.862 --> 11:08.000
- Yes.
He jumped off the roof.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.758
- Are you kidding
around? What are you saying?

11:09.758 --> 11:13.379
No, I'm telling you.

11:13.379 --> 11:15.931
- Tell him, Donald.
- Is it...

11:15.931 --> 11:18.206
- Sir, I tried to tell you.
- Is he alive?

11:18.206 --> 11:19.862
- He's at the hospital
right now, sir.

11:19.862 --> 11:21.724
Is he okay?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.517
I don't know.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.482
- The hell do you mean?
What do you mean you don't know?

11:26.482 --> 11:27.862
How long have you known this?

11:27.862 --> 11:29.965
- Sir, we just found out.
I tried to tell you

11:29.965 --> 11:31.793
before the meeting.
You didn't wanna hear it.

11:34.206 --> 11:36.586
- You knew this
before the whole damn meeting?

11:36.586 --> 11:38.448
- Yes.
- And you didn't say anything,

11:38.448 --> 11:40.206
- Victoria?
- Why would I?

11:40.206 --> 11:45.206
- Priorities, darling.
- That is our son!

11:45.206 --> 11:48.586
Do you care about anything,
about him at all?

11:48.586 --> 11:52.241
Of course I care.

11:52.241 --> 11:53.827
In public.

11:53.827 --> 11:56.000
- Okay, I can't...
I need to get to the hospital.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.172
- Sir, I'll get the motorcade.
- No, Marine 1.

11:58.172 --> 11:59.620
- Yes, sir.
- Look at you acting

11:59.620 --> 12:02.586
- all concerned.
- I am.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.517
Well, so am I.

12:04.517 --> 12:06.310
Go to hell, Victoria.

12:14.448 --> 12:16.758
- Donald?
- Ma'am?

12:16.758 --> 12:18.551
Assemble the press corps.

12:18.551 --> 12:20.482
- Ma'am, shouldn't you
be going to the hospital?

12:20.482 --> 12:23.896
Assemble them.

12:23.896 --> 12:26.448
- No. No, ma'am.
I don't think that's wise.

12:26.448 --> 12:28.862
- Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

12:28.862 --> 12:32.034
- Ma'am?
- You know what? Never mind.

12:32.034 --> 12:34.655
I'll have my people do it.

12:34.655 --> 12:38.275
- Ma'am, what exactly
are you gonna do?

12:38.275 --> 12:40.034
- Ma'am?
- What?

12:40.034 --> 12:42.137
Your son is not dead.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.862
- Well, he jumped
off this building.

12:45.862 --> 12:48.034
- He may as well be.
- First Lady...

12:48.034 --> 12:51.275
- Whew, you bitches
with these weak-ass stomachs.

12:51.275 --> 12:53.034
Just do what I say.

13:00.689 --> 13:02.827
Here.

13:02.827 --> 13:04.241
What's this?

13:04.241 --> 13:05.862
- There was a problem
with your car.

13:05.862 --> 13:08.000
- What happened?
- An accident.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.448
- Where's Kyle?
- He's secure.

13:10.448 --> 13:11.862
- Where?
- Here.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.344
- We gotta get him
to his motorcade.

13:13.344 --> 13:15.793
- Okay. I had 'em add another
vehicle for you.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.068
- No, we're riding with him.
- Okay.

13:18.068 --> 13:19.655
I'll be in touch.

13:19.655 --> 13:20.931
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what about Kyle?

13:20.931 --> 13:22.896
- He's secure.
- No, not 'til I have him.

13:22.896 --> 13:25.310
- Max, I got this.
- Sam! I wanna know where he is!

13:25.310 --> 13:30.206
- We need to leave now.
- Yes, do that.

13:30.206 --> 13:33.413
- Come on.
Let's get him to the motorcade.

13:36.724 --> 13:39.275
This is bullshit, Sam.

13:44.482 --> 13:46.379
You okay?

13:46.379 --> 13:47.827
Yeah.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.034
- I thought something was wrong
since you wanted to see me.

13:50.034 --> 13:54.379
- Oh, no, no.
I just wanted to talk to you.

13:54.379 --> 13:55.896
Have a seat.

13:58.241 --> 14:01.724
Oh, girl.

14:01.724 --> 14:04.034
- You want some tea?
- Nancy.

14:04.034 --> 14:07.241
- What?
- What is this about?

14:07.241 --> 14:10.000
- What do you mean?
- I mean this. What is it about?

14:12.103 --> 14:15.689
- Okay.
You know.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.655
- Richard asked you
to talk to me.

14:17.655 --> 14:20.655
- Yes, he did.
- I'm fine.

14:20.655 --> 14:22.068
Are you?

14:22.068 --> 14:24.000
- Yes, you don't have
to worry about me.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.724
Are you sure?

14:25.724 --> 14:27.344
What did he say to you?

14:27.344 --> 14:29.793
- He said that you are
not yourself there

14:29.793 --> 14:33.172
- at the White House.
- Well, I'm not.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.896
- Why don't you take
some time off?

14:34.896 --> 14:37.034
- I'm not doing it.
- Why?

14:37.034 --> 14:40.379
- Nancy, she is
a horrible human.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.827
Is she?

14:41.827 --> 14:43.758
- Oh, you won't believe
how bad she is.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.620
And how bad she
treats her children.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.275
And now I gotta deal
with this thing about Sam.

14:48.275 --> 14:50.586
And then she just went
after him. And he went for it.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.068
Priscilla...

14:52.068 --> 14:55.413
- I don't even know how I'm
supposed to process that.

14:55.413 --> 14:59.620
- Mm-hmm. And you still have
to cook for this woman?

14:59.620 --> 15:01.241
No, not anymore.

15:01.241 --> 15:03.620
'Cause I don't trust myself
with her and she don't

15:03.620 --> 15:05.551
trust herself with me.

15:05.551 --> 15:07.172
Did you confront her?

15:07.172 --> 15:09.448
- Called her everything
I could think of.

15:09.448 --> 15:12.344
- And you still
have a job?

15:12.344 --> 15:16.137
- Oh, she don't have the kind
of power she thinks she has.

15:16.137 --> 15:18.827
- What?
- I mean exactly what I said.

15:18.827 --> 15:20.482
She don't have
that kind of power.

15:20.482 --> 15:24.655
Then today, she wanted me to sit
at the table and eat with her.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.206
What?

15:26.206 --> 15:28.689
- Mm-hmm. This little game
she likes to play.

15:28.689 --> 15:31.000
Oh, but she got the right one.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.655
- Ooh, Priscilla.
Priscilla, this is dangerous.

15:34.655 --> 15:36.275
What you want me to do?

15:36.275 --> 15:39.310
- I want you to take
some time off.

15:39.310 --> 15:41.034
- I'm not giving her
the satisfaction.

15:41.034 --> 15:42.448
Why not?

15:42.448 --> 15:44.379
- What am I gonna do
with time off, huh?

15:44.379 --> 15:47.965
Just sit around and do nothing?
I'm not you, Nancy!

15:50.965 --> 15:55.310
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.965
- No, you meant it.
- No, I'm sorry.

15:58.965 --> 16:01.172
I don't just sit around.

16:01.172 --> 16:03.793
I take care of my husband
and my son.

16:03.793 --> 16:06.827
- I know. I know.
I didn't mean it.

16:06.827 --> 16:09.827
I understand.

16:09.827 --> 16:13.275
All I wanted to do was just make
sure you that you were okay.

16:13.275 --> 16:16.931
- I know. I know.
And I insulted you.

16:16.931 --> 16:19.137
No, I'm not insulted.

16:19.137 --> 16:21.310
- Look, let me just go home
and get some rest

16:21.310 --> 16:23.896
'cause this has all
been very trying.

16:23.896 --> 16:26.000
- I understand.
I understand.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.586
But I'm really sorry.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.482
Okay.

16:29.482 --> 16:32.310
- Well, thank you for checking
on me. I really appreciate it.

16:32.310 --> 16:34.068
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean it.

16:34.068 --> 16:36.413
- Thank you for coming by.
- Okay.

16:45.965 --> 16:48.034
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:48.034 --> 16:50.413
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

16:50.413 --> 16:51.724
In here.

17:02.620 --> 17:08.137
- That kid.
- Yeah. I know.

17:08.137 --> 17:13.172
- Is he all right?
- He's in critical condition.

17:13.172 --> 17:14.758
So what happened?

17:14.758 --> 17:17.793
- Damn Grip was supposed
to be watching him.

17:17.793 --> 17:19.965
Damn.

17:19.965 --> 17:24.689
- But you know he's trouble.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

17:24.689 --> 17:29.482
- He confessed to Jean's death.
- Yeah.

17:29.482 --> 17:34.137
- Mr. Vice President was on
to something, but not totally.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.482
What?

17:36.482 --> 17:40.137
- Well, you can't blame him
for both deaths.

17:40.137 --> 17:43.517
Yeah, I know that.

17:43.517 --> 17:45.931
- He better
get his facts straight.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.655
Will you come talk to him?

17:48.655 --> 17:50.965
Sam, I can't.

17:50.965 --> 17:53.793
- Richard, we are
lining up witnesses.

17:53.793 --> 17:57.344
Sam, you know I can't do that.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.965
What I know working here
all these years?

18:00.965 --> 18:03.965
Look, I'm telling you, you're
gonna have to tell him. I can't.

18:03.965 --> 18:05.448
Okay.

18:08.344 --> 18:12.275
- Did you talk
to him about Sharon?

18:12.275 --> 18:14.931
- Yeah.
I talked to the Chief of Staff.

18:14.931 --> 18:17.827
- Sam, why'd
you do that?

18:17.827 --> 18:21.620
- He boxed me in. I had to.
- Oh, Sam, he is in on it.

18:21.620 --> 18:25.034
I felt that.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.827
You be careful.

18:26.827 --> 18:28.586
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

18:31.655 --> 18:33.241
I'm gonna go home.

18:33.241 --> 18:36.241
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah. You need to.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.724
I got you.

18:38.724 --> 18:41.517
- All right, well,
keep me posted.

18:41.517 --> 18:45.344
I'm gonna stop by and
tell Sharon just to be careful.

18:45.344 --> 18:49.206
- Okay. Sounds good.
Take care, okay?

18:49.206 --> 18:50.896
- Yeah.
You do the same.

19:05.793 --> 19:07.793
- Who is it?
- It's Alonzo.

19:13.827 --> 19:15.206
- Shut that.
- Yeah.

19:15.206 --> 19:17.896
I thought you were gone.

19:17.896 --> 19:19.413
I was.

19:24.034 --> 19:28.965
- Okay. What's up?
- Did you hear?

19:28.965 --> 19:31.344
- Hear what?
- The First Son.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.793
- Dude, what about him?
- He jumped off the roof.

19:34.793 --> 19:38.137
Really?

19:38.137 --> 19:39.689
You don't seem surprised.

19:39.689 --> 19:42.448
- Uh, are you?
I mean, we both know

19:42.448 --> 19:44.551
that kid is
bat shit crazy, right?

19:44.551 --> 19:47.793
- Yeah.
I know that.

19:47.793 --> 19:50.724
- So?
- Damn.

19:50.724 --> 19:55.827
- Look, what are you
doing back here, man?

19:55.827 --> 20:00.931
- I know this is hard for you.
I know how much you loved her.

20:00.931 --> 20:02.862
Yeah.

20:02.862 --> 20:06.344
I loved her much more
than she loved me, Alonzo.

20:06.344 --> 20:08.379
No, that's not true.

20:08.379 --> 20:10.448
Oh, no, no, no. It is.

20:10.448 --> 20:13.344
Uh, she was --
the damn President.

20:13.344 --> 20:14.758
You don't believe that.

20:14.758 --> 20:18.172
- Yeah, I know it was true, man.
I believe it.

20:18.172 --> 20:20.931
- That was the
Press Secretary being jealous.

20:20.931 --> 20:23.689
- Here we go.
Oh, man.

20:23.689 --> 20:29.655
I know it was true.
Okay? She told me.

20:29.655 --> 20:32.551
That's why I know
that the First Lady

20:32.551 --> 20:34.724
had something to do
with Ellie's death.

20:34.724 --> 20:36.172
Don't start that.

20:36.172 --> 20:40.172
- Oh, come on, man.
Can you just hear me out?

20:40.172 --> 20:41.931
- I can't listen.
- Why?

20:41.931 --> 20:43.344
Because...

20:43.344 --> 20:45.724
- Because why?
Alonzo, what do you know, man?

20:45.724 --> 20:50.586
- The Vice President.
He went off talking about

20:50.586 --> 20:53.275
the President and
the First Lady

20:53.275 --> 20:55.827
being responsible
for two deaths.

20:55.827 --> 20:58.655
Jean included.

20:58.655 --> 21:04.034
But I know that kid killed Jean.
I heard him say it.

21:04.034 --> 21:06.310
I saw her walk up
to his room

21:06.310 --> 21:08.448
and never come out on footage.

21:08.448 --> 21:10.931
- So, so, what
are you saying, man?

21:10.931 --> 21:14.448
- They're blaming the President
and the First Lady.

21:14.448 --> 21:18.068
They didn't do it.
That kid did it.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.896
- So, are, are you telling me
that you think the kid

21:20.896 --> 21:23.931
had something to do
with killing Ellie?

21:23.931 --> 21:26.000
- Could be.
- All right.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.862
Look, maybe I would've believed
that, okay? But she called me.

21:30.862 --> 21:33.724
The First Lady called me.
Rang my phone.

21:33.724 --> 21:35.172
- Wait...
- The First Lady.

21:35.172 --> 21:36.724
She said she did it?

21:36.724 --> 21:39.310
- No. She didn't say all that.
But...

21:39.310 --> 21:41.827
Look...

21:41.827 --> 21:43.758
- I think it was that kid.
- No, no, no.

21:43.758 --> 21:46.551
- I really do.
- Okay, look. I can't do this.

21:46.551 --> 21:49.482
I can't do this anymore, okay?
Please.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.965
- Well, let's not.
Let's drink.

21:52.965 --> 21:56.068
Shit.

21:56.068 --> 22:00.275
- I can't believe this, man.
This is all so crazy.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.758
Come on, man.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.275
I can't believe it.

22:08.275 --> 22:11.068
I can't believe she's...
She's gone.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.517
- I'm sorry.
Let me pour.

22:26.103 --> 22:29.000
- All right. Y'all wanna wait
outside while I lock up?

22:29.000 --> 22:34.310
- No, we're good.
- Yeah, we're, we're with you.

22:34.310 --> 22:37.620
- What's happening here?
- What do you mean?

22:37.620 --> 22:41.448
- I mean, you two have been
under me since I got here.

22:41.448 --> 22:44.586
- Well...
- Are you worried?

22:44.586 --> 22:46.620
No. No.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.000
Sharon?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.413
- We just know there's
power in numbers, so...

22:51.413 --> 22:53.379
- If there is something wrong,
guys, don't you think

22:53.379 --> 22:55.551
- you should tell me?
- Kareem, it's fine.

22:55.551 --> 22:57.206
- Tell him.
- No.

22:57.206 --> 22:58.896
Tell him.

22:58.896 --> 23:01.655
- One of you tell me something.
Both of you actin' like kids.

23:01.655 --> 23:03.379
- Tell him.
- Dale, stop.

23:03.379 --> 23:05.724
- Somebody tell me.
- Kareem, it's...

23:05.724 --> 23:08.068
- What the hell?

23:08.068 --> 23:12.931
- Oh,
it's just Mr. Richard.

23:12.931 --> 23:14.551
We're closed.

23:20.068 --> 23:21.965
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.517
Hey.

23:26.344 --> 23:28.896
- Hey, uh...
- What's up?

23:28.896 --> 23:32.275
- Listen, can we, uh,
can we talk outside?

23:32.275 --> 23:33.793
Yeah. Yeah.

23:42.310 --> 23:45.862
Listen, how are you?

23:45.862 --> 23:47.793
I'm okay.

23:47.793 --> 23:49.137
Okay, good.

23:49.137 --> 23:52.413
I, uh, spoke with Sam.

23:52.413 --> 23:54.655
What did he say?

23:54.655 --> 23:57.379
They're looking into it.

23:57.379 --> 23:58.862
What does that mean?

23:58.862 --> 24:02.517
- That means that this
is very complicated.

24:02.517 --> 24:04.241
Okay, I can imagine.

24:04.241 --> 24:06.068
Yeah.

24:06.068 --> 24:08.551
Uh, nobody's bothered you?

24:08.551 --> 24:10.655
No, no one.

24:10.655 --> 24:13.379
Okay. That's good.

24:13.379 --> 24:15.344
- Okay.
Um, I feel like...

24:15.344 --> 24:16.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:16.758 --> 24:18.655
Barry, yeah, what
are you doing here?

24:18.655 --> 24:20.655
I figured it out.

24:20.655 --> 24:22.724
What are you talking about?

24:22.724 --> 24:25.827
- You and the President.
- What?

24:25.827 --> 24:27.620
- Look, I was
in that store with Denise.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.793
And that agent came
and took her to the White House.

24:30.793 --> 24:33.965
And then I never saw her again.

24:33.965 --> 24:36.724
- Did he send someone after you?
- Barry...

24:36.724 --> 24:38.172
- Now, Barry...
- No, Dad.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.034
That man is crazy.
And I know he did something

24:41.034 --> 24:43.379
to Denise, and now he's
getting away with it.

24:43.379 --> 24:47.137
We are handling it.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.137
He is?

24:49.137 --> 24:51.724
- Barry, look, you are not
supposed to know this shit.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.862
- Why the hell not, Dad?
Because it's the President?

24:53.862 --> 24:55.655
- No, because there's a lot
of moving parts

24:55.655 --> 24:59.275
and it's very dangerous.

24:59.275 --> 25:02.172
- Sharon, what'd he do to you?
- Barry, will you just go home?

25:02.172 --> 25:05.551
- Tell me.
- Nothing.

25:05.551 --> 25:08.068
Did he send someone after you?

25:08.068 --> 25:10.000
- Barry...
- Did he?

25:10.000 --> 25:15.620
- Barry, if you just go home,
I will tell you everything.

25:15.620 --> 25:17.448
- Sharon, I need you
to come home with me.

25:17.448 --> 25:18.965
- What?
- This asshole

25:18.965 --> 25:23.103
cannot protect you.
I can. Come home with me.

25:23.103 --> 25:25.586
- I'm not coming back with you.
- Well, I need you to.

25:25.586 --> 25:27.655
- Barry, will you just go home?
Please, go home!

25:27.655 --> 25:29.241
- Sharon, you know how much
I love you.

25:29.241 --> 25:33.103
- I need you to come home with me.
- Barry...

25:33.103 --> 25:35.517
- All right, come on.
Everything all right?

25:35.517 --> 25:37.137
- Yes, --!
- Everything...

25:37.137 --> 25:39.793
- Go back in the store!
- Everything is fine.

25:39.793 --> 25:41.482
- Barry was just leaving.
- I wasn't leaving.

25:41.482 --> 25:42.965
- And so was
Mr. Richard.

25:42.965 --> 25:45.000
- Yes.
Look,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.931
- you just remember what I said.
- Yes. Okay.

25:48.931 --> 25:50.655
Come on, Barry.

25:50.655 --> 25:52.137
- Sharon--
- Come on!

25:57.379 --> 25:59.551
You okay?

25:59.551 --> 26:01.413
Yeah.

26:01.413 --> 26:03.793
Well?

26:03.793 --> 26:05.551
- Look, can we just lock up
and go back

26:05.551 --> 26:08.379
to your place, please?

26:08.379 --> 26:11.137
- Yeah.
Yeah, come on.

26:17.620 --> 26:19.137
My son.

26:22.310 --> 26:23.931
My husband.

26:28.344 --> 26:30.241
This shit ain't gonna work.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.655
Ma'am?

26:43.655 --> 26:47.448
- I thought you were
at the hospital.

26:47.448 --> 26:50.551
No, ma'am. I'm not.

26:50.551 --> 26:52.689
Okay.

27:00.172 --> 27:04.931
- Ma'am, do you wanna know
how your son is doing?

27:04.931 --> 27:09.137
- Look at me.
- Yes?

27:09.137 --> 27:11.000
Do I look sad?

27:14.413 --> 27:16.413
- No, ma'am.
You look angry.

27:16.413 --> 27:18.103
Shit.

27:20.379 --> 27:23.310
- I'm trying to make myself sad.
- Well, perhaps if

27:23.310 --> 27:25.448
I tell you how
your son's doing that might...

27:25.448 --> 27:29.068
- No.
No.

27:29.068 --> 27:33.413
The thought of him being in pain
actually brings me joy.

27:33.413 --> 27:35.206
Wow.

27:35.206 --> 27:37.517
- And him jumping
from the building?

27:37.517 --> 27:42.448
That's just...

27:42.448 --> 27:45.586
That shit is just funny.

27:45.586 --> 27:49.379
It's just..
What, did he have a Red Bull?

27:53.068 --> 27:54.310
Huh.

27:54.310 --> 27:59.655
- He thought he had wings.
He thought he had wings.

28:04.758 --> 28:06.965
I know that's my son.

28:09.724 --> 28:14.586
But that little mother--
is crazy.

28:14.586 --> 28:15.965
I see, ma'am.

28:18.758 --> 28:23.000
Let me pull myself together.
Ooh.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.517
- I got tears.
- Yeah.

28:26.517 --> 28:30.137
- That's what I was
trying to get.

28:30.137 --> 28:35.517
But it's the wrong reaction.
Whew.

28:35.517 --> 28:37.827
Emotions are weird, huh?

28:42.482 --> 28:44.862
I'm sorry.

28:44.862 --> 28:47.000
I'm better now.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.344
- I'll wait 'til
you're done, ma'am.

28:50.344 --> 28:53.206
I'm done.

28:53.206 --> 28:56.965
Donald, I wanna
tell you a story.

28:56.965 --> 28:59.310
I'm gonna try not to laugh.

28:59.310 --> 29:02.344
- When he was a little boy...
- Uh-huh.

29:02.344 --> 29:04.827
- I told him about
"The Wizard of Oz".

29:04.827 --> 29:08.034
You know, the Scarecrow
needing a brain,

29:08.034 --> 29:12.000
Lion needing courage,
Tin Man needing a heart.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.206
- I think I see where this
is going, ma'am.

29:14.206 --> 29:16.206
- But you know what
I need right now?

29:16.206 --> 29:18.620
What's that?

29:18.620 --> 29:21.206
- I need to see the Wizard
to be able to cry for this

29:21.206 --> 29:26.965
mother--!

29:26.965 --> 29:32.206
You know it's funny!
This shit is funny!

29:32.206 --> 29:34.275
Oh, God.

29:34.275 --> 29:37.310
That's why I'm
wearing this dress.

29:37.310 --> 29:40.551
The yellow brick road.

29:40.551 --> 29:43.068
I was just trying
to remind myself.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.517
Okay.
I'm being all serious.

29:53.517 --> 29:55.965
What is it?

29:55.965 --> 29:57.724
You need help, ma'am.

30:00.827 --> 30:04.379
I know!
I need to see the Wizard!

30:08.379 --> 30:13.551
- You know, maybe we could bring
your son's doctor in and help?

30:13.551 --> 30:15.379
Maybe you can talk to her?

30:15.379 --> 30:18.137
- Okay, okay,
okay, okay, Donald.

30:18.137 --> 30:19.586
What is it?

30:19.586 --> 30:24.206
- Well, ma'am, I'm almost afraid
to tell you this, but...

30:24.206 --> 30:27.551
- The press is assembled.
- Good.

30:27.551 --> 30:29.793
- I'm a little afraid
of what you're gonna say.

30:29.793 --> 30:32.034
You wanna prep me on that?

30:32.034 --> 30:35.793
- Well, if I wanted
to do that, I would have

30:35.793 --> 30:38.344
done it already.

30:38.344 --> 30:41.724
I'm gonna tell 'em to follow
the yellow brick road, honey.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.103
- Well, ma'am, maybe I can
help you with what you're

30:47.103 --> 30:49.724
- about to do at least. You know?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:49.724 --> 30:51.103
- Just guide you through
what to say?

30:51.103 --> 30:52.620
- No, no, no, no.
- No?

30:52.620 --> 30:55.448
- I got it.
I got it.

30:55.448 --> 30:57.965
- Look, ma'am, they are waiting,
but I don't know if we

30:57.965 --> 30:59.482
should do this.
Okay, maybe we could...

30:59.482 --> 31:03.931
- Oh, Donald,
you need to see the Wizard too.

31:03.931 --> 31:06.655
You're the Lion.

31:06.655 --> 31:10.413
Have courage.

31:10.413 --> 31:13.310
- Ah, ma'am, I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

31:13.310 --> 31:16.862
Do you wanna explain
to me this laughing?

31:16.862 --> 31:20.034
I don't understand.

31:20.034 --> 31:23.137
- I'm...I'm trying
to do something that's

31:23.137 --> 31:26.310
- very, very difficult for me.
- Okay.

31:26.310 --> 31:30.344
- And that's look concerned
or have...

31:30.344 --> 31:34.068
Oh, God, what's the...
What's the...

31:34.068 --> 31:35.689
- Empathy, ma'am.

31:35.689 --> 31:38.758
That shit, yeah.

31:38.758 --> 31:41.275
Well, good luck with that.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.103
Yeah.

31:43.103 --> 31:47.758
Well, um...
Let me just get a drink

31:47.758 --> 31:51.551
and I'll be in there, okay?

31:51.551 --> 31:53.379
Oh, goodness.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.172
Yes, ma'am.

31:56.172 --> 32:00.620
Thank you, Donald.

32:00.620 --> 32:02.551
Yeah.

32:02.551 --> 32:04.724
Ma'am, perhaps if I told you
how your son

32:04.724 --> 32:06.103
- was actually doing...
- No...

32:06.103 --> 32:07.586
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am...
- Donald...

32:07.586 --> 32:09.379
- Ma'am, look, ma'am, look.
Your son...

32:09.379 --> 32:12.448
- Don't make me.
Please don't make me smile.

32:12.448 --> 32:14.241
- Ma'am, look. Your son is
in critical condition.

32:14.241 --> 32:15.689
I'm serious...

32:15.689 --> 32:17.862
- He's not doing so well.
Maybe you could just...

32:17.862 --> 32:19.482
- I'm serious, Donald.
- Come on, ma'am.

32:19.482 --> 32:25.068
- All that shit is funny
to me, Donald. Just stop.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.137
I've been trying to get rid
of that little bastard

32:27.137 --> 32:30.206
- since he could talk.

32:30.206 --> 32:35.275
- So -- annoying.
Just go. Go.

32:35.275 --> 32:38.379
Just give me a minute.
I'll get it together.

32:41.655 --> 32:45.103
Yes, Mr. Lion.

32:45.103 --> 32:47.931
- I'll call the White House
doctor tomorrow, ma'am.

32:47.931 --> 32:51.448
- Get the hell
outta here, Donald.

32:51.448 --> 32:55.517
- Jesus.
- Okay, I have to do it.

32:59.034 --> 33:02.344
Cry, girl.
Cry.

33:22.758 --> 33:27.103
- Lilly, put the damn gun down.
- Hi.

33:30.068 --> 33:32.965
How are you?

33:32.965 --> 33:34.896
I'm feeling better.

33:34.896 --> 33:38.310
Good.

33:38.310 --> 33:43.413
- I was just, um,
watching the news.

33:43.413 --> 33:45.000
Okay.

33:53.310 --> 33:57.413
So, Vice President did it.

33:57.413 --> 34:00.689
Yeah, he did.

34:00.689 --> 34:03.000
So what do we do now?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.689
We don't know.

34:07.517 --> 34:10.551
We just sit here?

34:10.551 --> 34:14.137
- He's building a case.
Did you get that?

34:14.137 --> 34:16.896
- Okay, well...
What about me?

34:16.896 --> 34:18.448
What do I do?

34:18.448 --> 34:20.172
- This isn't even
about you, darling.

34:20.172 --> 34:21.655
- Max, enough.
- There are bigger things...

34:21.655 --> 34:23.793
- Enough! Enough.
Okay?

34:23.793 --> 34:28.034
- I didn't mean that.
Okay?

34:28.034 --> 34:29.620
It's okay.

34:38.344 --> 34:42.586
I meant, what happens next?

34:42.586 --> 34:44.310
We'll figure it out.

34:46.655 --> 34:49.448
You sure you're okay?

34:49.448 --> 34:52.379
- Yeah, I'm just, you know,
I'm just still

34:52.379 --> 34:56.137
spitting up water
but...I'm fine.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.896
That's good.

34:57.896 --> 35:02.896
- Yeah. I'm just so tired
of running and hiding, you know?

35:05.310 --> 35:07.551
It could be all over soon.

35:07.551 --> 35:10.413
- Yeah, well, he tried
to kill me.

35:10.413 --> 35:13.379
- I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

35:13.379 --> 35:16.551
- Yeah, well, I know
you weren't but...

35:16.551 --> 35:18.275
But?

35:22.241 --> 35:26.000
I realized something.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.482
What's that?

35:28.482 --> 35:33.103
- None of this is gonna
be over until he's dead.

35:33.103 --> 35:35.482
What?

35:35.482 --> 35:39.793
- Yeah, my life will not be okay
until he's dead.

35:44.241 --> 35:46.586
Well, that may be soon.

35:46.586 --> 35:50.241
Him and Kyle.

35:50.241 --> 35:53.068
We have Kyle.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.724
Where is he?

35:54.724 --> 35:56.827
- He's in a bunker
at the White House.

35:56.827 --> 35:59.724
- What?
- Yeah.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.172
Get him to me.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.310
- Look, I'm working on it.
I just have to see

36:04.310 --> 36:07.000
how this thing plays out
with the Vice President.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.965
Okay.

36:10.965 --> 36:12.517
It's gonna be okay.

36:15.827 --> 36:19.655
Okay.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.275
You want a drink?

36:24.172 --> 36:27.724
Yeah.

36:27.724 --> 36:29.793
I'll get it.

36:29.793 --> 36:31.413
All right.

36:45.068 --> 36:47.413
- This is Sam.
- It's me.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.965
Hey.

36:48.965 --> 36:51.310
- So where is he?
- He's here, Max.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.931
I want him.

36:52.931 --> 36:54.310
I can't let you have him.

36:54.310 --> 36:57.241
Sam, come on.

36:57.241 --> 37:01.275
- Yeah, I know
what he did to you.

37:01.275 --> 37:03.137
- He didn't just try
to kill me.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.965
- He threatened my kid.
- I know.

37:05.965 --> 37:08.482
- Can't you just bring him
somewhere and leave him?

37:08.482 --> 37:11.310
Max, you're asking me to...

37:11.310 --> 37:13.206
- I know what I'm asking
you to do.

37:13.206 --> 37:15.000
Well, then you know I can't.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.896
- Sam, eventually you're gonna
have to choose a side in this.

37:19.896 --> 37:21.344
I am on the side of right.

37:21.344 --> 37:24.068
- I know that,
and so was I.

37:24.068 --> 37:26.517
But as long as we play
by the rules,

37:26.517 --> 37:29.413
they'll keep winning.

37:29.413 --> 37:33.137
- And if we don't,
then we all lose.

37:33.137 --> 37:37.413
- Look, you just leave him
in a box truck in that old park.

37:37.413 --> 37:41.068
- I can't do that.
- Sam, please.

37:41.068 --> 37:43.103
- I'm sorry, okay?
I gotta go.

37:43.103 --> 37:44.655
- Sam!
- I gotta go.

37:44.655 --> 37:47.034
- No, Sam, Sam,
I'm gonna bring the truck there.

37:47.034 --> 37:49.310
I'm gonna park it.
I'll be there in an hour, okay?

37:49.310 --> 37:51.379
The combination
for the lock is 3453.

37:51.379 --> 37:52.862
You just leave him
in there handcuffed

37:52.862 --> 37:55.275
- and I got the rest. Okay?
- I gotta go.

37:55.275 --> 37:57.620
- Sam, I'm gonna be there
in one hour!

38:03.517 --> 38:05.724
Where are you going?

38:05.724 --> 38:08.206
Out.

38:08.206 --> 38:09.758
You good?

38:09.758 --> 38:11.344
Yeah. I'm good

38:17.034 --> 38:20.620
Yo, is he good?

38:20.620 --> 38:23.413
Yeah.

38:27.413 --> 38:29.620
- So the Vice President
is secure?

38:29.620 --> 38:32.620
Yeah, that's why we're here.

38:32.620 --> 38:35.344
Okay.

38:35.344 --> 38:36.827
I'm just glad you're safe.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.586
- I"m just want all this
to be over with, you know?

38:54.586 --> 38:58.551
- Soon.
Just trust me.

39:09.344 --> 39:13.517
I'm sorry.
I can't take many questions.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.068
This has been a trying day.

39:16.068 --> 39:20.793
And I need to get
to the hospital to see my son.

39:20.793 --> 39:26.068
The truth is
the Vice President was right.

39:26.068 --> 39:30.482
There was a woman whose store
I shopped at once with my son.

39:32.586 --> 39:35.793
He loved going shopping with me.

39:35.793 --> 39:37.724
- She's really
spinning this shit.

39:37.724 --> 39:41.586
- And he became
infatuated with her.

39:41.586 --> 39:43.965
It was a day she came
to the White House

39:43.965 --> 39:45.724
to deliver some dresses.

39:51.310 --> 39:56.344
And he attacked her.
We had no idea.

39:56.344 --> 40:00.172
Gotta be kidding me.

40:00.172 --> 40:02.034
Yeah, what'd you expect?

40:02.034 --> 40:04.482
- And there was another
beautiful young woman

40:04.482 --> 40:08.965
who worked here
at this sacred place.

40:08.965 --> 40:11.655
My son also attacked her.

40:14.896 --> 40:20.551
Both women died
here at the White House.

40:20.551 --> 40:24.896
- You really are
a cold bitch, aren't you?

40:24.896 --> 40:28.275
- He's only 17 and I knew
he needed help.

40:28.275 --> 40:33.655
I had no idea it was this bad.

40:33.655 --> 40:35.482
My husband and I have been
about the business

40:35.482 --> 40:38.862
of running this country.

40:38.862 --> 40:41.482
Will this work?

40:41.482 --> 40:44.379
I don't know.

40:44.379 --> 40:46.827
My God, they are horrible.

40:48.965 --> 40:50.586
Yes, they are.

40:50.586 --> 40:52.206
And today...

40:52.206 --> 40:53.758
- Well, did we
underestimate them?

40:53.758 --> 40:56.172
- ...with him jumping
from the roof...

40:56.172 --> 41:00.379
We have the truth.

41:00.379 --> 41:05.068
- ...we are so remorseful that
we have

41:05.068 --> 41:07.448
failed this country.

41:07.448 --> 41:09.413
We truly didn't know.

41:09.413 --> 41:14.034
And for that,
we are so very sorry.

41:14.034 --> 41:16.068
Oh, shut up!

41:16.068 --> 41:18.689
And they all gonna
fall for this shit.

41:18.689 --> 41:21.586
They all gonna fall
for that shit.

41:21.586 --> 41:26.517
- I just, I just...
I think I'm gonna faint.

41:32.275 --> 41:36.034
She is so full of shit, man.

41:36.034 --> 41:37.793
Damn.

41:37.793 --> 41:40.862
- You don't believe
any of this, right?

41:40.862 --> 41:42.000
Do you?

41:43.413 --> 41:45.310
- ANNOUNCER:
Next on "The Oval"...

41:45.310 --> 41:46.655
They're gone.

41:48.724 --> 41:51.586
- How was it?
- Wicked.

41:51.586 --> 41:53.551
- I have you in here
on a federal warrant...

41:53.551 --> 41:55.275
This is bullshit!

41:55.275 --> 41:56.793
- ...signed by
the Vice President.

41:56.793 --> 41:59.965
- We have them on the ropes.
All we have to do

41:59.965 --> 42:01.448
is keep the pressure on.

42:01.448 --> 42:03.068
Damn, he looks bad.

42:03.068 --> 42:06.137
- Yeah, that's what happens
when you fall several stories.

42:06.137 --> 42:08.827
- This is DC police.
They're saying they have

42:08.827 --> 42:11.620
a Kareem Richardson there.
He's saying that his girlfriend

42:11.620 --> 42:13.000
was kidnapped by the President.
