WEBVTT

00:29.763 --> 00:31.401
You can't hide, maggot!

00:32.665 --> 00:34.645
You're going to get
what's coming to you.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.607
And you're going to get it now.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.856
There's nowhere to go.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.953
You can't hide from me.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.761
Got you.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.843
Truck was on its usual route,
the Southeast.

02:23.910 --> 02:28.120
Driver said the rear loader got jammed.
Got out to take a look. Found the body.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.660
How many stops did he
make before he got here?

02:29.749 --> 02:32.559
He's not sure. He started
at 6:30 this morning.

02:32.619 --> 02:36.089
Luckily he found it before it got to the
dump, otherwise he would have never been
found.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.932
Can we roll the body? Well,
I already took photos.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.939
Evidence is pretty well contaminated,
so yeah, we can take a few liberties here.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.201
Let's roll him.

02:48.601 --> 02:49.875
Ooh.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.753
What do you think killed him?

03:12.625 --> 03:15.037
Leonard Lewis Drake, age 30.

03:15.094 --> 03:19.338
Last known address, 841 Southeast
Long Street, apartment 201.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.937
Couple of assaults, DUI and
three domestic violence charges.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.209
Sounds like your basic bully. Yeah.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.009
That address is on the
trash truck's route.

03:28.074 --> 03:30.076
Time for a little dumpster diving.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.219
Got some blood in here.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.225
Yeah. Time to bring in the team.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.519
More blood here.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.565
Need Forensics along the
800 block of Long Street.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.164
Looks like he was dragged along
the sidewalk after he was killed.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.970
841 Southeast Long Street.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.199
Leonard Drake's address.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.276
There's more blood on the ramp.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.041
Time to get the manager.

03:56.369 --> 04:00.340
One space per tenant All
but two units are rented.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.283
We got 25 units.

04:02.542 --> 04:07.218
Most of the people are away at
work right now, as you can see.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.252
You know, we get more police
here than I'd like to admit.

04:11.684 --> 04:15.962
But you know some of our tenants,
they, um.. They have problems.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.660
Was Leonard Drake one of them?

04:17.724 --> 04:20.067
What's he done? He died.

04:20.860 --> 04:24.637
What? Yeah. Sometime last night.

04:25.064 --> 04:27.169
Oh, my God. Oh, that's terrible.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.678
When was the last time
you talked to him?

04:28.735 --> 04:30.078
Well, he was here last night.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.583
He was having a fight with Mason,
one of the other tenants.

04:34.507 --> 04:37.078
Hey, Natalie didn't get hurt,
did she? Who's Natalie?

04:37.143 --> 04:40.215
Oh, that's Lenny's live-in.
Great gal.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.990
Not such great taste in men, you know,
not to speak ill of the dead.

04:45.051 --> 04:48.589
Natalie have a last name? Haverstraw,
but she's not home.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.499
Her car's gone. That's her space.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.231
And that's Lenny's car,
the Mustang,

04:54.294 --> 04:58.037
but I guess he's not
here either. Anymore.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.235
We're going to need
the names of everyone

05:01.301 --> 05:02.974
in the building and all
their vehicle plates.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.514
How did Lenny die?

05:05.805 --> 05:08.115
He was murdered. Oh, wow.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.245
I did not expect that...

05:10.310 --> 05:14.224
and I'm not totally surprised
because he wasn't the nicest guy.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.652
What about Mason? The tenant who
you said had a fight with Lenny.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.754
Oh. That's Mason Snyder, yeah.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.628
He's a lawyer. Lives
down the hall from Lenny.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.899
Oh, that's his car over there.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.866
We're going to need to
see Lenny's apartment.

05:49.982 --> 05:53.395
Got tools. Murder
weapon could be Lenny's.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.023
Looks like Natalie left in a hurry.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.965
Let's get her plate and APB her.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.840
Need to get a team in here,
see if there's any blood on the rug.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.534
Pretty. I wonder
what she saw in him.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.179
Love's a funny thing.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.607
He must be laughing all the time.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.729
Police! Open up.

06:32.892 --> 06:37.739
All I did was ask him why did he have to
take that engine apart on the kitchen table.

06:37.797 --> 06:40.778
What he say? Nothing.

06:40.833 --> 06:45.373
He just... He had been drinking,
and he stood up, and he hit me.

06:45.671 --> 06:46.945
And then what happened?

06:47.006 --> 06:52.046
I told him that I'd had enough, and I
went to the bedroom and started packing,

06:52.111 --> 06:55.456
and then he came after
me and he grabbed me,

06:55.515 --> 06:59.224
and I think that he would have killed me,
if it hadn't been for Marty.

06:59.952 --> 07:03.661
Um, Marty is our downstairs neighbor.
He lives right below us.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.760
That would be Martin
Burgess in 101?

07:05.958 --> 07:11.374
Yeah. He, uh... He
always heard everything.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.808
And what did Martin do?

07:12.865 --> 07:14.139
He knocked on the door,

07:14.767 --> 07:17.646
and then that's what stopped Lenny,

07:17.703 --> 07:22.413
and then I felt afraid for Marty
because Lenny started yelling at him,

07:22.475 --> 07:23.818
and then that's when
Mason showed up.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.880
Mason Snyder,
who lives across the hall?

07:25.945 --> 07:30.519
Yeah. And then they got into it
and Lenny threatened to kill him.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.618
And then where was Martin?

07:31.684 --> 07:34.790
He left when Mason and Lenny
were yelling at each other.

07:35.588 --> 07:39.035
And then I went and I got my stuff

07:39.759 --> 07:41.295
and Lenny tried to stop me,

07:41.360 --> 07:47.038
but Mason walked me to my car, so that
he couldn't, and then I drove to Astoria

07:47.099 --> 07:48.840
and checked into a motel and...

07:51.571 --> 07:52.982
What did Lenny say happened?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.418
Lenny was murdered last night.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.094
I don't believe that.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.788
We found his body this morning.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.424
Mason killed him? We don't know.

08:09.455 --> 08:12.163
You think that I did it? Did you?

08:13.092 --> 08:16.073
No, I... How could I?
I'm not strong enough.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.204
People can do a lot of
things when they're mad.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.039
I hated him. I wouldn't kill him.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.645
Do you know anyone else who would?

08:22.702 --> 08:25.308
Yeah, like anybody
who ever met him.

08:25.371 --> 08:26.372
Why did you stay?

08:28.074 --> 08:30.281
At first he was

08:33.078 --> 08:34.080
Pretty great.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.424
And then the longer we were together,
the worse it got.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.226
I don't know, I guess

08:43.054 --> 08:45.626
I was just too scared to leave.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.471
Think she could put a screwdriver
through a man's throat?

08:51.564 --> 08:53.669
Hey. Hey, love's a funny thing.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.871
Any witnesses to the argument?

08:54.934 --> 08:57.346
Two guys from the building,
Marty Burgess and Mason Snyder.

08:57.403 --> 09:00.748
Marty Burgess owns a junk yard on the
East Side called Marty's Junk Shop.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.285
What about Snyder?

09:02.441 --> 09:03.784
Personal injury lawyer.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.754
Start with the junk shop.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.026
Hello!

09:22.862 --> 09:25.934
Maybe he's in the back.
I hate places like this.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.409
Oh, why? It's just stuff.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.742
No, it's people's
lives falling apart.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.348
What's left when the
good times are over.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.220
It's the death of dreams.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.152
Thanks. Now I'm creeped out.

09:46.852 --> 09:47.853
Mr. Burgess?

09:49.522 --> 09:50.796
Sorry. We didn't mean to scare you.

09:50.890 --> 09:53.962
Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.
We just want to ask you a few questions.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.665
About what?

09:55.728 --> 09:59.107
Your neighbor, Leonard Drake.
He was murdered sometime last night.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.907
Murdered? According
to Natalie Haverstraw,

10:01.968 --> 10:04.073
you were one of the last
people to see him alive.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.716
Well, if... If it
happened last night,

10:07.807 --> 10:09.377
I guess I was.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.587
I don't really know
what I can tell you.

10:14.246 --> 10:18.217
I heard another argument between Mr.
Drake and Miss Haverstraw.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.491
I was afraid that he
might hurt her again.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.861
I walked up and knocked on the door,
but Natalie wasn't...

10:29.528 --> 10:31.474
Is she okay? She's fine.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.908
What did you do then? Nothing.

10:36.235 --> 10:40.445
I should have, but Mr.
Drake was very angry at me.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.782
What did you think of him?
Truthfully?

10:43.909 --> 10:47.220
He was a terrible man.
He scared me.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.492
Now, was your neighbor Mason
Snyder involved in the argument?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.763
Yeah. He got there after I did.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.062
Can you describe the relationship
between Snyder and Drake?

10:57.123 --> 10:58.466
I don't know.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.370
Mr. Drake was hard on everyone.

11:05.031 --> 11:09.480
I think that he must have had a very
difficult life to turn out so mean.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.987
I felt kind of bad for Mr. Drake.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.325
And for Natalie too.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.062
Look, I don't know what
else I can tell you.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.567
What did you do after the argument?

11:31.657 --> 11:34.263
I went back to my apartment.
Anyone verify that?

11:34.794 --> 11:37.673
My father. He lives with me.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.973
Thank you, Mr. Burgess.
That's all for now. We'll be in touch.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.812
What'd I tell you?

11:47.873 --> 11:51.582
Living with all these shattered
dreams can turn your head inside out.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.680
Let's find Snyder.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.500
Leonard Drake was a complete ass.

12:46.565 --> 12:50.103
And trust me, I know
an ass when I see one.

12:50.169 --> 12:53.912
I've represented plenty of them.
But I didn't kill him.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.952
Yeah, we argued.
I told him to leave her alone.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.015
Um, and I told him to go to hell.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.892
What did Leonard do when you
walked Natalie to her car?

13:06.252 --> 13:07.925
He yelled.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.163
Excuse me, I got to take this.

13:12.758 --> 13:13.896
Mason Snyder.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.670
Listen to me.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.472
Mr. Mancini is going to be
limping for the rest of his life,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.980
and I'm not talking emotionally.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.612
No, he lost his leg, you idiot.

13:34.113 --> 13:38.721
No, no, no, you listen to me.
You multiply that number by 20,

13:39.318 --> 13:41.389
then we've got something
to talk about.

13:43.155 --> 13:47.831
So, what else you need to know?
Except I'm innocent.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.012
"After two days of
waiting in Vienna,

14:05.077 --> 14:08.524
"I confronted the
Lausenschlange in a dark alley.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.458
"As I approached, he attacked.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.793
"Had he recognized me for who I am,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.422
"he would not have been so bold.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.466
"His carelessness
cost him his head,

14:16.522 --> 14:18.798
"which I severed
neatly with one blow.

14:23.062 --> 14:28.136
"I sliced open his belly, exposing the
horrid contents of the missing children.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.279
"I'm glad I brought an end
to this disgusting coward.

14:31.337 --> 14:34.011
"I only wish I would
have found him sooner.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.243
"Crawford Grimm."

14:38.611 --> 14:40.989
- You ever seen one of these?
- A Mauzhertz.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.451
Pretty favorable likeness actually,
given the subject.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.860
Well, I think I saw one and he
could be involved in a murder.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.857
There's a reason you people
never wrote about them.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.731
They never do anything
worth writing about.

14:51.790 --> 14:56.239
This whole cartoon thing they
got going, such a racket.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.433
So they're harmless? Yeah.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.503
I mean you say "Boo" and they
scurry off to their safety zones.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.377
They're very predictable that way.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.349
What about a Lausenschlange?
Lausenschlange?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.750
You saw a snake dude and
lived to tell about it?

15:09.808 --> 15:10.946
Let me tell you,
what you don't want to do

15:11.010 --> 15:13.456
is leave a Lausenschlange
alone with a Mauzhertz.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.924
That is a recipe for dessert.

15:15.981 --> 15:19.895
Mmm. Excuse me a second.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.223
Monroe.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.431
Absolutely. I know it well.

15:26.492 --> 15:31.168
I think it's... I think it's an E.
Howard & Company mechanism out of Boston.

15:31.630 --> 15:35.009
Yeah, I can handle that No
timepiece too big or too small.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.614
I'm sorry. Can you...
Can you hold a minute?

15:38.370 --> 15:40.111
It's a gig. I got a gig.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.174
That's good. I have to go anyway.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.583
Yeah, go ahead. So what time?

15:47.046 --> 15:51.791
12:30 tomorrow. No, thank you.
Yeah, I'll see you then.

15:54.386 --> 15:55.421
Awesome.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.792
They were parked across the
street right over there.

15:57.856 --> 16:01.599
One of them was taking pictures of our
house. The other one had binoculars.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.667
Huh. Well, maybe they
were real estate agents.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.177
They drove off when
I went out there.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.138
You went out there?

16:10.202 --> 16:13.240
Yeah, somebody's taking pictures
of our house. I want to know why.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.343
Look, I got the license plate
number so we can find out who it is.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.414
Better safe than sorry.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.495
Yeah, this is Detective Burkhardt.
I want you to run a plate for me.

16:27.686 --> 16:31.998
O-R-7-3-4-B-F-U. Yeah, thanks.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.663
Look, I'm sure it was
probably nothing serious.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.465
Stay inside.

16:47.973 --> 16:48.974
Stay inside.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.167
Don't arrest him. He's just hungry.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.146
Yeah, well, he's a rodent.

17:19.671 --> 17:22.151
And he should be eating
what rodents eat.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.877
He isn't a rodent.
We're all mammals here.

17:25.176 --> 17:28.089
Well, I am not eating
what he's eating.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.854
Sure you are.
You just got to it first.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.325
Okay, smarty pants.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.437
Yeah, Burkhardt.
Yeah, let me get a pen.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.966
All right, John Oblinger.

17:46.665 --> 17:49.874
643 Lovejoy. Thank you.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.244
Got a name and address
on the truck you saw.

17:53.305 --> 17:55.785
So what do we do? Okay,
we don't do anything.

17:56.842 --> 18:00.483
I'll have somebody take care of it.
Let's go to bed.

18:06.218 --> 18:09.688
Look, it's your word against mine.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.757
And I got four
little words for you.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.201
Take me to court!

18:15.094 --> 18:17.301
Now get the hell out of my sight!

18:30.776 --> 18:35.225
I thought I told you to
get the hell out of my...

18:58.537 --> 19:01.643
Victim's name is Andrew Salazar.
That's his auto repair.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.015
Two dumpsters, two dead bodies.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.180
We may not have motive,
but we sure got pattern.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.053
Lucky it wasn't Tuesday.
Tuesday's trash day.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.490
We could have been digging
through garbage out at the dump.

19:09.548 --> 19:10.959
Who found him?

19:11.016 --> 19:13.519
Archie Wayne, one of the mechanics.
First to show up this morning.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.531
Said he found the place open.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.959
Any sign of a break-in?

19:17.022 --> 19:19.730
No. He was dumping the trash
when he found the vic.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.860
He thinks it might have
been a disgruntled customer.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.339
Apparently his boss was a terror.
Nobody liked him.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.706
He said, and I quote,

19:26.765 --> 19:29.974
"I'm surprised somebody didn't stick
a tire iron in him before this."

19:30.035 --> 19:31.207
Actually, that was a paraphrase.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.250
I left out the bad language because
I couldn't write that fast.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.148
All right, we're going to need
all the customer records from

19:35.207 --> 19:36.208
the last couple of months.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.618
Yeah. On it.

19:37.676 --> 19:41.146
If this is the same killer, maybe this
victim is connected to our first vic.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.989
And if it's not, then our killer's
making some random choices.

20:26.592 --> 20:29.835
Hi. Excuse me.
I'm... I'm here for the...

21:16.908 --> 21:18.649
Get in the house. What?

21:44.369 --> 21:46.645
Marty. Hey.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.313
I was worried about you.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.345
Are you packing? Yeah, I...

21:54.046 --> 21:55.957
I can't stay here. Oh.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.759
I don't blame you.

22:00.552 --> 22:05.194
I didn't... I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.561
If it wasn't for you
knocking on the door,

22:07.626 --> 22:09.902
I don't know what would
have happened to me.

22:10.696 --> 22:11.731
Oh.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.650
You've always been
really nice to me.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.216
Where are you going? I don't know.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.689
I... I have to finish out my
week at the office, and then

22:28.413 --> 22:31.053
I'm just going to start
over someplace new.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.361
Oh. Someplace else.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.493
But when I'm gone,
would you do me a favor

22:37.556 --> 22:40.935
and take all of Lenny's stuff
to your shop and just sell it?

22:41.927 --> 22:44.373
I don't ever want to see it again.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.803
Okay, Okay?

22:48.567 --> 22:50.604
By the way, how's your dad?

22:51.903 --> 22:53.007
About the same.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.477
I know that must be hard on you,
having to take care of him.

22:58.577 --> 23:02.525
All right, out of the way.
Men at work here.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.925
Mason's helping me move.

23:05.016 --> 23:08.054
Yeah. I'm just helping
the little lady move.

23:34.045 --> 23:37.549
She's mine, and so are you.

25:09.641 --> 25:11.621
We got something here. What's up?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.121
Martin Burgess.

25:14.646 --> 25:18.719
Junk shop guy. Had his car
repaired last week. $1,200.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.124
We should find out where
he was last night.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.790
Let's ask his dad.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.096
He moved in with Marty
a long time ago.

25:26.157 --> 25:29.138
He's lived with him for years
ever since he broke his back.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.801
He's not exactly the nicest
man I've ever met in my life.

25:35.166 --> 25:39.444
Mr. Burgess, there's two policemen
here need to talk to you.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.449
Is that incense? Smells like it.

25:43.775 --> 25:46.119
Mr. Burgess, it's the police.
We're coming in.

25:54.753 --> 25:57.029
God. A hoarder.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.396
How do you live like this?

26:22.881 --> 26:25.327
Smells like more than just incense.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.693
He's been dead at least two days.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.792
No signs of trauma.
Except maybe to Marty.

27:08.326 --> 27:10.932
- Maybe this is what set him off.
- Or set him free.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.837
How do you mean?

27:13.898 --> 27:18.347
Marty's 40. Never been married.
He's taken care of his dad all these years.

27:19.838 --> 27:22.978
Maybe the father-son relationship
wasn't all that great.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.850
He never had a chance
to deal with it.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.656
I think he's dealing with it now.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.428
Listen to me very closely,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.558
do not take off the
neck brace, period.

27:37.622 --> 27:42.093
Do not go to the gym.
Do not mow your lawn.

27:42.327 --> 27:46.969
You were seriously injured by that bus.
Now start acting like it.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.840
What the hell are you doing here?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.316
You should leave Natalie
alone. Excuse me?

27:58.576 --> 28:02.388
I want you to leave her alone.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.786
Are you asking to die?

28:05.617 --> 28:08.427
Because if you are,
you came to the right place.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.660
Let's get something straight,

28:10.722 --> 28:14.101
you don't tell me what to do.
I tell you.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.472
That's just the way of this world.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.744
You are never going to be
any more than what you are.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.509
A little rodent,
with a little rodent's life.

28:36.448 --> 28:40.624
You are pathetic.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.997
Birthmark loser.

28:46.391 --> 28:51.067
You are never going to amount
to any more than what you are...

28:54.365 --> 28:55.901
...which is nothing.

28:58.169 --> 28:59.443
Nothing at all.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.330
Marty?

29:25.730 --> 29:27.209
You brought me flowers?

29:27.398 --> 29:29.378
Beautiful flowers for
a beautiful woman.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.646
Thank you.

29:34.839 --> 29:37.979
They're lovely. ls Mason here?

29:38.877 --> 29:41.448
He couldn't make it.
Isn't that his car?

29:43.748 --> 29:44.988
I bought it.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.121
You bought Mason's Camaro?

29:48.319 --> 29:50.424
I made us a reservation for dinner.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.900
We should celebrate.
Celebrate what?

29:52.957 --> 29:56.996
You're leaving. You're
starting a new life. So am I.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.939
I can't believe he sold you his car.
He loves this car.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.408
It was a little more
than he could handle.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.525
Yeah. Burkhardt.
We need to palaver.

30:16.581 --> 30:18.652
You don't sound so good.
Are you all right?

30:18.716 --> 30:19.786
I've been better.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.922
I'm in the middle of
something here. Can it wait?

30:21.986 --> 30:24.796
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.072
We got Marty Burgess's car. Where?

30:30.128 --> 30:32.404
Parked in front of an
office building on Grand.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.780
We have a 20 on Martin Burgess?

30:39.838 --> 30:40.976
No, sir, just the car.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.781
This is the lawyer's office.
HANK: What's Marty got against him?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.185
Well, if he's killed two people

30:45.243 --> 30:47.917
and he's living with his dead dad,
I don't think it matters.

30:54.252 --> 30:58.029
Going to need an evidence team
at 5431 Grand Ave., suite 204.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.035
Marty's car's here and Marty isn't.

31:00.091 --> 31:01.536
We better find that Camaro.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.902
I'm very sorry, sir.
We're completely booked.

31:07.966 --> 31:11.470
Without a reservation there's
no way we can get you a table.

31:12.770 --> 31:16.547
I'm sure you'll find a reservation
under the name of Burgess.

31:17.909 --> 31:19.684
Certainly, Mr. Burgess. This way.

31:24.749 --> 31:27.593
I was thinking Seattle.
Or maybe Vancouver.

31:27.652 --> 31:31.259
Really? I just
thought maybe Eugene.

31:31.322 --> 31:34.895
No. You got to think bigger,
Natalie.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.904
The only thing that's
holding you back is you.

31:38.162 --> 31:42.406
You're smart. You're pretty.
You can do anything you want.

31:43.134 --> 31:44.875
I wish that was true.

31:44.936 --> 31:48.145
Oh, it is. We make our own truth.

31:48.806 --> 31:51.650
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.059
What about your dad?
Are you going to take him with you?

31:58.249 --> 32:01.230
No. I can't.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.860
I can't live my life
for him anymore.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.202
I've got to do this for myself.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.634
That's amazing. What?

32:11.062 --> 32:14.305
I don't know. You just seem
like a different person.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.576
Maybe you're just getting to
know me a little bit better.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.547
- Cool.
- Stop it.

32:23.241 --> 32:26.222
Stop it right now.
Honey, please not now.

32:26.811 --> 32:29.587
You embarrass me.
You should grow up.

32:30.815 --> 32:31.953
Oh, oh, great, great.

32:32.016 --> 32:34.155
So now we're going to
get the tears, huh?

32:34.218 --> 32:36.596
And that's going to make
everything better, isn't it?

32:37.255 --> 32:39.531
Listen, young man,
you start acting like a grown up

32:39.590 --> 32:42.127
or I swear I will stick
you in a child's seat.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.501
You hear me?

32:44.662 --> 32:47.734
I asked you a question
and I expect an answer.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.745
Marty. Stop it.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.446
Who the hell do you think you are?

32:57.442 --> 33:00.787
Talk to him that way again
and you'll find out.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.753
Get away from me.

33:07.085 --> 33:08.587
Dad! Honey.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.966
Dad, are you all right?

33:14.792 --> 33:17.602
Marty, I think we should go.
Marty, come on.

33:47.992 --> 33:52.372
What you did for that little boy was...
It was actually pretty great.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.470
I had a dad like that.
He scared the hell out of me.

33:59.604 --> 34:00.844
People like that...

34:03.174 --> 34:04.551
They deserve to die.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.266
Marty, I think you
should slow down.

34:20.158 --> 34:21.899
Okay, Marty, you're going too fast.

34:23.761 --> 34:26.400
I've gone too slow my whole life.

34:27.297 --> 34:30.938
Not anymore. Not ever again.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.226
Marty! Marty, you have
to stop for the police!

34:48.286 --> 34:50.857
Marty! Marty, please stop!

34:57.328 --> 34:58.466
Stop the car!

35:00.865 --> 35:01.866
Stop!

35:11.042 --> 35:12.919
Hey. Got the Camaro.

35:12.977 --> 35:16.151
Patrol car was in pursuit but
lost it heading north on 17th.

35:16.214 --> 35:19.423
North on 17th?
He's going to his shop.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.894
How do you know?
That's his safety zone.

35:29.260 --> 35:32.366
What are we doing here? Marty,
I want to go home.

35:33.097 --> 35:34.132
Marty!

35:36.134 --> 35:39.980
Marty, Marty,
please stop it. Stop it.

35:40.037 --> 35:43.075
They all want me to change back,
but I won't.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.782
I like the way that I am now.
Marty, please. Stop it.

35:49.747 --> 35:50.748
Stop!

36:05.229 --> 36:08.472
Found suspect's car at
742 Germantown Road.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.210
Request backup.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.274
He's got Natalie with him.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.623
Marty!

36:23.881 --> 36:26.191
It's Detectives
Burkhardt and Griffin!

36:26.250 --> 36:28.560
I'm here! Help me!

36:53.311 --> 36:56.622
Marty, we need you
to let Natalie go.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.394
Give yourself up.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.428
Don't hurt her, Marty.

37:03.154 --> 37:05.225
She hasn't done anything to you.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.366
Marty, look at what you're doing.

37:40.324 --> 37:41.428
Natalie's your friend.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.132
Let her go.

37:44.695 --> 37:48.438
No. No. No.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.273
No. No.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.916
No, I am not you.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.073
Oh. my God!

39:06.944 --> 39:09.925
We found your father.
We know he's dead.

39:10.981 --> 39:12.392
No, he's not.

39:13.284 --> 39:16.527
He was. But he's not.

39:18.055 --> 39:21.764
You think he's dead,
but he's everywhere.

39:23.794 --> 39:27.833
No matter how many times you kill him.
He's everywhere.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.308
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

39:35.106 --> 39:37.814
I know who you are.
Oh, no, you don't.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.087
Nobody does.

39:41.612 --> 39:42.989
Nobody knows me.

39:46.450 --> 39:50.398
Nobody does. Nobody.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.503
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.301
You went over there?

40:00.364 --> 40:03.277
I just wanted to drive by and see
where they lived, that's all.

40:04.769 --> 40:06.373
Juliette, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

40:06.437 --> 40:08.781
I didn't do anything. I just parked,
but then I saw the woman

40:08.839 --> 40:12.013
and I'm pretty sure it was the same woman
that was in the truck outside our house.

40:12.643 --> 40:13.986
Well, did she see you? Yeah.

40:14.044 --> 40:15.580
And that's when it
got really weird.

40:15.646 --> 40:18.252
She had two kids in the front
yard and as soon as she saw me,

40:18.315 --> 40:21.057
she got those kids into the
house as fast as she could.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.688
I think she was afraid of me.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.891
Well, what did you do?

40:23.954 --> 40:26.833
Nothing. I just looked at her.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.531
Why would she be afraid of me?
I don't even know who they are.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.937
Well, maybe she thought that
you were someone you weren't.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.671
I wish I knew who
they thought I was.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.978
At least I know who you are.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.274
Ooh. What happened to you?

41:08.699 --> 41:13.079
Funny you should ask.
You happened to me. Get in here.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.146
Shut the door, will you?

41:23.948 --> 41:25.450
Who did this to you?

41:26.317 --> 41:28.923
I can track them down I don't know.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.296
Look, I don't know who
these guys were. All right?

41:31.355 --> 41:34.529
All I know is if they wanted me dead,
I would be dead.

41:35.392 --> 41:40.705
So I can only imagine they were
sending me some kind of message.

41:44.702 --> 41:47.774
You ever see that before? Yeah.

41:50.074 --> 41:51.485
Reapers.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.317
You start messing
with the status quo,

41:53.377 --> 41:56.847
there are some people who might not
be exactly sanguine about that.

41:57.381 --> 42:01.056
And what I am doing with you is
definitely messing with the status quo.

42:08.092 --> 42:10.231
I'm not going to ask for
any more of your help.

42:11.428 --> 42:12.839
Screw that.

42:14.732 --> 42:15.938
I'm not running.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.677
You ask me for all
the help you need.

42:22.439 --> 42:24.976
I've never been much of a
status quo kind of guy.

42:26.944 --> 42:30.721
And next time,
we'll be ready for them.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
