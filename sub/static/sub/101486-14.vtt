10:26.184 --> 10:28.701
Ah, Elin,
I thought I'd find you dancing.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.204
Yes, I'm exactly as I seem.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.798
-Well, I--
-Quiet! (sniffs)

10:33.967 --> 10:35.525
Someone's getting clicks.

10:35.694 --> 10:38.619

from America's heartland.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.254
Up-bup-bup!

Not on my white furniture,

(cheering, applause)

10:50.817 --> 10:51.875
(louder cheering)

10:52.043 --> 10:53.634
Not loud enough!
Not loud enough!

10:53.654 --> 10:55.044
Don't make me make you dance!

10:55.213 --> 10:57.230
(murmuring)

10:57.324 --> 10:59.306
Get me a new audience.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.784
(all screaming)

11:05.891 --> 11:07.223
Howdy do, Elin?

11:07.392 --> 11:09.817
You sure do look different
in person than you do

11:09.911 --> 11:11.986
in them<i> Finding Nemo</i> movies.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.230
(laughs) You know, Cletus,
I've heard your fans

11:14.399 --> 11:16.157
will do anything you say.

11:16.325 --> 11:18.234
Oh, that can't be true.

11:18.327 --> 11:20.327
-Try it.
-Nah, go on.

11:20.496 --> 11:22.329
It's my show. Do as I say.

11:22.424 --> 11:26.167
Well, Elin, we got ourselves
a police chief

11:26.261 --> 11:28.169
in our town
by the name of Wiggum.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.763
Now, I ain't got nothing
agin him, mind you,

11:30.857 --> 11:34.567
but if you is my fans, here's
what I want you to do to him.

11:36.421 --> 11:38.846
Something is going on here.

11:39.015 --> 11:40.606
Something weird.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.184
Okay, help. Police!

11:43.278 --> 11:46.162
(sighs) Never a cop around
when you need one.

11:51.453 --> 11:53.211
Well, I want to thank you,
my friend.

11:53.362 --> 11:54.879
You changed my life.

11:55.106 --> 11:57.364
I was nothing but a zero
when I met you,

11:57.533 --> 11:59.884
but now I'm ten times that.

12:00.036 --> 12:01.368
Come here, you.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.430
(grunting)

12:06.209 --> 12:08.143
Homer, stand up.

12:09.804 --> 12:12.138
I want you to know
that I'm firing you

12:12.307 --> 12:14.715
and I'm replacing you
with a professional.

12:14.809 --> 12:16.901
Aw, nothing ever good happens
when you talk

12:17.128 --> 12:19.279
to the person sitting
next to you on an airplane.

12:24.227 --> 12:25.910
Uh, Homer, this here is a feller

12:26.062 --> 12:28.413
what wants to be my new manager.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.823
-And you're letting him?
-Yeah, I don't know why.

12:30.992 --> 12:33.643
There's just, there's something
about him, you know?

12:33.812 --> 12:36.087
Cletus, Cletus.

12:36.314 --> 12:38.314
Listen to how I say this.

12:38.407 --> 12:40.925
It's something everyone says,
but when I say it,

12:41.094 --> 12:45.412
you will never hear it like this
as long as you live.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.414
I make it very special.

12:47.509 --> 12:48.433
How are you?

12:48.660 --> 12:50.918
Ooh, I just got goose bumps.

12:51.012 --> 12:52.270
Say it again.

12:52.497 --> 12:54.998
No. Listen to me. I love you.

12:55.016 --> 12:56.775
I am in love with you.
This is real.

12:57.002 --> 12:59.335
Once you sign with me,
you can call me up at 3:00

12:59.428 --> 13:01.112
in the morning-- I won't be mad.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.007
I'll say, "What's wrong, boobie?
I love you."

13:04.025 --> 13:07.193
-(whoops)
-I can't believe you're thinking
of signing with him.

13:07.362 --> 13:09.788
The way you changed my life
when we were in jail?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.289
That means nothing to you?

13:11.516 --> 13:14.400
My friend, what happens in jail
stays in jail.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.960
Unless it's breaking
out of jail.

13:16.187 --> 13:18.354
Well, all I have to offer
is my friendship

13:18.447 --> 13:20.948
and the fact that you wouldn't
be here if not for me.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.359
That's your closer?
That's pitiful.

13:23.452 --> 13:24.952
I don't love you.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.196
Here's my closer. Spuckman!

13:27.365 --> 13:28.455
Duffman?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.957
Now I'm Spuckman.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.202
Because Duff replaced me
with a hard-partying cat.

13:33.296 --> 13:34.962
Me-ow!

13:35.056 --> 13:37.223
Clifford, we're gonna
market your dreck

13:37.317 --> 13:40.209
as "Spuckler Family Moonshine,"
internationally.

13:40.378 --> 13:41.802
We'll say it's made by people

13:41.896 --> 13:45.472
who actually wash their hands
voluntarily,

13:45.492 --> 13:47.308
not 'cause of some sign.

13:47.402 --> 13:50.386
Hey, man, mine's all brewed
from pure mountain water

13:50.479 --> 13:52.738
from out behind
the DuPont factory.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.648
I'm going to assume
that's a joke.

13:54.742 --> 13:56.059
(laughs)

13:56.227 --> 13:57.669
But fun's for another time.

13:57.896 --> 14:00.580
We're gonna make you bigger
than Campbell's Soup.

14:00.748 --> 14:03.324
Not tomato or chicken noodle.
That would be impossible.

14:03.492 --> 14:05.735
But there's one of them
where they put in potatoes.

14:05.828 --> 14:07.253
We'll make you bigger than that.

14:07.405 --> 14:09.663
Now, why don't you pick
one of these Hollywood actresses

14:09.832 --> 14:11.498
to play your wife
in the commercial?

14:11.709 --> 14:13.184
Anyone you want. Just pick.

14:13.411 --> 14:15.502
Oh, I like this one.

14:15.597 --> 14:17.171
Oh, she'll never work with you.

14:17.340 --> 14:18.339
Pick an ugly one.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.191
Well, what about Brandine?

14:20.418 --> 14:22.509
Aw, she'll always be
my first love

14:22.604 --> 14:24.937
and second cousin.
(exhales)

14:25.090 --> 14:27.106
Well, this was
a very good meeting.

14:27.258 --> 14:29.108
And welcome to UPM.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.444
Here's a blank page-- sign it.

14:31.596 --> 14:33.187
We'll fill in the rest.

14:33.281 --> 14:35.022
Give me a hug.

14:35.191 --> 14:36.933
No, that's not a hug.

14:37.026 --> 14:38.692
A Hollywood hug.

14:38.861 --> 14:41.528
-Get him off. Get him off!
-(Cletus groans)

14:41.697 --> 14:45.967
And now your picture goes up
on our wall of fame.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.279
Bert and Ernie? I don't even
think they're living.

14:50.373 --> 14:52.782
Hey, IMDb Bert and Ernie,
will you?

14:52.951 --> 14:54.300
Do puppets die?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.227
Hey, why does the Pope have
no merchandise?

14:56.379 --> 14:58.804
Can't we come up with a little
doohickey you put on your desk

14:58.973 --> 15:01.774
that blows a colored smoke when
you're picked for something?

15:02.810 --> 15:05.052
Everything he taught me
was a lie.

15:05.146 --> 15:07.647
Maybe, but think
what you became.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.315
A better husband.

15:09.484 --> 15:10.816
A better father.

15:10.985 --> 15:12.652
You can still be one.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.819
Nah.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.822
<i> Hmm. Why are my eyes burnin'?</i>

15:16.917 --> 15:18.658
I'm just whippin' up
another batch

15:18.826 --> 15:20.826
of my homemade family brew.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.756
Let my longtime corporate
mascot tell you all about it.

15:24.983 --> 15:27.091
Spuckler Family Moonshine.

15:27.318 --> 15:30.077
Lovingly distilled
in the heart of America.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.338
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i> Spuckler Family Moonshine</i>
<i> is distilled in Finland.</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:34.599
<i> Not a single American</i>
<i>was employed in its manufacture.</i>

15:34.826 --> 15:35.934
(TV clicks off)

15:36.161 --> 15:37.810
(groans)

15:40.331 --> 15:42.682
You have to help him
get back to his family.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.818
Forget it. I'm through with
those slack-jawed, no-account...

15:46.004 --> 15:50.431
examples of America
at its finest.

15:50.525 --> 15:52.433
He was a great man
until you ruint him.

15:52.527 --> 15:54.619
With your promises
of short underwear

15:54.846 --> 15:56.287
and professional haircuts.

15:56.514 --> 15:58.605
You think you can play God,

15:58.700 --> 16:00.792
wreck my life,
and then just walk away?

16:00.961 --> 16:03.686
First of all,
I wasn't playing God.

16:03.779 --> 16:05.630
I was doing
an original character.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.966
Don't worry, we'll fix this.

16:08.193 --> 16:10.193
I don't know how, but we will.

16:10.286 --> 16:13.362
Unless Homer decides to
disregard my wishes completely.

16:13.531 --> 16:15.031
Hmm.

16:15.124 --> 16:16.532
Don't take time!

16:16.625 --> 16:18.393
All right.

16:22.298 --> 16:23.773
(doorbell rings)

16:24.967 --> 16:28.044
What the--?
Aw, I thought we was quits.

16:28.137 --> 16:30.213
Listen, pal,
you've ruined your life.

16:30.381 --> 16:33.049
You haven't just watched<i> A Star</i>
<i> Is Born,</i> you're living it.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.718
No, man.
<i> A Star Is Born</i> is about

16:35.811 --> 16:38.054
a star who fades
and then kills hisself.

16:38.223 --> 16:40.389
This here is much more like

16:40.558 --> 16:43.167
a nice guy
who's seduced by power,

16:43.353 --> 16:46.320
as in Elia Kazan's
<i> A Face in the Crowd.</i>

16:46.414 --> 16:48.231
Dang, that's a good'un.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.324
How do you know
so much about movies?

16:50.493 --> 16:52.902
Oh, well,
Brandine and I once squatted

16:52.995 --> 16:55.162
inside an abandoned Blockbuster.

16:55.331 --> 16:59.559
That's where we conceived
our twins: Be Kind and Rewind.

17:00.836 --> 17:03.337
Forget that. You got to go
back home where you belong.

17:03.506 --> 17:05.672
Also, you owe me $27,000.

17:05.841 --> 17:09.009
Yeah, I'm afraid I donated that
to a children's hospital.

17:09.178 --> 17:10.677
You monster!

17:10.846 --> 17:12.938
Look, Cletus, this isn't you.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.681
What about your family?

17:14.850 --> 17:17.109
Well, my family now is
Carrie Underwood,

17:17.262 --> 17:19.945
Taylor Swift
and all of them Mumfords.

17:20.073 --> 17:23.690
And everyone in BTS,
except for Jungkook.

17:23.785 --> 17:26.860
(chuckles)
He's too pretty for my tastes.

17:27.029 --> 17:29.121
Cletus,
just answer me one thing:

17:29.215 --> 17:32.533

Don't talk. Just listen.

18:50.021 --> 18:52.371
You're gonna be a brand.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.207

Tell me your story.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.026
Not the person they see

18:57.195 --> 19:00.120
Well, my family didn't have
much money, and Daddy used to...

19:00.140 --> 19:02.198
That is so relatable.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.699
Not to me. I'm rich.

19:03.792 --> 19:06.369
But, God, I always wanted
to live in poverty.

19:06.462 --> 19:09.538
Now, all I ask is 15%
of your earnings for life.

19:09.632 --> 19:12.041
Not your whole life.
After 80, it's all yours.

19:12.134 --> 19:15.060
And when you retire, you're
gonna get a Netflix special.

19:15.229 --> 19:17.380
Actually, everybody gets
a Netflix special.

19:17.548 --> 19:18.805
Why do they even call them that?

19:18.933 --> 19:20.974
They should call them
Netflix normals.

You want a Netflix normal?
We'll get it for you.

19:23.738 --> 19:26.389

that's impossible.

You don't have to talk.

19:39.754 --> 19:42.755
Not unless you're getting paid
a million dollars a word.

19:42.907 --> 19:45.349
And some of those words
can be "a" or "the."

19:45.576 --> 19:47.852
Listen, never say "won't" again.

19:48.079 --> 19:50.855
Say "will not."
'Cause that's $2 million.

19:51.082 --> 19:52.839
That's a Bentley.

19:53.008 --> 19:55.026
Have you ever been interested
in a roofing company?

19:55.253 --> 19:56.843
You're very tall.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.604
You're much closer to roofs
than most people.

19:58.756 --> 20:00.364
(gasps) How about this?

20:00.516 --> 20:02.533
I can book you as a freak
in a monster movie.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.786
Or a dinosaur. You're as big
as a small dinosaur.

20:07.098 --> 20:09.373
We're trying to develop
an animated musical

20:09.600 --> 20:12.543
about the dinosaurs
that survived the comet.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.286
You could play a small dinosaur.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.880
You jump out from a tree.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.456
You sing a song.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.791
We've already got one written.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.718
It's called "I'm Still Here."

20:20.887 --> 20:22.628
Am I, am I reaching you?

20:22.797 --> 20:23.930
Just sign already.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.898
Okay. Looking for the next
musical superstar here.

20:34.383 --> 20:35.549
Uh, Barney,

20:36.051 --> 20:38.961
see what you can do
with this piccolo.

20:39.054 --> 20:40.312
(groans)

20:40.406 --> 20:43.632
Lady, you look like
a cellist to me.

20:43.726 --> 20:45.484
(grunting, muttering)

20:45.653 --> 20:47.136
-Forget that.
-(cello crashes)

20:47.229 --> 20:48.637
Jailbird, what about you?

20:48.731 --> 20:51.532
Um, I play the hacksaw.

20:51.659 --> 20:53.251
Hacksaw. Hacksaw.

20:53.478 --> 20:56.587
-Ah, here you go.
-All right!

20:56.739 --> 21:00.758
Uh, my first number is "We've
Gotta Get Out of This Place."

21:00.985 --> 21:04.169
I love it! Let me hear
that sweet, sweet sound.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.097
(hacksaw sawing)

21:06.324 --> 21:09.992
Ah, that is some
beautiful hacksawing.

21:10.011 --> 21:11.994
Ah, yeah.

21:12.013 --> 21:13.771
Soothing. Ooh!

21:13.940 --> 21:16.757
Soon, I'm gonna be doing
some sawing myself.

21:16.851 --> 21:18.759
Ah, yeah. (chuckles)

21:18.853 --> 21:20.653
Oh, yeah.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.361
Shh!
