00:07.132 --> 00:09.927
[Gerry] Okay, not high enough.
Okay?

00:18.853 --> 00:21.104
Hold on, I don't like this bat.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.784
Okay, you're pitching me
inside too much.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.078
[spits] Pretend.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.247
Shouldn't you be
teaching something? Or...

00:39.247 --> 00:40.666
Sheila, there's nobody
here, everybody's away.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.459
If I teach something
I gotta reteach it.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.253
I'm teaching baseball.
Keep your head up.
Time!

00:49.341 --> 00:51.218
For you, kid.

00:57.683 --> 01:01.770
It's a walk off. Goodnight.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.234

♪ I'm awesome ♪

01:22.541 --> 01:26.294
This is my favorite part
of the day, just right
before the kids get here.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.797
Spare, I like spare.

01:28.797 --> 01:33.552
Yup. Ah, here we go!
Dwyer's back.

01:33.552 --> 01:37.096
-[Lisa] Oh, that's Dwyer!
-[Trudy] The kids
call him Mr. D.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.975
-That's what they call me.
-No they don't

01:39.975 --> 01:43.062
-Yup.
-No, you might think
it's you, but it's Dwyer.

01:43.062 --> 01:47.232
Trudy, they're staring
right at me when they say Mr. D.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.778
No, no they aren't.
He's probably standing
right behind you.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.113
Shouldn't you be in the
office right now?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.740
Wow, the kids really
seem to like him.

01:54.740 --> 01:58.368
Oh, yeah, they really do,
you know?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.788
He's been here forever.
He's everybody's
favorite teacher.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.374
Everybody? So you know
every kid's favorite teacher?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.418
Some kids could have a different
favorite teacher, Trudy.

02:06.418 --> 02:09.296
No they don't,
no it's him.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.882
Everybody loves Mr. D.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.593
He has a way with
the kids, Gerry.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.345
[Gerry] Mr. D!

02:17.345 --> 02:21.016
Oops, hey!

02:22.183 --> 02:25.353
[Gerry] Hey, Mr. D!

-Give it up, Gerry.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.446
-You can't tell that's me.
-No, you can't tell.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.284
You say it,
that one was real.

02:40.995 --> 02:44.289
So the number of protons
determines what kind of
atom it is.

02:44.289 --> 02:48.251
Change the number of
protons and you get a
whole different element.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.421
[indistinct chatter]

02:52.923 --> 02:56.301
But now, let's talk about a
couple of fun little groups

02:56.301 --> 02:59.972
called isotopes and ions.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.599
Mr. Hunt, didn't you
promise to show us

03:02.599 --> 03:05.644
-how to make a bomb this week?
-[laughter]

03:05.644 --> 03:09.106
No, Colin, I never said
anything about making a bomb.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.985
-Put "make explosions"
on your to do list.
-[laughter]

03:12.985 --> 03:17.196
I won't do that,
this class is not about
blowing things up, Colin.

03:17.196 --> 03:20.075
Yeah, but this class
definitely blows.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.660
Colin, settle down.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.662
-You settle down.
-You settle down.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.998
[class bell rings]

03:25.998 --> 03:28.583
-Hey, everyone,
no homework tonight!
-Yeah!

03:28.583 --> 03:32.963
That is not true, know
the difference between
carbon 12, 13 and 14.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.633
Jose, there's homework.
Colin if you could
wait a moment.

03:36.633 --> 03:41.304
Colin, I cannot have you
disturbing my class anymore.

03:41.304 --> 03:47.644
because if you do,
there will be consequences.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.815
Big ones.

03:51.815 --> 03:55.610
-Okay, come on.
-Just making sure that you
get that, thank you.

03:55.610 --> 04:01.075
You can leave now,
you may both leave.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.913
[Trudy on PA] Finally a warm
welcome back to Mr. Dwyer,

04:05.913 --> 04:08.832
who has just returned from
building homes in Honduras.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.292
All right, all right,
all right.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.795
Okay, he can't hear you.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.591
Hope I get the same response
when I come back from Cancun
on my spring break!

04:17.591 --> 04:21.386
You guys are really that excited
that Mr. Dwyer is back?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.888
Mr. D's the best!

04:22.888 --> 04:25.724
Okay, you realize
that I am also Mr. D,

04:25.724 --> 04:28.560
and I have been all
of my teaching career as well?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.145
But, this is your
first year teaching.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.897
No, I substituted
for years.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.565
Substituting
is not a teaching job.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.442
Oh, is that right?
For your information,

04:35.442 --> 04:38.570
substitute teachers
are the teachers that
cover for teachers

04:38.570 --> 04:41.156
that like to go on little
"trips" to Honduras in the
middle of the school year.

04:41.156 --> 04:44.952
Well Mr. D's still
everyone's favorite teacher.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.037
I could curse
at you right now Jonathan.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.872
But you can't.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.000
But I can when I
get to the staff room.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.838
You're a beep!

04:56.838 --> 04:59.049
You don't
even know what I said.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.344
Gerry Duncan? Paul Dwyer.
Welcome to Xavier.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.889
-How we treating you so far?
-Good, yeah, you're the
other Mr. D.

05:05.889 --> 05:09.434
Steve, how you doing?
Hey Bobbi, you good? I am back!

05:09.434 --> 05:11.311
They're comparing us a
lot to each other.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.855
Two Mr. D's. we're
getting compared a lot.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.398
It's confusing at times

05:15.398 --> 05:17.109
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
your braces are off!

05:17.109 --> 05:19.569
Yeah, you're teeth look
good. I noticed that.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.989
No, I mean his braces
in his legs, he had
a hard time walking.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.865
His parents had a tough
time with him.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.119
-Anyway, look I gotta get going.
-Well, just so you know...

05:27.119 --> 05:29.329
-Good to see I'm back, I'm back.
-...there are two Mr. D's.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.831
Number two, number one.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.673
Fifteen minutes? Excuse me,
is that you, 15 minutes on the
microwave?

05:39.673 --> 05:42.134
[sighs] Yes, I am
making my lunch.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.094
-Your lunch? What is it?
-Shark.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.470
-Shark?
-Yeah.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.306
-You're having shark?
-Yeah, it's frozen.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.641
Frozen, shark. Isn't that
on the endangered species list?

05:49.641 --> 05:53.061
-It's getting there.
-It's getting there, wow.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.480
All right, well,
you're the librarian, right?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.440
-Yes.
-Are you even supposed
to be in the staff room?

05:57.440 --> 06:01.236
-Excuse me?
-Well, you're not a
teacher, this is for teachers.

06:01.236 --> 06:05.282
I have a Bachelor of
Education, just like you do.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.618
Okay, listen Captain
Quint,

06:08.618 --> 06:13.790
the microwave
is not for cooking shark, okay?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.168
Wow, did you catch it yourself?

06:22.341 --> 06:24.509
Hey, guys...you're ties
are a little, uh, loose.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.262
-Do you want to fix those?
-Excuse me gentlemen, fix
your ties please.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.972
Relax, I'll fix it in class.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.266
Excuse me? You know what?

06:31.266 --> 06:33.310
You're the student,
I'm the teacher,

06:33.310 --> 06:35.103
I could ruin you like that!

06:35.103 --> 06:38.648
Now, fix your tie
and fix them now!

06:38.648 --> 06:41.318
-And don't let me ask you again.
-Sorry, miss, won't
happen again.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.777
Go!

06:46.073 --> 06:49.034
Hey, are librarians
allowed to use the microwave
in the staff room?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.702
-Just a second.
-What are you doing?

06:50.702 --> 06:53.663
-I'm on gradetheteacher.com
-What's that?

06:53.663 --> 06:58.668
Oh, it's this website
where students can grade their
teachers and leave comments.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.505
I'm on it almost every,
I'm on it everyday.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.968
-Am I on it?
-Um, nope, nothing.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.098
-Not one comment?
-Ah, I got a new one!

07:11.098 --> 07:16.603
I love this thing. "Ms. Mason
has the worst laugh ever".

07:16.603 --> 07:18.479
I don't have a bad laugh, do I?

07:18.479 --> 07:21.691
Um... it's different,
it's unique, it's yours.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.027
I wish I could find out
who posts this stuff.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.695
Hit refresh, see if I
have a comment.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.948
-You don't have a comment.
-You didn't hit refresh.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.451
Still nothing.
See if Dwyer has anything.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.163
Whoa! A-plus. all good comments.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.582
"Mr. D's the best listener."
"Mr D's so chill."

07:37.582 --> 07:39.126
"His impressions of the staff
are hilarious."

07:39.126 --> 07:41.420
"He has changed
my life forever."

07:41.420 --> 07:45.673
It's just a stupid website
Come on, it's lunchtime.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.719
I wonder if the kids are
posting my comments on his

07:49.719 --> 07:51.512
-because we're both Mr. D.
-Yeah.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.722
And that's why I don't have any?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.474
-That could be it.
-Yeah.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.436
-That could totally be it.
-That would explain it.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.105
All right, come on,
let's go.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.456
Twenty minutes now.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.043
Let me just put this in for...

08:24.504 --> 08:26.965
What's in there today? Koala?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.178

08:41.980 --> 08:44.274

08:47.735 --> 08:51.448
-Hey, Mrs. Hunt.
-Ha-ha-ha-ha...

08:51.448 --> 08:55.869
Hilarious joke, Colin.
Calling a man a woman. Funny.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.330
That's swish,
three-point basketball.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.208
But where's your
hilarious friends
right now Colin?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.335
I don't see them around
right now.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.795
Here they come.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.590
Gentlemen, welcome back.

09:09.590 --> 09:13.136
Colin and I were just
chatting about sports.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.014
Got some chips huh?
Fun, that's cool.

09:16.014 --> 09:20.560
Got dill pickle pals huh?
Salt and Vinegar chums.
Chip Chaps.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.355
-What is wrong with you?
-Nothing, thank you
for asking though.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.400
I'll see you
in class Colin. Chips.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.363
Give me some chips.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.453
Sir, this isn't fair.
We didn't even know
about this quiz

09:38.453 --> 09:39.954
Yes, you did.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.084
Okay, stop writing.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.211
I thought we
had 20 more minutes.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.256
Nope, Maya's right.
Not fair.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
I assumed you all knew.
Maybe you didn't.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.511
So my mistake. No quiz.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.346
Instead we are going to talk.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.557
You don't even know me.
I'd like you to get to know me.

09:58.557 --> 10:01.851
The real me. Ask questions
anything you want.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.562
When was the first time
you got drunk?

10:03.562 --> 10:07.857
Okay, grade 11.
Greg and Mike, St. Joe's dance.

10:07.857 --> 10:12.195
Mike got drunk, he hit on a nun.
True story.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.406
-Which teachers are dating?
-Can't tell you yet Maya,

10:14.406 --> 10:16.616
but when you graduate,
I will tell you, how's that?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.536
-See that's real.
-Have you ever smoked drugs?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.455
Yes, I've smoked pot.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.958
I'm not gonna lie, all right?
I want to tell you the truth.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.919
Marijuana, Cancun,
with my friend Greg.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.255
Thought I had to go to the
hospital. A little freaked out.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.633
But I do not condone drugs.
nor do I do drugs anymore.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.470
It's rare to have some teacher
be this honest,

10:36.470 --> 10:41.516
and yes I'm strict,
and yes I'm teacher, teacher,
teacher, lecture, strict.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.852
But I'm also real.A
You'll also get to know me,
you'll realize,

10:44.852 --> 10:47.397
hey... this guys pretty good.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.149
When did you
lose your virginity?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.109
-[laughter]
-You see? Now, that's not funny.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.361
That's inappropriate.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.615
-You said we could ask anything.
-Yeah, but not that.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.741
Okay, how would you feel
if I asked you when did
you lose your virginity?

10:58.741 --> 11:01.244
Or have you lost...
Awkward isn't it?

11:01.244 --> 11:04.789
It's this awkward
conversation right now
about our virginity...

11:04.789 --> 11:07.626
and stand up if
you've slept with Ben.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.670
No! Oh, my God.
I was kidding. Sit.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.380
[laughter]

11:12.380 --> 11:16.050
Quiz is back on, thanks to Ben.
Back to work.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.012
[boy] Way to go, Benjamin.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.890
Hey. Hey, you. Hey, you.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.226
You think you're
a comedian, huh?

11:25.226 --> 11:29.230
Ha! Ha! You think you're
a comedian?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.689
You're a Mrs.

11:30.689 --> 11:34.902
You're a Mrs. You're a Mrs.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.615
No... that's not it.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.908
You're a Mrs.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.995
Oh, what's that?
Do I sound like I'm laughing?

11:43.995 --> 11:47.748
No, I sound like
punching you in the face!

11:47.748 --> 11:50.918
Yeah, cause that's all
you're going to hear

11:50.918 --> 11:55.256
if you don't start behaving
in my classroom.

11:55.256 --> 11:59.553
Wow! That's better.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.555
Don't be late with that.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.475
Well, well, well,
look who needs the library.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.019
Hope you don't hog all the
books, Mr. Duncan.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.022
-I just need the Internet.
-Well, did you
reserve a computer?

12:11.022 --> 12:12.773
No, Mr. Leung, I did not.

12:12.773 --> 12:17.696
-It's Lee-yung Lee-yung
-Lee-yung. Okay Mr. Leung.

12:17.696 --> 12:22.075
-I just need it for five
-minutes. I will give you
five minutes.

12:22.075 --> 12:26.037
-Who's that?
-That's my parents.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.456
-Your parents?
-I was adopted.

12:28.456 --> 12:33.420
-So they came here...
-No, they were here
and I came.

12:33.420 --> 12:37.215
-I need it for five minutes
-Well, I will give it to
you for five minutes.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.342
-I'm not asking for five.
-Well, I'm already
giving it to you.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.387
I'm telling you.
Hey, kiddo.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.472
Hey, sir.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.267
-What's wrong?
-I just got cut from
the basketball team.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.394
Oh...

12:49.394 --> 12:52.105
You know Michael Jordan got cut
from his high school team?

12:52.105 --> 12:55.149
-Really, sir?
-Yeah, greatest player
in the world.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.277
Cut in high school.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.153
He didn't let one coach,
and one teacher

12:59.153 --> 13:02.574
tell him he didn't have the
ability look how he turned out.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.659
Maybe one day I can be the
best player in the world.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.119
Hmm.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.079
Well, first you gotta
make the team next year,

13:08.079 --> 13:10.039
then you gotta star on it,
then you gotta go to college,
star there,

13:10.039 --> 13:14.294
NBA, six championships.
But I like your thinking.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.212
-Yeah.
-I met Michael Jordan once.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.797
-Really?
-Yeah, he was coming
out of a game,

13:18.797 --> 13:21.301
and I stuck my hand
over the, where they come out,

13:21.301 --> 13:23.886
and I, he did that. Michael!

13:23.886 --> 13:27.098
Sir, that's so cool.
That's cool, I touched him.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.684
So...

13:30.602 --> 13:32.270
-Mod Squad.
-What?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.272
-Nah, just...
-[class bell ringing]

13:34.272 --> 13:37.024
Anyway, go on with your
day. Don't worry about it.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.735
-Thanks, sir.
-You're welcome.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.819
Grade the teacher.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.407
Nothing.
How is that possible?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.618
Time's up.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.746
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.667
Hey, Simon, Simon, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.753
-Did you have a chance
to talk to Colin yet?
-Right, I'm working up to it.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.963
No, you can't work up to it.
You just gotta go for it.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.549
-Well...
-No, It's like a Band-aid,
you just gotta rip it off.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.135
Oh, no, I'm more of a
warm water sort of guy.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.970
No, no, no, just rip it off.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.930
-Like a bath...okay
-Rip it off, you know.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.809
-Yeah.
-Okay, how's this?

14:14.312 --> 14:17.691
You do not mess with me
because I am a lion,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.442
and you do not mess
with a lion,

14:19.442 --> 14:22.278
'cause I will break
out of my cage

14:22.278 --> 14:25.615
using the claws
that made me king of the jungle

14:25.615 --> 14:28.993
and I will rip you open I will
tear your face off

14:28.993 --> 14:32.246
and I will wear that face
to Halloween parties.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.793
Like a Halloween mask, and
there's nothing you can
do about it.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.714
-Nothing!
-Hunt is scary crazy.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.387
-How was that? Was that good?
-You come across
like a murderer.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.681
-Murderer?
-Is that what
you were going for?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.850
-I was going for lion.
-Then it's too much.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.853
-Was it a bit much?
-Yeah, a lot much.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.688
That's not good.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.734
Okay, who's this?
Who does this?

15:00.734 --> 15:02.652
[laughter]

15:05.279 --> 15:07.448
Mr. Duncan, how you doing?
We're just doing
some impressions.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.660
Yeah, I've heard about
this, so let's...
Don't let me stop you.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.246
-Do Ms. Calka!
-[Gerry] Yeah, let's see that.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.790
Ms. Calka? Ms. Calka's um...
Okay, okay.

15:15.790 --> 15:19.001
-[blowing]
-[laughter]

15:22.171 --> 15:24.465
-That's it?
-Yeah.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.886
That's not an impression,
that's just somebody
blowing a whistle.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.596
That could be
anyone that has a whistle.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.598
Yeah, but they know
what I'm doing.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.683
Okay, how about this one?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.645
-[laughter]
-Mr. Cheeley!

15:37.645 --> 15:41.441
-Ha! You got it! You got it!
-Lucy, that's just any...

15:41.441 --> 15:43.443
That's just someone looking
at their watch. How...?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.819
Are you guys serious?
That's, that's...

15:44.819 --> 15:47.530
Come on, do an
impression, somebody.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.908
Okay, uh, who do
you want me to do?

15:49.908 --> 15:51.618
-Do Mr. D.
-This Mr. D?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.120
-Me?
-Okay, um...

15:54.120 --> 15:58.374
Hey! look at me smiling.
Wink, wink, wink, wink.

15:58.374 --> 16:03.421
Wassup? Wassup? Wassup?
Hey, what's that?
You're homeless?

16:03.421 --> 16:05.590
Well, stay with me and my wife

16:05.590 --> 16:08.217
and then I'll build you
a home in, in, Honduras.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.219
Uh, everybody
loves me, I'm so nice.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.971
Uh... Oh, you're pregnant?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.223
Oh, no, that's okay, my wife
and I'll raise the baby for ya

16:14.223 --> 16:16.810
and then we'll give
it back to you and
lots of money.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.103
This is my impression
of Mr. Dwyer

16:19.103 --> 16:20.939
doing an impression
of Mr. Callaghan, ready?

16:20.939 --> 16:22.899
Teach hard! Ha-ha,
you're supposed to laugh, right?

16:22.899 --> 16:25.819
Here's an impression
of Mr. Dwyer if he was
hammering a nail.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.987
Oh, my God, that's so original.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.740
How did you think of that?
Oh, no, that's amazing.

16:30.740 --> 16:34.118
That is unbelievable,
I've never seen that. Wow!

16:39.582 --> 16:43.210
-Who else?
-Kids, I think it's time
to go back to class.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.213
Just messing.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.466
Embarrassing.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.939
Hey, Paul. Can I speak
to you for a quick sec?

17:02.939 --> 17:06.776
Yeah. Keep reading class.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.237
Listen, uh, I don't think
we got off on the right foot

17:10.237 --> 17:14.701
and I just wanted to come and
say I'm sorry for, you know,

17:14.701 --> 17:16.995
-maybe the way I've been acting.
-It's okay, it's cool.

17:16.995 --> 17:21.666
It's just, you're so nice
to the kids

17:21.666 --> 17:24.377
and everything you do makes me
look like the bad Mr. D.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.838
Let's not talk about this
right now. I got my class.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.674
-But thanks for coming.
-Actually, uh ,listen,

17:29.674 --> 17:32.844
I also want to apologize
for the impression I did of you.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.721
It wasn't, it wasn't cool.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.264
[chuckling] I accept your
apology, as a matter of fact,

17:37.264 --> 17:40.018
I apologize too, for not making
you feel too welcome.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.604
Maybe we stop doing
impressions altogether,
how's that?

17:43.604 --> 17:47.984
No, no I want you to do
an impression of me right now
for the kids.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.611
-What?
-It's only fair.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.613
Kids, excuse me.

17:52.613 --> 17:57.284
How many of you would like
to see Mr. D do an impression
of Mr. D?

17:57.284 --> 17:59.453
[all] Yeah!

17:59.453 --> 18:02.164
-Look, you guys got work to do.
-Come on, Mr. D.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.751
-We love your impressions.
-Let's go, let's see it.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.838
They love 'em. Here we
go, this is me right here.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.342
Okay, all right,
that's fair. That's fair.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.637
I stand with my
hands on my hips, okay.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.098
I got another one.
How about this one?

18:19.098 --> 18:23.477
-All right.
-That's awesome, sir.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.772
Not really awesome, uh...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.274
Oh, you didn't get this one.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.777
You missed one. I do that a lot.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.946
You didn't do that one.
You didn't get it.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.363
No, I didn't actually.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.825
Do this sometimes, okay?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.201
-You didn't get that.
-That was fun though
class right?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.037
Give it up for Mr. Duncan.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.997
[applause]

18:42.997 --> 18:45.917
-You missed a couple.
-You guys got reading to do.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.835
Okay, this I leave
a class sometimes.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.880
-Okay.
-Okay? Sometimes I do the
moonwalk out for the kids.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.215
-Okay.
-So you don't know that one.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.718
So... not perfect, not great.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.472
Hey, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.810
I was just up on the roof
thinking some thoughts,
clearing my head.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.895
Maybe he should go back
and stay there for awhile.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.691
Okay, where's my marker?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.111
Anyway let's pick up
where we were last lesson.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.823
Who can tell me
what a valence electron is?

19:16.823 --> 19:20.785
-I've got one in my pants.
-Colin, shut up!
He'll go psycho.

19:20.785 --> 19:26.749
It's okay Violet,
I'm not gonna go psycho... yet.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.293
Fftt! Fftt!

19:29.293 --> 19:33.089
[chuckling]
I'm just kidding.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.715
Shank ya.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.468
Hey, ladies, Colin says he has

19:37.468 --> 19:39.386
a valence electron in his pants.

19:39.386 --> 19:43.057
That wouldn't be visible
with even the most
powerful microscope.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.935
[laughter]

19:45.935 --> 19:49.063
[chuckling]

19:49.063 --> 19:53.317
Check and see if this
Mr. D has any comments now.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.486
Oh yeah? What makes
you think that you do?

19:55.486 --> 19:58.405
Spoke to the kids,
let them get to know me.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.534
There's a new Mr. D in town.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.122
Where's the microwave?

20:07.915 --> 20:12.252
It's not here. Weird.

20:14.881 --> 20:19.426
Hey, there's a bunch here.
Um, "Mr. Duncan likes
the wacky tobacky."

20:19.426 --> 20:22.638
-What?
-"Mr. Duncan is mean to Mr. D."

20:22.638 --> 20:26.726
-No, I'm not...
-"Mr. Duncan lost his
virginity to a nun

20:26.726 --> 20:28.686
when he was drunk in grade 11?"

20:28.686 --> 20:31.856
Oh, my God! Is that true?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.816
What do you think?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.818
It's not true,
these kids didn't listen.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.654
They screwed up my story.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.280
Mike was with the nun.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.075
Wait, wait, wait there's a
there's a nice one here

20:42.075 --> 20:44.869
way down three pages there's...

20:44.869 --> 20:48.748
"Mr. Duncan seems nice and
he knows Michael Jordan."

20:48.748 --> 20:52.334
-You know Michael Jordan?
-Maybe, we met.

20:52.334 --> 20:56.964
So the kid got
the story wrong? [laughing]

20:58.465 --> 21:00.218
So, this is
the new laugh?

21:01.343 --> 21:03.596
An that's what
you came up with?

21:17.317 --> 21:18.652
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.362
-Almost done.
-Oh, sure.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.907
-You didn't tell
anyone did ya?
-No sshhh, secret.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.075
Nice.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.452
Hey, you know Colin Stratton?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.746
Well, he's always
giving me lip in class.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.124
Today I embarrassed him
in front of everyone.

21:31.124 --> 21:35.502
-Shut him right up.
-So now he's mad at you?

21:35.502 --> 21:38.131
Yeah, but there's
nothing he can do about it.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.882
OK, well just be careful,

21:39.882 --> 21:43.052
because the last school he
was at, he stabbed a teacher.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.680
He stabbed a... what?

21:49.558 --> 21:52.770
♪ Awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome ♪
