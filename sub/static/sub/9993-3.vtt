00:24.118 --> 00:25.000
Hi, again.

00:27.459 --> 00:30.663
Uh, I've been waiting to see the director for 40 minutes now.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.319
Do you have any idea how much longer he's going to be?

00:33.320 --> 00:36.465
I'm sorry, all I can say is he does know you're here.

00:37.861 --> 00:40.509
Well, I believe District Attorney Devalos spoke with him.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.041
He arranged for me to see one of your patients at 9:30.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.433
Ma'am, I understand exactly what you want.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.575
I understand exactly why you're here.

00:47.910 --> 00:50.788
But you're just going to have to take a seat until the doctor comes down.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.493
Well, maybe you could just page him.

00:52.492 --> 00:54.691
You know, I have already called twice.

00:55.010 --> 00:58.154
Now, there's really nothing else to do but take a seat.

01:01.113 --> 01:02.279
Look, you know what?

01:02.458 --> 01:04.157
He's obviously pretty busy today.

01:04.158 --> 01:05.606
You all seem pretty busy today.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.210
So I think what I'm gonna have to do for now is,

01:08.211 --> 01:12.626
I'm just gonna leave,
and I'll call back tomorrow and try to reschedule, okay?

01:20.096 --> 01:23.080
I'm sorry, um, I think I need you to buzz me out.

01:23.132 --> 01:25.673
I think you really need to take a seat.

01:26.902 --> 01:28.077
Excuse me?

01:28.356 --> 01:31.028
Come on, now, Beverly,
just take a seat.

01:31.371 --> 01:33.772
You know, let's not go through this all over again.

01:33.773 --> 01:34.957
I'm sorry,
go through what again?

01:34.958 --> 01:36.867
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:36.868 --> 01:39.863
My name isn't Beverly.
Could you just open the door?

01:45.214 --> 01:48.993
Okay, obviously we've had a huge misunderstanding here.

01:49.257 --> 01:51.078
You know the Day Room rules, Beverly.

01:51.079 --> 01:52.943
You've been asked to take a seat--

01:52.944 --> 01:53.895
take a seat.

01:54.039 --> 01:55.619
I am happy to take a seat,

01:55.664 --> 02:00.180
but perhaps you could just call the director and let him know that Allison Dubois--

02:00.181 --> 02:00.955
not Beverly--

02:01.971 --> 02:03.386
is here to see him.

02:03.570 --> 02:05.199
We're happy to make that call, Beverly,

02:05.200 --> 02:06.334
if you'll just come with us.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.495
What? What?

02:07.546 --> 02:09.526
Hey! Get off me!

02:09.578 --> 02:11.053
- Beverly.
- How dare you!

02:11.070 --> 02:12.707
- This is a mistake!|- Calm down.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.256
Beverly. Don't... Beverly.

02:14.307 --> 02:16.951
I'm Allison Dubois! I'm here to see the director!

02:16.952 --> 02:18.842
- Beverly, calm down.
- Let me go

02:19.022 --> 02:21.246
Please don't do this!

02:21.404 --> 02:22.122
Please!

02:22.731 --> 02:23.851
I'm not a patient!

02:24.169 --> 02:25.155
Please don't...

02:25.277 --> 02:26.532
Please don't do this.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.029
Please! Please!

02:28.080 --> 02:29.186
I'm not a patient!

02:29.187 --> 02:29.956
Please...

02:32.342 --> 02:34.567
Now, try to relax now, Beverly.

02:34.833 --> 02:37.257
This will only hurt for a moment.

02:46.839 --> 02:48.049
Thank God you're up.

02:49.147 --> 02:51.347
Um, you know if we have any more aspirin?

02:51.348 --> 02:54.062
What? Aspirin?

02:54.435 --> 02:55.855
Um...

02:56.788 --> 03:00.235
I-I... think there's some in the kids' bathroom,

03:00.286 --> 03:01.121
some chewables.

03:01.970 --> 03:02.958
Why?

03:03.734 --> 03:04.989
My head's killing me.

03:06.821 --> 03:08.076
Oh, tell me about it.

03:55.137 --> 03:56.858
Mom!

03:59.765 --> 04:01.345
I think we're out of milk.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.357
I just bought some last night -- look again.

04:03.358 --> 04:04.290
Here.

04:05.902 --> 04:08.482
10:00 should be fine for the McMillan meeting.

04:08.532 --> 04:11.112
Yeah. Just make sure that Mike and Steve know.

04:11.341 --> 04:13.354
All right, what'll it be, yogurt or cereal?

04:13.355 --> 04:14.835
Yogurt with cereal on top.

04:15.811 --> 04:17.240
And you, milady?

04:17.716 --> 04:18.695
Breath mints.

04:19.063 --> 04:21.463
Well, that is not an option, so try again.

04:22.337 --> 04:24.121
- Oh, yogurt.
- Okay.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.270
Let's go shopping.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.137
- Aren't you a little old for dolls?
- Ariel.

04:29.138 --> 04:32.609
The box said, "For ages five and up."

04:32.702 --> 04:33.456
So?

04:33.507 --> 04:36.327
So, I'm ages five and up.

04:36.557 --> 04:38.849
- You don't act like it.
- Ariel.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.828
All right, I'll see you soon.

04:41.937 --> 04:43.091
I like to color.

04:44.146 --> 04:45.028
Okay.

04:47.886 --> 04:49.599
How's your headache?
Any better?

04:49.600 --> 04:52.580
Much. I may never take grown-up aspirin again.

04:53.792 --> 04:57.285
Mommy... Bridgette's taking breath mints out of your purse.

04:57.671 --> 05:00.066
Aren't you a little old to tattletale?

05:00.168 --> 05:01.065
Bridgette.

05:01.647 --> 05:03.357
You, finish your yogurt;

05:03.408 --> 05:06.788
you,  stop taking things out of my purse without asking. Got it?

05:06.789 --> 05:07.745
Got it.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.672
All right, put those mints down.

05:10.051 --> 05:10.858
Finish your yogurt.

05:10.859 --> 05:13.894
The Mommy Express is leaving for school in ten minutes.

05:26.425 --> 05:27.384
I.D. badge?

05:29.405 --> 05:30.299
Bridgette.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.093
It seems...

05:34.531 --> 05:36.778
my seven-year-old's made off with it.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.173
But I do have my driver's license, though.

05:39.174 --> 05:42.127
I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't let you through without your badge.

05:42.128 --> 05:43.131
Come on, you know me.

05:43.132 --> 05:44.594
I'm here almost every morning.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.715
I understand, ma'am, but without your badge, I can't let you through.

05:47.716 --> 05:49.146
Why don't you just give your office a call,

05:49.147 --> 05:53.147
have them phone down to Security and put your name on the visitors list?

05:54.539 --> 05:55.319
Oh, Bridgette,

05:55.324 --> 05:56.923
not my cell phone.

05:57.118 --> 05:59.378
Okay, is there a pay phone or something?

06:05.724 --> 06:07.624
I'm sorry, I'm expecting a call.

06:07.946 --> 06:11.856
Okay, well... I just have to call upstairs.
It'll just take a second.

06:13.296 --> 06:14.167
Hello?

06:14.860 --> 06:16.266
No, no, no.
Don't-don't hang up.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.150
Just... just talk to me.

06:18.805 --> 06:20.060
Do you have the baby?

06:21.945 --> 06:23.284
Of course. I'll meet you anywhere you like.

06:23.285 --> 06:25.966
Just-just promise me that you won't hurt her.

06:29.415 --> 06:33.243
Hi. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a bother, but I'm late for an important meeting.

06:33.244 --> 06:35.456
Is there any way you could use your security phone

06:35.457 --> 06:37.491
to call the District Attorney's Office and get me cleared?

06:37.492 --> 06:39.107
I would really appreciate it.

06:42.681 --> 06:45.346
- What's your name?
- Allison Dubois. Thank you.

06:49.181 --> 06:49.817
M a'am?

06:50.594 --> 06:52.943
I'm afraid they don't know you up there.

06:52.944 --> 06:53.544
What?

06:53.762 --> 06:55.122
The District Attorney's Office.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.754
They said there's no one by the name of Allison Dubois on their staff.

06:57.755 --> 06:59.353
Well, that's not possible.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.518
- Who did you talk to?
- Ma'am...

07:01.519 --> 07:03.324
I'm sorry, could you just try again?

07:03.325 --> 07:05.694
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I was violating procedure calling the first time.

07:05.695 --> 07:07.993
No, I know, but maybe if you let me talk to them...

07:07.994 --> 07:10.396
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're just gonna have to go home and get your badge.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.730
This is ridiculous.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.190
Please don't raise your voice, ma'am.

07:13.191 --> 07:15.200
I'm not raising my voice!

07:15.503 --> 07:17.319
I am trying to get into my office.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.713
Do you have a problem here?

07:18.714 --> 07:19.554
Well, kind of.

07:19.701 --> 07:22.720
She claims she works in the District Attorney's Office and forgot her badge.

07:22.721 --> 07:25.550
But when I called upstairs, they claimed they didn't know her.

07:25.551 --> 07:26.725
It's just a misunderstanding.

07:26.726 --> 07:28.721
Do you have an I.D. badge, ma'am?

07:28.978 --> 07:31.502
Yes. But apparently, I left it at home.

07:31.553 --> 07:35.703
Well, I think the only thing to do, then, is to go back home and get it.

07:42.022 --> 07:42.851
You're right.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.294
I'll just drive home and get it.

07:45.563 --> 07:46.679
Appreciate it, miss.

07:47.221 --> 07:50.356
And would you mind if we escorted you back to your car?

07:52.227 --> 07:54.067
You know, this really isn't necessary.

07:54.068 --> 07:55.924
I think I can find my own car.

07:59.885 --> 08:01.402
My car is gone!

08:02.384 --> 08:05.014
Now, are you sure this is where you parked it?

08:06.422 --> 08:07.542
Yes! Yeah!

08:07.593 --> 08:08.627
Yes, I'm sure!

08:08.678 --> 08:10.165
This is my spot.

08:10.678 --> 08:12.819
I park right here every day.

08:13.852 --> 08:15.524
Right next to this red truck.

08:18.660 --> 08:20.695
Why are you looking at me that way?

08:21.288 --> 08:23.038
My-my car has been stolen.

08:23.089 --> 08:25.618
Yes, ma'am.
So how do you want to do this?

08:25.619 --> 08:27.577
You want to fill a report out now,

08:27.578 --> 08:29.936
standing here in the middle of the parking lot?

08:29.937 --> 08:34.164
Or would you like us to run you home, 
so you can get your badge and whatever else you need,

08:34.166 --> 08:36.629
and fill it out in your office when you get back?

08:36.630 --> 08:37.609
Yes.

08:38.453 --> 08:41.129
Yes, please, if you could run me home and back.

08:45.127 --> 08:46.156
Thank you.

08:55.391 --> 08:56.189
Problem?

08:57.930 --> 08:59.460
My key isn't working.

08:59.919 --> 09:01.494
Are you sure you live here?

09:01.968 --> 09:04.129
What kind of question is that?
Of course I live here.

09:04.130 --> 09:05.935
I've lived here for nine years.

09:08.953 --> 09:12.141
- Can I help you?|- I don't know.

09:12.331 --> 09:15.421
- Can I help you? What are you doing in my house?

09:16.897 --> 09:17.823
Officers...

09:17.900 --> 09:19.410
Don't talk to them, talk to me!

09:19.411 --> 09:21.216
What are you doing in my house?

09:21.589 --> 09:22.749
Sorry to bother you.

09:22.876 --> 09:24.043
Do you know this woman?

09:24.044 --> 09:25.814
Does this woman live here, ma'am?

09:25.815 --> 09:28.910
No. I'm sorry, I've never seen her before in my life.

09:29.245 --> 09:30.519
She's lying!

09:30.821 --> 09:32.054
This is preposterous!

09:32.105 --> 09:33.040
This is my house!

09:33.041 --> 09:35.979
Go ask my neighbors, go inside, go look at my things.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.560
Sorry to have bothered you, ma'am.

09:37.561 --> 09:38.294
Our mistake.

09:43.260 --> 09:44.490
This is my house!

09:44.735 --> 09:46.208
My children live in this house!

09:46.209 --> 09:47.952
My husband lives in this house!

09:47.953 --> 09:49.458
This is my house!

09:50.325 --> 09:51.797
You have to believe me!

09:52.195 --> 09:53.405
You have to help me!

09:53.634 --> 09:57.203
We do believe you, and we do want to help you.

09:57.587 --> 09:58.663
Stop it!

09:58.878 --> 10:00.979
Stop it! Stop it, please!

10:01.250 --> 10:02.045
Listen  to me!

10:02.557 --> 10:04.509
You're making a terrible mistake!

10:08.624 --> 10:09.876
Welcome back, Beverly.

10:14.761 --> 10:15.966
That'll be all, gentlemen.

10:15.967 --> 10:16.577
Thank you.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.631
Try to relax now, Beverly.

10:24.865 --> 10:26.715
Why do you keep calling me that?

10:27.136 --> 10:28.197
'Cause it's your name.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.332
No.  My name is Allison.

10:30.939 --> 10:32.254
Allison Dubois.

10:37.171 --> 10:38.442
Please...

10:39.782 --> 10:41.665
I need to call my husband.

10:43.017 --> 10:43.992
You mean Joe?

10:45.215 --> 10:46.470
How do you know that?

10:46.471 --> 10:49.056
We've been at this for how long now, Beverly?

10:50.726 --> 10:51.723
Eight months?

10:52.687 --> 10:53.434
Nine?

10:53.697 --> 10:55.962
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:57.055 --> 10:58.765
I have never been here before.

10:59.521 --> 11:04.296
You know, I understand the allure of "Allison Dubois." I do.

11:06.255 --> 11:08.335
I understand why you want to be her.

11:10.187 --> 11:15.092
She has a loving husband, three beautiful children, an exciting career.

11:16.295 --> 11:22.043
But we have to confront the fact that Allison Dubois isn't real,

11:22.898 --> 11:26.533
and that the deeper you lose yourself in the fantasy of her life,

11:27.202 --> 11:30.792
the less likely you are to ever find any sort of true happiness.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.160
Now, what year is it?

11:35.976 --> 11:36.965
Excuse me?

11:37.131 --> 11:37.829
The year.

11:38.551 --> 11:41.461
Beverly, I'd like you to tell me what the year is.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.428
2005?

11:57.277 --> 11:59.987
This is the 12th of June, 1959.

12:01.098 --> 12:02.665
I don't understand.

12:04.223 --> 12:11.749
The only thing you need to understand is there's a very real world out there and it's just waiting for you.

12:13.809 --> 12:15.424
The sooner you accept that...

12:16.759 --> 12:21.528
the sooner you let go of Allison, the sooner you're going to get better.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.248
Oh.

12:40.047 --> 12:41.257
Thank God you're up.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.365
Um, you know if we have any more aspirin?

12:56.069 --> 12:57.901
Mom!

12:59.736 --> 13:01.316
I think we're out of milk.

13:01.841 --> 13:03.826
I got some last night.
Look again.

13:03.928 --> 13:04.768
Here.

13:05.706 --> 13:08.286
10:00 should be fine for the McMillan meeting.

13:08.397 --> 13:10.375
Just make sure that Mike and Steve know.

13:10.386 --> 13:11.549
Let's go shopping.

13:11.693 --> 13:13.204
Aren't you a little old for dolls?

13:13.205 --> 13:14.254
The box said,

13:14.305 --> 13:16.517
"For ages five and up."

13:16.743 --> 13:17.516
So?

13:17.719 --> 13:21.112
So... I'm ages five and up.

13:21.408 --> 13:22.529
You don't act like it.

13:22.530 --> 13:23.293
You okay?

13:23.673 --> 13:25.478
Look like you just saw a ghost.

13:25.559 --> 13:26.362
Wait, scratch that.

13:26.363 --> 13:30.188
You look like someone who isn't you would look if they saw a ghost.

13:30.209 --> 13:33.239
Everything that just happened here, I dreamt last night.

13:34.255 --> 13:36.919
You glimpsed a future in which you poured yogurt?

13:36.920 --> 13:39.225
My God, stop her before she dreams again.

13:39.623 --> 13:41.566
- I'm serious.
- Mommy.

13:42.384 --> 13:45.187
Bridgette's getting breath mints out of your purse.

13:45.188 --> 13:49.143
- Aren't you getting a little too old to be a tattletale?
- That, too?

13:51.591 --> 13:52.785
I am awake, right?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.138
Ow!

13:55.362 --> 13:56.285
You're awake.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.149
I'm dreaming.

14:06.974 --> 14:07.991
ID  badge?

14:09.471 --> 14:10.071
Oh.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.465
Can't... I can't seem to find it.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.352
But I'm sure if you call the District Attorney's office...

14:20.353 --> 14:21.333
Mrs. Dubois?

14:22.402 --> 14:23.191
It's all right.

14:23.192 --> 14:25.632
Just be sure and remember it tomorrow, okay?

14:28.829 --> 14:31.259
30 years, Arizona State Correctional Facility.

14:31.856 --> 14:32.956
It's a gift, Maggie.

14:32.957 --> 14:34.293
Aw, I'm touched.

14:34.828 --> 14:38.931
I hope you won't be hurt when I try and return it and get something better.

14:38.932 --> 14:40.841
Margaret, your client murdered his own parents.

14:40.842 --> 14:42.323
He did it with a skilsaw.

14:42.324 --> 14:45.848
Then he went out to dinner with some friends and used his father's credit card to pay the bill.

14:45.849 --> 14:46.921
There is nothing better.

14:46.922 --> 14:49.457
Now, you know, ordinarily I'd agree with you.

14:50.606 --> 14:55.205
But in this case, he wasn't in his right mind when he committed those terrible acts.

14:55.206 --> 14:57.024
He didn't know what he was doing.

14:57.025 --> 14:57.968
And under the law...

14:57.969 --> 14:58.838
Please.

14:59.012 --> 15:03.307
What about when he buried the bodies and scrubbed down the house with bleach to get rid of the evidence?

15:03.308 --> 15:04.873
Was he in his right mind then?

15:04.874 --> 15:06.027
Or his left?

15:07.741 --> 15:08.901
Isn't he delightful?

15:09.190 --> 15:12.622
He actually thinks the person who scoffs the most wins.

15:13.258 --> 15:15.434
Whether you like it or not, Manuel,

15:15.549 --> 15:20.737
Timothy Kercher has a severe dissociative identity disorder.

15:20.846 --> 15:26.979
In fact, one of the leading psychiatrists at the
University of Arizona is prepared to come to court

15:27.030 --> 15:34.440
and to testifiy that an alternate personnality was responsible
for both the crime and the attempt to cover it up.

15:34.491 --> 15:35.091
Really?

15:35.028 --> 15:36.971
- Both.
- An alternate personality?

15:37.531 --> 15:40.252
I wonder which one stood to inherit his parents' money.

15:40.253 --> 15:41.138
Come on, Manny.

15:41.164 --> 15:43.041
We both know how this is going to go.

15:43.042 --> 15:47.258
I'm going to trot out my expert who says that the kid is too crazy to stand trial.

15:47.259 --> 15:50.298
And you're going to trot out yours that says he's not.

15:50.299 --> 15:53.064
We're going to waste a lot of money and a lot of time

15:53.065 --> 15:56.270
and a judge is going to appoint somebody to break the tie.

15:56.271 --> 15:57.139
Exactly.

15:58.681 --> 16:02.411
Which is why I was hoping you might be more receptive to my offer.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.594
Here's what I'm prepared to do.

16:05.595 --> 16:07.811
Let my staff and me interview him one last time.

16:07.812 --> 16:10.717
If we think that he's not competent to stand trial,

16:11.182 --> 16:13.262
I'll stipulate as such to the court.

16:13.497 --> 16:14.662
What are you up to?

16:15.412 --> 16:17.582
Just trying to save us both some time.

16:18.212 --> 16:19.681
If we concur with your expert,

16:19.682 --> 16:23.484
then Kercher will be remanded to a psychiatric facility for treatment inside of a week.

16:23.485 --> 16:26.760
If not, you're no worse off than when you walked in here.

16:32.079 --> 16:34.979
Yeah, I'll, um, set up something for this afternoon.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.389
I like her.

16:44.633 --> 16:45.888
That makes two of us.

16:47.879 --> 16:49.454
How long has she been sick?

16:51.683 --> 16:52.753
Found out a few months ago.

16:52.754 --> 16:54.513
Apparently there's not much they can do.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.309
That's awful.

16:55.868 --> 17:00.608
Part of me actually hopes that I'm wrong about Kercher and we can wrap this up fast.

17:01.822 --> 17:04.398
Who knows, maybe there are alternative therapies out there.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.175
The sooner this is over, the sooner she can try and find some help.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.335
It was like coming out of a deep sleep.

17:12.210 --> 17:15.474
Only I couldn't have been sleeping, because I was standing.

17:15.751 --> 17:17.185
And I was breathing hard.

17:17.676 --> 17:20.452
Like I'd just run ten miles as fast as I could.

17:21.803 --> 17:23.647
But that made no sense because...

17:24.519 --> 17:27.194
I was standing in the middle of my living room.

17:28.688 --> 17:32.698
At first I thought I must be sick, and so I started to check my pulse.

17:33.687 --> 17:35.436
And that's when I noticed...

17:36.946 --> 17:39.396
the piece of scalp on the back of my hand.

17:41.846 --> 17:47.843
It must have been my mother's because the hair was definitely blonde.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.961
And when I touched it, it was still wet.

17:52.915 --> 17:53.913
Still warm.

17:54.724 --> 17:56.804
Like it hadn't been there very long.

17:58.898 --> 18:00.478
And that's when it hit me.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.052
He'd done it.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.680
He'd finally gone and done it.

18:08.396 --> 18:09.547
I'm sorry.

18:09.602 --> 18:11.387
Who did what, Mr. Kercher?

18:16.659 --> 18:17.399
Mr. Kercher?

18:23.644 --> 18:24.372
J ack.

18:25.722 --> 18:26.951
He hated my parents.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.013
He's always hated my parents.

18:29.202 --> 18:31.597
He'd been threatening to kill them forever.

18:32.086 --> 18:32.955
I see.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.234
So where is Jack now?

18:36.285 --> 18:37.452
Come on, now.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.428
I know you know.
I know they told you all about him.

18:42.570 --> 18:44.235
You know exactly where he is.

18:45.844 --> 18:46.585
Well, no.

18:46.958 --> 18:49.778
I'm sorry.
This is the first I've heard of him.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.570
He's here.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.133
He's inside me...

18:57.293 --> 18:58.245
listening.

18:59.752 --> 19:01.524
He can hear every word you say.

19:01.525 --> 19:02.125
Really?

19:03.238 --> 19:04.123
That's amazing.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.264
It is.

19:07.443 --> 19:08.928
So may I speak with Jack?

19:10.268 --> 19:10.964
No.

19:13.299 --> 19:14.294
I'm sorry.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.126
Jack's not speaking today.

19:17.346 --> 19:19.034
It hurts when Jack talks.

19:19.798 --> 19:22.328
- Really, this will just take a second.
- No.

19:23.359 --> 19:24.344
He won't do it.

19:25.726 --> 19:26.775
It hurts.

19:27.325 --> 19:29.279
Yes, it hurts--
I understand.

19:29.594 --> 19:32.532
He said it hurts, you fat, bald bastard!

19:33.662 --> 19:35.362
Come here!

19:35.820 --> 19:37.791
Come here! Come closer!

19:37.884 --> 19:39.167
I'll rip your nose off!

19:39.168 --> 19:40.740
I'll rip your ears off!

19:41.040 --> 19:41.986
Come here!

19:42.134 --> 19:43.208
Any one of you!

19:43.587 --> 19:44.409
Come on!

19:44.943 --> 19:46.011
Come on!

19:47.292 --> 19:48.608
Quite a performance, huh?

19:48.609 --> 19:51.061
I don't know...
he seemed pretty convincing to me.

19:51.062 --> 19:53.744
You're saying that because you sense something, because you saw something?

19:53.745 --> 19:54.630
No, not really.

19:54.708 --> 19:56.660
It's just...
he genuinely scared me.

19:56.661 --> 19:58.416
I did get some numbers, though.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.600
Couldn't tell you if they make him a liar or not.

20:00.601 --> 20:02.776
Just the same nine numbers over and over again.

20:02.777 --> 20:05.998
Seven-nine-six-zero-zero-two-eight-oh-five.

20:06.546 --> 20:07.466
Do you know what they could mean?

20:07.467 --> 20:10.367
Beats me.
Maybe it's Jack's social security number.

20:10.423 --> 20:11.338
Hang on.

20:11.718 --> 20:14.359
I got to get back to the office.
See you tomorrow.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.223
Yeah, go.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.056
Welcome back, Beverly.

20:30.826 --> 20:32.040
Our proud founder.

20:33.596 --> 20:34.324
Really?

20:35.196 --> 20:36.283
He started all this?

20:36.284 --> 20:38.831
Well, with a lot of help and some government funding.

20:38.832 --> 20:40.500
Oh, forgive me.
My name's Roger.

20:40.501 --> 20:41.361
I'm a graduate student.

20:41.362 --> 20:43.816
I'm doing my thesis on the history of this place.

20:43.817 --> 20:45.171
You know, I didn't mean to startle you,

20:45.172 --> 20:47.230
it's just nobody ever stops to look at these pictures.

20:47.231 --> 20:50.041
I thought maybe you escaped from one of the wards.

20:51.014 --> 20:52.214
Afraid not, Roger.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.338
I'm Allison.
I work with the District Attorney's office.

20:55.339 --> 20:56.366
And his name is?

20:56.417 --> 20:57.527
Dr. Elliot Peterson.

20:57.946 --> 20:59.746
Very highly regarded in his day.

20:59.848 --> 21:01.909
Of course, a lot of what he did, a lot of what he advocated,

21:01.910 --> 21:04.914
we consider barbaric now, but at the time...

21:06.627 --> 21:07.688
That's strange.

21:07.876 --> 21:09.182
This corridor looks brand new.

21:09.183 --> 21:09.968
That's because it is.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.355
You're standing in the new wing.
The old wing's in the rear.

21:12.356 --> 21:15.614
That's where Peterson used to play with the cutting edge therapies of the 1950s.

21:15.615 --> 21:18.368
Electroshock, insulin-shock, ice baths.

21:18.859 --> 21:22.438
Yes, it was a great time to be young, free and mentally ill.

21:23.093 --> 21:26.542
They were going to tear all this down back when they built the new wing back in 1997,

21:26.543 --> 21:28.056
but they ran out of funding.

21:28.057 --> 21:28.852
Lucky for me.

21:28.936 --> 21:31.791
It's a treasure trove of information for my thesis.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.551
Well, this is it.

21:35.044 --> 21:42.306
497 patient histories detailing 28 years worth of unintentional psychiatric cruelty.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.035
Pretty impressive, huh?

21:44.170 --> 21:45.368
Sure is.

21:49.511 --> 21:52.424
You ever run across a file on a patient named Beverly?

21:52.425 --> 21:54.410
Does this Beverly have a last name?

21:54.927 --> 21:55.589
Never mind.

21:57.650 --> 22:03.095
She would have been a patient of Dr. Peterson's around July, 1959.

22:08.433 --> 22:11.959
We have a Beverly Waller,
admitted November 3, 1958.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.709
I think we have some film on her if you're interested.

22:14.710 --> 22:18.155
Beverly Waller suffered a nervous collapse in the fall of 1958.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.074
Separated from her husband shortly thereafter,

22:22.016 --> 22:25.696
but he sued for custody of their eight-month-old daughter and won.

22:26.501 --> 22:28.071
Almost unheard of back then.

22:29.672 --> 22:32.256
Patient fell into a deep and unrecoverable depressive state,

22:32.257 --> 22:37.432
kidnapped her child and apparently threw herself and her infant daughter off the Mayawoch Bridge.

22:38.304 --> 22:39.324
Mom was rescued...

22:40.190 --> 22:41.658
Child apparently drowned.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.751
Beverly was committed here shortly thereafter.

22:45.311 --> 22:46.103
Thank you.

22:47.974 --> 22:50.649
All right, you got to say "roll 'em." Roll 'em.

22:54.670 --> 22:58.663
Please, you have to let me out of here.

23:00.555 --> 23:02.850
I have to pick up my children.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.464
You know you don't have any children, Beverly?

23:07.371 --> 23:08.297
Not anymore.

23:08.707 --> 23:10.148
You're wrong.

23:11.886 --> 23:13.236
I have three of them.

23:15.530 --> 23:18.645
They're probably wondering where I am!

23:22.355 --> 23:23.808
What year is it?

23:24.754 --> 23:27.223
Why do you keep asking me that?

23:27.629 --> 23:29.100
Beverly, come on.

23:29.457 --> 23:31.167
Just tell me the year, please.

23:32.426 --> 23:34.600
It's the year 2005.

23:37.396 --> 23:40.061
And you know damn well my name's not Beverly.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.290
It's Allison.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.521
Allison Dubois.

23:54.904 --> 23:56.331
She thought she was you?

23:57.762 --> 23:59.887
Not Joan of Arc, not the Virgin Mary,

24:00.141 --> 24:03.541
not Madam Curie,
but Allison Dubois living in the year 2005 ?

24:04.123 --> 24:05.843
She knew your name.
She knew all the girls' names.

24:05.844 --> 24:07.873
She knew everyone's birthdays.

24:07.991 --> 24:10.431
She named the street we live on, everything.

24:15.006 --> 24:16.671
Does that make me a bigamist?

24:19.706 --> 24:22.701
There's got to be some sort of a logical explanation.

24:23.304 --> 24:26.124
I know. I mean, I keep going over it in my head.

24:26.401 --> 24:27.758
I mean, I know it makes no sense,

24:27.759 --> 24:31.647
but I can't help wondering if maybe I had something to do with this.

24:33.063 --> 24:35.474
Allison, this woman lived half a century ago.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.574
How can you possibly have anything to do with it?

24:37.575 --> 24:38.423
I don't know.

24:38.579 --> 24:41.102
Maybe when I was dreaming about her, I got into her head.

24:41.103 --> 24:44.268
I projected thoughts from the present without realizing it.

24:44.399 --> 24:47.862
Wait a second. Now you're beaming
your brain waves back in time? Come on.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.011
I mean, I don't think so.

24:49.012 --> 24:51.035
Oh, forget it. You know what?

24:51.140 --> 24:53.545
I'm just trying to makes sense out of it.

24:53.931 --> 24:58.540
I can't tell you how eerie it is to sit in a room and watch someone from

24:58.591 --> 25:02.988
before you were born recite all the pertinent facts of your life.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.601
Speaking of which, is my first wife still alive?

25:08.786 --> 25:11.314
She died of amyloidosis in 1962.

25:12.222 --> 25:13.429
Sounds grisly.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.763
What is that, a brain thing?

25:14.764 --> 25:15.929
It's a liver thing.

25:16.170 --> 25:16.991
Uh-huh.

25:17.548 --> 25:18.657
Genetic disorder.

25:26.896 --> 25:27.669
Hey!

25:28.481 --> 25:30.911
Hey. Hey, is that it?

25:30.962 --> 25:33.385
Aren't you going to help me figure out what to do?

25:33.386 --> 25:35.049
What do you mean?
What is there to do?

25:35.050 --> 25:36.445
I mean, a woman's dead.

25:36.497 --> 25:38.162
There's no bringing her back.

25:38.766 --> 25:40.772
You're good, but you're not that good.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.803
Now let your husband get some sleep.

25:42.849 --> 25:44.574
The first Allison always did.

25:53.804 --> 25:56.553
Beverly, I need you to listen to me.

25:57.621 --> 25:59.471
I need you to try to understand.

26:00.393 --> 26:03.235
This was never about me trying to take Anna from you.

26:03.236 --> 26:05.406
I would never keep you from our child.

26:06.764 --> 26:07.951
I know how much you love her,

26:07.952 --> 26:10.722
and I know that you would never try to hurt her.

26:11.898 --> 26:13.445
So, please,
just give her to me.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.123
- No!
- Okay, okay,

26:15.174 --> 26:18.859
just, just. if you don't trust me,
then give her to your sister.

26:23.513 --> 26:25.972
Please, Bev, it's cold out here.

26:26.023 --> 26:29.517
Let's just go back to the house, talk this thing through.

26:30.263 --> 26:34.537
Someday you'll understand all this, Carol, I promise.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.633
And someday, it will all be clear.

26:41.537 --> 26:42.911
No!

26:52.128 --> 26:55.372
Allison, I didn't expect to see you here today.

26:56.798 --> 26:59.198
I just stopped by to do a little research.

27:00.079 --> 27:02.154
Any new progress on the Kercher case?

27:04.191 --> 27:07.001
We still haven't been able to identify that string of numbers you saw.

27:07.002 --> 27:09.632
Best guess is that it's a bank account number.

27:09.970 --> 27:14.480
Although it doesn't seem to match up with any of the accounts in Kercher's name.

27:15.595 --> 27:17.527
You going to be around for a while?

27:17.528 --> 27:20.163
I was just going to do this one thing and go.

27:20.620 --> 27:21.460
Not a problem.

27:21.721 --> 27:24.166
If something changes, I'll give you a call.

27:33.241 --> 27:34.224
Hello?

27:37.346 --> 27:38.502
Carol Waller Smith?

27:40.648 --> 27:41.604
Carol Waller?

27:42.957 --> 27:45.032
Are you the sister of Beverly Waller?

27:45.880 --> 27:46.815
Can I help you?

27:47.029 --> 27:48.064
Well, I hope so.

27:48.955 --> 27:51.900
I work for the District Attorney's office in Phoenix.

27:51.941 --> 27:53.441
My name is Allison Dubois.

27:57.187 --> 28:04.388
So, you want me to try and make sense of something that makes no sense...

28:05.140 --> 28:06.086
Mrs. Dubois.

28:07.622 --> 28:09.242
If that really is your name.

28:10.143 --> 28:11.488
That really is my name.

28:13.378 --> 28:18.545
A mother isn't supposed to want to kill herself, let alone her own child.

28:21.310 --> 28:22.737
And I loved my sister.

28:24.159 --> 28:25.344
Do love my sister.

28:25.674 --> 28:27.989
So ask me whatever you want.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.277
Tell me about her breakdown.

28:34.466 --> 28:36.036
Tell me about what happened.

28:38.630 --> 28:39.835
Well, it was right...

28:41.133 --> 28:44.298
after the birth of her only child, Anna.

28:46.873 --> 28:48.562
She started having nightmares;

28:49.849 --> 28:51.203
terrible dreams...

28:52.055 --> 28:53.440
about her husband Walter.

28:55.624 --> 28:59.144
In them, he was...
doing things.

29:00.457 --> 29:02.011
Terrible things to Anna.

29:02.682 --> 29:03.571
What happened?

29:04.927 --> 29:06.552
I told her to see a doctor.

29:08.072 --> 29:10.562
She saw two or three doctors and they all...

29:11.883 --> 29:13.871
gave her something to help her sleep.

29:13.872 --> 29:15.013
And the more she slept...

29:15.014 --> 29:16.433
The more she had the nightmares.

29:16.434 --> 29:20.159
And she became convinced that she had to get Anna away from Walter.

29:20.734 --> 29:22.364
And that's when she left him.

29:22.365 --> 29:24.950
She and Anna moved in with my husband and me.

29:25.115 --> 29:27.321
Did she ever tell anyone else about her dreams?

29:27.322 --> 29:28.586
Oh, a lot of people.

29:29.430 --> 29:30.780
It didn't help at all.

29:31.952 --> 29:35.084
Walter was so well liked in our town.

29:35.135 --> 29:36.258
He was a war veteran.

29:36.259 --> 29:38.849
He was principal of the junior high school.

29:39.230 --> 29:41.175
He was a man people looked up to.

29:41.569 --> 29:43.323
So when the custody battle started...

29:43.324 --> 29:44.809
It all went Walter's way.

29:46.033 --> 29:47.463
You know, in retrospect...

29:49.249 --> 29:53.265
I think people wished they'd taken my sister a little more seriously.

29:54.988 --> 29:56.743
She may have been crazy, but...

29:58.132 --> 30:01.306
she obviously knew there was something really wrong with Walter.

30:01.307 --> 30:02.332
What do you mean?

30:03.929 --> 30:05.824
I would have thought you'd known.

30:09.145 --> 30:11.215
Several years after Beverly's passing,

30:12.377 --> 30:16.517
a parent at Walter's school marched into his office and shot him to death.

30:19.220 --> 30:22.710
Walter had been molesting his little girl since the sixth grade.

30:31.927 --> 30:34.922
She's psychic, Joe, just like me.
That's the answer.

30:35.598 --> 30:37.682
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
Who's psychic?

30:37.683 --> 30:39.483
Beverly Waller. She had a dream,

30:39.660 --> 30:42.306
a vision that her husband was going to hurt their daughter.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.492
That's why she tried to get her away from him.

30:44.493 --> 30:45.256
Okay.

30:45.432 --> 30:47.060
And that's how she knew so much about me,

30:47.061 --> 30:50.606
about my life-- because she saw it in her mind, in her visions.

30:51.323 --> 30:52.592
But Al, she didn't just see you.

30:52.593 --> 30:54.123
She said that she was you.

30:54.407 --> 30:58.769
Exactly. I don't think she understood what she truly was.

31:00.913 --> 31:05.252
All these terrible images kept popping into her head and she didn't understand why.

31:05.253 --> 31:07.648
When she tried to turn to others for help,

31:07.649 --> 31:12.002
tried to tell them what she was seeing, they told her she was crazy.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.939
And I guess after a while, she believed them.

31:15.237 --> 31:20.229
Al, we're talking about a murderer here, somebody who took the life of her own child.

31:20.614 --> 31:21.412
I know.

31:23.150 --> 31:28.093
I think... I guess that she became convinced that killing Anna was preferable

31:28.144 --> 31:32.184
to whatever torture she saw her husband inflict every night in her dreams.

31:32.419 --> 31:33.724
I still don't get it.

31:33.812 --> 31:34.747
Don't get what?

31:34.897 --> 31:39.959
All right, I understand now how Beverly Waller knew all about our lives back in 1959.

31:41.238 --> 31:45.467
Can you please tell me why she was dreaming about you in the first place?

31:46.513 --> 31:49.553
Or for that matter, why you're dreaming about her now?

31:53.172 --> 31:54.078
Allison?

32:00.199 --> 32:01.259
I have no idea.

32:08.121 --> 32:11.369
Today is July 17, 1959...

32:11.420 --> 32:12.558
Did I miss the previews?

32:12.559 --> 32:15.065
I don't think we're getting any reception in here.

32:15.066 --> 32:18.164
I'm worried if the girls wake up, they're not going to know where we are.

32:18.165 --> 32:19.846
One can only hope.

32:20.795 --> 32:23.105
I'm kidding.
I told them where we were.

32:24.392 --> 32:25.967
They're all out of popcorn.

32:26.493 --> 32:27.878
Mornings are the hardest.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.602
That's when I miss them the most.

32:32.092 --> 32:32.692
Who?

32:32.678 --> 32:34.843
That's what she looks like?
Excellent.

32:34.989 --> 32:35.705
Shh!

32:37.078 --> 32:39.635
Joe... the girls...

32:41.626 --> 32:44.362
The mad dash to get everyone out of the house...

32:45.635 --> 32:46.533
to work...

32:46.921 --> 32:48.008
to school...

32:49.665 --> 32:52.705
You'd think it would become routine, but it never did.

32:52.862 --> 32:55.202
It was always chaos, and...

32:57.021 --> 32:58.706
it was always wonderful.

32:59.275 --> 33:04.005
So, you're a woman from the future trapped in the year 1959.

33:04.762 --> 33:07.387
Is that honestly what you expect me to believe?

33:08.642 --> 33:12.716
Frankly, Doctor, it doesn't matter what you believe.

33:16.735 --> 33:18.625
It only matters what she believes.

33:20.303 --> 33:22.155
She's the only one that matters.

33:28.499 --> 33:30.164
What the hell does that mean?

33:50.458 --> 33:51.524
Hello?

33:52.245 --> 33:55.173
Allison, I hope I'm not calling too late, but I have news.

33:55.174 --> 33:57.259
News? We like news.

33:57.667 --> 34:01.494
That series of numbers that you saw when you were speaking with Timothy Kercher?

34:01.495 --> 34:05.764
Turns out it is a bank account belonging to a Dr. Elaine Doyle.

34:06.237 --> 34:07.696
Doyle, Doyle, Doyle...

34:07.747 --> 34:09.411
Why do I recognize that name?

34:09.625 --> 34:13.070
Probably because you read the same psych evaluation that I did.

34:13.192 --> 34:17.885
The psychiatrist who diagnosed Kercher with dissociative identity disorder.

34:18.047 --> 34:20.927
And would you care to guess who transferred a quarter of a million dollars

34:20.928 --> 34:24.833
into her bank account less than 24 hours after she made that diagnosis?

34:24.945 --> 34:26.620
Let me guess...

34:27.223 --> 34:28.351
Don't tell me.

34:28.418 --> 34:30.438
I see the initials "T" and "K."

34:30.745 --> 34:33.706
The good doctor was arrested a few hours ago and admitted to everything.

34:33.708 --> 34:37.342
It turns out that Kercher didn't just pay her for the evaluation.

34:37.601 --> 34:39.465
He paid her to coach him--

34:39.516 --> 34:44.241
to teach him how to mimic the behavior of a person with dissociative identity disorder.

34:44.527 --> 34:45.732
Does Maggie know yet?

34:45.899 --> 34:46.788
Yeah, I just told her.

34:46.789 --> 34:47.668
She's furious.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.879
She's on the phone with her client right now, insisting he enter a guilty plea.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.007
Hopefully, we'll be able to hammer out a deal in the morning,

34:54.007 --> 34:57.783
and she'll be able to turn her attention to taking care of herself.

34:58.875 --> 34:59.793
She, uh...

35:00.053 --> 35:01.315
just got off the phone.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.846
I-I guess I'll see you in the morning.

35:02.847 --> 35:03.530
Okay.

35:38.162 --> 35:40.940
Someday you'll understand all this, Carol.

35:41.282 --> 35:42.455
I promise!

35:43.919 --> 35:46.102
Someday, it will all be clear.

35:50.904 --> 35:51.625
No!

35:51.676 --> 35:52.439
Beverly...

35:56.706 --> 35:57.633
Allison?

36:05.160 --> 36:07.490
Well, that's $29.99 well spent.

36:16.509 --> 36:18.269
She didn't kill her baby, Joe.

36:18.430 --> 36:21.963
This thing ran on two "D" batteries, honey.
She absolutely killed it.

36:21.964 --> 36:23.470
Not Bridgette.
Beverly.

36:24.237 --> 36:27.274
She was holding a doll the night she threw herself off the bridge.

36:27.275 --> 36:28.328
I'm sorry.
What?

36:28.681 --> 36:31.886
She needed everybody to believe that Anna was dead,

36:31.937 --> 36:33.693
so that nobody would ever go looking for her,

36:33.694 --> 36:36.644
so that her father could never get his hands on her.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.067
She was crazy, all right.
She was crazy like a fox.

36:39.068 --> 36:40.718
She knew exactly what she was doing,

36:40.719 --> 36:44.354
right down to being sure that she had witnesses for the big jump.

36:45.194 --> 36:48.032
The only thing I don't think she counted on was...

36:48.033 --> 36:48.994
surviving it.

36:49.768 --> 36:52.610
But once she did, she had to stick to her story.

36:53.483 --> 36:55.953
She had to let the rest of the world think she'd killed her own kid,

36:55.954 --> 36:57.490
so that no one would try and find her.

36:57.491 --> 37:00.337
So, she spent the rest of her life in an institution.

37:00.338 --> 37:02.376
Even though she wasn't the least bit insane.

37:02.377 --> 37:05.126
So, maybe the reason you've been dreaming about her...

37:05.127 --> 37:07.792
the reason that she claimed to be you when she was in that hospital...

37:07.793 --> 37:09.152
maybe you're supposed to...

37:09.153 --> 37:10.548
to help clear her name,

37:10.599 --> 37:12.098
tell the world that she's not a killer.

37:12.099 --> 37:13.494
No, no, no.

37:13.661 --> 37:15.453
All Beverly ever cared about was her baby.

37:15.454 --> 37:18.039
All she ever wanted to do was to protect her.

37:18.845 --> 37:22.665
She would only be reaching out to me if-if her daughter needed help.

37:23.238 --> 37:27.412
The daughter she stashed away so well that no one even knew she existed for 46 years?

37:27.413 --> 37:30.408
A woman who could be anywhere in the world right now?

37:30.478 --> 37:33.418
Great. Well, tracking her down should take only, what?

37:34.476 --> 37:36.078
Another 46 years.

37:36.317 --> 37:37.200
Give or take.

37:47.843 --> 37:48.850
Mrs. Dubois?

37:49.969 --> 37:51.112
Mrs. Dubois?

37:51.612 --> 37:52.654
Over here.

37:56.652 --> 37:58.510
Mrs. Fulsom, are you okay?

37:59.346 --> 38:00.215
Yeah, more or less.

38:00.216 --> 38:02.886
I just started feeling nauseous all of a sudden.

38:03.637 --> 38:04.526
Can you move?

38:05.478 --> 38:07.273
Probably not without throwing up.

38:07.851 --> 38:10.096
Okay, uh, wait here.
I'll go get some help.

38:10.097 --> 38:11.099
No, no, no, no, no.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.396
Actually, I'd rather you didn't do that.

38:13.397 --> 38:18.317
The last thing I want is some big scene in the garage of the District Attorney's office.

38:18.932 --> 38:19.850
Are you sure?

38:21.444 --> 38:22.751
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

38:22.752 --> 38:25.567
If it doesn't pass, then you can go get somebody.

38:26.486 --> 38:29.609
But for now, I'd just like you to...

38:31.019 --> 38:31.897
sit with me.

38:34.930 --> 38:35.530
Okay.

38:47.996 --> 38:50.261
No, no, no, no, here.
Let me get that.

38:50.493 --> 38:51.524
Here, it's okay.

38:55.572 --> 38:57.237
What I have isn't catching...

38:57.721 --> 38:58.881
if you're wondering.

38:59.008 --> 39:00.538
No, no, I'm not wondering.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.727
It's hereditary.

39:04.755 --> 39:07.945
I wish somebody had told me about that when I was younger.

39:07.946 --> 39:11.306
I wouldn't have wasted so much energy being a control freak.

39:12.580 --> 39:13.668
I'm sorry.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.306
You know what the worst part of it is?

39:16.520 --> 39:19.074
I still can't spell the stupid thing.

39:20.013 --> 39:21.032
No, I'm serious.

39:21.083 --> 39:25.439
If you're gonna drop dead of something, you should at least be able to spell it, right?

39:25.440 --> 39:26.737
I would think so.

39:28.033 --> 39:31.192
I feel always compelled to add the extra "L."

39:32.162 --> 39:33.643
Amyloidosis:

39:33.911 --> 39:35.725
A-m-y-l-o-i...

39:35.914 --> 39:37.625
d-o-s-i-s."

39:38.535 --> 39:40.290
It's a liver condition, right ?

39:41.107 --> 39:42.283
You've heard of it?

39:42.914 --> 39:44.984
I thought that was treatable nowadays.

39:46.033 --> 39:47.230
Nowadays.

39:48.064 --> 39:48.904
I just mean...

39:48.907 --> 39:50.716
in the past, there wasn't much a person could do,

39:50.717 --> 39:54.363
but today, I thought you could address it with a transplant.

39:55.295 --> 39:56.489
It could, in theory.

39:56.966 --> 40:00.288
But, uh, apparently, I'm a tough tissue match.

40:01.423 --> 40:02.808
Well, what about your family?

40:02.809 --> 40:05.614
A live donor could give you a partial transplant...

40:07.675 --> 40:09.229
I'm adopted.

40:13.176 --> 40:14.223
Maggie...

40:15.665 --> 40:17.107
what year were you born?

40:17.915 --> 40:22.420
I know it's a strange question, but I think it might be important.

40:25.812 --> 40:27.310
1959.

40:35.138 --> 40:36.589
All right, repeat after me, Bridge.

40:36.590 --> 40:38.104
- No baths.
- No baths.

40:38.292 --> 40:40.369
- No haircuts.
- No haircuts.

40:40.420 --> 40:41.850
- No makeup.
- No makeup.

40:42.247 --> 40:44.607
Okay, you may now open your doll.

40:51.488 --> 40:52.558
Let's go shopping.

40:53.815 --> 40:57.749
You know, dear, if you just buy them new ones, they don't learn anything.

40:57.750 --> 40:58.700
I know.

40:59.339 --> 41:02.159
But if she hadn't left the old one in the tub...

41:02.386 --> 41:03.948
I figure I owed her one.

41:04.518 --> 41:08.942
So, how did that Maggie person take it when you told her that she was really Anna Waller?

41:08.943 --> 41:10.683
Well, she didn't believe me at first.

41:10.684 --> 41:13.769
Till I brought her to meet Carol Waller and her family.

41:14.692 --> 41:16.685
And now the Wallers have met their long-lost kin,

41:16.686 --> 41:21.516
I'm sure they're just lining up to give this perfect stranger a piece of their livers.

41:21.654 --> 41:25.955
Well, actually, three of them offered to get tested to see if they're a match.

41:25.956 --> 41:28.031
Yeah, but what are the chances of...?

41:28.454 --> 41:30.751
<i>Birds singing in the sycamore tree...</i>

41:30.802 --> 41:33.112
They're all going to match, aren't they?

41:33.892 --> 41:36.222
<i>Dream a little dream of me</i>

41:38.659 --> 41:42.152
<i>Say "nighty-night" and kiss me</i>

41:43.811 --> 41:48.650
Just hold me tight
and tell me you'll miss me

41:49.181 --> 41:53.795
While I'm alone and blue as can be

41:54.092 --> 41:58.357
Dream a little dream of me.

41:58.815 --> 42:00.755
Beverly, did you hear what I said?

42:02.955 --> 42:03.923
No.

42:05.101 --> 42:06.058
I'm sorry.

42:07.810 --> 42:09.791
I was a million miles away.

42:10.820 --> 42:14.690
I was just saying I think we've made a great deal of progress today.

42:15.039 --> 42:16.246
I agree, Doctor.

42:18.399 --> 42:19.834
A great deal of progress.

42:25.806 --> 42:30.701
