WEBVTT

00:06.743 --> 00:08.866
So we're agreed, 20 minutes?

00:09.037 --> 00:10.699
Prue, you can't do a party
in 20 minutes.

00:10.874 --> 00:12.367
- Watch me.
- Prue's party tips:

00:12.541 --> 00:13.621
Meet, greet and bail.

00:13.793 --> 00:15.750
Hey, I'm sorry, but some of us
have a job.

00:15.922 --> 00:17.415
And some of us have fun.

00:17.589 --> 00:19.498
And some of us are having
a really bad hair day.

00:19.674 --> 00:22.380
You know, that is a sign.
Let's turn back now before it's too late.

00:22.553 --> 00:26.718
- Prue, it's never too late for a party.
- It's never too late, Prue.

00:26.892 --> 00:28.599
Remember my sweet 16?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.155 --> 00:40.354
Hey, I have an idea.

00:40.532 --> 00:42.526
Why don't we throw a party
and charge admission.

00:42.702 --> 00:45.703
- It's a great way to make extra cash.
- Hey, I have an even better idea:

00:45.871 --> 00:47.996
Why don't you just get a job.

00:53.381 --> 00:56.832
The sisters Halliwell.
Now the party can begin.

00:57.051 --> 01:00.920
- It's about time you chicks showed.
- Hey, Prue, I'm glad you made it.

01:01.139 --> 01:02.681
Wouldn't miss it for the world, Fritz.

01:02.849 --> 01:05.056
- Marshall, the place looks great.
- Thank you.

01:05.518 --> 01:08.475
We're mostly just restoring it.
I didn't wanna change it too much.

01:08.649 --> 01:10.308
You guys knew the old owners,
didn't you?

01:10.483 --> 01:12.143
Oh, we basically grew up
with their kids.

01:12.319 --> 01:14.989
We probably know the house
better than you guys.

01:15.822 --> 01:19.075
- Hey, how's the bar?
- Oh, dry. I'll take care of it.

01:19.244 --> 01:22.779
No. My turn.

01:26.376 --> 01:28.950
Try and behave, Cynda.
We have guests.

01:29.171 --> 01:31.709
- You know, sisters.
- Tell me about it.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.344
So, listen, enjoy the party.

01:35.555 --> 01:37.927
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:39.225 --> 01:42.927
Okay, I came, I saw, I was perky.

01:43.105 --> 01:45.976
Now I just want my head on a pillow
because I have to wake up early.

01:46.192 --> 01:48.564
No. I mean, not yet.

01:48.736 --> 01:52.235
Yeah, Prue, we just got here.
It wouldn't look good.

01:52.823 --> 01:56.526
- All right, what's going on?
- Going on? What do you mean?

01:58.790 --> 02:02.372
What a coinkidink. Look who's here.

02:05.214 --> 02:06.543
Phoebe, you didn't.

02:06.716 --> 02:09.207
Your fingers weren't doing the walking.
Somebody's had to.

02:09.384 --> 02:12.589
We've been through this, okay?
Cop, witch. It's not a love connection.

02:12.764 --> 02:15.386
Boy, girl. Lighten up.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.478
Hi, Andy.

02:21.649 --> 02:23.974
We're working on their subtlety.

02:24.737 --> 02:27.229
Then it's on to ending hunger
and creating world peace, right?

02:27.782 --> 02:30.699
- What will I do with my Saturday?
- Funny you should ask.

02:30.868 --> 02:33.277
I don't mean to push it,
but I was wondering...

02:33.455 --> 02:36.076
If you're not doing anything,
I kind of have these tickets,

02:36.292 --> 02:39.126
but they're for a Warriors game.
You probably wouldn't be interested.

02:39.294 --> 02:41.621
Well, the team can't do any worse
than they did last year.

02:41.798 --> 02:43.707
Did you see them get creamed
by the Lakers?

02:44.634 --> 02:46.627
Impressive. Is that a yes?

02:48.848 --> 02:52.098
You know, I need to check
my book,

02:52.268 --> 02:54.261
because I might have a thing.

02:54.479 --> 02:56.022
A thing?

02:56.190 --> 03:00.270
- So, Prue, I hear your friend's a cop.
- Inspector, actually.

03:00.444 --> 03:03.528
Oh, yeah. Well,
I got these parking tickets...

03:03.697 --> 03:06.069
Well, my focus is mainly
homicide and robbery.

03:06.241 --> 03:08.568
Yeah, yeah.

03:09.164 --> 03:11.655
- So I have these parking tickets...
- Gotta go.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.998
- Maybe you could...
- Hey, Prue, wait.

03:19.090 --> 03:20.882
Hey, man.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.041
Phoebe.

06:16.505 --> 06:18.083
How big was this dog again?

06:18.257 --> 06:20.630
Huge. Did you see the scratches
on the attic door?

06:20.802 --> 06:22.177
What was it doing in the house?

06:22.345 --> 06:25.096
I don't know. Someone obviously
left the front door open again.

06:25.264 --> 06:28.351
Why do you always assume
it was me? What about Piper?

06:28.561 --> 06:30.054
- Not it.
- Well, it's not a big deal.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.014
We checked the house,
and nothing is missing

06:32.190 --> 06:34.645
except my Pat Boone
Christmas CD.

06:35.443 --> 06:38.017
No, this is really creepy.
If there was a dog in the house,

06:38.196 --> 06:39.360
then it had to have an owner.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.485
No dog I know can open that
front door, let alone reach top shelf.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.369
Hey, maybe we should get
a security system.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.076
No, they are way too expensive.
Besides, after what happened,

06:47.249 --> 06:50.203
Andy will be checking on us
every five minutes.

06:50.419 --> 06:52.992
- You told him.
- Convenient.

06:53.589 --> 06:55.499
- So, what should we do?
- Well,

06:55.675 --> 06:58.677
either we could rely on
our vicious guard cat to protect us,

06:58.845 --> 07:02.130
or we could remember
to lock the doors.

07:03.726 --> 07:06.846
That is a really good idea, Prue.

07:09.191 --> 07:10.686
Yep.

07:15.491 --> 07:17.363
Unlock the door, Phoebe.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.843
I was told that you might
be able to help me.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.758
I'd like to have this...

07:38.976 --> 07:40.090
...appraised.

07:40.268 --> 07:42.760
Well, you would be better off
going to the house's appraiser.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.222
I've been there. He'd need a week.

07:45.399 --> 07:46.809
And I just...

07:46.985 --> 07:50.733
Well, I wouldn't feel right without it.
It's a family heirloom.

07:51.073 --> 07:53.030
I feel like...

07:55.119 --> 07:57.741
I think I've seen a ring
similar to this before.

07:59.081 --> 08:03.709
The setting's quite old.
At least 17th century.

08:04.337 --> 08:07.043
The stones look like chrysolite.

08:07.926 --> 08:10.548
Keep in mind this is just
an educated guess.

08:10.721 --> 08:14.256
Please, guess away.

08:14.683 --> 08:16.759
If I am not mistaken,

08:16.977 --> 08:19.599
it's a stone that the Egyptians
believed would protect them

08:19.772 --> 08:22.774
against spells, curses,
evil spirits.

08:23.653 --> 08:26.358
This wouldn't be a wedding band
by any chance, would it?

08:26.531 --> 08:29.781
- You tell me.
- The stones are set in twos,

08:29.951 --> 08:32.158
the symbol of duality.

08:33.163 --> 08:35.073
Man, woman.

08:35.289 --> 08:38.375
- Again, protection.
- And what does all that tell you?

08:42.006 --> 08:44.212
Where did you get this ring?

08:45.261 --> 08:46.802
What did you say your name was?

08:47.263 --> 08:49.969
I think you know what my name is...

08:50.475 --> 08:52.217
...Prudence.

08:55.398 --> 08:58.268
Get out and stay away from us.

09:04.115 --> 09:05.908
I'm staying at the Beaumark.

09:06.077 --> 09:08.532
What do you say you and your sisters
join me for dinner.

09:09.329 --> 09:10.956
Let's say tomorrow night.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.669
- We can talk.
- After how you abandoned us?

09:14.878 --> 09:16.539
- How dare you.
- Fiery temper.

09:17.297 --> 09:18.958
I like that.

09:19.133 --> 09:23.047
- It reminds me of someone I know.
- I'm nothing like you.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.973
I would never leave my responsibilities
and my family.

09:26.182 --> 09:28.341
I can see we have some issues
to work through.

09:28.518 --> 09:31.436
No, we've got
the whole subscription.

09:32.399 --> 09:34.356
Now get out,
before I have you thrown out.

09:34.901 --> 09:38.105
Is that any way to talk to your father?

09:59.596 --> 10:03.430
I wonder why he went to you first.
I mean, why not Phoebe? Or me?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.427
Piper, it's not like I won the lotto.

10:05.602 --> 10:08.272
What was he like?
Did he ask about us?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.308
Actually, no.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.358
Phoebe, think about it.
He abandoned us.

10:13.528 --> 10:14.858
He was a no-show for 20 years,

10:15.031 --> 10:17.438
and then what, suddenly here he is?
Why now?

10:17.659 --> 10:19.736
Maybe he just wants to be
a part of our lives.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.077
After all this time?
Don't get your hopes up.

10:22.248 --> 10:24.158
Well, there's only one way to find out.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.416
Why wait till dinner?
Let's go see him now.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.413
Will you be rational?

10:28.588 --> 10:31.708
Don't you find it just a little suspicious
that just when we find out...?

10:31.883 --> 10:33.592
Let me get that for you.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.968
Just when we find out
we're witches, he shows up?

10:39.142 --> 10:41.633
But when Mom dies,
he's nowhere to be found.

10:41.853 --> 10:44.641
- He sent us birthday cards.
- Selective memory?

10:47.276 --> 10:49.483
Grams always told us
he was a threat to us.

10:49.654 --> 10:51.980
There's no reason to think
that that's changed.

10:52.157 --> 10:57.532
Prue, it's not that I don't see your
point, but you knew him, we didn't.

10:57.705 --> 10:59.663
Why can't we have a chance
to know him now?

11:01.585 --> 11:04.669
Because we really don't know
why he's here.

11:04.839 --> 11:06.797
And until we do, we can't trust him.

11:19.773 --> 11:21.646
<i>Entrez.</i>

11:40.128 --> 11:41.292
Daddy?

11:45.093 --> 11:47.217
Well, well.

11:47.888 --> 11:50.094
What a nice surprise.

11:50.265 --> 11:52.840
I'm sorry to just show up like this.
I know I was supposed

11:53.019 --> 11:57.647
- to wait for dinner, but I...
- No. Nonsense. Welcome.

11:58.025 --> 12:00.065
Let me get a good look at you.

12:02.196 --> 12:03.823
This is my baby girl.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.858
Little...

12:09.247 --> 12:10.954
...Piper?

12:14.126 --> 12:15.871
Phoebe.

12:16.881 --> 12:18.505
Yeah.

12:18.674 --> 12:21.924
That's okay. People confuse us
all the time.

12:22.137 --> 12:25.720
Are you kidding? I should be
slapped and persecuted.

12:25.891 --> 12:28.429
Let me make it up to you.
How about some room service?

12:28.602 --> 12:31.354
- I just ate, actually.
- A drink? You are legal, right?

12:31.730 --> 12:33.723
Barely, but no, thanks.

12:33.942 --> 12:37.062
- A massage? I can call Lucy back.
- No, really.

12:37.237 --> 12:38.648
I don't want anything.

12:43.370 --> 12:45.992
I just wanted to look at you.

12:50.086 --> 12:52.872
It's like looking in a mirror, isn't it?

12:53.171 --> 12:55.498
You've got your daddy's eyes,
you know that?

12:56.927 --> 12:59.086
I noticed that.

13:02.808 --> 13:04.268
How about a hug?

13:28.547 --> 13:32.047
- They always manage to find me.
- You know, it's okay, I...

13:32.217 --> 13:34.459
I'll just see you at dinner. I gotta go.

13:35.639 --> 13:37.678
Phoebe.

13:37.890 --> 13:39.516
Phoebe, wait.

15:51.753 --> 15:53.415
Andy, what are you doing here?

15:56.301 --> 15:57.961
- Door was open.
- Again?

15:58.178 --> 16:01.843
Yeah, I came by to check up,
and it was open.

16:02.057 --> 16:04.727
I looked around.
Everything seems to be in order.

16:05.688 --> 16:07.513
You want me to check upstairs?

16:08.732 --> 16:11.733
No, no. That's okay, really.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.695
Oh, and about tomorrow night,
I've changed my mind.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.537
- We're on.
- Excuse me?

16:22.039 --> 16:26.667
Well, you'll never believe who popped
back into my life after 20 years.

16:26.837 --> 16:28.211
Victor, my dad.

16:29.048 --> 16:30.921
- Your dad?
- Yeah, he wants to have dinner,

16:31.091 --> 16:32.883
and I would really rather avoid that.

16:33.302 --> 16:35.010
Too bad the game's not tonight.

16:36.766 --> 16:39.435
- Hi, Cynda.
- Hey.

16:40.268 --> 16:42.227
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.100
- Bye.
- Nice party last night.

16:47.444 --> 16:49.686
Guess I'll get going too.

17:23.526 --> 17:26.398
What the hell?

17:36.793 --> 17:39.368
- Prue, you don't know for sure.
- I know plenty.

17:39.547 --> 17:41.419
First, someone rips off the attic door,

17:41.589 --> 17:43.417
<i>then the Book of Shadows
is found downstairs.</i>

17:43.592 --> 17:45.004
Isn't that enough?

17:45.178 --> 17:47.965
<i>Why would somebody want
the Book? Here.</i>

17:48.139 --> 17:50.465
Well, for one reason,
they know what it can do.

17:50.642 --> 17:52.884
They want its power, our power.

17:53.061 --> 17:55.018
But that would mean it's someone
who knows us

17:55.190 --> 17:56.813
and knows that we're witches.

17:57.024 --> 18:00.144
- Yeah, someone like Victor.
- What? Dad?

18:00.363 --> 18:02.603
Look, just think about it.
The moment he shows up,

18:02.780 --> 18:05.023
<i>someone makes two attempts
to grab the Book.</i>

18:05.200 --> 18:08.653
- Coincidence? I think not.
- The craft is a chick thing, Prue.

18:08.871 --> 18:10.949
It's passed on down through
the female line.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.533
There's a good chance Dad
doesn't even know we're charmed.

18:13.752 --> 18:16.540
And there's just as good of a chance
he does.

18:19.133 --> 18:22.503
<i>What would he want with the Book?
And why would he take it from us?</i>

18:25.015 --> 18:26.390
Phoebe, help me out here.

18:28.393 --> 18:30.802
- Phoebe.
- Okay.

18:30.980 --> 18:34.146
Let's just say
for the sake of argument

18:34.316 --> 18:37.403
that he is after it.
Wouldn't he have taken it with him?

18:37.572 --> 18:38.982
He wouldn't have left it behind.

18:39.156 --> 18:42.110
Okay, we have to call the cops
and report it as a break-in.

18:42.286 --> 18:43.365
And tell them what?

18:43.787 --> 18:46.492
That someone broke into our house
to try and steal our broomsticks?

18:46.665 --> 18:49.073
I mean, please. Besides,
Andy's already been here.

18:49.501 --> 18:53.417
Oh, so Andy was here again.
Talk about convenient.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.879
Did you ever think
of pointing the finger at him?

18:56.176 --> 18:58.384
He's probably the one
who scared Victor away.

18:58.596 --> 19:02.345
Until we find out what's going on
and whether Victor is involved or not,

19:02.808 --> 19:04.185
<i>we've got to hide the Book.</i>

19:04.352 --> 19:06.725
Either that, or we can't leave
the house.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.691
<i>Fine. Then we hide the Book,
because I'm going to dinner tonight.</i>

19:09.859 --> 19:12.433
- I wanna see Dad.
- So do I.

19:12.904 --> 19:14.612
I've already seen him.

19:20.496 --> 19:22.702
Girls, it's so nice to see you.

19:22.916 --> 19:24.909
It's not like we don't have
a lot to talk about.

19:25.127 --> 19:26.703
We do.

19:26.879 --> 19:30.295
I mean, yeah,
we have a few questions.

19:31.550 --> 19:33.591
You know, the last time
we ate together,

19:33.761 --> 19:35.553
you would only eat food
that was white.

19:35.764 --> 19:39.892
- I'm glad to see you've outgrown it.
- That's right. I was 4.

19:40.478 --> 19:42.934
And, Phoebe, that would've
made you what, 1?

19:43.814 --> 19:47.479
You know, you couldn't walk yet,
but you could swim.

19:47.651 --> 19:49.063
You were a fish.

19:53.118 --> 19:54.991
This feels right, doesn't it?

19:55.327 --> 19:57.997
It feels natural. Almost like normal.

19:58.205 --> 20:01.209
Almost. It's just...

20:02.044 --> 20:06.209
Well, why? I mean, after all this time,
why here, why now?

20:06.759 --> 20:08.465
Well, I heard the food
is pretty good here.

20:08.761 --> 20:10.718
And it is dinnertime.

20:13.723 --> 20:15.135
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

20:16.393 --> 20:18.185
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

20:33.747 --> 20:36.155
My plans for tonight fell through.
Figured I'd stop by.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.301
And then, all of a sudden, there
he was. He just showed up at work.

20:52.478 --> 20:54.684
I can't believe it.
How are you dealing?

20:54.897 --> 20:57.982
Honestly, I'm not.

20:58.150 --> 20:59.432
I don't blame you.

20:59.986 --> 21:02.857
- What do you think he wants?
- Dinner.

21:03.031 --> 21:05.783
Piper and Phoebe
are there with him now.

21:06.453 --> 21:08.326
You know,
they just don't understand.

21:08.829 --> 21:10.372
They don't know him like I do.

21:11.082 --> 21:13.574
I can't believe I let them go.

21:14.504 --> 21:15.831
I can't believe they went.

21:16.965 --> 21:21.176
He's acting like no time has passed,
like I'm still his little girl, and I'm not.

21:23.138 --> 21:25.890
There are things
that I wanna tell him.

21:26.516 --> 21:29.518
I want him to know what he missed.
You know, like...

21:29.687 --> 21:31.845
...the time I broke my arm.

21:32.023 --> 21:35.275
Or the day that I finally passed
my driver's test. Our prom.

21:35.778 --> 21:37.985
Didn't we miss that too?

21:42.993 --> 21:45.117
I want him to know.

21:46.332 --> 21:47.991
I want him to want to know.

21:49.711 --> 21:51.503
And I'm sorry, but I also want
some answers.

21:51.713 --> 21:54.500
Like, where the hell has he been
my whole life?

21:54.674 --> 21:57.048
Why didn't he come back until now?

21:57.219 --> 21:59.461
He needs to know
that that's not okay.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.925
So tell him.

22:04.103 --> 22:05.561
I'll drop you off.

22:18.827 --> 22:20.109
Prudence.

22:22.331 --> 22:24.123
Did I miss much?

22:24.333 --> 22:27.251
Just catch-up. Dad was filling us in.

22:27.420 --> 22:28.750
- Memory lane.
- Has he mentioned

22:28.923 --> 22:31.129
- where he's been all of our lives?
- Prue.

22:31.300 --> 22:34.218
I don't understand.
If you can afford a spread like this,

22:34.387 --> 22:37.057
why didn't you help out
when Grams died?

22:37.307 --> 22:39.845
- We actually could've used it then.
- Give him a chance, Prue.

22:40.018 --> 22:42.142
Dad's explained.
The money, all this, it's new.

22:42.355 --> 22:44.313
It's okay, Piper, I'm a big boy.

22:44.899 --> 22:47.901
I didn't come back earlier because
I was afraid I might disappoint you.

22:48.111 --> 22:50.863
- Too late.
- Wonder what's keeping that dessert.

22:52.366 --> 22:54.076
Please, sit down.
Have something to eat.

22:54.286 --> 22:57.203
- I'm not hungry.
- Always in a hurry, Prue.

22:57.372 --> 22:59.532
You skipped crawling
and went straight to walking.

22:59.709 --> 23:01.747
Oh, we're sharing memories.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.542
Well, I've got one of my own.
Your back, walking out the door.

23:28.158 --> 23:31.362
- Who wants flambé?
- Nice reflexes.

23:32.787 --> 23:36.123
Now, let me get this straight.
Piper, you freeze time.

23:36.376 --> 23:39.163
Prue, don't you move objects?

23:40.547 --> 23:43.168
And what's your special trick, Phoebe?
Premonitions?

23:45.136 --> 23:47.971
Maybe we should
talk about this elsewhere.

24:10.665 --> 24:12.908
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

24:13.627 --> 24:17.293
- Get out. Now.
- No. You've gotta get out.

24:17.506 --> 24:20.462
- We've got it under control.
- No, you don't.

24:20.636 --> 24:23.007
Because they're on their way back.

24:23.931 --> 24:25.305
I thought you were in charge.

24:25.515 --> 24:28.435
<i>Look, shape-shift into yourselves,
and we'll get back to the Book later.</i>

24:28.604 --> 24:32.553
- Nice plan, Marshall.
- Don't piss me off, Fritz.

24:32.774 --> 24:35.396
How was I supposed to know Prue
would come back with her sisters?

24:35.610 --> 24:38.280
The little witch was supposed to be
out on a date with that cop.

24:38.447 --> 24:40.606
You really think you would've
been able to trick Prue

24:40.783 --> 24:42.657
<i>into getting the Book
out of the house?</i>

24:42.828 --> 24:46.779
Well, we sure as hell can't now,
can we?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.826
So, what now, genius?

24:50.837 --> 24:53.162
We kill them.

25:03.894 --> 25:06.811
Cynda, heel.

25:09.358 --> 25:11.684
Plenty of time for that later.

25:13.030 --> 25:14.108
Heel.

25:30.549 --> 25:32.341
Friends of yours?

25:42.814 --> 25:45.270
So someone left a window open,
which is probably how

25:45.441 --> 25:47.731
the birds got in.
What is so funny?

25:47.903 --> 25:50.858
Do you remember the day
this was taken?

25:51.074 --> 25:53.944
Yeah. Family picnic. It rained.

25:54.118 --> 25:56.444
And your mother packed us all up,
and she brought us home.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.195
And we had the picnic
right here in the living room.

25:59.374 --> 26:01.368
- You remember that, Prue?
- Barely.

26:01.586 --> 26:03.081
Prue.

26:05.466 --> 26:07.125
This one.

26:08.386 --> 26:12.300
This one was at
one of your piano recitals.

26:12.473 --> 26:15.046
Not a very good shot. My fault.

26:16.144 --> 26:17.971
I had to take the pictures that day.

26:18.146 --> 26:21.018
Your mother was too busy
holding her breath.

26:21.901 --> 26:24.191
If you look closely...

26:24.362 --> 26:27.316
You see there? That's her.

26:27.783 --> 26:30.238
I never noticed that before.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.703
And this one used to be a 5-by-7.

26:39.045 --> 26:41.252
When I was still in it.

26:43.843 --> 26:45.670
I think Grams cut you out.

26:45.887 --> 26:47.631
There's a bunch of other stuff
in the attic.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.632
Grams left us so many things.

26:49.851 --> 26:52.768
- That's not all she left us.
- Phoebe, let's not go there.

26:53.104 --> 26:55.145
What? It's not like he doesn't
already know.

26:55.357 --> 26:58.523
And I'm sorry, but it's kind of a relief
to talk to someone about it.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.777
Does anybody want coffee?

27:00.947 --> 27:03.319
I mean, one day I'm a member
of the Y generation

27:03.532 --> 27:06.368
with average hair and a thing
for caffeinated beverages,

27:06.536 --> 27:08.695
and the next, I am a witch.

27:09.497 --> 27:12.285
Dad, do you take cream
or sugar with that?

27:12.459 --> 27:16.042
<i>I just read from the Book,
and wham, I am Tabitha.</i>

27:16.798 --> 27:20.167
The only thing is, is I got stuck
with the power to see the future.

27:20.344 --> 27:21.886
- How uncool is that?
- Well,

27:22.054 --> 27:24.545
from what your mother always said,
it was actually considered

27:24.723 --> 27:26.466
one of the more desirable powers.

27:26.852 --> 27:28.973
Unless you see things
you don't desire.

27:30.856 --> 27:33.940
So how long have you known?
About us, our powers. How long?

27:34.150 --> 27:35.479
I didn't.

27:35.652 --> 27:38.227
I knew there was a possibility.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.818
That's why I came back.

27:40.033 --> 27:43.154
To find out. Must've happened
when your grandmother died, right?

27:43.370 --> 27:46.242
<i>Yep. I just read an incantation
from the Book, and...</i>

27:46.416 --> 27:48.124
Phoebe.

27:48.501 --> 27:52.416
<i>The Book of Shadows.
Not exactly summer reading.</i>

27:52.630 --> 27:57.044
Is it still up in the attic?
You know, I haven't seen it in years.

27:57.594 --> 27:58.876
Mind if I have a look?

28:08.148 --> 28:11.732
- Disappointed.
- Patience, my sweet.

28:11.903 --> 28:14.027
Patience is highly overrated.

28:14.198 --> 28:15.775
We could've destroyed them
right there.

28:15.949 --> 28:18.441
<i>Then we'd have three dead witches
and no way to get the Book.</i>

28:18.619 --> 28:20.777
- Where would that put us?
- Satisfied.

28:20.955 --> 28:24.540
<i>I still like my idea. We kill two of them
and force the third to get the Book out.</i>

28:24.710 --> 28:27.746
Let me explain this once again
for the cerebrally impaired.

28:27.921 --> 28:30.378
These are not schoolgirls
we're dealing with.

28:30.592 --> 28:32.384
These are good witches.

28:32.552 --> 28:36.052
We cannot alert them
to our presence.

28:36.223 --> 28:39.141
At their full strength, battling them...

28:39.310 --> 28:43.178
<i>...would be unpleasant. However,
once we possess the Book,</i>

28:43.773 --> 28:45.184
we get its powers.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.526
We weaken theirs,
and they're easy prey.

28:48.987 --> 28:52.819
You know, that sounds good
in theory,

28:53.033 --> 28:54.908
but we've already tried everything.

28:57.872 --> 29:00.115
We still have Victor.

29:00.334 --> 29:02.126
What exactly are you
accusing me of, Prue?

29:02.295 --> 29:04.418
- Figure it out.
- Come on, Prue, take it easy.

29:04.589 --> 29:05.964
Are you kidding me?

29:06.132 --> 29:08.587
Am I the only one who sees
what's going on here?

29:08.759 --> 29:10.421
Couldn't we all just take
a deep breath...?

29:10.596 --> 29:13.550
Think about it, Piper.
What, he wines and dines us,

29:13.724 --> 29:16.097
now he's back in a house
he hasn't set foot in in 20 years,

29:16.269 --> 29:19.020
<i>and the first thing he wants to know is
where's the Book of Shadows?</i>

29:19.188 --> 29:22.560
You're just looking for something
to blame him for.

29:22.736 --> 29:24.359
Admit it.

29:24.821 --> 29:27.858
- Tell them why you're here.
- Prue, stop.

29:28.617 --> 29:31.867
For the first time in your life,
Victor, tell them the truth.

29:32.789 --> 29:34.662
All right, fine.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.749
<i>You're right. I am after the Book.</i>

29:39.921 --> 29:42.757
That's exactly the reason
why I came back.

29:43.468 --> 29:44.499
Dad?

29:44.677 --> 29:47.595
But not for the reasons
you would like to believe.

29:49.058 --> 29:52.593
That would make it easy for you,
Prue, wouldn't it? If I were evil?

29:52.770 --> 29:54.976
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
I'm not.

29:55.147 --> 29:57.556
- I'm here to protect you.
- Yeah, right.

29:57.734 --> 30:00.900
- To protect us from what?
- From yourselves.

30:01.070 --> 30:03.990
That's why I want that damn book.

30:04.159 --> 30:07.991
It's where the power of three started.
And it's where it must end.

30:08.205 --> 30:10.032
But it's part of us,
it's part of who we are.

30:10.207 --> 30:12.663
That's what your mother
believed too.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.419
Before they killed her.

30:15.838 --> 30:17.748
- What are you saying?
- You have no idea

30:18.174 --> 30:21.175
- what evil is out there.
- Oh, I think we've got a good idea.

30:21.344 --> 30:24.678
Listen to me, Prue.
That book is a magnet for evil.

30:25.433 --> 30:30.677
As long as you have it, as long
as you use it, you're in danger.

30:30.898 --> 30:33.021
- All of you.
- You are unbelievable.

30:33.192 --> 30:35.065
After all these years of being
an absentee dad,

30:35.235 --> 30:37.942
then you waltz back into our lives
and try and tell us how to live?

30:38.115 --> 30:40.486
I never wanted you to have
those powers in the first place.

30:40.660 --> 30:43.696
I battled with your grandmother
after your mom died.

30:43.913 --> 30:47.862
She wanted you to find out you were
witches when you grew up. I didn't.

30:48.041 --> 30:51.626
I fought for you. Hard.

30:52.131 --> 30:54.337
Your grandmother was too strong.

30:54.508 --> 30:57.842
Wait, you're blaming Grams
for why you disappeared?

30:58.012 --> 31:01.298
- She loved us. She raised us.
- What'd she do, put a spell on you?

31:01.474 --> 31:04.974
Believe me, nothing short of that
would've kept me away.

31:05.187 --> 31:09.850
You have to believe me.
All I want is what's best for you.

31:14.113 --> 31:17.449
Phoebe, you believe me, don't you?

31:21.080 --> 31:25.578
- We've done fine without you.
- Prue, you can't fight this.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.661
- I couldn't.
- I'm not you.

31:27.881 --> 31:29.209
Are you sure?

31:29.423 --> 31:32.093
Are you sure you can protect
your sisters forever?

31:32.302 --> 31:34.923
- We'll protect each other.
- Then you'll die together.

31:35.138 --> 31:37.297
No one can hurt us as bad as you.

31:54.912 --> 31:57.747
If you wanted me to leave,

31:57.915 --> 32:00.122
all you had to do...

32:02.003 --> 32:03.034
...was ask.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.303
Why did you have to do that?

32:14.475 --> 32:17.262
- Did you have to throw him so hard?
- Piper.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.938
We could've just, you know,
talked about it, like normal people.

32:21.234 --> 32:23.191
We're not normal.

32:56.482 --> 32:58.310
Hello, Victor.

32:59.235 --> 33:02.902
- Where have you been?
- How did you get in here?

33:03.074 --> 33:07.237
I think that you should be
a little more concerned with...

33:07.413 --> 33:09.618
...what we're doing in here.

33:11.750 --> 33:15.286
I was wondering when evil
would rear its ugly head.

33:15.464 --> 33:18.038
Consider it reared.
I don't know the kind of people

33:18.217 --> 33:22.167
you're used to dealing with,
but I'd lay serious coin

33:22.346 --> 33:25.763
that they aren't willing
to rip you into a thousand pieces

33:25.934 --> 33:27.926
and dance in your entrails.

33:28.102 --> 33:30.771
Oh, so you're lawyers.

33:30.982 --> 33:33.306
And here I was assuming
you were shape-shifters.

33:33.483 --> 33:36.320
Those are clever words for a man
about to be an appetizer.

33:36.488 --> 33:39.691
Cocky words for a man who can't get
a simple book out of a house.

33:39.867 --> 33:41.943
Close your mouth.
I mean, it's obvious.

33:42.119 --> 33:45.121
You're gonna shape-shift into me
and try to get to the girls that way.

33:45.289 --> 33:47.199
Am I right?

33:47.417 --> 33:49.208
- It won't work.
- Why not?

33:49.420 --> 33:51.495
- Do you mind if I poke holes?
- Poke away.

33:51.712 --> 33:55.415
After tonight, the girls won't let me
or anything that looks like me

33:55.635 --> 33:57.379
back into their lives,
let alone the house.

33:57.554 --> 34:01.338
I've officially been kicked out.
There is, however,

34:01.516 --> 34:05.015
one sister I can reach. Phoebe.

34:05.188 --> 34:08.639
So why don't I just become you,
and I'll reach her?

34:08.815 --> 34:12.020
Because only her real father
would know what buttons to push.

34:12.195 --> 34:14.687
The ones that would get me back in.

34:14.864 --> 34:19.077
If you kill me,
you'll never know what they are.

34:19.245 --> 34:21.784
You'll never get back into the house...

34:22.706 --> 34:25.377
<i>...and you'll never get
the Book of Shadows.</i>

34:38.266 --> 34:40.556
Good morning, Phoebe.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.319
Guys,

34:47.487 --> 34:51.353
can we call a truce
just for five minutes, please?

34:52.326 --> 34:53.784
I have a confession.

34:54.118 --> 34:58.698
Remember when we agreed
to not see Dad?

34:58.999 --> 35:00.992
Yeah, well...

35:01.210 --> 35:02.872
...I did.

35:03.047 --> 35:05.798
- Hello, I was with you.
- No.

35:06.175 --> 35:08.927
By myself, before dinner.

35:09.095 --> 35:15.631
And I had a premonition about Dad
when he hugged me.

35:16.312 --> 35:18.555
<i>He was stealing
the Book of Shadows.</i>

35:18.857 --> 35:21.692
Yeah, you were right
about him, Prue.

35:22.068 --> 35:25.105
But I didn't want the premonition
to be true.

35:25.780 --> 35:27.774
I was hoping,

35:27.950 --> 35:31.783
praying that there was
a perfectly good explanation for it.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.746
Hoping that...

35:35.667 --> 35:39.166
That he was really here
to be with us.

35:39.839 --> 35:42.591
I just wanted him back in our lives.

35:45.762 --> 35:47.802
He's our dad.

35:49.893 --> 35:53.143
I know, Phoebe. I know.

36:03.116 --> 36:06.402
Hey. Look.

36:08.872 --> 36:11.578
It's Dad's ring. What's it doing here?

36:13.168 --> 36:15.956
It must've slipped off when he...

36:16.382 --> 36:17.839
...fell.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.721
Well, I'll have it sent back
to the hotel.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.350
Don't be afraid.

36:34.528 --> 36:36.733
What are you...? You have to leave.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.814
Phoebe, please,
this is very important.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.570
I can't. I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

36:42.662 --> 36:45.663
<i>Phoebe, you gotta get the Book
out of the house.</i>

36:45.873 --> 36:49.040
- You have to leave.
- Phoebe, trust me.

36:49.252 --> 36:51.126
Look.

37:06.481 --> 37:08.520
Excuse me. Hey.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.600
Is this guy bothering you?

37:11.237 --> 37:13.942
No. This is my...

37:14.449 --> 37:17.865
- This is Victor.
- We were just saying goodbye.

37:18.077 --> 37:20.912
Yeah. I gotta run.

37:25.128 --> 37:27.797
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

37:29.967 --> 37:31.543
<i>Dad's not after the Book.
It's Marshall.</i>

37:31.717 --> 37:32.916
- He's what?
- The premonition.

37:33.136 --> 37:34.965
It wasn't Dad. Gotta find a spell
and banish them.

37:35.181 --> 37:36.509
- Banish who?
- The neighbours.

37:36.682 --> 37:39.387
They're shape-shifters.
Fritz and Marshall and the...

37:39.560 --> 37:42.265
Cookies. Just baked.

37:42.605 --> 37:45.013
Hey. The door was unlocked.

37:46.902 --> 37:50.487
- Where you going, Pheebs?
- Just to get something.

37:51.033 --> 37:53.156
Will you save me a cookie?

37:54.453 --> 37:56.861
- Okay.
- Daddy's home.

38:03.379 --> 38:05.420
Come on, come on.

38:05.591 --> 38:08.544
I have no idea what I'm looking for.

38:09.512 --> 38:11.553
Okay. I can take a hint.

38:15.143 --> 38:18.643
<i>"When in the circle that is home
Safety's gone and evils roam</i>

38:18.855 --> 38:23.234
<i>Rid all beings from these walls
Save sisters three, now heed our call"</i>

38:23.403 --> 38:26.025
<i>Rid all beings from these walls
Save sisters three</i>

38:26.198 --> 38:28.357
<i>Now heed our call
Okay.</i>

38:32.038 --> 38:37.329
Dad, you can't be here.
You have to leave now.

38:37.502 --> 38:39.163
Whoa! Timeout.
What's going on here?

38:39.338 --> 38:42.090
Don't worry about it, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:42.258 --> 38:43.753
- Don't trust him.
- Wait a sec.

38:43.927 --> 38:47.628
Last week, we have no dad,
and now we have two?

38:47.806 --> 38:49.135
Phoebe, remember?

38:49.308 --> 38:53.057
Remember when you were little,
and you were afraid of the dark?

38:53.270 --> 38:56.308
And I would leave the hall light on
and the door open just a crack?

38:56.483 --> 38:59.568
Oh, that's original.
What kid isn't afraid of the dark?

38:59.779 --> 39:00.892
Prue.

39:01.237 --> 39:03.564
- She's never been afraid of anything.
- He's right, Prue.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.696
- You were never afraid of the dark.
- Lucky guess.

39:06.870 --> 39:08.862
I said I came back to protect you.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.917
Now there's only one way to do it.
Kill us both.

39:13.043 --> 39:15.582
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

39:15.755 --> 39:17.795
Just do it, because I wanna go out
with a bang.

39:18.008 --> 39:20.002
- Do it, Phoebe.
- The spell will kill everyone,

39:20.178 --> 39:22.003
including Dad.

39:22.178 --> 39:24.053
This is the only way.

39:25.142 --> 39:28.926
- Prudence.
- Prue, the protection ring.

39:36.905 --> 39:38.104
Phoebe, now.

39:38.324 --> 39:40.067
<i>In the circle that is home</i>

39:41.119 --> 39:43.954
<i>Safety's gone and evils roam</i>

39:44.163 --> 39:45.956
<i>Rid all beings from these walls</i>

39:46.125 --> 39:49.873
<i>Save sisters three
Now heed our call</i>

39:50.087 --> 39:51.997
<i>When in the circle that is home</i>

39:52.173 --> 39:54.842
<i>Safety's gone and evils roam</i>

39:55.051 --> 39:57.756
- Daddy!
- It's okay. Keep it going.

39:57.971 --> 40:00.593
<i>Rid all beings from these walls</i>

40:00.766 --> 40:04.015
<i>Save sisters three
Now heed our call</i>

40:13.489 --> 40:16.739
For a moment there,
I wasn't sure what you would do.

40:16.909 --> 40:18.487
For a moment there, neither was I.

40:18.661 --> 40:20.619
I thought you didn't want us
to use our magic.

40:20.789 --> 40:21.952
I didn't.

40:22.584 --> 40:26.284
Not as long as I still thought of you
as my little girls.

40:26.463 --> 40:28.539
But you're obviously not anymore.

40:29.007 --> 40:33.172
- We're still your little girls. We're just...
- Witches.

40:33.930 --> 40:37.381
Yeah. Witches.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.974
Who obviously don't need
your old man

40:41.146 --> 40:43.520
to protect you from anything.

40:58.374 --> 41:00.747
No, Andy, I'm fine, really.
Dad's gonna be here any minute,

41:00.918 --> 41:03.077
so can I take a rain check on dinner?

41:03.255 --> 41:06.458
Okay, no.
Thanks for the good advice. Bye.

41:06.633 --> 41:08.258
So he's "Dad" now?

41:08.428 --> 41:11.263
Yes, Phoebe, he is. And by the way,
my dress looks good on you, but...

41:11.681 --> 41:13.590
I don't have any nice clothes, Prue.

41:13.809 --> 41:15.553
- Dad said it was casual.
- I don't care.

41:15.728 --> 41:17.304
I wanna look nice for him.

41:17.478 --> 41:20.053
Who knows how long it'll be
before we see him again?

41:20.234 --> 41:21.810
You don't think he's gonna
stay around?

41:21.984 --> 41:27.193
Well, let's just say I no longer have
a romanticized image of him,

41:27.365 --> 41:29.940
and I'm glad about that, actually.

41:30.119 --> 41:32.610
At least Dad is real now.

41:32.830 --> 41:35.582
And at least he's not a monster,
which is very reassuring,

41:35.750 --> 41:38.788
considering we share his genes.

41:39.923 --> 41:42.378
I'm just glad he came back,
no matter how long he stays.

41:42.550 --> 41:45.303
Kind of nice feeling like
a normal family again.

41:45.471 --> 41:47.594
Whatever that means.

41:51.227 --> 41:53.433
Speak of the devil.

41:57.402 --> 41:59.144
Hi. You must be Mr Wyatt.

42:00.029 --> 42:01.772
The handyman?

42:01.989 --> 42:03.982
- Call me Leo.
- Gladly.

42:04.491 --> 42:08.194
- This was on the steps.
- Oh, thanks.

42:08.872 --> 42:10.700
This place is...

42:10.875 --> 42:12.582
You don't find many
like this one anymore.

42:12.795 --> 42:16.459
- Yeah, it's kind of falling apart.
- Well, the problem isn't the manor.

42:17.049 --> 42:19.504
It's the manner in which
it was treated.

42:20.051 --> 42:21.712
I'd love to see more if...

42:22.346 --> 42:24.837
And I would love to show it to you.

42:25.182 --> 42:27.472
The attic is right this way.

42:27.644 --> 42:30.349
- Guys.
- Oh, I'll be right up.

42:31.691 --> 42:34.443
- He's not coming.
- Who's not coming?

42:34.653 --> 42:37.440
Dad. But he sent this.

42:37.615 --> 42:39.738
"Girls, something's come up.
I had to leave town.

42:39.909 --> 42:44.072
Can't make dinner. Probably best
if we let the dust settle anyway.

42:44.248 --> 42:46.869
I know there's a lot you would like
to forget, but here's

42:47.042 --> 42:48.666
what I remember. Love, Dad."

42:53.173 --> 42:55.416
<i>What'd you get? What's in there?
You can open...</i>

42:58.304 --> 43:02.384
<i>- It's like magic!
- A bunny!</i>

43:02.560 --> 43:03.889
<i>What is it?</i>

43:04.062 --> 43:06.351
<i>- Come here, come here, come here.
- What is it?</i>

43:07.941 --> 43:09.732
<i>What is it?</i>

43:18.204 --> 43:19.994
<i>What is it?</i>

43:20.163 --> 43:22.654
<i>- What's in the box?
- Again? Oh, God.</i>

43:22.832 --> 43:25.040
<i>A bunny!</i>

43:27.713 --> 43:30.003
Oh, Prudence.

43:30.509 --> 43:33.178
Look at that face.
Look at that face.

43:33.470 --> 43:36.758
<i>- Who is it?
- Hey, Piper.</i>

43:43.857 --> 43:45.316
What's in there?

43:45.484 --> 43:48.106
- What do you got, Phoebe?
- Barbie.

43:48.321 --> 43:49.982
<i>- Yes!
- Barbie!</i>
