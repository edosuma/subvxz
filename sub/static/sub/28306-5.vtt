WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:06.180
Fosse/Verdon.

00:08.312 --> 00:11.011
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.142 --> 00:15.232
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.327
He was a real spurter.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.894
Yeah, must have had
high blood pressure.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.156
Should probably see a physician.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.418
Well, he definitely should now.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.117
Oh, Laszlo, I feel wild.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.554
I want to do something
stupid and crazy.

00:32.597 --> 00:35.339
All right. What say
we retire to our bedchamber

00:35.383 --> 00:38.342
and slip into some
informal evening wear?

00:38.386 --> 00:40.910
And by that, I mean the nude.

00:40.953 --> 00:44.305
Oh, Laszlo.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.307
Laszlo?

00:46.350 --> 00:48.135
Shh. Look.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.007
That's our new neighbor, Phil.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.010
Digestif, my darkest princess?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.360
Laszlo, we've just eaten.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.796
I want to do
something different.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.365
Well, why don't I eat
and you watch?

01:01.409 --> 01:02.453
That's kinky.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.151
Is it?

01:04.194 --> 01:06.675
Bickering like
a couple of ninnies.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.330
I know, right?
It's like, "Sheesh. We get it.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.896
You've been together
for centuries."

01:10.940 --> 01:12.985
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.813
Those are vampires.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.337
You don't get to insult them.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.252
-I was just...
-You're not a vampire.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.557
-I'm sorry, Master.
-Geez.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.124
I mean, come on,
we get it already.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.300
You've been married
for centuries.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.694
Watch this.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.261
Bat.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.572
Just get on with it, Laszlo.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.273
Come to me, Phil.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.058
Submit to my dark power.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.279
Submit
to my dark power.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.368
When was the last time
I felt his dark power?

01:47.411 --> 01:49.848
I say come to me, Phil.

01:49.892 --> 01:53.417
-I'm not staying for this.
You're being very boring.
-Submit to my dark power.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.812
-WOMAN: Phil? I'm home.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.814
-Phil? Who are you talking to?
-LASZLO: Shit. Bat!

02:07.475 --> 02:08.867
-Oh!
-NANDOR: Oh, shit.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.173
GUILLERMO:
The fuck?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.392
BOTH:
Ooh...

02:13.698 --> 02:16.266
♪ Don't sing if you want
to live long♪

02:16.310 --> 02:18.660
♪ They have no use
for your song♪

02:18.703 --> 02:21.184
♪ You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead♪

02:21.228 --> 02:23.708
♪ You're dead
and out of this world♪

02:25.710 --> 02:28.844
♪ Now your hope and compassion
is gone♪

02:28.887 --> 02:31.455
♪ You sold out your dream

02:31.499 --> 02:33.979
♪ Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead♪

02:34.023 --> 02:36.547
♪ You're dead
and out of this world.♪

02:45.469 --> 02:47.689
-Come on.
-COLIN: What's going on?

02:47.732 --> 02:50.213
-NANDOR: Laszlo was over
at Phil's house.
-COLIN: Okay.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.433
NANDOR:
And Phil's girlfriend hit him
over the head

02:52.476 --> 02:53.999
-and knocked him unconscious.
-COLIN: Okay.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.697
NANDOR:
So now we need to rescue him.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.002
COLIN:
Well, where's Nadja, though?

02:57.046 --> 02:59.266
NANDOR:
I don't know.

02:59.309 --> 03:03.357
NADJA:  Obviously, being in a marriage  for centuries can get boring.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.489
And it is in these moments
of dissatisfaction

03:05.533 --> 03:10.277
that I think about
my human ex-lover, Gregor.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.280
Oh, he is the most
fantastic of men.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.109
If I did have to give
one criticism, though,

03:17.153 --> 03:19.286
it would be that he did
accidentally get

03:19.329 --> 03:21.288
his head cut off
in every life he's had.

03:22.332 --> 03:25.727
Such short, sweet lives.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.208
Shit. Shit, shit.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.865
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.261
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please take the ticket.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.959
Holy shit. Wow.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.526
NADJA: He has been reincarnated again.

03:42.570 --> 03:45.399
And in this life,
he is called Jep...

03:45.442 --> 03:47.401
Jean. Jange.

03:47.444 --> 03:51.753
Uh, no, it's, um, Jex.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.277
Jesh. Jenk?

03:54.321 --> 03:57.454
It-it sounds like Jesh.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.674
But, no doubt,
he has been reborn

03:59.717 --> 04:01.545
as another heroic figure.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.112
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no!

04:03.155 --> 04:04.635
I told you guys, okay,
you're not supposed

04:04.679 --> 04:06.768
to come in here unless
you have a car, all right?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.422
And, uh, those don't
look like cars, so...

04:08.465 --> 04:10.641
You're not a cop, man.
-I'm not a...

04:10.685 --> 04:13.514
-You can't tell us what to do.
-All right,
I'm taking your name down.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.732
I'm taking your name down. Hey.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.517
In the camouflage.
I can still see you.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.519
NANDOR:
All right,

04:18.562 --> 04:21.652
one of us needs to be invited inand get Laszlo.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.437
I am nominating Guillermo,

04:23.480 --> 04:25.308
because I am too foreign
and you are too boring.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.397
Well, Guillermo doesn't need
to be invited,

04:27.441 --> 04:29.181
as he's a human being.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.662
I would prefer to be invited in.It's more polite.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.230
Actually, it looks
like it's a moot point.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.931
They've stolen Laszlo.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.070
I'm not approaching him.
Just going to watch.

05:00.387 --> 05:04.391
Gregor. Gregor.

05:04.434 --> 05:07.916
He's not answering, 'cause
that-that is not his name.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.135
Jesk.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.617
Hey. Wow.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.577
What a wonderful shock it is
to see you here.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.579
-Yes.
-Do you think maybe

05:18.622 --> 05:21.495
you could let me into
your shelter of automobiles?

05:21.538 --> 05:23.061
What?

05:23.105 --> 05:25.977
Oh, uh, yeah.
Come on in, of course. Yeah.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.241
Well, how have you been?
I-I didn't think

05:29.285 --> 05:30.504
I'd ever see you again.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.462
You will always see me again.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.639
Okay.
Uh, this is where I work.

05:35.683 --> 05:38.381
Hence the...
why I'm working here.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.600
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.993
You are protecting
a vast empire.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.605
Three floors, yeah.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.607
Are the cameras with you?

05:46.650 --> 05:49.087
You don't see the cameras.

05:49.131 --> 05:52.656
Okay. Yeah. Come on in.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.660
Oh, we got your birds,
your rats-- people hate rats.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.053
Then you got your skunks.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.837
We get a lot of calls
for skunks.

05:59.881 --> 06:03.058
I have to get closer
to see if he's in there.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.629
Sounds like an owl to me.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.761
So do you keep your horses
on one of the levels?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.589
Uh, no. There was a Jaguar
in here once.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.983
It's a pretty nice car.Just thought it was pretty cool.

06:15.026 --> 06:18.029
NADJA:
I have met Gregor
in many incarnations.

06:18.073 --> 06:21.816
Soldier, spy,
wax seller, monger,

06:21.859 --> 06:26.342
carpet monger, suitcase monger,

06:26.386 --> 06:28.562
fishmonger, fly monger.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.564
He mongers a lot in his lives.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.654
Your job is so complicated,
Gregor.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.482
-Oh...
-So stimulating.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.484
-No.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.442
A-Again, you know,
it, uh... it's "Jeff."

06:39.486 --> 06:40.704
Shh.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.880
I have crossed oceans of time
to be with you.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.884
-I'm imagining
swimming through time.
-Yes...

06:46.928 --> 06:49.626
-But I have.
-Oh, wow.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.020
Well, I'm gonna get
off work here, in a second.

06:52.063 --> 06:55.589
I just got a little bit moreto do, if you want to hang out.

06:55.632 --> 06:58.896
Oh, it is forbidden,
but ten, 15 minutes?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.724
-Yes, that's great.
-I will see you then.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.857
-Okay, cool.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.164
NADJA:
He's always got a very,
very strong sexual energy

07:06.208 --> 07:09.516
that calls to my sexual energy.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.518
Deeply sexual.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.215
That's Gregor.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.611
So, our roommate, Laszlo,
was knocked unconscious

07:17.654 --> 07:21.615
whilst in bat form by ourneighbor, uh, Phil's girlfriend,

07:21.658 --> 07:25.967
and he's now caged and inside
the animal shelter.

07:26.010 --> 07:30.145
Uh, uh, Laszlo, not Phil,
our neighbor's girlfriend.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.929
Yes.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.627
We must get him out
before daybreak.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.150
Well, and that's the thing

07:35.193 --> 07:37.326
with these nightwalkers
here, isn't it?

07:37.369 --> 07:39.981
You know, a little bit
of sunlight, and poof.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.374
They go up in flames.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.203
-I've never gone poof,
but it's okay.
-Not yet.

07:45.247 --> 07:48.511
The vampires are always like,
: "Ooh! I'm a vampire.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.688
I'm immortal. I'm...
: whatever."

07:51.732 --> 07:55.779
Well, okay. Well, how about
you go be immortal at brunch?

07:58.347 --> 08:00.392
NADJA:
So what is the itinerary
for tonight?

08:00.436 --> 08:02.394
Are you going to punish
your worst enemy?

08:02.438 --> 08:04.396
Embarrass him
in front of his elders?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.573
-Oh, uh...
-Or are we going to destroy

08:06.616 --> 08:08.096
the worst criminals
from your village

08:08.139 --> 08:09.445
and I will help?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.925
Wait, in Staten Island?

08:10.968 --> 08:13.623
How about find some red witchesand cut their feet off?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.625
We could go to the carnival.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.322
I mean, they've got games there.It's pretty dope.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.976
It is like a freak show?

08:19.020 --> 08:20.717
I don't think
you're supposed to say that.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.980
We used to have a freak show
in my village.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.591
We would get given one balloon

08:24.634 --> 08:26.418
between all my brothers
and sisters.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.725
And then we would bite
at each other to get it.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.946
One year, my sister bit
my brother's thigh,

08:31.989 --> 08:34.426
and then we sold the meat
for money.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.648
Hello. C-Can we come in?

08:38.692 --> 08:42.391
Excuse us,
can we come into the shelter?

08:42.434 --> 08:44.611
We're open till 11:00.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.048
-Okay, that's great.
-We see that.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.659
BOTH:
Can we come in?

08:49.703 --> 08:52.532
Yeah, come in.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.449
How's your night been, guys?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.843
-It's none of your business.
-What are you... What?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.802
-How's your night been?
-It's been fine.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.804
Okay, good. Ours has, too.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.850
Isn't this the one
that you ate last week?

09:06.894 --> 09:08.852
I didn't. I wouldn't.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.247
It's locked.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.815
You guys looking
for the bathroom?

09:14.858 --> 09:16.251
I need to do a two.

09:16.294 --> 09:19.384
It's right behind you, man.
That door.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.822
-Wait. Where are you going?

09:21.865 --> 09:23.954
They're not happy
tonight, Bobby.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.304
-Yeah, what's up?
-Oh, I brought in a bat.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.176
-BOBBY: Okay.
-A little fella,
you got to see this guy.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.787
-Look at his face.
-: Yeah.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.094
BOBBY:
This guy looks like
a little English guy.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.835
KAREN:
Yeah, he's a little,
little British chap.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.619
Wait, wait, wait, let me blow
him up there. Look at...

09:36.663 --> 09:38.665
-You see something?
You see something?
-No way.

09:38.708 --> 09:42.451
-That is a bat's erect penis
on that screen.
-Laszlo's.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.410
-Okay.
-We're gonna have to get him
a little rabies shot.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.849
I want you to bring me the
strange bat with the erection.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.242
Wait, hang on a second.
Can you imagine him

09:51.286 --> 09:54.419
with that little British
top hat, like, "Whoo..."

09:54.463 --> 09:55.769
-Like a little explorer.
-I don't think that worked.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.249
-I know.
-Not so hot at hypnotism, huh?

09:58.293 --> 10:01.470
I'm fine at hypnotism; it's justyou can't hypnotize a subject

10:01.513 --> 10:02.863
that doesn't want
to do something

10:02.906 --> 10:04.865
that you want them to do.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.084
If the only time
you can hypnotize someone

10:07.128 --> 10:11.480
is when you have them do
something they want to do,

10:11.523 --> 10:13.308
then it's not really hypnotism,is it?

10:16.137 --> 10:17.921
Wait a minute,
can we help you guys?

10:17.965 --> 10:21.533
Uh, yeah. We're actually lookingfor a lost pet.

10:21.577 --> 10:22.926
-Oh. Okay.
-Okay.

10:22.970 --> 10:26.060
-What kind of pet is it?
-A normal one.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.844
Like, a bat.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.672
Oh, now, bats are illegal.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.500
He said "cat," ma'am.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.023
Well, if you have any sort
of missing animal,

10:33.067 --> 10:34.808
then you just need to fill out
the required paperwork,

10:34.851 --> 10:36.592
and then we'll go have a look
in the back for you.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.985
Fine.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.384
NADJA:
Gregor doesn't know
I am not human

10:46.428 --> 10:49.039
and I cannot do certain things, like eat human food.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.172
Hey. I got us some popcorn.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.304
What is it?

10:53.348 --> 10:55.698
Popcorn?
You've never had popcorn?

10:55.742 --> 10:56.917
-You're gonna love it.
Here, try it.
-Oh.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.614
-Just try one piece.
-Oh, I'm-I'm... No, I...

10:58.658 --> 11:00.747
-No, just come on, just...
-Ooh, wait a minute.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.705
Got it? No, just...
let me put it in your mouth.

11:02.749 --> 11:03.880
-If you just...

11:03.924 --> 11:05.839
If it touches your tongue,
it'll stay.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.188
It sticks to your tongue.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.755
That's what's
kind of fun about it.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.800
There you go. Yeah.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.890
Mm. Hmm.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.727
Mm. That was so nice.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.816
-Yeah.
-Hey, do you want more?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.557
-Oh, no. I'm-I'm okay.
-I got a whole bucket.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.864
No! No. No.

11:30.907 --> 11:34.345
Okay, so the ASBN-119
I need, but...

11:34.389 --> 11:37.784
MA-553 is of no use to me
whatsoever, correct?

11:37.827 --> 11:39.437
Uh, exactly.

11:39.481 --> 11:43.790
: I'm trying
to find an open window.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.053
I think I found one.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.149
Laszlo.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.585
There you are.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.848
I've come to rescue you.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.561
Gregor.
It is your beloved weapon.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.999
You are the master archer.

12:19.042 --> 12:22.045
Yeah. I... I am pretty good
at this in VR.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.135
Behold the great
Gregor the archer.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.658
It's Jeff.

12:26.702 --> 12:29.966
Bring this place to its knees.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.708
Oh, shit.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.189
Imagine it is a horde
of Turkish.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.234
-Horde of what?
-: Kill them.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.283
I kind of suck at this.
I don't know.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.241
What has happened to you?

12:45.286 --> 12:46.896
Stupid.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.942
NANDOR:
We are out, we are out,
we are out.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.944
-Here. Guillermo.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.947
: This is the third
animal shelter I visited.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.687
-We did it?
-NANDOR: Yes, yes, yes.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
Laszlo, you are free now.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.432
-So be free.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.654
-Oh...
-You're welcome.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.178
-Yeah.
-Fucking guy.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.224
Are you guys sure it was him?

13:14.445 --> 13:17.492
Where the fuck am I?

13:17.535 --> 13:20.060
I say!

13:20.103 --> 13:21.757
Release me.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.326
So, what just happened
is that Nandor took a bat

13:25.369 --> 13:27.545
that was being treated here,

13:27.589 --> 13:30.853
and he just rereleased it
into the wild.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.724
Uh, a sick, sick bat.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.857
Do you think I might have
rabies now?

13:34.901 --> 13:38.426
-Possible.
-Not now, Guillermo.

13:38.469 --> 13:41.081
JEFF:
I just don't know how
it's my responsibility to pay

13:41.124 --> 13:42.909
for both Internet and cable.
When you have a roommate,

13:42.952 --> 13:44.693
you're supposed to kind of spliteverything down the middle.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.652
-This is a misery for my ears.
-I know, I just...

13:47.696 --> 13:50.699
-Nice outfit, freak.
- Goth sucks.

13:50.742 --> 13:53.006
You mustn't kill them, please.

13:53.049 --> 13:56.923
-Oh, no, I wasn't gonna
do anything.
-Really? Huh.

13:56.966 --> 14:00.013
Yeah. I... you know, I see a lotof this as a security guard,

14:00.056 --> 14:01.405
and the best way
to handle this...

14:03.494 --> 14:05.061
RECORDED VOICE:
Congratulations.
We have a winner!

14:05.105 --> 14:07.803
-What happened?-He was playing the game wrong.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.503
I cannot believe how boring
Gregor has become.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.549
In every other past life,
he was so exhilarating.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.116
Such a maverick.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.900
You know,
when he was a washer woman,

14:17.944 --> 14:21.121
he would pour dirty old
mop juice all over my body

14:21.164 --> 14:23.123
and rub it into me
while he ravished me.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.299
-When he was a wild horse...

14:25.342 --> 14:27.997
I rode him naked all throughout the countryside.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.956
But this version of Gregor?

14:29.999 --> 14:32.175
It is a boring disgrace.

14:32.219 --> 14:36.092
And you know what? It's becausethey named him Jeps. Jeff.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.268
Wow, you were really good
at ring toss.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.314
-I had so much fun tonight.
-I cannot take this.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.924
I cannot take how boring
you have become.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.274
How are you supposed
to be a strong,

14:44.318 --> 14:46.755
thrilling,
powerful warrior and lover

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
with a name like Jeff?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.193
It is like a weak ejaculation.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.152
-Okay.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.631
-Jeff.
-Okay, all right, all right.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.591
You know what?
You're being really rude to me

14:56.634 --> 14:59.768
and my Uncle Jeff,
but also Grandpa Jeff,

14:59.811 --> 15:02.205
-and that's where
I draw the line.
-Go back.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.815
Remember.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.861
Remember who you are.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.819
Ah...

15:12.563 --> 15:16.437
I am standing
on the crest of a hill.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.135
Atop the Carpathian Mountains.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.225
-I am victorious from battle.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.750
But I am punctured...

15:25.794 --> 15:28.188
by many arrow.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.233
Yet I survive.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.193
I must survive...

15:33.236 --> 15:35.978
to see my lover.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.588
Nadja.

15:37.632 --> 15:41.070
Love... will get me through.

15:41.114 --> 15:44.769
Desire... will fuel my journey.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.249
Oh, Gregor...

15:46.293 --> 15:48.773
-it is you.
-Hark.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.211
A rider approaches.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.430
He is wielding a sword.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.258
It comes towards me,

15:55.302 --> 15:57.130
-aiming directly for my hea...

15:57.173 --> 15:59.175
Oh, next life.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.962
Be down in a minute, sire.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.877
This mop...

16:05.921 --> 16:09.794
It is as full of water
as I am desire.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.013
-I want to, but I mustn't.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.233
-No, you can.
-No, he will hear.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.061
Just one little kiss
with our lips.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.237
-He will be so angry.-Just stick our mouths together.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.458
- Oh, no, sir,
not my head.
-Next!

16:33.296 --> 16:36.256
Silence, my four-legged friends.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.259
I sense you are angry tonight.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.261
And with good reason.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.045
For we have been imprisoned.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.047
-Yes, without trial.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.703
Now is the time
to hoist our oars

16:48.746 --> 16:51.314
and row towards freedom.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.055
Agreed?

16:53.099 --> 16:55.101
-Thank you.

16:55.144 --> 16:57.233
Now, I'm assuming

16:57.277 --> 17:01.455
that there is a cat
in the cage to my right.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.500
-Excellent.

17:03.544 --> 17:07.200
You will succumb
to my dark power,

17:07.243 --> 17:09.854
and you will undo your latch

17:09.898 --> 17:12.292
-and free me.

17:12.335 --> 17:15.164
Loosen your latch and free me.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.905
-KAREN: All right...
-Succumb... Shit.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.212
-Bat.
-Here you go.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.128
Over here.
You know your spot.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.912
There you go.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.262
Home, sweet home.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.090
Be good.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.136
All right. Night, fellas.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.227
Woof, woof.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.099
-Nandor? Is that you?
-Yes.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.146
I turned myself into a dog
to come and rescue you.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.105
Hang on a second--
you turned yourself into a dog

17:43.149 --> 17:46.195
-in a place that imprisons dogs?-I just thought I'd be

17:46.239 --> 17:47.457
a bit creative
and come and rescue you.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.372
You don't want me to rescue you,I can go again.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.157
And tell me how you do that.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.375
You're locked in a fucking cage.

17:52.419 --> 17:53.985
Oh...

17:54.029 --> 17:56.379
What's Nadja gonna say?
Where is she?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.164
Uh...

17:59.600 --> 18:02.168
-OFFICER: No! Stop!

18:02.211 --> 18:05.388
-Stop!
-My Gregor, yes!

18:05.432 --> 18:07.521
OFFICER:
Come on!

18:10.524 --> 18:12.221
Hey, not-a-cop.

18:16.312 --> 18:19.141
Whoa, whoa. Holy shit.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.860
-Yes.
-We have defeated time itself.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.297
We have been drawn together.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.386
-Let's make love right now.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.431
-Right here?
-Yeah, here.

18:48.475 --> 18:51.173
Right here on the dirty ground
in this filthy parking lot.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.219
Oh, I was hoping
you would say that.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.308
-Yeah.
-Oh...

18:55.351 --> 18:57.788
Oh, God. You want to get that?
Do you need to get that?

18:57.832 --> 18:59.355
Hello?

18:59.399 --> 19:01.270
Hello, Guillermo.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.446
Yeah, I see.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.318
He did what?

19:05.361 --> 19:07.842
I'm... Okay, yeah. Yeah.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.626
Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye-bye.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.411
Bye. Okay. Yeah.

19:11.454 --> 19:12.977
Sorry, I have to leave.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.457
-Stay with me.
-I know.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.459
Let's make animalistic,
freaky sex right now.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.809
No, but somebody else needs me

19:18.853 --> 19:22.465
in a much less erotic way,but, you know, it is what it is.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.902
But I've died for you, Nadja.
I've seen it.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.991
These visions are enough
to drive a man to madness.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.037
Oh, it was only one time
you died for me.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.343
The other times
were just accidents.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.040
A few hours ago,
my life was normal,

19:32.083 --> 19:34.085
and now everything
I thought I knew was real

19:34.129 --> 19:35.652
has turned out to be
an illusion.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.437
I'm married with a husband.
Farewell.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.309
-No, no, Nadja. Nadja. Nadja!

19:43.486 --> 19:45.445
Oh, my God!

19:45.488 --> 19:48.056
- Nadja?!

19:48.099 --> 19:50.493
COLIN:
And, like, I've also
noticed that some dogs

19:50.537 --> 19:51.886
are really, really big,
and other dogs

19:51.929 --> 19:53.366
-are really small...

19:53.409 --> 19:54.367
Oh, thank God.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.326
-Sorry. Thank goodness.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.241
-Laszlo and Nandor
are in cages inside.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.722
-Please come in, ma'am.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.333
Thank you.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.030
What is the code for your door?

20:06.074 --> 20:08.076
1-2-3-4-5.

20:08.119 --> 20:11.035
-That's the code for the door?
-Uh-huh.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.734
Humans, I can't...

20:15.083 --> 20:16.693
Yay, it's Nadja.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.521
Hello, my darling.
What are you doing here?

20:18.565 --> 20:21.176
-I've come to help you
out of the cage.
-Absolutely no need.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.134
-Mr. Cat next door...

20:23.178 --> 20:25.920
...I was in the process
of hypnotizing him.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.487
I was moments away
from escaping.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.271
I don't know why
you bothered coming.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.318
Sh-Shit.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.710
I've got to free
my fellow inmates.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.277
I made a gentleman's promise.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.757

-et cetera, et cetera.
-JEFF :
That's all the truth!

20:41.805 --> 20:44.286
You can ask my ex--
we were together ages ago.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.332
She turned into a pile of rats.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.334
Okay, buddy. I'll just ask
the pile of rats.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.205
I am Gregor!

20:50.249 --> 20:52.729
Victor of many battles.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.428
I am cleaning lady!

20:58.039 --> 21:00.911
-Run and be free, my comrade.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.435
-What the fuck?

21:07.353 --> 21:09.224
Still no thank-you?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.792
Release your claws,
you ungrateful bastards.
