WEBVTT

01:02.250 --> 01:05.042
I remember when I first came here.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.750
All I'd been told
was that Forte dei Marmi

01:07.875 --> 01:09.833
was an elegant seaside resort.

01:10.417 --> 01:11.958
In fact,

01:12.167 --> 01:14.625
it was like stepping into a postcard,

01:15.125 --> 01:18.500
where everything seemed staged.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.000
The blue and white cabanas

01:28.125 --> 01:30.083
of the private beaches.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.708
The raked sand.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.333
The sound of laughter
carried by the breeze.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.583
And I was struck
by a sense of timelessness...

01:46.333 --> 01:49.875
Bicycles drifting silently along
the promenade at sunset.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.583
A perfect place
for a summer vacation, a refuge.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.083
But even in Forte dei Marmi,

01:58.208 --> 02:00.917
the days grow shorter
and the nights longer.

02:07.292 --> 02:08.958
The Apuane Alps,

02:09.708 --> 02:11.625
exchange their white marbled peaks

02:11.750 --> 02:14.208
for a cloak of frozen snow.

02:15.625 --> 02:17.542
Darkness devours the light

02:18.000 --> 02:19.708
and fear finds us.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.833
Even in Forte dei Marmi,

02:24.208 --> 02:26.542
we have learned to lock our doors.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.250
This sunny, serene little town

02:32.333 --> 02:34.208
now appears empty.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.750
As if it were... evacuated.

02:39.667 --> 02:42.667
This is a winter story.

03:35.708 --> 03:36.750
Help!

03:50.542 --> 03:51.625
Help!

04:07.958 --> 04:09.500
Help!

04:34.167 --> 04:35.750
What's wrong?

04:35.875 --> 04:39.083
It's the Clementis. They're saying
they'll only talk to you.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.167
From Barbados.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.542
Have they really
got nothing better to do?

04:44.792 --> 04:48.750
Something on their gate camera
freaked them out.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.875
I was hoping to get
a few hours sleep tonight.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.708
You said if it was a Premium Client...
I should call you.

04:57.417 --> 05:00.250
You did the right thing.
Good night, Emma.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.375
- Sleep.
- I'll try.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.875
Mr. Clementi.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.250
- Are you at the house?
- Yes. I'm here.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.917
And? Is everything alright?

05:46.542 --> 05:49.167
The perimeter cameras
are all clear.

05:49.375 --> 05:52.083
- Yeah, but...
- No sign of any forced entry.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.625
Look, it was really distressing,
the girl's face.

05:55.958 --> 05:59.208
It just made us wonder
who else might be lurking around...

05:59.625 --> 06:03.792
It's like an invasion these days,
you can't be too sure, you know?

06:03.917 --> 06:06.375
Not everything is immigrants.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.500
- Please, check everything yourself.
- Alright, I'll check.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.042
Thank you, Mr. Santini.

06:12.458 --> 06:14.833
OK. A good day to you.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.250
Actually,
it's the middle of the night here.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.000
But thank you.

06:22.125 --> 06:24.625
- Goodbye, Santini.
- Goodbye.

06:41.292 --> 06:43.292
Oh, for fuck's sake.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.125
What the fuck's he doing!

06:52.917 --> 06:55.208
- Good evening, Mr. Santini.
- Yeah,

06:55.417 --> 06:58.583
I've got a likely drunk driver
on Via Volta and Via Carrara.

06:58.708 --> 07:01.792
License plate PI55388.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.750
We'll send someone right away.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.583
Thank you... Thank you.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.333
Never mind.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.042
You sure?

07:23.250 --> 07:25.417
Yeah, yeah, good night.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.958
- What's your problem, asshole?
- Dario...

07:30.333 --> 07:31.958
Do I know you?

07:32.167 --> 07:33.708
I know your mother.

07:35.125 --> 07:38.500
Come on, get in, you can't drive like
that. I'll take you home. Come on.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.833
- Easy! Easy!
- Shit.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.042
Just tell me what happened.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.333
I'll deal with you later.

08:01.542 --> 08:03.083
No, you won't.

08:05.208 --> 08:08.250
He was driving drunk.
He's lucky I found him.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.458
I worry that it's more than alcohol.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.125
So what were you up to?

08:19.292 --> 08:21.208
Some billionaire lost his cat?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.667
The car's on Via Volta.

08:38.792 --> 08:40.417
Thank you, Roberto.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.167
- Good night.
- Yes...

08:42.292 --> 08:44.000
It's good to see you.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.167
Dario? Dario, open up!

09:12.500 --> 09:14.250
Dario, open up!

10:03.375 --> 10:05.000
Good morning.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.875
Who are you trying to kid?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.208
Even Angela knows
you weren't here last night.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.375
She got home at three in the morning!

10:13.250 --> 10:15.542
Whatever happened to house rules?

10:16.083 --> 10:17.917
I'm just curious...

10:18.875 --> 10:21.458
Your clients, the anthropologists,

10:22.167 --> 10:24.500
do they know
you're sleeping in their house

10:24.625 --> 10:26.083
when you're not sleeping?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.500
They're in South Africa,
they don't get back for a while.

10:29.292 --> 10:31.125
Where was she?

10:31.375 --> 10:33.250
Ask her yourself.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.042
Why don't you track her?

10:35.167 --> 10:38.250
I'm not installing that shit
on her phone.

10:38.375 --> 10:40.208
- Let her have her own life.
- Sure!

10:40.333 --> 10:43.625
Listen, you're on the front page
this morning with Pilati.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.375
PILATI BACKS CLAUDIA RAFFAELLI.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.458
Fantastic! I'd forgotten.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.292
You pleased?

10:49.417 --> 10:50.708
Good morning.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.125
And good morning to you, too, Miss.

10:54.292 --> 10:56.000
We are fine, thank you for asking.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.375
You got something to say...?

10:57.583 --> 10:59.208
Angela, you broke curfew.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.083
How many times have I told you that you
can't be late on a school night?

11:02.208 --> 11:03.667
I already told Mom.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.083
I was doing homework with Ginevra.
We fell asleep.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.833
Anyway, where were you?

11:09.042 --> 11:10.375
I'm late. Gotta go.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.542
No texting on your bike!

11:13.792 --> 11:16.083
- I know, you always tell me.
- Your mother made front page news...

11:17.375 --> 11:19.750
Angela, did you see Mom
on the front page?

11:20.167 --> 11:21.917
She didn't hear me...

11:22.042 --> 11:24.417
And if she had...?
Do you think she cares?

11:25.458 --> 11:28.375
Here comes somebody who does care.

11:28.750 --> 11:31.667
Crap. Matteo. He's early.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.792
This is not a good look for us.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.167
Just take the damn sleeping tablets.
I feel like I'm married to a vampire.

11:40.292 --> 11:42.250
The tablets made me feel crazy.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.042
- And this is a better crazy?
- Good morning.

11:45.250 --> 11:48.500
- Matteo!
- Well done on the front page.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.167
- Thanks! Great, wasn't it!
- Yes, I saw it.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.458
Here's the new cut.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.250
You're going to love it.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.083
VERSION 5
FOR A SAFER TOWN

11:57.208 --> 11:58.792
New music.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.250
Sea...yes.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.667
Perfect!

12:03.875 --> 12:05.542
The whole panorama...

12:05.667 --> 12:08.125
- With the Forte.
- This is the painful part.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.083
- I'm tense.
- That's not true!

12:10.208 --> 12:11.958
In a world under threat,

12:12.083 --> 12:14.375
a vote for me
is a vote for a safer future!

12:17.292 --> 12:19.333
You look great.

12:23.125 --> 12:23.708
FOR A SAFER TOWN

12:24.583 --> 12:26.833
The Pilati fundraiser...

12:26.958 --> 12:29.417
- our head count now includes...
- Who's that?

12:29.667 --> 12:32.417
Marcello... Ferrario.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.083
- Ferrario the billionaire?
- Yup.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.208
This is gigantic, fantastic stuff.

12:36.417 --> 12:39.458
I know. Ferrario's personal security
team already left a message.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.208
Is this something for Mr. Santini?

12:43.083 --> 12:45.667
- No. I'm handling it.
- Good.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.458
Let's go!

13:26.792 --> 13:29.042
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.333
Still here?

13:31.458 --> 13:33.500
I need to show you something.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.833
What?

13:41.708 --> 13:45.958
Last night's recording
on the Clementi camera.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.292
Fuck!

13:50.917 --> 13:54.583
- What clients have we further east?
- Do they have 'history function'?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.292
Yes.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.625
Everybody has 'history function'
on their perimeter cameras

14:01.333 --> 14:03.458
whether they pay for it or not.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.000
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.917
What's with the coat? You cold?

14:18.167 --> 14:20.500
I hate winter, I hate it!

14:23.500 --> 14:26.333
- Damn, we're good.
- The best.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.167
Look... look.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.167
There.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.625
- Who are they arresting?
- I don't know.

14:44.958 --> 14:46.625
Fuck.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.292
What is it?

14:50.083 --> 14:52.917
That's Walter
and his daughter, Maria.

14:53.958 --> 14:55.292
Spezi.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.375
He was my technician.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.458
The best in the business.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.583
Who's that doing the recording?

15:28.250 --> 15:31.125
CREATIVE WRITING CLASS

15:40.833 --> 15:44.458
OK! Before bestowing upon you
my pearls of wisdom...

15:45.375 --> 15:47.292
I've got some bad news for you.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.458
Maria Spezi,
your classmate, is in hospital.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.250
Oh, God. What happened?

15:52.375 --> 15:54.208
She tripped on one
of her father's empty bottles.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.375
Guys, please!

15:57.333 --> 16:01.292
Anyway, Maria is OK, nothing serious!
And now please let's get to work.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.250
Right...

16:04.375 --> 16:06.375
Angela. Your essay. 'Bone of Contention'.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.500
-Are you ready to share?
- Sorry. I need another week for research

16:09.625 --> 16:12.000
I just have to wrestle my parents
into the same room

16:12.125 --> 16:14.917
- for more than ten seconds.
- Prof...

16:19.083 --> 16:21.917
Darling, I don't know
how to get it through to you!

16:23.417 --> 16:25.667
I'm not your professor.

16:25.833 --> 16:29.500
Geography, history,
learn all that from the others.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.375
I'm here to help you find
the truth without censorship.

16:34.958 --> 16:38.375
Not the crap you see on TV,
or your social networks!

16:40.000 --> 16:41.500
I'm here...

16:43.625 --> 16:47.917
to teach you how to make
life interesting on the page,

16:49.583 --> 16:51.792
Admittedly with an eye
on the road to agents,

16:51.917 --> 16:53.667
publishers and editors...

16:54.625 --> 16:56.083
Cellphones.

16:57.167 --> 16:58.750
Ashes to ashes.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.333
Dust to dust.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.458
We commit these phones

17:02.583 --> 17:04.875
to their temporary place of rest.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.833
I remind you!
Nothing will leave this sacred place.

17:08.667 --> 17:11.458
So, please, no judgment,

17:11.667 --> 17:13.125
honesty all the way.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.750
Ginevra! Go! I'm all yours.

17:21.417 --> 17:24.375
Provisional title: 'Busted!'

17:26.542 --> 17:29.000
"The first time I met
my father's business partner,

17:29.875 --> 17:31.333
Volmaro,

17:32.125 --> 17:33.750
I was six.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.583
Ten years later, I was his Lolita.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.042
And he was my revenge
against my parents.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.375
I was insatiable."

17:44.500 --> 17:45.708
Mom...

17:45.833 --> 17:46.875
"Insatiable.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.000
But it wasn't about fucking.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.375
It was about fucking
with people's heads..."

18:03.167 --> 18:05.417
Excuse me, Angela?
Any other noises you want to make?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.750
I'm sorry. I mean...

18:07.958 --> 18:11.792
does anybody else think that the
narrator's point of view lacks... empathy?

18:11.917 --> 18:14.417
Sir, this is my trauma.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.167
There's no way
I'm going to take this kind of abuse.

18:17.292 --> 18:19.042
No, you're right.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.625
You're not. Ginevra, continue.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.708
"We couldn't get away with it
all the time..."

18:37.625 --> 18:40.292
- Hey, Enzo.
- Security Man!

18:40.542 --> 18:42.042
- Everything OK?
- Fine, you?

18:42.167 --> 18:44.208
Fine! Listen...

18:45.708 --> 18:47.875
- The guy filming, who is he?
- Domenichetti.

18:48.708 --> 18:51.125
Come on, the case is closed.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.917
He's guilty, he admitted it...
look at the file.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.958
Spezi's neighbor, Rizieri,

19:04.250 --> 19:06.875
reported Spezi being drunk
right before the incident.

19:08.292 --> 19:09.917
He feared for the daughter's safety.

19:10.042 --> 19:13.375
Said there'd been a pretty big row
between them earlier in the evening.

19:18.292 --> 19:20.625
"It's a steep climb, you know,
back to normal."

19:21.292 --> 19:22.750
Climb?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.958
Some people can't make it.

19:38.542 --> 19:39.875
Maria...

19:40.625 --> 19:43.458
On a scale of one to ten
how bad is the pain?

19:43.958 --> 19:45.417
Eleven.

19:46.042 --> 19:48.292
Let's start very slowly.

19:48.792 --> 19:51.333
Can you move your fingers?
Like so.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.125
Good girl, the other way?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.667
I need to check the range
of motion in your shoulder.

20:03.208 --> 20:06.583
Give your whole arm over to me.
Trust me with it.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.792
Let's try again! Let go...

20:16.125 --> 20:17.875
Right, Maria...

20:18.208 --> 20:20.083
Your arm was dislocated.

20:20.208 --> 20:23.542
If you carry on like this, you risk
your shoulder becoming frozen!

20:24.500 --> 20:26.792
The more you do now,
the better your future.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.833
Go on... eat the forbidden fruit.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.125
- Already did.
- Again.

21:26.458 --> 21:29.750
Sweetheart, you need to find
someone your own age.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.958
You're... insatiable.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.917
Insatiable!

21:36.375 --> 21:38.667
Don't you dare compare me to Ginevra.

21:38.875 --> 21:41.042
What we have is real.

21:41.583 --> 21:42.875
I need to work.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.667
What's wrong?

21:54.750 --> 21:56.875
Sunday evening
you came home really late

21:57.000 --> 21:59.708
and didn't let me stay. Why?

22:00.458 --> 22:03.583
You're sounding like my ex-wife
who's 'ex' for a reason, by the way.

22:04.542 --> 22:07.833
You know
I don't want to bother you.

22:07.958 --> 22:11.333
There's something you're not telling me.
I just want to know, to help...

22:11.458 --> 22:12.917
Listen...

22:14.125 --> 22:16.708
The delivery date for the book
the pressure, it's driving me crazy.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.875
I've just got to finish it.
And I can't if you stay.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Just give me a week
and then I'll be all yours.

22:23.458 --> 22:26.167
But now, go, please.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.625
You still haven't answered my question.
Where were you on Sunday?

22:36.083 --> 22:38.625
- I was driving around.
- Doing what?

22:39.417 --> 22:40.958
Looking for something.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.667
- For what?
- I don't know. Something. My muse!

22:56.750 --> 22:59.667
Well, that bitch, Ginevra,
just posted a photo of you.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.167
Any good?

23:10.500 --> 23:13.250
Very cool.
In the school courtyard.

23:13.583 --> 23:14.583
Good.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.208
They'd all die if they knew.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.375
They must never know, Angela.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.792
Never ever!

23:31.375 --> 23:33.542
You're hurting me...

23:39.708 --> 23:40.917
What's up?

23:41.042 --> 23:43.000
I'm synching the audio
from Domenichetti's cell.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.667
It's my fault!

23:45.375 --> 23:47.000
It's my fault!

24:00.417 --> 24:02.833
You know, as tragic
as all this Spezi business is...

24:02.958 --> 24:05.833
The timing couldn't be better
for you, could it?

24:09.250 --> 24:11.333
That's a low blow...

24:13.417 --> 24:15.750
You look great, by the way.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.708
Is that for the event
or for Pilati?

24:26.958 --> 24:30.125
If I weren't married,
I might be attracted to him.

24:30.250 --> 24:33.750
No, no. You are married,
and you're still attracted to him.

24:35.292 --> 24:37.000
I get it!

24:37.333 --> 24:39.292
He's the opposite of me.

24:39.417 --> 24:43.125
He's all the things I'll never be.
Rich. Elegant.

24:44.292 --> 24:45.500
Rich...

24:45.750 --> 24:47.917
Maybe in another universe...

24:48.792 --> 24:50.250
Here we are!

24:53.125 --> 24:55.542
Try and look happy tonight,
Roberto.

24:55.667 --> 24:58.625
And for God's sake
don't shake Pilati's hand.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.625
What's all that about?
The whole 'not touching' thing?

25:01.833 --> 25:05.417
I guess if you're that rich, you can
afford to have any phobia you want.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.958
Still, kind of a relationship
deal-breaker, don't you think?

25:09.083 --> 25:10.458
Not necessarily.

25:16.667 --> 25:19.500
- Boss...
- Good evening, Santini.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.167
- Good evening, Claudia.
- Good evening.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.292
Looking sharp tonight, Carlo.

25:27.042 --> 25:29.000
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.917
- Curzio...
- Claudia...

25:32.042 --> 25:33.708
Impressive turnout.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.083
Some pretty deep pockets
in this room.

25:36.250 --> 25:38.542
- Thanks to you.
- Thanks to you.

25:39.375 --> 25:43.083
Roberto, look at your wife,
this evening, in this light,

25:43.208 --> 25:46.083
a Medici Venus...

25:46.542 --> 25:48.500
Feminine on the outside,

25:48.708 --> 25:52.250
firm as marble on the inside.
You are a lucky man, Roberto.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.583
I've always thought so, yes.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.292
- Speeches in five.
- Of course.

25:57.417 --> 25:59.250
Billionaire-Ferrario is already here.

25:59.375 --> 26:02.292
Matteo. Please.
Just 'Ferrario is already here'.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.375
- I'll have a whisky.
- Roberto!

26:04.500 --> 26:07.667
May I introduce you
to my new American client, Camille.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.542
She just bought on Via Gorizia.

26:10.667 --> 26:13.125
Just in time,
if the rumors are true.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.542
- What rumors this time?
- Once Marcello Ferrario buys,

26:17.667 --> 26:20.958
we're looking
at a 20% house price bump.

26:21.750 --> 26:25.542
You know Ferrario's not supposed
to be here tonight, right?

26:25.917 --> 26:28.875
No cameras allowed.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.542
God forbid a high profile 'Liberal'
should be seen to be supporting

26:32.750 --> 26:34.500
a 'Conservative' candidate...

26:36.208 --> 26:38.167
Are we boring you?

26:44.458 --> 26:45.542
Yes.

26:48.458 --> 26:49.583
No, I'm kidding.

26:50.458 --> 26:53.583
Sorry. I'm dealing
with horrendous insomnia.

26:53.917 --> 26:57.375
Oh, you poor thing,
are you taking anything?

26:58.083 --> 27:02.083
Because if you're not careful,
you can start hallucinating.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.792
Yes, I know.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.958
Well, for starters, no alcohol.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.792
Everybody! Your attention, please!

27:24.417 --> 27:27.667
I know that for many of you
Forte dei Marmi

27:28.083 --> 27:31.500
is a second home.
Or third. Or fourth.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.250
But it's a place

27:37.125 --> 27:39.458
we all cherish.

27:40.458 --> 27:43.708
And let nobody tell us
we haven't earned it.

27:45.583 --> 27:47.208
Ladies and gentleman,

27:47.792 --> 27:49.750
I give you our next mayor,

27:49.875 --> 27:52.583
our first woman mayor,

27:52.708 --> 27:56.000
and, I guarantee,
our best mayor ever!

27:57.750 --> 28:01.542
Claudia Raffaelli.
For a safer Forte dei Marmi!

28:02.917 --> 28:04.792
Thank you.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.292
I was born in Forte dei Marmi.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.833
I grew up here.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.125
My daughter grew up here.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.167
And I intend on growing old here.

28:17.083 --> 28:20.208
As a child, I wandered free.

28:20.708 --> 28:22.625
Every street was safe.

28:23.083 --> 28:27.083
Every front door was unlocked.
No-one had any reason to be afraid.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.125
Imagine.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.792
There's a reason
why we call them 'invaders'...

28:33.750 --> 28:35.125
'undesirables'.

28:37.625 --> 28:40.042
And let us not forget

28:40.208 --> 28:43.542
how much we owe to our
Chief of Police, Mori,

28:45.375 --> 28:48.917
for solving the recent spate
of burglaries,

28:49.292 --> 28:50.917
now finally under control.

28:51.125 --> 28:52.500
You know,

28:52.708 --> 28:54.625
this dramatic incident

28:54.917 --> 28:56.875
that just occurred

28:57.333 --> 28:59.292
in the early hours of Sunday morning,

28:59.417 --> 29:01.125
involving that poor girl,

29:01.625 --> 29:03.583
is a case in point.

29:04.250 --> 29:07.667
She was attacked...
by someone she trusted.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.125
You're not coming in?

29:17.625 --> 29:20.000
You don't need me
prowling around all night.

29:24.042 --> 29:26.458
Everybody fell in love with you tonight.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.792
Claudia. What's wrong?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.083
The bitch changed her story.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.208
She's saying it happened at Pilati's.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.333
What?

30:21.542 --> 30:24.958
Don't worry. Pilati wasn't there.
He was in Milan. The house was empty.

30:25.083 --> 30:28.458
But that's not the point.
It's the optics.

30:28.958 --> 30:30.458
You have to fix this, Roberto.

30:30.708 --> 30:33.125
As soon as possible, understand?

30:33.792 --> 30:35.500
Alright.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.375
Is that too tight?

30:45.583 --> 30:47.917
Let me loosen it a little...

30:48.958 --> 30:51.458
Show me your hand... there.

30:52.125 --> 30:55.292
Roberto, please tell your wife
to calm down.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.875
The girl is obviously
protecting her father.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.292
The anaesthetic wore off,
she realized he was locked up,

31:00.417 --> 31:02.083
she panicked.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.500
Now she's claiming
it happened at Pilati's place,

31:04.625 --> 31:07.083
that there was a lot of drinking
and some boy.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.833
A boy?

31:08.958 --> 31:11.292
A boy whose name she conveniently forgot.
It's bullshit.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.333
An obvious fabrication.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.083
Look, Spezi's been here before,

31:18.333 --> 31:21.125
drunk and disorderly,
resisting arrest.

31:21.250 --> 31:24.417
He confessed at the scene
of the crime, let's not forget that.

31:24.750 --> 31:27.833
- Any drugs involved?
- Nothing in toxicology,

31:27.958 --> 31:30.625
beyond the painkiller
the hospital gave her.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.792
- So where's Spezi?
- We're releasing him.

31:37.292 --> 31:40.167
I know. What can I do?
She refuses to press charges.

31:40.917 --> 31:44.125
Don't worry, we're sending her home
with a social worker.

31:54.542 --> 31:57.417
- Sorry. Alessandro, can you take over?
- Sure.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.667
I just lost a bet with myself.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.208
What do you mean?

32:03.333 --> 32:05.833
I was sure you would take another
seven years to call me.

32:06.250 --> 32:09.292
Did you pick up Dario's car?

32:09.542 --> 32:11.250
Yes!

32:12.083 --> 32:15.042
I need to talk to him.
Where does he work?

32:15.542 --> 32:17.583
If my son has done something terrible,
you'd tell me, right?

32:17.708 --> 32:19.417
Yes, I would tell you.

32:19.542 --> 32:22.042
He works at Gilda's Beach.
The restaurant.

32:22.417 --> 32:24.708
Alright. Then maybe...

32:24.833 --> 32:27.250
- we'll meet again. Bye.
- OK.

32:32.625 --> 32:35.500
Dario? He stopped showing up about
six weeks ago.

32:35.625 --> 32:37.250
Did he say why?

32:38.375 --> 32:40.417
We're getting on fine without him.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.292
Thanks.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.458
If you find that dickhead Dario,

32:50.583 --> 32:52.583
tell him to call me, Letizia.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.958
So I can ignore him.

34:08.625 --> 34:10.542
Maria, tell me where you sleep.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.375
Upstairs.

34:13.875 --> 34:16.292
And, Mr. Spezi, where do you sleep?

34:17.917 --> 34:19.417
Down here.

34:22.375 --> 34:25.833
And are you in regular employment,
enough to meet your needs?

34:28.792 --> 34:30.125
Yes.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.833
You sure you're alright?

34:36.542 --> 34:39.125
Why does everybody keep
asking me that?

34:39.750 --> 34:41.375
I'm fine here.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.458
Alright.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.667
I'm leaving now.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.542
This is for her pain.

34:49.667 --> 34:53.417
Please make sure
she takes it as prescribed.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.375
Goodbye, Maria.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.333
Maria, I'm sorry, if you want
we can talk about what happened.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.250
I don't want to talk about it.

35:09.042 --> 35:12.208
Don't worry.
I told them it wasn't you.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.917
Maria... listen... Maria...

35:19.250 --> 35:21.542
I'm going to clear my name
of everything, you'll see.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.750
They can't keep treating us like this!

35:24.083 --> 35:26.375
They can't keep treating us like this.

36:19.375 --> 36:21.583
You fell asleep.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.500
I can help you.

36:24.875 --> 36:27.542
- Mr. Santini? Everything OK here?
- He fell asleep.

36:30.125 --> 36:32.500
Light's green, sir.
You get to where you need to be.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.792
Roberto. The sleeplessness...

36:35.292 --> 36:38.917
The night. The dark.
It's a new perspective.

36:39.375 --> 36:42.125
- Embrace it.
- Fuck off, witch!

37:12.292 --> 37:15.958
It's the one rotten tooth
in the smile that is Forte dei Marmi.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.542
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this moment.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.333
I love it.

37:21.708 --> 37:22.833
Wonderful!

37:22.958 --> 37:24.792
- Can we go inside?
- Sure.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.042
For the outside,

37:28.250 --> 37:30.083
discreet perimeter cameras,
all thermal.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.708
so no light pollution,
motion-activated, obviously.

37:33.292 --> 37:37.083
All with facial recognition
and discernment

37:37.292 --> 37:40.583
be it friends, relatives,

37:41.042 --> 37:42.500
or 'undesirables'.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.708
Basically, the answer
to all your questions is 'yes'.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.250
Today everything's possible.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.292
Look, nobody was raped.
Nobody died.

37:52.667 --> 37:56.208
No bones were broken.
All hymens remained intact.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.458
It was a domestic dispute.
Nothing more.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.417
You're in the right business,
Mr. Santini.

38:03.833 --> 38:05.583
Eh, yes, my dear Marcello.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.792
We're targets, men like us.

38:07.917 --> 38:09.792
The world has changed.

38:09.917 --> 38:12.042
We can no longer afford

38:12.167 --> 38:15.250
to be seduced by the needy.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.583
Marcello, I don't want a fortress,

38:19.208 --> 38:21.958
- I love how central the villa is.
- Yeah, there's everything here.

38:22.625 --> 38:25.083
She just wants to be within walking
distance of Prada and Gucci.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.583
Shall we go?

38:26.708 --> 38:28.917
The house is beautiful, it's wonderful.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.583
Read me some of your book.

39:07.792 --> 39:09.417
Not ready.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.417
This time, I want us to come together.
At the exact same moment.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.208
I don't want to come until you do.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.333
For fuck's sake, Angela...

39:35.500 --> 39:37.417
You don't seem to want me
as much as you did...

39:37.542 --> 39:39.667
I thought it might help...

39:41.583 --> 39:43.708
What the fuck are you going on about,
Angela,

39:44.375 --> 39:46.417
I'm 40 not 70!

39:49.667 --> 39:51.833
And you really think
that's the problem.

39:52.708 --> 39:54.833
You really think a blue pill
is going to solve everything?

39:56.292 --> 39:58.917
Jesus Christ, Angela,
you really are a little girl.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.792
- It's such a shame.
- What?

40:11.417 --> 40:14.292
That these are the people
you need for your campaign.

40:15.542 --> 40:18.042
- Come on, it's all part of the game.
- Game?

40:18.333 --> 40:19.417
Yes.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.167
'All hymens remained intact'?
Beautiful!

40:22.292 --> 40:25.375
- How the fuck is it possible?
- What?

40:25.500 --> 40:27.417
To not give a fuck
what happened to Maria.

40:27.542 --> 40:29.542
It was a joke.

40:30.708 --> 40:32.875
- A joke?
- Yes, a joke!

40:33.000 --> 40:35.042
That girl is scarred for life!

40:35.958 --> 40:39.167
I just can't help wondering how we'd
feel if Angela had been the victim.

40:39.333 --> 40:43.333
But she wasn't. And I'm trying
to make sure she never will be.

40:43.792 --> 40:46.000
- Not her, not any other girl!
- Yeah, yeah...

40:46.167 --> 40:48.333
Yeah, yeah...

40:51.375 --> 40:55.625
Roberto, I have to ask you.
Are you seeing Elena again?

40:57.208 --> 40:58.500
No!

41:03.208 --> 41:05.667
No... so these...

41:06.917 --> 41:09.750
- Then what are these blue pills?
- They're not mine.

41:09.875 --> 41:11.417
- They're not yours?
- They're not mine.

41:11.542 --> 41:14.667
Yes, they are. Masculus V.

41:15.083 --> 41:17.625
Claudia, I'm 40, not 70!

41:17.833 --> 41:20.792
- I don't need them.
- Sure! You're too much of a stud.

41:20.917 --> 41:23.542
- Where did you find them?
- At home, where did I find them?

41:23.750 --> 41:26.625
Have a look,
there'll be a receipt or a bill...

41:26.917 --> 41:29.792
- Let me check my bag...
- It'll be an online order.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.333
There. Found it!

41:32.708 --> 41:35.000
You hoped I wouldn't find it, but...

41:36.708 --> 41:38.042
they're Angela's.

41:40.833 --> 41:42.750
What does she need them for?

41:43.625 --> 41:47.042
I mean, is that even legal? She's a minor.
Who gave them to her?

41:49.417 --> 41:51.750
Who the hell is she sleeping with?

41:53.708 --> 41:55.708
She's going to bed with some old guy.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
This family's falling apart.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.250
Nobody deals with anything!

42:02.250 --> 42:05.292
We're like lodgers who happen
to be sharing the same house...

42:05.708 --> 42:06.875
and nothing more.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.208
You're mad...

42:27.458 --> 42:29.375
I thought he was, like, in jail.

42:33.125 --> 42:35.417
Only the hottest fashions
in Forte dei Marmi.

42:37.708 --> 42:39.667
Oh, God, guys...

42:41.917 --> 42:43.500
He's coming this way.

42:44.417 --> 42:47.375
Hopefully not. Oh, my God!

42:48.583 --> 42:49.875
Hey, what are you doing?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.542
Little Chiara!
Your face hasn't changed!

42:55.458 --> 42:56.625
Well?

42:56.750 --> 42:58.292
And you?

42:58.958 --> 43:01.583
Maria's birthday parties.
That's it. Remember?

43:01.708 --> 43:04.125
My wife's 'torta paradiso'.

43:04.250 --> 43:06.250
You ate a bit too much of them...

43:06.375 --> 43:09.708
What happened to us all?

43:11.000 --> 43:12.958
I don't know... dunno!

43:13.083 --> 43:14.542
Anyway...

43:18.667 --> 43:20.333
No... no!

43:20.542 --> 43:23.667
That's the September case.
It goes after the April arrest.

43:23.792 --> 43:26.833
September is when they tazered me.

43:26.958 --> 43:29.417
I was minding my own business
in the park.

43:29.542 --> 43:32.500
The police are being pressured
to make more arrests.

43:33.417 --> 43:35.500
"A Safer Future"?!

43:37.333 --> 43:40.583
Not for the likes of me. I'm just
another statistic. Everybody knows.

43:55.208 --> 43:58.292
255 LIKES. ONLY THE HOTTEST FASHIONS
IN FORTE DEI MARMI.

44:16.125 --> 44:18.417
- Did you see this?
- What?

44:19.167 --> 44:22.833
A message from Angela.
"Urgent family meeting 3pm tomorrow."

44:24.167 --> 44:26.375
"No excuses." What's she up to?

44:27.333 --> 44:29.208
We'll find out tomorrow.

44:31.292 --> 44:33.292
No excuses...

44:38.583 --> 44:42.458
The good news is that of the five
families who own Villa Casamora,

44:42.583 --> 44:44.417
four have agreed.

44:44.875 --> 44:47.750
One brother is still holding out.

44:47.875 --> 44:50.542
- Holding out for what?
- He wants more than a fifth.

44:50.667 --> 44:53.167
Good for him. Is he bluffing?

44:53.625 --> 44:56.708
- Honestly, yes.
- Don't mind me.

44:58.625 --> 45:02.167
Now we'll continue
with the subject of the contract...

45:33.917 --> 45:36.458
- It's me...
- Hello.

45:36.667 --> 45:39.167
So.
Are we an unfinished conversation?

45:39.333 --> 45:40.708
Yes...

45:41.292 --> 45:43.000
Look,

45:43.125 --> 45:46.542
if you can think of a place,
I can buy us the time.

45:47.375 --> 45:49.542
- When?
- Tonight?

45:53.375 --> 45:55.792
I mean, I'm pretty sure
I can sort out a babysitter.

45:57.167 --> 46:00.625
Wait. You don't expect me
to look after Federico, do you?

46:01.667 --> 46:04.667
Of course not... It would be inhuman of me
to ask such a thing of you.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.208
He's going to Hugo's house.

46:07.083 --> 46:09.042
And why didn't you tell me
you'd quit your job?

46:11.792 --> 46:13.750
I hate my life. You okay for tonight?

46:13.875 --> 46:15.208
OK...

46:15.333 --> 46:17.375
I'll text you. Bye.

46:20.542 --> 46:21.958
Who was that?

46:23.750 --> 46:25.208
Emma.

46:25.458 --> 46:27.417
She wants to swap nights for days.

46:29.167 --> 46:31.167
- I brought you a coffee.
- Thank you.

47:08.250 --> 47:09.333
Fuck.

47:14.042 --> 47:15.500
"Conditions of sale:

47:15.625 --> 47:18.833
The sale takes place under
the following terms and conditions..."

47:18.958 --> 47:20.583
I'll explain later...

47:20.708 --> 47:23.000
"The real estate under discussion,

47:24.042 --> 47:27.917
are and will be until the date
of the definitive contract of sale..."

47:28.042 --> 47:29.542
Because I have to tell you something...

47:29.667 --> 47:33.042
"... deeds,
free of mortgage restrictions".

47:33.292 --> 47:35.083
- It's that...
- No!

47:35.333 --> 47:37.250
Don't touch him!

47:38.792 --> 47:41.500
You cannot touch him!
Is that clear?

47:43.417 --> 47:45.833
- I didn't want to...
- I'm sorry.

47:45.958 --> 47:48.833
Any touching...
It's like handling dead flesh.

47:50.125 --> 47:52.542
Curzio, I'm sorry, I'm mortified.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.708
Unbelievable!

47:57.250 --> 47:59.458
- I'm finished, I'm going.
- Yes.

48:01.667 --> 48:03.542
- Goodbye.
- I'm sorry.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.458
Dario, you idiot.

48:22.583 --> 48:23.917
And here we have Maria.

48:43.417 --> 48:44.750
Well done, cheers!

48:56.500 --> 48:58.458
Well done, Pilati.

50:05.958 --> 50:07.125
ERASED
REFORMATTED

50:16.542 --> 50:17.667
ERASED
REFORMATTED

50:22.750 --> 50:26.375
Emma! Why would random internal
cameras be reformatted at Pilati's?

50:27.292 --> 50:29.458
Oh, that must have been
Ferrario's team.

50:29.667 --> 50:32.250
Ferrario's team?
Who authorized this?

50:33.375 --> 50:34.625
Your wife.

50:37.708 --> 50:40.625
But history on the perimeter
cameras is stored on the Cloud.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.417
She gave them full access.

50:42.542 --> 50:45.375
They needed to remove any evidence
that Ferrario was there.

50:45.500 --> 50:46.833
Full access.

50:47.042 --> 50:49.042
That fucking fundraiser.

50:49.167 --> 50:51.375
The studio recordings
have vanished as well. Why?

50:51.500 --> 50:54.208
Because Ferrario was in here!
Because we were all in here!

50:54.833 --> 50:56.542
That's why it's not there.

50:57.417 --> 51:00.875
I'm sorry. Claudia said
not to bother you with it.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.625
Don't worry, I'm sorry.

51:04.667 --> 51:06.125
Well done, Claudia.

51:06.875 --> 51:08.667
Brilliant, Claudia.

51:10.542 --> 51:12.375
I hate Hugo.

51:12.500 --> 51:14.958
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

51:25.875 --> 51:28.125
- How's it going?
- Fine.

51:28.417 --> 51:30.917
- Thank you! I owe you!
- Don't worry.

51:31.583 --> 51:33.750
Be good. I love you.

52:26.750 --> 52:28.417
What is it?

52:30.958 --> 52:32.708
He's nocturnal. Like you.

52:32.917 --> 52:35.208
- He's my conscience.
- Not tonight he's not.

53:05.583 --> 53:07.792
Any hidden cameras, Mr. Santini?

53:08.000 --> 53:09.875
Anyone else watching us?

53:20.125 --> 53:22.708
Can thermal cameras
detect sexual arousal?

53:23.792 --> 53:25.708
Definitely.

53:58.792 --> 54:02.750
It's OK, Freddie, it's OK. I'm coming now.
I'm literally getting in my car.

54:03.167 --> 54:04.542
Alright?

54:11.958 --> 54:13.500
Elena!

54:16.625 --> 54:18.125
Elena!

54:19.708 --> 54:22.833
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Federico just called me in a panic.

54:22.958 --> 54:25.125
He never wanted to spend
the night at Hugo's. I made him.

54:25.875 --> 54:27.708
What kind of mother am I?

54:28.292 --> 54:31.417
Do you see why I can't do this
with you? It's like I lose my mind.

54:32.500 --> 54:34.375
I'm sorry, I thought I could,
but this is wrong.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.208
I'm running out of time
to make mistakes.

54:36.333 --> 54:38.542
Mistake? That's what this is now?

54:40.542 --> 54:43.375
You're the one
who said we were unfinished.

54:43.750 --> 54:45.583
And thank God you did.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.292
You know, when...

54:49.583 --> 54:52.500
when we split up, I made a promise.
I promised to myself

54:52.708 --> 54:56.042
that if I couldn't have you,
I wouldn't have anything else.

54:56.667 --> 55:00.000
And that's exactly that I got!
Nothing!

55:00.667 --> 55:02.417
I never allowed anyone else

55:02.542 --> 55:04.833
to make me feel
how I felt with you... alive!

55:05.792 --> 55:08.333
And it's made me... featureless,

55:08.458 --> 55:10.042
like a man with no face...

55:10.583 --> 55:12.125
Look at the baggage I come with.

55:12.250 --> 55:14.708
One son who hates me and another
who can't survive without me.

55:14.833 --> 55:17.250
- Let me speak to Dario.
- No, you don't. I'll handle it.

55:19.167 --> 55:22.292
He was there at Pilati's
the night of the assault.

55:26.750 --> 55:28.583
Why are you telling me this now?

55:28.875 --> 55:31.708
After you've slept with me? Jesus!

55:32.333 --> 55:33.958
Here we are again.

55:34.083 --> 55:37.083
I'm telling you
because it might be him!

55:37.208 --> 55:39.583
I need to talk to him
before anyone else does.

55:39.708 --> 55:42.792
There's no good reason
to let this go any further.

55:59.708 --> 56:03.000
He's upstairs.
You're not doing this without me.

56:14.250 --> 56:16.917
Sunday night. I pulled you over.

56:17.125 --> 56:19.917
You were drunk. Where had you been?

56:21.958 --> 56:23.250
Sunday?

56:24.542 --> 56:28.083
Drinking with a friend. At a bar
in Sarzana. What do you care?

56:28.292 --> 56:30.208
I care because it's not true.

56:30.667 --> 56:32.083
You were at the home of Curzio Pilati.

56:35.208 --> 56:36.542
Or is that not true?

56:36.667 --> 56:39.250
That's true... Sunday, yes.

56:39.792 --> 56:41.792
I worked for the guy, OK?

56:42.167 --> 56:44.458
Mostly nights. Odd jobs.

56:44.792 --> 56:47.583
Running errands. Caretaker stuff.

56:47.750 --> 56:49.292
Dario, I love you,

56:49.500 --> 56:51.875
but what sane person would hire you
to take care of anything?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.792
And this is why I don't tell
my mother what the fuck I'm up to.

56:54.917 --> 56:56.750
How did you meet Pilati?

56:56.875 --> 56:58.167
- Is this an interrogation?
- Yes.

56:59.542 --> 57:02.167
At Gilda's Beach.
He's there for lunch all the time.

57:02.625 --> 57:04.083
Listen Roberto,

57:04.208 --> 57:06.875
he was paying me three times as much
and it beats raking sand.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.667
So talk to me
about the security camera.

57:10.708 --> 57:13.375
- The security camera...
- The one you ripped out of the wall.

57:19.250 --> 57:23.083
OK, I get it now.
You're bangin' my mother,

57:23.208 --> 57:26.833
so now you get to play Dad with me?
Well, it doesn't work that way!

57:30.208 --> 57:33.333
I broke the camera
because he fired me. For no reason.

57:33.667 --> 57:35.500
- The guy's a weirdo.
- And Maria Spezi?

57:35.708 --> 57:37.375
Why was she there?

57:39.125 --> 57:40.792
Well?

57:48.500 --> 57:50.792
Pilati and some other guy found her
wandering around the streets.

57:50.917 --> 57:53.667
- What other guy?
- I don't know. Some guy.

57:53.792 --> 57:56.000
She was trying to get
into the church on Via Trento.

57:56.125 --> 57:59.292
- She was sobbing. They picked her up.
- Whose car?

57:59.458 --> 58:02.000
- Pilati's. The Porsche.
- And she just got into the car.

58:02.125 --> 58:04.000
No, obviously not.

58:04.125 --> 58:07.333
She knew the other guy
and he knew her.

58:08.250 --> 58:11.708
Look, she was really upset
about something.

58:12.792 --> 58:15.667
We all got hammered,
especially the girl.

58:15.917 --> 58:17.875
So we made her coffee...

58:18.000 --> 58:19.667
- A coffee?
- Yes, a coffee.

58:19.792 --> 58:21.583
- It's true.
- Right? See?

58:21.792 --> 58:26.125
We tried to sober her up.
Then I got out of there.

58:26.333 --> 58:27.875
I swear.

58:28.125 --> 58:31.250
Listen, I'm sorry that girl got hurt,

58:31.542 --> 58:35.375
but whatever happened to her,
I don't know anything about it.

58:48.375 --> 58:50.833
The church on Via Trento.

58:51.833 --> 58:53.958
One step at a time...

58:54.875 --> 58:56.958
Easy, easy.

59:20.625 --> 59:23.083
WHERE ARE YOU?
WE HAVE A FAMILY MEETING

59:23.208 --> 59:24.750
Fuck! Fuck!

59:25.042 --> 59:27.917
- Where are you going?
- I forgot something. See you.

59:29.292 --> 59:32.208
You're late. I wrote to you.
Do you not read your cell?

59:33.583 --> 59:34.667
There was traffic.

59:45.208 --> 59:46.708
So, yeah,

59:46.833 --> 59:49.958
my essay is called
'Bone of Contention'.

59:51.708 --> 59:53.000
And,

59:54.000 --> 59:55.875
Mom,
I know you're going to hate this,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.458
but it's time for some family truths
about what happened.

1:00:00.333 --> 1:00:03.917
What actually happened, you know,
when I was seven.

1:00:06.708 --> 1:00:08.292
OK.

1:00:10.875 --> 1:00:14.417
I mean, why is it such a
'Bone of Contention' between you guys?

1:00:14.917 --> 1:00:17.083
Why won't you ever talk about it?

1:00:17.417 --> 1:00:19.917
- Angela, because...
- Because it was so horrible!

1:00:20.750 --> 1:00:23.125
The worst day of my life.

1:00:24.125 --> 1:00:26.542
I lost you for ten minutes
at the park.

1:00:26.875 --> 1:00:29.000
Ten terrible minutes...

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:30.833
ten minutes of agony.

1:00:30.958 --> 1:00:33.542
We found you behind the carousel.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.125
That vile creature, Walter Spezi,
was assaulting you.

1:00:37.250 --> 1:00:39.750
His penis was out.
His pants were covered with semen.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.375
Come on, Claudia...

1:00:41.625 --> 1:00:43.750
Your father tackled him.

1:00:45.458 --> 1:00:48.042
- There. Are you happy now?
- Why can't I remember it?

1:00:48.167 --> 1:00:50.333
Because you were traumatized.

1:00:50.667 --> 1:00:53.333
The mind protects itself.
It needs to forget.

1:00:53.875 --> 1:00:57.208
All I remember is a weird doctor
showing me dolls.

1:00:57.333 --> 1:00:59.417
That was a psychiatrist.
He helped you heal.

1:00:59.542 --> 1:01:02.000
But... why wasn't Spezi convicted?

1:01:02.208 --> 1:01:04.750
You may well ask. You may well ask.

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:11.708
But I'm going to make sure
it doesn't happen twice.

1:01:12.417 --> 1:01:14.125
And this time...

1:01:14.333 --> 1:01:16.667
- he'll pay for it.
- Mom! And off she goes...

1:01:16.917 --> 1:01:19.542
Angela, my love. You just can't go
there with your mother. Let it go.

1:01:19.667 --> 1:01:20.875
Great.

1:01:22.333 --> 1:01:24.042
Really helpful, Dad...

1:01:24.292 --> 1:01:26.917
I can tell you this... it wasn't
semen, but urine. Just so you know.

1:01:27.042 --> 1:01:30.875
On the subject of family truths...
who are the blue pills for?

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:32.708
Claudia...

1:01:37.833 --> 1:01:40.333
I fired Spezi for you.
But it was never enough, was it?

1:01:40.458 --> 1:01:42.792
No, it wasn't enough!

1:01:42.917 --> 1:01:45.292
If you're going to investigate anything,

1:01:45.417 --> 1:01:48.083
you should be investigating
your own daughter

1:01:48.208 --> 1:01:49.917
and her mysterious life.

1:01:50.125 --> 1:01:52.292
- Maybe I don't want to know.
- Sure, that's obvious.

1:02:03.917 --> 1:02:06.625
How many times did I promise you...
that I'd never do it?

1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:09.000
I promised so often!

1:02:18.875 --> 1:02:20.792
Let's try with your date of birth.

1:02:23.167 --> 1:02:25.958
Right,
your date of birth back to front.

1:02:29.542 --> 1:02:32.083
What could you have used,
street number...

1:02:34.417 --> 1:02:36.250
Nope.

1:02:42.667 --> 1:02:44.833
Please don't tell me you're so
stupid to just choose...

1:02:46.292 --> 1:02:47.917
A CODE HAS BEEN SENT
TO YOUR TRUSTED DEVICE

1:02:48.125 --> 1:02:50.292
Angela. Have I taught you nothing?
Five, eight,

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:53.333
three, zero, two, four.

1:02:55.167 --> 1:02:59.167
ANGELA S. TELEPHONE

1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:01.667
Where do you go to every day?

1:03:01.875 --> 1:03:03.333
Monday...

1:03:03.458 --> 1:03:05.958
house and school.

1:03:08.917 --> 1:03:10.458
Tuesday...

1:03:13.167 --> 1:03:15.125
What's this place?

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:17.917
What is this 'Bakery'?

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.167
Where did you go?

1:03:54.042 --> 1:03:55.958
Keep calm.

1:04:00.708 --> 1:04:03.000
"Love! Love, love, love!"

1:04:04.417 --> 1:04:07.083
Who the fuck is this, Angela?

1:04:09.083 --> 1:04:11.500
Who is it? Who the fuck is it?

1:04:11.708 --> 1:04:12.708
MEMORIES

1:04:12.833 --> 1:04:14.458
"Vacations, friends."

1:04:36.667 --> 1:04:39.042
No, no, no.

1:04:53.792 --> 1:04:55.750
How's the writing going?

1:04:57.167 --> 1:04:58.625
Well...

1:04:58.750 --> 1:05:02.458
"I'm trying to discern the truth
from a fog of conflicting memories".

1:05:04.625 --> 1:05:06.083
How did you know I was here?

1:05:08.750 --> 1:05:10.625
I don't believe it! You spied on me!

1:05:10.833 --> 1:05:13.417
- You said you'd never do that.
- Who's the scumbag?

1:05:14.458 --> 1:05:16.917
- Why were you in Milan with him?
- He's not a scumbag.

1:05:18.125 --> 1:05:20.583
He's my professor.

1:05:20.792 --> 1:05:24.417
We were in Milan because
he had a big meeting with his agent.

1:05:24.542 --> 1:05:28.125
He'd a big meeting? And that's
how he seduced you into his bed?

1:05:29.125 --> 1:05:30.333
OK.

1:05:30.708 --> 1:05:34.125
You know what? I may as well tell
you. I'm not going to university.

1:05:34.375 --> 1:05:36.542
I'm moving to Milan with Stefano.

1:05:36.667 --> 1:05:39.458
- You're going nowhere, Angela.
- You don't understand.

1:05:39.625 --> 1:05:43.792
He's writing a novel that might
turnout to be an incredible success.

1:05:43.917 --> 1:05:46.583
- He's lying to you.
- No, he's not!

1:05:46.792 --> 1:05:48.417
Google him.

1:05:48.542 --> 1:05:50.750
Stefano Tommasi.
He's an actual novelist.

1:05:50.875 --> 1:05:54.125
He's had a book published that actual
civilians have bought and read!

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:56.208
You do what you have to do, Angela.

1:05:56.583 --> 1:05:58.583
But there's something I have to do.

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:00.542
I have to tell the police

1:06:00.750 --> 1:06:02.042
that your professor

1:06:02.167 --> 1:06:04.708
was at Pilati's house with Maria Spezi
the night of the assault.

1:06:06.125 --> 1:06:08.375
I have proof. I'm sorry.

1:06:09.958 --> 1:06:11.667
I hate you!

1:06:11.792 --> 1:06:14.708
You don't know anything about love!

1:06:20.125 --> 1:06:22.458
You don't know anything about love!

1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.333
Let's see. Maria.

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:42.833
You said the only people at the house
with you that night were Mr. Pilati

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:45.958
and some boy
whose name you couldn't remember.

1:06:47.958 --> 1:06:49.417
Yes.

1:06:49.750 --> 1:06:51.792
Any luck remembering the boy's name?

1:06:54.917 --> 1:06:55.917
No.

1:06:57.750 --> 1:06:59.583
And no one else was there?

1:07:04.833 --> 1:07:05.958
No.

1:07:06.208 --> 1:07:08.250
So you didn't arrive there
with Pilati

1:07:08.375 --> 1:07:10.792
and your teacher, Stefano Tommasi?

1:07:14.375 --> 1:07:15.958
No...

1:07:17.042 --> 1:07:18.750
Tommasi

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.250
left before anything happened.

1:07:21.708 --> 1:07:23.750
That's convenient.

1:07:24.667 --> 1:07:28.333
Is there anyone you're not covering
for in this story?

1:07:35.375 --> 1:07:38.292
I don't feel so good.
I need to leave.

1:07:42.333 --> 1:07:44.625
Got anything more
you want to tell us?

1:07:45.750 --> 1:07:48.125
I didn't hurt my daughter.

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:49.958
Neither did anyone else, it seems.

1:07:54.375 --> 1:07:56.333
Well, I have a question...

1:07:57.167 --> 1:07:58.542
Walter.

1:07:59.625 --> 1:08:02.292
Do you think you deserve
a daughter like that?

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:05.542
No. I do not.

1:08:15.542 --> 1:08:18.083
I left before anything happened.

1:08:18.792 --> 1:08:20.708
I went home. I swear.

1:08:22.042 --> 1:08:23.583
- Home.
- Yes.

1:08:24.417 --> 1:08:26.500
Anyone who can verify that?

1:08:43.042 --> 1:08:45.667
Mr. Pilati, we're ready.
Whenever you want.

1:08:45.792 --> 1:08:48.708
- Oh, here she is!
- You lied to me.

1:08:48.833 --> 1:08:51.333
You told me you
were in Milan when it happened.

1:08:51.458 --> 1:08:52.917
No, I didn't.

1:08:53.042 --> 1:08:54.583
I said I wasn't there
when it happened.

1:08:54.667 --> 1:08:56.042
I'd left them all in the kitchen.

1:08:56.250 --> 1:08:59.750
Claudia, you of all people should
understand how this might look...

1:08:59.875 --> 1:09:02.708
not just for me, for us,
for the campaign.

1:09:02.833 --> 1:09:04.375
You know how many people
would like to read...

1:09:04.500 --> 1:09:06.917
- Can we get a photo, please?
- Yeah, sure.

1:09:07.042 --> 1:09:10.375
"Pilati employee
arrested for sexual assault".

1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:12.792
My lawyers are seriously worried.

1:09:12.917 --> 1:09:14.458
You have to help me here, Claudia.

1:09:14.583 --> 1:09:17.792
Look, if it happened in my house,
which I still pray it didn't,

1:09:18.250 --> 1:09:19.958
I did the right thing.

1:09:20.083 --> 1:09:23.042
I fired the boy, Dario,
my caretaker. He's wild.

1:09:24.125 --> 1:09:26.375
- Dario?
- Yes, his name's Dario Nobile.

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:29.417
- He begged me to take him back, but...
- Fuck!

1:09:29.542 --> 1:09:31.417
Mr. Pilati, the ribbon...?

1:09:31.625 --> 1:09:33.333
What a great idea.

1:09:38.250 --> 1:09:39.583
- Well done, Claudia.
- Thank you.

1:09:39.792 --> 1:09:41.458
- Our mayor...
- Excuse me...

1:09:47.583 --> 1:09:49.792
You're avoiding me!

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:53.083
You're not even pretending
to sleep on the sofa.

1:09:53.667 --> 1:09:56.375
What the fuck are you doing,
incriminating Pilati?

1:09:56.500 --> 1:10:00.292
He's bringing in lawyers from Milan.
But I get it now.

1:10:00.917 --> 1:10:03.500
You're trying to protect
that lunatic Dario.

1:10:03.708 --> 1:10:05.417
Your fucking future stepson!

1:10:05.542 --> 1:10:07.542
I'm just gathering all the facts,

1:10:07.667 --> 1:10:09.750
Trying to sort the truth from the...

1:10:09.875 --> 1:10:12.042
- May we?
- Yes, of course.

1:10:12.292 --> 1:10:14.375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:10:16.667 --> 1:10:18.042
Don't make that face!

1:10:18.250 --> 1:10:20.500
- What face?
- The judging-my-ambition face.

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.458
This is my chance, Roberto.

1:10:26.958 --> 1:10:29.042
My only chance.

1:10:29.292 --> 1:10:32.625
This is my life
and I won't let you get in the way,

1:10:32.833 --> 1:10:36.333
not you, not our marriage,
is that clear?

1:10:40.125 --> 1:10:42.000
Yes, I'm ambitious.

1:10:42.375 --> 1:10:45.833
But you know what? To some people,
that's a very attractive trait.

1:10:55.208 --> 1:10:56.833
Claudia, wait!

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.500
You want to explain yourself?

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.500
Matteo. Would you mind doing that
thing you do...?

1:11:09.542 --> 1:11:10.958
Go.

1:11:15.250 --> 1:11:17.542
I wasn't always like this.

1:11:18.208 --> 1:11:20.250
You mean secretive?

1:11:20.417 --> 1:11:22.833
No. I mean the way I am.

1:11:25.750 --> 1:11:27.667
When that woman touched me,
in the kitchen,

1:11:27.792 --> 1:11:29.958
and you jumped to my defense...

1:11:30.083 --> 1:11:32.708
without a second thought.
It's so like you.

1:11:33.125 --> 1:11:35.833
Fierce. Heart first.

1:11:37.250 --> 1:11:39.458
It made me feel... less alone.

1:11:39.583 --> 1:11:42.292
Like you understood me,
without wanting anything from me.

1:11:42.417 --> 1:11:45.042
Can you imagine what that felt like?

1:11:49.042 --> 1:11:50.542
This...

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:53.000
'thing' I have, this condition,

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:55.083
it's devastating, you know.

1:11:55.667 --> 1:11:59.208
And it came out of nowhere.
I've tried and tried,

1:12:00.250 --> 1:12:03.667
but no-one seems to be able to trace
it back to anything, to find a cause.

1:12:04.167 --> 1:12:06.125
It's made relationships...

1:12:07.042 --> 1:12:10.167
impossible. I'd freeze,

1:12:12.917 --> 1:12:16.583
I'd shake and, yes, sometimes
I'd... crumble.

1:12:17.042 --> 1:12:19.375
And women always felt rejected,

1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:22.500
no matter what I said.
Of course they did.

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.458
So I chose loneliness,

1:12:26.708 --> 1:12:28.750
it was so much easier.

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:31.708
Anyway,
I've always been a private person.

1:12:32.875 --> 1:12:36.042
I'm a very wealthy man
and I can afford anything I want.

1:12:36.833 --> 1:12:39.708
Except the thing I want most...

1:12:40.042 --> 1:12:41.792
intimacy.

1:12:42.792 --> 1:12:45.708
The kind of love you deserve.

1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:53.375
I want to deal with this,
get the best help I can.

1:12:53.583 --> 1:12:55.292
I want to be with you.

1:12:55.542 --> 1:12:58.292
Really be with you. Now.

1:12:58.417 --> 1:13:00.417
In this universe.

1:13:03.708 --> 1:13:05.875
You're an extraordinary man, Curzio.

1:13:06.667 --> 1:13:08.417
I'll help you.

1:13:11.417 --> 1:13:12.708
I'm sorry.

1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:15.833
- The reception...
- Yes.

1:13:23.542 --> 1:13:25.875
RAPIST

1:13:27.250 --> 1:13:30.583
Mr. Tommasi
will not be attending class today.

1:13:30.708 --> 1:13:32.125
You are all dismissed.

1:13:32.250 --> 1:13:34.917
This is insane, guys.
I mean, Mr. Tommasi and Maria?

1:13:41.542 --> 1:13:46.708
HE'S NOT A RAPIST

1:14:33.375 --> 1:14:35.708
Why aren't you at school, Angela?

1:14:35.833 --> 1:14:38.833
What was Pilati doing here just now?
What has he got on you?

1:14:38.958 --> 1:14:40.708
- Listen...
- Look at yourself!

1:14:40.833 --> 1:14:43.458
It's like he reduced you to some
pathetic, lame version of yourself.

1:14:43.583 --> 1:14:45.875
Sit down, Angela.
I have to tell you something.

1:14:49.125 --> 1:14:51.333
I haven't been writing my novel.

1:14:51.625 --> 1:14:54.625
- What?
- I'm ghost-writing a book for Pilati.

1:14:57.542 --> 1:14:59.833
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Well,

1:15:00.083 --> 1:15:03.000
it's not exactly how I envisioned
my career as a writer.

1:15:03.125 --> 1:15:04.917
But you know what?

1:15:05.542 --> 1:15:08.292
He's had a really interesting life.

1:15:08.417 --> 1:15:10.292
Made his millions on debt management.

1:15:10.417 --> 1:15:13.333
He doesn't have any family,
he wants this to be his legacy.

1:15:13.667 --> 1:15:17.208
Honestly, there's something there.
He's a bit of a rebel.

1:15:17.667 --> 1:15:19.708
Genius? Rebel? The guy's an asshole!

1:15:19.833 --> 1:15:21.750
Well, that asshole's paying me.

1:15:21.917 --> 1:15:25.292
That's serious money. The stuff
I need to support my ex-wife?

1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:27.167
I'm going to ask you one last time.

1:15:27.292 --> 1:15:29.542
And if you lie to me again,
I'm going to call the principal

1:15:29.667 --> 1:15:33.000
and tell him we have fucked
approximately 200 times since June!

1:15:34.042 --> 1:15:36.292
What were you doing Sunday night?

1:15:36.958 --> 1:15:39.417
I've already told the police.

1:15:46.792 --> 1:15:48.542
OK.

1:15:48.667 --> 1:15:52.083
You know what you and I are going
to do now? We're leaving.

1:15:52.292 --> 1:15:54.583
We'll go someplace.
We'll go and live...

1:15:54.708 --> 1:15:56.750
someplace we like.

1:15:56.958 --> 1:16:00.583
I'll work my ass off and I'll support you.
You write, nothing else.

1:16:01.583 --> 1:16:03.417
You're talented.
You wrote a bestseller!

1:16:03.625 --> 1:16:05.333
Ten years ago!

1:16:06.875 --> 1:16:08.708
Ten fucking years ago!

1:16:11.167 --> 1:16:13.375
It could be like we're starting out.

1:16:17.083 --> 1:16:18.958
Starting out?! I'm 40!

1:16:20.042 --> 1:16:22.042
Look, Angela, you're wonderful.

1:16:22.917 --> 1:16:24.750
You're fantastic.

1:16:26.958 --> 1:16:30.292
But maybe it's not such a great idea
to be thinking long-term with me.

1:16:31.333 --> 1:16:32.917
This is insane.

1:16:33.042 --> 1:16:35.917
It can't go on. We knew from
the start that it wouldn't last.

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.333
One of us has to be the adult here.

1:16:40.125 --> 1:16:42.625
And a quick check of our driver's licenses
shows that would be me.

1:16:45.333 --> 1:16:47.292
One day you'll understand.

1:16:48.042 --> 1:16:49.833
One day you'll understand.

1:17:31.750 --> 1:17:34.542
- Something's happened.
- I'll go for a smoke.

1:17:37.417 --> 1:17:40.125
- Dad...
- Love... what is it?

1:17:41.958 --> 1:17:45.375
Don't tell Mom. Please don't tell Mom.
Don't tell the school.

1:17:47.875 --> 1:17:49.917
He broke up with me.

1:17:50.167 --> 1:17:52.000
It hurts so much.

1:17:55.083 --> 1:17:57.042
Tell me everything.

1:17:57.417 --> 1:18:00.542
Sit down.
What happened to you?

1:18:01.333 --> 1:18:03.000
Tell me.

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.333
He said we shouldn't think long-term.

1:18:08.917 --> 1:18:10.833
We shouldn't think long-term.

1:18:11.708 --> 1:18:15.042
He said one of us
has to be the adult.

1:18:15.583 --> 1:18:17.250
One of us has to be the adult.

1:18:20.458 --> 1:18:21.875
He told me to leave.

1:18:22.292 --> 1:18:23.875
Leave. Leave.

1:18:27.042 --> 1:18:28.500
Dad?

1:18:29.583 --> 1:18:30.583
Are you OK?

1:18:30.792 --> 1:18:32.292
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

1:18:33.875 --> 1:18:35.875
I need a glass of water.

1:18:48.417 --> 1:18:50.375
Ah, enter Zeus!

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.875
Here to defend his beloved daughter,
Athena!

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:55.708
Sunday night, did the boy leave
before or after you?

1:18:58.083 --> 1:19:00.042
Well done! Well done!

1:19:00.542 --> 1:19:02.375
I could ruin you.

1:19:02.500 --> 1:19:04.667
I know you slept with my daughter,
your student.

1:19:04.875 --> 1:19:07.083
I know you're the reason Maria,
another student of yours,

1:19:07.208 --> 1:19:08.917
got into that car.
I have incriminating evidence.

1:19:09.042 --> 1:19:10.875
You were an accomplice
to whatever happened.

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.583
And you have a motive
for lying about all of it.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:16.917
Did you leave
before or after the boy?

1:19:21.250 --> 1:19:22.833
Well,

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:26.625
I mean,
the whole 'damsel in distress' thing

1:19:27.708 --> 1:19:30.167
has a certain cachet in erotica,

1:19:30.417 --> 1:19:34.500
but frankly I've always found it
rather depressing.

1:19:35.833 --> 1:19:37.958
I wanted to take the girl home

1:19:39.417 --> 1:19:42.167
to her father,
but she insisted on staying...

1:19:42.625 --> 1:19:44.250
so...

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.625
I left.

1:19:46.750 --> 1:19:49.042
Before the boy.

1:19:51.833 --> 1:19:54.875
Anyway, I already had a willing
damsel waiting between my sheets.

1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:56.542
You smug piece of shit!

1:19:56.750 --> 1:19:58.667
You piece of shit!

1:20:06.625 --> 1:20:07.875
You're ridiculous!

1:20:10.083 --> 1:20:12.167
You really can't handle it, eh?

1:20:20.792 --> 1:20:22.375
Roberto, come here.

1:20:22.917 --> 1:20:24.375
Look!

1:20:26.917 --> 1:20:29.500
"My father had been changed
in a fundamental way.

1:20:30.750 --> 1:20:33.167
Things that had once been
unthinkable in him

1:20:33.292 --> 1:20:35.417
suddenly became a reality.

1:20:36.083 --> 1:20:37.500
He was...

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:40.750
- like a ticking bomb..."
- Poor girl...

1:20:40.958 --> 1:20:42.625
What is this?

1:20:42.958 --> 1:20:46.667
Footage they filmed in secret
of Maria Spezi during a lesson.

1:20:47.042 --> 1:20:49.875
They've just put it up and
it's already got over 800 views.

1:20:50.375 --> 1:20:55.292
How on earth did no-one see
the warning signs?

1:20:55.750 --> 1:20:59.292
"If you show your fear,
you bait the beast.

1:20:59.458 --> 1:21:02.208
And so I hid it.
And so I hide it to this day..."

1:21:02.417 --> 1:21:04.417
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1:21:04.542 --> 1:21:06.708
You still think he's innocent?

1:21:06.833 --> 1:21:08.750
"He would pass out
night after night.

1:21:10.792 --> 1:21:14.083
I would fall asleep in the chair
next to his makeshift bed...

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:18.458
I would wake up to find him
staring at me with eyes

1:21:18.583 --> 1:21:20.750
that seemed to be hollowed out...

1:21:22.583 --> 1:21:24.333
His undying anger at the town

1:21:24.583 --> 1:21:26.750
over a wrongful arrest
that happened years ago

1:21:27.917 --> 1:21:30.708
had become a rage
at the very universe.

1:21:31.333 --> 1:21:32.792
A universe

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.833
that was no more likely to give him
justice than his own community.

1:21:38.375 --> 1:21:41.958
A community he now saw
as heartless and corrupt...

1:21:42.750 --> 1:21:47.000
After my mother died, a strange
inversion had taken place.

1:21:48.417 --> 1:21:51.375
I had become the parent
and he was the child...

1:21:52.792 --> 1:21:56.042
I thought it was just a temporary
arrangement, a function of his drinking

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:58.333
I thought it was
just a temporary arrangement..."

1:21:58.458 --> 1:21:59.667
Turn it off!

1:22:01.083 --> 1:22:03.625
Turn it off! Ginevra recorded it!

1:22:03.750 --> 1:22:05.542
"But as the weeks went past,

1:22:05.833 --> 1:22:09.208
I started to understand that
the situation would never change,

1:22:10.208 --> 1:22:12.250
I would never be free.

1:22:17.250 --> 1:22:19.792
I would never be free".

1:22:23.208 --> 1:22:24.667
And...

1:22:24.792 --> 1:22:27.375
3,700 VIEWS

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:29.833
The end.

1:23:52.625 --> 1:23:54.500
What happened to you?

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.208
Six of our prime accounts cancelled
their contracts this morning.

1:24:00.292 --> 1:24:02.458
I've been on the phone for hours.

1:24:03.042 --> 1:24:06.250
They're saying you're 'unstable',

1:24:06.917 --> 1:24:08.583
'violent'.

1:24:21.375 --> 1:24:22.583
Maria...

1:24:22.708 --> 1:24:24.417
Wait, please.

1:24:30.417 --> 1:24:31.875
Emma?

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.083
What clients
went back on the contract?

1:24:45.208 --> 1:24:47.667
Emma! The clients
who went back on the contract.

1:24:52.083 --> 1:24:53.208
It's all clear!

1:24:53.583 --> 1:24:56.125
They're all friends of Pilati.

1:24:56.708 --> 1:24:58.625
Can you bring up
their perimeter history?

1:24:59.208 --> 1:25:01.083
I just trashed it all.

1:25:01.458 --> 1:25:03.625
There was a court order.

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:06.500
How many times do I have to tell you?
Nothing's ever trashed.

1:25:06.708 --> 1:25:08.583
- Client one!
- That's Dario's car!

1:25:08.708 --> 1:25:11.500
Client two! Client three!

1:25:11.625 --> 1:25:13.583
What are they hiding?

1:25:13.792 --> 1:25:15.583
Dario, what else did you do that night?

1:25:15.833 --> 1:25:18.167
Client five.

1:25:18.292 --> 1:25:20.583
Are you getting this? Look!

1:25:21.167 --> 1:25:24.167
No... Maria was already injured.

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:28.958
Dario, you're a liar...

1:25:30.750 --> 1:25:32.292
It wasn't Spezi.

1:25:32.417 --> 1:25:34.708
They arrested him at 2.56!

1:25:39.333 --> 1:25:41.333
Unstable and violent.

1:25:46.667 --> 1:25:48.042
Maria.

1:25:48.167 --> 1:25:50.792
Please come to class today.

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.167
Stefano's back.

1:25:54.708 --> 1:25:56.375
I'll walk in with you.

1:26:12.583 --> 1:26:15.292
Let's start by taking this
to Mr. and Mrs. Grassi.

1:26:15.417 --> 1:26:18.083
Sorry? Can you give us a moment, please?
Thank you.

1:26:19.625 --> 1:26:21.125
- What happened to you?
- Never mind!

1:26:21.250 --> 1:26:24.000
Dario lied to you.
He lied to both of us.

1:26:24.542 --> 1:26:26.750
It can only get worse for him.

1:26:27.833 --> 1:26:30.875
He has to start telling the truth.
He has to go to the police.

1:26:32.375 --> 1:26:34.417
If you want, I'll go with him.

1:26:56.750 --> 1:26:59.208
I used to be your master electrician.

1:27:01.167 --> 1:27:04.917
Now I'm lucky if someone trusts me
with their toaster.

1:27:08.333 --> 1:27:10.458
Look at us, a couple of outcasts.

1:27:10.792 --> 1:27:13.125
Or as my wife would put it,
'undesirables'...

1:27:14.583 --> 1:27:16.250
A couple of rejects.

1:27:18.833 --> 1:27:21.333
Why did you say it was your fault
when they found you with Maria?

1:27:23.375 --> 1:27:24.833
Because it was.

1:27:24.958 --> 1:27:27.667
We'd had a fight in the afternoon.
Over my drinking.

1:27:30.167 --> 1:27:32.708
She ran away and I was too drunk...

1:27:35.417 --> 1:27:37.542
to stop her. That's the thing.

1:27:38.250 --> 1:27:41.083
I could have stopped her. Everything
that's happened to her is my fault.

1:27:41.333 --> 1:27:43.542
I'm a useless fucker.

1:27:46.333 --> 1:27:50.042
I just wish she'd written about
the good times in her story.

1:27:50.750 --> 1:27:53.792
- There were good times, you know.
- I know there were.

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.708
Roberto...

1:28:03.708 --> 1:28:05.583
After that incident

1:28:06.417 --> 1:28:08.000
with Angela,

1:28:09.292 --> 1:28:12.833
you had to fire me, I can see that now.
But you know I would never...

1:28:15.042 --> 1:28:17.167
I owe you an apology, Walt.

1:28:18.583 --> 1:28:20.375
We all do.

1:28:28.125 --> 1:28:30.042
"All I wanted was a ride
on a carousel.

1:28:30.167 --> 1:28:33.375
A carefree,
pointless trip to the heavens.

1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.625
But when I got there,
the carousel was broken.

1:28:43.375 --> 1:28:45.667
My mother
never left a door unlocked

1:28:46.083 --> 1:28:48.708
or a seatbelt unfastened.

1:28:49.333 --> 1:28:52.583
If a dog appeared on our street,
she called the dog pound.

1:28:53.292 --> 1:28:56.208
So... to lose a daughter...

1:28:57.917 --> 1:29:00.042
It shook the core of her world."

1:29:21.125 --> 1:29:23.042
How did you meet?

1:29:23.583 --> 1:29:25.250
At Gilda's Beach.

1:29:28.542 --> 1:29:32.708
He loved that the girls
were hot for me.

1:29:34.208 --> 1:29:35.875
He said

1:29:36.250 --> 1:29:38.208
I made him feel younger.

1:29:42.833 --> 1:29:45.500
And then one day he said
that if I wanted, I could...

1:29:45.750 --> 1:29:48.542
I could use his house to get laid...

1:29:49.167 --> 1:29:50.500
And I said yes right away.

1:29:53.333 --> 1:29:54.833
I didn't even think about it!

1:29:59.917 --> 1:30:04.458
His only deal
was I had to do it in the den,

1:30:05.125 --> 1:30:07.417
not in his bedroom.

1:30:08.250 --> 1:30:12.083
I thought it was a germ thing.

1:30:15.042 --> 1:30:16.833
But then...

1:30:17.375 --> 1:30:19.542
I found out the real reason.

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:09.833
Look, I'm not proud of it.

1:31:11.917 --> 1:31:13.875
I fucked up.

1:31:14.542 --> 1:31:16.833
But I thought
that for me it was only about

1:31:16.958 --> 1:31:19.042
going to bed with these girls.

1:31:19.167 --> 1:31:20.917
And anyway they were all consenting.

1:31:21.042 --> 1:31:23.375
You can check that if you like.

1:31:27.042 --> 1:31:29.875
- Did Pilati pay you for this?
- Oh, yeah.

1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:32.500
Cash.

1:31:32.958 --> 1:31:35.458
And the bonuses
got bigger and bigger.

1:31:37.083 --> 1:31:38.542
Tell me about Maria.

1:31:39.917 --> 1:31:42.458
"I could hear them all shouting
my name.

1:31:42.875 --> 1:31:46.417
But I just wanted someone, anyone to make
the carousel go round and round..."

1:31:46.958 --> 1:31:48.958
Where's the mechanic?

1:31:49.167 --> 1:31:51.083
"And there he was...

1:31:51.292 --> 1:31:52.875
the man who fixes everything."

1:31:53.833 --> 1:31:55.583
Sir, can you repair the carousel?

1:31:55.708 --> 1:31:59.417
"I knew he'd magic it
back into motion for me.

1:32:02.417 --> 1:32:05.500
How could he know how tragic
his timing would prove to be...?

1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:09.542
Such an innocuous moment.

1:32:11.375 --> 1:32:13.333
Such a ruinous result."

1:32:14.917 --> 1:32:17.292
I mean, Maria was different.

1:32:19.583 --> 1:32:21.417
Everything went wrong.

1:32:23.208 --> 1:32:25.917
You could tell she was really young,

1:32:27.250 --> 1:32:28.583
but...

1:32:28.792 --> 1:32:31.750
Pilati doesn't care.
I keep topping up her glass.

1:32:31.958 --> 1:32:34.458
Like I did with all the other girls.

1:32:34.917 --> 1:32:36.167
Hi...

1:32:36.292 --> 1:32:37.542
Drink, drink, drink...

1:32:37.750 --> 1:32:39.583
The other guy,
the one she knows,

1:32:40.042 --> 1:32:42.917
he's getting nervous. He splits.

1:32:43.167 --> 1:32:45.375
No, don't go, don't go...

1:32:45.625 --> 1:32:48.792
- I need to go.
- Please... please.

1:32:51.833 --> 1:32:54.875
Pilati, man,
he can't stop staring at her.

1:32:56.333 --> 1:32:59.375
It's like he was feeling her
with his eyes.

1:33:01.833 --> 1:33:03.500
And I mean...

1:33:03.625 --> 1:33:06.833
you could tell he had a...
he was getting hard.

1:33:12.583 --> 1:33:13.625
I'm sorry...

1:33:13.833 --> 1:33:14.917
"...I was never scared.

1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.833
In fact, I was kind of fascinated...

1:33:21.083 --> 1:33:24.500
...it was more like watching a horse

1:33:24.708 --> 1:33:26.417
taking a piss in the street."

1:33:36.542 --> 1:33:38.625
I kissed her once

1:33:38.750 --> 1:33:42.125
but it was ridiculous.
I couldn't do it.

1:33:43.042 --> 1:33:46.042
She was too drunk.
It just wasn't right, you know?

1:33:49.375 --> 1:33:53.542
We tried to sober her up,
gave her coffee.

1:33:54.333 --> 1:33:56.583
- Who made the coffee?
- Pilati.

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:58.458
But...

1:33:59.833 --> 1:34:03.500
it didn't help. Next thing I know,
she's passed out.

1:34:09.208 --> 1:34:10.667
Now...

1:34:11.833 --> 1:34:13.708
he's right there with me,

1:34:17.875 --> 1:34:20.625
unbuttoning her blouse,

1:34:20.750 --> 1:34:25.000
but like really slow and careful so
he doesn't actually touch her skin.

1:34:25.292 --> 1:34:28.083
And he's sweating.
And he looks at me, like...

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.667
'take over', your turn now.
And I'm, like, no way.

1:34:32.250 --> 1:34:34.792
I couldn't, I didn't want to.

1:34:38.042 --> 1:34:40.375
So he yells at me to get out.

1:34:43.958 --> 1:34:45.917
I was very drunk.

1:34:46.750 --> 1:34:48.833
I don't remember anything,
I remember that I...

1:34:48.958 --> 1:34:51.625
I broke this camera, Roberto's...

1:34:53.833 --> 1:34:56.125
And then I heard Maria screaming.

1:34:59.458 --> 1:35:01.292
What the fuck are you doing?

1:35:01.542 --> 1:35:04.667
"All the ingredients were there.
A man holding his penis.

1:35:05.375 --> 1:35:07.125
A curious little girl.

1:35:07.333 --> 1:35:10.042
A mother consumed with blind panic.

1:35:10.167 --> 1:35:12.000
I was crying,

1:35:12.208 --> 1:35:14.250
but only because I cut my lip
in the fall.

1:35:16.333 --> 1:35:18.083
Try telling that to my mother.

1:35:18.250 --> 1:35:19.917
Try telling her it was urine,

1:35:20.042 --> 1:35:22.750
not semen on Spezi's pants."

1:35:30.208 --> 1:35:32.792
He was like an animal.

1:35:35.417 --> 1:35:36.792
Beating her up.

1:35:39.042 --> 1:35:42.167
Kicking her in the head, really hard.

1:35:43.208 --> 1:35:44.750
And I...

1:35:50.542 --> 1:35:54.333
Then he wants her back on the chair,

1:35:56.333 --> 1:35:58.542
so he grabs her by the wrist
and yanks.

1:36:00.125 --> 1:36:03.375
I'm amazed her fucking arm
didn't come off.

1:36:09.250 --> 1:36:12.708
And he's screaming at me
like it's my fault.

1:36:16.625 --> 1:36:18.208
He said to me...

1:36:18.917 --> 1:36:20.125
"I had to try".

1:36:20.333 --> 1:36:22.000
I had to try!

1:36:22.917 --> 1:36:24.958
I had to try!
I thought I wouldn't feel it!

1:36:25.708 --> 1:36:27.708
- And I'm like, feel what?
- The death,

1:36:27.833 --> 1:36:30.750
I thought I wouldn't feel
the death in her flesh!

1:36:37.292 --> 1:36:40.292
Get her out of here.

1:36:58.083 --> 1:37:01.375
"No other angle of the truth
was ever allowed in our house.

1:37:01.833 --> 1:37:03.708
It had to be my mother's,

1:37:03.875 --> 1:37:05.583
the one born of fear,

1:37:05.958 --> 1:37:09.417
the one that absolved her from
losing me in the first place,

1:37:11.042 --> 1:37:13.292
the one thing
she loved most in the world.

1:37:14.250 --> 1:37:16.667
I've never understood this story

1:37:16.917 --> 1:37:18.625
because
I've never understood my mother.

1:37:21.375 --> 1:37:22.875
But now I do.

1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:32.000
Would this have been a better
story if I had been traumatized?

1:37:32.792 --> 1:37:34.208
More interesting?

1:37:35.917 --> 1:37:37.417
Probably.

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.167
But that's not the story
I'm telling."

1:37:48.333 --> 1:37:50.125
Just for your information,

1:37:50.333 --> 1:37:53.542
the long key's for his main door.
He's all yours!

1:38:04.250 --> 1:38:05.708
She was...

1:38:06.167 --> 1:38:09.042
she was... so frightened by me.

1:38:11.125 --> 1:38:14.583
She... jumped out of the car.

1:38:18.500 --> 1:38:22.417
And I was... looking for her when
Roberto stopped me, because...

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:26.042
I wanted to do something.
I wanted to help her.

1:38:26.875 --> 1:38:27.958
But...

1:38:35.625 --> 1:38:37.167
Fuck!

1:38:38.625 --> 1:38:41.292
The guy's gonna kill me!

1:38:44.750 --> 1:38:46.625
Don't worry.

1:38:54.958 --> 1:38:57.750
Other than alcohol,
what showed up in toxicology?

1:38:58.375 --> 1:39:02.125
I told you.
Just the painkiller, Oxycodone.

1:40:31.167 --> 1:40:34.292
- How many times have you slept with her?
- Once.

1:40:36.083 --> 1:40:38.167
Roberto, please.

1:40:38.292 --> 1:40:40.167
At least tell the truth.

1:40:40.792 --> 1:40:43.125
- It is the truth.
- Sure!

1:40:43.250 --> 1:40:45.333
But it's not the reason.

1:40:47.875 --> 1:40:49.500
You know as well as I do...

1:40:51.708 --> 1:40:52.917
this marriage is done.

1:40:53.833 --> 1:40:56.208
And Angela's already got one foot
out of the door.

1:40:59.208 --> 1:41:01.250
Explain something to me, Roberto.

1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:05.458
Do you really want to take an axe
to everything we've built together?

1:41:06.208 --> 1:41:09.458
The business? The family?
Your career?

1:41:11.542 --> 1:41:13.625
And all to be

1:41:14.208 --> 1:41:17.625
with some lonely woman
and her screwed-up kids.

1:41:18.125 --> 1:41:20.542
Just because you want to play
at being 19 again.

1:41:22.333 --> 1:41:24.042
Are you sure that it's really love

1:41:24.542 --> 1:41:26.667
and not another kind of sleepwalking?

1:41:27.708 --> 1:41:29.208
I honestly...

1:41:29.875 --> 1:41:31.333
don't know.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.125
But it's worth the risk.

1:42:00.583 --> 1:42:02.625
There's something
I have to ask you...

1:42:03.583 --> 1:42:06.292
were you aware that Ferrario's people
erased more than just

1:42:06.417 --> 1:42:08.083
the fundraiser footage?

1:42:11.250 --> 1:42:12.333
I thought so.

1:42:13.083 --> 1:42:14.417
The guy is sick

1:42:14.667 --> 1:42:16.292
and evil, Claudia.

1:42:18.250 --> 1:42:21.417
- Who can buy his way out of anything.
- Maybe.

1:42:21.708 --> 1:42:24.208
But I can't help wondering...

1:42:24.333 --> 1:42:28.667
why would a girl pass out right after
she was given coffee to sober her up?

1:42:28.792 --> 1:42:30.208
Strange, no?

1:42:33.583 --> 1:42:35.417
Claudia, she could have died.

1:42:42.625 --> 1:42:44.292
That guy...

1:42:45.208 --> 1:42:47.375
That guy made me feel alive again!

1:42:48.208 --> 1:42:51.625
Whatever Pilati did, whoever he is...

1:42:51.958 --> 1:42:53.708
he gave me a taste of something...

1:42:54.750 --> 1:42:56.250
I'd forgotten.

1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.667
But that's my problem, not yours.

1:42:59.875 --> 1:43:02.292
And I'll tell you something else,
Roberto,

1:43:02.708 --> 1:43:05.250
it's the last time
I let myself be defined by a man.

1:43:05.583 --> 1:43:07.042
Any man.

1:43:44.583 --> 1:43:45.833
Who are you?

1:43:47.417 --> 1:43:49.833
I'm Maria's father, Walter Spezi.

1:43:50.292 --> 1:43:51.958
What do you want?

1:43:52.333 --> 1:43:54.833
I want to know
what happened Sunday night.

1:43:55.792 --> 1:43:58.917
Mr. Spezi, I really feel for you,
but sadly...

1:43:59.042 --> 1:44:02.958
everything's come to light,
the parties, the drugs...

1:44:03.542 --> 1:44:06.208
I'm raging at that pig Dario,

1:44:06.458 --> 1:44:10.083
He's been abusing his privilege
as my caretaker for some time.

1:44:10.208 --> 1:44:13.583
Maria's not the first girl
he's brought up here to seduce,

1:44:13.708 --> 1:44:15.583
I can tell you that.

1:44:15.708 --> 1:44:19.208
Your issue is with the boy.
Talk to him.

1:44:19.333 --> 1:44:22.667
Dario Nobile,
Via Donati, I think?

1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:27.042
- But Roberto...
- Let me tell you about Santini,

1:44:27.167 --> 1:44:29.958
he's fucking Dario's mother.
The whole town knows.

1:44:30.083 --> 1:44:32.417
Of course
he's going to protect the boy.

1:44:32.542 --> 1:44:36.167
I'm sorry. I really am. You deserve
better. Apologies, I have to go.

1:45:12.250 --> 1:45:15.250
- What do you say we go watch a show?
- Alright.

1:45:17.208 --> 1:45:18.542
Bye.

1:45:23.583 --> 1:45:26.750
I talked to Claudia.
I told her everything.

1:45:28.542 --> 1:45:30.000
What did she say?

1:45:30.417 --> 1:45:32.583
Mom, there's a scary man.

1:45:32.792 --> 1:45:34.958
- I'll kill you.
- Call the police!

1:45:35.083 --> 1:45:37.250
- Walter!
- You're a liar!

1:45:37.375 --> 1:45:39.750
- Walter, what the fuck are you doing?
- Leave me alone.

1:45:40.625 --> 1:45:42.750
He's trying to kill my son!

1:45:42.958 --> 1:45:45.167
- Leave me alone!
- Look at me!

1:45:45.292 --> 1:45:47.917
It's me, Walter. Look at me!

1:45:48.583 --> 1:45:51.875
- Leave me alone!
- It wasn't Dario. It was Pilati.

1:45:52.125 --> 1:45:55.042
I swear to you,
I will find the evidence.

1:45:56.042 --> 1:45:57.292
Believe me.

1:46:04.208 --> 1:46:05.833
Walt. It's over.

1:46:07.625 --> 1:46:09.208
It's over.

1:46:13.958 --> 1:46:15.500
Yes...

1:46:17.083 --> 1:46:18.833
it's over.

1:46:22.958 --> 1:46:25.083
I'm all done.

1:46:39.083 --> 1:46:41.667
It's me they want.
It's always been me.

1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.917
Come outside!
Come out with your hands up!

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.833
Come here, Spezi, come here.

1:46:56.583 --> 1:46:58.375
Keep coming.

1:46:58.625 --> 1:47:01.125
Keep coming. Come...
Hold it!

1:47:04.708 --> 1:47:06.333
Cuff him, Ricciardi.

1:47:08.667 --> 1:47:10.667
Stop. Drop your weapon!

1:47:12.667 --> 1:47:14.500
Drop your weapon, Walter!

1:47:15.750 --> 1:47:17.708
Drop your weapon!

1:48:32.167 --> 1:48:33.417
Oxycodone.

1:48:38.792 --> 1:48:41.125
- Wine!
- OK, calm down, guys!

1:48:41.250 --> 1:48:42.958
Calm down. OK?

1:48:45.750 --> 1:48:47.500
No, I want wine!

1:49:09.042 --> 1:49:12.208
- Enough, enough.
- More, more... a little more, yes.

1:51:05.375 --> 1:51:06.875
It's sad that a community

1:51:07.792 --> 1:51:09.958
is united only in times of tragedy.

1:51:12.583 --> 1:51:14.708
It's sad when human beings

1:51:15.125 --> 1:51:17.333
will only step outside
their fortresses

1:51:17.750 --> 1:51:19.750
to share their grief,

1:51:20.417 --> 1:51:22.500
to admit their fear.

1:51:24.250 --> 1:51:25.333
It's sad.
