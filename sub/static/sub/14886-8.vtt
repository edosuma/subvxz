This little baby
speaks me Myposian!

01:49.342 --> 01:51.712
I just told him to, drink
his bottle, cry a little

01:51.745 --> 01:55.782
and let the milk dribble down
his chin and he did it.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.917
Now, you sure you don't mind

01:56.950 --> 01:57.851

for the weekend?

Do you think
it will be okay with Larry?

Well, of course, I do.
Don't be ridiculous.

It's little Frankie.

How's it goin', pal? Huh?

Gina, what's the problem?

02:32.519 --> 02:34.521
Well, look, you know
that Steve's a truck driver

02:34.555 --> 02:37.390
and he's gone a week,
sometimes two weeks at a time.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.860
When we're apart, he misses me.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.296
Well, of course, he misses you.
That's natural.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.366
No, I mean, he really misses me.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.675
You know..
You know what I think?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.877
I think that all
Gina and Steve need

02:56.910 --> 02:59.680
is some time alone
away from the baby.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.783
Well, Balki, you're right.
I think that's a wonderful idea.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.851
I'm glad you said that.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.991

you said it first.

it would be nice if sometime

we take the baby
with us so that

03:31.645 --> 03:34.515

could have some time alone.

‐ Of course not.

14:28.001 --> 14:31.271
You know, the park's
a totally different place

14:31.304 --> 14:33.139
when you have a child with you.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.410
And taking Frankie
along was fun too.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.614
Too bad
we didn't know last night

14:40.647 --> 14:43.383
that he likes
to sleep in the park.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.386
Did you notice how perky he was
when he woke up from his nap?

14:46.419 --> 14:51.592
Most babies take a little while
to adjust but not our Frankie.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.994
And he smiled at everyone
who looked into his carriage.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.228
Mm‐hmm.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.930
Yeah, I think the other parents

14:56.963 --> 14:58.599
were a little jealous,
don't you?

14:58.632 --> 15:02.636
Well, of course they were.
We had the best baby.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.371
Did you notice
how nervous some of them were?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.308
I don't think they've had any
experience with babies at all.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.644
Heh! I don't know
what the big fuss is.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.914
After all, what's a baby but
a short adult in plastic pants?

That's an I'm wet
and uncomfortable cry.

[humming]

15:37.704 --> 15:40.674
‐ Cousin?
‐ Hmm?

15:40.707 --> 15:43.309
The last time you‐you
changed Little Frankie

15:43.343 --> 15:46.212
was he a little boy
or a little girl?

15:57.558 --> 16:00.561
What are you talking about?
He's a boy.

16:00.594 --> 16:02.395
Well, we gotta talk about that.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.535
This baby is a girl.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.676
That's not possible.

16:17.578 --> 16:21.014
It is possible if we took the
wrong baby home from the park.

16:22.448 --> 16:23.717
Look for yourself.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.390
Oh, my Lord!

16:32.593 --> 16:36.362
That's, uh.. Whoa, that's..

16:36.396 --> 16:38.331
...that's not a boy.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.802
I just said that.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.804
How could something
like this happen?

16:43.837 --> 16:46.106
Well, maybe it happened
during the puppet show.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.074
There were so many carriages
just like Frankie's

16:48.108 --> 16:49.442
and you didn't notice
you took the wrong carriage.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.377
I took the wrong carriage?

16:51.411 --> 16:54.515
Well, I couldn't be
pushing the carriage.

16:54.548 --> 16:55.448
I was getting the balloons.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.451
Well, you're the one
who wanted the balloons.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.053
Well, they were for Frankie.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.823
Well, they're not
for Frankie now.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.790
‐ What are we going to do?
‐ Alright, alright.

17:04.825 --> 17:07.393
We'll go back to the park
and look for Frankie.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.596
Wait a minute.
I got it.

17:09.630 --> 17:12.365
We go back to the park
and look for Frankie.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.200
Right!

Wait a minute.
What if he's not there?

Oh, my God!

17:19.705 --> 17:21.174
What if he's not there?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.082
‐ You did it.
‐ I didn't leave the baby.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.684
You left the baby.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.690
‐ You left the door open.

I can't believe
we couldn't find the baby.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.249
I can't believe Gina's
going to be here any minute

18:03.283 --> 18:06.452
and we have to tell her
we couldn't find the baby.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.693
Frankie? Frankie?

18:12.726 --> 18:15.195
Well, what do you think,
he came home on his own?

18:19.833 --> 18:23.770
Frankie? Frankie?

18:23.804 --> 18:26.873
Alright, we told
everyone at the park.

18:26.907 --> 18:28.842
We called the police,
we called the newspapers.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.443
Is there anything else
we should have done?

18:30.476 --> 18:32.613
Well, how should I know?
I've never lost a baby before.

18:32.646 --> 18:35.281
Alright, you need,
you need to calm down.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.817
Calm down.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.422
The people who took Frankie
by mistake will realize

18:42.455 --> 18:44.758
they made a mistake
and they'll bring him back here.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.859
‐ Do you think so?
‐ Yes.

18:45.892 --> 18:46.860
Oh!

18:46.893 --> 18:48.595
Unless..

18:49.796 --> 18:51.798
...they're the ones that owned

18:51.832 --> 18:55.368
the Winnebago
we saw at the park.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.671
They could be half way across
the state before they realize

18:57.704 --> 18:58.872
they took the wrong baby.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.708
Why did you have to say that?

19:01.742 --> 19:04.377
Did I say that?

19:04.410 --> 19:07.347
We have to get Frankie back
before Gina get's here.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.515
[knock on door]

19:09.716 --> 19:12.519
(together)
Gina!

19:12.553 --> 19:15.956
‐ What are we going to do?
‐ No problem, we're not here.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.423
But we are here.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.292
She won't know that
if we don't answer.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.961
In a little while she will go
away and in a couple of days

19:20.994 --> 19:23.296
we'll call her and tell her
to come and get Frankie.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.632
[chuckles]
You are kidding, aren't you?

19:25.666 --> 19:26.700
Well, what do you suggest we do?

19:26.733 --> 19:28.368
I suggest we tell her the truth.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.470
Oh, oh, that's just fine.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.405
And when she asks how
everything went we just say

19:32.438 --> 19:34.808
"Oh‐ho, smooth as silk with one
slight hitch, we lost the baby.

the door for her‐‐

‐ Oh, yes, I do.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.295
Hi! How's my little Frankie?

19:55.328 --> 19:58.398
Oh, shh! Shh! Asleep, asleep!
We'll go over here.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.701
[laughing]

20:00.734 --> 20:02.869
Oh, well, I certainly hope
he wasn't too much trouble.

20:02.903 --> 20:05.338
Well, everything
was alright until today.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.241
And then we took
Frankie to the park.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.644
And all we wanted, we‐we meant
for him to have a good time‐‐

20:10.677 --> 20:13.714
What Balki is trying to say is
that we were having so much fun

20:13.747 --> 20:17.651
with Frankie that we‐we‐we
hate to see him go.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.858

a balloon for‐for Frankie

20:24.891 --> 20:26.560
and‐and‐and I thought‐‐

20:26.593 --> 20:28.729
He thought, he thought
that I wanted a balloon.

20:28.762 --> 20:30.296
Why would I want a balloon?

20:30.330 --> 20:32.933
But enough about us.
How was your weekend?

20:32.966 --> 20:35.435
Well, it was wonderful,
very romantic.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.038
Steve and I worked out
a lot of problems.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.940
We decided that when Frankie
get's a little older

20:39.973 --> 20:42.008
we're going to have
another baby.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.343
Maybe we'll have
a girl next time.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.579
Maybe sooner than you think.

20:48.749 --> 20:51.451
Gina, this is not easy.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.955
But...we have
something to tell you.

20:54.988 --> 20:55.989
You have to know that‐‐

20:56.022 --> 20:59.760
That you look terrible.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.562
‐ I do?
‐ She does not.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.530
Yes, she does.
Oh, yes, you do.

21:03.564 --> 21:06.332
I know you've been on the road
18 hours but you don't want

21:06.366 --> 21:08.935
Frankie to see
you until you freshen up.

21:08.969 --> 21:10.671
You'll scare
the dickens out of him!

21:10.704 --> 21:12.573
Yeah, but Steve
is waiting in the truck.

21:12.606 --> 21:15.341
Well, he can wait. You take
all the time you need.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.610
The baby will be here
when you get out.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.753
When I discovered
I took the wrong baby

21:59.786 --> 22:01.655
I was almost
out of my mind with worry.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.891
Oh, he was worried.
I'm just out of my mind.

22:04.925 --> 22:08.428
I went to the park and some
people told me to come here.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.130
Thank you so much
for taking care of her.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.932
Thank you, for taking care
of Frankie.

22:11.965 --> 22:14.467
Oh, well, I‐I better be going.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.438
My husband has a Winnebago
double‐parked out front.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.940
I'd love to hear more
about your trip but, uh

22:19.973 --> 22:21.074
I don't want you
to get a ticket.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.108
Uh, glad you dropped by.

See you again some other time.

Gina the truth.

this is little Frankie?

22:46.833 --> 22:49.035
There's one way to be sure.

‐ Oh. Oh, yeah.
‐ Yes, yes.

I kind of enjoyed
having Frankie around.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.795
Of course for the last few
hours, he wasn't around.

23:52.032 --> 23:54.968
It makes you realize what a lot
of work it is being a mother.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.470
Oh, yeah, my mother
had to raise nine of us.

23:59.039 --> 24:01.174
You know, tomorrow
I'm going to go buy a present

24:01.207 --> 24:03.677
for my mama to say thank you.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.979
Well, that's a good idea.

I think I'll send
my mother some flowers.

can't take care of themselves.

was a handful.
