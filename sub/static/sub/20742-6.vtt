SONYA:
I understand you.

00:08.386 --> 00:10.148
You had sex

Yes.

01:02.513 --> 01:04.412
You could've fooled me.

01:05.325 --> 01:07.875
I've been married to an older man,
remember?

01:07.879 --> 01:10.677

What was that like?

01:11.522 --> 01:13.196

No.

Karl had other talents.

01:21.369 --> 01:24.887
RAY: Yeah, serious coin
to own a spread like this.

01:27.051 --> 01:29.168
CHARLOTTE:
That's not it.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.340

I didn't mean anything.

CHARLOTTE:

He's not a narco.

- What story is he telling?
- MARCO: (Speaking Spanish)

04:05.314 --> 04:08.933
COOPER: I put a patrol on every street
within a three-mile radius, boss.

04:08.968 --> 04:11.240
He pulled a Houdini.
We got nothing.

Yes.

No.

I need specifics.

MARCO: It's okay.
You're gonna be safer there.

05:21.371 --> 05:23.707
You should pack your bag.

05:24.010 --> 05:26.508
(Phone ringing)

05:28.605 --> 05:31.110
MARCO: Made a mistake
leaving that car at the scene.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.071
Is that a real police cruiser?

05:34.146 --> 05:36.749
COOPER: No, guy must have bought
an '02 Crown Vic at auction,

05:36.784 --> 05:39.917
tricked it up to look like one.
The lab's all over it.

05:40.606 --> 05:43.558

Not while she's here.

05:44.332 --> 05:45.628

You're welcome.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.220
MARCO:
<i>Exactamente.</i>

06:00.929 --> 06:03.785
SONYA: Gina heard her father
talking to someone before the murder.

06:04.015 --> 06:07.076
WADE: And you're thinking that
the killer was a patient, right?

06:08.008 --> 06:09.374
SONYA:
Maybe.

06:09.457 --> 06:12.250
MARCO: Well, Dr. Meadows
saw a lot of cops.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.231
WADE:
Makes sense.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.258
He was a network provider
for the health plan.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.146
He saw a lot of El Paso PD,
DEA, FBI patients.

06:20.181 --> 06:22.281

cop psychiatrist.

06:22.283 --> 06:24.697

what do you say

06:24.775 --> 06:28.703
we all keep this law enforcement angle

06:28.738 --> 06:31.173
- COOPER: Yes, sir.
- MARCO: Sure.

06:31.897 --> 06:33.301
WADE:
How's she holding up?

06:33.338 --> 06:34.960
SONYA:
She's a bad eyewitness.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.805
I'm not getting anything
from her.

06:36.923 --> 06:38.167
WADE: Well, Sonya,
she's 15 years old

06:38.286 --> 06:41.372
and she just lost her father.
Go gentle.

06:41.844 --> 06:44.563
- Okay?
- SONYA: I got her breakfast.

06:44.698 --> 06:46.592
WADE:
Good thinking.

06:47.610 --> 06:49.271
SONYA:
Here you go.

06:52.911 --> 06:55.161
GINA:
I don't think I can eat.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.896
SONYA: Would you like
a glass of water?

07:03.103 --> 07:04.650
GINA:
That's okay.

07:05.155 --> 07:06.698
SONYA:
Okay.

07:06.733 --> 07:10.822
Take a look at these.
Tell me if he's one of them.

07:38.540 --> 07:39.647

No.

07:39.682 --> 07:41.620
SONYA:
Try again.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.945
- Please.
- GINA: He's not there.

07:47.822 --> 07:49.485
SONYA:
Maybe if you ate something.

07:50.154 --> 07:52.198
GINA:
Can I have a cigarette?

07:54.530 --> 07:56.997

- GINA: No.

07:57.429 --> 07:59.318

then shows up in lost and found

Same move I would've done.

No.

13:38.416 --> 13:40.366
How's it going with Gina?

13:40.376 --> 13:42.362
SONYA:
She can't remember anything.

13:42.869 --> 13:44.859
MARCO:
She's been through hell.

13:46.103 --> 13:47.894
SONYA:
The cut...

13:48.136 --> 13:51.700
The Colombian necktie...
Maybe her father was into drugs?

13:51.735 --> 13:54.323
MARCO: I already checked.
He's clean.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.987
Have you tried talking
about something else with Gina?

14:01.297 --> 14:04.337
- SONYA: Why would I do that?
- MARCO: To get her to trust you.

14:04.372 --> 14:07.715
SONYA: She trusts me.
I'm a cop.

- WADE: And, uh, you found me...

14:53.578 --> 14:55.935

- You want to know why?
- MARCO: If you want to tell me.

15:19.206 --> 15:23.341
WADE: Everybody has
their own case that costs.

15:23.376 --> 15:26.532
MARCO:
Yeah... I have many.

15:26.567 --> 15:30.282
WADE: This one was a girl.
18 years old.

15:30.317 --> 15:33.449
Found her in a ditch.
She'd been raped and beated and...

15:38.429 --> 15:41.409
What this guy did to her was...

15:43.980 --> 15:46.093
Anyway, I caught the case,

15:47.584 --> 15:51.769
and the mother was out the picture,
her father was missing in action.

15:53.330 --> 15:57.297
So... the girl's little sister
came to I.D. the body.

15:57.412 --> 16:00.219
She was 15 years old
having to do that.

16:01.603 --> 16:03.058
MARCO:
You get the guy?

16:03.148 --> 16:05.936
WADE: Yeah, it was a truck driver.
His name was Jim Dobbs.

16:05.971 --> 16:07.271
He looked really good for it.

16:07.388 --> 16:10.484
I chased him to a motel
half a mile from the border.

16:10.695 --> 16:12.368
And if you read the report,

16:12.409 --> 16:15.784
it'll tell you that he reached
for a gun on the night stand.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.481
Reports are funny things.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.843
MARCO:
You took him down?

16:20.878 --> 16:22.689
WADE:
Yes, well...

16:22.736 --> 16:24.793
I put a bullet
right in his brain pan,

16:24.881 --> 16:26.523
but it didn't kill him.

16:26.596 --> 16:29.131
No, it went "pshoo"!

16:29.567 --> 16:33.125
So now he's got three hots and a cot,
courtesy of the state.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.270
Course he doesn't know
what day it is.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.557
MARCO: So they sent you
to the shrink.

16:38.703 --> 16:41.339
WADE:
No, I sent me to the shrink.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.066
I was having a hard time
with what I done.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.344
MARCO:
He deserved it.

16:46.466 --> 16:47.667
WADE:
No, not Dobbs.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.830
I could give a rat's ass
what I did to that asshole.

16:49.903 --> 16:54.477
I was troubled with what...
what I did to the little sister.

16:55.494 --> 16:58.940
See, I took away any hope
she had of getting answers.

17:04.730 --> 17:09.265
- MARCO: Her.
- WADE: Sonya. Yep.

17:10.093 --> 17:13.083
And I'd appreciate
you keeping this between us.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.871
Yeah. Thank you.

17:21.838 --> 17:23.417
MARCO: (Sniffs)
Yeah.

17:28.587 --> 17:31.406
GRACIELA: You're too skinny.
Men don't like them too skinny.

17:31.517 --> 17:34.991
- RAY: I like her just fine.
- GRACIELA: Monte.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.334
MONTE: I like women
in all of their forms.

17:37.527 --> 17:39.659
GRACIELA: What's the point
of this meeting?

17:40.373 --> 17:41.378
CHARLOTTE:
My partner and I

17:41.486 --> 17:43.778
would like to make some changes
in the arrangements.

17:43.851 --> 17:46.322
- GRACIELA: Your "partner"?
- RAY: Ray.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.077
CHARLOTTE:
From now on...

17:48.151 --> 17:49.981
I don't know anything
about the tunnel.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.966
For everything...
and I mean everything...

17:53.087 --> 17:56.560
- you deal with Ray.
- GRACIELA: And who is Ray?

17:57.103 --> 17:59.280
RAY: I'm the guy
you're dealing with.

17:59.655 --> 18:02.539
Seriously, I'm reliable.

18:02.859 --> 18:05.750
Truth be told,
it's not my first dope rodeo.

18:05.874 --> 18:08.960
MONTE: Miss Rivera has no involvement
in narcotics of any kind.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.246
RAY:
Ea-Ea-Easy there, Tex.

18:12.031 --> 18:14.714
I'm really good at moving things
from here to there.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.006
You know what I mean?

18:23.685 --> 18:27.627
MONTE: Name, date of birth,
Social Security number.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.316
If everything checks out

18:32.402 --> 18:36.490
it will be just like it was with Karl...
but with Ray.

18:38.778 --> 18:40.681
RAY:
Nice doing business with you.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.863
GRACIELA:
We'll see.

18:44.596 --> 18:47.020
RAY:
<i>Adiós, muchachos.</i>

18:48.684 --> 18:50.689
MONTE:
He kept my pen.

19:25.245 --> 19:27.312
SONYA:
A sketch artist is coming.

19:28.444 --> 19:30.167
GINA:
Great.

19:31.644 --> 19:35.299
SONYA: Gina, it's important
that you try.

19:35.412 --> 19:36.669
(Marco taps on glass door)

19:36.704 --> 19:38.816
MARCO: They want you
in the the garage.

19:38.851 --> 19:42.092
Trujillo's having trouble
getting the VIN number off the car.

19:42.327 --> 19:45.750
SONYA: The killer's way too careful.
He's not gonna find anything.

19:45.887 --> 19:48.385
MARCO:
He still wants to talk to you.

19:58.928 --> 20:01.103
MARCO:
How are you holding up?

20:03.216 --> 20:05.361
GINA: (Voice breaks)
I don't know.

20:07.135 --> 20:10.022
I can't remember.
It's...

20:11.296 --> 20:14.517
It's like it was a really
messed-up dream or something.

20:14.633 --> 20:17.757
MARCO:
Yeah. I believe you.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.304
GINA:
You smoke?

20:24.656 --> 20:26.842
MARCO:
Yep, sometimes.

20:27.091 --> 20:29.165
GINA:
Can I have one?

20:29.976 --> 20:31.495
MARCO:
It's bad for you.

20:31.617 --> 20:36.066
GINA:
I know. Please.

20:39.183 --> 20:40.535
MARCO:
One.

20:40.644 --> 20:43.319
But you can't tell my partner
where you got it, all right?

20:43.353 --> 20:44.556
(Gina chuckles)

20:44.591 --> 20:46.891
GINA:
Yeah, she's, uh...

20:49.153 --> 20:50.108
(Chuckles)

20:50.142 --> 20:51.938
She's pretty intense.

20:52.016 --> 20:53.981
MARCO:
Yeah, she is.

20:54.093 --> 20:55.855
Deal?

20:56.663 --> 20:58.842
GINA:
Yes.

21:18.522 --> 21:20.518
FRYE: What's up with all
this spy-versus-spy bullshit?

21:20.598 --> 21:22.250
ADRIANA: Look,
if we keep asking questions

21:22.326 --> 21:24.372
about the Death House,
we're gonna end up in a scary place.

21:24.444 --> 21:26.307
FRYE: That's what we do.
We ask questions.

21:26.377 --> 21:28.845
- ADRIANA: It's different down here.
- FRYE: No shit, Sherlock. Ow!

21:28.906 --> 21:31.044
- ADRIANA: The Calle Parsonieros house?
- FRYE: Uh-huh?

21:31.189 --> 21:33.526
ADRIANA: Cristina was throw in there
with 22 other bodies.

21:33.561 --> 21:34.614
FRYE:
Yeah.

21:34.792 --> 21:37.495
ADRIANA: There was another body
in the house... Rafa Galvan.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.041
FRYE:
Fausto's brother?

21:39.085 --> 21:40.696
ADRIANA: Yeah.
There is no way he could admit

21:40.784 --> 21:43.203
his brother had been killed,
so he made it all disappear.

21:43.238 --> 21:44.243
FRYE:
How'd he do that?

21:44.357 --> 21:45.420
ADRIANA:
With the help of the police.

21:45.489 --> 21:48.092
Specifically, one Chihuahua
State Police detective.

21:48.202 --> 21:49.618
(Frye snorts)

21:49.701 --> 21:51.465
- FRYE: Marco Ruiz?
- ADRIANA: You tell me.

21:51.503 --> 21:53.965
He was assigned the case
and the case disappeared.

21:54.045 --> 21:57.133
FRYE: And that,
that brings us back to Fausto.

21:57.168 --> 21:59.358
ADRIANA: Which is what
I wanted to show you.

22:05.568 --> 22:08.383
FRYE:
Oh... my God.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.256
ADRIANA: This is what Fausto does
to a <i>sicario that pisses him off.</i>

22:13.840 --> 22:15.088
What do you think
he'll do to you

22:15.123 --> 22:17.386
if he finds out
you're asking questions?

22:17.421 --> 22:19.366
FRYE:
Why don't they cut him down?

22:20.498 --> 22:22.750
ADRIANA:
They're afraid of Fausto.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.120
FRYE: I'm not afraid.
Are you?

22:29.507 --> 22:31.621
ADRIANA:
Yeah, I am.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.617
FRYE: You still want to work
the story?

22:34.978 --> 22:37.053
ADRIANA:
Hell, yeah.

22:37.784 --> 22:39.647
FRYE:
Good.

22:44.352 --> 22:46.143
Give me your phone.

22:51.452 --> 22:54.428
SONYA: What about his cheeks?
Full? Hollow?

22:54.494 --> 22:56.340
GINA:
I don't know.

22:57.091 --> 23:00.648
It was dark. I was hiding.
I only saw him for a second.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.412
SONYA: How about his hair?
Long? Short?

23:02.414 --> 23:04.447
GINA: Look, I don't know!
All right?

23:04.449 --> 23:07.136
I don't know. I don't.

23:07.171 --> 23:09.018
It was so fast
and I was so scared,

23:09.020 --> 23:10.351
I can't remember.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.102
MARCO: I think we should
take a break.

23:12.262 --> 23:13.983
SONYA:
Okay.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.819
MARCO:
Go on.

23:20.821 --> 23:22.656
MARCO:
You can't push her like that.

23:22.737 --> 23:25.576
She saw something terrible.
Something she'll never forget.

23:25.647 --> 23:28.498
SONYA: I know,
but she has to remember his face.

23:28.647 --> 23:31.065
COOPER: Sorry,
Gina's mother is here.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.160
- SONYA: Oh, good.
- COOPER: Not necessarily.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.448
She's with Hank.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.311
WADE: Mrs. Meadows,
this is Detective Cross

23:45.386 --> 23:47.882
and Detective Ruiz.
They've been talking to Gina.

23:47.921 --> 23:50.102
- MRS. MEADOWS: How is she?
- MARCO: Oh, she's fine.

23:50.117 --> 23:52.350
She's helping us identify
your husband's killer.

23:52.421 --> 23:55.963
MRS. MEADOWS: Ex-husband.
I'm-I'm gonna take Gina home.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.931
WADE: Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

24:00.966 --> 24:02.487
MRS. MEADOWS:
What are you talking about?

24:02.522 --> 24:04.672
- SONYA: You're on drugs.
- (Marco scoffs)

24:04.707 --> 24:07.064
MARCO: What she means is
that Gina's safer here with us.

24:07.157 --> 24:08.670
SONYA: You're supposed
to take care of your daughter.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.388
WADE: (Firmly)
Sonya...

24:13.775 --> 24:15.467
SONYA:
Oxycontin?

24:21.298 --> 24:23.161
WADE:
Are you using, ma'am?

24:28.620 --> 24:30.566
SONYA: Your husband
couldn't get you help?

24:31.684 --> 24:33.183
MRS. MEADOWS:
Help?

24:33.682 --> 24:36.781
Peter gave me
my first prescription for oxy.

24:36.816 --> 24:39.808
MARCO: Did he write prescriptions
for other people?

24:41.310 --> 24:43.973
MRS. MEADOWS: Isn't that
what this is all about?

24:44.679 --> 24:46.226
That house didn't get paid for

24:46.263 --> 24:49.466
by doing contract work
for the county health plan.

24:50.555 --> 24:53.335
SONYA:
Okay, Meadows sells drugs,

24:53.724 --> 24:55.907
so he's killed like a narco.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.926
Gedman uses prostitutes,

24:59.418 --> 25:01.254
so he's beheaded.

25:01.545 --> 25:03.901
Illegals poisoned.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.578
A judge and a prostitute
bisected.

25:06.613 --> 25:07.989
WADE:
It's all over the place.

25:08.024 --> 25:10.490
It's personal, it's political.
It doesn't make any sense.

25:10.525 --> 25:13.336
SONYA: It does.
It does to him.

25:17.461 --> 25:19.185
Maybe Gina knew
what her father was into..

25:19.217 --> 25:21.681
- MARCO: Not now, Sonya.
- WADE: Marco's right.

25:21.816 --> 25:24.465
If you press her now,
you're not gonna get anything.

25:26.179 --> 25:28.817
Burgers, chili, onions...

25:28.859 --> 25:30.452
heartburn...
Come on, my treat.

25:30.585 --> 25:31.739
SONYA: We don't have time
to eat, Hank.

25:31.774 --> 25:34.238
WADE: Yes, we do, Sonya.
Yes, we do.

25:34.273 --> 25:35.593
Marco, you coming?

25:35.628 --> 25:37.815
MARCO: I got to take care
of something at home.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.570
(Phone ringing)

25:53.037 --> 25:55.119
KENNETH: Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to answer that.

25:57.104 --> 25:58.646
ALMA:
For now, I'll talk later.

26:00.411 --> 26:02.090
KENNETH:
Cheers to that.

26:04.211 --> 26:07.105
(Phone ringing)

26:11.343 --> 26:13.009
It gets better...

26:14.631 --> 26:17.557
I mean, the end is always tough,
but then...

26:18.751 --> 26:20.694
you move on.

26:21.526 --> 26:23.741
Time passes.

26:24.903 --> 26:26.976
And you just end up...

26:28.877 --> 26:30.084
different.

26:30.210 --> 26:32.706
ALMA: But I don't know
if different's what I want.

26:34.732 --> 26:36.627
KENNETH:
Well, you'll figure it out.

26:37.313 --> 26:39.255
And just give yourself time.

26:41.650 --> 26:43.366
ALMA:
Yeah.

26:44.042 --> 26:45.627
Thank you.

26:49.488 --> 26:51.737
(Alma sighs)

26:51.857 --> 26:53.677
This feels so nice.

26:59.264 --> 27:03.348
KENNETH:
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:03.383 --> 27:06.269
ALMA: No, it's-it's okay.
(They clear their throats)

27:09.070 --> 27:12.154
It-it really helps me
to talk to somebody.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.446
WADE:
Pretty damn good, isn't it?

27:20.086 --> 27:21.740
GINA:
Really.

27:21.872 --> 27:23.619
SONYA:
I don't like burgers.

27:24.856 --> 27:26.723
WADE:
Well, that's Un-American.

27:27.178 --> 27:29.381
Eat your freedom fries.

27:32.376 --> 27:34.188
GINA: Did you get a hold
of my mom?

27:34.269 --> 27:35.494
WADE:
We did.

27:37.776 --> 27:39.440
GINA:
So, she's picking me up?

27:41.761 --> 27:43.346
WADE: Honey, I don't think
going home with your mom

27:43.453 --> 27:45.778
is the best thing for you
right now.

27:46.614 --> 27:50.650
GINA: Yeah.
She's got her problems.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.678
SONYA:
My mom was like that.

27:54.490 --> 27:55.926
GINA:
Really?

27:56.355 --> 27:57.680
SONYA:
Yup.

27:57.714 --> 28:00.808
Her thing was cocaine.
And men.

28:04.868 --> 28:07.058
WADE:
Your mom can get clean.

28:08.619 --> 28:10.141
GINA:
She's tried.

28:10.217 --> 28:12.571
WADE: Well, we'll gonna help her
try again.

28:14.575 --> 28:17.106
Hey, if you're not gonna eat that,
I will.

28:18.917 --> 28:20.443
GINA: I need to go
to the bathroom.

28:20.518 --> 28:22.313
WADE:
Of course.

28:29.486 --> 28:31.600
SONYA:
Her mom's not gonna get clean.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.394
She's going to Social Services
till she's 18.

28:39.429 --> 28:42.348
WADE: Well, there are different ways
to coat that pill, Sonya.

28:43.893 --> 28:46.109
SONYA:
I hated Social Services.

28:46.332 --> 28:48.925
WADE: Well, you didn't turn out
too bad, did you?

29:02.733 --> 29:04.282
Excuse me.

29:06.185 --> 29:07.972
Gina?

29:12.090 --> 29:13.640
Gina!

29:14.303 --> 29:15.780
Hank!

29:41.373 --> 29:43.556
WADE:
Hey, Gina!

29:54.511 --> 29:57.228
Female, Caucasian,
15 years old,

29:57.336 --> 30:00.577
black and white sweater,
blue jeans, brown shoes...

30:01.707 --> 30:04.168
in the vicinity
of Missouri Avenue.

30:05.277 --> 30:06.955
(Panting)

30:10.661 --> 30:12.143
WADE:
Hey, Sonya!

30:22.190 --> 30:23.797
Gina!

30:24.483 --> 30:27.982
(Woman screaming)

30:36.700 --> 30:38.287
SONYA:
Gina.

30:40.669 --> 30:42.335
Gina.

30:42.586 --> 30:44.818
- Gina! No!
- (Gina crying)

30:44.853 --> 30:45.980
Hank!

30:46.212 --> 30:49.025
Okay, just hold on.
Hold on.

30:49.060 --> 30:50.617
GINA:
It was him.

30:50.742 --> 30:52.395
(Gina struggling to speak)

30:55.582 --> 31:00.802
Am-am-am I gonna die?

31:01.220 --> 31:03.365
SONYA:
You just hang on for me.

31:03.566 --> 31:05.258
Shh...

31:07.813 --> 31:10.996
- Shh...
- (Gina gasping)

31:12.281 --> 31:17.160
GINA:
I... I-I got the eyes right.

31:23.314 --> 31:26.088
SONYA: No, n-n-no, no!
No, no!

31:28.830 --> 31:31.187
(Sonya groans)

31:41.952 --> 31:44.730
SONYA:
Help. Help me.

31:46.855 --> 31:51.681
(Grunting, gasping loudly)

31:51.816 --> 31:54.638
WADE:
Shh... Okay... Shh...

31:58.248 --> 32:00.905
SONYA:
Don't touch me!

32:52.087 --> 32:53.873
(Marco sighs)

33:52.162 --> 33:53.657
(Sighs)

33:55.255 --> 33:56.935
MARCO:
Okay.

34:31.085 --> 34:36.224
(Phone ringing)

34:37.190 --> 34:38.031
Hey.

34:38.148 --> 34:39.862
SONYA:
Gina's dead.

34:40.021 --> 34:42.025
She ran from the restaurant,
and he got her.

34:44.427 --> 34:46.498
MARCO: Who else knew
she was with us?

34:46.527 --> 34:47.690
SONYA:
Nobody.

34:48.098 --> 34:50.070
Her mother, the FBI,

34:50.529 --> 34:51.487
our people.

34:55.621 --> 34:57.285
MARCO:
He's watching us.

34:57.517 --> 34:59.313
Are you all right?

35:00.975 --> 35:04.121
(Sonya panting)

35:08.344 --> 35:11.403
SONYA:
Yes. I'm fine.

35:34.210 --> 35:36.181
ADRIANA:
Figured I'd find you here.

35:37.768 --> 35:40.371
Are we following the story
or drinking the day away?

35:40.584 --> 35:42.282
FRYE:
I...

35:42.707 --> 35:44.892
am drinking club soda,

35:45.815 --> 35:49.783
because I am 48... oh!

35:50.583 --> 35:56.207
Excuse me,
I am now 51 hours sober.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.523
(Frye clicks tongue)

35:58.668 --> 36:00.818
Here's to the next ten minutes.

36:01.328 --> 36:02.976
ADRIANA:
Good for you.

36:03.322 --> 36:06.357
FRYE: Oh, yeah,
I deserve a merit badge.

36:06.607 --> 36:08.670
Let's just work the story, huh.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.065
ADRIANA:
Okay.

36:12.844 --> 36:14.196
So, the killer dumps

36:14.270 --> 36:16.348
half of Cristina Fuentes
in a Death House.

36:16.491 --> 36:19.728
FRYE: And Marco Ruiz
is the lead investigator,

36:19.863 --> 36:23.488
but the case gets buried.

36:25.129 --> 36:27.194
ADRIANA: It doesn't feel
like a coincidence.

36:27.962 --> 36:31.940
FRYE: The killer,
he wants us to know...

36:32.521 --> 36:35.535
that Marco's dirty, right?

36:37.941 --> 36:39.805
ADRIANA:
Maybe.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.281
(Phone rings)

36:50.425 --> 36:53.235
RAY: Ah, Timbo.
Right on time.

36:53.270 --> 36:54.680
TIM:
You know me, Ray.

36:54.715 --> 36:56.623
Clockwork when it comes
to business.

36:56.658 --> 36:58.138
How's Texas?

36:58.465 --> 36:59.947
RAY:
Interesting.

36:59.982 --> 37:01.807
TIM:
And Charlotte?

37:01.878 --> 37:04.524
RAY:
Smoking hot, horny.

37:05.172 --> 37:06.561
(Chuckles)
It's rough, dude.

37:06.668 --> 37:08.537
TIM:
Oh, yeah, sounds it.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.602
So, what's up?

37:12.636 --> 37:15.421
RAY: I want to get something
going down here.

37:15.456 --> 37:16.889
TIM:
Yeah...

37:16.925 --> 37:18.508
RAY:
You know what I mean?

37:18.582 --> 37:20.450
TIM:
I do.

37:20.566 --> 37:22.940
RAY: Think you could set me up
with 50 to start?

37:23.967 --> 37:26.085
TIM: Oh... Yeah, I don't...
I don't know.

37:26.490 --> 37:28.750
RAY: I thought you said
you were the man in Tampa.

37:28.785 --> 37:31.070
- TIM: I am.
- RAY: So?

37:31.105 --> 37:33.253
TIM: It's gonna take me
a couple of days.

37:33.288 --> 37:35.016
RAY:
Sweet.

37:35.051 --> 37:37.113
TIM: All right, take it easy, Ray,
or don't take it at all.

37:37.148 --> 37:39.401
- Later.
- RAY: Later.

37:44.489 --> 37:45.969
ATF AGENT:
Good job, Timmy.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.886
Snitching suits you.

37:49.449 --> 37:51.602
TIM: You got what you want.
I'm good, right?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.892
ATF AGENT:
Oh, no, bud.

37:53.996 --> 37:56.459
We are just getting started.

38:26.460 --> 38:28.519
(Lock buzzes)

38:47.906 --> 38:49.563
FAUSTO:
Marco Ruiz.

39:14.454 --> 39:16.073
MARCO:
Faustón...
