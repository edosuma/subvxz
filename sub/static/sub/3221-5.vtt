00:03.625 --> 00:06.329
They turned me.
Made those fangs.

00:06.628 --> 00:08.786
She bit me in the neck.
Bite doesn't work.

00:08.963 --> 00:11.633
You have to actually ingest the blood
to be infected.

00:11.799 --> 00:13.128
Vampire blood he dosed you with.

00:13.301 --> 00:14.546
- What?
- Lights too bright?

00:14.719 --> 00:18.468
Sunshine hurt your skin?
I get so hungry.

00:19.182 --> 00:20.641
What you been doing? Hunting.

00:20.808 --> 00:21.971
Hooked up with others.

00:22.143 --> 00:24.681
You working with strangers?
More like family.

00:24.854 --> 00:25.969
I'm your grandfather.

00:26.147 --> 00:29.148
Stick around, I'll show you tricks
your daddy never dreamed of.

00:30.109 --> 00:32.731
I can't just lose you and Ben.

00:32.904 --> 00:35.774
Me and Ben will be here,
and you come when you can.

00:35.949 --> 00:37.906
Just come in one piece.

00:38.284 --> 00:40.954
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.446
There's been a few times
you've got me wondering.

00:43.623 --> 00:46.244
It's Sam, Bobby. He's different.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.704
Something's not right to me.

00:58.137 --> 01:01.756
<i>White on white
Translucent black capes</i>

01:02.725 --> 01:04.552
<i>Back on the rack</i>

01:09.816 --> 01:11.773
<i>Bela Lugosi's dead</i>

01:11.943 --> 01:15.063
<i>The bats have fled the bell tower</i>

01:15.238 --> 01:17.277
<i>The victims have been bled</i>

01:17.448 --> 01:20.983
<i>Red velvet lines the black box</i>

01:22.745 --> 01:24.785
<i>Bela Lugosi's dead</i>

01:35.508 --> 01:37.667
<i>Bela Lugosi's dead</i>

01:41.890 --> 01:43.966
<i>Undead, undead, undead</i>

01:49.147 --> 01:52.148
- You came.
- I told you I would.

01:54.819 --> 01:56.859
Shall we sit?

01:58.990 --> 02:01.398
I can't tell you that.

02:01.576 --> 02:03.901
- It's too embarrassing.
- Come on.

02:04.996 --> 02:07.831
Nothing you could ever say would-

02:08.458 --> 02:11.210
I mean, those poems you posted...

02:12.212 --> 02:14.537
they revealed who you really are.

02:16.382 --> 02:18.458
I know you, Kristen.

02:20.512 --> 02:22.089
Thanks.

02:22.263 --> 02:25.928
I actually... One today, you wanna-?

02:26.100 --> 02:27.180
Of course I do.

02:31.481 --> 02:32.643
Ow!

02:32.815 --> 02:34.475
Damn it.

02:41.157 --> 02:45.107
Paper cut. Clumsiest person ever.

02:47.747 --> 02:49.905
I have to go.

02:51.292 --> 02:53.201
Wait!

03:13.314 --> 03:14.346
Hi.

03:15.775 --> 03:17.317
Hi.

03:20.154 --> 03:21.483
I shouldn't be here.

03:22.198 --> 03:23.443
So why are you?

03:29.914 --> 03:32.915
I can't stop thinking about you.

03:34.294 --> 03:36.037
Then...

03:37.130 --> 03:38.873
don't.

03:39.299 --> 03:41.042
We can't do this.

03:41.759 --> 03:44.250
- We can't be together.
- There has to be a way.

03:44.429 --> 03:46.053
No.

03:47.182 --> 03:51.013
You think you know me,
but you don't.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.232
I've done bad things.

03:57.817 --> 04:00.984
You should run. Now.

04:01.154 --> 04:04.321
I can make my own decisions. I'm 17.

04:11.789 --> 04:14.494
I have to show you something.

04:16.252 --> 04:18.161
Okay.

04:30.892 --> 04:32.386
- I knew it.
- Are you scared?

04:33.186 --> 04:34.597
- No.
- You should be.

04:36.397 --> 04:38.022
I'm just scared...

04:38.191 --> 04:41.061
I'm dreaming
and I'll wake up in math class.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.357
Is it gonna hurt?

04:51.871 --> 04:53.994
I could never hurt you.

04:56.167 --> 04:57.994
Come with me.

04:59.128 --> 05:01.584
- Where?
- Let me show you my world.

05:05.677 --> 05:07.219
Edgy.

05:08.304 --> 05:13.595
So your place,
is there gonna be velvet?

05:13.768 --> 05:15.559
Yeah, sure.

05:16.479 --> 05:18.436
This is it?

05:19.107 --> 05:21.812
But it smells like pee.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.738
Nice work, Robbie.

05:26.906 --> 05:29.065
Robert. What's happening?

05:29.242 --> 05:31.863
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

05:48.595 --> 05:53.933
Hey. So I'm actually not far.
I'm about a night's drive.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.386
<i>Yeah? So you think...?</i>

05:57.562 --> 05:59.353
There's some stuff I gotta do first.

05:59.522 --> 06:02.856
<i>- Of course.
- But I was thinking that...</i>

06:03.026 --> 06:06.691
I'll wrap up here and, you know,
make sure I'm not followed.

06:06.863 --> 06:08.690
I'll take side streets, come at night.

06:08.865 --> 06:11.154
Will you just shut up
and get your ass home?

06:11.326 --> 06:13.402
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

06:13.578 --> 06:16.781
<i>- This phone thing's getting old.
- Yeah.</i>

06:17.707 --> 06:20.412
Well, call us when you're close.

06:21.252 --> 06:22.996
And be careful.

06:23.963 --> 06:25.671
Of course.

06:27.509 --> 06:28.919
Hey.

06:29.093 --> 06:32.462
- What are you so stoked about?
- What? Nothing. What do you got?

06:33.348 --> 06:34.676
Six girls in seven days.

06:34.891 --> 06:38.011
More disappearances than
this city has seen in over a year.

06:38.186 --> 06:40.309
- All about the same age and-
- And cute.

06:41.981 --> 06:43.773
Ice cream comes in lots of flavors.

06:43.942 --> 06:48.520
Sure. Well, half a dozen girls, late teens,
a shower away from greatness.

06:49.113 --> 06:50.691
It sounds like a profile.

06:50.865 --> 06:54.365
- I wonder what else they got in common.
- Well, six directions to go here.

06:54.536 --> 06:56.658
- Pick a number.
- Seven.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.118
Another call just came in today.

07:04.879 --> 07:06.124
<i>Kristen's a good kid.</i>

07:06.965 --> 07:09.800
A little naive, sure.

07:09.968 --> 07:12.209
You try and be a good parent.

07:12.971 --> 07:14.002
Girls are hard.

07:15.849 --> 07:18.090
Right.
We'd just like to find your daughter.

07:20.603 --> 07:23.723
- Last door on the left.
- Thanks.

07:28.111 --> 07:29.938
What do you think
he was talking about?

07:30.113 --> 07:31.690
Drugs?

07:43.668 --> 07:45.293
Oh, it is so much worse.

07:46.546 --> 07:48.254
Vampires?

07:48.423 --> 07:51.507
No, these aren't vampires, man.
These...

07:52.927 --> 07:55.549
- These are douchebags.
- Yeah.

07:55.805 --> 07:57.050
Wow.

07:57.974 --> 07:59.172
Hm.

08:06.232 --> 08:09.067
A- ha. All right.

08:09.235 --> 08:11.311
Let's see what we can see.

08:16.367 --> 08:17.530
All right.

08:19.495 --> 08:22.069
That's just uncomfortable.

08:22.248 --> 08:23.790
What is he so bummed out about?

08:31.341 --> 08:35.385
Look at this. He's watching her sleep.
How is that not rapey?

08:35.636 --> 08:36.965
I gotta concentrate, Dean.

08:42.936 --> 08:45.972
"He could hear the blood
rushing inside her, almost taste it.

08:46.147 --> 08:49.979
He tried desperately to control himself.
Romero knew their love was impossible."

08:50.151 --> 08:52.820
- Romero? Really?
- Dean, shut up.

08:52.987 --> 08:54.731
This is a national bestseller.

08:55.698 --> 08:56.861
How is that possible?

08:58.868 --> 09:01.110
Hey, try "Lautner."

09:03.665 --> 09:06.666
Wait, he's a werewolf.
How do you even know who that is?

09:06.835 --> 09:10.417
You kidding me? That kid's everywhere.
It's a freaking nightmare.

09:12.423 --> 09:14.167
Hey, how many T's
are there in Pattins-?

09:15.635 --> 09:18.126
That's it. We're in. Ha.

09:18.847 --> 09:20.554
All right.

09:20.932 --> 09:22.212
Well?

09:22.392 --> 09:25.393
Well, her inbox is full from
some guy claiming to be a vampire.

09:25.562 --> 09:27.186
A real vampire?

09:27.355 --> 09:31.519
Well... "I can only meet you at night.
I don't trust myself with you.

09:32.068 --> 09:36.148
The call of your blood is too strong."
Vampires phishing for victims?

09:36.322 --> 09:38.860
It's probably just
a human mouthbreather, right?

09:39.033 --> 09:41.275
On the other hand,
talk about easy prey.

09:41.786 --> 09:43.067
- For actual vamps?
- Yeah.

09:43.246 --> 09:45.037
These chicks throw themselves at you.

09:45.206 --> 09:49.121
All you gotta do is,
I don't know, write bad poetry.

09:49.335 --> 09:50.367
Huh.

09:51.212 --> 09:55.708
Well, this guy wanted to meet her
at a place called The Black Rose.

09:55.884 --> 09:58.588
- Give me a break.
- Just reporting the news.

09:58.761 --> 10:02.047
This is probably just your
standard-issue perv, right?

10:21.659 --> 10:24.494
DRIVER: Stop! Let me go!

10:52.337 --> 10:55.587
Okay, so now you're sure it's vampires?
A hundred percent?

10:55.757 --> 10:57.714
Definitely. We got a pattern now.

10:57.884 --> 11:00.126
Kids go missing,
blood bank van gets jumped.

11:00.303 --> 11:03.637
<i>This is the fourth town.
Clincher is, this last hit...</i>

11:03.849 --> 11:05.758
driver was found, throat ripped out.

11:05.934 --> 11:08.472
Okay. They grab kids.
That's food, right?

11:08.645 --> 11:11.812
But if they already got a bunch
of walking, talking juice bars...

11:11.982 --> 11:14.520
why bother with the blood mobile?
Doesn't add up.

11:14.693 --> 11:17.266
Find the nest. Figure it out.

11:21.449 --> 11:25.115
Well, you wanted emo chicks,
I think we hit ground zero.

11:26.288 --> 11:28.079
Thank you.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.573
You think she wears all that rubber
to the beach?

11:39.342 --> 11:42.676
When was the last time
we had a beer together anyway?

11:43.013 --> 11:44.092
There.

11:45.599 --> 11:47.057
What do you think?

11:47.559 --> 11:50.429
He's hitting on her hard enough.
Real?

11:50.937 --> 11:52.562
Well, it's hard to tell.

11:54.941 --> 11:56.601
And we got multiple choice.

11:56.818 --> 11:59.309
Yeah. Go call.

12:01.114 --> 12:03.107
Great. Three of them, two of us.

12:14.169 --> 12:15.912
Okay. Make that two of them.

12:19.799 --> 12:21.792
- Come with me.
- One's on the move.

12:26.431 --> 12:28.507
All right. You go with Efron,
I got Bieber.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.742
Are you sure, baby?
Are you ready to join me in eternity?

13:37.419 --> 13:39.542
Oh, my God, totally.

13:41.965 --> 13:44.503
- Hey!
- Go. Get out of here.

13:44.676 --> 13:47.167
What the-?
What the hell are you doing?

13:47.345 --> 13:48.543
Open your mouth!

13:49.055 --> 13:51.131
Take those out. Take them out.

13:53.518 --> 13:57.350
Ugh. For the love of-
What, are you 12?

13:58.482 --> 14:01.399
- Are you wearing glitter?
- I only do it to get laid, man.

14:02.569 --> 14:04.312
Does it work?

14:04.946 --> 14:07.069
I'll be damned.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.155
All right, "MMMBop" your way
out of here. Go, go.

14:11.828 --> 14:12.943
And use a condom.

14:20.378 --> 14:22.418
You're pretty.

14:23.173 --> 14:24.750
I'm sorry?

14:24.925 --> 14:27.676
I said you're pretty.

14:29.095 --> 14:32.180
Yeah, sorry again, pal.
I don't play for your team.

15:29.030 --> 15:30.441
No!

15:49.050 --> 15:51.043
Sammy.

16:02.106 --> 16:04.394
Oh, my God, what is that sound?

16:04.566 --> 16:06.109
What sound, Dean?

16:10.989 --> 16:13.231
Hey, come on. Keep it down, damn it.

16:15.494 --> 16:17.119
Please, please, shut that off.

16:18.539 --> 16:19.737
Jeez.

16:23.585 --> 16:26.076
- Dean, you should sit down.
- You sit down.

16:28.590 --> 16:31.627
Of all the ways to die,
never thought I'd be going out like this.

16:31.802 --> 16:34.507
Dean, nobody is going out.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.757
What?

16:46.734 --> 16:48.525
Samuel will kill me
when he gets here.

16:48.694 --> 16:50.852
- He's not.
- Because I'm gonna ask him to...

16:51.030 --> 16:53.355
- because you won't do it.
- Hold on a second.

16:53.532 --> 16:55.690
- For what? Look.
- We can figure this out.

16:55.868 --> 16:57.907
How?

17:00.831 --> 17:03.322
- Why aren't you freaked out?
- Of course I am.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.876
Really?

17:05.169 --> 17:08.502
Because I can hear your heartbeat,
and it's pretty damn steady.

17:10.382 --> 17:12.920
That's because
I'm trying to remain calm.

17:13.093 --> 17:15.002
Dean, look,
Samuel will know what to do.

17:15.179 --> 17:18.797
Come on, man, I'm a monster. Okay?
This is not a problem that you spitball.

17:18.973 --> 17:22.094
We gotta deal with this
before I hurt somebody.

17:28.358 --> 17:29.390
How's it feel?

17:30.277 --> 17:31.475
Now?

17:31.653 --> 17:35.105
- Now you wanna talk about my feelings?
- No, I mean physically.

17:35.574 --> 17:37.483
How do you think it feels? Not good.

17:38.452 --> 17:40.610
- Where you going?
- Bathroom, okay?

17:40.788 --> 17:43.539
News flash, Mr. Wizard. Vampires pee.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.581
Dean?

18:54.695 --> 18:55.975
Dean.

18:57.489 --> 18:58.984
Hey.

19:02.578 --> 19:06.575
Hey, I wasn't expecting you
for a couple of days.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.950
Yeah, yeah. I wanted to see you.

19:12.171 --> 19:13.546
What's up?

19:16.091 --> 19:17.918
- Are you okay?
- Listen.

19:18.093 --> 19:20.501
- What's going on?
- It doesn't matter...

19:21.180 --> 19:22.804
but I need you to know.

19:23.265 --> 19:24.759
You and Ben.

19:26.894 --> 19:28.092
Just...

19:29.980 --> 19:31.688
thanks.

19:31.982 --> 19:34.651
Okay? For everything.

19:36.612 --> 19:37.810
Dean, you're scaring me.

19:46.288 --> 19:48.245
Oh, God, I'm Pattinson.

19:48.415 --> 19:51.085
- What?
- Nothing. I've gotta go.

19:51.251 --> 19:53.577
No. You can't just show up
like this and then-

19:53.754 --> 19:54.833
Wish it was different.

19:55.005 --> 19:58.255
Stop and explain to me
what's going on out there.

20:00.969 --> 20:02.843
I can't bring this crap home to you.

20:04.098 --> 20:07.431
- You're talking about your work?
- I'm talking about my life.

20:08.936 --> 20:10.050
It's ugly...

20:11.355 --> 20:12.517
and it's violent...

20:13.649 --> 20:15.392
and I'm gonna die, soon.

20:18.946 --> 20:23.608
Just tell me what the hell is going on.

20:42.678 --> 20:45.798
- Dean?
- I gotta go.

20:55.399 --> 20:58.566
- Dean?
- Ben, just stay there.

20:59.028 --> 21:01.186
- I thought I heard you-
- I said stay back!

21:10.622 --> 21:13.707
You can't keep track
of your brother now?

21:13.876 --> 21:16.793
- Well, I didn't think he'd just-
- He's not himself, Sam.

21:17.629 --> 21:19.836
He's a monster and he's hungry.

21:21.925 --> 21:24.381
We gotta prepare to do the right thing.

21:25.763 --> 21:27.802
I told you he'd kill me
when he showed up.

21:32.019 --> 21:33.643
Did you feed?

21:35.981 --> 21:37.808
I went to say goodbye to Lisa...

21:39.568 --> 21:42.735
- which, for the record, was a lousy idea.
- Answer the question.

21:54.041 --> 21:56.448
You can relax. I didn't drink anyone.

21:58.462 --> 22:01.997
- Thank God.
- But I came close.

22:14.353 --> 22:16.061
All right.

22:19.274 --> 22:20.472
Do it.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.945
Okay, if you insist.

22:32.830 --> 22:34.454
Or I can just turn you back.

22:35.999 --> 22:37.873
- What?
- What?

22:40.629 --> 22:44.294
I didn't drive all this way to kill you,
Dean. I'm here to save you.

22:51.014 --> 22:53.850
That's my grandfather's journal.

22:54.017 --> 22:56.888
The cure's an old Campbell recipe,
kind of like the soup.

22:57.062 --> 22:59.980
No one's tried it since God knows.

23:00.232 --> 23:03.316
From what I hear,
the stuff is a bad trip.

23:03.736 --> 23:06.274
- Awesome.
- Hey, the cure is good.

23:06.447 --> 23:09.780
But a lot of this is on you.
You drink, you're done. It won't work.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.823
- I'm talking one drop of human blood.
- I got it.

23:12.995 --> 23:16.862
Do you? Because you will feed.
It's a matter of time.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.162
What else do we need?

23:19.793 --> 23:21.916
Some stuff we got, some we gotta get.

23:22.463 --> 23:25.250
The trickiest thing,
blood of the fang who turned you.

23:25.632 --> 23:26.877
That guy was huge.

23:27.051 --> 23:28.711
Nothing in the recipe about easy.

23:28.886 --> 23:29.917
I can get it.

23:30.095 --> 23:32.633
You gonna walk right into the nest?

23:33.515 --> 23:35.425
Well, I'm one of them, aren't I?

23:35.601 --> 23:38.804
So all I gotta do is get in there,
get the guy alone...

23:40.022 --> 23:42.809
and shoot him with
so much dead man's blood.

23:42.983 --> 23:45.474
- I should come with you.
- No. Dude, you reek.

23:45.778 --> 23:48.814
You're like a walking hamburger.
I gotta do this solo.

23:49.281 --> 23:52.152
Yeah, except we haven't been able
to find them yet.

23:52.326 --> 23:55.327
No problem. I can smell them.
They're two miles east of town.

23:55.496 --> 23:58.283
You guys get the other crap
and meet me there.

23:58.457 --> 24:00.035
Dean.

24:03.879 --> 24:05.338
It's dead man's blood.

24:05.506 --> 24:08.839
Now, there's enough there
to drop a linebacker and then some.

24:14.139 --> 24:15.420
Good luck, son.

24:30.739 --> 24:33.195
What the hell's wrong with you, Sam?

24:33.575 --> 24:35.948
- What do you mean?
- You knew about the cure.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.863
What? No, I didn't.

24:38.038 --> 24:39.830
We talked about it months ago.

24:40.749 --> 24:43.371
Not me. It must have been
Christian or something.

24:44.545 --> 24:46.039
Huh.

24:46.630 --> 24:49.999
Because if you had known, it'd be
almost like you let him get turned.

24:50.801 --> 24:55.130
Get a man on the inside, help us find
that alpha vamp we been looking for.

24:58.851 --> 25:00.843
You serious?

25:01.437 --> 25:03.725
Think I'd do that,
risk my own brother?

25:06.316 --> 25:07.894
What's wrong with you?

25:13.032 --> 25:16.068
Look, I'm just relieved we can fix him.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.967
- What's up?
- Hey. I'm-

26:21.141 --> 26:24.344
The guy Boris turned outside the bar,
right?

26:24.520 --> 26:28.469
- He said to look out for you.
- Yeah.

26:29.066 --> 26:32.684
Well, glad you made it, man.

26:34.655 --> 26:36.197
Oh.

26:37.074 --> 26:38.237
Follow me.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.787
So you must be starving.

26:53.966 --> 26:55.425
Uh...

27:05.436 --> 27:07.227
Here you go.

27:11.483 --> 27:13.476
I'm okay.

27:13.944 --> 27:16.898
I killed so many people
on the way over here, so...

27:17.531 --> 27:19.939
Yeah, about that...

27:20.117 --> 27:23.284
company line is,
we don't just kill people anymore.

27:25.164 --> 27:27.203
But you gotta tell me what that's like.

27:28.667 --> 27:33.376
Yeah. Yeah, first chance I get,
I'll show you myself.

27:33.589 --> 27:35.498
Sweet.

27:49.521 --> 27:53.305
Don't worry about them.
They're jealous.

27:53.484 --> 27:56.568
The recruiters get to bang
all the chicks.

27:56.737 --> 27:59.026
That's you now, bro.

28:01.158 --> 28:04.408
- The recruiters?
- Yeah.

28:04.995 --> 28:06.952
Big man will explain.

28:08.791 --> 28:11.032
Be with you in a minute.

28:13.128 --> 28:17.043
"Your skin is the black velvet
of the night."

28:18.467 --> 28:20.009
Nice.

28:20.177 --> 28:24.009
That stupid bitch will eat that up.
She'll be dying to meet.

28:29.687 --> 28:31.845
Go get yourself some blood,
sweetheart.

28:32.564 --> 28:35.518
Then march that little ass
right back here, okay?

28:47.663 --> 28:49.655
Thank goodness.

28:50.290 --> 28:53.244
I thought the hunter
chopped your pretty head.

28:54.211 --> 28:55.374
No, I got away.

28:57.089 --> 29:00.339
- Sorry, what's a hunter?
- You'll see if he finds us.

29:01.301 --> 29:03.045
You'll see him inside out.

29:06.598 --> 29:09.054
- You eaten?
- Yeah.

29:09.893 --> 29:12.563
Good. You'll need your strength.

29:13.355 --> 29:14.980
For...?

29:18.152 --> 29:20.275
Robert didn't tell you?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.992
How old do I look?

29:30.372 --> 29:31.997
Thirty-three?

29:33.459 --> 29:35.001
You're off...

29:35.169 --> 29:38.004
by about six centuries.

29:39.715 --> 29:44.044
And these are the best days
in the last 600 years to be a vampire.

29:46.847 --> 29:49.005
Dracula, Anne Rice? Please.

29:49.183 --> 29:50.593
These brats are so horny...

29:50.768 --> 29:54.350
they've reinvented us
as Prince Charming with a Volvo.

29:55.606 --> 29:59.105
They want a promise ring with fangs...

29:59.360 --> 30:01.352
so I give it to them.

30:01.945 --> 30:03.143
You.

30:03.322 --> 30:06.607
You go out and you get them,
and you bring them home to me.

30:10.579 --> 30:13.497
- So, what's with the cages?
- Oh, that's just, you know...

30:13.665 --> 30:14.910
till they're compliant.

30:16.668 --> 30:19.504
Eventually these girls
will fetch me boys like you...

30:19.671 --> 30:21.878
and around and around we go.

30:23.967 --> 30:26.043
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.592
This whole system, that's all you?

30:29.556 --> 30:33.850
No, no, no.
No. I just implement, you know?

30:34.019 --> 30:36.344
Make sure that you all fall in line.

30:38.023 --> 30:39.850
It's his.

30:42.111 --> 30:44.150
Our father's.

30:45.072 --> 30:46.235
Your father's?

30:50.202 --> 30:53.488
Aren't you the curious one?

30:54.498 --> 30:56.407
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

30:57.584 --> 30:59.873
In due time.

31:02.172 --> 31:03.916
You...

31:06.009 --> 31:08.761
You want the private tour, don't you?

31:11.432 --> 31:13.424
Thought you'd never ask.

31:36.874 --> 31:39.543
You playing games with me, boy?

31:55.809 --> 31:57.636
Father.

32:05.194 --> 32:06.474
Father.

32:07.654 --> 32:09.149
Father.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.943
Father.

32:18.957 --> 32:20.831
Father.

33:24.898 --> 33:26.690
Go get him!

34:05.808 --> 34:07.386
This must be the place.

34:08.478 --> 34:09.639
Shh.

34:44.013 --> 34:45.672
So much for undercover.

34:45.848 --> 34:47.592
Let's go.

35:24.136 --> 35:26.972
You've stopped nothing.
You know that?

35:36.107 --> 35:39.061
This is much bigger than you and me.

36:23.488 --> 36:26.857
Looks like your brother has
some Campbell in him after all.

36:42.673 --> 36:44.713
Dean, you okay?

36:47.762 --> 36:49.671
Yeah, I'm good.

37:11.369 --> 37:13.278
If this works, it's not gonna be
a kiddie ride.

37:13.454 --> 37:15.281
That's great. Light her up.

37:16.207 --> 37:19.540
- So, what'd you see in there?
- What?

37:19.710 --> 37:21.999
- In the nest. What'd you see?
- I can't hear you.

37:22.171 --> 37:25.457
Your blood is so freaking loud.
Just back off.

37:25.925 --> 37:28.250
All right, give me the damn cure.

37:35.476 --> 37:37.469
L'chaim.

37:53.494 --> 37:54.525
I don't think it-

38:00.668 --> 38:02.957
- Is it working?
- Either that or he's dying.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.834
Hi.

39:29.338 --> 39:30.452
So, what'd you see?

39:31.840 --> 39:34.794
- What?
- In the nest, what'd you see?

39:37.638 --> 39:39.132
I'm still working through it...

39:39.306 --> 39:41.927
but they're not figuring out
anything on their own.

39:42.100 --> 39:46.145
They're getting their orders from the top.
Where to go next, everything.

39:46.313 --> 39:48.638
- The top as in...
- Their alpha.

39:49.733 --> 39:53.945
That's what I think it is. They've got
some sort of psychic thing happening.

39:54.112 --> 39:56.900
He sends them,
I don't know, messages.

39:57.074 --> 39:58.948
Saying what?

39:59.326 --> 40:00.571
Honestly?

40:01.078 --> 40:02.157
Recruitment drive.

40:04.206 --> 40:05.700
Their alpha's building an army.

40:06.542 --> 40:09.875
- Well, that's comforting.
- This is not the worst.

40:10.045 --> 40:11.208
Then what is?

40:12.881 --> 40:14.423
We don't scare them anymore.

40:23.934 --> 40:25.594
<i>You've reached Lisa.</i>

40:25.769 --> 40:27.477
<i>Leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

40:29.148 --> 40:31.021
Hey, Lis.

40:32.651 --> 40:35.687
<i>To continue recording, press one.</i>

40:35.863 --> 40:37.321
<i>To erase-</i>

40:42.494 --> 40:43.953
How'd it go with Lisa?

40:44.872 --> 40:47.445
- It didn't.
- I'm sorry.

40:47.624 --> 40:49.249
Yeah.

40:50.085 --> 40:53.953
At least you got my back.

40:54.381 --> 40:57.501
No matter what happens, I can always
count on you. Right, Sammy?

40:59.511 --> 41:02.216
Yeah. Of course, Dean.
