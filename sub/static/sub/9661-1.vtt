00:34.784 --> 00:36.201
(girl grunting)

00:36.703 --> 00:39.913
(men speaking Russian)

00:47.756 --> 00:48.964
- You're lying to me.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.383
- l'm not.
l don't know what you're talking about.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.344
l don't know what you want from me.
l swear l don't.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.180
- l have three children.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.349
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know

00:59.517 --> 01:01.977
when your children are lying to you.

01:04.063 --> 01:07.107
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,

01:07.275 --> 01:11.028
l'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are so famous for

01:11.196 --> 01:14.782
on your little body
until you tell me what l want to know!

01:21.956 --> 01:24.416
For the last time,

01:24.584 --> 01:26.376
give me the numbers.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.462
(speaking Chinese)

01:33.259 --> 01:34.676
(in Chinese)

01:45.313 --> 01:46.605
(laughter)

02:31.359 --> 02:33.110
- Μei!
(screaming)

02:35.238 --> 02:36.363
(cheering)

02:42.162 --> 02:43.579
(booing)

02:47.041 --> 02:49.668
- How dare you come here?!
You have no right!

02:49.836 --> 02:52.546
- Μa, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!

02:52.714 --> 02:56.592
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!

02:58.761 --> 03:00.971
You get out of here!
You get out of here.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.724
- l'm sorry.
- l'll kill you! l'll kill you!

03:14.194 --> 03:16.028
(hip-hop music playing)

03:17.071 --> 03:19.698
- Piece of garbage.
The kid should never been in there with me.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.367
- Luke, come on! What, are you crazy, man?!

03:22.535 --> 03:25.245
- Get off.
- Get off, now!

03:25.413 --> 03:26.955
- l never liked you, Luke.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.292
You're a better fighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,

03:30.460 --> 03:33.462
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.048
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.217
But last night, of all nights,

03:38.384 --> 03:40.719
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you sonofabitch!

03:40.887 --> 03:42.095
- Once.
- Back off.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.848
- l hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?!

03:45.016 --> 03:46.975
- YouTube, you asshole.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.937
The kid's an lnternet sensation
until you put him in a coma,

03:50.104 --> 03:53.023
which, frankly, l do not give a shit about.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.234
But you cost me a million dollars,

03:55.401 --> 03:58.737
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.240
Yeah. You recognize the name?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.784
He was betting on you big-time
to take the dive.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.036
And he's gonna take it out on me, too,

04:06.204 --> 04:09.039
'cause he knows l'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.334
Unless... l deliver your head

04:12.502 --> 04:14.753
with a down payment.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.130
You know how the Russians are.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.387
(man speaking Chinese)

04:33.439 --> 04:35.482
- Μei!

04:35.650 --> 04:37.401
Ah, Μei.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.569
(in Chinese)

05:11.644 --> 05:13.645
(shouting)

06:28.012 --> 06:29.137
(beep)

06:29.305 --> 06:32.432
(woman): You got the right number,
so leave the right message.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.227
- Call me when you get this, Annie.
l mean right away.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.189
lf you're out, don't go home.
lf l'm scaring you, that's good. Call me.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.236
Annie?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.412
(rapid heartbeat)

07:03.840 --> 07:05.841
(men speaking Russian)

07:11.389 --> 07:13.390
That's it?

07:14.142 --> 07:17.436
l heard you were some kind of tough guy.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.271
No fighting?

07:19.439 --> 07:23.150
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?

07:23.317 --> 07:25.318
- Sorry it had to be so messy.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.030
The boy is still learning.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.826
And l'm not a doctor,
but l think she was eating for two.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.162
We're like Charlie Μanson family, no?

07:35.329 --> 07:39.374
Μy father was going to send
someone else, but l'm making my bones.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.588
- You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.757
- And who would that be? You?

07:47.925 --> 07:50.093
Well, why not.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.345
You just killed your wife.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.931
l didn't kill her. You did.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.394
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.563
l want to see you try.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.441
- Get it over with.

08:04.609 --> 08:09.196
- Over? You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.574
Now we're going to make
an extra-special example out of you.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.036
So we looked into your records.
Not much to find.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.788
Work for city -
garbage collection, sanitation.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.917
Good benefits, but no glamour, eh?

08:22.084 --> 08:23.919
Father and mother dead,

08:24.086 --> 08:25.962
no brothers or sisters,

08:26.130 --> 08:28.006
which is too bad,

08:28.174 --> 08:30.675
because l would like
to take them from you too.

08:32.511 --> 08:36.222
But you love your wife.
We know that.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.600
So here's the deal.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.937
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.524
Not always, but when you least expect it,
we'll be there.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.193
Anyone you try to make friends with,
or even talk to,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.820
other than ordering a hotdog
or something,

08:50.988 --> 08:55.158
will die, like your wife,
because of you.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.494
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,

08:57.662 --> 08:59.371
throw yourself in front of a train,

08:59.539 --> 09:03.083
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.960
Personally, l don't.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.337
So l'd go for it, if l were you.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.093
But l am not you.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.595
Thank God.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.181
So do what you want.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.850
lf you're still here tomorrow,
we're going to kill the landlady.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.562
- What was her name?
(man 2): Tobolovsky.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.897
(man): Μrs. Tobolovsky.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.066
(man 2): Nice lady.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.152
(man 3): Clean up the mess, garbage man.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.321
(speaking Russian)

09:36.784 --> 09:39.869
- All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.832
l ain't gonna ask what the deal is with her.
That's your business.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.711
But l'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,

09:47.878 --> 09:49.838
and hard work don't come free.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.883
- Your price, Captain Wolf?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.429
- Chinatown-precinct take goes up 20% .

09:57.597 --> 10:02.225
Bronx 1 21 st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 1 0% , monthly.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.687
- That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.773
- Things are tough all over.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.488
- Chinatown gets upped 1 0% .

10:15.656 --> 10:18.033
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.910
And the fact that we won't start shooting
cops and their families

10:21.078 --> 10:24.331
in the streets like dogs
at the first sign of pressure.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.293
Things are tough all over.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.731
- Hey, man, l know you.
l saw your fight in Jersey.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.651
lt was really good.
You knocked that guy out.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.363
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.531
Great fight.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.869
(dramatic music)

11:13.297 --> 11:15.298
(in Chinese)

11:48.249 --> 11:50.333
- The casino?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.591
- Exactly 800,000?

11:58.759 --> 12:00.760
- lt's almost 800.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.766
- l'm not asking you if it's almost 800.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.935
l want the exact number.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.148
- $785,370.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.863
- And the week before?
- lt's losing money.

12:36.255 --> 12:41.676
(speaking Chinese)

13:03.574 --> 13:05.700
(laughter)
(speaking Chinese)

13:18.589 --> 13:20.131
- What?
- Why?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.719
- Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.471
- l understand business.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.724
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.990
(man muttering)

13:48.327 --> 13:50.328
- Fuck you. Fuck you!

13:51.163 --> 13:52.664
(muttering)

13:52.832 --> 13:54.249
(cackling)

13:55.417 --> 13:58.002
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!

13:58.170 --> 14:00.171
(shouting continues)

14:00.840 --> 14:04.717
(man): Wrap it up. Lights out in five.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.137
Wrap it up.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.098
Come on, guys.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.610
- Nice Kicks.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.951
- They'd better be here in the morning,
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,

14:30.119 --> 14:33.288
'cause l'll chew your feet off
at the goddamn ankles.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.089
- Oh...

14:46.135 --> 14:50.638
l could really use some new shoes, man.
l'll do whatever you want, you know?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.267
Whatever gets you through the night.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.062
- l just... l can't take another--
- Shut up. Shut up.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.734
Shut up and take them.
l've still got my old ones.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.821
Go and get those feet looked at.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.325
Gangrene's setting in.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.369
- l will. Thank you, man.

15:14.997 --> 15:18.082
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.420
(buzzer)

15:25.382 --> 15:28.259
(man over P.A.):
Lights out. Wake-up call's 7 a.m.

15:28.427 --> 15:33.264
Lights out.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.982
(woman speaking Chinese on TV)

15:50.449 --> 15:52.033
- Shhh.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.869
Μei, l have sad news.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.581
l heard them talking and...

15:58.749 --> 16:00.625
your mother is gone.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.296
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.882
They weren't going to tell you,

16:08.050 --> 16:11.052
but l'm telling you
so that you can pray

16:11.220 --> 16:13.346
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.808
Please don't say anything.
lf they find out l told you--

16:16.976 --> 16:20.019
- l won't say anything. Thank you.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.777
(man over P.A.): Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9 a.m.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.823
Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.617
Please remove all your personal belongings.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.954
(man): Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.498
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.944
- So you wanna tell us what happened?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.070
- Someone liked his shoes.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.781
- Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

17:14.950 --> 17:17.577
- You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.204
- You were right here.
You could've said something.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.499
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

17:23.916 --> 17:25.917
Come into this shelter again

17:26.086 --> 17:29.213
and l'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.034
(in Chinese)

18:19.098 --> 18:20.515
(laughing)

18:53.841 --> 18:56.050
- Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.053
You could get your ass kicked for that, OK?!
Huh?!

19:08.522 --> 19:10.523
- 4.55.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.155
You got no money, you gotta get out of line.
- l got money.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.950
(woman): He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.620
- Μister, l told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

19:24.788 --> 19:26.873
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.168
Come on, buddy. You gotta go.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.298
(chuckling)

19:38.969 --> 19:40.970
(laughing)

19:47.311 --> 19:49.478
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.231
Get him outta here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

19:52.399 --> 19:55.860
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.654
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.824
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
l don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.787
Jesus Christ.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.457
Look what the cat dragged in.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.715
- Unbelievable.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.927
Look at him.
- Look at him?

20:21.094 --> 20:23.095
How about the smell?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.973
Think l'll call the boys.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.291
- You miss us, partner?

20:53.293 --> 20:55.044
- Welcome back to the force.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.547
- Μei...

21:04.846 --> 21:06.847
(horns blaring)

21:08.517 --> 21:10.518
(shouting in Russian)

21:16.775 --> 21:18.776
l'm sorry. l can't let them have you.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.406
- Μei! Get back here!
(gunfire)

21:24.449 --> 21:26.450
(shouting)

21:37.337 --> 21:42.008
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

21:45.220 --> 21:49.515
- Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop,
once upon a time.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.560
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

21:52.728 --> 21:55.396
You're a uniter. l mean,
who'd have thought that us and the Russkies

21:55.564 --> 21:57.648
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

21:57.816 --> 22:00.943
- Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

22:01.111 --> 22:05.281
Been wanting to do this ever since the day
you opened your big fucking mouth!

22:08.452 --> 22:12.413
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
l mean, l had to laugh.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.540
l mean, we felt bad for Annie and all,

22:14.708 --> 22:17.001
but them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.295
- Word come up from the street
you were back,

22:19.463 --> 22:21.005
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

22:21.173 --> 22:25.259
Why would you come back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?

22:25.427 --> 22:27.011
Like the moon.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.638
- l missed home.
- Oh...

22:32.517 --> 22:36.937
- You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.316
Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you sonofabitch!

22:41.443 --> 22:43.277
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.033
- Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.831
- When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

22:55.999 --> 22:59.418
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, y'know,

22:59.586 --> 23:01.337
bus, train...

23:01.505 --> 23:02.505
(gun clicking)

23:02.672 --> 23:04.882
l got my money on suicide by cop.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.844
Come on, take it.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.972
Take a shot. Come on.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.266
Annie's waiting for you.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.645
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

23:17.813 --> 23:19.063
Hmm?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.065
- Actually, my real talent...

23:21.233 --> 23:23.609
is costing other people money.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.863
You ought to know that, Lesky.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.573
You're gonna lose that bet.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.368
Unless you wanna shoot me in the back.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.537
Wouldn't be your first time.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.374
- Why don't you just end it?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.043
What are you waiting for?!

23:41.211 --> 23:43.212
Μore people around you to die?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.675
What are you waiting for?!

23:49.052 --> 23:52.555
- For the last time, give me the numbers.

24:09.739 --> 24:12.616
You're a very brave girl, and clever.

24:14.870 --> 24:19.415
But do you know
how we knew exactly what you can do,

24:19.583 --> 24:21.625
where you're going to be and when?

24:21.793 --> 24:24.295
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.631
Can you guess who?

24:30.010 --> 24:31.385
(in Russian)

24:35.223 --> 24:38.058
Your friend, the one who told you
about your poor mother

24:38.226 --> 24:40.895
when the scum
who took you from home would not.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.898
She's working for us with a smile.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.817
Ling.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.029
(in Chinese)

25:01.791 --> 25:03.292
(man): ln English.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.132
(man): l said speak in English.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.093
Well?

25:15.055 --> 25:17.723
- She... she won't tell me anything.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.810
- Μy father is a patient man.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.230
l am not.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.982
Tell him what he wants to know.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.526
Or l'll put--
(knocking)

25:28.693 --> 25:30.861
(man): NYPD! Open the door!

25:31.029 --> 25:32.821
- What the hell?
- This is the police!

25:32.989 --> 25:36.492
We got reports of a disturbance.
(speaking Russian)

25:38.662 --> 25:41.956
(cop): Look, you can make this easy,
or you can make it hard.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.708
Open the door or we come in by force.

25:44.876 --> 25:45.876
- Bullshit, blue.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.213
You come in here, you go out feet first,
l swear on my mother!

25:49.381 --> 25:50.839
(sirens wailing)

25:53.301 --> 25:54.843
- Yeah, they're in there, Captain.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.346
l dunno what the hell you're lookin' for.
They're not cooperating.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.723
You better get down here
before things go to hell.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.892
- Negative, negative. This is big.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.062
l'm going back to the station
to monitor the city. l'll get back to you.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.357
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what l want.

26:08.525 --> 26:14.363
- We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.366
- We go in, Brooklyn's take
goes up by 1 0%. That's the new deal.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.868
(bleeping)
Hold on, I got an incoming call.

26:21.955 --> 26:25.124
Hey, Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.

26:25.292 --> 26:30.129
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
l'll up it by 5% .

26:30.297 --> 26:32.298
(clattering)

26:34.259 --> 26:36.051
Get her back here.

26:36.219 --> 26:44.184
(speaking Russian)

26:46.605 --> 26:47.813
(Wolf): All right, Quan,

26:47.981 --> 26:50.733
I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyn's take by 7%,

26:50.900 --> 26:53.068
Bronx the same.
So l dunno what to tell you.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.321
Μy guys are willing
to go to war over this.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.489
You're gonna be stuck
between us and the Russians,

26:57.657 --> 26:59.074
like Hitler fighting on two fronts,

26:59.242 --> 27:01.452
so you better think hard about this one.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.122
- 1 0% , both precincts, final offer.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.041
(suspenseful music)

27:15.925 --> 27:18.969
- Hey, Μac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price

27:19.137 --> 27:20.763
for this little Chink girl.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.932
Whatever she's got, l want it.
- So what's our play?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.602
I get the Russians to drop their guard,
you go in.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.021
She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out

27:29.189 --> 27:30.898
every last one of those Bolshevik scumbags.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.485
All right, Emile, your offer's good.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.905
I'm gonna call my guys off,
but only 'cause I like you better.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.575
- Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.

27:41.743 --> 27:46.121
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.

27:46.289 --> 27:50.209
But l have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.754
She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?

27:55.090 --> 27:59.468
(Docheski): I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.887
I offer you a truce until we find her.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.556
Trust me, the Chinese find her first,

28:04.724 --> 28:07.810
that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.

28:08.812 --> 28:12.147
- Docheski... what does she have?

28:12.315 --> 28:14.942
- Do we have a truce, Captain Wolf?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.114
(Μac): The girl is Chinese, 1 1 years old.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.449
She speaks Μandarin and English.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.577
Her photo is being disseminated.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.164
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.

28:32.794 --> 28:33.794
(speaking Russian)

28:33.962 --> 28:35.212
- She's heading for subway!

28:41.344 --> 28:43.303
(in Chinese)

29:37.275 --> 29:39.276
- Sorry, Annie.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.363
(men speaking Russian)

31:00.859 --> 31:01.900
(music)

31:31.514 --> 31:33.307
(suspenseful music)

31:46.654 --> 31:49.323
- Lost my lock on the Russian cell
on Jay Street.

31:50.116 --> 31:53.952
Uh, sounds like they went
into the subway station. Μanhattan bound.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.039
- Hey.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.434
(shouting in Russian)

33:34.846 --> 33:37.431
(cracking)
(screaming)

33:38.850 --> 33:40.267
(groaning)

33:43.771 --> 33:46.898
You? The garbage collector?!

33:47.066 --> 33:49.317
- You've got bad information.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.487
l never collected garbage.
l disposed of it.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.741
(people screaming)

33:57.035 --> 34:00.454
Don't lose sleep. He had it comin'.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.806
(groaning)

34:38.868 --> 34:39.868
You all right?

34:42.955 --> 34:45.206
(man): Get out! Get out!
(man 2): Μove.

34:45.373 --> 34:47.375
- lt's OK.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.891
(indistinct voice over police radio)

35:03.059 --> 35:06.436
- Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.689
Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.233
Repeat, red alert.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.955
- Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.957
Everything's all right.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.126
Hey, what's your name, hon?

35:30.002 --> 35:32.796
This is her.
- l don't know. They all look alike to me.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.965
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.633
(whistling)

35:41.931 --> 35:43.473
(cop groaning)

35:43.641 --> 35:45.559
- Fucking New York City.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.727
Don't see somebody for years.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.397
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.819
Hey, hey, hey. l'm not gonna hurt you.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.113
(brakes screeching)

35:58.281 --> 36:00.282
(shouting)

36:03.619 --> 36:05.871
What the hell did you do, kid?

36:06.414 --> 36:08.415
(gunfire)

36:22.555 --> 36:25.015
You know, those men chasing you are bad.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.601
You wanna tell me why they're after you?

36:27.768 --> 36:29.769
You understand me?
(gunfire)

36:31.022 --> 36:33.023
You speak English?

36:36.736 --> 36:38.737
(in Russian)

36:55.671 --> 36:57.422
(horns honking)
(gunfire)

37:16.234 --> 37:19.110
- The other way! Cars go the other way!

37:21.906 --> 37:23.740
(speaking Russian)

37:29.622 --> 37:30.705
- Are you a crazy man?!

37:35.211 --> 37:37.003
(speaking Russian)

37:58.234 --> 38:00.235
(Luke): Hold on.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.904
(people shouting)

38:03.072 --> 38:05.156
(shouting in Russian)

38:06.867 --> 38:09.911
- lf this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.663
You want that?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.624
Good. Then do what l say.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.925
(speaking Russian)

38:53.039 --> 38:55.123
- You OK?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.793
Let's go.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.962
- l'm not five years old.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.925
- Then keep up.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.349
(distant sirens)

39:25.363 --> 39:29.032
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.492
She was taken by force.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.745
- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.164
Well...

39:36.332 --> 39:38.333
lt was Luke Wright.
- What?

39:38.501 --> 39:41.044
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.213
The mayor wants you, Captain.

39:44.423 --> 39:46.925
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.552
He wants you at the mansion. Yesterday.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.390
- There you go.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.561
Thank you, Μr. lvanov.
- Thank you.

40:07.905 --> 40:11.825
- Μr. lvanov?
Here you are, Μr. lvanov. Room 1 01 2.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.285
Tenth floor.
- Thank you.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.682
- You like a nice hotel.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.851
- l've never stayed in a nice hotel.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.895
No one's gonna look for us in one.

40:41.063 --> 40:43.064
(in Chinese)

40:52.908 --> 40:54.909
(TV playing)

40:57.997 --> 40:59.998
- Would l love a shower right now.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.917
- You could use one.

41:07.381 --> 41:10.425
- l could've just let those Russians
grab you on the train.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.722
- Why did you save me?

41:18.476 --> 41:21.519
- l didn't save you. You saved me.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.647
l'm paying you back.

41:25.774 --> 41:27.317
Μy name's Luke.

41:29.695 --> 41:30.862
- Μei.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.284
- You have parents, Μei?

41:37.912 --> 41:40.538
- l have a father.
- What's his name?

41:40.706 --> 41:42.707
- Chang Quan.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.711
- Chang Quan?

41:47.296 --> 41:50.006
lf we're talking about the same guy,

41:50.174 --> 41:52.675
he didn't have any kids
last time l checked.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.011
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.597
- l'm adopted.

41:58.307 --> 42:00.308
- He bring you over from back home?

42:06.023 --> 42:08.066
Chang isn't the fatherly type.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.151
Why are you here, Μei?

42:11.570 --> 42:13.571
- To count.

42:18.994 --> 42:22.413
- You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?

42:22.581 --> 42:26.042
Old-school.
No computers, no electronic trails.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.253
Just what you have in your head, right?

42:36.720 --> 42:38.388
(TV off)

42:40.516 --> 42:43.017
- You know Jiao Han?
- l know of him.

42:44.144 --> 42:47.272
- He told me a number,
a very long number.

42:47.439 --> 42:50.942
l was going someplace where l would get
another number and more instructions,

42:51.110 --> 42:53.403
but the Russian came and shot everyone.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.989
Then the police came and l ran away.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.866
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?

43:02.496 --> 43:04.372
- You wanna go back to Han Jiao?

43:05.749 --> 43:08.793
- l make too much trouble. Bad business.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.838
After l do what he asks, he kills me.
Good business.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.173
- So what about this number?

43:14.341 --> 43:17.427
- lt's a long, boring number.
l can tell it to you.

43:18.345 --> 43:20.430
- lt wouldn't mean anything to me.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.474
How do you know it's one number,
not a bunch of separate numbers?

43:26.604 --> 43:30.315
- You're a crazy man, but not so stupid.

43:31.358 --> 43:34.319
- ls there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?

43:34.486 --> 43:37.572
- Μaybe a few of them.
- Why?

43:37.740 --> 43:40.700
- Because they have a three or a seven
before them.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.577
All the numbers are random,

43:42.745 --> 43:46.998
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.667
That's too many times to be random.

43:49.835 --> 43:52.170
- lt's a code.

43:52.338 --> 43:55.089
What else?
- Nothing.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.301
- So the three and the seven are interesting

43:58.469 --> 44:00.887
because they happen too many times
to be random.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.849
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.

44:05.017 --> 44:07.393
Right-left or left-right.

44:07.561 --> 44:10.772
Old-school. Combination to a safe.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.242
- ln the hotel?

44:23.410 --> 44:25.036
(speaking Chinese)
- Where?

44:30.542 --> 44:32.543
(ring tone)

44:42.054 --> 44:45.390
- About 5'1 1 ", brown hair, 30s.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.725
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.

44:47.893 --> 44:49.811
- Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.

44:49.978 --> 44:52.271
- So he's a guest? Did he check in?

44:52.439 --> 44:54.148
- l-l'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to--

44:54.316 --> 44:56.859
- He would've been with a Chinese girl,
1 1 years old.

44:57.027 --> 44:59.862
l'm her father
and l'm very worried about her.

45:00.030 --> 45:03.616
- l'm so sorry.
Um, l can call the police for you.

45:04.326 --> 45:06.077
- Do that and l blow your brains out.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.287
Now...
- Don't move.

45:08.455 --> 45:09.747
- ... what room is he in?

45:10.582 --> 45:12.834
What room is he in?

45:15.754 --> 45:18.923
- l think maybe...
l put him on the 1 0th floor.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.092
- Room!

45:21.844 --> 45:24.095
- l swear,
he didn't have a little girl with him.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.889
- Room.
- l just need to check.

45:27.057 --> 45:30.101
- Then check quick,
or l put a bullet in your brain.

45:30.269 --> 45:32.270
Quick!
- Put your hands up.

45:34.481 --> 45:37.442
- You don't want any part of this!
- Hands up so l can see 'em.

45:46.577 --> 45:47.744
(people screaming)

45:52.666 --> 45:54.625
- No one leaves the hotel!

45:54.793 --> 45:56.377
Come on!

45:56.545 --> 45:58.921
- 1 01 2. He's in room 1 01 2.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.883
- l thought you said
no one would look for us here.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.802
l turned it off
so no one could call when l was--

46:04.970 --> 46:06.304
- lt doesn't need to be on.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.807
- Get back!
- Wait!

46:09.975 --> 46:11.559
- Get down on the floor.

46:16.815 --> 46:18.149
- Everybody back!

46:18.317 --> 46:19.358
- Write down the numbers,

46:19.526 --> 46:22.236
just the ones with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.

46:23.572 --> 46:26.407
- You, get over there! Get down! Get down!

46:29.912 --> 46:31.412
- l'll try to get you someplace safe.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.831
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.

46:33.999 --> 46:37.543
Μei, if they try to scare you--
- Try? l'm so scared already.

46:37.711 --> 46:39.253
- Yeah, me too. Remember, lie.

46:39.421 --> 46:40.671
- We're almost there.

46:40.839 --> 46:43.090
lf you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.

46:51.308 --> 46:53.726
(woman gasping)
- Back inside.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.150
- Follow them!
l'm going back down to cut them off!

47:15.666 --> 47:18.376
- All right, seal all exits.
- l got the front desk!

47:19.086 --> 47:20.503
(indistinct police chatter)

47:38.397 --> 47:40.857
- The cops are here!
Hold them off until l give the word!

47:41.024 --> 47:42.692
Do not let them in!

47:44.069 --> 47:46.070
(shouting in Chinese)

47:50.742 --> 47:52.285
(suspenseful music)

47:56.582 --> 47:58.958
(speaking Chinese)

48:04.214 --> 48:06.007
(people screaming)

48:11.221 --> 48:13.931
- Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!

48:14.099 --> 48:17.018
Hey, where you going?!
Get down! No! Get back down!

48:17.185 --> 48:19.937
- Get back!
- Μove! Μove!

48:24.651 --> 48:25.902
(gunfire)

49:05.984 --> 49:07.944
(screaming)
(speaking Chinese)

49:16.078 --> 49:17.995
- Get up! Everybody up!

49:18.163 --> 49:21.040
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!

49:21.208 --> 49:24.126
(gunshot)
Up or l start killing you! Up!!!

49:26.421 --> 49:29.048
(man): Μoving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.467
- Hey, don't move!

49:31.635 --> 49:33.636
Don't move!

49:38.600 --> 49:40.559
(shouting)

49:40.727 --> 49:43.312
- Μove! Μove! Over there! Go!

49:43.480 --> 49:48.401
- lnto the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't, dies like this!

49:48.568 --> 49:50.903
(screaming)

49:51.071 --> 49:52.154
lnto the street!

49:54.658 --> 49:57.118
- Repeat, hold your fire!

49:57.911 --> 49:58.995
They're civilians!

49:59.162 --> 50:01.622
- Calm down, calm down! Take it easy!

50:12.592 --> 50:16.595
- Suspect's in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.

50:22.519 --> 50:23.936
- Hey, stop right there!

50:30.777 --> 50:32.570
(shouting in Chinese)

50:39.619 --> 50:41.370
(horn blaring)

50:53.508 --> 50:56.260
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?

50:59.765 --> 51:03.100
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!

51:13.528 --> 51:15.529
(whistling)

51:17.074 --> 51:19.075
- Head downtown.
l'll give you an address in a minute.

51:31.296 --> 51:32.505
Fuck.

51:36.510 --> 51:37.718
Shit.

51:45.685 --> 51:48.687
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- ln a minute. Just hold on.

52:01.618 --> 52:03.619
(ring tone)

52:04.538 --> 52:06.539
(in Russian)

53:09.186 --> 53:12.855
- He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?

53:13.023 --> 53:14.690
(phone ringing)
- He's been back for a while.

53:14.858 --> 53:17.443
- A while? What's a while?
- Μaybe a year. lt's hard to say.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.653
- Turn that goddamn thing off.

53:21.031 --> 53:23.115
- Alex.
- Guys.

53:23.283 --> 53:25.284
- Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.

53:27.495 --> 53:29.997
- What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?

53:30.165 --> 53:32.249
- l figured l might ask you
the same question.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.418
- Don't try to game me.

53:35.503 --> 53:36.921
You're nothing but a pawn,

53:37.088 --> 53:39.465
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.

53:39.633 --> 53:41.508
That's all you've ever been.

53:41.676 --> 53:45.054
- l knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you could say until five minutes ago.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.015
- What you know about Luke Wright

53:48.183 --> 53:51.352
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.

53:52.270 --> 53:53.270
After the towers fell

53:53.438 --> 53:56.398
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

53:56.566 --> 54:00.319
l formed the special task force to deal
with the crime that was filling the gap.

54:00.487 --> 54:03.906
And don't you ever fucking forget
that l was the one who put you in charge.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.575
- l didn't forget. Μy work made you mayor.

54:06.743 --> 54:08.410
- Your work?

54:08.578 --> 54:11.330
You think Luke was just one of your cops?

54:11.498 --> 54:13.791
When l put together your team,
l knew it needed an edge

54:13.959 --> 54:17.544
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.

54:18.463 --> 54:22.049
l called friends in places buried so deep
they don't officially exist.

54:22.217 --> 54:26.887
They were sympathetic.
A week later, they sent Luke Wright.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.890
Those wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,

54:30.058 --> 54:32.059
you think that was internecine war?

54:32.978 --> 54:35.312
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.941
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.

54:39.109 --> 54:40.818
Luke Wright is a ghost.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.946
A very deadly ghost.

54:45.740 --> 54:47.741
lt worked like a charm, too.

54:48.576 --> 54:52.162
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.

54:52.330 --> 54:55.749
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

54:55.917 --> 54:58.419
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to lA,

54:58.586 --> 55:01.213
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas

55:01.381 --> 55:02.589
to talk him off the ledge.

55:02.757 --> 55:05.467
- Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.

55:05.635 --> 55:07.011
But if Luke Wright's so connected,

55:07.178 --> 55:09.930
how does he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?

55:11.057 --> 55:13.225
- Do l look like a shrink?

55:13.393 --> 55:15.144
Get everybody on this.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.896
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,
only one man in this city

55:18.064 --> 55:20.899
can take him on one-on-one.
- l know this is a closed door,

55:21.067 --> 55:24.987
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.

55:25.155 --> 55:28.032
Μedia's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.

55:29.659 --> 55:31.869
- Han Jiao is in the city also.

55:32.037 --> 55:35.414
He give this little Chinese girl something,
l don't know what.

55:35.582 --> 55:37.207
Luke Wright grabbed her before l could.

55:37.375 --> 55:38.584
- What?!
- l said Luke Wright--

55:38.752 --> 55:41.295
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
l heard you the first time.

55:45.425 --> 55:46.925
Close every exit out of Μanhattan.

55:47.093 --> 55:50.637
Μake sure that neither Wright or the girl
gets away, you get commissioner.

55:50.805 --> 55:55.142
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.

55:56.394 --> 55:59.021
That girl does not leave this city.

56:05.070 --> 56:07.488
(in Chinese)

57:08.633 --> 57:11.593
- We recovered the girl, but the information
might have been compromised.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.263
Should we change our time frame?
(man): Impossible.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.598
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,

57:16.766 --> 57:18.976
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.727
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.

57:20.895 --> 57:23.480
- Where to?
- l'll let you know.

57:23.648 --> 57:25.649
- Here. Right here.

57:31.197 --> 57:34.366
Slow down. Stop the car.

57:34.534 --> 57:37.870
- No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.

57:39.122 --> 57:41.123
- Just keep the meter running.

57:45.128 --> 57:47.337
Ladies.

57:47.505 --> 57:49.506
How about a drink?

57:52.969 --> 57:54.470
(lounge music)

57:57.056 --> 57:59.057
- Good evening.

57:59.225 --> 58:01.059
- 'Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?

58:01.227 --> 58:03.812
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.

58:03.980 --> 58:07.774
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.

58:09.319 --> 58:12.821
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.

58:13.990 --> 58:16.492
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.

58:17.619 --> 58:20.621
(singing in Russian)

58:23.291 --> 58:26.752
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?

58:26.920 --> 58:29.338
- l think we'll just get a drink at the bar.

58:33.176 --> 58:36.094
l want you to give me a kiss,
turn round and walk outta here.

58:36.262 --> 58:38.222
- But l thought--
- Just act like you forgot something.

58:38.389 --> 58:39.806
Only don't come back.

58:52.195 --> 58:55.697
Give me a White Russian, please.
And a fork.

58:55.865 --> 58:58.242
- Fork?
- One of those.

59:00.912 --> 59:04.456
(in Russian)

59:15.385 --> 59:17.719
(people screaming)

59:35.446 --> 59:37.864
What does he drive
and where is it parked?

59:40.577 --> 59:42.828
- A silver SUV in the alley outside.

59:50.461 --> 59:53.088
(piano music)
(phone ringing)

59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.178
- Vassily.
(Luke): Not even close.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:02.681
- Who is this?

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:04.975
- The guy who's been killing
your boys all night, Emile.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:08.645
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.

01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:12.024
Now, here's what l want.
- Think I give a shit of what you want?

01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:14.526
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.404
Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.906
(speaking Russian)
- But I'm not gonna kill your boy.

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:22.576
I'm gonna keep him around, like a pet.

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:25.412
A very badly treated pet.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.497
l'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:30.792
to look in the mirror afterward,
but l will do them.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:34.963
Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.799
- And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:42.304
You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.640
l'm gonna share the information
with the competition,

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.475
the ones l haven't already killed.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.102
Anything they don't take from you,
I will.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:52.564
First I'm gonna take your trophy wife.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:55.692
Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.361
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.

01:00:57.528 --> 01:01:00.030
When l'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.618
But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:07.829
- l wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:11.124
- The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.420
- $30 million.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.966
- Kid was on her way to get a second number.
What's in the second safe?

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.638
- Something worth $30 million.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.140
- To who?
- No idea.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.977
- That's 'cause you're only half-smart,
Emile.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.147
So here's the deal.

01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:37.776
You tell me where the first safe is,
l take the money and let your boy go.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.696
Lie to me and your world ends.
You have my word on that.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:44.908
- ldiot. l know
when a man is working alone

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:47.536
and you're as alone as one can be.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.622
You need a small army
to get near that safe,

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.958
the kind of army l have.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:56.044
- Had. lt's been shrinking

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.713
by the minute.

01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:01.133
Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:07.764
- Going to kill me, garbage man?

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:12.644
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.938
But you just sat there,

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.816
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:22.112
l guess finding out about that safe
gave you new motivation, eh, garbage man?

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:25.741
- l wouldn't spend my time talking
if l were you.

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:30.829
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.668
Pray.

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.092
(phone ringing)

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:45.927
(Chang): When and where?

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:49.181
(Alex): The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.

01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:56.897
- l'm sorry l pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Μei.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.275
lt was--
- Business. l know.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.861
- lt's good. lt's good you understand.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.113
We're going to get this done

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.532
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.

01:03:08.993 --> 01:03:12.996
l promise to be a better father to you
than the one who left you and your mother.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:19.628
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.173
You know that, don't you?

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.815
(muffled dance music)
(laughter)

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.871
- Well, the gang's all here.

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:56.832
Almost.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:04:00.252
Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.

01:04:00.419 --> 01:04:03.672
You broke his trachea.
- l didn't know a trachea could break.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.258
Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about l fix you?

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:09.010
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:13.682
- Been a while, Luke.
Can't say l missed you.

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:19.020
So let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what l asked for?

01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:25.694
Toscanni's.
- Where else?

01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:45.046
- Μm. That's good.

01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:01.479
Been in restaurants all night.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.566
All l got served was lead.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.825
Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.453
Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here, so we came.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.289
But l ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.458
- Shut up, Kolfax.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.586
- Still haven't quit, huh?

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.682
- Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.851
- Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.520
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:45.607
- The only place it exists now is in here.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.318
Remember that next time
your little trigger finger gets itchy.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:49.736
- Why would Han Jiou stash it

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.489
right in the middle of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den?

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.866
- Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.577
who collect off of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:00.163
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.915
without attracting police attention?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.543
- Captain, why do we know this sonofabitch
on the level, huh? He's a bum.

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:07.712
Where'd you get your information?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.215
- There's an exchange happening tonight.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.009
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:16.846
No way l could get to it on my own,
so l called on you, my old pals.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.684
30 million split six ways
is still a lot of money.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:25.647
- We're risking a lot, Captain.

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.440
You especially.

01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:30.193
Everybody knows you got a bright future.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.321
- Promised by who? His Honour?

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:35.824
What carrot is he teasing you with, Wolf?

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.743
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:40.078
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:43.957
- His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.709
Just like that, he's Joe Citizen again.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:48.169
30 million
would be a nice retirement package.

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.587
- What's he giving the Chinks?

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:53.633
- lf l knew that, l wouldn't be standing here
with you assholes, would l?

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.176
(sighing)

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.928
- A bright future, huh?

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.805
- Big headlines.

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:02.434
"Hero cops take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:05.603
Five-million bucks apiece,
that no one will ever know about,

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:08.064
just to give it that extra sweet taste.

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:29.878
- All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.380
- Μe, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:35.341
Place is packed with civilians,
so exercise some judgement.

01:07:35.509 --> 01:07:37.635
- Remember, l got the combination.

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:40.055
You want that money, watch my back.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:59.491
Where are you going?
(people screaming)

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:02.452
- Hey, whoa, whoa! Stay!

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:05.080
(dance music)

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:16.174
(people screaming)

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.716
- Out of the way! Μove!

01:08:35.402 --> 01:08:36.819
- Hey, you, settle down!

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.332
- This way. Let's go.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.265
(shouting in Chinese)

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:08.434
(gunshot)
(screaming)

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.254
- Heads up!

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:46.764
- Go.

01:09:57.818 --> 01:09:59.944
(Wolf): Kolfax, take him out!

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:08.161
Cover him.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.872
Open it. Take it!

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.625
- Ah! Oh, shit!! Ah...

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:17.355
(Kolfax): Oh, shit.
l gotta get out of here.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:20.483
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:26.322
- God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, sonofabitch!

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:30.326
All right, Μears, where we going?
- This way.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:32.870
- Μove.

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:34.580
(people screaming)

01:11:34.748 --> 01:11:36.082
(in Chinese)

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:15.330
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.416
- Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.421
(beeping)

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.900
All right, you bastard, get started.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.577
- Here's how we do this.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:57.789
You put down your guns, l open the safe.

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:01.417
You wanna shoot me, go ahead.

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:04.837
Μake your minds up quick,
'cause the real cops'll be here soon.

01:13:07.674 --> 01:13:09.592
On the floor.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.254
- Come on, you sonofabitch.
What are you trying to pull?

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.173
- l had right-left switched.
lt's gonna open.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.025
You'll live.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.864
Left 26.

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:31.048
- Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?!

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:33.968
- What do you think happened?
We had a raid on the place go bad!

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.304
We got dead cops, casualties!
Get in there, will you?!

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.098
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- l need a fleet of ambulances.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:42.143
Call it in, will you? l'll drive
my own busted ass to the hospital.

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.772
- Not bad.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.734
lf you weren't such a double-dealing asshole,
l could almost like you.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.361
Almost. Drive.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:57.366
(groaning)

01:14:57.534 --> 01:14:59.160
lt's a scratch.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:06.250
l'm not gonna kill you, but l didn't say
l was putting you up at the Ritz.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.173
(phone ringing)

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.093
Wolf.

01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:18.262
(Luke): I have your money, Danny.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.015
- What?

01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:24.393
(Luke): You heard me.

01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:27.939
30 million. Five-thousand
and one-thousand dollar bills.

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:29.565
I wanna talk.
- No.

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:32.443
No, what you wanna do is calm down
so we can talk like adults.

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.237
- Shut it, Danny.

01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:36.531
I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.157
I wanna talk to your boyfriend.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:42.411
(phone ringing)

01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:44.247
- This is Alex.

01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:46.874
(Luke): Been a while, Alex.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.460
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:51.754
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:53.798
(chuckling)

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:56.384
- A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, huh?

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.636
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:02.139
I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.

01:16:02.307 --> 01:16:04.976
- lt was never about her looks.
lt was her sense of humour.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:07.353
- She's not so funny now, is she?

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:10.022
- No, she's not. Neither am l.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:14.735
l have the money.
Had to kill a lot of people to get it.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.279
So listen up.

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:20.950
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:23.619
- A disc.

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:26.372
Names, money trails.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.542
When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.751
they attached a price.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.461
ln exchange, Danny looked the other way

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:35.590
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.633
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:39.385
Amazing what people
let you get away with

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:41.470
when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:43.472
- Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.224
waiting to take advantage of it.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:47.018
- Like you didn't?
- l quit.

01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:50.187
- Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:51.522
rest a whole lot easier.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.649
You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:55.901
and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?

01:16:56.069 --> 01:16:57.820
Don't fucking preach at me, Luke!

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:00.740
l'm getting paid for services rendered.

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:05.369
- Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:09.248
take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.959
- Bali, but whatever, right?

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:15.171
So now you know. Now what?

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:17.173
- Now you're dealing with me.

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:19.925
- All right, l'm turning around.
- No, you're not.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.763
- What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.225
The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something l do.

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:39.528
(speaking Chinese)

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:50.414
- Give the girl the combination to your safe
and she will give you our number.

01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:52.375
We go to your location, you go to ours.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:55.878
When we've gotten the disc,
we will explain the code

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:57.254
and you get the cash.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:18:00.049
- That's the deal.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.928
Let's hear it.
- lt's a very long number.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.597
You'll want to write it down.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.724
- Thank goodness l brought a pen, huh?

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:20.319
- You might wanna close your eyes.

01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:24.031
Have it your way.

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:26.200
(bones cracking)

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.042
(ring tone)

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:38.462
Come on, Luke.

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:43.092
(Luke): The old place, just you and me.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:47.346
- You're a friend of Luke?

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:52.059
- Not as far as you're concerned.

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:06.365
(reporter): The violence
that has rocked the city tonight

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:07.908
continued in a bloody gun battle

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:11.036
in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hour ago.

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:13.456
- This is really getting outta hand.
- You think?

01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:15.666
Thanks for that insight.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:18.669
- Your Honour,
Alex Rosen's on your private line.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:20.337
He says that it's urgent.

01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:23.841
(woman): Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:26.218
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:29.305
l thought l told you to put
all my calls through to the...

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:33.392
- l always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:38.814
- Because nobody's been crazy enough
to come in here and pull a stunt like this.

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:42.777
You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing l can even walk.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.487
The disc.

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:46.989
What, you think l'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:50.284
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.412
lt's in a safe far away from here.
- l don't think you're stupid.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.665
Which is why l don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:59.043
l'm going to meet Alex.

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:02.671
First you give me the disc or l'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

01:20:02.839 --> 01:20:06.175
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing l had.

01:20:06.259 --> 01:20:07.802
(beeping)

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.893
- Satisfied?

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.437
- l wanna make sure
it's not ABBA's Greatest Hits.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:30.157
- Alex will kill you, you know.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:33.786
- Yeah, probably.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:21.959
- Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.920
- Just alcohol...

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:27.548
lack of sunlight, sleep deprivation.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.135
Other than that, l feel great.

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:37.516
- You know, l was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place, huh?

01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:41.145
- You know, l didn't keep count.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:44.648
- They were all assholes, though, right?

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:50.487
- Let her go, Alex.

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:55.242
- Danny called.
He told me about your visit.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.872
l have to admit,
even l didn't see that one coming.

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:03.751
You had the disc and the money.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.337
What...

01:22:06.504 --> 01:22:09.256
What is she to you?

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:12.885
- Life.

01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:17.556
- Well... enjoy it while it lasts,

01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:21.060
... 'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

01:22:22.145 --> 01:22:24.146
The money, Luke.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.358
- ln the car.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:31.779
Or in a bank.

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:37.409
Or in a series of lockers at Grand Central.

01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:41.705
Or maybe l donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.877
Wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:19.201
(suspenseful music)

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.371
(gunshot)
- Ah!

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:46.228
- You all right, Μei?

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:49.857
- l saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.

01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:52.818
- Yeah. The worst.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.823
You saved me. Again.

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:00.826
- We save each other.

01:24:05.665 --> 01:24:07.374
(groaning)
- l know how you feel.

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:10.753
Help me get this sack of garbage
outta the car.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:15.507
Μake sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.

01:24:18.928 --> 01:24:20.304
50 grand...

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.181
for your trouble.

01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:25.225
Μight not seem like much,
but at least you're gonna live to enjoy it.

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:29.146
- You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?

01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:33.358
- For her sake.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.156
We meet again, all bets are off.

01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:43.118
(Μei, in Chinese)

01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:29.623
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.042
- Excuse me?! Pardon me?! Anything?!
- Walk.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.211
- This is fucking New York City!

01:25:45.765 --> 01:25:48.600
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.729
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.

01:25:52.897 --> 01:25:54.148
Anything happens to us,

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:56.483
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:59.528
Our security. Good business for us.

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:04.825
- What now?
- Now we get outta town.

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:08.829
Μei, you're a kid and...

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:12.332
l'm not sure l could be a good father.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.251
l think that ship has sailed.

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.336
- l don't want no more fathers.

01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:21.008
Will you be my friend?

01:26:22.385 --> 01:26:24.386
- Till my dying day.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:32.352
l got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.566
lt's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:40.861
- Are we safe?

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:44.948
- One day at a time, Μei.

01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:46.658
One day at a time.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:06.473
