00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[English subtitles are available]

00:31.780 --> 00:32.840
It's so hot.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.520
Hey, Seung Tak, put the life vest on.

00:38.920 --> 00:39.820
Hurry. Put it on.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.760
Ah, Dad, this one is huge…

00:46.690 --> 00:48.060
Seung Tak!

01:52.190 --> 01:54.830
Doctor, the oxyhemoglobin saturation is dropping!

01:54.830 --> 01:55.830
What?

01:57.860 --> 01:59.259
What should we do?

01:59.259 --> 02:01.170
We need to connect him to the ECMO machine.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.330
We need to connect him to the ECMO machine.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.540
But Professor O is not available.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.800
What do we do?

02:50.650 --> 02:53.390
Hey, Go Seung Tak, where are you going? Hey!

02:59.860 --> 03:01.260
[Episode 13]

03:02.730 --> 03:04.830
What caused the death of the patient exactly?

03:04.830 --> 03:07.200
The fractured ribs caused rupture of the descending aorta,

03:07.200 --> 03:08.700
resulting in hypovolemic shock.

03:08.700 --> 03:09.700
Any mistake made by the surgical team?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
I don't think it's Dr. Go's mistake.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.440
The patient's blood pressure suddenly dropped

03:13.440 --> 03:15.770
while they were still waiting for Professor Jeon.

03:15.770 --> 03:16.980
It was an emergency.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.740
They had to do something.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.150
But it already ruptured when they opened the patient's chest.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.350
So it's not a medical malpractice, right?

03:22.350 --> 03:24.850
Under such circumstances, a resident physician

03:24.850 --> 03:27.190
would press on it with hands while waiting.

03:27.190 --> 03:28.690
You don't even have to do it yourself.

03:28.690 --> 03:31.890
But I think Dr. Go wanted to try his best to save the patient's life.

03:31.890 --> 03:35.190
Plus, it's said that the patient had such underlining disease as high blood pressure,

03:35.190 --> 03:38.430
which means his descending aorta is larger than normal,

03:38.430 --> 03:41.130
so it's more fragile.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.940
No matter what, Dr. Go did everything

03:43.940 --> 03:46.500
he could in such extreme situation.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.710
You all can't wait to express your opinions, can you?

03:48.710 --> 03:51.079
If others hear you, they may think you are in this together.

03:51.079 --> 03:53.650
Is that what you are going to say to the patient's family?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.720
Yes. Since the patient passed away, we should take responsibilities.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.250
But it's more of a moral obligation.

03:59.250 --> 04:02.320
I mean it shouldn't be considered a medical malpractice.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.890
We can look into that in the future then.

04:05.860 --> 04:08.230
Although, why are you here, Chief Ban?

04:08.760 --> 04:09.590
What?

04:09.590 --> 04:11.700
Aren't you supposed to be in the Operating Room right now?

04:12.430 --> 04:15.870
What do you mean the operation is canceled?

04:16.329 --> 04:17.740
Is it really canceled,

04:17.740 --> 04:19.670
not postponed for a few hours?

04:19.670 --> 04:23.170
Well… Something happened in our department.

04:23.170 --> 04:25.610
The Chief is distracted.

04:25.610 --> 04:27.150
I don't know what happened exactly,

04:27.150 --> 04:29.010
but what are we going to do with his operation?

04:29.010 --> 04:30.920
When will they be ready to do it?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.380
I'm not sure.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.190
Where's Dr. Go Seung Tak?

04:34.190 --> 04:35.750
Wait. Professor Jang.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.130
Actually Go Seung Tak is involved in the thing.

04:42.330 --> 04:46.770
What am I supposed to do?

04:49.430 --> 04:51.440
Why would this happen?

04:55.470 --> 04:57.440
Go Seung Tak, stop!

04:57.440 --> 04:59.040
You can't leave like this!

04:59.710 --> 05:00.910
Seung Tak!

05:08.220 --> 05:10.060
Go Seung Tak! Darn it.

05:14.860 --> 05:17.930
Go Seung Tak! Seung Tak!

05:19.400 --> 05:20.600
Seung Tak!

05:23.130 --> 05:24.740
I can't believe him.

05:27.110 --> 05:32.010
I told you to be more careful.

05:34.110 --> 05:35.380
Oh, well.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.420
I was pushed out during the operation.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.490
I tried to get back, but it didn't work.

05:41.990 --> 05:43.659
Why did it have to happen at that time?

05:43.659 --> 05:46.360
Even if it hadn't happened, it would've still been hard to save his life.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.400
That's why you should stop when you don't feel well.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.070
Why do you have to borrow his hands to save the patient?

05:55.070 --> 05:56.940
It wasn't me this time.

05:57.570 --> 05:59.300
I saw the look in his eyes.

06:02.470 --> 06:03.710
[EunSang University Medical Center]

06:04.180 --> 06:07.310
The same look as yours back then, right?

06:07.310 --> 06:08.850
If you are that serious,

06:08.850 --> 06:13.350
you should strive for the goal you set for yourself with your own strength.

06:13.350 --> 06:16.550
Or maybe you should talk him into changing his mind when he's back.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.560
I'm not sure if he'll come back.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.930
Whenever I have such experience, I know

06:23.090 --> 06:24.800
that I can't do it with my own hands.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.130
Even if I'm not able to save people's lives,

06:27.130 --> 06:28.630
I can't just watch them die.

06:28.630 --> 06:32.140
It's my fault. I shouldn't have got in.

06:32.140 --> 06:36.940
That way, at least the patient wouldn't have died on his operating table.

06:36.940 --> 06:39.380
Gosh. Since you know that,

06:39.380 --> 06:41.710
why are you still sitting here

06:41.710 --> 06:43.950
and saying things like, "Oh, it's my fault."

06:43.950 --> 06:45.120
Is it the time for that?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.180
If you know it's your fault,

06:46.180 --> 06:47.750
you should try to make things right.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.920
No matter it's you or him,

06:51.920 --> 06:53.220
seeing what you've done,

06:53.220 --> 06:56.730
I really want to punch you guys.

06:56.730 --> 06:58.400
Alright, I'm leaving.

07:04.970 --> 07:07.170
-Oh, is it Go Seung Tak? -The subscriber is not available.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.870
-Where is he? What did he say? -Your call will go to voicemail.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.510
Why is his phone off?

07:11.510 --> 07:13.450
Please answer your phone.

07:14.380 --> 07:17.320
So why did he volunteer to do it?

07:17.320 --> 07:19.680
Did he think he could make a miracle?

07:19.680 --> 07:21.290
He was so arrogant.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.090
He overestimated himself,

07:23.090 --> 07:24.360
and he caused a big trouble as a result.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.820
It's not the time to say that, okay?

07:27.730 --> 07:28.760
If it'd been you guys,

07:28.760 --> 07:29.690
you wouldn't have even dared touch the patient.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.300
You would've watched, and that's it.

07:31.830 --> 07:35.600
At least Go Seung Tak tired his best to save the patient.

07:41.010 --> 07:44.680
The subscriber is not available. Your call will go to voicemail.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.740
Intern O, can you get a hold of Go Seung Tak?

07:46.740 --> 07:47.880
You can't reach him either?

07:48.810 --> 07:51.350
His phone is off, and he hasn't checked his messages.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.620
What's going on with Go Seung Tak?

07:53.620 --> 07:55.620
He went out and has been out of reach.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.460
It wasn't a small accident after all.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.790
I knew he'd make trouble sooner or later.

08:00.430 --> 08:02.560
How could he step up when he can't even tell the difference between poop and pee?

08:02.560 --> 08:03.600
Do you want a beating?

08:03.600 --> 08:04.930
You think doctors are screens?

08:04.930 --> 08:06.830
You think we should only stand aside and watch?

08:06.830 --> 08:09.600
Isn't that what doctors should do, stepping up when there's a patient?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.340
And patients are not poop or pee.

08:16.610 --> 08:17.480
How about hotels?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.780
We are checking the hotels in Seoul right now.

08:19.780 --> 08:20.450
But there's no sign of him so far.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.080
He left his car in the parking lot of the hospital.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.620
So we can't locate him through GPS.

08:24.220 --> 08:26.280
He didn't go home either?

08:26.280 --> 08:27.920
He's not home?

08:33.830 --> 08:34.890
I couldn't reach him either,

08:34.890 --> 08:36.530
so I came here to see if you've found him.

08:36.530 --> 08:38.360
Looks like it was a big blow to him.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.100
But he should at least go home. The elders are all worried about him.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.799
Don't worry too much.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.740
I think he just needs some time.

08:44.740 --> 08:49.010
Seung Tak is much stronger than you think.

08:49.010 --> 08:52.540
He'll get over it and come back bravely.

08:54.180 --> 08:55.080
Thank you.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.280
And don't worry about the operation.

08:57.280 --> 09:01.290
We'll put the needs of the patient's family in the first place,

09:01.290 --> 09:02.890
and take good care of it.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.920
As you know, that's what I'm good at.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.060
Seung Won,

09:11.260 --> 09:13.700
about your uncle, Seung Tak's father,

09:14.770 --> 09:18.840
you know he died for saving Seung Tak's life, right?

09:19.370 --> 09:23.880
I know. Because of the boat accident 20 years ago.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.080
And you also remember that he started

09:26.080 --> 09:29.350
to have those strange symptoms

09:30.350 --> 09:31.780
because of the trauma, right?

09:31.780 --> 09:37.320
Seung Tak used to be an outgoing, thoughtful kid.

09:38.360 --> 09:42.430
How did such a kid go through

09:42.430 --> 09:45.660
all these years after the accident?

09:58.240 --> 09:59.940
I'm scared, Seung Won.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.620
I'm afraid that he'd go to somewhere far away again.

10:09.950 --> 10:11.820
Since your son is so precious to you,

10:11.820 --> 10:13.830
why did you let him become a doctor?

10:14.460 --> 10:17.360
You know very well what a hospital is like.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.730
It never occurred to you that something like this would happen?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.230
Nothing would've happened if you hadn't let him be a doctor.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.740
I did give you a chance.

10:33.580 --> 10:37.050
I know the situation now, but his operation…

10:37.720 --> 10:38.480
If Dr. Go can't do it,

10:38.480 --> 10:40.750
we still have other resident physicians.

10:40.750 --> 10:44.960
But Professor Cha's operation must be performed when Go Seung Tak is around.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.730
Who said that? Chief Ban?

10:48.730 --> 10:51.130
I think so as well.

10:51.130 --> 10:52.060
It's not someone else. It's Professor Cha's operation.

10:53.460 --> 10:56.970
I think we need our genius surgeon Go Seung Tak more than ever.

10:56.970 --> 10:59.270
I know Dr. Go is an excellent surgeon.

10:59.270 --> 11:00.870
But after all it's only his first year as a doctor.

11:00.870 --> 11:01.840
But he's not an ordinary doctor.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.370
His skills can definitely be on a par with the best specialist.

11:03.370 --> 11:05.010
To be honest, he wasn't this good in the beginning.

11:05.010 --> 11:08.110
But after Professor Cha's cardiac tamponade operation, he changed dramatically.

11:08.110 --> 11:12.120
He even completed a very complicated operation all by himself after that. So amazing!

11:21.690 --> 11:26.130
I think it's impossible to blame the chief surgeon for the death of the patient.

11:26.130 --> 11:29.100
After all the doctor did what he was supposed to do when the patient's life was in danger

11:29.100 --> 11:31.970
instead of doing nothing. If you only focus on the death of the patient,

11:31.970 --> 11:33.440
I'm afraid it'll trigger criticism and protest

11:33.440 --> 11:35.370
not only in our hospital, but also in the entire medical field…

11:35.370 --> 11:37.510
People would misunderstand if they heard it.

11:37.510 --> 11:39.080
Don't tackle with it head-on.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.880
Let's explain it from the angle of medical judgment and medical principles.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.120
And the hospital will pay

11:45.120 --> 11:46.680
for the medical bills and funeral expenses.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.250
As for the death benefit… maximize the amount.

11:50.250 --> 11:50.960
Okay.

11:50.960 --> 11:51.820
Got it.

11:51.820 --> 11:55.590
Then how should we deal with Dr. Go Seung Tak's punishment you ordered earlier?

11:55.590 --> 11:58.130
He's done for. Why bother?

11:58.130 --> 11:59.860
Any unnecessary move may cause more trouble.

11:59.860 --> 12:01.330
Just let him go.

12:01.330 --> 12:04.440
He left himself. He won't come back again.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.700
Oh.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.770
Right. He won't come back anymore.

12:08.770 --> 12:13.440
Just wait for him to hand in a resignation letter and that's it.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.680
I was wondering why I felt chills. Turns out you are here.

12:19.350 --> 12:21.850
Oh? You can feel my presence?

12:21.850 --> 12:24.160
Then why don't you open the window and jump out

12:24.160 --> 12:26.020
before I push you down?

12:26.020 --> 12:30.130
Are you going to take this chance to squeeze your cousin out?

12:30.130 --> 12:32.060
I'm afraid it's not the first time you've tried it.

12:32.060 --> 12:34.600
You want to defeat him without lifting a finger, right?

12:35.730 --> 12:37.840
Not me.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.270
It's you, Cha Yeong Min, who destroyed him.

12:41.270 --> 12:41.840
What?

12:41.840 --> 12:43.670
You know that he made me suffer a lot.

12:43.670 --> 12:45.410
But you are the one who broke his wings.

12:45.410 --> 12:48.110
You didn't know when to stop, did you?

12:48.110 --> 12:52.480
He was not a normal kid to begin with. What have you done to him?

12:58.560 --> 13:01.660
Let's make it clear. I didn't make you become like this on purpose.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.290
You became like this because of your bad luck.

13:03.290 --> 13:07.030
Why can't you stop complaining?

13:07.030 --> 13:09.370
And what did Seung Tak ever do wrong?

13:09.370 --> 13:13.400
I don't understand why you always talk about operations.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.570
As it turned out, you ruined my cousin for your personal interests,

13:16.570 --> 13:18.840
and you even

13:18.840 --> 13:21.150
want to put an end to it.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.390
Are you happy now?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.690
No.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.260
I feel like it's the end of the world.

13:37.260 --> 13:40.460
I didn't know he experienced such an unfortunate accident.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.670
I'm concerned about him.

13:41.670 --> 13:43.170
After all, that boy is weak mentally.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.640
I'm afraid he'll get hurt.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.940
I feel so upset.

13:45.940 --> 13:48.510
I want to see him but I can't get out.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.910
Uh, what am I doing here? Darn it!

13:59.080 --> 14:00.750
Anyway,

14:00.750 --> 14:02.220
you get it wrong.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.250
It's not true

14:03.250 --> 14:05.120
that Go Seung Tak has been ruined.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.490
It's impossible to end it this way.

14:06.490 --> 14:07.460
What do you know?

14:07.460 --> 14:10.030
Do you know Go Seung Tak better than I do?

14:11.700 --> 14:13.400
Did you say that Professor Cha's surgery

14:13.400 --> 14:15.830
must be done with Dr. Go around?

14:15.830 --> 14:18.840
Ah, you also know that?

14:18.840 --> 14:19.770
You must have heard about it.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.240
Let me explain.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.710
Though it's his first year,

14:22.710 --> 14:24.840
Dr. Go has become the trump card of our department.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.480
You've never seen it so you'll find it unbelievable.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.180
Have you seen the process

14:29.180 --> 14:31.020
of Dr. Go's surgery yourself?

14:31.020 --> 14:31.750
Of course.

14:31.750 --> 14:32.620
I've seen it

14:32.620 --> 14:34.490
several times.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.560
It's improper to let things like this go public.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.830
Everyone was shocked the day Dr. Go first operated.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.260
Were we bewitched?

14:44.260 --> 14:47.630
Or was Go Seung Tak possessed by a ghost?

14:47.630 --> 14:49.530
It's hard to tell if it only happened once.

14:49.530 --> 14:53.770
But it got more and more…

14:53.770 --> 14:59.440
All sorts of magical medical skills.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.750
It was really an incredible enigma.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.880
It made me doubt if there was really a ghost

15:03.880 --> 15:08.690
or if he was a god from heaven.

15:08.690 --> 15:12.020
Did Dr. Go mention himself that he wanted to do the surgery for Professor Cha?

15:12.020 --> 15:13.060
Of course, he did.

15:13.060 --> 15:14.290
He did more than that.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.660
He cried his eyes out.

15:16.660 --> 15:19.330
He has a strong will to save Professor Cha.

15:19.330 --> 15:22.530
The OR was also prepared by him.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.900
So, anyway,

15:23.900 --> 15:27.000
how about waiting for him a little longer?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.610
If you insist, we can do it too.

15:28.610 --> 15:29.870
I'm full of confidence.

15:29.870 --> 15:30.680
I can guarantee you.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.410
But I want to leave Professor Cha to a top doctor.

15:34.410 --> 15:39.080
Professor Cha is my student. I really cherish and love him.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.950
If you really care about him, why is he still in bed?

15:40.950 --> 15:41.820
What?

15:41.820 --> 15:43.690
I can't wait that long.

15:43.690 --> 15:45.760
If you must have Dr. Go do it,

15:45.760 --> 15:47.660
please get him back soon.

15:47.660 --> 15:50.260
Otherwise, I would ask others for help.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.700
Dr. Go…

15:52.700 --> 15:55.430
will come back.

15:55.430 --> 15:57.900
Though Dr. Go is so mysterious that I can't understand him,

15:57.900 --> 16:00.370
I'm sure of one thing.

16:00.370 --> 16:04.080
He wants to save people more than anyone.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.480
That's why he often makes us feel ashamed.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.970
Professor Cha.

16:34.970 --> 16:36.540
Are you here now?

16:36.540 --> 16:39.310
Could you hear me?

16:41.780 --> 16:46.520
If you can, could you please give me a signal?

16:54.030 --> 16:55.160
I'm sorry.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.630
I didn't break in.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.530
Well, I've knocked.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.330
It's okay.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.070
Are you Dr. O Su Jeong?

17:03.070 --> 17:04.770
Do you know me?

17:04.770 --> 17:07.040
I saw you a few times in the emergency room.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.869
Are you Dr. Go's friend?

17:08.869 --> 17:11.240
I was going to look for you.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.609
Could you get in contact with Dr. Go?

17:13.609 --> 17:16.780
No, I haven't contacted him yet.

17:16.780 --> 17:18.980
I thought you could reach him.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.750
By the way, why are you here?

17:21.750 --> 17:23.290
Oh, right.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.560
Have you had lunch?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.160
I don't know what you like.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.790
So I picked some food convenient for packing.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.030
It seems that my face can stir others' desire to bring me food.

17:35.030 --> 17:35.630
What?

17:35.630 --> 17:37.300
Dr. Go did the same.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.500
He would ask if I had meals when he saw me.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.170
Ah?

17:41.170 --> 17:44.640
Go Seung Tak reminded you to have meals?

17:44.640 --> 17:47.210
I thought he would never do these things.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.350
Nice.

17:49.350 --> 17:52.650
He usually brings me hot soup.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.750
It's strange how he knew it.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.220
Very strange.

17:57.220 --> 18:00.690
He said that soup made him feel full so he didn't like it.

18:00.690 --> 18:03.460
But he knows your preferences so clearly.

18:03.460 --> 18:04.930
What a good man!

18:04.930 --> 18:07.260
He has never bought me any food.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.170
Did you come for him to have lunch with me?

18:12.170 --> 18:14.770
Um, well…

18:14.770 --> 18:17.110
I just feel that I should do something.

18:17.110 --> 18:20.710
It's boring to just stand by and watch.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.980
I can't completely fill his vacancy,

18:23.980 --> 18:25.820
but I can at least do these things.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.490
At this point, it's also a way to comfort him

18:28.490 --> 18:32.260
by expressing his caring for you.

18:32.260 --> 18:34.360
I hope that he won't get angry with me

18:34.360 --> 18:36.660
for I only bought you the simple food.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.600
You are such a good friend.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.530
Oh, it's not a big deal.

18:44.140 --> 18:47.140
As a senior, I make you youngsters so worried.

18:47.140 --> 18:49.440
I feel so ashamed.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.640
Thank you.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.740
I'll enjoy your food.

18:53.740 --> 18:55.650
Dr. Go once said that Professor Cha

18:55.650 --> 18:59.220
would get better only when I took good care of myself.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.750
I believe him.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.420
So I'll take good care of myself.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.520
Please don't worry about me anymore.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.860
Go to help your friend.

19:06.860 --> 19:10.030
He helped me a lot when I had a hard time.

19:10.030 --> 19:11.730
But as you can see, now I…

19:11.730 --> 19:14.200
I have only time and energy for Professor Cha.

19:15.130 --> 19:16.430
Okay, I will.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.270
Let's eat and fight together.

19:18.270 --> 19:20.270
Okay.

19:22.170 --> 19:23.110
Let's enjoy the food.

19:23.110 --> 19:24.140
It looks delicious.

19:24.140 --> 19:27.010
Seung Tak, you have a good friend.

19:27.010 --> 19:29.510
Now I owe more debts to you.

19:29.510 --> 19:33.280
Will a drowning man hang on until someone gets him out?

19:33.280 --> 19:33.780
What?

19:33.780 --> 19:36.220
Patients don't always wait until a doctor comes.

19:36.220 --> 19:39.360
I was afraid when I was a child.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.330
Of course, I would be afraid.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.990
After all, I was only eight then.

19:43.990 --> 19:46.200
Where is the boy? What's he doing?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.170
He must be alone.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.880
I haven't cooked for long. I'm a terrible cook.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.510
Had I known it,

20:03.510 --> 20:05.950
I would have practiced more.

[EunSang University Medical Center]

20:19.800 --> 20:23.600
Why isn't the newcomer here? I'm so sleepy.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.370
Where's Hoon Gil? He said he would stay here with me.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.840
Ahh?

20:34.950 --> 20:35.910
Honey.

20:35.910 --> 20:37.080
You know what?

20:37.080 --> 20:41.320
Hye Jin has submitted applications to various universities.

20:41.320 --> 20:46.060
Ji Won has passed the assessment of a university's professor appointment.

20:46.060 --> 20:48.430
She has just woken up for a few days.

20:48.430 --> 20:51.530
It's okay. You'll catch up with them soon.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.830
You can leave the hospital in two weeks.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.370
If you study harder after that,

20:55.370 --> 20:57.030
you can finish your paper by next spring.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.800
Mom, I'm reading.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.370
Could you stop talking?

21:00.370 --> 21:01.170
What?

21:01.170 --> 21:05.180
I'm saying that your friends are becoming professors.

21:05.180 --> 21:09.150
Aren't you worried that you may get left behind?

21:09.150 --> 21:10.810
When did I ever…

21:10.810 --> 21:13.450
say that I wanted to be a doctor and then a professor?

21:13.450 --> 21:15.390
It's your dream.

21:15.390 --> 21:16.590
You're the one who's worried.

21:16.590 --> 21:18.620
You're afraid that your daughter can't be a doctor.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.790
Great.

21:19.790 --> 21:20.820
Well said!

21:20.820 --> 21:24.130
What's wrong with you recently?

21:24.130 --> 21:26.760
Is it kind of after-effects?

[Henri Bergson]

21:29.730 --> 21:32.100
Did you bring me this book?

21:32.100 --> 21:33.770
How did you know it? Where did you get it?

21:33.770 --> 21:34.440
What?

21:34.440 --> 21:35.610
Isn't it your book?

21:35.610 --> 21:39.580
I just went to your place and took some.

21:41.310 --> 21:43.810
Did Su Mi put it there?

21:48.620 --> 21:49.490
She can't see me.

21:49.490 --> 21:51.990
I'm a ghost. Why am I hiding?

21:57.460 --> 21:59.760
It must be the newcomer who did it.

21:59.760 --> 22:04.130
Mr. Bak would show off again.

22:04.130 --> 22:06.140
Anyway, where is he and what is he doing?

22:06.140 --> 22:08.770
I haven't said my request.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.300
An Tae Hyeon.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.770
Why do you come here?

22:35.770 --> 22:38.200
Aren't you ashamed?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.810
Honey.

22:43.810 --> 22:46.280
How are you these days?

22:48.210 --> 22:51.520
I'm sorry for not coming to see you often.

22:51.520 --> 22:55.090
Jun Yeong went to a basketball match with his friend.

22:55.090 --> 22:57.790
He said his favorite player would come today.

22:57.790 --> 23:00.360
And he let me say sorry to you.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.830
He said he would visit you next time.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.730
Oh, I see.

23:05.730 --> 23:07.300
It's okay.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.170
Of course, he would choose his favorite player.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.030
Who wants to visit a sick father?

23:11.030 --> 23:13.600
He might feel worse to see me like this.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.170
You must be busy.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.540
You don't need to visit me often.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.710
But there's an amazing thing.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.050
I did as it said.

23:22.050 --> 23:24.780
And the taste is the same as what you made.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.750
Jun Yeong likes it very much.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.350
He said it tasted almost the same as yours.

23:27.350 --> 23:29.150
I always sell them out in a short time.

23:29.150 --> 23:29.850
At this rate,

23:29.850 --> 23:32.090
we can be rich very soon.

23:32.660 --> 23:35.790
Is that so? Yeah, great!

23:35.790 --> 23:38.100
Really great.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.560
But…

23:39.560 --> 23:41.030
Did you write this down

23:41.030 --> 23:43.530
for us specially?

23:43.530 --> 23:46.570
It doesn't look like your handwriting.

23:46.570 --> 23:49.440
I don't know where he got this.

23:50.240 --> 23:50.770
You are so…

23:50.770 --> 23:52.310
Since it's for us, why didn't you give it to us earlier

23:52.310 --> 23:54.680
or teach me step by step directly?

23:54.680 --> 23:57.510
If so, we wouldn't have been driven out by others.

23:57.510 --> 24:00.520
That's because I didn't want you to suffer.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.620
I wanted to take everything by myself.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.530
Honey.

24:16.570 --> 24:22.470
You worked so hard to buy that shop.

24:26.310 --> 24:27.680
I'm sorry.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.610
I failed to keep it in our hands.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.960
I'm the one who should say sorry.

24:41.860 --> 24:44.730
It's all my fault. I made you suffer.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.400
I'm really sorry, honey.

24:49.170 --> 24:51.300
But again, that person was quite funny.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.500
He said that you were waiting for us

24:52.500 --> 24:54.240
and asked me to bring our son to visit you.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.440
Who did he think he was?

24:57.140 --> 25:00.240
I wanted to say thank you to him.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.380
It turned out that he had a day off today.

25:03.380 --> 25:05.720
Oh, you are talking about the new doctor.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.820
I will convey it for you.

25:21.870 --> 25:26.270
Here comes our trump card.

25:26.270 --> 25:29.110
Dr. An, it's been long.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.880
What's going on? What do you want?

25:37.150 --> 25:39.720
What can I do for you?

25:39.720 --> 25:42.420
Dr. An, it's time to reinstate you in your post.

25:42.420 --> 25:43.190
What?

25:43.190 --> 25:43.990
Sure.

25:43.990 --> 25:45.760
How could a doctor as highly skilled as Dr. An

25:45.760 --> 25:47.930
take such a long rest?

25:47.930 --> 25:49.890
It's said that if a doctor rests for too long,

25:49.890 --> 25:51.830
his hands will rust.

25:51.830 --> 25:53.800
Right?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.570
There happens to be a doctor now

25:55.570 --> 25:56.400
who has an important operation to perform

25:56.400 --> 25:57.830
but left without permission.

25:57.830 --> 26:00.400
The patient urgently needs you to operate.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.340
A patient in urgent need of surgery?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.680
What kind of patient…

26:05.680 --> 26:06.810
Cha Yeong Min.

26:06.810 --> 26:07.440
What?

26:07.440 --> 26:10.380
Are you asking me to operate on Professor Cha?

26:10.380 --> 26:12.420
It doesn't matter who he is.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.150
What matters is the surgery itself.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.420
What do you mean…

26:15.420 --> 26:17.350
Not long ago, a patient died

26:17.350 --> 26:19.760
during the process of surgery.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.020
But people say that

26:21.020 --> 26:26.000
it's an irreversible situation in order to save the patient's life.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.130
Besides, dangerous things happen

26:28.130 --> 26:29.570
when doctors perform surgery,

26:29.570 --> 26:32.040
some of which cause death.

Anything wrong?

26:33.840 --> 26:36.310

26:36.310 --> 26:40.080
Then please resume your post and finish your first operation.

26:42.010 --> 26:44.280
Why are you telling me this here…

26:44.280 --> 26:45.820
What?

26:45.820 --> 26:48.450
Are you afraid that he's looking at you?

26:48.450 --> 26:49.790
Even if he is, so what?

26:49.790 --> 26:51.190
What can he do?

26:51.190 --> 26:53.990

26:55.730 --> 26:58.060
Well, what's that?

26:58.060 --> 27:00.030
Oh, this.

This is a reinstatement gift

27:09.310 --> 27:11.810
let's open it and celebrate.

27:11.810 --> 27:14.280
Don't screw it up like last time.

27:14.280 --> 27:17.280
And don't leave any evidence.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.290

27:22.290 --> 27:23.720
It's really good wine.

27:47.010 --> 27:49.950
I suppose he might be there now.

27:53.050 --> 27:55.720
could you tell him I'd like to meet him?

27:55.720 --> 27:59.060
There's something I'd like to ask him in person.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.630
Excuse me.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.690

28:35.690 --> 28:36.930

Come with me while I can negotiate.

28:53.410 --> 28:55.250
Why are you still here?

28:56.980 --> 28:58.120
Just put something on and get out of here.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.220
I'm an intern and I don't have much free time.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.090
Is it Dr. Jang or Nurse Jeong

29:05.090 --> 29:06.120
who wants to see me?

29:06.120 --> 29:07.790
Dr. Jang.

29:07.790 --> 29:09.330
She said if you didn't want to come with me,

29:09.330 --> 29:11.900
I would drag you and take you back.

29:11.900 --> 29:15.030
How did she know I was good at it?

29:15.430 --> 29:16.730
I hear it's all sorted out, right?

29:16.730 --> 29:19.240
Well, all that's left is me.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.870
I have my written resignation in the living room.

29:21.870 --> 29:24.880
Submit it for me.

29:24.880 --> 29:28.210
I'm sick and tired of all the calls.

29:30.010 --> 29:32.350
I wonder if this one is OK.

29:32.350 --> 29:34.720
This style is not good enough.

29:35.820 --> 29:39.160
Do you know I had a crush on you?

29:40.220 --> 29:41.160
What?

29:41.160 --> 29:43.290
You ran up to me in your doctor's uniform,

29:43.290 --> 29:45.500
happily saying that the patient was saved,

29:45.500 --> 29:46.160
and I thought you were very handsome.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.330
I can see you're genuinely happy.

29:47.330 --> 29:48.700
Every time I see you like that,

29:48.700 --> 29:50.970
my heart is pounding, too.

29:51.940 --> 29:55.410

29:57.710 --> 29:59.940
how happy he would be.

He died 20 years ago.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.380
When he died,

30:07.380 --> 30:10.950
he saved a little child.

30:10.950 --> 30:12.760
So, I feel even sadder.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.460
Because that little child is here right now and I'm so worried about him.

What are you talking about?

30:18.700 --> 30:20.530

There are so many doctors in this hospital,

30:34.880 --> 30:37.310
they'll do the surgery.

30:37.310 --> 30:40.280
Professor Jang is waiting for you, too.

31:11.010 --> 31:13.720
Do you think the situation was the same as it is now?

31:13.720 --> 31:14.580
It was the same with Hoon Gil.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.320
I disagree. Why do you still talk so much?

would the patient have survived?

56:49.990 --> 56:51.820
Do not touch the patient.

56:52.750 --> 56:53.890
Dr. Go.

56:53.890 --> 56:55.660
Do you want to go to another hospital?

56:56.590 --> 56:58.790
You brat, why are you here so late?

56:58.790 --> 57:00.000
You kept me waiting and I'm gonna die.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.330
Is your judgment on me still valid?

57:02.330 --> 57:03.270
Of course.

57:03.270 --> 57:04.030
OK.

57:04.030 --> 57:06.070
Then just stay here.

57:06.070 --> 57:07.370
Stay by my side

57:10.240 --> 57:11.440
Stay with me.

57:22.920 --> 57:26.150
[20 years ago]

57:36.900 --> 57:37.770
Cut.

57:40.570 --> 57:42.500
Wow, Professor O,

57:42.500 --> 57:44.140
you are so good.

57:44.140 --> 57:46.580
Professor, the surgery is perfect.

57:47.640 --> 57:48.740
Thank you for your effort.

57:48.740 --> 57:50.210
Ah, well...

57:51.110 --> 57:52.550
Dr. Ban Tae Sik.

57:52.550 --> 57:53.380
Yes.

57:53.380 --> 57:57.790
Come to my operating room when you have time.

57:58.820 --> 58:03.020
Fill in the missing parts one by one,

58:03.020 --> 58:04.730
and it will become better.

58:05.990 --> 58:07.700
Thank you so much, professor.

58:07.700 --> 58:09.630
I'll work hard and learn.

58:12.630 --> 58:14.200
Are you feeling unwell?

58:15.240 --> 58:16.840
No, no.

58:16.840 --> 58:19.770
I'll look after the patient, and you can go back and rest.

58:19.770 --> 58:20.980
You didn't come home yesterday.

58:20.980 --> 58:22.580
No, no need.

58:22.580 --> 58:25.910
I have to see the patient wake up and then I can go back.

58:34.620 --> 58:35.860
Oh.

58:37.230 --> 58:39.760
Oh, my princess.

58:40.900 --> 58:46.200
Well, grandpa will go back after seeing the patient.

58:46.200 --> 58:47.100
What?

58:48.300 --> 58:49.370
Well...

58:50.570 --> 58:53.140
You are gonna stay up and wait for me, right?

58:56.080 --> 58:57.710
Of course.

58:57.710 --> 59:05.250
Of course, grandpa bought the chocolate cake that our princess likes.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.120
AVG check again in an hour.

59:08.120 --> 59:09.960
If anything happens, call me.

59:09.960 --> 59:11.060
OK.

59:13.130 --> 59:14.060
Hello.

59:14.060 --> 59:16.260
We don't have a professor who can do the surgery.

59:16.260 --> 59:18.170
Can you transfer the patient to another hospital?

59:18.170 --> 59:19.570
What kind of patient is it?

59:20.240 --> 59:21.340
Just a minute.

59:21.340 --> 59:23.100
It's a patient with descending aortic aneurysm,

59:21.870 --> 59:25.740
[Descending aortic aneurysm
Impending rupture]

59:23.100 --> 59:24.370
and impending rupture.

59:24.370 --> 59:27.140
For impending rupture, even if the vital signs are fine,

59:27.140 --> 59:29.280
there will be problems along the way.

59:30.280 --> 59:32.750
I'll go down and see. You let them admit the patient.

59:32.750 --> 59:34.320
Then contact the anesthesiologist

59:34.320 --> 59:35.680
to book the operating room.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.890
Understood.

59:36.890 --> 59:38.750
OK, send the patient here.

59:46.330 --> 59:49.600
Do you believe in God?

59:51.330 --> 59:53.300
Even if an atheist

59:53.300 --> 59:58.210
will also earnestly seek God at some point,

59:58.210 --> 1:00:03.040
in order to come in handy at that time, we have doctors.

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:06.510
What would happen if the doctor ignored the patient?

1:00:07.620 --> 1:00:09.750
For what a ghost can't do,

1:00:09.750 --> 1:00:15.920
a living person must do his duty well.

1:00:34.910 --> 1:00:36.480
Oh,

1:00:38.010 --> 1:00:40.750

She said she would wait for grandpa to come back and kept crying and couldn't sleep.

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:52.090
Dad, she's asleep now.

1:00:53.930 --> 1:00:57.130
Gee, I'm late again.

1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:34.040
Grandpa didn't keep the promise again.

1:02:10.210 --> 1:02:11.240
Professor.

1:02:14.780 --> 1:02:18.550
Oh, you're working overtime again.

Well, are you asleep?

1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:10.200
The patient with descending aortic aneurysm.

1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:12.030
Are the myocardial enzyme results confirmed?

1:03:12.030 --> 1:03:13.270
Not yet.

1:03:13.270 --> 1:03:14.240
Cheer up, you brat.

1:03:15.970 --> 1:03:16.770
You can't afford that.

1:03:16.770 --> 1:03:17.770
Yes.

Thanks for waiting for me.

If God is too busy,

they hope even the moment a ghost appears to help.
