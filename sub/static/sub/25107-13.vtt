00:11.469 --> 00:13.346
<i>Now, the story of a wealthy family</i>

00:13.430 --> 00:16.349
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:18.184
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:24.149 --> 00:25.859
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.452
Gotta avoid the sun.

00:35.994 --> 00:36.870
Right there.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.999
Sorry, Gob. Looks like there
isn't gonna be enough for you.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.960
I never should have done Lindsay first.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.087
Lindsay's having a widening spurt.

00:46.171 --> 00:49.674
Please, I don't need any suntan lotion.
Dad never wears any.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.469
Yeah. And he's doing fine
in the lady department.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.221
- Oh.
- Well, Buster doesn't know

00:55.305 --> 00:57.557
what the hell he's talking about!

00:59.476 --> 01:02.270
I think Buster was actually talking
about Mom.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.985
Oh, yes. No, uh... I thought...

01:09.069 --> 01:11.780
you were talking about recent...
Yes, thank you.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.992
Yes, she is, uh...
She is quite the beauty.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.788
You kids have a lot of competition

01:19.871 --> 01:21.623
for this year's family pageant.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.667
Who is going to be...

01:25.168 --> 01:28.463
Mr. and Mrs. Bluth 1982?

01:28.546 --> 01:30.465
Oh!

01:33.093 --> 01:34.469
It's always you guys.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.222
We don't have a chance.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.476
Well, that's the downside
of having a mother who never ages.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.980
It must be something in these cigarettes.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.775
It doesn't hurt
that you guys are the judges.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.861
- They are?
- You guys are the judges?

01:55.323 --> 01:56.699
I knew this day would come.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.910
Maybe it is time.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.329
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay, uh...

02:01.412 --> 02:04.165
Kids, your mother and I have discussed it,

02:04.249 --> 02:07.502
and you're all old enough now
to actually impress us,

02:08.211 --> 02:09.169
so...

02:13.258 --> 02:14.801
...we're out of the running.

02:14.884 --> 02:17.345
But that means
you need to step up your efforts

02:17.428 --> 02:18.930
in the talent portion.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.515
I already know what I'm doing.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.392
And it can't just be push-ups.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.353
Yeah, it won't just be push-ups.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.482
So, good luck,
everyone, in the pageant.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.860
I'm sure you'll all be thin
by Thursday, Lindsay.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.696
- Out you go.
- Although, not so fast.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.657
You have to wait
until your brother Buster's hooked up.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.660
Oh, come on.
He still has to wear that dog collar?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.412
It's not a dog collar.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.956
- It's Buster's Gentleman Collar.
- Gentleman Collar.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.541
And he barely even knows it's there.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.334
Yeah, I barely know it's...

02:51.212 --> 02:53.423
Well, he's grown a little.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.884
Hey, wait.
You're in your suits already?

02:55.967 --> 02:59.053
I thought you were gonna wait for me
before you went swimming.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.765
It's not my fault
you're so greedy for a paycheck.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.225
I was covering your shift.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.270
- Oh, yeah. Pay up.
- Too late.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.231
I already spent your pay on this.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.158 --> 03:22.911
You bought me a dorky, lame, stupid,

03:23.161 --> 03:24.412
gay magic kit?

03:24.954 --> 03:27.040
What? No. This is for me.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.250
I got it for the Mr. Bluth Talent Pageant.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.211
This is gonna be my talent.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.006
Does it come with that bird?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.675
No, I gotta get a bird.
But I'll get a bird.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.136
Can I see?
Almost there...

03:40.762 --> 03:42.972
Didn't Buster used to get past the window?

03:43.348 --> 03:45.058
Mom tightened it
when he tried to put

03:45.141 --> 03:46.726
that starfish in his mouth.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.938
Yeah, but he's had a good summer.
He's made friends.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.191
Actually, Mother made the friend for me.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.778
So I named it after her: Lucille Ball.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.157
Is anybody else worried she's ruining us?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.247
Take that back!
You take that back!

04:07.330 --> 04:09.999
- We're normal! We're normal!
- Okay. Down, down.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.335
- Easy, Buster. Easy, boy.
- Sit.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.089
Okay, well, you guys wait for me.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.589
I'm gonna go change into my suit.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.677
I would say wait for me,
but it might be a couple of years.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.264
Hey, uh, Michael...

04:24.931 --> 04:28.017
I think Buster wants to go take a swim.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.020
I do!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.064
I've never even got my suit wet
from the outside.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.275
And I'm looking to turn that around,
buddy.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.860
If you're talking
about Buster going into the ocean,

04:37.944 --> 04:39.404
that is a terrible idea.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.490
Besides,
Mom puts that stupid collar on him

04:42.573 --> 04:44.450
every time he puts on his bathing suit.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.035
No. Not every time.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.371
He doesn't wear it
during the swimsuit competition

04:48.454 --> 04:49.956
of the Mr. Bluth Pageant.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.040
Sit.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.127
By the way, guess who it turns out
the judges really are?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.212
It's not Mom and Dad?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.049
Magic is for girls.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.552
And your bird's gonna die, Michael.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.807
And when it does, it'll go back to...
whence it came.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.228
Back to whence it came.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.653
<i>The Bluths were waiting</i>
<i>for information</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739
<i>from Michael and their attorney</i>

05:22.947 --> 05:25.199
<i>after having made the news again.</i>

05:25.700 --> 05:27.410
<i>Viewers, it was the graphic scene</i>

05:27.493 --> 05:29.579
behind <i>the graphics</i>
<i>that caught the attention</i>

05:29.662 --> 05:33.583
<i>of a sharp-eyed viewer
who saw something and said something.</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:36.252
<i>On the top of a stair car
the police are calling</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:39.088
<i>a "vehicle of interest,"
an alleged man, now identified</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:40.715
<i>as Byron Buster Bluth,</i>

05:40.798 --> 05:43.801
<i>can be seen dropping
a large person-type thing</i>

05:43.885 --> 05:45.053
<i>into the water below.</i>

05:45.136 --> 05:47.847
<i>Police think this may be a clue
to the disappearance</i>

05:47.930 --> 05:52.018
<i>of Lucille Austero, with whom the suspect
had a long and rocky relationship.</i>

05:52.101 --> 05:55.938
<i>Mr. Bluth was arrested last night
in an elevator in Newport.</i>

05:56.147 --> 05:57.732
<i>It seems the Bluth Family...</i>

05:57.815 --> 05:59.442
<i>And the family found themselves</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:02.362
<i>in the last place
they ever expected to be:</i>

06:02.445 --> 06:03.446
<i>a police station.</i>

06:03.529 --> 06:05.448
I never seem to get an end seat.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.576
This is what happens
when you're richand white in America.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.370
You happen to be caught on video,

06:10.453 --> 06:13.956
dumping some large person-type thing
into the bay,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.000
and nobody thinks, "I wonder how long

06:16.084 --> 06:18.169
that guy has been working
for the real killer?"

06:18.252 --> 06:21.255
Yeah, and they jumped right
to "He's the killer,"

06:21.339 --> 06:22.632
and then don't think to add:

06:22.715 --> 06:25.301
"but it's nice he's giving
the help the night off."

06:25.635 --> 06:28.179
No, they're jealous. They are jealous.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.474
And they won't stop
until one of us is a murderer.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.892
Today, it's Buster.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.561
Tomorrow... No, I guess it'll stop today.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.438
- Today's the last day.
- Come on.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.065
Let's all get on the same side here.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.775
We need to be all together on this.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.902
Yeah, I... I think that's a wonderful idea.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.447
And really,
we're just asking this Asian gentleman

06:46.531 --> 06:48.491
and his wife...?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.743
To move over
to that group of chairs there,

06:51.035 --> 06:52.787
freeing up the end seat,

06:52.870 --> 06:54.872
which I would love
to take a shot at sitting in.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.333
Okay, it is not great news.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.376
Sorry.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.627
To finish the thought,

07:00.044 --> 07:02.422
that would free up this whole area
of seats for us.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.715
From the "If You See Something,
Say Something" poster

07:04.799 --> 07:07.176
- to the payphone.
- Tobias, please.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.721
- What did you find out?
- My friend spoke to the DA's office,

07:10.805 --> 07:13.182
and my lawyers were able
to reduce my sentence

07:13.266 --> 07:15.059
to time served. Bad news?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.062
I can't spend any time
with anybody under 25.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.522
About Buster.

07:20.606 --> 07:24.986
And... they officially charged him
with murder. First degree.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.362
- Mm...
- First degree?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.073
- They don't even have a body.
- Yes,

07:29.157 --> 07:31.159
but they have his fingerprints
and her blood

07:31.242 --> 07:33.870
all over the stair car, which was supposed
to be missing in Mexico.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.414
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was a picture of the stair car</i>

07:36.497 --> 07:39.417
<i>at the border
that dismantled the DA's case</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:42.170
<i>by showing the missing victim
along with Oscar...</i>

07:42.253 --> 07:43.421
...alibi and what we...

07:43.504 --> 07:45.423
<i>...that Michael had used</i>
<i>to get the DA</i>

07:45.506 --> 07:48.342
<i>to release Buster from jail
in the first place.</i>

07:48.426 --> 07:50.094
- We did.
<i>- And even though the picture</i>

07:50.178 --> 07:52.263
<i>turned out to be just George Michael
and Maeby</i>

07:52.346 --> 07:54.765
<i>dressing up as two of their heroes</i>

07:54.849 --> 07:58.186
<i>before abandoning the broken-down truck
in Mexico,</i>

07:58.269 --> 08:01.898
<i>the forensic evidence on a stair car
that served as the crime scene...</i>

08:01.981 --> 08:03.316
Okay, evidence guy, we're done.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.027
<i>...of the conjectured murder
was kept safely</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:07.403
<i>out of the country...</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:09.780
Because you don't know DropBox?
That's not my job.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.075
<i>...as was Oscar,</i>
<i>who </i> wasn't <i>with Lucille 2.</i>

08:13.367 --> 08:14.577
Because that's the evidence...

08:14.660 --> 08:17.747
<i>But who, after hearing news</i>
<i>that Buster had been arrested,</i>

08:17.997 --> 08:20.082
<i>went to the vehicle he'd hidden away</i>

08:20.166 --> 08:22.877
<i>after finding it abandoned weeks earlier,</i>

08:24.128 --> 08:26.255
<i>before driving it back into the States</i>

08:26.339 --> 08:28.132
<i>to pick up his son, Buster...</i>

08:28.216 --> 08:31.511
<i>...a man who would soon be implored
by his magician brother</i>

08:32.385 --> 08:34.222
<i>to help him conceal the secrets</i>

08:34.304 --> 08:35.972
<i>- of a magic trick.</i>
- ...body-shaped thing.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.100
- What is that?
<i>- It was only after doing so</i>

08:38.183 --> 08:40.811
<i>that Oscar decided to be the latest Bluth</i>

08:40.895 --> 08:43.856
<i>to abandon a stair car,
unfortunately doing so</i>

08:43.940 --> 08:45.024
<i>in a parking spot</i>

08:45.358 --> 08:47.443
<i>that had only recently been assigned</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:50.154
<i>to evidence supervisor Eddie Cantrow.</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:52.865
- Evidence parking only.
<i>- Who, before realizing</i>

08:52.949 --> 08:56.077
<i>that he was looking
at damaging evidence against Buster,</i>

08:56.494 --> 08:59.664
<i>reacted poorly...</i>

08:59.747 --> 09:01.832
<i>...damaging the evidence against Buster.</i>

09:01.916 --> 09:04.377
- Son of a bitch!
<i>- In fairness to him,</i>

09:04.460 --> 09:06.462
<i>it had taken him a super long time to get</i>

09:06.546 --> 09:09.757
<i>a decent parking spot that he didn't have
to walk, like, a mile from.</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:13.219
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>someone tampered with the evidence.</i>

09:13.302 --> 09:15.471
But, look, even without it,
they still have the video

09:15.555 --> 09:18.015
of him dumping something
in the bay that night.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.060
And... And did he say
what it was that he dumped?

09:21.811 --> 09:24.272
Or who gave him whatever
what it was that he dumped?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.066
Or where that guy,
not the first guy but the second guy

09:27.149 --> 09:28.985
who gave him what he dumped,

09:29.610 --> 09:31.821
got... what it was that he dumped?

09:31.904 --> 09:33.197
Not this time.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.575
No, we... we didn't have him say anything.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.120
I said, "Don't say a word.
Put on your poker face."

09:39.203 --> 09:41.122
<i>Although Buster's poker face</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:44.917
<i>didn't really make him look
like less of a murderer.</i>

09:45.501 --> 09:46.627
Poker face.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.797
<i>How could this be happening?</i>

09:50.089 --> 09:53.217
Buster couldn't have done this.
I raised him totally by the book.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.469
Mom, you had him on a leash
until he was six.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.680
Well,
if that leash screwed him up so badly,

09:58.180 --> 09:59.890
why does he still want to wear it?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.643
Guys, it's not time
to play the blame game, okay?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.062
Even though they do say, in most cases,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.481
something happens in childhood
and, usually, the person

10:07.565 --> 10:09.191
that raises them is to blame.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.152
- But that's experts.
- I see.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.446
Don't you try to pin this on Lupe.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.573
She had her own family to raise, too.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.825
Boy,
Mom brings up a very good point.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.369
No one should say anything publicly
about this.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.622
I should speak for the family.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.624
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.709
- Who said it should be you?
- Well,

10:26.792 --> 10:28.586
I'm in the family,
and it's gonna be crazy.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.254
It's gonna be a media circus, Tobias.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.632
Then I should be its ringmaster.

10:32.715 --> 10:36.093
<i>In fact, Tobias would've taken</i>
<i>any job at that moment,</i>

10:36.177 --> 10:40.514
<i>as his current living arrangement
was tense, indeed.</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:51.651
<i>Something that is really only clear</i>

10:51.734 --> 10:54.570
<i>without the quick editing
and carefree score.</i>

10:55.696 --> 10:57.156
Who did that? Who did that?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.866
- I was trying to be funny.
- Yeah?

10:58.949 --> 11:01.077
How 'bout I put your head
through this glass table?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.578
How funny would that be, young man?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.704
Oh, try it, Dad!

11:03.788 --> 11:05.331
I would so love that!

11:05.414 --> 11:07.708
- I did not raise you to say the F-word!
- Everybody's tired!

11:07.792 --> 11:10.294
We've all had
too much pain medication.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.171
There were six.
There were six in here.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.006
Who the took 'em?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.925
- Why would you take these?
- I didn't take 'em!

11:16.008 --> 11:17.885
- How dare you, young lady!
- Hey, stop yelling!

11:18.135 --> 11:20.221
- I hate it when you guys fight!
- I've had enough of all

11:20.304 --> 11:22.264
- of you guys. Hey.
- I've had enough of you.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.142
- I'll break her neck.
<i>- Let's get that music back on.</i>

11:29.939 --> 11:33.234
As you see, it's latex,
so it can go right up your ass.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.361
<i>Someone from this family needs</i>

11:35.444 --> 11:37.196
to speak for Buster.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.865
Who is Buster Bluth?

11:40.116 --> 11:41.617
A young, one-armed,

11:41.992 --> 11:45.705
Iraq War vet suffering from PTSD,

11:45.788 --> 11:48.582
raised by a young mother
who had him at 17,

11:48.666 --> 11:50.251
whose only flaw was that...

11:50.710 --> 11:53.295
she loved him... too much.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.881
Actually, I was 37.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.425
Well, no one would believe that.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.678
- You're hired.
- No, you're not. Mom,

12:00.761 --> 12:02.471
- I'll handle this.
- Oh, Michael,

12:02.555 --> 12:05.725
let's be honest. Every time
you handle things, they're mishandled.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.977
Yeah, your mom's right. I mean, lately,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.562
you're just doing everything badly.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.356
- Yeah, Dad, nail his ass.
- I'll pile on

12:12.440 --> 12:14.024
to nailing that ass, Dad.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.902
S... So, now that we've gotten

12:16.986 --> 12:19.864
Tobias completely ruled out as ringmaster,

12:19.947 --> 12:23.242
maybe we can talk about Buster
and maybe getting him a lawyer.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.119
Oh! I should have led with this.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.495
I have been officially disbarred.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.122
I can't handle Buster's case

12:28.205 --> 12:30.374
or anybody under 25.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.960
Saves me an awkward conversation.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.921
I think we need to get Buster
the best criminal lawyer available.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.173
- Looking for the best?
- Yeah.

12:37.256 --> 12:41.343
Well, if you're looking for the best,
there is only one group to go to.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.471
They're called the Guilty Guys.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.307
<i>In fact, they were five</i>
<i>of the most prestigious attorneys</i>

12:46.390 --> 12:47.725
<i>in Orange County.</i>

12:47.808 --> 12:49.310
<i>There was Anita Bramwell,</i>

12:49.393 --> 12:51.729
<i>a researcher as tough as a prosecutor,</i>

12:51.812 --> 12:54.148
<i>whose photographic memory
was the perfect complement</i>

12:54.231 --> 12:56.400
<i>to her photogenic good looks.</i>

12:56.901 --> 12:59.528
<i>When it came to writing briefs,
Garrison "Harvard" Sweet</i>

12:59.612 --> 13:01.030
<i>was as elegant on the page</i>

13:01.113 --> 13:03.115
<i>as he was clumsy on the dance floor.</i>

13:03.199 --> 13:05.034
<i>But in both cases, he wasn't afraid</i>

13:05.117 --> 13:06.660
<i>to step on a few toes.</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:08.871
<i>Trained by the FBI in forensics,</i>

13:08.954 --> 13:11.540
<i>Shara Winfield not only knew
the science of law,</i>

13:11.624 --> 13:13.125
<i>but the laws of science.</i>

13:13.209 --> 13:17.046
<i>She was an expert who wasn't afraid
to get a little DNA on her.</i>

13:17.630 --> 13:20.090
<i>With a state supreme court justice
as a father,</i>

13:20.174 --> 13:21.967
<i>Jack Griffin had more to prove</i>

13:22.051 --> 13:24.261
<i>than most upper-tier
Dartmouth law students.</i>

13:24.345 --> 13:25.846
<i>He wasn't too proud to take money</i>

13:25.930 --> 13:27.973
<i>and a country club membership
from his parents.</i>

13:28.057 --> 13:29.600
<i>But he made it to the top of the list</i>

13:29.683 --> 13:31.769
<i>by being just that good.</i>

13:31.852 --> 13:33.896
<i>And hailing
from the mean streets of Oakland</i>

13:33.979 --> 13:36.440
<i>comes a lawyer raised
by a single mother</i>

13:36.524 --> 13:38.859
<i>who taught him the meaning
of justice, Jesus,</i>

13:38.943 --> 13:40.861
<i>and when to not follow the rules.</i>

13:40.945 --> 13:44.240
<i>David G. "G-Man" Barnes cared about</i>

13:44.323 --> 13:45.866
<i>but one thing above the law:</i>

13:46.242 --> 13:47.910
<i>his beloved Raiders.</i>

13:47.993 --> 13:49.662
<i>These five professionals</i>

13:49.745 --> 13:52.540
<i>had a perfect record
defending real criminals</i>

13:52.623 --> 13:54.542
<i>who'd done real crimes.</i>

13:54.625 --> 13:58.420
<i>Together, they were known as
the Guilty Guys.</i>

13:58.504 --> 14:01.006
<i>And I think I might have gotten
Jack and David mixed up.</i>

14:01.090 --> 14:02.424
<i>Very expensive</i>

14:02.508 --> 14:03.551
but very, very good,

14:03.634 --> 14:05.970
especially if you're guilty.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.805
He's not guilty.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.975
- Then I would go with the cheaper option.
- Unacceptable.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.351
We want the best.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.145
Well, how are we gonna pay for that?
We don't have any money.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.566
It's all tied up in Fakeblock.
Thanks, Michael.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.110
"Thanks, <i>Michael"?</i>
How 'bout a little thanks

14:21.193 --> 14:23.445
to the guy who drove the stock price up

14:23.529 --> 14:26.031
and ended up screwing over
those other guys?

14:26.115 --> 14:28.826
Who ended up being us. Thanks, Michael.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.745
- Fakeblock's got nothing to do with this.
- Thanks, Michael.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.707
That's right.
Because when we sell Fakeblock,

14:34.790 --> 14:36.750
we give the money right back
to the Chinese

14:36.834 --> 14:38.377
before they get angrier.

14:38.794 --> 14:39.879
Angrier?

14:39.962 --> 14:42.214
I didn't tell you,
but they left a message

14:42.298 --> 14:45.009
saying that they hope their gift
was enough to...

14:45.301 --> 14:47.261
"get us back on our feet."

14:47.553 --> 14:49.972
They're... They're threatening our feet?

14:52.349 --> 14:54.768
You don't think these Chinese
would first try to, I don't know,

14:54.852 --> 14:57.146
- ding your credit rating?
- It's their culture.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.774
Dusty was right.
I will say this for Saddam Hussein.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.277
With him, you didn't have to guess.
It was very direct.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.738
"I'll chop this off, I'll chop that off."

15:05.821 --> 15:07.990
Right. With him, you knew where you stood.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.366
Or... Or couldn't.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.911
Well, the Chinese clearly know
we spent the money.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.247
We're gonna have to sell Fakeblock,
so we can find a way to build the wall.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.666
Guys, we... we're not selling Fakeblock,
okay?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.794
We're gonna be able to find the money
to pay for these great lawyers, all right?

15:20.878 --> 15:23.631
I've already identified a couple
of assets that we can part with.

15:23.714 --> 15:24.798
Yeah, anything, Michael.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.342
We should sell the beach house.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.017
This is why we never told you
about the beach house, Michael.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.852
Uh, can I add something?

15:37.811 --> 15:40.856
This is why we never told you
about the beach house.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.941
Let's roll.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.780
<i>Days later,</i>
<i>Michael was back at the office,</i>

15:47.863 --> 15:51.325
<i>trying to get a sense of how soon
Fakeblock would be turning a profit.</i>

15:51.408 --> 15:54.328
Sorry, stranger, I only have time
for future billionaires.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.163
Oh, it's you.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.248
- Bingo.
- Uh, this...

15:58.332 --> 16:00.084
this was delivered
to our office by mistake.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.461
But it says "Bluth Company,"
so I thought I'd bring it.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.254
Mailman mistake, huh?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.382
Hard to believe we have those
in this analog world.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.801
Hey, speaking of that,
how's it going down there?

16:08.884 --> 16:10.219
- It's good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:10.302 --> 16:12.846
Gob has been on lunch... most of today.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.556
- Most of the week...
- Huh.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.849
- ...actually...
- Yeah, listen,

16:15.933 --> 16:17.685
Gob only cares about himself.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.311
But I'm glad to get you up here,
because,

16:19.395 --> 16:21.522
as I say, we need that software.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.441
I mean, no pressure, but the lawyers
are charging a lot of money

16:24.692 --> 16:25.693
down there.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.028
- Oh, did you hire them?
- Oh, yeah.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.072
<i>And the billable hours</i>
<i>were coming in,</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:32.825
<i>as the Guilty Guys
were finishing their first week</i>

16:32.908 --> 16:36.537
<i>- of leaving no stone unturned.</i>
- So there's no doubt in your mind?

16:36.620 --> 16:37.746
None whatsoever.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.249
There's no way the killer was Ann Veal.
No match.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.209
- That's right.
- DNA don't lie.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.877
Take her off the board.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.713
- Got it.
- Run those files

16:45.796 --> 16:49.091
and our billing for it over
to the Bluth Company and pronto.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.803
<i>I mean, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>$7,000 to find out</i>

16:52.886 --> 16:55.514
<i>that Ann Veal had nothing to do
with Buster's case?</i>

16:55.597 --> 16:57.725
Frankly, I'd ask you to bring
your rich girlfriend on

16:57.808 --> 17:00.561
as a business associate,
but I respect your space.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.770
Unless maybe...

17:02.271 --> 17:03.230
we give it a shot?

17:03.856 --> 17:04.857
Ship sailed on that or...?

17:06.775 --> 17:08.444
It's... It's difficult, actually,

17:08.527 --> 17:09.862
because I'm trying to figure out

17:09.944 --> 17:11.989
whether her father can even be trusted.

17:12.070 --> 17:13.906
It's difficult for me
to find that balance...

17:13.991 --> 17:15.951
<i>Oh, that's not why he can't ask her.</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:18.746
<i>I wasn't even going to put this in,
but here's why.</i>

17:18.829 --> 17:20.664
You sold the company?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.459
- A little.
- You can't sell a company a little.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.544
That's like saying
you're a little bit tired.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.921
You don't think you can be
a little bit tired?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.923
My dad was gonna invest
in your company.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.800
I was gonna invest in your company.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.595
Then, suddenly,
you go behind my back and have sold it.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.764
- You clearly don't trust me.
- I do trust you.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.684
I just didn't want Fakeblock
to get in the way of our relationship.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.853
Well, now it's not gonna get
in the way of anything.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.688
Anything? I mean, so...

17:45.522 --> 17:46.523
it's over now?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.442
A little.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.111
<i>But not wanting to make</i>
<i>his father feel guilty,</i>

17:51.195 --> 17:53.030
<i>George Michael kept this to himself.</i>

17:53.113 --> 17:55.240
<i>I'm trying to get</i>
<i>a timeline on when profits</i>

17:55.324 --> 17:57.785
from the Fakeblock business
and so forth start up.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.369
But I do respect your space.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.330
I hope I haven't put the family

18:01.413 --> 18:04.083
- in a bind.
- Well, the family is the other issue.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.168
Your grandparents promised
to build that crazy...

18:06.919 --> 18:08.462
border wall to some...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.339
Oh. Chinese.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.383
Now they're worrying
that the Chinese are gonna be upset

18:13.467 --> 18:16.595
and say... Oh. "You will pay."

18:18.055 --> 18:18.931
Huh.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.850
Anyway, I said,
"We're not selling Fakeblock,

18:21.934 --> 18:24.144
'cause, I promise you,
it'll make plenty of money."

18:24.645 --> 18:27.439
Well, you know, I'd... be careful
of promising even a little.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.984
You know, some people,
you give them an inch, and they take...

18:31.735 --> 18:32.778
A foot.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.448
They're threatening our feet?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.077
Is it a foot now?
They shortened it.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.704
Well, what I'm saying is,
finishing the software

18:42.788 --> 18:45.040
is definitely possible.
And I'm not saying I botched it,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.166
but...

18:46.250 --> 18:47.543
What if it's botched?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.920

I don't want to talk about it, okay?

18:56.301 --> 18:57.136
What?

18:57.511 --> 19:00.264
Why don't you go back downstairs
and get to work on that software floor?

19:02.182 --> 19:03.600
Shut the door on the way out.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.018
Thank you.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.522
Just no rush on the software,
but just... ASAP.

19:08.939 --> 19:09.940
Chop, chop.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.776
Well, not "chop, chop," not...
That's a bad choice of words.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.969
That's why I said you should fire him.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.929
That's what I'd do
if it were one of my kids.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.140
Did you want me to fire him for you?

19:43.223 --> 19:44.641
No. That's nice of you.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.768
I mean, it's not...
It's not nice. Sorry.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.730
It's quick.
Very, very quick of you to offer,

19:49.813 --> 19:52.441
but George Michael
and I are finally close again, and, uh,

19:52.524 --> 19:55.068
I didn't inherit your love
of firing family.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.405
- And certainly not him.
- I know it's not family,

19:58.488 --> 19:59.323
but maybe

19:59.406 --> 20:01.575
- you'll do a big layoff around Christmas.
- God.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.120
Are we already talking
about Christmas layoffs?

20:05.537 --> 20:07.539
Guys, building the wall's the only way.

20:07.623 --> 20:11.043
We took money from the Chinese investors.
I... I can't sell my son's company

20:11.126 --> 20:15.088
to make good on a loan, but I think
that I have come up with a... work-around

20:15.172 --> 20:16.882
- to pay them back.
- So sorry to interrupt.

20:16.965 --> 20:17.883
- Hi.
- They're ready.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.552
I finished writing your speech
about the wall. Question.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.887
Do you need an opening parable?

20:21.970 --> 20:24.097
It's hard to find one
where the wall builder isn't,

20:24.181 --> 20:26.308
you know, starved to death
by his own wall,

20:26.391 --> 20:28.018
or dies of loneliness by his own wall.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.229
Or, of course,
is crushed to death by his own wall.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.397
Yeah. We don't want
to blow the ending anyway.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.025
Ah. Then you'll hate the one
about the honeybee.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.319
<i>And while Michael didn't know</i>
<i>if his announcement</i>

20:37.402 --> 20:40.155
<i>would make it all the way
to China, it definitely made it</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:41.448
<i>as far as the model home.</i>

20:41.531 --> 20:44.785
- Could those be... TV cameras?
- There you are.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.371
Hey, I want to thank everybody
for coming out

20:47.454 --> 20:51.333
to the great Bluth Company
border wall project.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.668
<i>Gob quickly made a call</i>

20:52.751 --> 20:54.211
<i>- to his former compliance officer.</i>
<i>- Hello?</i>

20:54.753 --> 20:55.837
Nine rings?

20:56.546 --> 20:57.714
Are you at Sudden Valley?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.341
Yes, uh, I believe you were told,

20:59.758 --> 21:02.928
<i>although perhaps someone foolishly left
a message for you at work.</i>

21:03.011 --> 21:04.179
<i>It's a business event.</i>

21:04.263 --> 21:05.973
- Beautiful day.
- The Bluth Company.

21:06.056 --> 21:06.890
<i>On TV?</i>

21:07.224 --> 21:08.934
- Are you on TV?
<i>- A local channel</i>

21:09.017 --> 21:10.936
<i>is televising it, I believe.</i>

21:11.645 --> 21:13.230
<i>Yes, there they are.</i>

21:13.313 --> 21:14.940
- Okay.
<i>- Absolutely great day.</i>

21:15.023 --> 21:16.525
Walk to the camera, okay?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.653
- Walk to the camera quick, so I...
<i>- I don't feel comfortable...</i>

21:19.736 --> 21:22.322
I need you to comply
and walk over to the camera!

21:22.698 --> 21:25.242
Wow, this is perfect. Michael plans

21:25.409 --> 21:27.577
a little "work event" during the weekmid.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.621
Right? That's just... Look at me.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.373
- <i>I can't see you.</i>
- Comply!

21:31.456 --> 21:32.916
Look me in the eyes and tell me

21:33.000 --> 21:35.043
that Michael didn't want me
to know about this

21:35.127 --> 21:38.505
because I'm the president of Fakeblock.
It's why he planned it so early, isn't it?

21:38.588 --> 21:39.923
<i>Uh, Gob, really?</i>

21:40.007 --> 21:42.759
<i>In fairness,
it is a Thursday at twenty to four.</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:44.469
Exactly, and everyone knows

21:44.553 --> 21:46.888
the workday doesn't start
until nine to five.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.932
<i>Look,</i>
<i>I need to get back to him.</i>

21:49.016 --> 21:50.559
<i>Michael's going to announce the wall.</i>

21:50.642 --> 21:53.437
Did he sell Fakeblock to build it?
Does George Michael know?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.564
<i>No, I believe</i>
<i>he found a way around that.</i>

21:55.647 --> 21:56.898
Well, I'm gonna tell him.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.151
<i>It's a groundbreaking.</i>
<i>I wouldn't be concerned.</i>

21:59.234 --> 22:00.944
A... a groundbreaking?

22:01.820 --> 22:04.531
A groundbreaking?
Should... should... should...

22:04.614 --> 22:07.659
<i>Let history not judge us</i>
<i>for the ideology, but rather...</i>

22:07.743 --> 22:09.786
the quality of its workmanship,

22:09.870 --> 22:13.206
for we are just filling orders.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.130
You want to...
You... you...

22:20.213 --> 22:21.923
Should... should I? Should...?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.425
You want to see some...?

22:23.508 --> 22:25.260
You wanna see groundbreaking gay TV?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.970
Don't start without me.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.014
- George Michael!
<i>- Okay, but we've started.</i>

22:29.097 --> 22:32.142
<i>- We're in the middle of... Hello?</i>
<i>- In a modern world where there</i>

22:32.225 --> 22:33.602
are certainly more threats greater

22:33.685 --> 22:37.064
than a 34-year-old hard-working migrant
hoping

22:37.147 --> 22:38.982
to send money home to feed

22:39.066 --> 22:40.859
his wife and three young...

22:43.570 --> 22:44.780
future rapists.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.911
Of course,
I'm talking about the threat of cyber.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.412
And that is why the Bluth Company

22:52.496 --> 22:55.749
acquired a new partner
just for this project.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.793
Adhir. Thank you.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.753
- Wow!
- Look at that.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.214
Okay? Introducing...

23:02.756 --> 23:05.384
Fakeblock. We've purchased this company

23:05.467 --> 23:09.012
<i>solely in order to embed
its privacy technology...</i>

23:09.096 --> 23:12.182
- What the?!
<i>- ...into our state-of-the-art prototype</i>

23:12.265 --> 23:13.141
wall project.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.020
We meant to do this, folks,
so nobody was deceived.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.567
And that's it.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.404
<i>And so, as Michael went</i>

23:25.487 --> 23:29.574
<i>to ceremonially break ground
to prove that Fakeblock could build</i>

23:29.658 --> 23:30.909
<i>an indestructible wall...</i>

23:31.243 --> 23:32.369
To the wall!

23:33.078 --> 23:35.455
May it bring us all... together.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.791
<i>...Gob kind of made the opposite.</i>

23:44.506 --> 23:48.510
My name is Gob Bluth,
and as president of Fakeblock,

23:48.802 --> 23:50.554
I have an announcement!

23:50.846 --> 23:52.764
I'm building a wall!

23:54.057 --> 23:57.436
Come back for the unveiling
in two full weeks!

24:00.230 --> 24:03.275
- Wow, that was spectacular.
- Couldn't have gone better.

24:03.358 --> 24:06.278
It's great, Michael.
I mean, it placates the Chinese,

24:06.361 --> 24:09.281
and as long as cash comes in
from the software within the month...

24:09.364 --> 24:10.740
- Yeah.
- ...we'll be able to pay

24:10.824 --> 24:13.118
the lawyers who are working
on Buster's murder charges.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.162
Come in close.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.247
I think
I'm winning your mother back.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.332
I'm gonna stick it to her tonight.

24:19.499 --> 24:22.419
We couldn't be prouder, Michael.
And in his dreams.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.421
- Right.
- Hey. Did you see that?

24:24.504 --> 24:26.089
Did you see what I did?
Did you see that?

24:26.173 --> 24:27.924
Yeah, yeah.

24:30.093 --> 24:31.386
I had a shovel for you.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.681
No, it's okay. I wanted to come in hot,
make a show of it.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.601
God, did you see the look
on their faces?

24:38.518 --> 24:40.687
Just when you said two weeks
to the unveiling.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.646
Right?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.315
And when you turned
and went after them.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.568
George Michael's coming
after you, by the way.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.613
- What was that?
- Hi.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.281
Why would you bring my company
into this?

24:51.364 --> 24:53.909
- Yup. Listen.
- Now we have a contract to fulfill?

24:53.992 --> 24:57.787
I know that I told you you'd have time
to get the software all worked out,

24:57.871 --> 24:59.956
but it is looking like we're gonna need it
in a month.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.417
- A month?
- Yeah, I was hopingto stall for six,

25:02.501 --> 25:05.504
but your uncle announced an unveiling
in two weeks.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.548
The upside is, after this,
we're gonna be able to free up capital,

25:08.632 --> 25:09.633
get you some tech guys.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.718
I got some friends
in mapping I can talk to

25:11.801 --> 25:13.553
- when they come up for air.
- I can't do this.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.888
- You can't.
- Well...

25:14.971 --> 25:16.264
Tell them it's off. Go up there

25:16.348 --> 25:18.308
- and tell them it's off.
- That's the other thing.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.143
I mean, there is no more...

25:20.435 --> 25:22.896
"up there," um, and... and... and look, I...

25:22.979 --> 25:24.606
I <i>cannot </i> call it off.

25:24.689 --> 25:25.982
But I'm the one on the line.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.360
I'm the only one who needs
to lose feet over this...

25:28.443 --> 25:29.402
<i>sleep </i> over this.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.821
You just need to make the software.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.365
I should have told you, but,

25:34.032 --> 25:35.659
it just seemed like something

25:35.742 --> 25:38.286
that you might have
a knee-jerk overreaction to.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.331
I can tell you what
your grandmother would do.

25:41.414 --> 25:42.457
- Um...
- You're fired.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.876
She does go right there,
but obviously

25:44.960 --> 25:46.628
I don't think that <i>you </i> would go that far.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.088
You have more shares than me,

25:48.171 --> 25:50.215
- so you <i>could </i> fire me.
- I just did.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.265
Yup. This is how it ended
for the honeybee, as well.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.602
<i>And that's when Michael decided</i>

26:02.686 --> 26:05.605
<i>he deserved to use what was going to be...</i>

26:05.689 --> 26:06.773
<i>You're </i> fired.
