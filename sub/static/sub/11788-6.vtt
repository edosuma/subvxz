23:15.820 --> 23:17.481
CALDERELLO OFF THE SCHEDULE? I

23:17.490 --> 23:18.821
MOVED A RHINOPLASTY TO GET HER

23:18.830 --> 23:21.128
IN!

23:21.130 --> 23:22.688
Sean: I WANTED TO SIT ON IT.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.019
Christian: SIT ON IT? THE WOMAN

23:24.030 --> 23:25.691
HAS NO LIPS.

23:25.700 --> 23:26.724
Sean: I'M UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT

23:26.730 --> 23:28.561
LYING TO HER HUSBAND. IT WOULD

23:28.570 --> 23:30.765
BE LIKE ME LYING TO JULIA. OR

23:30.770 --> 23:32.032
LYING TO YOU.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.031
>> * LIES, LIES, LIES, YEAH *

23:34.040 --> 23:35.029
Christian: HE'S NOT YOUR

23:35.040 --> 23:37.941
PATIENT. SHE IS. WE'RE SIMPLY

23:37.950 --> 23:39.144
PROTECTING HER PRIVACY.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.139
Sean: WE'RE PROTECTING HER

23:40.150 --> 23:41.549
PRIVACY OR KEEPING HER SECRETS?

23:41.550 --> 23:42.676
Christian: YOU'RE SUCH A GODDAMN

23:42.680 --> 23:45.979
MORALIST. WE LIE, SEAN. WE KEEP

23:45.990 --> 23:47.514
SECRETS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE

23:47.520 --> 23:49.181
PEOPLE THAT WE LOVE. HUSBANDS,

23:49.190 --> 23:51.750
WIVES, CHILDREN, FRIENDS, EVEN

23:51.760 --> 23:54.923
STRANGERS. SHIT, IF ANNE FRANK

23:54.930 --> 23:56.522
HAD BEEN HIDING IN YOUR A'ITIC,

23:56.530 --> 23:57.519
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT PAST THE

23:57.530 --> 24:01.762
WORDS "DEAR DIARY." I'M PU'ITING

24:01.770 --> 24:04.830
PUSSY LIPS BACK ON THE SCHEDULE.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.865

Policeman: YOU WANNA TELL US

25:06.000 --> 25:07.763
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.805
Matt: HEY. THANKS FOR COMING.

25:16.810 --> 25:17.845
Christian: DON'T WORRY, OFFICER.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.249
THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.138
Officer: IT BE'ITER NOT. NEXT

25:21.150 --> 25:22.139
TIME HE'LL BE CHARGED AS AN

25:26.620 --> 25:31.057
Matt, laughing: HOLY SHIT. MAN,

25:31.060 --> 25:32.152
THAT WAS LIKE BEING ABDUCT ED BY

25:36.300 --> 25:37.892
IT'S LIKE TO BE ANALLY PROBED BY

25:37.900 --> 25:39.891
SOME LIFER WHO WANTS TO MAKE YOU

25:39.900 --> 25:44.303
HIS BITCH!

25:44.310 --> 25:45.299
Matt: COME ON, WHAT--WHAT ARE

25:45.310 --> 25:46.607
THEY GONNA DO, ARREST EVERY KID

25:46.610 --> 25:48.908
WHO JACKS OFF?

25:48.910 --> 25:49.899
Christian: YOUR MOMMY DIDN'T

25:49.910 --> 25:51.172
JUST CATCH YOU IN THE BATHROOM,

25:51.180 --> 25:53.774
MA'IT. YOU WERE BEATING OFF IN

25:53.780 --> 25:55.714
PUBLIC! ONCE YOU ARE BRANDED A

25:55.720 --> 25:57.984
SEX OFFENDER, IT STAYS WITH YOU.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.617
Matt: I'M SCREWING UP MY FUTURE.

25:59.620 --> 26:03.920
I GOT IT. BUT IT WASN'T ALL MY

26:03.930 --> 26:04.919
FAULT.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.181
Christian: OH, RIGHT. LIKE

26:06.190 --> 26:08.727
SOMEONE MADE YOU WHACK OFF?!

26:08.730 --> 26:10.925
Matt: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER. SHE

26:10.930 --> 26:12.795
IS UNBELIEVABLY HOT.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.789
Christian: YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL

26:13.800 --> 26:14.937
FOR SOME HOT PIECE OF TEENAGE

26:14.940 --> 26:15.929
ASS?

26:15.940 --> 26:17.168
Matt: SHE'S NOT A TEENAGE PIECE

26:17.170 --> 26:21.300
OF ASS. SHE'S YOUR AGE, OK?

26:21.310 --> 26:23.778
SHE'S THE LIFE COACH MOM HIRED

26:23.780 --> 26:25.179
TO GET MY GRADES UP.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.205
Christian: YOUR GRADES, ASSHOLE,

26:27.210 --> 26:30.270
NOT YOUR DICK! NOW, YOU STAY

26:30.280 --> 26:31.281
AWAY FROM HER!

26:31.290 --> 26:32.746
Matt: OH, YEAH, RIGHT, LIKE YOU

26:32.750 --> 26:35.218
DON'T THINK OLDER WOMEN ARE HOT?

26:35.220 --> 26:36.357
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU SLEPT WITH MY

26:36.360 --> 26:41.696
GRANDMOTHER? MAN, I DON'T EVEN

26:41.700 --> 26:43.292
RECOGNIZE YOU. WHERE'S THE GUY

26:43.300 --> 26:44.961
WHO GOT ME DRUNK WHEN I WAS 13?

26:44.970 --> 26:45.959
WHERE'S THE GUY WHO TOOK ME TO

26:45.970 --> 26:47.665
THAT STRIP CLUB? WHERE'S THE GUY

26:47.670 --> 26:50.730
WHO BOUGHT ME MY FIRST RUBBER?

26:50.740 --> 26:56.701
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

26:56.710 --> 26:57.699
Christian: YOU ARE NEVER TO SEE

26:57.710 --> 27:02.340
HER AGAIN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

27:02.350 --> 27:03.374
Matt: HERE'S A LITTLE UPDATE FOR

27:03.380 --> 27:05.917
YOU, CHRISTIAN. I ALREADY HAVE A

27:05.920 --> 27:07.911
FATHER, AND I DON'T NEED ANOTHER

27:07.920 --> 27:09.148
ONE.

27:19.700 --> 27:20.689
Ava: I JUST THINK IT'S LOVELY

27:20.700 --> 27:21.689
YOU'RE SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF

27:21.700 --> 27:22.962
HIS LIFE. GROWING UP'S SO

27:22.970 --> 27:25.768
COMPLICATED NOW. WE COULD ALL

27:25.770 --> 27:30.036
USE A PROTECTIVE EYE.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.871
Christian: THANKS. AND I'M HIS

27:31.880 --> 27:34.417
GODFATH ER.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.877
Ava: HIS GODFATHER. REALLY?

27:36.880 --> 27:37.881
Christian: I WENT TO COLLEGE

27:37.890 --> 27:40.085
WITH HIS PARENTS. WE'RE ALL

27:40.090 --> 27:43.082
PRETTY CLOSE, AND I'M IN

27:43.090 --> 27:45.354
BUSINESS WITH HIS FATHER. TROY

27:45.360 --> 27:49.148
McNAMARA.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.367
Ava: SO, THAT WAS, WHAT, 20

27:51.370 --> 27:52.428
YEARS AGO?

27:52.430 --> 27:57.231
Christian: 17.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.903
Ava: WELL, HE'S VERY LUCKY THAT

28:00.910 --> 28:04.175
YOU'RE WATCHING OUT OVER HIM.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.977
UH, LOOK, DR. TROY, YOU DO

28:05.980 --> 28:07.106
UNDERSTAND THAT MY WORK WITH

28:07.110 --> 28:08.111
MA'IT IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.109
IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN

28:09.120 --> 28:10.109
PARTICULAR--

28:10.120 --> 28:11.109
Christian: HE'S IN LOVE WITH

28:11.120 --> 28:13.850
YOU.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.112
Ava: I ENCOURAGE TRANSFERENCE.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.109
IT'S INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING

28:17.120 --> 28:18.121
ABOUT CHANGE.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.119
Christian: HE WAS CAUGHT

28:19.130 --> 28:20.188
MASTURBATING OUTSIDE YOUR

28:20.190 --> 28:22.329
WINDOW. IS THAT PART OF

28:22.330 --> 28:23.490
TRANSFERENCE, TOO?

28:23.500 --> 28:27.869
[AVA LAUGHS]

28:27.870 --> 28:31.533
Ava: HE'S YOUNG AND VERY SWEET.

28:31.540 --> 28:32.529
Christian: YOU THINK WHAT HE'S

28:32.540 --> 28:35.839
DOING IS SWEET? LOOK, YOU'RE A

28:35.840 --> 28:37.398
BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. YOU

28:37.410 --> 28:39.901
HAVE A CERTAIN ALLURE TO A KID

28:39.910 --> 28:41.275
WHO'S STILL AT AN IMPRESSIONABLE

28:41.280 --> 28:43.419
AGE. YOU MAY BE UNDERESTIMATING

28:43.420 --> 28:46.184
YOUR EFFECT ON HIM.

28:46.190 --> 28:48.317
Ava: HE'S IMMATURE. I'LL TALK

28:48.320 --> 28:49.787
TO HIM.

28:49.790 --> 28:55.899
Christian: GOOD. [EXHALES] AHEM.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.026
AND IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE YOU

28:57.030 --> 28:59.419
COULD RECOMMEND FOR HIM TO SEE.

28:59.430 --> 29:00.419
Ava: WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

29:00.430 --> 29:01.431
Christian: WELL, YOU'RE NOT

29:01.440 --> 29:02.429
GONNA WORK WITH HIM AI-TER WHAT

29:02.440 --> 29:03.429
I TOLD YOU.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.566
Ava: DR. TROY, I'M TRYING TO

29:04.570 --> 29:06.561
RID HIM OF HIS SHAME, ENCOURAGE

29:06.570 --> 29:07.559
HIM TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIS

29:07.570 --> 29:09.128
FEELINGS, INCLUDING HIS SEXUAL

29:09.140 --> 29:12.200
IMPULSES. HIS ATTRACTION TO ME

29:12.210 --> 29:16.818
IS NORMAL...AS MINE IS TO HIM...

29:16.820 --> 29:20.312
AND MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS. HE

29:20.320 --> 29:22.049
MAKES ME FEEL 10 YEARS YOUNGER.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.049
Christian: YOU WANNA FEEL

29:23.060 --> 29:24.584
YOUNGER, TRY BOTOX, NOT A

29:24.590 --> 29:25.921
17-YEAR-OLD KID.

29:25.930 --> 29:26.919
Ava: I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO

29:26.930 --> 29:27.919
PU RITANICAL.

29:27.930 --> 29:28.919
Christian: I'M A GODDAMN

29:28.930 --> 29:30.591
PILGRIM! HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH

29:30.600 --> 29:31.589
HIM?

29:31.600 --> 29:32.589
Ava: I TOLD YOU THAT'S

29:32.600 --> 29:34.431
CONFIDENTIAL. YOU'LL HAVE TO

29:34.440 --> 29:35.464
FIND SOME OTHER FANTASY TO HELP

29:35.470 --> 29:36.459
YOU GET IT UP.

29:36.470 --> 29:37.459
Christian: I'LL HAVE YOU

29:37.470 --> 29:38.937
ARRESTED FOR STATUTORY RAPE.

29:38.940 --> 29:39.929
Ava: HE'S 17. IN FLORIDA,

29:39.940 --> 29:40.929
THAT'S A CONSENTING ADULT.

29:40.940 --> 29:41.929
Christian: YOU CERTAINLY KNOW

29:41.940 --> 29:42.929
YOUR RAPE LAW.

29:42.940 --> 29:43.941
Ava: WELL, AS SOMEONE WHO,

29:43.950 --> 29:44.939
ACCORDING TO MATT, HAS HAD THEIR

29:44.950 --> 29:46.577
SHARE OF TEENAGE GIRLS, YOU'RE

29:46.580 --> 29:52.587
STUPID IF YOU DON'T.

29:52.590 --> 29:57.186
Christian: WELL...I'M SURE JULIA

29:57.190 --> 29:58.953
WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR

29:58.960 --> 30:00.222
ABOUT WHAT PARTS OF LIFE YOU'RE

30:00.230 --> 30:01.492
COACHING HER SON IN.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.024
Ava: AND I'M SURE SEAN WILL BE

30:03.030 --> 30:04.361
VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHO

30:04.370 --> 30:10.297
MA'IT'S REAL FATHER IS.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.301
Christian: I DON'T KNOW WHAT

30:11.310 --> 30:13.266
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.500
Ava: DON'T YOU?

30:15.510 --> 30:16.534
Christian: JULIA WOULD NEVER--

30:16.540 --> 30:18.906
Ava: SHE DIDN'T NEED TO. THE

30:18.910 --> 30:21.310
RESEMBLANCE IS QUITE OBVIOUS.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.514
OF COURSE, WE RARELY BELIEVE

30:22.520 --> 30:24.488
WHAT WE SEE WHEN WE DON'T WANNA

30:24.490 --> 30:26.412
SEE IT.

30:40.670 --> 30:42.558
Sean: IT'S STILL VERY EARLY. YOU

30:42.570 --> 30:44.037
SHOULD CALL THE OFFICE IF YOU

30:44.040 --> 30:45.530
NOTICE ANY ADDITIONAL DRAINAGE

30:45.540 --> 30:50.409
FROM THE INCISION SITE. BUT

30:50.410 --> 30:53.140
OTHER THAN THAT, WE'RE RIGHT ON

30:53.150 --> 30:55.072
COURSE.

31:04.560 --> 31:10.021
Mrs. Broderick: WOW. THIS WOULD

31:10.030 --> 31:11.964
NOT MAKE A VERY GOOD "AFTER"

31:11.970 --> 31:13.562
PICTURE. LOOKS LIKE I'VE BEEN IN

31:13.570 --> 31:15.959
A CAR ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING.

31:15.970 --> 31:17.062
Sean: THE BRUISING WILL GO AWAY

31:17.070 --> 31:19.209
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND MINOR

31:19.210 --> 31:20.268
PUCKERING AT THE INCISION IS

31:20.270 --> 31:21.271
NOT UNCOMMON.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.305
Mrs. Broderick: MMM. [CHUCKLES]

31:23.310 --> 31:25.005
THERE WERE NO PICTURES LIKE THIS

31:25.010 --> 31:27.069
IN THE BROCHURES YOU GAVE ME.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.069
Sean: WELL, IF IT'S STILL THERE

31:28.080 --> 31:29.570
IN A FEW WEEKS, WE'LL TAKE CARE

31:29.580 --> 31:30.615
OF IT USING A LOCAL IN THE

31:30.620 --> 31:33.714
OFFICE.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.709
Mrs. Broderick: BUT YOU DIDN'T

31:34.720 --> 31:35.709
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A SECOND

31:35.720 --> 31:36.687
SURGERY.

31:36.690 --> 31:37.714
Sean: IF IT'S STILL THERE,

31:37.720 --> 31:38.721
WHICH I'M SURE IT WON'T BE.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.719
Mrs. Broderick: WHAT HAPPENED TO

31:39.730 --> 31:41.322
"LIPOSUCT ION IS THE MOST COMMON

31:41.330 --> 31:42.319
PROCEDURE"?

31:42.330 --> 31:43.319
Sean: IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR

31:43.330 --> 31:44.319
PATIENTS TO COME IN FOR A

31:44.330 --> 31:45.968
TOUCH-UP. THIS ISN'T LIKE THOSE

31:45.970 --> 31:47.096
TV SHOWS WHERE EVERYTHING'S

31:47.100 --> 31:48.431
PERFECT Al-TER SURGERY: NO

31:48.440 --> 31:49.589
BRUISING, NO NEED FOR A PERIOD

31:49.600 --> 31:50.589
OF CONVALESCENCE.

31:50.600 --> 31:51.601
Mrs. Broderick: YOU SHOULD'VE

31:51.610 --> 31:53.601
WARNED ME. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A

31:53.610 --> 31:57.068
JOB INTERVIEW IN 10 DAYS. I

31:57.080 --> 31:58.069
CAN'T AFFORD TO GO THROUGH THIS

31:58.080 --> 31:59.604
AGAIN .

31:59.610 --> 32:01.077
Sean: GIVE IT TIME. EVERYONE

32:01.080 --> 32:02.069
HEALS AT THEIR OWN--

32:02.080 --> 32:03.069
Mrs. Broderick: TIME IS WHAT I

32:03.080 --> 32:07.483
DON'T HAVE, DOCTOR. I THOUGHT

32:07.490 --> 32:11.688
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT. THIS IS IT.

32:11.690 --> 32:22.464
THIS IS MY SHOT. OHH...GOD. LOOK

32:22.470 --> 32:27.635
AT ME. HOW MANY MORE CHANCES

32:27.640 --> 32:29.437
DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA GET?

32:33.780 --> 32:37.546
>> * THE THING THAT MAKES ME,

32:37.550 --> 32:43.159
WHAT THE GUYS GO CRAZY FOR,

32:43.160 --> 32:45.219
THEY LOSE THEIR MINDS,

32:45.230 --> 32:47.221
THE WAY I WIND,

32:47.230 --> 32:48.128
I THINK IT'S TIME... *

32:48.130 --> 32:49.722
Sean: THERE'S NO WINNER.

32:49.730 --> 32:50.651
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE YOURSELF

32:50.660 --> 32:51.524
A HEART ATTACK.

32:51.530 --> 32:54.795
Christian: PROMISE?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.495
I HATE THIS PLACE.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.660
Sean: COME ON, WE'RE LUCKY.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.399
STATE-OF-THE-ART, 5 MINUTES FROM

32:59.410 --> 33:00.263
THE OFFICE.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.271
Christian: LOOK AROUND.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.236
