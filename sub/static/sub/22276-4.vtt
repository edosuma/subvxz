AARON MAHNKE: On the evening
of February 5, 1921...

00:16.642 --> 00:18.060
Thomas Bradford,

00:18.102 --> 00:19.979
an engineer and psychic,

00:20.020 --> 00:23.524
completed a book about the afterlife.

00:23.566 --> 00:25.860
Then he tested it.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.992
Weeks before, Bradford
had placed an advertisement

00:33.033 --> 00:34.785
in a Detroit newspaper.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.370
He was seeking someone

00:36.412 --> 00:38.789
interested in spiritualistic science.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.418
Ruth Duran, a 40-year-old woman

00:42.460 --> 00:44.879
from one of Detroit's oldest families,

00:44.920 --> 00:47.214
answered Bradford's ad.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.217
She did it out of simple curiosity.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.511
The plan was as straightforward

00:52.553 --> 00:54.180
as it was unsettling.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.140
He would attempt to speak to Ruth

00:56.182 --> 00:57.475
from the other side.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.602
[TYPING]

01:04.565 --> 01:07.193
After Ruth left for the final time,

01:07.234 --> 01:09.779
Thomas locked his boarding house door...

01:12.198 --> 01:13.532
and sealed the room.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.121
Then he blew out the pilot light

01:19.163 --> 01:21.665
and turned on the gas...

01:21.707 --> 01:23.375
[GAS HISSING]

01:23.417 --> 01:27.087
and began what he called
"The Great Adventure."

01:34.637 --> 01:36.639
After his body was discovered,

01:36.680 --> 01:38.808
Ruth told a reporter,

01:38.849 --> 01:42.061
"I believe he will make
his presence known to me."

01:42.102 --> 01:46.565
A week later, she said he spoke.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.610
"I have not traveled
far," the voice said.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.780
"One feels full of
rapture and happiness."

01:54.156 --> 01:56.408
What did Ruth actually hear?

01:56.450 --> 01:58.911
Well, we'll never know for sure.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.956
She took that secret to her own grave.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.352
In 1843, life changed forever

02:23.394 --> 02:25.479
for the Reverend Eliakim Phelps.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.697
With the passing of his wife Elizabeth,

02:34.738 --> 02:37.867
he was overwhelmed by crushing sadness,

02:37.908 --> 02:39.368
and it challenged everything

02:39.410 --> 02:41.120
Phelps had been taught to believe.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.416
As a man of God,

02:45.457 --> 02:47.543
the boundaries between
this world and the next

02:47.585 --> 02:48.752
were clearly defined.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.632
For him, the door between life and death

02:53.674 --> 02:55.301
was forever shut.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.641
But Phelps lived in a time

03:02.683 --> 03:05.561
when people were beginning to experiment

03:05.603 --> 03:10.149
with ways to communicate
with the other side

03:10.190 --> 03:13.652
by repurposing the secrets
of ancient mysticism...

03:16.071 --> 03:17.823
and through séances.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.868
It was even rumored

03:20.910 --> 03:22.953
that Mary Lincoln had held a séance

03:22.995 --> 03:25.581
in the White House for her deceased son.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.294
What began with a handful of beliefs

03:30.336 --> 03:32.379
turned into a movement.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.465
It was called Spiritualism,

03:34.506 --> 03:36.550
the belief that you
didn't have to be dead

03:36.592 --> 03:39.470
to communicate with the dead.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.389
The afterlife, the other world,

03:42.431 --> 03:45.184
whatever we want to call
it, it's right there.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.062
We just need to reach beyond the veil.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.315
In spite of himself,

03:51.357 --> 03:53.859
the Reverend Phelps
was drawn to the promise

03:53.901 --> 03:56.070
the Spiritualist Movement offered.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.032
He tried to move on.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.743
Two years after Elizabeth's passing,

04:02.785 --> 04:04.495
he married Sarah Nicholson,

04:04.536 --> 04:08.457
a much younger woman,
recently widowed herself.

04:08.499 --> 04:13.003
Phelps became stepfather
to Sarah's children,

04:13.045 --> 04:16.005
and the new Phelps family
moved into a large home

04:16.048 --> 04:18.257
in Stratford, Connecticut.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.469
[THUNDER]

04:20.511 --> 04:23.222
Yet Phelps couldn't let go.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.475
He still longed for
his beloved Elizabeth...

04:26.517 --> 04:30.896
for one final touch, one final moment,

04:30.938 --> 04:34.191
for a chance to open that door.

04:37.152 --> 04:40.280
It's a desire we can all relate to.

04:40.322 --> 04:44.034
But just because we want
to doesn't mean we should.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.748
Some doors, you see,
are closed for a reason.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.802
For the first two
years in their new home,

05:01.844 --> 05:05.097
life was uneventful for
the new Phelps family.

05:05.139 --> 05:08.017
But on March 10 of 1850,

05:08.058 --> 05:11.061
as they return home from
the morning church service,

05:11.103 --> 05:13.105
all of that changed.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.012

Where's Henry?

07:22.359 --> 07:23.652
Elizabeth?

07:28.657 --> 07:29.992
Take Henry out.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.410
Who would do this?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.663
I do not know,

07:34.705 --> 07:36.915
and I do not care.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.669
No one was hurt.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.880
No possessions were taken.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.591
There appears to be no further threat.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.804
It was... It was...

07:52.097 --> 07:54.183
It's just a bluff.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.227
Does everyone understand?
It's just a bluff.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.104
All right.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.691
Let's...

08:02.733 --> 08:05.235
Let's return our house to order,

08:05.277 --> 08:06.528
have our lunch.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.657
We'll go to church
for afternoon service.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.700

08:36.933 --> 08:39.144
Give these to Pastor Richards.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.190
on performing this afternoon's service.

The Reverend Phelps took responsibility

12:38.758 --> 12:41.094
for the figures and the knocking.

12:41.136 --> 12:45.474
He wondered if he'd
unknowingly invited them in.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.487
When Dr. Isaac Bristol
had visited Reverend Phelps

12:58.528 --> 13:01.656
a week before the
first incident occurred,

13:01.698 --> 13:04.493
the two men may have
heard of Spiritualism,

13:04.534 --> 13:07.954
perhaps even read newspaper
accounts of a séance.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.748
But neither would have known anyone

13:09.789 --> 13:12.250
who'd participated in such a ceremony.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.676
I visited Austin while I was in Andover.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.011
He's been promoted

13:23.053 --> 13:24.804
to Professor of Scared Rhetorics

13:24.846 --> 13:26.473
at the seminary.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.893
Oh, I'm so proud of my son Austin,

13:29.935 --> 13:32.020
but he is ashamed of his father

13:32.062 --> 13:35.899
for marrying someone closer
to his own age than mine.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.026
He despises me for marrying Sarah,

13:38.068 --> 13:40.237
as does her son Henry.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.447
I fear the only person
that can reach him

13:42.489 --> 13:44.783
- is his own father.
- Oh.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.495
Difficult to reach him
six feet under ground.

13:48.537 --> 13:52.958
I have read accounts of
scientific discoveries

13:52.999 --> 13:57.504
regarding the use of mesmerism
as a bridge of communication

13:57.546 --> 13:59.548
to those who have passed on before us.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.260
I have to confess to you

14:03.301 --> 14:07.097
that I've actually thought
of attending a séance,

14:07.138 --> 14:08.682
I believe it is called.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.188
The chance to communicate
with his departed wife,

14:15.230 --> 14:16.856
cross through the door

14:16.898 --> 14:19.609
into the world that
Elizabeth now inhabited.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.904
These were the desires
that Phelps shared

14:22.946 --> 14:25.073
with a growing number of believers.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.667
Séances were becoming
ever more popular.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.420
And in an era when the laws of nature

14:38.461 --> 14:40.422
were supplanting the laws of God,

14:40.463 --> 14:44.092
Spiritualists were convinced
that newly discovered forces,

14:44.134 --> 14:46.261
still not fully understood,

14:46.303 --> 14:49.264
governed the interaction
with the afterworld.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.059
The ability to channel a force

14:53.101 --> 14:55.854
that could reach from this life to next

14:55.895 --> 14:58.648
found its origins 70 years earlier

14:58.690 --> 15:00.984
in the work of Franz Mesmer.

15:03.111 --> 15:07.073
Franz Mesmer, A German
physician in the late 1700s,

15:07.115 --> 15:09.534
believed he'd identified the vital force

15:09.576 --> 15:11.620
that flowed through all living beings.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.750
He called this force animal magnetism.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.336
Mesmer believed

15:19.377 --> 15:22.172
that when this force
could not flow freely,

15:22.213 --> 15:23.840
people became ill.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.219
He claimed he could cure his patients

15:28.261 --> 15:30.180
by removing this blockage.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.517
He would send the patient into a trance

15:34.559 --> 15:39.272
by directing his own magnetic
energy into their body.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.650
People were said to be "mesmerized,"

15:41.691 --> 15:43.610
a technique that would later become

15:43.652 --> 15:45.528
the basis for hypnosis.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.160
His practice became so popular

15:52.202 --> 15:54.621
that in order to treat
many people at once,

15:54.663 --> 15:56.414
he devised a device

15:56.456 --> 15:57.999
that connected patients to one another

15:58.041 --> 16:00.001
by means of metal rods

16:00.043 --> 16:03.505
so that magnetic energy could
be conducted between them.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.258
Mesmer himself never claimed

16:07.300 --> 16:10.345
to be able to communicate
with the spirits of the dead,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.847
but the séance evolved from his belief

16:12.889 --> 16:16.267
that these unseen forces
could be harnessed.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.354
The passing of energy

16:19.396 --> 16:21.356
from one person to the other.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.442
The power of the trance state.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.905
These were the aspects

16:28.947 --> 16:30.907
of Mesmer's scientific experiments

16:30.949 --> 16:33.243
that the Spiritualist
Movement would rely on

16:33.284 --> 16:36.121
to open the door to the spiritual world.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.841
Eliakim, you're a leader in this town,

16:47.882 --> 16:50.969
looked up upon, a Christian minister.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.470
When the Lord summons,

16:52.512 --> 16:53.972
our souls are called home to heaven

16:54.013 --> 16:55.682
or banished to hell.

16:55.724 --> 17:00.478
There are no ghosts of those
who once lived amongst us.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.564
The only spirits that
cross from death to life

17:02.605 --> 17:05.316
are demons offering
nothing but temptation

17:05.358 --> 17:08.194
through doors which should
remain closed and locked.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.989
And I would be willing to open that door

17:11.030 --> 17:14.617
and to look inside that room, Isaac,

17:14.659 --> 17:18.329
to see Elizabeth one last time.

17:18.371 --> 17:22.040
You risk scandal and
loss of your position.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.335
Your congregation would disown you.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.006

17:31.593 --> 17:34.512
Wouldn't everyone in my
congregation understand?

17:39.851 --> 17:43.855
Science is close to proving definitively

17:43.897 --> 17:45.482
the designs of God.

17:45.523 --> 17:51.029
Science will prove God.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.781
They are one in the same.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.742
Eli...

17:57.577 --> 18:02.999
these liberal Christian theologies

18:03.041 --> 18:04.876
that are bouncing around New York City

18:04.918 --> 18:09.798
will never be accepted in
a town founded by Puritans.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.343
Through the revelations
of the orbits of planets,

18:13.384 --> 18:17.096
astronomy is proving the design of God.

18:17.138 --> 18:21.017
Spiritualism may provide its own answers

18:21.059 --> 18:23.436
and unlock the door
into and out of heaven

18:23.478 --> 18:26.731
as God intended, as
science is just now finding.

18:28.191 --> 18:32.695
We look through glass darkly, Isaac...

18:32.737 --> 18:34.030
for now.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.412
How does it work?

18:41.454 --> 18:44.415
A séance? Do you know?

18:47.085 --> 18:49.546
Only the accounts that I've read.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.512
In 1848, something odd was happening

18:57.554 --> 18:59.973
at the home of John and Margaret Fox

19:00.014 --> 19:01.516
in upstate New York.

That's when their
daughters Kate and Margaret

19:09.357 --> 19:11.901
first made contact with the dead.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.824
They said it was the
spirit of Charles Rosna,

19:17.866 --> 19:20.869
a peddler who'd been
murdered five years earlier

19:20.910 --> 19:23.371
and who'd been buried in their basement.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.542
They spoke with this unseen entity

19:27.584 --> 19:29.502
through a series of clicks and knocks.

that the girls had a talent

19:46.019 --> 19:48.479
for attracting the spirits of the dead.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.570
Word spread quickly

19:55.612 --> 19:57.655
about what Kate and
Margaret Fox could do.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.035
The sisters began conducting séances

20:02.076 --> 20:05.246
in which they would translate
these mysterious sounds

20:05.288 --> 20:08.166
for anyone eager to hear
from a lost loved one.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.378
It was a chance to say hello
again or a final goodbye.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.131
And it was understandably popular.

20:18.384 --> 20:23.389
This hunger for communication
with the dead was so strong

20:23.431 --> 20:25.558
that within a few years,

20:25.600 --> 20:27.393
even those not normally given

20:27.435 --> 20:29.979
to believing in the spirit world

20:30.021 --> 20:33.107
were open to accepting its existence.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.729
We need to join hands.

21:28.413 --> 21:34.585
My first wife Elizabeth,
who died in 1843.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.258
Elizabeth Phelps...

21:42.218 --> 21:44.262
I need a sign from you.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.772
Elizabeth...

21:57.608 --> 22:00.236
I need a sign that you're okay.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.198
Elizabeth.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.047
Elizabeth, are you with us?

22:21.924 --> 22:24.010

23:10.473 --> 23:11.641
Of course.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.402
Reverend Phelps' longing
for his first wife

23:23.444 --> 23:25.947
pushed him to question
what he longed believed.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.242
And half a century later,

23:29.283 --> 23:31.869
the pull of Spiritualism
would force another man

23:31.911 --> 23:33.913
to question his own beliefs.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.126
Harry Houdini was the 20th century's

23:38.167 --> 23:40.670
most famous magician
and stunt performer...

23:40.711 --> 23:44.715
or, as he'd refer to
himself, mystical entertainer.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.425
[APPLAUSE]

23:46.467 --> 23:48.386
But one of his most popular roles

23:48.427 --> 23:50.721
was as a skeptic of Spiritualism.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.227
It was part of his act,
but it was an attitude

23:56.269 --> 23:58.855
that had sprung from
a personal experience.

24:00.815 --> 24:06.070
Houdini had lost his
mother Cecelia in 1913.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.072
He'd been utterly devoted to her,

24:08.114 --> 24:10.241
and he was so devastated when she passed

24:10.283 --> 24:12.952
that he gave up performing.

24:12.994 --> 24:15.288
Spiritualist friends urged him

24:15.329 --> 24:17.081
to rethink his skepticism,

24:17.123 --> 24:20.877
inviting him to reconnect
with her in a séance.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.048
The medium began to write out a message

24:26.090 --> 24:28.384
from the other side.

24:28.426 --> 24:32.680
But Houdini instantly
knew it was a cruel fraud.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.932
The message was in English.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.434
His mother spoke only

24:36.475 --> 24:38.603
a mixture of Hungarian and German.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.314
Houdini was outraged

24:41.355 --> 24:43.482
that they had tried
to exploit his grief.

24:43.524 --> 24:46.694
He made it his mission
to expose spiritualists

24:46.736 --> 24:50.323
as frauds, phonies, and bunk artists,

24:50.364 --> 24:52.825
skewering the Spiritualist masquerade

24:52.867 --> 24:54.118
in his stage shows.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.499
After his own death in 1926,

25:00.541 --> 25:03.211
Houdini's widow Bess conducted a séance

25:03.252 --> 25:04.837
every Halloween.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.423
MAN (ON RADIO): Houdini, are you here?

Are you here, Houdini?

The world is listening.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.097
And Bessie is here, your Bessie,

25:15.139 --> 25:18.017
pleading in her heart
for a prearranged sign.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.518
Speak, Harry!

25:19.560 --> 25:21.479
We are watching and waiting, Harry.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.272

25:23.314 --> 25:26.234
every year for ten years.

25:26.275 --> 25:30.488
MAN: Mrs. Houdini, the ten years are up.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.616
Have you reached a decision?

25:33.658 --> 25:38.079
BESS HOUDINI: Yes. My last hope is God.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.872
I do not believe

25:39.914 --> 25:44.335
that Houdini can come
back to me or to anyone.

25:44.377 --> 25:48.172
It is now my personal
and positive belief

25:48.214 --> 25:53.469
that spirit communication
in any form is impossible.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.349
MAHNKE: But one of Houdini's friends

25:58.391 --> 26:00.851
refused to give up on the spirit world.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.605
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
creator of Sherlock Holmes,

26:04.647 --> 26:06.482
was an ardent believer.

26:06.524 --> 26:10.194
I suppose I've sat with more mediums,

26:10.236 --> 26:14.240
good and bad and indifferent,

26:14.282 --> 26:18.077
than perhaps any living being.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.746
Doyle, a physician by training,

26:20.788 --> 26:22.415
had read about the Fox Sisters

26:22.456 --> 26:24.000
and was convinced

26:24.041 --> 26:26.502
that communication with
the dead was possible.

26:26.544 --> 26:30.381
In the summer of 1919,
Doyle visited a psychic

26:30.423 --> 26:32.758
and posed for a series of portraits.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.555
As he watched the first
photograph develop,

26:37.596 --> 26:39.307
he was amazed to see

26:39.348 --> 26:42.768
there was also someone
else in the picture.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.730
Doyle recognized the ghost of his son,

26:45.771 --> 26:49.984
who died from wounds
suffered in World War I.

26:50.026 --> 26:53.779
Doyle remained a staunch
defender of Spiritualism

26:53.821 --> 26:55.364
his entire life.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.575
I'm not talking about what I believe.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.368
I'm not talking about what I think.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.121
I'm talking about what I know.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.040
There's an enormous
difference, believe me,

27:04.081 --> 27:07.084
between believing a
thing and knowing a thing.

27:15.468 --> 27:16.844
Leviticus the 19th chapter...

27:16.886 --> 27:18.471
Phelps wasn't certain

27:18.512 --> 27:20.639
that the disturbances
from a month earlier

27:20.681 --> 27:22.558
were caused by spirits,

27:22.600 --> 27:24.977
but still he couldn't shake the feeling

27:25.019 --> 27:27.605
that they were somehow
connected to the séance

27:27.646 --> 27:30.608
he'd held with his friend Isaac Bristol.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.361

27:42.495 --> 27:46.290

in his home, however,

27:48.501 --> 27:50.753
daring him to ignore their presence.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.228
on the hauntings at the Phelps' house,

29:31.270 --> 29:33.647
how you are haunted by Goody Basset,

29:33.689 --> 29:36.317
a witch hung in the 1620s.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.652
It is dishonorable and scandalous

29:38.694 --> 29:40.237
to your reputation as a man of God

29:40.279 --> 29:42.698
and the harm that you are
committing to our family name.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.117
The faculty at the
seminary are asking me about

29:45.159 --> 29:48.537
why parishioners are beginning
to leave my father's church.

If I communicated with your mother,

the séance opened the door

30:22.738 --> 30:23.989

30:24.031 --> 30:26.492
There are no spirits or demons.

Saul told the Witch of Endor

35:25.791 --> 35:29.211
The fear of the witch was
deep rooted in New England.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.679
In the 17th century,
hundreds of young women

35:38.720 --> 35:40.430
were accused of witchcraft...

35:42.683 --> 35:44.560
then consorting with the devil.

35:46.812 --> 35:50.148
Goody Bassett of Stratford,
Connecticut, was one of them.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.238
She was strong willed and outspoken,

35:56.280 --> 35:59.283
not shy about criticizing the elders.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.411
A woman so brazen

36:02.452 --> 36:04.788
must be capable of sorcery.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.004
Goody and her husband
had moved to Stratford

36:12.045 --> 36:13.380
a few years earlier.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.509
Shortly after their arrival,

36:17.551 --> 36:21.430
many of the townspeople
died from an unknown illness.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.390
Goody Bassett was suspected

36:23.432 --> 36:25.642
of casting the spell that caused it.

36:31.023 --> 36:34.192
She was examined for marks of the witch.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.281
Goody was given one
last chance to confess.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.746
But in 1651,

36:45.787 --> 36:49.249
40 years before the Salem witch trials,

36:49.291 --> 36:52.002
Goody Bassett was hanged...

36:55.088 --> 36:56.590
only a short distance

36:56.632 --> 36:58.258
from where the Phelps'
mansion would stand

and so it's my hope of ridding us of her

39:03.300 --> 39:06.928
that we perform this séance tonight.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.847
Please, everyone.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.069
Let's join hands.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.323
[SIGH]

39:28.492 --> 39:30.118
Let us pray.

39:37.459 --> 39:42.798
We wish to speak with
the spirit of Ruth Paine.

39:42.839 --> 39:48.762
You were known in this
life as Goody Bassett,

39:48.804 --> 39:53.934
the witch who was hung in 1651.

39:53.975 --> 40:01.149
I believe I unjustly
called you from the beyond,

40:01.191 --> 40:05.195
and I believe it is
your wish to go home.

40:05.237 --> 40:08.031
And that's why we are
gathered here tonight...

40:08.073 --> 40:09.699
to help you go home.

40:12.828 --> 40:18.208
This house is not your home.

40:19.626 --> 40:23.964
This house... is not yours.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.511
And so it is time for you to leave.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.195
Goody Bassett,

40:47.237 --> 40:51.700
if you are amongst
us, please knock once.

41:14.431 --> 41:15.849
Elizabeth?

41:20.312 --> 41:22.606
Elizabeth Adams Phelps,

41:22.647 --> 41:25.275
who died in the year 1843...

41:27.986 --> 41:29.362
are you with us?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.200
Elizabeth.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.746
You are welcome here.

41:37.787 --> 41:40.081
We wish to help you find peace.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.461

41:56.598 --> 41:59.142
Mrs. Combs, please, please sit.

42:06.149 --> 42:11.196
If this is Elizabeth
Adams Phelps, knock once.

42:11.238 --> 42:12.948
If not, twice.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.994
[KNOCK KNOCK]

42:18.036 --> 42:21.081
This is not the spirit
of Elizabeth Adams Phelps?

42:21.122 --> 42:22.832
[GASP]

42:26.836 --> 42:29.422
Were you a member of my congregation?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.219
[THUMP THUMP]

42:34.261 --> 42:38.181
Do you know someone that is
sitting here at this table?

42:39.307 --> 42:41.059
[THUMP THUMP]

42:42.269 --> 42:45.355
Help us know who you are.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.609
[GASP] Oh.

42:55.407 --> 42:56.616
[SNARLING]

[COUGHING, WHEEZING]

[RETCHING]

43:13.508 --> 43:15.885
Be gone from this house!

43:44.247 --> 43:46.541
October 1st.

43:47.876 --> 43:51.713
We will be gone October 1st.

43:58.261 --> 44:00.347
In today's language we'd say

44:00.388 --> 44:03.600
that the Phelps story went viral.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.477
It became wildly popular

44:05.518 --> 44:06.936
after the account was published

44:06.978 --> 44:08.271
in newspapers, books,

44:08.313 --> 44:10.065
and magazines of the time.

44:15.862 --> 44:17.364
In 1888,

44:17.405 --> 44:19.366
the sisters who brought Spiritualism

44:19.407 --> 44:21.159
to the mainstream

44:21.201 --> 44:22.660
confessed.

44:26.748 --> 44:29.876
Both Fox sisters could
rotate their ankles

44:29.918 --> 44:34.339
and bend their toes in ways
that produced audible clicks.

44:34.381 --> 44:39.052
Every séance they performed
had been a trick, a fraud.

44:41.137 --> 44:43.390
But people continued to believe.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.392
[MAN MURMURING]

44:45.433 --> 44:47.477
Four years after the death

44:47.519 --> 44:50.855
of Sir Author Conan Doyle in 1930,

44:50.897 --> 44:54.109
a mass séance was held in London.

44:54.150 --> 44:56.277
And unlike his friend Houdini,

44:56.319 --> 44:59.447
it's claimed that Doyle did return

44:59.489 --> 45:02.492
and his voice was recorded.

45:02.534 --> 45:04.035
DOYLE'S VOICE:

45:33.773 --> 45:35.775
Whether or not you and I believe

45:35.817 --> 45:38.820
that the dead can
communicate with the living,

45:38.862 --> 45:40.488
Reverend Phelps believed

45:40.530 --> 45:41.990
that something had reached out

45:42.031 --> 45:43.575
and spoken to him.

45:45.285 --> 45:46.744
Yet his yearning

45:46.786 --> 45:49.164
for a final reunion with Elizabeth

45:49.205 --> 45:51.624
was never fulfilled.

45:51.666 --> 45:55.336
And so now he no longer had any use

45:55.378 --> 45:58.756
for a way to speak to the other side.

45:58.798 --> 46:02.427
But maybe there really is
something beyond the veil.

46:02.469 --> 46:06.055
Perhaps we can open the
door to the afterlife,

46:06.097 --> 46:08.308
or maybe not.

46:08.349 --> 46:11.019
It's an impossible question to answer,

46:11.060 --> 46:13.521
which is why we keep asking it.
