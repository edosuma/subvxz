04:42.785 --> 04:47.984
- 950 grams. Nice and juicy.
- That's a shoulder piece, isn't it?

04:48.185 --> 04:52.542
The Kube brothers get what they
always get. Tell me about it!

04:52.745 --> 04:56.021
- How much do we owe you?
- Two sacks.

05:05.345 --> 05:09.179
Oh, it's Mr Interligator.
How's the wife?

05:09.385 --> 05:11.376
She's doing poorly.

05:12.425 --> 05:15.895
- Roger, your shawl.
- But I've got my shawl.

05:16.105 --> 05:18.983
So she tried to commit suicide again?

05:23.905 --> 05:26.783
By some miracle, she's alive.

05:26.985 --> 05:30.534
Butcher, I think...

05:30.745 --> 05:33.543
- you're getting a customer.
- Who's next?

05:33.745 --> 05:35.224
I am.

05:43.105 --> 05:45.061
- That for me?
- At your service.

05:45.265 --> 05:47.301
Put it on my bill.

05:47.505 --> 05:50.224
We all know where she keeps her bill.

05:52.305 --> 05:53.374
OK, you're next.

05:57.545 --> 06:01.220
That damn carburettor.
This has happened before.

06:08.625 --> 06:13.540
That'll cost you... Iet's see...
the ride plus the luggage...

06:13.745 --> 06:15.622
How are you paying?

06:20.505 --> 06:23.815
- In lentils?
- That's all I have left.

06:24.865 --> 06:29.222
Listen, I'd settle for those shoes.

06:35.385 --> 06:38.821
- We're closed for the day.
- I didn't come about that.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.539
I don't eat meat anyway.

06:41.745 --> 06:43.975
- I came about the ad.
- What ad?

06:44.185 --> 06:46.699
- The ad in the paper.
- What paper?

06:46.905 --> 06:48.623
Hard Times.

06:50.025 --> 06:51.504
Hold on...

06:55.345 --> 06:58.781
"Light maintenance jobs.
Odd jobs. Room and board."

06:59.025 --> 07:01.220
"Room facing south."

07:01.425 --> 07:04.781
I do have the right address, don't I?
Number 129a?

07:04.985 --> 07:07.579
Whether here or there,
this is nowhere.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.936
That way we don't get
hassled by the neighbours.

07:13.425 --> 07:15.222
Nor by any visitors.

07:16.585 --> 07:18.576
Well...

07:18.785 --> 07:20.935
I must have made a mistake.

07:39.465 --> 07:43.617
Not so fast.
You're looking for a job, right?

07:43.825 --> 07:45.304
Come over here.

07:45.505 --> 07:48.417
- Turn around.
- Pardon me?

07:48.625 --> 07:50.820
Turn around.

07:51.025 --> 07:52.981
How much do you weigh?

07:53.185 --> 07:56.097
63 or 64 kilos. Why?

07:56.305 --> 08:00.184
You're not exactly hefty.
The job I've got takes muscle.

08:00.385 --> 08:03.183
- Don't worry about that.
- I'm a butcher.

08:03.385 --> 08:08.982
I'm straight with people. So I'd
say you haven't got what it takes.

08:09.185 --> 08:13.542
You don't have the body structure,
the right breadth.

08:13.745 --> 08:16.100
Nonetheless I'll give you a try.

08:16.305 --> 08:19.502
But you'll have to bust your ass.

08:19.705 --> 08:21.980
I'd call that a stroke of luck.

08:23.025 --> 08:25.095
- Thanks.
- Come on, let's go.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.944
So what exactly does the job entail?

08:28.145 --> 08:34.539
Light maintenance jobs. Odd jobs.
Room and board. Room facing south.

08:34.745 --> 08:38.703
- Just like in the ad?
- What do you know? Like in the ad.

08:41.825 --> 08:46.421
Hey, watch it. One of the steps
is loose. You'll have to fix that.

08:46.625 --> 08:52.734
And do all the painting, cleaning,
the electricity. The whole shebang.

08:57.265 --> 09:00.701
You'll like it here, you'll see.

09:00.905 --> 09:06.457
And there aren't any neighbours
opposite. The key is on this nail.

09:06.665 --> 09:09.225
Well, I'll let you get settled in.

09:13.105 --> 09:14.584
Thanks.

09:38.425 --> 09:42.179
- How are things in town?
- Terrible. Really terrible.

09:42.385 --> 09:46.583
It's the rationing. They'd eat
their shoes. Kind of touch and go.

09:46.785 --> 09:51.620
- They haven't got any street smarts.
- It's a mess. Till things grow back.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.385
Nothing will ever grow back. Ever.

09:54.585 --> 10:00.455
- You're quite the optimist.
- Get that through your thick skull.

10:00.665 --> 10:03.463
- Well, is your hair growing back?
- No.

10:03.665 --> 10:05.895
You see? It's the same thing.

11:13.825 --> 11:18.023
Couldn't we open
that window for five minutes?

11:20.985 --> 11:26.617
I like the smell of glue. It smells
like fish. It brings back memories.

11:34.585 --> 11:37.338
What do you think of the new guy?

11:38.385 --> 11:40.819
Are you deaf or something?

11:43.305 --> 11:44.784
He's skinny.

11:49.745 --> 11:52.020
Still thinking of her, huh?

11:53.785 --> 11:56.822
Apparently she's hearing voices now.

12:20.145 --> 12:23.820
Would it be too much of an effort
to put that a bit closer?

13:53.465 --> 13:54.944
Hello.

16:42.865 --> 16:46.301
Ma'am...

16:47.345 --> 16:51.497
She's deaf as a post. This way
we always know where she is.

16:51.705 --> 16:57.223
Granny, go back upstairs to your
room. There's nothing left. Now go.

17:01.465 --> 17:06.220
You finished? Then don't hang around.
Fix the bulb on the 2nd floor.

17:13.305 --> 17:15.375
- Hi, butcher.
- Hi, postman.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.338
- Got a parcel for your daughter.
- Upstairs.

17:29.385 --> 17:31.853
- Watch the step.
- Mind your business.

17:37.625 --> 17:39.980
Grab it, Marcel.

17:41.025 --> 17:45.815
- I've got it.
- Throw it over here. Throw it.

17:48.185 --> 17:50.096
You shit.

18:00.105 --> 18:03.336
Postal Administration. Article 12.

18:03.545 --> 18:07.743
You've got exactly 20 seconds
to get back to your flats.

18:07.945 --> 18:11.415
- Move.
- You don't have kids to feed.

18:15.905 --> 18:17.975
That applies to kids as well.

18:30.665 --> 18:32.576
Can't you read, moron?

18:32.785 --> 18:35.458
- "Julie Clapet."
- He's a friend.

18:35.665 --> 18:38.384
A friend?

18:40.825 --> 18:42.417
Here, Julie.

18:45.025 --> 18:46.663
Sign here, Julie.

18:46.865 --> 18:51.143
I call you Julie because I like you.
But I don't want to rush you.

18:55.065 --> 18:57.021
See you, Julie.

19:04.865 --> 19:09.017
- Here. For the ad.
- Always at your service.

19:09.225 --> 19:13.423
- That new guy is kind of weird.
- He used to be a circus man.

19:19.105 --> 19:23.621
I'm sure this contains some tidbits
to eat. That's why they're...

19:27.105 --> 19:31.895
- Would you like to taste them?
- Yes. I'd love to.

19:32.105 --> 19:36.098
Shall we say at 7? That'll
give me time to get things ready.

19:43.985 --> 19:45.896
- Is he after her?
- After who?

19:46.105 --> 19:50.303
Your daughter. She's a cute slip
of a thing. She needs someone.

19:50.505 --> 19:54.384
- That someone is me. Is that clear?
- Hey, I've got news.

19:54.585 --> 19:58.373
They shot one down two days ago.
A superb 30-metre target.

19:58.585 --> 20:00.974
- No bodies?
- They cart them away.

20:01.185 --> 20:04.655
Bloody vermin.
They even say they eat money.

20:04.865 --> 20:10.144
We've got to get rid of them for
good, those vegetable-eating queers.

20:10.345 --> 20:13.018
They'll get what's coming to them.

20:13.945 --> 20:15.822
THE ENEMY PLOTS AGAINST US

20:16.265 --> 20:18.540
- Bye, butcher.
- Bye, postman.

20:26.145 --> 20:29.979
- Do you think that's it for tonight?
- I hope so.

20:31.025 --> 20:34.938
That goddamn butcher,
I'm sure he won't do it tonight.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.943
He's taking his time
just to make me mad.

20:39.145 --> 20:43.218
- He's obviously succeeded.
- What's he waiting for anyway?

20:43.425 --> 20:46.974
Till the new guy tries to escape
in a garbage can, too?

20:48.505 --> 20:53.021
- How long did the other guy last us?
- A week.

20:57.425 --> 20:59.814
Not counting the broth, that is.

21:11.785 --> 21:15.937
One week. We polished off
the last chunk two days ago.

21:18.505 --> 21:23.181
I'm hungry. I'm bloody starving.

21:23.385 --> 21:25.421
I'm fucking starving.

22:24.945 --> 22:31.418
My little Hercule... Every man
for himself, and God for all.

24:12.185 --> 24:15.018
- Hi there. It's me.
- Hello.

24:16.985 --> 24:18.464
Come in.

24:19.665 --> 24:22.225
Please, do come in.

24:24.225 --> 24:26.864
- For you.
- Thank you.

24:27.065 --> 24:28.623
Sit down.

24:32.905 --> 24:38.616
- Did you paint that?
- Yes, it's nothing much.

24:40.265 --> 24:43.814
- No, no...
- No problem.

24:52.865 --> 24:55.663
I've made a pot of tea.

24:55.865 --> 24:59.221
- Shall I pour you a cup?
- Yes, please.

25:03.705 --> 25:08.415
- I hope you don't find me too bold.
- Oh, no. Not at all.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.742
- Why should I?
- A girl invites you to her flat.

25:11.945 --> 25:15.381
Some would consider that
a bit brazen.

25:15.585 --> 25:19.624
- Well, actually...
- And thank you for this morning.

25:19.825 --> 25:25.422
- Why thank you?
- You rescued my parcel on the steps.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.822
I was very moved by your concern.

25:30.265 --> 25:32.415
That goes without saying.

25:34.345 --> 25:40.295
No, on the contrary. People usually
only think of themselves nowadays.

25:52.265 --> 25:57.419
Only because they have nothing.
Deep down, they're still good people.

25:58.865 --> 26:02.096
I'm glad to hear they like me.
They're very kind.

26:04.545 --> 26:09.335
I'm getting along with your father,
too. He thinks I'm a nice guy, right?

26:10.505 --> 26:13.702
- Why not try Kraft cheese spread?
- That's new.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.102
- And handy.
- They talk to me about you.

26:18.145 --> 26:20.943
- Who?
- The voices in my head.

26:21.145 --> 26:26.014
Oh, right. The voices.
And what do they say?

26:27.105 --> 26:32.259
Hold on, let me try to remember...

26:32.465 --> 26:38.574
- It's more the language they use.
- Do they talk about love?

26:38.785 --> 26:40.264
Oh, no.

26:41.665 --> 26:45.977
"Robert's a pervert, an arse wipe,
a panty eater." You see?

26:46.185 --> 26:47.777
But that's not true.

26:50.105 --> 26:53.495
Aurore, you're missing
something really funny.

26:53.705 --> 26:57.380
At any rate, I have no choice.
Here. Tomorrow at 11 sharp.

26:57.585 --> 27:01.294
- Ring me. I'm counting on you.
- But...

27:03.345 --> 27:04.937
"Arse wipe"?

27:05.145 --> 27:09.616
Move out? What for?
I've just moved in.

27:09.825 --> 27:13.943
Because it's pretty awful here.
The building is unsanitary.

27:14.145 --> 27:16.659
The walls are falling apart,
and it leaks.

27:17.705 --> 27:20.378
- Perhaps you don't like me?
- Me?

27:20.585 --> 27:25.420
- You act as if you want me to leave.
- No, on the contrary. Not at all...

27:29.185 --> 27:31.540
It does that once in a while.

27:42.705 --> 27:44.138
Did I hurt you?

27:45.185 --> 27:48.814
- I'll be all right.
- Then it must be the shock.

27:49.025 --> 27:51.858
I'm such a klutz.

27:52.065 --> 27:53.544
Don't move.

28:09.345 --> 28:13.816
I'm blind as a bat.
Everything's all foggy.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.813
I could get lost in that fog.

28:28.025 --> 28:31.700
Leave it. I buy two of everything
because I break things.

28:40.305 --> 28:42.865
- So you play the cello?
- Yes.

28:43.065 --> 28:45.625
I play an instrument as well.

28:47.105 --> 28:48.743
Will you wait for me?

28:52.705 --> 28:56.175
- Oh, shit. Not again.
- What are you doing?

28:56.385 --> 28:58.694
- I wanted to draw a bath.
- Again?

28:58.905 --> 29:02.420
Well, you sharpen your knives
often enough, too.

29:08.505 --> 29:10.700
A musical saw...

29:10.905 --> 29:14.022
- It has a nice sound.
- Sit down.

29:16.305 --> 29:19.456
- The doctor and I had an act once.
- Doctor?

29:19.665 --> 29:23.419
Livingstone. "Dr Livingstone".

29:23.625 --> 29:25.377
He was my partner.

29:26.425 --> 29:29.622
- But now he's gone.
- Where did he go?

29:30.705 --> 29:35.017
He disappeared after a show.
We only found his remains.

29:36.145 --> 29:38.295
They'd eaten him.

29:38.505 --> 29:42.020
Can you imagine that? They ate him.

29:43.785 --> 29:48.575
I lost everything that night.
So, the first ad I ran across...

29:48.785 --> 29:53.142
- And here I am.
- I need to tell you something.

29:54.345 --> 29:56.017
Listen.

30:08.505 --> 30:11.019
Do you know that tune?

30:11.225 --> 30:13.181
It was his favourite.

31:01.345 --> 31:05.179
Have you noticed
how clear the nights have been?

31:05.385 --> 31:09.424
That's normal. We're entering
the Virgo age. That's my sign.

31:10.465 --> 31:14.014
- No kidding?
- I swear it. My ascendant is Leo.

31:16.225 --> 31:20.423
Cut it out. Not everyone's Gorilla,
ascendant Bulldozer.

31:20.625 --> 31:25.904
I'm in luck, there's more in store.
"Get ready, the wind's shifting."

31:26.105 --> 31:28.778
You'd like to pack up
and leave, right?

31:28.985 --> 31:33.342
You wouldn't get far. It's worse
out there, they draw straws.

31:33.545 --> 31:38.824
And it'd be a shame to lose these
juicy hams. These little sucklings...

31:39.865 --> 31:42.425
Stop joking around. I don't like it.

31:45.985 --> 31:48.977
You're better off here.
At least we have a system.

31:49.185 --> 31:53.224
My ass! Your helpers are drawing
straws, too. What about that ad?

31:53.425 --> 31:54.904
That's fate.

31:56.825 --> 31:59.419
You can't change fate.

32:06.465 --> 32:11.016
It's like you said:
the wind is shifting.

32:12.065 --> 32:13.976
Everyone's going to get it.

32:39.905 --> 32:44.456
Mr Louison,
I shouldn't tell you this, but ..

32:46.065 --> 32:50.138
What happened to your friend...
the same thing goes on here.

32:50.345 --> 32:53.735
It takes place at night
in the stairwell.

32:53.945 --> 32:56.413
That's why no one ever goes out.

32:58.865 --> 33:00.821
And my father...

33:13.625 --> 33:15.456
SOPORIFIC HERBAL TEA

36:06.585 --> 36:08.974
Hi. I'm here to fix
the box springs.

36:09.185 --> 36:11.016
Come in.

36:18.945 --> 36:21.903
This is an antique.
It's seen a lot of use.

36:22.105 --> 36:24.380
- Yes.
- What seems to be the problem?

36:24.585 --> 36:26.974
It squeaks. I find it bothersome.

36:29.745 --> 36:33.420
Could you bounce around on it a bit?
Just so I can hear?

36:39.865 --> 36:44.302
- I can't see what's wrong.
- It squeaks most when there are two.

36:47.425 --> 36:49.017
Let's give it a try.

37:53.385 --> 37:57.014
Just as I thought,
it's the 2nd spring to the right.

37:58.065 --> 38:02.343
Come, Aurore...

38:07.625 --> 38:11.015
We are here, Aurore...

38:11.225 --> 38:15.582
to help you.

38:15.785 --> 38:21.462
Come...

38:21.665 --> 38:24.816
Freed from life...

38:25.025 --> 38:29.974
come with us, Aurore.

38:30.185 --> 38:33.416
Tranquil and at peace...

38:33.625 --> 38:39.621
Aurore, come...

38:40.345 --> 38:42.813
COME AT 11 SHARP.
RING HARD.

38:52.505 --> 38:56.464
Rotten world ...

39:48.665 --> 39:50.417
That should do it.

39:52.385 --> 39:54.455
- Here.
- Thanks.

39:56.345 --> 39:58.984
- What are "Troglodists"?
- Outlaws.

39:59.185 --> 40:03.781
- But no one ever sees them.
- Just tales to distract the people.

40:03.985 --> 40:07.660
- A typical Capricorn attitude.
- Wrong. I'm Aquarius.

40:07.865 --> 40:09.662
- Oh?
- A sign of the future.

40:09.865 --> 40:12.333
Oh, the future...

40:12.545 --> 40:15.343
It soon becomes history around here.

40:15.545 --> 40:19.094
- It's very easy to miss a step.
- Don't worry about me.

40:19.305 --> 40:22.138
You brats, give that
back this instant.

40:22.345 --> 40:25.735
Rémi, stop sniggering
or I'll give you a whacking.

40:25.945 --> 40:30.700
I'll beat the one with the other,
do you hear? Give that back.

40:31.905 --> 40:36.137
Oh, great! How will we get
that back now, you guttersnipes?

40:36.345 --> 40:39.337
This is a job for the Australian.

40:39.545 --> 40:41.024
The Australian?

40:43.585 --> 40:45.064
The Australian.

40:48.225 --> 40:50.181
Stand back.

40:59.265 --> 41:02.223
That's quite a tool.

41:02.825 --> 41:06.420
The Australian is nothing
without its master.

41:06.625 --> 41:07.978
Wow, did you see that?

41:08.985 --> 41:13.456
- Tapioca, did you find a job yet?
- No. Nothing yet.

41:13.665 --> 41:18.216
Bad news. You're running up quite
a bill. Not to mention the rent.

41:18.425 --> 41:23.135
I'm in a fix at the moment. But I've
got something here. Want a look?

41:23.345 --> 41:26.542
Black market? In these times?
You make me sick.

41:26.745 --> 41:28.815
Just take a look.

41:30.985 --> 41:34.136
A rat-call. The female cry.
It attract males.

41:34.345 --> 41:37.303
So? There aren't any rats left.
What's that?

41:37.505 --> 41:41.896
- This? A bullshit detector.
- Oh, yeah?

41:42.105 --> 41:45.256
- Come on, give it a try.
- Give what a try?

41:45.465 --> 41:48.662
Start bullshitting. Come on.

41:48.865 --> 41:51.504
- Come on...
- I can't do it on command.

41:52.745 --> 41:54.542
Life is wonderful.

41:54.745 --> 41:59.136
Your bullshit detector is shit.
Turn that thing off. It's too loud.

41:59.345 --> 42:05.580
If you don't settle your bill soon,
you'll find yourself on my hook.

42:05.785 --> 42:10.176
Very funny. What about that clown?
Isn't that taking a tad too long?

42:10.385 --> 42:15.061
- Everyone in the building is edgy.
- Not before he's redone the ceiling.

42:15.265 --> 42:20.942
And in the meantime, to hell with us,
right? I've got mouths to feed.

42:21.145 --> 42:26.299
- Yeah, the granny's, for instance.
- For instance... Why bring her up?

42:26.505 --> 42:30.180
- I've got my reasons.
- What do you mean by that?

42:30.385 --> 42:33.457
Want to pay up?
Give me the granny tonight.

42:33.665 --> 42:36.304
She's one of us.
It's against the rules.

42:36.505 --> 42:40.214
The rules, the rules...
The age limit is a rule, too.

42:40.425 --> 42:44.020
- She's only good for pâté.
- She's my mother-in-law.

42:44.225 --> 42:48.662
- Why not take Mrs Interligator?
- Stop yelling.

42:48.865 --> 42:51.220
- It'd be an act of charity.
- Please.

42:52.865 --> 42:57.017
Interligator is fond of his wife.
He's a good tenant. He pays.

42:57.225 --> 42:59.864
The bloody rich.
They always manage.

43:00.065 --> 43:03.774
You haven't got much choice
in view of your debts.

43:26.865 --> 43:29.982
Oh, it's you, Julie.

43:30.185 --> 43:33.575
- You gave me a fright.
- Counting your money again?

43:33.785 --> 43:36.902
Well, yes. Tell me...

43:37.105 --> 43:41.735
You don't come to see me very often.
It's nice of you to come.

43:41.945 --> 43:47.338
- Well, did you like your gift?
- It must have cost you a bundle.

43:47.545 --> 43:51.220
Well, yes.
Anything to make you happy.

43:51.425 --> 43:55.816
- You've loved sweets since you...
- But I don't any more.

44:05.225 --> 44:09.184
- Let him go.
- You always ask the same thing.

44:09.385 --> 44:13.139
- It's the same old story every time.
- No, this time...

44:13.345 --> 44:17.816
This time it's different? True. Just
look at you. I know what he's up to.

44:18.025 --> 44:22.098
With his puppy eyes. Making
your head spin with his dreams...

44:22.305 --> 44:24.819
- There's no room for dreams.
- Stop that.

44:25.025 --> 44:29.018
It's a tough world out there.
I didn't make the world.

44:30.465 --> 44:34.344
I know you hate my trade,
but it's an art like any other.

44:34.545 --> 44:39.494
- Let him leave this place.
- With you? You won't last two weeks.

44:39.705 --> 44:43.778
- I don't want to lose you.
- You lost me long ago.

44:43.985 --> 44:45.464
Julie...

45:19.025 --> 45:22.734
TROGLODISM: AN UNDERGROUND
ORGANISATION?

48:26.185 --> 48:32.420
Good evening, old girl. Guess what?
Let's play a little game, OK?

48:32.625 --> 48:35.503
I'll scare you, and you'll scream.

48:35.705 --> 48:39.254
That little clown upstairs
will rush to your rescue.

48:39.465 --> 48:41.103
Let's begin, OK?

48:52.385 --> 48:56.060
Go for it!
Planning to take my picture or what?

48:56.265 --> 48:58.825
Scream, goddamn it.

50:19.865 --> 50:24.381
You came from the N.E. sector to
annoy us with your beau's troubles?

50:24.585 --> 50:28.863
- Mr Louison.
- I don't know him. No names. No I.D.

50:29.065 --> 50:32.421
- We're at war, girlie.
- We're outlaws. He's Rolls.

50:32.625 --> 50:34.775
- Voltange.
- Rolan. Tourneur. Milan.

50:34.985 --> 50:38.022
- Trap.
- Pank. Fox. Paumeau.

50:38.225 --> 50:42.104
- We watch out for moles.
- You could be one.

50:42.305 --> 50:46.617
- I'm not a liar. It's the truth.
- You, a surfacer? Talk about truth?

50:46.825 --> 50:49.862
Do you know what this is?
Take a close look.

50:50.065 --> 50:54.775
- Your brother Matt's shirt.
- Shot down like a rabbit.

50:54.985 --> 50:59.103
- Now that's the truth.
- Common game. That's all we are.

50:59.305 --> 51:02.058
- And you're predators.
- Not me. I swear.

51:02.265 --> 51:05.462
- You're one of them. A carnivore.
- What?

51:05.665 --> 51:08.463
Is that the way
you rats treat ladies?

51:16.305 --> 51:18.455
- Hey, watch it!
- For God's sake!

51:20.145 --> 51:22.215
Oh, my God.

51:23.745 --> 51:28.023
Tell Calamity Jane to smarten up,
or all hell will break loose.

51:28.225 --> 51:31.979
- Got it.
- A month's harvest is on the floor.

51:32.185 --> 51:34.301
- Plus the risks.
- Matt died for that.

51:34.505 --> 51:36.973
Right. Tell her.

51:37.185 --> 51:40.063
Corn...

51:41.905 --> 51:47.423
There's plenty more in my building.
30 large bags in my dad's cellar.

51:48.625 --> 51:52.334
- What's this guy of yours look like?
- Louison, Rolls...

51:52.545 --> 51:56.299
Yeah, the guy you want us to pick up.

52:03.745 --> 52:07.454
- Can I help you, miss?
- No, just an old coffee grinder.

52:07.665 --> 52:10.384
Coffee? Some people have it made.

52:10.585 --> 52:13.975
So you went for a walk last night?
A long one at that.

52:14.185 --> 52:18.736
First ruckus, then screams.
This building is a madhouse.

52:18.945 --> 52:22.620
Your father may work at night,
but this is going too far.

52:31.465 --> 52:33.820
There you are, Julie.

52:38.625 --> 52:40.104
You OK?

52:43.785 --> 52:47.460
Sorry, I was just
rehearsing a new number.

52:48.825 --> 52:50.304
Hold on...

52:56.585 --> 52:58.064
Here.

53:03.705 --> 53:06.219
Didn't you hear anything last night?

53:06.425 --> 53:09.064
No, your tea made sure ofthat.

53:09.265 --> 53:12.018
A pot of tea a night,
just as you prescribed.

53:12.225 --> 53:15.217
I'll get you some more,
you're almost all out.

53:15.425 --> 53:19.020
You should drink some, too.
You look exhausted.

53:26.119 --> 53:30.158
- Cheer up, she died a natural death.
- Come on, let's go.

53:30.359 --> 53:34.318
But still, I'd have
liked to say goodbye.

53:34.519 --> 53:37.079
Why don't we do that right now?

53:48.399 --> 53:50.276
Poor Robert.

53:51.359 --> 53:55.955
What made you rush out
into the stairwell at night anyway?

53:57.719 --> 54:01.109
I did it for Aurore.
I wanted to save her.

54:01.319 --> 54:04.709
I'm telling you, she wasn't
the one who screamed.

54:04.919 --> 54:07.797
Anyway, here you go.

54:07.999 --> 54:09.796
Still, I did it for her.

54:09.999 --> 54:13.389
The butcher was very decent.
He apologised.

54:13.599 --> 54:16.909
Invite you to dinner?
I haven't got much.

54:17.119 --> 54:20.555
That's fine. That way
we won't feel weighed down.

54:20.759 --> 54:23.637
- At 9 p.m.?
- Sharp. I'm always on time.

54:23.839 --> 54:29.197
- Rather unusual for a girl, right?
- For a girl, you're rather unusual.

54:29.399 --> 54:31.435
I owe you a lot, you know?

54:32.479 --> 54:35.516
- Did you forgive them...
- For Livingstone?

54:35.719 --> 54:41.715
- One must always forgive.
- Depends. It's not always possible.

54:41.919 --> 54:45.036
Don't say that.
No one is completely evil.

54:45.239 --> 54:50.677
It depends on circumstance. Or they
don't realise they've done wrong.

55:16.079 --> 55:21.870
36th sector, 5th division.
Squirmer's Avenue.

55:23.479 --> 55:26.471
What did that girl say? The girl!

55:29.119 --> 55:33.078
Sector 3/4, 69° north-east.

55:34.839 --> 55:38.548
Albumin Square. Here.
All right, let's go.

55:39.479 --> 55:45.315
Scout to Sauce Master. Heading
towards target, 69° north-east.

55:45.519 --> 55:51.071
Sauce Master to Scout.
Read you, over and out.

55:52.119 --> 55:55.668
Watch your backsides, guys!

56:14.999 --> 56:19.356
Come, Aurore...

56:19.559 --> 56:22.710
They are the worm...

56:22.919 --> 56:27.470
you are the fruit.

56:39.759 --> 56:41.556
Not again! Darn it!

57:00.719 --> 57:02.596
It seems rather quiet.

57:12.839 --> 57:16.514
Not Father's golf clubs.

57:16.719 --> 57:20.997
Yes, Father's clubs...

57:29.599 --> 57:32.875
- Know who's on TV tonight?
- I don't have a TV.

57:33.079 --> 57:36.469
Look, isn't that your customer?

57:40.919 --> 57:46.039
- Shit.
- I'm a bit pressed for time.

57:46.239 --> 57:51.154
No offence, but would you permit me
to come back later tonight...

57:51.359 --> 57:54.271
to pay my respects to your daughter?

58:25.639 --> 58:28.597
- Danger, we know not.
- Audacious, that's us.

58:28.799 --> 58:30.915
Courageous, give me three.

58:31.119 --> 58:33.872
Generous, you, you, you and me.

58:42.839 --> 58:47.435
Scout to Sauce Master.
Corn located at site.

58:47.639 --> 58:50.551
I repeat: corn located at site.

58:50.759 --> 58:54.274
Proceeding with reconnaissance
mission. Target: Louison.

58:54.479 --> 58:57.277
I repeat: target, Louison.

59:34.999 --> 59:37.149
An ambush.

59:39.679 --> 59:43.274
- Aurore, what's the matter now?
- Georges...

01:00:03.079 --> 01:00:08.915
Throw in your apron?
Now I've heard it all.

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:13.351
I've been thinking about it
for a while now. I'm getting older.

01:00:13.559 --> 01:00:17.108
I'm losing my touch.
And so many victims...

01:00:17.319 --> 01:00:21.107
- I feel sorry for them.
- Sorry? That's not like you.

01:00:21.319 --> 01:00:24.277
No one's entirely evil.
It's circumstance.

01:00:24.479 --> 01:00:27.073
Or they don't realise
they've done wrong.

01:00:27.279 --> 01:00:31.511
Some say you have to be able
to forgive. Do you forgive me?

01:00:31.719 --> 01:00:34.358
An old bastard like you?

01:00:35.479 --> 01:00:37.709
- Maybe I could.
- You're sweet.

01:00:37.919 --> 01:00:41.753
The guys you finished off
wouldn't forgive you, though.

01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:46.475
- You'd really have to insist on it.
- If only Julie could forgive me.

01:00:46.679 --> 01:00:50.274
- Have you asked her?
- She wouldn't ever.

01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:54.154
- But you're her father.
- She won't even speak to me.

01:00:56.679 --> 01:01:00.433
Want me to go see her?
I could explain it all to her.

01:01:01.799 --> 01:01:06.475
All she cares about is that Louison.
But then, he's not such a bad guy.

01:01:06.679 --> 01:01:12.356
By the way, he's on TV tonight.
Why don't you go tell him?

01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:16.029
I bet he doesn't know.
He has his head in the clouds.

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:29.275
- You should really eat something.
- Not hungry.

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.798
Not hungry.

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.598
Fox...

01:01:45.679 --> 01:01:49.035
You've been hiding things.
You're on TV tonight.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:52.754
What do you know about that!
Livingstone.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.075
The Criekville Casino.

01:01:56.119 --> 01:01:59.031
Our Tica Tica Walk
was a big hit back then.

01:01:59.239 --> 01:02:00.877
Tica Tica what?

01:02:38.399 --> 01:02:39.878
Oh, shit.

01:02:41.319 --> 01:02:45.517
- So that's your new number?
- I can explain, Julie.

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:48.677
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

01:02:54.439 --> 01:02:56.475
I messed things up again.

01:03:04.439 --> 01:03:07.988
- He's got clown shoes.
- Mission accomplished.

01:03:08.199 --> 01:03:10.474
We'll wait for the others.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.152
Julie?

01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:11.035
Recipe 8: Cordon Bleu to Sniper.
Artichoke Heart Soufflé.

01:04:11.239 --> 01:04:13.992
- Quiet down.
- Artichoke Heart Soufflé.

01:04:14.199 --> 01:04:19.876
Preparation: H minus 35 minutes.
Then the onions. Simmer the snipers.

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:24.914
Cover them for about 15 minutes.
I repeat: for about 15 minutes.

01:04:25.119 --> 01:04:30.876
H minus 20 minutes: stir the sauce.
I repeat: H minus 20 minutes.

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:43.629
THE STARS OF THE CIRCUS

01:04:49.279 --> 01:04:52.316
Julie, I didn't think you'd come.

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:57.274
- Good evening...
- I'll have a cup of tea.

01:04:57.479 --> 01:05:00.516
- Pardon?
- I'll have a cup of tea.

01:05:00.719 --> 01:05:02.277
A cup of tea?

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.232
You have...

01:05:07.799 --> 01:05:10.518
I'll have one as well.

01:05:10.719 --> 01:05:13.279
Yes, a nice cup of tea.

01:05:16.599 --> 01:05:21.275
Aurore, come and watch.
It's spellbinding.

01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:33.872
Come, Aurore...

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:38.197
Come...

01:05:57.319 --> 01:06:00.675
- You're wearing...
- I found some contact lenses.

01:06:00.879 --> 01:06:04.872
...they'll titillate us.
Here's Stan and Livingstone.

01:06:15.279 --> 01:06:19.557
- You never told me about this.
- Julie...

01:06:19.759 --> 01:06:23.274
that's Livingstone.
Livingstone, Julie.

01:06:53.679 --> 01:06:57.308
- I don't believe this.
- It's the antenna, Dad.

01:06:57.519 --> 01:06:59.987
- What a drag.
- It's the antenna.

01:07:00.199 --> 01:07:04.192
- Go and fix the wire.
- In this storm? No way.

01:07:10.759 --> 01:07:12.272
That bastard.

01:07:14.199 --> 01:07:17.157
It's the antenna.
Because of the wind.

01:07:27.559 --> 01:07:29.038
Louison.

01:07:36.199 --> 01:07:39.748
Aurore...

01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:42.314
come...

01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:49.271
It's so much better here, near us...

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:09.757
Come...

01:08:23.919 --> 01:08:27.229
Louison...

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:29.509
- What?
- Come back.

01:08:29.719 --> 01:08:31.277
I can't hear you.

01:08:33.599 --> 01:08:35.317
Come back.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.270
Go back inside, Julie.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:42.077
Watch out.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:00.872
Mr Louison?

01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:15.318
No...

01:09:49.879 --> 01:09:52.268
To the right.

01:09:53.799 --> 01:09:55.198
A bit more.

01:10:03.479 --> 01:10:06.516
Yes. OK. Perfect. Perfect!

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:09.028
Leave it the way is. Perfect.

01:10:12.879 --> 01:10:15.234
Georges...

01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:19.238
Aurore?

01:10:45.799 --> 01:10:48.916
- No more Robert...
- I fell.

01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:55.831
That pervert who just wants
to drag you down into the mire...

01:10:56.039 --> 01:11:00.157
down into the sewer, into the sew...

01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:05.710
- So it was you all along.
- No.

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:08.479
Since when have you been doing this?

01:11:08.679 --> 01:11:11.751
- No, I can explain.
- You bastard.

01:11:11.959 --> 01:11:16.350
It comes from downstairs.
You'll hurt your leg, Robert.

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:20.037
Stop.

01:11:31.359 --> 01:11:34.078
Help, help!

01:11:39.839 --> 01:11:42.478
You shit. Son of a bitch.

01:11:42.679 --> 01:11:45.068
- I fell.
- Yes, Aurore.

01:11:45.279 --> 01:11:48.237
I wanted to get up on the chair.
I fell.

01:11:48.439 --> 01:11:49.918
Yes, Aurore.

01:12:03.879 --> 01:12:07.633
The Troglos. The Troglos
are kidnapping someone.

01:12:07.839 --> 01:12:09.875
Les Troglos...

01:12:24.839 --> 01:12:29.549
How nice of you to make coffee,
Julie. Expecting company?

01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:36.795
Take your clothes off.

01:12:55.119 --> 01:12:57.952
- Julie, hurry.
- That Interligator woman...

01:12:58.159 --> 01:13:01.754
blew herself up sky high.
Took her husband with her.

01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:06.510
Where are you going?
Stop them, Robert.

01:13:10.959 --> 01:13:15.669
Julie, what are you doing here?
Wipe that muck off your face.

01:13:15.879 --> 01:13:20.191
Do you hear me? Go home this instant.
And wipe off that lipstick.

01:13:20.399 --> 01:13:25.519
And you, I'll skin you alive.
Just you wait. I'll get you yet.

01:13:25.719 --> 01:13:27.516
I'll get you.

01:13:28.999 --> 01:13:31.467
Just you wait.

01:13:36.519 --> 01:13:39.875
- Who goes there?
- Snipers.

01:13:42.479 --> 01:13:47.314
How did it go? Everything all right?
Everybody OK?

01:13:47.519 --> 01:13:50.477
Hey, Tourneur, look what I found.

01:13:53.079 --> 01:13:56.674
- Yes, but how about the others?
- Here they are.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:06.876
- How did it go?
- Easy. Virtually fell into our arms.

01:14:07.079 --> 01:14:10.469
And we're all here.

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.715
Shit.

01:14:13.919 --> 01:14:16.752
- Where did she come from?
- What the hell...

01:14:16.959 --> 01:14:20.235
- Shit.
- Pank...

01:14:20.439 --> 01:14:25.718
Is that the guy we were supposed
to grab? The target you located?

01:14:25.919 --> 01:14:30.549
- Pank, can you explain this to us?
- Wasn't that the plan?

01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:34.798
"Albumin Square. Name: Louison."
That's what it says.

01:14:34.999 --> 01:14:39.675
But it also says: "Sex: male.
Shoes: that of a clown's."

01:14:39.879 --> 01:14:45.636
- Then we'd better check it out.
- Sex: male. Male!

01:14:45.839 --> 01:14:50.071
- So? What of it?
- OK, so tell me, is the sex male?

01:14:50.279 --> 01:14:54.158
Not my problem.
Our mission was Louison. You got it.

01:14:54.359 --> 01:15:00.275
Louison...is the package here male?
Yes or no?

01:15:03.879 --> 01:15:06.268
I guess we should check it out.

01:15:10.199 --> 01:15:14.477
Sorry, Louison, just part of the job.

01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:18.469
I must have landed in a loony bin.

01:15:18.679 --> 01:15:23.434
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.
There's been a mistake, so let me go.

01:15:23.639 --> 01:15:26.472
See, guys?
Female through and through.

01:15:28.799 --> 01:15:33.589
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.
Artichoke Heart here.

01:15:33.799 --> 01:15:39.271
I repeat: Artichoke Heart.
In immediate danger.

01:15:39.479 --> 01:15:43.438
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:49.191
- Artichoke Heart is in danger.
- We'll knock them off like flies.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:55.114
- Must be cooking up there.
- You can count on those weirdos.

01:15:55.319 --> 01:15:58.675
- They'll fix your buddy for good.
- Should we go?

01:15:58.879 --> 01:16:01.393
Of course you're going. All of you.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:04.671
- Doesn't she ever shut up?
- They play rough.

01:16:04.879 --> 01:16:07.677
But an agreement is an agreement.

01:16:09.719 --> 01:16:15.476
Who's not in? Rap, you're coming
with me. Milan, Fox, Tourneur...

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:20.309
- You take the others. Move it.
- But what about me?

01:16:20.519 --> 01:16:22.908
What about me?

01:16:23.119 --> 01:16:28.512
Don't forget about me. What about me?

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:30.471
You assholes.

01:16:48.039 --> 01:16:50.678
In case I don't come back.

01:16:53.239 --> 01:16:54.991
Open up.

01:16:57.159 --> 01:17:03.394
Give it up, you dimwit.
We'll let you go. I swear.

01:17:03.599 --> 01:17:09.276
We won't touch you.
We'll forget the whole thing, OK?

01:17:12.519 --> 01:17:17.513
- My cleavers. All of them.
- Right, the cleavers. Kill them off.

01:17:17.719 --> 01:17:21.029
- Think you're on a safari, bitch?
- That's my wife.

01:17:21.239 --> 01:17:26.871
- No men or women, only volunteers.
- You got it. Obedient volunteers.

01:17:29.279 --> 01:17:34.751
Harm one hair of my daughter's head,
and I'll carve you up into pieces.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:42.035
- So, go get my cleavers. Move it.
- On the double.

01:17:51.639 --> 01:17:53.595
Where are you?

01:17:58.999 --> 01:18:01.149
Where are you?

01:18:02.839 --> 01:18:04.830
I don't like this one bit.

01:18:08.399 --> 01:18:13.348
It won't be long now.
Julie, get out of here.

01:18:13.559 --> 01:18:17.950
Yes. It's me they're after.

01:18:18.159 --> 01:18:22.311
Don't cry. I'll be all right.

01:18:22.519 --> 01:18:24.714
- Don't cry.
- It's my contacts.

01:18:24.919 --> 01:18:26.398
What?

01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:52.876
Julie, there's only
one thing left to do.

01:19:03.719 --> 01:19:08.918
Go on, push. Push.

01:20:23.279 --> 01:20:28.672
- What are you doing? Move your butt.
- Can't. I've gained too much weight.

01:20:32.079 --> 01:20:36.869
Wait, turn back. Tourneur, wait.

01:20:42.279 --> 01:20:46.158
- Shit, Tourneur's been hit.
- Tourneur's been hit.

01:21:01.359 --> 01:21:05.671
- Hey, postman. Everything OK?
- I got one. Come and see.

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:19.515
- These monsters are everywhere.
- They've lost one.

01:21:19.719 --> 01:21:21.675
They won't be back.

01:21:32.799 --> 01:21:36.075
Good ol' Tourneur. Hang in there.

01:21:39.119 --> 01:21:41.679
That lead really weighs you down.

01:21:42.919 --> 01:21:47.515
- No other damage?
- Don't worry. We'll get you out.

01:21:47.719 --> 01:21:51.075
You all right?

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:07.116
Come on, push.

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:11.869
Let me through.

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:27.875
- I don't believe this.
- Water's running.

01:23:28.919 --> 01:23:32.468
What the hell are they doing?
Stand back.

01:23:35.399 --> 01:23:37.549
What the hell are they up to?

01:24:01.879 --> 01:24:05.076
Marcel...

01:24:35.159 --> 01:24:41.871
You OK, Marcel?
Come on, get up. Get up.

01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:09.110
Go on! Go! Go!

01:25:13.639 --> 01:25:16.676
Julie, follow me.

01:25:23.439 --> 01:25:25.475
Be careful!

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:54.147
Not a minute too soon.

01:25:54.359 --> 01:26:00.195
Miss Plusse, you're a dragonfly in
mating season. So a toad like me...

01:26:00.399 --> 01:26:05.393
Get lost, jerk. I'm in a rush.
Let the lady by, will you?

01:26:05.599 --> 01:26:08.397
I go from one footbath
to another. Shit.

01:26:14.399 --> 01:26:16.833
I despise you. I hate you.

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:34.277
This time you're done for, clown.

01:26:37.999 --> 01:26:41.355
- Cut the bullshit.
- Right. Cut the bullshit.

01:26:41.559 --> 01:26:44.027
Now you're going to start singing.

01:26:48.559 --> 01:26:51.471
My cleaver, damn it. Hand it over.

01:26:51.679 --> 01:26:53.988
- Here, butcher.
- You, here?

01:26:54.199 --> 01:26:56.667
This is a job for the Australian.

01:27:01.319 --> 01:27:05.278
At any rate, you came
at the right time.

01:27:07.679 --> 01:27:09.158
No...

01:27:20.599 --> 01:27:24.274
- Oh, my God...
- Goddamn Troglos.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:34.867
Bastards. My Julie...

01:27:35.079 --> 01:27:38.037
It's all your fault.
You'll pay for this.

01:27:56.239 --> 01:28:00.073
I've got something
stuck in my head, right?

01:28:01.519 --> 01:28:04.158
Answer me, sausage head.

01:28:06.159 --> 01:28:12.871
You, tell me. I'm not dreaming, am I?
I've got something stuck...

01:30:54.279 --> 01:30:58.875
