WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:12.262
-Oh!

00:12.345 --> 00:13.972
Oh my God.

00:14.472 --> 00:15.807
We might be in trouble.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.436
Juan got a catch of the day.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.605
-It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

00:23.606 --> 00:27.944
It was, like, totally ruined.
Our splash was gone, our dolphin was gone.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.988
Oh my gosh.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.169
Before we start,

00:44.252 --> 00:45.795
I want to welcome back Thiago.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.713
Everything okay?

00:46.796 --> 00:48.006
Yes, Chef.

00:48.089 --> 00:51.176
-Do you still have motion? And sense?
-Yeah, yeah. They checked for that.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.343
Yep. All good.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.012
-You were lucky, my friend.
-Yes.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.473
You have to be a little bit crazy
to be a chef, right?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.392
-Just a little crazy.
-Very crazy.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.230
Obviously, one of the showpieces
is not standing up.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.485
Team Stephanie, how was your day?

01:08.568 --> 01:11.571
We came up with the concept
to create awareness

01:11.654 --> 01:14.074
about contamination
of the ocean with plastics.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.409
We faced a lot of obstacles,

01:16.493 --> 01:18.411
and we overcame a lot of obstacles.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.122
Our journey was challenge,

01:21.206 --> 01:22.707
overcome, figure it out,

01:22.791 --> 01:24.042
challenge, overcome,

01:24.125 --> 01:26.211
challenge, didn't overcome.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.380
The fact that you broke, I don't care.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.758
Because it's an exercise,
and we're gonna learn from it,

01:31.841 --> 01:35.386
and know that now,
the gravitational point is a… a must.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.057
The wave, it's actually the…
the best element on the piece.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.727
I am under the sea,
and I'm seeing the light reflection.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.270
You added texture,

01:44.354 --> 01:48.316
you added the little pearls
who are maybe little bubbles going up.

01:48.399 --> 01:51.569
It's a bold move
to try to put actual trash on a piece,

01:51.653 --> 01:53.696
and they're well executed.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.573
I like the base very much,

01:55.657 --> 01:59.077
and I know you worked almost
entirely alone on the outside of it.

01:59.828 --> 02:00.829
Thank you.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.540
Juan,
what do you think about the dolphin?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.376
Definitely wish
I could have done more detail,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.253
definitely paint it really nice, and, uh--

02:08.336 --> 02:09.754
-Shine it.
-Shine it.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.800
The dolphin,
the overall balance is pretty accurate.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.803
I was confused by your choice of color.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.180
Did you not realize
what you were doing, or…

02:20.306 --> 02:22.809
-Yeah. Yeah, I…
-We made a group decision on the color.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.311
But you know
it's not the accurate color of a dolphin.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.065
-Correct, yes.
-So why the… the light blue teal?

02:29.149 --> 02:32.443
We were being artistic,
and we wanted to use the blues

02:32.527 --> 02:35.446
that we had created.
Gray was just such a dull color.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.285
A dolphin, you knew
what it was looking like,

02:40.368 --> 02:42.120
you were going for a realistic look,

02:42.203 --> 02:46.541
and you can still play with shades of gray
and a nice white super shiny belly.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.544
I think it could've contrasted pretty well
on the piece.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.213
-What do you think, Mellisa?
-Yes, I…

02:54.048 --> 02:55.550
-It happened so fast.
-Yes, I…

02:55.633 --> 02:59.512
I agree with you. I was… Yeah,
I was surprised when the blue came out.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.639
I thought it was gonna be gray and white.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.892
But it was done.
When I saw it, it was done.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.477
So it was like, "Okay,
we're out of time anyway," so I just…

03:06.561 --> 03:09.063
I don't know
how to fix it when it's…

03:09.564 --> 03:11.024
You know, it's done!

03:12.108 --> 03:16.696
Ouch! That hurts.
Like, that was a double whammy, like,

03:16.779 --> 03:19.657
a one-two punch
that just kinda hit me right in the gut.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.745
-Amanda.
-Chef.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.247
Are you happy
with what you've created with your team?

03:26.331 --> 03:29.876
I'm extremely happy.
We wanted to bring awareness

03:29.959 --> 03:32.879
to what poachers are doing
to the elephants.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.465
Elephants are being poached
for their tusks,

03:35.548 --> 03:37.592
so we kinda represented that

03:37.675 --> 03:40.345
through our piece
with the broken tusk here,

03:40.428 --> 03:43.598
and then the glowing tusk, the shiny part.

03:44.474 --> 03:49.395
I like that you respected the exercise,
which was, bring a shiny element

03:49.479 --> 03:54.150
to highlight what was the most precious
in your design, with the pink tusk.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.985
Good job on that, Tyricia.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.948
I like that you brought to the table
some chocolate work.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.366
Fun, playful leaves,

04:01.449 --> 04:02.992
a flower on top.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.994
The texture of the elephant,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.496
it's… it's not bad,

04:07.080 --> 04:10.625
but when I look at it, I see
three different persons working on it.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.585
I don't think it's cohesive.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.964
The head is well done.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.633
Rounded, clean.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.510
-Good job on that.
-Thank you.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.429
And the body seems
like someone else did it.

04:24.764 --> 04:29.227
I would've loved to see the same kind
of work and curve on the back,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.271
on his ribs, on the belly.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.731
Um, we could've definitely,
like, defined the bottom

04:33.815 --> 04:35.400
as much as we did the top.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.237
I did love that your base of it,
it's a solid foundation,

04:39.320 --> 04:41.364
using the strength of the chocolate.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.573
Thank you, Thiago.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.618
But it was a very good approach

04:45.702 --> 04:48.454
and a good application
of the previous task.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.709
You cannot break that piece,
no matter what.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.626
Nope.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.671
-So for that, good job. Thank you, guys.
-Thank you, Chef.

04:59.007 --> 05:04.262
Team Amanda, Team Stephanie,
we have a team winner.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.308
Congratulations, Amanda's.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.105
I'm very proud of my team.

05:14.188 --> 05:17.275
At the end of the day,
we… we accomplished an elephant.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.277
We're defying gravity with that trunk.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.574
I know you needed this
to boost your self-confidence.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.993
-I hope it will help you tomorrow.
-Absolutely.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.415
I'm now going to name
today's best in class.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.336
Keep in mind
that the best in class is individual.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.339
You don't have to be
in the winning team to be best in class.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.716
It's an overall from your pastry work

05:41.799 --> 05:45.595
and your individual involvement
as a team during the chocolate exercise.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.431
And every day,
anyone can be best in class.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.809
There were two obvious candidates for me,

05:52.935 --> 05:54.145
one from each team.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.068
It's Daniel,

06:00.860 --> 06:04.155
with what he brought to the team,
stepped in mid-project,

06:04.238 --> 06:07.033
and brought a lot of beautiful work.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.201
Thank you, Chef.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.121
The second person
I would like to highlight today…

06:15.541 --> 06:18.711
is Mellisa,
for what she brought to the table

06:19.337 --> 06:21.589
and for her great work
on the pastry exercise.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.673
Thank you.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.718
Mellisa was higher on the pastry side.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.263
Daniel was a little bit under,

06:29.889 --> 06:33.601
but what Daniel brought
on the showpiece was a little bit higher

06:33.684 --> 06:37.605
because of the accommodation
he had to do, joining an existing team.

06:37.688 --> 06:38.940
He was very flexible.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.484
That shows a lot
about the quality of a chef.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.402
Thank you.

06:43.986 --> 06:47.448
My problem with this,
it's that I have a perfect tie.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.953
It is hard for me to decide,

06:52.036 --> 06:54.247
so I'm gonna ask you
a very difficult thing.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.500
I wantyou to break the tie.

06:59.836 --> 07:04.715
Please vote either for Daniel
or for Mellisa for today's best in class.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.678
Amanda?

07:08.761 --> 07:11.806
This is a tough one,
but I'm gonna have to go with Daniel.

07:12.348 --> 07:17.186
He saved the day
for Team Amanda this week.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.356
-Tyricia.
-I would vote for Daniel.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.900
I liked how he, uh, stepped in,

07:22.984 --> 07:25.736
and he was a big part
of our project getting finished,

07:25.820 --> 07:27.947
so, I mean, I vote for Daniel.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.866
Juan.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.659
Everything that Daniel showed today,

07:33.119 --> 07:37.582
just the way that he stepped in,
and he was able to create that,

07:37.665 --> 07:38.791
it's incredible.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.545
But I'd vote for Mellisa.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.427
I didn't vote for Daniel
because I didn't think that was fair

07:49.510 --> 07:53.014
for him to win, because he was actually
at the bottom on the pastry exercise.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.307
Stephanie.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.894
I know how devoted she was to my passion,

07:57.977 --> 07:59.979
so for that reason,
I'm gonna choose Mellisa.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.607
Seeing how Mellisa worked,

08:02.690 --> 08:05.693
it wasn't really a question
of who deserved that title,

08:05.776 --> 08:08.738
but it just kinda looked
like we were creating another tie.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.449
Daniel.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.952
Um, I'm gonna vote for Mellisa.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.788
Oh wow.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.833
What a gentleman.

08:20.917 --> 08:25.129
No, honestly, no, but knowing
that Mellisa was working on the base,

08:25.213 --> 08:29.759
and I see that as, like,
it's technically executed very well.

08:29.842 --> 08:30.885
-I agree with you.
-So…

08:30.968 --> 08:33.638
That is why
I'm genuinely still voting for Mellisa.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.476
Having not done so well
in the round one,

08:38.559 --> 08:41.687
Chef and I sat down, and he was like,
"Daniel, the biggest thing

08:41.771 --> 08:44.315
that you need to remember is
to stay humble."

08:44.398 --> 08:46.651
I'm not a very selfish person,
to be quite honest.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.861
So that is why
I ended up voting for Mellisa.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.114
To be, to stay on that track
that Chef is trying to push me into.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.032
Mellisa.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.913
I'm gonna vote for myself.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.502
I know my contribution to my team,

09:04.585 --> 09:07.588
and I know my pastry of that day,

09:07.672 --> 09:10.633
and between the two of us,
I'm gonna vote for me.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.178
Congratulations, Mellisa.
Today, you are the best in class.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.477
I think she shouldn't have voted
for herself. She's trying to get that 50K.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.355
She's like, "Don't care who's in my way,
I'm pushing you out."

09:24.438 --> 09:27.191
You gotta do what you gotta do.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.693
Thank you for your hard work today.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.486
-See you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.488
-Good night, Chef.
-Good night.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.448
Thank you.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.799
I thought it was gonna be a tie,
then she broke the tie, I was like, "Oh!"

09:51.882 --> 09:52.717
Yeah.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.885
I mean, it was hard for me.
I wasn't there.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.722
Obviously, if they'd have asked me
to vote, it would've been…

09:57.805 --> 09:59.890
I would've said Daniel,
because you stepped in.

09:59.974 --> 10:00.808
Yeah.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.644
You definitely have
a different glow today

10:03.728 --> 10:06.439
after your win,
your acknowledgment.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.399
I'm not blue
from all the cocoa butter today.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.279
Had to wash my hair three times last night
to get all the cocoa butter out.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.742
-How do you feel about the vote?
-Really awkward.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.585
For Mellisa, her, like…
her competitive side tends to be harsh.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.463
Sometimes it can be seen
as she's being bossy

10:30.546 --> 10:33.799
or she's being selfish.
Definitely, she's super competitive.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.053
-I know you're happy she won.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.513
She's like,
"Well, I'm happy where it went."

10:45.519 --> 10:48.230
As much as you wanna say
it's not a competition, it is.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.652
I mean, I'm sorry, it is.

10:54.320 --> 10:59.408
And so, I need to push a little bit
because I am here to win. Yeah.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.750
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.252
-Have a good look at it.
-Oh my God.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.754
Wow.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.429
There is so much detail,
you can see the little roses

11:20.513 --> 11:21.597
inside the gold.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.891
-It's amazing.
-It also looks delicious.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.060
-It looks really real.
-You can light it up.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.520
Oh, it has a real wick.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.938
I have to light it up.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.398
-Oh, a gold lighter.
-Oh.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.857
So fancy.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.782
-Heads up.
-That's so crazy.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.910
Today, it's going to be
about telling a story.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.413
I'm gonna tell you my story.

11:45.496 --> 11:49.208
During Christmas Eve, the candle lit.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.044
-Everybody's excited, waiting for Santa.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.881
Let's see what's inside.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.094
-Ooh.
-Oozy.

12:01.053 --> 12:05.266
You have a cookie cream candle
filled with oozing-out milk.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.478
And all the base is a little chocolate box

12:09.562 --> 12:12.773
that hold a variety of teeny-tiny cookies.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.069
-Look at that.
-Oh my gosh!

12:17.653 --> 12:21.323
I'm offering a new concept
of glass of milk and cookies.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.992
-Go ahead.
-Yum-yum-yum.

12:23.075 --> 12:28.873
It is a masterpiece
from the mastermind of Chef Amaury, so…

12:28.956 --> 12:29.832
It's amazing.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.791
Mm-mm.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.714
For the demonstration,

12:36.797 --> 12:40.342
I'm gonna show you one way
for making an oozing-out element.

12:41.093 --> 12:45.848
There is a lot of different additives
you can add to have the perfect ooze.

12:45.931 --> 12:50.770
It will really be up to your creativity
and discretion to use whatever you want.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.941
I see all your brains…
"What story to tell?"

12:56.025 --> 12:57.568
Make me dream, huh?

12:57.651 --> 13:00.863
A nice story, not, uh…
Not something creepy.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.948
-There goes mine.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.203
This is an oozing caramel.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.039
We're going to cook it to 107,

13:10.122 --> 13:11.582
because it's just right.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.709
You cut, and gently it's pouring out.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.462
If I go 106, it will be more runnier.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.465
If I go 109, it will almost stay in place.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.051
-Big margin of error.
-Yes, sir.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.595
Once we reach the proper temperature,

13:24.678 --> 13:27.723
I'm going to stop the cooking process
right away.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.642
I'm going to Burr mix.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.187
I'm adding my gelatin,

13:34.104 --> 13:35.314
my salt,

13:35.397 --> 13:36.607
and then my butter.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.819
And that's it.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.659
You're gonna have four and a half hours
to create a dessert telling me a story.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.828
And you must include an oozing element.

13:48.911 --> 13:54.083
As you cut through the dessert, one
of the elements must start falling slowly.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.337
You don't want something too liquid.
You don't want something too thick.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.799
You'd want something
that harmoniously makes you salivate.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.261
As you see it, and you're like,
"Ooh, yeah, that's mine," you know?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.471
-Make your mouth water.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.390
-Are you all ready?
-Yes, Chef.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.100
You may begin.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.852
-Okay.
-All right.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.148
Failure is not an option.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.694
-Go. Here we go. Yeah, here we go.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.613
-Tyricia.
-Good morning, Chef.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.490
Ooh, a story about love.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.242
-Isn't it?
-Um, yeah.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.744
-It's a story of self-love, more so.
-Okay.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.206
Just me finding
who I am and loving myself.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.709
Um, I have a lot of self-doubt, um,

14:37.251 --> 14:39.628
in life and especially in pastry.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.505
I normally put myself down.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.675
My friends and family have to tell me,
"No, you're this."

14:44.758 --> 14:47.636
It's just, like, part of my anxiety.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.433
This is just a caramel,
the one that will be oozing out?

14:52.516 --> 14:55.769
I thought the praline will be the element
oozing out of your cake.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.980
-I mean, I can. I'm planning on…
-No, no, no.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.357
-You stick to… to your plan.
-Okay.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.526
I'm not here to put doubt in your head.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.989
I think that Chef is helping me
with my confidence in what I do.

15:07.072 --> 15:11.035
Like, I've never saw
anyone like me doing this.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.621
I can't see myself in it.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.497
Once I get that confidence,

15:15.581 --> 15:20.044
then I think I'll be more into my zone
and can be the best in the class.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.972
The most important part of this
is completing something that oozes.

15:32.765 --> 15:37.645
Which I love, which I do a lot
in my desserts, which I've always done.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.605
So, I was thrilled about it.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.775
It came to my mind
one of the greatest moments I had

15:42.858 --> 15:45.736
was building this really cool
marble track with my son.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.488
I was thinking
about how do I make a track,

15:47.571 --> 15:51.158
and then I'm like,
"Let's do the marble nice, clean, shiny,

15:51.241 --> 15:52.868
the colors that the boys like."

15:52.952 --> 15:57.289
You chose a simple design,
so, it has to be perfect.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.207
Yep.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.334
I haven't won yet,
and it sucks.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.253
You know, I don't know
if it's the timeline, the time frame.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.714
I've never had a problem
with time management skills.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.508
I've also never cut my finger before.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.552
So, it's one of those things
where I need to pull back.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.600
Thick cherry compote.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.270
Pinch.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.363
-Mellisa, did you request more eggs?
-Yeah, thanks.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.993
-Are you doing a caramel too?
-Passion fruit.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.411
Ooh.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.080
-Hello, Mellisa.
-Hi.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.082
-How are you?
-Good.

16:40.165 --> 16:44.795
I've been revisiting a lot of Aesop fables
with my nephew on FaceTime.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.297
We read about the goose
and the golden egg the other day,

16:47.381 --> 16:49.800
so I'm gonna recreate, uh, the golden egg.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.343
Ah, that's awesome.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.970
It'll all be a chocolate shell

16:53.053 --> 16:55.931
that's inside, uh,
hollowed-out eggshells that I did.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.017
So then Chef gets one,

16:58.100 --> 17:01.770
he will have to peel the egg
just like you would a real egg,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.023
and then the surprise is hidden inside.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.816
So how confident do you feel

17:05.899 --> 17:09.737
in presenting an actual eggshell
to Chef to peel?

17:09.820 --> 17:10.654
I feel confident.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.573
Instead of making it
out of chocolate?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.575
Well, it is gonna be made
out of chocolate per se,

17:14.658 --> 17:17.703
'cause there'll be the chocolate shell
underneath. I think it's a great idea.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.455
-So I'm gonna go with it.
-Awesome.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.876
Scientifically speaking, the chocolate
should contract away from the eggshell,

17:23.959 --> 17:25.878
and then you're gonna be able to peel it.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.589
I really wanna swing for the fences.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.258
When you have 50 grand on the line,

17:31.341 --> 17:35.095
you have to make sure
you're presenting enough reasons to win.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.388
I'm willing to take the risk.

17:37.306 --> 17:41.226
I love she's thinking outside of the box.
I can tell you don't like it already.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.394
-I see your face.
-No, I…

17:44.354 --> 17:48.400
The prospect of getting
even a small fragment of eggshell

17:48.484 --> 17:51.278
would completely ruin
an entire experience,

17:51.361 --> 17:55.365
and I hope for your sake that
you don't get any eggshell in your mouth.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.533
Oof.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.045
Ow.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.340
-Yiy-yiy-yiy.
-Is that your oozing element?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.592
-Hm? Yeah.
-Is that your oozing element?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.260
-Take it to 105.
-Okay.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.305
The hardest part
about creating the ooze,

18:18.388 --> 18:20.766
if you cook it too little,
it's gonna be too watery,

18:20.849 --> 18:24.478
or if you cook it too long,
it's gonna be too thick and it won't ooze.

18:24.561 --> 18:28.982
So you have to get it in that little,
little window of perfection.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.110
Oh my God, I think I got it.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.071
-Doing okay?
-Yeah.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.116
I just have to do it completely different
than what I thought.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.536
I knew we were gonna see fruit centers,
we were gonna see caramel centers.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.412
I wanted that center to be different.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.539
Round two.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.501
I'm doing a liquid ganache
which I know works.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.378
You know,
you just need time to make it work.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.421
Playing with fats, and emulsifying it,

18:51.505 --> 18:53.465
and getting it to ooze, it's a challenge.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.092
And that was the risk.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.510
My ooze didn't ooze.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.428
I'm glad you know.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.640
-I'm so sad.
-What do we do to correct that?

19:01.723 --> 19:05.018
-Uh, change the fat ratio.
-Okay.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.728
Before, it was a little thick.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
-I'll leave you to it, sir.
-Thank you.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.899
-You using?
-Yeah.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.694
-Shit's gonna go everywhere.
-Good.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.821
Definitely,
one of my competitions here

19:15.904 --> 19:16.989
will be Thiago.

19:17.489 --> 19:21.451
He has a lot of good understanding
of pastry and flavors,

19:22.035 --> 19:25.330
but he tries to push so much
that that's what he's lacking.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.249
Someone is having fun.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.501
I think I made the tiniest flowers.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.670
-Might be it, yeah.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.630
What are you telling me today?
What's the story?

19:33.714 --> 19:36.884
So, there was a book
that they used to read us as a kid.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.137
-<i>The Little Prince.</i> A good one.
-<i>The Little Prince</i>.

19:40.220 --> 19:44.349
This book actually helped me
understand a little bit more of myself,

19:44.433 --> 19:46.727
during what I was going through,
the grief for my mom.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.647
So, I created the moon,
the planet that he used to live.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.274
It's quite beautiful.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.654
My mom was a kindergarten teacher.
That was a book she read to the kids.

19:58.405 --> 20:03.035
So, I wanted to do something
that will pretty much, um, honor her.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.831
Not just everything that I lost,

20:07.915 --> 20:09.875
but everything that I gained with her.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.337
Chefs, one hour to go.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.589
Heard. Thank you, Chef.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.925
We wanna see
some great pastry today, guys.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.092
Oh you will.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.012
-One hour, please.
-Don't you worry. Yes, Chef.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.061
-Stephanie?
-Yes?

20:29.144 --> 20:31.939
-Are you good on time? All good?
-I'm good, yeah.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.609
I'm assembling my, um,
insert for my coffee mug,

20:35.692 --> 20:37.110
and once that's assembled,

20:37.194 --> 20:40.447
I'm gonna roll it in white chocolate,
airbrush it in white cocoa butter.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.867
So I still have a few things to do
to finish, but I think I'm on time.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.035
Okay.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.206
I'm trying to tell the story
of my grandma and I.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.875
We'd have our coffee together
and the biscotti she'd make.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.128
Um, inside, it's gonna be
a traditional tiramisu.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.923
I'm gonna make my own mold,
um, out of acetate paper

20:58.006 --> 20:59.883
to create the cup shape.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.845
I'm pushing myself out of my comfort zone
in every single challenge I'm doing.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.723
Creating lifelike tacos,

21:06.807 --> 21:09.017
and then creating
my own chocolate espresso cups.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.186
I know I am capable of doing this.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.815
My downfall
is that I get nervous and caught up

21:14.898 --> 21:18.944
and really frazzled
when the time is clock-- Counting down.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.322
Come on.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.075
Not enough salt.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.078
There's a lot at stake,
uh, with this pastry round.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.831
Coming in,
having won the first pastry exercise,

21:30.914 --> 21:32.582
then having lostit…

21:32.666 --> 21:36.169
Chef said it really well. He was like,
"Daniel, take a few steps back,

21:36.253 --> 21:38.964
hone in on flavor,
hone in on technique on pastry."

21:39.047 --> 21:40.215
I got this, no worries.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.678
Now it is about winning pastry exercise,
doing well, and being on the top.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.433
-Thirty minutes, chefs.
-Thank you, Chef.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.143
-Thank you.
-Heard.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.353
-Heard. Thank you.
-You are welcome.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.567
Come on, come on, come on.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.200
God jam it. Fingerprints.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.786
There are fingerprints
just all over the place.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.289
So I literally just went with it.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.961
-How are we doing, Thiago?
-I got it in the freezer a little late.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.548
I think I listened for the first time
to keeping it simple with the marble.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.009
Only ambitious part
was getting the center ooze.

22:24.092 --> 22:27.763
And I feel like nothing is,
you know, working out the way I planned.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.517
Oh,
how I wish I had liquid nitrogen.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.228
Nice.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.190
I don't know
if my stuff will be ready.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.446
Don't worry, don't worry.
We got this, we got this. Don't worry.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.198
We got this. There you go.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.703
I think, because it's just
so much emotion in this,

22:51.787 --> 22:54.956
because I know where I came from
in this whole journey I've been on,

22:55.040 --> 22:57.459
I feel like
if I don't get this dessert done,

22:58.085 --> 23:00.295
then I completely failed my family.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.381
That's how I felt
in that moment.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.926
Succeed.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.262
-One minute.
-Ready.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.222
One minute.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.105
Oh…

23:19.189 --> 23:20.732
Plate, Thiago.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.945
-Do you want help putting it on the plate?
-I'm all right.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.197
Let's go, Thiago.

23:28.782 --> 23:32.911
-Don't fall over.
-Three, two, one.

23:32.994 --> 23:33.829
Done.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.583
-Thank you, chefs.
-Thank you, Chef.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.588
Chefs, can you please
bring your desserts forward.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.019
Daniel.

23:58.103 --> 24:01.231
-Yes, Chef.
-Bring me this ice-cream cone.

24:02.023 --> 24:05.026
It's a retake
on the first thing I ever baked.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.071
Uh, it was for my brother's birthday,
and I saw something online,

24:08.155 --> 24:12.159
and it was, like, trending
where you baked cupcakes in cake cones.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.579
And, as I was baking, I was so afraid
that I was gonna burn the cupcakes,

24:15.662 --> 24:20.125
and I pulled them out so early
that the batter was raw.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.253
But, you know, at the end of the day,
my family was like, "Oh, it's still good…"

24:23.336 --> 24:24.921
-Yeah, they lied.
-Yeah, I know.

24:25.005 --> 24:29.968
But to be quite honest, I think everyone
here remembers the first thing they baked,

24:30.051 --> 24:33.054
and, like, wow, had I not done that,
I may not be here right now.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.891
-Is it gonna ooze, sir?
-I hope so, Chef.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.734
So we are forming
the perfect ooze.

24:45.817 --> 24:50.197
That's… That's what I'm expecting.
A very slow drip of a soft element

24:50.280 --> 24:52.449
and you're like, "Ooh, yeah. I want to…"

24:52.532 --> 24:54.826
-You know? "I want to spoon that."

24:55.327 --> 24:57.662
I made peanut butter
with a chocolate mousse.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.499
Uh, chocolate cake,
chocolate anglaise on the top.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.834
And then it is piped with vanilla <i>crémeux</i>.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.796
-What's this on top?
-The vanilla <i>crémeux</i>.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.590
You forgot the sugar in it.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.009
-Try it. It's pure cream.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.427
Yeah.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.763
I get it once,
I don't want to eat it again.

25:15.847 --> 25:21.603
It's weird with you because you already
got some of the harder parts of our job,

25:21.686 --> 25:23.021
which is the precision,

25:23.104 --> 25:24.564
the visual of it,

25:24.648 --> 25:26.399
but then you lack on the…

25:26.483 --> 25:28.902
What… what is the fundamental, the base.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.570
The taste, Daniel.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.863
Taste and texture.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.909
Forgetting sugar in something can happen.
It's a bummer it happened to you today.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.121
Stephanie, let me travel to Italy?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.164
-Yes.
-Isn't it?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.583
I like that you did
a little biscotti on the top.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.212
They look nice, and, uh…
and the shape is exactly this.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.047
Is it going to ooze, I hope?

25:49.130 --> 25:51.550
Yeah, it should ooze. Hopefully. Um…

26:08.608 --> 26:09.609
Ah!

26:11.778 --> 26:12.612
Oh gosh.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.740
-Stephanie…

26:18.034 --> 26:18.868
Oh my God.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.621
After I saw Chef cut
my acetate paper,

26:21.705 --> 26:25.375
I literally just wanted
to go down and hide. I was done.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.669
I was just like,
"Send me home right now, Chef."

26:29.588 --> 26:31.590
It was like finding a hair
in your food

26:31.673 --> 26:35.051
and, like, wanting to return it
and get all your money back,

26:35.135 --> 26:37.053
but, like, ten times worse than that!

26:40.223 --> 26:42.601
-It's very good. It's very good.
-Thank you.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.728
You made honor to your grandma.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.022
-I feel really bad.
-We're all learning here.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.608
Probably why it didn't airbrush
so well, and the fingerprints.

26:51.901 --> 26:55.238
She's like, "It doesn't apply,"
you know? Like, just…

26:55.322 --> 26:56.323
-Oh my God.
-Yeah.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.658
Working on plastic is different
than what you…

26:58.742 --> 27:01.161
You two should talk, you know?

27:01.244 --> 27:03.580
Exchange visual and recipe,

27:03.663 --> 27:05.665
because your design

27:05.749 --> 27:08.126
but this type of quality
of ingredient and component,

27:08.209 --> 27:10.378
and it's… it's exactly what I want.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.424
-We're making something when we're done.
-Yeah, let's go do that.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.426
-Tyricia.
-Oh, great.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.929
The glaze is well done.
It's shiny.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.725
-Should I just split the heart open?
-Yes, Chef. Literally.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.103
All right. Let's try this.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.442
Is it oozing? It's not oozing.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.112
Well, I don't have the… the ooze.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.989
I cooked it to, uh, 105.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.534
It… It is oozing out. It is. No?

27:41.618 --> 27:45.205
Just give it a chance.
It's slow like me, okay?

27:45.288 --> 27:47.082
So, it is, yeah.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.709
-It is a gentle ooze, but it is oozing.
-Okay.

27:51.127 --> 27:56.508
It's a pecan financier, pecan caramel,
coffee mousse, and then a whipped cream.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.052
I'm really pleased by the taste.
And the texture.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.470
Oh.

28:00.553 --> 28:03.598
Uh, the caramel is good.
The crunch is here.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.142
Like, for me, it's a…
it's a very good dessert.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.144
-Yes!
-So, yes.

28:09.562 --> 28:10.730
Cedrick.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.777
I lived in Germany
for a short period of time,

28:15.860 --> 28:18.488
and we had two huge cherry trees
in front of our apartment.

28:18.571 --> 28:21.449
So, there is of course
the chocolate on the outside

28:21.533 --> 28:23.410
to represent the cherry tree itself.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.496
I… I like the visual.
I also understand this is a bark.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.958
So you are piquing my interest.
I'm just gonna go.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.626
-Yes.
-But it better ooze, huh?

28:31.710 --> 28:32.961
Does it ooze?

28:36.005 --> 28:39.926
It's quite nice. But it's not oozing.
I'm gonna… I'm gonna taste it.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.762
The bottom is just a…
a very lightly spiced s<i>ablé,</i>

28:42.846 --> 28:44.305
and the cherry mousse.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.183
And then the light,
almost white, is the honey <i>crémeux</i>.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.394
It has a very nice cherry flavor.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.605
Texture-wise, there's a little bit of work
and improvement to be made.

28:52.689 --> 28:56.025
The cherry mousse is very similar
to what you've done before with the apple.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.902
It tends to be a little bit grainy.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.864
I'm biting into things,
like almost chewing on it.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.741
Maybe it's… You take too much risk.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.327
Amanda.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.790
When I was in the Army,
I was in the Ordnance Corps,

29:11.291 --> 29:14.210
and this is that symbol
for the Ordnance Corps.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.337
At every military ball,

29:16.421 --> 29:18.381
there is a missing man table,

29:18.465 --> 29:22.594
and on that table is one single red rose
that represents the blood

29:22.677 --> 29:27.098
that is shed by soldiers, um,
protecting our freedom.

29:27.182 --> 29:31.728
It also symbolizes those family members
waiting at home for them to come home.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.233
-It's okay. Get it out.

29:37.817 --> 29:41.529
So, inside my dessert
you'll find a raspberry mousse,

29:41.613 --> 29:44.115
a rose cream, a sponge cake,

29:44.199 --> 29:48.036
and the raspberry coulis
represents that blood that's shed.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.541
I love… I love the story.
Should I… Should I fear for my life?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.210
-No.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.338
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.093
The perfect ooze-out element

30:04.177 --> 30:06.095
that served exactly
the purpose you wanted,

30:06.179 --> 30:08.556
but the amount of chocolate…

30:08.640 --> 30:10.433
-Oh, yeah. It's super thick. Yeah.
-Oof.

30:10.517 --> 30:14.437
-This for me is unacceptable. It's…
-Well, see, what happened was…

30:14.521 --> 30:17.065
-Okay. All right. Let's get to the story.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.193
When I was dipping, I tried
to pull it out, and it fell right in.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.110
Okay.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.905
It's a very good first try.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.865
-Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.826
All right, Mellisa.

30:29.828 --> 30:34.874
So, um, I chose
one of my, uh, favorite Aesop fables,

30:34.958 --> 30:37.418
which is about the goose
that laid the golden egg.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.798
I'm really hoping that you'll be able
to crack and shell the egg.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.217
It's a real do-or-die situation, isn't it?

30:44.300 --> 30:46.386
-Yeah.
-So let's… let's have fun.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.096
And the stand is just chocolate?

30:48.179 --> 30:49.848
No,
the little legs are chocolate,

30:49.931 --> 30:53.268
but then the seat part for the egg
has cookies that I ground up,

30:53.351 --> 30:55.353
some orange zest,
and salt in the milk chocolate.

30:55.436 --> 30:58.022
It's really glued. You know
how to glue chocolate. So, that's good.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.357
Gonna do it with the stand.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.110
-I'm scared if I… I'm gonna crack it.
-Yes, Chef. Yeah.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.618
Ah. Yeah, that's the problem.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.997
-I'm getting shell in here.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.543
So, it's oozing out.

31:18.626 --> 31:21.004
It could've been amazing
if it would have worked.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.589
I'm very conflicted.

31:22.672 --> 31:26.467
You are challenging yourself
on things extremely ambitious.

31:26.551 --> 31:32.181
I'm always the one giving you
the advice of thinking outside of the box.

31:32.265 --> 31:35.685
Today it won't pay off,
but maybe tomorrow it will.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.689
Then I'll go on the moon.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.984
You… You did quite a nice chocolatier job,

31:43.067 --> 31:44.485
the little nice flower.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.488
One thing I've noticed,
I can see the fingerprints.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.158
I saw the fingerprints
and I realized that,

31:50.241 --> 31:51.951
then I started
putting fingerprints all over.

31:52.035 --> 31:52.869
Okay.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.124
You turned it towards an advantage
because it looks very genuine.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.877
As a professional I just know
you didn't mean to do that at first.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.087
-Correct.
-Is it going to ooze?

32:03.671 --> 32:05.423
-Yes.
-All right.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.971
-It's not oozing?
-No.

32:15.308 --> 32:20.772
So, we have a mascarpone mousse,
then a vanilla with strawberry syrup cake,

32:20.855 --> 32:24.108
a lemon <i>crémeux,</i>
a strawberry cereal crunch.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.030
Yeah, it's very good.
And it's technically well-made.

32:29.113 --> 32:32.283
I mean, everything is straight,
the chocolate is very thin,

32:32.367 --> 32:33.868
the components look soft.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.286
It… It's a good dessert.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.124
Please, uh, Thiago.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.710


32:42.794 --> 32:45.338
I lost 45 minutes
with the center,

32:45.838 --> 32:49.926
so I made a center, froze it,
when I checked it, it didn't ooze.

32:50.009 --> 32:52.762
And I know a big part of the challenge
is getting to ooze.

32:52.845 --> 32:55.932
So I had to change things up,
but I know it's gonna ooze for sure.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.726
I like the blue. If you served me this,
you tell me the story,

32:58.810 --> 33:00.853
I'm like, "Okay,
that's a marble, fair enough."

33:03.064 --> 33:05.108
Ooh.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.903
Well, it is oozing,
I'd almost consider it as, like, a sauce.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.823
For me, oozing out
is on the slightly thicker side.

33:12.448 --> 33:15.159
-Let's see how it tastes.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.871
So, I have the liquid hazelnut
milk chocolate ganache,

33:18.955 --> 33:21.457
made diplomat cream
out of hazelnut, I have a financier,

33:21.541 --> 33:24.293
and there's milk chocolate
hazelnut crispies in the middle.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.505
I don't know,
the elements for me did not blend right.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.383
-Texture doesn't please me as well.
-Okay.

33:30.466 --> 33:35.054
Chocolate is a beautiful
and treacherous mistress sometimes.

33:37.390 --> 33:40.560
Today's leader,
starting from second place…

33:44.647 --> 33:45.857
Tyricia.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.902
-Oh my God.
-I'm proud of you, Tyricia.

33:50.778 --> 33:55.408
I'm trying to show him that I've got it.
I can do this stuff.

34:00.621 --> 34:03.499
All right. And now
the one that scored the most.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.335
The only one where the presentation
was so perfect,

34:06.419 --> 34:08.796
I could easily finding myself selling it.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.135
Juan.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.222
It's missing out the oozing element,

34:18.306 --> 34:21.392
but as far as, like,
the… the texture, the flavor,

34:21.476 --> 34:24.312
it was quite accurate
to what I'm expecting into a dessert.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.481
Definitely not thinking
that I was going to be on top.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.982
I was really, really surprised.

34:28.066 --> 34:33.112
And literally right away I was just,
like, how proud my mom is right now.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.322
Thank you.

34:34.947 --> 34:37.492
So now,
the two people on the bottom of the class

34:37.575 --> 34:38.993
on the pastry exercise.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.536
-Mellisa.

34:43.372 --> 34:47.085
And Thiago. I don't want this
to bring down your spirit

34:47.168 --> 34:50.171
because I don't want you
to stop risking things,

34:50.254 --> 34:52.799
uh, because it's also part
of what we're here for.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.301
Too much ooze I guess is a bad thing.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.845
I mean, who knew?
And I'm at the bottom of the barrel.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.431
But the dessert that didn't ooze
got the highest score.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.772
I forgot
to take the paper off.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.442
You get so mad at yourself
because you're like,

35:11.526 --> 35:12.985
"Ah, what am I thinkin'?"

35:13.653 --> 35:16.114
-And that's all it is.
-Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

35:16.197 --> 35:20.034
-I was thinking… so many things.
-Mm-hmm.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.246
I'm getting wrapped up
in this chocolate fairy tale land,

35:23.329 --> 35:26.833
and trying to use as much
chocolate technique as I can,

35:26.916 --> 35:29.127
and instead I'm really just kind of

35:30.253 --> 35:32.672
burying myself in failures
at the moment.

35:33.297 --> 35:37.301
And I know… I know I'm better than that.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.096
-Well, that was rough.
-Bottom two.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.472
Bottom two.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.809
With great risk comes high reward
or high failure, I guess.

35:44.892 --> 35:48.437
I mean, but I should be crushing these.
Like, you and I, you know…

35:48.521 --> 35:50.857
-The amount of experience combined.
-Yeah, I'm just shocked.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.441
I mean, I… I don't know.

35:53.025 --> 35:55.570
I don't wanna take anything away
from Juan, he did a lot of work,

35:55.653 --> 35:57.780
but he didn't respect the technique.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.908
I think we should find out why…
why Juan's dessert got number one.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.162
I really want to taste it.
Let's see if, um, he's just teacher's pet

36:04.245 --> 36:07.915
or if Chef really just thinks
that he makes good desserts.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.295
Yeah, you can eat a whole bowl of that.

36:12.378 --> 36:15.131
-Juan is so good at what he does.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.049
I think Juan's best in class.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.344
I think Juan's teacher's pet
because he's best in class all the time.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.222
-Juan, yours was delicious.
-Oh, thank you.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.223
We saved you mine.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.893
So whatchy'all thought?

36:26.976 --> 36:30.479
I need to understand
how you go from, "It must ooze"

36:30.563 --> 36:33.482
to, like, "It didn't ooze,
congrats, you have the highest score."

36:34.734 --> 36:36.986
I understand
why they can get, like, salty,

36:37.069 --> 36:40.656
I mean, but the way
that my dessert of the moon was executed,

36:40.740 --> 36:43.868
it was way better
than other things that were there.

36:43.951 --> 36:45.453
Nothing to what you did,

36:45.536 --> 36:48.372
like, it's beautiful tasting,
but it didn't ooze.

36:49.081 --> 36:51.209
We're all here to learn.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.420
Some are here to win more than learn.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.339
Juan has won twice,

36:56.422 --> 36:59.592
so he has a bullseye on his back.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.844
Like,
that's, like, I don't get it.

37:02.845 --> 37:07.266
People think that when you're doing good
they kinda, like, find ways to, like,

37:08.142 --> 37:10.102
like attack you, bring you even down.

37:10.186 --> 37:15.066
I am taking this home, and I'm not letting
any one of them to take that away from me.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.777
Next time you're gonna be scrolling
Amaury's web page

37:17.860 --> 37:19.695
and I'm gonna be there, my face.

37:20.696 --> 37:22.657
Chef Juan.
