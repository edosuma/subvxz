01:04.617 --> 01:09.538
<i>Sometimes, when I get really high,
I kind of think I'm psychic.</i>

01:12.917 --> 01:16.502
<i>When Nate Jacobs was 11 years old,</i>

01:16.504 --> 01:19.630
<i>he found his dad's porn collection.</i>

01:19.632 --> 01:22.174
<i>His dad, Cal, was obsessive.</i>

01:22.176 --> 01:25.469
<i>His mom always said
that's who he got it from.</i>

01:25.471 --> 01:27.888
<i>Then he quickly realized
that the colored cases</i>

01:27.890 --> 01:30.265
<i>and placement were no accident.</i>

01:30.267 --> 01:36.522
<i>It was an elaborate code,
that no one fucked with his shit.</i>

01:36.524 --> 01:39.858
<i>I have a very pretty dick.
Do you want to see it?</i>

01:39.860 --> 01:43.404
<i>What do you like to be called?
Mister? Master?</i>

01:43.406 --> 01:48.993
- <i>Daddy?</i>
- <i>For you? You can call me "Daddy."</i>

01:48.995 --> 01:53.791
<i>Open wider. Wider.
More like that.</i>

01:55.793 --> 01:57.668
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- <i>Good?</i>

01:57.670 --> 01:59.378
<i>Yes, Daddy. I'll be good.</i>

01:59.380 --> 02:01.380
<i>Every video was basically the same.</i>

02:01.382 --> 02:04.008
<i>Oh, you are all woman, aren't you?</i>

02:04.010 --> 02:06.051
- <i>Mostly.</i>
- <i>Mostly.</i>

02:06.053 --> 02:08.220
<i>They'd drink, make small talk...</i>

02:08.222 --> 02:11.726
<i>Oh, don't make me come.
I... I want to wait for that.</i>

02:13.060 --> 02:15.102
<i>...and then his dad would
fuck the shit out of some...</i>

02:15.104 --> 02:18.566
<i>Fucking whore.
Fucking slut.</i>

02:56.187 --> 02:58.564
I want to talk to you.

03:04.111 --> 03:06.572
You're a strong man, Nathaniel.

03:08.407 --> 03:11.327
I knew it from the moment
you were born.

03:13.037 --> 03:16.666
You have an... iron will...

03:17.958 --> 03:20.834
...drive, determination.

03:20.836 --> 03:23.879
I've always admired that in you.

03:23.881 --> 03:26.467
Because some day, it will
lead you to greatness.

03:33.265 --> 03:37.810
But no one in this world
will ever root for you.

03:37.812 --> 03:41.605
They'll see what I see
and they'll despise you for it.

03:41.607 --> 03:45.734
Sometimes you'll know,
and sometimes you won't.

03:45.736 --> 03:49.240
But the farther you go,
the sharper their blade.

03:50.408 --> 03:53.285
Just don't ever
give them an opening.

04:01.085 --> 04:06.171
<i>By 12, he had adopted a rigid
diet and workout schedule.</i>

04:06.173 --> 04:11.804
<i>Within a year, his body fat
dropped from 23% to 6%.</i>

04:35.328 --> 04:37.911
Ready? All right!

04:37.913 --> 04:41.206
<i>He joined the football team
as a freshman and quickly excelled.</i>

04:41.208 --> 04:45.252
Red... Red, 32, hut!

04:45.254 --> 04:47.129
<i>By the year's end,</i>

04:47.131 --> 04:50.799
<i>he was not only the starting
quarterback, but the team captain.</i>

04:50.801 --> 04:52.843
Keep it together, Nate.
Stay focused.

04:52.845 --> 04:55.181
All right, let's fucking go!

05:08.194 --> 05:11.111
<i>He loved the crowds,</i>

05:11.113 --> 05:15.159
<i>the cheers, the feeling of winning.</i>

05:18.162 --> 05:21.455
<i>But he hated being
in the locker room.</i>

05:21.457 --> 05:25.586
<i>He hated how casual how his teammates
were about being naked...</i>

05:27.880 --> 05:31.256
<i>...how they'd talk to him
with their dicks hanging out.</i>

05:31.258 --> 05:34.385
<i>He made a concerted effort
to always maintain eye contact</i>

05:34.387 --> 05:36.220
<i>during these exchanges.</i>

05:36.222 --> 05:37.805
<i>Every now and then, he'd forget,</i>

05:37.807 --> 05:39.975
<i>and accidentally catch
a glimpse of someone's penis.</i>

05:56.534 --> 05:59.284
<i>His older brother Aaron
was a fuck-up.</i>

05:59.286 --> 06:02.663
<i>He could tell his dad didn't like Aaron,
didn't think he had guts or brains</i>

06:02.665 --> 06:05.376
<i>or half a fucking clue
and Nate agreed.</i>

06:07.044 --> 06:11.338
<i>He didn't talk to his dad that much,
but they didn't need to.</i>

06:11.340 --> 06:13.841
<i>They had a good relationship.</i>

06:13.843 --> 06:17.845
<i>He didn't like his mother either.
She was weak, and a pushover.</i>

06:17.847 --> 06:20.639
<i>Plus, she didn't
take care of herself.</i>

06:20.641 --> 06:22.474
<i>He made a long mental checklist</i>

06:22.476 --> 06:25.477
<i>of the things he liked
and disliked about women.</i>

06:25.479 --> 06:28.772
<i>He liked tennis skirts
and jean cut-offs,</i>

06:28.774 --> 06:31.150
<i>but not the kind so short
you could see the pockets.</i>

06:31.152 --> 06:33.652
<i>He liked ballet flats and heels.</i>

06:33.654 --> 06:35.612
<i>He hated sneakers and dress shoes.</i>

06:35.614 --> 06:39.366
<i>But was fine with sandals as long as
they were worn with a fresh pedicure.</i>

06:39.368 --> 06:42.077
<i>He liked thigh gaps, hated cankles.</i>

06:42.079 --> 06:45.873
<i>He liked tan lines, long necks,
slender shoulders.</i>

06:45.875 --> 06:49.752
<i>He liked good posture
and fruit-scented body mist.</i>

06:49.754 --> 06:52.880
<i>He liked full lips, and small noses.</i>

06:52.882 --> 06:55.007
<i>He liked chokers, but the lacy ones</i>

06:55.009 --> 06:57.676
<i>with flower cutouts
or delicate patterns.</i>

06:57.678 --> 07:02.723
<i>He hated girls who sat like boys,
talked like boys, acted like boys.</i>

07:02.725 --> 07:07.813
<i>But there was nothing on planet Earth
he hated more than body hair.</i>

07:09.523 --> 07:13.233
<i>That's one of the first things
he noticed about Maddy.</i>

07:13.235 --> 07:14.987
<i>She was basically hairless.</i>

07:19.408 --> 07:22.368
<i>He'd walk her home
from school every day.</i>

07:22.370 --> 07:26.330
<i>Made him feel good to know
that he was there to protect her.</i>

07:26.332 --> 07:29.583
<i>He knew the world was full of
men who wanted to hurt Maddy.</i>

07:29.585 --> 07:34.213
<i>Men who hang out the windows of their
cars and scream obscenities at her.</i>

07:34.215 --> 07:37.508
<i>College guys who wouldn't
think twice about drugging her.</i>

07:37.510 --> 07:41.095
<i>Lonely guys who'd spot her
at a mall.</i>

07:41.097 --> 07:46.266
<i>Men who'd rape her, torture her,
sell her into sexual slavery.</i>

07:46.268 --> 07:48.854
<i>He didn't even
like to think about it.</i>

07:50.439 --> 07:55.361
<i>He did, however, like to thing about
the things he'd do to protect her.</i>

07:58.072 --> 08:01.115
If anyone ever tried to
hurt you, I'd kill them.

08:01.117 --> 08:04.036
You're, like, the sweetest guy ever.

08:07.123 --> 08:09.665
<i>He also liked
that Maddy was a virgin,</i>

08:09.667 --> 08:12.793
<i>that no guy had ever
put his penis in her.</i>

08:12.795 --> 08:16.797
- You're a virgin?
- Yeah.

08:16.799 --> 08:20.092
- Like, fully?
- Yeah.

08:20.094 --> 08:21.846
What about like...

08:23.014 --> 08:27.184
- Have you ever been fingered?
- Only my own.

08:30.604 --> 08:34.982
<i>He sometimes imagined marrying
Maddy and starting a family.</i>

08:34.984 --> 08:37.443
<i>He knew he didn't want boys, though.</i>

08:37.445 --> 08:40.072
<i>But he also didn't like
the idea of having girls.</i>

08:41.741 --> 08:44.950
<i>Plus, Maddy could be a real bitch.</i>

08:44.952 --> 08:49.204
<i>Like that night at McKay's party,
something just flipped.</i>

08:49.206 --> 08:52.543
<i>And he knew he had anger issues,
but, I mean, so did every guy.</i>

08:55.880 --> 09:00.007
<i>It's not like that was anything in
his life he could trace it back to.</i>

09:00.009 --> 09:04.513
<i>It was just... who he was,
and who he'd always be.</i>

09:14.857 --> 09:16.982
What are you doing?

09:16.984 --> 09:20.780
Nothing, I just came to...
came to say goodnight.

09:25.576 --> 09:29.872
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:02.279 --> 10:06.534
<i>It was the first day of school,
and my heart was racing.</i>

10:11.956 --> 10:16.166
<i>I made a new best friend and for the
first time since getting out of rehab,</i>

10:16.168 --> 10:19.338
<i>I was feeling good about the world.</i>

10:20.715 --> 10:23.050
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

10:24.218 --> 10:29.096
- What?
- Wanna get high?

10:29.098 --> 10:33.267
- What is it?
- No idea.

10:33.269 --> 10:37.481
- Didn't you just get out of rehab?
- Yeah.

10:38.816 --> 10:42.192
- Should I be concerned?
- Maybe.

10:42.194 --> 10:47.450
- I feel like this isn't a good idea.
- I kinda disagree.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.206
Rue.

11:03.299 --> 11:06.594
Do you feel anything?

11:11.640 --> 11:15.936
Do you feel anything?

11:17.313 --> 11:20.731
Rue, what's wrong?

11:20.733 --> 11:23.986
Just so happy.

11:31.202 --> 11:33.329
<i>I know you're
not allowed to say it...</i>

11:36.999 --> 11:39.335
<i>...but drugs are kind of cool.</i>

11:42.880 --> 11:46.258
<i>I mean, they're cool
before they wreck your skin...</i>

11:47.468 --> 11:49.635
<i>...and your life...</i>

11:49.637 --> 11:52.346
Can you grab me a towel?

11:52.348 --> 11:54.640
<i>...and your family.</i>

11:54.642 --> 11:58.143
Gia, I need you to grab me a towel.

11:58.145 --> 12:00.813
I found her down.
I gave her one dose of Narcan...

12:00.815 --> 12:03.859
<i>That's when they get uncool.</i>

12:08.239 --> 12:11.325
<i>It's actually a very
narrow window of cool.</i>

12:20.626 --> 12:23.168
I'll wait with you
until your mother comes home.

12:23.170 --> 12:25.212
You want to watch some TV?

12:25.214 --> 12:29.258
<i>And once you pass through
that window of cool...</i>

12:29.260 --> 12:34.348
This is embarrassing.
I feel like everyone knows.

12:35.599 --> 12:40.185
Rue, I don't want to turn
this into a competition,

12:40.187 --> 12:45.190
but, like, I win.
For, like, a multitude of reasons.

12:45.192 --> 12:47.943
I just... I don't want to deal with
all the fucking questions.

12:47.945 --> 12:50.281
I still win.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.871
Wait, you're alive?

12:58.873 --> 13:01.584
Like, what the fuck?

13:03.169 --> 13:06.086
Oh, shit, that's the girl who tried
to commit suicide at McKay's.

13:06.088 --> 13:08.213
- Wait, what?
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

13:08.215 --> 13:11.300
You guys both was fuckin'.

13:11.302 --> 13:13.721
Why does everybody
think we fucked?

13:16.182 --> 13:18.682
<i>Now Maddy knew
she had an optics issue,</i>

13:18.684 --> 13:21.685
<i>along with a mountain
of evidence against her.</i>

13:21.687 --> 13:24.857
<i>So, last night,
while texting with Nate...</i>

13:26.859 --> 13:29.028
<i>...Maddy had an idea.</i>

13:36.869 --> 13:41.372
- Alcohol is not good for me.
- So you did fuck him.

13:41.374 --> 13:45.042
- Honestly, I think I blacked out.
- For real?

13:45.044 --> 13:47.086
Maddy!

13:47.088 --> 13:50.047
- Hey, you.
- Oh, look! It's our new sexpert!

13:50.049 --> 13:52.841
- Congratulations, bitch!
- Welcome to the club!

13:52.843 --> 13:55.260
<i>Now, when Kat told BB
she lost her virginity</i>

13:55.262 --> 13:58.180
<i>to some dude whose name
she didn't remember, she knew</i>

13:58.182 --> 14:02.017
<i>she'll tell Maddy and Cassie, and
the rest of the fucking planet Earth.</i>

14:02.019 --> 14:04.353
<i>But that was kind of the point.</i>

14:04.355 --> 14:07.817
<i>She was just relived
that it was no longer a thing.</i>

14:24.834 --> 14:28.627
Hey, I'm Ethan.

14:28.629 --> 14:32.216
- Please don't be a mass shooter.
- What?

14:33.426 --> 14:36.510
Sorry, it's just, like, the
first thing that came to mind.

14:36.512 --> 14:41.181
Oh, my God.
Am I giving off shooter vibes?

14:41.183 --> 14:42.808
- Yeah.
- Really?

14:42.810 --> 14:45.477
- Eh, you know.
- Shit.

14:45.479 --> 14:49.314
Look, I don't know. What's
your Reddit username?

14:49.316 --> 14:51.694
Um, it's IncelUprising.

14:54.030 --> 14:56.949
I'm joking. A joke.

15:01.329 --> 15:04.955
- I'm Kat.
- Uh, I'm Ethan.

15:04.957 --> 15:07.541
Yeah, you said that.

15:07.543 --> 15:12.421
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Welcome to Biology 301.

15:12.423 --> 15:15.883
So, let's start with
a little improvisation.

15:15.885 --> 15:17.718
I'd like each of you to get up

15:17.720 --> 15:21.057
and tell us a five-minute story
about your summer.

15:22.350 --> 15:25.768
Looks like we have
our first volunteer: Rue.

15:25.770 --> 15:27.561
Please don't do this to me.

15:27.563 --> 15:31.025
Come on, everyone. Let's give
her a little encouragement.

15:54.757 --> 15:56.298
A memory?

15:56.300 --> 15:59.595
Anything that had
an impact on you this summer.

16:02.932 --> 16:06.227
I don't... I don't...
I can't think of...

16:08.688 --> 16:13.693
Just... relax your body.
Release the tension.

16:15.111 --> 16:18.278
And just breathe.

16:18.280 --> 16:22.284
We recommend taking her directly
to the rehabilitation center.

16:28.374 --> 16:32.712
- So this... this summer?
- Yes.

16:53.983 --> 16:56.861
Let's go.

17:00.990 --> 17:06.327
I'm having trouble, like, remembering
something, you know.

17:06.329 --> 17:10.289
Just tell us a specific memory.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.915
Uh, okay. Uh...

17:12.917 --> 17:16.627
I was, um, with my mom,
and my, uh, my little sister,

17:16.630 --> 17:20.175
and we were, uh,
listening to this... this song.

17:36.025 --> 17:38.444
I know you know this song.

18:35.710 --> 18:39.253
Are you doing drugs in my house?
Are you doing drugs in my house?

18:39.255 --> 18:41.132
What are you doing?

18:45.636 --> 18:47.886
I'm not joking!

18:47.888 --> 18:50.347
I need to...
I need to go!

18:50.349 --> 18:53.142
- Dad's so fucking proud, Mom.
- Oh, really?

18:53.144 --> 18:56.270
Dad's so fucking proud.

18:56.272 --> 18:57.896
Get off of me!

18:57.898 --> 18:59.773
- I don't give...
- Get off of me!

18:59.775 --> 19:04.155
Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up and
let me out of this fucking house.

20:07.885 --> 20:11.305
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't think of anything, so...

20:13.891 --> 20:15.976
Just...

20:17.895 --> 20:21.814
I'm, uh... I'm done. I can't.

20:21.816 --> 20:24.525
- Do I have to do this?
- She's a mess, dude.

20:24.527 --> 20:29.073
- Honestly, I bet it's brain damage.
- You're being fucking rude.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.020
Fuck.

21:03.983 --> 21:06.944
Rue, it's me.

21:08.863 --> 21:13.699
- Are you okay?
- You are so fucking stupid, Lexi.

21:13.701 --> 21:15.784
- Why?
- 'Cause I already flushed everything

21:15.786 --> 21:17.369
down the fucking toilet.

21:17.371 --> 21:18.912
Well, I just came to check on you.

21:18.914 --> 21:22.875
I don't want you to fucking check on me,
whether I'm fine or I'm not fine.

21:22.877 --> 21:26.211
What difference are you going to make?
Are you going to give me a life advice?

21:26.213 --> 21:30.299
- You gonna fucking help me?
- Well, you're one of my best friends.

21:30.301 --> 21:33.969
Give me a fucking break. 'Cause we
went to fucking pre-school together?

21:33.971 --> 21:36.807
That does not make us
best fucking friends.

21:38.142 --> 21:40.559
You say all this,
but what happens in three days

21:40.561 --> 21:44.313
when you knock on my door asking
me to piss in some Tylenol bottle?

21:44.315 --> 21:46.190
What, you're gonna say the opposite?

21:46.192 --> 21:49.193
How we've known each other since
pre-school and we're best friends?

21:49.195 --> 21:52.529
It's like you have
a split personality disorder.

21:52.531 --> 21:55.201
Sorry if I miss the old you.

22:01.916 --> 22:07.546
I slept like shit, too.
Yeah, I miss you.

23:19.243 --> 23:24.121
- My name is Ali, and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Ali.

23:24.123 --> 23:26.415
Actually, an addict
is a nice word for it.

23:26.417 --> 23:29.793
I was a stone-cold crackhead.

23:29.795 --> 23:34.173
I was also a firefighter, so I thought,
the two might cancel each other out.

23:34.175 --> 23:38.721
As long as I saved lives, I was well
within my right to destroy my own.

23:40.264 --> 23:43.349
The problem was, I was...

23:43.351 --> 23:47.146
I was also a father,
to two young girls.

23:48.647 --> 23:52.107
My girls live in Texas.

23:52.109 --> 23:57.782
I speak to them whenever I can.
Drugs can take away a lot.

24:00.117 --> 24:03.496
<i>The first time
I tried Oxycontin, I was 13.</i>

24:05.539 --> 24:07.625
What do these feel like?

24:10.544 --> 24:13.047
They're the absolute worst.

24:15.049 --> 24:17.299
<i>I used to take care
of my dad after school</i>

24:17.301 --> 24:20.721
<i>had to take a second
job to cover the medical bills.</i>

24:24.600 --> 24:27.643
<i>A state-issued nurse would come
by every day for two hours,</i>

24:27.645 --> 24:31.732
<i>and she'd, legit, just play
Candy Crush on her phone.</i>

24:33.025 --> 24:38.072
<i>But, anyway, the point is,
he had, like, a bunch of pills.</i>

25:21.157 --> 25:24.700
<i>He was too out of it
to know I was high.</i>

25:24.702 --> 25:28.078
And I always have
the best time with you.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.333
Me, too.

25:31.459 --> 25:33.669
Do you mind?!

25:41.135 --> 25:44.178
Hey. Uh, I'm gonna need you
to do me a big favor.

25:44.180 --> 25:46.472
You see, there are
a bunch of these meetings

25:46.474 --> 25:51.602
that I was supposed to attend
that I didn't actually attend, so...

25:51.604 --> 25:55.191
I'm gonna need you
to backdate this slip.

25:58.694 --> 26:02.198
Yeah. Ethically, that's a line
I will not cross.

26:08.120 --> 26:12.458
What if I, uh... suck your dick?

26:18.631 --> 26:21.757
Like, in my car?

26:21.759 --> 26:25.054
I'm 17, you fucking creep.
Sign the slip.

26:32.978 --> 26:36.899
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.786
Rue.

26:50.663 --> 26:54.667
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

27:28.784 --> 27:31.120
Um, I'm gonna be right back.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.459
Fuck, yeah.

27:37.752 --> 27:39.503
Fucking slut.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.886
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck...

27:59.023 --> 28:04.026
<i>She never admitted it,
and no one could ever prove it,</i>

28:04.028 --> 28:05.946
<i>but we all knew it was her.</i>

28:27.718 --> 28:32.515
<i>Or, I don't know, I guess for Kat,
it probably felt like we all knew.</i>

28:34.225 --> 28:37.059
<i>That's the weird thing
about the Internet.</i>

28:37.061 --> 28:39.647
<i>Ten people can feel like
the whole world.</i>

28:44.360 --> 28:48.862
Meet me in the cafeteria in
five minutes. We need to talk.

28:48.864 --> 28:50.866
Why?

28:52.326 --> 28:56.078
Listen, Kat. I didn't do anything.
I told Roy not to post it.

28:56.080 --> 29:00.290
It doesn't matter, okay? He's still
sending it to people and saying it's me.

29:00.292 --> 29:02.459
Look, I don't want
my life to be ruined,

29:02.461 --> 29:05.087
and I'm sure you don't want to
end up on a sex offender list.

29:05.089 --> 29:09.842
- Kat, you know I'm not a sex offender.
- It's child pornography, you dumb fuck.

29:09.844 --> 29:13.387
But we're all under 18. Children
can't make child pornography.

29:13.389 --> 29:17.349
- Troy, google it.
- I'm not googling child pornography.

29:17.351 --> 29:21.437
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck
it, I'm going to the police.

29:21.439 --> 29:25.733
All right! Okay. Okay, okay, I get it.
What do you need?

29:25.735 --> 29:28.402
First, for you to delete the video off
your phone...

29:28.404 --> 29:31.280
- ...and whoever's phone you sent it to.
- That is done.

29:31.282 --> 29:35.367
And for you to tell Wes to tell
everybody that it's not me. Okay?

29:35.369 --> 29:39.248
Okay. Done.
Anything else?

29:40.624 --> 29:42.249
Actually, yeah.

29:42.251 --> 29:45.711
<i>So even though Roy and Troy
tried to put an end to it,</i>

29:45.713 --> 29:49.214
Kat? Nah.
It was some other bitch.

29:49.216 --> 29:52.634
Oh, dude. What the fuck?
I thought you said it was Kat.

29:52.636 --> 29:55.179
I did, but, I mixed that bitch up.

29:55.181 --> 29:57.975
<i>By the end of the week...</i>

30:10.905 --> 30:13.781
<i>Katherine Hernandez, please report
to the principal's office.</i>

30:13.783 --> 30:16.659
<i>Katherine Hernandez
to the principal's office.</i>

30:16.661 --> 30:19.161
<i>I heard a very disturbing rumor.</i>

30:19.163 --> 30:22.539
- About what?
- There is a recording of you

30:22.541 --> 30:26.418
engaged in... sexual activity.

30:26.420 --> 30:32.007
Or something to that effect, that is
being shared amongst the students.

30:32.009 --> 30:35.177
Is this about that video of that
girl getting banged from behind?

30:35.179 --> 30:38.889
Because no, it's not me, but...
just out of sheer curiosity,

30:38.891 --> 30:41.600
what could have possibly
led you to believe that is was?

30:41.602 --> 30:45.437
I just want to be clear that I haven't
personally seen the video...

30:45.439 --> 30:48.232
It is because the girl in the
video is fat, Principal Hayes?

30:48.234 --> 30:51.110
I'm not jumping
to conclusions, Katherine...

30:51.112 --> 30:53.946
I'd just appreciate it if everyone would
stop talking to me like it was,

30:53.948 --> 30:57.950
because, frankly, it's... offensive.

30:57.952 --> 31:00.202
You know, it's one thing for my
classmates to body shame me,

31:00.204 --> 31:05.791
but for you, Principal Hayes
that's just... a whole nother thing.

31:05.793 --> 31:09.503
It's degrading.
It's... discriminatory.

31:09.505 --> 31:12.339
And it just goes to show
how insidious, and...

31:12.341 --> 31:16.218
systemic body terrorism
truly is in this country.

31:16.220 --> 31:18.762
From my own principal.

31:18.764 --> 31:23.517
Well, I'm... I'm...
I... I can't apologize enough.

31:23.519 --> 31:25.978
And I give you my word,

31:25.980 --> 31:30.151
I will do everything in my power
to put an end to this rumor.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.319
Thank you, Principal Hayes.

31:33.321 --> 31:35.487
<i>And so on the same way
that mass shootings,</i>

31:35.489 --> 31:37.865
<i>sex scandals,
and stolen elections do,</i>

31:37.867 --> 31:41.201
<i>the whole thing blew over pretty quickly
and we all moved on to the next thing.</i>

31:41.203 --> 31:43.203
- <i>You guys pumped?</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

31:43.205 --> 31:46.373
- Are we gonna win?
- Yeah!

31:46.375 --> 31:51.172
Then let's hear it for the
East Highland Blackhawks!

32:01.724 --> 32:03.893
Yeah, Nate!

32:36.676 --> 32:38.761
Hey, let's go!

32:42.431 --> 32:46.266
I, 100 percent,
do not feel safe right now.

32:46.268 --> 32:49.520
No. So stay
the fuck out of my grill.

32:49.522 --> 32:52.648
- Yo, Maddy.
- What?

32:52.650 --> 32:56.988
- Let me take you out tonight.
- Why?

32:59.907 --> 33:02.743
- I hate you.
- I know.

33:04.704 --> 33:06.912
Seriously?

33:06.914 --> 33:09.039
Seriously?

33:09.041 --> 33:11.417
Seriously.

33:11.419 --> 33:15.337
- I'm over it.
- Rue!

33:15.339 --> 33:18.007
Breathing is clearly not
a priority to you.

33:18.009 --> 33:20.261
- Ding, ding, ding!
- I see. Oh...

33:24.807 --> 33:27.057
Fuck.

33:27.059 --> 33:29.810
Uh, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

33:29.812 --> 33:34.690
I wish. But my dad wants to have like
a capital F, capital D Family Dinner.

33:34.692 --> 33:37.318
Which is weird, because it's
literally just me and him

33:37.320 --> 33:39.572
eating dinner together,
like, every single night.

33:41.741 --> 33:43.866
Well, um, what about later?

33:43.868 --> 33:48.078
I'm probably gonna do some homework.
Binge-watch some <i>Madoka Magica.</i>

33:48.080 --> 33:51.540
Okay, well, um,
maybe you could, like,

33:51.542 --> 33:55.629
come over Sunday night, 'cause my
mom's, like, asking me and stuff.

33:58.257 --> 34:01.300
Are you talking
to your momma about me?

34:01.302 --> 34:04.513
No. Shut up.

34:09.143 --> 34:11.728
- Bye, Rue.
- Bye.

34:15.649 --> 34:17.652
<i>I'm such a loser.</i>

34:40.549 --> 34:43.177
Maddy, I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

34:58.859 --> 35:00.903
Cash or credit?

35:13.708 --> 35:16.583
- Christopher McKay.
- Yep.

35:16.585 --> 35:19.753
Drove down from college
for the weekend.

35:19.755 --> 35:21.298
Yep.

35:23.467 --> 35:26.552
So, what's in store
for Friday night, huh?

35:26.554 --> 35:29.140
Uh, you know.
Just... mm.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.977
Cassie's smitten like
a kitten with you.

35:34.979 --> 35:38.230
Yeah?
Yeah, she's a pretty cool girl.

35:38.232 --> 35:41.817
Well, I tell ya, it's not
easy to hold her attention.

35:41.819 --> 35:45.154
Uh-uh. Like mother,
like daughter.

35:45.156 --> 35:49.742
But she's a good girl.
She's got a good heart.

35:49.744 --> 35:51.787
Yeah. Handle with care.

35:53.456 --> 35:57.124
- I will.
- Mom, stop talking to him.

35:57.126 --> 35:59.501
Excuse me.
I've been dismissed.

35:59.503 --> 36:03.507
You have fun.
Ooh, you look so pretty.

36:05.801 --> 36:08.846
Hey. Want to watch a movie?

36:10.598 --> 36:12.725
Yeah, come on.

36:18.105 --> 36:21.607
Maddy. Why don't you let me
take you out tonight?

36:21.609 --> 36:24.487
I don't know.
Text me.

36:54.558 --> 36:59.230
All right.
No cell phones during dinner.

37:03.484 --> 37:07.277
I don't think I have an attention
span for real life anymore.

37:07.279 --> 37:09.865
Shut up, you smart ass.

37:37.935 --> 37:40.021
<i>Hey, open the door!</i>

37:44.358 --> 37:46.819
- What do you want?
- <i>Open the fucking door.</i>

37:51.824 --> 37:54.033
- Yo, who is it, man?
- <i>Rue.</i>

37:54.035 --> 37:57.036
No, bro, tell her to
come back later. Yo.

37:57.038 --> 37:59.872
- Too late, bitch.
- Hold on, hold on.

37:59.874 --> 38:02.291
- You can be in here right now.
- I see you, cash money.

38:02.293 --> 38:05.753
- Nah, nah.
- I need some some OCs and some socks.

38:05.755 --> 38:08.297
I can't help you
right now. You gotta go.

38:08.299 --> 38:11.175
Yo, for real, Rue. I ain't fuckin'
playing with you. Come on.

38:11.177 --> 38:13.510
- You can't be in here.
- Look, Fez,

38:13.512 --> 38:16.430
I'm fucking drenched.
Okay?

38:16.432 --> 38:21.685
And, uh... I'm out of drugs. So...
Don't be a dick.

38:21.687 --> 38:24.104
Oh, my God.
That's not my fucking problem.

38:24.106 --> 38:25.981
You gotta get up
out of my house right now

38:25.983 --> 38:27.775
before these motherfuckers
come through.

38:27.777 --> 38:30.861
All I need is a couple OCs,
and some Xannies.

38:30.863 --> 38:32.905
That's all
I need, and I can be gone.

38:32.907 --> 38:36.075
Yo, I'm trying to tell you, I
don't got shit right now. Like...

38:36.077 --> 38:38.827
Come back in a few hours,
I got you, whatever you need.

38:38.829 --> 38:41.705
But right now, you gotta get
the fuck up outta my house.

38:41.707 --> 38:43.415
I know you have something, Fez.

38:43.417 --> 38:46.835
I'm just telling you, I don't
got shit for you, Rue, come on.

38:46.837 --> 38:49.088
I need you out the house right now.

38:49.090 --> 38:51.340
My guy's about to come through here.
I don't want you here

38:51.342 --> 38:53.217
when he gets here, you understand?

38:53.219 --> 38:56.679
- Give me drugs.
- This is dead serious.

38:56.681 --> 38:58.516
Yo, Rue.

39:12.446 --> 39:15.491
I could fucking kill you right now.

39:18.744 --> 39:21.163
Yo, Ash, they're here.

39:32.633 --> 39:34.508
Look, I'm serious, Rue.

39:34.510 --> 39:38.721
Just stay right there, keep
your mouth shut, and be cool.

39:38.723 --> 39:41.348
These dudes ain't fucking around.

39:41.350 --> 39:44.476
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie. That's when
I started to get a little scared.</i>

39:44.478 --> 39:47.940
<i>I mean, I'm all good with drugs
until guns start coming out.</i>

40:53.339 --> 40:55.172
<i>Coming out of East Highland,
I've held the state record</i>

40:55.174 --> 40:57.383
for most receiving yards
the last two years in row.

40:57.385 --> 40:59.301
I broke East Highland records
for the most receptions,

40:59.303 --> 41:01.345
the most yards
during the game: 112,

41:01.347 --> 41:03.555
most yards per catch,
most yards after the catch.

41:03.557 --> 41:06.141
And I can fucking block.

41:06.143 --> 41:08.352
And this coach is acting like
he don't want to start me.

41:08.354 --> 41:11.939
Like I haven't earned my due on the
field or something. That's bullshit.

41:11.941 --> 41:14.191
Don't they do that to,
like, all the freshmen?

41:14.193 --> 41:19.198
I'm not all freshman. Look at my stats.
Shit pisses me off. I don't get it.

41:23.202 --> 41:26.745
- You want to kill him?
- What?

41:26.747 --> 41:29.083
Let's fucking kill him.

41:33.004 --> 41:35.170
Cass, I'm serious.

41:35.172 --> 41:37.297
It's not funny. This motherfucker
really pissed me off.

41:37.299 --> 41:41.178
Come on, McKay.
It just takes time.

41:48.185 --> 41:52.898
I thought about you all week.
I'm dying to fuck you.

41:56.235 --> 41:59.405
Why you gotta make
everything so sexual?

42:01.365 --> 42:03.075
What?

42:05.369 --> 42:08.622
I'm trying to have a real-ass
conversation with you.

42:10.583 --> 42:12.626
I'm... I'm sorry.

42:18.674 --> 42:21.344
It's cool, Cassie.
It's all right.

42:37.777 --> 42:42.615
- So this your little bitch?
- Nah, bruh, that's my little sister.

42:45.076 --> 42:47.662
Well, hello, there, little sis.

42:49.830 --> 42:52.206
<i>Now, when Fez said
his dudes were coming over,</i>

42:52.208 --> 42:55.834
<i>I didn't think his dude
would be this dude.</i>

42:55.836 --> 42:59.421
My name is Mouse.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

42:59.423 --> 43:03.384
<i>But you know, that's what happens
when you hang out with drug dealers.</i>

43:03.386 --> 43:05.346
Yo, Custer, toss me that bag.

43:06.764 --> 43:08.555
All right, check it.

43:08.557 --> 43:13.519
I got a 100 OP-OC 80s,
500 Xanny bars, 500 20s of Addy.

43:13.521 --> 43:16.146
I'm low on Vikes, so if
you wanna cop some Vikes,

43:16.148 --> 43:18.565
you better cop 'em today,
'cause I got, like, 50 left.

43:18.567 --> 43:22.736
I got a quap of that Cali
medicinal, and an ounce of Molly.

43:22.738 --> 43:27.408
- Custer, what's the math on that?
- Uh, 25, 15, and 1,100,

43:27.410 --> 43:32.581
35, 77, and 25...
7,750.

43:38.879 --> 43:40.840
Here.

43:43.092 --> 43:47.177
- Sure you don't want no Fentanyl?
- Nah, man, I'm cool off that shit.

43:47.179 --> 43:50.639
There's too many ODs,
and I don't want the heat.

43:50.641 --> 43:54.059
How about you, little sis?
You ever try Fentanyl?

43:54.061 --> 43:57.148
- No.
- No, she's good, bruh.

43:58.774 --> 44:01.734
Gonna let big brother talk for you?

44:01.736 --> 44:05.738
- I don't know.
- Don't look at him. Look at me.

44:05.740 --> 44:07.742
You ever try it?

44:08.951 --> 44:12.786
Yo, for real, bruh. I don't want
her fucking with that shit.

44:12.788 --> 44:14.663
You know that feeling
when you come so hard

44:14.665 --> 44:17.084
that you can't feel or hear shit?

44:19.712 --> 44:23.505
- You like that feeling?
- Yeah.

44:23.507 --> 44:26.969
Well, shit.
You gonna love this.

44:33.309 --> 44:35.684
I'm... I'm good, actually.

44:35.686 --> 44:40.189
- What, you don't trust me?
- Yo, for real, man. She's good.

44:40.191 --> 44:44.735
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Ain't nobody talkin' to you.

44:44.737 --> 44:48.072
Tell your big brother I'm not
talking to him right now.

44:48.074 --> 44:50.741
Tell him,
"Shut the fuck up."

44:50.743 --> 44:54.495
Come on. Don't be scared.
It's not gonna bite you.

44:54.497 --> 44:56.582
Come on. Try it.

45:04.548 --> 45:06.717
Oh, just try it.

45:09.178 --> 45:11.762
<i>Dear God, I know I've been a cunt
for, like, a lot of my life,</i>

45:11.764 --> 45:15.933
<i>and my family
and I am so, so, so sorry, but...</i>

45:15.935 --> 45:18.644
<i>just please, God, I'm begging you,</i>

45:18.646 --> 45:22.149
<i>do not let me die tonight.</i>

45:41.502 --> 45:44.628
- Welcome home.
- Fuck!

45:44.630 --> 45:47.881
- What the fuck, man?
- Hi, Tyler.

45:47.883 --> 45:51.301
What the fuck are you doing here, man?
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

45:51.303 --> 45:54.138
If you're looking for the
kitchen knives, they're here.

45:54.140 --> 45:56.726
Same with the baseball bat
from your room.

45:59.729 --> 46:01.897
Who the fuck are you, man?

46:03.399 --> 46:06.485
I'm the boyfriend of the girl
that you raped on Saturday night.

46:08.988 --> 46:11.822
No, no. Dude, what the fuck?
I wouldn't rape anyone.

46:11.824 --> 46:15.409
I swear to God,
I didn't rape a girl, dude.

46:15.411 --> 46:17.619
But I saw it.

46:17.621 --> 46:22.126
- You saw what?
- I saw you rape her in the pool.

46:25.838 --> 46:29.465
Wait a minute. You're talking about that
crazy chick that was at the party?

46:29.467 --> 46:33.385
That chick was asking me to.
I was the one that was saying no.

46:33.387 --> 46:36.555
- She was blacked out.
- Dude, she wasn't blacked out, man.

46:36.557 --> 46:40.644
I swear to God, she asked me to fuck
her, like, right here, right now.

46:42.021 --> 46:44.273
Do you know how old she is?

46:46.984 --> 46:50.361
- She's like, 18.
- Try 17.

46:50.363 --> 46:54.950
- Fuck, dude, she didn't say that to me.
- And how old are you?

46:56.327 --> 46:58.077
- I'm like, 21.
- You're 22.

46:58.079 --> 47:00.871
- I mean, barely.
- You turned 22 five months ago, Tyler.

47:00.873 --> 47:03.957
Don't fucking lie to me.

47:03.959 --> 47:07.963
So, not only did you rape a
girl, but you raped a minor.

47:09.715 --> 47:11.590
- I'm gonna hurt you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

47:11.592 --> 47:14.426
Yeah, and you're not gonna press
charges, because if you do,

47:14.428 --> 47:17.471
you're gonna go to jail
for a lot longer than I will...

47:17.473 --> 47:20.307
- Please.
- ...depending on what I do to you.

47:20.309 --> 47:22.935
Please, please, please, I am
begging you, please don't do this.

47:22.937 --> 47:25.437
Dude, don't hurt me, please.
Don't do this.

47:25.439 --> 47:28.065
- Get on your knees.
- What?

47:28.067 --> 47:30.567
Get on your knees.

47:30.569 --> 47:33.864
- No. I'm not... -
- Hey, get on your knees. Come on.

47:35.658 --> 47:39.203
Did you seriously think you could rape
a girl and nobody would do anything?

47:42.748 --> 47:47.209
Oh, my God. Fuck!
I didn't do anything, man!

47:47.211 --> 47:49.338
I'm gonna ask you a question.

47:53.175 --> 47:56.385
- Did you rape her?
- No.

47:56.387 --> 47:59.138
- Did you rape her?
- No! Fuck!

47:59.140 --> 48:01.598
Did you rape her?

48:01.600 --> 48:03.434
- Admit it! Did you rape her?
- Fucking ow!

48:03.436 --> 48:05.936
Admit it!
Did you rape her?

48:05.938 --> 48:08.397
Ow! Fuck! No!

48:08.399 --> 48:11.817
Admit it, you fucking faggot!
Did you fucking rape her?

48:11.819 --> 48:15.281
I didn't fucking rape her!

48:38.554 --> 48:40.514
It hits quick.

48:46.812 --> 48:49.023
You like the way that feels?

48:51.067 --> 48:54.862
- Yeah.
- You want a couple of patches, girl?

48:55.988 --> 48:58.783
Okay.

49:04.872 --> 49:07.166
It's gonna cost you 300.

49:08.918 --> 49:14.338
- Come on. Pay up, little sis.
- I only have two dollars.

49:14.340 --> 49:16.759
I said 300.

49:19.011 --> 49:21.806
Where are my pants?

49:23.683 --> 49:27.351
I'll just...
I'll just give it back.

49:27.353 --> 49:32.314
- I got a strict no-return policy.
- Yo, Mouse. Let me pay for it, man.

49:32.316 --> 49:35.401
I thought you was too good
for Fentanyl.

49:35.403 --> 49:38.779
What is it? Everybody's changing
their motherfucking minds on me?

49:38.781 --> 49:40.950
Yeah.

49:42.660 --> 49:46.662
If she can't afford it, she gonna have
to find another way of paying me.

49:46.664 --> 49:48.497
- Straight up.
- Okay.

49:48.499 --> 49:51.002
Yo, man, just let me pay for it.

49:55.089 --> 49:57.133
I got the money right here.

49:59.844 --> 50:01.635
Here.

50:01.637 --> 50:03.804
Dang. Big brother
must love you.

50:03.806 --> 50:06.181
It's gonna cost you 600 now, man.

50:06.183 --> 50:08.892
Damn. You gonna do me
like that, bruh?

50:08.894 --> 50:11.186
Yeah, I'm gonna do you
like that. Straight up.

50:11.188 --> 50:14.650
Get that shit.
There it is.

50:20.698 --> 50:23.951
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

50:31.167 --> 50:33.459
Go flush that shit down the toilet,

50:33.461 --> 50:36.672
and go grab the Narcan,
just in case.

50:57.735 --> 50:59.945
I'm so happy.

51:04.867 --> 51:07.036
I know.

52:57.772 --> 53:00.189
<i>Yo, what's up? It's Fez.</i>

53:00.191 --> 53:03.235
Yeah, look. I'm gonna need
a little help with Rue.

53:04.820 --> 53:07.031
Yeah. ASAP.

54:51.635 --> 54:53.971
Holy shit...

55:37.932 --> 55:42.059
- That guy you fucked in the pool?
- What?

55:42.061 --> 55:44.647
Are you sure you don't remember?

55:46.023 --> 55:48.107
I don't believe you.

55:48.109 --> 55:51.485
- Was it good?
- What?

55:51.487 --> 55:55.364
- The sex.
- What do you want to know, Nate?

55:55.366 --> 55:58.575
You want to know
if his dick was bigger?

55:58.577 --> 56:01.497
- Was it?
- What if it was?

56:02.665 --> 56:04.206
I'd fucking kill him.

56:04.208 --> 56:07.128
Yeah, but dead or alive, he'd still
have a bigger dick than you.

56:36.574 --> 56:38.617
I got you a present.

56:39.744 --> 56:41.704
Thank you.

59:14.538 --> 59:19.538
