- How'd you like it?

- Excuse me?
- The new act. You heard it, right?

- Mm-hmm.   - I figured the show
needed some spark, so I, uh--

I-I've been working on this routine
where Slappy and I fight and argue.

And I put a radio-controlled

and then she ran off to find it.

Mary Ellen said
it wasn't her fault either.

- I don't know. Slappy took it.

15:53.976 --> 15:57.376
- We've got to get out of here
before Slappy finds us.  - [ Panting ]

15:57.376 --> 16:01.509
- Katie!
- Mary Ellen won't let me leave without her.

16:01.509 --> 16:04.043
Harrison, we're gonna get help.

16:04.043 --> 16:06.243
- Stay there.
- Where am I gonna go?

16:06.243 --> 16:08.509
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Jillian ] Let's go.

16:11.809 --> 16:15.576
- [ Both Screaming ]
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]

16:15.576 --> 16:21.476
It's my wedding day,
and I want my bride! [ Laughing ]

16:21.476 --> 16:22.943
Come on!

16:22.943 --> 16:25.276
- [ Both Screaming ]
- [ Laughing Continues ]

16:25.276 --> 16:27.409
Quick! In here!

16:27.809 --> 16:31.009
My bride! My bride!
[ Laughing ]

16:31.009 --> 16:34.776
- Oh, you can run, but you cannot hide!
- Katie, come help me!

16:35.209 --> 16:38.076
I can't.
Mary Ellen won't let me.

16:38.076 --> 16:41.509
We can go through the window.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.776
Come on, Katie, I'll help you up.

16:47.776 --> 16:49.643
- I can't!
- What?

16:49.643 --> 16:51.409
Mary Ellen won't let me.

16:51.409 --> 16:54.976
- She wants to stay here and be with
Slappy.   - All right, Katie, that's it.

16:54.976 --> 16:57.276
Be careful.
Don't make her angry.

16:57.709 --> 17:01.409
- I've had just about enough of this dumb doll.
- Who you calling dumb, ugly?

17:01.409 --> 17:03.409
[ Screams ]

17:04.042 --> 17:06.976
- I told you!
- She's alive too?

17:06.976 --> 17:09.175
Aren't you the smarty-pants.

17:09.175 --> 17:12.742
Tell her, Katie.
Tell your big sister the truth.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.209
She makes me do anything she wants.

17:14.209 --> 17:18.009
If I don't, she says
she'll hurt Mom and Dad and you.

17:18.009 --> 17:21.776
And when she saw Slappy at the
show, she fell in love with him.

17:21.776 --> 17:27.009
And what Mary Ellen wants,
Mary Ellen gets.

17:27.009 --> 17:29.709
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

17:29.709 --> 17:32.709
- [ Screams ]
- Miss me?

17:32.709 --> 17:36.043
[ Laughing ]

17:41.143 --> 17:44.743
Yee-haw!
[ Chuckles ]

17:45.676 --> 17:48.409
My beautiful bride.

17:48.409 --> 17:50.743
See, I even brought the ring.

17:50.743 --> 17:53.409
- That's my mom's ring.
- [ Slappy ] Yeah.

17:53.409 --> 17:55.676
I stole it for the special occasion.

17:55.676 --> 17:59.943
My marriage to the most
perfect girl in the world.

18:00.376 --> 18:04.076
Oh, Slappy.
You say the nicest things.

18:04.076 --> 18:06.509
And now I'm ready to be your bride.

18:06.509 --> 18:10.209
What? Not you! I don't want you,
you cheap piece of plastic!

18:10.209 --> 18:12.809
I want her.

18:12.809 --> 18:15.443
You'll be mine, Katie.
You'll be my slave forever.

18:15.443 --> 18:18.443
[ Laughing ]

18:18.443 --> 18:22.443
After all I've done for you,
this is the thanks I get?

18:22.443 --> 18:25.343
You rotten old piece of wood!

18:25.343 --> 18:29.243
Come on.
There's plenty of me to go around.

18:29.243 --> 18:33.209
[ Slappy, Mary Ellen Grunting ]

18:33.209 --> 18:35.176
Let me-- let me--

18:35.643 --> 18:38.109
Get off of me,
you plastic parasite!

18:38.109 --> 18:42.343
[ Slappy, Mary Ellen Grunting ]

18:43.643 --> 18:46.509
Katie, stay back.

18:46.943 --> 18:49.076
Hyah!
[ Laughing ]

18:49.076 --> 18:51.409
[ Slappy ]
Whoa!

18:51.409 --> 18:54.576
- [ Mary Ellen ] No! No!
- [ Slappy ] You guys cut me up.

18:54.576 --> 18:58.343
[ Saw Cutting ]

19:09.509 --> 19:13.276
[ Slappy, Mary Ellen Laughing ]

19:15.676 --> 19:17.809
- [ Screams ]
- [ Laughing Continues ]

19:22.176 --> 19:24.243
[ Laughing Fades ]

19:24.676 --> 19:28.743
- Is it over?
- It's over.

19:37.776 --> 19:41.009
I'm getting too old for dolls.

19:45.509 --> 19:48.509
There's only one thing
I'm really worried about.

19:49.009 --> 19:52.509
Amazing Jimmy said Slappy's
spirit couldn't be destroyed.

19:52.509 --> 19:56.743
- So where do you think it is now?
[ Door Opens ]

19:57.476 --> 20:00.043
[ Both Gasp ]

20:00.543 --> 20:02.943
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Sighs ] Oh, it's just you.

20:02.943 --> 20:05.943
Well, thanks for the warm welcome.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.876
Is there something wrong, girls?

20:08.876 --> 20:11.609
[ Together ]
No.

20:11.609 --> 20:15.509
- [ Knocking ]
- Oh! We forgot about Harrison.

20:18.076 --> 20:19.743
[ Slappy Laughing ]

20:20.243 --> 20:23.243
What's Harrison doing
in our bathroom?

20:23.243 --> 20:26.243
It's kind of a long story.

20:26.243 --> 20:29.876
Trust me, young lady,
you're going to have time.

20:31.309 --> 20:34.676
Harrison, are you okay?
Harrison?

20:35.543 --> 20:37.909
[ Laughs ]
Hi, folks.

20:37.909 --> 20:40.176
[ Slappy's Voice ]
Harrison doesn't live here anymore.

20:40.176 --> 20:43.243
