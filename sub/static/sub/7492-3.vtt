WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.166
I was up all night working on my project
for the invention fair.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.750
I have something truly amazing.
What do you guys have?

00:14.875 --> 00:16.041
We got nothing.

00:17.083 --> 00:21.333
I am so excited.
We have a special-guest judge this year.

00:21.417 --> 00:26.625
He's from Techtronic Labs and he is not
too hard on this lonely lady's eyes.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.208
Derek Tanner.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.917
Hello, future. I'm Derek.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.417
I can't believe it.
That's my dad's new boss.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.041
He's a genius.

00:39.125 --> 00:41.250
And my personal hero.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.000
This is the Mind Surfer.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.125
You control wherever it goes
with your thoughts.

00:52.625 --> 00:57.083
And that's really what inventing is.
Dreaming things into reality.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.166
You know, I tell them that every day.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.291
But do they listen?

01:00.417 --> 01:01.417
No!

01:03.500 --> 01:04.750
Milton, dude, you gotta help us.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.959
Here we go.
Once again, you've done nothing

01:07.041 --> 01:09.542
and you want credit
by glomming onto my project.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.250
Good. So we're on the same page.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.959
And this is Milton Krupnik.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.834
He's the smartest boy in our class.

01:16.917 --> 01:19.375
Ah, Milton.
If you're anything like your father,

01:19.458 --> 01:21.875
I'm sure your project
will be most impressive.

01:21.959 --> 01:24.041
Okay.

01:24.792 --> 01:28.792
Right now the only competition you have
is something called the Butt Whistle.

01:30.125 --> 01:31.667
Put it away, Eric!

01:33.709 --> 01:35.083
May I present...

01:38.500 --> 01:40.291
May we present...

01:41.208 --> 01:42.792
The Corn Coddlers.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.667
Yes! The corn codl-- What now?

01:47.250 --> 01:50.875
Every Wednesday night,
I have to give my Nana a foot massage.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.709
Oh! An old lady under a tarp.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.458
Already better than the Butt Whistle.

02:00.208 --> 02:04.750
Between her bunions, calluses,
and gnarled up corns,

02:05.166 --> 02:07.375
I'm dealing with some pretty tough feet.

02:09.458 --> 02:13.291
These mechanized gloves give my hands
the strength of 10 men.

02:13.417 --> 02:16.208
Allowing me to do this.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.041
Ooh!

02:25.750 --> 02:28.500
Well, this is just embarrassing.

02:30.709 --> 02:34.041
That I didn't think
of such a fantastic invention!

02:35.375 --> 02:38.917
How did you manage to increase
the strength of the human hand tenfold?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.792
- I used Greenblatt's law of inverse...
- Inverse...

02:41.875 --> 02:43.500
to maximize its relative force...

02:43.583 --> 02:45.291
- Force. Power.
- increasing its power.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.959
It's simple, really.

02:49.583 --> 02:53.750
Well, you three boys are going
on a V.I.P. tour of Techtronic Labs.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.625
Because you are the winners!

02:55.709 --> 02:57.458
- All right!
-

02:57.542 --> 02:59.375
-
- Get over it, Eric. You lost.

What are all these people doing?

03:49.125 --> 03:50.375
Oh, when a carnival comes to town,

03:50.458 --> 03:52.959
they usually try and drum up business
with their sideshow attractions.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.166
Ladies and gentlemen!

03:55.291 --> 03:59.166
Behold the beautiful, the mesmerizing...

03:59.250 --> 04:01.750
Unicornia.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.208
Are you kidding me? What kind of sucker
would believe in "Unicornia"?

04:13.333 --> 04:15.792
Unicornia! I love you!

04:19.417 --> 04:22.000
She's even more beautiful
than in her pictures.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.834
Sam. Sam. Sam.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.583
Let's go meet her. Come on.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.750
Hey guys, Mr. Tanner called me
and told me to bring in my Corn Coddlers.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.625
Our Corn Coddlers.

04:36.166 --> 04:38.083
Guys, this tour is a big deal to me.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.000
Please don't do anything to embarrass me.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.125
Come on, we're not gonna embarrass you.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.583
We know how important this is for you.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.834
I'm even gonna put on my new deodorant.
It's called "De-stank".

04:47.041 --> 04:49.542
Oh, classy. Dude, can I get some of that?

04:49.625 --> 04:50.583
Yeah, yeah.

04:59.709 --> 05:01.583
<i>Welcome to Techtronic Labs.</i>

05:01.834 --> 05:04.834
This is Hans, an award winning physicist.

05:04.917 --> 05:07.792
Last year he invented
a geothermal earthquake detector

05:07.875 --> 05:09.709
that saved thousands of lives.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.500
Oh, what's he working on now?

05:11.583 --> 05:13.250
Rubber snot.

05:15.625 --> 05:18.250
Oh, finally. Something the world needs.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.709
We're very excited about this.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.834
We've been contracted
by a security company

05:24.917 --> 05:27.417
to invent an invisible guard dog.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.542
It's very exciting.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.166
I'm sorry?

05:30.250 --> 05:34.625
Dr. Korachi is grooming King,
a purebred German Shepherd.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.333
Okay.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.583
Yeah. Oh, no, sure he is.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.291
There's a big doggy on that table.

05:46.542 --> 05:47.834
Oh, hey, fella.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.792
Oh, look at me. I'm a little kitty cat.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.291
- Meow.
- Please don't do that.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.083
- Want to get the kitty cat?
- Please don't--

06:00.083 --> 06:02.375
Jack! Jack! He got the little kitty cat!

06:02.458 --> 06:04.166
- I got you, man.
-

06:04.583 --> 06:05.750
Come on, get up.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.834
That was close. I think he's gone.

06:11.583 --> 06:14.000
- Oh, no, he's back.
-

06:14.083 --> 06:17.500
Jack! Jack, he's got my leg!
Jack, he's got my leg!

06:18.250 --> 06:22.083
- You're very different from those two.
- Yes, very.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.834
My guess is,
when it came to your invention,

06:24.917 --> 06:26.458
you did all the work, hmm?

06:26.542 --> 06:29.417
Oh, no, no. I... I wouldn't say that.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.583
I think that we all-- They did nothing.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.959
I know. Only a genius
could design those gloves.

06:35.041 --> 06:38.417
And you, my friend,
could be the next Derek Tanner.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.208
- Would you excuse me for one second?
- Oh, yes.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.458
You were saying?

06:48.208 --> 06:53.083
Milton, be careful no one takes advantage
of your brilliant mind.

06:53.709 --> 06:54.792
What are you talking about?

06:54.875 --> 06:57.834
Well, your friends. Jack and Jerry.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.625
They appear to be nothing more than,
well...

06:59.959 --> 07:01.041
parasites.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.041
Hey, guys. Bad news.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.709
King just ran through the cloning machine.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.250
- Yeah.
-

07:16.417 --> 07:20.959
This place is lame. On that last ride,
I got puke all over my shoes.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.458
Yeah, sorry about that.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.750
Little kiddie caterpillar train
what a lot faster than it looked.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.458
Look, can we just go home?
I mean, this pla--

07:30.250 --> 07:31.125
Wow!

07:33.083 --> 07:35.917
Ah. You like the T-Rex, huh?

07:36.291 --> 07:37.208
Okay.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.333
You know what? I'm gonna knock Abe's
hat off and win it for you.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.000
Please. I'm a Sensei.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.375
I can do this in one shot.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.291
That's why they call me...

07:50.834 --> 07:51.750
One shot.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.083
You might need a few
more balls, one shot.

08:01.166 --> 08:06.250
<i>♪ And no matter how much I chop and punch
It's not as cool as kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

08:20.041 --> 08:21.333
- Jerry.
- Sorry.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.625
I guess Tanner's
still showing Milton around.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.625
Psst. Psst. Come here.

08:39.709 --> 08:41.917
Dude, what are you doing? It's restricted.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.166
We're on a V.I.P. tour.
What do you think V.I.P. stands for?

08:45.250 --> 08:48.125
- "Visit it please".
- No, dude!

08:48.667 --> 08:49.625
Don't go--

08:50.125 --> 08:51.417
Whoa.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.208
- Dude.
- Dude, check it out.

08:55.583 --> 08:56.709
It's our gloves.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.375
Looks like Tanner really amped them up.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.667
Dude, look.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.375
I think they're gonna be part
of this crazy suit.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.875
The stuff in this room looks different

09:05.959 --> 09:07.458
from the stuff
they're developing out there.

09:07.959 --> 09:10.709
I know. These things look dangerous.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.291
- Yeah.
- Hey, what do you think this does?

09:13.417 --> 09:15.291
- Jerry, don't.
-

09:18.875 --> 09:21.625
- Dude, are you okay?
- What? I can't hear you.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.959
What are you two doing in here?

09:24.041 --> 09:25.333
This room is restricted.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.333
That's what I told him, Sir.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.959
There are things called boundaries, Jack.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.583
- Huh?
- The tour's over. You're leaving.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.917
You know,
the stuff in this room is dangerous.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.083
You know,
the stuff in this room is dangerous!

09:39.792 --> 09:42.166
You have no idea who you're messing with.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.750
These two are banned for life!

09:43.834 --> 09:45.750
You're in a band with your wife?

09:45.834 --> 09:47.583
Right on, dude.
What kind of stuff do you play?

09:56.291 --> 09:59.250
Rudy, we've been here two hours.
You're out of money.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.542
Let's go.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.458
I am going to win you that dinosaur!

10:05.166 --> 10:06.709
Oh. No, no, I just remembered.

10:06.959 --> 10:09.208
I have an emergency dollar taped
to my chest.

10:13.667 --> 10:14.500
Here.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.166
No. No, no, no, no, no. I did it!

10:23.250 --> 10:24.667
This game is rigged.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.041
I am taking what's mine!

10:31.375 --> 10:34.041
You people are gonna give carnies
a bad name!

10:39.458 --> 10:41.000
Nice. Again.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.500
That was good.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.959
- Well, you know what?
-

10:49.458 --> 10:50.959
I hope you guys are happy.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.583
You almost ruined the most
important day of my life

10:53.667 --> 10:56.125
and embarrassed me in front
of my new friend Derek Tanner.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.709
There's something off about that guy.

11:00.208 --> 11:03.083
He had this drawing of a weaponized suit,
and our gloves were a part of it.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.291
Our gloves?

11:04.709 --> 11:06.834
There's no "our". Those are my gloves.

11:06.917 --> 11:10.750
And you two are questioning
a genius like Tanner? That's a laugh.

11:11.667 --> 11:15.458
You know what? Tanner was right.
You guys are parasites.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.792
Parasites?

11:17.875 --> 11:21.709
Oh, you did not just call us parasites!
Us? We're para--

11:21.792 --> 11:22.917
What's a parasite?

11:23.750 --> 11:24.709
It's not good.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.083
You hang out with that creep Tanner
for one day,

11:28.166 --> 11:29.709
and you turn into a real jerk.

11:30.834 --> 11:31.959
Really?

11:32.041 --> 11:34.250
Well, that creep just hired this jerk.

11:34.750 --> 11:36.333
What?
- That's right.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.083
Through Techtronic's work-study program,

11:38.166 --> 11:39.750
I can finish school while working there,

11:39.834 --> 11:42.291
surrounded by people who appreciate me!

11:42.625 --> 11:45.875
Oh, really?
Well, what's to appreciate anyway?

11:45.959 --> 11:48.208
You're just a skinny brainiac
who's gotten me through school,

11:48.291 --> 11:50.333
while guiding me
through the pitfalls of puberty,

11:50.375 --> 11:52.709
and is one of the best friends
a boy could ever have!

11:52.792 --> 11:54.959
Aw, Jack! What have you done, man?

12:00.250 --> 12:03.375
It used to be, when you're
in the middle of a sweltering heat wave,

12:03.750 --> 12:05.375
there was nothing you could do.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.834
But not anymore!

12:07.917 --> 12:10.208
Thanks to "The Blizzard-Brella".

12:19.291 --> 12:21.834
Booya! That's my boy.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.250
I've never said that before.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.750
It's fun to say "booya". It's like a--

12:26.834 --> 12:29.166
Like a party in your mouth. Booya, booya!

12:31.000 --> 12:34.625
You know, Milton,
I've got very big plans for you.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.667
Bigger than snowing umbrellas?

12:37.208 --> 12:39.208
Oh, yes.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.959
This is where the real science happens.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.291
Why don't you, uh, try on your gloves?

12:48.208 --> 12:50.959
I made a few minor adjustments.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.041
And now they're as strong as 100 men.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.875
Why don't you try to bend
that manhole cover?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.500
Manhole cover?

12:58.166 --> 12:59.500
That's impossible.

13:02.709 --> 13:03.875
Whoa!

13:04.625 --> 13:06.583
There things are, like, powerful.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.959
Your Nana's feet must be really jacked up.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.542
My Nana's feet are beautiful!

13:13.208 --> 13:16.959
These aren't really for Nanas.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.375
They're for a very select customer.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.583
One that's willing to spend
a lot of money.

13:21.667 --> 13:25.000
But what if those customers
turn out to be bad people?

13:25.208 --> 13:28.750
Oh.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.709
Oh, they are bad people.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.834
That's how you make the most money.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.500
By selling illegal weapons to bad people.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.166
- Look, Milton.
-

13:37.250 --> 13:40.291
I chose you because you remind me
of a younger me.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.375
Together, nothing could stop us.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.250
I am nothing like you!

13:45.333 --> 13:47.542
And I don't want to create things
that hurt people.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.875
You know what?
You're not getting any more of my ideas.

13:50.959 --> 13:51.875
I quit.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.083
I understand.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.917
But, uh, you know, it would be a shame

13:58.000 --> 14:00.125
if something bad were to happen
to your father.

14:00.208 --> 14:03.417
I mean, labs are very dangerous places.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.000
And accidents happen all the time.

14:06.083 --> 14:09.417
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.
Krupnik men are very safe.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.875
Our family motto is, "Slow down, you".

14:13.208 --> 14:17.667
No. I'm talking about
a very different kind of accident.

14:17.750 --> 14:18.834
Oh.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.667
Like not wearing safety goggles
when you work with bromium sulfate?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.500
No. I--

14:24.583 --> 14:26.959
Forgetting your insulation tongs
when you work with dry ice?

14:27.041 --> 14:28.083
No! I--

14:28.166 --> 14:30.125
Accidentally mixing together
magnesium chlo--

14:30.208 --> 14:32.667
I'm going to hurt your father!

14:34.083 --> 14:36.166
Wow, I wasn't even in the ballpark.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.500
Oh!

14:41.291 --> 14:43.208
Look, Rudy, why don't we just go home?

14:43.291 --> 14:46.041
You're not going home
until you get a magical memory.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.917
I am getting you that T-Rex.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.083
I just have to figure out
a way to get back in here.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.834
Why don't you just put on a costume

14:57.917 --> 14:59.709
and sneak through
the performers' entrance?

15:00.709 --> 15:01.625
I got it!

15:01.834 --> 15:03.083
Why don't I just put on a costume

15:03.166 --> 15:05.083
and sneak through
the performers' entrance?

15:06.583 --> 15:07.709
Yeah, that might work.

15:19.583 --> 15:20.625
What are you doing here?

15:20.709 --> 15:22.917
Certainly not being banned for life,
that's for sure.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.917
Showtime, let's go.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.917
Wha... But...

15:27.583 --> 15:29.375
Ladies and gentlemen!

15:29.458 --> 15:32.834
Here he is, the international legend...

15:32.959 --> 15:34.291
Iron gut!

15:34.375 --> 15:35.667
The only human on the planet

15:35.750 --> 15:38.542
who can catch a cannonball
with his stomach!

15:39.750 --> 15:42.917
Whoa-ho-ho! I gotta see this.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Blow a hole through his belly!

15:47.583 --> 15:48.667
Oh, no.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.208
Woo!

15:57.291 --> 15:58.125
Let's go.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.375
-
- That was good. Now again.

16:02.917 --> 16:04.083
-
- That's good.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.250
Hey, guys.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.208
Seriously? Again?

16:12.041 --> 16:15.792
Milton. Surprised you came back
to hang out with the parasites.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.625
I'm not staying.
I just came to clear out my locker.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.250
So, you're really not coming back anymore?

16:23.667 --> 16:26.458
I couldn't if I wanted to.
Mr. Tanner forbid it.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.291
I don't wanna talk about it.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.291
Something's wrong.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.417
His sparkle's gone.

16:36.375 --> 16:39.041
Dude, you can tell us what's wrong.
Man, we always have your back.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.834
Whatever it is.
Anything you need, no matter what.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.542
We will be there for you, bro.

16:46.083 --> 16:49.250
Tanner is forcing me to make evil
and dangerous weapons.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.250
If I don't, something terrible
is gonna happen to my dad.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.458
Well, Tanner sounds crazy.
Good luck with that.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.458
Sit down.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.709
Iron gut, iron gut!

17:02.792 --> 17:04.792
Iron gut, iron gut!

17:04.875 --> 17:07.291
- You gotta do it again. They love you.
- No way.

17:07.375 --> 17:12.667
I am breathing through a hole in my ribs.
My stomach is halfway up my nose.

17:12.959 --> 17:15.458
And I think one of my kidneys
is in the tilt-a-whirl.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.291
Come on, name you price.
There's gotta be something you want.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.625
No, no, there is absolutely nothing that--

17:23.250 --> 17:24.125
Wait.

17:25.083 --> 17:26.291
Maybe there is one thing.

17:26.834 --> 17:29.291
Iron gut, iron gut!

17:32.667 --> 17:34.792
I did it once. I can do it--

17:34.875 --> 17:37.500
Oh, mama!
That thing's bigger than a house.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.667
See you, Rudy.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.792
Tanner said everything
in that room is illegal.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.417
Great, so we just need to grab the gloves,
take them to the police.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.208
And that should be enough
to put Tanner in jail.

18:00.291 --> 18:01.375
Perfect. Let's go.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.500
The gloves... they're gone!

18:08.959 --> 18:10.417
He must have known we were coming.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.125
- We gotta get out of here.
- Go, go.

18:12.208 --> 18:15.291
Hello, boys. Looking for these?

18:18.542 --> 18:20.000
Guys, I found the gloves.

18:21.625 --> 18:22.917
Too bad, Milton.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.625
Together we could have done
amazing things.

18:25.709 --> 18:29.166
I wouldn't do anything with you.
You're a monster!

18:29.250 --> 18:32.166
We're going to the authorities
and telling them everything.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.000
No, you're not.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.041
You think I'm afraid of you
and some amped-up Corn Coddlers?

18:41.166 --> 18:42.875
I got this. Ah!

18:49.041 --> 18:49.875
Oh!

19:02.959 --> 19:07.083
Funny, Milton, you're about
to be destroyed by your own hand.

19:07.166 --> 19:08.250
Our hand!

19:13.750 --> 19:15.166
Uh...

19:41.000 --> 19:41.875
No!

19:42.417 --> 19:45.834
You destroyed the gloves
that cost me a million dollars!

19:46.083 --> 19:50.375
And you dented my pinky ring!

19:51.917 --> 19:53.500
You were right about one thing.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.834
Labs can be very dangerous.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.625
I'm sorry I got so carried away.

20:07.709 --> 20:12.375
I forgot who I was. I wanted so badly
to be the next Derek Tanner.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.458
Ah, it's all good, man.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.375
We're just glad
to have the old Milton Krupnik back.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.834
I always thought there was something off
with Tanner.

20:18.375 --> 20:21.250
Milton, I'm really proud of you
for standing up to him.

20:21.542 --> 20:22.792
That showed guts.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.542
The only reason I had the guts was
because Jack and Jerry had my back.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.125
I have plenty of time
to become a great inventor.

20:30.458 --> 20:31.917
Now's the time to be with my friends.

20:33.625 --> 20:34.917
Hey, uh, where's Jerry?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.792
Oh, he went to get his hat
in the cloning room.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.750
All right, guys. I'm ready to go.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.750
Hey, how about we stop and get some pizza?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.417
- I'll pay.
- I'd like that.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.166
All right, guys. Ready to go.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.834
- Didn't he just--
- All right, guys. Ready to go.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.250
I'm only paying for one Jerry.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.875
<i>♪ Kickin' in it with you! ♪</i>

21:03.291 --> 21:06.667
The carnival's amazing, Rudy.
I can't wait to come back next year.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.375
You know what, find someone else.
I am never coming back here.

21:12.250 --> 21:16.166
Hey. Save your money, little girl.
It's a complete scam.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.250
Winner!

21:19.875 --> 21:21.709
So she got lucky once, big deal.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.458
And she wins again.

21:23.542 --> 21:25.000
- No.
- And again!

21:25.083 --> 21:26.291
- No.
- And again!

21:26.375 --> 21:28.667
- No.
- And again!

21:28.750 --> 21:30.542
Faster Sam, get me out of here.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.750
The lady can't loose!

21:56.875 --> 21:58.875
<i>Poor soul.
-</i>

22:02.000 --> 22:02.834
<i>Yes!</i>
