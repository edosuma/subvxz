00:45.003 --> 00:45.962
Everybody down!

00:46.087 --> 00:48.423
You move, you die!
I said down!

01:02.979 --> 01:04.313
Don't even think about it, rent-a-cop.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.913
- Get down! I said, get down!
- Nobody move! Get down!

01:20.038 --> 01:21.748
Where's the money you picked up,
rent-a-cop?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.208
Where? I know it's here!

01:31.883 --> 01:35.220
Eagle 40419er.
This is Eagle 4.

01:35.345 --> 01:39.265
Hostage situation at the Sir Save-A-Lot
on Lankershim and Cahuenga.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.227
I'm on my way.
Eagle 4 out.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.307
Enough talk! Give me
what I want or people die!

03:02.432 --> 03:04.767
You better hope to God
you didn't call for backup,

03:04.893 --> 03:07.770
'cause I will paint the walls
with these people's brains.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.660
No more talk!
I know you're stalling.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.205
You have no idea what
you're dealing with, pig.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.248
Give me what I want, now!

03:29.667 --> 03:31.669
Take the rest of the day off.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.006
All right, let's have it.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.758
Who the fuck are you
and what do you want?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.219
- Your demands, what are they?
- Are you stalling me?

03:39.344 --> 03:40.720
I already told the other guy.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.556
Well, I just relieved the other guy,
so you'll be dealing with me now.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.600
Let me spell it out for you.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.728
According to my department policy,
I'm supposed to ask for your demands,

03:48.853 --> 03:50.897
try and meet them
and make sure nobody gets hurt.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.523
Well, follow your policy, then.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.317
Yeah, but seeing as you're
a little slow on the uptake

03:54.442 --> 03:55.735
I think we'll just storm the place,

03:55.860 --> 03:58.071
beat the shit out of you punks,
and throw your asses in jail.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.240
- What do you think about that?
- What?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.201
I'm asking if you want to do this
the easy way or the hard way.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.535
What?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.624
You got one of those
hearing impediments, son?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.377
You know what?
You had your chance, we're coming in.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.675
Oh shit. Shit!
They're coming in.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.136
Heads up!
They're coming in!

05:01.551 --> 05:04.345
I'll blow this motherfucker's head off!
I swear to God!

05:04.470 --> 05:05.847
- Drop it now!
- OK, OK, OK!

05:05.972 --> 05:07.307
Hands where I can see 'em!

05:07.432 --> 05:09.434
Look! Slowly.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.478
My weapon, my weapon.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.856
One more fucking step
and he gets it!

05:14.981 --> 05:17.233
Putting it down, putting it down.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.609
Put it down!

05:19.777 --> 05:21.738
- Down! Now!
- OK, OK, OK.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.532
All right, nice and slow.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.200
All right, two fingers.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.328
- The pistol!
- All right.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.505
Shit. Oh shit!

05:58.649 --> 06:01.652
Oh! That?
Just a little noise. Are we good?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.530
The fucking rifle, cowboy!
Put it down!

06:04.655 --> 06:08.368
This is not a rifle,
this is Daisy.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.869
She's a BB gun.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.162
What?

06:12.413 --> 06:16.918
Vintage Red Rider, 1965,
got it for Christmas,

06:17.043 --> 06:19.170
so she's kind of
a good luck charm.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.339
- So I can't give her up.
- A BB gun?

07:31.242 --> 07:32.160
Good job well done.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.287
More of the public
protected and served.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.998
And more bad guys
off our streets.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.793
All right, what is this?
LAPD SWAT public service announcement?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.503
Can be, boss. Can be.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.840
So what are you gonna say
for your speech, Hunt?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.300
What speech?

07:47.425 --> 07:50.970
You know, the one where we're all
awarded the "officer of the year. "

07:51.095 --> 07:53.639
Oh, that speech.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.392
I'd sincerely like to
thank the people of LA

07:56.517 --> 07:58.686
for trusting us with
automatic weapons,

07:58.811 --> 08:01.439
and I'd also like to thank
the mayor for allowing us -

08:01.564 --> 08:03.024
Allowing us
to drive at twice the speed limit

08:03.149 --> 08:04.817
that time you had to take a piss.
Remember that?

08:04.942 --> 08:06.319
That was major.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.196
All right, folks,
knock it off, knock it off.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.031
This is serious business.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.200
Chief wants to see us
after our shift.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.326
For real?

08:13.451 --> 08:15.536
Today was our 30th
successful mission.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.206
Chief probably recognized that
and wants to talk to us about it.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.082
You're damn right.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.752
Just remember, when the Chief
pats you on the back,

08:22.877 --> 08:25.338
stand up straight,
look the man in the eyes,

08:25.463 --> 08:26.839
tell him that you're
honored to serve.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.342
What, did you think
you were in Baghdad?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.970
Some kind of TV shoot-out?

08:33.095 --> 08:35.097
I got dead thieves.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.309
I got wounded hostages!

08:40.394 --> 08:43.606
I got a store manager in the hospital
with a concussion

08:43.731 --> 08:45.608
from a flying steak!

08:45.733 --> 08:47.693
What the fuck is that?

08:47.818 --> 08:51.656
I got an armored-car guard
with a broken pelvis.

08:52.281 --> 08:55.660
And I got a national food chain
suing the department

08:55.785 --> 08:57.995
for a quarter of a million
in property damage

08:58.120 --> 09:02.250
caused by LAPD SWAT
in less than ten fucking minutes!

09:03.209 --> 09:05.086
What you got to say
for yourselves, God damn it?

09:05.211 --> 09:09.048
Uh, we rescued
all the hostages.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.220
How would you like a nice cup

09:14.345 --> 09:17.223
of shut the fuck up, Sergeant Hunt?!

09:17.348 --> 09:19.016
I'm told you...

09:20.184 --> 09:22.728
discharged a Red Rider BB gun

09:22.853 --> 09:25.231
into the forehead of one of the robbers.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.817
Sergeant Hunt, since when did
the Los Angeles Police Department

09:27.942 --> 09:30.695
start issuing Daisy BB guns
to its SWAT team?!

09:32.363 --> 09:35.074
Chief, as team leader,
I accept full responsibility.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.909
For what?

09:37.034 --> 09:39.829
For charging a hostage
like a raped Cape buffalo?

09:39.954 --> 09:43.583
For exploding his left testicle,
and swelling his asshole shut

09:43.708 --> 09:45.918
to the point where he needs
machinery to pass shit?!

09:49.213 --> 09:53.175
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me,
is this the funny squad now?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.386
Am I amusing you motherfuckers?

09:58.723 --> 10:01.851
Let me tell you cowboys
what's in store for you.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.938
You are all immediately suspended

10:06.063 --> 10:08.274
and placed on unpaid leave.

10:08.399 --> 10:11.902
You will all, immediately,
as in tomorrow,

10:12.028 --> 10:14.697
report for mandatory retraining,

10:14.822 --> 10:18.826
where you will run hostage
recovery drills all day long

10:18.951 --> 10:21.787
until you can figure out
how to recover hostages

10:21.912 --> 10:23.289
without killing their captors,

10:23.414 --> 10:26.667
and causing hundreds of thousands
of dollars in property damage!

10:26.792 --> 10:28.085
Fuck!

10:32.590 --> 10:37.178
I've also taken the liberty
of booking you clowns

10:37.303 --> 10:39.263
a class with the feds,

10:39.388 --> 10:42.141
to further your higher learning.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.771
Dismissed!

10:51.067 --> 10:53.611
And I'll be checking up
on all your asses!

11:00.993 --> 11:03.371
.. therefore causing
harm to the hostage,

11:03.496 --> 11:05.039
as well as to the captor

11:05.164 --> 11:08.084
and possibly
to innocent bystanders.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.170
Now, in these situations
we always prefer to talk,

11:11.295 --> 11:14.757
to negotiate, not to go in
with guns blazing...

11:14.882 --> 11:16.175
Just like the academy, huh?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.302
Isn't that correct, Captain Tate?

11:21.639 --> 11:23.099
Yes, sir, that's correct.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.517
Really?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.686
Yes, sir. You got it.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.145
Yeah, I think so, that's right.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.942
June 1998, Atlanta, Georgia.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.320
A lone gunman,
Clarence Lee Boyer...

11:36.445 --> 11:39.073
Ever notice how these criminals
have three names all the time?

11:39.198 --> 11:42.952
...breaks into a daycare centre,
takes 16 children hostage.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.747
Now, the hostage negotiators
have Mr. Boyer on the phone,

11:46.872 --> 11:50.876
they also have his sole demand,
$10,000, on hand.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.962
Correct technique
to use in this case...

11:53.087 --> 11:55.214
Present.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.675
-...would have been?
- Hunt.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.886
The correct technique would be
to breach from the rear,

12:01.011 --> 12:04.932
throw in a concussion grenade, and take
him out at close range with a shotgun.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.521
Uh, this is a daycare full
of children, Sergeant Hunt.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.064
You're an idiot.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.525
The man said it's a daycare
full of children.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.486
I say you go in with an M4
and shoot around the little bastards.

12:19.530 --> 12:23.451
I think you're all, uh,
missing the sensitivity of the situation.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.162
The hostage negotiator
has the money the man wants,

12:26.287 --> 12:29.039
the gunman has agreed
to release the kids.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.875
It's sensitive because
of the kids, guys.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.253
You never go in with a flashbang grenade
in a room full of children.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.840
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Exactly, so you would...

12:37.965 --> 12:40.551
Use tear gas.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.511
You breach the door,
you throw it in,

12:42.636 --> 12:43.804
you wait till they're all gasping

12:43.929 --> 12:45.431
and then you take out the shooter

12:45.556 --> 12:47.141
'cause the kids are here
and the guy is there.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.018
I think you're all
missing the point here.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.936
Are you guys out of your minds?

12:51.061 --> 12:53.814
See, this is exactly
why the Chief's pissed off.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.901
Big guy's gonna talk.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.779
All right.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.947
Now the hostages are kids, right?

13:02.072 --> 13:03.157
- Mm-hm.
- Right.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.326
Now the negotiator
has the money on hand, right?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.744
- Yeah.
- Yes.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.205
Now dude says he'll come out
if he gets his cash, right?

13:09.330 --> 13:12.166
- He's gonna come out peacefully.
- Right.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.585
So then the solution
to the problem would be?

13:18.589 --> 13:19.840
Anybody?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.969
The solution to the problem

13:24.094 --> 13:25.971
would be to breach
from the rear,

13:26.096 --> 13:28.349
throw in a flashbang,
and a tear gas

13:28.474 --> 13:30.184
because you can
never be too sure.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.938
Then you come in with an M4
and you shoot the sumbitch.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.065
The parts you guys seem
to forget all the time

13:36.190 --> 13:38.025
is to bring lollipops
and blankets for the kids.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.485
- Am I right or am I right?
- That's it, that's it.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.153
- That's why he's the captain!
- That was it, that was it.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.613
Now am I right or am I right?

13:42.738 --> 13:44.532
- I rest my case.
- Amen.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.577
Tate, that's it,
I mean it's all in here, it's all in here.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.997
I mean, right here. Yeah, man.
the lollipop section.

14:40.337 --> 14:44.300
OK, all right, all right.
Argh! My suit.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.261
OK, let's start from the beginning.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.305
OK, I know
you hid it here.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.433
Now, you can tell me where it is,
or you can die right now.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.144
And I will use the time
I waste in talking to you

14:55.269 --> 14:56.896
to find the item myself.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.608
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.987
Oh, llya,
loose this little tickler.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.573
I said, watch my fucking suit, man,
all right?

15:07.698 --> 15:09.658
Shall I cut his tongue out?

15:09.783 --> 15:12.161
- Do it.
- No! J-Just wait!

15:13.454 --> 15:17.166
Uh... C-Can we just
talk about this?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.667
Oh, Kenny,
we are talking.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.378
You see, your lips are moving
and words are coming out.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.755
We are talking.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.549
OK, OK.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.720
I want you to listen carefully. OK?

15:29.845 --> 15:32.681
I know you hid my property here.
I just don't know where.

15:32.806 --> 15:36.060
So...you are going
to find it for me...

15:36.185 --> 15:39.229
or I will make sure Ilya does
what Ilya does best -

15:40.189 --> 15:41.523
butchering.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.821
Yeah, uh...

15:49.531 --> 15:50.783
there's a problem.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.077
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.747
You know your buddies,
the Italians?

15:56.872 --> 16:00.292
Well, they also know
the item is here.

16:00.417 --> 16:04.129
And how would they
know that, Kenny?

16:04.254 --> 16:05.756
You little cockroach.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.425
My gut told me
I needed insurance.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.469
You faggot! Move it!

16:10.594 --> 16:12.262
- Hey, watch my suit.
- Hurry!

16:12.388 --> 16:14.640
Ilya, move the car inside.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.402
Well, I guess a little
mountain air could be good.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.655
Well, won't I be pulling the Chief's boot
out of my ass for the next week.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.533
I don't think I've ever
seen him that mad.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.326
Yeah, some commendation.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.495
- Well, it could be worse.
- Wait for it.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.414
Mall security at the galleria?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.541
At least Blanco has a whole
lot of steaks to throw.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.710
- It was a fillet mignon.
- Yeah, what's the difference?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.295
A fillet mignon only
includes the tenderloin.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.383
A porterhouse includes
the bone and some strip loin.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.467
What are you, a fucking butcher?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.511
I was gonna be,
before I went to the academy.

16:52.636 --> 16:56.098
Well, congratulations. You have a keen
grasp of bovine anatomy. I'm happy for you.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.435
Yeah, a 1200-pound steer only
has 4 to 6 pounds of tenderloin.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.186
It's non-weight-bearing muscle.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.564
- That's why it's so tender.
- Now I'm hungry. Fuck you.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.108
They usually cut it
into more or less round pieces,

17:06.233 --> 17:07.818
about the size of a baseball.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.153
Well, it worked,
whatever it was.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.404
Thank you.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.573
Why the hell are we headed
out to the sticks?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700
Something about us
not being able to damage anything.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.726
- What you looking at, Pocahontas?
- These are recent.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.770
You can tell all that
from all that?

17:42.895 --> 17:46.899
Yeah, these are Michelin Pilot Sports,
245-35 ZR 20's.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.819
Car needs an alignment,
pulls a little to the right.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.821
Half tank of gas,

17:52.946 --> 17:55.699
and the driver weighs
over 220 pounds.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.410
Really?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.331
Naw, I'm just fucking
with you.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.999
No, but a car has been
through here not too long ago.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.627
Son of a...bitch!

18:09.254 --> 18:10.923
What's wrong with you?

18:16.428 --> 18:17.721
Thank you.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.350
So, pretty nice, huh?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.143
Oh yes, I love what you've
done with the place.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.522
- Now, let's go find the item.
- All right. Yeah.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.526
Sure, yeah, I'll get it,
but, uh, you stay here.

18:30.651 --> 18:34.363
Kenny, you know, I was born at night,
but it was not last night.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.907
OK? I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.163
You made a rhyme there. Yeah.

18:43.288 --> 18:47.626
Well, fuck it. I'm not getting you the item
to only get popped.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.754
Well, then it would appear
we are upon the horns of a dilemma.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.342
Look, you're just wasting time.
I'm sure the Italians are on their way.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.552
Ilya?

18:56.677 --> 18:58.512
OK, I'll get it. All right.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.391
But she comes with. You stay.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.226
She... She comes with?

19:04.351 --> 19:07.146
Yeah, yeah,
she comes with me, but, uh...

19:07.271 --> 19:08.647
no weapons.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.482
Kenny, look at her.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.818
She could kill you
with her bare hands.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.946
Well, I would just feel more comfortable
if she came with me and you waited here.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.288
Suit yourself.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.457
All right.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.926
All right, so which one is it?
There's a million of 'em.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.180
I'm thinking it's the one up there
with the door open.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.898
Nuh-uh-uh. All of them.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.316
Tsssk!

19:55.360 --> 19:56.820
All right, take off your coat.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.535
All right, turn around.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.579
There, are you happy now?

20:06.079 --> 20:08.207
- Actually, I'm not.
- Oh, my!

20:08.332 --> 20:11.710
She could still snap your neck like a twig.
Now get moving!

20:18.550 --> 20:21.261
- OK, what now?
- Easy. Pull inside.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.980
- Fuck!
- Stop the fucking car!

20:32.105 --> 20:34.191
Stop the fucking car!
Don't go any further!

20:40.322 --> 20:41.448
I'm sorry, friend!
We, uh...

20:41.573 --> 20:43.575
we have this place
for the next couple of hours.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.702
Maybe I'll just pick up a little something
that belongs to me

20:45.827 --> 20:47.246
and be on my way, then.
How's that sound?

20:47.371 --> 20:50.207
I am not sure that's
going to be possible.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.625
- Kenny.
- Hi!

20:51.750 --> 20:53.752
- You motherfucker!
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

20:53.877 --> 20:55.379
- Be cool, man!
- One more move!

20:55.504 --> 20:57.339
This fucker's mine, all right?
Now back the fuck down!

20:57.464 --> 21:00.217
I think that is going
to be a problem.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.310
Hey, you.
Mr. uh... Potty Mouth.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.564
Let's say you and me, we have
a little, uh, powwow, hmm?

21:16.400 --> 21:17.484
Lose the gun.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.736
OK.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.126
I mean, what would have been better?
A KO from a steak

21:34.251 --> 21:35.335
or two in the head
from a robber?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.212
- It was a tenderloin.
- Whatever.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.548
You know what he means.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.300
Now the only thing
I'm shooting at is paper.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.135
At least we can have some fun.
Hit the siren.

21:47.389 --> 21:51.601
- Are you happy now?
- Yeah, I like the sirens.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.650
Look, I don't know
who the fuck you are...

21:58.775 --> 22:01.028
but that son of a bitch stole something
that belongs to me

22:01.153 --> 22:02.321
and I want his ass now.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.198
I'm sorry, you cannot have
that son of a bitch.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.827
- And why the fuck not?
- He's my business associate.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.454
Yeah.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.497
Your business associate, huh?

22:15.459 --> 22:17.252
It's here, isn't it?

22:18.128 --> 22:19.463
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.173
Oh, yes, you do.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.175
You're a really bad fucking liar.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.885
What did you say?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.762
Allow me to clarify.

22:26.887 --> 22:31.350
How would you like my size 12
all up in your ass.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.603
I am sorry, I am trying to quit having things
shoved all in my ass.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.483
Oh fuck.
It's the fucking cops.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.113
You brought the fucking cops
with you?

22:45.238 --> 22:47.366
I didn't bring the fucking cops with me!
You brought the fucking cops!

22:47.491 --> 22:49.076
Who the fuck did?
Kenny, I swear to God,

22:49.201 --> 22:51.370
if you brought the fucking cops here
I will rip off your balls

22:51.495 --> 22:53.330
and I will shove them up your ass!

22:56.500 --> 22:58.377
- Fuck.
- OK!

22:58.502 --> 23:00.712
- We need to lay low.
- Fuck that shit. I ain't laying low here.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.506
- What do we do?
- We get out of here right now.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.634
No! You cannot leave! They will see you
leaving. That will put us all in danger.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.262
All right, all right! G-Get in the fucking
back corner, all right?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.348
Maybe if we're lucky
they'll just drive by us, OK?

23:11.473 --> 23:12.391
- Do it!
- What?

23:12.516 --> 23:13.558
Ilya, fucking do it!

23:13.683 --> 23:14.893
Come on, get in the fucking car!

23:15.018 --> 23:16.853
Get the fucking cars back now!

23:41.169 --> 23:43.922
- Nice, real nice.
- You think?

23:44.047 --> 23:46.716
No need for damage control here.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.135
How we get stuck
with this dump?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.470
Came up when the jarheads moved out.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.722
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.063
No, no, no, Hunt. Daisy's got to
stay here this time.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.115
All right, believe it or not,

24:10.240 --> 24:13.285
our esteemed Chief has requested
I bring back the paper targets.

24:13.410 --> 24:18.540
Clearly indicating that we did not shoot, kill,
destroy, or decimate one single hostage.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.793
I intend to move quickly through this drill
and keep it short and sweet.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.129
But first, a demonstration.

24:24.254 --> 24:27.299
This beady-eyed fucker -
that's a bad guy.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.095
Hostage, hostage,
fucking bad guy. Got it?

24:32.220 --> 24:36.016
One more time.
Hostage, hostage, bad guy?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.894
- Bad guy, hostage, hostage.
- I'm sorry, I...

24:39.019 --> 24:41.062
I want a demonstration,
one more.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.989
Fuck me. Sounds like
they stopped outside.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.033
Yeah, the van stopped,
that's for sure.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.993
I thought you said
they would drive by.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.328
How the fuck was
I supposed to know?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.622
I said, if we're lucky
they might drive by.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.625
Apparently, we ain't so lucky.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.547
- All right, you all got it?
- Yup.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.799
- Yup.
- Where's the frozen-food aisle?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.802
Move out, stack up
on that door.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.514
We better get goin'.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.850
He's gonna shoot me
before this is over.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.264
How you doing back there?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.683
Lonely.

26:43.226 --> 26:47.897
So, anything else I should know
about this place?

26:48.023 --> 26:48.940
Like what?

26:49.065 --> 26:50.817
Who the fuck's upstairs
that the cops want?

26:50.942 --> 26:53.361
What the fuck is this place? Crime Central?

26:53.486 --> 26:56.740
Just calm down. Lay low.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.284
They just might pass us by.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.412
Don't get too comfortable, Vladi,
'cause I ain't done with you after they leave.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.372
OK, so save it for then.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.959
'Cause no one is doing anything
until they are gone.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.124
- You flippin' maggot.
- Who, me?

27:48.249 --> 27:50.377
Yeah, you.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.088
If I get outta here alive,
I'm gonna make damn sure you don't.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.552
So is that suit like
a poly-cotton blend or -?

27:59.678 --> 28:02.305
- Don't fucking touch me, man!
- Shut the fuck up!

28:03.640 --> 28:06.267
Be ready, in case they decide
to sweep the building.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.862
All right, folks, I thought that was
a pretty good run.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.906
Jannard, you're a little slow
on phase two.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.533
Need to cover our exit
a little bit better.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.784
Move your ass, bitch.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.661
Yo, that was Blanco
bringing up the rear.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.287
- D'you wanna run this again?
- What?

28:26.413 --> 28:27.706
Yup, let's change it up this time.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.416
Let's take five and then
we'll get back to it.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.919
They just shot the shit
out of somebody up there.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.972
Hey, uh, gorgeous, what do you say
when this thing is all over, you and I,

28:44.097 --> 28:46.516
- we can get together, we can -
- I'd rather die.

28:49.686 --> 28:53.064
Die? Hey, baby, I would crawl
a mile through broken glass

28:53.189 --> 28:55.191
just to eat the peanuts
out of your shit.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.944
Hey, OK, all right, sorry,
that wasn't cool.

28:58.069 --> 29:01.781
I'm just, you know... I'm just trying to, like,
levitate the situation, is all.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.160
How about that corner over there?

29:05.285 --> 29:07.829
No, let's not go there.
We'll call that out of bounds.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.373
Let's come around the reverse way this time
into that other section.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.753
- Hey, would you look at that?
- What?

29:14.878 --> 29:17.672
Your eyes, they're so beautiful.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.383
- Do you got any Italian in you?
- No!

29:22.010 --> 29:23.011
You want some?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.015
Oh shit.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.401
I thought we had this joint
to ourselves.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.112
You fucking bitch!
I'll teach you some manners.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.198
Enough of this, God damn it!
Both of you!

29:45.241 --> 29:48.453
Blanco, go tell whoever's down there
this place is off limits until two.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.913
Copy that.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.123
Next time, tell the Chief
not to double-book us.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.416
Duly noted. Move out.

29:53.541 --> 29:56.169
'Cause I'm about
to shoot somebody.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.758
Come on! I love it!

30:02.425 --> 30:04.052
Huh!

30:05.345 --> 30:06.346
OK, all right, all right.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.181
Kenny, I will shoot your ass
through ten times

30:08.306 --> 30:09.641
before you fucking escape,
you hear me?

30:09.766 --> 30:11.100
I don't give a damn
who hears me.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.770
- Stop it! Damn it!
- Creep!

30:14.729 --> 30:16.397
Fucking rotten bitch.

30:16.523 --> 30:20.276
Say one more word.
Anything, I dare you.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.863
I'd rather go to jail for life than hear you
say one more fucking word.

30:23.988 --> 30:27.200
Enough already! Fuck!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:27.325 --> 30:29.953
We got an entire
SWAT team upstairs.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.288
Not the time.
So not the fucking time.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.168
Now, you better
hope to God...

30:37.293 --> 30:40.129
that they didn't hear your little
"wake the dead" shit just now, all right?

30:40.255 --> 30:43.258
Now, all of you,
just stand the fuck down

30:43.383 --> 30:47.095
and go back to your corners until
this whole thing blows over, all right?

30:48.054 --> 30:49.222
All right?

30:49.347 --> 30:51.099
I feel so scolded.

30:51.224 --> 30:53.184
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hello?

30:53.309 --> 30:54.769
Oh shit.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.651
Hello?

31:08.324 --> 31:09.576
Hello?

31:15.039 --> 31:16.666
Put the silencer on.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.220
Hey!

31:30.597 --> 31:32.599
Whoever's there,
you gotta move this shit.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.733
What the fuck?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.318
Hey...

31:46.195 --> 31:47.196
Fuck.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.246
That's how it's done.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.040
Now, that is sexy.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.880
- Oh, my God.
- Jeez!

32:04.005 --> 32:05.757
Hey, I didn't know
he was gonna shoot.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.927
He's wearing a vest, you stupid fuck.
Now we're all dead.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.263
Wow, you must be, like,
the professional, or something.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.223
Precision is your specialty.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.313
That's enough from you.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.569
As for the rest of ya'll,
prepare for a fire fight.

32:27.403 --> 32:28.488
Let's do it.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.908
Uh, I have a nose bleed.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.174
What now?

32:48.299 --> 32:49.634
Yeah, what now?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.185
Simunition.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.401
Simunition.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.237
Simunition?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.613
What the fuck is that?

33:10.738 --> 33:13.408
Not fucking bullets.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.051
Got the same thing here.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.178
Hold on a second. Why would he
be carrying a gun with no bullets?

33:34.303 --> 33:36.389
They're training, dumb fuck.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.807
- With blanks?
- Not blanks.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.726
Paintball training rounds.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.521
Well, that changes
everything now, doesn't it?

33:43.646 --> 33:45.023
I say we kill them all.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.442
We just killed a policeman,

33:47.567 --> 33:49.193
and the only people who can
do anything about it

33:49.318 --> 33:50.611
are firing blanks.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.947
I don't see any other way
out of this cluster fuck.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.532
You can't be serious.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.160
You got any other ideas?
We got a dead cop -

33:57.285 --> 33:58.369
Quiet.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.337
Showtime.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.716
Yo, man! Where you at?

34:11.841 --> 34:14.260
Blanco, quit fucking the dog!

34:14.844 --> 34:16.137
Yo, Blanco!

34:17.179 --> 34:19.306
Blanco, you OK?

34:19.431 --> 34:21.601
I'm afraid not.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.976
Freeze!

34:25.146 --> 34:27.231
Put your hands where
I can see 'em. This is LAPD.

34:27.356 --> 34:30.234
- Put the gun down!
- OK, I don't think so.

34:30.359 --> 34:33.237
So, uh, let me explain how
this is all going to go down, huh?

34:33.362 --> 34:35.697
On your knees, asshole!

34:35.822 --> 34:39.702
Very convincing. Almost, er,
like it was, sort of, Cops.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.996
One of my favorite shows
I watch in syndication.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.415
I especially like the part
where they all burst in, all angry,

34:44.540 --> 34:46.250
yelling "Get up! Get down! "

34:46.375 --> 34:48.377
Dogs barking, very confusing.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.967
Fuck you!

34:55.092 --> 34:56.803
That's pretty.

34:56.928 --> 35:01.140
Now, unless this is
the new humane LAPD...

35:01.265 --> 35:04.727
I'm gonna take a wild guess that you clowns
got your training wheels on today.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.604
Am I right or am I right?

35:06.729 --> 35:08.439
So I'm gonna explain how
this is gonna go down.

35:08.564 --> 35:12.235
You see, we accidentally knocked off
your partner here and, uh...

35:12.360 --> 35:14.612
I know that y'all gonna be
real pissed about that.

35:14.737 --> 35:17.406
Hell, I know I'd be pissed. Shit.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.784
See, that leaves us
with a little bit of a problem.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.955
I can't let y'all go without, uh,
compromising my own security.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.207
Can't do nothing down here.

35:26.332 --> 35:29.418
On my mark,
fly back through those doors.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.381
- You're gonna have to die.
- Now!

35:40.263 --> 35:41.472
Fuck!

35:41.597 --> 35:44.308
Where the fuck did this
fucking door come from?

35:44.433 --> 35:46.686
Ilya, go around back,
cut off their exit!

35:46.811 --> 35:48.813
Storato, go with her!

35:48.938 --> 35:51.107
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is this shit?

35:51.232 --> 35:53.025
What the fuck
just happened?

35:53.943 --> 35:55.278
Blanco's dead.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.281
Who are these guys?

35:58.406 --> 36:00.825
They're fucking dead,
I promise you that.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.577
Let's move out and get help.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.333
Let's see if we can see
the truck from here.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.007
Get down!

36:32.857 --> 36:35.985
Where's the fucking case, Kenny? Huh?

36:36.110 --> 36:38.696
That's why I'm here,
that's why he's here

36:38.821 --> 36:40.489
and that's why you're here.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.701
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

36:43.826 --> 36:47.288
where is the fucking case?!

36:48.539 --> 36:49.707
Huh?

36:49.832 --> 36:53.211
- Where's the fucking case?
- What case?

36:53.336 --> 36:56.505
- Get the fucking case, Kenny!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:56.631 --> 36:59.383
Abu Ghraib, he can't
talk if he's dead, huh?

36:59.508 --> 37:00.885
Well, if he hadn't
stole it from me...

37:01.010 --> 37:03.054
He didn't steal it from you.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.222
I stole it from you.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.933
- What'd you say?
- I stole it from you.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.643
And he stole it from me.

37:10.019 --> 37:13.397
Motherfuck. I ought to
shoot your ass right now.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.733
Before you get all pious,
ask yourself, uh,

37:15.858 --> 37:17.360
who you stole it from?

37:19.904 --> 37:22.740
That's none of
your damn business.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.534
Kenny, where is
the fucking case?

37:29.705 --> 37:30.998
It's in there.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.378
- Oh fuck.
- You're fucking kidding me.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.463
We need to get
some people on this.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.927
All right, here's what we know.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.513
The door we just came
through is the only exit.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.598
We gotta get
to the truck.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.558
I can see the truck from here.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.936
Looks like 30 feet down.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.105
Hey, got a couple
dozen feet of paracord?

37:54.230 --> 37:55.606
We're effectively unarmed.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.484
Anyone got a phone?

37:58.609 --> 38:00.236
In the truck.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.570
- Any live ammo?
- Truck.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.906
Everything's in
the fucking truck.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.783
How many grenades
you got there?

38:05.908 --> 38:07.618
A couple flashbangs.

38:07.743 --> 38:10.121
- Concussions?
- Negative.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.123
All right, that's a shitty start.

38:12.248 --> 38:15.918
- And this shit's fucking useless.
- What do you wanna do?

38:16.043 --> 38:18.963
We're gonna do what we always do -
take care of business.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.798
Boss, we're surrounded.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.967
That's bad news for them.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.597
What the fuck is
taking them so long?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.016
Relax.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.727
Little buddies upstairs
ain't going nowhere.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.603
And, thanks to Kenny,
neither are we.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.148
You know, you should really
try some breathing exercises

38:37.273 --> 38:39.025
for your stress relief
or something.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.818
You know,
just by looking at you,

38:40.943 --> 38:42.695
I can tell that your blood pressure
is probably through the roof

38:42.820 --> 38:45.698
and your arteries are as hard as the secret
hard-on that you carry in your pants for me.

38:45.823 --> 38:49.327
- Shut the fuck up!
- OK, no more beating of Kenny. OK?

38:49.452 --> 38:52.371
When we find item, then...
then you go to town.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.081
No, that's all right,
I forgive him.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.584
He's Italian,
he's born that way.

38:56.709 --> 38:59.003
- What?
- Yeah, it's an Italian thing.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.005
He's got this whole built-in
inner rage thing going.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.049
I think I read somewhere
that it's genetic.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.801
Italians are known to be very volatile,
kind of like Mount Vesuvius,

39:05.926 --> 39:08.679
or maybe it's more like Mount Etna, since
Vesuvius hasn't erupted since Pompeii.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.431
Either way,
I gotta take a piss.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.641
You want to see Vesuvius?
Huh? Huh?

39:12.767 --> 39:14.352
I'll show you Vesuvius,
motherfucker.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.062
Are you saying this man
is actually Italian?

39:16.187 --> 39:19.523
- Yeah.
- What?

39:19.648 --> 39:22.860
I am saying,
do you own a mirror?

39:22.985 --> 39:25.404
A black man can't be from Italy? Huh?

39:25.529 --> 39:27.990
I was born in Rome, bitch. Rome.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.785
You obviously ain't heard
of Kobe Bryant.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.411
Yes, you're right,
I- I believe it.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.914
You have taught me many things today.
I appreciate that.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.708
Perhaps we should become
Facebook friends, yeah?

39:37.833 --> 39:40.127
I'm on Facebook.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.048
Ah! There she is.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.520
Yeah, Red Leader! This is
Piggy Leader, do you copy?

39:58.896 --> 40:01.065
You're not gonna be
needing this anymore!

40:02.400 --> 40:03.401
Huh, gorgeous?

40:09.198 --> 40:11.700
Oh, check it out!

40:13.077 --> 40:14.745
Hey, Captain!

40:14.870 --> 40:16.539
Live.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.749
There are four
cell phones here.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.423
All of their live ammo is here too.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.633
What the fuck?

40:27.758 --> 40:30.553
Backup ain't coming for these guys.
That's for damn sure.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.557
No, but it is here for us.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.151
Hey, Demetrius.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.321
- How's your mother?
- She is well.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.449
She asks about you
all the time.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.369
There she is. Ha!

40:55.494 --> 40:58.038
Enough of the fucking
family reunion.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.125
Can we get on with
this shit already?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.585
Who is this pista?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.920
We'll explain later.
Come.

41:09.925 --> 41:11.760
What do you want
to do now?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.181
Make a call.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.434
What you think?

41:18.559 --> 41:20.394
They are armored
blast doors, Demetrius.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.771
Is not designed for security.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.732
Cut off steel plate,

41:24.857 --> 41:26.775
door falls like
former Soviet Union.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.904
- Can you do it?
- Sure.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.655
Take a couple of hours.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.616
No, that's
too much time.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.665
They're gone,
and so is the truck.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.501
Fuck.

41:43.626 --> 41:47.171
- So what's the new plan?
- It's a classic siege.

41:47.296 --> 41:51.717
They got the truck. They know damn well
we got no communication, no live ammo.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.303
All they have to do is wait.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.138
We gotta get the fuck
out of this building, ASAP.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.264
This way much easier.

41:57.389 --> 41:59.016
Put up ladders,
climb in windows,

41:59.141 --> 42:01.435
take out all resistance.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.645
Do it.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.563
Potential for casualties
is much higher.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.982
They may resist our
charge up the ladder.

42:07.107 --> 42:10.319
I assure you...
they are unarmed.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.698
They called in backup.
They're coming up?

42:14.823 --> 42:17.201
Well, think about it, what's the easiest way
to get up here?

42:17.326 --> 42:19.912
You gonna waste your time on those doors?
It would take too long.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.997
All they need to do is lay down
some suppress fire,

42:22.122 --> 42:23.541
pop a ladder up,
and get two guys in here

42:23.666 --> 42:25.459
and boom, we're done.

42:25.584 --> 42:27.169
So what's the plan?

42:29.838 --> 42:31.382
I got something for their ass.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.677
We cannot waste
any more time.

42:34.802 --> 42:38.430
We must send Vladimir
and his men up and put them down.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.599
Oh, these guys are making me
nervous, man.

42:40.724 --> 42:44.436
- Yeah, no shit.
- We are seriously outgunned here.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.772
Who the fuck do you think is gonna get
that case when we get in there?

42:46.897 --> 42:47.940
It's not gonna be us.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.817
That's why I called in our man.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.610
When the fuck is he
gonna be here?

42:51.735 --> 42:54.029
Soon.

42:54.154 --> 42:57.449
Let our little friends here
waste their men getting in there.

42:57.575 --> 43:01.829
We have Kenny,
and he knows where the case is.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.914
Right now, we need
all the help we can get.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.291
As soon as they are in,

43:05.416 --> 43:07.793
poof, they all disappear.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.592
So that's all you're gonna say?

43:14.717 --> 43:16.427
"I got something for their ass. "

43:16.552 --> 43:17.761
Care to give me
the whole plan?

43:17.886 --> 43:19.138
No.

43:22.224 --> 43:24.310
- Demetrius, we're ready.
- Good.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.145
I leave it to you, then.

43:29.023 --> 43:31.150
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.776
Who's watching Kenny?

43:32.901 --> 43:35.613
Well, one of these guys will be,
after they boost him up.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.532
It's not a problem.
I tied him to the truck myself.

43:40.242 --> 43:41.410
Good.

43:46.915 --> 43:48.792
All right, I want you to lock
the door behind me.

43:48.917 --> 43:49.918
What?

43:50.044 --> 43:51.962
Just do it, God damn it.
We don't have all day.

44:02.556 --> 44:03.682
Come on.

44:12.608 --> 44:13.984
Well, why the fuck
ain't they shooting, man?

44:14.109 --> 44:16.070
I don't know,
maybe they are hiding.

44:37.424 --> 44:40.094
- What is he doing?
- I have no fucking idea.

44:42.596 --> 44:45.140
- What the fuck?
- I'll go check it out.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.518
- No, no, no! Hey!
- You gotta cover the door.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.442
Pay attention.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.194
They could be anywhere.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.998
I'm good. I'm good.

45:12.918 --> 45:15.129
Argh!

45:18.882 --> 45:20.384
Stay down!

45:26.765 --> 45:28.100
Nice suit.

45:29.184 --> 45:30.853
Thank you.

45:33.021 --> 45:35.524
- I swear I heard two shots.
- I did not hear anything.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.450
Who the fuck are you?

46:21.653 --> 46:23.280
Hey, those guys -

46:23.405 --> 46:25.616
Get out of
the way!

46:25.741 --> 46:27.743
- They kidnapped me.
- Sit down!

46:27.868 --> 46:29.536
They're gonna kill me, all right?

46:40.214 --> 46:42.508
There they are.
They're coming!

46:50.265 --> 46:52.476
Kenny! What -?
Take 'em down!

46:54.937 --> 46:58.065
- Kenny, you cockroach!
- Shoot them!

46:58.190 --> 46:59.983
Hey! open up!

47:00.108 --> 47:01.777
- Open up!
- Open the door!

47:06.281 --> 47:08.200
Aargh!

47:14.623 --> 47:16.124
Fuck me!

47:19.086 --> 47:20.128
Fuck!

47:31.723 --> 47:32.724
Shit.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.774
- Where's Jannard?
- Upstairs.

47:42.150 --> 47:44.027
Who's this guy?

47:44.152 --> 47:45.529
I'm Kenny.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.990
Argh!

47:55.622 --> 47:57.875
Send a bitch to do a man's job.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.013
You're right, they did send
a bitch to do a man's job.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.778
Oh shit.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.822
Do something, do something.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.992
Excuse me,
do you speak English?

48:54.473 --> 48:56.266
Is he dead?

48:56.391 --> 48:58.143
What do you think?

48:58.268 --> 48:59.937
Stop.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.563
Get up the stairs.

49:16.244 --> 49:17.287
Bitch.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.798
You know, it was your armpit
that killed him.

49:27.923 --> 49:30.842
Bruce Lee would have been
proud of that shit.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.844
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- You all right?

49:32.970 --> 49:34.554
Uh-huh.
Thanks, boss.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.223
Kenny!

49:37.307 --> 49:38.976
Kenny!

49:39.101 --> 49:42.396
You've eaten your last meal,
motherfucker! You hear me?

49:42.521 --> 49:44.189
It's bedtime for you, man!

49:46.775 --> 49:51.321
This is the last time I've been duped
by that motherfucker. You hear me?

49:51.446 --> 49:52.823
Yo, why wasn't he guarded?

49:52.948 --> 49:55.158
We were outside
planning the assault

49:55.283 --> 49:58.161
while your man was supposed to be
in here guarding him,

49:58.286 --> 50:00.998
the truck, and those fucking doors!

50:01.123 --> 50:02.541
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

50:02.666 --> 50:04.459
Well, fuck you, man!

50:04.584 --> 50:07.004
You want a job done,
you gotta do it your fucking self.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.046
You do it, then.

50:08.171 --> 50:09.715
Let's get the fuck over here, man.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.675
Let's get the fuck
over here.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.011
I can't believe this, man.
What amateurs.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.471
- Relax, take it easy...
- Do it.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.374
Well, hello.

50:48.045 --> 50:51.381
It's about time, man.
I was beginning to think you got lost.

50:51.506 --> 50:53.467
Lost? I don't think so.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.595
You need me for something?

50:59.973 --> 51:02.851
Because if boss over there
ain't doing his job, you know, uh...

51:02.976 --> 51:05.312
you know where you can
get your next meal.

51:05.437 --> 51:08.273
- So who is this?
- I don't know.

51:08.398 --> 51:12.027
Let's just hope this coalition
holds together a little while longer.

51:15.155 --> 51:16.281
Back to square fucking one.

51:16.406 --> 51:18.617
Well, shit, we're armed now.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.702
Who the fuck is that?

51:20.827 --> 51:23.955
I don't know who the fuck he is.
Found him tied up in our truck.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.040
You call for help?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.084
No. Radio's busted.

51:27.209 --> 51:28.710
No phones, no keys.

51:28.835 --> 51:30.420
Well, at least we stand
a fighting chance now.

51:30.545 --> 51:34.674
Right. All right, I want all the equipment
stripped off those bodies.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.593
Anything we can use,
put it here.

51:36.718 --> 51:37.844
Search everything.

51:37.969 --> 51:40.222
Somebody's gotta have
a goddamn phone. Got it?

51:40.347 --> 51:41.348
- Got it.
- OK.

51:41.473 --> 51:42.682
Move out.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.187
Who the fuck you
say you were?

51:53.401 --> 51:55.195
Freeze, motherfucker.

51:55.320 --> 51:59.199
You make one sudden move
and I will totally fuck up a real nice suit.

51:59.324 --> 52:00.325
Stand up.

52:05.247 --> 52:07.791
Turn around. Slowly.

52:12.254 --> 52:14.631
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

52:14.756 --> 52:16.174
What the fuck is that?

52:20.428 --> 52:22.305
It's what they're here for.

52:24.349 --> 52:25.433
Set it down.

52:27.269 --> 52:28.520
Easy.

52:33.692 --> 52:34.901
All right.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.071
Kick it over here.

52:44.202 --> 52:45.954
I wouldn't do that.

52:48.957 --> 52:51.751
Holy shit.
Put your fucking hands up.

52:52.794 --> 52:54.129
Wait...

52:54.254 --> 52:55.964
Stand over here,
don't fucking move.

52:56.089 --> 52:58.091
OK, just wait, all right?

52:58.216 --> 53:01.636
Just give me a second, OK?
You guys are making a big mistake here.

53:01.761 --> 53:04.389
You're all gonna fucking die
if you don't listen to me.

53:04.514 --> 53:07.642
- This is what he was carrying right here.
- Oh shit.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.936
This changes everything.

53:10.061 --> 53:12.355
What did we recover?
A couple more rifles,

53:12.480 --> 53:14.524
two pistols, a dozen magazines.

53:14.649 --> 53:17.360
- Any comms, phones, anything?
- Negative.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.863
Motherfuckers are smarter
than I thought.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.365
Maybe we can use that
to bargain with these guys.

53:22.490 --> 53:24.743
Do we want to negotiate
with these fucks?

53:34.002 --> 53:37.714
- What do we got?
- Three cops, SWAT, armed.

53:37.839 --> 53:40.091
- Up in there.
- Oh, and Kenny.

53:40.217 --> 53:42.135
Yeah, bring me that fucker alive.

53:43.553 --> 53:44.888
How you gonna get in?

53:47.724 --> 53:49.392
I'll figure it out.

53:51.686 --> 53:53.688
All right, the good news is,
we have what they want.

53:53.813 --> 53:55.732
Bad news is,
we don't have no firepower.

53:55.857 --> 53:58.318
That being said,
you guys grab the M4s,

53:58.443 --> 54:00.362
- I'll take the -
- You're wasting your time here, OK?

54:00.487 --> 54:02.447
Shut up!

54:02.572 --> 54:04.866
We can't hold 'em off forever,
but we can hold 'em off for another round.

54:04.991 --> 54:07.035
Hey! I know another
way outta here,

54:07.160 --> 54:10.038
and I'll show you if you would just
listen to me for five seconds, OK?

54:12.540 --> 54:14.793
What other choice
do you have, huh?

54:19.214 --> 54:20.507
Tie that fucker up.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.094
Ah, fuck.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.828
Ain't nothing here
but a dead end.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.997
You're wasting my time.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.873
More importantly,
you're pissing me off.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.459
Yeah, I have that effect on people.

54:56.584 --> 54:58.586
Look under the tarp.

54:58.712 --> 55:00.171
Check it out.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.319
Where does it go?

55:22.444 --> 55:24.070
Away from here.

55:24.195 --> 55:25.822
More specific, fucker.

55:25.947 --> 55:28.241
Can you read?
It says right there - crash building.

55:28.366 --> 55:29.492
About half a mile
away from here.

55:29.617 --> 55:32.037
From there, there's a way
to the outside.

55:32.162 --> 55:35.915
Yeah? How do we know you're not
gonna lead us directly to them?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.208
We don't.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.336
Beats standing
around here, though.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.631
All right. Untie me.

56:01.274 --> 56:03.151
- Bravo.
- Shut up. Shut up.

56:03.276 --> 56:05.528
Go get my guys over here
and be quiet.

56:05.653 --> 56:06.905
Hey, guys.

56:12.660 --> 56:14.162
Man's a ninja.

56:38.478 --> 56:39.771
Ladies first.

57:46.421 --> 57:47.630
Which way?

57:49.090 --> 57:50.884
This way.

57:51.009 --> 57:53.136
I think. I don't know.
Uh, it's been a long time.

57:53.261 --> 57:54.137
I don't remember.

57:54.262 --> 57:55.638
- How do you know this?
- What?

57:55.763 --> 57:58.600
Uh, I was stationed here.
Come on, let's go.

58:04.272 --> 58:06.191
Get them in there now.

58:16.951 --> 58:18.369
Hold up.

58:20.622 --> 58:22.499
What is it?

58:22.624 --> 58:24.417
I heard
something.

58:24.542 --> 58:26.711
- Where?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

58:27.879 --> 58:29.297
Back there.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.302
All right, take him up ahead,
I'll check it out.

58:34.427 --> 58:37.931
- All right, let's go.
- Watch that motherfucker.

58:49.234 --> 58:52.195
Come on, boys, let's go, go, go!
Get the fuck in the hole.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.448
And Kenny comes back to me alive,
you hear me? Alive.

58:56.658 --> 58:58.910
I'll deal with that
little weasel myself.

59:10.421 --> 59:12.632
All right, it's just up ahead.

59:12.757 --> 59:14.801
We turn right, it's a dead end.
From there, there's a ladder

59:14.926 --> 59:17.011
that leads up
to the crash building.

59:38.074 --> 59:39.826
Don't move.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.953
You're surrounded,
front and back.

59:43.079 --> 59:46.541
Now drop all your hardware,
nice and slow.

59:49.669 --> 59:51.671
I said drop 'em.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.971
You got the jump on me
this time, sunshine.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.390
- Ain't gonna happen again.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.900
I will have need of your services
in the future.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.736
I only work for the family.

01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:16.613
Where are the rest of them?

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:19.073
Down the tunnel,
in the crash room.

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:20.325
OK.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.287
Ilya, off this cop.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.998
- It's too bad.
- It is too bad for you.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:30.418
Too bad you're not gonna get your hands
on that fucking case.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.921
What do you know about that?

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.091
I know Kenny
doesn't have it anymore.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.148
Get the fuck out.

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:55.318
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.654
Welcome to the party,
welcome to the party.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.989
Hey, man.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.243
This is mine! Ha!

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:05.620
Whoo!

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:10.833
- I believe somebody's missing.
- I left him with the Russians.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.003
Hmm.

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:15.338
Fuck it.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:16.923
I got all I need right here.

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:20.051
What d'you say
we get out of here, huh?

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.472
What you got to say about that?

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.725
Fuck you?

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.060
Fuck me?

01:01:31.145 --> 01:01:34.399
Let me explain
something to you...brah.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:37.652
A little primer for where
we stand right about now.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.822
See, I'm gonna go home,
have a big fucking steak

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.574
and a nice piece of ass.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.952
Then, I'm gonna soak
in the Jacuzzi

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.287
till I forget today
ever happened.

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.915
As for you, my friend,

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.543
you're going for a bullet to the head,
followed by a shallow grave.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:56.504
You feel me? Huh?

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:58.381
What you got to say
about that?

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.174
Sounds like you got it
all figured out.

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:02.009
Yeah.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.678
Except one thing.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.848
Oh, what did I forget about? Hm?

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:10.017
Look in the case.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:14.897
The case.

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.032
Fuck!

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:30.037
Where is it?

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:35.209
Where is it?!

01:02:43.384 --> 01:02:44.969
He's bluffing.

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.929
Call him yourself, bitch.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.230
Hello?

01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:58.399
- Where is it, man?
- Where is what?

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:00.526
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't fuck with me, man!

01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:03.780
You know exactly
what the fuck I'm talking about.

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:07.116
The item is not
in the fucking case.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:16.250
I want every Russian dead on
this base, you understand me?

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:17.919
- It's done.
- Make it happen.

01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:25.551
- Where's the item?
- I...

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:28.805
And don't-don't...don't bullshit me
anymore, man,

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.682
'cause I'm... I'm kinda topped off today,
you know what I'm saying?

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:35.019
I'm real out there right now,
and all I want...

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:37.522
I just want the fucking item!

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.940
All right, it...

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.442
it was in the case not half an hour ago,
I swear.

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:46.155
OK, OK...

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.448
Really?

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.327
It was in the case,
I swear -

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:52.954
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:56.666
- He's telling the truth.
- Is that right?

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.835
- Yeah.
- You're saying that this...

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.255
this maggot,
this lying piece of shit...

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.633
doesn't know the whereabouts of my
property? Is that what you're saying?

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:08.427
That's right. He doesn't know where it is.
My team leader took it.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:09.679
This guy has nothing
to do with it.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:10.972
Nothing, uh-uh.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.519
OK, let me...
let me get this straight,

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:19.021
'cause I'm a...
I'm a little dyslexic

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:22.567
and sometimes I need shit repeated
on the account that I...

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:27.363
sometimes don't process things on the
first pass. You know what I'm saying?

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:30.658
Kenny here, Kenny...
'cause that's your name, right?

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:32.285
- Yeah, Kenny.
- Kenny, yeah, see,

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:37.498
Kenny presently does not know
the whereabouts of my property, yes?

01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:41.377
- Yes.
- Yes, he knows where it is,

01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:43.087
or yes, he doesn't know?

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:45.715
No, he...
He doesn't know where it is.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.510
See, my brother?
I don't know where it is.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.062
He's no use to me, then, is he?

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:04.191
How about you,
Miss... Jannard?

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.195
What do you know?

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.198
OK, I make you a deal, erm...

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:13.618
You tell me location
of the item and, uh,

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.244
I let you go. Final offer.

01:05:15.369 --> 01:05:17.538
- What about my team?
- That is not up to me,

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:20.291
that is up to, er, Kobe Bryant
and his Italians.

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:23.461
Something tells me you've
lost your pull over them.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.176
I know where it is.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:33.471
Finally, somebody
knows something.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.264
That's great.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:37.266
- Isn't that great, Storato?
- Wonderful.

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:38.559
Yeah.

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:42.229
Except, uh, we got
a little problem, though.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.273
See, the problem we have now

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:47.568
is that you, my esteemed officer,

01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:51.614
you just saw me vaporize
Kenny's head here.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:55.409
And you know that
that just might happen to you.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.913
And you'll do whatever it takes

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.457
to save your own little bacon.

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:03.084
See, that's what I hate
about torture.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:07.088
When a man's in too much pain
and is too scared,

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:10.549
just wants it all to stop...

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:16.305
he'll say anything... anything...

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.974
to make it stop.

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:21.769
And a confession made
under duress is useless.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.856
As you are to me.

01:06:37.618 --> 01:06:39.161
We have to get to those doors.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.796
Listen to me very carefully.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:52.466
I am here to kill everybody
who draws breath.

01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:54.260
- Cut me loose, damn it.
- What?!

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:57.596
You're outnumbered without me.
Give me a gun, for fuck's sake.

01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:02.643
I can promise you one thing - you come out
from behind that van right now,

01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:06.355
I will quickly and painlessly
kill every last one of you.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.233
It'll be humane and you
won't feel a fucking thing.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.110
Give me a fucking gun.

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:13.070
If you decide to resist me,

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:17.783
- I will lay my hands upon you.
- Do it.

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:20.745
- Do it.
- I will kill you in the longest,

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.415
slowest, most painful way possible.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.375
Fuck me and I will kill you.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.670
I'll rip your goddamn guts out.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.297
Sounds like good deal.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.507
Sounds like
good deal!

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:35.551
All right, that's enough.
I know where it is.

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:36.802
I'll take you to it. Just let her go.

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:39.138
You wait your turn, partner.
I'm gonna get to you.

01:07:39.263 --> 01:07:41.015
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you kill her.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.225
Why not? Hmm?

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:45.895
You got something
better to do... Hunt?

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.230
Hey, I don't give a shit
about that item.

01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:49.565
I'll take you to it.

01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:57.406
Where is it?

01:07:57.531 --> 01:07:58.866
In the tunnel.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.126
You look like you're
telling me the truth.

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:10.878
That's because I am.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:14.924
OK.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.260
Go get it.
Storato, go with him.

01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:20.679
- Promise you won't kill her.
- Move!

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.104
When I get my hands
on that ebony Italian

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.689
I'm gonna squeeze
the fucking life out of him.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:33.109
- Me first.
- Of course.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.653
I have you cornered
and you're outgunned.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:40.282
You got 60 seconds, and it don't make
no difference to me, you're dead either way.

01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:43.035
Listen to me, this thing ain't armored.
When those guys unload,

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.787
they'll turn this thing into Swiss cheese
along with us behind it.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.456
That's if they don't light off
the gas tank first.

01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:49.625
45 seconds.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.792
What do you suggest?

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:52.586
Where are the keys
to the truck?

01:08:58.175 --> 01:08:59.844
30 seconds!

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:04.974
Yeah, get this piece of shit
outta here.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.892
I'm tired of the stink.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.273
Come on, Mike Hunt,
how much farther?

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:13.983
My name is Tony,

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.109
and it's right up there,
about 40 feet.

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.613
Then go and get it.
I'll stay here.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.285
And stay where
I can see you!

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.622
Five seconds!

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.876
Three seconds!

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.795
Two seconds!

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.673
One second!

01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:40.091
Shoot! Shoot, God damn it!

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:45.264
Fire!

01:09:56.817 --> 01:09:58.861
Get back in the van!

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:01.322
Go, move it!

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.232
Go ahead, toss it over.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:37.566
OK, I done my part.

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:39.401
Now, is your boss gonna
let my team go?

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:44.198
You know what? Knowing him,
I'm gonna say, uh, no. Fuck, no.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:45.616
Sorry, pal, life is tough.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:46.992
Even tougher
when you're stupid.

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:48.744
And a stupid cop
doesn't have a chance.

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:50.371
Now toss it over.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.594
- Get 'em off my back!
- llya!

01:11:32.913 --> 01:11:34.915
I hope you know
what you are doing!

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.054
What's taking
them so long?

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:27.134
Fuck you!

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.117
Does anybody carry
a cell phone anymore?

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.219
You move, you die.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.211
Drop it.

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:51.051
Well, well, well.

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:54.096
Looks like you got the upper hand
now, Mr. Policeman.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:56.306
Look what else I got.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.600
Too bad it's heading
for an evidence locker.

01:13:58.725 --> 01:14:00.894
Get your ass over here.
Move.

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.071
Now I really hope you know
what you are doing!

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:12.406
Hang on!

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:18.120
What the fuck?!

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:24.001
Hey, Tate, you made it.
Hey, drop it!

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.712
- We got bigger problems.
- Like what?

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.431
Come on!
Get 'em out of here!

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.067
Tate, got something in the truck
that might help us out.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.444
Please tell me it ain't Daisy.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:51.653
No, no, no. Cover me.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.043
Come on!

01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:11.673
What the fuck is that?

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:14.176
I call this one Martha,
after my grandma.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.512
M203 grenade launcher.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:18.388
When did we start issuing those?

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.515
Uh, we haven't.

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:25.354
Highly explosive round,
impact detonated.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:29.024
Five-meter kill,
15-meter casualty zone.

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:30.692
Well, shoot the goddamn thing!

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:32.569
I need a line.

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:33.612
All right.

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:35.948
Eat my grandma!

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.638
Ha! Yeah, boy!

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.558
Yes, very impressive.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:05.519
Now... drop the fucking gun.

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:13.402
OK, stop there, turn around.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.028
On your knees.

01:16:18.615 --> 01:16:20.993
Ilya, go get the beige Italian.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.246
Remind me not to save your ass
next time.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:25.998
You save your own as well.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:28.125
Now, who has item?

01:16:33.463 --> 01:16:36.425
All right, you got what you want.
Let us go, we'll call it even.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:39.303
Oh, I'm sorry, that is not the way it works
in my line of business.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.929
Just want to say something.
Can I say something?

01:16:41.054 --> 01:16:43.432
- Yeah, I think you just did.
- You're a fucking faggot.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:46.351
Just want to get that off my chest
before I check out.

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:50.272
Clever last words.
Ilya, off these fuckers.

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:54.151
You can't do it yourself?
Fucking Russian dope.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:57.738
Huh? Pussy?
Chickenshit motherfucker!

01:17:22.929 --> 01:17:24.598
Gunfire.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.313
Gunfire.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.651
Oy!

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:42.783
Yeah.
There you are.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.660
Was just about
to send for you.

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:47.454
I'll take that,
fuck you very much.

01:17:53.126 --> 01:17:55.128
Do I have to tell you to kneel?

01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:02.928
Now... it's been fun...

01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:05.931
but I gots to go...

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:08.433
and y'all got to die.

01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:10.769
And like you, faggot, I'm gonna have
my man do the honors.

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:12.688
Wait.

01:18:14.314 --> 01:18:15.857
What?

01:18:15.982 --> 01:18:18.694
Remember that speech back in the hangar
about killing us all humanely?

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.613
- What of it?
- I got a last request.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.994
Do I look like the type
to grant a last request?

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:31.832
All right, make it quick.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:33.959
I gotta get home to the kids.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.883
- Yo! Uh-uh-uh!
- It's cool man, it's cool.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.886
What the fuck?

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:51.727
Earplugs. Allow me and my team
to wear them. It's my last request.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:55.397
You're worried about your hearing
at this point?

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:58.024
Safety first, all the way to the end, huh?
Good boy.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.026
You do realize that
where you're going

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:03.447
you don't have to worry about your hearing,
right? I'm-I'm just saying.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.907
Whatever, man,
do your thing.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.875
Oh shit!

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:37.481
You can run
but you can't hide, sunshine.

01:20:33.119 --> 01:20:34.788
Come on, motherfucker.

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:48.134
Time to die, pig.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.123
Told you, motherfucker.

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:18.558
Man, the Chief is gonna shit.

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:24.773
What are you guys gonna do
with the rest of your lives?

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:28.026
Well, I've been hanging
to do a little river fishing.

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:30.820
Probably a campus security job
opening somewhere.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.155
Yeah.

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.243
Yeah, I hear they're looking for security
at the galleria.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.286
Hmm?

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:40.622
- You know, mall.
- Hmm.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:45.335
This ain't over, fuckers!
I'll see you dead - all three of y'all.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.003
Don't sleep.

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:50.423
I just want to say, for the record,
I am not with this man.

01:22:50.548 --> 01:22:51.967
Shut the fuck up.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.343
Hey, aren't those the guys

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.471
who were reaching for their gun
and got themselves shot?

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:07.941
Mayor says the city is thinking of
throwing a parade in your honor.

01:23:09.609 --> 01:23:11.528
In memory of Blanco, as well.

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:15.824
I don't think I need to tell you

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:19.160
how important a find
the contents of that case were,

01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:20.829
and the fact that it's
off the streets for good.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:23.498
Thank you, sir.
It's an honor to serve.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.668
There's one problem, though.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.920
What's that?

01:23:31.464 --> 01:23:33.675
Is he on his way?

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.843
Good.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.847
Got a complaint from the Feds.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.640
They say you roughed up
one of their agents.

01:23:40.765 --> 01:23:44.394
That classroom instructor?
Sir, that guy was a clown.

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.730
He didn't know the first thing
about SWAT operations.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.773
Seriously, Chief,
the guy was a blowhard.

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:50.942
I can vouch for that,
he was a total blowhard.

01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:52.485
Come in.

01:23:56.656 --> 01:23:59.492
- What the fuck?
- Hey, guys.

01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:00.827
Allow me
to introduce Agent -

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:03.288
- Kenny?
- No, no, no. Kenny is just my handle.

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:07.042
You guys don't have the security clearance
to get my real name.

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:09.669
- But I saw you die.
- No, no, no.

01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:12.881
You saw... what I wanted you to see.

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:15.675
You fucking morons.
You should have seen their faces.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.219
- I picked your brains out of my hair.
- Did you?

01:24:18.344 --> 01:24:20.013
What the hell's going on, Chief?

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:21.556
What's going on is that, once again,

01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:24.392
you cowboys are standing
on your own dicks.

01:24:24.517 --> 01:24:26.394
Except for you, Officer Jannard.

01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:29.314
It's physically impossible for you
to stand on your own.

01:24:29.439 --> 01:24:31.066
You gonna let me in on the deal,
whoever you are?

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:33.401
The deal, Captain Tate?
The deal...

01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:36.529
is that you clowns have totally
fucked up my investigation,

01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:39.157
that I was conducting
for the last five years. Five years.

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.576
Five years of my life I spent
getting that item,

01:24:41.701 --> 01:24:45.080
slowly reeling in
the two factions responsible for it.

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:47.749
Look, man...
I saw you die.

01:24:47.874 --> 01:24:50.001
- You really can't get over that, can you?
- No, no, no, I can't.

01:24:50.126 --> 01:24:53.254
Let me put it this way.
Lampone, you know, uh, Kobe?

01:24:53.379 --> 01:24:55.090
- He is in on it too.
- That's right,

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:57.592
and the Russians and Italians
both have a hit out on him now.

01:24:57.717 --> 01:24:59.552
He's had to go into deep hiding.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.721
It's deep, man.

01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:02.931
Penetrating deep.

01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:05.100
Chief, are we in on this?

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:06.476
Yeah, so anyway,
this is what I need.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.812
I need you guys to keep a teeny weeny
little secret for me.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.064
All the shooting, the fires,
the wreckage at the base,

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:12.732
it's kinda set the public off a little.

01:25:12.857 --> 01:25:14.234
So you guys are gonna
have to take the fall for it.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.236
I mean, uh,
the glory for all of it.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.446
Just keep your mouths shut.

01:25:18.571 --> 01:25:20.698
You think you can handle that
this time?

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:23.451
You guys are gonna
look like heroes,

01:25:23.576 --> 01:25:25.161
little kids are gonna
write you little letters.

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:26.579
You'll end up on Good Morning, LA.

01:25:26.704 --> 01:25:27.789
All of that,
blah, blah, blah,

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:29.791
and everything will end up just fine.

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.709
Just shut up, OK?

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:35.380
And one more thing -
uh, you never saw me here.

01:25:41.594 --> 01:25:42.971
So how she feel?

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.306
Just like new, maybe better.

01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.517
I think she's better.

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.602
Ball called again.

01:25:49.727 --> 01:25:52.355
Yeah? You tell him
you still had your job?

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.609
Yeah, but I also told him
to keep my seat warm.

01:25:56.734 --> 01:26:00.655
Eagle 4, we have a 187
in progress at 2540 Cahuenga.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.782
This is Eagle 4,
we're on our way.

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:05.618
OK if Daisy comes with?

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:09.122
Wouldn't have it any other way.
