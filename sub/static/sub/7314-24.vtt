WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.670
(grunting)

00:04.672 --> 00:06.705
(screams)

00:06.707 --> 00:08.407
Vance:
<i>How long do we have to wait</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:10.576
For the inquiry
into ilan bodnar's death?

00:10.578 --> 00:11.777
Richard parsons.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.312
I'm the independent counsel.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.613
Adam eshel.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.782
Did you sleep with him?
Go to hell!

00:16.784 --> 00:18.250
Interview's over!

00:18.252 --> 00:19.318
You told him to go to hell.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.286
I went to israel
to bury my father.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.755
It was a moment
of weakness.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.323
Mcgee:
Boss, we had it wrong.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.191
Parsons isn't after
ziva or vance.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.726
Special agent
leroy jethro gibbs,

00:27.728 --> 00:29.495
You've manipulated
evidence

00:29.497 --> 00:34.500
Do you take full responsibility
for the actions of your team?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.135
What do you think?

00:42.509 --> 00:44.576
(birds chirping)

00:49.049 --> 00:51.150
Franks:
Nothing out here
worth catching.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.221
Too much sun.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.791
You know, the clouds
bring the tricky ones

00:58.793 --> 00:59.691
To the surface.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.727
They're smart that way.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.729
Sure you're talking
about fish?

01:03.731 --> 01:08.567
Talking about all sorts
of bottom-feeders.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.335
Yeah, well...

01:10.337 --> 01:11.670
Never been much

01:11.672 --> 01:14.540
For catch and release.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.375
You and me both.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.178
But there's some folks
don't understand that.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.448
Some of the big ones
would rather

01:22.450 --> 01:25.484
Die fighting than get caught.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.485
Ooh...

01:26.487 --> 01:27.486
(grunts)

01:27.488 --> 01:28.787
There's something.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.657
There's a lot of fight
left in this one.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.859
Give me a hand,
will you?

01:37.730 --> 01:39.665
Geez. Think you got
'em there, mike?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.300
(laughs)

01:45.805 --> 01:47.473
Mike?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.141
Mike?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.873
Something on your mind, gibbs?

02:22.242 --> 02:23.242
Fishing.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.243
(clears throat)

02:24.245 --> 02:25.911
Sounds like fun.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.915
I'm more of
a woodworking guy, myself.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.884
Like to build things
with my hands.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.921
I knew that would get
your attention.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.925
(sighs)

02:42.862 --> 02:44.696
It's been almost a week.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.832
Coming in here,
keeping your mouth shut.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.401
It's nice to hear you
finally say something.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.236
I got one question:

02:51.238 --> 02:54.473
All of this...

02:54.475 --> 02:55.841
Why now?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.778
Because enough is enough.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.247
You've been pushing
legal boundaries

03:02.249 --> 03:05.717
And sweeping things
under rugs for 20 years.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.520
My division of the dod
is like internal affairs.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.589
You think we didn't notice?

03:11.691 --> 03:15.227
Your actions
have been inappropriate.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.197
And your actions
are my responsibility now.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.800
The deaths of eli david
and jackie vance,

03:21.802 --> 03:23.569
They opened doors
to an investigation

03:23.571 --> 03:24.937
And I'm happy that it did.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.272
You're happy, huh?

03:29.542 --> 03:33.278
I believe in upholding
the law, gibbs.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.348
And I am tired
of watching you break it.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.919
No reason to make this harder
than it has to be.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.754
Step up.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.590
Take responsibility.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.593
I'll leave
your people alone.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.929
All I want is the truth.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.935
You weren't there.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.836
Yes, sir. Yes.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.038
Any news, you'll be
the first to know.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.708
Secnav hitting dead ends?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.543
He just spoke to the ig.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.646
They're giving parsons
carte blanche.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.382
Little creep.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.917
He's like the bastard grandson
of j. Edgar hoover.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.820
Must have files on everybody.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.889
Does he have
something on you?

04:52.625 --> 04:55.027
I won't dignify that
with an answer.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.695
People are afraid of him, tom.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.863
I'd like to know why.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.432
The most dangerous person
in washington

05:00.434 --> 05:02.734
Is the one who knows
who you really are.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.971
Well, I'm a widower
who needed closure.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.540
You were playing
with fire, leon.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.376
God knows I told you and your
team to stay away from bodnar.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.812
Well, my wife
was telling me different.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.382
Look, tom,
if this is a witch hunt,

05:17.384 --> 05:19.051
If parsons' goal
is to hurt this agency,

05:19.053 --> 05:21.953
Then why am I not the one
that's taking the hit?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.089
You said it yourself:

05:24.091 --> 05:25.524
You're a victim.

05:26.894 --> 05:30.362
The political fallout
of going after a man

05:30.364 --> 05:31.563
Who's lost everything

05:31.565 --> 05:33.732
Because of his agent's
poor judgment.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.767
So he's gunning
for the next best thing.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.903
To an investigator
like parsons,

05:37.905 --> 05:40.105
Gibbs is a hell of a trophy.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.074
Gibbs:
You know, you talk a good game,

05:42.076 --> 05:44.443
Parsons,
but you got nothing.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.345
How far back do
you want to go?

05:46.347 --> 05:49.915
Director shepard,
or all the way to... Nis?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.116
What do you call that?

05:51.118 --> 05:53.118
I call that desperation.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.453
Yours or mine?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.455
You know what?
Don't answer that.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.023
Wait until
your lawyer's present.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.091
I don't have one.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.492
Sure you do.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.095
They just texted me
that he's on his way up.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.965
Man:
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.000
Gibbs, you can stop talking now.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.402
I never started.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.437
Agent chegwidden.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.040
As in the
judge advocate general?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.442
Ah, that was a long time ago.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.412
Uniform barely fits
these days.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.947
I'm, uh, private sector now.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.615
You have any tea?
I'd like some tea.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.717
You'll be defending
special agent gibbs?

06:25.719 --> 06:26.952
Well, if he'll have me.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.420
Our paths crossed
back in the day.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.021
Got a little
catching up to do.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.157
I didn't call you, admiral.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.792
No, director vance did.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.528
Pulling out the
big guns, I see.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.597
Well, let the
games begin.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.735
A man's career is in balance,
and you think it's a game.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.036
(scoffs)

06:45.038 --> 06:46.071
For what it's worth,

06:46.073 --> 06:47.606
I don't like losing, never have.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.176
Where's my cup of tea, son?

06:54.781 --> 06:57.082
Nice to see you again, gunny.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.595
Guys, in case
you're interested,

07:10.597 --> 07:12.898
Agent mcgee files all his naked
anime pictures under "n."

07:13.900 --> 07:15.434
Who are they?

07:15.436 --> 07:17.169
Tony:
Dcis.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.203
Records are being subpoenaed.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.438
What could these old files

07:19.440 --> 07:21.072
Possibly have to do
with anything?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.841
That was gibbs.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.177
He's ordering us to
lay low and back off.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.612
Well, I think
he's making a mistake.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.648
Doesn't mean we have to listen.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.453
Start digging,
mcdirty laundry.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.788
Get a look at parsons'
personal life.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.590
Career. Friends.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.725
Enemies. Frenemies.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.128
Everybody's got
something to hide.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.631
I hate unnecessary gang violence
as much as the next girl,

07:46.633 --> 07:48.133
But sometimes...

07:48.135 --> 07:49.601
There's no alternative.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.970
(laughing, music playing)

07:51.972 --> 07:54.840
Eat my lead, richard.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.809
Well done,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.211
Miss sciuto.
That is some

07:59.213 --> 08:02.180
Extraordinarily
impressive gunplay.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.181
Regular abby oakley.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.483
Do you want to
take a shot?

08:04.485 --> 08:05.851
It's totally gratifying.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.154
Uh, well, I think we'll pass,
under the circumstances.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.223
You are certainly
in better spirits

08:11.225 --> 08:12.224
Than I expected.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.592
Oh, no.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.694
I am in horrible spirits.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.662
Just creating a game

08:17.664 --> 08:21.132
Where I can take out
this dancing, vile loser

08:21.134 --> 08:23.535
Is my way of channeling
my parsonian venom.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.737
He's trying
to take down my gibbs.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.038
He's a little piece of

08:27.040 --> 08:28.640
Filthy, disgusting...

08:28.642 --> 08:30.575
Ducky:
Many years ago,

08:30.577 --> 08:32.010
I completed my

08:32.012 --> 08:34.713
U.S. Medical examiner training
in an office

08:34.715 --> 08:36.982
In foggy bottom,
in a dreadful lab

08:36.984 --> 08:42.254
In a complex more commonly
referred to as watergate.

08:42.256 --> 08:45.090
Yes, the proverbial walls
have ears, abby.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.758
We'd all be better served

08:46.760 --> 08:49.628
If you keep
your animosity visual.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.531
Do you think the dod
is listening?

08:52.533 --> 08:53.865
(increases music volume)

08:53.867 --> 08:56.601
Remember when tony
bugged parsons?

08:56.603 --> 09:00.705
We appear to be pawns
in a game of tit-for-tat.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.073
I just discovered this device

09:02.075 --> 09:03.642
Clinging to the underside

09:03.644 --> 09:05.544
Of one of my desk drawers.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.746
So we must proceed
with caution.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.081
The word is mum.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.149
(imitates zipper)

09:11.151 --> 09:12.751
Yeah, mum.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.889
Parsons: Judge maddox,
I spent the past week

09:17.891 --> 09:20.625
Trying to get special agent
gibbs to cooperate.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.161
He was unwilling, so I
scheduled a pre-arraignment.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.130
And now I've rescheduled it.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.332
The defendant just got himself
an attorney.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.001
He deserves a chance
to solidify his position.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.003
One day, your honor.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.271
By law, he gets one day

09:33.273 --> 09:34.739
After charges
have been filed

09:34.741 --> 09:35.674
To collect
his thoughts.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.275
But you still haven't filed

09:37.277 --> 09:38.944
One single formal charge.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.011
Because I gave him

09:40.013 --> 09:42.113
Ample opportunities

09:42.115 --> 09:44.983
To admit that he and his
coworkers had broken the law.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.651
Chegwidden:
You want a confession.

09:46.653 --> 09:47.986
I want the truth.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.688
The truth is, this man
has dedicated his life

09:49.690 --> 09:51.756
To putting his life
on the line.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.126
You zig when you should
have zagged, agent gibbs?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.795
No, ma'am.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.198
Maybe you're barking up
the wrong tree, richard.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.801
I've got to pick up
my grandson's birthday cake.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.669
A.J., I don't know
if your client thinks

10:04.671 --> 10:07.072
That he can beat
the house or not,

10:07.074 --> 10:10.175
But I should remind you
that I'm a pretty good

10:10.177 --> 10:12.177
Poker player myself.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.713
Based on what
I've read so far,

10:14.715 --> 10:16.715
We're gonna sit down
in 48 hours

10:16.717 --> 10:18.650
And probably arrest
special agent gibbs.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.685
That's how long
you have

10:20.687 --> 10:21.853
To put your
hand together.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.723
I suggest you make it
a damn good one.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.092
48 hours, your honor.
We'll be there.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.128
And, uh, happy birthday
to your grandson.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.799
(scoffs)

10:38.805 --> 10:43.642
We are in here because
dr. Mallard found a wiretap.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.744
Question is, is
it ig-sanctioned?

10:45.746 --> 10:48.713
You guys,
I just found this one

10:48.715 --> 10:50.715
In the towel dispenser
in the ladies' room.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.186
'cause-'cause the men's room
was-was being cleaned.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.988
I don't normally go
in the ladies' room.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.357
Um, it smells nicer.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.092
How do we know there's not
a bug in the elevator?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.327
Don't worry about it, tim.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.728
I've been up top,

11:03.730 --> 11:05.363
Hannibal lecter style;
she's clean.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.699
Well then, um, allow
me to speak freely.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.668
I wish it didn't take
a crisis

11:09.670 --> 11:13.038
For us to have this time,
like, all close together.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.272
And so I'm gonna vote

11:14.274 --> 11:15.974
For biweekly elevator meetings.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.677
All right, matter
at hand, ms. Sciuto.

11:18.679 --> 11:22.147
I can assure you that everything
parsons is doing is legitimate,

11:22.149 --> 11:24.816
But our main course of action
now is to stop the bleeding.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.452
Does anybody know
anything else that could

11:27.454 --> 11:28.987
Increase the threat
to agent gibbs

11:28.989 --> 11:30.188
During this investigation?

11:33.059 --> 11:35.126
Files, photographs,
documents?

11:37.797 --> 11:39.030
Yes.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.767
What about all the
stuff at gibbs' house?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.179
You sure there was
nothing here worth taking?

11:57.116 --> 11:58.883
Still works.

11:58.885 --> 11:59.951
(footsteps approaching)

11:59.953 --> 12:02.187
(door creaks open)

12:09.762 --> 12:12.363
Gibbs, you okay?

12:13.933 --> 12:15.467
Tony:
Wow, boss.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.168
This place has been pulverized.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.770
You think?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.805
Who is he?

12:20.807 --> 12:22.240
Vance sent me a lawyer.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.242
What about rule 13?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.910
Never heard of it.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.345
Wait a second. I know you.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.748
I used to hang
around the navy yard some.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.949
Oh, it'll come to me.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.083
We need to find you

12:32.085 --> 12:33.785
A safe place
to stay-- a hotel,

12:33.787 --> 12:35.854
Someplace we can talk openly.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.860
Oh, I-I know a place.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.867
You built this, boss?
Yeah.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.001
Well, most of it.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.303
You little
doomsday prepper.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.378
Tony:
Ooh. Very abe lincoln.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.846
Ziva:
Or very gibbs.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.349
Has that road always been here?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.817
There was no road.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.018
Not until I cleared it.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.788
No plumbing, no electricity,
no address.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.856
Well, I think it's lovely,

13:11.858 --> 13:13.858
In a rustic, sort
of unfinished way.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.193
Full of splinters.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.796
Well, the cell phones have
been off since we left,

13:17.798 --> 13:18.930
And gps, too.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.064
Nothing traceable.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.300
I'm not hiding, dinozzo.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.835
Nothing to hide from.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.370
Then why play
jeremiah johnson?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.905
'cause we have things
to talk about,

13:26.907 --> 13:29.140
And the less parsons
is privy to, the better.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.379
That's possum scat.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.413
Hmm?

13:35.415 --> 13:36.948
Are you enjoying nature, tony?

13:36.950 --> 13:40.985
I just don't like nature
when it's all over my shoes.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.854
Well, the possums
were here first.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.956
(helicopter hovering overhead)

13:46.292 --> 13:48.493
Okay, everybody
inside. Let's go.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.395
Thermals will show
the cars are still hot.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.030
Helo could be unrelated.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.999
I'm not taking the chance.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.836
I am not a fugitive.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.538
Not yet.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.050
(tony groans)

14:12.052 --> 14:13.885
I don't know
about this menu, boss.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.988
I'm not sure ziva's ready
for the full-on mel brooks

14:16.990 --> 14:18.356
<i>Blazing saddles</i> experience.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.225
Ziva:
I don't know how you
can think of eating

14:20.227 --> 14:23.261
Chegwidden:
All right, this is what
I have on parsons.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.231
After his dad bought him
an ivy league law degree,

14:26.233 --> 14:27.932
He clerked for a
couple of big wigs

14:27.934 --> 14:29.400
At the justice department.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.369
Then he spent a few years
at a philadelphia law firm

14:31.371 --> 14:33.872
Before relocating to dc.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.039
Where he worked his way

14:35.041 --> 14:37.342
Up the independent
counsel ladder of dod.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.410
Well, more like he
weaseled his way up.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.012
Word on the street
is he, uh,

14:41.014 --> 14:43.014
Kissed the appropriate rings.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.382
And now he's out
to make his mark

14:44.384 --> 14:49.020
Yeah, look, this is not all
just smoke and mirrors here.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.022
He genuinely believes

14:51.024 --> 14:53.258
There's legal boundaries
that can't be crossed.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.392
But we have done nothing wrong.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.094
Well, that's your word
against his.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.029
He's convinced he's doing
the right thing.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.163
(scoffs)

14:59.165 --> 15:01.332
Our actions were justified.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.301
Save it for the jury.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.402
(footsteps outside)

15:04.404 --> 15:05.403
Ziva:
Quiet.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.372
(knocking)

15:15.447 --> 15:17.548
Wow, this place is hard to find.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.350
Good.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.219
Come on, mcgee,
join the party.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.488
Pull up a stump.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.556
Uh, I can't, boss.
We're late.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.225
We got a dead navy seal
in virginia.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.393
I'm not going.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.194
Not now.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.664
Tell that
to the victim's family.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.533
Ziva, go on.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.468
Go. Do the work.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.717
(indistinct chatter,
dogs barking)

15:52.719 --> 15:54.619
(siren whooping)

15:54.621 --> 15:56.621
Hey, tim, where's
the victim?

15:56.623 --> 16:01.526
Overnight delivery left him
on the front porch.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.095
Little guy?
Not exactly.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.332
Wife's a flight attendant--

16:07.334 --> 16:08.566
Emily mcbride.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.501
She just got back
from a three-day trip

16:10.503 --> 16:12.603
And found this waiting
for her on her front step.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.173
Label says it was shipped
from riyadh, saudi arabia.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.708
Can you help me
with the trunk?

16:16.710 --> 16:18.176
Uh-huh.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.318
Kevin spacey.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.753
You know him?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.589
No. Kevin spacey--
he did the same thing

16:31.591 --> 16:34.525
To gwyneth paltrow
at the end of the movie <i>seven.</i>

16:34.527 --> 16:37.195
Meet navy seal
lieutenant chad mcbride.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.164
I better call ducky.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.468
Woman:
<i>I'd learned over the years...</i>

16:43.470 --> 16:47.538
Not to worry when chad
had a mission.

16:49.108 --> 16:52.643
Or at least to try not to.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.179
Where was
your husband going?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.115
Emily:
He couldn't say.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.751
I'm not sure even he knew.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.453
So you hadn't spoken recently.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.490
No. Not since he left.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.626
(crying):
Almost two weeks ago.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.463
(sobs) chad was...
A terrific husband,

17:12.465 --> 17:16.134
A dedicated officer.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.636
I can't imagine...

17:18.638 --> 17:21.239
What he went through.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.343
Why would
someone do this?

17:27.446 --> 17:28.546
Ducky and palmer?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.448
I already gave them a heads-up.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.619
Oh, god.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.522
Well, on the plus side,
it makes for a much shorter

17:37.524 --> 17:39.724
Protocol list
than a whole body.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.594
Which is, I'm sure, a tremendous
comfort to the lieutenant.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.697
Oh, I'm... Sorry.
I-I meant no disrespect.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.567
Allow me to forgive you
on his behalf, mr. Palmer.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.137
You were merely trying
to make lemonade with lemons.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.639
The protocol
may be shorter,

17:54.641 --> 17:58.609
But the human head still
offers an abundance of clues.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.078
Eyelash,

18:00.080 --> 18:01.813
Ear and nasal hairs.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.782
They do a remarkable job
of collecting data.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.484
And that, I suspect,

18:06.486 --> 18:08.619
Will give us a great
deal of information

18:08.621 --> 18:10.421
On the lieutenant's
whereabouts

18:10.423 --> 18:12.190
At the time
of his death.

18:12.192 --> 18:16.094
Yes, well, it is certainly a...
Unique and different autopsy.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.595
Well, variety is

18:17.597 --> 18:19.130
The spice of life,
mr. Palmer.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.698
Shaking things up
keeps us alert

18:20.700 --> 18:22.700
And on our toes.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.669
You know, speaking
of shaking things up,

18:24.671 --> 18:27.572
Uh, breena and I, we're...

18:27.574 --> 18:29.674
Having a baby.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.511
(chuckling):
My dear jimmy.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.246
Well-well, such...

18:35.248 --> 18:38.616
Such news shouldn't
be delivered as an aside.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.785
How long have you known?
When is the baby due?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.854
Oh, wait, oh, wait,
no, no, no, no, it's, uh...

18:42.856 --> 18:44.655
Breena's not <i>due</i> due.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.224
We're on a waiting list.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.126
We decided to adopt.
We figure

18:48.128 --> 18:50.294
There are so many
unwanted kids out there

18:50.296 --> 18:51.762
That we'd-we'd adopt first.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.731
Bravo, mr. Palmer!

18:53.733 --> 18:55.566
Such a decision

18:55.568 --> 18:59.403
Is admirable and
positively thrilling.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.671
Jimmy:
Whoa.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.840
This guy's pinned at 11.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.711
Break out our
protective gear,

19:06.713 --> 19:08.513
Mr. Palmer, and
suit up immediately.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.881
I really should've
done this earlier.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.682
Now, hurry!

19:14.753 --> 19:17.355
Forgive me for being
so blunt, lieutenant...

19:17.357 --> 19:18.623
(panting)

19:18.625 --> 19:21.692
...But where the hell
have you been?

19:27.766 --> 19:30.168
You hear that?
I hear what?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.603
Behind those trees.

19:32.605 --> 19:36.240
Are you gonna tell me
what we're looking for?

19:36.242 --> 19:39.777
I'm looking for a woman
with curves like a country road,

19:39.779 --> 19:41.579
And lips soft
as velvet.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.381
Oh, that's nice to know, mike.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.716
We're looking
for a strip club.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.186
See? You think too much.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.188
Your whole career,

19:50.190 --> 19:52.657
You acted on instinct.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.725
Listen to your gut.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.795
Don't stop now.
Shoot first,

19:57.797 --> 20:00.498
Ask questions later.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.733
Yeah, and if I make a mistake?

20:02.735 --> 20:06.871
Over the years,
we do some things,

20:06.873 --> 20:10.241
Some good, some bad.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.411
Decisions that help one person

20:13.413 --> 20:15.479
And hurt another.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.219
Damned if you do...

20:21.221 --> 20:25.690
In the end, we make sacrifices,
live with them.

20:26.658 --> 20:29.227
Things happen
sometimes

20:29.229 --> 20:31.762
That are out of our control.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.398
(footsteps nearby)

20:41.440 --> 20:42.840
(gunshot)

20:53.885 --> 20:55.853
She's dead.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.390
My wife is dead, gibbs.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.862
(door opens)
chegwidden:
Morning.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.599
Got your coffee from
that diner you go to.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.570
Ready to talk whenever you are.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.315
Oh.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.716
(grunts)

21:29.621 --> 21:31.689
Morning.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.964
We're both just
doing our jobs.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.034
The interesting
thing here is,

21:43.036 --> 21:46.404
Your job is to catch
bad guys, and so is mine.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.006
It's even harder
to catch the ones

21:49.008 --> 21:52.410
I'm after, though,
because they're like you.

21:52.412 --> 21:56.947
They're good people,
but they've made bad decisions.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.919
I sympathize with you
losing your father.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.588
I can't imagine
what that must have been like.

22:06.892 --> 22:10.961
I know that agent gibbs
is very important to you also.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.999
But wouldn't it
be terrible

22:15.001 --> 22:17.601
To watch both men fall?

22:19.471 --> 22:22.940
I know you threw bodnar
off that ship,

22:22.942 --> 22:27.478
And I know that you killed
your own brother ari.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.914
And yet there has been
no punishment for either.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.915
Like gibbs,

22:30.917 --> 22:34.585
You just forget
and you move on.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.021
Until now.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.090
(bell dings, doors open)

22:41.560 --> 22:43.961
(sighs)

22:43.963 --> 22:45.763
It's only a matter of time.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.098
(bell dings, doors close)

22:55.474 --> 22:57.007
Please.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.743
Yes, director.

23:02.681 --> 23:05.015
(door opens and closes)

23:05.017 --> 23:06.617
Appreciate you reaching out,
captain wayne.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.085
I'm sure your hands
are full.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.987
What can I do for you, director?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.857
A jsoc operative of yours,

23:12.859 --> 23:15.459
Lieutenant chad mcbride,
showed up here last night.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.061
At least part
of him did.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.630
How much have you ascertained
about the lieutenant's mission?

23:19.632 --> 23:22.633
By his wife
that he was a navy seal.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.535
We got a sense
of when he shipped out,

23:24.537 --> 23:26.003
But other than that,
we're in the dark.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.571
Look, all I can tell you

23:27.573 --> 23:29.807
Is that he was doing
some top secret recon.

23:29.809 --> 23:34.745
Forgive me, captain,
but withholding information

23:34.747 --> 23:37.882
Doesn't fly when a dead
navy seal shows up in my morgue

23:37.884 --> 23:39.116
Hotter than chernobyl.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.152
Pardon?

23:41.154 --> 23:43.154
You heard me.
We have a radiation issue.

23:43.156 --> 23:47.425
Keep the remains secure
while I speak to my superiors.

23:47.427 --> 23:51.028
I'll take care of the deceased
as long as I get some answers.

23:51.030 --> 23:54.198
No one-- I repeat, no one--
hears about this.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.800
Am I making myself clear?

23:55.802 --> 23:58.569
Need I remind you
that we're on the same team?

23:58.571 --> 24:01.005
Word travels fast, director.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.773
Be careful.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.776
Your team is already under
significant scrutiny.

24:16.955 --> 24:19.890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.959
Abby, what's wrong?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.761
I don't like this one bit.

24:23.763 --> 24:24.929
Talk to us, ms. Sciuto.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.065
Is coughing up results
like-like hairballs.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.100
Like-like the big sticky kind
that stick in

24:30.102 --> 24:31.936
A kitty's throat
for hours and then...

24:31.938 --> 24:33.103
Abby!

24:34.639 --> 24:37.675
So I fed everything
that ducky and jimmy gave me

24:37.677 --> 24:41.078
From lieutenant mcbride's
remains into major mass spec.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.080
We know that he was
shipped from saudi arabia

24:43.082 --> 24:45.683
And his nasal passages
were lined with sand

24:45.685 --> 24:47.985
And other desert-related
microorganisms.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.553
You couple that
with physical signs

24:49.555 --> 24:51.121
Of extreme dehydration and...

24:51.123 --> 24:55.092
He was held somewhere in the
middle east, probably tortured.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.027
Right, but you can skip
the "probably" part.

24:57.029 --> 25:00.097
Lacerations to his head and neck
indicate that he was beaten

25:00.099 --> 25:03.033
With a piece of wood
or a stick of some sort.

25:03.035 --> 25:06.003
The shards of wood are lodged
inside the cuts.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.105
I'm still working on its origin.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.573
So whatever the lieutenant's
mission was,

25:09.575 --> 25:11.008
The people who killed him

25:11.010 --> 25:12.076
Were overnighting
us a message.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.011
Abby:
Where I come from,

25:14.013 --> 25:16.213
A radiated and
tortured head in a box

25:16.215 --> 25:17.982
Usually means
"back off."

25:17.984 --> 25:20.017
Backing off is the last thing

25:20.019 --> 25:23.721
Woman: Yes, sir.
Get me tom morrow now.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.891
Mcgee:
I have some new intel
on parsons.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.026
This guy really is
a natural politician.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.861
Every professional move
carefully planned

25:30.863 --> 25:33.163
And orchestrated right down
to the people he praised

25:33.165 --> 25:34.999
In his law school
dissertations.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.567
Professional brownnoser.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.569
That is another
way to put it.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.170
But it's made him
some powerful friends.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.139
Guy's knee-deep
in secure files,

25:42.141 --> 25:44.675
Like some kind of hoarder
of classified information.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.911
It's a smart hobby
in this town.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.979
He's even gotten his hands
on some sensitive

25:48.981 --> 25:51.015
Personal documents
belonging to high-level types

25:51.017 --> 25:52.616
In the justice department.

25:52.618 --> 25:54.285
Blackmail?

25:54.287 --> 25:56.287
Question: How did you get
all this information?

25:56.289 --> 25:59.623
How did you get past
parsons' firewall?

25:59.625 --> 26:01.025
That's kind of personal.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.193
Personal? Since when?

26:04.095 --> 26:06.230
Oh, I've seen
this expression before.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.631
Mcsnoop dogg!

26:07.633 --> 26:09.099
Are you getting
jiggy with some

26:09.101 --> 26:10.901
Highly classified
dod beauty?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.137
You are.
Am I right?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.638
Her name is delilah.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.173
Delilah...

26:16.175 --> 26:18.576
My, my, my,
delilah.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.812
She specializes in web
and information security.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.781
Of course she does.
Beautiful delilah.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.049
Okay, that's enough.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.952
We have to go
tell gibbs.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.853
So proud of you.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.756
Please don't do that ever again.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.662
Where'd you learn
to work like this?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.965
Uh, I always worked.
Didn't have a choice.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.068
You know I'm gonna
need more, right?

26:44.070 --> 26:45.703
Yeah? More what?

26:45.705 --> 26:47.304
Explanation.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.872
You don't follow rules.

26:48.874 --> 26:49.974
I got my own.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.875
You take matters
in your own hands.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.211
You understand there's
a domino effect here?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.080
You take the
lead agent down,

26:56.082 --> 26:58.082
The rest of
the team falls.

26:59.050 --> 27:00.651
My fault.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.219
It's not that simple.

27:04.255 --> 27:05.889
It should be.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.124
Well, it's not.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.226
According to
ig records, your team

27:09.228 --> 27:12.129
They're... They're sending them
to the morgue.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.731
Yeah, sometimes.

27:13.733 --> 27:17.267
Ari haswari,
agent michelle lee,

27:17.269 --> 27:18.836
Paloma reynosa,
harper dearing...

27:18.838 --> 27:20.671
There was no other choice.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.172
There's always a choice.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.674
The question is:

27:23.676 --> 27:26.210
Were their deaths
absolutely necessary?

27:27.312 --> 27:29.146
Nothing I wouldn't do again.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.649
Please tell me you're not
gonna say that in court.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.717
(laughs)

27:33.719 --> 27:36.053
I won't be in court.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.428
(door opens)

27:47.198 --> 27:50.668
All those people
in all those cities.

27:50.670 --> 27:54.204
And somehow our troubles
still find a way to matter.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.240
Mr. Parsons...

27:56.242 --> 27:59.376
Kindly come out
from behind my desk.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.047
We're a lot alike.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.281
Are we?

28:04.283 --> 28:05.883
We both believe
in the law

28:05.885 --> 28:07.284
And what it's
capable of.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.453
Your take on me,
on the other hand,

28:09.455 --> 28:11.021
Is completely false.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.257
Oh, I doubt that.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.696
You know, I don't think
we should be having

28:18.698 --> 28:20.864
This conversation
without a witness.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.168
You don't want a witness.
Not for this.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.937
Talk.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.406
In preparations
for the indictment proceedings,

28:29.408 --> 28:33.343
I have been combing through
a vast array of documents.

28:33.345 --> 28:38.382
And a certain file
has gone missing.

28:38.384 --> 28:42.886
Okay, I'll bite. Which one?

28:42.888 --> 28:44.221
A little over two years ago,

28:44.223 --> 28:45.989
Ms. Sciuto was hired
by the mexican government

28:45.991 --> 28:49.093
To investigate
a drug-related shooting.

28:49.095 --> 28:53.263
The file, detailing her results,
is nowhere to be found.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.466
You wouldn't happen
to know where this file

28:55.468 --> 28:57.935
Would be, do you?

28:59.304 --> 29:02.239
I have no idea what file
you're talking about.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.342
My advice to you:

29:05.344 --> 29:08.245
Stay above the muck.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.519
Well, sometimes you have to ruin
a good pair of shoes

29:15.521 --> 29:17.121
To do what's right.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.224
Let me ask you
something, parsons.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.926
You doing what's right?

29:27.398 --> 29:29.333
Tony:
<i>We think we have enough, boss.</i>

29:29.335 --> 29:31.435
Enough what?

29:31.437 --> 29:34.304
Boss, these are parsons'
last five cases.

29:34.306 --> 29:38.909
Ziva:
Each of them resulting in
a sizeable promotion for him.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.512
Tony:
We know you told us
not to dig, boss, but...

29:41.514 --> 29:44.314
We were wondering:
Why is mcgee's

29:44.316 --> 29:47.084
Evil doppelganger getting
all the good stuff in town?

29:47.086 --> 29:48.886
Because he's collecting
damaging information

29:48.888 --> 29:51.221
About his more established
dod colleagues

29:51.223 --> 29:53.223
And using it against them.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.927
Found dozens of sordid e-mails
in an alias account.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.262
Guy's a first-class blackmailer.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.097
Which means we have enough.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.899
Enough what?

30:01.901 --> 30:04.334
Enough for vance to present
to the inspector general.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.403
Enough to weaken parsons.

30:07.372 --> 30:08.806
No.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.274
No?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.142
No. I told you
to stay out of it.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.077
We play by parsons' rules,
it means we're admitting

30:14.079 --> 30:15.112
We did something wrong.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.014
Well, we wanted to help.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.582
And now we have a paper trail.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.185
Gibbs, you cannot do this alone.
You have to let us help you.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.487
Hey, it is not your job!

30:23.489 --> 30:25.289
It is not about my job!

30:25.291 --> 30:27.457
This about my family!

30:37.001 --> 30:38.202
(sighs)

30:38.204 --> 30:39.403
Nice tantrum, ziva.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.938
Oh, shut up!

30:40.940 --> 30:42.873
Not now.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.308
(sighs)

30:44.310 --> 30:45.943
Gibbs is just doing
what he thinks is right.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.477
I know what he's doing.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.213
I know he's trying
to protect me.

30:49.215 --> 30:53.851
For my own actions,
for my <i>own</i> mistakes.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.119
And this is
no different.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.560
(sighs)

31:10.335 --> 31:13.403
Look...

31:13.405 --> 31:18.475
I'm sorry if I hurt you
in all of this.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.878
It was never intended.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.880
Tony...

31:22.882 --> 31:26.383
I care too much about our...

31:26.385 --> 31:29.086
Friendship.

31:31.356 --> 31:34.157
I do not want it to
be awkward between us.

31:34.159 --> 31:37.027
Hey...

31:41.499 --> 31:45.369
Nothing's awkward
between friends.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.641
Sorry I'm late.

31:50.643 --> 31:53.377
On the phone
with jsoc.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.679
Did wayne tell you
about the mcbride case?

31:55.681 --> 31:58.081
Wish we could have
intercepted that package

31:58.083 --> 32:00.117
Before the wife
ever opened it.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.020
Ncis would never
have been called in.

32:03.022 --> 32:06.556
What are you not
telling me, tom?

32:06.558 --> 32:09.526
You can't be held responsible
for what you don't know.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.663
I'll find out
one way or another.

32:13.631 --> 32:15.632
There's a connection...

32:15.634 --> 32:18.201
Between the death
of that navy seal

32:18.203 --> 32:20.203
And what's happening
with your team.

32:20.205 --> 32:23.006
What kind of connection?

32:23.008 --> 32:26.176
The murder of eli david
opened a political can of worms

32:26.178 --> 32:29.346
That was much bigger
than anyone expected.

32:29.348 --> 32:33.550
Eli and arash kazmi
wanted to forge a peace.

32:33.552 --> 32:37.254
But bodnar killing them
opened the door.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.690
Homeland and the cia
wait for chances

32:39.692 --> 32:42.559
Like this to stir the pot.

32:42.561 --> 32:47.564
So that all sorts
of recon can happen.

32:47.566 --> 32:51.435
The cia needed iran to believe
mossad was responsible.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.470
Are you telling me...

32:53.472 --> 32:56.139
That bodnar didn't kill kazmi?

32:56.141 --> 32:58.742
I'm telling you
we did it, leon.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.411
The cia took out
kazmi that night

33:01.413 --> 33:04.681
So that bodnar would end
up being the fall guy.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.484
Iran and israel
could duke it out

33:07.486 --> 33:09.753
While we focused
on the real threat.

33:09.755 --> 33:14.057
We're all so damn worried
about iran and north korea,

33:14.059 --> 33:18.095
When the real threat
is here on home soil.

33:27.038 --> 33:30.007
It's a shell game,
isn't it?

33:30.009 --> 33:32.042
Keep people distracted.

33:32.044 --> 33:36.646
Leon, you see why I wanted
you to keep your distance?

33:36.648 --> 33:39.216
The attorney, parsons,
did he know anything

33:39.218 --> 33:40.650
About this when he started
this investigation?

33:40.652 --> 33:44.621
But he saw an opportunity
just like we did.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.491
What about the navy seal,
chad mcbride?

33:48.259 --> 33:50.494
It's not good, leon.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.772
(door creaking)

34:01.774 --> 34:04.041
(dog barking in distance)

34:25.596 --> 34:28.198
Franks: I love what you've
done with this place.

34:30.468 --> 34:32.602
You gonna pour me
some of that?

34:35.106 --> 34:37.407
Nope.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.608
There's nothing left.

34:40.778 --> 34:44.114
Could've at least
saved me the worm.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.817
You know, I figured
you'd come home...

34:46.819 --> 34:48.852
After you made
up your mind.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.620
No sense in hiding

34:50.622 --> 34:52.689
When all you're running
from is the truth.

34:54.325 --> 34:56.493
Nobody's running.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.462
I'm not so sure.

34:58.464 --> 35:02.265
Keeping yourself all
walled up at that cabin.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.338
It's a good place to think.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.406
Maybe it's time

35:09.408 --> 35:13.376
To stop thinking
and start doing.

35:13.378 --> 35:16.480
Unless you're afraid
of something.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.716
You keep losing people.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.319
Shannon, kelly,
yours truly.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.387
Who's next?

35:25.756 --> 35:28.525
You know what
you should do.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.861
Come clean.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.396
Admit that there
are good reasons

35:33.398 --> 35:36.399
You did the
things you did.

35:40.404 --> 35:43.206
All I ever wanted to be
was a good marine.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.612
A good husband.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.481
And you have.

35:54.352 --> 35:57.554
This joker, parsons,
wants to fight.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.423
What are you gonna do?

36:12.336 --> 36:14.738
Fight.

36:14.740 --> 36:18.508
Jethro cannot be expected
to handle this on his own.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.377
You're preaching
to the symphony, ducky.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.378
Choir.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.712
Mcgee:
Leave her alone, tony.

36:22.714 --> 36:23.914
It's okay, mcgee.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.182
I can handle him myself.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.883
Yes, she can.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.452
Abby: Since when did
it become illegal

36:29.454 --> 36:32.355
To catch bad people
and do good things?

36:32.357 --> 36:34.491
I hate parsons.
I-I just want

36:34.493 --> 36:37.794
To kick him in his...
Delicate place.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.797
Let her go, mckilljoy.
It was just getting good.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.399
I'm turning
into some sort

36:42.401 --> 36:44.801
Of sadistic scientific
rabble rouser.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.336
Rabble what?

36:46.338 --> 36:48.638
Ooh.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.575
Boss, what are you doing here?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.777
I work here.

36:58.749 --> 37:01.251
Damn right, he does.

37:04.689 --> 37:07.357
Gibbs, I never saw this coming.

37:07.359 --> 37:10.827
Well, it's a little late now,
director.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.297
They tell me bodnar had nothing
to do with kazmi's death.

37:14.299 --> 37:16.266
Cia.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.770
Seems some folks have
bigger fish to fry.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.873
Ncis was just collateral damage.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.442
Yeah, we'll bounce back.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.543
Skin's pretty thick.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.379
Parsons isn't giving up.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.548
He intends to make
an example out of you.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.549
Let him.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.351
What you see is what you get.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.886
Success, failure...

37:36.888 --> 37:38.555
All of it.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.258
You want to fight?

37:42.560 --> 37:44.394
Not by his rules.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.498
Tom morrow may have a solve.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.601
We pull it off,
this could all go away.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.670
For all of us?

37:53.672 --> 37:55.639
Clean slate.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.841
What's the catch?

37:59.377 --> 38:00.877
It might kill you.

38:02.713 --> 38:04.381
So could bad clams.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.383
(laughs)

38:08.486 --> 38:11.688
We sure picked one hell
of a career, didn't we, gibbs?

38:13.057 --> 38:16.426
Got to make a living, leon.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.468
Franks:
<i>We collect secrets</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

38:25.470 --> 38:28.538
<i>Hide behind them,</i>
<i>depend on them,</i>

38:28.540 --> 38:30.707
<i>Like aces up our sleeve.</i>

38:32.576 --> 38:34.678
<i>We think we have</i>
<i>to protect the people</i>

38:34.680 --> 38:36.846
<i>We love from the truth,</i>

38:36.848 --> 38:38.848
But the truth isn't the poison.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.850
<i>It's the cure.</i>

38:40.852 --> 38:42.919
(whirring)

38:46.957 --> 38:49.526
<i>Best thing you can do</i>
<i>is teach your kids</i>

38:49.528 --> 38:51.528
<i>Not to be afraid.</i>

38:51.530 --> 38:52.929
We don't have
to do this.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.864
I think we do.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.100
Gibbs would do the same for us.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.502
Ziva:
Mcgee's right.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.738
You may not like
how this ends, ziva.

39:02.807 --> 39:05.642
I have never depended
on happy endings.

39:17.088 --> 39:20.390
You three have something to say?

39:36.073 --> 39:39.075
Franks:
<i>We try to live a good life.</i>

39:39.077 --> 39:41.544
<i>A clean life.</i>

39:43.514 --> 39:46.649
<i>But secrets get in the way.</i>

39:53.758 --> 39:56.726
<i>Sure, we can play dirty,</i>

39:56.728 --> 40:00.830
<i>Use people's mistakes</i>
<i>against them.</i>

40:02.600 --> 40:05.635
<i>But put all those secrets</i>
<i>behind us,</i>

40:05.637 --> 40:08.838
<i>And the honest man</i>
<i>comes out on top.</i>

40:20.651 --> 40:22.719
(door opens)

40:25.656 --> 40:26.923
What is this?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.458
Where is he?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.160
Good to see you,
too, richard.

40:30.162 --> 40:32.429
Where is agent gibbs?

40:32.431 --> 40:33.663
He's gone.

40:33.665 --> 40:36.132
A special mission for jsoc,
top priority.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.034
That's not part of the deal.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.803
He can't just not show up.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.171
The hell he can't.

40:41.173 --> 40:44.641
I gave your client
ample opportunity

40:44.643 --> 40:46.709
To take responsibility
for his actions,

40:46.711 --> 40:48.678
And now I see
that giving him

40:48.680 --> 40:50.680
A chance to step up
was a waste of time.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.482
Sit down, parsons,
and shut up.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.617
I always liked that guy.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.621
Morrow:
Your inspector general

40:58.623 --> 41:01.658
Just postponed the investigation
effective immediately.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.926
(sighs)

41:02.928 --> 41:04.761
This is crazy, all right?

41:04.763 --> 41:06.996
I have got thousands
of documents

41:06.998 --> 41:08.965
Ready to indict
leroy jethro gibbs.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.967
Parsons, you should know

41:10.969 --> 41:13.002
That gibbs's team handed in
their resignations.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.038
They took
full responsibility

41:15.040 --> 41:16.940
For the accusations.

41:16.942 --> 41:19.509
And you're going
to let them cover for him?

41:19.511 --> 41:21.010
Once gibbs was cleared,

41:21.012 --> 41:22.912
We requested
his immediate assistance.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.216
Is agent gibbs so valuable

41:26.218 --> 41:28.985
That you would allow this
to happen?

41:37.828 --> 41:39.896
(loud, raspy breathing)

41:43.834 --> 41:47.203
(wheezing)

41:47.205 --> 41:49.539
(loud wheezing)

41:49.541 --> 41:51.708
(loud, raspy breathing)

41:51.710 --> 41:55.245
Gibbs... Do it.

41:55.247 --> 41:57.514
(loud, airy breathing)

41:59.683 --> 42:02.652
Do it.
