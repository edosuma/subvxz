In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.056 --> 00:06.133
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.168 --> 00:07.998
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.032 --> 00:09.829
These are their stories.

00:12.390 --> 00:15.487
As an expert in cochlear implant surgery,

00:15.522 --> 00:19.396
should that surgery have been
performed on this baby?

00:19.431 --> 00:20.611
No.

00:21.112 --> 00:23.807
The baby's hearing would have
never been restored,

00:23.842 --> 00:29.286
and the operation led directly to
the post-surgical complication of meningitis,

00:29.321 --> 00:31.062
which killed the patient.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.908
- Objection, your honor!
- You son of a bitch!

00:32.943 --> 00:34.684
I recommended you
for your fellowship, sir!

00:34.719 --> 00:37.953
This child was predisposed
for its meningitis. / Order! Order!

We the deaf do not want to hear
the noise of their world.

01:01.066 --> 01:06.434
In our deaf world,
we find our peace and our power.

01:06.469 --> 01:10.064
If you cannot understand this,
then go.

01:19.297 --> 01:23.643
Deaf power! Deaf power! Deaf power!

02:55.626 --> 02:58.515
Hello?
I am deaf.

02:58.751 --> 03:00.358
I cannot hear you.

03:00.393 --> 03:01.965
There's been a murder.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.471

Dr. Jack Mallory, ear surgeon.

03:57.553 --> 04:00.380
A deaf patient called it in.
She's in the exam room.

04:00.415 --> 04:01.405
Your partner signs?

04:01.440 --> 04:04.440
Well, not enough for a witness interview.
We called for an interpreter.

04:04.475 --> 04:06.720
Well, the doctor's
girlfriend's on the way.

04:06.755 --> 04:09.473
- She's a Manhattan ADA.
- Yeah.

04:10.202 --> 04:11.233
Hey.

04:11.884 --> 04:14.276
For the st. Patrick's day parade,

04:14.311 --> 04:17.689
the co-ops board up all their windows.

04:20.091 --> 04:22.017
It's a smart time to kill somebody.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.401
Yeah, except, judging by the rigor,
this guy was killed last night.

04:25.436 --> 04:27.240
Friday night in his office.

04:27.275 --> 04:29.331
He has no appointments
in his book.

04:29.366 --> 04:30.908
No sign of a break-in.

04:30.943 --> 04:33.490
He must have buzzed his killer in.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.405
A robbery?

04:38.066 --> 04:40.244
Uh, it looks like...

04:41.605 --> 04:44.889
yeah. The cabinet was broken into.

04:44.924 --> 04:47.251
I got painkillers.

04:47.286 --> 04:50.479
Well, I can't find
any prescription pads.

04:50.514 --> 04:52.796
Somebody cleaned him out.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.069
That spatter...

04:56.417 --> 04:58.298
what's that gunk?

04:58.606 --> 05:02.393
Oh, it looks like, uh...

05:05.453 --> 05:10.570
yeah, it's potato.
It's an Irish silencer.

05:10.605 --> 05:13.352
Urban lore.
It's not very effective.

05:13.387 --> 05:15.706
A silencer, boarded-up windows.

05:15.741 --> 05:17.990
It was a pretty quiet murder.

05:18.025 --> 05:22.289
Except the killer shot
the surgeon in the hand.

05:22.324 --> 05:26.554
And let him live long enough
so it would swell up.

05:26.852 --> 05:28.702
Maybe the doctor resisted?

05:28.737 --> 05:31.659
Maybe he tortured him to find out
where the drugs were?

05:31.694 --> 05:33.326
That makes sense.

05:34.478 --> 05:36.761
This bruise on his neck.

05:36.796 --> 05:39.045
His, uh, larynx was crushed.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.702
His voice box.

05:40.737 --> 05:42.117
Once that was done,

05:42.152 --> 05:44.686
Mallory wouldn't have
been able to say a word.

05:44.721 --> 05:46.101
Detective Eames?

05:46.136 --> 05:47.061
Yeah.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.051
Detective Peter Lyons,
community affairs.

05:52.758 --> 05:54.766
You need an interpreter?

05:55.767 --> 05:57.791
What time did you get here, Malia?

05:57.826 --> 05:59.258
I got here at 9 A.M.

05:59.293 --> 06:04.401
The door was open,
and Dr. Mallory was on the floor.

06:04.436 --> 06:08.102
Jack doesn't see patients on Saturdays.
What were you doing here?

06:08.941 --> 06:10.602
Uh...

06:10.863 --> 06:13.070
Counselor, you're
the doctor's girlfriend?

06:13.105 --> 06:14.539
Fiancee.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.824
Claudia Shankly,
Manhattan DA's office.

06:17.859 --> 06:21.075
Okay, can, uh,
I speak to you outside?

06:22.072 --> 06:24.678
The drug cabinet was broken into?
This must've been a robbery.

06:24.713 --> 06:26.938
There's no sign of forced entry.

06:26.973 --> 06:30.669
Do you know what your fiance
was doing here last night?

06:30.929 --> 06:34.871
We both work late on Fridays,
then we have the weekends to ourselves.

06:34.906 --> 06:37.680
That deaf woman, did you
check her for gunshot residue?

06:37.715 --> 06:40.212
And how many people are you letting
trample through the crime scene?

06:40.247 --> 06:42.758
Just step back in here, please.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.309
Yes, Mr. Branch, we've alerted
area pharmacies.

06:46.344 --> 06:50.534
They're keeping an eye out
for Mallory's prescription pads.

06:50.569 --> 06:51.595
I understand.

06:51.630 --> 06:53.467
We're doing everything we can, sir.

06:53.502 --> 06:54.460
Thank you.

06:54.495 --> 06:56.134
Obviously, on this case,

06:56.169 --> 06:59.673
we're gonna be getting a lot of
assistance from the DA's office.

06:59.708 --> 07:02.770
Did Mr. Branch confirm his DA's alibi?

07:02.805 --> 07:07.780
She was downtown catching cases
till 2 A.M.

07:07.815 --> 07:10.777
This, uh, Dr. Mallory.
What did he do?

07:10.812 --> 07:12.452
Cochlear implants.

07:12.487 --> 07:14.058
That's a bionic ear?

07:14.093 --> 07:16.598
According to Peter,
the NYPD interpreter,

07:16.633 --> 07:19.068
it's very complicated inner-ear surgery.

07:19.103 --> 07:22.738
They implant electrodes
to stimulate auditory nerves,

07:22.773 --> 07:24.314
then intensive therapy.

07:24.349 --> 07:25.820
It's no magic bullet.

07:25.855 --> 07:29.788
So most of his patients are deaf?

07:29.823 --> 07:32.698
The DA wanted to be sure
you took a look at the patient list.

07:32.733 --> 07:33.668
We did.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.987
And it ranges from pro bono infants

07:36.022 --> 07:40.155
to fat cats going deaf
from too much oxycodone.

07:40.190 --> 07:41.358
No one has a record.

07:41.393 --> 07:43.024
His financials look clean?

07:43.059 --> 07:45.194
As far as we can tell,
he's a well-respected,

07:45.229 --> 07:47.451
upstanding member of the community.

07:47.486 --> 07:51.216
Who I'm betting kept a lot of
painkillers in his office.

07:51.251 --> 07:54.947
One of Mallory's scrips turned up
at a Wall street pharmacy.

08:00.607 --> 08:02.989
Stealing prescription pads.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.232
Jared, you're a Wall street guy.

08:05.267 --> 08:09.012
Can't you afford a Dr. Feelgood
when you need to feel good?

08:09.047 --> 08:11.868
It's not stolen.
I got it from Dr. Mallory.

08:11.903 --> 08:15.136
Two points for memory.
And why did you see Dr. Mallory?

08:15.171 --> 08:18.422
Back pain.
I injured it playing squash.

08:20.695 --> 08:23.550
Wasn't Dr. Mallory
an ear doctor, Eames?

08:23.585 --> 08:26.575
Stop.
I'll pay the fine, okay?

08:28.700 --> 08:30.302
A fine. No, this isn't about a fine.

08:30.337 --> 08:32.400
Dr. Mallory was murdered.

08:38.696 --> 08:40.361
You can't think I did that.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.256
We can't?
Where were you Friday night?

08:43.291 --> 08:45.711
Before st. Patrick's day?

08:45.746 --> 08:47.954
I was, uh, I was out drinking
with my investment team.

08:47.989 --> 08:52.163
- We started early.
- When did you get the scrip?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.049
Uh, this morning.

08:54.084 --> 08:57.678
From Antonio, mayor of
the coffee shop on 24th and 3rd.

09:09.129 --> 09:10.766
Are you Antonio?

09:10.991 --> 09:12.251
Who are you?

09:12.286 --> 09:14.215
I'm Jared's friend.

09:15.065 --> 09:17.502
Look, I ran out of Vicodin.
I need to get a couple pills.

09:17.537 --> 09:20.305
My doctor's out of town.

09:20.340 --> 09:23.073
My, my back is killing me.

09:24.136 --> 09:27.095
Can I get one or two
till the morning from you?

09:27.130 --> 09:28.964
You want to borrow them?

09:28.999 --> 09:30.764
You knew better than that.

09:30.799 --> 09:33.530
You might own your own for 50 bucks.

09:34.059 --> 09:35.894
How's 40?

09:40.469 --> 09:41.819
I'll take that, Antonio.

09:41.854 --> 09:44.435
You're under arrest.
Stand up.

09:45.809 --> 09:49.166
You're gonna have to help me.
My chair's over there.

09:51.530 --> 09:53.966
I swear, I found them
on the sidewalk.

09:54.001 --> 09:56.368
Look at my record.
I'm a career junkie.

09:56.403 --> 09:59.723
I can come up with
a better story than that.

09:59.758 --> 10:02.022
You see these pills?

10:02.057 --> 10:05.184
They belong to the doctor
that was murdered.

10:05.477 --> 10:08.459
Now, Antonio,
we're gonna ask you again.

10:09.223 --> 10:11.690
How did you get his prescription pads?

10:11.725 --> 10:13.775
I'm telling you, I found them.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.825
I did, outside a doctor's office.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.809
Fifth avenue, uptown?

10:17.844 --> 10:19.759
That's not my route.

10:19.794 --> 10:21.131
Route?

10:21.166 --> 10:23.308
Yeah, I do more than push pills.

10:23.343 --> 10:26.649
I got a side line.
I surf lab boxes.

10:26.684 --> 10:29.065
The pickup boxes
outside doctors' offices?

10:29.100 --> 10:30.142
Yeah, those.

10:30.177 --> 10:31.879
I take the samples
and sell them to people

10:31.914 --> 10:34.035
who need clean urine and blood.

10:34.070 --> 10:36.254
- What neighborhood?
- Murray hill.

10:36.289 --> 10:39.908
I found the drugs and the scrips
outside a doctor's office.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.725
You remember the doctor's name?

10:41.760 --> 10:42.780
No.

10:42.815 --> 10:48.051
32nd street, double glass doors,
next to some ice cream place.

10:50.161 --> 10:51.535
You have a junkie in custody

10:51.570 --> 10:53.675
who was in possession of
one of Jack's prescription pads,

10:53.710 --> 10:55.108
and he hasn't been charged?

10:55.143 --> 10:56.560
He's in a wheelchair.

10:56.595 --> 10:59.939
He wouldn't have been able to navigate
the stairs up to Dr. Mallory's office.

10:59.974 --> 11:02.792
Then someone gave them to him.
He knows who the killer is.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.772
He doesn't.
He's a junkie.

11:04.807 --> 11:06.872
He would've sold somebody out
if he could have.

11:06.907 --> 11:08.943
Look, we're gonna
check out his story now.

11:08.978 --> 11:09.976
What about Jack's patients?

11:10.011 --> 11:11.449
One of them must have
had a drug problem.

11:11.484 --> 11:14.407
He had no other appointments Friday
other than lunch with you.

11:14.442 --> 11:16.316
Did he say where
he was going afterwards?

11:16.351 --> 11:20.081
Um, he was testifying
in some malpractice case.

11:20.427 --> 11:22.557
Against another doctor?

11:22.592 --> 11:23.934
Yeah.

11:25.302 --> 11:26.980
Do you have his name?

11:33.723 --> 11:35.025
I told them to clear the sidewalk.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.321
Their ringleader says
they want to be arrested.

11:37.356 --> 11:39.583
- I called their dean.
- Double glass doors.

11:39.618 --> 11:42.947
And an ice cream place next door.

11:43.392 --> 11:45.731
I didn't know Major case
covered unlawful assembly.

11:45.766 --> 11:47.383
We didn't know this was going on.

11:47.418 --> 11:50.410
The doctor they're protesting, Dr. Strauss,

11:50.445 --> 11:53.403
Mallory testified
against him last Friday.

11:55.217 --> 11:56.686
Eames?

11:57.210 --> 12:00.187
This box is too high
for Antonio to reach.

12:00.222 --> 12:01.930
Look what we got here.

12:01.965 --> 12:03.638
Another prescription pad.

12:05.965 --> 12:10.213
Dr. Jack Mallory in Dr. Strauss' box.

12:19.829 --> 12:23.698
Dean Price, your students
are paranoid, aggressive.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.753
I'm a target.
My family lives upstairs.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.773
Why haven't you arrested these people?

12:27.808 --> 12:29.170
These people?

12:29.205 --> 12:33.100
The deaf are a community
whose voice is not heard, Dr. Strauss.

12:33.135 --> 12:34.855
Now that they've expressed themselves,

12:34.890 --> 12:39.001
they will leave if you agree
not to press charges.

12:40.319 --> 12:42.634
Just make sure they don't come back.

12:42.669 --> 12:44.546
Thank you, dean Price.

12:44.581 --> 12:46.232
We'll take over.

12:53.010 --> 12:54.662
This is harassment.

12:54.697 --> 12:57.174
They're interfering
in my place of business.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.468
They're intimidating
my family, my patients.

12:59.503 --> 13:01.727
This isn't the first time
you've been picketed?

13:01.762 --> 13:02.846
No.

13:03.279 --> 13:05.408
I've had hang-ups.
They follow me home.

13:05.443 --> 13:07.165
- Any vandalism?
- Yeah.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.609
A couple of the sample boxes out front
have been broken into.

13:10.644 --> 13:14.100
Oh, you think the protesters
are responsible.

13:14.135 --> 13:17.563
Who else? It's part of their plan
to harass ear surgeons.

13:17.598 --> 13:19.149
'cause you perform implants?

13:19.184 --> 13:20.072
Exactly.

13:20.107 --> 13:23.111
They believe we're responsible
for a cultural holocaust

13:23.146 --> 13:25.035
just because we restore hearing.

13:25.070 --> 13:30.084
It's not because of that malpractice suit
that you're involved in?

13:30.740 --> 13:33.521
I can't comment on ongoing litigation.

13:33.556 --> 13:37.465
Didn't Dr. Mallory testify
against you in that case?

13:38.456 --> 13:41.788
Jack and I have had
our professional disagreements.

13:41.823 --> 13:44.949
He's not above catering
to the deaf community.

13:44.984 --> 13:46.315
But now with Mallory gone,

13:46.350 --> 13:50.222
your lawyer can claim that
you lost the right to cross-examine.

13:50.257 --> 13:51.712
His murder is a tragedy.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.648
The only people who profit from it
are these lunatics.

13:54.683 --> 13:56.683
Like the one who
broke into your lab box?

13:56.718 --> 13:59.268
- You know who did it?
- Yes, and he's not deaf.

13:59.303 --> 14:01.783
He told us when he raided
your sample boxes,

14:01.818 --> 14:05.996
he found drugs and
Dr. Mallory's prescription pads.

14:06.031 --> 14:07.746
That's ridiculous.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.749
Well, we found one too.

14:10.715 --> 14:14.301
Come on, detective, why would I
put them outside my own front door?

14:14.336 --> 14:15.370
You tell us.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.511
And tell us where you were
Friday night.

14:19.501 --> 14:24.999
I was at a medical conference
in Atlantic city all weekend.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.609
These students,
they really hate this guy.

14:30.644 --> 14:33.191
Strauss says they hate
all cochlear implant doctors,

14:33.226 --> 14:35.092
including Mallory.

14:35.127 --> 14:36.923
He's overstating it.

14:36.958 --> 14:40.420
Look, the implant was
a lightning rod in the '90s.

14:40.455 --> 14:43.883
It implied that a deaf person
needed to be fixed.

14:43.918 --> 14:46.508
But with email, video conferencing,

14:46.543 --> 14:49.901
the community has more access
into the hearing world.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.053
The implant just becomes another option.

14:53.088 --> 14:56.939
Couldn't Dr. Mallory have been killed
by a deaf activist?

14:56.974 --> 14:58.791
Wasn't there evidence that

14:58.826 --> 15:03.068
the killer was overly worried
about being heard?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.602
He might have been.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.806
Or someone like Strauss could've been trying
to throw suspicion on the deaf community.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.396
Just what we were wondering.

15:10.431 --> 15:13.711
Which is why we're about
to check Strauss' alibi.

15:14.610 --> 15:17.457
Strauss was the conference
keynote speaker on Saturday morning,

15:17.492 --> 15:18.439
and he missed his speech?

15:18.474 --> 15:20.420
He also missed the meet and
greet Friday night.

15:20.455 --> 15:22.313
According to the conference planner,

15:22.348 --> 15:26.465
he spent Saturday holed up in his room,
partying with the minibar.

15:26.500 --> 15:30.104
He might have been embarrassed
about his malpractice suit.

15:30.139 --> 15:33.708
Or he may have needed to self-medicate
after killing Mallory.

15:33.743 --> 15:35.916
Well, this won't help his cause.

15:35.951 --> 15:38.055
Strauss: permit for GLOCK 9MM

15:38.090 --> 15:39.969
The same make that killed Mallory.

15:40.004 --> 15:41.247
Bring him in.

15:43.097 --> 15:45.716
Uh, Friday night after court adjourned,

15:45.751 --> 15:48.920
my lawyer and I had a strategy dinner.

15:48.955 --> 15:52.089
I left for Atlantic city around 9, right?

15:53.912 --> 15:58.829
Counselor, you were with Dr. Strauss
until he left for Atlantic city?

15:58.864 --> 15:59.862
Careful what you say,

15:59.897 --> 16:02.485
'cause we know when he checked in.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.424
My client is not a killer,

16:07.459 --> 16:10.368
but he does suffer
from painkiller addiction.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.962
Which has only gotten worse
because of the stress of the trial.

16:12.997 --> 16:14.550
He is going into rehab.

16:14.585 --> 16:16.069
So is everyone else.

16:16.104 --> 16:19.028
Did you see him off to AC?

16:19.235 --> 16:22.018
Not exactly.
We finished dinner around 8,

16:22.053 --> 16:23.030
and then I went home.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.660
8 P.M.?

16:24.695 --> 16:29.159
That's strange.
Your hotel said you checked in at 3 A.M.

16:29.194 --> 16:32.332
You want to explain that gap?

16:33.717 --> 16:35.616
I can't, really.
I, uh...

16:35.651 --> 16:38.164
I had a few drinks,
took some pills,

16:38.199 --> 16:41.213
and I woke up in Atlantic city.

16:41.248 --> 16:42.896
You drove drunk?

16:42.931 --> 16:44.509
Don't answer that.

16:44.544 --> 16:47.288
- We're done here.
- I used a car service.

16:47.323 --> 16:49.127
You can check my credit card.

16:49.162 --> 16:50.568
We can do that.

16:50.603 --> 16:53.402
One more thing. You own
a 9-millimeter Glock, don't you?

16:53.437 --> 16:57.207
Yes, detective,
and I have a permit for it.

16:57.242 --> 17:00.238
All right, we're gonna need
to check the gun too.

17:03.078 --> 17:04.171
That was his car service.

17:04.205 --> 17:07.233
They say Strauss didn't
get picked up till 1 A.M.

17:07.269 --> 17:10.474
Which would have given him
more than enough time to kill Mallory.

17:10.510 --> 17:12.906
1 A.M.? Where was he?

17:12.941 --> 17:15.268
1444 Amsterdam avenue.

17:15.303 --> 17:17.372
What the hell was he doing up there?

17:18.905 --> 17:22.696
"Morningside heights
rifle and pistol range. "

17:23.656 --> 17:25.616
He only hit his target twice.

17:25.651 --> 17:27.646
Dr. Strauss was having an off night?

17:27.681 --> 17:29.607
He's not a marksman to begin with.

17:29.642 --> 17:32.399
Add booze, and he completely
loses his edge.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.839
You let a drunk man shoot a gun?

17:34.874 --> 17:37.543
As soon as we realized,
I took it away.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.431
Had to wait
till he stopped to reload,

17:40.466 --> 17:43.390
confiscated his weapon,
vouchered it.

17:43.425 --> 17:46.315
- Under a lock and key?
- Absolutely.

17:50.014 --> 17:51.107
Anyone else touch it?

17:51.142 --> 17:53.320
No one's touched it till you.

17:55.912 --> 17:58.633
And so Strauss, how did he react?

17:58.668 --> 18:00.186
Uh, belligerent?

18:00.221 --> 18:01.669
Arrogant at first.

18:01.704 --> 18:04.579
Said he'd sue us,
then he cried.

18:04.614 --> 18:07.353
We babysat him
till his car service came.

18:07.388 --> 18:10.206
Took forever, around 1.

18:10.241 --> 18:12.785
- You sure about the time?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.286
It was after closing.

18:14.321 --> 18:16.936
Instead of tipping me,
he cursed me.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.518
Thanks.

18:19.278 --> 18:22.380
If this gun was under lock and key
Friday night,

18:22.415 --> 18:25.483
then the gun that killed Mallory
is still out there.

19:17.617 --> 19:19.948
Three shots.
I found a slug in the couch.

19:19.983 --> 19:22.279
9- millimeter, pristine.
How's the dean?

19:22.314 --> 19:24.233
Stable.
The bullet grazed her neck.

19:24.268 --> 19:25.933
Another inch, it would have
hit her carotid.

19:25.968 --> 19:27.147
She didn't see her shooter.

19:27.182 --> 19:29.816
This is an attempted
political assassination.

19:29.851 --> 19:31.384
He's trying to kill my wife.

19:31.419 --> 19:33.234
This is professor Price,
the dean's husband.

19:33.269 --> 19:36.589
- You think you know who did this?
- I do know, Larry Forseca.

19:36.624 --> 19:38.580
He's the deaf playwright in residence.

19:38.615 --> 19:41.881
Ever since he's arrived,
he's waged a campaign against my wife,

19:41.916 --> 19:43.941
trying to eject her from the tribe.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.267
But your wife's deaf.

19:45.302 --> 19:49.285
Not deaf enough for Larry
and the radical deaf community.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.028
Because she's married to you,
a hearing man?

19:52.063 --> 19:53.264
Larry's a separatist.

19:53.299 --> 19:56.429
Unlike my wife,
who believes in inclusion.

19:56.464 --> 19:59.045
Larry's been actively trying
to force her out as dean

19:59.080 --> 20:01.754
so he can take over the department.

20:01.789 --> 20:05.728
Academic infighting is one thing,
but attempted murder...

20:05.763 --> 20:09.667
That's my wife's office.
That's Larry's theater building.

20:09.702 --> 20:12.006
Connect the dots.

20:19.777 --> 20:22.307
Easy access to the theater.

20:24.358 --> 20:26.799
Perfect eyeline to the dean's window.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.584
And another potato silencer.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.559
I guess the shooter doesn't know
they don't work.

20:32.594 --> 20:35.660
Lots of cigarettes.
Menthols.

20:35.695 --> 20:39.512
Larry's a playwright. He wouldn't be
the first writer who smokes.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.001
- Any luck?
- Nah.

20:42.036 --> 20:44.314
All I could get out of them
is Larry left an hour ago.

20:44.349 --> 20:46.937
No one here is gonna
give us any more than that.

20:46.972 --> 20:49.526
They know what the dean's
husband thinks of Larry,

20:49.561 --> 20:51.523
so they're closing ranks.

20:52.896 --> 20:54.653
Is that Malia?

20:57.775 --> 21:02.650
She's a patient of Mallory's,
and an actress in Larry's play?

21:02.685 --> 21:05.495
From what I understand,
she's the star.

21:07.202 --> 21:08.980
I don't know where Larry is.

21:09.015 --> 21:13.199
Malia, you're the only person
who's been at the scene of both shootings.

21:13.234 --> 21:16.246
Do yourself a favor,
don't lie to us.

21:17.224 --> 21:20.100
Last time I saw Larry,
he left to do rewrites.

21:20.135 --> 21:21.950
We fought.

21:21.985 --> 21:23.657
About his play?

21:23.692 --> 21:26.335
He took something from
a private conversation.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.956
I was angry.

21:27.991 --> 21:31.396
He had a scene where my character
was considering an implant.

21:31.431 --> 21:33.478
Were you?

21:35.919 --> 21:38.145
That's why you were seeing Dr. Mallory.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.392
Larry knew about the implant.

21:40.427 --> 21:42.586
You two fought in front of everyone?

21:42.621 --> 21:46.005
No, Larry thought I was
making him look bad.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.234
So we took it to the theater lounge.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.182
This is the last place I saw him.

22:01.041 --> 22:03.790
I never should have told Larry
about the implant.

22:03.825 --> 22:06.540
Do you know who these
cigarettes might belong to?

22:07.276 --> 22:10.227
Larry, he smokes like crazy.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.765
Sorry, I've got to go to rehearsal.

22:17.940 --> 22:22.102
Same cigarettes that are on the roof.
Menthols.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.755
A staircase.

22:27.583 --> 22:31.997
From here to the roof,
a straight shot.

22:34.121 --> 22:36.759
So Larry the deaf playwright finds out

22:36.794 --> 22:40.419
that the beautiful star of his play
is going for a cochlear implant,

22:40.454 --> 22:43.254
so he shoots her surgeon,

22:43.289 --> 22:46.461
once in the hand and once in the chest.

22:46.754 --> 22:48.554
What's that got to do
with the dean Price shooting?

22:48.589 --> 22:52.632
Same make of gun in both shootings,
same potato silencer.

22:52.667 --> 22:53.676
Any motive?

22:53.711 --> 22:56.318
We have hate emails
from Larry to Sondra Price,

22:56.353 --> 22:58.826
and her husband says
he's threatened her.

22:58.861 --> 23:01.265
Anything concrete
to link Larry to the crime?

23:01.300 --> 23:04.493
We have cigarette butts we found
on the rooftop that match Larry's brand.

23:04.528 --> 23:06.905
We're waiting for DNA.

23:06.940 --> 23:10.881
And you haven't been able
to track Larry down.

23:10.916 --> 23:12.962
What do we know about this guy?

23:12.997 --> 23:17.871
Well, he feels that deaf culture
is under assault.

23:18.788 --> 23:22.646
The villain in his last play is
an administrator, modeled on dean Price.

23:22.681 --> 23:25.478
He resents the notion
the deaf need to assimilate.

23:25.513 --> 23:27.397
Okay, a lot of playwrights are angry.

23:27.432 --> 23:29.282
That doesn't make Larry a killer.

23:29.317 --> 23:31.102
Well, he's a guru.

23:31.137 --> 23:34.382
Maybe if he thinks we're gonna
give him a platform, he'll talk.

23:34.417 --> 23:37.627
Peter said there's a deaf social
tonight at a skating rink.

23:37.662 --> 23:39.815
He thinks Larry might show.

23:45.626 --> 23:48.076
The entire deaf studies
department is here...

23:48.111 --> 23:50.172
except Larry.

23:50.406 --> 23:51.698
No one's seen him tonight.

23:51.733 --> 23:52.996
That kid.

23:53.031 --> 23:55.926
He was picketing Strauss' office.

23:55.961 --> 23:57.935
He an actor too?

23:57.970 --> 24:01.395
No, he's Malia's boyfriend.
Tommy Kellerman.

24:02.888 --> 24:04.644
What did he just say to you?

24:04.679 --> 24:06.678
He called me a traitor.

24:07.773 --> 24:11.225
The deaf are gonna rally
around their own at a time like this.

24:11.260 --> 24:14.342
For people trying to bridge
both worlds, like me,

24:14.377 --> 24:16.779
they use it as a litmus test.

24:16.814 --> 24:18.760
And I'm failing.

24:18.795 --> 24:20.672
They're fighting.

24:20.707 --> 24:24.461
You gotta help me out.
I can't make out what they're saying.

24:25.679 --> 24:28.017
I'm not comfortable eavesdropping.

24:28.052 --> 24:29.450
They know that we're here.

24:29.485 --> 24:32.441
They have no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

24:32.476 --> 24:34.347
- Please.
- It's a private event.

24:34.382 --> 24:36.218
In a public place.
Please, Eames!

24:36.253 --> 24:38.093
Don't put me in the middle.

24:39.302 --> 24:42.055
Now their gestures again, bigger.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.461
It's like they're shouting.

24:45.496 --> 24:48.454
You've got to tell me
what they're saying.

24:50.415 --> 24:53.694
Look, I know that
he's talking about Larry.

24:55.110 --> 24:56.824
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

24:56.859 --> 24:59.581
He's telling her to be careful
of what she tells the police. / Okay.

24:59.616 --> 25:01.670
- And that we'll try to frame Larry.
- All right.

25:01.705 --> 25:06.388
She's saying that there's no way
that Larry shot Dr. Mallory or dean Price.

25:06.423 --> 25:09.654
That he's an activist, not a murderer.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.159
Now they...

25:12.383 --> 25:13.701
they know that we're
talking about them,

25:13.736 --> 25:15.742
so they're hiding their hands.

25:15.777 --> 25:17.704
They can read lips
and body language, detective.

25:17.739 --> 25:19.137
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

25:19.172 --> 25:20.766
It's a public place.

25:20.801 --> 25:23.911
We have no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

25:23.946 --> 25:24.936
Ballistics are in.

25:24.971 --> 25:27.056
It was the same gun in both shootings.

25:27.091 --> 25:29.107
The DNA on the cigarettes from the roof

25:29.142 --> 25:33.009
is a positive match to the cigarettes
in the theater lounge.

25:33.044 --> 25:36.359
All right, look,
I'm gonna call the DA,

25:36.867 --> 25:39.830
Make sure they know
we want to arrest Larry.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.374
They made up quickly.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.570
Well, they kind of have to
in their world.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.173
You know, it's not
just about the signing.

25:55.208 --> 25:58.821
It's about the cocoon.

25:59.287 --> 26:03.124
You want to be all wrapped up
and safe inside.

26:03.567 --> 26:05.861
Not shut out.

26:10.547 --> 26:13.033
My parents are both deaf.

26:13.441 --> 26:16.974
They used to call home
our own little Eden.

26:28.875 --> 26:30.156
Detective.

26:30.191 --> 26:31.754
Larry agreed to turn himself in.

26:31.789 --> 26:33.283
Claims he was on a writing binge.

26:33.318 --> 26:36.597
Told Peter he didn't know
we were looking for him.

26:38.801 --> 26:42.628
Larry, there's a lot of people
pointing their finger at you.

26:44.589 --> 26:46.620
He's asking if I'm deaf.

26:46.655 --> 26:48.074
All right.

26:48.304 --> 26:51.107
No, my parents are deaf.

26:55.891 --> 26:58.910
- That's not good enough.
- Meaning?

26:59.463 --> 27:01.340
Get me a deaf cop.

27:01.375 --> 27:03.411
A deaf cop?

27:04.717 --> 27:07.004
Get me a jury of my peers.

27:07.039 --> 27:09.065
Get me a deaf judge.

27:10.594 --> 27:13.421
Then I'll participate in your system.

27:13.456 --> 27:16.248
Until then,
there's no justice for me.

27:16.996 --> 27:18.915
Yeah, uh...

27:20.844 --> 27:22.832
Can you give us a minute?

27:25.545 --> 27:28.345
He wants a deaf cop.
There are no deaf cops.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.767
Beautiful.

27:29.802 --> 27:33.799
If you found my DNA at a crime scene,
I guess I'd try that too.

27:33.834 --> 27:35.229
Well, he's not trying
to get out of this.

27:35.264 --> 27:37.453
He's trying to prolong it.

27:37.488 --> 27:40.788
He's found the way
to become a martyr for his cause.

27:40.823 --> 27:42.789
Detective, you can't be
falling for this.

27:42.824 --> 27:44.342
He's clearly a violent man.

27:44.377 --> 27:46.261
He's dramatic.
That doesn't mean he's guilty.

27:46.296 --> 27:48.775
Captain, he leaves his cigarette butts
everywhere in that theater.

27:48.810 --> 27:50.191
Anyone could have planted them.

27:50.226 --> 27:52.655
Just 'cause he's deaf
doesn't mean he's not a murderer.

27:52.690 --> 27:54.316
I understand your loss, counselor,

27:54.351 --> 27:56.548
but this is still
a circumstantial case.

27:56.583 --> 27:58.429
What are they saying now?

27:58.464 --> 28:00.241
I'm purposely turning away.

28:00.276 --> 28:03.186
- You're what?
- He's talking to his lawyer.

28:03.221 --> 28:04.756
In plain view.

28:04.791 --> 28:06.333
And could be confessing to murder.

28:06.368 --> 28:09.337
He know that we can see him.
He's posturing for us.

28:09.372 --> 28:11.810
It's illegal for me
to tell you that.

28:11.845 --> 28:14.483
Captain, we are allowed
to read body language.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.519
Captain, talk to your detective.

28:16.554 --> 28:23.121
My detectives know that Major case is not in
the habit of violating attorney/client privilege.

28:23.156 --> 28:25.531
You're really not going to help?

28:25.566 --> 28:27.405
Absolutely not.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.544
Well, cops aren't the only ones
that stick together.

28:30.579 --> 28:32.024
So do DAs.

28:32.059 --> 28:34.802
Counselor, a word.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.349
Your DA thinks
she can bully deaf people.

28:40.384 --> 28:42.632
That they don't know their rights.

28:44.141 --> 28:46.313
She is not my DA.

28:46.348 --> 28:48.297
And her fiance was killed.

28:48.332 --> 28:51.204
Then she shouldn't be in the room.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.495
What's going on?

28:54.530 --> 28:56.074
Are you upset with her,

28:56.109 --> 29:00.006
or are you upset that
the killer might be deaf?

29:00.526 --> 29:03.229
Look, Alexandra,
most of what I do is outreach.

29:03.264 --> 29:07.168
I'm more comfortable interpreting
for the community than interrogating it.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.660
You helped us at the rink.

29:08.695 --> 29:11.425
Well, there your partner was right.
That's a public place.

29:11.460 --> 29:14.296
This is completely different.

29:14.782 --> 29:16.915
Shankly was out of line,

29:16.950 --> 29:18.588
but there is still a murderer out there

29:18.623 --> 29:21.749
targeting people who educate
and care for the deaf.

29:21.784 --> 29:23.952
Are you comfortable with that?

29:24.610 --> 29:26.229
Captain.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.795
We've put Larry in holding.

29:27.830 --> 29:30.876
ADA Shankly has agreed
to take a step back.

29:30.911 --> 29:33.432
And, detective, I need a favor.

29:33.467 --> 29:38.704
We're just getting news footage
of a deaf rights protest at Foley square.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.936
Those protestors are performing
for the news cameras.

29:41.971 --> 29:44.295
They've waived their right to privacy.

29:44.330 --> 29:45.418
Okay.

29:45.676 --> 29:47.220
I'll go up.

29:50.470 --> 29:51.948
Sorry if I interrupted.

29:51.983 --> 29:53.805
Oh, you didn't.

29:56.572 --> 29:59.291
He seems like a decent guy.

30:00.371 --> 30:02.312
Yeah, he does.

30:14.597 --> 30:17.293
There, that's the sign for "Larry. "

30:17.479 --> 30:19.502
And that's "innocent. "

30:20.973 --> 30:24.828
And I can't catch it all 'cause
they're moving around so much.

30:24.863 --> 30:27.271
There, her friend's saying,
"how do you know?"

30:30.753 --> 30:33.382
Malia just said she was
with Larry the whole night.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.493
The night Mallory was murdered?

30:35.528 --> 30:36.752
Yes.

30:36.787 --> 30:39.259
Then she just alibied him.

30:40.486 --> 30:43.294
Oh, uh, what about that part?

30:44.007 --> 30:47.097
Malia doesn't want
her boyfriend Tommy to know.

31:05.188 --> 31:06.163
She's mad.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.706
Yeah, I got that.

31:07.741 --> 31:09.226
Larry's gonna be so pissed at me.

31:09.261 --> 31:12.721
About giving him an alibi?
He'll get over it.

31:16.620 --> 31:18.327
Where were you two?

31:18.362 --> 31:20.918
After the cast party,
we went for coffee.

31:20.953 --> 31:22.768
We talked all night.

31:22.803 --> 31:24.584
About the implant?

31:25.134 --> 31:26.683
Yes.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.335
How late?

31:28.602 --> 31:30.959
He walked me home about dawn.

31:31.219 --> 31:36.358
You two were at a coffee shop
from 10 P.M to 6 A.M.?

31:36.393 --> 31:39.201
We went to his place,
but we just talked.

31:39.236 --> 31:41.888
How'd your boyfriend feel about that?

31:42.984 --> 31:44.335
Tommy doesn't know.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.179
He was with Deedee, his cousin.

31:47.214 --> 31:50.127
There was a party for her new baby.

31:50.162 --> 31:53.041
Please don't tell him about Larry.

31:54.252 --> 31:58.327
You're telling us that Larry
couldn't have killed Dr. Mallory

31:58.362 --> 32:02.402
'cause you and Larry were together
all night long talking?

32:03.449 --> 32:05.932
Can anyone confirm this?

32:10.591 --> 32:14.163
Then Tommy is gonna need to confirm
that you were not with him.

32:14.198 --> 32:15.858
I wasn't.

32:16.063 --> 32:19.831
Please don't tell Tommy.
It will only make him worry.

32:24.962 --> 32:27.586
All right, look, here's the problem.

32:28.301 --> 32:31.176
You're telling us
not to speak to Tommy.

32:31.211 --> 32:33.020
Larry won't talk to us.

32:33.055 --> 32:35.436
Your alibi doesn't
make Larry look innocent.

32:35.471 --> 32:38.443
It makes you look guilty.

32:38.478 --> 32:39.502
What?

32:39.537 --> 32:41.540
Mallory knew his killer.

32:41.575 --> 32:43.077
He buzzed him in.

32:43.112 --> 32:44.313
Or her.

32:44.348 --> 32:45.886
If you spent the night with Larry,

32:45.921 --> 32:48.649
how do we know that you didn't
set Dr. Mallory up

32:48.684 --> 32:50.937
so Larry could shoot him?

32:55.329 --> 32:56.232
Hold on.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.285
Slow down, slow down.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.026
I don't, I can't...
what is she saying?

33:00.061 --> 33:00.906
She's freaked out.

33:00.941 --> 33:03.153
She's saying she would
never hurt Dr. Mallory.

33:03.188 --> 33:05.365
Um, something's wrong
with our communication.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.079
She thinks we're
misunderstanding her.

33:10.829 --> 33:14.151
She's asking
if she should get a lawyer.

33:19.892 --> 33:22.222
All right, we'll take a break.

33:25.785 --> 33:27.747
So do we think she's made up

33:27.782 --> 33:30.318
her night with Larry story
to give him an alibi?

33:30.353 --> 33:31.392
Maybe.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.364
- She puts him on a pedestal.
- They all do.

33:33.399 --> 33:35.862
Nobody who was at that cast party
will speak to us.

33:35.897 --> 33:37.590
And Larry, over in holding,

33:37.625 --> 33:40.911
has his hands tied behind his back,
so to speak.

33:40.946 --> 33:43.805
Okay, let's hold Malia as a witness.

33:43.840 --> 33:48.399
She claims Tommy was with his cousin
the night of Mallory's murder.

33:48.434 --> 33:49.735
Go lean on the cousin.

33:49.770 --> 33:53.948
If she thinks Tommy's getting dragged
into a homicide investigation,

33:53.983 --> 33:55.863
she might give us something.

34:00.056 --> 34:02.233
Tommy told me you're trying
to frame Larry.

34:02.268 --> 34:04.233
He doesn't want me talking to you.

34:04.268 --> 34:07.463
Deedee, Larry has so much influence
over his students,

34:07.498 --> 34:10.213
they're willing to go down
for his cause.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.703
If your cousin is not involved
in this murder,

34:12.737 --> 34:15.447
he needs to cooperate.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.538
He's scared.

34:16.572 --> 34:19.021
When he found out you were
holding his friend, he ran away.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.670
I don't know where he is.

34:20.705 --> 34:22.896
Well, then, maybe you can help us?

34:22.931 --> 34:25.618
Do you know where
Tommy was Friday night?

34:25.652 --> 34:26.623
Oh, he was with me.

34:26.658 --> 34:30.277
We had a baby-naming
ceremony for Flavia.

34:30.313 --> 34:32.543
She's beautiful.

34:33.685 --> 34:35.518
She's perfect.

34:35.554 --> 34:37.927
Perfect, you mean, uh...

34:37.962 --> 34:41.257
she was born deaf?

34:42.616 --> 34:46.077
You must celebrate that
in your community.

34:46.112 --> 34:47.342
It's a blessing.

34:47.378 --> 34:51.204
A hearing baby is a time bomb
waiting to go off.

34:52.270 --> 34:53.976
They always leave.

34:54.012 --> 34:56.501
Tommy went through that with his sister.

34:56.536 --> 34:58.529
I don't wish that on anyone.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.553
Tommy has a sister?

35:02.059 --> 35:03.592
Yes. Um...

35:03.627 --> 35:06.518
she was born hearing.
Tommy adored her.

35:06.553 --> 35:10.385
But then she went away to college,
and never came back.

35:11.141 --> 35:14.143
She was 17, he was 12.

35:14.178 --> 35:18.697
He was so alone until Malia
came into his life.

35:20.365 --> 35:22.033
Malia, they seem very close.

35:22.068 --> 35:24.754
She must have come with Tommy
on Friday night to see your baby.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.240
Oh, she couldn't,
it was her opening night.

35:27.275 --> 35:30.040
Um, Tommy went to the cast party,

35:30.075 --> 35:33.162
and he didn't get
to my place until about 10.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.256
Malia never came.

35:35.291 --> 35:38.042
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.213
She may have just alibied her cousin,

35:43.248 --> 35:44.792
but she hung Malia out to dry.

35:44.827 --> 35:46.656
I know Larry's happy to martyr himself,

35:46.691 --> 35:50.579
but I wonder if he's willing
to take Malia down with him.

35:55.530 --> 35:58.653
Can we have an emergency contact?

36:00.823 --> 36:03.011
I'm not answering any questions.

36:03.046 --> 36:05.153
And I'm not eating.
I'm on a hunger strike.

36:05.188 --> 36:07.680
Okay, you're not gonna help yourself.

36:07.715 --> 36:11.429
But you should know
we're about to arrest Malia.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.048
Malia?

36:13.315 --> 36:15.830
- Leave her out of this!
- We'd like to.

36:15.865 --> 36:18.054
But she claims she was
with you Friday night,

36:18.089 --> 36:20.968
which makes her at least an accessory.

36:21.003 --> 36:23.087
She wasn't with me.
She's lying.

36:23.122 --> 36:25.147
She left around 10.

36:25.182 --> 36:28.150
Tell Malia I don't need her help.

36:28.361 --> 36:30.189
Or yours.

36:34.445 --> 36:36.061
- Anything?
- No.

36:36.096 --> 36:39.645
So no murder weapon,
no witnesses, shaky motive.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.624
And contradictory alibis.

36:41.659 --> 36:44.101
Tommy's cousin alibies Tommy,
but not Malia.

36:44.136 --> 36:47.545
Malia alibies Larry,
but Larry rejects her alibi.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.954
It's possible the three of them
are in this together.

36:50.989 --> 36:54.692
There is one way we can
break into their world.

36:54.727 --> 36:58.396
Bring Tommy and Malia in together,
pull them apart.

36:58.431 --> 36:59.695
Yeah.

37:00.539 --> 37:01.838
That's crazy.

37:01.873 --> 37:04.511
Malia didn't kill Dr. Mallory.
Why would she?

37:04.546 --> 37:08.237
We think Dr. Mallory told her
he couldn't do the implant.

37:08.272 --> 37:10.900
No, he didn't.
He said I was a good candidate.

37:10.935 --> 37:12.281
It was all set.

37:12.316 --> 37:15.698
Is that right, Tommy?
Did he say that?

37:15.940 --> 37:18.057
Tommy wasn't there.

37:18.092 --> 37:19.156
You weren't?

37:19.191 --> 37:22.755
Big decision like that,
and you didn't go with your girlfriend?

37:24.055 --> 37:26.468
Look, it wasn't Malia,
it was Larry.

37:26.503 --> 37:29.147
Everyone knew how
he hated those doctors...

37:29.182 --> 37:30.522
and the dean.

37:30.557 --> 37:32.458
That's strange,
'cause Malia told us

37:32.493 --> 37:36.576
that she was with Larry the night
that Dr. Mallory was killed.

37:41.788 --> 37:44.559
She was covering for him.
She was with me.

37:44.594 --> 37:47.128
Visiting your cousin's baby?

37:48.228 --> 37:52.439
Well, the thing is, your cousin
said Malia wasn't there.

37:56.393 --> 37:59.043
Maybe I'm confused.

38:00.095 --> 38:03.707
We were surprised that Malia
didn't visit the baby.

38:03.742 --> 38:05.385
A big event like that,

38:05.420 --> 38:10.290
bringing a deaf child
into the community...

38:11.875 --> 38:14.993
Malia told us she was
up all night with Larry.

38:15.028 --> 38:15.865
Talking.

38:15.900 --> 38:18.745
That's right.
Talking about her implant.

38:18.780 --> 38:21.590
He disapproved of it.
How did you feel?

38:24.932 --> 38:26.855
It's her life,
I was okay with it.

38:26.890 --> 38:30.611
You weren't afraid that
once Malia got her hearing...

38:30.646 --> 38:33.366
that she would abandon you?

38:35.712 --> 38:37.624
Of course not.

38:37.872 --> 38:43.789
Even though your hearing sister
abandoned you the first chance she got?

38:46.041 --> 38:49.031
Tommy doesn't have a sister.

38:50.306 --> 38:52.113
Yes, he does.

38:53.978 --> 38:56.517
His cousin told us.

39:01.534 --> 39:06.014
Tommy, why didn't you tell me?

39:08.098 --> 39:11.246
I didn't tell you
'cause she's dead to me.

39:11.281 --> 39:13.128
She's not one of us.

39:13.163 --> 39:14.975
'cause she's hearing?

39:19.828 --> 39:23.814
Like Malia would be
once she got her implant?

39:29.665 --> 39:31.670
She's saying that
he didn't need to be concerned,

39:31.705 --> 39:34.123
that she never was gonna leave him.

39:36.790 --> 39:38.844
I know what she said.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.754
You didn't want Malia
to get the implant.

39:43.789 --> 39:45.464
Why would you?

39:46.548 --> 39:49.978
You didn't think she needed
to be fixed, did you?

39:50.013 --> 39:52.468
Of course not, she's perfect.

39:54.635 --> 39:59.369
And you thought Dr. Mallory
was destroying all of that, didn't you?

40:05.108 --> 40:07.865
He had no right to ruin our lives!

40:07.900 --> 40:09.865
Tommy, what did you do?

40:09.900 --> 40:11.451
I did it for us.

40:11.486 --> 40:13.908
So we could be together forever!

40:14.151 --> 40:16.578
In our world, not theirs.

40:17.865 --> 40:20.207
You killed him?

40:24.389 --> 40:26.108
I didn't mean to.

40:26.143 --> 40:28.787
I just shot his hand so he
couldn't perform the surgery.

40:28.822 --> 40:31.431
But then he was yelling,
and someone was gonna hear.

40:31.466 --> 40:33.470
I had to stop him.

40:33.689 --> 40:37.085
You stomped on his throat.

40:37.120 --> 40:40.310
He was screaming,
his mouth was open.

40:41.051 --> 40:44.355
But he didn't make a sound.

40:44.645 --> 40:47.831
You knocked out his voice box.

40:51.261 --> 40:54.016
You didn't have to kill him.

40:55.756 --> 40:57.913
Tommy...

40:58.682 --> 41:01.748
you know you weren't gonna lose me.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.590
I love you.

41:17.798 --> 41:21.735
Uh, cuff, cuff him in the front
so he can talk.
