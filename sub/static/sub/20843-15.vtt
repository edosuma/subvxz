Announcer:
<i>Previously on "MasterChef"...</i>

00:03.240 --> 00:04.242
Switch!

00:04.242 --> 00:05.912
‐ Go! Go!
‐ Come on, Jeff!

00:05.912 --> 00:07.181
<i>a high‐speed</i>
<i>tag team challenge...</i>

00:07.181 --> 00:08.416
‐ It ain't gotta be pretty.
‐ Let's go!

00:08.416 --> 00:09.485
I'm moving, dude.
I'm moving.

00:09.485 --> 00:11.256
Shred. Shred.
Get the churros right.

00:11.256 --> 00:13.126
We gotta prioritize here,
buddy.

00:13.126 --> 00:14.262
<i>put the brakes...</i>

00:14.262 --> 00:16.667
‐ Who shredded the lamb?
‐ I did, Chef.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.604
It's like
a can of dog food.

00:18.604 --> 00:19.840
<i>on Caitlin's...</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:21.944
Tonight, you weren't
in this game.

00:21.944 --> 00:22.946
<i>...MasterChef dream.</i>

00:25.518 --> 00:27.154
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:27.154 --> 00:29.292
‐ Is Christina driving?
‐ <i>the top eight...</i>

00:29.292 --> 00:31.897
Welcome to Big Bear Lake.

00:31.897 --> 00:33.300
<i>...go back to basics.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:36.072
This is the great outdoors,
so your kitchen...

00:36.072 --> 00:38.511
‐ Ugh.
‐ ...is a campground.

00:38.511 --> 00:40.915
<i>But in this fish out of water</i>
<i>challenge...</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:43.086
This is so hard
to cook on here.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.155
‐ <i>which team...</i>
‐ Gordon: Potato salad?

00:44.155 --> 00:45.223
<i>will sink...</i>

00:45.223 --> 00:47.261
‐ Stop.
‐ <i>...to the bottom?</i>

00:47.261 --> 00:49.098
Whose idea was that?
Absolute rubbish.

00:57.616 --> 01:00.053
Top eight, baby,
on Big Bear Lake!

01:00.053 --> 01:03.193
It's so pretty.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.963
This is not
downtown LA anymore.

01:04.963 --> 01:08.136
<i>We are in the wilderness</i>
<i>with the beautiful trees,</i>

01:08.136 --> 01:10.374
<i>the water, the crisp air.</i>

01:10.374 --> 01:13.681
<i>You can smell</i>
<i>the sweet, herbal smell</i>
<i>from all the plants.</i>

01:13.681 --> 01:15.585
It's a beautiful,
picture postcard setting.

01:15.585 --> 01:18.724
‐ Amazing.
‐ There's deer tracks!

01:18.724 --> 01:20.928
That's awesome!

01:20.928 --> 01:23.501
Growing up in Illinois,
we just do stuff outside.

01:23.501 --> 01:24.736
That's what we love.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.007
<i>If we weren't hunting,</i>
<i>we were fishing</i>

01:27.007 --> 01:29.378
<i>or picking cherries</i>
<i>and making pie.</i>

01:29.378 --> 01:31.717
So I feel right at home
on Big Bear Lake.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.788
Oh, my God.
Here come the judges.

01:33.788 --> 01:36.527
Oh, my God!
What's up? Hi!

01:36.527 --> 01:38.229
Hey!

01:38.229 --> 01:41.202
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Is Christina driving?

01:41.202 --> 01:44.609
Yeah! Whoo! Get it, girl.

01:44.609 --> 01:46.580
Eboni:
<i>Bring it on in,</i>
<i>girl pow wow.</i>

01:46.580 --> 01:49.118
<i>I like seeing Christina come</i>
<i>in as the captain of the boat.</i>

01:49.118 --> 01:51.289
Mm‐hmm. Fellas, get back.
She doing that.

01:51.289 --> 01:53.594
Hey, guys!

01:53.594 --> 01:56.232
( cheering )

01:56.232 --> 01:58.470
Christina's my girl.
She's my tomboy.

01:58.470 --> 02:01.777
‐ Come on, guys.
‐ Christina! Let's give her
a round of applause.

02:01.777 --> 02:03.413
‐ Yeah, Christina!
‐ Legit.

02:03.413 --> 02:06.052
‐ Good morning.
‐ All: Good morning!

02:06.052 --> 02:08.624
Welcome to gorgeous
Big Bear Lake.

02:08.624 --> 02:10.561
Whoo!

02:10.561 --> 02:12.699
Today you'll be working
in two teams of four,

02:12.699 --> 02:14.870
and you're
gonna be serving some
of the most intimidating,

02:14.870 --> 02:16.573
some of the most experienced,

02:16.573 --> 02:18.476
and definitely the most
attractive guests

02:18.476 --> 02:21.984
we've ever had
in a team challenge.

02:21.984 --> 02:24.956
‐ Us.
‐ ( cheering )

02:24.956 --> 02:26.994
We're honored.

02:26.994 --> 02:29.298
Cate and Dino,
you were the winning team

02:29.298 --> 02:31.469
during that last
team challenge,

02:31.469 --> 02:32.972
so today you will each
captain a team.

02:32.972 --> 02:34.475
Please,
both of you step up here.

02:34.475 --> 02:37.982
Cate: <i>I'm thrilled about</i>
<i>being team captain again.</i>

02:37.982 --> 02:39.586
In my first team challenge
at the peninsula,

02:39.586 --> 02:42.124
<i>I ended up handing</i>
<i>the reigns to Eboni.</i>

02:42.124 --> 02:44.195
<i>So today I need</i>
<i>to prove to the judges</i>

02:44.195 --> 02:46.299
that I can be
a great team captain.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.838
Now, Cate,
out of the two of you,

02:48.838 --> 02:51.375
throughout this competition,
you have had the most wins,

02:51.375 --> 02:54.315
so now you'll get
first pick of your team.

02:54.315 --> 02:57.387
This person is excellent
in the kitchen,

02:57.387 --> 03:01.429
and he has grown so much
in the competition already.

03:01.429 --> 03:04.569
Mr. Jason, I would love
to have you on my team.

03:04.569 --> 03:06.005
‐ Good.
‐ Thank you.

03:06.005 --> 03:07.775
Dino, where we going?

03:07.775 --> 03:11.482
This person's good
with getting that energy up,
motivating us all,

03:11.482 --> 03:13.186
and does pick the slack up
where everybody misses it.

03:13.186 --> 03:14.789
‐ Who is it?
‐ Daniel.

03:14.789 --> 03:16.793
Daniel.
Let's go, buddy.

03:16.793 --> 03:18.831
Welcome to the blue team,
Daniel.

03:18.831 --> 03:20.433
Right, Cate, second pick.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.538
In the last team challenge,

03:22.538 --> 03:25.845
I was struggling with having
that loud, dominant voice,

03:25.845 --> 03:27.782
and she stepped in
and saved my butt,

03:27.782 --> 03:29.018
so, Eboni, get over here.

03:29.018 --> 03:31.455
Wow. Eboni,
welcome to red team.

03:31.455 --> 03:32.992
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

03:32.992 --> 03:33.994
Okay, Dino.

03:33.994 --> 03:36.032
This person's a badass cook.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.702
I'll tell you that.
Yachecia, baby.

03:37.702 --> 03:39.873
Yachecia.
Welcome to the blue team.

03:39.873 --> 03:40.875
Thank you.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.012
So, Cate, last pick.

03:43.012 --> 03:43.914
Dino:
<i>Cate, please.</i>

03:43.914 --> 03:45.083
<i>The worst possible person</i>

03:45.083 --> 03:47.054
I could have
on my team is Jeff.

03:47.054 --> 03:48.891
<i>He's loud, doesn't listen,</i>

03:48.891 --> 03:50.360
<i>and he's always</i>
<i>just running his mouth.</i>

03:50.360 --> 03:52.565
The only time I ever
won a team challenge

03:52.565 --> 03:54.001
was when
I was not on his team.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.276
Gabe, come please
join my team.

03:58.276 --> 03:59.746
Yeah.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.152
Thank you, ma'am.

04:03.152 --> 04:08.229
Okay, so, Dino, hand
the last blue apron to Jeff.

04:08.229 --> 04:10.868
Captains,
please join your teams.
Thank you.

04:13.574 --> 04:14.876
All right,
so now that you know

04:14.876 --> 04:16.412
who you're
gonna be working with,

04:16.412 --> 04:18.416
we're gonna tell you
what you're working with.

04:22.024 --> 04:25.030
‐ Yeah!
‐ Stunning rainbow trout.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.034
‐ Beautiful.
‐ Gorgeous.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.236
An incredible
freshwater fish

04:28.236 --> 04:30.173
that is indigenous
to this beautiful lake.

04:30.173 --> 04:32.845
And we spent all morning
catching them fresh for you.

04:34.214 --> 04:36.385
Each team is responsible
for bringing us

04:36.385 --> 04:39.592
three plates of two
entirely different entrees.

04:39.592 --> 04:41.730
The only thing that should be
the same on both your plates

04:41.730 --> 04:43.967
is the protein.

04:43.967 --> 04:49.278
And I'm sure you've noticed,
there's no MasterChef
kitchen setup here.

04:49.278 --> 04:52.250
And that's because today
you guys are gonna
get back to basics.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.921
This is the great outdoors,

04:53.921 --> 04:56.626
so your kitchen
is a campground.

04:56.626 --> 04:58.262
All right.

04:58.262 --> 04:59.732
Jeff:
<i>I'm super excited for this.</i>

04:59.732 --> 05:02.672
Being an Eagle Scout,
I've done this before.

05:02.672 --> 05:04.909
<i>I've cooked out in the rain,</i>
<i>the snow.</i>

05:04.909 --> 05:08.249
12 years of scouting definitely
prepared me for this moment.

05:08.249 --> 05:10.621
The teams will have
60 minutes today

05:10.621 --> 05:12.592
to prepare three plates

05:12.592 --> 05:15.764
of two fully‐composed
rainbow trout dishes.

05:15.764 --> 05:19.873
Your 60 minutes start...

05:19.873 --> 05:22.277
‐ ...now. Let's go, guys.
‐ Come on, guys.

05:22.277 --> 05:24.248
All right,
I'll grab the fish.
Boys, you get the cooler.

05:24.248 --> 05:25.618
‐ All right, guys.
‐ Whoo!

05:25.618 --> 05:27.387
Let's go, red team.
Let's go, blue team.

05:27.387 --> 05:31.428
‐ This is awesome!
‐ Go, red team!

05:31.428 --> 05:33.232
Here we go.

05:33.232 --> 05:34.569
Okay, we have to do
two elevated dishes.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.640
I was thinking one
a little bit rustic with,

05:36.640 --> 05:38.911
like, a cornmeal crust on it.

05:38.911 --> 05:41.616
And then we could do
a pan‐seared trout

05:41.616 --> 05:43.419
and use those
red bliss potatoes.

05:43.419 --> 05:46.358
‐ Like an elevated potato salad.
‐ Exactly.

05:46.358 --> 05:48.196
What if we did something like‐‐
kind of like a succotash?

05:48.196 --> 05:49.464
They want something
a little bit elevated.

05:49.464 --> 05:51.536
You know,
they want something refined.

05:51.536 --> 05:53.339
We're gonna make it elevated
and we're gonna plate elevated.

05:53.339 --> 05:55.711
Gabe, don't shake
your head, okay?

05:55.711 --> 05:57.047
We're gonna make it elevated.

05:57.047 --> 05:58.282
Gabe:
<i>I'm hearing all these ideas,</i>

05:58.282 --> 05:59.719
I'm seeing how
she's conceptualizing,

05:59.719 --> 06:01.088
<i>and I'm definitely</i>
<i>remembering</i>

06:01.088 --> 06:02.658
<i>how bad</i>
<i>a team captain Cate was</i>

06:02.658 --> 06:03.894
and how bad a team captain
Cate still is.

06:03.894 --> 06:07.635
One, two, three.
Red team!

06:07.635 --> 06:09.606
Yachecia:
What are you thinking?

06:09.606 --> 06:11.610
I wanna bring the elements
of where we're at, okay?

06:11.610 --> 06:13.614
I want it to have asparagus.
I want to chop it.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.517
‐ Have some of it
coming out of...
‐ Like a tree.

06:15.517 --> 06:16.519
the side of the tree,
but some of
the tree fell over.

06:16.519 --> 06:17.588
All right.

06:17.588 --> 06:18.790
Jeff:
<i>Dino has this vision</i>

06:18.790 --> 06:22.598
of transforming nature
to his plate.

06:22.598 --> 06:23.934
We got the greens over here.

06:23.934 --> 06:25.203
We got the little
reds up there.
You got the yellows.

06:25.203 --> 06:26.673
So I was thinking
we could peel these

06:26.673 --> 06:28.710
‐ and put it at
the top of the tree.
‐ Beautiful!

06:28.710 --> 06:32.484
And the rest of my team
is buying into this ( bleep ).

06:32.484 --> 06:35.791
Love the idea of bringing
in the scenery on that one.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.160
<i>This is just childlike.</i>

06:37.160 --> 06:39.231
This is not MasterChef‐worthy.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.736
We have two types of fish.
We got some tin foil.

06:41.736 --> 06:43.306
I think if we do a pinwheel,
we make, like,

06:43.306 --> 06:44.909
a little bit of
a heating pack into it there.

06:44.909 --> 06:46.846
‐ Yes! Yes!
‐ I've done that
before camping.

06:46.846 --> 06:48.517
It can work itself
out very well.

06:48.517 --> 06:51.589
<i>Thank God we've got another</i>
<i>dish that we can do</i>

06:51.589 --> 06:53.092
<i>that can balance out</i>
<i>the weirdness.</i>

06:53.092 --> 06:55.898
This could be
our saving grace.

06:55.898 --> 06:57.868
One, two, three, blue team!

06:57.868 --> 07:00.340
Let's go.
Get that water on the boil.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.310
Now, two fascinating teams.

07:02.310 --> 07:03.346
Blue team, Dino.

07:03.346 --> 07:04.982
I'm working
on one aspect at a time.

07:04.982 --> 07:06.485
I need to make sure
they're all together.

07:06.485 --> 07:07.487
You have three
strong personalities.

07:07.487 --> 07:09.726
You have Dino,
Yachecia, and Jeff.

07:09.726 --> 07:11.128
And Jeff has not shown us

07:11.128 --> 07:12.798
that he can take
direction well.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.370
‐ True, true.
‐ Uh, Jeff remains
the last‐picked

07:15.370 --> 07:16.405
time and time again.

07:16.405 --> 07:17.975
Hey, hey.

07:17.975 --> 07:19.579
We need the hot water
for the asparagus, pal.

07:19.579 --> 07:21.348
Oh, no, I was gonna pan‐sear
the asparagus for that one.

07:21.348 --> 07:22.317
You need
to blanch 'em first.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.920
I don't know about that.

07:23.920 --> 07:24.989
You need
to blanch them first.

07:24.989 --> 07:27.060
Red team,
captained by Cate.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.730
Never lost
a team challenge before.

07:28.730 --> 07:30.066
I'd wanna be on that team.

07:30.066 --> 07:32.404
Filleting fish on a stump.

07:32.404 --> 07:34.842
Let's not forget
she's more comfortable here

07:34.842 --> 07:36.679
out in the wild than she is
in the kitchen.

07:36.679 --> 07:38.683
She grew up fishing
with her father.

07:38.683 --> 07:40.453
She knows this kind
of territory inside out.

07:40.453 --> 07:42.290
How many filets off each side?

07:42.290 --> 07:43.794
Do you think we can
get two off each side?

07:43.794 --> 07:45.396
I think we can get two
off each side.

07:45.396 --> 07:46.933
Now, this team challenge
is much different than

07:46.933 --> 07:48.737
other team challenges,
right?

07:48.737 --> 07:52.210
To be a great chef,
you don't need a bevy
of great equipment.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.982
The delicious ingredients
and how you prepare them,
how you season them,

07:54.982 --> 07:56.753
that's what speaks.

07:56.753 --> 07:59.324
Oh, my God.
This is so hard
to cook on here.

08:01.896 --> 08:03.867
Red team, right, guys,
stand up.

08:03.867 --> 08:05.537
30 seconds with you all.
Quick.

08:05.537 --> 08:06.940
Describe the dishes, Cate.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.743
We have a light,
cornmeal‐crusted‐‐

08:08.743 --> 08:10.514
Stop. Cornmeal?

08:10.514 --> 08:13.385
‐ Yes.
‐ On rainbow trout?

08:13.385 --> 08:14.755
Yes.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.559
We don't put cornmeal
on a rainbow trout.

08:16.559 --> 08:17.795
Whose idea was that?

08:17.795 --> 08:18.897
‐ Mine.
‐ Cate's.

08:18.897 --> 08:19.899
Anybody else agree with it?

08:19.899 --> 08:20.968
No, I don't agree with it.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.305
Speak up!

08:23.305 --> 08:24.876
Gabriel: <i>I'm getting</i>
<i>really frustrated.</i>

08:24.876 --> 08:26.111
If we don't bring this fish up

08:26.111 --> 08:27.447
to the level
it's supposed to be,

08:27.447 --> 08:29.150
<i>we're gonna be</i>
<i>in the pressure test,</i>

08:29.150 --> 08:30.621
and it could be
sending me home potentially.

08:30.621 --> 08:32.591
Cate, smarten up.

08:41.743 --> 08:45.149
Cate, we don't put cornmeal
on a rainbow trout.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.686
We're going panko. Got it.

08:46.686 --> 08:47.821
Tell me about
the second dish.

08:47.821 --> 08:49.491
Beautiful, pan‐seared trout

08:49.491 --> 08:52.363
with a nice
warm potato side

08:52.363 --> 08:54.502
with some crème fraiche
and dill.

08:54.502 --> 08:55.837
What, like a potato salad?

08:55.837 --> 08:57.140
Like an elevated potato salad.

08:57.140 --> 08:58.944
Guys, we're not on a picnic.

08:58.944 --> 09:01.114
That's what I said, Chef.

09:01.114 --> 09:05.156
I told Cate potato salad
was a horrible idea,

09:05.156 --> 09:06.759
and now it's coming back
to bite her in the ass.

09:06.759 --> 09:09.732
‐ Roasted potatoes...
‐ I said do a hash, Chef.

09:09.732 --> 09:11.636
‐ A hash.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

09:11.636 --> 09:12.972
<i>I really wanna</i>
<i>just tell Cate,</i>

09:12.972 --> 09:14.441
<i>"You're already done</i>
<i>being captain,</i>

09:14.441 --> 09:15.978
I'll take over,
because these ideas
are horrible."

09:15.978 --> 09:18.282
Step up and get yourselves
on this plate.

09:18.282 --> 09:19.986
‐ Is that clear?
‐ Yes, Chef.

09:19.986 --> 09:22.323
‐ Man.
‐ Get your hash idea.

09:22.323 --> 09:23.827
I will do
a sweet yellow pepper,
and I might

09:23.827 --> 09:25.029
take something else
and throw it in the hash.
Sound good?

09:25.029 --> 09:26.264
‐ Yeah.
‐ All right, thank you.

09:26.264 --> 09:28.002
‐ Talk to me, though, okay?
‐ Thank you.

09:28.002 --> 09:31.441
All right, blue team,
two different entrees.

09:31.441 --> 09:32.811
What are you guys making?

09:32.811 --> 09:35.349
We're doing
a very inspired dish
from nature, you know?

09:35.349 --> 09:38.556
The first one is a pan‐seared,
crispy seasoned trout.

09:38.556 --> 09:40.560
Talk me through what it's
actually gonna look like.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.065
Over here. Over here.

09:43.065 --> 09:44.869
So we're doing
the fish right here
sort of at a bias.

09:44.869 --> 09:47.240
We're gonna let
a couple of branches
of asparagus come out,

09:47.240 --> 09:48.877
but it's gonna be
laying like that.

09:48.877 --> 09:51.381
Plus the trees.
You see the orange over there?

09:51.381 --> 09:54.387
You see the red up there.
I got the tomatoes to sort of
build that groundwork.

09:54.387 --> 09:57.661
When you're too literal
sometimes about how you plate,

09:57.661 --> 10:00.266
then it feels
a little childlike.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.234
And what's dish two?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.538
Dish two was the pinwheel.

10:02.538 --> 10:04.542
Remember, you're cooking
at a campground,

10:04.542 --> 10:05.877
but we're not looking
for campground food.

10:05.877 --> 10:08.449
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ We won't disappoint you.

10:11.288 --> 10:13.960
We just need to get some
fish on, guys. Let's go.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.962
Cate, let me know
if you need help, okay?

10:14.962 --> 10:16.966
It's fine.
Guys, I got this.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.035
Don't say it's fine
if you're not done.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.404
I am going, guys.

10:19.404 --> 10:23.479
Red team, blue team,
ten minutes to go.

10:23.479 --> 10:26.151
Danny, we need to start
frying those things.

10:26.151 --> 10:27.988
Does somebody wanna help me
take the pin bones out?

10:27.988 --> 10:29.925
‐ There's a lot in here.
‐ Yep.

10:29.925 --> 10:32.063
Daniel:
<i>I thought filleting the fish</i>
<i>was gonna be the tough part,</i>

10:32.063 --> 10:34.568
But it turns out that trying
to get all these pin bones out
is the tough part.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.138
There's a lot.
There's definitely
a lot in here.

10:36.138 --> 10:37.574
Yeah, there are.

10:37.574 --> 10:39.678
<i>When you're crouched over</i>
<i>on top of stumps</i>

10:39.678 --> 10:41.816
<i>that are sunken into the mud.</i>

10:41.816 --> 10:43.318
Your feet are slipping around.

10:43.318 --> 10:45.156
<i>You're trying to hold on</i>
<i>to this fish</i>

10:45.156 --> 10:46.993
<i>that's wider</i>
<i>than the surface</i>

10:46.993 --> 10:48.797
<i>that you're working on,</i>

10:48.797 --> 10:50.299
and it's definitely
a race against the clock.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.538
‐ It takes so long!
‐ I understand,

10:52.538 --> 10:55.276
but we can't do a pinwheel
that's got bones in it.

10:55.276 --> 10:57.180
Gordon:
Five minutes to go!

10:59.952 --> 11:02.991
‐ Cate, you got to move, baby.
‐ Okay. Okay. Here, you can‐‐

11:02.991 --> 11:05.162
‐ Panko? Got you.
‐ Yeah. Here's your herbs.

11:05.162 --> 11:06.464
Gotta get fish going.

11:06.464 --> 11:08.101
Hey, we need to have
something to serve.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.404
I'm dropping it now.

11:11.274 --> 11:13.445
‐ I got it here.
‐ You got it?

11:13.445 --> 11:15.015
You're running around.
That's why I'm asking.

11:15.015 --> 11:17.253
Gabriel:
<i>I'm definitely</i>
<i>shocked and stoked</i>

11:17.253 --> 11:19.290
from the time that we started
and how in disarray we were,

11:19.290 --> 11:21.829
<i>and now we're at least</i>
<i>getting some kind of a flow</i>
<i>and getting food out.</i>

11:21.829 --> 11:24.500
It looks beautiful,
but I'm not as sure
about the flavors.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.806
Whoo!
This looks good.

11:26.806 --> 11:29.210
Two and a half minutes to go.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.714
Two and a half minutes.
Hurry!

11:32.483 --> 11:33.519
Dino:
You need to finish those fish
soon as possible.

11:33.519 --> 11:35.289
Yachecia:
Make sure it's cooked.

11:35.289 --> 11:37.493
‐ It's coming.
‐ That's crispy,
crispy, crispy.

11:37.493 --> 11:38.730
That's beautiful.

11:38.730 --> 11:40.800
‐ Come on, come on, come on.
‐ Come on, guys.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.738
‐ We need a spoon.
‐ We got this. We got this.
We got this.

11:42.738 --> 11:44.340
Make it look nice.
Let's go. Let's go.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.512
Drizzle. Olive oil.
Watch out. Watch out.

11:46.512 --> 11:48.516
Take this one off,
with that big‐ass stem
right there.

11:48.516 --> 11:51.054
‐ Ten.
‐ Ten seconds. Ten seconds.

11:51.054 --> 11:53.526
Judges:
Nine, eight, seven,

11:53.526 --> 11:56.264
six, five, four,

11:56.264 --> 11:58.536
three, two, one.

11:58.536 --> 11:59.939
( air horn blows )

11:59.939 --> 12:01.676
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Yeah!

12:01.676 --> 12:02.811
‐ Whoo!
‐ Hands up!

12:02.811 --> 12:05.049
‐ Yeah! Aah!
‐ Whoo!

12:05.049 --> 12:07.888
‐ Good job. Good job.
‐ Red team, blue team,

12:07.888 --> 12:11.161
please carry your dishes
over to our table.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.465
‐ Don't mess it up. Careful.
‐ Gotcha.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.469
Be careful.
Keep looking down.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.808
Cate:
<i>We definitely have</i>
<i>two elevated,</i>

12:17.808 --> 12:19.745
<i>restaurant‐quality dishes</i>

12:19.745 --> 12:22.684
<i>that not only look</i>
<i>visually appealing,</i>

12:22.684 --> 12:23.886
they taste really good.

12:23.886 --> 12:25.422
Let's go,
blue team, please.

12:25.422 --> 12:27.426
Dino:
<i>I am beyond happy right now.</i>

12:27.426 --> 12:31.535
<i>This is some five‐star,</i>
<i>restaurant quality food.</i>

12:31.535 --> 12:33.372
<i>But I have my vision on</i>
<i>what I wanted with a plate,</i>

12:33.372 --> 12:35.543
<i>and it looks</i>
<i>like a masterpiece.</i>

12:35.543 --> 12:36.879
It's beauty on a plate.

12:36.879 --> 12:39.718
Gordon:
Let's go.

12:39.718 --> 12:45.429
Today we asked each team
to make two stunning entrees.

12:45.429 --> 12:47.199
But there's a twist.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.141
We only want to taste

12:51.141 --> 12:54.447
one stunning dish
from each team.

12:56.117 --> 12:58.756
That's right,
you must decide which

12:58.756 --> 13:03.365
of those two dishes
is your best effort.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.737
Jeff: <i>Dino's weird take</i>
<i>on nature on a plate,</i>

13:05.737 --> 13:08.341
or my dish which is light,

13:08.341 --> 13:10.279
<i>refreshing, beautiful.</i>

13:10.279 --> 13:12.016
This is, like,
a clear no‐brainer.

13:21.234 --> 13:25.910
Today, we asked each team
to make two stunning entrees,

13:25.910 --> 13:28.315
but we only want to taste

13:28.315 --> 13:31.622
one dish from each team.

13:31.622 --> 13:34.227
All of you,
take a very serious moment

13:34.227 --> 13:38.135
and start coming up
with a consensus.

13:38.135 --> 13:39.103
Right, so what are you
thinking, Dino?

13:39.103 --> 13:40.607
Both:
What are you thinking, Dino?

13:40.607 --> 13:42.476
We do have a lot of class
with the sear,

13:42.476 --> 13:43.813
because it sort of brings
in the whole, you know,

13:43.813 --> 13:45.249
what we're surrounded in.

13:45.249 --> 13:46.919
My vote's over here
with your dish.

13:46.919 --> 13:48.255
Okay. What about you?

13:48.255 --> 13:50.359
I‐‐ I do believe
in these ones here.

13:50.359 --> 13:52.496
I think we have
a lot going on here.

13:52.496 --> 13:53.833
But this has the story.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.337
The story is just one thing,
but a flavor is another.

13:58.008 --> 13:59.778
Are you kidding me?

13:59.778 --> 14:01.982
<i>My dish</i>
<i>is MasterChef‐worthy.</i>

14:01.982 --> 14:04.320
<i>Dino's dish is just weird.</i>

14:04.320 --> 14:05.957
<i>I am so frustrated right now.</i>

14:05.957 --> 14:07.594
Three against one
at this point.

14:07.594 --> 14:08.629
‐ One team, one dish.
‐ One team, one dish.

14:08.629 --> 14:10.800
Terrible.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.305
‐ All the flavors are on both.
‐ We have two beautiful dishes.

14:13.305 --> 14:15.275
Yeah, the flavors
are all there in both dishes.

14:15.275 --> 14:17.647
But I think for more elegance,
let's go with the white plate.

14:17.647 --> 14:19.350
‐ The white place because‐‐
‐ It's kind of a easy decision.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.087
Agreed.

14:21.087 --> 14:22.857
Cate:
<i>This is a no‐brainer.</i>

14:22.857 --> 14:24.995
They both taste really good,

14:24.995 --> 14:28.603
but our pan‐seared trout
is the winning dish.

14:28.603 --> 14:31.207
Right. Red team, blue team,
happy with the decisions?

14:31.207 --> 14:32.209
All:
Yes, Chef.

14:32.209 --> 14:34.681
Dino, please bring up the dish

14:34.681 --> 14:37.052
that you'd like the judges
to taste to our table please.

14:42.964 --> 14:45.570
Thank you.
Please describe the dish.

14:45.570 --> 14:48.643
A pan‐seared
crispy‐skinned rainbow trout

14:48.643 --> 14:52.016
on a bed of fennel,
basmati rice, and asparagus,

14:52.016 --> 14:55.355
Italian squash,
and the heirloom carrots.

14:55.355 --> 14:57.259
Visually, it's not
the most stunning dish,

14:57.259 --> 14:58.663
but let's get in there
and taste it, shall we?

14:58.663 --> 15:01.000
That's what counts.

15:04.841 --> 15:05.843
Mm.

15:08.281 --> 15:09.885
Um, the actual fish
is seasoned beautifully.

15:09.885 --> 15:11.789
‐ Who seasoned the fish?
‐ That would be me, Chef.

15:11.789 --> 15:13.158
The big issue I've got

15:13.158 --> 15:16.899
is that the whole dish
is missing citrus.

15:16.899 --> 15:20.172
It needs the acidity,
and there's not one ounce
of lemon or lime,

15:20.172 --> 15:22.343
and so
it's actually quite dull.

15:22.343 --> 15:26.150
The cooking of the trout
is just exceptional.

15:26.150 --> 15:27.587
That's, like,
medium‐rare, medium,

15:27.587 --> 15:29.591
which, that's how I like
to eat my trout personally.

15:29.591 --> 15:31.094
Thank you, Chef.
We wanted to respect it.

15:31.094 --> 15:33.365
What I really think
is a true high point

15:33.365 --> 15:34.735
of this dish is this squash.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.705
It is so lovely.
It's delicate.

15:36.705 --> 15:40.445
It's that one part of the dish
that I keep coming back to.

15:40.445 --> 15:43.451
My trout was cooked okay,
but every bite

15:43.451 --> 15:45.923
of rainbow trout I had
had pin bones in it.

15:47.727 --> 15:49.463
Which is not the kind
of texture you're looking for

15:49.463 --> 15:50.600
when you want texture
in a dish.

15:53.071 --> 15:54.473
Jeff, can you do me
a big favor please?

15:54.473 --> 15:56.812
‐ Yes.
‐ Can you bring us one dish

15:56.812 --> 15:59.885
that you left behind please?
Thank you.

15:59.885 --> 16:01.722
Can you describe it please?

16:01.722 --> 16:03.324
It's a rainbow trout pinwheel

16:03.324 --> 16:05.596
with a grapefruit
crème fraiche stuffing

16:05.596 --> 16:08.736
over spice‐roasted red potatoes
that were kinda fanned out,

16:08.736 --> 16:10.205
little asparagus,
and the edible flowers.

16:11.508 --> 16:12.510
Thank you.

16:14.346 --> 16:17.119
Red team. Please, Kate,
present your dishes.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.562
Kate, please describe the dish.

16:21.562 --> 16:26.471
We have a fennel and coriander
pan‐seared rainbow trout

16:26.471 --> 16:29.076
with caramelized
heirloom carrots

16:29.076 --> 16:31.247
and a sundrop tomato relish.

16:31.247 --> 16:32.416
Red team,
let's get one thing right.

16:32.416 --> 16:33.986
The dish looks stunning.

16:33.986 --> 16:35.923
Love the bright,
visual colors.

16:35.923 --> 16:39.330
It's exactly the way
fish should be plated,
with finesse.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.635
The downside is
my fish has been scored
way too deeply,

16:41.635 --> 16:43.906
so it's been hacked
as opposed to being scored.

16:43.906 --> 16:47.312
That could lead
to the fish becoming
overcooked too quickly.

16:47.312 --> 16:49.784
I believe I cooked it properly
at medium rare. Just‐‐

16:49.784 --> 16:52.122
Well, I'll tell you that
if you let me cut in.

16:52.122 --> 16:54.260
Thank you.

16:54.260 --> 16:58.001
The actual fish, yeah,
you're lucky. It's pink.

17:03.111 --> 17:04.146
( fork clinks )

17:04.146 --> 17:06.417
‐ You guys hear that?
‐ Yes, Chef.

17:06.417 --> 17:08.822
So it's like
you've just thrown
more carrots at the end.

17:08.822 --> 17:12.429
Great shame.
It's just a perfect way
how to screw a dish.

17:12.429 --> 17:17.272
Bad news is that my fish
was definitely overcooked.

17:17.272 --> 17:19.410
However, the fish itself
was delicious.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.013
The skin was crispy.

17:21.013 --> 17:22.650
I love the tomatoes.
I love the fennel.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.255
The carrots don't
really need to be there.

17:25.255 --> 17:26.792
You had some highs,
you had some lows.

17:28.929 --> 17:31.133
I gotta say, this fennel,

17:31.133 --> 17:33.271
it's just buttery
and melting in my mouth.

17:33.271 --> 17:34.306
It's probably one
of the more delicious things

17:34.306 --> 17:36.043
I've eaten throughout
this competition.

17:36.043 --> 17:37.814
Really remarkable cooking.

17:39.116 --> 17:42.189
Thank you, Chef.
Really nice job, guys.

17:42.189 --> 17:44.193
Both teams,
go and get some fresh air,

17:44.193 --> 17:46.898
'cause we need to argue now
on which team

17:46.898 --> 17:48.001
put their best dish forward.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.573
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Thank you.

17:50.573 --> 17:51.908
Right, now,
red team, visually,

17:51.908 --> 17:53.378
it looked like
restaurant quality.

17:53.378 --> 17:56.217
The sauce was mind‐blowing.
The carrots were dreadful.

17:56.217 --> 17:59.423
For me, the cooking
of the rainbow trout
was spot‐on.

17:59.423 --> 18:01.160
‐ The skin was crispy.
‐ Really?

18:01.160 --> 18:03.197
And mine was not scored
as deeply as yours.

18:03.197 --> 18:05.301
The fact that we presented
that was great,

18:05.301 --> 18:07.172
and, win or lose, like,
I'm so proud of you guys.

18:07.172 --> 18:09.511
Now the blue team,
I was impressed

18:09.511 --> 18:11.447
with the presentation of
the dish they put forward.

18:11.447 --> 18:12.884
Aarón:
I thought the shaving

18:12.884 --> 18:14.219
of the yellow squash
was beautiful.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.221
It was well‐seasoned.

18:15.221 --> 18:16.858
It was scented
with fennel beautifully.

18:16.858 --> 18:19.296
I have not won a team challenge.
I wanna win a team challenge.

18:19.296 --> 18:21.802
‐ Of course.
‐ Big problem from
the blue team for me,

18:21.802 --> 18:24.039
they left their best dish
on those tree stumps.

18:24.039 --> 18:26.912
That pinwheel was delicious.

18:26.912 --> 18:29.016
I still think
we made the right decision.

18:29.016 --> 18:30.385
Have we come to a consensus?

18:30.385 --> 18:32.155
‐ I think so, yeah.
‐ Yes, we have come.

18:32.155 --> 18:33.892
Red team, blue team,
we've made a decision.

18:33.892 --> 18:34.728
Come on over please.
Thank you.

18:40.706 --> 18:42.409
Right. Well done.

18:42.409 --> 18:44.446
This was a very close race.
Let's get that right.

18:44.446 --> 18:46.952
But we have come
to a decision.

18:46.952 --> 18:48.589
The winning team
that will advance

18:48.589 --> 18:50.693
into the top seven
of the biggest
cooking competition

18:50.693 --> 18:52.295
anywhere in the world
and will not face

18:52.295 --> 18:55.268
that dreaded pressure test...

18:55.268 --> 18:56.270
that team is...

18:59.711 --> 19:01.715
Congratulations...

19:04.721 --> 19:07.092
‐ ...red team!
‐ ( cheering )

19:07.092 --> 19:10.365
Group hug! We won!
Good job, you guys!

19:10.365 --> 19:12.269
Uh, red team, well done.

19:12.269 --> 19:15.341
That that dish
looked restaurant quality,
tasted immaculate,

19:15.341 --> 19:17.947
and that sauce was incredible.

19:19.584 --> 19:22.557
Blue team,
all three of us felt

19:22.557 --> 19:27.232
that we tasted
your weakest dish

19:27.232 --> 19:30.205
because the flavor
in that second dish

19:30.205 --> 19:33.044
that you chose to leave
behind was outstanding.

19:33.044 --> 19:35.716
And now all four of you

19:35.716 --> 19:37.720
will face this
dreaded pressure test

19:37.720 --> 19:40.491
back in
the MasterChef kitchen.

19:40.491 --> 19:43.097
But first, get back in
your kitchens and clean up.

19:43.097 --> 19:46.270
Red team,
go and have some fun
on the water.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.274
My boat is over there.
It awaits you. Off you go.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.111
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ All right, thank you.

19:50.111 --> 19:51.948
‐ Can I drive? I'm driving.
‐ Thank you.

19:51.948 --> 19:54.152
I've continued
my winning streak.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.691
I've won every
team challenge this far,

19:56.691 --> 19:58.862
<i>and I finally</i>
<i>led a team to victory</i>

19:58.862 --> 20:00.866
<i>and stayed the captain.</i>

20:00.866 --> 20:02.302
So I'm feeling super great
right now.

20:04.006 --> 20:05.041
Jason:
Do you guys know how to swim?

20:07.713 --> 20:11.220
I'm tired of losing.
I've been on a losing team
every single time.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.625
Daniel:
<i>Jeff is so upset.</i>

20:13.625 --> 20:15.729
He's acting
like a five‐year‐old

20:15.729 --> 20:17.232
who didn't get to go
on the field trip.

20:17.232 --> 20:18.702
There's different ways
to handle it, man.

20:18.702 --> 20:21.307
You could hold your head high,
know you did a great job,

20:21.307 --> 20:22.910
go back tomorrow
and fight for your life,

20:22.910 --> 20:24.714
or you could sit here
and you can bitch and moan

20:24.714 --> 20:26.551
that you're not
in the boat, buddy.

20:26.551 --> 20:28.387
You make it sound like
you're the only one

20:28.387 --> 20:29.691
who wanted to win
and doesn't like losing.

20:29.691 --> 20:31.728
Yep, that's right, guys.

20:31.728 --> 20:33.097
I'm‐‐ I'm done.

20:54.439 --> 20:58.047
Come on down, please, guys.
Line up. Thank you.

20:58.047 --> 21:01.086
Big Bear definitely turned
into big disappointment,
and I'm pissed.

21:01.086 --> 21:02.355
Gordon:
Let's go.

21:02.355 --> 21:04.560
Jeff: <i>The dish that</i>
<i>we left to the side,</i>

21:04.560 --> 21:08.267
<i>my dish, could have won us</i>
<i>the entire challenge.</i>

21:08.267 --> 21:10.839
<i>I just wish my team</i>
<i>had believed more in me,</i>

21:10.839 --> 21:12.275
and I don't know
if I got it in me

21:12.275 --> 21:13.210
to do this right now.

21:16.718 --> 21:18.087
For your pressure test tonight

21:18.087 --> 21:21.226
you'll be making something
from my wheelhouse,

21:21.226 --> 21:24.801
an extremely‐technical,
outrageously difficult...

21:24.801 --> 21:28.775
incredible box...

21:28.775 --> 21:31.548
of chocolate truffles.

21:31.548 --> 21:32.650
‐ Whoa!
‐ Ooh.

21:34.052 --> 21:37.058
Now, rich, sweet, decadent,

21:37.058 --> 21:39.062
there are nine truffles
in this box‐‐

21:39.062 --> 21:41.266
three each of
three different flavors.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.670
Now, each has
a different coating,

21:42.670 --> 21:44.239
and of course,
a different center.

21:45.742 --> 21:48.314
This one is
a dark chocolate truffle

21:48.314 --> 21:50.619
with a homemade
honeycomb exterior.

21:50.619 --> 21:52.455
‐ Oh! Wow.
‐ Oh, nice.

21:52.455 --> 21:54.660
You can tell how velvety
and rich and luscious

21:54.660 --> 21:57.499
and smooth that inner
dark chocolate ganache is.

21:57.499 --> 21:59.136
‐ ( whistles )
‐ Delicious.

21:59.136 --> 22:01.608
Now this next one
is a magnificent

22:01.608 --> 22:03.477
milk chocolate truffle
enrobed in cocoa powder.

22:03.477 --> 22:04.547
Yes.

22:04.547 --> 22:08.087
This truffle has
a little bit of smoked salt,

22:08.087 --> 22:10.057
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ bourbon, and toasted pecans

22:10.057 --> 22:11.961
folded into that ganache.

22:11.961 --> 22:15.067
‐ Ooh.
‐ Both: Beautiful.

22:15.067 --> 22:18.675
And then last,
but certainly not least,

22:18.675 --> 22:20.746
this beauty.

22:20.746 --> 22:21.814
‐ That's beautiful.
‐ ( whistles )

22:21.814 --> 22:23.317
It's a white chocolate
truffle.

22:23.317 --> 22:27.325
This one has the sweetest
white chocolate

22:27.325 --> 22:29.630
and cherry truffle center.

22:29.630 --> 22:31.033
Ooh.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.536
All three are equally velvety,

22:32.536 --> 22:34.774
intense,
and utterly delicious.

22:34.774 --> 22:38.214
And now you have
to replicate them exactly,

22:38.214 --> 22:40.652
and you'll have
60 minutes to do it.

22:40.652 --> 22:42.890
And trust me,
that won't be easy.

22:42.890 --> 22:45.228
‐ Mm‐mm‐mm.
‐ Head to your stations please.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.367
Come on, guys.
Y'all got this.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.837
Eboni:
<i>They all better focus.</i>

22:49.837 --> 22:51.674
<i>Jeff has struggled</i>
<i>with desserts.</i>

22:51.674 --> 22:53.812
<i>This is Daniel's first</i>
<i>pressure test.</i>

22:53.812 --> 22:56.250
<i>Yachecia thinks</i>
<i>that she's a good baker,</i>

22:56.250 --> 22:58.320
but I don't think she usually
gets her measurements together.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.726
<i>And Dino seems</i>
<i>to like to prance</i>

23:00.726 --> 23:01.761
<i>a little more than cook.</i>

23:01.761 --> 23:03.531
I don't know who gonna win.

23:03.531 --> 23:05.869
At your stations,
you have everything you need

23:05.869 --> 23:08.808
to make a perfect box
of truffles.

23:08.808 --> 23:10.646
‐ Is everyone ready?
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:10.646 --> 23:14.386
Your 60 minutes starts...

23:14.386 --> 23:16.658
now!

23:16.658 --> 23:17.893
Come on, guys.
You got this.

23:17.893 --> 23:18.895
Good job, guys.

23:23.370 --> 23:26.076
Now, box of truffles,
this is, for me,

23:26.076 --> 23:27.078
one of the most technical,

23:27.078 --> 23:28.581
one of the most
feared desserts.

23:28.581 --> 23:29.717
Christina:
Absolutely.

23:29.717 --> 23:30.752
So three different
types of truffles,

23:30.752 --> 23:32.355
where do they start?

23:32.355 --> 23:33.090
Christina:
First thing
is that honeycomb.

23:33.090 --> 23:34.259
It's a sugar syrup.

23:34.259 --> 23:35.662
A little bit
of white vinegar.

23:35.662 --> 23:38.033
It gets cooked
to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

23:38.033 --> 23:40.605
Sink it in the water,
and then add baking soda,

23:40.605 --> 23:43.410
which is going to cause
the mixture to erupt,
to aerate.

23:43.410 --> 23:45.549
It becomes very brittle,
it gets poured out,

23:45.549 --> 23:47.553
and that's gonna need
about 20 minutes to cool down

23:47.553 --> 23:49.957
before it can even be used
as an enrobing element

23:49.957 --> 23:51.393
for that
dark chocolate ganache.

23:51.393 --> 23:52.730
‐ There you go.
‐ Good job, Yachecia.

23:52.730 --> 23:54.900
Second up,
that chocolate ganache.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.136
Gotta get that ganache made,

23:56.136 --> 23:58.207
chocolate,
heavy cream, butter,

23:58.207 --> 24:00.579
heat up the liquids,
pour it over the chocolate,

24:00.579 --> 24:01.614
let the heat penetrate,

24:01.614 --> 24:03.651
and then very gently
start to whisk.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.388
Now the ganaches
all need to be done

24:05.388 --> 24:06.891
in the first 30 minutes.

24:06.891 --> 24:08.828
We will be able to tell
whose got it and who doesn't

24:08.828 --> 24:11.066
by how quickly they get
their ganaches made

24:11.066 --> 24:13.003
and put in the blast chiller.

24:13.003 --> 24:15.374
Just under 15 minutes gone.

24:15.374 --> 24:17.713
45 minutes to go.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.184
You doing good, Yachecia.

24:21.687 --> 24:23.257
‐ All right, Jeff.
‐ How are ya?

24:23.257 --> 24:25.060
You're kinda moving slow,

24:25.060 --> 24:26.764
and it's not
a molasses challenge.

24:26.764 --> 24:29.068
‐ What's going on?
Have you given up?
‐ I'm not giving up.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.939
I just don't wanna
be here right now
doing this challenge.

24:30.939 --> 24:33.578
I get the vibe that you're
sort of working angry tonight

24:33.578 --> 24:35.114
‐ with these truffles.
‐ Yeah.

24:35.114 --> 24:36.784
If we had served the dish
that was the right dish
to go with,

24:36.784 --> 24:38.788
we totally wouldn't
have been in this pressure test

24:38.788 --> 24:41.326
with a chance of going home.
It stinks.

24:41.326 --> 24:43.798
No matter how
you're feeling right now,
you gotta speed up.

24:43.798 --> 24:45.267
I need all three
of those ganaches

24:45.267 --> 24:47.639
in the fridge
in the next 15 minutes.

24:47.639 --> 24:48.741
Ya gotta go, bud.

24:48.741 --> 24:50.077
‐ Okay?
‐ Will do. Thank you.

24:51.814 --> 24:53.518
‐ Miss Yachecia.
‐ Yes, Chef.

24:53.518 --> 24:55.154
Talk to me.
Have you made
truffles before?

24:55.154 --> 24:57.091
No, I have not, Chef.

24:57.091 --> 24:58.695
All right, so this is
your third pressure test.

24:58.695 --> 25:00.665
‐ It is.
‐ Do you feel that gives
you an advantage here?

25:00.665 --> 25:03.036
I think it does,
because I know what it feels
like to be down here.

25:03.036 --> 25:05.241
I don't like it,
but I've been known

25:05.241 --> 25:07.111
to perform down here
every single time.

25:07.111 --> 25:08.380
Well, you got one thing
going for you right now.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.750
You're using
Mexican chocolate,

25:09.750 --> 25:11.654
which is the best chocolate
in the whole world.

25:11.654 --> 25:13.090
( laughs )
Absolutely, Chef.

25:13.090 --> 25:16.096
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

25:16.096 --> 25:17.098
Come on, Yachecia.

25:19.937 --> 25:22.008
‐ Right, Daniel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:22.008 --> 25:23.611
First pressure test.
Are you ready to leave
this competition now?

25:23.611 --> 25:25.782
Absolutely not, Chef.

25:25.782 --> 25:27.786
Pressure test is where
a lot of the competitors
have proven themselves,

25:27.786 --> 25:29.289
so I'm actually kinda
looking forward to this.

25:29.289 --> 25:30.759
I feel very confident
in what I'm doing.

25:30.759 --> 25:32.529
So honeycomb done? Good.

25:32.529 --> 25:33.932
Correct. I just need
to let this sit.

25:33.932 --> 25:34.934
Get that nice and cold.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.438
I have most
of my ganaches done.

25:37.438 --> 25:38.808
My milk chocolate already
has the pecans

25:38.808 --> 25:40.377
and the smoked salt
and the bourbon in here,

25:40.377 --> 25:41.881
and I'm gonna
leave this to set.

25:41.881 --> 25:44.319
‐ What are you worried about?
‐ Not much.

25:44.319 --> 25:45.622
I'm actually feeling
really good right now.

25:45.622 --> 25:46.724
I think I'm gonna
win this thing.

25:46.724 --> 25:48.628
I'm gonna be the first one
up on that balcony.

25:48.628 --> 25:50.632
‐ There's that confidence, man.
‐ All right, Mr. Cocky.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.201
‐ Taste everything, okay?
‐ Absolutely. I'm thinking‐‐

25:52.201 --> 25:53.972
Because you can't change
this taste after the set.

25:53.972 --> 25:55.307
Yes, Chef.

25:55.307 --> 25:56.978
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you very much.

26:00.585 --> 26:01.687
Your honeycomb looks good,
Dino.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.791
Thank you, babies.

26:03.791 --> 26:05.427
‐ Now, Dino.
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:05.427 --> 26:09.102
I've seen you wow me
before with desserts.

26:09.102 --> 26:11.172
Is tonight gonna be
an exception?

26:11.172 --> 26:13.110
I really hope not.
I wanna keep doing that,

26:13.110 --> 26:15.047
'cause I really wanna
live that dream one day

26:15.047 --> 26:16.216
of opening up
that pastry shop.

26:16.216 --> 26:17.653
I wanna‐‐ I actually
have a name for it.

26:17.653 --> 26:18.655
It's called
"The Fat Cannoli,"
but, uh...

26:18.655 --> 26:20.491
‐ "The Fat Cannoli."
‐ Yeah.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.661
Is that from one
of the previous challenges

26:21.661 --> 26:23.030
that you knocked
out of the park?

26:23.030 --> 26:25.167
Yeah. I'm really glad I got
to impress you with that.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.403
I wanna keep going because,
you know,

26:26.403 --> 26:28.574
after meeting you,
that's definitely
one of my dreams.

26:28.574 --> 26:29.977
I love that. Thank you.

26:29.977 --> 26:32.048
I gotta say, the way that
you work in the kitchen,

26:32.048 --> 26:33.518
‐ your ideas,
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:33.518 --> 26:34.853
got high hopes
for you tonight.

26:34.853 --> 26:36.356
Make sure that you taste
that mouth feel

26:36.356 --> 26:38.193
and that you've got nice,
smooth ganache.

26:38.193 --> 26:39.429
And keep your eye
on this honeycomb.

26:39.429 --> 26:41.066
‐ Go get it.
‐ Thank you.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.103
Gordon:
We are halfway, guys.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.407
30 minutes gone,
30 minutes remaining.

26:45.407 --> 26:47.111
I don't know
what the ( bleep )
I'm doing with this.

26:47.111 --> 26:48.548
‐ Jeff, let's go.
‐ Thanks.

26:48.548 --> 26:50.518
Push, push, push, push.
Faster, faster.

26:50.518 --> 26:52.121
Come on, Jeff.
You got this. Pick it up.

26:53.457 --> 26:55.294
Now all of those ganaches

26:55.294 --> 26:57.766
need to go into
the blast chiller,
otherwise it's game over.

26:57.766 --> 27:00.270
They're gonna take
about 10 minutes to cool.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.907
Good job.
Come on. Keep moving.

27:01.907 --> 27:04.412
Ganaches need to be firm,
they need to be hard,

27:04.412 --> 27:05.815
because at the very end
of this challenge,

27:05.815 --> 27:07.218
you need to dip that truffle

27:07.218 --> 27:09.723
to get that beautiful,
perfect outer coating.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.598
Come on, Jeff.
You can do it.
Get those ganaches made.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.535
I can't do this.

27:15.535 --> 27:17.071
Eboni:
<i>Jeff is moving so slow.</i>

27:17.071 --> 27:18.741
It's like he's
so in his own head

27:18.741 --> 27:20.578
that he can't even get right.

27:20.578 --> 27:24.787
<i>Yachecia, Daniel, and Dino</i>
<i>all have their ganache done.</i>

27:24.787 --> 27:27.224
You gotta move, Jeff.
Come on.

27:27.224 --> 27:29.095
<i>If Jeff can't get focused</i>
<i>and get the ganache</i>

27:29.095 --> 27:30.732
<i>and the honeycomb done,</i>
<i>he's going home.</i>

27:30.732 --> 27:32.034
I don't even know
what the ( bleep ) I'm doing.

27:32.034 --> 27:33.538
I got chocolate there,
I got chocolate here.

27:33.538 --> 27:35.040
I can't believe
Jeff giving up.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.213
This is just a disaster.
This is a ( bleep ) disaster.

27:38.213 --> 27:39.315
Jeff is falling apart,
you guys.

27:39.315 --> 27:41.587
‐ Seriously.
‐ Damn it, that's hot.

27:41.587 --> 27:42.388
( bleep )

27:49.503 --> 27:51.740
Gordon:
Less than 20 minutes
remaining.

27:51.740 --> 27:53.611
Panache, precision.

27:53.611 --> 27:56.015
We want a beautiful box
of nine truffles.

27:56.015 --> 27:57.519
One of you is going home.

27:57.519 --> 27:59.288
( bleep ).
Damn it, that's hot.

27:59.288 --> 28:00.825
Come on, Jeff, you can do it.
Get those ganaches made.

28:00.825 --> 28:02.094
I don't even know
what the ( bleep ) I'm doing.

28:02.094 --> 28:03.531
I got chocolate there.
I got chocolate here.

28:03.531 --> 28:05.535
Come on, Jeff.
I know you ain't
quitting on me.

28:05.535 --> 28:06.904
You got this, Jeff.
Come on.

28:06.904 --> 28:10.477
This is just a disaster.
This is a ( bleep ) disaster.

28:10.477 --> 28:11.814
Jeff seems like he's given up.

28:11.814 --> 28:14.085
‐ I can't do this.
‐ You came here to cook.

28:14.085 --> 28:15.454
Don't you got a son
waiting on you?

28:15.454 --> 28:17.759
Focus. You are smart.

28:17.759 --> 28:20.330
You know how to do this.
You can cook.

28:20.330 --> 28:22.301
Jeff:
<i>More than half the time</i>
<i>has gone by.</i>

28:22.301 --> 28:25.742
I have done nothing,
but Eboni's right.

28:25.742 --> 28:27.579
<i>I'm here for my family,</i>

28:27.579 --> 28:30.183
my beautiful fiancée,
my incredible little baby boy.

28:30.183 --> 28:32.254
<i>They believe in me.</i>

28:32.254 --> 28:33.356
Focus. Come on.
You got this.

28:33.356 --> 28:34.860
Okay.

28:34.860 --> 28:36.830
I need to start believing
in myself and get it going,

28:36.830 --> 28:39.435
<i>because I'm not going</i>
<i>back home to Tampa right now.</i>

28:39.435 --> 28:40.538
White chocolate is done.

28:40.538 --> 28:42.676
There you go, Jeff.
Two more ganaches.

28:42.676 --> 28:45.047
Get 'em in that fridge
before the next
ten minutes are up.

28:45.047 --> 28:47.719
20 minutes left to go.
Clean slate, get it done.

28:47.719 --> 28:49.055
Cocoa, gold.
Dark, next.

28:49.055 --> 28:50.792
‐ You're doing good.
‐ Bounce back.

28:50.792 --> 28:52.294
Got your dark chocolate,
got your milk chocolate. Done.

28:52.294 --> 28:53.664
Jason:
Make your family
proud of you.

28:53.664 --> 28:54.866
I know you can do it.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.302
Dark chocolate
and dark chocolate.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.874
That's what I'm
talking about, Jeff. Get it.

28:58.874 --> 29:00.545
It's getting there.
It's getting there.
It's getting there.

29:00.545 --> 29:03.818
Now all of those ganaches should
be out of the blast chiller.

29:03.818 --> 29:06.155
From there, they'll scoop out
even quantities

29:06.155 --> 29:08.527
of each ganache
and roll them very gently

29:08.527 --> 29:09.596
between the palm
of their hands.

29:09.596 --> 29:11.967
Ha ha! Yeah!

29:11.967 --> 29:14.205
‐ Looks good, Yachecia.
‐ There you go, Yachecia.

29:14.205 --> 29:16.042
I'm very impressed
with where Yachecia's at.

29:16.042 --> 29:17.211
Her honeycomb looks beautiful.

29:17.211 --> 29:19.382
She's staying
very organized and calm.

29:19.382 --> 29:23.223
Aarón:
She seems to be really
in charge of these truffles.

29:23.223 --> 29:25.661
Baby doll! All right!

29:25.661 --> 29:28.400
Christina:
Dino, I have to say,
is the other one

29:28.400 --> 29:29.669
who's really impressing me
out there tonight.

29:29.669 --> 29:32.642
He's applying pressure
and rolling those truffles.

29:32.642 --> 29:35.347
He's really working
like a pastry chef
at this stage.

29:37.151 --> 29:40.691
Ten minutes, guys.
Last ten minutes.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.562
( sighs )

29:42.562 --> 29:43.697
Keep going, Jeff.
Keep going.

29:43.697 --> 29:45.267
All right, that's good.

29:45.267 --> 29:46.537
Eboni:
Come on, Jeff.

29:46.537 --> 29:49.709
Let's talk about that
white chocolate ganache.

29:49.709 --> 29:51.880
You need to dip
that truffle twice

29:51.880 --> 29:54.519
to get that beautiful,
perfect outer coating

29:54.519 --> 29:56.523
with just a little sliver
of cherry on top.

29:56.523 --> 29:57.926
Cate:
Looks good, Daniel.
You're almost there.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.261
Eboni:
Looking good.

29:59.261 --> 30:00.397
What are you,
a pastry chef, Daniel?

30:00.397 --> 30:02.101
Ugh!

30:02.101 --> 30:03.704
Aarón:
Nice and delicate, Yachecia.

30:03.704 --> 30:05.875
Make sure they're
completely encased.

30:05.875 --> 30:07.979
Not coming together at all.

30:07.979 --> 30:10.551
That's not good.

30:10.551 --> 30:11.787
Christina:
Now, Jeff is dipping

30:11.787 --> 30:13.256
his white chocolate
cherry truffle,

30:13.256 --> 30:14.425
and it actually looks
quite nice.

30:14.425 --> 30:16.797
Aarón: It looks glazed
and beautiful from here.

30:16.797 --> 30:18.667
Ooh, looking good, Jeff.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.239
Christina:
Two minutes to go, guys.

30:21.239 --> 30:22.407
Aarón:
Get what you got
in the box now.

30:22.407 --> 30:24.513
‐ Come on, guys.
‐ Go, go, go.

30:24.513 --> 30:26.415
Gordon:
Start setting yourself up
for success.

30:26.415 --> 30:28.319
Your chocolate have got
to be set, guys.

30:28.319 --> 30:30.658
Otherwise
you cannot put them
into the box wet.

30:30.658 --> 30:32.595
Oh, Lord!
That is hideous.

30:32.595 --> 30:33.964
Come on, Yachecia.

30:33.964 --> 30:34.799
Get your truffles
in your box.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.269
Ugh!

30:36.269 --> 30:37.004
You ain't came
all the way from Detroit

30:37.004 --> 30:38.339
to go home today,
did you?

30:38.339 --> 30:40.811
‐ 60 seconds.
‐ Aarón: Come on, 60 seconds.

30:40.811 --> 30:42.615
‐ Gabriel: Final stretch!
‐ Christina:
Gold leaf. Cherry.

30:42.615 --> 30:44.819
‐ Gordon: Daniel, hurry up.
‐ Daniel, move, man.

30:44.819 --> 30:46.990
‐ 30 seconds remaining.
‐ Eboni: Come on,
come on, come on.

30:46.990 --> 30:51.032
‐ Jason:
Jeff, get 'em in the box.
‐ Perfect those chocolates.

30:51.032 --> 30:53.002
Get the gold leaf
in the box.

30:53.002 --> 30:54.673
‐ Come on.
‐ Here we go.

30:54.673 --> 30:57.579
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,

30:57.579 --> 31:00.317
seven, six, five,

31:00.317 --> 31:04.158
four, three, two, one.

31:04.158 --> 31:05.695
And stop! Well done.

31:05.695 --> 31:06.964
( cheering )

31:06.964 --> 31:08.266
‐ Great job!
‐ Yes!

31:09.769 --> 31:11.339
‐ Great job!
‐ Gordon: Well done.

31:11.339 --> 31:13.376
Oh, my God.

31:13.376 --> 31:15.313
Christina: All right,
please very gently

31:15.313 --> 31:17.017
bring those truffle boxes
down to the front.

31:17.017 --> 31:18.486
Good job, guys.
That was tough.

31:18.486 --> 31:20.457
Good job, y'all.
That was hard.

31:20.457 --> 31:21.627
Jeff:
<i>This pressure test,</i>

31:21.627 --> 31:23.864
it got to me
right from the beginning.

31:23.864 --> 31:25.668
<i>I wasted 30 minutes,</i>

31:25.668 --> 31:27.872
<i>but somehow, some way,</i>
<i>I got it done.</i>

31:30.578 --> 31:32.147
‐ Jeff.
‐ Mm.

31:32.147 --> 31:35.253
Let's see what this box
of chocolates looks like.

31:39.161 --> 31:42.067
‐ Visually, it's not perfect.
‐ Mm‐mm.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.906
That honeycomb
that's missing from the box

31:44.906 --> 31:49.516
is actually meant to be
enrobed around that
dark chocolate ganache.

31:49.516 --> 31:52.187
Let's take a look at this
dark chocolate truffle.

31:56.028 --> 31:57.865
( exhales )

31:57.865 --> 31:59.536
‐ I'm impressed.
‐ Thank you.

31:59.536 --> 32:02.040
‐ You see that?
‐ Yes.

32:02.040 --> 32:05.046
That's a pretty
impressive ganache.
Look at that.

32:09.154 --> 32:11.092
The center of the ganache,

32:11.092 --> 32:14.498
it's almost impossibly
smooth and luxurious.

32:14.498 --> 32:16.837
I think, for me,
the disappointment
lies in the fact

32:16.837 --> 32:18.774
that it's missing
the honeycomb exterior.

32:18.774 --> 32:20.043
It's a shame.

32:20.043 --> 32:22.347
Next up,
that milk chocolate truffle.

32:25.387 --> 32:27.925
And, again,
you've really nailed
that beautiful,

32:27.925 --> 32:29.696
smooth inner ganache.

32:29.696 --> 32:30.731
Thank you very much.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.610
I think
the quantity of pecans
you used is spot‐on.

32:36.610 --> 32:38.379
I would have loved for them
to be in the center

32:38.379 --> 32:39.716
so that I get them
throughout.

32:39.716 --> 32:41.152
Okay.

32:41.152 --> 32:42.722
And the white chocolate
truffle.

32:42.722 --> 32:44.759
‐ Visually, it's...
‐ The weakest.

32:44.759 --> 32:46.295
‐ the worst‐looking
truffle in the box.
‐ I would agree.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.677
Tell you what,
if it was a challenge

32:53.677 --> 32:56.850
of impossibly smooth,
rich ganaches,

32:56.850 --> 32:58.787
you would have been
a top runner.

32:58.787 --> 33:01.593
But it's a challenge
of a beautiful box
of chocolate truffles,

33:01.593 --> 33:03.129
‐ Yes, it is.
‐ and you failed
in the presentation,

33:03.129 --> 33:05.133
‐ Yes, I did.
‐ and some of the composition,

33:05.133 --> 33:06.736
and I really don't know
if that's enough

33:06.736 --> 33:07.738
to stay in this competition
at this point.

33:07.738 --> 33:08.740
Understandable.

33:18.059 --> 33:20.631
Dino,
how did you feel it went?

33:20.631 --> 33:23.436
It was, uh,
probably the hardest
challenge I've ever done.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.240
Well, let's see what's
in yours, Dino, okay?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.242
Okay.

33:30.851 --> 33:34.191
Look at that. Wow.

33:34.191 --> 33:36.295
You know what, Dino?
This takes training,

33:36.295 --> 33:39.769
year and years
of pastry production
to nail this skill,

33:39.769 --> 33:42.642
and I think visually
you excelled.

33:42.642 --> 33:43.777
Thank you, Chef.

33:45.046 --> 33:46.148
So now I'm gonna look at

33:46.148 --> 33:48.119
the ever‐important ganache.

33:49.889 --> 33:51.492
Oh, man.

33:51.492 --> 33:54.131
I see pure beauty, my man.

33:54.131 --> 33:55.734
Look how smooth that is.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.337
You tempered it perfectly.

33:57.337 --> 33:58.674
That's how it should look.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.155
Oh, delicious.

34:06.155 --> 34:06.957
The honeycomb
is right there.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.092
It's caramelized perfectly.

34:08.092 --> 34:09.829
Very true
to Chef Christina's.

34:09.829 --> 34:10.831
Thank you, Chef.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.051
Mm.

34:21.051 --> 34:22.622
Right on point, flavor‐wise.

34:22.622 --> 34:24.024
Thank you, Chef.

34:24.024 --> 34:25.861
I think it's well‐balanced.

34:25.861 --> 34:27.732
You got the double layer
of the white chocolate there.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.804
The consistency
of the ganaches are unreal.

34:30.804 --> 34:32.207
You kicked some ass.

34:32.207 --> 34:33.677
Thank you, Chef.

34:33.677 --> 34:35.013
‐ Good job, Dino.
‐ Nice job, Dino.

34:35.013 --> 34:36.081
‐ Nice job.
‐ Nice job.

34:36.081 --> 34:37.083
Nice job.

34:40.691 --> 34:43.864
Yachecia.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.534
Okay, so,
tough challenge.

34:45.534 --> 34:46.836
Very tough.

34:46.836 --> 34:50.443
Do you stand behind
what's in your box?

34:50.443 --> 34:53.550
I am proud of two
of the truffles.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.418
Well, that's not good enough.

34:57.357 --> 34:58.627
Oh, no.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.337
No.

35:04.337 --> 35:06.175
No!

35:06.175 --> 35:07.545
Yachecia.

35:09.014 --> 35:10.584
You may as well
untie your apron.

35:20.571 --> 35:23.342
Yachecia.

35:23.342 --> 35:27.518
Do you stand behind
what's in your box?

35:27.518 --> 35:30.456
I am proud
of two of the truffles.

35:30.456 --> 35:31.425
Well, that's not good enough.

35:35.433 --> 35:38.405
Oh, no.

35:38.405 --> 35:41.445
No!

35:41.445 --> 35:42.915
Yachecia.

35:42.915 --> 35:45.086
You may as well
untie your apron.

35:45.086 --> 35:48.325
Looks terrible.
What is that?

35:48.325 --> 35:50.396
What‐‐

35:52.300 --> 35:54.271
‐ Oh.
‐ Did you bite it?

35:54.271 --> 35:55.641
It's horrible.

35:55.641 --> 35:57.110
Mm, mm, mm.

35:57.110 --> 35:59.347
Jeez.

35:59.347 --> 36:02.555
These other two
that you have completed

36:02.555 --> 36:04.625
need to be immaculate,
let me tell you.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.130
Let's start off with
the dark chocolate.

36:12.140 --> 36:14.211
‐ Did you taste these?
‐ I did, Chef.

36:14.211 --> 36:15.547
And what
was the feedback?

36:15.547 --> 36:16.281
I thought it was good.

36:20.958 --> 36:25.233
Your dark chocolate
truffles...

36:25.233 --> 36:26.669
are delicious.

36:26.669 --> 36:28.472
Thank you, Chef.

36:28.472 --> 36:30.611
Smooth ganache,
perfect consistency.

36:30.611 --> 36:33.148
Rich, moreish,
everything you want
from a truffle.

36:33.148 --> 36:34.685
Yachecia:
Thank you, Chef.

36:34.685 --> 36:37.190
Right.
The milk chocolate one.

36:45.139 --> 36:48.212
Uh, Yachecia, delicious.

36:48.212 --> 36:50.216
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ The ganache is smooth,

36:50.216 --> 36:52.053
has the right amount
of bourbon in there.

36:52.053 --> 36:53.823
I mean, it tastes perfect.

36:53.823 --> 36:56.061
Now I've got nowhere to go now.

36:56.061 --> 36:58.365
I've got two
delicious truffles,

36:58.365 --> 37:00.837
but we're judging
the whole box of chocolates.

37:00.837 --> 37:01.873
What a shame.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.526
All right, Daniel.
How did that go?

37:11.526 --> 37:13.797
I'm very happy with what
I was able to accomplish
in those 60 minutes.

37:13.797 --> 37:14.865
Let's take a look.

37:14.865 --> 37:16.602
Let's do it.

37:20.944 --> 37:22.113
Okay.

37:22.113 --> 37:23.683
White chocolate
truffles here,

37:23.683 --> 37:25.286
it's clear
you struggled there.

37:25.286 --> 37:28.292
Yeah, I admittedly
had a little bit of trouble
with the coating.

37:28.292 --> 37:30.296
It was a lot more difficult
than I thought it would be.

37:30.296 --> 37:31.799
‐ Let's see how they taste.
‐ Please.

37:35.540 --> 37:36.676
It's got cherries inside.

37:36.676 --> 37:38.379
Looks like a really
great ratio there.

37:42.420 --> 37:44.725
You know, the flavors
are definitely there,

37:44.725 --> 37:47.898
but it's not unctuous
and smooth.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.835
( sighs )

37:49.835 --> 37:52.841
Okay,
let's take a look at these
dark chocolate truffles.

37:55.446 --> 37:58.252
What is this down here?

37:58.252 --> 38:01.124
I think you have a piece
of chocolate in there.

38:01.124 --> 38:03.228
‐ Can you see that?
‐ I can.

38:03.228 --> 38:06.068
‐ Must not have melted.
‐ That's not good.

38:06.068 --> 38:07.470
Absolutely not.

38:13.683 --> 38:16.388
The bits of the ganache
that are smooth are smooth,

38:16.388 --> 38:18.158
but there's
big chunks in it,

38:18.158 --> 38:19.895
‐ which is a number‐one no‐no
‐ Of course. Of course.

38:19.895 --> 38:22.433
when making
chocolate truffles.
Oh, what a shame.

38:26.676 --> 38:28.546
Daniel:
<i>At this point</i>
<i>in the competition,</i>

38:28.546 --> 38:30.449
<i>it's definitely all about</i>
<i>the minor details</i>

38:30.449 --> 38:32.955
<i>and getting everything as close</i>
<i>to perfect as possible,</i>

38:32.955 --> 38:34.290
and I definitely
didn't do that tonight.

38:34.290 --> 38:37.096
<i>Yachecia was missing</i>
<i>a couple truffles.</i>

38:37.096 --> 38:40.102
<i>Jeff got his coatings</i>
<i>a bit mixed up.</i>

38:40.102 --> 38:42.373
<i>You know, hopefully</i>
<i>Yachecia and Jeff's mistakes</i>

38:42.373 --> 38:44.244
<i>were big enough</i>
<i>that they outweigh mine</i>

38:44.244 --> 38:45.647
and I can move up
to that balcony

38:45.647 --> 38:46.414
and into the top seven.

38:47.885 --> 38:49.989
Now, first, the good news.

38:49.989 --> 38:52.794
One of you
did a fantastic job.

38:52.794 --> 38:55.667
Please step forward...

38:55.667 --> 38:57.971
Dino.

38:57.971 --> 38:59.073
‐ Nice job, Dino.
‐ Good job, buddy.

38:59.073 --> 39:00.075
Nice job.

39:01.579 --> 39:04.117
Dino, you nailed that box
of chocolates tonight.

39:04.117 --> 39:05.887
Please head on up
to the balcony.

39:05.887 --> 39:07.290
‐ Good job.
‐ Well done.

39:07.290 --> 39:08.560
‐ Baby doll, hurry up!
‐ Congratulations. Well done.

39:11.966 --> 39:14.437
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you.

39:14.437 --> 39:17.544
All right, it comes
down to you three.

39:17.544 --> 39:21.719
Jeff, Yachecia, and Daniel‐‐

39:21.719 --> 39:23.723
all three of you up here
for good reason,

39:23.723 --> 39:27.063
and one of you
will be going home.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.741
Step forward, please...

39:33.843 --> 39:36.281
Yachecia.

39:37.684 --> 39:39.420
Please step forward, Jeff.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.305
Jeff and Yachecia...

39:54.852 --> 39:56.321
say goodbye to Daniel.

39:59.662 --> 40:01.532
It's all right.

40:04.672 --> 40:06.542
Head up.

40:13.021 --> 40:16.194
Daniel, unfortunately
that means your time is done

40:16.194 --> 40:18.098
inside of
the MasterChef kitchen.

40:18.098 --> 40:20.537
It's down
to these technical errors,

40:20.537 --> 40:22.006
and the backbone
of any truffle

40:22.006 --> 40:23.509
is the ganache,
unfortunately.

40:23.509 --> 40:26.281
Um, incredible journey,
gallant performance.

40:26.281 --> 40:28.018
How are you feeling?

40:28.018 --> 40:29.855
I didn't plan on going home
any time soon,

40:29.855 --> 40:31.191
but when my baby's born,
I can tell him

40:31.191 --> 40:33.095
that his daddy
fought to the very end.

40:33.095 --> 40:34.397
This is something
I'll never forget,

40:34.397 --> 40:36.134
and this is something
that will light the path

40:36.134 --> 40:37.136
for the rest of my life.

40:37.136 --> 40:38.906
Absolutely.

40:38.906 --> 40:40.309
Come and say goodbye, buddy.

40:41.378 --> 40:43.382
Man. Ay‐yi‐yi.

40:43.382 --> 40:44.651
‐ Thanks for everything.
‐ Take care, bud.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.989
‐ You did great, huh?
‐ Thank you.

40:46.989 --> 40:48.258
You guys made
my journey incredible.

40:48.258 --> 40:49.828
The positivity‐‐
the positivity in you.

40:49.828 --> 40:51.297
I'm going home proud, guys.

40:51.297 --> 40:52.466
‐ Thank you, Daniel.
‐ Love you guys.

40:52.466 --> 40:53.903
‐ Good job, Daniel.
‐ Nice job, Daniel.

40:53.903 --> 40:55.774
‐ Win this for me, Dino.
‐ Love you! You're amazing!

40:55.774 --> 40:59.581
I guess I'm supposed
to be upset or disappointed,
but I'm not.

40:59.581 --> 41:01.685
<i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>with what I've done,</i>

41:01.685 --> 41:04.257
<i>what I've accomplished,</i>
<i>and, uh, I get to go home.</i>

41:04.257 --> 41:06.629
I get to hold my fiancée,
I get to feel my baby kick.

41:06.629 --> 41:08.699
Thank you very much, Chefs.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.537
<i>I'm going home too soon,</i>

41:10.537 --> 41:12.607
<i>but I'm going home happy</i>
<i>and with my head high.</i>

41:12.607 --> 41:15.145
‐ I'm coming
to the baby shower!
‐ See you in Boston!

41:15.145 --> 41:16.916
<i>I might be 5'5",</i>

41:16.916 --> 41:18.118
but I feel like
I'm eight feet tall right now.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.495
‐ Announcer: <i>Next week...</i>
‐ It's chopsticks!

41:23.495 --> 41:26.167
<i>...it's a mystery box</i>
<i>from across the globe.</i>

41:26.167 --> 41:27.169
Whoo!

41:27.169 --> 41:28.639
Your MasterChef dreams

41:28.639 --> 41:29.608
are truly
on the line tonight.

41:29.608 --> 41:31.010
<i>And then...</i>

41:31.010 --> 41:33.649
‐ Oh, my goodness. Pasta.
‐ Ow!

41:33.649 --> 41:35.252
‐ <i>The home cooks...</i>
‐ Come on.

41:35.252 --> 41:36.789
<i>face their toughest</i>
<i>challenge yet...</i>

41:36.789 --> 41:38.793
Yachecia:
<i>Lord, I'm gonna need</i>
<i>all the help I can get.</i>

41:38.793 --> 41:40.028
<i>Pasta's the star of the dish,</i>

41:40.028 --> 41:41.632
so if it's not perfect,
I'm done.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.636
The dish is a mess,
and I'm pissed.

41:43.636 --> 41:45.773
<i>leading to an elimination...</i>

41:45.773 --> 41:48.178
This is one
of the toughest decisions
we've ever had to make.

41:48.178 --> 41:50.517
<i>...that shakes up</i>
<i>the competition.</i>

41:50.517 --> 41:51.785
( sobs )
