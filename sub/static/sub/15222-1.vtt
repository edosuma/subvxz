<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.415 --> 00:17.940
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:40.867
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:43.875
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.943 --> 00:47.037

that his next leap...</i>

00:47.113 --> 00:49.104

04:51.057 --> 04:54.185
I answered you in Russian.

04:54.260 --> 04:59.323
You spoke to me in Russian
and- and I answered you.

05:03.102 --> 05:07.266
It's not a game, Marina.

05:13.546 --> 05:17.812
Marina, am I speaking
English or Russian?

05:17.884 --> 05:21.615
I mean, right now
I'm speaking English, right?

05:21.688 --> 05:26.216
But now-

05:37.270 --> 05:39.261
I'm sorry.

05:45.912 --> 05:49.177
You talk Russian.
You talk English.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.342
So do you.
No.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.750
Yes, you do.
You're speaking English right now.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.346
One, two words.
That's three.

05:57.423 --> 06:02.918
And "You talk English. You talk
Russian. " That's four more, seven.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.623
And "no" is eight.
You funny, Alik.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.189
"You funny"-
eight, nine, ten.

06:08.267 --> 06:11.065
How many more words
do you know?

06:11.137 --> 06:14.072
No, in English.
Yes,

06:14.140 --> 06:16.131
no, hello, good-bye,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.701
capitalists exploit the working class.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.644
Where did you learn that?
You.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.579
Me?

06:25.218 --> 06:28.153
<i>Oh, of course, me.</i>

06:30.456 --> 06:33.948
I guess your English is a lot
better than my Russian.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.341
I am not a child!
Don't speak to me like I am!

06:56.048 --> 06:59.745
I'm sorry, Marina.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.946
I don't know why I did that.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.903
Oh, my God.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.500
What's happened to me?

07:25.578 --> 07:27.842
<i>Who have I leaped into?</i>

08:14.627 --> 08:19.621
Funny thing about bullets, huh?
You can't call them back.

08:26.439 --> 08:31.001
<i>You don't want to call that
one back. It's a V-bull.</i>

08:34.212 --> 08:36.408
Looks like you're
gonna qualify expert.

08:36.482 --> 08:40.441
Who would have believed it
of an air wing grunt.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.510
Here.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.426
You gonna make love to it
or load it?

08:54.767 --> 08:58.134
<i>Wow.
Wow?</i>

08:58.204 --> 09:01.071
- If I caught my thumb in it, that would have really hurt.
- Just shoot.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.984
- Now what's the problem?
- How far is that?

09:12.051 --> 09:14.281
- How far is that?
- Yeah.

09:14.353 --> 09:18.255
You know damn well how far it is.
It's 500 yards.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.623
Are you messin' with me, Private?

09:21.694 --> 09:23.628
No, sir.

09:23.696 --> 09:27.564
And don't call me "sir"!
I ain't no frigging officer.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.731
Now... shoot.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.132
Hey, man, I love you too.

09:39.912 --> 09:45.646
Hey, Gunny West told me
you were a loudmouthed ass.

09:46.652 --> 09:50.918
<i>But I never thought anyone would
be dumb enough to mess with me.</i>

09:50.990 --> 09:53.356
I'm sorry-

09:53.426 --> 09:55.587
I'm sorry, Sergeant, I-

09:58.831 --> 10:03.325
Russian? You speaking
to me in Russian?

10:03.402 --> 10:05.336
It's just a little slip of the tongue.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.862
See I'm, uh, I'm studying Russian
and-and-and some-sometimes it comes out.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.909
You know what
I'm studying? Huh?

10:12.979 --> 10:14.913
The Three Stooges?

10:14.981 --> 10:18.007
You have one more round.
Shoot!

10:20.786 --> 10:23.016
I was a pretty good shot on the farm.

10:23.089 --> 10:28.083
Bagged my share of squirrels
with a. 22 and deer with a. 30-06.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.618
But that was long ago
and not at 500 yards.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.359
<i>Did you take a deep breath?</i>

10:34.433 --> 10:36.492
<i>What are you trying to do, kill me?</i>

10:36.569 --> 10:38.537
Now what?

10:38.604 --> 10:40.595
You startled me!
What are you doing?

10:40.673 --> 10:46.043
<i>- I thought you heard the chamber door open and knew I was here.
- You blaming me for jerking one off?</i>

10:46.112 --> 10:49.878
No, not you. I don't see
nobody else standing here.

10:49.949 --> 10:52.179
Yeah well, he does.

10:54.453 --> 10:59.914
<i>- Maggie's drawers.
- Maggie's drawers, that's a euphemism for that rag they're waving there.</i>

10:59.992 --> 11:02.256
<i>It means you missed the target.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.523
218. That's too bad.

11:04.597 --> 11:09.227
If you hadn't jerked off that last round,
you would have made expert.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.326
Sharpshooter is not bad, Sam.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.496
Sign at the bottom, Oswald.
Oswald?

11:15.574 --> 11:18.475
That's your name, ain't it?

11:18.544 --> 11:22.173
He's right, Sam. You've
leaped into Lee Harvey Oswald.

11:22.248 --> 11:26.241
Just a word of advice,
Private.

11:26.318 --> 11:31.517
You wanna ship home with all the body
parts you came here with... zip your lip.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.919
Aye, aye, Sergeant Beaner.

11:43.602 --> 11:45.797
See you on liberty, Oswald.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.072
<i>Sam, are you out of your mind?</i>

11:55.147 --> 12:00.551
You can't talk to anybody like that,
much less a marine sergeant.

12:00.619 --> 12:04.350
<i>I know, Al. I know.
Cease fire.! Cease fire.!</i>

12:04.423 --> 12:06.618
Then why'd you do it?
I didn't.

12:06.692 --> 12:11.959
Excuse me. I heard you! You heard the words
came out of my mouth, but I didn't say 'em.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.625
You're scaring me, Sam.
Well, you're not alone.

12:16.001 --> 12:21.906
Maybe- Maybe this has something to do
with leaping twice into the same person.

12:21.974 --> 12:26.638
- What twice?
- I leaped into Oswald in '63.

12:26.712 --> 12:31.911
At least that's what the newspapers I
was holding said it was, March of'63.

12:31.984 --> 12:35.613
Well, how'd you know you were Oswald?
Marina was taking my picture.

12:35.688 --> 12:39.146
You know that famous picture with the rifle and the
- and the newspapers.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.159
That photograph is a fake.

12:41.227 --> 12:45.493
Yeah. Oswald's face is superimposed
on somebody else's body to frame him.

12:45.564 --> 12:49.933
But Marina took it.
How do you know she was Marina?

12:50.002 --> 12:55.338
I called her Marina and-
and she called me... Alik.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.898
Well, there you see?
You weren't Oswald.

12:57.977 --> 13:02.107
All we have to do is ask Ziggy
to trace the name Alik to anyone...

13:02.181 --> 13:04.672
working at the C.I.A. Or the F.B. -

13:04.750 --> 13:09.153
What? Alik was the name
Oswald used in Russia.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.781
And, uh, that's the name Marina
used to call him.

13:11.857 --> 13:17.193
But that doesn't mean she's the one that took the
picture, and it doesn't mean that you were Oswald.

13:17.263 --> 13:20.596
I was Oswald.
How can you be so sure?

13:20.666 --> 13:24.500
I can feel him in me.
In you?

13:24.570 --> 13:27.937
You know how there's
always a little residual...

13:28.007 --> 13:31.135
of the other person
left behind in a leap?

13:31.210 --> 13:34.202
You know, like a little of their
knowledge or their personality...

13:34.280 --> 13:36.441
or maybe even a little bit
of their soul?

13:36.515 --> 13:39.541
Oswald didn't leave
a little anything in you, Sam.

13:39.618 --> 13:43.145
When you leap into someone,
you're still Dr. Sam Beckett,

13:43.222 --> 13:48.285
with your personality,
your knowledge and you-

13:50.496 --> 13:53.260
Where'd you learn
to fieldstrip an M-1?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.870
I didn't.

14:14.153 --> 14:17.179
<i>I'm him, Al.
I'm Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

14:17.256 --> 14:19.952
No, you're not him!

14:20.025 --> 14:22.220
Then how do you
explain this, hmm?

14:22.294 --> 14:25.730
All right. So you can
fieldstrip an M-1. Big deal.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.767
Thousands of kids learn to
do that in boot camp. Yeah?

14:28.834 --> 14:31.826
Yeah.
Well, I didn't go to boot camp.

14:33.038 --> 14:38.340
All right. So you got a little Lee
Harvey Oswald in you. You can handle that.

14:39.345 --> 14:44.009
What if I got a lot of Lee Harvey Oswald
in me? Huh? I mean think about that.

14:44.083 --> 14:49.043
Do you remember the leap when lightning
struck us and we switched places?

14:49.121 --> 14:51.214
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.384
And I got some
of your libido, right?

14:54.460 --> 14:56.587
Yeah. And you still
behaved like a prude.

14:56.662 --> 15:00.996
What else was I supposed to do? I was
a hologram. Well, it never stopped me.

15:01.066 --> 15:06.663
If you could handle my sex drive, you can certainly
handle a few of Lee Harvey Oswald's loose neurons.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.731
Well, what if I can't handle it?
Huh? I mean, what-

15:11.677 --> 15:16.239
what if I assassinate the president? You're not
gonna assassinate the president. This is '57.

15:16.315 --> 15:20.308
That doesn't happen for another six years.
Fifteen minutes ago it was six years from now.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.650
And who's to say that's
not gonna happen again...

15:22.721 --> 15:26.623
in November with me at
the Texas School Book Depository?

15:28.260 --> 15:30.660
Good God, Al.

15:30.729 --> 15:34.187
If that happened,
I could stop the assassination.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.360
If Oswald really was the assassin.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.666
What do you mean if Oswald
was really the assassin?

15:39.738 --> 15:43.196
Well, there's a lot of people
think that he was set up. Set up?

15:44.843 --> 15:47.778
By whom?
Could have been anybody.

15:47.846 --> 15:50.246
Could've been the F.B.I.,
Secret Service, uh, C.I.A.,

15:50.316 --> 15:53.877
the military, the Mafia,
defense contractors, John Birchers.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.649
You name it. They all had something
to gain from Kennedy's death.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.657
Al, we're talking about murdering
the president of the United States.

15:59.725 --> 16:03.718
Don't you remember all the
conspiracy books and the movies?

16:05.431 --> 16:10.232
No. But I do remember that day
in November like it was yesterday.

16:11.837 --> 16:16.774
I was 10, and my dad was teaching me how to
drive the tractor in the field behind the house.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.037
All of a sudden,
Mom came out yelling at us.

16:19.111 --> 16:23.514
She ran up right to the fence and she was yelling
and we thought it was because what we were doing.

16:23.582 --> 16:27.109
But then she told us that
the president had just been shot.

16:28.320 --> 16:33.417
Al, if I leaped into Oswald to uncover
a conspiracy, why didn't I stay in '63?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.653
Maybe because
it started here at Atsugi.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.423
Atsugi?
Japan.

16:39.298 --> 16:44.326
This doesn't look likeJapan. Sam, military
bases look the same the world over.

16:44.403 --> 16:47.338
But you go out that gate,
and you'll see it's Japan.

16:47.406 --> 16:51.001
There's no doubt about it.
It's very beautiful. It's serene.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.705
And there's a lot
of beautiful geishas.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.714
Okay, Al.

16:56.782 --> 17:01.378
Chip and I, uh, libertied once at a
place called The Inn of the Black Pearl.

17:01.453 --> 17:06.550
Uh-huh. And we would soak in these
wood hot tubs with four naked-

17:06.625 --> 17:09.526
You were saying that Atsugi
is where the conspiracy started?

17:09.595 --> 17:15.192
Uh, yeah. Well, the K.G.B. Probably
contacted Oswald somewhere around here.

17:15.267 --> 17:19.260
Wait. You didn't mention the Russians. They
were behind the assassination? That's one theory.

17:19.338 --> 17:23.900
Another one is that Oswald was just pretending to be with
the K.G.B. He was really with the C.I.A. Or the F.B.I.

17:23.976 --> 17:27.935
Wait. Wait. Wait. Why was the
K.G.B. Even interested in Oswald?

17:28.012 --> 17:32.541
Are you kidding? Oswald was
a radar operator with Macs-1.

17:32.618 --> 17:37.817
He knew all the frequencies, all
the codes, the intercept procedures.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.858
He knew about Race Car.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.326
Race Car, this is Coffee Mill.
Squawk Two. Over.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.924
Uh-oh.
See? See what I'm saying?

17:49.001 --> 17:51.094
That wasn't me, Al.
That was Oswald.

17:51.170 --> 17:54.731
D- D-Don't worry about it. I don't even-Where
did that come from? That was Oswald.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.173
Don't worry it.
H- H-How did I know that?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.733
You can handle it.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.246
To tell you the truth,
I'm not worried about it.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.339
It's just that I don't know
who's controlling who.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.748
I mean, am I controlling Oswald
or is he controlling me?

18:06.819 --> 18:09.185
Sam, listen to me. Wait a
second. That's the scary part.

18:09.254 --> 18:13.953
We're going to uncover this conspiracy
and change what happened in Dallas.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.017
I feel it in my bones.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.599
All you have to do
- All you have to do is hang in there.

18:26.872 --> 18:31.673
<i>I prayed Al was right.
At least part of me did.</i>

18:47.559 --> 18:50.756
<i>Hidell, Alex James.</i>

18:50.829 --> 18:52.990
Private first class.

18:53.065 --> 18:57.468
Serial number: 1522597.

18:58.637 --> 19:03.631
- Hidell? You're saying your name is Hidell?
- What are you, hard of hearing?

19:06.245 --> 19:09.339
What's that?

19:11.750 --> 19:14.651
Uh, it's a tape recorder.
New model.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.654
<i>You won't need it.
I've already told you...</i>

19:16.722 --> 19:22.058
everything I'm obliged to tell you under the rules of the
Geneva Convention. Well, you're obliged to tell the truth.

19:22.127 --> 19:27.565
1653230. That's your real serial
number isn't it, Private Oswald?

19:30.569 --> 19:34.198
That's no tape recorder.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.935
So we both lied.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.034
Who's Alex Hidell?

19:39.111 --> 19:43.844
Oswald, Lee Harvey. Private first class.

19:43.916 --> 19:48.546
Serial number: 1653230.
You're not a prisoner of war.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.886
All members of the proletariat
are prisoners in the class struggle.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.791
I thought you were a member
of the Marine Corps.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.853
My status as a marine
does not alter my membership...

19:58.931 --> 20:02.332
in the exploited and oppressed class
into which I was born.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.369
- I was joking.
- I was not!

20:04.436 --> 20:08.372
Take it easy, kid.
I'm on your side.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.739
- Then I'm free to leave?
- Uh, no. Not exactly.

20:11.810 --> 20:16.770
Then I'm a prisoner. Okay. All right.
You're a prisoner of the proletariat and-

20:16.848 --> 20:20.614
I'm a prisoner of the bourgeois
and a member of the proletariat.

20:20.686 --> 20:23.154
You don't know your Marx,
do you?

20:23.222 --> 20:27.215
After six years in the Hanoi Hilton,
I tend to repress it.

20:27.292 --> 20:30.420
- Where?
- That's where I was held as a prisoner of war...

20:30.495 --> 20:33.225
and where they didn't give a damn
about the Geneva Convention.

20:33.298 --> 20:38.395
<i>Now were you ever approached
by a foreign agent in Japan?</i>

20:38.470 --> 20:41.997
<i>That depends.</i>

20:43.542 --> 20:45.635
Hmm. Are you
a foreign agent, Al?

20:47.679 --> 20:51.410
That's your name, isn't it? Al.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.576
How- How did I know your name?

20:53.652 --> 20:59.522
You're part of an experiment
- a new way of communicating through the mesons and neurons of the mind.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.788
You messed with my mind?

21:02.861 --> 21:05.295
What else have you messed with?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.170
<i>This is Race Car, over.</i>

21:18.377 --> 21:22.507
<i>Race car, this is Coffee Mill.
Read you five-by-five. Over.</i>

21:22.581 --> 21:24.515
<i>Coffee Mill, Race Car.</i>

21:24.583 --> 21:29.850
<i>Starting my descent for home and having a little
trouble with my TACAN. Can you give me a steer? Over.</i>

21:29.921 --> 21:33.220
<i>Yeah. Race car,
squawk two and ident.</i>

21:33.292 --> 21:36.523
<i>Race car squawking two
and identifying.</i>

21:36.595 --> 21:40.861
Yeah, Race Car, this is Coffee Mill.
I have you a 180 nautical miles out.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.298
I have you bearing
2- niner-0 relative.

21:43.368 --> 21:46.531
<i>Over.
Roger that.</i>

21:46.605 --> 21:50.200
<i>It was eerie. I was doing Oswald's job
as if I'd been trained for it,</i>

21:50.275 --> 21:56.009
<i>even beginning to enjoy myself, until I realized
that I was bound to slip up sooner or later.</i>

21:56.081 --> 21:59.812
I can't find his altitude. Uh,
Race Car, say your angels. Over.

22:00.886 --> 22:05.880
<i>This is Race Car. I am, uh, somewhere
above angels 20 and descending.</i>

22:05.957 --> 22:08.391
<i>Somewhere above?
He's gotta be way above.</i>

22:08.460 --> 22:12.487
<i>I'm reading everything from angels
4-5 and I still don't have him.</i>

22:12.564 --> 22:16.660
<i>- We don't need Race Car's altitude to give him a steer, Briggs.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

22:17.736 --> 22:23.003
<i>Attention unidentified aircraft. You are
entering a restricted zone. Do you copy? Over.</i>

22:25.610 --> 22:27.544
<i>- What's he doing?
- Uh, Ozzie Rabbit.</i>

22:27.612 --> 22:29.546
<i>Um, right here. Yeah.</i>

22:29.614 --> 22:34.779
You're-You're supposed to write that
so that we can read it too, Bugs. Okay?

22:34.853 --> 22:38.118
<i>This is no time for games, Oswald.</i>

22:38.190 --> 22:41.626
<i>Backwards. Sam, you've got to
write everything backwards.</i>

22:41.693 --> 22:45.026
<i>He's weird.</i>

22:46.765 --> 22:51.532
<i>What's so damn funny?</i>

22:51.603 --> 22:54.697
<i>- Sam.!
- What's the problem, Oswald?</i>

22:56.842 --> 22:59.037
Hey.
Nothing.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.205
<i>Sir.! Nothing, sir.!</i>

23:02.280 --> 23:04.305
Geez.
Sorry, sir.

23:10.589 --> 23:14.320
Al, you got to get me
out of here fast.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.055
<i>I can't control Oswald's
emotions anymore.</i>

23:17.129 --> 23:21.361
<i>I can see that. If it'll make you feel any
better, he's taking on a little bit of you.</i>

23:21.433 --> 23:24.061
<i>Well, it does not make me
feel better at all! Calm down.!</i>

23:24.136 --> 23:25.933
Oswald, is your mike out?

23:28.707 --> 23:32.074
No. No, it's fine, sir.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.681
Better let me do the talking.
I always do.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.741
Oh, I got him! He just popped up on
my scope descending through angels 4-5.

23:40.819 --> 23:46.416
<i>Uh, Race Car, this is Coffee Mill. Turn right
to a heading of 0- 6-5 and squawk one, over.</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:49.483
<i>Race Car. 0-6-5.
Squawking one, over.</i>

23:49.561 --> 23:54.931
Uh, Lieutenant, uh, based on Race Car's
rate of descent since his initial call,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.730
he had to have been up
around angels 9-0.

23:57.803 --> 24:00.601
<i>That's almost 30,000 feet
above the world record.</i>

24:00.672 --> 24:02.765
You miscalculated, Briggs.

24:02.841 --> 24:07.369
I don't think so, sir. I figured out his rate of
descent and I- and I clocked him from his first-

24:07.446 --> 24:09.471
<i>You miscalculated, Briggs.</i>

24:12.484 --> 24:14.543
- Yes, sir.
- Listen up, people.

24:14.619 --> 24:18.646
We're not here to calculate how high,
how fast or how far Race Car can fly.

24:18.723 --> 24:24.628
<i>All that is top secret and not to be discussed,
even among yourselves. Do you read me?</i>

24:24.696 --> 24:27.460
Five-by-five, sir.

24:29.067 --> 24:32.400
<i>Al. Flagcheck Leader, stand
by to hand off to Toby O'Niel.</i>

24:32.471 --> 24:34.666
Race Car's a U-2, isn't it?

24:34.739 --> 24:37.435
You heard the lieutenant.
We're not supposed to discuss that.

24:37.509 --> 24:42.071
What am I going to do, tell the Russians?
Well, that's what we're here to find out.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.547
Ziggy says if the K.G.B.
Makes contact...

24:44.616 --> 24:49.212
it's gonna be in Yamato at a bar where
Oswald hangs out called Negashaia.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.221
Negashaia.
And-

24:51.289 --> 24:53.348
What?
Uh, interesting.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.376
Lee-san!

25:21.453 --> 25:23.614
Where you been?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.952
Your mama-san missed you.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.460
Cried many tears on my pillow.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.416
I really missed you, Lee-san.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.595
I really missed you too.

26:04.663 --> 26:08.656
<i>You ichiban liar man.</i>

26:08.733 --> 26:12.225
But I love it.
Why you stay away from Negashaia?

26:12.304 --> 26:16.035
Uh, you know, uh, duty and-

26:16.107 --> 26:20.635
Pillow talk says Macs-1 's marines
up to something hush-hush.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.943
Pillow talk?
Sex.

26:26.351 --> 26:29.946
They also say Macs-1 's marines
go to sea soon.

26:30.021 --> 26:33.320
Maybe, uh, Philippines
or maybe Indonesia.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.325
Is this true?

26:35.393 --> 26:37.520
Why would you want to know?

26:37.596 --> 26:41.327
Oh. Macs-1 's marines
are my friends-o.

26:41.399 --> 26:45.699
You leave Atsugi,
many broken hearts-o.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.967
I have to send my girls
back to the farms.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.838
So you're only interested
in the welfare of your girls?

26:51.910 --> 26:54.003
Why else?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.482
You think poorJoda is a spy?
Are you?

26:59.551 --> 27:01.849
Well,

27:04.889 --> 27:07.881
I do almost anything for money.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.261
<i>Even with a little
Lee Harvey Oswald in me,</i>

27:19.337 --> 27:22.932
<i>I... wasn't prepared for this.</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:26.702
<i>Not prepared at all.</i>

27:33.652 --> 27:38.749
Hey, honey, you buy me drink.
I show you a good time.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.452
<i>I ichiban mama-san.
No. No, thanks.</i>

27:42.527 --> 27:45.052
I know special tricks, no?

27:49.601 --> 27:52.661
Hey!

27:57.242 --> 27:59.233
It's all right.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.712
<i>Look out. Cat fight. Cat fight.</i>

28:08.787 --> 28:11.187
Why did you
let her touch you?

28:11.256 --> 28:13.417
Mariska, it's my fault.

28:13.491 --> 28:17.325
I was going to scratch her eyes out,
but I just did my nails.

28:31.676 --> 28:33.769
Hey! Come on!
Let 'em fight, Bugs!

28:33.845 --> 28:35.813
<i>Get out of there,
Ozzie Rabbit.!</i>

28:35.880 --> 28:39.941
You stay away from my guy!
You stay! Go away! Out!

28:43.488 --> 28:45.422
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:45.490 --> 28:49.756
Hey, let a marine who appreciates
a woman buy you a drink, huh?

28:49.828 --> 28:52.456
Yeah!

28:55.100 --> 28:58.433
You promise no more trouble?
No trouble.

28:58.503 --> 29:02.837
<i>I got me ichiban marine.</i>

29:02.907 --> 29:05.171
Come on, come on.
Sit, sit.

29:11.716 --> 29:14.981
I'm sorry about that.
I don't believe you.

29:18.990 --> 29:22.983
As my Uncle Duchin says-

29:30.568 --> 29:33.401
I used to, uh,
speak some Russian.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.872
But I don't seem to remember
very much right now.

29:38.309 --> 29:42.177
All you have to remember is-

29:42.247 --> 29:45.512
I love you.
I love you too, Lee.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.522
How do you say "Oh, boy"
in Russian?

30:06.437 --> 30:08.405
Talk some more Russian to me.

30:08.473 --> 30:13.001
Sometimes I think Russian
is the only reason you come to see me.

30:13.077 --> 30:16.535
That can't be true.
I think so.

30:16.614 --> 30:20.141
There's plenty of other girls here
who make love to you.

30:24.756 --> 30:28.214
But only Mariska can
make love to you in Russian-

30:28.293 --> 30:31.922
tell you stories in Russian.

30:31.996 --> 30:36.092
You do tell wonderful stories.
Uncle Duchin taught me.

30:36.167 --> 30:40.467
He's the best storyteller in all of Minsk.
Wait till you meet him.

30:40.538 --> 30:44.941
He'll fill your stomach with vodka
and your head with tales of his youth.

30:46.177 --> 30:50.238
I can't wait. When?
When we go to Russia.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.883
If you still want to go to Russia.

30:59.257 --> 31:02.021
I've always wanted to go to Russia.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.262
It's the worker's paradise.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.061
As long as you aren't half oriental.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.431
Do you think
it's better in America?

31:12.503 --> 31:14.494
Lee.

31:17.242 --> 31:20.109
I know that you were
unhappy in America,

31:20.178 --> 31:22.612
but it would be different
there with me.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.946
L- I could make you
very happy.

31:27.018 --> 31:31.614
My mother slaved for the capitalists her
whole life and all she got was nothing.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.680
<i>Nothing!</i>

31:34.792 --> 31:39.491
You are the only marine who says America is a
bad place. What other marines do you talk to?

31:39.564 --> 31:43.159
Just the ones who buy me drink.
What else do they buy?

31:43.234 --> 31:45.395
Huh?
Nothing!

31:45.470 --> 31:47.495
Huh?
Nothing! Just drink.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.563
Lee, it's my job.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.971
You're my only boyfriend.

32:02.153 --> 32:05.987
Sam, you'll never
believe wh-what-

32:06.057 --> 32:09.686
Looks like my libido
finally kicked in. Sam?

32:11.496 --> 32:14.693
Please, Lee, I won't talk
about going to America again.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.757
I believe you.
We go to Russia.

32:16.834 --> 32:18.768
We go to Siberia.
I believe you.

32:18.836 --> 32:20.997
<i>Anyplace you want.
What's goin'on, Sam?</i>

32:21.072 --> 32:25.065
Right now, you just have to excuse
me. L-I need to go to the bathroom.

32:36.354 --> 32:39.482
Kenji!

33:03.681 --> 33:06.616
<i>Sam, what's going on?</i>

33:06.684 --> 33:10.313
I'm losing it, Al. That's what's
going on. Yeah, I already did.

33:10.388 --> 33:14.222
<i>I spent half of my first tour
like that. I can't control him.</i>

33:14.292 --> 33:18.422
<i>Hey, don't worry. He's
- He's too drunk to give you any problem. Not him.</i>

33:18.496 --> 33:21.465
Huh?
Oswald.

33:21.532 --> 33:25.935
He's- He's taking over my mind.

33:26.004 --> 33:29.303
Well, that's impossible.
He- He can't take over your mind.

33:29.374 --> 33:33.572
I'm reacting like him. I'm-I'm talking
like him. I'm thinking like him.

33:33.644 --> 33:38.172
I don't know where
he stops and I start, Al.

33:40.151 --> 33:43.279
And how I treated Mariska out
there was sickening. What'd you do?

33:43.354 --> 33:47.256
- I treated her like dirt, and she threw herself at me.
- Oh! Works every time.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.859
Hey, well, no, I mean, it-it
shouldn't work. It shouldn't work.

33:51.929 --> 33:56.093
And-And any man would be ashamed of treating
a woman like that. Her name's Mariska?

33:56.167 --> 33:58.135
She's part Russian, I think.

33:58.202 --> 34:02.571
Oh. Hey, she could be the
K.G.B. Agent. I don't think so.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.804
She's just
- She's teaching Oswald Russian, you know,

34:06.878 --> 34:09.108
and-and sleeping with him.

34:09.179 --> 34:13.241
Oh, you're sleeping with her? No, I'm not
sleeping with her. Oswald is sleeping with her.

34:13.317 --> 34:16.616
Well, what's the difference? I just met
her, okay? I'm not sleeping with her.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.780
I don't know her.
I just met her, okay?

34:18.856 --> 34:22.724
Don't get so touchy. I want to make sure you're
prepared in case you have to sleep with her.

34:22.793 --> 34:26.252
I'm not like you. I don't have to sleep
with every woman that I meet just because-

34:26.330 --> 34:29.163
because she's there. But you may
have to sleep with her to prove...

34:29.233 --> 34:32.100
- or disprove whether or not she's an agent.
- What?

34:32.170 --> 34:36.231
Look, female spies have been doing this
since Mata Hari to find out military secrets.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.831
They sleep with
- Yeah, except I don't know any military secrets.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.676
Well, you don't know what you don't
know. Al, if you were in the K.G.B.,

34:42.746 --> 34:44.737
would you hire anyone...

34:44.815 --> 34:49.650
- as conspicuous as Mariska to be your agent.
- Maybe that's what they're counting on.

34:49.719 --> 34:54.453
That our guys would think she's such an obvious
choice that they wouldn't pick her and then they do.

34:54.525 --> 34:59.462
Mariska is no agent, Al. Oswald is just
interested in anything or anyone Russian.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.760
- How do you know?
- How do I-

35:01.833 --> 35:05.462
Because I've been spouting his words
like a trained parrot, okay?

35:05.536 --> 35:08.198
I've been doing his job.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.638
I mean, I know him better
than his own mother does.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.939
I even know what motivates him.
Look at this.

35:14.011 --> 35:19.142
<i>- Oh, that's The Communist Manifesto. - Yeah. Yeah.
I found this in my locker- in Oswald's locker. Right?</i>

35:19.217 --> 35:21.777
It's dog-eared.
It's-It's underlined. See that?

35:21.853 --> 35:24.014
I mean, this is his religion.
This is his Bible.

35:24.088 --> 35:28.923
His- His mecca is Moscow
and his Muhammad is Marx.

35:28.993 --> 35:32.952
<i>I don't ever want to be that cold again.</i>

35:33.030 --> 35:35.794
A piece of shrapnel tore-

35:38.102 --> 35:41.037
Well, well.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.244
What's a bait fish like you...

35:48.312 --> 35:50.371
doing in a shark's bar?

35:52.617 --> 35:54.710
Huh?

36:00.791 --> 36:02.759
You guys know who this is?

36:02.827 --> 36:08.390
This marine is more famous
than Chesty Puller.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.734
This is Private First Class
Lee Harvey Oswald.

36:13.804 --> 36:18.264
Otherwise known as Ozzie Rabbit.

36:18.342 --> 36:21.971
<i>- Sam, you'd better
get out ofhere right now.</i>

36:22.046 --> 36:27.541
Sarge, I don't want any trouble. So, uh,
you guys go ahead and have a good time.

36:27.618 --> 36:30.610
No, not so quick, Bugs.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.218
Would you deprive
Sergeants Wojowski and Miller...

36:37.295 --> 36:40.890
of the honor of shaking
the hand of the man...

36:40.965 --> 36:44.059
<i>Whose bravery
in the face of the enemy...</i>

36:44.135 --> 36:49.232
is sung about from
the halls of Negashaia-

36:49.307 --> 36:54.267
#To the shores of Atsugi #

36:54.345 --> 36:56.643
The enemy?
Sam-

36:56.714 --> 36:59.842
That's right, Bugs.

36:59.917 --> 37:04.650
<i>Me. Uh, Sam, Ziggy's, uh, spitting
out all kinds of new data here.</i>

37:04.722 --> 37:08.624
<i>Maybe we missed something, or,
uh, maybe you're changing history.</i>

37:08.693 --> 37:11.161
Is this why I'm here?
Yeah.

37:11.229 --> 37:15.996
So I can teach you a lesson.

37:26.077 --> 37:30.776
The only thing you can teach me is how
to play drop the soap in the shower.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.180
<i>Sam.! What do you-
You wanna get killed?</i>

37:33.251 --> 37:36.414
<i>Ziggy's predicting that this Lopez
will knock the hell out of Oswald.!</i>

37:40.091 --> 37:42.389
I'm not Oswald.

37:42.460 --> 37:46.453
You're not?

37:46.530 --> 37:48.930
No.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.662
Then who the hell are you?

37:51.736 --> 37:53.761
Huh?

37:57.208 --> 37:59.301
You're about to find out.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.708
Hey! Hey!
I got him!

38:06.784 --> 38:09.218
Let him go!

38:09.287 --> 38:13.986
If I can't whip this wimp,
I'll enlist in the Waves.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.526
Watch out for the left.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.562
- And watch out for the right.
- Thanks a lot.

38:18.629 --> 38:22.030
<i>- De nada.
- No fighting! No fighting!</i>

38:22.099 --> 38:24.829
Against the rules!

38:37.415 --> 38:40.851
If I wasn't so drunk, I'd swear that
was Ozzie Rabbit fightin' that gorilla.

38:40.918 --> 38:43.148
Well, that is Ozzie Rabbit!
No way.

38:44.922 --> 38:47.891
Hit him, Ozzie!

38:47.958 --> 38:50.188
<i>Hit 'em, Ozzie.!</i>

38:50.261 --> 38:54.527
Shore patrol! Hey!

39:00.838 --> 39:04.035
Right to the belly! You gotta
go downstairs! That hurts!

39:05.343 --> 39:07.777
Yeah!

39:18.289 --> 39:20.348
Ho!

39:25.629 --> 39:29.429
He's kickboxing! Can he do that? Well, I didn't
hear nobody say nothin' about no rules, man!

39:35.039 --> 39:36.870
Oh, no! No! Foul! Foul!

39:43.447 --> 39:47.781
That's my buddy. He's in Macs-1
with me. Oh, you radar operator too?

39:47.852 --> 39:50.218
<i>You want me to hold him for you?</i>

39:55.159 --> 39:57.787
Lee!

39:57.862 --> 40:00.330
Kenji! Kenji!

40:06.237 --> 40:09.673
<i>Come on, Ozzie.! Come on.!</i>

40:19.583 --> 40:23.349
<i>Get up, Ozzie.! Get up.!</i>

40:23.421 --> 40:25.616
<i>Come on.! Get up.!</i>

40:27.358 --> 40:29.622
<i>Get up.! Get up.!</i>

40:37.701 --> 40:40.966
<i>I'm ready for my lesson, Sarge.</i>

40:42.039 --> 40:45.008
Huh?

40:45.075 --> 40:48.875
Lee, come on. Come on, Lee.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.346
- Get out of here!
- Hey, come on. It's over, Oswald.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.349
It's not over till I get my lesson.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.544
Sam, put down that gun.

40:55.619 --> 40:59.146
We'll grab a drink, we'll go upstairs, take our women up there
- Back off!

41:00.758 --> 41:03.352
- Sam, listen to me!
- I'm waiting.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.554
Teach me my damn lesson.

41:07.631 --> 41:10.998
<i>- Come on, Sarge.
- Gooshie, I can't get through to him.!</i>

41:11.068 --> 41:14.970
<i>Tell Ziggy I've got to have a way
to get through to him.!</i>

41:18.409 --> 41:20.934
You're kidding.

41:21.011 --> 41:23.502
Uh- Uh, Sam-

41:23.581 --> 41:28.644
Sam, what are the four, uh, fundamental forces
of interactions in quantum physics?

41:28.719 --> 41:32.018
Come on, Sergeant.

41:32.089 --> 41:36.753
<i>What are the four fundamental forces
of interactions in quantum physics, Sam?</i>

41:37.828 --> 41:43.494
<i>Yeah, yeah. Sam, the four fundamental
forces of interactions in-in quantum physics?</i>

41:46.103 --> 41:50.233
Gravitation,
electromagnetism,

41:51.442 --> 41:55.902
the strong and weak
nuclear forces.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.972
<i>What's the Pauli exclusion principle?</i>

42:00.251 --> 42:06.053
No two fermions can occupy a given
quantum state at the same time.

42:07.758 --> 42:10.522
Neither can two human souls.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.235
Can you help me?

42:26.310 --> 42:29.575
I used to be stationed here. I'm
looking for a couple of my buddies.

42:29.647 --> 42:33.208
I'm sort of new here myself. You got a
company roster or maybe the duty list?

42:33.284 --> 42:35.275
Uh, let me see.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.585
I'm still him.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.892
Uh, Sam,
you're still Oswald,

42:46.964 --> 42:50.058
I know.
Only you're no longer in Atsugi.

42:50.134 --> 42:55.504
Uh, you're stationed at, uh,
Macs-9 in Tustin, California.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.973
It's 1959.

42:58.042 --> 43:01.102
Why do I keep leaping
into Lee Harvey Oswald?

43:01.178 --> 43:05.842
Well, Ziggy still insists that it's to uncover a conspiracy
- uh, stop what happened in Dallas.

43:05.916 --> 43:10.751
Sam, is Oswald still in-
I don't know. I don't know.

43:12.856 --> 43:15.290
Why did I leap out ofJapan?

43:15.359 --> 43:20.058
Well, there's some data indicating that
originally Oswald killed Sergeant Lopez.

43:20.130 --> 43:22.064
And I was there to stop that?

43:22.132 --> 43:26.000
Well, Lopez saved the lives
of 17 marines at Khe Sanh,

43:26.070 --> 43:29.369
<i>and he was given the Congressional
Medal of Honor posthumously.</i>

43:32.443 --> 43:35.344
I gotta find the duty roster.
Duty roster.

43:35.412 --> 43:37.346
Yeah.

43:37.414 --> 43:39.780
<i>Oh, here- duty roster.</i>

43:39.850 --> 43:42.683
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

43:42.753 --> 43:45.187
<i>Do you often read
The Daily Worker?</i>

43:51.862 --> 43:54.660
It's the only newspaper
that tells the truth.

43:54.732 --> 43:58.293
The truth?
How the United States...

43:58.369 --> 44:02.533
oppresses the proletariat of the
world with its military might.

44:02.606 --> 44:04.665
He's back.

44:04.742 --> 44:07.472
You sound like a communist.
I know. I know.

44:07.544 --> 44:10.707
But you're not? I'm not
what I sometimes sound like.

44:10.781 --> 44:16.310
- Oh, good. That's better, Sam.
- But if I were, I'd be a Marxist.

44:16.387 --> 44:20.221
If you're a Marxist, what the hell
are you doing the in the Marine Corps?

44:20.290 --> 44:22.815
I don't know.

44:31.001 --> 44:33.561
We are all ears, Mr. Oswald.

44:39.743 --> 44:42.837
<i>We're waiting.
Waiting?</i>

44:42.913 --> 44:47.213
- Yes, for your knowledge.
- My knowledge. Right.

44:47.284 --> 44:52.881
<i>When you told our consulate in Helsinki
that you wanted to defect, you said-</i>

44:59.630 --> 45:04.226
"I am willing to share all knowledge
I acquired during my service...

45:04.301 --> 45:07.600
<i>"in the United States Marine Corps.</i>

45:07.671 --> 45:10.970
"I do this to repudiate
my former country...

45:11.041 --> 45:14.704
and to demonstrate
my loyalty to the Soviet Union. "

45:21.251 --> 45:23.242
Could I have a glass of water, please?

46:00.724 --> 46:03.454
Thank you.

46:24.381 --> 46:26.315
Ahh.

46:38.195 --> 46:41.426
I'm sorry.
This is such a nice desk.

47:15.165 --> 47:19.534
Once my father, as a punishment
for a menial infraction...

47:19.603 --> 47:21.537
which I can't remember,

47:21.605 --> 47:26.941
made me stand naked
on the boat dock behind our house.

47:27.010 --> 47:31.106
I was, uh, 10.

47:31.181 --> 47:36.380
Old enough to be embarrassed
had anyone witnessed my nakedness.

47:36.453 --> 47:41.356
But there was no one, because only my father
was crazy enough to winter with his family...

47:41.425 --> 47:44.883
on a lake inside the Arctic Circle.

47:44.962 --> 47:47.192
Yes, it was winter.

47:47.264 --> 47:49.892
The water was frozen
two meters deep...

47:49.967 --> 47:53.403
and the snow came up
to the nipples on my chest.

47:55.539 --> 47:59.908
The frostbite took two toes
on my right foot, one on my left,

48:00.944 --> 48:04.846
and I missed most of the spring
recuperating from pneumonia.

48:06.617 --> 48:09.415
Despite that...

48:09.486 --> 48:13.582
and other punishments
I received at his hand as a child,

48:15.826 --> 48:18.351
I still loved the bastard.

48:18.428 --> 48:20.623
After all, he was my father.

48:24.801 --> 48:28.965
Our native lands are like that.

48:29.039 --> 48:33.806
No matter how abusive, how oppressive,
how unjust their treatment,

48:33.877 --> 48:38.644
we have this patriotic,
almost biological need to love them.

48:42.352 --> 48:46.152
<i>It is only when we attain
our political maturity...</i>

48:46.223 --> 48:48.691
we realize that no matter...

48:48.759 --> 48:53.662
how traitorous our actions
may seem in our native country,

48:54.665 --> 48:56.656
the betrayal is theirs.

48:56.733 --> 48:58.724
It's not ours.

49:09.947 --> 49:14.680
My name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

49:16.954 --> 49:19.718
<i>In the Marine Corps,</i>

49:19.790 --> 49:21.781
<i>my serial number was...</i>

49:21.858 --> 49:26.488
<i>1653230.</i>

49:28.799 --> 49:33.862
My M.O. S: 6741,

49:33.937 --> 49:36.735
aviation electronics operator.

49:39.109 --> 49:45.070
My first duty assignment
was with Macs-1 in Atsugi, Japan.

49:46.483 --> 49:51.386
I arrived there
on September the 12th, 1957.

49:58.528 --> 50:01.292
I still don't get how you do this.

50:01.365 --> 50:06.132
Well, it-it-it is a little
difficult to explain.

50:06.203 --> 50:09.570
<i>You think I'm too stupid
to understand?</i>

50:09.639 --> 50:12.130
Well, nobody understands it,
except Dr. Beckett.

50:12.209 --> 50:16.339
Try me.
Try you. Okay.

50:16.413 --> 50:20.315
Let's start with the string theory.
What's the string theory?

50:20.384 --> 50:22.375
String theory?

50:25.989 --> 50:31.552
It helped close the conceptual gulf
between relativity and quantum mechanics.

50:31.628 --> 50:37.567
It postulates that subatomic particles are not
points, but strings, about one Planck length long.

50:37.634 --> 50:42.571
The rate at which strings vibrate can
generate the properties of all known particles.

50:44.007 --> 50:47.306
<i>Hmm? How did I know that?</i>

50:52.449 --> 50:57.751
<i>Most of our time, we spent watching for bogies
out of China or North Korea.</i>

50:57.821 --> 51:03.157
<i>However, occasionally we would run a plot
for, uh, Race Car.</i>

51:03.226 --> 51:06.923
- Have you seen Race Car?
- Many times.

51:08.298 --> 51:11.699
Landings, taking off.

51:11.768 --> 51:14.430
<i>It had long and droopy wings.</i>

51:14.504 --> 51:16.472
<i>The tips sagged...</i>

51:16.540 --> 51:21.603
so that when it landed,
it sparked the runway.

51:24.147 --> 51:27.708
- What is Race Car's official designation?
- U-2.

51:27.784 --> 51:31.117
The "U" stands for utility.

51:33.056 --> 51:35.581
Our officers told us
it was a weather plane,

51:35.659 --> 51:37.786
<i>but scuttlebutt
had it that it was a...</i>

51:37.861 --> 51:42.093
a secret spy plane flying missions
over China and Russia.

51:44.034 --> 51:46.161
Is this Race Car?

51:51.875 --> 51:54.105
Yes.

51:56.379 --> 51:59.280
- Where'd you get this?
- From a friend.

51:59.349 --> 52:01.442
You have friends, don't you?

52:01.518 --> 52:04.146
No. Not really.

52:06.389 --> 52:08.789
- Not a girlfriend?
- Not anymore.

52:08.859 --> 52:13.796
<i>We'll have to do something about
it, Lieutenant Guri, eh? Da.</i>

52:13.864 --> 52:19.131
How high Race Car flew over,
uh, these missions?

52:19.202 --> 52:22.194
We estimated around
angels 9-0.

52:22.272 --> 52:24.502
Oh, that's 30,000 meters.

52:24.574 --> 52:27.873
- And the range?
- I don't know that.

52:29.446 --> 52:32.711
It would stay out at least 12 hours,
sometimes more.

52:33.783 --> 52:38.186
<i>But, of course, it could have landed
before returning to Atsugi,</i>

52:38.255 --> 52:40.189
<i>but I don't think so.</i>

52:40.257 --> 52:45.388
- Can you tell us about Race Car radar-jamming
equipment? - Didn't know it had any.

52:45.462 --> 52:48.295
Photographic equipment?

52:50.400 --> 52:53.699
So you know nothing about Race Car
defensive capabilities? Uh, Sam?

52:53.770 --> 52:58.366
- Now Oswald is you. - Can you give
me any performance figures on U-2?

52:58.441 --> 53:01.899
<i>- I mean, he's not completely you.
- It had a short takeoff...</i>

53:01.978 --> 53:05.345
around... 500 feet, no more. But
when I asked him if he understood-

53:05.415 --> 53:09.181
- Sam?
- He climbed out at about 45 degrees...

53:09.252 --> 53:14.212
through angels 4-5, which was
as high as our MPS-11 tracked.

53:14.291 --> 53:17.055
- What are you telling them?
- Anything else?

53:17.127 --> 53:19.721
- Code names and frequencies.
- No!

53:19.796 --> 53:25.701
We were Coffee Mill, and of course,
the U-2 was Race Car. Sam, zip it!

53:25.769 --> 53:30.229
We usually used 218.5
as our main channel.

53:30.307 --> 53:35.074
- Now, Comrade Oswald.
- God! Now you're him and he's you. Holy mackerel!

53:35.145 --> 53:39.013
<i>Why don't you write all this
technical data down for us.</i>

53:41.785 --> 53:43.912
No. No.
This evening after dinner.

53:43.987 --> 53:47.354
Eh, you stay at the Hotel
Berlin, are you not? I believe so.

53:47.424 --> 53:49.722
Yeah.
The food there is inedible.

53:49.793 --> 53:52.261
Why don't you ask your intourist guide,
uh, what's her name?

53:52.329 --> 53:55.423
<i>- Rimma Shirokova.
- Yeah. Tell Rimma Shirokova to take you to Najinski's.</i>

53:55.498 --> 53:59.628
<i>They serve this wonderful venison with a
- with a mushroom stew. You would love it.</i>

53:59.703 --> 54:03.104
And now, you would be so kind and
wait in the other room for a moment.

54:44.247 --> 54:48.445
<i>Sam, I know Oswald is influencing
you, but this is ridiculous.</i>

54:54.624 --> 54:57.559
Al?
Oh, it's about time.

54:57.627 --> 55:02.121
Hey, you gotta control this Oswald stuff before
you give away every secret in the government.

55:02.198 --> 55:05.690
It just came out, okay?

55:05.769 --> 55:08.966
I think I could have stopped, but
some part of me that didn't want to.

55:09.039 --> 55:12.133
And you know about that part.

55:12.208 --> 55:15.666
Uh, I was just thinking out loud.

55:33.163 --> 55:37.122
How bad is it? It depends
on how much you told them.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.636
I think I told them everything
Oswald knew about the U-2.

55:42.072 --> 55:44.131
Gary Powers.

55:44.207 --> 55:46.141
The Russians shoot him
down next May.

55:46.209 --> 55:51.408
And that incident extends the Cold War for
years. That must be why I leaped in here, Al-

55:51.481 --> 55:56.475
to stop the Soviets from getting U-2 data
from Oswald. Oh, no. Ziggy doesn't think so.

55:56.553 --> 56:01.388
There's a 96% probability that you didn't
give the Soviets anything on the U-2...

56:01.458 --> 56:04.723
that they didn't already have.
But they shoot Powers down, right?

56:04.794 --> 56:08.321
Yeah. It was just a lucky shot
with a Sam-2. A 100-to-1 shot.

56:08.398 --> 56:13.529
It had nothing to do with anything you
- uh, Oswald told them. Thank God.

56:13.603 --> 56:16.071
Well, then why am I here in Russia?

56:16.139 --> 56:20.075
Ziggy's working on it.
I personally think it had some-

56:20.143 --> 56:22.737
You think it has something to
do with the conspiracy? Yeah.

56:22.812 --> 56:25.474
Why don't you change that record, okay?
Well, I still believe it.

56:25.548 --> 56:30.815
Al, in all of these leaps so far,
we haven't uncovered any conspiracy,

56:30.887 --> 56:34.220
<i>and we have not proven
that Oswald was not the assassin.</i>

56:34.290 --> 56:38.021
Well, maybe this one will. Yeah. But I can't
keep wandering around leap after leap like this.

56:38.094 --> 56:41.120
We gotta-We gotta take
the initiative somehow!

56:41.197 --> 56:43.529
Right!
Well, what do we do?

56:47.170 --> 56:50.003
Oh, you're not becoming
Oswald again, are you?

56:50.073 --> 56:53.201
I don't actually... become Oswald.

56:53.276 --> 56:57.144
I just sort of drift along next to him
and his thoughts come out.

56:57.213 --> 57:01.274
Oh, you're not drifting, are you?

57:01.351 --> 57:04.320
No. I'm theorizing.
Or trying to.

57:04.387 --> 57:06.719
Oh, sorry.
That's okay.

57:06.790 --> 57:10.954
I was just thinking though, what if I
prematurely exited that first leap into Oswald?

57:11.027 --> 57:13.825
The one where Marina took your picture?
Yeah. What if I leaped out...

57:13.897 --> 57:16.388
before I had a chance to put right
what once went wrong?

57:16.466 --> 57:18.696
Well, success doesn't have
anything to do with leaping.

57:18.768 --> 57:21.293
I said before I had a chance
to undo the wrong?

57:21.371 --> 57:24.135
Why would you leap before you
had the chance? If I knew that,

57:24.207 --> 57:28.405
I'd know how to get off this leaping yo-yo
so I could do whatever it was I was supposed to do.

57:28.478 --> 57:31.641
Which is stop the assassination.
Well, let's hope that's it.

57:31.714 --> 57:36.174
Sam, Ziggy says
you're on the right track.

57:36.252 --> 57:39.187
It's just gonna take time
to test your hypothesis,

57:39.255 --> 57:42.156
but you should continue
and play this scenario out.

57:42.225 --> 57:44.159
Like I got a big choice.
I didn't finish.

57:44.227 --> 57:47.321
But you gotta play it out just the
way Oswald did. No changing history.

57:47.397 --> 57:50.264
So tell me what I'm supposed to
do. You go to your hotel room.

57:50.333 --> 57:55.327
Yeah. And then before you have
dinner with your intourist guide-

57:57.574 --> 58:00.168
You commit suicide.

58:11.521 --> 58:14.251
<i>I don't like this, Al.
I don't like it either.</i>

58:14.324 --> 58:17.589
But Ziggy insists that you continue
doing exactly what Oswald did...

58:17.660 --> 58:21.027
on October 21, 1959.

58:21.097 --> 58:23.930
Which means that
in a couple of minutes,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.992
you have to slash your left wrist
with a razor blade.

58:27.070 --> 58:30.130
Yeah. Well, maybe we should just skip
that part. What are you afraid of?

58:30.206 --> 58:32.231
What am I afraid of?
Well, you're not gonna die.

58:32.308 --> 58:36.142
How can you be so sure?
Because Oswald didn't.

58:36.212 --> 58:38.237
Olga saved him.
Olga? Who's Olga?

58:38.314 --> 58:40.578
Your intourist guide.

58:40.650 --> 58:44.347
Wait a second. I thought that, uh,
Major Kosenko said that somebody-

58:44.420 --> 58:46.445
that her name was
Rimma something, right?

58:46.523 --> 58:48.491
Shirokova.
Shirokova something.

58:48.558 --> 58:53.086
Yeah, but Oswald called her Olga in his diaries,
and maybe that was his nickname for Rimma.

58:53.162 --> 58:58.395
And maybe I've already altered history and nobody
named Olga or Rimma or-or any name like that...

58:58.468 --> 59:02.700
is gonna come through that door after
I slash my wrist! Okay. Well, maybe not.

59:02.772 --> 59:06.333
For all we know you may be here to stop
Oswald from slashing his wrist. Let's see.

59:06.409 --> 59:09.207
Exactly.
Uh, okay,

59:09.279 --> 59:13.579
if Oswald doesn't attempt suicide, the
Russians kick him out of the country.

59:13.650 --> 59:17.450
He never meets Marina
- Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second.

59:17.520 --> 59:21.786
The Russians kick him out of the country?
Yeah. Oswald's six-day visa expires tonight...

59:21.858 --> 59:24.292
and the Russians
won't extend it.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.885
Maybe that's why
he attempted suicide.

59:26.963 --> 59:29.830
Doesn't that kinda blow
your K.G.B. Conspiracy theory?

59:29.899 --> 59:33.960
Well, maybe.
But it reinforces my C.I.A. Theory.

59:34.037 --> 59:37.438
Because if Oswald was C.I.A., the
Russians wouldn't want him in the country.

59:37.507 --> 59:40.305
So that's why he commits suicide,
right? Because it's in the C.I.A. Manual.

59:40.376 --> 59:42.867
What difference does it make?
What difference does it make?

59:42.946 --> 59:45.210
We're talkin' about trying
to find the truth out here.

59:45.281 --> 59:50.218
<i>And what if the truth is that at age 19,
Oswald was not a C.I.A. Agent,</i>

59:50.286 --> 59:52.220
he was not a K.G.B. Agent.

59:52.288 --> 59:56.748
Maybe he was just some
- some frustrated loser, right, who was trying to get recognition any way he could.

59:56.826 --> 59:59.420
Maybe he thought the best
way to do that was by defecting.

59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.588
But then when the Soviets
didn't want him- Uh-uh.

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:04.929
And he didn't have anybody else, so
he slit his wrists. No. Uh-uh. No, no.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.561
<i>See, the Russians wanted
defectors in '59.</i>

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:13.576
I cannot believe that the Russians had Lee
Harvey Oswald on an "A" list for defectors.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:17.579
I mean, he was a kid, right? If I remember
correctly, he never even graduated high school.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:22.346
Not exactly the kind of disillusioned American intellectual or scientist
- Sam.

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:25.080
That the Soviets like to parade
in front of the world press, right?

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:27.122
Sam. He's not anything
like that at all. What?

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.751
Sam, it's time.
Time-

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:38.657
to commit suicide? No, not commit
suicide. Attempt suicide! Attempt! Attempt!

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:43.638
Now all we have to do
is follow Oswald's diary.

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.209
Let's see. October 21-

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.905
Okay. Um,

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.177
"I must leave country
at 8:00 p. m. Tonight...

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:58.812
as visa has 'expird. "'

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:02.619
He spells "expire"
without the "E." Hmm.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:05.217
"I am shocked!
My dreams!

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:09.196
"I retire to my room.
I have $100 left.

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:14.567
"I have waited for two year
to be accepted.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:20.269
My 'fondis"'- F-O-N-D-I-S,
uh, "dreams are shattered...

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.642
because of a petty official,
because of bad planning,"

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.908
uh, "I have planned so much.

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.576
"7:00 p. m.
I decide to end it.

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:32.985
Slash 'rist"' R-I-S-T. I don't care
how he spells it. I'm not gonna do it.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.081
Oh, well, you have to.
I'm not.

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:41.063
Uh, "soak 'rist' in cold water
to numb the pain.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:44.998
<i>"Then slash my left 'rist. '</i>

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:49.869
Then I 'plaug"'- Plaug? Plaug?
What the hell is a plaug?

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:52.339
Who cares what it is?
Al, I'm not gonna do it.

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:58.369
Okay. All right. Wait a minute.
"Plaug rist into bathtub of hot water.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:04.409
"I think when Olga comes at 8:00
to find me dead will be a big shock.

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:10.426
Somewhere... a violin plays. "

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:14.144
<i>Easy, fella.</i>

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.644
Easy, fella.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.861
Marina?

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:12.741
"If I am alive and they have captured me,

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:16.835
I believe that the embassy
will come to your assistance. "

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.975
Well, you don't need this, do you?

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:38.426
The administration increased its crackdown
on Cuban exile hit-and-run raids.

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:42.767
<i>The raids based from Mexico, the
Caribbean and the southern United States...</i>

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:46.103
<i>are a stumbling block-</i>

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:55.116
I shot a man.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:03.385
I don't know if I hit him or not.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.953
It should be on the news.

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.631
General Walker.

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:24.803
That-That must be why I-
I left you that note.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.610
<i>In case they caught me.</i>

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.881
But they didn't.

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.927
I'm too smart for them.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:51.668
He was a fascist,
like Hitler.

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:54.141
<i>Don't you see?</i>

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:59.975
If someone had killed Hitler
before he came to power,

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:02.574
millions of lives
would have been saved.

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:11.890
Yes, you can.

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:14.862
He lived alone.

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:22.502
I'm listening to the radio!

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:26.871
Sam. Sam, it worked.
It worked.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:31.106
It... almost worked.
It's April 10, 1963.

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.648
And that's only a month after
your original leap into Oswald.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.617
If I killed him, there should be
something on the radio.

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.676
Killed him?

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:42.014
<i>I buried it.
Killed who?</i>

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:45.219
- Wrapped it in that raincoat and I buried it.
- Gooshie!

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:47.228
What the hell's he talking about?

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:50.129
<i>Holy mackerel.!
Sam, you leaped into Oswald...</i>

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:53.691
just seconds after he tried to blow
General Edwin Walker's head off.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:57.705
- Tried? Tried? I missed?
- Not you. Oswald!

01:07:57.773 --> 01:08:02.369
The bullet splintered the window and then punched
into the wall just inches above Walker's head.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:05.278
It was an easy shot.

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:08.316
He was just sitting there
working at his desk.

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:10.375
How could I miss?

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:13.718
You didn't miss him, Sam!
Oswald did!

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:18.158
- You don't have to yell, Al. I can hear you.
- Oh! Oh.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:22.788
<i>Well, that's better.
Sam, you're scaring the hell out of me.</i>

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.459
<i>Uh, you were acting-</i>

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:29.834
you were acting like Oswald's
mind was still merged into yours.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:33.305
President Kennedy's popularity
slipping from the high it showed...

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.343
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:37.743
<i>The White House confirmed plans-
It is.</i>

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:42.182
- No, it can't be.
- Only this time it's different.

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:45.220
No, but Ziggy said it
would be gone.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.278
Yeah? Why would it be gone?

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:52.692
Well, Ziggy computed that the reason that you
were leaping back and forth in Oswald's life...

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:57.858
was because the part of your mind that's in him and the
part of his mind that's in you were trying to, uh, reunite.

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:01.425
So, what did you do? I
didn't do- I didn't- Nothin'.

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:05.304
Ziggy is-Well, Ziggy figured that
if we could reconnect your minds,

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.308
then we could get the leap
back on track.

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.435
So through, uh, D.N.A. Typing,

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:14.540
Ziggy identified, you know, the little
mesons and neurons in Oswald's brain...

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:19.816
that biologically matched yours, and then we put Oswald in
the accelerator and we leaped those little things back to you.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:25.225
You can't leap isolated mesons and neurons
without drawing other neural energy with it.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.228
More neural energy?
Yeah.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:31.232
Sucking up more of Oswald's mind. That's why
this leap is different. There's more of him in me.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.564
More?

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.866
There's more?

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.181
I can't destroy this.

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:59.352
This is my plan.
Oh, no, Sam.

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:07.860
I planned this like
a military operation.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:11.930
Reconnaissance photos,
time tables, escape routes.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:17.202
Even my political justification
for the execution.

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:20.248
Sam. Sam, look at me.
It should have worked.

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:22.250
Sam, look at me!

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.309
My aim was perfect.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.422
It was an accident that I missed.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.928
He dropped his head at the last second,
or he'd be dead.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.965
He'd be dead,

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:40.559
and the world would remember
Lee Harvey Oswald...

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:46.074
as the man who executed
General Edwin Walker.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.770
"Hands off Cuba. "

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:59.019
Hands off Cuba. Hands off Cuba!

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:03.252
Hands off Cuba! Hands off Cuba!

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:07.125
Hands off Cuba! Oh, I don't
truck with communist propaganda.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.790
What makes you think this
is communist propaganda?

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:12.390
Oh, because everybody know
that Castro is a communist.

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:19.171
I'm not Castro. No. But y'all
are supportin' him, aren't you?

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:22.938
No. I'm supporting Cuba.
Although, I must admit that I admire him...

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:27.472
the same way I admire George Washington.
Ellie, we only have a half hour.

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.450
Y'all are comparing Fidel Castro
to George Washington?

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:36.321
Uh-huh. Castro is doing what Washington
did, leading his country in a revolution.

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:38.917
It's not the same.
No?

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:41.462
No!
Well, why not?

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.964
I don't know. It's just
not the same. Ellie!

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:47.662
I'll be right there.
I'll order you a salad.

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.829
Gee, I don't want you
to miss your lunch.

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:53.432
Oh, it'll be good for my figure.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:12:00.511
Uh, so how do you equate the American Revolution
with, uh, the communist takeover in Cuba?

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:05.679
We kicked out King George.
Castro kicked out Batiste. It seems the same to me.

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:08.222
But it's not. Castro is a
communist. Hands off Cuba.

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:11.418
Well, whatever he is,
Castro just wants Cuba to have...

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:14.053
the same opportunity
for self-determination that we did.

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:17.656
Hands off Cuba.
Y'all sound like you know him.

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.860
We've had the same teacher.

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:22.870
Would you like to join
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:25.270
I'm secretary of
the New Orleans chapter.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:29.675
I could sign you up right now
for only a dollar and a quarter.

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:37.185
Y'all have social functions? Well, now,
we don't. But that is an awful good idea.

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:40.085
More folks will come to a dance
than will come to a political meeting.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:42.487
Course, once you got 'em in there-

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:46.494
You are something, Ellie.
You are really something.

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:50.328
Hey, you know my name, but I don't
know yours. I only know half your name.

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:55.399
The other half's La Forge.
Ellie La Forge.

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:57.939
Ellie La Forge.

01:12:58.006 --> 01:13:01.066
Hidell. Alex Hidell.

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:10.785
Y'all are married.
Yes. My wife lives in Dallas.

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:13.583
Y'all didn't tell me
y'all were married.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:28.034
Fair play for Cuba!

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.697
Traitor! Traitor!
Fair play for Cuba!

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:33.469
You see this fellow.
He is a communist.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.567
Fair play for Cuba!
Communist!

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:40.138
And he wants to do to your country
what he did to us in Cuba!

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:42.149
<i>Fair play for Cuba!
Communist.!</i>

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:45.209
Gooshie, you got a lock on him?
Now just hold it there- Uh-oh!

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:48.279
<i>A couple of days ago,
he tried tojoin us.</i>

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:52.555
He said he wanted to fight for Cuba!
To bring down Castro!

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:56.428
Liar!
Okay, Carlos.

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:59.262
If you want to hit me, hit me.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:02.098
<i>He's doing exactly what
Oswald did.! With pleasure.</i>

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.503
Freeze! Up against the wall and
spread 'em! He's a communist!

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.838
Up against the wall and shut
up! Sam, can you hear me?

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.878
It's the 9th of August, 1963.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:15.110
There's only three months until the Kennedy
assassination, Sam, and each leap is putting you closer.

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:20.349
If you leap into Dallas on November 22
and Oswald is still in control,

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.583
you won't be able to
change anything, Sam!

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:25.058
You've got to fight him!
Fight him, Sam!

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.028
<i>What's your name, boy?</i>

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:31.998
My name?
Dr. Samuel Beckett!

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:36.197
My name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:41.334
<i>Three years ago, I said that, uh-</i>

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:44.106
<i>Introduced myself in Paris
by saying that I was the man...</i>

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:46.670
<i>who had accompanied,
uh, Mrs. Kennedy to Paris.</i>

01:14:46.748 --> 01:14:51.048
I'm getting, uh, somewhat that same
sensation, uh, as I travel around, uh, Texas.

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:57.548
Nobody wonders
what Lyndon and I wear.

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:13.535
I'm glad to be here in,
uh, Jim Wright's city.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:17.238
<i>About, uh, 35, uh-</i>

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.253
<i>I appreciate your being
here this morning.</i>

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:31.918
Mrs. Kennedy is
organizing herself.

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:35.521
<i>It takes longer.</i>

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:38.395
<i>That's because she looks
better than we do.</i>

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.966
Looks like it's gonna rain.

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:41.780
What's in the package?

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.011
Curtain rods.

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:12.876
<i>Ziggy computes the best option under
the circumstances is to do nothing.</i>

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:15.007
Well, Ziggy doesn't want to
make another mistake.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:18.382
Perhaps. But if Dr. Beckett leaped
into Oswald to uncover the conspiracy,

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:21.945
then doing nothing is an effective course
of action. How the hell do you figure that?

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:25.652
<i>Whether Dr. Beckett is himself
or Lee Harvey Oswald is immaterial.</i>

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:30.790
Either way, you'll be there to observe, to watch the sixth
floor window, the grassy knoll, the railroad overpass.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:34.461
You'll see it all. You'll know the
truth. But I won't be able to stop it.

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:39.269
I realize that, Admiral, but you yourself said
that wasn't what Dr. Beckett was leaped back to do.

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:43.334
Well, what if I was wrong? What if that's
precisely the reason that Sam was leaped back?

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.845
Then Oswald would have to be
the sole assassin. That's right.

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:47.973
No conspiracy?
No!

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:53.146
Just one angry, envious man who-
who wanted to propel himself into infamy.

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.246
But one lone man?

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:58.156
I know it's more comforting
to believe in plots.

01:19:58.226 --> 01:20:02.788
Because if Kennedy could be killed that easily by
one sicko, what hope is there for the rest of us?

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:04.855
Admiral, what are you gonna do?

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:07.766
I'm gonna try and find the truth.

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:19.036
Hey, Lee.

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:22.606
What's the hurry?

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:44.997
The morning overcast
has given way to blue skies...

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:48.907
<i>and the local democratic party is predicting
a record-breaking big "D"turnout...</i>

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:51.377
<i>for President Kennedy
and his first lady.</i>

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:54.313
<i>Mrs. Kennedy has been given
a large bouquet of roses...</i>

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.350
<i>by admirers here in Love Field...</i>

01:20:56.418 --> 01:21:02.118
<i>as she and the president stopped to greet this
crowd, which is completely covering the airport fence.</i>

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.852
<i>This motorcade will
get off to a late start.</i>

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:09.989
<i>There arejust too many people here in an
amazing display of goodwill to the Kennedys.</i>

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:52.201
<i>I think I'm gonna go down there
and catch some of that parade.</i>

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:58.144
<i>I admire the president very much. You
admire him, but you're going to kill him.</i>

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:01.410
<i>That's what this is about. You're
Secret Service and you're detaining me...</i>

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.542
because you think I'm going to
shoot the president!

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.813
<i>I know you're gonna
shoot the president.</i>

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.879
What I want to know is:
Are you acting alone?

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:11.016
I don't even own a gun!

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:15.893
You own a 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle and an S&W.38 Special.

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:18.489
The rifle is wrapped in a blanket
at Ruth Paine's house...

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:22.058
and the pistol is at your rooming house
at 1026 North Beckley!

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:28.042
You ordered both of these guns through
the mail under the alias of Alex J. Hidell.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:32.307
Marina. She told you these lies.
Marina told me nothing.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.907
But when questioned, she'll talk about
the shot you took at General Walker,

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:39.943
and she'll talk about locking you
in the bathroom when Nixon came to Dallas...

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:43.354
'cause she was afraid you were gonna
try and shoot him too. I want a lawyer.

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:46.417
There's no lawyer here.
There's just me and you and the truth.

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:50.430
I know my rights. I'm a member
of the A.C.L.U., and I have-

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:57.433
You're going to shoot the president from the
sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository.

01:22:57.505 --> 01:23:00.599
You're crazy! Yeah, you're
damn right I'm crazy.

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:03.974
I'm crazy enough to blow your brains out
your ear if I don't get the truth.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:16.813
A large police escort is now-

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:24.623
What color is her suit?

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:34.370
<i>And now ticker tape is beginning to flow from
the windows and engulf the whole motorcade.</i>

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:36.467
Here comes the first car
with the police chief,

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:39.604
<i>and here is the president
of the United States.</i>

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.649
<i>The crowd is going absolutely wild.</i>

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:45.083
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas...</i>

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:49.021
<i>as the president
and the first lady pass by.</i>

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:52.821
<i>There were some fears of demonstrations
here in downtown Dallas,</i>

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:56.261
<i>but this crowd is radiating love
to the president.</i>

01:23:56.331 --> 01:24:01.291
<i>Dallas Police Department is working with some
force to ensure that an unfortunate incident,</i>

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:06.397
<i>similar to those that accompanied U.N. Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson do not occur on this trip.</i>

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:12.174
<i>- I don't believe in killing someonejust because I disagree with their politics.
- Are you acting alone?</i>

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:15.774
L- I want a lawyer-

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:20.844
<i>- I'm deaf! I'm deaf!
- You're going to be dead in a minute if you don't tell me the truth!</i>

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:24.221
Okay. Okay.
Don't hurt me.

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.954
I'm not gonna shoot the president.

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:30.691
- But... I know who is.
- Who?

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.598
Hidell.

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:38.537
The guy who ordered the guns
through the mail.

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.938
<i>He's the one who-</i>

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.179
- I'm lying, Al.
- Sam.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.716
<i>There is no conspiracy.</i>

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:53.686
I'm acting alone,
and you've got to stop me.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:57.122
But I can't reach you, Sam. He's
taken over completely. You have to.

01:24:57.192 --> 01:25:00.787
You have to or it's gonna
happen all over again.

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:04.320
You have to find...

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.390
Hidell.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.132
Find Alex J. Hidell.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:15.532
That's the man who's gonna
shoot the president.

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:32.850
Sam!
Sam, listen to me! Sam!

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:35.418
I've got to reach you, Sam!

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:43.531
Sam, what are the four fundamental
forces of interactions in quantum physics?

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.473
Sam.

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:50.170
Sam, explain
the Pauli exclusion principle.

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:56.908
Sam, what is supersymmetry?
And how does it apply-

01:25:58.052 --> 01:26:00.987
This is never gonna work.
It's all happening again.

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:04.456
It's November 22, 1963,
and it's all happening again!

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:13.967
Sam! Sam!
It's November 22, 1963!

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:18.563
Sam, and your dad is still alive! He's
teaching you to drive a tractor, Sam.

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:25.909
<i>It's
- It's Elkridge, Indiana. You're 10 years old, and your dad is teaching you to drive a tractor.</i>

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:31.316
<i>At this very moment, your dad is still alive
and he's teaching you to drive a tractor, Sam.!</i>

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:38.086
<i>On the farm in Indiana.!</i>

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:40.354
<i>He's still alive.!</i>

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:44.655
Dad.

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.609
No!

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:02.844
No!

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:27.266
<i>Just now we have received
reports here at Parkland...</i>

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:30.470
<i>that Governor Connelly
was shot in the upper left chest...</i>

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:34.641
<i>and the first unconfirmed reports
say the president was hit in the head.</i>

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:39.449
<i>I repeat, an unconfirmed report
that the president was hit in the head.</i>

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.980
<i>The president's wife, Jackie Kennedy, was
not hurt. She walked into the hospital.</i>

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:46.993
Thanks, Al.

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:50.053
If you hadn't reached me,

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:56.663
I would have shot
- No, it wouldn't have been you pulling that trigger, Sam. Not really.

01:27:56.738 --> 01:28:00.037
And then when I-

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:03.942
I- I had a chance to save him,
I leaped.

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:06.810
Why, Al? Why?

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:09.008
Oswald's mind
finally reconnected.

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:14.817
And when it did, he leaped back and you leaped into
the nearest person that could accomplish your mission.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:18.518
But I didn't accomplish it.
Well, maybe you did.

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.686
I didn't save him.

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:26.166
No. But it doesn't look like
that's what you were here to do.

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:31.661
Ziggy thinks you
were here to save her.

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:35.971
Your Swiss-cheesed mind probably
doesn't remember, but the first time...

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:39.878
<i>Oswald killed Jackie too.</i>
