WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.233
WE ARE SO LUCKY

00:02.233 --> 00:03.234
THE HURRICANE ONLY DAMAGED
GRAYSON'S HOUSE.

00:03.234 --> 00:04.675
MM.
YES.

00:04.675 --> 00:07.007
THAT WAS REALLY LUCKY.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.179
I LOVE THAT
YOU GUYS ARE FORCED

00:08.179 --> 00:11.112
TO LIVE HERE TOGETHER
UNTIL YOUR PLACE IS FIXED.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.013
IT'S LIKE "THE REAL WORLD,"

00:13.013 --> 00:15.486
IF THEY DID IT
WITH OLD AND BORING PEOPLE.

00:15.486 --> 00:17.388
YOU KNOW WHAT MY WAKE-UP PRESENT
WAS THIS MORNING?

00:17.388 --> 00:19.390
THIS ONE FORGOT TO FLUSH
HER PEE.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.392
IT'S CALLED "BEING GREEN."

00:21.392 --> 00:24.095
(chuckles) I'M SORRY I CARE
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET.

00:24.095 --> 00:25.156
THINK OF THE CHILDREN.

00:25.156 --> 00:26.357
(chuckles) I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE

00:26.357 --> 00:28.359
YOU WERE SO PASSIONATE
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:28.359 --> 00:30.201
JUST TRY TO KNOW ME, OKAY?

00:30.201 --> 00:31.202
(chuckles)

00:31.202 --> 00:33.204
(whispers) OKAY. BYE.

00:33.204 --> 00:34.705
FORGOT TO FLUSH, DIDN'T YA?

00:34.705 --> 00:35.806
YEAH.

00:35.806 --> 00:41.041
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:41.041 --> 00:43.244
(sighs) I NEED COFFEE.

00:43.244 --> 00:47.078
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
ON MY COMPUTER

00:47.078 --> 00:50.181
WITH ARMY BOYFRIEND WADE
BUMPIN' CYBER-UGLIES.

00:50.181 --> 00:53.424
WHEN I BUSTED OPEN MY
AMERICAN FLAG BRA, IT WAS LIKE,

00:53.424 --> 00:55.186
TALI-BAM!

00:55.186 --> 00:58.189
ENOUGH SEX TALK. IT'S NOT FAIR
TO LOVER BOY OVER THERE.

00:58.189 --> 01:01.232
LOOK AT HIM. HE'S GLAZED OVER,
JUST COUNTING THE SECONDS

01:01.232 --> 01:04.064
TILL HE CAN GET TO HIS ROOM
FOR A SOLO SESH.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.237
SERIOUSLY?
WOULD YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE?

01:06.237 --> 01:08.499
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU DO UP THERE
IS YOUR BUSINESS.

01:08.499 --> 01:10.271
PRAYING FOR DEATH
RIGHT NOW.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.843
(chuckles) WHAT?
IT'S SO NATURAL. I DO IT.

01:12.843 --> 01:15.146
OHH. THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A MARK.
I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE,

01:15.146 --> 01:16.747
BUT I NEED TO SHUT IT DOWN
FOR A MINUTE.

01:16.747 --> 01:18.279
ELLIE IS JUST JEALOUS

01:18.279 --> 01:21.582
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
TO BRINGING THE SEXY,

01:21.582 --> 01:24.255
I AM LIKE A HEART ATTACK
IN A THONG.

01:24.255 --> 01:26.257
(knuckles crack)
SERIOUSLY.
ONE TIME I KILLED A GUY

01:26.257 --> 01:29.089
AND BROUGHT HIM BACK
WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.692
THAT IS A FAKE STORY.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.265
I FEEL SORRY
FOR ALL THE UNEMPLOYED DRIFTERS

01:34.265 --> 01:36.767
THAT HAVE HAD TO WATCH YOU
FLAIL AROUND NAKED

01:36.767 --> 01:38.269
LIKE YOU'RE BEING ELECTROCUTED.

01:38.269 --> 01:39.770
(imitates electricity crackling)
(high-pitched voice) "WHAT?"

01:39.770 --> 01:41.672
(strained voice) "IT'S SO GOOD."
(imitates electricity crackling)

01:41.672 --> 01:45.105
BESIDES,IAM MUCH SEXIER
THAN YOU.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.278
OKAY. YOU BOTH HAVE
YOUR STRENGTHS.

01:47.278 --> 01:49.210
YOU ARE CREATIVE.
YES.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.881
YOU'RE FLEXIBLE.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.444
YOU'VE GOT DADDY ISSUES,
WHICH... THAT'S ALWAYS FUN,

01:53.444 --> 01:55.486
AND YOU'RE CLASSY,

01:55.486 --> 01:58.449
BUT YOU HAVE A DARK SIDE
THAT DRAWS YOU IN.

01:58.449 --> 02:00.151
I'M LIKE THE DEXTER OF SEX.

02:00.151 --> 02:02.423
I LOVE YOU,
AND THEN I WILL KILL YOU.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.155
IN ORDER TO PROVE
WHO'S BETTER,

02:04.155 --> 02:06.897
YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY
YOU'VE BOTH SLEPT WITH.

02:06.897 --> 02:09.129
OKAY, SO I WENT THROUGH
YOUR LISTS OF SEXUAL PARTNERS,

02:09.129 --> 02:10.631
AND, UH... (chuckles)

02:10.631 --> 02:13.164
LET ME TELL YA,
THAT'S A LOT OF NAMES.

02:13.164 --> 02:14.235
(gasps)
(whispers) OHH.

02:14.235 --> 02:19.170
HOS.
ANYWAY, MEET OUR HERO...

02:19.170 --> 02:20.471
VINCENT HAWTHORNE.

02:20.471 --> 02:21.912
VINCENT.

02:21.912 --> 02:25.246
I HELPED HIM BLOW THROUGH
HIS TRUST FUND IN THE '90s.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.818
YOU MUST HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB,
BECAUSE IN 2007,

02:27.818 --> 02:29.149
HE WAS "VINNY,"

02:29.149 --> 02:31.752
AND HE WORKED
AT A CAR WASH IN TAMPA.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.326
(whispers)
OHH. VINCENT, NO.

02:35.326 --> 02:36.687
WOW. YOU GUYS WEREN'T GONNA
MOVE IN TOGETHER

02:36.687 --> 02:38.189
UNTIL YOU GOT MARRIED.

02:38.189 --> 02:39.760
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.761
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.932
NOPE. (chuckles)

02:41.932 --> 02:44.335
LYNN'S OFF HER GAME TODAY.
(chuckles)

02:44.335 --> 02:45.666
(chuckles)
I'M NOT OFF MY G--

02:45.666 --> 02:47.298
YOU JUST GOT HERE.

02:47.298 --> 02:50.301
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW HOW I NEVER
LIKE TO TOOT MY OWN HORN.

02:50.301 --> 02:51.672
(whispers) WOW.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.904
ABOUT US MOVING IN TOGETHER--
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL

02:53.904 --> 02:56.447
BECAUSE I AM INCREDIBLY EASY
TO LIVE WITH.

02:56.447 --> 02:58.279
MERP!(chuckles)

02:58.279 --> 02:59.310
THAT'S THE NOISE
I'M GONNA MAKE

02:59.310 --> 03:01.181
EVERY TIME YOU TOOT
YOUR OWN HORN.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.854
YOU KNOW I HATE WHEN PEOPLE
USE NOISES FOR WORDS.

03:03.854 --> 03:05.856
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS THINK
IT'S GONNA BE EASIER

03:05.856 --> 03:07.518
BECAUSE YOU'VE BOTH BEEN
MARRIED BEFORE,

03:07.518 --> 03:09.520
BUT SOMETIMES IT WORKS
AGAINST YOU.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.523
SOMETIMES PEOPLE PLACE
THEIR EX'S BAGGAGE

03:12.523 --> 03:14.565
ONTO THEIR CURRENT PARTNER.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.267
THAT'S DUMB.

03:16.267 --> 03:17.298
(both laugh)

03:17.298 --> 03:19.199
I KNOW, RIGHT? (laughs)
(mouths words)

03:19.199 --> 03:21.372
SURVEY SAYS...
(blows raspberry)

03:21.372 --> 03:22.533
(both laugh)

03:22.533 --> 03:23.874
I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING.

03:23.874 --> 03:24.875
(chuckles)

03:24.875 --> 03:27.508
WHAT?
EARLIER TODAY, I GOT A MAN

03:27.508 --> 03:30.841
TO SAY "I'M SORRY" TO HIS WIFE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

03:30.841 --> 03:34.385
OKAY, GRANTED, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO UNSTRANGLE HER.

03:34.385 --> 03:35.946
GRR.
OH. (coughs)

03:35.946 --> 03:37.248
(strained voice)
HELP ME, LYNN. (coughs)

03:37.248 --> 03:38.249
TELL MY STORY.

03:38.249 --> 03:39.590
(chuckles)

03:39.590 --> 03:40.921
OH.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.694
BOBBY, YOU CAN'T DRINK WINE
ON THE COUCH ANYMORE.

03:43.694 --> 03:45.556
YOU ALWAYS SPILL.

03:45.556 --> 03:46.627
DO NOT.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.359
WINE.

03:48.359 --> 03:49.730
MOTOR OIL.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.402
MUSTARD.

03:51.402 --> 03:53.404
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU EVEN GET
MUSTARD ON THE CEILING?

03:53.404 --> 03:55.536
MUSTARD FIGHT.
HE STARTED IT.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.268
BY DARING YOU TO START
A MUSTARD FIGHT.

03:57.268 --> 04:00.311
OH, YOU'RE JUST AS MESSY
AS ME.

04:00.311 --> 04:01.712
OH, REALLY?

04:01.712 --> 04:03.814
WHITE SHIRT CHALLENGE.

04:03.814 --> 04:06.417
FIRST PERSON WHO GETS A STAIN
ON THEIR SHIRT LOSES.

04:06.417 --> 04:09.350
NO NAPKINS. NO MERCY.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.421
GAME ON.

04:10.421 --> 04:11.682
GREAT. (chuckles)

04:11.682 --> 04:14.355
(gasps) OH, WOULD YOU LIKE
A BURRITO?

04:14.355 --> 04:15.986
MM.
GO OUT FOR IT.

04:15.986 --> 04:17.758
OOH! (makes whooshing sound)

04:18.789 --> 04:20.661
I'M OPEN!
IT'S A TRICK!

04:20.661 --> 04:23.634
(whooshes)

04:25.336 --> 04:27.738
I JUST DID THAT
TO MY OWN HOUSE.

04:27.738 --> 04:29.570
(man) Yeah.
I-I remember both of you two.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.303
What's up, girls? You want to
come over... together?

04:32.303 --> 04:33.374
OH, THAT WOULD SETTLE IT.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.376
NO.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.579
HEY, VINNY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE FIRST MET

04:38.579 --> 04:40.311
AND I ASKED YOU
IF YOU WERE THAT ACTOR

04:40.311 --> 04:42.453
FROM
"THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS"...
(door opens)

04:42.453 --> 04:44.284
AND YOU SAID YES,
AND THEN WE HAD SEX

04:44.284 --> 04:45.456
THAT WASSOHOT...
(door closes)

04:45.456 --> 04:47.988
I TOTALLY FORGAVE YOU
FOR LYING?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.420
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SHH!

04:49.420 --> 04:51.622
VINCENT, REMEMBER
THAT SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS

04:51.622 --> 04:54.525
WE MADE LOVE ALL WEEKEND
AT YOUR BEACH HOUSE?

04:54.525 --> 04:55.666
I'LL BE BACK.

04:55.666 --> 04:58.369
HERE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS
TO JOG YOUR MEMORY--

04:58.369 --> 05:00.070
CHAMPAGNE, STABLE,

05:00.070 --> 05:02.833
A HORSE THAT WANTED
TO LOOK AWAY BUT COULDN'T.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.975
STABLE? (chuckles) I CAN'T EVEN
GET HER ON THE DAYBED.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.478
OKAY, ALL ADULTS,
PLEASE STOP SHARING WITH ME.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.710
HEY, VINNY, BUDDY,
UH, THIS DOESN'T END

05:09.710 --> 05:11.612
TILL YOU SAY
WHO WAS SEXIER, SO...

05:11.612 --> 05:13.514
Yeah, got to go with Ellie.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.645
NO!
YES!

05:14.645 --> 05:16.487
OH! I HAVE TO STRETCH.

05:16.487 --> 05:19.490
I DON'T WANT TO PULL A MUSCLE
WHEN I GET MY GLOAT ON.

05:19.490 --> 05:23.323
COME ON!
I WAS GONNA DO AIR SPLITS!

05:23.323 --> 05:26.326
YOU KNOW, LIVING WITH YOU
IS GOING TO BE A CAKEWALK.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.828
OHH. (chuckles)

05:27.828 --> 05:30.831
YOU KNOW, IT'S TRICKY TO WALK
AROUND HOLDING A BUNCH OF CAKES.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.104
I THINK THAT "CAKEWALK" SHOULD
MEAN SOMETHING REALLY HARD.

05:34.104 --> 05:36.367
(sighs) NO. I HATE IT
WHEN YOU DO THAT, OKAY?

05:36.367 --> 05:38.469
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
THE MEANING OF PHRASES.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.640
AGREE ON THE CHANGE?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.811
CHANGE APPROVED.

05:40.811 --> 05:41.912
NO, YOU... (laughs)

05:41.912 --> 05:43.514
YOU...
(high-pitched voice, laughs)

05:43.514 --> 05:44.615
(normal voice) I'M GONNA GO WALK
AROUND THE HOUSE...

05:44.615 --> 05:46.517
(clenches teeth)
AND CALM DOWN. (chuckles)

05:46.517 --> 05:48.018
OKAY.
HAVE A GOOD TIME, SWEETIE.

05:48.018 --> 05:50.681
(chuckles)
HE DOES THAT NOW.

05:50.681 --> 05:52.352
OH, CAN YOU BELIEVE
MY SHRINK?
(door opens and closes)

05:52.352 --> 05:54.685
(chuckles) GRAYSON AND I
ARE NOT GONNA HAVE

05:54.685 --> 05:56.487
A HARD TIME
LIVING TOGETHER.

05:56.487 --> 05:57.888
EH.

05:57.888 --> 06:01.031
OKAY, THAT IS MY LEAST FAVORITE
NOISE-FOR-WORD SUBSTITUTE

06:01.031 --> 06:03.394
BECAUSE YOU ONLY DO IT
WHEN YOU THINK I'M BEING DUMB.

06:03.394 --> 06:04.395
YOUAREBEING DUMB.

06:04.395 --> 06:05.896
HALFWAY FINISHED.

06:05.896 --> 06:07.137
FEELING BETTER.

06:07.137 --> 06:10.040
REALLY SHARING A HOUSE
IS LIKE BEING TRAPPED

06:10.040 --> 06:12.473
IN A SUBMARINE FOREVER.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.505
AT SOME POINT,

06:14.505 --> 06:17.377
SOMEONE'S GONNA FREAK, OPEN
THE HATCH, AND KILL EVERYONE.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.109
OH, PLEASE.
YOU SOUND LIKE LYNN.

06:19.109 --> 06:20.651
SHE'S GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING.
(door opens)

06:20.651 --> 06:21.952
OH.
(door closes)

06:21.952 --> 06:23.554
HEY, YO, EARTH DAY.
MM.

06:23.554 --> 06:26.056
I FOUND THESE PLASTIC BOTTLES
IN YOUR TRASH.

06:26.056 --> 06:27.488
(gasps) OH, YEAH.
(chuckles)

06:27.488 --> 06:29.890
I MEANT TO SEPARATE THEM
AND PUT THEM...

06:29.890 --> 06:31.922
IN WHATEVER
YOU PUT THEM IN.

06:33.424 --> 06:34.595
(chuckling) OKAY.
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

06:34.595 --> 06:36.567
TO KEEP THIS UP.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.068
I'M NOT GREEN.

06:38.068 --> 06:39.500
I JUST SAID THAT
'CAUSE I WAS EMBARRASSED

06:39.500 --> 06:42.433
TO SAY I FORGOT TO FLUSH.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.806
P.S.--I DID IT AGAIN
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.038
(chuckles) I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
LIVING WITH YOU FOR ONE DAY,

06:48.038 --> 06:50.140
AND NOW YOU'RE ALREADY
LYING TO ME?

06:50.140 --> 06:51.542
OH, IT FEELS GREAT, JULES,

06:51.542 --> 06:53.744
YOU KNOW, TO LIVE
IN A HOUSE OF LIES.

06:53.744 --> 06:55.516
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

06:55.516 --> 06:58.148
(chuckles) AREYOUSERIOUS?

06:58.148 --> 07:00.991
(clatter)

07:00.991 --> 07:03.924
DUDE.
(door opens and slams)

07:03.924 --> 07:06.096
OKAY. I-I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
GIVING ME A SMUG LOOK,

07:06.096 --> 07:08.428
SO I'M NOT GONNA LOOK
AT YOU.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.761
COME ON. IT'S SO GOOD!

07:10.761 --> 07:11.932
NOPE.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.103
LIES!

07:13.103 --> 07:14.434
LIES!

07:14.434 --> 07:16.667
NOPE. NOPE. NO.

07:19.610 --> 07:21.011
OKAY, LOOK,

07:21.011 --> 07:22.042
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.714
BUT FIRST, YOU CAN'T DRINK WINE
ON THE COUCH.

07:23.714 --> 07:25.115
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS BOBBY'S RULE.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.047
IT'S A NEW RULE FOR EVERYONE,
EXCEPT FOR ELLIE.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.579
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN HER
DROP HER SON,

07:28.579 --> 07:31.021
BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER
DROP WINE.

07:31.021 --> 07:32.883
THANK YOU.

07:32.883 --> 07:34.154
SERIOUSLY?
WHAT IS THIS,

07:34.154 --> 07:36.827
"TURN EVERYTHING
INTO A BIG DEAL" DAY?

07:36.827 --> 07:38.489
I CAN PLAY, TOO. (chuckles)

07:38.489 --> 07:41.231
(sniffs) OH, THIS ROOM SMELLS
LIKE GUACAMOLE.

07:41.231 --> 07:44.064
(whiny voice)
I WANT TO SELL THE HOUSE!
(stomps)

07:44.064 --> 07:46.597
YOU KNOW, IT DOES SMELL
LIKE GUACAMOLE.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.599
(chuckles)
I THREW A BURRITO AT BOBBY.

07:48.599 --> 07:49.900
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.502
LOOK... (sighs)

07:51.502 --> 07:54.845
WHEN YOU LIED ABOUT BEING GREEN,
I KNOW I OVERREACTED, OKAY,

07:54.845 --> 07:56.106
BUT IT'S JUST THAT

07:56.106 --> 07:58.248
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY EX.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.581
I MEAN, VIVIAN SEEMED GREAT.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.782
THEN WE GOT MARRIED,

08:01.782 --> 08:02.913
AND THEN SHE SUDDENLY
LOST INTEREST

08:02.913 --> 08:04.785
IN EVERYTHING
I REALLY CARED ABOUT,

08:04.785 --> 08:08.789
LIKE MY BAR, HAVING KIDS,
SHAVING HER PITS.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.991
OOH. VIVIAN GOT CRUNCHY.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.262
SURE. SURE.
MM.

08:12.262 --> 08:13.694
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO
INTO MARRIAGE

08:13.694 --> 08:15.766
FEELING LIKE
I'VE BEEN TRICKED.

08:15.766 --> 08:18.268
NOW THAT I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
I CAN HANDLE IT.

08:18.268 --> 08:21.932
THERE IS NO ONE BETTER AT FIXING
RELATIONSHIPS THAN ME.

08:21.932 --> 08:23.804
MERP!
EH.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.807
REALLY? BOTH NOISES?

08:29.279 --> 08:30.941
HI, GUYS.

08:30.941 --> 08:33.744
YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS

08:33.744 --> 08:35.515
THAT I'M BETTER AT THAN YOU,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.118
LIKE READING, SPEAKING,

08:38.118 --> 08:41.121
NOT EATING A DOUGHNUT LIKE
A BEAR EATS A SALMON.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.252
(clatters)

08:42.252 --> 08:44.955
WHAT ELSE? I WROTE IT DOWN.

08:44.955 --> 08:48.559
OH. "SEX"!

08:48.559 --> 08:50.701
IT'S ON BOTH HANDS.
"SEX. SEX."

08:50.701 --> 08:53.033
(scoffs) WHATEVER, ELLIE.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.767
YOU KNOW, I GOT A LOT
OF WEIRD LOOKS

08:56.767 --> 08:59.169
WHEN I WAVED GOOD-BYE
TO STAN AT PRESCHOOL,

08:59.169 --> 09:00.741
BUT I GOTTA SAY...
(packaging rustles)

09:00.741 --> 09:03.273
WORTH IT.

09:03.273 --> 09:04.975
CAREFUL. WAITER WITH SOUP.

09:04.975 --> 09:07.878
OOH. LOOK AT YOU,
PROTECTING MY WHITE SHIRT

09:07.878 --> 09:09.920
LIKE YOU'RE SOME SORT
OF SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.981
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DID
THIS ALL DAY,

09:10.981 --> 09:12.152
I THINK I COULD WIN THIS.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.084
ALREADY CALLED IN SICK.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.856
(suspenseful music playing)

09:15.856 --> 09:16.857
GOOD GOD! ICE CREAM.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.028
WHOA!

09:18.028 --> 09:19.029
(whispers) WHOA.

09:19.029 --> 09:20.891
(sighs)
WHEW.

09:20.891 --> 09:26.036
IT WAS ROUGH LISTENING
TO ELLIE TALK TO VINCENT.

09:26.036 --> 09:27.998
I'M NOT JEALOUS.
IT'S JUST...

09:27.998 --> 09:30.801
SEXUALLY, SHE USED TO BE
SO SPONTANEOUS,

09:30.801 --> 09:32.042
AND NOW IT'S ALWAYS
THE SAME--

09:32.042 --> 09:34.705
EVERY SUNDAY AT 4:00,
SHADES DOWN, TEETH BRUSHED,

09:34.705 --> 09:36.346
HER TURN, MY TURN.

09:36.346 --> 09:38.779
(chuckles) MY TURN.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.180
WHAT? HMM.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.213
(grunts)

09:43.213 --> 09:45.756
WHAT THE HELL?
I WAS OUT OF AIR.

09:45.756 --> 09:46.757
WELL, I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW

09:46.757 --> 09:49.019
THAT I WILL ALWAYS BE
SPONTANEOUS.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.260
YOU'RE THE BEST.

09:50.260 --> 09:53.223
YOU KNOW, ELLIE USED
TO BE SO EXCITING.

09:53.223 --> 09:55.796
I NEVER THOUGHT
SHE'D LOSE THAT.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.298
OH.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.201
(strained voice) THIS DAY JUST
GETS WEIRDER AND WEIRDER.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.033
THOSE GUYS JUST SAID
THAT THEIR CHEESE STICKS

10:03.033 --> 10:05.175
GOT DELIVERED
WITH THREE MISSING.

10:05.175 --> 10:06.176
WEIRD.

10:06.176 --> 10:07.638
HMM.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.810
в™Єв™Єв™Є

10:09.810 --> 10:12.082
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
HURT IN THE PAST,

10:12.082 --> 10:14.645
SO I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN
EVERY SINGLE THING

10:14.645 --> 10:17.047
THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
NOT KNOW ABOUT ME.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.749
SHE EVEN HAD US MAKE
A LIST, TOO.

10:18.749 --> 10:21.121
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
SHE MISSED ANYTHING.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.352
SO WE'RE GONNA LAY IT
OUT HERE,

10:22.352 --> 10:24.755
AND THEN TONIGHT
YOU AND I WILL CELEBRATE

10:24.755 --> 10:28.098
AT THE "I KNOW THE CRAP OUT
OF MY FIANCEE" DINNER.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.760
I'M MAKING
ALL OF YOUR FAVORITES,

10:29.760 --> 10:31.401
EXCEPT FOR MEAT LOAF.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.203
LET'S JUST GET
THE BALL ROLLING.

10:33.203 --> 10:36.336
I ACTUALLY HATE MEAT LOAF.
IT TASTES LIKE CAT FOOD.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.009
MM. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT
UNLESS YOU'VE EATEN CAT FOOD?

10:39.009 --> 10:40.210
IT WAS A DARE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

10:40.210 --> 10:41.211
(coughs) LAST WEEK.

10:41.211 --> 10:42.743
SHUSH IT. WE'RE EASING IN.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.974
IS THAT A CHEESE STICK?

10:43.974 --> 10:47.177
LOOK, I'M AN OPEN BOOK.

10:47.177 --> 10:48.178
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH
TO TELL.

10:48.178 --> 10:51.081
EVERYTHING I SAID
I LOVE ABOUT YOU, I LOVE,

10:51.081 --> 10:54.184
BUT, OKAY, REMEMBER WHEN I WORE
THAT BASEBALL CAP FOR A WEEK?

10:54.184 --> 10:55.325
YEAH.

10:55.325 --> 10:56.927
I DIDN'T HAVE A BAD HAIRCUT.
(chuckles)

10:56.927 --> 10:59.159
I'VE GOT A LITTLE BALD SPOT
RIGHT HERE,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.962
BUT I TAKE PILLS, SO AS LONG
AS WE HAVE MEDICAL COVERAGE,

11:01.962 --> 11:03.764
YOU KNOW,
IT SHOULD BE FINE.

11:03.764 --> 11:04.965
YOU'RE BALD?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.737
OH, SHE HAS MAJOR HAIR ISSUES.

11:06.737 --> 11:08.398
ONCE A WEEK,
SHE HAS TO SHAVE HER FINGERS

11:08.398 --> 11:11.201
FROM HERE TO HERE.

11:11.201 --> 11:13.443
THOSE DAMN PILLS--
THEY GIVE ME MONKEY KNUCKLES.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.906
I JUST GOT
NEGATIVE GOOSE BUMPS.

11:15.906 --> 11:17.677
MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR NOW.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.811
I'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER.
7:30 SHARP, OKAY?

11:20.811 --> 11:23.113
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DON'T USE MY RAZOR

11:23.113 --> 11:24.254
TO SHAVE YOUR HANDS.

11:24.254 --> 11:27.157
LET'S SAVE SOME STUFF
FOR TONIGHT, OKAY?

11:27.157 --> 11:30.991
OKAY. BRING IT IN SLOW.
3 INCHES.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.993
NICE.(chuckles)

11:32.993 --> 11:34.294
(mouth full, chuckles)

11:34.294 --> 11:36.126
WELL, HOW COME YOU NEVER MADE
DINNERS LIKE THIS FOR ME

11:36.126 --> 11:37.297
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.329
I DID, BUT YOU NEVER SHOWED
BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY

11:39.329 --> 11:41.832
BANGING WAITRESSES
AT THE WAFFLE HOUSE.

11:41.832 --> 11:43.804
NOW HONESTLY,
HOW MANY TIMESDIDYOU GET

11:43.804 --> 11:45.235
SYRUP POURED IN YOUR LAP?

11:45.235 --> 11:48.008
TOO MANY. IT WAS LIKE
AN OIL SPILL DOWN THERE.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.840
YOU CAN NEVER REALLY
CLEAN IT ALL UP.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.142
WATCH THE GLASS!
WATCH THE GLASS.

11:52.142 --> 11:53.383
(lowered voice)
WATCH THE GLASS. OKAY.
IT IS SO LAME

11:53.383 --> 11:56.016
THAT YOU HAVE
A PERSONAL SHIRT PROTECTOR.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.848
NOT ME. CHECK IT.

11:57.848 --> 12:00.791
MAKING RED SAUCE
WITH NO APRON.

12:00.791 --> 12:03.854
IS SHE GONNA GO "COCKTAIL"
ON THIS BOTTLE OF OLIVE OIL?

12:03.854 --> 12:05.926
(gasps) YOU KNOW SHE IS.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.959
(gasps) OOH!
THAT'S RIGHT, CHUMPS.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.962
(dramatic orchestral music
playing)

12:11.962 --> 12:15.735
(slow motion voice) NO!

12:15.735 --> 12:18.208
(grunts)

12:18.208 --> 12:19.209
(grunts)

12:19.209 --> 12:20.811
(Andy panting)

12:20.811 --> 12:22.873
YOU TOOK A MEATBALL FOR ME.

12:22.873 --> 12:26.246
I'D TAKE A WHOLE POT ROAST
FOR YOU, SIR.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.780
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK ANDY'S
FELT SEXUALLY UNFULFILLED?

12:29.780 --> 12:32.452
KILL ME. DOES THAT ANSWER
MAKE ANY SENSE?

12:32.452 --> 12:36.987
LOOK, YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM
IN OTHER WAYS.

12:36.987 --> 12:37.988
COOKING?

12:37.988 --> 12:39.459
(chuckles) NO.
IRONING HIS SHIRTS?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.791
IS THIS THE '50s?

12:40.791 --> 12:42.392
RUBBING HIS FEET?
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

12:42.392 --> 12:44.334
RUBBING HIS BACK?
THERE'S NO RUBBING.

12:44.334 --> 12:45.335
SCRATCHING HIS BACK?

12:45.335 --> 12:46.536
MY FINGERS GET STUCK.

12:46.536 --> 12:48.098
LISTENING TO HIM?

12:48.098 --> 12:52.242
I'M NOT HIS FRIEND, TRAVIS.
I'M JUST HIS WIFE.

12:52.242 --> 12:56.476
STILL, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU KEEPING IT BETWEEN US.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.549
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I SAID
THAT I WOULD HAVE MY REVENGE?

12:59.549 --> 13:00.851
(Laurie, singsongy)
KNOCK, KNOCK.

13:00.851 --> 13:03.053
OH, NO.

13:03.053 --> 13:06.386
(imitating announcer)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

13:06.386 --> 13:08.358
WEIGHING IN AT A WEIGHT

13:08.358 --> 13:10.220
THAT A WOMAN HER HEIGHT
WOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT,

13:10.220 --> 13:17.327
THE UNDISPUTEDTRAMP-ION
OF THE WORLD--LAURIE KELLER!

13:17.327 --> 13:19.930
(exhales deeply) THIS IS REALLY
NOT THE RIGHT BRA FOR THIS.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.171
(exhales deeply)

13:21.171 --> 13:24.334
(door opens and closes)

13:24.334 --> 13:27.307
CHEW FASTER. MY ARM'S TIRED.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.408
OH.
LOOK WHO'S FINALLY HERE.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.340
OH, SORRY.

13:30.340 --> 13:33.383
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I STARTED A FIGHT THIS MORNING,

13:33.383 --> 13:36.086
BUT YOU COMING IN AND LAYING
ALL YOUR STUFF OUT ON THE TABLE

13:36.086 --> 13:38.949
MADE ME REALIZE
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,

13:38.949 --> 13:40.320
MONKEY HANDS AND ALL.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.893
IN FACT, I'M GONNA KISS
THAT THING RIGHT NOW.

13:42.893 --> 13:44.354
I'M JUST--
UGH. AAH. STUBBLE.

13:44.354 --> 13:45.395
HOW ABOUT THE LIPS?

13:45.395 --> 13:47.397
(chuckles)
OH, GOOD. FIGHT'S OVER.

13:47.397 --> 13:48.398
GET AWAY.

13:48.398 --> 13:49.359
FIGHT'S BACK ON.

13:49.359 --> 13:53.904
DINNER WAS AT 7:30.
IT'S AFTER 8:00.

13:53.904 --> 13:55.906
IS THIS HOW IT'S GONNA BE?

13:55.906 --> 13:58.438
I JUST CROSS MY FINGERS
AND HOPE YOU'LL SHOW?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.310
I THOUGHT LIVING
WITH YOU, GRAYSON,

14:00.310 --> 14:02.142
WOULD BE A BREEZE,
BUT I WAS WRONG.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.573
IT'S GONNA BE A CAKEWALK.

14:03.573 --> 14:05.175
UH, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.177
THE CHANGE WAS APPROVED,
JERK.

14:07.177 --> 14:09.249
I'M GONNA GO TAKE A LAP.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.122
(door opens)

14:12.122 --> 14:13.583
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
(door slams)

14:13.583 --> 14:15.555
LIFE JUST HAPPENED, MAN.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.327
ALL RIGHT,
YOU NEED TO WARN ME

14:17.327 --> 14:20.030
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY
BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

14:20.030 --> 14:23.033
THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR ME!

14:24.294 --> 14:26.496
I KINDA LIKE IT.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.273
I'M STILL MAD AT GRAYSON,

14:33.273 --> 14:35.946
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LOSE
MY COOL.

14:35.946 --> 14:37.407
SCREW HIM!

14:37.407 --> 14:39.249
I'LL KICK HIS ASS!

14:39.249 --> 14:42.412
(cries) I'M SO MAD, LAURIE.

14:42.412 --> 14:44.284
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.386
I LOVE HIM.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.120
(laughing)
I KNOW. WHO CARES, RIGHT?

14:50.120 --> 14:51.591
HONEY, ARE YOU P.M.S.ing?

14:51.591 --> 14:52.963
A LITTLE,

14:52.963 --> 14:55.966
AND THOSE HAIR PILLS GIVE ME
CRAZY MOOD SWINGS.

14:55.966 --> 14:58.128
OH, NO. (sighs)

15:02.072 --> 15:03.303
HEY, DUDE.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.306
WHY ARE YOU SHIRTLESS,
AND WHY ARE YOU IN MY HOUSE?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.078
WHICH QUESTION SHOULD
I ANSWER FIRST?

15:08.078 --> 15:09.609
WHY DON'T YOU KNOCK 'EM
BOTH OUT?

15:09.609 --> 15:11.381
WELL, MY SHIRT'S OFF
SO I WON'T STAIN IT,

15:11.381 --> 15:14.344
AND I'M IN YOUR HOUSE
'CAUSE I CURRENTLY LIVE HERE.

15:14.344 --> 15:16.086
TWO STRONG ANSWERS.

15:16.086 --> 15:17.617
THAT HURRICANE DID
AN EVEN WORSE NUMBER

15:17.617 --> 15:19.149
AT MY PLACE.

15:19.149 --> 15:22.552
OH, BY THE WYNONNA,
IS J-BIRD STILL ALL MAD?

15:22.552 --> 15:23.653
(sighs)

15:23.653 --> 15:26.156
YEP, ALL BECAUSE I WAS
A FEW MINUTES LATE.

15:26.156 --> 15:27.697
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT NEAR
AS BAD AS HER PULLING

15:27.697 --> 15:31.301
A FULL-ON VIVIAN AND LYING
ABOUT WHO SHE REALLY IS.

15:31.301 --> 15:33.433
IS IT COOL IF I DRINK WINE
ON THE COUCH?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.434
WELL, THERE'S A TREE
IN MY LIVING ROOM,

15:34.434 --> 15:37.037
SO GO NUTS,
AND THANKS, BY THE WAY.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.340
BECAUSE OF YOU, I CAN'T HAVE
WINE ON JULES' COUCH EITHER.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.312
MM. HOW FAIR IS THAT?

15:43.313 --> 15:45.945
YEAH, THAT ISN'T FAIR.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.017
I'M GONNA GET A GLASS.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.648
ALL RIGHT.
CAREFUL IN THE KITCHEN.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.351
THERE'S A FAMILY OF CROWS
THAT ARE LIVING IN THE OVEN,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.683
AND IT'S NOT AS FUNNY
AS IT SOUNDS.

15:53.683 --> 15:57.257
(sighs) YOU GUYS STILL BEING
BITCHES TO EACH OTHER?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.658
OH, RIGHT.
I'M REALLY GREAT AT SEX.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.330
I'M SO MUCH BETTER
THAN YOU, ELLIE.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.492
(sighs)
JELLY, YOU'RE SO SLUTTY...

16:02.492 --> 16:04.164
SLUTTY... WHATEVER.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.395
I'M GETTING
A WEIRD VIBE HERE.

16:05.395 --> 16:09.499
IT'S JUST ALL OF THIS SEX TALK
HAS REALLY MADE US BOTH...

16:09.499 --> 16:11.041
WHAT WAS THAT WORD
YOU USED?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.042
INTROSPECTIVE.

16:12.042 --> 16:15.205
RIGHT. IT HAS MADE US
BOTH REALLY...

16:15.205 --> 16:17.177
I HAD IT,
AND THEN I LOST IT.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.349
LOOK, WHEN I'M WITH A GUY,
I LIKE TO PUT ON, LIKE,

16:19.349 --> 16:21.211
A REAL SHOW, YOU KNOW?

16:21.211 --> 16:24.454
THERE'S ACROBATICS
AND COSTUME CHANGES,

16:24.454 --> 16:26.686
TEARS, IF I CAN GET THERE,

16:26.686 --> 16:28.518
BUT I DO WANT
TO GET MARRIED.

16:28.518 --> 16:31.221
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO
THE SAME CRAZY SHOW

16:31.221 --> 16:33.393
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.464
YOU KNOW, AS A WOMAN,

16:34.464 --> 16:37.367
IF YOU DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT
SEXUALLY WITH A GUY,

16:37.367 --> 16:39.769
HE'LL EXPECT IT EVERY TIME,

16:39.769 --> 16:42.232
AND, YES,
I WANT ANDY TO BE HAPPY,

16:42.232 --> 16:43.533
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
TOTALLY NAKED.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.335
I GET TOO COLD.

16:45.335 --> 16:47.707
AND I'M SORRY
IF I DON'T MOVE AROUND A LOT.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.140
I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE,
YOU KNOW?

16:50.140 --> 16:51.411
NO.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.083
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOME ADVICE,

16:53.083 --> 16:55.785
BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT
AS EXPERIENCED AS YOU'D THINK.

16:55.785 --> 16:57.117
NO ONE THINKS
YOU'RE EXPERIENCED.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.548
OH, GOOD.

16:58.548 --> 17:01.251
OKAY, IF I TRY TO HELP,
DO YOU PROMISE TO NEVER AGAIN

17:01.251 --> 17:04.254
INCLUDE ME IN ANY DISCUSSIONS
OF A SEXUAL NATURE?

17:04.254 --> 17:06.456
(both) WE PROMISE.

17:06.456 --> 17:08.728
LAURIE, STOP TRYING
SO HARD, OKAY?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.401
JUST GIVE A GUY ONE MOMENT

17:11.401 --> 17:13.403
THAT LETS HIM KNOW
IT'S ABOUT HIM.

17:13.403 --> 17:15.405
YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT
ON A BIG SHOW,

17:15.405 --> 17:17.107
UNLESS... YOU END UP
WITH A GREAT GUY

17:17.107 --> 17:19.509
WHO HAS... HEARD
ABOUT THE SHOW,

17:19.509 --> 17:22.041
AND THEN MAYBE YOU WANNA DO
JUST ONE LAST SHOW

17:22.041 --> 17:23.743
SO HE CAN SEE
WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT,

17:23.743 --> 17:25.115
BUT IF NOT--
KEEP IT MOVING.

17:25.115 --> 17:26.776
RIGHT. UH, MRS. TORRES,
YOU CAN STILL KEEP

17:26.776 --> 17:28.618
YOUR COLD-BLOODED,
BAT-LIKE NATURE.

17:28.618 --> 17:31.251
SAME ADVICE--JUST GIVE ANDY
ONE NICE MOMENT

17:31.251 --> 17:33.583
THAT LETS HIM KNOW
IT'S ABOUT HIM.

17:35.285 --> 17:37.157
(singsongy) NAILED IT.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.488
(crunches)

17:38.488 --> 17:41.161
AND THEN
PRESIDENT LINCOLN SAYS,

17:41.161 --> 17:43.493
"THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT
THESE ALIENS

17:43.493 --> 17:45.635
IS TO RESURRECT
THE DINOSAURS."

17:45.635 --> 17:48.238
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. THATWOULD
BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER.

17:48.238 --> 17:49.639
COME WITH ME.

17:49.639 --> 17:51.601
WHAT FOR?

17:51.601 --> 17:53.473
(gasps) NO WAY.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.176
HEY, COME ON!
IT'S NOT SUNDAY.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.579
DON'T GO. THIS PLACE IS CRAWLING
WITH POTENTIAL STAINS!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.582
(horror theme music playing)

18:08.258 --> 18:09.619
(high-pitched voice) OHH!

18:09.619 --> 18:12.122
CAN WE TALK? (sighs)
(panting)

18:12.122 --> 18:13.523
ALL RIGHT.

18:13.523 --> 18:17.827
I ALWAYS GIVE YOU CRAP ABOUT
WHAT A BAD HUSBAND YOU WERE.

18:17.827 --> 18:19.599
YEP. (sighs)

18:19.599 --> 18:21.371
MARRIAGE FOR ME WAS
A TOTAL CAKEWALK.

18:21.371 --> 18:23.203
OH.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.175
THANK YOU
FOR USING IT RIGHT.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.606
STILL... (sighs)

18:26.606 --> 18:29.609
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT ME
THAT MADE YOU PULL AWAY?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.840
OH, HEY. COME ON.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.742
I MEAN, IT'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

18:32.742 --> 18:35.385
GRAYSON'S ALREADY SHOWING UP
LATE FOR DINNER.

18:35.385 --> 18:36.586
I MEAN,
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

18:36.586 --> 18:38.548
HE'S GONNA BE OUT BANGING
SOME WAITRESS.

18:38.548 --> 18:39.719
(laughs) WOW.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.651
YOU GOT ALL THE WAY THERE
FROM HIM BEING 20 MINUTES LATE?

18:41.651 --> 18:44.494
I DO WHAT I DO. (sighs)

18:44.494 --> 18:48.858
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
I WASN'T SCARED AT ALL,

18:48.858 --> 18:51.861
AND NOW I'M TERRIFIED.

18:51.861 --> 18:54.564
I MEAN,
THIS ONE HAS TO WORK.

18:54.564 --> 18:55.835
(voice breaking)
I CAN'T END UP

18:55.835 --> 18:57.837
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
BEING SINGLE,

18:57.837 --> 19:01.571
TRYING TO START MY LIFE
OVER AGAIN.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.543
I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.615
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
WITH YOU AND GRAYSON?

19:05.615 --> 19:07.777
I MEAN, HE'S ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE HIS EX-WIFE,

19:07.777 --> 19:10.880
AND--AND YOU'RE NOT VIVIAN.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.582
YOU GOT MUCH BETTER BOOBS.

19:12.582 --> 19:14.554
AND A BETTER BUTT.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.256
MM... IT'S CLOSE.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.557
SHE GOT INTO YOGA.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.589
OH. WELL, I HOPE
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD,

19:19.589 --> 19:21.591
BUT FOR THE REST
OF THIS CONVERSATION,

19:21.591 --> 19:23.333
I WILL BE DOING LUNGES.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.634
(chuckles)
J-BIRD, I PROMISE,

19:24.634 --> 19:26.566
GRAYSON'S GONNA TREAT
YOU RIGHT.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.268
HE'S NOT ME.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.599
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

19:29.599 --> 19:31.471
(Motopony's "King of Diamonds"
playing)

19:31.471 --> 19:34.444
HEY, HEY, HEY.
LOOK, I WASN'T GOOD TO YOU

19:34.444 --> 19:36.446
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE,
BUT THAT'S MY BURDEN TO BEAR,

19:36.446 --> 19:39.679
NOT YOURS,
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME

19:39.679 --> 19:42.582
THAT MY MISTAKES TURNED YOU
INTO A COWARD.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.614
в™Є YOU KNOW I GOT THE OTHER 3 в™Є

19:44.614 --> 19:47.857
I TRY TOO HARD SEXUALLY.

19:47.857 --> 19:51.921
GIRLFRIEND, I JUST RAVAGED ANDY.

19:51.921 --> 19:53.893
I THINK HE REALLY LIKED IT.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.566
(raised voice)
THAT WAS SO AWESOME!

19:56.566 --> 19:58.598
SHH. WATCH YOUR TV, BOO.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.929
(chuckles)

19:59.929 --> 20:01.931
I EVEN TOOK OFF ALL MY CLOTHES.

20:01.931 --> 20:03.202
I MEAN, JUST FOR A MINUTE,

20:03.202 --> 20:04.934
AND THEN I PUT
MY SWEATSHIRT BACK ON.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.937
YOU PROMISED YOU'D STOP TALKING
TO ME ABOUT THIS STUFF.

20:07.937 --> 20:10.480
YOUR MOM'S BUSY. DEAL WITH IT.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.612
(whispers) AHH.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.214
HEY. WE'RE JUST GONNA GET
SOME WINE.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.946
CROWS TOOK MY CORKSCREW
INTO THE OVEN.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.719
IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE,
THEY GO FOR THE EYES.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.291
COME SIT WITH ME.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.622
NO WINE ON THE COUCH.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.394
THAT'S A DUMB RULE.

20:24.394 --> 20:26.696
YEAH, THAT'S A DUMB RULE
FOR EVERYONE.

20:26.696 --> 20:28.458
NOT FOR EVERYONE.

20:28.458 --> 20:31.631
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY
I FREAKED OUT.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.663
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, TOO.

20:33.663 --> 20:34.834
REALLY?

20:34.834 --> 20:39.509
YEAH. OH, MAN. I AM GREAT
AT ENDING ARGUMENTS. (chuckles)

20:39.509 --> 20:40.510
MERP!

20:40.510 --> 20:42.342
(chuckles) OHH.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.443
COME HERE.

20:44.774 --> 20:46.576
(thuds)

20:46.576 --> 20:47.817
OH, GOD!

20:47.817 --> 20:53.383
OH, YEAH!
WHITE SHIRTWINNER!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.688
WE WERE
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS,

20:58.688 --> 20:59.829
BUT THEN BOBBY POINTED OUT
THAT WE WERE PUTTING THE BAGGAGE

20:59.829 --> 21:01.861
FROM OUR PAST RELATIONSHIPS
ONTO EACH OTHER.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.393
SOMETIMES
BOBBY'S PRETTY BRILLIANT.

21:03.393 --> 21:04.434
YEAH.

21:04.434 --> 21:05.795
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:05.795 --> 21:07.867
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY,
AND I MEANEXACTLY,

21:07.867 --> 21:09.639
WHAT I SAID WOULD HAPPEN.

21:09.639 --> 21:11.471
I DON'T THINK SO. (chuckles)

21:11.471 --> 21:12.642
I-I SO DID SAY THAT,

21:12.642 --> 21:13.973
AND YOU SAID, "THAT'S DUMB,"
AND YOU SAID,

21:13.973 --> 21:15.675
UH, "SURVEY SAYS..."
(blows raspberry)

21:15.675 --> 21:17.977
I WOULD NEVER USE A NOISE
IN PLACE OF A WORD.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.610
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT
IF YOU EVER LISTENED.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.452
(thud, clatter)

21:22.452 --> 21:25.455
SORRY. I JUST HAD TO--
I HAD TO BREAK SOMETHING.

21:25.455 --> 21:29.859
SO... WHAT ELSE SHOULD WE TALK
ABOUTTODAY?
