WEBVTT

00:19.185 --> 00:20.519
Melissa and I...

00:20.521 --> 00:21.854
(whispers):
had sex.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.722
(laughs):
Good for you.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.125
I just keep thinking about
if Todd wasn't here.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.693
Todd is here.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.828
Hey, bud,
want to go for a ride?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.997
TODD:
<i>Nice try, Phil.</i>

00:31.999 --> 00:33.465
I knew you were coming back
the whole time.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
So did I.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.838
TODD: You know, one of
the positives about no people

00:39.840 --> 00:43.409
is that we get to see
the stars, huh?

00:43.411 --> 00:47.413
Todd, thank you for helping
me move my dresser upstairs.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.414
Ah, anytime, Carol.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.982
It was fun, you know?

00:49.984 --> 00:52.051
Gave me a chance to get
some one-on-one time with you.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.787
So in a way,
it was kind of a selfish move.

00:56.322 --> 00:58.190
Such a sweetie.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.025
Ooh, what's that, Melissa?

01:00.027 --> 01:04.997
Well, someone went out and
got me a charm bracelet.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.099
Was that someone's name Todd?

01:07.101 --> 01:08.634
(laughter)

01:10.236 --> 01:12.671
Did Todd get that for you or...?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.673
Yes.
I got it...
I got it for her.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.909
MELISSA:
Todd.
That's so sweet.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.877
Phil's never gotten me anything.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.512
Carol, I got you
that rash cream.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.448
I stand corrected.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.283
"Phil's never
gotten me anything."

01:24.285 --> 01:25.551
As if.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.752
Guys, I hope you don't mind

01:26.754 --> 01:28.120
giving me the floor here
for a minute.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.055
I don't know
if you know this,

01:30.057 --> 01:32.391
but in my spare time,
I like to sculpt a little bit.

01:32.393 --> 01:36.261
Anyways, I had a little time
on my hands, and, uh...

01:36.263 --> 01:38.063
I made you all this.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.565
(Carol gasps)

01:39.567 --> 01:40.766
Oh, that is so cute.
Thanks.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.669
You have a real gift, Todd.

01:45.205 --> 01:46.538
Isn't that amazing, Phil?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.440
I'm blown away.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.876
It's so frigging awesome, Todd.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.744
TODD: Thanks, buddy.
You know, I figured

01:52.746 --> 01:54.713
we'd, you know,
leave it out here...

01:56.416 --> 01:58.050
...you know, by-by the campfire.

01:58.052 --> 01:59.952
CAROL:
That's a great idea!

01:59.954 --> 02:01.787
Hey.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.622
Give me one right here.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.558
Ah. Fell for that old one.
(laughs)

02:06.560 --> 02:07.993
Such a sucker.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.896
Well, and I'd fall for it
a million times over.

02:10.898 --> 02:11.830
(gasps)

02:11.832 --> 02:13.866
You guys are so adorable.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.636
Yeah, really, really adorable.

02:18.771 --> 02:19.771
Oh! Oh, G-God!

02:19.773 --> 02:21.073
Oh, no!

02:21.075 --> 02:22.508
No!

02:22.510 --> 02:24.243
I accidentally broke
Todd's awesome sculpture.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.111
Ah, the Phil fell off.
MELISSA: It's okay.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.713
Looks like it was
a clean break.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.082
It actually looks good
without the Phil.

02:30.084 --> 02:32.784
You know what, I can...
I can totally fix that.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.752
Todd.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.987
What can't you do?

02:34.989 --> 02:35.921
Hmm?

02:35.923 --> 02:37.322
TODD:
Stop.
Nothing.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.830
Carol!

02:45.765 --> 02:46.598
Carol!

02:46.600 --> 02:47.799
What?
Oh, hey.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.168
Can I borrow your DVR?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.702
I've watched everything on mine.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.437
Okay, but this one only has
<i>Cake Bosses</i> on it.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.872
Okay, great.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.541
Spoiler alert...
Oh, no, no, I don't want to...

02:55.543 --> 02:57.609
The cake...
Don't.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.478
...won't fit in the...
Ah!

02:59.480 --> 03:00.946
You done?

03:00.948 --> 03:01.680
...van.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.348
(groans)
Yeah.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.884
I gave you so many clues
that I didn't want to hear that.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.686
I just didn't want you
to get your hopes up

03:07.688 --> 03:09.321
about getting the cake there
in one piece.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.956
Okay, I understand.
Thanks for telling me.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.192
Hey, you know,
we could commingle our DVRs

03:13.194 --> 03:14.560
if we just lived together.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.529
Carol, you know how I feel
about my space.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.165
I know, but the space
isn't really helping

03:20.167 --> 03:21.800
with our repopulation plan.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.669
I mean, look at Todd

03:23.671 --> 03:24.870
and Melissa.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.538
They've known each other
for, like,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.140
half the amount of time we have,

03:28.142 --> 03:30.142
and they're already basically
living with each other.

03:30.144 --> 03:33.045
Carol, there's a huge
difference between

03:33.047 --> 03:35.981
basically living with each other
and living with each other.

03:35.983 --> 03:40.319
Well, can you at least
fix my door, for Pete's dragon?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.688
Oh, it always comes back
to the frigging door!

03:42.690 --> 03:44.022
Forget about it, you scrub.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.891
I'll just get Todd
to do it then.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.760
Oh, God! Todd this, Todd that.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.329
"Todd's my hero."

03:50.331 --> 03:51.763
Todd?!

03:51.765 --> 03:53.732
Todd would probably do
a better job,

03:53.734 --> 03:57.002
and he would do it with a smile
on his beautiful face.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.171
Carol, I get no respect
in this community!

03:59.173 --> 04:00.739
In fact,
the whole reason I came

04:00.741 --> 04:03.709
over here in the first place
was to fix your door.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.510
I thought it was
to borrow my DVR.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.780
Yeah, borrowing your DVR is
a subset of fixing this door.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.948
Okay? See?

04:09.950 --> 04:10.949
I'm taking measurements

04:10.951 --> 04:12.084
right in front of your eyes.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.253
There we go. Got it.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.554
All right.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.389
You don't have to fix
my door, Phil.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.391
I don't? Oh, thank God.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.626
If you let me move in with you.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.095
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.230
I'm fixing this door.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.398
Okay, there we go.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.766
Off to the door store.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.636
Gonna remember this measurement.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.272
PHIL: <i>I don't know how much</i>
<i>longer I can take this whole</i>

04:33.274 --> 04:34.573
Todd lovefest!

04:34.575 --> 04:36.041
"Oh, hi, I'm Todd.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.309
"Let me kiss your ass, ladies,

04:37.311 --> 04:39.244
"and do a bunch
of nice things for you.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.712
"Oh, hi, I'm Todd.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.981
Check out this stupid
crappy sculpture I did."

04:42.983 --> 04:44.750
You guys want to see
a sculpture?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.685
This is a frigging sculpture.

04:47.553 --> 04:48.587
It's Thomas.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.055
He's perfect, right?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.491
I mean, I set up
this whole frigging community!

04:52.493 --> 04:54.726
None of them would be here
right now if it wasn't for me.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.261
And do I get any credit
for that?

04:56.263 --> 04:57.796
No, I don't.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.598
Okay, here, I got another one.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.333
It's Diego.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.268
See, Todd,
anyone can do this crap!

05:03.270 --> 05:07.506
Look, Todd cannot come in here
and steal my thunder.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.074
I mean,
I'm the frigging President

05:09.076 --> 05:11.176
of the United States of America,
for God's sake.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.744
I just wish there was some way

05:12.746 --> 05:15.414
I could remind them
of how important I am.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.416
Some grand gesture I could make.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.850
Something spectacular.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.352
It's got to be spectacular.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.521
Got to be spectacular.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.657
Come on, think, think, think.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.025
Spectacular. What's spectacular?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.094
What would really
blow them away?

05:29.096 --> 05:31.096
What's a...

05:31.098 --> 05:33.332
♪

05:42.642 --> 05:45.944
You are... frigging...
kidding me.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.347
(laughing)

05:48.349 --> 05:50.549
(mooing)

05:55.722 --> 05:58.557
In a moment, I'm gonna open
this door, and you're gonna see

05:58.559 --> 06:00.325
something that's gonna knock
your frigging socks off.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.294
I mean, this is
a game changer.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.463
It's... a game changer.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.131
I don't know how else to put it.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.866
Okay, but I have
a question.
Yeah?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.135
Is this going to change the game
in any way?

06:10.137 --> 06:12.037
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.306
Maybe this will
answer your question, okay?

06:14.308 --> 06:16.541
Bam.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.012
Wow.
I know, right?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.814
What an incredible
empty doorway.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.915
Wh-What?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.350
Wait.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.085
Wow, this is really
gonna change the game.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.755
Yeah, I mean, all I'm seeing
is a whole lot of empty space

06:29.757 --> 06:32.357
for one man
living all alone.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.658
It's sad really.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.227
Carol, now's not the time.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.362
Well, it's never the time!

06:37.364 --> 06:38.730
(cow moos)

06:40.166 --> 06:41.433
What?
Holy cow.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.535
Oh, my God!

06:43.537 --> 06:45.404
(laughs)

06:45.406 --> 06:46.872
I thought I'd never see
another animal again!

06:46.874 --> 06:47.906
Hi there, little lady.

06:47.908 --> 06:48.940
(laughs)

06:48.942 --> 06:50.942
MELISSA:
Amazing!

06:50.944 --> 06:52.677
Well, look what I did, huh?

06:52.679 --> 06:54.045
(laughter)

06:54.047 --> 06:55.714
So how do you guys
like your burgers?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.249
Ha, ha, Phil,
very funny.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.784
The lady prefers steak?

06:58.786 --> 07:00.452
Oh, you're serious?

07:00.454 --> 07:03.622
Phil, we have to keep
this cow alive for milk.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.091
Hey, we don't know how to take
care of an animal like this.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.727
I mean, this thing will be dead
in, like, three weeks.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.262
So let's just do
the humane thing

07:10.264 --> 07:12.230
and murder it now
so we can have burgers tonight.

07:12.232 --> 07:15.700
You know, Phil, I might be
able to help us out here.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.068
You've killed a cow before?

07:17.070 --> 07:19.938
No. As a kid,
I used to spend my summers

07:19.940 --> 07:21.039
on my uncle's dairy farm.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.474
So you know
how to milk it?

07:22.476 --> 07:24.910
I can get you milk,
I can churn you butter.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.546
Uh, I can get you
yogurt, cheese.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.281
Pretty much anything dairy
is at our disposal now.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.116
MELISSA:
Todd, you're the best!

07:31.118 --> 07:32.751
(laughs)

07:32.753 --> 07:34.553
I'm gonna start calling you
the milkman, milkman.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.987
(laughter)
TODD:
Carol.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.457
With all due respect
to the milkman here,

07:38.459 --> 07:40.826
who definitely deserves
all this praise

07:40.828 --> 07:42.561
for basically
just standing around,

07:42.563 --> 07:43.962
I found this thing,
so it'll be

07:43.964 --> 07:46.131
my call what happens with it.
Okay, Todd?

07:46.133 --> 07:47.432
No, no, no, no, no.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.234
Phil, just because
you found the cow

07:49.236 --> 07:51.002
doesn't give you the right
to decide what we do with it.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.104
Uh, yes, it does.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.573
Clearly you've forgotten about

07:54.575 --> 07:56.575
a little something called
finders keepers.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.676
Finders keepers?

07:57.678 --> 07:58.977
Are you five years old?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.446
And like clockwork,
the losers weep.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.849
Phil, we aren't children,
and this isn't a playground.

08:03.851 --> 08:04.883
Doy!

08:06.118 --> 08:07.319
Come on, Phil.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.421
CAROL: Yeah, this
is ridiculous!

08:09.423 --> 08:12.657
Hey, hey, I'm not trying
to fight with you here, okay?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.793
I'm just trying to tell you
what I could do

08:14.795 --> 08:16.261
if I was a selfish person.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.629
But what I will do,

08:17.631 --> 08:19.331
since I'm the ultimate
team player,

08:19.333 --> 08:23.435
is bypass FK
and let this little mother live.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.304
Phil, that's very big of you.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.374
It is a pretty big sacrifice,
especially considering

08:29.376 --> 08:32.711
someone in our midst might be
severely lactose intolerant.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.546
Are you lactose intolerant?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.517
Yes.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.318
Ah, really?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.820
But no worries, you know.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.655
Just seeing the three of you
happy is my milk.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.157
Well, aren't
you a martyr?

08:46.159 --> 08:47.959
Well, if I'm a martyr,

08:47.961 --> 08:50.328
then I guess you're also gonna
have to call Christ a martyr.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.630
TODD:
Hey, Phil, you know,

08:51.632 --> 08:53.164
I have a ton of grass
in my backyard.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.366
I'd be more than happy

08:54.368 --> 08:55.734
to keep her back
there if you want.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.002
Nice try, Todd. No.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.637
I found it;
it'll stay right here.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.006
Oh, so a barnyard animal
gets to move in with you,

09:01.008 --> 09:03.341
but, uh, not your own wife?

09:03.343 --> 09:04.910
Carol, this is perfect
for the cow!

09:04.912 --> 09:07.312
All these hard tiles
for it to hoof around on.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.713
I mean, look at her,
she loves it!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.715
Wh-Whoa, where you going, girl?!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.083
(gasps)

09:12.085 --> 09:14.419
Looks like
she's headed to Todd's.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.587
(laughs)

09:15.589 --> 09:18.123
Oh, good, good, good.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.693
Good, good, good, good.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.595
Friggin' Todd.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.031
You like that grass,
don't you, little lady? Huh?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.332
I'm sorry, Phil,

09:27.334 --> 09:28.867
should we take her
back to your place?

09:28.869 --> 09:30.869
Well, I'm sure
she prefers my foyer,

09:30.871 --> 09:32.671
but, uh, you know,
it's been a really big day.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.440
Maybe just tonight we'll, uh,
let her stay here. Sure.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.376
Okay, well,
let's get you tied up.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.078
My uncle taught
me this knot.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.046
It's called

09:41.048 --> 09:42.414
a clove hitch.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.748
Yeah, the old clove hitch.
Know it well.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.917
Oh, you do?
Everyone does.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.786
Anybody want to learn
how to milk a cow?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.688
Yes! I do!
Oh, I do!

09:49.690 --> 09:50.755
TODD: All right.
CAROL: Here you go.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.390
Here we go.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.392
So, first you grab the teat
like this.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.727
Okay?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.629
You massage the teat,

09:57.631 --> 09:59.464
and then you gently tug on it.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.933
Did you really learn that
on your uncle's farm

10:01.935 --> 10:04.569
or during your summers working
as a male prostitute? (chuckles)

10:04.571 --> 10:05.737
(Todd laughs)

10:05.739 --> 10:07.472
TODD: That's a
good one, Phil.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.874
Yeah, it is a risqué motion,
but it gets the job done.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.743
(women gasp)

10:11.745 --> 10:13.445
Milk!
We have milk!

10:13.447 --> 10:14.479
Oh, my gosh!

10:14.481 --> 10:15.714
TODD:
Anybody want a sip?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.849
Yeah, I do! Oh, my God!
I do!

10:19.719 --> 10:21.119
Mmm.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.387
It's good, isn't it?

10:22.389 --> 10:23.121
Whoa!

10:23.123 --> 10:24.656
MELISSA:
Mmm!

10:24.658 --> 10:25.890
Phil, you want a sip?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.393
Uh, God, I'm-I'm sorry, Phil.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.762
I forgot you're
lactose intolerant.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.263
Yeah, yeah.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.398
I did say that.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.666
Diagnosed lactose intolerant.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.167
Type 2, the worst type. Yeah.
Sorry.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.103
Todd, tell us
more about cows.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.170
TODD: Well, I
don't know much.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.572
I know that
they can go

10:40.574 --> 10:42.507
upstairs, but they can't
come downstairs.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.843
Oh, my Uncle Gary
was the same way.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.646
Maybe he had some
cow genes in him.
(laughs)

10:47.648 --> 10:49.648
(laughs):
Maybe.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.750
And I know you can't
milk a bull.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.251
I learned that the hard way.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.519
(laughter)

10:54.521 --> 10:55.854
A story for
another time.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.989
TODD (laughs):
Yeah.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.290
(groans loudly)

10:59.292 --> 11:00.692
Oh, God.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.193
You know, the odor
of this milk is

11:02.195 --> 11:03.662
really triggering
my intolerance.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.863
Uh, you know,
stomach really hurting here.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.598
(groans)
Okay, well,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.633
the pain is worth it when I see
the smiles on your faces.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.934
I should go,
I should go.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.370
Enjoy your milk that I found.
(groans)

11:13.272 --> 11:14.606
Anybody want a White Russian?

11:14.608 --> 11:15.974
Oh, my God.
(gasps)

11:15.976 --> 11:17.542
CAROL: Todd,
you're the best.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.010
TODD: Let's get
some more milk.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.345
CAROL:
Oh, my God.

11:31.657 --> 11:34.025
(whispering):
Okay, okay, okay.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.361
Here we go. Yes, yes, yes.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.829
(laughs)

11:37.831 --> 11:39.064
Okay.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.969
(door closes)

12:02.054 --> 12:04.189
(moans)

12:04.191 --> 12:06.925
TODD: Something about a woman
who can milk a cow.

12:07.593 --> 12:08.693
Gross, Todd.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.895
(scoffs)

12:10.897 --> 12:13.131
Frigging Todd.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.437
Uh-oh, Todd,
you big undeserving hero.

12:19.439 --> 12:24.442
Looks like your clove hitch
was not cloved enough.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.545
And now their precious milk
and cheese and yogurt

12:27.547 --> 12:29.380
is going bye-bye.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.782
And who's to blame?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.217
You.
(snickers)

12:32.219 --> 12:33.451
Come on, come on.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.053
(clicks tongue)
Come on, heel, heel.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.788
Mush, mush.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.260
I never thought I'd be so
excited about a bowl of cereal.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.262
I know.
I don't know if I can wait.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.764
Can we just go out
to the cow

12:45.766 --> 12:47.465
and milk it directly
into the bowl?
TODD: Guys!

12:47.467 --> 12:49.467
The cow's gone!

12:49.469 --> 12:51.402
What?!
It's gone!

12:51.404 --> 12:54.405
Look, I know you guys are
questioning my decision here,

12:54.407 --> 12:56.708
but this is something
I had to do.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.576
I got to reclaim this victory.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.412
And that's why I got to go
twice-baked potato on their ass.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.248
That's a weird analogy;
let me explain.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.650
You bake a potato once,
it's delicious.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.986
You bake that same
baked potato again,

13:07.988 --> 13:10.088
and-and the flavors
pop even more.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.656
It's crisper.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.259
It's just, like, an
unforgettable potato experience.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.426
But I... hey, hey, hey.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.895
Leave Trevor alone.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.263
Anyway, you know,
that's all I'm doing here.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.398
Baking this cow situation again.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.268
You know, I bring
the cow back home, again,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.069
and I'm a hero, again.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.638
You hang in there, girl.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.606
Just got to milk this
a little bit longer.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.008
Boom, I still got it.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.312
She's not back here.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.580
(groans)

13:35.582 --> 13:37.448
Hey, there, gang.
I was just in town

13:37.450 --> 13:39.083
getting this cute
straw hat for the cow.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.652
I can't wait to put it
on her furry little head.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.187
The cow's gone.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.488
Hardy har har, Carol.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.190
But seriously,
where is that cute girl?

13:45.192 --> 13:46.191
She ran away.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.525
Okay, okay.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.694
This is, uh... wow.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.129
Okay, uh...

13:51.131 --> 13:52.864
Huh, hmm... huh.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.766
What?!
TODD: I don't
know what happened.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.502
I mean, we went down there in
the middle of the night, right?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.437
And sh-she was all tied up
securely and everything.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.272
We woke up this morning,
she was just gone.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.007
I thought you said
you tied a good clove hitch.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.210
I did! I mean, I...
I-I thought I did.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.444
I'm sorry, guys.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.112
Uh, this is
all my fault.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.014
I feel like I really
let us down here.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.282
Well, this sucks!

14:11.284 --> 14:12.951
I can't go back
to cereal and water.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.186
I need cheese.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.488
Guys, look at me
and listen to me.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.624
I know we're all frustrated,
but hear this, okay?

14:19.626 --> 14:22.560
We have to fight
the very natural temptation

14:22.562 --> 14:24.562
to assign blame right now.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.497
Blaming Todd is not
gonna be productive.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.032
No one's blaming Todd.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.235
That's the spirit, Meliss, okay?

14:30.237 --> 14:33.004
And I want us to all
keep not blaming Todd.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.172
He's suffering enough

14:34.174 --> 14:35.206
right now.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.641
Because mathematically,

14:36.643 --> 14:38.743
100% of the blame
lies at his feet.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.144
Hundred percent.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.412
This is not your fault.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.681
And yet, at the same time,
it is. Hmm.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.350
But, hey, no worries.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.318
I got this.
What?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.987
I'm gonna go find
that cow, okay?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.755
So you guys just hang here
and relax, okay?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.523
Ah, Phil, l-let me help
in some way, please.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.092
Hey, hey, I got this.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.427
I found it the first time,
I can find it again.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.062
Trust me.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.431
You know exactly where
that cow is, don't you, Phil?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.700
(laughs):
What?

15:02.702 --> 15:04.068
I do not.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.169
You're lying.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.237
Where were you this morning?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.572
Where was I
this morning?!

15:07.574 --> 15:09.073
I was getting this hat
for the cow

15:09.075 --> 15:10.608
this morning
at a hat store.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.110
And that is why I'm holding it.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.279
Carol, help me out here.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.680
Don't look at me, Phil.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.782
If we lived together,
you'd have an alibi.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.384
(sighs)

15:19.386 --> 15:22.020
I had nothing to do with this.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.588
Then why don't we all go search?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.456
Let's all search?

15:26.892 --> 15:27.892
Sorry.

15:27.894 --> 15:28.927
Yeah, okay.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.795
Yeah, let's all search.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.865
So, we'll each
take a quadrant.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.700
Okay, as president,
I get first choice.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.368
No, I'll take
the first choice.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.304
But, Melissa...
Where was that
bar you showed me?

15:39.306 --> 15:41.272
Uh...

15:41.274 --> 15:43.074
Phil? Where's the bar?
Mm-hmm?

15:43.076 --> 15:45.910
Uh... the bar.
Oh, geez, uh, yeah.

15:45.912 --> 15:46.978
It's right, uh, right there.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.813
I want that one.
Oh, okay.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.882
Yeah, Phil, I'll take
this guy right here.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.918
(chuckles):
Give Phil a big open section,

15:53.920 --> 15:55.787
because he loves his space.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.923
Did you guys hear?
He won't live with his wife.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.892
MELISSA and TODD:
Yeah, we've heard.
CAROL: Yeah.

16:00.894 --> 16:02.894
Okay, so, uh, I guess
I will take this quadrant.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.630
Unless anybody else, uh,
wants to switch, Melissa?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.165
A-Anybody? Uh...

16:07.167 --> 16:08.299
No?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.500
Would you like mine?

16:09.502 --> 16:10.969
Like, I'll
trade with...

16:10.971 --> 16:12.770
No, we'll stay
with our quadrants.
Okay.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.739
Okay, so it is about 10:00 a.m.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.140
Uh, wherever that cow is,

16:16.142 --> 16:17.809
she's probably hunkered down
for the night.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.077
So best we just

16:19.079 --> 16:20.845
sit tight for now
and, uh, you know,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.613
hit it hard
first thing in the morning?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.248
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
start my search right now.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.616
Uh, okay.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

16:28.121 --> 16:31.155
(groans softly)

16:54.813 --> 16:57.348
Oh, the cow's gone.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.852
Thank God. Thank God.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.357
Where's the frigging cow?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.593
Gary! (screams)

17:12.031 --> 17:14.165
PHIL: <i>Come on, where are you,</i>
<i>you old piece of crap?</i>

17:14.167 --> 17:16.701
How the heck did you get
out of that bar?

17:20.339 --> 17:21.339
(sighs)

17:21.341 --> 17:23.408
Frigging Todd.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.742
(laughs)

17:24.744 --> 17:26.210
You found the cow!

17:26.212 --> 17:27.578
Ha!

17:27.580 --> 17:28.913
Yeah, she was just
right down the street

17:28.915 --> 17:30.381
in somebody's
front yard.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.883
Good for you, good for you.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.018
Yeah, girls are gonna be
real happy you found it.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.053
Yeah.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.354
(forced chuckle)

17:36.356 --> 17:38.256
See you back
at the... yeah.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.025
Hey, Phil.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.261
(sighs)

17:43.263 --> 17:44.862
If you don't mind,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.831
I'm gonna tell the girls
you found the cow.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.167
What?

17:49.169 --> 17:51.769
I feel bad about the way
Melissa came down on you,

17:51.771 --> 17:53.871
and I think it's the
right thing to do.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.574
Wow.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.777
Why would you want to do
something like that for me?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.847
You really don't
know, do you?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.882
Know what?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.185
Phil...

18:07.187 --> 18:09.454
you've done so
much for me.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.923
I mean, if it wasn't for those
"Alive in Tucson" billboards,

18:11.925 --> 18:13.624
I wouldn't even
be here right now.

18:13.626 --> 18:18.029
But because I am, I'm with
the woman of my dreams.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.765
I've got two great
friends in you and Carol.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.134
I've got a cow that's
gonna make me milkshakes.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.670
I'm just so
happy right now.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.639
That's all because of you, man.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.208
(chuckles softly)

18:32.644 --> 18:35.246
Thanks, Todd. I mean...

18:35.248 --> 18:38.049
I don't think I could possibly
take credit for finding that...

18:38.051 --> 18:39.150
I found the cow!

18:39.152 --> 18:40.518
Yes!

18:41.920 --> 18:43.621
TODD and MELISSA:
Mmm.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.989
(both moan)

18:44.991 --> 18:46.324
Mmm.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.259
TODD: Mmm.
(Melissa moans)

18:48.261 --> 18:49.794
Mmm.
Mmm.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.395
So good. Mmm.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.563
(Todd moans)

18:52.565 --> 18:54.332
Oh, I've heard
those sounds before.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.466
Wink, wink.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.502
(laughs)

18:58.303 --> 19:00.738
(moans dramatically)

19:00.740 --> 19:01.906
TODD:
Mmm.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.842
Hey, sorry about
flipping out earlier, Phil.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.011
Good job finding the cow.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.747
Mm, guess I just got lucky.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.716
(chuckles)

19:13.519 --> 19:15.186
Mmm!

19:15.188 --> 19:16.587
That is good.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.056
Wait, I thought you were
lactose intolerant.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.760
It's my cheat day.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.230
(Carol moans dramatically)

19:29.935 --> 19:32.170
(Carol screaming in distance)

19:34.706 --> 19:35.773
You guys hear that?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.108
Yeah.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.309
Ow! Damn it.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.677
Carol?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.345
(laughing)

19:41.347 --> 19:43.014
Oh, my God!

19:43.016 --> 19:44.482
This is priceless.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.517
(moos)
So classic.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.486
And remember, Todd said these
things don't go down stairs.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.488
So this thing's
in here forever.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.056
(laughs)
Burn.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.025
I think the burn's
more on you, Phil.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.560
What? How so?

19:55.562 --> 19:57.528
I'm not bunking down with a cow.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.996
Big news, everyone.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.799
I'm finally moving in
with my husband.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.701
Burn.
No, but-but...

20:03.703 --> 20:05.136
Uh... (stammers)

20:05.138 --> 20:06.904
And just think,
this could have all been avoided

20:06.906 --> 20:09.373
if you'd fixed my gol-dang door.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.108
(Carol laughing)

20:19.084 --> 20:21.552
Isn't this great?

20:21.554 --> 20:24.755
The best.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.825
So what exactly happened again
with the cow?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.894
It was a double
clove hitch knot.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.562
I don't know.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.166
It's one of those
freak happenings, you know?

20:35.168 --> 20:39.103
Here, I'll tell you
exactly how it went down.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.038
I couldn't sleep.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.908
<i>So I went downstairs,</i>
<i>and I got myself a snack.</i>

20:43.910 --> 20:46.711
<i>And then I went</i>
<i>to the living room,</i>

20:46.713 --> 20:49.013
<i>and I reread a</i> Twilight.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.782
<i>Then I did some knitting.</i>

20:51.784 --> 20:54.885
<i>Then I got drowsy,</i>
<i>so I walked back upstairs,</i>

20:54.887 --> 20:58.556
<i>and I got into bed,</i>
<i>and then I fell asleep.</i>

20:58.558 --> 21:01.292
<i>And I woke up, and there was</i>
<i>a cow in my face.</i>
<i>(screams)</i>

21:03.128 --> 21:05.896
And that's exactly
what happened.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.298
Really?

21:07.300 --> 21:10.534
Hey, it all worked out
for the best, right?

21:10.536 --> 21:13.104
Yep.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.773
Good night,
Mr. President.
Good night.
