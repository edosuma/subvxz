Difficult for you, not for me.

45:53.426 --> 45:57.091
Do not worry.
I can help you, buddy. Sir.

45:57.305 --> 46:01.634
That's why you're here, boy.
You will help us to find the madman.

Rather, the Invisible Man.

01:02:03.183 --> 01:02:07.680
I have even removed
voting register.

01:02:07.855 --> 01:02:10.690
I do not exist.

01:02:10.816 --> 01:02:16.689
So, Mr. AP... In order to purchase
-

01:02:16.864 --> 01:02:23.579
heksogeenipommiin materials need not be Teräsmies.

01:02:23.788 --> 01:02:27.786
It manages the invisible man.
Take a look at the internet.

01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:32.746
Hundreds of pages will guide in making bombs.

01:02:32.964 --> 01:02:36.914
Do not ask me how, ask us why!

01:02:37.135 --> 01:02:42.510
Why? Focus on the present moment,
Mr. AP.

01:02:44.184 --> 01:02:50.021
One of the cockroach still have to whack.
Then tell you where the bombs are.

01:02:50.232 --> 01:02:57.065
If we do not kill Majoodia,
you are going to blow up the bombs.

01:02:57.281 --> 01:02:59.819
You're killing innocent people.

01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:05.823
Right. If he is released, he will kill thousands of
.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.418
I ask only one person.
He ​​would have to death.

01:03:10.628 --> 01:03:14.757
Compare the alternatives.
This is a good bargain.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:19.338
Why are these four
so many terrorists?

01:03:19.554 --> 01:03:23.220
These four held a lottery happiness.

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:32.139
Do not you dare to tell your name?
- Do not worry about it.

01:03:32.359 --> 01:03:37.734
You should have to destroy these creatures
after the attacks.

01:03:37.907 --> 01:03:40.908
Sessions were several
but did not do anything.

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:46.789
Causes of terrorism does not matter.
The same place where they are from.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.501
Causes need to be addressed, but not
at the expense of innocent lives.

01:03:54.382 --> 01:03:57.419
They hit the train station.

01:03:57.636 --> 01:04:02.013
We cried a couple of days.
Then they hit the holy city.

01:04:02.224 --> 01:04:05.723
Then to the airport.
How many were killed? Have you already forgotten?

01:04:05.894 --> 01:04:09.678
Forgetting is a national sicknesses.

01:04:09.857 --> 01:04:14.400
Terrorism must be destroyed.

01:04:14.612 --> 01:04:19.819
A quick right.
- Why not? Terrorism is urgent.

01:04:20.034 --> 01:04:24.495
If we wait, it just evolves.
New names, new shapes.

01:04:24.705 --> 01:04:27.742
The core remains the same. Terrorism.

01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:33.872
You want to destroy terrorism but to terrorize us!

01:04:35.508 --> 01:04:38.296
What religion you belong to?

01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:42.723
Religion? There is...

01:04:42.891 --> 01:04:46.759
This is not about religion.

01:04:46.937 --> 01:04:52.940
Gopinath was a Hindu. Murderer.
I killed him. So am I a Muslim?

01:04:53.152 --> 01:04:57.150
Sarath Master, a Buddhist.
Thousands killer. I killed him.

01:04:57.364 --> 01:04:59.690
Does that make me a Christian?

01:04:59.867 --> 01:05:05.241
You may argue religions attributed
unsuspecting people.

01:05:05.456 --> 01:05:07.947
It is up to you.

01:05:08.167 --> 01:05:13.328
You can push out the lies on TV
and brainwash the gullible.

01:05:13.548 --> 01:05:16.668
Do not join together by me to any group.

01:05:16.843 --> 01:05:21.920
I am an ordinary citizen,
which went into action.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:27.383
Maybe I'm just a Christian or a Buddhist.
Communist or an atheist.

01:05:27.604 --> 01:05:30.771
Do not we have the right to get angry?

01:05:30.983 --> 01:05:34.186
Right to say that enough is enough.

01:05:34.403 --> 01:05:37.902
This is not about race, religion or politics,
.

01:05:38.115 --> 01:05:41.484
You'll need to know
that the people will be angry.

01:05:41.702 --> 01:05:44.620
Do not tempt the patience.

01:05:45.831 --> 01:05:50.410
I do not know what you're trying to prove,
but you will not succeed.

01:05:50.628 --> 01:05:53.748
I'll find you.

01:05:53.965 --> 01:06:00.134
I have already succeeded, Mr. AP.
I got your attention.

01:06:00.346 --> 01:06:02.920
Tell me something.

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:09.474
Someone close to you he dead in bomb attacks?

01:06:09.689 --> 01:06:14.186
Why should I wait
that anyone close die?

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:22.451
I'll tell you one thing.

01:06:22.661 --> 01:06:25.532
There was someone on the train.

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:30.790
Approximately twenty-something man.
I do not know his name.

01:06:31.003 --> 01:06:34.669
He always greeted me with a,
when the boarded the train.

01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:37.758
I salute him.

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:41.462
We did not know each other's names.

01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:45.050
We said only "hello" to each other.

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:50.638
He showed me the engagement rings
previous day.

01:06:50.816 --> 01:06:53.817
He was happy.

01:06:54.027 --> 01:06:58.191
The next day
missed the train, and I cheated death.

01:06:58.407 --> 01:07:01.443
He did not.

01:07:04.997 --> 01:07:09.209
After the train was no longer the familiar words.

01:07:09.418 --> 01:07:12.585
Wagons full of the unknown.

01:07:20.805 --> 01:07:25.348
What does it matter who I am?

01:07:27.729 --> 01:07:32.771
When you leave home,
may not be able to return.

01:07:32.943 --> 01:07:37.771
When the children go to school,
not be able to see them ever again.

01:07:38.615 --> 01:07:43.361
Akthul, Gopinath and Sarath
may be a crossroads -

01:07:43.579 --> 01:07:48.490
bomb.
He ​​will blow your dreams.

01:07:50.085 --> 01:07:52.956
They kill anyone.

01:07:54.465 --> 01:07:59.044
Terrorism must be crushed as soon as it starts.

01:07:59.262 --> 01:08:02.797
You behave like a crazy terrorist.

01:08:03.016 --> 01:08:05.767
Let me explain.

01:08:05.977 --> 01:08:11.351
If they killed 300 - 400 people -

01:08:11.566 --> 01:08:14.900
you expect the court.

01:08:15.111 --> 01:08:21.031
I'll kill four terrorists,
and you are panicking.

01:08:21.243 --> 01:08:23.734
I do not blame you.

01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:28.538
You decided that we need to
wait for court action.

01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:31.122
Too little, too late.

01:08:32.296 --> 01:08:36.127
Am I crazy?
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

01:08:36.341 --> 01:08:41.549
Three bombs explode at exactly six.

01:08:41.764 --> 01:08:44.386
The clock is ticking. You run out of time.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.761
Officer Mohideen,
you decide whether this is the last call.

01:08:49.981 --> 01:08:54.975
Supplier Thenuwara
arrives there in ten minutes.

01:08:55.194 --> 01:08:59.406
He may look like on TV,
that Akthul Majood is dead.

01:08:59.616 --> 01:09:02.533
You know what is at stake.

01:09:02.743 --> 01:09:06.872
Then I'll tell where the bombs are.

01:09:10.711 --> 01:09:13.416
Deputy Chief.

01:09:14.256 --> 01:09:18.124
The situation is not under control.

01:09:18.344 --> 01:09:21.261
Should I call the Prime Minister?

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:27.341
This will be the consequences.

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:32.354
It's too late to worry about it.
Sir.

01:09:32.567 --> 01:09:35.687
What if something goes wrong?

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:43.696
Right.
These are going to a funeral.

01:09:46.665 --> 01:09:50.247
I have been here since the beginning.

01:09:50.461 --> 01:09:54.921
The feeling is mutual.
Forgot your cell phone.

01:09:55.132 --> 01:09:58.169
Take it for him, Victor.
Wipe it.

01:09:58.385 --> 01:10:02.134
Prime Minister's hands must remain clean.

01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:07.098
Hello.
- Where are you?

01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:13.065
At the airport. What blew up?
- It'll be fine.

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:16.894
Go next to the runway.
- Okay. Let's go!

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:21.241
Mohideen, remember that you are a police officer.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:24.452
Sir!
- Mohideen? Can you hear me?

01:10:24.663 --> 01:10:27.415
Sir!
- Mohideen?

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:30.376
Hello! Sir!

01:10:36.175 --> 01:10:39.923
Ranjan ! Ranjan, do not do it!

01:10:44.517 --> 01:10:49.226
Ranjan, no!
We have to take him back.

01:10:49.438 --> 01:10:51.645
No!

01:10:53.651 --> 01:10:56.937
Ranjan! Do not do it!

01:10:57.155 --> 01:11:02.280
Ranjan, stop it!
I will not let you do that.

01:11:49.584 --> 01:11:56.121
Terrorist trying to escape
Jayaweera and Mohideen work.

01:11:56.341 --> 01:11:59.710
The prisoners were transferred for security reasons.

01:11:59.887 --> 01:12:04.134
During the transfer, they were able to free
and hijacked the aircraft.

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:08.561
Officer Jayaweera and I
to stop them.

01:12:08.771 --> 01:12:14.014
The prisoner tried to escape.
We had to shoot him.

01:12:15.945 --> 01:12:19.813
Oh, my God!
- Thank you, Mr. AP.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:26.074
It was a pleasure to work with.
- Where the hell are the bombs?

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:32.000
This is a live broadcast of the Katukurundasta.

01:12:32.212 --> 01:12:37.088
The terrorists tried to escape.
All four were killed.

01:12:37.843 --> 01:12:41.793
Why they were brought here?
Where they were going to go?

01:12:45.976 --> 01:12:50.104
Miss Dilky,
I have news for you.

01:12:50.314 --> 01:12:55.142
Dilky, Dilky? Can you hear me?
- Yes.

01:12:55.361 --> 01:12:58.944
I live on.
- I know Dilky.

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:01.695
I know that you are describing.

01:13:01.868 --> 01:13:06.446
Tell the viewers,
where the other three are the bomb.

01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:11.789
Listen carefully, I will say this only once
. Three bombs.

01:13:11.962 --> 01:13:16.090
Bus. Pettah Matthegodaan.

01:13:18.218 --> 01:13:20.507
Number 32

01:13:20.721 --> 01:13:25.347
Train. At seven o'clock train Galle.

01:13:26.226 --> 01:13:31.185
Mall. O'Dells, 1 layer.

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:37.441
None of them explode.

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:42.700
Take care of yourself, Dilky.

01:13:42.869 --> 01:13:45.276
Thank you.

01:13:51.711 --> 01:13:54.249
Officer Mohideen!

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:59.256
Stay tuned. Dilky Thenuwara
Katukurundan Airport.

01:14:20.658 --> 01:14:25.865
What is this?
The train is stopped.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.283
Call me back then.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.038
Do not worry about it.

01:14:32.253 --> 01:14:36.121
Are you ready?
I need an image quickly!

01:14:36.883 --> 01:14:39.837
This does not work, sir.

01:14:40.053 --> 01:14:44.051
How so?
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:14:46.393 --> 01:14:50.972
What is that building?
Is he in there?

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.941
What happened?

01:14:54.151 --> 01:14:57.816
You said that you are able to do this.

01:15:00.407 --> 01:15:05.283
Can not you find him
whether or not you want to find?

01:15:16.508 --> 01:15:21.668
Am I the only one who wants to capture the
of the man?

01:15:41.367 --> 01:15:43.774
I understand.

01:15:53.129 --> 01:15:55.834
I understand.

01:18:48.645 --> 01:18:52.689
What time is it?
My watch has stopped.

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:06.948
Have you been shopping?

01:19:27.018 --> 01:19:31.146
Did you get everything you asked for?

01:19:32.607 --> 01:19:35.691
Why are not you answering?

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.731
Are you on your way home?
- Yes.

01:19:38.905 --> 01:19:41.859
I can not hear you.

01:19:46.288 --> 01:19:50.202
Yes, honey. I'm on my way home.

01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:08.723
My name is Morris Da Silva.
