This is Principal Lewis.

00:34.678 --> 00:37.523
I need Steve Smith to come
to my office at once.

00:37.648 --> 00:39.373
Ooh.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.361
Steve, we said we were
gonna be good this year.

00:42.486 --> 00:44.296
We're co-presidents
of the Good Boy Club.

Sure. I got it right here.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.755
Wha-bam.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.105
Oh, dear.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.449
I'll handle this, Jared.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.833
Wha-bam!

01:13.958 --> 01:15.784
That was pretty hilarious, buddy.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.003
I swear, it's like
they're dating now.

01:18.128 --> 01:21.248
They don't pay me enough
to give a damn about that.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.508
Here's the account info
I was telling you about.

01:23.633 --> 01:24.977
My credit's a mess.

01:25.102 --> 01:26.345
I'm in overdraft hell,

01:26.470 --> 01:28.247
and now the bank's telling
me my debit card...

01:28.372 --> 01:30.549
Bri, Bri.
Relax. I got it.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.927
Clara, could you make me
a nice hot chocolate?

01:35.303 --> 01:36.321
Clara,

01:36.446 --> 01:38.523
did you you roll your
god-dang eyes at him?

01:38.648 --> 01:40.659
Woman, I will make you
teach summer school.

01:40.784 --> 01:42.436
I will steal your summer.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.899
First, we move you to a credit union.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.901
Better interest rates.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.202
Ech!

01:50.327 --> 01:52.571
That's how you lose a summer, bitch.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.724
Oh, God. We've gone
to a million of those.

02:12.849 --> 02:14.217
Why don't I go in your place?

02:14.383 --> 02:15.727
Oh, thanks, Roger,
but you have to be a parent

02:15.852 --> 02:16.887
to go to these things.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.264
Or a legal guardian.

02:18.389 --> 02:21.000
All you'd have to do is sign
a few papers and la-la,

02:21.125 --> 02:22.634
I'm responsible for Steve.

02:22.759 --> 02:23.936
Roger, couple things.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.605
I think you meant to say
"viola," instead of "la-la. "

02:26.730 --> 02:27.840
I did.

02:27.965 --> 02:29.875
And we'd be terrible parents

02:30.000 --> 02:32.077
if we gave you any
authority over Steve.

02:32.202 --> 02:33.745
Hey, I'm a great caregiver.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.281
I promise, if you
make me his guardian,

02:35.406 --> 02:36.490
I won't let you down.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.116
How are we supposed to believe that?

02:38.407 --> 02:41.495
Behold.
Roger Smith, caregiver.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.222
Here's me burping a baby.

02:43.347 --> 02:44.723
Here's me cultivating a garden.

02:44.848 --> 02:46.558
Lush.

02:46.683 --> 02:48.393
Here's me shaving a homeless.

02:48.518 --> 02:50.462
Shaved him clean, bow to stern.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.497
Smooth as a dolphin.

02:52.622 --> 02:53.823
Impressive.

02:55.059 --> 02:56.702
And take a look at the
satisfaction survey

02:56.827 --> 02:58.603
Klaus filled out after
I took care of him

02:58.728 --> 03:00.505
the week you all went to
Michael Jackson's funeral.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.241
♪ Hee-hee! ♪

03:02.366 --> 03:05.110
You'll notice Klaus rated me
a five in every category.

03:05.235 --> 03:07.854
I wrestled with that
questionnaire for days.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.614
At one point, I convinced myself

03:09.739 --> 03:12.451
Roger's performance
in "courtesy" merited a four.

03:12.576 --> 03:16.155
As the pen hit the paper,
I knew instantly, I was a liar.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.025
I quickly circled the five,
but that slight mark remains.

03:20.150 --> 03:24.538
And it torments me
every day of my life!

03:24.704 --> 03:25.697
Whoa.

03:25.822 --> 03:27.499
See, I don't have children of my own.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.435
It's hole in my heart I
desperately yearn to fill.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.804
Making me Steve's guardian
would be the greatest gift

03:32.929 --> 03:34.256
you guys could ever give me.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.009
I guess we could let him do
"Coffee with the Principal"

03:37.134 --> 03:40.212
just as a trial run, and
if that doesn't work out,

03:40.337 --> 03:41.881
we yank his privileges.

03:42.006 --> 03:44.641
You just got me seriously horny.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.386
Okay, Roger, we'll make you
Steve's legal guardian.

03:47.511 --> 03:48.820
Really? Oh, my God!

03:48.945 --> 03:49.989
Thank you!

03:50.114 --> 03:51.257
Whoa, watch out.

03:51.382 --> 03:52.391
Was that a...

03:52.516 --> 03:53.558
No.

03:53.683 --> 03:55.094
Stan. Go on.

03:55.219 --> 03:57.863
Go take care of that.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.865
I got this one.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.508
Hey, bud. You hear the great news?

04:04.633 --> 04:05.677
What?

04:05.802 --> 04:07.578
You folks made me
your legal guardian.

04:07.703 --> 04:09.881
I'm going to "Coffee with the
Principal" in their place.

04:10.006 --> 04:11.983
Whatever. Say hi to Brian for me.

04:12.108 --> 04:14.185
You mean Principal Brian Lewis?

04:14.310 --> 04:15.787
Yeah, me and him are amigos.

04:15.912 --> 04:17.353
I'm texting his ass now.

04:17.478 --> 04:18.822
Colorful language.

04:18.947 --> 04:21.024
Phfft! Shut up, Roger.
I'll see you later.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.593
I'll be home after your bedtime.

04:22.718 --> 04:24.361
Pancakes tomorrow sound good?

04:24.486 --> 04:26.064
Whatever, douche.
Shut the door.

04:26.189 --> 04:27.392
Of course.
Sleep tight.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.027
Gay!

04:30.936 --> 04:32.837
Welcome. Tonight you'll be learning

04:32.962 --> 04:34.983
about your child's
scholastic routine.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.574
Any questions are always welcome.

04:36.699 --> 04:39.411
If you're just here to tell me
I'm doing a great job,

04:39.536 --> 04:40.655
that's fine, too.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.782
I have a question.

04:43.907 --> 04:46.017
Roger Smith.
Legal guardian for Steve Smith.

04:46.142 --> 04:47.552
Principal Lewis, I've noticed

04:47.677 --> 04:50.422
that my Steve has not been doing
well on the state-wide tests.

04:50.547 --> 04:51.708
Why would that be?

04:51.874 --> 04:54.252
Well, some children
aren't good test-takers.

04:54.418 --> 04:55.894
Steven's a genius!

04:56.019 --> 04:57.796
Maybe, instead
of a new football stadium,

04:57.921 --> 04:59.799
you could have put that money
toward your students.

04:59.965 --> 05:01.165
Uh-oh.
He's getting it good.

05:01.290 --> 05:02.333
Oh, damn.

05:02.458 --> 05:03.678
Um, who are you?

05:03.844 --> 05:05.102
I know who you are.

05:05.227 --> 05:08.306
Principal Library Book, because
you're obviously checked out!

05:08.431 --> 05:09.809
Ooh!

05:13.437 --> 05:15.313
Brian just called me!

05:15.438 --> 05:17.817
He said you were a jerk during
"Coffee with the Principal"!

05:17.983 --> 05:19.784
Look, me and him...

05:19.909 --> 05:20.952
He and I...

05:21.077 --> 05:22.821
We have a good thing
going at that school.

05:22.946 --> 05:24.322
Don't mess it up.

05:24.447 --> 05:25.824
Mess it... I'm trying to help you.

05:25.949 --> 05:28.259
I stopped by your classes and
got your homework for next week.

05:28.384 --> 05:29.928
Why don't you get a jump on it?

05:30.053 --> 05:31.887
I'm going to bed, Roger.
I'm tired.

05:32.889 --> 05:34.098
Not anymore, you're not.

05:34.223 --> 05:35.700
That'll keep you wired
for a couple hours.

05:35.825 --> 05:36.801
What is that?

05:36.926 --> 05:38.035
For you, it's a study aide.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.714
I use it to go dancing.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.442
Well, look who's up before noon.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.310
Just wanted to make
a little lunch for Steve.

05:46.435 --> 05:47.645
That was thoughtful.

05:47.770 --> 05:49.647
How was "Coffee with the Principal"?

05:49.772 --> 05:51.850
He made a scene!
He told Principal Lewis

05:51.975 --> 05:53.384
I should be getting better grades,

05:53.509 --> 05:56.220
then he went to my classes,
got a week's worth of homework,

05:56.345 --> 05:57.941
and made me study till midnight.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.317
That sounds fantastic.

05:59.483 --> 06:00.959
Here, take your lunch.
No time to dilly.

06:01.084 --> 06:02.360
The bus is running
three minutes early.

06:02.485 --> 06:03.655
Go, go, go, go, go.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.264
Wow. Roger really seems
to be on top of things.

06:07.389 --> 06:08.600
There's a school bus?

06:08.725 --> 06:11.135
I'm surprised how
good he is with Steve.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.471
Oh, man. Do you know what this means?

06:13.596 --> 06:15.907
If Roger can take care of Steve,

06:16.032 --> 06:18.275
we can finally go on
that kids-free vacation

06:18.400 --> 06:19.911
we've been talking about
the last ten years.

06:20.036 --> 06:21.278
You mean,

06:21.403 --> 06:23.114
the dream vacation?

06:23.239 --> 06:25.176
Five days and four nights at...

06:25.342 --> 06:27.284
Flash Flood Acres!

06:27.409 --> 06:30.955
The largest water park
in the universe!

06:31.080 --> 06:33.048
Dan, where are the kids?

06:34.751 --> 06:36.327
How many beers have you had?

06:36.452 --> 06:38.162
Just one.

06:38.287 --> 06:45.947
But it was the largest beer
in the universe!

06:46.113 --> 06:48.706
Hey. I want to apologize
for my legal guardian.

06:48.831 --> 06:50.608
I had a talk with him.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.078
He won't bother you again.

06:52.244 --> 06:53.778
He's a funny little guy, isn't he?

06:53.903 --> 06:55.613
Made me really nervous.

06:55.738 --> 06:57.882
Hey, could you turn
it to channel four?

06:58.007 --> 06:59.502
<i>They're dog a Galactica marathon.</i>

06:59.668 --> 07:02.172
Principal Lewis,
we're watching something.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.132
I'm going to hatchet
you, Bob Crawley!

07:04.298 --> 07:06.092
It-It's cool, Brian.

07:10.687 --> 07:11.829
Oh, my bank again.

07:11.954 --> 07:12.964
Don't worry about e bank.

07:13.089 --> 07:15.033
I just have one last
set of forms to file,

07:15.158 --> 07:16.811
and when that's done, you're golden.

07:16.977 --> 07:18.269
Everybody, freeze.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.538
Registered legal guardian,
Commonwealth of Virginia.

07:20.663 --> 07:22.817
Oh, damn it.
Toss your weed.

07:22.983 --> 07:24.402
Superintendent?

07:24.568 --> 07:25.877
It's come to my attention

07:26.002 --> 07:28.145
you've been letting one
of your students skip classes,

07:28.270 --> 07:30.784
miss tests, and hang out
in the teachers' lounge.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.550
I'm sorry, Brian, this is bad.

07:32.675 --> 07:34.018
I hate to say it, but...

07:34.143 --> 07:35.286
You're fired!

07:35.411 --> 07:37.188
Is that what you intended
to say, superintendent?

07:37.313 --> 07:39.457
That's what I super-intended to say.

07:39.582 --> 07:41.583
Yay!

07:49.280 --> 07:51.425
Is that too much air?

07:51.550 --> 07:53.760
You want some radio?

07:53.885 --> 07:55.629
I just want what's
best for you, Steve.

07:55.754 --> 07:57.364
You've got a funny way of showing it!

07:57.489 --> 07:58.728
Geez, you scared me.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.980
You said nothing for so
long, and then you yelled.

08:01.146 --> 08:03.608
I can't believe you got one
of my best friends fired!

08:03.774 --> 08:05.372
Friends?! He's using you.

08:05.497 --> 08:07.529
I will not let him
ruin your education.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.675
Brian.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.577
BRIAN:
So, that was weird today.

08:10.702 --> 08:11.745
We'll get your job back.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.179
And-And don't worry about the bank.

08:13.304 --> 08:14.681
I got your forms right here.

08:14.806 --> 08:16.412
Oh, no you don't.
Roger!

08:16.578 --> 08:17.651
Lewis, this is Roger Smith.

08:17.776 --> 08:19.707
I need you to stop calling my boy.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.321
What are you doing?

08:21.446 --> 08:23.757
Steve, your relationship
with him is inappropriate.

08:23.882 --> 08:25.359
He-He could be a sexual predator

08:25.484 --> 08:27.361
who wants to make
you his next victim.

08:27.486 --> 08:30.196
It happened to me once.
The guy was a monster.

08:30.321 --> 08:33.332
He just wrote something really
funny on my Facebook wall.

08:33.457 --> 08:35.235
That's how he gets me.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.169
He's witty.

08:37.294 --> 08:39.434
It's Alan Rickman.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.544
Uh, no.

08:44.669 --> 08:46.303
Oh, no.

08:49.541 --> 08:52.151
Brian, I'm throwing your ass
out for not paying rent.

08:52.276 --> 08:53.553
Look, I'm going to pay.

08:53.678 --> 08:55.955
I've got one of my students
working on my finances.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.023
A student?

08:57.148 --> 08:58.191
Well, a former student.

08:58.316 --> 08:59.860
I've just been fired.

08:59.985 --> 09:03.062
You lost your job and you've got
a teenager handling your money?

09:03.187 --> 09:04.931
Yes, but it's not that much money.

09:05.056 --> 09:06.633
Oh...

09:06.758 --> 09:08.423
Checkmate.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.351
Where's your butt buddy now?

09:25.476 --> 09:27.511
Here, let me get you
some hot chocolate.

09:28.847 --> 09:31.958
<i>Keep it down! There's a
Galactica marathon on.</i>

09:32.083 --> 09:33.192
Keep it down.

09:33.317 --> 09:35.128
Keep it down. Keep it down.

09:35.253 --> 09:37.196
Keep it down.
Keep it down.

09:37.321 --> 09:39.829
I'm not saying anything!

09:43.662 --> 09:45.639
I can't believe
we get a whole week here

09:45.764 --> 09:46.873
withouthe kids.

09:46.998 --> 09:48.241
This is why I had children,

09:48.366 --> 09:50.423
so one day, I wouldn't
have to be around them.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.986
Is that it?

10:00.111 --> 10:01.922
We've done everything
on the map twice.

10:02.047 --> 10:04.390
But this is the biggest
water park in the world.

10:04.515 --> 10:05.959
We can't be done already.

10:06.084 --> 10:08.895
Let's see- 50 slides,
each about a minute long;

10:09.020 --> 10:10.096
we didn't wait in any lines;

10:10.221 --> 10:11.498
we ran everywhere-

10:11.623 --> 10:12.699
yeah, less than two hours.

10:12.824 --> 10:14.133
Damn it.

10:14.258 --> 10:17.170
All right, well...
we could use this orange key

10:17.295 --> 10:19.262
to check on our sneakers.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.181
Roger?

10:28.460 --> 10:31.381
He's home. Just making
your after-school snack.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.758
Thought you might like some... No!

10:33.924 --> 10:36.790
No! Oh, God!

10:36.915 --> 10:39.493
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

10:39.618 --> 10:40.660
Roger-

10:40.785 --> 10:42.161
My baby!

10:42.286 --> 10:44.364
What happened to you?
Who did this?

10:44.489 --> 10:47.133
Who did this to my baby?

10:47.258 --> 10:49.669
The teachers.

10:49.794 --> 10:52.839
They made a circle and they hit me.

10:52.964 --> 10:55.238
Oh, God!

11:07.879 --> 11:10.524
I don't think I can
go back to school.

11:10.649 --> 11:12.692
Oh, Steve, you will never, ever

11:12.817 --> 11:15.395
have to worry
about those teachers again.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.563
See you later, guys.

11:16.688 --> 11:17.764
Have a good one.

11:17.889 --> 11:18.689
See you tomorrow.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.780
<i>Naranjas. Naranjas.</i>

11:33.905 --> 11:36.362
Give me that fruit.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.521
How much?

11:41.646 --> 11:43.890
Ten bucks to see it,
20 bucks to ride it.

11:44.015 --> 11:45.291
No. I meant for the oranges.

11:45.416 --> 11:47.260
Not for sale, bitch.

11:47.385 --> 11:49.386
All right, I'll see it.

11:51.084 --> 11:52.131
What are you doing?

11:52.256 --> 11:53.600
Showing you my butt.

11:53.725 --> 11:56.302
What? You thought
those were ding-dong prices?

11:56.427 --> 11:59.218
Nah, nah, nah.

12:01.094 --> 12:03.139
Brian, are you in there?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.302
Oh, no.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.650
Don't ever run off like that!

12:10.775 --> 12:12.251
You scared me half to death!

12:12.376 --> 12:13.649
They evicted Brian.

12:13.815 --> 12:16.152
That's what he deserves
for messing with your education.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.657
He was my friend.

12:17.782 --> 12:19.960
I got you a new friend- Freddy.

12:20.085 --> 12:22.328
He likes to drink milk
and play games.

12:22.453 --> 12:23.396
Hello.

12:23.521 --> 12:24.664
These are new shorts.

12:24.789 --> 12:26.466
You're taller than me.

12:26.591 --> 12:28.664
Freddy!

12:31.333 --> 12:33.740
Hi. We would like a refund
for eight day-passes.

12:33.865 --> 12:36.142
We overestimated
how long we'd want to be here.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.911
You have to talk to the manager.

12:38.036 --> 12:39.378
He's not back till Thursday.

12:39.503 --> 12:41.147
I'm sorry, sir.

12:41.272 --> 12:43.449
I really wish there was
something I could do.

12:43.574 --> 12:45.785
This guy is the year.

12:45.910 --> 12:47.053
Come on, Francine.

12:47.178 --> 12:49.179
Let's take another run
at Splash Canyon.

12:54.886 --> 12:55.962
(tone ringing)

12:56.087 --> 12:57.193
Hello?

12:57.359 --> 12:58.898
Dad, you guys have to come home.

12:59.023 --> 13:01.101
Roger got Principal Lewis fired,
and now he's trying

13:01.226 --> 13:03.866
to make me hang out with
this nerdy kid named Freddy.

13:04.032 --> 13:06.239
Son, your mother
and I are on vacation.

13:06.364 --> 13:07.674
Steve, it's your mom.

13:07.799 --> 13:10.844
Frankly, I'm glad Roger
got Principal Lewis fired.

13:10.969 --> 13:13.212
Your friendship with
him was getting weird.

13:13.337 --> 13:14.914
I wanted to say something about it,

13:15.039 --> 13:16.850
but I was scared you might tell me

13:16.975 --> 13:18.217
that you two were lovers.

13:18.342 --> 13:20.020
Now stop complaining and go to sleep.

13:20.145 --> 13:22.112
Should be bedtime back there.

13:26.885 --> 13:27.994
Yay!

13:28.119 --> 13:28.962
Shut up!

13:29.087 --> 13:29.929
Yellow slide's for babies.

13:30.054 --> 13:31.727
You're a baby.

13:33.024 --> 13:34.233
Hey, bud, time for bed.

13:34.358 --> 13:36.670
You want a leg rub
till you fall asleep?

13:36.795 --> 13:38.538
No. I just want you to go.

13:38.663 --> 13:39.706
Oh, I get it.

13:39.831 --> 13:41.007
You want to pleasure yourself.

13:41.132 --> 13:42.241
Ew!

13:42.366 --> 13:44.577
No "ew. " It's natural, honey.

13:44.702 --> 13:46.079
Shameful and natural.

13:46.204 --> 13:47.547
Just get out!

13:47.672 --> 13:49.649
Good night, you Prince
of New England.

13:49.774 --> 13:52.552
You Tom's of Maine.

13:52.677 --> 13:54.721
You want a bedtime song?

13:54.846 --> 13:57.023
♪ I'm never gonna let you go ♪

13:57.148 --> 14:01.394
♪ I'm gonna hold you

14:01.519 --> 14:06.166
♪ Gonna try to make up

14:06.291 --> 14:08.168
Good-bye, room. Forever.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.271
♪ From this day on,

14:12.396 --> 14:13.773
I'll need these on the road.

14:13.898 --> 14:15.008
God willing, I'll have enough time

14:15.133 --> 14:16.275
to slide them on my attackers.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.773

14:17.939 --> 14:21.905

14:27.134 --> 14:27.844
Brian!

14:27.969 --> 14:29.046
I'll kill you, Debra!

14:29.171 --> 14:30.347
Oh, Steve.

14:30.472 --> 14:31.815
Oh, thank God.

14:31.940 --> 14:32.983
Thought you were Debra.

14:33.108 --> 14:35.018
What are you doing out at this hour?

14:35.143 --> 14:36.920
My legal guardian was killing me.

14:37.045 --> 14:38.755
I can't be in that house anymore.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.457
It's all his fault you got evicted.

14:40.582 --> 14:41.925
Oh, I'm past that, Steve.

14:42.050 --> 14:44.127
I'm gonna hit the
road, get out of town,

14:44.252 --> 14:45.695
eat some of these oranges.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.030
It totally sucks here!

14:47.155 --> 14:48.498
Let me come with you.

14:48.623 --> 14:49.805
Yeah, sure.

14:49.971 --> 14:52.093
Get down!

14:54.559 --> 14:57.007
Lew-Lew!

14:57.132 --> 14:59.042
I ain't mad at you.

14:59.167 --> 15:02.769
I just want to talk to you.

15:12.881 --> 15:14.258
Oklahoma?!

15:14.383 --> 15:16.493
Wow! How long was I asleep?

15:16.618 --> 15:18.896
Steve, I'll be perfectly honest.

15:19.021 --> 15:20.998
I thought you were
awake this whole time.

15:21.123 --> 15:22.632
I told you my life story.

15:22.757 --> 15:24.401
Hell, I told you about my stepmom.

15:24.526 --> 15:26.236
Thought you were in a stunned silence

15:26.361 --> 15:28.462
that somebody could
do that to a child.

15:30.032 --> 15:31.975
Man, I can't wait till we get to...

15:32.100 --> 15:33.310
Wait- where are we going?

15:33.435 --> 15:34.934
The Grand Canyon.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.914
Ooh, I'll have freedom out there.

15:37.039 --> 15:38.515
No one making me eat healthy

15:38.640 --> 15:41.023
and tickling my back
even when I don't want it.

15:41.189 --> 15:42.352
That's not right.

15:42.477 --> 15:45.055
Now, a grown black man
and a young white boy

15:45.180 --> 15:47.881
driving cross country-
that feels right.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.797
Now that there- that is sick.

15:53.922 --> 15:55.799
Y'all got a lot of nerve!

15:55.924 --> 15:58.040
This is a public road!

16:00.751 --> 16:03.440
Officer, he's not in the house,
he's not answering his phone.

16:03.565 --> 16:04.774
I'm his guardian.

16:04.899 --> 16:06.609
If anything happens to him,
I'm responsible...

16:06.734 --> 16:07.883
Calm down?

16:08.049 --> 16:09.212
Calm down?!

16:09.337 --> 16:10.504
Okay.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.854
He was exactly right.

16:17.979 --> 16:20.563
That was good advice.

16:20.729 --> 16:21.891
So, I was thinking

16:22.016 --> 16:24.061
about how we could make
a living in Arizona.

16:24.186 --> 16:25.262
I will be a dancer.

16:25.387 --> 16:26.787
What are your skills, Brian?

16:28.923 --> 16:30.500
Oh, Steve.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.700
We're not going to
Arizona to live together.

16:32.866 --> 16:35.661
We're going there to die together.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.640
Uh... pardon me?

16:37.765 --> 16:39.742
I've got nothing left
to live for, Steve.

16:39.867 --> 16:43.169
Which is why I'm driving us
straight into thGrand Canyon.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.116
Suicide, bitch!

16:46.241 --> 16:47.941
Canyon style!

16:51.259 --> 16:52.622
Tickets! Tickets!

16:52.747 --> 16:53.679
Extra tickets.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.725
This place is totally screwing us.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.795
Yeah, well, they're not the only
ones who can do the screwing.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.063
I beg your pardon?

17:00.188 --> 17:01.898
Their stupid water park screws us,

17:02.023 --> 17:05.402
we do the same thing...
to each other.

17:05.527 --> 17:08.671
And we do it in there,
on the biggest slide they got.

17:08.796 --> 17:10.807
Of course that's what we do.

17:10.932 --> 17:13.143
That's brilliant!

17:13.268 --> 17:14.810
Dan?

17:14.935 --> 17:16.646
Dan!

17:16.771 --> 17:18.882
Don't tell my wife where I am.

17:19.007 --> 17:24.085
She's the biggest bitch
in the universe!

17:26.647 --> 17:27.957
Freddy, I can't find Steve.

17:28.082 --> 17:30.060
I haven't seen him
since you introduced us.

17:30.185 --> 17:31.628
This is all your fault, Frederick.

17:31.753 --> 17:33.096
You were his approved friend.

17:33.221 --> 17:35.798
You're supposed to watch out
for him when I'm not around.

17:35.923 --> 17:37.057
You're supposed to...

17:39.594 --> 17:41.018
Don't do that, man.

17:41.184 --> 17:43.240
Look, Steve left
because you smother him.

17:43.365 --> 17:46.376
I'm a good kid because
my parents allow me the freedom

17:46.501 --> 17:47.577
to be myself.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.979
Can you imagine
how nervous they must have been

17:50.104 --> 17:52.196
when I said
I was hanging out with you?

17:52.362 --> 17:55.366
I suppose I am a dangerous,
aggressive stranger.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.220
They let me make my own mistakes,

17:57.345 --> 18:00.121
but I know they're always there
when I need them.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.859
Damn it, Freddy, I've been a fool.

18:02.984 --> 18:04.961
It's not enough to love your kid.

18:05.086 --> 18:07.164
You have to love 'em the right way.

18:07.289 --> 18:08.998
I know what I have to do.

18:09.123 --> 18:11.234
I just hope I can find Steve in time.

18:11.359 --> 18:12.436
Well, I'm glad that...

18:12.561 --> 18:15.136
Be glad about that.

18:17.929 --> 18:18.975
Okay, here's the plan.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.477
You go down first and wait

18:20.602 --> 18:22.079
at the bottom in a ready position.

18:22.204 --> 18:24.347
I'm gonna come down after you,
and by the time

18:24.472 --> 18:26.550
I get to the bottom,
I'll be ready to go.

18:26.675 --> 18:28.642
I'll be there to receive you.

18:30.483 --> 18:32.446
♪ ♪

18:36.017 --> 18:37.908
I'm coming in too hot!
Move back!

18:38.074 --> 18:39.785
What?!

18:39.951 --> 18:40.887
Stan, slow down!

18:47.375 --> 18:50.340
Brian, I don't want
to die in the Grand Canyon.

18:50.465 --> 18:52.065
Please! I thought we were friends.

18:53.301 --> 18:54.444
You thought I let you

18:54.569 --> 18:56.413
in the teacher's lounge
because I like you?

18:56.538 --> 18:58.248
You were my accountant, Steve.

18:58.373 --> 19:00.183
Roger was right.

19:00.308 --> 19:02.892
Ah, and there she is.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.152
Roger!

19:13.318 --> 19:15.237
You! How did you find us?

19:15.403 --> 19:16.399
It was simple.

19:16.524 --> 19:18.168
When you love someone hard enough,

19:18.293 --> 19:20.117
you always know where they are.

19:20.283 --> 19:21.838
That can't possibly be true.

19:21.963 --> 19:23.440
Roger, thank God!

19:23.565 --> 19:24.741
I want to go home!

19:24.866 --> 19:26.143
I can't do that, Steve.

19:26.268 --> 19:28.111
You see this gun I'm pointing at you?

19:28.236 --> 19:30.113
That's what I've been doing
this whole week-

19:30.238 --> 19:31.615
holding you hostage.

19:31.740 --> 19:33.339
Well, not anymore.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.784
What?! No!

19:34.909 --> 19:37.426
Principal Lewis is gonna
drive off the Grand Canyon!

19:37.592 --> 19:39.088
You'll be fine, Steve.

19:39.213 --> 19:41.625
I came here to tell you,
you'll be fine.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.099
And I'll be supporting you
all the way.

19:44.265 --> 19:45.428
Shoot Principal Lewis now!

19:45.553 --> 19:47.597
I love you way too much for that.

19:47.722 --> 19:48.889
See ya, sucker!

19:50.855 --> 19:51.768
Good-bye, bad credit!

19:51.893 --> 19:54.735
Oh, my God!

19:58.199 --> 19:59.276
I don't believe it.

19:59.401 --> 20:01.909
Roger's love is keeping us aloft.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.829
We're gonna make it.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.816
So long, junk mail!

20:06.941 --> 20:08.207
Wait. What?

20:15.255 --> 20:16.793
Steve, I'm so sorry.

20:16.918 --> 20:18.761
I never meant for you to get hurt.

20:18.886 --> 20:20.497
I'm a terrible legal guardian.

20:20.622 --> 20:22.763
You are the worst legal guardian.

20:22.929 --> 20:24.434
I'm sorry, too, Steve.

20:24.559 --> 20:26.403
Surviving that crash made me reize,

20:26.528 --> 20:29.639
I'm on this earth for a reason-
to shape young minds.

20:29.764 --> 20:32.542
I'm gonna get my job back
as principal,

20:32.667 --> 20:35.276
and this time,
I'm gonna do everything right.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.214
Time for your bath, Mr. Lewis?

20:37.339 --> 20:38.715
Please.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.584
Mr. Lewis was my father.

20:40.709 --> 20:43.877
Call me Chocolate Dinosaur.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.620
Dad! Mom!

20:46.786 --> 20:48.658
Steve! Roger!

20:48.783 --> 20:50.159
What the hell is going on?

20:50.284 --> 20:51.728
Well, it looks like you tried

20:51.853 --> 20:53.330
to slingshot yourself into Francine.

20:53.455 --> 20:54.503
Didn't you, Stan?

20:54.669 --> 20:56.630
I came in too hot.

20:56.796 --> 20:58.535
This is the worst day of my life.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.551
Well, you're not getting
your morphine back.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.838
Roger, give it back!

21:01.963 --> 21:03.139
Don't be such a jerk!

21:03.264 --> 21:04.341
God, I'm sick of you!

21:04.466 --> 21:05.709
Come on! Give it! Freddy!

21:05.834 --> 21:07.568
Damn it, Roger, come on!

21:10.843 --> 21:12.716
Freddy.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.064
