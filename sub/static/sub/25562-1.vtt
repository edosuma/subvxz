01:22.160 --> 01:23.626
Hey.

01:23.628 --> 01:25.061
You're still up?

01:25.063 --> 01:26.595
Oh, barely, I...

01:28.800 --> 01:29.899
Yeah.

01:29.901 --> 01:32.936
anyway.

01:32.938 --> 01:34.203
I had a lot of fun last night.

01:34.205 --> 01:35.438
Thanks a lot for that.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.540
Yeah,.

01:37.542 --> 01:38.376
Here.

01:40.445 --> 01:41.279
Awesome.

01:43.381 --> 01:45.314
Make sure you take the
garbage out tomorrow night,

01:45.316 --> 01:46.716
that's garbage night.

01:46.718 --> 01:48.486
Oh, yes, thank you.

01:49.487 --> 01:50.754
I know.

01:50.756 --> 01:52.588
And the batteries are
certainly going low,

01:52.590 --> 01:54.123
so just to heads up.

01:54.125 --> 01:54.991
Okay.

01:54.993 --> 01:55.925
Go be traffic.

01:55.927 --> 01:56.762
Bye.

07:03.234 --> 07:04.069
Hi, Keena.

07:06.271 --> 07:07.736
Hi.

07:07.738 --> 07:09.140
Nice to meet you.

07:12.009 --> 07:12.843
Hi.

07:13.944 --> 07:15.846
Oh, you're a good girl.

08:22.147 --> 08:24.048
Oh, no, what happened?!

08:26.016 --> 08:27.185
What happened?

08:28.419 --> 08:29.987
Did you break this?

08:31.522 --> 08:33.124
Did you break this?

09:09.460 --> 09:11.260
I picked
up a couple of groceries.

09:11.262 --> 09:12.195
Thank you.

09:12.197 --> 09:14.029
I totally meant to go today.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.965
Listen,
to watch the baby.

09:16.967 --> 09:21.437
Well, I gotta call
to watch the baby.

09:21.439 --> 09:23.206
It's
fine, it's just...

09:23.208 --> 09:25.674
You know, I have that bio
exam I have to study for.

09:25.676 --> 09:28.110
Ah, you're
smart, you'll be fine.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.215
Thank you.

09:37.188 --> 09:38.487
You know, I appreciate
everything you've been doing

09:38.489 --> 09:40.055
- for us, right?
- Hi, girl.

09:43.528 --> 09:44.760
supposed to be they're

09:44.762 --> 09:47.532
like five minutes
ago, so I'm gonna...

16:36.807 --> 16:39.241
No signs of forced entry.

16:39.243 --> 16:42.044
No footsteps from the property.

16:42.046 --> 16:44.346
I think it's safe to
say you're home alone.

16:44.348 --> 16:45.280
Okay.

16:45.282 --> 16:46.649
Well, thanks a lot for checking.

16:46.651 --> 16:47.650
No worries.

16:47.652 --> 16:49.217
It's a big house.

16:49.219 --> 16:52.122
You know, played
mind games on you.

16:52.990 --> 16:53.822
Mm.

16:53.824 --> 16:55.724
I was kidding.

16:55.726 --> 16:57.259
We don't get out much.

16:57.261 --> 16:58.560
All right.

16:58.562 --> 16:59.895
I'll be in the area.

16:59.897 --> 17:01.563
If you got any problems, just...

17:01.565 --> 17:02.731
You always call.

17:02.733 --> 17:03.632
Will do.

17:03.634 --> 17:04.465
- Thanks again.
- Okay.

17:04.468 --> 17:05.301
See you.

20:36.313 --> 20:37.314
Hey there!

20:51.929 --> 20:52.762
Hello.

20:55.099 --> 20:55.933
Hey!

20:59.736 --> 21:01.636
You must be the
new house sitter.

21:01.638 --> 21:04.606
Yeah,
just for a few days.

21:05.809 --> 21:07.976
Well, if you need
anything I'm real close,

21:07.978 --> 21:09.311
just across the field here.

21:09.313 --> 21:10.545
Okay.

21:10.547 --> 21:11.947
How long have you
lived here for?

21:11.949 --> 21:13.681
All my whole life.

21:13.683 --> 21:16.051
It's a family farm.

21:16.053 --> 21:18.086
Just out for a walk.

21:18.088 --> 21:19.554
It's a good day for a walk.

21:19.556 --> 21:21.389
So, how was your first night?

21:21.391 --> 21:25.227
It was good, other than I
had a bird fly into my window

21:25.229 --> 21:26.396
and die, so...

21:27.664 --> 21:30.232
I did just grab a bag,
throw it in the creek.

21:30.234 --> 21:32.467
So, it was kind of creepy.

21:32.469 --> 21:34.036
Yeah, that's kind of strange.

21:34.038 --> 21:35.203
Yeah.

21:35.205 --> 21:36.671
Those beauties
usually flock together

21:36.673 --> 21:38.640
this time of year.

21:38.642 --> 21:40.408
Must have got lost or something.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.710
But I'm sure something made
a good meal with him by now.

21:44.814 --> 21:46.314
Well...

21:46.316 --> 21:49.351
Anyway, I'd better get
back to chop some wood.

21:49.353 --> 21:51.553
I promised the Howards
that I'd burn some

21:51.555 --> 21:55.490
of their scrap back
in the fire pit, so...

21:55.492 --> 21:57.559
You know, you might tease
some smoke if you're bored,

21:57.561 --> 21:59.794
if you wanna come out, warm up.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.131
Yeah, will do.

22:02.132 --> 22:03.465
Why not?

22:03.467 --> 22:05.333
All right, well, uh...

22:05.335 --> 22:07.402
If you need anything...

22:07.404 --> 22:08.503
Keep warm and uh...

22:08.505 --> 22:10.038
Oh, by the way, I'm Dallas.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.709
Nice to meet you, I'm Larissa.

45:35.811 --> 45:37.344
Hey, how is it going?

45:37.346 --> 45:39.346
This is going.

45:39.348 --> 45:40.313
Good.

45:40.315 --> 45:42.082
Oh, it's good to hear.

45:42.084 --> 45:43.750
Working, busy.

45:43.752 --> 45:45.352
Okay, nice.

45:45.354 --> 45:46.319
You?

45:46.321 --> 45:48.789
Oh, things are okay here.

45:48.791 --> 45:49.623
Lonely?

45:49.625 --> 45:50.591
Yeah.

45:50.593 --> 45:52.192
Not feeling the greatest, so...

45:52.194 --> 45:54.260
I'm a week late,
so I'm hoping...

45:54.262 --> 45:55.762
Oh.

45:55.764 --> 45:58.432
Yeah, I'm hoping it comes
and then I'll feel better.

45:58.434 --> 46:00.634
That's weird.

46:00.636 --> 46:03.404
Yeah, it's just it's
weird here and I get...

46:03.406 --> 46:06.006
I'm getting these
creepy eerie feelings,

46:06.008 --> 46:08.675
like yesterday I
had to call the cops

46:08.677 --> 46:11.812
because I was hearing all
these noises upstairs.

46:11.814 --> 46:13.313
Creepy!

46:13.315 --> 46:16.049
Like it literally sounded
like someone was up there.

46:16.051 --> 46:16.883
So...

46:17.820 --> 46:20.086
I ended up calling the cop.

46:20.088 --> 46:22.823
And he came and he
checked around and...

46:22.825 --> 46:26.326
You know, he said that no
one's here and, you know,

46:26.328 --> 46:28.061
it's clear, so...

46:28.063 --> 46:29.596
It's just so weird.

46:29.598 --> 46:31.665
I just get these weird feelings.

46:31.667 --> 46:33.099
Have you been working?

46:33.101 --> 46:35.235
Yeah, I've been working
on my lesson plans.

46:35.237 --> 46:36.770
- Okay, well...
- Yeah.

46:36.772 --> 46:37.971
Keep busy.

46:37.973 --> 46:39.773
Yeah, read
it in the journal.

46:39.775 --> 46:41.542
Uh, I'm actually
in the mall right now.

46:41.544 --> 46:43.043
Oh, nice.

46:43.045 --> 46:44.511
I just want to
before I start

46:44.513 --> 46:45.712
- to think about it.
- All right.

46:45.714 --> 46:46.847
So, I'm gonna
have to let you go...

46:46.849 --> 46:48.081
Okay, we will talk soon then.

46:48.083 --> 46:49.082
I'll call you
back as soon as I can.

46:49.084 --> 46:49.916
Sure.

46:49.918 --> 46:51.084
Okay.

46:51.086 --> 46:51.618
- All right.
- Have a good one.

46:51.620 --> 46:52.421
Bye.

49:37.653 --> 49:38.486
Keena.

49:40.122 --> 49:41.056
Come, girl.

49:45.393 --> 49:48.028
Come get some food, Keena.

49:48.030 --> 49:49.197
Come on, girl.

55:19.627 --> 55:20.462
Fire.

55:22.297 --> 55:23.865
You wanna come out?

01:02:41.102 --> 01:02:43.335
Oh, nice to be back in
your own bed, eh, girls?

01:02:43.337 --> 01:02:44.169
Yeah.

01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:45.004
Yeah?

01:02:45.006 --> 01:02:46.038
Have a good sleep.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.872
See you in the morning.

01:02:46.874 --> 01:02:47.707
- Night.
- Night.

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:49.575
Love you.

01:03:06.227 --> 01:03:08.928
Oh, I'm so glad the
kids had a good time.

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:10.430
Me too.

01:03:10.432 --> 01:03:11.931
Mm.

01:03:11.933 --> 01:03:12.765
Good night.

01:03:12.767 --> 01:03:14.502
Good night.

01:05:33.741 --> 01:05:34.576
Susan.

01:05:36.077 --> 01:05:36.976
Susan.

01:07:22.483 --> 01:07:23.315
Susan.
