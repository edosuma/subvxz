01:25.877 --> 01:30.318
And in we go. Boom! Boom!
And this goes like that.

01:30.611 --> 01:33.550
Okay, catch ya later. See ya around.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.747
- Can I have a dream?
- A dream? Absolutely not.

01:36.832 --> 01:39.990
- It's too late, buddy.
- Please! Please, please, please...

01:40.074 --> 01:44.359
Nope. There's nothing I can do,
I'm off the clock. Get a union guy.

01:46.460 --> 01:49.188
Alright, alright, big sulk.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.004
I'll give you a dream. Here we go. Ready?

01:52.088 --> 01:53.445
Yeah.

01:56.095 --> 01:58.054
Um...

01:58.555 --> 02:00.681
so it's a full moon,

02:00.766 --> 02:04.414
and a gang of vampires...

02:04.499 --> 02:07.793
are stalking throughout the graveyard,

02:08.086 --> 02:11.526
and all you have is a little wooden stake.

02:14.405 --> 02:17.408
It's gonna be super dangerous.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.475
It's gonna be super scary.

02:23.288 --> 02:28.251
But not, like, so scary that you come
and you wake up Mom and Dad.

02:29.628 --> 02:32.463
And you're gonna be surrounded

02:32.548 --> 02:35.362
by sexy ladies.

02:37.219 --> 02:39.972
- You ready?
- Yeah.

02:54.778 --> 02:56.676
Tell me how it is.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.397
Go on.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.532
Oscar, your father and I
have something to tell you.

03:41.617 --> 03:44.200
"Your father"? No. Don't say your father.
Your father has nothing...

03:44.284 --> 03:47.669
- You said we could do it now.
- Yeah, I said give him the hamster now.

03:47.753 --> 03:51.239
Don't tell him that and then take it
away from him. Your mother's leaving us.

03:52.182 --> 03:54.598
Peter, don't confuse him.
We need to be honest.

03:54.683 --> 03:56.589
What? I'm being more honest
with him than you are.

03:56.673 --> 03:59.239
Skeet, I'm not leaving you!

04:26.264 --> 04:29.686
It's okay. It's okay.

04:39.049 --> 04:42.885
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.557
- What're you scared of?
- They are so loud.

04:47.641 --> 04:50.080
I don't want to have to move.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.791
What're you doing?

04:52.875 --> 04:55.314
Sometimes, when I feel threatened,

04:55.399 --> 04:59.552
I gather comfort food
and store it in my cheek pouches.

04:59.636 --> 05:04.386
This way, no matter where I wake up,
I don't have to go out and find food.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.244
It's already there. Already in my mouth.

05:08.746 --> 05:11.289
Are you okay?

05:11.373 --> 05:13.400
I'm scared too.

05:13.485 --> 05:16.065
Would you like a pellet?

05:17.442 --> 05:20.163
How about some company?

06:34.039 --> 06:36.582
Skeet, let go.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.814
Please?

06:41.123 --> 06:42.616
Just...

06:58.793 --> 07:03.203
I'm not leaving you, okay?
You'll be with me every second week.

07:17.291 --> 07:19.001
I'm sorry.

07:38.333 --> 07:42.753
Hey. Hey, hey, come here.

07:43.150 --> 07:48.405
Come here. Look, look, it's okay.
It's okay. We're going to be good.

08:11.950 --> 08:16.866
- What's your name?
- Um... how about... Buffy?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.848
Where are you taking me?

08:29.217 --> 08:32.240
It's totally true. I swear to God.

08:32.533 --> 08:35.668
- Hey, buddy, what's that on your nails?
- Anna.

08:35.753 --> 08:37.394
- What?
- Oh, my God, see?

08:37.477 --> 08:39.000
- Leave him alone.
- What?

08:39.083 --> 08:42.885
Well, when boys check their nails, they're
supposed to hold their hand in a claw,

08:42.970 --> 08:46.294
like this. But if you check
your nails from behind

08:46.379 --> 08:48.286
it means you're probably
gonna grow up to be gay.

08:48.370 --> 08:51.844
- Jesus, Anna!
- What? It's not a big deal.

08:56.426 --> 08:59.517
- Give it back!
- What do you got there, buddy?

08:59.601 --> 09:04.418
- Boys, he's got a diary!
- Look, Buffy. I think he needs our help.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.371
- Leave me alone!
- Where are you going?

09:08.455 --> 09:11.405
- Leave me alone!
- We want to talk to you!

09:21.915 --> 09:23.937
- Just be cool, alright?
- Fuck...

09:24.022 --> 09:25.960
Fuck you!

09:27.087 --> 09:28.212
Back off!

09:28.297 --> 09:31.215
Don't touch me, I will fucking hurt you.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.254
Stop it!

09:46.289 --> 09:48.106
Harder, harder!

09:50.602 --> 09:52.761
He's crying.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.618
Do something. Help him.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.498
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

11:23.537 --> 11:26.497
<i>Cloudy and wet drizzle
all the way across the island...</i>

11:26.582 --> 11:29.020
<i>Nothing too surprising there.</i>

11:29.781 --> 11:32.591
<i>A 16-year-old student
has been violently assaulted</i>

11:32.675 --> 11:34.547
<i>behind Bishop Fleming School.</i>

11:34.631 --> 11:39.177
<i>RCMP are reporting that the hate-crime
victim is paralyzed from the waist down.</i>

11:39.261 --> 11:43.348
<i>Police are asking anyone with more information
to please contact Crime Stoppers.</i>

11:43.433 --> 11:47.143
- <i>I'm Lisa Wiseman, reporting for...</i>
- Why did they do that to him?

11:47.332 --> 11:49.948
Hmm? Do what?

11:50.293 --> 11:52.210
Put a metal rod up his bum.

11:52.295 --> 11:56.048
What? Jesus! Where did you hear that?

11:58.009 --> 11:59.760
Uh...

12:04.703 --> 12:06.538
Well, he's gay.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.751
That's why I keep telling ya,
you gotta get rid of this hair, buddy.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.166
You can do it, buddy!

13:09.935 --> 13:12.218
Don't be a wimp.

13:15.691 --> 13:17.667
Hey, are you gonna finish this or what?

13:17.751 --> 13:20.674
If we don't make it to fourth period
I'm not going at all.

13:21.405 --> 13:25.179
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

13:35.784 --> 13:38.588
How many more of these do I have to do?
- Just one more.

13:38.671 --> 13:42.602
Oh, thank God! If I have to wash
any more glycerin out of my bra,

13:42.687 --> 13:45.656
you're the one
that's going to be cleaning it.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.170
Almost done. Just have to set it.

13:48.255 --> 13:50.679
Close your eyes.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.316
- You too.
- Don't tell me what to do!

13:53.400 --> 13:55.240
Big breath!

13:55.908 --> 13:57.721
Mm.

14:00.539 --> 14:04.249
It's good. Just let me get
my camera, then we should go.

14:04.333 --> 14:08.409
Oh, yeah, right. I'm not the only one
going to school looking like this.

14:11.653 --> 14:15.273
Embarrassing number
of unsolicited nude photos

14:15.358 --> 14:17.470
sent between students at our school.

14:17.555 --> 14:21.370
We understand that adolescence
is a very fertile time,

14:21.454 --> 14:26.454
so today we're going to discuss some
traditional methods of showing affection.

14:30.985 --> 14:35.009
And back... head back a little bit more?
There we go.

14:35.093 --> 14:37.699
Yeah, that's good. Play with your hair.

14:37.783 --> 14:40.611
- Like that?
- But...

14:40.696 --> 14:43.789
- a little more sexy.
- What? A little more sexy?

14:43.874 --> 14:46.499
- A little...
- Okay, I'm trying! Jesus. Okay.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.391
- Should I lose a button?
- No, no, no.

14:53.466 --> 14:56.580
- I think we got it.
- Oh, yeah? Can I see?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.326
Mm-hmm. So hot.

15:00.410 --> 15:03.485
Oh... I'm such a slut. Ah!

15:04.877 --> 15:08.521
Oh, I almost forgot, I found us
a shithole apartment in Brooklyn

15:08.606 --> 15:11.505
- that's almost in our price range.
- Mm-hmm.

15:16.864 --> 15:19.887
- Oh, that's... that's awesome.
- Yeah.

15:19.971 --> 15:22.598
- Is that a garbage chute?
- Oh, no... that's a bedroom.

15:22.682 --> 15:24.991
Okay. Weird.

15:38.427 --> 15:41.012
Sorry, I don't know why...

15:41.201 --> 15:44.403
- I know we're like...
- No, it's okay. I'm...

15:49.490 --> 15:53.640
Here, uh... come on over
and I can take those off.

16:09.896 --> 16:13.984
- Peter!
- Oh, hey, Gem, I didn't see you there.

17:16.358 --> 17:19.809
Customers are confused, disoriented,

17:19.893 --> 17:23.676
weak-willed, so all you have to say is,

17:23.762 --> 17:27.242
"That's a nice one." Just say it with me.

17:27.328 --> 17:29.475
That's a nice one.

17:29.559 --> 17:31.894
Do one by yourself.

17:32.395 --> 17:36.336
- That's a nice one.
- Yeah. You're gonna have to work on that.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.610
Okay. So, the second one
is a little bit trickier.

17:39.694 --> 17:42.008
Whatever it is they're holding,
observe the merchandise

17:42.093 --> 17:46.096
and then try to find some kind of
positive statement to say about it,

17:46.180 --> 17:50.375
like, "That looks like
a very cooling fan," or...

17:50.459 --> 17:54.562
"That'll really compliment
your crown mouldings."

17:54.647 --> 17:58.066
- Get it?
- Yeah, I think I get it.

17:58.150 --> 18:02.144
Good. Okay, let's have a go.

18:09.787 --> 18:12.080
That's a nice one.

18:12.790 --> 18:16.292
It has really good... um, pressure.

18:17.420 --> 18:20.297
What's the difference between the two?

18:24.135 --> 18:26.730
That's... a nice one.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.836
Fuck...

18:41.902 --> 18:45.196
Hey, can I borrow your shirt?
I forgot mine.

18:46.011 --> 18:48.345
It might be kind of sweaty now.

18:48.430 --> 18:50.681
Do you perspire a lot?

18:50.765 --> 18:55.311
Not a lot, I mean, I've just been moving
boxes all day, so probably more than...

18:57.086 --> 18:59.711
That's alright. I've worn much worse.

18:59.795 --> 19:02.048
Yeah. Go ahead.

19:16.145 --> 19:17.979
Thanks.

19:18.376 --> 19:22.005
- I'm Oscar.
- Me too.

19:32.662 --> 19:35.406
Ooh, don't look down,
don't look down, don't look down,

19:35.490 --> 19:37.541
don't look down, don't look down.

19:40.461 --> 19:43.522
Oscar, listen, I know what happened
last time, but I really think

19:43.607 --> 19:47.738
it would be a good idea for me to give
the traveling plastic ball another shot.

19:49.074 --> 19:51.221
What is that?

19:51.722 --> 19:54.933
- What is what?
- There is something different about you.

19:55.017 --> 19:56.601
Nothing different about me.

19:56.686 --> 20:01.189
Oh, it's, um, an energy thing.
You look, um... happier.

20:01.545 --> 20:06.131
- I am not happy.
- Oh, my God, Oscar! You are in love!

20:06.622 --> 20:09.997
- You've been watching too many soap operas!
- Who is it and when can I meet them?

20:10.081 --> 20:12.534
I'm not in love, you're insane.

20:12.618 --> 20:16.846
You can't lie to me, Oscar.
I'm your spirit animal.

20:17.764 --> 20:20.803
What are you doing? What are you... Oh!

20:58.977 --> 21:01.443
Hey. Um...

21:01.527 --> 21:04.730
- So...
- Oh, amazing, thank you!

21:04.814 --> 21:07.557
I mean, I don't know... I can do
whatever you want, I didn't know...

21:07.642 --> 21:10.143
No, no, this is perfect
for my final shoot with Gemma.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.167
Yeah? When does your dear
old dad get to take a look-see?

21:14.252 --> 21:17.973
Not yet, I have to finish the branding
for the application first.

21:20.749 --> 21:24.272
Okay, alright. Don't poke your eye out.

21:25.086 --> 21:27.288
Hey! Clean that cage!

21:36.515 --> 21:39.579
Oh, Oscar, can you do me a favor?

21:40.081 --> 21:41.164
Depends...

21:41.248 --> 21:45.147
Could you please build me one
of these elevators for my cage?

21:45.649 --> 21:50.350
- Are you trying to escape too?
- The fear factor excites me.

21:50.987 --> 21:52.947
Mm-hmm.

21:56.552 --> 22:00.167
- Stop! What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning your cage.

22:00.252 --> 22:03.728
I can clean it myself. I'm not a child.

22:04.543 --> 22:06.707
Okay, your highness.

22:26.481 --> 22:29.066
Did you remember your camera?

22:29.151 --> 22:32.327
Okay, good. Oh, can you do my headshot
before you cover me in goo?

22:32.411 --> 22:35.823
- I wanna look somewhat presentable.
- You can try.

22:36.741 --> 22:39.660
So who's Yves Saint Laurent over there?

22:40.057 --> 22:43.854
Oh, he's, um, some guy from work,
I think his name's Wilder.

22:43.938 --> 22:46.548
- Heard he moved here for the summer.
- Oh, figures.

22:46.633 --> 22:50.921
Couldn't be from around here with
that jawline. What's his background?

22:51.006 --> 22:53.987
How am I supposed to know?
I don't know anything about him.

22:58.326 --> 23:00.577
Thanks for the shirt.

23:00.661 --> 23:02.601
Hi.

23:06.188 --> 23:09.377
Uh... he had to borrow my shirt.

23:09.983 --> 23:11.901
Oh.

23:13.921 --> 23:16.218
Oh.

23:20.931 --> 23:23.737
- Just turn a little...
- Like this? Yeah. That?

23:23.822 --> 23:25.654
- You're slaying a sea monster.
- I hate you!

23:25.738 --> 23:28.590
A sea monster is going to jump out
of that water and you have to kill it!

23:28.675 --> 23:30.605
- Out of that water?
- That's your motivation.

23:30.689 --> 23:32.546
- Ready?
- Like that?

23:32.631 --> 23:34.444
Yes, perfect.

23:36.343 --> 23:38.698
So is he into you?

23:39.200 --> 23:40.667
I don't think so.

23:40.751 --> 23:44.808
I don't know, there was something about
the way that he was looking at you.

23:44.893 --> 23:48.405
- He was wearing sunglasses.
- You know, you should try being more aloof.

23:48.489 --> 23:51.802
I feel like you're always just a little bit
too eager when you first meet someone.

23:51.886 --> 23:54.483
- It's kind of a turn off.
- Fuck you.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.874
Just trying to help.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.762
Oh, yeah, camera loves you.

24:02.077 --> 24:06.247
- Thanks for doing this.
- Just don't forget me when you're famous.

24:07.374 --> 24:09.800
So when do you find out about New York?

24:09.885 --> 24:12.351
Uh, sometime in the next
couple of months I guess?

24:12.435 --> 24:16.425
Okay, good, because my dad just
put down first and last month's rent

24:16.510 --> 24:20.448
on that flea-bag Brooklyn apartment last
night, and the garbage chute is yours

24:20.533 --> 24:24.077
- if you want it.
- Fuck you! No way, that's awesome!

24:24.161 --> 24:26.747
Roommates. Wow.

24:28.416 --> 24:31.480
Do you think you're going to be able to
stop yourself from making out with me?

24:31.565 --> 24:33.532
Fuck you!

24:33.617 --> 24:37.163
No! No! No! No more! No more!

24:37.247 --> 24:39.707
No more. No more.

24:40.553 --> 24:42.722
Okay, one more.

24:52.335 --> 24:55.212
What did you get on your last math test?

24:55.870 --> 24:59.112
- 100?
- But it was just a multiplication test.

24:59.196 --> 25:01.010
- Wow!
- That should go on the fridge.

25:01.094 --> 25:04.594
For sure. I don't think
I ever got 100 on a math test.

25:11.938 --> 25:14.961
I'm 18. I don't need to be tucked in.

25:15.358 --> 25:18.190
I wasn't gonna ask, but, um...

25:20.426 --> 25:24.304
This may seem a bit weird,
do you remember that fur hat

25:24.388 --> 25:28.157
- I used to wear when you were a kid?
- Nope.

25:28.501 --> 25:31.895
Well, your father says he
can't find it but I know it's there.

25:32.657 --> 25:36.327
It would mean a lot
to have it back. It was Nan's.

25:42.928 --> 25:45.742
I'm sorry. Never mind.

25:46.452 --> 25:48.663
Good night, Skeet.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.735
Later, klepto.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.161
There we go.

28:06.634 --> 28:08.239
Ugh.

28:08.323 --> 28:10.596
Jesus Christ!

28:22.128 --> 28:24.986
Come here. Come here, you little fucker.

28:27.259 --> 28:29.156
Okay.

28:56.163 --> 28:57.852
Mm.

29:17.684 --> 29:19.456
Hey...

29:19.978 --> 29:22.279
- I want you.
- <i>Your charming, lovable...</i>

29:22.364 --> 29:24.085
- <i>...handsome father is...</i>
- What?

29:24.170 --> 29:27.860
- ...<i>waiting for you at the front of the store.</i>
- I think someone wants you.

29:27.944 --> 29:31.134
<i>Oscar Madly, please come
to the front of the store. Oscar Madly.</i>

29:31.218 --> 29:32.969
Oh, my God.

29:33.054 --> 29:36.806
Oscar! Oscar!

29:37.933 --> 29:40.456
Have you seen Oscar?
There he is. Let's go, let's go!

29:40.590 --> 29:43.438
- What do you want?
- I've been waiting outside for half an hour!

29:43.522 --> 29:47.254
- I told you I was off at 8:00.
- I can't pick you up at 8:00. I have a date.

29:47.443 --> 29:49.715
How was I supposed to know that?

29:49.820 --> 29:52.489
Because we talked about it.
I told you last night.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.908
No, you didn't.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.489
- You're gonna find your own way home.
- Fine.

30:39.808 --> 30:42.163
- Honey, can you pass me the...
- What the...

30:44.813 --> 30:46.795
Oh, my God! Oscar. Sorry.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.150
I thought, uh... I kind of thought your
walk home would take a little bit longer.

30:50.235 --> 30:54.718
- Do you mind?
- Oh, um... this is your new mom.

30:55.219 --> 30:58.523
- It's not. I'm joking. This is Christine.
- Hi, honey.

30:59.286 --> 31:02.934
Excuse me, I didn't know
you were having a rave.

31:06.772 --> 31:08.879
What'd he see?

31:21.329 --> 31:24.840
Is your, uh, your mom
still dating that queer?

31:25.468 --> 31:28.189
Larry? Yeah, they're engaged.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.861
I know stuff about him
that'd make your hair curl.

31:33.945 --> 31:38.490
- He's a nice guy.
- Mm... I bet he's super nice.

31:40.327 --> 31:42.088
Hey, I'm sorry you two met like that.

31:42.172 --> 31:45.560
Christine here, she's even sweeter
with her clothes on.

31:45.644 --> 31:49.001
I feel so bad. That must
have been quite the sight!

31:49.106 --> 31:52.150
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:52.234 --> 31:55.745
- You gotta try these, man. Come on.
- No thanks.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.991
Hmm? No. She made them.

31:58.076 --> 32:01.117
- It's okay. They're a bit overdone anyway.
- I'm just not hungry.

32:01.202 --> 32:04.621
Hey, stop being rude.
Didn't you learn any manners?

32:05.122 --> 32:07.196
Am I embarrassing you?

32:08.292 --> 32:10.219
Are you embarrassing me? No.

32:10.304 --> 32:14.068
But, uh, you're embarrassing
yourself a little bit.

32:14.152 --> 32:16.758
How long can you keep this act up?

32:16.842 --> 32:20.378
How long before you show up at her work

32:20.463 --> 32:24.049
screaming at the top of your lungs
like a fucking child?

32:24.133 --> 32:26.588
- I should go.
- I'm sorry. It's just a little bit sad.

32:26.672 --> 32:28.770
Let me save you some time.

32:28.854 --> 32:33.401
He's possessive, has the temper
of a child and is bat shit crazy.

32:41.867 --> 32:44.182
There he is.

32:56.549 --> 32:58.652
Wow, where did that come from?

33:13.542 --> 33:15.629
So fucking pathetic.

33:15.714 --> 33:18.217
I can't believe we share the same genes.

33:19.759 --> 33:22.344
Well, you know,
I was born in a factory farm

33:22.429 --> 33:25.493
to an overweight rodent
who tried to eat me.

33:25.578 --> 33:28.164
It doesn't mean my life
can't be different.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.453
Oscar?

34:31.206 --> 34:33.416
I'm really sorry.

34:37.274 --> 34:40.235
I had a really hard week, okay?

34:42.467 --> 34:44.992
I didn't mean to take it out on you.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.568
What are you gonna do
with all mom's junk in my closet?

35:00.652 --> 35:03.382
Huh? What? What are you talking about?

35:03.466 --> 35:06.741
Why don't you just give it back to her?
There's no room for any of my shit.

35:07.930 --> 35:11.787
Well, because it actually
doesn't belong to her.

35:11.872 --> 35:15.916
See, when a couple gets divorced,
they have to split everything.

35:16.001 --> 35:20.650
Possessions and assets and...
you know, kids, equally.

35:20.735 --> 35:25.851
She took her half. So technically, like...
Technically, those clothes are mine.

35:25.936 --> 35:29.138
It's very complicated. You'll understand
when you get divorced someday.

35:29.222 --> 35:31.807
So what are you going to do with them?

35:32.204 --> 35:33.705
Nothing.

35:34.623 --> 35:36.667
Okay.

35:44.759 --> 35:47.109
Oh! Uh, excuse me?

35:48.235 --> 35:50.181
Sorry.

35:51.891 --> 35:52.953
What do you want?

35:53.038 --> 35:56.061
Uh, we're looking for front doors
for our new house.

35:56.145 --> 35:58.314
We just got married.

36:08.303 --> 36:10.512
How long are you looking for it to last?

36:10.597 --> 36:12.760
Uh... forever?

36:12.844 --> 36:15.586
Oh, no, none of these are built
to last that long. Locks break down.

36:15.671 --> 36:20.564
Some wear and tear on the hinges.
I'd give that one six, seven years, tops.

36:21.170 --> 36:24.654
Okay. Thanks.

36:27.572 --> 36:29.908
Well, that's a nice one.

36:33.516 --> 36:36.915
Oh, thank God! It smells awful in here.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.459
We need to get you some deodorant.

36:40.804 --> 36:45.349
Wait, what are you doing?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't! Argh! No!

36:45.434 --> 36:48.853
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!
I can't breathe. Let me out! Let me out!

36:48.937 --> 36:51.939
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!

36:54.057 --> 36:56.580
Hey, how much for a blow job?

37:00.355 --> 37:02.794
So, who's your hostage?

37:03.713 --> 37:06.650
- It's my hamster.
- Really?

37:07.046 --> 37:11.129
I thought hamsters were only
for fat girls and Asian kids.

37:12.013 --> 37:14.931
Um... I spent the weekend at my mom's,

37:15.016 --> 37:18.977
so I'm just, uh, bringing
all my stuff to my dad's place.

37:19.791 --> 37:22.188
Yeah, my parents are divorced too.

37:22.273 --> 37:25.254
Uh, what's the word? Empathy.

37:25.651 --> 37:27.340
Thanks.

37:32.429 --> 37:35.910
- Oh, shit!
- What is it?

37:36.829 --> 37:38.850
- Oh, fuck! No, no, no! Don't brake!
- Why not?

37:38.934 --> 37:41.683
No, no, no, she might be under
the brake pedal. Can you check?

37:41.767 --> 37:44.177
- She's not there.
- Watch out!

37:52.501 --> 37:54.979
Oh, my God. It's not funny.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.608
It is. I'm sorry.

37:58.758 --> 38:01.561
Shh... What is that?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.522
No, no, turn it up.

38:08.632 --> 38:10.542
No way...

38:10.626 --> 38:13.069
That little fucker got behind the radio!

38:13.735 --> 38:16.379
- How do we get her out?
- Fuck.

38:17.140 --> 38:18.557
- No, don't open the door!
- Why not?

38:18.642 --> 38:20.955
She' going to jump out
and get hit by a car!

38:21.040 --> 38:23.802
She's a hamster, not a fucking gazelle.

38:30.612 --> 38:34.741
Is now really the best time for that?
She's going to electrocute herself!

38:38.265 --> 38:41.455
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Smoking her out. Get ready to catch...

38:41.540 --> 38:44.124
Are you kidding? You're gonna
kill her with second-hand smoke!

38:44.209 --> 38:47.482
Come on, man.
That's an old wives tale. Get ready.

38:47.566 --> 38:52.009
This is the worst idea I've ever heard.
This is so fucking stupid.

38:56.721 --> 38:58.829
Still nothing?

39:07.190 --> 39:08.649
Got her!

39:08.733 --> 39:10.630
Alright!

39:11.027 --> 39:12.946
Told ya.

39:31.214 --> 39:34.329
- Thanks for the ride.
- Alright. You need some help?

39:34.413 --> 39:38.450
No, it's okay. Dad's not home yet.
I don't even have a key anyway.

39:38.847 --> 39:41.244
You don't have a key to your own house?
What are you, six?

39:41.329 --> 39:46.259
Yeah, my dad's afraid that my mom's
going to steal it, sneak in and rob him.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.106
Right. So what are you gonna do?

39:49.191 --> 39:51.014
I'll probably just hang out
in my tree house.

39:51.099 --> 39:54.716
No way. You have a tree house?
I need to see this.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.178
I don't know.

40:01.515 --> 40:03.527
Yo, this is insane, man.

40:04.101 --> 40:07.896
- So you made this?
- With my dad, yeah.

40:07.980 --> 40:11.150
- Let's climb it!
- I don't know...

40:24.392 --> 40:26.232
Fuck.

40:28.605 --> 40:30.502
Here.

40:31.003 --> 40:32.859
Thanks.

40:35.508 --> 40:37.384
Hey.

40:38.615 --> 40:42.086
- What's his name?
- Buffy. She's a girl.

40:42.348 --> 40:46.490
Uh, I hate to break the news,
but this is totally a boy hamster.

40:46.574 --> 40:48.916
He got balls, check it.

40:51.294 --> 40:55.110
I would've thought you'd seen enough
balls by now to tell the difference.

40:56.132 --> 40:58.300
Just kidding.

40:59.115 --> 41:00.970
Um...

41:01.386 --> 41:04.098
Here, give her to me.

41:04.182 --> 41:06.341
It's him.

41:15.110 --> 41:19.014
This place is wild, man.
What do you do up here?

41:19.098 --> 41:23.931
Um... mostly just come up here
to get away from the house.

41:45.703 --> 41:49.544
- So what are these for?
- It's my, uh, college application.

41:49.629 --> 41:51.937
Yeah? Where are you applying?

41:52.022 --> 41:55.816
Um, there's this awesome cinema
makeup program in New York.

41:56.005 --> 41:59.747
Oh, nice! So come on, man,
show me more of your stuff.

42:01.344 --> 42:04.847
Okay, it's... it's a little weird.

42:25.472 --> 42:27.077
They're cool.

42:28.621 --> 42:31.610
Anyway, I should probably get going.

42:33.730 --> 42:36.490
Oh... Sorry.

42:48.474 --> 42:50.371
You okay?

42:50.455 --> 42:51.747
I'm fine.

42:51.832 --> 42:56.521
Thank you. Although I think I'm going
through a bit of a gender jam.

43:01.237 --> 43:02.696
Whoa! Watch it, man!

43:02.780 --> 43:06.366
Oh, I'm sorry, man!
I thought you were my son's girlfriend.

43:06.450 --> 43:08.598
His girlfriend?

43:13.103 --> 43:15.126
Whoa, watch it! Fuck, man!

43:22.988 --> 43:24.763
Hey.

43:26.366 --> 43:28.450
How was work?

43:28.535 --> 43:30.369
Riveting.

43:31.913 --> 43:33.977
How did you get home?

43:34.061 --> 43:36.141
I walked.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.712
With the hamster?

43:39.796 --> 43:42.632
Yep. With the hamster.

43:47.825 --> 43:49.708
Okay.

44:07.991 --> 44:10.304
- Is that a whale?
- Where?

44:10.388 --> 44:12.467
Right there.

44:12.552 --> 44:15.477
That's called a bad photo.
Let me take that.

44:16.604 --> 44:19.919
- That one?
- Mm-hmm. okay, keep going.

44:20.003 --> 44:22.192
- Mm...
- No!

44:22.276 --> 44:24.402
Not very flattering.

44:24.487 --> 44:26.596
- That one's not bad.
- No. Definitely not.

44:26.681 --> 44:29.720
- No?
- Actually, go back. Right?

44:29.804 --> 44:33.391
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, just let me clean it up.

44:49.981 --> 44:54.234
What? What did you do?
That does not look like me at all.

44:54.319 --> 44:58.478
- I just cleaned up your face.
- No. It's so weird!

44:58.562 --> 45:00.386
You look great.

45:00.471 --> 45:03.206
I don't want to sell myself as
something I'm not. Change it back.

45:03.290 --> 45:06.117
Everyone uses Photoshop
to make themselves look better.

45:06.201 --> 45:09.084
But nobody's going to hire me
if I send in that photo

45:09.169 --> 45:11.157
and then show up to an audition
looking like me.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.847
You'd be lucky to have them
bring you in in the first place.

45:13.932 --> 45:15.439
Excuse me?

45:15.523 --> 45:18.479
It's New York. There's always gonna be
a thousand girls prettier than you.

45:18.564 --> 45:21.042
I'm just giving you a fighting chance.

45:21.893 --> 45:24.240
Fuck you!

45:28.238 --> 45:30.719
Gemma. Let me just print these off.

45:30.803 --> 45:33.785
No, I'll get them later. I have rehearsal.

45:45.484 --> 45:48.632
Hey! Hey, Gem!

45:48.717 --> 45:51.531
You wanna come over for dinner tonight?
I'm making chicken and waffles.

45:51.615 --> 45:55.347
- Sounds delish, but can't.
- So... um...

45:55.432 --> 45:57.474
How're things going with you and Oscar?

45:57.559 --> 46:01.299
We're... fine.

46:04.295 --> 46:07.652
I see, Sorry, I'm just, um...

46:08.570 --> 46:10.929
I was wondering...

46:11.459 --> 46:13.449
you know.

46:13.533 --> 46:15.920
If we're together?

46:16.390 --> 46:18.662
Is that what he told you?

46:18.747 --> 46:21.416
No, of course not.

46:28.590 --> 46:31.300
So, is he...

46:33.470 --> 46:36.118
Is this really happening right now?

46:39.476 --> 46:41.859
Your bag's melting.

46:54.533 --> 46:57.982
Just visualize this is going to this hand.

46:58.066 --> 47:01.866
I can do it just by thinking
about it. Like this...

47:02.186 --> 47:04.306
Here it is.

47:40.558 --> 47:43.289
Oscar, can I see you in my office please?

47:43.373 --> 47:46.593
- Sure, I'll just finish up here.
- It's okay, just leave it.

47:51.110 --> 47:55.572
Things have been pretty slow here lately,
so I'm going to have to let some people go.

47:55.656 --> 47:57.729
And frankly,

47:57.814 --> 48:02.997
you are without a doubt
my most incompetent employee.

48:03.081 --> 48:07.081
I mean, you don't even fit in,
because you know what you want,

48:07.166 --> 48:09.044
and it's not here.

48:09.128 --> 48:11.421
Oh, I can't bring myself to fire you,

48:11.505 --> 48:14.132
because I mean, really,
you are a good kid,

48:14.216 --> 48:16.155
so I'm gonna leave it up to you.

48:16.239 --> 48:19.095
If you wanna stay,

48:19.180 --> 48:20.899
be my guest,

48:20.984 --> 48:25.247
but if you think you can find
what you're looking for,

48:25.332 --> 48:31.886
I would suggest that you stop
wasting your time here.

48:37.636 --> 48:40.159
I think I'm really high.

48:40.993 --> 48:45.935
Okay then. Good.
I think that was good. I think we...

48:46.019 --> 48:48.885
- Okay.
- Yeah, excellent.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.483
Fuck, man.
I can't believe she fired you, too.

48:52.567 --> 48:55.611
- She didn't, I quit.
- Really? What'd she say?

48:55.695 --> 48:57.967
She said I didn't belong here.

48:58.052 --> 49:00.637
Wow, that's good for you.

49:01.868 --> 49:04.161
What are you doing tonight?

49:04.246 --> 49:07.748
Um, probably just working
on one of my models.

49:07.833 --> 49:11.898
Oh, fuck that, I'm taking off to Berlin
tomorrow and my roommate's having a party.

49:11.983 --> 49:13.983
- You're leaving?
- Yeah. I'm just gonna visit

49:14.068 --> 49:16.653
- my cousin for a few months.
- Oh. Awesome.

49:16.737 --> 49:20.365
- Well, you should come.
- To Berlin?

49:20.658 --> 49:23.118
No. To the party.

49:23.723 --> 49:27.154
And you gotta bring a costume, 'cause it's a
Friday the 13th Monster Mash or some shit.

49:27.238 --> 49:30.449
Anyway, you gotta dress up. See ya.

49:46.746 --> 49:48.477
Hey.

49:51.334 --> 49:53.920
You know, you got mail.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.158
Oscar! What's wrong?

50:50.990 --> 50:54.960
What are you doing? Talk to me!

50:58.099 --> 51:02.770
- Are you okay? You're scaring me!
- Can you just shut up? I'm fine!

52:06.011 --> 52:07.971
What do you think?

52:12.267 --> 52:15.973
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't mean it.

52:20.921 --> 52:22.547
What are you doing?

52:28.158 --> 52:30.619
Going to a costume party.

52:32.245 --> 52:35.164
Well, those clothes
don't belong to you, so...

52:35.248 --> 52:37.813
They don't belong to you, either.

52:51.056 --> 52:55.228
That's $50 deducted from your...
from your education savings

52:55.312 --> 52:57.738
for trying to steal from me.

52:57.823 --> 53:00.095
You're pathetic.

53:00.544 --> 53:03.964
You're not going to no faggot
costume party either.

54:00.312 --> 54:04.858
Hey, man. That's your costume?
I thought this was your thing.

54:04.942 --> 54:08.670
- This was all I had.
- Don't worry about it.

54:08.754 --> 54:11.120
Yo, Brigitte!

54:12.888 --> 54:14.960
Oscar needs a costume.

54:15.045 --> 54:17.445
Yeah, no problem, asshole.

54:17.778 --> 54:19.833
Come on.

55:34.511 --> 55:37.450
How much do you think
it would cost for a flight to Berlin?

55:37.535 --> 55:40.224
Why? Do I look like a travel agent?

55:40.621 --> 55:43.808
Wilder just bought a ticket
so I thought you might know.

55:43.892 --> 55:45.886
Is that what he told you?

55:46.648 --> 55:51.792
He's not going to Europe. He's driving
back to Montreal to live with his parents.

55:54.552 --> 55:56.490
Oh.

55:56.783 --> 55:58.702
Thank you.

56:05.125 --> 56:07.586
Want to give me a hand with this?

56:45.102 --> 56:49.314
Wilder! This party's so fun!
There's so many cool people here!

56:49.398 --> 56:53.068
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how dorky I sound. I'm such an idiot!

56:53.152 --> 56:54.590
I'm glad someone's having fun, man.

56:54.674 --> 56:57.134
You're so nice. That must be
why you have so many friends.

56:57.219 --> 57:00.262
Actually, I have no idea
who most of these assholes are.

57:00.347 --> 57:02.765
Yeah, that's so cool.

57:02.849 --> 57:05.100
Stay right here.

57:05.915 --> 57:07.686
Wilder!

57:09.231 --> 57:11.544
What's that on your nails?

57:12.463 --> 57:14.347
Where?

57:16.571 --> 57:18.372
It's gone.

57:19.679 --> 57:21.701
Alright.

57:47.623 --> 57:50.901
- This is your wingman for the night.
- Thanks.

57:50.986 --> 57:53.191
Hey, Wilder!

58:17.778 --> 58:20.134
Oh, can you hold on?

58:20.948 --> 58:23.158
What are you doing here?

58:23.555 --> 58:25.681
Same as you.

58:25.765 --> 58:28.680
So, you didn't happen to tell Peter
that we were dating, did you?

58:28.764 --> 58:31.958
- Because he seemed to think that we...
- Why would I ever say that?

58:32.043 --> 58:34.210
What's with you?

58:34.295 --> 58:38.329
Your pupils are huge. Are you high?

58:38.414 --> 58:41.500
I gotta go find someone.
I'll talk to you soon.

59:08.537 --> 59:10.538
You look like shit.

59:10.623 --> 59:12.415
Thanks.

59:13.438 --> 59:15.439
I'm Andrew.

59:16.671 --> 59:18.610
Hi.

59:21.634 --> 59:24.344
I'm sorry. I'm here with someone.

59:24.929 --> 59:26.409
Who?

59:34.292 --> 59:36.606
I don't think he'll mind.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.817
Hey!

01:02:13.076 --> 01:02:16.515
Hey, man. Hey, man. Wake up.

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:23.549
Better out than in.
Here you go. Drink a bit.

01:02:27.465 --> 01:02:29.008
You okay?

01:02:29.092 --> 01:02:30.394
Mm-hmm.

01:02:30.479 --> 01:02:33.774
- Let's get you home.
- No, I can't. I can't go home.

01:02:33.858 --> 01:02:37.203
Well, this place just got busted,
so you can't stay here either.

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:40.045
Come on.

01:03:38.495 --> 01:03:40.883
You should take that off.

01:04:11.007 --> 01:04:13.446
What are you thinking about?

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:20.181
Thinking about how...

01:04:20.266 --> 01:04:25.152
I had to kick my dad into a closet
to go to that party tonight.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.280
If you don't hate your parents
you'll eventually become them.

01:04:37.512 --> 01:04:40.472
Please, don't kiss me.
I just had the worst day of my life

01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:43.580
and my mouth tastes like vomit and...

01:04:43.873 --> 01:04:46.207
I don't want to ruin this.

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:48.856
I was just grabbing some water.

01:05:07.313 --> 01:05:10.023
How long have you been out?

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:13.505
I'm too embarrassed to talk right now.
Can you just leave?

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:17.426
Come on, don't be like that.
This doesn't have to be awkward.

01:05:18.558 --> 01:05:20.773
It's too late for that.

01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.060
Seriously, since when have you known?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.105
I don't.

01:05:30.816 --> 01:05:32.818
What do you mean?

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:38.302
I don't know.

01:05:41.472 --> 01:05:43.933
Have you ever kissed a guy?

01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:51.189
I've done some stuff, but...

01:05:52.003 --> 01:05:54.381
But have you kissed?

01:06:00.428 --> 01:06:03.619
- Do you want to?
- What?

01:06:03.704 --> 01:06:06.119
Do you want to know?

01:06:09.145 --> 01:06:11.856
I don't know how to answer that.

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.734
If I, a fellow dude, kiss you

01:06:15.819 --> 01:06:18.946
and you feel something
moving around in your stomach,

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.906
then maybe you'll know.

01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:23.304
If not, then...

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.268
My stomach feels like it's on fire.

01:07:19.341 --> 01:07:23.167
So... did you feel anything?

01:07:27.933 --> 01:07:30.066
I don't know.

01:07:34.731 --> 01:07:37.213
I certainly felt something.

01:08:52.809 --> 01:08:55.386
Jesus, Oscar! What are you doing?

01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:57.917
Sorry to impose.

01:08:59.441 --> 01:09:02.506
- Oh, shit.
- What's going on, Skeet?

01:09:10.076 --> 01:09:11.932
Oscar?

01:09:13.622 --> 01:09:16.247
Am I a bad person?

01:09:17.438 --> 01:09:19.877
What are you talking about?

01:09:20.274 --> 01:09:24.027
I don't understand why I feel so alone.

01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:29.412
- You're never alone, Oscar.
- That's rich, coming from you.

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:34.423
- What do you mean?
- You gave up

01:09:34.506 --> 01:09:37.404
and abandoned me
and now I'm all fucked up.

01:09:38.584 --> 01:09:41.492
- That's not fair.
- You have a new life.

01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:44.318
A new family.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.854
I have nothing. Literally, nothing.

01:09:58.708 --> 01:10:02.253
I'm so sorry... Oscar.

01:10:02.858 --> 01:10:05.005
I wish...

01:10:06.862 --> 01:10:11.596
I could have been there for you.
I made some really hard choices.

01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:18.142
But I was dying in that house.
You know that more than anyone.

01:10:25.423 --> 01:10:27.529
You know...

01:10:29.552 --> 01:10:31.928
when you were born...

01:10:32.325 --> 01:10:36.890
you came out with the umbilical cord
wrapped around your neck three times.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.542
You almost hung yourself. I was so scared.

01:10:42.565 --> 01:10:44.941
That's disgusting.

01:10:46.225 --> 01:10:48.560
My point is...

01:10:50.135 --> 01:10:52.699
you've never had it easy...

01:10:54.452 --> 01:10:56.977
and maybe you never will.

01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:04.022
If you are forced to walk through shit
then you might as well grow a thick skin.

01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:09.638
Thanks for all the imagery.

01:11:17.266 --> 01:11:19.852
Skeet, you smell awful.

01:11:36.442 --> 01:11:41.376
Why do I always crave pancakes when every
time I eat them, they make me feel like shit?

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.294
Most things are like that
as you get older.

01:11:48.255 --> 01:11:51.509
Your father's going to be worried
about you, you know.

01:11:52.072 --> 01:11:54.439
No, he's not.

01:12:07.254 --> 01:12:11.193
- I have to go to Peter's.
- Oscar, shouldn't you eat first?

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:14.537
Where's Buffy?

01:14:20.637 --> 01:14:23.265
I'm going to live with Mom.

01:14:27.269 --> 01:14:30.199
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't.

01:14:33.775 --> 01:14:38.530
Do you have any idea
why everyone you love leaves you?

01:14:48.999 --> 01:14:53.878
Oscar, get in the car.
Oscar, get in the car.

01:14:56.086 --> 01:14:58.959
- What is wrong with you, Peter? Huh?
- It was an accident.

01:14:59.043 --> 01:15:01.453
It was an accident?
How's this a fucking accident?

01:15:01.537 --> 01:15:04.664
- Get the fuck off my land! This is my house!
- He's a kid! He's a kid!

01:15:04.749 --> 01:15:07.321
You killed a fucking hamster?
He's a child, Peter!

01:15:07.406 --> 01:15:12.031
I'm going to call the cops and tell them
that a fucking whore is on my lawn,

01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:15.045
and they're going to cart you away.
You left! You left!

01:15:15.129 --> 01:15:17.585
- Yes, I left!
- You left! So leave!

01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:22.052
- How could anyone stay with you?
- You left!

01:15:22.136 --> 01:15:26.129
Go back to your fucking queer
husband and your fucking life!

01:15:26.213 --> 01:15:28.871
- I'm his dad. Where are you?
- This is how you take care of him?

01:15:28.955 --> 01:15:32.735
- You left us both, so leave! So leave!
- This is how you take care of him? Look at him!

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:36.566
- He's a child. He's just a boy!
- He's my child!

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:41.383
You may be his dad, but you
will never be his fucking father.

01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:33.162
Yeah.

01:19:39.206 --> 01:19:41.123
Hey!

01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:45.298
I don't want that sweaty face cloth
dripping all over my new sheets.

01:19:50.258 --> 01:19:52.301
Who let the Brady Bunch into my room?

01:19:52.385 --> 01:19:56.451
Be nice. Larry and the kids
have been looking after you all day.

01:19:56.848 --> 01:20:01.142
Okay, guys, let's go get Oscar
something to eat.

01:20:13.198 --> 01:20:16.346
You have a fever because
you've been completely burning up.

01:20:19.996 --> 01:20:23.040
I'm never going to get out of here, am I?

01:20:23.542 --> 01:20:26.106
What are you talking about?

01:20:27.337 --> 01:20:31.319
I got rejected from Joe Blasco
and I never applied anywhere else

01:20:31.404 --> 01:20:34.311
because I am a stubborn idiot.

01:20:37.639 --> 01:20:40.015
I'm so sorry.

01:20:41.977 --> 01:20:45.104
There's always the makeup diploma
here at Memorial.

01:20:45.501 --> 01:20:49.588
It's not even about the school,
I just need to get out of here.

01:20:51.632 --> 01:20:53.758
What about Fogo?

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.906
Community college?

01:20:55.991 --> 01:21:00.348
It's not a community college,
it's an artist residence.

01:21:00.433 --> 01:21:03.669
It's not New York, but...

01:21:03.754 --> 01:21:07.376
at least you'd be getting away
from your crazy parents.

01:21:08.086 --> 01:21:11.715
Just think about it. Okay?

01:21:15.031 --> 01:21:16.866
Mom?

01:21:18.722 --> 01:21:21.192
What happened to my stuff?

01:21:21.683 --> 01:21:25.033
Whatever was in the driveway,
I threw in the back seat of the car.

01:21:27.866 --> 01:21:29.806
And Buffy?

01:21:49.878 --> 01:21:52.239
So it's official...

01:21:52.323 --> 01:21:54.675
I'm an asshole.

01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:59.883
That explains the new bike, then.

01:24:06.952 --> 01:24:08.359
So...

01:24:09.955 --> 01:24:12.772
It's not New York, but what do you think?

01:24:13.814 --> 01:24:16.779
I think you look happy.

01:24:22.656 --> 01:24:25.303
I hope you don't get eaten by a seagull.

01:24:26.535 --> 01:24:29.885
I'm just happy
you're not gonna set me on fire.

01:24:37.587 --> 01:24:41.069
But you know I'm not the original
hamster from your childhood, right?

01:24:41.153 --> 01:24:46.053
I mean, it has been 10 years.
Your parents replaced me, like, 4 times.

01:24:47.284 --> 01:24:49.160
What was that?

01:24:49.245 --> 01:24:52.813
Oh, nothing. Goodbye.

01:25:45.718 --> 01:25:48.616
Can I have a dream, Dad?

01:25:49.847 --> 01:25:53.100
Come on, you're too old for that now.

01:25:56.009 --> 01:25:59.179
It's time for you to start
making your own dreams.

01:26:01.150 --> 01:26:03.672
You can have anything
you want in this world.

01:26:03.757 --> 01:26:05.959
Just close your eyes.

01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:14.183
I love you, son. I'm so, so proud of you.
