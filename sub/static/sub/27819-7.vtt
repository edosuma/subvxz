barely bother

24:39.083 --> 24:40.786
And yet,
according to Lesnitsky,

24:40.872 --> 24:42.825
he's the final piece
of this plan.

24:43.299 --> 24:44.549
Right.

24:59.715 --> 25:02.114
How the hell did it work out
for you, Novin?

25:02.583 --> 25:03.824
Okay, sure.

25:03.949 --> 25:05.345
I thought Zarkova
was on the level.

25:05.425 --> 25:07.895
I mean, she even had my back
a few times, right?

25:08.028 --> 25:10.449
But I'm over it.
She'll pay.

25:10.535 --> 25:13.731

- We all got fucked, Wyatt.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.434

25:19.840 --> 25:22.168
Yeah, and we dragged you
out of the riverside.

- Yeah, I nearly died.

25:25.135 --> 25:26.691
Yeah, and if they
go after one of us,

25:26.777 --> 25:28.385
they come after all of us.

night hoping you'd pull through.

25:31.192 --> 25:32.419
It wasn't all night.

25:32.505 --> 25:34.246
I popped in, popped out.

25:34.332 --> 25:35.480
Popped back in again.

25:35.574 --> 25:36.801
We took a risk.

25:36.887 --> 25:38.711
It backfired.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.863
That buck stops with me.

25:41.175 --> 25:43.152
So we got to Hassan
before Pavel.

25:43.238 --> 25:45.526
He's the thread that can
unravel this whole thing.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.097
We get a hit
on his phone, Chetters?

25:47.183 --> 25:49.083
- Hassan doesn't own a phone.
- Of course he doesn't.

25:49.168 --> 25:51.801
His nephew, Taufik, however...
I have his number.

25:51.887 --> 25:54.863
And the moment he makes a call,
I can triangulate his location.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.800
Wherever Hassan goes,
Taufik isn't far behind.

25:57.886 --> 25:59.363
I need you all mobile.

25:59.504 --> 26:02.379
I want you reacting as soon as
that phone call comes through.

[♪♪]

26:31.635 --> 26:32.933
You are nervous.

26:33.497 --> 26:34.797
We are two days late,

26:34.885 --> 26:37.055
and Hassan did stress
a cash payment.

26:37.238 --> 26:39.385
But you still think
this will work?

26:39.988 --> 26:42.715
This is the part
of Lesnitsky's grand scheme

26:42.801 --> 26:44.965
I had issues with.

26:45.425 --> 26:47.505
Don't be fooled by appearances.

26:47.746 --> 26:50.505

he was as brutal as they come.

26:54.051 --> 26:55.988
Hassan is not happy.

This is not
what Hassan has asked for.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.199
It is what we have.

27:14.285 --> 27:16.504
Well, Hassan feels like
you do not respect him.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.215
Has he had an accident?

27:18.332 --> 27:19.957
Just something that means
he is unable

27:20.043 --> 27:22.074
- to speak for himself?
- Katrina.

27:23.172 --> 27:24.792
I apologize.

27:26.805 --> 27:28.957
I've considered
your proposal,

27:29.088 --> 27:30.298
and I reject it.

27:30.384 --> 27:31.886
But we already had
an agreement.

27:31.972 --> 27:33.566
Well, Hassan
has changed his mind.

27:33.691 --> 27:35.004
And he does not believe

27:35.090 --> 27:37.566
that Russia
truly supports his cause.

27:37.805 --> 27:40.425
[tense music]

27:40.722 --> 27:42.755
Well, of course we do not
support his cause.

27:42.845 --> 27:44.402
We are using him.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.355
There are things we wish to do,
but we cannot

27:47.441 --> 27:49.988
for fear of reprisals
against our nation.

27:50.203 --> 27:51.722
But you?

27:52.305 --> 27:54.863
Well, we have an expression.

27:55.261 --> 27:56.988
"Blame it on the wolf.

Hey, we don't care
that you got the nukes,

carrying out Lesnitsky's plan.

40:02.052 --> 40:03.352
Yeah.

40:03.447 --> 40:04.817
We knew about all that.

40:04.907 --> 40:06.753

you got out alive.

40:06.845 --> 40:08.385
Soldier to soldier.

40:08.604 --> 40:10.005
And you shot him.

Thank you, Sergeant...

How about you?

40:40.862 --> 40:43.151
How do you feel about all this?

40:43.698 --> 40:45.456
I told you,
you are not my army.

40:45.542 --> 40:48.215
No, we're not.
