WEBVTT

01:07.651 --> 01:09.244
Fuck me.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.249
Fuck me, Mr. Breaker. Oh, shit.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.544
Mr. Drecker, you're so good.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.921
Mr. Drecker, fuck me
like you mean it.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.928
I'm gonna come again.
Oh, fuck.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.935
I'm gonna some again, Mr. Breaker.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.562
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. Oh, fuck.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.441
Look at me. Look at me.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.863
I gotta go back in. It's my party.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.325
- Ah...
- What's the, uh...?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.703
Hey, Logan, what's the occasion?

01:55.866 --> 01:57.243
Tuesday.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.037
You're welcome to join if you want.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.377
Well, what do you want?

02:04.583 --> 02:08.258
I want an apartment in Paris.
I want new parents.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.842
I wanna go back inside
and get another drink.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.176
Why, Mr. Drecker?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.895
What do you want?

02:20.682 --> 02:24.778
<i>It doesn't make sense.
Why would a cop dress up as a cop'?</i>

02:24.936 --> 02:27.655
It makes more sense than
some of these motherfuckers.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.067
Wanna wear diapers
and get fed baby food.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.863
Look, I've been sending Ray
to have sex with her.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.952
Rough sex.
What am I supposed to do?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.991
- She paying you, right?
- Yeah.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.751
Then keep doing what you're doing.

02:39.910 --> 02:43.585
- Most cops fuck for free.
- No, I can't do that. I can't.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.045
I promised Ray I would get rid of her.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.586
She's a paying customer
who will drag your ass in...

02:48.752 --> 02:50.425
if she becomes disgruntled.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.840
Keep her gruntled.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.804
So your ho gets a black eye or two.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.469
It's better than pissing her off
and getting arrested.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.391
- I wouldn't even tell him.
- I have to tell him.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.684
You don't understand.
We're partners.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.150
Man, why do you ask me this shit?
I mean, you come to me for advice...

03:07.312 --> 03:10.907
like I'm some kind of magical
Yoda negro, but you don't listen.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.990
- I listen to the essence of your advice.
- What essence?

03:14.152 --> 03:16.575
Could you not treat me
like I don't know what I'm doing?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.740
I'm a successful pimp.
I'm making money...

03:18.907 --> 03:21.535
and I did it my own way
while you were in jail.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.039
Why did you bail me out then?

03:29.793 --> 03:32.012
Why did you ask me to?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.056
I didn't have the money.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.343
I needed to stay someplace
had a landline...

03:37.509 --> 03:39.477
so they could track me.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.105
I'm supposed to commiserate
with non-felons...

03:42.264 --> 03:44.266
and, well,
you're the only one I know.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.727
And because I like you.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.276
Probably should have put that
at the top of the list...

03:50.439 --> 03:52.316
but, hey, that's me.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.870
What about you?
Why did you bail me out?

04:12.836 --> 04:13.928
Six in the side.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.964
One in the corner. Eight in the side.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.302
Who's next, motherfuckers?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.560
Oh, don't stop.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.852
Oh, don't stop.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.321
Don't stop.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.392
Oh.
- Oh, God.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.935
You scared the bejesus out of me.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.399
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.155
Our hearts are still beating.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.817
- Who let you in?
- Security.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.984
I wanted to get an early...

05:19.319 --> 05:20.536
start.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.745
It's 6:30 in the morning.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.994
I just wanted to familiarize myself
with the system...

05:27.160 --> 05:29.128
so I filed all of the records.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.086
- Chronologically and alphabetically.
- Great. Now go home.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.297
- No.
- Yes, go home.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.671
- I wanna do a good job.
- You are.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.136
Look, and you're running
yourself ragged doing it.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.800
You're sick.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.685
Physically, not mentally.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.767
Nothing wrong with you mentally.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.728
But go home. Go on.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.693
Take an antihistamine,
a decongestant.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.361
Get some rest.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.863
Go on.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.512
- So you like musicals.
- Oh, no.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.974
I mean, I played Adelaide
in high school.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.513
I can tell.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.814
Good morning, Mr. Drecker.
How'd you sleep?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.694
It's good to see you again.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.445
You were always my favorite.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.742
He?
He?'

07:23.485 --> 07:24.907
Aw...

07:25.070 --> 07:26.993
Drink some water, Mr. Drecker.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.202
You'll feel better.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.125
- You can call me Ray, you know.
- I know.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.624
Where are you going?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.587
I'm gonna take a shower,
maybe go back to bed.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.132
What are you doing,
uh, later today?

07:45.298 --> 07:50.555
I'm gonna take a shower
and maybe go back to bed.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.473
<i>Logan Lewis.</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:56.439
<i>She had me in the palm
of her hand.</i>

08:04.067 --> 08:06.911
Ray, I called you 20 times last night.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.448
Shh, shh.
Not so loud.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.750
Oh, my God, you look terrible.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.786
- What happened?
- Ah.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.000
Where were you?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.800
Ray, would you stop?

08:20.959 --> 08:23.553
- Look, I'm trying to talk to you.
- Just talk softly.

08:23.712 --> 08:28.343
Ray, Ray. Lydia's a cop, all right?

08:28.508 --> 08:32.854
I saw her last night in person,
and she's a cop.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.937
- Makes sense.
- Makes...?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.852
<i>Ray, she's Ia policia.</i>

08:39.019 --> 08:42.273
Look, look, she's 5-0
and we're criminals, okay?

08:42.438 --> 08:45.283
But here's the thing.
We need to keep her satisfied.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.194
Satisfied?
What are you talking about?

08:47.360 --> 08:51.615
- I thought we cut this lady loose.
- We need to reconsider that.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.751
Um, apparently
it's common practice...

08:54.909 --> 08:58.755
for prostitutes to keep
police people as clients...

08:58.913 --> 09:01.962
- ...from what I've read.
- She almost busted my ribs.

09:02.125 --> 09:06.631
- I'm out. I'm done.
- Please, let's not go to jail, okay?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.343
I don't wanna go to jail either.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.975
That's why I'm not gonna
see her anymore.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.142
All right, well,
somebody's gotta tell her.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.728
I mean, she can't know we know.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.313
We gotta let her down easy.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.896
- Right?
- You're the pimp.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.064
I'm the p... I'm the pimp?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.904
What? What?
You said we were partners.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.530
Fuck, Ray. She's gonna know
I'm lying. You know, I'm a bad liar.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.245
- She'll see right through me.
- All right, I'll do it.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.833
Call her up. Tell her I'll meet her
in a public place with witnesses.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.292
Great, okay.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.049
Uh, ahem.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.470
Lenore, what about this one?

09:48.630 --> 09:51.053
The ones in the back are better.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.554
She said I could have
any one I wanted.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.106
- Maybe they're better in the back.
- Yeah, I want this one.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.643
And when are you gonna ask
about that other thing?

10:02.644 --> 10:04.442
I'm waiting for the right time.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.274
Okay.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.411
Lenore?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.249
All right, this area.
Anything you want.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.749
- Where's Sandee?
- I think she wants one from the front.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.334
- These have a higher resolution.
- They're dented.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.546
They have a better warranty.
You said we could pick any cane.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.381
Any one of these.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.181
I think Sandee wants one up front.

10:32.340 --> 10:37.688
<i>I think Sandee is a leech and a liar who
faked a pregnancy to try to trap you.</i>

10:37.846 --> 10:42.101
No, she's a great fiancÃ©e, Lenore.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.479
I think that I should be making
more than $200 per woman.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.989
I think 400 is closer
to the going rate.

10:49.649 --> 10:54.371
Jason, your going rate is $200.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.367
How much did they pay you
to fuck me?

11:01.661 --> 11:05.962
How much does your boss
pay you to bus tables?

11:07.584 --> 11:08.631
Hmm?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.546
Yeah.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.965
Pick a TV, Jason. Thank me later.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.809
Understand it's not you.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.023
It's all me.

11:30.899 --> 11:31.946
Uh-huh.

11:32.108 --> 11:36.238
You know, I need to do stuff.
I've never been to Paris.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.873
I mean, I've never been to Africa.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.826
I wanna travel.

11:41.993 --> 11:46.715
You know, riverboat, bicycle.

11:47.498 --> 11:52.800
Are you sure it's not because
I was too aggressive with you?

11:52.962 --> 11:55.932
No, no, I'm positive.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.717
I just...

11:58.551 --> 12:04.479
I thought that I could
let it all hang out with you.

12:04.641 --> 12:09.647
Oh, you can. I mean, you could,
if I wasn't just giving it all up...

12:09.812 --> 12:12.986
but I am.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.410
I'm sweet.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.164
I think I haven't
shown you my sweet side.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.953
I know.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.248
Looking at you now, um...

12:28.748 --> 12:30.750
- Heh.
- I am so different...

12:30.959 --> 12:32.677
from what you think I am,
Richard.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.553
You can't just leave with no warning.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.306
- I can't accept that. I simply can't
- You can't?

12:37.465 --> 12:42.096
Come on, let's just enjoy
each other one more time...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.518
then I'll be happy.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.569
Yes. Oh, Richard, I enjoy you.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.952
- I enjoy you so much.
- Oh, yes. I enjoy you too.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.906
Yeah, papi, yeah!

13:01.072 --> 13:02.198
Ay, how could you leave me?

13:02.573 --> 13:05.122
It's not you, it's me.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.629
I could do this all day.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.130
- All night.
- So could I.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.758
- Every day.
- Yeah.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.380
Yeah.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.466
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.722
- What...?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.303
Oh, I don't know why I did that.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.186
I'm sorry. I never wanna stop.

13:24.345 --> 13:28.100
Never, never, never.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.189
Tell me that you didn't
end it with her...

13:30.351 --> 13:32.194
by having sex with her
in a bathroom.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.946
That was after I ended it.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.403
That's not how you end it, Ray.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.661
Oh, God, I'm the one who said
we should keep her happy.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.868
- You said, "No, I don't wanna see her."
- I don't.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.284
Well, now she thinks
she's still a client.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.452
She says that you wanna
fuck her forever.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.996
That's... Those are not
the words that I used.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.006
Well, those are the words
that she heard.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.259
Well, I was, uh,
in the moment, okay?

13:54.417 --> 13:57.921
She was looking good.
She was wearing a dress.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.057
You had sex with a cop
because she wore a dress?

14:01.215 --> 14:02.762
Well, it had flowers on it.

14:02.925 --> 14:07.101
I mean, look, we were just
two people doing what people do.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.191
- And then she slapped me.
- She hit you'!

14:10.350 --> 14:13.229
She's a violent woman, Tanya.
It's a problem.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.112
Well, now you have
to keep seeing her.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.858
No, I'm not. I ended it.
I made it very clear.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.244
And what happens after that
is besides the point!

14:21.402 --> 14:24.497
Men and their fucking penises.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.421
So, uh, Lydia, you know,
I spoke with Richard...

14:40.588 --> 14:43.888
and he apologizes
if, uh, he gave you the wrong idea.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.848
He's sorry we fucked
at the restaurant?

14:46.010 --> 14:48.388
Oh, no, no. No, no, not at all.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.022
He enjoyed that very much.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.684
He regrets that his actions
were confusing.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.818
He has a lot going on right now.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.856
And. you know,
Richard is leaving the business...

14:58.022 --> 14:59.899
for entirely personal reasons.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.784
Between me and you, I'm furious.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.571
I mean, he left me with no notice,
without a replacement.

15:04.737 --> 15:09.163
I mean, if I don't find somebody soon,
my goose is cooked.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.043
I mean, it's a big problem for me.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.090
Do you think I give a shit
what your problems are?

15:22.255 --> 15:26.260
- Lydia. Lydia, let's be civil.
- Fuck civil.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.979
You know that thing
that I wanted to do?

15:30.138 --> 15:32.812
Well, I wanna do it tonight.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.394
Lydia, that's just... It's not possible.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.861
- Uh, Richard is...
- Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.740
I know when I'm being lied to.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.499
<i>So if you wanna keep
this wellness center...</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:53.503
I strongly suggest a burglar
show up at my house.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.757
Ten o'clock sharp.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.928
Fuck me.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.298
Um...

16:08.885 --> 16:10.512
<i>Hey, this is Ray. Leave your number.</i>

16:10.678 --> 16:12.305
Yeah, Ray, I need to talk to you.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.021
Um, Lydia wants to see you tonight.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.653
She's a scary woman, Ray.
I don't wanna go to jail.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.858
Ray, where are you?

16:20.021 --> 16:21.944
'Whoa-hon! Get her! Ha-ha!

16:22.148 --> 16:23.525
- Aah!
- I'm gonna get you!

16:23.691 --> 16:24.908
I'm gonna get you!

16:25.109 --> 16:27.658
- Get him, kid!
- Go get her. Don't listen to her.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.039
Get the old guy, that old guy!

16:30.198 --> 16:32.041
Goddamn it.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.374
- That's it!
- Get back in your vehicle, sir.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.788
Sir, you must remain... Sir!

16:38.164 --> 16:39.290
You can't do that!

16:39.457 --> 16:42.461
Sir, return to your vehicle.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.008
Come here.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.678
It's cool that you wanted to see me.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.593
I wanted to see you too,
but I need your number, Tanya.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.764
Okay. Okay, we need to talk, okay?

16:53.930 --> 16:56.228
I have... I have something
that might interest you.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.105
- Oh, I'm interested.
- Heh.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.941
All right, stay...

17:01.103 --> 17:04.152
Stay on topic, okay?
This is business.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.492
Did you... '2
Did you tell Lenore about us?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.779
Oh, fuck, no. I'm not her slave.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.539
- I do what I wanna do.
- Oh, my God.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.325
- When do you get off work?
- About 9. Why?

17:14.492 --> 17:20.374
Because... All right, look,
I'm trying to tell you I have a job.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.750
I have a job that might interest you.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.711
Does it pay $400?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.887
Um...

17:29.715 --> 17:30.967
Okay.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.975
Cool.

17:48.651 --> 17:49.698
Shh.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.787
Freeze! Hands where I can see them.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.876
Higher. Nice and high.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.757
That's it.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.883
Got any weapons?
Are you packing?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.473
Are you fucking packing?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.439
What the fuck?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.560
Who the fuck are you?

19:04.435 --> 19:05.982
- Wait, what?
- Unh.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.200
Yeah, yeah. Oh.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.702
Oh, that's beautiful.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.080
Oh, don't stop.
Oh, right there, right there.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.805
Matt, please.

20:20.344 --> 20:24.815
- Am I hurting you?
- No, no, it's not that. Heh.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.066
Am I too big?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.320
I'm too big.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.111
No. It's not that.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.026
- I can go slower if you want.
- No.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.194
- I can go faster too.
- It's not that either.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.614
- Are you okay?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.583
I'm fi... Yeah.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.009
Mm. That's it. I'm good.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.215
- That's it.
- What?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.380
- You're good?
- I'm good.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.093
- Jessica.
- Yeah.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.303
Oh.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.055
Ah.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.058
Um...

21:03.971 --> 21:07.521
- Did you have fun?
- It's late.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.983
- I have to go home.
- Okay, sure.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.447
If you're good, I'm good.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.399
Oh. Heh-heh.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.235
I gotta go.

21:21.197 --> 21:26.545
In 1492,
Columbus sailed the ocean blue...

21:26.702 --> 21:31.082
and he landed in the Caribbean.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.337
Oh...

21:33.083 --> 21:36.178
And he said, "How, big chief.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.557
How do you do? My name is
Christopher and I've discovered you."

21:39.715 --> 21:41.012
Oh.

21:41.175 --> 21:45.601
Uh... Oh, yes, yes, you in the back,
with the beautiful pom-poms.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.640
My name is Logan, Mr. Drecker.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.937
<i>My question was, uh, do you think
you could, like, lose the jockstrap?</i>

21:52.102 --> 21:53.399
It's really distracting.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.237
Absolutely.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.118
You know, the Indians
never wore jockstraps.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.403
Why should I?

22:01.612 --> 22:02.659
Wow.

22:03.030 --> 22:07.661
You must have been fucking gorgeous
when you were 25.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.456
Ray?
- Wait. Shh.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.341
What's wrong? Who is it?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.253
- Ray!
- Oh.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.547
Get... Get-
Get dressed. Hurry.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.135
Why? Are your parents home early?

22:21.298 --> 22:23.551
Shh. It's my ex-wife.

22:23.717 --> 22:24.843
Hide.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.809
- Well, why don't we just ignore her?
- Because, Logan.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.441
Hi. Hey, sorry.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.780
.L..
- Hey.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.321
I was in the area.

22:43.988 --> 22:48.334
Well, yeah, it's...
it's a good area to be in.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.869
He-h

22:50.077 --> 22:51.124
- it's cold.
- Yeah.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.126
Wow, you're wearing a dress.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.542
You look good, really good.

22:56.166 --> 23:01.172
Hi, I'm Logan.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Drecker.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.715
<i>Jessica.</i>

23:02.882 --> 23:05.852
Right. You're divorced.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.888
I'm gonna jump in the shower, Ray.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.852
Nice meeting you, Jessica.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.361
- Jess. Jess.
- Sorry, I should have called.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.238
- No, don't be sorry.
- I said sorry.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.445
Fuck you and accept it
I should have called.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.610
- You're single, I'm single.
- Listen, please.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.529
- You do what you want and I will too.
- Jess.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.822
- Oh.
- Uh...

23:27.656 --> 23:30.455
She's a child. Ray, she looks 18.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.710
No, she's not 18. She's... Come on,
she's much older than that.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.963
- She's like...
- She's like what? Tell me.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.217
What's she like?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.599
We're 43 years old.

23:47.301 --> 23:48.848
What are we doing?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.289
<i>- -on 94. You can see
he cut across several lanes...</i>

24:08.447 --> 24:09.949
<i>in the Harper Woods area.</i>

24:10.115 --> 24:14.165
<i>He went on to go about
another seven or eight miles.</i>

24:19.333 --> 24:21.461
I'm so glad you're here.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.464
So am I.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.133
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.597
Even though you don't listen
to a damn word I say.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.433
- I do listen.
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.474
You listen to my essence.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.445
To my ebony essence.

24:48.988 --> 24:53.038
Here you go, Mr. Drecker, $600.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.038
- Club's open till 4.
- Oh. Heh.

24:57.538 --> 25:01.293
I don't think I'd be much fun.
I am running on fumes.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.552
You're running on empty.

25:03.711 --> 25:06.009
I am no longer 25.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.471
Mm.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.928
You sure?

25:12.094 --> 25:13.971
Wednesday night dollar drinks.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.523
Maybe next time.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.494
Freeze! Hands where I can see them.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.577
Turn around,
put your hands on your head.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.462
- Keep your hands right there.
- Lydia?

25:42.624 --> 25:44.922
You have the right to remain silent.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.213
What are you doing? Wait, stop.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.302
- What are you doing?
- You're under arrest.

25:49.465 --> 25:50.591
Arrest? For what?

25:50.758 --> 25:53.807
Prostitution, motherfucker!
