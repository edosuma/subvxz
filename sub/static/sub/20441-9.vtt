WEBVTT

00:06.509 --> 00:07.841
Just think about it.

00:07.877 --> 00:10.943
On Saturday, over a
quarter-million people

00:10.980 --> 00:12.679
are gonna stream through that building.

00:12.715 --> 00:15.716
A veritable who's who of nobodies.

00:15.751 --> 00:19.152
Richard, we've tried
marketing at trade shows.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.420
We suck at it.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.155
No, I'm not talking about that.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.492
Let me ask you this:

00:25.527 --> 00:27.727
We need 120,000 phones, right?

00:27.762 --> 00:30.196
What is the first thing

00:30.232 --> 00:32.765
people do when they get in there?

00:32.800 --> 00:35.935
Log on to free Wi-Fi.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.604
But Hooli makes you download

00:38.640 --> 00:40.573
the Hoolicon app in order to sign in.

00:40.608 --> 00:46.579
So, what if we somehow hack
our code onto the app?

00:46.614 --> 00:51.250
Then we will have our 120,000
phones all in one day.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.554
I'm sorry. You're... you're
talking about sneaking our code

00:54.589 --> 00:58.090
onto people's phones without
them even knowing about it?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.792
I mean, that's malware, Richard.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.928
No. No, no, no. Think of it more as, um,

01:02.963 --> 01:05.630
forced adoption through
aggressive guerrilla marketing.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.100
Well, as a product of forced adoption,

01:08.135 --> 01:10.969
I can assure you there are consequences.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.671
- I like it.
- Well, hold on.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.674
Even if we get our code into that
app and onto all those phones,

01:15.709 --> 01:19.210
people are just gonna delete the app
as soon as the conference is over.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.145
People don't delete apps.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.414
I'm telling you. Get your
phones out right now.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.917
Uh, Hipstamatic.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.719
Vine, may she rest in peace.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.921
- NipAlert?
- McCain/Palin.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.491
All right, this works in theory,

01:33.526 --> 01:35.893
but... penetrating the Hooli servers

01:35.928 --> 01:38.596
to hack their shitty convention app?

01:38.631 --> 01:40.631
We'd need a black hat
ninja for this one.

01:40.666 --> 01:44.102
I wonder where we can
find someone like that.

01:48.107 --> 01:49.239
No.

01:49.274 --> 01:52.142
It's so great to see you, Mia.

01:52.177 --> 01:55.312
- How's Pakistan?
- It's so great.

01:55.347 --> 01:58.315
I was there for a while,
and as I said before,

01:58.350 --> 02:00.283
I have to go back there right after this

02:00.319 --> 02:02.252
for an extended period of time.

02:02.287 --> 02:04.187
Anyway, how's all this stuff going?

02:04.223 --> 02:06.990
You must be, like, dying of boredom.

02:07.025 --> 02:09.493
I am, but the terms of my plea agreement

02:09.527 --> 02:12.462
forbid me to touch a
computer or go online, so.

02:12.498 --> 02:14.397
Let me run a hypothetical by you,

02:14.433 --> 02:15.932
just to, like, exercise your brain.

02:15.967 --> 02:18.501
Like, for instance, if I had to hack

02:18.536 --> 02:20.469
the Hooli app servers, mess with an app,

02:20.505 --> 02:23.472
and push it out over a
venue's free Wi-Fi...

02:23.508 --> 02:24.674
how would I do it?

02:24.709 --> 02:26.109
It's a trick question, right?

02:26.144 --> 02:27.977
Because you wouldn't
hack the app server.

02:28.013 --> 02:31.347
You'd just launch a man-in-the-middle
attack with Pineapples.

02:32.483 --> 02:34.483
Google it. Speaking of...

02:35.819 --> 02:37.986
if they even catch me
talking about this,

02:38.022 --> 02:40.556
they could send me to
maximum security prison,

02:40.591 --> 02:43.992
but I think I found a way to get online.

02:44.028 --> 02:47.062
- No.
- There's a computer in the library

02:47.097 --> 02:49.265
that's not supervised on Sundays.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.801
I think if I can pull library
duty, I'll be able to sneak on

02:52.836 --> 02:55.537
and track down whoever ratted me out.

02:55.572 --> 02:59.207
I am going to destroy that motherfucker.

03:01.578 --> 03:03.378
Not if I destroy him first.

03:09.052 --> 03:12.753
Excuse me. What's your
policy on anonymous tips?

03:17.787 --> 03:21.716
- sync and corrections by Mr. C -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:24.466 --> 03:27.134
Fuck. Wi-Fi Pineapples. It's so obvious.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.146
Not to me.

03:28.147 --> 03:31.073
Look, we set up a bunch
of these at Hoolicon.

03:31.107 --> 03:35.275
We position ourselves between
everyone's devices and the real Wi-Fi.

03:35.311 --> 03:37.578
So, they log onto our boxes

03:37.613 --> 03:39.814
and our boxes log onto the real Wi-Fi?

03:39.849 --> 03:42.716
- Exactly.
- So, we show them a fake landing page,

03:42.751 --> 03:46.687
and force everyone to download a
doctored version of the Hoolicon app.

03:46.722 --> 03:48.322
And they'll never know the difference.

03:48.357 --> 03:51.325
No wonder Mia's in prison.
She's brilliant.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.060
- I think this might actually work.
- Wrong!

03:54.096 --> 03:55.113
It'll never work.

03:55.115 --> 03:58.165
You don't even know what
we've been talking about.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.532
I don't need to, Richard.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.868
The truth is, we've tried and tried.

04:01.903 --> 04:04.670
Every time we've gotten
a whiff of success,

04:04.706 --> 04:07.741
a giant pelican by the name of Fate

04:07.776 --> 04:11.410
takes a four-and-a-half-pound
shit right on top of us.

04:11.446 --> 04:14.380
There are people who are destined for
greatness and people who are not.

04:14.415 --> 04:16.982
Richard, it seems you and I... are not.

04:17.017 --> 04:19.084
And so, I've had enough.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.153
I'm ending it all tonight.

04:21.188 --> 04:23.856
Suicide? I have a book for you.

04:23.891 --> 04:27.393
No, Gilf. Last night, when
I was sitting out there

04:27.428 --> 04:29.828
by the smoldering husk of my palapa,

04:29.864 --> 04:32.765
- so cruelly taken away from me...
- You burned it down yourself.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.034
which led me to my epiphany.

04:37.471 --> 04:38.771
This epiphany.

04:38.806 --> 04:43.742
"Greetings from Tibet. If you find
yourself in Qamdo prefecture,

04:43.778 --> 04:47.211
do drop in. Gavin Belson."

04:47.247 --> 04:48.480
That was addressed to me.

04:48.515 --> 04:52.317
No, that was addressed to
"Richard Hendricks and company."

04:52.352 --> 04:54.118
Company, of which I am a part.

04:54.154 --> 04:56.288
You're not seriously
thinking of going to Tibet?

04:56.323 --> 04:58.823
You're broke. How the fuck
are you gonna pay for that?

04:58.858 --> 05:02.661
That's where you come
in, my great friends.

05:02.696 --> 05:05.362
I figured we might pass the hat?

05:05.398 --> 05:07.731
Just give whatever you
are comfortable with.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.067
I'll pay for it, whatever it costs.

05:10.103 --> 05:14.038
Well, it seems the smallest
of us has the biggest heart.

05:14.073 --> 05:15.973
Thank you, young Jinathon.

05:16.009 --> 05:18.642
- Business class?
- Premium economy.

05:18.678 --> 05:19.976
You fly one way.

05:20.012 --> 05:22.045
Don't you need a visa to go to China?

05:22.080 --> 05:25.115
Yes. I can call my uncle in Beijing.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.684
He's very corrupt.

05:26.719 --> 05:29.186
That sounded... ominous,

05:29.221 --> 05:31.121
but, gents, it's as I was saying:

05:31.156 --> 05:32.956
Where there's a will, there's a way...

05:32.991 --> 05:34.525
just not for you guys.

05:37.229 --> 05:39.905
No, I will not help you on this mission.

05:39.907 --> 05:40.798
No?

05:40.833 --> 05:43.800
Richard, we always said we didn't
want to end up like Hooli.

05:43.836 --> 05:45.035
How are we like Hooli?

05:45.070 --> 05:48.705
We are trying to give free
Internet to the entire world.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.041
If we have to bend a few
rules here and there...

05:51.076 --> 05:53.008
I mean, it's all for the
greater good, is it not?

05:53.044 --> 05:55.478
Gavin Belson started out
with lofty goals too,

05:55.513 --> 05:59.349
but he just kept excusing immoral
behavior just like this,

05:59.384 --> 06:04.086
until one day all that was left
was a sad man with funny shoes...

06:04.121 --> 06:08.691
disgraced, friendless, and engorged
with the blood of a youthful charlatan.

06:08.727 --> 06:10.559
I am never going to be...

06:11.595 --> 06:12.661
any of that.

06:12.696 --> 06:14.496
Richard, not that long ago,

06:14.531 --> 06:17.666
you agonized over using a stolen log-in

06:17.701 --> 06:19.668
to get into a bake-off with Endframe,

06:19.703 --> 06:21.703
a company that stole from us.

06:21.739 --> 06:24.006
But now you're, what, shrugging off

06:24.041 --> 06:26.708
large-scale cybercrimes
against innocent civilians?

06:26.744 --> 06:29.944
It's a means to an end.
It's not who I am.

06:29.980 --> 06:33.915
I mean, Lincoln had to suspend
habeas corpus to end the war,

06:33.950 --> 06:36.685
- but he restored it after.
- Lincoln?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.886
Richard, it's not that easy.

06:37.921 --> 06:40.756
There's always a next time and
a next time and a next time.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.724
I cannot knowingly contribute
to your moral decay.

06:46.096 --> 06:50.498
Well, what if you didn't do it...
knowingly?

06:50.533 --> 06:54.168
You're always telling me how you
spent your entire childhood

06:54.204 --> 06:57.138
pretending that everything
going on around you was okay.

06:57.173 --> 07:00.207
- Uncle Jerry's game.
- Yeah, that.

07:01.143 --> 07:03.411
Let's play Uncle Jerry's game.

07:04.447 --> 07:06.113
Do you know what you're asking?

07:12.388 --> 07:13.921
Okay, guys, how we looking?

07:15.090 --> 07:17.457
- One second.
- Almost done.

07:17.492 --> 07:20.593
All 12 Pineapples
tested and packed.

07:20.629 --> 07:22.095
Jared, you can come in now.

07:24.300 --> 07:27.234
All right, all of our
swag is in the car,

07:27.269 --> 07:29.937
and I look forward to a
successful promotion

07:29.972 --> 07:32.271
of our legitimate space-saving app.

07:32.307 --> 07:34.240
Yup, that's what this is.

07:34.275 --> 07:35.508
Whatever.

07:35.544 --> 07:40.313
Well, now, gentlemen, this is it.
Goodbye.

07:40.348 --> 07:43.082
Obviously, I don't care to
make a big deal out of it,

07:43.117 --> 07:45.351
so I think it's sufficient
just to go around

07:45.386 --> 07:47.520
and each of you say a memory or two

07:47.556 --> 07:50.156
of times where I've profoundly
impacted your life.

07:51.826 --> 07:53.984
It doesn't have to be a profound impact.

07:53.985 --> 07:55.195
We're leaving now.

07:55.229 --> 07:57.663
- What?
- International flight.

07:57.698 --> 07:59.065
Four hours early.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.967
No, international flights
are three hours early.

08:00.969 --> 08:01.768
It's a new rule.

08:04.505 --> 08:06.738
Gentlemen.

08:08.676 --> 08:10.776
Okay, let's have some fun.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:23.457 --> 08:25.957
First hurdle down.
We're past security.

08:25.993 --> 08:28.726
That made me
nervous, sneaking all that shit in.

08:28.761 --> 08:31.629
Why? We're bringing
tech to a tech convention.

08:35.202 --> 08:37.835
When did Pied Piper get
added to the vendor list?

08:48.548 --> 08:49.614
Oh.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.883
That looks like us.

08:51.918 --> 08:54.851
Oh no, that can't be.

08:54.887 --> 08:58.489
No. This is not what I was promised.

08:58.524 --> 09:00.357
- What? It's fine.
- But they told me

09:00.393 --> 09:02.126
that we would have prominent placement

09:02.161 --> 09:04.495
with proximity to high-traffic corridor.

09:04.530 --> 09:06.630
We're in the
middle of the road here.

09:06.665 --> 09:09.033
- So?
- Yeah, who gives a fuck?

09:09.068 --> 09:12.168
Well, Jared does, and...
and we do as well.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.704
Uh, you know what? Why
don't you go check out

09:14.740 --> 09:16.105
what the bathroom situation's like?

09:16.141 --> 09:19.308
- Yes. Nothing would make me happier.
- Good.

09:19.344 --> 09:22.345
You know, I actually believe him.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.247
Okay.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.816
So, gentlemen,

09:26.852 --> 09:30.153
okay, while Jared's gone,
let's get our bearings.

09:31.089 --> 09:34.690
All right, so, we are here.

09:34.725 --> 09:36.792
Now, you guys deploy the Pineapples.

09:36.827 --> 09:40.163
Start with high-traffic areas,
so that means entrances.

09:40.198 --> 09:41.797
People are setting up
equipment everywhere,

09:41.832 --> 09:43.132
so it shouldn't look that unusual,

09:43.168 --> 09:45.367
but be careful, don't get caught,

09:45.402 --> 09:48.003
- and remember why we are here.
- Richard?

09:48.940 --> 09:50.673
Whoa. Winnie.

09:52.610 --> 09:54.743
- Hey.
- Hello. Hi.

09:54.779 --> 09:56.745
Yeah. Oh.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.503
I haven't seen you since...

10:00.505 --> 10:03.453
Since you threw yourself
down a flight of stairs

10:03.487 --> 10:04.719
to prove how smart you were.

10:04.754 --> 10:07.889
- That whole spaces-tab thing was...
- Kind of petty?

10:07.924 --> 10:11.626
Petty? No, I was gonna say "illustrative
of our vast differences."

10:11.661 --> 10:13.728
- Right.
- What are you doing here?

10:13.763 --> 10:16.298
I'm here helping my friend
launch his new company.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.033
Oh.

10:17.035 --> 10:19.134
"My friend." He's actually my boyfriend.

10:19.168 --> 10:21.703
- That's his booth right there.
- Oh wow.

10:21.738 --> 10:23.972
He's got a big one... I mean the booth.

10:24.007 --> 10:26.140
But, um, boyfriend, uh-oh.

10:26.175 --> 10:28.643
- Awkward.
- Why?

10:28.678 --> 10:32.814
Nothing. It's not. It's actually...
it's cool.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.014
Totally cool. Cool beans.

10:34.049 --> 10:35.048
Beans, beans, magical fruit.

10:35.084 --> 10:36.484
The more you eat, the more you...

10:38.121 --> 10:39.453
- Toot?
- Toot.

10:39.489 --> 10:42.123
Hey, Joel? Come over and meet Richard.

10:43.259 --> 10:44.625
Oh, not... not needed.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.828
- Joel, Richard.
- Not needed. Hey.

10:47.863 --> 10:49.263
Oh. Stairs guy.

10:49.298 --> 10:51.264
Uh, that's quite a booth you got there.

10:51.299 --> 10:53.199
Oh, yes, thank you. We really think

10:53.235 --> 10:55.602
our company's message is
worth getting out there.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.004
Yeah, us too. Us too.

10:57.039 --> 11:01.074
Um, we're just trying to be a bit
responsible with the spending.

11:01.110 --> 11:03.443
Sure, but when I sold my last company,

11:03.478 --> 11:06.546
I realized I had the luxury to
invest in something I believe in.

11:06.581 --> 11:08.214
- Mmm.
- Helping humanity thrive.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.351
That's why I decided to bring
PeaceFare into the world.

11:11.386 --> 11:12.785
Ah, good for you.

11:13.855 --> 11:15.755
Okay. It was great to meet you, Richard.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.657
Yeah, and you too.

11:17.692 --> 11:20.260
- Good seeing you.
- Not if I see you first.

11:22.030 --> 11:25.397
Not that you asked, but you
handled that very poorly.

11:32.940 --> 11:36.942
You know, Jian-Yang, the silence in
the car gave me some time to think

11:36.978 --> 11:40.212
about the fact that our
differences... Jesus!

11:41.549 --> 11:42.781
Sorry.

11:46.387 --> 11:48.953
Jian-Yang!

11:55.629 --> 11:59.397
- Fuck you, fat fuck.
- Pineapple two is a go.

11:59.432 --> 12:01.933
Fucking look at him,
pictures everywhere.

12:01.968 --> 12:03.568
Fucking bearded baby.

12:03.603 --> 12:05.503
Cost us millions of dollars.

12:05.538 --> 12:07.405
It would make me very happy

12:07.440 --> 12:11.509
to pour boiling metal down
Keenan Feldspar's asshole.

12:11.544 --> 12:13.043
How would that even work?

12:13.079 --> 12:14.278
Flip and pour.

12:14.314 --> 12:17.081
He's gonna run, and then
you're slowly chasing him,

12:17.116 --> 12:19.650
trying to not spill your
vat of boiling metal.

12:19.686 --> 12:22.753
- You're gonna look like a fucking idiot.
- Fuck you.

12:23.656 --> 12:25.523
- Anybody looking?
- No, just go.

12:28.828 --> 12:30.694
What's taking you so long? Hurry up!

12:33.099 --> 12:35.265
What are you boys up to?

12:37.669 --> 12:41.504
All right? I go through my slides.
Click, click, click.

12:41.540 --> 12:42.906
Jamiroquai plays.

12:42.942 --> 12:47.210
Now, I would very much like
to welcome my good friend,

12:47.246 --> 12:49.279
Keenan Feldspar!

12:51.316 --> 12:54.251
- Where the fuck is he?
- Yo.

12:54.286 --> 12:56.419
Son, you're supposed to be
coming up from over there.

12:56.455 --> 12:59.222
Totally, I'm just really kind of
digging the vibe over on this side.

12:59.258 --> 13:01.725
- Uh, Terry?
- Yeah?

13:01.760 --> 13:04.526
- Kid wants to come from over here.
- Okay.

13:04.562 --> 13:06.129
Excuse me, sir, do you have a moment?

13:06.164 --> 13:09.265
This morning, Pied Piper were

13:09.300 --> 13:11.200
a last-minute add to the vendor list,

13:11.236 --> 13:14.370
so I started watching them and
noticed some suspicious behavior.

13:14.405 --> 13:16.505
I sent in for our
tactical response team,

13:16.540 --> 13:17.940
and with your permission,
I'd like to sweep

13:17.976 --> 13:20.242
the convention floor with
Yagi antennas, which are...

13:20.278 --> 13:21.843
- Hoover.
- Yes, sir.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.945
Four days ago, I spent $2 billion

13:23.981 --> 13:27.082
on a piece-of-shit VR gadget
that's never gonna work.

13:27.117 --> 13:29.685
I had to rebuild the
entire operating system

13:29.720 --> 13:33.422
just to get a 90-second demo
that could play on a phone.

13:33.457 --> 13:36.024
And by the grace of God, I
just may have pulled it off.

13:36.059 --> 13:38.927
And now you want to talk to
me about Pied fucking Piper?

13:38.962 --> 13:41.863
Sir, I'd like to think that if Gavin
Belson were here, we'd make sure...

13:41.899 --> 13:45.400
Gavin fucking Belson is not
here 'cause I fired his ass!

13:45.435 --> 13:47.836
Now, look, you go back to
your little security room,

13:47.871 --> 13:50.038
you sit in the corner
with a tinfoil hat on,

13:50.073 --> 13:52.774
and I swear, if I hear you
wandered down the hallway

13:52.809 --> 13:55.943
to take a piss, you are out on your ass.

13:55.978 --> 13:57.244
You got that?

13:58.715 --> 14:00.181
I do, sir.

14:07.557 --> 14:11.926
You know what? This might be a good
time for me to hand out some flyers.

14:11.961 --> 14:14.494
Richard, six
Pineapples up, six to go.

14:14.530 --> 14:16.797
- Good.
- Something wrong?

14:16.833 --> 14:19.066
Yeah, actually. Very wrong.

14:19.101 --> 14:22.069
PeaceFare is a game.

14:22.104 --> 14:23.904
- What?
- Yeah, look at his website.

14:23.940 --> 14:27.574
Give virtual coins to
virtual homeless people.

14:27.609 --> 14:32.178
Grow virtual corn to feed
virtual starving villages.

14:32.214 --> 14:34.314
What the fuck, right? I
mean, he's over there

14:34.350 --> 14:37.818
making all this noise about turning your
mobile device into an empathy machine,

14:37.853 --> 14:40.487
- but it's not doing anything.
- Fascinating, Richard.

14:40.522 --> 14:44.023
Have you heard anything about how
Pied fucking Piper is doing?

14:44.059 --> 14:46.226
Yes, our code is in the app,
the Pineapples are online,

14:46.261 --> 14:49.295
and we're at 3700 downloads.
We're ahead of schedule.

14:49.331 --> 14:50.930
Shit. This could work.

14:50.966 --> 14:52.332
That's awesome.

14:52.367 --> 14:53.900
Yeah, exactly.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.701
We are doing something real.

14:55.737 --> 14:59.037
He is not, but she's with him,

14:59.073 --> 15:02.708
and I'm the petty one. Okay,
well, what about the idea

15:02.744 --> 15:05.978
of growing real corn to
feed real starving people?

15:06.013 --> 15:08.280
- No.
- Yeah, his thing seems way easier.

15:08.315 --> 15:10.048
Yeah, you can do it on your
phone in your underwear.

15:10.084 --> 15:12.951
Just... plant the rest of
the Pineapples, please.

15:19.693 --> 15:21.626
- Oh! Here he comes, folks.
- Oh, thanks.

15:21.661 --> 15:24.562
Richard Hendricks, the
Monet of compressionism.

15:24.598 --> 15:26.098
Jared.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.934
Hey, which of the bathrooms is closest?

15:28.969 --> 15:31.936
Uh, end of the row, 78
paces to the right.

15:31.971 --> 15:34.171
Great.

15:34.207 --> 15:37.275
Do you know this is the actual
laptop I used to code the app.

15:37.310 --> 15:40.077
Hey, let's take some without
my shoes, yeah? Perfect.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.178
Okay. Oh, hey, come.

15:41.214 --> 15:43.715
Yeah, so please start with my toes.

15:43.750 --> 15:44.783
Oh, nice.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.484
Can you... And these
are photos of irrigation,

15:47.520 --> 15:49.353
captured in the rain.

15:49.389 --> 15:51.789
Yeah,
it's gonna look great.

15:51.824 --> 15:52.990
Yeah, like that.

15:53.026 --> 15:54.458
Poverty and penthos.

15:54.493 --> 15:55.659
That looks so good.

15:55.694 --> 15:57.259
Let's do another one.
Go on the other side.

15:57.261 --> 15:57.829
Yeah.

16:11.577 --> 16:13.477
- Did you do this?
- What? What?

16:14.680 --> 16:16.980
Did anyone see someone
touch this laptop?

16:17.015 --> 16:19.550
- Hmm? What?
- Oh God.

16:20.618 --> 16:22.986
This is very disturbing.

16:23.021 --> 16:24.620
Fuck it. I'm just gonna punch him.

16:24.656 --> 16:27.090
Yeah, right. Have fun
in jail, you moron.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.858
- Oh shit.
- Oh fuck, it's him.

16:28.893 --> 16:31.161
- What do we do?
- Uh, keep moving.

16:37.569 --> 16:39.134
Fuck, do you think he saw us?

16:39.170 --> 16:40.736
Oh, he saw us.

16:40.772 --> 16:42.037
- Fuck.
- He saw us see him.

16:42.073 --> 16:46.342
Shit. Wait. What if he
thinks we did it on purpose,

16:46.377 --> 16:48.110
like, we snubbed him?

16:49.280 --> 16:53.482
Fuck yeah. We just snubbed the
fuck out of Keenan Feldspar.

16:54.818 --> 16:56.751
- Hey, Richard.
- Hey.

16:56.787 --> 17:00.589
I'm letting everyone know you might
want to reset your critical passwords,

17:00.624 --> 17:02.324
because we've been hacked.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.027
Oh! Uh, why... why would you say that?

17:05.061 --> 17:07.997
Someone changed my
PeaceFare screensaver...

17:08.031 --> 17:08.490
Hmm?

17:08.492 --> 17:09.866
and I know it wasn't
anyone on my team,

17:09.900 --> 17:11.332
because they all respect me too much.

17:11.367 --> 17:14.035
What did they change it to? If you
don't mind me asking, just 'cause...

17:14.069 --> 17:16.137
No, no, I won't dignify
it by repeating it.

17:16.172 --> 17:18.271
I'm just saying you
should take precautions.

17:18.308 --> 17:19.773
Also, Winnie spoke to security,

17:19.810 --> 17:21.977
and they're sending the
tactical response team.

17:22.012 --> 17:23.678
The what?

17:23.714 --> 17:25.946
The... Oh, here they are.

17:34.124 --> 17:35.589
Oh shit.

17:35.625 --> 17:39.160
Bingo. We've got hostiles.

17:39.195 --> 17:43.130
Red team, Sebastian, fan out
and sweep the entire venue.

17:48.004 --> 17:50.470
Hey, Richard.
Guess who has four thumbs

17:50.506 --> 17:52.472
- and just snubbed Keenan Feldspar.
- Us.

17:52.508 --> 17:55.175
Guys, someone called security, now
they're doing a sweep of the area.

17:55.210 --> 17:55.677
What?

17:55.679 --> 17:57.078
Okay? You've gotta go
pull all the Pineapples.

17:57.112 --> 17:58.579
What the fuck? Who ratted us out?

17:58.614 --> 18:01.548
I don't know. Probably we'll never know.
It's impossible to tell.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.116
Just go. Go get... get them now.

18:03.152 --> 18:04.584
Go. Just go. Please.

18:07.423 --> 18:08.788
Oh.

18:08.823 --> 18:11.058
- Bingo.
- Fuck!

18:11.093 --> 18:12.492
Come on.

18:12.528 --> 18:15.128
Bingo.

18:15.164 --> 18:17.096
Oh crap. We've got to split up.

18:17.131 --> 18:19.465
I'll take the food court. You
take the east concourse.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.200
- I want the food court.
- Just go!

18:21.235 --> 18:22.435
Fuck.

18:24.338 --> 18:27.206
- Hey, man.
- F-f-f-fucking Keenan.

18:27.241 --> 18:31.143
- Hey, I have to go.
- Totally. Hey, did you snub me earlier?

18:31.179 --> 18:33.679
- No.
- Yeah, you did.

18:33.714 --> 18:35.414
You know you did.

18:35.450 --> 18:37.450
You made me feel bad.

18:37.485 --> 18:40.286
I like to feel good. Why
would you do that to me?

18:40.321 --> 18:41.420
Seriously?

18:42.356 --> 18:43.956
You fucked us, Keenan.

18:43.991 --> 18:45.757
Richard was gonna take that deal,

18:45.793 --> 18:47.626
and then you pulled it
right out from under us.

18:47.661 --> 18:50.762
You cost me, personally,
a shit-ton of money.

18:50.798 --> 18:53.865
Whoa. Is that what Richard told you?

19:03.811 --> 19:07.778
Hey. So? They got every
single one, every single last one.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.114
- Fuck!
- I don't want to hear this.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.649
But we gotta be close, right? Like,
how many more phones do we need?

19:11.684 --> 19:13.985
I don't know. Close isn't good enough.
No, this is binary.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.153
Either we have enough or we don't.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.722
Oh f-f-f-fuck. Okay, I have an idea.

19:17.757 --> 19:22.893
So, I've got one Pineapple left. Now,
I've rigged some batteries on top of it,

19:22.929 --> 19:24.695
- because we're gonna have to go mobile.
- Oh.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.698
We have to try. Okay, I'm going
to put this in your backpack.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.966
- Oh no.
- No, it's fine.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.901
- I don't want it. I don't want it.
- Dinesh, it's fine.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.536
And you, you're gonna
hold this kill switch,

19:32.571 --> 19:35.906
and then you're gonna walk into the most
densely populated area you can find.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.842
All right? If you see
the security coming,

19:37.877 --> 19:39.643
remember, you press that
button and, poof, you're gone.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.412
Yeah? Okay.

19:40.414 --> 19:42.614
I'll get as many of those
motherfuckers as I can.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.448
We'll be rewarded in the end.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.350
When the fuck were you gonna tell us?

19:46.385 --> 19:49.453
- Tell you what?
- You know what, fat sack of shit.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.355
- Richard, do you know what?
- No, I don't.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.657
I-I... I don't know what.
Dinesh, you need to move.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.642
Well, not until I find
out if you know what.

19:56.327 --> 19:59.129
- Go on.
- Okay, fine.

19:59.164 --> 20:03.366
Fine. I messed with Joel's screensaver,
and then he told security,

20:03.401 --> 20:05.969
and now they're the ones
pulling up all the Pineapples.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.772
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

20:08.807 --> 20:11.340
You acted like you wanted to
take Keenan Feldspar's offer.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.977
Well, I just ran into him.
He said you turned him down.

20:15.012 --> 20:20.349
Well, n... Okay, well... Who are
you going to believe, me or him?

20:20.385 --> 20:23.152
Him. He showed me the
e-mail you sent him.

20:23.188 --> 20:24.320
Showed you the e-mail?

20:24.355 --> 20:26.289
You fucking snake.

20:26.324 --> 20:29.992
Dinesh, you need to move, now.
Look, he pulled the deal.

20:30.027 --> 20:32.627
Yeah, but you didn't know that when
you sent him the e-mail, did you?

20:32.663 --> 20:34.797
Dinesh, you need to move.
I mean, come on.

20:34.832 --> 20:36.932
- You need to go. Go. Go.
- Gentlemen.

20:38.235 --> 20:41.036
I'm going to have to see the
contents of that backpack.

20:41.906 --> 20:44.073
Um...

20:45.242 --> 20:46.308
Bingo.

20:46.343 --> 20:47.509
Huh.

20:53.483 --> 20:55.450
What did you change it to, Richard?

20:55.485 --> 20:56.951
What?

20:56.986 --> 20:58.253
Joel's screensaver.

20:59.323 --> 21:01.155
It doesn't matter now.

21:01.191 --> 21:02.223
No?

21:03.827 --> 21:05.292
PoopFare.

21:06.796 --> 21:09.496
I'm sorry. PoopFare?

21:09.532 --> 21:12.466
Yeah, it was, like, a play on the name.

21:12.501 --> 21:16.670
Is it a play on the name?
PissFare would be way better.

21:16.706 --> 21:18.405
Or PenisFare.

21:18.441 --> 21:21.642
Or PeaceFart. That's just
changing one letter.

21:21.677 --> 21:24.545
Look, he... he turned around.
I had, like, a second, okay?

21:24.580 --> 21:26.012
It's the best I could come up with.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.015
PoopFare?

21:32.521 --> 21:33.787
PoopFare?

21:34.957 --> 21:37.257
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

21:37.292 --> 21:39.492
You sacrificed...

21:39.527 --> 21:41.728
everything that we've worked for...

21:43.065 --> 21:44.464
for PoopFare?

21:46.368 --> 21:48.534
How was PoopFare...

21:50.105 --> 21:51.871
for the greater good?

21:52.807 --> 21:53.773
It wasn't.

21:53.808 --> 21:56.576
You compared yourself to
Abraham Lincoln, Richard.

21:58.413 --> 22:00.079
Can you do me a favor?

22:01.383 --> 22:03.716
Can you say it so I know
I'm not hallucinating?

22:03.752 --> 22:05.718
- I just did.
- Just...

22:05.754 --> 22:07.119
- Just say it.
- say it.

22:07.155 --> 22:09.955
- Jared.
- Richard, look me in the eyes!

22:09.991 --> 22:13.759
Look me in the eyes, and you name...

22:14.728 --> 22:17.263
- our undoing!
- Hey, come on. Calm down now.

22:17.298 --> 22:21.433
PoopFare! You reckless child.

22:21.468 --> 22:24.336
Gentlemen. Come with me, please.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.006
Sit down.

22:29.075 --> 22:30.342
Well, well, well.

22:31.545 --> 22:32.544
Richard Hendricks.

22:32.579 --> 22:34.413
Sorry, do I know you?

22:34.448 --> 22:37.081
No... but I know all about you.

22:38.719 --> 22:42.120
These Wi-Fi Pineapples...
are they yours?

22:43.924 --> 22:46.090
Uh-huh.

22:46.126 --> 22:49.127
And this image from
the security footage?

22:49.162 --> 22:50.428
<i>Smell anything?</i>

22:50.463 --> 22:53.464
These two individuals
look familiar to you?

22:55.568 --> 22:56.667
Last question.

22:58.538 --> 23:00.838
Do you recognize this?

23:00.873 --> 23:04.041
It's an interview I just
found from <i> Code/Rag</i>

23:04.076 --> 23:05.743
from October of this year,

23:05.778 --> 23:09.913
in which you said you and
Gavin Belson would, quote,

23:09.949 --> 23:12.082
"put Jack Barker out of a job."

23:12.117 --> 23:14.351
Did you say that, Richard?

23:16.322 --> 23:19.990
You know what? Yes. Yeah.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.124
Yeah, this is me.

23:22.361 --> 23:26.730
Because apparently
everything I say or type

23:26.765 --> 23:29.766
gets me into trouble,
because I'm a... idiot.

23:29.801 --> 23:32.201
Well now.

23:36.441 --> 23:37.741
Tenley!

23:39.478 --> 23:41.611
What the hell are these
gentlemen doing in my office?

23:41.646 --> 23:43.880
We caught them with Pineapples.

23:43.915 --> 23:47.616
You mean the Pineapples that I hired
them to bring to the conference

23:47.651 --> 23:51.320
as part of a covert penetration
test of our Wi-Fi security?

23:51.356 --> 23:54.991
- Sorry, we didn't know.
- You weren't supposed to.

23:55.026 --> 23:59.095
Now, give these gentlemen their
passes and equipment back

23:59.130 --> 24:00.930
and get them back on the floor.

24:03.467 --> 24:06.268
You know, you said some very nice things

24:06.303 --> 24:08.970
about Gavin Belson in that interview.

24:09.006 --> 24:12.207
You could've very easily kicked
a good man when he was down.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.310
Good luck with whatever
it is you're doing.

24:15.345 --> 24:19.747
I'd walk you down myself, but for
reasons I really can't get into...

24:20.717 --> 24:22.217
I'm not allowed to leave this room.

24:24.487 --> 24:25.553
Okay.

24:35.365 --> 24:38.098
There you are. You never
came back to the booth.

24:38.134 --> 24:39.867
You didn't want to see
how it all turned out?

24:41.337 --> 24:42.670
I wasn't really in the mood.

24:42.705 --> 24:43.738
Are you playing PeaceFare?

24:43.773 --> 24:47.842
Yeah. I just gave an orphan
her first calculator.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.444
Good. Good.

24:49.479 --> 24:52.579
But I've
got something much better.

24:55.517 --> 24:56.716
See that number?

24:57.987 --> 25:01.188
That is the number of installs

25:01.223 --> 25:03.790
that we've got from Hoolicon alone.

25:03.826 --> 25:06.793
We have moved all of Melcher's data

25:06.829 --> 25:09.629
onto a network of mobile devices.

25:09.665 --> 25:12.499
- We did it.
- Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know?

25:12.534 --> 25:14.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they know.

25:14.235 --> 25:16.035
Now that this worked,
they like me again.

25:16.071 --> 25:18.572
They're off getting
churros to celebrate.

25:18.607 --> 25:21.942
I told them that we would meet
them at Barker's keynote, so...

25:22.911 --> 25:23.910
come on.

25:23.946 --> 25:26.079
I mean...

25:26.114 --> 25:31.117
Richard, the fact that you think that
success justifies all your behavior...

25:31.152 --> 25:33.786
We were in crisis mode, okay?

25:33.821 --> 25:37.423
And yeah, I lost my head,
but crisis averted,

25:37.459 --> 25:41.060
so it's time to reinstate
habeas corpus, huh?

25:41.096 --> 25:42.561
Be Honest Abe again.

25:42.597 --> 25:44.864
What about the next crisis, Richard?

25:45.768 --> 25:48.368
Jared, this won't happen again. I swear.

25:48.402 --> 25:51.236
So, let's just enjoy it...

25:51.271 --> 25:52.771
for a minute.

25:53.908 --> 25:55.107
Please.

25:58.879 --> 26:01.913
Come on, give it up!

26:01.948 --> 26:05.517
I love this company!

26:05.552 --> 26:07.419
And how about you?

26:07.454 --> 26:09.187
And how about Jamiroquai?

26:09.223 --> 26:12.724
Ladies and gentlemen, oh, let's have it.

26:12.759 --> 26:15.960
But wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:15.996 --> 26:21.633
Wasn't the original title of their
chart-topping hit "Virtual Insanity"?

26:21.668 --> 26:24.702
Why is he singing "Virtual Reality"?

26:24.738 --> 26:28.272
You know, I may need a little help

26:28.307 --> 26:29.674
getting to the bottom of this

26:29.709 --> 26:33.844
from my very good friend,
Keenan Feldspar!

26:39.052 --> 26:42.619
Oh! There he is! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

26:42.655 --> 26:45.656
You guys ready to see the future?

26:47.226 --> 26:49.492
You know, at the beginning
of the presentation,

26:49.528 --> 26:54.130
I told all of you to update
your HooliPhone OS, right?

26:54.166 --> 26:56.066
Now, I want you to go into "Settings,"

26:56.101 --> 27:00.571
and you're gonna find a brand-new
toggle labeled "HooliVR."

27:00.606 --> 27:01.404
Woo!

27:01.440 --> 27:03.640
You're gonna want to turn that on.

27:03.676 --> 27:05.442
Now, look under your seats.

27:06.744 --> 27:09.979
When you power up your HooliVR goggles,

27:10.014 --> 27:12.715
they will "automagically"
pair with your phone.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.150
Put 'em on

27:14.186 --> 27:16.286
and prepare to be amazed!

27:16.321 --> 27:20.156
Say hi to that barmaid for me.

27:20.192 --> 27:22.558
Huh? Oh! Ow!

27:24.095 --> 27:26.428
Oh shit! Fuck!

27:29.634 --> 27:30.800
What's going on?

27:30.835 --> 27:34.971
Uh, turn up the lights, please.
Something's happening here.

27:35.006 --> 27:37.039
Uh, stay calm.

27:37.075 --> 27:39.408
You don't think this had
anything to do with us, do you?

27:39.443 --> 27:41.484
We appear to have a bit
of a technical problem.

27:42.413 --> 27:45.214
I'm going to get to the
bottom of this right away.

27:45.249 --> 27:46.248
Ow! Fuck!

27:50.554 --> 27:53.288
<i>Gelong-la,</i> there is a
loud man here to see you.

27:53.324 --> 27:54.689
He says you sent for him.

27:54.725 --> 27:57.959
Qamdo in the house!

27:57.995 --> 28:00.061
Whoa! Haircut?

28:01.231 --> 28:03.297
Are you fucking kidding me?

28:03.333 --> 28:04.398
No.

28:05.669 --> 28:07.435
I'm really here.
