He was the lookout,
but he wouldn't
give up his accomplice,

in Castaic.

He's an emerging player
in the drug trade

Why would you hire me

to my discretion.

trust has to go both ways.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.704
When Nancy was 16,
they were involved in
a string of robberies.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.227
Dante was arrested,
convicted,

27:00.401 --> 27:02.621
and spent time
in a juvenile facility.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.971

They haven't seen each other
in over 20 years.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.758

Nancy was never identified
in the robberies,

27:09.932 --> 27:11.630
or she wouldn't be
a police officer today.

27:11.804 --> 27:14.241
They offered Dante a deal
to give her up.

27:14.415 --> 27:15.808
He didn't take it.

27:15.982 --> 27:18.027
Who said there's no honor
among thieves?

27:18.201 --> 27:21.030
She used the opportunity
to turn her life around.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.077
But I think Dante
is threatening

27:24.251 --> 27:28.211
to use her past as leverage
in his murder trial.
