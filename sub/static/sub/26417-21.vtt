WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.656
What up, elders?!

00:03.699 --> 00:05.812
Can't believe in a couple hours,
I'll be in Taiwan.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.626
Why are you dressed
like a man

00:07.728 --> 00:09.484
who yells at women
in Times Square?

00:09.572 --> 00:10.953
Oh, my fuzzy Kangol?

00:11.041 --> 00:12.624
Since I'm going on
this cultural exchange,

00:12.711 --> 00:14.671
I can switch my look
without Trent clowning on me.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.117
That boy hates change.

00:16.204 --> 00:17.439
Quick Taiwan question...

00:17.527 --> 00:19.333
Is the boys' bathroom symbol
the same?

00:19.421 --> 00:21.486
I'm not going to answer that,
but take a seat.

00:21.574 --> 00:23.867
Now, since this is
your first trip by yourself,

00:23.955 --> 00:25.923
your mother and I
want you to be prepared.

00:29.570 --> 00:31.240
That's a lot
of Taiwanese cash.

00:31.328 --> 00:33.015
Consider this
your emergency fund.

00:33.103 --> 00:35.013
Please don't use it
to get into a Taipei disco.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.484
I want to be there
for your first time.

00:36.571 --> 00:38.001
And just in case,

00:38.101 --> 00:40.025
we got you
a pre-paid cellphone.

00:40.113 --> 00:42.275
It's programmed with
Big Auntie's number in Taipei.

00:42.363 --> 00:43.250
Sick!

00:43.338 --> 00:44.378
I'm gonna wear this
on my belt,

00:44.465 --> 00:46.150
like a vacationing
businessman.

00:46.594 --> 00:48.541
Johnson, you better have
a damn good reason

00:48.629 --> 00:49.658
for calling me in Cancún.

00:49.746 --> 00:50.951
This is not a joke!

00:51.104 --> 00:53.908
Do you know the number
for 911 in Taiwan?

00:54.002 --> 00:55.259
Uh...

00:55.533 --> 00:57.182
It's 119.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.870
By the time
you've figured that out,

00:58.958 --> 00:59.958
your stolen kidney

01:00.046 --> 01:02.846
has already been
sewn inside a rich man's son.

01:03.306 --> 01:05.080
And last
but not least...

01:07.768 --> 01:09.994
Is this... for my butt?

01:10.083 --> 01:11.377
It's a neck pillow.

01:11.465 --> 01:12.986
It'll help you
fall asleep on the plane

01:13.074 --> 01:15.221
so you can avoid
the deadly effects of jet lag.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.525
Deadly?

01:16.613 --> 01:17.656
Deadly.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.010
My first day in America,

01:19.098 --> 01:21.408
I'm walking across the street,
feeling good,

01:21.496 --> 01:23.244
and then bam... jet lag.

01:23.332 --> 01:25.135
I get hit by a bus,
and then I die.

01:25.232 --> 01:26.322
That sounds made up.

01:26.410 --> 01:28.736
Some facts changed
for dramatic effect.

01:28.884 --> 01:32.294
All I'm saying is,
immigrating here was hard.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.554
I'm saving the real story
for my memoir... Dark Waters.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.307
Seriously, guys, relax.

01:37.395 --> 01:38.525
I can handle this trip.

01:38.613 --> 01:41.377
Oh, I thought I could handle
everything when I moved to America.

01:41.465 --> 01:42.465
My first week here,

01:42.553 --> 01:44.393
I was working
as a seafood delivery guy...

01:44.877 --> 01:47.941
...when my
mediocre English got me lost.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.221 --> 02:00.421
Uh...

02:00.775 --> 02:02.783
Uh, friendship gift crab?

02:09.705 --> 02:12.423
Guys, I've heard these stories
a million times.

02:12.511 --> 02:13.798
We just want you
to be careful.

02:13.886 --> 02:14.966
When you're
in a new country

02:15.053 --> 02:15.978
and you don't
speak the language well

02:16.066 --> 02:18.267
and you don't have any money,
it can be dangerous.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.994
But I've been in Taiwan before,

02:20.082 --> 02:21.634
and I'm not just
a little kid anymore.

02:21.845 --> 02:23.775
Trust me... I got this.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.353
Johnson, I'm with my kids
at the beach.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.791
This better be good.

02:57.317 --> 02:59.753
I'll remember
this performance forever.

03:02.863 --> 03:03.833
Amazing!

03:03.921 --> 03:05.821
Speech!
Let's hear some words!

03:17.446 --> 03:20.183
Kidding!
I'll be speaking English.

03:20.271 --> 03:21.171
Excellent.

03:21.271 --> 03:22.837
You're not here
to be challenged.

03:22.925 --> 03:25.509
You're here to have fun
and learn about your heritage!

03:25.603 --> 03:26.611
Oh, thank God.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.775
You're hilarious, man.

03:29.914 --> 03:31.509
Pete...
Newark, New Jersey.

03:31.655 --> 03:33.189
Eddie... Orlando.

03:33.551 --> 03:34.634
You're from Newark?

03:34.722 --> 03:35.862
Do you know Redman?

03:36.029 --> 03:38.275
Comes to my dad's sporting goods
store all the time.

03:38.363 --> 03:40.411
Dude goes through
a lot of tents.

03:40.708 --> 03:41.851
What about you?

03:41.951 --> 03:43.974
You meet anyone cool, like, uh,
like Penny Hardaway?

03:44.061 --> 03:44.961
A few.

03:45.061 --> 03:46.961
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, DMX,

03:47.049 --> 03:48.279
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis...

03:48.391 --> 03:49.740
Billie Jean King.

03:49.828 --> 03:51.831
Damn!
Oh, we gotta hang out.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.736
I need me
some Terry Lewis stories.

03:55.082 --> 04:00.197
Now, you all ready to do some
traditional mountain paintings?

04:01.292 --> 04:02.392
Me neither.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.780
Let's get some Boba Tea
and go to the mall!

04:07.702 --> 04:09.572
What a beautiful day
for a ride.

04:09.660 --> 04:10.890
Isn't this perfect?

04:10.978 --> 04:13.788
With Eddie gone, we can enjoy
fun family activities

04:13.876 --> 04:15.465
without
any "Eddie surprises."

04:15.553 --> 04:16.527
"Surprises"?!

04:16.615 --> 04:18.567
Last time we went biking,
he cut my brakes!

04:20.661 --> 04:23.795
Tell my storyyyyyyyy!

04:23.998 --> 04:26.240
I made a whole list
of things to do

04:26.343 --> 04:28.069
now that we are
Eddie-free,

04:28.157 --> 04:30.053
including
a daily bike ride.

04:30.141 --> 04:32.443
I think this time apart from him
is gonna be good for us.

04:32.553 --> 04:34.411
You know,
us riding together like this

04:34.511 --> 04:36.764
reminds me of that scene
in The Sound of Music.

04:36.852 --> 04:40.226

Oh! Look at that fanny pack
shaped like a wiener dog!

05:10.641 --> 05:11.506
That's so cute!

05:11.594 --> 05:12.865
I mean... cool.

05:13.017 --> 05:14.347
Cool.
I-I don't say "cute."

05:14.435 --> 05:15.865
Nah, if it's cute,
say it's cute.

05:15.953 --> 05:18.584
Like, uh, this foam cowboy hat
with a built-in radio?

05:18.672 --> 05:19.772
That's pretty cute.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.074
I'm-a get that
for my bro Emery.

05:21.161 --> 05:23.061
A Hello Kitty-themed
Chinese yo-yo?

05:23.149 --> 05:25.428
Cute as hell!
I'm-a get that for my moms.

05:25.516 --> 05:27.225
Now I need something
for my dad.

05:28.291 --> 05:29.748
That crab backpack!

05:30.044 --> 05:31.530
Don't get me wrong...
It's cute and all,

05:31.617 --> 05:33.131
but why would your dad
want that?

05:33.219 --> 05:34.785
Oh, he told me
this dumb story

05:34.873 --> 05:36.101
about him
and some live crabs

05:36.201 --> 05:38.029
to scare me about
living in another country.

05:38.241 --> 05:39.795
That backpack will be
a funny jab.

05:43.463 --> 05:46.115
Dance Dance Revolution
Extreme?!

05:46.217 --> 05:47.709
We just got DDR
in the U.S.,

05:47.797 --> 05:49.350
and they already have
a sequel in Asia!

05:49.438 --> 05:51.208
I hope you wore
your loose-crotched pants,

05:51.296 --> 05:52.696
'cause we about to
go to work!

05:52.784 --> 05:54.454
Wait, hold up...
Before we hop on,

05:54.549 --> 05:57.319
I need to call my boy Trent...
He's obsessed with DDR.

06:01.831 --> 06:02.803
Hello?

06:02.891 --> 06:04.845
Trent? You will not believe
what I found in Taiwan.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.802
Eddie? It's 1:00
in the morning.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.100
They have DDR Extreme!

06:09.318 --> 06:10.741
DDRX?!

06:10.841 --> 06:12.185
Put the phone
on the edge of the screen

06:12.272 --> 06:13.818
and let me
listen to you dance.

06:16.511 --> 06:18.281
♪ DDR ♪

06:19.911 --> 06:21.482
♪ DDR ♪

06:21.570 --> 06:22.803
Wonderful.

06:27.842 --> 06:28.798
Crap!

06:28.891 --> 06:30.134
We were supposed to
meet our group

06:30.221 --> 06:31.506
a half-hour ago
by the bus!

06:31.594 --> 06:33.473
Dude, it's easy
to get around Taiwan.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.774
We can just
take the subway home...

06:34.861 --> 06:36.812
After we finish
another round of DDR.

06:36.905 --> 06:38.105
My hips just warmed up!

06:38.193 --> 06:39.577
<i>We're waiting
for you! Are you ready?</i>

06:49.762 --> 06:52.220
Wow, Jessica.
You broke out the fancy china.

06:52.376 --> 06:54.563
I thought this only came out
for weddings and funerals.

06:54.651 --> 06:56.691
With Eddie gone,
we can use the good stuff

06:56.790 --> 06:58.806
without worrying
about him breaking it.

06:58.899 --> 07:00.626
I know we have a funeral
coming up,

07:00.714 --> 07:02.017
but I figured, why wait?

07:02.105 --> 07:03.251
Whose funeral?

07:04.861 --> 07:05.791
No one's.

07:05.879 --> 07:07.532
Okay, come on, eat up!

07:07.620 --> 07:09.892
There's half a pork shoulder
left. It's the good half!

07:09.980 --> 07:11.407
- I'm stuffed.
- Me too.

07:11.495 --> 07:14.025
Hmm. I cooked
my usual portions.

07:14.199 --> 07:17.017
I guess with Eddie gone,
we'll just have more leftovers.

07:17.182 --> 07:19.622
This morning, I had
my usual bowl of Lucky Charms,

07:19.710 --> 07:21.910
and there were
so many more marshmallows.

07:21.998 --> 07:23.876
I haven't seen a Shamrock Hat
in years.

07:23.964 --> 07:25.657
Ugh. He'd pick
a marshmallow out

07:25.745 --> 07:27.215
and say,
"Top of the morning to you,"

07:27.303 --> 07:30.673
in that weird Irish accent
that sounded like Dracula.

07:30.761 --> 07:32.801
"Top of the morning to you."

07:32.972 --> 07:34.892
Do any of you know
what color boxers I'm wearing?

07:34.982 --> 07:37.912
No. Because Eddie's not here to
administer my daily pants-ing.

07:38.034 --> 07:39.574
<i>Speaks Chinese...</i>

07:39.662 --> 07:42.292
And look at our Costco
bulk toilet paper pack.

07:43.925 --> 07:45.385
Barely a dent.

07:45.556 --> 07:47.813
Hey, maybe we should call Eddie
and see how he's doing.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.142
No!

07:49.230 --> 07:50.771
If he needs us,
he'll call.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.774
But I miss him.
Don't you?

07:52.985 --> 07:54.352
No.

07:54.655 --> 07:55.925
Oh, come on.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.657
We have plenty to talk about
besides Eddie.

08:08.053 --> 08:09.242
Isn't the weather
beautiful today?

08:09.329 --> 08:10.061
Sunny.

08:10.149 --> 08:11.654
- So sunny!
- Very sunny.

08:14.071 --> 08:16.191
Back to this funeral...

08:20.362 --> 08:22.071
Oh, crap.
I'm outta cash.

08:22.188 --> 08:23.663
I just got carried away
buying gifts.

08:23.751 --> 08:25.376
Can you cover me?
I'll get you back.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.022
I only had enough
for one fare.

08:27.122 --> 08:28.753
Okay, we'll figure out
another way home.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.642
Sorry. I'm hopping on
the next train.

08:30.730 --> 08:32.590
Connie Chung's granddaughter's
in the program,

08:32.678 --> 08:34.118
and if I don't make a move
at lunch,

08:34.208 --> 08:36.181
I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

08:36.586 --> 08:37.852
Is she cute?

08:38.159 --> 08:40.663
Breaking news...
She re cute.

08:40.758 --> 08:41.628
Oh.

08:43.581 --> 08:45.915
Oh, wait! Um, what's the address
to our dorm, again?

08:46.091 --> 08:49.261
825 Lane 199,
Xiazing Road.

08:49.361 --> 08:52.101
Uh, 825
21 J-Jump Street...

08:52.201 --> 08:53.301
Crap!

09:05.005 --> 09:06.035
We're okay, Crabby.

09:06.511 --> 09:07.651
I'll just call Big Auntie,

09:07.751 --> 09:09.081
and she'll come pick us up.

09:12.541 --> 09:13.611
Ugh!

09:13.789 --> 09:15.953
I used all my minutes
calling Trent!

09:20.813 --> 09:23.473
Excuse me.
Want to buy this Garfield?

09:23.691 --> 09:25.861
Hi! Meow-meow!
You want to buy this cat?

09:27.603 --> 09:30.343
I know there's some Mandarin
in me somewhere. Um...

09:37.156 --> 09:38.156
Yo-yo!

09:38.477 --> 09:39.881
Yo-yo!

09:40.466 --> 09:41.944
Yo-yo?

09:43.393 --> 09:44.710
Oh.

09:56.358 --> 09:58.776
What's wrong?
Why is everybody so down?

09:59.862 --> 10:02.268
I think we're just a little sad
because we miss Eddie.

10:02.356 --> 10:03.886
He's only been gone
a few hours.

10:03.974 --> 10:07.684
<i>Speaks Chinese...</i>

10:08.146 --> 10:09.376
Come on, Jessica.

10:09.464 --> 10:11.589
You don't miss him
even just a little bit?

10:11.823 --> 10:13.526
It's okay to admit it
if you do.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.854
Do you miss breakfast?
That was a few hours ago.

10:16.942 --> 10:18.142
Even I have to admit,

10:18.321 --> 10:20.581
I miss Eddie's
great conversation skills.

10:20.669 --> 10:22.519
This meal's a dud
because he's gone.

10:22.730 --> 10:24.197
Eddie?! What...

10:24.285 --> 10:26.215
How is Eddie
a great conversationalist?

10:26.364 --> 10:28.074
He just
keeps the chat flowing.

10:28.204 --> 10:29.634
Like when someone's
telling a story,

10:29.722 --> 10:31.118
he asks smart questions

10:31.206 --> 10:32.925
and brings other people
into the dialogue.

10:33.013 --> 10:35.253
I can do that.
Okay, somebody tell a story.

10:35.341 --> 10:36.706
I'll fill in for Eddie.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.484
Okay. Well, a funny thing
happened in gym class...

10:39.572 --> 10:42.012
- What was it?
- I was just getting to that.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.260
What day of the week
was it?

10:43.348 --> 10:45.690
- That's irrelevant.
- Emery, jump in.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.881
Do you think the day of the week
is irrelevant?

10:47.981 --> 10:48.911
I don't know.

10:49.011 --> 10:50.221
Louis, what about you?

10:50.321 --> 10:51.887
Do you think the day of the week
is irrelevant?

10:51.974 --> 10:54.331
I think you should let Evan
finish his story first.

10:54.419 --> 10:55.744
Great point, Louis.

10:55.832 --> 10:57.172
Evan, continue.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.480
So, the gym teacher's
wearing shorts...

10:59.568 --> 11:02.620
Ho!
An adult man in shorts!

11:02.708 --> 11:04.667
Jenny,
isn't that ridiculous?

11:04.819 --> 11:06.698
I am uncomfortable.

11:06.823 --> 11:08.792
Louis, make a joke
about your mother's discomfort.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
Oh. Um...

11:09.970 --> 11:10.956
Not as uncomfortable

11:11.044 --> 11:13.134
as when we have to hear you
sing Peking opera.

11:14.198 --> 11:15.471
How dare you!

11:15.571 --> 11:17.886
Aw, geez. The wheels are
really coming off this meal.

11:17.974 --> 11:20.626
But everybody is talking,
and the energy is way up.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.034
Jessica,
you have to admit,

11:22.122 --> 11:23.544
it's just not the same
without Eddie.

11:23.631 --> 11:24.701
I agree.

11:24.981 --> 11:26.081
It's better.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.891
You're just romanticizing him
because he's gone.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.620
You did the exact same thing
with Grandma's bird.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.308
"Gigi was so funny.

11:33.396 --> 11:35.166
I wish Gigi was here."

11:35.254 --> 11:37.794
You forgot
that Gigi ate all our Band-Aids

11:37.882 --> 11:39.452
and nested in the VCR.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.022
That doesn't sound
like Gigi.

11:41.110 --> 11:42.430
She pecked you
in the face, Louis.

11:42.528 --> 11:44.241
W... That was a kiss!

11:51.023 --> 11:53.723
Xiazing Road?
I'm only one stop away!

12:02.614 --> 12:03.974
Speaks Chinese..

12:04.062 --> 12:04.998
What's happening?

12:05.086 --> 12:06.908
End of the line.
Get off.

12:06.996 --> 12:08.303
Are we at Xiazing Road?

12:08.391 --> 12:09.974
That was 15 stops ago.

12:11.475 --> 12:12.912
Where are my bags?!

12:13.318 --> 12:14.123
Dang.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.763
Jet lag is real.

12:16.138 --> 12:17.478
Did you see
that huge mustache

12:17.566 --> 12:18.881
on the hot dog guy
we just passed?

12:18.968 --> 12:20.598
Bet Eddie would've
zinged him good.

12:20.846 --> 12:22.486
Yeah,
something clever like,

12:22.574 --> 12:24.412
"Hey, you got a caterpillar
under your nose."

12:24.500 --> 12:25.888
No. Not like that.

12:25.994 --> 12:28.185
Since you all
miss Eddie so much

12:28.273 --> 12:29.616
I thought
I would do something for you.

12:29.703 --> 12:30.535
What do you mean?

12:30.623 --> 12:33.568
Oh, no! Big turn coming up!
Better slow down!

12:35.391 --> 12:36.491
My brakes don't work!

12:36.591 --> 12:37.561
Mine either!

12:37.661 --> 12:39.243
Oh, no!
It's happening again!

12:39.331 --> 12:40.946
How do I
stop this thing?!

12:41.034 --> 12:43.680
As you can see,
I have clipped your brakes.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.733
You all miss Eddie so much?

12:45.881 --> 12:48.191
Here's a reminder
of what you're actually missing!

12:48.471 --> 12:49.971
Aim for the lily pads!

12:51.608 --> 12:52.775
I'm sorry, Crabby.

12:52.863 --> 12:54.541
Don't worry.
We'll find a way home.

13:09.711 --> 13:11.721
Guys, let's be friends.

13:12.329 --> 13:14.377
Um...
do you like comedy?

13:14.465 --> 13:17.455
I-I can do a really good
leprechaun impression.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.860
"Me gold's
at the end of the rainbow!"

13:21.007 --> 13:24.775
<i>Speaks Chinese...</i>

13:24.863 --> 13:25.763
No, please.

13:25.851 --> 13:27.205
It's the only thing
I have left.

13:27.293 --> 13:29.553
Hey, don't worry! I'll get
these guys off your back.

13:29.674 --> 13:32.181
Whoa. I can
understand Mandarin.

13:32.281 --> 13:33.344
Immersion is the key.

13:33.432 --> 13:35.252
- I'm speaking English.
- Oh.

13:35.340 --> 13:36.240
Hey.

13:36.328 --> 13:42.098
<i>Speaks Chinese...</i>

13:47.623 --> 13:49.593
Fine. Just take it.

13:59.404 --> 14:02.076
So, I hope you all learned
a valuable lesson today.

14:02.164 --> 14:03.836
Lesson?
What lesson?

14:03.924 --> 14:05.626
You cut our brakes,
and we fell into a lake!

14:05.713 --> 14:07.485
Because you needed
to be reminded

14:07.573 --> 14:09.541
of the annoying things
Eddie did!

14:09.682 --> 14:11.039
Yeah, Eddie's a handful,

14:11.127 --> 14:12.672
but he also adds so much.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.969
Why won't you
acknowledge that?

14:14.057 --> 14:16.242
There's nothing
to acknowledge.

14:16.351 --> 14:18.461
But I do have something
for you to think about.

14:18.549 --> 14:20.438
While you're wasting your time
missing Eddie,

14:20.526 --> 14:21.688
he isn't missing you.

14:21.776 --> 14:22.916
How would you even know?

14:23.004 --> 14:25.102
Because he hasn't
called us yet!

14:25.564 --> 14:27.250
If he cared,
he would call!

14:27.755 --> 14:29.032
Jessica.

14:29.981 --> 14:31.516
Is Mom okay?

14:32.671 --> 14:40.133
<i>Speaks Chinese...</i>

14:48.003 --> 14:49.673
Holy moly!

14:50.242 --> 14:53.172
Your Grandma's weird example
is right.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.123
Your mom misses Eddie,
and she's expressing it

14:56.211 --> 14:58.336
as hostility towards us
and our bicycles.

14:58.547 --> 15:00.921
We have to do something to
help her get her feelings out...

15:01.131 --> 15:03.055
For her sake
and for ours.

15:04.101 --> 15:05.305
<i>Speaks Chinese...</i>

15:11.048 --> 15:12.225
- No.
- No, thanks.

15:12.313 --> 15:13.586
- Yeah.
- I'm good, thanks.

15:15.252 --> 15:16.822
Thanks again
for trying to help.

15:17.094 --> 15:18.654
What are you doing
in this part of town?

15:18.779 --> 15:20.453
This isn't a tourist area.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.750
I got separated from
my cultural exchange group,

15:22.899 --> 15:24.521
and then I blew all my money
on gifts,

15:24.758 --> 15:25.961
and then
I lost those gifts,

15:26.049 --> 15:27.479
then my ass got lost, too.

15:27.567 --> 15:28.507
Rough.

15:28.635 --> 15:30.073
Do you have a phone
I can use?

15:30.196 --> 15:32.134
I need to call my Big Auntie
so she can come pick me up.

15:32.221 --> 15:33.435
Yeah, I have a phone
at my home.

15:33.522 --> 15:35.498
But I have to
finish my route first.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.641
Hey, why don't you
help me out for the day?

15:37.741 --> 15:39.514
And then when we're done,
you can use my phone.

15:39.601 --> 15:41.180
How are you
with a knife?

15:41.662 --> 15:43.671
Not as good as I am
with a spoon!

15:47.293 --> 15:48.439
Here she comes.

15:48.527 --> 15:49.787
Follow my lead.

15:51.165 --> 15:52.395
What are you guys
doing?

15:52.581 --> 15:54.404
Drawing portraits of
your favorite times with Eddie

15:54.491 --> 15:55.391
and then kissing them?

15:55.491 --> 15:56.537
That's not a bad idea.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.380
But no. Take a seat.

16:00.212 --> 16:02.273
I picked up some
"Missing You" greeting cards

16:02.361 --> 16:03.331
to send to Eddie.

16:03.431 --> 16:04.702
I thought you might like
to sign them.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.759
You want me
to perjure myself in print?

16:06.847 --> 16:08.122
I don't miss Eddie.

16:08.286 --> 16:09.800
If one of you
committed a murder,

16:09.888 --> 16:11.505
I wouldn't take
the bloody knife

16:11.593 --> 16:14.177
and wipe it all over my body
so we can both take the fall.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.330
I don't think that's

16:15.418 --> 16:16.608
- what we're...
- You want me to drive to

16:16.695 --> 16:18.880
the store in my bloody blouse,

16:18.969 --> 16:21.509
make memorable small talk
with the cashier,

16:21.718 --> 16:23.724
and then, when I go
to write the check,

16:23.812 --> 16:27.255
accidentally pull out the knife
instead of my pen?

16:27.343 --> 16:28.933
No. No way.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.561
You wouldn't be
perjuring yourself,

16:30.661 --> 16:32.130
because you actually do
miss Eddie.

16:32.218 --> 16:33.778
I don't miss people.

16:33.904 --> 16:37.294
People are either here
or they're not here.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.513
"Missing" is just
something that happens

16:39.601 --> 16:41.052
in Mariah Carey songs.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.531
Just take a look
at the cards

16:42.631 --> 16:43.935
and see
if you feel differently.

16:44.023 --> 16:45.433
Fine.

16:49.030 --> 16:51.693
"There's a pit in my stomach
because I miss you."

16:52.871 --> 16:53.871
Clever.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.810
"Even though you're far away,

17:00.502 --> 17:03.017
I think about you
night and day."

17:06.179 --> 17:07.346
Poignant.

17:12.454 --> 17:14.971
"You can't tell on my face
that I'm sad,

17:15.070 --> 17:16.830
but I miss you."

17:19.384 --> 17:20.924
Okay, fine!

17:21.069 --> 17:22.493
I miss Eddie!

17:22.611 --> 17:25.096
I'm just like
this loose-skinned dog.

17:25.184 --> 17:27.584
The house just isn't the same
without him.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.166
Why won't he call?

17:30.321 --> 17:31.924
I just want him to call.

17:32.022 --> 17:33.072
This is hard.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.908
But it's good
that you're letting it out.

17:34.996 --> 17:38.291
Talking about Eddie will at least
make him here with us in spirit.

17:38.494 --> 17:40.244
That's so cheesy, Louis.

17:40.332 --> 17:41.353
But you're right.

17:41.441 --> 17:44.127
Ugh! Why are
cheesy things right?!

17:44.346 --> 17:47.306
Are Mariah Carey songs
built upon the truth?

17:47.821 --> 17:50.561
Is she the greatest artist
in all of music history?

17:50.771 --> 17:52.080
This is a lot to process.

17:52.168 --> 17:54.868
It's good that you learn
to be without Eddie,

17:54.956 --> 17:57.765
because in two years,
he'll be gone forever.

17:57.853 --> 17:58.987
Ma, unhelpful.

17:59.074 --> 18:01.619
Then you will have to do it
with these two.

18:01.707 --> 18:02.777
Ma!

18:02.865 --> 18:05.523
I thought we were supposed to
talk about things.

18:09.276 --> 18:10.716
Damn,
that was hard work.

18:10.804 --> 18:12.334
Hell of a sweat ring
you got going.

18:13.610 --> 18:14.958
Yep, that's a lot of work,

18:15.046 --> 18:16.691
but I almost saved up enough

18:16.791 --> 18:18.857
to open a restaurant of my own
down the block.

18:18.945 --> 18:21.804
Better and easier idea...
Just bring your food to Orlando.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.758
Your noodles are better than
anything we have in the States.

18:23.845 --> 18:24.815
You'd make a killing.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.653
Eddie, come on.
It's not that easy.

18:26.741 --> 18:27.641
Sure it is.

18:27.741 --> 18:28.833
My dad has a restaurant,

18:28.921 --> 18:30.234
and he'd totally
give you advice.

18:30.322 --> 18:33.476
Wait. Your dad owns a successful
restaurant in America?

18:33.624 --> 18:35.249
It's won
a couple regional awards.

18:35.337 --> 18:37.538
You know,
a Palmy, a Pruny...

18:37.651 --> 18:38.624
Man.

18:38.712 --> 18:40.726
I immigrated to the U.S.
three years ago.

18:40.814 --> 18:42.384
I stayed with my cousins
in Nevada,

18:42.472 --> 18:43.902
and we tried
to open up a shop.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.218
It bombed.

18:45.372 --> 18:47.929
People were like,
"Why is my spaghetti in soup?"

18:48.037 --> 18:49.077
Fools.

18:49.165 --> 18:51.913
Succeeding the way
your parents did is very hard.

18:52.225 --> 18:53.238
Didn't they tell you?

18:53.331 --> 18:54.474
They did,
but I thought

18:54.562 --> 18:55.860
they were just doing
that "back in my day" thing.

18:55.947 --> 18:58.593
You know, "Back in my day,
there was no hand sanitizer.

18:58.687 --> 18:59.929
We just
boiled our hands."

19:00.017 --> 19:01.087
Dude!

19:01.261 --> 19:02.401
Look at you.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.320
You come here
on a cultural exchange,

19:04.408 --> 19:07.030
which is the most sheltered
version of visiting a country,

19:07.118 --> 19:09.335
and you end up broke, lost,

19:09.423 --> 19:11.718
and clutching a crab backpack
for comfort.

19:13.392 --> 19:15.603
It's no joke
what your parents pulled off.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.543
Anyway...

19:20.683 --> 19:22.140
you should call
your Big Auntie.

19:30.201 --> 19:31.327
Hello?

19:31.439 --> 19:33.460
- Hey, Mom.
- Eddie!

19:34.121 --> 19:36.644
I'm... somewhat excited
you called.

19:36.732 --> 19:39.302
I'm like a 5 on a scale of 10
in excitement.

19:39.481 --> 19:41.677
No, we're at a 10.

19:41.765 --> 19:42.581
- How's it going out there?
- Hey, Dad.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.430
Let's just say it's more
than I ever expected.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.687
You went clubbing,
didn't you?

19:45.775 --> 19:47.375
Did you go
to Diablo Yang's?

19:47.470 --> 19:48.900
Anything goes
on that dance floor.

19:49.009 --> 19:50.519
I'm pretty sure
that's a library now.

19:50.759 --> 19:51.819
Oh, what a waste.

19:51.914 --> 19:52.814
Anyway, I'm just calling

19:52.902 --> 19:53.851
to tell you guys I'm sorry.

19:53.939 --> 19:55.640
I should've respected
your advice.

19:56.304 --> 19:57.468
Who is this?

19:57.556 --> 19:58.999
No, I'm serious, Mom.

19:59.087 --> 20:00.257
I've got next-level respect

20:00.345 --> 20:02.075
for your struggle
as immigrants to America.

20:02.531 --> 20:03.501
Hmm.

20:03.601 --> 20:04.904
That means a lot, son.

20:04.992 --> 20:07.121
Wait. Why do you have
a newfound respect?

20:07.209 --> 20:07.971
Are you in trouble?

20:08.071 --> 20:09.274
No, I'm fine.

20:09.470 --> 20:10.800
I made
some cool-ass friends here,

20:10.888 --> 20:12.288
including this one guy
named Willie.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.852
He makes the best noodles.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.710
Wait, wait.
Are you calling your parents?

20:15.926 --> 20:17.496
That's long-distance, man!

20:17.584 --> 20:18.423
What are you doing?!

20:18.511 --> 20:20.612
We spent hours on a kissable
drawing to cheer Mommy up,

20:20.699 --> 20:22.191
and just when we're
about to show it to her,

20:22.278 --> 20:23.718
Eddie calls
and ruins it.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.601
Classic Eddie...
Such a wild card.

20:26.735 --> 20:28.165
God, I've missed him.

20:29.689 --> 20:30.697
Hey, Eddie!

20:30.785 --> 20:31.855
Guess what.

20:31.943 --> 20:33.923
Grandma has tattoos
of the cast of "Cheers."

20:34.061 --> 20:36.101
Rhea Perlman
is on her lower back.

20:38.378 --> 20:39.738
So, what else
is going on?

20:46.714 --> 20:48.284
I'll go first.
Here's my Eddie.

20:48.479 --> 20:50.893
Yo,
I listened to this one rapper,

20:50.981 --> 20:51.906
and he's my favorite.

20:51.994 --> 20:53.408
And then I listened
to this other rapper,

20:53.495 --> 20:54.565
and he's just as good.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.683
What do I do?!

20:57.253 --> 20:58.114
Yo, Pops,

20:58.202 --> 21:00.173
I got a new dish
you gotta put on the menu.

21:00.261 --> 21:02.591
It's cheese, cantaloupe,
salmon, pecans,

21:02.679 --> 21:04.241
horseradish,
and Thousand Island

21:04.329 --> 21:06.283
blended and served
in a basketball shoe.

21:06.371 --> 21:07.941
Also, I need Friday off.

21:09.217 --> 21:10.684
I say words too fast.
I say words too fast.

21:10.771 --> 21:11.914
What am I saying?
I say words too fast.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.681
I say words too fast.
I say words too fast.

21:13.771 --> 21:14.689
What am I saying?
I say words too fast.

21:14.777 --> 21:16.407
It almost feels
like he's here.

21:16.495 --> 21:18.965
Hi, Eddie.
How are you today?

21:19.099 --> 21:20.099
Frustrated.

21:20.187 --> 21:22.665
I feel like Mom's controlling
everything I do!
