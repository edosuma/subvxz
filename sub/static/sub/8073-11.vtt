00:03.204 --> 00:05.473
[theme music]

00:08.909 --> 00:13.013
I don't smell the commingled
scents of sweat and Jean Nate.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.783
Can I assume that
Roseanne's not in today?

00:15.816 --> 00:16.684
Nope.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.018
She's at home.

00:18.052 --> 00:18.919
Good.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.254
Can I have a word with you?

00:20.288 --> 00:22.290
I need someone with
impeccable taste.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.126
And I can tell by that paw
print jumpsuit of yours

00:25.159 --> 00:27.195
that you're my woman.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.962
It has a matching cape.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.964
Mm hm, I'll bet it does.

00:30.998 --> 00:31.865
Here.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.302
Try this.

00:34.335 --> 00:38.106
I found a way of cooking the
loose meat into an omelette.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.641
It's sort of like an
egg and meat sandwich.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.975
Mm.
Delicious.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.244
Mm hm.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.645
Thinking of adding
it to the menu?

00:44.678 --> 00:46.447
Well, I would,
except that, you know,

00:46.480 --> 00:50.851
eggs aren't exactly the
best lunchtime fare.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.053
No, they're better
for breakfast.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.055
Wait a minute!

00:55.089 --> 00:58.092
Are you suggesting that we
open the diner for breakfast,

00:58.126 --> 01:00.361
thereby expanding
our menu and drawing

01:00.394 --> 01:02.696
in a whole new customer base?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.432
I love it.

01:04.465 --> 01:08.236
Well, it was just
a-- just a thought.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.338
No, no, Leon.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.772
Rosanne won't want
to do breakfast.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.441
I once suggested we
expand the hours,

01:13.474 --> 01:14.575
and she thought it was dumb.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.278
She called you dumb, Jackie?

01:17.311 --> 01:19.880
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.349
Well, she didn't
say that I was dumb.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.884
She said that my idea was--

01:23.917 --> 01:25.886
well, it sounded different
the way she said it.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.854
Uh huh.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.356
Well, you know, of
course, we could

01:28.389 --> 01:32.926
stick with Roseanne's plan of
just serving lunch and dinner.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.162
And I guess we
could afford health

01:34.195 --> 01:35.729
insurance in about two years.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.867
Gosh, I hope you can
hold it in till then.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.802
Well, I like the
breakfast idea.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.671
I say we vote yes.
- Well, wait a--

01:43.704 --> 01:46.274
We can't vote without
Roseanne here.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.177
That breakfast idea
could be a big disaster.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.313
Nancy's idea a disaster.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.814
Don't feel bad, kid.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.116
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.686
Jackie, I don't
have ideas often.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.788
I'm proud of this one.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.424
You know, Jackie, I'm sure
it's easier having Roseanne

02:03.457 --> 02:06.594
make all your decisions for
you, but eventually you're

02:06.627 --> 02:08.196
going to have to cut the cord.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.631
Or else you and the
kid and Roseanne

02:10.664 --> 02:12.200
are going to look like
mountain climbers.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.334
Hey!

02:13.367 --> 02:15.536
Now, Roseanne does
not control me.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.671
Well, then, let's
vote on breakfast.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.672
I vote yes.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.573
Yes!

02:19.607 --> 02:21.242
I vote OK.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.711
I got chills!

02:23.744 --> 02:25.479
We open Monday at 6:00 AM.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.380
Well, wait a minute.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.516
Who's going to tell Roseanne?

02:28.549 --> 02:30.083
Well, it was Nancy's idea.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.555
Good luck, Nance.

02:37.658 --> 02:42.029
[theme music]

03:17.498 --> 03:19.867
[laughs]

03:25.939 --> 03:28.041
Hey.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.209
Sorry those weren't done.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.511
That's OK, Dan.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.313
I know there wasn't
time to do the dishes

03:32.346 --> 03:34.648
and fall asleep in a
puddle of your own drool.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.653
DJ said he'd do them
after his homework.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.689
Now, Dan, I think
the dishes should

03:41.722 --> 03:43.291
come before the homework.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.725
If he doesn't learn
how to do dishes,

03:44.758 --> 03:48.629
he'll never get a job
after high school.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.597
Honey, you're tired.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.798
Why don't you call
Leon and tell him

03:50.831 --> 03:52.132
you're not going to work today?

03:52.165 --> 03:53.801
I can't.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.537
Leon on is like, on to me.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.307
He knows that I control
the restaurant, you know.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.942
So he's trying to stage
this bloodless coup

04:01.975 --> 04:03.411
down there to oust me.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.213
And he knows that I know.

04:06.246 --> 04:11.285
So he's trying to get rid of
me before I can get rid of him.

04:11.319 --> 04:15.289
Boy, does he sound paranoid.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.858
You know, he thinks he's
so nifty because he turned

04:17.891 --> 04:20.060
Jackie and Nancy against me.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.194
You know, well, I broke them.

04:21.228 --> 04:24.998
Anybody can ride them.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.200
I'm gonna go.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.336
No, no, no.

04:28.369 --> 04:32.540
You're gonna drive DJ to
his basketball practice.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.442
DJ, come down here!

04:34.475 --> 04:35.443
Wrong, Roseanne.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.010
DJ's basketball
practice is Wednesday.

04:37.044 --> 04:37.911
Uh uh.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.079
It's on Tuesday.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.549
I think I know this.

04:41.582 --> 04:45.386
DJ, is basketball on
Tuesday or Wednesday?

04:45.419 --> 04:46.454
Tuesday.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.755
Duh!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.090
I don't play basketball.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.559
I quit at the end
of last season.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.363
Duh!

04:59.467 --> 05:01.435
Face it, Dan, we're
working so much we hardly

05:01.469 --> 05:03.103
know our kid at all anymore.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.174
I think I'm forgetting
what DJ stands for.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.477
Got to go.

05:09.510 --> 05:14.548
So, kid, what's
new in your life,

05:14.582 --> 05:16.450
anyway, that I don't know about?

05:16.484 --> 05:17.284
I got married.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.222
Where'd you park your car?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.290
What do you mean?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.793
I checked it with the valet.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.794
I'm serious, Roseann.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.462
It's not in the driveway.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.663
Did you leave your
keys in the car?

05:29.697 --> 05:32.099
What do you mean did I
leave the keys in the car?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.233
They're not
hanging on the hook.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.002
Well, it don't matter
what I do with my keys

05:35.035 --> 05:36.336
because I know put the club on.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.605
Where'd you leave
the key to the club?

05:41.609 --> 05:42.843
(ACCUSATORY) You
didn't do the dishes!

05:52.720 --> 05:55.523
Hey, my breakfast idea brought
in a whole new customer base.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.657
Right.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.959
They're all over 35, and
they all want a sammich.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.634
Roseanne, we're making
really good money.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.069
Yeah, but it isn't supposed
to be about the money.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.170
Don't you remember the old days?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.473
It was about us having
our own business

06:12.506 --> 06:15.843
that we run our own way without
no man telling us what to do.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.011
Roseanne, you ran the place.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.913
You told us what to do.

06:19.947 --> 06:20.814
What happened to that?

06:23.484 --> 06:24.885
I think you're
being hard on Leon.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.854
he's a really good organizer.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.823
Plus, he tells us when
we've done a good job.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.925
Well, you do do a
good job-- both of you.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.294
You're both great workers.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.863
Then why don't
you ever say it?

06:35.896 --> 06:39.633
Cause it's a big fat lie!

06:39.667 --> 06:42.836
At least I'm honest.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.171
Good morning, ladies.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.373
Could you please
not be so patronizing?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.775
We are not ladies.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.976
We are women.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.544
And I'm not patronizing.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.481
I'm condescending.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.082
Nancy, when you have a
second I want to show you

06:55.115 --> 06:56.850
the prototype for the uniform.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.385
The uniform?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.287
Now, Roseanne.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.889
I thought we agreed
we wasn't going to wear

07:01.922 --> 07:03.591
them humiliating things.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.325
Well, when I was talking
to Leon the other day,

07:05.358 --> 07:07.528
I came up with a great
idea that the uniforms

07:07.561 --> 07:11.665
would make us stand out
from the customers more.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.501
So why would we
want to do that?

07:13.534 --> 07:18.639
Then they know who to go to
to bring them more stuff!

07:18.672 --> 07:20.340
Well, we thought
it was a good idea

07:20.373 --> 07:22.843
when we voted on it yesterday.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.512
I thought you said
you wasn't gonna vote

07:24.545 --> 07:25.846
on nothing when I ain't here.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.214
Well, first we
voted on whether

07:27.247 --> 07:28.315
or not to vote without you.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.850
And I voted no!

07:29.883 --> 07:31.184
But I lost.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.753
So then we voted on whether
or not to have the uniforms.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.654
Yeah.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.822
How'd you vote on that?

07:34.855 --> 07:35.723
That was a secret ballot.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.826
I can't tell you that.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.529
We also voted that the
restaurant's official bird

07:41.562 --> 07:44.031
should be the toucan.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.799
Would you like to see
the bird I voted for?

07:54.241 --> 07:56.176
What's going on, Dan?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.545
Hey, Rosie.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.347
The cops found the car in a
ditch a couple of blocks away.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.750
What do we got, boys?

08:02.783 --> 08:04.151
Quite a bit of damage.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.519
Passenger door was smashed in.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.420
The fender was all
dented, busted headlight.

08:07.454 --> 08:11.291
Well, that sounds
like our car, all right.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.726
Phone in a 1099?

08:12.760 --> 08:16.129
1099, and we called for a
backup and a possible 1057.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.532
Good man.

08:18.566 --> 08:22.302
Did you have anything of
value that should be reported?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.738
Uh-- yeah, as
a matter of fact.

08:24.772 --> 08:30.878
We just bought a brand new,
really expensive stereo system.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.180
What kind was it?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.815
A uh--

08:34.848 --> 08:37.450
Pfulegaler.

08:37.484 --> 08:42.623
Uh, P-F and two
dots over the U.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.057
Well, there is some good news.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.726
We were patrolling
around the vicinity

08:45.759 --> 08:47.628
and found a witness
who saw the guy.

08:47.661 --> 08:51.264
He describes him as a juvenile
Caucasian, dark hair, dark

08:51.298 --> 08:53.400
eyes, resembling Eddie Munster.

08:53.433 --> 08:58.872
[chuckles]

08:58.906 --> 09:01.208
I got to get
off the phone now.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.051
I was just going
down the street.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.452
George dared me.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.756
Then I got stuck in the
mud and couldn't get out.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.625
So you come all the way
home, and you just got to bed,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.292
and you don't even
tell us about it?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.127
I forgot.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.899
I think we can handle
things from here, guys.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.867
No, no!

09:26.900 --> 09:29.737
Don't leave me alone with them!

09:29.770 --> 09:31.905
You really blew
it this time, DJ!

09:31.939 --> 09:33.373
You could have had
a horrible accident!

09:33.406 --> 09:34.374
Nothing happened.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.275
Nothing happened?

09:35.308 --> 09:36.343
You stole a car!

09:36.376 --> 09:38.578
You could have gotten
yourself killed!

09:38.612 --> 09:40.380
How stupid are you, anyway?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.015
What were you thinking about?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.450
You think it's
funny or something?

09:43.483 --> 09:44.685
Answer me!
- Let me handle this.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.753
No!
You had your turn.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.920
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.288
That is supposed
to mean that if I'm

09:48.321 --> 09:50.590
not around him every minute,
he's going to end up in prison!

09:50.624 --> 09:51.959
- Shut up and leave me alone!
- No!

09:51.992 --> 09:52.926
I'm not done with you!

09:52.960 --> 09:53.927
[smack, smack]
- Ow!

09:53.961 --> 09:54.928
Ow!
Stop!

09:54.962 --> 09:55.829
Roseanne!

09:55.863 --> 09:56.664
Leave me alone!

10:00.934 --> 10:01.735
Honey--

10:04.838 --> 10:07.240
[inaudible]

10:11.311 --> 10:13.346
Look, Roseanne, what
you just did in there,

10:13.380 --> 10:14.414
it's not that big a deal.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.315
Yes, it is!

10:15.348 --> 10:16.449
You're not helping, Dan.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.517
Look, I know what you feel like.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.686
You have got to talk about this.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.921
Hey, she doesn't
need you making

10:20.954 --> 10:21.855
something out of nothing!

10:21.889 --> 10:23.090
You didn't grow
up in our house!

10:23.123 --> 10:23.991
This is different!

10:24.024 --> 10:25.225
The kid had it coming!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.293
He could have killed himself!

10:26.326 --> 10:27.260
She was out of control!

10:27.294 --> 10:29.496
It was just like Dad!

10:29.529 --> 10:34.067
Why don't you both just
shut up and leave me alone!

10:34.101 --> 10:34.902
You heard her.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.510
I got some stuff to do.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.986
[door slam]

11:43.937 --> 11:46.273
Telling her to
ignore what she did

11:46.306 --> 11:47.607
isn't going to make
her feel any better.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.743
Oh, but calling her
a child beater is.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.644
You just don't get it, Dan.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.915
I am so sick of
hearing I don't get it!

11:54.948 --> 11:58.085
Look, I know your
father was a jerk.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.953
But that's got nothing to
do with what's going on--

11:59.987 --> 12:01.654
That has everything
to do with it!

12:01.688 --> 12:03.290
These patterns repeat!

12:03.323 --> 12:04.624
Well, then you
better look out,

12:04.657 --> 12:06.894
because my father used to
love to hit his sister-in-law.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.767
I can't even talk to you.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.469
Look, look, look.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.106
She did it because she's
stressed out from work.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.175
And it would help if you
didn't always vote against her!

12:22.209 --> 12:23.276
I'm not voting against her.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.611
I'm voting for my baby.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.313
Leon's making us a lot
of money down there.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.948
And if you're so worried
about her stress,

12:27.981 --> 12:30.851
why don't you help out more?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.085
I help out a lot around here!

12:32.119 --> 12:32.920
How?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.991
You know how I'm
gonna help her?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.193
By throwing you
out of the house!

12:40.227 --> 12:41.194
Too late!

12:41.228 --> 12:42.295
She already did!

12:55.008 --> 12:56.944
[door knock]

12:56.977 --> 12:57.878
Hang on.

13:03.116 --> 13:03.917
Hey, Leon.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.290
Doing the books?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.992
Yes, Dan.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.562
Trying to make conversation?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.630
Actually, I cam to
talk about Roseanne.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.799
No, no, I don't think so.

13:19.833 --> 13:20.700
Why not?

13:20.733 --> 13:22.535
What's the matter?

13:22.569 --> 13:27.040
Well, you're a
rather large man, Dan.

13:27.074 --> 13:31.244
And if we discuss your wife,
I can either say nice things,

13:31.278 --> 13:36.884
or I can be honest and
get my arms torn off.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.518
Don't worry, Leon.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.753
I can sympathize with you.

13:40.787 --> 13:44.191
Roseanne can be a little
difficult. Aw, hell.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.759
She idles at difficult.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.997
Dan, you have no idea
how loudly I can scream.

13:50.030 --> 13:50.830
Look, Leon.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.903
She is really stressed out.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.238
And she just needs to spend
a little more time at home.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.606
But for some reason,
she doesn't think

13:59.639 --> 14:00.941
she can talk to you about it.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.076
Oh, that's ridiculous.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.145
I told her you'd understand.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.713
So if you just cut
her a little slack,

14:06.746 --> 14:08.848
it will make life
easier for everybody.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.317
Especially me.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.251
Well I'd be happy to.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.219
In fact, you know what?

14:12.252 --> 14:14.554
I'm going to go you
one better, Dan.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.722
How much to buy her out?

14:15.755 --> 14:16.623
[chuckles]

14:16.656 --> 14:18.091
I'm serious.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.092
What?

14:19.126 --> 14:21.228
Come on, Jackie
and Nancy are already

14:21.261 --> 14:22.595
on board with
everything I'm doing

14:22.629 --> 14:26.066
around here because I can make
a success out of this place.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.768
Leon, come on.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.003
Roseanne started this place.

14:30.037 --> 14:30.938
This is her dream.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.706
I have a dream too.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.343
And it's to not let
her dream go bankrupt.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.310
See, I knew it.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.211
I knew it.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.846
You are going to hurt me.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.248
Worse.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.882
For weeks, I've been
telling her that she's

14:42.916 --> 14:44.184
just paranoid about you.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.385
But I'm through defending you.

14:45.418 --> 14:49.022
From now on, you fight
your battles on your own.

14:49.056 --> 14:49.856
Against Roseanne.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.895
May god have mercy on your soul.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.448
DJ!

15:15.482 --> 15:16.883
Come down here!

15:22.555 --> 15:23.356
(SULLEN) What?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.495
Well, I thought
maybe you might

15:28.528 --> 15:31.999
want to spoil your dinner.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.267
No.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.869
Would you mind
watching if I spoil mine?

15:36.903 --> 15:39.406
Do I have to?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.307
Yeah.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.174
Yeah, you do.

15:45.278 --> 15:50.617
I think we should-- you
know-- talk about stuff.

15:50.650 --> 15:55.022
You know, cause uh--
today was really bad.

15:58.091 --> 15:58.891
Hm.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.632
I'm really sorry
that I hit you, DJ.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.367
I mean, it was totally wrong.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.401
I never should have done that.

16:08.435 --> 16:12.772
And I am so mad at
myself for doing it.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.873
I wanna go upstairs.

16:13.906 --> 16:14.707
No.

16:17.577 --> 16:23.483
You can't go upstairs
until we talk this all out.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.887
Um-- I know how you're feeling.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.592
And I know you're feeling
mad and, you know,

16:32.625 --> 16:35.962
kind of embarrassed.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.831
Wrong.

16:38.865 --> 16:45.572
Well, that's the way that I
used to feel when I got hit.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.841
Who hit you?

16:48.875 --> 16:52.679
Your grandpa hit me.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.981
A lot.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.217
What did you do wrong?

16:57.250 --> 17:00.987
I mean, I breathed
or something.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.822
Do you hate him?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.362
Yeah, sometimes.

17:09.396 --> 17:13.533
You know, cause
the worst thing was

17:13.566 --> 17:19.372
that he never ever said he was
sorry for any of it, you know.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.008
I don't want you to hate me, DJ.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.078
I'm really sorry that I hit you.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.281
No matter what, I'm never
gonna hit you again, ever.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.716
No matter what I do?

17:29.749 --> 17:30.683
No matter what you do.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.120
Ever.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.589
I'm sorry you got hit.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.891
I'm sorry you got hit too.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.428
I mean, big sorry.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.964
Like, right now would be
a great time to ask me

17:44.997 --> 17:46.999
for a new puppy kind of sorry.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.615
Sit down there now.

18:02.649 --> 18:06.586
We still have to talk about
this little prank you pulled.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.588
I though we were done.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.090
DJ, you stole a car!

18:11.124 --> 18:14.827
You've got to take the
consequences for that.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.896
Man.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.298
You know what?

18:18.331 --> 18:19.799
I think you're trying to tell me
something with all this stuff.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.100
You know, I think
you're trying to tell

18:21.134 --> 18:22.935
me that I'm not spending
enough time with you lately.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.604
No, I wasn't.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.672
Well, I think you were.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.207
And that's why tomorrow
I'm going to go in

18:27.240 --> 18:28.608
and I'm going to
rearrange everything,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.110
and I'm gonna make sure that I
have more time here with you.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.011
But you can't.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.146
You work.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.881
So?

18:34.914 --> 18:38.918
Sometimes you gotta trade
what's important for what's

18:38.951 --> 18:40.353
more important, you know.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.590
And I'm going to make sure
that I have a lot of time

18:43.623 --> 18:44.657
to spend with you, DJ.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.227
I'm gonna be here all the time.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.528
Is that my punishment?

18:54.501 --> 18:58.238
You are a funny,
funny little man, DJ.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.472
Funny little man.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.784
Afternoon, people.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.220
That is a safe term, isn't it?

19:13.253 --> 19:15.322
I wouldn't want to
offend you ladies.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.923
And I wouldn't
want to offend you,

19:16.956 --> 19:19.125
either, you balding
albino idiot.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.197
Let me know when
I cross the line.

19:24.231 --> 19:27.434
I though you were going to
try spending more time at home.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.401
Oh, I was.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.669
But me and Dan talked about it.

19:29.702 --> 19:33.573
We thought you might like that.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.941
Oh, slave boy!

19:41.348 --> 19:42.682
What's he doing here?

19:42.715 --> 19:44.551
5 to 10, grand theft auto.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.655
He can't be here.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.257
He-- he-- he's a child.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.825
I know, but he was
tried as an adult.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.427
And his punishment
is that he's going

19:54.461 --> 19:55.662
to help me around
the diner here so I

19:55.695 --> 19:57.129
have more time to bother you.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.770
Well, you can't do this,
Roseanne, because a child

20:03.803 --> 20:05.638
cannot work in this restaurant.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.006
Too late.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.477
We took a vote
while you were out.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.112
Get to work, DJ.

20:13.145 --> 20:20.086
[sloshing water]

20:20.119 --> 20:20.920
I hate you!

20:27.960 --> 20:30.463
You know what's so great, DJ?

20:30.497 --> 20:32.332
We're not just spending
a lot of time together.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.301
We're spending
quality time together.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.578
OK.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.913
This Conners kid
is pretty tough.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.415
He comes from a problem family.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.417
So we don't really
know what to expect.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.318
Police!

20:51.351 --> 20:52.652
We're coming in!
- Go!

20:52.685 --> 20:53.252
Go!
Go!

20:53.286 --> 20:54.287
Freeze!
Police!

20:54.321 --> 20:55.422
Hey!

20:55.455 --> 20:58.224
Why don't you leave my
kid alone, you [bleep]!!

20:58.257 --> 20:59.225
OK, lady, where is he!

20:59.258 --> 21:02.028
You're hurting my
arm, you [bleep]!!

21:02.061 --> 21:04.030
Drop the pizza, [bleep]!

21:04.063 --> 21:04.864
Drop it!

21:07.967 --> 21:08.835
DJ!

21:08.868 --> 21:10.503
It's the [bleep] cops!

21:10.537 --> 21:11.404
Get down here.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.306
DJ!

21:13.340 --> 21:14.273
The cops are here!

21:14.307 --> 21:17.209
Get your [bleep] [inaudible]!

21:17.243 --> 21:18.110
Where is he!

21:18.144 --> 21:19.546
Went out the window!

21:19.579 --> 21:20.980
[tires screeching]

21:21.013 --> 21:24.784
[bleep] He took our car!

21:24.817 --> 21:26.185
[police siren]

21:26.218 --> 21:28.855
And you left the keys in it,
didn't you, [bleep] for brains.

21:32.224 --> 21:35.795
[theme music]
