04:17.966 --> 04:19.257
How long?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.803
A day, maybe two.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.533
They're away and gone, Rob,
and the beasts sold.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.744
There's a wee glen on
the other side of Ben Duh.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.875
If I were tinkers with a two-day start,
I'd lie out there and kill me some meat.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.670
We'd not get there
before dark, Rob.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.755
Not stood here,
we won't.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.048
You can smell them
through the meat.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.091
Aye, if they fought as
strong as they smelled,

05:43.176 --> 05:44.926
we'd be in trouble.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.265
They're there right enough,
just like you said, Rob.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.522
We can rush them
when they're asleep.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.441
Ten of them to six of us.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.860
Nine.
One of them's a woman.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.030
Half of them would be dead
before they were awake.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.616
How are we going
to take them, Rob?

06:08.701 --> 06:11.453
I'll go and talk to them in the morning.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.886
I'm getting
too old for this,

06:27.970 --> 06:31.681
lying wet-arsed in the heather,
chasing other men's cattle.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.143
Come away to the Americas with me.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.563
They say there's fine acres
for the clearing in Virginia.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.192
Aye, and they'll likely be
as hard as these to sleep on.

06:45.154 --> 06:47.364
Why are you going in
to talk to them?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.616
I know one of them.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.821
Up!

07:27.905 --> 07:31.867
Get up, you bunch of
ragged-arsed tinker cow thieves!

07:38.708 --> 07:42.419
This is Robert Roy MacGregor
come to reclaim the 32 beasts

07:42.503 --> 07:46.798
stolen from His Lordship James
Graham, Marquis of Montrose.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.676
Tam Sibbald.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.970
Still at your thieving.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.516
Throw down now and I'll
spare you, all but one.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.021
There's a price to being
a leader of men, Tam.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.150
By God, MacGregor,

08:05.234 --> 08:08.487
if there's any killing to
be done, you're the first.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.991
Who do you think you are,
acting the great chief?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.828
And I know you're a bigger
thief than any of us.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.707
Aye, but if I had stolen
His Lordship's cattle,

08:20.791 --> 08:24.377
you would not have come
walking into my dreams so easy.

08:24.462 --> 08:28.089
I can call the Gregorach
and kill the half of you,

08:28.174 --> 08:30.675
or it can be between us
and nothing more.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.094
Think on it, man.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.721
Would you not rather
be dead this morning

08:34.804 --> 08:37.807
after a good hump and a
belly full of stolen beef,

08:37.892 --> 08:39.808
or would you have me
march you back to Montrose

08:39.894 --> 08:43.355
so you can shit yourself
on the gallows a month hence?

08:56.285 --> 08:57.577
Throw down! Now!

08:57.662 --> 09:00.497
And you have my word
no one else will die!

09:06.462 --> 09:07.921
Come, lads.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.132
And any man with a blade
in his hands, cut him down.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.016
Are you men,
or what are you?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.562
He killed Tam,
and you stand and live!

09:23.646 --> 09:26.565
And him as much an outlaw as any of you!

09:28.609 --> 09:31.403
No man among you!
Your mothers curse you!

09:31.487 --> 09:33.822
You're spittle!
You're leavings!

09:37.827 --> 09:40.662
Listen to me well,
and remember this,

09:41.497 --> 09:44.791
or I'm going to remember
you, every last one.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.543
When next you think
to steal cattle,

09:46.627 --> 09:49.129
have a care they're not
under my protection.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.382
But if they are, you're not
stealing from their owners.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.760
You're stealing from me,
Robert Roy MacGregor.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.555
And no man who steals
my beasts makes a profit.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.057
If you doubt me,
ask Tam Sibbald.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.023
What are you going
to do with her?

10:09.108 --> 10:12.861
Be on your way, and tell no
man you fared ill at our hands.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.362
Go on.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.840
Cut him down!
Slash him!

11:18.344 --> 11:19.552
Go on.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.028
Yeah!

11:37.113 --> 11:41.574
Ladies and gentlemen, the
winner of the contest is Guthrie!

11:43.786 --> 11:47.288
Montrose, come hotfoot
from the court to the cockpit.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.375
May I present
Archibald Cunningham.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.502
His Grace,
the Duke of Argyll.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.963
I am Your Grace's
humble servant.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.675
Another of your
likely lads?

11:58.759 --> 12:01.845
Archibald is sent me
by his mother,

12:01.929 --> 12:05.807
in the hope that our climate
might cool the fever in his blood.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.393
So, Mr. Cunningham,

12:08.477 --> 12:11.730
what are these principal sins
that distress your mother?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.565
Dice? Drink?

12:14.066 --> 12:16.317
Or are you
a buggerer of boys?

12:16.861 --> 12:19.654
It is years, Your Grace,
since I buggered a boy.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.448
And in my own defense,
I must add,

12:21.532 --> 12:23.575
I thought him a girl
at the moment of entry.

12:25.494 --> 12:29.038
What say you, Guthrie, that Archie
could not tell arse from quim?

12:29.123 --> 12:32.751
I've heard that many Englishmen
have that same difficulty.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.627
Spoken as well
as you fought.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.963
Did you see Guthrie here
at work, Mr. Cunningham?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.924
He has a fair hand with the
cleaver, it must be said.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.178
You do not think much of
our Highland tools, then?

12:43.262 --> 12:47.682
If I had to kill an ox, a claymore
would be my first choice, Your Grace.

12:49.935 --> 12:54.481
You best use a musket and
save the beast a slow dying.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.526
I would not need a
musket for you, Guthrie.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.320
Splendid!

13:00.404 --> 13:04.491
I'll wager 100 of what you
like on Guthrie and his cleaver.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.034
At odds?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.953
Now, come, James,
you're a fox. What odds?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.455
Three?
Two.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.081
English pounds.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.084
There's more of
a jingle to guineas.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.338
Guineas it is.
Excellent, excellent.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.049
A bumper of Rhenish for my
Lord Montrose and myself,

13:21.133 --> 13:24.010
and show Mr. Cunningham
what blades we have.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.395
You honor me, sir, to
serve me with your own hand.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.981
I tell you, James,

13:37.066 --> 13:40.819
I forget how much you dislike
me until I'm in your presence.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.238
So, what news at court?

13:44.114 --> 13:46.115
What else
but the succession?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.786
Our poor queen cannot find
the time to die in peace.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.498
I fear she may pass over and
leave the matter unresolved.

13:53.582 --> 13:57.126
Would that she had seen a child of
hers live to comfort the kingdom.

13:57.211 --> 14:00.338
Aye. One might have hoped that
a field so regularly ploughed

14:00.422 --> 14:03.174
might have yielded
one good crop.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.178
In truth, I have seen healthier
graveyards than that woman's womb.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.000
Come on!

14:44.717 --> 14:48.678
I am asked continually on what side
Your Grace will declare himself.

14:49.471 --> 14:53.349
Where Argyll goes, the
path must be firm and broad.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.395
And now all watch
to see which way to jump.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.106
One cannot go
to the closet

15:00.190 --> 15:03.192
but what some adherent to
James is praising your pish.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.176
And I confess to a certain
weariness in this whole issue,

15:28.260 --> 15:31.512
and look for the light of
Your Grace to give some lead.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.097
And all I could answer,
in honesty,

15:33.182 --> 15:37.018
was that it would be the one
most inclined to his own benefit.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.939
Damn it, man. But you talk too
much. Can you not tend to your wager?

15:42.858 --> 15:45.068
Argyll,
my wager is well won.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.118
Damn it, Guthrie!

16:36.912 --> 16:41.082
Is it not enough that you're beaten,
but you must turn backstabber?

16:44.211 --> 16:47.422
My factor will call upon
Your Grace's factor.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.874
Well done, Rob, man.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.697
Cut out another
of the cattle.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.574
If the tinkers ate one,
they could have eaten two.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.243
Montrose will charge you, nonetheless.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.830
I'm weary of seeing children
hungry and old folk cold.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.541
It'll take more than
a cow to fix that, Rob.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.086
Aye. Well, you'll be in the
Americas, living off the fat,

18:08.170 --> 18:09.962
so it won't worry you.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.673
Will you have some broth,
Rob? No, Coll. I'm for home.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.800
God bless you, Rob.

18:13.884 --> 18:18.471
And then Rob just walks in among
them, his sword still in its sheath,

18:19.681 --> 18:23.184
And says, "Up. Get up, you
bunch of ragged-arsed... "

18:23.268 --> 18:24.268
Hello, Rob.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.728
Hello, Rob!

18:26.230 --> 18:29.107
"Get up, you bunch of
ragged-arsed tinker cow thieves!"

18:29.191 --> 18:31.651
And Rob up to him
and says,

18:31.735 --> 18:36.072
"Tell your crew to lay down
and I'll only cut your throat,

18:36.156 --> 18:37.198
"else I'll call my men. "

18:37.282 --> 18:39.659
And we're all there.
We are ready.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.367
Get up, boy.
Come on.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.829
Go on. Get.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.147
I dreamed
a selkie came.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.660
And what did he do
to you, your selkie?

20:47.829 --> 20:50.539
You wakened me
before the best of it.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.670
But he would have
ravished me for certain.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.553
How do you know
you're awake, wife?

21:58.692 --> 22:01.152
Mr. Killearn.
I'm on my way.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.655
Aye. Well on the way,
I'd venture.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.159
Let me be, Mr. Killearn. You'll
wake him. Don't, Mr. Killearn!

22:08.243 --> 22:12.079
I'm sure the young master has
you nicely greased, does he not?

22:12.873 --> 22:16.000
Betty, you'd hardly
feel me going in.

22:36.396 --> 22:39.940
A wee whiff of quim in the
morning, Mr. Cunningham, sir.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.363
Just the thing
to clear your head.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.537
Mr. Cunningham, I hope
I'm not disturbing you.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.999
Of course you're bloody
well disturbing me.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.546
Do you think
I want to wake up

23:02.631 --> 23:06.300
and find some great smelly
Scotchman staring down at me?

23:19.815 --> 23:21.732
What are you doing here?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.151
I wanted to tell you that
some of the local trades people

23:24.236 --> 23:27.154
have been pressing
for payment on your debt.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.532
And you woke me
to tell me that?

23:29.616 --> 23:34.245
A thousand apologies, Mr. Cunningham,
but they've also writ to His Lordship.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.793
Damn it, man.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.755
I but recently earned
His Lordship 200 guineas.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.509
What are the complaints of a
few tradesmen for such services?

23:50.762 --> 23:52.096
This country does
not agree with me.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.349
I cannot wait to be
out of the damnable place.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.437
The sentiments of
a great many of us, sir.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.982
Would you like me to take
away your chamber pot?

24:04.317 --> 24:07.319
I know many a Scotsman would be
glad of this on a cold morning.

24:07.404 --> 24:11.157
It's almost pure spirit, and
I'm no judge of a pint of pish.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.621
Come back.
Come here!

24:18.457 --> 24:21.083
I killed Tam Sibbald
yesterday morning.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.254
We played ball
once at Crieff market.

24:25.338 --> 24:29.008
I remember shouting, "Well
done, Tam," when he made a run.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.636
And there he was, hung on
the end of my dirk like meat.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.804
Aye.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.265
Well, likely
it was necessary.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.435
Aye, it was. Necessary
enough to save worse.

24:40.353 --> 24:43.355
But those tinkers weren't
all born broken men, Mary.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.691
Some of them
had kin and clan.

24:46.401 --> 24:49.737
They made me fear I might have come
across one of our own among them.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.906
MacGregors are not tinkers.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.493
But a hard winter or
two away, some of us...

24:57.037 --> 24:59.246
What's gnawing on you,
Robert?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.959
I've made up my mind to
borrow money from Montrose

25:04.044 --> 25:07.046
to buy cattle at Crieff
market and sell at Carlisle.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.797
How much money?

25:08.882 --> 25:10.090
£1,000.

25:11.593 --> 25:16.013
Believe me, Mary, it will turn profit.
£6 in Crieff is £12 in Carlisle.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.473
And I know cattle.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.517
I can drive them faster
and deliver them fatter

25:19.601 --> 25:21.852
than any man
in the kingdom.

25:21.937 --> 25:25.356
And why would the Marquis of
Montrose lend a MacGregor £1,000?

25:25.440 --> 25:28.984
For profit, what else? It's an
investment as much as a loan.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.780
So it's business partners you
are now, you and the Marquis.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.407
Keep that tongue
for your boys, woman.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.619
I didn't tell you my
mind to be flayed for it.

25:42.582 --> 25:46.126
You know I love the bones
of you, Robert MacGregor.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.088
But you take too much to
heart that cannot be helped.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.839
It must be helped.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.134
All right,

25:55.095 --> 25:56.637
but not today.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.647
I got yous.
I got the two of yous!

26:07.107 --> 26:08.857
Got the two of yous!

26:11.903 --> 26:13.153
Move on.

26:14.739 --> 26:18.826
Father, will MacGregors
ever be kings again?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.830
All men with honor
are kings,

26:23.748 --> 26:25.833
but not all kings
have honor.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.459
What is honor?

26:28.670 --> 26:30.087
Honor is

26:33.049 --> 26:36.385
what no man can give you,
and none can take away.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.056
Honor is a man's gift
to himself.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.267
Do women have it?

26:44.185 --> 26:46.812
Women are
the heart of honor,

26:46.896 --> 26:49.523
and we cherish and protect it in them.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.402
You must never mistreat
a woman or malign a man,

26:53.486 --> 26:55.696
nor stand by
and see another do so.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.073
How do you know
if you have it?

26:59.701 --> 27:02.328
Never worry on
the getting of it.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.872
It grows in you
and speaks to you.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.043
All you need do is listen.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.797
All right, lads,
enough of the finer things.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.758
You've animals to tend
to and water to haul.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.384
Away with you.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.804
Your mother and me
will be down directly.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.932
Take the basket.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.730
Come on! I'll race you down the hill.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.111
Do you know how fine you
are to me, Mary MacGregor?

27:36.529 --> 27:37.738
So fine.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.371
Is that why
you sent them away?

27:46.289 --> 27:48.290
To tell me
how fine I am?

27:51.419 --> 27:57.299
Or did you want to make a silk
purse out of my sow's ear again?

27:59.427 --> 28:01.428
What a wanton I'm wed to.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.268
You know what the old wives
say about these standing stones?

28:08.687 --> 28:09.770
No.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.398
What do the old wives say,
old wife?

28:14.484 --> 28:15.859
Come here.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.861
What do they say?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.955
So, what do they say?

28:30.917 --> 28:33.293
They say the stones
make men hard,

28:35.338 --> 28:37.005
and women fertile.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.178
We've no need of them,
you and me.

28:59.821 --> 29:03.240
You know how fine you are
to me, Robert MacGregor?

29:45.533 --> 29:48.494
This tailor in Glasgow

29:48.578 --> 29:50.746
to whom you owe £87

29:50.830 --> 29:53.624
extended this credit
because you were my guest?

29:53.708 --> 29:58.462
Or as you prefer to frame it,
"a member of my household"?

29:58.546 --> 30:02.299
I can assure Your Lordship I
have in no manner indebted him.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.468
And now Killearn
tells me

30:04.552 --> 30:07.679
that you are saddling
one of my serving wenches.

30:09.015 --> 30:13.602
Damn it, sir! Your mother did not send
you to me to debauch innocent girls.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.772
I regret that I have
so offended Your Lordship.

30:16.856 --> 30:19.399
By your leave,
I will remove myself.

30:22.070 --> 30:26.573
And to where,
might I ask?

30:29.369 --> 30:31.829
You are penniless.
You have no mount.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.539
You know no one.

30:34.749 --> 30:37.417
To where will you
remove yourself?

30:39.671 --> 30:40.796
Have you some notion

30:40.880 --> 30:44.424
of presenting yourself
at the Duke of Argyll's door,

30:44.509 --> 30:47.719
and soliciting his patronage
as his new champion?

30:49.347 --> 30:52.099
I am Your Lordship's
to command.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.186
Remember your place, sir!

30:58.690 --> 31:00.816
That's all I ask
of any man.

31:04.487 --> 31:05.946
What is next?

31:06.322 --> 31:08.073
MacGregor, my lord.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.498
You may go, Archibald.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.567
You bear no arms?

31:43.651 --> 31:46.904
I hadn't planned on demanding
terms at sword point.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.660
Robert MacGregor of
Craigrostan, my lord.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.831
So, MacGregor,

31:59.208 --> 32:02.502
I knew your father, an
able man, if not a wise one.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.255
Have you taken on
his mantle?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.215
As best I may,
my lord.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.138
So, how many men
are you master of?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.015
Master of none,
my lord,

32:15.099 --> 32:18.560
but some 200 souls
live close by Craigrostan,

32:18.645 --> 32:20.062
and are in my care.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.105
But you are a prophet
and provider to them,

32:22.190 --> 32:23.732
is that not so?

32:24.359 --> 32:26.109
What I can, I do.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.404
It is no great matter compared
to Your Lordship's world.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.451
To know one's place, MacGregor,
in the order of things

32:34.535 --> 32:36.328
is a great blessing.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.540
And what terms, Killearn?
A fifth, my lord.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.417
A fifth, you say?

32:42.502 --> 32:44.920
What, is this man kin that
you offer such kindly terms?

32:45.004 --> 32:47.714
Am I not accustomed to a
quarter on unsecured loans?

32:47.799 --> 32:51.093
MacGregor has 300 acres
at Craigrostan, my lord.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.517
A man of property
intent on growing richer.

32:59.227 --> 33:03.397
Well, we have more in common than
I would have suspected, MacGregor.

33:03.731 --> 33:09.736
£1,000 for three months, you say,
and these acres of yours as security?

33:10.655 --> 33:12.072
And my oath.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.825
Yes.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.871
Tell me, is there something
in what Killearn says,

33:19.956 --> 33:22.249
that you might have
driven off my cattle,

33:22.333 --> 33:26.753
and returned them with stories of
tinkers caught and summarily executed?

33:27.672 --> 33:30.507
I have, in my day, thieved
cattle, Your Lordship,

33:30.591 --> 33:32.926
but none that were
under my watch.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.096
Is that what passes for
honor with a MacGregor, then?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.433
What passes for honor
with me

33:39.517 --> 33:42.436
is likely enough the same
as with Your Lordship.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.022
When my word is given,
it is good.

33:46.733 --> 33:50.819
Well, you are to be congratulated
on such cheaply bought nobility.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.492
Killearn will draw papers.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.163
And I will expect
the terms to be met.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.959
My thanks
to Your Lordship.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.893
Aye, but it's a fine,
bold signature you have,

34:23.978 --> 34:26.897
worthy of
a chieftain himself.

34:26.981 --> 34:29.190
Are you Rob Roy MacGregor?

34:29.317 --> 34:32.444
I am. And what's your
name? Davey Anderson.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.946
Hello, Davey Anderson.
Hello.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.326
Even the servant boys
know who you are.

34:39.409 --> 34:43.121
You've become a famous reiver and
retriever in your own lifetime.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.415
Business and profit.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.250
And a soft winter.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.335
Are you
Rob Roy MacGregor?

34:52.965 --> 34:54.049
I am.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.676
I'm Will Guthrie.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.513
You heard of me?

35:00.306 --> 35:01.848
No, I have not.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.185
Well, I've heard of you.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.479
Indeed.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.357
And what have you heard, Mr. Guthrie?

35:10.817 --> 35:14.694
I heard you backstabbed
Tam Sibbald.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.910
Were you and Tam kin?

35:22.537 --> 35:23.954
Near enough.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.540
I shagged his sister.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.376
Likely so did Tam.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.088
You want the wind
let out of your bladder?

35:35.633 --> 35:38.260
What's your business
with me, Guthrie?

35:42.640 --> 35:43.640
Business

35:44.183 --> 35:46.101
best done outside.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.321
We have no quarrel.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.407
That can be remedied.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.546
The first cut?

36:14.630 --> 36:15.714
Aye.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.345
Well done.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.144
Some other time,

36:30.730 --> 36:32.606
when we're both sober.

36:46.579 --> 36:50.498
Tam Sibbald has a longer reach
dead than he ever did living.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.708
I'm away home.

36:51.792 --> 36:54.377
Keep the pony and stick to
Killearn till you have the note.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.214
I'll see you back in Craigrostan. Aye.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.015
I'm to wait here
till the note is signed.

37:07.099 --> 37:09.851
Aye. We are
the obedient one.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.646
Fetch and carry
at command.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.023
Tell me, McDonald, why has
a smart young lad like you

37:15.107 --> 37:17.525
attached himself to
such a bunch of tinkers?

37:17.610 --> 37:19.611
I would have thought you more
fit to serve a man like my master,

37:19.695 --> 37:20.737
the Marquis of Montrose.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.698
I do not serve Robert
MacGregor, Killearn.

37:24.659 --> 37:29.204
I'm his friend, and count
myself fortunate to claim it.

37:30.873 --> 37:34.000
My God, what a crew
you Highlanders are.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.336
With your airs and honors,

37:36.420 --> 37:40.215
come begging £1,000 as if you
were doing the lender a favor.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.009
Sheep shaggers,
the lot of you.

37:47.014 --> 37:51.935
My mother could come no nearer than
three candidates for my paternity.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.231
The Earl of Rutland.

37:56.315 --> 37:59.025
Now, there's a name
for a whore master.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.696
A secretary to
the Spanish Ambassador,

38:04.448 --> 38:07.325
whose name she hazarded as Ferdinando.

38:09.704 --> 38:14.291
And some young buck she never saw who
raised her skirts at a masked ball.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.959
He ravished her?

38:17.169 --> 38:19.921
I would put it no higher than surprised.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.927
Archie, take me with you.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.888
Wherever, whatever.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.850
Take me away with you.

38:32.310 --> 38:37.689
I am away, Betty, and God help
me, this is where I've landed.

38:38.607 --> 38:39.816
You think me a gentleman

38:39.900 --> 38:42.736
because I have linen
and can manage a lisp.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.865
I am but a bastard abroad,

38:48.534 --> 38:52.495
seeking my fortune
and the favors of great men,

38:54.165 --> 38:57.751
as big a whore as
my mother ever was.

39:00.087 --> 39:02.255
I'm pregnant by you,
Archie.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.428
Well.

39:12.933 --> 39:18.021
When it asks for its father's name,
at least you'll have it to give.

39:19.732 --> 39:22.275
Mr. Cunningham,
it's me, Killearn.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.653
A word with you.
Don't let him see me.

39:33.537 --> 39:36.915
You are a carbuncle on this
arse of a country, Killearn.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.250
And if you ever inform against
me to His Lordship again,

39:39.335 --> 39:42.629
I'll squeeze the pus out
of you with my bare hands.

39:46.133 --> 39:50.553
My, Archie, but you have
a rare contempt in you.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.973
I gave you no leave
to call me familiar.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.894
Could I pay
for the privilege?

39:57.978 --> 39:59.646
At a fair price.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.189
What are you
gibbering about?

40:01.273 --> 40:03.983
Money, Archie.
Money. What else?

40:05.903 --> 40:07.445
How much money?

40:09.990 --> 40:14.035
Let's talk inside
over a dram.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.121
It's chill on the stairs.

40:16.997 --> 40:21.584
Say what you have to say.
I am engaged within.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.837
You've Betty
on her back.

40:25.464 --> 40:26.673
How much money?

40:27.591 --> 40:29.008
£1,000.

40:29.343 --> 40:32.887
£1,000. What does
£1,000 look like?

40:32.972 --> 40:35.265
Will we have enough
ponies to carry it?

40:35.349 --> 40:36.683
Not coin.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.144
A note of credit drawn
on His Lordship.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.146
At what interest, Rob?
One fifth.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.940
And he gets £200 profit
for three months?

40:44.024 --> 40:46.276
Aye. That's
the price of cash,

40:46.360 --> 40:49.362
and we must plan the
matter to the last penny.

40:49.905 --> 40:53.450
When Alan returns, he'll take three
of you, and you'll go to Crieff.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.326
There you'll bargain
with the drovers,

40:55.411 --> 40:58.079
and have the herd assembled when
I come with a kit for the drive.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.747
How many, Rob?
How big a herd?

40:59.832 --> 41:01.458
300, maybe more.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.960
And whatever we can
acquire along the way.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.254
No harm if a dozen
or more stick.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.673
We'll drive them into
Carlisle like an army.

41:08.757 --> 41:11.009
So let's have
all hands to it.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.762
And we'll stay warm this
winter, within and without.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.641
And to celebrate, we'll hold a
gathering and drink to our success!

41:25.024 --> 41:28.151
Right, McKinness. That's
two shillings still owed.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.949
Next.
Colqhoun.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.410
Colqhoun, what have
you got? A rabbit?

41:37.495 --> 41:38.661
Aye, a rabbit.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.706
Well, you're still
a week behind, Colqhoun.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.632
Must I wait all day
for my note, Killearn?

41:51.634 --> 41:54.761
Patience, MacGregor's man.
Your turn is marked.

41:55.137 --> 41:57.388
Take you that goat
to the pen.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.100
Come, young Davey Wilson.
What have you got for me?

42:01.185 --> 42:02.852
A rabbit.
Another rabbit.

42:02.978 --> 42:06.397
Does nobody have any money?
No, sir. Only a rabbit.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.462
Dreaming of the New World,
were we?

42:34.343 --> 42:39.138
I hear tell in the New World
they have tribes of noble savages

42:39.223 --> 42:42.600
with paint on their faces
and skins on their backs.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.354
You'll be well at home
among them.

42:46.438 --> 42:49.148
Enough of this tripe.
Have you the note?

42:49.650 --> 42:52.986
His Lordship is to
Edinburgh for the assize,

42:53.070 --> 42:55.029
then to London direct.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.906
Great doings at the court.

42:56.991 --> 43:00.076
And he's away without signing the note.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.579
The best I can do
for you is coin.

43:05.791 --> 43:07.542
This was not agreed.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.920
Agreed or no, there's £1,000
here. Take it or leave it,

43:11.005 --> 43:14.090
it makes no difference to me,
nor to His Grace.

43:16.510 --> 43:19.345
Aye, it's a terrible shock,

43:19.430 --> 43:22.724
the sight of such a fortune
within reach, is it not?

43:23.559 --> 43:26.102
It's just as well you have
the trust of the MacGregor,

43:26.186 --> 43:29.188
or I'd be hard pressed
to sign it over to you.

44:35.756 --> 44:38.299
Angus.
It's a great gathering, Rob!

44:48.811 --> 44:50.770
That Alasdair Roy
is a fierce dancer.

44:50.854 --> 44:54.107
The last time I saw you in such a
lather, you were flat on your back.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.694
Do not affront me
afore these folk.

44:57.778 --> 45:01.489
Rob, do you know why Calvinists
are against shagging standing up?

45:01.573 --> 45:02.949
No, Coll. I do not.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.535
They fear it might
lead to dancing.

46:11.059 --> 46:15.313
Stay back, or by God,
I'll shoot you dead.

46:16.064 --> 46:17.106
For a moment there,

46:17.191 --> 46:20.651
I thought you might take the
road to Greenock with your £1,000.

46:23.989 --> 46:26.491
Killing is not so easy
as it seems.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.232
He sat out there all day,
pondering on this.

50:28.942 --> 50:30.651
You gave him coin.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.069
He insisted upon it.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.113
When I told him His Grace
had not signed the note,

50:34.197 --> 50:35.281
he said you must have it,

50:35.365 --> 50:37.533
or the beasts could not
be bought at the best price.

50:37.617 --> 50:39.785
I'm hard put to see you
hand over such a sum

50:39.870 --> 50:42.079
on the demand of one who
couldn't bear the debt.

50:42.164 --> 50:43.748
He was your man,

50:43.832 --> 50:47.835
present at your signing of the
terms, ordered by you to wait.

50:47.919 --> 50:50.337
For a note, not a bag of guineas!

50:53.800 --> 50:55.718
It was not all guineas.

50:56.303 --> 50:59.597
These farmers pay in
small coin, I assure you.

50:59.681 --> 51:01.974
He signed for this
bag of coin?

51:02.309 --> 51:03.517
Indeed.

51:04.978 --> 51:06.145
He did.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.321
Almost as bold
a hand as yourself.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.870
And best be no
skullduggery here, Killearn.

51:22.954 --> 51:25.414
Alan McDonald stands
under my protection.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.375
Well, that's a great comfort
to us all, I must say,

51:28.460 --> 51:30.503
what with
£1,000 at risk.

51:43.850 --> 51:46.519
Now, listen.
We must search for Alan.

51:46.603 --> 51:48.395
I fear he's come
to mischief hereabouts.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.190
I say we look for him
in Greenock, Rob.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.945
It comes quickly to your mind
that he has robbed us, Alasdair.

51:56.029 --> 51:58.864
He spoke of the Americas often enough.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.116
And what?

52:00.200 --> 52:04.411
He walked to Greenock from Buchlyvie,
and sent his pony home without him?

52:04.496 --> 52:07.790
£1,000 would be enough
to buy him 10 ponies.

52:07.874 --> 52:10.126
Alan McDonald
did not betray me.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.461
Now to it,
and find his trace.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.381
Come on! To it!

52:17.634 --> 52:20.678
Go to Greenock, then, since you
have that stink in your nose.

52:20.762 --> 52:22.263
But, Brother,

52:23.348 --> 52:26.767
bad enough that it might be
so without you wishing it.

52:50.250 --> 52:52.501
Well, what news?

52:53.920 --> 52:57.131
The ship sailed the
day before I got there,

52:57.215 --> 53:00.718
and McDonald's name was not
on the harbormaster's list.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.849
But he wouldn't have
likely used his own name

53:06.933 --> 53:09.810
and him run off
with 1,000...

53:14.024 --> 53:15.107
Aye.

53:44.846 --> 53:48.057
Your Lordship, the Duke
of Argyll this way comes.

53:51.311 --> 53:55.898
John, you look like a man
who means to play hard.

53:55.982 --> 53:59.360
Do not presume to speak
above your station, sir!

53:59.444 --> 54:01.654
I will have
my rank from you!

54:04.366 --> 54:05.741
Your Grace.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.076
I have word from court

54:07.160 --> 54:09.578
that you are putting
my name about as a Jacobite,

54:09.663 --> 54:14.333
as one who would rise for the Stuart
should he land here to claim the throne.

54:15.210 --> 54:19.880
Great men such as yourself draw
rumors as shite draws flies.

54:19.965 --> 54:23.300
You are the shite, Montrose,
and the flies upon it!

54:24.010 --> 54:28.264
For all the flowers in your great
gardens, I know you in my nose.

54:29.933 --> 54:31.892
Keep your stink off my name,

54:31.977 --> 54:36.105
or by God, I will clip you as
close as one of your gelded trees,

54:36.189 --> 54:39.525
and this carrion you keep
will not come between us!

54:44.531 --> 54:48.200
What pride to use a
fellow peer in public so!

54:48.910 --> 54:50.452
Damn his pride!

54:54.332 --> 54:55.708
Forgive me.

54:57.377 --> 54:59.586
Damn His Grace's pride.

55:16.271 --> 55:17.855
Why is it so beyond
your belief

55:17.939 --> 55:21.984
that he might have yielded to the sight
of all that money put into his hand?

55:22.068 --> 55:26.155
Unguarded, unasked, but there,
a lifetime's wages in a bag.

55:26.239 --> 55:29.074
Because I know him. I know
him more than half his life.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.201
But was he ever
handed £1,000 before?

55:31.286 --> 55:36.040
He was handed a hundred times more. He
was given trust, and he repaid in kind.

55:36.916 --> 55:38.917
Why do you not believe me?

55:39.461 --> 55:42.755
All right, Rob. He
did not steal from you.

55:43.590 --> 55:45.716
But he has gone,
and the money's gone,

55:45.800 --> 55:48.886
and Montrose will not care if you
believe one thing or the other.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.765
That's another matter. No.
That is the only matter now.

55:53.224 --> 55:54.850
For all our sakes, Robert,

55:54.934 --> 55:58.520
you must take off your high
hat and make what terms you can,

55:58.605 --> 56:02.358
else our home is lost, and
ourselves His Lordship's tenants.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.730
Here comes
the bold Highlander.

56:41.815 --> 56:45.359
No arse in his breeks, but
too proud to tug his forelock.

56:45.819 --> 56:49.196
No doubt the rogue seeks
to blame his servant,

56:49.280 --> 56:51.949
for I hear there is
no word of the man.

56:53.118 --> 56:56.453
I see you're back in favor
with your tailor, Archibald.

56:56.538 --> 56:58.455
He must be a happy man.

56:59.374 --> 57:01.667
So, MacGregor,
how is it with you?

57:01.751 --> 57:02.835
As it was, my lord.

57:02.919 --> 57:06.046
There is still no word of
McDonald or Your Lordship's money.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.756
What are we to do, then?

57:07.841 --> 57:11.051
If Your Lordship would contract
with me for another sum,

57:11.136 --> 57:13.554
I would turn over all profit
and so repay my debt.

57:13.638 --> 57:17.099
I have but lost £1,000.
You ask me to risk another?

57:17.183 --> 57:20.102
My lord, the money was
stolen from me and from you.

57:20.186 --> 57:22.938
I am no part of your
incompetence, MacGregor.

57:23.022 --> 57:25.732
You signed a paper.
And I will honor it.

57:25.817 --> 57:28.902
Ply me not with
your honor, man.

57:30.613 --> 57:33.031
Let us keep
these matters simple.

57:33.324 --> 57:35.492
You are indebted to me.
On that we are agreed?

57:35.577 --> 57:37.202
We are, my lord.

57:38.329 --> 57:40.456
Know you the Duke of Argyll?

57:41.583 --> 57:43.375
By his repute alone.

57:45.211 --> 57:48.589
My report is that
Argyll is a Jacobite,

57:48.673 --> 57:52.301
and would declare for James Stuart
should he seek to reclaim the throne.

57:52.385 --> 57:55.137
These are intelligences
unknown to me, my lord.

57:55.221 --> 57:57.222
They are known to you now.

57:57.307 --> 57:58.557
I'm uncertain of
Your Lordship's meaning.

57:59.225 --> 58:01.101
Damn it, man!

58:01.186 --> 58:04.396
You and your clan are
Jacobites, bred to the bone.

58:06.149 --> 58:08.150
Argyll is nothing to you.

58:09.277 --> 58:11.653
I want your word
against him.

58:11.738 --> 58:15.616
Give it, and we will come to
some reckoning on what you owe me.

58:18.828 --> 58:23.790
I can be of no assistance to Your Lordship
in this matter of the Duke of Argyll.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.125
You owe me.

58:25.210 --> 58:27.419
I owe you money.
Nothing more.

58:28.213 --> 58:32.633
What you have asked is as below me
as it should be beneath Your Lordship.

58:33.593 --> 58:35.886
You misspeak yourself,
MacGregor.

58:35.970 --> 58:38.222
It is the Marquis of Montrose
who has misspoke himself,

58:38.306 --> 58:40.557
to ask my perjury
against his enemies.

58:40.642 --> 58:43.852
Leave the blade be, sir!
This is not your quarrel.

58:43.937 --> 58:48.065
You do not hear me, MacGregor.
I did not ask if or whether.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.444
Your land is forfeit to me
against your debt.

58:52.529 --> 58:56.031
Until that is settled, I will
have you lodged in the tollbooth.

58:56.115 --> 59:00.077
Take him into custody, Archibald.
You have my commission on it!

59:04.958 --> 59:06.959
My father spent
two years in that jail

59:07.043 --> 59:09.419
for no cause but the will
of great men like you.

59:09.504 --> 59:10.879
And I will not
go there, sir.

59:10.964 --> 59:12.130
Call out the watch,
damn you!

59:12.215 --> 59:14.800
Call nothing,
or I'll cut his throat!

59:16.553 --> 59:19.888
You are damned,
MacGregor. Damned to hell.

59:19.973 --> 59:23.392
Come, Your Lordship.
Leave the devil some work.

59:23.476 --> 59:25.769
You've done enough
for one day.

59:26.479 --> 59:28.355
Well, call out the watch!

59:28.439 --> 59:29.439
Yes, sir.

59:29.524 --> 59:30.649
Call out the watch!

59:30.733 --> 59:33.068
Do you hear me?
Call out the watch!

59:33.152 --> 59:36.488
You have slept your last
peaceful night, MacGregor,

59:37.991 --> 59:39.491
you and yours.

59:44.664 --> 59:46.915
What is John Campbell,
Duke of Argyll, to us, Robert,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.543
that you must defend him
against Montrose?

59:49.627 --> 59:50.877
I did not defend him.

59:50.962 --> 59:53.839
I refused to bear
false witness against him.

59:55.216 --> 59:58.385
Gregor, send men to the
passes and set watches.

59:58.469 --> 59:59.428
And the lochside?

59:59.512 --> 01:00:03.390
They'll not likely come along
by the shore, but watch all ways.

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:06.768
Now, listen, lads. I have to
go to the hills for a time.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:10.022
You stay by your mother
and be her help, you hear?

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:16.570
Let Argyll know that you
are persecuted for his sake.

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:19.865
I'm persecuted for no
man's sake but my own, Mary.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:23.952
What?

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:26.747
Would you have me lie against
my conscience to suit Montrose?

01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:30.125
No! To suit me
and Duncan and Ranald,

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:35.255
to stay home with your wife and children
instead of taking to the hills like a fox.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:38.216
Out!

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:41.136
Out! Out! Out!

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.430
He'll be with you
soon enough!

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:56.151
Take the boys and go to
Morag's. She'll make a place.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.488
And let Montrose's
troopers foul my house?

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:02.824
No harm will come to you.
Montrose's quarrel is with me.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:07.537
And you revel in it.
The great man against all.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:14.920
And likely you'll slip down in
the night when the mood takes you.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:19.174
Or will you just find yourself
a sheep to comfort you?

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:23.261
Aye, well, if I do, it will be
one that doesn't bleat so bitter.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.683
No trouble between them
and you. Give no cause.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.059
This is between me
and Montrose,

01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:32.521
and likely when he's broke a
few horses, he'll quieten down.

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:35.732
Watch Alasdair. Put him
where he can do no harm.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:37.693
Keep up the watch
for McDonald.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.486
Rob, he's long gone.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.406
Aye, but is he over
the seas or under them?

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.741
And, Coll,

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:49.454
ask Morag to go down to Mary.
She's sore at me for this business.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:53.959
That Montrose is a stoat of a man.
Heaven protect us from his like.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.669
When the king comes
across the water again,

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:57.462
we'll see him hung.

01:02:21.779 --> 01:02:24.489
Your Lordship will not regret
leaving this matter in my hands.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.617
I have some knowledge of how
best to bring such rogues to heel.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:32.038
Broken but not dead,
Archibald. That is all I ask.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:33.999
"Broken but not dead. "

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:36.710
It has a ring to it.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.005
Your health.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:19.920
Goodbye!

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.801
Instead of spying them out,
we should lay for them,

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.094
and cut them down as they
come through the passes.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:30.972
Aye, a wee war with
Montrose would suit us fine.

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:32.891
Listen, Alasdair Roy.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.353
Keep your watch, give
warning, and stay your hand,

01:03:36.437 --> 01:03:38.396
or you'll answer to me.

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:47.322
Damn that McDonald
has brought this on us.

01:03:47.406 --> 01:03:50.992
I never trusted the man. Always
at Rob's arse like a collie dog.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.579
Morag had a dream
on him. Saw him drowned.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:59.626
Maybe his ship sank, and him
loaded down with the theft.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.073
Give me your musket.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:50.672
Boys, wake up! Wake up!
Quickly! Quickly!

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:51.840
Get out of bed!

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.511
Go, go!
Bring the Gregorach!

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.093
I've come for the outlaw
Robert MacGregor.

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:40.305
If you think he'd be lying
in his bed waiting for you,

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.932
you're more of a fool
than you look.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.525
Search the outsheds.
Burn them.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.152
Kill the stock.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:57.197
You best stand aside,
Mistress MacGregor.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:08:00.408
You don't ask a whore.
You make her.

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:26.350
No!

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.710
Do you want yours now,
Killearn?

01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:37.171
Now that I've loosened her
up for you.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:47.599
Think of yourself
as the scabbard

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:50.810
and me the sword,
Mistress MacGregor.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.020
And a fine fit
you were, too.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:58.985
I will think of you dead
until my husband makes you so.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:04.115
And then I will think
on you no more.

01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:07.410
Indeed.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:10.079
Such a man as he will need
to see blood on his blade

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.498
before honor is satisfied.

01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:20.465
Tell him Archibald Cunningham
is at his service.

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:46.824
What are you gawking at? Have
you never been to war before?

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:52.038
You're a warrior, Archie,
and no mistake.

01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:21.234
If she doesn't come out, Archie,
there will be a reckoning.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.529
Shagging her's one thing,
burning her's another.

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:29.951
She'll be out. She's a
hater, that one. There she is.

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:55.184
Back to the boat!

01:12:03.777 --> 01:12:07.363
They say it's not a sin if
you don't take pleasure in it.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:01.376
Come on!

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:04.504
Come on!
Come on!

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:08.758
I am Alasdair
Roy MacGregor!

01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:11.803
Come on! Come on!

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.807
Is that the best
you can do?

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.649
Do it again,
bastards!

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:27.819
Come on!

01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:33.658
Come on! Come on! Come...

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:54.846
Mary, are you hurt?
Did they wound you?

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:07.108
Mary.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.071
What have they done?

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.035
We will avenge you.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.747
Rob will kill every
last one of them.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:26.627
He will not know.
Rob will not know.

01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.963
Mary, Rob must know.

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:32.467
He will not!
He will not know!

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.218
He will not!

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:37.722
I will not tell him,
and you will not.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.432
Do you hear me,
Alasdair MacGregor?

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:42.143
But, Mary, no.
It is what they want!

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:46.397
It is what the Englishman
wants! It is his plan!

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:50.943
You swear it to me.
Swear it!

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.571
I cannot! I cannot! Swear it! Swear it!

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:54.739
You can!

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:59.327
If I can bear it to be done,
you can bear to be silent!

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.704
Now, you swear it!
Swear it.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.165
Swear it. Swear it.

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:07.710
Swear it! Swear it!
I swear. I swear. I swear.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:18.721
And I will hold you to it.

01:15:20.098 --> 01:15:21.516
Mark me.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.665
But of MacGregor himself,
still no word?

01:15:45.749 --> 01:15:47.500
We will have him
soon enough.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:50.211
I have set such an affront
to his Highland honor,

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:52.213
that he will come
to redeem it.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.715
Very well.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.470
See to it that I am not
mocked, and in the meanwhile,

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:03.849
make my claim against these acres
in Lomondside for the debt he owes.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:09.981
Still no word of this
man of MacGregor's?

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.525
He who took the coin?

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.570
No, my lord, not a word.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:16.862
Nor will there be.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:20.074
This was a ploy of MacGregor's, to
take the money and blame another.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:23.494
His man is well hid, and Your
Lordship's money well spent.

01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:25.538
I wager it.

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:32.461
You have a rare grasp of the
conspirator's mind, Archibald.

01:16:33.338 --> 01:16:35.006
You're to be
commended on it.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:51.606
He sees through it, Archie.
I know him and his gibes.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.066
And you think it would
count against us if he knew?

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.527
He has another 300 acres
to plant and prune.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:00.615
And all for the price of a
paltry 1,000 Scotch pounds.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:03.409
A fair price by any
reckoning. Archie, sir!

01:17:04.369 --> 01:17:05.953
I must speak with you.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.837
I am dismissed from service
on account of my state.

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.797
And what is your state,
pretty Betty?

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:19.133
You know well.
I'm with your child.

01:17:19.259 --> 01:17:22.219
And he, this one,
has made report of it.

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:25.931
Betty, my report did nothing your
belly wouldn't announce on its own.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:31.228
Archie, what am I to do?

01:17:31.938 --> 01:17:33.189
Root it out.

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:36.817
If Killearn here does not know an
old crone with a twig I miss my guess.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.611
It's gone
too far for that.

01:17:39.404 --> 01:17:42.406
Then it will not be the first
bastard born in Scotland.

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:44.784
Archie, I love you.

01:17:46.411 --> 01:17:47.828
Love is a dunghill,
Betty,

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.373
and I am but a cock that
climbs upon it to crow.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.417
No!

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.491
It's a sore thing they have
done to us, Mary and me.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:30.204
Far past any wrong I had expected,
even from such as Montrose.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:33.207
He must pay for it, Rob!

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.126
Else what are we?

01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:38.713
Pay he will till
his teeth squeal.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.216
Think on it, now.
Think on it.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:47.638
Even if we raised all the
MacGregors, we could not, must not,

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.473
fight Montrose
in open battle.

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:54.520
He has 10, 20 times our numbers and
the strength of the Crown to back him.

01:18:55.647 --> 01:18:57.565
There is honor here.

01:18:57.649 --> 01:19:00.568
You were wronged.
Mary is wronged.

01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:04.655
Honor will be satisfied.
You know me well enough.

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.491
But consider this.

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:11.203
One house burned,

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:13.247
cattle killed,

01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:15.708
but none are dead,
none injured.

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:23.716
Rob is right.

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.135
Rob is right!

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:30.139
It is not within our reach
to harm such as Montrose.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.602
Wheesht! Wheesht! Wheesht!

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:38.022
Wheesht! Wheesht!

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.649
I will harm him.
Never fear.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.443
Aye!
Aye!

01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:46.739
The tenderest part of
the Marquis is his purse.

01:19:48.366 --> 01:19:49.950
We'll hurt him there.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.370
Thieve his cattle.
Steal his rent.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.833
Rent and cattle,
until his coffers are bled.

01:19:58.168 --> 01:19:59.877
Aye!
Aye!

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:03.214
Wait! Wait!

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:08.677
Wheesht!
Wheesht! Morag.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.680
We have not heard
Mary on it,

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:14.725
and in truth, she was
the one most affronted.

01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:25.069
Rob is right. What cannot
be helped must be endured.

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:07.987
It will look more like
itself when the sun shines.

01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:10.030
Eh, lads? Yeah.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:17.454
When we have our bed in it
and us in our bed,

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.540
it will seem home enough.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:26.797
All right, play can wait.
We have work to do.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:29.633
Duncan.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.614
I should have been
with you, Mary.

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:54.658
It wasn't right that
I was in the hills.

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:56.911
Then you would
be dead now.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:59.914
No. They would have
taken me to the tollbooth.

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:04.251
No. I think you
would be dead.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.932
I could not hear
all of it,

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.935
but Killearn talked of money
that Archie might take.

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.354
This is Cunningham,
this Archie?

01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:27.358
He is wild,
but it's not him.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:31.320
It's that Killearn.
He has the devil in him.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:35.324
Tell me about this money.
Did you hear a sum spoken?

01:22:36.534 --> 01:22:39.745
Archie said it would be the
easiest £1,000 he'd ever earned.

01:22:40.538 --> 01:22:43.707
The only pity that it would be
in Scots and not English pounds.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.251
How did he mean
to earn this £1,000?

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.462
I know not.

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:51.590
Save that Killearn said
no trace must be left.

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:57.262
My husband will appreciate
that you came with this word.

01:22:58.848 --> 01:23:02.393
Will you take some supper and
rest, Betty? For you look ill-used.

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:05.771
I'm no worse used than I
deserve, Mistress MacGregor.

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:07.773
For I have a bastard's
bastard in me.

01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:10.567
And no home for him
when he comes out.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.780
Well, we better feed you, or he
won't have the strength to try it.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.035
Lass, lass, lass.

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.496
Bear up now.

01:23:23.623 --> 01:23:26.792
Your bairn will have you,
and you will have it.

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.378
But I will not
have Archie.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:32.881
Mistress MacGregor,
I love him,

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:35.968
even after all.

01:23:36.469 --> 01:23:39.638
Is that not a worse sin than any other?

01:23:44.602 --> 01:23:46.270
No, Betty.

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:51.483
Love is never a sin,
only the lack of it.

01:23:52.318 --> 01:23:54.862
I knew it. I knew
they plotted against us.

01:23:54.946 --> 01:23:57.531
Damn them that
they carried it through.

01:23:57.615 --> 01:23:59.199
I will have them
before the assize.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:02.161
Killearn and Cunningham. Aye, and
Montrose, too, if he were part of it.

01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:04.455
You think such men
as these will admit this,

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:08.250
because wee Betty Sturrock, with
her belly under her chin, says so?

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:09.668
What's her belly
to do with it?

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.587
She's carrying
the Englishman's child.

01:24:11.671 --> 01:24:13.630
They'll call her a
whore come for revenge.

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.633
Now, they can say what they
like. She'll speak the truth.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:20.554
Robert, to these men, the
truth is but a lie undiscovered.

01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:22.389
I will have justice!

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:24.433
Alan McDonald is dead,
woman.

01:24:24.517 --> 01:24:26.602
Then take your case
to the Duke of Argyll.

01:24:26.686 --> 01:24:29.063
It's known he bears
Montrose no favor.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:31.565
You hold great store
by wolves of different shades.

01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:32.775
They're all alike at lambing.

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:35.778
And you will have nothing
but your own way!

01:24:36.988 --> 01:24:39.156
I tell you, Killearn and
Cunningham will not be condemned

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.033
before any assize
on Betty's word.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:45.287
Aye. But I know one
that will condemn them.

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:49.500
And I'll have them before it,
or I'm not Robert MacGregor.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:01.595
The Englishman will
never find him.

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:03.347
MacGregor knows
every rock and track,

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:06.058
and can walk faster
than the troopers can ride.

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:08.602
Look, put me
onto His Lordship

01:25:08.686 --> 01:25:11.271
as a man that knows
the highways and byways.

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.403
I'll find him.
I swear it.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:38.715
On your feet, Killearn.
You and I have business.

01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:44.012
Now is your moment, Guthrie. It
would stand well with His Lordship.

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:46.223
This is not your fight,
Guthrie.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.021
And if I make it
my fight?

01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:56.733
Then give Tam Sibbald my
regards when you see him.

01:25:56.901 --> 01:26:00.154
Fight him well and you'll
win His Lordship's favor.

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.697
I warrant it.

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.950
Please, please, please don't kill
me. Don't kill me. It wasn't me.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.285
Outside.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:54.333
It's him the lass
wants revenge on. Cunningham.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:58.295
And I grant it,
he treated her sore.

01:27:01.966 --> 01:27:04.718
If you harm me, His
Lordship will hunt you down,

01:27:04.802 --> 01:27:05.969
and you know it.

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:10.807
I'm past caring, Killearn.

01:27:23.154 --> 01:27:25.197
The lantern.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:37.501
Go back, get Betty, and we'll
try him before morning. Now.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.348
Inside.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.039
Mary! Mary!

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.666
Who is it?
It's Alasdair.

01:28:19.877 --> 01:28:23.547
Rob's holding Killearn, and he
wants to see Betty straightaway.

01:28:24.215 --> 01:28:25.590
I'll wake her.

01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:30.137
Treat her gentle. She's
near the end of her tether.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:36.226
Where's my father?

01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:39.730
Wheesht.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.445
Are the soldiers coming?

01:28:46.529 --> 01:28:48.447
You two should be sleeping.

01:28:48.906 --> 01:28:50.449
No!

01:28:50.533 --> 01:28:51.700
Stay there!

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.920
Get my knife!

01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:57.974
Mary? Where's the girl?

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.436
Betty Sturrock hanged
herself in our shed.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:05.816
She made me bring her. I
told... I made him bring me

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.568
for I have dealings
with this Killearn.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.154
Me and Betty Sturrock
and Betty Sturrock's child,

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.698
the three of us will
bring it out of him.

01:30:14.158 --> 01:30:16.159
No. This is no
matter for him.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.620
This is between us.

01:30:20.039 --> 01:30:23.625
As I am your wife, Robert, I
will have my way in this, I will.

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:40.725
Betty! Is that you?

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:42.811
Betty is dead.

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:47.899
She killed herself this
night, and her unborn with her.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:51.319
Mistress MacGregor.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.657
So the poor girl is dead.

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:59.119
Spare me your hypocrisy,
Killearn.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:03.415
You are as much her murderer
as she, you and that Englishman.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:05.876
I had no part
in her child

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:09.379
any more than that
matter at Craigrostan.

01:31:10.756 --> 01:31:15.177
You stood and gloated.
You did all with your eyes.

01:31:17.054 --> 01:31:19.055
You have not told him.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.934
You think me such a puppet that
I would put my husband's head

01:31:23.019 --> 01:31:25.729
in a noose fashioned
from my own dishonor?

01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:30.192
You have a proposal
for me. I can tell.

01:31:30.776 --> 01:31:35.280
You will sign your name to a statement
telling how you slew Alan McDonald,

01:31:35.364 --> 01:31:38.492
stole my husband's money,
burned our property.

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:40.535
Before a judge
you will sign it.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.747
And let them hang me in the
tollbooth for my trouble?

01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:47.000
No great inducement,
Mistress MacGregor.

01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:50.045
When it is signed,
you may go where you will.

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.172
Where you can.

01:31:54.717 --> 01:31:58.053
I shall not soon
forget, Mary,

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:01.056
the last time I saw you.

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:06.436
How nobly you walked from
that burning, like a queen.

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:11.525
You will sign it or else.
Or else what?

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.195
You'll tell Rob how Cunningham used you?

01:32:16.155 --> 01:32:20.033
I have another picture,
not so noble,

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:25.956
of you stood in Lomond water,
washing between your legs.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:31.044
I've wondered many a time
since that morning,

01:32:31.128 --> 01:32:34.339
did you wash Archie out of
you, or is he still in there,

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.299
growing into his father?

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:45.976
Yes.

01:32:47.853 --> 01:32:51.064
Well, I have a proposal
for you, Mistress MacGregor.

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:54.734
Persuade your man that
Cunningham alone killed his man

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:58.363
and kept the money entirely,
and I will not speak

01:32:58.447 --> 01:33:02.450
of what you have
inside you.

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:10.792
Rob would be hard pressed to
love such a bastard, would he not?

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:14.838
But you know
the saying, Mary.

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:17.632
'Tis a wise father
knows his own child.

01:33:17.883 --> 01:33:21.136
And if you'll not say
anything, neither will I.

01:33:27.643 --> 01:33:30.186
You have my word on it.

01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:44.618
Cut me...

01:33:48.664 --> 01:33:51.708
She cut me.
The bitch cut me!

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:57.547
Mary, are you hurt?
Are you hurt?

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.098
What have you done, woman?

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:18.443
Am I cut bad?
Am I cut bad?

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:24.324
Not bad enough for me.

01:34:34.126 --> 01:34:36.419
I mean, my God, what
made you do such a thing?

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:40.090
I have as much cause
as you in this. More.

01:34:40.257 --> 01:34:41.675
He has to be
made to confess.

01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:43.134
He will never confess.

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:45.512
Betty was right.
He has the devil in him.

01:34:45.596 --> 01:34:48.807
Devil or no, he's my
prisoner. Don't you understand?

01:34:52.311 --> 01:34:56.356
Robert, there are things
you must know.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.818
Things I have to tell you.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:02.946
So? Tell me.

01:35:05.616 --> 01:35:06.783
There was...

01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:10.995
Well?

01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:14.791
He's dead, Rob.
I could do nothing.

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:21.214
Robert, listen to me now.

01:35:21.298 --> 01:35:23.383
There's no time
for talk now.

01:35:23.467 --> 01:35:25.802
Alasdair,
can you sink a man?

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.721
Aye.
Cut the wind out of him,

01:35:27.805 --> 01:35:30.056
put a rock in his belly,
take him out where it's deep.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:32.517
Montrose will scour us
out now for sure.

01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:35.812
We must make sure you and the
lads are safe before he comes.

01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:38.565
Deep, mind you!

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:44.320
I am mocked by this rogue who
you took to deliver me broken.

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:48.742
'Tis myself who will be
broken if these raids go on.

01:35:49.952 --> 01:35:53.830
Now my factor is abducted in plain view.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.541
Am I gone mad?

01:35:56.834 --> 01:35:58.877
Your Lordship...
Do not...

01:35:58.961 --> 01:36:01.880
Do not, I say,
speak in my stead.

01:36:06.635 --> 01:36:10.054
There's something here
that I do not see.

01:36:12.808 --> 01:36:14.934
Killearn and you have
some hand in matters

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:16.853
that is hid from sight.

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:26.112
This tells me that you are in cash,
yet I know you are without means.

01:36:27.156 --> 01:36:30.116
Gaming, Your Lordship.
The cards favored.

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:35.872
Do you take me
entirely for a Whig, sir?

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:49.969
I care not what you and that
greasy capon have cooked up,

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:52.639
but put an end to this
impudence against me.

01:36:52.723 --> 01:36:55.767
I am James Graham,
Marquis of Montrose.

01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:58.061
And I will not be mocked.

01:36:59.396 --> 01:37:01.439
You hear me?

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:07.904
On the roof!
On the roof with it!

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.783
Take it from the back!

01:37:24.129 --> 01:37:26.714
We can't let them burn,
loot, and ride away.

01:37:29.426 --> 01:37:32.595
We should hit them, Rob.
Cunningham is there.

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.431
He's the one that took...
I know who he is.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.017
Have you no thought
to avenge Mary for that?

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:40.937
There's 30 or more men.
They'd ride us down like sheep.

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:43.231
Alasdair MacGregor
is no sheep.

01:37:43.315 --> 01:37:46.234
Coll's right.
We can do nothing.

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:06.504
Company, make ready!

01:38:11.802 --> 01:38:13.845
Attention, men!

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:22.770
Damn the wee fool! Scatter! Into
the mist. Find your own way home!

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:33.948
There they are!

01:38:34.658 --> 01:38:36.159
After him!

01:38:36.493 --> 01:38:37.911
I want MacGregor!

01:38:38.495 --> 01:38:40.496
Fire, you fools! Fire!

01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:45.585
I hit one of them.

01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:47.420
And it will cost us,
I'm thinking.

01:38:49.506 --> 01:38:51.591
Move! Move!

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:57.764
God's curse on you
for a brother, Alasdair.

01:38:57.973 --> 01:38:59.599
I want MacGregor!

01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:05.271
You're getting too old
for the wars, Rob, eh?

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:27.543
Come on!

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:34.509
Fire! Fire,
you fools! Fire!

01:39:34.593 --> 01:39:36.761
Put me down. I can run. Shut your mouth.

01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:41.683
Run, Rob, run!

01:39:41.892 --> 01:39:44.811
Go on, Rob!
Run for yourself!

01:40:11.755 --> 01:40:15.883
I want MacGregor!
I want MacGregor! After him!

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:23.099
Be quiet!

01:40:46.123 --> 01:40:47.790
Hold still.
Hold still.

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:54.422
Knocked the breath
out of me.

01:40:55.174 --> 01:40:58.509
Rob, I can't feel my legs.

01:40:59.678 --> 01:41:00.970
Are they there?

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:04.724
Aye, aye.
Your legs are fine.

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:10.980
Forgive me, Rob, for
I can't forgive myself.

01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:13.024
Save your breath, lad.

01:41:15.819 --> 01:41:17.987
I couldn't have
saved her, Rob.

01:41:20.157 --> 01:41:22.533
They were done with Mary
before I reached them.

01:41:22.618 --> 01:41:24.869
She made me swear
not to tell you.

01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:26.871
I'm sorry.

01:41:26.955 --> 01:41:29.791
Done what with Mary?
Done what?

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:31.626
She said...

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:35.505
She said if
she could bear it...

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.177
What of Mary, Alasdair?
Rob, I can't see.

01:41:41.345 --> 01:41:44.972
I'm here, Alasdair.
What of Mary? What of it?

01:41:46.391 --> 01:41:48.017
They...

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:51.437
They violated her.

01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:06.035
Alasdair, who did this?

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:09.372
The mist is clearing.
Be ready.

01:42:15.003 --> 01:42:16.462
Be ready
to search upwards!

01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:18.256
You men,
search upwards!

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:48.119
There was a shot
on the ledge.

01:42:59.089 --> 01:43:00.756
Forward!

01:43:05.929 --> 01:43:07.889
Where is he?
Over there!

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:12.560
Get the horse!

01:43:38.754 --> 01:43:43.007
Well, well. The great
MacGregor come to hand at last.

01:44:34.351 --> 01:44:37.228
Well, how does it seem
to you tonight, MacGregor?

01:44:41.191 --> 01:44:43.985
Is God's great plan for
us all to your liking?

01:44:46.738 --> 01:44:49.907
"Broken but not dead"
was His Lordship's request.

01:44:49.992 --> 01:44:52.201
Well, I will do my part
if you will do yours

01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:55.162
and not die before
the bridge at Glen Orchy.

01:44:56.873 --> 01:44:58.541
Tell me,

01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:02.712
what did you do with that
bag of guts, Killearn?

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:10.886
Vex me not, MacGregor. Or I
shall have you dragged awhile.

01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:13.055
I'm a man of my word.

01:45:15.517 --> 01:45:18.311
You're a thief,
a murderer,

01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:22.231
and a violator of women.

01:45:24.776 --> 01:45:27.695
I had hoped you'd come to me
long since on that score.

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:32.450
If I had known earlier, you
would have been dead sooner.

01:45:36.246 --> 01:45:39.832
I will tell you something
to take with you.

01:45:41.626 --> 01:45:46.088
Your wife was far
sweeter forced

01:45:46.798 --> 01:45:48.716
than many are willing.

01:45:50.093 --> 01:45:53.596
In truth, put to it, I think
not all of her objected.

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:33.135
I appreciate the honor you do me,
Mistress MacGregor, in bringing your case.

01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:36.097
But from all I'm acquainted
with your husband,

01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:38.516
he has earned the enmity
of the Marquis of Montrose

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.935
by borrowing money
that he cannot repay,

01:46:41.019 --> 01:46:43.396
and ever harrying
his stock as blackmail.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.523
There is more to the matter, Your Grace.

01:46:45.607 --> 01:46:49.402
I'm sure there is, but it is not
part of mine to intrude myself.

01:46:49.986 --> 01:46:52.613
Sensible as I am
to your condition.

01:46:54.324 --> 01:46:57.076
It's a hard thought,
but men make the quarrels

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.495
and women and weans bear them.

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:04.333
Your Grace, Robert finds himself in
this condition for taking your part.

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.002
My part?

01:47:08.171 --> 01:47:10.840
What cause had he to do
that and in what manner?

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.261
He refused to condemn
you by false witness

01:47:15.345 --> 01:47:18.973
when the Marquis asked him
to say you were a Jacobite,

01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:21.976
to injure your name
at court.

01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:24.103
Montrose asked this of him?

01:47:24.187 --> 01:47:25.980
In remission of this debt.

01:47:27.482 --> 01:47:29.233
But Robert refused.

01:47:30.986 --> 01:47:33.737
I did not know your husband
bore me such good will.

01:47:34.823 --> 01:47:38.284
Indeed, Your Grace, I think he
favors you no more than any great man.

01:47:40.036 --> 01:47:42.955
"As wolves at lambing"
is his word for you all.

01:47:45.208 --> 01:47:47.626
It was not done
for Your Grace

01:47:48.587 --> 01:47:50.588
but for his own honor,

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:53.466
which he holds dearer
than myself or his sons,

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:57.219
his clan or kin. And for
which I have oft chided him.

01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:01.724
But it is him
and his way,

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:05.936
and were he other, he would
not be Robert Roy MacGregor.

01:48:08.231 --> 01:48:09.899
He would not come
here before you

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:12.276
nor would he favor me
to do so in his stead.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:18.073
But I have no choice, unless I
give him up entire to his enemies.

01:48:20.577 --> 01:48:22.203
And though
I love his honor,

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:26.582
it is but a moon-cast shadow
to the love I bear him.

01:48:29.044 --> 01:48:32.379
For the grace of God,
I have his child inside me.

01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:36.050
And I would have
a father for it.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.597
You do your man
no dishonor, Mary.

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:46.519
Faith, he is a man
much blessed by fortune.

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:14.880
They have MacGregor,
my lord.

01:49:34.150 --> 01:49:35.985
Cavalry, halt!

01:49:36.319 --> 01:49:39.113
Broken but not dead, Your
Lordship, as you requested.

01:49:40.699 --> 01:49:41.699
Ungag him.

01:49:47.163 --> 01:49:48.831
So, MacGregor,

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.543
what have you
to say for yourself?

01:49:52.961 --> 01:49:56.755
I have been wronged
by Your Lordship

01:49:57.674 --> 01:49:59.800
and by those
who serve him.

01:50:00.051 --> 01:50:01.677
You are wronged?

01:50:02.345 --> 01:50:03.387
You?

01:50:04.139 --> 01:50:07.600
If I am not much mistaken, it
is myself that is short £1,000,

01:50:07.684 --> 01:50:11.645
whose cattle is reived, and whose
factor, Killearn, is abducted.

01:50:12.314 --> 01:50:15.357
Then ask this thing here
where your money is

01:50:16.026 --> 01:50:19.194
and where he sunk Alan
McDonald after he killed him.

01:50:21.531 --> 01:50:24.366
Same accusations he spat
at me, Your Lordship.

01:50:24.743 --> 01:50:26.744
Desperate words
from a desperate man.

01:50:28.246 --> 01:50:30.789
Do you have proofs
of these matters?

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:34.752
You have my word on it.

01:50:36.671 --> 01:50:39.381
I think it will take
more than that.

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.093
Then you have the nature
of this man here.

01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:47.640
If Your Lordship cannot tell
what is true from what is not,

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:51.810
then I fear his judgment
is beyond repair.

01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:01.612
Hang him from the bridge.

01:51:18.296 --> 01:51:20.506
MacGregor!
Cut him free!

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:35.396
Bring him back here!

01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:37.815
I want him back!

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:42.986
Bring him
back here!

01:51:46.991 --> 01:51:48.409
In the water!

01:52:36.666 --> 01:52:37.958
I see him!
I see him!

01:53:12.494 --> 01:53:14.369
Right through that gap!

01:53:15.079 --> 01:53:16.955
Just through there!

01:53:26.883 --> 01:53:28.300
Get off your mounts and walk.

01:53:28.384 --> 01:53:30.219
What a stench!
Get after him!

01:53:32.388 --> 01:53:35.015
What a stink!
Wait till you smell this.

01:53:45.568 --> 01:53:47.694
Let's get downwind
of this.

01:53:54.118 --> 01:53:55.953
Is this
where we may stay?

01:53:56.037 --> 01:53:59.498
Aye, by His Grace's goodness,
under his protection.

01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:02.668
Will Father come here? If he can.

01:54:17.892 --> 01:54:18.892
Coll!

01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:28.944
No!

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.928
Robert?

01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:58.599
Robert!

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:00.893
My Robert!

01:55:10.278 --> 01:55:12.487
What have they
done with you?

01:55:16.701 --> 01:55:18.952
You should have
told me, Mary.

01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:28.086
Robert, I should have,
but I could not.

01:55:29.714 --> 01:55:32.090
Forgive me, my love.
I was wrong.

01:55:32.842 --> 01:55:34.092
It was wrong.

01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:37.512
No. It was me
who was wrong.

01:55:38.848 --> 01:55:41.391
You were right when you told
me I must have it my own way.

01:55:41.476 --> 01:55:43.602
It's that which brought
all this on us.

01:55:43.853 --> 01:55:47.064
I should have packed my pride
and given Montrose his way.

01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:49.983
No, Robert. And all this has come on us,

01:55:50.068 --> 01:55:51.652
all this you have endured. No.

01:55:51.819 --> 01:55:55.781
Craigrostan would still be ours.
Alasdair and Coll would be alive.

01:55:56.199 --> 01:55:57.366
And wrong would
have been done you!

01:55:58.409 --> 01:56:01.495
And what of the wrong done
you, wrong past bearing?

01:56:01.579 --> 01:56:05.374
No, not past bearing.
Not past bearing.

01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:10.003
Not if I have my Robert
and he has himself.

01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:14.216
And you would not, not if you
had done a lesser man's bidding.

01:56:18.137 --> 01:56:21.473
Honor is the gift a man gives
himself. You told our boys that.

01:56:24.352 --> 01:56:27.896
Would you have stolen from yourself
that what makes you Robert MacGregor?

01:56:35.905 --> 01:56:37.280
My Mary.

01:56:42.203 --> 01:56:44.079
How fine you are to me.

01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:49.251
And you to me.

01:57:15.945 --> 01:57:17.946
Robert, there is more.

01:57:20.116 --> 01:57:21.450
What more?

01:57:27.123 --> 01:57:29.082
I am carrying a child

01:57:31.002 --> 01:57:33.628
and I do not know
who is the father.

01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:41.344
Ach, Mary.

01:57:42.346 --> 01:57:43.472
Mary.

01:57:44.057 --> 01:57:46.266
I could not kill it,
husband.

01:57:58.321 --> 01:58:00.947
It is not the child
who needs killing.

01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:05.994
This point of honor
might likely kill you, sir.

01:58:06.079 --> 01:58:09.581
I have seen the man at work
and he is no dunce with a blade.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.502
If Your Grace could arrange this
I would be more beholding to him

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:15.253
than I already am.

01:58:20.676 --> 01:58:23.345
Very well. I will see
what I can make of it.

01:58:26.557 --> 01:58:27.891
MacGregor.

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:29.684
Sir?

01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:32.187
He will kill you, MacGregor.

01:58:33.022 --> 01:58:35.690
I would lose money
if I wagered other.

01:58:38.694 --> 01:58:41.571
Your Lordship has my permission
to profit what way he may.

01:58:59.841 --> 01:59:03.093
I have had a correspondence from
His Grace, the Duke of Argyll.

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:07.222
It would seem that our
MacGregor is holed with him.

01:59:08.015 --> 01:59:11.434
He offers us a match.
You and the Highlander.

01:59:12.895 --> 01:59:16.064
Argyll would recoup his
loss from his last wager.

01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:21.027
Bring him on.

01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:24.823
You speak, Archibald?

01:59:26.576 --> 01:59:30.078
One must never underestimate
the healing power of hatred.

01:59:40.047 --> 01:59:42.215
How long must
you go, Father?

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.341
Just for a while.

01:59:43.426 --> 01:59:45.594
Is it business
you have with the Duke?

01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:47.679
Aye, business.

01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:57.439
So, boys, have you heard there's going
to be another addition to the family?

02:00:00.985 --> 02:00:02.861
Show them where
it's hid, Mary.

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:06.531
Is it inside you?

02:00:08.326 --> 02:00:10.118
How does it get out?

02:00:13.789 --> 02:00:15.749
The same road it got in.

02:00:30.014 --> 02:00:31.306
Robert...

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:34.226
Robert, what if you don't... Wheesht.

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:35.810
No, I cannot.

02:00:42.193 --> 02:00:43.526
What if...

02:00:45.321 --> 02:00:46.571
I cannot.

02:00:48.032 --> 02:00:50.367
What if you do
not return to us?

02:00:53.704 --> 02:00:55.997
If it's a boy,
call him Robert.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.501
If a lass,

02:01:00.670 --> 02:01:03.588
name her for my love,
Mary MacGregor.

02:01:28.114 --> 02:01:30.448
My man Guthrie was like
an ox at the knacker's yard

02:01:30.533 --> 02:01:31.950
under Cunningham's blade.

02:01:32.493 --> 02:01:34.869
You will need to be twice
as quick as poor Will.

02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:37.789
Tell me, MacGregor,

02:01:37.873 --> 02:01:40.667
is this matter of honor
concerning your wife?

02:01:40.751 --> 02:01:42.752
It's concerning me,
Your Grace.

02:01:42.837 --> 02:01:45.338
Mr. Cunningham and I
have matters outstanding.

02:01:45.423 --> 02:01:48.591
She will not thank you for
making her a widow, honor or no.

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:51.511
Perhaps you'd like to wager
a sum for her maintenance.

02:01:52.138 --> 02:01:56.057
If it will help you die any
easier, I'll lay 20 guineas for her.

02:01:56.225 --> 02:01:58.018
50 would go further.

02:01:58.144 --> 02:02:01.646
By God, but you have a
style to you, MacGregor.

02:02:01.772 --> 02:02:04.399
I like that. Aye.

02:02:39.435 --> 02:02:43.521
So, what are we to wager
on this outcome, Your Grace?

02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:45.648
Guineas again?

02:03:09.131 --> 02:03:12.592
I want no part of this. There
are more than champions here.

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:15.553
I think these men
hate the other.

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.263
Aye.

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.975
They are none too fond.

02:03:21.811 --> 02:03:23.561
You offered MacGregor
amnesty from his debts

02:03:23.646 --> 02:03:25.522
if he would lay
charges against me.

02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:29.567
So, that is how he cozened
you to give him shelter.

02:03:30.528 --> 02:03:32.946
I know the truth
when I hear it.

02:03:34.824 --> 02:03:38.827
And here was me thinking that
that was God's gift alone.

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:42.580
Do not think that all sins go
unpunished in this life, Montrose.

02:03:43.332 --> 02:03:44.541
Well...

02:03:47.128 --> 02:03:49.671
I see one set soon
to be paid for.

02:03:56.637 --> 02:03:58.763
Will you not take
my odds, Argyll?

02:03:59.181 --> 02:04:01.266
I give you five
on the fop.

02:04:03.227 --> 02:04:05.019
I wager you but this,

02:04:05.855 --> 02:04:09.357
if MacGregor lives, you will
acquit him of all he owes you.

02:04:13.195 --> 02:04:14.779
And if he loses?

02:04:16.198 --> 02:04:17.991
I will pay his bill.

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:23.705
My factor will call upon
Your Grace's factor.

02:04:48.564 --> 02:04:50.565
You are here on
a matter of honor.

02:04:50.649 --> 02:04:53.234
I am here to assure you
settle it honorably.

02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:55.862
There will be
no backstabbing.

02:04:55.946 --> 02:04:57.864
You will not
throw your blades,

02:04:57.948 --> 02:05:00.909
nor will you use weapons
other than agreed.

02:05:00.993 --> 02:05:02.869
If quarter is asked...

02:05:02.953 --> 02:05:04.704
No quarter will be asked.

02:05:04.914 --> 02:05:06.164
Or given.

02:05:07.416 --> 02:05:11.377
Attend upon your weapons,
and commence upon my mark.

02:09:48.822 --> 02:09:50.782
Neither asked nor given.

02:10:55.055 --> 02:10:57.348
I will hold you
to our bargain.

02:11:44.313 --> 02:11:46.230
Those wounds will need care.

02:11:46.315 --> 02:11:49.317
By Your Grace's leave, I'll
go where it can best be found.

02:11:50.152 --> 02:11:51.485
As you will.

02:11:52.362 --> 02:11:54.614
I will know who to
wager on the next time.

02:11:57.743 --> 02:12:00.286
I hope Your Grace
will live so long.

02:13:10.399 --> 02:13:11.983
Mother! Look!
