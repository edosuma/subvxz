01:21.880 --> 01:24.269
Mom, we're starving.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.676
Why tell me?

01:27.280 --> 01:30.158
Do I look like Sally Struthers?

01:31.080 --> 01:32.559
Besides, with the Super Bowl...

01:32.760 --> 01:35.035
...your father has taken away
our food allowance...

01:35.240 --> 01:38.676
...so he can buy his own snacks
for the game.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.758
You think he'd mind
if we just took a little?

01:57.960 --> 02:00.679
Are you feeling lucky, punks?

02:01.560 --> 02:03.312
Buck is cute though.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.633
Let's get together as a family, kill him,
and retake the fridge.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.508
Mom, are we really doomed
again to watch Dad...

02:10.720 --> 02:13.518
...sit in his Polk High uniform
with a football in one hand...

02:13.720 --> 02:15.631
...and himself in the other?

02:16.960 --> 02:18.313
Kids, please.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.996
You think I like seeing him happy
one day a year?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.278
Well, what can I do?

02:24.480 --> 02:27.040
I am banned from the house
during the Super Bowl...

02:27.240 --> 02:29.674
...and I can't even call
during the Bud Bowl.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.913
Have you thought about taking
the time to learn the game...

02:34.120 --> 02:35.519
...so you could watch together?

02:35.760 --> 02:38.479
You mean so we could enjoy something
as a couple?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.195
No. So you could ruin any enjoyment
he could possibly have...

02:42.400 --> 02:43.719
...during the game.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.071
So he would leave the house and
we could get our hands on his Cheetos.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.032
And we could watch
whatever we want.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.236
- Well, how about the Super Bowl?
- Sure.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.550
Oh, that's a great idea.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.910
Bud, teach me about football.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.391
Okay, well, first we can
go over some calls.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.234
Okay, this is holding.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.875
This is a reception.

03:05.080 --> 03:10.393
And this is two weeks
after dating Kelly.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.633
Here's one you might recognize,
Mom:

03:24.840 --> 03:27.400
Bud on a Saturday night.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.999
- Why, you...
- Come on. Come and get it.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.794
Kids! Kids, kids, kids.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.837
Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.711
Kids, your daddy's home.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.558
Hi, Dad.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.432
- AI, guess what.
- Not now, Peg.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.234
I have a big announcement.
I need your complete attention.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.398
Today I got the latest issue
of Shoe News.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.238
You know their motto:

04:04.440 --> 04:07.398
"Before it's on your foot,
it's in your head."

04:07.840 --> 04:09.558
And I have it on good authority...

04:09.760 --> 04:13.992
...that they're coming out with a new,
all-sport athletic shoe.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.709
Oh, Al.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.116
Kids, let us join hands...

04:20.320 --> 04:24.233
...and remember where we were
on this mighty day.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.112
Tell us more, Al.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.153
Will they come in pairs, honey?

04:30.360 --> 04:33.557
There's more, my little aneurysm.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.230
It's going to be called the Zeus.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.989
And they're kicking off their new ad
campaign with a special commercial...

04:40.200 --> 04:42.953
...that will be shown
during the Super Bowl.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.436
And here's the part
that means something to us:

04:46.640 --> 04:49.313
They're going to use ex-jocks
in this commercial.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.036
You don't get it, do you?

04:55.920 --> 04:59.708
Well, you should know that better
than anyone, sweetheart.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.596
Don't you see? Ex-jocks.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.519
Who's the most famous ex-athlete
in Chicago?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.391
- Ernie Banks.
- I said, athlete.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.953
You know that means football.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.397
- Gayle Sayers?
- Can you be this thick?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.033
Let me give you a hint.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.033
The FTD florist?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.994
No, you nitwit, me.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.599
Polk High, all-city.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.598
Most touchdowns in a single game.
If you don't listen to me...

05:33.800 --> 05:36.439
...you've heard others talk about it
in malls...

05:36.640 --> 05:39.632
...anywhere Americans gather
to talk sports.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.912
I'm a shoo-in for that commercial.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.439
Get it, shoo-in?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.950
Well, Shoe News will appreciate it.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.833
Anyway, I'm just gonna go audition
for that commercial...

05:55.040 --> 05:57.713
...and in a few short weeks
you'll see your old Dad on TV...

05:57.920 --> 05:59.478
...during the Super Bowl.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.238
Now what have you got to say?

06:01.480 --> 06:05.837
Honey, did you pick up those
little blue disks for the toilet tank?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.398
Yes.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.548
- I'm putting it in.
- No me.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.512
- I'm putting it in!
- Me!

06:15.560 --> 06:20.475
Is not my news at least as exciting
as a blue disk for a toilet?

06:20.680 --> 06:23.069
Well, honey,
I'm sure I'd be just as excited...

06:23.280 --> 06:27.637
...if I was married to the blue disk
and it brought you home for the toilet.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.549
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking...

06:31.760 --> 06:34.354
...I'm not gonna get this commercial.
- Not at all.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.269
I'm thinking you are a fool to even
think you're getting this commercial.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.869
Honey, you played
high school football.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.435
That doesn't mean anything
to anyone anymore...

06:43.640 --> 06:46.677
...including me. And I'm your wife.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.111
I took a vow to care and I don't.

06:52.120 --> 06:57.148
You're just jealous because the ad said
"ex-jocks," not "ex-brunettes."

06:59.680 --> 07:02.319
You're not getting it, Al.
They want someone famous.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.431
I'm famous!

07:05.440 --> 07:06.668
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.468
Who is the man who scored
four touchdowns in a single game...

07:17.680 --> 07:20.752
...to clinch the city championship
in 1966?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.151
- Shaft. John Shaft.
- No.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.837
Who is the man who rushed
for 200 yards against Garfield High?

07:28.080 --> 07:31.356
- Shaft. He's a bad...
- Shut your mouth.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.395
Just talking about Shaft.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.157
You people obviously
don't know anything about football.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.679
What do you care about?

07:40.720 --> 07:45.510
Peggy, have you seen these
fantastic blue disks for the toilet?

07:46.320 --> 07:48.993
Why, this is the best thing
that could have happened to Al.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.437
Next to the invention of a bowl
6 feet wide with tall rims...

07:52.640 --> 07:55.029
...for the problem aimer.

07:56.760 --> 08:01.834
But now, unlike your career,
you have something to shoot for.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.151
You people can't be serious.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.994
I want you to admit
having played high school football...

08:08.200 --> 08:10.714
...is probably the most important thing
a guy could do.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.511
Yes, if a person died
right after high school.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.914
But don't worry, Al...

08:17.120 --> 08:19.998
...it's probably not too late
for you to do something important.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.591
Why some day, you may even stop
a bullet meant for the president.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.360
Oh, I'm sorry, Marcie.
I must be boring you.

08:31.560 --> 08:36.155
Anyone who obviously spends as much
time in barber shops as you do...

08:36.960 --> 08:41.078
...must have heard every sports story
a guy could hear.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.388
You better cut that out, Al.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.189
I think Marcie looks as cute as a button
with her hair cut this way.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.311
Thank you, honey.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.552
Al, just to close up this subject:

09:04.760 --> 09:07.957
It's not that we are belittling
your place in sports history.

09:08.160 --> 09:12.870
It's just that you are like a toilet
without a blue disk.

09:13.600 --> 09:18.879
Fine for its time,
but now barely worth flushing.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.749
Now give me a kiss
and make me some coffee.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.479
I will not.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.798
I'm going to audition for
this commercial, and get it, by God.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.389
Then we'll see,
when I go down for this interview...

09:30.600 --> 09:34.752
...who in Chicago
doesn't know the name Bundy.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.349
- Who?
- Bundy.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.518
B-U-N-D-Y. Al Bundy.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.479
Made all-city back in '66.
Four touchdowns.

09:44.680 --> 09:48.559
And I'm not talking the whole year.
One game.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.832
Well, have a seat,
and allow me time to cool off.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.834
Miss Lagroin,
who's on our list for today?

10:07.360 --> 10:12.229
Well, there's Mr. Butkus, Mr. Carlton,
Mr. Tarkenton, Mr. Namath...

10:12.440 --> 10:14.954
...and of course, Mr. Bindy.

10:15.160 --> 10:19.278
He scored four touchdowns,
not in one year, but in one game.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.596
- Guess where?
- High school.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.990
Thought I'd die when I met him.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.435
Well, send him in
before the real athletes come.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.234
Okay, Mom, now who's the guy
who hikes the ball to the quarterback?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.351
- The centre.
- Very good.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.199
Now who's the guy
who rushes the passer?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.709
- The defensive end.
- Excellent.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.838
Now who's the little foreign guy
who can barely speak English...

10:51.040 --> 10:55.955
...never gets hit and is taking yet
another job away from an American?

10:56.840 --> 11:00.799
- The place-kicker.
- Great job, Mom.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.120
Now next, next we'll start on stats.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.954
Oh, can I teach her
the stats, please?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.753
- Sure.
- Okay.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.837
Now, we have Alaska...

11:14.040 --> 11:19.160
...Alabama, Brazil...

11:21.200 --> 11:24.351
Oh, and the two Georgias,
North and South.

11:30.160 --> 11:33.357
And yet, men still seem to like her.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.073
Oh, there's your daddy's car.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.555
Now, he's gonna come in here
and tell us he failed.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.513
So let's practice
what we're gonna say to him.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.039
The classics never die.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.111
Laugh at this, hyenas: I got it.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.834
I got the commercial.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.628
I am the Zeus man.

12:22.720 --> 12:26.315
So I think it's important to understand,
before we get started...

12:26.520 --> 12:28.317
...that, yes,
the shoes are important...

12:28.520 --> 12:32.308
...but let's not disappoint the public in
what they've come to expect from me.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.432
So let's try not to get too arty
and lose sight of the man.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.676
Oh, by the way,
be careful how you shoot me...

12:37.880 --> 12:42.829
...because from certain angles it would
appear I'm losing a hair or two...

12:43.040 --> 12:44.632
...you know what I mean?

12:44.880 --> 12:48.270
Sure. Why tell me? I'm the caterer.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.835
Put some food in my car
and go away.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.634
Hi, I'm Jerry Copeland the director.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.269
Try not to speak directly to me.

12:59.480 --> 13:05.237
Now, you will be
portraying the common man.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.517
Well, that will be
a bit of a stretch for me, Jerr.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.631
I played high school football,
you know?

13:10.880 --> 13:12.552
- You're speaking to me.
- Sorry.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.833
Well, anyhow, I'm sure you would want
to meet your co-star in the first scene?

13:17.080 --> 13:19.878
Not really,
but I guess he'd like to meet me.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.994
Bindy, meet Ed "Too Tall" Jones.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.755
Too Tall?
You gotta be kidding me.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.952
Are you in the scene with me?
Peg! Peg! Look who's...

13:42.200 --> 13:45.590
Need someone to run your lines
with you, baby?

13:46.120 --> 13:50.193
Will someone please wheel
the elderly woman away.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.071
Okay.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.999
We're ready.
Well, you know what to do.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.317
No I don't, Jerr.
No, see, I never got a script.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.511
Well, just follow your instincts,
Bindy.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.708
That must be what they tell Brando.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.236
Not that I'm comparing myself
with Brando.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.000
He's fat.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.755
Oh, by the way, Too Tall,
my name is Al "Too Great" Bindy.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.032
You... I'm sure you heard of me.
Made all-city back in '66.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.273
And you're the guy that was
raiding the refrigerator in my trailer.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.074
Twice.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.792
What I'm trying to say is, don't feel bad
about having to pull back.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.228
Just don't hurt yourself.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.710
Thanks a lot
for making me feel welcome.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.393
Ready.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.636
- And, deck him!
- "Deck" who?

14:50.280 --> 14:52.999
Yes, Mom, personal foul.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.913
Whoa, Too Tall, babe. Great rehearsal.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.395
Now, let's just shoot the next one.
Do you mind?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.319
Not at all.
I think you could see me pull back.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.553
Okay, dust off the shoes
and get the old guy back on his feet.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.711
- Maybe we should do something.
- Yeah.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.068
Hey, Too Tall,
can I get your autograph?

15:15.280 --> 15:18.078
Hey, how did you get
the name "Too Tall"?

15:19.480 --> 15:22.278
Does it really refer to your height?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.155
No.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.474
Okay, for this one,
all you have to do is bat.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.433
Well, that's no problem.
I play a little softball.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.039
Only three-time MVP...

15:38.240 --> 15:39.912
...the 20-store-and-under mall league
ever had.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.838
One time we were playing
Binky's Pets...

15:42.040 --> 15:46.431
Great. Now, say hi to your co-star,
Steve Carlton.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.429
Put her right here, baby.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.839
It's awful nice to meet you,
Mr. Carlton.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.594
You probably haven't thrown
a baseball in a long time...

16:06.800 --> 16:08.950
...whereas I'm an active player,
so, you know...

16:09.160 --> 16:12.835
...don't worry about looking bad
because the camera will be on me.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.514
I'm sure your heart is as big
as the ball you use.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.479
Okay. Places, everyone.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.069
Okay, Steve. Now, it's no big deal.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.590
- Just bean him.
- No problem.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.679
"Bean" who?

16:33.240 --> 16:36.437
Yes, Mom, "intentional grounding."

16:42.640 --> 16:44.915
Hey, there's an eyebrow on it.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.351
Daddy, look, I got the ball.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.794
No, Daddy,
they're still looking for your ear...

16:55.000 --> 16:58.117
...but I'm gonna have him sign it
right underneath your eyebrow.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.675
How would you like it to read?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.428
Okay, great.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.355
Mr. Carlton, could you please sign this
to "the late Al Bundy"?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.117
Oh, yeah.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.756
Okay, time to take his bandage off.

17:26.720 --> 17:30.429
Al, honey, I've been thinking about this
and I think we better go home.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.039
I'm worried you might get hurt.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.952
Don't worry about me, Peg. I'm fine.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.469
Hey, will somebody answer
that phone?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.914
I'll get it myself. Hello?

17:41.440 --> 17:43.032
Another damn wrong number.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.912
Besides, Peg, this should be fun.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.396
It's always been an amateur's dream
to see how far he can go with a pro.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.989
I used to do a little boxing.
And what I wanna do...

17:51.200 --> 17:53.555
...is get in one good shot
and get a bit of respect.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.875
What I'm gonna do, Peg...

17:55.080 --> 17:58.834
...I'm not gonna wait for the director
to say "action." I'm gonna cheat.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.314
And when the guy gets in the ring,
I'm gonna pop him with one.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.919
A good right hand, right away.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.635
And I don't care, pro or no pro,
that's gotta hurt, Peg.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.673
- Hey, you're...
- Action!

18:26.960 --> 18:32.796
Wow, he didn't even have time
to spit out a whimpering "no mas."

18:33.600 --> 18:36.478
Sugar Ray, very nice.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.312
That was fun.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.476
You know,
it's every professional's dream...

18:40.680 --> 18:43.319
...to see how bad he can hurt
a non-pro.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.911
Help me.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.430
Well, it looks like he's been hurt.
We better make sure he's okay.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.590
Hey, did you hurt your hand
on my dad's jaw?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.518
Hey, I'm curious about your name.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.109
How did you get the name Leonard?

19:07.560 --> 19:10.916
Sugar Ray, I blinked
and I missed the whole thing.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.078
- Could you hit him again?
- Sure, yeah.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.632
Al, get up.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.717
What thinking man would call
a down-and-out pattern...

19:30.920 --> 19:34.117
...7 yards downfield
when you need 8 for a first down?

19:34.320 --> 19:36.038
Idiots.

19:36.280 --> 19:40.159
- What's happening, Peg?
- Shut up, Al, I'm watching the game.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.633
So, what were those athletes
really like?

19:43.840 --> 19:46.070
Oh, well,
they couldn't have been nicer.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.829
At the party after the shoot we talked
and we danced and...

19:50.040 --> 19:51.268
It would have been great...

19:51.480 --> 19:54.233
...except that Al kept calling
from the hospital.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.276
Why I let him put me down as who
to notify in case of emergency...

19:58.480 --> 19:59.993
...I'll never know.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.515
It's like they know
when you're having a good time.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.395
It's half-time. All right, Al's commercial
should be on any second.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.791
At last, America will finally see me
in all my athletic glory.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.348
Zeus.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.915
The all-sport shoe
for the week end warrior.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.315
You may not play lik e a pro.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.672
You may not hit lik e a pro.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.878
You may not fight lik e a pro.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.479
But with Zeus, you won't have to.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.471
Zeus, the shoes that will outlive you.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.748
Hey, what happened to my face?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.992
You inherited it from your father.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.272
They can't do that to me.
I'm the Zeus man, damn it!

21:09.480 --> 21:11.471
Oh, well,
I guess it really doesn't matter.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.796
As long as my family saw me.
They were there.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.560
They saw me with those pros,
and I took their best shots.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.115
Who wants to be the first to
put a pen in my mouth...

21:19.320 --> 21:20.912
...and get an autograph?

21:21.760 --> 21:25.435
Good news, folks,
our toilet disks finally come in green.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.599
It's lik e having a pine tree
in your toilet.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.674
Well, at least I'll get to watch the game
in peace.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.508
And now uninterrupted
by commercials...

21:48.720 --> 21:52.759
...we proudly present. ;
Steel Magnolias.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.036
Oh, no, not Steel Magnolias.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.710
Buck. Buck, change the Super Bowl
back on. I can't move.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.831
You accidentally
changed the channel.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.148
Accident, my ass.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.158
I love this movie.

22:09.360 --> 22:14.559
Julia Roberts, so ill, so brave.
