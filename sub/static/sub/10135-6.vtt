- Good luck today.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.301
- Tanner, I never shake hands.

10:34.342 --> 10:38.263
Oh, of course, you invented

10:34.342 --> 10:38.263
the Ranger Roy bear hug.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.308
- Lay one on me.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.308
- Get away from me.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.892
What's the matter?

10:42.934 --> 10:45.812
Well, now that I'm retiring

10:42.934 --> 10:45.812
I can tell you the truth.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.482
I suffer from acute

10:45.853 --> 10:48.482
physical paranoia.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.732
Anyone touches me

10:49.774 --> 10:52.735
I hyperventilate

10:49.774 --> 10:52.735
and break out in hives.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.156
That's why I started that

10:52.777 --> 10:56.156
whole "hug yourself" thing.

Howdy-ho, Ranger Roy.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.326
Oh, this is the comedy genius

10:59.367 --> 11:01.411
I was telling you about,

10:59.367 --> 11:01.411
Joey Gladstone.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.205
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.205
- Good luck, Joey.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.665
You can't touch him.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.251
Well, nobody can touch him,

11:05.706 --> 11:08.251
he's a living legend.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.337
But if anybody's gonna

11:08.293 --> 11:10.337
fill his hiking shoes

11:10.378 --> 11:11.963
it might as well be me.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.798
Ranger Roy, here.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.510
Check this out, sir.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.386
Mr. Woodchuck,

11:16.551 --> 11:18.386
Merle the Squirrel

11:18.428 --> 11:20.472
lives here in

11:18.428 --> 11:20.472
the enchanted tree house.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.848
How would you like living there?

11:21.889 --> 11:26.019
Well, I have been looking

11:21.889 --> 11:26.019
to branch out.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.524
Cute. What else have you got?

11:30.565 --> 11:34.361
Well, basically, sir, I do every

11:30.565 --> 11:34.361
cartoon voice known to man.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.571
Well, blow me down. Whoa!

11:36.613 --> 11:38.448
A-gah-gah-gah-gah!

11:39.199 --> 11:40.783
Eh, what's up, doc?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.620
Oh, I hate that rabbit.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.039
Jetson, get in here.

11:46.747 --> 11:50.168
I'm sorry, George.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.921
Gladstone, you're the man

11:50.210 --> 11:53.921
I've been looking for.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.715
- Really? I got the job?

11:53.963 --> 11:56.715
- Hmm.

11:56.757 --> 12:01.095
Oh, thank you, Ranger Roy sir.

11:56.757 --> 12:01.095
Your Highness, Your Woodsiness.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.056
I love you.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.558
Joey.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.518
Stop hugging him, Joey.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.019
You don't know

12:06.560 --> 12:08.019
what this means to me.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.147
I'm just as choked up

12:08.061 --> 12:11.147
about this as you are.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.815
Just let, let go of the man.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.442
Thank you so much for the job.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.860
I gotta call my agent.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.531
This is the luckiest day

12:15.902 --> 12:19.531
of my life!

12:23.326 --> 12:25.245
Forgive Joey. He didn't

12:23.326 --> 12:25.245
know what he was doing.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.582
You made a real

12:25.286 --> 12:28.582
smart move by hiring him.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.124
He's fired.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.550
- Come on, go, go!

12:36.590 --> 12:38.550
- Go, go, go!

12:38.592 --> 12:39.967
- Pull it, go, go!

12:38.592 --> 12:39.967
- Go, go!

12:40.009 --> 12:42.554
- Yes!

12:42.596 --> 12:43.971
Boy, how did we ever live

12:44.013 --> 12:47.016
without the Truck

12:44.013 --> 12:47.016
and Tractor-Pull Channel?

12:51.688 --> 12:54.190
Somebody took my tap shoes.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.364
Does that finger in my face

12:58.403 --> 13:01.364
mean you think it's me?

13:02.323 --> 13:03.617
Duh.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.541
Steph, what do you

13:08.496 --> 13:11.541
know about this?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.501
Well, I know I'm just

13:11.583 --> 13:13.501
as sad about this

13:13.543 --> 13:16.963
tap shoe tragedy as she is.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.006
Oh, puh-lease.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.219
Howdy-ho, junior rangers.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.472
Guess who is the new Ranger Roy!

13:25.513 --> 13:28.057
- 'Alright!'

13:25.513 --> 13:28.057
- Joey, you got the job.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.184
You guys,

13:28.099 --> 13:30.184
talk about a lucky day.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.271
First a newspaper strike

13:30.226 --> 13:33.271
saved me from a bad review.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.398
Then, I won tickets

13:33.313 --> 13:35.398
to Donny and Marie.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.900
Then a beautiful woman

13:35.440 --> 13:37.900
came over and fixed our cable

13:37.942 --> 13:39.736
and she's going out

13:37.942 --> 13:39.736
with me tonight.

13:39.778 --> 13:43.448
I'd pinch myself, but I'd

13:39.778 --> 13:43.448
probably just strike oil.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.328
You guys are gonna love this.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.747
I found out why

13:48.369 --> 13:50.747
Uncle Jesse is so obsessed

13:50.789 --> 13:53.207
with finding cool names

13:50.789 --> 13:53.207
for the twins.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.668
I called grandma

13:54.709 --> 13:58.963
and she said that Uncle Jesse's

13:54.709 --> 13:58.963
real name is Hermes.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.924
Hermes?

14:03.134 --> 14:05.178
I'm married a Hermes?

14:05.219 --> 14:09.432
- I got an Uncle Hermes?

14:05.219 --> 14:09.432
- Yup.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.476
He was teased

14:09.474 --> 14:11.476
so much in kindergarten

14:11.518 --> 14:14.020
that he begged grandma

14:11.518 --> 14:14.020
to change it to Jesse.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.191
Hey, those are my tap shoes.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.567
Drop 'em.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.904
You guys see what Comet dug up?

14:23.946 --> 14:27.033
Well, you know how dogs

14:23.946 --> 14:27.033
like to bury things.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.868
In a plastic bag?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.373
Stephanie Tanner, you should

14:30.411 --> 14:33.373
be<i> ashamed</i> of yourself.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.960
Alright, I did it.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.253
And I'm glad.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.505
All day long it's been

14:40.547 --> 14:42.173
tea for two, tap, tap, tap.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.884
Tea for two, tap, tap.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.554
I couldn't take it anymore!

14:47.595 --> 14:51.558
It was either get rid of those

14:47.595 --> 14:51.558
tap shoes or lose my mind.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.729
Tea for two. Tap, tap, tap.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.606
Tea for two. Tap, tap.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.275
Thank you for finding my shoes,

14:58.648 --> 15:01.275
Uncle Hermes.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.861
You're welcome.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.493
What did you call me?

15:10.535 --> 15:12.537
Uncle Hermes.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.537
That's your name.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.336
Who told you my name was Hermes?

15:20.378 --> 15:22.296
- Grandma.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.296
- She's lying.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.673
Jess.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.134
Okay.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.429
It's...Hermes.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.936
Hermes is not only

15:34.267 --> 15:36.936
the Greek God of swiftness..

15:36.977 --> 15:39.230
...but it's also

15:36.977 --> 15:39.230
my great-grandfather's name.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.982
I'll have you know he saved

15:39.272 --> 15:41.982
the whole town from destruction

15:42.024 --> 15:45.695
when he raced a river of lava

15:42.024 --> 15:45.695
down a mountain barefoot.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.987
Alright, he went

15:45.737 --> 15:46.987
to tell the whole town

15:47.029 --> 15:48.573
that the volcano had erupted.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.157
Of course,

15:48.615 --> 15:50.157
no one was left in the town

15:50.199 --> 15:52.410
because who could miss

15:50.199 --> 15:52.410
a volcano erupting, but..

15:52.452 --> 15:53.703
'...the point

15:52.452 --> 15:53.703
I'm trying to make here'

15:53.745 --> 15:55.037
is the name Hermes is equated

15:55.079 --> 15:58.625
with strength, courage

15:55.079 --> 15:58.625
and very hot feet.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.086
So now, who among you

16:00.000 --> 16:02.086
will make fun of a name

16:02.128 --> 16:05.840
so bold and so courageous

16:02.128 --> 16:05.840
as Hermes, huh?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.592
I'm sorry, honey.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.386
We didn't realize the name

16:07.634 --> 16:10.386
meant so much to you.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.347
So do you want me

16:10.428 --> 16:13.347
to call you Uncle Hermes?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.516
No, what am I,

16:13.389 --> 16:15.516
some kind of geek?

16:15.558 --> 16:16.935
Come here.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.938
Joey, I gotta talk

16:18.478 --> 16:19.938
to you about something.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.398
I know,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.398
the newspaper strike's over

16:22.440 --> 16:23.650
and I got a bad review.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.944
But who cares?

16:23.691 --> 16:25.944
I'm gonna be Ranger Joe.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.612
They can't touch me.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.988
Joey, listen..

16:29.029 --> 16:31.491
[phone rings]

16:29.029 --> 16:31.491
Oh, hold on, one second.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.370
Hello? Uh-huh.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.749
Well, I'll be down right away

16:36.412 --> 16:39.749
to pick up the tickets.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.000
Oh, no.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.338
My fourth cousin's

16:42.669 --> 16:45.338

16:45.379 --> 16:46.923
All family members

16:45.379 --> 16:46.923
are disqualified

16:46.965 --> 16:50.593
from winning

16:46.965 --> 16:50.593

16:50.635 --> 16:56.182
Uh-huh, well, sure, I'll take

16:50.635 --> 16:56.182
a KFLX sweatband. Mm-hmm.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.350
Bye.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.020
Phew! Boy, of all

16:58.476 --> 17:01.020
the rotten luck.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.313
Yeah, speaking of rotten luck..

17:02.355 --> 17:06.025
[knock on door]

17:02.355 --> 17:06.025
Just a second.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.486
- Oh, hi, Linda.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.486
- Joey, bad news.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.988
Oh, no, they're taking away

17:10.029 --> 17:12.239
my Truck and Tractor-Pull

17:10.029 --> 17:12.239
Network, aren't they?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.909
Worse. The whole cable's out.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.244
But we're still on

17:14.951 --> 17:17.244
for that concert, right?

17:17.286 --> 17:21.415
Well, it turns out I don't

17:17.286 --> 17:21.415
have those tickets after all.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.334
That is so typical.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.836
You were just using me.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.421
No, I wasn't. I swear.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.675
You want a KFLX sweatband?

17:30.717 --> 17:33.803
Sure, where is it?

17:33.845 --> 17:36.472
I don't have it right now.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.183
Oh, there's a shock.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.230
Boy, if this wasn't

17:42.812 --> 17:44.230
my lucky day

17:44.271 --> 17:47.149
I'd be a little blue right now.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.569
Joey, sit down, carefully.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.198
Look, um..

17:54.240 --> 17:56.409
...I think Ranger Roy

17:54.240 --> 17:56.409
is having second thoughts

17:56.450 --> 17:58.036
about giving you the job.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.704
Why? What did he say?

17:59.746 --> 18:03.041
- He said you were fired.

17:59.746 --> 18:03.041
- What are you talking about?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.918
He loved me so much

18:03.082 --> 18:04.918
he was speechless.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.086
That's because

18:04.959 --> 18:07.086
he couldn't breathe.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.464
He has a condition known

18:07.127 --> 18:10.464
as acute physical paranoia.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.841
Oh, no.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.301
I was on him like

18:11.883 --> 18:14.301
a piranha on a pork chop.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.263
Oh, my God.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.766
I have to stop that thank-you

18:17.304 --> 18:19.766
telegram I sent him.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.100
How could a telegram hurt?

18:21.141 --> 18:24.812
- Danny, it's a Hug-O-Gram.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.812
- A what?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.480
A guy dressed in a bear suit

18:26.522 --> 18:29.316
who hands you balloons and

18:26.522 --> 18:29.316
gives you a great big bear hug.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.737
I even paid extra

18:29.358 --> 18:32.737
for the tummy rub.

18:32.779 --> 18:37.283
I'm no expert, but I'd say

18:32.779 --> 18:37.283
your lucky streak is over.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.620
Maybe not. Maybe I can still

18:37.324 --> 18:40.620
get a second shot at that job.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.831
I gotta stop that bear.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.045
We're on in one minute.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.421
Ranger Roy?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.423
For me?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.509
And a Hug-O-Gram

18:52.465 --> 18:55.509
from Joey Gladstone.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.388
No, stop that bear!

18:59.430 --> 19:01.015
Get off him, it's a mistake.

19:01.057 --> 19:05.103
Get off him. The man can't

19:01.057 --> 19:05.103
stand to be touched.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.479
- Hey, buddy!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.479
- Sorry about this.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.856
I still owe you

19:06.520 --> 19:08.856
for the tummy rub.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.191
(male #1)

19:08.898 --> 19:11.191
'Yeah, you do.'

19:11.233 --> 19:13.277
Ranger Roy.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.155
I guess you

19:13.319 --> 19:16.155
got your bear hug, huh?

19:17.949 --> 19:21.535
Kids, why don't you

19:17.949 --> 19:21.535
go find a stump?

19:21.577 --> 19:22.870
We're on in 15 seconds.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.498
- Tanner, cover for him.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.498
- Me?

19:25.539 --> 19:28.250
Here, here. Take Merle!

19:29.543 --> 19:31.211
I don't know

19:29.543 --> 19:31.211
anything about puppets.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.089
Except if you machine-wash 'em

19:31.253 --> 19:33.089
their eyes come off.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.966
That's good enough. You're on.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.487
a little breather.

It doesn't matter, because I'm

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
here. I'm Ranger Dan.

19:58.572 --> 20:02.451
If you're a ranger,

19:58.572 --> 20:02.451
where's your uniform?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.787
Oh, well, that's

20:02.493 --> 20:04.787
a very good question

and, uh, here's the answer.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.416
Uh, he's an undercover ranger.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.044
Hey, thank you, Earl.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.670
It's Merle.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.296
He's funny.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.548
Okay, you know what?

20:15.589 --> 20:18.342
It's time to meet

20:15.589 --> 20:18.342
my deputy ranger.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.762
Come on over here,

20:18.384 --> 20:21.762
and, everybody, let's say

20:21.804 --> 20:24.015
Howdy-ho, Ranger Joe.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.893
No, thank you, Ranger Dan.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.145
What Ranger Joe

20:26.934 --> 20:29.145
doesn't realize is

20:29.187 --> 20:31.605
this could be his

20:29.187 --> 20:31.605
big chance to be somebody.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.108
Forget it.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.108
My luck's run out.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.111
Ah, there's a good lesson to be

20:34.150 --> 20:37.111
learned here, boys and girls.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.780
You make your own luck

20:37.153 --> 20:39.780
in this crazy, mixed-up world.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.490
Sit down, buddy.

20:41.532 --> 20:44.618
Kids, let's all give a big

20:41.532 --> 20:44.618
howdy-ho to Ranger Joe.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.246
(all)

20:44.660 --> 20:47.246
Howdy-ho, Ranger Joe!

20:48.372 --> 20:49.999
Go get 'em, buddy.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.129
Howdy-ho, junior rangers.

20:55.171 --> 20:58.049
Junior rangers,

20:55.171 --> 20:58.049
what do you say we say hello

20:58.091 --> 20:59.592
to the hippest

20:58.091 --> 20:59.592
coolest critter

20:59.633 --> 21:02.386
in the forest, Mr. Woodchuck.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.846
(all)

21:02.428 --> 21:03.846
'Yay!'

21:05.890 --> 21:09.309
Thank you, Ranger Joe.

21:05.890 --> 21:09.309
Thank you, kids.

21:09.351 --> 21:13.397
So, uh, how do you like living

21:09.351 --> 21:13.397
here in the Enchanted Forest?

21:13.439 --> 21:15.566
Well, it looks delicious.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.986
I've never seen so much..

21:19.028 --> 21:20.320
...wood.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.326
It kind of reminds me

21:23.199 --> 21:26.326
of where I'm from.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.661
Oakland.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.418
Hey, kids, how would you like

21:30.623 --> 21:34.418
to hear a Mr. Woodchuck joke?

21:34.460 --> 21:35.753
(all)

21:34.460 --> 21:35.753
Yay!

21:36.921 --> 21:39.423
- Knock, knock.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.423
- Who's there?

21:39.465 --> 21:42.301
- Isadoor.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.301
- Isadoor who?

21:42.342 --> 21:45.179
Is a door made of..

21:45.221 --> 21:46.722
...wood?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.269
Howdy-ho, junior rangers.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.148
(all)

21:51.310 --> 21:55.148
Howdy-ho, Ranger Roy!

21:55.189 --> 21:57.399
Well, junior rangers,

21:55.189 --> 21:57.399
it looks like Ranger Roy's

21:57.441 --> 21:58.776
back in the Enchanted Forest.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.069
So I'll just take a hike

22:00.111 --> 22:02.155
to the

22:00.111 --> 22:02.155
Enchanted Unemployment Office.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.906
Not so fast.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.324
I have an announcement.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.121
This show is the last one

22:07.160 --> 22:10.121
for Merle and me.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.413
(all)

22:10.163 --> 22:11.413
Oh.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.999
But the good news is

22:13.040 --> 22:15.126
Ranger Joe is taking over.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.837
(all)

22:15.168 --> 22:17.837
Yay!

22:17.878 --> 22:20.673
Aw, shucks, golly!

22:17.878 --> 22:20.673
You really mean it, Ranger Roy?

22:20.714 --> 22:22.008
The smiles on these faces

22:22.049 --> 22:24.760
show me that I've made

22:22.049 --> 22:24.760
the right choice.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.263
So, here's your

22:24.802 --> 22:27.263
official ranger hat.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.935
Wow! It fits and everything.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.021
This is the luckiest day

22:32.977 --> 22:35.021
of my life.

22:35.062 --> 22:38.607
Okay, kids,

22:35.062 --> 22:38.607
now let's give Ranger Joe..

22:38.649 --> 22:42.528
...a great big bear hug.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.701
Okay, kids, cut it out.
