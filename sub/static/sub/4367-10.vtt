00:01.665 --> 00:03.883
You are being watched.

00:03.885 --> 00:06.686
The government has a secret system...

00:06.688 --> 00:10.706
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.708 --> 00:13.292
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.294 --> 00:15.043
but it sees everything...

00:15.045 --> 00:18.264
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.266 --> 00:20.933
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:20.935 --> 00:23.552
We don't.

00:23.554 --> 00:28.190
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.192 --> 00:30.392
You will never find us.

00:30.394 --> 00:32.226
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.229 --> 00:35.603
if your number's up, we'll find you.

00:38.407 --> 00:40.236
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.

00:40.238 --> 00:44.373
If you're watching this,
you'll know I'm in trouble.

00:44.375 --> 00:50.212
I've always tried to
be good, keep the rules.

00:50.214 --> 00:53.432
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.

Bear, <i>afliggen!</i>
Sit.

01:16.273 --> 01:18.273
Well, that was a big help.

01:18.275 --> 01:19.675
So, you said we had another number?

01:19.676 --> 01:22.277
Yes.
Abby Monroe, 26.

01:22.279 --> 01:24.713
Honor student at school,
degree in engineering.

01:24.715 --> 01:27.115
She's worked for the last year
at a military charity,

01:27.117 --> 01:29.451
Homes For Our Returning Heroes,

01:29.453 --> 01:31.420
maybe because her younger brother

01:31.422 --> 01:35.891
was killed in Afghanistan
18 months ago.

01:35.893 --> 01:38.894
She quit the charity a week ago.

01:38.896 --> 01:42.348
She's now working as a temp
in a city planning office.

01:42.350 --> 01:43.766
Any threats?

01:43.768 --> 01:46.268
Not that I can see, but some anomalies.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.154
She dumped her phone five days ago

01:48.156 --> 01:49.805
and moved out of her apartment.

01:49.807 --> 01:51.367
In fact, the only way I could trace her

01:51.368 --> 01:53.492
was through the temp agency.

01:53.494 --> 01:55.694
She's hiding from someone.

01:55.696 --> 01:57.479
I'd better get eyes on her.

01:57.481 --> 01:59.698
It's your turn to dry him.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.951
She could be in imminent danger, Finch.

02:01.953 --> 02:03.536
Mr. Reese,
he's your dog.

02:03.538 --> 02:06.922
You'll manage.

02:14.014 --> 02:17.299
- Detective.
- Detective.

02:17.301 --> 02:22.438
Dinner was fun.
What about doing it again?

02:22.440 --> 02:25.674
I'm free tonight, as it happens.

02:25.676 --> 02:29.361
Sorry.
Got a case I'm looking at.

02:29.363 --> 02:33.032
Him, actually.
Davidson.

02:33.034 --> 02:35.074
The Internal Affairs cop
went missing last winter.

02:35.075 --> 02:36.202
Did you know him?

02:36.204 --> 02:38.854
Know him?
I had some run-ins with him.

02:38.856 --> 02:39.872
What's your interest?

02:39.874 --> 02:42.458
I got a tip, anonymous.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.660
Said a cop killed him.

02:44.662 --> 02:46.328
Whoa.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.248
Well, maybe he was mixed up
in some HR business.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.300
Maybe an HR cop took him out.

02:51.302 --> 02:55.137
I heard of one group out of
the 51st was offing dealers

02:55.139 --> 02:56.371
and selling their supply.

02:56.373 --> 02:58.173
You got any names?

02:58.175 --> 03:02.094
Most of them are behind bars
or dead, but not all of them.

03:02.096 --> 03:03.679
Will you excuse us?

03:03.681 --> 03:07.733
Detective Carter, we need to talk.

03:07.735 --> 03:10.986
I'll catch up with you later.

03:10.988 --> 03:13.856
So, with HR degraded
to the point of irrelevance,

03:13.858 --> 03:16.775
my team is shifting priorities
back to the man in the suit.

03:16.777 --> 03:19.061
He's still out there.
Do you still want to catch him?

03:19.063 --> 03:21.780
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

03:21.782 --> 03:25.233
We have some new information,

03:25.235 --> 03:27.119
including who he's working for.

03:27.121 --> 03:29.371
Now, the bureau has been
tracking the emergence

03:29.373 --> 03:30.956
of private intelligence networks,

03:30.958 --> 03:33.909
like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.

03:33.911 --> 03:36.629
We think the biggest of these
has Chinese backing.

03:36.631 --> 03:39.465
They've got technology,
serious resources,

03:39.467 --> 03:41.267
and they've been buying up talent.

03:41.269 --> 03:43.085
For instance, we think Mark Snow,

03:43.087 --> 03:44.753
the CIA agent who contacted you,

03:44.755 --> 03:46.055
may also have been recruited,

03:46.057 --> 03:48.307
possibly by the man in the suit.

03:48.309 --> 03:51.310
- Really? Snow?
- Makes sense.

03:51.312 --> 03:53.562
I mean, Snow was sent to
find this man by the CIA.

03:53.564 --> 03:56.148
He catches him, and then
the man in the suit flips him.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.266
Gets snow to be his asset.

03:58.268 --> 04:00.602
Listen, Carter, I want to
read you into this,

04:00.604 --> 04:02.154
but it's classified,

04:02.156 --> 04:03.706
so I've been authorized to offer you

04:03.708 --> 04:05.607
a temporary assignment to the bureau.

04:05.609 --> 04:07.960
And I know, with your skills,

04:07.962 --> 04:09.945
it'll soon become permanent.

04:09.947 --> 04:12.614
Sooner you're on board,
sooner I can fill you in.

04:12.616 --> 04:14.216
So, please, think about it.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.502
I will.
Thank you.

04:19.673 --> 04:22.725
Thanks.

04:22.727 --> 04:24.843
[Phone dialing]

04:24.845 --> 04:26.011
Carter.

04:26.013 --> 04:27.096
Hello, Detective.

04:27.098 --> 04:28.897
I need to find our friend.

04:28.899 --> 04:30.632
We have a big problem.

04:30.634 --> 04:34.019
You'll find him at the
department of city planning.

04:49.318 --> 04:51.198
So he just downloaded
the file and walked out?

04:51.199 --> 04:53.422
Yeah.

04:53.424 --> 04:55.040
Didn't anyone try to stop her?

04:55.042 --> 04:56.925
Apparently nobody noticed.

04:56.927 --> 04:59.628
Detective Carter.
Uh, what do we got?

04:59.630 --> 05:01.780
You heard the 10-31 too,
Detective?

05:01.782 --> 05:04.049
Yep.
So, what is it?

05:04.051 --> 05:06.051
Uh, like we were telling
Marshal Jennings here...

05:06.052 --> 05:08.520
Marshal Jennings, huh?

05:08.522 --> 05:10.522
The manager called it in
'cause one of his staff,

05:10.523 --> 05:12.007
a girl by the name of Abby Monroe,

05:12.009 --> 05:13.675
downloaded a file illegally.

05:13.677 --> 05:15.444
And walked out with it two hours ago.

05:15.446 --> 05:16.979
No one noticed till too late.

05:16.981 --> 05:18.701
Well, does anyone know
what's on the file?

05:18.702 --> 05:20.902
Well, we keep plans here
for some important buildings,

05:20.903 --> 05:23.263
but all she walked out with
were some engineering drawings

05:23.264 --> 05:25.704
for the 1400 block of Hanover
near Wall Street.

05:25.706 --> 05:27.456
It's got
an electrical sub-station,

05:27.458 --> 05:30.525
lawyers' offices, and the HQ
of an investment bank.

05:30.527 --> 05:32.828
Nothing like a critical
infrastructure target.

05:32.830 --> 05:35.030
So, does anyone know where
this Abby Monroe lives?

05:35.032 --> 05:36.415
We ran a check.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.217
The address she gave us is fake.

05:38.219 --> 05:39.718
The phone number is a pay phone.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.255
Hey, solid background check there.

05:43.257 --> 05:44.506
What can I say?

05:44.508 --> 05:46.208
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.376
Kind of disappointing to find
she was a flake.

05:48.378 --> 05:52.398
Kids. You never know.
Right, Detective?

05:52.400 --> 05:53.732
Right.

05:53.734 --> 05:56.819
Anyway, good job,
following up so quickly.

05:56.821 --> 05:58.386
Gentlemen.

05:58.388 --> 05:59.888
Thank you, Marshal.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.608
Uh, look, if you come up
with anything else,

06:02.610 --> 06:05.194
give me a call.

06:05.196 --> 06:06.895
[Whispers]
John. John!

06:06.897 --> 06:08.230
Are you out of your mind?

06:08.232 --> 06:10.565
Impersonating
a law enforcement officer?

06:10.567 --> 06:13.252
Marshal Jennings?
You took his star?

06:13.254 --> 06:15.070
He wasn't using it anymore.

06:15.072 --> 06:16.622
It's great, Carter.

06:16.624 --> 06:18.704
Just flash a badge,
and people tell you everything.

06:18.705 --> 06:19.908
You gotta stop, John.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.845
Donnelly's back, and he's hot
for the man in the suit.

06:22.847 --> 06:24.579
He has a new theory.

06:24.581 --> 06:26.461
Yeah, that I'm working
for China or something.

06:26.462 --> 06:27.966
We heard.

06:27.968 --> 06:30.519
We also heard his offer.

06:30.521 --> 06:34.606
Maybe a transfer to the FBI
would be good for you.

06:34.608 --> 06:37.359
Do you listen to
all of my conversations?

06:37.361 --> 06:38.644
More or less.

06:38.646 --> 06:40.279
You're looking nice, Carter.

06:40.281 --> 06:42.281
Maybe this Cal Beecher
would be good for you too.

06:42.282 --> 06:43.699
Long as he treats you right.

06:43.701 --> 06:45.541
He messes with you,
he'll be hearing from me.

06:45.542 --> 06:46.752
Okay. All right, look.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.154
We're gonna have to set
some boundaries here.

06:49.156 --> 06:50.322
Well, sure.

06:50.324 --> 06:51.773
Things get heavy with you and Cal,

06:51.775 --> 06:53.775
we'll tune out right away.

06:53.777 --> 06:55.377
Never mind.

06:55.379 --> 06:57.779
Um, what's the deal with Abby Monroe?

06:57.781 --> 06:59.631
I was checking to see
she wasn't in trouble.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.083
Looks like I'm a bit late.

07:01.085 --> 07:03.385
Carter, can you get me footage
from that camera

07:03.387 --> 07:04.720
from about two hours ago?

07:04.722 --> 07:06.722
And that camera too?

07:06.724 --> 07:09.675
Thank you.
[Sighs]

07:11.895 --> 07:14.396
There's Abby.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.090
Were you able to trace

07:18.091 --> 07:19.651
the owner of the motorcycle, Detective?

07:19.653 --> 07:21.286
No, because it was stolen

07:21.288 --> 07:24.156
from a second-hand showroom
in Queens four days ago.

07:24.158 --> 07:26.608
I got the camera tapes
out of the robbery squad.

07:26.610 --> 07:29.477
I see the perp is a single male.

07:29.479 --> 07:31.163
You looking at the footage now?

07:31.165 --> 07:32.197
Yes. Why?

07:32.199 --> 07:34.166
No reason.

07:34.168 --> 07:36.502
Blew the locks with det cord.

07:36.504 --> 07:38.120
Ignored the alarms,

07:38.122 --> 07:41.757
'cause he knew he'd be
less than 30 seconds.

07:41.759 --> 07:45.827
He broke the key case
with his bare hand.

07:45.829 --> 07:48.830
Chose his machine.

07:48.832 --> 07:51.600
Whoa.

07:51.602 --> 07:56.338
That's impressive.

07:56.340 --> 07:59.441
What is... what...
what is going on here?

07:59.443 --> 08:02.694
Don't tell me you can see
what's on my computer too.

08:02.696 --> 08:06.231
What did I say
about setting boundaries?

08:12.622 --> 08:14.206
That's a prosthetic hand.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.741
High-end prosthetic,

08:15.743 --> 08:18.544
use of det cord to gain entry
into a building.

08:18.546 --> 08:21.029
My guess, ex-military.

08:21.031 --> 08:22.714
Might explain his connection to Abby.

08:22.716 --> 08:24.499
The question is, what are they doing?

08:24.501 --> 08:26.501
I don't think you're
gonna like the answer.

08:26.503 --> 08:29.254
Comp stat just flagged
my license plate inquiry.

08:29.256 --> 08:30.672
The same motorcycle was seen

08:30.674 --> 08:32.724
on a traffic light camera
near a robbery

08:32.726 --> 08:35.210
at a construction site
in New Jersey three nights ago.

08:35.212 --> 08:36.345
What was stolen?

08:36.347 --> 08:39.063
Explosives.
Semtex.

08:39.066 --> 08:41.482
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.

08:41.485 --> 08:43.485
Let's see, theft of explosives,

08:43.486 --> 08:46.822
theft of engineering plans
for a block on Wall Street.

08:46.824 --> 08:49.024
This guy could be
the next Timothy McVeigh,

08:49.026 --> 08:50.692
and your girl is working with him.

08:50.694 --> 08:53.111
He may have manipulated her
into getting involved.

08:53.113 --> 08:54.580
She's still involved.

08:54.582 --> 08:58.951
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to do my job.

08:58.953 --> 09:02.371
I'm gonna have to put
her name out on an APB.

09:05.925 --> 09:08.510
We've got to find her first.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.935
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55.

09:23.937 --> 09:26.287
You know a Narco detective
named Cal Beecher?

09:26.289 --> 09:27.522
Oh, yeah, sure do.

09:27.524 --> 09:29.090
We used to call him
18-karat Cal.

09:29.092 --> 09:30.438
Better suits, better cars,

09:30.439 --> 09:31.759
better girls than the rest of us.

09:31.761 --> 09:33.378
Maybe he just had better taste.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.896
Or maybe he was on the take.

09:34.898 --> 09:36.314
Did you hear me say that?

09:36.316 --> 09:37.816
Don't know.
What are you saying?

09:37.818 --> 09:40.185
Look, he was undercover narcotics.

09:40.187 --> 09:42.770
A lot of buy-and-busts,
a lot of money hanging around.

09:42.772 --> 09:44.989
Anyway, why you want to know?

09:44.991 --> 09:46.741
Ah, I just been seeing him around.

09:46.743 --> 09:48.703
Yeah. He's been hanging around
Detective Carter.

09:48.704 --> 09:50.829
Bees like honey, Fusco.

09:50.831 --> 09:52.997
Yeah.

09:56.135 --> 09:57.952
I'm just saying, but the way

09:57.954 --> 10:00.071
Abby went off the grid, cut all ties,

10:00.073 --> 10:02.090
she's planning something, Finch.

10:02.092 --> 10:04.459
You think our honor student
wants to blow up Wall Street?

10:04.461 --> 10:06.127
Well, her boyfriend might.

10:06.129 --> 10:08.346
He isn't the first vet
to try something extreme.

10:08.348 --> 10:10.849
We are an odd bunch, Finch.

10:10.851 --> 10:13.852
You are odd, Mr. Reese.
You're also wrong.

10:13.854 --> 10:16.521
If Abby were involved
with domestic terrorism,

10:16.523 --> 10:18.880
which would be a relevant crime,

10:18.881 --> 10:20.441
the machine would have given her number

10:20.443 --> 10:23.144
to... to whoever
now runs that end of things

10:23.146 --> 10:25.280
at the government, not to us.

10:25.282 --> 10:29.033
Whether she's the target
or the source of the threat,

10:29.035 --> 10:30.568
the issues must be personal.

10:30.570 --> 10:32.937
Fine, but what leads
do we have left, Finch?

10:32.939 --> 10:34.656
We have two.

10:34.658 --> 10:37.018
First, the pay phone number
that she gave the temp agency.

10:37.019 --> 10:39.494
It's a street corner in Queens.

10:39.496 --> 10:40.945
The agency must have been able

10:40.947 --> 10:42.580
to contact her there at one point.

10:42.582 --> 10:44.622
It might give you a clue
as to where she's living.

10:44.623 --> 10:47.385
Okay.
And the second lead?

10:47.387 --> 10:49.547
The one stable point
in her life for the last year...

10:49.548 --> 10:51.573
The charity,
Homes For Our Returning Heroes.

10:51.575 --> 10:52.807
I'll check that one out.

10:52.809 --> 10:55.643
Good.
You need to get out more.

10:55.645 --> 10:57.461
You're in a good mood,
Mr. Reese.

10:57.463 --> 10:58.629
I am.

10:58.631 --> 11:00.014
I woke up this morning and felt...

11:00.016 --> 11:01.736
it took me a while to put
my finger on it,

11:01.737 --> 11:02.517
but I felt happy.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.686
Must be this job.

11:04.688 --> 11:07.572
Well, I'm glad.
[Bear barks]

11:07.574 --> 11:09.440
Sorry, Bear.
Not now.

11:09.442 --> 11:11.609
[Bear whines]

11:27.042 --> 11:30.962
Abby tapped into that pay phone.

11:30.964 --> 11:32.497
I think I've found

11:32.499 --> 11:35.016
where our Bonnie and Clyde
have been laying low.

12:15.090 --> 12:19.143
Josh Monroe, Abby's little brother.

12:28.103 --> 12:30.888
I'm an old friend of Abby's family,

12:30.890 --> 12:32.521
and as I was visiting New York,

12:32.522 --> 12:34.442
they asked if I'd try to
find out where Abby is

12:34.444 --> 12:36.377
and why she left her job here.

12:36.379 --> 12:38.196
She never told them?

12:38.198 --> 12:40.448
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.

12:40.450 --> 12:44.118
- Fire her? What on earth for?
- Stealing.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.421
At first, it was just
petty cash, and I let it go,

12:46.423 --> 12:49.540
thinking it was simple
carelessness, but then I found

12:49.542 --> 12:51.626
she was sneaking
into the charity's accounts,

12:51.628 --> 12:55.380
trying to move money around...
significant amounts.

12:55.382 --> 12:57.465
Mr. Chapple,

12:57.467 --> 13:00.134
that really doesn't sound
like the Abby I know.

13:00.136 --> 13:02.086
Well, unfortunately, it's true.

13:02.088 --> 13:05.523
We give low-cost loans to
veterans in financial trouble.

13:05.525 --> 13:07.058
Any hint of a scandal,

13:07.060 --> 13:08.893
and our donations would
just dry right up.

13:08.895 --> 13:11.863
Abby had to go.

13:11.865 --> 13:14.682
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.

13:14.684 --> 13:17.952
If you're watching this,
you'll know I'm in trouble.

13:17.954 --> 13:23.307
I don't think you've really been
mad at me since I was eight,

13:23.309 --> 13:25.971
that time I tied Josh to his skateboard

13:25.972 --> 13:28.012
and pushed him down the hill
in front of our house

13:28.014 --> 13:31.549
to see how fast he would go.

13:31.551 --> 13:36.387
Since then, I've always tried to
be good, keep the rules.

13:36.389 --> 13:39.540
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.

13:39.542 --> 13:44.846
Why? Well, it's complicated
and it's simple.

13:44.848 --> 13:46.848
I'm doing it because it's right,

13:46.850 --> 13:51.986
and I know Josh would agree with me.

13:51.988 --> 13:54.405
He was my little brother,
but I always looked up to him,

13:54.407 --> 13:59.694
and I know
that he would be proud of me,

13:59.696 --> 14:04.799
just like I hope you are
when you know the truth.

14:04.801 --> 14:10.154
I love you, and I hope
you never have to see this.

14:10.156 --> 14:14.125
Any idea why she started stealing?

14:14.127 --> 14:17.762
I believe the trouble started
when she met a former Marine.

14:17.764 --> 14:20.681
Uh, they'd talk
when he came by the offices.

14:20.683 --> 14:24.185
Somehow, he must have made
an impression on Abby,

14:24.187 --> 14:27.688
'cause, just about that time,
she started stealing.

14:27.690 --> 14:30.141
I don't understand.
Why did this Marine come here?

14:30.143 --> 14:31.526
I'm sorry.

14:31.528 --> 14:33.248
We have a strict
confidentiality agreement

14:33.249 --> 14:34.612
with all of our loan recipients.

14:34.614 --> 14:38.449
Suffice it to say,
it was not a pleasant visit.

14:38.451 --> 14:41.018
Could you at least tell me his name?

14:42.438 --> 14:44.071
Corporal Shayn Coleman,

14:44.073 --> 14:46.624
explosives ordinance disposal expert.

14:46.626 --> 14:48.042
Lost his right arm

14:48.044 --> 14:50.912
defusing an IED in Afghanistan
three years ago.

14:50.914 --> 14:52.880
He's our motorcycle thief.

14:52.882 --> 14:55.833
I tracked down Shayn's parents
in his hometown in Ohio.

14:55.835 --> 14:59.053
They haven't seen him
in more than two months.

14:59.055 --> 15:00.638
Did they know he was in trouble?

15:00.640 --> 15:03.307
They said he'd had
his home foreclosed on,

15:03.309 --> 15:05.042
and his fiancee dumped him.

15:05.044 --> 15:07.011
Must be why he went to Chapple...

15:07.013 --> 15:08.729
to ask for another loan.

15:08.731 --> 15:11.048
However it happened,
this is more than enough

15:11.050 --> 15:12.683
to tip someone over the edge.

15:12.685 --> 15:15.987
He's our guy.
I'm adding his name to the APB.

15:15.989 --> 15:18.689
Do what you have to do, Detective.

15:18.691 --> 15:20.942
[Phone beeps]

15:20.944 --> 15:23.027
Finch, are you still there?

15:23.029 --> 15:25.596
Yes.

15:25.598 --> 15:29.534
I'm watching Philip Chapple
meet with two armed men.

15:29.536 --> 15:31.235
What are they like?

15:31.237 --> 15:34.589
Like you, to be honest...
low-key and vaguely menacing.

15:34.591 --> 15:36.574
I suspect he's telling them
to follow me

15:36.576 --> 15:38.009
via the GPS transponder

15:38.011 --> 15:40.461
he slipped into my pocket
as I was leaving.

15:40.463 --> 15:42.547
And where is the transponder now?

15:42.549 --> 15:45.299
It's on a laundry van
with Jersey plates.

15:45.301 --> 15:46.934
Nice work, Finch.

15:46.936 --> 15:49.387
Obviously, Chapple
will take any opportunity

15:49.389 --> 15:51.355
to track Abby down.

15:51.357 --> 15:54.058
What she's planning
must connect to him too.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.740
When the charity closes,
I'll go back in,

15:55.741 --> 15:57.195
see what I can find.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.677
When I said you need to get out more,

15:58.678 --> 15:59.697
I didn't mean that.

15:59.699 --> 16:01.115
Let me take care of it.

16:01.117 --> 16:03.534
No such thing as
a risk-free life, Mr. Reese,

16:03.536 --> 16:05.369
and Abby is still our priority.

16:05.371 --> 16:06.904
You wait for her.

16:06.906 --> 16:08.155
So, I'll go back in,

16:08.157 --> 16:10.358
see what exactly Chapple's hiding.

16:20.452 --> 16:23.087
I'm inside,

16:23.089 --> 16:27.425
but the alarm has been tampered with.

16:27.427 --> 16:30.127
That's because they could be
waiting for you, Harold.

16:30.129 --> 16:31.395
[Loud boom] Ah!

16:31.397 --> 16:34.932
What was that?
Finch, get out now.

16:34.934 --> 16:36.467
Who the hell are you?

16:36.469 --> 16:38.603
Who I am is not important,
Mr. Coleman.

16:38.605 --> 16:41.072
How do you know my name?
What are you doing here?

16:41.074 --> 16:42.640
The same thing as you, I expect,

16:42.642 --> 16:44.275
and since you woke the whole building,

16:44.277 --> 16:46.444
we better hurry.

16:48.163 --> 16:49.363
I'm on my way to you.

16:49.365 --> 16:53.584
Please, just walk away now, Finch.

16:53.586 --> 16:55.253
[Gasps] Shh!

16:55.255 --> 16:56.787
- Who are you?
- It's okay.

16:56.789 --> 16:59.657
- Let go of me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

17:11.169 --> 17:13.054
Finch, get out now.

17:13.056 --> 17:14.256
Don't risk it.
I've got Abby.

17:14.257 --> 17:15.222
Just get out of there.

17:15.223 --> 17:17.023
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.

17:18.843 --> 17:20.394
Please don't do that.

17:20.396 --> 17:23.814
Then get off of me.
Let me go.

17:32.741 --> 17:35.660
[Door opens, closes]

17:38.997 --> 17:41.165
Please, no guns.

17:43.969 --> 17:46.170
[Groans]

17:48.423 --> 17:52.259
Finch, talk to me.
What's happening?

17:52.261 --> 17:55.563
The situation
is evolving, Mr. Reese.

17:57.516 --> 17:58.882
There they go!

17:58.884 --> 18:01.852
Stop right there!

18:05.941 --> 18:07.325
Get on, or they'll kill you!

18:07.327 --> 18:09.193
Get on!

18:09.195 --> 18:11.028
[Grunts]

18:11.030 --> 18:15.866
[Gunfire]

18:15.868 --> 18:17.668
Finch, are you okay?

18:17.670 --> 18:19.954
Aside from riding on a
motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!

18:19.956 --> 18:22.123
I'll be in touch!

18:22.125 --> 18:24.342
Well done.

18:26.128 --> 18:28.462
Hello, Abby.

18:28.464 --> 18:30.598
I'm John.

18:43.842 --> 18:46.511
Okay, you should leave now,

18:46.513 --> 18:49.414
because my boyfriend's
gonna be here any minute.

18:49.416 --> 18:51.716
Your boyfriend, Shayn?

18:51.718 --> 18:54.185
I don't know how
you know that, but yes,

18:54.187 --> 18:57.238
and he's a Marine,
so you do not want to meet him.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.990
Actually, I do want to meet him,

18:58.992 --> 19:00.575
but first things first.

19:00.577 --> 19:02.537
What does that message
to your mom and dad mean?

19:02.538 --> 19:03.828
What?

19:03.830 --> 19:05.830
You broke into my room
and went through my stuff?

19:05.831 --> 19:08.416
Get out, or I'm...

19:08.418 --> 19:11.085
What?
You'll call the police?

19:11.087 --> 19:14.205
I know about the building plans
and the explosives.

19:14.207 --> 19:17.125
I knew it.
You work for Chapple.

19:17.127 --> 19:19.961
No, but I'm interested
to know why you and Shayn

19:19.963 --> 19:21.745
are going after him.

19:21.747 --> 19:24.715
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief,

19:24.717 --> 19:26.717
and I'm not saying another word

19:26.719 --> 19:29.554
until you tell me who you are.

19:29.556 --> 19:33.191
I'm here to stop you from
getting into even more trouble.

19:33.193 --> 19:35.109
Not what I asked.

19:35.111 --> 19:38.729
Who are you?

19:38.731 --> 19:40.448
I find it hard to answer that,

19:40.450 --> 19:45.102
even to myself.

19:45.104 --> 19:48.906
I was a soldier once,
like your brother Josh.

19:48.908 --> 19:53.461
But I was lucky.
I made it out.

19:53.463 --> 19:55.797
- Mr, Reese?
- Yes, Finch. What's happening?

19:55.799 --> 19:58.533
I've explained to Shayn
that we're trying to help him.

19:58.535 --> 20:00.117
Did he believe you?

20:00.119 --> 20:03.171
No, especially when I told him
that you have Abby.

20:03.173 --> 20:05.773
Things are a little tense.

20:05.775 --> 20:08.759
Let me talk to him.

20:13.315 --> 20:14.816
Who is this?

20:14.818 --> 20:17.235
You know, Abby keeps
asking me the same thing.

20:17.237 --> 20:19.103
It's really not important.

20:19.105 --> 20:21.138
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.

20:21.140 --> 20:25.409
The same goes for you and my friend.

20:25.411 --> 20:28.746
We should meet.

20:32.417 --> 20:35.586
Once you leave with Shayn,
I can't protect you anymore.

20:35.588 --> 20:38.089
I never asked you to
protect me in the first place.

20:38.091 --> 20:40.658
Whatever you're planning,
I know why, Abby.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.126
You couldn't save your brother,

20:42.128 --> 20:45.763
so you're trying to save Shayn.

20:45.765 --> 20:48.933
I understand that, truly.

20:48.935 --> 20:51.335
I'd feel the same way.

20:51.337 --> 20:54.305
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?

20:54.307 --> 20:58.192
Nothing I can't handle,
but he nearly destroyed Shayn.

20:58.194 --> 21:00.278
- By lending him money?
- Yes.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.029
Chapple made him a loan.

21:02.031 --> 21:04.232
The interest rates tripled in a year.

21:04.234 --> 21:06.517
No one could keep up those payments.

21:06.519 --> 21:08.352
Millions of people lost their homes.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.405
They don't go around
stealing explosives.

21:11.407 --> 21:12.657
Shayn should move on.

21:12.659 --> 21:15.493
He lost his home and his fiancee.

21:15.495 --> 21:18.162
He even introduced some of
his buddies to Chapple,

21:18.164 --> 21:20.047
one of whom shot himself

21:20.049 --> 21:22.366
on the porch of the house
he no longer owned.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.418
Should he move on from that?

21:24.420 --> 21:26.971
Look, I went through Chapple's files.

21:26.973 --> 21:28.389
I saw what he was doing.

21:28.391 --> 21:29.840
There are hundreds,

21:29.842 --> 21:33.010
hundreds of soldiers
who lost their homes.

21:33.012 --> 21:36.430
[Motorcycle approaching]

21:44.189 --> 21:47.408
What are you gonna do, Abby?

21:47.410 --> 21:49.893
The right thing.

21:49.895 --> 21:52.580
Can I go now?

22:00.739 --> 22:04.208
I assume you put a tracker on him.

22:04.210 --> 22:08.245
Rather a clever one,
if I do say so myself.

22:08.247 --> 22:11.749
His prosthetic arm is controlled
by myoelectric sensors

22:11.751 --> 22:13.935
by way of a wireless link,

22:13.937 --> 22:18.189
so I cloned the link
and reprogrammed it

22:18.191 --> 22:21.692
to attempt a forced pair with
every cell phone they pass.

22:21.694 --> 22:24.862
Leaving a nice GPS trail.

22:24.864 --> 22:26.480
Well done, Finch.

22:26.482 --> 22:28.733
Especially on the back
of a speeding motorcycle,

22:28.735 --> 22:31.702
which was exhilarating, by the way.

22:31.704 --> 22:35.406
I might have to get myself one.

22:41.580 --> 22:43.481
Working late?

22:43.483 --> 22:47.117
Uh, yeah. Um...
[Laughs]

22:47.119 --> 22:49.720
It's always something, you know?

22:51.089 --> 22:54.458
Yeah.
Is something wrong, Carter?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.794
Donnelly made me an offer today.

22:56.796 --> 22:59.647
What, I got competition?
From that guy?

22:59.649 --> 23:01.131
No, not that sort of offer.

23:01.133 --> 23:06.237
He, um, invited me to join the FBI.

23:06.239 --> 23:08.739
Could be a good move.

23:08.741 --> 23:11.242
I mean, yeah, small fish in a big pond,

23:11.244 --> 23:13.577
but think of the prospects,
Carter, and the money.

23:13.579 --> 23:14.996
You should do it.

23:14.998 --> 23:16.998
But what about my kid?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.483
I mean,
it... it'll probably mean

23:19.485 --> 23:21.952
I have to move out of New York.

23:21.954 --> 23:23.654
You mean I'd never see you again?

23:23.656 --> 23:24.755
[Laughs]

23:24.757 --> 23:28.325
[Phone rings]

23:28.327 --> 23:30.544
It's Cal.

23:31.996 --> 23:35.049
No problem.
I'll see you then.

23:36.351 --> 23:38.886
Uh, now what were we talking about?

23:38.888 --> 23:41.138
About never seeing me again.

23:41.140 --> 23:44.642
Right.

23:44.644 --> 23:46.360
[Over recording] It's Cal.

23:46.362 --> 23:48.846
Cal, Alonzo Quinn.
Can we meet?

23:48.848 --> 23:50.948
Tyrell Park.
Say, 30 minutes?

23:50.950 --> 23:53.451
No problem.

23:57.873 --> 23:59.990
I'm hoping you can help me out, Cal.

23:59.992 --> 24:01.692
Any way I can,
Mr. Quinn.

24:01.694 --> 24:06.580
The Mayor has seen this
crime spike in Crown Heights...

24:06.582 --> 24:09.667
drug busts, uh, burglaries,
even homicides.

24:09.669 --> 24:11.419
He wants me to find out
what's happening.

24:11.421 --> 24:14.088
I told him I got a godson
who's got his ear to the ground.

24:14.090 --> 24:15.723
So, do you?

24:15.725 --> 24:18.542
Crown Heights, yeah.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.210
We think it's a Russian, Peter Yogorov.

24:20.212 --> 24:23.481
Used to work Brighton Beach
till Elias kicked him out.

24:23.483 --> 24:26.067
We believe he's pulling strings
from the inside,

24:26.069 --> 24:28.436
working to take over the Heights.

24:28.438 --> 24:32.239
Boo.

24:32.241 --> 24:34.024
What are you doing here, Simmons?

24:34.026 --> 24:36.610
I'm keeping an eye on you,
you slippery little mutt.

24:36.612 --> 24:38.162
What are you doing?

24:38.164 --> 24:41.165
None of your business.

24:41.167 --> 24:43.117
You're following Cal Beecher.

24:43.119 --> 24:44.952
You're checking him out for Carter?

24:44.954 --> 24:47.671
No, I've been wondering

24:47.673 --> 24:50.174
who else you've been
flapping your gums to.

24:50.176 --> 24:52.910
About you burying Davidson?

24:52.912 --> 24:56.079
Not Beecher.
Not yet.

24:56.081 --> 24:58.632
You crossed a line when you
made that call to Carter,

24:58.634 --> 25:00.634
pointing her towards me
in the Davidson murder.

25:00.636 --> 25:02.553
What line is that?

25:02.555 --> 25:05.306
The line where I don't
give a crap anymore.

25:05.308 --> 25:09.259
So watch your back.

25:09.261 --> 25:12.696
You know how many times
I've heard that?

25:12.698 --> 25:18.068
And here I am, beautiful as ever.

25:18.070 --> 25:20.871
Go home, Fusco.

25:29.765 --> 25:32.333
What are you doing here, Simmons?

25:32.335 --> 25:34.835
I said, go home.

25:39.391 --> 25:41.091
There's our cell phone trail.

25:41.093 --> 25:42.560
It looks like Abby and Shayn

25:42.562 --> 25:44.311
are heading
for the 1400 block of Hanover.

25:44.313 --> 25:45.946
Question is, what's there?

25:45.948 --> 25:48.449
I've listed every
business name on the block,

25:48.451 --> 25:52.436
cross-checking against the
download of Chapple's computer.

25:52.438 --> 25:56.340
Bingo. An investment bank,
Merton Watts.

25:56.342 --> 25:57.942
Maybe he has an account there.

25:57.944 --> 25:59.693
[Keys clacking]

25:59.695 --> 26:02.329
Not according to his computer records.

26:02.331 --> 26:04.665
- Then a safe deposit box?
- What would he keep in it?

26:04.667 --> 26:06.984
According to his accounts,
Chapple's not rich.

26:06.986 --> 26:08.546
Abby said hundreds of the loans he made

26:08.547 --> 26:09.870
were foreclosed on.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.632
If he's getting kickbacks
from the banks...

26:11.633 --> 26:12.656
You may be right.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.208
Merton Watts has first lien

26:14.210 --> 26:16.844
on any properties
Chapple loans money on.

26:16.846 --> 26:19.180
That means they handle
all foreclosure sales.

26:19.182 --> 26:20.848
And split the profits with Chapple,

26:20.850 --> 26:23.634
which he keeps in his
safe deposit box at the bank.

26:23.636 --> 26:26.003
That's what Abby and Shayn are after.

26:26.005 --> 26:28.639
Why is she doing this?
For Shayn?

26:28.641 --> 26:30.941
Yes.
And for her brother.

26:30.943 --> 26:32.977
She still feels a debt.

26:32.979 --> 26:37.615
The dead have a power
like that, as you know.

26:37.617 --> 26:39.683
So, how are they going to do this?

26:39.685 --> 26:41.652
Semtex and building plans.

26:41.654 --> 26:44.321
They'll find a soft entry point

26:44.323 --> 26:47.190
and blast their way into the vault.

26:47.192 --> 26:49.293
I like these kids.

26:49.295 --> 26:51.011
I'd like them to live.

26:51.013 --> 26:54.748
Please try to get to them
before Chapple's thugs do.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.917
[Static]

26:56.919 --> 26:58.969
System's back up.

26:58.971 --> 27:00.304
They get anything from the safe?

27:00.306 --> 27:03.007
The box code and the keys.

27:03.009 --> 27:04.889
But there's no way they can
get into the vault

27:04.890 --> 27:05.770
at the bank, is there?

27:05.771 --> 27:07.061
What do you think?

27:07.063 --> 27:08.646
Police band says they stole explosives

27:08.648 --> 27:09.897
and engineering plans.

27:09.899 --> 27:12.516
Well, get down there.
Deal with them.

27:12.518 --> 27:14.935
You have to pay for another man.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.403
It's a big area to cover.

27:16.405 --> 27:20.107
Whatever you need.
Just finish it.

27:32.550 --> 27:35.468
Carter, I need to see you immediately.

27:40.925 --> 27:42.842
Can I have your phone?

27:42.844 --> 27:44.811
What's going on, Donnelly?

27:44.813 --> 27:48.148
I'm sorry, but I think the
organization our man works for

27:48.150 --> 27:51.451
has some sophisticated capabilities.

27:51.453 --> 27:54.454
Like wire-tapping cops?

27:54.456 --> 27:55.772
Has something happened?

27:55.774 --> 27:58.107
I think we got our break.

27:58.109 --> 28:01.611
The man in the suit was involved
in a robbery at a charity

28:01.613 --> 28:02.913
on the Upper East Side.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.280
How do you know that?

28:04.282 --> 28:06.182
Now, before I can let you in,
I have to know

28:06.184 --> 28:08.785
if you'll accept the temporary
assignment to the bureau.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.922
Okay, yes.

28:11.924 --> 28:15.091
Good.
You won't regret it.

28:15.093 --> 28:18.845
So, we've been tracking
this man for ten months.

28:18.847 --> 28:20.096
Every time we get close,

28:20.098 --> 28:21.765
he slips right out from under us,

28:21.767 --> 28:23.483
as if he has some guardian angel.

28:23.485 --> 28:28.104
All I've looked for since then
is a lead, any lead,

28:28.106 --> 28:31.024
and then I realized, the phone.

28:31.026 --> 28:33.827
He's in constant communication
with his handlers.

28:33.829 --> 28:35.362
I thought of that.

28:35.364 --> 28:37.204
Cross-checked crime scenes
he was reported at

28:37.205 --> 28:38.748
with cell tower logs of IMEIs.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.284
- Came up with nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

28:41.286 --> 28:44.148
Our engineers at Quantico
analyzed the cell tower traffic

28:44.149 --> 28:45.989
from that night he gave us
the slip downtown.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.358
Under the wireless and radio noise,

28:48.360 --> 28:51.494
they found short bursts
of a cloned IMEI

28:51.496 --> 28:53.964
with a unique signature.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.486
I tasked an FBI computer cluster
to search for that signature.

28:56.487 --> 28:58.668
24 hours ago, the cluster came online.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.705
It spotted another burst
of cloned imeis

29:01.707 --> 29:03.773
at the exact time
and location of the robbery.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.174
It's him.

29:05.176 --> 29:07.176
I've got SWAT teams standing by.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.729
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.

29:29.700 --> 29:34.087
Abby, this is far enough.

29:34.089 --> 29:35.722
I'll handle this from here.

29:35.724 --> 29:37.206
I'll meet you back at the apartment.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.426
No.
No, together or nothing.

29:39.428 --> 29:41.177
You've risked enough, Abby.

29:41.179 --> 29:43.146
This isn't your fight right now.

29:43.148 --> 29:46.382
This is my fight.
You're my fight.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.440
I wouldn't do that.

30:27.442 --> 30:28.858
Or that.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.278
Now, the truth...

30:32.280 --> 30:35.982
or I take you to the cops myself.

30:35.984 --> 30:38.068
I know you're here
to steal Chapple's money.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.153
What then?

30:40.155 --> 30:42.872
We want to give it back to
the people he stole it from.

30:42.874 --> 30:45.158
How?

30:45.160 --> 30:49.079
We haven't thought that far ahead.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.064
You haven't thought very far at all.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.749
Now, why not go to the cops
or a lawyer?

30:52.751 --> 30:54.317
Abby did.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.619
She went to the DA,
but Chapple got there first,

30:56.621 --> 30:57.971
spread his poison.

30:57.973 --> 30:59.806
The DA even threatened to prosecute her

30:59.808 --> 31:01.057
for theft and slander.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.642
When I got to my apartment,

31:02.644 --> 31:04.260
one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.

31:04.262 --> 31:05.845
He beat me up.

31:05.847 --> 31:07.931
He said if I said another word,

31:07.933 --> 31:13.403
he would come back
and put a bullet in my head.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.489
I assume the bank's through there?

31:16.491 --> 31:18.658
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.493
John, this has gone far enough.

31:20.495 --> 31:21.811
Has it, Finch?

31:21.813 --> 31:23.813
Yes. Stop them.
I can deal with Chapple.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.398
Chapple hurt them, Finch.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.951
They tried the law.
The law wasn't interested.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.452
What have they got left?

31:29.454 --> 31:32.505
Besides, I've always had a thing

31:32.507 --> 31:34.674
about people who screw with veterans.

31:34.676 --> 31:35.825
John, it's far too risky.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.177
What did you say, Harold?

31:37.179 --> 31:41.297
No such thing
as a risk-free life.

31:41.299 --> 31:42.498
Let's do it.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.968

This is where
the safe deposit boxes are.

32:08.076 --> 32:09.476

32:09.477 --> 32:10.577
from inside the bank,

32:10.579 --> 32:12.745
so we decided to bring them to us.

32:12.747 --> 32:15.865
You're gonna blow the roof.

32:23.557 --> 32:26.009
We got something here.

John, what's your situation?

32:29.064 --> 32:30.930
Ten more minutes.

32:30.932 --> 32:33.549
I'm seeing what I can only describe

32:33.551 --> 32:36.319
as interference on our phone link.

32:36.321 --> 32:37.887
Is it Root?

No, it's a broad spectrum sweep,

32:42.244 --> 32:43.493
Root's more subtle than that.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.061
It must be our FBI friend.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.330
Stay off the line
and please get out now.

leave them.

and they're bringing down
a very bad man.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.006
Now, isn't that what
your experiment's all about?

32:57.008 --> 32:58.925
My experiment is about stopping people

32:58.927 --> 33:01.044
from getting killed, not robbing banks.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.579
