00:41.809 --> 00:44.000
I just can't believe
this is the last time

00:44.012 --> 00:45.595
I'll walk into this building and say,

00:46.247 --> 00:47.933
"Good Morning, Misty."

00:53.287 --> 00:54.905
"Good morning, Misty."

00:56.124 --> 00:57.337
You've got a thing.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.103
In your...

01:00.128 --> 01:02.217
Where? Oh, God.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.149
[Misty] Weirdo.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.354
[Lloyd] Paraguay.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.374
HBW000337890.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.996
Yep. Gotcha.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.052
[Mort] Well! If it isn't
another misty morning!

01:31.059 --> 01:33.148
Misty freaking morning.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.475
How goes it, Misty-kins?

01:34.495 --> 01:36.686
It's the same as it always goes, Mort.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.679
Doofus.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.328
[Rico]
Okay. Uh, Finland.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.702
HBW00837

01:52.546 --> 01:54.097
2717.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.462
[Misty] Finland.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.135
Yeah. Finland.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.343
I've always loved the
way you say "Finland."

02:00.354 --> 02:03.084
It's like, "Fin. Land."

02:03.457 --> 02:04.603
Thanks.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.739
You know what's funny.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.345
Godfrey's closing after all these years,

02:08.362 --> 02:09.710
and you and me never

02:09.729 --> 02:12.225
got the chance to, you know.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.716
To?

02:17.305 --> 02:19.461
I thought you knew. I'm married.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.091
Your wife doesn't need to know!

02:22.176 --> 02:23.996
There's a broom closet
on the second floor.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.231
It's very roomy.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.470
Is this woman harassing you again, Rico?

02:32.153 --> 02:34.276
I'm fine, Lloyd. Let's
just get out of here.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.336
[Jason] Told ya.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.373
Eat shit, Jason.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.051
Jackass.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.398
(upbeat jazz music)

02:54.775 --> 02:56.393
(bell ringing)

02:58.246 --> 03:00.066
It is time to begin working.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.142
(upbeat jazz music)

05:53.854 --> 05:55.505
(bell ringing)

05:56.290 --> 05:57.840
It is time to stop working.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.553
[Misty]
Esther said to wait here. She said,

06:04.565 --> 06:06.385
Mr. Godfrey wants to
speak with us personally.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.228
Oh! He wants to say goodbye!

06:09.670 --> 06:11.389
[Jason] Oh, I'm thinking
fat severance bonuses.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.360
Bonuses should be based on tenure.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.890
Bonuses should be based on talent.

06:14.908 --> 06:15.953
Loyalty is more important.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.594
Innovation is more important.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.521
Ass-kissing's pretty high up there, too.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.265
And as master of the butt smooch, Jason.

06:20.281 --> 06:21.865
I do not kiss ass, okay?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.276
I strategize self-actionization moments.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.832
It's all in Steve's seminars.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.673
Your "shaman" is named "Steve"?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.521
Mr. Godfrey!

06:45.038 --> 06:47.398
Jason Tumley, warehousing associate.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.887
I just want to say,

06:49.443 --> 06:51.768
what an honor and a privilege

06:51.779 --> 06:54.441
it has been toiling in your shadow.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.401
Which, actually, hasn't even

06:57.418 --> 06:58.732
really been like a shadow.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.831
It's more like a

07:00.988 --> 07:03.987
white hot sun illuminating the...

07:03.991 --> 07:05.440
Ow!

07:05.459 --> 07:06.672
Thank you very much,
Jason, for that speech.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.581
It contained words,

07:09.697 --> 07:11.820
verbs, nouns, and so forth.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.023
So huzzah to you, lad!

07:17.070 --> 07:18.756
And now on to business.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.400
I know you're all waiting for some

07:23.711 --> 07:25.497
envelopes.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.390
Yes?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.812
You all love envelopes. Right?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.483
[Mort]
It's really not the envelopes.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.380
It's the stuff inside.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.473
That's exactly the
robust spirit that's kept

07:41.495 --> 07:42.910
Godfrey Global Inventory

07:42.930 --> 07:44.514
alive and kicking all these years.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.957
Until tonight when it finally,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.824
finally dies.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.608
So, anyway, Esther, envelopes.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.904
(bouncy music)

08:09.690 --> 08:11.813
[Mort]
It's an invitation.

08:12.393 --> 08:13.674
To a party.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.581
Oh Jesus tits.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.428
In honor of your loyal years of service

08:19.433 --> 08:21.590
to Godfrey Global Inventory,

08:22.603 --> 08:23.917
Esther and I,

08:24.538 --> 08:26.527
request the pleasure of your company

08:27.541 --> 08:29.530
at a farewell soiree

08:29.843 --> 08:32.067
to be held here tonight.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.604
We've never been to a party before.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.505
We've never been to a party before.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.068
You've never been to a party before?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.907
No, we've never been to a party before.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.809
And because we've never been

08:43.823 --> 08:46.385
to a party before this will be

08:46.394 --> 08:50.100
the finest party we've ever thrown!

08:53.100 --> 08:54.920
[Janet]
Oh, come on, guys!

08:54.935 --> 08:56.586
Come on, let's embrace this.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.390
I mean, this is our last day.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.456
Our last day!

09:00.474 --> 09:02.058
I mean, we've all worked here for?

09:02.075 --> 09:04.064
11 years.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.430
Seven years.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.670
14 years.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.904
Talent matters more than tenure.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.841
All these years, and what have we

09:14.855 --> 09:16.574
ever really learned about each other?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.408
Or about Mr. Godfrey?

09:18.426 --> 09:21.593
Or his lovely twin sister, Esther?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.657
Or about Godfrey Global
Inventory itself?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.687
Its purpose, its function.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.419
I mean, the raison d'etre

09:28.436 --> 09:30.019
for the thousands of punchcards.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.756
And so on and so
forth, Janet, thank you.

09:35.509 --> 09:38.003
So. Party tonight?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.430
Where's our checks?

09:41.682 --> 09:44.480
Final checks will be
distributed at the party.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.404
Can you just, like, mail mine?

09:50.524 --> 09:52.950
Well, we could, "just, like, mail" yours

09:53.861 --> 09:55.681
if you decline tonight's invitation.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.560
However, party attendance is mandatory

09:58.566 --> 10:00.992
in order to receive Godfrey Global's

10:01.001 --> 10:04.608
additional severance bonus,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.997
which is quite generous.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.668
Quite generous.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.902
[Jason]
So, if we don't go to the party,

10:16.917 --> 10:18.603
then we don't get our bonuses?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.669
Whip smart, that one.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.136
After 11 years of
"manning the carts" here

10:22.155 --> 10:24.481
at Godfrey, I would be honored

10:24.492 --> 10:26.243
to hoist a couple of tall cold ones.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.776
You wanna talk honored?

10:27.795 --> 10:30.019
I mean, my bowels clench with pride

10:30.030 --> 10:31.580
when this man, when this,

10:32.866 --> 10:35.697
when this, when this fella right here

10:35.936 --> 10:38.092
inspired me in my brief...

10:38.105 --> 10:40.498
So! 7:06 sharp.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.935
[Janet] I'm only gonna
be gone a few hours,

10:49.950 --> 10:52.106
Nana, you'll be fine by yourself.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.642
[Nana]
I'm actually glad you're going out.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.734
Really?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.002
[Nana]
That way you won't

10:57.024 --> 10:58.877
have to hear my screams.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.712
There will be no screaming tonight.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.646
You're right.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.652
They'll probably ball gag
me right from the get-go.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.687
Nana, no one's going
to ball gag you, okay?

11:06.700 --> 11:09.059
Not if they slit my throat first.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.291
Then they can steal
my silver tea service

11:11.304 --> 11:13.698
in peace and quiet while I bleed out.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.819
You know, it's a shame

11:14.842 --> 11:16.290
you've never met Mr. Godfrey!

11:16.309 --> 11:18.096
You're the same age!

11:18.111 --> 11:19.595
Though he sure doesn't look 80,

11:19.613 --> 11:20.894
it's the weirdest thing.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.161
[Nana]
All those murderers

11:22.182 --> 11:23.767
have baby faces.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.703
He's my age?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.514
Janet? Can I come to the party?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.641
Showering, I can't hear you!

11:32.660 --> 11:33.974
[Nana] JANET!

11:34.695 --> 11:36.211
Yes, I know. I've watched it.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.814
I'm watching it right now.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.145
[Shaman Steve]
Actionization is about establishing

11:39.166 --> 11:41.255
your masculine potential
as a shamanic warrior.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.195
Squat low. Breathe hot. YAAAAHR

11:44.705 --> 11:47.940
Steve, I do. I do breathe
the warrior fire, okay.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.222
I breathe it actionizingly,

11:49.242 --> 11:50.961
but even the warrior fire,

11:50.978 --> 11:52.224
it can't stop my employer
from closing up shop.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.259
You're right. You're
right, you're right,

11:55.282 --> 11:58.315
but maybe now that Godfrey's is gone

11:59.252 --> 12:01.612
maybe the universe is telling me

12:01.622 --> 12:03.171
to take it to the next level, you know?

12:03.190 --> 12:05.178
Go full shaman and start
teaching other warriors

12:05.192 --> 12:06.304
to breathe the warrior fire, and...

12:06.326 --> 12:07.641
What?

12:09.863 --> 12:11.144
Right now?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.620
Okay, okay. Just hold on.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.342
YAAAAAAHR!!!

12:33.286 --> 12:34.972
Is it "yahr" or is it "aar?"

12:34.988 --> 12:36.033
'Cause I can never... Oh, shit!

12:37.925 --> 12:39.171
[Male radio announcer]
Whether you seek ultimate

12:39.192 --> 12:41.687
relaxation, or ultimate excitement.

12:41.695 --> 12:44.020
[Female radio announcer]
The Ambergris Islands await you.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.311

12:47.801 --> 12:49.823

The Ambergris Islands await you.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.937
[Male radio announcer]
Sultry days and steamy nights.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.265
[Female radio announcer]
The Ambergris Islands await you.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.994
[Male radio announcer]
So what are you waiting for?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.797
[Female radio annoncer]
So what are you waiting for?

12:58.812 --> 12:59.722
[Disclaimer radio announcer]
All-inclusive resort

12:59.747 --> 13:01.903
packages start at just $1,500.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.879
[Female Radio Announcer]
The Ambergris Islands await you.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.705
What are you waiting for?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.878
[Mort]
They say that the squeaky wheel

13:14.895 --> 13:16.682
gets the grease.

13:16.697 --> 13:19.022
Well, I may not have
been the squeakiest wheel

13:19.032 --> 13:22.065
during my 11 years tenure

13:22.069 --> 13:24.192
here at Godfrey Global Inventory.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.653
But then I'm the kind of guy

13:25.673 --> 13:27.695
who will bend over
backwards for my employer,

13:27.708 --> 13:29.932
whether or not he greases me up.

13:30.778 --> 13:32.428
I'll take on any size workload,

13:32.445 --> 13:35.142
and I've taken some pretty darn big ones

13:35.148 --> 13:37.676
during my 11 years tenure

13:37.685 --> 13:40.144
here at Godfrey Global Inventory. So.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.849
Thank you, Mr. Godfrey,
for being my employer

13:43.857 --> 13:46.654
all these 11 years of my tenure

13:47.394 --> 13:49.651
here at Godfrey Global Inventory.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.887
How was that, Donald?

13:59.907 --> 14:01.052
Did Daddy make a good speech?

14:01.809 --> 14:03.426
Yes. Good boy. Yes.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.062
Yes, I know.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.308
(dance music)

14:46.519 --> 14:48.137
Hey.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.720
So glad you could make
it this evening, Janet.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.820
Oh, thank you, Mr. Godfrey,

15:05.839 --> 15:06.850
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

15:06.874 --> 15:08.356
Are you enjoying the gum?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.329
Yes, it's wonderful. Thank you.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.995
Here. Have another.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.124
No, thanks. I'm okay.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.326
I insist!

15:16.049 --> 15:17.296
Okay.

15:20.821 --> 15:21.966
No, no, I.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.271
Chew to your heart's content!

15:26.193 --> 15:28.316
Tonight is a special night!

15:29.496 --> 15:31.518
You are so right, Mr. Godfrey.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.313
Tonight is special.

15:33.901 --> 15:35.147
But then again,

15:35.168 --> 15:36.516
every moment of my employment

15:36.536 --> 15:39.400
here at Godfrey Global has been special.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.495
They say that the squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.872
Well, I may not have
been the squeakiest wheel

15:46.880 --> 15:47.992
during my 11...

15:48.015 --> 15:49.969
Hmmm. Party games!

15:50.350 --> 15:52.137
[Godfrey] Excellent.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.871
Thank you, Esther, for
keeping us on schedule.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.234
This portion of the evening

15:56.256 --> 15:58.513
has been allotted to party games.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.514
Tonight's party game shall be

16:02.462 --> 16:04.383
"Duck Duck Goose."

16:08.001 --> 16:09.450
You're not serious.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.222
But this is a party.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.586
It is my understanding that seriousness

16:13.606 --> 16:16.471
would be inappropriate at this event.

16:17.945 --> 16:20.101
Touché, Mr. G! Right?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.132
When do we get our checks?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.429
This is not the question-and-answer

16:23.450 --> 16:25.034
period of the evening.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.973
That's at 5:13 a.m.

16:28.922 --> 16:29.596
You're kidding, right?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.139
No-one's gonna be here at 5 a.m.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.047
[Janet]
You know, I just think it's wonderful

16:35.062 --> 16:36.983
that two people who have never been

16:36.997 --> 16:38.986
to a party before are
bending over backwards

16:38.999 --> 16:41.089
to make sure we have a good time.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.938
So I say, bring on
the "Duck Duck Goose!"

16:47.140 --> 16:50.342
Duck, Duck, Duck.

16:51.879 --> 16:52.890
GOOSE!

16:53.947 --> 16:55.902
Oh my god. GO.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.229
This is ridiculous.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.397
I have a heart condition, you know!

17:17.503 --> 17:18.346
Duck.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.990
Duck.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.487
Duck.

17:26.679 --> 17:27.993
Goose.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.241
The hell with this!

17:41.394 --> 17:43.484
Mort is not using his indoor voice.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.116
I've used my indoor voice

17:46.133 --> 17:48.390
for far too long, Mr. Godfrey!

17:50.103 --> 17:51.485
I've bent over backwards,

17:51.504 --> 17:53.089
and you've never greased me up

17:53.106 --> 17:54.420
to take on your big workload!

17:54.441 --> 17:56.935
And, and, and now

17:57.444 --> 18:00.342
my 11-year tenure here at
Godfrey Global Inventory

18:00.347 --> 18:02.907
has come to an end and I'm ready to

18:05.418 --> 18:06.901
go home.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.602
So, you can hand me my pay check

18:08.621 --> 18:10.677
and I'll mosey proudly along,

18:10.690 --> 18:13.521
because obviously, I'm
not appreciated here.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.550
I'd prefer if you stayed
until the party ended.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.149
[Mort]
The party ended for me

18:20.467 --> 18:24.006
a long time ago, Mr. Godfrey.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.124
[Misty]
Can I get my check too?

18:27.975 --> 18:29.188
Very well, then.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.464
I'll give you your check now.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.107
Thank you.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.153
But, that means that I'll have to

18:49.162 --> 18:51.689
punch your card and move it

18:54.434 --> 18:56.456
to the "Dormant Accounts" file.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.356
Let's see here.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.238
Janet, Jason,

19:05.545 --> 19:08.409
Misty, Mort.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.732
So, if I leave you're going to?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.604
[Godfrey] Process your card,
and move it from

19:13.620 --> 19:15.709
"Active" to "Dormant" status.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.445
To make your termination official.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.490
Punch my card.
Goodbye, everyone.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.429
[Godfrey]
Gee, Mort. What's wrong?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.628
Nothing. I'm fine!

19:39.812 --> 19:41.498
[Jason]
You okay there, big guy?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.299
Did you take your heart medicine, Mort?

19:43.316 --> 19:44.462
[Misty]
You should sit down, Morty.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.372
[Godfrey]
Nonsense, he's fine, see?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.638
Anyhow.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.216
AAAAAH!

19:56.229 --> 19:58.285
[Misty
Mort! Snap out of it!

19:58.631 --> 20:01.126
[Esther] That is an unauthorized
first aid procedure.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.785
I shall file an incident report.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.319
[Janet] Call 911!

20:05.372 --> 20:06.820
Mort!

20:06.839 --> 20:08.356
Damn it!

20:08.375 --> 20:10.060
Non-business related calls must be

20:10.077 --> 20:11.660
pre-approved by the management!

20:14.681 --> 20:16.366
[Misty] Oh! Oh my God!

20:16.816 --> 20:19.715
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

20:25.525 --> 20:27.681
Augh, Jason!

20:27.694 --> 20:29.345
You took the CPR course! C'mere.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.384
Mr. Godfrey, we have to call 911!

20:37.137 --> 20:38.249
[Jason] Check his pulse!

20:38.271 --> 20:39.484
Mr. Godfrey, please!

20:39.506 --> 20:42.774
[Godfrey]
He's. Already. Dead. Janet.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.464
[Misty]
Oh my god. He is dead.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.773
Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:56.156 --> 20:59.087
Oh my God! Oh my God,
it's a million dollars!

20:59.826 --> 21:01.477
It's a million dollars!

21:04.131 --> 21:05.680
Don't stop!

21:06.566 --> 21:08.116
[Godfrey]
I hope Mort's cat makes

21:08.135 --> 21:10.123
good use of its inheritance.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.760
Lucky, lucky Donald.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.394
Our severance bonus
is a million dollars?

21:17.410 --> 21:19.870
With one small caveat, I'm afraid.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.774
Godfrey Global has one
last batch of inventory

21:23.783 --> 21:26.445
that must be processed
before the deadline.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.870
What deadline?

21:29.356 --> 21:30.602
[Godfrey] The deadline.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.314
When we "shut 'er down."

21:34.427 --> 21:35.775
The End.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.143
The deadline.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.444
So, when's the deadline?

21:50.210 --> 21:53.344
Dawn. Dawn is the deadline.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.735
So. So, you tricked us into

21:56.749 --> 21:58.435
coming here to work overnight?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.369
No, no tricks.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.807
We invited you to a party.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.227
This is a party.
Note the garlands.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.747
So, if we finish processing

22:08.761 --> 22:10.514
the inventory before dawn,

22:10.530 --> 22:12.855
we each get a million dollars? Really?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.218
[Jason] Awesome.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.858
Mr. Godfrey, it's incredibly generous,

22:17.870 --> 22:19.859
but why would you give us

22:19.872 --> 22:21.457
such a large amount of money?

22:25.545 --> 22:27.398
Well, you know what they say, Janet.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.531
You know what they say!

22:29.549 --> 22:31.402
No. No. What do they say?

22:37.290 --> 22:39.851
So, we're all agreed then? Hmmm?

22:40.527 --> 22:42.414
You'll work one more night
for our humble operation?

22:42.429 --> 22:43.339
[Misty] I will!

22:43.363 --> 22:44.912
Yeah, yeah. I can. Yes. Yes.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.256
I guess so.

22:53.273 --> 22:54.890
But, what about Mort?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.296
I'll miss him so much.

23:00.247 --> 23:01.830
No, you won't!

23:03.550 --> 23:05.740
We'll put him in your
office to keep you company.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.835
Uh.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.620
And, remember, tonight is a celebration!

23:14.394 --> 23:16.282
There will be mandatory party games

23:16.296 --> 23:18.654
during your breaks.
Esther will officiate.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.233
I can't believe I'm gonna be rich.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.931
Good stuff never happens to me.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.535
Well, Godfrey's got the
dough to spread around.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.934
You know, they've been
raking it in for centuries,

23:40.953 --> 23:42.336
ever since he brought the company over

23:42.355 --> 23:43.770
from the Old Country.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.599
Which "Old Country?"

23:44.624 --> 23:45.837
Beats me.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.409
What exactly is "the business"?

23:47.427 --> 23:49.550
Global Inventory. Duh.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.641
Right.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.518
Holy crap.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.815
We're gonna hafta haul ass

23:55.835 --> 23:56.778
if we wanna get that money.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.454
How did those get here?

23:58.471 --> 23:59.819
Did I miss the delivery guy?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.457
Jesus, get over it.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.306
(quirky music)

24:14.487 --> 24:15.667
Ta da!

24:16.989 --> 24:19.011
He's in a better place now.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.907
You really believe that?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.411
NO.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.995
[Jason] I honestly don't mind
the extra workload.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.829
In fact, I relish the
challenge to take on

25:11.844 --> 25:13.429
Mort's duties as well as my own.

25:13.446 --> 25:15.569
I gotta say, I dig your
style, Mr. Godfrey.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.570
I mean, clearly Mort's
passing was a coincidence,

25:17.584 --> 25:19.404
but you brilliantly parleyed that into

25:19.419 --> 25:20.834
increased worker productivity,

25:20.853 --> 25:22.539
and I just think I could
learn a lot from you, sir.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.440
Do you know what else

25:25.458 --> 25:26.402
you could learn a lot from, Jason?

25:32.599 --> 25:34.081
Television!

25:40.907 --> 25:42.929
Television makes people

25:42.942 --> 25:44.762
shut up and stop thinking.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.866
Oh, gee. Sir, for me,
thanks. That's, um...

25:47.880 --> 25:49.667
Television!

25:55.722 --> 25:57.170

26:15.575 --> 26:17.564

The Ambergris Islands await you.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.797
[Male Radio Announcer] So
what are you waiting for?

26:19.812 --> 26:21.126
[Woman Radio Announcer]
So what are you waiting for?

26:21.147 --> 26:23.404
I don't have to wait no more

26:31.658 --> 26:33.478
Gee, Janet, why don't you have a seat?

26:33.493 --> 26:35.583
Thank you, Misty. I
knew I could talk to you.

26:40.533 --> 26:42.522
So, what do you think is happening here?

26:43.670 --> 26:45.118
Uh, I'm working one more night.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.497
For a million bucks. That's what.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.560
But do you really believe Mr. Godfrey

26:51.578 --> 26:53.701
is going to give us
each a million dollars?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.666
[Misty] I saw Mort's
cheque. I counted the zeros.

26:56.916 --> 26:57.894
But Mort is...

26:57.917 --> 27:00.546
Don't be an idiot, Janet.

27:00.553 --> 27:01.497
But it...

27:01.521 --> 27:02.127
Get out!

27:02.154 --> 27:04.008
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.840
[TV Show host] We're
down to the final two

27:11.631 --> 27:14.530
Partner ChiChi the spider
monkey are raring to...

27:20.607 --> 27:21.853
[News Anchor] We interrupt this program

27:21.874 --> 27:23.593
to bring you breaking news.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.067
A massive earthquake has hit Australia.

27:26.579 --> 27:28.163
The death toll is unknown,

27:28.180 --> 27:30.034
but seismologists say it may be

27:30.049 --> 27:31.869
a disaster of epic proportions.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.570
Australia?

27:33.586 --> 27:34.698
[News Anchor] Measurements as high as

27:34.721 --> 27:36.608
9.7 on the Richter scale

27:36.623 --> 27:39.116
rate this as the most
devastating earthquake

27:39.125 --> 27:40.844
in recorded history.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.724
Sorry, I've got a Update, here.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.258
This is amazing. Um, remarkably,

27:49.268 --> 27:52.671
there are no reports of mass fatalities

27:52.672 --> 27:54.661
as would be expected in seismic events

27:54.674 --> 27:56.291
of this magnitude.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.803
Only. Only one person

27:58.811 --> 28:00.800
has been reported dead.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.736
We await further details
on this breaking story.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.064
And will continue to update you

28:05.084 --> 28:07.038
every hour on the hour.

28:10.557 --> 28:11.264
Mr. Godfrey!

28:11.290 --> 28:12.706
Janet.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.227
Mr. Godfrey. Um, I've
been rethinking my decision.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.956
As generous as your offer is,

28:22.969 --> 28:25.092
I just can't leave my
Nana alone overnight.

28:25.672 --> 28:26.986
I feel wracked with guilt.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.996
Aw. Poor Janet.

28:30.577 --> 28:32.059
You miss your Nana?

28:32.679 --> 28:33.656
Yeah.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.061
Seriously?

28:36.348 --> 28:38.742
Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Tons.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.006
I just can't wait to get back to her

28:41.020 --> 28:43.581
cheery little grimace and, um,

28:43.590 --> 28:45.814
well, also, Mort is dead in my office,

28:45.825 --> 28:47.981
and he's developing an odor,

28:47.994 --> 28:49.106
which makes it very hard to work and...

28:49.128 --> 28:50.880
Fascinating as always, Janet.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.657
But what I'm really wondering is,

28:53.666 --> 28:56.834
would you rather I did this,

29:05.144 --> 29:07.335
or gave you a million dollars?

29:10.049 --> 29:12.678
You're not sure? Hmm.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.306
I'll take the money!

29:21.828 --> 29:23.276
Good girl.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.952
Have some more gum.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.317
Chew, chew, chew!

29:50.122 --> 29:51.673
[News anchor] The
minuscule death toll amidst

29:51.691 --> 29:53.882
such epic scale destruction is

29:53.893 --> 29:54.836
nothing short of miraculous.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.040
Oh! I'm sorry, Mr. Godfrey.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.241
[News anchor] Says Australian Red Crest

29:57.263 --> 29:59.656
emergency management
leader Barbara Borkner.

29:59.666 --> 30:02.361
[Godfrey] Jason, perhaps the television

30:02.368 --> 30:04.356
is too much of a distraction.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.858
No! Sir, no. It's just...

30:08.407 --> 30:10.126
It's the weirdest coincidence.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.063
I was, uh, I spilled some cards,

30:12.078 --> 30:14.066
and one of them just got damaged,

30:14.080 --> 30:16.034
and it happened to be

30:16.048 --> 30:17.362
from Australia, and now...

30:17.383 --> 30:18.731
[News anchor] Australians are mourning

30:18.751 --> 30:21.379
Brisbane beekeeper Myron Bumbersnatch,

30:21.387 --> 30:23.915
the sole fatality in this
devastating earthquake.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.705
See, that's the thing.

30:25.725 --> 30:27.309
One fatality, one punchcard.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.709
[News anchor] Dedicated to his work,

30:28.728 --> 30:30.075
and to his bees.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.050
He is survived by his
wife and two children

30:32.064 --> 30:34.120
from previous relationships.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.054
As tragic as the circumstances.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.382
He annoys me.

30:37.403 --> 30:41.072
This man who speaks.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.219
Who? Peter Beckwith?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.386
Oh, I can just...

30:43.409 --> 30:44.588
Yeah, I'll just change the channel.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.891
I can just turn it off. You
know, you're totally right.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.394
No. It's important

30:47.413 --> 30:49.873
to remain apprised of current events.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.972
[News anchor] The utterly
devastating wreckage

30:51.984 --> 30:54.883
has prompted other nations to support

30:54.887 --> 30:56.201
a newly-created disaster relief.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.772
Peter Beckwith.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.239
[News anchor] There are no estimates yet

30:59.258 --> 31:01.247
as to the total financial impact.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.889
We now turn our attention to

31:03.896 --> 31:05.076
a natural phenomenon

31:05.097 --> 31:07.254
we can all get behind, adorable kittens.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.067
That's adorable!

31:20.079 --> 31:21.461
Ol' Petey's got a lot of fight in him.

31:28.788 --> 31:29.933
You see?

31:30.156 --> 31:32.447
Television, it teaches us

31:32.458 --> 31:34.278
so much about the world!

31:35.061 --> 31:36.274
Yeah.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.816
Misty Kerkovitsky.

31:43.836 --> 31:44.881
[Janet] You're going too fast!

31:44.904 --> 31:46.150
Problem, Janet?

31:46.172 --> 31:47.014
[Janet] The files are piling up.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.454
Can you slow down a bit?

31:48.474 --> 31:49.822
Uh, if I slow down,

31:49.842 --> 31:51.325
we're not gonna get this done in time,

31:51.343 --> 31:52.523
so you're just gonna
hafta kick it up a notch.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.196
[Janet] I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

31:54.213 --> 31:56.066
I shouldn't even be here.
I can't handle this!

31:56.082 --> 31:58.238
Do not ruin this for
the rest of us, Janet.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.531
[Janet] It's just, I've told you

31:59.551 --> 32:00.967
how demanding Nana can be,

32:00.987 --> 32:02.301
especially during psoriasis season.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.906
There are so many itchy areas

32:03.923 --> 32:05.270
she can't reach on her own.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.379
(buzzing)

32:10.229 --> 32:12.016
Did you just hang up on me?

32:12.031 --> 32:13.244
You mean like this?

32:15.234 --> 32:16.885
I'm just not accustomed to this pace,

32:16.903 --> 32:18.520
and I'm afraid I might make mistakes.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.368
Alternatively, perhaps I
could come back tomorrow,

32:21.373 --> 32:23.395
no charge, of course,

32:23.409 --> 32:25.060
and just finish up what
I didn't get to today.

32:25.077 --> 32:29.054
Dawn is the deadline, Janet. Dawn.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.426
Okay.

32:30.983 --> 32:34.084
What you need is an assistant!

32:41.160 --> 32:45.272
Dormant. Post-dormant.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.058
Gorg?

32:58.410 --> 33:01.107
And a fine "gorg" to you too, Mort!

33:04.116 --> 33:05.262
As you know, Mort has always possessed

33:05.284 --> 33:07.104
the physical fortitude of a donkey.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.545
He now has the mind of one, too.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.375
He can take on any size workload.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.390
No doubt, he'll be a great help to you.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.276
Now get back to work.

33:19.565 --> 33:20.981
You're welcome.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.890
Mort?

33:35.982 --> 33:37.397
You're alive?

33:51.964 --> 33:55.233
Okay. So, um,

33:56.635 --> 33:59.231
the South American cards need checking,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.194
and those boxes.

34:04.143 --> 34:07.411
Mort. Mort, my eyes are up here.

34:08.679 --> 34:09.995
That's it.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.983
You have

34:16.455 --> 34:19.152
beautiful eyes.

34:20.192 --> 34:23.326
Oh, thank you.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.149
Anyway, we really have
to get to work, because...

34:27.166 --> 34:30.400
Beautiful eyes.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.324
If you can, if you can get those cards.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.359
EYES!

34:39.678 --> 34:41.531
(bell ringing)

34:44.516 --> 34:46.370
It's break time.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.471
Mandatory party games.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.608
That way.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.959
[Mort] Duck! Duck!

35:05.071 --> 35:06.587
Duck! Duck! Duck!

35:06.605 --> 35:09.100
That is not how the game is played!

35:13.579 --> 35:16.376
Maybe that earthquake
was just a coincidence.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.438
Yeah, right. And Mort
was just "napping."

35:19.451 --> 35:21.440
Yeah, Oooh, look at you.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.408
Sarcasm, I like it.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.029
Really?

35:24.056 --> 35:25.269
Yeah.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.739
I think I might try to be
more sarcastic in the future.

35:26.758 --> 35:27.365
You should.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.303
Would you guys shut up?

35:28.327 --> 35:29.608
I'm trying to plan
the holiday I'm taking

35:29.628 --> 35:30.942
with that severance check.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.117
Misty, don't you think that there's

35:33.132 --> 35:34.547
something strange going on here?

35:34.566 --> 35:36.757
No. Everything seems perfectly normal.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.285
Except Mort smells worse than usual,

35:38.304 --> 35:40.157
and tomorrow we're all gonna be rich.

36:05.131 --> 36:06.579
[Mort] Chicken duck!

36:08.634 --> 36:10.016
Ah!

36:10.269 --> 36:11.583
(bell ringing)

36:13.705 --> 36:15.525
It is time to resume working.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.470
Okay, probably wasn't a coincidence.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.000
Yeah, I don't think so.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.776
[Radio reporter] A
freak tsunami has struck

36:36.795 --> 36:38.648
the Caribbean, causing mass devastation

36:38.664 --> 36:40.618
to Jamaica and Trinidad.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.385
The Ambergris Isles have been

36:42.401 --> 36:44.491
swallowed by the sea,
utterly obliterated.

36:45.471 --> 36:47.728
All of its citizens are dead.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.442
Folks, the Ambergris
Islands no longer await you.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.347
Meet me in the broom closet.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.810
I was wondering when I'd get my turn.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.447
Shut up.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.692
[Janet] I'm sorry, I just feel slightly

37:18.704 --> 37:20.524
uncomfortable with this arrangement.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.327
I honestly don't see the problem.

37:26.512 --> 37:29.376
Um, well, it's just that
I feel, just a little,

37:31.217 --> 37:34.317
well, uneasy working with Mort

37:34.520 --> 37:37.485
now that he's a zombie.

37:46.232 --> 37:48.523
Good, good Mort, bravo! Oh, that's rich.

37:50.236 --> 37:52.325
[Esther] Yes, this is Esther.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.494
Esther, you're gonna love this.

37:55.174 --> 37:58.105
Janet thinks Mort is a zombie!

38:04.550 --> 38:07.448
Well, if he's not a zombie,
then what is he?

38:12.591 --> 38:14.444
He is,

38:16.262 --> 38:17.845
eight-seven-three-decimal-nine...

38:17.863 --> 38:20.222
...four-space-eight-hyphen-aught-n...

38:20.232 --> 38:23.299
...space-six-dash-four-four-twospa.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.468
Status, post-dormant.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.131
Now get back to work.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.378
[Janet] Aah! No
thank you, Morty.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.341
Thank you. You can eat
it, you can eat it.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.779
Psst. Meet me in the broom closet.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.817
Oh! Uh, well, I'm flattered,

38:50.829 --> 38:52.851
but I don't think that you and I...

38:53.799 --> 38:55.518
Well, it's just that I'm not a...

38:55.534 --> 38:56.512
Oh, God! Why does everyone here act

38:56.535 --> 38:58.489
like I'm some kind of
slutty slut whorebag?

39:00.539 --> 39:01.719
Ho-bag.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.358
Just come!

39:04.610 --> 39:06.295
Okay.

39:11.217 --> 39:12.531
[Misty] I sent up seven cases

39:12.551 --> 39:13.428
from the Caribbean
Islands half an hour ago.

39:13.452 --> 39:16.283
And now there are no Caribbean Islands.

39:16.288 --> 39:17.198
[Jason] And when Godfrey decided

39:17.223 --> 39:18.436
he didn't like that news anchor,

39:18.457 --> 39:20.345
he was dead, within seconds.

39:20.359 --> 39:22.853
The Australian earthquake,
the Caribbean Islands.

39:24.296 --> 39:25.509
It's like Godfrey's summoning

39:25.531 --> 39:27.250
the end of the the world.

39:27.266 --> 39:29.356
[Misty] And even if
Godfrey keeps his word,

39:29.368 --> 39:30.952
and lets us go free after
giving us the money,

39:30.969 --> 39:32.655
what the hell are we gonna spend it on?

39:32.671 --> 39:33.816
I've seen the movies.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.457
No one shops after the apocalypse.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.997
I am never gonna get to
go to an all-inclusive,

39:39.010 --> 39:40.864
and drink my face off!

39:43.014 --> 39:44.397
We have to tell someone,

39:44.416 --> 39:45.932
we have to tell them
what's going on here.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.299
God, yeah, right!

39:47.319 --> 39:48.701
Try to leave and you'll
end up like Mort.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.664
Balloon!

39:49.688 --> 39:50.530
Ew!

39:50.922 --> 39:52.406
Icky, nasty! Bad!

39:57.896 --> 39:59.850
We have to call 911.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.247
[Jason] Uh, hello,

40:01.267 --> 40:02.614
how long have you been working here?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.454
There's no cell reception
in this building.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.221
And the business
phones were disconnected.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.457
Except for Esther's.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.862
[Janet] Right. Right!

40:12.611 --> 40:14.701
Okay, okay, so,

40:14.713 --> 40:16.970
What if I sneak into her office

40:16.982 --> 40:18.600
and call 911?

40:18.617 --> 40:19.931
What can I do?

40:19.951 --> 40:21.401
You and Mort, you guys,

40:21.420 --> 40:23.273
you watch Godfrey,

40:23.289 --> 40:24.704
you keep him off the third floor.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.273
[Jason] No problem, he loves me.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.004
Misty, do you think you could

40:29.027 --> 40:30.948
distract Esther while I go in?

40:32.030 --> 40:33.413
Sure.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.013
Is that okay?

40:35.033 --> 40:37.392
That hag comes at me
and I'll rip her tits off.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.453
But if I'm gonna do this,

40:39.471 --> 40:40.415
you have to promise me one thing.

40:40.439 --> 40:42.292
Because I don't want Godfrey

40:42.308 --> 40:43.756
bringing me back like he did Mort.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.362
Mort.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.682
Ugh. God, you gotta burn me up,

40:54.686 --> 40:56.372
or chop me up,

40:56.388 --> 40:58.680
or dissolve me in a vat of battery acid.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.443
Where would I find
a vat of battery acid?

41:00.459 --> 41:01.975
Wherever, just be creative.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.847
Just please, please promise me.

41:03.862 --> 41:04.840
Okay, well, what size chunks

41:04.863 --> 41:05.672
do I have to chop you into?

41:05.697 --> 41:06.607
Jason!

41:06.632 --> 41:07.306
Okay, I promise!

41:11.370 --> 41:12.987
All right! Let's do this.

41:18.344 --> 41:19.489
- [Mort] Mort.
- [All] Aaahhh!

41:23.982 --> 41:25.567
Esther?

41:26.785 --> 41:28.537
Why have you abandoned
your work station?

41:28.854 --> 41:29.932
[Misty] Oh, is this the
portion of the evening

41:29.955 --> 41:31.674
allotted for work?

41:31.690 --> 41:32.936
I thought this was the
portion of the evening

41:32.958 --> 41:34.778
allotted for "Misty/Esther Girl Time!"

41:36.695 --> 41:38.851
There is no portion of
the evening allotted for...

41:38.864 --> 41:40.077
Oh, but you're wrong.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.643
Haven't you seen the schedule

41:41.667 --> 41:43.352
posted down by the elevator?

41:44.403 --> 41:46.425
I did not authorize any such posting.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.726
Well, it's posted there.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.428
Come see.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.407
(quirky music)

42:14.733 --> 42:16.687
I see no such posting.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.058
You see no such posting!

42:24.142 --> 42:26.096
(Misty laughing)

42:27.145 --> 42:29.403
This portion of the evening

42:29.415 --> 42:31.672
has not been allotted for laughter.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.973
You know why you see no such posting?

42:33.985 --> 42:35.704
Because this is the portion

42:35.721 --> 42:37.945
of the evening allotted for lying.

42:38.123 --> 42:39.539
That is not true.

42:39.558 --> 42:41.142
Exactly! Because this is the portion

42:41.159 --> 42:43.687
of the evening allotted for lying.

42:43.695 --> 42:44.807
That is not true.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.144
This is the portion of the evening

42:46.164 --> 42:48.591
allotted for fucking with Esther's mind!

42:49.167 --> 42:51.662
THAT IS NOT TRUE!

42:52.738 --> 42:54.490
[911 Operator] 911.
Where are you phoning from?

42:54.506 --> 42:56.596

[911 Operator] Gopher
Globule who, ma'am?

43:02.981 --> 43:04.566
You are afraid.

43:06.852 --> 43:08.672
Actually, I'm not.

43:09.955 --> 43:12.111
Watch this.
(Spits)

43:13.459 --> 43:16.188
[Esther] That is a direct
violation of company policy!

43:22.133 --> 43:24.088
It is on now, bitch!

43:24.603 --> 43:27.770
No, no, Godfrey Global Inventory!

43:28.840 --> 43:30.829
[911 Operator] There's
no Groggy Gogo Factory

43:30.842 --> 43:32.561
listed in our records.

43:40.185 --> 43:43.083
So it's Godfrey Global Inventory?

43:43.088 --> 43:44.975
Yes! Now I don't have much time,

43:44.990 --> 43:46.843

43:46.858 --> 43:48.981
[911 Operator]
Shhhh! What was that?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.477
What was that?

43:51.763 --> 43:52.976
Hello?

43:55.701 --> 43:56.846
[911 Operator] Did
you hear that, Elliott?

43:56.868 --> 43:58.081
It came from outside.

43:58.604 --> 44:00.254
I must be hearing things.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.024
Sorry, ma'am, what were you saying?

44:03.542 --> 44:05.192
My name is Janet Crimple.

44:05.210 --> 44:06.525
The world is going to end tonight

44:06.545 --> 44:08.230

44:08.246 --> 44:09.629

44:09.648 --> 44:11.569
There it is again. Hear that?

44:16.087 --> 44:18.750

Elliot? Did you see that?

44:19.758 --> 44:21.545
Jesus God! They're coming
through the window!

44:21.560 --> 44:23.008
What, exactly, is
coming through the window?

44:23.028 --> 44:24.881
[911 Operator] I've never
seen so many raccoons!

44:24.896 --> 44:26.885
AAAAAAAAAAH!

44:40.546 --> 44:42.297
[911 Recording] Your

44:42.313 --> 44:43.257
Please wait for the
next available operator.

44:43.281 --> 44:45.000
No, no, no.

44:53.324 --> 44:55.178
[Esther] I shall file an incident report

44:55.193 --> 44:57.587
with Mr. Godfrey immediately.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.123
[Jason] Oh my God.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.767

45:31.096 --> 45:32.781

45:35.901 --> 45:37.788
[Jason] Janet? Are you okay?

45:40.939 --> 45:42.658
You made a promise.

45:54.185 --> 45:56.073
Esther did this? How?

45:56.087 --> 45:57.031
She's like a million years old!

45:57.055 --> 45:58.571
I know.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.910
[Jason] Oh my god! Misty!

46:02.260 --> 46:04.619
[Janet] Jason, there's no time to mourn.

46:05.196 --> 46:06.983
You know what you have to do.

46:09.735 --> 46:12.026
No, I, No, I can't!

46:12.037 --> 46:13.250
This is Misty! No, she wants me to.

46:13.271 --> 46:15.326
I know, I know, but you promised!

46:17.308 --> 46:18.691
You have to.

46:20.378 --> 46:22.367
Okay, okay! Okay, how?

46:22.948 --> 46:24.734
I don't know. I don't know,

46:24.750 --> 46:25.895
but we have to get her out of here

46:25.917 --> 46:27.198
before Godfrey finds her.

46:27.218 --> 46:28.364
Okay.

46:29.287 --> 46:30.736
Okay, let's just pull her up.

46:30.756 --> 46:31.868
Okay.

46:35.694 --> 46:36.672
How do we do this?

46:36.695 --> 46:37.369
I don't know.

I'm sorry for all those times

48:05.917 --> 48:07.366
I was a dick to you.

48:09.354 --> 48:12.353
I promise, if I get out of this alive,

48:12.357 --> 48:14.244
I'm not gonna live like that anymore.

48:16.161 --> 48:18.891
See? Now there's a second
thing I promised you.

48:25.003 --> 48:27.328
I don't know if I can do this, Steve!

48:29.340 --> 48:30.722
Okay.

48:31.977 --> 48:33.728
Gotta summon the strength.

48:34.846 --> 48:36.801
Gotta breathe that

48:36.815 --> 48:39.274

No way, Jack. Biohazard.

49:29.868 --> 49:31.316
Please!

49:37.042 --> 49:38.356
I know this smell.

49:40.912 --> 49:42.496
Rotting corpse.

49:44.015 --> 49:45.296
That's just Mort.

Please wait for the

50:01.099 --> 50:02.279
next available operator.

50:08.239 --> 50:10.093
We invented that, you know.

50:16.247 --> 50:17.933
Who is we?

50:19.484 --> 50:21.001
[Jason] It's not just the one incident.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.041
The Australian beekeeper,

50:23.054 --> 50:24.335
and Mort's heart attack,

50:24.355 --> 50:25.434
and then Janet nearly

50:25.456 --> 50:27.142
chokes to death on her own gum.

50:27.158 --> 50:29.248
[Oola] You get million dollars

Look, you're missing the point, okay?

50:33.631 --> 50:35.653
The world is ending, all right?

Look! Just look!

50:40.071 --> 50:41.183
[Oola] Soccer game. So?

50:41.206 --> 50:42.856

50:45.043 --> 50:47.098
and he's turning blue!

50:48.113 --> 50:50.944
The stadium has erupted in violence!

50:51.249 --> 50:52.495
The fans are killing each other!

50:52.517 --> 50:54.404
Oh my God. They're killing each other!

50:54.419 --> 50:56.373

The beautiful game get ugly some time.

50:59.991 --> 51:01.373
Oh, the beautiful...

51:01.392 --> 51:02.639
You need to help us get
a message to the police!

51:05.530 --> 51:08.058
I not your little
message slave, white boy.

51:09.300 --> 51:10.682
You on salary. You go.

51:10.701 --> 51:12.185
I can't leave the building, okay?

51:12.203 --> 51:13.450
Godfrey has my punchcard,

51:13.471 --> 51:16.370
and if he processes it, I am gonna die.

51:19.277 --> 51:21.064
Good thing this place go tits up.

51:22.380 --> 51:24.099

51:54.212 --> 51:56.032
I have some very exciting news,

51:56.047 --> 51:58.440
so I need you all to be very quiet,

51:58.449 --> 52:00.977
or I will kill you!

52:00.986 --> 52:02.670
It seems that Misty

52:02.687 --> 52:05.215
has opted for early retirement,

52:05.756 --> 52:07.981
so the rest of you
must pick up the slack.

52:09.394 --> 52:11.113
I'm counting on my dependable employees

52:11.129 --> 52:13.252
to muster up that

52:13.264 --> 52:15.455
good ol' Godfrey Global spirit

52:15.466 --> 52:18.634
to get the job finished by the deadline!

52:19.737 --> 52:21.691
And if we refuse?

52:23.241 --> 52:25.094
That's all right.

52:25.110 --> 52:27.367
Mort here refused, and
he's still working!

52:28.079 --> 52:31.449
Sort of. Aren't ya
there, big guy? Please.

52:34.385 --> 52:36.576
A post-dormant worker is
better than no worker at all.

52:41.159 --> 52:43.080
Hey, Mr. Godfrey, I hear

52:43.094 --> 52:45.621
you are short-handed.

52:47.432 --> 52:49.487
[Godfrey] Yes, as a
matter of fact, we are.

52:50.335 --> 52:52.289
I can help you.

52:52.303 --> 52:54.022
Why, that would be marvelous.

52:54.372 --> 52:56.528
For million dollars.

52:58.109 --> 53:01.344
Deal or no deal?

53:03.348 --> 53:05.302
Welcome aboard.

53:08.253 --> 53:09.297
As a matter of fact,

53:09.320 --> 53:11.275
I've already taken the liberty

53:12.223 --> 53:14.178
of pulling your punchcard.

53:16.694 --> 53:19.593
Oola. As you were.

53:21.099 --> 53:22.514
(bell ringing)

53:28.506 --> 53:30.460
It's time to resume working.

53:46.124 --> 53:47.405
What are you doing?

53:47.658 --> 53:50.355
You think I stupid? I got plan.

53:51.362 --> 53:53.351
This girl look out for number one.

54:05.476 --> 54:07.296
[Jason] Oola says that she's got a plan.

54:07.778 --> 54:09.363
We should make a plan.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.334
I know, but what can we do?

54:13.884 --> 54:17.120
I mean, if we leave, he'll
just punch our cards.

54:17.755 --> 54:18.834
If we slow down.

54:18.856 --> 54:20.204
[Janet] He'll punch our cards.

54:20.225 --> 54:21.404
[Jason] And if we refuse to work.

54:21.426 --> 54:22.235
[Janet] He'll just punch our cards,

54:22.260 --> 54:24.249
and turn us into whatever Mort is.

54:26.831 --> 54:28.516
Who are you guys?

54:32.703 --> 54:34.826
We're waiting on you, Janet.

54:35.906 --> 54:37.390
Go! Go!

54:39.244 --> 54:41.299
Coming right up, Mr. Godfrey.

54:45.683 --> 54:48.615
(quirky music)

55:08.606 --> 55:11.336
So, uh, what's your plan?

55:12.643 --> 55:14.329
[Oola] Get my punchcard.

55:14.345 --> 55:15.491
[Jason] How?

55:18.516 --> 55:19.762
Take it.

55:21.952 --> 55:23.671
Take it?

55:24.789 --> 55:26.878
You seriously think
it's gonna be that easy?

55:26.891 --> 55:28.206
[Oola] Yup.

55:28.226 --> 55:29.270
You know, I used to be as smug

55:29.294 --> 55:31.215
and as self-centred as you.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.515
[Oola] Your boyfriend cute!

55:33.531 --> 55:35.217
[Jason] What?

55:36.301 --> 55:38.356
No, no, that is not my boyfriend!

55:38.369 --> 55:40.223
Okay, there isn't a boyfriend,

55:40.238 --> 55:41.822
I don't have a boyfriend.
How'd you do that?

55:45.910 --> 55:47.629
You're a pickpocket!

55:49.314 --> 55:51.639
In my country, I stole to survive.

55:52.483 --> 55:55.348
In this country, I take
my punchcard. I survive.

55:55.353 --> 55:56.230
Yeah, what about the rest of us?

55:56.254 --> 55:57.535
Can you help me and Janet?

55:57.555 --> 55:59.509
Can't save anyone if I
die. First save myself.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.544
Please, please, please, please, please.

56:01.559 --> 56:03.715
I don't wanna die!
Please, I don't wanna die,

56:03.728 --> 56:05.750
I just, I don't wanna be here.

56:06.497 --> 56:07.845
Okay.

56:10.235 --> 56:11.549
Okay, maybe if you nice,

56:11.569 --> 56:13.725
I save you and sad old Janet, too.

56:13.738 --> 56:14.883
Okay.

56:14.905 --> 56:16.254
I just charmed Oola

56:16.274 --> 56:16.812
into stealing our punchcards back.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.425
Great!

56:18.443 --> 56:19.420
[Jason] Yeah, that chick is so into me.

56:19.444 --> 56:21.769
You know, maybe
Godfrey's not gonna do it.

56:22.547 --> 56:23.827
Maybe he's just gonna give us

56:23.848 --> 56:25.600
a million dollars and let us live.

56:27.385 --> 56:28.699
No. Think.

56:29.687 --> 56:32.720
Janet, he never said
he would let us live.

56:32.723 --> 56:34.341
He said he'd give us a million dollars.

56:34.359 --> 56:36.280
He never said he'd let us live.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.755
Is there a problem here?

56:43.768 --> 56:45.689
No, no problem at all, sir.

56:45.870 --> 56:48.263
Do you know where's
there's really no problem?

56:49.674 --> 56:52.841
Downstairs.
"Post-Dormant Morty."

56:53.844 --> 56:55.530
He's the ideal employee.

56:57.815 --> 56:59.501
Perhaps I should...

56:59.517 --> 57:01.471
[Janet] No, no, no. No.

57:01.486 --> 57:02.934
We've got it under control, Mr. Godfrey!

57:03.521 --> 57:04.499
Cart's coming in now.

57:06.857 --> 57:08.408
Excellent.

57:16.967 --> 57:18.619
Go, go, go.

57:23.508 --> 57:24.822
[TV Show host #1]
ChiChi the spider monkey

57:24.842 --> 57:26.897
is ripping out Nestor Crepe's lung.

57:27.512 --> 57:29.601
She's throwing it at the judges!

58:53.063 --> 58:56.602
[Godfrey] What, may
I ask, are you doing?

59:02.807 --> 59:04.660
Tickle-tickle?

59:15.586 --> 59:17.911
[Jason] Mort! Help.
Down here. Mort.

59:18.155 --> 59:20.986
Mort. There we go.
There we go. Down.

59:20.991 --> 59:22.002
- [Mort] Down.
- [Jason] Down.

59:22.026 --> 59:23.475
[Mort] Down.

59:23.494 --> 59:24.909
- [Jason] Here, okay?
- [Mort] Down.

59:24.929 --> 59:26.074
- [Jason] Here we go.
- [Mort] Down.

59:26.096 --> 59:29.534
[Jason] Yes, hold,
hold and up. There.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.427
(quirky music)

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.553
[Jason] So, you didn't
get our punchcards.

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:38.882
And here I thought that you were some

01:00:38.903 --> 01:00:40.824
big, hot shot pickpocket.

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:42.625
Oh, Godfrey not human.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.892
He demon!

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.197
With eyes in the back of hand!

01:00:49.013 --> 01:00:51.574
Lucky for me, demon
like "tickle-tickle."

01:00:51.582 --> 01:00:53.571
Do you really think
that Godfrey's a demon?

01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:54.831
Shhhh!

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:59.549
Like, an entry-level minion demon,

01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:03.149
or a chief executive demon?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.587
Are you all cozy in there?

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:50.530
[Jason] All hail the dark lord!

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.906
All hail the dark lord!

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:57.632
Beg pardon?

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:00.833
I'm sorry. I was...

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.638
I was assuming that
that was the correct.

01:02:02.653 --> 01:02:04.237
Anyhow, I have a hunch

01:02:05.656 --> 01:02:08.588
that you have some big
plans for the future,

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:12.261
Mr. Godfrey, and I want in.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:14.741
Really?

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:16.147
Yes.

01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:19.257
Big, dark,

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.326
evil plans.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.927
Really?

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:28.334
Yeah. And I've goosed my résumé

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:30.097
to accentuate some of my more, oh,

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:33.237
diabolical characteristics.

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:40.018
You sang in a Presbyterian boys' choir?

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.211
Yeah, but read below that.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:44.281
I lip synced the whole time.

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:46.249
I never actually sang a note.

01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:48.145
Take that, God!

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.213
God!

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.054
And I've worshipped graven images.

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:54.124
I worshipped the Miss October centrefold

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:56.901
so hard that it got moldy.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:01.291
You are telling me this why?

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:03.367
[Jason] Because I
want in, Mr. Godfrey,

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.739
on the whole anti-Christ action.

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.805
Look, I even got a tattoo!

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.667
"999?"

01:03:09.687 --> 01:03:10.867
No, six, oh!

01:03:13.057 --> 01:03:14.809
That's magic marker.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.072
[Jason] Yeah, but I'm
totally gonna get it inked

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:17.273
once I cash my severance check.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:20.092
Which I hope isn't even

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.310
a severance check at all,

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.623
because I wanna keep serving you, sir.

01:03:24.735 --> 01:03:26.858
Whatever you may need,

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:29.327
I am so down for it.

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:34.327
Hmmm.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.834
Whatever I need?

01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:43.387
Whatever you, uh, you need.

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:56.110
Where have you been?

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:57.819
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.062
What time is it?

01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:13.440
It's 5:06. We're running out of time.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.310
- 5:13!
- What is it?

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:19.906
[Janet]
5:13, it's the question and answer

01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:21.271
portion of the evening!

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.821
The question and
answer period has begun.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.110
Is Nana still alive?

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:28.108
[Godfrey] Your Nana died peacefully

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:29.918
in her sleep several hours ago.

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:31.246
No!

01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:35.890
What about the rest of us?

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.254
[Godfrey] Now, now, Janet.

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:39.162
It's our turn to ask you questions.

01:04:39.844 --> 01:04:41.427
This is so exciting.

01:04:43.781 --> 01:04:45.163
The question is,

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:47.466
now that you're not shackled

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.843
to that cruel, rotting, parasite.

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:52.335
Why are you crying, Janet?

01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:55.976
Parasite?

01:04:57.828 --> 01:04:59.850
Don't you talk about my Nana like that!

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.256
With the shrewd eye of a slave trader,

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:06.290
"Nana" plucked you from the foster home

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.055
at the age of six,

01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:10.228
enlisting you into a
life of dismal servitude

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.397
in her cold and loveless home.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.368
A life laden with
constant reminders to...

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.869
Oh.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:22.430
(in Nana's voice)
Thank your lucky stars

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.340
I took you in, Janet,

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:27.387
'cause your crackhead
Mama sure didn't want you!

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.214
If I hadn't of saved you,

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:31.845
you'd be paddling bare-handed

01:05:31.862 --> 01:05:34.389
up a creek full of shit, Janet!

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:38.028
Janet! Where's my ointment?

01:05:38.202 --> 01:05:40.089
Yeah, Janet,

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:42.227
WHERE'S MY OINTMENT?

01:05:42.807 --> 01:05:44.289
STOP!

01:05:51.816 --> 01:05:53.500
Nana may have loved her ointment,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.369
but she was a really

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:04.278
kind of a

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.786
vicious, vicious woman!

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:13.784
Wow.

01:06:19.944 --> 01:06:21.258
Is it my turn to ask a question?

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:22.322
Yes.

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:24.300
And that was it.

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:26.464
But, I...

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.494
The question and answer period is over.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:29.531
But what about the rest of us?

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.305
Back to work now, Janet.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.414
[Janet] Will you let me live?

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.418
Do you really think
you deserve to, Janet?

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:43.992
Because I'm beginning to wonder myself.

01:06:53.377 --> 01:06:55.331
[Janet] "Do you really
think you deserve to, Janet?"

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.266
Of course I deserve to live.

01:07:04.188 --> 01:07:05.401
I think.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.338
I do.

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:13.313
I think I know I do.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:15.845
Oh!

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:19.854
But Nana's dead, and...

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:26.462
Nana's dead.

01:07:29.313 --> 01:07:32.312
And my life can finally begin.

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:37.113
I deserve to live. So
do you. So does Oola.

01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:37.930
Says Godfrey?

01:07:37.955 --> 01:07:38.629
Says me.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.273
Oh.

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:42.001
[Janet] We'll ambush Godfrey and Esther

01:07:42.026 --> 01:07:43.104
when we're all together.

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:44.947
Whoa! Whoa. Ambush.

01:07:44.962 --> 01:07:45.500
[Janet] Yeah.

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:46.978
Yeah. What if, uh...

01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:48.210
There's no "what if" scenario worse than

01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:49.512
what happens if we don't
try to save ourselves.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.558
Oh, come on, Jason, work with me!

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.424
You're supposed to be
smart. Come up with a plan.

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.565
You're right, I am the
smartest person here.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:03.047
And actionization strategies
are my thing. Yaahr.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.927
Oh god, we're doomed.

01:08:04.949 --> 01:08:05.622
What's that?

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:07.233
Nothing.

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.168
"Dawn is the deadline."

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:10.669
That's what Godfrey said.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.406
What time does the sun rise?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.411
(quirky music)

01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:20.170
(bell ringing)

01:10:23.287 --> 01:10:25.376
[Esther] It is time to stop working.

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:29.321
It is also time to collect
your severance bonuses.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.647
Stop by the office.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.220
This is Esther speaking.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.831
[Janet] So, this is it.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.469
What's the plan?

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.104
[Jason]
I'm glad you asked that, Janet,

01:10:58.122 --> 01:11:00.312
because actionization,

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:02.144
it's more about finesse
than brute force.

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.574
All right. And?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.189
[Jason]
And I'm gonna go in there and, uh.

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:08.678
And I'm gonna distract Godfrey

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.417
with a bit of my trademark
scintillating wit.

01:11:10.434 --> 01:11:11.849
And then Janet, you're
gonna flirt with Esther.

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:12.778
What?

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:13.914
Yeah, don't worry,
you're totally her type.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.723
Just flash her a little
elbow skin. She likes that.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:17.188
What? Ewww!

01:11:17.207 --> 01:11:18.454
And then while they're distracted,

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:20.396
Oola, you're gonna go in
Godfrey's jacket pocket,

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:23.265
and then just yoink.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:23.886
"Yoink?"

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:25.262
Yeah.

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:26.225
That's your plan? "Yoink?"

01:11:28.252 --> 01:11:29.667
Oola already tried
picking Godfrey's pocket,

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:31.304
it didn't work.

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.141
Oh! Well, what's your
brilliant plan, Janet?

01:11:33.157 --> 01:11:34.403
Yeah, yeah, I'd love to hear

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:35.671
what the old maid has to say.

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:37.310
Too bad Nana isn't here
to give you some advice!

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:44.421
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:46.816
I promised I wouldn't be such a dick,

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.398
but my dickishness,
it's just so it's just,

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:51.663
it's really entrenched
in my personality.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:56.564
If only my mentor was here.

01:11:58.248 --> 01:12:01.685
Steve! Why have you forsaken me!

01:12:02.186 --> 01:12:04.376
"Steve!" "Warrior fire."

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:06.373
You're familiar with
Shaman Steve's teachings?

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:08.479
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I've seen the infomercials.

01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:09.604
[Jason] And?

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:12.525
And it's total horseshit, Jason! Yaahr!

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:13.807
[Mort] Yaahr!

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.481
Come on!

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.461
You're right. I know you're right.

01:12:19.203 --> 01:12:20.315
What did that skeevy

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:22.291
pony-tailed bastard ever do for me?

01:12:22.306 --> 01:12:25.204
[Oola] Oh, blah blah blah.
You guys talk too much.

01:12:25.209 --> 01:12:26.893
No, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.494
You just get in there.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:32.507
And you get your punchcard back.

01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:33.628
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:36.380
Great plan. Jackass.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.811
[Oola]
You stay here. Sit down.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.520
Please. Stay.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.513
Sit.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:58.538
Mort lover. Not fighter.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.434
[Godfrey] Congratulations.

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:09.410
You have succeeded in processing

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.576
every last punchcard

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:13.913
on the face of the planet.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:17.456
Except, of course, for these
last remaining three.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:24.460
And the ones that Janet stole.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:29.375
[Godfrey]
Yes, and the ones that Janet stole.

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:32.526
You'll return them now, Janet.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:36.530
No, I won't.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.366
Yes, you will.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:42.287
Otherwise, I shall simply have to

01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:47.397
kill, eeny meeny miny.

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:50.040
Jason!

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:51.745
No! No, no, Janet, you can't
let him do this. Please.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:52.974
[Godfrey] Whaddya say, Janet?

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.986
You wanna watch Jason die?

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.430
Oh! Take it. Take it all.

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:14.478
Excellent. Now, thanks to you,

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:19.359
all the good work at
Godfrey Global Inventory is done!

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.449
As is the entire human race.

01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:34.827
And here is to a contract completed,

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:36.321
and a job well done!

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:37.485
(applause)

01:14:42.379 --> 01:14:45.985
And now, I have some
envelopes to distribute!

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:51.883
The first, for Janet.

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:54.044
Our dear Janet.

01:14:54.057 --> 01:14:56.888
Janet! For your craven loyalty

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:59.421
to a thankless system of
soul crushing monotony,

01:14:59.429 --> 01:15:02.865
and for your unwavering

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:05.764
failure to show the slightest backbone

01:15:05.769 --> 01:15:09.105
even in the face of extreme evil.

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:13.370
Your dogged servitude has been essential

01:15:13.377 --> 01:15:15.769
to the success of Godfrey Global.

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:17.464
AAAAAAH!

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:19.364
Oola, catch!

01:15:20.417 --> 01:15:22.472
(struggle)

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:46.044
[Godfrey]
I do not understand you people!

01:15:47.511 --> 01:15:48.993
Instead of going to your graves with

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:51.674
an extremely generous severance package,

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:54.714
instead, you shall all be terminated

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:59.061
without pay for this act
of insubordination.

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:02.382
You are all now officially

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.513
[Both] FIRED!

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:10.890
And that's what we're all about.

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:53.122
You did it.

01:16:54.544 --> 01:16:56.431
You saved us all.

01:16:58.915 --> 01:17:00.566
I didn't save us all.

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:03.739
I saved us three.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.447
Out of how many billions?

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.544
Still.

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:16.213
High five, dude.

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:23.870
I still breathing.
He still breathing.

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:27.730
You still breathing.

01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:32.240
Three's a lot better than fuck all.

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:36.871
You strong lady.

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:39.211
You gotta be strong lady

01:17:39.589 --> 01:17:41.847
in this world to survive.

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:48.018
What world?
