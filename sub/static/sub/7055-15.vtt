00:09.114 --> 00:12.300
I need you
to do something for me.

00:12.856 --> 00:14.941
Walter.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.601
How can she have memories
of my Olivia's life

00:17.668 --> 00:19.019
that are clearer to her
than her own?

00:19.104 --> 00:21.055
No matter how badly
I want my Olivia back,

00:21.139 --> 00:23.524
I can't make this one have
memories she didn't experience.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.642
I think you are.
Even without meaning to.

00:25.694 --> 00:26.944
And it's wrong, Peter.

00:27.011 --> 00:28.862
I don't understand
what's happening to me,

00:28.947 --> 00:31.115
but if you look into my eyes,
you can see that I am her.

00:31.182 --> 00:32.849
No.
I know she's out there--

00:32.901 --> 00:35.953
my Olivia in my timeline.
I'm sorry.

00:36.020 --> 00:38.906
I think it's better
if I just stay away.

The whole world is on fire,

01:14.993 --> 01:17.394
We've had to completely
reevaluate

01:17.445 --> 01:18.779
all our security
measures

01:18.863 --> 01:22.399
after what that woman did.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.234
The truth is...

01:24.285 --> 01:26.503
I wanted to give you time
to collect your thoughts.

01:26.571 --> 01:29.706
I know when there's something
you want to talk about.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.564
I'm in love with Peter.

01:37.632 --> 01:40.750
I know it sounds absurd
to you.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.519
I hardly know him.

01:42.587 --> 01:46.523
But it's like I've known him
my entire life.

01:46.591 --> 01:47.858
And everybody,
including him,

01:47.925 --> 01:50.894
keeps telling me
that it's impossible.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.780
When Walter told me
what you were going through--

01:52.864 --> 01:55.599
two sets of memories,
two sets of experiences--

01:55.650 --> 01:58.769
he said the Cortexiphan dosing
might be enabling you

01:58.837 --> 02:01.221
to remember things that
Peter wants you to remember.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.907
But I can remember things
that Peter couldn't have known,

02:03.958 --> 02:06.443
like details of cases
that he wasn't on

02:06.494 --> 02:10.881
or names, um,
places he's never been.

02:10.948 --> 02:15.219
I mean, how can that be
if--if he's controlling it?

02:15.286 --> 02:17.954
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>this is happening,</i>

02:18.006 --> 02:21.725

I'm scared.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.765
We're gonna figure out what's
happening with you, Olive.

02:28.817 --> 02:31.985
Now, as for your feelings
about Peter,

02:32.070 --> 02:34.271
all wounds heal
over time.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.774
Yeah. I just wish the time
would move a little quicker.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.076
Well, that's a coincidence,

02:39.143 --> 02:42.913
because we just filed a patent
on that last week.

02:42.980 --> 02:46.316
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.

02:48.453 --> 02:50.838
What's wrong?

- Is everything all right?

happened here

07:45.713 --> 07:46.880

pick up, Walter?

07:46.965 --> 07:48.215

That's severe bruising.
Those aren't bruises.

08:47.775 --> 08:49.743
The victim's skin had
a reaction to some type

08:49.827 --> 08:51.778
of chemical residue left
by the assailant's hands.

08:51.863 --> 08:53.396
So why are we here?

08:53.448 --> 08:55.098
<i>This is the second killing</i>
<i>in a month</i>

08:55.166 --> 08:56.366
<i>where a woman has had</i>
<i>the same marks.</i>

08:56.417 --> 08:58.368
<i>Both were recently widowed.</i>

08:58.419 --> 09:00.904
And the husbands died
under mysterious circumstances.

09:00.955 --> 09:03.040
<i>The bodies were dumped</i>
<i>in fields,</i>

09:03.091 --> 09:04.124
completely dehydrated.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.676
As a matter of fact,
Ms. Hall had just

09:05.743 --> 09:07.261
arrived home from her
husband Mark's funeral

09:07.345 --> 09:08.462
when she was killed.

09:08.546 --> 09:11.247
Okay, so we know
that the killer

09:11.299 --> 09:12.248
is targeting couples.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.084
<i>There's one more thing.</i>

09:14.135 --> 09:17.471
In both cases, DNA of
the deceased husbands

09:17.555 --> 09:18.939
was found
on the victims' necks.

09:19.023 --> 09:21.558
You're saying that
both widows were killed

09:21.609 --> 09:22.943
by their dead mates?

09:23.027 --> 09:24.895
It appears that's what
the evidence is saying.

09:24.946 --> 09:27.547
But her husband's body
was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.

09:55.292 --> 09:57.311
Oh, my.

09:57.395 --> 10:00.147
Hello?

10:00.231 --> 10:02.683
Peter, I need you here
immediately--where are you?

10:02.767 --> 10:06.269
I'm in a cab on my way
to the bus station.

10:06.321 --> 10:08.905
Bus station?
Where are you going?

10:08.973 --> 10:10.140
<i>New York.</i>

10:10.191 --> 10:13.493
You wanted me to stay away
from her, remember?

10:13.578 --> 10:16.079
<i>And a bus is as good a mode</i>
<i>of transportation as any</i>

10:16.147 --> 10:18.248
<i>when you're trying</i>
<i>to get out of town.</i>

10:18.315 --> 10:20.334
You didn't tell me.

10:20.418 --> 10:24.371
<i>Anyway, you must come back</i>
<i>to the lab at once.</i>

10:24.455 --> 10:26.006
Why, what's going on?

10:26.090 --> 10:30.210
I think the observer may have
done something to your eye.

10:50.815 --> 10:54.067
Whatever he did, it wasn't seen
by the other observers.

10:54.152 --> 10:58.155
All I care about is
what he's done to you.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.795
So what's in New York?

11:04.862 --> 11:08.181
I told you, Walter,
it's what's not in New York--

11:08.249 --> 11:11.251
Olivia.

11:21.378 --> 11:23.546
I admire you, Peter.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.934
And why is that, Walter?

11:28.019 --> 11:32.222
I told you what the right thing,
ethically, was to do...

11:32.273 --> 11:34.741
leaving Olivia...

11:36.694 --> 11:38.945
But I don't know that
I would have had the strength

11:39.030 --> 11:40.280
to do it myself.

11:40.364 --> 11:43.166
Is that your way
of thanking me

11:43.234 --> 11:44.618
for taking your advice?

11:44.702 --> 11:47.037
It's a...

11:47.088 --> 11:50.624
particularly obtuse way
to admit

11:50.708 --> 11:52.843
that you're a better man
than I am.

12:01.052 --> 12:04.771
<i>Einai kalytero anthropo</i>
<i>apo ton patera toy.</i>

12:04.856 --> 12:07.441
Is that Greek?

12:07.525 --> 12:09.443
Yeah.

12:09.527 --> 12:11.761
Yeah, it means be a better man
than your father.

12:11.813 --> 12:15.265
It's something I was told
a long time ago.

12:15.316 --> 12:18.101
But it is very strange
to hear you say it.

12:29.580 --> 12:30.497
Hmm.

12:30.581 --> 12:32.666
What is it?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.885
There's something in there.

12:41.926 --> 12:44.845
It's got writing on it.

12:53.754 --> 12:54.800
<i>It's an address.</i>

12:54.801 --> 12:57.518
<i>228 1/2 Morrow Street.</i>
<i>It's amazing.</i>

12:58.098 --> 13:00.766
I suspect this message,

13:00.833 --> 13:02.518
if left alone
to run its course,

13:02.602 --> 13:04.336
would have fully dissolved,

13:04.387 --> 13:07.389
taking its place
firmly in your mind's eye.

13:07.474 --> 13:10.643
You think this would have
etched itself into my brain?

13:10.694 --> 13:12.844
<i>Organic ocular suggestion.</i>

13:12.896 --> 13:15.013
You wouldn't be aware,

13:15.065 --> 13:17.015
but you would be irresistibly
compelled to visit.

13:17.067 --> 13:20.069
<i>Dr. Bishop?</i>

13:20.153 --> 13:21.537
What?

13:21.621 --> 13:23.872
Agent Farnsworth said to bring
her in if we were here first.

13:23.957 --> 13:26.575
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.694
I think
it's a case, Walter.

13:28.745 --> 13:30.713
Oh. Oh, oh, right.

13:30.797 --> 13:32.197
Well, fine.

13:32.249 --> 13:35.384
Bring the poor dear down
and put her on the slab.

14:10.537 --> 14:13.956
The human body is composed
of 60% water.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.543
However, Mr. Hall's body was
drained of almost all moisture.

14:17.594 --> 14:21.246
He was literally killed
by extreme dehydration.

14:21.298 --> 14:24.383
Among other things
that are lost with such...

14:24.434 --> 14:28.053
dehydration...

14:28.104 --> 14:30.356
are pheromones.

14:30.423 --> 14:34.109
It wasn't only Mr. hall's DNA
found on his widow's neck.

14:34.194 --> 14:37.429
Specifically, it was
a very concentrated solution

14:37.480 --> 14:41.650
of Mark's pheromones,
which is what's causing

14:41.735 --> 14:43.819
the burning
on the victim's neck.

14:43.903 --> 14:45.788
Why would somebody
concentrate pheromones?

14:45.872 --> 14:48.657
They control our moods,
our appetites...

14:48.742 --> 14:52.494
Who we give our hearts to.

14:52.579 --> 14:56.665
So he's targeting couples,

14:56.750 --> 14:58.834
killing the male,
extracting the pheromones.

14:58.918 --> 15:01.670
Do you think that
he's trying to win the female?

15:01.755 --> 15:04.390
A love potion?

15:04.457 --> 15:06.291
Possibly.

15:08.228 --> 15:09.511
Mm...

15:09.596 --> 15:10.763
I would like to examine

15:10.814 --> 15:12.431
the first victims
he did this to.

15:12.482 --> 15:16.185
Okay. I will get the ball
rolling on the exhumations,

15:16.269 --> 15:18.270
see if I can get
their files pulled.

15:18.321 --> 15:21.106
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.

15:21.157 --> 15:25.744
I made him get off
the bus to New York.

15:25.812 --> 15:28.614
But you didn't know that.

15:28.665 --> 15:31.250
That he was on his way
to New York?

15:31.317 --> 15:35.120
No.

15:35.171 --> 15:36.922
<i>Where is he now?</i>

17:16.973 --> 17:19.023
<i>Thank you, dear.</i>

17:29.402 --> 17:32.504
Walter, my memories
are slipping.

17:32.572 --> 17:34.156
They're disappearing.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.242
Your own memories?

17:37.293 --> 17:39.745
You said to me they're
in the back of your mind.

17:39.796 --> 17:41.380
Well, I didn't tell anybody
that it was happening,

17:41.447 --> 17:43.114
because if Peter
was gonna be with me,

17:43.166 --> 17:45.050
then I didn't think
about the consequences.

17:45.117 --> 17:47.503
I just didn't care.

17:49.672 --> 17:51.507
But it's getting
worse, Walter,

17:51.591 --> 17:53.592
whatever it is
that's happening.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.227
And I want you to try
and stop it.

17:55.294 --> 17:57.145
I want you to see
if you can reverse it.

17:57.230 --> 17:59.464
I just--I want to go back
to who I was.

18:10.026 --> 18:11.994
Olivia...

18:14.197 --> 18:17.833
I don't want to feel
like this anymore.

18:19.836 --> 18:22.153
I'll think of something.

19:03.546 --> 19:05.363
<i>I can do that,</i>
<i>if you want.</i>

19:05.415 --> 19:06.415
Really?

19:06.499 --> 19:08.133
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah, that'd be great.</i>

19:08.200 --> 19:11.219
Thank you.
Oh, he's so cute.

19:11.304 --> 19:16.308
I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.559
Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.

19:17.644 --> 19:21.513
Oh, you two look
so in love.

19:21.564 --> 19:22.714
Beautiful.

19:22.765 --> 19:26.384
- Oh, it's great.
- Perfect.

19:26.436 --> 19:27.385
You guys from around here?

19:27.437 --> 19:28.386
Yeah, Brooklyn.

19:28.438 --> 19:30.439
Come on, Oliver.

19:32.692 --> 19:34.893
All right.

19:38.197 --> 19:39.948
- Well, take care.
<i>-  Thank you.</i>

19:40.033 --> 19:41.500
Thanks.

19:56.599 --> 19:59.885
Andrew, be sure to get
the lake in the background.

20:03.756 --> 20:07.526
I could take that picture
for you, if you want.

20:11.412 --> 20:13.380
Smell this.

20:18.579 --> 20:20.831
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid!

20:20.915 --> 20:24.167
<i>Mortius bestia--</i>
roadkill.

20:24.252 --> 20:26.653
Specifically,
an aromatic excretion

20:26.721 --> 20:29.039
from the castor sacs
of the North American beaver

20:29.123 --> 20:31.708
used primarily
for marking and mating.

20:31.793 --> 20:34.528
I went beaver hunting
in eastern Canada

20:34.595 --> 20:35.796
in the '70s.

20:35.847 --> 20:37.514
Of course, in those days,

20:37.598 --> 20:40.333
"beaver" meant
something else entirely.

20:40.385 --> 20:42.602
Walter, why would you
make me wear this

20:42.670 --> 20:43.720
and smell roadkill?

20:43.805 --> 20:45.639
Because I have been
smelling things

20:45.690 --> 20:46.807
for the past hour,

20:46.858 --> 20:48.141
and I've lost
my objectivity.

20:48.192 --> 20:50.610
Now are you gonna help me
or not?

20:56.150 --> 20:58.652
Okay, take a look
at these.

20:58.703 --> 21:01.038
These are statements
from friends and family.

21:01.122 --> 21:04.241
The one thing that they said
about both couples

21:04.325 --> 21:07.077
is that they had great,
solid, loving marriages.

21:07.161 --> 21:08.578
So?

21:08.663 --> 21:10.747
So maybe he's targing
couples that personify

21:10.832 --> 21:12.916
the kind of love
that he wants.

21:18.172 --> 21:22.009
What?

21:22.060 --> 21:23.810
Nothing.

21:35.323 --> 21:38.191
Are you okay?

21:38.242 --> 21:40.060
I mean, with all
you've been through

21:40.111 --> 21:41.294
in the past few days...

21:41.362 --> 21:44.581
You know, if you ever...

21:44.665 --> 21:48.168
need anything...

21:48.235 --> 21:50.837
I'm here.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.510
I know.

22:09.524 --> 22:12.059
Um, Walter wants to know
which of you has

22:12.110 --> 22:14.094
fearless nasal passages.

22:14.145 --> 22:18.482
For thousands of years,
perfume makers have used

22:18.566 --> 22:21.618
a single disparate,
rancid note

22:21.702 --> 22:24.121
to counterbalance
all of the other sweet

22:24.205 --> 22:26.373
and unctuous scents
in a fragrance.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.109
The ancient Mesopotamians
used fish oil.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.128
The Greeks used
animal carcass.

22:31.212 --> 22:33.997
The Egyptians used
afterbirth.

22:34.082 --> 22:37.250
But used in proportion
so that the human nose

22:37.301 --> 22:38.885
cannot detect
the unique odor.

22:40.297 --> 22:42.309
You're saying our suspect is
making a perfume?

22:42.528 --> 22:43.912
No. But like perfume,

22:43.996 --> 22:47.165
the chemical compound
that our perpetrator is using

22:47.216 --> 22:50.034
to lure the opposite sex...

22:50.085 --> 22:54.422
Does contain a rancid note.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.392
I found this
on Jane Hall's neck,

22:57.476 --> 23:00.311
mixed with the pheromones
of her dead mate.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.046
It's an ingredient
called castoreum.

23:02.097 --> 23:05.016
- Hmm?
-  Uh-uh.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.935
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>we can trace it.</i>

23:07.019 --> 23:08.403
It is not easy to get.

23:08.487 --> 23:11.239
I only found five perfume
manufacturers that use it.

23:11.323 --> 23:15.443
You guys can work these,
and I'll take these.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.904
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey. Where are you?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.323
We're just leaving Scentax.
We're on our way to KJS next.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.324
Forget about that place.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.976

Last time I spoke to Andrew
was this morning.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.418
His car's
in the shop today.

29:15.485 --> 29:19.122
I told him to get a ride
home from work because...

29:19.173 --> 29:23.009
Because I was too busy.

29:23.093 --> 29:26.796
Believe me when I tell you
that we are going to make sure

29:26.847 --> 29:29.932
that he doesn't hurt you
or anybody else.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.935
We're in position.

29:41.645 --> 29:44.313
Now what?

29:46.867 --> 29:49.452
Now we wait.

29:54.324 --> 29:58.010
Just keep looking
straight ahead.

30:03.167 --> 30:05.635
You must have loved
each other very much.

30:08.856 --> 30:12.708
We were married the summer
after our senior year at Brown.

30:17.231 --> 30:19.098
This August, it...

30:19.183 --> 30:22.018
would have been 15 years.

30:29.443 --> 30:32.278
We were best friends
in college.

30:35.165 --> 30:38.434
He was always helping me
get over a broken heart

30:38.502 --> 30:44.373
from one boy or another.

30:44.441 --> 30:45.908
<i>He couldn't understand</i>

30:45.976 --> 30:48.811

30:48.879 --> 30:53.516
<i>What I was looking for.</i>

30:53.584 --> 30:55.417
<i>He couldn't really understand</i>
<i>the difference</i>

30:55.469 --> 30:58.254

30:58.322 --> 31:02.108

31:02.192 --> 31:04.660
<i>It's different, you know.</i>

31:07.397 --> 31:11.150
But people get tired...

31:13.436 --> 31:17.340
of looking and hoping.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.136
Maybe he's taking his time.

31:47.187 --> 31:48.654
Like he did with Jane Hall.

31:48.739 --> 31:51.023
Or maybe he was never
coming here at all.

31:51.108 --> 31:53.326
This guy targets
couples in love.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.278
You heard her talking
about her marriage.

31:55.329 --> 31:57.330
Why would Carr pick them?

32:04.955 --> 32:07.123
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible
that your husband

32:07.174 --> 32:08.791
may have been having
an affair?

32:13.380 --> 32:16.682
How did you know?

32:16.767 --> 32:18.500
Do you know her name?

32:47.247 --> 32:49.215
W-what are you doing
in my house?

33:00.594 --> 33:03.813
Shh...
No!

33:03.880 --> 33:07.233
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

33:44.721 --> 33:46.422
No, please, God!

33:46.473 --> 33:47.523
No! Help me!
Shh.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.608
Help me!
Shh, shh.

33:55.532 --> 33:58.617
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

33:58.702 --> 34:01.954
I'm so sorry.
Aah!

34:08.295 --> 34:11.246
<i>Let her go!</i>

34:11.297 --> 34:14.632
<i>Move away from her.</i>

34:47.764 --> 34:51.132
Do you know how much pain
you caused?

34:55.688 --> 34:59.442
I don't want you to think
that I did it for me.

35:01.745 --> 35:05.114
I mean,
not just for me.

35:07.117 --> 35:11.287
We're not meant
to be alone.

35:11.338 --> 35:16.876
It's every human being's right
to know love.

35:20.997 --> 35:24.166
And had I succeeded...

35:24.218 --> 35:27.169
Had I found

35:27.221 --> 35:31.841
the right chemicals--
just the right...

35:31.892 --> 35:33.893
balance...

35:37.948 --> 35:42.652
I could have given
the world...

35:42.703 --> 35:45.020
what you have.

35:46.573 --> 35:50.326
What do I have?

35:50.377 --> 35:53.129
Love.

35:53.196 --> 35:57.800
I can smell
that you're in love.

36:12.733 --> 36:15.234
I was wondering
when I'd hear from you.

36:15.319 --> 36:17.069
I was just making some tea.

36:17.154 --> 36:20.356
How are you feeling?
I'm okay.

36:20.407 --> 36:22.775
I talked to Walter.

36:22.860 --> 36:25.394
What did he say?

36:28.031 --> 36:30.032
It doesn't matter.

36:33.003 --> 36:35.788
I met a woman today.

36:35.873 --> 36:37.757
She'd just lost
her husband,

36:37.841 --> 36:41.010
and as she was talking
about him

36:41.077 --> 36:43.596
and her marriage,

36:43.680 --> 36:47.200
as much as she wanted to be,
she--she wasn't in love.

36:47.267 --> 36:50.419
As I was listening
to her...

36:53.256 --> 36:56.692
I realized
what she was saying.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.028
She had let go

36:59.095 --> 37:01.614
of the possibility
of love...

37:01.698 --> 37:04.200
of finding love.

37:04.268 --> 37:08.237
And I could see
myself in her.

37:08.305 --> 37:11.340
I didn't like who I was.

37:11.408 --> 37:14.377
Now, all of these...

37:14.444 --> 37:18.297
memories and feelings
that I'm experiencing,

37:18.382 --> 37:21.968
they're from
a--a better version of me.

37:22.052 --> 37:26.389
I've decided to let things
run their course.

37:26.456 --> 37:28.508
Oh, you had
an emotional day,

37:28.592 --> 37:30.760
and you don't have to decide
anything right now.

37:30.811 --> 37:33.596
I've made my decision.

37:36.934 --> 37:40.036
You have so much
in your life, Olive.

37:40.103 --> 37:42.822
Are you just gonna let that
all disappear?

37:42.906 --> 37:45.024
And be replaced by what?

37:45.108 --> 37:49.212
Memories...of a life
that you didn't live?

37:53.417 --> 37:55.818
Yes.

38:04.661 --> 38:08.464
Well, how long
do we have?

38:08.515 --> 38:11.601
I don't know.

38:11.668 --> 38:12.969
Neither does Walter.

38:13.020 --> 38:16.188
Hmm.

38:18.692 --> 38:20.476
Well, my mother
used to say,

38:20.527 --> 38:24.513
"Encourage the quest
for happiness in your children,

38:24.565 --> 38:29.018
even if it takes them
very far away from you."

38:36.159 --> 38:39.579
When the day comes...

38:39.663 --> 38:43.198
if I don't remember this...

38:43.250 --> 38:47.753
I want you to try and
build something with me again.

38:47.838 --> 38:49.939
Don't give up on me.

38:54.728 --> 38:56.512
I love you, Nina.

38:59.232 --> 39:02.018
I love you, Olive.

39:47.764 --> 39:49.982
Thank you.

39:50.067 --> 39:53.069
For what?

39:55.472 --> 39:59.642
They hid the universe
from me.

39:59.710 --> 40:01.210
They locked me out.

40:01.278 --> 40:04.146
- You mean the other observers.
- Yes.

40:06.583 --> 40:11.837
What I led you to
is a beacon.

40:11.922 --> 40:14.757
I needed you
to activate it

40:14.825 --> 40:17.460
so I could find
my way back.

40:20.430 --> 40:22.932
So I helped you.

40:26.937 --> 40:29.271
Then I need you
to help me now.

40:29.322 --> 40:32.474
I have tried everything
that I can think of...

40:32.526 --> 40:36.028
everything that I know
how to do to get back home,

40:36.113 --> 40:37.663
and none of it
has worked.

40:37.748 --> 40:39.882
And nobody here
can help me.

40:39.950 --> 40:43.819
But you can.
I know you can.

40:46.823 --> 40:48.624
Please...

40:50.727 --> 40:52.828
help me get back home.

40:55.966 --> 40:58.634
You have been home
all along.

41:02.472 --> 41:04.640
I don't understand.

41:07.144 --> 41:10.446
I was erased.

41:10.514 --> 41:14.016
There is no scientific
explanation.

41:14.084 --> 41:16.185
But...

41:16.253 --> 41:19.221
I have a theory

41:19.289 --> 41:23.692
based on a uniquely
human principle.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.695
I believe you could
not be fully erased

41:26.763 --> 41:29.031
because the people

41:29.099 --> 41:31.700
who care about you

41:31.752 --> 41:34.487
would not let you go.

41:34.554 --> 41:36.872
And you...

41:36.940 --> 41:40.876
would not let them go.

41:44.181 --> 41:48.400
I believe
you call it "love."

41:52.823 --> 41:55.224
And Olivia?

41:59.562 --> 42:02.397
She is your Olivia.
