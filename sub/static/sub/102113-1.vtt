12:48.041 --> 12:50.916
just because they demonstrate
a little Black pride.

12:53.250 --> 12:57.750
But just so you know,
you are a poet.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.041
[Fred]<i> Somebody</i>
<i>define war for me.</i>

13:04.708 --> 13:09.000
War is a violent conflict
between two or more parties.

13:09.083 --> 13:13.041
[Fred] Would you say we at war
with the pigs, Comrade Palmer?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.875
Chairman, I'd take it
a step further and say

13:14.958 --> 13:16.333
that every ghetto
across the nation

13:16.416 --> 13:17.958
should be considered
occupied territory.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.083
Right on.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.916
Well, how about politics?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.458
How would you define politics,
Brother Winters?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.541
Uh...

13:26.625 --> 13:28.708
[hesitates]
You know, elections.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.125
[Fred] Elections can be part
of politics, certainly.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.583
But we in the party

13:32.666 --> 13:34.333
ascribe to Chairman Mao's
definition of politics.

13:34.416 --> 13:38.458
He said, "War is politics
with bloodshed,

13:38.541 --> 13:40.916
and politics is war
without bloodshed."

13:41.666 --> 13:43.000
Say it with me, y'all.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.166
[students] "War is politics
with bloodshed.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.125
Politics is war
without bloodshed."

13:47.208 --> 13:49.708
[Fred] Now, what that mean?

13:49.791 --> 13:52.458
It mean every time
the pigs shoot down

13:52.541 --> 13:54.541
an unarmed brother
or sister in the street,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.875
Mayor Daley pulled the trigger.

13:56.958 --> 13:58.916
It mean Tricky Dicky Nixon

13:59.000 --> 14:01.625
is the fattest,
most filthy pig in the pen.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.333
[students chuckle]

14:04.666 --> 14:07.083
So, how we win this war?

14:07.166 --> 14:09.416
What's our most lethal weapon?

14:09.500 --> 14:13.041
Guns? Grenades?

14:13.125 --> 14:15.166
Rocket launchers?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.375
These niggas
got rocket launchers?

14:17.458 --> 14:20.083
[chalk scribbling]

14:26.708 --> 14:28.666
[Fred] There's strength
in numbers.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.041
Power anywhere there's people.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.916
And in order to
overthrow this racist,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.416
fascist, nefarious
U.S. government,
it's gonna take everybody.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.625
[Fred] Black Panther paper!
Free your mind
for just a quarter.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.041
Sorry, I'm on my way to work.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.333
Well, I'm at work, sister.
I work for you.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.208
Information is raw material
for new ideas.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.291
Oh, you got kids?

14:48.375 --> 14:50.083
-Your friends got kids?
-Yeah.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.000
Well, we got
a breakfast program
feedin' 300 kids a week.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.125
[Fred]<i> Because we've grown</i>
<i>so accustomed to being poor,</i>

14:54.208 --> 14:56.458
<i>we think it's normal</i>
<i>for our kids</i>
<i>to go to school hungry.</i>

14:56.541 --> 14:59.291
<i>We think it's normal for us</i>
<i>to go to the hospital</i>
<i>with a runny nose</i>

14:59.375 --> 15:01.125
<i>and come home in a body bag.</i>

15:01.208 --> 15:04.875
So, our job
as the Black Panther Party

15:04.958 --> 15:06.625
is to heighten
the contradictions.

15:06.708 --> 15:07.875
[Fred] I pledge allegiance...

15:07.958 --> 15:09.125
[children]
I pledge allegiance...

15:09.208 --> 15:10.333
[Fred] ...to my Black people.

15:10.416 --> 15:11.833
[children]
...to my Black people.

15:11.916 --> 15:13.208
I pledge to develop...

15:13.291 --> 15:15.208
[children]
I pledge to develop...

15:15.291 --> 15:17.083
[Fred]<i> ...my mind and body</i>
<i>to the greatest</i>
<i>extent possible.</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:20.666
...my mind and body
to the greatest
extent possible.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.166
I will learn all that I can...

15:22.250 --> 15:24.333
[children] I will learn
all that I can...

15:24.416 --> 15:26.666
...in order to give
my best to my people
in the struggle for liberation.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.041
[children] ...in order to give
my best to my people

15:29.125 --> 15:30.916
in the struggle for liberation.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.833
So, the people can decide
if they wanna overthrow
the government

15:34.916 --> 15:36.125
or not.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.208
[indistinct chatter]

15:39.291 --> 15:41.208
These two people
are waiting to see you
from VISTA.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.250
Also, Brother Cohran called.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.333
He wanted to know
if you willing to speak
at a fundraiser at the theater,

15:45.416 --> 15:47.666
and somebody named
Stanley Uhuru

15:47.750 --> 15:49.875
said he wanted to speak to you
about a credit union.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.291
What's that?

15:52.375 --> 15:54.125
EKG machine.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.250
For the clinic,
when we get it up and running.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.500
[Fred] Mm-hmm.

16:04.375 --> 16:08.958
The poet.
What a pleasant surprise.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.750
I saw your ad in the paper
lookin' for a new speechwriter.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.541
I figured I'd better
come lend a hand.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.458
Well, that must have
been a misprint.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.208
See, I don't write speeches,
sister.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.375
I just get up on stage
and speak truth
to the people.

16:19.458 --> 16:23.541
Oh, it shows.
The lack of preparation,
that is.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.875
It got you here.

16:25.958 --> 16:31.208
[Betty]<i> "We want land, bread,</i>
<i>housing, education,</i>
<i>clothing...</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:34.416
justice, and peace."

16:34.500 --> 16:37.458
[Fred]
"Housing, justice, peace."

16:37.541 --> 16:39.250
Life, liberty, happiness.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.416
I mean, it's all right there
in the Declaration
of Independence.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.916
But when poor people demand it,
it's a contradiction.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.416
It's not democracy,
it's socialism, dig?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.208
[Bill] We can
do something after this,
if you want to.

16:48.291 --> 16:49.833
O'Neal, stand up.

17:03.666 --> 17:06.416
What is the party line
in regards to our sisters,
comrade?

17:07.833 --> 17:10.291
Um... [sucks teeth]

17:12.125 --> 17:14.000
Anybody?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.041
[Doc Satchel]
"Do not take liberties
with women."

17:16.125 --> 17:17.916
Oh, come on now.
I ain't takin' no goddamn...

17:18.000 --> 17:21.416
These aren't just your sisters.
They're your sisters-in-arms.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.083
Act like it.

17:28.041 --> 17:29.500
Twenty push-ups for discipline.

17:30.166 --> 17:31.625
Captain Harmon...

17:32.875 --> 17:34.625
count 'em out.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.458
[Judy]<i> What's wrong, O'Neal?</i>

17:36.541 --> 17:38.916
Down to the ground!

17:40.458 --> 17:42.625
-[grunts]
-You scared of a little dirt?

17:42.708 --> 17:45.333
I could have a sister
put a towel down for ya.

17:45.416 --> 17:46.875
[students chuckle]

17:46.958 --> 17:49.000
[Bill] You ain't tell me
it was gonna be like this.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.541
These motherfuckers
ain't no terrorists.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.541
Shit, they terrorizing me.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.000
What can I do to help?

18:07.083 --> 18:11.750
The goal is
to get close to Hampton.
So, think.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.666
What does he need

18:13.750 --> 18:19.125
that maybe your Uncle Sam
might be able
to help you provide?

18:23.833 --> 18:25.000
A car.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.041
Fred don't drive no more.
'Cause the pigs always...

18:31.666 --> 18:34.291
Shit, the police.

18:34.375 --> 18:36.375
-No, that's good.
-[scoffs]

18:36.458 --> 18:38.500
You're becoming a Panther.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.125
The pigs are always
followin' him around,

18:41.208 --> 18:44.458
givin' him
bullshit traffic violations,
right? So,

18:44.541 --> 18:47.791
if you want me
to get close to Fred,

18:48.708 --> 18:50.208
give me a car.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.791
[funk music playing]

19:37.208 --> 19:39.333
[honks horn]

19:43.000 --> 19:45.166
[Jake] Jimmy, come on, man.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.250
[Bill] Say, Chairman,
that wasn't no goddamn pig

19:47.333 --> 19:49.041
you was eatin' out there,
was it?

19:49.125 --> 19:51.166
Somebody gotta show the pig
who's boss, man.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.500
[chuckles] All right,
y'all ready to split? Huh?

20:04.416 --> 20:06.291
Y'all got weapons?
Give 'em here.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.708
Now, Judy, you is out
of your rabbit-ass mind

20:13.791 --> 20:17.125
if you don't get
your motherfuckin' boot
off my shit.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.583
[scoffs and laughs]

20:19.666 --> 20:21.041
Shit.

20:27.041 --> 20:29.833
Yo, Winters,
how many pistols you got, man?

20:29.916 --> 20:31.208
[Fred] What about you?

20:31.291 --> 20:35.083
Mine's in the glove box.
[laughs] Motherfucker.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.833
Park as close to Leon's
as you can,

20:37.916 --> 20:40.625
in case we gotta haul ass
outta there.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.458
[Judy] Chairman,
that's the Crowns' pool hall.

20:43.541 --> 20:46.041
[Fred] Exactly. Stay sharp.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.666
Hey, Chairman,
what are we doin' here?

20:54.750 --> 20:57.333
[Fred] Getting
the Crowns' attention.

20:57.416 --> 20:59.916
[tense music playing]

21:08.333 --> 21:10.500
[bop music playing on speakers]

21:14.416 --> 21:16.000
[Fred] Evenin',
brothers and sisters.

21:16.083 --> 21:19.833
I wanted to hip y'all to a new
free breakfast program

21:19.916 --> 21:21.833
opening on the South Side
next week.

21:21.916 --> 21:23.166
Free for the babies.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.500
All you gotta do
is drop your little ones off

21:24.583 --> 21:26.916
and we'll take care
of the rest.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.458
Stop on by to Saint Andrew's
and check us out.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.750
And if you're on the West Side
or you got family
on the West Side,

21:32.833 --> 21:35.375
we at the Better Boys Club,
Monday through Friday.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.750
The Illinois
Black Panther Party
has a mandate

21:37.833 --> 21:41.375
to feed every hungry kid
in Chicago.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.166
I'm not talkin' about
handing out turkeys
on Thanksgiving,

21:43.250 --> 21:44.416
that's charity.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.416
Save that for the pushers
and the preachers

21:46.500 --> 21:49.208
who call themselves
doin' you a favor
after they done sucked you dry.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.000
Fuck charity.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.250
The Black Panther Party
believes in progression.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.333
Now, what that mean?

21:55.416 --> 21:58.083
That mean, first,
you have free breakfast,

21:58.166 --> 22:00.833
then you have free healthcare,

22:01.791 --> 22:03.708
then you have free education.

22:03.791 --> 22:06.541
Next thing you know,
you look up, you done freed
your motherfuckin' self!

22:06.625 --> 22:09.208
[Collins] Know where you at,
motherfucker?

22:12.166 --> 22:14.333
This is Crowns territory.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.583
We don't want no trouble,
brother.

22:15.666 --> 22:16.916
We just passin' through.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.458
Besides, the rap we on
is a political one.

22:19.541 --> 22:20.833
It shouldn't really
concern y'all.

22:20.916 --> 22:23.250
Nigga, don't lecture me
on politics.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.500
The Crowns protected
Martin Luther King
when he was here in 1966.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.708
[Fred] And he got
his head split open.

22:28.791 --> 22:31.000
Damn near killed
by a mob of crackers
throwin' Irish confetti.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.375
Bang-up job y'all did.

22:32.458 --> 22:33.833
[Bill] Hey, hey, hey!
Get the fuck back!

22:33.916 --> 22:36.166
Get the fuck back, nigga!
Back up!

22:36.250 --> 22:38.375
-[Fred] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[gun cocks]

22:38.458 --> 22:40.750
No need for that, brother.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.500
We on our way.

22:42.583 --> 22:47.125
But dig, I got a message
for the big man.

22:47.208 --> 22:51.083
Tell him the Panthers
wanna sit down
with the Crowns.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.833
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

23:09.041 --> 23:11.333
[Jake] You sure
you wanna go sit down
with the Crowns, Chairman?

23:11.416 --> 23:12.791
[Fred] Hell, yeah.

23:12.875 --> 23:15.541
Imagine the Panthers,
the Stones, the Crowns,

23:15.625 --> 23:19.041
and the Disciples fighting
under one revolutionary army.

23:19.125 --> 23:21.333
Them pigs ain't ready for that.

23:22.166 --> 23:23.500
Shit.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.291
[Jimmy]
I'll tell y'all one thing.

23:25.375 --> 23:28.166
I'm bringin'
my motherfuckin' pistols
to that goddamn meeting.

23:29.291 --> 23:31.625
And you hear me, Chairman?
Shit.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.375
Maybe one of yours, too, nigga.

23:33.458 --> 23:35.833
[Fred] All you need
is a pool stick,
ain't that right, O'Neal?

23:35.916 --> 23:37.458
[all laughing]

23:37.541 --> 23:41.416
You see him swinging
that thing around? [laughs]

23:41.500 --> 23:44.375
Hey, don't you
underestimate my skill,
God damn it! None of y'all!

23:44.458 --> 23:45.458
You got heart, Bill.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.750
You wild, but you got heart.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.000
Wild Bill.

23:50.083 --> 23:53.375
Wild Bill! Wow! Wild Bill!

23:53.458 --> 23:56.083
Man, tell me
they ain't call you that
in Maywood!

23:56.166 --> 23:58.833
[chuckles] Nah, man,
they ain't call me nothing.

23:58.916 --> 24:00.125
[Fred] Nah?

24:00.208 --> 24:01.500
Shit, I mighta heard it
once or twice.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.458
See, I knew it! I knew it!
Wild Bill!

24:03.541 --> 24:05.041
-[Jake] Yeah!
-[Judy laughs]

24:05.125 --> 24:07.041
God damn it, Harmon,
you and these goddamn cognomen.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.625
-[Fred] Oh, man...
-[Jake] Wild Bill!

24:08.708 --> 24:11.041
Pool stick to a gun fight, man.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.500
[laughter]

24:12.583 --> 24:15.083
[door unlocking, closes]

24:16.625 --> 24:18.250
[key clatters]

24:23.291 --> 24:24.916
[Bill] Wild Bill. [chuckles]

24:36.875 --> 24:39.666
[Roy] Come on in,
make yourself at home
in the den.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.541
This is Samantha.

24:46.458 --> 24:49.708
[interviewer]
<i>What made you think</i>
<i>you could trust Roy Mitchell?</i>

24:51.291 --> 24:53.375
Uh, I'd rode around
in his car.

24:53.458 --> 24:56.541
I had dinner with him
at his dinner table.

24:56.625 --> 25:02.083
Um... You know, he was,
at one point, for me,
he was like a role model.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.750
When I didn't have one,
you know?

25:03.833 --> 25:06.291
We had very few role models
back then.

25:06.375 --> 25:10.833
We had Martin Luther King,
Malcolm X,

25:10.916 --> 25:12.541
Muhammad Ali.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.458
<i>I had an FBI agent.</i>

25:18.500 --> 25:22.083
You know, I investigated
the Schwerner,
Chaney, Goodman murders

25:22.166 --> 25:25.750
down in Mississippi in '64.

25:25.833 --> 25:27.166
You familiar?

25:29.666 --> 25:30.666
Well...

25:31.541 --> 25:33.291
A couple kids was trying

25:33.375 --> 25:36.500
to register Negroes to vote.
That's all they were doing.

25:36.583 --> 25:40.666
They got arrested
on bogus speeding charges

25:40.750 --> 25:42.541
by the sheriff's deputy,

25:42.625 --> 25:45.125
who hand-delivered them
to the Klan.

25:47.583 --> 25:50.625
And they shot 'em, of course.

25:51.916 --> 25:53.875
Cut off Chaney's penis.

25:53.958 --> 25:55.291
[chuckles softly]

25:57.041 --> 25:58.833
This,

25:58.916 --> 26:00.791
what you and I are doing, is...

26:00.875 --> 26:01.791
What?

26:01.875 --> 26:04.375
Is the other side of that coin.

26:04.458 --> 26:05.791
[Bill grunts softly]

26:09.166 --> 26:12.791
Don't let Hampton fool you.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.958
The Panthers and the Klan
are one and the same.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.625
Their aim is to sow hatred

26:19.708 --> 26:21.958
and inspire terror.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.458
Plain and simple.

26:26.250 --> 26:29.000
Now, I'm all for civil rights,

26:29.083 --> 26:33.208
but you can't cheat your way
to equality.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.750
And you certainly
can't shoot your way to it.

26:37.416 --> 26:38.500
Yep.

26:47.625 --> 26:52.041
Anyway, I'm going to go
get those dogs going.

26:52.125 --> 26:55.500
No, no, sit down.
You're a guest.

26:55.583 --> 26:57.791
Uh, if you want a taste
of the good stuff,

26:57.875 --> 27:01.000
there's a bottle of scotch
in this bottom cabinet there.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.750
You can help yourself.

27:02.833 --> 27:05.166
Hey, how much money
you make, man?

27:09.041 --> 27:11.208
[Roy exhales]

27:11.291 --> 27:15.291
It's a... It's a living.
[chuckles]

27:15.375 --> 27:19.375
So, if I... Say, I get you,
like, some good information.

27:19.458 --> 27:20.708
Somethin' nobody else knows.

27:20.791 --> 27:22.500
Is there some kind
of bonus or somethin'?

27:22.583 --> 27:27.875
Well, I'm counting on it, Bill.

27:27.958 --> 27:32.833
But, to answer your question,
you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

27:36.708 --> 27:38.583
Make yourself at home.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.083
[footsteps receding]

27:42.166 --> 27:44.708
[Leslie]<i> Did he say</i>
<i>when this meeting's</i>
<i>taking place?</i>

27:44.791 --> 27:48.375
No, just that Hampton wants
to unify the Black gangs.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.000
You know, he'd probably help us
write the darn thing

27:52.083 --> 27:53.833
for a couple more bucks.

27:53.916 --> 27:56.666
What fun would that be?
[snickers]

27:56.750 --> 28:01.000
I'm pretty sure it's actually
just "dig," not "dig in."

28:01.083 --> 28:03.833
What the fuck do you know?

28:03.916 --> 28:08.250
I know
I've definitely heard 'em
say "dig in" before.

28:08.333 --> 28:09.958
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

28:10.041 --> 28:11.583
Use it in a sentence.

28:11.666 --> 28:13.250
[Leslie chuckles]

28:14.791 --> 28:17.958
Oh. Okay.

28:18.041 --> 28:22.333
These Crowns,
well, they ain't nothin'...

28:22.416 --> 28:27.083
[snickers]
but a bunch of jive sissies.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.708
[knocking on door]

28:32.708 --> 28:36.291
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton
of the Illinois
Black Panther Party.

28:36.375 --> 28:38.791
[dramatic percussive music
playing]

28:49.750 --> 28:50.750
[blows]

28:57.541 --> 28:58.750
[gun cocks]

29:08.041 --> 29:09.166
[chuckles lightly]

29:15.000 --> 29:17.125
[Steel] Fred Hampton,

29:18.083 --> 29:22.333
the great orator
of the West Side!

29:22.416 --> 29:23.541
[chuckles]

29:23.625 --> 29:24.875
Your name's been ringing out,
blood.

29:24.958 --> 29:26.916
It's your world, Brother Steel.

29:27.791 --> 29:29.333
Hmm.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.458
So, what can I do for you?

29:32.541 --> 29:34.833
Well, I wanna know
what we can do for each other.

29:34.916 --> 29:35.833
[scoffs]

29:35.916 --> 29:37.208
Y'all was doin' some great work

29:37.291 --> 29:39.166
mobilizing young brothers
on the South Side,

29:39.250 --> 29:41.416
and we a part of
a national organization

29:41.500 --> 29:44.041
dedicated to the liberation
for oppressed people
everywhere.

29:44.125 --> 29:47.166
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

29:47.250 --> 29:51.166
This nigga got some
million-dollar words, don't he?

29:51.250 --> 29:52.666
They wasn't lyin'.

29:52.750 --> 29:53.916
[chuckles]

29:55.083 --> 29:56.750
It's not just talk, brother.

29:56.833 --> 29:59.083
Our breakfast program feeds
over 3,000 kids a week.

29:59.166 --> 30:04.250
Motherfucker, the Crowns feed
more babies than General Mills.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.500
Now, who you think employs
all their mommies and daddies?

30:06.583 --> 30:07.791
Well, right on, brother,
right on.

30:07.875 --> 30:09.833
But question is,
can you do even more?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.083
Hmm?

30:13.166 --> 30:16.333
There's over 5,000 Crowns
in Chicago.

30:16.416 --> 30:20.791
Between your manpower
and the Panther's
political platform,

30:21.791 --> 30:23.458
we can heal this whole city.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.666
And if we take care of Chicago,

30:27.750 --> 30:28.833
shit.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.333
Come on, man.

30:33.958 --> 30:37.583
You mind
if I read you something,
Brother Hampton?

30:37.666 --> 30:39.750
Somebody dumped a whole bunch
of these pamphlets

30:39.833 --> 30:41.583
on our front yard
the other day,

30:41.666 --> 30:44.750
and I just thought
they might be
of interest to you.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.916
-Do you mind if I...
-Go ahead.

30:49.375 --> 30:51.000
"Word on the street

30:51.083 --> 30:55.375
is that the Crowns
got more rats
than a cheese factory.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.958
Where you think
they get all their money from?

30:58.041 --> 31:01.458
The pigs run
their whole operation.

31:01.541 --> 31:04.500
Well, lemme tell you what,
chump.

31:04.583 --> 31:08.166
When you lie with pigs,
you don't just get flies,

31:08.791 --> 31:10.333
you get Panthers,

31:11.333 --> 31:12.666
itching

31:12.750 --> 31:17.250
to blow your big, Uncle Tom,
watermelon-head off.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.083
Because what's a rat
to a big, black jungle cat?"

31:22.916 --> 31:24.125
Get your ass out here!

31:24.208 --> 31:25.708
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

31:25.791 --> 31:28.208
"When the Panthers are done
with the Crowns..."

31:28.291 --> 31:30.458
-[chuckles]
-Shit.

31:30.541 --> 31:34.000
"...they won't have
a watermelon-head
left to wear a crown on.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.583
Dig in?"

31:37.250 --> 31:38.375
"Dig in?"

31:42.000 --> 31:43.666
That you? This your work?

31:43.750 --> 31:45.625
-Brother, come on...
-[Tex] Dick Tracy!

31:45.708 --> 31:47.041
I see you traded in
your badge for...

31:47.125 --> 31:49.041
[Tex groans]

31:49.125 --> 31:51.125
Nigga, you know
not to speak outta turn.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.500
It's that motherfucker

31:52.583 --> 31:53.625
-that stole Ant's car.
-[Collins] Shut up!

31:54.458 --> 31:55.625
Apologize.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.791
-[Tex] Sorry.
-[Collins] Speak up.

32:00.833 --> 32:01.875
[Tex] Sorry!

32:10.666 --> 32:13.583
If that was us murder mouthin',
where our guns at, huh?

32:13.666 --> 32:16.208
We came to y'all headquarters
unarmed.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.125
So, who do you think
wrote it, then?

32:21.208 --> 32:22.333
[Fred] The pigs, who else?

32:22.416 --> 32:24.458
The pigs don't write, blood.

32:25.083 --> 32:27.208
The Feds do.

32:28.958 --> 32:31.166
They pulled the same shit
on Martin and Malcolm.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.250
[Steel] Mm-hmm.

32:32.333 --> 32:33.666
And what happened to them?

32:33.750 --> 32:35.416
Same shit that's gonna happen
to all of us.

32:37.041 --> 32:38.791
At least they died
for the people.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.583
We should be so lucky.

32:42.916 --> 32:45.416
[light jazzy music playing]

32:49.000 --> 32:50.208
[sighs]

33:08.708 --> 33:10.041
You gonna need this.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.833
Tread lightly, blood.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.041
[whistles]

33:29.458 --> 33:30.541
[scoffs]

33:39.916 --> 33:42.791
Hey, Chairman. Chairman.
Let me take that
off your hands.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.583
Maybe the Disciples
will be more receptive.

33:48.666 --> 33:52.416
You can bet the Disciples
got one of them
Fed letters, too.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.083
The pigs got ahead of us.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.750
Ah. So, what,
you ridin' with me?

34:10.833 --> 34:12.708
You got your piece on you,
comrade?

34:14.375 --> 34:16.041
Yeah, it's in the glove box.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.625
Why? What's up?

34:19.875 --> 34:21.916
[Judy clears throat]

You know what...

[thunder crashes]

34:41.416 --> 34:43.125
[Bill sighs softly]

34:47.833 --> 34:49.666
What was all that shit
about a badge?

34:50.500 --> 34:52.166
Badge?

34:52.250 --> 34:53.666
Man, what the fuck is your...
Ow!

34:53.750 --> 34:55.833
All right, all right,
all right!

34:55.916 --> 34:58.000
Calm down! Calm the fuck down!

34:58.083 --> 35:01.291
Can I talk to her?
Can I talk to her?

35:02.125 --> 35:04.333
[clears throat] All right.

35:05.875 --> 35:10.000
Y'all ain't gonna believe me,
all right?
But I used to...

35:10.083 --> 35:12.416
I used to pretend I was a Fed
back when I used
to boost cars...

35:12.500 --> 35:15.125
-[Jimmy] Shh.
-When I used to boost cars.

35:15.208 --> 35:17.375
What kinda fucking sense
does that make?

35:17.458 --> 35:19.375
A pig boosting cars.

35:19.458 --> 35:23.000
Now, what I would do
is I would pretend.
I show 'em a fake badge, right?

35:23.083 --> 35:25.375
And then I say
your car is reported stolen.

35:25.458 --> 35:28.625
And then I'd hop in it,
and I'd just ride. Just go.

35:28.708 --> 35:30.041
Before anybody
knew the difference,

35:30.125 --> 35:31.500
I was in the wind,
dig what I'm sayin'?

35:31.583 --> 35:33.250
You would be surprised
what they believe.

35:33.333 --> 35:35.458
You put on one of them coats
and the Humphrey Bogart hat...

35:35.541 --> 35:36.916
You steal this car?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.416
Yeah, no. Yeah, from a pimp.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.500
And a pimp believed
you were a Fed?

35:42.166 --> 35:43.708
Okay, so, I...

35:43.791 --> 35:45.375
What kinda amateur-hour macks
you be knowin' out here, man?

35:45.458 --> 35:47.208
I hot-wired this shit,
all right?

35:48.458 --> 35:49.416
All right?

35:50.916 --> 35:53.458
-Do it again.
-What?

35:53.541 --> 35:55.375
[Judy] You say
you hot-wired this shit,

35:55.458 --> 35:57.291
-so do it again.
-[gun cocks]

35:57.375 --> 35:59.333
Okay, look, look, uh...

35:59.416 --> 36:01.958
I ain't got no goddamn tools
on me right now
to do it right this second.

36:02.041 --> 36:03.708
Comrade, reach in my boot.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.916
Oh, come on now, y'all.

give me the motherfucker, man.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.416
Shit.

36:32.083 --> 36:34.166
All right, give me a second.
Give me a second.

36:35.750 --> 36:36.958

36:50.875 --> 36:52.708
Are you happy?

36:52.791 --> 36:54.958
How did you get keys
to a hot car?

36:59.791 --> 37:02.333
Now, you think in your mind,
I'm gonna pick up a stone fox

37:02.416 --> 37:04.083
in this bad motherfucker
right here,

37:04.166 --> 37:06.458
and start it up with a goddamn
screwdriver in the ignition?

37:06.541 --> 37:10.291
I had my boy replace the lock,
motherfucker. Come on, man.

37:10.375 --> 37:11.583
[chuckling]

37:13.416 --> 37:15.958
God dawg, man.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.041
Can you get
that motherfucker off me now?

37:19.416 --> 37:21.083
Shit. [laughs]

38:05.958 --> 38:07.666
[recording stops playing]

38:08.750 --> 38:10.250
[Fred] Mm-mm.

38:10.333 --> 38:13.500
Well, do you know his speech
<i>The Black Revolution?</i>

38:27.375 --> 38:30.125
"Sometimes,
when a person's house
is on fire...

38:31.625 --> 38:33.208
[chuckles]

38:33.291 --> 38:35.708
...and the person to whom
the house belongs to
is asleep...

38:35.791 --> 38:37.166
[chuckles]

38:37.250 --> 38:40.708
...if someone comes in
yelling 'fire,'

38:40.791 --> 38:44.750
instead of the person
to whom the house belongs to
being thankful...

38:44.833 --> 38:46.416
[chuckles]

38:46.500 --> 38:48.666
...they make the mistake
of charging the one
who awakened them

38:48.750 --> 38:50.416
with having set the fire.

38:52.625 --> 38:54.375
-I hope that--"
-"I hope that

38:54.458 --> 38:57.375
this little conversation
tonight about
the Black Revolution

38:57.458 --> 38:59.416
won't cause many of you

38:59.500 --> 39:03.375
-to accuse us
of igniting it..."
-"Igniting it..."

39:03.458 --> 39:05.458

"When you find it

[chuckles]

39:08.541 --> 39:09.625
[Fred] Mm-hmm.

39:10.541 --> 39:12.791
I listen to him every morning.

39:12.875 --> 39:15.916
I feel like he never lets folks
put words in his mouth,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.458
and no matter what,
he doesn't get flustered
or angry.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.250
I'd like to be like that
someday.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.625
Right on.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.625
Right on.

39:35.125 --> 39:38.333
Anyway, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.375
You want some coffee?

39:46.666 --> 39:47.625
Sure.

39:49.666 --> 39:50.875
How you take it?

39:51.750 --> 39:54.000
Black, and sweet.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.750
I did not expect you to be shy.

40:41.666 --> 40:43.083
Oh, I'm not shy.

[Bobby] We ain't talkin' about
some hippies playing bongos
in the park.

41:25.791 --> 41:28.750
These the same motherfuckers
hit Dr. King with a brick.

41:28.833 --> 41:31.958
[Jimmy] I don't know how I feel
about goin' up in there
without my pistol.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.166
[Fred] Right on.

41:36.458 --> 41:37.958
Best you stay behind, then.

[Fesperman]<i> Displace maybe two,</i>

41:47.875 --> 41:52.916
Well, they might think
it's easy to throw out
the white trash,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.041
but they better
fuckin' burn it!

41:57.958 --> 41:59.000
Whoo.

42:02.875 --> 42:04.291
You're Fred Hampton.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.625
You must be the Preacherman.

Well, I'm a fan
of y'all's paper.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.333
Funnies, especially.

[whispering] Comrade.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.375
Take it easy, comrade.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.333
It's just up there to remind us
of our Southern heritage.

42:25.416 --> 42:28.791
When I look at that,
I don't see no flag hanging.

42:28.875 --> 42:31.083
I see my uncle
hanging from a tree.

42:31.166 --> 42:33.583
And a bunch of white devils
like y'all
smiling around his body.

42:33.666 --> 42:35.208
Who the fuck
you think you're talkin' to?

42:35.291 --> 42:36.583
[Fesperman]
Hey, cool it, cool it!

42:36.666 --> 42:39.166
-You're in our house.
-Hey, cool it!

42:39.250 --> 42:41.791
Look, we oppressed your people
for a long time...

42:41.875 --> 42:45.541
I didn't oppress shit.
And my folks grew up poor.

42:45.625 --> 42:47.000
They were sharecroppers.

42:47.083 --> 42:49.041
AKA the overseer.

42:49.125 --> 42:51.083
What if the overseer
had banded with the slaves

42:51.166 --> 42:52.583
and cut the master's throat?

42:54.375 --> 42:55.916
What then, comrade?

42:59.458 --> 43:03.291
We might not be
in this funky-ass ghetto
right now.

43:03.375 --> 43:05.500
I'm not talking about
the West Side
or the South Side.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.208
I'm talkin'
this filthy-ass motherfucker
right here.

43:09.041 --> 43:10.625
Shit.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.208
We almost got into it
with a rat
over a parking space.

43:13.291 --> 43:16.166

by the same motherfuckin' pigs.

43:26.416 --> 43:27.750
Ain't that a trip?

43:28.458 --> 43:30.041
We pay them, huh?

43:30.125 --> 43:33.291
We pay the pigs
to run us off of our corners.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.583
Let me ask y'all somethin'.

43:38.416 --> 43:41.666
If this building caught fire
right now,
what would y'all worry about?

43:42.750 --> 43:45.000
Water and escape.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.500
If somebody were to ask you,

43:46.583 --> 43:47.833
"What's your culture
during this fire, brother?"

43:47.916 --> 43:50.250
"Water, that's my culture."

43:50.333 --> 43:53.208
"Well, how about
your politics?"
"Water and escape."

-[Mitchell] Nice work, Bill.
-[Bill smacks lips]

Chicago's
the most segregated city

Not Shreveport!

44:42.500 --> 44:44.000
Not Birmingham!

But we here to change that.

44:46.333 --> 44:48.750
[protesters shout in agreement]

The Black Panthers,
the Young Lords,
and the Young Patriots

44:52.583 --> 44:55.541

brothers and sisters
of every color!

why we gathered here today.

[men shout indistinctly]

Last week,

45:06.583 --> 45:10.250
our brother, Manuel Ramos,

45:10.333 --> 45:13.416
was shot in the head
and killed by an off-duty pig.

45:13.500 --> 45:16.625
[protesters exclaiming
and booing]

45:16.708 --> 45:20.958
So, we caught the pig
and turned him over
to his fellow pigs.

45:21.041 --> 45:23.500
[protesters cheer]

45:23.583 --> 45:25.708
And for some reason,

45:25.791 --> 45:27.666
we expected justice.

45:27.750 --> 45:30.958
[protesters booing]

45:31.041 --> 45:34.541
Well, let's see what they do,
now that we're in front
of the pigpen,

45:34.625 --> 45:37.500
and we demand
an independent investigation!

Get 'em off of me!

No, unless you...
They're like...

-[chuckles]
-But that's socialism, man.

46:05.958 --> 46:07.833
Well, you gotta warm 'em up,
though.

Well, how you think
Mao did the Long March, huh?

46:10.583 --> 46:12.000
[Deborah laughs]

46:12.083 --> 46:13.916
The Chinese would warm
these feet left and right.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
[Deborah] You saying
I'm a foot capitalist?

46:16.083 --> 46:18.875

I want him off the street.

46:31.083 --> 46:32.666
Charge him with something.
Anything.

But get his Black ass
off the street.

Of course, you're gonna wait

-You disgust me!

48:02.000 --> 48:03.208
They smoked one out.

48:03.291 --> 48:05.041
-In New Haven.
-How? How?

48:05.125 --> 48:08.125
They put a squeeze
on that motherfucker,
that's how, nigga.

48:08.208 --> 48:09.750
[George]
Now, I didn't say that.

48:10.875 --> 48:13.208
I said the brother
got some discipline

48:13.291 --> 48:15.666
in the area of the nose
and the mouth.

48:17.541 --> 48:20.958
And then,
the brother started to show
some cowardly tendencies, so,

48:21.041 --> 48:25.166
boiled some water, gave him
a little more discipline.

48:25.250 --> 48:27.041

His name is George Sams.

49:56.583 --> 49:58.500
George Sams.

49:58.583 --> 50:02.083
And who's the fella
they killed, this informant?

50:02.166 --> 50:03.916
His name is Alex Rackley.

50:04.041 --> 50:06.791
It's a guy outta New York.
I don't know,
I ain't never met him.

50:06.875 --> 50:08.041
But, shit, Roy...

50:08.125 --> 50:09.750
Where is Sams hiding now?

50:09.833 --> 50:12.166
[sighs]
He's hidin' at the office
for now.

50:12.250 --> 50:16.416
He say he's gonna skip town
and, you know, get outta here.

50:17.916 --> 50:21.375
Okay. I need you to draw up
a floor plan of the office.

50:21.458 --> 50:24.291
With this intel,
I can get authorization
for a raid.

50:24.375 --> 50:25.833
What?

50:25.916 --> 50:27.916
-Don't worry, Bill.
-What the fuck
are you talking--

50:28.000 --> 50:29.750
I will give you a heads-up,
so you can
make yourself scarce, okay?

50:29.833 --> 50:31.791
Roy, are you fuckin'
listenin' to me right now?

50:31.875 --> 50:34.708
They poured boiling water
all over this motherfucker,
you hear me?

50:34.791 --> 50:36.958
Yes, I understand.
I'm not surprised.

50:37.041 --> 50:39.750
What did I tell you?
No different from the Klan.

50:39.833 --> 50:40.916
Now you see.

50:45.875 --> 50:49.166
Look, now,
y'all gonna have to come up
off some serious fuckin' dough

50:49.250 --> 50:50.708
for this, all right?

50:51.791 --> 50:53.291
[Roy scoffs]

50:53.375 --> 50:57.958
I will make sure
you're properly compensated.

-Yeah?

51:01.416 --> 51:03.125
Sir.

51:03.208 --> 51:06.916
A Panther on the run
from Connecticut
is hiding out here in Chicago.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.583
Says he was part of a group
that killed another Panther.

51:11.666 --> 51:12.791
An informant.

51:12.875 --> 51:14.375
George Sams.

51:14.458 --> 51:16.500
Warrant's being written up
as we speak.

51:16.583 --> 51:18.666
We're going in on Wednesday.

51:19.541 --> 51:20.875
How'd you know?

51:20.958 --> 51:24.416
Sams is one of our guys.
Warrant's just a pretense.

51:26.291 --> 51:28.458
So, Sams is the informant?

51:28.541 --> 51:29.833
[Leslie] Mm-hmm.

51:29.916 --> 51:33.666
So, he didn't really kill,
uh...

51:36.166 --> 51:37.333
Alex Rackley?

51:37.416 --> 51:40.166
[scoffs] No, he did.

51:40.250 --> 51:42.833
Well, he claims two other guys
were the triggermen,

51:42.916 --> 51:44.708
but what's he gonna say?

51:48.208 --> 51:50.166
Forgive me, I'm confused.

51:50.250 --> 51:56.125
So, this kid, Alex Rackley,

51:56.208 --> 51:58.416
was labelled an informant
and then killed...

51:58.500 --> 51:59.500
[Leslie] Mm-hmm.

51:59.583 --> 52:02.250
...by an actual FBI informant.

52:04.666 --> 52:07.000
And we're just letting him
walk for murder?

52:07.083 --> 52:08.875
It's beautiful.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.250
He's on the lam, right?

52:11.333 --> 52:14.541
So, any time he goes
into a Panther office,

52:14.625 --> 52:18.541
we get a warrant
for harboring a fugitive.

52:18.625 --> 52:21.541
He's in the interview room
right now
with our liaison guys,

52:21.625 --> 52:24.166
planning the next stop
on his little tour.

52:26.708 --> 52:29.416
Wow. That's, uh...

52:46.958 --> 52:48.333

his damn self.

52:48.416 --> 52:50.375
No, nigga. Because they took
the donor rolls,

52:50.458 --> 52:52.583

all these goddamn binders here.

52:52.666 --> 52:53.833
You understand
what I'm saying?

52:53.916 --> 52:55.291
They went straight
for the safe.

52:55.375 --> 52:56.916
Then, they went straight
into the weapons cabinet,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
which is right
in the fuckin' slop closet.

52:59.083 --> 53:00.541
It's like they knew
where everything was.

53:00.625 --> 53:02.416
-Hey, smarten up, brother.
-[Bill] What?

53:02.500 --> 53:04.041
You're fallin'
right into the pigs' trap.

53:04.125 --> 53:06.541
[Bill] What the fuck

53:06.625 --> 53:08.208
You know, Jimmy,
maybe you a goddamn pig.

53:08.291 --> 53:09.791

-What? Man, fuck you, nigga!

1:00:16.250 --> 1:00:17.333
Fuck.

1:00:23.416 --> 1:00:24.500
Fuck.

1:00:25.416 --> 1:00:26.416
[Carcetti] Watch your backs!

1:00:26.500 --> 1:00:27.541
[Williams] Look at that window!

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:29.375
[Carcetti] Hold your positions!

1:00:29.458 --> 1:00:30.833
[Williams] Do you guys see
any other weapons
besides those?

1:00:30.916 --> 1:00:31.916
Is there any visuals?

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.541
[siren wailing]

1:00:36.125 --> 1:00:37.250
Sniper!

1:00:37.333 --> 1:00:38.416
-God...
-[gunshots]

1:00:40.791 --> 1:00:42.250
-[shotgun firing]
-[grunts]

1:00:42.333 --> 1:00:44.500
[intense music playing]

1:00:56.125 --> 1:00:58.000
[Judy grunting]

1:00:59.333 --> 1:01:01.250
[gunfire continues]

1:01:06.625 --> 1:01:08.416
[crowd clamoring]

1:01:16.750 --> 1:01:18.958
I hate you! You swine!

1:01:19.041 --> 1:01:20.250
[officer] Keep 'em back!

1:01:21.958 --> 1:01:24.041
[Judy grunting]

1:01:28.750 --> 1:01:30.416
White! You okay?

1:01:34.333 --> 1:01:36.000
[Judy grunting loudly]

1:01:37.083 --> 1:01:38.416
Fuck, I'm out!

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.791
[gunfire continues]

1:01:41.875 --> 1:01:44.583
[crowd clamoring]

1:01:44.666 --> 1:01:45.916
[Judy] Stop shootin'!
We comin' out!

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.125
[White] Comin' out!

1:01:47.208 --> 1:01:49.500
[Judy] We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1:01:49.583 --> 1:01:52.833
<i>Cease fire! Cease fire!</i>

1:01:52.916 --> 1:01:55.958
<i>God damn it!</i>
<i>God damn it, cease fire!</i>

1:01:58.208 --> 1:02:00.500
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

1:02:08.250 --> 1:02:09.958
[Judy] Comin' out!
We're comin' out!
Don't shoot!

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:12.125
[Captain]<i> Cease fire!</i>
<i>Cease fire!</i>

1:02:12.208 --> 1:02:13.708
[officer] Drop your weapon!

1:02:13.791 --> 1:02:15.750
-[officer 2] Move in! Move in!
-[Carcetti] Motherfucker!

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:17.500
[White groans]

1:02:17.583 --> 1:02:19.083
[Judy groaning]

1:02:19.166 --> 1:02:20.500
[crowd jeering]

1:02:20.583 --> 1:02:21.791
-No!
-[man] Let her go!

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:23.000
[man 2] That's a woman, man!

1:02:23.083 --> 1:02:24.083
What the fuck happened?

1:02:24.166 --> 1:02:25.791
[man 2] What you doing?

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:28.291
[Carcetti]
Get 'em in the fuckin' wagon!

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:30.083
Get in the building.
I need to blow the building!

1:02:30.166 --> 1:02:32.666
I need explosives
inside the building!

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:35.250
Keep 'em back! Keep 'em back!

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:44.625
[man] Let 'em go! Let 'em go!

1:02:44.708 --> 1:02:47.166
They're gonna burn it down.
They're gonna burn it down!

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:50.375
No! Get off of me! No!

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.583
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1:02:57.666 --> 1:02:59.833
[dramatic music playing]

1:03:06.041 --> 1:03:07.000
[explosion]

1:03:07.083 --> 1:03:08.166
[crowd gasping]

1:03:17.875 --> 1:03:19.833
[footsteps]

1:03:19.916 --> 1:03:20.958
[keys jingling]

1:03:21.041 --> 1:03:22.541
[metal creaking]

1:03:24.291 --> 1:03:26.041
[warden] It's over.

1:03:32.833 --> 1:03:34.958
[footsteps recede]

1:03:35.708 --> 1:03:37.291
[paper rustles]

1:03:50.791 --> 1:03:52.458
[sighs heavily]

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:59.500
[phone ringing]

1:04:01.083 --> 1:04:02.333
Mitchell.

1:04:02.416 --> 1:04:03.875
[Bill]<i> Hey, listen,</i>
<i>I'm out, Roy. I'm out!</i>

1:04:03.958 --> 1:04:06.166
Calm down. Calm down, Bill.

1:04:06.250 --> 1:04:08.458
<i>Don't you tell me</i>
<i>to fuckin' calm down,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1:04:08.541 --> 1:04:10.125
I was almost killed, man!

1:04:10.208 --> 1:04:13.416
Now, Fred's in jail,
I did the damn job,
and I'm out!

1:04:13.500 --> 1:04:15.166
<i>No, that's not how it works.</i>

1:04:15.250 --> 1:04:17.000
What the fuck do you mean,
"That's not how it works"?

1:04:17.083 --> 1:04:18.708
<i>Why don't you give me</i>
<i>one good reason</i>

1:04:18.791 --> 1:04:20.125
<i>why I don't just book it</i>
<i>outta here right now?</i>

1:04:20.208 --> 1:04:21.750
Because... [hesitates]

1:04:21.833 --> 1:04:23.958
Because, as I've mentioned,

1:04:24.041 --> 1:04:26.083
it's a year and a half
for the stolen car,

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:28.916
and five years
for impersonating
a federal officer.

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.625
<i>And if you run,</i>
<i>I will hunt you down,</i>
<i>you understand...</i>

1:04:32.708 --> 1:04:34.666
Man, shut the fuck up!

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:40.625
Fuck!

1:04:40.708 --> 1:04:42.875
-[Bobby]<i> What do we need?</i>
-[Bill]<i> What do you mean?</i>

1:04:42.958 --> 1:04:44.833
You the handyman.
Oakland says
rebuild immediately.

1:04:44.916 --> 1:04:46.541
What do we need?

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:48.416
We need
a goddamn white flag, Bobby!
You don't see this shit?

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:52.291
-Don't you understand
this shit is...
-[boy] God damn!

1:04:52.375 --> 1:04:54.291
They burnt the shit
out this motherfucker.

1:04:54.375 --> 1:04:55.458
[Bill] You're goddamn right,
they did.

1:04:55.541 --> 1:04:56.875
[boy 2] Watch your mouth, man!

1:04:58.083 --> 1:04:59.750
Y'all need help?

1:05:00.750 --> 1:05:02.500
Yeah, little brother.

1:05:02.583 --> 1:05:05.958
Um, go on down to the store
and get us
a couple of trash cans.

1:05:06.041 --> 1:05:07.375
[clears throat]

1:05:08.875 --> 1:05:11.458
That's how you rebuild,
comrade.

1:05:13.166 --> 1:05:15.083
[hammering]

1:05:18.333 --> 1:05:21.500
Hey! Hey! Can I help y'all?

1:05:21.583 --> 1:05:23.333
We came to ask y'all that.

1:05:23.416 --> 1:05:24.875
Got some bodies
if you need 'em.

1:05:24.958 --> 1:05:27.750
Look, I know y'all got an army
and all that,

1:05:27.833 --> 1:05:29.833
but figured y'all could use
some reserves.

1:05:32.458 --> 1:05:34.000
Oh, right on.

1:05:34.083 --> 1:05:35.625
Y'all know how to use
a tape measure?

1:05:35.708 --> 1:05:37.666
'Cause this needs measurin'
right here, all right?

1:05:37.750 --> 1:05:39.208
And then that drywall
right there

1:05:39.291 --> 1:05:41.166
needs to be measured out
and flushed,

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:42.833
you know, how I got it here.

1:05:42.916 --> 1:05:44.833
And the rest of y'all can grab
some of these paint rollers,

1:05:44.916 --> 1:05:46.750
and help 'em with that wall.

1:05:46.833 --> 1:05:48.791
Yeah, right there is good.

1:05:50.625 --> 1:05:52.833
[indistinct chatter]

1:05:52.916 --> 1:05:54.500
[scoffs softly]

1:05:54.583 --> 1:05:59.375
[Hoover] Los Angeles leaders
Bunchy Carter and John Huggins.

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:03.708
Well, former leaders.

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:07.708
Chalk marks, all that's left.

1:06:08.625 --> 1:06:11.708
Our friend, Mr. Cleaver...

1:06:11.791 --> 1:06:14.541
[chuckles]
On the lam in Algeria.

1:06:14.625 --> 1:06:17.083
A gift from our friends
at Langley.

1:06:17.166 --> 1:06:18.875
-[Roy] Hmm.
-[Hoover] Oh.

1:06:18.958 --> 1:06:22.750
Look who's here. [chuckles]
Our old friend, Bobby Seale.

1:06:22.833 --> 1:06:25.458
You recognize this
from the evening news,
all bundled up.

1:06:25.541 --> 1:06:29.041
It must be very cold
in that Chicago courtroom.

1:06:30.583 --> 1:06:32.541
Speaking of Seale,

1:06:32.625 --> 1:06:35.291
if the Seale verdict
does not fall our way,

1:06:35.375 --> 1:06:39.583
we have a witness
who'll testify he ordered
a hit in Connecticut.

1:06:39.666 --> 1:06:43.375
I believe you're familiar
with George Sams,
Agent Mitchell?

1:06:44.041 --> 1:06:45.458
[laughs]

1:06:47.250 --> 1:06:49.041
Yes, sir.

1:06:49.125 --> 1:06:52.458
[Hoover] Very well.
Have a seat, gentlemen.

1:07:05.833 --> 1:07:08.500
How are the boys,
Jack and Tyler?

1:07:09.333 --> 1:07:11.083
Good, sir.

1:07:14.458 --> 1:07:15.916
Thank you. Uh...

1:07:17.083 --> 1:07:20.250
Tyler just started
Little League.

1:07:20.333 --> 1:07:22.958
Kid's got quite an arm on him.

1:07:25.166 --> 1:07:26.625
And your daughter, Samantha,

1:07:26.708 --> 1:07:30.416
she must be, what,
eight months now, is it?

1:07:34.458 --> 1:07:36.291
That's right.

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:42.250
She's growing fast every day.

1:07:42.333 --> 1:07:44.208
They always do, don't they?

1:07:44.875 --> 1:07:46.375
Tell me...

1:07:48.416 --> 1:07:52.625
What will you do
when she brings home a Negro?

1:07:57.041 --> 1:07:59.291
When she brings home a Negro?

1:07:59.375 --> 1:08:01.125
Your daughter, Samantha.

1:08:01.208 --> 1:08:06.125
What will you do the day
she brings home
a young Negro male?

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:12.666
She's an infant, sir.

1:08:12.750 --> 1:08:14.375
I'm well aware.

1:08:16.333 --> 1:08:18.916
And that's not an answer
to my question.

1:08:29.916 --> 1:08:32.000
She won't.

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:33.750
Why not?

1:08:39.958 --> 1:08:41.875
Because...

1:08:47.208 --> 1:08:52.833
Respectfully, Director,
why are we talking about
my daughter?

1:08:52.916 --> 1:08:54.375
You killed in Korea.

1:08:54.458 --> 1:08:55.500
Yes.

1:08:55.583 --> 1:08:57.916
Not for country.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.708
Maybe that's why you enlisted.
But you killed for survival.

1:09:02.791 --> 1:09:04.875
You would have done anything

1:09:04.958 --> 1:09:08.000
to get back home safe
to your family, wouldn't you?

1:09:08.666 --> 1:09:10.000
Of course.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.291
Think of your family now,
Agent Mitchell.

1:09:16.791 --> 1:09:19.375
When you look at Hampton,
think of Samantha,

1:09:19.458 --> 1:09:22.708
because that's what's at stake
if we lose this war.

1:09:23.791 --> 1:09:25.750
Our entire way of life.

1:09:29.125 --> 1:09:32.083
Rape, pillage, conquer.

1:09:32.708 --> 1:09:34.250
You follow me?

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:38.041
I do, sir.

1:09:38.125 --> 1:09:39.583
Hampton's in Menard
doing two to five.

1:09:39.666 --> 1:09:41.250
[Hoover]
Hampton is getting out,

1:09:41.333 --> 1:09:44.375
while the State Supreme Court
considers his appeal.

1:09:44.458 --> 1:09:45.958
In the interim,

1:09:46.041 --> 1:09:48.291
your CI is our best chance

1:09:48.375 --> 1:09:51.291
at neutralizing him,
Agent Mitchell.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.625
<i>Maybe it's time to use O'Neal</i>
<i>more creatively.</i>

1:10:01.250 --> 1:10:04.041
[soft piano music playing]

1:10:45.958 --> 1:10:48.625
You look beautiful,
you know that?

1:10:48.708 --> 1:10:50.291
-You know that?
-Mm-hmm.

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.708
[laughter nearby]

1:11:03.791 --> 1:11:05.541
[Bill] Whoo!

1:11:05.625 --> 1:11:06.916
Now, y'all save that shit

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.291
for when you get back
to the house, all right?

1:11:08.375 --> 1:11:09.750
[both chuckle]

1:11:15.125 --> 1:11:17.250
-Careful, now.
-[chuckles]

1:11:17.333 --> 1:11:18.416
[Jeff] Whew!

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:20.375
You look good, Chairman!

1:11:21.083 --> 1:11:22.500
How ya feelin'?

1:11:22.583 --> 1:11:25.000
I miss y'all motherfuckers,
man!

1:11:25.083 --> 1:11:26.791
-[all laugh]
-Come on, man!

1:11:26.875 --> 1:11:29.125
Yeah, so where you wanna go?
You hungry? What?
What do you want?

1:11:31.833 --> 1:11:33.708
Headquarters.

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:37.041
[Bill] Mm-hmm.

1:11:37.125 --> 1:11:39.375
Shit, headquarters it is, boy.

1:11:39.458 --> 1:11:41.041
[engine starts]

1:12:02.666 --> 1:12:04.958
How'd y'all...

1:12:06.291 --> 1:12:07.750
But it was burned down.
I saw...

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:09.708
[Bobby] Then the whole
neighborhood came out.

1:12:09.791 --> 1:12:13.583
The pushers, the grannies,
the Crowns. Everybody.

1:12:15.083 --> 1:12:16.583
'Specially this one right here.

1:12:16.666 --> 1:12:18.458
-He practically led the charge.
-Come on, now, man.

1:12:18.541 --> 1:12:20.791
[Bobby]
Don't be modest, brother.
You almost lived here.

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.791
Power.

1:12:39.416 --> 1:12:41.458
Anywhere there's people,

1:12:43.375 --> 1:12:44.916
there's power.

1:12:46.291 --> 1:12:47.916
Right on.

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:55.416
Thank you, brother.

1:13:02.458 --> 1:13:03.375
[door opens]

1:13:03.458 --> 1:13:04.833
[Jake] Chairman!

1:13:04.916 --> 1:13:06.458
-Oh!
-[woman laughs]

1:13:06.541 --> 1:13:08.875
I was wondering
why it was so quiet, man.

1:13:08.958 --> 1:13:10.250
-[laughter]
-I was like,

1:13:10.333 --> 1:13:11.416
"These motherfuckers
better be out here

1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:13.083
feedin' these babies overtime

1:13:13.166 --> 1:13:14.041
if they're not gonna welcome
a brother home, God damn it!"

1:13:14.125 --> 1:13:15.291
Come on, man!

1:13:15.375 --> 1:13:16.625
[Jake] You made it.

1:13:16.708 --> 1:13:18.500
[Fred] Oh, man, I missed
y'all motherfuckers, man.

1:13:18.583 --> 1:13:20.250
-[Jake]
We missed you, too, man!
-[Fred] Oh, my God.

1:13:20.333 --> 1:13:22.458
[Jake] You know
I missed you, too, man!

[people clapping and cheering]

1:13:23.875 --> 1:13:25.791
[Fred] Yeah, brother.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:13:25.875 --> 1:13:27.125
[Jake] All right,
let me outta here!

1:13:27.208 --> 1:13:28.708
Let me outta here!
Let me outta here!

1:13:28.791 --> 1:13:30.041
[Fred] You the man.
You stay in here and man up!

All that complainin'...

1:13:36.458 --> 1:13:38.125
[Doc Satchel] Right on,
how's it going, brother?

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:48.541
Rush?

1:13:48.625 --> 1:13:51.166
I feel your pain, sister.

1:13:51.250 --> 1:13:53.250
But we at war, you know?

1:13:53.333 --> 1:13:56.125
[Doc Satchel] He's gone.

1:13:56.208 --> 1:13:58.208
-[Fred] Excuse me, sister.
-[woman] All right.

1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:04.250
What's up?

1:14:07.375 --> 1:14:09.291
Jimmy Palmer died.

1:14:10.541 --> 1:14:12.125
What? How?

1:14:12.208 --> 1:14:13.666
[Bobby]
Can we talk about this outside,
Fred, please?

1:14:13.750 --> 1:14:15.333
He was shot
while you were gone.

1:14:15.416 --> 1:14:17.000
Comrade, why is this the first
I'm hearin' about this, man?

1:14:17.083 --> 1:14:18.041
Who was shot?

1:14:19.708 --> 1:14:21.333
Jimmy Palmer.

1:14:21.416 --> 1:14:23.000
Yeah, he's fine.
Y'all know that.

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:24.666
He died, Jake.

1:14:25.666 --> 1:14:26.708
Last night.

1:14:26.791 --> 1:14:27.958
Nah, that's impossible.

1:14:29.208 --> 1:14:31.375
I just talked to him
the other day.

1:14:33.708 --> 1:14:35.000
Anybody got the number
for Loretto...

1:14:35.083 --> 1:14:36.916
He was moved
to the county hospital.

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.208
Get this fuckin'...

1:14:38.291 --> 1:14:40.666
Get this shit off of me.
Hey, motherfuck...

1:14:40.750 --> 1:14:42.666
They killed him.

1:14:42.750 --> 1:14:44.625
They fuckin' killed him.

1:14:46.541 --> 1:14:47.958
[Bobby] Jake.

1:14:52.875 --> 1:14:54.333

1:16:21.541 --> 1:16:22.916
[Fred] Drummer,
lemme hear the people beat!

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:26.333
[upbeat drum music playing]

1:16:26.416 --> 1:16:28.375
This is what we call
the people beat.

1:16:28.458 --> 1:16:31.583
Started in 1966 by Huey Newton
and Bobby Seale.

1:16:31.666 --> 1:16:34.708
It's the beat that manifests
in you, the people.

1:16:34.791 --> 1:16:36.458
They can't never stop the party

1:16:36.541 --> 1:16:38.333
-unless they stop the people!
-[crowd cheers]

1:16:38.416 --> 1:16:41.958
-Well, ain't you high?
Ain't you high?
-[crowd cheers]

1:16:42.041 --> 1:16:45.125
-I'm high off the people!
-[crowd cheers]

1:16:45.208 --> 1:16:47.166
-I'm high!
-I'm high!

1:16:47.250 --> 1:16:49.041
-[Fred] I'm high!
-I'm high!

-...off the people!
-[crowd] ...off the people!

1:16:55.208 --> 1:16:57.375
So, if you were asked
to make a commitment at age 20,

1:16:57.458 --> 1:17:00.833
and you said,
"I'm too young to die,"
then you're dead already!

1:17:00.916 --> 1:17:04.541
[crowd groans, then cheers]

1:17:08.291 --> 1:17:10.500
If you dare to struggle,
you dare to win!

1:17:10.583 --> 1:17:14.541
If you dare not struggle,
then, God damn it,
you don't deserve to win!

1:17:17.291 --> 1:17:19.625

1:17:25.208 --> 1:17:27.625

1:17:27.708 --> 1:17:31.000
Put a fist in the air
for Comrade Jimmy Palmer.

1:17:36.666 --> 1:17:41.708
Jimmy Palmer died
a revolutionary death.

1:17:41.791 --> 1:17:47.708
He stood face-to-face
and toe-to-toe
with pig Daley's henchmen,

1:17:47.791 --> 1:17:51.000
and made the greatest sacrifice
one could ever make.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:52.583
-[crowd cheering]
-Right on!

1:17:52.666 --> 1:17:54.500

1:18:00.541 --> 1:18:03.541
I don't believe I'm gonna die
in no car wreck!

1:18:03.625 --> 1:18:06.625
I don't believe I'm gonna die
slippin' on no ice!

1:18:06.708 --> 1:18:10.458
I don't believe I'm gonna die
'cause I got a bad heart!

1:18:10.541 --> 1:18:13.791
I believe I'm gonna die
doin' what I was born for!

1:18:13.875 --> 1:18:16.541
I believe I'm gonna die
high off the people!

1:18:16.625 --> 1:18:18.208
[crowd exclaims]

1:18:18.291 --> 1:18:20.916
I'm gonna die for the people,
'cause I live for the people!

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.541
I live for the people,
'cause I love the people!

-[crowd cheering]
-[upbeat drum music continues]

1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:34.083
And as for them bloodthirsty,
murderous pigs...

1:18:34.166 --> 1:18:36.375
Well, some of you might be
in the audience right now, huh?

1:18:36.458 --> 1:18:37.708
[crowd clamors]

1:18:37.791 --> 1:18:40.625
Sittin' on a tape recorder,
gun in your hand!

1:18:40.708 --> 1:18:43.125
Well, lemme make it plain.

1:18:43.208 --> 1:18:45.791
Kill a few pigs,
get a little satisfaction.

1:18:49.291 --> 1:18:50.750
Right on. Right on.

1:18:52.375 --> 1:18:55.250
Kill some more pigs,
get some more satisfaction.

1:18:55.333 --> 1:18:56.625
[crowd cheers]

1:18:56.708 --> 1:18:59.375

Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1:19:14.833 --> 1:19:18.500
It's not a question of violence
or non-violence.

1:19:18.583 --> 1:19:20.833
It's a question of
resistance to fascism

1:19:20.916 --> 1:19:23.208
or non-existence
within fascism!

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:25.000
[crowd cheers]

1:19:25.083 --> 1:19:27.958
You can murder a liberator,
but you can't murder
liberation!

1:19:28.041 --> 1:19:31.500
You can murder a revolutionary,
but you can't murder
a revolution!

1:19:31.583 --> 1:19:35.375
And you can murder
a freedom fighter,
but you can't murder freedom!

-Winters, fuck you doin' here?
-[breathing heavily]

1:20:19.083 --> 1:20:21.416
Lookin' for some answers.

1:20:21.500 --> 1:20:23.666
Answers to what?

1:20:23.750 --> 1:20:27.333
Remember I saw you
not too long ago
at the hospital?

1:20:27.416 --> 1:20:28.500
Yeah.

1:20:29.625 --> 1:20:32.541
The pigs took my man
outta there.

1:20:32.625 --> 1:20:34.375
I don't know nothin'
about that.

1:20:34.458 --> 1:20:37.541
No, look, I was thinking
maybe you could ask
a couple questions.

1:20:37.625 --> 1:20:39.916
And fuck my money up?

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.416
Nigga, do you have any idea

1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:43.416
how treacherous
them crackers is
down there?

1:20:43.500 --> 1:20:45.416
-I don't want no parts of that.
-Reg, please. Please, man.

1:20:45.500 --> 1:20:50.250
Look, man,
I'm cold and I'm hungry.
Now, get out my way.

1:20:50.333 --> 1:20:52.000
Come on, brother!

1:20:52.083 --> 1:20:53.875
I ain't your brother!

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:56.916
Now, get the fuck off my porch
before you end up
like your boy did.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.541
Man, fuck...

1:21:00.875 --> 1:21:05.458
No, I just wanted to know
what happened.
Reg! Hey, Reg!

1:21:05.541 --> 1:21:08.250
I just wanted to know
what happened to my friend!

1:21:08.916 --> 1:21:10.583
Reg!

1:21:12.083 --> 1:21:13.291
[Reg] Yeah.

1:21:13.375 --> 1:21:14.958
Reg!

1:21:16.333 --> 1:21:18.916
[Reg] Across the street
from the oil refinery.

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:20.791
Uh, Lawn... Lawndale and 45th.

1:21:22.958 --> 1:21:26.416
He... He's got a gun.
A big one.

1:22:01.208 --> 1:22:06.791
[Deborah] What are you doin'?
That's private! It's private...

1:22:06.875 --> 1:22:08.583
You think you gonna be
a bad mother?

1:22:09.625 --> 1:22:10.750
It was a question.

1:22:10.833 --> 1:22:12.791
Why you gotta
ask yourself that?

1:22:15.083 --> 1:22:17.125
I don't... I don't know.

1:22:17.208 --> 1:22:21.875
Maybe the fact
that I'm bringin' a child
into a war zone.

1:22:21.958 --> 1:22:25.250
These aren't considerations
you have to make.

1:22:25.333 --> 1:22:26.541
You get to go out there,

1:22:26.625 --> 1:22:28.458
talk about dyin'
a revolutionary death

1:22:28.541 --> 1:22:31.208
and how your body belong
to the revolution,

1:22:31.291 --> 1:22:35.583
because you don't have
another person
growin' inside your body.

1:22:38.250 --> 1:22:39.500
[sighs]

1:22:40.291 --> 1:22:42.000
So, you regret it?

1:22:42.083 --> 1:22:44.208
-What?
-Havin' my baby.

1:22:46.333 --> 1:22:47.875
Do you?

1:22:51.541 --> 1:22:55.208
When I dedicated
my life to the people,
I dedicated my life.

1:22:55.750 --> 1:22:57.125
You dig?

1:22:59.958 --> 1:23:03.041
And it wasn't till Menard
when I realized what that...

1:23:03.125 --> 1:23:05.291
When I realized
what that meant.

1:23:06.708 --> 1:23:09.541
'Cause in order
to survive in there,

1:23:12.291 --> 1:23:14.708
a part of me had to die, man.

1:23:16.750 --> 1:23:21.208
You couldn't have told me that,
when I got out,

1:23:23.583 --> 1:23:25.375
that I have...

1:23:26.541 --> 1:23:29.250
That I'd had
every reason to live.

1:23:36.333 --> 1:23:38.458
So, do you regret it?

1:23:41.291 --> 1:23:42.666
Do you?

1:23:44.833 --> 1:23:45.958
Uh...

1:23:47.333 --> 1:23:50.125
I wanna... I wanna
share somethin' with you.

1:24:03.208 --> 1:24:07.375
"Like the masses, I was in awe,

1:24:07.458 --> 1:24:10.958
when I first laid eyes
on all the things you are.

1:24:12.291 --> 1:24:14.666
I heard that speech,

1:24:15.875 --> 1:24:18.083
and when that indent
pierced your cheek,

1:24:18.166 --> 1:24:19.958
I knew we'd make noise.

1:24:20.041 --> 1:24:24.958
I just... I thought
it'd be in the streets.

1:24:25.041 --> 1:24:28.250
What magic a philistine
and a poet could create."

1:24:28.333 --> 1:24:29.958
A philistine?
Who you callin' a philistine?

1:24:30.041 --> 1:24:33.166
You're seriously
interrupting me right now?

1:24:35.833 --> 1:24:41.291
"What magic a philistine
and a poet could create.

1:24:41.375 --> 1:24:44.916
However contradictory,
it would seem that it's fate.

1:24:47.083 --> 1:24:53.333
We educate, we nurture,
we feed, and we lobby.

1:24:53.416 --> 1:24:57.166

<i>than just war</i>
<i>with these bodies."</i>

1:25:00.125 --> 1:25:01.833
[officers shouting
indistinctly]

1:25:06.083 --> 1:25:07.583
[gasping]

1:25:07.666 --> 1:25:11.041
[Deborah]<i> "Will my comrades</i>
<i>think me treasonous?</i>

1:25:11.125 --> 1:25:13.750
Can it please
have your dimples?

1:25:15.625 --> 1:25:19.166
Will my chairman
look at me differently?

1:25:19.250 --> 1:25:21.458
Will its eyes
have your twinkle?

1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:25.000
[page turns]

1:25:25.083 --> 1:25:27.250
Will our child be
the apple of his eye?

1:25:27.333 --> 1:25:31.166
Or constantly
get the compromise?

1:25:31.250 --> 1:25:36.583
The rata-tat-tat of gunfire,
the clink of jail cells,
lullabies.

1:25:38.541 --> 1:25:40.375
We scream,

1:25:40.458 --> 1:25:45.208
and we shout,
and we live by this anthem,

1:25:45.291 --> 1:25:49.500
but is power to the people
really worth that ransom?

1:25:49.583 --> 1:25:52.375
[sniffles] 'Cause that's
what a mother does.

1:25:52.458 --> 1:25:55.708
She gives the world
the most precious things
that she loves.

1:25:55.791 --> 1:25:59.041
And I love you,
and I love our baby, too,

1:25:59.125 --> 1:26:03.041
and there's nothing
more radical
than seein' that through.

1:26:04.458 --> 1:26:08.541
Born pure to the blood,
with the heart of a Panther.

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:12.375
<i>So, no regrets.</i>

1:26:15.666 --> 1:26:17.291
<i>I know my answer."</i>

[tense music continues]

1:27:17.625 --> 1:27:18.750
[grunting]

1:27:18.833 --> 1:27:20.000
Oh, shit.

1:27:23.458 --> 1:27:24.708
[officer] Please.

1:27:24.791 --> 1:27:27.125
[Jake panting heavily]

1:27:27.208 --> 1:27:28.541
Please.

1:27:30.333 --> 1:27:31.708
Please.

1:27:38.958 --> 1:27:40.416
-Please, no!
-[gun fires]

1:27:42.458 --> 1:27:44.208
[officer 2] Hey!

1:27:44.291 --> 1:27:46.916
[gunshots]

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.416
[body thuds]

1:27:57.791 --> 1:27:59.458
[engine stops]

1:28:01.750 --> 1:28:03.041
[car door shuts]

1:28:09.750 --> 1:28:11.541
[panting]

1:28:16.875 --> 1:28:18.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:28:18.125 --> 1:28:20.041
Hey. Hey, don't shoot me.
Don't shoot.

1:28:20.125 --> 1:28:21.458
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

1:28:21.541 --> 1:28:24.708
I'm not a rat.
I'm not a rat, I swear.

1:28:24.791 --> 1:28:26.041
[gasps]

1:28:30.125 --> 1:28:31.333
[grunts]

1:28:34.041 --> 1:28:35.541
[phone ringing]

1:28:36.250 --> 1:28:37.416
[sighs]

1:28:39.875 --> 1:28:41.750
[ringing continues]

1:28:48.041 --> 1:28:48.958
Thank you.

1:28:49.041 --> 1:28:50.708
You're welcome.

1:28:52.583 --> 1:28:54.250
Do you want me to get that?

1:28:56.250 --> 1:28:59.083
It's probably
one of them crank callers.

1:28:59.166 --> 1:29:03.416
As if it ain't bad enough
I'll never see my son again.

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:06.500
You think the mothers
of those police officers

1:29:06.583 --> 1:29:09.958
that killed the Soto brothers
are getting harassed like this?

1:29:10.041 --> 1:29:11.166
Please.

1:29:11.250 --> 1:29:12.833
[ringing continues]

1:29:20.333 --> 1:29:22.083
I know what you're gonna say,
but...

1:29:22.166 --> 1:29:25.041
No. No, stop. Stop that.

1:29:30.291 --> 1:29:32.166
I'm sorry, Mrs. Winters.

1:29:33.666 --> 1:29:37.291
[clicks tongue]
Let's talk about
something else.

1:29:37.375 --> 1:29:40.041
[chuckles] How's Deborah?

1:29:41.583 --> 1:29:43.083
Tired of being pregnant.

1:29:43.166 --> 1:29:45.750
[both laugh]

1:29:45.833 --> 1:29:47.333
Yeah.

1:29:47.416 --> 1:29:48.916
Yeah.

1:29:49.875 --> 1:29:52.125
Tell her to cherish it.

1:29:52.208 --> 1:29:53.833
All of it.

1:29:54.916 --> 1:29:57.666
Those early days are...

1:30:00.583 --> 1:30:05.250
You know, even when I think
about Jake in my mind,

1:30:05.333 --> 1:30:07.833
he's always seven.

1:30:07.916 --> 1:30:09.291
That's how I remember him.

1:30:10.375 --> 1:30:12.291
My little boy.

1:30:15.625 --> 1:30:19.416
I remember,
one time in church, he said...

1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:21.750
"Mama, may I be excused?"

1:30:21.833 --> 1:30:23.416
I said, "Why, Jake?"

1:30:23.500 --> 1:30:26.791
You know, figuring he was bored
or something.

1:30:26.875 --> 1:30:31.333
And he goes,
"Mama, I gotta pass gas."

1:30:31.416 --> 1:30:33.625
[both laugh]

1:30:34.291 --> 1:30:35.416
Sound like Jake.

1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:36.750
Yeah.

1:30:42.333 --> 1:30:43.458
[Fred] Yeah.

1:30:46.416 --> 1:30:48.916
So well-behaved.

1:30:51.166 --> 1:30:53.500
Just the sweetest little thing.

1:30:56.458 --> 1:30:58.083
[Mrs. Winters] Mmm.

1:31:01.750 --> 1:31:04.208
Those folks, though,

1:31:04.291 --> 1:31:08.041
they try to paint my Jake
as some cold-blooded killer.

1:31:10.500 --> 1:31:14.291
He did that. [chuckles]
He did that.

1:31:16.791 --> 1:31:19.166
But that ain't all he did.

1:31:20.625 --> 1:31:23.125
Tell 'em about my Jake,
Chairman.

1:31:23.208 --> 1:31:24.083
I will do.

1:31:24.166 --> 1:31:25.541
[voice breaking] Please.

1:31:28.416 --> 1:31:29.666
Yes.

1:31:34.791 --> 1:31:35.916
[sighs]

1:31:39.625 --> 1:31:44.958
It don't seem fair
that that's his legacy.

1:31:51.291 --> 1:31:52.416
[Bill] Here.

1:31:55.041 --> 1:31:57.083
C-4.

1:31:57.166 --> 1:31:58.500
Yeah, we got enough there,

1:31:58.583 --> 1:32:00.375
we could blow up city hall,
some more shit.

1:32:00.458 --> 1:32:01.458
Fuck is wrong with you?

1:32:01.541 --> 1:32:02.875
Calm down, comrade, calm down.

1:32:02.958 --> 1:32:04.583
What you mean,
what's wrong with me, man?

1:32:04.666 --> 1:32:07.083
Are y'all fuckin' crazy?
We're not gonna win this war,

1:32:07.166 --> 1:32:10.250
so we gotta do somethin' big
and we gotta do it now!

1:32:13.708 --> 1:32:15.916
You out your mind?

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.666
Man, "complete satisfaction,"
ain't that what the fuck
you told me?

1:32:18.750 --> 1:32:20.375
"Kill 'em all,
complete satisfaction."

1:32:20.458 --> 1:32:22.333
But I didn't mean it like that.

1:32:22.416 --> 1:32:24.291
-I did not mean it like that.
-I call you "comrade"
'cause we at war!

1:32:24.375 --> 1:32:26.625
You're the one
that gave me the game, man!

1:32:26.708 --> 1:32:29.250
Know Jimmy Palmer?

1:32:29.333 --> 1:32:32.250
All right,
you remember Little Bobby?

1:32:32.333 --> 1:32:34.625
Franko Diggs? Thomas Lewis?

1:32:34.708 --> 1:32:37.750
Bunchy Carter? Jake Winters?

1:32:40.041 --> 1:32:43.125
All you lookin' to do
is add more names to that list.

1:32:43.208 --> 1:32:46.041
You bomb city hall,
they gonna bomb us.

1:32:49.125 --> 1:32:51.458
I'm ready to die
for the people, Chairman.

1:32:51.541 --> 1:32:52.958
How about you?

1:32:55.375 --> 1:32:57.416
Is it a goddamn revolution
or what?

1:32:58.208 --> 1:32:59.416
Huh?

1:32:59.500 --> 1:33:00.541
[Fred] Get this shit
the fuck outta here!

1:33:00.625 --> 1:33:01.791
Why the fuck is we doin' it?

1:33:01.875 --> 1:33:03.625
What are we
doin' this shit for?

1:33:03.708 --> 1:33:05.333
[Fred] Get this shit
the fuck outta here,
you fuckin' idiot!

1:33:07.416 --> 1:33:09.666
-Get the fuck on, man!
-Go!

1:33:12.375 --> 1:33:14.166
Well, then fuck it, then!
I'm out!

1:33:14.250 --> 1:33:16.750
This whole shit gonna crumble!

1:33:16.833 --> 1:33:18.583
Motherfucker!

1:33:20.666 --> 1:33:22.083
Fuck is you talkin' about,
nigga?

1:33:22.166 --> 1:33:23.333
[engine starts]

1:33:24.166 --> 1:33:25.208
[engine revs]

1:33:28.541 --> 1:33:32.041
[grunts, breathes heavily]

1:33:33.541 --> 1:33:35.333
God damn it!

1:33:37.250 --> 1:33:38.708
Shit.

1:33:41.875 --> 1:33:44.500
[tense music playing]

1:34:02.250 --> 1:34:05.000
[woman on phone]<i> FBI,</i>
<i>how may I direct your call?</i>

1:34:05.083 --> 1:34:08.416
Uh, Special Agent Carlyle
for Director Hoover.

1:34:09.208 --> 1:34:10.791
[line beeping]

1:34:13.583 --> 1:34:14.708
[Hoover]<i> Hello.</i>

1:34:14.791 --> 1:34:17.333
Director Hoover,
good afternoon, sir.

1:34:17.416 --> 1:34:21.250
I am calling with good news.
With great news.

1:34:21.333 --> 1:34:22.666
Two hours ago,

1:34:22.750 --> 1:34:25.750
the Illinois Supreme Court
denied Hampton's appeal.

1:34:25.833 --> 1:34:28.333
He's going back to Menard.

1:34:28.416 --> 1:34:30.000
<i>I know.</i>

1:34:33.875 --> 1:34:36.500
Well, that's what we wanted,
right?

1:34:38.625 --> 1:34:42.833
<i>Prison made Huey Newton</i>
<i>a celebrity.</i>

1:34:42.916 --> 1:34:46.541
<i>It made Eldridge Cleaver</i>
<i>a best-selling author.</i>

1:34:48.166 --> 1:34:51.500
<i>Prison is a temporary solution.</i>

1:34:55.875 --> 1:34:57.875
[footsteps approaching]

1:34:57.958 --> 1:34:59.375
[Deborah] What you doing?

1:34:59.458 --> 1:35:01.750
[Fred] Goin' through old shit.

1:35:11.416 --> 1:35:14.250
My mom used to babysit him,
you know?

1:35:14.333 --> 1:35:15.791
Not all the time,

1:35:15.875 --> 1:35:17.333
but his family lived
across the street,

1:35:17.416 --> 1:35:20.958
so every now and then,
she'd watch him.

1:35:21.041 --> 1:35:25.291
We didn't go to the funeral.
It was too much for her.

1:35:25.375 --> 1:35:28.583
I don't even think
I saw the photo
till months later.

1:35:29.625 --> 1:35:32.500
But I remember when I did.

1:35:32.583 --> 1:35:37.041
Thinkin',
"There's people in this world
who want to do that to me?

1:35:37.125 --> 1:35:38.125
Or my brother?

1:35:39.791 --> 1:35:41.416
Or my sister?"

1:35:43.500 --> 1:35:47.125
That's when I knew
I had to protect 'em.

1:35:47.208 --> 1:35:50.583
I mean, looking at that photo,
how could you
not feel that way?

1:35:55.750 --> 1:35:57.791
Now, here I am. [scoffs]

1:35:59.666 --> 1:36:02.000
About to go back to Menard.

1:36:03.750 --> 1:36:06.458
Where I won't be able
to protect anybody.

1:36:07.625 --> 1:36:09.708
Not even my own son.

1:36:12.708 --> 1:36:14.791
The party will protect him.

1:36:15.958 --> 1:36:18.166
You hear me?

1:36:18.250 --> 1:36:20.458
The people will protect him.

1:36:37.291 --> 1:36:40.250
[soft piano music playing]

1:36:40.333 --> 1:36:41.666
[Bill] Here, take this.

1:36:41.750 --> 1:36:43.083
Yes, sir.

1:36:43.791 --> 1:36:46.875
Hey. Roy boy.

1:36:47.458 --> 1:36:49.541
How are you?

1:36:49.625 --> 1:36:53.875
Look, man, sorry I'm late.
I just, you know...

1:36:53.958 --> 1:36:55.708
How's it goin'?

1:36:56.875 --> 1:36:57.958
[Bill chuckles]

1:36:58.041 --> 1:37:00.000
It's groovy, right?

1:37:10.291 --> 1:37:12.583
What can I do for you, Roy?

1:37:13.958 --> 1:37:17.041
You've been
to Hampton's apartment, right?

1:37:17.125 --> 1:37:18.041
Right.

1:37:18.125 --> 1:37:19.916
A lot of guns there?

1:37:20.041 --> 1:37:22.625
Of course.

1:37:22.708 --> 1:37:26.333
Good. I need you to draw me
a blueprint of the place.

1:37:28.833 --> 1:37:30.583
Uh, you must not...

1:37:30.666 --> 1:37:33.083
Fred's goin' back
to Menard, man.

1:37:33.166 --> 1:37:36.500
Uh, I think it was
his appeal getting revoked
or somethin' like that.

1:37:36.583 --> 1:37:38.250
No, I'm aware.

1:37:38.333 --> 1:37:43.333
All right, well,
if you're aware, then, um,
I don't understand.

1:37:45.666 --> 1:37:48.083
You don't have
to understand, Bill.

1:37:48.166 --> 1:37:50.833
You just have to draw me
that blueprint.

1:37:53.208 --> 1:37:54.583
[laughs]

1:38:03.166 --> 1:38:04.958
-Listen, Roy.
-Uh-huh.

1:38:06.916 --> 1:38:09.791
You got him, man.
You know, you won.

1:38:09.875 --> 1:38:11.166
Fred's...

1:38:12.958 --> 1:38:15.041
What more do you want?

1:38:17.416 --> 1:38:18.750
[Roy sighs]

1:38:23.166 --> 1:38:25.333
Are you gonna kill him, Roy?

1:38:27.791 --> 1:38:28.875
Huh?

1:38:41.208 --> 1:38:44.500
I saw you, you know.

1:38:46.416 --> 1:38:47.708
What?

1:38:48.541 --> 1:38:50.875
That day at the speech.

1:38:50.958 --> 1:38:52.916
I watched you.

1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:57.583
I remember thinking to myself,
"Either this guy

1:38:57.666 --> 1:39:01.666
deserves an Academy Award,

1:39:01.750 --> 1:39:03.750
or he really
believes this shit."

1:39:03.833 --> 1:39:06.541
Hey, come on, man, now,
I was doin' my goddamn...

1:39:06.625 --> 1:39:08.375
I was doin' the job
that you told me to do.

1:39:08.458 --> 1:39:10.250
I was doin'
what the fuck you said.

1:39:10.333 --> 1:39:11.875
-The fuck
are you talkin' about, man?
-Tell you what, though.

1:39:11.958 --> 1:39:14.666
Let's say I put a call
in to New Haven PD,

1:39:14.750 --> 1:39:19.166
get 'em to send me
a few snapshots
of your friend,

1:39:19.250 --> 1:39:20.916
Alex Rackley,

1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.041
after they dragged him
from the river,

1:39:23.125 --> 1:39:25.416
cigarette burns
all over his body,

1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:27.666
skin peeling off,

1:39:27.750 --> 1:39:31.375
where the Panthers
poured boiling water
all over his cock.

1:39:38.083 --> 1:39:40.375
If they did that to Rackley,

1:39:40.458 --> 1:39:42.625
imagine what they'll do

1:39:42.708 --> 1:39:46.791
when they find out
their security captain
is a fucking rat.

1:39:49.875 --> 1:39:52.166
A fucking rat.

1:40:09.541 --> 1:40:11.083
Fuck, Roy.

1:40:24.083 --> 1:40:26.500
[Wayne]<i> They name</i>
<i>all these ships, like</i> Apollo
<i>and all that, right,</i>

1:40:26.583 --> 1:40:29.208
<i>after Black people,</i>
<i>but ain't no Black astronauts,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1:40:29.291 --> 1:40:30.416
[both chuckle]

1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:32.666
Well, I like seein' you smile.

1:40:33.750 --> 1:40:36.791
How about we continue this
at my pad?

1:40:36.875 --> 1:40:38.708
Have a nightcap.

1:40:38.791 --> 1:40:40.291
[woman chuckles]

1:40:40.375 --> 1:40:43.041
I got more than enough alcohol,
you know?

1:40:43.833 --> 1:40:45.208
All right.

1:40:47.833 --> 1:40:49.000
Hi.

1:40:50.666 --> 1:40:51.833
I'm Darlene.

1:40:51.916 --> 1:40:56.000
Hey. [clears throat] Bill.

1:40:56.083 --> 1:40:59.333
What brings you out
so late, Bill?

1:40:59.416 --> 1:41:03.541
You know, it's quiet.
Nobody know who the hell I am.

1:41:03.625 --> 1:41:04.916
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.875
Mysterious.

1:41:08.458 --> 1:41:12.416
So, what do you do,
Mystery Man?

1:41:12.500 --> 1:41:13.666
Um... [clears throat]

1:41:13.750 --> 1:41:16.500
-I used to work for the FBI.
-[laughs]

1:41:21.875 --> 1:41:27.041
Top me off
while I run to the ladies',
Eliot Ness.

1:41:28.208 --> 1:41:30.166
[Darlene chuckles]

1:41:33.333 --> 1:41:34.875
Shit. [chuckles]

1:41:36.083 --> 1:41:39.916
They let niggas
work for the FBI now?

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.583
Is that right?
Why don't you get me
an application, brother?

1:41:42.666 --> 1:41:43.791
Mr. FBI man, huh?

1:41:43.875 --> 1:41:45.458
Hey, man.
Would you shut the fuck up?

1:41:45.541 --> 1:41:47.791
-Hey, hey, hey!
-God damn it.

1:41:47.875 --> 1:41:50.000
Mitchell warned me about you.

1:41:50.583 --> 1:41:52.291
What?

1:41:52.375 --> 1:41:54.083
Yeah.

1:41:54.166 --> 1:41:55.541
What?

1:41:58.500 --> 1:42:00.291
Look here, just relax.

1:42:00.375 --> 1:42:04.500
Okay, we hidin' in plain sight.
Nobody know we in here.

1:42:04.583 --> 1:42:08.041
Check this out, man.
I got this article
I want you to read right here.

1:42:08.125 --> 1:42:12.208
Yeah, right, it's the article
in this paper. Very important.

1:42:12.291 --> 1:42:14.916
I need you to let the Chairman
read it tomorrow night.

1:42:20.541 --> 1:42:22.500
And put that in his drink.

1:42:23.333 --> 1:42:24.958
[breath trembles]

1:42:25.625 --> 1:42:27.291
[scoffs]

1:42:27.375 --> 1:42:29.250
I don't know what the fuck
you talkin' about, man.
I don't...

1:42:29.333 --> 1:42:31.583
Fuck outta here with that shit.

1:42:33.750 --> 1:42:35.208
-[man] My mistake.
-All articles and shit, man.

1:42:35.291 --> 1:42:37.708
No, no, it's all good,
that's my mistake.

1:42:37.791 --> 1:42:40.458
No, I guess I had
the wrong guy.

1:42:40.541 --> 1:42:42.333
Sorry about that.

1:42:43.291 --> 1:42:45.125
Lemme get outta here.

1:43:04.041 --> 1:43:06.250
[breathing heavily]

1:43:07.291 --> 1:43:10.083
[Bill] Hey! Hey!

1:43:10.166 --> 1:43:11.875
Who are you, man?

1:43:11.958 --> 1:43:14.083
[man] Hey,
don't worry about it, slick.
Man, just go back inside.

1:43:14.166 --> 1:43:17.875
[Bill] Nigga,
I'm not gonna poison him,
you hear me?

1:43:17.958 --> 1:43:19.958
-You fuckin' hear me?
-[laughing]

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.166
Come on, man,
you watch too many movies.

1:43:24.250 --> 1:43:26.666
Look, all it's gonna do
is just make him sleepy.

1:43:26.750 --> 1:43:28.250
You want him to go easy, right?

1:43:28.333 --> 1:43:30.750
Who the fuck are you, man?
Tell me your fuckin' name!

1:43:30.833 --> 1:43:33.083
You know... Did Roy send you?

1:43:33.166 --> 1:43:36.458
If you a Fed,
then show me a fuckin' badge!

1:43:36.541 --> 1:43:40.791
Hey! Show me
a fuckin' badge, man!
Please!

1:43:56.875 --> 1:43:59.750
[strident jazz music playing]

1:44:08.708 --> 1:44:10.041
[sniffles]

1:44:13.958 --> 1:44:14.958
Shit.

1:44:22.458 --> 1:44:24.625
[Collins]
Consider that a gift...

1:44:25.666 --> 1:44:27.416
from the Crowns.

1:44:32.541 --> 1:44:35.458
Ain't no shame in runnin'.

1:44:35.541 --> 1:44:37.291
It's not like
they giving you a choice.

1:44:37.375 --> 1:44:40.666
Yeah, maybe he's right,
Chairman.

1:44:40.750 --> 1:44:42.416
Go overseas.

1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:48.125
Like you said,
start an international
proletariat revolution.

1:44:48.208 --> 1:44:50.875
At least that way,
you're still in the fight.

1:44:53.458 --> 1:44:56.125
[breathing shakily]

1:44:59.958 --> 1:45:01.708
[Collins] So, what about Cuba?

1:45:02.375 --> 1:45:03.791
[Tracy] Nuh-uh.

1:45:04.958 --> 1:45:07.416
[Collins] Cuba's not an option?
Why not?

1:45:07.500 --> 1:45:08.541
[Tracy] Algeria.

1:45:08.625 --> 1:45:09.916
[Collins] Shit.

1:45:17.250 --> 1:45:22.500
Mark Clark,
Deputy Minister of Defense,
Peoria chapter.

1:45:23.041 --> 1:45:24.625
[sighs]

1:45:27.375 --> 1:45:29.041
Central ordered me
to come down here

1:45:29.125 --> 1:45:32.125
to check out
how y'all do things,

1:45:32.208 --> 1:45:33.958
here in the Windy City.

1:45:34.041 --> 1:45:35.583
Yeah.

1:45:35.666 --> 1:45:38.291
And your name, comrade?

1:45:38.375 --> 1:45:39.291
Bill.

1:45:39.375 --> 1:45:40.750
-[Clark] Bill?
-Mm-hmm.

1:45:40.833 --> 1:45:42.833
[Clark] Bill.
What cadre are you in, Bill?

1:45:42.916 --> 1:45:45.708
Man, I'm not even in no...

1:45:45.791 --> 1:45:47.583
Thinking about joining up?

1:45:47.666 --> 1:45:50.708
Right on. Right on, Bill.

1:45:50.791 --> 1:45:53.625
You know, I started off
in the NAACP myself.

1:45:53.708 --> 1:45:55.166
Then I had to leave.

1:45:55.250 --> 1:45:57.083
Them Negroes
move too damn slow for me.

1:45:57.166 --> 1:45:58.250
[Compton] I know a guy.

1:45:58.333 --> 1:45:59.916
Kites up checks, passports,

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:01.958
driver's licenses,
things of that nature.

1:46:02.041 --> 1:46:05.583
Yeah, but how far we gonna get
when one of us
is 37 weeks pregnant?

1:46:05.666 --> 1:46:07.750
You could be in Havana
in less than 24 hours.

1:46:07.833 --> 1:46:09.583
And they have some of
the best doctors in the world.

1:46:09.666 --> 1:46:11.583
[Tracy]
Yeah, okay, let's just hope
that's not the day

1:46:11.666 --> 1:46:14.250
that Nixon decides
to nuke that motherfucker.

1:46:14.333 --> 1:46:17.958
Look, Algeria,
they got Minister Eldridge.

1:46:18.041 --> 1:46:20.000
Not to mention bungalows
by the sea.

1:46:20.083 --> 1:46:21.583
[Doc Satchel] But the Cubans
got ocean for days.

1:46:21.666 --> 1:46:23.958
You know how long it'll take
to get to Algeria?

1:46:24.041 --> 1:46:26.375
That Cuba's
a hop and a skip away.

1:46:26.458 --> 1:46:29.291
[Bobby] There is a network
of safe houses headin' south.

1:46:29.375 --> 1:46:31.291
I could put a call
into Central.

1:46:31.375 --> 1:46:34.208
Y'all spendin' all this time
talkin' about me
goin' to Algerian bungalows,

1:46:34.291 --> 1:46:35.958
when you need
to be talkin' about

1:46:36.041 --> 1:46:38.250
how we gonna build
this motherfuckin'
medical clinic.

1:46:38.333 --> 1:46:39.500
[sighs]

1:46:43.833 --> 1:46:46.541
Is the party about me
or is it about the people?

1:46:49.541 --> 1:46:50.500
Hmm?

1:47:00.916 --> 1:47:02.291
Chairman...

1:47:02.375 --> 1:47:04.500
It's a 5-year bid.

1:47:06.583 --> 1:47:10.166
You know how many people
we could save in five years?

1:47:10.250 --> 1:47:15.041
With a medical clinic
in the middle of the West Side?

1:47:21.250 --> 1:47:23.875
As far as I'm concerned,
that's an easy decision.

1:47:24.708 --> 1:47:25.833
Doc.

1:47:28.291 --> 1:47:29.916
You run it.

1:47:35.583 --> 1:47:37.833
Name it after Jake.

1:47:40.250 --> 1:47:42.833
So, when people hear
the name Jake Winters,

1:47:44.625 --> 1:47:46.833
they think about healin'.

1:47:48.333 --> 1:47:49.458
And lovin'.

1:47:51.416 --> 1:47:53.375
Like he loved us.

1:48:00.208 --> 1:48:02.625
And when I get out,

1:48:06.458 --> 1:48:09.250
me and Deb can have our second.

1:48:09.333 --> 1:48:10.708
[Deborah chuckles]

1:48:14.875 --> 1:48:16.958
And third,

1:48:18.416 --> 1:48:21.000
-and fourth...
-Okay. Easy now.

1:48:21.083 --> 1:48:23.416
I was gonna cap it
at five, baby.
Five's a good number, right?

1:48:23.500 --> 1:48:25.500
How 'bout we see how you do
with the one?

1:48:25.583 --> 1:48:26.875
[Fred] Mm-hmm.

1:48:28.333 --> 1:48:29.708
[Fred sighs]

1:48:32.625 --> 1:48:36.833
Speaking of children, Chairman,
I'm gonna go
and get back to my family.

1:48:36.916 --> 1:48:38.083
[Fred] Take care, comrade.

1:48:38.166 --> 1:48:40.666
All right.
See you in the morning.

1:48:40.750 --> 1:48:41.958
Comrade.

1:48:54.041 --> 1:48:57.208
Right. Come on, baby, you eat.

1:48:57.291 --> 1:48:59.625
Come on.
This'll get you strong.

1:48:59.708 --> 1:49:01.000
[Deborah groans]

1:49:01.083 --> 1:49:02.500
-This'll raise the blood.
-That's way too much.

1:49:02.583 --> 1:49:03.916
Oh, what? What?

1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:05.666
[chuckles] That's too much.

1:49:07.833 --> 1:49:09.291
What's up?

1:49:12.666 --> 1:49:14.750
[gulps]

1:49:14.833 --> 1:49:17.250
I thought I'd get
another drink.

1:49:18.458 --> 1:49:20.666
You want a refill, Chairman?

1:49:49.583 --> 1:49:52.250
[breathes shakily]

1:49:53.583 --> 1:49:55.000
[clears throat]

1:50:01.250 --> 1:50:02.833
[engine starts]

1:50:13.083 --> 1:50:15.041
[lighter clicking]

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.625
[door opens outside]

1:50:31.500 --> 1:50:32.750
[door closes]

1:50:44.208 --> 1:50:46.625
[muffled footsteps]

1:50:53.541 --> 1:50:56.708
[whispering] Hey. Hey. Wake up.

1:50:58.291 --> 1:50:59.791
Look.

1:51:04.625 --> 1:51:06.541
[switch clicks]

1:51:06.625 --> 1:51:08.583
-[whispering] Hey. Hey.
-[fingers snap]

1:51:08.666 --> 1:51:10.125
-[inhales sharply]
-Wake up.

1:51:10.208 --> 1:51:11.083
[grunts softly]

1:51:11.166 --> 1:51:12.708
Somebody at the door.

1:51:12.791 --> 1:51:14.750
[whispering] Hey, Tracy.

1:51:16.333 --> 1:51:18.208
I'mma wake the Chairman.

1:51:23.083 --> 1:51:24.708
[knocking on door]

1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.083
I'm comin'!

1:51:32.166 --> 1:51:33.333
[gunshots]

1:51:33.416 --> 1:51:34.833
[Officer Blart]
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1:51:34.916 --> 1:51:37.416
[Herman] Deb, get down!
Get down! Get down!

1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:40.291
[men clamoring]

1:51:40.375 --> 1:51:41.541
No! No!

1:51:41.625 --> 1:51:44.083
-[automatic gunfire]
-[men groaning]

1:51:49.166 --> 1:51:50.333
[Deborah] Chairman!

1:51:50.416 --> 1:51:51.875
[gunshots]

1:51:51.958 --> 1:51:54.250
Chairman, wake up!

1:51:54.333 --> 1:51:55.625
Wake up! Chairman!

1:51:55.708 --> 1:51:58.333
Chairman! Chairman! Wake up!

1:51:58.416 --> 1:51:59.458
Chairman, wake up!

1:51:59.541 --> 1:52:02.250
Wake up! Wake up! Chairman!

1:52:02.333 --> 1:52:04.458
[Officer Caple]
Turn on the fucking lights!

1:52:04.541 --> 1:52:06.208
[Doc Satchel] We can't!
We've been shot!

1:52:06.291 --> 1:52:09.625
[Officer Caple]
Turn on the light
or you'll get shot more!

1:52:09.708 --> 1:52:12.166
[all whimpering quietly]

1:52:12.250 --> 1:52:14.000
[coughing]

1:52:14.083 --> 1:52:16.208
[all groaning]

1:52:23.333 --> 1:52:24.833
[Doc Satchel] Come on, come on!

1:52:25.750 --> 1:52:28.666
Betty... Get up. Get up.

1:52:28.750 --> 1:52:30.250
[all grunting]

1:52:41.416 --> 1:52:42.708
[Doc Satchel groans]

1:52:42.791 --> 1:52:44.750
[Herman] We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1:52:44.833 --> 1:52:46.833
Come here! Come here!

1:52:46.916 --> 1:52:48.333
[groaning]

1:52:48.416 --> 1:52:50.125
[officer]
How many are in there?

1:52:50.208 --> 1:52:51.958
[Compton] Just stop shootin'!
Stop shootin'!

1:52:52.041 --> 1:52:54.166
We got a pregnant sister
in here, God damn it!

1:52:54.250 --> 1:52:56.541
[Officer Blart]
Everyone out! Now!

1:52:56.625 --> 1:52:59.541
[Deborah whimpering]

1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:05.541
I said now!

1:53:16.083 --> 1:53:18.458
[Officer Maroney]
Get over here!

1:53:18.541 --> 1:53:20.750
[Officer Blart]
Keep those hands up!

1:53:27.208 --> 1:53:28.541
[sniffles]

1:53:34.958 --> 1:53:37.458
