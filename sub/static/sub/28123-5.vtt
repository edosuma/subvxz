Live to breathe another day.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.430
[Yvie] Mercedes went home.

01:57.430 --> 01:59.170
I'm a little heartbroken
to see her go,

01:59.170 --> 02:00.400
because she is a sweetheart,

02:00.400 --> 02:03.140
but she wasn't
a strong contender,

02:03.140 --> 02:05.340

02:17.150 --> 02:20.590
my strategy is just
to project positive energy,

02:20.590 --> 02:24.190
because I always go to
the negative in any situation.

02:24.190 --> 02:27.130
My God, give me a piece
of this couch. Ooh!

02:27.130 --> 02:30.070
[Nina] Big silk, looks like
the milk is good.

02:30.070 --> 02:31.100
Congratulations, mama.

-Congrats, girl.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.540
-Well deserved, all right!
-Yeah.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.740
[Scarlet] I feel
like we all shined,

02:36.740 --> 02:38.570
and I got the validation
I needed

02:38.570 --> 02:41.540
with Ru's comment to me about
like how well it was casted.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.210
And I feel totally fine with it.

02:44.210 --> 02:48.580
[Scarlet] Ru made it a point
to let me know I did a good job.

02:48.580 --> 02:51.720
So, yes,
as the casting director,

02:51.720 --> 02:55.120
I'm going to bask in the glory
that is that sunshine.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.260
[Ariel] Girl, delusions.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.600
Every time Scarlet speaks,
it's a giant eye roll.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.370
It's not like she was giving us
the directions.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.000
We all did the damn thing, and
it had nothing to do with her.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.570
[Silky] I just wanted to send
all of you an invitation

03:09.570 --> 03:11.510
to come we havin' a girls' trip.

03:11.510 --> 03:13.480
But you have to leave
your man at home.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.550

Brooke Lynn and Vangie?

03:15.550 --> 03:17.550

03:17.550 --> 03:20.120
You know, I've been noticing
here lately, you know,

03:20.120 --> 03:22.520
a lot of chemistry
between you and Brooke Lynn.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.550
What exactly is going on?

03:24.550 --> 03:26.290
Brooke Lynn's
a good friend of mine.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.160
-A really good friend.
-[laughs]

03:28.160 --> 03:29.490
We have a crush on each other.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.460
Me and Vanjie have a crush
on each other,

03:31.460 --> 03:32.660
and we'll see where it goes.

03:32.660 --> 03:35.130
[giggles]

03:35.130 --> 03:36.430
I think Vanjie's really cute,

03:36.430 --> 03:39.140
and we're just getting
to know each other.

03:39.140 --> 03:42.170
[Vanjie] It's real fresh,
out the womb.

03:42.170 --> 03:43.770
You know,
I'm going with the flow.

03:43.770 --> 03:46.740
If those kisses keep coming,
I'm gonna keep accepting.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.550
Yes!
[cheering]

03:49.550 --> 03:52.380
If you know what I'm saying.

Thank God I came back to that.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.750
[all laugh]

03:55.750 --> 03:57.520
This bitch
ain't fucking going home,

03:57.520 --> 03:59.220
not when my jush is here.

03:59.220 --> 04:01.320
[all laugh]

04:01.320 --> 04:03.490
I'm grateful to be here
for another week.

04:03.490 --> 04:06.000
I'm glad I didn't have
to fucking lip sync, girl.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.500
But if I have to do that shit
every fucking week,

04:08.500 --> 04:11.770
if that's how I have to fight
to stay here, I will do it.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.770
Because I feel
the most comfortable

04:13.770 --> 04:18.070
when I am on stage
living and getting my jush.

04:18.070 --> 04:19.640
Yeah, girl, but when
are you going to apply that

04:19.640 --> 04:21.140
to the challenges, because
that's what's going to keep you

04:21.140 --> 04:22.150
out of the bottom.

04:22.150 --> 04:23.580
Now, I will tell you this.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.310
Don't try me right now.

04:25.310 --> 04:26.120
That's not trying you, girl.
That's being honest.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.250
No, but no, no, no, no, no.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.380
That's the Tee, girl.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.420
You better take
that tone back down.

04:29.420 --> 04:32.050

my least favorite thing

04:32.050 --> 04:34.220
to ever hear on this show,

04:34.220 --> 04:36.390
which is, well,
I'll lip sync every week

04:36.390 --> 04:38.590
if that means I'm going
to get my way there.

04:38.590 --> 04:40.130
And I'm just like, girl,

04:40.130 --> 04:42.630
even if you pack every
other girl up this season,

04:42.630 --> 04:45.300
do you really think Ru's
gonna put the crown on your head

04:45.300 --> 04:47.240
if you're not delivering
in the challenges?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.810

You are literally
wearing trash.

I mean, I'm gagging from like...
[sniffs] the smell.

05:02.020 --> 05:05.190
It's like bitch do you bathe?

05:05.190 --> 05:08.090
What I'm saying is
what I have to do

05:08.090 --> 05:10.460
is silence all of these demons,

05:10.460 --> 05:14.560
all of this extra
outside/inside noise,

05:14.560 --> 05:18.070
and prove who I am by
continuing to be true to myself.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.740

Ra'Jah feels very attacked by
me

because it's the truth.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.640
[Yvie] I just don't like it

05:27.640 --> 05:31.180
if a bitch is not going to like
actually learn a lesson,

05:31.180 --> 05:33.580
especially if you keep giving
the bullshit excuses

05:33.580 --> 05:35.120
of like, oh, well, I'll try
harder next time, girl.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.290

10:09.020 --> 10:10.730
is vaguely familiar.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.290
Have you been to Cameroon?

10:12.290 --> 10:13.630
[RuPaul laughs]

10:13.630 --> 10:16.230
[RuPaul] Meet Sticky
Finger Silky.

10:16.230 --> 10:19.740
A lot of dolls drive
fancy pink sports cars,

10:19.740 --> 10:22.040
but she drives
a doughnut truck.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.240
Her box is stuffed
with all kinds

10:24.240 --> 10:26.180
of fun-to-play-with
accessories,

10:26.180 --> 10:29.250
like bootleg CDs and chips.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.280
Dips not included.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.120
Uranium Yvie.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.320
Kids love to play with her

10:35.320 --> 10:38.250
because they can shave
her periodic table

10:38.250 --> 10:40.060
and watch the hair grow back.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.620
[Trixie laughs]

10:41.620 --> 10:43.130
[Trixie] Meet Awesome Ariel.

10:43.130 --> 10:45.460
She's full of surprises.

10:45.460 --> 10:48.260
When you pull her string,
she swallows.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.100
Awesome Ariel
can't move her face,

10:50.100 --> 10:52.130
but she can bend her neck,
her back,

10:52.130 --> 10:55.000
from her pussy to her crack.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.470
[RuPaul] Meet Stupid Scarlet.

10:57.470 --> 10:59.340
She lives
in a state of judgment,

10:59.340 --> 11:00.680
because she loves to hate.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.350
[Trixie]
Cheap wig and a pink dress.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.750
A woman after my own heart.
[RuPaul laughs]

11:05.750 --> 11:08.550
[Trixie] Meet
Starr-Keisha Booty La'RaJah.

11:08.550 --> 11:10.450
She might have smaller feet
than RuPaul,

11:10.450 --> 11:12.720
but her badonkadonk
is enormous.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.520
Her box is stuffed

11:14.520 --> 11:16.290
with all kinds of
fun-to-play-with accessories,

11:16.290 --> 11:18.630
like an extra-large cup
of drank.

11:18.630 --> 11:20.360
[RuPaul laughs]

11:20.360 --> 11:22.670
A lot of dolls drive
fancy pink sports cars,

11:22.670 --> 11:25.100
but she drives a bus.

11:25.100 --> 11:29.040
She's not just a doll,
she's a bad bitch.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.270
Meet Bachelorette Brandy.

11:31.270 --> 11:34.040
Her favorite hobbies
are cocktails,

11:34.040 --> 11:35.540
peeing behind dumpsters,

11:35.540 --> 11:37.810
and telling everyone
she's getting married.

11:37.810 --> 11:38.810
I know that girl.

11:38.810 --> 11:40.520
She's always a hit at parties,

11:40.520 --> 11:42.720
because her hips
are double jointed.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.090
Oh, Katya's here.

11:44.090 --> 11:45.350
[RuPaul laughs]

11:45.350 --> 11:47.460
[RuPaul] Meet Miss Vangie.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.560
Trixie, I'm coming
for your gig, girl.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.330
I do have a broken suitcase.

11:51.330 --> 11:54.160
[RuPaul] Vanessa Mateo
is attending night school

11:54.160 --> 11:56.330
at the University of Hookin'

11:56.330 --> 11:58.570
to get her degree
in stripperology.

11:58.570 --> 12:00.770
Whoo. Oh.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.240
[laughs]

12:04.240 --> 12:05.510
Did y'all get it?
[RuPaul laughs]

12:05.510 --> 12:07.310
[RuPaul] She's not just a doll,

12:07.310 --> 12:09.680
she's a Miss Vanjie.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.410
[Trixie] Meet A'Keria.

12:11.410 --> 12:14.080
Her friends call her
inmate 304.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.420
When you pull her string,

12:16.420 --> 12:19.150
she pulls a blade
from under her wig.

12:19.150 --> 12:21.690
You know, in prison
she's armed and dangerous.

12:21.690 --> 12:24.290
-Well, one-armed.
-One-armed and dangerous.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.660
[RuPaul laughs]

12:26.660 --> 12:28.260
[RuPaul] Nice work, dolls.

12:28.260 --> 12:31.800
But one of you really
melted my plastic heart.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.740
[all laugh]

12:33.740 --> 12:37.610
The winner of today's
Mini Challenge is...

12:37.610 --> 12:39.440
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.040
[cheers and applause]

12:42.040 --> 12:43.810
Yes!

12:43.810 --> 12:46.520
You've won
a $1.000 gift card

12:46.520 --> 12:49.220
from Coolhaus Ice Cream.

12:49.220 --> 12:51.050
-I'll take it.
-Ooh.

12:51.050 --> 12:53.190
Trixie, thank you
for playing today.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.660
Do you have any parting words
for my girls?

12:55.660 --> 12:58.690
Winning isn't everything,
but it's super fucking awesome.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.130
[all laugh]

13:00.130 --> 13:02.700
-Byeee!
-Byeee.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.330
The helicopters are circling.
I gotta go.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.700
[all laugh]

13:06.700 --> 13:09.440
Ladies, you know what
a drag queen calls Halloween?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.510
What?

13:10.510 --> 13:11.570
Amateur night.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.040
[all laugh]

13:13.040 --> 13:14.510
[RuPaul] That's right.

13:14.510 --> 13:18.050
It is time for you to show
the children how it's done.

13:18.050 --> 13:22.620
For this week's Maxi Challenge,
baby, we are throwing us a ball.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.690
[cheers and applause]

13:25.690 --> 13:28.320
But not just
any old ball, darling.

13:28.320 --> 13:33.030
We are throwing
a Monster Ball.

13:33.030 --> 13:34.660
[cheering]

13:34.660 --> 13:36.730
#DragRace.

13:36.730 --> 13:39.270
Now, you need to scare up
three lurks.

13:39.270 --> 13:42.710
First lurk,
Trampy Trick or Treater.

13:42.710 --> 13:44.470
You know, like, Naughty Nurse

13:44.470 --> 13:48.180
or Dirty Doctor
or Sexy Soccer Mom.

13:48.180 --> 13:49.210
[all laugh]

13:49.210 --> 13:52.250
Second look, Witch, Please.

13:52.250 --> 13:56.320
You know, like broomsticks,
bubbling cauldrons

13:56.320 --> 13:57.720
and things of that nature.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.990
And for your third lurk,

13:59.990 --> 14:02.390
you need to design and create

14:02.390 --> 14:06.330
a look that serves
both beauty and beast.

14:06.330 --> 14:09.000
[all laugh]

14:09.000 --> 14:11.770
Category is MILF Eleganza,

14:11.770 --> 14:16.510
as in Monsters I'd
Like to Freak.

14:16.510 --> 14:18.270
[cheers and applause]
Yas!

14:18.270 --> 14:22.280
For your MILF looks,
you can use these items here,

14:22.280 --> 14:27.120
plus materials
from the F&S Fabrics wall.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.490
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.450
All right?

14:32.450 --> 14:34.060
[all] All right.

14:34.060 --> 14:35.420
[applause]

14:39.330 --> 14:42.770
[Yvie] Our challenge today
is the Monster's Ball.

14:42.770 --> 14:46.170
Because it's a ball, you have
to serve in three categories.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.600
There's Trampy Trick
or Treater realness,

14:48.600 --> 14:52.370
Witch Please!,
and Monster I'd Like to Freak.

14:52.370 --> 14:55.380
What if I made the dress
out of this red pleather,

14:55.380 --> 14:57.310
because I got enough
to make a whole--a full dress.

14:57.310 --> 14:59.450
Right. What you wanna do?

14:59.450 --> 15:00.650
I don't know.
I'm a devil.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.380
What's a little devil wear,
honey?

15:02.380 --> 15:03.690
Prada.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.820
[all laugh]

15:07.590 --> 15:09.690
And see, like, bitch,
I can cut this fur off

15:09.690 --> 15:10.990
and put red on them.

15:10.990 --> 15:13.100
That looks like werewolf, no?

15:13.100 --> 15:14.630
-That's giving werewolf.
-Yeah.

15:14.630 --> 15:16.670
[Silky] In this competition,
there are cliques.

15:16.670 --> 15:19.570
I am closest to the dream girls,

15:19.570 --> 15:24.510
and the dream girls consist
of me, A'Keria, and Miss Vanjie.

15:24.510 --> 15:26.180
You're complicating it
more than what it--

15:26.180 --> 15:27.210
Yeah, you're making it hard.

15:27.210 --> 15:28.540
You're making it
real complicated.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.150
Do something that's gonna
make you look fierce.

15:31.150 --> 15:33.220
The dream girls are gonna
be the top three. Duh.

15:33.220 --> 15:34.420
I'm gonna do
this big mermaid bottom,

15:34.420 --> 15:35.680
'cause ain't nobody
gonna do that.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.320
Okay, bitch, I think I got it.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.220
[Yvie] With Silky,
the judges have been

15:41.220 --> 15:45.030
sort of lenient
on her style issues

15:45.030 --> 15:46.660
because of her personality.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.730
Which like isn't a bad thing,
but I don't think she gets

15:48.730 --> 15:51.630
she can't ride her
personality train to the end,

15:51.630 --> 15:55.170
especially in challenges
where she's not comfortable.

15:55.170 --> 15:56.370
Bitch.

15:56.370 --> 15:57.570
I have to remake this.

15:59.310 --> 16:01.040
I'm not too fond of Halloween.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.610
I'm not a spooky bitch.

16:02.610 --> 16:06.420
If you want to see me in a ball,
honey, just go for realness.

16:06.420 --> 16:10.050
So in this challenge,
I want to emphasize

16:10.050 --> 16:12.650
more on the freak part,
not really a monster.

16:12.650 --> 16:15.590
I just want to show that
there's more than spook to me,

16:15.590 --> 16:18.460
unlike some of the other ho's
in this competition.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.200
You watching, so you know
who the ho's are.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.660
I may be in the bottom
for this round,

16:22.660 --> 16:24.130
but I don't give a fuck.

16:24.130 --> 16:25.530
If I got to lip sync,
bitch, I got to lip sync.

16:25.530 --> 16:27.140
I'm ready.

16:27.140 --> 16:28.770
[Shuga] You look always ready
to lip sync, girl.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.070
That's the only one I know

16:30.070 --> 16:32.270
always want to lip sync.

16:32.270 --> 16:33.540
I'm gonna let y'all
have it, honey.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.240
Careful what you wish for, girl.

16:38.550 --> 16:40.280
How you doin' boo.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.580
Good.

16:41.580 --> 16:42.580
[Brooke Lynn] What kind of
monster are you?

16:42.580 --> 16:44.090
I drew it out here.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.490
[Brooke Lynn] Me and Vanjie,

16:45.490 --> 16:48.090
it's nice having
this thing happen.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.230
But this is work.
We're here for a competition.

16:50.230 --> 16:52.030
It's not personal,
it's drag.

16:52.030 --> 16:53.400
But I'm gonna do it longer.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.800
I was gonna do it short,
but I'm doing it longer.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.270
-Cute.
-I want to make it crystal clear

16:57.270 --> 16:59.770
that ain't no boy gonna
come between me and the crown.

16:59.770 --> 17:00.940
I'm focused.

17:05.010 --> 17:07.440
Hey, cysts.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.240
-Hi.
-Hey, Ru.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.110
How are
my little monsters doing?

17:11.110 --> 17:12.150
Killer.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.180
[all laugh]

17:14.180 --> 17:16.180
Nina West.

17:16.180 --> 17:17.420
Hi, Mr. Charles.

17:17.420 --> 17:18.650
Do you have
any favorite monsters?

17:18.650 --> 17:20.590
Bride of Frankenstein.

17:20.590 --> 17:22.390
Elsa Lanchester.

17:22.390 --> 17:24.660
[Nina] Elegant, gorgeous,
and still scary.

17:24.660 --> 17:26.460
-And iconic. Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.530
You know, she did an episode
of Murder She Wrote.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.070
Wait a minute. What episode
are you talking about?

17:30.070 --> 17:31.400
Was that her? No, I'm sorry.
I'm thinking...

17:31.400 --> 17:33.570
Baby, you do not want to test

17:33.570 --> 17:35.700
my Murder She Sat Down
and Wrote knowledge of that,

17:35.700 --> 17:37.340
because she was never on there.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.470
No, she wasn't,
because I confused--

17:38.470 --> 17:39.410
-But you know who was.
-Lillian Munster.

17:39.410 --> 17:41.710
-I confused her.
-Oh, yeah, Yvonne De Carlo.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.550
She played the cook on
the Jessica Behind Bars episode.

17:44.550 --> 17:46.550
Yeah, yeah, when she goes in and
talks to the women in prison.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.380
-Yes.
-I love that show.

17:48.380 --> 17:49.450
Is that what you're going to do,
Bride of Frankenstein?

17:49.450 --> 17:51.550
No, no, I'm going
more corpse bride,

17:51.550 --> 17:54.090
'cause she's
a little decomposing.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.790
I'm campy, I'm theatrical,

17:55.790 --> 17:59.030
and I really want to make sure
that that's part of this look.

17:59.030 --> 18:00.560
But still sexy.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.430
'Cause the idea is that we want
to fornicate with her.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.200
But there's some cobwebs
you have to clear away, but...

18:04.200 --> 18:05.400
-Oh.
-You want to dive right in.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
Story of my life.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
[laughs]

18:07.400 --> 18:09.070
Now, Nina,
if I remember correctly,

18:09.070 --> 18:10.210
you had an issue
with the design challenge.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.370
I did, I did.

18:11.370 --> 18:13.410
How are you going
to overcome that here?

18:13.410 --> 18:15.210
I'm going to tone down
all of the voices

18:15.210 --> 18:16.610
that make me want to go bigger,

18:16.610 --> 18:18.680
and focus on
delivering something

18:18.680 --> 18:20.320
that is within my ability.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.550
Oh, boy.
How many voices are in there?

18:22.550 --> 18:24.420
Girl, plenty.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.590
-Uh-huh.
-Plenty.

18:25.590 --> 18:28.190
Scares. All right,
I'll see you out there.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.090
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thanks, Nina.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.300
-Hi, Shuga Cain.
-Hi, Mama Ru.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.230
So now, have you won
any challenges?

18:36.230 --> 18:37.400
-I have not.
-Why is that?

18:37.400 --> 18:39.770
Maybe I'm not giving
as much as I should.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.740
So it's allowed me to kind of

18:41.740 --> 18:43.540
really think about
what I'm doing here,

18:43.540 --> 18:44.610
and look at the girls
who are winning stuff.

18:44.610 --> 18:45.640
Like, where is the difference?

18:45.640 --> 18:47.710
So there's definitely a fire.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.610
Now, your history with drag

18:49.610 --> 18:51.150
is that you had been
in the corporate world.

18:51.150 --> 18:52.480
Yeah.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.620
You quit all that
to do drag full time.

18:54.620 --> 18:57.590
Had you done drag before
you were in the corporate world?

18:57.590 --> 18:59.190
No. I mean,
I dabbled a little bit,

18:59.190 --> 19:00.960
and I just kind of--
I got the bug,

19:00.960 --> 19:03.960
and, you know, after trying to
pursue art for so many years,

19:03.960 --> 19:06.500
I finally was like
the cycle has to change.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.470
I can't be in a dead-end job
and just, you know,

19:10.470 --> 19:12.030
wishing I was doing
something that I love.

19:12.030 --> 19:13.270
And I'd saved some money,

19:13.270 --> 19:14.300
so I was like,
I'm just going to do it.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.970
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And see what happens.

19:15.970 --> 19:17.340
I was comfortable.

19:17.340 --> 19:19.010
I had that stable job
making six figures,

19:19.010 --> 19:20.980
and to just risk it all,

19:20.980 --> 19:22.140
there's no turning back for me.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.410
Like everything is on the line.

19:25.150 --> 19:26.350
Well, hello,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

19:26.350 --> 19:28.080
Hi, Ru.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.090
Where does your design aesthetic
come from?

19:30.090 --> 19:32.590
All over. I just know
what looks good on my body,

19:32.590 --> 19:34.660
and I know what I like to wear,
so I always start there.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.090
When did you find that out?

19:36.090 --> 19:38.730
Probably a couple years ago.

19:38.730 --> 19:40.500
-Just a couple years ago?
-Yeah.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.170
I only started sewing probably
about a year and a half ago.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.400
Yeah. And so
when I say sexy monster,

19:45.400 --> 19:47.040
what's the first thing
that comes to mind?

19:47.040 --> 19:49.340
I actually don't watch
a lot of scary movies,

19:49.340 --> 19:51.240
so the first thing
that came to my mind

19:51.240 --> 19:52.440
was I want to be
a sexy pageant queen.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.580
But I want to be a
first runner up who never wins.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.550
So she scalps
all the other winners

20:00.550 --> 20:01.980
and makes like her own crown
out of their heads.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.120
Okay.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.190
Okay.

20:08.190 --> 20:11.390
Giving that kind of like
very glassy RuPaul look.

20:11.390 --> 20:14.560
So, you know,
that's an interesting choice.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.260
[Brooke Lynn] It's one of those
things

20:16.260 --> 20:18.270
where you think something's
a really good idea,

20:18.270 --> 20:20.070
and then you start
verbalizing it to somebody,

20:20.070 --> 20:21.500
and you see their reaction.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.640
Okay, I need to do
something else.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.210
-Hi, Plastique.
-Hi, Ru.

20:29.210 --> 20:31.080
Now, you're a sewing bitch,
aren't you?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.480
You could say that.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.450
I really wanted to win
the first challenge.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.650
However, Brooke Lynn,
she took the cake.

20:36.650 --> 20:41.590
But I'm gonna make
this challenge my bitch, so...

20:41.590 --> 20:44.530
Okay. So when I say sexy
monster, what comes to mind?

20:44.530 --> 20:47.300
Like dark angel,
like, this dark lady.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.000
It's past the point of zombie.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.530
Now she's just a beautiful
spirit, just flowing around.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.030
But still looking for the D.

20:53.030 --> 20:54.700
Always and forever.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.270
[RuPaul] Okay, all right.

20:56.270 --> 20:58.110
But you know,
you're a pretty queen.

20:58.110 --> 20:59.110
Thank you.

20:59.110 --> 21:01.080
Can you do monster drag?

21:01.080 --> 21:03.350
Um, I haven't had
the opportunity

21:03.350 --> 21:05.350
to show y'all
that side of me yet,

21:05.350 --> 21:06.350
so I'm very excited.

21:06.350 --> 21:07.620
Yeah.

21:07.620 --> 21:09.320
[Silky] I ain't buying it,
honey.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.690
I just don't buy it.

21:10.690 --> 21:13.120
The bitch gonna give you pretty
all day, every day,

21:13.120 --> 21:15.760
in three fucking corsets.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.730
All right.
Can't wait to see what you do.

21:17.730 --> 21:18.790
Thank you.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.100
-Yvie Oddly.
-Hi, Ru.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.500
So, now, Yvie Oddly,
where does that come from?

21:25.500 --> 21:28.370
I had some other boring
who-gives-a-shit drag name,

21:28.370 --> 21:31.710
but people would say like
she just is so strange on stage.

21:31.710 --> 21:34.040
So I named myself Yvie Oddly,

21:34.040 --> 21:36.410
since I'm even odder
than everyone else, I guess.

21:36.410 --> 21:39.350
[RuPaul] How you gonna snatch
the trophy on this challenge?

21:39.350 --> 21:41.420
I'm gonna take a fashion element

21:41.420 --> 21:43.720
and combine it
with my unique perspective.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.760
I just wanna show that
I can also pull off some glam.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.460
-Uh-huh.
-[laughs]

21:48.460 --> 21:49.690
Is that what you're going to do
in this challenge?

21:49.690 --> 21:51.730
I mean, I'm actually going
to be a voodoo doll, so...

21:51.730 --> 21:53.160
Okay.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.500
She's going to be glamorous,

21:54.500 --> 21:57.430
but I still want to give
a little bit of a nod to my odd.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.370
Well, I can't wait
to see what you turn out.

21:59.370 --> 22:01.370
[Yvie] The girls
have already made it clear

22:01.370 --> 22:02.640
that they see me as a monster.

22:02.640 --> 22:06.310
The judges have seen a lot
with my monster drag.

22:06.310 --> 22:08.280
So I'm a little bit afraid

22:08.280 --> 22:11.550
that if I come out
as entirely monster,

22:11.550 --> 22:13.380
the judges are going
to read me for filth,

22:13.380 --> 22:15.520
and I don't want to be
predictable.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.720
I look across the room,
I see Ariel.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.360
And what she's making

22:23.360 --> 22:26.290
looks like something from Party
City, Little Mermaid section.

22:26.290 --> 22:27.800
I don't see no spook.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.200
How you gonna
make that scary, girl?

22:32.630 --> 22:34.370
And it has to be scary.

22:34.370 --> 22:36.540
Everyone's kind of like
I don't know if that's enough.

22:36.540 --> 22:38.070
You need to make that
like monster.

22:38.070 --> 22:40.240
But I still think that
I want to keep my mermaid

22:40.240 --> 22:42.740
a little bit more cutesy
so it's still true to me.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.310
I wish I had more
of that green tulle,

22:44.310 --> 22:45.480
'cause I don't want it
to look like

22:45.480 --> 22:47.050
I was like I got this
at Spirit Halloween.

22:47.050 --> 22:50.590
So I just need to do something
to it, bitch.

22:50.590 --> 22:51.790
[Plastique]
Yeah, you should.

22:51.790 --> 22:55.390
I'm telling you this
because I love you.

22:55.390 --> 22:56.830
-I know.
-[Plastique] Ariel's my girl.

22:56.830 --> 22:57.830
We've gotten really close.

22:57.830 --> 23:00.560
So I'm very worried about her.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.230
[Scarlet] Ariel lives
in a nineties

23:03.230 --> 23:05.370
Nickelodeon kind of place.

23:05.370 --> 23:08.540
I just don't know
if that's enough.

23:08.540 --> 23:11.310
There's not
very much variety so far.

23:11.310 --> 23:13.780
A similar wig,
a similar makeup.

23:13.780 --> 23:15.340
I'm just not sure
she can pull this off.

23:23.390 --> 23:24.690
What you making, ho?

23:24.690 --> 23:26.660
I'm doing, um...

23:26.660 --> 23:28.290
I heard something about
first runner up or something.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.500
[A'Keria]
So now what you thinking?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.530
I think I'm going to do
the snake wrapped around me.

23:39.570 --> 23:41.240
[A'Keria] Monster it up?

23:41.240 --> 23:42.670
You only got one snake?

23:42.670 --> 23:44.040
[Brooke Lynn] Yeah.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.710
I don't know
where this is leading to.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.710
It's just a snake
wrapped around her head.

23:48.710 --> 23:53.210
I don't... [sighs]

23:53.210 --> 23:55.220
I'm definitely getting
in my head a little bit

23:55.220 --> 23:56.380
because A, I have
a lot of pressure on me

23:56.380 --> 23:58.150
because I won
the last design challenge,

23:58.150 --> 24:00.260
and B, I know how to do sexy,

24:00.260 --> 24:02.420
but I'm trying to figure out
how to make it monster.

24:02.420 --> 24:03.460
Do you think
it's monster-y enough?

24:05.490 --> 24:07.230
It's very glamour.

24:07.230 --> 24:09.630
Brooke Lynn is the frontrunner
for this challenge,

24:09.630 --> 24:11.770
but I think she's starting
to feel the pressure.

24:11.770 --> 24:13.470
Hopefully we'll get her
into some trouble, honey.

24:13.470 --> 24:14.770
This is gonna be cute

24:14.770 --> 24:15.700
when you figure out,
like, what it's gonna be.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.970
[laughs]

24:18.440 --> 24:20.740
Yes. Oh, my God.

24:20.740 --> 24:23.650
I'm living already.

24:23.650 --> 24:25.350
Some of these girls
are doing, you know,

24:25.350 --> 24:29.780
scary, spooky skeleton
glamour lady, you know.

24:29.780 --> 24:33.020
And, like, you know,
just like know your history.

24:33.020 --> 24:35.720
Know what are iconic monsters.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.690
So my MILF eleganza

24:38.690 --> 24:40.760
is the Creature
of the Black Lagoon.

24:47.270 --> 24:50.210
I feel like this is actually
really terrifying, right?

24:50.210 --> 24:52.040
[Shuga] Scarlet is definitely
feeling herself.

24:52.040 --> 24:55.080
She's walking up and down
this joint in her own world.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.310
You can kind of see my face,
kind of not.

24:58.310 --> 25:01.250
Creature of the Black Lagoon
is very this.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.980
[A'Keria] You know how when
you go into a movie store

25:02.980 --> 25:05.050
and they got the dollar bin?

25:05.050 --> 25:06.620
So it's like the generic version
of the movie.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.260
Straight to DVD.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.160
Bitch, you hot glue that
or did you sew it?

25:12.160 --> 25:13.330
I sewed it, girl.
Of course.

25:13.330 --> 25:15.460
[laughs]

25:15.460 --> 25:17.370
This is like
at least like six panels.

25:17.370 --> 25:18.400
[all laugh]

25:18.400 --> 25:19.530
Girl, you love a good panel.

25:19.530 --> 25:22.140
And the panel loves her, okay?

25:22.140 --> 25:23.640
I'm talking about the judges,
of course.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.710
Girl, I think that was one time.

25:25.710 --> 25:27.610
Ooh.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.680
[Scarlet] That's more than
they've loved some of us.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.380
Ooh!

25:30.380 --> 25:32.080
Girl.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.780
Scarlet thinks
she is serving right now,

25:33.780 --> 25:36.580
but the only thing
she's serving is holes.

25:38.390 --> 25:40.760
Booty holes. [laughs]

25:40.760 --> 25:44.490
[Silky] That bitch,
she need a rewind.

25:44.490 --> 25:45.660
Try again.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.470
Happy Halloween!

25:51.470 --> 25:53.270
Yes.

25:53.270 --> 25:54.240
All right,
I need to finish shit.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.600
[Nina] It's here, kids.
The Ball is here.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.640
Give me a kiss.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.540
Miss Branjie.

25:59.540 --> 26:00.640
Ooh.

26:02.510 --> 26:03.410
[laughs]

26:05.650 --> 26:06.650
Are y'all excited?

26:06.650 --> 26:08.050
Yes. This is going to be
so fun.

26:08.050 --> 26:09.550
33 looks on the runway.

26:09.550 --> 26:11.090
[Ariel]
That gags me.

26:11.090 --> 26:12.220
This is a good opportunity

26:12.220 --> 26:13.720
to be able to turn out,
like, fun looks.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.520
I love Halloween.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.130
Like, I don't do, like,
spooky drag all the time,

26:18.130 --> 26:19.990
so that's when I have like
an excuse to like force myself--

26:19.990 --> 26:21.700
Really do it, yeah.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.470
[Yvie] Technically speaking,
I'm halfway a Halloween queen.

26:24.470 --> 26:26.130
Like the first time
I ever cross dressed at all--

26:26.130 --> 26:27.670
Yeah.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.170
Was Halloween, because my mom
dressed up as a pimp.

26:30.170 --> 26:31.710
[laughs]

26:31.710 --> 26:33.140
And then I was her dead hooker.

26:33.140 --> 26:34.610
Okay, that's fabulous.

26:34.610 --> 26:37.280
I love that your mom
was the pimp.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.420
My grandma
was definitely not happy.

26:40.420 --> 26:42.680
I don't like going out in drag
for Halloween.

26:42.680 --> 26:46.020
I started my drag career
on Halloween.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.560
It was my friend, you know,

26:47.560 --> 26:48.590
we had dared each other
to actually get in drag.

26:48.590 --> 26:49.690
And of course,
we was trying to see

26:49.690 --> 26:51.130
who was going to be
the fishiest girl.

26:51.130 --> 26:52.490
Who was the fishiest?

26:52.490 --> 26:55.330
Girl, you know who
the fishiest was, bitch.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.700
Probably because I only had on

26:57.700 --> 26:59.570
like the littlest
amount of foundation.

26:59.570 --> 27:01.070
You know we were Plastique.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.570
Um...
[all laugh]

27:03.570 --> 27:05.710
So you're saying Plastique's
still playing the drag?

27:05.710 --> 27:07.610
-Girl.
-Ooh.

27:07.610 --> 27:09.410
[Ra'Jah] Well, you know she just
found her way into it, right?

27:09.410 --> 27:11.310
[Plastique] These girls,

27:11.310 --> 27:13.550
they're just thinking
I'm just a pretty queen.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.350
But when I first
started doing drag,

27:15.350 --> 27:19.590
I was doing spooky, dark,
very demon-like makeup.

27:19.590 --> 27:21.290
So I guess
we'll just have to see.

27:25.260 --> 27:28.600
Let me go over here and see
what these ho's got going on.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.500
She's giving me

29:07.230 --> 29:10.370
Ooh, Ru, my dear, I would have
to say a slutty supermodel,

29:10.370 --> 29:13.400
although that's not
that much of a stretch.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.100
[all laugh]

29:15.100 --> 29:20.110
And the legendary
Mistress of the Dark, Elvira.

29:20.110 --> 29:23.750
Do you know you're one
of my favorite judges ever?

29:23.750 --> 29:27.050
No, but if you hum a few bars,
I can fake it.

29:27.050 --> 29:29.350
[all laugh]

29:29.350 --> 29:32.290
This week

to tuck their halloweenies

29:34.320 --> 29:38.460
and serve three spectacular
looks in the Monster Ball.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.700
That caught us all off guard.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.620
[all laugh]

30:01.620 --> 30:03.180
[A'Keria]
When a lot of girls think sexy,

30:03.180 --> 30:05.290
they run to a nurse
or something like that.

30:05.290 --> 30:07.390
I wanted to see
if I could make a dealer

30:07.390 --> 30:10.630
who sits behind a poker table
look sexy.

30:10.630 --> 30:13.700
And I actually did that,
and I brought the poker table.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.300
[Cara] Ooh, I'd go all in
on that table.

30:15.300 --> 30:16.660

30:49.060 --> 30:52.730
My body looks like
a literal hourglass.

30:52.730 --> 30:55.370
This outfit is like

That is one yummy rabbit.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.770
[Michelle]
But where is her carrot?

30:58.770 --> 31:00.240
[Elvira] That wasn't bunny.

My trampy trick or treater

31:10.720 --> 31:15.290

31:25.430 --> 31:27.100
[Nina] This is one of
my very favorite looks

31:27.100 --> 31:31.070
inspired by the legendary
Little Shop of Horrors.

31:31.070 --> 31:34.480
This is the quintessential
Nina West look.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.710
It has high camp.
It's also high drag.

31:36.710 --> 31:38.310
[Ross] I couldn't really see
back there,

31:38.310 --> 31:39.550
but now I can

31:51.390 --> 31:53.460
you already know
what that means.

31:53.460 --> 31:56.400
Thigh-high boots.
Yes, ma'am. Meow.

32:02.100 --> 32:03.370

32:03.370 --> 32:06.770
Is it a harem girl?
What the hell is it?

32:06.770 --> 32:07.740
[Shuga]
My trampy trick or treater

I mean...whew.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.330
[RuPaul] So gorgeous.

32:31.330 --> 32:32.500
[Brooke Lynn]
It feels amazing

32:32.500 --> 32:34.540
to use my dance training
in the runway.

32:34.540 --> 32:36.240
I don't think there's ever
been a mummy on point

32:36.240 --> 32:38.640
on the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.240
[Ross] Don't you just hate it
when the neighbor kids

32:40.240 --> 32:41.340

32:42.340 --> 32:44.350

32:44.350 --> 32:46.410
Now, you've heard

32:49.420 --> 32:52.620
[Ariel] I'm the only punk rock
PVC Silent Hill nurse.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.490

32:54.490 --> 32:56.060
I've got my goddamn
lips and cheeks done.

32:56.060 --> 32:58.190
So as you can imagine,

32:58.190 --> 33:00.160
there's a lot of syringes
on my shoulders.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.000
[Cara]
You could prick me anytime.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.730
[RuPaul] Well, do you want it
in the ass or in the shoulders?

33:03.730 --> 33:05.500
[Cara]
Ooh, that's what he said.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.670

33:23.180 --> 33:24.520
[Yvie] The little kid me
loved dinosaurs.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.050
I thought I was going to be
a paleontologist.

33:27.050 --> 33:28.460
I wanted to hit on that
a little bit.

33:28.460 --> 33:31.260
This is a children's
Halloween costume

33:31.260 --> 33:33.060
that I've cut
the armholes out of

33:33.060 --> 33:37.300
and then I've attached dinosaur
claws to my cute dino pumps.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.300
This look is dino-mite.

33:40.300 --> 33:41.770

She's just happy to see me.

33:57.390 --> 33:59.790
[Silky] I am wearing
a white sequined jumpsuit

33:59.790 --> 34:02.190
with pink cutouts.

34:02.190 --> 34:04.030
This is only
for the grown and sexy,

34:04.030 --> 34:07.190
so if you ain't grown and sexy,
don't join the line, honey.

34:07.190 --> 34:09.100
Fall all the way back.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.400

34:29.480 --> 34:32.390
Charlize Theron in
Snow White and the Huntsman.

34:32.390 --> 34:36.090
I'm the witch that you
kind of want to be with her,

34:36.090 --> 34:39.660
'cause you want a piece,
but you know she's deadly.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.200
[Ross] She really went out
on a limb with that bird.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.630

34:52.740 --> 34:54.680
[Vanjie] I know they're liking
this interpretation,

34:54.680 --> 34:56.340
'cause I didn't do

34:56.340 --> 34:58.380
the regular-degular
Party City style witch.

34:58.380 --> 35:01.420
I'm taking it
to a high couture runway,

35:01.420 --> 35:04.190
with a fascinator
for the subtleties.

35:04.190 --> 35:07.050

35:34.520 --> 35:36.380
Hay hay!

35:36.380 --> 35:40.190
[Scarlet] My concept
is a Fire Island witch.

35:40.190 --> 35:43.460
She is beachy,
she's kind of swampy,

35:43.460 --> 35:46.430
and she's giving you

35:59.140 --> 36:02.610
by a good old-fashioned
Salem witch,

36:02.610 --> 36:04.210
with flames
coming up the dress

36:04.210 --> 36:05.410
as if I'm being
burned at the stake.

36:05.410 --> 36:08.220
I am serving old school witch.

36:08.220 --> 36:10.480

36:38.750 --> 36:40.580
[Elvira] She's been framed!

36:40.580 --> 36:43.180
[RuPaul] It kind of makes me
want a Bloody Mary.

36:43.180 --> 36:47.320
[Shuga] I am Bloody Mary,
urban legend, spooky queen.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.360
Snatching up all the kids
from the mirror, honey.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.160
I am giving you
latex dripping blood,

36:52.160 --> 36:55.300
tattered Victorian lace dress,

36:55.300 --> 36:57.730
and my teeth are all nasty
and rotted out.

36:57.730 --> 37:00.000
I'm living for this look.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
[RuPaul] Hey, Shuga Cain,
how's your head?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.570
[Michelle] Say it, Elvira.
Say it.

37:03.570 --> 37:04.740
Haven't had any complaints yet.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.610
Oh no!

37:06.610 --> 37:07.740
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.440
[Ross]
She is totally two faced.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.080
[RuPaul] Totally.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.350
[Ross] My eyes are up here.
And here.

37:12.350 --> 37:14.280
[RuPaul laughs]

37:14.280 --> 37:15.350
[Brooke Lynn]
This look is inspired

37:15.350 --> 37:17.380
by the Enchantress
from Suicide Squad.

37:17.380 --> 37:19.220
And oddly enough,

37:19.220 --> 37:22.060
the Enchantress from
Suicide Squad, Cara Delevingne,

37:22.060 --> 37:23.090
is our guest judge this week.

37:23.090 --> 37:24.390
It's amazing.

37:24.390 --> 37:26.690
I'm really hoping
she gets the reference.

37:26.690 --> 37:29.030
[Cara] Oh, skull and bone me.

37:29.030 --> 37:31.130
[Elvira] Hey, wait a minute.
Isn't that my opening costume?

37:31.130 --> 37:33.670
[all laugh]

37:33.670 --> 37:35.400
[RuPaul] Ariel Versace.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.440
[Cara] Bella Hadid,
someone stole your glasses.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.740
[Ariel]
I am in my Witch Please!

37:39.740 --> 37:40.710
giving you a little bit
of Meryl Streep

37:40.710 --> 37:42.380
from Into the Woods,

37:42.380 --> 37:44.310
Miley Cyrus
from Can't Be Tamed.

37:44.310 --> 37:46.050
Avant-garde.
Very like posh.

37:46.050 --> 37:48.120
It's Ariel, witch.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.120
[RuPaul] Michelle,
have you ever seen

37:49.120 --> 37:50.680
the Witches of Beast-wick?

37:50.680 --> 37:51.790
[all laugh]

37:51.790 --> 37:53.220
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

37:53.220 --> 37:56.190
Coven girl,
put the bass in your walk.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.530
[all laugh]

37:57.530 --> 37:59.460
[Yvie] For this look,
I wanted to make sure

37:59.460 --> 38:01.200
that I'm clearly reading
as witch,

38:01.200 --> 38:03.230
but with a fashion twist.

38:03.230 --> 38:05.170
All the other witches
in her coven were jealous,

38:05.170 --> 38:07.570
so they put this curse on her.

38:07.570 --> 38:10.340
But it's not going to stop her
from having a good time.

38:10.340 --> 38:11.540
[Cara] Who said
women can't reverse?

38:11.540 --> 38:14.040
[all laugh]

38:14.040 --> 38:15.440
[RuPaul] Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.610
Nobody beats The Wiz.

38:17.610 --> 38:19.480
[all laugh]

38:19.480 --> 38:22.480
[Silky] I am doing an homage
to black cinema,

38:22.480 --> 38:27.050
The Wiz, as Evillene,
the Wicked Witch of the West.

38:27.050 --> 38:29.490
Don't you bring Miss Evillene
no bad news.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.560
[RuPaul] Ease on down
the runway, girl.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.530
[Michelle] Yes.

38:33.530 --> 38:34.660
[RuPaul] Say hi to Gayle for me.

First up,
A'Keria C. Davenport.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.250

I've seen her on the web.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.550
[all laugh]

38:55.550 --> 38:58.290
[Elvira]
Quick, call the exterminator!

38:58.290 --> 39:00.490
[A'Keria] Tonight, I am
the queen of the spiders.

39:00.490 --> 39:04.060
I padded my body so that
she definitely has a butt

39:04.060 --> 39:06.960
that you wouldn't mind
taking a ride on.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.160
Definitely freakable.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.700
You want some.

39:09.700 --> 39:13.270
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport

39:25.480 --> 39:27.380
[all laugh]

39:27.380 --> 39:30.050
[Vanjie] My look
is inspired by Vanity 6

39:30.050 --> 39:32.590
meet apocalyptic dead ho.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.020
If Vanjie
was supposed to be dead,

39:34.020 --> 39:35.120
this is how she would do it.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.490
I would still look sickening.

39:36.490 --> 39:39.490
I would have my plunging
neckline showing skin.

39:39.490 --> 39:41.430
My hair's so coiffed,
I got my tombstone on my head,

39:41.430 --> 39:43.130
because I want you
to know who I am.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.200
This is sexy bitch to the Tee.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.630
[Michelle] Hey, Vanjie,
how's your head...stone?

39:54.440 --> 39:56.540

39:56.540 --> 39:58.550
[Plastique]
My monster I'd like to freak

39:58.550 --> 40:01.120
is Plastique
Death Goddess glamour.

40:01.120 --> 40:04.620
The makeup is paying homage
to how I started out in drag.

40:04.620 --> 40:06.550
Being drawn
to that more conceptual,

40:06.550 --> 40:08.660
more creepy, spooky makeup.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.390
I hope the judges
can appreciate

40:10.390 --> 40:12.260
I'm trying to do
something different.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.490
[Michelle] She's so handsy.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.530
[Ross] Well, you gotta
give her a hand.

40:15.530 --> 40:17.600
[Michelle] Or two.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.130
[RuPaul] Scarlet Envy.

40:20.130 --> 40:23.340
Ladies and gentlemen,
the shape of wig water.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.640
[Elvira] Wait,
isn't that Roomba's mom?

40:24.640 --> 40:26.510
[all laugh]

40:26.510 --> 40:29.140
[Scarlet] This outfit
is definitely high fashion

40:29.140 --> 40:31.610
meets classic cinema.

40:31.610 --> 40:33.210
The Creature
From the Black Lagoon

40:33.210 --> 40:36.350
meets the New York City
catwalk, darling.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.690
I feel weird.
I feel fashion.

40:38.690 --> 40:41.720
I feel timeless.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.160
[RuPaul] Now, you read about
all the mercury in fish,

40:44.160 --> 40:45.430
but this is ridiculous.

40:45.430 --> 40:47.060
[all laugh]

40:47.060 --> 40:48.400
[thunder]

40:48.400 --> 40:49.530

40:49.530 --> 40:51.500
Oh, look how pretty.

40:51.500 --> 40:52.700
[Cara] Oh.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.100
[Ross] Oh!

40:55.100 --> 40:56.700
It's a gash, a monster gash.

40:56.700 --> 40:59.210
[RuPaul laughs]

40:59.210 --> 41:02.710
[Nina] This is a look
that I am very proud of.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.010
I got this House of Wax vibe
where my face is falling off,

41:06.010 --> 41:08.680
and underneath is this
decayed, deformed woman

41:08.680 --> 41:11.220
crawling out of the grave,
looking for her long lost love.

41:11.220 --> 41:15.560
I feel so alive...
and dead in this look.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.290
[Ross] Honey, your lipstick
is smeared a little bit.

[Elvira] Oh, look at the size
of that snake.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.300
[Ross]
That's her trouser snake.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.670
[Cara] That's the longest
snake I've ever seen.

41:27.670 --> 41:28.700
Well, the only one.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.510
[all laugh]

41:31.510 --> 41:35.410
[Ra'Jah] My MILF Eleganza look
is the bone collector.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.040
Ra'Jah loves to suck
a good bone.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.780
I'm wearing this sickening
pair of pants made of fur,

41:39.780 --> 41:41.620
and then I throw on
some pasties.

41:41.620 --> 41:45.420
I am serving you skeleton
drag queen realness.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.690
[RuPaul] Hey,
when you finish the runway,

41:47.690 --> 41:50.360
could you slip by my house
and snake my drain?

41:50.360 --> 41:51.830
[all laugh]

41:51.830 --> 41:53.760
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.500
[Elvira] Somebody forgot
their bikini wax.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.560
[RuPaul] Working the merkin.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.470
[Michelle laughs]

41:59.470 --> 42:02.770
[Shuga] I'm feeling this
sexy wife of Satan MILF.

42:02.770 --> 42:06.310
She is giving you body,
feathers and bones

42:06.310 --> 42:08.540
and full seventies merkin.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.010
I think I'm freakable.

42:10.010 --> 42:12.680
[Ross] She's so L.A. now.
An L.A. Ram.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.580
That's a football reference.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.180
[Michelle] Oh, my God,
I got it.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.550
[RuPaul] Michelle,
have you heard my new song?

42:17.550 --> 42:20.550
It's called
I am a Merkin, a Merkin.

42:20.550 --> 42:21.660
[all laugh]

42:21.660 --> 42:23.790
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

42:23.790 --> 42:25.090
[Ross] Sissy that walk.

42:25.090 --> 42:26.760
[all laugh]

42:26.760 --> 42:28.260
[Cara] Citizen Cane?

42:28.260 --> 42:30.530
[Brooke Lynn]
I am a black widow.

42:30.530 --> 42:33.270
This bitch has buried
like five husbands.

42:33.270 --> 42:35.070
My look's
an off-the-shoulder gown,

42:35.070 --> 42:38.370
with this black tulle wafting
around me almost like smoke.

42:38.370 --> 42:40.410
I feel dark. I feel spooky.
I feel sexy.

42:40.410 --> 42:43.180
[RuPaul] Get these
motherfucking snakes

42:43.180 --> 42:45.780
off this motherfucking stage.

42:45.780 --> 42:47.650
[all laugh]

42:47.650 --> 42:50.180
[RuPaul] Ariel Versace.

42:50.180 --> 42:52.550
[Cara]
Areola, the Little Mermaid.

42:52.550 --> 42:54.720
[Elvira] Now I know why
she calls herself Ariel.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.590
[all laugh]

42:56.590 --> 42:58.830
[Ariel] So a mermaid
and Tinkerbell went into a bar

42:58.830 --> 43:00.460
and the rest is history.

43:00.460 --> 43:03.530
She is a creature from the
Jersey Shore covered in scales.

43:03.530 --> 43:06.030
I know these other queens
are green with envy.

43:06.030 --> 43:07.470
[Cara] Nyes.

43:07.470 --> 43:09.100
[RuPaul] What's that perfume
you're wearing?

43:09.100 --> 43:10.770
[Elvira] Catch of the day?

43:10.770 --> 43:13.410
[all laugh]

43:13.410 --> 43:15.680
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.650
[Cara] She must be
a fellow Brit with those teeth.

43:19.650 --> 43:21.580
[Michelle laughs]

43:21.580 --> 43:25.720
[Yvie] My look is this fashion
forward eleganza voodoo doll.

43:25.720 --> 43:30.090
And I've got pieces of frogs
and old hands stuck in my hair,

43:30.090 --> 43:33.660
and my face has got stitches
and a big ol' button eye.

43:33.660 --> 43:35.700
[Michelle] She's serving
lace, lace, lace.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.630
[RuPaul laughs]

43:37.630 --> 43:39.530
[thunder]

43:39.530 --> 43:42.500
[RuPaul] And now in a scene
from Macbeth, Dr. Ganache.

43:42.500 --> 43:46.210
[Elvira] Out! Out, damn spot!

43:46.210 --> 43:49.580
[Silky]
I am a red she-devil.

43:49.580 --> 43:53.650
Red mermaid gown with leather
and fur hugs all my curves.

43:53.650 --> 43:56.120
And I changed up my makeup.

43:56.120 --> 43:59.290
Through my beauty, I wanted
to show a little beast.

43:59.290 --> 44:01.360
I hope those judges
are horny to see me.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.490
[Michelle]
Elmo, the later years.

44:03.490 --> 44:04.690
[all laugh]

44:04.690 --> 44:07.090
[thunder]

44:07.090 --> 44:08.500
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

44:08.500 --> 44:11.100
Based on your
Monster Ball looks,

44:11.100 --> 44:12.630
I've made some decisions.

44:15.270 --> 44:16.670
When I call your name,
please step forward.

44:19.070 --> 44:19.870
Nina West.

44:21.410 --> 44:22.710
A'Keria C. Davenport.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.610
Scarlet Envy.

44:26.610 --> 44:29.150
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

44:29.150 --> 44:31.080
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

44:31.080 --> 44:34.960
Ladies, you are all safe.

44:38.130 --> 44:38.960
You may leave the stage.

44:42.260 --> 44:44.260
What a bunch of monsters.

44:44.260 --> 44:45.500
[all chuckle]

44:45.500 --> 44:47.770
Ladies, you represent

44:47.770 --> 44:50.240
the treats and the tricks
of the week.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.140
[chuckles]

44:52.140 --> 44:53.740
And now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

44:53.740 --> 44:57.210
Up first, Plastique Tiara.

44:57.210 --> 44:59.110
The trampy trick or treater.

44:59.110 --> 45:01.620
Your body was stunning.
Whoa.

45:01.620 --> 45:03.680
By the way, I used to work
at a Playboy club.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.450
I wasn't a bunny.
I was cleaning the restroom.

45:06.450 --> 45:10.260
[all laugh]

45:10.260 --> 45:12.290
Your makeup in all three looks
was incredible.

45:12.290 --> 45:14.160
The MILF Eleganza,
the makeup, the details,

45:14.160 --> 45:16.460
the way you held your mouth,
just perfect.

45:16.460 --> 45:18.670
[Michelle] This look
is the most fuckable.

45:18.670 --> 45:20.600
but I'm missing personality.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.400
There's just a pretty you
walking down the runway,

45:23.400 --> 45:26.170
and I'm missing
some kind of a connection.

45:26.170 --> 45:28.210
All right, let's
move on down to Shuga Cain.

45:28.210 --> 45:30.680
The Witch Please! I loved.

45:30.680 --> 45:33.180
I love horror movies and I want
to watch that movie right away.

45:33.180 --> 45:35.020
[Elvira] Your trampy
trick or treater,

45:35.020 --> 45:36.580
I didn't know
what the heck it was.

45:36.580 --> 45:39.750
The upside is it's something
no one's ever seen before.

45:39.750 --> 45:41.220
[all laugh]

45:41.220 --> 45:42.760
And hopefully
will never see again.

45:42.760 --> 45:44.730
[all laugh]

45:44.730 --> 45:47.530
It was a troll doll.
Those trolls?

45:47.530 --> 45:50.100
So when I was little,
I didn't have a lot of friends,

45:50.100 --> 45:52.130
and I had tons of trolls,

45:52.130 --> 45:53.770
those little ones
with the little crazy hair.

45:53.770 --> 45:56.040
And I used to talk with them
and perform in front of them.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.600
I just wanted to do something
that meant something to me.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.440
It's a beautiful story.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.710
Yet you have to tell a story,

46:01.710 --> 46:02.940
so that means we didn't get it.

46:04.710 --> 46:07.380
This MILF just looks messy.

46:07.380 --> 46:09.020
You're better than this.

46:09.020 --> 46:10.680
And the carpet
is not matching the drapes.

46:10.680 --> 46:13.620
It's hard to want to freak
that Merkin, that's the thing.

46:13.620 --> 46:15.220
I was trying to do
like a tribal,

46:15.220 --> 46:18.560
like, satanic
like wife of the devil.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.190
I love the ideas,
but you have to be able

46:21.190 --> 46:22.700
to portray to us
what you're doing.

46:22.700 --> 46:25.370
[RuPaul] Up next,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

46:25.370 --> 46:28.170
[Elvira] I particularly loved
the first look,

46:28.170 --> 46:30.740
because I've also
been wrapped up in bandages.

46:30.740 --> 46:32.270
I'm sure you have.

46:32.270 --> 46:34.040
Well, but I also did it
professionally.

46:34.040 --> 46:36.010
[all laugh]

46:36.010 --> 46:38.150
That costume,
it just was amazing.

46:38.150 --> 46:40.280
And obviously you're
some kind of ballerina

46:40.280 --> 46:41.320
or something, right?

46:41.320 --> 46:42.620
Oh, Lordy.

46:42.620 --> 46:44.720
[all laugh]

46:44.720 --> 46:46.290
I could not believe
you were just like la-la-la.

46:46.290 --> 46:48.390
I was just blown away by that.

46:48.390 --> 46:50.720
[Cara] Your Witch Please!,
that kind of looks like

46:50.720 --> 46:52.730
when I played the Enchantress
in Suicide Squad.

46:52.730 --> 46:54.360
That's literally
my inspiration.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.500
-Stop it!
-I found out you were a judge,

46:55.500 --> 46:57.230
and I was like,
oh, fuck off, no way.

46:57.230 --> 46:58.730
-[Cara] No way.
-[Brooke Lynn] Yes.

46:58.730 --> 47:00.330
The way you danced, I was
like I should have probably

47:00.330 --> 47:02.440
taken some lessons
before I'd done the movie,

47:02.440 --> 47:04.200
because that was incredible.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.470
Thank you.

47:05.470 --> 47:07.540
And then,
this look I freaking love.

47:07.540 --> 47:10.010
I like that
it's the counter point.

47:10.010 --> 47:12.250
You're barely moving,
and you still carried it off.

47:12.250 --> 47:14.750
I would borrow this outfit
from you for my day look.

47:14.750 --> 47:16.220
[all laugh]

47:16.220 --> 47:18.690
Up next, Ariel Versace.

47:18.690 --> 47:20.620
I loved the syringes
coming out the shoulders

47:20.620 --> 47:23.460
in the trampy
trick or treater realness.

47:23.460 --> 47:24.690
But the bottom
was ill fitting.

47:24.690 --> 47:27.330
The idea was cute.

47:27.330 --> 47:30.730
The execution was marginal.

47:30.730 --> 47:34.670
And your Witch Please!,
I was getting like saloon.

47:34.670 --> 47:36.540
I was trying to do like
an avant-gardey kind of thing.

47:36.540 --> 47:40.210
But it wasn't avant-garde.
It was 1800s.

47:40.210 --> 47:41.740
The glasses were avant-garde,

47:41.740 --> 47:43.610
which had no place
in that outfit.

47:43.610 --> 47:46.680
And then there's nothing
monstrous about this.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.350
This is a mermaid.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.350
[Ariel] I guess
I was just trying to like

47:51.350 --> 47:54.420
rest on something that I knew.

47:54.420 --> 47:56.490
[Ross] Every week,
it's, you know, it's cute.

47:56.490 --> 47:58.390
But it's just
what do you bring?

47:58.390 --> 48:00.390
-What's your legacy in drag?
-Right.

48:00.390 --> 48:02.660
Are you giving it to us?

48:02.660 --> 48:05.530
[Ariel] I always like
present myself

48:05.530 --> 48:07.100
as somebody
who's like really strong.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.440
And for some reason
that hasn't--

48:09.440 --> 48:12.070
I feel like I haven't
been able to show that yet.

48:12.070 --> 48:13.440
[Ross] Have you ever
watched the show

48:13.440 --> 48:14.670
and heard other queens
say that same thing?

48:14.670 --> 48:16.480
Yeah.

48:16.480 --> 48:17.610
And did you want to scream
at them from your living room?

48:17.610 --> 48:19.350
Yes. Yes.

48:19.350 --> 48:20.710
Here's the deal.
We're five weeks in.

48:20.710 --> 48:21.980
Now's the time to push.

48:24.050 --> 48:27.020
Yvie Oddly.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.420
Your trampy
trick or treater look...

48:30.220 --> 48:32.360
Speechless. Phenomenal.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.430
One of my favorites
in this whole show.

48:34.430 --> 48:37.000
You didn't just come out
as a dinosaur.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.400
You told a story
without any words.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.770
You have little T-Rex arms.

48:39.770 --> 48:41.230
You can't reach it
when you drop it.

48:41.230 --> 48:43.300
[all laugh]

48:43.300 --> 48:44.600
I have seen a lot of drag,

48:44.600 --> 48:47.770
but that really
was in my top 10 list

48:47.770 --> 48:51.210
of most unique,
odd drag moments.

48:51.210 --> 48:53.380
It was just so damn funny.

48:53.380 --> 48:55.520
And you looked
sort of oddly sexy.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.020
[laughs]

48:57.020 --> 48:58.390
Oh, my God, your laugh,

48:58.390 --> 49:00.290
I tell you, you should laugh
all the time,

49:00.290 --> 49:02.560
because every time you laugh,
I laugh.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.520
Unless I'm in a movie theater,
I swear to God.

49:04.520 --> 49:09.060
[all laugh]

49:09.060 --> 49:12.730
The Witch Please! was good
because it was simple,

49:12.730 --> 49:14.670
but it was so tasteful.

49:14.670 --> 49:18.470
You know, the hat going over
one eye, the little glove.

49:18.470 --> 49:19.440
There was something
you could have added,

49:19.440 --> 49:22.180
something just
that little element more.

49:22.180 --> 49:24.340
Next time I'll eat a baby.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.410
Great. That's what we want.

49:25.410 --> 49:27.210
[laughs]

49:27.210 --> 49:28.680
Let's talk about this monster
I'd like to freak.

49:28.680 --> 49:31.590
This is like monster I'd
like to take to a fundraiser.

49:31.590 --> 49:34.590
[all laugh]

49:34.590 --> 49:36.420
You know what I mean?
I don't get it.

49:36.420 --> 49:38.630
I was just trying to go
for a voodoo doll,

49:38.630 --> 49:41.630
but I wanted to try to be
a little bit more glamorous.

49:41.630 --> 49:43.630
So this is glamour to you?

49:43.630 --> 49:47.170
[Yvie] I just didn't execute
everything to one vision.

49:47.170 --> 49:49.170
I kind of picked a few

49:49.170 --> 49:51.400
and was like that's glamour
and that's punk

49:51.400 --> 49:54.040
and that's Yvie, so here we go.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.540
[Ross]
But when you have a challenge

49:55.540 --> 49:58.350
that is monster
I'd like to freak--

49:58.350 --> 49:59.410
and you are a freak...

49:59.410 --> 50:01.150
[laughs]

50:01.150 --> 50:03.080
Freaking do it.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.450
When I call you a freak,

50:04.450 --> 50:05.720
that is the biggest compliment
I can give you.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.290
Oh, girl, I hope so.

50:07.290 --> 50:08.490
Otherwise people have been
insulting me my whole life.

50:08.490 --> 50:10.560
No.[all laugh]

50:10.560 --> 50:12.290
Well, I promise

50:12.290 --> 50:13.960
I won't ever sabotage myself
with glamour again.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.960
Well, we still want to see you
do some glamour.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.430
And, you know,
you've got a couture body.

50:17.430 --> 50:20.270
You could really rock
something gorgeously.

50:20.270 --> 50:21.670
I'll do it when appropriate.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.040
We'll hold you to that.

50:23.040 --> 50:27.210
Up next,
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

50:27.210 --> 50:30.410
When you did the little
unicorn, adorable.

50:30.410 --> 50:32.080
It was sort of a cute

50:32.080 --> 50:34.210
children's trick
or treaty thing, you know,

50:34.210 --> 50:36.620
with sex thrown in, which really
doesn't go together, but...

50:36.620 --> 50:39.050
Okay, never mind.

50:39.050 --> 50:40.650
[Ross] Your Witch Please!

50:40.650 --> 50:42.060
It's a reference
to The Wiz, right?

50:42.060 --> 50:43.220
Absolutely.

50:43.220 --> 50:45.130
I liked that
you went to The Wiz,

50:45.130 --> 50:48.400
but your hair, your paint,
you were Oprah.

50:50.730 --> 50:54.300
Now, this last look,
you look so sexy.

50:54.300 --> 50:55.540
You look absolutely gorgeous.

50:55.540 --> 50:56.740
Thank you.

50:56.740 --> 50:59.770
But the dress making
is a bit shabby.

50:59.770 --> 51:01.440
I can kind of see places

51:01.440 --> 51:04.180
where the fur is thicker
on one side, not the other.

51:04.180 --> 51:05.710
It looked cheap.

51:05.710 --> 51:09.450
And I really don't get monster
besides the horns on your head.

51:09.450 --> 51:12.620
[Elvira] And horns do not
a monster make.

51:12.620 --> 51:15.660
Ask anybody who was in
Manos: The Hands of Fate,

51:15.660 --> 51:17.520
an obscure B-movie reference.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.390
I don't do monster well.

51:19.390 --> 51:22.060
I only paint one mug,
and it's a beauty mug.

51:22.060 --> 51:22.730
[Michelle] No, I know.
You are a pageant girl

51:22.730 --> 51:24.560
through and through.

51:24.560 --> 51:28.540
But I have to remind you kids to
really think of the challenge.

51:30.640 --> 51:33.140
[RuPaul] All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

51:33.140 --> 51:34.570
While you untuck backstage,

51:34.570 --> 51:37.240
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:37.240 --> 51:41.150
All right,
just between us witches,

51:41.150 --> 51:43.220
what do you think?

51:43.220 --> 51:45.690
Starting with Plastique Tiara.

51:45.690 --> 51:48.720
Those looks were incredible.
Plastique is stunning.

51:48.720 --> 51:50.360
The colors, she's stunning.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.160
[Elvira] It's Drag Race.
You need more than just looks.

51:53.160 --> 51:55.230
You need personality.

51:55.230 --> 51:57.360
[RuPaul] But I love
the fact that her MILF

51:57.360 --> 51:59.570
was actually a monster,

51:59.570 --> 52:02.140
and she took the time
to create a horrific face,

52:02.140 --> 52:03.600
but still kept the beauty.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.410
She did a really fine job.

52:05.410 --> 52:08.580
All right, let's move on.
Shuga Cain.

52:08.580 --> 52:10.210
[Ross]
The looks were just confusing.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.410
She needs to hand out
a pamphlet with each outfit

52:12.410 --> 52:14.580
so I can figure out
what the hell is going on.

52:14.580 --> 52:17.120
I was just lost.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.220
You can see
that she's talented.

52:18.220 --> 52:19.620
She really can
sell a character,

52:19.620 --> 52:23.190
like the Witch Please!,
when she does it properly.

52:23.190 --> 52:25.530
But that MILF Eleganza, I don't
know what was going on there.

52:25.530 --> 52:27.190
She tried to make it better
by licking the thing,

52:27.190 --> 52:29.160
but licking
can only take you so far.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.200
[all laugh]

52:31.200 --> 52:33.170
This was just
not her challenge.

52:33.170 --> 52:35.240
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-mm.

52:35.240 --> 52:37.800
Let's move on
to Brooke Lynn Hytes.

52:37.800 --> 52:40.710
I love, love, love,
love, love, love, love,

52:40.710 --> 52:42.240
love Brooke Lynn Hytes.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.440
How do you really feel
about Brooke Lynn?

52:43.440 --> 52:45.650
I may be a little biased.
Whatever.

52:45.650 --> 52:49.220
All of those looks to me
was someone I want to freak.

52:49.220 --> 52:52.220
[Elvira] Yeah. She captured all
these different macabre looks.

52:52.220 --> 52:53.750
The mummy,
the witch doctor,

52:53.750 --> 52:56.360
and then that beautiful,
elegant,

52:56.360 --> 52:58.530
kind of an Addams Family
character.

52:58.530 --> 53:00.190
The costumes were amazing.

53:00.190 --> 53:02.760
[Cara] Just to watch her move
was hypnotizing.

53:02.760 --> 53:07.070
Yes, that extra element
really pushed it over the top.

53:07.070 --> 53:10.240
Ariel Versace from New Jersey.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.070
I was having
a little bit of déjà vu.

53:12.070 --> 53:14.070
-I've seen it all before.
-Mm-hmm.

53:14.070 --> 53:16.710
[Elvira] Nothing super
different, super unique.

53:16.710 --> 53:19.380
The final look
didn't read monster at all.

53:19.380 --> 53:20.380
Look, I'm Ariel.
I'm a mermaid.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.220
Kind of meh-maid.

53:22.220 --> 53:23.320
[laughs]

53:23.320 --> 53:25.420
Guys, I'm almost
at a loss with Ariel.

53:25.420 --> 53:28.420
I don't think she knows
what she needs to do.

53:28.420 --> 53:31.760
She has an idea of what she is,
but this competition forces you

53:31.760 --> 53:35.300
to rethink everything
that worked back home.

53:35.300 --> 53:37.400
In this context,
you've got to amp it up.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.070
And if you can't,
you shouldn't be here.

53:40.070 --> 53:41.730
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

53:41.730 --> 53:44.140
Yvie brought something to
the party that nobody else did,

53:44.140 --> 53:45.640
and that was humor.

53:45.640 --> 53:48.680
I mean, she put claws on pumps,
you guys.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.240
[all laugh]

53:51.240 --> 53:52.780
Has anyone
ever done that before?

53:52.780 --> 53:54.310
-No.
-No.

53:54.310 --> 53:55.450
Then she dropped the head
and she couldn't get it.

53:55.450 --> 53:57.920
[all laugh]

53:59.650 --> 54:02.760
[Ross] But that last look
was so bad.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.090
[Michelle]
There was no monster.

54:04.090 --> 54:05.460
Nothing that you wanted to eff.

54:05.460 --> 54:07.630
Nothing that I wanted
to eff, marry, or kill.

54:07.630 --> 54:11.060
It's unfortunate that the last
look didn't really hit the mark,

54:11.060 --> 54:13.300
but I wanted to single her out

54:13.300 --> 54:16.200
because I was so impressed
with her first two looks.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.270
-Yeah. Me, too.
-[Michelle] So good.

54:17.270 --> 54:21.740
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache
Zeta-Jones.

54:21.740 --> 54:24.180
Her trampy trick or treater,
I actually liked that.

54:24.180 --> 54:25.350
[Cara] But there's something

54:25.350 --> 54:27.110
that could have
made the look better,

54:27.110 --> 54:30.450
more pronounced
on the detailing, maybe.

54:30.450 --> 54:32.020
And I had trouble
with the second one.

54:32.020 --> 54:34.050
I thought it was Oprah Winfrey
going as Dolly Parton

54:34.050 --> 54:36.190
for her Halloween costume.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.560
She was being Evillene
from The Wiz,

54:38.560 --> 54:41.760
but Evillene is evil,
and she didn't capture that.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.260
The dress and the makeup

54:43.260 --> 54:45.670
didn't measure up
to the original at all.

54:45.670 --> 54:47.370
And the final look,
there was no monster in it.

54:47.370 --> 54:48.640
And the dress,
when she turned around,

54:48.640 --> 54:49.770
you saw the undergarments.

54:49.770 --> 54:51.340
It was ill-fitting.

54:51.340 --> 54:53.240
Silky is such a fun queen,

54:53.240 --> 54:55.410
I would have liked to see her
have fun with the monster.

54:55.410 --> 54:56.480
Really go there.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.040
She said
she only paints pretty.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.710
Well, stretch a little, honey.

54:59.710 --> 55:01.210
There's $100.000 on the line.

55:01.210 --> 55:02.220
Get ugly, girl.

55:02.220 --> 55:03.520
Silence.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.620
Sorry.

55:05.620 --> 55:07.990
I've made my decision.

55:07.990 --> 55:11.190
Bring back my ghouls.

55:11.190 --> 55:13.130

Shuga Cain.
Tonight, Shuga don't bite.

56:09.550 --> 56:12.590
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:12.590 --> 56:14.690
[Shuga Cain] I'm mad.

56:14.690 --> 56:18.320
I did not come here
to be in the bottom again.

56:18.320 --> 56:20.490
I just worked so hard
to get here.

56:20.490 --> 56:21.490
It breaks my heart.

56:21.490 --> 56:23.260

you scared tonight is you.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.970
Tonight you were all beauty,
no beast.

56:37.540 --> 56:38.440
Silky.

56:41.010 --> 56:42.050
You are safe.

56:45.450 --> 56:46.720

56:46.720 --> 56:49.290

Ariel, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:56.200 --> 56:59.030
Two queens stand before me.

56:59.030 --> 57:00.430
Prior to tonight,

57:00.430 --> 57:02.970
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

57:02.970 --> 57:07.170
of I'm Your Baby Tonight
by the great Whitney Houston.

57:07.170 --> 57:11.640
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:11.640 --> 57:14.750
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.550

57:29.700 --> 57:31.630
I need to kill this lip sync.

57:31.630 --> 57:36.040
Okay, bitch, it is time
for you to show Mama Ru

57:36.040 --> 57:37.340

57:37.340 --> 57:40.570
'cause tonight,
you are not going home.
