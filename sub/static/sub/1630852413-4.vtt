WEBVTT

00:07.215 --> 00:08.675
Oh, what's up?

00:08.758 --> 00:10.719
-What happened?
-He didn't let me in.

00:11.219 --> 00:14.264
God knows who he was with,
but we're having lunch on Monday.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.433
-Here, I'll change her.
-Hang on.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.767
-What?
-A selfie.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.685
Look.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.772
But don't you dare post it.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.984
I don't understand your need
to post everything you do online.

00:26.484 --> 00:30.155
-Come, honey.
-Relax, I'll just save it for me.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.410
This time it'll be a double diaper change
with an extra something.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.412
But it's fine, this way you'll learn.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.956
In the beginning,
it's a bit hard, but it gets easier.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.125
How can something so small smell so bad?

00:42.208 --> 00:44.127
Pay attention, first you put the diaper.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.754
-What's going on here?
-And… Ana.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.256
This is Pablo.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.886
I met him when he came here
all drunk and made a scene.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.554
Sorry, that was really wrong.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.473
Mariana and I are good now.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.017
Really? How did that happen?

00:59.100 --> 01:02.187
Mariana realized her lawyer was a bitch.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.440
-She lied about me and said stuff--
-Pablo was just leaving.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.776
I'll tell you everything myself, okay?

01:13.865 --> 01:16.534
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:13.341 --> 02:16.386
Mariana, how could you bring
that guy here with the girls?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.555
It's not like Pablo is a criminal.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.558
I was very angry
and maybe overreacted a bit.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
He threatened you, didn't he?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.812
No, it's not like that.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.772
I just thought things through.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.066
I'd like Pablo and Regina
to have a connection,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.819
just like the one Juan Carlos
has with Ceci and Ro.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.113
Why didn't you tell me this?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.698
Regina is like my daughter.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.326
And this guy feels like an ex
I don't want to see ever again.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.828
Ana, don't worry.

02:41.911 --> 02:45.582
Come on, give him a chance,
he's not as bad as I said he was.

02:46.082 --> 02:46.916
For real.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.252
Okay.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.463
Invite him over to dinner
the day after tomorrow.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.842
But tell him in this household
dinner starts at 8:00 sharp.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.051
Okay, yes, yes.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.346
I'm meeting Juan Carlos
and I'm late. See you later.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.056
All right. Thanks.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.643
We've been married for 20 years,

03:05.727 --> 03:07.645
but lately we argue a lot.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.022
Just as every marriage does.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.524
If we can't tell things as they are,
it's pointless.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.525
How are things?

03:13.151 --> 03:15.486
Her top priority is her work.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.363
-No.
-It comes before her family, us.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.575
-We have a baby and that--
-She worked the day the baby was born.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.410
The driver was almost the midwife.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.955
I have a very demanding job,
but I always manage.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.499
-I've got it under control.
-That's the problem.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.793
-You want to control everything.
-Yes, honey.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.879
That's why things work.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.505
Let's see okay. Okay.

03:35.381 --> 03:39.886
Your first assignment will be
to let Juan Carlos take charge this week.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.763
The idea is letting him

03:41.846 --> 03:45.433
make the important decisions at home
and see how you feel.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.144
Take some time for you two,

03:48.228 --> 03:49.938
to be together as a couple.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.485
Who does she think she is?

03:55.568 --> 03:59.280
Stupid Estela won everyone over
with some dumb lipsticks, look.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.157
So what?

04:01.241 --> 04:04.452
Voting will soon begin
for the graduation organizing committee.

04:04.535 --> 04:05.703
We're both competing.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.538
I guess you'll lose.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.165
Of course not.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.543
I have to come up
with something cooler to give out.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.630
This is not a competition,

04:16.214 --> 04:18.049
but a collaboration.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.679
I need you to prepare a presentation
for the members of the board

04:22.762 --> 04:25.556
with our company's strategies
in Latin America.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.434
Sure. I could do most of it
if you want, Ana,

04:28.518 --> 04:30.603
so you don't neglect the babies.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.022
Babies? Two of them?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.234
That's another story.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.778
But don't worry, my personal life

04:38.861 --> 04:41.239
has never interfered
with my professional life.

04:41.739 --> 04:45.201
You better behave
so they let you visit Regina.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.411
You're shitting me.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.706
Yes, so don't even think
of wearing those ripped jeans of yours.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.251
-What's wrong with them?
-No political or religious talk either.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.546
If they ask you about soccer,
you love the America.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.341
No, fuck no. I'd never do that.
I won't betray my Pumas.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.469
Don't say that you live
with four other dudes either.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.680
Really? I have to pretend
to be someone else?

05:08.349 --> 05:11.436
ANUAR - SORRY MARIANA… I WON'T MAKE IT.

05:12.603 --> 05:13.938
Unbelievable!

05:14.022 --> 05:15.648
Okay, don't get angry.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.607
It's not that.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.901
Sorry, my dad just canceled on me.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.611
-Why?
-I don't know.

05:20.695 --> 05:25.074
I thought he wanted to reconnect,
but I guess not.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.536
-See you at dinner, okay?
-Okay.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.830
I'll pay you back every last cent.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.335
-Lorena and I will be partners.
-Good, I hope it works.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.755
I just want Regina and Mariana
to have a place to live.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.299
Of course, me too.
That's what the business is for.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.762
Transfer me the payments,
that way we don't have to meet.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.805
Will do, don't worry.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.766
-Bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

05:52.727 --> 05:53.644
Come, darling.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.729
Come, hurry.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.190
I'll show you the microblading products.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.318
All I need now is clients,
but I'll get those in a flash.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.987
Where did you get
the money to buy all this?

06:03.071 --> 06:05.031
Oh, from, uh… it's credit.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.451
Well, more like a loan. It's called…

06:08.993 --> 06:11.204
"Entrepreneur Mexico,"
maybe you've heard of it.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.205
Anuar stood me up.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.379
I'm sorry, darling.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.882
But you know Anuar.
He's always been like that.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.592
No, not always, Mom.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.010
Look.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.228
I didn't know you cared so much.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.356
Well, frankly, I didn't use to.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.191
But…

06:41.609 --> 06:43.861
now that I have Regina, the truth is…

06:44.362 --> 06:48.408
I want her to have a loving family
that's always in her life.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.659
Am I making any sense?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.536
Of course, I get it.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.453
Come here.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.125
Oh, I hate him.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.461
Manolo threw me under the bus
with Jorge over the babies.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.465
What's worse, he said his new assistant
is more efficient than you.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.759
What? He's a misogynist.

07:09.637 --> 07:13.266
I went over the new products
R&amp;D is developing.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.934
-Oh, really?
-And I made a list…

07:15.435 --> 07:18.020
of those we can promote
in Latin American markets.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.063
Show me.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.858
I'm here, how may I help you?

07:21.941 --> 07:26.237
We're fine, thanks. Cynthia
really pulled it off, we're almost ready.

07:26.904 --> 07:27.780
Thanks anyway.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.120
You're the worst, Anuar.

07:35.037 --> 07:38.332
-You broke her heart.
-But you told me not to go.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.126
-You didn't want me to see her.
-Yes.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.211
But I did it to protect her.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.882
-You know why, don't you?
-All right, fine.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.758
So, should I meet with her or not?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.470
You can help me.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.640
What kind of beauty product
would you like as a gift?

07:56.976 --> 07:57.977
I don't know.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.564
Maybe…

08:02.815 --> 08:04.942
tweezers to pluck my eyebrows.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.611
Tweezers, really?

08:07.111 --> 08:10.740
I thought of it because my mom
started an eyebrow-tattoo business.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.493
Your mom does microblading?

08:13.576 --> 08:14.827
My dad is an engineer.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.746
And… thank you.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.707
And my mom's an orthodontist.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.297
So, you live with them?

08:26.380 --> 08:27.632
No, I just moved out.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.467
I share an apartment with a friend.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.219
See, Mom? Everyone has a roomie.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.305
I'll move out at 21.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.890
Over my dead body.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.059
Besides, you're not "everyone."

08:38.142 --> 08:39.393
Well, this is temporary.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.188
Until I can move
to the apartment I bought.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.690
You bought an apartment?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.485
What do you do for a living?

08:48.027 --> 08:53.032
Pablo has an engineering degree
in computer sciences.

08:53.783 --> 08:58.079
He's helping me with the app
I told you about. He's kind of a genius.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.124
Well, Mariana is the one
who's done all the research.

09:03.751 --> 09:04.585
Ceci.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.504
Ceci.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.005
You're drooling.

09:09.173 --> 09:13.094
You survived the first round,
but here's the million-dollar question.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.305
What soccer team is your favorite?

09:22.478 --> 09:25.565
Well… America, obviously.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.277
-"Hate me more."
-Eagle brothers.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.570
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.697
I wish I could stay longer.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.324
-But I have homework.
-What's it about?

09:35.408 --> 09:39.412
An essay about marijuana legalization.
Whether I'm for or against it.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.122
You're for it, right?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.669
Do you think…

09:48.045 --> 09:49.547
they should legalize it?

09:52.633 --> 09:55.678
Well, marijuana has many benefits.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.971
It's been demonized.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.933
But whatever, huh?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.894
-Who wants to talk about this now?
-Me, I do.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.479
You were saying…

10:06.647 --> 10:10.067
That it's legal in many countries
for medical purposes.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.946
And what about recreational use?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.741
Do you smoke weed?

10:19.201 --> 10:20.119
Do you?

10:24.665 --> 10:26.709
Only occasionally, not often.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.753
When my rheumatism acts up.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.465
Well, it's getting late.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.091
-We should all go to bed.
-Yes.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.092
What about dessert?

10:36.052 --> 10:37.094
There's no dessert.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.056
-What about the bananas and cream?
-They're for breakfast.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.604
Can I pick up Regina tomorrow?

10:46.687 --> 10:47.521
-Yes.
-No.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.359
I don't think it's a good idea.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.069
Regina isn't used to it.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.528
But she'll get used to it.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.574
Besides, we can't take away
Regina's right to be with her dad.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.535
-Exactly.
-Since when do you care about baby rights?

11:02.286 --> 11:05.998
Since I get to decide this week,
I say yes.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.501
Pablo can take Regina tomorrow.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.296
All right. But the nanny has to tag along.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.381
No.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.967
You won, dude!

11:17.051 --> 11:19.261
-The referee.
-You're so preppy, Pablo.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.598
-Did you go to dinner dressed like that?
-Of course, I had to look good.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.266
So, how did it go?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.936
Ana gave me the third degree.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.939
But Mariana was really cool.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.651
I bet she wants
to get back together with you.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.944
No, I don't think so.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.196
But we're a family now.

11:37.988 --> 11:38.906
Check this out.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.494
So cute!

11:43.577 --> 11:46.122
It's cool, post it on your Instagram.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.374
-No, Mariana asked me not to.
-Idiot.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.960
If a girl says no,
it means yes, and vice versa.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.920
You're the idiot. No always means no.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.172
You said she was cool, dumbass.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.675
-She wants you to post it.
-Give it.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.136
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Wait.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.470
It's posted, dude, it's up.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.513
#HAPPYFAMILY

12:02.596 --> 12:04.765
-You'll be fine, dude.
-Fuck, yeah!

12:04.849 --> 12:06.684
-Come on, bro.
-Hell yeah, dude!

12:06.767 --> 12:07.935
That's how you do it!

12:08.018 --> 12:09.770
Awesome, dude.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.689
That's what I'm talking about!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.693
#HAPPYFAMILY

12:15.776 --> 12:18.195
Ro, will you lend me your phone?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.739
My battery died.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.284
Okay, but promise
not to go through my photos.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.456
I'll use it as a GPS to track Pablo.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.541
You should've started with that.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.293
Thank you, sweetie.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.714
Call me if you need anything.
I'm going to Xochimilco to see my dad.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.967
-What if he stands you up again?
-No, he won't. He called me.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.010
Oh, okay.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.554
Hi, you little penguin.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.182
Regina. Her name is Regina.

12:46.766 --> 12:51.312
Look here's the instructions,
which you should follow to a tee.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.106
Okay? You can't take Regina
out of the complex.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.277
Here's the diaper bag with two bottles.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.196
Diapers, wipes, and spare clothes.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.781
You'll do fine, don't worry.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.117
-Teach him how to use the chair…
-Yes.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.870
-And the stroller.
-Look, this gray button.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.538
This is to get her out.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.167
You push both of these at the same time
and take the whole thing out, okay?

13:13.250 --> 13:16.045
-All right. We're all set, baby.
-Like this, right…

13:16.128 --> 13:16.962
I'll get it.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.302
-Hello.
-Hi.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.347
When Dany said it was all for free,
we couldn't believe it!

13:26.430 --> 13:31.977
All you need to do is vote for me as head
of the graduation organizing committee.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.604
You can count on us!

13:33.687 --> 13:35.606
-Okay, come on in.
-Thanks.

13:35.689 --> 13:36.565
Take a seat.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.737
You'll have to wait a bit,
but here's some magazines and lemonade.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.780
-Thanks.
-All of them?

13:42.863 --> 13:43.781
Yes.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.244
Lore, can you please come help me?

13:48.869 --> 13:52.248
Yeah, I have a ton of clients.
I can't manage by myself.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.793
All right, and you know what?
I'll need more supplies.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.921
Will you buy some?
I'll pay you here. Please.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.047
I'll be here.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.222
Sorry I'm late, traffic was impossible.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.271
Did you wait long?

14:15.354 --> 14:16.647
A bit, but…

14:17.773 --> 14:20.234
I haven't been here
since the three of us came here.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.485
Me neither.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.364
You might not remember,
but on that day, your mom…

14:25.447 --> 14:27.116
got so dizzy.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.494
Actually, I still have
the picture we took together.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.745
Shall we take one now?

14:31.829 --> 14:32.997
-Yes, yes.
-Yes?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.874
-With the trajineras?
-Yes.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.126
Here.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.712
There. Smile.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.673
Just as I thought, jerk!

14:44.049 --> 14:45.718
Fanny, what are you doing here?

14:45.801 --> 14:48.554
You were acting strange.
So, I went through your phone.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.805
Who's this?

14:50.514 --> 14:53.517
-What's wrong with you?
-She's Mariana, my daughter.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.686
This is Fanny.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.397
My girlfriend.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.858
Oh, sorry, Marianita. How are you?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.527
Okay.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.572
Why didn't you tell me, Anui?
We could be friends.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.577
I got a trajinera with your name on it.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.704
Look, here it is.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.956
Let me help you.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.835
MARIANA

15:24.506 --> 15:27.051
We'll have the best time ever!

15:28.218 --> 15:29.178
What up, Conris?

15:30.679 --> 15:32.056
Bowling, now?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.390
No, dude, I can't.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.935
I'm with my little penguin.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.312
With Regina, idiot.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.022
Wait, hold on.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.277
Hey, what do you think?

15:45.861 --> 15:48.238
Shall we go or stay? Go?

15:48.322 --> 15:50.574
Yes, let's go. It was your call.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.410
Hello? Yes, we're on our way.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.828
Okay.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.790
Hey, will you order some fries? For Regis.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.084
Right? No hot sauce.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.001
Okay.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.796
Right now,
I'm a cycling instructor at a gym.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.255
I'm studying nutrition.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.883
I even got your dad on a diet,
right, chubby cheeks?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.720
Why don't you tell us
how you're doing as a mom?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.390
Good. Do you want
to meet your granddaughter?

16:14.473 --> 16:15.557
Yes, yes.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.186
Look.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.148
Oh, she's so pretty.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.234
She has a beautiful smile.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.030
Oh, I can't believe
I'm a grandma at twenty-four.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.282
Twenty-four, Dad?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.994
She turns 25 this month.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.079
Young…

16:37.997 --> 16:40.249
but delicious. Don't you want a taste?

16:40.916 --> 16:43.210
I have my presentation later.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.170
Taste it, you'll love it.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.380
Fine!

16:50.509 --> 16:52.845
I'm glad you're the boss this week.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.013
I know.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.225
You have no idea
what I prepared for tonight.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.393
Oh, really?

16:59.476 --> 17:01.729
And you can't disobey me, huh?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.023
What's that?

17:04.773 --> 17:07.234
It's an alarm I set on my phone.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.570
What for?

17:10.070 --> 17:12.156
So I remember to check where Pablo is.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.828
I planted Rodrigo's cellphone
in the diaper bag to track him.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.330
What?

17:21.123 --> 17:23.042
I knew I couldn't trust him.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.585
And look…

17:25.377 --> 17:27.588
he's taking Regina who knows where.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.757
He's her dad, 
who cares where he takes her?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.425
No, no, no.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.510
I shouldn't have let him take her.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.720
Where are you going?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.473
Check, please.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.894
Twenty percent for your tip.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.395
Good one!

17:43.479 --> 17:45.814
-There you go!
-Great, great.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.066
Check this out.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.735
I'm here, team!

17:49.818 --> 17:50.819
Great!

17:50.903 --> 17:53.238
My firstborn and future heir.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.324
-Say hi to your uncles.
-Hi, baby girl.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.450
He's irresponsible.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.744
But I love him anyway.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.414
Once we get married,
we'll get a house with a garden.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.042
And your room will be
right next to the nursery.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.794
You know your way around babies.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.922
Nanny and all, so great, huh?

18:10.005 --> 18:13.008
We can all live together
like a happy family!

18:13.092 --> 18:14.551
I really like your daughter.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.304
We have so much in common.
Why didn't you mention her?

18:17.930 --> 18:18.806
What?

18:18.889 --> 18:21.308
You never mentioned me,
but want more kids?

18:21.391 --> 18:23.018
I don't want any more children.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.771
What do you mean?
We've talked about this many times.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.272
And every time I said no.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.066
You're so selfish.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.451
You know what? This was the worst idea.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.996
No, Mariana, wait.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.957
No, you stay here.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.251
I always wanted to be in your life!

18:48.127 --> 18:50.796
There's many things you don't know,
talk to your mom!

19:01.849 --> 19:03.684
The instruction list I gave Pablo.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.352
My goodness!

19:08.939 --> 19:12.442
Look at them passing her around
with no regard for safety.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.111
Hey, hey!

19:15.237 --> 19:16.738
We agreed we'd keep our distance.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.491
What's up, honey?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.577
Mom, I need to talk to you.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.704
Oh, darling, I'm very busy right now.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.205
Can I call you later?

19:25.289 --> 19:28.625
Anuar said I should ask you
to tell me the whole story.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.420
Don't listen to him.
Your dad's just weird like that.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.505
I'll call you later, please. Bye.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.049
"Happy family."

19:36.133 --> 19:38.218
Dude, chill out.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.847
Hey, shall we get to it?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.682
What's the hurry?

19:44.266 --> 19:48.228
She just found out her ex-girlfriend
got back with her ex-boyfriend.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.231
Your ex-boyfriend, aren't you a lesbian?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.278
Shut up, stupid. Her ex-boyfriend.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.740
All right.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.244
ELENA - WHAT A CUTE…!

20:06.997 --> 20:08.957
ELENA - WHAT A CUTE FAMILY!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.334
Little penguin.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.960
Penguin, penguin.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.879
Check out your daddy's strike.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.130
-Check it out.
-Look.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.007
-Look at Daddy.
-Look.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.133
Look, yeah.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.804
Cheers, cheers!

20:22.888 --> 20:24.514
She'll be a good drinker, huh?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.183
No, no.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.144
There.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.065
Do you know how many germs
those dreadlocks must have?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.112
Oh, no, no.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.744
You shouldn't… No, where to?

20:45.827 --> 20:48.121
Ana, no, where are you going? No. Ana!

20:48.205 --> 20:49.164
Ana!

20:50.249 --> 20:53.710
Get your hair out of her mouth!
She'll catch something!

20:53.794 --> 20:56.421
Come here, baby. My girl.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.798
-Ana?
-My baby.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.175
What are you doing here?

21:00.926 --> 21:03.387
Bringing Regina here
was not part of the deal.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.306
-Spying on me wasn't either.
-It's clear you can't be trusted.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.476
How could you let
the girl put his hair in her mouth?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.687
Chill, ma'am, we're just drinking.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.397
Don't call me ma'am, idiot.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.942
I found the list of rules
crumpled by the door.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.861
But I'm her dad.
Do you always set the rules at your home?

21:19.945 --> 21:20.779
Yes.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.699
Well, sometimes we argue,
but Ana always wins.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.575
In that case, let's make a bet.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.868
Okay, what's at stake?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.954
-The winner sets the rules.
-Fine.

21:29.037 --> 21:29.997
-One game.
-Okay.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.123
-No!
-Hell, yeah!

21:31.623 --> 21:33.709
Juan Carlos and I against you and any guy.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.668
-You're on.
-Okay.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.794
This will be good!

21:35.877 --> 21:37.963
-Ana.
-Come on. Let's show them.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.798
What about your presentation?

21:41.008 --> 21:43.051
It's with my work team, they can wait.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.013
It's Regina's future.
Besides, look at them.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.014
I'm sure they suck.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.890
-Come on.
-Let's do it.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.309
Ana is running a late.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.810
Well, I'm here.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.396
I'm Cynthia, Ana's assistant.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.189
Nice to meet you.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.567
I am Matheus, chairman of the board.

21:59.318 --> 22:03.238
I wasn't coming, but I made
some time in my schedule and here I am.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.448
GET HERE. IT'S URGENT!

22:04.531 --> 22:06.241
-Sorry for coming unannounced.
-Come in.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.409
Where's Ana?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.411
Ana is on her way.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.747
She asked me to start…

22:12.456 --> 22:14.291
presenting one of the products

22:14.374 --> 22:17.461
that R&amp;D is developing and that…

22:17.961 --> 22:19.087
we want to promote.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.841
Will you give me a second?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.511
Ana…

22:26.636 --> 22:29.264
the chairman of the board
showed up out of the blue.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.141
Everyone is waiting for you.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.684
Get here, please.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.063
I'm so good!

22:38.940 --> 22:39.775
Fuck, yeah!

22:53.288 --> 22:54.206
Come on, come on.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.583
Great one, dude!

23:04.758 --> 23:07.260
Please, let him botch it. Just botch it.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.345
Miss, miss.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.350
-Hell, yeah!
-That's it, dude!

23:13.433 --> 23:15.310
Good one, bro!

23:15.394 --> 23:16.978
-Cool, dude!
-Good, for fuck's sake!

23:17.062 --> 23:18.397
We have to do something.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.023
We can't lose.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.359
Who would've thought they'd be this good?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.362
What if they actually win?

23:26.071 --> 23:28.448
If they win, I'll sue Pablo…

23:29.032 --> 23:30.659
so I don't have to deal with him.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.495
Regina can't have
such an irresponsible dad.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.081
Well done, dude.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.835
-We only need one strike.
-Bro, you have to let them win.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.003
-Why?
-They want to sue you.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.256
And we know the kind of lawyers they have.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.133
Seriously?

23:54.349 --> 23:55.684
I'll present to you

23:55.767 --> 23:58.311
our disposable menstrual cup.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.480
It's very easy to put in.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.860
You just insert it and…

24:06.903 --> 24:07.821
It fills up.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.073
And…

24:10.157 --> 24:11.366
Sorry, sorry.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.786
Thanks, but I can't keep waiting for Ana.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.205
Listen, the product is interesting,

24:17.789 --> 24:21.918
but I was expecting to hear
about the financial market analysis.

24:22.002 --> 24:22.919
Thank you.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.380
No, this is part of the analysis--

24:25.464 --> 24:28.341
That's not a financial analysis
that I want.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.135
Matheus, good evening.

24:30.218 --> 24:34.139
George said Ana had an emergency.
So, I'll take over the presentation.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.016
That's great news, Manolo.

24:36.099 --> 24:38.560
Good. I'm glad you're here.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.190
Gentlemen, well,

24:43.273 --> 24:45.233
we'll leave the cups for some other time.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.194
And we'll start with the statistics…

24:47.277 --> 24:48.778
MANOLO IS HERE, TOO LATE, ANA.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.280
…from the 2019 report.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.125
-Yes!
-Great!

25:02.209 --> 25:03.752
We're back on top!

25:05.754 --> 25:07.255
-You're up, sweetie.
-Yes.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.594
I mean, I get you're letting them win,

25:12.677 --> 25:14.763
but don't make us look bad.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.519
Come on!

25:26.233 --> 25:27.108
Yeah!

25:28.610 --> 25:31.196
We're the best!

25:32.030 --> 25:33.365
Not to disappoint you,

25:33.448 --> 25:35.116
but Pablo is letting us win.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.078
Why? How do you know? Are you sure?

25:38.161 --> 25:39.663
Yes, I am, I heard them.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.383
Did you think I wouldn't notice, kid?

25:51.466 --> 25:52.884
You're letting me win.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.763
Do you think
I can't beat you on my own merit?

25:56.846 --> 25:58.098
No, that's not it.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.141
Then, what is it? Why do this?

26:00.225 --> 26:02.227
This is for Regina,
don't you care about her?

26:02.310 --> 26:03.853
Of course I care about her.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.439
But if I win, I'll lose anyway.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.526
I heard you tell Juan Carlos you'd sue me.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.739
I don't care who wins this stupid bet,

26:15.824 --> 26:18.034
I only care about seeing my daughter.

26:20.453 --> 26:21.288
You're up.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.588
Yeah!

27:11.671 --> 27:13.298
Oh, hold on tight.

27:13.381 --> 27:14.549
-It's on.
-There you go.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.596
NINE MISSED CALLS

27:20.639 --> 27:21.765
I should get going.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.976
-Okay. Bye.
-See you, girl.

27:27.979 --> 27:28.813
Hey.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.191
What's up with you?

27:31.691 --> 27:33.276
Why are you mad at me?

27:36.404 --> 27:37.906
You're back with Pablo, Mariana.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.616
What are you talking about?

27:40.950 --> 27:42.243
Cute family.

27:42.994 --> 27:46.373
-Come on, I'm not back with Pablo.
-I don't need explanations.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.751
I agreed to let Pablo be in Regina's life.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.710
That's all.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.129
Right now, I'd rather be single.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.758
My priority is for Regina
to have a family, even if mine is a mess.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.135
What makes you say that? What's going on?

28:00.345 --> 28:01.262
Nothing.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.598
I had the shittiest day.

28:05.433 --> 28:09.145
I wanted to reconnect with my dad.
So, we spent the day together.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.563
It was a mess.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.400
The asshole has a 25-year-old girlfriend.

28:14.109 --> 28:14.984
Damn.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.529
That's fucked up.

28:17.612 --> 28:18.446
I'm sorry.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.199
I miss you, dude. I miss you so much.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.284
I miss my best friend.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.582
I really miss you too.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.754
It was a huge success. Everyone loved it.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.047
I know.

28:36.131 --> 28:40.009
The problem is the budget was way off.

28:41.886 --> 28:42.804
Look.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.056
Geez, Tere.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.641
That much?

28:46.725 --> 28:47.559
Yes.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.812
Between the extra supplies

28:50.895 --> 28:53.189
and the number of clients that came, well…

28:53.273 --> 28:55.108
I blew past my original budget.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.194
-My sponsor is going to kill me.
-No, no.

28:58.778 --> 28:59.654
No.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.157
Don't worry.
This was my fault, I'll take the loss.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.242
Don't worry, I'll cover the costs.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.119
Okay, again.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.328
Your mom is so good.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.664
She hit three strikes in a row.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.585
-I didn't know you were that good, Mom.
-I'm amazing.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.837
When we dated, we went bowling a lot.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.506
-We should go more often.
-More often.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.592
-She still has the touch.
-Right?

29:21.259 --> 29:22.469
What's up?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.679
-Hello.
-What did I miss?

29:25.346 --> 29:26.723
We had a change of plans.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.058
I took the penguin bowling, then they--

29:29.142 --> 29:32.103
Yes, I see. I kept calling you,
but you never picked up.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.646
Thanks for inviting me.

29:49.412 --> 29:53.291
Sorry for not telling you, honestly.
It was all so last minute.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.169
But it was a…

29:58.087 --> 29:59.964
pleasant surprise, frankly.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.593
In spite of Pablo…

30:04.135 --> 30:05.887
not following my rules and…

30:07.013 --> 30:09.808
did what he wanted,
I came to realize he's a good dad.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.814
Did I say something wrong?

30:16.314 --> 30:17.190
No.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.610
I wish I could say the same about my dad.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.030
My day with Anuar sucked.

30:24.113 --> 30:24.948
Really?

30:25.990 --> 30:30.537
I'm also sure that he and my mom
are hiding things from me

30:30.620 --> 30:32.455
and I hate being kept in the dark.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.332
I'm sorry.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.628
Well, let's make a deal, okay?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.672
From now on…

30:41.589 --> 30:44.092
let's not do things
behind each other's back.

30:45.134 --> 30:45.969
Okay?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.139
And you should talk to your mom.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.853
You're entitled to know
whatever they're not telling you.

31:07.156 --> 31:10.910
PABLO - SORRY FOR TAKING REGINA BOWLING

31:10.994 --> 31:13.705
MARIANA - YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

31:20.879 --> 31:25.133
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU AND I ARE OFFICIALLY A FAMILY?

31:28.553 --> 31:32.682
IT MEANS YOU AND I
ARE OFFICIALLY REGINA'S PARENTS.

31:36.936 --> 31:41.274
AND DON'T POST OUR PICTURES EVER AGAIN!

31:53.703 --> 31:55.204
See you at counseling?

31:55.288 --> 31:58.499
Oh, I don't know about you,
but I think we're cured.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.668
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.588
I have good and bad news.

32:04.047 --> 32:07.759
Good news is I'm head
of the graduation organizing committee.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.677
What's the bad news?

32:10.178 --> 32:13.848
I need dad to give me
more money to settle a debt.

32:13.932 --> 32:14.891
How's that?

32:14.974 --> 32:18.686
Tere had to give me money
for the microblading event.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.439
-She miscalculated.
-We have to help her, honey.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.067
Yes.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.072
I won't leave until you tell me
what you and Anuar are hiding.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.658
All right.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.744
But I want to make it very clear,

32:34.827 --> 32:36.955
that everything I've ever done in my life

32:37.914 --> 32:39.832
has been to protect you.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.042
Do you understand?

32:46.172 --> 32:47.882
Anuar is not your biological father.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.218
What?

32:51.219 --> 32:54.180
Then, who is my father? Mom!

32:57.892 --> 32:59.185
I can't tell you.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.145
Because I don't know.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.815
How is that possible?

33:04.440 --> 33:07.151
What do you want me to say? I don't know.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.152
I'm sorry.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.738
-Where are you going?
-I don't believe you.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.031
Mariana…

33:13.658 --> 33:16.619
-You're unbelievable.
-Mariana, we're not done, come back.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.538
-Mariana!
-For fuck's sake!

33:21.207 --> 33:24.002
Take some time off.
I understand your situation.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.631
But if you're here,
I need your full commitment.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.634
It's the first time
I've let you down in 15 years.

33:31.718 --> 33:32.885
It won't happen again.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.722
Yeah, but it happened
when the chairman came.

33:40.643 --> 33:41.561
Ana…

33:41.644 --> 33:46.232
I hadn't told you, but there's an opening
for the COO position.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.191
I rooted for you.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.902
-Rooted?
-Now I'm not sure.

33:49.986 --> 33:53.656
I need to know
you have the dedication and time

33:53.740 --> 33:54.824
for this position.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.458
-Mariana, you forgot your keys…
-Hello, Tere.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.293
Ceci, hi. What brings you here?

34:05.376 --> 34:09.088
I wanted to thank you
for being so nice the other day.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.715
I have a surprise for you.

34:10.798 --> 34:13.801
I brought an expert
to help with your business plan.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.929
Really? That's so nice of you,
you didn't have to.

34:20.767 --> 34:21.809
Hello, Tere.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.436
Hello.

35:35.591 --> 35:38.594
