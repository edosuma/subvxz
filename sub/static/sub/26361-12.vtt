00:03.699 --> 00:05.788
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:05.831 --> 00:07.311
sexually based offenses

00:07.355 --> 00:09.313
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.750
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:11.794 --> 00:13.883
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.926 --> 00:15.232
are members of an elite squad

00:15.276 --> 00:17.147
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.191 --> 00:20.150
These are their stories.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.673
- That's right, an eye
on the ball, right?

00:21.717 --> 00:23.501
both: Eye on the ball.
- Nice and easy, okay?

00:23.545 --> 00:26.200
Nice and easy.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.418
Oh, you ripped it!
- Oh!

00:27.462 --> 00:28.680
- Oh, he ripped it!
Go, go!

00:28.724 --> 00:30.291
- Nice hit!
- Oh, my goodness!

00:30.334 --> 00:32.075
- Nice hit!
- You got a good kid there.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.512
- You should see him
at dinnertime or bedtime

00:34.556 --> 00:36.427
or homework time.
- Whoo-hoo, all right!

00:36.471 --> 00:38.081
- Well, all kids
go through phases.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.083
I'm told.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.563
Well, whatever he's
going through right now,

00:41.606 --> 00:44.305
I gotta tell you,
I'm a little over it.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.309
Maybe he just...

00:48.352 --> 00:51.051
needs some masculine energy.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.878
both: Hey!
- Home run!

00:52.922 --> 00:54.271
- Thanks, Coach!
- Boom!

00:54.315 --> 00:55.533
You wanna do it again?
- Yeah, let's do it.

00:55.577 --> 00:56.752
- All right, good job.
Let's go.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.971
- Okay.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.799
- All right, line up there.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.020
Same again, nice and easy.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.501
- Thank you.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.981
both: Mm.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.679
Home sweet home.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.550
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for coming with.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.900
I know my father
was happy to see you.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.554
- I love my old man-in-law.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.165
He's a lot more fun
on New Year's Eve

01:18.208 --> 01:19.557
than my father ever was.

01:20.732 --> 01:21.951
That's the third time
this month.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.387
- I'll call the super.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.782
- It's just--
it's so thoughtless.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.960
- I'll call first thing
in the morning.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.093
- Ugh.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.445
- Come on.
Let's make this quick.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.882
Come on.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.279
Okay, come on.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.862
- Hey, Gavin?

02:03.906 --> 02:06.430
We're out of shampoo.

02:06.474 --> 02:09.825
I can't find my hairbrush.

02:09.868 --> 02:10.956
No!

02:12.219 --> 02:13.829
No! Gavin!

02:13.872 --> 02:15.004
No, no!

02:15.047 --> 02:16.266
Get off of me!

02:16.310 --> 02:18.138
Gavin!

02:18.181 --> 02:20.270
Gavin!

02:20.314 --> 02:22.272
No!

02:22.316 --> 02:25.057
Please!

02:25.101 --> 02:26.537
No, no, please!

02:26.581 --> 02:29.018
Please stop!

02:39.159 --> 02:40.943
I screamed,

02:40.986 --> 02:42.684
and I-I tried to run,

02:42.727 --> 02:45.469
but he, um,
threw me on the bed

02:45.513 --> 02:47.819
and he tied me up,
and he, um--

02:47.863 --> 02:49.169
he r-raped me.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.301
- I'm so, so, so, so sorry,

02:51.345 --> 02:53.173
and we're gonna get you
to the hospital.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.478
- I just knew
something terrible

02:54.522 --> 02:55.914
was gonna happen tonight,
I just knew it.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.525
- Okay, you said that
he wore a ski mask.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.222
Do you remember
anything else about his--

02:59.266 --> 03:01.093
about his height or his build?

03:01.137 --> 03:02.791
He--he was average.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.141
I-I think he--
I think he was white.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.795
- Okay, and is there anything
else that you remember?

03:06.838 --> 03:09.319
Anything that he said,
anything at all?

03:09.363 --> 03:11.278
Um, he--he told me

03:11.321 --> 03:13.280
to be quiet.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.325
He said that if I--
I screamed again,

03:15.369 --> 03:17.022
that he would--
he would kill Gavin!

03:17.066 --> 03:19.329
- Okay, let's get you
to the hospital, okay?

03:19.373 --> 03:21.462
- Okay, come on.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.204
You're gonna be okay.
- I was at the kitchen sink.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.858
Felt a knife
at the back of my neck.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.817
- Any idea how he got in?

03:28.860 --> 03:31.385
- We--we just got home
from the holidays.

03:31.428 --> 03:34.083
The building door
was propped open.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.389
I-I thought there was
something off

03:35.432 --> 03:36.694
about our doorknob.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.174
- Okay, you didn't see
his face.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.828
Anything about his voice?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.960
- It was--was low.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.353
Creepy.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.790
He said to lay on the floor.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.357
Tied me up.

03:47.401 --> 03:50.230
Stacked plates on my back.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.362
He said if I moved he'd hear

03:52.406 --> 03:55.191
and April was dead.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.454
- Okay.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.328
- Fin.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.764
So April Baker says

04:02.807 --> 04:04.418
the attack happened
around midnight.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.028
She managed to free herself--

04:06.071 --> 04:07.725
untie herself
three hours later.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.554
- Husband says son of a bitch
stacked plates on his back.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.208
- So while he's raping her,

04:12.252 --> 04:13.905
he can hear
if the husband moved.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.255
- Exactly.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.605
- Let's get inside.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.781
- So whoever did this
disassembled the door latch

04:19.824 --> 04:21.391
then jerry-rigged it
back together

04:21.435 --> 04:23.175
so that nobody would notice.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.916
- The perp staked out the place
when they were out of town?

04:24.960 --> 04:25.917
- We're looking at a pro.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.442
- Maybe worse.

04:35.492 --> 04:38.321
- Is this for real?

04:38.365 --> 04:39.888
- Surveilling the apartment,

04:39.931 --> 04:41.759
breaking the door lock,
stacking plates.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.892
- I didn't want
to believe it either.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.981
How long has it been?

04:46.024 --> 04:48.679
- Twenty-five years.

04:52.030 --> 04:55.295
The Infinity Rapist.

05:43.125 --> 05:46.824
- So Infinity's last rape
was January 2, 1994.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.652
I was a rookie
in the five-five.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.176
Everyone in the five Boroughs
knew about that case.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.396
- Uh, not so much in Georgia.
How many rapes was he good for?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.486
- Twenty-two, in Manhattan
and Brooklyn from '81 to '94.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.053
This guy targeted couples.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.968
He'd case out the place,
jimmy open a door or window.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.839
Then he'd lie in wait,
break in a second time.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.624
- He'd tie up the boyfriend
or husband,

06:03.667 --> 06:05.277
then he'd stack plates
on their back

06:05.321 --> 06:07.671
and he said if he heard
a rattle, the woman was dead.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.717
- He took trophies.
Small personal items.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.849
After the fifth rape,
he started leaving messages.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.677
"Infinity: 5.
NYPD: 0."

06:13.721 --> 06:15.287
- You, know, if this is him,

06:15.331 --> 06:17.028
he's been out of commission
for over two decades,

06:17.072 --> 06:19.466
which makes him middle-aged
or older.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.945
So do we alert Crime Stoppers?
- No.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.904
Until we know
what we're dealing with,

06:22.947 --> 06:25.863
One P.P. wants to keep it
on the "DL."

06:25.907 --> 06:29.301
- Okay, no DNA
in April's rape kit.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.868
CSU found two hairs
in the bed

06:30.912 --> 06:32.479
but they're not a match
to the Bakers

06:32.522 --> 06:34.437
and no match in CODIS.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
- Okay, so check that DNA
against old evidence.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.442
Have Stone do some digging.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.404
- Twenty-five years later.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.840
Did they get a sense
of this guy's age?

06:45.883 --> 06:46.623
- Uh, no.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.277
They said that he, uh--

06:48.320 --> 06:50.540
he spoke in a low voice,
he told the wife to keep quiet.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.063
They didn't fight back,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.456
so there's no sense
of his physicality either.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.198
- Here you go.

06:56.241 --> 06:59.680
"Infinity, '81 to '94."

06:59.723 --> 07:01.899
There's over a dozen of them.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.380
I'll get you a dolly.
- All right, thanks, George.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.122
- This is gonna take forever.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.778
Hey, you never told me
your dad was on the case.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.214
- What?
- Yeah.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.694
"Ben Stone,
District Attorney's Office.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.436
Joint Infinity Task Force."

07:18.263 --> 07:19.395
- I didn't know.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.483
I was in school.

07:20.527 --> 07:23.225
We never talked
about his cases.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.403
- "The Infinity Rapist"?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.752
You guys think it was him?

07:28.796 --> 07:30.101
That's...

07:30.145 --> 07:31.451
Horrifying.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.104
- Well, we--we don't know
for sure, but the--

07:33.148 --> 07:36.891
the M.O. of the assault
was--was almost exact.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.937
So, April, do you remember...

07:39.981 --> 07:44.072
seeing anybody watching you
or watching your building?

07:44.115 --> 07:46.117
An older man?

07:46.161 --> 07:48.337
- No.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.600
- Okay, um...

07:50.644 --> 07:52.602
He threatened to kill Gavin.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.518
Did he say anything else
that you can remember?

07:55.562 --> 07:59.043
Anything at all.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.958
- He told me to shut up.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.004
He put his hand over my mouth

08:03.047 --> 08:07.312
like he didn't want me
to make a sound.

08:07.356 --> 08:10.315
- Did anything go missing?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.926
- No.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.189
We had cash in a desk.
My jewelry box was untouched.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.496
- This would have been
something personal.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.889
- N-no.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.631
Uh, wait.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.242
I couldn't find my hairbrush.

08:24.286 --> 08:27.681
Does that matter?

08:27.724 --> 08:29.596
- Uh, it might.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.076
It might.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.732
- I had no idea how haunted
my father was about this case.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.386
- Yeah, a lot of people
in law enforcement

08:37.429 --> 08:38.648
lost sleep over this guy.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.869
He was like the Zodiac
or the Son of Sam.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.175
- These notations
in my father's handwriting?

08:44.219 --> 08:46.351
They're dated 2017.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.918
- That's a year before he died.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.138
- Yeah.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.671
- Hey, Carisi, look at this.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.632
- Who's this?
- That's me and my father.

09:05.675 --> 09:06.894
- How old are you here?

09:06.937 --> 09:08.373
- Uh, seven?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.158
- How'd that get in
the case file?

09:10.201 --> 09:12.595
- I don't know.

09:16.164 --> 09:19.297
- Okay, we have unmarked cars
on the Bakers' block, right?

09:19.341 --> 09:21.386
We're monitoring their calls?
- Nothing so far.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.172
This guy was
and continues to be a ghost.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.477
- Nope, not a ghost.

09:25.521 --> 09:26.870
A copycat.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.263
We've been going over
the old case files.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.570
Ben Stone was the lead ADA
in the case.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.832
- I didn't realize that.

09:31.875 --> 09:32.876
- And whoever attacked
the Bakers

09:32.920 --> 09:34.443
was definitely not Infinity.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.228
The signatures,
the reconnaissance, the plates.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.579
That was all in the papers,
plus three books.

09:39.622 --> 09:40.884
- What wasn't made public

09:40.928 --> 09:42.582
and what was consistent
with each victim:

09:42.625 --> 09:44.975
He forced them to pretend
they were enjoying the assault.

09:45.019 --> 09:45.976
Lovely.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.282
- For the tied-up husband
to hear.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.371
- And this guy
made April keep quiet.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.721
- The Infinity's got a lot
of fans online.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.854
Serial rapist, serial killer
message boards.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.769
I mean, believe it or not,
that's a thing.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.075
- So one of these guys
got bored fantasizing

09:58.119 --> 09:59.424
and made it real?

09:59.468 --> 10:01.209
- Twenty-five years to
the day to the last rape,

10:01.252 --> 10:02.602
marking the anniversary.

10:02.645 --> 10:06.040
- Okay, so I've got Infinity's
Wikipedia page up.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.260
Hold up, it was--
it was last updated

10:09.304 --> 10:12.612
two hours before
the Baker assault.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.178
- Who?

10:14.222 --> 10:18.574
- Uh, the username
is "RealInfinity23."

10:18.618 --> 10:21.882
- Have TARU track down
the address.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.103
- His name's Karl Patton.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.714
He posts on all
the Infinity message boards

10:27.757 --> 10:28.889
and belongs to all
the online fan clubs.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.368
This guys is obsessed.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.936
- You mean "sick freak."

10:34.634 --> 10:37.375
NYPD.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.681
- What?

10:38.725 --> 10:39.682
- We're looking
for Karl Patton.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.075
- My little brother?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.251
Whatever you think he did,
he probably did.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.253
- Where is he?

10:48.212 --> 10:50.301
Karl!

10:50.345 --> 10:52.739
Karl!

10:52.782 --> 10:55.829
He's probably in his work room.

11:11.061 --> 11:14.238
- You were right,
this guy is obsessed.

11:14.282 --> 11:17.372
- Looks like we found
our copycat.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.595
- What's this?

11:23.639 --> 11:24.771
- You Karl Patton?

11:24.814 --> 11:27.904
- You can call me "Infinity."

11:27.948 --> 11:29.906
- You're under arrest.

11:29.950 --> 11:33.170
- I wondered what took you
so long.

11:33.214 --> 11:36.304
- I ain't cuffing this guy.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.706
- Don't you feel
the excitement?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.403
Soon the whole world
will know who I am.

11:48.446 --> 11:49.578
- Cut the crazy.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.711
Tell us about this woman.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.277
- Sweet, sweet April.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.715
- Just answer the question.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.151
- She smelled like roses.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.587
Fresh out of the shower.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.110
- Okay, let's--

12:00.154 --> 12:02.591
let's start with why
you were in her bedroom.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.027
Your side of the story.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.594
- You're playing with me,
right?

12:05.637 --> 12:07.465
Good cop, bad cop?
- Look, the game's over, Karl.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.641
And wipe that stupid smirk
off your face.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.470
Tell us what you did.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.778
- I've been waiting
for this moment for 25 years.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.649
I want to savor it.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.782
- I'm done.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.090
- Wait!

12:23.133 --> 12:25.614
I want to confess.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.095
- We're listening.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.836
- I stalked April.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.098
I raped her.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.490
- What about her husband?

12:32.534 --> 12:34.666
- I tied him up,
stacked plates on his back.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.800
Told him if I heard
so much as a rattle, game over.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.193
That's my signature.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.108
- Your signature?

12:41.151 --> 12:42.631
- Of course.

12:42.674 --> 12:46.200
But you knew that.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.116
- This guy laying out
his own insanity defense?

12:49.159 --> 12:50.465
- He's not doing a bad job.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.206
- Well, he can't be Infinity.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.817
Patton wasn't born until
a year after the first rape.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.123
- What's his history?

12:56.166 --> 12:58.865
- He's an unemployed
computer programmer.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.127
From his social media,

13:00.170 --> 13:02.172
he's been obsessed
with Infinity

13:02.216 --> 13:03.521
since he was a teenager.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.219
- And we know he's good
for April and Gavin?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.874
- He planned it to commemorate
the 25th anniversary

13:07.917 --> 13:10.137
of Infinity's last rape.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.443
The DNA found on the hairs
from the Bakers' bedroom

13:12.487 --> 13:15.185
is a match,
and CSU found April's brush

13:15.229 --> 13:16.665
in his work room,

13:16.708 --> 13:18.841
which was a treasure trove

13:18.885 --> 13:21.365
of Infinity's paraphernalia...

13:21.409 --> 13:23.019
including this letter,

13:23.063 --> 13:26.414
which I had the lab make
a copy of.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.417
- For me?

13:29.460 --> 13:32.550
- Apparently it's from
the real Infinity...

13:34.030 --> 13:37.207
To your father.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.564
- On one count of rape
in the first degree,

13:46.608 --> 13:48.566
one count of assault
in the first degree,

13:48.610 --> 13:50.481
one count of kidnapping
in the second--

13:50.525 --> 13:53.267
- Shouldn't that be 23 counts?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.008
- Counselor, how does
your client plead?

13:55.051 --> 13:56.226
- Not guilty.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.185
- People on bail?
- Remand.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.187
This brutal assault
was premeditated,

14:00.230 --> 14:02.058
an homage to the
real Infinity's last rape

14:02.102 --> 14:03.233
down to the date and the time.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.713
- I am the real Infinity!

14:04.756 --> 14:07.411
- That's enough, Mr. Patton.

14:08.891 --> 14:12.286
Mr. Stone, I'm granting
your request for remand.

14:12.329 --> 14:15.550
- Your Honor.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.035
- Peter Stone.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.601
Claire Newbury.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.908
I interviewed
your father years ago.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.041
I've written three books
on Infinity.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.520
- Sorry, I never read them.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.392
- Oh, but you must have been
interested in his cases.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.741
Your father's white whale.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.438
- Look is there something
I can help you with?

14:34.482 --> 14:36.353
- I'm working
on my fourth book.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.313
I've already set up
an interview with Mr. Patton.

14:39.356 --> 14:42.925
I mean, the psychological,
mental state of that guy

14:42.969 --> 14:46.102
has got to be fascinating
in--in its own weird way.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.582
- Take your word for it.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.758
- I was also hoping that
I could interview you,

14:49.801 --> 14:51.586
what it was like growing up
with a father

14:51.629 --> 14:53.805
obsessed with a psychopath
he couldn't bring to justice.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.460
- Like I said, my father and I
never discussed his cases.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.028
I wouldn't have anything
to tell you.

14:59.072 --> 15:02.249
- Well, maybe you'll
change your mind.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.642
- I won't.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.123
- What's Patton's defense
gonna be?

15:07.167 --> 15:08.603
The guy confessed.
We got forensics.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.953
- Well, never underestimate
a public defender

15:10.997 --> 15:12.607
looking for his moment
in the sun.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.174
The letter found
in Patton's house,

15:14.217 --> 15:15.784
was it authenticated?

15:15.827 --> 15:18.613
- Handwriting analysis matched
those received by the NYPD.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.093
- Do we know
where Patton got it?

15:20.136 --> 15:22.095
- Criminal memorabilia
black market.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.444
A dealer bought it
from a detective

15:23.487 --> 15:25.446
who was working
the Infinity case in the '80s.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.013
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.363
- Wow.
both: Thank you.

15:29.406 --> 15:33.106
- You know,
Infinity wrote about me.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.152
Look at this.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.635
"Your son throws the ball
like he was born for it."

15:40.678 --> 15:42.811
June 1988.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.509
I would have been seven.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.644
- He staked out
your Little League games?

15:49.687 --> 15:51.298
Hold on, that photo
of you and your father,

15:51.341 --> 15:54.301
do you--do you think Infinity
might have taken that?

15:54.344 --> 15:55.867
- You know, my dad sent me
and my sister

15:55.911 --> 15:58.740
to live with my Aunt Carolyn
in Montana that summer.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.742
Dropped us off
and said, "Be back soon."

16:00.785 --> 16:02.439
Three months later,
not a word.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.006
My aunt had to put us
on a plane

16:04.050 --> 16:05.486
so we wouldn't miss school.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.054
I always resented him
for that.

16:08.097 --> 16:11.579
- Sounds like he might have
been trying to protect you.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.888
- Hey.
Hey, excuse me?

16:16.932 --> 16:19.674
Can you turn this up?

16:19.717 --> 16:23.417
- Mr. Patton, you claim to be

16:23.460 --> 16:26.986
the infamous Infinity rapist.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.204
- Yes.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.597
You should know that.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.468
You wrote three books on me.

16:31.512 --> 16:34.080
- You realize Infinity--
if he's even still alive--

16:34.123 --> 16:37.997
would be well into
his 60s by now, if not 70s.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.520
An old man.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.478
- That's why the world needs
a new Infinity.

16:41.522 --> 16:44.046
That's why I'm Infinity now.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.185
- What you got?

16:52.228 --> 16:53.708
- Claire Newbury
and her husband, Leo.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.710
He was tied up,
plates stacked on his back.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.625
She was raped,
he's having chest pains.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.844
- Claire Newbury, the writer?
She--she was just on the news.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.282
- Better go upstairs.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.728
- Another copycat?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.512
- Or we just baited
the real Infinity

17:15.556 --> 17:18.254
out of retirement.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.095
- It was him.
I am absolutely positive.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.401
- Did he say anything?

17:34.444 --> 17:37.360
- He said,
"I'm alive, you bitch."

17:37.404 --> 17:39.014
Obviously he saw me
on the news.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.756
- Do you have any idea how
he got into your apartment?

17:41.799 --> 17:44.019
- He must have followed us in
from the street.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.934
Leo had his key
in the front door,

17:45.977 --> 17:48.023
and suddenly he was just there.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.112
Ski mask, gloves.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.592
He had a knife.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.334
I wanted to fight, to scream,
but Leo said no.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.118
We would do whatever he wanted.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.206
We didn't want to die.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.729
- What happened next?

17:58.773 --> 18:01.515
- He put the knife
to Leo's throat.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.126
He had me tie him up,
stack the plates,

18:04.170 --> 18:06.998
everything the way
I had researched.

18:07.042 --> 18:10.480
Exactly the way I knew
he would behave.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.788
He took me into the bedroom.

18:13.831 --> 18:17.008
Then he tied me up
and he raped me.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.797
And he told me to moan
like I was enjoying it.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.842
- We're so sorry, Ms. Newbury.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.236
- Did you get a sense
of his age?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.457
- He was an old man.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
He had old man breath.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.161
My husband is still
in the hospital.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.684
He is too old for this!

18:40.728 --> 18:42.686
I'm too old for this!

18:42.730 --> 18:45.167
He comes back!
That's what he does!

18:45.211 --> 18:48.214
What if he comes back?

18:52.609 --> 18:54.133
- I want this son of a bitch.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.265
- Listen, we have
every available officer

18:56.309 --> 18:57.484
working overtime.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.050
We're pulling street cams,

18:59.094 --> 19:02.053
we're pulling security cams
from every bodega, bank,

19:02.097 --> 19:03.664
and lobby
on the Upper East Side.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.274
- All right, was there
anything else at the scene?

19:05.318 --> 19:07.146
A partial print, a hair,
a fiber?

19:07.189 --> 19:09.278
- CSU is going over that house
with a fine-toothed comb.

19:09.322 --> 19:11.498
We're just--we're waiting
on the rape kit.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.803
- She said he was careful.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.240
He wore a condom,
a ski mask, and gloves.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.155
- He was careful,
but with the advancements

19:16.198 --> 19:17.199
in DNA technology--

19:17.243 --> 19:19.810
- All right, what about
the letters?

19:19.854 --> 19:22.291
The lab...

19:22.335 --> 19:24.424
it checked the letter that
we found at Patton's office.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.990
There's no DNA.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.644
Look, there's--there's
nothing else on evidence.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.863
- All right,
Patton had that letter

19:28.906 --> 19:30.386
in his desk for years.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.474
There could be others
out there

19:31.518 --> 19:33.563
that we don't know about.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.217
- Patton got the letter

19:35.261 --> 19:38.655
from a dealer
on the Lower East Side.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.918
We can start there.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.790
- Good.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.186
- Hello?

19:48.752 --> 19:50.972
- Anybody here?

19:51.015 --> 19:51.799
- Yeah!

19:51.842 --> 19:53.888
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

19:53.931 --> 19:57.326
Whatever you guys are
looking for, I got it all.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.545
- NYPD.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.068
We need to ask you
a few questions.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.679
- Well, all this stuff in here

20:02.723 --> 20:04.420
is perfectly legal, Officer.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.639
I swear.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.684
- You did business
with Karl Patton?

20:07.728 --> 20:09.512
- The copycat.

20:09.556 --> 20:10.905
Yeah.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.863
- So you knew he was
an Infinity freak?

20:12.907 --> 20:15.344
- I knew he was a kook.

20:15.388 --> 20:19.261
I had no idea he'd actually
go out and rape someone.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
- Yeah, no way you could
anticipate that.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.351
That's fair enough.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.527
Problem is,
you're still guilty.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.789
- Guilty of what?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.269
- Trafficking
stolen merchandise

20:27.313 --> 20:28.575
from the NYPD.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.839
- This was 30 years ago,
for God sakes.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
Now, you can't prove anything.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.148
- Oh, we can subpoena
your business records.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.107
We can subpoena
your tax records.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.804
We can hold you up in court
for years.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.285
- I run a legit operation.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.678
- Legit, huh?

20:44.721 --> 20:45.853
Then you'll have no problem
giving us receipts

20:45.896 --> 20:48.116
for every item in this store.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.814
Certificates of authenticity,
certificates of provenance.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.512
- This is a shakedown.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.384
- Bingo.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.734
- Okay, what do you want?

20:57.778 --> 20:59.954
- Anything
and everything Infinity.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.826
- Back room stuff.
All of it.

21:04.001 --> 21:07.178
- What's mine is yours.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.487
- The lab actually pulled DNA
from Infinity memorabilia?

21:11.531 --> 21:13.446
- Saliva residue from a stamp.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.099
A letter mailed back in '83.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.753
- Back before Infinity
got careful.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.842
- Yeah, the bad news is,
there's no hits in CODIS.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.801
I'm starting to understand

21:20.844 --> 21:21.802
how my father must have felt.

21:21.845 --> 21:22.977
- Hey, sorry to interrupt,

21:23.020 --> 21:24.718
but the, uh, DNA
from the stamp?

21:24.761 --> 21:26.067
I got a hit.
- How?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.547
- I thought there was nothing
in CODIS?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.636
- From learnmylineage.com.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.726
- You sent Infinity's DNA
to a genealogy website?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.162
- It was a shot in the dark.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.468
I figured it was easier
to ask your forgiveness

21:35.511 --> 21:38.514
than your permission.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.950
- And?

21:39.994 --> 21:42.605
- I got a familial hit.
A close female relative.

21:42.649 --> 21:43.998
She's got an address
in Brooklyn,

21:44.041 --> 21:45.565
and she gave the site
permission to contact her

21:45.608 --> 21:46.914
with any matches.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.395
So now I'm, uh--
I'm asking your permission.

21:49.438 --> 21:52.223
- Go, run with it.
Go.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.535
- Amy Gardner?
- Yeah.

21:59.579 --> 22:00.623
- I'm Detective
Dominick Carisi.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.929
This is Sergeant Tutuola.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.452
- What's this about?

22:03.496 --> 22:05.149
- We're hoping
you could help us.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.500
- Last year you sent in
a DNA sample

22:07.543 --> 22:09.371
to learnmylineage.com?

22:09.415 --> 22:12.505
- I guess I got sucked in
by the TV ads for Father's Day.

22:12.548 --> 22:16.726
- We do need to talk to you
about your male relatives.

22:16.770 --> 22:17.988
- You're serious.

22:18.032 --> 22:20.121
- It's important.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.863
- Then I guess
you'd better come in.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.735
- Thank you.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.222
- So you're saying that one
of my relatives is a criminal?

22:34.265 --> 22:35.310
- The DNA match
could be a relative

22:35.354 --> 22:36.964
you didn't even know you had.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.619
- That must be it, because both
of my parents are dead.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.969
I don't have any cousins
or brothers.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.101
I mean, I have a little sister.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.451
She lives in San Francisco.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.627
- No, this relative
will be a male.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.064
- An older male.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.066
- Uncle Edgar?

22:52.109 --> 22:53.415
My mom's big brother.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.765
- How old is Uncle Edgar?

22:55.809 --> 22:57.114
- Sixty-eight.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.638
- He lives in New York?

22:58.681 --> 22:59.726
- His whole life.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.423
He worked as
a cable repair man.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.817
He retired a few years ago
when his wife died.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.732
- When did he get married?

23:05.775 --> 23:08.648
- I think it was '94?

23:10.824 --> 23:12.739
He's the sweetest man
in the world.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.349
What do you think he did?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.090
- We're gonna need
his address.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.439
- I don't think I should.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.093
Is what you're doing
even legal?

23:19.136 --> 23:20.486
- We're gonna talk
to your uncle

23:20.529 --> 23:24.185
whether you give us
his address or not.

23:24.228 --> 23:26.100
- You're making a mistake.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.932
- Go, I'll stay.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.324
- You're not going with him?

23:33.368 --> 23:35.588
- I need to wait here.
I'm sorry.

23:35.631 --> 23:39.592
- To make sure I don't call
Uncle Edgar.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.119
- He's not here.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.468
Super said he left
on a bodega run

23:46.512 --> 23:47.774
about an hour ago.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.428
- Okay, are we sure
this is the right address?

23:49.471 --> 23:50.994
- Edgar Noone, 68.

23:51.038 --> 23:54.041
Lived here with his wife
before she passed for 20 years.

23:54.084 --> 23:56.043
- Edgar, how you doing?

23:56.086 --> 23:58.001
- Fin.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.918
- On it.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.923
Edgar Noone.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.272
- Yes?

24:08.316 --> 24:10.144
What's this about?

24:10.187 --> 24:12.146
- NYPD.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.583
- Mr. Noone,
put your groceries down.

24:14.627 --> 24:17.847
Put your hands
where we can see them.

24:17.891 --> 24:20.502
You need to come with us.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.985
Let's go.

24:35.691 --> 24:36.779
- Excuse me.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.781
Hey, Lieu.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.523
Okay, that's great.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.699
Thanks.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.834
Your uncle's in custody.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.619
- What did he do?

24:50.663 --> 24:52.969
- Do you remember
the Infinity Rapist?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.580
Of the '80s and '90s?

24:54.623 --> 24:57.017
- Yeah.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.801
- Well, your uncle's age,

24:58.845 --> 25:01.412
the timing of the assaults,
plus the DNA--

25:01.456 --> 25:02.805
- No, I don't believe it.

25:02.849 --> 25:05.112
I'm getting him a lawyer.
I know how this works.

25:05.155 --> 25:08.028
- That's your right.
He's entitled to a defense.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.821
- Rush it.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.431
- We're on it.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.998
- Now what happens?

25:22.042 --> 25:23.522
- We wait for the DNA match

25:23.565 --> 25:27.482
and then we arrest you
for 23 rapes.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.179
- I'm not Infinity.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.660
- Let's agree to disagree.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.140
- You're pretty confident.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.316
- Oh, I'm very confident...

25:35.359 --> 25:37.448
that if we had the wrong man,

25:37.492 --> 25:38.885
you wouldn't be so calm.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.844
See, we have police files
going back decades.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.586
Dates, times, places.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.414
And those apartments
are gonna be

25:46.457 --> 25:48.198
on your cable repair route.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.200
And you won't have an alibi.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.593
- We got the knives.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.464
We got the rope you planted,

25:53.508 --> 25:55.945
which you used
to tie up your victims.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.556
- Infinity wore gloves.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.471
- Well, we'll find
touch DNA somewhere.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.212
- Infinity's too smart.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.824
- Infinity's so smart,
why'd he come out of retirement

26:04.867 --> 26:06.477
and rape Claire Newbury?

26:06.521 --> 26:09.437
- The case was cold.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.308
He would have
gotten away with it.

26:11.352 --> 26:12.919
- Maybe....

26:12.962 --> 26:16.313
he didn't want the world
to think he was dead.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.315
- Now you get to go
to prison for life.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.232
- There's ADA Stone now.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.759
- Look who I ran into
in the lobby.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.413
- No more questions
for my client.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.894
- You're Ben Stone's son,
aren't you?

26:34.375 --> 26:35.855
- Yeah.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.552
Yeah, I am.
Why'd you ask?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.946
- I said no more questions.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.475
- Noone's DNA matched the DNA
on the back of the stamp

26:47.518 --> 26:49.346
and Claire Newbury made
a voice ID.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.783
- That's just enough
for an arrest warrant

26:50.826 --> 26:51.784
for the one rape.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.394
- What about
the 22 other rapes?

26:53.437 --> 26:54.656
- Well, defense will argue
that Noone may have

26:54.700 --> 26:56.179
licked the stamp
and mailed the letter,

26:56.223 --> 26:57.528
but that doesn't prove
he's Infinity.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.095
What about the apartment?
Any trophies?

26:59.139 --> 27:00.793
- No, now we're going through
his financials.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.272
Maybe he's got
a storage unit somewhere.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.665
- Does his niece know anything?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.406
- Nah, to her,
he's just a sweet uncle.

27:05.449 --> 27:06.842
- What about the profile
you sent the website?

27:06.886 --> 27:08.496
- Uh, I used my name.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.280
- Relax, the guys who caught
Golden State

27:10.324 --> 27:11.673
did not identify themselves
as police.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.153
Now, I did the research
on this,

27:13.196 --> 27:16.025
and there is legal precedent
in California and Florida.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.331
- Yeah, but not New York,

27:17.374 --> 27:19.202
which is what defense
will argue.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.464
- This just came for you.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.032
- Thanks.

27:23.859 --> 27:26.645
Defense motion to exclude
Noone's DNA.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.820
- Eh, good for them,

27:27.863 --> 27:29.691
but on this one
the law's on our side.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.563
- Let's hope a judge thinks so.

27:34.391 --> 27:35.784
- The familial DNA

27:35.828 --> 27:37.394
which led police to my client

27:37.438 --> 27:39.527
was obtained without
a valid court order.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.703
- The genealogy website
willingly complied.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.662
- Based on assumption
of identity.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.577
NYPD did not
identify themselves.

27:46.621 --> 27:47.840
- Which is not illegal.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.842
- Was the website public?
- Private.

27:49.885 --> 27:53.019
And while my client's niece
agreed to being contacted

27:53.062 --> 27:55.108
by familial matches,
she did not agree

27:55.151 --> 27:58.372
to law enforcement
having access to her DNA.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.722
Katz versus United States.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.725
Supreme Court ruled in favor
of protections

28:03.769 --> 28:05.379
of intrusions of privacy.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.207
- With exception
for exigent circumstances.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.775
We believe Edgar Noone
is the Infinity Rapist.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.733
To allow him the opportunity
to escape

28:11.777 --> 28:13.517
would have been putting
the entire population

28:13.561 --> 28:15.215
of New York City
in imminent danger.

28:15.258 --> 28:18.566
- There are serious
Fourth Amendment issues here.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.090
If we go down this road,
what's next?

28:21.134 --> 28:22.439
Police state?

28:22.483 --> 28:24.659
A mandatory universal
DNA database?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.052
- I see your point.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.750
Mr. Stone, do you have
any other evidence

28:28.794 --> 28:31.013
linking Mr. Noone
to these crimes?

28:31.057 --> 28:32.536
- Yes, Your Honor.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.842
The last victim made a positive
voice identification.

28:33.886 --> 28:36.323
- And that is also tainted.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.238
- I have to agree.

28:38.281 --> 28:39.892
As all the evidence in the case

28:39.935 --> 28:41.850
is fruit of the poisonous tree,

28:41.894 --> 28:44.374
I grant the motion to dismiss.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.420
- Your Honor, this monster

28:46.463 --> 28:49.075
is guilty of 23 rapes.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.467
You dismiss now, we lose

28:50.511 --> 28:52.252
any chance of justice
for those victims.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.775
- I feel your pain, Mr. Stone,

28:53.819 --> 28:55.472
but the evidence
doesn't support

28:55.516 --> 28:56.996
the pending indictment.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.302
I am putting the case over
for a new indictment.

28:59.346 --> 29:03.132
In the mean time, Mr. Noone,
you're free to go.

29:15.405 --> 29:18.495
- Your father would have
done better.

29:30.638 --> 29:31.944
- Hey.

29:31.987 --> 29:32.945
- Hey, thank you
for meeting me.

29:32.988 --> 29:34.250
- Yeah, of course.

29:34.294 --> 29:38.124
I was, uh--I was surprised
that you called.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.954
- My uncle hasn't
called me back.

29:43.216 --> 29:46.175
- What do you think that means?

29:47.220 --> 29:50.005
- DNA doesn't lie, does it?

29:54.270 --> 29:55.881
Oh, God.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.187
Oh, my God.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.668
He used to pick me up
from school,

30:00.711 --> 30:01.669
take me to the park.

30:01.712 --> 30:04.237
How is this possible?

30:08.763 --> 30:11.157
- Amy...

30:11.200 --> 30:14.595
is--is there anything else

30:14.638 --> 30:17.467
that you can tell me
about your uncle?

30:17.511 --> 30:18.904
Anything at all.

30:18.947 --> 30:21.515
- I...

30:23.125 --> 30:26.607
He stayed with us
for a few months.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.783
I was six.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.613
He would wake up in the middle
of the night screaming...

30:34.006 --> 30:36.704
"I can't listen, make it stop!"

30:38.053 --> 30:41.535
Years later, my mom told me
about her and Edgar's parents.

30:41.578 --> 30:42.797
They were alcoholics.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.148
They were always fighting
and...

30:46.192 --> 30:48.237
some nights my grandfather

30:48.281 --> 30:51.197
would lock my mother
and Edgar in their room.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.896
Told them not to make a sound.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.638
- What happened
on those nights?

30:58.900 --> 31:01.163
- She said that...

31:01.207 --> 31:03.774
my grandfather
did horrible things

31:03.818 --> 31:07.082
to my grandmother.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.693
I think he raped her.

31:11.695 --> 31:15.656
- And he made your mother
and Edgar listen, didn't he?

31:25.361 --> 31:27.363
- So my father was tortured
by a man

31:27.407 --> 31:29.278
who was tortured
by his own father?

31:29.322 --> 31:30.149
- Uh-huh.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.107
Probably too little too late.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.674
- Maybe not.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.242
Noone sent over a dozen
"Dear Ben" letters.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.635
They were taunting.
They were full of detail.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.072
- He--he wanted to be caught.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.683
- Yeah, or he wanted
to confess...

31:42.726 --> 31:45.164
to Ben Stone.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.687
See, he saw him
as a father figure.

31:46.730 --> 31:47.906
Look.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.691
He even sent him
a Father's Day card.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.437
- Okay, um...

31:57.480 --> 31:58.960
we gotta find a way
to get this guy back

31:59.004 --> 32:01.745
in the interrogation room.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.664
- You arrested him for driving
on a suspended license?

32:07.708 --> 32:08.970
- An old guy?

32:09.014 --> 32:10.841
Who knew he had
unpaid speeding tickets?

32:10.885 --> 32:12.800
- He hasn't asked
for a lawyer?

32:12.843 --> 32:14.715
- Not yet.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.151
- And he'll talk to us?

32:16.195 --> 32:19.676
- He'll talk to my father.

32:21.896 --> 32:25.204
- "Dear Ben, I was thinking
about you last night.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.248
Wondering about Mary."

32:26.292 --> 32:27.858
- Mary Harris.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.991
Infinity's 22nd victim.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.210
- "Wondering if Mary
would tell you

32:31.253 --> 32:32.254
"what I did to her.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.908
"What I made her say.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.431
"If she would get
the details right

32:35.475 --> 32:36.955
"or if she would leave out
the interesting parts

32:36.998 --> 32:38.304
because she was ashamed."

32:38.347 --> 32:40.523
- Infinity had a way
with words.

32:40.567 --> 32:43.700
- That's probably what made him
interesting to Ben Stone.

32:43.744 --> 32:44.745
- Yeah.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.877
My father studied him.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.532
He read and reread the letters,

32:49.576 --> 32:52.927
looking for clues about--
about the crimes.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.233
His life.

32:54.276 --> 32:57.323
About his traumatic childhood.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.194
- What do you mean?

32:59.238 --> 33:01.980
- As a boy,
Infinity was forced to listen

33:02.023 --> 33:05.157
while his father
raped his mother.

33:06.462 --> 33:09.422
- Explains the pathology,
but...

33:09.465 --> 33:12.120
I don't think any of that
was in the books.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.383
- And--and Ben Stone knew that?

33:14.427 --> 33:16.385
- Oh, my father was obsessed.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.083
I mean, he kept everything.

33:18.126 --> 33:19.910
I mean, look,
letter after letter.

33:19.954 --> 33:23.610
Infinity even sent him
a Father's Day card one year.

33:25.699 --> 33:27.875
Look.

33:29.268 --> 33:32.227
- "Dear Ben,
happy Father's Day."

33:32.271 --> 33:35.578
Signed with
the infinity symbol.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.329
Take a look.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.724
- Ben Stone kept this?

33:50.767 --> 33:53.248
- Yeah, he did.

33:53.292 --> 33:54.771
He kept it in an evidence file

33:54.815 --> 33:56.730
so it wouldn't get smudged
or torn.

33:59.689 --> 34:03.606
- Of course, the idiot,
he sent a card with golf clubs.

34:05.434 --> 34:08.568
My father never played a game
of golf in his life.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.443
- Infinity couldn't
have known that--

34:14.487 --> 34:15.705
- Right.

34:15.749 --> 34:18.273
Because he knew nothing
about my father.

34:18.317 --> 34:19.535
- They had a relationship.

34:19.579 --> 34:22.016
- There was no relationship.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.150
- All those hours Ben Stone
spent on the case?

34:25.193 --> 34:26.716
He spent more time
with Infinity

34:26.760 --> 34:28.457
than he did
with his own family!

34:28.501 --> 34:31.460
- Ben Stone cared about
the women who were raped.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.420
He cared about getting justice
for them.

34:34.463 --> 34:35.725
You're a little confused.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.205
- If you think this was
about you,

34:37.249 --> 34:39.120
you're more insane
than I thought.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.557
- No!

34:42.732 --> 34:44.734
That's not true!

34:44.778 --> 34:47.563
I know!

34:54.048 --> 34:56.572
- You know what?

35:08.280 --> 35:11.413
I would wait outside
the DA's office

35:11.457 --> 35:14.982
until the light
in his office went out.

35:15.025 --> 35:18.072
Some nights, he wouldn't even
get in his car

35:18.116 --> 35:20.509
until after midnight.

35:20.553 --> 35:23.164
It was me he cared about.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.123
Not you.

35:27.777 --> 35:30.040
Me!

35:30.084 --> 35:33.305
It was me he loved!

36:01.811 --> 36:05.424
- He's going to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.950
Your father
would be proud, Peter.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.433
- I, uh...

36:14.476 --> 36:17.479
I found this
in my father's notes.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.048
Uh, "Peter's game today.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.703
Don't be late.
He's the starting pitcher."

36:25.487 --> 36:26.836
I was in junior high.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.230
It was the first game
of the season.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.406
He never showed.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.627
I hit a homer
in the last inning.

36:37.673 --> 36:40.459
I went home and, uh...

36:40.502 --> 36:42.548
I could tell he wanted to talk,
but I was so angry

36:42.591 --> 36:45.551
I just went to my room.

36:47.030 --> 36:51.034
I'll never forget
the disappointment in his eyes.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.776
- You were a teenager.

36:53.820 --> 36:54.647
- Yeah.

36:54.690 --> 36:56.823
The next day he wrote this:

36:56.866 --> 36:58.520
Uh...

36:58.564 --> 37:01.001
"Peter's team won.

37:01.958 --> 37:05.048
Maybe he'll
forgive me someday."

37:07.486 --> 37:10.271
We never talked
about that game.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.795
It was September '93.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.976
Turns out...

37:20.020 --> 37:23.197
Infinity had struck again
the night before.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.901
- Peter.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.432
It's time to forgive him.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.314
- Yeah.

38:04.369 --> 38:07.372
- Thank you, Lucy.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.201
- Why are you home early?

38:11.245 --> 38:14.117
- I thought we'd spend
a little time together.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.555
- I want Lucy.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.863
Okay, so, uh...

38:20.907 --> 38:22.952
Noah, we all get
in bad moods sometimes,

38:22.996 --> 38:24.563
and that's okay.

38:24.606 --> 38:27.348
And sometimes
it's not about Lucy

38:27.392 --> 38:30.873
or olives or homework.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.222
Right?

38:32.266 --> 38:35.400
It means that we're upset
about something else.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.582
What's wrong, honey?
You can tell me.

38:46.411 --> 38:49.588
Noah?
Tell me.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.332
- It's Jeremy.

38:54.375 --> 38:57.247
He keeps asking
where my dad is.

38:57.291 --> 38:59.162
I told him he's in heaven.

39:02.427 --> 39:03.906
- That's right, Noah.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.387
He is.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.998
- Did he love me?

39:10.391 --> 39:13.263
- Oh, sweetheart.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.962
Honey, of course he did.

39:16.005 --> 39:18.921
Very, very, very much.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.621
And...

39:22.664 --> 39:24.231
someday, when you get older,

39:24.274 --> 39:28.104
I promise you I'm gonna
tell you all about him.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.368
But for right now, it's just--

39:30.411 --> 39:33.588
it's just Team You and Me.

39:33.632 --> 39:36.591
And I feel...

39:37.549 --> 39:40.943
So very lucky
to be on that team.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.167
- Me too.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.002
- I love you, honey.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.701
One sec.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.056
Peter, hey.
Something about the case?

40:07.100 --> 40:10.320
- Actually, I'm not here
to talk to you.

40:10.364 --> 40:11.974
- Coach!
- Hey.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.107
I thought maybe Noah and me
could play a game of catch.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.414
- Can I play catch?
Please, Mom?

40:16.457 --> 40:18.372
- Uh, sure you can.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.635
There you go.

40:20.679 --> 40:21.941
- Yeah.
- Hey, thanks.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.333
Come on, slugger.
- Let's go!

40:23.377 --> 40:24.465
- Shoes.
- Hey, grab your coat!

40:24.509 --> 40:26.162
- And coat.
Here you go.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.077
All right, come on, come on.
Get those shoes on.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.470
- Go, go, go.
- Yeah, that'll work.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.906
That'll work.
Come on, big guy.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.647
Nice one.
All right, put these on.

40:32.691 --> 40:33.648
All right, you ready?

40:33.692 --> 40:36.042
- Let's go.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.610
- Thank you.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.221
Thank you.
