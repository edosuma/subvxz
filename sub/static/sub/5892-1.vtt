01:40.370 --> 01:41.531
Okay.

02:13.730 --> 02:15.255
Not again.

03:35.490 --> 03:37.652
This is not real.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.710
- Ready?
- Yup.

06:39.810 --> 06:41.190
Okay.

06:41.290 --> 06:44.390
We're at the Heller household,
August 12.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.910
Subject claimed sightings
of true apparition.

06:47.010 --> 06:48.990
We're gonna do an EVP scan,

06:49.090 --> 06:52.333
check for possible recurrence,
spontaneous psychokinesis.

07:24.650 --> 07:27.256
Heard a few things. Could be DVP's.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.340
What?

07:53.970 --> 07:55.670
- What is it?
- Shh.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.580
Miguel.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.135
Miguel.

08:04.090 --> 08:05.590
Stop it. You're scaring me.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.270
What? What did you see?

08:28.370 --> 08:29.860
We need to leave.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.590
- You saw something, didn't you?
- Let us get out.

08:31.690 --> 08:33.789
Please. Look. Help me!
Tell me what you saw.

08:33.890 --> 08:35.460
I'm s... I'm sorry.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.550
All right, guys. Have a good day.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.030
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:52.130 --> 08:54.590
Hey, love bugs. How was camp?

08:54.690 --> 08:56.658
- Great!
- It was?

08:59.210 --> 09:01.133
Who was that?

09:02.090 --> 09:03.550
It's no one.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.230
They found something, didn't they?

09:05.330 --> 09:07.537
Jake, Mrs. Wallace
is coming over in an hour.

09:07.650 --> 09:10.150
- Again? That was over five months ago.
- We talked about this.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.740
Can I draw the menu for dinner?

09:11.850 --> 09:13.270
Oh, would you please?

09:13.370 --> 09:14.910
Video game time?

09:15.010 --> 09:16.819
Half an hour, but like basketball,
none of that...

09:48.810 --> 09:50.414
You're scaring Mom.

09:58.370 --> 09:59.830
- Hi.
- Hello, Ms. Heller.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.534
Hi. Come on in.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.618
Again, you can call me Madison.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.630
- Is Jacob in his room?
- Yeah. I'll go get him.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.110
That's okay.
I'd like to speak to him there.

10:08.210 --> 10:09.780
You know the way.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.510
Knock, knock.

10:24.610 --> 10:27.510
- Hi, Mrs. Wallace.
- How are you, Jacob?

10:27.610 --> 10:29.630
Okay. I mean, good.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.255
How's camp?

10:33.330 --> 10:37.150
Have you given any thought to what we
talked about in our last conversation?

10:37.250 --> 10:38.695
I still feel bad about what happened,

10:38.810 --> 10:41.830
but I don't really remember it.

10:41.930 --> 10:43.830
It's been nearly six months.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.217
We talked about you writing a letter.

10:48.770 --> 10:50.613
I didn't mean to hurt him. I just...

10:53.330 --> 10:56.150
I just couldn't stop myself.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.651
I don't know what I would write
other than "I'm sorry."

11:00.250 --> 11:03.350
Jacob, you need to take responsibility.

11:03.450 --> 11:05.373
I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

11:09.490 --> 11:12.470
Hey. You know,
people who do bad things...

11:12.570 --> 11:14.095
aren't always bad people.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.659
- How was it?
- Good.

11:22.770 --> 11:25.270
He seems to be adjusting.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.350
He's been doing really well this summer.

11:27.450 --> 11:30.670
He's getting along really well
with his tutor.

11:30.770 --> 11:33.030
I've never seen him this engaged.

11:33.130 --> 11:35.212
That's good. And how's
the rest of the home?

11:36.490 --> 11:38.390
It's okay.

11:38.490 --> 11:42.430
But, you know, it's been tough.

11:42.530 --> 11:43.990
We're getting there.

11:44.090 --> 11:48.350
Well. One more visit,
and then I can file my report.

11:48.450 --> 11:50.179
Then you can move on.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.501
Thank you.

12:15.730 --> 12:17.300
Let 'er rip.

12:18.810 --> 12:20.221
- Now the other one with the same...
- Velocity.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.890
- Meaning they...
- Have the same momentum.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.590
Excellent.

12:26.690 --> 12:28.190
Now if they both have the same momentum,

12:28.290 --> 12:30.310
why do we have such
dramatically different results?

12:30.410 --> 12:34.390
Well, the wall applies a bigger
stopping force over a shorter time.

12:34.490 --> 12:35.950
Good. And the sheet?

12:36.050 --> 12:38.590
The sheet has a smaller stopping force,
but over a longer period.

12:38.690 --> 12:41.070
You got it. They both stop the eggs,

12:41.170 --> 12:43.790
and they both decelerate
the egg's momentum to zero, but...

12:43.890 --> 12:47.430
But it takes a smaller force to decelerate
the egg's momentum over time.

12:47.530 --> 12:50.030
In fact, so much smaller...

12:50.130 --> 12:52.750
that the eggshell barely even cracks.

12:52.850 --> 12:56.750
Good work today. You get to do all kinds
of stuff like this in ninth grade physics.

12:56.850 --> 12:59.110
- Yeah.
- What?

12:59.210 --> 13:01.910
Still not excited about surging past
all your classmates?

13:02.010 --> 13:04.830
No, it's just that it's gonna be weird.

13:04.930 --> 13:07.092
Gonna be so much younger than them.

13:07.210 --> 13:09.270
You know, same thing happened to me?

13:09.370 --> 13:11.630
And if I can do it, I know you can.

13:11.730 --> 13:14.430
Hey. We're not too early?

13:14.530 --> 13:15.990
No. No problem at all.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.550
We're just winding things down actually.

13:17.650 --> 13:20.051
Hey, bud.

13:20.170 --> 13:21.660
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.310
Sam's e-mail, about the budget?

13:25.410 --> 13:28.790
Yeah. But at least she signed it with
a "Thanks!" this time.

13:28.890 --> 13:31.630
Yeah. There's more kids
this year, less resources.

13:31.730 --> 13:34.150
Think I'm gonna have to
bring my eggs from home.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.747
It's nice to meet you.

13:37.090 --> 13:39.430
Uh, his name's Jon Bone Jovi.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.350
No kid will ever get that joke.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.510
Some might.

13:43.610 --> 13:45.910
Jon Bone Jovi.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.535
Mom, can we go?

13:48.610 --> 13:51.420
Sorry. Famished child here.

13:54.890 --> 13:58.178
Tomorrow night, then?
I could also come tonight.

13:59.610 --> 14:00.670
Hurry.

14:00.770 --> 14:02.295
Tomorrow night.

14:04.050 --> 14:05.190
Go!

14:05.290 --> 14:07.691
Better run!

14:07.810 --> 14:09.460
Here I come!

14:30.650 --> 14:33.051
Okay, guys. Playtime,
and we sit down for dinner in an hour.

14:33.170 --> 14:34.150
Yay!

14:34.250 --> 14:35.979
I heard you scream last night.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.860
It was a bad dream.

14:39.970 --> 14:41.813
Mom, you know we have to
get out of that house...

14:41.930 --> 14:43.550
Don't scare your sister.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.150
I'm not scared.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.510
Mom, I've heard her talking to it.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.055
I'm working on it.

14:49.170 --> 14:50.899
- I know, but just...
- Honey, not now.

14:52.610 --> 14:54.339
How was your lesson?

14:56.490 --> 14:58.413
Nick tells me that
you're doing really good.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.990
When he was over the other night?

15:00.090 --> 15:02.013
I think he's nice.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.855
I think he's nice too.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.815
Wee!

17:30.010 --> 17:33.093
It's gonna go away. It's gonna go away.

18:08.450 --> 18:11.590
- Go back to sleep.
- I heard something in the kitchen.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.670
It's fine. Just go to sleep.

18:13.770 --> 18:17.092
Here. Put this on your cut.
But hold your breath.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.372
Do you think it was Dad?

18:28.530 --> 18:30.020
It wasn't Dad.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.470
About yesterday?

18:44.570 --> 18:47.414
I didn't mean to cut you off,
but I don't want to scare Hales.

18:49.050 --> 18:51.132
If you want to talk, I'm here.

18:55.770 --> 18:57.550
Hey.

18:57.650 --> 19:00.256
If something is bothering you,
I want you to tell me.

19:01.890 --> 19:05.690
I could sell my comics if you think
that would help us get out of here.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.659
Okay. That's really sweet.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.260
But I'm handling it.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.550
I need you to trust me.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.414
It's just that when Dad...

19:18.890 --> 19:20.950
You like Hales's costume?

19:21.050 --> 19:23.132
It's almost as good as last week's.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.821
- Those wings are gonna fall off, you know.
- No, they're not.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.655
Enough?

19:31.410 --> 19:33.333
Big spiders.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.616
Hey. Come here.

19:40.690 --> 19:43.150
All right. I want you
to have fun at camp.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.270
Okay? I'm gonna pick you up at 4:00.

19:45.370 --> 19:47.270
I need you to watch Hales
for a little bit tonight.

19:47.370 --> 19:48.950
- Yeah.
- Bye.

19:49.050 --> 19:50.131
Bye.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.070
Hi.

20:14.170 --> 20:15.910
My name is Austin Hamilton.

20:16.010 --> 20:18.616
I'm a representative
of Pacific Land Holdings.

20:20.490 --> 20:23.230
I know who you are.
I've got your letters.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.412
Great. So you know why I'm here.

20:26.210 --> 20:27.894
That is a lovely garden.

20:31.490 --> 20:33.670
Money's been... a little tight.

20:33.770 --> 20:36.070
Yeah, Ms. Heller,
I don't think you understand.

20:36.170 --> 20:38.590
But I've been authorized
to make an offer on your property,

20:38.690 --> 20:40.374
buy out your existing mortgage.

20:41.970 --> 20:43.710
Do me a favor, though.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.430
Don't tell your neighbors, because, uh,
the number we're offering you...

20:47.530 --> 20:50.659
is substantially higher than the open
market prices we're offering them.

20:51.930 --> 20:54.390
- Why?
- Well, over the next 10 years,

20:54.490 --> 20:56.750
we plan on expanding in this area,
and your land...

20:56.850 --> 20:58.773
well, that's an important
part of the process.

21:00.170 --> 21:02.550
Uh... What if I choose not to sell?

21:02.650 --> 21:07.430
Hmm. Well, you do know that CamSET
Holdings owns the mortgage on your home.

21:07.530 --> 21:10.630
You're behind on your payments,
and foreclosure...

21:10.730 --> 21:15.030
Oh. That could affect your ability
to send your kids to college or...

21:15.130 --> 21:17.030
Well, I would need to see
a number first.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.790
Of course. Yeah. Of course. Here.

21:18.890 --> 21:21.257
Why don't you take that?

21:21.370 --> 21:25.270
We'll get the ball rolling and have you
and your family out of here in no time.

21:25.370 --> 21:26.860
Okay?

21:42.850 --> 21:47.850
Dude. Me and Steve found a way into that
old car dealership on East Avenue.

22:07.850 --> 22:08.990
Hey!

22:09.090 --> 22:10.910
What?

22:11.010 --> 22:12.670
Don't throw things at my sister.

22:12.770 --> 22:15.630
Yeah? Why not? It's funny.

22:15.730 --> 22:18.010
Don't throw things at my sister!

22:18.536 --> 22:20.632
Those the only words you know?

22:22.530 --> 22:24.350
I fingered your mom with that.

22:24.450 --> 22:27.870
I heard you're a fucking psycho.

22:27.970 --> 22:30.510
But you look more like a pussy to me.

22:30.610 --> 22:34.870
I thought you'd be wearing that princess
costume since you're such a f...

22:34.970 --> 22:36.710
I don't care what he called you, Jacob.

22:36.810 --> 22:38.630
- Can I talk?
- Go up to your room, baby.

22:38.730 --> 22:40.190
- I said, can I talk?
- Fine. Talk.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.870
- He was hurting Haley!
- You broke his nose.

22:42.970 --> 22:46.470
We were almost done with
Mrs. Wallace, and then you do this?

22:46.570 --> 22:49.710
You cannot get into fights.
You have to go get a counselor.

22:49.810 --> 22:51.710
You can't keep
sabotaging yourself like this.

22:51.810 --> 22:55.292
Do not walk away from me when I am
talking to you! Your father used to...

22:58.290 --> 23:01.390
Please. Jacob,
we need to talk through this.

23:01.490 --> 23:04.430
- Maybe Dad had the right idea!
- What do you want me to say?

23:04.530 --> 23:06.510
That it's fine that you got
into another fight?

23:06.610 --> 23:08.658
I'm sorry, okay?

23:13.850 --> 23:16.350
Jake, you have got to
get control of your anger.

23:16.450 --> 23:18.390
I'm sick of talking about this!

23:18.490 --> 23:21.110
That kid was bothering Haley!

23:21.210 --> 23:24.578
Mom and Jake are fighting again,
like you and Mom did.

23:26.090 --> 23:28.310
I wish they'd stop.

23:28.410 --> 23:30.510
Mom doesn't want to scare me,

23:30.610 --> 23:33.011
but she doesn't think you're you.

23:34.610 --> 23:37.270
Why aren't you saying anything?

23:39.050 --> 23:40.779
You can't get this mad all the time.

23:41.850 --> 23:44.110
I love you.

23:44.210 --> 23:45.700
I want you to be okay.

23:46.610 --> 23:48.851
Jake. Jake. Jacob!

24:03.690 --> 24:05.950
You don't understand me!

24:08.450 --> 24:09.975
Here. You okay?

24:10.090 --> 24:11.979
Haley, I'm...

24:22.877 --> 24:25.150
He just snapped and ran out.

24:25.250 --> 24:28.070
Well, he lucked out.
If it had been during the school year,

24:28.170 --> 24:31.870
he might have been expelled rather than
just getting kicked out of the program.

24:31.970 --> 24:36.030
But hey. Hey. I can... I can teach him
someplace else. Maybe even here.

24:36.130 --> 24:38.576
That way I could see you also.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.230
Where is he right now?

24:41.330 --> 24:42.990
They're both asleep. I mean, he...

24:43.090 --> 24:46.270
He calmed down eventually. It's just...

24:46.370 --> 24:48.030
I hate seeing him like this, you know.

24:48.130 --> 24:50.417
He reminds me...

24:54.930 --> 24:56.470
- I'm sorry. I don't want to...
- No.

24:56.570 --> 24:57.935
No. Hey.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.333
It's okay. You really can
talk about him, you know.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.211
You know, when Mark and I
first got married...

25:11.050 --> 25:14.230
we would come out here and make plans.

25:14.330 --> 25:16.870
- About what?
- Future.

25:16.970 --> 25:19.110
I used to do that.

25:19.210 --> 25:20.350
Not anymore?

25:20.450 --> 25:21.910
No.

25:22.010 --> 25:25.070
After I was fired from my last job,
I just kind of...

25:25.170 --> 25:27.790
learned to keep an eye on the present.

25:27.890 --> 25:29.415
Made things simpler.

25:42.810 --> 25:44.510
When Mark got worse,

25:44.610 --> 25:47.181
it was like mood swings
and depression and...

25:48.410 --> 25:50.299
I know this sounds awful, but...

25:51.650 --> 25:54.301
after he was buried,
I felt a sense of relief.

25:57.370 --> 25:58.895
Like I was...

26:00.690 --> 26:02.990
ready to be on my own.

26:03.090 --> 26:08.256
God, that doesn't sound awful.
That sounds totally natural.

26:12.970 --> 26:14.574
I thought you said you quit.

26:16.770 --> 26:18.181
Yeah. Um...

26:18.290 --> 26:19.910
Actually, I was forced to quit.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.350
Hmm.

26:21.450 --> 26:26.870
Uh, I was doing work I was
really uncomfortable with, and...

26:26.970 --> 26:28.950
Well, my boss and I,
we had just a really...

26:29.050 --> 26:31.052
a difference of opinion.

26:31.810 --> 26:33.590
And so I left...

26:33.690 --> 26:35.294
and followed a new dream.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.300
And here we are.

27:04.810 --> 27:06.335
Give me one.

27:10.090 --> 27:12.570
- Sick.
- Give me another one.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.939
We shouldn't.

27:19.050 --> 27:20.939
- Shouldn't?
- Yeah.

27:53.010 --> 27:54.510
There's somebody there.

27:54.610 --> 27:57.181
Shut up! They're asleep.

28:29.290 --> 28:32.134
Either do it or fucking don't,
but we can't just stand here.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.211
Watch thi...

28:44.770 --> 28:46.646
You hear that?

28:47.490 --> 28:49.150
What?

28:49.250 --> 28:51.981
No, I just... thought I heard
someone scream outside.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.150
Are you sure it was from outside?

28:55.250 --> 28:56.670
Yeah. Why?

28:56.770 --> 28:58.818
Recently we, uh...

29:03.850 --> 29:05.011
It's nothing.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.270
Are you sure?

29:08.370 --> 29:10.054
You're very sweet.

29:10.170 --> 29:15.973
Oh. I think by "sweet," you mean "ruggedly
handsome and a little bit dangerous."

29:16.090 --> 29:18.252
I definitely mean "sweet."

29:20.690 --> 29:22.021
Hmm.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.618
- I hate to ask...
- Hmm. I know.

29:28.810 --> 29:32.190
- The kids are...
- No. Hey. Hey. It's...

29:32.917 --> 29:34.372
It's okay.

29:35.890 --> 29:37.301
I totally understand.

29:37.450 --> 29:40.215
- It's been a tough week for us.
- Seriously. It's okay.

29:41.130 --> 29:42.950
I'll, uh...

29:43.050 --> 29:44.779
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.261
Hello?

32:14.450 --> 32:15.736
Mom!

32:16.770 --> 32:18.135
Mom!

32:21.210 --> 32:23.053
What? You okay?

32:28.093 --> 32:30.357
It must have gone away.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.057
Haley. Let's go.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.150
Hey. Calm down.

32:55.650 --> 32:57.990
Be right back.

32:58.090 --> 32:59.615
Did it hurt you?

33:01.290 --> 33:02.337
Mom.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.738
We're leaving.

33:08.610 --> 33:10.612
Is everything going to be okay?

33:12.810 --> 33:14.550
It's okay, baby.

33:14.650 --> 33:16.220
It's okay.

33:50.330 --> 33:52.550
Come here. Your arms.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.140
Oh, my God.

34:03.336 --> 34:05.780
- Mom, that hurts.
- Just a little bit more, okay?

34:07.850 --> 34:10.091
Don't look at it, baby.
Don't look at it.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.870
Come on. Jacob.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.949
Let's go.

34:15.050 --> 34:19.422
Jacob. Come on. Hey, honey. I want you
to take your sister and wait right outside.

34:19.522 --> 34:22.389
- Okay. Come on.
- Right outside.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.630
Hey. Hey. Hi. Sorry.

34:29.730 --> 34:32.750
No. Can we just come
stay with you for a little bit?

34:32.850 --> 34:34.818
No, I can't explain right now.

34:36.010 --> 34:37.614
No, I just...

34:38.690 --> 34:41.496
Okay. We'll be there in 20.

34:42.530 --> 34:44.909
Mom! Mom!

34:45.010 --> 34:46.056
Mom!

34:48.010 --> 34:49.216
Jake!

34:51.010 --> 34:53.775
Jake, what happened?
Talk to me. Haley, bring me the phone.

34:57.210 --> 34:59.895
Baby, please. Mommy needs you.
Go grab the phone.

35:00.970 --> 35:03.190
You'll be okay, honey. Okay.

35:03.290 --> 35:04.621
Help!

35:07.050 --> 35:09.590
Is Jacob going to be okay?

35:09.690 --> 35:11.897
He's gonna be fine, sweetie.

35:12.570 --> 35:13.571
Haley!

35:14.570 --> 35:17.495
Haley. Come here, baby girl.

35:17.595 --> 35:19.218
I'm here.

35:19.330 --> 35:20.570
Help!

35:24.050 --> 35:25.893
It's okay, baby.

35:35.490 --> 35:37.190
911. What's your emergency?

35:37.290 --> 35:38.990
My children. Something's wrong!

35:39.090 --> 35:40.550
Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.

35:40.650 --> 35:43.150
- Mom.
- What happened to your children?

35:43.250 --> 35:44.934
I'm okay.

35:45.050 --> 35:47.310
- Mom!
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

35:47.410 --> 35:49.350
- Do you need assistance?
- No.

35:49.450 --> 35:52.521
- Are you sure, ma'am?
- No, they're fine.

36:08.530 --> 36:10.590
He looked like he was going to die.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.500
I mean, they're fine now, like you saw.

36:14.450 --> 36:15.975
But out here...

36:17.170 --> 36:19.110
I'll need to do some tests
on the children as well.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.790
If you don't mind.

36:20.890 --> 36:22.813
Yes. Thank you.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.931
Okay. Last one.

36:36.530 --> 36:38.294
You did an excellent job.

36:38.970 --> 36:40.470
Let's see how it goes.

36:47.990 --> 36:50.590
- Hello?
- Hello, Ms. Heller. This is Austin Hamilton.

36:50.690 --> 36:52.110
Yes. Um...

36:52.210 --> 36:54.372
I wanted to follow up
on our conversation yesterday.

36:54.490 --> 36:57.812
- Like I said, we'd like to move quickly on this.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

36:57.930 --> 37:00.470
Sounds good. Okay. I just wanted to
mention that we've gotten...

37:00.570 --> 37:02.630
I will call you back.

37:02.730 --> 37:04.670
Geez.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.110
What does it mean?

37:11.210 --> 37:13.590
Well, it means that the two of you
are in very good health...

37:13.690 --> 37:15.830
and you have no visible reactions
to common allergens.

37:15.930 --> 37:18.661
Well, then you're testing them
for the wrong things.

37:20.810 --> 37:22.335
May I speak to you alone?

37:25.690 --> 37:29.058
Ms. Heller, I've done every test
I can on your children.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.980
Right now,
I can't find anything obvious.

37:32.090 --> 37:33.590
Maybe when I get back to the lab.

37:33.690 --> 37:37.820
So what are you saying?
That we just stay in the house?

37:37.930 --> 37:40.590
Until I finish processing
the blood work, yeah.

37:40.690 --> 37:42.910
They seem fine while they're inside.

37:43.010 --> 37:45.230
I've seen cases like this before,

37:45.330 --> 37:50.350
where maybe they're experiencing
symptoms brought on by stress.

37:50.450 --> 37:52.910
Perhaps you are too.

37:53.010 --> 37:55.150
This isn't stress.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.830
This isn't psychosomatic.

37:56.930 --> 37:59.750
This is very, very real.
They almost died.

37:59.850 --> 38:03.950
You've told me that. Right now,
I can't find anything wrong with them.

38:04.050 --> 38:05.590
Do you think I'm lying?

38:05.690 --> 38:07.790
I could also observe their symptoms
while they're outside.

38:07.890 --> 38:09.574
I'm not doing that to my children.

38:11.090 --> 38:12.615
Thank you for your time.

38:14.210 --> 38:17.293
I'll run the samples at the lab
and notify you if I turn up anything.

38:49.090 --> 38:50.774
Haley?

38:53.330 --> 38:54.616
Hales.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.974
Haley.

39:04.850 --> 39:06.340
Haley.

39:09.850 --> 39:11.454
What are you drawing?

39:13.130 --> 39:15.190
Um... Dinosaurs.

39:15.290 --> 39:19.870
I think the horses are queens
and the dinosaurs are soldiers.

39:19.970 --> 39:21.470
Are they friends?

39:21.570 --> 39:23.390
Um, sort of.

39:23.490 --> 39:27.550
Did you know that horses and dinosaurs
lived millions and millions of years apart?

39:27.650 --> 39:30.176
Yep. But I got bored of drawing horses.

40:42.930 --> 40:44.377
It's okay.

40:45.370 --> 40:47.611
It's okay. Just stay here.

40:50.410 --> 40:51.571
Jacob?

40:59.810 --> 41:01.335
Jesus. Jacob!

41:02.330 --> 41:03.510
What?

41:03.610 --> 41:05.339
Don't scare us like that.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.252
Haley, it's okay.
It's just your brother.

41:12.250 --> 41:15.379
Oh. God. What are you doing down here?

41:17.010 --> 41:19.012
I thought I can try and fix this.

41:25.090 --> 41:26.740
Oh, my gosh.

41:30.450 --> 41:32.214
Wow. You remember this?

41:34.930 --> 41:36.341
No.

41:38.570 --> 41:40.732
You used to love Halloween so much.

41:42.690 --> 41:44.340
I don't remember it.

41:46.970 --> 41:49.416
He told me not to make the volcano.

41:51.130 --> 41:53.576
I only did it because he thought
I should do something different.

41:56.530 --> 42:00.110
I couldn't stop yelling at him, and then
he left, and... It's all my fault, Mommy.

42:00.210 --> 42:01.990
Jake, stop.

42:02.090 --> 42:04.331
He didn't leave
because of your argument.

42:08.290 --> 42:10.691
He left because I told him to.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.176
Hey.

42:17.130 --> 42:19.337
Your dad had become a really...

42:21.490 --> 42:24.190
angry man.

42:24.290 --> 42:25.780
And I couldn't take it anymore.

42:27.130 --> 42:30.020
Okay? It was nothing that you did.

42:32.690 --> 42:34.190
Jake!

43:04.370 --> 43:07.214
Haley? Jacob?

43:11.210 --> 43:12.950
Hey, guys.

43:13.050 --> 43:14.540
Yeah?

43:15.370 --> 43:18.055
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

43:39.090 --> 43:41.092
I tried the front but nobody answered.

43:41.250 --> 43:42.710
- Mr. Hamilton...
- Austin, please.

43:42.810 --> 43:44.870
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by. Now listen.

43:44.970 --> 43:47.710
It will only take a day or two to get that
paperwork going, and then...

43:47.810 --> 43:51.470
I'm sorry. Look, I'm not gonna
be able to, at least not right now.

43:51.570 --> 43:53.430
There's been some complications,
and I can't...

43:53.530 --> 43:56.773
Look, I'm trying to help you here. Okay?

43:56.890 --> 43:59.590
Because we could begin
foreclosure proceedings at any time.

43:59.690 --> 44:02.270
This is harassment.
I'm only a month behind.

44:02.370 --> 44:04.430
You're as behind as we say you are.

44:04.530 --> 44:06.910
Now I don't know if somebody
is giving you bad advice here,

44:07.010 --> 44:08.590
but this offer is real.

44:08.690 --> 44:12.070
The offer doesn't make a difference.

44:12.170 --> 44:14.470
My children are sick.

44:14.570 --> 44:16.334
Okay? We can't leave this house.

44:16.450 --> 44:19.215
I'm sure they'd be just as comfortable
someplace else. Maybe even more so.

44:19.330 --> 44:21.350
- You don't understand.
- Okay.

44:21.450 --> 44:25.091
Why don't you think about it then,
and I'll come back.

44:57.770 --> 44:59.390
What?

44:59.490 --> 45:00.950
Hey.

45:01.050 --> 45:03.430
Sorry. I, um...

45:03.530 --> 45:05.510
I thought that you were someone else.

45:05.610 --> 45:08.590
Um, you mean the guy that
was walking down the driveway?

45:08.690 --> 45:10.215
He's, um...

45:13.690 --> 45:15.550
Forget it.

45:15.650 --> 45:20.030
Um, I just wanted to check on you guys
and see if you were okay.

45:20.130 --> 45:22.310
You guys didn't come over
the other night.

45:22.410 --> 45:25.310
I just... I didn't really know
what to think.

45:25.410 --> 45:27.538
So are you guys okay?

45:28.890 --> 45:31.416
I don't know.

45:32.770 --> 45:35.250
What's... What's going on?

45:36.410 --> 45:39.590
You know, I haven't been as...

45:39.690 --> 45:41.110
open with you...

45:41.210 --> 45:43.110
as I should be.

45:43.210 --> 45:45.390
You deserve that.

45:45.490 --> 45:48.858
You deserve to be with someone
that can offer that to you.

45:51.130 --> 45:53.550
Wow. Um...

45:53.650 --> 45:55.937
Where's this all coming from?

45:56.050 --> 46:00.055
There's a situation in my life
that I can't talk to you about.

46:00.170 --> 46:02.776
- Okay.
- Look, I don't want you to get hurt.

46:02.890 --> 46:04.335
Okay, I understand.

46:04.450 --> 46:06.430
- I'm sorry. I...
- Hey. You know what? It's okay.

46:06.530 --> 46:10.296
Mom! I can't find my dragon tail!

46:13.770 --> 46:16.011
It's in the laundry room. One sec.

46:18.330 --> 46:19.570
No.

46:44.250 --> 46:47.971
- Can we try again?
- Hey! No!

46:49.507 --> 46:51.038
Madison!

47:02.330 --> 47:03.510
No!

47:07.690 --> 47:09.792
Step away from the door!

47:13.050 --> 47:14.852
No!

47:17.906 --> 47:19.137
Get up! Go!

47:22.090 --> 47:23.091
No!

47:25.970 --> 47:27.460
Madison!

47:59.650 --> 48:02.390
But we have to call people.
This is enormous.

48:02.490 --> 48:04.390
This changes almost everything
that we know of...

48:04.490 --> 48:07.950
I've called the police so many times,
thinking that someone has broken in.

48:08.050 --> 48:10.470
I've had paranormal psychologists here.

48:10.570 --> 48:14.070
Mediums, clairvoyants, priests.

48:14.170 --> 48:16.270
No one believes me.

48:16.370 --> 48:18.350
Let me help you.

48:18.450 --> 48:20.990
The burns. Who did you speak to
about them? They can be analyzed.

48:21.090 --> 48:22.910
I had an immunologist come to the house.

48:23.010 --> 48:25.750
He... He thinks that it's psychosomatic.

48:25.850 --> 48:28.910
And the kids. They can't be more
than a few feet away?

48:29.610 --> 48:33.427
I mean, I've tried
to find similar cases...

48:34.850 --> 48:38.390
Something to try
to make this make sense.

48:38.490 --> 48:40.110
There was a...

48:40.210 --> 48:43.150
There was a scientist at CamSET.

48:43.250 --> 48:44.710
He couldn't leave his office,

48:44.810 --> 48:47.870
and the doctors couldn't figure out why.

48:47.970 --> 48:49.950
How often does it appear?

48:50.050 --> 48:53.750
Sometimes never. Sometimes twice a day.

48:53.850 --> 48:55.950
Some are more grotesque than others.

48:56.050 --> 48:57.540
There are others?

48:57.650 --> 48:59.750
There are three different things.

48:59.850 --> 49:02.630
And it always manifests like that?
The same way every time?

49:02.730 --> 49:04.790
Mm-hmm. There's a flash of light,

49:04.890 --> 49:06.380
and then something appears.

49:06.490 --> 49:08.830
And then another flash of light,
and then it's gone.

49:08.930 --> 49:10.790
Okay. What else?

49:10.890 --> 49:12.350
Uh, sometimes the rooms get colder.

49:12.450 --> 49:15.830
A strange hum. Doors open and shut.

49:15.930 --> 49:18.150
I've heard Haley talking to them.

49:18.250 --> 49:20.310
And the electronics...
Does anything happen to the electronics?

49:20.410 --> 49:23.270
The electronics go crazy.
It's never the same.

49:23.370 --> 49:26.658
I've seen one of them
walk through walls.

49:27.770 --> 49:29.772
This is incredible.

49:29.890 --> 49:32.590
You're experiencing a phenomenon that has
never been fully documented. This is...

49:32.690 --> 49:34.990
Nick, this is my family.

49:35.090 --> 49:36.870
We'll figure this out.

49:36.970 --> 49:38.699
I promise.

50:01.770 --> 50:03.430
Hey, Carl.

50:04.030 --> 50:06.295
It's the last time I can do this.

50:06.410 --> 50:08.412
- No kidding, Nick. It's the last time.
- I know. I know.

50:08.530 --> 50:10.150
- It's all in here.
- Cameras?

50:10.250 --> 50:11.979
Two of them.

50:14.330 --> 50:16.750
How's the shop?

50:16.850 --> 50:19.330
It's good.
The guys are asking about you.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.498
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:21.650 --> 50:23.670
- Are they still, uh...
- Yeah.

50:23.770 --> 50:25.870
I'm not as high up the ladder
as you were, Nick.

50:25.970 --> 50:28.470
I don't know if they're...
they're still doing that.

50:28.570 --> 50:30.710
But they are still using your work.

50:30.810 --> 50:33.190
ECHO is really gaining steam.

50:33.290 --> 50:37.181
- Wow.
- What are you working on?

50:37.330 --> 50:39.458
- Uh, just some experiments, you know.
- Uh-huh.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.603
I'll get these back to you
as soon as I can, Carl.

50:41.703 --> 50:43.216
Yep.

50:43.650 --> 50:45.334
Be smart.

50:53.250 --> 50:58.190
Ms. Heller, I want you to understand that
I only have Jacob's best interests in mind.

50:58.290 --> 51:01.350
You know, about the fight...
He was protecting Haley.

51:01.450 --> 51:03.830
He knows what he did was wrong.

51:03.930 --> 51:05.590
May I speak with him?

51:05.690 --> 51:09.070
Jacob, do you know how serious this is?

51:09.170 --> 51:11.855
Can you tell me why you hurt Danny?

51:13.330 --> 51:15.510
He was...

51:15.610 --> 51:17.990
He was throwing things at Haley.

51:18.090 --> 51:20.910
And when I saw him hurting her, I...

51:21.010 --> 51:23.350
I told him to stop, twice,

51:23.450 --> 51:26.510
and he kept on doing it.

51:26.610 --> 51:29.430
And I'm sorry. I really am.

51:29.530 --> 51:31.030
I just...

51:31.130 --> 51:34.737
I was just scared that
he might've hurt her even more.

51:39.170 --> 51:40.750
So what happens now?

51:40.850 --> 51:43.430
I'm not sure that this is the healthiest
environment for your children.

51:43.530 --> 51:46.390
A bully was hurting
his five-year-old sister.

51:46.490 --> 51:48.110
Come on. What was he supposed to do?

51:48.210 --> 51:50.150
He needs to show some restraints.

51:50.250 --> 51:52.710
Why does that other kid get the benefit
of the doubt and Jacob doesn't?

51:52.810 --> 51:56.510
Because that kid didn't beat another child
unconscious in the last six months.

51:56.610 --> 51:59.790
He's lucky to have escaped
juvenile hall in the first place.

51:59.890 --> 52:01.950
Jacqueline, you know him.

52:02.050 --> 52:04.470
Look, Jacob is a special kid.
I can see that.

52:04.570 --> 52:06.550
But these incidents
can't keep repeating.

52:06.650 --> 52:08.670
Danny's family want
to push for legal action.

52:08.770 --> 52:10.790
And you know what? I agree with them.

52:10.890 --> 52:14.150
Jacob needs to learn that his violent
behavior has consequences.

52:14.250 --> 52:15.910
He's just a kid.

52:16.010 --> 52:17.990
I will give you a copy of my report.

52:18.090 --> 52:21.219
In the meantime, I suggest
you obtain some legal counsel.

52:22.930 --> 52:26.390
No one is taking him out of this house.

52:26.490 --> 52:28.618
Good luck, Ms. Heller.

52:34.090 --> 52:36.430
Don't go past the steps.

52:41.370 --> 52:43.750
Is it bad?

52:45.530 --> 52:47.532
It's not great.

52:48.810 --> 52:49.971
But no.

52:50.090 --> 52:54.110
No, it's something that
we're going to deal with.

52:54.210 --> 52:57.020
And it's... it's going to be okay.

52:58.370 --> 53:00.452
I really tried.

53:02.290 --> 53:04.510
Come here.

53:10.490 --> 53:12.070
Oh. Be careful.

53:12.170 --> 53:14.190
God, where did all this come from?

53:14.290 --> 53:16.550
Uh, a friend of mine owed me a favor.

53:16.650 --> 53:19.750
Uh, you said that the phenomena
always starts and ends with a flash.

53:19.850 --> 53:20.990
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:21.090 --> 53:23.550
Well, a flash denotes
energy output, so...

53:23.650 --> 53:26.630
with this, we'll be able to measure
any sort of strange readings,

53:26.730 --> 53:31.110
any spikes in energy, jumps in
background radiation, stuff like that.

53:31.210 --> 53:33.390
- Careful.
- You know?

53:33.490 --> 53:35.458
Hey. Can you grab me that case?

53:43.010 --> 53:44.694
Thank you.

53:49.330 --> 53:52.190
This sees up to
10,000 frames per second.

53:52.290 --> 53:55.750
Which means that we will see everything.

53:55.850 --> 53:58.230
I will put one upstairs as well.

53:58.330 --> 54:00.470
And...

54:00.570 --> 54:02.430
Hey, hey. Madison.

54:02.530 --> 54:04.453
It's going to be okay.

54:04.570 --> 54:06.630
- I mean, if it tries to hurt my kids again...
- I know.

54:06.730 --> 54:08.430
This is cool.

54:08.530 --> 54:12.230
Uh, I measured the normal
electromagnetic readings of the house,

54:12.330 --> 54:16.430
and we'll find out
if that number changes.

54:16.530 --> 54:17.816
So...

54:19.130 --> 54:20.620
We just wait.

54:26.530 --> 54:28.470
- I learned it from him!
- No, you did not.

54:28.570 --> 54:30.670
I'll take ownership of that.
I'll take blame for that one.

54:30.770 --> 54:32.430
Ready? Let's do this.

54:32.530 --> 54:34.612
It's my turn. Where's my ship?

54:34.730 --> 54:36.459
- Where's my ship? Oh, here it is.
- Found it!

54:36.570 --> 54:39.790
This is an important roll, guys.
I'm nervous.

54:39.890 --> 54:41.892
You guys ready for this?
Haley, are you stealing...

54:42.010 --> 54:44.456
- Really?
- I'm not doing this.

54:44.570 --> 54:46.174
My goodness.

54:46.290 --> 54:47.750
Okay. All right.

54:47.850 --> 54:50.615
- One, two, three...
- Yeah, you lost. I know it for sure.

54:50.730 --> 54:52.550
- You're going to go to jail.
- Aw.

54:52.650 --> 54:54.310
All I do is go to jail in this game.

54:54.410 --> 54:56.310
- You should practice more.
- Oh, I should practice more?

54:56.410 --> 54:58.270
- Haley, do I need to practice more?
- Maybe.

54:58.370 --> 55:00.710
Maybe? That's so sweet.

55:00.810 --> 55:02.910
- Can I put them anywhere now?
- Uh-uh.

55:03.010 --> 55:05.150
Just a little more?

55:05.250 --> 55:06.740
Fill it up.

55:06.850 --> 55:08.420
Yeah!

55:08.530 --> 55:10.214
- Train station!
- To the train station?

55:10.330 --> 55:12.830
- All right. It's my turn, so watch out.
- All right, let's go.

55:12.930 --> 55:15.410
- What do you got?
- Ready?

55:27.770 --> 55:29.350
It's happening.

55:48.890 --> 55:50.733
- Jacob!
- Jacob, come back!

56:11.450 --> 56:13.390
- What's that sound?
- Mom!

56:13.490 --> 56:15.094
- Go.
- It's okay.

56:25.530 --> 56:27.458
Go!

56:45.650 --> 56:47.573
Upstairs! Go.

57:05.130 --> 57:06.939
No! In here!

57:08.650 --> 57:10.220
Stay back!

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:58.430
We hurt it.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.990
How's that possible?

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.172
I don't know, buddy.

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:04.670
We have data now. Lots of it, so...

01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:06.420
Can I help?

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.458
Yeah. Bring me that notebook.

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:24.310
Well, you do know that CamSET
Holdings owns the mortgage on your home.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:28.096
We'll get the ball rolling and have you
and your family out of here in no time.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.300
That doesn't make sense.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.670
Okay, play it again.

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.451
There, there. Do you hear it?

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.097
- It's a pattern.
- We need to isolate it.

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.370
Okay, play it one more time.

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:54.092
What is that?

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:15.014
- What are those?
- Sequenced intervals.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.230
- Is it energy output?
- No. No, not this.

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:22.150
This is too... No, it's too regular.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.390
It's repeating,
like it's on a constant loop.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.572
Jacob, go downstairs.

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:33.212
What is Project ECHO?

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.350
- What?
- What is it?

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:37.950
How did you hear about ECHO?

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:40.291
Why didn't you tell me
that you worked at CamSET?

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.110
Madison, the work
that I was doing there was horrible.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:46.750
I was afraid that if you found out
about the things that I'd done,

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:48.830
you would hate me or I would lose you.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:50.390
I didn't want that, Madison. I'm sorry.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.061
What exactly were you working on?

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:56.014
- Are you part of this?
- Part of what?

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:57.670
They're doing this!

01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.295
Doing what? What do you mean?

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:03.350
You were experimenting on people.

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:06.870
No. No. ECHO wouldn't be
possible for another 40 years.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.110
- This teleportation is impossible.
- Then explain this.

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:12.270
Madison, look. This isn't me.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:13.870
Okay? The state...
They offered us volunteers...

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:16.350
that were prisoners,
were injured or worse.

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:19.550
No one at CamSET cared.
I tried to stop them, I swear.

01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:23.030
I just found out too late, Madison.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.950
Let me help you.

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:27.990
Okay? I know what's going on.
I can show you what's happening.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.990
The patterns... The patterns that
I've been measuring from your house...

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:31.550
They've been coming up
regular intervals,

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.220
constantly looping over and over again.

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.270
- What do these numbers look like?
- Coordinates.

01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.656
Right.

01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:41.300
Look at this first one.

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.938
Okay?

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.501
Now, look at the second.

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:57.230
- The signal is coming from CamSET.
- Exactly!

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.390
CamSET is trying to force us
out of this house.

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:03.070
They're expanding here.
We need to shut them down.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:04.660
No. No, you can't.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.430
- Watch me.
- No, no. Madison, you don't understand.

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:07.750
You can't.

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:10.251
What's happening
isn't happening right now.

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:12.179
Like I said, it was 40 years out,

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.270
even in our most optimistic projections.

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.830
The prisoner that's coming here?
He's coming from the future.

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.217
And I don't know how to stop that.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.732
Then we'll kill them.

01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:28.270
Don't touch any of these.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.054
Hey. I mean it.

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:34.218
Jacob, if you need to.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.900
Come on.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.252
- Jacob...
- I know, Mom.

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:16.350
Haley. Hey.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:19.710
I need you to be brave. Okay?
I need you to listen to your brother.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.550
And no matter what,

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.230
do not come out of that basement
until I come for you, okay?

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:26.110
Mama, come with us.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.790
I can't. I will be back so soon.
Okay? I love you.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.865
Go! Go.

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:00.180
Ms. Heller.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.410
Ms. Heller, I brought
the contract with me.

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:21.859
Goddamn it. Ms. Heller...

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:48.470
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Help me.

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:52.270
Help me!

01:09:09.689 --> 01:09:10.750
Hey!

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:14.491
Hey, over here! Come on!

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:02.430
What's happening?

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:04.578
It'll be okay.

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.015
Madison, you have to kill it.

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.390
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.750
Ma'am, step away from him.

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:04.190
Sebastian to backup, 1214 Woodbine.

01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:06.110
Officers, there's a man
outside trying to kill us.

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:08.430
Ma'am, what's the situation here?

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.215
Officer, my kids are in the basement.
Please.

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:16.897
Haley! Jacob! Come here, baby.

01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:32.630
Ma'am?

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:35.674
Are you okay?

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:42.310
What's going on in there?

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:43.900
No!

01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:12.259
Stay away!

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:45.893
Go away!

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.252
Mom!

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:47.390
Hey.

01:13:54.521 --> 01:13:56.036
No.

01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:57.531
Why?

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:00.540
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

01:14:01.244 --> 01:14:03.051
No. No.

01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:06.299
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Mom?

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:53.710
Madison. Hey. Hey. Hey.
Hang on. Hang on.

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:55.430
Okay? It's going to be okay.

01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:57.630
You stay with us.

01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:59.230
Hang on.

01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:01.100
Hang on.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.110
Haley. Haley, get over here.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.470
Press down right here.
Okay? Not too hard.

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:16.030
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:17.700
Jacob, you watch him.

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:27.100
(SOFTLY) Hi.

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.230
Come on, Mom.

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:48.456
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Mama.

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:54.470
It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:56.857
Hey, hey, hey. You stay with me.

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:59.150
- Mama, stay with us.
- You stay with us, please.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:00.750
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:05.777
- Yes, you can.
- Someone needs to stop this.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:10.260
Hey.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.819
Don't.

01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:18.899
We need you.

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:22.830
Jacob, you won't understand right now.

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.976
Please stay.

01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:34.852
Mama, stay.

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:37.510
Come here. Come here.

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:39.294
Mom's gotta do something.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.532
Come here.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:03.375
Yeah, that's it.

01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.710
Nice and easy now, Jacob.

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:11.670
Man, they said not to call these guys
by name 'cause their brains are scrambled.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.310
Don't let the file fool ya.

01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:16.412
He's got something going on up there.

01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:20.470
It ain't much, but...

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.060
it's something.

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:33.150
Hey. So you think
he knows what's going on?

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:37.790
Maybe. They've had him
here for the past 40-some odd years.

01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:39.858
They caught him trying
to blow the place up.

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:42.150
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:45.230
Something about revenge for his mother.

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:48.310
I mean, the things they
put this guy through, man.

01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:51.250
- Turn your blood cold.
- What are they doing today?

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:54.110
They're going to teleport my man
about 10 miles away from here.

01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:55.735
Should be quite a sight.

01:18:56.770 --> 01:19:01.300
Yeah, they tried this with some others,
but it wasn't quite so pretty.

01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:06.270
This man can usually take
whatever it is they dish out to him.

01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:09.533
This little ride would be
a piece of cake for him.

01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:23.910
Stop!

01:20:22.210 --> 01:20:25.214
Nothing to see here.
Please get back in your homes.

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.190
Jacob, come on.

01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:54.452
Let's go upstairs.
