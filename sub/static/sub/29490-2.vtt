WEBVTT

00:37.907 --> 00:39.256
Open.

00:51.442 --> 00:54.271
No!

00:54.315 --> 00:56.404
Aah!

01:17.120 --> 01:19.253
Aah!

01:44.365 --> 01:45.322
Mama!

01:52.982 --> 01:54.984
Hurry, Mama!

01:57.813 --> 01:59.293
Mama!

01:59.336 --> 02:01.991
Mama, hurry!

02:03.427 --> 02:05.168
Mama!

02:18.312 --> 02:21.228
I'm so sorry, Mama.

02:21.271 --> 02:24.970
You almost got us killed
again.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.019
Mama, there's a man.

03:35.302 --> 03:39.219
It is time that
the pack returns.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.874
There is more gathering to be done,

03:42.918 --> 03:45.268
Guardians to be found.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.924
We are far from the enemy.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.274
Their fear will subside.

03:51.318 --> 03:55.452
They will fear us no matter where we are.

03:55.496 --> 03:59.369
They fill fear us because of what we did.

03:59.413 --> 04:03.504
Do you doubt me?
Our mission?

04:03.547 --> 04:05.288
Never.

04:08.422 --> 04:11.207
Take the sisters
when you depart.

04:11.251 --> 04:17.213
They have a real gift, a scent for the dead.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.312
We don't mean harm.

04:34.535 --> 04:37.451
Can you talk?

04:49.376 --> 04:52.379
Mama, I don't like this.
Please...

04:52.422 --> 04:55.730
Go on and try to kill us.

04:55.773 --> 05:01.431
But know two things -- One, I do not die easily,

05:01.475 --> 05:04.521
and, two, you must also kill my daughter

05:04.565 --> 05:07.916
because I will not leave this Earth without her.

05:14.139 --> 05:17.404
One night.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.538
Thank you.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.411
Do not leave this hallway.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.460
Do you think
I could wash up?

05:30.504 --> 05:33.855
Sorry, Mama,
but the smell... Is there water?

05:43.386 --> 05:45.649
Is he a monster?

05:48.260 --> 05:51.046
We're all monsters now.

05:54.658 --> 05:57.922
Beta: Be on alert.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.795
Buildings could be full.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.275
Male Whisperer #1:
Gather all of them?

06:03.319 --> 06:05.669
Every last one
we can find.

06:17.464 --> 06:21.424
Split up. We track better apart.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.341
Did you hear me?

07:07.252 --> 07:09.690
He's watching you.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.997
Frances: The sun feels...
different today.

07:14.564 --> 07:17.437
Can you feel that,
sister?

07:17.480 --> 07:20.483
Like it's burning
right into our skin.

07:20.527 --> 07:24.574
Stop it. Your head's in the clouds again.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.795
He'll see that you're not committed to the cause...

07:27.838 --> 07:29.797
to her.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.020
Don't say that.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.506
I should've left you behind when I had the chance.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.210
I hear them.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.995
Over there.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.591
Shh.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.546
Were you singing?

09:08.722 --> 09:10.375
Wouldn't call it that.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.595
Don't do it again.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.693
You have a name?

09:23.737 --> 09:26.566
The dead
don't have names.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.873
And we shouldn't,
either.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.615
Without names or a past,

09:32.659 --> 09:35.705
those of us strong enough
to still be alive out here

09:35.749 --> 09:38.447
can know each other
on a primal level.

09:45.497 --> 09:48.283
They fear nothing.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.981
They want only to feed.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.724
They are free.

09:59.294 --> 10:02.340
How'd you end up
in here?

10:02.384 --> 10:06.606
Got into a tussle
with the dead,

10:06.649 --> 10:09.696
ran me out of my camp a few months ago.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.046
Is that why
you wear that?

10:15.005 --> 10:17.486
Lydia: Mama, come back!

10:20.097 --> 10:23.579
I like it...

10:24.711 --> 10:27.452
...the sound
of the dead.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.848
It's the only song I never want to end.

11:58.543 --> 12:01.633
Sister, focus.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.972
What is wrong with you?

12:39.584 --> 12:42.762
You will pay.

12:47.984 --> 12:51.031
I'm sorry.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.034
I'm sorry.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.645
I'm sorry.

12:56.688 --> 12:59.474
I don't feel...

12:59.517 --> 13:01.781
he's better there.

13:01.824 --> 13:05.219
I love him, and he's gone.

13:11.616 --> 13:15.316
He's with them
in a better place!

13:15.359 --> 13:16.621
Alpha: Stop!

13:46.913 --> 13:51.569
Beta: She is an uncommitted now.

13:51.613 --> 13:55.922
Her actions threatened
the entire pack.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.796
Leaving her child
broke her.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.627
You will never understand how it feels to abandon your child.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.586
You still think
of Lydia.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.851
She was dead to me
long before I ended her.

14:19.684 --> 14:23.471
Bring her to me
in the deeper place.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.125
I'll be waiting.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.743
You're gonna sleep
in here.

14:34.786 --> 14:37.354
I'll be right outside.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.966
It'll be quiet.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.882
Why are there big pillows
all over the walls?

14:44.274 --> 14:47.016
So the people put in here wouldn't hurt themselves.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.978
People like that man out there?

14:53.196 --> 14:56.939
These walls could never control someone like that.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.336
You like him?

15:02.379 --> 15:04.642
Uh-huh.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.999
I don't want it.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.393
You've never slept
without her --

15:16.437 --> 15:19.048
I don't want it.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.485
I'm not a baby anymore.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.010
I don't want
that stupid bunny.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.533
I don't want
to be scared.

15:25.576 --> 15:29.189
I want to be more like you,
Mama.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.023
I've waited so long
to hear that.

15:41.027 --> 15:44.769
And I hope
that you will...

15:44.813 --> 15:47.903
because if you can't,

15:47.947 --> 15:51.689
I'll have no choice but to leave you behind.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.343
Please, Mama,
don't ever leave me.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.259
I promise I'll do better
out there. I will.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.392
You'll see.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.179
I love you, Mama.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.617
Stop calling me that.

16:37.822 --> 16:41.130
Alpha, I'm sorry.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.220
Please.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.877
I won't talk about him
again.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.401
Please.

16:51.445 --> 16:54.970
Remove your mask.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.642
Kneel.

18:09.262 --> 18:12.613
Shh.

18:12.656 --> 18:15.224
Shh.

18:15.268 --> 18:18.271
Shh.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.885
Thank you.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.756
Thank you.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.237
Thank you.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.971
Alpha showed you
her grace?

19:07.015 --> 19:10.497
I'll never stray again,
sister.

19:12.412 --> 19:15.284
We keep thinking about
that place, too.

19:15.328 --> 19:18.287
It looked so safe.
There was livestock.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.942
We can all go back.
We can get --

19:36.262 --> 19:37.306
Why?

19:37.350 --> 19:39.917
Do not question me.

19:39.961 --> 19:43.269
But if she strays again, I will skin her alive for all to see.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.967
She unsettles the pack.

19:46.010 --> 19:49.013
Then we keep a close eye, make sure her moment of weakness doesn't infect the others.

19:49.057 --> 19:54.280
The others have already spoken of the enemy, the life they saw.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.152
It is not a life.
It is a fantasy.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.242
And the pack
must learn that again.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.289
They must see it
up close.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.899
They will.
When?

20:04.942 --> 20:06.466
Soon.

20:12.689 --> 20:15.475
Are you content?

20:19.043 --> 20:23.700
I have seen you wander away
from the camp alone at night.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.316
I am right here...

20:30.359 --> 20:33.101
as I've always been.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.970
I like killing
with you.

22:17.031 --> 22:20.469
Oh, you're different.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.211
People who knew me
before all this

22:23.254 --> 22:26.345
would probably say
the same thing.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.175
Never trusted
those people, anyway.

22:31.219 --> 22:34.135
I don't hardly
trust anyone.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.485
Neither do I.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.585
Well done, Big Man.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.547
"Big Man"?
Okay.

22:54.590 --> 22:57.201
"Mr. B."

22:57.245 --> 23:00.117
I thought we didn't have names.

23:00.161 --> 23:03.556
It's not a name.
It's a letter.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.864
So, if I'm "B," what does that make you?

23:07.908 --> 23:10.389
"A."

23:18.832 --> 23:22.618
So, you can move with them when you're covered?

23:22.662 --> 23:26.666
It's not just about
moving with them.

23:26.709 --> 23:31.845
You got to become them,
feel what they feel.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.542
And what do they feel?

23:33.586 --> 23:35.631
Nothing.

23:35.675 --> 23:38.504
There are only two kinds of people left in this world --

23:38.547 --> 23:42.464
the ones brave enough
to walk with the dead

23:42.508 --> 23:45.424
and everybody else.

23:45.467 --> 23:48.514
So, tell me, B,

23:48.557 --> 23:51.212
which one are you?

24:02.005 --> 24:05.008
Leave.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.403
At sunrise.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.884
Don't come back.

24:37.737 --> 24:44.526
What was it like,
To be alone with her?

24:47.137 --> 24:49.662
Just as you'd imagine.

24:52.273 --> 24:57.496
She's powerful,
so calm.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.716
My head finally feels right again.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.982
So, you are no longer
thinking of him?

25:06.026 --> 25:08.463
I'm glad I made that sacrifice.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.598
As Alpha sacrificed
her daughter.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.427
She said when she watched her die,

25:16.471 --> 25:18.952
she didn't shed one tear.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.698
She is Alpha.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.571
She doesn't cry.

25:31.181 --> 25:34.445
I'm so sorry...

25:34.489 --> 25:36.404
for risking
what we have here.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.754
I know.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.718
Don't do it again...

25:45.761 --> 25:47.763
ever.

25:52.638 --> 25:56.380
Did you mean what you said before,

25:56.424 --> 25:58.818
you wish you'd left me behind?

26:07.174 --> 26:09.829
Go to sleep, sis.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.762
Alpha: Pull them back.

27:13.806 --> 27:17.897
Beta: Steady.
Do not break.

27:22.902 --> 27:25.774
There's too many.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.385
Stay the course.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.126
I want them.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.800
Bring him.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.497
You brought a baby
out here?

28:04.770 --> 28:07.424
No!

28:33.320 --> 28:36.540
Aah!

29:20.628 --> 29:23.762
Do you regret
what you did?

29:30.072 --> 29:33.293
She was an uncommitted.

29:33.336 --> 29:36.687
She no longer
belonged with us.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.996
I had to protect
the Alpha.

29:42.476 --> 29:45.218
And you did.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.960
It was your destiny.

29:48.003 --> 29:53.052
As the lion who smothers
her wailing cub,

29:53.095 --> 29:56.838
we're strongest
when we kill our own blood.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.232
It is the purest,
most honest way

29:59.275 --> 30:02.061
to bring order to chaos.

30:02.104 --> 30:05.673
Your purity
will never be forgotten.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.983
Yes, Alpha.

30:15.596 --> 30:18.207
I see greatness in you.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.650
There's a tear.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.478
Should I repair it?

30:31.177 --> 30:33.527
Beta: Leave us.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.894
Are you hurt?

30:54.287 --> 30:57.290
I never felt more calm.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.987
Calm?

31:01.250 --> 31:05.341
We lost three of our own, and many more of the dead,

31:05.385 --> 31:07.866
and you are calm?

31:09.650 --> 31:11.739
It was mayhem.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.703
There is clarity
amid the chaos.

31:23.185 --> 31:26.058
She fears nothing.

31:44.424 --> 31:45.425
Hmm.

32:11.538 --> 32:15.716
Lydia:
We're all monsters now.

32:15.759 --> 32:19.328
We're all monsters now.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.854
We're all monsters now.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.990
We're all...monsters now.

32:29.034 --> 32:32.428
For your bravery
and sacrifice

32:32.472 --> 32:37.956
and for putting the needs
of the pack above your own,

32:37.999 --> 32:39.827
I anoint you Gamma.

32:49.228 --> 32:52.187
To Gamma.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.449
To Gamma.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.973
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.018
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.368
All: To Gamma.
To Gamma.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.588
To Gamma. To Gamma.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.677
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.635
To Gamma. To Gamma.

33:05.679 --> 33:08.160
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

33:08.203 --> 33:11.163
To Gamma. To Gamma.
To Gamma.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.741
You've been gone
for hours.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.049
Are you angry with me?

33:28.093 --> 33:32.401
I feel nothing for you.

33:34.664 --> 33:38.320
I am also empty,
as Alpha wants.

33:38.364 --> 33:41.062
Where is she?

33:41.106 --> 33:44.718
I saw her moving toward the old camp a while ago.

33:57.339 --> 34:01.561
Lydia:
We're all monsters now.

34:01.604 --> 34:05.304
We're all...monsters...now.

34:10.309 --> 34:14.356
We're all monsters now.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.948
Alpha: Lydia?

35:28.343 --> 35:29.649
Lydia?

35:35.698 --> 35:37.004
Lydia?

36:18.872 --> 36:21.266
Have you
lost your way?

36:21.309 --> 36:23.181
Have you?

36:25.226 --> 36:28.925
I told you never to come over here.

36:31.276 --> 36:34.279
I-I need to
find my daughter.

36:34.322 --> 36:37.064
I don't care.

36:37.107 --> 36:41.111
You kept that?

36:42.287 --> 36:44.506
This is for Lydia.

36:47.161 --> 36:52.949
You said she was dead, that you killed her.

36:54.690 --> 36:56.649
You want her back.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.262
You shouldn't have
come here.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.395
Why?

37:03.438 --> 37:06.528
Why did you lie to me?

37:07.921 --> 37:10.489
She is never coming back,

37:10.532 --> 37:13.622
no matter how much
you wish for it

37:13.666 --> 37:18.148
or how hard you try to
replace her with someone else.

37:18.192 --> 37:22.979
She is gone, Alpha!

37:28.507 --> 37:31.292
No!

37:31.336 --> 37:34.774
She's my daughter.
She's my baby.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.692
I could not kill her.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.891
They can't know.

38:04.934 --> 38:09.025
They cannot know
Lydia's alive.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.245
They cannot know.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.509
They won't.

38:14.553 --> 38:17.120
Lydia is dead.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.297
Lydia is dead to me.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.996
She was dead the moment she was born...

38:23.039 --> 38:25.564
'cause she was not
like me.

38:27.609 --> 38:32.571
Because she was not like me. Because she was not like me.

38:34.224 --> 38:36.052
She was not like me.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.793
She was not like me!

38:37.837 --> 38:41.144
She was not...like...me!

38:41.188 --> 38:44.017
She was not like me!

38:44.060 --> 38:46.672
She was not like me!!

38:58.553 --> 39:01.382
I know you better
than you know yourself.

39:01.426 --> 39:04.167
You've got demons,
yeah, just like me.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.517
But you are not broken!

39:05.560 --> 39:08.041
You were made for this.
Aah!

39:08.084 --> 39:12.262
No! Stop! No!
She's trying to save you!

39:21.620 --> 39:23.970
My baby.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.454
Mama, I was strong. You were, baby.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.760
And I'm so proud
of you.

39:31.804 --> 39:35.111
But don't you dare, dare ever leave me again!

39:35.155 --> 39:37.723
You hear me?!

39:50.170 --> 39:54.479
The world, it went dark

39:54.522 --> 39:58.091
so that we could
see a new path.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.963
So come.

40:01.007 --> 40:02.400
Come on.

40:02.443 --> 40:06.142
Walk with me
in the darkness.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.449
Walk with me,

40:08.493 --> 40:11.191
and you will never
be alone again.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.454
My "B."

40:13.498 --> 40:16.631
I am the end
of the world.

40:16.675 --> 40:20.461
I am the end of the world.

40:20.505 --> 40:24.291
I am the end
of the world.

40:25.510 --> 40:29.339
We are the end
of the world.

40:29.383 --> 40:32.908
We are the end
of the world.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.231
Come with us.

40:51.274 --> 40:55.453
I can't leave him.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.154
You won't have to.

41:40.106 --> 41:43.065
I saw smoke
by the border.

41:47.287 --> 41:50.725
The enemy
may have crossed.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.382
We must teach them
a lesson.

41:55.425 --> 41:58.559
And the pack will watch.

41:58.603 --> 42:01.649
We're going back.

42:20.668 --> 42:23.584
Both:
We walk in darkness.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.804
We are free.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.546
We bathe in blood.

42:28.589 --> 42:30.460
We are free.

42:30.504 --> 42:32.985
We love nothing.

42:33.028 --> 42:35.422
We are free.

42:35.465 --> 42:37.598
We fear nothing.

42:37.642 --> 42:40.079
We are free.

42:40.122 --> 42:42.385
We need no words.

42:42.429 --> 42:43.735
We are free.

42:43.778 --> 42:47.129
We embrace all death.

42:47.173 --> 42:48.435
We are free.

42:52.482 --> 42:56.008
This is the end of the world.

43:00.882 --> 43:04.625
Now is the end of the world.

43:07.715 --> 43:11.763
We are the end of the world.
