07:54.891 --> 07:57.310

08:14.660 --> 08:16.787

But 65 years later,she's still living upto her end of the bargain,

08:20.374 --> 08:23.544

08:23.586 --> 08:26.464

And?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.051
That's it.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.969
Well, what elsehas she done?

08:32.010 --> 08:34.764
I mean, has she starteda support group forNavy wives, what?

08:34.804 --> 08:36.724
She goes downto the station.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.725
She waits.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.059
It's a love story.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.519
You know what itreminds me of?

08:40.561 --> 08:41.812

09:16.973 --> 09:18.683
would work for your show,

09:18.724 --> 09:22.103

12:24.076 --> 12:25.453
to see my "friend" here.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.705
You know, I didn't actuallysay that you were my friend.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.331
I just said that I knew you.Hmm.

12:29.373 --> 12:32.960
Wow. This rosebushis beautiful.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.211
Yeah, that bushis dead.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.383
It is not dead.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.428
And it's very special to me.

12:45.306 --> 12:49.143
My husband and I planted ita long time ago.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.228
And when was that?

12:51.270 --> 12:55.274
Uh, Grandma, could you justexcuse us for a moment?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.276
Uh, well, certainly, dear.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.945
Yeah.I'll, uh, I'll get ussome iced tea.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.947
Oh.Sounds great.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.617
There we are.Thank you.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.163
What are youdoing here?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.040
I thought you had no interestin my grandmother.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.459
You know, I think that

13:13.501 --> 13:15.377
I may have given youthe wrong impression.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.505
Really?But...

13:17.505 --> 13:20.382
I'm here now, so...

13:20.424 --> 13:22.843
Five minutes. Please.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.346
(sighs)

13:25.346 --> 13:28.307
We think that it would makethe most beautiful story.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.601
One that would reallyimpact people's lives,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.312
and help themto believe in love.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.148
Kind of like thatJapanese dog story.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.360
Japanese dog story?

13:39.360 --> 13:40.528
Um...

13:40.528 --> 13:43.656
Your story reminds peoplewhat matters most.

13:46.116 --> 13:49.119
What I don't understand is...why me?

13:49.161 --> 13:50.704
There were so many womenwho went through

13:50.746 --> 13:53.165
the same thing I did.My story's no different.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.167
Oh, but it is.

Oh, really?

Lots of womenkept the love alive.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.402

14:21.402 --> 14:23.487
JULIE:That is so sad.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.657
To have your whole life revolvearound going to a train station,

14:26.699 --> 14:28.868
waiting for someonewho's never coming back.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.370
Julie, it's nother whole life.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.497
It is one day a year.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.834
Aw. You spend that much timeevery weekend waiting for me

14:36.875 --> 14:38.961
to come back from golf.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.421
Susan spends that much time

14:40.462 --> 14:42.923
every few weeks going to theairport to wait for Andrew.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.717
The difference being,I get off the plane.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.927
SUSAN:Uh, usually.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.388
One time. One timeI didn't make my flight.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.851
(sighs)Well, um...

14:53.893 --> 14:55.185
I'm here now.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.229
Cooking for you, serving you.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.189
Oh, I knew it.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.774
The candles and the flowers.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.861
You're buttering me up forsomething. Okay, let me guess.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.655
You have accepted an eight-monthassignment in Uzbekistan.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.032
(laughs)

15:08.073 --> 15:12.202
A lifetime assignment.

15:25.966 --> 15:30.137
That's an engagement ring.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.348
That's, uh, what I saidthe minute I saw it.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.851
I said, "Now, that'san engagement ring!"

15:44.026 --> 15:46.320
And your answer is...?

15:46.362 --> 15:48.405
You never asked the question.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.410
I never askedthe question?

15:53.452 --> 15:56.163
What do you think I was sayingwhen I gave you the ring,

15:56.163 --> 15:57.623
uh, "Want to go see a movie?"

15:57.665 --> 16:01.126
The appropriate words wouldhave been, "Will you marry me?"

16:01.168 --> 16:03.879
And maybe you could havedone it in private.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.173
I wanted to share the momentwith our friends, our...

16:06.215 --> 16:08.759
our very good friendswho probably haven'tstopped whispering

16:08.801 --> 16:11.512
"Poor Andrew" out there.Okay, so what didyou want me to do?

16:11.553 --> 16:14.515
Just say "yes" for their benefitand then back out later on?

16:17.017 --> 16:19.853
You're saying no?

16:19.895 --> 16:22.314
(sighs) No, I...

16:22.356 --> 16:24.233
I don't know.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.527
I thought we'd talked aboutgetting married one day.Yeah!

16:26.527 --> 16:28.445
We did, as in"If we ever..."Should we just go?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.030
My car keys and jacketare in there.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.573
We're, we're good together,we get along.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.034
How do you even knowif we get along, Andrew?

16:34.076 --> 16:36.161
You're always in Guatemala,or Rwanda,

16:36.203 --> 16:38.122
or the backside of Egypt.It's what I do!

16:38.163 --> 16:42.334
I go to places,and I take pictures.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.586
You want me tochange what I do?

16:44.628 --> 16:46.338
No.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.804
You want to break up?

16:56.390 --> 16:58.809
Andrew, there isa huge difference

16:58.851 --> 17:02.438
between saying no to amarriage proposal immediately

17:02.479 --> 17:04.272
than breaking up.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.109
(clears throat)

17:08.152 --> 17:11.571
I'll, uh, call you.Or you'll call me.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.615
Whatever, I...

17:18.619 --> 17:21.582
Keep the ring,think about it, and

17:21.623 --> 17:23.040
when I getback from Fiji...

17:23.083 --> 17:26.420
Fiji, right.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.755
What?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.506
Nothing.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.968
By the time you get back,you will have forgiven me

17:33.010 --> 17:34.762
for embarrassing youin front of our friends,

17:34.762 --> 17:36.930
and I will notfeel weird anymore

17:36.972 --> 17:38.891
that you put me on the spot,

17:38.932 --> 17:41.435
and everything will just...

17:41.435 --> 17:43.395
go back to normal.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.987
Promise me you'llthink about it?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.406
About us.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.450
I will, I promise.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.370
(sighs)

18:03.040 --> 18:04.958
Hey, good night,you guys.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.543
Oh, okay.Night, buddy.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.462
Good night,Andrew.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.217
(sighs)

18:13.258 --> 18:15.636
That must've been awfulfor you guys, I'm so sorry.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.096
There's just a lotto think about.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.139
Yeah, what is thereto think about?

18:19.139 --> 18:20.933
You guys have knowneach other for years.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.392
He's a great guy.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.019
He's an incredible guy.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.356
Right. So, what moredo you want?

18:29.733 --> 18:31.276
I don't know.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.073
Okay. Okay.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.034
Um... why don't you tell mewhat's really going on?

18:42.037 --> 18:43.914
If you're going to spendyour life with somebody,

18:43.956 --> 18:45.082
don't you wantto feel excited?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.292
(sighs)Thrilled, even?

18:47.334 --> 18:49.837
I mean, isn't theresupposed to be...

18:49.878 --> 18:51.797
(whispers): magic?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.591
Look, I just...I want you to remember

18:54.633 --> 18:56.885
that good guys arereally hard to come by.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.512
Remember that whenI'm out golfing.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.013
Got it.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.682
I'm crossing my fingersfor you two.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.016
Thank you.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.017
You're welcome.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.603
Good night.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.022
I just... oh.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.649
I don't want you toregret this decision

19:10.691 --> 19:13.360
somewhere down theroad, that's it.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.862
Okay?Okay.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.572
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.035
(door closes)

19:38.051 --> 19:40.053
(knocking on door)

19:41.513 --> 19:43.056
(sighs)

19:43.056 --> 19:44.016
Hello?

19:44.057 --> 19:45.726
(cell phone rings)

19:45.767 --> 19:47.102
Ooh. Hello?

19:47.144 --> 19:49.313
JULIE:Hi. Why aren't youin the editing room?

19:49.354 --> 19:51.690
'Cause I'm meetingCaroline Thomas again.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.526
Until I get that interview,she's my new best friend.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.736
Right.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.779
But, uh, who is goingto edit your segment?

19:57.821 --> 19:59.323
We are, we're already behind.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.616
Um, you are.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.493
Because you're brilliant, okay?So just cover for me?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.245
Craig wants this done,like, now.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.455
Listen, I gotta go.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.126
Hey, there.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.753
You don't believe incalling ahead, do you?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.713
Phones can be hung up.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.924
What happens when someonesays "no" to you?

20:16.965 --> 20:18.759
Uh, never really happens.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.470
Oh, you should get out more.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.472
Where is she?

20:23.513 --> 20:26.266
Oh, she's probably gettingready to go and didn't hear you.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.769
Go?She's got a standingdate on Saturdays.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.605
Maybe she'll take you along.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.398
On a date?

20:35.233 --> 20:38.278
She's got a real soft spotfor military men.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.782
Uh, I'll just...

20:41.823 --> 20:43.951
I'll wait here.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.453
CAROLINE:Here's my fisherman.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.748
Oh and, Dave, I knowyou like sports, I know that.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.209
That's a new one.Okay. Thank you.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.585
Hi.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.962
Hello.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.672
Would you likea magazine?

20:56.713 --> 20:57.881
"Vilify the New York Yankees

20:57.923 --> 21:00.300
"all you want, but quite simply,

21:00.342 --> 21:02.469
the Yankees are greatfor baseball."

21:02.511 --> 21:04.304
Says who?

21:04.346 --> 21:05.514
(laughter)

21:05.555 --> 21:07.474
Oh, come on.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.977
Well, that's whatit says, anyway.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.771
"It is precisely their statusas the most hatedIsn't it painful?

21:12.813 --> 21:15.774
franchise in sports history..."Seeing all thesemen who've returned?

21:15.816 --> 21:18.902
Now we're talking."This year, yet again,She gets indignant when people

21:18.944 --> 21:21.196
get it wrong aboutwho's really in pain here."they lead the league

21:21.238 --> 21:22.447
in both spending and revenue."

21:22.489 --> 21:24.324
I don't hate them.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.827
I just wish they wouldn't beatthe teams I like better.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.663
SUSAN:So, you think she's going to let me do the story?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.915
Don't know.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.709
Well, you do havesome influence on her.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.420
Well, I won't use it.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.381
Not even if I can convinceyou it's a good thing?

21:39.423 --> 21:41.383
It's not my decision to make.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.427
I'll supportwhatever she decides.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.470
Fair enough.

21:45.512 --> 21:49.349
You know, I think it'ssweet that you support her.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.268
We support each other.

21:51.309 --> 21:52.769
After she lost my grandfather,

21:52.811 --> 21:54.855
her whole life wastaking care of others.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.525
My father,her students, me,

21:58.567 --> 22:00.235
these men.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.486
She was 20 years old.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.405
I want to take careof her now.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.702
You're a very unusual guy.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.371
I don't think so.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.873
What, you don't help

22:12.873 --> 22:16.043
and supportyour family?

22:16.043 --> 22:19.796
Um, basically my family'sall in Boston.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.548
We're not close, really.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.968
My... my dad dieda few years ago,

22:25.010 --> 22:28.764
and my mom and I don't really--we don't see each other, so...

22:28.805 --> 22:30.557
I'm rambling.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.601
And I'm sorryabout that.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.603
Is your lowerback bothering you?

22:34.644 --> 22:36.063
No, it's fine.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.440
Maybe you should trystretching out your hips.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.650
You might findyour flexors are tight.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.736
And...

22:42.778 --> 22:44.363
you weren't rambling.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.572
We were talking.

22:47.365 --> 22:51.369
Yeah, I think your grandmother'sprobably done now, so...

22:54.581 --> 22:55.707
(chuckles)

22:55.749 --> 22:57.918
So why do you do this?

22:57.959 --> 22:59.753
Honestly?

22:59.795 --> 23:01.380
(sighs)

23:01.421 --> 23:04.257
At first I--

23:04.299 --> 23:07.594
I was hoping I'd find my Neil.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.264
There were so manywounded men.

23:11.264 --> 23:15.018
And I kept telling myselfanything's possible.

23:15.060 --> 23:19.231
And then, it changed for you?

23:20.899 --> 23:24.319
Yeah, I... I guess it did.

23:24.361 --> 23:29.449
It made me feel goodto, you know, to help.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.201
Even now.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.911
I'm from a generation

23:32.953 --> 23:35.372
who honors service.

23:35.413 --> 23:38.750
To our country, to each other.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.752
(sighs)

23:40.794 --> 23:43.839
Maybe that sounds old-fashionedto a lot of people.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.174
I don't know about that.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.759
Doesn't sound old-fashionedto me.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.845
But it does sound

23:49.886 --> 23:51.430
like a Thomas family trait.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.226
I like this one.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.310
(both laughing)

24:02.315 --> 24:04.317
Well, I hate to leavegood company,

24:04.317 --> 24:06.278
but I've got somework to catch up on.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.445
Oh, that's all right, Lucas.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.030
And thank you for today.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.282
No problem, Grandma.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.325
Same time next week.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.786
It was good to seeyou again, Susan.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.955
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.373
Me, too.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.504
Oh, here.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.505
Thank you.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.674
So what does...what does Lucas do?

24:27.674 --> 24:29.634
You don't know?

24:29.676 --> 24:31.636
He's a physical therapist.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.722
He's about to be published.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.265
Really?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.850
He wrote an exercise book.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.896
So, this has been lovely.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.189
What's next?

24:42.230 --> 24:43.607
Next?

24:43.648 --> 24:46.026
Uh, do you bring inthe cameras, or...?

24:46.067 --> 24:48.236
You're going to letme do the story!

24:48.278 --> 24:49.863
Oh, thank you!

24:49.905 --> 24:51.615
Sorry.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.325
Okay, um... Wow.

24:53.366 --> 24:55.952
Ultimately, we would justlike to get you on tape

24:55.994 --> 24:57.329
telling your sideof the story

24:57.370 --> 24:59.164
in your own words,but in the meantime...

24:59.206 --> 25:01.917
I don't much believein meantime.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.961
Life happens in real time.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.547
How soon do you want to start?

25:07.589 --> 25:11.468
CAROLINE:I hope it's okay if we dothe interview like this.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.887
I... I'll feel morenatural if I'm busy.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.472
Natural is perfect.

25:15.513 --> 25:16.932
Who could wantmore than natural?

25:16.973 --> 25:18.600
Okay, are you ready to start?

25:18.642 --> 25:21.645
Just in my own words?

25:21.686 --> 25:23.980
However you want to tell it.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.357
All right, uh...

25:25.398 --> 25:28.235
I guess we have to startat the beginning.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.279
Although with Neil and me

25:31.321 --> 25:34.032
it's hard to knowwhere it all began.

25:34.074 --> 25:38.245
Uh... I'd known him forever--since grade school.

25:38.286 --> 25:41.915
About a year before graduation,his family moved away,

25:41.915 --> 25:44.251
and we lost touch.

25:44.292 --> 25:47.003
I didn't seen him againtill '43.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.090
(big band music playing)

25:52.592 --> 25:55.262
By then, of course, the war was on.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.431
We planted victory gardens,

25:58.431 --> 26:01.977
collected scrap metal and rubber for recycling.

26:03.728 --> 26:06.940
Everywhere you looked, there was a reminder.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.192
Everyone seemed to have something to do

26:09.234 --> 26:11.903
behind the scenes for the war effort.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.822
That's because we all had

26:13.863 --> 26:16.283
someone we loved "over there."

26:18.118 --> 26:20.620
Folks put stars in their windows

26:20.662 --> 26:24.332
to show how many family members they had overseas.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.919
Everyone was united, bound together

26:27.961 --> 26:30.338
in a sense of patriotism.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.466
I was doing my part by working for the USO.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.559

Oh. You decide anything?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.240
Yeah, since when?

31:07.240 --> 31:11.828

31:55.330 --> 31:56.914
Yeah, he wasbeing scouted,

31:56.956 --> 31:59.292
and then he torehis rotator cuff.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.585
He thought his lifewas over,

32:00.627 --> 32:02.211

32:02.253 --> 32:04.923
Oh. You'll get himpitching again?Yeah.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.299
Eventually.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.592
It's a slow, hard recovery.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.886
It takes you off the fast trackof having to win.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.638
So, what about you?

32:11.679 --> 32:13.806
Do you miss the fast track?

32:13.806 --> 32:15.892
What do you mean?

32:15.933 --> 32:17.977
Sorry. I Googled you.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.896
Reporter. Bad habit.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.981
Okay. And what did you find?

32:21.981 --> 32:24.901
Well, Mr. Thomas,I read that you

32:24.942 --> 32:27.028
were a star point guardin college,

32:27.070 --> 32:28.154
and then afteryou graduated,

32:28.154 --> 32:29.989
you became a strength trainerfor the NBA,

32:29.989 --> 32:31.074
and a few yearsafter that,

32:31.115 --> 32:33.701
one day, suddenly,you just resigned.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.703
What happened?

32:35.745 --> 32:37.372
Pretty important jobto just walk away from.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.377
Um, well, uh...

32:42.418 --> 32:45.880
not if you lookat the people who do it.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.007
Um, many of them are divorced.

32:48.007 --> 32:51.010
Their kids barelyknow them.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.012
I just figuredI wanted more

32:53.054 --> 32:54.889
than travelingfrom city to city

32:54.931 --> 32:56.307
with a bunch of guys.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.600
And I... I thought

32:57.642 --> 33:01.771
that my grandmotherwas your subject here.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.649
Yeah. She is.

52:11.169 --> 52:12.587
No.

52:13.922 --> 52:17.801
But I think you have to.

52:17.843 --> 52:19.803
So...

52:26.143 --> 52:27.811
(sighs)

52:29.521 --> 52:32.524
SENATOR: Well, you have to knowwhat you stand for, don't you?

52:32.524 --> 52:36.528
And beyond that, a certaincourage of conviction.

52:36.570 --> 52:37.821
I've been blessed.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.030
And every struggle

52:39.072 --> 52:41.575
along the way has broughtits own rewards.

52:41.616 --> 52:43.285
But, hey, don't make itsound as if I'm through.

52:43.326 --> 52:46.121
I-I still intend to bemaking waves as long as

52:46.163 --> 52:47.205
the voters believe in me.

52:47.247 --> 52:49.875
For many years to come,I'm sure.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.710
That's great, guys.Thank you, Senator.

52:51.710 --> 52:54.129
Thank you for giving meso much of your time.My pleasure. My pleasure.

52:54.170 --> 52:56.631
Please let me know when it'sgoing to air, so I can watch it.

52:56.673 --> 52:58.258
And if there's anythingI can do for you

52:58.300 --> 53:00.385
while you're here in Washington,why, let me know.

53:00.427 --> 53:03.305
Thank you.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.348
You know, actually...

53:11.563 --> 53:14.190
(cell phone ringing)

53:14.232 --> 53:15.192
Hello.

53:15.233 --> 53:16.902
SENATOR:Ms. Allison? Max Irving.

53:16.943 --> 53:18.528
We found that informationfor you.

53:18.570 --> 53:20.155
(chuckles):Wow, that was fast.

53:20.197 --> 53:22.449
My assistant'se-mailing it to you now.

53:22.490 --> 53:24.201
Thank you, Senator, really.

53:24.242 --> 53:25.160
No problem.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.912
Sounds good.Great.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.747
(cell phone ringing)

53:28.788 --> 53:30.248
Hey, what's up?

53:30.248 --> 53:32.334
SUSAN: Hey, you know what?I need you to do me a favor.

53:32.375 --> 53:34.628
Uh, I'm gonnaforward you an e-mail.

53:34.669 --> 53:37.047
I need to know how to contactany living relatives

53:37.088 --> 53:39.758
of a man namedBillings, Jeffrey.

53:39.799 --> 53:41.051
Somewhere around Lubbock, Texas.

53:41.092 --> 53:42.052
(phone beeps)

53:42.093 --> 53:43.428
Ooh, that's Lucas.

53:43.470 --> 53:44.429
I got to go.

53:44.471 --> 53:45.472
Lucas?

53:45.513 --> 53:46.765
(dial tone)

53:46.765 --> 53:47.891
Hey.

53:47.933 --> 53:49.768
LUCAS:Hey.

53:49.768 --> 53:51.144
How's our girl?

53:51.186 --> 53:52.938
She's asleep right now.

53:52.938 --> 53:54.773
She's tougher than she looks.

53:54.814 --> 53:56.983
Sweetie.

53:57.025 --> 53:59.444
Thank you.

53:59.444 --> 54:02.530
And my, uh, my folksare in from New York,

54:02.572 --> 54:05.367
so that'll be a nice surprisefor her when she wakes up.

54:05.408 --> 54:06.660
How's D.C.?

54:06.701 --> 54:08.787
Uh, mission accomplished,actually.

54:08.828 --> 54:10.622
I'm changing my flightand heading to Texas.

54:10.664 --> 54:11.831
Texas?

54:11.873 --> 54:13.792
Do you know what was doneto find your grandfather

54:13.833 --> 54:16.211
after he was declared missing?

54:16.253 --> 54:18.338
Um, everything that couldbe done, I'm pretty sure.

54:18.380 --> 54:21.591
I know that my grandmotherstayed after the Navy for years.

54:21.633 --> 54:24.636
And did you know that there weretwo American survivors

54:24.678 --> 54:26.972
on the last missionthat your grandfather flew?

54:26.972 --> 54:27.931
Just one.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.349
A guy named Roberts.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.351
He's not a survivoranymore, though.

54:31.393 --> 54:34.562
He, uh, he died shortly afterhe came back stateside.

54:34.604 --> 54:36.147
Actually, there was another one.

54:36.147 --> 54:38.316
Guy by the name ofJeff Billings.

54:38.358 --> 54:40.110
The Navy had a reportthat he'd been rescued.

54:40.151 --> 54:41.653
Unfortunately, there wasa little paperwork snafu,

54:41.653 --> 54:44.990
and he was officially classifiedas killed in the line of duty,

54:44.990 --> 54:48.410
until seven years ago, when heactually died of natural causes.

54:48.451 --> 54:49.536
Then the paperwork gotstraightened out.

54:49.577 --> 54:50.996
And I'm guessingthat your grandmother

54:51.037 --> 54:52.330
had stopped looking by then.

54:52.372 --> 54:54.666
Not to mention, it was probablya little late for him

54:54.708 --> 54:56.501
to tell us anythingreally useful.

54:56.543 --> 55:01.506
Well, dead men talkall the time, Lucas.

55:22.652 --> 55:23.778
Hi.

55:23.820 --> 55:25.864
Mr. and Mrs.Billings?

55:25.905 --> 55:27.198
I'm Susan Allison.

55:27.198 --> 55:28.825
I spoke with you last nightfrom D.C.

55:28.867 --> 55:30.243
I'm Anne.

55:30.285 --> 55:31.202
Hi.

55:31.202 --> 55:32.162
And this is Glenn.

55:32.203 --> 55:33.621
How do you do, ma'am?

55:33.663 --> 55:34.956
You're thetelevision lady?

55:34.998 --> 55:36.708
Yeah, that's me.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.001
The television lady.

55:38.043 --> 55:40.336
(chuckles) Can I get yousomething to drink?

55:40.378 --> 55:41.379
SUSAN:I'm fine, really.

55:41.421 --> 55:44.716
Thank you for agreeingto speak to me.

55:46.885 --> 55:48.845
Don't know how muchwe can help you, ma'am.

55:48.887 --> 55:52.390
Um, I grew up listeningto all my daddy's war stories,

55:52.432 --> 55:54.517
and I do remember him talkingabout the lieutenant--

55:54.559 --> 55:55.977
that's who saved his life--

55:56.019 --> 55:58.772
but he never did knowwhat became of him.

55:58.813 --> 56:01.608
Wait a minute.

56:01.649 --> 56:04.319
Lieutenant Thomas savedyour father's life?

56:04.360 --> 56:05.236
Yes, ma'am.

56:05.236 --> 56:08.239
They got shot downover Manila Bay,

56:08.239 --> 56:10.784
and they was bothhit pretty bad.

56:10.825 --> 56:13.369
They parachuted to the ground,hid out in the jungle

56:13.411 --> 56:16.748
on the Bataan Peninsulauntil a local was able to get

56:16.790 --> 56:20.210
my daddy backto the Americans.

56:20.251 --> 56:22.462
Well, if they were ableto help your father,

56:22.504 --> 56:24.547
then how comeLieutenant Thomas...?

56:24.589 --> 56:25.924
They had this little cart.

56:25.924 --> 56:27.967
It was only big enoughto hide one man,

56:28.009 --> 56:31.471
and the lieutenantrefused to go.

56:31.513 --> 56:32.597
He said my daddy was

56:32.639 --> 56:34.432
way worse than he was,and they could just

56:34.474 --> 56:38.269
send somebody back after him.

56:38.311 --> 56:40.605
It's all in the letter.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.441
What letter?

56:43.483 --> 56:45.193
It was the first letter

56:45.235 --> 56:49.280
my daddy wrote back homeafter he got rescued.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.782
Anyway, that...

56:50.782 --> 56:53.618
that was the last timemy daddy saw the lieutenant.

56:53.618 --> 56:56.704
Tried to look him up after thewar, but all he could find out

56:56.746 --> 56:59.499
was that he'd been listedas missing in action.

56:59.541 --> 57:02.418
So Lieutenant Thomasjust stayed there in the jungle?

57:02.460 --> 57:03.545
Well, they'dmet some men.

57:03.586 --> 57:06.881
Tribesmen and a coupleof rebel fighters.

57:06.923 --> 57:09.634
At least he wasn't alone.

57:09.634 --> 57:10.927
Here you go, honey.

57:10.969 --> 57:12.429
My daddy wrote it all down.

57:16.558 --> 57:19.352
And I think my mama kept it inthe Bible,

57:19.394 --> 57:21.896
just to remind herself thateverything's in God's hands.

57:30.071 --> 57:32.073
I think mydaddy would want

57:32.115 --> 57:36.077
the lieutenant's wifeto have that, ma'am.

57:39.289 --> 57:40.415
MAN:Here we go.

57:40.456 --> 57:42.709
(chuckles)Home at last, huh?

57:42.750 --> 57:44.002
Hey, you!

57:44.043 --> 57:45.628
Hey. I heard the hospitallet you go

57:45.670 --> 57:47.714
'cause you were too muchfor them to handle.

57:47.755 --> 57:48.673
(chuckles)

57:48.715 --> 57:50.008
How are you?

57:50.008 --> 57:52.510
Oh, glad to see you,that's how I am.

57:52.552 --> 57:54.846
Welcome back.Soon as you put himdown, we can talk.

57:54.846 --> 57:56.139
Oh.(laughter)

57:56.181 --> 57:58.057
Let me introduce youto my parents.

57:58.099 --> 57:59.350
This ismy mother Maggie.

57:59.392 --> 58:00.894
Hi.That's my father Neil, Jr.This is Susan.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.187
Hi, nice tomeet you.Hi.

58:02.187 --> 58:03.730
I feel as ifwe already know you

58:03.771 --> 58:04.981
just from watching your show.

58:05.023 --> 58:06.107
Oh, I'm gladyou enjoy it.

58:06.149 --> 58:08.902
I have a surprise for you.

58:27.212 --> 58:31.132
Neil, your father savedthis man's life.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.717
He had a chanceto be rescued,

58:32.717 --> 58:35.678
and he put the man's life first.

58:35.720 --> 58:39.849
SUSAN:Jeff Billings never knewwhat became of your husband,

58:39.891 --> 58:42.894
but in that letter,he mentions a tribesman, Morang.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.395
I'm gonnacheck it out.

58:44.437 --> 58:46.731
Do you think it's possibleyou could find him?

58:46.773 --> 58:50.401
Somebody somewhere knowswhat happened in that jungle.

58:50.401 --> 58:51.653
And I'm gonna find out.

58:53.696 --> 58:54.906
I promise.

59:00.161 --> 59:02.038
You promised?It was a bitoptimistic, I admit,

59:02.080 --> 59:03.456
but I still thinkI can do it.

59:03.498 --> 59:05.083
And with your own workbeing so totally irrelevant.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.125
Um, this is my work.

59:06.167 --> 59:07.669
You're the one whoput me on the story.

59:07.710 --> 59:08.962
And I took you off.Remember that part?

59:09.003 --> 59:10.171
Yeah, but I thinkif you and I...No.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.215
Please, justlet me explain.No. No.

59:12.257 --> 59:14.884
(sighs)

59:14.926 --> 59:16.344
Fine.

59:16.386 --> 59:18.263
Then you know what,I'll see you in a week.

59:18.304 --> 59:20.098
It's been three yearssince I've had a vacation,

59:20.139 --> 59:21.432
and I'm feelinga bit run down.

59:21.474 --> 59:22.517
Are you serious?Yep.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.981
Job might not be herewhen you get back.

59:28.022 --> 59:29.774
Okay.

59:29.774 --> 59:31.484
If that's how you feel.

59:36.030 --> 59:38.866
Can you reason with her?

59:41.703 --> 59:45.873
I never side with Craig, butall you have is a man's name.

59:45.915 --> 59:47.625
No. Actually,I have a place.

59:47.625 --> 59:49.127
Bataan Peninsula.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.795
Yeah, but you don'tknow he's from there.

59:50.837 --> 59:51.838
Morang was a native.

59:51.879 --> 59:53.423
The-The letter saysthat he was a native.

59:53.464 --> 59:55.008
So? I'm a nativeof New Jersey.

59:55.049 --> 59:56.134
This is notNew Jersey.

59:56.134 --> 59:58.386
Look, I am not gonnalet Caroline Thomas die

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.763
without the answersthat she has been looking for.

01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:04.017
Because you're fallingfor her grandson.

01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:06.436
Wow. You know what,I teetered on the brink,

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:08.646
but Caroline--I care about her.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:10.315
Susan, whathappened?

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:11.316
What happened?!

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:14.444
Nothing.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.279
Almost nothing.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.238
What about Andrew?

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.614
I am working on it, okay?

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:19.949
And I'm gonnaback away from Lucas.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.285
Okay, because you seem toreally like this guy...

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.495
Look, can we just talk aboutsomething else, okay?

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:26.372
I'm backing away from Lucas.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:27.457
Look at me.

01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:28.666
Backing.

01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:30.335
No Lucas.

01:00:30.376 --> 01:00:31.377
Got it.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.219
Hey.

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:41.679
Hey.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:45.099
Brought yousomething.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:49.854
This will keep youflexible, healthy

01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:53.358
and hopefully...happy.

01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:54.525
Wow.

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:55.693
It does all that?

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:58.488
Well, it will, soon as Iteach you how to use it.

01:00:58.529 --> 01:01:01.240
Well, I-I can't accept it.

01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:04.786
Look, I know how busyyou are with work,

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.163
and now you're runningaround for my grandmother.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.332
I just, I thought,when does she have time

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:12.418
to take careof herself?

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.754
I run.

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:17.173
It also comeswith flowers.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.759
Just a friendlyreminder

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.886
to take a moment, stop,

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:25.932
lean forward, with your spineproperly aligned and...

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:27.100
smell the roses.

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:30.144
I love roses.

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:33.731
I can't.

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:35.191
Why not?

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.734
It's just a gift.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:37.902
For all you've done.

01:01:37.902 --> 01:01:42.281
I think maybe we shouldjust keep this friendly.

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:46.911
Friendly.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:47.954
Okay.

01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:50.248
Friendly, it is.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:01.384
I like you.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:11.436
But I am involvedwith someone else.

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:14.939
And I...

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.774
(sighs)

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:19.610
...need to decide how Ifeel about him-him first.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:20.862
Mm-hmm.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:25.116
You had to go and say that,didn't you?

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:27.076
Now I just like you more.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:32.457
(engine starts)

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:42.008
(water running)

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:43.676

01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:50.975
(spits)

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:57.231
SUSAN:Is that as exact as you can get?

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.984
Just "north of Orion Bataan"?

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:01.986
Okay, well, what aboutthe map coordinates?

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:05.615
Did the pilot notethe coordinates?

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:07.366
Uh-huh.

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.248
Didn't I tell you?

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:17.877
You're right, Mom.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.504
Look at allthis stuff. Wow!

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:21.547
Oh, I couldn't be more proud.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.759
I don't know. It's a littleembarrassing, if you ask me.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.136
Why?

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.305
I just hope that we geta big enough crowd.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.224
I mean, who's gonna want

01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:33.309
a signed copy ofan exercise book?

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.561
You have helpedso many people.

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:36.938
They want to meet you.

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.773
MAGGIE:And we'll be here.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.359
Why not ask Susan?

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.027
Oh, she's cute.

01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:44.654
Okay, you guys, stop,all right?

01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:46.113
She's got a boyfriend.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.281
It's not gonna happen.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.241
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:50.284
It looked like therewas something there.

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:52.787
No, there'snothing there.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.747
Oh, I agree with Grandma.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.375
She looked interestedto me.

01:03:57.416 --> 01:04:00.253
Well, she mentionedsome other guy acouple times now.

01:04:00.294 --> 01:04:01.838

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:04.757
Well, don't be soquick to dismiss it.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:09.053
You like her, I can tell.

01:04:09.053 --> 01:04:14.058
Maybe this person she talksabout isn't the one.

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:21.399
(doorbell rings)

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.493
Hey!Hey.

What are you doing here?!

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.371
I got back a day early.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:37.248
Well, I wish that youwould have called me,

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.166
'cause I could'vecome and picked you up.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:42.420
Well, if you want,I'll let you driveme back tomorrow.

01:04:42.461 --> 01:04:44.505

Let me, let me start over.I am sorry.

01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:53.764
I've been on a planefor 12 hours,

01:04:53.764 --> 01:04:54.891

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:56.809
Okay.

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:03.482
Wow.

01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:05.818
Why all the research?

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.570
Is that Bataan?

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:08.696
What's going on?

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.615
Remember the storythat I told you

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:12.283
I was doing about the lady

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:14.285
whose husband she lost inWorld War II?

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.537
Yeah.Well, I'm tryingto help her find him.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.955
After 60 years?

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.291
Yeah, except now I knowwhere he was

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.668
and the name of the manwho saw him last.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.295
Morang...Mm-hmm.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.213
Do you still haveany contacts in

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.549

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.927
Uh, yeah, I still have

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:32.803
a few contacts there.

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:35.306
I haven't spoken to themin a while, though.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:37.975
You know, it'sthe love of her life,

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:39.685
and she still has no idea

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:41.145
what happened to him.

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:45.149
Well, hey, that's allyou had to say.

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:47.443

I'm sorry, Andrew.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.330
We're just not ready.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:01.832
Yeah.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:04.126
I was hoping that maybe, uh...

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:08.965
But I had a feeling.

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:11.217
We're just not therefor each other.

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:14.470
And that's not... that'snot your fault, andit's not my fault.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:17.556
It just...it is what it is.

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:22.061

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.313
No.

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:27.650
Why-Why would you...?

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:32.154

But... what about us?

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.843
Shouldn't we talk about that?

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:55.386
Not right now.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.430

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:16.034
MORANG:Thomas kept a picture of you and his baby boy,

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:18.537

him asking God to keep you safe.

01:14:58.702 --> 01:15:02.998
Thomas got stronger by the dayand joined us.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.877
Sometimes, enemy Japanesepatrols would come by.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.922
If we saw them,we would kill them.

01:15:09.963 --> 01:15:11.798
Sometimes,they would forget to come,

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.385
so we would go looking.

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:33.695
It's all right, Morang.

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:35.864

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:31.284
I'd like it if you would.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.288
Uh, after your book signing,

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.666
I kind of thought you neverwanted to see me again.

01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:39.209
I... I'm sorry.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:40.961
I guess I was justa little disappointed

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.671
after I saw youwith your boyfriend.

01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:44.172
What? When was that?

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:46.049
Couple daysbefore the book signing.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.384
You were with some guy.

You were hugging himwith some enthusiasm.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.474
Yeah, that... that wasn't...

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:57.894

from what I understand.

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:24.629
