00:00.029 --> 00:00.968
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...

00:01.054 --> 00:03.039
<i>Atlantix FC
is all about community.</i>

00:03.125 --> 00:06.195
- Who killed my child?
- I'm sorry for you and your wife,

00:06.281 --> 00:07.679
<i>but I had nothing
to do with it.</i>

00:07.789 --> 00:10.665
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Steven is in Paris.

00:10.751 --> 00:11.953
I just came here to get away,

00:12.039 --> 00:12.984
and I'm already
feeling much better

00:13.070 --> 00:14.257
<i>thanks to my friend George.</i>

00:14.343 --> 00:16.181
I don't know what's going on.
He's real, isn't he?

00:16.265 --> 00:17.540
I think I want to talk
to someone.

00:17.625 --> 00:18.554
<i>We're gonna get you help.</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:20.515
All this started
to see firsthand

00:20.601 --> 00:22.023
the life that I've been denied,

00:22.109 --> 00:23.906
<i>and now I'm gonna claim it.</i>

00:24.062 --> 00:28.437
Hank, if you're seeing this,
please call me.

00:28.804 --> 00:30.460
We will get through this
together.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.031
All I wanted was to make him
stop crying!

00:33.117 --> 00:34.625
Hey, hey, hey.

00:34.726 --> 00:36.640
...until
I heard the evidence.

00:37.015 --> 00:38.124
Fingerprints...

00:38.210 --> 00:40.023
Pain's pretty bad today?

00:41.546 --> 00:42.757
Mom, no, no, no.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.648
Look, I think y-you've
had enough pills.

00:44.781 --> 00:45.961
Why-why don't you try
going to sleep.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.420
No, don't touch that.

00:47.516 --> 00:48.859
I-I can't be alone.

00:48.945 --> 00:51.603
- You-you can't leave. No...
- Mom, Mom, it's okay, it's okay.

00:51.689 --> 00:53.812
- You can't leave.
- It's okay.

00:54.164 --> 00:55.218
I'm here.

00:55.304 --> 00:59.515
You're my baby.
He's a fake.

01:00.898 --> 01:02.305
That's not Adam.

01:03.445 --> 01:04.890
Mom, what're you talking about?

01:04.976 --> 01:06.882
He's not their real son, Mikey.

01:06.968 --> 01:08.422
<i>You mean Cristal Flores?</i>

01:08.507 --> 01:10.818
<i>- Who is she really?</i>
- You are.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.763
Blake.

01:23.580 --> 01:24.663
I'm fine.

01:24.841 --> 01:27.794
Had, uh, insomnia's best friend

01:27.880 --> 01:28.943
here to keep me company.

01:29.029 --> 01:30.726
- Were you up all night again?
- Half the night.

01:30.811 --> 01:32.232
You should've woken me.

01:32.422 --> 01:34.389
I did everything I could
to get back to sleep,

01:34.506 --> 01:37.450
my mind just kept playing, oh,
what I did that night,

01:37.536 --> 01:38.716
over and over and over.

01:38.802 --> 01:40.903
Then it went to
a really dark place

01:41.442 --> 01:42.990
of the monster
you must think I am.

01:43.076 --> 01:44.320
No.

01:48.031 --> 01:49.823
You know I don't
think that.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.086
Knock, knock, Daddy.
It is after 8:00,

01:56.252 --> 01:57.961
which is normally
lunchtime for you,

01:58.047 --> 02:01.656
but you are, uh, sleeping in
and drinking in again,

02:01.742 --> 02:03.164
which would be cute

02:03.250 --> 02:05.398
in a pre-newlywed-y sort of way

02:05.484 --> 02:07.124
if it weren't worrying
the hell out of me.

02:07.359 --> 02:10.264
Okay, I am gonna
leave you two alone.

02:10.616 --> 02:12.133
There's nothing
to worry about.

02:12.414 --> 02:14.548
I'm just having trouble sleeping
because I've got business things

02:14.633 --> 02:15.944
- on my mind.
- Oh, please.

02:16.030 --> 02:17.743
If you truly were busy
with business,

02:17.829 --> 02:20.336
then you wouldn't be wearing
silk pajamas past sunrise.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.914
Don't act brave
for me, Daddy.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.584
You have been through
a lot lately,

02:24.928 --> 02:27.512
with the baby and Mark Jennings,

02:27.598 --> 02:29.101
so why don't you just
allow yourself

02:29.201 --> 02:31.398
to feel your
"mourning sickness"

02:31.484 --> 02:33.568
and let me take care of you
in the meantime.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.281
That was, uh, "mourning"
with a "U,"

02:36.417 --> 02:38.078
in case it
went over your...

02:38.164 --> 02:40.648
I just want to help, Dad.
By insulting me in my bedroom?

02:40.734 --> 02:42.000
I mean, like you always say,

02:42.086 --> 02:43.984
tragedy brings us
closer together.

02:44.070 --> 02:45.611
- For a minute.
- And in this minute,

02:45.697 --> 02:47.172
I am here
for you, okay?

02:47.258 --> 02:49.039
Just on call 24/7,

02:49.125 --> 02:51.289
conferring with Anders
about household management,

02:51.375 --> 02:53.976
I'll even keep Alexis at bay
until you're back on top,

02:54.413 --> 02:56.399
- and out of your jammies.
- You are so transparent.

02:56.484 --> 02:58.048
That's an interesting word
for thoughtful.

02:58.133 --> 02:59.711
I know why you're
so gung ho to help.

02:59.797 --> 03:03.054
You feel guilty that you were
away visiting Steven in Paraguay

03:03.148 --> 03:04.818
while Cristal and I were taking
care of everything here

03:04.903 --> 03:06.016
in the house.
Well, there's no need to.

03:06.101 --> 03:08.031
Everything is absolutely fine.

03:10.377 --> 03:11.429
Mm...

03:12.914 --> 03:14.664
So? Did you tell him
about Steven?

03:14.750 --> 03:15.996
Of course I didn't.

03:16.081 --> 03:17.829
With everything that's going on,
he doesn't need to hear

03:17.914 --> 03:19.265
that his son
has gone insane

03:19.351 --> 03:20.960
and checked himself
into a mental institution.

03:21.045 --> 03:22.628
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.

03:22.714 --> 03:23.836
We all remember
his meltdown

03:23.922 --> 03:25.461
after First Generation
Cristal died.

03:25.547 --> 03:28.179
Okay, we can't risk having him
go back to Dark Blake.

03:28.273 --> 03:30.403
Fallon,
I'm not a good liar, okay?

03:30.489 --> 03:31.820
You know it. I know it.

03:31.906 --> 03:33.352
The gazillions of people
I've lied to know it.

03:33.437 --> 03:35.789
We promised Steven that
we would keep it a secret,

03:35.889 --> 03:37.472
that that is what
is best for him.

03:37.558 --> 03:39.188
And now we need to do
what's best for Blake.

03:39.273 --> 03:40.916
And I'm also doing
what's best for you.

03:41.002 --> 03:43.226
- By torturing me?
- No, by feeding you.

03:43.312 --> 03:44.774
I have hired VIP catering

03:44.860 --> 03:46.610
of all the best comfort
foods in Atlanta

03:46.714 --> 03:48.640
because I know if I want
to keep your mouth shut,

03:48.726 --> 03:49.734
I've got to keep it full.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.101
But for now you and I
will not be responsible

03:52.187 --> 03:55.180
for bringing any more
grief into this house.

03:55.266 --> 03:56.765
I need to shelter my dad.

03:56.922 --> 03:59.320
No more drama. Okay?

04:02.854 --> 04:04.562
What catering?

04:04.647 --> 04:08.808
Giving back to the community
was never really on my radar.

04:08.893 --> 04:11.427
But after a recent epiphany,

04:11.512 --> 04:13.887
I bought the land
to turn it into this

04:13.972 --> 04:15.472
center for learning and arts,

04:15.557 --> 04:17.766
designed specifically
to help low-income families,

04:17.851 --> 04:19.135
kids like I was once.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.394
We all know they're not
given enough opportunities

04:21.480 --> 04:22.521
to thrive.

04:22.606 --> 04:23.591
We are failing them.

04:23.677 --> 04:26.429
So, here's an opportunity
for us to do something about it.

04:26.692 --> 04:29.753
Rezoning 70 acres
in Adams Park

04:29.839 --> 04:32.781
is an ambitious proposal,
Mr. Colby.

04:32.866 --> 04:34.500
You approve projects like this
all the time

04:34.585 --> 04:36.452
in different parts of the city.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.120
Look, I am fully
funding this one

04:38.205 --> 04:40.098
and not taking a
penny of profit.

04:40.183 --> 04:42.291
All I need,
all the community needs,

04:42.376 --> 04:44.418
is your approval
when you vote tomorrow

04:44.503 --> 04:47.129
so we can start changing lives.

04:47.214 --> 04:49.076
Everybody wins here.

04:49.162 --> 04:50.568
Thank you, Mr. Colby.

04:50.654 --> 04:53.322
We vote tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.
Until then,

04:53.408 --> 04:55.349
- we are adjourned. 
- Nice job, Mr. Colby.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.979
Good luck tomorrow.

05:00.185 --> 05:02.936
Impressive presentation, man.

05:03.021 --> 05:04.943
Colby Music and Arts Center.

05:05.029 --> 05:06.521
It's not about me.

05:06.767 --> 05:10.277
I'm not Blake trumpeting his
Carrington Family Foundation.

05:10.362 --> 05:12.488
My name isn't even going on this
'cause I don't want

05:12.573 --> 05:14.540
anyone feeling like
they owe me anything.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.492
That's how Blake made me feel
my whole life.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.452
It's a beautiful thing, man.
Look,

05:18.537 --> 05:19.828
I know we've had our issues,

05:19.913 --> 05:22.956
but, uh,
I'm a positive man now, okay?

05:23.041 --> 05:24.666
So I don't need you
showing up here

05:24.751 --> 05:26.477
and reminding me
of being betrayed.

05:26.562 --> 05:28.170
That's not what I'm here to do.

05:28.255 --> 05:29.838
Trust me.

05:29.923 --> 05:31.724
I want things
to be good between us.

05:31.809 --> 05:34.676
Okay. So, why are you here?

05:34.761 --> 05:38.680
I'm here to make FC Atlantix

05:38.765 --> 05:40.998
your first official sponsor.

05:41.084 --> 05:43.771
This is about giving the
kids music and arts, Mike.

05:43.878 --> 05:46.387
Not slapping some corporate
logo on their backs.

05:46.582 --> 05:47.981
I thought it was
about changing lives.

05:48.066 --> 05:49.909
That's what sports can do.
It did it for me.

05:49.994 --> 05:51.610
Kept me off the streets
and out of trouble.

05:51.695 --> 05:54.154
Gave me goals and focus.

05:54.239 --> 05:57.818
We'll have the team mentor
the kids in after-school sports.

05:57.904 --> 06:00.034
It's great for the community.
Great PR

06:00.120 --> 06:01.921
for the organization,
and, like you said,

06:02.006 --> 06:03.529
everybody wins here.

06:03.637 --> 06:05.707
You know I'm a silent partner
in the Atlantix, right?

06:05.792 --> 06:07.146
It's perfect synergy.

06:07.232 --> 06:09.904
We join programs.
Make the world a better place.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.723
I'm already tied to
Blake on one business,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.973
and I don't want him
anywhere near this one.

06:16.104 --> 06:18.956
I don't need you or him to
make the world a better place.

06:42.943 --> 06:44.826
What are you doing?

06:45.865 --> 06:47.701
Learning about my real family.

06:47.787 --> 06:49.829
Well, you-you look
like a stalker.

06:50.052 --> 06:51.763
Is that better or worse
than a kidnapper?

06:51.848 --> 06:54.408
It was my boyfriend
who kidnapped you.

06:54.493 --> 06:55.474
He was a monster.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.653
And he sure wasn't gonna
put up with a crying baby,

06:57.738 --> 06:59.655
so I took you,
and I ran away.

06:59.740 --> 07:01.523
I saved you from being killed.

07:01.608 --> 07:03.751
You could've returned me
to the Carringtons at any point.

07:03.836 --> 07:05.216
I could've been
sent to prison.

07:05.302 --> 07:07.135
- I was scared.
- Shut up!

07:07.629 --> 07:09.905
You stole my life,
the life I was owed.

07:09.991 --> 07:11.500
And-and a father.
No.

07:11.585 --> 07:14.503
It's not like that.
I did everything

07:14.588 --> 07:16.097
because I love you.

07:16.182 --> 07:20.083
Call it plain motherly
overprotectiveness.

07:20.168 --> 07:21.652
No. No, you're a liar.

07:21.737 --> 07:24.087
If you loved me, you wouldn't
have lied to me my whole life.

07:24.172 --> 07:25.797
<i>You're</i> the monster.

07:25.882 --> 07:28.258
Don't you talk
to me like that.

07:28.343 --> 07:30.093
I am your mother, Mikey.

07:30.178 --> 07:32.262
Don't call me that!
I am not Mikey!

07:32.347 --> 07:33.989
And you are not my mother!
Oh!

07:54.678 --> 07:56.803
Thank you.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.886
Oh, you must be
Sam's sushi table.

08:03.971 --> 08:05.062
I know you charge
by the hour,

08:05.147 --> 08:06.555
but the main thing
to know about Sam

08:06.640 --> 08:09.341
is that he eats in record time,
so I'm thinking a flat fee

08:09.426 --> 08:11.009
might be the best way
to handle this.

08:11.094 --> 08:12.561
I'm sorry, I'm not
Sam's sushi table,

08:12.646 --> 08:14.012
if that's a thing.

08:14.097 --> 08:15.472
Then who are you?

08:15.557 --> 08:17.307
I'm Adam.

08:17.392 --> 08:19.034
Hmm.

08:20.562 --> 08:24.356
So, Adam, you have a last name?

08:24.441 --> 08:26.625
Carrington.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.654
I'm your brother.

08:30.739 --> 08:33.198
Ugh. Anders? Security?

08:33.283 --> 08:34.249
Do we even have
security anymore?

08:34.333 --> 08:35.417
You don't need
to call security.

08:35.501 --> 08:37.510
I just want to see
Blake, my father.

08:37.596 --> 08:38.679
Oh, we have
another lunatic here, do we?

08:38.764 --> 08:39.871
Look, I swear,

08:39.956 --> 08:41.474
any other day,
we would be

08:41.558 --> 08:43.350
very open
to have you scam us.

08:43.434 --> 08:45.168
But my dad is a mess,
and he does not need

08:45.253 --> 08:46.545
any more stress right now.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.713
So maybe you can, I don't know,
come back in a month,

08:48.798 --> 08:49.915
and we can go from there?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.550
I'm not scamming you.
And I'm not leaving.

08:51.635 --> 08:54.102
I've come a long way.
Okay, I asked you politely.

08:54.187 --> 08:55.845
Just listen to me. Give me five minutes.
But we do have a gun room.

08:55.930 --> 08:56.888
I can explain everything.
No, no, no.

08:56.973 --> 08:58.223
I'm not gonna
give you five minutes.

08:58.308 --> 09:00.350
- Anders, please? Dad? 
- Anders, what's going on?

09:00.435 --> 09:02.227
What on earth is happening?

09:02.312 --> 09:03.353
This Mr. Ripley here

09:03.438 --> 09:05.230
claims that he is Adam.

09:05.315 --> 09:06.898
But you're a year late, dude.

09:06.983 --> 09:08.900
The Adam ship
has sailed, docked

09:08.985 --> 09:10.265
and already set fire
to the loft.

09:11.523 --> 09:14.223
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

09:14.824 --> 09:16.124
Or a rattle.

09:16.209 --> 09:18.410
Where did you get that?

09:18.495 --> 09:20.387
From the woman who told me
that she was my mother.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.722
But now I know
I'm your son.

09:21.807 --> 09:23.265
Your real son.

09:25.644 --> 09:27.752
So much for no more drama.

09:28.748 --> 09:30.599

<font color=#00FF00>Season 02 Episode 15</font>

09:30.685 --> 09:33.220
Episode Title:
<font color=#FFFF00>"Motherly Overprotectiveness"</font>

09:34.541 --> 09:37.126
It was the most heartbreaking
moment of my life,

09:37.236 --> 09:39.493
learning that
I wasn't her real son.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.048
Learning that my
life was a lie,

09:42.134 --> 09:45.035
and learning that my name
was Adam Carrington,

09:45.120 --> 09:45.946
not Mikey Harrison.

09:46.032 --> 09:47.548
And this is the
part where you learn

09:47.633 --> 09:49.240
I think you're full of it.

09:49.499 --> 09:51.532
I'm having
the strangest déjà vu.

09:51.618 --> 09:53.848
I don't understand.
What about Hank?

09:53.934 --> 09:56.376
Oh, right. That's why.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.487
Hank is the real Adam.

09:57.572 --> 10:01.032
You're just... too late.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.224
And you have ten fingers.

10:02.309 --> 10:04.059
My mother also told me
about that,

10:04.144 --> 10:06.112
how the kidnappers took a finger
from the morgue

10:06.197 --> 10:08.230
and sent it to you,
claiming it was mine.

10:08.315 --> 10:09.223
It wasn't.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.858
I'm sorry, but
Hank was a fraud,

10:10.943 --> 10:13.694
and it's one of the reasons
I came, to tell you.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.239
So, you decided to sit on
your ass for four months

10:17.324 --> 10:18.483
instead of warning us?

10:18.568 --> 10:19.709
I would've come sooner,
but I didn't want

10:19.794 --> 10:21.035
my mother to get arrested.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.245
But then she passed away.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.080
Yeah, I know that
sounds crazy.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.707
No, it doesn't.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.750
Sounds noble.

10:27.835 --> 10:28.926
Are you high?

10:29.011 --> 10:31.012
Okay, am I the only one
that thinks

10:31.097 --> 10:33.898
that Hank's positive DNA test
trumps this cliché

10:33.983 --> 10:36.592
Nicholas Sparks novel and
an old tarnished baby rattle?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.719
This old baby rattle
was my mother's, it was mine.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.930
Guess what else
was your mother's? DNA.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.740
Fallon, I just feel it
in my gut.

10:42.825 --> 10:44.558
A father knows his son.

10:44.643 --> 10:46.393
Really? What's Steven's
favorite color?

10:46.478 --> 10:47.695
- Pink.
- No.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.272
I think your gut feeling
is you not wanting

10:50.357 --> 10:52.441
that creep Hank
to be your spawn.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.692
You heard
everything he said.

10:53.777 --> 10:55.161
The events of that night.

10:55.246 --> 10:56.403
The case
was handled privately.

10:56.488 --> 10:57.647
How could he have gotten
all that information?

10:57.732 --> 10:59.740
How would Hank?
Hank didn't know half of it.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.759
Which makes me think that
he faked his DNA results.

11:01.844 --> 11:04.095
Well, I don't know
that that's possible.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.455
Is it? I'm more than
happy to take a DNA test.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.724
In front of you,

11:07.809 --> 11:09.917
if that's what you need.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.294
And I'm not looking
for a payout or anything.

11:12.379 --> 11:13.545
Yeah, you say that now.

11:13.630 --> 11:15.106
In a week, you'll
be drowning yourself

11:15.191 --> 11:16.465
in king crab
and Gucci loafers.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.788
No offense.
Offense taken.

11:18.874 --> 11:20.248
I have a happy life.

11:20.512 --> 11:22.137
And I plan on
going back to it.

11:22.222 --> 11:24.998
Dad, I think you need
to rest.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.281
This is too much
to handle for anyone.

11:27.367 --> 11:28.109
I'm so sorry.

11:28.265 --> 11:29.812
He's been through a lot lately.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.197
Yeah, yeah, we...

11:31.282 --> 11:32.957
we lost a baby.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.609
And Hank, who I thought
was my son, and Steven,

11:35.694 --> 11:37.361
who I also thought
was my son,

11:37.446 --> 11:38.963
has run away
to Paraguay to live.

11:39.048 --> 11:40.823
Yes, he's, um...

11:40.908 --> 11:43.292
he's been in Paraguay
this whole time

11:43.377 --> 11:45.902
doing...
good for the communities

11:45.988 --> 11:47.997
and, uh, he's building...

11:48.082 --> 11:49.298
wells and houses.

11:49.383 --> 11:51.667
Yeah. Lot of good stuff.
And more wells.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.394
- He's such a giver.
- Paraguay, huh?

11:53.596 --> 11:55.294
Oh, that's, that's a shame.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.840
I was... really looking forward
to meeting him.

11:57.925 --> 11:58.926
All right, here's how
this is gonna go.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.941
I am gonna tell Anders
to book you a room

12:01.027 --> 12:03.941
at a Motel... S-Seven or Eight.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.222
Or whatever,
I don't care.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.565
And then maybe,
if the DNA test

12:06.650 --> 12:08.642
results are positive,
we will move you to a Ritz.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.827
But for now,

12:09.912 --> 12:12.146
I am perfectly fine
being the only child.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.488
You really shouldn't
have come here, young man.

12:15.409 --> 12:17.192
No. Enough.

12:17.277 --> 12:18.861
He's our son.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.863
I can feel it
in my heart.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.841
But because I know
you don't have a heart,

12:24.230 --> 12:26.245
we'll do a DNA test.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.046
Isn't it incredible?

12:37.131 --> 12:39.598
You not going
for the alcohol? Yes.

12:39.683 --> 12:41.434
I don't need it.

12:41.519 --> 12:42.718
I'm happy.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.277
You don't think
I'm jumping into this?

12:45.363 --> 12:48.191
I know it when I know it.
That's Adam. That's my son.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.893
These last days have been
nothing short of a...

12:50.978 --> 12:52.245
nightmare for us.

12:52.331 --> 12:55.238
But I think this is what I
needed to get my mind at ease.

12:56.102 --> 12:57.986
What is it?

13:06.302 --> 13:08.077
Okay,
that was about

13:08.162 --> 13:09.211
30 seconds.

13:09.296 --> 13:11.038
I don't think
they have a chip for that.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.973
Did you see this?

13:15.335 --> 13:19.421
"Pre-site approval
request denied."

13:19.506 --> 13:21.715
It means I can't build my stadium.
I can read.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.926
I know what it means.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.464
- I'm sure you can call someone.
- That's only when

13:26.550 --> 13:27.692
there's other people in my way.

13:27.777 --> 13:29.598
This time, I'm competing
with Mother Nature

13:29.683 --> 13:32.151
and-and her
"unsustainable resources

13:32.236 --> 13:34.937
that will damage the environment
in the surrounding area."

13:35.022 --> 13:36.105
Blah, blah, blah.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.606
I can't risk going
through with this,

13:37.691 --> 13:39.441
not after the scandal
in Clarke County.

13:39.526 --> 13:41.401
There must be another place
in Atlanta you can find.

13:41.486 --> 13:43.612
I have one month to find
another site in the area

13:43.697 --> 13:45.831
or they will cancel my bid
and I will lose the team.

13:45.916 --> 13:48.450
And I can't lose another
thing, Cristal. I can't.

13:48.535 --> 13:49.701
Okay, stop spinning out.

13:49.786 --> 13:50.911
Let me handle it.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.546
You?
<i>¿Perdón?</i>

13:52.631 --> 13:53.997
Yes, me.

13:54.082 --> 13:55.457
You said that you didn't
want a part of any of this.

13:55.542 --> 13:58.210
And I also said I wanted
to paint our nursery yellow,

13:58.295 --> 14:00.295
but I can't have that, right?

14:00.380 --> 14:02.631
And if I can't have
the future we planned,

14:02.716 --> 14:06.135
I need to start building
a new one or I'm gonna go crazy.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.469
And handling my team
is the way to do that?

14:07.554 --> 14:09.805
Our team.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.975
I already helped run a team
for my family.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.309
Exactly.

14:14.394 --> 14:16.287
And you said you were miserable

14:16.372 --> 14:17.488
and that they were
horrible people.

14:17.573 --> 14:19.815
Which is why they're not
in my life anymore.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.817
But I still know
how to do the job.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.494
Let me handle it.

14:23.579 --> 14:26.488
Trust that I know what to do
with the family I love.

14:26.573 --> 14:28.782
God knows, I could use
the time to bond with my son.

14:28.867 --> 14:32.286
And while you take care
of <i> your</i> dynasty,

14:32.371 --> 14:35.222
I'll take care of ours.

14:37.343 --> 14:38.292
<i>Since when are you</i>

14:38.377 --> 14:39.577
representing the team?

14:39.662 --> 14:42.004
Since Blake bought it for me
as an engagement gift.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.886
Do you want a play-by-play
of our relationship

14:43.971 --> 14:45.007
or can we talk about land?

14:45.092 --> 14:46.818
Can we? Because I'm in charge

14:46.903 --> 14:49.320
of player relations,
Cristal, not infrastructure.

14:49.405 --> 14:51.346
Or do you want a play-by-play
of how the business works?

14:51.431 --> 14:54.349
Nice. But I already have my eyes
on another piece of land.

14:54.434 --> 14:56.026
The perfect piece
of land.

14:56.111 --> 14:57.978
It's actually
in the same neighborhood.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.688
Jeff's land.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.157
Is that why you came
to talk to me,

15:01.242 --> 15:03.192
so I can help you schmooze?
No.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.336
I came to you
because you're also part owner.

15:06.571 --> 15:07.487
Fine.

15:07.572 --> 15:08.840
You and Jeff know each other.

15:08.925 --> 15:10.842
We're not exactly friends.
I know.

15:10.927 --> 15:12.367
But maybe you know him
well enough

15:12.452 --> 15:14.328
to tell me what deal
he would agree on.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.705
Jeff's the only one
with enough land to fit

15:16.790 --> 15:19.041
a football stadium
in the same area we agreed

15:19.126 --> 15:21.543
to place the team.
And he's also a silent partner.

15:21.628 --> 15:23.503
Jeff's program
has a way bigger impact

15:23.588 --> 15:24.880
on this community than our team.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.048
I can't do this to him.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.132
I thought
you guys weren't friends.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.675
This is not about me.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.220
This is about making
a difference in people's lives.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.389
Funny, I'd think you'd be
focused on your own life.

15:34.474 --> 15:35.357
What's that supposed to mean?

15:35.442 --> 15:36.892
If we don't have
a stadium deal,

15:36.977 --> 15:38.068
we don't have a team.

15:38.153 --> 15:39.561
And if we don't have a team,

15:39.646 --> 15:42.540
you're in charge
of player relations of nothing.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.209
Your stock options
become worthless.

15:45.294 --> 15:47.069
Of course,
you can always go back

15:47.154 --> 15:50.956
to being a driver
for someone like Blake.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.075
Or me. Or Jeff.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.035
You do have
more experience at that

15:55.120 --> 15:56.595
than at running a team.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.040
<i>Staff will have your belongings</i>

16:00.125 --> 16:01.508
up here in no time.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.085
Uh, I didn't bring any.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.254
I didn't expect
to be invited to stay.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.755
Oh, that's the
Carringtons for you.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.065
What they lack in tact,

16:08.150 --> 16:10.425
they make up for
in hospitality.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.594
We've had all sorts
of waifs and strays:

16:12.679 --> 16:13.529
crazy murderer,

16:13.614 --> 16:15.264
kidnapping nanny,

16:15.349 --> 16:16.500
faux gurus...

16:16.586 --> 16:17.358
Do you think that's me?

16:17.443 --> 16:18.817
I hope not.

16:18.902 --> 16:21.937
But I've learned the hard way
not to trust strangers.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.948
I'm hoping for a
positive result,

16:24.033 --> 16:28.277
so that we can erase
Hank from our lives.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.570
A moment with the
Lindbergh baby?

16:30.655 --> 16:32.572
Fallon, look,
I think we got off

16:32.657 --> 16:34.408
on the wrong foot.
Yes, you're right.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.577
Your feet never should've
stepped into our foyer.

16:37.662 --> 16:39.955
Now, how much will it take
for you to turn around

16:40.040 --> 16:42.599
and go back
to your Island of Misfit Boys?

16:43.686 --> 16:44.918
$5 million?

16:45.003 --> 16:46.295
I'm serious.
I am not gonna

16:46.380 --> 16:48.064
let you put my father
through this.

16:48.149 --> 16:49.673
I don't mean any harm
to your father.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.133
Ten?

16:51.218 --> 16:52.926
I can't believe
you're my little sister.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.378
Ha. That makes two of us.

16:54.463 --> 16:56.263
You know, all my life,
I thought I was an only child.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.616
And I always dreamed
about having a big family.

16:58.701 --> 17:01.101
I was never jealous of my
friends who grew up with money.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.511
Just the ones who had siblings.

17:02.596 --> 17:04.813
The way you're protecting
your dad, I-I wish I had

17:04.897 --> 17:08.291
someone like you protecting me
when I was growing up.

17:08.377 --> 17:10.002
I admire you, Fallon.

17:11.589 --> 17:13.155
$15 million?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.709
I have to get a DNA test.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.328
You can't tempt me
with money, Fallon.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.733
The only reason I came here
was to find out where I'm from.

17:21.945 --> 17:24.204
I'm not letting you put
a price tag on that.

17:29.119 --> 17:32.251
I-I know this isn't the-the
best father and son bonding time,

17:32.337 --> 17:34.542
but if Hank lied about
his sample, I want to be careful

17:34.628 --> 17:36.146
- about everything else.
- I get it.

17:36.231 --> 17:39.011
Being betrayed by the people
you love can screw you up.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.542
Got to say, seeing the name
Carrington all over the hospital

17:43.628 --> 17:45.321
is blowing my mind.

17:45.839 --> 17:46.797
Well, the Carrington name

17:46.883 --> 17:48.667
is on practically every
building in Atlanta.

17:48.753 --> 17:50.720
I know it's
overwhelming, but...

17:50.805 --> 17:52.838
you'll get used
to it pretty quick.

17:52.923 --> 17:54.724
I'm still getting used
to the people,

17:54.809 --> 17:56.842
let alone the name.

17:56.927 --> 17:59.159
And I-I don't know
anything about anyone.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.712
Well, let's see.

18:01.149 --> 18:03.349
Alexis's biggest asset

18:03.434 --> 18:05.979
is the last name that we let her
pretend that she still has.

18:06.065 --> 18:08.370
That and a trailer we
used to let her sleep in.

18:08.489 --> 18:10.698
Fallon's thing is
she almost married

18:10.784 --> 18:11.876
her cousin, but then she decided

18:11.961 --> 18:13.369
to marry a total
stranger instead.

18:13.455 --> 18:15.038
And then Anders, Anders is--

18:15.124 --> 18:16.558
He's like a second
father to me.

18:16.644 --> 18:18.469
And an actual father to Steven.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.422
He and Alexis had
an affair in the past.

18:20.508 --> 18:21.882
We just found out about it,

18:21.968 --> 18:24.511
and that's why
Steven's gone.

18:24.597 --> 18:26.764
God, I hope this isn't
making you want to run away.

18:26.850 --> 18:27.776
No, it doesn't.

18:27.862 --> 18:29.612
I'm not just doing this for you.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.291
I need these answers.

18:31.376 --> 18:33.201
I need to know
where I came from,

18:33.286 --> 18:35.078
who my father is.

18:35.163 --> 18:37.205
And, to be honest,
I need to know

18:37.290 --> 18:39.583
why you're so trusting of me
when no one else seems to be.

18:39.668 --> 18:41.084
Do you need a kidney or something?

18:41.169 --> 18:43.901
No, not yet.
But how's your liver?

18:43.987 --> 18:47.748
I just don't want to
lose a son to DNA again.

18:48.018 --> 18:50.093
Uh, I'm fine
getting my blood done,

18:50.178 --> 18:51.894
but seeing it done
on other people makes me feel

18:51.979 --> 18:53.299
kind of woozy.
Do you mind if I...

18:53.490 --> 18:55.390
step out and use the bathroom?

18:55.475 --> 18:57.601
No. If I faint, I'm
in the right place.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.408
There are
plenty of cases that show

19:11.494 --> 19:12.886
huge increases
in investment

19:13.010 --> 19:14.618
when a team adopts
a neighborhood.

19:14.703 --> 19:17.504
And we plan to hire 60% locally
during the construction period.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.955
And we'll pay you three times

19:19.040 --> 19:20.415
what you already paid
for the land.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.605
It's a win-win for everyone.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.620
It's a double win for you,
I'll give you that.

19:23.706 --> 19:25.667
The investments in the area
you're talking about,

19:25.753 --> 19:27.487
that's just a spin
on gentrification.

19:27.674 --> 19:30.759
And the jobs, they're good
in the short-term, yes,

19:30.844 --> 19:32.969
but they're gone
once construction is done.

19:33.054 --> 19:34.971
We'll make it our mission
to employ more locals

19:35.056 --> 19:36.615
once we get the
stadium off the ground.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.987
You name the percentage,
and we'll make it happen.

19:39.073 --> 19:41.144
Better yet,
you'll be in charge of that

19:41.229 --> 19:43.146
as the partner you already are.

19:43.231 --> 19:45.365
And what exactly would
that employment look like?

19:45.450 --> 19:47.651
The only thing to give
are concession gigs

19:47.736 --> 19:49.511
and jerseys
to go along with it.

19:49.597 --> 19:50.945
What's enriching
about that?

19:51.030 --> 19:52.131
I know
what you're doing,

19:52.216 --> 19:53.707
'cause I've been doing it
my whole life.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.104
You're trying to make a deal.

19:55.190 --> 19:56.491
But I'm trying
to change lives.

19:56.577 --> 19:59.787
So I want no part
of your great plan.

19:59.873 --> 20:02.714
Tell Blake that sending his wife
was a-a waste of time.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.892
I'm his partner.

20:03.978 --> 20:04.978
Right.

20:05.201 --> 20:07.886
Close the door on your way out,
partner.

20:07.972 --> 20:10.331
Thanks so much for taking
the time to do this.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.050
Consider it an apology
for earlier.

20:12.136 --> 20:14.302
That was no way to treat
a stranger who barged

20:14.387 --> 20:16.346
into my house claiming
to be a long-lost Carrington.

20:16.431 --> 20:19.158
Besides, now we get
to do our "getting

20:19.243 --> 20:22.161
to know my maybe-soon-to-be
brother" picnic,

20:22.246 --> 20:23.660
which we haven't done
since Hank, so...

20:23.745 --> 20:24.611
You said
your name was Mikey?

20:24.697 --> 20:27.147
Mike "Mikey" Harrison.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.834
Uh, I never really
liked it though.

20:28.919 --> 20:29.815
Too '80s for me.

20:29.901 --> 20:31.448
There's nothing wrong
with the '80s.

20:31.613 --> 20:32.684
You can ask my fanny packs.

20:32.769 --> 20:33.811
Plural?

20:33.897 --> 20:36.689
So, you don't like the '80s.
What else?

20:36.775 --> 20:38.051
What else do you want to know?
Favorite movie,

20:38.136 --> 20:39.677
- first love, and all that?
- Sure.

20:39.763 --> 20:40.846
The last place you worked.

20:40.932 --> 20:42.516
Three previous cities
you lived in.

20:42.602 --> 20:44.245
Last four digits of my social?

20:46.462 --> 20:47.887
Oh, you're serious.

20:47.973 --> 20:50.214
Well, I grew up in Billings.
Been there my whole life.

20:50.378 --> 20:53.216
Uh, I worked as a vet
at Happy Tails Clinic.

20:53.301 --> 20:54.425
Aw.

20:54.511 --> 20:56.262
Took care of my mom
while she was sick.

20:56.573 --> 20:57.792
No siblings.

20:57.878 --> 21:00.057
Though... now I
guess I have two.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.058
Though I haven't heard much
about Steven.

21:02.143 --> 21:03.860
Is he coming back
from Paraguay or--

21:03.945 --> 21:06.205
Would it be weird
if I went out there to meet him?

21:06.290 --> 21:07.873
Steven is a very private person.

21:07.958 --> 21:09.566
He doesn't want strangers
coming up to him,

21:09.651 --> 21:11.839
telling him that they're his brother.
Again.

21:11.925 --> 21:14.565
So what's his deal?
What's my maybe brother like?

21:14.651 --> 21:16.371
He's the best
brother you'll ever have.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.775
He's kind and generous.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.385
We don't need to answer any
of these questions

21:19.470 --> 21:21.488
until we can prove that you're
a member of this family.

21:21.573 --> 21:22.873
You barely made the train,
honey.

21:22.959 --> 21:24.941
It's gonna take a while
before you get a window seat.

21:25.026 --> 21:26.057
I'm sorry, honey.

21:26.143 --> 21:27.496
I just thought we were trying
to get to know each other.

21:27.581 --> 21:29.189
Well, this is how I get
to know people.

21:29.671 --> 21:31.471
And I think I've got
everything I need.

21:31.556 --> 21:32.753
If you wanted a résumé,

21:32.839 --> 21:34.233
you could've just done
a Google search on me.

21:34.318 --> 21:36.285
And you could've sent an
envelope with a mouth swab,

21:36.370 --> 21:37.786
but here we are.

21:37.872 --> 21:38.846
And I did search you,

21:38.932 --> 21:40.225
but you can't believe
everything you read,

21:40.310 --> 21:44.214
or hear, right?
Mikey Gordon Harrison.

21:44.323 --> 21:45.702
Come on, Sam.

21:57.305 --> 21:59.889
Really? It's not even 7:00 p.m.

22:00.201 --> 22:02.495
And I'm really looking
forward to going to bed.

22:02.752 --> 22:05.768
For the first time in
forever, I feel relaxed.

22:06.611 --> 22:09.807
People should replace sleeping
pills with long-lost sons.

22:09.893 --> 22:10.854
Right.

22:10.940 --> 22:13.358
About the stadium...
Yeah, about that.

22:13.444 --> 22:14.836
I'm-I'm really
thankful to you

22:14.922 --> 22:17.183
for taking the reins and letting
me spend time with Adam.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.111
I don't know what I would've
done if I had to handle

22:19.196 --> 22:20.779
that crisis on top
of everything.

22:24.017 --> 22:26.285
Yeah. It's all smooth sailing.

22:26.370 --> 22:28.645
Just sorting out some details.

22:28.730 --> 22:30.122
Well, I'm glad
you're on top of it.

22:36.551 --> 22:39.131
So you got what you needed
from Adam or Mikey

22:39.216 --> 22:41.300
or whatever his name is,
and we're done, right?

22:41.385 --> 22:43.135
Because I don't think
I can keep lying anymore.

22:43.220 --> 22:44.544
Oh, settle down,
Gaybraham Lincoln.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.012
Yes, we're done.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.382
Now it's time
for a little trip.

22:47.468 --> 22:49.185
Okay. There's a place
in Florida we can stay at

22:49.270 --> 22:50.495
until the dust settles.

22:50.581 --> 22:53.012
I told you, Sam,
I'm not setting foot in Florida

22:53.098 --> 22:54.660
until I die or run for office.

22:54.746 --> 22:55.888
This is more of
a learning trip.

22:55.973 --> 22:57.773
I'm gonna teach you
how to up your lying game.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.742
In Billings, Montana.

23:02.270 --> 23:03.603
It's okay, buddy.

23:03.688 --> 23:05.864
You're such a good boy.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.124
Oh, excuse me.

23:07.209 --> 23:08.775
Excuse me,
this is an emergency.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.869
Our dog needs to see
a vet immediately.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.320
We're married.
She's my husband.

23:12.405 --> 23:13.689
Your wife.
Wife.

23:13.774 --> 23:16.282
He's just nervous because,
you know, the dog is sick.

23:16.367 --> 23:17.826
This dog.
Yes. She gets it, honey.

23:17.911 --> 23:19.377
Right, darling.

23:19.462 --> 23:20.696
Anyway, we called earlier,

23:20.781 --> 23:21.996
but some secretary said
that you were all booked,

23:22.081 --> 23:24.666
which made us very sad,
because we were hoping

23:24.751 --> 23:26.885
that our doggy could see
the amazing Dr. Mikey.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.479
Mikey, uh, Harrison...
Mm-hmm.

23:28.564 --> 23:30.481
...I believe is his last name.
Mm-hmm.

23:30.566 --> 23:32.131
Anyway, please.
Reggie needs him.

23:32.216 --> 23:34.342
Well, what's wrong with Reggie?
I don't know.

23:34.427 --> 23:36.728
You know, I've never heard
that name for a female dog.

23:36.813 --> 23:39.731
Us, Reggie as in, uh, Regina.

23:39.816 --> 23:41.900
'Cause, you know, that's such
a cute name, right?

23:41.985 --> 23:44.402
And she's such a Reggie.
Oh.

23:44.487 --> 23:46.997
So can we, uh, see
Dr. Harrison, or what?

23:47.082 --> 23:48.740
I'm afraid
he doesn't work here anymore.

23:48.825 --> 23:50.859
What? Well,
that's unexpected.

23:50.944 --> 23:52.026
Where-where does he work?

23:52.111 --> 23:54.153
I mean, we really,
really want our dog

23:54.238 --> 23:55.864
to see the best vet
in Billings.

23:55.949 --> 23:58.583
Oh, really, Reggie is a perfect
name for her.

23:58.668 --> 24:00.235
Was he fired?

24:00.320 --> 24:01.870
- Nothing like that, I assure you.
- Well, then what was it?

24:01.955 --> 24:04.497
I mean, we should know
that information

24:04.582 --> 24:06.708
being the parents of
a prospective client.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.835
Oh, don't cry.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.837
Don't cry,
we'll find him.

24:10.922 --> 24:13.047
We will find Dr. Harrison.

24:13.132 --> 24:15.526
I don't blame you for wanting
to see him-- he was the best--

24:15.611 --> 24:17.778
But he went to Atlanta.
Everyone misses him.

24:17.863 --> 24:19.387
Even the pets.

24:19.472 --> 24:20.939
You know,
he loved animals so much,

24:21.024 --> 24:22.607
he left human medicine
to become a vet.

24:22.692 --> 24:25.393
Oh, he was a people doctor?

24:25.478 --> 24:28.229
Well, I think, uh, I think
Reggie's feeling all better.

24:28.314 --> 24:29.614
You want to live here? Yes.

24:29.699 --> 24:30.907
Let's go, Daddy.

24:30.992 --> 24:32.543
Got some more digging to do.

24:38.319 --> 24:40.121
I found another tract
of land that could work.

24:40.207 --> 24:42.034
- The state did reclaim it, though, so...
- Michael.

24:42.119 --> 24:43.369
That's not necessary.

24:43.493 --> 24:44.659
I've got it all worked out.

24:44.768 --> 24:46.235
Is that so?
It is.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.686
But I'm gonna need your help.

24:47.926 --> 24:49.726
I need you to go
to the zoning board vote.

24:49.811 --> 24:51.887
Bad idea. Jeff will be pissed
if he sees me there. Good.

24:51.972 --> 24:53.605
We're counting on that.

24:55.129 --> 24:57.332
Well, you have
been so helpful.

24:57.418 --> 24:59.528
And if there's anything the
Carrington Hospital Group

24:59.614 --> 25:00.929
can do for you,
do not hesitate.

25:01.014 --> 25:03.648
Okay. Thank you.

25:04.027 --> 25:05.661
Unbelievable.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.707
I'm thinking about buying land
in Montana.

25:07.793 --> 25:09.536
You know I'm all about
real estate, but at this point,

25:09.621 --> 25:10.710
it would be less
of an undertaking

25:10.795 --> 25:12.661
to adopt another dog
and name her Reggie.

25:12.746 --> 25:14.316
It's gross how well you know me.

25:14.402 --> 25:16.832
So when I called the hospital
in Billings and I told them

25:16.917 --> 25:18.959
that I would like to hire
Dr. Mikey Harrison

25:19.044 --> 25:20.831
for one of our hospitals here
in Atlanta,

25:20.917 --> 25:23.058
they told me
that he did not choose to leave.

25:23.144 --> 25:25.316
He was forced out
for patient abuse.

25:25.401 --> 25:27.393
Apparently,
he was prescribing opioids

25:27.478 --> 25:28.969
to his patients
without telling them,

25:29.054 --> 25:30.396
and then stealing
the drugs for himself.

25:30.481 --> 25:32.565
Well, that's cruel.
If this guy got fired

25:32.650 --> 25:35.309
and had his medical license
revoked for stealing drugs,

25:35.394 --> 25:37.161
doesn't it make sense that he
would go to a veterinary clinic

25:37.246 --> 25:38.687
where he could steal them
without the strict rules

25:38.772 --> 25:40.957
of a human hospital?
I hate to say it, but...

25:41.042 --> 25:43.242
You think I'm crazy?
I think you're not.

25:43.327 --> 25:44.693
It all checks out.

25:44.778 --> 25:47.029
This guy's life is falling apart
so he comes knocking

25:47.114 --> 25:49.248
on the golden Carrington door.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.843
Thank God I'm the gatekeeper.

25:51.928 --> 25:54.086
On the rezoning proposal
for entrepreneur Jeff Colby

25:54.171 --> 25:56.422
to build a music and arts center
on his vacant 70-acre lot

25:56.507 --> 25:58.901
in Adams Park,
how do you vote?

26:00.257 --> 26:01.698
Nay.

26:01.784 --> 26:02.928
What?

26:03.013 --> 26:04.880
- Nay.
- Nay.

26:04.965 --> 26:06.215
- Nay.
- Yea.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.424
Nay.

26:07.509 --> 26:08.550
Nay.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.977
The measure is defeated.

26:10.062 --> 26:12.721
Next up is a vote
on the proposed redevelopment

26:12.806 --> 26:14.515
of The Gulch
in downtown Atlanta.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.409
Hey, wait a second.
This is insane.

26:16.495 --> 26:18.185
The measure has been
defeated, Mr. Colby.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.676
Please clear the area so we
can get to other business.

26:19.761 --> 26:21.614
This was a slam dunk.

26:21.699 --> 26:24.233
A gift to the city,
to the community,

26:24.318 --> 26:26.068
that won't cost anyone a dime.

26:26.153 --> 26:27.246
How could you do this?

26:27.332 --> 26:29.121
There's not a damn thing wrong
with this proposal

26:29.206 --> 26:30.425
and you know it.

26:30.511 --> 26:33.074
You are all failing
the people of Atlanta,

26:33.160 --> 26:35.744
the people who need this project
the most, and-and for what?

26:35.829 --> 26:37.296
Someone tell me a single benefit

26:37.381 --> 26:38.798
of this project dying here
today.

26:38.883 --> 26:39.965
Mr. Colby.

26:42.794 --> 26:44.687
Unbelievable.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.492
Hi.

27:06.577 --> 27:08.735
What do you want?

27:08.820 --> 27:10.612
I'm... I'm just checking
you're okay.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.894
I'm not. No.

27:12.980 --> 27:14.545
I know you don't want me here.

27:14.826 --> 27:17.670
Which makes it
that much easier for me

27:17.755 --> 27:21.290
to disappear and go back
to my life.

27:21.375 --> 27:24.602
I really wish
that you hadn't come here.

27:24.687 --> 27:28.106
I had this crazy idea
that you would be the one

27:28.191 --> 27:30.799
who immediately knew
that I was really Adam.

27:30.884 --> 27:32.968
And I can't figure out why
you're so sure that I'm not.

27:33.053 --> 27:36.280
Listen, I have already
done this, Adam.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.932
Or whatever your name really is.

27:39.017 --> 27:40.785
Look at me closely.

27:40.870 --> 27:43.287
Please. I think you know
that I'm your son.

27:43.372 --> 27:45.814
But for some strange reason,
you...

27:45.899 --> 27:48.108
you're scared of me.

27:48.193 --> 27:49.535
Is it something I've done?

27:49.620 --> 27:51.921
I am so sorry
but you should go.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.217
I need you to go.

28:09.246 --> 28:11.824
Sorry to disturb you, sir,
but I thought you'd like to know

28:11.910 --> 28:14.256
the results of the DNA test
as soon as they came in.

28:14.342 --> 28:15.550
Of course.
What do they say?

28:15.635 --> 28:17.118
Well, at the risk
of sounding like

28:17.203 --> 28:20.096
a trashy talk show host,
you, Adam,

28:20.181 --> 28:22.456
are the son of Blake Carrington.

28:22.541 --> 28:24.125
It's a match.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.627
Yes. I knew it.

28:26.712 --> 28:28.012
Wonderful news.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.347
I'm so happy for both of you.

28:29.432 --> 28:30.422
Aw.

28:30.507 --> 28:31.799
Am I missing
a love fest?

28:31.884 --> 28:33.518
Be careful, Daddy, I know
that he won your heart,

28:33.603 --> 28:35.186
but he might have
just picked your pocket.

28:35.271 --> 28:36.687
Well, now, that's enough,
Fallon.

28:36.772 --> 28:39.598
'Cause the DNA results confirm
it, Adam is your brother.

28:39.683 --> 28:41.308
Well, you don't actually think
I give a damn about that.

28:41.393 --> 28:43.477
No. I've been there.
Done that.

28:43.562 --> 28:45.146
I am far more interested

28:45.231 --> 28:47.773
in how your doctor son
lost his license.

28:47.858 --> 28:50.276
By stealing narcotics
from his patients.

28:50.361 --> 28:51.410
Fallon, please.

28:51.495 --> 28:53.505
No, no, no, no, no.
It gets much worse.

28:53.590 --> 28:55.614
He then went to go work
at a veterinary clinic.

28:55.699 --> 28:57.533
To help animals? Oh, no.

28:57.618 --> 28:58.835
To steal more drugs.

28:58.920 --> 28:59.952
Because he is an addict.

29:00.037 --> 29:01.162
That-that can't be true.

29:01.247 --> 29:02.454
It is, Blake.
I know. It sucks.

29:02.539 --> 29:04.957
Look, it kills me
to come in here

29:05.042 --> 29:06.834
and crush your dreams,
but I'm not about to let

29:06.919 --> 29:10.171
this disgraced druggie come in
here and win you over in what,

29:10.256 --> 29:12.339
less than a day, only
to hurt you in the future.

29:12.424 --> 29:14.275
Is any of this true?

29:16.229 --> 29:18.512
It is. I was fired

29:18.597 --> 29:20.806
from a hospital and I went
to work at a vet's clinic.

29:20.891 --> 29:23.034
To get narcotics?
Yes.

29:23.119 --> 29:25.069
But not for me.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.162
For my mother.

29:26.247 --> 29:27.622
She was in pain
her whole life.

29:27.707 --> 29:29.574
I did anything
I could to help her.

29:29.659 --> 29:31.742
I mean, I became a doctor
because of her.

29:31.827 --> 29:33.411
Then she needed more,

29:33.496 --> 29:34.838
and I was,
I was a first-year resident.

29:34.923 --> 29:38.249
I didn't have any money,
so I... I prescribed drugs

29:38.334 --> 29:40.784
to my patients
without them knowing,

29:40.869 --> 29:43.605
and I went to the pharmacies
to pick them up myself.

29:43.777 --> 29:46.074
That's why I
lost my license.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.260
And then when she overdosed...

29:49.345 --> 29:52.168
Look, I feel responsible
for her death.

29:52.254 --> 29:53.816
I enabled her addiction.

29:53.902 --> 29:55.716
I just wanted
to stop her pain.

29:55.801 --> 29:58.386
I'm really sorry
I didn't tell you.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.803
Or you, Fallon.

30:01.729 --> 30:03.371
I'm sorry, son.

30:03.785 --> 30:06.185
What you've gone through
is unimaginable.

30:06.270 --> 30:07.394
And partially my fault.

30:07.479 --> 30:08.779
N-None of it's your fault.

30:08.864 --> 30:12.024
I do understand what it's like
to live with an addict.

30:12.109 --> 30:14.952
Steven has been struggling
for most of his life.

30:15.037 --> 30:17.199
It may be helpful
if you tell your story

30:17.285 --> 30:18.197
to him when you meet him
next week.

30:18.282 --> 30:20.241
I'm sorry. What?
You're gonna meet Steven?

30:20.326 --> 30:22.960
Yeah. We thought
it would be nice, uh,

30:23.045 --> 30:25.388
to connect with Steven, but now
I think it would be imperative.

30:25.473 --> 30:26.473
In Paraguay?

30:26.715 --> 30:28.016
I've made the arrangements

30:28.101 --> 30:29.583
for the jet
and the accommodation,

30:29.668 --> 30:30.894
and no tents this time.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.378
I think it's
a terrible idea,

30:32.464 --> 30:35.066
and you should
absolutely not go.

30:35.152 --> 30:37.132
Sam, I know that you
and Steven are having

30:37.217 --> 30:38.592
a hard time right now,
but you wouldn't try

30:38.677 --> 30:39.903
to stop his father
and his brother

30:39.988 --> 30:41.237
from spending time
with him, would you?

30:41.322 --> 30:42.480
I can think of
a million reasons

30:42.565 --> 30:43.722
why you shouldn't go
to Paraguay.

30:43.807 --> 30:44.949
- Such as...?
- Such as:

30:45.034 --> 30:46.910
this is hurricane season,
for one.

30:46.995 --> 30:48.203
Anders?

30:48.288 --> 30:50.938
Well, Paraguay
is landlocked, sir.

30:51.023 --> 30:52.106
You're clear.

30:52.191 --> 30:53.241
No, not clear.

30:53.326 --> 30:55.901
They-they still
have heavy rain

30:55.986 --> 30:57.308
and strong winds.

30:57.394 --> 30:59.713
It's not ideal
for traveling.

30:59.799 --> 31:01.916
It's not safe.

31:02.001 --> 31:04.335
You know what? Um, Adam.

31:04.420 --> 31:05.785
I have been rude to you.

31:05.871 --> 31:08.004
I have been disgustingly
rude to you,

31:08.090 --> 31:10.007
and I would like to
spend the next few weeks

31:10.092 --> 31:11.768
making it up to
my new brother.

31:11.853 --> 31:12.969
You have a lifetime to do that.

31:13.054 --> 31:14.795
We're going to Paraguay.
End of discussion.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.930
You can't go to Paraguay.

31:16.015 --> 31:17.715
You can't go.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.135
Because Steven is not
in Paraguay,

31:21.220 --> 31:23.354
Steven is in Paris.

31:23.439 --> 31:25.931
And that's where we were.
Seriously?

31:26.016 --> 31:27.433
What?

31:27.518 --> 31:29.510
With everything that Cristal
and I have been going through?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.854
The three of you flitted off to
Paris for some shopping spree?

31:31.939 --> 31:33.456
That's low, Fallon,
even for you.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.774
We didn't go
on a shopping spree, Dad.

31:35.859 --> 31:37.943
I went to...

31:38.028 --> 31:41.372
<i>We</i> went to Paris to go...

31:41.457 --> 31:43.657
to go find Steven.

31:43.742 --> 31:44.825
Did you? Where is he?

31:44.910 --> 31:46.452
He's in a mental hospital.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.495
And he didn't want
me to tell you that.

31:48.580 --> 31:50.264
But there it is.

31:51.417 --> 31:53.267
Welcome to the funhouse.

31:58.871 --> 32:01.543
At the very least, you should
have told me immediately, and

32:01.629 --> 32:03.333
the only reason why you did come
clean is because you got caught.

32:03.418 --> 32:05.043
Well, this is not how
I wanted this to come out.

32:05.128 --> 32:06.586
I don't know.
You just had so much tragedy

32:06.671 --> 32:09.381
going on in your life lately,
with Mark and with the baby.

32:09.466 --> 32:10.516
Oh, stop acting like
you were trying

32:10.601 --> 32:12.084
to protect me,
'cause you weren't.

32:12.169 --> 32:13.677
You were just trying to avoid
your own feelings of guilt.

32:13.762 --> 32:15.011
Because you
failed Steven.

32:15.096 --> 32:16.238
And you certainly failed me.

32:16.323 --> 32:17.757
She did the right thing.

32:17.842 --> 32:20.567
She was just dealing with
her own pain as best she could.

32:20.652 --> 32:22.111
That's why
she didn't tell you.

32:22.196 --> 32:24.396
Believe me, I've dealt with the
same things in my family, and

32:24.481 --> 32:27.232
I've made difficult decisions,
and you wanted to spare

32:27.317 --> 32:29.543
your family the pain
that you've had to endure alone.

32:29.628 --> 32:31.879
Right?

32:31.964 --> 32:33.905
Dad, you just got me back.

32:33.990 --> 32:35.532
You don't want
to lose another one.

32:36.194 --> 32:38.795
Just need time
to process all this.

32:40.630 --> 32:43.269
And I think Adam should be
the one to help you with that.

32:45.019 --> 32:46.686
I think you should stay.

32:47.769 --> 32:49.168
What?

32:49.254 --> 32:52.550
I promised my dad
that I would do my best

32:52.636 --> 32:54.217
to protect him,
but look what happened.

32:54.302 --> 32:58.496
So, I think he needs you right
now more than he needs me.

33:00.039 --> 33:01.598
Will you stay?

33:02.547 --> 33:04.441
I'd be honored to.

33:09.782 --> 33:11.649
Do you need a map to your room?

33:11.972 --> 33:13.445
No.

33:13.530 --> 33:15.410
I just wanted to apologize.

33:15.644 --> 33:17.258
If I had known
what the real deal was...

33:17.343 --> 33:19.117
You would have done
the same thing.

33:19.202 --> 33:20.824
And you'd have been right.

33:20.996 --> 33:22.913
I'm just happy
everything's out in the open.

33:23.097 --> 33:24.558
It was really killing Sam.

33:24.644 --> 33:25.791
Yeah, it was
killing you, too.

33:25.876 --> 33:27.584
- I saw it.
- I'm stronger than I look.

33:27.669 --> 33:29.344
I don't think you are.

33:29.429 --> 33:31.761
I mean, sure, you...
you look like this badass

33:31.847 --> 33:33.107
that doesn't take crap
from anyone,

33:33.192 --> 33:35.184
but you care about
your brother,

33:35.269 --> 33:37.928
and you're allowed to feel
the pain over his choice

33:38.013 --> 33:39.863
and your choice to
go along with it.

33:46.757 --> 33:48.775
Hmm?

33:50.042 --> 33:52.317
I hope we're the kind of family
that kisses on the lips.

33:52.402 --> 33:54.253
We're so not.
Oh.

33:55.974 --> 33:57.427
Maybe we are now.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.021
You know, it's really
easy to see why you're

33:59.106 --> 34:00.864
the heart of this family.

34:01.109 --> 34:03.302
The smartest, the most driven.

34:03.865 --> 34:05.341
The one who can
think ahead.

34:05.427 --> 34:06.790
We're very alike,
you and me.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.759
We really are siblings.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.310
Two of a kind.

34:12.755 --> 34:14.898
Sweet dreams, sis.

34:16.802 --> 34:19.803
Remember last year when I
voted to sell your company?

34:19.888 --> 34:21.489
Those were the
good ole days.

34:21.574 --> 34:23.491
What are you doing here, Jeff?
It's really not a good time.

34:23.576 --> 34:24.884
Then let's
make it better.

34:24.969 --> 34:28.520
How about we celebrate
both of our losses? Here.

34:28.605 --> 34:30.224
You may have screwed
me over again,

34:30.364 --> 34:31.936
but that doesn't mean
I'm letting you win.

34:32.021 --> 34:35.774
And if you thought that
I would let you buy my land

34:35.946 --> 34:37.821
to build your stadium,

34:37.906 --> 34:40.031
then you've really
lost your Madoff touch.

34:40.116 --> 34:42.583
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

34:42.668 --> 34:45.587
I tried to buy his land
for our stadium.

34:45.672 --> 34:47.998
I offered him plenty
of money, but...

34:48.083 --> 34:49.591
But I told your second
Cristal in command,

34:49.676 --> 34:50.876
that it was never about that.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.688
So I sold the land
to DiFiore Exports

34:54.773 --> 34:56.690
for half of what you offered.

34:56.775 --> 34:58.192
They're an Italian-based company

34:58.277 --> 34:59.885
with zero interest
in getting involved

34:59.970 --> 35:01.344
with the Carrington clan.

35:01.429 --> 35:03.221
I guess that dooms
the Atlantix.

35:03.306 --> 35:04.598
Oh, well, that is
one partnership

35:04.683 --> 35:06.567
that I'm not sad to see fail.

35:06.755 --> 35:10.538
That's the look
I came to see.

35:10.623 --> 35:13.248
Been a pleasure <i> not</i> doing
business with you, Blake.

35:17.591 --> 35:18.724
Did...? What...?

35:18.810 --> 35:21.138
Oh, what was I thinking
letting you handle this?

35:21.224 --> 35:22.457
You should have
come to me, Cristal.

35:22.542 --> 35:23.909
Nobody knows Jeff
like I do.

35:23.994 --> 35:25.294
I would have thought
of something.

35:25.379 --> 35:27.245
Oh, now we're screwed.

35:27.330 --> 35:29.080
<i>Ay, no, mi amor.</i>

35:29.165 --> 35:31.692
We're not screwed.
We're celebrating.

35:31.778 --> 35:33.227
Adam coming back

35:33.312 --> 35:36.063
and you building the Atlantix
stadium on Jeff's land.

35:36.148 --> 35:37.756
Did you not hear what he said?!

35:37.841 --> 35:39.424
He sold the land
to another company!

35:39.509 --> 35:41.927
He thinks he did.
Thanks to you.

35:42.012 --> 35:43.720
And, Michael,
don't worry.

35:43.805 --> 35:45.903
Everything you pitched
Jeff about our plans

35:45.989 --> 35:47.265
for the community
will happen.

35:47.350 --> 35:49.601
We'll make sure this
is a good project, too.

35:49.686 --> 35:51.579
Whatever helps us
sleep at night, right?

35:51.664 --> 35:53.488
Exactly.

35:53.573 --> 35:55.440
Would someone please
tell me what's going on?!

35:55.525 --> 35:56.816
Michael will fill you in.

35:56.901 --> 35:59.569
Uh, there's one more
thing I need to deal with.

35:59.654 --> 36:01.571
But I stand for what I said.

36:01.922 --> 36:03.773
We should trust family.

36:51.081 --> 36:52.264
Beto.

37:26.224 --> 37:27.302
Tea?

37:31.861 --> 37:33.836
I'm sure
you heard the news.

37:36.718 --> 37:39.928
I just... came
to say good night.

37:41.131 --> 37:43.048
And I hope that someday,

37:43.133 --> 37:45.717
you'll be able to accept me...

37:46.050 --> 37:47.442
Mother.

37:47.528 --> 37:50.489
<i>♪ I've been waiting... ♪</i>

37:51.794 --> 37:55.335
Oh, there is just one thing
I wanted to get off my chest.

37:55.436 --> 37:58.038
After my other mother died,

37:58.123 --> 38:02.028
I really wanted to meet my
brother, so I went to Paraguay.

38:02.114 --> 38:05.653
What? You...
met Steven?

38:05.739 --> 38:06.520
I did.

38:06.606 --> 38:08.192
Such a kind soul.

38:08.763 --> 38:11.201
In one of our conversations,
he told me the story

38:11.286 --> 38:13.411
about how he found Hank,

38:13.496 --> 38:16.247
and how you sent him
to El Paso where

38:16.332 --> 38:19.727
Adam had last been seen,
which I found odd,

38:19.812 --> 38:21.920
because I've never
been to Texas.

38:22.005 --> 38:24.255
Well, that's because

38:24.340 --> 38:27.150
the investigator that
I hired said so.

38:28.511 --> 38:30.261
He, um... well,
he fooled me.

38:30.346 --> 38:31.405
So you're just

38:31.490 --> 38:33.431
burning those files for fun,

38:33.516 --> 38:35.433
not covering
your tracks, right?

38:35.518 --> 38:38.103
Well, they're just
old tax returns.

38:38.188 --> 38:40.447
I hate clutter.
'Cause the thing is,

38:41.099 --> 38:44.643
Steven also told me that he saw
Hank's positive DNA results,

38:44.729 --> 38:46.611
which couldn't have been real.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.072
So when I was at the clinic

38:49.157 --> 38:52.244
doing my DNA testing,
I did some digging.

38:54.471 --> 38:56.830
Do you know what this is? Of
course I don't. Why would I?

38:56.915 --> 39:00.244
Not only were Hank's results
not a match,

39:00.330 --> 39:02.980
but they were signed for
by someone in the family.

39:03.188 --> 39:06.064
Someone who clearly
switched them.

39:07.194 --> 39:09.135
Someone who is you.

39:09.385 --> 39:10.593
Mother.

39:10.678 --> 39:12.470
And I take it

39:12.555 --> 39:14.931
that's why you were so
against me in the first place.

39:15.016 --> 39:16.141
Your real son.

39:16.226 --> 39:17.308
To protect your lie?

39:17.393 --> 39:19.310
No, I had no choice.

39:19.395 --> 39:21.938
I was an outsider.
I had nothing.

39:22.023 --> 39:24.315
As despicable as it sounds,

39:24.400 --> 39:27.002
I had to do something
to get my family back.

39:27.764 --> 39:31.424
I am so... sorry, Adam.

39:31.908 --> 39:33.992
Please tell me that
you understand.

39:34.077 --> 39:35.827
I-I do understand.

39:35.912 --> 39:38.224
I-I want my family back, too.

39:38.778 --> 39:40.200
But right now, I...

39:40.286 --> 39:42.370
I just want a hug
from my real mother.

40:32.786 --> 40:35.529
You had so many chances

40:35.614 --> 40:37.889
And you hurt Blake so badly,

40:37.974 --> 40:40.033
and you were willing
to do it again.
