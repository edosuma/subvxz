WEBVTT

00:00.253 --> 00:01.986
The concept feels cohesive.

00:02.021 --> 00:04.188
Looks like a psychedelic
artichoke with a bat face.

00:04.223 --> 00:08.426
This is my favorite makeup
I've seen on <i>Face Off.</i>

00:08.460 --> 00:10.028
Previously on <i>Face Off,</i>

00:10.062 --> 00:12.864
Ben and Darla's cactus ram
brought Ben his first win.

00:12.898 --> 00:13.865
Nice.

00:13.899 --> 00:15.099
But Alan fell short

00:15.134 --> 00:18.169
and was the first
on Team Anthony to be sent home.

00:20.039 --> 00:22.140
Now 13 artists remain,

00:22.174 --> 00:25.677
and tonight they'll be dealt
their toughest challenge yet.

00:25.711 --> 00:27.945
Having a panic attack right now.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.081
Now I know why people freak out
on <i> Face Off.</i>

00:30.115 --> 00:31.382
It's time, everybody.

00:31.417 --> 00:32.884
Ah, shit.

00:32.918 --> 00:35.186
Might be putting a makeup
onstage that's not finished.

00:35.220 --> 00:36.487
It's really hard not to love it.

00:36.522 --> 00:37.555
Thank you.

00:37.589 --> 00:39.057
In the end, only one will win

00:39.091 --> 00:41.292
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-up

00:41.327 --> 00:44.195
to one of their
85 international locations,

00:44.229 --> 00:46.998
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:47.032 --> 00:50.802
and $100,000.

00:50.836 --> 00:52.937
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

Wow, look at the chandeliers.

01:32.945 --> 01:34.445
[Indistinct chatter]

01:34.480 --> 01:37.348
We're walking through
this really cool casino.

01:38.384 --> 01:39.384
People are gambling.

01:39.418 --> 01:40.785
It's just
a beautiful atmosphere.

01:40.819 --> 01:42.553
- Look at this.
- Nice.

01:42.588 --> 01:44.288
We're like, "What's the deal?"

01:44.323 --> 01:47.091
I have, like, a million things
going through my flipping head.

01:49.928 --> 01:50.895
Hey, guys.

01:50.929 --> 01:51.963
All: Hey.

01:51.997 --> 01:53.931
Welcome to The Normandie Casino.

01:53.966 --> 01:56.167
This is a popular location
for filmmakers

01:56.201 --> 01:59.103
in need
of that classic Las Vegas look,

01:59.138 --> 02:00.605
but it's right here
in Hollywood.

02:00.639 --> 02:02.640
It's been featured in movies
and television shows

02:02.674 --> 02:04.909
like <i> The X-Files, Big Love,</i>

02:04.943 --> 02:07.111
and <i> Buffy The Vampire Slayer.</i>

02:07.146 --> 02:08.846
And whether you're playing
Texas hold'em

02:08.881 --> 02:10.080
with your poker buddies

02:10.115 --> 02:12.583
or screaming "Blackjack"
on a casino floor,

02:12.618 --> 02:15.520
this week's challenge involves
some classic characters

02:15.554 --> 02:17.922
you're probably
very familiar with.

02:17.956 --> 02:21.159
They make up the royal court
of the gaming world.

02:21.193 --> 02:22.226
Nice.

02:22.261 --> 02:23.861
King...

02:23.896 --> 02:25.463
- Oh, my goodness.
- Queen,

02:25.497 --> 02:28.132
jack, and joker.

02:28.167 --> 02:30.168
Nice.

02:30.202 --> 02:33.237
Now, in Tim Burton's
<i>Alice In wonderland,</i>

02:33.272 --> 02:36.207
Helena Bonham Carter's
highly exaggerated version

02:36.241 --> 02:38.976
of the red queen of hearts
played a pivotal role

02:39.011 --> 02:40.311
in establishing the film's

02:40.345 --> 02:43.681
outlandishly stylized setting
and tone.

02:43.715 --> 02:45.082
So with that in mind,

02:45.117 --> 02:48.152
- your first individual...
- Yes!

02:48.187 --> 02:50.755
Spotlight challenge

02:50.789 --> 02:52.356
is to choose a card

02:52.391 --> 02:54.425
and bring that character to life

02:54.460 --> 02:56.794
in an outlandish and quirky way

02:56.829 --> 02:58.629
worthy of a Tim Burton film.

02:58.664 --> 02:59.630
Oh, my God.

02:59.665 --> 03:01.132
And you must also somehow

03:01.166 --> 03:04.635
incorporate your card's suit
into your makeup...

03:04.670 --> 03:08.139
diamond, club, heart, or spade.

03:08.173 --> 03:10.708
If you get the joker,
you can choose any suit you want

03:10.742 --> 03:12.143
to incorporate into your makeup.

03:12.177 --> 03:14.145
I'm thrilled that
it's an individual challenge,

03:14.179 --> 03:15.980
'cause I get to show
what I have to offer.

03:16.014 --> 03:18.049
This is awesome.

03:18.083 --> 03:21.118
Jamie, you're first pick.

03:21.153 --> 03:22.220
King of spades.

03:22.254 --> 03:24.055
- King of clubs.
- Jack of spades.

03:24.089 --> 03:25.089
Queen of hearts.

03:25.123 --> 03:26.390
Queen of diamonds.

03:26.425 --> 03:27.558
King of diamonds.

03:27.593 --> 03:28.860
Jack of hearts.

03:28.894 --> 03:30.394
- Joker.
- King of hearts.

03:30.429 --> 03:32.163
- Jack of diamonds.
- Queen of clubs.

03:32.197 --> 03:33.331
Queen of spades.

03:33.365 --> 03:35.099
Jack of clubs.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.335
All right, it's time
to get started on your sketches.

03:37.369 --> 03:38.903
Good luck.

03:38.937 --> 03:40.171
- Thank you.
- Bye.

03:45.444 --> 03:48.346
The jack of diamonds
is the virtue of patience,

03:48.380 --> 03:52.149
so I'm thinking of a character
that has been waiting so long,

03:52.184 --> 03:54.519
he's just completely old
and decrepit.

03:54.553 --> 03:56.621
So it's a whimsical character

03:56.655 --> 03:58.589
yet scary at the same time.

04:00.993 --> 04:03.628
My king of diamonds
is a greedy, lonely king.

04:03.662 --> 04:06.631
One diamond that a witch
gave him is making him sick.

04:06.665 --> 04:09.200
And to push the diamond factor,

04:09.234 --> 04:11.669
I'm gonna give him
a diamond-shaped face.

04:13.839 --> 04:16.307
I'm excited to have hearts
as my suit.

04:16.341 --> 04:18.108
The jack of hearts,
specifically,

04:18.142 --> 04:19.709
represents jealousy.

04:19.745 --> 04:22.613
So he is the advisor
to the king of hearts,

04:22.648 --> 04:24.415
but he is secretly in love
with the queen,

04:24.449 --> 04:26.217
and so he is very jealous
of the king.

04:26.251 --> 04:29.453
I'm gonna build his face
into a heart shape

04:29.488 --> 04:31.923
by sculpting the beard and hair.

04:31.957 --> 04:33.758
I think it's really gonna
capture the essence

04:33.792 --> 04:35.293
of this challenge.

04:37.329 --> 04:38.796
I get the king of clubs,

04:38.830 --> 04:41.332
and the first things
that enter my mind

04:41.366 --> 04:43.100
are jokes and plays on words.

04:43.135 --> 04:45.002
So I'm doing a king
of nightclubs

04:45.037 --> 04:47.838
who's this slick,
rat pack entertainer.

04:47.873 --> 04:50.374
And if a party needs
to be thrown, he's throwing it.

04:52.878 --> 04:55.713
My queen of spades
is this judge-like character.

04:55.747 --> 04:57.348
When you walk
into her courtroom,

04:57.382 --> 04:59.250
it's her decision whether you...
[Clicks tongue]

04:59.284 --> 05:00.484
Or you're let free.

05:00.519 --> 05:03.421
The hair will be sculpted
into the headpiece,

05:03.455 --> 05:05.556
and it'll read like a spade.

05:09.194 --> 05:11.062
I'm in trouble.

05:29.381 --> 05:32.350
All right, everybody,
let's go back to the house.

05:41.627 --> 05:42.693
It's day one in the lab.

05:42.728 --> 05:44.028
I have 5 1/2 hours.

05:44.062 --> 05:45.463
I chose king of spades,

05:45.497 --> 05:46.964
which is traditionally seen

05:46.999 --> 05:50.001
as David in David and Goliath.

05:50.035 --> 05:52.536
So I want to pick
a big, burly male model

05:52.571 --> 05:56.173
and then style the wig
into the shape of a spade.

05:56.208 --> 05:59.010
Finally, it dwindles down
to one male model

05:59.044 --> 06:01.545
and one female model,

06:01.580 --> 06:03.581
and the male model gets chosen.

06:03.615 --> 06:05.983
Now my whole concept
has to change.

06:06.018 --> 06:07.752
And it's time
to start sculpting,

06:07.786 --> 06:09.620
but I have no idea what to do.

06:09.655 --> 06:11.889
So I start sketching it out
in clay

06:11.923 --> 06:14.325
to see what I can come up with.

06:15.494 --> 06:16.460
Hey!

06:16.495 --> 06:17.461
Hey, Laura.

06:17.496 --> 06:18.462
- Hey, guys.
- How you doing?

06:18.497 --> 06:19.530
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

06:19.564 --> 06:21.298
So what are you doing?

06:21.333 --> 06:22.533
I have the king of spades,

06:22.567 --> 06:24.301
but I have a female model.

06:24.336 --> 06:25.936
Oh.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.873
Gender change is automatically
gonna be a challenge,

06:28.907 --> 06:30.374
especially with proportions.

06:30.409 --> 06:31.842
- I'd say keep it fun.
- Yeah.

06:31.877 --> 06:32.843
I wouldn't make it too...

06:32.878 --> 06:34.311
- Serious?
- Serious.

06:34.346 --> 06:36.781
And I think you should make it
more of a whimsical character

06:36.815 --> 06:38.115
so that the judges don't see it

06:38.150 --> 06:39.617
as a woman underneath, you know?

06:39.651 --> 06:40.951
- A woman underneath a man.
- Yeah.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.753
For my new concept,
my king of spades

06:42.788 --> 06:46.290
is a very prideful, short man
who holds a big sword

06:46.324 --> 06:49.260
but looks completely ridiculous.

06:49.294 --> 06:50.461
Okay. We'll do this.

06:50.495 --> 06:52.797
Okay.

06:52.831 --> 06:53.798
So what you got?

06:53.832 --> 06:55.599
Got the jack of clubs.

06:55.634 --> 06:58.302
The jack of clubs
represents wisdom,

06:58.336 --> 07:01.205
so I immediately think
of this older advisor

07:01.239 --> 07:02.473
to the king of the underworld,

07:02.507 --> 07:04.675
and he helps lead people
to the underworld.

07:04.710 --> 07:05.710
I like the cheekbone.

07:05.744 --> 07:07.078
I like how gaunt it is.

07:07.112 --> 07:09.980
I'm sculpting the club form
directly on the forehead

07:10.015 --> 07:12.283
using the cheekbones
as the side of the clubs.

07:12.317 --> 07:14.885
I like the idea that he was
branded with the club symbol.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.421
I really see
a lot of potential in Julian.

07:17.456 --> 07:18.956
It's an incredible asset

07:18.990 --> 07:21.592
to be able to think
outside the box.

07:26.698 --> 07:28.899
So I got the king of hearts.

07:28.934 --> 07:31.635
The king is stabbing himself
in the head with a knife.

07:31.670 --> 07:32.903
Right, suicide king.

07:32.938 --> 07:35.005
This is my favorite card
in the entire deck.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.007
I decide that
the king is depressed

07:37.042 --> 07:39.777
because the queen of hearts
was killed in front of him.

07:39.811 --> 07:42.012
And I chose a female model

07:42.047 --> 07:43.848
because I want this king
to look long,

07:43.882 --> 07:44.982
kind of drawn out, thin.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.383
I like
where you're going with it.

07:46.418 --> 07:47.952
Okay, cool.

07:49.955 --> 07:51.522
Oh, this is kind of fun.
Queen of hearts.

07:51.556 --> 07:54.125
Yes, I don't want to go
too <i>Alice In Wonderland</i> with it.

07:54.159 --> 07:55.159
Absolutely, yeah, I...

07:55.193 --> 07:56.160
I'm a little nervous,

07:56.194 --> 07:57.428
because it can't look

07:57.462 --> 07:59.530
like all the queen of hearts
that have been done.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.532
But I do want
to take the evil route.

08:01.566 --> 08:02.767
It could be any kind of heart.

08:02.801 --> 08:04.635
So even, like,
the human heart is okay?

08:04.669 --> 08:06.170
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Okay, all right.

08:06.204 --> 08:09.874
So I decide that she keeps
all the hearts of her victims

08:09.908 --> 08:11.776
on a picket fence
around her neck,

08:11.810 --> 08:14.979
and she has a huge,
asymmetrical, red wig.

08:15.013 --> 08:16.213
I kind of do love this.

08:16.248 --> 08:17.381
Thank you.

08:19.718 --> 08:20.951
Shit.

08:20.986 --> 08:23.287
I'm not liking
what I'm doing right now.

08:23.321 --> 08:25.923
My sculpt looks like a man,
not a queen,

08:25.957 --> 08:27.191
and now I'm worried.

08:27.225 --> 08:28.559
Doing it.

08:28.593 --> 08:31.128
This is a confused piece.

08:31.163 --> 08:32.395
He's got such a strong brow,

08:32.429 --> 08:35.765
a strong nose, a strong chin...
too monster.

08:35.801 --> 08:38.568
Daniel's concept is very scary,
very serious...

08:38.602 --> 08:41.038
not really the point
of this challenge.

08:41.072 --> 08:43.774
I think you should start again.

08:43.808 --> 08:45.142
I don't believe it.

08:45.177 --> 08:47.578
Anthony wants me
to start from scratch,

08:47.612 --> 08:49.747
and I have no time.

08:49.781 --> 08:51.482
People are already finishing,

08:51.516 --> 08:54.251
but I know if I don't do this,
I'm gonna be in trouble,

08:54.286 --> 08:55.586
definitely.

08:57.389 --> 08:58.355
Do it?

08:58.390 --> 09:00.124
Okay, let's go.

09:07.228 --> 09:09.863
It's the first day
of our playing card challenge,

09:09.898 --> 09:13.667
and I decide to destroy
my sculpture and start again.

09:13.701 --> 09:15.402
I got to think
a little bit more,

09:15.437 --> 09:17.037
because I need an idea,

09:17.072 --> 09:20.974
not just, like, a bunch of clay
with nose and ears.

09:21.009 --> 09:23.677
Here we go again.

09:23.711 --> 09:24.745
Hi, everybody.

09:24.779 --> 09:26.080
- Hi.
- Hey, how's it going?

09:26.114 --> 09:29.116
It's time to show me
what you've been dealt.

09:29.150 --> 09:32.319
I picked the jack of spades,
the one-eyed jack.

09:32.353 --> 09:34.388
So he's gonna be
a musketeer-style character,

09:34.422 --> 09:36.323
and then I'm gonna incorporate
the actual spade

09:36.357 --> 09:38.826
as a patch on his eye that's
actually sewn into his face.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.094
It's more horror...

09:40.128 --> 09:41.495
Okay, I see what you're saying.

09:41.529 --> 09:42.496
Than it is whimsical
and Tim Burton.

09:42.530 --> 09:43.997
- Yeah.
- Be careful with that...

09:44.032 --> 09:45.766
- Okay.
- so it doesn't look gory.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.301
I have the joker.

09:47.335 --> 09:49.837
I'm thinking of him
more as a toy.

09:49.871 --> 09:52.106
I want to do a face in the front

09:52.140 --> 09:54.942
and a face in the back
with a different expression.

09:54.976 --> 09:57.411
You still have reality
going on there,

09:57.445 --> 09:59.546
so I would take it
and go for the full fantasy.

09:59.581 --> 10:00.547
Okay.

10:00.582 --> 10:02.082
You are in clay hell.

10:02.117 --> 10:03.283
Yeah.

10:03.318 --> 10:05.018
Finally I came up
with a new design

10:05.053 --> 10:06.320
for my queen of diamonds.

10:06.354 --> 10:09.189
She's so vain,
and she collects diamonds,

10:09.224 --> 10:10.390
and she eats them,

10:10.425 --> 10:13.660
so her lips and face
will be a diamond shape.

10:13.695 --> 10:16.163
Elongate the face
to create the whole diamond.

10:16.197 --> 10:17.431
- Like this.
- Good, good.

10:17.465 --> 10:18.632
Thank you very much.

10:18.666 --> 10:21.735
My character
is the queen of clubs.

10:21.769 --> 10:25.572
My concept is this aged,
heavier-set queen,

10:25.607 --> 10:27.674
and I want to incorporate
the shape of the club

10:27.709 --> 10:30.277
in some natural wrinkle lines
that complement her face.

10:30.311 --> 10:32.513
I think your whole concept
of your symbol

10:32.547 --> 10:33.814
is going to get lost.

10:33.848 --> 10:35.849
These things have to have
more definition.

10:35.884 --> 10:36.950
You got to be able to see it.

10:36.985 --> 10:37.985
Okay.

10:38.019 --> 10:39.019
Bye-bye.

10:39.053 --> 10:40.587
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

10:44.225 --> 10:45.425
I think this is ready.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.327
I really want to get
this face knocked out

10:47.362 --> 10:48.595
for my jack of diamonds.

10:48.630 --> 10:49.663
Yeah, that's better, man.

10:49.697 --> 10:51.131
The mouth is looking really cool

10:51.166 --> 10:53.367
'cause it's sunk in
like he's got no teeth,

10:53.401 --> 10:54.668
real old-looking.

10:54.702 --> 10:56.737
And now I'm ready
to start molding this thing.

10:59.474 --> 11:00.874
Just a little frustrated.

11:00.909 --> 11:03.577
Something's feeling weird
about this character right now.

11:03.611 --> 11:06.413
I think that the old age
is hindering you.

11:06.447 --> 11:08.582
The wrinkle patterns
are blending in

11:08.616 --> 11:10.284
with the cheekbones too much,

11:10.318 --> 11:12.853
so the club forms need to be
a little more obvious.

11:12.887 --> 11:14.488
First idea is not
always the best.

11:14.522 --> 11:15.889
This is a pretty big change.

11:15.924 --> 11:19.826
I start scraping the old-age
sculpture off of the face,

11:19.861 --> 11:23.397
so now I'm making my design
thinner and younger,

11:23.431 --> 11:26.600
and I think that will help
show the shape of the club.

11:26.634 --> 11:28.435
Time is of the essence.

11:30.939 --> 11:31.972
I got to get out of here.

11:32.006 --> 11:34.107
Good luck, all right?

11:34.142 --> 11:35.342
All right, you know
the direction you're going?

11:35.376 --> 11:36.443
I do.

11:36.477 --> 11:37.811
Glad we got a chance to talk.

11:37.845 --> 11:40.013
I'm most concerned about Logan,

11:40.048 --> 11:41.481
because I want to make sure

11:41.516 --> 11:44.084
that he is pushing his character
as far as it will go

11:44.118 --> 11:45.519
before he molds it.

11:45.553 --> 11:46.753
See you, guys.

11:57.999 --> 11:59.967
That's time, everybody.

12:00.001 --> 12:01.268
It's the end of day one,

12:01.302 --> 12:03.337
and I'm rolling
with the punches here.

12:03.371 --> 12:04.638
I changed the sculpt,

12:04.672 --> 12:06.006
and I'm happy to have done it.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.276
But I am behind schedule,
so I need to be quick tomorrow.

12:17.051 --> 12:19.253
It's day two of our whimsical
playing card challenge,

12:19.287 --> 12:23.357
and I have 9 1/2 hours
and a lot to do.

12:23.391 --> 12:24.524
Good morning.

12:24.559 --> 12:26.360
I have to finish up my face
super quick,

12:26.394 --> 12:28.195
get my cowl busted out,

12:28.229 --> 12:30.931
and get everything molded
and cleaned.

12:30.965 --> 12:31.932
It's gonna be sweet.

12:31.966 --> 12:32.933
- Ah!
- It's gonna be sweet.

12:32.967 --> 12:34.601
Do it.
Let's do it.

12:37.839 --> 12:39.006
I think it's better.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.540
It's a lot softer.

12:43.211 --> 12:45.612
While my face mold
is setting up,

12:45.647 --> 12:47.581
I move on to the hair.

12:47.615 --> 12:50.450
I'm hoping that
by sculpting the hair,

12:50.485 --> 12:52.552
it might make mine stand out
a little bit more.

12:52.587 --> 12:56.456
So I start rolling out
individual noodles of clay

12:56.491 --> 12:59.626
and then lining them up
along the base structure,

12:59.661 --> 13:01.295
and then I'll be
smoothing it out,

13:01.329 --> 13:03.397
so it doesn't look
quite so ridiculous.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.334
I'm feeling a little bit better,

13:07.368 --> 13:11.071
but I know it's still a risk
to do a gender-swap makeup.

13:11.105 --> 13:12.539
But it's getting
a little bit better.

13:12.573 --> 13:14.708
The face is starting to look
a little bit more like a man.

13:14.742 --> 13:16.610
But I know I need to spend
more time on this.

13:16.644 --> 13:17.978
Yeah, I'd try to get these
in the mold room

13:18.012 --> 13:20.147
by the five-hour mark.

13:23.551 --> 13:27.554
Gonna have the biggest spade
of any spaders.

13:27.588 --> 13:29.589
Since I'm making
a musketeer-style character,

13:29.624 --> 13:31.958
I want to make the head
into a spade shape,

13:31.993 --> 13:33.493
so I cut out around the shape,

13:33.528 --> 13:34.928
and I start using the heat gun

13:34.962 --> 13:36.997
to get some texture
into the foam itself.

13:37.031 --> 13:39.566
I'm excited because I've never
made a hat like this before.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.301
I've made small hats for my kids

13:41.336 --> 13:42.903
but nothing
for a fabrication piece.

13:42.937 --> 13:45.539
Dude, that's badass.
That's cool.

13:48.176 --> 13:49.876
Right now
my joker's going to have

13:49.911 --> 13:52.012
a face in the front,
face in the back.

13:52.046 --> 13:54.181
But because I'm running
out of time,

13:54.215 --> 13:56.683
I'm not gonna sculpt
the second face.

13:56.718 --> 14:00.387
Instead, I'm going to finish
the first face

14:00.421 --> 14:02.856
and run a copy and latex.

14:02.890 --> 14:04.858
Then I'll have two faces.

14:04.892 --> 14:06.626
It's definitely
something different

14:06.661 --> 14:08.795
than anybody else is doing
in the room.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.534
That's pretty good.

14:15.670 --> 14:17.170
I find my red wig that I wanted

14:17.205 --> 14:18.505
and just start brushing it out.

14:18.539 --> 14:22.242
And I'm using cotton and nylon
to create a shape,

14:22.276 --> 14:25.879
and I start darkening areas
and making it more Burtonesque,

14:25.913 --> 14:29.616
and I spray it with glitter
to make it classy.

14:29.650 --> 14:30.751
[Coughs]

14:30.785 --> 14:32.886
I have this idea
that I could actually

14:32.920 --> 14:34.488
make the broken heart bleed.

14:34.522 --> 14:37.991
The idea for the chest piece
is to create this heart.

14:38.025 --> 14:40.560
I want to make him look
as if he is broken

14:40.595 --> 14:42.562
and devoid of all the blood
in his body.

14:42.597 --> 14:45.132
It could kind of lead
more towards horror, which...

14:45.166 --> 14:46.533
and you'll get kind of dinged,

14:46.567 --> 14:49.202
like, "Where's the quirky
of this character?"

14:49.237 --> 14:50.270
Rayce is right.

14:50.304 --> 14:52.706
The design that I have
is too horror,

14:52.740 --> 14:54.307
and it's supposed to whimsical.

14:54.342 --> 14:56.543
What the hell else
am I supposed to do?

14:56.577 --> 14:58.445
This is the first
individual challenge,

14:58.479 --> 15:00.180
so I need to stand out.

15:00.214 --> 15:01.815
Oh, God.

15:06.192 --> 15:08.193
I think it could go either way.

15:08.227 --> 15:10.262
I just want to let you know
that it could go either way.

15:10.296 --> 15:12.164
It's day two
of our playing card challenge,

15:12.198 --> 15:15.734
and Rayce says to me,
my chest piece is too horror.

15:15.768 --> 15:18.670
Do you think I should just cut
out the broken heart altogether?

15:18.704 --> 15:21.039
And then the only appliance
that I have would be the face.

15:21.073 --> 15:22.641
And at this point,
I'm just like,

15:22.675 --> 15:24.342
"I have to scrap
my chest piece."

15:24.377 --> 15:25.377
Focus on the face.

15:25.411 --> 15:26.845
Get this thing in the mold room.

15:26.879 --> 15:28.046
Every second counts.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.749
Now all I have is a face piece.

15:30.783 --> 15:33.418
I'm sitting here, like,
having a panic attack right now.

15:33.453 --> 15:36.688
Doubting yourself wastes time,
and nothing gets done.

15:36.722 --> 15:39.624
Now I know why people
freak out on <i>Face Off.</i>

15:39.659 --> 15:40.992
Thank you.

15:43.062 --> 15:44.029
See you later.

15:44.063 --> 15:45.030
Yeah, see you, Laura.

15:45.064 --> 15:46.164
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

15:46.199 --> 15:47.833
My time in the lab
is almost at an end.

15:47.867 --> 15:50.469
I'm very confident
that they will get the job done

15:50.503 --> 15:51.803
and get it looking good.

15:51.838 --> 15:54.673
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, see you tomorrow.

15:54.707 --> 15:55.841
I open my face mold,

15:55.875 --> 15:57.776
I clean out the clay,
and it's done.

15:57.810 --> 15:59.411
I still have to figure out

15:59.445 --> 16:00.712
what my paint scheme
is gonna be,

16:00.746 --> 16:02.581
so I pour gelatin
into the face mold,

16:02.615 --> 16:04.149
so I have some sort of piece

16:04.183 --> 16:07.118
that I can practice
pre-painting on.

16:07.153 --> 16:08.787
One hour, everybody.

16:13.993 --> 16:16.561
I just need this gelatin
to cool down,

16:16.596 --> 16:17.629
so I can peel it out.

16:17.663 --> 16:18.697
Oh, yeah.

16:18.731 --> 16:20.499
The gelatin is still
tacky and gummy,

16:20.533 --> 16:23.435
and this is just a nightmare.

16:25.505 --> 16:26.805
I'm starting to freak out.

16:26.839 --> 16:28.373
If I don't get this gelatin
cleaned out,

16:28.407 --> 16:30.041
I don't have a foam piece,
and I'm screwed.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.043
This was probably
a really bad idea.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.948
Time is dwindling,
and I run with the mold

16:36.983 --> 16:39.751
outside to the pressure washer.

16:39.785 --> 16:41.486
And I'm spraying like a madman

16:41.521 --> 16:44.623
and pouring out
as much as I can.

16:44.657 --> 16:48.660
It's working, but it was
a huge waste of my time.

16:48.694 --> 16:50.462
It basically took away time

16:50.496 --> 16:52.931
from me being able
to work on anything else.

16:52.965 --> 16:55.800
Just struggling with this.

16:55.835 --> 16:58.603
That's time, everybody.

16:58.638 --> 16:59.971
It's the end of day two.

17:00.006 --> 17:01.640
I'm feeling a little behind.

17:01.674 --> 17:03.008
The mold is ready for foam.

17:03.042 --> 17:04.108
Thank God for that.

17:04.143 --> 17:06.344
I still have to figure out
my paint scheme.

17:06.378 --> 17:09.446
I'm gonna have to really hustle
to get everything done tomorrow.

17:18.723 --> 17:19.958
It's application day.

17:19.992 --> 17:21.292
We have four hours in the lab

17:21.327 --> 17:23.461
and one hour at last looks.

17:23.496 --> 17:25.931
I know I got to get
this face painted, hand-painted,

17:25.964 --> 17:28.400
and then this guy's got to get
a wig and a full costume.

17:28.434 --> 17:29.834
I like the nostril hair.

17:29.869 --> 17:30.936
Yeah.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.137
- Cool.
- It looks pretty good.

17:32.171 --> 17:34.139
That looks really good.

17:34.173 --> 17:35.607
My prosthetic looks great,

17:35.641 --> 17:37.008
but I get some bad news.

17:37.043 --> 17:39.377
My model is not
going to be there.

17:39.412 --> 17:42.113
Let's see if your new model...

17:42.148 --> 17:43.415
Looks anything like Kevin.

17:43.449 --> 17:45.283
- Looks anything like Kevin.
- I'm hoping.

17:48.688 --> 17:50.221
- Julian.
- Augustine.

17:50.256 --> 17:51.389
Hi.

17:51.424 --> 17:52.624
How are you?

17:52.658 --> 17:54.326
All right,
who's our replacement?

17:54.360 --> 17:55.393
Is it Omar?

17:55.428 --> 17:56.595
Hey!

17:56.629 --> 17:59.297
Omar has a much narrower,
thin face.

17:59.332 --> 18:02.734
It's gonna completely change it
from, like a wide diamond

18:02.768 --> 18:04.436
to, like,
a really, really thin diamond.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.838
And I got to try and fit
Kevin's face onto your face.

18:06.872 --> 18:08.239
All right.

18:08.274 --> 18:09.941
I'm gonna make this work.
I'm rolling with it.

18:09.976 --> 18:11.042
Is that gonna be my hair?

18:11.077 --> 18:12.043
Yeah.

18:12.078 --> 18:13.979
That's awesome.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.417
Because my wig
is so big and heavy,

18:19.452 --> 18:22.153
it could easily fall off
if she moves a certain way.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.255
So I have to pin-curl
my model's hair,

18:24.290 --> 18:27.459
so I have pins
to anchor the other pins to.

18:27.493 --> 18:29.094
Hopefully it'll work.

18:29.128 --> 18:30.662
I'm sorry if I'm hurting you.

18:34.634 --> 18:36.001
So my plan for application day

18:36.035 --> 18:39.170
is to apply the cowl
and then apply the face piece.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.372
Are you gonna put this
over the face?

18:40.406 --> 18:42.474
Should it,
or should this go over that?

18:42.508 --> 18:43.475
This is gonna have
to come over this.

18:43.509 --> 18:44.576
Yeah.

18:44.610 --> 18:45.677
And then Anthony comes by,
and he goes,

18:45.711 --> 18:48.346
"No, no, no, no, no, no,
do the other way."

18:48.381 --> 18:49.781
I'd almost consider
cutting this.

18:49.815 --> 18:50.782
Right here?

18:50.816 --> 18:52.350
Then this can come over that.

18:52.385 --> 18:53.885
It's good advice,

18:53.919 --> 18:55.854
but that means
I have to cut around the cowl

18:55.888 --> 18:57.389
to make this face work on her.

18:57.423 --> 18:59.491
It's gonna take a lot of time
out of my painting.

19:03.162 --> 19:05.730
The only problem with it is,

19:05.765 --> 19:07.332
she's very feminine.

19:07.366 --> 19:10.335
I put the wig on her,
and it's not working.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.573
I am so lost, because all of
the wigs that would have worked

19:15.608 --> 19:18.043
have been taken
by all of the other contestants.

19:18.077 --> 19:21.479
I pick out this wig
that wasn't my first choice.

19:21.514 --> 19:22.914
But I go with it

19:22.948 --> 19:27.385
because I'd much rather have
a makeup out on that stage

19:27.420 --> 19:28.987
than have nothing at all.

19:29.021 --> 19:30.689
- It's time to go.
- Yeah.

19:33.159 --> 19:36.728
I'm applying a base coat
over all of the foam pieces.

19:36.762 --> 19:39.931
And then I go through
and do a darker color

19:39.965 --> 19:42.667
into all of the grooves
and cracks of the hair.

19:42.702 --> 19:45.403
So far it's coming along
really nice.

19:51.310 --> 19:52.644
- It's not white.
- It's still Tim Burton pale,

19:52.678 --> 19:54.179
but it's not, like, clown pale.

19:54.213 --> 19:55.380
Yeah.

19:56.882 --> 19:58.917
I am panicking
about the beauty makeup.

19:58.951 --> 20:00.185
We have a subtle face,

20:00.219 --> 20:02.620
so we need to do
the same thing for the paint,

20:02.655 --> 20:03.955
not go crazy.

20:03.989 --> 20:06.658
So a little bit exaggerate
but still beauty.

20:06.692 --> 20:07.659
That's just subtle enough.

20:07.693 --> 20:08.727
I wouldn't go too dark there.

20:08.761 --> 20:10.228
Okay, cool.

20:10.262 --> 20:12.864
I feel like I have
a lot to do, and I just don't...

20:12.898 --> 20:15.400
I would say
spend as much time as you can.

20:15.434 --> 20:17.102
Hold off on packing up your kit.

20:17.136 --> 20:18.803
So behind on this.

20:18.838 --> 20:20.171
I'm still trying to figure out

20:20.206 --> 20:21.840
how to get
that second face applied,

20:21.874 --> 20:27.011
and I haven't even finished
painting the front face.

20:27.046 --> 20:28.313
You don't have a back face?

20:28.347 --> 20:29.447
I do.

20:29.482 --> 20:30.882
I just don't know
how to put it on.

20:30.916 --> 20:32.851
I'm concerned because now

20:32.885 --> 20:35.086
I know that it's gonna be
a last looks thing.

20:35.121 --> 20:37.055
It's 30 minutes, guys.

20:41.427 --> 20:43.194
It's time, everybody.

20:43.229 --> 20:44.496
Ah, shit.

20:44.530 --> 20:46.264
I don't think
I'm gonna get this all done.

20:46.298 --> 20:47.665
Good luck.

20:47.700 --> 20:51.469
I still got to put this face
on the back and paint it.

20:51.504 --> 20:54.973
It's an extreme amount
of work to do

20:55.007 --> 20:56.975
for my first
individual challenge.

20:57.009 --> 20:59.778
Might be putting a makeup
onstage that's not finished.

21:09.490 --> 21:11.090
It's coming off right here.

21:11.125 --> 21:13.026
At last looks, we have one hour,

21:13.060 --> 21:15.895
and the first thing I notice
is that my lip just came loose.

21:15.930 --> 21:18.431
I don't want to go home
because of that.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.369
I absolutely need to add
that face in the back.

21:23.404 --> 21:25.346
- Do you feel like it's gonna fall off at all?
- No.

21:25.406 --> 21:26.873
If I don't get that done,

21:26.907 --> 21:29.342
then I don't have
the character that I want.

21:30.711 --> 21:32.145
Emily, do you have one second?

21:32.179 --> 21:33.379
Emily's incredible.

21:33.414 --> 21:35.048
She told me,
"When you put the eyelashes,

21:35.082 --> 21:36.749
just ask me,
and I do for you."

21:36.784 --> 21:39.752
Without Emily,
I have nothing to show onstage.

21:39.787 --> 21:41.454
Thank you, Emily.

21:41.488 --> 21:43.556
I put the crown on,
and it's just another thing

21:43.591 --> 21:45.491
thrown into this tornado
of crap.

21:45.526 --> 21:47.293
And I know it'll probably
end me up in bottom.

21:47.328 --> 21:49.095
Ten minutes, everyone.

21:57.071 --> 21:58.872
All right, guys, that's time.

21:58.906 --> 22:00.506
Thank you.

22:00.541 --> 22:02.876
I just feel broken right now.

22:02.910 --> 22:05.211
All I can do is hope
that I'm safe.

22:14.321 --> 22:17.423
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

22:17.458 --> 22:21.027
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

22:21.061 --> 22:22.462
But before we see
your creations,

22:22.496 --> 22:25.131
let's say hello
to our series judges.

22:25.165 --> 22:26.266
Glenn Hetrick.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.267
Good evening.

22:27.301 --> 22:28.268
- Hi.
- Hello.

22:28.302 --> 22:29.269
Ve Neill.

22:29.303 --> 22:30.336
Good evening, everybody.

22:30.371 --> 22:31.337
- Hi, Ve.
- Hello.

22:31.372 --> 22:32.372
And Neville Page.

22:32.406 --> 22:33.373
Hi, guys.

22:33.407 --> 22:34.807
- Hi.
- Hi, Neville.

22:34.842 --> 22:36.743
And we have a very special guest

22:36.777 --> 22:38.411
joining our panel tonight.

22:38.445 --> 22:40.146
He is a true triple threat,

22:40.180 --> 22:42.115
having won five Emmys
for his work

22:42.149 --> 22:44.217
as a visual effects artist,

22:44.251 --> 22:46.519
two Academy Awards
as a production designer

22:46.553 --> 22:50.757
on <i> Avatar</i> and Tim Burton's
<i>Alice In Wonderland,</i>

22:50.791 --> 22:54.227
and he just directed
his first feature film,

22:54.261 --> 22:55.528
<i>Maleficent.</i>

22:55.562 --> 22:59.132
Please give a warm welcome
to Mr. Robert Stromberg.

22:59.166 --> 23:02.435
[Applause]

23:02.469 --> 23:04.337
I am a huge fan of his work,

23:04.371 --> 23:05.838
and if there's anybody

23:05.873 --> 23:08.775
who knows the Tim Burton
<i>Alice In Wonderland</i> feel,

23:08.809 --> 23:10.143
it's Robert Stromberg.

23:10.177 --> 23:11.978
Thank you so much
for being here, Robert.

23:12.012 --> 23:13.379
It's a pleasure to be here.

23:13.414 --> 23:14.847
How about we check out
some makeups?

23:14.882 --> 23:15.949
Definitely.

23:15.983 --> 23:17.550
Okay, this week,

23:17.584 --> 23:20.553
for your first individual
spotlight challenge,

23:20.587 --> 23:24.190
I asked you to each choose
a royal playing card

23:24.224 --> 23:27.460
and bring it to life
in an outlandish and quirky way

23:27.494 --> 23:29.796
worthy of a Tim Burton film.

23:29.830 --> 23:33.733
Champions, let's take a look
at your proteges' creations.

23:33.767 --> 23:36.736
[Dramatic music]

23:36.770 --> 23:44.777
♪ ♪

23:58.225 --> 24:00.093
He's way too vampire to me,

24:00.127 --> 24:03.629
but I think he has
a dark Tim Burton look to him.

24:20.414 --> 24:21.781
All I can think about is,

24:21.815 --> 24:23.483
it may look good from afar,

24:23.517 --> 24:24.884
but up close, it's rough.

24:24.918 --> 24:26.519
It is really rough.

24:45.806 --> 24:48.074
She really pops onstage.

24:48.108 --> 24:51.677
I'm just like, "Ooh, I love you.

24:51.712 --> 24:53.513
You look so good."

25:10.764 --> 25:12.331
I think she looks fantastic,

25:12.366 --> 25:14.767
but she's got a goatee.

25:14.802 --> 25:17.103
She's elegant and beautiful
and bearded.

25:34.655 --> 25:36.789
He's looking really good,
but I'm still worried

25:36.824 --> 25:38.424
that they're gonna think
that my concept

25:38.459 --> 25:41.561
is too on the nose
or just too out there.

25:58.712 --> 26:00.046
I'm ecstatic right now.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.814
I'm feeling like
I could have a top look.

26:01.849 --> 26:04.317
I'm just hoping that it's
whimsical enough for the judges.

26:21.902 --> 26:24.103
It stands out
but not in a good way.

26:24.138 --> 26:25.805
It doesn't read
as a king of clubs.

26:25.839 --> 26:29.275
It just reads as a pimp.

26:46.527 --> 26:48.194
He's doing his jig,
and it's really funny.

26:48.228 --> 26:49.395
It looks great.

26:49.429 --> 26:51.430
He looks just like
the way I envisioned him.

27:09.316 --> 27:12.585
This is not 100% my best work,

27:12.619 --> 27:15.721
but she looks like a queen...
sort of.

27:33.674 --> 27:35.374
I'm really happy
with the silhouette.

27:35.409 --> 27:36.776
It looks very royal.

27:36.810 --> 27:38.978
I feel really happy
with what I've accomplished

27:39.012 --> 27:40.413
in the past two days.

27:59.366 --> 28:02.435
You really can't tell
which side is which,

28:02.469 --> 28:04.537
so I'm excited
about how this looks.

28:22.456 --> 28:23.756
I feel like it's whimsical.

28:23.790 --> 28:26.259
It really looks like
what I had envisioned,

28:26.293 --> 28:28.427
and I'm really happy
with this one.

28:45.846 --> 28:47.113
The sculpture looks nice.

28:47.147 --> 28:50.716
It's just, everything around it
is just terrible.

28:50.751 --> 28:53.052
And I'm embarrassed
to be saying that it's mine.

29:00.093 --> 29:03.229
Okay, judges, why don't you
check out the royal court?

29:11.038 --> 29:13.306
Looks like this edge is
really rough along the bottom.

29:13.340 --> 29:14.807
Just a little.

29:14.841 --> 29:16.042
Thank you.

29:18.679 --> 29:20.546
Oh, this is
quite a bit rougher up close.

29:20.580 --> 29:21.714
Wow.

29:21.748 --> 29:23.316
It almost has
a carved wood feel to it.

29:23.350 --> 29:25.418
There's just too many
different elements going on.

29:25.452 --> 29:26.585
Yeah.

29:28.955 --> 29:30.122
This makes me sad.

29:30.157 --> 29:31.757
I love that it has
that very clear,

29:31.792 --> 29:32.992
easy-to-read emotion.

29:33.026 --> 29:34.527
I do like
some of the paint work,

29:34.561 --> 29:36.228
even though it's very simple.

29:36.263 --> 29:37.430
Thank you.

29:40.133 --> 29:41.934
His patch is a bit too big.

29:41.968 --> 29:44.437
It looks like it's patching
the whole side of his head.

29:44.471 --> 29:46.505
I might want to see
the rest of it,

29:46.540 --> 29:48.207
how this transitions.

29:48.241 --> 29:49.375
Oh, man.

29:49.409 --> 29:52.578
I see Glenn pulling
the actual appliance.

29:52.612 --> 29:54.714
The appliance
is falling off my model's face.

29:54.748 --> 29:56.315
I'm probably going home
because of that,

29:56.350 --> 29:57.717
and I'm crushed.

30:00.654 --> 30:03.622
Tell us who made your favorite
quirky royal character

30:03.657 --> 30:06.292

30:10.077 --> 30:11.043
Ooh.

30:11.078 --> 30:12.211
Oh, man.

30:12.246 --> 30:13.813
The appliance came loose.

30:13.847 --> 30:14.914
This is terrible.

30:14.948 --> 30:16.349
I don't want to go home
at this point.

30:16.383 --> 30:18.251
I'm frustrated
because I really wanted to shine

30:18.285 --> 30:19.719
for the first
individual challenge.

30:19.753 --> 30:21.153
These edges are ripped out.

30:21.188 --> 30:22.922
We have several blowouts.

30:24.658 --> 30:27.760
This gives bee-stung lips
a whole new definition.

30:27.794 --> 30:30.563
It destroys any of the beauty
that was intentional.

30:30.597 --> 30:32.498
I think if I had this
in one of my films,

30:32.532 --> 30:34.834
I would want the eyes
more readable.

30:34.868 --> 30:36.669
Thank you.

30:36.703 --> 30:37.670
Nice.

30:37.704 --> 30:38.838
I really like this one.

30:38.872 --> 30:41.641
That profile,
between the hair and the piece,

30:41.675 --> 30:42.975
is gorgeous.

30:43.010 --> 30:45.444
Thank you.

30:45.479 --> 30:47.013
This is really interesting.

30:47.047 --> 30:48.481
She was really smart.

30:48.515 --> 30:51.284
She left it way down here,
so it wouldn't affect his mouth.

30:51.318 --> 30:54.186
- Yeah, it was very clean.
- Yeah.

the story could possibly be.

31:29.823 --> 31:31.257
All right, that means
the rest of you

31:31.291 --> 31:33.459
were the best
and the worst this week,

31:33.493 --> 31:35.394
and the judges would like
to speak with each of you

31:35.429 --> 31:36.796
to learn more about your work.

31:36.830 --> 31:38.531
Darla, please step up.

31:46.807 --> 31:48.040
Tell us about your character

31:48.075 --> 31:50.309
and how you used the card
to drive your design.

31:50.344 --> 31:52.111
So I had the jack of hearts.

31:52.145 --> 31:55.848
My character is the royal
advisor to the king of hearts,

31:55.882 --> 31:58.217
but he's secretly in love
with the queen,

31:58.251 --> 32:00.319
and so he's jealous of the king.

32:00.354 --> 32:03.389
I think it's brilliant.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.623
Very stunning.

32:04.658 --> 32:07.426
And I particularly love
the application technique.

32:07.461 --> 32:10.596
I can't look at it and go,
"Here's exactly how you did it."

32:10.630 --> 32:13.332
That thrills me to no end.

32:13.367 --> 32:17.269
The subtlety of the paint work
around the edge of the heart,

32:17.304 --> 32:20.573
that's very sophisticated
modeling technique.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.041
I love this.

Thank you.

32:23.143 --> 32:24.744
Really nice job framing the face

to sculpt the hair.

interpretation of your vision.

32:47.667 --> 32:49.201
The history
of the king of spades

32:49.236 --> 32:51.404
plays off of David and Goliath.

32:51.438 --> 32:53.806
But instead of playing,
like, the tall, proud man

32:53.840 --> 32:55.107
that David is,

32:55.142 --> 32:58.277
I decided to make a very
proud person but very small.

32:58.311 --> 32:59.845
He's a little bit
of a dandy, then.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.180
Yes.

33:01.214 --> 33:04.717
I'm not sure that
that was such a good choice.

33:04.751 --> 33:06.552
The kings
are supposed to be regal.

33:06.586 --> 33:08.621
The sculpting on it
is very, very rough,

33:08.655 --> 33:11.590
and you could have put
more texture into the face.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.926
There's some good shapes
happening,

33:13.960 --> 33:16.095
but it's
all about the execution,

33:16.129 --> 33:17.930
and the sculpted hair

33:17.964 --> 33:20.032
feels more like the top
of a Klingon's head.

33:20.066 --> 33:23.335
It has that shape
versus styled hair.

33:23.370 --> 33:25.771
The paint job is very drab.

33:25.806 --> 33:28.474
You've got to be able to deliver
that killer paint job,

33:28.508 --> 33:31.076
and that didn't happen.

33:31.111 --> 33:32.978
Jamie, if you'd please
step back.

33:37.884 --> 33:40.719
All right, let's talk to Emily.

33:43.723 --> 33:46.091
So tell us about your character

33:46.126 --> 33:48.060
and how the card inspired this.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.662
She is the queen of hearts.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.864
Immediately I thought
of human heart,

33:51.898 --> 33:55.668
so I wanted to incorporate
the hearts into her collar

33:55.702 --> 33:57.670
and play with the shapes.

33:57.704 --> 34:01.440
Everything about this
is so beautiful.

34:01.475 --> 34:03.509
From the head shape to profile,

34:03.543 --> 34:05.578
it's a beautiful,
beautiful design.

34:05.612 --> 34:06.645
Thank you.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.214
When I did <i>Alice In Wonderland,</i>

34:08.248 --> 34:12.384
we would have gobbled that idea
up about being real hearts,

34:12.418 --> 34:13.686
and they would be beating.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.954
I think you did a good job.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.088
Thank you.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.456
There's one thing about this

34:17.491 --> 34:18.924
that, honestly, I hate,

34:18.958 --> 34:21.260
and that is
how much better you are

34:21.293 --> 34:23.462
than I was when I was your age.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.530
[Laughs]

34:24.563 --> 34:26.031
It's really hard not to love it.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.666
Thank you.

34:27.701 --> 34:30.436
Emily, you can step back.

34:30.469 --> 34:31.904
Thanks, Megan.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.241
Nice job, lady.

34:35.275 --> 34:36.242
- Thanks.
- Nice.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.877
Anthony, please come forward.

34:45.318 --> 34:47.553
Hey, Anthony.
Tell us about your character.

34:47.587 --> 34:50.022
The king of hearts
was once this great ruler,

34:50.056 --> 34:52.491
and the spades attacked
and killed his queen,

34:52.525 --> 34:54.159
which caused him
to have a broken heart.

34:54.194 --> 34:57.296
Honestly, I feel like
there's a few problems here.

34:58.932 --> 35:01.333
I think that the paint work
feels muddled,

35:01.368 --> 35:03.435
like a combination
of many thoughts

35:03.470 --> 35:06.939
that didn't coagulate
into one single form.

35:06.973 --> 35:10.809
The hair is an absolute mess.

35:10.844 --> 35:12.411
And I'm using a nice word.

35:12.445 --> 35:13.412
No.

35:13.446 --> 35:14.847
In close-up, it's so horrible,

35:14.881 --> 35:17.116
it's not even
a good clown makeup.

35:18.685 --> 35:20.819
Anthony, you can step down.

35:20.854 --> 35:22.121
Thank you.

35:28.061 --> 35:29.795
Daniel, if you'd please step up.

35:34.768 --> 35:37.269
Please tell us the concept
behind your makeup.

35:37.304 --> 35:39.038
I got the queen of diamonds,

35:39.072 --> 35:43.108
and she's hunting for diamonds
in all the kingdoms.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.978
This is conceptually
unintelligible to me.

35:48.481 --> 35:49.915
If you weren't telling me,

35:49.950 --> 35:53.352
I wouldn't have known
that's the queen of diamonds.

35:53.386 --> 35:55.554
One of the huge mistakes
that you made

35:55.589 --> 35:57.623
was trying to put
a three-dimensional diamond

35:57.657 --> 35:58.724
on her mouth,

35:58.758 --> 36:00.759
because it looks like
she's deformed.

36:00.794 --> 36:02.494
I feel like you went into it

36:02.529 --> 36:04.063
with a little bit
of uncertainty,

36:04.097 --> 36:07.800
and being whimsical is not being
afraid to go too far.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.837
Daniel, you can step down.

36:11.871 --> 36:13.305
Thank you.

36:16.743 --> 36:18.077
Julian.

36:23.817 --> 36:26.452
Julian, would you please
tell us about your character?

36:26.486 --> 36:28.454
My card was the jack of clubs,

36:28.488 --> 36:31.624
and he made a deal
with the king of the underworld,

36:31.658 --> 36:34.560
so he helps with ferrying
the dead to the underworld.

36:34.594 --> 36:39.398
This is a really interesting,
bizarre-looking makeup.

36:39.432 --> 36:42.868
I like the way that you actually
did take the shape of the club,

36:42.902 --> 36:46.805
but you have this great little
damaged section of his forehead.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.340
And it's really out of the box.

36:48.375 --> 36:49.375
I really like it.

36:49.409 --> 36:50.609
Thank you.

36:50.644 --> 36:52.277
It's not on the nose,
it's not literal,

36:52.312 --> 36:53.412
and that's a good thing.

36:53.446 --> 36:56.415
Yours is one of the only ones
that stood out.

36:56.449 --> 36:58.951
You have shown
some serious skills

36:58.985 --> 37:01.687
in the sculpting, painting,
and applying of the makeup.

37:01.721 --> 37:03.222
Thank you.

37:03.256 --> 37:04.657
Julian, please step back.

37:04.691 --> 37:05.758
Thanks.

37:11.164 --> 37:12.364
Thank you, guys.

37:12.399 --> 37:13.732
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

37:13.767 --> 37:15.801
while the judges deliberate.

37:18.838 --> 37:21.206
All right, judges, let's start
with your favorites tonight.

37:21.241 --> 37:22.474
How about Darla's work?

37:22.509 --> 37:23.776
I love it.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.711
She's the only one
that pulled off the pointy chin

37:25.745 --> 37:27.146
and had it work visually.

37:27.180 --> 37:28.881
Yeah, technically solid.

37:28.915 --> 37:31.383
The overall graphic of it,
very solid.

37:31.418 --> 37:33.152
I think
it was absolutely stunning,

37:33.186 --> 37:36.088
and she put the rest
of the competitors on notice.

37:36.122 --> 37:38.257
She is going to be
a force to be reckoned with.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.325
All right, judges,
let's move on to Emily.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.660
Just stunning.

37:41.695 --> 37:44.296
The hearts with the arrows
and the whole schmegegge,

37:44.330 --> 37:45.330
it was awesome.

37:45.365 --> 37:47.900
She did heart face, heart hair,

37:47.934 --> 37:49.902
hearts around her collar.

37:49.936 --> 37:52.471
It would have seemed like
too much of a good thing,

37:52.505 --> 37:55.441
but because they were nuanced,
they just echoed.

37:55.475 --> 37:57.976
All right, judges,
let's move on to Julian.

37:58.011 --> 38:01.180
I do admire the subtleties
of the scarring,

38:01.214 --> 38:02.815
and there was a certain flow
to it.

38:02.849 --> 38:05.284
There's some beautiful
sculpting and painting on it.

38:05.318 --> 38:08.454
It's just its own unique vision.

38:08.488 --> 38:10.322
All right, judges, let's move on

38:10.356 --> 38:12.458
to the looks you like the least.

38:12.492 --> 38:14.593
Let's talk about Jamie's work tonight.

38:14.627 --> 38:17.296
It's a king's face
with a spade haircut.

38:17.330 --> 38:18.764
That's not a very good idea.

38:18.798 --> 38:20.666
She had the choice
not to use that head piece.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.101
She could have put
real hair on it.

38:22.135 --> 38:23.502
Which I think she should have.

38:23.536 --> 38:26.271
There was too many pieces
that didn't fit together.

38:26.306 --> 38:28.307
Let's move on to Anthony.

38:28.341 --> 38:29.808
You can't overlook
the paint job.

38:29.843 --> 38:32.244
I've seen more kingly bowls
of spaghetti,

38:32.278 --> 38:33.378
to be honest with you.

38:33.413 --> 38:35.981
Simple illustration-style
makeup,

38:36.015 --> 38:37.516
it's the hardest thing to do,

38:37.550 --> 38:39.718
because it's just
a couple colors and some lines,

38:39.753 --> 38:41.186
and they have to be perfect.

38:41.221 --> 38:44.890
Visually, it read more
like a hybrid tribal mask

38:44.924 --> 38:47.626
than it did a playing card.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.962
Okay, let's move on to Daniel.

38:49.996 --> 38:51.730
He was so lost.

38:51.765 --> 38:55.400
That was so shoddily sculpted,
applied, and painted.

38:55.435 --> 38:57.069
At the core of it,
the problem is,

38:57.103 --> 38:59.471
the concept for the makeup
is nonexistent.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.440
Why didn't he at least
do some sort of

39:01.474 --> 39:02.941
cool, monstery-looking queen...

39:02.976 --> 39:04.209
Precisely.

39:04.244 --> 39:06.145
With, like, diamonds
protruding out of her skin

39:06.179 --> 39:07.412
and give it the Tim Burton look?

39:07.447 --> 39:09.314
At least it would have been
something creative.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.617
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

39:11.651 --> 39:12.651
- We have.
- Yes.

39:12.685 --> 39:14.419
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:23.797 --> 39:26.231
So, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

39:26.266 --> 39:29.735
Darla, your jack
had a powerful presence,

39:29.769 --> 39:31.303
and you really impressed us

39:31.337 --> 39:33.372
both with
your beautiful application

39:33.406 --> 39:35.240
and your technical prowess.

39:35.275 --> 39:38.811
Emily, your queen was replete
with graceful forms

39:38.845 --> 39:40.212
and great colors,

39:40.246 --> 39:41.513
and it all came together

39:41.548 --> 39:44.750
into a beautifully unified
finished product.

39:44.784 --> 39:47.119
Julian, the sculpture
of your face

39:47.153 --> 39:49.288
showed some strong
technical talent,

and the uniqueness
of your character

39:51.558 --> 39:53.058

I've got to congratulate you
