03:16.080 --> 03:18.276
I'm afraid it's a no, Frank.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.119
Well, well, well.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.554
That's a body blow, I can tell you.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.120
I am sorry.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.032
A blow.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.759
No two ways about that.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.189
Five more years, eh?

03:34.920 --> 03:36.274
What do they think I am?

03:37.320 --> 03:40.199
They think I'm like one of those cunts
in the Bible that live forever?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.430
Is that what they think?

03:41.520 --> 03:44.991
- I'm not sure. They make an assessment.
- I've written letters, you know.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.594
Letters to every cunt.
Even wrote to the Queen.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.235
- You've written to the Queen?
- Aye.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.152
Never got back to us, like.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.914
Too fucking busy to speak
to the working classes.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.480
Different story when she needs a soldier.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.680
"Step this way, Mr Begbie."
"Sign here, Mr Begbie."

03:57.760 --> 03:59.479
I didn't know you'd served in the army.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.031
I haven't. How could I?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.918
I've been in the fucking jail for 20 years.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.117
- You not fucking notice?
- Of course, of course.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.319
Diminished responsibility.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.672
If that cunt in the original trial had put on

04:10.760 --> 04:12.638
a proper defence
of diminished responsibility,

04:12.720 --> 04:14.552
I could've walked out that door a free man.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.391
I think, for you, that the best policy...

04:19.480 --> 04:20.470
Did you mention it?

04:21.800 --> 04:24.031
The diminished responsibility.
Did you mention it?

04:24.840 --> 04:28.277
- At the hearing?
- Aye. Did you?

04:28.360 --> 04:31.114
- I felt it was more constructive...
- Didn't fucking mention it.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.600
I cannot believe it.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.877
What was the last fucking thing I told you?

04:35.040 --> 04:37.919
Mind and mention
the diminished responsibility,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.832
you fucking dumb cunt!

04:39.920 --> 04:44.756
I think it would be better
if we brought this meeting to a close,

04:44.840 --> 04:46.399
and you and I get together

04:46.880 --> 04:49.873
once you've had time
to reflect upon the situation.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.869
So you gonna press
that little yellow button or no?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.234
Cunt!

05:02.400 --> 05:03.800
Daylight saving.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.630
Me, I'm no one way or another
when it comes to daylight.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.396
Like, neither a saver nor a spender.
More like just agnostic, you know?

05:10.800 --> 05:15.158
Unfortunately, daylight hasn't shown
the same ambivalence towards me.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.239
I had a job... Construction.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.751
Labouring, a bit of carpentry,
a bit of plumbing now and again.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.320
I mean, it wasn't my first
choice of vocation,

05:21.400 --> 05:23.676
but the cuts at the benefit office
made it clear.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.638
No coal, no dole.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.518
So, I'm off the skag.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.752
I'm seeing Gail, little Fergus,
though he's not so little any more,

05:29.840 --> 05:31.035
but this was back then.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.430
Basically, I'm holding it together.

05:33.640 --> 05:38.157
Then, one morning, I gets to work
and gets fired for being an hour late.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.512
And then, one hour late at the DSS
to explain why I lost the job.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.274
And an hour late to appeal
against losing my benefits.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.113
And an hour late
for my work-focused interview.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.396
An hour late for
my supervised visit with little Fergus.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.757
And late again to
social services to explain why.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.833
Eventually, I let on to it.
It was the clocks.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.757
Going forward one hour.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.471
British Summer Time, they calls it.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.960
It wasn't even warm.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.315
I was still wearing a jumper.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.558
"Happens every year, Mr Murphy."

06:07.640 --> 06:10.155
How was I supposed to know?
I've been on skag for 15 years.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.436
You know how it is... Daylight isn't exactly
high on your agenda when you got a habit.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.752
It's for farmers and that.
Dudes who need to tend to the livestock.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.315
It's not for junkies who need to score.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.678
So that was me. No job, no money.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.520
No access to the little fella.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.195
And then you went back on the heroin.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.595
My best friend.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.995
Actually, only friend who's never left us.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.674
What is this?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.479
- This is for you.
- What?

06:56.760 --> 06:57.830
It's a recording.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.593
A keepsake so the memory need never fade.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.955
- Who are you?
- I'm your blackmailer.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.793
And your salvation.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.715
You cooperate with me,
no one will ever see this video.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.440
Now, my research suggests that,

07:13.520 --> 07:16.957
as deputy headmaster of one of
Edinburgh's leading private schools,

07:17.040 --> 07:19.475
you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.438
It's not in my interest
to squeeze you too hard,

07:21.520 --> 07:23.796
and it's not in your interest to provoke me.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.553
So let's meet in the middle.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.799
10% of your salary per annum.
Paid monthly on a rolling, indefinite basis.

07:29.880 --> 07:34.591
You disgusting shit!
I will not stand for this!

07:36.160 --> 07:38.550
Naturally, you'll have to lie to your wife.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.917
If you need inspiration,
just imagine her reaction to that.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.355
Or how this might interest
the pupils of that leading private school.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.319
I think they might enjoy
the interlude with the strap-on.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.880
I know I did.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.394
I'm gonna text you the details
of a bank account.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.518
I expect to see a £1,000 payment in there
by the end of the week.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.396
Hi!

08:23.320 --> 08:26.392
- Welcome to Edinburgh.
- Welcome to Edinburgh.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.196
Welcome to Edinburgh.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.999
Hi. Welcome to Edinburgh.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.236
- Welcome to Edinburgh.
- Hi. Welcome to Edinburgh.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.515
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

08:34.600 --> 08:35.828
Where are you from?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.792
- Slovenia.
- Oh.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.634
Franco?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.314
Franco.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.989
Come on in.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.070
All right?

09:39.160 --> 09:40.310
- You ready?
- Aye.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.830
You got it?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.234
I hope you've not been fucking drinking.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.079
- No, no way, Franco, man.
- Right.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.798
Once here. Once here. Not too deep.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.314
Just two little jabs. Bit of blood.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.232
- No damage. All right?
- Right. No bother, Franco.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.118
All right. All right, do it.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.793
- Are you sure?
- Just fucking do it.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.953
You fucking prick!

10:02.440 --> 10:05.319
- You've stabbed us in the liver.
- Shit. Sorry, Franco.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.437
Shit. You still want me to do the second one?

10:07.520 --> 10:10.957
No, no, you're all right, Dozo, son.
I think you've done quite enough already.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.360
Shit.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.875
Fuck.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.675
Grease me up.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.030
Give it tight, though.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.672
Slap it. Slap it.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.555
Shit!

11:28.200 --> 11:30.431
Hey! Hey! Don't fucking touch her!

11:30.520 --> 11:32.000
Don't you fucking touch her.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.355
You in this with her, are you?

11:33.440 --> 11:35.477
You fuck! Fuck off!

11:40.600 --> 11:43.877
I see you again, cunt, you fucking die.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.758
Fuck off!

11:59.600 --> 12:01.319
- Where were you?
- I was just next door.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.470
You took a long time.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.159
We should get a new clock.
This thing looks too obvious.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.235
- I'm not doing this again.
- We'll take a break from it.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.073
- Okay?
- No, Simon.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.480
I said I'm not doing this.

12:12.640 --> 12:13.596
I feel sick.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.080
Well, calm down, okay?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.560
Worked the first time okay, didn't it?

12:16.680 --> 12:18.637
- I'm going back to work for Doyle.
- Doyle?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.678
No, no, no, you're not doing that.
Not in the sauna.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.160
- Why not?
- Doyle's a gangster.

12:22.680 --> 12:26.276
In the sauna, no man would dare
to hurt a woman.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.079
Mr Doyle won't let that happen.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.800
I don't like to think
of you working there, okay?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.519
Why not? Because I fuck men?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.313
How is this better?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.437
I could have been killed
and you would have done nothing

12:36.520 --> 12:39.354
because you were sitting next door,
taking cocaine.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.192
Please, I want to go home.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.352
It was very peaceful at the end.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.999
She kept your room exactly how you left it.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.836
She always hoped you'd come back someday.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.950
"Gail.

14:32.280 --> 14:36.877
"I wish that I could find
better words today to tell you I'm sorry.

14:36.960 --> 14:41.477
"You shouldn't have to read this,
because I already made you suffer too much.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.029
"But I know that you and Fergus

14:44.160 --> 14:46.914
"are living in a better world
without all my chaos.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.476
"I'm sorry for all the things I destroyed.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.833
"You are so beautiful.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.438
"The most beautiful in the world.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.474
"And I only ever made this world ugly.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.080
"Fergus needs things to be simpler.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.833
"I know how embarrassed he is about me.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.231
"I could not be the man that you both need.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.676
"I've tried and tried and tried for 20 years,
and everything I try is another disaster.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.830
"I love you.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.391
"I love Fergus more than anything.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.073
"But I'm finished, Gail.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.480
"I'm sorry.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.914
"Love you both.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.390
"I want to see you both smile again.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.474
"Danny boy."

16:00.560 --> 16:02.040
Fuck.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.275
Spud!

16:12.240 --> 16:13.435
Spud.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.550
Spud!

16:42.440 --> 16:43.430
Spud.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.598
Fucking hell!

16:47.320 --> 16:48.754
Fuck!

16:54.520 --> 16:55.590
Fuck!

17:01.120 --> 17:02.554
Fuck.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.348
You!

17:07.440 --> 17:09.511
- You, you bastard!
- What?

17:09.599 --> 17:12.160
What the fuck are you doing to me?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.755
I was just fucking saving your life!

17:14.839 --> 17:16.559
Save my life?

17:16.640 --> 17:21.920
You ruined my fucking life, Mark.
You ruined it!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.436
Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!

17:25.520 --> 17:27.477
Thanks a lot, amigo.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.995
Fucking shit! I did what I could for you!

17:30.080 --> 17:31.992
I gave you £4,000!

17:32.800 --> 17:37.875
What did you think
I was gonna do with £4,000, Mark?

17:38.480 --> 17:40.437
I was a fucking junkie!

17:42.720 --> 17:44.154
Aye, suppose you were.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.040
I still am!

17:52.480 --> 17:53.880
Fuck's sake.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.796
You're looking well, though, Mark.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.710
Aye.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.955
Everyone says that.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.559
Gonna be sticking around for a while?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.832
No, I'm supposed to go back
in a couple of days.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.590
Can you not stay a bit longer?

18:18.680 --> 18:22.720
It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know,
spend some time together.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.280
I don't know. I don't know.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.350
I missed you, man.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.072
Don't go trying to kill yourself again, eh?

18:30.800 --> 18:33.793
No. Not while I got my friend in town, eh?

18:38.280 --> 18:39.350
So...

18:39.800 --> 18:41.029
You see old Simon?

18:42.360 --> 18:44.636
Simon? No, no. He's probably too busy.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.434
You got to see old Simon, man.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.795
You know how it was, Spud.

18:47.880 --> 18:52.079
You and Simon was like that, man.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.315
Hello, Frank.
How are you feeling this morning?

18:55.680 --> 18:56.796
A bit sore, doll.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.236
Well, I'm sure we'll soon
be able to get rid of these tubes.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.835
Thanks, darling.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.392
Give us your wrist, Frank.
I'm off for a dump.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.790
Come on. Give us a break.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.155
That's the regulations, Frank.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.074
Where the fuck am I going to go,
all these tubes stuck to me?

19:16.920 --> 19:19.833
Give a man a little bit
of dignity for once, eh?

19:19.920 --> 19:20.910
Aye.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.514
All right, Frank.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.912
You're a good man, Mr Wilson.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.550
I respect you for that.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.434
Ya fucking prick.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.310
Excuse me, sir.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.990
Are you all right?

20:00.280 --> 20:03.478
- Can I help?
- Aye. You can.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.510
Hello, Mark.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.390
Simon.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.831
So, what you been up to for 20 years?

21:05.840 --> 21:07.160
I've been in Amsterdam.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.680
- Nice.
- All right.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.634
What else? Married?

21:11.920 --> 21:12.990
Aye.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.600
- Nice.
- Dutch woman.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.390
- Kids?
- Two.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.676
- Boys or girls?
- One of each.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.029
Little Mark, eh?

21:25.080 --> 21:26.673
Bet he's a chip off the old block.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.109
James, actually.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.036
And Laura.

21:31.880 --> 21:32.996
How about you?

21:34.760 --> 21:35.876
I have a son.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.791
He's in London with his fucking whore mother.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.352
- See him?
- Pretty regular.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.280
Currently once every 10 years.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.116
All right.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.790
Job?

21:50.920 --> 21:51.990
Aye.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.352
I did an accounting course.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.079
I work for a small business.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.231
Stock management software
for the retail sector.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.549
Very nice.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.673
Well, as you can see,
I'm running my old auntie's pub.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.594
Very few customers and they don't spend much.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.320
Sometimes it's not even worth opening.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.877
The great wave of gentrification
has yet to engulf us.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.879
But there we go, eh?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.519
- My lot in life.
- I see.

22:21.280 --> 22:26.230
£16,000!

22:26.600 --> 22:28.910
You thieving fucking bastard!

22:29.120 --> 22:31.555
You missed a trick!
That's what hurts, isn't it?

22:32.120 --> 22:36.000
That I had the brains and the fucking balls
to steal the money and you didn't!

22:37.200 --> 22:39.078
Fucking get off me.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.440
- Fucking hell!
- Bastard.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.120
Shit! Fuck!

22:59.000 --> 23:00.639
You fucking bastard.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.399
Are you all right?

23:45.280 --> 23:46.714
It will be fine.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.150
Where is she?

24:01.920 --> 24:02.990
None of your business.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.590
Saved your life, though.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.359
This is for you.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.040
Fuck's sake.

24:26.360 --> 24:27.999
We did a deal back then.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.799
Twenty years ago.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.112
Couple of bags of H. Good quality stuff.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.238
We took it to London.
Me, him, Begbie, Spud Murphy.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.356
Sold it.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.760
Not a bad price.

24:38.880 --> 24:42.078
£16,000, to be divided in four equal parts.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.795
He ran off with it.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.356
Took it all.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.914
And now what does he think I am, a whore?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.229
He can just pay me off?

24:49.320 --> 24:51.596
£4,000, not even any interest.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.873
What am I supposed to do with that?
Buy a fucking time machine?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.633
Live my life all over again?

24:56.720 --> 25:01.237
Only this time without being robbed
and betrayed by my best fucking friend!

25:02.680 --> 25:05.275
No, it doesn't work like that.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.517
What I'm gonna do, Veronika,

25:08.600 --> 25:14.119
is I'm gonna draw him back in as my friend,
my very best friend, my partner,

25:14.200 --> 25:15.395
and then I'm gonna hurt him.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.439
I'm gonna hurt him in every way that I can.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.150
- £200 short.
- I owed someone.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.356
Yeah, you bought cocaine.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.840
Shut it.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.954
Veronika...

25:31.400 --> 25:34.199
I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.511
Shut up! What's the fucking matter with you?

25:58.600 --> 25:59.716
Frank, is that you?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.029
Who the fuck else it gonna be?

26:01.200 --> 26:02.998
But the police might be watching.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.796
Well, that's why I came
in the back window, woman.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.109
Do you still got my kitbag?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.270
- Of course.
- Good.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.790
Frank, you're bleeding.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.315
It's nothing.
Just get us a plaster or something.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.069
Here, let me.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.150
No, leave it, leave it.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.310
Dad?

26:24.280 --> 26:25.953
Franco Junior.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.680
Ya cunt, you.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.280
Ya fucking beauty.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.589
But, Dad...

26:32.680 --> 26:33.750
That's right, son.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.590
I'm home.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.750
But what are you gonna do?

26:38.200 --> 26:41.079
I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass watching
fucking telly all day. That's for sure.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.038
- Frank, what if...
- No, no, listen.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.114
You and me, son. You and me.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.275
We're gonna go out there
and do a bit of business together.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.920
I've enrolled in college, Dad.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.034
- What?
- I'm doing a diploma in hotel management.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.876
Good one. Fucking... Fucking had us there.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.630
Seriously, son, you and me, you and me.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.030
That's it.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.274
Look at him, June. Look at our boy.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.792
He cannot fucking wait.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.230
Fuck!

27:27.080 --> 27:28.434
Never mind, Frank.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.078
It's just great to have you back.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.190
I'm getting builders.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.035
Look.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.351
These are partitions. Eight rooms.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.272
Sixteen girls. Two shifts.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.998
We could be turning over £10,000 a week
every week of the year.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.759
- So, where's my office?
- What?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.357
I'll need an office
if I am to be Madame Veronika.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.315
All right.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.150
Your office...

28:22.600 --> 28:24.000
Is there.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.480
You have money for all this?

28:26.120 --> 28:30.080
I'm gonna find the money
and I'm gonna do this for you.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.640
But when, Simon?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.117
I cannot live on a promise.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.715
Soon.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.314
I promise.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.515
Come on, Spud!

29:11.000 --> 29:12.514
I'm with you, Mark. Go on, Mark.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.758
Almost halfway, Spud. Come on.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.196
Thanks, brother.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.876
Can't fail again, Mark.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.111
You know, I need to detox the system.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.237
Spud. "Detox the system."

29:44.320 --> 29:47.119
What does that even mean?
It doesn't mean anything.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.793
It's not getting it out of your body
that's the problem.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.156
It's getting it out of your mind.
You are an addict.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.836
You think I haven't heard that
100,000 times, Mark?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.673
You got 12 more steps for me, comrade?

29:56.760 --> 29:59.320
So be addicted.
Be addicted to something else.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.959
Like running until I feel sick?

30:01.040 --> 30:02.269
Yes.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.874
Or something else.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.158
You've got to channel it.
You've got to control it.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.674
People try all sorts.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.353
Some people do boxing.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.909
- Boxing?
- Well, it's just an example.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.071
I don't... I don't mean you should...

30:16.720 --> 30:18.598
So, what did you channel it into?

30:20.800 --> 30:22.075
Getting away.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.195
Do you remember, Mark...
You remember that girl, Sharron?

30:33.160 --> 30:34.879
Lived in Granton.

30:34.960 --> 30:35.996
Tall.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.232
- Well, taller than us anyway, at the time.
- Yeah, I remember her.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.918
Your very first sexual encounter.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.438
- Right.
- Mine too.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.870
Okay.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.679
You remember shoplifting
in Woolworths together

30:48.080 --> 30:49.753
and you got caught, you gave my name?

30:49.920 --> 30:52.116
- Yeah.
- How about this one?

30:52.200 --> 30:54.556
Warm day, sunny afternoon.

30:55.760 --> 31:00.596
Two young lads, and we clubbed together
and bought our very first hit off Swanney.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.915
Our very first bag of heroin.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.514
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.720
- Swanney's dead now, of course.
- Be astonished if he wasn't.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.759
And we went down that park,
back of Banana Flats.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.832
- Dog shit park.
- Yeah.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.640
And we shared a needle.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.114
Shared a needle, yeah.

31:18.760 --> 31:19.955
You went first.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.797
Your blood runs in my veins, Mark.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.914
Would you stop looking at your fucking watch?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.469
- I have a flight to catch.
- Shit.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.160
Excuse me a moment.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.840
Fuck.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.839
Fuck!

31:43.000 --> 31:44.673
So you're Plan B.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.956
Yes.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.199
I am to persuade you to stay and help him.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.870
It will mean so much to have
his oldest friend by his side

31:57.960 --> 32:00.316
in this exciting new business opportunity.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.116
He told you to say that.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.510
Yes.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.078
Did he choose your dress?

32:06.200 --> 32:07.270
No.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.397
- You like it?
- It's very nice.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.755
Is he taking cocaine in there?

32:12.360 --> 32:13.510
Probably.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.078
Is he doing that a lot?

32:16.920 --> 32:18.479
As often as he can.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.153
- Where is he?
- Gone.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.119
Gone? How could you let him go?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.355
Simon.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.710
Simon!

32:38.800 --> 32:40.632
How could you let him go?

32:40.720 --> 32:43.360
I'm not finished yet.
I'm not finished with him!

32:47.840 --> 32:49.957
The fuck are you staring at?

32:50.480 --> 32:52.915
Cunt robbed me of £16,000.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.833
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,

33:08.920 --> 33:12.391
and welcome to Jet2.com
Flight 0511 to Amsterdam.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.595
I'm getting divorced.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.317
You just came back to tell me that?

33:51.400 --> 33:54.791
Of course, any misfortune which befalls you
is music to my ears.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.792
I was supposed to go back
and move my stuff out.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.950
She owns the apartment.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.237
- And the children?
- There aren't any.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.960
- None?
- No.

34:04.600 --> 34:09.038
So when you said wife, two kids...
James and...

34:09.120 --> 34:11.429
- Laura.
- Laura, that wasn't strictly true?

34:11.520 --> 34:13.193
- No.
- Why'd you lie to me?

34:13.440 --> 34:15.159
'Cause I didn't want to tell you the truth.

34:17.560 --> 34:21.315
And the no-kids thing, was...
Was that a problem?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.630
It's none of your business.

34:24.639 --> 34:27.792
Yes, it was a problem.
It was a fucking big problem.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.270
- All right? That make you happy?
- A little bit.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.675
Oh, fuck off.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.235
It's all over, the marriage. Fifteen years.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.275
And then the company I work for,
that's merging with another.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.476
There'll be no room for me.
Not enough qualifications.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.998
I can see that coming.
I don't need to wait for the fucking letter.

34:45.639 --> 34:49.600
And then three months ago,
I suffered what I've been told was a...

34:49.679 --> 34:52.752
An episode of acute coronary insufficiency.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.909
Like a heart attack.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.869
They put a tube in here.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.278
And I've got a metal stent
in my left coronary artery.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.477
Good as new, apparently. Good as new.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.631
Should last another 30 years, they said,

35:04.720 --> 35:07.394
but they didn't say what to do
with those 30 years.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.393
Two or three, fine, I'll take that.
I can cope with that.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.551
I can think of enough things to do
to piss away what remains.

35:12.680 --> 35:16.230
But 30? What am I supposed to do with that?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.630
I'm 46 and I'm fucked!

35:19.160 --> 35:21.880
I've got no home.
I've got nowhere that I think of as a home.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.713
I don't really know anyone.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.871
And what's the substance of our acquaintance?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.110
Friendship, please.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.471
You ask me to get involved
in some stupid scheme

35:30.560 --> 35:33.553
to finance and establish and run a brothel.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.869
Sauna, please.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.758
- A brothel.
- Well...

35:37.400 --> 35:40.393
The sad thing is...
The most pathetic thing of all

35:40.480 --> 35:43.075
is that I can't think of anything better.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.674
So you're gonna help me? Find the money?

35:48.760 --> 35:51.229
- Where's Veronika?
- She's not here.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.636
She doesn't really like staying over.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.316
She complains that it's a mess,
all that sort of thing.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.073
- Does she?
- Yeah.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.240
- Not why you stayed, is it?
- What?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.751
- Her, Veronika.
- No, of course not.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.115
No? 'Cause she's my girlfriend.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.714
- Yeah, I know that.
- Good.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.038
- It's not a mess, is it?
- No. It's just masculine.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.115
What is this?

36:31.120 --> 36:32.349
Come here.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.840
Just do exactly what I told you.
You'll be fine.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.434
Grab anything you can carry.
Get the telly at the end.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.070
Go!

36:58.200 --> 36:59.919
- There?
- Shut up.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.274
- Fuck's sake!
- I'm sorry.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.676
Who's there?

37:15.520 --> 37:16.636
Hello?

37:16.840 --> 37:19.355
What the fuck's going on down here?

37:31.040 --> 37:32.235
What the fuck?

37:32.680 --> 37:34.637
- I'm sorry.
- Cunt!

37:48.280 --> 37:51.432
Ya cunt, you! You fucking beauty, you!

37:53.840 --> 37:54.910
How you doing, Mikey?

37:57.360 --> 37:58.874
Hey. Bring in the telly.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.680
Who's this, then?

38:00.760 --> 38:04.276
This big handsome bastard
is none other than my son.

38:04.360 --> 38:07.034
Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.592
- So you're teaching him the trade?
- He's a little bit to learn though, eh?

38:10.680 --> 38:12.160
Well, you're in the right hands, son.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.119
He's got the talent, I'll tell you that.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.316
We had a spot of bother.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.359
Concerned citizen came down the stairs,
fucking tooled up and all.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.999
I was on the back foot, I can tell you.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.154
But Franco Junior here
took him out and no mistake.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.913
Well, no, it wasn't quite like that.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.151
Takes after his old man, eh?

38:28.560 --> 38:29.550
Don't you?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.836
- Cheers, boys.
- See you again.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.240
I covered up for you there.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.750
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- See, if that happens again,

38:40.840 --> 38:43.435
son or no son,
it's gonna be a fucking kicking, right?

38:43.520 --> 38:44.749
Right, Dad.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.630
Right. Come on.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.640
Never mind, Frank.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.353
Oh, fucking shut up.

39:15.880 --> 39:19.032
A light had shone in the night

39:19.120 --> 39:21.919
Somewhere ahead

39:24.080 --> 39:27.437
And blue had turned into green

39:27.520 --> 39:29.432
Then it was red...

39:30.280 --> 39:33.193
This place is a goldmine. It's a certainty.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.557
I mean, these are people who've been
abandoned by their political class.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.117
But at least they have what we don't...
A sense of identity.

39:40.720 --> 39:41.949
Right, come on, let's get it over with.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.555
An identity encapsulated in four digits.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.235
If we're not back in an hour,
call the police.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.391
- What shall I say?
- Just tell them we're dead.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.758
Each machine seemed to say

39:52.840 --> 39:57.437
As I walked round and round the penny arcade

39:57.520 --> 40:00.558
And just ring the bell
on the big bagatelle...

40:00.640 --> 40:03.872
The Battle of the Boyne
was fought on the 11th of July, 1690,

40:03.960 --> 40:07.556
between two rival claimants of
the British and Irish thrones,

40:07.680 --> 40:09.478
James ll, Catholic,

40:09.600 --> 40:11.592
and William of Orange, Protestant.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.318
The battle was decisive. The Protestants won.

40:17.280 --> 40:21.718
But 400 years later,
the uncompromising and victorious loyalists

40:21.800 --> 40:25.680
now feel estranged from the
modern, secular United Kingdom.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.436
Let me tell you that I love you

40:29.560 --> 40:32.917
And I think about you all the time

40:33.600 --> 40:35.990
The sectarian songs have been banned,

40:36.280 --> 40:40.274
but they still gather
and remain loyal to the victory of 1690,

40:40.360 --> 40:42.670
and to a simpler, less tolerant time.

40:42.920 --> 40:48.359
It's the greatest sight that I have ever seen

40:51.400 --> 40:53.357
You are a red hot

40:54.000 --> 40:56.276
You're a red hot dancer

40:56.360 --> 41:00.274
When you swing your hips
And you do the salsa

41:00.400 --> 41:04.314
Rock forward and back
Then you do it again

41:04.400 --> 41:07.040
Take a grapevine to the right...

41:07.120 --> 41:10.238
But if nothing else,
history has shown us very clearly

41:10.320 --> 41:13.074
these are people
whom it is unwise to provoke.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.511
You aren't from 'round here, are you, lads?

41:18.560 --> 41:21.075
You not gonna give us a song?

41:25.080 --> 41:27.311
I can sing. I'll just...
I'll just fucking make something up.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.516
You can play the piano.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.080
I can't play the fucking piano.

41:30.160 --> 41:31.310
You know those two chords.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.756
The fucking F and G march
you used to play at school.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.830
Do that.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.150
Good evening.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.119
My mate and I would like to

41:44.760 --> 41:46.353
sing a song that we wrote.

41:47.800 --> 41:48.950
No.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.957
Is... Is that it?

41:59.120 --> 42:03.000
It was the year of 1690

42:05.720 --> 42:08.872
On the 11th of July

42:10.800 --> 42:14.714
Or the first in Julian calendar

42:14.800 --> 42:15.916
Wait, wait, wait.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.954
Give me something
with a little bit of rhythm.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.670
Here we go.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.190
It was on the field of battle

42:34.160 --> 42:36.277
Of hope we were bereft

42:36.360 --> 42:39.034
But by the time that it was over

42:42.320 --> 42:44.835
There were no more Catholics left

43:00.720 --> 43:02.757
We looked up to King William

43:02.840 --> 43:04.752
On his chin a royal cleft

43:04.840 --> 43:09.437
And by the time that it was over
There were no more Catholics left

43:11.280 --> 43:12.680
Aye! Fucking right.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.437
His strategy was strong
His strategy was deft

43:20.520 --> 43:25.231
By the time that it was over
There were no more Catholics left

43:28.520 --> 43:32.275
The battle now victorious
We foiled his papist theft

43:32.360 --> 43:36.639
When the time was over
There were no more Catholics left

43:37.760 --> 43:39.274
Aye!

43:39.920 --> 43:47.032
No more Catholics

43:47.280 --> 43:54.357
No more Catholics

43:54.440 --> 44:03.679
- No more
- No more

44:03.760 --> 44:06.992
No more Catholics left

44:10.880 --> 44:12.599
Thank you very much. Good night.

44:21.160 --> 44:22.230
Just fucking drive.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.715
One-six-nine-zero.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.040
One-six-nine-zero.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.319
Sixteen-ninety.

44:39.960 --> 44:40.996
- Nope.
- Nope.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.474
And it's midnight.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.630
Start again.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.517
So, there's this room service guy, right?

44:56.600 --> 44:58.512
And he comes into the room,
and there is Georgie Best

44:58.640 --> 45:00.836
lying on the bed with two Playboy models.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.037
Three in a bed, champagne
and a little bit of Charlie,

45:03.120 --> 45:04.759
and there's banknotes.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.718
But they're lying on the banknotes.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.029
- Lying on the money?
- Yes.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.190
- Why?
- I don't know.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.270
Because he has a lot of money.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.596
Or at least he had
a lot of money at the time, anyway.

45:12.680 --> 45:14.876
The room service guy, he comes in,

45:14.960 --> 45:16.713
and he sees this scene
that I just described to you,

45:16.800 --> 45:18.029
and he says, "George Best..."

45:18.160 --> 45:20.038
Greatest footballer of all time.

45:20.160 --> 45:22.675
Exactly. "The greatest footballer
of all time, I have to ask you,

45:23.000 --> 45:24.593
"'Where did it all go wrong?'"

45:27.200 --> 45:29.715
Where did it all go wrong?

45:29.800 --> 45:32.554
- Where did it all go wrong, George Best?
- Yeah, but...

45:32.640 --> 45:37.271
I think that the room service guy, you know...
I think he makes a very good point.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.870
No?

45:44.160 --> 45:46.231
He played for Hibs in 1979

45:46.320 --> 45:48.755
between stints for
the Fort Lauderdale Strikers

45:48.840 --> 45:50.559
and the San Jose Earthquakes.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.996
I went to see him play, apparently.
My dad took me.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.197
He said, "You've got to see this.
You've got to see this player.

45:55.320 --> 45:57.596
"Got to see this greatest footballer
of all time."

45:57.680 --> 46:01.594
So it was a big game, it was a big crowd,
and a big guy in front of me.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.956
I couldn't see a thing. Not a single thing.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.150
Not for 90 minutes.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.999
But I've got the programme, so...

46:07.080 --> 46:08.514
I mean, I've always got that, you know?

46:08.800 --> 46:10.917
Thin. Thin. Nobody was fat back then.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.434
It's not just the football, is it?

46:12.520 --> 46:14.398
- It's the end of austerity.
- There was no such thing even

46:14.480 --> 46:16.358
- as a calorie till 1974.
- Welcome to the new age of

46:16.440 --> 46:18.557
- civil rights, space exploration.
- You know what happened in 1974?

46:18.640 --> 46:19.630
The first McDonald's in the UK.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.830
He's basically John Barry
with football boots.

46:20.920 --> 46:22.957
See, look at that guy.
He would be scrawny today.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.599
A great, swaggering, filthy piece of music.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.195
- But then... That was totally normal till 1974.
- It's insurrection!

46:27.280 --> 46:29.476
- That's the beauty of what he does.
- You know what happened in 1974?

46:29.560 --> 46:30.914
First McDonald's. South London. Woolwich.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.673
These are not goals.
These are political statements.

46:32.760 --> 46:34.399
It's still there.
I've been there myself several times.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.199
You know nothing. You understand nothing.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.040
You live in the past.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.033
Where I come from

46:41.120 --> 46:43.271
the past is something to forget

46:43.360 --> 46:45.272
but here it's all you talk about.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.153
You are clearly so in love with each other

46:48.240 --> 46:50.675
that I feel awkward in your company.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.679
Instead of looking at me

46:52.760 --> 46:54.240
you should get naked and fuck each other.

46:55.720 --> 46:56.676
Cheers.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.314
- Up your ass.
- Placebo.

46:59.480 --> 47:01.073
- There's a fucking...
- Do it. Let's do it.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.039
Fuck off.

47:37.400 --> 47:39.278
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

48:41.960 --> 48:43.076
Jab.

48:43.640 --> 48:44.869
Double jab.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.754
Double jab, right hand.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.400
One, two.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.390
Junior. You coming, for fuck's sake?

50:46.480 --> 50:48.711
- Frank.
- What? What is it now?

50:48.800 --> 50:50.917
- The boy.
- What about him?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.799
See, Frank, please don't be angry.
It's just, he's not really...

50:54.240 --> 50:55.469
"Not really," what?

50:59.880 --> 51:01.075
Sorry, Dad.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.195
The fuck is that?

51:03.280 --> 51:05.397
You cannot go with me dressed like that.

51:05.480 --> 51:08.996
See, I don't really think,
you know, I'm into it.

51:09.480 --> 51:12.234
- He doesn't want to go, Frank.
- Doesn't want to go?

51:12.320 --> 51:14.277
Where else you gonna go?

51:14.680 --> 51:18.356
I was actually gonna go
and meet some friends from the college.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.839
From the college, is it?

51:21.720 --> 51:23.074
Right.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.592
Well, that's a blow and no mistake,
no two ways about that.

51:25.680 --> 51:26.670
Sorry, Dad.

51:26.760 --> 51:27.910
Some way to treat your old man.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.754
- Please, Frank.
- You shut the fuck up!

51:30.840 --> 51:33.435
Hotel fucking management.
You put him up to this.

51:33.520 --> 51:34.636
Dad, it's not like that.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.712
Shut the fuck up! "Dad."

51:38.760 --> 51:40.353
Maybe I'm not your dad.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.114
- I see it now.
- No, Frank.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.874
- Dad, leave it.
- "Leave it"? I don't want to fucking leave it!

51:45.960 --> 51:49.920
What if I don't want to fucking leave it?
What you gonna do about that, eh?

51:50.000 --> 51:52.117
Tell you what... Free pop.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.157
- No, Frank!
- Shut it.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.316
Come on.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.073
Stick one on then, you cunt.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.640
Take a fucking swipe at me. Do it.

52:01.720 --> 52:02.995
Do it!

52:04.920 --> 52:07.230
No, you cannot fucking do that.

52:08.120 --> 52:11.636
See, if you were my son,
you'd have stabbed us there.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.955
I'd be lying, breathing my last
through a hole in my chest.

52:15.040 --> 52:17.475
But you cannot fucking do that.

52:50.440 --> 52:51.920
What do you want?

53:05.680 --> 53:07.751
- Yep.
- Mark.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.320
What?

53:09.400 --> 53:10.629
Need a lawyer.

53:11.560 --> 53:15.315
So, as I understand it,
the complainant, a deputy headmaster,

53:15.400 --> 53:19.155
alleges that he's been
the victim of attempted extortion.

53:19.240 --> 53:20.833
How does Sick Boy intend to plead?

53:20.920 --> 53:23.151
It's actually "Simon" these days.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.391
Right. Simon.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.077
I see. Not guilty.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.276
Fine.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.036
Off the record,

53:33.120 --> 53:36.557
the police have told me that the USB drive
does have Simon's prints on it

53:36.640 --> 53:38.040
and that in searching the flat,

53:38.120 --> 53:40.316
they found the mobile
that the bank details were sent from.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.116
Right.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.873
As well as the cocaine, of course.

53:44.960 --> 53:47.191
Well, that was just for personal use.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.600
Quite a lot for personal use.

53:48.680 --> 53:49.670
Well, you know Simon.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.152
I certainly remember him.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.075
- Does he still take heroin?
- No.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.514
Do you?

53:57.880 --> 53:59.872
No. Not for 20 years.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.310
That's really good.

54:02.920 --> 54:04.149
Well done.

54:06.680 --> 54:09.718
So, are you the woman in the video?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.435
My face is not seen.

54:11.880 --> 54:14.031
Do you have any identifying marks?

54:14.840 --> 54:16.797
Tattoos on your buttocks?

54:17.360 --> 54:18.430
Certainly not.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.716
On your perineum?

54:25.240 --> 54:27.550
It's the bit of skin
between your vagina and your bumhole.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.389
That's disgusting.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.360
So you're not vajazzled.

54:33.040 --> 54:36.716
May I ask,
what is your relationship with the accused?

54:38.040 --> 54:39.030
We are friends.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.310
Mark?

54:44.360 --> 54:46.920
I really don't have anything else to add.

54:48.920 --> 54:49.910
Well...

54:50.280 --> 54:52.192
Perhaps we have a defence.

54:52.840 --> 54:56.151
Simon may claim that
the recording was consensual,

54:56.240 --> 54:58.630
was, in fact,
commissioned by the complainant.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.439
Hence the request for payment.

55:00.520 --> 55:04.196
He pleads guilty on the cocaine,
which, remarkably, is a first offence,

55:04.280 --> 55:09.071
enters into an approved rehab,
£1,000 fine, six months suspended.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.560
This consultation is free.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.599
Should we go forward, here's the cost.

55:14.160 --> 55:15.389
Well, that's very reasonable.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.435
It's an hourly rate.

55:20.240 --> 55:21.230
'Course.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.080
Thanks.

55:25.760 --> 55:26.910
Mark.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.077
She's too young for you.

55:43.320 --> 55:46.119
Here it is.
"EU Small Business Development Loans.

55:46.280 --> 55:48.317
"Zero-interest loans distributed regionally

55:48.440 --> 55:52.798
"towards projects that stimulate regeneration
of formerly industrial areas.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.038
"Loans are available of up to £100,000.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.952
"Applications should be made online,

55:58.040 --> 56:00.794
"which may be followed by an invitation
to present a business plan."

56:00.880 --> 56:02.280
Blah, blah, fucking blah.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.080
I'm trying to help you, Simon.

56:04.160 --> 56:06.311
We're blowing all that
cashpoint money on lawyer's fees.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.039
You could've got someone cheaper.

56:08.120 --> 56:11.955
Well, I wouldn't have had to get anyone at all
if you hadn't engaged in fucking blackmail.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.637
Is there anything left of your £4,000
I gave you?

56:14.720 --> 56:16.518
No, I've got expenses,
just like everyone else.

56:16.600 --> 56:18.080
What, all of it?

56:18.160 --> 56:20.311
You snorted the whole fucking wad?

56:20.400 --> 56:22.710
It's called debt, Mark.

56:22.800 --> 56:26.396
The point is, we need cash now,
not in six months' time.

56:26.480 --> 56:28.233
And you realise what's at stake here?

56:28.320 --> 56:30.437
I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.

56:30.520 --> 56:33.080
And if I don't get it up and running soon,
she's gonna leave me.

56:33.440 --> 56:35.636
- Fucking leave you anyway.
- No, it's not gonna happen.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.189
- Is she actually even with you?
- She's my girlfriend.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.634
You've never even fucked her.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.552
I have fucked her, and I'll fuck her again.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.109
- What? When she was working at the sauna?
- That's not fair.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.073
You know, since we're having
this conversation,

56:46.160 --> 56:49.597
I can tell you that fully consensual,
emotionally driven, not-for-profit

56:49.680 --> 56:51.433
sexual intercourse has been attained.

56:51.680 --> 56:52.875
Simon, you're a romantic.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.759
Veronika and I have had our rough patches.
I'll be the first to admit that.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.433
Shall we submit this application?

56:57.520 --> 56:59.910
Do what you want,
but I need someone on-site working.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.354
I need progress.

57:01.760 --> 57:02.830
Now.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.150
All right, Spud, we're upstairs.

57:05.280 --> 57:07.317
- All right, Mark.
- Come in.

57:08.960 --> 57:13.193
When clients come in,
I want a sense of space.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.716
Yeah.

57:14.800 --> 57:19.511
Maybe some soft lighting, help punters feel
a bit more relaxed and that, you know?

57:19.600 --> 57:23.150
Exactly. I'm so glad
that someone understands.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.673
And they're off and racing.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.832
Woody Bay was a little awkward
out of the stalls and also to gather stride.

57:34.920 --> 57:38.960
Out well towards the right,
Fine 'n' Dandy is racing solo early on.

57:39.040 --> 57:42.397
Steventon Star down the centre
with Jacob's Pillow.

57:55.400 --> 57:56.436
Hello, Franco.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.634
Simon.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.476
- But you're not...
- I'm out.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.551
- "Out"?
- Aye. Fucking shut up.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.800
Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked
to see you, Frank. It's just...

58:25.080 --> 58:26.275
Well, I was gonna...

58:26.400 --> 58:29.199
I was gonna deal with this myself
and then give you the good news, but...

58:30.120 --> 58:31.634
You're not gonna believe this.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.436
So, two days ago,
I got a call from an old friend of mine.

58:34.520 --> 58:36.318
Gav Temperly. You remember him?

58:36.400 --> 58:37.516
Aye.

58:42.760 --> 58:43.796
Anyway.

58:43.920 --> 58:46.389
He's on business in Amsterdam.

58:46.480 --> 58:51.760
And he's in a cafe one morning,
and he hears this voice beside him.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.954
A whiny, cunty voice.

58:55.640 --> 58:56.630
No.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.713
So he turns around, right?

58:58.800 --> 59:01.759
This is two fucking days ago.
I'm just getting over it myself.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.589
- There he is.
- Holy fucking moly.

59:06.680 --> 59:08.194
Hasn't changed in 20 years.

59:08.320 --> 59:11.233
Very same smug, little cunty grin
across his ugly face.

59:11.320 --> 59:13.516
- For fuck's sake!
- Aye, Renton.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.637
Mark fucking Renton.

59:17.800 --> 59:20.679
Living in Amsterdam
all this time on our money.

59:20.760 --> 59:22.911
- Cunt. Did Renton clock him?
- No.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.359
So Gav followed him. He went into an office
block not far from the centre of town.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.591
And Gav had to split then,
but he's gonna go back.

59:28.680 --> 59:31.832
He's gonna hang out,
he's gonna follow Renton home, and then...

59:31.920 --> 59:33.877
- And we're gonna pay him a visit.
- Exactly.

59:34.080 --> 59:36.037
- I need a passport.
- I can get you one.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.236
I'll take some weapons.

59:37.320 --> 59:38.913
Well, we can probably get
weapons there, Franco.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.595
Aye. Probably. They've got
that kind of stuff in Amsterdam, eh?

59:41.680 --> 59:45.879
Aye. Now, the important thing
is for you to keep your head down.

59:46.120 --> 59:49.909
Low profile till the passport comes through,
till I get the tickets.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.550
- 'Cause this is an opportunity, Frank.
- Right.

59:53.640 --> 59:55.438
I'm gonna fucking tear him to pieces.

59:55.520 --> 59:57.352
You most definitely fucking will.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.511
Simon and I do not sleep together.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.677
No? I had wondered.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.954
Once, but... I'm his girlfriend,
but it's business, really.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.679
Simon is not a good person.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.155
But I like him.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.550
More than he likes himself, I think.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.718
Right, but if you're not...

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.110
If there's no physical aspect
to your relationship,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.199
I mean, you don't want to be, like...
You know, wasting your time.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.875
What's "choose life"?

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.311
- What?
- "Choose life."

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.759
Simon says it sometimes.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.794
He says, "Choose life, Veronika."

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.916
"Choose life."

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.231
"Choose life" was a well-meaning slogan
from a 1980s antidrug campaign.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.277
And we used to add things to it.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.238
So I might say, for example, choose...

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.440
Designer lingerie

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.753
in the vain hope of kicking some life
back into a dead relationship.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.910
Choose handbags.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.760
Choose high-heeled shoes.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.556
Cashmere and silk
to make yourself feel what passes for happy.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.871
Choose an iPhone made in China
by a woman who jumped out of a window,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.596
and stick it in the pocket of your jacket
fresh from a South Asian firetrap.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.359
Choose Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.150
and a thousand other ways to spew your bile
across people you've never met.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.038
Choose updating your profile.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.319
Tell the world what you had for breakfast
and hope that someone, somewhere cares.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.637
Choose looking up old flames,

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.155
desperate to believe that
you don't look as bad as they do.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.877
Choose live-blogging
from your first wank to your last breath.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.953
Human interaction reduced
to nothing more than data.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.591
Choose ten things you never knew
about celebrities who'd had surgery.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.353
Choose screaming about abortion.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.512
Choose rape jokes,
slut shaming, revenge porn,

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.910
and an endless tide of depressing misogyny.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.670
Choose 9/11 never happened,
and if it did, it was the Jews.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.039
Choose a zero-hour contract
and a two-hour journey to work,

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.396
and choose the same
for your kids, only worse.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.315
And maybe tell yourself it's better
that they never happened.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.074
And then sit back and smother the pain

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.995
with an unknown dose of an unknown drug
made in somebody's fucking kitchen.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.837
Choose unfulfilled promise
and wishing you'd done it all differently.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.191
Choose never learning from your own mistakes.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.756
Choose watching history repeat itself.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.911
Choose the slow reconciliation

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.199
towards what you can get
rather than what you always hoped for.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.749
Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.672
Choose disappointment.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.194
And choose losing the ones you loved.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.557
And as they fall from view,
a piece of you dies with them.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.190
Until you can see that one day in the future,
piece by piece, they will all be gone.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.592
And there'll be nothing left
of you to call alive or dead.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.194
Choose your future, Veronika.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.074
Choose life.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.715
Anyway, it amused us at the time.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.000
I like you, Mark.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.915
Fuck.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.198
What are you gonna do?

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.235
I'm going to be the madame
in Simon's bordello.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.950
But really...

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.198
What are you gonna do?

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.475
I don't know. I should go home.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.636
But...

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.273
To go home with nothing?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.717
No qualification, no career,
not even bringing money.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.280
What's at home?

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.159
You know.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.311
Emotional attachment.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.750
That's all.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.680
- All set?
- Yeah, fine. You're okay?

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.553
- Aye.
- Sure?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.677
- Why?
- Nothing.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.639
- Why? What's happened?
- No, nothing's happened. I'm just...

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.996
I'm just enjoying us working together.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.480
That's all.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.030
Good. So...

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.476
- Shall we go in? Right.
- Aye.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.790
Jesus.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.072
This is the renovation and conversion
of an iconic Leith building.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.399
We see it very much as being an artisanal
bed-and-breakfast experience.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.278
A destination in its own right.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.719
Artworks by local artists on the walls.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.951
Locally sourced fresh food.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.990
Outreach programmes to inspire children
in school to think outside the box.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.717
To inspire in them a belief that...
Yes, they can.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.760
There was a time when this port
served thousands of ships around the globe.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.240
Now it can rise again.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.313
And we believe our business
will occupy a central role,

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.478
both physically and emotionally,

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.997
at the heart of this new wave
of regeneration in Leith.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.719
Leith 2.1.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.399
Exactly.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.514
We used to steal all this stuff.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.590
Fancy wallpaper.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.478
Sell on to the middle classes and that.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.200
Me and Mark used to steal
all kinds of stuff, actually.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.270
Till we got caught.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.828
He got off. I got six months.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.276
Still, you find out
what you're good at inside.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.113
Signatures... That's what I found out.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.475
Anyone's. If I seen it once, I can do it.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.475
So, when I got out, "Bye-bye, shoplifting.
Hello, chequebook. Hello, cheque card."

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.040
Up to Western Union.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.395
Signature, cash in hand.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.917
Up to Swanney's,
pay off my debts, buy some skag.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.395
I was a portable fucking goldmine.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.710
So, what happened?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.193
Chip and PIN, debit cards, e-banking.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:06.555
Billionaires moving money
at the touch of a button.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.029
There's no room
for an honest artisan like me any more.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.639
So, what did you do?

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.474
Back on the pavement. Seven days a week.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.596
I like your stories.
I think you should write them down.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.076
You think?

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.118
Yeah. Just write them the way you say them.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.510
They're funny. I would like to read them.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.716
Mark and Simon can help.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.393
"Tommy looks well.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.912
"It's terrifying.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.593
"He's gonna die.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.037
"Sometime between the next few weeks
and the next 15 years,

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.679
"Tommy will be no more.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.558
"Chances are that I'll be exactly the same.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.280
"Difference is we know this with Tommy.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.830
"Tommy cannot get out.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.880
"He cannot afford to heat his home,

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.077
"put himself in a bubble,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.356
"live in the warm, eat good fresh food,

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.319
"keep his mind stimulated
with new challenges.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.480
"He will only live five or 10 or 15 years
before he is crushed.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.232
"Tommy will not survive winter
in West Granton."

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.670
Well, I'm trying hard, Mark,
but I'm not feeling anything.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.552
We were young. Bad things happened.
It's over.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.314
Can we go home now?

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.990
- Two hours to the next train.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.000
Look, we're here as an act of memorial.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.073
Nostalgia.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.038
That's why you're here.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.995
You're a tourist in your own youth.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.835
Just 'cause you had a near-death experience,
and now you're feeling all fuzzy and warm.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.114
What other moments will you be revisiting?

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.310
Here's a good one.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.710
How about the time you sold
Tommy his very first hit,

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.515
leading him on to heroin addiction,
HIV infection,

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.997
and ultimately his death at the age of...
What was it, 22, 23?

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.560
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-three.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.953
How innocent was that?

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.999
Aye, that's mine.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.680
How's yours?

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.116
Don't know what you're talking about.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.237
She'd be a woman by now.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.754
Maybe kids of her own.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.477
But she never got that far, did she?

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.755
Never got to lead her life.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.955
Because her father,

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.833
someone who should have been
looking after her,

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.639
protecting his own infant,

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.916
was too busy filling
his own veins with heroin

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.117
to check that she was breathing properly.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.995
How do you keep a lid on that one?

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.277
Well, that's that, then.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.350
Here we go.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.120
Fuck's sake.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.031
- All right, doll.
- Thanks.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.554
Looking good, baby.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.756
Not bad yourself, daddy-o.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.194
Why, bring it over here.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.509
Really?

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.120
I'm not wearing any knickers.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.793
For fuck's sake.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.558
Well, tell you what... Just away for a piss.
Back in a moment.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.676
We'll see what's happening, okay?

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.910
- All right, then.
- Aye.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.559
Deal. Done.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.434
Hi. I can't take your call,
so please leave a message.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.670
Fuck.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.594
What's all this, then?

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.592
Planning a special event, are we, sir?

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.034
Just give us the tablets, pal.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.952
Remember not to exceed the stated dose.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.190
Just give us the fucking tablets

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.391
before I come through there
and pound your fucking head in.

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.676
Aye, all right. Fucking calm down.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.432
- Fuck's sake.
- Cunt.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.670
Prick.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.080
Cunt!

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.394
Fuck. Fuck.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.036
Rent Boy, where... Mark?

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.757
Go! Go, go, go!

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.630
Fuck!

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.797
Go on, then, you fucking cunt, you!

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.110
Fuck.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.313
Go! Would you fucking go?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.320
Fuck it!

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.630
Fuck.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.475
I didn't know.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.634
Okay, okay.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.871
I might've heard something.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.189
You might've heard something?

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.351
All right, fuck it. I knew.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.111
I knew, and I could have served you up
to him on a plate any time I wanted to.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.391
I bet you were fucking
looking forward to it, too, weren't you?

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.598
Yeah, yeah, I was.
I was looking forward to it.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.880
I ought to fucking kill you.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.920
Fuck is this?

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.150
Get in.

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.000
It's Mark and Simon, right?

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.794
Do you know who I am?

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.550
Good.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.239
So you know that I own a couple of saunas
in the north of Edinburgh.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.115
In fact, you boys should know,
I own all the saunas in Edinburgh.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.431
So your venture
was never gonna happen, was it?

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.796
I couldn't have you on my doorstep

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.599
in competition for my members of staff,
for my clientele.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.080
It was never gonna happen, Simon, was it?

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.470
- No, Mr Doyle.
- Right answer.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.029
I wouldn't let it happen.
And it's not gonna happen, right?

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:23.396
Thankfully for you two,

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:28.831
I've done some due diligence on you,
and what I hear is you're a couple of losers.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.200
Two absolute losers.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.920
- How's that sound, Simon?
- Yeah, yeah, that's probably right enough.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.834
Aye. "Probably right enough." Right answer.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.835
Take your clothes off.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.675
All of them.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.710
Fuck's sake.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.758
"Probably right enough, Mr Doyle."

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.799
If you grovelled a bit more,
we might not be going home in the buff.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.075
At least I have my dignity.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.356
Is that what you're calling it?

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.715
Are you ready?

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.234
- No.
- Come on.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.390
Hello, boys.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.591
You just delete that right now.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.033
I put it on Twitter. No one will see.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.555
Veronika, don't you understand?
There's not gonna be a sauna.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.552
- Never.
- I know that.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.869
So we lost everything.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.794
- Did you not get the e-mail?
- No, I didn't get a fucking e-mail.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.519
We got the money.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.394
- What?
- How much?

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.358
The money. What do you call it?

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.035
- Small Business Development?
- How much?

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.476
£100,000.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.599
No!

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.796
Yeah!

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.711
First,

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.230
there's an opportunity.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.312
And then,

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.993
there is a betrayal.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.833
Mark stole from me.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.553
His best friend.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.351
So this money is mine.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.757
First,

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.355
there is an opportunity.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.159
And then,

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.754
there is a betrayal.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.117
Simon knew that Francis Begbie was out,
and he chose to keep that a secret.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.593
I owe him nothing.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.833
We owe him nothing.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.391
- All right, Murphy?
- Franco.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.715
Sit down.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.470
Sit down.

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.910
Now...

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.230
So where is he?

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.159
Don't say, "Who?"

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.310
Don't say, "I don't know."

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.432
Just fucking tell me where he is.

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.789
- Still a junkie, Murphy?
- No.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.075
I'm clean now, Frank.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.834
You? Clean? Fucking joke.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.160
What is all this shit anyway?

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.480
It's just, like, stories and that.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.320
"Stories"?

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.680
What are you writing stories for?

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.513
Who's gonna read shit
written by a cunt like you?

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.071
Just thought maybe my grandchildren, or...

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.516
- You got grandchildren?
- No.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.080
What you writing
fucking stories for them for?

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.311
They may not even like stories.
You thought of that?

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.232
No. That's a good point, Franco.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.629
"The sweat was lashing off Sick Boy."

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.751
- Sick... Sick Boy? What, is it about him?
- It's about all of us, like.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.633
- All of you? About me?
- No, not about you.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.915
Fucking better not be.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.951
"Strolling Through the Meadows."

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.390
Here, read it.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.153
- What?
- Read it.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.231
"Strolling Through the Meadows.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.472
"The pubs, like, dead busy.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.600
"It's full o' loco-locals
and festival types."

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.275
'Cause the festival was going on,
see, in the story.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.199
"They're all having a little snort
before heading off to the next show.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.990
"Beg...

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.320
"Beg..."

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.714
I was definitely gonna
cut this bit out, Frank.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.120
Well, fucking read it.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:53.358
"Begbie's pissed his jeans."

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.395
I remember that night.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.956
Read on.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.793
- What?
- Read on. Read on.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.118
"The boy, likes,
just wouldn't hand over the wallet,

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.635
"even when Begbie pulled the knife, like.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.712
"The last words I heard the dude say was,

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.473
"'You won't use that.'

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.918
"Begbie went fucking crazy, got, like, that
carried away with the bladework, you know.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.320
"We nearly forgot the wallet, likes.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.314
"Blood was flowing into the latrine,
mixing with the piss."

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.436
Blood.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.159
Mixing with the piss.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.640
It was an ugly sight, man.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.915
Murphy.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.836
You've got hidden talents, man.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.719
"Then it happens.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.316
"All I did was put a pint
of Export in front of Begbie.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.471
"He takes one fucking gulp out o' it.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.029
"Then he throws the empty glass
from his last pint

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.160
"straight over the balcony
in a casual backhand motion.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.311
"The glass crashes down on this girl's head,

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.631
"which splits open as she falls to her knees.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.396
"Begbie's on his feet and we're racing
down the stairs, and he shouts..."

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.994
"That lady got glassed!

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:04.232
"And no cunt leaves here
till I find out what cunt did it."

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.519
"That lady got glassed.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.359
"And no cunt leaves here
till I find out what cunt did it."

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.600
That is lovely.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.399
What else have you got?

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.596
What's this? What's this?

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.478
London, London.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.440
"Renton had never seen so much money.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:29.037
"He stole the money.
Took it from his friends."

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.351
What? No, that is just a story, that one.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.033
That is just a little story.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.319
"Renton felt no sympathy for Begbie.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.719
"No.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.350
"Renton's real guilt was for Spud.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.234
"He loved Spud.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.993
"Spud had never hurt anybody.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:53.078
"If there was one person
whom Renton would try to compensate,

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.196
"it was Spud."

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.473
"Compensate"?

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.315
I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.149
How much money did he leave you?

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.513
£4,000. Left it in a locker.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.155
Well, you didn't fucking
tell us that at the time.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.160
I'm sorry, Franco.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.391
Don't fucking move.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.991
I did steal the money,
but they shouldn't have been surprised.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.595
I mean, we stole from all sorts of people.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.469
Shops, businesses, neighbours, family.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:47.074
Friends was just one more class of victim.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.792
In the morning,
when you were gone with my money,

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.076
I was furious, but also I thought,

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.153
"'Course he's taken it.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.199
"Why wouldn't he?"

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.549
Daniel?

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.836
It's me.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.160
I'm not here.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.191
- What do you mean, you're not here?
- Go!

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.078
Veronika, you cannot be here. Please.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.352
It's not safe for you, kitten-cat.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.830
- You got to vamoose.
- What happened?

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.195
Tell Mark. Tell Simon.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.192
They need to run quick.
The Beggar is on the loose.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.112
Please, Veronika,
he'll be back at any minute.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.520
Who will be back?

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.154
Well, well, well.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.916
Rescue.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.710
This your bird, Murphy?

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.031
Please, Franco, leave her alone.
She has nothing to do with this.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.193
'Course she hasn't.

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.157
What would she be doing
with an ugly cunt like you?

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.272
What's your name, doll?

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.950
Veronika.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.394
Veronika.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.879
Well, that's lovely.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.312
And how do you know Mr Murphy here?

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.319
- Simon.
- Simon?

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.274
Good old Simon.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:59.155
And what about Simon's very best friend?

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.710
You know him and all?

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.519
You got a phone?

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.397
- A phone?
- Aye. A mobile phone.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.517
You know the kind of thing.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.319
- Yes.
- Give it.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.358
But you have to let us go.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.476
Both of us.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.480
- Another?
- No, I'm fine.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.629
Where are you going?

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.311
You shouldn't be out
in this neck of the woods, kitten-cat.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.437
I have a plan for us.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.715
What?

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.160
"We went for a piss
in the old Leith Central Station.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.233
"Me, Renton and Begbie.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.518
"Place was empty, soon to be demolished."

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.274
Some size o' station this was.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.238
Used to be steam engines
to all over from here.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.993
Choo-fucking-choo!

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.997
"An old drunkard,
whom Begbie had been looking at,

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.833
"lurched up to us, wine bottle in his hand."

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.633
What're you up to, lads, eh?

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.955
Trainspotting?

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.155
In Leith Central?

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.953
"He says, laughing.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:24.759
"I noticed Begbie seemed
strangely subdued and uncomfortable."

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.714
They fucking turn it on for you.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.916
Fucking shitbag!

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.154
"It was only then I realised

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.039
"the old wino was Begbie's father."

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.237
"First, there is an opportunity.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.040
"And then, there's a betrayal."

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.359
And that's how it ends.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.470
That's funny.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.553
That's like everything
I've been writing about.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.349
Yes, Daniel.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.433
But this one...

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.673
Needs an ending too.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.880
June.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.394
Franco Junior.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.718
Can I come in for a moment?

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.194
There's something I have to do tonight,
and then I'm going away.

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:24.354
One way or another, it'll be a long time
before you see me again.

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.035
So I just thought I'd come by.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.958
I just thought I'd come by
and say good luck, son.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.280
That's all.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.756
Thanks, Dad.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.832
See, it's difficult for me, 'cause...

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.389
We never had any of that when I was a boy.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.159
Not, like, hotel...

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.150
Management.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.833
Aye, hotel fucking management, all that shit.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.752
I never had any of that.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.753
Still...

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.191
World changes, eh, June?

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.073
Even if we don't.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.760
So... Look after yourself, son.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.471
The old wino was my father.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.673
This fool is yours.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.355
You'll be a better man than either of us.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.394
What the fuck?

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.800
She's not here.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.720
And seeing as we both are,

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.871
don't imagine she'll turn up any time soon.

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.792
I'm gonna call her.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.233
It's switched off.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.320
So, what are we doing here, then?

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.915
It's her way of saying goodbye, I suppose.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.160
I loved that woman.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.835
Mark! I'm so sorry!
I've done a terrible thing!

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.240
- Fuck are you doing here?
- Lock the doors!

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.192
Sorry about what?

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.835
Lock it!

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.071
- Sorry for what?
- Get upstairs now!

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.356
We have to get to fuck now!

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.592
- Mark! I've done a terrible thing!
- What?

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.796
- Franco!
- What?

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.678
Veronika! Gail!

01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.633
Little Fergus. Well, he's not
so little any more.

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.791
You seen him recently? He's really shot up...

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.752
What the fuck are you talking about, Murphy?

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.360
Aye, carry on, Spud.

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.678
Finish your story.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.520
'Cause we're all dying to hear it.

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.034
Well, it's like the lady says.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.720
Betrayal.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.800
No.

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.954
No, first, there is an opportunity, right?

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.000
And then... Then there is a betrayal.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.799
We've all heard that one before, eh, Mark?

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.315
- Aye, maybe.
- Aye, fucking maybe.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:46.599
Aye, well, like you said,
20 years has just flown by, eh?

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.875
And here we all are.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.394
Boys got lucky again.

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.078
Bit of money again.

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.197
With a... With a...

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.158
with a fucking whore from Bulgaria.

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.074
So...

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.434
How does it end?

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.080
- In a box, Franco.
- That's right.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.238
We're all in a box.

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.953
Just waiting for the lid to come down.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.760
- Frank, come on.
- You knew.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.271
Stringing me along, so you were.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.352
Honestly, mate...

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.274
Fucking deal with you later.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.714
Now...

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.510
Rent Boy.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.120
You and me.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.353
You know, I killed a man once.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:40.354
A man who'd done nothing to me.

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:43.791
Cunt just looked at me the wrong way

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.600
in a moment when I was thinking of you.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.634
I've been thinking about you for 20 year.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.432
When you robbed us.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.753
Your best mates.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.872
Never got my money back.

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.032
Never got my hope back.

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.679
I always promised myself that one day...

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.395
Come on, Rent Boy.

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.711
Not like you to be so shy.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.880
I remember

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:25.154
my first day at primary school.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.720
My very first day.

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.636
And the teacher, she said,

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:37.239
"Good morning, Mark.
You can sit here, next to Francis."

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.240
Remember that, Franco?

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.913
You were older. You'd been kept back.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.434
I remember that well enough.

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.434
Aye.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.397
Had it all before us, didn't we?

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.440
Had it all still to come.

01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.999
And now here we are.

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.754
Aye. You've done all right.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.151
World's all right for smart cunts,
but what about me?

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.317
What about fucking men like me?
What do I get?

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.278
All I can take with my bare hands.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.874
All I can get with my fists.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.953
Is that what I fucking get?

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.596
Who's the fucking smart cunt now?

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.074
Fuck.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.313
Aye. Here we fucking are.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.520
Come on.

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:29.910
Come on, Mark.

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.714
Come on.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:04.720
Here. Come on.

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.150
Franco!

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.998
"So she puts it to Spud..."

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.640
It will be safe if you leave with me.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.917
No, I'm like one of the last
indigenous guys around here.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.200
I cannot go anywhere.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.680
"He says, clinging to the hope

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:25.480
"that he won't commit
this crime against his friends.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.310
"And she says..."

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.198
I'll send you your share.

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:33.320
That doesn't work for me, Veronika.
I'll just blow it all on smack.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.313
All right.

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.392
I'll send it to Gail, then.

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.359
And little Fergus.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.751
"Gail, little Fergus.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:48.400
"A chance to see them smile again.

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.592
"He takes the pen.

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:57.070
"And with his gift of forgery,
so lately underused,

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.753
"he signs their names.

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.436
"Simon Williamson. Mark Renton.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.431
"He transfers the full £100,000

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:09.831
"to the bank account of
Veronika Kovach in Bulgaria."

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.754
Thank you, Daniel.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.753
Spud. Most folks call me Spud.

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.236
Fuck.

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.317
He's doing what?

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.710
- Writing them down.
- Really?

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.951
That's what he told me.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.960
- Murphy?
- Apparently so.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.679
So, who's gonna read 'em?

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.195
Well, that's the problem. Nobody.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.718
I thought of a title.
