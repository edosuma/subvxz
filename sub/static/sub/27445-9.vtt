00:13.274 --> 00:16.451
FXX presentsYou're the Worst.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.138
Oh!

01:04.325 --> 01:09.156
Ah, it is so nice
to finally have a day off.

01:09.199 --> 01:12.333
-It's Sunday.
-Paul F. Tompkins doesn't
believe in Sundays.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.813
Or doctors appointments
or bathroom breaks.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.338
Well, since you have
all this free time,

01:17.381 --> 01:19.166
-have you finally
read my script?
-Oh!

01:19.209 --> 01:22.125
Shoot! I'm sorry, Jimmy. I did.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.127
And I... loved it.

01:24.171 --> 01:27.826
You captured the book perfectly.No notes.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.394
No notes?

01:30.438 --> 01:32.831
No... notes?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.485
Thank you, Edgar.

01:34.529 --> 01:37.358
Well, I shall just send it in
as is, then.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.535
-Final draft, incoming.
- Say, Edgar?

01:40.578 --> 01:42.711
Why, yes, Lindsay?
-You know what I miss?

01:42.754 --> 01:45.366
Handwritten letters? Landlines?Light brown M&M's?

01:45.409 --> 01:48.630
Sunday Funday. Remember that?

01:48.673 --> 01:50.980
I sure do, Lindsay!

01:51.023 --> 01:53.809
-What... is this?

01:53.852 --> 01:57.160
It looks like
a Sunday Funday list.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.988
Nope, we're not doing
Sunday Funday.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.643
We retired it, remember?

02:01.686 --> 02:04.254
: That's too bad,
because it's...

03:16.544 --> 03:18.894
So honored to be included,
you guys.

03:18.937 --> 03:22.071
Gonna crush it.
You'll see... basically.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.378
-Where are all my real friends?-Which friends?

03:24.421 --> 03:25.814
How am I supposed to get buck

03:25.857 --> 03:27.903
with my future
ball-and-chain here?

03:27.946 --> 03:29.252
-Yeah!
-EDGAR: Check out

03:29.296 --> 03:32.081
all the amazing stuff
we have planned.

03:32.124 --> 03:35.911
First, the oldest tiki bar
in the San Fernando Valley.

03:35.954 --> 03:39.306
We'll then hop over
to crazy Topanga Canyon

03:39.349 --> 03:41.308
where real-life hippies will
teach us to throw pottery.

03:41.351 --> 03:47.270
Then, a coastal sundown drive
along the water.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.403
It's gonna be hardcore.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.883
-More like hard-snore.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.885
The only way to make this
impending disaster

03:53.929 --> 03:56.845
remotely fun now is
to immediately get hammered

03:56.888 --> 03:59.413
and enjoy what an utter failureEdgar and Lindsay

03:59.456 --> 04:02.459
-once again prove to be.
-Where the hell is
all the booze?

04:02.503 --> 04:06.507
I had the privilegeof crafting a special microbrew

04:06.550 --> 04:08.552
to commemorate the event.

04:08.596 --> 04:12.861
Introducing the Jimmy
and Gretchen... Strawberry...

04:12.904 --> 04:16.473
-Huh? Pale Ale!

04:16.517 --> 04:18.519
What a laugh.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.999
So jolly.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.393
This is going to be fun,
trust us.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.879
Paul aboard!

04:45.807 --> 04:49.332
Hello, everybody. Hi.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.466
As we get closer to Jimmy
and Gretchen's big day,

04:52.509 --> 04:57.558
I just want to say how much
I look forward to being firmly

04:57.601 --> 05:00.474
involved in their lives,
then even more than now.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.607
I'm gonna be there
is all I'm saying.

05:03.651 --> 05:08.220
And now a song to get
this party started!

05:08.264 --> 05:10.135
-Just wait.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.921
Quickly, just right
after this, but quickly.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.488
-I just have a quick... -

05:14.531 --> 05:16.620
Hello, everyone! Hi!

05:16.664 --> 05:21.190
Hi.
I have a huge announcement.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.974
-EDGAR: English.
-Is everyone looking at me?

05:23.018 --> 05:26.413
-English.
-Shut up, back there! Okay.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.589
-Drumroll.

05:28.632 --> 05:32.636
I'm going to have another baby!

05:32.680 --> 05:34.595
What? What?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.248
Becca! Becca!

05:36.292 --> 05:38.599
-Becca!
-Seriously?
Hey, nerd, it worked!

05:38.642 --> 05:42.646
Oh, my. Huzzah! Huzzah!

05:44.648 --> 05:47.259
-MAN: Shut up, jerk!
-Oh, sorry. Sorry.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.523
Hell yeah! What a miracle.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.742
-Little baby growing in there.
-Yeah.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.571
Gosh, can you believe
it's not just come anymore?

06:00.011 --> 06:03.537
-Me? A papa.

06:03.580 --> 06:06.017
What responsibility.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.459
One more of these
ultra-low-ABV bad boys,

06:12.502 --> 06:15.505
and I'm liable
to tell you a little secret.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.986
-Uh, no.-Are you sure? It's quite juicy.

06:18.029 --> 06:21.076
Paul, I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.817
: Oh!
That sounds like a challenge.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.820
But you have to swear
not to tell anyone.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.475
If you do,
you'll owe me $1,000.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.693
Okay, fine. Deal.

06:29.737 --> 06:33.784
Just tell me so I can be out
of this horrible conversation.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.439
I impregnated Becca.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.268
Direct deposit method.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.444
With my member.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.146
-Well, that is a good secret.
-I told you.

06:53.195 --> 06:56.111
Oh, bother. Oh.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.592
Hi, everybody.
I have an announcement.

06:58.635 --> 07:01.464
-What is it?
-And... sent.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.814
-JIMMY: I feel like
we haven't given

07:03.858 --> 07:05.599
enough attention
to how thrilling it is

07:05.642 --> 07:07.949
-that Becca is pregnant again.
-No, no, no!

07:07.992 --> 07:09.559
Jimmy, no!

07:09.603 --> 07:12.475
But what is so extraordinary
about this event

07:12.519 --> 07:15.260
is the method by which
it transpired.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.741
You see, as it turns out,

07:17.785 --> 07:21.702
Paul used nature's baster.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.921
His willy! He used his willy!

07:23.965 --> 07:29.492
Paul put his penis inside Beccaand moved it in and out.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.408
-Party officially set off.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.543
What-What?

07:36.586 --> 07:39.546
This is the first I'm hearing
of this shocking news.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.548
You guys are so lucky
you have us

07:41.591 --> 07:43.637
to make your lame-o party
awesome.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.987
-Hey...

07:47.684 --> 07:51.079
Okay, we're stopping at
the liquor store immediately.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.921
Oh, I can actually have
more than one because

08:06.964 --> 08:09.663
most women don't even knowthey're pregnant at this point.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.579
You've done a lot of shitty
things to me over the years--

08:12.622 --> 08:14.798
dropped me in the laundry chute,

08:14.842 --> 08:17.322
made me sleep in the backyard
because I breathed too loud--

08:17.366 --> 08:19.803
but sleeping with my husband
was the lowest,

08:19.847 --> 08:21.979
and I'm including
that summer you told me

08:22.023 --> 08:24.678
I had to drink your pee
or I wouldn't get boobs.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.810
Lindsay, I swear to you

08:26.854 --> 08:30.205
it was as passionless
as sex has ever been.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.513
You should know.
You married him.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.613
Oh, do I have a booger?

08:46.656 --> 08:48.745
Let's make a promise
that we'll do this forever,

08:48.789 --> 08:51.618
that this, our freest selves,
shall e'er rule

08:51.661 --> 08:55.622
and that marriageshall not change us in any way.

08:55.665 --> 09:00.235
I don't know. In five years,
my freest self might be sober.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.628
That's not funny.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.281
Who knows
what our lives will be?

09:03.325 --> 09:05.066
We can make
these big declarations,

09:05.109 --> 09:06.720
but it doesn't mean anything.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.722
Or worse,
we think it means something,

09:08.765 --> 09:10.419
so we force ourselves
to be this,

09:10.462 --> 09:12.508
even though
that's not who we are anymore.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.251
-But I am who I am.
-I am, too. For now.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.820
What's your favorite part?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.257
-Of what?
-Of the script, man.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.694
Come on. Was it
the Ramones concert intercut

09:24.738 --> 09:26.740
with Neville Chamberlain
announcing conscription?

09:26.783 --> 09:30.700
Or Kitty's seduction atthe hands of the church rector?

09:30.744 --> 09:33.834
It was all really good, Jimmy.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.880
Well, that was markedly
disappointing. For our next...

09:36.924 --> 09:38.316
Well, well, well.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.797
: Edgar,
I thought you had jury duty.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.844
Oh, um, the guy confessed.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.280
Crazy.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.848
Uh, Jimmy,
this is Paul F. Tompkins.

09:47.891 --> 09:51.895
Hey, Jimmy.
Any friend of Edgar's.

09:51.939 --> 09:56.073
So, what are you guys
up to on this glorious Sunday?

09:58.162 --> 10:00.861
Howdy, everybody!
My name is Paul F. Tompkins,

10:00.904 --> 10:04.125
-and I will be your host
for this party.

10:04.168 --> 10:08.216
I regret to inform youthe old plan died of being lame.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.565
-Oh!

10:09.609 --> 10:10.871
-Boo!
-New plan:

10:10.914 --> 10:13.917
-we're going to Las Vegas!

10:13.961 --> 10:15.527
-Hit it!

10:15.571 --> 10:17.529
Oh.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.010
-♪ Vegas♪

10:20.054 --> 10:23.057
♪ We're on our way
to Las Vegas♪

10:23.100 --> 10:25.712
♪ We're gonna go

10:25.755 --> 10:28.715

10:28.758 --> 10:30.804

10:32.893 --> 10:35.243

-Hi, buddy.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.897
We have a question.
What were you doing

10:36.940 --> 10:40.378
while another man
was having sex with your wife?

10:40.422 --> 10:42.337
Uh...

10:42.380 --> 10:44.905
I think I was watching a movie.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.907
Oh. What movie
were you watching?

10:46.950 --> 10:48.604
Was it A Cuckwork Orange?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.171
The Hunt for Red Cucktober?

10:50.214 --> 10:51.912
Uncle Cuck? The Mighty Cucks?

10:51.955 --> 10:54.305
-The Joy Cuck Club?
-Cuckleberry Finn?

10:54.349 --> 10:55.959
The Marx Brothers in Cuck Soup?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.569
-Good Night and Good Cuck?

10:57.613 --> 10:58.919
One Flew Over
the Cuck-oo's Nest?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.355
-Mooncuck?
-Ha!

11:00.398 --> 11:02.574
Sick burns. So comical.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.359
Excuse me for a second.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.930
I'm looking real bad
in this scenario, nerd.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.497
I got to tell 'em
the full, triumphant story.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.629
Vernon, you can't do that.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.936
-Hmm.-EDGAR:
The Cuck-il Wears Prada.

11:15.979 --> 11:17.633
What's it worth to you?

11:20.244 --> 11:21.898
Are you on Venmo?

11:21.942 --> 11:23.857
Mm-hmm.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.554
BECCA:
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

11:25.597 --> 11:27.774
-You know what? No, listen!

11:27.817 --> 11:29.819
You all should be ashamed
of yourselves.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.954
Vernon is a strong, secure man
who should be celebrated

11:33.997 --> 11:36.957
-for his open-mindedness.
-Aw, thanks, Bec.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.090
Yeah. And actually, I think
the movie he was watching was

11:40.134 --> 11:43.790
-I Heart Cuckabees!

11:43.833 --> 11:45.748
Didn't see that coming,
did you, cuck?

11:45.792 --> 11:48.446
-Hey-o!

11:50.797 --> 11:52.668
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:52.712 --> 11:55.627
-No, Vernon, no!
-I was there, too, you guys!

11:55.671 --> 11:57.891
I was in the room
where it happened.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.675
-I was a part of it!

12:00.807 --> 12:02.896
I came, too! So hard!

12:04.027 --> 12:05.246
We all came at the same time.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.987
It was super sexual.

12:07.030 --> 12:10.033
I helped his dong back in
and then Bec blew harder

12:10.077 --> 12:12.819
than she ever blew before.
We held hands after.

12:12.862 --> 12:16.953
I tried to kill myself, and thesex made me want to stay alive!

12:16.997 --> 12:19.913
That's about it!
I yield my remaining time!

12:19.956 --> 12:21.741
Sunday Funday!

12:30.053 --> 12:31.576
Who here's from out of town?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.665
Oh.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.023
So, you picked up a bus driver
and invite him

12:43.066 --> 12:45.155
-into your marriage bed?
-Oh!
-What?

12:45.199 --> 12:46.374
-No, no.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.464
-Let me explain.
-I don't trust him, Jimmy.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.422
He's got that same look
in his eyes he had that day

12:51.466 --> 12:53.381
he made me eat
all that sour cream.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.687
Oh, you're just mad that he'smaking this party actually fun.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.689
Now, shush. I want to see
who he's going to

12:57.733 --> 12:59.039
take the piss out of next.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.955
Oh, you two are getting married!

13:01.998 --> 13:03.957
-That's right!

13:04.000 --> 13:06.046
Oh, so great.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.048
Now, you know, things will
change after you get married.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.441
That's right. About to gain
that marriage weight, sucka!

13:12.008 --> 13:13.662
So have you two had
all the big discussions?

13:13.705 --> 13:15.011
-We will.
-Oh.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.709
-Will is my handsy uncle.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.973
Let's knock some of these out
right now.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.018
First question:
If you have a boy,

13:22.062 --> 13:23.890
-will he be circumcised?
-JIMMY: Yes.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.109
-Everyone calls it a turtle.
-No, that's mutilation.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.068
Will you raise your child
with religion?

13:28.111 --> 13:30.461
-Absolutely not.
-Yes.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.550
Wait, why is everything
about children?

13:32.594 --> 13:34.857
Next question:
Do you want children?

13:34.901 --> 13:38.078
-Probably not.
-Absolutely.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.731
-You're not religious.
-Yes, I am.

13:39.775 --> 13:42.125
I don't talk about it because
you'll make me feel dumb.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.866
Why would you say
that we want children?

13:43.910 --> 13:46.695
-Because I want them.
-Well, I don't.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.219
This feels bad.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.265
Is it just me,
or does this feel really bad?

13:51.308 --> 13:53.484
-You said you weren't sure.
-Well, I changed my mind.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.052
And I might change it again.Right now these are my beliefs.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.011
But who knows how I'll feel
in a couple years?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.927
Then they're not beliefs.
They're whims.

14:03.146 --> 14:06.671
Ooh, that is not
going to land well.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.936
He's right, we should make thesedecisions before we get married.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.676
What's even the point?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.678
Any rethinking I might do
isn't called "growth"

14:13.722 --> 14:16.507
but "weakness" because Jimmy's
so goddamn set in his ways.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.552
Can't you fucking
adjust something

14:17.595 --> 14:18.988
for me for once in your life?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.555
I have changed for you.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.035
Guys, quick,
name some of the things

14:22.078 --> 14:24.037
I've adjusted for Gretchen.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.735
-Um...
-Uh...

14:26.778 --> 14:28.345
Ha! See?

14:28.389 --> 14:31.958
-You can't name one thing...
-I sucked a dick for you!

14:34.961 --> 14:37.311
I'm sorry, I don't think
I heard that right.

14:39.095 --> 14:43.143
Gretchen told me
to suck a dick, so I did.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.275
I sucked one.

14:45.319 --> 14:49.192
LINDSAY:  I want a guy
to suck a dick for me.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.368
It all makes sense now,
because of how infrequently

14:51.412 --> 14:52.935
he wanted to make love.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.415
Was I at least
on the short list?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.373
I always thought
I'd be dope at that

14:56.417 --> 14:58.810
on account of how good
I am at Popsicles.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.163
Why are we stopping?

15:03.206 --> 15:05.513
-ALL: Oh!

15:05.556 --> 15:09.952
As far as I can hypothesize,I have an optic yeast infection.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.041
Happens to the best
home brewers.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.825
Move. I'll drive.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.218
We've also run out of fuel.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.351
-What?

15:17.394 --> 15:19.875
-I don't have any service.
-What?!

15:19.919 --> 15:21.050
Me neither.

15:21.094 --> 15:24.010
This was your plan
all along, wasn't it?

15:24.053 --> 15:27.187
To trap us out here
in the desert.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.797
I'm simply trying to have fun

15:28.840 --> 15:30.842
with this couple
who, by the way, clearly

15:30.886 --> 15:32.322
-shouldn't be getting married.
-Hey!

15:32.366 --> 15:35.108
Don't make fun of my friends.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.110
Some group of friends, Edgar.

15:37.153 --> 15:40.200
The dick-hungry come loverwhose script you clearly hated.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.766
-Edgar?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.117
I'm sorry, Jimmy, I didn't wantto hurt your feelings.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.249
And the sad girl
he barely even knows

15:46.293 --> 15:48.121
who tricked him
into sucking a dick.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.037
Then there's this
alcoholic Gorgon

15:51.080 --> 15:52.647
who boned her sister's ex.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.997
I had her permission.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.999
-You did not!
-Do me! Do me!

15:57.043 --> 15:58.914
Then there's
her Howdy Doody husband

15:58.958 --> 16:01.221
who's too lame to even
waste a good insult on.

16:01.264 --> 16:04.267
-All right, that's it.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.835
-Get off of this bus!

16:06.878 --> 16:08.706
Oh, let me think about it.
Um, no.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.101
-Get out! Get out!
-Watch yourself, Edgar.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.147
I can make it so you never workin this town again.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.888
I don't care. You can be
as hard on me as you want,

16:16.932 --> 16:20.240
but don't mess with my friends.

16:20.283 --> 16:23.156
What are you gonna do
about it, loser?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.200
I said...

16:26.246 --> 16:28.248
...get out!

16:38.301 --> 16:39.824
EDGAR:
Is he okay?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.826
Is he okay?!

16:41.870 --> 16:43.828
I don't know; I'm having
a hard time remembering

16:43.872 --> 16:45.134
what I'm supposed to do.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.137
R-I-C-E. What's the "I"?

16:50.270 --> 16:53.055
-Where the hell are we?
-PAUL: I may have taken

16:53.099 --> 16:55.188
a wrong turn when the yeast
started to activate.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.059
Why did you have to push him?!

16:57.103 --> 16:58.626
This is so bad.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.628
You guys don't know him
like I do.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.109
He is going to ruin my life.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.154
What are you doing?

17:05.198 --> 17:06.938
He's a hostile combatant!

17:06.982 --> 17:08.288
Oh, stop it.
You're acting

17:08.331 --> 17:10.203
as irrationally
as you did when you decided

17:10.246 --> 17:12.292
my screenplay needed work.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.946
Edgar's right--
we can't trust this guy.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.210
He called me an alcoholic.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.341
PAUL:
What's happening?

17:18.385 --> 17:20.213
Who's fallen?

17:23.825 --> 17:26.480
See? I told you.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.264
TOMPKINS :
What?

17:28.308 --> 17:31.441
-Edgar?

17:31.485 --> 17:33.748
Guys? What's happening?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.097
Do not listen to him.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.534
TOMPKINS:
Edgar.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.711
You got to help me.
My back really hurts.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.236
Why did you push me
down the stairs?

17:43.279 --> 17:45.020
Why are you all
standing over me?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.587
What are you gonna do to me?

17:46.630 --> 17:49.503
I'm sorry if I've been
hard on you at work,

17:49.546 --> 17:51.983
-but don't do this.
-Why do you have this?!

17:52.027 --> 17:54.247
I-I was uncomfortable
working with you.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.685
I mean, you're a disgruntled
employee with PTSD.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.340
-He has a point!
-And then you pushed me
down the stairs.

18:00.383 --> 18:03.038
And then I woke up,and you're all standing over me

18:03.082 --> 18:06.215
in the middle of the desert!

18:07.651 --> 18:10.263
Hey.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.619
-What are we gonna do?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.056
I'll take care of him.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.279
It's okay. I'm fine.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.281
Oh, my God!
What's happening?!

18:28.324 --> 18:31.545
-Someone tell me
what's happening!

18:35.418 --> 18:37.203
I'm so cold.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.770
Why can't I stand up?

18:39.814 --> 18:42.599
What did you do?! He's a doctor!

18:42.643 --> 18:44.210
He said he was gonna
take care of me!

18:44.253 --> 18:45.602
I-I thought he was
coming over to kill me!

18:45.646 --> 18:48.170
I told you he was a psychopath!

18:48.214 --> 18:51.391
Oh, God, and now he's dead.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.350
Just like all of you
are about to be dead.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.092
-What did you say?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.312
Oh, nothing.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.053
Just, um, spitballing here,
but, uh,

19:02.097 --> 19:05.753
I think maybe now
I have to kill all of you.

19:05.796 --> 19:08.234
-: You...
-I'm not joking, fuck-face.

19:08.277 --> 19:11.280
This is actually my dream.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.195
You drew first blood.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.631
The security camera on this bus

19:14.675 --> 19:16.633
will show you pushing me
down the stairs.

19:16.677 --> 19:19.810
But out here, no camera.

19:19.854 --> 19:25.381
Oh, yes, from here on out,
it's all self-defense.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.257
Oh, no.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.911
-No!

19:35.348 --> 19:37.306
You're first, Edgar.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.352
No. No!

19:42.964 --> 19:44.487
He's okay, right?

19:44.531 --> 19:45.923
Yeah.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.925
You're okay. Are you okay?

19:59.154 --> 20:00.590
Oh, my God.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.465
Breathe. Just breathe.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.381
I am. I'm calm.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.905
We-we just killed someone!

20:10.948 --> 20:14.082
JIMMY:
Okay.

20:14.125 --> 20:17.346
We have to leave.
Um... Mexico.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.261
We have to go to Mexico.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.610
You'd do that?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.046
As long as we're together.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.265
-LINDSAY: You guys!

20:23.309 --> 20:26.399
I can't. I can't.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.139
-Calm down.
-I can't!

20:28.183 --> 20:32.100
Gretchen, you have to
hold this for me.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.111
-Shh!

20:47.550 --> 20:49.422
-What the...?
-Surprise!

20:51.337 --> 20:53.513
What is happening?
I don't understand.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.863
Which part?
The part where Lindsay and I

20:55.906 --> 20:57.517
orchestrated the best

20:57.560 --> 21:00.128
bachelor/bachelorette party
ever?

21:01.434 --> 21:05.176
I, uh... yes. I'm speechless.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.526
-Bravo, everyone.
-Yeah.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.397
-Yeah!
-Oh.

21:08.441 --> 21:11.879
-Jimmy, is this real life?

21:20.757 --> 21:24.587
So, pretty good, huh?

21:24.631 --> 21:27.590
You let us murder someone.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.505
How did you...?

21:29.549 --> 21:32.029
Well, we knew
you'd demand real booze

21:32.073 --> 21:34.249
-if we had Paul make home brew.-PAUL: What?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.164
But I brewed the ale
in good faith,

21:36.207 --> 21:37.731
independent of the scheming.

21:37.774 --> 21:40.386
It led us to where Paul F.
Tompkins would be waiting.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.823
And you, sir...

21:42.866 --> 21:45.260
I knew eight years
of stage combat would pay off.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.349
Plus, I make my own squibs.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.220
-Oh.
-So, you and Edgar aren't...

21:49.264 --> 21:52.006
Working together anymore? No.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.225
So, with this, you are free.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.793
And you promise not to goto DB Industries' HR department

21:56.837 --> 22:00.406
with any more allegations
of alleged abuse.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.146
Got to say,

22:02.190 --> 22:05.019
that disgusting threesome runneryou guys made up?

22:05.062 --> 22:07.500
I almost broke, like,
five times.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.504
Oh.

22:11.547 --> 22:14.463
We are not leaving you behind.

22:14.507 --> 22:17.205
-Calm the fuck down.
-Okay.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.605
What?

22:25.648 --> 22:29.391
Mexico?
I thought you hated change.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.742
I suppose there mightbe some circumstances in life

22:32.786 --> 22:35.528
that do change things,
like murder.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.660
Or kids.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.488
Right.

22:39.532 --> 22:42.491
Or murder.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.844
Congrats on knocking up
my big sister, you stud.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.109
I heartily apologize.

22:52.153 --> 22:54.634
It's okay.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.637
-Sister fucker.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.596
Ew, you made my sister come.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.817
-Ew.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.210
No, don't make me laugh.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.647
Tears will feed the yeast.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.478

-One plot hole.
-Hmm?

24:11.101 --> 24:12.538
How did you know we'd shoot him?

24:12.581 --> 24:14.191
Ah, we didn't know for sure,
but you did.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.932
You killed him to save me.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.847
Ultimate bad boy move, huh?

24:17.891 --> 24:19.109
-Yeah.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.155
Wait, where'd you get the gun?

24:21.198 --> 24:23.679
Oh, your dad bought itwhen he came to visit, remember?

24:23.723 --> 24:25.855
You've had a gun in your room
since then?

24:25.899 --> 24:27.683
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow. I've called you

24:27.727 --> 24:30.512
some truly awful things
this past year.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.514
You could've just ended it all.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.560
-Well, yeah, I mean...
-The constant nay-saying,

24:34.603 --> 24:36.431
the endless cooking
and cleaning,

24:36.475 --> 24:38.520
the irrational subservience.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.522
With a simple twitch
of your finger,

24:40.566 --> 24:42.742
the misery could have
ceased forever.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.614
And still, you chose
not to kill yourself.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.704
Bravo, Edgar.

24:51.838 --> 24:56.016
Hey, I'm sorry about the script,Jimmy, but you can't turn it in.

24:56.059 --> 24:59.019
I suspected
it wasn't very good.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.021
Will you help me fix it?

25:01.064 --> 25:03.763
Yeah.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.373
I'll call the studio,
say you're consulting.

25:05.416 --> 25:08.202
-Cowriting.
-Fine.

25:08.245 --> 25:11.597
Just promise you'll never
lie to me again.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.642
I promise.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.042
Gretchen's been stealing meds
from my medicine cabinet,

25:22.085 --> 25:25.219
-a ton of them, for weeks now.
-So what? She loves pills.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.743
No. This is the serious stuff.

25:27.787 --> 25:30.224
And I don't think
it's for fun this time.
