00:00.801 --> 00:02.835
In new york city's
war on crime,

00:02.836 --> 00:05.104
The worst criminal offenders
are pursued

00:05.105 --> 00:07.840
By the detectives
of the major case squad.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.109
These are their stories.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.820
- Thank you for listening
to this whole thing.

00:20.821 --> 00:24.724
I hope I, uh--
I can put it behind me.

00:27.861 --> 00:33.466
As my friend,
I thought you'd understand.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.736
I guess in the end,
it was just about a book.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.939
- You know, I don't think
you came all the way to london

00:39.940 --> 00:41.474
To talk about a book.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.709
- What do you mean?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.646
- I mean...
It's about all the rest of it.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.982
It's about her.

00:49.983 --> 00:53.052
And you have to put it
behind you.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.257
- Well, you say that
like it's, uh, easy, you know?

00:58.258 --> 01:01.027
- No one said
life was easy.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.895
- It's like time stood still
or something.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.096
It was like something
out of dickens.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.233
- No, zachary,
it was out of your life.

01:07.234 --> 01:11.037
That was the problem.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.340
- I didn't think it would
get to me like that, you know?

01:14.341 --> 01:17.210
- And that was
your second problem.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.682
- You know,
if you'd told me that...

01:22.683 --> 01:25.985
I was gonna be there
in that house...

01:25.986 --> 01:28.788
On that day with her...

01:28.789 --> 01:33.526
Feeling the things
that I did...

01:33.527 --> 01:36.262
I wouldn't have
believed it.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.902
- What's up?

01:42.903 --> 01:46.005
- Uh, ask me
at the end of the day.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.573
- You okay?

01:47.574 --> 01:52.612
- Two dead inside.
Dylan weld, 36, art dealer.

01:52.613 --> 01:57.049
And palmer abrigaille, 72,
dealer,

01:57.050 --> 01:58.317
And collector
of rare books.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.587
It appears--

02:01.588 --> 02:05.057
It appears that they, uh...
Killed each other.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.261
Appears...

02:08.262 --> 02:09.395
Oh, boy.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.331
It's a little bit strange
for me.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.367
I know the abrigailles.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.770
- Zach, I'm sorry.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.739
You wanna take the day?

02:19.740 --> 02:23.543
- No, no.
I'll be okay.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.879
I told her I'd be okay.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.782
The truth was
I didn't know what I'd be.

02:29.783 --> 02:35.154
I mean, it was like
I was walking into my own past.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.560
- A swordfight.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.428
Some kind of duel?

02:42.429 --> 02:45.598
- Any violent confrontation

02:45.599 --> 02:48.467
Was very,
very unlike palmer.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.836
- Well, in any case,

02:50.837 --> 02:53.306
They died around 2:00 a.M.,

02:53.307 --> 02:56.275
And the cause appears to be
exsanguination for both.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.578
- The way his sword is held--

02:58.579 --> 03:00.379
It's in his right hand.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.950
Palmer had nerve damage
from a shooting accident.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.886
Poor control of his thumb.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.423
We need to do extensive
blood spatter work here, please.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.058
- I'll get them on it.
- Thank you.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.960
Where's his daughter?
- Uh...

03:13.961 --> 03:15.828
They got her back there.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.799
- I think it's best
if she sees a familiar face.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.772
Lenore?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.977
- Yes, come in.
Sorry.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.112
I'm a bit lost.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.215
There are so many people here.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.557
Zachary.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.925
- Hi.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.328
- Oh...
[sniffles]

03:52.165 --> 03:55.067
Do you know what...
Happened here?

03:55.068 --> 04:00.072
- Between dylan weld
and your father.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.841
I'm looking into that.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.377
- How is my father?

04:04.378 --> 04:06.278
I'm so worried.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.847
- Has nobody told you...

04:07.848 --> 04:09.749
Told you anything?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.751
- No, they...

04:11.752 --> 04:14.620
They brought me back here
and, uh...

04:14.621 --> 04:17.322
I--no.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.091
- I'm so sorry.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.329
Your father...

04:23.330 --> 04:26.532
Is gone.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.301
- What do you mean?
Do you mean--

04:29.302 --> 04:30.970
- He's been killed.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.911
So, so sorry.

Transcript by Adriano_CSI

05:47.493 --> 05:50.495
- This is you.
- Yeah.

05:50.496 --> 05:52.197
That's me and lenore.

05:52.198 --> 05:54.533
Headed out to the, uh,
metropolitan opera

05:54.534 --> 05:57.169
To see tristan and isolde.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.138
See, palmer was an old friend
of my father's,

06:00.139 --> 06:02.374
And his daughter lenore...

06:02.375 --> 06:05.877
Ten years ago, he sent her
to my father for treatment.

06:05.878 --> 06:09.915
She'd begun to exhibit--
show symptoms of...

06:09.916 --> 06:12.083
Schizophrenia.

06:12.084 --> 06:14.486
See, I, uh...

06:14.487 --> 06:16.054
Knew her well.

06:16.055 --> 06:19.825
We were, for a while,
more than friends.

06:19.826 --> 06:22.561
- And you didn't know
she was developing--

06:22.562 --> 06:23.762
- No, no, no.

06:23.763 --> 06:26.665
At first the symptoms
were very odd, and...

06:26.666 --> 06:28.533
You know,
she was always odd.

06:28.534 --> 06:30.202
Wonderfully odd.

06:30.203 --> 06:33.905
Anyway, palmer
was a very sweet man.

06:33.906 --> 06:36.508
I continued to see him
from time to time.

06:36.509 --> 06:39.611
We played chess.

06:39.612 --> 06:42.647
- When did you
last see him, zach?

06:42.648 --> 06:45.217
- I think it was about
a year ago.

06:45.218 --> 06:47.919
But who knows?

06:47.920 --> 06:51.923
Time has its own pace
in this house.

06:51.924 --> 06:54.926
[police radio chatter]

06:54.927 --> 06:56.862
- Yes, captain,
it's definitely affecting him.

06:56.863 --> 06:59.064
I think he should
probably go home.

06:59.065 --> 07:01.566
Good.
We'll need to talk about it.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.134
Uh-huh.

07:03.135 --> 07:05.136
Uh-huh. Uh--
- excuse me.

07:05.137 --> 07:06.505
- Hold on.
Can I help you?

07:06.506 --> 07:08.473
- [british accent] are you with
these policemen?

07:08.474 --> 07:10.542
- Yes.
- I'm richard celeste.

07:10.543 --> 07:13.144
I serve the abrigailles
as caretaker.

07:13.145 --> 07:16.781
I've a message
from mr. Abrigaille.

07:16.782 --> 07:20.252
- Can I call you back?

07:20.253 --> 07:22.320
- Tuesday last,
mr. Abrigaille told me

07:22.321 --> 07:24.456
To buy ts camera
and set it up in the library,

07:24.457 --> 07:25.757
So I did.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.792
And he recorded something
into it,

07:27.793 --> 07:29.661
And then he gave it back to me

07:29.662 --> 07:31.897
And told me that I should
give it to the police

07:31.898 --> 07:33.632
In the event
of any misfortune.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.867
Can I give it to you?

07:35.868 --> 07:38.270
- Sure.

07:38.271 --> 07:40.906
- Well...I've done
my duty then.

07:40.907 --> 07:42.707
- You have blood on you.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.911
- Yes, ma'am.
I tried to...

07:45.912 --> 07:48.213
Resuscitate mr. Abrigaille
when I found him.

07:48.214 --> 07:50.749
They've already taken samples
off me with swabs.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.951
It's mr. Abrigaille's blood.

07:52.952 --> 07:56.121
I'll give them my clothes
as soon as I can change.

07:59.825 --> 08:04.095
- Okay.
- Hey, zach.

08:04.096 --> 08:07.299
The caretaker
gave me this camera.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.302
Supposedly has a message
from palmer abrigaille.

08:10.303 --> 08:12.370
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Sir, I can't let you in.

08:12.371 --> 08:13.805
- Your authority
doesn't extend to me!

08:13.806 --> 08:15.307
- Sir...
- This is my uncle's house.

08:15.308 --> 08:16.474
- Hold on.
- I'm the attorney

08:16.475 --> 08:17.742
For the estate
and the executor.

08:17.743 --> 08:19.744
- Hey. This is a crime scene.

08:19.745 --> 08:22.147
- Are you in charge?
- I'm detective nichols.

08:22.148 --> 08:24.749
This is detective stevens.
We're from the major case squad.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.718
- Merrill abrigaille.
My card.

08:26.719 --> 08:28.286
I knew something
like this would happen.

08:28.287 --> 08:29.988
My uncle
was surrounded by leeches.

08:29.989 --> 08:32.057
- Can we step outside?

08:32.058 --> 08:34.626
- Palmer's income hasn't matched
his outgo in years.

08:34.626 --> 08:37.162
He just wouldn't face reality.

08:37.163 --> 08:40.065
Hat them?
- Palmer's income hasn't matched
his good lord.Ears.

08:40.066 --> 08:42.033
You wouldn't believe
the level of debt.

08:42.034 --> 08:43.902
But thank god the collection
wasn't stolen,

08:43.903 --> 08:45.737
So when can I get it
out of here?

08:45.738 --> 08:47.072
- When did you last
see palmer?

08:47.073 --> 08:48.840
- Yesterday, late afternoon.

08:48.841 --> 08:50.775
- And last night,
where were you?

08:50.776 --> 08:54.279
- Oh. Do you suspect me?
- Put it down to our nature.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.214
- I was at the union club
until 1:00 a.M.

08:56.215 --> 08:57.983
And that's a long way
from this part of town,

08:57.984 --> 09:00.285
Detective...
What was your name?

09:00.286 --> 09:01.786
- Nichols.

09:01.787 --> 09:04.189
- Wait. Zachary nichols?

09:04.190 --> 09:06.524
You knew my uncle.
- Mm-hmm.

09:06.525 --> 09:08.760
- In fact,
you're named in his will.

09:08.761 --> 09:10.662
- That I didn't know.

09:10.663 --> 09:13.665
- Of course, the bulk
of the estate will go to lenore

09:13.666 --> 09:16.134
Or her conservator when it--

09:18.004 --> 09:21.006
Uh, I believe
he left you a chessboard.

09:21.007 --> 09:23.842
Did you two play chess?
- I enjoyed playing with palmer.

09:23.843 --> 09:25.443
- Hmm.

09:28.948 --> 09:30.448
- If anybody's watching this,

09:30.449 --> 09:33.485
I suppose I should apologize
for being murdered.

09:33.486 --> 09:36.855
Oh, well.
Brought it on myself.

09:36.856 --> 09:40.125
But my daughter...

09:40.126 --> 09:43.194
Please...Please see to it
that she's taken care of.

09:43.195 --> 09:45.230
She does well
on her medication.

09:45.231 --> 09:47.699
Just please let her stay here.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.468
It--don't--

09:50.469 --> 09:52.704
Don't send her to one of
those horrible places.

09:52.705 --> 09:54.139
You can sell
my whole collection.

09:54.140 --> 09:55.907
I don't care.

09:55.908 --> 09:58.410
Within these walls,
she makes perfect sense.

09:58.411 --> 10:01.479
I'm being blackmailed
by dylan weld.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.448
Unless I continue
to pay him

10:03.449 --> 10:06.084
And allow him
to continue to--

10:06.085 --> 10:07.952
[groans]

10:07.953 --> 10:10.455
What he's doing with lenore
is unspeakable.

10:10.456 --> 10:13.558
But she...
Allows his liberties

10:13.559 --> 10:15.193
In order to protect us.

10:15.194 --> 10:17.162
In order to keep him
from throwing us out.

10:17.163 --> 10:19.597
But I have failed
to protect her.

10:19.598 --> 10:21.566
It must end.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.968
And, by god,

10:23.969 --> 10:28.373
I will try to end it soon.

10:28.374 --> 10:30.942
So...If I am killed,

10:30.943 --> 10:32.444
Please--it's weld.

10:32.445 --> 10:34.079
Dylan weld.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.316
- Dylan weld didn't kill him.
Someone killed both of them.

10:38.317 --> 10:40.785
The swords,
the way the bodies are lying,

10:40.786 --> 10:42.887
The whole thing.

10:42.888 --> 10:46.591
There were disabling blows
to the heads of both victims.

10:46.592 --> 10:49.594
Afterward, they were stabbed.

10:49.595 --> 10:51.896
I think it's been staged.

11:17.505 --> 11:19.041
- Seeing her that way...

11:19.842 --> 11:21.476
You know, just lost and...

11:21.477 --> 11:23.111
You know, dancing like that,

11:23.112 --> 11:26.147
And remembering what
she once was was, uh, tough.

11:26.148 --> 11:28.516
Tough for me.
- Well, of course.

11:28.517 --> 11:30.685
And obviously,
it must have crossed your mind

11:30.686 --> 11:31.953
That she'd killed them.

11:31.954 --> 11:34.055
- No. Yes.

11:34.056 --> 11:36.424
Well, I didn't want to
think about it, you know?

11:36.425 --> 11:40.128
- So did you ask her directly
if she'd done it?

11:40.129 --> 11:42.330
- I couldn't do that.

11:42.331 --> 11:43.865
- And we both know why,
don't we?

11:43.866 --> 11:46.234
We both know
what you were feeling.

11:46.235 --> 11:48.069
- Yes.

11:48.070 --> 11:50.071
I still loved her.

11:50.072 --> 11:53.508
Or what she'd once been.

11:53.509 --> 11:58.146
You know, I was half hoping
that she would just say

11:58.147 --> 12:00.515
That she'd killed
both those guys,

12:00.516 --> 12:03.084
And I coulda gotten--
gotten out of there.

12:03.085 --> 12:04.519
When's father coming home?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.688
- Lenore, your father--
- hang on.

12:06.689 --> 12:09.023
Oh, lenore, lenore.

12:09.024 --> 12:11.893
Is your father...

12:11.894 --> 12:14.229
Away on a trip?

12:14.230 --> 12:16.264
- They said they took him
into the city.

12:16.265 --> 12:18.366
- Oh.
- And so...

12:18.367 --> 12:22.804
I'm without a protector.

12:22.805 --> 12:24.839
Should I be on my guard,

12:24.840 --> 12:26.641
Zach?

12:26.642 --> 12:29.677
- Nichols.

12:33.649 --> 12:36.184
[lenore humming]

12:38.788 --> 12:40.688
- I don't think
it's right to charm her.

12:40.689 --> 12:44.159
It's possible she killed them.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.195
- The m.E. Is calling it
a double murder.

12:47.196 --> 12:51.032
- Yes, but she now is certain
that what we found was staged.

12:51.033 --> 12:52.834
- Troubling, to say the least.

12:52.835 --> 12:55.370
Anything stolen?
- Impossible to say.

12:55.371 --> 12:58.072
It's a huge collection
of rare books and manuscripts.

12:58.073 --> 12:59.741
- Did I read something
a while about

12:59.742 --> 13:03.044
About an especially rare book
owned by a palmer abrigaille?

13:03.045 --> 13:05.680
Something about the bible?

13:05.681 --> 13:07.816
- The lost licinianus.

13:07.817 --> 13:12.086
It's ostensibly
part of a roman history

13:12.087 --> 13:13.688
Written by...

13:13.689 --> 13:15.190
[beep]

13:15.191 --> 13:18.226
This guy,
granius licinianus

13:18.227 --> 13:21.529
In the second century
of the christian era.

13:21.530 --> 13:25.066
- So it's valuable.
- Priceless. If it even exists.

13:25.067 --> 13:29.604
These are fragments
of one whole text,

13:29.605 --> 13:31.773
The only one
that was ever found,

13:31.774 --> 13:34.609
But he might have written
36 other volumes.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.177
- That's a lot of subjunctive.

13:36.178 --> 13:37.579
Is there anything less vague

13:37.580 --> 13:39.314
Than the possible theft
of a book

13:39.315 --> 13:41.583
Palmer abrigaille
could have possessed?

13:41.584 --> 13:43.651
- A lost licinianus transcript

13:43.652 --> 13:46.554
Was passed from collector
to collector to collector

13:46.555 --> 13:49.390
To collector over the years,

13:49.391 --> 13:53.027
But there's a tradition--
we don't admit we have it.

13:53.028 --> 13:55.063
- But it's human nature to
brag about something like that.

13:55.064 --> 13:56.497
- It's rumored
people were murdered

13:56.498 --> 13:57.932
For simply having read it.

13:57.933 --> 14:00.401
- We just heard.

14:00.402 --> 14:02.904
Please tell us
the diocletian wasn't stolen.

14:02.905 --> 14:05.240
- Or the ravenna codex.
Oh, my god.

14:05.241 --> 14:06.274
The licinianus.

14:06.275 --> 14:08.710
- Hello.

14:08.711 --> 14:10.445
- Oh, we're dear friends
of the abrigailles.

14:10.446 --> 14:12.080
- Now...Who did this
ghastly thing?

14:12.081 --> 14:14.415
- And why?

14:14.416 --> 14:17.252
- So we know quite a bit
about palmer.

14:17.253 --> 14:20.188
So tell us about--
about this dylan weld,

14:20.189 --> 14:21.522
Our other murder victim.

14:21.523 --> 14:24.325
- Shall I?
- Go ahead. I'll interject.

14:24.326 --> 14:27.395
- Every field
has its parasites,

14:27.396 --> 14:29.597
And dylan weld
was one of them.

14:29.598 --> 14:31.833
He was a rare book dealer
who sold to palmer.

14:31.834 --> 14:33.434
- He'd sell something

14:33.435 --> 14:35.803
Then come back months later
to reveal the ugly truth

14:35.804 --> 14:37.605
That it had been stolen
or smuggled.

14:37.606 --> 14:39.674
Then he'd threaten
to make it public.

14:39.675 --> 14:41.876
Dylan was brilliant.

14:41.877 --> 14:43.945
He knew palmer
would be humiliated

14:43.946 --> 14:46.381
If anyone found out
he'd bought stolen goods.

14:46.382 --> 14:49.517
So palmer paid the blackmail.

14:49.518 --> 14:54.188
- Now, get out.

14:54.189 --> 14:56.424
- Where's the girl?

14:59.428 --> 15:02.764
- Go to bed, father.

15:04.433 --> 15:06.834
- It's horrible to think
what lenore went through

15:06.835 --> 15:08.736
To help protect her father.

15:08.737 --> 15:12.073
When that slimy book dealer
had taken advantage of her,

15:12.074 --> 15:14.375
Yeah, I can imagine
that she'd killed him.

15:14.376 --> 15:17.111
But why would she have
killed her father?

15:17.112 --> 15:18.179
- She was schizophrenic.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.580
I mean, she was capable
of anything.

15:19.581 --> 15:21.849
- That's right.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.518
[cell phone rings]

15:23.519 --> 15:24.786
- Stevens.

15:24.787 --> 15:27.055
- How is lenore?

15:27.056 --> 15:29.824
- Hold on. We've got a uni
calling from the crime scene.

15:29.825 --> 15:31.893
There's a moving van
pulling up to the mansion.

15:31.894 --> 15:34.395
[police siren blares]

15:34.396 --> 15:36.197
[tires screeching]

15:36.198 --> 15:38.866
- Mr. Abrigaille!

15:38.867 --> 15:41.102
- Put everything down.
- Stop moving. Hey!

15:41.103 --> 15:43.204
- Get out of the truck.
- Detective...

15:43.205 --> 15:45.373
Detective, I'm the legal
executor of this estate--

15:45.374 --> 15:46.808
- What the hell are you doing?
- I have every right--

15:46.809 --> 15:48.209
- No box.
Gimme the box, gimme the box.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.243
- I have every right
to ascertain

15:49.244 --> 15:51.079
What this property is.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.481
- I'm sorry,
but that man's a thief.

15:53.482 --> 15:55.783
- Merrill was here
last night.

15:55.784 --> 15:57.819
- Yes.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.455
- What did he want?

16:00.456 --> 16:03.458
- T-to convince father
to...Move

16:03.459 --> 16:05.560
And put me
in a puzzle house.

16:05.561 --> 16:09.163
The usual.
- When did he leave?

16:10.833 --> 16:14.836
- I don't know.
Sometime before midnight.

16:17.272 --> 16:18.539
- That book.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.743
You carry that book always.
- Here.

16:21.744 --> 16:23.478
- Oh, a catullus.

16:23.479 --> 16:26.948
- In a wonderful translation.

16:31.286 --> 16:34.088
I have something
important to tell you.

16:34.089 --> 16:35.656
- Yes?

16:43.432 --> 16:45.900
- I love you dearly,
zachary.

16:45.901 --> 16:47.702
I do.

16:47.703 --> 16:50.671
But...I am not free
to marry.

16:50.672 --> 16:54.942
I can't go out there
and be part of your world.

16:54.943 --> 16:59.147
I must remain here and...
Take care of my father.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.150
But if you promise
to tell no one--

17:02.151 --> 17:06.554
I have my reputation
to think of--

17:06.555 --> 17:08.589
We can again be lovers.

17:08.589 --> 17:12.260
- That's a wonderful offer,
lenore.

17:14.863 --> 17:16.931
If we were lovers,

17:16.932 --> 17:18.965
Would we always
be honest with each other?

17:18.967 --> 17:20.601
- Of course.

17:20.602 --> 17:23.604
- How can I be sure?
- You want to test me?

17:23.605 --> 17:26.808
- Tell me a secret.
- About what?

17:26.809 --> 17:30.711
- Tell me about...

17:30.712 --> 17:33.314
Who was here last night

17:33.315 --> 17:36.484
After merrill left.

17:36.485 --> 17:39.253
- Well...Dylan weld,
of course.

17:39.254 --> 17:41.889
- Mm-hmm...

17:41.890 --> 17:45.193
- And...

17:45.194 --> 17:48.763
- Yes?

17:48.764 --> 17:51.365
- And the man
who comes at night.

17:53.102 --> 17:55.770
- "the man who comes at night"?

17:55.771 --> 17:57.505
Who's he?

17:57.506 --> 17:59.574
- I don't know.

17:59.575 --> 18:02.443
No one sees him.

18:02.444 --> 18:04.645
I just hear him.

18:04.646 --> 18:07.348
But...

18:07.349 --> 18:10.485
If you came one night...

18:10.486 --> 18:13.421
Maybe we could
look for him.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.792
- We've done background checks
on all our potential suspects,

18:17.793 --> 18:19.727
And they've all
come back clean.

18:19.728 --> 18:21.295
As for the caretaker,
richard celeste,

18:21.296 --> 18:22.630
We've got nothing on him.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.532
Talking to callas.

18:24.533 --> 18:27.401
He claims he's a british
subject, so...

18:27.402 --> 18:29.670
We might have some luck
with the embassy.

18:29.671 --> 18:32.073
- Hey, hey,
stop right there.

18:32.074 --> 18:34.108
I caught you
red-handed!

18:34.109 --> 18:37.145
- I'll call you back.

18:37.146 --> 18:38.479
- Open your coat!
Stop right there.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.014
I'm not gonna let you
steal from me!

18:40.015 --> 18:41.682
- Hey! Let him go!

18:41.683 --> 18:43.551
- What, are you kidding me?

18:43.552 --> 18:47.255
I caught him red-handed.
Look inside his coat!

18:47.256 --> 18:48.756
- Open your coat.
What's going on?

18:48.757 --> 18:51.492
- Bernard, do not say a word.
We must demand a lawyer.

18:51.493 --> 18:53.528
- What's happening?

18:53.529 --> 18:55.563
What's this?

18:55.564 --> 18:57.198
What is this?

19:00.002 --> 19:02.069
- The objects we remove--

19:02.070 --> 19:03.871
They're not even noticeable!

19:03.872 --> 19:05.873
And--and...

19:05.874 --> 19:08.409
Well, how do you think the damn
bills there get paid?

19:08.410 --> 19:10.378
- Tell them, bernard.

19:10.379 --> 19:14.348
- We've kept palmer afloat
by pilfering.

19:14.349 --> 19:16.417
But every cent
went to pay the bills.

19:16.418 --> 19:18.853
- Even cent.
I keep the accounts.

19:18.854 --> 19:20.788
- Well, we'll need more than
your word on that.

19:20.789 --> 19:22.456
- Look--look!
My checkbook.

19:22.457 --> 19:26.294
Everything that has abrigaille
within a parenthetical.

19:29.398 --> 19:30.665
- There's quite a bit.

19:30.666 --> 19:32.934
- Poor palmer
had no head for figures.

19:32.935 --> 19:34.969
- No interest in anything
less than four centuries old.

19:34.970 --> 19:37.972
- We loved palmer.
And lenore--please protect her.

19:37.973 --> 19:41.309
- We are antiquarians.
We choose to live in the past.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.377
But she...Has no choice.

19:43.378 --> 19:46.147
- She lives the same day
over and over again.

19:46.148 --> 19:48.382
But it's such a lovely day.

19:48.383 --> 19:51.185
- Have you ever heard her
refer to...

19:51.186 --> 19:54.622
The man who comes at night?

19:54.623 --> 19:56.857
- No. It must be a delusion.

19:56.858 --> 19:58.960
- Unless she means merrill.

19:58.961 --> 20:01.295
Merrill was always there.

20:01.296 --> 20:03.965
He constantly
pressured palmer.

20:03.966 --> 20:05.900
- Merrill, do me the courtesy.

20:05.901 --> 20:08.369
You never cared a damn
for this place

20:08.370 --> 20:10.538
Or all that I've collected.
- That's not true.

20:10.539 --> 20:13.441
If you move here
and we liquidate,

20:13.442 --> 20:15.943
You can save the better--
- bah.

20:15.944 --> 20:17.912
- Is something
the matter, sir?

20:17.913 --> 20:21.048
- Yeah. This place
is a damn madhouse.

20:21.049 --> 20:23.017
You're a good fit here.

20:23.018 --> 20:25.786
- Merrill needed palmer
and lenore out of the way

20:25.787 --> 20:27.888
To take control of the estate.

20:27.889 --> 20:29.056
- Good night, sir.

20:29.057 --> 20:31.559
- Palmer was surrounded
by greed.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.994
- Most of us think greed's

20:32.995 --> 20:34.795
A pretty common motive
for murder.

20:34.796 --> 20:36.764
- Yes, greed, jealousy,
and hatred.

20:36.765 --> 20:38.099
Those are the standards.

20:38.100 --> 20:42.303
But this case
was anything but standard.

20:48.566 --> 20:50.000
- Merrill is facing disbarment.

20:50.001 --> 20:51.635
Apparently, he is accused

20:51.636 --> 20:54.604
Of setting up various
legal wealthy clients

20:54.605 --> 20:56.740
With a certain blackmailer.
- Dylan weld.

20:56.741 --> 20:58.875
- With whom he was partners
years ago.

20:58.876 --> 21:01.978
So merrill sets dylan up
with his clients

21:01.979 --> 21:03.513
As a purchasing advisor

21:03.514 --> 21:06.249
On their arts and antiquities
acquisitions,

21:06.250 --> 21:08.385
And then dylan
later struck off on his own.

21:08.386 --> 21:10.086
- I have something on celeste.

21:10.087 --> 21:11.755
His british passport's a fake.

21:11.756 --> 21:14.891
- Call I.N.S.
We'll threaten deportation.

21:14.892 --> 21:17.327
- I say wait till
we have more answers.

21:17.328 --> 21:19.229
Let him be.

21:19.230 --> 21:21.965
Whe-when--

21:21.966 --> 21:24.434
When did this...Get here?

21:24.435 --> 21:26.369
Oh, it's from lenore.

21:26.370 --> 21:29.639
We've been invited
to a dinner party,

21:29.640 --> 21:32.375
An informal wake for palmer.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.544
- And you're actually
suggesting we...

21:34.545 --> 21:37.414
- Palmer has a legendary
wine cellar.

21:37.415 --> 21:41.484
No better way to
interact with our players.

21:41.485 --> 21:44.254
- Whatever will I wear?

21:44.255 --> 21:46.589
- I can't grace this table
as my father once did

21:46.590 --> 21:49.693
With his wit,
his vast knowledge

21:49.694 --> 21:54.097
Of all that was beautiful
and steeped with meaning.

21:54.098 --> 21:56.833
- Yes. You've got
something here, just a little...

21:56.834 --> 22:00.303
- I will miss him so.

22:00.304 --> 22:02.439
This wine goes poorly
with my medication.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.240
[clink]

22:04.241 --> 22:07.343
- You know, zachary,

22:07.344 --> 22:09.479
I have another secret.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.981
- I imagine you have several.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.617
- That book everyone was
wondering about some time ago?

22:14.618 --> 22:18.955
- The lost licinianus?

22:18.956 --> 22:20.190
Yes?

22:20.191 --> 22:22.625
- Well...He did buy it.

22:22.626 --> 22:25.161
And it's the strangest thing.

22:25.162 --> 22:26.796
Father says I've seen it
a hundred times,

22:26.797 --> 22:28.398
But I have no memory of it.

22:28.399 --> 22:29.766
Isn't that odd?

22:29.767 --> 22:32.402
- Lenore, where do you think
it might be?

22:32.403 --> 22:33.970
- I haven't
the slightest idea.

22:33.971 --> 22:36.873
You know how I am
with keeping track of things.

22:36.874 --> 22:39.776
- Hmm. Hey, would it be okay
if, after dinner,

22:39.777 --> 22:41.611
We took a little look?

22:41.612 --> 22:44.214
- It's fine.

22:44.215 --> 22:45.949
More wine?

22:47.752 --> 22:50.487
- Would I know it if I saw it?

22:50.488 --> 22:53.223
- Well, it's a bound
manuscript,

22:53.224 --> 22:55.225
And it's...
Written in latin.

22:55.226 --> 22:57.794
- Half these books
are in latin.

22:57.795 --> 23:00.163
- Mm-hmm.
- Are these, uh, greek?

23:00.164 --> 23:03.800
- That's pindar.
That's a very famous poet.

23:03.801 --> 23:06.236
- You read greek?
I'm very impressed.

23:06.237 --> 23:09.839
- Yeah, well, p.S. 91--
not heavy on the classics,

23:09.840 --> 23:13.710
But my father did force
the alphabet on me.

23:13.711 --> 23:16.746
Alpha, beta, gamma, delta--
here.

23:16.747 --> 23:18.782
[greek pronunciation]
"aristoteles."

23:18.783 --> 23:20.517
Here, here.

23:20.518 --> 23:22.652
"platonos."
I don't know what that is.

23:22.653 --> 23:24.521
- Politeia.

23:24.522 --> 23:27.423
It's a 17th-century
dutch edition.

23:27.424 --> 23:29.092
Full of errors. Dreadful.

23:29.093 --> 23:31.194
But lovely binding, though.

23:31.195 --> 23:32.862
- Since you're in the trade,
regina,

23:32.863 --> 23:35.799
What's the supposed value
of the lost licinianus?

23:35.800 --> 23:37.600
- It's impossible to say.

23:37.601 --> 23:39.969
- Everything
has an assessed value.

23:39.970 --> 23:43.640
- It's one of only two portions
of licinanus's history of rome,

23:43.641 --> 23:45.375
Assuming it exists.

23:45.376 --> 23:46.609
- The other is a tiny fragment

23:46.610 --> 23:48.745
In the palimpsest
in the british museum.

23:48.746 --> 23:50.180
- Palimpsest?

23:50.181 --> 23:51.781
- It's an ancient book
that's been erased

23:51.782 --> 23:53.149
And written on a second time.

23:53.150 --> 23:55.218
- Very common
in the middle ages.

23:55.219 --> 23:57.220
- When books
were made of parchment,

23:57.221 --> 23:59.422
And parchment was expensive.

23:59.423 --> 24:02.091
- With modern technology,
it's possible to read both

24:02.092 --> 24:03.793
Without destroying either text.

24:03.794 --> 24:06.863
- Is it the content that makes
the licinianus so valuable?

24:06.864 --> 24:09.098
- It's generally believed
that it deals with

24:09.099 --> 24:11.467
Certain events
in the first century...

24:11.468 --> 24:13.002
In palestine.

24:13.003 --> 24:15.605
- The official roman view
of a certain trial

24:15.606 --> 24:18.575
That could differ greatly
from what we believe we know.

24:18.576 --> 24:21.144
- The trial of jesus.

24:21.145 --> 24:22.445
[thud]

24:22.446 --> 24:23.913
- Did you hearhat?

24:23.914 --> 24:27.383
[thud]
- well, what is it?

24:27.384 --> 24:30.520
[thudding]
- I don't know.

24:30.521 --> 24:32.689
Let's go see.

24:37.094 --> 24:40.330
Have you noticed any stairs
up to the attic?

24:40.331 --> 24:42.065
- Uh-uh.
- I can't seem to find

24:42.066 --> 24:44.267
Any way to acc--
[clattering]

24:49.473 --> 24:52.909
This is palmer's room.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.278
There's somebody in there.

25:00.584 --> 25:02.685
- What are you doing?

25:02.686 --> 25:05.288
- Putting mr. Abrigaille's
clothes away.

25:05.289 --> 25:08.491
- Step away from that chest.
Why are you doing that?

25:08.492 --> 25:10.727
- In spite of the condition
of this house,

25:10.728 --> 25:13.229
I've always made an effort
to be orderly, sir.

25:13.230 --> 25:15.231
- Sleeping pill.

25:15.232 --> 25:17.800
- Did you touch those?
- No, sir.

25:17.801 --> 25:19.903
I left it there for him
last night.

25:19.904 --> 25:23.706
- How do you get to the attic?

25:23.707 --> 25:25.108
- Beg pardon, sir?

25:25.109 --> 25:26.609
- The attic.
Where are the stairs?

25:26.610 --> 25:28.044
- I don't know, sir.

25:28.045 --> 25:29.846
I've never had call
to enter the attic.

25:29.847 --> 25:31.347
- How long
have you worked here?

25:31.348 --> 25:34.851
- Three years.
If you'lexcuse me, sir.

25:56.373 --> 25:58.174
- Hmm.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.498
Isn't this, uh...

26:22.499 --> 26:25.568
- Oh. What a priest carries
for his final unction.

26:27.271 --> 26:30.473
- Why would celeste have this,
unless he was a priest?

26:30.474 --> 26:33.810
- Let's get my laptop.

26:33.811 --> 26:36.813
Well, this old bio
from that diocese

26:36.814 --> 26:38.748
Has him born in quebec.

26:38.749 --> 26:41.017
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually ordained in canada.

26:41.018 --> 26:42.952
- Well, does it actually...

26:42.953 --> 26:45.788
Say that, uh...
He served as a priest?

26:45.789 --> 26:47.991
- Uh-huh. Nine years.

26:47.992 --> 26:51.494
He belonged to an order,
a sect called the conclave.

26:51.495 --> 26:54.697
- Conclave. Wait, does that--
is that like the...

26:54.698 --> 26:56.232
Knights templar?

26:56.233 --> 26:58.868
- Or not, that's like the--
- opus dei?

26:58.869 --> 27:00.503
- Yeah.
- In fact, the conclave

27:00.504 --> 27:03.205
Were more extreme
ultra-traditionalists.

27:03.206 --> 27:06.208
They were...In fact,
excommunicated.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.177
Charged with destroying
church documents

27:08.178 --> 27:10.045
Relating to the purging
of the jews from Spain.

27:10.046 --> 27:13.449
Now we know a little
something about him.

27:13.450 --> 27:14.850
- Yeah.

27:14.851 --> 27:17.219
That's all very helpful.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.222
But, uh, you know what
I'm thinking?

27:20.223 --> 27:23.192
Those noises at night...

27:23.193 --> 27:25.294
We need to find an attic.

27:25.295 --> 27:28.264
[tapping]

27:29.799 --> 27:31.667
[hollow thunk]
hmm?

27:33.336 --> 27:34.603
[thunk, thunk]
hear that?

27:34.604 --> 27:37.106
- False back?
- I'm not sure.

27:37.107 --> 27:40.142
Uh...Maybe there's a latch
someplace here.

27:40.143 --> 27:41.176
Hello.

27:41.177 --> 27:43.012
[sliding sound]

27:54.991 --> 27:58.127
[hinges squeak]

27:58.128 --> 28:00.663
[birds flapping]

28:00.664 --> 28:02.598
- Oh, yeah.

28:02.599 --> 28:05.367
- Look at all these books.

28:05.368 --> 28:07.703
[flapping]

28:07.704 --> 28:10.205
- Ah, I think I know.

28:10.206 --> 28:12.575
You see anything
like a hand truck

28:12.576 --> 28:14.777
Or some kind of...

28:17.814 --> 28:19.915
- Here.

28:19.916 --> 28:23.385
- Okay. There a way
to turn that on?

28:25.255 --> 28:26.555
Uh-huh. All right.

28:26.556 --> 28:29.592
- Like to share, or are you
content just to gloat?

28:29.593 --> 28:32.227
- [chuckling]
infrared, ultraviolet.

28:32.228 --> 28:36.365
This is how you read
a palimpsest.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.367
The erased ink is visible

28:38.368 --> 28:43.272
Only on the edges
of the visible spectrum.

28:43.273 --> 28:47.276
Somebody...Set all this up,

28:47.277 --> 28:50.245
Came up here at night,
making noises,

28:50.246 --> 28:52.815
Thumping up those stairs
with...

28:52.816 --> 28:56.185
Box loads of books
on that hand truck.

28:56.186 --> 28:57.853
- Looking for
the lost licinianus?

28:57.854 --> 28:59.722
- That's right.
- Who?

28:59.723 --> 29:02.324
- I have a good guess.

29:02.325 --> 29:06.895
But I haven't the slightest
ability to prove anything...

29:06.896 --> 29:09.031
Yet.

29:11.534 --> 29:13.102
- It's so lovely
after it rains.

29:13.103 --> 29:15.638
The light
through the oak leaves.

29:15.639 --> 29:20.309
- That book...
That you carry always?

29:20.310 --> 29:24.079
Catullus.
You like it, huh?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.148
- Ever since father
gave it to me,

29:26.149 --> 29:28.651
I can't seem to put it down.

29:28.652 --> 29:31.487
He wrote of such
ordinary things--

29:31.488 --> 29:34.023
A night...A love...

29:34.024 --> 29:37.993
Laughter.

29:37.994 --> 29:40.796
It's a comfort to believe
such things endure.

29:40.797 --> 29:43.132
- May I see that, please?

29:43.133 --> 29:47.236
- You may have it.
- No. Just for a little while.

29:47.237 --> 29:51.040
Then I'll give it back to you.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.008
Are you cold?

29:53.009 --> 29:54.576
- A bit.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.858
You're lucky, zachary,
you're not sick.

30:09.859 --> 30:11.660
- Sick?

30:11.661 --> 30:16.832
- In the way that I'm sick.

30:16.833 --> 30:20.035
I'm not...Unaware
of what is wrong with me.

30:20.036 --> 30:22.671
- I'm fine.

30:22.672 --> 30:26.241
- You had no choice
but to leave me.

30:26.242 --> 30:29.812
I understand.

30:29.813 --> 30:33.816
Don't be sad.

30:33.817 --> 30:36.919
Here in this place with...

30:36.920 --> 30:42.124
My dreams or...
Whatever they are,

30:42.125 --> 30:44.827
I'm fine too.

30:48.732 --> 30:51.066
- [exhales]

30:51.067 --> 30:53.001
Some things are gonna happen.

30:53.002 --> 30:58.440
Some, uh, confusing and...

30:58.441 --> 31:02.111
Disturbing things.

31:02.112 --> 31:06.815
But, uh...

31:06.816 --> 31:09.318
This will always
remain your home.

31:20.930 --> 31:24.299
- Was she able to help?

31:24.300 --> 31:27.469
- Yes, she was. Um...
[object clatters]

31:27.470 --> 31:30.072
Do you have a pen?
- Uh-huh.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.876
- Mr. Celeste.

31:35.645 --> 31:36.712
- Yes, sir.

31:36.713 --> 31:40.315
- I'd like to get everybody

31:40.316 --> 31:43.051
Except miss abrigaille

31:43.052 --> 31:46.588
Brought to the attic.

31:46.589 --> 31:48.590
I'm gonna reveal the identity

31:48.591 --> 31:51.293
Of mr. Abrigaille's killer.

31:51.294 --> 31:54.329
- Yes, sir.

32:00.707 --> 32:01.840
- I didn't know
if I was right,

32:01.841 --> 32:05.644
But the pieces
were starting to...Fit.

32:05.645 --> 32:07.646
- But why not have lenore
there?

32:07.647 --> 32:11.483
Risk her
but the pieces
having a nervous breakdown.

32:11.484 --> 32:13.552
- So now it was about
the book.

32:13.553 --> 32:15.187
- Yes. The lost licinianus.

32:15.188 --> 32:19.625
And who wanted it most...
And why?

32:19.626 --> 32:21.160
Merrill, this lands
squarely on you.

32:21.161 --> 32:23.262
You killed your uncle.
- What?

32:23.263 --> 32:24.930
I did no such thing!
[huffs]

32:24.931 --> 32:27.666
I wasn't here, okay?
I was in the club.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.803
- But you brought dylan weld
into his life.

32:30.804 --> 32:32.304
For what? Money.

32:32.305 --> 32:34.606
- I didn't know--
- you knew, you knew!

32:34.607 --> 32:36.909
Because that was
your deal with dylan.

32:36.910 --> 32:40.512
And your uncle died while
preparing to confront him.

32:40.513 --> 32:42.281
- No. What happened
was never intended.

32:42.282 --> 32:44.082
You can't blame me.
- Palmer thought

32:44.083 --> 32:46.819
That it was so likely
that dylan weld would kill him

32:46.820 --> 32:48.954
He even left a video message
saying so.

32:48.955 --> 32:51.557
And later that night
when dylan was here,

32:51.558 --> 32:53.292
He heard something--

32:53.293 --> 32:55.761
The man who comes at night.

32:55.762 --> 32:59.198
And he came to this attic,

32:59.199 --> 33:00.799
And he saw someone.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.769
- Dylan couldn't have known
about this attic.

33:03.770 --> 33:04.770
- No.

33:04.771 --> 33:06.839
The person

33:06.840 --> 33:09.608
That beat him unconscious

33:09.609 --> 33:11.877
Then dragged him
down those stairs

33:11.878 --> 33:15.080
And stabbed him...
Wasn't dylan weld.

33:15.081 --> 33:18.217
That person
also killed dylan weld

33:18.218 --> 33:22.387
And then staged a cover-up.

33:22.388 --> 33:24.556
- Be careful
placing that tray, celeste.

33:24.557 --> 33:26.525
The note in the bag
is evidence.

33:26.526 --> 33:27.526
- Merrill...

33:27.527 --> 33:29.795
You will leave this house,

33:29.796 --> 33:32.731
And you will never, ever

33:32.732 --> 33:34.666
Come back here again.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.135
- You can't give me orders.
- You forget.

33:37.136 --> 33:38.670
I'm named in the will.

33:38.671 --> 33:41.206
And an heir can contest
an executor.

33:41.207 --> 33:43.375
And this heir
will see you prosecuted

33:43.376 --> 33:47.112
For bringing down a scheme
of blackmail on palmer.

33:47.113 --> 33:48.680
It's a felony.

33:48.681 --> 33:52.017
So go and find an attorney.

33:55.221 --> 33:58.657
- If not dylan or merrill,
then...Who?

33:58.658 --> 34:00.259
- We have the name.

34:00.260 --> 34:03.395
Palmer himself wrote it down
on a piece of paper

34:03.396 --> 34:05.264
When he looked up
those attic stairs

34:05.265 --> 34:06.698
And saw his killer.

34:06.699 --> 34:08.667
Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

34:10.803 --> 34:12.304
- In the ensuing struggle,

34:12.304 --> 34:15.706
The paper must have fallen
out of his pocket.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.844
But in typical palmer fashion,

34:18.844 --> 34:22.748
He wrote that name
in ancient greek.

34:22.748 --> 34:25.284
- I read greek.
- Yes!

34:25.284 --> 34:28.253
But you didn't read
that piece of paper.

34:28.254 --> 34:32.658
There's only one person here
who has read that name...

34:32.659 --> 34:35.159
Somebody who wants this book

34:35.161 --> 34:37.429
More than anything in the world,

34:37.429 --> 34:39.998
Wanted it so badly
that they'd kill for it.

34:39.998 --> 34:43.201
That person...
Has read the name.

34:43.202 --> 34:45.203
Who...

34:45.204 --> 34:47.505
Are...

34:47.507 --> 34:49.675
You?

34:49.676 --> 34:50.809
- What?

34:50.810 --> 34:52.110
- Who are you?

34:52.110 --> 34:55.480
- I am, as I've said,
richard celeste.

34:55.481 --> 34:58.150
- Just downstairs
when I said

34:58.151 --> 35:00.819
That we had identified
palmer's killer,

35:00.820 --> 35:04.056
You froze momentarily
with concern.

35:04.057 --> 35:06.024
But now just a moment ago

35:06.025 --> 35:09.127
When you were serving me
the brandy,

35:09.128 --> 35:11.296
You were getting a little...
Smiley.

35:11.297 --> 35:12.564
What happened?

35:12.565 --> 35:13.932
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:13.933 --> 35:16.101
- When you first
came in here

35:16.102 --> 35:18.603
And you put down
your brandy tray,

35:18.604 --> 35:22.407
You peeked
at that piece of paper.

35:22.408 --> 35:24.076
Do you read ancient greek?

35:24.077 --> 35:26.678
- Read greek?
I'm a servant.

35:26.679 --> 35:31.116
- The name that you read
is...

35:31.117 --> 35:33.118
His name.

35:33.119 --> 35:36.321
Isn't that why
you were smiling?

35:36.322 --> 35:38.690
- All right,
suppose I did read it?

35:38.691 --> 35:41.059
It says I didn't kill him.
- Classical greek...

35:41.060 --> 35:43.261
That you learned
from the seminary.

35:43.262 --> 35:45.297
And from the conclave.

35:45.298 --> 35:47.199
You learned about licinianus

35:47.200 --> 35:49.468
And his account of a trial

35:49.469 --> 35:52.371
That might possibly differ
from the gospel.

35:52.372 --> 35:53.905
- What does it matter?

35:53.906 --> 35:56.742
Palmer's note--
I did not kill him!

35:58.177 --> 36:01.313
- Problem is palmer
didn't write this--he did.

36:01.314 --> 36:05.617
Your reaction's
as good as a confession.

36:05.618 --> 36:07.686
- I confess to nothing!

36:07.687 --> 36:09.554
- And for years...

36:09.555 --> 36:14.426
You followed this,
planning to burn it.

36:14.427 --> 36:17.229
That's it.
That's the book.

36:17.230 --> 36:20.165
Never on the shelves.
It was in lenore's hand.

36:20.166 --> 36:21.833
She did the strangest thing

36:21.834 --> 36:24.436
You can do with a priceless
book--she read it.

36:24.437 --> 36:29.041
Licinianus...Lies beneath
the lines of catullus.

36:29.042 --> 36:33.111
This is a palimpsest.

36:33.112 --> 36:36.381
But you know that,
don't you?

36:36.382 --> 36:38.083
That's why...

36:38.084 --> 36:42.187
You rigged these lights.

36:42.188 --> 36:45.157
There it is.
An ancient account

36:45.158 --> 36:49.261
Of a trial that might shake
your single-minded faith,

36:49.262 --> 36:52.731
Because maybe
the trial was political.

36:52.732 --> 36:56.034
Maybe jesus was never
denounced by the jews.

36:56.035 --> 36:59.104
Is that the knowledge
that you fear?

36:59.105 --> 37:01.673
- [chuckles]

37:01.674 --> 37:06.111
[american accent]
you could never understand.

37:07.747 --> 37:11.883
And killing palmer
was never my intent.

37:11.884 --> 37:13.718
He was merely an obstacle.

37:16.456 --> 37:18.156
- Right.

37:18.157 --> 37:20.659
And when you realized
that he saw you here

37:20.660 --> 37:24.062
And you were gonna get fired
and be forced away--

37:24.063 --> 37:26.098
- Give it to me!

37:27.800 --> 37:29.434
I'm on a mission from god!

37:29.435 --> 37:31.837
- If you were on a mission
from god,

37:31.838 --> 37:34.239
You wouldn't have killed

37:34.240 --> 37:38.443
For this.

37:38.444 --> 37:41.413
- Please.

37:41.414 --> 37:43.982
Please let me have it.

37:43.983 --> 37:45.717
Let me touch it.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.961
- No.

37:55.962 --> 37:59.030
So when I--I found
that priest's kit

37:59.031 --> 38:02.901
That's when I knew.
In that drawer of palmer's,

38:02.902 --> 38:06.204
- So he killed them
then gave them last rites.

38:06.205 --> 38:10.108
- Yeah. How 'bout that?
A priest till the end, huh?

38:10.109 --> 38:12.110
- So what will happen
to lenore?

38:12.111 --> 38:14.946
- She's gonna be...Okay,

38:14.947 --> 38:16.781
'cause the collection
of palmer's

38:16.782 --> 38:19.351
Turned out to be more valuable
than anybody thought.

38:19.352 --> 38:22.254
She's gonna be in that house
if she wants to be,

38:22.255 --> 38:24.122
You know,
for the rest of her life.

38:24.123 --> 38:26.424
- Where are they taking celeste?
- Uh, don't worry, my dear.

38:26.425 --> 38:28.093
Things will come back
to normal.

38:28.094 --> 38:30.762
Now, we intend to be
part of your life,

38:30.763 --> 38:32.797
Look after things here.

38:32.798 --> 38:34.799
Good night.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.235
- We'll see you tomorrow,
dear.

38:43.576 --> 38:45.944
- Zachary.
- Yes.

38:49.282 --> 38:52.517
- You're leaving too.

38:52.518 --> 38:55.620
- Yes.

38:55.621 --> 38:57.422
- May I ask you a question?

38:57.423 --> 39:00.192
- Yes, ocourse.

39:02.762 --> 39:05.130
- Why do you never kiss me?

39:08.734 --> 39:11.603
- I will...

39:14.740 --> 39:16.775
- When?

39:22.381 --> 39:25.250
- Tomorrow.

39:34.060 --> 39:37.829
You know, you only fall in love
for the first time

39:37.830 --> 39:40.565
Just once.

39:40.566 --> 39:42.534
And she was that person
for me.

39:42.535 --> 39:45.337
You know,
she was not just beautiful.

39:45.338 --> 39:48.240
She was just magical.

39:57.216 --> 40:01.219
I've gotta finally let go
of this whole thing.

40:01.220 --> 40:04.089
Ha, it's so mysterious,
isn't it?

40:04.090 --> 40:07.692
It's kind of like when
we first fell for each other,

40:07.693 --> 40:10.128
I suppose.

40:10.129 --> 40:12.697
And, you know,
if you really love somebody,

40:12.698 --> 40:15.700
Maybe it never goes away.
