[Foreboding music]

00:46.910 --> 00:49.340
Man: I was up a
couple of weeks ago

00:49.350 --> 00:50.840
and the whole area
was flooded.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.980
Couldn't even get in
past the gate.

00:54.180 --> 00:57.480
You gotta be careful of the
weather up this way. Yeah.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.350
About a week ago,

00:58.350 --> 01:00.020
just north of here? Snow.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.690
Everything covered
for four days.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.520
And then it flooded down here.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.530
So, like that, we'd have to
bring the truck in.

01:06.530 --> 01:09.560
But I'm not supposed to be
doing that on my own.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.130
Walking like this, these
conditions? No problem.

01:13.270 --> 01:17.240
But, if I get stuck in here, now
with the truck or the ATV?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.940
Maybe get hurt or something,
you know?

01:20.410 --> 01:21.740
I'm in shit with the daughter.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.280
Make sure, now, everybody
got the right clothing.

01:29.290 --> 01:33.020
'Cause, you know, you'd catch
your death up here.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.990
Yeah. Well, I don't think
I'll be that lucky.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.630
What are you calling it, again?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.530
Incredible Violence.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.100
Well, there it is.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.340
Full basement and three stories.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.040
If we don't sell it
out from under you-

01:55.040 --> 01:57.780
It's yours to use.

01:59.080 --> 01:59.980
Looks good.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.420
And no one is around?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.090
Take a look.

02:05.420 --> 02:07.320
You can scream blue
murder out here.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.990
There's not a neighbour
around to hear you.

02:10.990 --> 02:12.860

02:53.800 --> 02:55.570

and the windows, now.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.170

02:59.410 --> 03:00.810

03:17.290 --> 03:20.030
She's a real fan of that stuff.

03:20.030 --> 03:21.700

recognize the house

03:28.640 --> 03:30.440

03:30.810 --> 03:32.440
I'll have to write
that down now,

03:32.440 --> 03:34.510
so I remember when
it comes out.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.410
Who knows,

03:35.410 --> 03:36.610
you might even come up with

03:36.610 --> 03:39.410
a better name for it by then.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.420
Are you looking for a couple
of dead people?

03:42.420 --> 03:45.950
Myself and the daughter
would love to be a part of it.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.990

could accommodate her.

I'm not the sort of fella
who'd give something,

03:59.400 --> 04:01.400

in return, you know.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.960
They gave me two hundred
and fifty k.

How much is left?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.440

04:38.810 --> 04:39.740
- I don't know.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.840
It went here and there.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.010
- You spend a quarter of a
million dollars here and there?

04:45.010 --> 04:47.110
- It was sitting in my bank
account for months.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.750
I was supposed to make
the movie months ago.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.890

it off and I put it off.

05:00.630 --> 05:03.900

05:03.900 --> 05:05.300
- I think it's fraud.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.830
Isn't it?

05:07.070 --> 05:08.370
- Yeah, Patrick.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.000
It's major league fucking fraud.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.540

05:19.420 --> 05:21.350
- You're not that sure.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.620
- It's like... a group
of investors.

05:26.590 --> 05:27.550
You know, like...

05:29.120 --> 05:30.520
Like a group.

05:33.830 --> 05:34.860

05:38.600 --> 05:41.500
- Like a legal organization?

05:44.040 --> 05:44.940
Are you serious?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.340
- Now that you mention it.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.280
It was all very creepy.

- You're gonna die, man.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.520

05:58.920 --> 06:00.390
- Makes sense.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.760
I thought they'd do.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.830
- Can you get people to
work on it for free?

06:11.230 --> 06:14.430
- Actors, yes, absolutely.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.940
Those people would
do anything for free.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.710
Crew, though?

06:22.140 --> 06:25.150
For a horror movie,
you need stunts, makeup.

06:25.850 --> 06:26.910
Special effects.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.150
Lights and sound, camera.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.150

06:33.160 --> 06:36.260
Free is not a
realistic option.

gonna be a lawyer?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.590

actors for his slasher film.

So, he doesn't
think that's weird.

09:49.550 --> 09:50.620
So, he goes on over.

looks normal.

Oh, and before that,
the director -

He sends the actor guy some
footage, or stuff to look at.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.730
And it looks legit.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.230
So, he goes on over.

completely off his tits.

he doesn't know what hit him

10:12.470 --> 10:13.970
Until he's tied to a chair.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.710

is slicing him up.

to try to figure out why
everyone in Germany

46:50.040 --> 46:51.370

46:53.240 --> 46:54.470
I don't know it.

46:56.040 --> 46:59.740
Basically, a guy would
come into a room,

46:59.750 --> 47:01.050
and there'd be a button.

47:02.580 --> 47:05.320
Another guy, who was
dressed like a doctor-

47:05.320 --> 47:08.620
He would tell him to
push the button.

47:08.620 --> 47:10.570
And when he did,

47:10.570 --> 47:12.520
he'd hear someone cry out
in agony in another room.

47:14.230 --> 47:17.530
And then the doctor would tell
him to push the button again.

47:17.730 --> 47:19.530
And the experiment
was to figure out

47:19.530 --> 47:20.900
if he'd push the button

47:20.900 --> 47:24.770
knowing that it would cause
someone he didn't know, pain.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.340
I wouldn't push it.

47:30.780 --> 47:32.710
I'd like to think so too.

47:33.710 --> 47:35.210
Turns out, most people would.

47:37.750 --> 47:43.050

doctor's responsibility.
