WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:09.177
- ( thunder rumbling )
- ( rain pattering )

00:13.947 --> 00:15.549
GOOD MORNING, MIA.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.852
HI. ME AGAIN.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.489
COME IN, PLEASE.

00:25.993 --> 00:29.463
I KNOW 7:00 IS EARLY,
BUT IT'S THE ONLY TIME
THAT I COULD COME.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.265
NO, IT'S OKAY.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.267
YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY--

00:33.367 --> 00:35.203
20 YEARS AGO
I WAS IN BROOKLYN,
YOU WERE IN THE CITY,

00:35.303 --> 00:37.171
AND NOW IT'S
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.074
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S TRUE.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.711
I KNOW YOU'VE SPOKEN
WITH ELLIS ABOUT YOUR CASE

00:43.811 --> 00:45.446
AND HE IS ON TOP OF IT,
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT PLEASED,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.581
- I HOPE YOU'LL LET ME KNOW.
- OH, THANK YOU,

00:47.681 --> 00:49.617
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE REFERRAL.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.721
YOU HAVE MORE LIGHT
IN HERE THAN YOU HAD

00:53.821 --> 00:55.589
IN YOUR OLD OFFICE
ON 10th STREET.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.627
YEAH, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.633
IT'S STRANGE
TO BE BACK.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.271
THIS COUCH IS BETTER.

01:10.371 --> 01:14.142
THE OLD ONE WAS
BLUE WITH BLACK PILLOWS.

01:14.242 --> 01:17.411
MMM. YOU HAVE
A GOOD MEMORY.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.613
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS FUNNY

01:19.713 --> 01:22.250
THAT YOU HAD
A BLACK AND BLUE COUCH.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.621
( theme music playing )

01:45.273 --> 01:46.974
I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST WEEK.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.809
OH, IT WAS FINE.

01:48.909 --> 01:52.112
NO, IT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL
AND IT SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED.

01:52.213 --> 01:55.115
WELL, AS YOU SAID,
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.718
WELL, IT WAS
EMBARRASSING

01:57.818 --> 02:00.053
AND THAT'S
WHY I CALLED--

02:00.154 --> 02:03.724
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
AND JUST TALK ABOUT IT.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.626
GOOD.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.829
AND I UNDERSTAND
YOUR SAYING NO TO
HAVING A DRINK--

02:08.929 --> 02:10.798
THAT'S TOO PERSONAL.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.568
ANYWAY, I'M HAPPY
TO COME IN, HAVE A SESSION

02:14.668 --> 02:17.871
AND JUST TRY TO
CLEAN UP THE MESS I MADE.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.508
I SHOULD'VE
BROUGHT A MOP.

02:20.608 --> 02:25.446
SO YOUR FEELINGS KIND OF
CAUGHT YOU BY SURPRISE?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.348
BUT THAT WAS BACK
ON LAST MONDAY

02:27.448 --> 02:29.116
AND YOU CALLED ME
ON FRIDAY.

02:29.217 --> 02:33.321
DID IT TAKE YOU
THAT LONG TO DECIDE?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.055
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
IF I WANTED TO.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.157
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
JUST TO LET THINGS GO--

02:37.258 --> 02:40.194
DON'T GO FERRETING
AROUND FOR MORE PROBLEMS.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.300
I JUST REALLY
DIDN'T THINK I WOULD
LOSE IT LIKE THAT.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.104
AND YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT HOW I SET IT UP.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.073
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT

02:53.173 --> 02:55.876
I SAID
YOU SET IT UP.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.745
OH, BUT I DID.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.048
ELLIS COULDN'T BE THERE,
I SAW YOUR NAME ON THE FILE

03:01.148 --> 03:02.616
AND I GRABBED IT.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.353
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUN

03:05.453 --> 03:06.954
JUST TO NEEDLE YOU
A LITTLE

03:07.054 --> 03:09.423
AND IMPRESS YOU.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.060
OH, I WAS IMPRESSED.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.928
TILL BENNETT WALKED IN.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.997
CAN I SMOKE?

03:17.097 --> 03:19.533
- ACTUALLY, I'D PREFER
IF YOU DIDN'T.
- OH, REALLY?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
- YEAH.
- GOD, EVERYONE IS
SO HEALTHY.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.671
WHY IS THAT?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.506
EVEN BENNETT HATES THAT.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.975
IF YOU CAN'T
SMOKE AFTER SEX,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

03:28.075 --> 03:30.978
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU AND BENNETT
ARE INVOLVED?

03:31.078 --> 03:32.913
I FIGURED YOU HAD
FIGURED THAT OUT.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.350
OH, I DID NOTICE
YOUR MANNER CHANGED AFTER
HE CAME INTO THE ROOM, YEAH.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.186
HE KNEW YOU WERE
MY OLD THERAPIST,

03:39.287 --> 03:41.989
HAD TO MARK THE ROOM
LIKE THE DOG HE IS.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.259
OH, SO YOU THINK
IT WAS TERRITORIAL?

03:47.328 --> 03:49.430
AND KIND OF FUNNY,
CONSIDERING.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.633
- HOW SO?
- I'M SURE YOU NOTICED
HE WEARS A RING.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.469
- I DID.
- YEAH, IT'S BAD ENOUGH
TO SLEEP WITH A MARRIED MAN,

03:55.569 --> 03:57.571
BUT WHEN HE'S YOUR BOSS,
IT'S REALLY PATHETIC, RIGHT?

03:57.671 --> 04:00.741
I'M SURE YOU HAD
YOUR REASONS.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.479
YEAH, I HAD BEEN SEEING
THIS OTHER GUY-- ANDRE--

04:05.579 --> 04:07.581
AND THAT WAS FADING FAST,
SO I JUST THOUGHT

04:07.681 --> 04:09.617
"WELL, I'LL HAVE
A LITTLE FLING WITH BENNETT

04:09.717 --> 04:12.553
AND IT'LL BE EASIER
TO LET ANDRE GO IF THEY
OVERLAP A LITTLE."

04:12.653 --> 04:14.154
IS THERE--
I THINK THERE'S
A TERM FOR THAT.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.757
IT'S CALLED SHINGLING.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.426
( chuckles )

04:18.526 --> 04:23.130
- RIGHT, WELL, WHO WANTS
TO HAVE A LEAKY ROOF?
- ( chuckles )

04:23.230 --> 04:26.934
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD LAST, YOU KNOW,
PAST A MONTH WITH BENNETT.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.304
BUT IT HAS LASTED.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.642
YEAH, OVER A YEAR NOW.
NOBODY KNOWS.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.478
THAT'S A LONG TIME
TO KEEP A SECRET.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.414
HE SAID HE WAS
GONNA LEAVE HIS WIFE,

04:40.514 --> 04:43.984
HE WANTED
TO BE WITH ME,

04:44.084 --> 04:46.420
AND I BELIEVED HIM.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.323
I MEAN,
IT DOES HAPPEN.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.024
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DO
LEAVE THEIR WIVES,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.160
EVEN FOR OLDER WOMEN.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.497
- THEY DO.
- WELL, HE DIDN'T.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.803
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.673
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.875
SO NOW I NEED
TO MEET SOMEONE ELSE.
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY?

05:07.975 --> 05:11.211
- ( both laugh )
- SO NOW YOU WANT ME TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMEBODY?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.381
SURE. I DON'T NEED
A THERAPIST,

05:13.481 --> 05:15.449
- I NEED
A MATCHMAKER.
- OKAY.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.851
YOU THINK I WOULD BE
A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.720
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.155
JUST FIGURE OUT
WHO I'M ATTRACTED TO

05:22.255 --> 05:25.493
AND THEN
PICK SOMEONE ELSE.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.231
YOU DO OWE ME.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.766
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I-- I OWE YOU?

05:32.866 --> 05:36.437
I-- I DON'T-- I DON'T
GET WHAT YOU MEAN.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.806
( sighs )

05:38.906 --> 05:40.608
WHAT IF I STOOD
BY THE WINDOW
AND SMOKED?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.476
YOU CAN STAND
WHEREVER YOU LIKE, MIA,

05:42.576 --> 05:45.178
BUT I WOULD STILL RATHER
YOU DIDN'T SMOKE.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.448
OKAY.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.951
DON'T SET ME UP.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.286
I'M SURE
BENNETT WILL CALL.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.723
( sighs )

05:56.724 --> 05:59.126
HIS WIFE NEVER
HAS SEX WITH HIM.

05:59.226 --> 06:03.531
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW PEOPLE CAN STAY
MARRIED LIKE THAT. I--

06:05.332 --> 06:07.601
YOU'RE DIVORCED, RIGHT?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.537
I MEAN, I KNOW
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK,

06:09.637 --> 06:11.639
BUT SINCE I'M NOT
REALLY A PATIENT--

06:11.739 --> 06:13.841
DID YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.711
WHEN YOU SAY THAT

06:17.811 --> 06:19.813
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT YOU'RE A PATIENT,

06:19.913 --> 06:23.651
- I THINK THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS--
- YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.089
YOUR WIFE FOUND OUT,
SHE LEFT YOU

06:29.189 --> 06:30.624
AND NOW YOU'RE ALONE.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.927
AND HERE WE ARE,

06:34.027 --> 06:36.063
TOGETHER AGAIN.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.733
HUH.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.202
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
THIS PAST WEEK

06:42.302 --> 06:44.705
WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED
IF YOU AND I HAD JUST
RUN INTO ONE ANOTHER

06:44.805 --> 06:46.974
IN SOHO OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.242
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD'VE HAPPENED?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.211
( silent )

06:51.311 --> 06:52.846
OH, PROBABLY NOTHING.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.216
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.
I'M SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY TROUBLE

06:56.316 --> 06:59.052
FINDING WOMEN
WITH THE ACCENT
AND THE EYES.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.420
( breathes deeply )

07:00.521 --> 07:02.623
YOU PROBABLY ALREADY
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.259
SEE, IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.662
HOW IS IT
DIFFERENT FOR YOU?

07:09.863 --> 07:12.365
IT JUST IS.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.235
DO YOU FEEL THAT
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTIVE?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.370
NO, I THINK
I LOOK FINE.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.239
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT HAVING SEX.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.142
- I CAN FIND THAT.
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.944
- YEAH.
- MMM.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.646
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MEET

07:25.746 --> 07:28.849
A SMART, INTERESTING,
AVAILABLE MAN

07:28.949 --> 07:31.552
- WHO'S OVER 40?
- NO, WHAT'S IT LIKE?

07:31.652 --> 07:34.387
WELL, THE POOL IS
EXCEEDINGLY SMALL.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.956
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE EITHER MARRIED

07:36.056 --> 07:37.958
OR THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON
WHY THEY'RE NOT MARRIED.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.529
AND IF THEY'RE DIVORCED,
THEY WANT THEM YOUNG.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.031
I BET THE LAST WOMAN
YOU FELL FOR

07:44.131 --> 07:45.566
WAS-- WHAT? --30.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.035
ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF SOMEBODY LIKE ME

07:48.135 --> 07:50.804
WOULD BE ATTRACTED
TO SOMEBODY LIKE YOU?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.707
ANSWERING A QUESTION
WITH A QUESTION?

07:53.807 --> 07:57.711
YOU SOUND
LIKE BENNETT.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.413
LAWYERS SHOULD NEVER BE
WITH OTHER LAWYERS.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.816
I WONDER IF HIS WIFE IS
SLEEPING WITH HIM AGAIN.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.519
I TAUGHT HIM WHAT TO DO,
SHE GETS THE BENEFITS.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.155
AND WHAT-- WHAT DID
YOU TEACH HIM TO DO?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.257
GOD, THE FIRST TIME...

08:11.859 --> 08:14.461
IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS LIKE
DOING IT WITH A SALMON.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.363
DO YOU EVER WATCH THOSE--

08:16.463 --> 08:18.465
THOSE NATURE DOCUMENTARIES?

08:18.566 --> 08:20.367
YOU KNOW,
WHERE THE MALE SALMON

08:20.467 --> 08:23.136
FRANTICALLY KIND OF
JERKS AROUND

08:23.236 --> 08:27.340
FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS
WITH IT'S MOUTH GAPING OPEN

08:27.440 --> 08:29.309
AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

08:29.409 --> 08:32.479
NOT TO MENTION
THERE'S NO HANDS,

08:32.580 --> 08:36.249
TONGUE-- NEVER REALLY
TOUCHES THE FEMALE.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.086
SO YOU TURNED
BENNETT FROM A--

08:40.253 --> 08:42.656
FROM A FISH
INTO A MAN.

08:42.756 --> 08:46.126
THAT SOUNDS MYTHIC.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.761
OH, YEAH,
A REAL FAIRY TALE,

08:47.861 --> 08:50.297
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHERE
THE PRINCESS FUCKS THE FROG

08:50.397 --> 08:51.599
AND TURNS HIM
INTO A PRINCE

08:51.699 --> 08:54.868
AND THEN HE GOES BACK
TO HIS FRIGID FROG WIFE.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.104
( chuckles )

08:57.204 --> 08:59.072
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

08:59.172 --> 09:02.109
I'M THINKING IT'S
A GOOD THING YOU DON'T
WRITE CHILDREN'S BOOKS.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.678
( both laugh )

09:07.180 --> 09:09.282
DO I LOOK LIKE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND CHILDREN,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.919
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY
AND YOU DO?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.420
NO, IT WAS JUST--

09:13.520 --> 09:15.488
NO. SORRY,
IT WAS A BAD JOKE.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.324
THAT'S FINE.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.894
I'M NOT
AT MY MOST JOVIAL.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.131
- I THINK
I HURT YOUR FEELINGS.
- NO NO, IT'S JUST--

09:25.733 --> 09:28.268
OH, NEVER MIND.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.971
WHAT IS IT?

09:33.641 --> 09:36.276
I DON'T HAVE
ANY CHILDREN

09:37.845 --> 09:40.347
AND NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE I WON'T.

09:41.715 --> 09:45.185
I-- MY F.S.H. LEVEL IS
HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD BE.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.555
- OH.
- YEAH, AND I'M 43.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.759
I'M A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THAT,
AND MY DOCTOR SAID THAT IF
I WANTED TO GET PREGNANT,

09:51.859 --> 09:55.829
I SHOULD'VE DONE IT
YESTERDAY OR MAYBE
FIVE YEARS AGO.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.766
I MEAN, IT'S STILL
THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.501
IT MUST'VE
BEEN HARD TO HEAR.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.637
IT WASN'T
A COMPLETE SURPRISE.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.806
I'D STOPPED TAKING
THE PILL WITH BENNETT

10:05.906 --> 10:09.109
OVER THE SUMMER
AND NOTHING HAPPENED, SO--

10:09.209 --> 10:12.746
BUT YEAH,
I WENT TO SEE
MY DOCTOR ON MONDAY.

10:12.846 --> 10:16.183
THE SAME DAY
THAT YOU AND I MET?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.051
YUP, THAT AFTERNOON.

10:18.151 --> 10:22.255
YOU-- YOU'RE IMPLYING
THAT THERE'S A CONNECTION?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.591
AM I?

10:24.692 --> 10:27.661
WELL, DO YOU THINK
THERE IS A CONNECTION?

10:28.528 --> 10:31.264
OKAY. YES.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.770
SEEING YOU
JUST MADE ME--

10:36.870 --> 10:38.939
MADE ME THINK ABOUT

10:39.039 --> 10:41.675
MY LIFE.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.817
- WH-- WHEN DID YOU
GET THE RESULTS?
- ON FRIDAY.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.085
- DID YOU TELL BENNETT?
- MM-HMM.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.653
AND WHAT DID HE SAY?

10:53.754 --> 10:56.423
- HE TOLD ME
TO GET OUT.
- GET OUT?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.425
WHERE--
WHERE WERE YOU?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.060
I DROVE
TO HIS HOUSE

11:00.160 --> 11:02.229
IN LARCHMONT.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.598
I TOLD HIS WIFE
IT WAS A WORK EMERGENCY.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.601
HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.
I HAD TO SIT THERE AND WAIT

11:08.702 --> 11:11.338
WITH GWEN, THE KIDS
AND THE TACKY ANTIQUES.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.607
- AND DID HE SHOW UP?
- YEAH, EVENTUALLY.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.243
WE WENT INTO HIS STUDY
AND I TOLD HIM--

11:16.343 --> 11:18.278
I TOLD HIM
THAT I WANTED
TO SEE A SPECIALIST

11:18.378 --> 11:20.180
AND I NEEDED TO GET
PREGNANT RIGHT AWAY.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.716
HE JUST SAID
"GET OUT"?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.785
THAT AND...

11:26.854 --> 11:29.389
THAT HE DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME ANYMORE.

11:30.724 --> 11:34.161
OH.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.064
AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU CALLED ME--
AFTER YOU HAD SEEN BENNETT.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.567
- YEAH.
- WELL, IT'S A HELL
OF A WEEK YOU HAD.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.070
YOU GET THESE TEST RESULTS
FROM YOUR DOCTOR,

11:43.170 --> 11:44.838
YOU GET REJECTED
BY BENNETT,

11:44.938 --> 11:48.876
AND IT KIND OF ALL BEGINS
WITH MEETING ME ON MONDAY.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.511
IN A WAY...

11:51.611 --> 11:55.215
IT REALLY ALL STARTED
20 YEARS AGO.

11:55.315 --> 11:59.152
YOU MEAN WHEN
I WAS YOUR THERAPIST?

11:59.252 --> 12:02.022
I WAS WONDERING--

12:02.122 --> 12:05.826
ALL THESE YEARS LATER,
NOW THAT YOU KNOW
HOW IT TURNED OUT,

12:07.660 --> 12:09.763
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT PREGNANCY?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.200
WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.668
NO. NO, PAUL,

12:15.769 --> 12:17.871
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.573
SEEING ME LAST WEEK,

12:20.673 --> 12:23.343
DID IT
MAKE YOU QUESTION

12:23.443 --> 12:25.979
THAT DECISION?

12:26.079 --> 12:29.682
NO, SEEING YOU
ONLY MADE IT WORSE.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.752
SO YOU'VE BEEN STRUGGLING
WITH THIS FOR SOME TIME?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.287
YOU KNOW, IT'S IRONIC.

12:34.387 --> 12:38.826
WHEN I WAS LOOKING
AT YOUR CASE FILE,

12:38.926 --> 12:40.760
I DID THE MATH--

12:40.861 --> 12:45.032
YOUR WIFE WAS PREGNANT
AT THE SAME TIME I WAS,

12:45.132 --> 12:47.600
BUT YOU THOUGHT THAT
I SHOULD GET AN ABORTION.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.536
YOU THINK I WANTED YOU
TO GET AN ABORTION?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.905
IT WAS
A MUTUAL DECISION.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.741
WE MADE IT TOGETHER?

12:54.842 --> 12:57.310
HOW DID
WE DO THAT, MIA?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.079
UM, I WAS 22,

12:59.179 --> 13:01.614
YOU WERE
MY THERAPIST.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.917
I WAS GETTING READY
TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL,

13:04.017 --> 13:06.253
I GOT PREGNANT
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK
I SHOULD HAVE IT.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.522
- AND WHAT TOLD YOU THAT?
- OH, COME ON.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.259
- MAYBE YOU CAN REMIND ME.
- WHY DON'T YOU LOOK OVER
YOUR OLD SESSION NOTES?

13:12.359 --> 13:15.095
OR HAVE YOU
NOT EVEN KEPT THOSE?

13:16.363 --> 13:19.332
YOU SOUND--
YOU SOUND KIND OF ANGRY.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.302
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU APPEAR TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE WHOLE THING--

13:22.402 --> 13:23.736
THE GIFT
THAT I GAVE YOU,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.705
AND THE DECISION
THAT WE MADE.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.208
- I-- I DON'T--
- FORGET IT.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.643
WHAT IS THE POINT?

13:30.743 --> 13:33.280
OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN'T
BRING THE BABY BACK,

13:33.380 --> 13:35.883
BUT WE MIGHT
BOTH LEARN SOMETHING

13:35.983 --> 13:37.684
IF WE TALK ABOUT IT.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.488
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT WE MAY HAVE
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

13:41.588 --> 13:45.158
- THERE ARE FACTS.
- AND WHAT WOULD THEY BE?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.560
YOU CHALLENGED ME
CONSTANTLY.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.463
DID I WANT TO GIVE UP
LAW SCHOOL?

13:50.563 --> 13:53.533
WAS I READY TO BECOME
A PARENT? DID I WANT
TO GET MARRIED?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.235
AND WHAT WERE
THE ANSWERS?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.170
YOU THOUGHT
IT WOULD RUIN MY LIFE.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.939
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT I SAID?

13:59.039 --> 14:02.709
I DO REMEMBER
TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR ANXIETY

14:02.809 --> 14:06.179
IN RELATION
TO BEGINNING LAW SCHOOL

14:06.279 --> 14:08.348
AND SEPARATING
FROM YOUR FAMILY.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.185
AND I THINK YOU HAD DOUBTS
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND

14:12.285 --> 14:14.487
AT THE TIME.
HE WAS A MUSICIAN, RIGHT?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.990
- A DRUMMER.
- YEAH.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.727
YOU WOULD THINK HIS TIMING
WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER.

14:20.827 --> 14:24.364
- IT WAS A JOKE, PAUL.
- I-- I GET IT.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.467
- WHAT WAS HIS NAME AGAIN?
- STEVIE.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.939
HE FIXED CARS
DURING THE WEEK

14:32.039 --> 14:34.774
AND DID GIGS
ON THE WEEKEND.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.145
I'D FOLLOW HIM AROUND
TO ALL THESE DIVES.

14:40.313 --> 14:44.151
HE HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL
LONG HAIR THAT WOULD
GO FLYING EVERYWHERE.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.953
BUT YOU KNOW
EVERYONE SAID

14:46.053 --> 14:47.820
"HE'S A MUSICIAN MECHANIC.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.789
- HE'S NOT FOR MIA."
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.092
I THINK I LOVED HIM

14:53.293 --> 14:56.429
AND I--
I LET HIM GO.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.600
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?

15:02.335 --> 15:05.939
HE WAS RIGHT THERE
NEXT TO ME.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.375
WHAT WERE WE THINKING,

15:08.475 --> 15:10.043
THAT SOMEBODY BETTER
WAS GONNA COME ALONG,

15:10.143 --> 15:12.645
SOMEBODY
MY FAMILY LIKED?

15:16.649 --> 15:19.086
AND NOW...

15:19.186 --> 15:22.689
NOW I'M HERE AND THIS
IS WHAT I HAVE.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.930
- AND I WISH
I COULD GO BACK.
- TO WHAT?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.101
TO THAT MOMENT

15:34.201 --> 15:36.669
RIGHT BEFORE
I LOST HIM.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.672
YOU WERE THERE, PAUL.

15:42.775 --> 15:47.247
MAYBE THIS IS WHY
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
MIA-- TO GO BACK.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.717
TO GO BACK TO THAT MOMENT
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.189
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED?
I MISSED IT.

15:56.289 --> 16:00.193
I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW STEVIE FELT
ABOUT ALL THIS.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.962
OH, HE DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW I WAS PREGNANT.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.734
- OH.
- YEAH, THE PERSON
I TOLD WAS MY FATHER.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.569
HE WAS GREAT
ABOUT IT.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.505
- HE WAS COMPLETELY
SUPPORTIVE.
- IN WHAT WAY?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.807
WELL, I MEAN HE WAS UPSET
ABOUT IT AT FIRST,

16:14.907 --> 16:18.011
OF COURSE, BUT THEN
HE SAID WHATEVER
I WANTED TO DO,

16:18.111 --> 16:20.313
HE'D BE THERE FOR ME.

16:20.413 --> 16:24.717
WE EVEN MADE
A LIST OF THE PROS
AND CONS TOGETHER.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.319
HE DID EVERYTHING--

16:26.419 --> 16:28.155
HE FOUND THE DOCTOR,
HE PAID FOR IT,

16:28.255 --> 16:30.757
HE TOOK ME TO
THE APPOINTMENT.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.559
YOU REMEMBER HIM
AS BEING

16:32.659 --> 16:36.429
SO PERFECTLY THERE
FOR YOU, SO PRESENT,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.765
AND I WAS THE ONE
WHO LET YOU DOWN.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.169
- HE EVEN ARRANGED
FOR THE ABORTION.
- YEAH, OF COURSE HE DID,

16:42.269 --> 16:45.605
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.541
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK YOU
TOLD ME THAT 20 YEARS AGO.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.044
DO YOU KNOW WHY NOT?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.947
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT MY FATHER.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.250
WE'RE FINE.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.253
HOW MANY FATHERS
AND DAUGHTERS HAVE

17:00.353 --> 17:02.122
AS GOOD
OF A RELATIONSHIP?

17:02.222 --> 17:04.391
AND YOU'RE
STILL VERY CLOSE.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.693
- MM-HMM.
- IN FACT,
HE CALLED YOU TWICE

17:06.793 --> 17:08.295
WHEN I WAS
IN THE OFFICE.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.163
YEAH. I MEAN,
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT?

17:10.263 --> 17:12.599
IT'S BETTER
THAN FIGHTING
ALL THE TIME.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.867
I BET YOU WISH
YOU WERE AS CLOSE
TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.570
YOU HAVEN'T
MENTIONED YOUR MOM.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.773
OH, SHE DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.445
YOU DIDN'T TELL
YOUR MOTHER THAT
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.147
NO.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.818
THAT'S KIND OF STRIKING.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.786
AND YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T TELL HER?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.655
NO.

17:35.755 --> 17:40.093
HMM. SO IT WAS A KIND
OF A-- WHAT? --A SECRET

17:40.193 --> 17:42.595
JUST BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU?

17:42.695 --> 17:45.898
WELL, THE THREE OF US,
BECAUSE YOU KNEW.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.367
OKAY.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.270
WERE THERE
ANY OTHER SECRETS?

17:50.370 --> 17:53.106
ALL GIRLS HAVE SECRETS
WITH THEIR DADS.
THAT'S NORMAL.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.243
LIKE-- LIKE WHAT,
FOR EXAMPLE?

18:00.380 --> 18:03.783
WELL, MY DAD LEFT
THE APARTMENT BEFORE
I WOKE UP EVERY DAY

18:03.883 --> 18:06.085
TO GO AND OPEN
THE STORE,

18:06.186 --> 18:09.088
SO I NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM
IN THE MORNINGS.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.325
BUT I WOULD LEAVE EARLY
TO WALK TO SCHOOL--

18:12.425 --> 18:15.628
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
GREENPOINT, BROOKLYN,

18:15.728 --> 18:17.930
EVERYBODY DID THAT THEN.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.299
AND WHERE WAS YOUR MOM?

18:19.399 --> 18:22.602
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY SLEEPING.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.004
--AND I WOULD STOP BY.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.575
IT WAS A CANDY STORE
WITH MAGAZINES,

18:28.675 --> 18:31.211
AND HE WOULD GIVE ME
THIS BIG SMILE

18:31.311 --> 18:33.746
AND THEN HE WOULD MAKE
COFFEE FOR BOTH OF US.

18:35.682 --> 18:39.552
I MEAN MY WAS
PROBABLY MOSTLY MILK,
BUT IT FELT VERY GROWNUP.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.489
AND WE WOULD SIT AND READ
THE PAPER TOGETHER

18:42.589 --> 18:45.858
AND HE ALWAYS TOLD ME
THAT I WAS SMART.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.962
MY MOTHER NEVER KNEW.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.265
THAT WAS A SECRET.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.534
- JUST THE TWO OF YOU?
- MM-HMM.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.672
ONE DAY I WAS
IN THE BACK ROOM

18:59.772 --> 19:03.776
AND THIS MAN CAME IN
TO ROB THE STORE.

19:03.876 --> 19:07.414
AND I WATCHED
AS HE POINTED
A GUN AT MY FATHER.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.583
AND MY FATHER
TOLD HIM TO GET OUT,

19:10.683 --> 19:13.620
THAT HE HAD
EARNED THAT MONEY,

19:13.720 --> 19:15.688
THAT HE WASN'T GOING
TO GIVE HIM A PENNY OF IT

19:15.788 --> 19:17.224
AND THAT HE HAD PRESSED
THE ALARM BUTTON

19:17.324 --> 19:19.058
AND THE POLICE WERE
ON THEIR WAY,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.027
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
WAS A LIE.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.330
HOW-- HOW OLD
WERE YOU?

19:23.430 --> 19:27.166
I WAS IN SECOND GRADE,
SO PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.536
OH, YOU MUST HAVE
BEEN TERRIFIED.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.070
YEAH, I WAS,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.273
BUT I WAS SO--

19:33.373 --> 19:36.509
I WAS SO PROUD OF HIM.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.448
BUT I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO

19:41.548 --> 19:43.883
AND I TRIED
TO CATCH HIS EYE.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.686
HE LOOKED AT ME,

19:46.786 --> 19:48.488
THE ROBBER SAW HIM

19:48.588 --> 19:53.526
AND HE JUST AIMED
HIS GUN STRAIGHT AT ME.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.568
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:01.668 --> 20:04.471
HE YELLED,
"DO YOU WANT
TO LOSE YOUR GIRL?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.205
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?"

20:06.306 --> 20:10.009
AND MY FATHER,
HE JUST EMPTIED
THE REGISTER.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.012
AND I REMEMBER THAT
IT WAS A FRIDAY,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.181
SO THE TILL WAS FULL.

20:15.282 --> 20:18.618
AND THE GUY RAN.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.456
OH, AND MY FATHER,
HE JUST

20:25.091 --> 20:29.195
HE GRABBED ME
AND HE STARTED TO CRY

20:29.296 --> 20:31.364
( stammers )
AND I--

20:31.464 --> 20:33.266
I HADN'T EVER
REALLY SEEN HIM

20:33.366 --> 20:36.002
DO THAT, YOU KNOW.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
HE WAS SHAKING
AND I TOLD HIM--

20:39.372 --> 20:41.908
I SAID, "I'M OKAY.
AND I'M SORRY,

20:42.008 --> 20:45.278
BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T
FOR ME, YOU'D STILL
HAVE YOUR MONEY."

20:46.446 --> 20:47.680
WELL, HE'S HOLDING ME
SO TIGHT--

20:47.780 --> 20:49.782
HE DIDN'T LET ME GO
TO SCHOOL THAT DAY.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.551
HE WOULDN'T LET GO,

20:51.651 --> 20:54.754
AND HE LET ME EAT
MY FAVORITE CHOCOLATES.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.156
AND HE MADE ME PROMISE

20:57.256 --> 20:59.926
NEVER TO TELL
MY MOTHER.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.694
WHY?

21:02.862 --> 21:05.932
WELL, BECAUSE
SHE WOULD'VE BLAMED HIM

21:06.032 --> 21:08.668
FOR LOSING
ALL THAT MONEY,

21:08.768 --> 21:11.704
FOR NOT HAVING A GUN,
FOR NOT HAVING AN ALARM

21:11.804 --> 21:14.240
AND FOR LETTING ME
VISIT HIM IN THE MORNINGS.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.509
( inhales deeply )

21:16.609 --> 21:20.580
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAD
A REALLY CLOSE BOND.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.651
DID THAT MAKE
YOU FEEL... IMPORTANT?

21:24.751 --> 21:28.621
YOU KNOW, MY POOR DAD
IN THAT AWFUL STORE
EVERY DAY--

21:30.423 --> 21:32.792
HE PAID
FOR LAW SCHOOL.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.663
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
IN THAT MEMORY--

21:36.763 --> 21:39.098
THE WAY THAT
HE HELD ONTO YOU,

21:39.198 --> 21:41.468
THE WAY HE CRIED.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.405
- YOU HAD TO STAY
WITH HIM ALL DAY?
- YEAH.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.341
I MEAN, IT WAS
A LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATION.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.543
DID YOU FEEL
THAT MAYBE THERE WAS

21:50.643 --> 21:54.447
A PART OF YOU THAT
COULDN'T LEAVE HIM?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.449
- MAYBE THAT IT FELT--
- YOU KNOW-- NO NO NO.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.651
NO, THAT'S ENOUGH.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.422
I DIDN'T COME
IN HERE FOR THERAPY.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.424
WHICH-- WHICH PART
IS THE THERAPY?

22:04.524 --> 22:06.192
YOU KNOW,
YOUR FATHER, YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR CHILDHOOD--

22:06.292 --> 22:08.361
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.431
- OKAY.
- WHAT I WANT TO TALK--

22:11.531 --> 22:15.134
I WANT A PARTNER
IN MY LIFE.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.169
I WANT A FAMILY
AND A HOME

22:17.269 --> 22:20.072
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,

22:20.172 --> 22:21.674
WHICH IT MAY ALREADY BE.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.876
- I UNDERSTAND.
- CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THAT?

22:23.976 --> 22:26.746
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T WANT
THERAPY, MIA,

22:26.846 --> 22:28.648
BUT YOU'VE COME
TO ME FOR HELP
AND YOU KNOW THERAPY

22:28.748 --> 22:30.717
IS ALL I HAVE
TO OFFER.

22:30.817 --> 22:34.186
I THINK WHAT
WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK
AT THE KIND OF CHOICES

22:34.286 --> 22:36.222
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
MAKING UP TILL NOW

22:36.322 --> 22:38.290
AND WHY
YOU HAVEN'T FOUND--

22:38.391 --> 22:40.627
OKAY, HOW LONG
DOES THAT TAKE?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.662
HOW OLD AM I GOING
TO BE THEN?

22:42.762 --> 22:44.464
I THINK YOU CAME HERE
FOR A REASON, MIA.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.599
NOT JUST TO TALK ABOUT
LAST WEEK OR LAST MONTH.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.234
I THINK
WHAT WE NEED TO DO--

22:48.334 --> 22:50.269
YOU ARE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.639
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.674
DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE
WE'RE IN A SIMILAR POSITION

22:54.774 --> 22:56.643
TO 20 YEARS AGO
WHEN THE CLOCK IS TICKING

22:56.743 --> 22:58.711
AND YOU NEED
TO TAKE ACTION?

22:58.811 --> 23:01.914
I KNOW YOU FEEL
I FAILED YOU BACK THEN--
I KNOW THAT--

23:02.014 --> 23:04.684
BUT IF I OFFER YOU
SOME KIND OF QUICK FIX

23:04.784 --> 23:06.486
THAT YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DELIVER,

23:06.586 --> 23:08.955
IT'S GOING TO END
THE SAME WAY, MIA.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.923
YOU'LL FEEL ANGRY.
YOU'LL FEEL LET DOWN,

23:11.023 --> 23:14.160
LIKE YOU DID BEFORE
AND LIKE YOU DID
WITH BENNETT.

23:14.260 --> 23:17.597
- BENNETT?
- IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE BENNETT WAS

23:17.697 --> 23:19.766
EVER GOING TO GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.835
WHAT HAPPENED WAS PAINFUL
BUT NOT REALLY SURPRISING.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.137
IT WAS ALMOST
SET UP TO FAIL, MIA.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.074
AND IF I WERE TO GO
ALONG WITH YOUR REQUEST
TO FIND YOU A MAN,

23:28.174 --> 23:31.511
- THAT WOULD BE
A SETUP TOO.
- I-- I HAVE TO GO.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.782
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

23:35.882 --> 23:39.051
WELL, I-- I CAN
SEND YOU THE BILL.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.053
OKAY.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.156
YEAH, WHATEVER YOU WANT--
I PROBABLY MAKE MORE
THAN YOU DO AN HOUR,

23:44.256 --> 23:47.794
BUT I HAVE TO
DEAL WITH DOCTORS
AND LAWYERS ALL DAY, SO--

23:48.928 --> 23:50.930
AND YOUR OFFICE IS
NICER THAN MINE.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.665
IT'S HOMEY.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.835
- WELL, THANKS.
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME BACK NEXT WEEK?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.670
WHY?

23:57.770 --> 24:01.874
BECAUSE,
LIKE YOU SAID,
I OWE YOU.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.676
OH. THAT'S--

24:03.776 --> 24:07.046
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.548
WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

24:08.648 --> 24:11.150
OH, I MEANT YOU OWE ME
A CHILD, PAUL.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.220
THAT'S WHAT YOU OWE ME.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.692
( door closes )

24:22.595 --> 24:24.831
( door closes
in distance )

24:26.533 --> 24:28.668
( sighs )

24:57.129 --> 24:59.098
( cassette clattering )

25:07.640 --> 25:09.809
( stereo clicks )

25:12.579 --> 25:15.782
( Cho playing on piano )lude"
