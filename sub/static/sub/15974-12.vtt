-- <i>Casey?</i>
-- Yeah.

01:06:56.015 --> 01:06:56.948
I've made a decision.

01:06:57.016 --> 01:06:57.983
What is it?

01:06:58.050 --> 01:06:59.449
-- It's time.
-- It is?

01:06:59.518 --> 01:07:00.451
It's time.

01:07:00.519 --> 01:07:01.418
Natalie!

01:07:01.487 --> 01:07:03.080
It's absolutely time.

01:07:03.155 --> 01:07:06.022
We've been having some very bizarre
computer problems. Have you noticed that?

01:07:06.091 --> 01:07:07.820
The LC Wire's been getting
numbers wrong.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:08.951
What do you need?

01:07:09.028 --> 01:07:10.996
Messersmith won the gold medal
in the pole vault

01:07:11.063 --> 01:07:12.895
with a leap of 238 feet,
6 inches?

01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:14.194
That doesn't sound right.

01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:16.132
Yeah, it lacks
a ring of truth, yes.

01:07:16.201 --> 01:07:18.101
238 feet, 6 inches
in the pole vault.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.433
That'd be a record,
wouldn't it?

01:07:19.505 --> 01:07:20.597
Yes, it would.

01:07:20.672 --> 01:07:22.071
Elliott!

01:07:23.075 --> 01:07:25.669
-- Why are you staring at me?
-- Because it's time.

01:07:25.744 --> 01:07:27.303
-- It's not time.
-- It <i>is</i> time.

01:07:27.379 --> 01:07:28.972
-- It's past time.
-- It's not past time.

01:07:29.048 --> 01:07:31.278
It's well past time.
You need to start meeting women.

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.011
-- I've met many women.
-- No, you haven't.

01:07:33.085 --> 01:07:35.281
No, you haven't met many women.
That's why I'm here.

01:07:35.354 --> 01:07:36.879
Oh, boy.
I like the sound of this.

01:07:36.955 --> 01:07:39.390
You got married at 23 to a woman
you met when you were 19.

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:40.391
I know. I was there.

01:07:40.459 --> 01:07:41.585
-- So you agree.
-- To what?

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:42.786
You agree that it's time.

01:07:42.861 --> 01:07:44.056
You said it was past time.

01:07:44.129 --> 01:07:45.597
-- Well, it is past time.
-- Then I'm screwed.

01:07:45.664 --> 01:07:46.722

01:07:49.268 --> 01:07:50.861
-- Thank God, indeed.
-- Indeed I do.

-- Do you know why I can help you out?
-- Why?

01:07:53.639 --> 01:07:55.835

<i>The story, Dana,
is shooting percentage.</i>

01:08:09.621 --> 01:08:11.214
Shooting percentage
and offensive glass.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:15.557
Last I checked, UCLA was 12-for-24
from the field, 1-for-6 at the stripe.

01:08:15.627 --> 01:08:18.961
Arizona's press forced 12
turnovers, which led to 15 points.

01:08:19.031 --> 01:08:23.024
The 'oats, needless to say, were dominant
in the paint, and MoDuffy's got four fouls.

01:08:23.102 --> 01:08:24.831

The iron.
You're gonna strike it.

01:08:47.559 --> 01:08:49.323
-- Because it's hot right now?
-- Scorching hot.

01:08:49.394 --> 01:08:50.486

Marsha find me

you needed to see me.</i>

Dana, I need to move my day along
just a little bit faster than this.

01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:31.659
I'm just saying if this is gonna
be bad news, I'd like to sit.

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:33.255
-- Feel free.
-- <i>Thank</i> you.

01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:38.936
I want to start
grooming you.

01:10:39.004 --> 01:10:40.938
-- I don't understand.
-- You heard me.

01:10:41.006 --> 01:10:42.633
-- You want to start grooming me?
-- Yes.

01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:46.110
-- You better be talking about my
hairstyle, Isaac. -- Don't go nuts.

01:10:46.178 --> 01:10:48.875
I am not going nuts, I'm just saying
that's the only kind of grooming

01:10:48.947 --> 01:10:51.439
that I'm prepared to talk about
at this particular moment.

01:10:51.516 --> 01:10:52.449
Was there anything else?

01:10:52.517 --> 01:10:53.814
When the time comes,

01:10:53.885 --> 01:10:56.149
I want the show to go

-- Isaac... -- I'm not
fooling around, Dana.

01:11:00.092 --> 01:11:03.494
Fine. Then we'll have this conversation 15
years from now. ls there anything else?

01:11:03.562 --> 01:11:06.327
You want to be in a position where it's
a smart choice for Luther to make.

01:11:06.398 --> 01:11:07.832
I don't want to
position myself.

01:11:07.899 --> 01:11:10.129
You're gonna start coming to the
monthly lunches at Continental Corp.

01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:11.636

How do you know
I even want your job?

01:11:13.405 --> 01:11:14.566
Everybody wants my job.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.734
Not me.
I think your job stinks.

01:11:16.808 --> 01:11:19.334
You get to create your own show
and make all the decisions

01:11:19.411 --> 01:11:21.436
and have a big staff
and make a lot of money.

01:11:21.513 --> 01:11:22.776
That's not for me, Isaac.

01:11:22.848 --> 01:11:24.942
I like to answer to people.
I don't want to create.

didn't you swear that you
weren't going to leave?

01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:36.527
You did. I remember
you swearing. You swore.

01:11:36.595 --> 01:11:38.085
I'm talking about
down the line.

01:11:38.163 --> 01:11:39.528
-- How far down the line?
-- Far.

01:11:39.598 --> 01:11:41.259
Then stop sending me notes.

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:43.301
Dana, that was a near-death
experience at Christmas.

01:11:43.368 --> 01:11:45.029
I don't think
I've ever seen Luther so mad.

01:11:45.103 --> 01:11:47.834
You embarrassed him on television.
He'll get over it.

01:11:47.906 --> 01:11:49.931
He may get over it, but he
certainly won't forget it.

01:11:50.008 --> 01:11:52.534
<i>Look, he yelled, he screamed,
but he didn't fire you.</i>

01:11:52.611 --> 01:11:54.443
If he was gonna fire you,
he'd have fired you.

01:11:54.513 --> 01:11:56.242
You don't fire
a black executive

01:11:56.315 --> 01:11:58.750
during a race-related
public-relations problem.

01:11:58.817 --> 01:12:00.080
You wait awhile.

01:12:00.152 --> 01:12:02.246
See? That's the kind of thing
I don't know.

01:12:02.321 --> 01:12:04.415
So, you know, stop grooming.

01:12:04.489 --> 01:12:07.083
Start coming with me to the lunches
and to the budget meetings.

01:12:07.159 --> 01:12:08.627
What are you gonna do
if you don't work here?

01:12:08.694 --> 01:12:10.594
I've been thinking a lot
about gardening.

01:12:10.662 --> 01:12:11.788
Gardening?

01:12:11.863 --> 01:12:13.888
I think I'd like to try
organic gardening.

01:12:13.965 --> 01:12:15.194
Do you even know what it is?

01:12:15.267 --> 01:12:17.793
-- No, but I was gonna get a book.
-- Good plan.

01:12:17.869 --> 01:12:19.234
Let's keep this
our little secret.

01:12:19.304 --> 01:12:20.897
I shouldn't tell anyone
that you're grooming me?

01:12:20.972 --> 01:12:22.303
You shouldn't tell anyone
I'm grooming you.

01:12:22.374 --> 01:12:23.398
What if people ask?

01:12:23.475 --> 01:12:24.704
-- Dana...
-- No, I'm serious.

01:12:24.776 --> 01:12:27.108
What if someone asks a direct
question about the grooming?

01:12:27.179 --> 01:12:28.772
-- Dana, I'm serious.
-- All right.

01:12:28.847 --> 01:12:31.908
All right. I won't tell anyone
that you're grooming me.

01:12:31.983 --> 01:12:32.575
Thank you.

01:12:32.651 --> 01:12:34.483

I didn't want to be groomed.

01:12:39.624 --> 01:12:42.924
I said everybody here is very happy
with the jobs they have right now.

01:12:42.994 --> 01:12:43.927

01:12:43.995 --> 01:12:46.089
-- Sure. Yeah.
-- Natalie...

01:12:46.164 --> 01:12:49.225
You're thinking about how you'd redecorate
my office right now, aren't you?

01:12:49.301 --> 01:12:50.632
I was not!

01:12:50.702 --> 01:12:52.966
-- Yes, you were.
-- I was totally not at all.

01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:54.802
In your little mind, you were
measuring for new curtains.

01:12:54.873 --> 01:12:56.432
I was not measuring
for curtains.

01:12:56.508 --> 01:12:58.408
-- You'd keep the curtains?
-- And dump the plants.

01:12:58.477 --> 01:13:00.070
Thank you.

01:13:00.145 --> 01:13:01.579
<i>You are wrong.</i>

-- No, I'm not.
-- You want to make a bet?

I don't want to take
your money.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:06.409
They weren't gonna play
Virginia in the next round.

01:13:06.485 --> 01:13:07.646
They were gonna play
Louisiana Tech.

01:13:07.719 --> 01:13:09.483
You were gonna play
Louisiana Tech.

01:13:09.554 --> 01:13:11.921
No, we were gonna play Clemson.
That's when I injured my ankle.

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:14.857
It was your knee, and it was
against Louisiana Tech.

01:13:14.926 --> 01:13:16.189
Oh.

01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:18.127
This is my ankle.

01:13:20.065 --> 01:13:21.430
No doubt about it.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.662
It was injured
playing Clemson.

01:13:23.735 --> 01:13:25.169
Came out of it okay.

01:13:25.237 --> 01:13:28.138
-- You think? -- Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:28.206 --> 01:13:30.106
-- What have we here?
-- Hello, Dan.

01:13:30.175 --> 01:13:31.665
Sally, put your leg
on the floor.

01:13:31.743 --> 01:13:33.370
I was telling Casey

01:13:33.445 --> 01:13:35.709
that I injured my ankle
against Clemson.

01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:38.443
-- <i>It was your knee.</i>
-- <i>It was my ankle.</i>

01:13:38.517 --> 01:13:41.817
And you see how you were able to tell me
that without taking all your clothes off?

01:13:41.887 --> 01:13:44.549
I just assume you do that
in your head.

01:13:44.623 --> 01:13:46.387
I'll see you later, Casey.

01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:48.620
Dan's gonna want to
warn you about me.

01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:51.228
Bye.

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.388
Bye.

01:13:52.464 --> 01:13:54.455
[indistinct voices]

01:13:58.437 --> 01:14:00.166
What were you just doing?

01:14:00.238 --> 01:14:01.728
Nothing.

01:14:01.807 --> 01:14:03.366
-- You were flirting.
-- No, <i>we</i> weren't.

01:14:03.442 --> 01:14:05.467
-- You were flirting with Sally.
-- I wasn't conscious of it.

01:14:05.544 --> 01:14:08.479
-- Conscious or not, you were doing it.
-- VVas Sally flirting with me?

01:14:08.547 --> 01:14:10.572
Yes, indeed she was.

01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:12.674
I missed the whole thing.

01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:14.219
Thank God I got here
when I did.

01:14:14.286 --> 01:14:15.720
I'm not gonna go out
with Sally.

01:14:15.787 --> 01:14:17.050
You don't have to
go outwith her.

01:14:17.122 --> 01:14:18.556
She was stripping down
right here.

01:14:18.623 --> 01:14:21.058
We were talking about
women's college basketball.

01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:22.890
Oh, Casey, please.

01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:24.861
-- I'm not other people.
-- I know.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.420
And I know I said
it was time,

01:14:26.498 --> 01:14:28.762
but just to be clear about something
-- it's not time for that.

01:14:28.834 --> 01:14:31.360
-- It's not time to dally with Sally.
-- Dan...

01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:33.165
That was an unfortunate
rhyme, but still.

01:14:33.238 --> 01:14:34.433
What's your problem
with Sally?

01:14:34.506 --> 01:14:36.201
Look at her.

01:14:37.576 --> 01:14:40.011
I don't think
she's of this world.

01:14:40.078 --> 01:14:42.410
-- You don't think she's of this world?
-- I do not.

01:14:42.481 --> 01:14:44.074
<i>What world do you think
she's of?</i>

01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:46.083
She scares me.
She's too good-looking.

01:14:46.184 --> 01:14:48.915
Nobody's that good-looking.
I'm not that good-looking.

01:14:48.954 --> 01:14:50.718
Do you really think
she was flirting with me?

01:14:50.789 --> 01:14:53.417
And her beauty comes from
a very strange place.

01:14:53.492 --> 01:14:54.755
Have you noticed that?

01:14:54.826 --> 01:14:57.523
The places her beauty comes from
weren't that strange to me.

01:14:57.596 --> 01:14:59.223
I can identify
almost all of them.

01:14:59.297 --> 01:15:01.391
Don't do it, Casey.
She's got an agenda.

01:15:01.466 --> 01:15:03.230
You think she wants a job
on "Sports Night"?

01:15:03.301 --> 01:15:05.292
No, I think she wants to rule
all of Metropolis.

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:08.772
You see the job she does on “VVest Coast
Update.“ She's a very skilled producer.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.299
Of course she's skilled.
She's Satan's handmaiden.

01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:14.106
She's not Satan's handmaiden.

01:15:14.179 --> 01:15:16.841
On the entire planet, have you ever
seen anyone with eyes like that?

01:15:16.915 --> 01:15:18.781
Huh?
She's a Stepford producer.

01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:20.284
I say
she's a very nice person.

01:15:20.352 --> 01:15:21.979
I say she has no reflection.

01:15:22.053 --> 01:15:23.817
You are worrying
about nothing.

01:15:23.889 --> 01:15:26.722
She wasn't flirting with me,
I wasn't flirting with her.

01:15:28.026 --> 01:15:30.051
It's a well-oiled machine
here.

01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:32.392
I don't want to see anything
interfere with that.

01:15:32.464 --> 01:15:34.489
Did a high school girl
from East Lansing

01:15:34.566 --> 01:15:37.058
run the Boston Marathon
in 2.6 seconds?

01:15:37.135 --> 01:15:38.500
That doesn't sound right.

01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:40.561
Not as well-oiled
as you think.

01:15:46.044 --> 01:15:49.446
[Computer beeping,
keys clicking]

01:15:49.514 --> 01:15:52.108
See?
It says, "-1 SM trunc err."

01:15:52.183 --> 01:15:54.117
You should really call
technical support.

01:15:54.185 --> 01:15:57.246
But I like it when you fix it.
It's so cute and...nerdy.

01:15:57.322 --> 01:15:58.756
I could just lick you up.

01:15:58.823 --> 01:16:00.291
This is
a serious computer problem.

01:16:00.358 --> 01:16:02.588
I don't want to fool around with it.
Call technical support.

01:16:02.661 --> 01:16:03.753
What does "err" mean?

01:16:03.828 --> 01:16:04.795
It means a mistake.

01:16:04.863 --> 01:16:05.921
Is it Latin?

01:16:05.997 --> 01:16:07.021
<i>It's English.</i>

01:16:07.098 --> 01:16:08.964
It's "E-R-R."
It means "error."

01:16:09.034 --> 01:16:11.196
-- Call technical support. -- “-1
SM trunc“ -- what does it mean?

01:16:11.269 --> 01:16:12.532
-- Natalie...
-- Come on!

01:16:12.604 --> 01:16:13.969
Just one.

01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:15.473
[Telephones ringing]

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.009
It means the truncation
indicator alone is wider

01:16:18.076 --> 01:16:19.510
than the specified width.

01:16:19.578 --> 01:16:22.172
It probably also indicates
a -5-type SCP,

01:16:22.247 --> 01:16:24.511
which is
an invalid queue element.

01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:26.449
Okay.

01:16:26.518 --> 01:16:27.952
[Exhales deeply]

01:16:28.019 --> 01:16:30.613
And it says "-15 out of range."
What does that mean?

01:16:30.689 --> 01:16:32.555
That means it's out of range.

01:16:32.624 --> 01:16:34.820
-- Oh, you're not doing this right!
-- What the hell are we doing?

01:16:34.893 --> 01:16:36.884
Well, I thought
we were having phone sex,

01:16:36.962 --> 01:16:39.056
but I guess
you just weren't interested.

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.655
-- We were having phone sex?
-- Well, not phone sex,

01:16:40.732 --> 01:16:42.666
but whatever --
we were having sex.

01:16:42.734 --> 01:16:45.203
-- I didn't even know. -- And frankly,
it showed up in your performance.

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:46.635
I wasn't having sex.

01:16:46.705 --> 01:16:50.005
I know that, Jeremy. I was sitting
here having sex all by myself.

01:16:50.075 --> 01:16:51.236
-- You were having sex.
-- <i>Yes!</i>

01:16:51.309 --> 01:16:52.970
Well, I think maybe
you're not doing it right.

01:16:53.044 --> 01:16:55.570
Call technical support.

01:16:56.748 --> 01:16:57.909
Hello, Isaac.

01:16:57.983 --> 01:16:58.973
Hello, Sally.

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:00.108
Sharp suit.

01:17:00.185 --> 01:17:01.311
Thanks, Sally.

01:17:01.386 --> 01:17:03.013
No, I mean it.
That is a sharp suit.

01:17:03.088 --> 01:17:04.180
Thanks again.

01:17:04.255 --> 01:17:06.223
-- Who makes that suit?
-- Well, I have no idea.

01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:07.486
Is it Armani?

01:17:07.559 --> 01:17:09.084
Uh, no --
honestly, I have no idea.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.423
Could be Hugo Boss.

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:11.621
You never know.

01:17:11.696 --> 01:17:13.460
But either way,
it's a very sharp suit.

01:17:13.531 --> 01:17:15.124
I'm awfully happy with it.
Thanks.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.190
Sure.

01:17:18.436 --> 01:17:19.562

Yes.

What do you want?

01:17:21.806 --> 01:17:23.069
Are you quitting your job?

01:17:23.141 --> 01:17:24.336
-- No.
-- You're not?

01:17:24.409 --> 01:17:25.740
-- No.
-- I heard you were.

01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:28.040
-- You heard wrong. -- I
keep my ear to the ground.

01:17:28.113 --> 01:17:30.241
-- I <i>have</i> no <i>doubt about it.</i>
-- <i>And I'm happy for Dana.</i>

-- She'll be glad to hear it.
-- Can <i>I be</i> blunt?

01:17:32.183 --> 01:17:34.584
As evidence has suggested,
you're capable of it, yes.

01:17:34.653 --> 01:17:36.178
I think I'm the right person
for the job.

01:17:36.254 --> 01:17:37.619
-- Whose job?
-- Dana's <i>job.</i>

01:17:37.689 --> 01:17:40.215
-- Dana wants Dana's job. -- No,
Dana's gonna have your job.

No, sadly,
I'm gonna have my job.

01:17:42.327 --> 01:17:44.159
I want to executive-produce
"Sports Night."

01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:46.926
-- May I give you my credentials?
-- <i>I</i> see no way of <i>stopping</i> you.

01:17:47.032 --> 01:17:50.127
I've been executive producer of
“VVest Coast Update“ for 16 months.

01:17:50.168 --> 01:17:52.262
Our show has never failed
to win its time slot.

01:17:52.337 --> 01:17:54.066
You're on at 2:00 A.M.,
Sally.

01:17:54.139 --> 01:17:57.200
Your competition is a “Bonanza“
rerun and four guys making cheese.

01:17:57.275 --> 01:18:00.210
To say nothing
of Fox on Sports and CNN/SI,

01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:04.112
both of which were on top of us to the
tune of a share point before I came in.

01:18:04.182 --> 01:18:05.980
My shows are tight,
my shows are hot,

01:18:06.051 --> 01:18:08.611
and my shows are paced to
within an inch of their lives.

01:18:08.687 --> 01:18:12.123
My staff is professional, and <i>they</i>
place a premium on professionalism.

01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:13.817
My staff is professional,
Sally.

01:18:13.892 --> 01:18:18.056
As we speak, one of your LC
wireframes is misprocessing data

01:18:18.129 --> 01:18:20.894
while two of your associate
producers stand over the monitor,

01:18:20.965 --> 01:18:22.490
attempting to have phone sex.

01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:24.331
God, people don't tell me
which two.

01:18:24.402 --> 01:18:25.961
Just think about it.

01:18:26.037 --> 01:18:28.233
All right. My guess is
it's Jeremy and Natalie.

01:18:28.306 --> 01:18:30.604
I meant think about me
for the job.

01:18:30.675 --> 01:18:31.608
-- Dana's job.
-- Yes.

01:18:31.676 --> 01:18:33.940
-- When Dana takes my job.
-- Yes.

01:18:34.012 --> 01:18:35.275
<i>And tell me again
what I'll be doing.</i>

01:18:35.346 --> 01:18:36.438
I heard organic gardening.

-- You can leave now.
-- <i>Sharp suit.</i>

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:39.675

<i>Good evening.

01:18:44.989 --> 01:18:46.923
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

01:18:46.991 --> 01:18:49.653
Those stories, plus we've got
a major league baseball trade

01:18:49.728 --> 01:18:52.425
that brought some birds home
to roost.

01:18:52.497 --> 01:18:54.761
-- [Snaps fingers] That's you.
-- What?

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:58.633
<i>Major league baseball trade that brought some
birds home to roost, and then you say...</i>

01:18:58.703 --> 01:19:00.137
Yoko Ono.

01:19:00.205 --> 01:19:01.798
-- Really?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:19:01.873 --> 01:19:03.864
Okay, but it might be better
to say something about hockey.

01:19:03.942 --> 01:19:06.104
-- I'm gonna fix you up with Yoko Ono.
-- <i>I</i> don't think so.

01:19:06.177 --> 01:19:08.612
-- <i>Yeah.</i> I really <i>am.</i>
-- <i>No, you're really not.</i>

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.274
-- Are you concerned about the age
difference? -- Do you even know Yoko Ono?

01:19:11.349 --> 01:19:13.317
I'm a fan of her music, yes.

01:19:13.384 --> 01:19:16.547
A major league baseball trade that
brought some birds home to roost.

01:19:16.621 --> 01:19:19.283
You can get away with that if you want,
but it's not “birds,“ it's “ohiokens.“

01:19:19.357 --> 01:19:20.825
Do you really think
Dana was flirting with me?

01:19:20.892 --> 01:19:21.984
-- Dana?
-- Sally.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.323
You said Dana.

01:19:23.394 --> 01:19:25.192
-- I <i>meant</i> Sally.
-- <i>Stop thinking about Sally.</i>

01:19:25.263 --> 01:19:26.856
I'm not thinking about Sally.

01:19:26.931 --> 01:19:28.865
This is science fiction.

01:19:28.933 --> 01:19:31.868
I'm all alone on this.
I stand completely alone.

01:19:31.936 --> 01:19:34.871
Sally is an alien.
Do you understand me?

01:19:34.939 --> 01:19:38.500
At night she peels off her body and
lives on Steve Guttenburg's boat.

01:19:38.576 --> 01:19:41.978
-- And you can't get anybody to rally around
that theory? -- My point is, you said Dana.

01:19:42.046 --> 01:19:43.241
Hey, pigeons roost,
don't they?

01:19:43.314 --> 01:19:45.214
-- Yes. -- So what's
wrong with “birds“?

01:19:45.283 --> 01:19:48.014
What's wrong with the unmistakable
human frailty of Yoko Ono?

01:19:48.052 --> 01:19:49.645
Uh, Dana?

01:19:49.721 --> 01:19:51.155
You're still 1:20 fat
in the 40s.

01:19:51.222 --> 01:19:53.691
We're getting there. Can I say,
“Birds come home to roost“?

01:19:53.758 --> 01:19:55.283
Yeah, I saw that.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.953
-- Can I say it?
-- It's "chickens."

01:19:57.028 --> 01:19:58.518
Well, I think
it's also pigeons.

01:19:58.596 --> 01:20:00.428
[Telephone ringing]
Do pigeons roost?

01:20:00.498 --> 01:20:02.193
-- I think they do.
-- I think they perch.

01:20:02.267 --> 01:20:03.200
I think they roost.

01:20:03.268 --> 01:20:05.259
Look, it's fine with me.

01:20:05.336 --> 01:20:07.134
Hey, you know what?

01:20:07.205 --> 01:20:09.640
I think someone was flirting
with me today.

01:20:09.707 --> 01:20:10.936
I'm sorry?

01:20:11.009 --> 01:20:13.307
Someone might have been
flirting with me today.

01:20:13.378 --> 01:20:14.311
Sally?

01:20:14.379 --> 01:20:15.346
How did you know?

01:20:15.413 --> 01:20:17.074
Sally's always flirting
with you.

01:20:17.148 --> 01:20:19.082
-- No, she's not.
-- Yes, she is.

01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:20.743
It's okay.

01:20:20.819 --> 01:20:22.810
I wasn't flirting back.

01:20:22.887 --> 01:20:24.651
You're kind of feeble,
aren't you?

01:20:24.722 --> 01:20:26.383
-- Well, have I?
-- I really don't know.

01:20:26.457 --> 01:20:29.222
-- I don't want to look foolish.
-- Not much chance of that.

01:20:29.294 --> 01:20:31.626
Do I flirt badly?

01:20:31.696 --> 01:20:33.130
-- You flirt fine.
-- Seriously.

01:20:33.198 --> 01:20:34.461
-- You flirt fine.
-- Dana...

01:20:34.532 --> 01:20:36.432
Flirt with me now.

Yes.

01:20:38.837 --> 01:20:40.271
I will.

01:20:40.338 --> 01:20:42.067
Start.

01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:44.433
How you doin'?

01:20:44.509 --> 01:20:45.670
[Laughs]

01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:48.075
That's good, Casey.
How many years of college?

01:20:48.146 --> 01:20:49.705
I've got more.
I'm just saying hi.

01:20:49.781 --> 01:20:51.772
Lay it on me.

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:53.443
What's your name?

01:20:53.518 --> 01:20:55.452
Casey,
I'm saying flirt with me.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.249
I'm not playing
somebody else.

01:20:57.322 --> 01:20:59.051
-- You're not helping.
-- Start again.

01:20:59.123 --> 01:21:01.148
Flirt with me.

01:21:01.226 --> 01:21:03.752

What's your name?

01:21:07.899 --> 01:21:11.199
My name's Dana, you unbelievable moron.
You've known me for 15 years.

01:21:11.269 --> 01:21:12.862
Flirt with me.

01:21:12.937 --> 01:21:15.269
Tell me why you like me
better than Sally.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.104
I do like you better
than Sally.

01:21:17.175 --> 01:21:19.234
-- Tell me why.
-- I don't understand.

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:21.301
I don't think you're ever
going to have sex again.

01:21:21.379 --> 01:21:22.972
<i>L</i> got to g0-

01:21:23.047 --> 01:21:25.311
You're smoky.

01:21:25.383 --> 01:21:27.078
I'm sorry?

01:21:27.151 --> 01:21:29.347
The difference between you
and Sally -- you're smoky.

01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.785
I'm smoky?

01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:32.254
You're smoky.

01:21:32.323 --> 01:21:34.348
You're a lot of other things,
too, but you're smoky.

01:21:34.425 --> 01:21:37.952
I don't know what that means, but I like
the sound of it. Tell me what it means.

01:21:38.029 --> 01:21:40.088
-- No, it's hard to translate.
-- Try.

01:21:40.164 --> 01:21:41.290
You'll make a joke.

01:21:41.366 --> 01:21:43.164
We're flirting.
It's okay.

01:21:43.234 --> 01:21:44.998
Are we really flirting,

01:21:45.069 --> 01:21:48.039
or are you just pretending to be you
flirting with me actually being me?

01:21:48.106 --> 01:21:49.631
You think I'm smoky?

01:21:49.707 --> 01:21:52.699
Classy, impressive,
sexy --

01:21:52.777 --> 01:21:54.040
Was sexy going too far?

01:21:54.112 --> 01:21:56.137
L-It was fine.

01:21:56.214 --> 01:21:57.773
You're smoky.

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:00.614
Thank you.

01:22:02.086 --> 01:22:03.178
Uh, Natalie, wait up.

01:22:03.254 --> 01:22:05.018
I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to Natalie.

<i>Uh...</i>
[Bottle clatters]

01:22:07.358 --> 01:22:08.348
That's fine.

01:22:08.426 --> 01:22:10.155
We're on the air
in very...soon,

01:22:10.228 --> 01:22:11.389
and...Natalie's there.

01:22:11.462 --> 01:22:12.725
-- Okay.
-- So...

01:22:12.797 --> 01:22:15.232
-- I'll see you later. -- Yeah.
In just a little bit, in fact.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.394
-- 'Cause we're going on the air. --
And you're okay with birds roosting?

01:22:17.468 --> 01:22:21.063
I'm okay with...birds doing
anything you tell them to.

01:22:21.139 --> 01:22:23.631
[indistinct voices]

01:22:26.244 --> 01:22:27.575
Were you two flirting?

01:22:27.645 --> 01:22:28.840
-- No.
-- You were.

01:22:28.913 --> 01:22:32.042
We were, but it was
a rehearsal of sorts.

01:22:32.116 --> 01:22:33.880
It was a...class.

01:22:33.952 --> 01:22:36.387
If you guys aren't too far
along, could Jeremy join?

01:22:36.454 --> 01:22:37.615
Sure.

<i>Isaac, you got a minute?</i>

01:22:46.197 --> 01:22:47.892

[Exhales deeply]

01:22:49.767 --> 01:22:51.394
I'm a team player, Isaac.

01:22:51.469 --> 01:22:53.369
Always have been,
always will be.

01:22:53.438 --> 01:22:56.931
<i>But everyone here moves up one notch and
you make this woman senior associate,</i>

01:22:57.008 --> 01:23:00.239
I'll lead a mutiny the likes of
which will sink this show for good.

01:23:00.311 --> 01:23:01.938
Okay.

01:23:02.013 --> 01:23:03.174
Kim?

01:23:03.247 --> 01:23:05.909
When I get Natalie's job,
is there a union regulation

01:23:05.984 --> 01:23:08.112
that prevents me from making
Elliott my man slave?

01:23:08.186 --> 01:23:09.847
All right. That's it.

01:23:09.921 --> 01:23:11.252
Follow me.

-- Let's just forget about it.
-- I'm saying it right now!

Far be it from me to be
adventuresome in our sex life!

Thanks very much, folks.
Be sure and tip your waitresses.

as well?

01:23:33.244 --> 01:23:34.336
What are we doing?

01:23:34.412 --> 01:23:35.675
We're having
a little meeting.

01:23:35.747 --> 01:23:38.910

-- Probably not.

My name is Isaac Jaffee.
I run this place.

Anybody else who runs this
place, please raise your hand.

01:23:53.197 --> 01:23:54.790
Good.
Couple of things.

01:23:54.866 --> 01:23:57.062
I am not quitting,
and I am not getting fired,

01:23:57.135 --> 01:23:59.069
at least not today
and probably not tomorrow.

01:23:59.137 --> 01:24:00.502
Let me add, Dana,

<i>that things that I say

Jeremy's my boyfriend.
He's the only one I told.

01:24:09.814 --> 01:24:12.442
I told many, many people.

01:24:18.389 --> 01:24:20.255
Elliott, Kim,

<i>the production team is,
in fact, a team,</i>

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.355
and you will work with and for
whomever Dana tells you to.

-- Thank you.
-- Shut up.

01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:29.093
Okay.

01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.532
Finally, I'd like to say

01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:32.433
that while there are
many programs here at CSC,

01:24:32.503 --> 01:24:34.471
and there's nothing wrong
with healthy competition,

01:24:34.539 --> 01:24:36.007
we are all a family,

with professional respect.

Those stories, plus
a major league baseball trade

that brought some birds
home to roost.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.466
The ACC was the place to be
in college hoops last night,

01:26:19.544 --> 01:26:21.137
