02:47.407 --> 02:49.325
Come on, Peter.

02:50.078 --> 02:53.082
Wake up. Peter. Wake up.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.934
Here's your suit.

03:00.153 --> 03:02.855
Do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night?

03:04.328 --> 03:05.429
I don't know.

03:08.369 --> 03:09.855
Come on, Peter. Get up.

03:32.443 --> 03:35.756
Oh, Charlie.
For God's sake, come on!

03:38.173 --> 03:40.143
It was freezing last night!

03:40.513 --> 03:42.238
That's how you get pneumonia.

03:42.419 --> 03:43.795
That's okay.

03:44.069 --> 03:46.269
Okay, come on.
Let's go. We're late.

03:46.318 --> 03:48.119
Your mother's
in the car already.

03:58.748 --> 04:00.993
Um...

04:01.998 --> 04:07.064
It's heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today.

04:07.846 --> 04:11.863
Um, I know my mom
would be very touched

04:12.267 --> 04:15.038
and probably a little
suspicious...

04:15.210 --> 04:18.930
um, to see this turnout. So.

04:22.990 --> 04:27.495
My mother was a very secretive
and private woman.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.536
She had private rituals,

04:29.622 --> 04:32.626
private friends,
private anxieties.

04:33.282 --> 04:34.698
It honestly feels
like a betrayal

04:34.700 --> 04:36.950
just to be standing here
talking about her.

04:43.758 --> 04:46.361
<i>She was a very difficult woman
to read.</i>

04:47.286 --> 04:50.172
<i>If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her,</i>

04:50.213 --> 04:52.549
<i>and God forbid
you tried to confront that.</i>

04:56.407 --> 04:57.792
<i>But when her life
was unpolluted,</i>

04:57.862 --> 05:00.298
<i>she could be
the sweetest, warmest,</i>

05:00.346 --> 05:02.353
<i>most loving person
in the world.</i>

05:04.116 --> 05:06.107
She was also
incredibly stubborn,

05:06.156 --> 05:08.713
which maybe, explains me.

05:10.729 --> 05:13.332
You could always count on her
to always have the answer.

05:14.871 --> 05:17.401
And if she ever was mistaken,

05:17.461 --> 05:19.710
and well,
that was your opinion...

05:19.745 --> 05:24.562
And you were wrong.

05:48.085 --> 05:49.763
There aren't nuts in that?

05:50.279 --> 05:51.747
- No.
- Good.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.129
Does that have nuts? 'Cause
we don't have the EpiPen.

05:55.131 --> 05:56.143
I know.

06:23.833 --> 06:27.923
Hello, Rexy! Good dog.

06:27.969 --> 06:29.534
Shoes off, everybody.

06:29.828 --> 06:32.093
Charlie, shoes off.

06:40.325 --> 06:41.763
It does feel weird.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.331
Yeah.

06:45.759 --> 06:47.181
Should I be sadder?

06:47.976 --> 06:51.659
You should be
whatever you are. It'll come.

07:13.242 --> 07:15.249
Hey, how's it going?

07:15.383 --> 07:16.993
Mmm, just working.

07:18.053 --> 07:20.381
Taking a break
from avoiding the show.

07:25.385 --> 07:29.312
So, you still toiling away
at the hospice?

07:29.720 --> 07:32.456
Yeah, between this
and the, uh, preschool.

07:34.267 --> 07:37.252
So what's our deadline now?
Seven months?

07:37.819 --> 07:40.589
- Six and a half.
- Ooh, coming up.

07:42.105 --> 07:43.941
Any ideas for titles?

07:51.748 --> 07:52.783
Come in.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.955
Hey...

07:55.139 --> 07:57.107
- Goodnight, kiddo.
- Goodnight.

07:59.857 --> 08:03.264
Are you, uh... Are you feeling
okay about everything?

08:03.350 --> 08:05.226
Yeah. Fine.

08:05.975 --> 08:07.342
A little sad?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.694
Mmm...

08:10.791 --> 08:13.921
Yeah, I get it. I know.

08:14.242 --> 08:15.901
- Goodnight.
- Night.

08:15.957 --> 08:17.258
Love you.

08:32.453 --> 08:33.488
Who's this?

08:36.173 --> 08:37.506
That's Grandma?

08:48.423 --> 08:50.488
You know
you were her favorite, right?

08:52.029 --> 08:53.931
Even when
you were a little baby,

08:53.933 --> 08:54.656
she wouldn't let me feed you

08:54.658 --> 08:56.330
because she needed
to feed you.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.046
Drove me crazy.

08:59.070 --> 09:01.080
She wanted me to be a boy.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.082
You know, I was a tomboy
when I was growing up.

09:08.646 --> 09:12.909
I hated dresses
and dolls and pink.

09:14.703 --> 09:16.538
Who's gonna take care of me?

09:16.755 --> 09:19.696
Um, excuse me.

09:19.698 --> 09:21.797
You don't think
I'm gonna take care of you?

09:23.210 --> 09:24.758
But when you die.

09:27.766 --> 09:29.039
Well, then...

09:30.117 --> 09:31.818
Dad will take care of you.

09:33.076 --> 09:34.463
Or Peter.

09:51.238 --> 09:53.040
You never cried as a baby.

09:54.911 --> 09:56.412
You know that?

09:58.133 --> 09:59.902
Even when you were born.

10:08.922 --> 10:11.019
Did you feel
like you wanted to cry today?

10:16.122 --> 10:18.292
You think it might feel
like a relief?

10:43.646 --> 10:45.049
Goodnight, sweetheart.

12:37.005 --> 12:38.252
Mom?

13:19.092 --> 13:21.262
I just scared myself
in the workshop.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.851
With... With what?

13:30.025 --> 13:31.094
No.

13:52.976 --> 13:54.144
Are you done?

13:56.079 --> 13:57.314
Almost.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.996
So, maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz.

14:02.077 --> 14:03.244
What do you think?

14:05.202 --> 14:06.697
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:15.298 --> 14:17.703
Oh, my God! What was that?

14:31.257 --> 14:33.007
So, if we go by the rule

14:33.061 --> 14:36.417
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw,

14:36.468 --> 14:39.039
what is Heracles' flaw?

14:40.235 --> 14:41.437
Arrogance.

14:41.491 --> 14:44.029
Okay. Why?

14:44.447 --> 14:47.217
Because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs

14:47.273 --> 14:50.179
that are literally handed
to him the entire play.

14:50.746 --> 14:52.857
Okay, interesting.

14:52.908 --> 14:55.169
So he thinks he has control.

14:55.245 --> 14:56.668
But let's all remember,

14:56.747 --> 14:59.802
Sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional,

14:59.865 --> 15:03.831
meaning, Heracles never had
any choice, right?

15:03.900 --> 15:06.727
So does that make it
more tragic or less tragic

15:06.783 --> 15:09.036
that if he has a choice?

15:09.106 --> 15:11.081
- Less.
- Okay.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.081
- Why?
- Because.

15:15.884 --> 15:17.652
Care to weigh in, Peter?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.347
Um, about which part?

15:23.599 --> 15:24.689
I think it's more tragic

15:24.691 --> 15:26.467
because if it's all
just inevitable,

15:26.469 --> 15:28.888
then that means that
the characters had no hope.

15:28.997 --> 15:29.798
They never had hope

15:29.800 --> 15:31.688
because they're all just,
like, hopeless.

15:31.787 --> 15:32.649
They're all like pawns

15:32.651 --> 15:35.209
in this horrible,
hopeless machine.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.211
- Hello!
- Hi!

17:33.671 --> 17:35.206
Did you go up
in my mom's room?

17:36.451 --> 17:37.585
No.

17:38.371 --> 17:40.172
Mmm. Door was open.

17:46.186 --> 17:47.186
Hello?

17:47.218 --> 17:48.800
Sorry. I know it's irrational.

17:48.864 --> 17:50.566
- No problem.
- Thank you.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.718
Hey, Dad. It's the cemetery.

17:54.033 --> 17:55.169
About what?

17:56.027 --> 17:57.227
Let me see.

17:57.927 --> 18:00.647
Hello? Yes.

18:07.918 --> 18:09.418
What does that mean?

18:10.166 --> 18:11.502
Desecrated?

18:16.070 --> 18:17.773
But it's only been a week.

18:21.198 --> 18:24.151
Yes, okay, yes. Sure.

18:24.282 --> 18:25.723
All right. I understand.
Yes...

18:25.779 --> 18:28.688
Uh, why don't I call you back?
Yes. Goodbye.

18:28.729 --> 18:29.865
What was it?

18:31.717 --> 18:34.138
Uh, just some billing crap.

18:35.422 --> 18:37.846
Okay, well, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna go see a movie.

18:38.974 --> 18:40.080
Okay.

19:07.553 --> 19:08.265
He would say,

19:08.267 --> 19:11.635
"I'm a burden, I'm a burden,
I'm a burden."

19:15.789 --> 19:18.082
And I would tell him, "No, no."

19:25.049 --> 19:27.958
But yes, he was a burden.

19:28.663 --> 19:31.774
Now we've set aside
some time for any newcomers

19:31.826 --> 19:33.611
who might like to speak.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.387
So, anyone.

19:35.448 --> 19:38.854
If it's your first
or second time with us,

19:38.893 --> 19:40.495
the floor is open.

19:44.209 --> 19:47.103
Yes. Would you like to...

19:47.171 --> 19:48.413
Maybe not.

19:48.878 --> 19:51.699
Okay. No pressure.

19:59.354 --> 20:00.488
My name's Annie.

20:00.715 --> 20:02.021
Hi, Annie.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.562
My mom died a week ago.

20:05.853 --> 20:09.043
So I'm just here
for trying it.

20:10.102 --> 20:12.639
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,

20:12.757 --> 20:15.798
but I came to these
a couple years ago.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.950
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...

20:20.368 --> 20:22.339
I guess it helped. So, um...

20:25.330 --> 20:28.925
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.353
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,

20:31.355 --> 20:34.279
so it really wasn't
a huge blow.

20:34.572 --> 20:39.817
But I did love her.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.701
And she didn't have
an easy life.

20:42.752 --> 20:45.891
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.

20:46.110 --> 20:47.577
And dementia.

20:47.679 --> 20:51.717
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,

20:51.799 --> 20:54.619
um, because he had
psychotic depression

20:54.689 --> 20:55.417
and he starved himself,

20:55.419 --> 20:57.687
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.

20:57.744 --> 20:59.278
And then there's my brother.

20:59.428 --> 21:01.330
My older brother
had schizophrenia

21:01.394 --> 21:02.661
and when he was 16

21:02.701 --> 21:04.438
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom

21:04.500 --> 21:06.150
and of course
the suicide note blamed her

21:06.186 --> 21:09.590
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.

21:13.336 --> 21:15.272
That was my mom's life.

21:27.742 --> 21:28.974
And then she lived
in our house

21:28.976 --> 21:30.691
at the end before hospice.

21:30.727 --> 21:32.247
We weren't even talking
before that.

21:32.315 --> 21:34.312
I mean, we were
and then we weren't.

21:34.601 --> 21:36.208
And then we were.

21:39.117 --> 21:40.674
She's completely manipulative.

21:40.710 --> 21:44.099
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,

21:44.157 --> 21:46.422
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.

21:46.517 --> 21:47.589
I didn't let her
anywhere near me

21:47.591 --> 21:49.245
when I had my first, my son,

21:49.298 --> 21:51.114
which is why I gave her
my daughter,

21:51.116 --> 21:53.580
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.

21:53.956 --> 21:56.676
And I just...
I felt guilty again.

21:56.719 --> 21:58.158
I felt guilty again.

21:58.415 --> 21:59.458
When she got sick,

21:59.460 --> 22:01.701
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,

22:01.703 --> 22:06.342
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.

22:10.949 --> 22:14.500
And I just don't want to put
any more stress on my family.

22:16.810 --> 22:19.134
I'm not even really sure
if they could...

22:20.713 --> 22:22.548
Could give me that support.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.881
And I just...
I just feel like...

22:31.387 --> 22:33.445
I just sometimes
feel like it's all ruined.

22:36.245 --> 22:40.418
And then I realize
that I am to blame.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.063
Or not that I'm to blame,

22:44.108 --> 22:48.881
but I am blamed! I'm...

22:50.069 --> 22:53.756
And what do you think
you feel blamed for?

22:57.116 --> 22:58.482
I don't know.

23:02.503 --> 23:03.647
<i>Hey, what's going on in town</i>

23:03.649 --> 23:05.468
<i>anyway, Mister?
A convention or something?</i>

23:05.470 --> 23:06.178
<i>What?</i>

23:06.180 --> 23:07.410
<i>Well, those clothes
you're wearing.</i>

23:07.412 --> 23:08.388
<i>I talked to a guy this morning</i>

23:08.390 --> 23:10.355
<i>who was wearing
the same kind of outfit.</i>

23:10.472 --> 23:12.747
<i>Maybe it's the guy
you're looking for, huh?</i>

23:12.749 --> 23:14.116
<i>You spoke to him?</i>

23:14.467 --> 23:16.486
<i>What did he tell you?
Where did he go?</i>

23:16.558 --> 23:17.883
<i>Hey, what's the matter
with you?</i>

23:17.907 --> 23:19.124
<i>Hey, take your hands off me.</i>

23:19.148 --> 23:20.642
<i>You will tell me
what he said to you!</i>

23:20.666 --> 23:21.698
<i>Well why should I?</i>

23:21.749 --> 23:23.349
<i>Hey, who do you think
you are anyway?</i>

23:25.524 --> 23:26.924
<i>He came in
with the dog tags!</i>

23:27.031 --> 23:28.197
<i>Wanted to know
about the address</i>

23:28.199 --> 23:29.408
<i>and I told him how to find it.</i>

23:29.448 --> 23:30.449
Where?

25:35.511 --> 25:39.169
Hey, um, do you think
I could maybe borrow

25:39.171 --> 25:40.705
one of the cars tonight?

25:40.965 --> 25:43.392
Why? Where are you going?

25:43.569 --> 25:46.303
Oh, just like
a school barbecue thing.

25:46.518 --> 25:48.289
Oh, so you're not eating
with us?

25:48.452 --> 25:50.174
No, I was still gonna
eat here.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.715
Well, you can eat there
if you want. I just didn't...

25:51.717 --> 25:54.339
No, no, no. I'm gonna
eat here. I just, I...

25:54.394 --> 25:57.097
Just be going to hang out.

25:59.682 --> 26:00.884
No drinking?

26:02.407 --> 26:05.445
We're not even old enough
to get drinks if we wanted to.

26:05.752 --> 26:08.621
Well, that's a crock. I'm just
asking if you're drinking.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.669
Well, I just answered no.

26:12.414 --> 26:14.093
You gonna take your sister?

26:15.595 --> 26:18.454
Uh... Does she want to go?

26:19.087 --> 26:21.756
Have you asked her?

26:25.443 --> 26:26.611
Charlie?

26:57.021 --> 26:58.101
Charlie!

27:00.217 --> 27:04.427
I mean, what are you doing?
Leaving the house barefoot?

27:04.625 --> 27:05.649
Are you some kind of idiot?

27:05.651 --> 27:08.358
You can't roam around
with no shoes and no coat.

27:08.528 --> 27:10.294
- I want Grandma.
- Oh.

27:10.902 --> 27:13.428
Oh, what?
You're angry with me now?

27:16.837 --> 27:19.276
You are going to this...
Hey, socks off.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.219
You're going to this party
with your brother.

27:21.883 --> 27:22.819
What party?

27:22.821 --> 27:25.532
Some school hangout
with other kids.

27:27.148 --> 27:27.867
That's okay.

27:27.869 --> 27:30.990
No, it's not okay.
You're going.

27:31.114 --> 27:32.586
- Why?
- Because it'll be fun.

27:32.642 --> 27:34.574
Because you'll get to hang out
with other kids.

27:34.637 --> 27:35.850
- With who?
- With your...

27:35.902 --> 27:37.602
With your brother.
With other kids.

27:42.940 --> 27:44.524
- Fine.
- Good. You're going.

27:44.556 --> 27:46.559
- She's going with you.
- Great.

27:46.613 --> 27:48.455
Now this really means
no drinking.

27:48.524 --> 27:50.293
Yeah, I really wasn't
going to.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.144
<i>Whoa. Hi.</i>

29:29.571 --> 29:30.873
Oh. Hi.

29:31.533 --> 29:32.868
How's the party?

29:34.069 --> 29:36.232
Why? You wanna know
if you should come?

29:36.629 --> 29:38.643
Uh, yeah. What do ya think?

29:41.108 --> 29:42.443
Either way.

29:45.096 --> 29:47.465
Hey, do you happen
to smoke at all?

29:47.505 --> 29:49.140
I have really good weed.

29:55.554 --> 29:57.823
- The other room has a bong.
- Sick.

30:03.363 --> 30:04.902
Do you wanna wait out here
for a second?

30:04.926 --> 30:06.967
- No.
- Charlie, please, just...

30:07.032 --> 30:08.852
It'll be two minutes
and then we can hang out.

30:08.918 --> 30:11.866
You can draw.
Please, Charlie. I'm...

30:13.472 --> 30:15.610
Oh, shit, look. They're
giving out chocolate cake.

30:15.612 --> 30:16.869
Not to everyone.

30:16.871 --> 30:18.210
Yes to everyone. It's a party.

30:18.257 --> 30:20.252
- I don't know anyone.
- Nobody does.

30:20.307 --> 30:23.061
Just walk over and stand there
and they'll give you a piece.

30:23.118 --> 30:25.078
Hurry up. They're gonna
run out. Come on, Charlie.

30:30.762 --> 30:34.167
Hey, guys. Peter has weed.

30:58.063 --> 30:59.701
That was your sister downstairs?

31:00.014 --> 31:02.041
Yeah. Charlie.

31:03.964 --> 31:05.232
Is your sister hot?

31:08.035 --> 31:10.025
I actually saw her
drawing me last week.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.157
Oh, yeah?

31:11.225 --> 31:13.951
Yeah. She made me
look retarded.

31:14.256 --> 31:15.622
Yeah. That's Charlie.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.403
Peter?

31:46.592 --> 31:49.462
Charlie.

31:49.815 --> 31:52.085
What's up?

31:56.485 --> 31:57.787
Are you okay?

31:59.386 --> 32:01.256
It's hard to breathe.

32:02.918 --> 32:03.985
What do you mean?

32:05.179 --> 32:07.307
I think my throat's
getting bigger.

32:56.734 --> 32:58.894
It's okay, Charlie.
We're almost at the hospital, okay?

33:16.878 --> 33:18.880
Charlie!

34:38.793 --> 34:40.117
You okay.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.380
Okay.

35:52.622 --> 35:54.688
Okay, good. They're home.

35:55.351 --> 35:56.418
Good.

36:53.427 --> 36:55.587
I'm running out
for some balsam wood.

36:55.589 --> 36:56.815
You want anything?

36:56.861 --> 36:59.317
I'm good, sweetheart.
Drive safe.

36:59.372 --> 37:01.998
Okay. Back in 20.

37:39.563 --> 37:43.020
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

37:47.648 --> 37:51.834
Oh, no. I can't, I can't...

37:51.964 --> 37:57.378
I just want to die!

38:03.443 --> 38:06.152
Oh, God. It hurts too much!

38:06.154 --> 38:08.292
I just need to die!

38:12.881 --> 38:16.243
Charlie!

38:20.322 --> 38:24.185
Oh, God.

38:30.258 --> 38:33.469
Oh, Charlie!

42:06.125 --> 42:08.667
Hey, are you guys friends
with Becky on Facebook?

42:09.269 --> 42:10.971
You're friends with Becky?

42:11.558 --> 42:14.096
I said "Facebook friends."

42:15.017 --> 42:16.813
But seriously,
you see her statuses, bro?

42:16.815 --> 42:18.602
Oh, my God, dude, I know.

42:18.649 --> 42:21.136
- Like, every ten seconds.
- For real.

42:21.182 --> 42:24.937
Oh, dude, what about, uh,
fucking... Let me hit that.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.070
- Brian?
- Brian and his girlfriend.

42:27.143 --> 42:28.379
He calls her something...

42:28.426 --> 42:30.546
He calls her something really
goofy, dude. What does he...

42:30.570 --> 42:31.668
Oh, he calls her princess.

42:34.367 --> 42:36.460
Who fucking calls
their girlfriend "princess"?

42:36.509 --> 42:38.175
What the fuck?

42:38.229 --> 42:39.011
Dude, he's like,

42:39.042 --> 42:41.742
"I'm picking up
my princess from the airport.

42:41.797 --> 42:44.001
Fucking eating cous...
What the fuck.

42:44.064 --> 42:44.831
It's couscous.

42:44.880 --> 42:48.017
Couscous. I don't give a shit,
"...with my princess."

42:48.072 --> 42:49.352
You hit that shit?

42:49.402 --> 42:50.509
Who's his girlfriend?

42:50.565 --> 42:54.031
Some, uh, some fucking
stupid college chick.

42:55.289 --> 42:56.289
Oh, damn.

42:56.328 --> 42:58.711
I wanna fucking stupid
college princess, bro.

42:58.782 --> 43:00.491
Yeah.

43:00.555 --> 43:02.293
Oh, hey dude.
Dude, dude, dude.

43:02.353 --> 43:03.513
Are you... Are you all right?

43:06.251 --> 43:08.920
I think I'm having a...
Like a reaction.

43:09.502 --> 43:10.503
My throat is...

43:10.585 --> 43:12.340
I think my throat
is getting bigger.

43:12.740 --> 43:16.012
Dude, it's just it's...
It's just weed.

43:16.197 --> 43:17.918
Chill, man. It's all right.

43:18.091 --> 43:19.873
Just hold my hand. Hold on.

44:56.691 --> 45:00.083
Uh, I'm so sorry
to chase you down.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.732
Uh, were you not
coming in, or...

45:03.414 --> 45:06.735
I... No, I just, um...
I forgot something.

45:06.788 --> 45:09.676
Oh, okay, sorry.
Sorry, I just...

45:09.721 --> 45:12.251
I recognized you
from a few months ago.

45:13.124 --> 45:16.866
Oh, God.
I feel very silly. I'm Joan.

45:18.129 --> 45:19.465
Hi.

45:19.521 --> 45:21.129
Are you doing better?

45:22.306 --> 45:24.841
- What?
- After your mother?

45:25.492 --> 45:27.963
What? No, no. That's not...

45:30.541 --> 45:33.463
My, um...
My daughter was killed.

45:33.867 --> 45:37.264
Oh. I'm...

45:37.326 --> 45:39.897
I'm so, so sorry.

45:40.747 --> 45:43.629
Oh, would you like to
come in with me?

45:43.715 --> 45:45.640
Or we could even
just have a coffee.

45:45.686 --> 45:48.389
Uh, I'm sorry.
Really, I, um...

45:48.475 --> 45:50.988
I can't...
I really did forget something.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.448
My son died.

45:54.234 --> 45:55.701
Oh.

45:58.301 --> 45:59.836
I'm so sorry.

46:00.408 --> 46:02.110
How old was yours?

46:05.728 --> 46:06.862
Thirteen.

46:07.350 --> 46:10.227
God. That's awful.

46:11.976 --> 46:17.562
My son and my grandson
drowned four months ago.

46:18.005 --> 46:19.700
The little one was seven.

46:20.072 --> 46:21.488
Oh, my God!

46:22.281 --> 46:25.444
I've been coming here
for a couple of months now.

46:26.468 --> 46:28.088
And it has helped.

46:28.308 --> 46:30.812
It doesn't
make it easier obviously,

46:30.864 --> 46:35.307
but sometimes
it makes it less lonely.

46:37.212 --> 46:38.798
Okay.

46:38.888 --> 46:41.624
And now I'm about to
embarrass myself but, uh,

46:43.495 --> 46:47.933
if you need someone
to talk to...

46:48.587 --> 46:50.291
'Cause we all do.

46:56.434 --> 46:58.036
If you need it.

47:00.570 --> 47:03.361
Okay.

47:03.541 --> 47:05.759
Thank you. Really.

47:08.458 --> 47:09.540
Okay.

47:14.305 --> 47:15.518
Bye-bye.

47:28.447 --> 47:29.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:31.389 --> 47:33.845
- I'm going to bed.
- Where were you?

47:33.917 --> 47:37.756
At the movies.
Gonna go to bed.

47:37.804 --> 47:39.941
Okay. I'll come up with you.

47:40.556 --> 47:41.670
Okay.

48:01.914 --> 48:04.063
I'll be right back.

48:05.152 --> 48:07.598
No you won't.
You're taking the blanket.

48:08.437 --> 48:09.905
I can't sleep.

48:12.302 --> 48:13.871
It's freezing out there.

48:14.921 --> 48:16.401
Well, the heater's up there.

48:17.927 --> 48:19.061
Okay.

48:20.870 --> 48:22.070
Is that okay?

48:24.170 --> 48:26.141
If it gets too cold,
come back in.

48:31.084 --> 48:32.659
I just need to sleep.

50:02.244 --> 50:03.245
Shit.

51:07.132 --> 51:09.169
Oh, Annie. You came.

51:09.171 --> 51:10.584
It's a little earlier
than we said.

51:10.586 --> 51:12.945
Ah, you're perfect.
Come in. Come in.

51:20.227 --> 51:22.656
Uh, your welcome mat.

51:23.063 --> 51:25.353
Ah! It's kind of cute, huh?

51:25.355 --> 51:28.132
Yeah. My mother used to
embroider ones just like that.

51:28.134 --> 51:30.468
Did she really?
Isn't that funny?

51:31.382 --> 51:33.417
Please come in. Sit.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.536
First there's the...

51:37.646 --> 51:39.605
The smell of something wrong.

51:41.503 --> 51:45.568
And then the body.

51:46.628 --> 51:52.469
Covered in black blood,
like tar.

51:58.053 --> 52:01.573
And her head wasn't there
so I couldn't see her face.

52:01.614 --> 52:04.085
But they were gone.

52:05.373 --> 52:09.238
And her hands,
and her little finger nails.

52:44.877 --> 52:47.180
How is your relationship
with your son?

52:48.545 --> 52:50.603
- Peter?
- Hmm.

52:51.787 --> 52:53.898
Oh, God. Um...

52:56.834 --> 52:58.804
Okay, I sleepwalk.

53:01.288 --> 53:04.052
I mean, I haven't done it
in years, but, um...

53:04.767 --> 53:07.800
A couple years ago,
I woke up

53:08.331 --> 53:11.380
and I was standing
next to Peter in Charlie's bed

53:11.382 --> 53:14.527
when they shared a room.

53:16.753 --> 53:17.965
And they were

53:19.899 --> 53:22.869
completely covered
in paint thinner.

53:24.346 --> 53:25.949
And so was I.

53:26.857 --> 53:28.393
From head to toe.

53:31.837 --> 53:34.515
And I was standing there
with a box of matches

53:34.577 --> 53:36.298
and an empty can
of paint thinner.

53:38.835 --> 53:40.564
And I woke myself up
striking the match,

53:40.605 --> 53:43.798
which also woke Peter up,
and he started to scream.

53:45.603 --> 53:47.540
And I immediately put
the match out.

53:47.611 --> 53:49.708
Like, immediately.

53:49.784 --> 53:52.263
I mean, I was just
as shocked as he was.

53:53.555 --> 53:56.431
And it was impossible
to convince them

53:56.433 --> 53:58.555
that it was just sleepwalking,

53:58.674 --> 54:02.547
which of course it was, but...

54:03.263 --> 54:05.300
The timing was awful.

54:05.370 --> 54:08.179
Peter and I had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase,

54:08.181 --> 54:11.251
just forever arguing
about nothing, such...

54:13.847 --> 54:15.349
Frivolous stuff.

54:18.671 --> 54:20.927
And Peter always held it
against me.

54:21.732 --> 54:23.307
And there was nothing
I can say

54:23.369 --> 54:25.405
and nothing I can do

54:25.686 --> 54:28.894
because it happened.

54:32.147 --> 54:33.948
While I was asleep.

54:38.195 --> 54:40.399
Hey! That was quick.

54:41.078 --> 54:42.845
Did you bike all the way here?

54:42.939 --> 54:45.206
Um, no. Actually my friend
drove me home.

54:45.292 --> 54:48.405
Oh, uh, by the way,
Peter, have you, um...

54:48.479 --> 54:51.515
Have you signed up for that,
uh, SAT prep course?

54:51.580 --> 54:52.408
I'll do it tomorrow.

54:52.410 --> 54:53.947
Yeah, you know what,
you gotta do that

54:53.949 --> 54:55.483
because it's coming up.

55:31.677 --> 55:33.447
Jesus Christ, Annie.

55:34.899 --> 55:37.424
You're not planning on letting
him see that, are you?

55:37.494 --> 55:39.111
- Who?
- Peter.

55:39.181 --> 55:40.999
How do you think he's gonna
feel when he sees that?

55:41.001 --> 55:42.626
What? It's not about him.

55:42.628 --> 55:43.743
Oh, no?

55:43.745 --> 55:46.143
No. It's a neutral view
of the accident.

55:55.913 --> 55:57.740
Are you, uh, are you
coming down to dinner?

55:57.796 --> 55:58.402
I'm making dinner.

55:58.404 --> 56:00.739
No, I made the dinner.
I came to get you.

56:00.873 --> 56:03.533
Come, stay, whatever you want.
I don't really give a shit.

56:50.843 --> 56:52.439
This is really good, Dad.

56:53.783 --> 56:54.852
Thanks, buddy.

57:14.235 --> 57:15.754
You okay, Mom?

57:19.508 --> 57:20.510
What?

57:22.740 --> 57:24.710
Is there something
on your mind?

57:27.152 --> 57:28.954
Is there something
on your mind?

57:31.704 --> 57:36.386
It just seems like there might
be something you wanna say.

57:36.388 --> 57:37.803
- Peter...
- Like what?

57:37.842 --> 57:40.015
I mean, why would I wanna
say something

57:40.067 --> 57:41.954
so I can watch you
sneer at me.

57:43.301 --> 57:45.211
Sneer at you?
I don't ever sneer at you.

57:45.290 --> 57:46.364
Oh, sweetie.
You don't have to.

57:46.388 --> 57:47.814
You get your point across.

57:48.016 --> 57:49.901
Okay, so fine. Then say
what you wanna say then.

57:49.965 --> 57:50.646
Peter.

57:50.728 --> 57:55.149
I don't wanna say anything.
I've tried saying things.

57:55.188 --> 57:56.633
Okay, so try again.
Release yourself.

57:56.657 --> 57:58.207
Oh, release you, you mean.

57:58.254 --> 58:00.330
Yeah, fine. Release me.
Just say it.

58:00.362 --> 58:01.713
Just fucking say it!

58:01.762 --> 58:04.183
Don't you swear at me,
you little shit!

58:04.238 --> 58:06.137
Don't you ever
raise your voice at me!

58:06.193 --> 58:08.021
I am your mother!

58:08.083 --> 58:09.522
Do you understand?

58:09.524 --> 58:13.568
All I do is worry and slave
and defend you.

58:13.570 --> 58:17.333
And all I get back is that
fucking face on your face.

58:17.403 --> 58:20.651
So full of disdain
and resentment

58:20.698 --> 58:22.573
and always so annoyed.

58:22.630 --> 58:24.691
Well, now your sister is dead.

58:25.199 --> 58:28.518
And I know you miss her,
and I know it was an accident

58:28.572 --> 58:29.882
and I know you're in pain.

58:29.918 --> 58:31.958
And I wish I could take that
away for you.

58:32.021 --> 58:34.715
I wish I could shield you
from the knowledge

58:34.717 --> 58:38.772
that you did what you did,
but your sister is dead!

58:39.452 --> 58:41.254
She's gone forever!

58:42.889 --> 58:45.035
And what a waste.

58:45.097 --> 58:47.746
If it could have maybe brought
us together or something.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.787
If you could have just said,
"I'm sorry",

58:49.834 --> 58:51.897
or faced up to what happened.

58:51.959 --> 58:54.462
Maybe then we could do
something with this.

58:54.532 --> 58:57.198
But you can't take
responsibility for anything!

58:57.279 --> 59:00.040
So now I can't accept...

59:00.141 --> 59:04.251
And I can't forgive because...

59:06.796 --> 59:10.054
Because nobody admits
anything they've done!

59:41.720 --> 59:43.121
What about you, Mom?

59:48.860 --> 59:50.727
She didn't wanna go
to the party.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.556
So why was she there?

59:56.088 --> 59:58.490
All right.
We're stopping this right now.

01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:01.406
That's it.

01:00:03.568 --> 01:00:06.790
I said stop right now.

01:00:06.858 --> 01:00:08.093
Fine!

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:16.713
Fine.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.614
Joan?

01:01:32.598 --> 01:01:35.162
Oh! Annie!

01:01:35.164 --> 01:01:38.328
- Hey.
- Oh!

01:01:38.703 --> 01:01:40.560
- Annie!
- Hi!

01:01:41.879 --> 01:01:43.657
Oh, my!

01:01:43.892 --> 01:01:45.384
How are you?

01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:47.585
- Oh, Annie! I'm...
- Are you okay?

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:53.620
I'm... I am, yes.
I'm really good.

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:57.731
- I'm really, really...
- Okay.

01:01:58.599 --> 01:02:02.254
Something's...
Something happened, Annie,

01:02:02.324 --> 01:02:07.118
and I feel completely
turned around.

01:02:07.207 --> 01:02:09.480
What happened?

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:11.401
I don't even know
if I should say.

01:02:11.403 --> 01:02:12.645
What do you mean?

01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:14.383
You're gonna think I am crazy!

01:02:14.385 --> 01:02:15.452
No, not at all.

01:02:15.516 --> 01:02:17.801
Oh. Okay.

01:02:18.763 --> 01:02:20.000
All right, come on.

01:02:22.396 --> 01:02:26.908
I met a spiritual medium.

01:02:28.302 --> 01:02:31.350
They were performing
an open séance.

01:02:31.352 --> 01:02:33.112
I know, I know
what you're thinking,

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:34.880
but they asked me to attend.

01:02:34.944 --> 01:02:37.710
They were bringing skeptics
in and scientists.

01:02:37.749 --> 01:02:40.392
So I went, fully skeptical.

01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:44.887
And what I experienced there,
Annie, was truly...

01:02:45.086 --> 01:02:45.831
Open séance...

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:51.801
They brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century.

01:02:51.872 --> 01:02:55.668
And no, no, not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way, no.

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:56.873
And the man sitting
next to me

01:02:56.875 --> 01:03:00.202
was a completely
cynical neurologist

01:03:00.204 --> 01:03:04.547
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it.

01:03:04.602 --> 01:03:07.740
No, I... I... I know
what you're thinking. I do.

01:03:07.794 --> 01:03:11.485
But I... I approached
the medium afterwards

01:03:11.556 --> 01:03:14.303
and I asked her about my son
and my grandson

01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:17.367
and she came to my apartment
and she...

01:03:22.908 --> 01:03:25.056
She ended up performing...

01:03:26.031 --> 01:03:30.394
Well... She conjured
my grandson.

01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:34.242
No, no, no, I know, I know
what that smile is. I know.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.715
Annie, Annie...
I wouldn't believe it either,

01:03:36.717 --> 01:03:38.329
I didn't believe it,

01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:42.251
but I heard his voice.

01:03:42.974 --> 01:03:45.769
I felt his presence
in the room.

01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:48.230
Annie, this is real.

01:03:49.968 --> 01:03:51.743
What are you doing right now?

01:03:52.157 --> 01:03:53.808
I'm just here shopping.

01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:55.218
Do you wanna come over?

01:03:55.421 --> 01:03:58.737
Oh, Annie. Please, Annie.
I really think you should.

01:03:58.812 --> 01:04:01.750
It would be everything
if you came.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:16.011
Nice mood setter.

01:04:25.873 --> 01:04:27.273
Okay.

01:04:29.012 --> 01:04:31.323
I'm going to put my hand
on the glass,

01:04:32.658 --> 01:04:34.801
but I'm not going to
add pressure.

01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:37.281
You do the same.

01:04:46.063 --> 01:04:47.563
All right.

01:04:52.817 --> 01:04:54.213
Louis...

01:04:56.703 --> 01:04:59.741
Louis, are you here?
It's Grandma.

01:05:10.513 --> 01:05:14.656
Louis, if you are here
with us,

01:05:15.855 --> 01:05:19.325
please just try
and slide the glass.

01:05:23.743 --> 01:05:27.617
Louis, if you're here...

01:05:30.546 --> 01:05:31.847
Hi, Louis!

01:05:31.905 --> 01:05:35.412
- Hi, Louis!
- How did you do that?

01:05:36.328 --> 01:05:40.722
Louis, I'm going to ask you
some questions. Okay, sweetie?

01:05:41.144 --> 01:05:45.475
If the answer is yes,
slide the glass to the right.

01:05:45.867 --> 01:05:47.467
If it's no,

01:05:47.609 --> 01:05:50.760
slide it the other way,
to the left.

01:05:50.892 --> 01:05:52.567
Do you understand?

01:05:55.912 --> 01:05:59.185
Louis, are you okay?

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:03.734
Are you in pain?

01:06:04.988 --> 01:06:08.232
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:08.586 --> 01:06:10.466
It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:10.529 --> 01:06:13.633
Louis, I brought your chalkboard.

01:06:13.925 --> 01:06:16.627
Remember your chalkboard?

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.569
Can you write something?

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:52.112
Oh, Louis!
I love you, sweetheart!

01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:54.562
I'm sorry. Could we stop?

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:56.008
What?

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.161
I'm sorry. Please...

01:06:58.263 --> 01:07:00.694
Louis, we're going to stop
for a second,

01:07:00.756 --> 01:07:02.624
but I'll be right back.

01:07:06.409 --> 01:07:07.135
Are you all right?

01:07:07.137 --> 01:07:08.631
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I really...

01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:10.204
I understand, I understand.

01:07:10.206 --> 01:07:12.234
That's exactly how I reacted
the first time.

01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:13.732
I have to go. Okay.
I'm... I'm sorry. Thank you.

01:07:13.734 --> 01:07:16.504
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
- Thank you. Yeah.

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.850
I know. I know, honey.

01:07:26.927 --> 01:07:28.901
If you want to try this
on your own...

01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:31.528
- God...
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:31.577 --> 01:07:33.663
First light the candle,

01:07:33.734 --> 01:07:36.491
then choose an item that
belonged to your daughter.

01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:39.350
That will be your link.
Mine was the chalkboard.

01:07:39.405 --> 01:07:40.772
That's my link.

01:07:40.955 --> 01:07:43.024
It's all right. It's all right.

01:07:43.144 --> 01:07:45.792
It's okay. There you go.

01:07:45.794 --> 01:07:47.330
Then when you're ready,

01:07:47.687 --> 01:07:49.658
read this out loud,

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.591
every syllable, very carefully.

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:55.220
Sorry, why? What is it?

01:07:55.267 --> 01:07:56.747
I don't know
what language it is.

01:07:56.749 --> 01:07:58.937
The medium
had me read it first.

01:07:59.011 --> 01:08:00.979
It's to make things start.

01:08:01.067 --> 01:08:03.582
But remember,
your whole family...

01:08:03.607 --> 01:08:06.319
Every member needs to be
in the house.

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:09.144
Your son, everyone.
Very important.

01:08:09.146 --> 01:08:10.869
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.425
Deep breath.

01:08:13.459 --> 01:08:15.214
You didn't kill her, Annie.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:21.710
What?

01:08:22.334 --> 01:08:24.270
She isn't gone.

01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:13.174
Mom?
What are you doing?

01:11:18.267 --> 01:11:19.784
What's going on?

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.607
You're sleepwalking.

01:11:29.406 --> 01:11:33.243
I'm sorry. Is Charlie here?

01:11:35.978 --> 01:11:37.975
Why are you scared of me?

01:11:42.042 --> 01:11:43.166
What?

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:49.071
I never wanted
to be your mother.

01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:55.041
Why?

01:11:55.622 --> 01:11:57.291
I was scared.

01:11:59.201 --> 01:12:02.370
I didn't feel like a mother.

01:12:03.145 --> 01:12:04.861
But she pressured me.

01:12:05.724 --> 01:12:07.111
Then why did you have me?

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.034
It wasn't my fault.
I tried to stop it.

01:12:12.152 --> 01:12:13.386
How?

01:12:15.902 --> 01:12:17.927
I tried to have a miscarriage.

01:12:20.863 --> 01:12:22.049
How?

01:12:23.217 --> 01:12:24.272
However I could.

01:12:24.274 --> 01:12:27.382
I did everything they told me
not to do but it didn't work.

01:12:27.902 --> 01:12:29.819
I'm happy it didn't work.

01:12:30.226 --> 01:12:32.073
You tried to kill me.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:33.927
No, I did not. I love you!

01:12:33.929 --> 01:12:35.162
You tried to kill me!

01:12:35.186 --> 01:12:37.036
- I love you!
- Why did you try to kill me?

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.562
I didn't!
I was trying to save you!

01:12:38.618 --> 01:12:40.664
Why did you try to kill me?

01:13:07.445 --> 01:13:08.623
Peter?

01:13:10.701 --> 01:13:12.265
Peter, sweetheart? Wake up.

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:14.493
- What?
- It's okay. It's me.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.987
I am so, so sorry
for everything.

01:13:17.043 --> 01:13:18.451
- Please, please forgive me.
- It's okay.

01:13:18.475 --> 01:13:19.669
I can't stand
the things I said.

01:13:19.671 --> 01:13:21.140
It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:22.748 --> 01:13:25.100
Can you get up, sweetheart?
We're gonna try something.

01:13:25.124 --> 01:13:26.614
I was having a nightmare.

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:28.115
Oh, it's okay.
We can do something.

01:13:28.162 --> 01:13:28.980
Do what?

01:13:28.982 --> 01:13:31.019
I figured it out.
Come on, come on.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.492
Steven. Baby. Steve, wake up.

01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:39.001
- What?
- Come downstairs.

01:13:39.065 --> 01:13:40.301
We're gonna try
something together.

01:13:40.325 --> 01:13:42.475
Come on, come on.

01:13:44.942 --> 01:13:46.429
Steve, come on. Let's go.

01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:02.810
- Dad?
- It's okay.

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:12.221
Come on, come on!

01:14:18.699 --> 01:14:21.366
Okay. So...

01:14:21.489 --> 01:14:23.486
It's freezing in here.

01:14:23.515 --> 01:14:25.216
Wait! No, no, no.
What are you doing? Wait!

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.217
I'm gonna close the window.

01:14:26.219 --> 01:14:27.665
No, no.
We can't change anything.

01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:29.167
I don't wanna mess it up.

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:31.580
Everyone needs to sit.
Come sit.

01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:33.966
My friend Joan taught me
how to do this.

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:36.626
What friend Joan?

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:38.192
We need our palms on the table

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:39.881
and our fingers to touch.
Please.

01:14:39.883 --> 01:14:41.323
What are we doing here, Annie?

01:14:41.368 --> 01:14:42.803
Please. You'll see.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.942
Please. Trust me.

01:14:51.369 --> 01:14:52.794
All right, fine.

01:14:56.564 --> 01:14:58.633
We can do it over here then.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.564
Peter. Okay.

01:15:02.774 --> 01:15:05.208
Okay, Steve. Come on.

01:15:06.137 --> 01:15:07.983
I need you both
to concentrate.

01:15:07.985 --> 01:15:08.876
On what?

01:15:08.878 --> 01:15:09.863
Think about Charlie,
if you can.

01:15:09.865 --> 01:15:12.298
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Sweetheart, please, please.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.369
I tried this 20 minutes ago

01:15:13.371 --> 01:15:14.772
- and it worked.
- What worked?

01:15:14.774 --> 01:15:15.750
I would not be bringing you
down here if it didn't.

01:15:15.752 --> 01:15:16.611
Well, I just need to show you.

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:20.296
- Show what?
- Fuck! I'm a...

01:15:20.727 --> 01:15:21.900
I'm a medium, okay?

01:15:21.902 --> 01:15:23.281
I was
seeing apparitions earlier

01:15:23.283 --> 01:15:25.521
and I just shook them off
and I shouldn't have.

01:15:25.809 --> 01:15:26.898
Please, I know how it sounds,

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:27.944
but there's no way
to talk about it.

01:15:27.968 --> 01:15:30.159
I just need to show you, okay?
Please, you'll see.

01:15:30.214 --> 01:15:32.070
- I'm completely lucid.
- Peter, go to bed.

01:15:32.124 --> 01:15:33.851
What! No, no, no!
Peter, please!

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:34.852
We need to do this
as a family.

01:15:34.854 --> 01:15:37.652
This needs all our energies,
okay? Together.

01:15:37.688 --> 01:15:40.126
All right, I'll stay.

01:15:40.364 --> 01:15:41.959
Steve. Steve, please.

01:15:41.961 --> 01:15:44.290
I really, really need you
to be open to this.

01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:47.357
Please, please.
I promise... Both of you.

01:15:47.425 --> 01:15:50.315
Please. I need you
to be open. Please.

01:15:50.526 --> 01:15:54.174
Come on, Steve.
Come on, come on. I promise.

01:15:54.176 --> 01:15:57.270
Okay.

01:15:57.822 --> 01:15:59.414
Okay, good.

01:15:59.749 --> 01:16:01.787
So, I read that earlier.

01:16:01.789 --> 01:16:03.624
I don't think
I need to read that again.

01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:06.293
What language is even that?

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:09.142
Try to concentrate.

01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:17.093
Charlie?

01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:20.238
Charlie, are you here?

01:16:28.354 --> 01:16:29.889
Charlie, it's Mommy.

01:16:30.944 --> 01:16:32.498
And Daddy and Peter.

01:16:39.722 --> 01:16:42.260
Charlie, if you're
in this room with us,

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.373
I'm gonna have us all
touch the glass.

01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:45.809
Don't add pressure.

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:48.493
Now if you're in here,
Charlie,

01:16:48.579 --> 01:16:50.869
I want you to move
the glass for us.

01:16:50.938 --> 01:16:52.122
Even if it's just a tiny bit.

01:16:52.124 --> 01:16:53.229
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie!
- Even if it's just the tiniest

01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:54.867
little movement.
Okay, Charlie?

01:16:57.173 --> 01:16:58.231
Okay.

01:16:59.311 --> 01:17:03.174
Shit. What the hell?

01:17:04.048 --> 01:17:06.017
- What?
- You don't feel that?

01:17:06.571 --> 01:17:07.511
What? Feel what?

01:17:07.513 --> 01:17:11.406
Like, you don't feel
the air flexing?

01:17:14.845 --> 01:17:16.912
Wow! Yes!

01:17:16.914 --> 01:17:19.284
Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!

01:17:19.548 --> 01:17:22.858
Okay. Now, Charlie,
what I'd like for you to do

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.825
is I'd like for you to show
them what you did earlier.

01:17:30.201 --> 01:17:31.722
Can you show them what
you just did for me before?

01:17:31.743 --> 01:17:33.846
- Mom.
- She's gonna do it.

01:17:38.563 --> 01:17:40.649
- That's enough!
- What! No, no, no!

01:17:40.651 --> 01:17:42.982
Listen,
when I did this earlier,

01:17:43.361 --> 01:17:46.070
this manifested on the page.
I saw it!

01:17:46.072 --> 01:17:47.520
- I saw it!
- What is it?

01:17:47.522 --> 01:17:48.974
- It's Charlie!
- Annie!

01:17:48.976 --> 01:17:50.135
Charlie, did you want to draw
some more?

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:52.205
- You can keep going.
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:17:52.236 --> 01:17:54.453
Okay, we need to keep
our fingers touching...

01:17:54.455 --> 01:17:56.176
You are scaring him!

01:17:56.178 --> 01:17:58.674
No, I am not!
Peter, Peter, listen...

01:17:58.676 --> 01:17:59.797
Stop it!

01:17:59.799 --> 01:18:02.287
Listen to me.
There is no need to be scared.

01:18:02.289 --> 01:18:03.460
This is your sister.

01:18:04.741 --> 01:18:05.741
Mom.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:11.335
Charlie, what's wrong?

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.660
Hello?

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:57.026
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?

01:18:57.028 --> 01:18:58.111
I don't like this.

01:18:58.113 --> 01:18:59.739
- Dad, I don't like this.
- What's happening?

01:18:59.741 --> 01:19:01.114
- Please stop.
- Annie, please, stop this.

01:19:01.116 --> 01:19:02.173
- What's going on?
- Please stop this.

01:19:02.175 --> 01:19:03.583
- Please.
- Mom!

01:19:03.585 --> 01:19:05.139
You're really freaking me out.
Please stop.

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:06.310
What's happening?
Why is everyone scared?

01:19:06.312 --> 01:19:07.553
Dad, make it stop.

01:19:08.108 --> 01:19:09.458
Why are you scaring me!

01:19:09.507 --> 01:19:11.712
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Make it fucking stop!

01:19:11.759 --> 01:19:13.800
- Make it stop!
- Where's Mom!

01:19:13.864 --> 01:19:16.845
Stop it!
Stop it now! Please stop!

01:19:16.889 --> 01:19:18.892
Mom? Peter?
Peter, I'm scared.

01:19:18.941 --> 01:19:20.904
Dad, make it stop!

01:19:20.992 --> 01:19:24.754
What the hell?
What are you doing?

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.089
What happened?

01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:21.928
Our country has had
many ups and downs

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:23.243
economically speaking.

01:20:23.245 --> 01:20:24.711
We've talked
about the struggles

01:20:24.749 --> 01:20:29.604
during the 1800s
compared to the fall of 1929,

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:32.464
in an era that
become known appropriately

01:20:32.519 --> 01:20:34.168
as the Great Depression.

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:38.225
For a decade we suffered
through many, many hardships.

01:20:38.273 --> 01:20:43.147
In 1929, Wall Street had been
going so well

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:47.172
that when it finally crashed
because of the Great Boom,

01:20:47.235 --> 01:20:51.805
it caused a huge decline
in the economy.

01:20:51.911 --> 01:20:55.542
So much so
that it caused food lines.

01:20:58.385 --> 01:21:01.694
This is where
the Federal Government has,

01:21:01.696 --> 01:21:03.094
or still has...

01:21:13.774 --> 01:21:16.018
Uh, uh. Yes, Peter?

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.552
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:21.202
Um, of course. Take the pass.

01:21:24.767 --> 01:21:26.091
As I was saying...

01:21:31.728 --> 01:21:32.728
Hello?

01:21:32.983 --> 01:21:34.699
<i>Can you guess
who just called me from school</i>

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.718
<i>in complete hysterics?</i>

01:21:37.685 --> 01:21:40.221
- Charlie?
- <i>What?</i>

01:21:41.632 --> 01:21:43.887
Uh, nothing. What happened?

01:21:43.889 --> 01:21:45.385
<i>Peter just called me, Annie,</i>

01:21:45.387 --> 01:21:47.496
<i>terrified,
crying in the halls,</i>

01:21:47.498 --> 01:21:48.602
<i>convinced
he's being threatened</i>

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:51.067
<i>by some vengeful spirit.</i>

01:21:51.122 --> 01:21:53.145
Why does he think
he's being threatened?

01:21:53.183 --> 01:21:56.190
<i>Listen to me, Annie.
I have a son to protect.</i>

01:21:56.667 --> 01:21:57.369
What does that mean?

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:59.674
<i>It means that that's what
I'm worried about right now</i>

01:21:59.712 --> 01:22:00.591
<i>and that's how...</i>

01:22:00.593 --> 01:22:02.027
Hey, don't talk to me
like this.

01:22:02.062 --> 01:22:03.662
He's my son too...

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:04.919
Oh!

01:22:15.575 --> 01:22:18.138
Do not hang up on me again.

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:21.472
I am not sleepwalking anymore.
Do you understand?

01:22:46.635 --> 01:22:47.656
<i>At the tone,</i>

01:22:47.658 --> 01:22:49.791
<i>please record
your voice message.</i>

01:22:49.793 --> 01:22:51.264
<i>When you are
finished recording,</i>

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:54.316
<i>you may hang up or press pound
for more options.</i>

01:22:54.318 --> 01:22:56.169
<i>Annie, hi!</i>

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.420
<i>This is Patrick
at the Archer Gallery.</i>

01:22:58.422 --> 01:23:01.875
<i>Um, I was just calling
first to see how you're doing,</i>

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:03.556
<i>how your family's doing.</i>

01:23:03.558 --> 01:23:04.850
<i>We've all been thinking
about you</i>

01:23:04.852 --> 01:23:07.109
<i>and just worrying about you</i>

01:23:07.111 --> 01:23:09.206
<i>and hoping you're okay.</i>

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:11.772
<i>You guys have been in our
constant thoughts and prayers.</i>

01:23:11.774 --> 01:23:17.066
<i>And then also, uh, we just
wanted to, well, to say first,</i>

01:23:17.068 --> 01:23:19.820
<i>if you need us to postpone
the show or push the date,</i>

01:23:19.852 --> 01:23:21.708
<i>it's obviously more than okay.</i>

01:23:21.943 --> 01:23:25.874
<i>And if not, uh,
we just wanna call and see</i>

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:29.182
<i>if we could help
in any way or offer...</i>

01:23:41.241 --> 01:23:43.855
Oh, jeez. That smell.

01:23:53.348 --> 01:23:55.476
Annie?
What's that smell?

01:24:20.949 --> 01:24:22.491
What the fuck happened here?

01:24:23.522 --> 01:24:25.812
I didn't feel like
looking at it anymore.

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:15.663
Charlie?

01:27:55.792 --> 01:27:58.347
Peter?
Oh my God, Peter!

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.862
What's wrong, baby?
What's happening?

01:28:00.864 --> 01:28:01.909
What are you doing?

01:28:01.911 --> 01:28:02.925
What do you mean?

01:28:02.927 --> 01:28:04.593
You were pulling on my head!

01:28:04.595 --> 01:28:05.745
What? No I wasn't.
I just came in.

01:28:05.769 --> 01:28:08.044
You were screaming.
What happened?

01:28:08.114 --> 01:28:09.359
I saw Charlie in the corner

01:28:09.361 --> 01:28:11.337
and then you started
trying to pull my head off!

01:28:11.339 --> 01:28:13.301
Oh, Peter.
I would never do that to you.

01:28:13.303 --> 01:28:15.121
Are you crazy? Please, baby.

01:28:16.517 --> 01:28:18.086
What corner
did you see Charlie?

01:28:19.799 --> 01:28:21.154
Peter, listen to me.

01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:23.340
I don't know what's happening
or what you just saw,

01:28:23.403 --> 01:28:25.044
but I am stopping this.

01:28:25.106 --> 01:28:27.127
Do not tell Dad
what you just said to me.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.245
Do not, okay?
Because it is not true.

01:28:29.247 --> 01:28:30.133
Something is happening

01:28:30.135 --> 01:28:31.203
and I'm the only one
who could stop it.

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:33.191
Do you understand?
I'm the only one

01:28:33.193 --> 01:28:34.515
who can fix this.

01:31:16.368 --> 01:31:17.479
Joan?

01:31:22.042 --> 01:31:24.352
Joan, please.
I need to talk to you.

01:31:27.953 --> 01:31:30.775
Joan, I really need
to ask you a question.

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:39.372
Joan!

01:32:02.111 --> 01:32:03.629
Peter!

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:10.393
Peter!

01:32:12.922 --> 01:32:14.877
Peter!

01:32:18.693 --> 01:32:20.981
I expel you!

01:32:24.782 --> 01:32:26.617
Zantany!

01:32:31.387 --> 01:32:32.820
Dagdany!

01:32:35.268 --> 01:32:37.077
Aparagon!

01:32:39.546 --> 01:32:41.322
Peter!

01:32:41.613 --> 01:32:44.747
Get out!

01:32:49.045 --> 01:32:50.531
Peter!

01:33:20.632 --> 01:33:21.838
Oh, God.

01:36:50.888 --> 01:36:53.858
...so everyone
feels justified.

01:36:55.501 --> 01:36:59.143
Iphigenia's murder
was commanded by the gods.

01:37:29.866 --> 01:37:32.438
So, really,
Agamemnon had no choice...

01:38:01.159 --> 01:38:02.493
Peter.

01:38:04.452 --> 01:38:06.220
Peter, what's wrong?

01:38:08.706 --> 01:38:10.807
Peter, are you all right?

01:38:16.316 --> 01:38:18.792
Can he breathe?

01:38:18.916 --> 01:38:20.368
Peter,
what are you doing, man?

01:39:02.073 --> 01:39:04.639
<i>Call from West High School.</i>

01:39:24.845 --> 01:39:26.080
Hello.

01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.374
Yes, it is.

01:40:06.657 --> 01:40:08.375
Oh, thank God.

01:40:10.573 --> 01:40:13.081
Wait, what? Oh my God!

01:40:13.136 --> 01:40:15.804
What happened?
What happened to him?

01:40:15.867 --> 01:40:17.937
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:21.665
Oh my God. Oh, no.
Oh, who did that?

01:40:21.731 --> 01:40:24.146
He did it, apparently,
to himself.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:27.372
Smashed his face
into his own desk.

01:40:27.374 --> 01:40:30.032
Okay, Steve. Wait, wait.
Wait, Steve. Listen.

01:40:30.034 --> 01:40:32.612
Take his feet.
Please, take his feet.

01:40:38.164 --> 01:40:41.325
Steve, uh, upstairs...

01:40:41.387 --> 01:40:45.502
In the attic when you were
gone, I went up there and I...

01:40:45.549 --> 01:40:46.506
I just... I really need you

01:40:46.508 --> 01:40:48.343
to go up there
and see what I saw.

01:40:49.431 --> 01:40:51.006
There's a body.

01:40:52.028 --> 01:40:53.317
Yeah. I mean,
I think it's my mother,

01:40:53.319 --> 01:40:55.156
I think, but I can't tell
because the skin's all black

01:40:55.158 --> 01:40:57.693
and she's all distended
but the head is gone.

01:40:59.122 --> 01:41:02.092
Will you, please? I just need
you to go and see upstairs.

01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:06.500
Please, Steve.

01:41:18.127 --> 01:41:19.562
And then there's more.

01:41:20.214 --> 01:41:22.977
You mean more than your
mother's headless body?

01:41:23.066 --> 01:41:24.501
Of course there is.

01:42:12.273 --> 01:42:14.502
- Jesus, fuck!
- Okay, there's more.

01:42:14.504 --> 01:42:16.244
What the fuck was that?

01:42:16.246 --> 01:42:17.589
Why didn't you
call the police?

01:42:17.591 --> 01:42:19.234
The police can't help us.

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:20.658
Who the fuck is that up there?

01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:22.894
Do you remember Joan,
my friend whose grandson died?

01:42:22.896 --> 01:42:25.407
- She took me to her apartment.
- It did look like your mother.

01:42:25.466 --> 01:42:27.102
Well, listen. She taught me
how to do the séance.

01:42:27.104 --> 01:42:29.595
I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back

01:42:29.597 --> 01:42:31.840
and I saw it and felt it just
like you did with Charlie.

01:42:31.842 --> 01:42:34.246
Now, look.
This is my mother's album.

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.909
Now look here. See this?

01:42:35.911 --> 01:42:38.429
See her?
That's her. That's Joan.

01:42:38.431 --> 01:42:39.784
She didn't even mention
knowing my mom

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.547
and I've never met her before,
but she approached me.

01:42:41.549 --> 01:42:42.836
She consoled me.

01:42:42.838 --> 01:42:45.045
She told me about this séance,
and she showed me how.

01:42:45.047 --> 01:42:46.190
Now look at this.
See this symbol?

01:42:46.214 --> 01:42:47.156
On the necklace
my mom gave me.

01:42:47.198 --> 01:42:49.037
It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,

01:42:49.039 --> 01:42:51.187
and they're wearing it
in every photo.

01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:53.284
And look at that pattern!
Did you see up there?

01:42:53.286 --> 01:42:55.845
This was painted
above the body, right?

01:42:55.847 --> 01:42:57.329
In blood!

01:42:58.449 --> 01:43:02.389
You dug up the grave.
It was you, wasn't it?

01:43:02.467 --> 01:43:03.145
What?

01:43:03.147 --> 01:43:04.046
All those nights you were

01:43:04.048 --> 01:43:05.347
pretending to go
to the movies.

01:43:05.349 --> 01:43:06.389
You're not even listening!

01:43:06.391 --> 01:43:08.134
And then the day
the cemetery called, I said,

01:43:08.136 --> 01:43:10.346
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."

01:43:10.348 --> 01:43:12.654
Oh, God damn it!
Listen to me, Steve!

01:43:12.656 --> 01:43:14.173
I know you don't trust me

01:43:14.175 --> 01:43:16.068
and there is nothing
I can do about that.

01:43:16.835 --> 01:43:19.340
But they put a curse on us
when we brought Charlie back.

01:43:19.342 --> 01:43:21.326
We made a pact with something.

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:22.244
Something that is
in this house.

01:43:22.275 --> 01:43:24.076
I don't know what it is
but it is after Peter.

01:43:24.078 --> 01:43:26.991
I watched these pages fill.

01:43:26.993 --> 01:43:29.551
All of them are Peter!

01:43:29.962 --> 01:43:31.978
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.

01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:35.025
I don't know what I did
but Peter is in danger...

01:43:35.489 --> 01:43:37.459
And I started it.

01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:40.099
Now if we destroy this book,

01:43:40.598 --> 01:43:42.412
it will take me too.

01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:44.942
I tried to burn it. I tried.

01:43:44.944 --> 01:43:46.810
But my arm caught on fire
on its own

01:43:46.812 --> 01:43:48.374
as if I was linked to it
because I am linked to it.

01:43:48.376 --> 01:43:50.946
I understand this now. Please!

01:43:51.426 --> 01:43:53.429
If we don't destroy
this book...

01:43:56.491 --> 01:43:58.195
Peter will...

01:43:59.648 --> 01:44:02.397
Oh, God. Do you understand?

01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:07.953
We have to do this. Please,
please, please, please.

01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:09.498
For Peter.

01:44:20.761 --> 01:44:22.830
I need you to trust me, Steve.

01:44:24.566 --> 01:44:27.510
It needs to be me.
It's my fault.

01:44:27.512 --> 01:44:31.131
It's my fault.
I know it's my fault. Please.

01:44:31.133 --> 01:44:34.237
Please, I need you
to throw it in the fire.

01:44:35.439 --> 01:44:36.778
Please, I just...
I can't do it.

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:39.241
I can't.
I'm just too fucking scared.

01:44:39.243 --> 01:44:41.118
But if we don't do it...

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.690
If we don't do it,
it's gonna be Peter,

01:44:43.746 --> 01:44:47.094
it's gonna be our son.
Okay, I know this. I know so.

01:44:47.096 --> 01:44:50.120
Just, please, please,
please, please, please...

01:44:55.125 --> 01:44:57.667
Steve, please.
Please understand, baby.

01:44:57.669 --> 01:45:02.219
Please, please.
Please throw it in the fire.

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:12.549
Sweetheart, please.

01:45:12.816 --> 01:45:15.153
Please take it, take it.
You gotta do it.

01:45:15.155 --> 01:45:16.262
You gotta do it.

01:45:16.561 --> 01:45:18.552
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

01:45:18.622 --> 01:45:22.717
Okay, here. Okay.

01:45:22.763 --> 01:45:24.699
Now listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:36.250
Oh! You are
the love of my life.

01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:44.961
I love you, Steve.
I love you so, so much.

01:45:45.819 --> 01:45:48.336
Oh, God, I love you so much.

01:45:48.463 --> 01:45:50.277
And I love Peter so much.

01:45:54.566 --> 01:45:56.020
Now please, just...

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.353
Please just throw it in.

01:46:17.414 --> 01:46:19.603
I'm not gonna do this
with you anymore.

01:46:20.359 --> 01:46:22.410
What? No, no, no!

01:46:22.466 --> 01:46:24.735
No, no,
it's not helpful for you.

01:46:25.449 --> 01:46:27.987
You are sick, Annie.

01:46:28.785 --> 01:46:30.507
I need to call the police.

01:46:31.519 --> 01:46:33.354
Oh, God!

01:47:40.508 --> 01:47:41.576
Mom?

01:47:45.375 --> 01:47:46.442
Dad?

01:49:23.541 --> 01:49:24.674
Mom?

01:49:25.824 --> 01:49:26.824
Dad?

01:49:52.975 --> 01:49:54.376
Hello?

01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:43.815
Mom?

01:53:23.102 --> 01:53:25.686
Stop! Mom, please stop!

01:53:25.688 --> 01:53:27.941
Mom, I'm sorry!
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:53:32.175 --> 01:53:35.482
Mommy. Mommy, please.
I'm begging you.

01:53:35.498 --> 01:53:37.199
I'm begging you to stop.

01:53:45.406 --> 01:53:46.546
Mommy?

01:55:03.539 --> 01:55:05.346
Just gotta wake up.

01:55:05.348 --> 01:55:07.671
You just gotta wake up.
Come on. You're okay.

01:55:07.673 --> 01:55:10.854
Just wake up. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

02:01:27.594 --> 02:01:31.913
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's all right.

02:01:32.454 --> 02:01:33.810
Charlie...

02:01:37.683 --> 02:01:39.219
You're all right now.

02:01:42.093 --> 02:01:46.109
You are Paimon,

02:01:47.154 --> 02:01:50.059
one of the eight kings
of Hell.

02:01:52.825 --> 02:01:55.663
We have looked
to the Northwest

02:01:55.665 --> 02:01:57.576
and called you in.

02:01:58.475 --> 02:02:01.536
We've corrected
your first female body

02:02:01.905 --> 02:02:06.442
and give you now
this healthy male host.

02:02:07.146 --> 02:02:12.749
We reject the Trinity and pray
devoutly to you, great Paimon.

02:02:13.171 --> 02:02:17.434
Give us your knowledge
of all secret things.

02:02:17.809 --> 02:02:22.463
Bring us honor, wealth,
and good familiars.

02:02:23.057 --> 02:02:26.045
Bind all men to our will,

02:02:26.131 --> 02:02:32.133
as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to yours.

02:02:39.289 --> 02:02:41.025
Hail, Paimon!

02:02:41.778 --> 02:02:44.241
Hail, Paimon!

02:02:45.335 --> 02:02:47.840
Hail, Paimon!

02:02:48.970 --> 02:02:51.171
Hail!
