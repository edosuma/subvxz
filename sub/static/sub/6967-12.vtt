00:25.172 --> 00:27.640
Woman: What's she doing
there by herself?

00:36.917 --> 00:38.009
Man:
Teena?

00:38.085 --> 00:39.347
Honey?

00:41.288 --> 00:42.277
You're freezing.

00:42.356 --> 00:43.482
Where's yourjacket?

00:43.557 --> 00:45.320
Where's your daddy?

00:45.392 --> 00:46.450
In theyard.

00:46.526 --> 00:49.427
He told me he needed
some time to himself.

00:49.496 --> 00:51.760
I'd say his time's up.

00:51.832 --> 00:52.958
Come on, honey.

00:53.066 --> 00:55.660
I'm sure he wouldn't
wantyou to catch cold.

00:57.070 --> 00:58.537
joel?

01:03.410 --> 01:04.741
Hey,Joel,

01:04.811 --> 01:08.645
the swing set's supposed to be
foryour daughter, not foryou.

01:08.715 --> 01:11.081
( screams )

01:11.151 --> 01:13.176
I'll call 91 1 .

01:21.261 --> 01:22.751
Daddy?

02:18.885 --> 02:20.580
Death by hypovolemia

02:20.687 --> 02:23.884
75% blood loss.

02:23.957 --> 02:26.050
That's over four liters
ofblood.

02:26.126 --> 02:29.994
You could say
the man was running on empty.

02:30.063 --> 02:32.827
The man's daughter,
eightyears old

02:32.899 --> 02:36.733
was away from his side
no more than ten minutes.

02:36.803 --> 02:38.464
She doesn't remember anything.

02:38.538 --> 02:40.165
No trace evidence
at the scene.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.767
Any evidence would have been
washed away byyesterday's rain.

02:43.844 --> 02:45.539
There were two small
puncture wounds

02:45.612 --> 02:47.079
in thejugular.

02:47.147 --> 02:48.580
Areyou at all familiar

02:48.648 --> 02:50.878
with the phenomenon
ofcattle mutilations?

02:50.984 --> 02:52.451
Hmm?

02:52.519 --> 02:54.316
Since 1 967, over 34 states

02:54.387 --> 02:58.084
have reported unsolved cases
ofcattle mutilations.

02:58.158 --> 03:00.388
( projectorhumming )

03:00.460 --> 03:02.928
The trace evidence
is remarkably similar.

03:02.996 --> 03:06.227
Incision marks
ofsurgical precision.

03:06.299 --> 03:10.030
The area around the mouth,
and, often, the sexual organs

03:10.103 --> 03:11.331
has been removed.

03:11.404 --> 03:13.338
There's a substantial degree
ofblood loss

03:13.406 --> 03:14.964
without a trace
ofblood.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.338
How can that be?

03:16.409 --> 03:17.535
Exsanguination.

03:17.611 --> 03:19.943
Ifyou stick a needle
in thejugular

03:20.013 --> 03:21.344
ofany living creature

03:21.414 --> 03:23.507
the heart itselfacts as a pump.

03:23.617 --> 03:25.881
These animals
had theirjugulars punctured

03:25.986 --> 03:29.922
the same as that man,
only this is the first time

03:30.023 --> 03:31.854
i've seen it on a human being.

03:31.925 --> 03:33.392
But there was no struggle.

03:33.493 --> 03:36.485
How can a manjust sit through
a bloodletting?

03:36.563 --> 03:38.724
The M.E. found
traces ofdigitalis--

03:38.798 --> 03:42.131
a South American plant that can
be used as a paralytic drug.

03:42.202 --> 03:44.727
These X Files indicate this
is a U.F.O.-related phenomena.

03:44.804 --> 03:46.237
Often, there are sightings

03:46.306 --> 03:49.207
in the sky near the incident,
surface burns...

03:49.276 --> 03:51.107
Witnesses often report
time loss.

03:51.177 --> 03:52.906
We've seen this
in abduction cases.

03:52.979 --> 03:55.777
That might explain why
she can't remember anything.

03:55.849 --> 03:59.285
Mulder, whywould alien beings
travel light-years to earth

03:59.386 --> 04:01.354
in order to play doctor
on cattle?

04:01.454 --> 04:06.084
For the same reason
we cut up frogs and monkeys.

04:06.159 --> 04:07.820
Besides...

04:07.894 --> 04:10.863
they seem to have stepped up
their interest.

04:26.646 --> 04:30.480
Her mother passed away from
ovarian cancer twoyears ago.

04:30.584 --> 04:32.814
There's no other family.

04:32.919 --> 04:36.855
We'll keep Teena here until we can
place herwith a foster family.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.320
Has she spoken about it?

04:40.393 --> 04:41.519
No, not a word.

04:41.595 --> 04:42.721
Any nightmares?

04:42.796 --> 04:46.027
No. At least,
not that I know of.

04:51.504 --> 04:53.472
Can we talk to her now?

04:53.540 --> 04:54.802
Yes.

04:55.775 --> 04:57.572
Teena?

04:59.079 --> 05:01.604
These are the people
we talked about.

05:01.681 --> 05:04.172
This is Miss Scully
and Mr. Mulder.

05:04.284 --> 05:07.151
Doyou think
you can talk to them?

05:07.220 --> 05:09.711
Okay.

05:12.859 --> 05:15.157
Hi.

05:16.162 --> 05:17.857
I knowyou must
be feeling

05:17.931 --> 05:19.296
very sad right now

05:19.366 --> 05:20.924
and scared

05:21.001 --> 05:24.767
but we want to find out
what happened

05:24.838 --> 05:26.772
so we can help stop

05:26.840 --> 05:29.775
whoever hurt
your daddy, okay?

05:29.843 --> 05:32.778
Did you ever see
any strangers

05:32.846 --> 05:35.974
with your daddy at home?

05:38.652 --> 05:41.712
Did you ever see anyone
yell atyour daddy

05:41.821 --> 05:43.584
oryour daddyyell at them?

05:43.657 --> 05:45.625
No.

05:45.692 --> 05:48.661
Can you think ofanyone
who might want

05:48.728 --> 05:49.854
to hurtyour daddy?

05:49.929 --> 05:51.328
No.

05:51.398 --> 05:53.332
That's a nice bunny, Teena.

05:55.535 --> 05:58.333
Can we talk about
what happened that day?

05:58.405 --> 06:02.273
About what happened
in the backyard?

06:02.342 --> 06:07.279
You remember any strange sounds
or lights

06:07.347 --> 06:09.042
or anything like that?

06:12.118 --> 06:14.951
There was red lightning.

06:15.021 --> 06:16.750
Can you
tell me more

06:16.823 --> 06:18.984
about the red lightning?

06:19.059 --> 06:21.550
I can't remember.

06:21.628 --> 06:24.188
It all went dark.

06:24.264 --> 06:28.257
Haveyou ever seen
anything like that before?

06:29.169 --> 06:30.659
You have?

06:30.737 --> 06:31.999
When?

06:32.072 --> 06:33.937
The men from the clouds.

06:34.007 --> 06:36.305
Theywere after my dad.

06:38.812 --> 06:40.677
( telephonerings )

06:42.382 --> 06:43.314
Scully.

06:43.383 --> 06:46.910
Whywere these men
afteryour dad?

06:47.020 --> 06:50.512
Theywanted to exsanguinate him.

06:50.623 --> 06:52.420
Mulder.

06:52.492 --> 06:54.084
What?

07:00.366 --> 07:02.357
There's been another one.

07:15.281 --> 07:18.148
It's like looking
at a mirror image.

07:19.619 --> 07:23.214
The victim, Reardon,
was married with one daughter.

07:23.323 --> 07:24.950
Cause ofdeath: hypovolemia.

07:25.024 --> 07:27.857
Mulder, this is uncanny.

07:27.927 --> 07:31.294
They also found traces
ofthe poison, digitalis.

07:31.364 --> 07:32.956
Puncture wound?

07:33.032 --> 07:35.296
Uh... yes.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.632
On thejugular.

07:37.704 --> 07:41.037
The time ofdeath was estimated
at 2:30 p.m.

07:41.107 --> 07:43.473
Same day,
only three hours earlier

07:43.543 --> 07:44.703
than the Simmons murder.

07:44.778 --> 07:46.268
That's Pacific Standard Time.

07:46.346 --> 07:49.406
That makes it
the exact same moment.

07:49.482 --> 07:52.747
It appears as ifwe
have two serial killers

07:52.852 --> 07:54.319
working in tandem.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.718
No, serial killers
rarelywork in pairs

07:56.790 --> 07:58.121
and when they do

07:58.191 --> 08:00.125
they kill together,
not separately.

08:00.193 --> 08:01.353
Mulder, nothing beyond

08:01.427 --> 08:03.861
your leading questions
to Teena Simmons

08:03.930 --> 08:06.023
substantiates
a U.F.O. mutilation theory.

08:06.099 --> 08:08.761
Was Reardon's daughter
here when he was murdered?

08:08.835 --> 08:11.269
Uh... yes.

08:11.337 --> 08:15.433
The police report states
that she remembers nothing.

08:15.508 --> 08:19.672
She's with her mother
and family in Sacramento.

08:19.746 --> 08:21.805
When will they be back?

08:21.881 --> 08:23.678
Tomorrow.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.514
Even money, she'll
remember red lightning.

09:44.864 --> 09:48.027
( footsteps approaching )

10:02.115 --> 10:04.481
( screaming )

10:08.688 --> 10:11.282
Teena?

10:11.357 --> 10:14.190
Teena?

10:16.629 --> 10:18.654
Teena?

10:21.401 --> 10:23.801
Teena!

10:35.448 --> 10:37.348
She was kidnapped from
the social services home

10:37.417 --> 10:39.612
around 1 1 :00 p.m.
Iast night.

10:39.686 --> 10:40.744
Looks like someone
was afraid

10:40.820 --> 10:42.651
she might remember too much.

10:42.722 --> 10:44.917
Someone
or something, Scully.

10:44.991 --> 10:46.458
Connecticut state troopers

10:46.526 --> 10:49.017
set up roadblocks
within a halfan hour.

10:49.128 --> 10:50.425
Nothing.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.363
Maybe theyweren't looking
in the right direction.

10:53.433 --> 10:56.527
I told them to contact us
in case they find her.

11:04.010 --> 11:05.443
Teena?

11:05.511 --> 11:07.706
No.

11:09.482 --> 11:10.676
What's your name?

11:10.750 --> 11:12.684
Cindy Reardon.

11:12.752 --> 11:15.277
Doyou live here, Cindy?

11:15.355 --> 11:17.550
Ever since I was born,
eightyears ago.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.998
Help!

11:27.066 --> 11:30.058
( whimpers )

11:30.169 --> 11:32.137
(yelling )

11:32.238 --> 11:35.435
Whew!

11:35.508 --> 11:39.000
This is the ceremonial signing
ofthe bill

11:39.078 --> 11:40.773
which is now known as...

11:40.847 --> 11:43.941
and forever forward
from this point on, known as...

11:44.017 --> 11:45.609
Cindy really is

11:45.685 --> 11:48.210
a beautiful little girl,
Mrs. Reardon.

11:48.287 --> 11:50.448
Doug and I wanted
to spoil her.

11:50.523 --> 11:52.252
We wanted to protect her

11:52.325 --> 11:54.953
from everything horrible
in the world.

11:59.532 --> 12:01.397
She was Daddy's
little girl.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.059
Is she an only child?

12:05.838 --> 12:08.807
May I ask... was Cindy adopted?

12:08.875 --> 12:10.604
No.

12:10.676 --> 12:13.543
I gave birth to her
at San Rafael General.

12:13.613 --> 12:15.171
So I assumeyou have

12:15.248 --> 12:17.739
all the proper
documentation--

12:17.784 --> 12:19.342
birth certificate...

12:19.419 --> 12:20.784
Ofcourse I do.

12:20.853 --> 12:24.118
Was she the only child
delivered at that birth?

12:24.190 --> 12:26.750
What the hell kind
ofquestion is that?

12:26.826 --> 12:28.987
Look, I have told the police

12:29.095 --> 12:30.494
everything I know.

12:30.596 --> 12:34.657
Mrs. Reardon, haveyou ever
seen this man before?

12:37.603 --> 12:39.195
Is this
your suspect?

12:39.272 --> 12:40.637
No.

12:40.706 --> 12:42.697
Did he do something
to Cindy?

12:42.775 --> 12:44.208
No, he...

12:44.277 --> 12:45.710
No, Mrs. Reardon.

12:45.778 --> 12:47.712
This is notyour daughter.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.476
That girl's name
is Teena Simmons.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.075
She lives in Greenwich,
Connecticut.

12:53.152 --> 12:54.915
That man-- her father--

12:54.987 --> 12:58.252
was killed in the same
manner as your husband.

12:58.324 --> 13:01.816
Cindy is my daughter.

13:01.894 --> 13:05.796
I can showyou videos
ofher birth.

13:05.865 --> 13:09.767
We tried for sixyears
to become pregnant.

13:09.836 --> 13:11.804
In vitro fertilization?

13:14.474 --> 13:15.805
At which clinic?

13:15.875 --> 13:20.039
The Luther Stapes Center
down in San Francisco.

13:20.113 --> 13:21.637
Mulder:
Thanks.

13:21.714 --> 13:24.615
Scully: Doyoustillbelieve
this is U.F. O.-related?

13:24.684 --> 13:27.244
Cindy Reardon didn't see
red lightning.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.982
The only thing similar
about these girls

13:30.056 --> 13:32.286
does seem to be
their appearance.

13:32.358 --> 13:34.724
There is
the random possibility

13:34.794 --> 13:37.888
that two people can have
an unrelated likeness.

13:37.997 --> 13:41.433
Who bothjust happen to see
their fathers exsanguinated.

13:41.501 --> 13:44.493
I'd like to get the odds on that
in Vegas.

13:53.079 --> 13:55.343
The girls are
the one and only link

13:55.414 --> 13:57.382
between identical murders.

13:57.450 --> 13:59.441
And one girl wasjust abducted.

13:59.519 --> 14:01.043
Kidnapped.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.054
* Po-ta-to, po-tah-to... *

14:03.122 --> 14:05.420
Where areyou going?

14:05.491 --> 14:08.551
Ifthe murders were committed
by the same person

14:08.628 --> 14:12.064
part ofthe pattern involves
kidnapping the daughter.

14:12.131 --> 14:14.224
You'd expect
the pattern to continue.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.028
I'm going to watch the girl.

14:16.102 --> 14:17.729
You check out the clinic.

14:17.803 --> 14:20.169
See ifthe Simmons
were enrolled.

14:20.239 --> 14:22.605
I'll call
the San Francisco bureau

14:22.675 --> 14:24.142
and get someone

14:24.210 --> 14:25.575
to relieveyou.

14:25.645 --> 14:26.805
Okay.

14:27.013 --> 14:29.379
Dr. Katz:
During vitro fertilization

14:29.448 --> 14:31.882
we canimplementfertilization
andimplantation

14:31.951 --> 14:33.885
ofthe embryo
in the uterus.

14:33.953 --> 14:37.684
Could a patient believe
she was receiving her own egg

14:37.757 --> 14:41.386
but actually receive another
without her knowledge?

14:41.460 --> 14:43.052
Not here.

14:43.162 --> 14:45.062
We have very strict
controls.

14:45.131 --> 14:47.361
Areyou aware ofever
having patients

14:47.466 --> 14:49.434
named Claudia
andJoel Simmons?

14:49.502 --> 14:51.163
That's confidential.
It's our policy.

14:51.237 --> 14:53.000
Both the Simmons are dead

14:53.072 --> 14:55.540
and their daughter
has been kidnapped.

14:55.608 --> 14:58.771
I'd say any information you have
that could help

14:58.844 --> 15:01.005
would overrideyour policy.

15:03.049 --> 15:05.313
You had copies
oftheir records transferred

15:05.384 --> 15:08.785
to Greenwich, Connecticut
in 1 991 .

15:13.893 --> 15:16.191
They came here nineyears ago

15:16.295 --> 15:19.662
under the supervision
ofa Dr. Sally Kendrick?

15:22.134 --> 15:24.068
Is there a problem?

15:26.339 --> 15:29.831
Dr. Kendrickwas nothing
but a problem.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.109
Hello, and welcome

15:32.178 --> 15:35.670
to the Luther Stapes Center
for reproductive medicine.

15:35.748 --> 15:37.340
I'm Dr. Sally Kendrick

15:37.416 --> 15:39.714
a specialist
in the exciting field

15:39.785 --> 15:41.844
ofin vitro fertilization...

15:41.921 --> 15:44.287
She was a resident here in 1 985.

15:44.357 --> 15:45.915
Brilliant.

15:45.992 --> 15:50.190
First in her class at Yale Med
where she got her M.D.

15:50.296 --> 15:53.629
after completing
her doctorate in biogenetics.

15:53.699 --> 15:56.031
Oh, we were thrilled to get her.

15:56.102 --> 15:58.434
And nowyou don't sound
so thrilled.

15:58.504 --> 16:01.996
We have reason to believe
that Dr. Kendrick

16:02.074 --> 16:04.941
was tampering
with genetic material

16:05.011 --> 16:08.606
offertilized ova in the lab
prior to implant--

16:08.681 --> 16:10.672
experimenting
with eugenics.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.980
Did you report this
to the A.M.A.?

16:13.052 --> 16:14.485
Ofcourse.

16:14.553 --> 16:16.077
I fired her

16:16.155 --> 16:19.556
and requested an investigation
from the health department.

16:19.625 --> 16:20.990
And what happened?

16:21.060 --> 16:24.052
The A.M.A. censured her.

16:24.163 --> 16:26.927
My request for
an investigation was denied.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.466
...atLutherStapes...

16:28.534 --> 16:32.493
Dr. Kendrick... disappeared.

16:32.605 --> 16:37.440
Weknowthepain ofinfertility,
andweare readytohelp.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.137
In the next halfhour

16:39.211 --> 16:42.009
I'll guideyou
through our l.V.F. program...

16:42.081 --> 16:44.549
Scully: Kendrick supervised
the Reardons'

16:44.617 --> 16:46.608
and Simmons' l.V.F. program.

16:46.686 --> 16:49.211
It seems she experimented
at the clinic.

16:49.288 --> 16:53.019
Mulder: And maybe now she's
trying to erase the results?

16:53.092 --> 16:56.220
I wish that we could guarantee
everyone success

16:56.329 --> 16:58.388
but with
our scientific advances

16:58.497 --> 17:00.658
a little luck,
and a lot ofhope

17:00.766 --> 17:02.324
miracles can happen.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.403
Well, she must have
had an accomplice

17:04.502 --> 17:06.936
in order to have done
both murders.

17:07.006 --> 17:10.999
Soyou think this is a vendetta
that she and a colleague have

17:11.077 --> 17:12.806
against
the Stapes Center?

17:12.877 --> 17:15.073
Haveyou abandoned
your U.F.O. connection?

17:15.146 --> 17:16.704
( phonerings )

17:16.781 --> 17:18.443
Hello?

17:18.517 --> 17:20.951
Hello?

17:22.188 --> 17:23.621
just a couple clicks.

17:23.689 --> 17:25.656
Must be
the wrong number.

17:25.724 --> 17:27.386
I'll tell you what...

17:27.460 --> 17:29.087
I'm going to sleep on it

17:29.161 --> 17:32.153
and we'll talk about it
in the morning.

17:32.231 --> 17:35.223
Mulder, you're rushing me
out ofthe room.

17:35.334 --> 17:36.801
No, I'm not.

17:36.869 --> 17:38.700
Doyou have a girl

17:38.771 --> 17:39.931
coming over?

17:40.005 --> 17:41.336
What's a girl?

17:41.407 --> 17:43.432
I got a movie
to watch on TV.

17:43.509 --> 17:44.908
Sleep tight.

17:44.977 --> 17:46.145
Seeyou in the morning.

17:58.958 --> 18:03.725
Areyou certain
she hasn't followed you?

18:03.796 --> 18:05.730
What areyou doing here?

18:05.798 --> 18:10.735
Well, I thought we might
take in a Warriors game.

18:10.803 --> 18:16.332
No. Actually, I was
just in the neighborhood

18:16.409 --> 18:18.104
and, uh...

18:19.779 --> 18:22.111
wondered if
I had ever told you

18:22.181 --> 18:25.480
about the Litchfield
experiments.

18:25.551 --> 18:28.850
Hmm... no, you haven't.

18:28.954 --> 18:32.390
Well, it was a most...

18:32.458 --> 18:35.325
interesting project.

18:35.394 --> 18:37.862
Highest level
ofclassification.

18:37.930 --> 18:40.899
All records have since
been destroyed.

18:40.966 --> 18:43.025
And those who knew ofit

18:43.102 --> 18:45.696
will deny knowledge
ofits existence.

18:45.771 --> 18:47.398
In the early '50s

18:47.473 --> 18:49.941
during the height
ofthe Cold War

18:50.009 --> 18:52.307
we got wind
that the Russians

18:52.378 --> 18:55.006
were fooling around
with eugenics--

18:55.080 --> 18:57.981
rather primitively,
I might add--

18:58.050 --> 18:59.847
trying to crossbreed

18:59.952 --> 19:02.546
their top scientists,
athletes--

19:02.655 --> 19:04.282
you name it--

19:04.390 --> 19:06.858
to come up with
the superior soldier.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.392
Naturally, wejumped

19:08.461 --> 19:10.725
on thebandwagon.

19:10.796 --> 19:13.321
Mulder:
the Litchfieldexperiment.

19:13.399 --> 19:17.460
Deep Throat: A group of
geneticallycontrolledchildren

19:17.536 --> 19:21.836
who were raisedandmonitored
ona compoundin Litchfield.

19:21.907 --> 19:24.273
Theboys were called 'Adam"

19:24.343 --> 19:26.903
andthegirls
were called "Eve. "

19:26.979 --> 19:28.913
There'sa woman

19:28.981 --> 19:30.471
youshouldsee

19:30.549 --> 19:31.777
andl'llmakesure

19:31.884 --> 19:35.251
thatyoucangetin.

19:35.321 --> 19:38.085
Agents Mulder and Scully here
to see Eve 6.

19:38.157 --> 19:40.523
Deposityour firearms.

19:40.593 --> 19:42.220
Sign for these.

19:42.294 --> 19:43.921
What are those?

19:43.996 --> 19:45.463
Panic buttons.

19:45.531 --> 19:48.295
Can't letyou inside
without one.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.903
Thankyou.

20:38.617 --> 20:39.777
Why the fashlight?

20:39.885 --> 20:42.979
She screams and screams
ifwe turn the overheads on.

20:43.088 --> 20:45.852
No one's ever got
a real good look at her.

20:49.929 --> 20:52.489
We'll be right outside.

21:01.273 --> 21:03.503
Mulder:
Hello?

21:14.019 --> 21:17.455
So I guess you found
whatyou're looking for.

21:25.264 --> 21:28.028
One ofus, at least.

21:30.869 --> 21:32.996
Sally Kendrick.

21:40.646 --> 21:43.308
Unlock the chains,
and then we'll talk.

21:43.382 --> 21:45.441
They're probably there
for a good reason.

21:45.517 --> 21:47.985
No. A bad reason.

21:48.053 --> 21:52.080
I paid too much attention
to a guard.

21:52.191 --> 21:54.159
I bit into his eyeball.

21:57.029 --> 21:59.964
I meant it
as a sign ofaffection.

22:00.032 --> 22:03.058
( laughs )

22:03.135 --> 22:07.435
Areyou here to give me
an l.Q test, by any chance?

22:07.506 --> 22:09.770
I think I can top 265.

22:09.842 --> 22:11.935
We're very bright,
we Eves.

22:12.011 --> 22:14.172
It runs
in the family.

22:14.246 --> 22:17.477
Where are the others,
the Adams and the Eves?

22:17.549 --> 22:20.575
We're prone to suicide.

22:20.686 --> 22:23.052
All that's left is me...

22:23.122 --> 22:24.680
and Eve 7.

22:24.790 --> 22:26.758
She escaped early on.

22:26.859 --> 22:28.622
And Eve 8.

22:28.694 --> 22:30.628
She escaped ten years later.

22:30.696 --> 22:33.688
Areyou Sally Kendrick?

22:33.766 --> 22:36.394
That's not my name, but...

22:36.468 --> 22:39.596
she is me, and I am her, and...

22:39.672 --> 22:41.697
we are all together.

22:41.774 --> 22:43.435
Scully:
Did you work

22:43.509 --> 22:47.001
for the Luther Stapes Center for
reproductive medicine in 1 985?

22:47.079 --> 22:51.175
In 1 985, I had been tied up
like this for twoyears

22:51.250 --> 22:52.945
and forwhat reason?

22:53.052 --> 22:54.986
No reason. I did nothing.

22:55.054 --> 22:56.521
I'm just me.

22:56.622 --> 22:58.954
They made me...

22:59.024 --> 23:02.050
but did they suffer?

23:02.161 --> 23:04.129
No. No, I suffer.

23:04.196 --> 23:05.891
I suffer!

23:05.964 --> 23:08.398
They keep me alive

23:08.467 --> 23:11.197
for the Litchfield project.

23:11.270 --> 23:13.670
They come in and they test me.

23:13.739 --> 23:16.867
They poke me
to see what went wrong.

23:16.942 --> 23:21.140
Sally knows what went wrong.

23:21.213 --> 23:26.173
You and you--

23:26.285 --> 23:28.276
you have 46 chromosomes.

23:28.387 --> 23:32.289
The Adams, me, the Eves--
we have 56.

23:32.357 --> 23:34.917
We have extra chromosomes.

23:34.993 --> 23:37.860
Number four, five,
1 2, 1 6, and 22.

23:37.930 --> 23:43.027
This replication ofchromosomes
also produces additional genes.

23:43.102 --> 23:46.799
Heightened strength,
heightened intelligence...

23:46.872 --> 23:49.033
Heightened psychosis.

23:49.108 --> 23:51.872
Saved the best for last.

23:55.114 --> 23:57.810
You don't believe me.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.977
I have proof.

24:00.085 --> 24:02.212
Look on mywall.

24:02.321 --> 24:05.085
My family album.

24:08.827 --> 24:12.024
Scully:
My God. It's the girls.

24:12.097 --> 24:13.928
Eve 6: We were close.

24:13.999 --> 24:17.765
We were very close.

24:17.836 --> 24:20.031
Sally Kendrick
was using the clinic

24:20.105 --> 24:22.596
to carry on
the Litchfield experiment.

24:22.674 --> 24:26.201
She was cloning herself.

24:29.448 --> 24:32.212
Cindy:
" Now I lay me down to sleep

24:32.284 --> 24:34.343
"I pray the Lord my soul to keep

24:34.453 --> 24:37.183
"ifl should die before I wake

24:37.289 --> 24:40.053
I pray the Lord
my soul to take."

24:40.125 --> 24:43.060
God bless
Grandma and Grampa Stenner

24:43.128 --> 24:44.925
Irma and lrmapop

24:44.997 --> 24:46.726
and God bless Mom

24:46.799 --> 24:49.700
and please take care of Daddy
up in heaven.

24:49.768 --> 24:53.568
You're such a special
little girl, Cindy.

25:08.754 --> 25:11.018
Good night, honey.

25:19.031 --> 25:20.692
If Eve 6 is right

25:20.766 --> 25:24.429
then there are
two other Eves out there.

25:24.503 --> 25:28.064
That could account for
the two identical murders

25:28.140 --> 25:30.802
occurring at exactly
the same time.

25:30.876 --> 25:33.674
Sally Kendrick does have
an accomplice. Herself.

25:33.745 --> 25:36.839
Until I heard that,
I suspected the girls.

25:36.915 --> 25:39.406
No, no. It seems
the two remaining Eves

25:39.518 --> 25:41.611
are doing awaywith the parents

25:41.720 --> 25:44.923
in order to keep Teena and Cindy
in the family.

26:17.956 --> 26:21.983
Scully: Doyou suppose the girls
have any idea ofwhat they are?

26:22.060 --> 26:25.655
I hope not.

26:33.672 --> 26:34.866
Mulder, let's go!

26:34.973 --> 26:37.669
I'll take the back.

26:39.645 --> 26:41.772
( knocking )

26:41.847 --> 26:43.439
There's someone upstairs.

26:43.515 --> 26:44.743
Wait outside.

27:11.109 --> 27:12.098
F.B.I.!

27:12.210 --> 27:15.236
I'm armed!

27:15.347 --> 27:16.609
Which one areyou?

27:16.682 --> 27:18.411
Eve 7 or Eve 8?

27:18.483 --> 27:20.747
Drop it.

27:20.819 --> 27:22.753
You know I'm capable.

27:24.690 --> 27:27.318
Slow. Very slow.

27:50.082 --> 27:52.710
The suspect's name
is Sally Kendrick

27:52.784 --> 27:55.048
early 40s, 5' 8",
1 35 pounds.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.350
Now, she may have
an accomplice

27:57.422 --> 27:58.946
similar in appearance.

27:59.024 --> 28:02.050
Kendrick is driving
a light blue '93 Corolla.

28:02.127 --> 28:04.857
She has exceptional strength
for her size.

28:04.930 --> 28:07.831
Soyou must consider her
armed and dangerous.

28:07.899 --> 28:11.494
Quite possibly she'll display
severe psychotic behavior.

28:11.570 --> 28:15.028
The Oakland bureau is here
to orchestrate the search

28:15.140 --> 28:16.539
across the bridge.

28:16.608 --> 28:17.768
What if..?

28:17.876 --> 28:19.810
What ifshe kills her?

28:19.878 --> 28:22.073
First Doug, now Cindy?

28:22.147 --> 28:24.741
The fact that Kendrick
and her accomplice

28:24.816 --> 28:27.512
murdered the fathers
and abducted the girls

28:27.586 --> 28:29.747
tells us that they
want them alive.

28:29.821 --> 28:32.949
I'm sure Cindy's alive
and we'll find her.

28:37.162 --> 28:39.653
And then what do we do?

29:11.496 --> 29:14.556
I'm sorryyou have
to meet this way

29:14.633 --> 29:18.034
but it's the best
for all concerned.

29:29.314 --> 29:33.842
Teena Simmons,
meet Cindy Reardon.

29:44.396 --> 29:47.797
Agent Scully? They found
the light blue Corolla

29:47.866 --> 29:49.390
in the parking lot

29:49.468 --> 29:51.868
ofSan Francisco
lnternational.

29:51.937 --> 29:54.633
Start a check
on every single passenger list

29:54.739 --> 29:57.071
for every fight
that left the terminal

29:57.175 --> 29:59.006
within the past 1 2 hours.

29:59.077 --> 30:01.102
Check every terminal
and make sure

30:01.213 --> 30:03.647
she's not hiding out
for a later fight.

30:03.715 --> 30:05.979
Remember, she may have
an accomplice.

30:06.051 --> 30:07.951
A motel manager in Pt. Reyes

30:08.019 --> 30:11.147
has a guest matching
Sally Kendrick's description.

30:11.223 --> 30:13.418
We found the car
at the airport.

30:13.492 --> 30:15.255
She might have ditched it.

30:15.327 --> 30:18.922
The manager said this woman
checked in with a little girl

30:18.997 --> 30:22.956
that she leaves in the afternoon
by herself, is gone all night

30:23.034 --> 30:24.831
and returns with the girl.

30:24.903 --> 30:26.302
The area is a place

30:26.371 --> 30:28.737
full ofvacationing
families with kids.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.740
This kid said to use chlorine

30:30.809 --> 30:34.245
to eradicate the dinofagellates
in the swimming pool.

30:34.346 --> 30:35.813
Sound like someoneyou know?

30:35.881 --> 30:38.247
That's it.

30:38.316 --> 30:41.376
I've always kept a close eye
on your behavior

30:41.453 --> 30:42.920
no matterwhere I was.

30:42.988 --> 30:44.250
The last fewyears

30:44.322 --> 30:47.189
I spent in search
ofthe remaining Eve.

30:47.259 --> 30:51.161
That, however, was cut short
byyour... activity.

30:51.229 --> 30:53.789
I'd hoped mywork
at the Stapes Center

30:53.865 --> 30:56.299
had corrected
the Litchfield faws.

30:56.368 --> 30:57.892
Psychotic behavior

30:57.969 --> 31:01.166
didn't develop
in the Adams and Eves

31:01.273 --> 31:04.731
until age 1 6,
homicidal behavior at 20.

31:04.843 --> 31:07.334
Imagine my... disappointment

31:07.445 --> 31:12.246
when I learned
ofyour accelerated development.

31:16.555 --> 31:19.786
How did you learn
ofeach other's existence?

31:19.858 --> 31:21.951
Wejust knew.

31:22.027 --> 31:25.360
Did you discuss
howyou would orchestrate

31:25.430 --> 31:27.523
your little... prank?

31:27.599 --> 31:29.590
Wejust knew.

31:29.668 --> 31:32.728
Why murderyour fathers?

31:37.442 --> 31:39.307
They weren't our fathers.

31:39.377 --> 31:41.106
We have no parents.

31:41.179 --> 31:42.908
We weren't born.

31:42.981 --> 31:45.074
We were created.

31:45.150 --> 31:49.177
You... You
cannot think that way.

31:49.254 --> 31:52.121
You're human beings...

31:52.190 --> 31:54.852
different, special...

31:54.926 --> 31:58.760
butyou cannot give in
to genetic destiny.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.957
That's why I've taken you.

32:01.032 --> 32:04.229
I was raised by a man
who knew what I was.

32:04.302 --> 32:08.170
He was a genetic engineer
on the project.

32:08.273 --> 32:10.434
With the proper environment

32:10.542 --> 32:14.103
and a program
oflong-term medication...

32:14.212 --> 32:17.340
you can become like me.

32:17.415 --> 32:21.283
And not
the other Eves.

32:21.353 --> 32:23.617
( rattling )

32:36.034 --> 32:39.401
Wh-What..? What haveyou done?

32:39.471 --> 32:40.995
Your soda--

32:41.106 --> 32:43.700
Four ounces offoxglove.

32:43.808 --> 32:45.036
Extracted

32:45.143 --> 32:47.043
from a digitalis plant.

32:47.112 --> 32:48.943
This much is
a lethal dose.

32:49.014 --> 32:52.108
We cultivated them
ourselves.

32:52.183 --> 32:53.980
Wh-Why?

32:54.052 --> 32:55.110
You tell us.

32:55.186 --> 32:56.653
You made us.

32:56.721 --> 32:59.554
Cindy:
We'reyour mistake.

33:01.293 --> 33:04.729
I-l'll...

33:04.796 --> 33:07.899
correct... that mistake.

33:30.088 --> 33:32.249
Well, I waited
likeyou told me.

33:32.324 --> 33:33.018
No one's come in or out
that I could tell.

33:33.091 --> 33:34.285
( glassbreaking )

33:34.359 --> 33:35.553
Get the back!

34:09.094 --> 34:10.755
We were all supposed
to drink

34:10.829 --> 34:12.888
but we only
pretended to drink it.

34:12.996 --> 34:14.965
They tried to poison us.

34:15.065 --> 34:17.091
Who's they?

34:17.202 --> 34:19.795
She and another lady.

34:19.871 --> 34:23.237
What did
the other lady look like?

34:28.545 --> 34:30.377
Eve 8.

34:30.447 --> 34:32.473
Theywere working together.

34:37.021 --> 34:38.420
It's all right.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.355
We'll take care ofyou.

34:40.425 --> 34:42.290
You're safe with us.

34:58.810 --> 35:00.710
It looks like
the Eves mixed

35:00.779 --> 35:02.542
about four ounces
ofdigitalis

35:02.614 --> 35:03.979
in each glass.

35:04.048 --> 35:05.948
Their own mini-Jonestown.

35:06.017 --> 35:08.815
Eve 6 said theywere prone
to suicide.

35:08.887 --> 35:10.445
It has a sweet favor.

35:10.522 --> 35:13.150
It's probably not even
perceptible in soda.

35:13.224 --> 35:16.193
So far, there's no sign
ofthe other suspect.

35:16.261 --> 35:19.253
We'll have an officer
take the girls back.

35:19.330 --> 35:21.093
No, maybe it would be best

35:21.199 --> 35:23.667
if we take responsibility
for the girls.

35:23.735 --> 35:26.135
We can get them
checked out by a doctor.

35:26.204 --> 35:27.432
Okay, whatever.

35:27.505 --> 35:28.938
Okay.

35:32.043 --> 35:33.169
Come on, girls.

35:33.244 --> 35:35.235
We're going
to takeyou back.

35:35.313 --> 35:36.507
Backwhere?

35:36.581 --> 35:38.572
What's going
to happen to Teena?

35:38.650 --> 35:41.244
We'll talk about it
in the car, okay?

35:47.292 --> 35:50.352
They've already grown
so attached.

35:50.462 --> 35:51.861
It will be hard

35:51.963 --> 35:54.431
when Teena's placed
in foster care.

36:18.690 --> 36:20.783
Agent Mulder, I have to
go to the bathroom.

36:20.859 --> 36:23.191
Me too.

36:23.261 --> 36:24.455
Can you hold it?

36:24.529 --> 36:26.724
I really need to go.

36:26.831 --> 36:29.425
I could use some caffeine.

36:40.845 --> 36:42.813
Mulder:
Hi.

36:42.881 --> 36:44.178
Where's your bathroom?

36:44.249 --> 36:46.649
In the back. You'll need a key.

36:46.718 --> 36:48.811
Thanks.

36:48.887 --> 36:51.117
Oh, can I get four diet sodas?

36:51.189 --> 36:52.486
- Regular.
- Regular.

36:52.557 --> 36:57.085
All right. Two diet
and two regular. To go, please.

36:57.161 --> 36:58.594
Thanks.

37:22.921 --> 37:25.651
Tina:
AgentScully, my door'sstuck.

37:25.723 --> 37:27.384
Scully:
Justasecond.

37:40.104 --> 37:41.594
just a minute.

37:41.673 --> 37:44.141
It's okay.
My dad will pay for them

37:44.208 --> 37:46.403
when he gets out
ofthe bathroom.

37:46.477 --> 37:47.774
Okay.

38:08.166 --> 38:09.724
Those are the diet?

38:09.834 --> 38:11.927
I think these are.

38:15.540 --> 38:17.508
Areyou sure? It's really sweet.

38:17.575 --> 38:18.701
Try it.

38:18.776 --> 38:20.403
It's diet.
I saw her pour it.

38:20.478 --> 38:21.877
Okay.

38:21.946 --> 38:23.413
Scully:
Let's go.

38:26.384 --> 38:27.749
Come on.

38:29.621 --> 38:31.054
Don't forget the drinks.

38:31.122 --> 38:32.646
Ah, the drinks.

38:36.494 --> 38:38.018
How much?

38:38.129 --> 38:39.153
Five dollars.

38:39.263 --> 38:40.321
Okay.

38:40.431 --> 38:41.557
Want to pay?

38:41.666 --> 38:42.724
Sure.

38:42.834 --> 38:45.200
Thereyou go.

38:45.269 --> 38:46.634
You got those?

38:46.704 --> 38:48.296
Thanks.

39:03.187 --> 39:05.018
Mmm, tastes syrupy.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.855
Cindy,
you didn't pick up my keys

39:10.962 --> 39:13.453
offthe counter, did you?

39:13.564 --> 39:14.963
No.

39:15.033 --> 39:17.661
No? All right.
I'll be right back.

39:53.171 --> 39:54.001
Scully!

39:54.672 --> 39:55.798
What?

39:55.873 --> 39:57.431
Scully...

40:00.078 --> 40:02.876
just wanted to open
the car door foryou.

40:05.316 --> 40:08.308
Mulder!

40:08.386 --> 40:10.251
It's them. They poisoned it.

40:10.321 --> 40:11.913
Let'sjust get them

40:11.989 --> 40:12.956
in the car.

40:13.024 --> 40:14.184
Okay.

40:15.460 --> 40:17.155
I only had a sip.

40:17.228 --> 40:19.924
We didn't drink enough
to make us sick.

41:12.316 --> 41:13.578
Stop it!

41:13.651 --> 41:15.448
Scully! I got them!

41:15.520 --> 41:16.452
Leave me alone!

41:16.521 --> 41:17.419
I got them!

41:17.488 --> 41:19.080
Scully!

41:19.157 --> 41:21.421
Hey!

41:22.693 --> 41:24.558
What the hell areyou doing?

41:24.629 --> 41:26.426
I'm a federal agent.

41:26.497 --> 41:29.091
And these are
America's Most Wanted?

41:29.767 --> 41:30.426
Hands in front.

41:30.535 --> 41:32.002
Leave me alone!

41:32.103 --> 41:33.730
Now let the girls go.

41:33.838 --> 41:37.001
Get in the truck, girls.
I'll call the police.

41:37.074 --> 41:38.439
We are the police!

41:50.188 --> 41:52.122
Theywent that way.

41:57.328 --> 41:59.956
You seen the twins we were with?

42:00.031 --> 42:02.192
No, l...

42:02.266 --> 42:04.427
There's a bunch ofschoolkids

42:04.535 --> 42:06.560
just left
on that bus.

42:50.648 --> 42:52.081
Forgetyour sodas?

42:52.149 --> 42:53.946
We didn't do
anything wrong.

42:54.018 --> 42:55.576
We'rejust
little girls.

42:55.653 --> 42:57.917
That's the last thingyou are.

43:03.127 --> 43:06.221
They said they have
an excellent program.

43:06.297 --> 43:07.855
Mulder:
They can't hide

43:07.932 --> 43:10.230
behind a bureaucracy,
Mrs. Reardon.

43:10.334 --> 43:13.167
You have every right to know
what happened--

43:13.237 --> 43:15.569
a right to know
aboutyour daughter.

43:15.640 --> 43:19.974
All I need to know is
she was not my daughter.

43:20.044 --> 43:22.035
She neverwas.

43:49.540 --> 43:51.474
Hello, girls.

44:06.223 --> 44:09.056
It's so nice to have company.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.731
Sign for this.

44:52.903 --> 44:54.803
Hello, Eve 8.

44:57.608 --> 44:59.075
We've been waiting.

44:59.143 --> 45:01.236
How did you know
I'd come foryou?

45:01.312 --> 45:02.836
Wejust knew.

45:02.913 --> 45:04.403
Wejust knew.
