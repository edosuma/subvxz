♪

00:32.156 --> 00:34.993
And with the industrialrevolution came millionaires

00:35.034 --> 00:38.246
who'd compete to throwthe most lavish parties

00:38.246 --> 00:39.581
and they'd try to out-doone another

00:39.581 --> 00:43.543
with their big dessertsor their huge hats.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.086
They'd even compete to see

00:45.128 --> 00:47.422
who could have the mostmagnificent mansions.

00:47.422 --> 00:54.262
One man plated his entirebathtub in 24-karat gold leaf.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.057
Imagine taking a bubble bathin that.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.267
But miss, aren't placeslike that

00:59.309 --> 01:00.769
just in fairy tales?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.437
Oh, no.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.605
No, they're very real.Trust me.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.650
In fact, I used to spendmy summers in a big mansion

01:07.692 --> 01:09.736
just like thatwhen I was your age.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.696
Well, back in the States.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.239
Lucy?

01:14.449 --> 01:16.242
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.161
Enjoy the rest of your tour.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.374
Lucy, giving children toursin the galleries again?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.710
That's what our docentsare for.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.753
Sorry, Isabelle.

01:27.045 --> 01:30.173
I was just passing throughand I guess I got pulled in.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.633
I love that exhibit.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.967
Come along.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.594
I need my director ofdevelopment upstairs.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.971
We've got to plan forthe fundraiser tonight.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.306
So catch me up where we are.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.641
Sure.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.267
So I re-workedthe seating chart.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.186
All of our major donorswill be sitting up front,

01:43.228 --> 01:46.397
and you will be between the LordMayor and Ambassador Philips.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.442
Oh, Lucy. You remind me of me.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.111
Museum directors aren't made,they're born.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.406
And you truly have the makingsof one of the greats.

01:55.448 --> 02:00.161
You know, I'm relocating backto New York soon.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.247
I can't think of anyonewho works harder than you.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.957
Thank you.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.334
Your passion and knowledgeof history is undeniable.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.586
Your organizational skillsare top-notch.

02:09.628 --> 02:13.341
Well, I've decided to nominateyou as my replacement

02:13.383 --> 02:15.552
when I retire next month.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.555
Isabelle. Really?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.932
Oh my gosh, that would bea dream come true.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.060
But before we pop the champagne,just one more hurdle.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.355
I do need to get the trusteeson board with you first.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.525
I will wear them down like...

02:30.567 --> 02:33.486
Like... like the Dukeof Wellington wore down Napoleon

02:33.528 --> 02:34.737
at Waterloo.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.864
Precisely.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.453

02:47.041 --> 02:50.253
Ok. Name tags done,catering taken care of,

02:50.295 --> 02:53.590

02:53.631 --> 02:56.509

02:56.551 --> 02:57.510
[laughs]

02:57.552 --> 02:59.387
Anything else, Josephine?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.264
Uh, that just about does it.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.308
I'd say we're ready forthe fundraiser tonight.

03:03.349 --> 03:07.103
Well then, since the newexhibit's going in downstairs,

03:07.145 --> 03:10.690
I might just sneak downfor an early peek.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.193
Boss, you're meeting the HobartFoundation at 2:00

03:13.234 --> 03:16.404
and then Lady Jacobs to naildown her gift for the east wing,

03:16.404 --> 03:18.740
and you still have to call backthat cute Cambridge professor

03:18.740 --> 03:21.159
that wants to take you outon a date.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.036
He didn't want to take meout on a date.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.663
He just wants my help writinghis grant proposal.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.583
Lucy, you're a victimof your own success.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.752
Well, I should take these downto the archives.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.544
Oh!

03:32.754 --> 03:33.755
I got it.

03:33.796 --> 03:38.259

She was a wonderful lady.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.088
She passed away last month.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.798
Oh, is that her?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.885
Yes. Aunt Grace.

05:43.926 --> 05:49.348
The kindest, most adventuroussoul you could ever meet.

05:49.390 --> 05:53.227
Wow, what a lovely estate.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.772
I'd guess Gilded Age Era.

05:55.813 --> 05:56.773
Upstate New York?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.901
Close, Rhode Island.It's called Wycliffe House.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.028
I grew up spendingmy summers there.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.488
Your Aunt lived there.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.822
Great Aunt, actually.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.908
Her husband Arthur wasthe last of the Wycliff's.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.661
His grandfather Henry builtthe house over 100 years ago.

06:10.703 --> 06:14.082
I spoke to my folks and theysaid that Arthur didn't have

06:14.082 --> 06:15.917
any remaining family

06:15.958 --> 06:20.630
so Aunt Grace bequeathedthe whole thing to me.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.298
Inheriting a mansion?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.842
That's something that doesn'thappen every day.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.805
Aunt Grace invited us up thereevery single summer

06:28.846 --> 06:31.474
until I headed off to Oxford.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.686
Now who's that?

06:35.728 --> 06:38.856
Uh, Duncan.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.275
Son of the caretakers.

06:41.275 --> 06:45.029

06:45.071 --> 06:46.823
Uh, anyway-

06:46.864 --> 06:48.616
Oh, Lucy, I hate to ask,

06:48.616 --> 06:51.953
but must you go all the wayto the States right now?

06:51.994 --> 06:55.373
The trustees meeting isjust around the corner.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.833
Apparently the way the willis written,

06:56.874 --> 07:00.503
if I don't go soon the propertygoes into a receivership

07:00.545 --> 07:02.630
and becomes a biglegal mess.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.756
I understand.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.300
Do what you need to do,but please hurry back.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.636
I know I can get the trusteesto approve you.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.263

07:12.598 --> 07:13.808

07:13.808 --> 07:15.643
Because if I don't geta successor soon

07:15.685 --> 07:18.479
they'll roast me like...

07:18.521 --> 07:19.856

the great fire of Londonin 1666.

Hello, I'm Lucy Windsor.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.559

I'm so sorry.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.192

08:04.233 --> 08:05.193
Oh, yes.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.028
How long has it been againsince you've been here?

08:07.069 --> 08:10.448
Ten years. I wanted to come backsooner to visit

08:10.490 --> 08:13.367
but work just kept me so busy.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.411
Your Aunt Grace understood.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.497
She was always so proud of you.

08:18.539 --> 08:24.837
She's sorely missed in town butshe lived a long and happy life.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.672
I just wish she werestill here.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.424

But first an old friend.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.885
It is just as beautiful aroundhere as I remember.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.972
I had so many wonderfultimes here.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.723
And as I recall you and Duncan

09:17.765 --> 09:20.977
spent a great amount of timehere together, too.

09:21.018 --> 09:25.147
You were kind of sweet oneach other if memory serves.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.108
The follies of youth.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.944
Actually, Lucy, about Duncan-

09:29.986 --> 09:31.028
It's ok, Eleanor.

09:31.320 --> 09:37.159
He's one part of all of thisthat I am happy to forget.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.965
There she is.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.259
Right where you left her.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.886
Magical.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.194
[sheep baaing]

10:14.322 --> 10:16.032
What is all this?

10:16.073 --> 10:18.659
The welcoming committee?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.203
The fence in our pastureis falling down

10:21.245 --> 10:24.498
and your Aunt Grace could neversay no to visitors.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.208
You go on in and get settled,honey.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.168
Thank you.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.961
The door sticks a little.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.005
Got it.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.396
It's a little sticky, huh?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.317
Oh!

10:55.029 --> 10:56.197
Lucy?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.699
Duncan.

10:58.699 --> 11:01.202
What're you doingin my house?

11:01.202 --> 11:06.999
Uh... Lucy, what're you doingin my house?

11:07.041 --> 11:09.377
Your house? My house.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.878
What would give you that idea?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.338
It's not an idea it's a fact.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.714
That this is my house.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.257
No, mine.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.804
Ok, I think maybe there's beensome kind of a mistake.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.264
Why wouldn't Grace tell me  that she was leaving the house

11:22.306 --> 11:25.101
to both of us?

11:25.142 --> 11:26.894
Tell you? Why wouldn'tshe tell me?

11:26.894 --> 11:28.354
I don't know, maybe becauseI've been here

11:28.396 --> 11:30.314
and you've been in London?

11:33.067 --> 11:35.069
Regardless, it's perfectlyobvious

11:35.069 --> 11:38.322
there's been some sort ofa clerical error.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.116
You changed your hair.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.412
Yeah.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.455
[baaing]

11:46.497 --> 11:48.416

11:52.878 --> 11:53.754
Oh, I've been good.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.048
I've been- I've been really,really good.

11:56.090 --> 11:56.882
Good.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.884
Good.

11:58.926 --> 12:03.431
And you uh, you- you work insome museum in London I heard?

12:03.431 --> 12:04.390
Mmmhmm.

Knock... well, knock wood.

Fancy? I don't know.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.193
I mean, I'm working for a bigcommercial firm up in Boston.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.445
I'm glad we'reall caught up.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.362
Excuse me.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.448
Eleanor, why didn't you tell meabout Duncan?

12:20.489 --> 12:21.740
I tried.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.867
You didn't wanna know.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.201
I'm gonna make some tea.

12:24.243 --> 12:28.122
Besides, it's high timeyou two buried the hatchet.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.210
Duncan.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.879
This has been lovely.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.716
I am going to go take a littlelook around.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.217
Be my guest.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.344
Or my guest.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.149
This place is still amazing.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.111
A window backto the 1890's.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.822
They don't build houseslike this anymore.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.948
And that's a good thing.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.826
Give me a modern condoany day.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.660
A place you can heat

13:06.911 --> 13:09.830
with up-to-date plumbingand electrical.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.874
It's still magical though.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.667
Yeah, it might look magical

13:13.709 --> 13:16.879
but this place is slowlyfalling apart.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.672
Note the buckets.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.841
It's seen some disrepair sincethe last time you visited,

13:20.883 --> 13:23.969
not to mention half of the roomsare already closed up.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.516
You see the problem?

13:28.557 --> 13:30.434
Yeah, I'm starting to.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.109
Grace used to hold herGilded Age Ball in here.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.988
Yep, this place has definitelyseen better days.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.240
The last two years I've beencoming down here

13:44.532 --> 13:47.076
on the weekends to help Graceout with the upkeep when I can.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.453
That's surprisingly charitableof you.

13:49.495 --> 13:53.040
A brief lapse in judgement,I assure you.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.960
But seriously, this placeis an absolute money pit

13:56.001 --> 13:59.171
and needs to be sold offat the earliest opportunity.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.215
Assuming you own it,which you don't.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.634
Which I do, and I'm wellon my way

14:03.676 --> 14:06.428
to coming up with a brilliantsales pitch for it.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.056
That is if the developer,Mr. Niven,

14:09.056 --> 14:11.016
is open to hearingmy presentation.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.476
Richard Niventhe billionaire?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.435
Ah, you've heard of him.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.397
Yeah, he specializesin building golf courses

14:16.397 --> 14:18.148
and I've heard he's interestedin opening

14:18.190 --> 14:19.400
a new one around here.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.945
Turn the estateinto a golf course? Seriously?

14:22.987 --> 14:23.863
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.950
Did- did you have a better planfor this place?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.910
Not at this exact moment

14:29.952 --> 14:32.162
but surely there must bea better option

14:32.204 --> 14:36.083
than turning a magnificentestate into some putting green.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.419
This is 1890's at its finest.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.879
The stained glass,the marble floors-

14:40.921 --> 14:42.423
Out with the old,in with the new.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.426
Oooh! Duncan, how canyou be so blind

14:45.467 --> 14:47.761
to all the history around you?

14:47.761 --> 14:50.848
How can you be so blindto the bottom line?

14:50.889 --> 14:51.932
Listen, Frank Lloyd Wrong,

14:52.182 --> 14:55.769
you are not going to movea stone of this mansion.

14:55.811 --> 15:01.775
Ok. Well thenwhat do you suggest?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.319
This has got to besome big mistake.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.946
Aunt Grace would never put me insuch an impossible situation.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.240
I suggest that we geta little clarity

15:08.282 --> 15:10.284
from H .K. Rourke,Attorney at Law,

15:10.326 --> 15:12.536
and figure this outin the morning.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.287
Fine.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.496
Fine.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.042
Which hotel are you stayingat in town?

15:18.083 --> 15:18.667
Hmm?

15:18.709 --> 15:19.460
Hmm?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.545
Hotel? No, I'm not stayingat a hotel.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.173
I'm staying in the west wing.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.425
Of my mansion.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.927
Great.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.971
Then I'll be staying inthe east wing of my mansion.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.097
Great.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.432
Mmm.

15:34.933 --> 15:35.517
I'm gonna go that wayto the east wing.

15:35.684 --> 15:35.976
Yeah, that's fine.

15:36.226 --> 15:36.352
Thank you.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.311
After you.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.188
Mmmhmm.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.106
Stop watching me leave.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.108
You stop first.

15:47.529 --> 15:52.910
[phone ringing]

15:52.951 --> 15:55.955
Lucy, how's lifeon your estate?

15:55.996 --> 15:56.830
Where do I start?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.333
It turns outDuncan is staying here, too.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.334
Duncan?

16:00.376 --> 16:01.919
His father was the caretaker.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.337
He used to live here.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.173
But he's impossible,as always.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.093
Duncan thinks he inheritedhalf the estate.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.304
Co-owners of an estate,that sounds kind of romantic.

16:12.346 --> 16:16.517
Trust me, it is the oppositeof romantic.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.894
But I have to admit,he does look pretty good.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.396
Oh, details, please.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.981
What does he look like?

16:23.023 --> 16:25.859
A little bit like our statueof Marc Antony.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.319
But with the same flairfor betrayal.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.073
He's got some scheme to turnthe place into a golf course.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.533
A golf course?

16:32.533 --> 16:33.993
Well, that seems a bit daft.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.202
Exactly.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.204
But as soon as we figurethis whole thing out

16:37.204 --> 16:37.996
with the lawyers in the morning

16:38.205 --> 16:40.165
I am going to sendDuncan packing.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.917
Well, good luck, Lucy.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.253
Thanks, Jose.I'll need it.

16:54.513 --> 17:00.602
[loud grunts]

17:05.441 --> 17:08.277
What is happening out there?

17:17.243 --> 17:21.415
Hey. Hey, Duncan.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.125
Oh, a beautifulmorning to ya.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.919
I see you're still notan early riser.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.589
You ever hear of a little thingcalled jet lag?

17:28.630 --> 17:29.590
Vaguely.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.385
But I'm happy to help youget back on to local time.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.265
Ok, look.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.100
I'm a little tired.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.935
I could really use somemore sleep.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.604
Do you have to do thatright now?

17:43.604 --> 17:45.397
Well, if you want a hot shower

17:45.439 --> 17:47.608
before we go visitthe lawyers then yes,

17:47.649 --> 17:50.778
the water heater's down so Igotta fire up the old boiler.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.446
[loud grunt]

17:53.530 --> 17:57.284
Well, can you chop more quietly,please?

17:57.326 --> 17:59.119
Oh, you bet.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.246
[loud grunt]

18:03.499 --> 18:05.375
I give up.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.423
Good morning.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.633
Eleanor.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.676
You really didn't haveto do all this.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.553
Of course I did.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.930
Oh, it's such a delight

18:17.971 --> 18:21.225
to have you and Duncan togetherhere again.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.476
We're not together.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.478
Definitely not together!

18:24.520 --> 18:28.357
Uh, bad choice of words.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.609
One lump or two?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.152
Stevia?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.741
You are H .K. Rourke.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.578
Yes, but Hannah is fine.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.746
Hi, Duncan.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.165
Hello, Hannah.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.667
So you two know each other?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.670
Duncan took me tothe Newport Regatta.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.464
Oh.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.092
How lovely.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.803
Well, please. Sit down.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.772
First, let me extendmy sympathies.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.024
Grace was a big partof our community.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.527
Thank you. I really miss her.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.653
I do, too.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.281
That's why it's a little odd tobe talking business right now.

19:17.322 --> 19:21.702
And that brings us to thequestion of what happens next.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.661
Well, Duncan,

19:22.911 --> 19:26.164
regarding that mistakethat you called me about.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.208
It's actually not a mistake.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.293
Regarding Grace's will

19:29.334 --> 19:32.379
the situation is actuallyquite clear.

19:32.379 --> 19:36.550
Simply put, you bothown the estate.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.259
What?

19:37.301 --> 19:38.844
But how can that be?

19:38.886 --> 19:39.845
What she said.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.055
Grace was quite specificin her will.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.058
She arranged that you shouldboth own 50 percent.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.561
And I'm sorry that I couldn'texplain the full situation

19:47.603 --> 19:49.438
until you had both arrived,

19:49.479 --> 19:51.982
but Grace had sworn meto secrecy.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.233
Duncan,

19:53.233 --> 19:54.484
Grace mentionedin her will how much

19:54.526 --> 19:57.112
she appreciates everythingyou and your family did

19:57.154 --> 20:01.158
for her over the years and shewanted to extend her gratitude.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.286
And Lucy, Grace knewthat you loved that place

20:04.328 --> 20:06.496
as much as she didand you would always

20:06.538 --> 20:08.415
have its best interestsat heart.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.375
Which is why it makes absolutelyno sense

20:10.417 --> 20:11.710
that Grace would do this.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.378
Well, that much we agree on.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.964
Ok, so if I own half...

20:16.006 --> 20:18.425
And I own half.

20:18.425 --> 20:23.263
Then we have to cometo some sort of agreement.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.432
Look, the truth of the matter is

20:25.432 --> 20:30.103
the house is all that's left ofthe great Wycliff fortune.

20:30.103 --> 20:35.442
There's a small stipend to payfor Eleanor but that's it.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.779
And I'm here if you guyshave any more questions.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.662
Thank you very much for takingthe time, Hannah.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.830
We appreciate it.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.751
Oh hey, Duncan, um...really good news.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.544
My client, Mr. Niven,has agreed to hear

20:54.586 --> 20:57.297
your golf course presentation.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.715
I hope it helps.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.633
Thanks.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.759
Yeah.

21:05.430 --> 21:09.601
So Hannah is the one who foundyour potential buyer?

21:09.643 --> 21:12.646
Yeah, for a small 10 percentfinder's fee.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.231
She's just trying to help.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.400
In London we'd call that a weeconflict of interest.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.361
Ok. How about we finda civilized way

21:19.403 --> 21:21.822
of ironing this all out?

21:21.863 --> 21:23.782
Over breakfast maybe?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.910
Still got a weaknessfor waffles?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.328
I'm buying.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.414
You read my mind.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.883
Pancakes and waffles.

21:41.925 --> 21:42.676
Will do, Duncan.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.510
Thank you.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.886
And for you, miss?

21:46.638 --> 21:48.974
Wait, Lucy?

21:49.016 --> 21:50.767
Randall.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.686
It's so good to see you.

21:52.686 --> 21:56.732
Hi. Wow. Duncan and Lucy.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.567
Nice to see you twotogether again.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.444
(Both): We're not together.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.571
Duncan, you didn'ttell me Lucy's back in town.

22:02.612 --> 22:06.950
Well, that's because I'm assurprised as you are, my friend.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.244
Well, welcome home, Lucy.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.704
You still like your waffleswith strawberries

22:10.746 --> 22:12.539
and a pyramid of whipped cream?

22:12.539 --> 22:15.042
You have a fantastic memory.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.168
So what've you been up to?

22:16.460 --> 22:19.713
Just working here, helpingEleanor when she has errands,

22:19.755 --> 22:21.256
helping out with the festival.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.591
You should stop byif you have time.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.675
I'd love to.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.552
Ok. I'll put this in.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.807
Randall's still a hoot.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.434
At least he had the courtesyto send me

22:32.476 --> 22:34.603
a Christmas cardevery now and again.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.355
You left the country.

22:36.396 --> 22:39.441
You never repliedto any of my letters.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.443
You know what?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.362
Water under the bridge.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.822
So how is it thatyou're still so close

22:45.864 --> 22:47.324
with everyone herein Newton?

22:47.365 --> 22:48.617
I thought you were some

22:48.658 --> 22:51.411
high-flying architectin the big city.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.372
I have been coming downto Newton every weekend

22:53.413 --> 22:57.667
for one reason and one reasononly and that is the estate.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.336
It is a monster that needsconstant feeding

22:59.377 --> 23:01.380
and I am finished with it.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.757
But that house has been herefor over 100 years.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.425
How can you turn your backon it?

23:05.425 --> 23:10.597
Easy. Look, Lucy, if we couldjust sell this estate

23:10.639 --> 23:11.765
I would have the funds to start

23:12.015 --> 23:13.975
my own architecture firmand you could go back to London

23:14.017 --> 23:16.144
with a tidy little nest egg.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.562
What do you say?

23:17.604 --> 23:19.439
But if Niven goes for it,

23:19.439 --> 23:20.941
what happens to the estate?

23:20.982 --> 23:23.443
Well, the plans that I suggestedwould see the grounds

23:23.485 --> 23:26.446
opened up for the fairwaysand we would probably have

23:26.488 --> 23:28.824
to lose the coach house,the gardens-

23:28.865 --> 23:30.617
Bulldoze the gardens?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.286
Duncan, over my dead body.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.705
Do you have any ideawhat it takes to maintain

23:35.747 --> 23:37.874
an estate like this?

23:37.916 --> 23:42.712
No, but I wanna leave itin good hands.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.797
I don't know, maybe I couldget it designated

23:44.047 --> 23:46.633
as a historical landmarkand then I could start

23:46.633 --> 23:48.593
applying for grantsto protect it.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.304
We would be lucky if Nivenpicked it up.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.639
Our other option is putting iton the market

23:52.931 --> 23:57.644
and honestly, at this rate, itwouldn't even pass inspection.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.396
Ok, so whatdo you propose?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.898
I suggest that we sell offa few odds and ends

24:01.940 --> 24:04.067
so we have the fundsto patch up the roof

24:04.109 --> 24:05.485
while we try to figure out

24:05.485 --> 24:07.612
what to do withthe rest of the place.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.865
Fine.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.116
Ooh.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.458
Did you know that Belgianwaffles were invented

24:19.499 --> 24:22.669
in the 1800's by the PrinceBishop of Liege?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.629
Nobody knows that, Lucy.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.673
[laughs]

24:26.715 --> 24:28.717
Well, what do you think,dad?

24:28.758 --> 24:30.594
My money's on Lucy.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.637
She always was headstrongas a kid.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.015
True, but Duncan'salways got a trick or two

24:35.015 --> 24:36.099
up his sleeve.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.517
It's a shame they can't just-

24:37.559 --> 24:40.729
Work together. I know.

24:40.770 --> 24:45.567
Of course, maybe theyjust need a nudge.

24:55.952 --> 25:00.123
Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.500

25:01.541 --> 25:02.292
What? No, out.

25:03.043 --> 25:03.960
Shoo. Shoo. Shoo.

25:04.002 --> 25:04.836
Shoo. Shoo.

25:04.878 --> 25:05.712

25:05.712 --> 25:06.838

25:06.880 --> 25:07.923

25:09.883 --> 25:11.092
Morning.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.719
Where's Eleanor?

25:12.719 --> 25:13.678
Uh, she left a note.

25:13.929 --> 25:17.432
She went to town to help outwith the festival

25:17.474 --> 25:19.559
and left breakfast on the stove.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.395
Meanwhile, why don'tyou put your world class

25:22.395 --> 25:25.899
architectural skills to use andfix the lock on the kitchen door

25:25.899 --> 25:28.151
so Percy will staywhere he belongs?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.945
Percy?

25:29.986 --> 25:33.240
I mean the sheep that justpushed his way into the kitchen.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.074
Why Percy?

25:34.115 --> 25:35.492
Because he's so persistent.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.953
Huh. Sounds like somebodyelse I know.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.746
I'll add it to the list.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.456
So I've totaled the amountof money we'll need

25:41.498 --> 25:44.668
for the essential fixes beforewe can even show this place.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.461
We'll need to touch upthe paint,

25:46.503 --> 25:50.632
fix some of these windows,and, of course, pay the roofers.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.717
Better get started.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.553
This house has lastedfor 100 years.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.596
I think it can make itthrough breakfast.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.974
No time like the present.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.899
Duncan. Duncan, what're youdoing with those?

26:07.941 --> 26:10.443
We need money to fixthe roof, remember?

26:10.443 --> 26:12.570
So I thought we could sell offa few of these things

26:12.612 --> 26:14.531
at the antique auctionin Newton.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.782
It's just collecting dust.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.951
But these areAunt Grace's things

26:17.993 --> 26:20.078
and Wycliffe family heirlooms.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.288
Sacrificing themselvesto keep this house

26:21.621 --> 26:24.833
from falling apart seems likethe most noble duty of all.

26:24.874 --> 26:25.792
It's just random stuff.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.626
Random stuff?

26:26.835 --> 26:28.920
That is a 19th centuryoil painting.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.963
Yeah.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.716
Of, like, trees.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.635
And that antique Venetian vaseis in perfect condition.

26:35.677 --> 26:36.845
What, this old thing?

26:36.886 --> 26:38.930
Oh!

26:38.972 --> 26:41.141
Oh, those chandeliersin the Great Hall

26:41.182 --> 26:42.642
are probably worth something.

26:42.642 --> 26:47.731
No. Duncan, I love those.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.065
Ok.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.150
How about this?

26:50.150 --> 26:50.984
We've got dozens of these.

26:51.234 --> 26:51.985
Those are emblematic ofthe fascination

26:52.444 --> 26:55.739
in the 1890's of botanyand floral history.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.991
We have to keep at least one.

26:57.991 --> 27:02.245
Ok. What is your obsessionwith history?

27:03.997 --> 27:08.001
No, those are treasures and...

27:08.043 --> 27:11.046
this is Aunt Grace's diary.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.672
We certainly can't sell that.

27:12.672 --> 27:15.675
Ok, granted, that was a mistake.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.803
What about this paintingwith the pretty girl in it?

27:23.808 --> 27:25.769
Haha, very funny.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.355
This Victorian hall standis an antique.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.690
Lucy, be practical for once.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.360
We need to fix this roof.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.903
[sighs]

27:34.944 --> 27:39.324
Ok. Fine. But make it quick.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.078
Ready?

27:46.873 --> 27:48.166
Ok.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.295
And this one?

27:55.173 --> 27:56.966
I'm proud of you.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.218
I'm going to give Randall a call

27:58.510 --> 27:59.969
and see if he can give us a handto bring this down to auction.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.056
I'm going with you to makesure you get a fair price.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.933
Deal.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.615
The 1890's were a uniquemoment in our town's history

28:20.657 --> 28:23.076
when Henry Wycliff decidedto build his estate here

28:23.118 --> 28:25.745
and ended up helping buildmuch of the town.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.914
And the Wycliff's continuedthat tradition.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.667
Henry's grandson, Arthur,and his wife, Grace,

28:30.709 --> 28:34.003
built our city park there.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.297
I have nothing but happymemories here.

No, but Hannah's the top shotin the darts contest every year

33:20.206 --> 33:21.249
What's your plan?

33:21.541 --> 33:24.836
Well, it's just that there'sso much history in this town

33:24.877 --> 33:27.672
and I realized the estatedoesn't have to be

33:27.714 --> 33:30.383
just a historical landmark.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.552
Visitors can step back in time.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.639

Well, if anyone can makeit happen it's you.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.291
Ah.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.626
So you've been researchingmy idea.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.087
Guess my plan's got youa little intrigued.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.381
Yeah, guilty. Intrigued.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.801
At how completely impracticalyou still are.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.554
But just for argument's sake,

36:21.596 --> 36:23.181
how would you possiblyfund this?

36:23.222 --> 36:24.599
I'm going to devote partof the house

36:24.640 --> 36:27.518
to showcase antique vendorsand local craftspeople

36:27.560 --> 36:30.271
from town and we couldsell their goods here.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.689
It's called revenue.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.565
Revenue.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.399
Mmmhmm.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.734
And that revenue would beenough to keep

36:34.775 --> 36:37.570
this entire place running?

36:37.612 --> 36:39.322
I think it's worth a try.

36:39.363 --> 36:43.284
I think you still gotyour head up in the clouds.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.745
[turns music back on]

36:45.786 --> 36:49.248
♪

36:49.290 --> 36:50.249
Alright, you know what?

36:50.249 --> 36:51.500
If we're going to sharethis estate

36:51.542 --> 36:53.628
then maybe we should setsome house rules.

36:53.669 --> 36:54.545
Great idea.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.589
For starters how aboutno drying your laundry

36:56.589 --> 36:58.841
on the priceless antiques?

36:58.883 --> 36:59.926
Fine.

37:00.217 --> 37:04.597
If you agree to no more thanone hour of your music a day.

37:04.639 --> 37:05.848
Fine.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.224
Now, if that's all,

37:07.266 --> 37:09.727
we are due at the pubfor dinner tonight.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.479
We?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.189
Look, I said yesfor both of us.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.273
I couldn't help it.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.399
Yeah, that's great.I'm starving.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.443
I'll see you downstairsin five minutes.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.623
Well, look who's here.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.792
Our guests of honor.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.001
What's all this?

37:34.043 --> 37:35.044
It's nothing.

37:35.336 --> 37:39.298
Just a little dinner to welcomeyou back home to Newton.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.467
You didn't have to do this.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.593
Nonsense.

37:42.635 --> 37:46.389
You two are officiallyour guests of honor.

37:48.307 --> 37:49.392
Thank you.

37:50.768 --> 37:51.811
I sense a trap.

37:52.103 --> 37:58.359
So I hope these rumors aren'ttrue of selling the estate

37:58.401 --> 38:00.861
and high-tailing it out of town.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.739
You wanna take this one?

38:06.492 --> 38:08.202
We're still trying to figurethings out,

38:08.244 --> 38:15.126
but I am working on a planto save the old place.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.712
Well, Wycliff Houseis this town's heritage

38:17.753 --> 38:20.214
and I can't think of anyonebetter than you two

38:20.256 --> 38:22.383
to watch over it.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.552
To Wycliff House.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.971
[together] To Wycliff House.

38:28.764 --> 38:29.640
You know, Lucy,

38:29.890 --> 38:32.852
I remember allthose summers you visited Grace.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.229
You always seemedso at home here.

38:35.271 --> 38:39.025
Name one thing that Londonhas that we don't have here.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.777
Ok, uh...

38:41.819 --> 38:42.987
the museums.

38:43.029 --> 38:43.738
[laughs]

38:43.946 --> 38:45.865
I'd say this whole townis a museum.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.324
[laughter]

38:47.366 --> 38:48.826
Can't argue that.

38:51.370 --> 38:56.625
Look, all joking aside,I love it here.

38:56.667 --> 39:00.046
But my dream job iswaiting for me back in England.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.505
Dream job, huh?

39:01.547 --> 39:05.301
Well, I'll admit a dream job'spretty serious.

39:05.342 --> 39:10.389
But desserts like thisonly come once in a lifetime.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.474
Desserts?

39:12.641 --> 39:15.394
(Group): Oooh.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.022
Truly, you didn't haveto do all this.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.441
Oh, but we did.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.153
See, your Aunt Grace has helpedevery single person in this town

39:24.195 --> 39:27.948
in one way or another and Marcusand I got engaged at the ball

39:27.990 --> 39:30.409
that your aunt used to throwevery year

39:30.409 --> 39:32.912
and Randall learned to rideat your stables

39:32.953 --> 39:35.831
and it's high timethat we repaid the favor.

39:35.873 --> 39:36.999
Welcome back.

39:37.041 --> 39:37.917
Welcome back.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.668
Welcome back, Lucy.

39:45.966 --> 39:49.428
I love this part of the estate.

39:49.428 --> 39:52.723
I had forgotten how hospitableeveryone is in this town.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.976
Yeah, some thingsnever change.

39:56.018 --> 39:56.977
I'm starting to get the feeling

39:57.228 --> 40:01.690
that they're trying to convinceus to stay.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.944
Well, I could think of worsethings than staying.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.120
You hear that?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.956
What?

40:16.956 --> 40:23.587
The sound of the cricketsinstead of us squabbling.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.756
It's pretty nice.

40:29.385 --> 40:32.304
Hey, tell me something.

40:32.304 --> 40:37.977
What happened that last summerwe were here together?

40:38.018 --> 40:40.312
You were headed offto grad school.

40:40.312 --> 40:45.651
You were gonna be thousandsof miles away.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.778
How could it have worked?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.990
So you just cut and ran?

40:50.990 --> 40:52.867
It was the practicalthing to do.

40:52.908 --> 40:53.826
Mmm.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.036
Practical. Again.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.456
Someone had to be.

40:58.497 --> 41:02.334
You were always the dreamer.

41:02.334 --> 41:07.465
Ok, look. I... I know my ideais just a pipe dream

41:07.506 --> 41:08.507
and you're right.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.510
It does take forever to geta historical designation

41:11.510 --> 41:15.723
but I can't just sit byand watch all of this go away.

41:15.764 --> 41:21.020
This estate is home to way toomany happy memories for me and-

41:21.020 --> 41:21.896
and Aunt Grace-

41:21.937 --> 41:24.064
I miss Grace, too.

41:24.106 --> 41:26.901
You forget, I lived hereyear round.

41:26.942 --> 41:30.029
I know every inchof this place.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.822
I grew up here.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.366
I went to Bostonto start over

41:34.408 --> 41:36.869
but Grace needed my helpand this estate

41:36.869 --> 41:38.787
and all of its needs keptcalling me back

41:38.829 --> 41:40.498
over and over and over.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.958
I need to be done with it.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.045
This firm is the most importantthing to me.

41:46.045 --> 41:49.048
I've always been focusedon the past

41:49.048 --> 41:52.092
and you've always been focusedon the future.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.933
Who says historyhas to repeat itself?

41:58.974 --> 41:59.934
What do you mean?

41:59.975 --> 42:01.060
Ok, well let's face it.

42:01.101 --> 42:03.854
A house dividedcannot stand.

42:03.896 --> 42:04.772
Go on.

42:05.064 --> 42:09.944
I want a historical site,you want a golf course.

42:09.985 --> 42:12.238
Why can't we have both?

42:12.279 --> 42:15.491
I am not following you.

42:15.532 --> 42:18.577
How about a resortthat showcases history?

42:18.619 --> 42:22.498
It's the best of both worlds.

42:22.539 --> 42:23.916
Interesting.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.961
But Niven is expecting a golfcourse, plain and simple.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.545
But he's a business man,

42:28.587 --> 42:30.798
and we'd be doubling thepotential revenue stream

42:30.839 --> 42:33.092
and preserving history.

42:33.092 --> 42:36.720
More tourists flockto this town every year.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.097
That's an opportunity.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.098
True.

42:39.098 --> 42:42.184
And we could hold Grace'sGilded Age Ball

42:42.226 --> 42:43.477
just like she used to do

42:43.519 --> 42:45.479
and really show offthe estate to Niven

42:45.521 --> 42:47.189
the way it's meant to be seen.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.899
That seems very ambitious.

42:48.941 --> 42:53.988
We have two daysto come up with a sales pitch.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.031
What do you think?

42:59.451 --> 43:03.247
A golf course that doublesas a history park.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.499
Yeah, why not?

43:05.541 --> 43:06.625
Maybe it's the moonlight

43:06.625 --> 43:11.588
but I think you might beon to something.

43:11.630 --> 43:14.049
Deal?

43:14.091 --> 43:16.802
Deal.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.847
[laughs]

43:26.812 --> 43:28.606
So the fountain stays put.

43:28.647 --> 43:29.398
That's right.

43:29.648 --> 43:30.399
And we won't haveto move a stone.

43:30.858 --> 43:35.154
And then the Great Hallbecomes our grand lobby.

43:35.195 --> 43:37.781
We make a pretty good team.

43:37.823 --> 43:39.825
Like Hamilton and Burr.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.619
Before all that unpleasantness.

43:42.661 --> 43:45.122
Sure. What's next?

44:28.999 --> 44:29.917
You know, for an architect

44:30.167 --> 44:31.794
you have some prettygood hands-on skills.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.922
Thanks. My dad used to let mehelp him fix things

44:34.963 --> 44:36.256
around the house.

44:36.298 --> 44:38.217
Do you know that Aunt Graceand Arthur

44:38.217 --> 44:42.137
were married hereon the estate?

44:42.179 --> 44:45.307
I wonder how many other weddingsthis property has seen.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.017
Weddings.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.895
That's not a bad ideato add to the proposal.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.855
Yeah.

44:51.897 --> 44:57.903
You know, courtship in the late1800's was truly fascinating.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.656
A gentleman's invitation toa dance was often delivered

45:00.697 --> 45:04.952
to a lady in a letter to avoidany misunderstanding,

45:04.993 --> 45:09.665
and suitors would woo theirbeloved with moonlit serenades

45:09.706 --> 45:13.127
and poetry and acts of chivalry,of course.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.378
Sounds exhausting.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.088
[laughs]

45:16.088 --> 45:17.923
Will you help me move this,please?

45:17.965 --> 45:20.300
Sure.

45:20.342 --> 45:21.802
Oh, watch out!

45:32.229 --> 45:34.148
Chivalrous.

45:35.607 --> 45:38.235
Well, I think I'm gonna gowash up

45:38.277 --> 45:43.782
and then what do you say we headto the festival?

45:43.824 --> 45:46.160
Perfect. We can spread the wordabout the ball.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.665
Oh, it is so greatthat you're bringing back

45:51.707 --> 45:53.250
Grace's Gilded Age Ball.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.377
Well, it is the finaleof our pitch to Niven

45:55.419 --> 45:57.045
to preserve Wycliff House.

45:57.087 --> 45:58.297
Give me those.

45:58.338 --> 46:00.215
I'll put these up around town.

46:00.257 --> 46:03.469
That'll show Niven whatWycliff means to this town.

46:03.469 --> 46:04.470
Take a shot, folks.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.971
Take a shot,and win a prize.

46:05.971 --> 46:08.307
Come on. Take a shotand win a prize.

46:08.348 --> 46:11.852
Take home a beautiful antiquevase from the Gilded Age.

46:11.894 --> 46:14.897
Miss, what about you?

46:14.938 --> 46:15.856
Oh, no, no, no.

46:15.898 --> 46:16.940
Thank you very much.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.358
Come on, Lucy. It looks fun.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.195
I bet you picked up some skillsback in England.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.489
The only targets I'mused to hitting these days

46:23.489 --> 46:26.074
are third quarter donations. No.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.367
Thank you. No thank you.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.327
I get it.

46:28.368 --> 46:30.996
You're scared.That's cool.

46:30.996 --> 46:33.332
Scared?

46:33.332 --> 46:38.378
Ok. Since you put itthat way,

46:38.420 --> 46:40.339
I'll take two turns.

46:40.380 --> 46:43.175
I'll show you who is scared.

46:51.517 --> 46:51.850
Blech!

46:52.017 --> 46:52.726
What was that?

46:53.101 --> 46:54.269
Your technique isall over the place.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.313
Look, may I?

46:57.523 --> 47:00.150
So, the thing with darts is

47:00.192 --> 47:05.405
you gotta line it upfrom your shoulders.

47:05.447 --> 47:08.450
Raise your elbow.

47:08.492 --> 47:09.785
Good to go.

47:09.827 --> 47:14.248
Alright. Here goes.

47:14.289 --> 47:15.916
Hey, look who's here.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.210
Looks like you're getting intothe spirit of things, Lucy.

47:18.252 --> 47:19.461
We're just taking a break

47:19.503 --> 47:21.213
from the estate to enjoythe festival.

47:21.213 --> 47:22.923
You know what?This does look like fun.

47:22.965 --> 47:23.882
I'm gonna play, too.

47:24.216 --> 47:27.219
Hannah, you clear outall my prizes every year.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.054
Thank you.

47:36.144 --> 47:38.313
Duncan's been reallymysterious lately,

47:38.355 --> 47:40.190
what have you two been up to?

47:40.232 --> 47:43.235
Just trying to do what's bestfor our place.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.904
Well, I've set up the perfectopportunity for you.

47:45.946 --> 47:48.198
I hope you're ready for Niven.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.618
Maybe your sales pitch is moreon target than your dart game.

47:57.082 --> 48:01.920
And then you can be done withthe estate and head back home.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.339
That is still the plan,isn't it?

48:04.381 --> 48:06.925
Yes.

48:06.967 --> 48:09.136
Yes, it is.

48:09.177 --> 48:12.472
Don't feel bad, Lucy.It's an acquired skill.

48:16.435 --> 48:20.230
You know, at Oxford we startwith our weaker hand

48:20.272 --> 48:22.608
when we play freshmen.

48:25.444 --> 48:28.947
[applause]

48:28.989 --> 48:31.909
It won me a round or two.

48:31.950 --> 48:35.037
Ooh, thank you.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.166
That's nice.

48:40.334 --> 48:43.503
♪

48:43.545 --> 48:44.671
Uh, that was amazing.

48:44.713 --> 48:46.506
[laughing]

48:46.548 --> 48:49.885
I'm glad my post-gradcame in handy for something.

but I'm trying to round up

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.157
all of the trustees foryour conference call later

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.992
but everyone's in differenttime zones.

01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:06.829
One's traveling in Dubai,another in Singapore...

01:01:06.871 --> 01:01:08.164
I'll keep you posted.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:09.165
Great.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.626
I'm just juggling a few thingshere but I'll be ready.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.170
(Duncan): Lucy, the caterers are here I need your help!

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.714
Sounds like a gentleman caller awaits.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:18.132
I have to get readyfor the ball.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.635
Have fun, and I'll give youone hour heads up

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.387
before your call sothat you can get settled.

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:23.179
Perfect.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.180
Thanks, Josephine.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.431
Bye.

[classical music plays]♪

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:46.911
I would have invitedyou by sending a letter

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:49.330
but I was worriedthat it would take too...

01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.924
You look amazing.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.552
You look pretty nice yourself.

01:02:02.593 --> 01:02:04.929
Thanks. I um, I borrowedthis from Randall.

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.682
I'm feeling a littleoverdressed.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:11.269
Don't. It suits you.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.024
Shall we?

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:22.864
May I introduce our hostsfor the evening,

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.991
Lucy and Duncan ofWycliff House.

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:31.456
[applause]

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:34.125
Lucy, aren't you a vision?

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.169
Oh, your aunt would be so happy

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.296
there's dancing inthe ballroom again.

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:39.964
Thank you, Eleanor.

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:42.842
You know, I would take thisover some stuffy donor's

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:46.804
cocktail party any day.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.181
I don't see Niven.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:50.057
Lucy, it's time.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:53.853
Your aunt always openedthe gala with a few words.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:03.529
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:06.407
Hey.

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:17.335
Thank you allfor coming tonight.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.754
Before our evening beginsI want to share with you

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:23.132
something my Aunt Gracealways told me.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:26.969
How her grandfather-in-law,Henry Wycliff,

01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:32.600
felt that this housewas for everyone.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.978
Here the gardenermight find himself at dinner

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:41.359
eating peach pie next toPresident Grover Cleveland.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.820
Henry opened his doorsto all

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:48.074
and my Aunt Grace would beso happy to know

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:53.204
that we're keepingthat spirit alive tonight.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:56.457
I'm not sure I can followin my Aunt Grace's footsteps

01:03:56.499 --> 01:04:01.212
but I will try my best.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:07.301
And on that note, letthe first dance begin.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:12.056
[applause]

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:14.016
You ready?

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:16.269
Ready as I'll ever be.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.113
You ok?

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:29.407
Everyone is staring.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.785
You're right, but I thinkthey're staring at me.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:36.122
Wondering how I got sucha beautiful dance partner.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:54.181
[classical music playing]♪

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:57.393
So you're due backin London next week.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.857
Well, I suppose everygood fairytale

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:05.943
has to have an ending.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:07.903
Maybe.

01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:12.283
Being back here, I've rememberedsome history.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.410
What?

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:18.372
How happy I used to be here.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.292
How happy I am now.

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:26.088
[phone alert]

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.011
What is it?

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.221
Josephine's been texting.I missed it.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:34.889
Sorry, Duncan.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.183
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.605
[sheep baas]

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:52.573
Josephine.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.742
I am so sorry I missedyour call.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:58.245
It was so noisy here I couldn'thear the phone ring.

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:00.623
Lucy, are you ready?

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:03.042
Yeah. For when?

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:07.421
Uh... for now?

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:11.050
Your conference callwith the trustees?

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.969
[baaing]

01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:16.514
Hi everybody.

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:22.228
Uh, Lucy, is that a sheepbehind you?

01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:23.771
Yep.

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:29.318
And now I'd like to talk youthrough some numbers.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.164
How'd it go?

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:46.210
Honestly... not great.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.128
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.379
Between the sheep, the music,

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.131
and keeping them waitingan hour,

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.340
it was kind of a disaster.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:52.758
[laughs]

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:58.681
But the good news is at leastI can finally relax now.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.558
How about a dance?

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:03.185
That sounds great.

01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:06.105
Thank you for a trulywonderful evening.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.315
Let me read over your proposaland run the numbers

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:12.153
and I'll have an answer for youby 8:30 tomorrow morning.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.362
Good night.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.613
Good night.

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:16.615
Good night. After you.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.244
No pressure.

01:07:20.244 --> 01:07:22.621
No pressure at all.

01:07:31.255 --> 01:07:35.593
8:30, right on time.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:38.345
Duncan, whatever happens,

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.638
I really wanna thank you

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.141
for trying to do somethingnoble here

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:46.437
and meeting me halfway.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:49.815
I would say we makea pretty great team.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.199
Great party last night.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.160
And I went over thenumbers afterwards.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.453
I like the property.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.289
Like the views,like the town.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:06.332
But I'm a straight shooter.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.418
I'm afraid restoring this estateto its former glory

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.212
would simply costs too much.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:14.131
This place likely needs updatedplumbing, mechanical,

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:15.716
electrical, and other things

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.636
we'd only be able to guess atright now.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.555
So for a full and modernrestoration,

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:25.684
I'm sorry, I'm afraidthe numbers just don't work.

01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:27.685
The most cost-effectivesolution would be

01:08:27.728 --> 01:08:28.813
a simple tear-down

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:32.066
and building a brand newgolf course from the ground up.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.651
And I assume that's whatyou'd be proposing-

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:37.071
Sir, you're not seeingthe bigger potential.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:37.947
No, I'm sorry.

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:41.408
My heart says yesbut the numbers say no.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.993
And the numbersalways win.

01:08:44.036 --> 01:08:46.705
I'm afraid my answer is no.

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.249
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:51.669
Will you guys just excuse usfor a moment, please?

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.675
Let me walk you to your car.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.718
Thank you.

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:23.117
(Hannah): Duncan, I told you this would happen.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.536
I delivered you a buyer on a  silver platter and all you had

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:28.037
to do was go along with the plan.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.372
I told Niven that you would be

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:30.707
presenting himwith a golf course.

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:33.210
And we gave him one.And more.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.712
Look, Lucy and I thought that-

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.380
You and Lucy?

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.465
You promised to get Lucyon board.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.801
Not throw me overboard.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.386
Look, you said it yourself.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.889
It was fine to tear down the estate if that's what it took

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:45.890
to make the sale.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:50.603
Yes, yes, I said it was fineto tear down the estate,

01:09:50.644 --> 01:09:52.729
but now I think we havea better option.

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:55.566
Which Niven doesn't want.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.234
Ok, look. We have about a dayto sell Niven

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.444
on the plan that he expected.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:02.698
I suggest that you come up withsomething to change his mind.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.201
[door slams]

01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:08.245
Just give me a second.

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:11.749
Lucy!

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.091
So you're still fine tearingdown the entire place?

01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:25.512
Were you- were you just snoopingon me?

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:29.642
Echo-y halls, remember?

01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:33.729
Yeah, I uh- I promised Hannahthat I'd try to convince you

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:37.733
to sell to Niven.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:41.570
To level the estatefor a golf course.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:45.491
Well, it just- it felt like themost practical plan at the time-

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:46.533
Practical.

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:49.536
Again, more proof we werenever right for each other.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:53.707
I don't know why I'mso surprised, Duncan.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:56.460
You always do what's rightfor you.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.383
Wait, that's not... Lucy...

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.968
Lucy.

01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:17.439
[phone alert]

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.527
There might be hope for us yet,Duncan.

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:22.653
I'm not so sure about that.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:25.197
Lucy just texted, she's willingto give us carte blanche

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:26.740
to do whatever we wantwith the estate.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:27.533
Just now?

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:29.410
This improvesour hand immensely.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.829
It should be easy to finda buyer now.

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.372
Who wants to tear downthe estate.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:38.377
Duncan, you said that you wantedto be free of this place.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.212
This is your chance.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.756
A chance to move onto something new.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:45.009
You'll have enough to set upyour own firm in Boston

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.886
just like you hoped.

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:50.723
It's time to thinkabout the future.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:03.610
[phone rings]

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:14.246
Isabelle. I am so sorryabout last night.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:17.207
Why would you need to apologize?

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:20.461
Well, after the wholeteleconference fiasco.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.838
Yes, well, Lucy, your spreadsheets spoke

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.714
for themselves.

01:12:23.964 --> 01:12:25.382
So I hope you're gettinga chance to relax

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:26.508
because when you get back

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:29.511
you'll have somebig shoes to step into.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:30.888
Which shoes?

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.556
Specifically mine.

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:35.476
The trustees votedto approve you.

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:36.727
You're kidding?

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:39.938
There'll be a boost in salary, of course.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.856
That's wonderful.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.566
Yes, and we'll discuss itall on Monday

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:45.277
when you're back in London.

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.404
You need an answer now?

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:50.866
Lucy, perhaps youdon't understand.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:51.742
The trustees approved you.

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.660
You got the job you wanted.

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.872
The one a million peoplewould kill for.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:58.207
Yes.

01:12:58.248 --> 01:13:02.377
No, um... of course,I'm as happy as...

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:05.839
As Alexander when he conqueredEgypt in 332 B.C.?

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.382
Yes.

01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:11.261
No, exactly.

01:13:11.303 --> 01:13:14.848
I gladly accept the job,Isabelle.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:15.891
Thank you.

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:18.852
And I will see you tomorrowwhen I fly back to London.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.187
Good.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.731
Bye-bye.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:39.373
Oh, Lucy. You're up early.

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:43.043
I was wondering if you couldgive me a ride to the airport?

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:47.422
Oh. Of course.

01:13:47.464 --> 01:13:51.844
I didn't know you were goingback to England so soon.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:53.846
Honestly, neither did I.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:14:00.769
Well, um, just let me finish uphere and I'll get my coat

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.896
and I'll be right with you.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.773
Ok.

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:17.119
Marcus, we got a problem.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.883
I'm really gonna missthis place.

01:14:30.924 --> 01:14:34.511
And you'll be missedin Newton.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:36.638
So how long is your flight back?

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.017
Door to doorabout 10 hours but uh,

01:14:40.058 --> 01:14:42.519
I brought some reading.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.730
Aunt Grace's diary.

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:47.357
I thought I'd take it backwith me as a keepsake.

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:49.943
I think Grace would haveliked that.

01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:59.536
Goodbye, Lucy.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:01.705
Goodbye.

01:15:25.812 --> 01:15:27.523
Something wrong, Duncan?

01:15:27.564 --> 01:15:29.608
You usually wolf downmy Monte Cristo sandwich

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.693
in two seconds flat.

01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:36.240
Niven flies off in about an hourand I need to finish this pitch.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.533
You know, Eleanor just called

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:39.910
to tell me Lucy leftfor the airport.

01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:44.081
She left?

01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:53.674
Headstrong as always.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:56.176
Who's the headstrong one here?

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.427
And proud, as well.

01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:59.429
You think I'm being proud?

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:01.598
She won't even give me a chanceto explain.

01:16:01.598 --> 01:16:03.767
You let her go once.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:05.894
Are you gonna let her slipthrough your fingers again?

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:06.895
What choice do I have?

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:10.023
Go stop her.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:13.569
I don't think she wantsto see me right now.

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:19.950
You know, your dad and Iwere good friends.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:24.955
If he was here I'm pretty surewhat he'd say.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.832
What's that?

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:28.792
Being caretaker of the estate

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:32.838
was more than justchanging lightbulbs.

01:16:32.879 --> 01:16:37.634
Your dad thought he was acaretaker of something precious.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:40.220
He knew some thingswere worth saving.

01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:59.865
Randall? I've got a job for you.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:31.021
Lucy, Lucy, hey wait!

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.023
Duncan,what're you doing here?

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.691
I need to talk to you.

01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:36.026
I couldn't let you go backto London again

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:39.738
without you understanding.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:44.368
I never wanted to let you gothat last summer.

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:46.036
I know.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:49.790
I... I read Aunt Grace's journal

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:54.878
and her descriptions of howyou waited for me

01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:56.463
every summer before I arrived

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:02.219
and how sad you wereevery summer after I left.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.846
I need you to give meone more chance.

01:18:04.888 --> 01:18:06.139
A chance for what?

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:08.809
I've been working on thisproposal for Niven.

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.019
It's a long shot but I thinkhe might just go for it.

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:15.273
Would you just postponeyour flight for one more day?

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:16.858
I don't know, Duncan.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:20.862
You were right, it does seema little impractical.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.202
Letting you go was the mostpractical decision

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:30.497
that I have ever made.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:34.751
It's also the worst decisionof my entire life.

01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:38.755
Now I'm asking youto trust me.

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:40.048
Please.

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:49.725
What did you have in mind?

01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:52.018
I will tell you all about iton the way back.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:56.064
But right now I believe we havea billionaire to catch.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:57.816
Ok.

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.118
Right, no, I understand

01:19:08.326 --> 01:19:11.121
Mr. Niven's timeis incredibly limited.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:14.249
Ok. We will certainly try.

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:15.250
Thank you so much.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.460
Yeah.

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:17.544
Bye-bye.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:21.173
Ok, so Niven is flying outto Aspen to meet his grandkids

01:19:21.214 --> 01:19:23.008
but his assistant said thatwe might be able to catch him

01:19:23.049 --> 01:19:25.302
before he checks out of hishotel and heads to the airport

01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:27.345
but he's leaving very soon.

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:31.391
You my ride?

01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:37.189
Yes sir. That I am.

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:40.233
(Lucy): Shoot, it's the festival. I forgot.

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:45.030
(Duncan): It's the last day. We'll have to go on foot.

01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:46.907
(Lucy): Alright.

01:19:51.411 --> 01:19:53.455
Oh, wow. We gotta hurry.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.290
Ok, come on. Follow me.

01:19:55.999 --> 01:19:56.416
Excuse me.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.167
Excuse us.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:58.543
Excuse me.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.088
Oh, this is impossible.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:02.589
Sorry.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.507
Sorry.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.926
Listen, young man, I've gota plane waiting for me.

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:09.846
I just can't figure it out.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:12.182
It's never happened before.

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:13.975
I probably just floodedthe engine.

01:20:14.017 --> 01:20:16.061
I'll have it up and runningin no time.

01:20:20.023 --> 01:20:22.234
Hey, Duncan, hold up.Come here.

01:20:27.864 --> 01:20:29.157
How much?

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:37.582
Ah, look at that.

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.709
Ready to go.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:41.378
Unless, do you wannagrab a bite?

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.546
I know a greatrestaurant nearby.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:45.006
Just drive, please.

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:46.091
Right.

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:49.553
Mr. Niven!

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.430
Do you have just a minuteor two?

01:20:59.145 --> 01:21:02.482
Look, I appreciate your effortsbut you need to understand that

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.068
I'm not in the habit ofreconsidering an offer

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.194
I've already turned down.

01:21:06.486 --> 01:21:10.282
Right, but we're not talkingabout a purchase anymore,

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:13.827
we're talking about a smallseed investment.

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:16.496
Less risk for you,much more return.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:17.998
Now, you told us that your heartsaid yes

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.000
but the numbers said no,right?

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:23.378
Well, now I think you'll findthe numbers say yes.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.297
I was able to re-worksome of the renovation costs

01:21:25.338 --> 01:21:27.841
and save us some money soafter an initial investment

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:32.262
we can renovate as we gofunded solely by profits.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:34.055
It's all in here.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.811
I'll look at it on the plane.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.479
But even assuming your numbersadd up why would

01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:44.316
I want to invest ina historical resort?

01:21:44.357 --> 01:21:46.902
For a reason you can'tput a price on.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:48.778
Preserving your legacy.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.448
You're a grandfather, right?

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:53.116
Ok, well how do you wantyour grandkids

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:54.993
to remember their grandpa?

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:57.245
As the generous man whoput them through college.

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:58.663
[laughs]

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:01.875
My aunt used to tell me storiesabout another generous man.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.294
A railroad baron namedHenry Wycliff

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:05.921
who was a very wealthy man

01:22:05.962 --> 01:22:07.964
but he also wanted everyonearound him

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:09.799
to live rich lives, too.

01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:13.803
He built this whole town.Its parks, its library.

01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:16.931
His spirit is everywhere here.

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:20.143
You can see for yourself.It's all in here.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.978
People still rememberhis generosity

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.274
and if you have the visionto help preserve his legacy

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:29.819
then maybe in 100 yearsfrom now

01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:34.532
people will be remembering youwith the same fondness.

01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:37.994
That's the great thingabout history.

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.288
It lasts forever.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.168
I'll be in touch.

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.466
Let's go.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:20.286
I just got off the phonewith Hannah.

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:23.998
I think you may havejust sold him on it.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:28.336
Well, convincing donorswas my job.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:30.505
Was?

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.298
I realized something.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.384
My future isn't in some office

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.594
five stories abovethe exhibits I love

01:23:36.636 --> 01:23:40.432
doing spreadsheets.

01:23:40.473 --> 01:23:43.518
My future is here.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.021
So you'll stay?

01:23:47.063 --> 01:23:49.232
This is where I belong.

01:23:49.232 --> 01:23:54.696
My home is hereand so is my heart.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:51.669
Great, thank you.

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:57.717
[sighs]

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.219
Not bad.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.138
Not bad at all.

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:04.682
So how does it feel to haveyour architectural office

01:25:04.724 --> 01:25:07.227
in your own house?

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.478
My house?

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.563
Wait a second,I thought this was your house.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:14.359
[laughs]

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.361
It's our house.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.863
It's our house.
