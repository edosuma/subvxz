Previously on Siren.

00:05.210 --> 00:06.370
It looks like a person.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.995
A person in a place

00:08.000 --> 00:09.206
impossible to reach
without gear.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.030
What do you think it means?

00:11.040 --> 00:13.076
Riclq, is there something
you're not telling me?

00:13.080 --> 00:15.992
Helen's made contact
with our kind.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.070
[Beth] You're telling me
they're in Bristol Cove?

00:18.080 --> 00:21.208
Do you think
the group was capable
of murdering my father?

00:21.210 --> 00:24.031
They'd do anything
to protect the secret.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.280
They will be watching.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.206
[Ben] It'll be okay.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.030
We can't let them
see everything.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.450
Not dark anymore.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.202
Whatever you were
exposed to down there,

00:35.210 --> 00:37.201
it helped.

00:37.210 --> 00:39.280
This pattern of you
not trusting me's
getting really old.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.110
What am I supposed
to tell my C.O.?

00:41.120 --> 00:43.327
Tell him that the mission
was a success.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.376
I'm on your side.

00:44.380 --> 00:46.109
I need you to remember that.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.281
[dramatic music]

00:55.120 --> 00:56.371
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:59.210 --> 01:00.416
Thanks for meeting me.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.069
Yeah. Tell me you got
something more interesting

01:02.080 --> 01:04.162
than a pileup on the I-5.

01:04.170 --> 01:06.456
Interesting enough
that people in high places
want it buried.

01:06.460 --> 01:07.449
Oh, yeah?

01:07.460 --> 01:09.109
Take a look at that.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.168
Tell me
if it's the real thing.

01:15.290 --> 01:16.325
Who is it?

01:16.330 --> 01:18.116
No clue.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.530
It was taken the night
the Klesco drill rig went down.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.110
Underwater at the site.

01:22.420 --> 01:26.242
Lighting, shadow, proportions.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.535
There's no breaks
in the footage.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.110
_ Doesn't look like
It was computer generated.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.111
So it's authentic?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.202
Well, it hasn't been doctored,
if that's what you're asking.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.451
How deep
did you say this was?

01:36.460 --> 01:38.371
About 2,500 feet.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.075
No human could dive that deep.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.070
I think somebody
must be messing with you.

01:44.380 --> 01:46.496
-Can you enhance it?
-Mm-hmm.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.489
Who are you?

[soft music]

02:14.380 --> 02:15.415
Morning.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.240
Ben and Maddie are better.

02:21.380 --> 02:22.369
Yeah.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.577
Going to that place,
I feel like myself again.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.199
Thank you

02:30.210 --> 02:31.325

03:31.670 --> 03:33.240
Helen?

03:33.250 --> 03:34.660
I had an unexpected visitor.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.410
Who's the lucky guy?

03:36.420 --> 03:37.569
You'll never guess.

out of the blue.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.378
Imagine my surprise.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.245
But, apparently,
we share

03:50.250 --> 03:52.616

of classic film.

He's upstairs.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.240

Uh, Ben, uh...

04:18.540 --> 04:19.700
Everything okay?

04:21.380 --> 04:23.530
These people I met,
the ones like me,

04:23.540 --> 04:25.451
I think they
may be dangerous.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.286
There are things
you should know.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.531
Ryn, I made some tea.

04:34.330 --> 04:35.319
Ryn?

04:38.620 --> 04:40.417
What is this?

04:40.420 --> 04:43.412
It is almost time
to make baby.

04:45.330 --> 04:46.570
Mating season.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.458
This is what happens?
You glow?

04:50.460 --> 04:51.575

05:25.750 --> 05:27.320
Not now.

05:28.330 --> 05:29.490

We choose partner.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.411
Good you are here.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.741
We will go back in water
when I am ready.

05:42.420 --> 05:43.409
You and Levi?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.320

Another problem, too.

We are many seasons
without babies.

_ Birthrates are down
In almost all marine mammals.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.609
Why?

06:06.620 --> 06:07.700
Lot of reasons.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.701
Pollution, global warming.

I'm so sorry, Ryn.

06:13.830 --> 06:16.537
We could run tests
on both of you.

Try to find out
what the problem is
before you go back.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.490
Ben can fix.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.706
Maybe.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.701
We can try to figure out
what's going on.

06:49.620 --> 06:50.826
I mean, you got yourself
into this mess.

You gotta just find a way
to earn that money back.

How? I can _
barely pay my own bills.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.828

a boring, shitty job

All right, just a pinch.

Yes. We're gonna take
yours and Ryn's to the lab.

Gonna test _
for any hormones or chemicals

07:20.460 --> 07:21.916
that might be causing
the infertility.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.707
Infertility.
This means no babies?

07:24.710 --> 07:26.610
There might be
an obvious cause.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.917
Hopefully we can
figure it out.

We'll also check

07:36.620 --> 07:38.827
but we want to keep him
away from the lab.

It's better if the military
doesn't know he's on land.

Yes. Safer.

All right, I'm gonna
take Levi to Helen's.

is covering up

08:15.620 --> 08:16.700
what happened with the rig.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.701
The military?

08:18.710 --> 08:20.575
Why-- Why would
they be involved?

08:20.580 --> 08:22.536
I don't know. I thought you
might have a theory.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.701
Itsounds
pretty far-fetched to me.

08:24.710 --> 08:26.780
The guy seems to know
what he's talking about, though.

08:26.790 --> 08:29.497

Maybe Ben and Ryn make baby.

That wouldn't help
your species, though.

during mating season.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.411
I glow.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.662
What are those?
Are they hormones, too?

13:00.790 --> 13:02.371
They're similar,

13:02.380 --> 13:03.779
but they're not an exact match.

13:03.790 --> 13:06.372
I never seen anything
like them before.

13:06.380 --> 13:07.608
I'll have them analyzed,

13:07.620 --> 13:11.659
but in the meantime,
I would like to do an MRI.

13:11.670 --> 13:16.448
Uh, he just wants to take
images. Like photos.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.779
It helps us see inside you.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.781
Like we did
for my brain and Ben's.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.451
Okay, yes. We look inside.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.497
-Hello?
-Rick, it's Helen.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.456
I'm sorry
to bother you at work.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.873
-Is everything okay?
-No, it's not.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.419
John Rooney, the older man
we met at the picnic?

13:44.580 --> 13:45.740
He's dead.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.491
What happened?
Was he sick?

13:49.500 --> 13:53.459
No. He died yesterday

13:53.460 --> 13:54.745
after suggesting to me

13:54.750 --> 13:56.741
that these people,
our relatives,

13:56.750 --> 13:58.490
may be very dangerous.

13:59.710 --> 14:00.825
Dangerous how?

14:02.580 --> 14:04.536
They may have
murdered my father.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.826
-Is that what he told you?
-Yes.

14:09.830 --> 14:12.708
And he thought that
somebody was watching him.

14:12.710 --> 14:15.577
Maybe they didn't like
that he was talking to me.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.616
So you think
they had him killed?

14:17.620 --> 14:19.918
Well, it seems like
more than a coincidence.

I'm Beth.

Beth.

14:39.750 --> 14:40.785
You.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.869
You...

14:45.500 --> 14:47.536
are like Helen.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.576
Yes.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.662
Helen and I are family.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.871
Like you and I.

14:57.670 --> 14:58.876
Family.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.748
Did you know there are
many others here on land?

15:03.750 --> 15:04.876
Like us?

15:05.880 --> 15:06.869
Others.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.495
Would you like to meet them?

15:11.540 --> 15:12.950
They are here?

15:12.960 --> 15:14.609
Not far.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.668
They would very much
like to meet you.

15:16.670 --> 15:20.538
Come. I can take you.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.951
I don't know, Helen.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.746
I think you're blowing this
out of proportion.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.570
They did abduct us.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.491
Let's not forget that.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.740
Out of desperation.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.820
Well maybe
this is desperation, too.

15:32.830 --> 15:36.948
My gut is telling me
something is not right.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.531
Well, Beth didn't
trust you, either.

15:39.540 --> 15:40.780
Not until I told her.

15:42.620 --> 15:43.609
Told her what?

15:43.620 --> 15:44.996
That they were here.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.570
VVho?

15:50.710 --> 15:51.916
The full-blooded ones.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.570
Oh, Rick.

15:56.710 --> 15:57.825
Oh, you--

15:57.830 --> 16:00.572
Oh, you shouldn't
have done that.

Helen? What's going on?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.325
You need to get over here!

16:12.330 --> 16:14.616
Your sister has taken Levi!

16:17.380 --> 16:19.450
This is me? Inside?

This is
your reproductive system.

in certain types of sharks.

So she's healthy?

16:34.750 --> 16:36.991
I see no damage,
no abnormalities.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.911
Thanks.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.911
This is great news, Ryn.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.571
Now I just need to analyze
those samples we brought back.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.571
Water from home.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.743
Yeah. If I work quickly,
we may have some answers
before you go back.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.819
Levi's gone.

16:50.830 --> 16:52.821
-Where?
-I don't know.

16:52.830 --> 16:53.819
He went with one
of those people

16:53.830 --> 16:55.661
Helen was telling me about.

16:55.670 --> 16:57.615
Didn't she think
they were dangerous?

16:58.920 --> 17:01.616
Look, you keep
working here.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.996
Ryn can come with me.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.820
Helen said there's
a couple of places
we can check.

You remember when, um,
it was Career Day

Sorry. It's been
an unusual day.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.826
Really? Because
I'm getting the feeling

25:33.830 --> 25:36.993
that abduction is par
for the course around here.

-No one's been abducted.
-Where's Levi?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.161
He's perfectly safe.

He's one of us, Helen.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.029
We wouldn't hurt him.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.109
And yet John is dead.

by prolonged exposure

26:12.920 --> 26:14.876
to the recording
of your friend's song.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.871
So you're torturing him?

26:17.880 --> 26:20.030
Quite the opposite.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.827
This is the song that
you recorded underwater.

26:22.830 --> 26:24.878
We're hoping
it'll reverse the damage.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.201
Obviously, we're still
in the early stages.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.200
You wanted to see me?

fertility tests on Ryn.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.075
That's right.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.787
We'd like to understand
her reproductive system.

Well, it's come
to my attention

26:45.000 --> 26:46.206
you have
a male blood sample as well.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.871
Where did you get that?

26:47.880 --> 26:49.871
We got it a while back,

26:49.880 --> 26:52.952
before the rest
of Ryn's people
went back in the water.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.825
Well, it's important work,

26:54.830 --> 26:56.957
given the rapid decline
in their population.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.878
Who told you
their population's in decline?

27:00.880 --> 27:03.166
There's nothing
that goes on in my lab
I don't know about.

27:04.170 --> 27:05.956
Uh, listen,

27:05.960 --> 27:10.112
I'd like to do
everything I can to help.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.873
We appreciate it.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.246
Well, the military has done
advanced work around the world

27:15.250 --> 27:16.990
with endangered species.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.036
We're using IVF technology

27:19.040 --> 27:21.031
to save the northern
white rhino in Africa,

27:21.040 --> 27:24.783
so who's to say
that we couldn't _
accomplish the same thing

27:24.790 --> 27:26.997
for your friends right here?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.912
You're talking about
creating mermaid embryos

27:29.920 --> 27:31.160
here in the lab?

27:31.170 --> 27:33.240
It's a possibility, yeah.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.822
If we had access to a male.

27:36.830 --> 27:39.071
[ominous music]

27:45.210 --> 27:46.916
There's Helen's car.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.070
She hasn't answered my texts.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.911
No, no, no. Ryn, wait.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.112
[Helen] John
told me how dangerous
your little group is.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.281
This is a community.

27:59.290 --> 28:01.167
Yes, we have a secret.

28:01.170 --> 28:04.071
And, yes,
they need protection
from the outside world.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.116
But they're
your secrets, too, Helen.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.111
You can understand that.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.908
And you'd go to any length
to preserve it.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.285
Our survival depends on it.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.167
But it doesn't mean
we killed John.

28:15.170 --> 28:17.115
My father was also killed.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.917
_ Or was that
just a c0inCIdence?

28:18.920 --> 28:20.205
That happened
before I was born.

28:20.210 --> 28:21.325
Oh, so you admit
he was killed?

28:21.330 --> 28:22.991
[Beth] I didn't say that.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.991
Just give her a chance
to explain.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.991
You know...

28:27.000 --> 28:29.241
You know, you can--
you can sit there in judgment.

28:29.250 --> 28:33.209
But can you imagine
what would happen
if we were found out?

28:33.210 --> 28:36.282
Seeing how "others"
are treated in this country?

28:36.290 --> 28:41.876
I can guarantee
we'd be victimized,
if not rounded up.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.952
You're fearmongering
to control these people.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.248
150 years ago,
Charles Pownall led a massacre.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.990
You can't be naive enough

28:50.000 --> 28:51.956
to think
it couldn't happen today.

28:51.960 --> 28:56.169
That family, the Pownalls,
they're all still around.

28:56.170 --> 28:58.912
You know this.
You live in Bristol Cove.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.285
[chuckling]

29:00.290 --> 29:01.370
What?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.114
We are Pownalls.

29:05.250 --> 29:06.956
The three of us.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.030
Descended from Charles.

29:10.170 --> 29:11.239
What?!

29:14.080 --> 29:18.164
Our-- Our great-
great-grandparents
fled from the massacre.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.240
They didn't lead it.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.912
It was on the DNA test
that led me to Rick.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.161
[sighs]
She never told me that.

29:25.170 --> 29:27.661
The three of us
are descended

29:27.670 --> 29:30.571
from the baby Charles
had with his mermaid.

29:31.750 --> 29:34.958
Why would our ancestors
hide the truth?

29:34.960 --> 29:35.949
Maybe they were scared.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.609
[knock on door]

29:37.620 --> 29:38.666
Sorry to interrupt.

29:38.670 --> 29:39.705
We're ready out here.

29:39.710 --> 29:40.870
Thank you.

29:44.790 --> 29:47.532
I am warning you.
Don't say a word.

29:47.540 --> 29:48.871
No one can know.

30:02.750 --> 30:03.956
[door opens]

30:09.000 --> 30:10.615
My God.

30:16.670 --> 30:17.659
You are okay?

30:17.670 --> 30:19.820
Yes. Okay.

30:19.830 --> 30:21.616
We go.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.996
We just need to find Helen.

30:25.830 --> 30:27.991
Meredith? Who's this?

30:29.580 --> 30:30.660
[gaSP]

30:32.750 --> 30:35.742
[dramatic music]

30:42.040 --> 30:44.998
[dramatic music]

30:47.460 --> 30:48.700
What is your name?

30:48.710 --> 30:49.825
I am Ryn.

30:49.830 --> 30:53.163
Ryn. I am Beth.

30:53.170 --> 30:54.819
I'm so glad you came.

30:54.830 --> 30:57.037
-Where's Helen?
-And who are you?

30:57.040 --> 30:58.951
This is Ben.
He's with me.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.951
Do we know you?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.609
I don't think so.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.030
Helen is here.
She's fine.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.826
We take Levi and go.

31:05.830 --> 31:08.822
No, no, please.
Don't go yet.

31:08.830 --> 31:10.661
We've waited so long.

31:10.670 --> 31:12.877
We weren't sure
if those like you

31:12.880 --> 31:14.609
would ever return to land.

31:16.830 --> 31:17.876
We're your...

31:19.750 --> 31:20.785
family.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.746
Family.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.820
We'd love it
if you could join us.

31:26.830 --> 31:28.878
Ben, you're invited, too.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.074
We have to go.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.822
Ryn and Levi
are going back to the water.

31:32.830 --> 31:34.616
Back? Oh, no, please.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.996
Please don't go.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.871
These are our people.

31:41.880 --> 31:42.915
We stay.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.993
[male singer] I'm gonna
come out swingin'

31:49.000 --> 31:52.709
- I ain't backin' down
-Xander McClure?

31:52.710 --> 31:53.916
I'm Ian Sutton.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.740
I know you?

31:55.750 --> 31:58.708
-Hey, Sutton.
-Hey.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.702
Uh, Xan, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.780
The, uh-- The reporter?

32:03.790 --> 32:05.667
Oh, yeah. Hey.

32:05.670 --> 32:07.661
Uh, what can we do for you?

32:07.670 --> 32:10.787
You two have
a minute to chat about
the Klesco Oil attack?

32:10.790 --> 32:12.951
-Uh...
-Sure.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.871
-Why not?
-Why not?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.074
I'm unstoppable

32:16.080 --> 32:17.786
Yeah, sure. Why not?

32:32.170 --> 32:35.788
[suspenseful music]

33:15.830 --> 33:17.070
[Ian] You know,
I spoke with a fisherman

33:17.080 --> 33:19.071
who remembers seeing you two
the night of the attack

33:19.080 --> 33:21.742
out on the water.

33:21.750 --> 33:22.785
Oh, yeah? Who?

33:22.790 --> 33:24.075
Anonymous source.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.741
They said your boat
was out there

33:25.750 --> 33:28.162
about three miles
from the Klesco drillship.

33:28.170 --> 33:31.037
Isn't that the same length
of fishing line

33:31.040 --> 33:32.746
you guys
purchased that day?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.069
-At, uh...
-[snaps]

33:34.080 --> 33:36.162
...Walker Fishing Supply.

33:36.170 --> 33:38.741
See, the thing
I can't tell in all this is

33:38.750 --> 33:40.911
how the North Star burned.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.115
Fuel line malfunction.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.997
What exactly are you saying?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.207
I know you two
had something to do with
what happened out there.

33:50.210 --> 33:52.781
Sounds to me like you got
nothing more than a theory.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.782
Look, I know something
bigger's happening here.

33:55.790 --> 33:57.030
Something with the military

33:57.040 --> 33:59.076
and whatever creature
you guys caught way back when.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.701
That's what
I'm really after.

34:01.710 --> 34:03.610
If you guys can give me
proof of these things,

34:03.620 --> 34:05.497
something better than
that crappy video
you showed me,

34:05.500 --> 34:07.741
I'll make that the story.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.786
I'll leave you and
your eco-terrorism out of it.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.785
Here's my card.

34:16.790 --> 34:18.746
I'm sure you two
wanna talk it over.

34:23.380 --> 34:28.613
[playing folk melody]

34:28.620 --> 34:32.499
Something very odd
is going on around here.

34:41.580 --> 34:45.869
We have two new family members
joining us tonight,

34:45.880 --> 34:48.610
and I don't just mean
Helen and Rick,

34:48.620 --> 34:50.827
who some of you
have already met.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.878
Our family
is blessed to be joined

34:52.880 --> 34:56.873
by two full-bloods.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.609
[excited murmurs]

35:04.460 --> 35:05.666
There's Helen.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.490
You think
these people are bad?

35:07.500 --> 35:09.456
I'm don't know
what they want from you.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.536
Ryn, Levi,

35:12.540 --> 35:14.451
would you come with me?

35:15.710 --> 35:19.453
[suspenseful music]

35:29.620 --> 35:31.781
Ryn insisted on staying.

35:31.790 --> 35:34.782
This place is getting
stranger by the minute.

35:34.790 --> 35:37.827
Everyone, this is Ryn

35:38.920 --> 35:40.535
and Levi.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.872
"'Why do you look
toward the sea,' they ask?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.911
The sistren who swam from you

35:51.920 --> 35:54.821
shall presently emerge.

35:54.830 --> 35:57.822
Our sistren who rise
shall be strong.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.783
Warriors of land and sea."

36:08.500 --> 36:13.494
Well, there
goes my future. Again.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.821
Eco-terrorism isn't gonna
look great on my rsum.

36:15.830 --> 36:17.661
You think he'd take a bribe?

36:17.670 --> 36:18.705
What are you gonna
bribe him with?

36:18.710 --> 36:20.666
Yeah, good point.

36:20.670 --> 36:22.490
But we gotta
give him something.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.570
Just to shut him up
till this thing dies down.

36:24.580 --> 36:25.660
Like what?

36:26.750 --> 36:27.876
Like her.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.706
No.

36:32.710 --> 36:34.826
No, we're not gonna
do that, man.

36:34.830 --> 36:36.878
We gotta think
of something else.

36:40.830 --> 36:44.539
[ominous music]

36:46.790 --> 36:49.577
[Helen] Ben,
it's happening again.

36:50.670 --> 36:51.659
[whispers] Go.

36:54.670 --> 36:55.785
[Helen laughs]

36:57.580 --> 36:59.821
[Ryn and Levi hissing]

37:09.710 --> 37:11.780
[both hissing]

37:12.380 --> 37:14.200
Not in here! Not in here.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.166
We gotta get you guys
back in the water.

37:22.170 --> 37:23.376
Now. Go.

37:23.380 --> 37:24.608
Yes, that would be--

37:28.380 --> 37:31.247
Yeah, I know why you
look so familiar.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.239
You're a Pownall.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.457
Uh, you must be mistaken.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.451
This man is a Pownall.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.451
He's a descendant
of Charles,

37:38.460 --> 37:39.449
who killed our kind.

37:39.460 --> 37:41.325
[shocked murmurs]

37:42.580 --> 37:45.287
I think now would be
a very good time

37:45.290 --> 37:47.531
for me to tell your friends

37:47.540 --> 37:50.373
that there's more
than one descendent
of Charles Pownall here.

37:50.380 --> 37:51.495
They'd never believe you.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.377
Why don't we find out?

37:53.380 --> 37:55.575
I'm a friend.
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.660
Our_ visitors
would like to leave.

38:03.330 --> 38:05.207
Back off.

38:05.210 --> 38:07.451
So you're just gonna
let them all go, huh?

38:07.460 --> 38:08.495
[Beth] Don't worry.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.372
We'll get them back.

38:21.210 --> 38:24.282
You don't tell me
before about your family.

38:24.290 --> 38:26.281
We talk about it,
and you say nothing.

38:26.290 --> 38:27.370
I was afraid.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.530
-Afraid?
-Of this.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.498
Of you thinking that
I am the same as Charles.

38:32.500 --> 38:35.572
Benisfnend.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.706
Yeah, I'm trying to be.

38:38.330 --> 38:40.662
In water, we kill
for food, protection.

38:42.380 --> 38:44.666
Ben's family kill
because they are angry.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.661
Murder.

38:46.670 --> 38:50.538
I'm ashamed that
I am related to someone
who could do that.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.496
Yes. Shame.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.240
I made a mistake.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.247
I should have told you.

38:59.250 --> 39:02.322
[phone buzzing]

39:04.290 --> 39:05.370
Hey, we got Levi.

39:05.380 --> 39:07.245
So he's okay?

39:07.250 --> 39:08.319
Yeah, he's fine.

39:09.670 --> 39:12.286
We're almost there.

39:12.290 --> 39:14.611
[male singer]
Watch and wait

39:14.620 --> 39:17.703
It's closer
every step you take

39:18.750 --> 39:21.321
You can't run

39:23.380 --> 39:26.531
You can't hide

39:27.750 --> 39:30.457
On and on and on

39:30.460 --> 39:32.280
The bell is ringing

39:32.290 --> 39:33.666
And they know you're here

39:33.670 --> 39:35.319
Ryn, you're beautiful.

39:37.290 --> 39:38.370
Time to go in the water.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.496
Make more.

39:44.330 --> 39:46.662
- On and on and on
-Ryn.

39:46.670 --> 39:48.376
The bell is ringing

39:48.380 --> 39:51.747
And they know you're here

39:51.750 --> 39:54.492
On and on and on

39:54.500 --> 39:56.320
The bell is ringing

39:56.330 --> 39:58.787
Oh, the time is near

39:58.790 --> 40:02.783
I see your halo fallin'

40:02.790 --> 40:06.749
Comin' unstable, darlin'

40:06.750 --> 40:08.741
Don't cry for mercy

40:08.750 --> 40:10.786
Nobody's comin'

40:10.790 --> 40:14.749
I see your halo fallin'

40:14.750 --> 40:18.572
I see your halo fallin'

40:18.580 --> 40:21.708
Comin' unstable, darlin'

40:30.380 --> 40:31.574
Let's get some rest.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.616
We might not wanna
go back to your place.

40:36.710 --> 40:38.666
What do you mean?

40:38.670 --> 40:40.786
There are cameras
in the houseboat.

40:42.420 --> 40:43.569
They've been watching us?

40:43.580 --> 40:45.411
Who knows how long.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.456
They were watching
this morning.

41:01.540 --> 41:03.826
Hey, man, if you're looking
to kill me, just say so.

41:03.830 --> 41:05.491
I'm not gonna
kill you, man.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.785
I just want
to show you something.

41:10.540 --> 41:12.496
What the hell?

41:12.500 --> 41:14.661
[Ian] What is this?

41:14.670 --> 41:15.705
A graveyard?

41:20.380 --> 41:21.824
[Xander]
Yeah, used to be.

41:23.710 --> 41:25.666
Looks like somebody
beat us to it.

41:25.670 --> 41:29.458
[dramatic music]

41:31.500 --> 41:33.536
[high-pitched call]

41:36.880 --> 41:40.498
[music playing]
