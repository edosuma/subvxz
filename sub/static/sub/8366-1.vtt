00:02.098 --> 00:03.664
Are you going to Pickathon?

00:03.666 --> 00:04.932
Definitely.

00:04.934 --> 00:07.001
Me and Anne might do
the whole weekend.

00:07.003 --> 00:08.602
That's a music festival,
right?

00:08.604 --> 00:10.171
It's like, uh,
camping and everything.

00:10.173 --> 00:11.505
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

00:11.507 --> 00:13.274
But there are hotels nearby,
so...

00:13.276 --> 00:15.142
Yeah, I haven't missed a year
since it started.

00:15.144 --> 00:16.343
Are you and Michelle
gonna go?

00:16.344 --> 00:18.212
- You guys should go.
- Oh...

00:18.214 --> 00:20.681
I mean, you know who's
headlining, right?

00:20.683 --> 00:22.316
together: Flaming Lips!

00:22.318 --> 00:23.384
That's great.

00:23.386 --> 00:25.686
Okay, that's exciting.

00:25.688 --> 00:28.022
I mean, we'd have to
get there early.

00:28.024 --> 00:29.990
Yeah, to see some of the
bands. And then kind of late

00:29.992 --> 00:33.227
to see some of the other ones.
It's like a full day.

00:33.229 --> 00:34.395
It's supposed to be
100 degrees.

00:34.397 --> 00:35.629

- So expensive.

00:38.367 --> 00:39.533
Yeah, but I don't
want to miss out,

00:39.535 --> 00:41.202
you know what
I'm saying, like--

00:41.204 --> 00:43.170
I know, and everyone's
gonna be talking about it,

00:43.172 --> 00:44.371
and we're gonna have to
watch everyone's

00:44.373 --> 00:45.706
Instagram photos
and Twitter...

00:45.708 --> 00:47.308
That's all porta-potties
right there.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.709
The smell situation,
the small talk situation.

00:48.711 --> 00:50.177
How many festivals
are we gonna go to?

00:50.179 --> 00:51.512
- This is never gonna end.
- That sounds terrible.

00:51.514 --> 00:53.247
It's uncivilized.

00:53.249 --> 00:55.049
- Let's not go, I-- I just--
- Let's just skip it.

00:55.051 --> 00:56.417
- I can't this year.
- Let's just forget it.

00:56.419 --> 00:58.252
Yeah.
Oh, well.

00:58.254 --> 01:00.254

01:02.525 --> 01:04.257

01:04.260 --> 01:07.094

actually not that fun.

- That's us.
- Yeah.

comfortably in your living room,

01:32.455 --> 01:33.888

01:33.890 --> 01:37.358
It was hard,

01:39.362 --> 01:42.029

to you.

01:48.371 --> 01:49.904

a better solution

horseback riding.

It's about the music first.

02:31.647 --> 02:33.314
Okay.

02:33.316 --> 02:35.015
Sort of like last year
it was about the horses first.

02:35.017 --> 02:36.584
Yeah, I mean, last year
you got crazy with the horses.

02:36.586 --> 02:37.651
I was horse crazy.

02:37.653 --> 02:39.086
- But this year...
both: - Boy crazy.

02:39.088 --> 02:40.354
- Boy crazy.
- Boy crazy!

02:40.356 --> 02:42.089
When should we change
into the outfits?

02:42.091 --> 02:43.324
I don't know; maybe let's go
to a rest stop,

02:43.326 --> 02:44.325
get some snacks, and change.

02:44.327 --> 02:45.459

06:58.705 --> 07:00.471
- Is it like this?
- [rubbery creak]

07:00.473 --> 07:02.573
Yeah, I'd go with
the second one, for sure.

07:02.575 --> 07:03.741
Oh, God.

07:03.743 --> 07:05.276
[sighs]
I feel boy crazy.

07:05.278 --> 07:06.377
Oh, my God, me too.

07:06.379 --> 07:08.246
But I'm really feeling it.

07:08.248 --> 07:09.647
Do you think I'm boy crazy?

07:09.649 --> 07:10.915
Yeah.
Do you think I'm boy crazy?

07:10.917 --> 07:12.216
I do.
I am. I am.

07:12.218 --> 07:14.285
- I am boy crazy.
- No, you are boy crazy.

07:14.287 --> 07:15.586
Do you think he's going
to the festival?

07:15.588 --> 07:16.988
We got to find out.

07:16.990 --> 07:18.456
This is the guy.

07:19.926 --> 07:21.492
[moans]

07:21.494 --> 07:23.427
[lion roar]

07:25.298 --> 07:26.898
Peanuts?

07:29.002 --> 07:30.334
- They're leaving.
- Where are they going?

07:30.336 --> 07:31.402
- We have to follow them.
- Okay.

07:33.261 --> 07:35.628
- Ahh!
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!

07:35.630 --> 07:37.296
- Whoa.
- This is inceredible. My body feels like

07:37.298 --> 07:38.798
it's floating!
So, we don't need to follow

07:38.800 --> 07:40.332
the highways. Let's just go
right there.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.600
Okay.

07:41.602 --> 07:44.003
<i>Go left. Up.
Up, up, up, up.</i>

07:44.005 --> 07:46.072
- Do your shoulders hurt?
- It's making me a little dizzy.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.573
I'm just gonna be honest.

07:47.575 --> 07:49.108
<i>- Oh, my God, look at this line.
- Oh, boy.</i>

07:49.110 --> 07:50.676
<i>All right,
well, I guess</i>

07:50.678 --> 07:52.311
<i>we'll just get
in the back of the--</i>

07:52.313 --> 07:53.979
Oh, no no, we don't have to!
We can go over!

07:53.981 --> 07:55.481
Right.
Ha-ha!

07:55.483 --> 07:57.650
It's called the future
and modernism.

07:57.652 --> 07:59.151
Hi, sorry.

07:59.153 --> 08:00.786
<i>We're wearing a
Flaming Lips shirt.</i>

08:00.788 --> 08:02.088
<i>I've got mine too.
Mine's black.</i>

08:02.090 --> 08:04.023
Number one fan
since the early days.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.158
<i>Hey, look at that!
There's a band.</i>

08:06.160 --> 08:07.827
They are just jammed in there.

08:07.829 --> 08:08.828
These people
are already waiting

08:08.830 --> 08:10.429
at the front of the stage.

08:10.431 --> 08:11.797
They're gonna have to
keep that spot all day

08:11.799 --> 08:13.165
- in order to see the band.
- [laughs]

08:13.167 --> 08:15.601
Yeah! We love you!
Get lost!

08:15.603 --> 08:17.703
- Oh no, what's going on?
- Ah, someone here got mad.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.338
Get out of here!

08:19.340 --> 08:21.273
- Come on, let's go this way.
- Okay.

08:21.275 --> 08:23.109
So it seems like our best bet
is that one band plays

08:23.111 --> 08:24.176
and then the other band plays.

08:24.178 --> 08:25.311
We can all agree on that?

08:26.848 --> 08:28.481
First of all,
it's important to remember

08:28.483 --> 08:30.816
we're all sitting on haystacks;
everyone is happy.

08:30.818 --> 08:32.784
They're willing
to have you go first.

08:32.787 --> 08:35.453
If you go first,
do you think you can pretend

08:35.456 --> 08:37.655
to be excited that Wayne
is coming on second?

08:39.626 --> 08:41.861
Great news, they said they'll go
first if you'll continually

08:41.863 --> 08:43.496
thank them during your set,

08:43.498 --> 08:44.997
and you got to trumpet them,
will you trumpet them?

08:44.999 --> 08:46.232
[bells jingle]

08:46.234 --> 08:47.566
They say you can perform
"Do You Realize"

08:47.568 --> 08:49.034
to your heart's content.

08:49.036 --> 08:50.503
You can't sing the chorus.

08:50.505 --> 08:52.471
I think he's
afraid of you, Sean.

08:52.473 --> 08:54.073
I think he knows you're good.
There's a positive in there.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.008
- Wayne thinks you're good.
- No.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.476
If you do anything from the
second album,

08:57.478 --> 08:59.845
- no full songs, only medleys.
- No.

08:59.847 --> 09:02.581
They said no-- uh-- want me to
go back on that?

09:02.583 --> 09:03.916
What if we kissed a third band
into the deal?

09:03.918 --> 09:05.584
That's a no.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.086
He's asking that you guys
open with "Louie Louie."

09:07.088 --> 09:08.587
No.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.755
Someone's got to
get up there to sing.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.490
Pass.

09:11.492 --> 09:12.925
I feel like I'm negotiating
with myself, guys.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.327
Are we going to try
to save this deal?

09:15.329 --> 09:17.429
[sighs]
Oh, Sean.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.165
Where is Top Bun?

09:19.167 --> 09:21.000
Okay, Laura, I don't see him,
actually.

09:21.002 --> 09:22.001
We'll find him!

09:22.003 --> 09:23.769
How could you lose him?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.271
- We didn't lose him.
- Look, do you want to go back

09:25.273 --> 09:26.739
- to the gas station and--
- Wait.

09:26.741 --> 09:27.740
- What?
- Look at that couple.

09:27.742 --> 09:29.041
- Where?
- Over there.

09:29.043 --> 09:30.743
Aw, that's so sweet.
Look at that.

09:30.745 --> 09:32.878
She doesn't seem to mind
his weird little pink arms.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.847
Yeah, that's the best
vantage point, it's like,

09:34.849 --> 09:37.216
being up on someone's shoulders,
you can see everything,

09:37.218 --> 09:39.418
but you're with the person
you love.

09:39.420 --> 09:40.586
So close to them.

09:40.588 --> 09:41.954
[sighs]

09:41.956 --> 09:44.590
I got to ride
on Top Bun's shoulders.

09:44.592 --> 09:46.192
[moans]

09:46.194 --> 09:47.560
Oh, my God,
that would be so cool.

09:47.562 --> 09:49.028
Remember that French guy
I dated?

09:49.030 --> 09:50.696
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
with the croissants.

09:50.698 --> 09:52.965
Wait.
There's Top Bun!

09:52.967 --> 09:55.434
- Oh, my gosh, he has a conga.
- [gasps]

09:55.436 --> 09:58.571
It's so dumb that it's cool.
It's sexy.

09:58.573 --> 10:00.272
Yeah, it's like he doesn't
even care about anything.

10:00.274 --> 10:02.141
It's making me boy crazy.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.709
We can't afford
to lose him again.

10:03.711 --> 10:06.078
Okay, I am behind you
every step of the way.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.314
And I will be behind him
every step of his way.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.316
- Go. Go, go, go, go!
- Go!

10:13.354 --> 10:15.307
We're gonna go?

10:16.040 --> 10:18.006
- Load schedule.
- [beeping]

10:18.008 --> 10:19.975
Coachella from last year, no.

10:19.977 --> 10:21.844
Load current schedule.

10:21.846 --> 10:23.378
Oh, wait. Okay.
What about Peaches?

10:23.380 --> 10:25.280
She's on in, like, 15.

10:25.282 --> 10:26.882
Let's go see Refused first,
then come back for Peaches.

10:26.884 --> 10:28.851
- Okay, okay.
- Isn't it this way?

10:28.853 --> 10:30.519
- Um, that's the wrong way.
- I'm gonna go up above everyone

10:30.521 --> 10:32.554
just for one second,
and then I'll see.

10:32.556 --> 10:35.057
- Okay.
- Wha-aah!

10:35.059 --> 10:39.294
Nice, easy.
Okay, so, it's just this way.

10:39.296 --> 10:41.530
<i>- Uh, we're gonna miss Peaches.
- Okay, okay.</i>

10:41.532 --> 10:44.299
<i>- Step on it.</i>
- All right, let's go.

10:44.301 --> 10:46.034
Faster.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.336
I'm gonna destroy that bun.

10:47.338 --> 10:48.704
Oh, yeah, I want that bun.

10:48.706 --> 10:50.639
Hot Bun.

10:50.641 --> 10:52.407
How boy crazy am I
right now?

10:52.409 --> 10:54.009
You seem
really boy crazy.

10:54.011 --> 10:56.478
I want to be on the bottom
of that top bun.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.013
- What's up, brother?
- [hands slap]

10:58.015 --> 10:59.081
This is our time
to make our move.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.382
[sighs]

11:00.384 --> 11:01.383
All right,
what do we want to do?

11:01.385 --> 11:02.718
I mean, I guess we just...

11:02.720 --> 11:04.520
What's the game plan?
Is it me or you?

11:04.522 --> 11:06.421
It's us! Look, we said we were
gonna have a killer weekend.

11:06.423 --> 11:07.556
Are we gonna do this,
or what?

11:07.858 --> 11:09.291
- Yeah!
- Yes, this is good.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.725
All right,
we got some speed here.

11:10.727 --> 11:11.960
These things go fast.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.229
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:14.231 --> 11:16.998
Okay, but if it comes down
to it, you're fine to watch us.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.967
- Fine. Yes.
- Okay, good.

11:25.008 --> 11:27.008
- Ah!
- Oh, no.

11:27.010 --> 11:28.310
Ohh...

11:28.312 --> 11:30.679
- He lost it.
- Oh, he needs it back.

11:30.681 --> 11:32.514
Yeah. We got to give it back
to him. Ugh.

11:32.516 --> 11:33.548
- Smell it, quick.
- I can't.

11:33.550 --> 11:34.816
The Flaming Lips!

11:34.818 --> 11:36.685
- We got to find him.
- Oh, no!

11:36.687 --> 11:37.886
- We have to get him?
- Oh no, where is he?

11:37.888 --> 11:39.187
- He's here.
- Recognize him?

11:39.189 --> 11:42.390
[indistinct yelling]

11:42.392 --> 11:45.260
You're not Top Bun!

11:45.262 --> 11:47.496
I think I hit somebody.

11:48.832 --> 11:50.265
Shit.

11:52.736 --> 11:54.603
Don't forget your
meal tickets.

11:54.605 --> 11:56.037
I think I made it worse.

11:56.039 --> 11:57.706
The Flaming Lips
won't be appearing.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.441
Why won't they
go on stage?

11:59.443 --> 12:01.376
We can't relitigate the
conversations I just had.

12:01.378 --> 12:03.411
It blew up, they're angry
at each other,

12:03.413 --> 12:05.013
it was partially my fault.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.348
When we sold passes
to this festival,

12:06.350 --> 12:08.116
we sold them with the idea

12:08.118 --> 12:10.185
that The Flaming Lips would be
headlining the second night.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.186
Do you guys have
any suggestions?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.054
Do you have a contract?

12:13.056 --> 12:14.723
No, I know there's a contract,
The Flaming Lips have never

12:14.725 --> 12:16.291
violated a contract,
I wrote the contract.

12:16.293 --> 12:17.926
We need to hear those songs,
otherwise, not only are we

12:17.928 --> 12:19.261
not gonna pay you,
we're gonna sue you.

12:19.263 --> 12:20.929
- [gulps]
- We have two Flaming Lip bands.

12:20.931 --> 12:22.264
- And then now we've got zero?
- Yes.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.632
How do we go
from two to zero?

12:23.634 --> 12:24.699
And soon
there's gonna be three,

12:24.701 --> 12:26.568
because Sean is dynamite.

12:26.570 --> 12:27.802
Get your band on stage.

12:27.804 --> 12:29.237
It's not working.

12:29.239 --> 12:30.739
All right, so you're
telling me to my face

12:30.741 --> 12:32.474
that there's gonna be no
Flaming Lips on stage?

12:32.476 --> 12:33.742
Just tell me right now.
Say that.

12:33.744 --> 12:35.310
Hey, David, I want you
to listen in--

12:35.312 --> 12:37.045
D-- No no, David
doesn't need to come down.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.446
Dave, you want to
come down here?

12:38.448 --> 12:39.915
No, I'm trying to
work this out, okay?

12:39.917 --> 12:41.383
The Flaming Lips are
supposed to perform live.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.817
David, he's saying--
[repeating John quietly]

12:42.819 --> 12:44.119
both: All the guys
had a big fight.

12:44.121 --> 12:45.754
both: What would
make David happy?

12:50.427 --> 12:52.794
What would make David happy is
what would make the crowd happy.

12:52.796 --> 12:54.763
We want some Flaming Lips
up there.

12:54.765 --> 12:57.599
For The Flaming Lips to
appear, it would have to be

12:57.601 --> 12:59.467
credibly, someone who is

12:59.469 --> 13:01.136
associated with
The Flaming Lips.

13:01.138 --> 13:03.104
We want to hear that music.
I don't care who sings it.

13:03.106 --> 13:04.806
Okay, The Flaming Lips are
getting on stage.

13:04.808 --> 13:06.308
- Great.
- Great.

13:06.310 --> 13:08.143
The Flaming Lips will be
appearing tonight.

13:08.145 --> 13:09.477
Well, that's what
I need to hear.

13:09.479 --> 13:10.512
Cool. That's all
we need to know.

13:10.514 --> 13:11.580
Come on.

13:18.855 --> 13:21.122
<i>All right, so
main stage is there,</i>

13:21.124 --> 13:22.791
I think Flaming Lips
are playing soon.

13:22.793 --> 13:24.593
<i>Brendan, there's a campsite
over this way,</i>

13:24.595 --> 13:26.528
- let's just cut through.
<i>- Okay, main stage bound?</i>

13:26.530 --> 13:28.029
<i>Let's go.</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:32.467
Oh, man, I love choppin' wood.

13:32.469 --> 13:33.969
This is gonna be so much fun,

13:33.971 --> 13:36.504
I can't wait to see
The Flaming Lips, yeah!

13:36.506 --> 13:38.039
<i>So they spend the whole
weekend here?</i>

13:38.041 --> 13:39.708
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:39.710 --> 13:41.509
<i>I... hate camping,
especially at a festival.</i>

13:41.511 --> 13:43.612
What the hell is that?

13:43.614 --> 13:45.146
Wow, this is cool.

13:45.148 --> 13:46.548
[loud smack, thud]

13:46.550 --> 13:48.283
- Whoa!
- Hey.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.651
See me knock that drone down?

13:49.653 --> 13:51.353
[scoffs]
Out of the sky.

13:51.355 --> 13:53.188
<i>- Sir, excuse me?</i>
- Holy crap, this thing speaks?

13:53.190 --> 13:54.823
What's your problem, man?
What, do you got a problem?

13:54.825 --> 13:56.124
You're just, like,
some sort of problem guy?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.325
<i>Huh, you a tough guy?</i>

13:57.327 --> 13:58.360
- Yeah, I'm a tough guy.
- Yeah.

13:58.362 --> 13:59.794
What are you, some sort of...

13:59.796 --> 14:01.730
nerd sitting at home
with your drone?

14:01.732 --> 14:03.999
- What's up, you want to fight?
- Brendan, I-- I don't know.

14:04.001 --> 14:05.567
