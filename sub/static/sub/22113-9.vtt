<i>You're shipping out with</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:03.390 --> 00:06.920
-Where's my breast milk?
-That was the <i> breast</i>
White Russian I've ever had.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.820
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:08.860 --> 00:10.660

00:12.430 --> 00:13.560
Huh. Hmm.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.930
We'll have to check that out.

00:14.960 --> 00:15.760
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:19.040 --> 00:20.400
Not to brag, but the doctor said

00:20.440 --> 00:22.700
it was the biggest boil
they had ever seen.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.940
Of course I hadn't seen it
'cause it was on my backside.

00:24.970 --> 00:29.210
But what came out of there
was crazy!

00:29.250 --> 00:34.180
It was so...
voluminous and viscous.

00:34.220 --> 00:37.620
Like sour cream
or-or curdled milk.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.250
Kind of...

00:39.290 --> 00:42.090
Here, put your finger
in this pad of butter.

00:42.130 --> 00:45.090
Oh, no, never mind.
Uh, it was way softer than this.

00:45.130 --> 00:47.700
But anyway,
when he applied pressure,

00:47.730 --> 00:50.600
it just started spindling out.

00:50.630 --> 00:53.230
And it kept coming
and coming and coming.

00:53.270 --> 00:57.110
I mean, the full load could have
fed a family of four.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.640
You look gorgeous.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.450
Thank you.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.780
Hi. If you have a minute,

01:05.820 --> 01:07.620
I'd like to tell you
about the specials.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.380
Oh, I already know
about one of them.

01:10.420 --> 01:14.160
'Cause she's sitting...
right across from me.

01:15.290 --> 01:16.620
Great.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.730
In addition,
we have a potato leek soup,

01:19.760 --> 01:21.560
and the fish of the day
is halibut.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.070
I'm actually just gonna get
the garden salad.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.500
What a coincidence.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.740
Two salads, please.

01:27.770 --> 01:30.270
And a soup to share?

01:30.310 --> 01:32.440
- Uh...
- A soup to share.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.740
One spoon.

01:34.780 --> 01:39.080
Thank you so much...

01:39.120 --> 01:40.750
Damien.

01:40.780 --> 01:44.590

but it's okay.

What?

01:56.900 --> 01:59.030
Have you ever been painted?

01:59.070 --> 02:00.770
You know, like, a painting?

02:00.800 --> 02:02.470
No.

02:02.510 --> 02:03.770
Then it's settled.

02:03.810 --> 02:05.710
We're going back
to my place after dinner,

02:05.740 --> 02:08.440
and I'm gonna paint you,
just like Jack did to Rose.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.880
Can we have the check, please?

02:09.910 --> 02:12.610
- I don't think so.
- I live right up the street.

02:12.650 --> 02:15.320
I could carry you.

02:15.350 --> 02:17.320
I'm so sorry.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.420
I better take this.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.160
Hello?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.530
Oh, no.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.500
I'll be right there.

02:27.530 --> 02:30.300
That was my friend
who's watching my dog.

02:30.330 --> 02:32.900
She said he's sick
and had to go to the hospital.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.500
Oh, no.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.470
I promise this isn't
one of those fake calls

02:36.510 --> 02:37.870
you ask your friends to make

02:37.910 --> 02:40.310
in case the date isn't
going well so you can leave.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.680
- My dog really is sick.
- Oh, of course.

02:42.710 --> 02:45.480
I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh, terrible.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.180
What's your dog's name?

03:44.170 --> 03:47.040
meat kind of housed
on the inside kind of thing.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.740
A little like the crown roast
you made for Christmas.

03:49.780 --> 03:51.780
Yes.

Um, do you think you could
help me change my tire?

05:30.010 --> 05:31.710
I must have driven over

05:31.750 --> 05:35.220
a Mike's Hard Lemonade bottle
or something.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.720
Okay, so, the spare's in here.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.050
- And you mind helping me
pull it out? -Oh, sure.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.490
- I have a cold.
- No problem.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.590
- Let me move this axe out of
the way. -Oh, okay. Thank you.

05:42.630 --> 05:44.330
- Move that.
- All right.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.930
So, uh, how's your week going?

05:45.960 --> 05:48.100
Oh, it's been pretty good.
I-I had this...

05:58.310 --> 05:59.670
Hi, Mom.

05:59.710 --> 06:02.340
You might be hearing
some things about me.

06:02.380 --> 06:06.510
I just want to say
that I am so sorry.

06:06.550 --> 06:09.920
I just... I just want you
to know that...

06:09.950 --> 06:11.950
you-you are in no way to blame.

06:11.990 --> 06:13.350
This is not your fault.

06:13.390 --> 06:17.360
If anything, I would blame Dad.

06:17.390 --> 06:20.860
Anyway, uh... I love you.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.860
Bye.

06:37.150 --> 06:40.180
Do you take American dollars?

06:41.580 --> 06:42.550
America?

06:44.190 --> 06:45.150
Yee-haw!

06:45.190 --> 06:46.890
Dollars.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.390
For that one. I'll give you
dollars for that. You know what?

06:49.430 --> 06:50.720
That one and that one.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.890
And the little ones down...

06:52.930 --> 06:56.760
You know what? All of 'em.
How much for all of them?

07:04.670 --> 07:06.640
You're doing great.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.780
You know, I don't say this to
all my models, but I'm getting

07:08.810 --> 07:12.310
some real <i> Whistler's Mother</i>
vibes from you.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.380
I like your painting.

07:15.780 --> 07:17.950
Oh, that?

07:17.990 --> 07:20.590
Aren't you sweet.

07:20.620 --> 07:24.160
That was during my bear period
a few years ago.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.030
I love pushing the form.

07:26.060 --> 07:29.600
You see, bears don't surf.

07:29.630 --> 07:32.870
But art doesn't care about that.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.270
Hmm.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.870
Oh. Can I see?

07:35.910 --> 07:38.010
No. Uh-uh.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.480
No. I don't like to show my work
until it's done.

07:41.510 --> 07:44.280
But soon.

07:44.310 --> 07:47.280
It's going really, really well.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.150
Like, exceedingly well.

07:51.190 --> 07:53.990
Just about done with your face.

07:54.020 --> 07:55.990
It's really
just the boobies left.

07:56.030 --> 07:58.790
All right, I'm gonna pop
into the other room.

07:58.830 --> 08:01.000
I'm gonna get
a more appropriate brush.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.200
Don't move.
I'm gonna be right back.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.700
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.670
So...

08:09.710 --> 08:12.370
did you tell anyone you're
having your portrait painted?

08:12.410 --> 08:14.210
No, it's a surprise
for my friends.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.710
Aw, that's great.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.150
Yeah, my friends always say,
"Paco, you work too hard."

08:18.180 --> 08:20.080
Uh, "You never do anything fun."

08:20.120 --> 08:23.020
So, when they see the painting,
I will show them.

08:23.050 --> 08:24.520
That's for sure.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.190
Love that story.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.720
Sorry it's taking me so long.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.230
Just searching
for the perfect brush.

08:35.429 --> 08:39.370
You know, I once painted
Jason Mraz.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.770
Course, it was all from memory.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.770
Found it.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.980
Perfect brush.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.880
The thing about acrylic paints
is that...

09:01.290 --> 09:03.690
Damn. Damn it!

09:12.130 --> 09:14.570
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.620
Ah, you have to stop this.

09:28.650 --> 09:29.920
Stop it!

09:29.950 --> 09:32.220
Stop it, stop it, stop!

09:32.250 --> 09:34.050
Stop! You have to stop!

09:34.090 --> 09:35.590
Stop it!

09:53.680 --> 09:56.640
He went that way!
He went that way over there!

09:56.680 --> 09:58.910
- Hands on your head!
- Okay, but this is on you.

09:58.950 --> 10:00.450
He's getting further
and further away.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.420
<i>- Capitán.</i>
- Uh...

10:02.450 --> 10:03.920
How...

10:03.950 --> 10:05.420
What?!

10:05.450 --> 10:06.950
I'm as surprised as you.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.820
Karl Cowperthwaite,
you are under arrest

10:09.860 --> 10:11.530
for the murder and desecration
of a body.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.460
Uh, careful,
I have an active boil.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.760
I have, uh,
prescription underwear.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.030
Top drawer, underneath
the knives.

10:16.070 --> 10:17.670
- All clear.
- Come on.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.130
- Let's go! <i>Vamos muchachos!</i>
- But he's getting away!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.270
When I call your number,

10:25.310 --> 10:28.040
repeat the phrase
you've been given.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.440
Number one.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.940
I get real...

10:30.980 --> 10:33.780
<i>Whistler's Mother</i> vibe from you.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.480
Number two.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.120
I getting real
whisker mother vibes...

10:38.150 --> 10:39.620
for-for you.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.290
Number three?

10:41.320 --> 10:45.360
I getting real whistles,
mothers, vibes from you.

10:45.390 --> 10:46.790
And number four.

10:49.670 --> 10:51.000
Some water.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.670
That's him.

11:07.350 --> 11:08.580
How's it coming?

11:08.620 --> 11:11.190
Oh, my finest work yet.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.390
It's like Matisse
mixed with Shakespeare

11:13.420 --> 11:15.820
and just a little Rhea Perlman
on top.

11:15.860 --> 11:18.730
Do you mind
turning around, Javi?

11:18.760 --> 11:20.660
I just want to paint
the rest of that tattoo

11:20.700 --> 11:21.860
that wraps around your back.

11:23.870 --> 11:26.370
What is that, a cobra with legs?

11:26.400 --> 11:28.270
Yes.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.270
Props.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.550
Hold very still.

11:57.570 --> 12:00.600
I swear it wasn't me.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.600
I swear.

12:06.610 --> 12:08.410
Psst. Hey.

12:10.150 --> 12:12.250
Hey, have you ever been painted?

12:14.280 --> 12:17.950
Mmm. Wow, yes,
I do eat out of boredom.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.390
Oh, hey, excuse me, Martinez?

12:20.420 --> 12:22.060
Why are you guys
wearing those masks?

12:22.090 --> 12:24.390
Just a precaution.
There's something going around.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.760
Hey, how's Javi doing?

12:25.790 --> 12:29.230
- He died.
- He died?

12:29.260 --> 12:31.970
Hey, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.170
- Right.
- No, I'm serious.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.640
I mean it.

12:35.670 --> 12:37.640
You know, people can change.

12:37.670 --> 12:39.240
I'll show you.

12:39.270 --> 12:41.340
Put your arm
right through there.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.840
No way.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.580
Well, if you did,
I wouldn't eat it.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.080
I wouldn't.

12:49.890 --> 12:52.620
I'm really changing.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.640
Time's up.

13:17.850 --> 13:20.980
Let's get you back to your cell.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.970
It's kind of lonely in here.

13:46.010 --> 13:49.010
If you ever want to talk,
you know where to find me.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.010
So...

14:22.040 --> 14:25.610
Karl Cowperthwaite.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.510
What kind of name is that?

14:27.550 --> 14:31.350
<i>All my hair
completely singed off.</i>

14:31.390 --> 14:33.550
- No.
- I'm standing there, buck naked,

14:33.590 --> 14:36.060
- No! -when the mayor
walks in.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.590
That's rich.

14:37.630 --> 14:39.430
That is funny.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.930
Ah. All right, my turn.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.130
- My turn, okay?
- Okay.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.200
Um, I have webbed toes.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.300
I love The Beatles.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.270
I can't roll my tongue.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.540
Loving the Beatles is the lie.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.040
Right.
I just can't get into them.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.050
Too many descending arpeggios.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.550
Ah.

15:00.580 --> 15:03.880
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.890
Why are you still here?

15:05.920 --> 15:09.120
I'm a prison guard.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.730
But it's just
the two of us left.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.800
Why don't you just...
get out of here?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.670
My family's dead.

15:21.700 --> 15:25.940
My friends... are dead.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.910
Well...

15:31.950 --> 15:34.150
we should get you back
to the cell, no?

15:34.180 --> 15:36.650
Ooh! Can we take the long way?

15:36.690 --> 15:38.920
Please?

15:38.950 --> 15:40.990
- Why not?
- Yeah!

15:41.020 --> 15:42.490
All right.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.740
I have some exciting news.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.310
I literally can't wait
to hear it.

16:02.340 --> 16:05.780
Today... is my last day.

16:05.810 --> 16:09.280
I hear people are alive
in Tapachula.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.820
I'm gonna find out
if it is true.

16:11.850 --> 16:13.950
That's great.

16:13.990 --> 16:15.790
I'm so happy.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.790
You take care.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.290
Wait, wait.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.800
Aren't you gonna let me out?

16:23.830 --> 16:27.630
Karl, you're a serial killer.

16:27.670 --> 16:29.540
I've changed.
I swear I've changed.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.540
Please, you got to let me out.

16:31.570 --> 16:34.040
Please, Martinez.
Please, please, don't do this.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.980
There is enough food here
for about two months.

16:37.010 --> 16:39.310
Then it is in God's hands.

16:39.350 --> 16:43.350
And if you prefer to take things
into your own hands...

16:52.190 --> 16:53.790
M-Martinez.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.540
Best of luck.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.680
I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you just trust me?

17:12.710 --> 17:14.510
I told you
I'm not a killer anymore.

17:14.550 --> 17:17.119
But you left me no choice,
so I had to kill you.

17:17.150 --> 17:18.920
In general,
I don't kill anymore.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.260
You got to believe me.
I don't kill anymore.

17:32.770 --> 17:34.530
Damn it. No!

17:34.570 --> 17:35.770
No!

17:35.800 --> 17:38.070
<i>No!</i>

17:42.640 --> 17:45.310
You got this, Karl.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.480
Hi, my old friend.

19:30.520 --> 19:35.020
You deserved better
than getting murdered.

19:35.060 --> 19:38.190
I know it's no excuse,
but I thought that,

19:38.230 --> 19:40.530
by killing you,
I could get out into the world

19:40.560 --> 19:44.360
and prove that I didn't
have to kill anymore.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.700
And that kind of backfired.

19:46.740 --> 19:49.700
Just know that...

19:49.740 --> 19:52.540
I truly had changed.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.680
Well, uh, I should go.

Getting out today.
