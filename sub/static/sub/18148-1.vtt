00:54.009 --> 00:56.176
- Please don't kill me.

00:56.178 --> 00:58.846
I'll do anything that you want.

01:00.548 --> 01:02.550
Do you want to kiss me?

01:04.053 --> 01:05.954
Is that what you want?

01:07.122 --> 01:10.091
You want me to take
my clothes off?

01:11.427 --> 01:12.527
You...

01:13.596 --> 01:15.530
You want to touch me?

01:15.532 --> 01:17.198
You can touch me.

01:19.369 --> 01:21.637
Is that what you like?

01:21.639 --> 01:24.073
You want to see more?

01:38.122 --> 01:39.155
- What's the matter?

01:39.157 --> 01:40.810
- I'm sorry, I just...

01:41.010 --> 01:42.664
I wasn't sure if...

01:42.864 --> 01:45.662
Adele told you there
was gonna be nudity, right?

01:45.664 --> 01:47.664
Yeah, we want to
make real sure that signal

01:47.666 --> 01:49.466
doesn't get crossed.

01:49.468 --> 01:51.348
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

01:51.621 --> 01:52.893
I just, I wasn't sure if...

01:53.093 --> 01:55.006
oh, she's wondering
if we needed her to...

01:55.008 --> 01:56.307
oh, you
mean like right now?

01:56.309 --> 01:57.308
- Yeah, no.

01:57.310 --> 01:58.309
That's not necessary.

01:58.311 --> 01:59.577
- Okay.

01:59.579 --> 02:01.245
Yeah, we can see
how beautiful you are.

02:01.247 --> 02:02.980
- No, look, it's...

02:02.982 --> 02:05.049
We appreciate your determination,
but she did tell you

02:05.051 --> 02:09.655
that the nudity is fairly
extensive though, Adele, right?

02:09.657 --> 02:13.191
Um, she just said
that there was nudity.

02:13.193 --> 02:14.626
- Nah, it's extensive.

02:14.628 --> 02:16.261
- You're okay with that?

02:16.263 --> 02:17.187
Is that?

02:17.357 --> 02:18.090
'Cause if it's not cool.

02:18.290 --> 02:20.098
What we're
saying is we need someone

02:20.100 --> 02:21.266
who's not gonna...

02:21.268 --> 02:23.269
yeah, we
cannot show up on set,

02:23.271 --> 02:25.538
and have the girl just change
her mind at the last minute,

02:25.540 --> 02:26.539
you know?

02:26.541 --> 02:28.074
- Yeah, no.

02:28.076 --> 02:29.642
Adele explained it to me.

02:29.644 --> 02:31.511
Okay, but
sometimes, even then,

02:31.513 --> 02:34.347
the agent and manager
explain it, and then,

02:34.349 --> 02:36.316
you gotta tell us now,
because this film,

02:36.318 --> 02:38.686
the way we're gonna shoot's
gonna be very verite.

02:38.688 --> 02:40.521
A lot of long takes.

02:40.523 --> 02:42.690
It would, it has to be you.

02:42.692 --> 02:44.158
It can't be a double.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.359
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

02:45.361 --> 02:48.529
We'll make sure
you look beautiful.

02:48.531 --> 02:51.565
- Uh, yeah, no, that's fine.

02:51.567 --> 02:52.633
That's fine.

02:53.636 --> 02:54.736
Um,

02:56.339 --> 02:57.339
should I?

02:57.341 --> 02:59.708
- Yes, please.

02:59.710 --> 03:00.542
- Can we go back?

03:00.544 --> 03:02.010
- Sure.

03:02.012 --> 03:04.112
Where are we going
back to, honey?

03:04.114 --> 03:05.013
- Oh, um.

03:07.616 --> 03:09.552
How about, "I'll do
anything you want?"

03:09.554 --> 03:10.686
Is that okay?

03:10.688 --> 03:12.021
Yeah,
whatever, sweetheart.

03:12.023 --> 03:13.689
It's all about you.

03:23.601 --> 03:25.502
- You want to kiss me?

03:27.105 --> 03:28.605
Is that what you want?

03:28.607 --> 03:30.040
You think I'm
gonna fall for that?

03:30.709 --> 03:33.176
I don't know, I don't know what
you want from me.

03:33.178 --> 03:35.712
I'll take my clothes off.

03:35.714 --> 03:36.780
You want to touch me?

03:36.782 --> 03:38.648
You can touch me.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.584
Yeah, you like that?

03:41.620 --> 03:43.521
You want to see more?

03:43.523 --> 03:45.023
You can see more.

03:46.058 --> 03:47.759
Is that what you want?

03:49.161 --> 03:52.163
You want me to take
my clothes off?

03:56.102 --> 03:58.170
You want to touch me?

03:58.172 --> 03:59.638
You can touch me.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.809
Is that what you want?

04:36.279 --> 04:38.579
It's just a couple of days.

04:39.748 --> 04:42.149
- It's three nights.

04:42.151 --> 04:42.850
Four days.

04:49.759 --> 04:52.394
Movie you auditioned for today,

04:53.596 --> 04:55.764
where does it shoot?

04:55.766 --> 04:57.833
- Um, in Colombia.

04:57.835 --> 04:58.834
- The country?

04:58.836 --> 05:01.437
- No, the city, in Missouri.

05:05.142 --> 05:07.143
- Is it a slasher film?

05:08.712 --> 05:11.514
They're, what, meth addicts?

05:11.516 --> 05:13.783
Zombie meth addicts on icicles?

05:15.453 --> 05:17.554
Please tell me you're
not running around naked,

05:17.556 --> 05:19.389
screaming and crying.

05:20.258 --> 05:23.327
You're hiding your body from me?

05:23.329 --> 05:24.228
Beth.

05:25.764 --> 05:29.399
You know, there's a
hundred art films.

05:29.401 --> 05:31.735
If you want mine, i
can download right now,

05:31.737 --> 05:33.671
where you had your
fucking clothes off.

05:33.673 --> 05:35.507
You know that, right?

05:37.243 --> 05:38.476
What about it?

05:38.478 --> 05:41.613
Are you getting
naked again, or what?

05:42.648 --> 05:43.681
- I don't know.

05:43.683 --> 05:46.351
I didn't read the whole script.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.902
You want me to cancel my trip?

06:02.904 --> 06:03.802
- No.

06:04.772 --> 06:05.872
I'm sorry.

06:06.674 --> 06:07.641
I'm a jerk.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.582
- I just feel like a bad friend.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.951
- Hey, stop talking like that.

06:19.220 --> 06:20.855
You're a good friend.

06:24.426 --> 06:28.362
The two of you will go
away, have a nice time.

06:28.364 --> 06:29.897
It'll be good for you.

06:29.899 --> 06:30.798
What?

06:32.668 --> 06:34.202
I like Anna.

06:34.204 --> 06:35.203
- No you don't.

06:35.205 --> 06:36.238
- I do.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.407
- You think she's a bully.

06:38.409 --> 06:40.676
- She's a little intense.

06:40.678 --> 06:41.977
Just, the whole career
obsession thing.

06:41.979 --> 06:43.845
I just don't know if it's
such a great influence

06:43.847 --> 06:46.682
for you to be
around, that's all.

06:46.684 --> 06:47.983
But I like Anna.

06:47.985 --> 06:49.924
- You're a terrible liar.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.255
You are.

06:52.623 --> 06:54.724
Maybe that's why I trust you.

06:54.726 --> 06:55.792
- You trust me?

06:55.794 --> 06:57.393
- Mm-hmm.

06:57.395 --> 06:59.696
- Big mistake. Big mistake.

07:05.469 --> 07:06.502
Hey.

07:06.504 --> 07:07.403
- Hmm?

07:08.607 --> 07:11.976
Sorry for the way i
talked to you before.

07:13.712 --> 07:15.012
It wasn't nice.

07:16.948 --> 07:21.252
Wish it didn't bother
me so much, but it does.

07:22.587 --> 07:23.487
I'm sorry.

07:28.327 --> 07:31.663
I mean, do you think that
i like to take my clothes off

07:31.665 --> 07:36.434
in a room full of hot
lights and total strangers?

07:36.436 --> 07:39.037
If you don't,
why do you do it?

07:42.342 --> 07:43.576
- What's this?

07:45.445 --> 07:46.979
The guy who gave me the
estimate said my spark plugs

07:46.981 --> 07:48.351
were misfiring or something?

07:48.561 --> 07:49.178
- Right.

07:49.378 --> 07:51.884
Well, also, there was a problem
with your oxygen sensor,

07:51.886 --> 07:53.519
but, don't worry, we took
care of that for you.

07:53.521 --> 07:54.754
- Oh, you did.

07:54.756 --> 07:57.491
Okay, what are you
doing right now?

07:59.294 --> 08:00.294
- Ma'am?

08:00.296 --> 08:01.928
- Are you lying to me?

08:01.930 --> 08:03.797
Because the guy who
gave me the estimate

08:03.799 --> 08:05.966
didn't say anything
about any oxygen sensor.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.368
He said my spark
plugs were misfiring.

08:08.370 --> 08:09.536
- Well, ma'am.

08:09.538 --> 08:10.971
I apologize if that's
the case, but...

08:10.973 --> 08:12.373
- what?

08:12.375 --> 08:13.908
What do you mean, if?

08:13.910 --> 08:16.044
I assure you that's the case.

08:16.046 --> 08:18.379
Well, I apologize
for the confusion, but...

08:18.381 --> 08:19.881
- there is no confusion.

08:19.883 --> 08:22.450
The guy who gave me the
estimate didn't say anything

08:22.452 --> 08:26.421
about any, what,
fucking oxygen sensor.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.923
Well, ma'am,
the fact of the matter

08:27.925 --> 08:31.794
is that oxygen sensor has
malfunctioned fairly frequently.

08:31.796 --> 08:33.996
- Oh, I bet they do.

08:33.998 --> 08:36.398
I take pride in
running an honest business,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.868
so I apologize if some
mistake was made here...

08:39.870 --> 08:42.938
- okay, now you keep saying if.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.541
A mistake was made.

08:44.543 --> 08:46.476
A mistake was definitely made.

08:46.478 --> 08:48.878
Ma'am, there's no
need to raise your voice here.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.113
- No?

08:50.115 --> 08:52.515
I show up here expecting
to pay for one repair,

08:52.517 --> 08:54.918
and there's an extra charge
for 300 fucking dollars

08:54.920 --> 08:57.754
slipped in that I know
absolutely nothing about?

08:57.756 --> 09:00.124
Okay, there is no need
for that kind of language,

09:00.126 --> 09:01.826
ma'am.

09:01.828 --> 09:05.963
Okay, well $300 is a lot
of fucking money to me,

09:05.965 --> 09:08.699
so you'll excuse me if i
don't appreciate the fact

09:08.701 --> 09:11.135
that you're trying to
fucking steal it from me.

09:11.137 --> 09:12.970
- I'm doing no such thing.

09:12.972 --> 09:15.106
Oxygen sensors
fail all the time.

09:15.108 --> 09:16.975
If you've got a broken one
and you don't repair it,

09:16.977 --> 09:19.010
your car's gas mileage is
gonna drop, and over time,

09:19.012 --> 09:20.946
it's gonna cost you a lot more.

09:20.948 --> 09:22.647
- No, no, no.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.516
That's not the point.

09:24.518 --> 09:27.586
The point is it wasn't
in the estimate.

09:27.588 --> 09:29.821
Even if you're telling the
truth, I didn't approve

09:29.823 --> 09:30.922
of the repair.

09:30.924 --> 09:32.859
That's all that matters.

09:32.861 --> 09:35.128
Well, ma'am, normally
i would give the customer

09:35.130 --> 09:36.963
the benefit of the
doubt, but the fact is,

09:36.965 --> 09:40.032
I really don't
like your attitude.

09:40.034 --> 09:41.067
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:41.069 --> 09:42.568
You don't like my attitude?

09:42.570 --> 09:43.803
- That's right.

09:43.805 --> 09:46.072
I mean, if you were a
touch more ladylike.

09:46.074 --> 09:48.642
- Are you fucking kidding me?

09:48.644 --> 09:51.979
This is your fucking
problem, not mine.

09:52.814 --> 09:53.847
- I wasn't there.

09:53.849 --> 09:55.115
I don't know who said what.

09:55.117 --> 09:56.417
Oh, you're just
absolving yourself

09:56.419 --> 09:58.066
of any responsibility now?

09:58.975 --> 09:59.253
Fine.

09:59.453 --> 10:01.088
You know what, I'm not
gonna stand here and argue

10:01.090 --> 10:03.825
with a fucking criminal.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.727
I'll pay for the spark plugs,
but I'm disputing the rest

10:05.729 --> 10:07.061
of the charges.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.471
- Houses, apartments, condos.

10:16.473 --> 10:19.175
Offices...
- Paul?

10:19.177 --> 10:20.009
Whoa.

10:20.011 --> 10:20.876
- Hi.

10:20.878 --> 10:21.911
- Hi, how's it going?

10:21.913 --> 10:22.912
- Good, how are you?

10:22.914 --> 10:25.047
- You're not behind the counter.

10:25.049 --> 10:25.981
Not used to that.

10:25.983 --> 10:27.183
- It's my day off.

10:27.185 --> 10:28.017
- Yeah, uh-huh.

10:28.019 --> 10:29.084
- Where you going?

10:29.086 --> 10:30.085
- Uh, camping.

10:30.087 --> 10:30.920
- Yeah?

10:30.922 --> 10:31.754
- Mm-hmm
- cool.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.588
- Where about?

10:32.590 --> 10:33.789
- Big sur.

10:33.791 --> 10:35.025
- Big sur.
- Yeah.

10:35.027 --> 10:36.092
- That's where this one's going.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.728
Anna's aunt's got
a house up there.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.197
Little old girls getaway.

10:40.199 --> 10:41.164
- Like now?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.166
- Yeah, just, for the weekend.

10:43.168 --> 10:44.163
- Weird.

10:44.950 --> 10:45.458
No, no.

10:45.658 --> 10:49.773
It's funny, 'cause I was
just thinking about you

10:49.775 --> 10:51.075
the other day, you know.

10:51.077 --> 10:52.610
I'm doing this short,
and I was thinking

10:52.612 --> 10:53.845
of using Anna.

10:53.847 --> 10:58.082
Yeah, I would just call
her, but there's no money,

10:58.084 --> 10:59.984
so I didn't wanna
like offend her.

10:59.986 --> 11:02.753
Do you think she'd
be offended if?

11:02.755 --> 11:04.522
Do you think she'd
do it for free?

11:04.524 --> 11:06.224
No, no, she'd probably,
she'd probably do it.

11:06.226 --> 11:08.827
Yeah, she usually does whatever.

11:08.829 --> 11:10.028
- Okay.

11:12.699 --> 11:13.832
- Okay.

11:13.834 --> 11:14.933
- Yeah.
- Cool.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.068
- Maybe I'll see you up there?

11:16.070 --> 11:17.135
- Yeah.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.570
- Cool.

11:23.244 --> 11:24.244
- You okay?

11:24.246 --> 11:26.246
- Yeah, fine. I'm fine.

11:34.623 --> 11:35.755
- She's here!

11:45.100 --> 11:46.267
All right.

11:46.269 --> 11:47.268
Got everything?

11:47.270 --> 11:48.302
- Yeah.

11:48.304 --> 11:49.303
- I'll get that.

11:49.305 --> 11:51.171
- Thank you.

11:55.645 --> 11:57.212
Well, okay, but you're
not listening to me.

11:57.214 --> 11:59.147
I don't have the fucking money.

11:59.149 --> 12:00.649
A
hardship letter could result

12:00.651 --> 12:01.287
in lower late fees.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.489
No, I don't want
lower late fees!

12:03.689 --> 12:06.321
I want no late fees, because
this isn't my fucking fault.

12:06.410 --> 12:07.303
It's your fault.

12:07.503 --> 12:08.590
Then we're gonna have

12:08.592 --> 12:09.324
to freeze your card.

12:09.326 --> 12:10.960
- Well, fuck you.

12:20.671 --> 12:23.272
- Um, do you want me to drive?

12:23.274 --> 12:24.674
- No, it's fine.

12:29.714 --> 12:30.914
- I'm really sorry about that.

12:30.916 --> 12:31.982
- It's fine.

12:34.052 --> 12:35.752
- Are you okay?

12:35.754 --> 12:38.155
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm fine.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.362
You look tired.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.968
- Uh, yeah, I guess, maybe.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.272
I guess you've been
really busy, right?

12:55.274 --> 12:56.608
- Not really.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.282
- Okay, ready?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.768
Is your boss
still harassing you?

13:21.770 --> 13:22.561
- Of course.

13:22.870 --> 13:23.292
I'm his favorite.

13:23.711 --> 13:25.271
He told me he had a dream
when he came on my tits

13:25.273 --> 13:26.906
the other day, so.

13:26.908 --> 13:30.244
Oh my god,
you have to quit.

13:35.717 --> 13:37.351
- The money's just not as good,

13:37.353 --> 13:41.822
and I can't afford
to take

14:02.714 --> 14:06.282
tuxedo park, that like
rich place, the mansion.

14:06.284 --> 14:08.151
- I forgot about tuxedo park.

14:08.153 --> 14:08.655
- Yeah.

14:08.856 --> 14:09.563
- Was that where it was?

14:09.763 --> 14:11.821
Yes, don't you remember
we like thought we

14:11.823 --> 14:13.890
were gonna go to this
horrible slum thing,

14:13.892 --> 14:15.291
and it ended up being this
mansion, and we didn't...

14:15.293 --> 14:16.993
- tuxedo park.

14:16.995 --> 14:18.328
Yes, and everybody was
actually wearing a tuxedo

14:18.330 --> 14:19.363
in tuxedo park.

14:19.365 --> 14:21.832
And we had like
jeans, and nothing else.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.033
- Yes, yes, yes.

14:23.035 --> 14:24.001
- Him. Him.

14:25.336 --> 14:26.403
- He liked me.

14:26.405 --> 14:27.438
- Yeah, he did.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.839
He totally did.

14:28.841 --> 14:31.375
Oh my god, when
did he tell you that?

14:31.377 --> 14:34.012
I think when I was
working at union pool.

14:34.014 --> 14:34.979
- Wait a second.

14:34.981 --> 14:36.481
When did you work at union pool?

14:36.483 --> 14:39.711
That time that I was
guest DJing with that boy

14:39.944 --> 14:40.299
that I liked.

14:40.499 --> 14:42.087
Who was the
boy that you liked?

14:42.089 --> 14:43.321
- That guy, Steven.

14:43.323 --> 14:45.223
Oh, god, he was
such an asshole.

14:45.225 --> 14:47.025
- No, he wasn't that bad.

14:47.027 --> 14:48.026
- Are you?

14:48.028 --> 14:49.147
He walked all over you.

14:49.693 --> 14:50.323
- Not really.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.331
Oh, shit, I can't
believe I forgot to tell

14:52.333 --> 14:53.766
you this.

14:53.768 --> 14:54.934
I saw him before
i moved out here.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.168
- You did?

14:56.170 --> 14:58.170
Yeah, he was like
sitting on the ground

14:58.172 --> 15:00.206
outside the Starbucks
in union square,

15:00.208 --> 15:03.209
and he had this like mustache.

15:03.211 --> 15:05.479
Well, I'm not like
necessarily against a mustache.

15:05.481 --> 15:06.913
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:06.915 --> 15:09.816
This was like a straggly
like wispy situation.

15:09.818 --> 15:10.917
- Ew.
- - It was glazed.

15:10.919 --> 15:11.918
It was horrible.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.186
- Ew.

15:13.188 --> 15:14.187
- I think he had a nose bleed.

15:14.387 --> 15:15.622
Oh my god, you're
messing with me.

15:15.822 --> 15:16.846
I think he
was just like bleeding

15:16.995 --> 15:17.858
all over the sidewalk.

15:18.058 --> 15:21.329
You're totally lying,
you're totally lying to me.

15:21.331 --> 15:23.164
No, I'm pretty
sure that's what happened.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.432
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:26.101 --> 15:28.202
Wait, so he told
you he liked me?

15:28.204 --> 15:29.303
- Who, Blake.

15:29.305 --> 15:30.138
- Yeah.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.439
- Yes, I think so.

15:31.441 --> 15:32.406
- Why didn't you tell me?

15:32.408 --> 15:34.308
- I am telling you.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.409
- Well, yeah, thanks.

15:35.411 --> 15:36.511
Like five years later.

15:36.513 --> 15:38.447
I didn't know
that you liked him.

15:38.449 --> 15:39.448
You really liked him?

15:39.450 --> 15:40.549
- Yes.

15:41.818 --> 15:42.518
- Whoops.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.486
I feel like you're
wrong anyways.

15:44.488 --> 15:46.121
- No, I'm not.

15:46.123 --> 15:47.790
Yes, you are, and
I'm remembering sort of...

15:47.792 --> 15:48.791
- excuse me.

15:48.793 --> 15:51.226
I am so sorry to interrupt.

15:51.228 --> 15:52.928
I mean, I never do
anything like this.

15:52.930 --> 15:55.999
I'm actually a private
person, you know, myself, but,

15:56.001 --> 15:58.902
haven't I seen you in something?

15:58.904 --> 16:00.270
You're in TV, right?

16:00.272 --> 16:01.905
- Yeah.

16:01.907 --> 16:02.906
- I knew it.

16:02.908 --> 16:03.907
I knew it.

16:03.909 --> 16:06.209
What have I seen you in?

16:06.211 --> 16:07.410
- I don't know.

16:07.412 --> 16:08.444
- Oh, gosh.

16:08.446 --> 16:08.974
I know it is.

16:09.174 --> 16:09.703
I think I know.

16:09.903 --> 16:13.150
Oh, I know, I remember,
it's wendecalm.

16:13.152 --> 16:15.252
You are so good in that.

16:15.254 --> 16:16.253
- Uh, thank you.

16:16.255 --> 16:17.321
- You were so good.

16:17.323 --> 16:18.322
- Thanks.

16:18.324 --> 16:19.523
- And so nice.

16:19.525 --> 16:22.026
Do you mind if i
get your autograph?

16:22.028 --> 16:24.228
Because it would
mean a lot to me.

16:24.230 --> 16:25.497
I'm Sandra.
- Sure.

16:25.499 --> 16:26.565
Sure.

16:26.567 --> 16:27.833
- Nice to meet you.

16:27.835 --> 16:29.000
Here's a fountain pen.

16:29.002 --> 16:30.468
I hope you like it.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.104
- This is my friend, Anna.

16:33.106 --> 16:34.906
She's also an actress.

16:34.908 --> 16:37.108
Have i
seen you in anything?

16:37.110 --> 16:39.177
- No, I would be surprised.

16:39.179 --> 16:41.614
- I am just blown away by this.

16:42.482 --> 16:45.218
Do you mind if I take a photo?

16:45.220 --> 16:46.135
- No, not at all.

16:46.578 --> 16:47.090
- Oh, my god.

16:47.290 --> 16:50.590
I'm like just so excited about
this, I can't even tell you.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.625
Uh, it's right there.

16:54.461 --> 16:55.361
Thank you.

16:58.433 --> 16:59.633
Thank you.
- Sure.

16:59.635 --> 17:02.269
- Okay, one, two, three.

18:22.121 --> 18:23.355
She went away.

18:24.424 --> 18:26.558
She turned the office
into a guest room,

18:26.560 --> 18:29.161
so that my cousin
could stay with her.

18:29.163 --> 18:30.562
- Oh, nice.

18:30.564 --> 18:34.000
Yeah, but he's
obviously not here anymore, so.

18:34.002 --> 18:35.068
- Great. Perfect.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.202
- Better, right?

18:36.204 --> 18:37.203
- Yeah, I love it.

18:37.205 --> 18:39.272
- Yeah, it's way better.

19:19.548 --> 19:20.783
It's beautiful, huh?

19:20.785 --> 19:21.684
- Hmm?

19:22.719 --> 19:23.686
- The view.

19:28.358 --> 19:31.494
Still don't get
any reception, huh?

20:20.146 --> 20:22.181
Do you remember that guy, Ryan?

20:22.183 --> 20:24.751
The one whose short I did
that went to Sundance?

20:24.753 --> 20:26.453
Well, he sent me
this feature script

20:26.455 --> 20:28.655
he's been working on,

20:28.657 --> 20:31.224
and he really wanted me to
show it to this producer

20:31.226 --> 20:33.626
on that movie I shot last June.

20:33.628 --> 20:36.729
I guess he like really wants
to work with this one producer,

20:36.731 --> 20:39.265
and like, wanted me
to show it to him.

20:39.267 --> 20:41.402
Oh, I left my shampoo in my bag.

20:41.404 --> 20:43.838
Do you mind grabbing it for me?

21:11.702 --> 21:13.336
Thanks.

21:13.338 --> 21:14.670
- So, what did you tell him?

21:14.672 --> 21:17.874
Oh, so I told him that
i didn't have a chance.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.775
Show the producers, you
know, and he was like,

21:19.777 --> 21:21.310
"what do you mean you
don't have a chance?

21:21.312 --> 21:22.912
"You've been on set all week."

21:22.914 --> 21:25.448
And I was like, "yeah, but the
producers aren't even there

21:25.450 --> 21:26.516
"every day."

21:28.418 --> 21:28.419
I don't know.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.854
I just feel like he
expects so much from me,

21:30.856 --> 21:34.758
and I, I'm just getting
my feet wet, you know?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.260
- Wait, what?

21:36.262 --> 21:37.427
- What?

21:37.429 --> 21:39.363
You're in the united
Hollywood issue?

21:39.365 --> 21:42.733
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.303
- Where did you get that?

21:45.305 --> 21:46.704
- From your bag.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.742
Why didn't you tell
me this happened?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.344
- I don't know.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.648
Do you think i
wouldn't find out?

21:56.650 --> 21:59.852
I, I really didn't
think about it.

21:59.854 --> 22:01.620
- I mean, this is crazy.

22:01.622 --> 22:03.756
This is so cool.

22:03.758 --> 22:06.392
I can't believe you wouldn't
have mentioned this before.

22:06.394 --> 22:07.860
- I don't know.

22:07.862 --> 22:11.697
I really, really don't
think it's that big a deal.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.832
- It's a really big deal.

22:16.336 --> 22:16.337
- I'm sorry.

22:18.472 --> 22:19.739
You don't have
to apologize to me.

22:19.741 --> 22:22.375
You should just be more excited

22:22.377 --> 22:24.844
when things like this happen.

22:28.950 --> 22:30.617
- No, you're right.

22:42.864 --> 22:44.799
You hit him?

22:44.801 --> 22:46.935
No, I mean,
i didn't hit him.

22:46.937 --> 22:48.503
I like shoved him.

22:49.706 --> 22:51.006
- But like, hard?

22:51.941 --> 22:53.875
- Uh, well, kind of.

22:57.413 --> 23:00.315
Okay, we were
standing at the bar,

23:01.417 --> 23:02.751
and Josh was saying
something that I

23:02.753 --> 23:04.687
like really didn't agree with,

23:04.689 --> 23:05.245
and so I chimed in,

23:05.445 --> 23:06.285
but obviously, it was a bar,

23:06.485 --> 23:08.891
so I started speaking
loudly, you know what I mean?

23:08.893 --> 23:09.892
- Right.

23:09.894 --> 23:11.527
Oh, I'm okay.

23:11.529 --> 23:13.029
Um, do you want some of this,

23:13.031 --> 23:14.764
'cause it's really good.

23:14.766 --> 23:16.366
- No.

23:16.368 --> 23:17.567
- All right.

23:17.569 --> 23:19.903
Are you really
not gonna have any?

23:19.905 --> 23:21.939
- Yeah, I mean, I'd like to,

23:21.941 --> 23:24.675
but I just, I've been
sleeping so much better

23:24.677 --> 23:26.310
since I stopped.

23:26.312 --> 23:28.012
I know, but it's not
like you have to get up

23:28.014 --> 23:31.482
for an audition
tomorrow morning.

23:31.484 --> 23:32.816
Come on.

23:32.818 --> 23:34.351
- Okay, just a little bit.

23:34.353 --> 23:34.986
A little.

23:34.988 --> 23:35.887
- Okay.

23:35.889 --> 23:37.022
- A little bit...

23:37.024 --> 23:38.857
- these are very small glasses.

23:38.859 --> 23:40.859
- That is not a little bit.

23:40.861 --> 23:43.561
Um, was Henry there?

23:43.563 --> 23:44.529
- Where?

23:44.531 --> 23:45.530
What, at the bar?

23:45.530 --> 23:45.332
- Yeah.

23:45.530 --> 23:45.332
No, he was the one
who encouraged me

23:45.532 --> 23:50.670
to participate in the
conversation in the first place,

23:50.672 --> 23:52.772
and so I was doing that,
i was just joining in,

23:52.774 --> 23:54.540
and Josh was like,
oh, okay, just,

23:54.542 --> 23:56.809
"first of all, can
you calm down?"

23:56.811 --> 23:58.711
- That's so annoying.

23:58.713 --> 23:59.393
- Right?

23:59.748 --> 24:00.498
I mean, Jesus.

24:00.698 --> 24:03.482
If I was a boy, no one would
be telling me to calm down.

24:03.484 --> 24:04.383
- True.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.021
- Oh, come on, Beth.

24:08.023 --> 24:11.992
Has anyone ever told you
to calm down in your life?

24:11.994 --> 24:13.093
Exactly.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.830
Anyways, yeah,

24:16.832 --> 24:20.033
so I could feel myself
getting like really upset,

24:20.035 --> 24:21.968
but I stopped myself,
'cause I was like, no, no,

24:21.970 --> 24:23.104
this is your
boyfriend's manager.

24:23.106 --> 24:24.739
You can't like,

24:24.741 --> 24:26.974
so, I walked away, 'cause
i was about to cry,

24:26.976 --> 24:28.076
and,

24:29.645 --> 24:31.166
then he comes after me.

24:31.995 --> 24:32.754
- Josh did?

24:32.954 --> 24:35.883
Yes, and I'm
like, "Josh, listen.

24:35.885 --> 24:37.085
"I have a really bad temper.

24:37.087 --> 24:38.954
"I need you to give
me some space, okay?"

24:39.120 --> 24:39.835
And he was like,
"yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:40.035 --> 24:41.657
"Okay, fine, but you know,
you don't have to walk away

24:41.659 --> 24:42.958
"like a prima Donna."

24:42.960 --> 24:44.593
- Oh my god.

24:44.595 --> 24:45.861
- Like, what?

24:45.863 --> 24:47.863
And he just kept saying
that, like prima Donna,

24:47.865 --> 24:49.932
prima Donna, prima Donna.

24:49.934 --> 24:51.066
- That is awful.

24:51.068 --> 24:52.634
- Yeah, and so, of course,

24:52.636 --> 24:55.772
I started like
hysterically crying,

24:55.774 --> 24:58.375
and I was so upset that yes,

24:59.877 --> 25:01.010
I pushed him.

25:04.014 --> 25:06.082
What? What would you do?

25:14.025 --> 25:18.129
You wouldn't get involved
in the first place.

25:25.704 --> 25:28.106
Just feel so out of control.

25:29.642 --> 25:30.842
- No.

25:30.844 --> 25:33.044
No, no, that's
really frustrating,

25:33.046 --> 25:35.046
what happened to you.

25:37.950 --> 25:38.850
- Yeah.

25:43.157 --> 25:47.593
And now, Henry's shooting
a commercial in Singapore,

25:49.096 --> 25:51.831
and he's letting me stay at
the house until he gets back,

25:51.833 --> 25:53.966
but after that, I'm like.

26:01.176 --> 26:02.743
No, you know what?

26:04.846 --> 26:05.979
I don't know.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.683
Henry's thinking was
like, career is important,

26:09.685 --> 26:10.984
but if you're in a relationship,

26:10.986 --> 26:13.220
then you have to put
that first, right?

26:13.222 --> 26:16.090
But like I always knew that
i just wasn't gonna be happy

26:16.092 --> 26:19.127
unless I accomplish
certain things first.

26:19.205 --> 26:20.212
Like, if you want
to be an actress,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.130
you have to establish
yourself before you're 30,

26:22.132 --> 26:24.065
or else, you're fucked.

26:24.067 --> 26:28.570
Plus, I really need to focus
on finding good representation.

26:28.572 --> 26:31.707
Especially, now,
before pilot season.

26:36.112 --> 26:40.549
God, you're so lucky to get
paid to do what you love.

26:43.587 --> 26:45.087
Yeah, I mean,
the stuff that I do

26:45.089 --> 26:47.924
isn't exactly Gibson, you know?

26:50.561 --> 26:54.197
Yeah, but, I mean, it
beats waiting tables.

26:57.702 --> 27:01.572
I've spent so much
money on head shots

27:01.574 --> 27:04.642
and stupid fucking
invisible braces.

27:09.715 --> 27:10.948
Stop, I'm fine.

27:13.085 --> 27:15.052
Seriously, I feel good.

27:19.259 --> 27:21.760
And hey, what the fuck?

27:21.762 --> 27:26.265
It will all be over soon
enough anyways, right?

27:54.964 --> 27:56.797
- Give me the keys.

27:56.799 --> 27:57.831
- Excuse me?

27:57.833 --> 27:58.999
Give me
the keys, bitch.

27:59.164 --> 27:59.757
- Why?

27:59.957 --> 28:02.870
Because you almost
just killed us like five times.

28:02.872 --> 28:03.938
Come on.

28:14.051 --> 28:14.950
Sazerac,

28:16.652 --> 28:19.120
and speaking in tongues.

28:19.122 --> 28:20.755
- Thank you.

28:22.025 --> 28:23.159
- Here, no I can get us...
- no, no, no.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.293
I got it.

28:24.295 --> 28:25.094
Can we keep it open?
- No, Beth.

28:25.096 --> 28:26.295
I can get my own drink...

28:26.297 --> 28:26.559
- I got it, I got it.

28:26.759 --> 28:27.899
- I can pay for my own drink.

28:28.099 --> 28:31.767
I know you can, but that
stupid beer commercial I did

28:31.769 --> 28:34.971
is playing like a
hundred times a day,

28:35.144 --> 28:36.067
and I'm making a lot of money,

28:36.267 --> 28:39.309
and I want to buy my best
friend a drink, okay?

28:39.311 --> 28:40.877
- Okay, thank you.

28:43.314 --> 28:45.616
- Cheers.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
Mmm.

28:50.322 --> 28:51.622
- Mmm.

28:53.892 --> 28:58.129
I know that I haven't been
the greatest friend lately.

28:59.765 --> 29:01.833
Oh, Jesus, you're
as drunk as I am.

29:01.835 --> 29:03.901
- No, I'm serious.

29:03.903 --> 29:05.870
I've been a bad friend.

29:06.972 --> 29:08.239
I mean, you broke
up with Henry, what,

29:08.241 --> 29:10.242
like two months ago, and
i just found out today?

29:10.244 --> 29:13.345
I really should have
been there for you.

29:13.347 --> 29:15.047
You must hate me.

29:17.217 --> 29:19.084
- I don't hate you.

29:21.187 --> 29:23.822
I really, I really
love you, Anna.

29:23.824 --> 29:25.425
You know that, right?

29:27.361 --> 29:31.931
And I'm really glad that we got
to have this weekend, alone.

29:31.933 --> 29:34.100
I've really missed you.

29:34.102 --> 29:36.169
- Yeah, I miss you too.

29:36.171 --> 29:38.938
And I know that like,
a lot has changed,

29:38.940 --> 29:43.878
and you're going through
some hard stuff right now,

29:43.880 --> 29:46.747
but I just, I think
you should know

29:46.749 --> 29:50.017
that I think you are
such a beautiful,

29:50.019 --> 29:52.319
wonderful person,
and you are so,

29:52.321 --> 29:55.256
so, so talented, and I just know

29:55.258 --> 29:58.126
that everything's gonna be fine.

30:06.202 --> 30:07.202
What?

30:07.204 --> 30:08.470
- No, don't look.

30:21.752 --> 30:23.886
The situation's pretty
sticky over there.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.289
The Chinese actually held
me for a couple of days

30:26.291 --> 30:29.359
on my last visit,
and, my translator

30:30.962 --> 30:34.998
sort of was a double agent,
and kinda got me out of it.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.899
- How?

30:37.268 --> 30:41.004
He just, sort of knew
what they wanted to hear.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.440
- Um, cheers.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.909
- Cheers.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.845
How did you get
the money over there?

30:46.847 --> 30:49.481
- I delivered it in a suitcase.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.016
- How much?

30:52.018 --> 30:55.019
I think it
was about 50 grand.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.522
- Oh my god, that's amazing.

30:57.524 --> 31:01.327
Well, it's,
it's not like I,

31:01.329 --> 31:04.196
I don't know, I've done this
kind of thing my whole life.

31:04.198 --> 31:07.166
I mean, you'll
see, you get older.

31:07.168 --> 31:08.334
- Oh, stop it, you're not old.

31:08.336 --> 31:09.335
- Really?

31:09.337 --> 31:10.503
How old do you think I am?

31:10.505 --> 31:11.470
- I don't know.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.439
20.

31:14.442 --> 31:15.474
- I'm 48.

31:15.476 --> 31:18.478
- 48, you're a young boy.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.281
Please, I could
be your father.

31:22.483 --> 31:24.117
Well, I like men
with a little salt

31:24.119 --> 31:25.252
and pepper in his hair.

31:25.254 --> 31:26.153
- Really?

31:34.863 --> 31:39.300
Um, okay, well is that
like what you're doing here,

31:39.302 --> 31:42.403
or is there a zendo
around here or something?

31:42.405 --> 31:45.439
Uh, well, tibetans
don't practice zen.

31:45.441 --> 31:48.811
They belong to the
mahayana school.

31:49.546 --> 31:51.113
Why? Do you practice zen?

31:51.115 --> 31:53.182
- No, my ex had a phase.

31:54.350 --> 31:55.551
- Oh.

31:55.553 --> 31:56.852
Well, there is a zendo here.

31:56.854 --> 31:59.555
It's, oh actually,
it's a monastery.

31:59.557 --> 32:01.089
Tassajara, but,

32:03.092 --> 32:07.297
I'm actually here for a
men's retreat at esalen.

32:08.567 --> 32:10.433
I know
what goes on there?

32:10.435 --> 32:11.534
- You do? What?

32:12.937 --> 32:15.305
That's where you guys
like sit around a fire,

32:15.307 --> 32:18.007
and like, bang drums, and thump
your chest, and everything,

32:18.009 --> 32:19.509
right?

32:19.511 --> 32:21.912
Well, we do a little of
that, if stuff comes up.

32:21.914 --> 32:24.181
- Stuff? If like stuff comes up?

32:24.183 --> 32:25.015
What sort of stuff?

32:25.017 --> 32:26.150
- Well, I don't know.

32:27.553 --> 32:28.485
Competition.

32:28.487 --> 32:29.486
- Competition?

32:29.488 --> 32:30.521
What does that mean?

32:30.523 --> 32:31.522
Like, what?

32:31.524 --> 32:32.957
What sort of competition?

32:33.157 --> 32:35.076
You should check out
tassajara while you're here,

32:35.276 --> 32:37.195
and maybe, spend a few
days in silent meditation.

32:37.197 --> 32:39.865
Shut up,
I'm just asking.

32:39.867 --> 32:42.100
- Is she always like this?

32:43.135 --> 32:44.402
- Excuse me.

32:44.404 --> 32:47.272
Your friend, is
she always so, um.

32:48.242 --> 32:49.241
- So what?

32:49.243 --> 32:50.242
- Curious?

32:50.244 --> 32:51.443
- So curious?

32:51.445 --> 32:54.113
I don't think that's
what you were gonna say.

32:54.115 --> 32:57.583
No, no, it's just
you're very inquisitive.

32:57.585 --> 33:00.453
I mean, I think
this is interesting.

33:00.455 --> 33:02.622
You are in a group
with a bunch of guys

33:02.624 --> 33:05.391
that if they get jealous
of you, you wrestle them.

33:05.393 --> 33:06.359
Like, what?

33:08.496 --> 33:10.898
Can I get
some help over here?

33:10.900 --> 33:12.166
- Oh, come on.

33:12.366 --> 33:13.884
You can't handle just like
a couple of questions.

33:14.084 --> 33:15.602
If I was in a woman's
group, you wouldn't be like,

33:15.604 --> 33:18.972
hey, that's something I'd like
to know a little more about?

33:18.974 --> 33:20.674
Will you excuse
me for just a sec.

33:20.676 --> 33:22.109
- Yeah.

33:32.454 --> 33:34.555
I should, I should
probably get going.

33:34.557 --> 33:36.991
I have gotta get up at the
ass crack of dawn tomorrow

33:36.993 --> 33:39.628
for a men's hike,
but, excuse me.

33:42.532 --> 33:44.366
I am taking off.

33:44.368 --> 33:46.235
I'd like to buy this
young lady a drink.

33:46.237 --> 33:48.070
What were you drinking?

33:48.072 --> 33:49.505
Uh, I guess I'll
get another sazerac.

33:49.507 --> 33:53.676
Sazerac, and
what was Beth drinking?

33:53.678 --> 33:55.345
I can't remember.

33:55.347 --> 33:58.581
Uh, it was like a
speaking in tongues.

33:58.583 --> 34:01.217
- Speaking in tongues,

34:01.219 --> 34:02.218
and a speaking in tongues.

34:02.220 --> 34:03.186
That should be plenty.

34:03.188 --> 34:04.087
Thank you.

34:05.556 --> 34:06.990
But, it's really
nice meeting you.

34:06.992 --> 34:07.691
- Mm-hmm.

34:10.561 --> 34:11.728
Anna.
- Anna.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.331
I'm sorry.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.734
Very nice to meet you, Anna.

34:18.103 --> 34:20.071
- Yeah, go, warm up.

34:22.608 --> 34:23.574
- Good night.

34:23.576 --> 34:25.443
- Bye.

34:40.493 --> 34:41.592
- Hey, it's me.

34:41.594 --> 34:43.596
I'm just checking in.

34:45.766 --> 34:47.199
You're asleep.

34:47.202 --> 34:52.672
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
that I really, really love you,

34:52.674 --> 34:53.773
and I miss you.

34:55.708 --> 34:58.644
There's no reception at the
house, so if I don't answer,

34:58.646 --> 35:01.181
that's why, but I love you.

35:03.151 --> 35:04.051
Okay.

35:04.786 --> 35:06.720
I love you.

35:06.722 --> 35:07.621
Bye.

35:32.215 --> 35:34.050
- Hey, you.

35:34.052 --> 35:35.651
I was wondering where
you snuck off to.

35:35.653 --> 35:38.387
- Oh, I was just making a call.

35:38.389 --> 35:40.122
The reception
really sucks out here.

35:40.124 --> 35:41.190
- Yeah.

35:41.192 --> 35:42.792
- It's the mountains.

35:44.795 --> 35:47.731
Listen, I was wondering
if, I don't know,

35:47.733 --> 35:52.269
would you be interested in
maybe getting a drink sometime?

35:52.271 --> 35:53.537
- Oh, uh.

35:53.539 --> 35:55.672
I mean, I'm here with my friend.

35:55.674 --> 35:57.841
- No, I mean, back in la.

35:58.810 --> 36:00.777
- Oh, right. Obviously.

36:02.714 --> 36:04.715
Or, we could,
we can get dinner.

36:04.717 --> 36:06.684
I have, a friend of mine, bill,

36:06.686 --> 36:08.486
they just opened up this
place, in abakany, that,

36:08.488 --> 36:12.390
it's nice, the chef's
kaiser michelin star.

36:12.392 --> 36:14.859
Um, how would next Friday work?

36:16.829 --> 36:17.728
- Um.

36:18.665 --> 36:19.832
Sure.

36:19.834 --> 36:21.567
- Okay.

36:23.370 --> 36:24.803
Um, can I get your number?

36:24.805 --> 36:26.839
- Oh, yeah.

38:48.857 --> 38:49.757
Morning.

39:04.307 --> 39:05.507
- What's that?

39:05.509 --> 39:07.976
Oh, it's just
this stupid script.

39:07.978 --> 39:09.278
So stupid.

39:10.947 --> 39:11.598
- What is it?

39:11.798 --> 39:12.449
- It's this,

39:14.652 --> 39:16.586
it's just a really
dumb horror movie.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.954
- Another one?

39:17.956 --> 39:19.055
- Yeah, I know.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.293
This one is especially stupid.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.361
It's embarrassing.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.896
- What's it about?

39:26.898 --> 39:27.997
- Um,

39:29.401 --> 39:30.534
it's nothing.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.771
It's just, um.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.441
- It's about nothing?

39:37.443 --> 39:38.876
- It's about stones.

39:38.878 --> 39:42.946
It's set in Iceland, where,
i guess, they have this

39:42.948 --> 39:46.818
whole mythology where
stones turn into trolls,

39:46.820 --> 39:51.056
but it's a red herring,
because it's a serial killer,

39:51.991 --> 39:55.427
only you think it's
trolls for a while.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.897
This is something
Adele gave you?

39:58.899 --> 40:00.398
- Um, it's, yeah.

40:01.835 --> 40:04.737
I mean, it's really terrible.

40:04.739 --> 40:07.807
Okay, but, she
wants you to do it?

40:11.545 --> 40:12.678
- I think so.

40:13.914 --> 40:15.781
- Why?

40:15.783 --> 40:17.451
- Um, I don't know.

40:18.119 --> 40:19.753
It's bigger.

40:19.755 --> 40:21.655
Yeah, but why
does she want you to do it?

40:21.657 --> 40:24.891
I guess, because
I'm in every scene.

40:28.096 --> 40:29.496
- It's the lead?

40:30.465 --> 40:31.732
- I guess.

40:31.734 --> 40:34.001
I mean, yeah, yeah.

40:34.003 --> 40:36.571
Also, also, it's against type.

40:38.875 --> 40:40.074
What's your type?

40:40.076 --> 40:42.009
- I don't know.

40:42.011 --> 40:45.146
What, like the
wilting flower type?

40:47.116 --> 40:48.015
- I guess.

40:50.854 --> 40:52.654
- And what's this?

40:52.656 --> 40:54.056
- Uh,

40:54.058 --> 40:56.091
I don't know, like
sassy, I guess.

40:56.093 --> 40:57.593
It's really so bad.

40:57.595 --> 40:57.793
It's so bad.

40:59.829 --> 41:02.631
You have to take
your clothes off?

41:02.633 --> 41:04.533
- What do you think?

41:04.535 --> 41:05.935
- Jesus, again.

41:05.937 --> 41:07.470
- I know.

41:07.472 --> 41:11.107
I know, it's like the
tenth time in two years.

41:15.746 --> 41:18.415
- You ever feel like a whore?

41:19.850 --> 41:20.750
- Um.

41:23.822 --> 41:27.425
I don't know, yeah,
sometimes, a little.

41:32.063 --> 41:33.431
I wanted to tell you,

41:33.433 --> 41:36.567
I sent the link to
your reel, to Adele.

41:36.569 --> 41:37.702
- You did?

41:37.704 --> 41:39.871
When did you send it?

41:39.873 --> 41:43.175
Um, I don't know,
like a while ago.

41:43.177 --> 41:44.142
- Like what?

41:44.144 --> 41:45.610
Like, a month ago?

41:45.612 --> 41:48.013
- Yeah, maybe two weeks ago.

41:49.615 --> 41:51.483
I don't know why you want
to work with her, though.

41:51.485 --> 41:55.121
I mean, they send me
out on the worst stuff.

41:55.123 --> 41:59.826
It must be nice not
being all alone, though.

41:59.828 --> 42:01.127
Like to have somebody
besides yourself

42:01.129 --> 42:03.196
invested in your career.

42:04.798 --> 42:08.669
I mean, yeah, I guess,
when you put it that way.

42:08.671 --> 42:11.672
What other way
is there to put it?

42:15.877 --> 42:17.911
You want to run it?

42:18.111 --> 42:18.455
- What, this?

42:18.655 --> 42:20.547
No, let's do some other
script we were talking about.

42:20.549 --> 42:22.483
- No, not really.

42:22.485 --> 42:23.984
- Maybe I can help.

42:23.986 --> 42:24.986
There's really no point.

42:24.988 --> 42:27.856
I'm totally wrong for it.

42:27.858 --> 42:29.090
- Come on.

42:29.092 --> 42:30.525
It'll be fun.

42:30.527 --> 42:33.561
We never get to act
together anymore.

42:33.563 --> 42:34.262
Okay.

42:35.831 --> 42:39.267
I think it's time we started
to think outside the box.

42:39.269 --> 42:41.203
- Outside the box?

42:41.365 --> 42:41.448
- Yeah.

42:41.648 --> 42:44.874
I've never even
understood what that means.

42:44.876 --> 42:46.108
- Outside the box?

42:46.110 --> 42:48.143
It means to like think
in a different way.

42:48.343 --> 42:48.760
- Really?

42:50.680 --> 42:52.214
This isn't the time
for sarcasm, sharlene.

42:52.216 --> 42:54.149
We're stuck out here in the
middle of the arctic tundra,

42:54.151 --> 42:56.085
freezing our asses off.

42:56.087 --> 42:57.554
Our thermos is almost empty.

42:57.556 --> 42:58.955
I've had to pee
for like six hours,

42:59.155 --> 42:59.645
but I'm afraid to go,

42:59.845 --> 43:02.092
because I think the pee
might freeze inside my dick.

43:02.094 --> 43:03.093
- You have a dick?

43:03.095 --> 43:05.529
I thought you were a dick.

43:07.632 --> 43:08.532
- Really?

43:09.667 --> 43:12.303
That's how you're
gonna say the line?

43:12.305 --> 43:16.240
Jesus, Beth, no wonder
you keep getting typecast.

43:16.242 --> 43:17.542
You're supposed to
be sassy, right?

43:17.544 --> 43:19.043
So, be sassy.

43:19.045 --> 43:20.278
- I don't even want the part.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.279
- Oh, bullshit.

43:21.281 --> 43:23.614
Just be fucking sassy.

43:23.616 --> 43:24.682
What the fuck? It's easy.

43:24.684 --> 43:26.317
Here, you be the guy.

43:30.256 --> 43:33.592
I think it's time we started
to think outside the box.

43:33.594 --> 43:34.826
- Outside the box?

43:34.828 --> 43:36.194
- Yep.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.730
I've never even
understood what that means.

43:38.732 --> 43:39.965
- Outside the box.

43:39.967 --> 43:41.300
It means like to think
in a different way.

43:41.302 --> 43:42.668
- Oh, really?

43:45.139 --> 43:47.273
This isn't the time
for sarcasm, sharlene.

43:47.275 --> 43:49.275
We're stuck out here in the
middle of the arctic tundra,

43:49.277 --> 43:51.244
freezing our asses off.

43:52.146 --> 43:53.713
Our thermos is almost empty.

43:53.715 --> 43:55.281
I've had to pee
for like six hours,

43:55.481 --> 43:55.931
but I'm afraid to go,

43:56.131 --> 43:58.851
because I think the pee
might freeze inside my dick.

43:58.853 --> 43:59.987
- Oh, you have a dick?

43:59.989 --> 44:02.656
I thought you just were a dick.

44:02.658 --> 44:04.091
- Is that helpful?

44:04.093 --> 44:06.727
Was it helpful when
you dragged me out here

44:06.729 --> 44:09.096
on this so-called adventure?

44:09.098 --> 44:10.230
Was it helpful when
you ate all the food,

44:10.232 --> 44:13.601
like a fucking pig,
four hours ago?

44:15.737 --> 44:17.706
- I offered you a bite.

44:20.009 --> 44:22.243
- You're a fucking retard.

44:25.081 --> 44:26.281
- That's not PC.

44:27.383 --> 44:30.285
You think I give
a shit about PC?

44:32.122 --> 44:34.256
We're gonna die out here.

44:34.258 --> 44:37.159
Do you get that,
you piece of shit?

44:37.161 --> 44:41.230
We're going to die, and
it's your fucking fault!

44:42.866 --> 44:44.300
You're life is over.

44:44.302 --> 44:46.035
My life is over.

44:46.037 --> 44:47.904
We are gonna freeze
to fucking death

44:47.906 --> 44:50.007
in the fucking freezing tundra,

44:50.009 --> 44:52.409
and it's your fucking fault!

44:58.383 --> 45:00.817
That's how you play sassy.

45:05.257 --> 45:06.991
Let's go for a hike.

45:38.727 --> 45:40.694
Is that Matt Dickinson?

45:43.264 --> 45:44.364
- Hey.

45:45.433 --> 45:47.067
- Hi.
- - Hi, how are you?

45:47.280 --> 45:48.592
- Good, how are you?

45:48.792 --> 45:51.405
I was wondering if i
was gonna bump into you guys.

45:51.407 --> 45:52.440
- What?

45:52.442 --> 45:54.275
What are you doing here?

45:54.277 --> 45:56.977
- You didn't tell her?

45:56.979 --> 45:58.879
Am I that unmemorable?

46:00.348 --> 46:02.983
No, I just bumped
into Beth at capecita,

46:02.985 --> 46:04.385
and mentioned i
was coming up here.

46:04.387 --> 46:05.486
- Oh.

46:06.321 --> 46:09.424
No, she didn't
mention that at all.

46:09.426 --> 46:11.126
What are you doing here?

46:11.128 --> 46:14.429
Uh, well, I'm hiking, but
I'm also location scouting

46:14.431 --> 46:16.898
for this experimental
short I'm doing.

46:17.098 --> 46:17.326
- Oh.

46:17.526 --> 46:19.468
I was telling Beth that
i wanted to talk to you

46:19.470 --> 46:21.737
about maybe being in it.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.373
- Oh.

46:24.375 --> 46:25.374
Uh, cool.

46:25.376 --> 46:26.409
- Yeah, yeah.

46:26.411 --> 46:29.178
It's super low budget, but,

46:29.180 --> 46:31.181
you really didn't mention this?

46:31.381 --> 46:33.382
Yeah, what are
you trying to do?

46:33.582 --> 46:35.518
Keep me from getting
cast in things?

46:36.386 --> 46:37.386
You should just cast Beth.

46:37.388 --> 46:38.421
Everyone else does.

46:38.423 --> 46:39.423
- Oh, yeah.

46:39.425 --> 46:40.858
I know, right?

46:40.860 --> 46:41.825
Beth's way too big
time for us now.

46:43.796 --> 46:46.163
Yep, well, anyways,
thanks for thinking of me.

46:46.165 --> 46:47.197
That's awesome.

46:47.199 --> 46:48.398
- Yeah, no.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.167
Figured, I don't know,
it'd be something

46:50.169 --> 46:52.169
that you'd be up for.

46:52.171 --> 46:52.579
- Yeah.

46:52.779 --> 46:53.187
- Mm-hmm.

46:53.387 --> 46:55.440
Paul said he saw
your last short online,

46:55.442 --> 46:57.442
and it was interesting.

46:58.410 --> 47:00.345
You're really lucky.

47:04.016 --> 47:06.217
Have you been to
big sur bakery yet?

47:06.219 --> 47:08.119
No, do
they have cookies.

47:08.121 --> 47:09.487
Uh, yeah, they have
really good cookies.

47:09.489 --> 47:11.190
They also have
really good dinner.

47:11.192 --> 47:12.224
- Awesome.

47:12.226 --> 47:13.292
Yeah, I'll have to try that.

47:13.294 --> 47:14.460
- Where are you staying?

47:14.462 --> 47:16.295
This
really fancy place,

47:16.297 --> 47:17.830
super in the middle of nowhere.

47:17.832 --> 47:18.898
Just opened up.

47:18.900 --> 47:20.166
- Oh, what's it called?

47:20.168 --> 47:21.400
It's called
a tent in the woods.

47:23.538 --> 47:25.137
What about you all?

47:25.139 --> 47:26.907
I'm staying at
my aunt's house.

47:26.909 --> 47:28.809
It's, do you know
the area at all?

47:28.811 --> 47:30.310
- Yeah.

47:30.312 --> 47:33.113
Okay, it's just off the
road, near big sur station.

47:33.115 --> 47:35.582
- Oh, pfeiffer Ridge?

47:35.584 --> 47:36.950
- Yeah.

47:36.952 --> 47:38.819
Well, sycamore canyon,
but yeah, yeah.

47:38.821 --> 47:40.353
You do know the area.

47:40.355 --> 47:42.890
Can I talk to
you for a second?

47:42.892 --> 47:43.591
- Uh, now?

47:44.560 --> 47:45.459
- Yeah.

47:47.429 --> 47:48.529
- Okay.

47:52.501 --> 47:54.502
Um, well, I guess I have to go.

47:54.504 --> 47:55.503
- Is she okay?

47:55.505 --> 47:57.071
- Yeah.

47:57.073 --> 47:59.608
I mean, I'm sure she'll be fine.

48:01.845 --> 48:02.845
- Okay.

48:02.847 --> 48:06.148
Yeah, well, I'll
give you a call.

48:06.150 --> 48:07.416
Think I have your number.

48:07.616 --> 48:07.716
- Yeah.

48:07.916 --> 48:09.585
I mean, I know we're
Facebook friends, so...

48:09.587 --> 48:10.986
- Right.

48:10.988 --> 48:12.588
So, if I don't have
your number, I'll just...

48:12.590 --> 48:14.557
- yeah, right. Yeah.

48:14.559 --> 48:15.892
I'm really sorry about her...

48:15.894 --> 48:17.093
- oh, no. Of course.

48:17.095 --> 48:18.361
Go, go, go.
- Okay, bye.

48:18.363 --> 48:19.495
- Bye.

48:45.490 --> 48:46.658
- What is it?

48:48.594 --> 48:49.661
- It's just.

48:53.933 --> 48:55.400
- What?

48:55.402 --> 48:59.170
I just never seen someone
look at me with so much disgust?

49:02.276 --> 49:06.112
I just, I just realized
how much you hate me,

49:07.948 --> 49:11.584
and I, I feel really sad
about our friendship.

49:59.569 --> 50:02.538
- Hey, you all right?

50:02.540 --> 50:03.706
- Yeah. Yeah.

50:04.975 --> 50:06.142
- You sure?
- Yeah.

50:06.144 --> 50:07.711
- You don't want a lift?

50:07.713 --> 50:10.613
- No, I'm not going that far.

50:10.615 --> 50:11.514
I'm fine.

50:12.650 --> 50:13.583
I'm not
gonna do anything.

50:13.585 --> 50:14.684
I'm just trying to be nice.

50:14.686 --> 50:16.619
Where you going?

50:16.621 --> 50:17.721
- Um.

50:19.690 --> 50:21.691
Sycamore canyon.

50:21.693 --> 50:23.728
- That's not close.

50:23.730 --> 50:27.064
That's five miles down the road.

50:27.066 --> 50:30.234
Come on, it's gonna get cold.

50:30.236 --> 50:31.135
Come on.

50:32.671 --> 50:33.771
Hey, it's okay.

51:14.649 --> 51:16.316
Nice place.

51:48.718 --> 51:49.852
- Hello, hello.

51:51.254 --> 51:52.321
- Hello.

51:52.323 --> 51:53.556
- Hello. Paul?

51:55.592 --> 51:56.559
Yes, yes.

51:56.561 --> 51:57.761
Can you hear me?

52:00.198 --> 52:01.698
Can you hear me?

52:03.302 --> 52:04.601
Paul.

52:05.856 --> 52:06.176
Hold on.

52:06.376 --> 52:08.371
I'm gonna call you back
from the land line, okay?

52:08.373 --> 52:10.707
Please, don't go anywhere.

52:24.389 --> 52:26.124
This weekend's a
fucking disaster.

52:26.126 --> 52:27.758
Honey, can you speak up?

52:27.760 --> 52:31.530
No, I am telling you,
she fucking hates me.

52:31.532 --> 52:33.665
She thinks that I have
this like amazing career,

52:33.667 --> 52:36.168
and that I purposely
fucked her over.

52:36.170 --> 52:37.402
Beth, can you speak up?

52:37.404 --> 52:38.637
- No, I can't speak up.

52:38.639 --> 52:40.539
I don't know if
she's here or not.

52:40.739 --> 52:41.087
I can't hear you.

52:41.287 --> 52:44.376
Uh, she thinks I fucked
her over on purpose.

52:44.378 --> 52:46.579
Why does
she think you fucked her over?

52:46.581 --> 52:49.849
Because I didn't tell
her about Matt's thing.

52:49.851 --> 52:50.850
- What thing?

52:50.852 --> 52:52.819
- The thing. The short.

52:52.821 --> 52:55.321
Matt's thing, Matt's short film.

52:55.323 --> 52:57.290
- What?

52:58.492 --> 52:59.792
- It doesn't matter.

52:59.794 --> 53:01.829
It's mainly the
thing with Adele.

53:01.831 --> 53:03.497
What thing with Adele?

53:03.499 --> 53:06.767
Oh my god, do you even listen
to me when I talk to you?

53:06.769 --> 53:08.702
She wanted me to
send Adele her reel?

53:08.704 --> 53:10.538
Don't you remember
me telling you that?

53:10.540 --> 53:11.529
- Right, yeah.

53:11.729 --> 53:12.666
You thought it was too soon.

53:12.866 --> 53:14.742
Exactly, and I was
going to send it,

53:14.744 --> 53:17.913
but I had only been with
Adele for like three months,

53:17.915 --> 53:19.581
and she wanted me to
send Adele the link

53:19.583 --> 53:23.485
to her awful fucking website,
and I was going to do it,

53:23.487 --> 53:25.820
but then she got so crazy
and intense about it,

53:25.822 --> 53:28.757
so then, I just told
her that I had sent it.

53:28.759 --> 53:29.925
I
really don't understand

53:29.927 --> 53:32.360
why you do stuff like that.

53:32.362 --> 53:34.630
- I was going to send it.

53:34.632 --> 53:36.365
Yeah, well, why lie?

53:36.367 --> 53:38.334
Could you not give me
the third degree right now?

53:38.336 --> 53:41.637
I am telling you, she's acting
completely fucking crazy.

53:41.639 --> 53:42.638
You
sure you don't want me

53:42.640 --> 53:43.873
to come up there and get you?

53:43.875 --> 53:44.774
- No. No.

53:44.776 --> 53:47.777
I'll just check into
a hotel or something.

53:47.779 --> 53:50.714
I just, this is all because
i got cast in a couple

53:50.716 --> 53:52.916
of terrible fucking movies
that I didn't even want

53:52.918 --> 53:54.851
to be in in the first place.

53:54.853 --> 53:55.886
Let me come get you.

53:55.888 --> 53:57.487
- No.

53:57.489 --> 53:58.655
I'll come
get you after my meeting.

53:58.657 --> 53:59.990
- I just.

53:59.992 --> 54:03.627
Why can't she just
be happy for me?

54:03.629 --> 54:06.831
I just am trying so
hard to be nice to her,

54:06.833 --> 54:10.401
even though she's so
disgusting and desperate.

54:10.403 --> 54:13.404
I mean, she knows that i
think she's a better actress

54:13.406 --> 54:14.305
than I am.

54:14.307 --> 54:16.841
I just happen to have
a fucking certain look

54:16.843 --> 54:19.811
that people like right now.

54:19.813 --> 54:21.814
- Beth.

54:22.916 --> 54:24.850
- I have to go.

54:28.689 --> 54:31.957
You think I'm
desperate and disgusting?

54:32.892 --> 54:34.960
You're fucking pathetic.

54:36.998 --> 54:40.000
Jesus, you act so
fucking innocent.

54:42.336 --> 54:43.637
But you're not.

54:44.705 --> 54:47.607
I mean, you're a
fucking liar, right?

54:47.609 --> 54:49.676
Tell me, does it get
tiring just pretending

54:49.678 --> 54:52.980
to be so fucking
helpless all the time?

54:54.916 --> 54:58.019
God, you think you're
so much better than me.

54:58.021 --> 54:59.720
You're not.

55:03.659 --> 55:06.694
You're a fucking phony,
and a narcissist,

55:06.696 --> 55:09.498
and a horrible fucking friend.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.766
You can't even
help me get a part

55:10.768 --> 55:13.435
in a fucking avant-garde short?

55:16.873 --> 55:18.407
What?

55:18.409 --> 55:19.708
Yes, cry, Beth.

55:20.509 --> 55:20.510
Cry.

55:22.045 --> 55:24.647
Fake fucking crocodile tears.

55:24.649 --> 55:26.082
You fake fucking Hollywood cunt.

56:22.542 --> 56:25.010
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

56:25.012 --> 56:27.046
I'm on my way up.

56:27.048 --> 56:30.884
I have no idea
where I'm going, so,

56:30.886 --> 56:33.086
can you please call me back?

01:01:56.464 --> 01:01:58.932
- Just whenever you're ready.

01:02:02.404 --> 01:02:03.838
This is my second
day in big sur,

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.873
and I'm standing there
with this like woman

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:07.441
who wants to make
sure that the death

01:02:07.443 --> 01:02:10.511
of her like chihuahua
has been avenged.

01:02:12.514 --> 01:02:14.281
You want a refill?

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:17.384
- No, I'm okay. Thank you.

01:02:18.254 --> 01:02:19.488
Um, no, I just.

01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:21.156
I shouldn't, i
don't really drink.

01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:22.390
- What are you talking about?

01:02:22.392 --> 01:02:23.458
You have, you just
had a cocktail.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.760
- Yes.

01:02:26.229 --> 01:02:29.331
Um, I just won't be able
to sleep if I have more

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.432
than one.

01:02:33.837 --> 01:02:36.205
You think I'm trying
to get you drunk?

01:02:36.207 --> 01:02:37.440
I'm not trying to get you drunk.

01:02:37.442 --> 01:02:38.775
I took a vow of
celibacy for the month,

01:02:38.777 --> 01:02:41.844
so you're totally safe with me.

01:02:41.846 --> 01:02:45.782
Seriously, no sex, no
masturbation, nothing.

01:02:47.184 --> 01:02:49.418
I'm basically like a monk.

01:02:50.522 --> 01:02:52.256
I'm not trying to, I'm sorry.

01:02:52.258 --> 01:02:55.959
I don't mean to be pushy, I'm
just enjoying talking to you.

01:02:58.897 --> 01:03:00.030
Well, do you want
to keep hanging out?

01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:01.532
I have, um,

01:03:01.534 --> 01:03:03.167
I close out in 30 minutes.

01:03:03.169 --> 01:03:04.935
I was thinking, maybe
you want to go swimming.

01:03:04.937 --> 01:03:07.405
I know a place we could
go night swimming.

01:03:07.407 --> 01:03:08.306
- Oh.

01:03:09.475 --> 01:03:11.843
Remember,
this is like a monk.

01:03:13.079 --> 01:03:14.512
- Shut up.

01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:18.180
- Get up.

01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:23.118
Get up, I want to
show you something.

01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:43.007
Wait, stay still.

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:44.041
What are you doing?

01:04:44.043 --> 01:04:46.076
You gotta give me a pose.

01:04:46.078 --> 01:04:49.413
First of all, you can't be
moving around like that.

01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:51.015
You can't be moving
around like that.

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:53.183
You gotta give me a pose.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.255
That's the pose
you're gonna give me?

01:04:57.257 --> 01:04:58.690
That is not a pose.

01:04:59.692 --> 01:05:00.692
What's the matter?

01:05:00.694 --> 01:05:02.627
Are you feeling self conscious?

01:05:02.629 --> 01:05:04.029
Stay. Like this.

01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:06.564
This is great.

01:05:06.566 --> 01:05:09.567
Just like that, stay like that.

01:05:09.569 --> 01:05:10.435
Oh, yes.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:14.006
You look like an angel.

01:05:33.261 --> 01:05:34.428
So, you're an actor.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:35.495
That's cool.

01:05:40.335 --> 01:05:42.536
Well, the stuff I do
is not exactly

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:43.437
you know?

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.441
- I actually don't,

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.110
'cause I don't
know what that is.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.547
You have any like gigs
coming up, or anything?

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.449
Anything interesting?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.350
- No.

01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:58.386
- Really?
- No, nothing.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.724
It seems
like maybe you do.

01:06:01.726 --> 01:06:04.493
- I there's this stupid movie.

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:07.296
It's so stupid.

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:11.166
- What's it called?

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:14.103
- It's called the stones.

01:06:14.105 --> 01:06:16.572
It's really so dumb.

01:06:16.574 --> 01:06:18.608
It's this dumb horror movie.

01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:21.611
- I like horror movies.

01:06:21.613 --> 01:06:24.414
Really, that's my
favorite kind of movie.

01:06:24.416 --> 01:06:26.249
What is this one?

01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:27.384
- It's, it's,

01:06:28.486 --> 01:06:30.720
this one is especially stupid.

01:06:30.722 --> 01:06:32.590
It's, embarrassing.

01:06:36.661 --> 01:06:37.762
- Try me.

01:06:37.764 --> 01:06:39.363
What's it about?

01:06:40.632 --> 01:06:42.366
- It's about stones.

01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:46.270
- What about 'em?

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.439
- It's about stones.

01:06:48.441 --> 01:06:50.675
It's, I don't know,
set in Iceland,

01:06:50.677 --> 01:06:52.711
where, I guess, they
have this weird mythology

01:06:52.713 --> 01:06:56.648
where stones turn into
trolls, or something,

01:06:57.717 --> 01:06:59.251
only that's a red
herring, because, really,

01:06:59.253 --> 01:07:02.821
it's this serial killer,
but, for a while,

01:07:03.656 --> 01:07:06.726
you think it is trolls,
and, I don't know.

01:07:06.728 --> 01:07:09.762
It's, I told you,
it's so embarrassing.

01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:10.797
- I like it.

01:07:12.299 --> 01:07:14.434
I think it sounds
good, and I'm sure

01:07:14.436 --> 01:07:16.135
that you're gonna
be great in it,

01:07:16.137 --> 01:07:18.438
and then it'll come
out, and be a big hit,

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.142
and I can tell all my
friends I know a movie star.

01:07:22.144 --> 01:07:23.310
Just
whenever you're ready.

01:07:23.312 --> 01:07:25.112
- Oh, thanks.

01:07:26.181 --> 01:07:27.714
Oh, i
forgot to tell you.

01:07:27.716 --> 01:07:28.849
Lucinda's band is playing
this weekend in monterey,

01:07:28.851 --> 01:07:31.185
and a bunch of us
are driving up.

01:07:31.187 --> 01:07:32.686
I don't know if
you're interested.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.593
Don't you ever get tired

01:07:38.595 --> 01:07:41.329
of pretending to be so helpless?

01:07:42.531 --> 01:07:44.399
- Hey! Where you going?

01:07:44.401 --> 01:07:45.834
What are you doing?

01:07:49.205 --> 01:07:50.872
What's the matter with you?

01:07:50.874 --> 01:07:53.209
You're jealous of Violet?

01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:56.112
There's nothing
going on with Violet.

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:57.480
We fucked like a year ago.

01:07:57.482 --> 01:07:59.482
Like a couple times.

01:07:59.484 --> 01:08:02.218
There's five girls in this town.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.854
It's very flattering.

01:08:08.426 --> 01:08:10.494
You gonna get over this?

01:08:10.496 --> 01:08:12.295
She's not looking at us, right?

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:13.797
Is she over there?

01:08:15.767 --> 01:08:16.867
All right.

01:08:18.202 --> 01:08:19.836
It's very flattering.

01:08:19.837 --> 01:08:21.904
I have a big day
planned for us, though.

01:08:21.907 --> 01:08:23.140
Okay?

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.175
I got the day off.

01:08:24.176 --> 01:08:26.743
I want to take you to a party.

01:08:27.578 --> 01:08:28.880
It's very sweet.

01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:29.846
You got jealous.

01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:19.832
I don't want
to go back to la.

01:09:19.835 --> 01:09:20.935
- Why not?

01:09:23.238 --> 01:09:24.939
- Just terrible there.

01:09:26.341 --> 01:09:28.310
- So stay here.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.417
- What would I do?

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.520
- I don't know.

01:09:38.522 --> 01:09:40.421
Figure it out.

01:09:40.424 --> 01:09:41.456
- I could have a garden.

01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:42.957
- You could.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960
You like gardening?

01:09:43.962 --> 01:09:44.160
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:46.897 --> 01:09:49.631
I like being outside in the sun.

01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:53.269
In the rain, and.

01:09:55.906 --> 01:09:57.740
- You like fog?

01:09:57.742 --> 01:09:59.408
There's a lot of fog.

01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:01.245
- That sounds nice.

01:10:01.846 --> 01:10:04.348
Being in a garden in the fog.

01:10:07.552 --> 01:10:09.319
'Cause I like to cook.

01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:10.554
- Mmm.

01:10:10.556 --> 01:10:14.825
I like to eat, so, you
see how that worked out?

01:10:14.827 --> 01:10:16.327
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:16.329 --> 01:10:19.397
We're
made for each other.

01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:40.986
Are you
talking about me or the beer?

01:10:40.988 --> 01:10:42.755
- Matt, it's Paul.

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:45.958
Beth's boyfriend.

01:10:47.495 --> 01:10:49.729
Uh, I'm in big sur, and...

01:10:51.966 --> 01:10:55.468
I can't seem to get
in touch with Beth.

01:11:17.092 --> 01:11:18.726
- Yeah, hi!

01:11:23.032 --> 01:11:24.366
What is this?

01:11:25.935 --> 01:11:26.968
- It's my costume.

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:28.003
- It's beautiful, hi.

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:30.539
Come on, come on in.

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:31.940
Boy, I thought you
were gonna be a pig.

01:11:31.942 --> 01:11:33.108
I got it
at a thrift store.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.509
I am a pig.

01:11:34.511 --> 01:11:35.111
But you
don't look like a pig.

01:11:35.113 --> 01:11:35.912
- Wait, wait.

01:11:36.646 --> 01:11:37.998
No, you're like
that handsome dude in a tux.

01:11:38.198 --> 01:11:40.083
No, no, no,
I'm a capitalist pig.

01:11:40.085 --> 01:11:40.783
Look. Look.

01:11:42.086 --> 01:11:43.753
All right, you're
a capitalist pig.

01:11:43.755 --> 01:11:46.422
Wait, I gotta, hold, hold on.

01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:48.458
Joplin come
down and see Jesse.

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.459
Yeah, he's a pig.

01:11:49.461 --> 01:11:52.396
- Bring it in. My man.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.501
Mom, can
i get my costume on?

01:11:57.503 --> 01:11:58.869
Yeah, yeah,
if you're quick, though.

01:11:58.871 --> 01:11:59.186
I'm starving.

01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:00.016
- Cool, let's do it.

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:04.041
Don't give
Jesse a hard time.

01:12:04.977 --> 01:12:06.745
Okay, red is okay?

01:12:07.947 --> 01:12:11.116
So, how long have the two
of you been going out for?

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.084
- Oh, we just met yesterday.

01:12:13.086 --> 01:12:15.653
Yeah, has he painted
your picture yet?

01:12:15.655 --> 01:12:16.554
- Oh, god, Jack.

01:12:17.391 --> 01:12:18.156
Don't listen to him.

01:12:18.158 --> 01:12:20.024
He's just jealous because Jesse

01:12:20.026 --> 01:12:22.427
brought such a pretty girl
home, and he's tired of me,

01:12:22.429 --> 01:12:23.929
because I'm old.

01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:24.997
- Yep.

01:12:26.934 --> 01:12:28.667
- Holy crap.

01:12:29.469 --> 01:12:31.704
Holy crap, it's Frankenstein!

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:37.743
- Save me! Save me!

01:12:38.981 --> 01:12:41.014
Oh my god! Oh no,
I'm gonna faint.

01:12:41.016 --> 01:12:42.015
Uh, I can't breathe.

01:12:42.017 --> 01:12:43.183
I can't, I can't.

01:12:43.185 --> 01:12:44.117
Oh, no, no.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.720
He's choking me!

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.757
Wait, wait, somebody, someone.

01:12:53.094 --> 01:12:56.164
And I'm back from the dead,
and now, I'm gonna kill you!

01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:59.000
And then, I'm gonna
make you set the table.

01:12:59.002 --> 01:13:00.601
To help mommy.

01:13:00.603 --> 01:13:04.772
That's what happens to monsters
who kill their mothers.

01:13:04.774 --> 01:13:05.640
- Joplin.

01:13:07.176 --> 01:13:10.979
Thank you, universe,
for your bounty, beauty,

01:13:10.981 --> 01:13:12.581
and your love.

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:15.751
- That was really good.

01:13:15.753 --> 01:13:16.652
Very nice.

01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:19.822
So tell me, what's her deal?

01:13:19.824 --> 01:13:21.023
- What's her deal?

01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:22.157
- What, is that?

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:23.337
Is that a bad question?

01:13:23.518 --> 01:13:23.904
- A little bit.

01:13:24.104 --> 01:13:26.161
I'm just trying
to get to know the girl.

01:13:26.163 --> 01:13:27.530
- The girl?

01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:28.731
Now, you're really
putting your foot in it.

01:13:28.733 --> 01:13:30.066
She's a woman.
- It's fine.

01:13:30.068 --> 01:13:31.835
- Oh my god, okay.

01:13:31.837 --> 01:13:33.136
The woman, I'm sorry.

01:13:33.138 --> 01:13:35.205
The last time I saw
him, he was like,

01:13:35.207 --> 01:13:38.107
"listen, man, I'm
gonna become a monk,"

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:41.544
so now, you're here, and
my curiosity is peaked.

01:13:41.546 --> 01:13:43.113
- Summer, lay off.

01:13:44.816 --> 01:13:46.050
Lay off.

01:13:46.052 --> 01:13:48.052
Oh my,
lay off of what?

01:13:48.054 --> 01:13:50.221
I'm just talking to, I'm
trying to get to know her?

01:13:50.223 --> 01:13:51.489
- What information?

01:13:51.491 --> 01:13:53.891
- I don't know, the basics.

01:13:53.893 --> 01:13:57.127
- Just basics.
- - She's an actress.

01:13:57.129 --> 01:13:58.028
- Really?

01:14:00.766 --> 01:14:01.666
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:02.768 --> 01:14:04.870
Summer used
to be an actress.

01:14:04.872 --> 01:14:05.871
- It was another lifetime.

01:14:05.873 --> 01:14:06.905
I was really bad.

01:14:06.907 --> 01:14:07.906
- So.

01:14:07.908 --> 01:14:09.207
Acting is acting.

01:14:09.209 --> 01:14:10.558
She used to Shakespeare
and everything.

01:14:10.683 --> 01:14:11.372
She's really good.

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:14.213
Thank you, and you are next,
if you don't eat your food.

01:14:14.215 --> 01:14:16.649
I'm sorry, that was sweet.

01:14:18.652 --> 01:14:19.785
So, do you like it?

01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:20.686
Acting?

01:14:21.755 --> 01:14:22.922
- Uh, I don't.

01:14:22.924 --> 01:14:24.090
Yeah, I guess.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.825
- Yeah?

01:14:25.827 --> 01:14:27.960
You must be really brave?

01:14:28.762 --> 01:14:31.164
- No, I'm not brave.

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.666
- No, I think so.

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:38.035
- Anybody want more wine?

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:39.872
- Yeah, I'll get it.

01:14:40.072 --> 01:14:41.174
No, no,
no, I'll get it.

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:42.643
I'll get it.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.577
- No, no, it's fine.
- - You sure?

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.579
- Out back, on the cooler.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.266
- Do you ever feel like a whore?

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.226
- Are you okay?

01:15:30.228 --> 01:15:31.328
- Huh? Yeah.

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:34.265
Let me
see. Let me see.

01:15:34.267 --> 01:15:35.299
What happened?

01:15:40.339 --> 01:15:42.239
Does it really hurt?

01:15:42.241 --> 01:15:43.208
- I don't know.
It's nothing.

01:15:43.242 --> 01:15:45.743
I think there was just
some broken glass.

01:15:45.745 --> 01:15:47.278
- Here.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.250
- Thanks.
Does it hurt?

01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:50.682
I'm gonna put some
pressure on it.

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:51.917
No, no,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:15:51.919 --> 01:15:54.119
I feel like
I'm not showing you

01:15:54.121 --> 01:15:55.187
a good time.

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:04.763
I really wasn't expecting
to like you this much.

01:16:08.335 --> 01:16:10.803
You know, when we first
met, when I gave you a lift,

01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:12.238
I thought you were a
snob, but for some reason,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.141
I just kept thinking about you.

01:16:15.143 --> 01:16:17.877
Then you came into the bar, and,

01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:21.682
I was glad.

01:16:24.753 --> 01:16:27.388
And, I think you're
really great.

01:16:29.157 --> 01:16:31.291
I think you're soft, and,

01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:34.161
sweet.

01:16:39.168 --> 01:16:43.271
I feel like you really
understand me, or something.

01:16:43.273 --> 01:16:45.840
I feel like I could want that.

01:16:50.312 --> 01:16:52.491
You're just a really
special person, Beth.

01:18:27.283 --> 01:18:30.152
You pretend to
be so fucking helpless,

01:18:30.154 --> 01:18:32.420
but you're actually
a fucking liar.

01:18:32.422 --> 01:18:34.289
What do
you want from me?

01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:35.957
I bet you think
you're better than me, huh?

01:18:35.959 --> 01:18:37.292
But you're not.

01:18:38.094 --> 01:18:39.758
- Please, please.
You're so obsessed.

01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:42.106
And your are a horrible
fucking creep.

01:18:42.399 --> 01:18:43.799
Tell me what
you want from me,

01:18:43.801 --> 01:18:44.801
and I will pay it!

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.836
I don't know what you want!

01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:48.171
- That's right, cry.

01:18:48.173 --> 01:18:50.273
Cry, you fucking bitch.

01:18:50.275 --> 01:18:52.508
Fake fucking crocodile tears

01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:55.578
from your fake fucking
Hollywood cunt.
