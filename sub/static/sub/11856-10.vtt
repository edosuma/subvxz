WEBVTT

00:10.458 --> 00:12.917
Mrs. Edino, I'm gonna put
in an extra side

00:13.000 --> 00:14.250
of roasted peppers for you.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.917
Oh, Ricardo made them?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.750
She won't eat
my peppers anymore.

00:18.834 --> 00:20.834
Even if they're free.
Has to be you made them.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.583
Sorry, Frank.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.250
Oh, there you are.

00:28.333 --> 00:29.583
Hey, dad.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.750
Tommy, see if there's
any meat sauce.

00:31.834 --> 00:33.250
The spicy stuff.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.500
Okay.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.625
I tell you about the night
classes Tommy's taking?

00:37.709 --> 00:39.417
Computers at the junior college.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.625
Kid's just in high school,
but he's thinking ahead.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.959
College level classes.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.875
Oh, he's a smart boy.

00:45.959 --> 00:48.667
Frank, my daughter
has a friend you'll
like.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.542
A divorcee, but very slender.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.333
- I'm real busy now.
- Oh.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.959
Lydia, God rest her soul,
has been gone over a year.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.208
'It's time, Frank.'

00:57.291 --> 00:59.000
You need a wife.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.625
Have a good day, ladies.

01:00.709 --> 01:01.959
Aah!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.792
Hey, why not go on a date?

01:05.875 --> 01:07.875
I'm busy, that's why.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.792
Hey, there you go, King.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.333
That dog is the wife.

01:14.417 --> 01:16.917
Hey, can it, you two.

02:08.959 --> 02:11.000
Heard a rumor Kat
Miller
from Narcotics

02:11.083 --> 02:12.834
is coming to Homicide.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.417
- Where'd you hear that?
- I got sources.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.500
Detectives.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.917
Gabby Weiss, public defender's.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.959
Remember me?

02:21.041 --> 02:23.458
Oh, the Lopez
case.
Sure.

02:23.542 --> 02:25.875
This is Paulo Munoz.

02:25.959 --> 02:28.542
- Lilly Rush.
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

02:28.625 --> 02:30.542
Scott Valens.
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

02:30.625 --> 02:32.291
Paulo's brother Ricardo
was convicted

02:32.375 --> 02:35.208
of robbing and killing
his boss back in 2001.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.500
I represented him.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.792
But Ricardo,
he did not do this crime.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.000
That is why I come here.
To help.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.500
Trial was four years ago.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.000
It took Paulo that long
to get through

02:44.083 --> 02:46.417
the post 9/11 customs maze.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.750
Where are you from, Paulo?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.417
El Salvador.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.500
Ricardo has money
when the police come

02:51.583 --> 02:52.625
so they say he robs.

02:52.709 --> 02:54.000
Where'd he get that cash?

02:54.083 --> 02:56.208
He lives with six
men
in a basement.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.375
So he holds his money
on his body.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.625
No other place is safe.

03:01.709 --> 03:04.458
Ricardo sent me a
letter,
before Frank dies.

03:04.542 --> 03:07.458
- Says Frank is scared.
- Scared of what?

03:07.542 --> 03:09.750
He didn't have it at trial,
but Ricardo always said

03:09.834 --> 03:11.542
that someone broke
into Frank's apartment

03:11.625 --> 03:12.750
before he was killed.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.875
You follow up on it?

03:14.959 --> 03:16.291
No.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.500
The thing is I was hoping
you could take this over.

03:19.583 --> 03:23.208
It's our job to put people
in jail, not get them out.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.792
Ricardo was
my first murder case.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.458
I was overwhelmed
and I really think I failed
him.

03:27.542 --> 03:31.625
He deserves more this time,
more than I can give him.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.000
What's he asking?

03:36.083 --> 03:37.166
If I got brothers.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.500
Yeah, I do.

03:40.917 --> 03:42.041
Paulo, the detectives are busy--

03:42.125 --> 03:45.959
I know Ricardo inside.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.667
Same as you know your brothers.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.542
He is innocent.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.583
'Can you help me?'

03:53.667 --> 03:55.917
Help my brother.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.000
We can try.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.250
- What is this?
- Could he be alone?

04:55.333 --> 04:56.375
Hey.

04:56.458 --> 04:59.291
This baby belong to anybody?

05:02.625 --> 05:05.000
Maybe someone went inside
for a minute. I mean..

05:05.083 --> 05:08.542
Who leaves a baby sitting alone?

05:08.625 --> 05:10.750
Let's talk to the desk.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.041
- Hey, Dubitsky.
- Yeah.

05:20.125 --> 05:24.000
Some idiot left their kid
just outside the entrance.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.417
Yeah, main elevator's broke.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.709
Maybe they didn't wanna lug
it
up the stairs.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.917
"It"?
You mean the baby?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.583
Just keep an eye on him until
whoever parked him comes back.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.083
Oh, no, no. Don't, don't make
me
the chump.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.333
Look, I'm sure
you'll handle it just fine.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.417
(Vera)
'And when they show up,
you tell 'em they're lucky'

05:40.500 --> 05:42.583
we didn't call DHS.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.959
Frank Dicenzio, 49.

05:51.041 --> 05:52.917
Owned the deli
where Ricardo Munoz worked.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.834
Cause of death,
blunt force
trauma.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.709
Some kind of adhesive residue
in the wounds.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.875
Weapon was a long, flat
object,
never recovered.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.625
Ricardo Munoz had no alibi,
had access to the deli

06:03.709 --> 06:05.542
and $1,000 on him
when the police found him.

06:05.625 --> 06:06.959
About the same amount
they figured

06:07.041 --> 06:08.208
was missing from the till.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.041
The guy couldn't get
a bank account.

06:10.125 --> 06:11.500
Lived with six guys
in tight quarters

06:11.583 --> 06:13.166
so he kept the cash on him.

06:13.250 --> 06:16.875
He sent it to his wife
and kids every month.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.166
It's the same as my granddad.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.583
The letter's in Spanish.

06:20.667 --> 06:21.959
It says there was
some kinda
break-in

06:22.041 --> 06:23.208
at Frank's apartment.

06:23.291 --> 06:24.792
Ricardo thought Frank
was in danger.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.625
Frank report this break-in?

06:26.709 --> 06:29.750
Uh, no. Not sure why.
Maybe Ricardo can tell us.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.000
You think Ricardo
was railroaded, Scotty?

06:32.083 --> 06:35.917
When you take away the
robbery aspect, motive's weak.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.458
Frank was his meal ticket.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.667
Look, an illegal immigrant,
alone, no money.

06:41.750 --> 06:45.250
I just thought we could give
it another look.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.625
Let's see if we can get
some traction

06:46.709 --> 06:48.709
on this new information.
The break-in at Frank's.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.792
We'll talk to Ricardo
up in Graterford.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.166
Gonna need something solid
on this, Scotty, to keep
going.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.125
Of course.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.458
New detective comin' in today.

06:55.542 --> 06:58.542
Kat Miller from Narcotics.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.333
How'd you meet Frank?

07:13.417 --> 07:15.208
I came here because
I heard there's more
jobs

07:15.291 --> 07:17.250
than New York.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.875
But for months, nothing.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.709
Then, I saw a help sign
in Frank's deli window.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.083
And how'd you two get along?

07:23.166 --> 07:26.750
First he was a good boss,
then he was a good friend.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.625
Never any fights
between the two of you?

07:28.709 --> 07:30.041
Never.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.959
He always helped me,
always listened to
me.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.500
Why would I kill Frank?

07:35.583 --> 07:38.291
Your letter said
Frank had a break-in.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.333
Right before he died.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.041
It was not just a break-in.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.542
It was an attack.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.041
'I told police,
but no one cared about it.'

07:45.125 --> 07:47.333
An attack?
On who?

07:47.417 --> 07:49.500
It was two weeks
before he died.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.834
(Frank)
Ah, made too much food.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.709
I thought with the holidays
comin' up, we'd be busier.

08:07.792 --> 08:10.041
Tomorrow,
there will be more
people.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.291
Your pasta
salad
is bad, boss.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.709
Too much garlic.

08:13.792 --> 08:16.208
What you don't know
about pasta salad is a lot.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.208
King sleeps like an old man.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.875
Uh, you wanna stay.

08:35.959 --> 08:38.500
- Have some dinner?
- I see you all day.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.500
Come on, sit down.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.667
Tommy's in school at night.
It'd be nice to have company.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.875
How's the family?
You called 'em today, right?

08:47.959 --> 08:50.250
My daughter is angry
with me now.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.917
Because I am so far away.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.208
She's too young to understand
that everything that we do

08:55.291 --> 08:57.083
is for our kids.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.625
King.

09:05.709 --> 09:06.792
King.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.667
You here, buddy?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.083
King?

09:12.166 --> 09:13.583
<i>Dios mio.</i>

09:14.417 --> 09:17.208
Oh, my God.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.291
What the hell happened to you?

09:19.375 --> 09:21.375
Frank, he needs a hospital.

09:21.458 --> 09:22.792
Yeah.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.542
Yeah, there's a vet on
the Boulevard, open all
night.

09:27.125 --> 09:30.458
Who...who would have done this?

09:30.542 --> 09:31.875
Let me help you, okay?

09:31.959 --> 09:33.166
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.583
Alright, King.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.458
'That's good, buddy.'

09:37.875 --> 09:41.333
When I tell them,
the police say it's just a
dog.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.583
But Frank thought
it was someone
trying

09:42.667 --> 09:45.000
to mess with him, scare him.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.625
Did he have any idea who?

09:46.709 --> 09:48.166
He said he didn't know.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.375
Why didn't Frank report it?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.750
Nothing was broken,
nothing gone.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.667
And the door was locked.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.834
So it wasn't really a break-in.

09:56.917 --> 09:59.250
Someone had a key.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.333
What about his son, Tommy?

10:01.417 --> 10:04.458
Frank said somebody else
got a key, somehow.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.166
And what'd you think?

10:07.250 --> 10:09.667
Tommy was the only one
I knew with a key.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.709
What makes you so sure this was
connected to Frank's death?

10:12.792 --> 10:15.333
Two bodies in two weeks?

10:15.417 --> 10:17.083
Beaten and beaten.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.750
Like someone cannot stop.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.959
My dad was like
the mayor of Oxford Circle.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.875
Everybody loved the guy.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.834
You surprised when
Ricardo was
arrested?

10:35.917 --> 10:37.417
At first, yeah.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.083
My dad was always good to him.

10:40.166 --> 10:43.208
It makes me sick just
thinking
about that lowlife.

10:43.291 --> 10:46.083
Why you guys asking?

10:46.166 --> 10:48.500
We're maybe reopening the case.

10:48.583 --> 10:52.208
(Jeffries)
'See anything
the night your father died?'

10:52.291 --> 10:54.667
No.
I had a junior college
class.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.834
'Supposed to help me
get an edge, career wise.'

10:56.917 --> 10:59.625
[scoffs]
See how much good that did me.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.250
We heard someone got
into the apartment

11:01.333 --> 11:03.250
two weeks before your dad died.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.834
Beat the dog up pretty bad.

11:04.917 --> 11:07.333
That's got nothing to do
with what happened to my dad.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.375
- 'Trust me.'
- How do you know that?

11:09.458 --> 11:12.166
- I know, okay?
- How, Tommy?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.709
Thank, God
for the all night vet.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.291
The cat went out
onto our balcony

11:17.375 --> 11:19.125
and PS, we're
on the third
floor

11:19.208 --> 11:21.792
so I figure,
she's not gonna
jump.

11:21.875 --> 11:26.125
- The cat jumped?
- Worse, she fell.

11:26.208 --> 11:30.250
How stupid does a cat have
to be for that?

11:30.333 --> 11:31.959
What happened to yours?

11:32.041 --> 11:34.750
I think somebody got
into our apartment.

11:34.834 --> 11:35.792
Went after King.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.583
- They hit the dog?
- Bad.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.417
'The vet's operating
on him now.'

11:40.500 --> 11:43.208
Oh my, God,
I'm so
sorry.

11:43.291 --> 11:44.625
Dad.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.458
What happened?

11:46.542 --> 11:48.250
King's in pretty bad
shape,
Tommy.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.583
It could be a while
till we hear
anything.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.542
- I can stay.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.166
[sighs]
Why is Stump even here?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.417
I thought you said we were
gonna
hang after you saw your dad.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.792
He said King's
in pretty bad shape.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.458
Come on, that mutt got
what it deserved.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.917
What did you just say?

12:04.000 --> 12:08.583
Nothin', Mr. Dicenzio.
It's all good.

12:08.667 --> 12:12.166
You stay the hell away
from my son and my dog.

12:13.417 --> 12:14.750
I told you.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.625
I don't want you hanging
around
with this punk.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.250
You understand?

12:24.458 --> 12:25.709
Wuss.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.667
I haven't talked
to Stump in years.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.709
Can see why.
Guy sounds a little psycho.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.166
My dad always hated him.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.959
You know, said his mom
was a druggie

12:40.041 --> 12:41.375
whole family was trouble.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.500
Sounds like Frank
thought
Stump beat the dog.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.166
Yeah, he did.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.458
The worst part is,
he could have been right.

12:47.542 --> 12:50.667
How'd Stump get
into the
apartment?

12:50.750 --> 12:53.041
I didn't have a lot
of friends after my mom died.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.834
Stump was it.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.750
I gave him a set of keys
so he'd have a place

12:57.834 --> 12:59.875
to hang out afternoons.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.458
To do what?

13:01.542 --> 13:02.500
He had girlfriends.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.291
And your father always worked.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.834
Look, Stump was
a messed up dude, okay

13:06.917 --> 13:09.000
and yeah, he might have
hit the dog.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.041
But there's no way in hell
he'd hurt my dad.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.583
He wouldn't do that.
He was my friend.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.500
So this kid Stump
beat up the dog.

13:22.583 --> 13:23.875
Well, sounds like it.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.709
But Tommy was real
insistent
Stump didn't kill Frank.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.125
A little too insistent.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.125
If Stump did it,
Tommy'd feel responsible.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.375
It'd be tough to face.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.208
Nick "Stump" Fanelli's
just outta jail.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.125
Got a rap sheet
a mile long.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.709
Beat a neighbor
with a baseball bat.

13:40.792 --> 13:41.959
Whole list of other assaults

13:42.041 --> 13:45.834
dating back to December, 2001.

13:45.917 --> 13:48.166
Right after Frank's murder.

13:58.291 --> 14:01.208
Detective, I'm heading out.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.375
No one claimed this kid.

14:02.458 --> 14:04.291
What? How's that possible?

14:04.375 --> 14:07.083
Maybe because there's
so much good in the world.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.667
Nanette from Records
put this bag together.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.125
- Said to give it to you.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:12.208 --> 14:15.041
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hey.

14:15.125 --> 14:19.417
I'm gonna call DHS right now.
Right now.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.083
Detective Vera.
Hey. Kat Miller.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.250
- Yeah, real busy.
- Oh.

14:23.333 --> 14:27.041
- Busy, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:27.125 --> 14:29.166
Cute kid you got.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.291
How are you, lieutenant?

14:37.375 --> 14:39.542
Detective Miller, welcome.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.959
The dress code's a step up
from Narcotics.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.250
Guess I better shop.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.834
Well, the clothes
are more expensive

14:44.917 --> 14:46.750
but the pay's the same.
Welcome to Homicide.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.959
On the plus side,
there are the dead bodies.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.250
And the long hours.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.875
I hope you cleared
your social
calendar.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.667
I just got this thing I do
Wednesdays at seven o'clock.

14:56.750 --> 14:59.375
- Okay.
- Can't miss it.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.125
Fair enough.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.834
Find a pigeonhole and fill
this
out and we'll get you going.

15:04.917 --> 15:08.041
It's biographical info
for personal records.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.917
I'm real glad to be here,
lieutenant. Thanks.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.041
Hey, I've been straight since
I got out of jail.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.166
The whole two weeks,
huh, Stump?

15:40.250 --> 15:43.041
Come on. What'd I do
to deserve a visit, hmm?

15:43.125 --> 15:47.333
Remember a buddy of yours,
Tommy Dicenzio?

15:47.417 --> 15:50.500
Yeah, of course. We met in a
computer class for JC retards.

15:50.583 --> 15:55.000
You remember the family
dog,
big mutt, wouldn't hurt a
fly.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.834
Somebody beat him up
pretty bad back then.

15:57.917 --> 16:00.542
Heard maybe it was you.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.625
You here to ask me about a dog?
What, you the canine police?

16:03.709 --> 16:06.750
Hmm. Where were you the night
Frank Dicenzio was killed?

16:06.834 --> 16:09.709
Whoa! I-I was at class.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.208
You check it out
and you'll see yourself.

16:12.291 --> 16:15.458
And look, even if I did hit
that dog I didn't kill Frank.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.792
That Spanish guy,
he's upstate for that.

16:19.542 --> 16:22.166
We're taking another
look
at the case.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.709
If the guy didn't do it
with his own hands

16:23.792 --> 16:25.375
don't mean
he wasn't responsible.

16:25.458 --> 16:28.333
What are you talking about?

16:28.417 --> 16:30.542
Ricardo, he brought some
serious trouble into that
deli.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.667
I saw it myself.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.583
Where's Ricardo, chummy?

16:43.667 --> 16:44.834
He ain't here, Felix

16:44.917 --> 16:47.000
and he said he's going
to pay you, so lay off.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.625
Due date's long past.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.208
And I have to keep strict
rules
about that, you know.

16:53.166 --> 16:54.750
Give the guy a break.

16:54.834 --> 16:57.083
He's just trying
to bring his family here.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.834
I'm a businessman, like you.

16:59.917 --> 17:03.250
My business is Felix's Best.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.709
Ricardo pays me soon,
or I start giving out
penalties.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.959
That's how I keep
my business
running.

17:09.041 --> 17:11.625
Yeah. And I call the cops

17:11.709 --> 17:13.458
and I tell them what you do
to these people.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.166
No, you won't.

17:15.250 --> 17:19.667
'Cause they will just pull
Ricardo back to El
Salvador.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.083
You're just a lowlife scum

17:21.166 --> 17:22.750
preying on
other people's predicaments.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.583
Oh, that's very
insulting,
Frank.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.041
I heard what you did
to Ricardo's roommate.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.792
Knocking out his teeth,
breaking his jaw.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.125
You're a sick bastard.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.250
I don't get my money,
there's two of you

17:34.333 --> 17:36.458
I'm gonna take care of now.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.625
Now, who was this guy Felix?

17:50.709 --> 17:51.875
(Stump)
'I've never seen him before'

17:51.959 --> 17:53.750
but he was a badass,
I'll tell you that.

17:53.834 --> 17:54.875
You tell anyone about it?

17:54.959 --> 17:57.458
Nah. Frank, he was on my case

17:57.542 --> 17:59.625
all the time back then, so I..

17:59.709 --> 18:03.959
...I figured he deserved
a little heat coming his way.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.166
Okay, Stump, we'll be in touch.

18:08.917 --> 18:13.542
Well, I'll be right here
'cause where else am I gonna
go?

18:21.917 --> 18:23.375
Stump's alibi clear?

18:23.458 --> 18:25.083
Yep. Checked attendance records

18:25.166 --> 18:27.750
both he and Tommy were in class
the night Frank was killed.

18:27.834 --> 18:31.250
Ricardo was borrowing money
from this Felix guy. Loan
shark?

18:31.333 --> 18:32.500
<i>Prestamista.</i>

18:32.583 --> 18:35.166
They help illegals
in the Latin community

18:35.250 --> 18:36.500
'by giving out loans.'

18:36.583 --> 18:37.875
Some of them deal, too.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.166
Bad ones play by intimidation
and violence.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.500
You able to
track
this guy down?

18:41.583 --> 18:43.583
I made some calls,
couldn't get a hit.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.500
The name Felix is kind
of common, I guess.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.709
(Kat)
'Maybe reach out
in the neighborhood'

18:46.792 --> 18:48.208
'where Ricardo lived.'

18:48.291 --> 18:49.875
Paulo could help with that.
He's staying there.

18:49.959 --> 18:53.083
Good. Get him
to take you
around.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.709
- Hey.
- I was thinking I should
stay.

18:55.792 --> 18:58.875
Keep an eye on the kid
till DHS gets here.

18:58.959 --> 19:00.208
Last time I handed him off

19:00.291 --> 19:02.875
Dubitsky gives him a stapler
to play with.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.667
You wanna hit Francisville?

19:04.750 --> 19:07.166
- Let's do it.
- Alright.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.750
Hey.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.083
The Bembe.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.291
I busted this place once.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.709
Ricardo's old
neighbor
will be here.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.625
I might run into some
old neighbors of my own.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.625
Where's your family from?

19:32.709 --> 19:34.709
Dad's Cuban.
Mom's Puerto Rican.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.583
Grew up about a half a mile
from here.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.583
Your family must be
proud
of you.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.834
I guess so, yeah.

19:52.375 --> 19:53.417
(Paulo)
<i>'Alla.'</i>

19:53.500 --> 19:55.250
Felix.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.417
You Felix Darosa?

20:02.208 --> 20:03.542
Yeah.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.250
I got a few questions
for you.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.458
You guys aren't so good
for business, you know.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.875
So talk fast.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.667
You know a Ricardo Munoz?

20:11.750 --> 20:14.125
Ricardo...Munoz?

20:14.208 --> 20:16.875
Got put away for murdering
his boss, Frank Dicenzio.

20:16.959 --> 20:17.959
Owed you some money.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.125
I like to help sometimes
when I can

20:20.208 --> 20:23.709
enrich my community
to the best of my ability.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.709
Thing is, Felix,
we heard Frank's the
one

20:25.792 --> 20:26.834
who tried to help Ricardo out.

20:26.917 --> 20:28.208
And you weren't happy.

20:28.291 --> 20:29.959
Said you'd have to take
care
of two people.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.667
(Kat)
'Ricardo's in jail,
Frank's dead.'

20:31.750 --> 20:33.959
That's two people
taken care of.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.125
Frank wasn't a problem to me.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.625
Him and Ricardo busted up.
A bad divorce.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.083
And how do you know that?

20:41.166 --> 20:44.291
'Cause I saw it
with my own two eyes.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.542
<i>Por favor.</i>

21:06.250 --> 21:07.667
Frankie.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.375
You forgot your keys

21:09.458 --> 21:11.625
and you're supposed
to open up tomorrow.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.667
Everything okay, Frank?

21:15.750 --> 21:16.750
I just saw you have the key

21:16.834 --> 21:18.834
to my apartment
on your key ring.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.500
Where'd you get this?

21:20.583 --> 21:22.834
You give it to me
when I start the
job.

21:22.917 --> 21:25.417
No. I gave you the key
to the deli.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.458
I never gave you
the key to my home.

21:27.542 --> 21:30.750
Then I don't know
how it gets there.

21:30.834 --> 21:35.083
You took a long break
that day King got beat up.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.625
You go into my apartment,
Ricardo?

21:36.709 --> 21:37.959
No!

21:38.041 --> 21:39.458
I was with you
when we found him!

21:39.542 --> 21:41.000
But you were itching
to get out of there

21:41.083 --> 21:42.667
as soon as we came in.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.000
And you were always saying
how I should leave the dog

21:45.083 --> 21:46.291
at home, he gets in the way--

21:46.375 --> 21:50.125
Get out of here,
Frank.
This is crazy!

21:50.208 --> 21:52.500
We're done, Ricardo.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.709
- You're fired.
- What?

21:54.792 --> 21:57.583
I don't know
who the hell you are.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.333
He fired Ricardo?

22:10.417 --> 22:11.959
That's right.

22:13.583 --> 22:14.875
Ricardo say anything to you

22:15.000 --> 22:17.709
about where he got
the key to Frank's place?

22:17.792 --> 22:19.625
Nothing.

22:19.709 --> 22:21.709
But two days later,
he paid me back.

22:21.792 --> 22:23.208
The whole loan.

22:23.291 --> 22:26.083
So I got no reason
to bother anybody, you see?

22:26.166 --> 22:28.500
All worked out good for me.

22:30.041 --> 22:33.250
Sounds like Ricardo
left out a major detail.

22:33.333 --> 22:36.083
Did you know they fought,
that Ricardo was fired?

22:36.166 --> 22:37.417
No.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.125
This is the only way I could
get
this whack-job to go to sleep.

22:59.875 --> 23:02.625
Well, he's sleeping
pretty sound now.

23:02.709 --> 23:04.709
You should've seen it.

23:04.792 --> 23:07.875
The later it got,
the more energy he had.

23:07.959 --> 23:09.458
It was nuts.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.417
Remember Lindsey,
Child Services.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.625
Sure.
Hey, Lindsey.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.291
Sorry we couldn't
send anybody last night.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.041
We had a group-home crisis.

23:19.125 --> 23:21.208
But they found the mom.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.291
So where's she been
for the last 24 hours?

23:24.375 --> 23:26.792
She had a double-shift at
work,
the sitter canceled

23:26.875 --> 23:28.333
her brother got the baby.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.750
Guess he's troubled.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.625
Dumped him on the way
to a court appointment.

23:31.709 --> 23:34.166
She gave her son to a head case?

23:34.250 --> 23:37.125
Well, we'll investigate,
make sure the home is okay.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.041
Hope so.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.417
Here.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.166
It seems like you
got a knack for that stuff.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.250
Nah, one night and I'm fried.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.250
I'm glad Julie
and I never had kids.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.542
You didn't tell me
Frank fired you, Ricardo.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.792
I-it was not important.
He took me back the next day.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.750
How about owing money
to Felix Darosa

24:18.834 --> 24:22.375
and him pushing Frank around.
That not important either?

24:22.458 --> 24:25.834
Frank talked to Felix?
I didn't know.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.458
What else did you leave out,
that might make you look bad?

24:28.542 --> 24:29.583
Nothing.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.041
Where'd you get the key
to Frank's house?

24:31.125 --> 24:32.458
I didn't know
that key was there.

24:32.542 --> 24:33.667
'But you got pretty angry'

24:33.750 --> 24:36.125
when Frank started
asking about it.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.333
Felix was threatening me
about money

24:38.417 --> 24:40.125
and then Frank comes accuses me.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.417
I work hard every day,
day after day

24:42.500 --> 24:44.417
and it's never enough.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.709
Is that why you snapped
and killed Frank?

24:46.792 --> 24:49.083
No! Frank took me back,
I told you.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.875
Well, how'd you get
the money to pay
Felix?

24:50.959 --> 24:52.709
Frank loaned it to me.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.875
You got proof of that?

24:58.208 --> 24:59.458
No.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.166
And I come all the
way
out here again.

25:06.625 --> 25:08.458
You're just playing me,
ain't you?

25:08.542 --> 25:09.792
Wait.

25:09.875 --> 25:10.959
'Detective Valens.'

25:11.041 --> 25:12.250
Open up.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.083
<i>Por favor.</i>

25:14.166 --> 25:15.917
The key.
I promise
you

25:16.000 --> 25:17.583
I didn't put it there.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.667
And Frank didn't.

25:19.750 --> 25:22.083
Only one other person
could have.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.792
Tommy?

25:33.250 --> 25:35.709
(Rush)
'Hey, Tommy.
Couple questions popped up.'

25:35.792 --> 25:36.834
We thought
you could help.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.208
We found out
there was a
key

25:38.291 --> 25:40.000
on Ricardo's key
ring
to your apartment.

25:40.083 --> 25:43.083
Any thoughts
on how it got there?

25:43.166 --> 25:44.458
Yeah.

25:45.542 --> 25:48.000
I put it there.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.625
All these years,
I thought Ricardo

25:49.709 --> 25:51.291
was the one who killed my dad.

25:51.375 --> 25:54.250
You know, I wouldn't have done
anything to help the guy.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.500
But now you're saying
that he didn't do it.

25:56.583 --> 25:57.667
Why'd you put the key
there, Tommy?

25:57.750 --> 25:59.041
It was when
my dad was still

25:59.125 --> 26:00.500
obsessing over
who got in and hit the dog.

26:00.583 --> 26:01.792
And you knew it was Stump.

26:01.875 --> 26:03.375
So you were
protecting your friend?

26:03.458 --> 26:07.458
It's not just that. I was
trying
to get Ricardo fired. I
mean..

26:07.542 --> 26:09.000
'...he was taking
advantage of my dad.'

26:09.083 --> 26:11.625
So you were watching out
for your dad?

26:11.709 --> 26:13.834
Nobody else was going to.

26:15.542 --> 26:19.166
Not easy,
losing a parent.

26:19.250 --> 26:22.500
Trying to take care of
the one you got left.

26:22.583 --> 26:25.333
After my mom died,
it was like

26:25.417 --> 26:27.583
he lost all his common sense
or something.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.542
'I mean, the people
he picked..'

26:29.625 --> 26:30.583
Friends?

26:30.667 --> 26:31.583
Sorta.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.500
Like who?

26:33.583 --> 26:36.625
There was this one lady.

26:36.709 --> 26:40.500
- It doesn't really matter.
- Well, let us decide that.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.750
I was a little concerned
about her.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.083
Tried to open his eyes.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.542
Been a while since
I went on a date.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.333
Should've bought a new suit.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.834
These pants got
a little too small.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.166
Nobody wears
suits
anymore.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.542
I wear suits.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.166
It's respectful.

27:04.709 --> 27:08.125
Hmm. Maybe just
a good sports jacket.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.792
I got a navy blue one
with nice buttons.

27:10.875 --> 27:14.208
See if it's in the closet?

27:14.291 --> 27:17.000
(Tommy)
'So you going out with that
lady
Mrs. Edino was talking about?'

27:17.083 --> 27:19.458
Nah, it's the one
I met at the vet.

27:19.542 --> 27:20.917
Antonia.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.041
Lives right around the corner.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.291
Her?

27:24.375 --> 27:27.041
- Yeah. You know her?
- Ain't she married?

27:27.125 --> 27:29.959
Every time I see her she's
with
this big bruiser-looking guy.

27:30.041 --> 27:33.542
- No, she's separated now.
- 'Must've just happened.'

27:33.625 --> 27:35.542
Pretty soon
to be
dating..

27:35.625 --> 27:37.041
...for both of you.

27:37.125 --> 27:40.125
Whoa! You're the one that said
I should go on a date.

27:40.208 --> 27:43.083
Yeah, but I didn't think
you'd do it.

27:43.166 --> 27:45.417
I mean, and this lady,
she's real..

27:45.500 --> 27:48.375
...loud and flashy.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.500
She's not like mom.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.917
No one's gonna be
like your mom.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.917
She was one in a billion.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.417
Listen..

28:01.500 --> 28:05.792
...I've been too wrapped up
in work since mom..

28:05.875 --> 28:08.291
...and I haven't been
home enough.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.291
I'm sorry about that.

28:12.083 --> 28:15.875
Maybe we could start
spending time..

28:15.959 --> 28:17.583
...together again

28:17.667 --> 28:19.583
like the old days.

28:21.583 --> 28:23.208
Yeah, we could do
that father-son

28:23.291 --> 28:25.000
hockey league
again, maybe.

28:25.083 --> 28:26.333
There you go.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.542
Just be careful, okay?

28:33.041 --> 28:35.291
Don't worry
about me, T.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.917
I'm fine.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.000
This Antonia,
the woman your dad met

28:45.083 --> 28:46.291
at the animal hospital?

28:46.375 --> 28:47.542
Yeah.

28:47.625 --> 28:49.291
What about this
bruiser ex of hers?

28:49.375 --> 28:52.333
- What was his story?
- He was some sort of loony.

28:52.417 --> 28:55.083
You know, he stalked her
after they split.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.125
They used to have these fights
in the streets.

28:57.208 --> 29:00.834
Antonia and your dad going out
that rile up the crazy ex?

29:00.917 --> 29:03.000
Something bad must've happened.

29:03.083 --> 29:05.959
He was home half an hour
after he left.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.917
Never said a word about it.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.458
When did Frank go on this date?

29:10.542 --> 29:12.709
Few days before he was killed.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
We asked around,
heard your ex-husband

29:26.083 --> 29:28.333
wasn't the nicest guy, Antonia.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.875
That's the understatement
of the century.

29:30.959 --> 29:32.709
What'd Ray do this time?

29:32.792 --> 29:34.250
Well, that's what we're here
to figure out.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.125
He have a problem
when you started dating?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.542
Gave me a hard time,
but he was the one

29:37.625 --> 29:39.000
that had two girlfriends
before I'd packed up

29:39.083 --> 29:41.208
my last suitcase.

29:41.291 --> 29:43.208
What's this about?

29:43.291 --> 29:45.667
You remember Frank DiCenzio?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Of course, I do.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.709
Do you think Ray might've

29:49.792 --> 29:51.166
had a beef with Frank

29:51.250 --> 29:53.000
considering
the two of you went out?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.542
Trust me, if Ray heard about
my date with Frank.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.500
- He would have loved it.
- Why's that?

29:57.583 --> 29:59.792
'Cause it was a total
friggin' disaster.

30:05.875 --> 30:08.041
You're sweet,
you know that?

30:13.667 --> 30:15.750
- So how's King doing?
- Better.

30:15.834 --> 30:17.250
Got home a couple of days ago.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.041
Bootsie's
doing
better too

30:19.125 --> 30:20.417
but she's
missing
all her front
teeth

30:20.500 --> 30:22.875
which PS is
not
a pretty
picture.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.333
Your son is Tommy, right?

30:28.417 --> 30:29.542
Yeah.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.875
Hard being a single parent, huh?

30:31.959 --> 30:35.125
Caitlin wears me down sometimes.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.166
My wife, she was
the one who knew

30:37.250 --> 30:38.458
how to talk to Tommy.

30:38.542 --> 30:41.875
I try, but I can't hold
the family together

30:41.959 --> 30:44.834
like she did.
I'm gonna do better.

30:44.917 --> 30:47.709
Teenagers could
be hard to handle.

30:49.166 --> 30:52.250
He had a tough time this year,
but he's a good kid.

30:54.458 --> 30:55.792
I think I should
tell you
something.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.375
- About his friend Stump.
- You know him?

30:58.458 --> 31:00.583
I take Caitlin to
skate
on Monday nights

31:00.667 --> 31:02.917
see him and Tommy
playing hockey.

31:03.000 --> 31:03.917
What?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.709
The thing is...that kid Stump

31:06.792 --> 31:08.000
races around the ice

31:08.083 --> 31:09.291
'bullies
the smaller kids.'

31:09.375 --> 31:12.000
Oh, you're mixin' 'em up
with somebody else.

31:12.083 --> 31:15.583
They got computer classes
on Monday.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.125
I'm sure, Frank.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.208
And I heard Stump stole money
from the snack stand

31:20.291 --> 31:21.583
and beat up the kid
who works there.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.458
Stump ain't that bad.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.625
Tommy wouldn't
put up with it.

31:26.709 --> 31:29.083
I'm sorry if I..

31:32.834 --> 31:34.792
Let's just forget it. It's
none
of my business, anyway.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.875
You're damn right
it's none of your business.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.291
Excuse me?

31:38.375 --> 31:41.792
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.917
I gotta get out of here.

31:49.709 --> 31:52.458
If my daughter was
acting up out of my sight

31:52.542 --> 31:53.959
I'd wanna hear about it.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.917
Some people don't, I guess.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.375
So you saw Stump
and Tommy every week?

31:58.458 --> 32:03.417
Yeah. Poor kids on the ice were
scared to death of that Stump.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.875
(Stillman)
'Rink on Mondays,
that means they could'

32:04.959 --> 32:06.333
sneak out of class somehow.

32:06.417 --> 32:08.750
There goes their alibi
for the night of Frank's
murder.

32:10.125 --> 32:12.000
If Stump killed Frank

32:12.083 --> 32:15.083
we think Tommy would
protect him all this
time?

32:15.166 --> 32:17.625
He would if he thought
his life depended on it.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.875
It must have felt pretty
good,
knocking off the snack shop

32:27.959 --> 32:28.959
beating that kid up.

32:29.041 --> 32:30.500
The snack shop?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.709
We took like 30 bucks.
It was no big deal.

32:33.792 --> 32:35.417
Oh, so maybe
you tried moving up

32:35.500 --> 32:36.834
stealing from the deli.

32:36.917 --> 32:38.667
You break in meaning just
to skim a little cash

32:38.750 --> 32:40.208
but things go wrong.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.959
'Maybe Frank walks in,
catches you?'

32:42.041 --> 32:45.458
Frank? I had nothing to do
with that, I told you.

32:45.542 --> 32:46.959
I was at class that night.

32:47.041 --> 32:49.500
No, Stump, you weren't. You
were
sneaking out playing hockey.

32:49.583 --> 32:52.208
(Jeffries)
'And residue on Frank's body
matches sports tape'

32:52.291 --> 32:53.667
kind you put on a hockey stick.

32:53.750 --> 32:56.500
This isn't right.
I've been getting on track.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.500
Well, your past
is catching up with you.

32:59.583 --> 33:02.250
It's not my past.
It's his.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.583
- His?
- Tommy's.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.208
From what we hear, Tommy
you

33:07.291 --> 33:10.333
Yeah, well, everybody thought
Tommy was the good guy

33:10.417 --> 33:12.834
but he had
a whole other side.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.417
After his mom died,
it was like a switch

33:14.500 --> 33:15.875
got flipped or something.

33:15.959 --> 33:20.375
- How's that?
- He could get crazy. Rage
fits.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.750
He's the one that beat up
the kid at the snack stand

33:22.834 --> 33:24.750
scared him into keepin'
his mouth shut.

33:24.834 --> 33:26.959
What about Frank?
Who did that?

33:28.166 --> 33:31.083
Stop protecting Tommy.
He's no friend of yours.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.917
What happened the night Frank
was killed, Stump?

33:37.041 --> 33:39.083
We snuck out of class.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.250
We were gonna have snacks
and beers from the deli

33:41.333 --> 33:43.542
and then play a little hockey.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.542
But things didn't go
like we planned.

33:57.041 --> 33:59.083
Oh, damn. Your dad's here.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.250
He can't hear us.

34:10.792 --> 34:14.291
(Frank)
I'm sorry about everything.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.500
'You've been nothing,
but good for this place.'

34:16.583 --> 34:19.625
I get real emotional
when it comes to
King.

34:19.709 --> 34:23.458
I got him with
Lydia,
you know?

34:23.542 --> 34:24.917
It's okay, Frank.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.125
You know, someday maybe..

34:27.208 --> 34:29.000
...we could be partners
in this deli.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.041
(Ricardo)
'You make a great deli, Frank.
I'm proud to work here.'

34:32.125 --> 34:35.834
(Frank)
I had big plans that this was
gonna be a family business.

34:35.917 --> 34:38.000
It's why I work so hard.

34:38.083 --> 34:41.959
'I thought that Tommy was gonna
be my partner one day'

34:42.041 --> 34:45.166
but now...I'm not so sure.

34:46.959 --> 34:50.625
I found something
out
from the vet.

34:50.709 --> 34:51.875
What?

34:51.959 --> 34:53.417
Forget it.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.834
It doesn't matter.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.834
(Ricardo)
'You are like family
to me, Frank.'

34:59.917 --> 35:02.083
is

35:02.166 --> 35:04.834
I feel the same way.

35:04.917 --> 35:09.000
Fact is, I feel closer
to you than my own kid.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.125
'Is that nuts or what?'

35:22.750 --> 35:24.208
Let's go.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.625
- 'So Tommy took the cash.'
- Yeah.

35:31.709 --> 35:34.709
What did Frank mean he found
something out from the vet?

35:34.792 --> 35:37.709
He probably found out
that Tommy beat that dog
up.

35:37.792 --> 35:41.625
When Tommy got mad, whoo!
It was like an explosion.

35:41.709 --> 35:45.166
I mean, you should've seen him
whalin' on that snack shop kid.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.166
What'd you two do
after you left the deli?

35:47.250 --> 35:49.083
We drank the beer.
Tommy didn't wanna play hockey.

35:49.166 --> 35:51.333
He just went home,
he's all worked up

35:51.417 --> 35:52.792
and I never saw Frank again.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.250
And you've been covering
for him ever since?

35:58.000 --> 36:01.083
I wasn't coverin' for him
because he was my friend.

36:01.166 --> 36:02.667
I was coverin' for him
because I didn't wanna

36:02.750 --> 36:04.917
end up like Frank.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.917
(Rush)
'We're hearing
some things, Tommy.'

36:16.000 --> 36:17.375
What things?

36:17.458 --> 36:19.375
Like you're the one
that beat up the family
pet.

36:19.458 --> 36:22.208
That's crazy.

36:22.291 --> 36:23.750
Actually,
it's pretty normal

36:23.834 --> 36:27.041
having all that
anger build up.

36:27.125 --> 36:29.750
- I wasn't angry.
- Yeah?

36:29.834 --> 36:32.750
Then you're a stronger kid
than I was.

36:32.834 --> 36:36.542
After my dad left, I was mad
all the time, mostly at my
mom.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.250
My dad tried his best.

36:38.333 --> 36:40.417
I don't know about that.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.917
What's that supposed to mean?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.417
(Rush)
'No, he's right, Tommy.'

36:43.500 --> 36:45.083
Frank took care of the deli.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.750
'He was real good
with Ricardo'

36:46.834 --> 36:48.125
but what about with you?

36:48.208 --> 36:50.625
- He tried.
- Come on.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.417
Your dad left you high and dry
after your mom died.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.583
Like all he cared about
was himself.

36:55.667 --> 36:59.083
No, he was just busy.
We both were.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.041
Too busy for his own son?

37:01.125 --> 37:03.166
Sounds to me like
he was a selfish little
man

37:03.250 --> 37:04.625
who couldn't take
care
of his own family.

37:04.709 --> 37:05.959
Hey, he was a great guy!

37:06.041 --> 37:07.875
The whole neighborhood
loved him!

37:07.959 --> 37:11.083
The measure of
a man is his
family.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.625
So your dad
was a failure.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.750
He wasn't a failure.
You didn't know him.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.667
But he abandoned you

37:17.750 --> 37:19.625
and you were just a kid.

37:19.709 --> 37:22.041
- He tried to help me.
- How?

37:22.125 --> 37:24.125
By ignoring you?

37:24.208 --> 37:25.500
If he loved you,
he'd pay attention

37:25.583 --> 37:27.041
even get up in your face
if he had to.

37:27.125 --> 37:29.208
That's what he did!
That's exactly what he did!

37:29.291 --> 37:31.291
So he confronted you?
Took you on.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.208
Yeah, see?
did

37:34.291 --> 37:36.417
That what got him killed?

37:40.333 --> 37:42.625
Grief can make
you crazy, Tommy.

37:43.709 --> 37:45.125
I know.

37:48.375 --> 37:50.417
But I'm the failure.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.333
Not dad.

37:54.959 --> 37:56.208
Me.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.709
Beer's gone.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.625
The whole register's empty.

38:10.709 --> 38:12.875
You must've known
I'd see that.

38:12.959 --> 38:15.041
It was Stump's idea.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.875
I told him not to.

38:16.959 --> 38:18.625
What about hockey
on Mondays?

38:18.709 --> 38:21.250
- That Stump's idea, too?
- What?

38:21.333 --> 38:23.458
I know you been sneaking
out of class, Tommy.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.750
One time. Maybe two.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.792
It's no big deal.

38:27.875 --> 38:29.834
And the vet called.

38:29.917 --> 38:31.458
Told me that King wouldn't
let you touch him

38:31.542 --> 38:33.375
the day that you visited.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.625
You beat him up. Didn't you?

38:35.709 --> 38:37.625
No, I didn't.

38:37.709 --> 38:40.875
- Stump did it.
- This is my fault.

38:40.959 --> 38:43.208
I've been a bad father.

38:43.291 --> 38:45.375
I didn't reach out
to you enough.

38:45.458 --> 38:49.375
- It's fine, dad.
- No, it's not fine.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.792
I think that there's
somethin'
wrong with you, Tommy.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.709
I lost my temper, okay?

38:55.792 --> 38:57.750
I made a sandwich and he grabbed
it right off the table.

38:57.834 --> 38:59.333
I didn't mean
to hurt him that bad.

38:59.417 --> 39:02.250
Jeez, Tommy, King was
almost dead when we found him.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.709
I lost my temper!
I told you!

39:06.667 --> 39:08.291
Look..

39:08.375 --> 39:09.875
...there's places
where they help kids

39:09.959 --> 39:11.792
with your kinda problems.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.959
You had a hard year.

39:15.041 --> 39:18.750
You wanna send me away
to a school for some
freaks?

39:18.834 --> 39:20.583
It's not for freaks.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.250
It's a place where you could
go
to get better.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.333
Then you could come home.

39:25.417 --> 39:29.041
We could work the deli
together.
Have a future.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.500
But I got Stump here.

39:30.583 --> 39:32.834
It'd be good for the two of
you
to separate for a while.

39:32.917 --> 39:34.917
- Trust me.
- No! That's not fair!

39:35.000 --> 39:36.500
You have everything.
You've got the deli.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.959
The dog, Ricardo!
I'm gonna have nothing!

39:40.041 --> 39:42.208
You got me.
And I got you.

39:42.291 --> 39:46.333
- No matter what, T.
- I don't care about that.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.458
You can't do this to me.
You can't.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.750
I'm not going away!

39:51.834 --> 39:54.750
You're my son.
You'll do as I say.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.667
No! I won't!
