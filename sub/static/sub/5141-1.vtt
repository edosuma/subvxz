The cute and fuzzy bunnies were quick to cooperate this time.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.178
The path they sent him on
landed him

10:14.265 --> 10:16.267
on an ocean-going vessel.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.747
Now, our hero hated boats

10:17.834 --> 10:19.967
but he was desperate
in his quest.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.534
And once again he fell
victim to the heinous

10:22.622 --> 10:24.014
cute and fuzzy bunnies.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.147
And he was sucked
into the cold, dark sea

10:26.234 --> 10:28.236
and he never found love.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.281
[whining]

10:30.368 --> 10:31.761
[bunnies laughing]

10:31.848 --> 10:33.720
[instrumental music]

10:43.164 --> 10:44.469
Are you alright?

10:44.556 --> 10:45.949
Me?

10:46.036 --> 10:47.342
Yeah, great.
Really good.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.083
Why?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.694
I don't know, you look
pretty uncomfortable.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.653
What, a-are you afraid of water?

10:54.958 --> 10:55.916
No.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.310
No, not really. No.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.530
Well, yeah.

11:01.617 --> 11:04.576
Yeah, actually,
I am afraid of the water.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.491
But, uh, this is a big boat.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.667
A lot of safety equipment.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.756
And I can see the land.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.322
[exhales]
Clean, fresh air.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.410
[inhales]

11:12.497 --> 11:13.673
[George]
Chili dog.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.112
Go away.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.810
[seagulls squawking]

11:20.897 --> 11:22.551
You live on the island?

11:22.638 --> 11:23.857
Just for the summer,
I'm going over

11:23.944 --> 11:25.206
to help my grandfather out.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.424
What kinda help?

11:26.511 --> 11:27.817
Well, he's got
a houseful of friends

11:27.904 --> 11:30.124
he's taking care of, and...

11:30.211 --> 11:31.516
He's having money problems.

11:31.603 --> 11:32.822
I was working in
some dive tryin' to

11:32.909 --> 11:34.868
help him out
but I got ripped off.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.391
Is that what that was about,
the big scene back there?

11:36.478 --> 11:37.609
- Yeah.
- Hm.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.046
I wish I could've helped out more.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.701
Oh, come on, you were great.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.442
[George]
You sure? Last bite.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.096
Will you get out
of here with this?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.842
Hey, you kids!

11:52.929 --> 11:54.801
[both screaming]

11:58.979 --> 12:00.850
[foghorn blowing]

12:02.417 --> 12:04.332

[instrumental music]

12:12.819 --> 12:14.864
[screaming]

12:14.951 --> 12:16.387
Come on!

12:16.474 --> 12:18.476
This gonna be,
this is gonna be fun.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.869
[chuckles]

12:21.741 --> 12:23.177
[Clay]
All the eggs, they're broken!

12:23.264 --> 12:24.918
Argh!

12:25.005 --> 12:27.659
Clay, I-if you're not gonna
stand on the right side

12:27.747 --> 12:29.139
you're like defeating
the entire purpose

12:29.226 --> 12:31.228
of even buying them,
you big mess!

12:34.231 --> 12:36.538
Mess! Argh!

12:36.625 --> 12:38.105
[music continues]

12:38.192 --> 12:40.324
There they are.
The Stork twins.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.065
[Hoops]
Those guys? They're twins?

12:42.152 --> 12:43.763
[George]
Yeah, Clay's a couple minutes older.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.938
Yo!

12:45.025 --> 12:46.504
The Stork twins!

12:46.591 --> 12:48.680
[screaming]

12:48.768 --> 12:50.204
This is Hoops.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.422
Aloha!

12:51.509 --> 12:53.076
Hi, Hoops!

12:53.163 --> 12:54.817
I'm gonna go get the car.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.427
Hey, Squidly!

13:01.476 --> 13:03.086
Hey, this is gonna be
a great shot.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.134
I'm out.
Maybe we'll see each other.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.222
- Hope so.
- Alright.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.833
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, you too.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.574
Hey, Stork guys!

13:12.661 --> 13:13.575
- Hi, Hoops.
- What's happening?

13:13.662 --> 13:14.924
- How do you do?
- Hi.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.970
I-it's very, it's very...

13:17.057 --> 13:18.275
[screaming]

13:18.362 --> 13:19.842
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.539
Me too.
What's going on here?

13:21.626 --> 13:22.802
What's with the big fish?

13:22.889 --> 13:24.151
Oh, they're shooting the sequel

13:24.238 --> 13:25.761
to that movie "Foam" here.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.719
Yeah, about, about
the giant dolphin

13:27.807 --> 13:29.547
with rabies that terrorizes

13:29.634 --> 13:31.201
a small New England town.

13:31.288 --> 13:32.289
Wow.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.421
We're gonna work part-time

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
as security guards on the set.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.904
- Stork twins!
- Argh!

13:37.991 --> 13:39.514
[both screaming]

13:39.601 --> 13:41.342
- Clay!
- O-ow.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.647
So, what, you guys got
the day off

13:42.734 --> 13:44.258
from the garage?

13:44.345 --> 13:47.261
- W-w-we're doing a job.
- Doing a job.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.654
- We're pickin' up a boat.
- Pickin' up a boat.

13:49.741 --> 13:50.699
Whose boat is it?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.657
[engine revving]

13:52.744 --> 13:54.616
- His.
- His.

13:54.703 --> 13:55.791
[tires screeching]

14:00.491 --> 14:02.363
[indistinct chatter]

14:13.548 --> 14:15.506
[whispers]
You touched my car.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.466
[whispers]
What?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.207
You touched my car!

14:20.294 --> 14:22.209
Right! Well, let me
just get it clean, then!

14:22.296 --> 14:23.253
You touched it again!

14:23.340 --> 14:24.298
Don't ever touch

14:24.385 --> 14:27.257
my car again, ever, ever!

14:27.344 --> 14:28.955
Don't touch my car

14:29.042 --> 14:31.218
ever, ever again!

14:31.305 --> 14:32.610
Teddy, honey...

14:32.697 --> 14:34.221
...can we go pick up
your boat?

14:34.308 --> 14:35.787
Ever!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.442
Remember? Your new boat?

14:39.443 --> 14:41.315
[instrumental music]

14:47.147 --> 14:49.018
[Teddy]
Ty, bring in the Stork twins!

14:52.543 --> 14:53.544
Come here.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.417
[grunting]

14:56.504 --> 14:57.461
Ow!

14:59.115 --> 15:00.464
Boy, I wouldn't have
come, anyways.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.771
- Ow. Ow, ow.
- Now, move that tow truck!

15:02.858 --> 15:04.773
Let's go! Hustle!

15:04.860 --> 15:06.166
Uh, my shoe!

15:09.865 --> 15:12.955

That is some tuna.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.965
[music on stereo player]

15:30.233 --> 15:31.887
[dog whining]

15:31.974 --> 15:35.238
Grammy, the high school
graduates are here.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.457
Oh!

15:36.544 --> 15:38.894
Look who it is.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.461
Grammy!

15:40.548 --> 15:42.680
My pride and joy.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.161
There's my little girl.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.250
[chuckling]

15:47.337 --> 15:49.296
Look what grammy bought for you.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.254
[dog whining]

15:53.517 --> 15:56.303
Would you like some nice
milk and cookies?

15:56.390 --> 15:59.567
Come on, your grammy
will show you where you go...

15:59.654 --> 16:00.916
Nice meeting you too.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.919
She's nuts about me.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.181
Oh, yeah.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.531
Come on, you gotta meet
my Uncle Frank.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.491
[male #2 on radio]
One million dollars.

16:10.578 --> 16:11.579
This is it.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.189
We guarantee it.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.670
This is your summer to win!

16:15.757 --> 16:17.367
Keep it here and listen

16:17.454 --> 16:18.890
for this jingle.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.892
[male #3 on radio]
95.5 FM.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.286
Music money time.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.158
[male #2]
If you, yes, you

16:25.245 --> 16:27.116
are our fiftieth caller...

16:27.203 --> 16:30.424
One million dollars is all yours!

16:30.511 --> 16:32.078
That's right.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.080
Hey, Uncle Frank.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.733
Georgie? Georgie!

16:35.820 --> 16:38.910
- What are you doin' in here?
- Still at it, huh?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.347
My God, Would you get out
of here? What do you think?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.262
I'm playing games?
I need to be left alone!

16:42.349 --> 16:45.004
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

16:45.091 --> 16:48.703
Every summer he sits there
trying to win that radio show.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.880
Every summer he loses
a little bit more of his mind.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.535
Why don't they just leave me
alone with my dream?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.841
[music on radio]

16:56.928 --> 16:58.582

Okay.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.329
[gun cocks]
There.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.549
Now, Billy, take this
to the back room.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.941
Field strip it.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.292
[loud clattering]

17:13.380 --> 17:15.946
Careful with that thing!

17:16.035 --> 17:17.688
Boys, tourniquet!

17:17.775 --> 17:19.516
[bell dinging]

17:22.780 --> 17:24.913
- Calamari.
- Mr. Raymond.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.349
Thought you'd be
in prison by now.

17:27.436 --> 17:28.612
What can I do for you?

17:28.699 --> 17:29.961
We're looking for Acky.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.182
Uh, this is my friend,
Hoops McCann.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.923
Quit monkeying with that thing!

17:35.010 --> 17:36.316
Sorry.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.710
Well, another wasted summer,
huh, boys?

17:39.797 --> 17:41.060
Why don't you go in with Acky?

17:41.147 --> 17:42.191
Just think of it.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.627
Death from above!

17:43.714 --> 17:45.151
Airborne!

17:45.238 --> 17:46.674
Excuse me if I'm wrong, sir

17:46.761 --> 17:48.284
but, uh, Acky throws up

17:48.371 --> 17:50.373
on the Ferris wheel
at the children's park.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.767
You've got no college
acceptance, George.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.508
You've got no direction
with your lives.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.118
No, no plan.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.902
When there's no plan,
there's no attack.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.948
And no attack,
there's no victory.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.080
[clattering]

18:01.167 --> 18:02.516
This!

18:02.603 --> 18:04.866
This is what makes men, men.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.172
I'll have to pick one up.

18:08.391 --> 18:09.871
Anyway, where's Acky?

18:09.958 --> 18:12.656
Oh, he's out on a mission
for his old man.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.093
- A mission, sir?
- Yeah.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.269
He's on the beach,
collecting shells.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.879
Well, that's a little bit

18:17.966 --> 18:20.186
more like Acky's speed.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.144
[explosions]

18:28.194 --> 18:29.847
Acky, what are you doing?

18:29.934 --> 18:32.459
George, take cover!

18:36.854 --> 18:39.466
Your dad said you were
collecting shells.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.597
Shells.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.338
Fifty seven millimeter.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.253
My dad gets 12 bucks
a piece for them.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.473
They make great paperweights.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.431
Hi, I'm Ack Ack.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.868
Let's get outta here.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.957
Come on, over the top, boys!

18:53.044 --> 18:54.785
Nobody lives forever!

18:56.744 --> 18:59.268
Oh, my God!

19:03.707 --> 19:05.579
[explosions]

19:08.451 --> 19:09.670
You could've waited
till they were done

19:09.757 --> 19:11.498
bombing the beach,
I mean, come on.

19:11.585 --> 19:15.066
[panting]
When the man says go, you go.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.677
You could have been killed.

19:16.764 --> 19:17.808
[intense music]

19:17.895 --> 19:19.636
Oh, my God!

19:31.474 --> 19:34.825
Do you realize
for every lost, mangled doll

19:34.912 --> 19:37.959
there's a little girl
with a broken heart?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.874
Sure you wanna be
a marine, Acky?

19:39.961 --> 19:41.354
I mean, I just don't

19:41.441 --> 19:43.660
see you having
the killer instinct.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.143
[music continues]

19:53.192 --> 19:54.932
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

19:55.019 --> 19:56.804

19:56.891 --> 19:58.414
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

19:58.501 --> 20:00.242
of the shadow of death..."

20:00.329 --> 20:01.678
What's going on?

"Thou preparest
a table before me

20:03.724 --> 20:05.247

20:05.334 --> 20:07.945
Thou anointest my head with oil.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.034
Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me

20:54.688 --> 20:57.212

20:58.169 --> 20:59.867
Doin' my laps, dad.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.045
Ted, I would like

21:04.132 --> 21:05.829
to have a word with you.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.875
In a minute, dad.

21:09.877 --> 21:10.921
Ow!

21:12.706 --> 21:14.969
I'll try not to take up
too much of your time.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.275
Okay, okay.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.757
Are you ready
for the regatta, Ted?

21:20.844 --> 21:22.542
Yeah, sure, I'm ready.
The new sloop's a beauty.

21:22.629 --> 21:23.804
I can't lose.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.196
If you screw it up this year

21:25.284 --> 21:26.720
you and I are out...

21:27.634 --> 21:28.548
Hi, daddy.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.116
- Hi, grandpa.
- How are you?

21:32.856 --> 21:33.814
Good.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.252
If you screw it up
this year, Ted

21:37.339 --> 21:38.819
that decaying old man

21:38.906 --> 21:39.863
your grandfather

21:39.950 --> 21:41.387
takes everything away.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.127
Do you understand, Ted?

21:43.214 --> 21:44.912
If you don't come home
with that trophy

21:44.999 --> 21:47.044
we lose it all.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.829
No more pools.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.526
No more Ferrari.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.659
And do you know
what happens then, Ted?

21:53.529 --> 21:54.835
Don't say it, dad.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.271
That's right, Ted.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.099
You'll have to go to...

21:58.186 --> 22:00.406
- No! No, dad. Don't say it.
- Work, Teddy, work!

22:00.493 --> 22:01.581
Don't say that word, please!

22:01.668 --> 22:04.235
I'll win.
Just don't say that word!

22:04.323 --> 22:06.934
That's why I need
this Eldridge land.

22:07.021 --> 22:09.937
With this land,
I can finally start building

22:10.024 --> 22:11.939

22:12.026 --> 22:14.115

22:19.729 --> 22:21.949
That crazy old man
can't hold that race

22:22.036 --> 22:24.343

22:24.430 --> 22:26.519
Now, Ted...

22:26.606 --> 22:29.565
...what did you find out
about this place?

22:29.652 --> 22:32.742
Oh, Chong says he left it
to his granddaughter.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.831
She's got one week
to pay the back mortgage.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.746
And, dad, I've seen this girl.
She's a...

22:36.833 --> 22:37.878
She's a real hippie type.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.967
She wears, like, these braids.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.534
What do they
call them, cornhusks?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.101
If she don't get the money

22:44.188 --> 22:45.886
you get the house.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.627
They're already doing
the paperwork.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.063
Wonderful.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.416
Wonderful.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.375

This will be my most

23:00.727 --> 23:03.599
beautiful restaurant yet.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.561

with him all the time.

23:08.648 --> 23:11.041
[instrumental music]

23:11.128 --> 23:14.262
Your grandfather sounded like
he was a really nice man.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.395
I'm really sorry.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.700
Old Mr. Peckerhead's
been trying to...

23:17.787 --> 23:19.485
- Who?
- Beckerstead.

23:19.572 --> 23:20.703
He's been trying
to drive grandpa

23:20.790 --> 23:22.270
out of that house
since I was a baby.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.272
I guess he finally got him.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.797
So what's gonna happen,
I mean, to the house

23:27.884 --> 23:29.799
and all his friends,
what are they gonna do?

23:29.886 --> 23:31.366
The bank's given me
one week to come up

23:31.453 --> 23:33.673
with the back mortgage
of three thousand dollars.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.979
It might as well be a million.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.154
You know I just can't
let those people

23:37.241 --> 23:39.026
be thrown out on the streets.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.550
I just wish I had more time.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.770
I wish I could help.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.728
I'm not gonna give up.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.469
I figure that I can sell
some of the furniture

23:47.556 --> 23:49.645
and I'm, I'm gonna
do some clubs.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.256
You sing?

23:52.343 --> 23:53.649
Yeah, I try.

23:53.736 --> 23:54.694
Cool.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.870
I bet you're really great.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.567
Thanks.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.134
I guess basketball is your thing

24:00.221 --> 24:03.442
with a name like Hoops.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.053
Yeah, it's kinda in
the family blood, you know?

24:06.140 --> 24:08.229
My dad was really great.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.883
But I wanna do something
a little more challenging.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.101
A little different.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.320
So I figure I'm gonna try to get

24:12.407 --> 24:14.322
a scholarship to art school.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.324
What do you draw?

with short notice.

you do second best

play basketball.

let me tell you.

Oh, boy, I've got a plan.

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:13.942
Acky's got a plan.
What is it?

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.684
- The regatta.
- The regatta?

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:20.471
You know, the, the regatta.
The, the-the sailing boat race.

01:07:20.558 --> 01:07:22.864
The one boat rowing, sailing,
motoring regatta

01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.214
around Nantucket.

01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:26.172
Your planning involves a boat?

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:27.782
But Teddy's gonna win it.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:30.089
He wins every year.
Everybody knows that.

01:07:30.176 --> 01:07:32.352
Exactly, but what happens
if he doesn't win?

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.745
Well, his grandfather takes away

01:07:33.832 --> 01:07:36.313
everything he and his
father own.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.055
Basically making his life
as dreary as ours.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.669
- And?
- So, we win the race.

without the trophy.

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:47.976

even gonna be on the boat.
