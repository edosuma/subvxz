00:00.261 --> 00:03.380
Your life is about to end.

00:04.482 --> 00:08.550
You will all die.

00:08.552 --> 00:10.903
In your remaining time
on Earth,

00:10.905 --> 00:12.572
how do you want to live?

00:12.574 --> 00:15.057
As a bright and shining star?

00:15.059 --> 00:17.726
Or as a lost soul
passing time?

00:17.728 --> 00:20.062
Do you want to live
in darkness

00:20.064 --> 00:23.516
or reveal your
magnificent light?!

00:29.040 --> 00:32.758
Today you will all be reborn
as your true selves.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.211
We are all born
with a unique gift.

00:35.213 --> 00:37.096
And your only job
here on Earth--

00:37.098 --> 00:38.264
your only job--

00:38.266 --> 00:39.765
is to share that gift.

00:39.767 --> 00:42.101
Only then, only when
we have shed

00:42.103 --> 00:44.220
our magnificent light
on this world,

00:44.222 --> 00:46.689
will we experience
real purpose,

00:46.691 --> 00:48.557
real fulfillment,
and real joy.

00:50.862 --> 00:53.112
Let me tell you something
about myself.

00:53.114 --> 00:56.282
I spent 12 years
of my adult life

00:56.284 --> 00:59.986
absolutely miserable
because I did not use my gift.

00:59.988 --> 01:02.288
How many of you
are living false lives?

01:02.290 --> 01:04.940
Maybe you're an accountant.

01:04.941 --> 01:07.743
But somewhere in the dark
recesses of your mind,

01:07.745 --> 01:08.878
there's a tickle.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.447
And that tickle
is a reminder of your gift.

01:11.449 --> 01:13.582
Maybe it's a love
for painting.

01:13.584 --> 01:16.118
A love that you have had

01:16.120 --> 01:17.553
since before
you could even talk.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.505
Isn't that right,
Cynthia Strobl?

01:19.507 --> 01:21.507
You could be
the next Picasso.

01:21.509 --> 01:24.060
Why have you deprived
the world of your gift?

01:24.062 --> 01:25.961
And what about you,
Ralph Pritchard?

01:25.963 --> 01:29.198
Do you really want to listen to your
insufferable boss another day,

01:29.200 --> 01:32.818
or are you ready to start that
business you've been dreaming of?

01:32.820 --> 01:36.572
Isn't it time for you to unveil
your gift and take action?!

01:36.574 --> 01:39.525
Right here, right now,
that's what we're gonna do.

01:39.527 --> 01:42.194
Let's get started!

01:43.613 --> 01:45.247
I still can't believe this.

01:45.249 --> 01:47.583
I never, not in
a million years,

01:47.585 --> 01:49.919
thought I'd ever get to
meet you in person.

01:49.921 --> 01:51.170
And then you called
my name and--

01:51.172 --> 01:52.254
Cynthia.

01:52.256 --> 01:53.789
The pleasure
has been all mine.

01:53.791 --> 01:55.257
Now do me a favor.

01:55.259 --> 01:56.959
Go out into the world
and show them your gift.

01:56.961 --> 01:57.960
Oh, I will.

01:57.962 --> 01:58.961
I promise you.

01:58.963 --> 02:01.097
Goodbye, Cynthia.

02:04.501 --> 02:06.335
That was the last
one-on-one, Barry.

02:06.337 --> 02:08.520
There's some more folks
waiting for autographs.

02:08.523 --> 02:09.521
Not now.

02:09.524 --> 02:11.190
I need my private time.

02:11.192 --> 02:13.392
When will you be back?

02:13.394 --> 02:16.395
Okay. Whatever you want,
Barry.

02:17.397 --> 02:18.864
Sorry, folks, uh,

02:18.866 --> 02:21.734
Mr. Flynn is late
for a meeting.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.153 --> 02:59.488
So take that first step now.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.056
Be ready for resistance.

03:01.058 --> 03:03.659
Others will try to stop you.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.027
Don't let them.

03:05.029 --> 03:07.113
Don't permit them
to discourage you.

03:07.115 --> 03:09.898
Don't allow them
to stand in your way.

03:09.900 --> 03:13.252
Tell them to trust you
and glorious things will come.

03:14.238 --> 03:16.122
Oh, my God,
what are you--

03:21.077 --> 03:22.711
"Derek, would you
do me a favor

03:22.713 --> 03:24.413
and say a few words
at the shindig?"

03:24.415 --> 03:25.581
Hey.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.749
"The honor of your presence
has been requested

03:27.751 --> 03:29.751
"by her majesty's ambassador
in bestowing Jason A. Ryder

03:29.753 --> 03:32.754
the title of honorary Commander
of the Most Excellent Order"--

03:32.756 --> 03:34.473
this is from
the British embassy.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.724
Garcia, do you mind?

03:35.726 --> 03:37.226
I'm sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

03:37.228 --> 03:38.894
I saw the fancy invitation
and I couldn't help myself.

03:38.896 --> 03:39.784
We never get glamour here.

03:39.809 --> 03:41.826
It's like shoeboxes
to a hoarder.

03:42.116 --> 03:43.399
Well, you can just
forget about it.

03:43.401 --> 03:44.950
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm not going.

03:44.952 --> 03:46.935
But isn't Jason
an old friend of yours?

03:46.937 --> 03:48.120
I've heard his name before.

03:48.122 --> 03:50.156
And who's gonna give
the speech if you don't?

03:50.158 --> 03:51.407
I don't know, but
it's not going to be me.

03:51.409 --> 03:52.625
We love the British,
remember?

03:52.627 --> 03:54.443
Can we just drop this?

03:55.778 --> 03:57.446
I can go with you.

03:57.448 --> 03:58.614
Nobody is going.

03:58.616 --> 03:59.748
I'll wear my contacts.

03:59.750 --> 04:00.666
What'd I say?

04:00.668 --> 04:01.917
Who do I wear
my contacts for?

04:01.919 --> 04:04.520
Two people have been
brutally stabbed in Seattle

04:04.522 --> 04:08.390
in the last two days.
Lincoln Bell, 28,

04:08.392 --> 04:10.259
he was found
on Friday night.

04:10.261 --> 04:11.927
And then Cynthia Strobl, 42,

04:11.929 --> 04:13.362
her body was found
last night.

04:13.364 --> 04:15.181
Both of them were killed
in their own apartments.

04:15.183 --> 04:16.982
Police are sure
it's the same killer?

04:16.983 --> 04:19.567
Yes, because the same
message was left behind.

04:19.570 --> 04:22.188
"Hear your evil,
see your evil."

04:22.190 --> 04:23.572
Isn't the phrase
supposed to be

04:23.574 --> 04:25.024
"see no evil,
hear no evil"?

04:25.026 --> 04:26.525
Yeah, it certainly
changes the meaning,

04:26.527 --> 04:28.027
which is supposed to be
about remaining virtuous

04:28.029 --> 04:29.478
even when you're
surrounded by evil.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.614
Well, the question is, did the
killer just get the phrase wrong,

04:31.616 --> 04:33.949
or was he trying to send
a completely different message?

04:33.951 --> 04:36.652
The killer could have been
a non-native-English speaker.

04:36.654 --> 04:39.505
But this syntax doesn't help identify
his first language.

04:39.507 --> 04:41.674
And the other question is,
who is this message for?

04:41.676 --> 04:43.342
Is it a taunt to the police?

04:43.344 --> 04:45.461
It could be used
to justify the murders.

04:45.463 --> 04:46.712
You know, if you take
the words literally,

04:46.714 --> 04:48.848
if sounds like he's speaking
directly to the victims.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.166
Was the message written
with the victims' blood?

04:51.168 --> 04:52.885
The lab results
aren't back yet.

04:52.887 --> 04:54.270
Are there any witnesses?

04:54.272 --> 04:55.721
It doesn't look that way.

04:55.723 --> 04:58.190
Which means the entry to the apartments
was planned and methodical,

04:58.192 --> 05:00.526
but the actually killings
seem chaotic and disorganized.

05:00.528 --> 05:02.194
Maybe the unsub
knew them

05:02.196 --> 05:04.146
and took the time
to plan his break-in,

05:04.148 --> 05:07.032
but once he got close,
his rage took over and he snapped.

05:07.034 --> 05:09.851
You know, one thing's for sure.
With at least 30 stab wounds

05:09.853 --> 05:12.204
to each victim, this unsub
sure has a lot of anger.

05:12.206 --> 05:14.573
We need more answers.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.876
Let's head to Seattle.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.843

what are you--aah!

"A great deal of
talent is lost to the world

06:16.297 --> 06:18.214
for the want
of a little courage."

06:18.216 --> 06:20.633
Sydney Smith.

06:20.635 --> 06:23.336
There's doesn't seem to be
a connection between the two victims.

06:23.338 --> 06:26.205
Different gender, race, age.

06:26.207 --> 06:27.924
And they lived in different
parts of the city.

06:27.926 --> 06:29.809
Yeah. Lincoln Bell
worked in ticket sales

06:29.811 --> 06:31.644
at El Portal auditorium
for the last 3 years.

06:31.646 --> 06:33.312
Cynthia Strobl
was an accountant.

06:33.314 --> 06:35.148
She moved to Seattle
a year ago.

06:35.150 --> 06:38.568
It's unlikely they would
have ever crossed paths.

06:38.570 --> 06:41.220
Unless Cynthia bought a ticket
from him at one point.

06:41.222 --> 06:43.823
According to his mother,
Lincoln's dream was to be an architect.

06:43.825 --> 06:45.742
If he wasn't working,
he was studying.

06:45.744 --> 06:47.994
And Cynthia liked big band
music and lectures at the museum,

06:47.996 --> 06:49.862
so the one thing
they did have in common

06:49.864 --> 06:51.280
was very low-risk lifestyles.

06:51.282 --> 06:54.567
Okay, I've confirmed that Cynthia
lived in a security complex,

06:54.569 --> 06:56.836
the kind you need
a special key fob to get in.

06:56.838 --> 07:00.256
And Lincoln was living in a
studio apartment at the top floor

07:00.258 --> 07:01.407
of a 6-story walkup.

07:01.409 --> 07:02.925
So the unsub had
the intelligence and the patience

07:02.927 --> 07:04.410
to get past
the security entrance.

07:04.412 --> 07:06.879
He either used a ruse or he blended in
with the other residents.

07:06.881 --> 07:09.766
And he had to be in good
physical shape to kill Lincoln Bell.

07:09.768 --> 07:12.518
So, he bypassed easier victims
and potential witnesses

07:12.520 --> 07:14.754
to commit these murders.

07:14.756 --> 07:16.088
He was mission oriented.

07:16.090 --> 07:18.941
Someone went out of their way
to target these two people.

07:18.943 --> 07:20.593
Yeah, look at these
crime scene photos.

07:20.595 --> 07:23.279
There's not a hint of remorse.
This unsub was determined and relentless,

07:23.281 --> 07:25.064
like he couldn't kill
these victims enough.

07:25.066 --> 07:27.767
And the different typology means
they weren't surrogates for anyone.

07:27.769 --> 07:30.051
So each victim probably
did something separately

07:30.076 --> 07:31.271
to incite the unsub's rage.

07:31.272 --> 07:34.123
But it must have been
the same trigger that set him off,

07:34.125 --> 07:36.125
because the murders
were so similar.

07:36.127 --> 07:39.879
So, they had something in common
outside of low-risk lifestyles.

07:39.881 --> 07:41.614
We need a point
of convergence,

07:41.616 --> 07:44.167
either a person or a place between
the unsub and these two victims.

07:44.169 --> 07:46.152
Cause of death was massive
hemorrhage.

07:46.154 --> 07:48.671
Both the carotid and
the femoral arteries

07:48.673 --> 07:51.290
were severed, in addition
to the other stab wounds.

07:51.292 --> 07:54.293
There's no signs of any other
injuries or of sexual assault.

07:54.295 --> 07:56.179
Were the arteries
cut first?

07:56.181 --> 07:58.648
It's hard to say,
but it's very likely.

07:58.650 --> 07:59.965
The first victim,
Lincoln Bell,

07:59.967 --> 08:03.770
he had the same targeted
lacerations to those arteries.

08:03.772 --> 08:06.489
The other stab wounds,
they seem more random.

08:06.491 --> 08:07.774
So the unsub knew
the best way to kill them,

08:07.776 --> 08:09.475
but he stabbed them
multiple times afterwards

08:09.477 --> 08:10.660
to express his rage.

08:10.662 --> 08:12.161
There's also something else
that's unusual.

08:12.163 --> 08:14.363
These stab wounds have
a curvature to them.

08:14.365 --> 08:16.315
They weren't made with
an ordinary straight blade.

08:16.317 --> 08:17.784
What sort of knife
did he use?

08:17.786 --> 08:19.418
Based on my measurements,
they were curved,

08:19.420 --> 08:20.770
sort of like a half circle.

08:20.772 --> 08:22.505
Like a mezzaluna.

08:22.507 --> 08:25.007
Does a mezzaluna
look like this?

08:26.927 --> 08:28.678
Not exactly.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.496
The knife that made
these wounds

08:30.498 --> 08:32.548
probably had a vertical
handle at least

08:32.549 --> 08:35.183
6 inches long in order to get
the leverage for the depth.

08:35.186 --> 08:38.671
You know, it looks like
a ceremonial weapon of some sort.

08:38.673 --> 08:39.938
I agree.

08:39.941 --> 08:42.842
These killings could be
sacrificial.

08:44.178 --> 08:45.177
Agent Hotchner.

08:45.179 --> 08:46.312
Yes, sir.

08:46.314 --> 08:47.563
Detective Harrison Chen.
Thanks for coming out.

08:47.565 --> 08:48.681
This is Agent Blake.

08:48.683 --> 08:49.682
Pleasure.

08:49.684 --> 08:50.817
Lab results are back.

08:50.819 --> 08:52.652
It's not blood
on the walls.

08:52.654 --> 08:55.037
Killer used a red paint that's
widely available in hardware stores.

08:55.039 --> 08:56.355
Paint belong to the victim?

08:56.357 --> 08:59.041
Nothing turned up in our
initial search, so...

08:59.043 --> 09:01.160
If the unsub brought
the paint with him,

09:01.162 --> 09:03.379
that means the message
was also premeditated.

09:03.381 --> 09:05.081
It could be a forensic
countermeasure,

09:05.083 --> 09:06.833
like the messages
in the MacDonald case.

09:06.835 --> 09:09.468
Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald
was convicted

09:09.470 --> 09:11.220
of murdering his family.

09:11.222 --> 09:14.473
Supposedly he left messages
to convince authorities

09:14.475 --> 09:16.041
that hippies had done it.

09:16.043 --> 09:17.009
Hmm.

09:17.011 --> 09:18.344
Uh, we spoke
to the neighbors.

09:18.346 --> 09:20.096
Apparently Cynthia
was gone all evening.

09:20.098 --> 09:22.598
No one knows where she was
or when she came home.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.267
Seems she's quiet,
kept to herself.

09:24.269 --> 09:25.985
The unsub could have
followed her home

09:25.987 --> 09:28.604
or been waiting for her here.

09:28.606 --> 09:30.439
Hotch, take a look
at this.

09:30.441 --> 09:33.159
The CD player
was left on.

09:33.161 --> 09:37.079
You are about to embark
on the greatest adventure known to man.

09:37.081 --> 09:41.233
That adventure
is your own life.

09:41.235 --> 09:44.904
She was there
before she was murdered.

09:44.906 --> 09:47.573
So where is Mr. Flynn now?

09:47.575 --> 09:49.258
You haven't told me
what this is about yet.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.928
Check the vari-lights. There
was a weird shadow last night.

09:51.930 --> 09:53.484
We need information
about these people.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.132
Do you recognize them?

09:55.133 --> 09:56.933
Not him.

09:56.935 --> 09:59.919
But her, yeah.
She was at the show last night.

09:59.921 --> 10:02.805
She was one of the guests that got a
one-on-one with Barry afterwards.

10:02.807 --> 10:05.441
And how
would someone get that?

10:05.443 --> 10:08.311
People who buy advance
tickets fill out a questionnaire.

10:08.313 --> 10:10.420
Barry randomly selects 5

10:10.445 --> 10:12.808
and mentions them by name
during the show.

10:13.034 --> 10:16.485
It's pretty mind-blowing
to the people who are picked.

10:16.487 --> 10:17.787
We can imagine.

10:17.789 --> 10:20.456
Tell me, what goes on
during one of these one-on-ones?

10:20.458 --> 10:22.658
Just mini life-coaching
sessions.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.710
It's only about 15 minutes,

10:24.712 --> 10:27.163
but people come out
transformed.

10:27.165 --> 10:29.131
And did Cynthia look
transformed?

10:29.133 --> 10:31.500
Probably. But I didn't
actually see her.

10:31.502 --> 10:32.919
She was Barry's last client.

10:32.921 --> 10:34.470
He showed her out himself.

10:34.472 --> 10:36.806
Flynn was probably
the last person to see her alive.

10:36.808 --> 10:39.175
Wait--she's dead?

10:39.177 --> 10:40.726
She was murdered.

10:40.728 --> 10:42.395
So let me ask you again,

10:42.397 --> 10:45.064
where's Barry Flynn?

10:45.066 --> 10:46.565
I don't know.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.517
He needs private time

10:48.519 --> 10:50.937
to rest and focus his mind.

10:50.939 --> 10:52.905
It's part of his routine
on show days.

10:52.907 --> 10:55.574
But you're his manager.
You can't get ahold of him?

10:55.576 --> 10:58.110
Sorry. To make sure
he's not interrupted,

10:58.112 --> 10:59.812
no one knows
where he goes.

10:59.814 --> 11:01.247
Not me. Not his family.

11:01.249 --> 11:03.199
Not anyone.

11:03.201 --> 11:04.650
It's always been like that.

11:04.652 --> 11:06.836
Well, if you
had to take a guess,

11:06.838 --> 11:07.987
where do you
think he'd be?

11:07.989 --> 11:10.155
He books a hotel room
or an apartment

11:10.157 --> 11:12.291
in every tour city.
He's probably there.

11:12.293 --> 11:14.010
He's always back
in time for the show.

11:14.012 --> 11:15.494
What time did Barry leave?

11:15.496 --> 11:17.330
Last night.

11:17.332 --> 11:20.516
It was earlier
than usual.

11:29.359 --> 11:32.228
Want some company?

11:32.230 --> 11:34.847
Sure.

11:37.017 --> 11:38.701
I haven't seen you
here before.

11:38.703 --> 11:39.702
I'm just visiting.

11:39.704 --> 11:40.703
Lucky you.

11:40.705 --> 11:42.521
Nice weather for a change.

11:42.523 --> 11:44.373
I was hoping for rain.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.375
More romantic.

11:46.377 --> 11:48.044
I'm Ricky.

11:48.046 --> 11:50.129
Harold.

11:50.131 --> 11:51.530
Have you seen the sights?

11:51.532 --> 11:53.866
Space Needle, Pike's Place
market, the aquarium?

11:53.868 --> 11:55.200
The first two, yes,

11:55.202 --> 11:56.669
the aquarium, no.

11:56.671 --> 11:58.671
Want a tour guide?

11:58.673 --> 12:00.773
Why not?

12:05.045 --> 12:06.812
We confirmed
Flynn's been Mia

12:06.814 --> 12:09.315
since his private
meeting with Cynthia Strobl,

12:09.317 --> 12:11.216
which officially
makes him a suspect.

12:11.218 --> 12:13.269
Well, he's a point of convergence
between the victims.

12:13.271 --> 12:15.281
Lincoln Bell had a program
personally autographed

12:15.306 --> 12:16.189
by Flynn in his apartment,

12:16.190 --> 12:17.323
so we know they met.

12:17.325 --> 12:18.824
Yeah. Flynn was one of
the last people,

12:18.826 --> 12:22.111
if not the last person
to see Cynthia Strobl alive.

12:23.247 --> 12:24.396
Hey, Garcia.

12:24.398 --> 12:25.831
You're on speaker.
What do you got?

12:25.833 --> 12:27.783
The 4-double-1
on Barry Flynn.

12:27.785 --> 12:30.419
Hey, has anyone been listening
to this "Unlimited Courage,"

12:30.421 --> 12:31.737
'cause it's pretty amazing.

12:31.739 --> 12:33.238
I've just finished
the first CD

12:33.240 --> 12:35.257
and I've already signed up
for kickboxing class,

12:35.259 --> 12:36.842
and I painted a wall
in my apartment white.

12:36.844 --> 12:38.461
Which is a risky color
in my world.

12:38.463 --> 12:39.462
Garcia.

12:39.464 --> 12:40.679
Oh, sorry. Uh, well,

12:40.681 --> 12:42.247
Barry Flynn's is actually
a stage name.

12:42.249 --> 12:43.349
What's his real name?

12:43.351 --> 12:45.267
His real name
is Harold Kerwin.

12:45.269 --> 12:48.170
Although he never legally
changed it, though.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.139
He was raised
in Reno, Nevada.

12:50.141 --> 12:52.358
He went to a 2-year
community college.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.959
He got married right after.

12:53.961 --> 12:56.095
He has a couple of assault charges
for some bar fights.

12:56.097 --> 12:58.981
And then he worked
for 12 years as a car salesman

12:58.983 --> 13:00.449
before he left
the rat race.

13:00.451 --> 13:01.567
How so?

13:01.569 --> 13:03.602
He checked out,
like quit his job,

13:03.604 --> 13:05.621
got a divorce, ran off to live
in the desert.

13:05.623 --> 13:08.124
Came back 3 years later
and he was Barry Flynn.

13:08.126 --> 13:11.460
He started talking
at schools and local clubs,

13:11.462 --> 13:13.508
built up this following,
became sort of

13:13.533 --> 13:14.781
an overnight sensation.

13:14.782 --> 13:17.783
Within 3 years he was selling out
1,000-seat venues.

13:17.785 --> 13:19.871
Any idea what happened
to him in those 3 years

13:19.896 --> 13:21.004
while he was in the desert?

13:21.005 --> 13:22.221
Well, according to Flynn,

13:22.223 --> 13:23.672
he meditated a lot,

13:23.674 --> 13:27.176
until his true gift
was revealed to him.

13:27.178 --> 13:30.179
I hate to admit it,
but it sounds pretty vague to me.

13:30.181 --> 13:31.463
Thanks.

13:31.465 --> 13:32.832
Never would've guessed
he had a prior

13:32.834 --> 13:34.350
assault conviction.
He could be our guy.

13:35.353 --> 13:36.318
Chen.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.154
Flynn had the means
and the opportunity.

13:38.156 --> 13:40.489
I'm just not clear
about the motive.

13:40.491 --> 13:42.658
We all know that public
figures like politicians

13:42.660 --> 13:45.661
can have psychopathic
tendencies and the ability to hide it.

13:45.663 --> 13:47.246
But it doesn't
make any sense

13:47.248 --> 13:50.082
that he'd kill
his own paying customers.

13:50.084 --> 13:51.951
And why start here,
in Seattle?

13:51.953 --> 13:55.087
Why leave the bizarre message
at the crime scenes?

13:55.089 --> 13:57.873
Well, Flynn's obviously
a native English speaker,

13:57.875 --> 14:00.676
so, if he is the unsub,

14:00.678 --> 14:02.428
then the message
could be indicative

14:02.430 --> 14:04.964
of some sort of delusion
or psychosis.

14:04.966 --> 14:07.633
That is possible given
the ceremonial knife that was used.

14:07.635 --> 14:09.268
You know, no history
of recent head trauma.

14:09.270 --> 14:11.854
He's too old to have suffered a
traditional schizophrenic break.

14:11.856 --> 14:13.139
Maybe a drug-induced
psychosis?

14:13.141 --> 14:15.141
No. Flynn's
clean as a whistle.

14:15.143 --> 14:17.193
Doesn't even eat dairy
according to his bio.

14:17.195 --> 14:18.455
Well, as a celebrity,

14:18.480 --> 14:20.582
he has a vested interest
in a clean image.

14:21.515 --> 14:22.898
But who was he, really?

14:22.900 --> 14:27.036
Flynn's rental car was just
located outside a bar in Alki.

14:32.710 --> 14:35.360
How did you
end up where you are today.

14:35.362 --> 14:37.496
Was it a conscious choice?

14:37.498 --> 14:41.800
Or does it feel like you had
no control in the matter?

14:42.752 --> 14:46.138
You made me do this,
Barry Flynn.

14:59.043 --> 15:02.162
I guess we know how he was
spending his "private time."

15:02.164 --> 15:03.947
Too bad he couldn't
be open about it.

15:03.949 --> 15:06.633
He's probably afraid
it would hurt his public image.

15:06.635 --> 15:09.069
It's the same blood type
as Flynn's.

15:09.071 --> 15:10.854
We're running a DNA test.

15:10.856 --> 15:12.172
We also found this.

15:12.174 --> 15:14.491
It's a 100-decibel
personal alarm.

15:14.493 --> 15:17.511
Flynn's manager said
he always carried it with him,

15:17.513 --> 15:18.845
for protection.

15:18.847 --> 15:22.182
Flynn's not the unsub,
he's a victim.

15:22.184 --> 15:25.185
He felt threatened enough
to be holding the alarm,

15:25.187 --> 15:27.354
dropped it when
the unsub clocked him

15:27.356 --> 15:29.656
and took him away
in another vehicle.

15:29.658 --> 15:33.076
No surveillance cameras. Guess
the customers like their privacy.

15:33.078 --> 15:36.646
So, what, did Flynn meet
the unsub in the bar?

15:36.648 --> 15:40.617
Probably. No one inside
noticed anything unusual,

15:40.619 --> 15:42.652
so they came out
together voluntarily.

15:42.654 --> 15:45.255
Maybe Flynn
had a change of heart

15:45.257 --> 15:47.457
and the unsub got angry.

15:47.459 --> 15:48.455
We talked to the staff.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.480
None of them remember
even seeing Flynn.

15:50.512 --> 15:52.212
Well, he'd probably
wear a disguise

15:52.214 --> 15:54.047
if he wanted to be
anonymous in public.

15:54.049 --> 15:56.049
So the unsub
didn't know who he was?

15:56.051 --> 15:57.050
Maybe not.

15:57.052 --> 15:58.835
But the M.O.'s
different here.

15:58.837 --> 16:01.555
Flynn wasn't blitz attacked
at home like the others.

16:01.557 --> 16:03.390
What if Flynn was
the ultimate target

16:03.392 --> 16:05.358
and the others were
used to get information on him?

16:05.360 --> 16:08.177
Or maybe the other
victims got in the way.

16:08.179 --> 16:10.847
We could be looking
at an extreme fan.

16:10.849 --> 16:12.482
Yeah, someone could
have followed him here.

16:12.484 --> 16:14.385
Most of the workers
and stagehands in Flynn's

16:14.410 --> 16:15.843
company are volunteers.

16:16.572 --> 16:19.355
So he'd be surrounded by fanatics.
He'd be watching his every move.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.708
Well, let's just hope it was
one of them who nabbed him.

16:21.710 --> 16:22.959
Why?

16:22.961 --> 16:25.695
Because then there's
a chance he's still alive.

16:26.747 --> 16:29.583
The greatest
gift is inside you already.

16:29.585 --> 16:32.302
It's always been there,
a constant companion.

16:33.305 --> 16:35.505
When I heard that,

16:35.507 --> 16:38.374
I finally understood
that I had to use my gift.

16:38.376 --> 16:41.210
When I was a kid,
I used to talk about it,

16:41.212 --> 16:43.046
until people said
that I sounded weird.

16:43.048 --> 16:45.548
And I hated it because
it made me different.

16:45.550 --> 16:47.734
And I tried to shut it off,
but I didn't want to--

16:47.736 --> 16:49.069
What did you do to me?

16:49.071 --> 16:50.386
You wouldn't come with me,

16:50.388 --> 16:52.722
and I had to do what I needed
to do to get you to listen.

16:52.724 --> 16:53.740
Listen to what?

16:53.742 --> 16:56.610
4 months ago,

16:56.612 --> 16:59.412
I was fired.
Couldn't get another job.

16:59.414 --> 17:02.249
I was an unemployed,
middle-aged loser

17:02.251 --> 17:04.867
with no prospects.

17:04.869 --> 17:06.752
I almost killed myself.

17:06.755 --> 17:08.255
Then I found you.

17:08.257 --> 17:09.923
What's your name?

17:09.925 --> 17:11.074
Carl.

17:11.076 --> 17:12.709
Carl Finster.

17:12.711 --> 17:16.412
Carl, I can see
that you're in pain.

17:16.414 --> 17:19.049
I'm not.

17:19.050 --> 17:21.101
I feel alive.

17:21.103 --> 17:23.752
Like--like electricity
is running through me.

17:25.390 --> 17:26.606
Can you take these off?

17:26.608 --> 17:29.793
I won't try to escape.
I promise.

17:29.795 --> 17:33.146
I'm here for you.

17:33.148 --> 17:34.531
You're lying.

17:34.533 --> 17:36.432
I don't blame you.

17:36.434 --> 17:38.318
I just need you
to hear me out

17:38.320 --> 17:40.236
until I know
that you're convinced.

17:40.238 --> 17:41.454
Convinced of what?

17:41.456 --> 17:44.791
That I'm your biggest
success story.

17:44.793 --> 17:48.044
While we initially thought
Barry Flynn might be a suspect,

17:48.046 --> 17:50.463
it turns out we're looking
for one of his followers.

17:50.465 --> 17:53.300
An unsub who suffers
from erotomania.

17:53.302 --> 17:55.669
He's obsessed with Flynn,
his latest abductee,

17:55.671 --> 17:58.505
and he may believe that
Flynn's also in love with him.

17:58.507 --> 18:00.757
Erotomania has very little
to do with sex.

18:00.759 --> 18:03.643
It's a romantic or spiritual connection
that erotomanics crave.

18:03.645 --> 18:06.563
Victims of the delusion tend to be
from a higher social status

18:06.565 --> 18:09.816
and have done very little to
stimulate or encourage such a belief.

18:09.818 --> 18:12.152
In fact, it's likely

18:12.154 --> 18:15.304
the unsub and Barry Flynn
have had no previous contact.

18:15.306 --> 18:17.657
His infatuation probably
began from afar,

18:17.659 --> 18:20.360
considering Flynn's
celebrity status.

18:20.362 --> 18:22.696
The patience required
to commit his crimes

18:22.698 --> 18:25.031
makes us believe
he's a male

18:25.033 --> 18:26.916
in his late 30s to 40s

18:26.918 --> 18:29.336
who is single
and socially immature.

18:29.338 --> 18:32.005
He's a loner
with poor social skills.

18:32.007 --> 18:34.758
And although he is capable
of holding down a job,

18:34.760 --> 18:37.510
he most likely neglects his duties
to focus on his obsession.

18:37.512 --> 18:39.512
This is a guy who spends
much of his time

18:39.514 --> 18:41.497
living in his delusional
fantasy world.

18:41.499 --> 18:44.184
And he may have been
tracking Flynn for quite some time.

18:44.186 --> 18:46.519
And with erotomania,
the most likely recipient of violence

18:46.521 --> 18:49.672
is the person standing in the way
of the desired object.

18:49.674 --> 18:52.308
It's possible the unsub
witnessed an interaction

18:52.310 --> 18:55.178
between his two first
victims and Flynn,

18:55.180 --> 18:57.013
killing them
in a jealous rage.

18:57.015 --> 18:59.566
Another possibility
is that the unsub killed them

18:59.568 --> 19:01.117
to prove his devotion.

19:01.119 --> 19:03.286
The weapon used
had a ceremonial quality to it.

19:03.288 --> 19:04.849
Which means the unsub
probably views these

19:04.874 --> 19:06.937
victims as sacrifices,
and the messages

19:06.938 --> 19:09.437
he is leaving
may be meant for Flynn.

19:09.878 --> 19:12.028
In his head, he may believe

19:12.030 --> 19:14.864
that he's already involved
in a personal relationship with Flynn.

19:14.866 --> 19:16.699
And now that Flynn
is under his control,

19:16.701 --> 19:19.252
this situation is
especially precarious.

19:19.254 --> 19:21.221
If the unsub
is under the delusion

19:21.223 --> 19:23.506
that Flynn
also cares about him,

19:23.508 --> 19:26.726
then any misstep by Flynn
that contradicts that belief,

19:26.728 --> 19:29.929
could lead to more victims
or even Flynn's own murder,

19:29.931 --> 19:32.265
to prove they have
a special bond.

19:32.267 --> 19:34.184
With each passing hour,
it's increasingly unlikely

19:34.186 --> 19:36.886
that Flynn will be able to match
the unsub's expectations for him.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.387
So we must act quickly.

19:38.389 --> 19:39.689
Thank you.

19:39.691 --> 19:42.391
I've ignored my gift
for so long.

19:42.393 --> 19:43.493
What is your gift?

19:43.495 --> 19:45.328
I don't hear things
the way most people do.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.279
I see it.

19:46.281 --> 19:48.248
What does that mean?

19:48.250 --> 19:51.751
Well, when people talk,

19:51.753 --> 19:53.069
I know the truth about them.

19:53.071 --> 19:54.204
You know the truth.

19:54.206 --> 19:55.622
Like I knew you were
lying when you said

19:55.624 --> 19:57.240
you wouldn't try to escape.

19:57.242 --> 19:59.603
A doctor told my parents
that there was a wire

19:59.628 --> 20:01.278
crossed in my brain.

20:01.279 --> 20:03.079
It's harmless.
Kind of like a birthmark.

20:03.081 --> 20:06.549
But thanks to you,
I know he was wrong.

20:06.551 --> 20:07.917
How so?

20:07.919 --> 20:09.519
Because it's more
than a birthmark.

20:09.521 --> 20:11.304
I got this ability
for a reason,

20:11.306 --> 20:12.889
and what I need to do
is take action,

20:12.891 --> 20:14.357
and that's what
you've been telling me.

20:14.359 --> 20:15.775
What are you planning
to do, Carl?

20:15.777 --> 20:17.310
Let me show you.

20:17.312 --> 20:19.362
We said that this unsub
had poor social skills,

20:19.364 --> 20:21.731
so how did he lure Flynn
out of the bar?

20:21.733 --> 20:23.399
Good question.
Maybe he had help

20:23.401 --> 20:24.868
from someone
with more charisma.

20:24.870 --> 20:26.870
Well, we should amend the profile,
let the media know

20:26.872 --> 20:28.905
That there may be
a temporary partner involved.

20:28.907 --> 20:30.206
All right,
I'll call Garcia

20:30.208 --> 20:32.659
and get her to narrow
the list of seminar attendees.

20:32.661 --> 20:33.626
Hey, baby girl.

20:33.628 --> 20:35.778
If loving you is wrong,
baby boy,

20:35.780 --> 20:37.096
I don't want to be right.

20:37.098 --> 20:38.331
Well, likewise, mama.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.550
I need you to look into
fans of Barry Flynn.

20:40.552 --> 20:42.252
Oh, I already have
those numbers for you.

20:42.254 --> 20:44.729
He has over two million fans
worldwide,

20:44.730 --> 20:46.674
and the kind that are crazy
infatuated with him,

20:46.699 --> 20:48.266
I would say about 100,000.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.255
Hey, do you know that
if you join Barry's

20:50.280 --> 20:52.179
official circle of friends,

20:52.180 --> 20:56.182
you get the "Unlimited
Courage" 12-CD set for 49.99,

20:56.184 --> 20:58.852
plus a free "Live or die,
you choose" mug.

20:58.854 --> 21:00.737
Come on, don't tell me
you joined.

21:00.739 --> 21:02.361
No. Why would you say that?
I didn't--I didn't do that.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.715
There's just things
I need motivation for.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.693
Like I had that cupcake problem,

21:05.694 --> 21:07.015
and I really wanted to learn
how to play the clarinet.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.192
And Barry Flynn is a good guy
who really helps people,

21:09.217 --> 21:10.831
and I want you to find him.

21:10.832 --> 21:12.315
We're doing our best, girl.

21:12.317 --> 21:14.200
By the way,
totally different subject--

21:14.202 --> 21:16.819
I happened upon
that invitation guest list

21:16.821 --> 21:18.922
for the British embassy thing.
Did you know that Madonna

21:18.924 --> 21:20.590
and Stephen Hawking are going?

21:20.592 --> 21:22.041
Not together, but they're going.

21:22.043 --> 21:23.159
Penelope...

21:23.161 --> 21:24.878
Seriously, you're gonna
miss a chance

21:24.880 --> 21:27.463
to meet Stephen Hawking?
Reid will kill you.

21:27.465 --> 21:28.882
Well, then I'm dead.

21:28.884 --> 21:31.050
Why don't you want to go?

21:31.052 --> 21:33.853
It's personal.
How about that?

21:33.855 --> 21:35.772
Oh, it's per--
oh, my God, it's personal?

21:35.774 --> 21:37.557
That never occurred to me
that it would be personal.

21:37.559 --> 21:39.108
I thought is was like
stock market related

21:39.110 --> 21:40.727
or 'cause of the weather.

21:40.729 --> 21:41.861
Will you cut it out,
already.

21:41.863 --> 21:46.032
Okay. Keep your super secrets
to yourself, 007.

21:46.034 --> 21:47.202
Look, just do me a favor.

21:47.227 --> 21:49.586
Find out how many of Flynn's
uberfans live in Seattle.

21:50.355 --> 21:52.071
Then I want you
to narrow it down even more

21:52.073 --> 21:54.240
by cross-referencing with people
with anger management issues.

21:54.242 --> 21:56.025
thank you and goodbye, Garcia.
Yeah, Derek--

21:56.027 --> 21:57.827
Hello?

22:02.583 --> 22:05.368
What are you doing here,
Carl?

22:05.370 --> 22:08.171
Uh, I was missing
a personal photo.

22:08.173 --> 22:09.806
Thought maybe
I left it here.

22:09.808 --> 22:11.707
Your cubicle was cleaned out
when you were fired.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.343
What do you really want?

22:13.345 --> 22:16.062
You made a big mistake
when you fired me.

22:16.064 --> 22:18.898
I mean--I don't have a gun, if that's what
you're worried about.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.600
And I just wondered
why you did it.

22:20.602 --> 22:22.435
Oh, come on,
you know why.

22:22.437 --> 22:24.070
I was getting
complaints about you.

22:24.072 --> 22:26.239
Customers are never happy.

22:26.241 --> 22:27.240
You yelled at them.

22:27.242 --> 22:28.691
And you scared
your co-workers.

22:28.693 --> 22:31.661
They thought you
were seeing things half the time.

22:31.663 --> 22:34.063
Just like you are now.

22:34.065 --> 22:35.748
What are you even
looking at?

22:35.750 --> 22:37.750
It's unsettling.

22:37.752 --> 22:40.169
We were worried about you.

22:40.171 --> 22:42.038
It's not that
you're a bad person,

22:42.040 --> 22:45.592
but this just isn't
the right place for you, Carl.

22:45.594 --> 22:49.078
I'm sure there's another job
you'd be much happier doing.

22:49.080 --> 22:53.049
You've always been
envious of me, haven't you?

22:53.051 --> 22:54.550
I threaten you in some way.

22:54.552 --> 22:56.686
Okay, whatever.

22:56.688 --> 22:59.222
Look, you're gonna
have to go.

23:02.266 --> 23:04.217
He came forward when he saw
our statement to the media.

23:04.219 --> 23:07.169
Someone paid him 200 bucks
to bring Barry Flynn out of the bar

23:07.171 --> 23:08.638
into the parking lot.

23:10.086 --> 23:11.920
What happened
in the parking lot?

23:11.922 --> 23:13.755
I don't know. I told
Flynn to wait for me,

23:13.757 --> 23:16.091
that I left my keys in the bar
and that I'd be right back.

23:16.093 --> 23:17.225
Was that part of the plan?

23:17.227 --> 23:20.461
Yeah. But I never came
back outside again, so--

23:20.463 --> 23:22.931
Now, you said the guy
that paid you was a little weird.

23:22.933 --> 23:23.965
How so?

23:23.967 --> 23:25.900
He couldn't look at me
when he talked,

23:25.902 --> 23:28.486
and he kept yapping
about a magnificent light.

23:36.279 --> 23:37.996
I got 'em.

23:37.998 --> 23:41.032
Ha. Transcripts
of the calls I handled

23:41.034 --> 23:42.617
and the customers'
addresses.

23:42.619 --> 23:44.652
Let me go.

23:44.654 --> 23:47.539
You gotta let me go, Carl.

23:47.541 --> 23:50.625
Oh, no, no, no.
No, we're just getting started.

23:50.627 --> 23:52.877
Do you remember
how I said how I felt alive,

23:52.879 --> 23:55.130
like electricity
was coursing through me?

23:55.132 --> 23:57.799
Well, I felt this way
once before when I was 10.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.333
I had this dream
that I was a superhero,

23:59.335 --> 24:02.887
and I had this partner,
and together we killed evil people

24:02.889 --> 24:04.389
with this powerful knife.

24:04.391 --> 24:07.142
Well, I'm going to kill
these evil people.

24:08.729 --> 24:11.146
Help! Somebody, help!

24:11.148 --> 24:13.681
Aah! Damn it!

24:13.683 --> 24:15.450
Why do you keep
resisting me?!

24:15.452 --> 24:17.535
You awoke this gift
in me.

24:17.537 --> 24:20.071
You of all people
should understand

24:20.073 --> 24:22.523
that we have to do
this mission together.

24:22.525 --> 24:25.560
Why was there so much overkill
on the two victims?

24:25.562 --> 24:27.212
They were threats
to the unsub's

24:27.214 --> 24:29.530
imaginary relationship
with Flynn.

24:29.532 --> 24:31.966
They hardly knew Flynn.
I mean, at least 4 other people

24:31.968 --> 24:32.923
had private meetings with him.

24:32.948 --> 24:34.703
He gave autographs
to at least a dozen others.

24:34.704 --> 24:36.087
Why those two?

24:36.089 --> 24:37.705
Well, it's not reality based.

24:37.707 --> 24:41.059
His delusional mind exaggerated
the relationships they had with Flynn.

24:41.061 --> 24:42.543
Maybe he's not driven
by jealousy.

24:42.545 --> 24:44.016
What if the overkill

24:44.041 --> 24:45.860
was to make doubly sure
that they were dead

24:46.149 --> 24:47.816
and couldn't come back
to life?

24:47.818 --> 24:50.351
The way you'd want to kill
a monster in a horror movie.

24:50.353 --> 24:52.103
Exactly. Maybe
he saw them as evil.

24:52.105 --> 24:55.657
That could explain
the messages on the wall.

25:01.497 --> 25:03.031
Where are we?

25:03.033 --> 25:05.200
Janet Dodd's house.

25:05.202 --> 25:09.737
She's evil and
we need to stop her.

25:09.739 --> 25:12.707
Carl, you're making
a big mistake.

25:12.709 --> 25:16.010
I'm just doing what you told me to.
I'm taking action.

25:16.012 --> 25:17.962
You misunderstood me.

25:17.964 --> 25:20.081
Now stop this
before it's too late.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.100
You do not want blood
on your hands.

25:23.586 --> 25:24.719
What's so funny?!

25:24.721 --> 25:27.722
You are. I've already
killed two already.

25:27.724 --> 25:29.390
It's been in the news.

25:34.596 --> 25:38.700
Okay, she's alone now.

25:38.702 --> 25:41.319
Tell the police
if you think she's evil.

25:41.321 --> 25:44.706
No, no, no. The police
won't do a damn thing.

25:44.708 --> 25:46.651
No, I was in a bar once
and I saw a guy who was

25:46.676 --> 25:48.327
the epitome of evil,

25:48.328 --> 25:50.578
and I called the police
to tell them,

25:50.580 --> 25:52.163
and they hung up on me.

25:52.165 --> 25:54.799
And then 6 hours later,
a mother and her baby were killed

25:54.801 --> 25:56.417
when someone
tried to carjack them.

25:56.419 --> 25:57.919
And I know it was him.

25:58.954 --> 26:02.223
I could have saved them.

26:02.225 --> 26:05.026
Don't worry. You just watch.

26:05.978 --> 26:07.145
Ready?

26:07.147 --> 26:12.133
♪ You can tell me
I'm not the one ♪

26:12.135 --> 26:17.772
♪ I know the sun
is shining somewhere ♪

26:17.774 --> 26:24.746
♪ on someone,
it's only me, baby... ♪

26:27.751 --> 26:29.317
No!
Aah!

26:38.884 --> 26:41.668
"Hear your red,

26:41.670 --> 26:43.637
see your red."

26:43.639 --> 26:46.523
Well, somehow
it makes sense to him.

26:46.525 --> 26:48.309
The unsub
is clearly devolving.

26:48.311 --> 26:49.643
Yeah, the letters
are shakier.

26:49.645 --> 26:52.479
This message is less
controlled than the others.

26:52.481 --> 26:55.065
I agree. The word "evil"
was replaced by "red,"

26:55.067 --> 26:57.451
which means "red" could have been
from his unconscious,

26:57.453 --> 26:58.702
a freudian slip,
so to speak.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.821
But what does it mean?
Is it something specific

27:00.823 --> 27:02.039
to this victim?

27:02.041 --> 27:04.191
Janet Dodd. Got divorced
two years ago,

27:04.193 --> 27:06.410
she lived here alone,
worked as a paralegal.

27:06.412 --> 27:08.528
Any known enemies?
Perhaps the ex-husband?

27:08.530 --> 27:11.632
Uh, not according to her sister.
The husband left Janet.

27:11.634 --> 27:13.334
Any connection
to Flynn?

27:13.336 --> 27:15.419
Doesn't seem to be.
In fact her sister

27:15.421 --> 27:17.087
was trying to get her
to move on with her life,

27:17.089 --> 27:18.889
but Janet seemed
completely unmotivated.

27:18.891 --> 27:21.692
The unsub didn't pick her because
of her connection to Flynn, then.

27:21.694 --> 27:22.926
Then why did he choose her?

27:22.928 --> 27:25.312
Somehow their paths
must have crossed.

27:25.314 --> 27:26.780
Well, she didn't get out much.

27:26.782 --> 27:28.849
Only went to work
and then back home.

27:28.851 --> 27:31.435
We're pulling her phone records,
see who she talked to last.

27:31.437 --> 27:34.021
She's got a lot
of overdue bills.

27:34.023 --> 27:37.107
Uh, yeah, her sister said
she was struggling financially.

27:37.109 --> 27:40.494
She cut up a credit card
that wasn't expired. Why?

27:40.496 --> 27:43.280
People often do when they're
trying to rein in their spending.

27:43.282 --> 27:44.998
Psychologically it's harder
to part with cash.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.283
The phone logs.

27:46.285 --> 27:50.337
A lot of calls recently
to the same 800 number.

27:54.293 --> 27:57.795
Welcome to Luxor Bank cards.

28:01.266 --> 28:02.783
Ooh! Ooh.

28:02.785 --> 28:04.785
Hey, watch it, ese.

28:06.521 --> 28:08.472
What's your problem, man?

28:08.474 --> 28:10.757
You blind or something?

28:10.759 --> 28:11.758
Huh?

28:11.760 --> 28:13.894
You're lucky I'm busy today.

28:16.781 --> 28:18.315
Okay.

28:18.317 --> 28:20.200
There we go.

28:20.202 --> 28:21.268
There. Take a sip.

28:21.270 --> 28:22.703
Come on.
No.

28:22.705 --> 28:24.938
Come on, you'll feel
better. Come on.

28:24.940 --> 28:26.623
What do you want
with me, Carl?

28:26.625 --> 28:28.492
Isn't it obvious?

28:28.494 --> 28:29.827
We're partners.

28:29.829 --> 28:31.962
We're destined
to fight evil together.

28:31.964 --> 28:34.214
We're not p...

28:35.967 --> 28:38.035
When does the mission end?

28:38.037 --> 28:40.170
Mm. Never.

28:40.172 --> 28:41.922
This is only
the beginning.

28:41.924 --> 28:44.624
I don't think I realized
how serious you were, Carl.

28:44.626 --> 28:47.177
You really want to change
the world, don't you?

28:47.179 --> 28:49.513
You have the conviction
of a superhero.

28:49.515 --> 28:51.648
I believe that now.

28:51.650 --> 28:53.934
Come on, uncuff me.

28:53.936 --> 28:56.487
I won't run. I promise.

28:57.305 --> 28:59.189
When we got to
our next target.

29:00.676 --> 29:03.527
I knew you'd come around.

29:06.615 --> 29:07.748
Go ahead, Garcia.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.750
Okay, so I cross-referenced
Barry Flynn fans

29:09.752 --> 29:11.285
with people who had anger
management issues

29:11.287 --> 29:13.253
and Luxor Bank got one hit.

29:13.255 --> 29:15.389
Carl Finster. He worked
as a customer service rep

29:15.391 --> 29:16.557
at the call center there.

29:16.559 --> 29:17.875
He was fired 4 months ago.

29:17.877 --> 29:20.294
What are the chances that he
spoke to Janet Dodd on the phone?

29:20.296 --> 29:21.795
Oh, the chances are 100%,

29:21.797 --> 29:25.048
because she called that center
at least 20 times in the last year,

29:25.050 --> 29:27.734
and Carl answered
at least 3 of those calls.

29:27.736 --> 29:29.269
What was the anger
management issue?

29:29.271 --> 29:31.772
Oh, apparently one of his
co-workers filed a complaint

29:31.774 --> 29:34.391
after Carl got super mad
at her about God knows what

29:34.393 --> 29:36.193
and threatened her but good.

29:36.195 --> 29:39.279
He was fired a month later.
I am sending you his address now.

29:39.281 --> 29:41.114
Okay, so getting fired
was his stressor,

29:41.116 --> 29:42.900
and Barry Flynn's seminar
was his trigger somehow.

29:42.902 --> 29:44.684
If he's stalking
credit card customers,

29:44.686 --> 29:46.236
we need to find out
who he spoke to.

29:46.238 --> 29:46.893
A good point.

29:46.918 --> 29:48.856
Take Blake and Reid
and go to the workplace.

29:48.857 --> 29:51.542
The rest of us will go
to the house. Let's go.

29:51.544 --> 29:53.460
Some of his co-workers
thought he was mentally ill.

29:53.462 --> 29:56.296
When someone suggested
he get help, he went off,

29:56.298 --> 29:58.165
practically threatened
to kill her.

29:58.167 --> 29:59.366
What did you think?

29:59.368 --> 30:00.834
Something wasn't right.

30:00.836 --> 30:02.636
I mean, you'd be
talking to him

30:02.638 --> 30:04.421
and he wouldn't even
be looking at you.

30:04.423 --> 30:05.923
He'd be looking
around you.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.474
Was it like
he was hallucinating?

30:07.476 --> 30:09.977
Yeah. He started getting
weird with the customers

30:09.979 --> 30:12.513
and going off script,
and, you know,

30:12.515 --> 30:14.147
I had to fire him.

30:14.149 --> 30:16.266
Going off script
in what ways?

30:16.268 --> 30:19.603
We have a set
algorithm of questions

30:19.605 --> 30:21.772
depending on what
the customer's calling about.

30:21.774 --> 30:25.108
We review transcripts regularly,
and Carl was perfectly fine

30:25.110 --> 30:27.778
with some customers.
But with others,

30:27.780 --> 30:30.864
he'd be verbally abusive
for no reason.

30:34.536 --> 30:35.536
Clear.

30:35.538 --> 30:37.955
It's clear!

30:38.873 --> 30:40.340
There's nobody here.

30:40.342 --> 30:43.877
Hey, you guys,
look at this knife.

30:46.431 --> 30:50.000
Is this who Carl Finster
thinks he is?

30:51.586 --> 30:53.470
Why does my card
keep getting rejected?

30:53.472 --> 30:55.355
I've been paying the
minimum balance on time.

30:55.357 --> 30:57.724
You were 5 days late
in your April payment,

30:57.726 --> 30:59.526
so you're a liar.

30:59.528 --> 31:01.612
What? Did you
just call me a liar?

31:01.614 --> 31:03.814
I know who you are,
Howard Jephson.

31:03.816 --> 31:05.432
I can see your words.

31:05.434 --> 31:07.401
Okay, you know what?
I want to talk to your supervisor.

31:07.403 --> 31:10.320
You are rotten to the core!
You don't deserve any more credit!

31:10.322 --> 31:12.306
See what I was dealing with?

31:12.308 --> 31:15.242
Carl was attacking
certain customers for no reason.

31:15.244 --> 31:16.910
Why did he come back
last night?

31:16.912 --> 31:20.080
Well, at first I thought he came here
to shoot up the place.

31:20.082 --> 31:23.500
But now I think it was
to steal the recordings of his calls.

31:23.502 --> 31:26.053
We confirmed
he downloaded a file.

31:26.055 --> 31:28.138
Wait a minute, guys. He told
the caller he could see his words.

31:28.140 --> 31:30.974
And you said he acted
like he was hallucinating?

31:30.976 --> 31:33.260
I think I might know
what's wrong with him.

31:33.262 --> 31:35.629
He has synesthesia.
It's a neurological phenomenon

31:35.631 --> 31:38.148
in which two or more senses
are triggered simultaneously.

31:38.150 --> 31:41.635
For instance, someone might
associate specific numbers with colors

31:41.637 --> 31:42.819
or even be able
to taste music.

31:42.821 --> 31:45.138
I think Carl has
the form of synesthesia

31:45.140 --> 31:47.858
in which he can literally see the words
that people are speaking.

31:47.860 --> 31:50.994
Hence the message he left--
"hear your evil, see your evil."

31:50.996 --> 31:53.697
It looks like he transcribed
conversations he had with people

31:53.699 --> 31:55.198
in different colors of ink.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.700
Green, orange, red.

31:56.702 --> 31:58.502
Well, these are not
happy conversations.

31:58.504 --> 32:00.003
Reid, we can see here
that each of the colors

32:00.005 --> 32:01.154
mean something different
to him.

32:01.156 --> 32:03.206
White words mean
the speaker is good.

32:03.208 --> 32:04.708
It looks like
the orange ink

32:04.710 --> 32:06.176
means the speaker's
a liar.

32:06.178 --> 32:08.095
You know, maybe he sees people's
word in different colors

32:08.097 --> 32:10.681
depending on what type of person
he thinks they are.

32:10.683 --> 32:12.799
What's the content
of the red ones?

32:12.801 --> 32:15.969
Oh, they're angry.
He accuses them of being evil.

32:15.971 --> 32:19.005
And so he sees their words
in red. "Hear your red, see your red."

32:19.007 --> 32:21.141
He might believe
it's a super power.

32:21.143 --> 32:23.843
It looks like he tried
to stop the synesthesia

32:23.845 --> 32:26.012
by wearing tinted glasses.

32:26.014 --> 32:29.199
The fact is, we know his latest victim
was a customer he spoke to.

32:29.201 --> 32:31.568
His old boss says
he came in last night

32:31.570 --> 32:33.019
and stole a copy
of the recordings.

32:33.021 --> 32:36.356
The only reason is to compile
a list of people he considers evil.

32:36.358 --> 32:37.857
Exactly. The hit list.

32:37.859 --> 32:40.927
And he's got all their addresses
and vital information.

32:47.753 --> 32:50.170
Get in the house, now.

32:50.172 --> 32:52.706
Oh, my God.
You're the guy on the news.

32:52.708 --> 32:53.724
Do as he says.

32:53.726 --> 32:56.393
Get in the house!

32:57.428 --> 32:59.212
Shut up!
Aah!

32:59.214 --> 33:02.399
Howard Jephson, I know
who you really are.

33:02.401 --> 33:03.984
I'm not Howard Jephson.

33:03.986 --> 33:06.987
No games. Not if you want
your family to live.

33:06.989 --> 33:09.356
I'm telling you the truth.
We're just renting the house.

33:09.358 --> 33:11.658
My name is Stephen Caldwell.

33:11.660 --> 33:12.784
We never even met Howard.

33:12.809 --> 33:14.761
We just saw his name
on the lease agreement.

33:15.748 --> 33:17.564
We made a mistake.
Let's go.

33:17.566 --> 33:20.701
Look, if you leave now,
we won't call the police.

33:22.170 --> 33:23.954
Ohh!

33:26.040 --> 33:27.758
Carl, what the hell!

33:27.760 --> 33:29.242
He lied to us.

33:29.244 --> 33:30.910
His words turned orange.

33:30.912 --> 33:32.763
Now, hand me the knife.

33:32.765 --> 33:34.381
It's the wrong guy.

33:34.383 --> 33:35.766
I said hand me the knife!

33:35.768 --> 33:38.018
Okay. Give me the gun.

33:38.020 --> 33:41.521
Wait. Say that again.

33:41.523 --> 33:44.775
Give me the gun.

33:55.477 --> 33:57.797
He's got 150 names
in the Seattle area.

33:57.863 --> 33:59.429
He could be going after
any one of them.

33:59.431 --> 34:02.249
Garcia, any way to narrow it
down to callers in the city.

34:02.251 --> 34:03.900
Okay, that gives us 32.

34:03.902 --> 34:05.902
Was Janet Dodd
the first name alphabetically

34:05.904 --> 34:06.936
of those 32?

34:06.938 --> 34:08.371
No, she was the ninth.

34:08.373 --> 34:09.873
So he's not going
alphabetically.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.507
How else would you
organize a hit list?

34:11.510 --> 34:12.989
Maybe time a contact.

34:13.014 --> 34:14.962
He started with the first
person he spoke to.

34:14.963 --> 34:18.415
No, because he talked to Janet
Dodd the last day he was employed.

34:18.417 --> 34:20.350
He's going in reverse order.
The ones he talked to most recently

34:20.351 --> 34:21.751
would be freshest
in his mind.

34:21.753 --> 34:23.637
Garcia, take the last
callers and find out

34:23.639 --> 34:25.639
which ones live closest
to Janet Dodd.

34:25.641 --> 34:28.158
Okay, I got two names that are
about the same distance from her.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.509
Ranga Patel and Howard Jephson.

34:29.511 --> 34:31.094
All right, you two take Blake
and go to Howard Jephson.

34:31.096 --> 34:32.962
The rest of us will go
to the Patel house.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.022
How did you do that?

34:37.023 --> 34:37.989
Do what?

34:37.991 --> 34:40.158
How did you hide
your true nature

34:40.159 --> 34:41.358
for so long?

34:41.360 --> 34:43.377
Enough, Carl.
Listen to me.

34:43.379 --> 34:45.379
Listen to me carefully.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.364
You are not a victim
of circumstance.

34:47.366 --> 34:49.750
You are a creature
of free will.

34:49.752 --> 34:51.368
Take the right action.

34:51.370 --> 34:53.054
Let this family go.

34:54.591 --> 34:56.224
No one goes anywhere.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.676
I know that you don't
feel in control right now.

34:58.678 --> 34:59.894
You don't know how
you ended up here,

34:59.896 --> 35:02.713
and it feels like
there's no way out.

35:02.715 --> 35:05.266
But there is a way out.
I can help you.

35:05.268 --> 35:09.487
You think I'll believe
anything you say anymore?

35:11.056 --> 35:13.407
You and I have
a special bond, Carl.

35:13.409 --> 35:14.909
I know this isn't you.

35:14.911 --> 35:19.113
You don't know anything
about me.

35:19.115 --> 35:21.165
Aah!

35:23.452 --> 35:25.419
Aah...

35:25.421 --> 35:28.906
FBI! Drop it!

35:28.908 --> 35:30.875
He's evil! I can see it.

35:30.877 --> 35:32.460
All right, come on,
let's go.

35:32.462 --> 35:35.513
We know what's going on,
Carl.

35:35.515 --> 35:38.799
You've had a special talent
your whole life, haven't you?

35:39.935 --> 35:41.435
It's my gift.

35:41.437 --> 35:44.088
Barry Flynn here
unleashed that, Carl.

35:44.090 --> 35:47.058
How can you hurt a man
who's given you so much?

35:47.060 --> 35:48.759
He changed!

35:48.761 --> 35:49.860
I saw red.

35:49.862 --> 35:52.930
What do you see
when we speak?

35:52.932 --> 35:54.949
We know that you called
the police last year,

35:54.951 --> 35:57.318
and you warned them
about a man.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.371
They ignored me.

36:00.373 --> 36:03.374
They ignored me
and then he killed a mother

36:03.376 --> 36:05.109
and her baby.

36:05.111 --> 36:06.443
It wasn't him.

36:06.445 --> 36:08.879
The man you warned them
about was questioned,

36:08.881 --> 36:10.081
but it wasn't him.

36:10.083 --> 36:12.300
They found the real
killer a week later

36:12.302 --> 36:13.918
and he confessed.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.756
Carl, your gift
is not reliable.

36:18.758 --> 36:22.393
It's just a reflection on how
you feel about other people,

36:22.395 --> 36:25.129
but, Carl, it's not
who they really are.

36:25.131 --> 36:26.931
If you kill this man,

36:26.933 --> 36:29.650
you'll be destroying
a magnificent light.

36:31.820 --> 36:33.771
Think about it.

36:37.976 --> 36:40.027
Put the weapons down.

36:53.008 --> 36:55.009
"The mystery
of human existence

36:55.011 --> 36:57.295
"lies not in just
staying alive,

36:57.297 --> 37:00.164
but in finding
something to live for."

37:00.166 --> 37:03.517
Fyodor Dostoevsky.

37:08.840 --> 37:09.974
Hey.

37:09.976 --> 37:12.009
I encourage you
not to be mad at me.

37:12.011 --> 37:14.028
I did a little research
about Jason Ryder,

37:14.030 --> 37:16.731
and I found out that he was your
father's old partner

37:16.733 --> 37:18.349
at the Chicago P.D.,
so I'm assuming

37:18.351 --> 37:20.117
that there was some sort
of falling out?

37:20.119 --> 37:22.320
No, Garcia.

37:22.322 --> 37:26.023
Jason moved to New York
after my father died.

37:26.025 --> 37:29.794
He was a hero on 9/11.
That's why he's being honored.

37:29.796 --> 37:31.445
So what's the problem?

37:34.166 --> 37:36.834
Years ago, I was supposed
to talk about my father

37:36.836 --> 37:40.254
at the fallen
law enforcement memorial.

37:40.256 --> 37:43.641
I got up to the podium,
then I froze.

37:43.643 --> 37:44.792
You had stage fright.

37:44.794 --> 37:46.894
No. It wasn't that at all.

37:46.896 --> 37:48.482
Well, there's the obvious remedy,
which is imagining

37:48.507 --> 37:49.598
the whole audience naked,

37:49.599 --> 37:52.266
but you could imagine
a whole audience full of unsubs.

37:52.268 --> 37:54.101
You're really good
at talking down an unsub.

37:54.103 --> 37:56.654
Baby girl,
it wasn't stage fright.

37:59.408 --> 38:03.611
I wasn't ready to discuss
my feelings about my father in public.

38:03.613 --> 38:05.446
And you think talking
about his partner

38:05.448 --> 38:07.481
is going to bring up
those feelings?

38:07.483 --> 38:12.670
How can I honor Jason Ryder
when I couldn't honor my own father?

38:12.672 --> 38:14.839
It's disrespectful.

38:15.907 --> 38:18.409
Okay, this is gonna start out
sounding really harsh,

38:18.411 --> 38:20.261
but you need
to get over it.

38:20.263 --> 38:23.297
You need to let it go.
That is so far past.

38:23.299 --> 38:25.933
You've gotta stop beating
yourself up about this.

38:25.935 --> 38:29.136
That's not gonna happen,
is it?

38:29.138 --> 38:31.389
Okay.

38:31.391 --> 38:33.190
Well, then this, uh,

38:33.192 --> 38:35.609
this gift
is totally pointless.

38:35.611 --> 38:39.480
It's just some stuff
from Barry Flynn.

38:39.482 --> 38:41.565
I talked to him
about your issue,

38:41.567 --> 38:44.235
and he gave you another incentive
as a thank-you.

38:44.237 --> 38:46.237
You only have it
for 24 hours.

38:46.239 --> 38:48.038
So...

38:54.329 --> 38:56.297
Mm-hmm.

39:06.224 --> 39:08.342
A policeman
pulled over a man,

39:08.344 --> 39:11.262
and he said to him,
"Sir, your eyes look bloodshot.

39:11.264 --> 39:12.763
Have you been drinking?"

39:12.765 --> 39:15.399
And that man replied,

39:15.401 --> 39:19.320
"Officer,
your eyes look glazed.

39:19.322 --> 39:21.489
Have you been eating doughnuts?"

39:23.659 --> 39:26.193
You see, that right there
was the last joke

39:26.195 --> 39:27.695
that my father ever told me

39:27.697 --> 39:29.980
before he died.

39:32.534 --> 39:35.286
A special gift in my life

39:35.288 --> 39:37.788
are the 11 years
that I did have with him.

39:37.790 --> 39:41.175
Because as brief
as they may have been,

39:41.177 --> 39:45.262
my dad gave me
unconditional love.

39:45.264 --> 39:48.332
He taught me
a sense of duty.

39:48.334 --> 39:51.519
And he gave me a reason
to keep working hard.

39:51.521 --> 39:54.221
Because each and every day,
I do all that I know how to do

39:54.223 --> 39:55.723
to make my father proud.

39:55.725 --> 39:59.560
Now, my dad was taken from
this world way too soon.

39:59.562 --> 40:03.364
But if he wasn't, I wouldn't be
the man that I am today.

40:03.366 --> 40:06.233
Now, you may be wondering
why I'm talking about him here.

40:06.235 --> 40:08.018
It's because my father,

40:08.020 --> 40:11.688
the man that
I admire the most...

40:11.690 --> 40:16.193
Looked up to Mr. Jason Ryder,
who we honor here tonight.

40:16.195 --> 40:19.914
Jason was the most important
person in my father's life

40:19.916 --> 40:21.966
outside of his family.

40:21.968 --> 40:24.385
He was his partner
and his best friend.

40:24.387 --> 40:29.256
Like my father, Jason strived
to be the best he could be.

40:29.258 --> 40:31.809
He inspired me
to be fearless

40:31.811 --> 40:35.429
and to go out into the world
and find my inner light.

40:35.431 --> 40:39.183
And for that, Jason, I am
eternally grateful to you.

40:50.495 --> 40:53.948
No, please. Please don't.
Please don't! Please!

40:53.950 --> 40:54.949
No, no, no!

40:54.951 --> 40:57.668
No, please! Please don't!

40:57.670 --> 40:59.703
Please!
