00:01.839 --> 00:04.240
This lady has come
to pay Mrs. Quigley's fine.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.320
You're still sucking honey
from her fingers!

00:13.640 --> 00:15.000
Persephone, let me have you.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.480
I won't be your mistress.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.320
Lucy, the bastard
that killed her.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.040
I want so much to put
my faith in you, Charlotte.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.640
Then do so.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.920
You freed the devil.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.800
Everything we are
we owe to Lydia Quigley.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.160
Six months in jail
would not have avenged that.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.000
lt is not money I require,

00:33.080 --> 00:35.080
but introductions.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.320
I'm here to see
that this establishment

00:37.400 --> 00:39.560
does not continue
trading as a bawdy house.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.840
How dare that insect Hunt
and his constables

01:20.920 --> 01:23.560
prevent me from doing
business in my house!

01:23.680 --> 01:25.760
I don't mind a fight,

01:25.840 --> 01:27.640
I quite enjoy one,

01:27.680 --> 01:30.480
but what galls me
is having to retreat.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.560
Where are we going,
Mrs. Quigley?

01:32.680 --> 01:34.560
To my old friend, Mrs. May.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.320
Mrs. Wells.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.200
I have it on good authority
that this is a bawdy house.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.280
I'm here to conduct a search.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.256
That was quite a spectacle
you instigated

01:57.280 --> 01:58.280
at the flogging.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.560
Nothing compared to yours.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.560
My children.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.280
Their fathers?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.840
No business of yours.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.440
Miss Lambert.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.160
Let down by her socalled love.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.600
And that empty bed over there

02:25.680 --> 02:27.240
belonged to Miss Carter.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.560
Remember her?

02:28.680 --> 02:30.280
Poor, murdered Miss Carter.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.720
And equip us for the challenges

02:35.840 --> 02:38.520
that we shall face.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.400
Justice Hunt.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.080
My newest tenants.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.360
See? No culls here.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.680
I let out lodgings,
as you can see.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.280
For the needy and the sick.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.000
What drives your concern,
I wonder.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.680
Pity?

03:10.720 --> 03:11.960
Or guilt?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.280
We found this in Kitty's hair.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.120
It's from a rich man's garment.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.680
If you find that garment,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.440
you'll find her killer.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.680
It is indeed a tragedy.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.880
A young tenant slain

03:33.000 --> 03:36.800
and then flung upon the steps
of your blameless house.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.360
It must make you
doubt your business.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.120
Good day.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.120
He's a cunt.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.240
Didn't even bring me
any flowers.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.120
Tried to catch us in the act.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.080
Of what?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.560
I haven't had a decent fuck
since I've been here.

04:04.280 --> 04:09.720
You were wonderful as always.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.120
Thank you so much.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.560
Um, I'll take two of those,
please.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.160
You can have one.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.120
Two guineas or you're out.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.840
Then we'll leave.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.000
One guinea for now
and we'll see how you go.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.800
Get up!

04:41.920 --> 04:44.600
We need to earn.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.920
I'm already up.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.800
Care to take a seat?

04:48.920 --> 04:50.920
I'm not giving it away anymore.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.400
Mumma's money's gone.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.600
I'm going to talk to her.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.600
Don't go near her.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.240
Just go and get us some girls,

05:00.360 --> 05:03.120
some hoitytoity, tits up there,

05:03.160 --> 05:05.800
something different.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.720
And while you're at it,

05:10.800 --> 05:12.480
tell the world
the Duchess of Quim

05:12.560 --> 05:15.000
is bestowing her favors again.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.680
You're the bawd, not the whore!

05:19.720 --> 05:22.480
No culls for you.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.680
Then do as Mother Lacey says,

05:24.720 --> 05:27.280
get me some girls to boss about.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.480
Are you leaving?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.240
I want to go home.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.240
Pick my scabs in peace.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.240
Who's Persephone, Nance?

05:44.360 --> 05:45.360
She's the stupid slut

05:45.400 --> 05:48.360
who ate the fruit of hell.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.720
What happened to her?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.680
She got trapped in hell.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.600
Her mother tried to rescue her.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.160
Why?

05:57.240 --> 06:00.800
Lord Fallon keeps calling me it.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.120
Fancies himself as Hades,
does he?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
I've had a couple of them.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.360
And a few Lucifers.

06:09.400 --> 06:13.400
He still wants to be my keeper.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.680
Well, humor him
or put a stop to it.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.600
Either way, you make sure

06:20.720 --> 06:23.400
you're the one in control.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.160
There's two more
than you told me.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.840
Sturdy girls too.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.160
I'll have to charge you
an extra guinea.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.800
We agreed the price.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.720
But the extra coal
and the candles.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.360
I want you to be comfortable
in your hour of need.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.120
You're so thoughtful.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.920
I only have a few rules, girls.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.240
No orgies, flagellation,
or bestiality.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.240
Otherwise, you are at liberty

07:09.280 --> 07:13.040
to entertain gentleman callers
as you wish.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.840
I'll have to play draughts
with 'em then.

07:15.920 --> 07:20.120
You're a brazen thing,
aren't you?

07:20.160 --> 07:23.280
You remember the
darkhaired girl I cared for?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.720
Charlotte Wells?

07:25.800 --> 07:27.920
Wells.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.160
Of course!

07:30.240 --> 07:32.800
Little Maggie's girl.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.040
Nance? I need a drink.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.480
I'm taking you home.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.120
Come on.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.720
How have I come to this?

08:04.560 --> 08:05.720
Who is she?

08:09.120 --> 08:12.920
She was a special friend
of my father.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.560
I seem unable to escape her.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.120
I didn't think her your friend.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.600
You have taste.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.600
Charlotte, what would
I have done without you

08:27.720 --> 08:29.280
these past days?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.520
You must visit
Lady Isabella again.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.480
She is the key
that will reopen Golden Square,

08:38.600 --> 08:41.360
she and her friends.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.360
We must win them...

08:43.480 --> 08:44.960
to our side.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.720
You sure you're gonna
be all right?

09:19.840 --> 09:23.000
You fret like an old crone.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.200
I'm worried about you
on your own.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.480
We're born alone, die alone.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.960
Some of us like it
that way in between.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.240
Now, piss off
or fetch a glass and join me.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.520
When are you gonna
fix things with Mags?

09:54.480 --> 09:56.120
What are you gonna do?

09:56.240 --> 09:57.960
That's up to her, isn't it?

10:05.720 --> 10:08.640
To mark the end of your ordeal.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.320
I only wish you had
called on me.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.320
You wouldn't have
paid a penny, nor would I.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.760
ln truth, no.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.600
Debts irritate friendship
like fleas in a wig.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.240
And when you have fallen
as low as you have,

10:24.360 --> 10:26.000
you need friends.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.520
Prison, Lydia.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.840
Charlotte has been
like a daughter to me.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.720
But her mother,

10:35.760 --> 10:39.000
she still thwarts you?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.840
Like a fly I cannot swat.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.000
...

10:43.120 --> 10:45.000
I saved her as a child

10:45.080 --> 10:46.480
and yet she seeks to punish me

10:46.600 --> 10:48.600
for corrupting
some imagined innocence.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.360
But children aren't innocent.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.640
No!

10:53.720 --> 10:55.120
I knew how to please Father

10:55.240 --> 10:59.120
when I was still an infant.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.120
It was the making of me.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.960
I will spare you the discomfort

11:19.000 --> 11:22.320
of making demands of me.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.120
Mrs. Quigley seeks
powerful associates.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.840
She is poison, you are nectar,

11:29.960 --> 11:33.080
so you have been sent
as her agent.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.000
You know her well.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.600
She is relentless.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.760
I will not have her
anywhere near my circle.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.440
Only you.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.360
Perhaps if you do this,

11:44.440 --> 11:46.720
I can help you be free.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.880
You promise the impossible.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I meant free from Mrs. Quigley.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.240
Do you court me as an ally?

11:55.360 --> 11:57.440
A friend.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.840
How forward.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.360
But true.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.320
lzzy, there you are.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.600
Miss Wells!

12:08.880 --> 12:10.840
Becoming a habit.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.720
As are your intrusions.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.240
Now, now, Izzy.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.816
We were always taught
to share our toys,

12:15.840 --> 12:17.760
weren't we?

12:17.840 --> 12:19.600
I am not a toy.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.960
Quite so.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.480
And I'm appalled
by my discourtesy.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.320
I prostrate myself in apology.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.000
Accepted.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.600
So long as you're not
trying to look up my skirts.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.440
Bravo.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.240
There are not many
who dare chastise

12:36.360 --> 12:38.520
my selfexalted sibling.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.080
Well, I can see I'm being
conspired against.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.440
I shall see you at
the Pleasure Gardens, my dear.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.840
Do I get an invite?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.240
Pleasure is my business.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.440
It's the last night
of the season.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.320
It would be a tragedy
if you missed it.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.120
Don't you think so, Izzy?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.080
A calamity.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.600
Well, then you must join us.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.720
You've got what you came for.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.360
Half the peerage
will be prowling

13:16.480 --> 13:19.000
the Pleasure Gardens tonight.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.440
Run and tell Mrs. Quigley.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.360
Betsey.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.320
My Betsey.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.480
Forgive me.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.480
I can be Betsey.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.720
It's Hannah if you're
looking for me again.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.640
Will you remember, Mr. Oswald?

14:28.240 --> 14:31.120
I can't do business
without a man on the door.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.360
It's your job,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
you need to come back and do it.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.840
I won't be your lackey.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.840
lt's your duty to provide.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.000
For Jacob and Lucy.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.200
 How much do you want?

14:45.240 --> 14:47.320
Don't fret.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.360
One man is more or less
the same as another.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.360
You looking for new girls too?

14:53.480 --> 14:54.760
I might be.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.080
I pull a peg better
than anyone in London.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.080
Culls will be queuing up,

14:59.120 --> 15:00.840
even if it is
a cursed death house.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.960
A what?
lt's just something I've heard.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.880
Nell.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.480
You'd do well at mine.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.080
Sorry, Mrs. Wells,

15:09.120 --> 15:11.440
maybe if you go a month
without a murder.

15:11.480 --> 15:15.440
Lucky for you,
I don't scare easy.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.720
Cherry, you're not
right for me.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.760
But I'll pay you sixpence

15:18.840 --> 15:20.880
for every girl you send 'round.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.840
And a shilling for
talking the house up.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.480
I'll do that,
till you see sense.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.840
Nancy?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.360
That's half the cow.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.360
You need your strength.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.240
You're a good girl, Charlotte.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.880
Glad someone thinks so.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.200
Sit down.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.720
Talk to me.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.440
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.200
You're going to bring
down Lydia Quigley.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.840
People will talk about it
for years to come.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.480
And your mother will thank you.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.760
Even if I have to twist
her nipples to make her.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.816
I'm trying to act
against Quigley

16:28.840 --> 16:32.240
yet I find myself
doing her bidding.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.480
Watch her with the men.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.720
Find those she feeds
with rape and murder.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.360
Rich men,

16:46.480 --> 16:48.360
who think they're untouchable.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.360
Should I just kill her?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.360
Kill her in the night
and be done?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.160
No, you're burning, girl.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.400
Don't let her sniff it.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.280
Don't let her slither
into your soul.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.079
You know you have to wait

17:16.200 --> 17:18.520
to truly make her suffer.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.560
Whoa.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.480
Miss Wells, may I tempt you
out for a drive?

17:33.560 --> 17:34.480
I'll come.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.720
You may, if she does not.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.160
Where to?

17:39.240 --> 17:40.880
Wherever you wish.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.040
I'm your servant.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.000
Your ma won't like it.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.280
My ma needn't know.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.880
You exalt my humble cart,

17:55.960 --> 17:57.920
dearest Persephone.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.680
Don't call me that.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.800
Ride on.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.800
My little cherub.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.480
How handsome you've become.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.400
Why are you here, Charles?

18:22.480 --> 18:25.040
They sent me
from Golden Square.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.200
I was worried about you.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.160
Ha.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.520
Your inheritance more like.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.760
No, it grieves me
that you two quarrel.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.280
Might I have a word
with my mother?

18:34.400 --> 18:37.440
Have some seed cake.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.680
Warm, plump,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.960
ready to eat.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.240
Just like me.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.440
You should have come
to stay with me, Mumma.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.760
And dear Emily?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.440
We're family.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.680
Who is this slut

18:58.720 --> 19:01.200
that's come between
you and your mother?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.160
You have need of
a soldier's jacket, lady?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.960
Saw three years' service,
fighting the French.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.680
Don't want a jacket.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.440
No, I have need of a soldier.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.080
When will you cease
your teasing?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.440
I can make another proposal

19:35.480 --> 19:37.800
and have it sent
to your mother today.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.720
You can negotiate with me.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.480
You are open to it?

19:42.520 --> 19:45.480
lf the terms suit.

19:45.520 --> 19:50.640
I agreed 400 a year before.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.240
Five hundred.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.760
You're a gauche girl.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.000
I would be your first keeper.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.960
There's much I can teach you.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.480
Four hundred is my limit.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.880
Can you teach me
how to drive the horse?

20:15.200 --> 20:17.160
Of course.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.640
It's quite simple, here.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.240
Take the reins in the palm
of each hand, thus.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.200
Try to get a feel
for the rhythm of the horse.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.320
Like this?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.400
Here?

20:37.240 --> 20:38.400
Are you scared?

20:38.480 --> 20:40.280
Morning, Fallon!

20:42.240 --> 20:44.520
lmmensely aroused.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.720
Five hundred a year.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.440
Five hundred.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.280
Fallon!

21:04.800 --> 21:06.240
God!

21:06.280 --> 21:07.560
Yes.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.160
I'll think about it.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.680
Walk on.

21:41.720 --> 21:42.800
Stop.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.320
Ten shillings for your services

21:46.440 --> 21:48.000
and ten for your silence.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.520
Yeah, but the job
isn't finished.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.000
lt is for me.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.920
 I am your rightful heir,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.720
not Charlotte Wells!

22:05.800 --> 22:07.720
You're my son and I love you

22:07.760 --> 22:09.440
and even though you betrayed me

22:09.480 --> 22:11.080
and called me a monster,

22:11.200 --> 22:15.960
I would change things
in your favor in an instant

22:16.000 --> 22:18.680
if you leave Emily Lacey.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.320
I love her.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.400
You're grotesque.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.560
They left at first light.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.160
The house has been empty
all day.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.920
The whole household left?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.800
Mrs. Quigley and her girls.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.000
You have something to say,
Miss Cross?

22:56.080 --> 22:58.200
She'll just trade
somewhere else.

22:58.240 --> 23:02.760
You won't shut
Mrs. Quigley down.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.680
I fear we may have done
the wrong thing, Mr. Oswald.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.680
I think you were right
to make an example, sir.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.760
These places are steeped in sin.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.080
The girls are wretched,

23:13.200 --> 23:14.760
the men are brutes.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.400
Beneath contempt.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.760
Miss Cross!

23:18.880 --> 23:20.920
You eat with a hypocrite, sir.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.776
I saw him this very day,
rutting on the street

23:22.800 --> 23:24.720
with one of his
"wretched girls."

23:24.760 --> 23:27.080
Do you deny this, Mr. Oswald?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.240
He fucked my poor friend Betsey
to the pox house.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.400
Violet, get out!

23:45.760 --> 23:47.640
What news, Mr. Holland?

23:47.720 --> 23:49.200
Miss Lacey.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.520
You were a vision before

23:50.640 --> 23:52.560
but now you're a dream
in human form.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.560
Such a scribe.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.240
Always using ten words
when one would do.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.000
I could use actions

23:59.080 --> 24:00.800
to show you how much
I've missed you.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.720
Something's already
stirring into action.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.960
Do me in.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Oi!

24:10.080 --> 24:12.480
Outta my seat.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.760
Let the man alone!

24:13.880 --> 24:15.520
I don't see another man here.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.920
More of a man than you.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.000
I fought in France
while you were at home

24:22.080 --> 24:23.680
scratching your bollocks.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.240
I've missed fighting
and I'll take you on.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.760
That's it! Go on!

24:47.880 --> 24:50.800
I'll offer evens
on the lad of my color.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.000
Twotoone on the big fella.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.240
Come on, bring it in.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.760
Come on! See that? See that?

25:16.080 --> 25:17.480
Bad luck, gentlemen.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.920
Sit a moment.

25:37.040 --> 25:41.400
How does a girl
end up in a bawdy house?

25:41.480 --> 25:43.480
I want to understand.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.240
It's not obvious?

25:46.320 --> 25:48.240
She needs money or food

25:48.280 --> 25:51.040
or some bastard's coming
for her with a mallet.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.280
How does it work?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.680
How are girls chosen?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.440
Cherry sent us.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.760
You've got to be halfdecent.

25:59.880 --> 26:00.880
Not a bunter.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.960
No. Sorry, no, love.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.200
Beyond that, each house
looks for something different.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.296
If the bawd likes
the look of you,

26:09.320 --> 26:10.400
she'll get you in...

26:10.480 --> 26:12.920
Out. ...look you over,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.640
check your bits are sound...

26:14.720 --> 26:15.800
Sorry, my love.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.080
No unwanted pets.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.320
...and then you'll be
fed, clothed,

26:20.440 --> 26:22.240
and given a bed.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.400
Then you'll be on your back

26:23.440 --> 26:24.456
from morning till midnight

26:24.480 --> 26:27.720
paying for it all.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.400
Why did you not seek
such an arrangement?

26:30.480 --> 26:33.080
'Cause I like my freedom.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.440
Thank God.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.720
He keeps talking to me.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.240
Miss Scanwell.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.880
I'm here for Violet's
reading lesson.

27:00.960 --> 27:05.480
I was surprised
to see you this morning.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.480
I would not have thought

27:06.520 --> 27:09.440
the Wells house

27:09.480 --> 27:11.200
a fitting place.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.920
Charity comes from
strange places.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.080
lt saddens me that
you're in need of charity.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.720
May I be of help?

27:18.760 --> 27:21.000
You do much already

27:21.040 --> 27:23.400
by allowing me to do

27:23.480 --> 27:26.000
the Lord's work with Violet.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.920
She feels me, sir,
feels my sin.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.240
Then I will leave you
in Miss Scanwell's good hands.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.440
What are you doing?

27:44.480 --> 27:47.040
I think it's time
I felt your sin.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.400
Come and try me dumplings!

28:03.480 --> 28:05.560
Lovely dumplings!

28:09.160 --> 28:12.080
Hello, little pixie.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.960
What world did you fall from?

28:15.000 --> 28:18.480
Fall on your face
for five shillings.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.040
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

28:20.160 --> 28:22.320
I was born fighting.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.000
Comes natural to a black boy

28:24.080 --> 28:25.880
raised in a white man's house.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.040
Here.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.280
That's half of what
I made on you.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.480
You didn't tell me
there was a book running.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.400
Next time, Nell.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.440
This young man
could make a lot of money.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.720
He's a born fighter.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.720
To feel firm fruit!

28:52.760 --> 28:54.480
Emily.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.280
There's no one like you.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.720
ln here, my dear.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.760
Charles. Harriet.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.240
Meet Cherry, our new girl.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.720
Isn't she marvelous?

29:06.760 --> 29:08.920
Where's Emily?
I think she's busy.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I wouldn't.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.696
My love, I have the
most wonderful surp

29:13.720 --> 29:14.920
Get out!

29:15.000 --> 29:17.240
I can't stop. Not you!

29:31.720 --> 29:33.680
It's just work.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.480
A guinea.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.000
You're priceless.

29:41.080 --> 29:46.520
And I'm late being paid,
so here is five...

29:46.640 --> 29:50.000
six shillings
and a piece of cheese.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.680
I told you I'd get culls.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.560
For a piece of cheese!

29:57.680 --> 29:59.560
Where are our girls then?

29:59.680 --> 30:02.800
I kept my end of the bargain.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.720
I found a jewel.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.680
Cherry Dorrington?

30:12.720 --> 30:15.080
I said different, not deflated.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.320
Fuck you, Emily Lacey.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.960
You know I blow a flute
better than anyone.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.560
You'll be lucky to have me.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.080
That's some claim.

30:25.200 --> 30:29.520
As Emily knows,
I always try the goods.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.760
Makes you feel better,
be my guest.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.000
I'll make him feel much better.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.680
Come on, Charlie.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.760
Don't scratch.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.640
You're a Greek Street
temptress now.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.640
Sorry, Mrs. Wells.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.400
I feel like a princess.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.440
You look like a peach.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.680
All right, come on, Fanny, Lucy.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.760
Go and get your best
and brightest dresses on.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.680
What for?

31:08.720 --> 31:11.040
Pleasure Gardens.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.160
I want to parade my new girls.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.920
What pleasure's to be had
with Kitty's passing?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.800
lt's work.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.920
So go and get ready.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.080
Ma?

31:24.200 --> 31:25.440
Ma!

31:25.480 --> 31:27.720
I need to speak to you.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.720
Lord Fallon's made me
another offer.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.560
A better one.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.480
It'll help you through
this difficult time.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.320
I thought you didn't
like Lord Fallon.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.640
You said you weren't ready.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.960
That was before.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.760
Get your dress on.

31:49.880 --> 31:50.960
I'm gonna show you off.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.240
He's sending for me tonight.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.080
You said yes?

31:58.480 --> 32:00.000
I don't want to be touted out

32:00.080 --> 32:01.480
like one of the girls.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.520
I want a better life for myself.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.800
So why are we
even discussing it?

32:11.920 --> 32:14.080
You made up your mind.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.000
Look at you.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.640
What a fine figure.

32:29.720 --> 32:33.520
I can see why men
want their mitts on it.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.280
What do you want?

32:35.400 --> 32:37.960
Just a quiet word, dear.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.560
I am so happy that you and Lydia

32:46.680 --> 32:50.040
have found each other again.

32:50.160 --> 32:54.640
She doted on you
as a child, doted.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.400
Your mother never did.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.880
Not the maternal kind, is she?

32:59.960 --> 33:02.480
Ambitious.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.720
Poor Lydia.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.480
Her heart was broken
when Little Maggie

33:07.520 --> 33:08.800
took you away.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.200
You've known Mrs. Quigley
a long time.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.520


33:14.640 --> 33:17.000
I remember her as a girl.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.760
What was she like?

33:21.880 --> 33:23.000
Obedient.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.880
How does an obedient girl
become a bawd?

33:27.960 --> 33:29.960
How do any of us, dear?

33:31.480 --> 33:32.640
I admire Lydia.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.440
And you.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.520
I want to be able to achieve
your kind of success.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.800
Be able to retire.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.200
How do I do it?

33:45.240 --> 33:47.400
But you're not like us...

33:49.400 --> 33:50.720
are you, dear?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.200
I don't know what you mean.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.680
You hurt Lydia...

33:59.720 --> 34:02.080
and I'll hurt you.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.200
Mrs. Wells.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.080
You've brought us to paradise.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.840
I never knew such places
like this existed.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.480
Heaven. Remember, girls,

35:26.520 --> 35:30.760
faces front, heads held high,

35:30.840 --> 35:34.320
and imagine you're one
of the fine ladies.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.920
Like them?

35:38.760 --> 35:40.120
Come on, Sukey.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.880
Mrs. May.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.520
Lydia.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.000
Go forth.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.920
Entice the wealthiest culls.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.960
Charlotte, you know what to do.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.120
Charlotte has an admirer.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.400
I've guessed your business
with my sister.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.000
So you've been
thinking about me?

37:34.040 --> 37:35.336
lt's not Hazard
you've been playing, is it?

37:35.360 --> 37:39.400
It's a game for girls only.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
A game of flats.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.040
What price for a taste

37:45.120 --> 37:47.640
of your oyster, Miss Wells?

37:50.480 --> 37:52.000
lf you want a whore,

37:52.040 --> 37:53.760
go and plunge on your mother.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.400
We should retire
somewhere more quiet.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.000
My rooms, perhaps.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.600
At least he asked
if I was for sale.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.760
Miss Wells.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.120
Let me offer you the sanctuary

38:09.200 --> 38:11.320
of some female company.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.920
I have every faith
Charlotte will secure me

38:24.000 --> 38:25.880
the friends I need

38:25.960 --> 38:28.760
to prevail over Justice Hunt

38:28.840 --> 38:31.600
and reopen Golden Square.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.440
You still here?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.400
I'm waiting to
discuss my terms.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.480
Go away, Cherry.
Give her a chance.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.160
This could be
a house where men come

38:44.280 --> 38:46.800
precisely for
something different.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.480
I'll work hard.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.000
Please, Emily.

38:50.080 --> 38:54.960
It's not safe out there.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.080
Five shillings for every turn.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.040
Rest goes to me for your bawd.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.040
I'd expect ten shillings
in a house like this.

39:02.120 --> 39:05.560
Half the size, half the money.

39:05.640 --> 39:06.840
And you, Harriet,

39:06.920 --> 39:08.280
you know you're on a good deal,

39:08.360 --> 39:09.480
so you'll do my books.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.840
No questions asked.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.000
Very well.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.600
My girls.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.200
I'm sorry.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.000
I probably shouldn't
touch your...

39:37.080 --> 39:39.000
No one else plays it.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.920
What are your ma's
hopes for you, then?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.280
I never thought.

39:46.880 --> 39:51.400
She'd want me to
rest in God's favor.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.280
And what do you want?

39:53.360 --> 39:56.120
I don't know.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.920
You?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.480
Money.

40:05.440 --> 40:09.200
I felt I must speak
to you after this morning.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.080
We are upstanding people,
Amelia and I.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.320
I hope you will not judge us

40:13.400 --> 40:15.480
by our current sanctuary.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.200
Mrs. Wells does not
strike me as a...

40:17.320 --> 40:20.800
Godly woman.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.600
She is not as bad as you think.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.000
There are worse,

40:25.080 --> 40:27.760
like the bawd Quigley.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.080
What dealings
have you had with her?

40:30.160 --> 40:32.880
Enough to know
that she is evil.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.160
A kidnapper of young girls.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.280
Who is the real monster,
Mrs. Scanwell?

40:38.360 --> 40:39.360
The kidnapper or the one

40:39.440 --> 40:41.600
who seeks to devour her prey?

40:41.680 --> 40:44.640
Both are inexcusable.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.400
You must pursue them
with equal vigor.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.880
Miss Cross,

40:52.960 --> 40:55.320
will you accompany
Mrs. Scanwell home?

41:07.320 --> 41:08.640
You need come no further.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.440
I'm used to finding
my way in the dark.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.000
Mr. Hunt asked me to.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.640
I have no desire
for your company.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.336
I don't know what hold
you have over Amelia,

41:16.360 --> 41:18.080
but I do not like it.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.480
Or you.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.480
I've done you a favor
this evening.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.200
What will you do for me?

42:07.320 --> 42:11.000
What would you have me do?

42:11.040 --> 42:15.000
It's quite simple, really.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.000
I want to destroy Lydia Quigley.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.880
So do I.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.960
So how do you propose to do it?

42:32.640 --> 42:36.520
Why do you think
I'm living with her?

42:36.600 --> 42:38.920
I'm waiting for my moment.

42:43.280 --> 42:47.000
Then we'll be allies.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.640
On one condition.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.960
Name it.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.960
That you have nothing to do
with my brother.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.960
Got the pox, does he?

43:02.440 --> 43:03.960
As you wish.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.280
They're having fun.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.040
And you?

43:25.200 --> 43:27.760
It's an empty place.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.080
It's a trick of the lights.

43:30.160 --> 43:34.000
To part shallow people
from their money.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.440
You all right, Mrs. Wells?

43:36.480 --> 43:38.760
Lucy's leaving.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.640
lsn't that what you wanted?

43:48.920 --> 43:50.760
Sort 'em out, Fanny.

44:04.360 --> 44:08.280
Little Maggie Wells.

44:08.360 --> 44:09.520
Now there's a face I thought

44:09.600 --> 44:11.360
would be rotting in hell by now.

44:11.440 --> 44:15.440
How you've grown
such lovely bosoms.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.080
Little Maggie.

44:20.160 --> 44:23.280
Never knew when to
keep quiet, did you?

44:23.360 --> 44:25.120
Blabbing to Hunt,

44:25.200 --> 44:28.120
slandering me
for the murder of your whore.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.640
She was quiet as a mouse

44:29.760 --> 44:32.760
when she had a cock
in her mouth.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.320
Do you still lick 'em
like lollipops?

44:36.800 --> 44:39.160
No, she gets her daughters
to do it now.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.160
 Say one more word

44:51.280 --> 44:53.960
and I'll rip
your fucking head off.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.920
Ma, what are you doing?

45:02.280 --> 45:04.200
For God's sake, Ma,
you'll ruin everything.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.440
Eviscerate her.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.480
Do you hear?

45:08.560 --> 45:10.080
For all of us.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.080
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.840
Gather the girls.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.040
This never happened.

45:27.120 --> 45:30.920
We must be seen
to be having fun.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.200
There's a carriage outside.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.880
Didn't want to go
without saying goodbye.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.960
You remember
you're a Wells woman.

46:10.960 --> 46:13.000
Don't be cowed by him.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.040
You'll be London's finest.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.960
Thank you, Ma.

46:25.480 --> 46:30.080
If he hurts you, in any way,

46:30.160 --> 46:31.800
I'll come for him.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.120
Charlotte!

47:27.200 --> 47:28.800
Anne will take care
of your friend.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.480
You have another visitor.

47:35.400 --> 47:37.080
I don't like my sister
having all the fun.

47:38.880 --> 47:40.360
Your Lordship.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.480
You know I choose my own culls.

47:47.520 --> 47:51.320
I would consider it
a great favor.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.560
His patronage will
reestablish Golden Square.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.320
He offers 50 guineas.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.960
I'm afraid
I was undersold, sir.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.336
A night here with me
cannot be bought

48:04.360 --> 48:06.040
for less than 100 guineas.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.480


48:07.560 --> 48:09.040
The greater the cost,

48:09.120 --> 48:11.880
the greater the anticipation.

48:11.960 --> 48:14.360
Would you be so kind
as to open an account for me?

48:14.440 --> 48:16.200
I'd consider it an honor.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.000
Good girl.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.760
lt seems like only yesterday

48:47.840 --> 48:49.520
Amelia was this small.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.000
And mine.

48:58.520 --> 49:02.280
How do you protect them when
you can't hold them anymore?

49:02.360 --> 49:04.440
We cannot.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.560
We can only trust them,
and pray for their souls

49:08.640 --> 49:11.000
to tread a righteous path,
of course.

49:13.760 --> 49:16.800
I punched Lydia Quigley
tonight.

49:19.080 --> 49:22.760
I hope you punched her hard.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.640
I knocked her down.

49:25.760 --> 49:27.640
There will be hell to pay.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.800
I will pray for you, Mrs. Wells.
