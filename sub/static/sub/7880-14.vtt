Do it again and this time
make me feel it.

00:46.472 --> 00:49.115
Hey, Toshi, my mom's taking
me to get ice cream.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.433
Want to come with?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.700
Hi, Akiko.

00:51.735 --> 00:53.035
Absolutely not!

00:53.070 --> 00:54.870
They're in music lessons.

00:54.905 --> 00:57.039
One of the many extra
curricular activities

00:57.074 --> 00:59.475
that will ensure their entry
into a top university.

00:59.509 --> 01:03.913
They have no time for treats,
or games, or bathroom breaks.

01:03.947 --> 01:07.650
(turns vacuum on)

01:07.684 --> 01:09.652
Oh, come on, Hiko.

01:09.686 --> 01:12.421
Let 'em have some fun;
college is years away.

01:12.456 --> 01:15.891
That attitude is why my children
will attend Harvard

01:15.926 --> 01:18.394
while Steve will be lucky
to be wait-listed

01:18.428 --> 01:21.113
at an online, offshore college.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.883
Oh, you whore.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.518
Check it out.
This is my impression

01:25.552 --> 01:28.170
of Scott Caan holding a violin.

01:28.205 --> 01:29.405
(giggles)

01:30.540 --> 01:32.425
(giggles, stops abruptly)

01:32.459 --> 01:33.859
Come on, Steve.

01:33.894 --> 01:37.480
Let's go get some ice cream
so you can enjoy life.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.815
Are you trying to say
my kids don't enjoy life?

01:39.850 --> 01:41.267
Show them fun!

01:41.301 --> 01:43.252
(playing classical music)

01:43.286 --> 01:44.253
Enough fun!

01:44.287 --> 01:45.454
(groans)

01:47.274 --> 01:48.924
And then she had the nerve

01:48.959 --> 01:52.311
to imply that my kid's not gonna
get into a decent college!

01:54.231 --> 01:56.415
<i>Bonjour, les Papas!</i>

01:57.417 --> 01:59.385
Libby's still doing baby talk?

01:59.419 --> 02:01.187
Francine, she's speaking French.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.822
We need her to be trilingual

02:02.856 --> 02:05.291
so she stands out from
the other applicants.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.492
For preschool?

02:06.526 --> 02:08.259
No, for college.
You gotta start early

02:08.294 --> 02:10.246
if your child is going
to be exceptional.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.248
It's the only way
to get into the Ivies.

02:12.282 --> 02:13.415
But don't worry, Francine.

02:13.450 --> 02:14.817
Hayley turned out fine.

02:14.851 --> 02:16.502
(laughing)

02:16.536 --> 02:19.855
You guys are both bitches!

02:19.890 --> 02:21.123
(door opens)

02:21.158 --> 02:24.827
Okay, we're tied at
200 games to 200 games.

02:24.861 --> 02:27.263
The winner of this will be
crowned badminton champion

02:27.297 --> 02:29.899
and receive the
coveted shuttlecock ring.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.867
(ding)

02:31.902 --> 02:33.369
Line judge, you ready?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.753
Ready.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.805
We've got to find
something you're good at

02:36.840 --> 02:39.408
so you can get into
a decent college!

02:39.442 --> 02:40.576
Now what?

02:40.610 --> 02:42.261
We need a line judge.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.629
(panting):
I'll do it!

02:44.631 --> 02:46.298
(screams)
Hey, how about Hayley?

02:47.817 --> 02:49.718
Hey, Hayley, be our line judge!

02:49.753 --> 02:52.021
Can't! I'm making a landing pad

02:52.055 --> 02:53.956
for when the aliens
bring Jeff back.

02:53.990 --> 02:55.291
Okay, sweetie.

02:55.325 --> 02:58.294
I'm sure by now he's been
dissected for science.

02:58.328 --> 02:59.962
Or for fun.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.163
(to himself):
It's pretty fun.

03:01.198 --> 03:02.932
So tell her she's
wasting her time.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.233
Wouldn't matter if I did.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.602
She's clearly in the first
of the five stages of grief.

03:06.636 --> 03:08.671
Denial.
How do you know that stuff?

03:08.705 --> 03:10.839
Back in the late '60s,
I was porkin' this

03:10.874 --> 03:14.243
unattractive lady scientist,
Elizabeth Kubler Ross.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.128
I dumped her hard for no reason.

03:16.162 --> 03:17.796
Out of nowhere. It was awesome.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.565
Six months later,
she wrote a book

03:19.599 --> 03:21.600
about the grief it caused her.
(wry chuckle)

03:21.635 --> 03:24.870
Anyway, in order for Hayley
to get over Jeff,

03:24.905 --> 03:27.506
she first has to go
through denial, then anger,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.275
then bargaining,
followed by depression,

03:29.309 --> 03:31.176
and finally acceptance.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.978
And then she can
be our line judge?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.446
Yeah. But it could
take years.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.464
Well, we don't have years.

03:35.498 --> 03:36.832
We'll just have to ram her

03:36.866 --> 03:38.384
through the stages
as fast as we can.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.286
Well, Hayley is pretty
easy to manipulate.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.221
I once convinced her
to go to the hospital

03:42.255 --> 03:44.356
by putting a piece
of glass in her neck.

03:44.374 --> 03:47.025
We need to find out
what you excel at!

03:47.043 --> 03:51.030
(wobbly): You're ruining
your own sweater!

03:58.872 --> 04:01.056
I'm Robby!

04:02.926 --> 04:05.928
(playing off-key)

04:07.000 --> 04:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.959 --> 04:21.260
We found it.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.595
We found it!

04:22.629 --> 04:24.079
All right!

04:24.114 --> 04:26.081
But... you're...

04:26.116 --> 04:27.933
Well, what do think?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.102
Will my super realistic
Steve Smith masks

04:30.136 --> 04:31.971
get me into a good school?

04:32.005 --> 04:35.941
Hey, Mom, you want
to help me shower?

04:38.478 --> 04:40.679
You are good at nothing.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.015
But there's still
minority quotas.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.684
Your name is Tatonka.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.603
Now I'm gonna jump online

04:47.637 --> 04:49.822
and buy you a book
on dealing blackjack.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.192
Aah, I can't remember
our Amazon password.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.461
The hint says,
"Loose stool."

04:55.495 --> 04:57.563
Oh, right, diarrhea!

04:57.597 --> 04:59.031
"D"...
um...

04:59.065 --> 05:01.200
Does anyone know how
to spell "diarrhea"?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.768
Why would you pick that word?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.103
It's impossible to spell.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.271
D-I-A-R-R-H-E-A.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.308
Oh, my God, you're right!

05:09.342 --> 05:11.343
Hey, spell...

05:12.779 --> 05:14.213
"Carcinogenic."

05:14.247 --> 05:17.082
C-A-R-C-I-N-O-G-E-N-I-C.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.851
Steve, you're a great speller!

05:18.885 --> 05:20.853
You can win the National
Spelling Bee!

05:20.887 --> 05:22.988
That'll get you
into a top college.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.791
We should probably get
this stuff off your face!

05:28.328 --> 05:30.229
We're down to our
last two students,

05:30.263 --> 05:33.165
Steve Smith and Marty Nipples.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.234
That is some name.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.902
Okay, Marty, you're up.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.438
Spell the word, "Buh-log-na."

05:39.472 --> 05:40.606
Do you mean, "bologna"?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.274
Quit stallin', Nipples.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.642
Uh...

05:43.677 --> 05:45.077
Time's up! Steve?

05:45.111 --> 05:46.345
B-O-L-O-G-N-A.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.346
Winner!

05:47.380 --> 05:49.348
Congratulations, Steve.

05:49.382 --> 05:52.751
You have a skill that computers
have made obsolete.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.188
You did it!

05:56.222 --> 05:58.791
Next stop:
All City Finals!

05:58.825 --> 06:00.926
You were awesome
up there, Steve.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.461
I love watching you spell.

06:02.495 --> 06:06.131
Speaking of spells, I think
you just cast one on me.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.001
(weird, cocky laugh)

06:10.019 --> 06:11.336
(giggles)

06:11.371 --> 06:14.339
My son's gonna win the
National Spelling Bee.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.409
Ha! That's impossible,
because Akiko is going to win.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.913
She's already won at her
private school in Maryland.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.682
And if Steve does
make it to Nationals,

06:23.717 --> 06:26.034
Akiko will be there
to crush him.

06:26.069 --> 06:30.589
No, Steve is gonna be the
one who destroys Akiko.

06:30.623 --> 06:34.860
Your skin is amazing; I
can't tell how old you are.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.667
Two households,
both alike in dignity.

06:41.701 --> 06:45.904
In fair Langley,
where we lay our scene.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.574
Shakespeare, bitches!

06:50.875 --> 06:52.943
(video game beeping)

06:58.148 --> 06:59.054
(shrieks)

06:59.170 --> 07:00.433
No more games!

07:00.553 --> 07:03.039
I talked a lot of
smack to Akiko's mom.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.523
You have to win that
National Spelling Bee

07:05.643 --> 07:07.410
so that you can go
to a top college,

07:07.445 --> 07:10.947
and I can rub it in that
Kabuki whore's porcelain face.

07:10.981 --> 07:14.217
From now on, your
whole life is words.

07:16.904 --> 07:17.871
Hey!

07:17.905 --> 07:19.572
That's how you spell that?

07:19.607 --> 07:22.776
Hayley, I need you to understand
Jeff's not coming back.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.210
(whispers):
Never.

07:24.228 --> 07:26.513
He's trapped in a cage
thousands of light-years away.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.714
(whispers):
So far.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.881
It's hopeless.

07:28.899 --> 07:30.433
We'll never know
what happened to him.

07:30.468 --> 07:31.601
(whispers):
Space rape.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.069
He'll come back.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.505
Okay, we're not gonna be able
to pull her out of denial,

07:35.539 --> 07:37.524
so we're gonna have to
push her right into anger.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.326
Ya!
Ah!

07:40.361 --> 07:41.778
What are you doing?!

07:41.812 --> 07:43.096
Front wedgie!

07:43.130 --> 07:44.080

07:44.115 --> 07:45.582

I will kill you!

07:47.251 --> 07:49.469

07:51.939 --> 07:53.273
We did it!

Oh, you scared me!

08:34.698 --> 08:36.332
But in a manly way.

08:36.366 --> 08:38.967
You came here to get away
from everything, too, huh?

08:39.003 --> 08:40.068
Yeah.

08:40.104 --> 08:42.337
Spelling can't find us here.

08:42.373 --> 08:43.873
That's so poetic.

08:43.908 --> 08:45.041
Is it?

08:45.075 --> 08:46.209
Yeah.

08:46.243 --> 08:48.228
Ugh, my mom's driving me crazy.

08:48.262 --> 08:49.295
Mine, too.

08:49.330 --> 08:50.680
But it's nice to have

10:21.338 --> 10:23.289

Steve, if Akiko beats you
tomorrow,

10:29.230 --> 10:31.231
you'll never get
into a good college.

10:31.265 --> 10:34.367
I forbid you to see
that girl again!

10:34.401 --> 10:36.502
If you won't let me
be with Akiko,

10:36.537 --> 10:38.504
then I won't even go
to the stupid spelling bee!

10:38.539 --> 10:39.672
(crying)

10:39.707 --> 10:42.041
What am I doing?

10:42.076 --> 10:45.411
I've completely lost sight
of what's important,

10:45.446 --> 10:46.879
and that's your happiness.

10:46.914 --> 10:50.283
Steve, of course you
can go see Akiko.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.484
Rea-Really?

10:51.518 --> 10:55.488
Sure. Go have a great time
at the Falls, honey.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.324
I-I'm just gonna sit
here for a minute.

10:58.359 --> 11:00.860
Think of grandma in the shower.

11:02.196 --> 11:03.796
Thanks, Mom!

11:04.965 --> 11:07.367
Okay, now we have to
get Hayley from anger

11:07.401 --> 11:08.501
into the next stage:
bargaining.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.019
What's that?

11:10.054 --> 11:11.888
I don't know-- that's why we're
gonna skip that one

11:11.922 --> 11:14.023
and go right on to depression.
Hayley!

11:14.058 --> 11:15.742
What?!

11:15.776 --> 11:17.977
We have a little presentation
for you.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.980
(ukulele intro to "Somewhere
Over the Rainbow" plays)

11:21.015 --> 11:23.750
ROGER:
♪ Oooh...

11:23.784 --> 11:26.869
♪ Somewhere

11:26.904 --> 11:29.272
♪ Over the rainbow

11:29.306 --> 11:35.511
♪ Way up high

11:35.546 --> 11:39.082
♪ There's a land

11:39.116 --> 11:41.084
♪ That I heard of

11:41.118 --> 11:46.105
♪ Once in a lullaby.

11:47.691 --> 11:52.061
(sobbing)

11:54.298 --> 11:56.282
Depression!

12:00.287 --> 12:01.421
Akiko?

12:06.543 --> 12:08.011
Nooooo!

12:11.162 --> 12:12.632
What's the matter, honey?

12:12.666 --> 12:14.117
Akiko blew me off.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.651
She said she had to...

12:15.686 --> 12:17.587
"rethink" her priorities.

12:17.621 --> 12:19.989
And that I'm not
"worth her time."

12:20.024 --> 12:23.609
Oh, Steve,
that's so crappy of her.

12:23.644 --> 12:25.595
Oh, what am I gonna do?

12:25.629 --> 12:27.330
Well, you have two options:

12:27.364 --> 12:30.500
You can fall apart like
a bitch-punk in the street,

12:30.534 --> 12:32.135
or you can Mark Zuckerberg
this thing.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.302
You think?

12:33.337 --> 12:34.470
Yeah.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.305
Any man who ever
did anything great

12:36.340 --> 12:38.875
was just trying to
show up some piece of ass

12:38.909 --> 12:40.109
who didn't give him any.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.197
Excuse me, Mother.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.133
I've got some spelling to do!

12:51.472 --> 12:53.139
Let me out of here!

12:53.173 --> 12:55.742
Not until after
the spelling bee tomorrow.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.879
My boy's going to a good college
and nobody's getting in his way.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.214
I'm not in his way!

13:01.248 --> 13:02.915
I love being with Steve!

13:02.950 --> 13:05.918
Not according to
this note <i>you</i> wrote.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.854
(laughs maniacally)

13:19.691 --> 13:20.691
All right, honey.

13:20.725 --> 13:21.925
Today's the day.

13:22.014 --> 13:25.049
You win this and you'll get
into any college you want.

13:25.083 --> 13:28.469
And I'm gonna destroy
the girl who destroyed me.

13:28.504 --> 13:31.139
R-E-V-E-N-G-E!

13:32.808 --> 13:35.243
Revenge, Mother.
I spelled revenge.

13:35.277 --> 13:37.845
If you say so.
I didn't hear a "J."

13:37.880 --> 13:40.114
Now go sit in the car;
I'll be right out.

13:43.836 --> 13:45.636
Let me out of here!

13:45.671 --> 13:48.239
I'll let you out when Steve's
a national champion.

13:48.273 --> 13:50.475
Here's a Nintendo
to keep you busy.

13:51.777 --> 13:54.212
My mother says
video games are bad for you.

13:54.246 --> 13:56.747
Yeah, well, so is smoking
an eight ball of crack

13:56.782 --> 13:59.717
in 30 minutes, but that's
how long it takes.

14:02.254 --> 14:04.405
I've got half the Yakuza
looking for your sister.

14:04.439 --> 14:06.908
In the meantime, take the
bloodhounds and search the city.

14:09.261 --> 14:10.427
What?

14:10.445 --> 14:12.113
Why do you only speak Japanese?

14:12.147 --> 14:13.681
I don't even speak Japanese.

14:13.715 --> 14:16.450
Just go-- go find your sister.

14:16.485 --> 14:17.518
(phone rings)

14:17.553 --> 14:18.586
Talk to me.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.055
This is your cousin,
Nobu Malibu.

14:21.089 --> 14:22.823
I have a lock
on Akiko's location.

14:22.858 --> 14:25.493
She registered her name
on a Nintendo Wii system.

14:25.527 --> 14:28.162
Give me the address.

14:30.699 --> 14:32.200
(crying)

14:36.221 --> 14:37.755
(excited):
Ninja!

14:37.789 --> 14:38.856
(gasps, scared):
Ninja!

14:43.896 --> 14:45.463
(video game music playing)

14:46.481 --> 14:47.932
(music stops)

14:47.966 --> 14:49.267
Mother?

14:49.301 --> 14:52.169
Scoot back, we have 20 minutes
to get you to Nationals.

14:54.406 --> 14:57.241
(scatting a jazz melody)

14:57.276 --> 14:58.709
(holding a high note)

15:04.550 --> 15:07.885
ANNOUNCER: ...and representing
Kentucky, Brigid Hendricks.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.453
(audience applauding)

15:09.488 --> 15:12.673
From Virginia,
Steven Anita Smith.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.475
(applause)

15:14.509 --> 15:17.645
And from Maryland,
Akiko Yoshida.

15:17.679 --> 15:22.149
(people murmuring in confusion)

15:22.184 --> 15:23.784
Akiko Yoshida.

15:23.819 --> 15:26.254
Miss Yoshida, going once...

15:26.288 --> 15:27.855
going twice...

15:27.889 --> 15:29.290
and...

15:29.324 --> 15:31.876
Hyoooo...

15:31.910 --> 15:34.879
Hyo sheeee...

15:34.913 --> 15:37.181
Look who decided to show up.

15:37.215 --> 15:38.916
It's not what you
think-- your mother--

15:38.951 --> 15:39.917
Your mother!

15:39.952 --> 15:41.352
Steve, let me explain--

15:41.386 --> 15:42.386
Your mother!

15:42.421 --> 15:43.938
I don't want to hear
your lame excuses!

15:43.972 --> 15:45.606
I don't want to look
at your stupid face!

15:45.641 --> 15:47.058
(gasps) Fine.

15:47.092 --> 15:48.659
Forget it, jerk.

15:48.694 --> 15:50.194
I'm taking you down.

15:50.228 --> 15:52.396
I'm already down.

15:52.431 --> 15:55.199
You don't give me comfortability
problems anymore.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.701
ANNOUNCER:
Quiet, please.

15:56.735 --> 15:59.870
Billy Hemphall, your word is...

16:05.978 --> 16:08.779
(laughing)

16:08.814 --> 16:11.115
This is a fight to the death.

16:11.149 --> 16:13.184
There's no way you can beat me.

16:13.218 --> 16:14.285
I'm Asian.

16:14.319 --> 16:16.387
This is my culture.

16:16.421 --> 16:20.725
Oh, Francine, are we late for
our grandson's spelling bee?

16:20.759 --> 16:23.194
No, Mah Mah,
it's right through there.

16:24.329 --> 16:25.796
Wait, you're Chinese?

16:25.831 --> 16:28.899
Hyooooooo!

16:32.387 --> 16:33.204
(both grunt)

16:36.508 --> 16:38.209
I got ninja-darted
in the neck,

16:38.243 --> 16:40.144
and while I was in the void

16:40.178 --> 16:41.646
between this world
and the next,

16:41.680 --> 16:45.516
an overwhelming realization
washed over me that Jeff...

16:45.550 --> 16:46.817
is gone.

16:46.852 --> 16:48.386
And I accept that now.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.920
Great!

16:49.955 --> 16:53.240
I also accept that you two jerks

16:53.275 --> 16:55.476
are the reason he was abducted
in the first place.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.545
And now, I'm taking
your shuttlecock.

16:58.447 --> 16:59.547
She'll be back.

16:59.581 --> 17:01.248
Roger...
I think you're in denial.

17:01.283 --> 17:02.616
No, I'm not.

17:02.651 --> 17:04.752
I hate you!
I've always hated you!

17:04.786 --> 17:06.186
If she brings back
the shuttlecock,

17:06.221 --> 17:07.887
I'll feed the needy, I swear.

17:07.923 --> 17:10.141
Oh, God, I don't think
I can face this.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.143
I don't want to be
around people.

17:12.176 --> 17:13.377
You know what?

17:13.412 --> 17:14.979
It is what it is.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.615
Roger, you just went through
the five stages of grief!

17:17.648 --> 17:19.583
But my species has six stages.

17:21.236 --> 17:22.869
(groaning):
Was that the sixth stage?

17:22.904 --> 17:24.771
Nope.

17:49.328 --> 17:52.149
Francine! Quit playing around
with your friend.

17:52.184 --> 17:55.286
It's down to two kids,
and one of them is Steve.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.987
Is the other one
a Japanese girl?

17:57.022 --> 17:59.223
(deeply):
Oh, yeah.

17:59.257 --> 18:00.124
Bah Bah!

18:00.158 --> 18:01.892
I answered the question.

18:04.029 --> 18:06.564
ANNOUNCER:
Your word is... "chrysanthemum."

18:06.598 --> 18:08.432
Chrysanthemum.

18:08.467 --> 18:13.871
C-H-R-Y-S-A-N-T-H-I-M-U-M.

18:13.905 --> 18:15.039
Chrysanthemum.

18:15.073 --> 18:16.140
That is...

18:16.174 --> 18:17.241
incorrect.

18:20.112 --> 18:24.348
ANNOUNCER: Steve, if you get
this next word right, you win.

18:24.382 --> 18:26.817
You've disgraced yourself
and your family!

18:26.852 --> 18:28.586
You didn't work hard enough!

18:28.620 --> 18:30.321
When I think back
to all the times

18:30.355 --> 18:31.989
I was too lenient with you.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.724
The time I let you
pet that dog!

18:33.759 --> 18:35.526
Well, those luxuries are over!

18:35.560 --> 18:39.363
ANNOUNCER:
Steve, your word is "diarrhea."

18:39.397 --> 18:41.248
Steve has diarrhea.

18:41.299 --> 18:42.867
Steve has diarrhea!

18:42.901 --> 18:44.135
Diarrhea.

18:44.169 --> 18:47.972
D-I-A-R...

18:48.006 --> 18:52.443
Y-O-F-A-M-A-D-B-L-A-C-K-
W-O-M-A-N.

18:52.477 --> 18:53.477
Incorrect.

18:53.512 --> 18:55.880
The word was "diarrhea."

18:55.914 --> 18:59.650
You spelled
"Diary of a Mad Black Woman."

18:59.684 --> 19:02.219
Akiko, you are still
in the competition.

19:02.254 --> 19:03.370
What are you doing?!

19:03.405 --> 19:05.039
I know you know that word!

19:05.073 --> 19:07.374
Akiko needs this
more than I do.

19:07.409 --> 19:09.343
Her mom will hate
her if she loses.

19:09.377 --> 19:12.379
But you, you love me
no matter what.

19:12.414 --> 19:14.381
Sure I was hurt by Akiko's note,

19:14.416 --> 19:17.351
but her crazy, overbearing
mother drove her to it.

19:18.854 --> 19:21.889
You are...
such a good kid, Steve.

19:21.923 --> 19:23.257
And you know what?

19:23.291 --> 19:26.727
I would rather have a son
who's a great person

19:26.761 --> 19:30.297
than a son who goes
to a great school.

19:31.566 --> 19:33.901
I wrote the note
and kidnapped Akiko.

19:33.935 --> 19:35.169
You what?!

19:35.203 --> 19:36.537
I put her in a cage.

19:36.571 --> 19:37.938
Mom, how could you?!

19:37.973 --> 19:39.740
I was so mean to her.

19:39.774 --> 19:44.378
I treated her like all Persian
men treat all Persian women!

19:44.412 --> 19:47.781
ANNOUNCER:
Your word is... "sacrifice."

19:51.186 --> 19:52.419
Sacrifice.

19:52.454 --> 19:56.323
S-A-C-R-I...

19:56.358 --> 19:59.226
K-I-S-S.

19:59.261 --> 20:01.629
Okay, you spelled, "sacrikiss"

20:01.663 --> 20:04.031
while gazing into
that boy's eyes.

20:04.065 --> 20:05.132
What are you doing?

20:05.166 --> 20:06.800
I heard what you said
to your mom.

20:06.835 --> 20:08.469
You deserve to win.

20:08.503 --> 20:10.271
Steve, spell...

20:10.305 --> 20:11.272
"medicine."

20:11.306 --> 20:12.573
Medicine.

20:12.607 --> 20:15.109
M-E-D...

20:15.143 --> 20:20.247
E-A-S-F-A-M-I-L-Y-
R-E-U-N-I-O-N.

20:20.282 --> 20:23.117
Okay, that is
obviously incorrect

20:23.151 --> 20:26.654
because you spelled
"Medea's Family Reunion."

20:29.891 --> 20:32.192
ANNOUNCER:
Okay Steve, the word was "dog,"

20:32.227 --> 20:34.128
and you spelled the entire

20:34.162 --> 20:36.764
<i>Arrested Development</i> song,
"Mr. Wendell."

20:36.798 --> 20:39.867
So... on to Akiko.

20:39.901 --> 20:43.470
Akiko, your word is "A."

20:43.505 --> 20:44.471
Seven.

20:44.506 --> 20:46.173
Okay, that was a number.

20:46.207 --> 20:47.708
It's becoming very clear to me

20:47.742 --> 20:49.410
that I won't be making
my date tonight.

20:49.444 --> 20:53.213
We recently started having sex,
so that would've been fun.

20:53.248 --> 20:56.027
We've got two really
great kids here.

20:56.147 --> 20:57.614
We sure do.
