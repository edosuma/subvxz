WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:08.210
The bystander that witnessed the
abduction described a suspect

00:08.260 --> 00:10.960
of average height and build
wearing a dark balaclava.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.730
HELP!

00:16.820 --> 00:18.250
He tore out my earrings.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.410
These appear to have been
the most significant finds

00:20.460 --> 00:21.570
at the crime scene.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.770
There's a very subtle point
you've probably missed.

00:23.820 --> 00:25.340
Trust me, I haven't.

00:28.380 --> 00:30.010
There's a lot of evidence to go through.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.660
But we need a breakthrough.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.850
Michael Farmer, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of abduction

00:34.900 --> 00:36.260
and attempted murder.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.770
The 24-year-old man has been charged

00:40.820 --> 00:42.730
in connection with the murder

00:42.780 --> 00:44.140
of Baswinder Kaur...

00:45.340 --> 00:47.890
.. the disappearance
of Leonie Collersdale,

00:47.940 --> 00:51.290
and the abduction and attempted
murder of a third woman.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.690
Evidence may have been planted.

00:52.740 --> 00:54.170
Evidence may have been suppressed.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.130
The man they've charged
could well be innocent.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.530
There's facts...

00:57.580 --> 00:59.180
and then there's the truth.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.930
A detective under that
kind of undue pressure

01:03.980 --> 01:05.690
can sometimes bend the facts,

01:05.740 --> 01:09.330
to suit the expectations
of his, or her, superiors.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.450
We trust our officers
to conduct themselves

01:11.500 --> 01:13.610
with professionalism and integrity.

01:13.660 --> 01:15.130
As of now,

01:15.180 --> 01:17.490
we are investigating
Roz Huntley's charging

01:17.540 --> 01:18.850
of Michael Farmer.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.060
Sir.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.460
AC-12.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.970
See you again, DCI Huntley.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.610
DS Kate Flynn.

01:28.660 --> 01:32.060
I've been placed on temporary
secondment to your team, ma'am.

01:36.260 --> 01:40.060
- I get muddled sometimes.
- Do you want to stop the interview, Michael?

01:40.180 --> 01:41.370
I'd like you to desist, please,

01:41.420 --> 01:43.250
while I take this up
with your senior officer.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.490
As you wish, ma'am.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.130
Huntley's definitely hiding something

01:46.180 --> 01:49.880
about how the case against Farmer
was handled. What, I don't know.

01:50.300 --> 01:54.210
This is the man I'm convinced killed
Baswinder Kaur, Leonie Collersdale,

01:54.260 --> 01:55.650
and abducted Hana Reznikova,

01:55.700 --> 01:57.650
and framed Michael Farmer for everything.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.900
And Roz Huntley has stopped
everyone looking for him.

02:05.020 --> 02:06.650
What have you got against Michael Farmer?

02:06.700 --> 02:09.600
Except him being retarded
enough for you to frame!

02:16.900 --> 02:18.170
I'm at Blackthorn.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.370
The DS from East Mids,
she's with Farmer again.

02:20.420 --> 02:21.410
'God's sake.'

02:21.460 --> 02:23.250
Yeah, I'm trying to get
hold of DCI Huntley.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.410
'Right.'

02:24.460 --> 02:27.360
- She didn't come into work
this morning. - ID, please.

02:28.540 --> 02:29.860
'OK. I'll get back to you.'

02:34.820 --> 02:38.420
Michael, I need to ask you some
questions about Rikki Neville.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.410
I've learned that she had a
boyfriend that lived in Moss Heath.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.850
That's where she went the
night she disappeared.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.400
Moss Heath, isn't that
where you live, Michael?

02:48.220 --> 02:50.930
Michael, you don't have to
stay and speak to DS Flynn.

02:50.980 --> 02:52.490
You can leave at any time.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.090
Or if you do speak to her,

02:54.140 --> 02:55.610
you're still under caution.

02:55.660 --> 02:58.090
Anything you say can be used in evidence,

02:58.140 --> 02:59.260
don't forget that.

03:00.540 --> 03:01.780
I want to help.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.130
Yes. DS Twyler.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.570
Have you got DCI Huntley there
with you, by any chance?

03:07.620 --> 03:11.140
'Uh, no, not seen her, she's not
here. She's probably at home.'

03:12.100 --> 03:14.210
I've already tried her
home number. Nothing.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.530
['Sorry.']

03:15.580 --> 03:17.080
All right. Cheers, anyway.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.780
Ta.

03:22.860 --> 03:26.170
For the tape, I'm showing the
interviewee a CCTV image.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.330
This image was also taken in Moss Heath,

03:28.380 --> 03:29.810
the night another girl went missing,

03:29.860 --> 03:31.130
Leonie Collersdale.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.050
Maybe this man knows something about
what happened to Rikki Neville?

03:35.100 --> 03:38.600
What I'm wondering, Michael, is
if you might know who this man is?

03:45.540 --> 03:47.180
OK, we'll leave it there.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.580
I've remembered the name of the hospital.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.130
What's that, Michael?

03:55.180 --> 03:58.880
I said I want to help, and I've
remembered the name of the hospital.

04:02.340 --> 04:05.130
'You told your employer
it was a hospital...

04:05.180 --> 04:06.580
'St Anthony's.'

04:07.940 --> 04:09.290
'St Anthony's.'

04:09.340 --> 04:10.810
'But we checked St Anthony's,

04:10.860 --> 04:14.060
'and they've got no record that
you were there that night.'

04:14.300 --> 04:16.730
'We want to get to the truth, Michael,

04:16.779 --> 04:19.490
'but it's very difficult if you
can't provide us with the right...'

04:19.540 --> 04:20.970
As you were.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.890
Sir, I got a tip-off from
Kate about a possible alibi.

04:23.940 --> 04:27.130
Under the pressure of interview,
Farmer gave the wrong hospital.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.650
Michael Farmer was actually
admitted to City General Hospital

04:29.700 --> 04:31.570
on the night Leonie
Collersdale disappeared.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.020
He wasn't discharged till two days later.

04:34.420 --> 04:37.650
Well, let's see what DCI
Huntley has to say about that.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.860
- Start drafting a Reg 15.
- Sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.820 --> 04:54.010
- DS Twyler.
- DS Flynn.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.380
- Hi, Rupal.
- Hiya.

04:57.620 --> 04:59.500
A body's been found. A woman.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.050
Where's Tim Ifield?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.570
He's not on shift.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.020
Stuck with me, I'm afraid.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.370
Any idea who she is?

05:13.420 --> 05:15.130
From what there is, we've done pretty well

05:15.180 --> 05:16.770
to identify her as female.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.220
She's been dismembered.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.890
- Is Roz on her way?
- Haven't got hold of her yet.

05:25.940 --> 05:29.340
OK, well, the first body parts
were found there and there...

05:35.100 --> 05:37.690
DCI Huntley's not answering
any of her numbers.

05:37.740 --> 05:40.860
Her Federation rep's had
a go, too. Sorry, Sarge.

06:12.340 --> 06:13.970
Has anyone checked with Resources

06:14.020 --> 06:16.890
if Roz has been given last-minute
leave or time off in lieu?

06:16.940 --> 06:18.530
It'll be summat with her kids.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.250
No-one dobs in the boss.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.800
What are you talking about?

06:24.460 --> 06:25.850
Yeah.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.060
Thanks, Rupal. I'll talk to you later.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.450
Right.

06:30.500 --> 06:34.530
Sum total of the find is the
torso, divided into two sections

06:34.580 --> 06:35.970
plus one arm.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.610
I've asked Rupal to fast-track DNA,

06:37.660 --> 06:39.690
see if we can match the
body to Leonie Collersdale

06:39.740 --> 06:42.180
or to Kate's missing girl, Rikki Neville.

06:43.260 --> 06:46.170
- Jodie, you OK to liaise with
Rupal? - Yes, ma'am. - Right.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.770
And Neil, best to let the
Collersdales' FLO know

06:48.820 --> 06:50.090
that we've found a body,

06:50.140 --> 06:53.330
but absolutely not to say anything
to the family till we know more.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.410
Boss.

06:54.460 --> 06:55.770
Everything all right, ma'am?

06:55.820 --> 06:57.650
Sorry, I really wasn't
up to coming in earlier.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.050
I think I've picked up some kind of bug.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.300
Grim night.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.090
Sorry to bring you in.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.540
- This can't wait.
- Sir.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.450
I got an e-mail earlier.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.940
AC-12 are going to serve you
with a Regulation 15 Notice.

07:28.020 --> 07:31.120
Ted Hastings, usual story.
He's got a bee in his bonnet.

07:31.940 --> 07:34.770
As good as told me you've been
under disproportionate pressure

07:34.820 --> 07:36.810
to secure charges against Farmer.

07:36.860 --> 07:38.260
Executive pressure.

07:40.780 --> 07:44.580
I'm the one who's been shielding
you from all the flak over Trapdoor.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.770
We're in this together,

07:46.820 --> 07:49.140
shoulder to shoulder. Huh?

07:55.260 --> 07:58.160
It's bad enough the kids
being on another planet...

07:58.500 --> 07:59.810
Sorry?

07:59.860 --> 08:02.420
We eat later so we can sit down together.

08:04.580 --> 08:05.620
Lost my appetite.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.340
Anything to do with last night?

08:10.140 --> 08:13.450
You'd just gone when I realised
you'd left your phone at home.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.290
Yeah, I checked my messages this morning.

08:15.340 --> 08:17.420
The kids called. Why weren't you in?

08:19.100 --> 08:21.050
I was having a drink with Jimmy.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.770
So it's OK for you to have a
drink with your mate, but...

08:23.820 --> 08:26.420
- it's a problem if I'm at work?
- The kids were fine.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.530
Couldn't you have
borrowed someone's phone,

08:28.580 --> 08:31.480
- to let us know where you were?
- We were chasing a lead.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.280
The body that was still missing.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.140
Leonie Collersdale.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.340
You found her?

08:40.380 --> 08:41.460
Some of her.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.500
I should have borrowed
someone else's phone.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.940
It got late and...

08:52.260 --> 08:54.610
.. I just didn't want to
wake up the whole house.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.330
- Sorry.
- Hey, now, hey, don't be daft.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.480
I'm just worried about you, that's all.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.370
- Have you cut yourself?
- It's fine.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.420
I just caught it on some brickwork.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.410
I'll be fine.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.860
I'll warm that up for you.

09:32.980 --> 09:36.330
AC-12 interview of Detective
Chief Inspector Roseanne Huntley,

09:36.380 --> 09:39.090
in the presence of her Police
Federation Representative...

09:39.140 --> 09:40.570
DCI Mark Moffatt.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.090
Interview by Superintendent
Hastings, Detective Sergeant Arnott.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.170
For the DIR, the screen
shows Michael Farmer,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.490
currently remanded in custody
charged with the murder

09:49.540 --> 09:51.890
of Baswinder Kaur, the
murder of Leonie Collersdale,

09:51.940 --> 09:54.690
and the kidnapping and attempted
murder of Hana Reznikova.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.770
In respect of evidence against Mr Farmer,

09:56.820 --> 10:00.290
our first consideration
is item reference AP-5,

10:00.340 --> 10:02.050
Hana Reznikova's clothing,

10:02.100 --> 10:03.700
Document 5 in your folders.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.530
Hana's clothing yielded
item reference HLA-8,

10:09.580 --> 10:11.580
that's Document 6 in your folders.

10:13.300 --> 10:18.090
HLA-8 also matched fibres found
on Michael Farmer's clothing.

10:18.140 --> 10:20.690
It appears Farmer managed
to dispose of the jacket,

10:20.740 --> 10:22.930
but fibres were still left
on the clothes he was wearing

10:22.980 --> 10:25.010
- at the time of his arrest.
- Fibres?

10:25.060 --> 10:27.370
DCI Huntley has the right to
be questioned by an officer

10:27.420 --> 10:29.010
at least one rank senior.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.490
Yes, but you take DS Arnott's
point, don't you, DCI Huntley?

10:31.540 --> 10:34.330
Only ONE fibre was found.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.650
I mean, that's pretty
meagre, wouldn't you say?

10:36.700 --> 10:40.010
Given that our man's meant to have
bundled that wee girl into his car,

10:40.060 --> 10:41.530
transferred her across town,

10:41.580 --> 10:43.130
and then locked her up in his house?

10:43.180 --> 10:45.130
Nonetheless, it's still evidence

10:45.180 --> 10:47.330
proving Farmer was in
physical contact with Hana

10:47.380 --> 10:48.570
on the night of the abduction.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.650
Actually it's evidence he
might have been in contact

10:50.700 --> 10:53.170
with a black item of clothing,
and as the jacket was never found,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.650
we have no definitive match to
the one used in the abduction,

10:55.700 --> 10:56.690
added to which,

10:56.740 --> 10:59.130
a single fibre is more consistent
with cross-contamination.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.730
That's correct, isn't it, DCI Huntley?

11:00.780 --> 11:02.450
It's more likely that a stray fibre

11:02.500 --> 11:05.090
contaminated Michael Farmer's
clothing during his arrest,

11:05.140 --> 11:06.570
transfer, or custody?

11:06.620 --> 11:09.490
Sir, I took scrupulous measures
to prevent cross-contamination

11:09.540 --> 11:10.690
of forensic evidence.

11:10.740 --> 11:14.610
That's why I'm certain this fibre
is proof of physical contact

11:14.660 --> 11:15.890
between Farmer and Hana.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.570
Well, Hana described her
attacker as wearing a balaclava.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.930
No fibres consistent with
a balaclava were detected

11:20.980 --> 11:22.490
in Michael Farmer's hair.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.170
That doesn't mean he wasn't wearing one,

11:24.220 --> 11:26.090
just that we didn't find any fibres.

11:26.140 --> 11:28.770
Absence of evidence isn't the
same as evidence of absence.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.970
Yes.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.770
There you go.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.450
It couldn't be more clear
in respect of the foregoing.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.100
You just admitted to
an absence of evidence.

11:39.660 --> 11:40.930
Document 9.

11:40.980 --> 11:44.250
Document 9 is a signal strength
triangulation map carried out

11:44.300 --> 11:49.370
on Michael Farmer's phone in respect
of 9th of March from 20.30 to 22.00.

11:49.420 --> 11:50.730
Said triangulation shows

11:50.780 --> 11:52.970
the phone remained within
the mobile phone cell

11:53.020 --> 11:55.250
covering Michael Farmer's
grandmother's nursing home

11:55.300 --> 11:57.690
until he went to start his shift at 22.00.

11:57.740 --> 12:00.970
The map also shows the location
of Hana Reznikova's abduction.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.810
Seems like your man wasn't in the
right place at the right time.

12:03.860 --> 12:05.290
Just because the phone was there

12:05.340 --> 12:06.650
doesn't mean Farmer was.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.850
And there are no witnesses
to Farmer loitering

12:08.900 --> 12:12.170
near his grandmother's nursing
home for an hour and 45 minutes.

12:12.220 --> 12:14.250
He left it there the whole time?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.410
We really don't know what
he did with his phone, sir.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.370
No calls were made in those hours.

12:18.420 --> 12:22.220
And yet the phone was back on his
person by the time he was arrested?

12:22.860 --> 12:24.130
Yes, sir.

12:24.180 --> 12:26.570
Hana Reznikova was
abducted using a vehicle

12:26.620 --> 12:28.730
found in the vicinity of
Michael Farmer's home.

12:28.780 --> 12:29.970
Yes.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.720
Michael Farmer doesn't
hold a driving licence.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.490
He's never held a driving licence.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.010
He's never owned a car,

12:36.060 --> 12:37.490
neither has his grandmother.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.890
I'm familiar with those findings,

12:38.940 --> 12:41.330
and naturally, I gave them consideration.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.610
Farmer's had ample opportunity
to learn to drive informally.

12:44.660 --> 12:45.770
In his neighbourhood,

12:45.820 --> 12:47.930
it's not uncommon for
motorists to drive illegally,

12:47.980 --> 12:49.570
without a licence or insurance.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.170
Come on, that's an assumption,

12:51.220 --> 12:53.250
and a pretty big one, if you ask me.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.210
I mean, have you witnesses to
Michael Farmer being able to drive?

12:56.260 --> 12:57.860
Inquiries are ongoing, sir.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.820
"Ongoing."

13:01.140 --> 13:04.650
Document 11 in your folders.
Item reference TJI-1.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.090
Item TJI-1 is a pair of
bloodstained earrings.

13:08.140 --> 13:10.250
They were found in Michael Farmer's home.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.810
The bloodstains were swabbed.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.890
The blood matched a control
sample taken from Hana Reznikova.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.090
They were Hana's earrings.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.290
Farmer ripped them out,

13:17.340 --> 13:19.170
before leaving Hana to die in the fire.

13:19.220 --> 13:20.290
And she would have,

13:20.340 --> 13:23.640
if I hadn't have gone into the
burning house and saved her.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.250
DS Arnott.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.970
Item reference TJI-2 is a hairgrip.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.250
At Michael Farmer's home,

13:31.300 --> 13:35.650
we also found said hair grip
bearing DNA matching Baswinder Kaur,

13:35.700 --> 13:39.610
and a necklace bearing DNA
matching Leonie Collersdale.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.770
Tests indicated carpet fibre
deposits present on other items

13:42.820 --> 13:45.650
recovered from Michael Farmer's
home address were absent on the items

13:45.700 --> 13:48.170
specifically linking Farmer
to the previous victims.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.810
Those items were trophies.

13:49.860 --> 13:52.690
I took the view that Michael
Farmer took special care of them,

13:52.740 --> 13:55.010
keeping them in a safe
place, keeping them clean,

13:55.060 --> 13:58.170
and for that reason I discounted
the carpet fibre profile.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.970
There was also a boot print
relating to a person unknown.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.770
There was nothing that connected the
boot print to the personal items.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.050
Like the carpet fibres,

14:05.100 --> 14:07.650
on the balance of
evidence I discounted it,

14:07.700 --> 14:10.450
in favour of the compelling
evidence against Michael Farmer.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.370
On screen, image 47.

14:13.420 --> 14:17.930
Image 47 is a CCTV capture
made on 25th of January

14:17.980 --> 14:20.930
showing a figure known
informally as Balaclava Man.

14:20.980 --> 14:24.480
Now, have you determined that
this suspect is Michael Farmer?

14:25.380 --> 14:28.570
He's a sufficient match in
terms of body size and shape.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.770
Most likely, this is Michael Farmer.

14:30.820 --> 14:33.330
And can you tell me how
you went about determining

14:33.380 --> 14:35.970
whether or not to charge Michael Farmer?

14:36.020 --> 14:37.730
Standard protocol, sir.

14:37.780 --> 14:40.210
I spoke on the telephone
to the Senior Prosecutor

14:40.260 --> 14:41.650
in the Complex Case Unit.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.050
I outlined the evidence,

14:43.100 --> 14:45.370
and she authorised me
to charge the offender.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.410
And was there any other evidence

14:47.460 --> 14:50.860
that you brought to the attention
of the Senior Prosecutor?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.490
What evidence?

14:52.540 --> 14:54.650
Contrary evidence.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.130
- As the phone call wasn't recorded...
- Yeah, I know that, fella.

14:57.180 --> 15:00.280
That's why I'm asking the
organ grinder, not her monkey.

15:01.780 --> 15:04.090
I believe I've presented all the evidence.

15:04.140 --> 15:05.490
Believe?

15:05.540 --> 15:08.290
DCI Huntley strenuously denies
tampering with evidence.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.740
No-one's suggesting anything of the sort.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.170
More a matter of presentation.

15:13.220 --> 15:17.170
We viewed the MG5 and MG6 you
submitted electronically to the CPS.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.330
The MG6 didn't refer to any solid evidence

15:19.380 --> 15:21.370
that would undermine the prosecution case.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.610
Basically, you sold the
prosecutor on the evidence

15:23.660 --> 15:25.050
in favour of Farmer's guilt,

15:25.100 --> 15:26.850
played down the evidence against.

15:26.900 --> 15:30.370
Are you proposing that I should have
disregarded the powerful evidence

15:30.420 --> 15:31.770
against Michael Farmer,

15:31.820 --> 15:34.970
and released a potentially dangerous
offender back into the community?

15:35.020 --> 15:37.970
No, no. That is not what
we are talking about here,

15:38.020 --> 15:42.260
Detective Chief Inspector
Huntley, as well you know.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.690
We're not mind readers.

15:44.740 --> 15:47.610
We don't know whether Michael
Farmer is guilty or not.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.770
All that's expected of
us as police officers

15:49.820 --> 15:52.420
is that we do our duty
to the letter of the law.

15:53.580 --> 15:54.740
The letter.

15:58.660 --> 16:03.580
Now, you were a bit of a high flier
in your time, Roseanne, weren't you?

16:05.060 --> 16:06.450
Graduate entrant.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.050
Fast-tracked for promotion.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.330
DI before you were 30.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.680
Then you hit the wall.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.330
I started a family, sir.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.890
You stood still while other
people kept climbing the ladder.

16:16.940 --> 16:20.210
Operation Trapdoor's an
extremely high-profile inquiry.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.690
Get a result, it puts your
stalled career back on track.

16:22.740 --> 16:26.140
You were under pressure, weren't
you, Roseanne, to get a result?

16:26.380 --> 16:29.010
- No, sir.
- Pressure from the top?

16:29.060 --> 16:31.170
- No, sir.
- Come on.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.050
No movement for months?

16:33.100 --> 16:35.890
The press telling women the
streets aren't safe? Come off it.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.090
I discharged my duty correctly,

16:38.140 --> 16:40.370
and the matter is now in
the hands of the courts.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.530
The matter, DCI Huntley,

16:42.580 --> 16:46.370
is whether or not you knowingly
and willingly hoodwinked

16:46.420 --> 16:49.370
the Crown Prosecutor
into authorising charges

16:49.420 --> 16:50.730
against Michael Farmer,

16:50.780 --> 16:54.930
despite there being good
reason to doubt his guilt.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.530
I've got no doubt about
Michael Farmer's guilt.

16:57.580 --> 16:58.900
No?

17:01.060 --> 17:02.260
DS Arnott.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.490
Document 17 in your folders.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.890
Transcript of interview
with Michael Farmer.

17:07.940 --> 17:10.210
When asked to account for his
whereabouts around the time

17:10.260 --> 17:12.010
of Leonie Collersdale's disappearance,

17:12.060 --> 17:14.010
Mr Farmer referred to
a hospital admission.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.560
He misled my detectives.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.050
He's an emotionally and
intellectually vulnerable suspect

17:19.099 --> 17:20.369
who got a detail wrong.

17:20.420 --> 17:23.810
Follow-up by AC-12 proves Michael
Farmer was a hospital in-patient

17:23.859 --> 17:26.859
at the time of Leonie
Collersdale's disappearance.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.530
DS Neil Twyler reported to me

17:31.580 --> 17:34.210
that Michael Farmer had
given this new information

17:34.260 --> 17:35.860
in a post-charge interview.

17:38.260 --> 17:41.770
Michael Farmer's routine is
that he visits his grandmother

17:41.820 --> 17:46.340
between 7.30pm and 8.30pm every
night and starts work at 10pm.

17:47.500 --> 17:52.210
Farmer visited City General Hospital
at 11.30pm on the 25th of January.

17:52.260 --> 17:56.410
Leonie Collersdale was
last seen just after 9pm.

17:56.460 --> 17:59.090
This gave Farmer sufficient
time to carry out the offence,

17:59.140 --> 18:01.130
and subsequently to attend the hospital

18:01.180 --> 18:02.810
in the effort to fabricate an alibi.

18:02.860 --> 18:05.530
Furthermore, the hospital found
nothing wrong with Farmer.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.010
He was discharged,

18:07.060 --> 18:09.610
which fits with the whole thing
being a deliberate deception.

18:09.660 --> 18:10.890
No, no, no, no. No.

18:10.940 --> 18:13.570
Look, this is information you
should have known earlier,

18:13.620 --> 18:16.210
DCI Huntley, far, far earlier,

18:16.260 --> 18:18.610
and in my view, the
reason you didn't know it

18:18.660 --> 18:20.850
is because you were itching
to charge this suspect,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.330
come what may.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.330
That's an inflammatory accusation.

18:24.380 --> 18:27.090
Federation rep or not, you
will address me as "sir".

18:27.140 --> 18:29.650
And as far as I'm concerned, DCI Huntley,

18:29.700 --> 18:32.410
two hours is an extremely narrow margin

18:32.460 --> 18:34.610
for our fella to abduct that wee girl,

18:34.660 --> 18:36.250
transport her across town,

18:36.300 --> 18:37.450
do away with her,

18:37.500 --> 18:39.800
and then get himself up to the hospital.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.210
DS Arnott.

18:46.260 --> 18:47.620
Image 47 again.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.090
The man you say is Michael
Farmer, despite his partial alibi.

18:53.140 --> 18:55.370
Biometric analysis of the suspect.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.530
Estimation of the suspect's height
is limited by large error margins.

18:58.580 --> 19:01.250
However, the camera angle
permits accurate estimation

19:01.300 --> 19:02.610
of the suspect's shoe size.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.730
I haven't seen this before.
Where did you get this?

19:04.780 --> 19:06.730
The suspect wears size tens.

19:06.780 --> 19:08.570
Michael Farmer wears size eights.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.490
Is someone going to tell
me where this came from?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.970
Our source is confidential information.

19:13.020 --> 19:15.210
Item reference TJI-9,

19:15.260 --> 19:18.490
the previously mentioned boot print
detected at Michael Farmer's home.

19:18.540 --> 19:19.690
Size ten.

19:19.740 --> 19:22.050
No match to any footwear
belonging to Michael Farmer.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.000
There's the man you should
be looking for up there.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.210
Sir, I am very grateful
for this new information,

19:28.260 --> 19:32.290
and... I will order my team
to look into it without delay.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.930
Ah, well, that's great, but
the issue here, DCI Huntley,

19:34.980 --> 19:37.410
is whether you're fit to be
the one giving those orders.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.890
Now, in my opinion, you have
failed in your lawful duty

19:40.940 --> 19:42.890
to consider exculpatory evidence,

19:42.940 --> 19:45.490
and I am fearful that this
young fella, Michael Farmer,

19:45.540 --> 19:47.650
may suffer a miscarriage of justice.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.650
Therefore, I'm going to
recommend to your senior officer

19:50.700 --> 19:53.210
that a new Senior Investigating
Officer be appointed

19:53.260 --> 19:54.530
to Operation Trapdoor,

19:54.580 --> 19:56.130
and that you be reassigned.

19:56.180 --> 19:59.260
This interview is terminated.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.400
How many ops as big as
Trapdoor have you ever run?

20:19.980 --> 20:21.380
Thought so.

21:52.900 --> 21:56.250
'You were a bit of a high-flyer in
your time, Roseanne, weren't you?'

21:56.300 --> 22:00.570
'Graduate entrant. Fast-tracked for
promotion. DI before you were 30.'

22:00.620 --> 22:02.290
'Then you hit the wall.'

22:02.340 --> 22:03.730
'I started a family, sir.'

22:03.780 --> 22:07.010
Yeah, you stood still while other
people kept climbing the ladder.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.010
Operation Trapdoor is an
extremely high-profile inquiry.

22:10.060 --> 22:13.890
'Get a result and it puts your
stalled career back on track.'

22:13.940 --> 22:16.730
'This is Tim Ifield. Please
leave a message after the beep.'

22:16.780 --> 22:18.290
Tim, Steve Arnott.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.890
I know you're on days off, but
I need you to return my calls.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.250
We're looking deeper into the
evidence in the Farmer case

22:23.300 --> 22:24.490
and I need your input.

22:24.540 --> 22:27.290
Thanks again for the biometrics
-- they worked a treat, mate.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.580
Call me, OK?

22:30.300 --> 22:33.130
- All right. - All right.
- I didn't know you were in.

22:33.180 --> 22:36.970
I just listened to the DIR of
your interview with Huntley.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.090
She isn't the first SIO
to buff evidence...

22:39.140 --> 22:42.610
- She took it badly.
- Is that how it seemed to you?

22:42.660 --> 22:44.650
Congratulations!

22:44.700 --> 22:46.210
Ah, thanks, Maneet.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.690
What's that?

22:47.740 --> 22:51.650
Only gone and passed the
National Inspectors' Exam.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.650
- Congratulations.
- Cheers, mate.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.450
I didn't know you'd entered.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.170
Well, I kept shtum in
case I went down in flames.

22:59.220 --> 23:02.170
I know it's a bit soon, but I took so
long getting my act together to make DS,

23:02.220 --> 23:04.210
I'm not going to let things slide.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.660
- You're coming up on the rails.
- Yeah, you... - Better watch out.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.860
Well done, mate.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.300
Kate.

23:22.660 --> 23:23.650
Well.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.730
This is great news.
Congratulations. Well done.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.850
Thank you very much, sir.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.650
I mean, you know, it's great for you,

23:28.700 --> 23:30.810
reflects well on the
department, and, er...

23:30.860 --> 23:34.260
I shall be taking my fair share
of the credit, don't you worry.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.370
[But, you know...]

23:36.420 --> 23:39.250
Anyway, I think we should find a
bit of time and maybe, you know,

23:39.300 --> 23:41.090
we could discuss your future.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.090
Yeah, I'd like that, sir, thank you.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.210
I'm following the shift
pattern of my undercover,

23:45.260 --> 23:47.060
but I could do a drink one night?

23:48.460 --> 23:50.010
Erm...

23:50.060 --> 23:52.170
Or in the office next week.

23:52.220 --> 23:53.850
Yeah. That's the ticket.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.810
Anyway, look. Well done, again.

23:55.860 --> 23:58.340
- Thanks again, sir!
- Yeah, really well done.

24:13.420 --> 24:16.380
Look lively. New gaffer's ready.

24:31.820 --> 24:34.170
- Morning. - Morning,
sir. - Morning, sir.

24:34.220 --> 24:36.650
For those who don't know
me, I'm DCI Ian Buckells.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.130
And for those who don't read
the Chief Super's e-mails,

24:39.180 --> 24:41.280
I'm now running Operation Trapdoor.

24:43.580 --> 24:47.730
First order of business, a
possible alibi for Michael Farmer

24:47.780 --> 24:50.580
and some biometrics
relating to Balaclava Man.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.860
DCI Buckells?

24:59.460 --> 25:02.020
DS Arnott. Come with me, please, sir.

25:12.980 --> 25:15.650
- Now, you know who I am,
don't you, son? - Yes, sir.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.930
You were a DI at Kingsgate nick
during an undercover operation

25:18.980 --> 25:22.170
that was carried out by
one of my team in 2012.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.330
The officers she's working with
at present have all been vetted,

25:25.380 --> 25:27.050
but none of us could anticipate that

25:27.100 --> 25:30.210
the new senior investigating
officer was going to be you.

25:30.260 --> 25:33.410
Now, I do not want to pull
my officer off this job

25:33.460 --> 25:35.970
and I'm sure you don't
want to see all that time

25:36.020 --> 25:39.090
- and money and effort to go up
the spout, do you, son? - No, sir.

25:39.140 --> 25:42.900
Because if it did, the world and
his wife would know who's to blame.

25:45.140 --> 25:47.700
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir. That's the spirit.

25:54.460 --> 25:57.860
'This is Tim Ifield. Please
leave a message after the beep.'

26:00.020 --> 26:01.090
Hi.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.970
Has Tim Ifield come back to work yet?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.290
He hasn't been returning my calls.

26:05.340 --> 26:06.690
Negative.

26:06.740 --> 26:08.420
Received.

26:42.340 --> 26:43.730
'Hello?'

26:43.780 --> 26:45.810
Police officer. I'm sorry to trouble you.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.260
Could you let me into
the building, please?

26:50.100 --> 26:52.400
Thanks, miss. Stay where you are, please.

27:04.180 --> 27:06.060
Tim? Steve Arnott!

27:08.540 --> 27:10.260
Tim? Steve!

27:11.420 --> 27:14.660
- When did you see him last?
- Not for a few days.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.080
Stay out and control access. In with me.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.970
You're not getting anywhere near this.

28:06.020 --> 28:07.850
Calm down, mate, what do you expect?

28:07.900 --> 28:10.010
Crime's up on the box and
it's one of their own.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.490
What's it look like up there?

28:11.540 --> 28:13.010
You've got an interest and I get that.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.810
This should be handled by an external team

28:14.860 --> 28:16.290
if only for welfare issues.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.690
We're three DSs and one
DC. Who put you in charge?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.250
This has all gone through my gaffer.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.700
You want to take it up
with him, be my guest.

28:27.700 --> 28:31.050
What did you expect, mate?
We had to tell our gaffer.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.610
- Who's in charge here?
- I am. - You're relieved.

28:33.660 --> 28:35.250
Wait. What authority do you have?

28:35.300 --> 28:39.010
This isn't Operation Trapdoor. I'm
Duty DCI on Major Violent Crime.

28:39.060 --> 28:41.010
Jodie, can you get a
decision log up and running.

28:41.060 --> 28:44.530
- Yes, ma'am. - Neil, scene log.
- I've already got a scene log going.

28:44.580 --> 28:47.690
Once we've got the scene log
up and running, you can sign in,

28:47.740 --> 28:49.090
we'll go up for a recce.

28:49.140 --> 28:50.850
No way! No. No. You're not going in.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.890
Great. Please, stand down.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.890
You've been given a lawful order.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.580
If DCI Huntley doesn't
put you on paper, I will.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.610
Principal point of entry.

29:20.660 --> 29:23.730
Damage due to forced entry by
police officers this afternoon

29:23.780 --> 29:26.100
under Section 17, Preservation of Life.

29:35.220 --> 29:37.810
Looks like the offender
did a pretty decent job

29:37.860 --> 29:39.660
of cleaning up after himself.

29:41.060 --> 29:43.450
You OK?

29:43.500 --> 29:45.020
Go ahead.

29:47.580 --> 29:49.250
These tools, whatever they were for,

29:49.300 --> 29:50.860
haven't been used.

30:12.660 --> 30:15.360
Cause of death looks
like the neck laceration.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.500
Nicked the jugular vein.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.450
Not much blood on his
clothing, considering.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.810
He'll have taken a while to die.

30:27.860 --> 30:32.250
From the signs of a clean-up,
he could've been moving around.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.850
Distal portions of second,

30:33.900 --> 30:35.450
third and fourth digits of

30:35.500 --> 30:37.460
right hand have been amputated.

30:42.460 --> 30:44.610
I'll just have a look round
the other rooms quickly

30:44.660 --> 30:47.810
- and then I want to get the
team in, if that's OK? - Fine.

30:47.860 --> 30:50.580
- FC. You're good to come up.
- 'Received.'

30:52.220 --> 30:54.210
You're taking it worse than me.

30:54.260 --> 30:56.330
I didn't realise you were so close.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.890
Just when it's someone you know.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.100
Senseless.

31:07.060 --> 31:09.050
Action area seems to be round the body.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.330
Not much in the way of
spatter, but swab what you can,

31:11.380 --> 31:13.500
plus all potential points of entry.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.570
DCI Huntley.

31:35.620 --> 31:39.060
We should talk outside and let
the forensics crack on, yeah?

31:40.180 --> 31:41.450
Blood splatter.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.930
Brilliant, Kevin.

31:42.980 --> 31:46.700
- Let's get this spatter photographed,
marked and swabbed. - On it.

31:47.860 --> 31:49.890
DCI Huntley.

31:49.940 --> 31:51.490
Very good, sir.

31:51.540 --> 31:55.040
Well done, everyone, I'll be on
the radio outside if you need me.

32:02.140 --> 32:05.020
Yeah, it's OK. I've got
this, DS Arnott. Thank you.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.610
Are you feeling unwell, DCI Huntley?

32:11.660 --> 32:14.530
He was one of our own and it's
already been a stressful week.

32:14.580 --> 32:17.170
Yes. In which case, DS
Arnott's point about the value

32:17.220 --> 32:19.690
of an outside investigation is well made.

32:19.740 --> 32:21.570
With respect, sir, I disagree.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.930
This is our patch, our
victim, our specialisation.

32:24.980 --> 32:28.410
In my considered opinion, we're
best qualified to handle this.

32:28.460 --> 32:32.490
Hang on a second. I'm the senior
ranking officer here, darling.

32:32.540 --> 32:35.410
Yes, you are, and I'd thank you
to use gender-neutral language,

32:35.460 --> 32:37.650
and remind you that this
is a fresh investigation

32:37.700 --> 32:40.330
bearing no relation to Operation Trapdoor.

32:40.380 --> 32:42.690
You're at liberty to take this
up with my supervision team.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.170
But in the meantime,

32:44.220 --> 32:47.720
I'm going to get on with finding
the bastard who did this. Sir.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.970
Look, we all knew Tim Ifield,

32:52.020 --> 32:54.330
but it's important we don't let
our emotions get on top of us.

32:54.380 --> 32:56.050
We still need to do
everything by the book.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.290
That wee girl has just
turned the corner with me.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.890
No way can she run this, sir.

33:00.940 --> 33:02.330
All right, back to work.

33:02.380 --> 33:05.530
Tim Ifield was our best asset
in clearing Michael Farmer.

33:05.580 --> 33:09.490
- We've just lost him.
- Superintendent Hastings.

33:09.540 --> 33:12.820
Look, why don't you take
yourself off home. Yeah?

33:15.300 --> 33:19.140
Nice one, ma'am. AC-12 leaving
with their tail between their legs.

33:51.740 --> 33:55.780
That's the swab of worktop blood
spatter. Item reference KRG-13.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.170
'Yeah?'

34:29.219 --> 34:31.250
'Tim was convinced there
was a conspiracy to protect

34:31.300 --> 34:32.690
'a suspect in the offences'

34:32.739 --> 34:34.489
Michael Farmer's been charged with.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.489
Sounds like a motive to kill him.

34:36.540 --> 34:39.170
Or another suspect wouldn't
be the only person to benefit.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.530
What do you mean?

34:40.580 --> 34:43.130
Is there any way Huntley could
have known about Tim coming to us?

34:43.179 --> 34:44.730
'Not that I know of.'

34:44.780 --> 34:47.210
And you said in her interview
she was repeatedly caught out

34:47.260 --> 34:49.530
by evidence supplied by Tim.

34:49.580 --> 34:52.620
'I don't think she had any
idea Tim was talking to us.'

34:54.219 --> 34:56.409
'Can't talk now, I'm at work.'

34:56.460 --> 34:58.820
- See you.
- Cheers. See you.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.650
- Is all the evidence back
from the crime scene? - Yeah.

36:39.700 --> 36:40.930
Would you do me a huge favour

36:40.980 --> 36:43.580
and see if they found a
laptop or mobile phone?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.460
Yeah, OK.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.300
- Hey, Kev.
- All right, mate.

37:48.860 --> 37:51.760
Yeah, but don't tell me you
couldn't use the exercise.

37:53.220 --> 37:54.770
Cheeky bugger.

37:54.820 --> 37:58.220
You can talk, a bit of running
around wouldn't do you any harm.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.930
Night, night, mate.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.540
Good night.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.370
Sorry.

38:11.420 --> 38:14.900
- No mobile or laptop found.
- Oh, well. Thanks, anyway.

38:16.860 --> 38:19.660
- Long night.
- No worries. Night, night.

38:58.780 --> 39:01.650
I thought I heard your car ages ago.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.900
I got called out again straightaway.

39:05.380 --> 39:06.820
I didn't want to wake you.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.690
Fingerprints and DNA
detected at Tim's flat

39:21.740 --> 39:24.450
all matched Tim Ifield,
no-one else, unfortunately.

39:24.500 --> 39:27.420
What about the blood spatter
found on the worktop?

39:30.220 --> 39:34.980
KRG-13. Sorry, ma'am, that matched
to Tim Ifield's blood as well.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.170
OK.

39:38.220 --> 39:40.570
A thorough search of the flat
failed to recover Tim Ifield's

39:40.620 --> 39:42.570
mobile phone and laptop computer.

39:42.620 --> 39:46.250
So we can assume that the killer
stole the phone and the laptop.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.770
Is there a track on the phone?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.730
The last recorded position was Tim's flat,

39:49.780 --> 39:52.330
so whoever took it was smart
enough to switch it off.

39:52.380 --> 39:53.900
That's frustrating.

39:55.860 --> 39:59.050
Maybe Tim had been in
communication with the killer?

39:59.100 --> 40:02.490
- I've been in touch with his
service providers... - Yes?

40:02.540 --> 40:04.370
Someone's come up in his contacts.

40:04.420 --> 40:05.820
Who?

40:17.380 --> 40:19.210
Who?

40:19.260 --> 40:21.410
'We're going to record
this, Hana. Is that OK?

40:21.460 --> 40:23.730
- 'Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

40:23.780 --> 40:26.650
- 'Would you like a tea or a coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.370
'OK, Hana. I'm DC Jodie Taylor.'

40:28.420 --> 40:30.770
The limitations of your
secondment have been agreed.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.650
Timothy Ifield's murder
is nothing to do with you.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.010
With respect, ma'am,

40:35.060 --> 40:37.370
Hana Reznikova was supposedly
the intended third victim.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.690
If anything's a link to my case, this is.

40:39.740 --> 40:42.890
'We'd like to ask you some questions
about a man named Timothy Ifield.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.770
'Do you know the name?'

40:44.820 --> 40:46.090
'Yes.

40:46.140 --> 40:47.970
'How do you know him?'

40:48.020 --> 40:51.210
He was a customer at
the cafe where I work.

40:51.260 --> 40:53.730
And I leave out business
cards for my cleaning work

40:53.780 --> 40:55.490
and he told me he needed a cleaner.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.650
And how many times did you go to his flat?

40:57.700 --> 40:59.050
Only once.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.570
He told me to come when he was
home so he could explain to me

41:01.620 --> 41:04.170
what work he needed me to do
and we could agree the price.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.730
And did you see Timothy Ifield that day?

41:06.780 --> 41:08.850
- No.
- Why not?

41:08.900 --> 41:11.010
He texted me.

41:11.060 --> 41:13.410
'We have a text message
from Tim's phone to yours.

41:13.460 --> 41:14.770
' "Ill. Don't come in." '

41:14.820 --> 41:16.050
Yes.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.370
'A few seconds later there
was a second message.

41:18.420 --> 41:21.250
' "Sorry! Will call later
to fix new appointment."

41:21.300 --> 41:22.850
'Yes.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.690
- 'And did he call?
- No.

41:24.740 --> 41:28.690
'I suppose I thought he'd changed
his mind about the cleaning.'

41:28.740 --> 41:32.250
Did you know Tim Ifield in any other way?

41:32.300 --> 41:35.290
Did you know what work he did?
Anything else he was involved in?

41:35.340 --> 41:36.820
No.

41:38.060 --> 41:42.770
'Tim was on site the night you were
rescued from Michael Farmer's house.'

41:42.820 --> 41:44.780
Do you remember him at all, Hana?

41:47.540 --> 41:48.930
No.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.810
Whatever Hana knew, Tim
definitely knew who Hana was.

41:51.860 --> 41:53.850
Yes.

41:53.900 --> 41:57.130
What was he doing, getting
her round his flat?

41:57.180 --> 42:00.530
This has come as a shock for all of us.

42:00.580 --> 42:02.980
Thanks for letting me in on this, ma'am.

42:04.300 --> 42:07.850
Look, I know we've had our
differences, but for what it's worth

42:07.900 --> 42:10.530
I don't think they'd have replaced
you as SIO if you were a bloke.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.010
'.. locks had been tampered with?

42:12.060 --> 42:13.290
'No, I don't think so.

42:13.340 --> 42:16.640
'Have you received any unusual
calls or e-mails since then?

42:17.500 --> 42:19.050
'No.'

42:19.100 --> 42:21.170
Huntley's relented a bit
as far as I'm concerned

42:21.220 --> 42:23.970
and I've managed to get eyes
on Tim's communication history.

42:24.020 --> 42:26.290
Fortunately, nothing connecting him to us.

42:26.340 --> 42:28.690
Turns out that Tim was a
bit of a security nut,

42:28.740 --> 42:32.370
so there was nothing backed up
online either, according to his ISP.

42:32.420 --> 42:35.290
There's nothing suggesting
he alerted anyone but us about

42:35.340 --> 42:38.370
the possibility of another suspect
in Michael Farmer's offences.

42:38.420 --> 42:41.170
Also zero communication
between Tim and Huntley in

42:41.220 --> 42:42.690
the time before his death.

42:42.740 --> 42:44.770
Their last communication was professional,

42:44.820 --> 42:48.170
e-mails about forensics sent
on the night of Farmer's arrest.

42:48.220 --> 42:49.730
Since then, nothing.

42:49.780 --> 42:51.210
Right.

42:51.260 --> 42:53.010
Is there any clues as
to what Tim was doing

42:53.060 --> 42:54.770
getting Hana to come to his flat?

42:54.820 --> 42:57.090
No. It's a blank. We're running
background checks on Hana,

42:57.140 --> 42:59.410
but she still appears
to be an innocent party.

42:59.460 --> 43:01.330
Her explanation holds up as to why she was

43:01.380 --> 43:03.130
the last person contacted by Tim.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.650
Either Tim sent the text himself,

43:04.700 --> 43:06.570
or, if he was dead
already, the killer did.

43:06.620 --> 43:09.130
Well, that fits with the phone
being stolen by the killer.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.570
Tim had a hi-tech security
system installed in his flat,

43:11.620 --> 43:13.530
and the cameras fed
direct to his computer.

43:13.580 --> 43:15.530
There's no images stored anywhere else.

43:15.580 --> 43:17.970
It's another reason we need to
find his phone and computer.

43:18.020 --> 43:22.340
- Yeah, we do. - Night, mate. - Night.

43:45.180 --> 43:48.690
Hi, it's DC Taylor again.
I have an ISP address.

43:48.740 --> 43:52.370
It's timothy.j.ifield.

43:52.420 --> 43:55.300
Ifield is I-F-I-E-L-D.

44:00.060 --> 44:01.500
I'll phone you back.

44:03.180 --> 44:05.250
No. Please, as you were.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.770
Firstly, the Chief Superintendent
and I would like to express

44:08.820 --> 44:12.570
our condolences for the loss of
one of your forensic coordinators.

44:12.620 --> 44:14.690
DCI Huntley, good to see you.

44:14.740 --> 44:17.370
We're going to do everything
in our power to find his killer.

44:17.420 --> 44:20.090
We're delving into his personal
life, sir, explore that angle.

44:20.140 --> 44:23.650
Also looking at the possibility this
is some kind of revenge attack, sir.

44:23.700 --> 44:26.370
Recently released offenders Tim
might have helped put away.

44:26.420 --> 44:29.330
He was such a decent,
hard-working bloke, sir.

44:29.380 --> 44:31.980
- It's so hard to fathom a grudge.
- Of course.

44:33.260 --> 44:37.650
- Right, well. Carry on.
- We'll find the culprit, sir.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.450
I wonder if I could have
a moment in private, sir?

44:40.500 --> 44:43.090
You've not responded to any of
my calls regarding the decision

44:43.140 --> 44:44.570
to replace me.

44:44.620 --> 44:48.500
You need clarity. But it's
AC-12. It's out of my hands.

44:49.900 --> 44:54.170
I'm on a tight schedule. I'm sorry.
Moving on. Operation Trapdoor.

44:54.220 --> 44:56.730
- Sir.
- Ah. Any new leads, Buckells?

44:56.780 --> 44:59.010
The body parts we found
are the partial remains of

44:59.060 --> 45:02.410
Leonie Collersdale, the second
prostitute that went missing.

45:02.460 --> 45:05.170
Unfortunately they were
clean of anyone else's DNA.

45:05.220 --> 45:06.850
Small mercies,

45:06.900 --> 45:10.100
at least we're allowed to
call them prostitutes again.

45:16.260 --> 45:18.450
Got you a big pint of that cats' piss

45:18.500 --> 45:20.900
that you young fellas
seem to like so much.

45:22.020 --> 45:26.180
- That whisky's probably older than me.
- Aye. And all the better for it.

45:30.300 --> 45:31.930
No, I just thought this would be a...

45:31.980 --> 45:34.680
a better way for us to
discuss your ambitions.

45:35.620 --> 45:37.330
I know that if I put you on a case,

45:37.380 --> 45:39.730
you'll see it through to the
bitter end, come what may.

45:39.780 --> 45:43.340
- Thank you, sir.
- And stepping up to inspector, it's, er...

45:44.620 --> 45:47.210
.. same proposition.
There's no half measures.

45:47.260 --> 45:49.780
I'm ready and able,
sir. Whatever it takes.

45:55.460 --> 45:58.650
Do you mind if I ask if you're
having a meeting with Kate, too?

45:58.700 --> 46:00.610
I can hardly meet her for a drink, can I?

46:00.660 --> 46:03.330
An attractive young woman
like that. How would it look?

46:03.380 --> 46:06.980
I might as well be seen running
around with one of Pan's People.

46:10.420 --> 46:13.860
- Anyway, it's good to talk, sir.
- Oh, yeah. - Your health. - Yeah.

47:11.820 --> 47:14.460
- Tim Ifield's postmortem report.
- Great.

47:17.780 --> 47:20.410
Cause of death was
exsanguination, following

47:20.460 --> 47:22.530
a wound to the neck that
severed his jugular vein.

47:22.580 --> 47:24.370
Now, it's a shallow
wound so possibly there's

47:24.420 --> 47:26.770
a question mark over the level of intent.

47:26.820 --> 47:28.650
Also a partial thickness
burn on the left hand

47:28.700 --> 47:29.850
with traces of cooking oil.

47:29.900 --> 47:32.090
The shallowness of the
burn, though, suggests this

47:32.140 --> 47:34.890
was accidental and related to a
frying pan found at the scene.

47:34.940 --> 47:37.290
Furthermore, defensive
wounds on the hands support

47:37.340 --> 47:38.850
a struggle of some kind.

47:38.900 --> 47:41.690
Bloodstaining of Tim's clothing
was disproportionately low,

47:41.740 --> 47:44.370
suggesting an outer layer
of clothing was removed.

47:44.420 --> 47:47.530
And white, high-density polythene
fibres detected on Tim's clothing

47:47.580 --> 47:50.210
suggest he was wearing a forensic
oversuit at the time of death.

47:50.260 --> 47:52.490
As you know, sir, they're
designed not to lint,

47:52.540 --> 47:54.770
which suggests he was
involved in a struggle.

47:54.820 --> 47:57.130
It sounds like the killer
was worried that the suit

47:57.180 --> 47:59.490
- was contaminated with his DNA.
- Most likely, sir.

47:59.540 --> 48:01.490
His fingertips were amputated postmortem,

48:01.540 --> 48:04.050
presumably as part of the
killer's forensic clean-up.

48:04.100 --> 48:06.890
So we're surmising that Tim tried
to grab a handful of his assailant.

48:06.940 --> 48:10.250
Yes, sir. Tim might've realised
his wound was fatal and

48:10.300 --> 48:12.650
he probably did his best to
contaminate the killer with

48:12.700 --> 48:15.130
his blood and to get some skin
cells under his fingernails.

48:15.180 --> 48:17.290
Unfortunately for us, the
killer was wise to it.

48:17.340 --> 48:21.250
He disposed of the clothes and
then he disposed of the fingers.

48:21.300 --> 48:24.330
There are no witnesses to anyone
entering or leaving the premises.

48:24.380 --> 48:28.450
- But we can construct a basic
profile of the killer. - Very good.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.970
Pre-mortem pattern of injuries
suggests the killer and Tim

48:31.020 --> 48:33.090
got into some kind of altercation.

48:33.140 --> 48:34.570
And he took the time to carry out

48:34.620 --> 48:36.810
a comprehensive clean-up
of the crime scene.

48:36.860 --> 48:39.460
The only anomaly is he
didn't remove the body.

48:40.980 --> 48:45.170
- What are you thinking, son?
- The killer was disturbed.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.930
Most likely this was Hana Reznikova
when she arrived at the flat

48:47.980 --> 48:49.580
to carry out cleaning work.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.730
And something else?

48:53.780 --> 48:56.490
Or the killer was incapable
of lifting the body.

48:56.540 --> 48:59.300
Small, or female, or both.

49:02.780 --> 49:04.250
It's only a possibility, sir.

49:04.300 --> 49:07.450
We are in no position to consider
Roz Huntley as a suspect,

49:07.500 --> 49:09.330
not without cause.

49:09.380 --> 49:12.610
- I think we should keep an open mind, sir.
- Well, that's a given.

49:12.660 --> 49:14.850
We should run a parallel
investigation, sir,

49:14.900 --> 49:18.210
into Huntley and into Tim's
murder, with zero reciprocity.

49:18.260 --> 49:21.370
- Kill two birds with one stone.
- Kate's close to her.

49:21.420 --> 49:24.180
Let's see what she brings
back first, all right?

49:44.060 --> 49:46.050
DS Twyler from Polk Avenue Station.

49:46.100 --> 49:50.420
I'm chasing up an admission on
25th of January. Michael Farmer.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.850
Ma'am, I need to follow up

49:54.900 --> 49:56.730
on a couple of points from your interview.

49:56.780 --> 50:00.290
Put them in writing. You'll get
an answer in ten working days.

50:00.340 --> 50:03.980
The longer our inquiry takes, the
longer you're out in the cold.

50:06.500 --> 50:08.140
What do you want?

50:10.420 --> 50:13.820
How would you describe your
relationship with Tim Ifield?

50:16.340 --> 50:18.450
We were colleagues.

50:18.500 --> 50:21.770
Not close. But we respected each other.

50:21.820 --> 50:24.570
Certainly, from my side,
that's how it seemed.

50:24.620 --> 50:26.500
You think he thought different?

50:28.140 --> 50:31.090
- Who knows what people think of each other?
- That your answer?

50:31.140 --> 50:34.210
We didn't talk much, didn't socialise.

50:34.260 --> 50:36.060
So you've never been to his flat?

50:37.220 --> 50:40.610
Yes. To investigate his murder.

50:40.660 --> 50:42.420
I mean while he was alive.

50:43.700 --> 50:44.740
No.

50:46.380 --> 50:47.850
OK.

50:47.900 --> 50:50.300
Thanks, ma'am, that's been very helpful.

50:53.620 --> 50:56.850
Ideally, I'd like to come up
to the hospital and talk to

50:56.900 --> 50:58.890
'anyone who can account
for the whereabouts

50:58.940 --> 51:01.140
'of Mr Farmer on the night of the 25th...'

51:47.900 --> 51:50.810
- Oh, OK, that's a pain.
- Rupal?

51:50.860 --> 51:53.050
Sorry, is this a good time?

51:53.100 --> 51:55.420
- E-mail me when you've
got it. - OK. - Thanks.

51:57.020 --> 51:59.770
- What's up? - I heard we
didn't find any foreign DNA

51:59.820 --> 52:01.610
on Leonie Collersdale's body.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.660
Pisser. We did a thorough job.

52:07.620 --> 52:09.520
Would you mind having another go?

52:10.380 --> 52:13.570
DCI Buckells is SIO now.

52:13.620 --> 52:14.850
Sorry.

52:14.900 --> 52:16.700
Rupal.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.140
I'm not broadcasting this...

52:21.540 --> 52:24.440
.. but I'm asking for it
in relation to Tim's murder.

52:25.460 --> 52:26.970
I don't see the connection.

52:27.020 --> 52:31.090
At this stage of the inquiry, it's
highly confidential. I'm sorry.

52:31.140 --> 52:34.210
- Would you mind?
- Uh, sure.

52:34.260 --> 52:35.730
OK.

52:35.780 --> 52:36.740
Thanks, Rupal.

52:55.660 --> 52:56.650
Come in.

52:56.700 --> 52:57.820
Ah, Kate.

52:58.900 --> 53:01.450
Yes, thanks for coming in. Hmm.

53:01.500 --> 53:03.530
I've considered your application.

53:03.580 --> 53:06.890
And you really are a tremendous
asset to this department,

53:06.940 --> 53:09.690
but I just think you need to
develop your leadership qualities

53:09.740 --> 53:12.330
a bit more before I can
support you for inspector.

53:12.380 --> 53:13.570
I'm sorry.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.250
Right. I see, sir.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.900
Will it be Steve?

53:18.100 --> 53:20.730
Well, look, in my view, he just has
those extra years under his belt.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.930
You know what I mean. It
was a close-run thing, Kate,

53:22.980 --> 53:25.900
- very close indeed.
- Thank you, sir.

53:48.660 --> 53:51.890
- That raises the possibility
that this person... - Morning.

53:51.940 --> 53:55.840
.. is involved in the murders of
the two prostitutes and Tim Ifield.

54:00.180 --> 54:03.090
Any further progress on finding the
rest of Leonie Collersdale's body?

54:03.140 --> 54:06.730
Sorry, boss, no more biological
material was found at the scene.

54:06.780 --> 54:10.170
Although no more biological material
was found at the site of Leonie

54:10.220 --> 54:14.340
Collersdale's body parts, there has
been a significant new finding...

54:15.340 --> 54:18.580
- Yes? - I'm not sure I should
say it in front of everyone.

54:20.340 --> 54:23.340
This was from further tests
ordered by DCI Huntley.

54:29.340 --> 54:32.700
- What are you doing interfering
with my operation? - I'm not.

54:35.980 --> 54:38.050
So what is this significant new finding?

54:38.100 --> 54:40.500
Everyone needs to be across this. Come on.

54:52.500 --> 54:54.250
Go ahead, Rupal.

54:54.300 --> 54:58.130
A trace of foreign DNA was found on
Leonie Collersdale's partial torso.

54:58.180 --> 55:02.780
- ID? - Yes. It matches to Tim Ifield.

55:10.380 --> 55:14.020
- What we just heard does not
leave this room. - Jesus Christ!

55:29.380 --> 55:30.420
Stop.

55:35.020 --> 55:36.060
Move.

55:44.820 --> 55:49.500
- Beast's made a right mess for himself.
- I didn't do it.

55:50.540 --> 55:54.050
- Someone else must have.
- Beast makes a mess,

55:54.100 --> 55:57.340
- Beast gets to live in it.
- I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

56:02.100 --> 56:05.730
We're all in shock. That's why
I wanted to include you, sir,

56:05.780 --> 56:07.770
before someone makes a rash move.

56:07.820 --> 56:11.330
Thank you, Roz. Do you
have a hypothesis yet?

56:11.380 --> 56:14.050
Naturally, we're asking ourselves
questions about Tim Ifield's

56:14.100 --> 56:16.650
private life but, frankly, sir,

56:16.700 --> 56:19.290
I'm struggling to make
sense of it all myself.

56:19.340 --> 56:25.330
- Understood. Absolutely. Well done
for keeping a lid on this. - Sir.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.780
- Thank you, Roz.
- If I may, sir?

56:30.140 --> 56:31.290
There's also the question

56:31.340 --> 56:33.370
of who was the source of
AC-12's case against me.

56:33.420 --> 56:36.570
In my interview, they said it
was confidential but we found

56:36.620 --> 56:39.130
Tim's flat full of conspiracy theories

56:39.180 --> 56:42.680
and it occurs to me the most
likely informant was Tim Ifield.

56:44.500 --> 56:48.130
In which case, his credibility
is completely undermined.

56:48.180 --> 56:50.410
I'm worried Tim Ifield

56:50.460 --> 56:53.330
was deliberately confounding the
investigation to cover his tracks.

56:53.380 --> 56:55.890
And now AC-12 are doing his work for him.

56:55.940 --> 56:57.330
Between you and me,

56:57.380 --> 57:00.810
I was never happy with AC-12's
recommendation to replace you.

57:00.860 --> 57:02.250
Thank you, sir.

57:02.300 --> 57:06.010
Still, Operation Trapdoor
belongs to Ian Buckells now,

57:06.060 --> 57:08.530
and he's looking at evidence
exculpating Michael Farmer.

57:08.580 --> 57:11.250
Will he find any, do you think?

57:11.300 --> 57:14.090
The best he's got is a boot
print from Farmer's home

57:14.140 --> 57:17.210
and that, in itself, does nothing
to overturn the weight of

57:17.260 --> 57:19.530
inculpatory evidence
against Michael Farmer,

57:19.580 --> 57:23.850
even if we do now have to examine
Tim Ifield's role in all this.

57:23.900 --> 57:28.010
AC-12's inquiry seriously
threatens the force's credibility.

57:28.060 --> 57:31.730
And if I were to go against
their recommendations...

57:31.780 --> 57:33.500
if I were to reinstate you...?

57:35.300 --> 57:36.810
I'm convinced Tim Ifield's murder

57:36.860 --> 57:39.330
and Michael Farmer's crimes are connected.

57:39.380 --> 57:42.370
I believe I've demonstrated
complete discretion.

57:42.420 --> 57:44.930
No-one looks good if it comes
out one of our forensic staff

57:44.980 --> 57:46.210
tampered with evidence.

57:46.260 --> 57:49.100
No-one looks good if it comes
out we've charged the wrong man.

57:50.305 --> 57:56.258
