00:37.127 --> 00:39.994
Father Nicolas! Are you there;

00:44.095 --> 00:45.790
What on earth is the matter?

00:45.815 --> 00:48.965
Please come at once, Father.
He's getting worse.

00:49.481 --> 00:52.981
<i>Not so long ago in the village
of La Mancha, lived a gentleman</i>

00:53.006 --> 00:56.380
<i>who read books of chivalry with
so much passion every hour of the</i>

00:56.405 --> 00:58.631
<i>day and night that
he quite lost his mind.</i>

00:59.280 --> 01:06.459
By the golden helmet of Mambrino,
I swear to lay you to waste!

01:20.684 --> 01:22.164
Freston?

01:23.070 --> 01:25.266
Be gone! Spawn of Satan!

01:27.280 --> 01:28.680
What are you doing?

01:28.920 --> 01:31.700
I was about to slay
El Sabio Freston,

01:31.720 --> 01:34.300
but his defense is impeccable.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.994
I will not underestimate you again.

01:38.083 --> 01:42.300
The forces of darkness
infest our land like the plague.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.296
There is too much
injustice, poverty, cruelty.

01:46.468 --> 01:48.375
We all do what we can.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.357
I must do more.

01:53.316 --> 01:54.939
Will the moon be
full tonight, father?

01:54.964 --> 01:57.685
- I can't wait any longer.
- I... I think it will.

01:58.130 --> 02:02.060
When the full moon was full and
the wind blew from the north,

02:02.080 --> 02:06.295
a bold Sir Galahad set forth.

02:08.691 --> 02:09.965
What should we do?

02:10.137 --> 02:12.220
He hasn't eaten or slept in days.

02:12.598 --> 02:15.500
All he does is read those
wretched books you gave him.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.399
There's no harm
in a little literature.

02:19.029 --> 02:24.376
These are just some dark clouds
passing through his brain.

02:32.127 --> 02:35.110
<i>One night when
the moon was full,</i>

02:35.135 --> 02:38.330
<i>this gentleman had a
strange and wonderful idea.</i>

03:20.320 --> 03:21.869
Yes!

03:22.608 --> 03:23.908
Yes!

03:26.213 --> 03:28.555
Uncle! I made you breakfast.

03:44.801 --> 03:45.996
Uncle!

03:46.339 --> 03:47.534
Wait!

03:48.379 --> 03:49.733
Yes!

03:51.520 --> 03:53.159
Where are you going?

03:54.080 --> 03:56.595
- Yes!
- Uncle, stop!

03:57.574 --> 03:59.780
- Antonia...
- Why didn't you stop him?

03:59.948 --> 04:03.035
- Stop who?
- My uncle, of course.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.091
Oh, I... I brought you these.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Antonia.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.934
Alonso?

04:18.885 --> 04:20.372
Alonso Quixano!

04:20.447 --> 04:26.556
Are you addressing me, sir?
I am Don Quixote of La Mancha.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.025
Don Quixote of La Mancha?

04:29.157 --> 04:31.432
Where are you going, my friend?

04:31.555 --> 04:36.949
I seek a worthy Lord
who will dub me as a knight.

04:38.884 --> 04:42.516
<i>He rode out to travel the
country in search of adventure.</i>

04:42.675 --> 04:46.110
<i>He would punish the guilty,
he helped the less fortunate.</i>

04:46.406 --> 04:50.029
<i>and become the most noble
knight the world has ever seen.</i>

04:50.560 --> 04:53.791
A noble knight needs
a steed with a noble name.

04:54.118 --> 05:00.815
Because you are a strong and valiant
creature, I shall call you Rocinante.

05:01.954 --> 05:03.547
Rocinante!

05:05.048 --> 05:06.084
Come!

05:15.165 --> 05:18.317
Rocinante! Look! A castle.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.222
My lady.

05:44.834 --> 05:48.218
Welcome to
El Toboso, Señor.

05:48.507 --> 05:51.624
My Lord, I humbly request to rest myself

05:51.819 --> 05:57.751
and my horse for the night,
in this most majestic of castles.

05:58.610 --> 06:02.001
We will provide
for your every desire.

06:02.141 --> 06:08.495
Fine food, wine, perhaps
a tight sheath for your sword.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.182
Come on! Take care
of this gentleman.

06:12.222 --> 06:14.293
I don't pay your mouth to gawk.

06:19.936 --> 06:24.076
Virtuous maidens of
such class and dignity.

06:24.266 --> 06:27.821
- How may I thank you?
- Usual method is cash.

06:31.076 --> 06:32.685
Tender morsel.

06:43.283 --> 06:46.682
I trust the meal was
to your satisfaction?

06:46.775 --> 06:48.620
Oh! It's fit for a king.

06:48.877 --> 06:51.633
We live only to serve you.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.435
What's your pleasure now, Señor?

07:00.280 --> 07:05.560
I shall not rise from this spot
until you grant me what I ask.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.940
What's that?

07:08.960 --> 07:14.165
My Lord, I beg you
to dub me... a knight.

07:17.423 --> 07:19.420
You want me to dub you?

07:19.455 --> 07:24.137
So that I may roam this world,
protecting those in need...

07:24.489 --> 07:27.636
heeding the trumpet call of chivalry.

07:28.683 --> 07:30.322
This is not a joke?

07:31.523 --> 07:33.640
You may use my sword.

07:47.840 --> 07:54.530
My Lord, you have made me...
the happiest of knights.

07:54.666 --> 07:57.261
How may I thank you for this honor?

07:57.998 --> 08:02.420
If the happiest of
knights could settle his bill,

08:02.944 --> 08:04.860
that would be thanks enough.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.236
Alas I'm sorry sir

08:07.960 --> 08:11.317
it is not customary for
knights to carry money.

08:12.829 --> 08:15.023
No no. No!

08:18.040 --> 08:20.900
A true knight would pay his debts.

08:21.037 --> 08:23.154
Inhospitable ruffian.

08:24.136 --> 08:27.669
May your castle walls
crumble like moulding cake.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.179
Are you hurt, Señor?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.877
Here. Let me help you up.

08:50.838 --> 08:52.470
Dulcinea.

08:54.345 --> 08:55.825
What did you say?

08:56.538 --> 09:00.262
Dulcinea.
That must be your name.

09:01.176 --> 09:05.011
For you are truly the
sweetest creature in this world.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.854
- Where the hell are you, girl?
- You must leave at once.

09:14.261 --> 09:16.870
My father will be
angry if he sees you.

09:18.069 --> 09:19.628
My sword.

09:23.884 --> 09:26.575
Will you honor me
with some token, fair lady?

09:26.716 --> 09:27.921
A token?

09:28.154 --> 09:31.727
To be reminded of you
wherever I roam.

09:32.840 --> 09:39.060
- Well, it's only a wash rag, but...
- I'd sooner lose a limb...

09:39.080 --> 09:41.865
than be parted from
such a precious favor.

09:42.287 --> 09:45.545
Farewell, Dulcinea.
I ride in your honor.

09:45.570 --> 09:49.160
For you are truly the mistress
of this hapless heart.

10:35.080 --> 10:39.552
Good day, Señor.
Might you need help with directions?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.640
I am Don Quixote
of La Mancha.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.980
- Okay then.
- Do you mock me, sir?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.100
No no no no.
I'm just drunk.

10:50.803 --> 10:53.060
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Señor Don.

10:53.228 --> 10:56.140
I'm Sancho Panza.
Where are you headed?

10:56.408 --> 11:01.519
My destination lies
in the hands of destiny.

11:01.884 --> 11:05.448
My actions guided
by a higher purpose...

11:05.651 --> 11:08.933
peerless love of
Dulcinea Del Toboso.

11:10.748 --> 11:12.785
Is she easy on the eyes?

11:14.562 --> 11:17.942
Her face is as pale as
the summer moon.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.740
Her neck, long, as a swan.

11:21.760 --> 11:26.200
Its waist, slender
as a blade of grass.

11:26.621 --> 11:27.934
Slender?

11:29.598 --> 11:31.489
That's fine for some people.

11:31.707 --> 11:36.154
Me!
I like my women bigger.

11:36.623 --> 11:37.535
You know?

11:37.647 --> 11:39.365
My wife is so big.

11:39.389 --> 11:41.764
Sometimes I wish
I had a third hand.

11:41.840 --> 11:45.826
I tell you, there is no maiden
fairer than Dulcinea de Toboso.

11:45.934 --> 11:50.287
- Do you deny her beauty?
- No no no, of course not, Señor.

11:50.694 --> 11:52.700
What I am simply saying is....

11:53.168 --> 11:57.324
one man's passion
is another man's poison.

11:57.590 --> 11:58.754
Poison?

11:58.949 --> 12:01.762
I cannot let this
insult pass unpunished.

12:02.097 --> 12:05.131
Prepare yourself!
Three handed scoundrel.

12:05.156 --> 12:07.968
- What?
- Charge, Rocinante!

12:07.992 --> 12:10.265
Please, I'm a peaceful man.

12:20.050 --> 12:21.928
Señor, are you okay?

12:22.952 --> 12:26.905
Oh! Señor Quixano!
I know that face anywhere.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.530
We're from the same village.

12:30.715 --> 12:33.199
I'm Don Quixote
of La Mancha.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.634
Some demon has
bewitched my horse.

12:42.835 --> 12:48.158
Very well, let's uh... wheel you
back to the big house, shall we?

13:01.560 --> 13:05.270
- Oh, no. Señor you okay?
- Quite all right!

13:08.733 --> 13:10.874
We're almost home, Señor.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.340
Your family
will be grateful

13:16.360 --> 13:19.737
that Sancho Panza
got you home safely.

13:20.487 --> 13:23.141
Do you enjoy covered
in manure, Sancho?

13:25.042 --> 13:28.429
It's not so bad.
It gets me out of the house.

13:29.255 --> 13:32.427
If I were home, my Teresa
will have me doing chores anyway.

13:33.107 --> 13:38.182
Do you never dream of glorious
adventures in far away lands?

13:38.538 --> 13:42.240
Treasures more precious
than any dragon horde?

13:42.953 --> 13:46.742
They say impossible dreams
bring certain sorrow.

13:47.702 --> 13:51.901
And yet dreams fulfilled,
lead to certain joy.

13:52.960 --> 13:57.113
Me thinks I have need of a squire.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.790
- A squire.
- Yeah.

13:59.814 --> 14:00.999
What's a squire?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.846
To be my companion on glorious
and chivalrous adventures.

14:07.525 --> 14:11.095
- Like a slave?
- No, Sancho.

14:11.120 --> 14:16.645
No. A squire is to be priced
above any slave or servant...

14:17.060 --> 14:20.640
for he worth more than
twenty ordinary men.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.835
Well, okay.
I must say, Señor,

14:25.976 --> 14:30.397
You are a much better load than
any pile of manure I've ever carted.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.855
What ever happened?

14:44.370 --> 14:48.120
ALS, the good knight fell
from his horse, this morning.

14:48.628 --> 14:51.608
And I carried him a
very long... long way.

14:52.144 --> 14:54.693
Are you hurt Uncle?

14:55.143 --> 14:57.771
- Miguel, help me.
- Yes. Of course.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.475
The odour is of a... fine manure.

15:04.850 --> 15:08.509
And if I come home without it,
my wife would be very very angry.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.494
- Can you walk?
- Oh I'm all right.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.559
Sancho Panza is
at your service.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.180
I live in a little stone house,

15:19.200 --> 15:23.116
with all the laundry and
all the kids and a donkey.

15:23.585 --> 15:27.100
Oh yes, and my wife Teresa.
If you need anything cleaned,

15:27.120 --> 15:28.911
She is the best
laundress in the province.

15:28.935 --> 15:31.716
We have no need of laundering.
Thank you.

15:32.263 --> 15:35.921
Normally I wouldn't ask
anything to help Señor Quixano

15:36.010 --> 15:38.953
but you see there is
the matter of the manure.

15:39.364 --> 15:41.569
I have nothing to show
for my long journey.

15:42.390 --> 15:45.820
They say virtue is
its own reward,

15:46.022 --> 15:49.390
but I like to say,
a little money is also good.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.071
I will pay him.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.134
No!... No.

15:55.158 --> 15:58.712
 I... I insist. For you,
it's the least I can do.

15:59.788 --> 16:01.008
Thank you, Miguel.

16:01.103 --> 16:03.832
- And thank you too, Sancho Panza.
- You are welcome.

16:03.857 --> 16:06.357
But please, don't breach
a word of this to anyone.

16:06.357 --> 16:09.293
No no no no.
A full pocket is a closed mouth.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.260
If the Señor needs anything,
he needs his saddle fixed,

16:14.280 --> 16:17.524
or his Armour polished
or his fine mustache waxed,

16:17.732 --> 16:19.798
don't hesitate to call for me.
I will...

16:19.823 --> 16:23.313
My uncle won't be going on
any more adventures for a while.

16:25.028 --> 16:29.153
Sancho Panza,
I am in your debt.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.042
It's me!

17:00.067 --> 17:01.594
Oh Sancho!

17:03.147 --> 17:04.589
Where is the pig manure?

17:05.042 --> 17:06.752
Oh, it's a long story.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.819
You have been gone all day.

17:09.839 --> 17:13.038
Yes, but... I have this.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.339
Did you steal it?

17:17.359 --> 17:21.073
No, I didn't steal it.
I got it from Señor Quixano.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.020
The man from the big house?

17:23.040 --> 17:26.651
Yes, and he was talking about maybe
giving me more work. We could be rich.

17:26.791 --> 17:29.052
Could have other
people do our laundry...

17:29.185 --> 17:32.079
so you and I could have
more time to... kissy, kissy.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.239
You stink!
Go take a tub.

17:35.293 --> 17:39.326
Yes, I do stink.
I am a stinky monster.

17:39.615 --> 17:42.398
I'm going to smash you to jelly.

17:45.781 --> 17:48.060
- Come here! I eat this one.
- No! Get down!

17:48.080 --> 17:49.609
I eat this one too.

18:00.802 --> 18:02.365
What are you doing?

18:02.498 --> 18:05.512
- We're going to burn them.
- Well that's hardly necessary.

18:05.537 --> 18:08.209
What if he'd been seriously hurt?
Or killed?

18:08.482 --> 18:11.357
- I'd blame you for this.
- Me?  That's ridiculous.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.779
Who brought him all of these?

18:12.890 --> 18:16.220
Who came here night after night
to cry all about tales of chivalry?

18:16.240 --> 18:20.060
If you are so convinced that these
books are the root of his madness,

18:20.080 --> 18:23.453
- I will exorcise them.
- Please, Father. No time for that.

18:23.765 --> 18:25.580
We must finish
before he wakes up.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.991
Young man, as a student
you must object to this.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.266
It is a little extreme.

18:33.657 --> 18:38.665
But under the circumstances...
Antonia is right.

18:39.464 --> 18:41.262
Burn them all!

18:55.665 --> 18:56.940
No!

18:57.080 --> 18:58.480
No!

19:00.789 --> 19:02.428
My books!

19:05.000 --> 19:08.025
- My precious books!
- Please don't go!

19:08.050 --> 19:11.705
- I will correct this!
- Uncle!

19:12.544 --> 19:13.743
I can explain.

19:13.768 --> 19:17.180
There's no need to explain. It couldn't
be more obvious what has happened.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.060
- I'm sorry, but I have...
- That smell. I would know it anywhere.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.559
A dragon. A dragon
has devoured my books.

19:24.613 --> 19:28.262
His foul fire breathing stench
still lingers in the air.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.900
A dragon?

19:29.920 --> 19:34.740
Of course. El Sabio Freston
sent it to destroy my treasures.

19:34.760 --> 19:39.031
So you believe this is the work
of the infamous sorcerer Freston?

19:39.063 --> 19:40.500
Who else could it be?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.660
My mission is clear.

19:42.963 --> 19:47.252
To seek out this fiendish wizard
and his malodorous monster,

19:47.385 --> 19:51.565
to vanquish them before they
wreak more devastation on the world.

19:57.504 --> 19:59.795
My histories have perished.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.350
I must fulfill my quest,

20:04.007 --> 20:06.546
so that more
histories may be written

20:06.755 --> 20:09.525
on the glorious
adventures of Don Quixote.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.439
But you can't leave tonight.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.333
There are... There are...

20:15.502 --> 20:17.971
There are dragons
lurking out there.

20:18.386 --> 20:22.029
My child.
I do not fear dragons.

20:22.451 --> 20:24.966
Of course not. But...

20:25.115 --> 20:27.719
But a wise knight
would leave on daylight.

20:32.583 --> 20:36.478
Quite so.
I shall depart on the morrow.

20:51.269 --> 20:55.042
Good night Uncle.
We'll discuss it in the morning, okay?

21:05.265 --> 21:09.929
Yes! Yes! Oh! Yes! Yes!
Si, Sancho. Yes!

21:11.484 --> 21:13.020
We're going to be rich.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.500
You're going to be a grand lady.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.249
Oh yes, some lady.

21:17.274 --> 21:20.108
Tomorrow I have
thirteen orders to wash.

21:21.944 --> 21:23.940
What is, what, what is it?
What is it?

21:24.178 --> 21:25.421
My deep love for you.

21:25.579 --> 21:27.687
No! No! There's someone out there.

21:27.815 --> 21:29.693
- Sancho Panza!
- Oh god!

21:31.555 --> 21:33.287
- It's him!
- Him.. who?

21:33.312 --> 21:36.318
Señor Quixano. See!
Told you.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.673
Sancho Panza!

21:38.760 --> 21:41.931
- Why is he dressed like that?
- He thinks he's a knight.

21:42.980 --> 21:45.620
- So he's mad?
- Maybe.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.472
Sancho Panza!

21:52.066 --> 21:54.167
What is it, Señor?
Are you well?

21:54.222 --> 21:58.193
I have come here
to hire you as my squire.

21:59.132 --> 22:00.566
What is it?

22:00.979 --> 22:03.719
Make haste!
We leave at once.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.390
One second.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.816
He wants me to be his squire.

22:10.855 --> 22:12.785
What does a squire do?

22:12.809 --> 22:15.135
I don't know.
But he wants me to leave now.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.129
Now?  Where to?

22:18.217 --> 22:20.900
- He hasn't said.
- How much is he going to pay you?

22:21.396 --> 22:22.796
One second.

22:25.818 --> 22:29.037
Señor, my wife wants to know
how much will you be paying me.

22:29.200 --> 22:33.491
Tell your wife, a knight
does not pay a squire wages.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.952
Tell him that only
a fool would follow

22:35.993 --> 22:37.991
a madman for no pay.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.007
Do you want to shovel
manure the rest of your life?

22:43.296 --> 22:47.195
Or journey with me and
gain riches far beyond coinage.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.546
Such as?

22:48.799 --> 22:51.805
It was the custom of knights
errant to make their squires

22:51.830 --> 22:55.020
governors of islands and
kingdoms they've conquered.

22:55.260 --> 22:59.012
I intend to resume
that pleasing custom.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.278
One second.

23:02.559 --> 23:04.051
Yeah, yeah, you know.
I heard.

23:04.109 --> 23:06.940
What are you going
to do with an island?

23:06.965 --> 23:09.123
Well, we can leave all this behind.

23:10.513 --> 23:13.498
People need to be
content in their own station.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.220
We are poor.
We are always going to be poor.

23:18.466 --> 23:20.901
I am happy being poor.

23:21.672 --> 23:25.220
I've heard said that
"If you do not take advantage of luck

23:25.320 --> 23:29.096
when if comes by. You have no right
to complain when it passes you".

23:29.294 --> 23:31.331
Sancho Panza!

23:32.423 --> 23:37.259
I'm sorry, Señor!
You will have to find someone else.

23:45.471 --> 23:46.528
Sancho!

23:56.600 --> 24:00.389
<i>You want to shovel
manure the rest of your life?</i>

24:11.634 --> 24:13.193
Señor Quixano!

24:17.432 --> 24:18.613
Don Quixote.

24:21.018 --> 24:22.121
Sancho.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.723
I've changed my mind, Señor.
I want to join you on your quest.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.457
Are you ready
for a grand adventure?

24:29.824 --> 24:32.703
- Si, Señor.
- Follow me, Sancho Panza.

24:34.553 --> 24:35.944
Where are we going, Señor?

24:36.240 --> 24:39.553
We are in search of a
sorcerer and his dragon.

24:39.960 --> 24:43.192
Wherever they dwell,
that is our destination.

24:46.040 --> 24:50.251
- What exactly does a squire do?
- Whatever his knight commands.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.847
Your first task is to
find me a new helmet.

24:53.872 --> 24:57.124
Preferably one forged
from pure gold.

24:58.437 --> 25:00.601
I will do my best, Señor Knight.

25:01.200 --> 25:06.100
But you should know, truth
be told, I'm not a brave man.

25:06.587 --> 25:08.048
Fear not, Sancho.

25:08.280 --> 25:12.712
Should we encounter another knight,
it is against the code of chivalry

25:12.737 --> 25:15.540
for my squire to
engage in combat.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.794
Good.

25:17.818 --> 25:21.099
Unless you're fighting
common folk such as yourself.

25:21.505 --> 25:24.935
Then you must fight to
protect your knight's honor

25:25.064 --> 25:27.324
with every sinew in your body.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.793
All the bloodletting, limb losing

25:30.898 --> 25:34.089
and skull crushing
blows of glorious battle,

25:34.920 --> 25:37.879
swords, buried in each other's flesh.

25:41.088 --> 25:43.555
You are braver than,
you know, Sancho.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.288
Sancho, do you hear something?

25:52.388 --> 25:55.699
It sounds like a poor
soul in need of assistance.

25:57.032 --> 25:59.964
- I hope someone helps them.
- Come! Brave squire.

26:04.934 --> 26:07.483
No no no. No! Please not again.

26:09.632 --> 26:10.940
That's for my lost sheep.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.827
Lay your weapon down!

26:16.637 --> 26:19.223
Is this how you do
battle, craven knight?

26:19.372 --> 26:21.372
With defenseless children?

26:21.673 --> 26:25.622
Mount your horse and take up
your lance before I run you through.

26:26.790 --> 26:28.331
This is my servant.

26:29.292 --> 26:32.340
His carelessness has cost
me three sheep this week.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.180
Is that so, young man?

26:34.550 --> 26:37.628
- They ran away.
- They ran away. I heard that before.

26:37.714 --> 26:41.260
No! You're supposed to watch them.
I found him sleeping.

26:41.675 --> 26:42.820
He never pays me.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.300
That... He... He's a liar.

26:45.398 --> 26:49.333
Pay him now. Or I will run
you through with my blade.

26:49.811 --> 26:53.136
- What are your wages?
- Seven reales a month.

26:53.161 --> 26:55.365
No! No, that's not... no!

26:55.390 --> 26:57.119
Pay him now villain.

26:57.885 --> 27:00.447
Sancho!
Untie the boy.

27:00.892 --> 27:05.340
Okay, this is... this is...
this is just about right.

27:05.775 --> 27:07.420
However there is one problem.

27:07.652 --> 27:09.900
I don't have money
to pay him right now.

27:09.988 --> 27:12.660
If you lower your weapon,
look I promise

27:12.680 --> 27:14.816
I promise to pay him his dues.

27:15.370 --> 27:19.674
Know that I am Don Quixote of
La Mancha. Righter of wrongs.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.599
If I discover you have
not fulfill your promise,

27:23.794 --> 27:25.872
I will hunt you
down and punish you.

27:26.388 --> 27:29.890
Even if you try to conceal
yourself... like a lizard.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.148
Thank you, Señor.
Thank you.

27:35.542 --> 27:37.340
Have a wonderful day.

27:42.023 --> 27:45.460
You sure put the fear of God
into that scoundrel, Don Quixote.

27:45.773 --> 27:48.380
All villains will quake
before us, Sancho.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.281
Innocents will be saved.

28:03.967 --> 28:08.904
Do my eyes deceive me, or
is that the very thing we seek?

28:10.498 --> 28:13.060
The golden helmet of Mambrino.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.086
There is something on his head.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.540
That helmet was intended for
only the most worthy knight.

28:20.976 --> 28:23.871
This man is surely an imposter.

28:26.159 --> 28:29.605
Yield that helmet, thieving rogue!

28:29.705 --> 28:30.589
What?

28:51.520 --> 28:56.112
- So... old barber's basin. Junk it!
- No no no. Sancho!

28:58.157 --> 28:59.910
Let me see that.

29:00.680 --> 29:06.199
No sorcery could prevent me from
recognizing this for what it truly is.

29:09.901 --> 29:12.575
The golden helmet of Mambrino.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.587
It is not the most complimentary of hats

29:15.875 --> 29:18.873
and uh... it is brass.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.382
That's because you
do not look close enough.

29:23.520 --> 29:27.036
You must learn to
you look closer, Sancho.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.340
<i>Sarah. Answer me!</i>

29:59.519 --> 30:04.033
<i>How much longer am I going
to have to be in this stuffy box?</i>

30:04.600 --> 30:07.046
<i>Madam! We will get there
when we get there.</i>

30:07.071 --> 30:08.797
I am trapped!

30:08.891 --> 30:12.235
Behold, Sancho.
A lady in need.

30:12.260 --> 30:15.183
<i>How much more, sire?</i>

30:15.428 --> 30:17.451
<i>- Madam!
- I have had it.</i>

30:17.476 --> 30:22.460
Unnatural devils!
Release this kidnapped lady at once!

30:22.558 --> 30:24.277
Stand aside!

30:25.957 --> 30:30.110
I said... stand... aside!

30:31.791 --> 30:34.334
<i>Can you hear me out there?</i>

30:34.840 --> 30:35.956
Friar!

30:44.764 --> 30:46.618
Charge!

30:56.795 --> 30:58.253
Brace yourself, my lady.

30:58.943 --> 31:00.821
What's going on out there?

31:07.040 --> 31:08.966
Is that a barber's basin?

31:08.991 --> 31:14.271
Nay nay. This is the
golden helmet of Mambrino.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.947
Prepare to die.

31:31.409 --> 31:33.446
Come back here you weasel!

31:41.357 --> 31:43.553
What the devil is going on here?

31:44.715 --> 31:46.195
Contessa!

31:48.800 --> 31:52.189
Say the word and I will
teach these ruffians the true

31:52.214 --> 31:54.780
consequences of abusing a lady.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.077
Even if it costs me my life.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.384
Rise, sir.

32:17.007 --> 32:19.735
I was not in any danger.

32:20.432 --> 32:24.393
My servants and the
friar were conducting me

32:24.418 --> 32:26.977
to the sacred shrine at El Rocio.

32:27.810 --> 32:31.851
Do I understand that it is your wish
that I pardon these men, my lady?

32:32.436 --> 32:33.631
Well...

32:37.123 --> 32:38.268
It is.

32:38.427 --> 32:40.896
Then it is my duty to obey.

32:42.851 --> 32:44.968
And they say chivalry is dead.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.809
Farewell, my lady.

32:50.209 --> 32:51.350
Sancho!

32:55.096 --> 32:58.055
- Hey! That's my purse.
- Friar!

32:58.720 --> 33:00.989
Greed does not become you.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.915
We shall sleep here for the night.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.411
We can stay at an inn.
We have money.

33:20.710 --> 33:25.954
We shall sleep beneath the canopy
of stars as befit tonight's errant.

33:26.955 --> 33:28.394
But I'm not a knight.

33:33.601 --> 33:38.960
- Ahh there. That should be fine.
- I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

33:40.359 --> 33:43.074
What I would do for one
of my Teresa's pies?

33:43.683 --> 33:48.143
You must learn, Sancho, not to concern
yourself with common bodily needs.

33:48.758 --> 33:50.782
Ours is a higher calling.

33:50.843 --> 33:55.872
We do not need food,
sleep or drink like other men.

33:56.840 --> 34:00.629
Well, it's the stomach
that carry the feet, they say.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.420
And... sleep is a cure for misery.

34:04.794 --> 34:06.739
Say what you will, good squire.

34:07.307 --> 34:10.873
But I can tell, yours is the
heart of an adventurer.

34:12.192 --> 34:16.790
To breathe the open air,
to laugh in the face of death.

34:17.793 --> 34:22.300
- That is what you desire.
- But those seeking adventure,

34:22.648 --> 34:24.608
not always find
happiness, Señor.

34:25.465 --> 34:28.516
A knight errant does not
concern himself with happiness.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.635
Only the honor of accomplishment.

34:32.514 --> 34:35.320
To suckle the weak,
to punish the guilty.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.616
These are the goals I seek.

34:38.850 --> 34:42.186
I take pride in my wounds
and I feel no pain,

34:42.838 --> 34:46.025
when I think of the lady
whose name they were earned.

34:46.797 --> 34:49.139
A knight errant,
without a lady love

34:49.165 --> 34:51.867
is a tree without leaves or fruits.

34:53.103 --> 34:54.837
A body without a soul.

35:12.273 --> 35:14.549
How about we go right, master?

35:15.423 --> 35:18.255
A knight errant does
not veer from his course...

35:18.978 --> 35:20.713
no matter the danger.

35:21.341 --> 35:23.927
I know that,
but in this case...

35:23.981 --> 35:24.943
Sancho!

35:25.864 --> 35:29.021
Do I see men
enslaved against their will?

35:30.302 --> 35:31.564
Probably for a good reason.

35:31.669 --> 35:33.591
But we cannot ignore their plight.

35:33.616 --> 35:36.556
I really think it would be
best if we go right now.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.801
Think with your heart, Sancho.

35:38.957 --> 35:41.515
Not your spleen.
Rocinante!

35:51.264 --> 35:53.975
By what right do you
enslave these souls?

35:54.170 --> 35:55.598
By orders of the king.

35:56.180 --> 35:58.853
They're convicted criminals
on their way to the galleys.

35:59.063 --> 36:01.594
By order of the king.
Let's go.

36:01.816 --> 36:03.766
We are innocent, my lord.

36:05.895 --> 36:08.128
It was self-defense, every time.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.615
I'm but a poor victim
in these harsh times,

36:12.746 --> 36:15.260
when examples are
made of the unfortunate.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.116
Hold your tongue, Pasamonte.

36:17.194 --> 36:20.040
Desist! I want to hear him out.

36:21.317 --> 36:23.037
We are generous souls.

36:23.840 --> 36:28.171
José, never took a real he
didn't pass on to the innkeeper.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.202
And Enrique, these ladies give pleasure

36:32.227 --> 36:34.980
to every man
within a hundred miles.

36:35.435 --> 36:37.923
You seem like an educated fella.

36:37.948 --> 36:42.517
Educated indeed. But
persecuted for my good wit.

36:44.592 --> 36:48.660
Release these men and
I will let you go in peace.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.980
Enough! Be gone, fool.

36:52.383 --> 36:54.220
You impede the king's order.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.060
Please, Señor! They'll report
us to the holy brotherhood.

36:57.080 --> 37:03.615
By this lance and the might
of this arm, I compel you:

37:03.640 --> 37:05.614
To comply!

37:17.720 --> 37:20.322
Rocinante!

37:25.450 --> 37:26.630
Stand still!

37:30.200 --> 37:31.714
That wasn't my idea...

37:36.535 --> 37:37.915
Take them!

38:00.557 --> 38:01.673
Enrique!

38:08.882 --> 38:10.475
Give me that ass.

38:11.631 --> 38:13.074
Please don't take my ass.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.740
- Give me your money!
- I cannot!

38:16.760 --> 38:19.246
- My wife will kill me!
- I'll kill you myself!

38:19.655 --> 38:21.115
Alright! Okay!

38:22.649 --> 38:24.971
Squeal piggie! Squeal!

38:28.240 --> 38:29.882
So long, Amigo!

38:52.371 --> 38:56.080
They took my ass.
They stole my silver.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.960
And they drank my wine.
You don't drink a man's wine.

39:02.720 --> 39:06.119
And now the Brotherhood is after us.
Señor, I warned you.

39:06.760 --> 39:11.789
Do not fret, Sancho.
A knight errant is above the law.

39:13.006 --> 39:15.300
We defied the King's order, Señor.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.114
If they find us they'll kill us.

39:19.191 --> 39:23.236
You must lower your voice.
You do not want to wake him.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.740
Who?

39:27.391 --> 39:28.871
The giant.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.394
There's no giant!

40:27.611 --> 40:29.671
Let me down!

40:35.920 --> 40:37.798
Let go of my lance!

40:40.770 --> 40:43.583
I will hold on forever!

40:43.841 --> 40:47.263
Wait till you feel
the taste of my lance!

40:47.926 --> 40:50.157
You do not frighten me!

40:50.717 --> 40:53.596
I am not afraid of you, Freston!

40:55.360 --> 40:56.360
Señor!

40:57.080 --> 40:58.080
Señor!

41:06.900 --> 41:08.414
It's a windmill.

41:08.930 --> 41:10.605
A windmill?

41:11.480 --> 41:13.995
A moment ago it was a giant.

41:14.677 --> 41:17.866
This must be the
work of El Sabio Freston.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.325
The what?

41:19.533 --> 41:22.848
The sorcerer. He transformed it.

41:23.865 --> 41:25.682
He must be nearby.

41:25.893 --> 41:27.850
Fear not, Sancho.

41:29.798 --> 41:32.051
The evil arts of Freston

41:32.292 --> 41:35.667
will avail him little against
the power of my lance.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.793
But you don't have a lance.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.786
Señor, please! Come down.

41:44.851 --> 41:48.020
I know, Sancho.
What is a knight without a lance?

41:48.180 --> 41:49.848
What's a squire without his donkey?

41:52.819 --> 41:55.876
Oh my God!
Why are you always falling?

41:56.211 --> 41:57.725
Señor!
Are you  hurt?

41:59.360 --> 42:01.107
Not really Sancho.

42:01.920 --> 42:06.420
But... let us camp here for the night.

42:06.440 --> 42:11.746
No blanket, no pillow, no
food, no wine, no coin.

42:12.332 --> 42:15.691
My ass hurts like hell.
The Brotherhood's after us.

42:15.816 --> 42:19.550
- And I'm not even being paid.
- Oh be thankful, Sancho.

42:20.578 --> 42:24.362
You finally unburden yourself
of the petty trappings of

42:24.387 --> 42:26.900
your former soulless existence.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.873
I liked my soulless existence.

42:30.717 --> 42:35.380
Your journey into a glorious
new life is just beginning.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.628
That's what I'm afraid of.

42:36.815 --> 42:40.120
It's not that person pay you enough
to eat. It isn't what a hill of beans.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.503
I am thine forever.

42:59.802 --> 43:04.461
If I should die, no, perish,

43:05.102 --> 43:09.632
I bequeath you my undying love.

43:10.080 --> 43:13.039
Are you talking to me, Señor?
- Yes, Sancho. Of course.

43:14.200 --> 43:19.358
You must memorize these words,
insufficient though they may be

43:19.383 --> 43:23.246
to capture the depth
of my admiration.

43:23.762 --> 43:27.900
Your beauty shimmers like the sun.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.784
"Your beauty shimmers like the sun. "

43:29.809 --> 43:34.975
No. Wait! Shimmers
like sunlight on a lake.

43:35.242 --> 43:36.540
"Like sunlight on a lake".

43:36.560 --> 43:38.300
No, Sancho. Wait.

43:38.320 --> 43:41.580
- You want to figure it out?
- Yes, listen, Sancho. Please.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.866
Concentrate.

43:43.304 --> 43:45.353
Your beauty shimmers...

43:45.542 --> 43:51.620
like sunlight on the glistening
ripples on the placid waters of a lake.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.180
You expect me to
remember all of this?

43:54.200 --> 43:58.273
Of course. Yes, Sancho.
You must recite this to Dulcinea.

43:58.797 --> 44:01.281
We must warn her of Freston.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.553
As you approach her,
get down on one knee.

44:06.928 --> 44:11.220
Extend your hand...
and kiss it softly.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.106
Okay. I get it.

44:13.293 --> 44:14.653
I get it fully. Thank you.

44:14.895 --> 44:16.677
Where can I find this lady?

44:17.134 --> 44:19.117
She lives in Castle Toboso.

44:19.477 --> 44:21.918
Oh oh yes, Toboso.

44:22.059 --> 44:24.700
- Where they serve food and drink?
-  Yeah?

44:25.091 --> 44:26.458
And wenches.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.220
Oh I like that place. Yes.

44:29.782 --> 44:31.244
Oh, I'll go. Yeah.

44:31.343 --> 44:36.220
Commend this to her as
proof of my boundless love.

44:36.363 --> 44:41.980
We must make haste, good squire.
The sorcerer and his dragon are near.

44:42.226 --> 44:44.476
It will be difficult to make haste.

44:44.680 --> 44:48.087
It is a very long way and
I am without my mount.

44:48.337 --> 44:53.209
Also my hind quarters
is very sore from whipping and

44:53.568 --> 44:55.340
just general running.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.100
Take my steed, good squire.

44:58.297 --> 45:00.667
- What?...
- I... I must remain vigilant

45:00.721 --> 45:03.780
in fashioning my new lance.

45:03.947 --> 45:05.460
Worry not, Señor.

45:05.480 --> 45:08.141
Sancho Panza is at your service.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.513
What were those words again?

45:16.600 --> 45:17.954
That's his horse.

45:20.350 --> 45:21.701
Oh Antonia, Antonia.

45:21.975 --> 45:24.240
A woman of your worth
shouldn't go in there.

45:32.809 --> 45:34.790
Mmm. I'm sure you would like it.

45:44.506 --> 45:46.384
Who is with the horse outside?

45:48.040 --> 45:51.590
Oh, there. That's the man
who brought your uncle home.

45:58.116 --> 46:01.054
You have my uncle's horse.
Where is he?

46:01.311 --> 46:04.541
- He's outside.
- Not the horse. My uncle.

46:04.853 --> 46:06.170
What have you done with him?

46:06.195 --> 46:07.980
Nothing, Señorita.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.220
He sent me here with his horse
to deliver a message.

46:13.240 --> 46:15.197
To someone called...

46:16.748 --> 46:17.840
Dulcinea.

46:17.865 --> 46:19.511
That's it. That's right.

46:19.816 --> 46:22.871
I'm here to deliver a
message to Dulcinea.

46:23.868 --> 46:27.504
- I have no idea who it is.
- Oh, for heaven's sake. Where is he?

46:27.715 --> 46:29.886
- Who?
- We've been searching everywhere.

46:30.011 --> 46:33.460
- What's going on over there?
- We were just leaving.

46:34.068 --> 46:34.848
Come on.

46:34.873 --> 46:36.563
- No!
- Now!

46:36.665 --> 46:39.780
Or I'll inform the Holy Brotherhood
you stole our horse.

46:40.026 --> 46:43.999
Fine. I will go.
But under protest.

46:47.098 --> 46:49.887
Okay. I'm taking my wine.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.110
Hold it!
Who's going to pay for this?

46:56.490 --> 46:57.765
Five reales.

46:58.757 --> 47:01.777
You left him out there
alone... with no horse?

47:02.074 --> 47:03.611
I did as he told me.

47:04.400 --> 47:07.588
- Is he alright?
- His body is fine...

47:08.100 --> 47:09.295
but his mind...

47:10.188 --> 47:11.868
His mind is another matter.

47:12.072 --> 47:15.340
Lead us to him right now.
Once I talk to him, he'll see reason.

47:15.577 --> 47:16.753
Reason?

47:17.777 --> 47:19.916
That... I do not think so.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.780
You have to be much more
cleverer than that, Señorita.

47:23.921 --> 47:27.919
I can lead you to him.
Then I'm through.

47:28.917 --> 47:31.678
Excuse me.
That message is for me.

47:33.493 --> 47:34.460
What?

47:34.795 --> 47:36.790
You? You're Lady Dulcinea?

47:37.320 --> 47:38.879
That is what he called me.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.150
Are you sure?

47:41.416 --> 47:42.839
Do you know Señor Quixano?

47:42.995 --> 47:45.315
It's that his name?
The Knight?

47:46.551 --> 47:49.430
Please.
What is his message?

47:49.760 --> 47:54.277
His message is:
You are like ripples.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.260
What?

47:56.544 --> 48:00.070
Like you know...
Like the ripples on a lake.

48:00.760 --> 48:05.766
He said your face is like a lake.
You're lake face.

48:08.210 --> 48:11.420
Sorcerers!
Sorcerers will be there.

48:11.636 --> 48:13.716
Wow, I almost forgot that part.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.073
And... dragons.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.540
Oh boy.

48:18.638 --> 48:21.883
Oh! And... he gave me this.

48:22.242 --> 48:24.457
As proof of his undying love.

48:24.637 --> 48:26.236
Is that my uncle's blood?

48:26.290 --> 48:29.279
- Yes, but it was only a scratch.
- We have to leave at once.

48:29.523 --> 48:32.561
Undying love.
He really said that?

48:33.156 --> 48:37.926
Yes. But he also said
a lot of crazy things.

48:38.082 --> 48:38.807
- Like what?
-

48:38.831 --> 48:40.442
Like waking up in the middle
of the night and say:

48:40.467 --> 48:44.482
Her lady!
I will suffer any pain.

48:44.507 --> 48:46.237
I will face any peril.

48:49.659 --> 48:51.725
Do you really want him back home?

48:52.454 --> 48:55.701
And there's one person
who can help you.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.594
Don Quixote!

49:08.030 --> 49:09.835
Sancho.
Hello, my friend.

49:10.038 --> 49:12.900
Did you deliver my
message to Dulcinea?

49:12.920 --> 49:14.340
Yes I did.

49:14.782 --> 49:18.195
Is she not of unparalleled beauty?

49:19.200 --> 49:20.620
What?

49:21.040 --> 49:24.030
Unparalleled beauty. Sancho!

49:24.080 --> 49:26.500
Oh yes, I think one would say that.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.500
- Yes.
- It's possible to say that about her.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.615
- But it ain't. She's here. Look!
- Where?

49:37.468 --> 49:39.197
I cannot do this.

49:40.163 --> 49:42.220
I'm not comfortable telling lies.

49:42.240 --> 49:46.280
They're not lying.
More like an idea.

49:47.006 --> 49:48.660
It's for his safety.

49:49.084 --> 49:50.756
But I'm not a princess.

49:51.271 --> 49:52.633
She thinks you are.

50:08.120 --> 50:11.700
I'm blinded by your
beauty, dearest lady.

50:12.026 --> 50:14.801
In all this world there's not maiden

50:14.973 --> 50:18.799
that's radiant as
Princess Dulcinea of Toboso.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.834
Forgive me.

50:27.153 --> 50:28.442
Brave Knight.

50:29.498 --> 50:31.255
Thank goodness, we have found you.

50:31.409 --> 50:33.316
Are you in some distress?

50:33.340 --> 50:36.109
Pray, tell me.
I live to serve you.

50:36.311 --> 50:37.381
Umm...

50:39.036 --> 50:40.762
My kingdom has been invaded.

50:41.801 --> 50:42.913
By whom?

50:43.210 --> 50:44.394
Well ah...

50:46.386 --> 50:48.347
By a sorcerer.

50:49.364 --> 50:51.275
She said he rode in on a dragon.

50:52.096 --> 50:55.062
Freston! The very man I seek.

50:55.400 --> 50:58.340
You knew him then?
Do you think you can help?

50:58.562 --> 51:02.858
If there is any knight alive
who can vanquish this fiend,

51:02.920 --> 51:04.820
it is Don Quixote of La Mancha.

51:05.042 --> 51:08.249
What great fortune for
my suffering kingdom, sire.

51:08.954 --> 51:12.020
But... do you have
experience for dragons?

51:12.040 --> 51:15.335
There is nothing I do
not know about dragons.

51:15.599 --> 51:17.763
I am a dragon master.

51:18.567 --> 51:19.989
I must leave at once.

51:20.545 --> 51:21.335
Oh!

51:21.760 --> 51:22.710
Stop it.

51:24.139 --> 51:25.189
Señor!

51:26.057 --> 51:28.447
We must stay together
and protect the princess.

51:28.834 --> 51:31.550
There is nothing I
value more in this world

51:31.631 --> 51:33.521
than the safety of my Dulcinea.

51:33.915 --> 51:36.895
Which is why you must
guard her with your life,

51:37.117 --> 51:39.078
while I venture alone to Toboso.

51:39.271 --> 51:40.843
<i>Hand me my lance!</i>

51:43.084 --> 51:46.060
Señor, I beg you, stay with us.

51:46.334 --> 51:51.519
I cannot. This is a matter that
requires the utmost of urgency.

51:57.633 --> 51:59.780
The plan was to
get him back with us.

51:59.893 --> 52:02.150
Well, the first part of the plan
worked great, I thought.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.027
Come on, we have to keep up.

52:12.559 --> 52:14.550
He's so chivalrous, isn't he?

52:16.098 --> 52:17.320
Sure. Yeah.

52:32.574 --> 52:35.540
Dio mio, it's the Holy Brotherhood.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.394
We have no need to be afraid.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.200
He will the second
they recognize his armor.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.922
I am Don Quixote
of La Mancha.

52:47.125 --> 52:49.533
I demand you to identify yourselves.

52:49.557 --> 52:51.748
We are members of
the Holy Brotherhood.

52:52.187 --> 52:55.264
Peacekeepers in the employ
of His Majesty King Philip.

52:55.297 --> 52:58.873
I do not recognize such authority.
Rocinante!

52:59.120 --> 53:01.198
Get out of the way, old man!

53:02.720 --> 53:04.104
Get away from the wagon!

53:04.206 --> 53:07.112
This man is imprisoned
against his will.

53:07.299 --> 53:09.328
I command you to release him!

53:09.484 --> 53:12.382
That must be the fool
who attacked the slave chain.

53:12.407 --> 53:13.797
I command you to dismount!

53:13.821 --> 53:16.157
Please Señor, he means no harm.

53:16.182 --> 53:17.164
Stand back, lady!

53:17.188 --> 53:19.273
Free this man at once!

53:19.421 --> 53:21.473
I have no time to spare.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.560
No!

53:29.862 --> 53:31.549
No!
He's not in his right mind.

53:31.574 --> 53:33.463
He freed the king's slaves.

53:35.158 --> 53:36.274
Unhand me!

53:37.124 --> 53:39.024
Who are you people?

53:39.560 --> 53:40.589
No.

53:41.114 --> 53:42.309
No!

53:53.854 --> 53:55.811
Where are you taking him?

53:58.330 --> 53:59.810
Dulcinea!

54:02.902 --> 54:04.311
Dulcinea!

54:05.365 --> 54:07.038
My lady!

54:09.193 --> 54:11.478
My lady!

54:12.806 --> 54:14.763
My lady!

54:15.750 --> 54:17.074
Imprisoned.

54:19.198 --> 54:20.982
Do you know who I am?

54:21.511 --> 54:22.780
I don't much care.

54:22.918 --> 54:24.757
All I know is you're a madman.

54:24.938 --> 54:27.737
This is one of Freston's evil spells.

54:27.910 --> 54:30.090
You are his minions.

54:30.141 --> 54:31.840
Hey, old man.

54:32.369 --> 54:33.864
 Give it a rest, huh.

54:37.330 --> 54:39.073
I have failed.

54:39.682 --> 54:42.987
The forces of darkness
control the world.

54:48.862 --> 54:50.398
Why didn't you do something?

54:51.530 --> 54:53.079
What could I have done?

54:54.840 --> 54:56.153
Where... where are you going?

54:56.333 --> 54:57.505
To get the priest.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.625
Take the girl
back to the inn.

55:24.524 --> 55:26.334
Papa! Papa's back!

55:28.217 --> 55:31.254
Papa's home. How are you, my little chikos?

55:31.308 --> 55:32.959
Papa's very tired.
Hold me up.

55:34.041 --> 55:35.571
Did you bring us some present?

55:35.734 --> 55:37.803
Of course I brought you presents.

55:38.636 --> 55:39.672
Close your eyes.

55:39.846 --> 55:41.313
Everybody. Close! Close!

55:44.880 --> 55:46.439
Okay, open them.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.526
- Oh what is it?
- Is it a rock?

55:49.820 --> 55:51.462
No, it's not just a rock.

55:51.858 --> 55:53.085
Then what is it?

55:53.240 --> 55:54.913
It's a dragon egg.

55:56.107 --> 55:58.020
If you listen very closely,

55:58.180 --> 56:02.000
you can hear the faint sound
of a dragon's wings beating.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.718
No? Then you would
have to listen closer.

56:09.892 --> 56:11.254
Yes!

56:11.550 --> 56:12.849
Go show your mother.

56:13.137 --> 56:15.359
Mama! Mama! Mama!

56:15.442 --> 56:17.226
I'll get you all dragon eggs.

56:19.378 --> 56:21.511
Teresa, my sweet.
I'm home.

56:21.640 --> 56:24.980
So, this is how
a governor dresses?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.839
- And where is my donkey?
- Oh.

56:27.552 --> 56:28.381
I can explain.

56:28.405 --> 56:31.259
Our livelihood depends
on with that animal.

56:31.284 --> 56:35.260
Please don't get mad.
The strangest thing happened.

56:35.635 --> 56:37.604
Dapple has more sense than you.

56:38.004 --> 56:39.613
He brought himself home.

56:41.274 --> 56:43.900
In fact, while you off getting rich,

56:43.920 --> 56:46.922
we had been doing
just fine without you.

56:48.193 --> 56:50.020
Teresa, my sweet.

56:50.040 --> 56:53.537
I just want to be home
with you, and the children.

56:54.060 --> 56:55.390
 And poor.

56:57.961 --> 56:59.547
No more adventures?

56:59.895 --> 57:01.329
No more adventures.

57:02.779 --> 57:05.287
I have some chores
for you before supper.

57:06.450 --> 57:07.833
- Perfect.
- Mm hm.

57:08.184 --> 57:11.616
And I have some chores
for you after supper.

57:11.640 --> 57:12.729
Come on!

57:17.604 --> 57:20.370
Oh, I miss you, my stallion.

57:22.131 --> 57:24.612
- Oh yes!
- Oh! I guess this is it.

57:24.996 --> 57:26.610
Oh! Oooh!

57:26.653 --> 57:28.007
<i>Sancho!</i>

57:29.560 --> 57:32.444
You are braver than
you know, Sancho.

57:32.469 --> 57:33.530
Yes... Yes my...

57:33.554 --> 57:35.096
<i>Fight for your knight's honour.</i>

57:39.945 --> 57:41.379
What is the matter?

57:42.744 --> 57:45.246
I left him to face the
Holy Brotherhood alone.

57:45.360 --> 57:48.054
Si, you had the brains to flee!

57:49.360 --> 57:52.188
Oh, Sancho.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.079
Who goes there?

58:19.972 --> 58:22.752
- State your purpose.
- Just a weary traveler...

58:22.805 --> 58:25.096
who is trying to find his
way home before dawn.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.620
Might I be able to sit by your fire?

58:27.640 --> 58:29.502
We're members of
the Holy Brotherhood.

58:30.075 --> 58:31.119
You need to leave.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.862
The Holy Brotherhood.

58:33.433 --> 58:34.886
How foolish of me.

58:35.267 --> 58:37.142
I couldn't tell in the darkness.

58:37.921 --> 58:40.632
It's an honor to meet
you, fine gentlemen.

58:40.746 --> 58:43.483
Us common folk are in your debt.

58:44.536 --> 58:47.990
The righters of wrong,
the protectors of the innocent.

58:50.567 --> 58:51.900
Would you care for some wine?

58:51.920 --> 58:55.540
Surely you can have some wine
for all your noble services?

58:55.560 --> 58:57.711
No. Leave now!

58:58.160 --> 58:59.050
Of course.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.526
There must be some edict

59:00.550 --> 59:02.823
forbidding members of the
Brotherhood from drinking wine.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.027
Forgive me.

59:05.560 --> 59:08.120
- I do not recall such an edict.
- Nor I.

59:08.360 --> 59:10.387
Remember our Lord shared his wine

59:10.412 --> 59:12.786
with his friends
at the Last Supper?

59:12.956 --> 59:16.390
Who are we to not honor the
customs of our Lord and Saviour?

59:16.489 --> 59:18.267
Come on, Thomas, relax.

59:18.417 --> 59:21.376
I could use a little.
It's been a long day.

59:22.583 --> 59:24.317
Very well, Thomas.
Here you go.

59:25.107 --> 59:26.199
- And here's one.
- It's good wine.

59:26.200 --> 59:28.139
- Enjoy, gentlemen.
- It's very good.

59:28.164 --> 59:30.942
Hey, guys.
You got any extra wine for me?

59:30.967 --> 59:32.683
**

59:35.080 --> 59:36.483
Are you feeling alright?

59:37.030 --> 59:38.171
Excuse me?

59:39.280 --> 59:42.477
- Are you feeling alright?
- It's a cold night.

59:42.502 --> 59:45.678
But I'm sure I'll feel
better with the fire.

01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:16.508
Fat boy! On the belt.
There!

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.998
Give me the keys.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.381
You! I know you.

01:01:04.502 --> 01:01:07.328
No, I don't think so.
I've never seen you, man.

01:01:07.593 --> 01:01:08.559
Yeah!

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.580
- You whipped me.
- No.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.940
You took my ass and
then you took my silver.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.548
I never took nobody's
ass in my whole life.

01:01:15.642 --> 01:01:19.160
- I saw you with my eyes.
- I have one of those faces.

01:01:22.227 --> 01:01:23.991
I don't trust you.
Get away from the gate.

01:01:24.016 --> 01:01:27.910
I'm going crazy in this cage.
And if you don't open that lock,

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:31.220
I might scream.
I might scream!

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.357
Don't scream.
Don't scream.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.471
Just be quiet, okay.

01:01:35.947 --> 01:01:37.792
Now this is how you unlock.

01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:41.626
- That's right. Be quiet.
- Sssh. Okay.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.554
- Speak quietly.
- Yah. Yah.

01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:47.078
See you, piggy!

01:01:51.414 --> 01:01:54.109
Don Quixote. Señor...
Señor, it's me Sancho.

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:57.695
Your noble squire. We have leave.
The brotherhood is here.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.884
Adios Idiotas! Vesate Culo!

01:02:02.325 --> 01:02:05.481
Hey! It's Pasamonte.
Go get the mule.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.687
- No! Forget about him.
- Señor.

01:02:09.723 --> 01:02:11.802
Get him!
Stole my horse!

01:02:13.466 --> 01:02:14.720
Señor, are you okay?

01:02:14.744 --> 01:02:16.946
Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.760
We must leave before they return.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.315
Señor. Señor.
Please, please, senor.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.431
No no. Don't die.

01:02:31.516 --> 01:02:35.838
No, no. Don't die.
Not like this. Not now, senor.

01:02:38.534 --> 01:02:43.159
Oh Sancho, you are the
most worthless creature alive.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.957
But you, Don Quixote
of La Mancha,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.954
you're the bravest
man I've ever met.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.073
You risk everything
to help those in need.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.520
I didn't always appreciate you.

01:03:04.894 --> 01:03:07.393
But you always saw the
best in me, Señor.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.495
You'll always be... the great
Don Quixote of La Mancha.

01:03:19.385 --> 01:03:21.100
Señor! Señor!

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.716
You're alive! Señor, you're alive.
I thought you were dead.

01:03:24.741 --> 01:03:26.549
No...

01:03:27.461 --> 01:03:31.637
That was quite an eloquent eulogy.

01:03:31.836 --> 01:03:34.906
You were a little hard on yourself.

01:03:35.134 --> 01:03:39.925
You... are the bravest
squire I have ever known.

01:03:57.585 --> 01:03:58.563
Look!

01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:06.568
Uncle!
Thank goodness!

01:04:07.964 --> 01:04:09.617
Rocinante!

01:04:12.407 --> 01:04:13.727
Good day Señorita.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.348
I am in your debt, good sir,
for returning my noble steed.

01:04:19.887 --> 01:04:22.862
I must ask you
to dismount at once.

01:04:22.887 --> 01:04:25.860
You're only too glad
to be rid of this nag.

01:04:26.178 --> 01:04:28.076
I assure you, my friend.

01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:37.900
Rocinante.
Noble Rocinante.

01:04:38.052 --> 01:04:40.479
This is indeed a joyous reunion.

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:42.631
Uncle, you can't go on.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.860
I have no time for idle talk.
We are on an urgent quest

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.132
- to track down the sorcerer.
- There is no sorcerer.

01:04:50.246 --> 01:04:53.626
The princess and the dragon,
we... we made all that up.

01:04:54.279 --> 01:04:56.748
- Father, stop him!
- Don Quixote!

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.998
Enough of this madness.
Come home now.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.758
I'll bring you new books, huh?

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.200
We could read the Bible together.

01:05:05.813 --> 01:05:08.136
There are some
wonderful stories in there.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.111
I'll leave the Bible to you, Father.

01:05:10.248 --> 01:05:13.882
Some men are men of letters.
I am a man of arms.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.175
I admire your faith.
In truth, I'm a little jealous.

01:05:18.452 --> 01:05:23.275
But these fantasies you believe in,
they just aren't real.

01:05:23.901 --> 01:05:26.387
And what you believe in, is?

01:05:28.582 --> 01:05:29.887
Come, Sancho!

01:05:30.222 --> 01:05:31.647
Go on then!

01:05:31.671 --> 01:05:33.722
I hope you find the giant who...

01:05:33.746 --> 01:05:36.317
cracks your crazy
head open like a nut!

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.649
- Father!
- What?

01:05:38.148 --> 01:05:39.377
I'm sorry.

01:05:40.835 --> 01:05:45.180
Señorita, don't worry.
I will look after him.

01:05:45.205 --> 01:05:47.161
You said you were through, Sancho?

01:05:48.873 --> 01:05:50.999
Are you now as mad as he is?

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.554
Yes.
Yes, I am.

01:05:56.609 --> 01:06:00.046
Remember...
fortune favors the brave.

01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:03.727
Come on boy. Come on.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.400
That's that, then huh?

01:06:14.157 --> 01:06:18.310
Antonia... Antonia!
Antonia, where are you going?

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.933
We must be ever wary.

01:06:30.162 --> 01:06:34.156
Freston is a shape shifter
and can appear in any form.

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:37.555
I fear for you, loyal squire.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.033
Fear not, great knight.

01:06:40.524 --> 01:06:42.720
I believe I finally found my calling.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.513
What is your name, sir?

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:16.386
I am the Knight of the White Moon.

01:07:16.605 --> 01:07:19.729
I seek Don Quixote of La Mancha.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.315
What do you wish of him?

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.594
I wish to challenge him in combat,

01:07:24.688 --> 01:07:26.791
in order to prove that the
Knight of the White Moon,

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:30.189
not he, is the greatest
knight to ever don Armour.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.029
I am Don Quixote of La Mancha
and I accept your challenge.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.279
No living man will ever best me.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.540
No no no. No, no, no, Señor.

01:07:47.698 --> 01:07:48.918
It's too dangerous.

01:07:48.943 --> 01:07:51.615
Have faith, Sancho.
He has met his match.

01:07:52.045 --> 01:07:54.060
But I promised Señorita
that I would look after you.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.235
Stand aside squire.
This quarrel does not concern you.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.446
But what if... what if
he is the sorcerer in disguise?

01:08:00.471 --> 01:08:03.869
Aha! Then he will
meet his just dessert.

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:07.132
I have one condition.

01:08:07.157 --> 01:08:10.542
Ah see, Sancho.
He makes conditions.

01:08:10.648 --> 01:08:12.885
He knows he's over matched.

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:17.948
Whoever is bested on this day,
must retire from knighthood forever.

01:08:18.825 --> 01:08:20.096
Forever?

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:23.143
I do not agree to that.

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:28.845
Okay, fine. For one full year
from this minute. No less.

01:08:29.486 --> 01:08:32.176
Señor, it's not too late to postpone.

01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:36.238
Act in haste, regret at leisure.
I've heard it said.

01:08:37.562 --> 01:08:40.122
I'm growing weary of delay.

01:08:41.528 --> 01:08:43.595
I accept your challenge!

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.076
A sacred oath.
One year!

01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:49.392
Agreed.

01:08:49.912 --> 01:08:54.984
Whatever happens, Sancho Panza,
know that you have served me well.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.399
Thank you, Sir.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:12.834
Don Quixote!

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:24.287
- Oh!
- Oh! No no no no!

01:09:24.443 --> 01:09:26.966
Don Quixote...
Are you all right?

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.975
Come on, senor.
You can still defeat him.

01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.340
Do you yield, sir?

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:36.432
Never! Draw your sword!

01:09:37.314 --> 01:09:38.751
- My... my sword.
- Sword?

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.156
Okay.

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.597
Don't hurt him!

01:09:59.664 --> 01:10:01.436
He's a confused old man.

01:10:08.432 --> 01:10:09.533
Miguel?

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.598
Antonia.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.220
- Antonia. Señor, are you all right?
- What were you thinking?

01:10:16.544 --> 01:10:18.263
You could have killed him.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.164
No no no. I didn't touch him.

01:10:21.925 --> 01:10:23.484
I mean what's going on?

01:10:24.885 --> 01:10:26.794
Your uncle and I made a pact.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.540
Don Quixote, you swore a solemn oath

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.178
to set aside your
Armour for a full year.

01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:55.952
You have bested me sir.

01:10:57.345 --> 01:11:03.455
Whether by foul means or fair,
the history books will decide.

01:11:05.939 --> 01:11:10.650
But Don Quixote...
is a man of his word.

01:11:21.128 --> 01:11:24.458
I remember my grandfather had
an old suit of Armour and a horse,

01:11:24.483 --> 01:11:27.250
and I just... you know.

01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:32.774
That was smart of you...
and brave.

01:11:35.579 --> 01:11:37.730
The Knight of the White Moon?

01:11:38.104 --> 01:11:42.273
I don't know... Alright...
That was... Yeah.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.154
Until such time as
I resume my calling,

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.020
A year of pastoral life could
be bearable, I believe, Sancho?

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.784
I have heard this
prophet in raising sheep.

01:12:12.831 --> 01:12:14.200
It's a fine notion.

01:12:14.225 --> 01:12:16.538
We could tend our flock by day

01:12:16.562 --> 01:12:19.550
and sleep out under
the stars at night.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.984
Or we can drink wine in
a fine shepherd's hut.

01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:27.697
Oooh, we have a life.
We'll live, my friend.

01:13:00.869 --> 01:13:04.509
- Antonia?
- Yes. Uncle?

01:13:05.436 --> 01:13:07.826
I've had the strangest dreams.

01:13:09.845 --> 01:13:17.161
I dreamt I was travelling the
countryside as a knight-errant.

01:13:19.181 --> 01:13:21.298
With a portly squire.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.162
Much like the little man
with all the children.

01:13:26.187 --> 01:13:27.580
What's his name?

01:13:28.165 --> 01:13:29.140
Sancho;

01:13:29.717 --> 01:13:31.920
Right. Sancho Panza.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.089
And as absurd as it sounds,

01:13:36.293 --> 01:13:40.238
I feel the sting of a ** in the saddle,

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.470
and the bruises of battle on my body.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.757
Isn't that strange?

01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:56.722
We have a lot to talk about.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.587
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:14:04.443 --> 01:14:05.808
- Oh!
- Oh yeah!

01:14:05.861 --> 01:14:07.460
Oh Sancho!

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.220
<i>Sancho Panza!</i>

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.313
No.

01:14:10.338 --> 01:14:12.596
Wha... what?

01:14:17.688 --> 01:14:18.899
Sancho!

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:21.826
It's Señor Quixano.

01:14:23.766 --> 01:14:26.875
You promised!
No more adventures!

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:28.373
Fine.

01:14:43.129 --> 01:14:44.300
Sancho.

01:14:47.455 --> 01:14:48.599
Si, Don Quixote.

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.583
Not anymore.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.432
Always. You will always be the
great knight-errant of La Mancha.

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:02.138
Tales of our adventures echo
through the village, Señor.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.237
Your legend will live forever.

01:15:10.722 --> 01:15:16.912
I wish we could ride out
together one more time, Sancho.

01:15:25.012 --> 01:15:29.233
That's him. Did you hear how he
escaped from the Holy Brotherhood?

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.420
I heard that he fought a giant.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.992
I heard he slew a fire-breathing
dragon with his bare hands.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.712
Dulcinea!

01:16:10.156 --> 01:16:12.096
I lied to you, Señor.

01:16:12.349 --> 01:16:16.062
I'm only the innkeeper's
daughter, not a princess.

01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:19.298
And my name is not Dulcinea.

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:23.541
It is a beautiful name.
And it suits you so well.

01:16:24.732 --> 01:16:29.224
No man has ever seen me...
the way you do, Don Quixote.

01:16:29.642 --> 01:16:31.435
I see you as you are.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.037
Farewell my lady.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.367
I will always ride in your honor.

01:16:59.843 --> 01:17:03.128
<i>So the noble Don
Quixote of La Mancha</i>

01:17:03.262 --> 01:17:06.322
<i>set out on one final adventure.</i>

01:17:06.783 --> 01:17:09.290
<i>His legend lives on.</i>
