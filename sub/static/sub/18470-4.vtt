00:12.500 --> 00:15.410
Come, Shakespeare, you're first.

00:15.460 --> 00:18.130
Going into the tube.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.450
Come on, Titus, get out!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.540
Wa-hey!

00:24.900 --> 00:28.610
- Yeah! - Over the third.
He's done it! Congratulations.

00:28.660 --> 00:32.740
Shall we go and find some
more bunnies? Come on, then.

00:34.940 --> 00:37.570
Right. Let's find you a
good spot, shall we, Dad?

00:37.620 --> 00:39.620
Yeah, over there.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.570
Look, Betty!

00:44.620 --> 00:47.810
Yes! Aren't they lovely?

00:47.860 --> 00:50.090
Wow! Look at that one.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.240
Beh-beh.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.460
He must be a very special rabbit...

00:58.300 --> 01:01.770
- .. assuming he is a he.
- Yes, this is Hercules.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.090
He's beautiful. Obviously,
the judges agree.

01:04.140 --> 01:06.210
He's been Best in Show four years running,

01:06.260 --> 01:10.210
and hopefully, this will be the fifth.

01:10.260 --> 01:13.130
Do you mind if I take a
photo of Betty with Hercules?

01:13.180 --> 01:15.690
- Sorry, I'd rather you didn't.
- Just a quick snap.

01:15.740 --> 01:17.740
I said no.

01:20.140 --> 01:23.580
Never mind. Let's go
and see the guinea pigs.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.180
Now then, let's see what
we can do with you, eh?

01:32.380 --> 01:33.860
Yeah.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.690
This year's show is sponsored
by Briar's Pet Foods.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.220
Hello.

01:46.420 --> 01:50.810
Seb! The tea tent needs more milk,
the hurdles need to be cleared away.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.090
We've lost generator
power in the trade area

01:53.140 --> 01:56.530
and Delphi is bordering on the hysterical.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.610
I've never seen her as bad.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.890
It sounds like you need a break, then.

02:02.810 --> 02:03.810
Delphi!

02:03.860 --> 02:05.570
Sorry. We were just...

02:05.620 --> 02:08.160
Don't worry, I was just leaving.

02:09.340 --> 02:12.650
There's no time for
distractions, not this week.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.090
Sorry. He's just not very good
at taking no for an answer.

02:16.140 --> 02:17.780
Evidently.

02:21.380 --> 02:24.090
Listen, have you given
this any more thought?

02:24.140 --> 02:28.410
- Not now! - These things are
always time-sensitive, Tim.

02:28.460 --> 02:34.330
- I'm just thinking about you.
- I said not now! Why are you even here?

02:34.380 --> 02:37.300
I'm need the small brush to start with.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.650
Oh! And how is the returning champion?

02:42.700 --> 02:44.490
- Hello!
- Fine.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.810
Fine, just fine? You're slipping, Timothy.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.730
You don't usually miss an
opportunity to wax lyrical

02:51.780 --> 02:54.530
about the greatest rabbit
to ever hop the earth.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.170
Come on! It's bad sportsmanship

02:56.220 --> 02:58.130
not to give us a look at the competition.

02:58.180 --> 03:02.210
You know, that's the problem
with shows like these --

03:02.260 --> 03:06.970
full of amateurs who don't know
how to mind their own business.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.010
There is currently

03:11.060 --> 03:14.460
a two-for-one offer on
pasties at the tea tent.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.680
What are YOU doing here?

04:59.300 --> 05:00.780
Hiya.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.480
Paddy! In your bed.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.690
We weren't expecting guests.

05:30.740 --> 05:34.170
Ah, well. Meet Bernie -- nursery mascot.

05:34.220 --> 05:36.490
- Doesn't explain why he's here.
- It's our turn.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.170
Our turn to...?

05:38.220 --> 05:42.250
Take a fun family photo with
Bernie for the nursery scrapbook.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.290
Fun? That sounds ominous.

05:44.340 --> 05:48.170
Some people take their fun a
little more seriously than others.

05:48.220 --> 05:52.530
By 'some people', I'm guessing
you mean Angela Besbrode.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.250
Just because she's a solicitor.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.330
I can cope with her patronising
chats outside the nursery gates.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.130
She said something about
teachers' holidays, didn't she?

06:00.180 --> 06:02.570
'How wonderful to have all that time off.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.730
I only wish I worked till three o'clock.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.650
Whatever do you do with yourself?'

06:06.700 --> 06:09.570
She's the one with
enough time on her hands

06:09.620 --> 06:12.050
to take Bernie the Badger up Kilimanjaro.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.050
- Really?
- Really.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.020
Barnaby.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.240
OK. And where's the crime scene?

06:23.820 --> 06:26.850
Bellville Hall? I can find it.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.570
Bellville Hall? We were there
yesterday for the pet show.

06:30.620 --> 06:34.290
- Is everything OK?
- They found a body in the marquee.

06:34.340 --> 06:36.810
Oh, no! Well, you'd better go.

06:40.260 --> 06:43.420
Now then, what are we
going to do with you?

07:08.780 --> 07:11.730
- Hi there.
- I'd like a room.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.410
Yes, of course.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.090
There you are. How many nights?

07:16.140 --> 07:18.890
Just a couple, but I
may stay a bit longer.

07:18.940 --> 07:21.330
OK. Just fill that out.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.290
I assume you're here for the pet show.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.450
I'm not. Is that a problem?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.890
No, not at all. Is just, during the show,

07:28.940 --> 07:31.490
we have an open-door policy
when it comes to pets,

07:31.540 --> 07:35.850
and as my wife keeps reminding me,
not everyone is an animal lover.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.970
So perhaps I'll pop you in the annex.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.450
No! No, you shouldn't.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.610
The air-conditioning unit, remember?
It's like a fridge in there.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.450
I thought Jayesh was seeing to that.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.640
He's waiting on a part.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.650
Fine. Er, Room 3, then.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.010
- Right.
- It's just as nice.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.170
Through the door, up the stairs.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.770
- You checking in? What's the
name, please? - Sprinkles.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.970
Sprinkles. Sprinkles...

08:02.020 --> 08:03.940
Sorry -- YOUR name.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.330
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

08:21.380 --> 08:25.410
Victim is Seb Huntington, works
at the local estate agent's.

08:25.460 --> 08:27.890
His parents live abroad,
but they've been informed.

08:27.940 --> 08:32.250
- I assume the security guard found the body.
- You'd think so, but no.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.010
He was asleep on the job --
didn't hear or see anything.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.289
- So who found him?
- Ailsa Benson.

08:37.340 --> 08:40.450
She has a stall at the pet show,
so she was here early to set up.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.730
She said she realised something was wrong

08:42.780 --> 08:45.010
when she saw some rabbits.

08:45.060 --> 08:49.130
- I'm sorry? - It's all a
little bit Alice In Wonderland.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.020
Perhaps you should see for yourself.

09:08.700 --> 09:12.490
Hello. I'm Dr Oliver Marcet.
I'm standing in for Dr Karimore.

09:12.540 --> 09:14.770
- That's news to me.
- It was all very last-minute.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.810
She's been asked to teach on a
course. She'll be away for a month.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.450
A month?

09:19.500 --> 09:22.690
- Shall we get on?
- Well, as you can see,

09:22.740 --> 09:24.330
the scene is pretty contaminated.

09:24.380 --> 09:29.290
The body has been here all
night but we're doing our best.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.970
- Cause of death?
- Stab wound to the neck.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.890
I suspect it caught the carotid artery,

09:33.940 --> 09:37.570
causing rapid exsanguination.
He'd have been dead within minutes.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.810
Do we know how the killer
went about the attack?

09:39.860 --> 09:42.410
From the position of
the wound and the body,

09:42.460 --> 09:44.490
I'd say he was attacked from the front.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.450
Looks like there was a struggle at first.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.570
- Murder weapon?
- Hasn't been left at the scene

09:48.620 --> 09:51.130
but I should be able to
work out what blade was used.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.930
I'll need at least another hour
before I can remove the body.

09:53.980 --> 09:58.180
Understood. We'll get uniform
to search the grounds.

10:00.180 --> 10:03.090
Do we think the killer
also let out the rabbits?

10:03.140 --> 10:05.970
And the victim disturbed them? Possibly.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.930
Or could have been the other way round.

10:07.980 --> 10:12.100
Why would anyone want to
release them in the first place?

10:14.540 --> 10:18.210
At first, I saw the
rabbits. That was bad enough.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.730
I mean, the damage that's been done.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.690
They seem pretty happy.

10:22.740 --> 10:26.050
A little TOO happy. They're not just pets.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.610
I'm married to a champion breeder,

10:28.660 --> 10:31.410
so I know how seriously they take it all.

10:31.460 --> 10:34.410
I suspect a few breeding programmes
have been ruined overnight.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.410
Once the rabbits were
loose, they probably...

10:37.460 --> 10:40.060
It is what rabbits are famous for.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.370
I assume the breeders
are also your customers.

10:43.420 --> 10:46.130
- You run a pet-supply store?
- That's right.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.810
- You were here first thing?
- And late last night.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.290
It's my busiest time of year.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.690
It was about eight when
I finished packing up.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.410
And you went straight home?

10:55.460 --> 10:58.690
To my shop in the village. I
needed to do a stock-take.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.880
Can anyone verify that?

11:02.540 --> 11:04.810
- No.
- What about your husband?

11:04.860 --> 11:07.770
We're not living together at the moment.

11:07.820 --> 11:10.730
Did you see Seb Huntington
at the show during the day?

11:10.780 --> 11:12.530
He was with Tegan.

11:12.580 --> 11:16.170
Tegan Langton. She works
for the owner of the Hall.

11:16.220 --> 11:19.210
She was Seb's girlfriend, poor thing.

11:19.260 --> 11:22.260
Far too young to have her heart broken.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.610
I wasn't even that interested at first.

11:26.660 --> 11:31.770
I thought he was a bit
flash, a bit full of himself,

11:31.820 --> 11:36.810
and I thought he was just passing
through on his way to the big time.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.410
I didn't want a fling with someone

11:38.460 --> 11:40.930
that would be here today
and gone tomorrow.

11:40.980 --> 11:42.650
What changed your mind?

11:42.700 --> 11:46.450
Well, once you got past the flashiness,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.690
he was just a really nice guy,

11:48.740 --> 11:52.130
and he seemed to really fall in
love with Bellville, didn't he?

11:52.180 --> 11:55.690
I don't think it was the village
he was falling in love with, Tegan.

11:55.740 --> 11:57.530
You were all friends?

11:57.580 --> 12:00.450
I worked with Seb at Eden and
Moss, the estate agent's.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.850
Tegan and I are old school friends.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.610
So last night, Seb was here to see you?

12:06.660 --> 12:10.450
No. We didn't have any
plans, he knew how busy I was.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.490
But you'd been together earlier?

12:12.540 --> 12:14.650
We'd managed to get five minutes together

12:14.700 --> 12:17.490
but that was it until after the pet show.

12:17.540 --> 12:20.850
If I'd known it would be
our last five minutes...

12:20.900 --> 12:23.010
So where were you last night?

12:23.060 --> 12:26.730
Oh, here. I live in at the house.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.450
Delphi and I were discussing
what needed to be done today,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.970
then I went to bed, I was so tired.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.090
Can Miss Hartley confirm that?

12:34.140 --> 12:36.140
I don't see why not.

12:37.660 --> 12:41.250
It's fine at the moment, but winter
will be upon us before we know it.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.410
- I get that.
- And without the new oil tank,

12:44.460 --> 12:46.410
the Hall will be rather chilly.

12:46.460 --> 12:49.850
Look, darling, I've ordered
the concrete for the base.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.330
If I can't pay for it, I
can't do my job, can I?

12:53.380 --> 12:57.250
Jayesh, I can assure you it's not a
lack of funds that is the problem,

12:57.300 --> 12:59.730
it's merely a lack of time.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.410
Tegan manages all the finances,
and with the pet show...

13:02.460 --> 13:07.180
Fine. But I need the money by tomorrow.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.250
Miss Hartley. DCI Barnaby, Causton CID.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.050
- This is DS Winter.
- Hello.

13:17.100 --> 13:21.050
- I wonder if we might have a word.
- Oh, of course.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.690
I was dead to the world last night.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.450
A symphony orchestra could
have been playing in my bedroom

13:26.500 --> 13:28.690
and I would not have stirred.

13:28.740 --> 13:32.130
It sounds like the pet show
is a great deal of hard work.

13:32.180 --> 13:36.450
Oh, it is, but I do love
it so, everybody does.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.090
Everybody?

13:38.140 --> 13:42.370
Everybody! It's lovely, it's
the happiest week of the year.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.930
Well, perhaps not this
year. Poor Sebastian.

13:45.980 --> 13:49.970
It's possible that someone was
trying to sabotage the show.

13:50.020 --> 13:52.890
I find that very hard to believe.

13:52.940 --> 13:56.570
Yet the cages were open,
the animals were loose

13:56.620 --> 13:59.490
and there was a dead body amongst them.

14:00.740 --> 14:05.970
Gentlemen, there has been a pet show
at Bellville Hall for over 50 years,

14:06.020 --> 14:10.730
and in all that time, we have
never had so much as a cross word.

14:10.780 --> 14:14.290
Is this how you make your
living, from the pet show?

14:14.340 --> 14:16.170
Good grief, no!

14:16.220 --> 14:17.970
It hardly breaks even.

14:18.020 --> 14:22.170
If we didn't have our sponsor,
we'd have to call it a day.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.410
So for the rest of the year?

14:24.460 --> 14:26.330
I'm an author.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.130
- Anything we might have read?
- Perhaps.

14:29.180 --> 14:32.020
Do you read much historical romance?

14:34.860 --> 14:37.410
I'm more of a Stephen King fan myself.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.330
You do surprise me.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.370
- So what do you think?
- It's all lovely --

14:43.420 --> 14:45.890
lovely Seb Huntington,
the lovely estate agent...

14:45.940 --> 14:48.450
- Suspicious, for a start.
- .. in a lovely relationship

14:48.500 --> 14:51.410
with his lovely girlfriend, who
works for the lovely pet show

14:51.460 --> 14:53.930
which everybody loves. Lovely.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.650
Except for the dead
body covered in rabbits.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.970
Let's go speak to his boss.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.690
Seb Huntington didn't
just work with you...

15:13.740 --> 15:18.850
FOR me. He worked for me.
I'm the branch manager.

15:18.900 --> 15:22.450
He didn't just work for you, he
was also seeing your daughter.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.330
- Sounds like it was quite serious.
- Yes. Tegan's very upset.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.490
I'm heading to the show
to see her shortly.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.650
They were both still very young.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.570
He'd only been in Bellville six months.

15:31.620 --> 15:35.530
In that time, had he crossed
anyone, any dissatisfied customers,

15:35.580 --> 15:39.570
house sales fallen through,
anyone been gazumped?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.890
No, no. He was doing very well.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.850
We're going to need to take this.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.370
Of course.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.570
Help yourself.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.130
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

15:52.180 --> 15:57.130
Sorry. Pet allergies. I always
struggle during show week.

15:57.180 --> 15:59.130
Are you a competitor?

15:59.180 --> 16:03.770
Yes. I have a rabbit, Agamemnon.
His judging class is tomorrow.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.890
He's a Silver Fox.

16:05.940 --> 16:07.810
And you're allergic to him?

16:07.860 --> 16:10.010
It's developed over the years.

16:10.060 --> 16:13.530
Agamemnon is short-haired, so I
only have a mild reaction to him,

16:13.580 --> 16:16.770
and I stay well clear of
the long-haired breeds.

16:16.820 --> 16:20.090
As long as I keep taking
the tablets, it's fine.

16:20.140 --> 16:23.330
This is Shray, our lettings agent.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.250
- We met earlier.
- Hi.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.970
I need the keys for Rose Cottage.
The Laytons have decided to sell.

16:29.020 --> 16:31.050
But I had a tenant lined up.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.210
It doesn't matter now, does it?

16:33.260 --> 16:35.290
No.

16:35.340 --> 16:40.330
Mr Varma, I didn't ask earlier, but
were you at the pet show yesterday?

16:40.380 --> 16:43.650
Yeah, helping my dad. He's
a rabbit breeder as well.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.690
And did you see Seb at any time?

16:46.740 --> 16:49.170
I did, actually. He was
talking to Timothy Benson.

16:49.220 --> 16:51.050
Any relation of Ailsa Benson?

16:51.100 --> 16:52.570
Yeah, he's her husband.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.850
How would you characterise
their conversation,

16:55.900 --> 16:57.650
was it chatty, friendly?

16:57.700 --> 17:01.170
It looked like an argument to me.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.290
Any idea what they were arguing about?

17:04.339 --> 17:08.690
It might be nothing, but ever
since the Bensons split up,

17:08.740 --> 17:10.530
Seb's been trying to get the sale.

17:10.579 --> 17:13.170
- Sale?
- The shop and the house.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.170
Seb said, if they were getting a divorce,

17:15.220 --> 17:17.619
he wanted in on the carve-up.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.569
Maybe not quite so lovely.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.890
Thank you for your cooperation.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.690
You will be able to
retrieve your pets shortly.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.690
What were discussing with Mr Huntington?

17:39.740 --> 17:43.370
- Hm? I don't really remember.
- Perhaps I can jog your memory --

17:43.420 --> 17:46.650
selling your properties as part
of your divorce settlement?

17:46.700 --> 17:49.410
Look, I'll tell you what I told him --

17:49.460 --> 17:52.290
we're not getting divorced, not yet.

17:52.340 --> 17:55.930
I'm living temporarily
at my daughter's hotel.

17:55.980 --> 17:57.450
There's a lot to sort out,

17:57.500 --> 18:01.450
and the last thing I needed was him
hovering over me like a vulture.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.770
Mr Benson, where were you last night?

18:04.820 --> 18:08.300
I was at the shop I run with my wife.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.890
Can anyone verify that?

18:11.940 --> 18:14.140
I was the only one there.

18:21.220 --> 18:24.220
- You can let them back in now.
- Thank you.

18:25.860 --> 18:31.060
Right, well, if you'll excuse me, I
need to go and check on my rabbit.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.770
Miss Langton, I have to ask you...

18:47.820 --> 18:49.610
Help!

18:49.660 --> 18:52.010
Will somebody help me, please?

18:52.060 --> 18:55.180
It's an emergency. Quick, please come!

18:56.300 --> 18:57.970
Mr Benson, are you OK?

18:58.020 --> 19:01.610
Of course I'm not. Look -- he's gone.

19:01.660 --> 19:04.130
Hercules is gone.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.120
Someone's taken him.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.350
How much would you pay for a rabbit?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.510
Am I keeping it or eating it?

19:35.560 --> 19:37.550
You're breeding it.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.830
I've just had an interesting conversation

19:39.880 --> 19:43.190
with the Chair of MSPA, the
Midsomer Small Pets Association.

19:43.240 --> 19:47.270
Hercules had been offered out to
stud through their rabbit registry.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.950
A dating agency for rabbits?
And they say romance is dead.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.430
Timothy Benson was
offering Hercules' services

19:55.480 --> 19:58.830
at £200 per successful date.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.790
So Hercules could be worth thousands.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.070
No wonder Timothy Benson
was so distraught.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.630
So do we think that Seb
Huntington disturbed a thief

20:08.680 --> 20:10.150
and not a saboteur?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.550
Well, on the sabotage angle,

20:12.600 --> 20:14.430
I called the editor of the local paper

20:14.480 --> 20:16.270
to see if there'd been complaints.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.910
These things usually do
play out in the local press.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.430
Miss Hartley was pretty
much telling the truth --

20:21.480 --> 20:23.670
people love the show,
it's always front-page.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.790
- Fluffy bunnies.
- Exactly.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.430
The only thing I could find in the archive

20:28.480 --> 20:30.430
was a letter published in the '90s.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.870
It claimed that pet shows
were cruel to animals

20:33.920 --> 20:36.430
and robbed them of their natural dignity.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.910
- Who's this letter from?
- Perry Tressel.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.910
He owns the Bellville Country
Hotel in the village these days.

20:41.960 --> 20:46.550
He's also married to Ailsa and
Timothy Benson's daughter Belinda.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.550
Ah, the Benson family. They do
keep popping up, don't they?

20:50.600 --> 20:53.630
We already know that either
Ailsa or Timothy are liars,

20:53.680 --> 20:56.750
unless they both managed to
do a stock check in their shop

20:56.800 --> 20:58.270
without noticing each other.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.070
Go and talk to Ailsa Benson.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.470
I'll speak to their daughter Belinda

21:03.520 --> 21:07.800
and to the Midsomer Animals
Are People Too campaigner.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.430
- What letter?
- It was quite a few years ago.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.430
It was about the pet show.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.230
Good grief!

21:18.280 --> 21:20.310
It really was years ago.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.950
I was a teenager.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.150
I'd been listening to a lot of
Chumbawamba and The Levellers.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.470
So you support the pet show?

21:27.520 --> 21:31.110
If anything, it supports ME.
It's our busiest time of year.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.550
Look, I'm still not a
fan of animals in cages,

21:33.600 --> 21:36.750
which is why we've got an open-door
policy for animals at the hotel.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.510
That's quite unusual, I should imagine.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.950
It was my mum and dad's
idea. I grew up at the hotel.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.270
I used to love meeting the
pets during show week --

21:46.320 --> 21:49.950
hamsters at the breakfast
table, gerbils in the corridors.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.790
- Sounds idyllic.
- It was to me,

21:52.840 --> 21:57.270
which is why, when my mum and dad
passed on and I took this place on,

21:57.320 --> 22:00.960
I didn't see any reason to change things.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.070
It would have been nice
to hear from my husband

22:05.120 --> 22:06.790
that he was filing for divorce,

22:06.840 --> 22:11.030
but I had to hear it from a
jumped-up little estate agent.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.350
- You didn't know?
- I hadn't a clue,

22:13.400 --> 22:16.070
not until Seb Huntington came oiling,

22:16.120 --> 22:19.150
asking about room dimensions
and council-tax bandings.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.710
Have you discussed this with your husband?

22:21.760 --> 22:24.910
Why should I? He's the one who walked out.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.070
If he wants a divorce, fine.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.110
I just wish he'd get
it over with and stop...

22:30.160 --> 22:31.990
.. stop dragging it out.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.580
Would you like a hand with that?

22:42.720 --> 22:45.510
How many years have you had
a stall at the pet show?

22:45.560 --> 22:48.390
Too many. In fact, this might be my last.

22:48.440 --> 22:53.030
- Why's that? - This used to be the
most profitable week of the year,

22:53.080 --> 22:55.910
but with increased pitch fees,
I'll be lucky to turn a profit.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.670
- Have they gone up?
- They've doubled.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.710
Listen, don't let Delphi
Hartley's act fool you.

23:01.760 --> 23:06.350
- Her act? - I know she comes
across all sweetness and light.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.870
When I asked her why the
fees were so high this year,

23:08.920 --> 23:12.590
she told me that she welcomed my feedback.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.950
- But she didn't?
- Considering she's put my stall

23:16.000 --> 23:19.950
next to the chemical toilets
this year, you tell me.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.590
Just one more thing, Mrs Benson --

23:22.640 --> 23:25.870
you told DCI Barnaby and myself
you were here last night...

23:25.920 --> 23:27.670
- That's right.
- .. doing a stock check.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.670
- That's right.
- With your husband?

23:29.720 --> 23:33.270
Heavens, no! He'd just
have got under my feet.

23:33.320 --> 23:37.080
Have you got any, erm,
paperwork I could look at?

23:39.200 --> 23:40.910
Not really.

23:40.960 --> 23:45.790
It wasn't a formal stock check,
just checking things, really.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.590
I see.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.750
It seems a strange time to do it --

23:49.800 --> 23:52.710
you're so busy at the
show, working long hours.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.300
I like to keep on top of things.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.030
Thank you, Mrs Benson.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.430
Thanks very much. Thank you.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.310
He's absolutely beside himself.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.350
Of course, maybe it's
a blessing in disguise.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.710
- How so?
- With no rabbit to argue over,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.270
maybe Mum and Dad will see
sense and get back together.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.590
They split up over the rabbit?

24:22.640 --> 24:26.230
Not for the first time. It's
the same before every show.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.910
Dad gets obsessive, Mum feels
neglected, they have a huge row

24:29.960 --> 24:31.430
and he walks out.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.390
It usually doesn't last
more than a few days.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.630
How long has it gone on this time?

24:36.680 --> 24:38.830
A couple of months,

24:38.880 --> 24:41.910
and it doesn't help that the
shop is struggling financially.

24:41.960 --> 24:46.590
- What did you do?
- I coaxed him out with some sweetcorn.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.550
It turns out hamsters love sweetcorn.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.200
Oh (!)

24:52.840 --> 24:56.910
I can't believe you've got
the nerve to show your face.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.310
Timothy! Are you OK?

24:59.360 --> 25:01.270
Always jealous of him, weren't you?

25:01.320 --> 25:04.270
Hercules? I admired him,
yes. He was a champion.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.750
Yes, but you wanted your
own champion, didn't you?

25:07.800 --> 25:11.270
Couldn't manage it yourself,
so you decided to take mine.

25:11.320 --> 25:16.430
Mr Benson, I find public accusations
tend to do more harm than good.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.750
- If you have any information...
- OK, fine.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.310
Why don't you tell him
how much you offered me

25:22.360 --> 25:26.110
for the stud rights to Hercules,
exclusive rights, no less.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.070
- Is this true?
- Yes, I made him an offer.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.470
See? There you go -- she admits it.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.830
Timothy, that's enough! If you can't
behave in a civilised manner...

25:34.880 --> 25:37.230
You're not taking her
side, are you, Perry?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.950
Your dad needs to calm down.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.230
I agree. Mr Benson, if you
wish to make a statement...

25:42.280 --> 25:44.550
Oh, I believe I just have.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.030
- What are YOU doing here?
- What do you think?

25:57.080 --> 25:59.670
I told Dad I'D get the rabbit food.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.670
'Course you did. Real Daddy's boy.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.260
I'll bring it when I'm finished.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.480
Fine. I'll see you later.

26:14.360 --> 26:18.350
So, er, where DO you
keep your rabbit food?

26:18.400 --> 26:21.700
You'll have to come
through to the back room.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.560
Morning.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.990
Oliver's finished with
the PM, when you're ready.

26:50.040 --> 26:53.390
Briar's Pet Foods no
longer wish to be associated

26:53.440 --> 26:56.270
with the Bellville Hall Small Pets Show.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.350
Delphi Hartley has lost her sponsorship.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.110
I'm not surprised.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.150
'The show is nothing short of a shambles,

27:02.200 --> 27:05.430
with organisation so poor
it verges on the negligent.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.430
I am shocked that you would
associate yourself with this debacle

27:08.480 --> 27:11.550
and will no longer be purchasing
any Briar's Pet Food products.'

27:11.600 --> 27:14.350
- Where did you find that?
- Seb Huntington's laptop.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.630
He wrote similar letters to the
Midsomer Small Pets Association

27:17.680 --> 27:19.550
and some animal-welfare charities.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.070
Why?

27:21.120 --> 27:25.830
I'm not entirely sure, but I
did find an email correspondence

27:25.880 --> 27:29.990
between Seb and the regional manager
of Eden and Moss estate agents,

27:30.040 --> 27:33.560
or as Seb likes to call him, Uncle Peter.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.550
Well? The rabbit food.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.070
Oh. Er, Jayesh is getting it.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.670
- Jayesh? - Yeah. He said
he'd bring it when he was done.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.750
Done with what? Never
mind, I don't want to know.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.800
I'm sorry, son.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.230
It's these painkillers. I don't
know whether I'm coming or going.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.790
It's OK, Dad. It's all right.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.070
You know what would make
you feel better, right?

28:17.120 --> 28:21.110
Winning Best in Show, and with
Hercules out of contention...

28:21.160 --> 28:23.670
Come on, you know how
Timothy must be feeling.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.630
I'd rather win fair and square.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.990
- I know, but...
- Whoever took that rabbit

28:28.040 --> 28:29.630
is no friend of mine.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.430
Do you understand?

28:31.480 --> 28:33.480
Yeah, 'course I do.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.990
Cause of death was as I theorised --

28:38.040 --> 28:40.550
stab wound to the neck
puncturing the carotid artery.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.390
- He would have bled out quickly.
- Thoughts about the weapon?

28:43.440 --> 28:47.390
A double puncture wound inflicted by
two pointed blades simultaneously.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.270
- Two blades?
- Scissors, open scissors.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.790
That would be consistent.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.270
The blades were long and thin,
possibly hairdressing scissors.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.430
Or grooming scissors. Rabbit
fanciers use them for trimming fur.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.390
- That makes sense.
- Doesn't really narrow things down.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.870
There must be dozens of pairs at the show.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.520
- Thank you, Dr Marcet.
- Mm-hm.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.470
Have you... Have you heard from Kam?

29:13.520 --> 29:16.950
Yeah, she called earlier
to check up on things.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.950
Is she having a good time?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.430
Have you ever been on
those residential courses?

29:21.480 --> 29:24.070
- A long time ago.
- Then you'll know what they're like --

29:24.120 --> 29:26.060
more play than work.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.630
Yeah.

29:30.680 --> 29:35.040
Well, when your boss wants you
to give his nephew a job...

29:36.840 --> 29:40.590
Look, he pulled off a
couple of good sales,

29:40.640 --> 29:42.630
suddenly he's Salesman of the Year.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.270
Then he wasn't satisfied with
what he had on his books,

29:45.320 --> 29:47.230
he wanted what was on mine too.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.430
Including Bellville Hall?

29:49.480 --> 29:52.470
I had no idea he was sniffing
round Bellville Hall.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.470
If I had, I could have told
him he's wasting his time.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.790
- Why? - I have been
working on Delphi for years.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.510
The place is far too big for her.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.590
It must cost a fortune
to keep it ticking over.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.270
But every time I try to
talk to her about selling,

30:08.320 --> 30:10.710
I get the same answer, a hard no.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.790
How much do you think that
had to do with the pet show?

30:13.840 --> 30:17.070
Everything. I've said
we can find a new venue,

30:17.120 --> 30:20.230
but she says it wouldn't be
the Bellville Hall Pet Show

30:20.280 --> 30:22.820
unless it was at Bellville Hall.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.990
How did you feel when your
daughter started seeing Seb?

30:27.040 --> 30:30.950
Tegan's a smart girl. She'd
have seen through him eventually.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.670
Though you couldn't be
sure of that, could you?

30:33.720 --> 30:36.630
Where were you last night, Ms Langton?

30:36.680 --> 30:39.080
I was here, working...

30:40.080 --> 30:42.430
.. alone.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.750
Tim, I want to talk to you.

30:45.760 --> 30:50.110
I was sorry to hear about Hercules.
I know how much he meant to you.

30:50.160 --> 30:54.230
- Oh, here we go!
- No, I wasn't having a go, I promise.

30:54.280 --> 30:58.190
I don't think you should be
working, not after a shock like that.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.350
That's...

31:00.400 --> 31:02.830
That's very decent of you.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.550
Just because we're...

31:05.600 --> 31:09.110
Doesn't mean I've stopped caring.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.160
Thank you.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.950
Delphi Hartley said that the
pet show barely broke even

32:18.000 --> 32:20.710
and without sponsorship,
it would be all over.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.070
It's a big house for one
woman and her assistant.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.390
And without the pet show, she
has no real reason to stay.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.110
You think Seb worked that out?

32:28.160 --> 32:31.990
I think that's why he was trying
to scupper the sponsorship deal.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.830
That would explain something
Forensics have sent through.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.790
They found multiple prints
on the cages in the marquee.

32:37.840 --> 32:41.670
- Not surprisingly. - But they
found multiple examples of one set,

32:41.720 --> 32:44.350
the victim's.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.550
Seb Huntington was sabotaging the show

32:47.600 --> 32:49.550
to get Delphi Hartley to sell the Hall.

32:49.600 --> 32:54.150
Check out the Bensons' conflicting
alibis, I'll talk to Miss Hartley.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.600
Meet me back at the pet show.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.510
Cleo! I'm not sure it's a
good idea for you to be here.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.430
- I need to look at the register. - OK.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.590
Oh!

33:10.640 --> 33:12.230
- He's here.
- What's going on?

33:12.280 --> 33:16.030
Room 3. I'm going to need
you to show me his room.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.870
- I can't do that.
- Oh, please, Perry.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.680
I'll explain everything.
Please just trust me.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.480
Come on.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.360
Mini-bar?

33:55.360 --> 33:56.830
Oh.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.220
That's something, I suppose.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.000
Oh! Now I've got a viewing.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.159
Cleo, what is going on?

34:09.560 --> 34:11.429
Do you remember I told you once

34:11.480 --> 34:14.750
that I had to tell a terrible
lie to protect someone?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.800
I do.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.989
It's him?

34:20.040 --> 34:22.030
What are you going to do?

34:22.080 --> 34:24.710
I don't know.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.750
But now, I've got to go.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.400
So thank you, Perry, and I'm sorry.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.949
I was just about to give Lizzie
a bath, ready for her big day,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.550
but I'm sure I can spare a few moments.

34:43.600 --> 34:46.190
- Not writing?
- No.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.550
The muse isn't with me today.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.870
I understand she hasn't been
with you for quite some time.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.389
I'm sorry?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.350
I spoke to your literary agent.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.870
She told me your latest
manuscript has been rejected

34:59.920 --> 35:02.670
- by your publishers.
- Not rejected,

35:02.720 --> 35:05.590
I've simply been asked to make revisions.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.350
It's a new editor, she's
keen to make her mark.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.710
She wants me to explore
more contemporary themes.

35:11.760 --> 35:15.800
- Contemporary?
- She wants me to put in a bit more smut.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.030
A delay in publication
means a delay in payment.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.150
Doesn't that leave you in a
financially precarious position?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.870
I'm sure I'll manage.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.070
Yet you've had to put up pitch
fees for this year's show.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.750
I kept them down as long as I could.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.430
A house of this size -- running
costs must be considerable.

35:35.480 --> 35:40.110
Why is everybody obsessed with
money and costs these days?

35:40.160 --> 35:42.110
I find it so distasteful.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.590
Has someone shown an
interest in your finances,

35:44.640 --> 35:47.350
Seb Huntington, by any chance?

35:47.400 --> 35:50.590
I suppose it's an occupational hazard.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.560
Even Tegan was getting
tired of all his questions.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.020
Who left this here?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.940
Through here, Mr Lewis!

36:35.000 --> 36:38.360
I thought we'd, erm, start in the kitchen.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.960
Mr Lewis?

36:56.200 --> 36:58.070
I've already told you!

36:58.120 --> 37:00.990
I just need you to confirm --
were you in the shop last night?

37:01.040 --> 37:04.070
No, he wasn't. He was in here.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.910
- Really? - Propped up
the bar all night long.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.790
- Is this true? - He always gets
like this during the pet show --

37:11.840 --> 37:16.270
literally doesn't know what day
of the week it is. Do you, Dad?

37:16.320 --> 37:19.190
- Thursday?
- See?

37:19.240 --> 37:21.510
Clearly, a confusing time.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.950
What did you say that for?!

37:32.000 --> 37:35.550
In case you haven't noticed, I
do everything in this place --

37:35.600 --> 37:40.990
I am the barmaid, the chambermaid,
the receptionist, the night porter,

37:41.040 --> 37:43.910
which is why I know that you
didn't return to your bedroom

37:43.960 --> 37:45.870
until the early hours of the morning.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.960
- Right.
- Care to explain why?

37:51.160 --> 37:55.550
Listen, you don't have to
worry about anything, OK?

37:55.600 --> 37:58.360
I've got everything under control.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.630
Dad, that's not an answer.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.910
Dad!

38:02.960 --> 38:07.590
Fifteen years, Errol. Fifteen years!

38:07.640 --> 38:09.910
How did you expect me to react?

38:09.960 --> 38:12.950
I didn't expect you to try to run me over.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.470
That was a warm welcome

38:14.520 --> 38:18.150
compared to what I've imagined
doing to you since you left.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.950
I probably would have
deserved it, back then.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.430
Right. Sorry -- is this the bit
where you tell me you've changed?

38:25.480 --> 38:27.870
Yeah, because I have.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.790
- No.
- I'm not the man I was, Cleo.

38:30.840 --> 38:35.030
The drinking, everything
-- that has all gone.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.750
I know I've said that before.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.670
Cut to the chase, Errol.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.550
I want to see her.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.280
What?

38:45.640 --> 38:47.230
No.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.750
No!

38:48.800 --> 38:53.430
I don't think that's your
choice to make, not any more.

38:53.480 --> 38:57.520
I'm going to see her, with
or without your blessing.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.990
That was just a little too convenient.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.950
Belinda Tressel providing her
father with an eleventh-hour alibi?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.550
You and your suspicious nature.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.150
One of the Benson family is
lying about where they were

39:21.200 --> 39:23.150
when Seb Huntington died.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.200
Only one of them.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.310
I'm looking for Perry.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.070
Haven't you seen enough of him today?

39:33.120 --> 39:37.070
I don't have time for the green-eyed
monster today. Is he here?

39:37.120 --> 39:38.960
No. Sorry.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.350
Oh!

39:52.400 --> 39:56.150
I'm sorry, this area's not open
to the public. You can't be here.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.670
I didn't mean to frighten
you. I'm looking for Tegan.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.550
Why, what do you want?

40:01.600 --> 40:06.160
I just want to talk to her. I
just want to talk to my daughter.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.110
No, not today. I haven't got the patience.

40:18.160 --> 40:21.310
- Where have I heard that before?
- Whatever!

40:21.360 --> 40:25.070
Honestly! You and your dad
have wasted enough of my time.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.830
Sounds about right. Always
in too much of a rush

40:28.880 --> 40:31.750
to think about other people, aren't you?

40:31.800 --> 40:33.800
You'd better come in.

40:44.160 --> 40:47.830
Before you say anything, I need
you to know that everything I did,

40:47.880 --> 40:52.030
- everything, was for the best.
- You told me my father was dead.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.670
- To protect you.
- To protect yourself,

40:54.720 --> 40:57.070
to save yourself from having to explain.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.910
She didn't need to know.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.790
Of course I did!

41:00.840 --> 41:05.190
He's my father, I needed to
know what he was going through.

41:05.240 --> 41:07.030
Going through?

41:07.080 --> 41:09.990
What he was... Yes, of course, sorry.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.950
This is about your pain
and your suffering.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.110
You haven't changed one iota, have you?

41:15.160 --> 41:18.190
- That's quite enough.
- Thank you, Delphi.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.990
This is between my daughter.
My daughter, not yours.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.200
Don't you dare speak to Delphi like that!

41:26.400 --> 41:29.960
She has been more of a
mother to me than you have.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.830
How can you say that?

41:32.880 --> 41:36.310
For one thing, you must
have known what Seb was up to

41:36.360 --> 41:38.870
but you never spoke to me about it.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.430
- Would you have listened?
- That's not the point,

41:41.480 --> 41:44.710
and you know it.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.880
I think you should go.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.390
Tegan!

41:51.440 --> 41:53.440
You heard the girl.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.160
It's all arranged.

42:30.480 --> 42:32.480
Oh, no!

42:35.560 --> 42:38.670
Tim! I wasn't expecting
to see you again today.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.470
Clearly.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.550
I can explain.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.960
Oh, I bet you can.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.480
Paddy, you didn't?

44:30.800 --> 44:32.800
You did!

44:34.840 --> 44:39.510
- Oh, no! - Sarah, it's
probably not as bad as it looks.

44:39.560 --> 44:42.910
Well, tell that to Angela-bloomin'-Besbrode!

44:42.960 --> 44:46.390
She took Bernie up a mountain
and he barely lost a stitch.

44:46.440 --> 44:49.630
Five minutes in the Barnaby
household, and look at him!

44:49.680 --> 44:51.630
It's been a bad week for small animals.

44:51.680 --> 44:56.190
First the rabbitnapping, now
a dog-on-badger hate crime.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.150
Someone stole a rabbit from the pet show?

44:58.200 --> 45:00.670
Not just any rabbit, a champion rabbit.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.310
Oh, no, not Hercules?

45:02.360 --> 45:04.750
Well, yes. How did you know?

45:04.800 --> 45:06.670
We met him, Betty and I.

45:06.720 --> 45:09.950
I would show you the photos but his
owner wouldn't let me take any.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.830
- Really? - You'd think he'd be
proud of his prize-winning bunny.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.350
Yes, you would.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.230
I'd better get going.

45:20.280 --> 45:23.020
I'm sure you can deal with all this.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.470
No signs of trauma or struggle.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.230
She appears to have died
of respiratory distress,

45:38.280 --> 45:40.670
but until I can do a PM,
I'm not prepared to confirm.

45:40.720 --> 45:44.310
If I told you that Cleo Langton
had an allergy to rabbits,

45:44.360 --> 45:45.830
a recent development...

45:45.880 --> 45:48.950
Adult-onset allergies are not
that unusual and can be severe.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.510
I'll put an urgent request
in for her medical records.

45:51.560 --> 45:55.470
So this might not be a murder, it
could just be a bad asthma attack?

45:55.520 --> 45:57.790
I want everything here
bagged and catalogued.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.710
Of course.

45:59.760 --> 46:02.030
Were the car windows
shut when she was found?

46:02.080 --> 46:04.310
- Yes.
- Check the air vents.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.030
- Will do.
- Evidence bag, please.

46:15.040 --> 46:19.960
Let's see who Cleo Langton was
speaking to over the last few days.

46:21.440 --> 46:26.390
She appears to have had an
extreme allergic reaction.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.510
To rabbits? Of course.

46:30.080 --> 46:32.550
It's all right, love, I'm here.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.910
I don't believe we've been introduced.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.150
Errol Judd, Tegan's father.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.590
And Cleo Langton's ex-husband, I presume.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.910
That's right.

46:44.960 --> 46:47.710
- Do you live in Midsomer, Mr Judd?
- No, Thailand.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.390
I'm just over for a visit.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.750
When did you arrive back in the country?

46:51.800 --> 46:55.030
A couple of days ago. I'm staying
at the hotel in the village.

46:55.080 --> 46:59.390
Had you had any contact with
your ex-wife since your return?

46:59.440 --> 47:01.670
I saw her yesterday.

47:01.720 --> 47:05.110
- Where?
- Here at the Hall.

47:05.160 --> 47:08.030
A family reunion?

47:08.080 --> 47:12.030
Er, no, not really. Things
got a little heated.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.080
I told her to go.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.590
I want a background
check run on Errol Judd,

47:25.640 --> 47:27.550
Cleo Langton's ex-husband.

47:27.600 --> 47:30.310
- I didn't think he was in the
picture any more. - He's back.

47:30.360 --> 47:33.310
- Interesting timing.
- Anything on Cleo's phone?

47:33.360 --> 47:35.470
Most of her calls were to clients,

47:35.520 --> 47:38.350
but she'd had a series of calls
to a law firm here in Causton.

47:38.400 --> 47:43.030
She oversaw house sales. There's
plenty of legal paperwork involved.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.990
This firm specialises in
litigation and negligence cases.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.310
Someone was suing Cleo Langton.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.470
- Who?
- Dhruv Varma.

47:50.520 --> 47:55.030
I also found the last text message
the victim received before she died.

47:55.080 --> 47:59.640
'Who the hell do you think you
are? I'm going to make you pay'.

48:02.520 --> 48:07.190
Yeah. That only sounds bad
because she's ended up dead.

48:07.240 --> 48:12.070
It was just a threat when Cleo
Langton was still drawing breath,

48:12.120 --> 48:14.910
now it sounds a bit like a promise.

48:14.960 --> 48:18.750
OK, I was angry with her,
but I didn't kill her.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.830
Angry about your father's court case?

48:21.880 --> 48:24.070
There wasn't going to be a court case.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.750
Dad's already settled. It's over.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.830
How can it be over?
Look what she did to him.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.510
And I can't believe you
were still working for her.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.350
- It was an accident!
- A preventable accident.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.710
I used to think you were the
strongest man in the world.

48:36.760 --> 48:39.270
So did I, and then I fell off a roof.

48:39.320 --> 48:42.310
How was Cleo Langton involved in that?

48:42.360 --> 48:44.950
She wanted a quick sale on a house.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.110
I told her the chimney needed repointing.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.710
She asked me to sort it
before the surveyor turned up.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.950
I told her I needed to
wait for the scaffolding.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.230
And she told him that
either he got up a ladder

48:54.280 --> 48:56.710
or we'd never work for
Eden and Moss again.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.950
She forced him to work
in unsafe conditions.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.390
The settlement figure,
were you happy with it?

49:02.440 --> 49:04.910
- It's fine.
- It's an insult, Dad.

49:04.960 --> 49:08.110
It just about covers his legal costs.

49:08.160 --> 49:11.230
I couldn't face dragging it
through the courts for years.

49:11.280 --> 49:13.430
- I wanted it over with.
- If we had hung on...

49:13.480 --> 49:16.590
What do you mean, we? Dad's
the one in constant pain.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.230
- I know. That's why I think...
- You know what I think?

49:19.280 --> 49:21.150
I think you should concentrate on

49:21.200 --> 49:23.470
not running my business into the ground.

49:23.520 --> 49:27.870
I might not be much use on site
but I can still look at the books.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.920
Yes, Dad.

49:31.480 --> 49:35.550
I just don't know what to do, what to say.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.340
He's in pieces.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.910
See what I mean?

49:40.960 --> 49:43.670
This can't just be about
Hercules being stolen.

49:43.720 --> 49:47.350
I can't stand it. You've
got to do something, Mum.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.670
- What do you suggest?
- I've no idea.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.710
I've got my own problems to deal with.

49:51.760 --> 49:54.110
Darling, what's wrong?

49:54.160 --> 49:58.510
I've had enough of Perry going
to Cleo for advice on this place.

49:58.560 --> 50:02.910
And now she's dead. I want him
to realise I have ideas too.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.990
I just want him to listen, Mum.

50:05.040 --> 50:08.200
I know the feeling, believe me.

50:09.280 --> 50:12.400
So I've decided to make him listen to me.

50:15.120 --> 50:18.790
Cleo was here yesterday but not for long.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.990
She had a viewing, she was also busy.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.870
Were you and Ms Langton good friends?

50:24.920 --> 50:28.990
We were. When Mum and Dad
died and I took on this place,

50:29.040 --> 50:32.550
she helped with the legal
stuff. She was amazing.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.590
She's been there for me ever since.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.870
I don't know how I'll run
this place without her input.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.870
Thank you, Mr Tressel.

50:39.920 --> 50:43.950
Is your father-in-law in
the hotel at the moment?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.430
- Timothy, please!
- I don't want it!

50:46.480 --> 50:50.910
I was perfectly happy with
what I was already drinking.

50:50.960 --> 50:54.990
Oh, here we go. Why can't a
man have a drink in peace?

50:55.040 --> 50:58.150
We need to talk to you about Cleo Langton.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.310
Yes. Yes, I'm very sad.

51:01.360 --> 51:05.830
Really? Because I was here when you
accused her of stealing Hercules.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.630
So?

51:07.680 --> 51:10.630
So were you aware of her allergies?

51:10.680 --> 51:12.990
Yes, but that was just one reason

51:13.040 --> 51:17.270
she should never have been
allowed anywhere near rabbits.

51:17.320 --> 51:20.510
I do hope you're taking this seriously.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.150
I've already had cause
to question your alibi

51:23.200 --> 51:25.310
for the night Seb Huntington died.

51:25.360 --> 51:29.030
No, er, she explained
-- Belinda explained.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.080
Yes, she did.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.310
Let me take this opportunity
to remind you all

51:35.360 --> 51:37.670
that lying to the police
and obstructing justice

51:37.720 --> 51:39.630
is a criminal offence.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.550
If there's anything any of
you feel the need to tell me,

51:42.600 --> 51:44.600
now is your chance.

51:52.560 --> 51:56.350
Look, it needs to stop, for Dad's sake.

51:56.400 --> 52:00.790
- What are you on about?
- I know what you're up to,

52:00.840 --> 52:03.230
and I know she's married.

52:03.280 --> 52:05.790
So? That's her problem.

52:05.840 --> 52:09.150
Typical. Not a thought
for anyone but yourself.

52:09.200 --> 52:13.590
Ooh! at least I know how
to get what I want, bruv.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.640
Man up.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.790
Good afternoon.

52:21.840 --> 52:25.550
You were right about the vents
-- we found rabbit hair in them.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.350
Could it have got there accidentally?

52:27.400 --> 52:29.630
Not unless she groomed
her rabbit in the car.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.950
- Seems unlikely.
- My theory is that someone put it there

52:33.000 --> 52:34.630
to trigger anaphylaxis.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.830
This is what I don't understand.
She was around rabbits all the time.

52:37.880 --> 52:42.190
It's about concentration, the reason
peanuts are banned on some airlines.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.430
For a nut-allergy sufferer,

52:44.480 --> 52:47.990
in a beer garden, if someone opens a
packet of dry-roasted, no problem,

52:48.040 --> 52:51.230
but on a plane with recirculated
air it could prove fatal.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.990
Like rabbit hair in a small car.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.870
Our victim's respiratory
system just shut down.

52:57.920 --> 53:02.150
What I don't understand is why
she didn't have medication on her.

53:02.200 --> 53:05.630
According to her GP, she had
prescriptions for inhalers,

53:05.680 --> 53:09.470
antihistamines, as well as
an epinephrine auto-injector,

53:09.520 --> 53:12.030
but there was nothing in her
bag, not even a cough sweet.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.630
If the murderer had access to her car,

53:14.680 --> 53:17.190
maybe they had access to her handbag.

53:17.240 --> 53:20.950
Is there any way we can identify
which rabbit the fur came from?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.590
- A DNA test?
- Something like that.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.710
The fur was cut, not pulled or shed,

53:25.760 --> 53:30.310
so the chances of finding a
viable DNA sample is negligible.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.150
But if I call in a couple of favours,

53:32.200 --> 53:34.990
I might be able to confirm
the rabbit's breed.

53:35.040 --> 53:38.430
- How quickly could you do that?
- I'll see if I can put a rush on it.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.960
I'd appreciate that. Thank you.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.230
Oh. Sorry, I was just on my way out.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.910
This won't take long.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.470
I was going to see Tegan.
She shouldn't be on her own.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.790
Her father is with her.

53:53.840 --> 53:56.430
Her father? I thought he was dead.

53:56.480 --> 53:59.670
The rumours of his demise had been
greatly exaggerated, apparently.

53:59.720 --> 54:03.110
We're tracing Cleo's movements yesterday.

54:03.160 --> 54:05.310
She had a viewing in the afternoon.

54:05.360 --> 54:08.870
Yeah, at Rose Cottage with... Mr Lewis.

54:08.920 --> 54:13.430
Are there details -- did he
leave a phone number, an address?

54:13.480 --> 54:16.510
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow.

54:16.560 --> 54:18.630
Are you sure, after Cleo?

54:18.680 --> 54:22.400
Yeah. That's why we need to get this done.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.110
Jayesh! Just the man.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.670
Just wondering if you had any
idea when you'd get that part.

54:34.720 --> 54:37.670
- What part?
- For the air-conditioning unit.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.590
- For the annex.
- I've no idea what you're talking about.

54:40.640 --> 54:43.920
And I'm a builder, not an electrician.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.110
Sir, this has just come through.

54:52.160 --> 54:55.440
Errol Judd has quite the criminal record.

54:57.480 --> 55:00.910
Hm. Mostly drink-related
public-order offences.

55:00.960 --> 55:03.270
A couple of driving bans

55:03.320 --> 55:07.630
and a subsequent conviction for
driving while disqualified.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.190
Nothing violent though.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.470
Still, I'd like to speak to him again.

55:11.520 --> 55:15.590
Follow up on Mr Lewis and
take a look at Rose Cottage.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.710
It could be where the killer
tampered with Cleo's car.

55:18.760 --> 55:20.430
Speak to the neighbours,

55:20.480 --> 55:25.040
- see if any of them noticed
anything out of the ordinary. - Sir.

55:45.280 --> 55:50.110
Next up, it's Boadicea and Perseus.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.150
I wanted to reconnect with my daughter,

55:52.200 --> 55:54.630
but I didn't know what I
might be walking into,

55:54.680 --> 55:57.630
although I never expected...

55:57.680 --> 56:02.230
Cleo told Tegan I was dead. Can you
imagine how it felt to hear that?

56:02.280 --> 56:04.110
You tell me.

56:04.160 --> 56:05.630
I was heartbroken.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.150
For almost 15 years,

56:07.200 --> 56:10.910
I was nothing more than a
footnote in my daughter's life.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.550
Well, that's all about to change.

56:13.600 --> 56:17.390
You have an interesting
police record, Mr Judd.

56:17.440 --> 56:20.990
Mm. That tends to happen when
you're a raging alcoholic.

56:21.040 --> 56:23.830
- Are you now in recovery?
- Yes,

56:23.880 --> 56:27.150
after a long journey down the road.

56:27.200 --> 56:29.150
Leading to Thailand.

56:29.200 --> 56:32.430
I went through all the
usual detox programmes --

56:32.480 --> 56:35.070
grubby hospital wards and grey rooms.

56:35.120 --> 56:40.030
I realised I'd have to travel
further afield to find my serenity.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.910
I have been sober for three years.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.190
Congratulations.

56:44.240 --> 56:48.470
Now that you have reconnected with
your daughter, what are your plans?

56:48.520 --> 56:51.950
Obviously, what happened to Cleo
has put things into perspective.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.910
Obviously.

56:53.960 --> 56:57.150
I'd like to take Tegan
back to Thailand with me.

56:57.200 --> 57:02.350
- How does Tegan feel about this?
- I haven't broached the subject yet.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.110
It's all about timing.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.550
It is, Mr Judd.

57:06.600 --> 57:12.470
Just one more thing -- were you
aware of your ex-wife's allergies?

57:12.520 --> 57:14.000
No.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.550
What a terrible way to die.

58:19.900 --> 58:22.170
There you go, get it all on.

58:22.220 --> 58:23.700
John!

58:27.300 --> 58:29.930
See you later, baby.

58:29.980 --> 58:31.810
I'll get my jacket.

58:31.860 --> 58:32.890
Bye.

58:32.940 --> 58:36.450
Sarah was just speaking to
Kam. She's having a great time.

58:36.500 --> 58:39.450
She probably won't want to come home.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.570
That's not exactly what she said.

58:41.620 --> 58:43.690
She said she's learning
a lot on the course

58:43.740 --> 58:45.370
but she's bored in the evenings.

58:45.420 --> 58:48.130
Ah. That's a shame.

58:48.180 --> 58:50.810
Did she, erm... say anything else?

58:50.860 --> 58:54.260
- About what?
- OK! Let's go.

58:56.540 --> 59:01.010
Oh, I almost forgot -- she
asked how you were doing.

59:01.060 --> 59:03.820
I think Bernie needs rescuing.

59:04.900 --> 59:06.850
Oh, Betty, no!

59:06.900 --> 59:08.900
Paddy.

59:11.140 --> 59:13.850
The scissors tested
positive for blood residue.

59:13.900 --> 59:15.690
I think we have our murder weapon.

59:15.740 --> 59:18.570
Well done. Any thoughts on
the engraving on the blade?

59:18.620 --> 59:23.410
18th July 2012. Certainly isn't
any of our suspects' birthdays.

59:23.460 --> 59:26.010
- Wedding anniversary?
- Maybe.

59:26.060 --> 59:28.530
Any news on Cleo's final house showing,

59:28.580 --> 59:30.930
are we any nearer to finding
the elusive Mr Lewis?

59:30.980 --> 59:32.530
We're drawing a blank so far.

59:32.580 --> 59:35.530
The phone number and address
given for the viewing were false.

59:35.580 --> 59:37.690
We'll keep looking into it.

59:37.740 --> 59:41.530
Can all exhibitors make
their way to the show tent?

59:41.580 --> 59:44.770
Judging will commence shortly.

59:44.820 --> 59:47.010
Hey.

59:47.060 --> 59:49.810
I've been looking for you.

59:49.860 --> 59:53.020
- How are you doing?
- I wish I was a rabbit...

59:54.220 --> 59:59.170
.. not a care in the world, primped
and pampered and fussed over.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:04.450
Well, I could give you a comb-out if
you like, trim your nails for you.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.250
I knew you'd cheer me up.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.290
That's what I'm here for.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.130
Do you think Shorouk is in
with a chance this year?

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.290
I hope so. Dad needs a win.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.740
With Hercules out of the competition.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:25.410
I know you'd do anything for
your dad, but you didn't...

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.290
What?

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.650
Hercules.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.450
No!

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.970
- Sorry. No, I'm sorry.
- No!

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.300
'Course not.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.250
Can you forgive me?

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.780
Always.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.290
They're grooming scissors.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.650
I've sold dozens of pairs over the years,

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.330
but I couldn't tell one pair from another.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.050
Even if they were engraved?

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.610
- Engraved with what?
- A date.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.100
18th July 2012.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.610
Does that mean anything to you?

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.740
I can't say it rings any bells. Sorry.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.980
Thank you, Mrs Benson.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.170
All right, Oliver?

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.410
He's had a result on the rabbit fur.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.210
Good luck to all of today's competitors.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.770
Make sure you've signed
in at the reception tent.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.740
Hi. I wondered if we could have a talk.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.970
How are you feeling?

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.530
- How do you think?
- Sorry. Stupid question.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.090
- I'm not very good at this.
- No, you're not.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.340
OK. I have to go back to Thailand.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.970
Fine. I've managed without
you before, I'll manage again.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.810
I want you to come with me.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.850
Why would I do that?

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.490
Why wouldn't you?

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.530
Because I have a life here, a job.

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.490
Think about it, Tegan.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.890
How long can you fetch and carry
for her, run this silly pet show?

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.410
I know you've lost your boyfriend.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:12.010
- You lost your mother.
- You think you can replace them?

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.290
I never said that. I just...

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.410
I am so sorry I wasn't there for you.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.010
I came back to offer you a better life.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.330
Really? Because everything was fine.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:30.650
I had my boyfriend, I had my mum, I
had my job running a silly pet show,

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.170
and then you turned up.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.890
I know it seems like that.

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:39.860
Why would going to Thailand with
you make anything better for me?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.890
Congratulations to Sprinkles.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.650
Looking good.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.650
- She is.
- Beautiful coat.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.730
She's a French Lop, isn't she?

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.210
That's right! I didn't think
you were an enthusiast.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.050
A recent interest.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.410
Fur from a French Lop was
found in Cleo Langton's car.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.450
It's what caused her death.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.570
- It couldn't have been Lizzie's fur.
- We checked the other entries.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.930
The only rabbit that matches
that description is Lizzie.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.890
- Does she seem to have
any fur missing? - No!

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.090
Apart from you and Tegan,
does anyone have access to her?

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.370
Everybody who comes to the house.
She's anybody's for a cherry tomato.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.250
Thank goodness she can't understand.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:27.140
If she thought for one second she
was implicated in a murder...

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.970
Yes, thank goodness.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.650
Would you say you and Tegan are close?

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.490
She started out as an
employee but now she's family.

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.930
Like a daughter, perhaps?

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.570
I like to think so.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.970
Was there any tension
between yourself and Cleo

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.210
over your relationship with Tegan?

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.370
No, not really. We both had
Tegan's best interests at heart.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.690
But did Cleo have your
best interests at heart?

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.890
She did try to make you sell the Hall.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.410
But she did not succeed.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:04.010
My ownership of Bellville Hall
has never been in question.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.690
Now if you don't mind,
the judging is under way.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.210
Just a little more of your time.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:13.570
18th July 2012 -- does that
date mean anything to you?

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.170
Yes. The pet show is
usually around that time.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.450
Any other significance?

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.770
If I remember correctly,
it was Hercules' first show.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.810
He was a winner from the very start.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.780
Now gentlemen, if you will excuse me.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.090
How much are you willing to bet
that Timothy Benson wanted something

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.810
to remember his first big
win with Hercules by?

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.890
Oh, a great deal.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.060
Hello, Lizzie! Hello, Lizzie.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.810
Silver is on the first
jump, the second jump.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.370
He's done it!

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.530
We need to talk.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.490
I've got nothing more to say to you.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.530
Why don't you have a
chat with Jayesh Varma?

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.930
- That's not important now.
- Oh, isn't it? Does he know?

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:34.570
Timothy, for once in your
life, will you just listen?

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.570
I know what you've done.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.610
- What?
- It's OK, we can sort it out

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.490
if we can get our stories straight.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.490
I bet you're good at that.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.730
- I am trying to help!
- I don't need your help!

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:50.770
The winner of the final
steeplechase is Socrates.

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.850
Yes, those are mine.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.450
- When did you last see them?
- A couple of days ago.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.010
I left them in the marquee,

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:03.210
but with Hercules gone missing,
I'd forgotten about them.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.220
And the engraving?

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.370
They were a gift from my wife

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.210
to celebrate my first
Best in Show victory.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.450
A reminder of a time when
she gave a damn about me.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.410
You're very welcome to keep them.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.930
I can assure you that we will.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.850
How's the temperature?

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.370
I spoke to Jayesh.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.250
I know there's nothing wrong
with the air-conditioning unit.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.650
I just want you to tell
me what you've been up to.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.250
It was supposed to be a surprise.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.340
I think we've had enough of those
to last a lifetime, don't you?

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.170
I know how much you love having
animals to stay in the hotel

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.130
during the pet show.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.770
And I know how much you hate them.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.650
It's not the animals I hate,
it's cleaning up after them.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.050
I know you love to see
the animals run free,

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.690
so I thought we could compromise.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.330
We could advertise ourselves
as a pet-friendly hotel

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:08.410
throughout the entire
year. What do you think?

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.850
I love it!

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.010
I just don't understand why
you had to keep it secret.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.450
Because you have never trusted me
with anything to do with the hotel.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.970
If I've changed anything other than
sheets, you've run it past Cleo.

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.770
- That's not fair.
- Really?

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.410
If I'd told you this idea,
you wouldn't have waited

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.050
for her approval before
giving me the go-ahead?

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.610
I just knew I could always rely on her.

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:36.060
Well, from now on,
you'll have to rely on me.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:44.050
- She looks happy.
- She does, doesn't she?

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.050
I wish I didn't have to be
the one to spoil it for her.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.690
It's the marquee company.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.330
They're threatening to take the thing down

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.050
whilst the show's still on.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.610
They can't do that!

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.770
Let them. It's the least
of Delphi's worries.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:03.050
It's keeping the Hall open
that's the real problem.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:06.650
The concrete for the oil
tank is turning up today,

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.970
but I've had to pay for
it with my own money.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:13.010
- You shouldn't have to do that!
- No, I shouldn't.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.810
Maybe I'll take my dad up on his offer.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:19.649
A few weeks in Thailand
sounds pretty good about now.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.240
A few months sounds even better.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.210
Congratulations.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.050
Thank you. We're positively thrilled.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.529
Someone's getting extra tomatoes tonight.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.689
Shray, could you give us a moment?

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.130
Of course. I'll see how Dad's getting on.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.810
- What is it, dear?
- I've been going through the figures,

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:45.330
and without the sponsorship
money, we're in serious trouble --

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.490
you're in serious trouble.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.810
Even if you persuade the publisher
to go ahead with the new book,

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:55.250
my mum was right, you're going
to have to sell the Hall.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.490
- No. No, no.
- I can help.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:02.250
We can find you a nice little
cottage with a garden for Lizzie.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.010
What about you?

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.850
I'll be fine. Maybe I'll
go to Thailand with my dad.

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:11.210
No, there's no need for that.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.330
I have a way. Come on.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.170
It's been my guilty secret for years.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.250
I come down here whenever
I need a moment to myself.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.729
I find them so calming. It's
because they were my mother's.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:29.090
Oh, she was so glamorous, so chic!

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.569
These days, they're quite beyond the pale,

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.330
but I couldn't bear to part
with them so I keep them here.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.420
But now I understand they might
be worth a great deal of money.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.290
They've gone!

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.340
Someone's taken them.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.290
My mother's furs!

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.260
Who would do something like this?

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.650
And you'd had the furs valued?

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.250
Some of the furs were vintage pieces

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.370
worth a couple of thousand
pounds, maybe more.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.610
They're very delicate.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.370
They need to be kept somewhere
cold so they don't shed.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.250
I do hope whoever took them knows that.

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.170
The door hasn't been
forced. Someone had a key.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.530
There's only one key. I have it
here. I keep it in my desk drawer.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.130
Is that drawer locked?

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.170
- No.
- Miss Hartley,

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.890
your home has been open to the
public for the last few days.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.890
Have you seen anyone
hanging around back here?

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.530
Perhaps they saw you
coming out of the cellar.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.570
- Oh!
- Miss Hartley?

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:44.410
I'm so sorry, Tegan, but your father...

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:49.010
No, you're right, he WAS back
here, and he's been in the house.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.850
It's a serious accusation
to make against your father.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:56.850
Earlier today, he asked me
to come with him to Thailand.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.850
He said there was nothing
left for me here.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.580
That's simply not true. Is it?

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.540
And where is your father now?

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.300
Hello?

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.730
Belinda?

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.260
Perry!

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.490
Hello, old chap.

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.530
Now then.

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.180
Have you got enough food in there?

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.220
Who's that?

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.650
All right, get out.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.130
- I wouldn't put your hands
on me if I were you. - Out!

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.810
- I'm warning you!
- I'm warning YOU.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.690
Keep your nose out of my business.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.490
- What are you trying to hide?
- What's he talking about?

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.530
Nothing, if he knows what's good for him.

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:15.690
You have no idea who you're
messing with, understand?

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.970
- You'd better leave.
- Yeah?

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:21.420
- He needs help.
- Yes, that's true. But still.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:26.290
Dad, what were you thinking? He's a guest.

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.880
- Well, I...
- Dad! Talk to me.

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.850
- What on earth is...
- Urgh!

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.380
Dad!

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.730
We need to speak to
Errol Judd. Is he here?

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.980
- I haven't seen him.
- Which room is he in?

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:52.340
His luggage is still here.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.360
Check the wardrobe.

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.250
Can you open this?

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.640
Yeah, there's a master code.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.380
Thank you.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:11.170
Some Thai currency, driving
licence, his passport

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.610
and two boarding passes.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:18.050
- Two? - One in his name and one
in the name of Tegan Langton.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.810
- Is she leaving with him?
- Looks like it.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.690
Hang on -- driving licence? I
thought he was disqualified.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.900
He is. Apparently, Michael Lewis is not.

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.650
Mr Lewis.

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.530
That's who Cleo Langton had her
Rose Cottage appointment with.

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.170
Perry?

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.970
Oh, Perry. I think Dad
has finally flipped.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.410
And what makes you say that?

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.760
He was fighting by the
sheds with Errol Judd.

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.740
Hercules!

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.650
Did Errol Judd leave with your father?

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.410
No, before him. I don't
know where he was going.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.650
Your father might. Any
idea where we'll find him?

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.300
I don't know. I don't
know anything any more.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.180
Thank you.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:11.890
In the Syrian hamster class, the
judges were particularly impressed

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:15.730
by the winner's clear
markings, good proportions

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.050
and a winning personality.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.250
And the winner is Xena Warrior Princess.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.810
Well done, Gracie!

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.700
That's lovely. Smile. Thank you.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:41.050
- Well done.
- And now for the final prize.

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.410
But first, I would like to take a moment

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:47.730
to thank you all for coming each year.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.980
It's meant so much to me.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:56.900
And also thank the one person without
whom this show would not happen...

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.130
.. Tegan.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:04.260
I do hope she knows how
important she is to the show...

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.180
.. and to me.

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:14.170
And now for the moment we
have all been waiting for --

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.490
the prize for Best in Show.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.330
So...

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:21.690
Oh!

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.730
The winner is Shorouk,

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.180
owner, Dhruv Varma.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.980
Lovely!

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:40.810
That's amazing! I can't
believe it. Thank you.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.420
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.940
Thank you, thank you.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.290
And one more.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.050
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.290
Thank you, but he's
done all the hard work.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.410
Where's Shray? He'll be over the moon.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:04.810
He's been a bag of nerves all
week. He thinks the world of you.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:10.100
Oh, yeah? Well, I know there's
someone who he thinks more of.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.450
Ah, Mr Benson.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:35.380
We just met the famous Hercules.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.850
It's not what you think.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.890
I think we should discuss your
whereabouts on the night Seb died.

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:48.050
- Perhaps you should put the box down.
- No, no! I'm fine.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.170
How long have you been back there?

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:59.450
Long enough. Oh, Tim, what have you done?

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.650
You're the one who's been
skulking round with the builder!

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.210
Mrs Benson, what exactly is it
you think your husband has done?

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.730
Isn't it obvious?

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.930
The scissors, the lies
-- he killed Seb and Cleo.

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.650
I did what?

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.770
And I drove him to it.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.690
When I told you it was me or the rabbit,

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.680
you weren't supposed to choose Hercules.

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.980
Is that him?

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.730
Perhaps you'd care to join us.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.730
I knew it!

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:41.970
Tim, I just wanted to hurt
you like you'd hurt me.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:44.170
He's nothing to me.

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.890
All right, love! I just wanted
you for your chest freezer.

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.530
What? What does that even mean?

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.650
And for your information,
I didn't kill anyone!

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:56.010
- How could you even think that?
- You've been acting so strangely,

01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:00.290
and it's been going on for weeks
-- the drinking, the skulking about.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.130
- Belinda's been worried too.
- That wasn't why...

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.250
Oh, for goodness sake!

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.410
Mr Benson?

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.010
In a matter of weeks, I'd
lost everything -- my wife,

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.060
my home, my pride...

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.490
.. and then on top of all that,

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:23.460
I lost the one thing that
could still make me happy.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:30.570
It happened the day after we had the row,

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.890
the day after I walked out.

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:37.370
I went to his hutch, and he was just...

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.890
And the rabbit that was
taken from the show?

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:44.410
A last-minute replacement
and a pale imitation.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:49.450
I'd already taken the stud fees. I
just needed a rabbit who could...

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.970
.. perform.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:56.130
But then I got greedy. I thought
I could pass him off at the show.

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.810
But Hercules was a celebrity rabbit.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.370
People wanted a closer
look, photographs, even.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.850
I just wanted to be part of it,

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.770
the few days in the year when
people treated me with respect,

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.770
actually cared about what I had to say.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.810
Oh, Tim!

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.050
I felt sure Cleo had worked it out.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.890
I had to find a way of
withdrawing from the competition

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.730
without raising suspicion,

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:27.210
so I decided that Hercules
Two needed to disappear.

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.890
And that's when you killed Seb!

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.210
What? No! Why do you keep saying that?

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.890
One other question --

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.380
did either of you have access
to Delphi Hartley's cellar?

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.850
Hm.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.380
I'll check the freezer.

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.260
Ailsa, what have you done?

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:03.330
I'm sorry, Tim. I was just
trying to keep the shop going.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.380
Can you forgive me?

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.890
We'll have to see.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.090
So Timothy was the rabbitnapper,

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.650
Ailsa and Jayesh are the fur
thieves, so where's Errol Judd?

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.530
Not on his way back to Thailand,
not without his passport.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.970
- Or his daughter.
- You think this is about Tegan,

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.050
someone cutting her ties to Midsomer
-- her boyfriend, her mother.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.860
Or is someone trying very
hard to keep her close?

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.130
Whoa!

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.780
Next entrance, not this one.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.770
Tegan.

01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.050
Delphi!

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.540
Is that the new book?

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.090
Why?

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.410
I've written over 30 books,

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:13.010
and some would say I have
written the same book 30 times.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:16.130
I like my stories and my characters,

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.050
but if nobody wants my books any more,

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.700
what's the point in writing them?

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.370
I'm going to sell the Hall.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.220
I think it's a good idea.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.900
I am going to need you more than
ever. Please don't go to Thailand.

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:42.610
No, I won't. I'll stay here for you.

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.090
And there's someone else I'm staying for.

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.010
Bless you.

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:04.580
Check the house and
grounds. I'll check the show.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:11.610
- Can I help you?
- Are you OK?

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.690
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Do you know where your father is?

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.220
No.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.420
Sir, you need to get round
to the back of the Hall.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.650
Stop!

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.810
- Shray! - Come any closer
and I'll press the button.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.730
You need to let Tegan's father go, Shray.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.330
Stop this before it gets worse for you.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:07.010
- Dad!
- Tegan, no.

01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.650
Please don't hurt him!

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.690
Why not?

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.330
He hurt you. He left you!

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.850
Shray, please. You're scaring me.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:21.090
He doesn't care about
you, Tegan, not like I do.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:23.210
He just wants to take you away.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:28.860
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying
here, with Delphi, with you.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.140
I was going to talk to you,
tell you how I really felt.

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:49.730
Remember your birthday? I took
you to our favourite place.

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.930
The picnic, I remember.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:53.530
It was perfect,

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.490
the perfect place, the perfect
time to finally say it,

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.850
and then Seb called you and
you told him to join us!

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.650
I... I didn't realise.

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:06.340
No, it's OK. Because then
I knew what I had to do.

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:11.050
I just needed to get the moment back,

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.210
but I couldn't do that
while Seb was around.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.850
Son! What did you...

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.050
You couldn't see what he was really like,

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.290
the way he used people
to get what he wanted.

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.330
He lied all the time.

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:26.810
Then you caught him in the marquee,
ruining all Tegan's hard work.

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.810
He didn't care about what he'd done.

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.610
He just wanted the sale,

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.050
then he was going to leave
and take you with him.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.490
If only Timothy Benson hadn't
left those scissors lying around.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:42.330
There would have been a lot of blood,
but you had somewhere to clean up --

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.610
Rose Cottage.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.410
You still had the keys the next
morning, until Cleo took them.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.460
You killed my mum?

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.050
I couldn't be sure about what she'd found.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.570
I couldn't take that risk.

01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.930
I tried to make it look like an accident,

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.170
to make this as easy on you as I could.

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:05.090
- Easy?
- She was lying to you, Tegan!

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:09.410
All those years, about
your dad, a liar, like Seb.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:12.810
I'm not like them. I'd
never do that to you.

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:16.970
I trusted you. I thought
you were my best friend.

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.290
Maybe there could have
been a future between us.

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.850
There still can.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.450
Tegan, Tegan!

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.640
- Dad!
- Shray, enough!

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.580
Dad! Dad.

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.770
Shray Varma, I'm arresting you
for the murders of Seb Huntington,

01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.530
Cleo Langton and the attempted
murder of Errol Judd.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.410
Dad, Dad!

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.810
I'm sorry I've let you down, son.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:04.010
- You didn't.
- I must have.

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:07.980
Look at you. Look at what you've done!

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:25.010
If only he'd got his perfect moment.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.530
If he was too scared of rejection
to tell Tegan how he really felt,

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.580
maybe he didn't deserve her after all.

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.640
Faint heart never won fair maid.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.290
That's it. Oh!

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.930
Oh, that's a bit tricky.

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:46.730
You try and do that one.

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.780
Who's that?

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:56.530
Come here. Come go see Dad. There we go.

01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:00.050
Come on, we've got to get this
back to the station in an hour.

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.370
Let's get this photo taken.

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.250
Come here.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.650
There we go -- one for you.

01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:09.250
Oh.

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.240
And one for Bernie.

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:15.170
- Come here, Paddy.
- Look at the lady.

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.960
- Over there, look.
- Say 'cheese'.

01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.810
Not my face!
