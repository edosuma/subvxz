04:41.581 --> 04:43.559
Wish I had a pair of kicks
like that when I was growing up.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.752
You grew up here?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.120
Yeah, something like that.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.989
Do you know Sam?

04:48.022 --> 04:49.991
- Sam?
- She's my best friend.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.491
I'm looking for her.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.961
Hey, do you know anyone
named Sam?

04:54.561 --> 04:55.595
No.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.597
Sorry, man.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.166
It's okay.

04:59.934 --> 05:00.935
Thanks.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.506
Hey, you...
You gotta pay for that, boss.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.042
I do?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.182
Then the other one.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.284
Give me a second.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.887
Can I help you?

05:54.889 --> 05:56.023
Let me call you back.

06:00.828 --> 06:01.996
Can I help you?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.931
- Is it true?
- What?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.200
You still have the best
pancakes in the universe?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.971
Well, sure. You hungry?

06:11.005 --> 06:12.639
Have a seat, wherever you want.

06:20.014 --> 06:21.681
This is where we used to sit.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.985
Cool.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.892
Me, too.

06:31.926 --> 06:33.626
Exclamation point.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.694
Looking forward to it.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.063
Winky face emoji.

06:42.103 --> 06:44.681
- What are you doing?
- Talking to my girl. You can't be back here.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.183
- Is she in there?
- No, I'm serious. Back off.

06:46.207 --> 06:47.274
Stop playing.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.350
I'm sorry for yelling.

06:59.053 --> 07:00.620
You said pancakes, right?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.094
Well, it's closing time, so...

07:07.128 --> 07:10.697
I'm not saying you gotta go
home, but you gotta...

07:14.301 --> 07:15.421
You'll be back for pancakes?

07:17.738 --> 07:20.141
- My name is junior.
- Mmm.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.375
Tell me your name again.

07:23.911 --> 07:24.945
Thorp.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.321
You with the senior league?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.459
They're here for another hour.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.797
But I've got an open Lane for
you right there, if you're alone.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.165
You're alone, aren't ya?

08:18.732 --> 08:20.868
I'm here to find Sam.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.137
Oh. Uh, what does he look like?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.472
Sam's a girl.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.409
Well, then what does
she look like?

08:28.442 --> 08:32.179
She's got hair, and eyes, and...

08:32.213 --> 08:33.380
She's my best friend.

08:33.414 --> 08:35.883
Well, that's specific.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.752
When was the last time
you were here?

08:38.786 --> 08:41.222
Oh, about 25 years ago.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.391
You're funny.

08:44.425 --> 08:45.859
I like you.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.795
I like you.

08:49.964 --> 08:52.466
Well, I don't know
any Sam around here,

08:52.499 --> 08:54.201
but I'll keep my eyes open.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.104
If you like,

08:57.137 --> 08:59.840
I can give you
a private lesson later.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.176
Give you some special attention.

09:02.209 --> 09:06.113
Thanks, but I used to go bowling
with Sam all the time.

09:06.814 --> 09:07.848
Okay.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.017
If you change your mind,
let me know.

09:11.452 --> 09:13.254
Oh, wanna throw one?

09:14.321 --> 09:16.390
- Really?
- You're already here.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.392
Throwback Thursdays.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.426
Two bucks a game.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.231
Ooh. Big one.

09:24.265 --> 09:27.201
Twelve, 13? Hmm.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.439
Thanks.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.844
Sweet boy. Here you go.

11:28.956 --> 11:29.990
Sam?

12:46.500 --> 12:49.169
Lily. Hey, Lily. Watch this.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.210
You go, girl.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.116
Do you know Sam?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.219
No. What are you doing?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.155
Can I play, too?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.190
I'm not allowed
to play with strangers.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.327
My dad said I'll get
kidnapped or murdered.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.266
Have you ever kidnapped anyone?

13:20.702 --> 13:22.636
Have you ever murdered anyone?

13:25.539 --> 13:27.541
Lily, is it okay if I play
with this stranger?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.811
So what if he did not
like that photo?

13:29.844 --> 13:31.578
You go, girl.

13:31.612 --> 13:33.213
Okay, you go ahead then.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.428
We go under on three.

13:48.462 --> 13:51.298
One, two, three.

13:58.372 --> 14:00.674
I won. Yes, yes, yes!

14:01.441 --> 14:02.442
Wanna play again?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.589
Did you really see a shark?

14:16.791 --> 14:18.325
Next one wins, okay?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.597
Do you have money?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.412
Do you want some ice cream?

14:29.136 --> 14:31.271
Outer space? Really?

14:32.606 --> 14:34.274
So, you are an alien?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.343
I'm a thorp.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.881
I'm not saying I believe you,

14:39.914 --> 14:43.350
but if you are a thorp,
why'd you come back here?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.186
I had to find Sam.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.554
She's my best friend.

14:47.922 --> 14:49.891
What happened?

14:49.924 --> 14:52.192
I had to leave really quickly,

14:52.225 --> 14:54.695
and I never got to say goodbye.

14:54.729 --> 14:57.230
We just moved into
the house over there.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.699
I don't have any friends yet.

14:59.533 --> 15:00.667
Hmm.

15:01.836 --> 15:04.404
Can't you make some new ones?

15:04.438 --> 15:07.207
All the kids at my school
don't care about anyone else.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.410
They just care about
their stupid iPads and iPhones.

15:10.912 --> 15:12.847
What's an iPhones?

15:12.880 --> 15:16.550
My dad says, "if you want
to connect with kids your age",

15:16.583 --> 15:19.386
"you have to disconnect
from technology first."

15:19.419 --> 15:21.856
How? They won't even talk to me.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.358
Mmm.

15:27.929 --> 15:29.764
You go, girl.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.870
We should probably be friends now.

15:36.971 --> 15:38.006
What are you doing?

15:38.039 --> 15:40.273
- You scared the shit out of me.
- This is thorp.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.541
We are leaving now!

15:41.575 --> 15:43.443
Wait. He was gone
for a long time, and...

15:43.477 --> 15:45.913
Olivia Walters,
you go stand over there, okay?

15:45.947 --> 15:46.814
Okay.

15:46.848 --> 15:49.650
- Bye, Olivia.
- You come near her again,

15:49.683 --> 15:51.351
I will shove that
so far up your ass,

15:51.385 --> 15:52.665
you'll be tasting it for a week.

16:15.777 --> 16:17.177
Get out of here.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.914
Get out of here.

16:21.515 --> 16:22.717
Can you believe this?

16:22.750 --> 16:24.584
I'm live-streaming this.

16:24.618 --> 16:27.354
This is some
misogynistic bullshit.

16:30.825 --> 16:32.292
I can't believe this.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.362
Oh, what the... oh!

16:57.785 --> 16:59.153
<i>And now, a local video</i>

16:59.187 --> 17:02.957

17:02.990 --> 17:05.760

17:05.793 --> 17:08.495
<i>This is some
misogynistic bullshit.</i>

17:10.031 --> 17:11.231
<i>Oh.</i>

17:54.776 --> 17:56.744
"For an old friend."

18:12.827 --> 18:14.762
"Welcome home, thorp."

18:17.832 --> 18:18.900
That's me.

18:21.068 --> 18:22.469
"I know your secret."

18:23.004 --> 18:24.604
"You're going to die."

20:21.222 --> 20:25.458

20:52.053 --> 20:53.788
I can't believe you're back.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.890
They're the best pancakes
in the universe.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.091
I had to come back.

20:57.725 --> 20:59.659
I'm just teasing.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.972
I just figured, with all the
attention you got from that video,

21:01.996 --> 21:04.065
you'd have a girlfriend by now.

21:04.098 --> 21:05.532
Even with that mullet.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.599
Video?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.601
It's all over social media, bro.

21:09.971 --> 21:11.872
You're viral.

21:11.906 --> 21:14.241
<i>- This?
- I'm live-streaming this.</i>

21:14.275 --> 21:15.943
<i>This is some misogynistic...</i>

21:15.977 --> 21:17.111
The TV, too?

21:20.547 --> 21:21.716

21:21.749 --> 21:22.984
- That's me.
<i>- What the...</i>

21:24.285 --> 21:25.618
Hilarious, right?

21:27.888 --> 21:28.723
Do it.

21:28.756 --> 21:30.725
What's your name? I'm Katie.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.960
Thorp.

21:32.994 --> 21:35.096
Do you want to hang out with us?
Have a beer?

21:35.129 --> 21:37.530
That's nice. I have to find Sam.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.501
Bye, thorp.

21:43.037 --> 21:44.671
We should've
asked for his number.

21:44.705 --> 21:46.273
Shut up. He's too old.

21:46.307 --> 21:47.674
You see that tattoo, though?

21:47.708 --> 21:49.710
- Yeah.
- And the creepy mustache?

21:51.879 --> 21:54.949
Aw, I miss you, too.

21:58.786 --> 22:00.721
Hmm.

22:03.357 --> 22:05.692
You want to help me
find Sam today?

22:05.726 --> 22:08.162
Uh, I'd like to, I would,

22:08.195 --> 22:10.831
but I got a date
with my girl, online.

22:10.865 --> 22:13.300
But maybe when I
meet her for real, in person?

22:13.334 --> 22:14.802
She can introduce you
to a friend.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.603
Hmm? We'll make it a double.

22:18.939 --> 22:19.974
Double what?

22:22.743 --> 22:23.944
You're a funny guy.

23:06.987 --> 23:09.957
I told you to knock three times.

23:11.025 --> 23:12.193
Oh.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.061
Did you bring me ice cream?

23:15.963 --> 23:17.031
Come on in.

23:20.334 --> 23:21.802
I'd call the police.

23:21.836 --> 23:23.904
But it's probably
not a good idea,

23:23.938 --> 23:26.874
- since you're a thorp.
- Hmm.

23:26.907 --> 23:28.709
Maybe you should just hide.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.111
I can't hide.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.979
I have to find Sam.

23:32.012 --> 23:33.848
What else did you guys
use to do?

23:35.648 --> 23:40.254
Her dad had a boat,
so we would go to a secret island

23:40.287 --> 23:42.022
and Bury treasure.

23:42.056 --> 23:43.290
You guys buried treasure?

23:43.324 --> 23:46.127
Yeah. Letters and toys.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.229
And... treasure.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.264
Do you think they're still
buried out there?

23:51.365 --> 23:52.632
I don't know.

23:55.269 --> 23:58.072
Maybe she moved away.
Have you tried to Google her?

23:58.973 --> 24:00.774
What's a "Google her?"

24:00.808 --> 24:02.343
"What's a 'Google her?'"

25:16.116 --> 25:17.151
Are you Sam?

25:26.961 --> 25:28.095
Have you seen Sam?

26:19.113 --> 26:20.114
Huh?

26:22.116 --> 26:23.183
Sam!

26:54.281 --> 26:55.849
I can't hear your heart.

26:59.486 --> 27:02.489
Yo, dude,
your boat's floating away!

29:12.653 --> 29:14.521
I can't come in here anymore.

29:14.555 --> 29:16.715
This your way of telling me
you don't like my pancakes?

29:17.491 --> 29:18.592
I love your pancakes.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.527
You cheating on me
with another diner?

29:20.561 --> 29:22.196
I don't know any other diners.

29:22.229 --> 29:24.131
You going paleo?

29:24.164 --> 29:25.399
What's a "paleo?"

29:27.769 --> 29:29.169
What's up?

29:29.203 --> 29:31.238
Why are you not
coming in no more?

29:31.271 --> 29:34.575
My friend, Olivia, she's eight.
I buy her ice cream.

29:34.608 --> 29:37.478
- And I bought a boat. And I go bowling.
- Hmm.

29:37.511 --> 29:40.347
But I'm out of money now.
So, no more pancakes.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.325
How were you getting your money
in the first place?

29:42.349 --> 29:44.318
From my parents' storage unit.

29:44.351 --> 29:47.621
Ah, one of those
trust fund babies.

29:47.654 --> 29:50.758
Well, if you stay here,
you're gonna need to get a job.

29:50.792 --> 29:52.292
I've never had a job.

29:52.326 --> 29:55.095
So, why don't you get one?

29:56.396 --> 29:57.397
Feel me?

30:00.768 --> 30:02.002
I do.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.087
You can't leave already.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.522
I can't find Sam.

30:21.555 --> 30:23.257
But you just got here.

30:39.106 --> 30:41.508
We need to go on a hunt.
To find Sam.

30:44.111 --> 30:46.113
Someone's hunting me, though.

30:46.146 --> 30:47.347
I don't think it's real.

30:47.381 --> 30:49.049
It's probably just a joke.

30:50.384 --> 30:51.385
Hmm.

30:58.425 --> 31:01.261
<i>Thorpy, thorpy,
open up the tunnel!</i>

31:01.295 --> 31:02.529
Choo, choo!

32:25.747 --> 32:27.915
Sure I can help you...

32:27.949 --> 32:29.851
But you gotta help me, too.

32:29.884 --> 32:31.919
I like helping.

32:31.953 --> 32:34.521
I know this is gonna
sound strange,

32:34.554 --> 32:39.727
but... would you mind
coming back later tonight

32:39.761 --> 32:42.262
after everybody's gone?

32:43.798 --> 32:45.432
Okay.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.902
No, no. Don't, come back.

32:47.935 --> 32:50.404
I... I meant...

32:50.437 --> 32:53.440
I meant I can make
your phone calls now...

32:54.541 --> 32:57.611
But I'd just like you
to come back later tonight.

32:59.546 --> 33:02.249
- Do you like Chinese?
- I do.

33:02.282 --> 33:06.821
Alaska, remind me to
order takeout at 7:00 P.M.

33:06.854 --> 33:09.724
<i>Take out set for 7:00 P.M.</i>

33:09.757 --> 33:12.659
Oh, my son got her for me.

33:12.693 --> 33:16.596
She's really a big help,
but she's not a hugger.

33:17.631 --> 33:19.366
Okay, let's make your calls.

33:25.940 --> 33:26.941
Thorp.

33:39.721 --> 33:42.556
Yeah... yeah, just tell peaches
to come after firefox.

33:42.589 --> 33:44.558
Uh, in about an hour or so.

33:44.591 --> 33:46.460
Hey, uh, let me call you back
in a minute.

33:46.493 --> 33:47.962
All right.

33:47.995 --> 33:49.463
What's up, man? Can I help you?

33:58.706 --> 33:59.707
You can dance?

34:01.541 --> 34:03.643
Thanks for coming in.

34:03.677 --> 34:07.314
I'm Meg bedonavich.
Everyone calls me Meg begs.

34:07.347 --> 34:09.449
You have a nice voice, Meg begs.

34:09.884 --> 34:11.018
Hmm.

34:11.052 --> 34:13.653
You look like a movie star.

34:13.687 --> 34:15.723
Well, don't you just know
the way to my heart?

34:17.491 --> 34:18.592
So, what's your name?

34:19.459 --> 34:21.796
Thorp.

34:23.765 --> 34:25.475
You're not gonna make any money
with a name like that.

34:25.499 --> 34:26.868
What's your... your stage name?

34:26.901 --> 34:28.035
Stage name?

34:28.069 --> 34:31.671
- I was bowling the other day...
- Ugh, I love bowling.

34:31.706 --> 34:33.975
Me, too. I was with Tom Selleck.

34:34.008 --> 34:35.375
Oh, my god.

34:35.408 --> 34:38.411
I adore Tom Selleck.

34:38.445 --> 34:42.884
I would watch him bowl, i'd...
I'd watch him read the phonebook.

34:42.917 --> 34:45.853
I'd watch him do anything.

34:46.988 --> 34:48.622
Love Tom Selleck.

34:49.157 --> 34:50.690
I love Tom Selleck, too.

34:55.730 --> 34:57.697
White thunder. White lightning.

34:57.732 --> 35:00.067
White rhino. White chupacabra.

35:00.101 --> 35:01.701
Um, white unicorn.

35:01.736 --> 35:03.971
Do the white thing.
White's all right.

35:04.005 --> 35:05.472
White man can jump.

35:05.505 --> 35:07.440
Uh, white on white,
white on rice.

35:07.474 --> 35:08.910
Uh, rice is white.

35:08.943 --> 35:09.944
Magnum pi.

35:11.112 --> 35:12.345
Oh, shit.

35:12.379 --> 35:14.749
Oh, I like that. I like that!

35:14.782 --> 35:16.449
- You're a private eye.
- Yeah?

35:16.483 --> 35:18.019
You slay the audience
with your, uh...

35:18.052 --> 35:20.054
- With your Magnum moves.
- Hmm.

35:20.087 --> 35:21.454
It's weird...

35:22.957 --> 35:24.424
But I kinda dig it. I dig it.

35:24.457 --> 35:25.625
You dig it?

35:25.659 --> 35:27.859
Yeah, goes with this little
'80s thing you got going on.

35:28.863 --> 35:31.431
I see you like
our founder's trust award.

35:31.464 --> 35:32.666
That's shiny.

35:34.936 --> 35:36.704
What's your handle?

35:37.738 --> 35:39.372
Oh, I'll tag you on insta.

35:39.406 --> 35:40.440
Stand up.

35:41.675 --> 35:42.710
Come on, stand up.

35:44.578 --> 35:45.679
Take your jacket off.

35:54.055 --> 35:55.056
Your pants off.

35:56.623 --> 35:57.859
Come on, don't be shy.

36:07.467 --> 36:09.669
Where did you go to school?

36:09.704 --> 36:12.139
I left when I was eight.
I never went to school.

36:12.173 --> 36:13.506
Huh.

36:16.509 --> 36:19.881
You know, they say
honesty is the best policy,

36:19.914 --> 36:23.751
but that's not always the case...

36:24.252 --> 36:26.120
Mr...

36:27.654 --> 36:28.723
Thorp.

36:31.158 --> 36:32.392
Squat.

36:34.527 --> 36:35.562
Squat.

36:39.033 --> 36:40.034
Right there.

36:46.874 --> 36:48.843
I think we can work with this.

36:48.876 --> 36:50.577
Really?

36:51.611 --> 36:53.781
You'll give me cash fast?

36:53.814 --> 36:56.183
I won't, but other men will.

36:56.217 --> 36:57.550
Hmm.

I'm so sorry your job search
didn't turn out...

38:41.088 --> 38:42.089
People...

38:42.123 --> 38:45.592
People just don't realize
how special you are.

38:46.894 --> 38:48.763
You think I'm special?

38:48.796 --> 38:50.663
Well, of course you're special.

38:51.698 --> 38:53.734
I just wish there was a way that

38:53.768 --> 38:55.302
you could make
some money, but...

38:55.336 --> 38:57.738
Maybe selling something
that you own,

38:57.772 --> 39:02.810
like, um, stocks, bonds. Uh...

39:02.843 --> 39:04.979
No. Okay.

39:05.612 --> 39:07.281
I know!

39:07.314 --> 39:09.183
We're gonna play a game.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.919
It's called
"what does thorp own?"

39:11.952 --> 39:13.954
I like games. How do we play?

39:13.988 --> 39:17.992
You tell me what you own.

39:18.558 --> 39:21.862
Shoes, Tom Selleck, house,

39:21.896 --> 39:24.131
- headband...
- Wait, wait, wait. House?

39:24.165 --> 39:26.033
I can't sell my family's house.

39:26.067 --> 39:28.369
No, no, no.
You don't have to sell it.

39:28.402 --> 39:31.772
Somebody comes in and
lives with you in part of it.

39:31.806 --> 39:33.774
Sam's family used to
live in our house.

39:33.808 --> 39:34.942
Exactly.

39:34.975 --> 39:39.713
Somebody comes in and they
give you money every month.

39:39.747 --> 39:41.681
- Money every month?
- Ah!

39:42.049 --> 39:43.217
<i>Salud.</i>

39:44.351 --> 39:45.652
Salut.

39:45.685 --> 39:47.321

39:47.354 --> 39:48.722
Salut.

39:49.190 --> 39:50.690
- "D."
- "d."

39:50.724 --> 39:52.692
<i>Salud.</i>

39:55.096 --> 39:58.766
A few years ago,
my husband passed.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.902
He was a great guy.

40:03.304 --> 40:05.406
My soulmate.

40:05.439 --> 40:09.609
Wow! Could he dance. Whoa...

40:10.711 --> 40:11.879
I...

40:11.912 --> 40:15.282
I didn't know if I could ever
be intimate with a man again.

40:17.218 --> 40:20.855
And for a while, I didn't...
I didn't think about it.

40:24.024 --> 40:25.860
But it's hard, thorp.

40:29.830 --> 40:31.165
When women age...

40:32.867 --> 40:34.068
They tell us...

40:35.069 --> 40:37.838
Society tells us...

40:37.872 --> 40:41.942
That we're not
a sexual commodity anymore.

40:42.810 --> 40:44.812
Like I give two shits.

40:46.881 --> 40:52.453
But it doesn't mean
I don't have sexual thoughts.

40:52.486 --> 40:54.822
It doesn't mean I don't have...

40:56.090 --> 40:58.926
Desire for certain things.

41:00.761 --> 41:02.263
I'm 74.

41:02.530 --> 41:03.931
So what?

41:05.766 --> 41:10.271
And when I... when I hear
that familiar song...

41:10.304 --> 41:15.142
You know, the kind where
your hips start to sway.

41:20.347 --> 41:21.749
You can't help it.

41:25.085 --> 41:27.922
You gotta move your hips
with a man.

41:30.457 --> 41:34.962
And it doesn't go away
when your soulmate is gone.

41:37.498 --> 41:39.366
It's part of you...

41:41.268 --> 41:42.770
Always.

41:45.439 --> 41:46.840
You know what I mean?

41:51.946 --> 41:53.981
I like talking to you.

41:56.183 --> 41:57.918
I like talking to you, too.

41:57.952 --> 42:00.054
Thanks.

42:01.121 --> 42:05.092
Alaska, play my favorite song.

42:05.125 --> 42:07.828
<i>Playing favorite song.</i>

42:14.501 --> 42:17.271
You wanna dance? Dance with me.

42:18.339 --> 42:20.040
I love dancing.

42:23.344 --> 42:25.379
Not like... not like that.

42:48.002 --> 42:50.137
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

42:52.039 --> 42:53.407
Real nice.

43:05.085 --> 43:06.987
- Tom Selleck.
- What?

43:07.021 --> 43:09.490
I... I have to
feed Tom Selleck. I...

43:18.132 --> 43:19.967
Thorp, wait! Wait, wait.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.535
I got something for you.

43:21.568 --> 43:24.305
It's not much,
but it's enough...

43:24.338 --> 43:25.339
Oh, wait.

43:25.372 --> 43:27.341
It's enough to tide you over

43:27.374 --> 43:30.311
until you get someone
to share the rent with you.

43:39.286 --> 43:40.921
Thank you, pauline.

43:51.899 --> 43:54.301
I have a neighbor
who also likes to dance.

43:54.335 --> 43:56.904
What?

43:58.339 --> 43:59.373
Bye, thorp.

44:02.409 --> 44:04.178
Bye.

44:23.497 --> 44:24.531
Hi.

44:24.565 --> 44:26.433
You, uh, got a menu?

44:28.469 --> 44:30.003
You got a boyfriend?

44:31.672 --> 44:33.607
I'll take a coffee, black.

44:50.725 --> 44:51.959
Do I know you?

44:54.228 --> 44:56.363
From that video!

44:56.397 --> 44:58.599
Dude, you saved
those girls' lives.

44:58.632 --> 45:00.134
Told you you were famous.

45:00.167 --> 45:01.602
Wow.

45:01.635 --> 45:03.003
Those, uh, pancakes any good?

45:06.273 --> 45:09.576
The sign says they're the best
in the universe.

45:09.610 --> 45:10.911
Well, are they?

45:13.380 --> 45:14.515
I'm all ears, thorp.

45:14.783 --> 45:16.116
All ears?

45:16.150 --> 45:19.286
Thorp. Oh, that's right.
What a name.

45:21.989 --> 45:23.357
I'll take what he's having.

45:23.390 --> 45:24.501
Oh, you don't want that.
He gets...

45:24.525 --> 45:25.993
You know what I want now, too?

45:28.529 --> 45:30.531
Triple order, coming up.

45:36.336 --> 45:37.404
You mind if I...

45:41.408 --> 45:43.377
So, do you come here a lot?

45:43.410 --> 45:45.245
Every day.

45:45.279 --> 45:47.214
But I spent all my $2 bills,

45:47.247 --> 45:49.349
so if I don't find someone
to live in my place

45:49.383 --> 45:50.728
- and give me money every month...
- Wait, wait.

45:50.752 --> 45:52.286
Your place is for rent?

45:52.319 --> 45:54.087
Just the bottom floor.

45:54.121 --> 45:57.458
It's... that's too wild. I...

45:58.760 --> 46:01.028
I'm looking for a place to rent.

46:01.061 --> 46:03.464
- You are?
- Yeah.

46:03.497 --> 46:06.099
It's so wild.
I just got into town.

46:06.133 --> 46:09.002
Wow.

46:09.036 --> 46:14.107
You ever meet anybody
and you just feel connected?

46:14.141 --> 46:17.344
Like, we just knew
each other from a different...

46:18.545 --> 46:21.014
A different time,
a different universe.

46:22.149 --> 46:23.150
No.

46:23.785 --> 46:24.985
Yeah.

46:26.587 --> 46:29.724
I'm Rachel.

46:29.757 --> 46:31.058

Holy cow.

48:30.712 --> 48:32.312
I'm okay. I'm okay.

48:33.614 --> 48:35.382
I messed up your box.

48:37.618 --> 48:39.319
Is she gonna be your girlfriend?

48:39.921 --> 48:41.388
I don't think so.

48:41.421 --> 48:43.423
But she's gonna live with you?

48:43.457 --> 48:47.194
If she likes it, she'll give me
money every month.

48:48.495 --> 48:51.766
You're thorp. Can't you just use
your powers to make more money?

48:51.799 --> 48:54.501
I got all the important things.
A baseball bat.

48:54.534 --> 48:56.370
- Do you play?
- Baseball?

48:56.403 --> 48:57.805
- Yeah.
- No.

48:57.839 --> 49:00.207
Sam and I
used to play other games.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.341
Yeah? Like what?

49:01.375 --> 49:06.513
Like, uh, mud monster,
tetherball and secret island.

49:06.546 --> 49:09.717
Oh, my god.
Thorp, you have a secret island?

49:09.751 --> 49:12.252
Yeah. But it's a secret.

49:17.290 --> 49:18.826
I don't like her.

49:18.860 --> 49:20.527
You don't even know her.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.729
Neither do you.

49:23.697 --> 49:26.366
Now I can focus on finding Sam.

49:28.335 --> 49:30.537
I wish you were here
to help me, too.

49:33.373 --> 49:35.308
Okay. Maybe I'll ask Rachel.

49:37.411 --> 49:38.713
Where have you looked?

49:38.746 --> 49:43.583
In the diner, bowling alley,
people's houses, the secret island.

49:43.617 --> 49:46.253
Maybe she's not here anymore.

49:46.286 --> 49:49.489
Maybe she moved away.
Or maybe she's dead.

49:49.523 --> 49:51.759
No. She's close.

49:51.793 --> 49:53.527
I can feel it.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.496
If she's still here,
she's older now. Duh.

49:56.530 --> 49:57.965
She won't be bowling.

49:57.999 --> 49:59.867
What do women your age do?

51:30.124 --> 51:31.458
Can I come in?

51:34.962 --> 51:36.329
I heard you.

51:37.031 --> 51:38.632
- What?
- Thin walls.

51:38.665 --> 51:40.634
- Huh.
- I heard you come home.

51:40.667 --> 51:42.602
You must have been
talking to this guy.

51:42.636 --> 51:44.538
Hi!

51:44.571 --> 51:46.339
What's his name again?

51:46.373 --> 51:47.541
Tom Selleck.

51:47.574 --> 51:48.943
Hi. Of course.

51:48.976 --> 51:51.411
How could I forget that name?

51:52.579 --> 51:53.613
Does Tom want a treat?

51:53.647 --> 51:54.882
Tom Selleck just had dinner.

51:54.916 --> 51:59.053
Well, believe it or not,
I didn't come here to talk to Tom.

52:00.822 --> 52:02.824
I wanted to ask
about the hot water.

52:02.857 --> 52:03.925
The water?

52:03.958 --> 52:07.627
Yeah. I'm having a hard time
getting it to work.

52:07.661 --> 52:10.697
I really wanted to
take a hot shower.

52:10.731 --> 52:11.775
You know,
sometimes you come home

52:11.799 --> 52:14.869
and you're just dying
for a steaming hot shower.

52:15.569 --> 52:17.537
Showers are nice.

52:17.571 --> 52:18.572
Hmm.

52:20.842 --> 52:22.342
So, can you help me?

52:29.750 --> 52:30.751
Um...

52:33.620 --> 52:34.621
Stay.

52:37.424 --> 52:38.592
Bye, Tom Selleck.

52:42.029 --> 52:43.563
You want some wine?

52:46.433 --> 52:47.467
You want some wine?

52:51.638 --> 52:53.007
Thorp?

52:53.040 --> 52:56.676
I, uh... I couldn't hear you,
so just assumed the answer is yes.

53:01.015 --> 53:02.515
What is it?

53:02.549 --> 53:05.853
Um, malbec? I don't...
I don't know. Red.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.757
- Wow.
- You like it?

53:09.790 --> 53:11.092
I've never had it.

53:11.859 --> 53:13.426
Shut up.

53:14.527 --> 53:16.429
Well, here's to a night
of firsts.

53:19.100 --> 53:20.935
Is it working?

53:20.968 --> 53:23.104
Oh, my god. That is so hot.

53:23.137 --> 53:24.404
How did you do that?

53:25.773 --> 53:26.774
I hit it.

53:27.507 --> 53:28.709
Okay.

53:28.743 --> 53:29.744
Good to know.

53:32.046 --> 53:34.782
- This is how we do it.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:34.815 --> 53:36.683
Oh, yeah.

53:40.187 --> 53:41.188
I love this game.

53:41.222 --> 53:43.758
All right, your turn.

53:44.258 --> 53:45.492
Okay.

53:48.763 --> 53:50.131
Silly, that's not how it works.

53:50.164 --> 53:52.767
You have to choose
truth or dare.

53:53.700 --> 53:55.435
Uh, truth!

53:56.170 --> 53:57.171
Okay.

54:00.507 --> 54:03.077
So why did you come back?

54:03.744 --> 54:06.579
I told you. I had to find Sam.

54:06.613 --> 54:08.182
No, I know, but...

54:09.016 --> 54:09.984
But... but what happened?

54:10.017 --> 54:12.853
So you were here
and then you just, like, left?

54:17.258 --> 54:18.926
I had to.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.094
My parents made me.

54:22.562 --> 54:24.098
Well, where are
your parents now?

54:29.669 --> 54:31.205
Come on, you can tell me.

54:32.206 --> 54:33.673
I'm your neighbor now.

54:34.175 --> 54:35.176
Remember?

54:37.044 --> 54:38.545
Where are your parents?

54:40.147 --> 54:41.548
It's not my turn.

54:50.891 --> 54:52.727
Can I do my dare now?

54:54.261 --> 54:55.730
Of course.

54:57.798 --> 54:58.833
To coming home.

55:16.683 --> 55:18.819
Olivia.

55:18.853 --> 55:20.021
Time for bed.

56:29.323 --> 56:30.558
Ew.

56:35.162 --> 56:39.133
Options for thorp. Circle one.

56:39.834 --> 56:40.901
Leave.

56:42.002 --> 56:43.003
Die.

56:55.316 --> 56:57.017
Is this some kind of sick joke?

56:57.051 --> 56:58.252
This is my home.

56:58.953 --> 57:00.687
Maybe you should call the cops?

57:00.721 --> 57:01.956
No!

57:10.965 --> 57:12.333
Rachel already paid me.

57:12.366 --> 57:13.400
Okay, okay, okay.

57:13.434 --> 57:15.202
Look, look. Take a deep breath.

57:15.236 --> 57:16.704
I can't leave.

57:23.144 --> 57:24.311
I'm calling the police!

57:24.345 --> 57:25.846
No, no, no! Stop, stop!

57:25.880 --> 57:27.915
- Okay. It's gone. It's gone.
- Stop. Stop, please.

57:27.948 --> 57:29.717
It's gone. It's gone. It's gone.

57:29.750 --> 57:32.086
Thorp, now,
you're my boy, right?

57:32.119 --> 57:33.521
I am your boy.

57:33.554 --> 57:36.354
I don't wanna have to kick you out
in front of all the other customers.

57:39.493 --> 57:40.728
Sorry.

57:41.862 --> 57:42.930
Look. Look at me, thorp.

57:44.198 --> 57:45.199
Thorp, look at me.

57:47.001 --> 57:48.302
Now...

57:48.335 --> 57:50.905
Now, what's the one thing in the
world that makes you happiest?

57:52.373 --> 57:55.376
- Pancakes and bowling.
- Oh.

57:55.409 --> 57:58.145
- And pancakes.
- Yeah. I got you covered on the pancakes.

57:58.179 --> 57:59.679
How about I take you bowling?

58:00.848 --> 58:01.882
Really?

58:02.883 --> 58:04.418
I... I need to find Sam.

58:04.451 --> 58:06.921
That can wait. That can wait.
Let me take you out.

58:06.954 --> 58:08.822
Boys' night.

58:10.324 --> 58:11.992
- Boys' night?
- Yeah!

58:13.460 --> 58:14.795
- All right.
- Boys' night.

58:14.828 --> 58:15.663
Okay, thorp.

58:15.695 --> 58:18.265
Sa... just save some
for the ladies.

58:20.167 --> 58:24.238
I missed you so much
these past few days.

58:24.271 --> 58:28.108
I was afraid that kiss
might have scared you off.

58:28.142 --> 58:29.443
Kiss?

58:29.476 --> 58:32.746
Or that aliens had kidnapped you
and I should have called the cops.

58:32.780 --> 58:34.782
No, he's been busy
hanging out with me.

58:35.549 --> 58:37.751
I'd like another date.

58:37.785 --> 58:39.053
If you're up for it.

58:40.254 --> 58:41.288
Sounds nice.

58:46.393 --> 58:47.761
But this is boys' night.

58:49.964 --> 58:51.799
You know, some other time.

1:00:07.308 --> 1:00:08.342
It is different.

1:00:08.375 --> 1:00:10.177
When I was a kid, it was better.

1:00:10.210 --> 1:00:11.545
We were more connected then.

1:00:12.012 --> 1:00:13.314
What you smoking?

1:00:13.347 --> 1:00:15.049
People are more connected
now than ever.

1:00:15.616 --> 1:00:16.817
How?

1:00:17.384 --> 1:00:18.852
Really?

1:00:18.886 --> 1:00:20.988
Okay.

1:00:21.021 --> 1:00:23.624
Let's say my mom calls me up.
Wants me to make dinner.

1:00:23.657 --> 1:00:25.492
I call us delivery using an app.

1:00:25.526 --> 1:00:26.460
Boom.

1:00:26.493 --> 1:00:28.996
Or, if it's a hot summer day
and I'm at work,

1:00:29.029 --> 1:00:31.532
I got another app that controls
my ac at home.

1:00:31.565 --> 1:00:35.069
Boom. By the time I get there,
got it feeling like Toronto.

1:00:35.102 --> 1:00:36.503
I even met my girl using an app.

1:00:36.537 --> 1:00:39.215
I mean, I still got to meet her in
real life, but this is the point.

1:00:39.239 --> 1:00:42.543
I can control everything
with this smartphone,

1:00:42.576 --> 1:00:45.279
which, if you think about it,
makes for a smarter life.

1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:47.915
If you think about.

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:50.250
It's not real.

1:00:51.552 --> 1:00:53.020
You...

1:00:54.588 --> 1:00:57.257
This is a group text from
my boys from high school.

1:00:57.291 --> 1:00:59.960
If it weren't for this,
I'd never talk to these guys.

1:00:59.993 --> 1:01:06.600
Also, I could record live video and stream it
automatically to my friends and family at home.

1:01:06.633 --> 1:01:09.970
I can even call my girl and see
her when we talk to each other.

1:01:11.138 --> 1:01:12.707
Yeah, she's cute, right?

1:01:12.741 --> 1:01:16.176
I'm not gonna demonstrate right now 'cause
I'll never get off the phone, but...

1:01:16.210 --> 1:01:18.579
How's that being less connected?

1:01:18.612 --> 1:01:20.881
But you haven't even
met her in real life.

1:01:23.417 --> 1:01:25.018
You just said that.

1:01:25.052 --> 1:01:27.187
See? It's...

1:01:27.221 --> 1:01:28.622
It's not real.

1:01:31.492 --> 1:01:32.926
Thorp, wait.

1:01:35.662 --> 1:01:37.064
Wait up, thorp.

1:01:38.532 --> 1:01:39.900
Thorp, wait up.

1:01:45.707 --> 1:01:47.307
What are you doing?

1:01:47.341 --> 1:01:48.342
Come here.

1:01:51.645 --> 1:01:52.646
See?

1:01:57.752 --> 1:02:00.020
Someone's gonna call the cops.

1:02:00.053 --> 1:02:01.355
They do this every night.

1:02:02.623 --> 1:02:04.057
You do this every night?

1:02:05.492 --> 1:02:06.493
Yes.

1:02:13.735 --> 1:02:15.068
I'm out of here.

1:02:15.102 --> 1:02:16.170
You don't believe me.

1:02:16.203 --> 1:02:18.372
Believe what? What the hell
are you talking about?

1:02:18.672 --> 1:02:19.673
Look.

1:02:22.409 --> 1:02:24.011
Come on, they'll see us!

1:02:24.044 --> 1:02:25.245
Little baby.

1:02:27.114 --> 1:02:28.549
Forget it. I'm out of here.

1:02:33.387 --> 1:02:35.155
Thorp, stop!

1:02:37.357 --> 1:02:39.159
Oh, my god. Holy shit!

1:02:39.193 --> 1:02:40.694
- Mama.
- Do something!

1:02:40.728 --> 1:02:42.229
You have a little baby.

1:02:42.262 --> 1:02:44.531
- What do you want?
- You have a baby.

1:02:44.565 --> 1:02:46.500
Get the fuck out of my house, man!

1:02:46.533 --> 1:02:48.101
You have a ba...

1:02:48.135 --> 1:02:51.114
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop.
There's... there's no need for violence.

1:02:51.138 --> 1:02:52.272
Call the cops!

1:03:28.108 --> 1:03:30.677
You... what's wrong with you?

1:03:30.712 --> 1:03:32.179
Seriously, I wanna know.

1:03:37.150 --> 1:03:38.753
Nothing up there can help you.

1:03:41.655 --> 1:03:44.258
Yes, I know you're going through
a lot trying to find Sam,

1:03:44.291 --> 1:03:45.692
and this whole
death threat thing.

1:03:45.727 --> 1:03:48.262
But if you're not gonna talk to
me, you need to talk to someone.

1:03:48.295 --> 1:03:50.297
A professional or something.

1:03:51.866 --> 1:03:53.700
I like you, thorp. I do.

1:03:53.735 --> 1:03:59.373
But if you're gonna be
doing this, we can't be friends.

1:04:02.109 --> 1:04:03.243
I can't help you.

1:04:05.713 --> 1:04:07.114
I'm sorry.

1:04:16.623 --> 1:04:19.059
<i>Olivia?</i>

1:04:22.830 --> 1:04:24.231
What do you want?

1:04:24.264 --> 1:04:25.666
To talk to you.

1:04:25.699 --> 1:04:27.067
Go away.

1:04:30.270 --> 1:04:32.472
Olivia.

1:04:34.742 --> 1:04:39.413
And where were you when I needed
you the last three nights?

1:04:39.446 --> 1:04:43.250
The girls at my school are making
fun of me for not having any friends.

1:04:45.887 --> 1:04:47.789
I told them
I have a best friend.

1:04:47.822 --> 1:04:51.191
You. You know, we have
ice cream together every night.

1:04:52.559 --> 1:04:54.729
But they said you don't exist.

1:04:55.529 --> 1:04:58.165
And I really needed
to talk to you.

1:04:58.733 --> 1:05:00.167
But you left me.

1:05:01.368 --> 1:05:03.236
Just like you left Sam.

1:06:19.013 --> 1:06:22.349
"For thorp's eyes only."

1:06:29.023 --> 1:06:31.692
"I know where you eat pancakes."

1:06:34.261 --> 1:06:35.763
"I know where you bowl."

1:06:37.999 --> 1:06:39.734
"I know where you swim."

1:06:43.503 --> 1:06:45.539
"This is your last day
on earth."

1:07:08.528 --> 1:07:09.663
Rachel.

1:07:16.037 --> 1:07:17.370
Rachel.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:34.956
Thorp?

1:07:34.989 --> 1:07:37.859
What are you doing?

1:07:40.494 --> 1:07:42.462
I wanna go home.

1:07:42.496 --> 1:07:44.899
Wait, but isn't this your home?

1:07:44.932 --> 1:07:46.399
Didn't you grow up here?

1:07:48.936 --> 1:07:50.437
Yeah, but...

1:08:02.649 --> 1:08:03.851
You miss your family?

1:08:08.923 --> 1:08:10.323
Where'd they go?

1:08:11.092 --> 1:08:12.492
Far away.

1:08:14.494 --> 1:08:15.963
But where, exactly?

1:08:18.698 --> 1:08:19.767
Up there.

1:08:24.071 --> 1:08:25.305
Yeah.

1:08:26.107 --> 1:08:27.775
I miss my mom and dad.

1:08:28.709 --> 1:08:30.310
Where's your mom and dad?

1:08:32.013 --> 1:08:33.781
They are up there, too.

1:08:36.818 --> 1:08:38.685
I know what it's like
to be alone.

1:08:44.624 --> 1:08:45.760
Hey.

1:08:47.028 --> 1:08:48.461
I have an idea.

1:08:56.971 --> 1:08:58.039
Wow!

1:08:58.072 --> 1:08:59.941
Nice boat.

1:08:59.974 --> 1:09:02.576
I had another one,
but I lost it.

1:09:03.077 --> 1:09:04.544
Oh.

1:10:08.541 --> 1:10:10.111
What's up with your tattoo?

1:10:11.212 --> 1:10:13.480
This? It's my Mark.

1:10:13.513 --> 1:10:14.916
It gets bigger every year.

1:10:16.217 --> 1:10:17.651
That's wild.

1:10:18.652 --> 1:10:19.653
Yeah.

1:10:23.791 --> 1:10:24.926
You ever jumped?

1:10:25.793 --> 1:10:27.728
With Sam?

1:10:27.762 --> 1:10:29.196
No, it's too high.

1:10:29.230 --> 1:10:30.664
I wasn't big enough.

1:10:30.697 --> 1:10:32.066
But you're big enough now.

1:10:36.503 --> 1:10:39.673
I should be looking for Sam,
not having fun out here with you.

1:10:40.341 --> 1:10:42.710
Why is Sam so special to you?

1:10:43.576 --> 1:10:44.912
She's why I came back.

1:10:50.918 --> 1:10:52.119
Let's play a game.

1:10:53.154 --> 1:10:54.487
I like games.

1:10:55.122 --> 1:10:56.190
Pretend that I'm Sam.

1:10:58.025 --> 1:10:59.794
Tell me what
you want to tell me.

1:11:05.866 --> 1:11:06.901
Hi, Sam.

1:11:09.070 --> 1:11:10.938
I'm sorry I...

1:11:13.908 --> 1:11:15.710
Hi, Sam.

1:11:15.743 --> 1:11:17.712
I'm sorry I left
without saying goodbye.

1:11:18.279 --> 1:11:20.580
I wish I could

1:11:20.613 --> 1:11:22.850
go back to when
we were young again,

1:11:22.883 --> 1:11:24.584
when everything was easy.

1:11:25.152 --> 1:11:26.486
I miss you.

1:11:27.788 --> 1:11:28.990
And I love you.

1:11:29.991 --> 1:11:32.026
It's me, thorp.

1:11:36.629 --> 1:11:37.865
Let's play another game.

1:11:39.133 --> 1:11:40.700
Okay.

1:11:40.735 --> 1:11:43.771
If you jump off that rock,
I'll tell you a secret.

1:12:07.928 --> 1:12:09.529
So what's the secret?

1:12:44.198 --> 1:12:45.900
Wow.

1:12:45.933 --> 1:12:47.802
That was a good secret.

1:12:48.369 --> 1:12:49.669
Yeah.

1:12:50.971 --> 1:12:54.041
Now I want to take you
to my special place.

1:13:12.827 --> 1:13:14.762
All right, all right.

1:13:14.795 --> 1:13:16.297
All right, all right.

1:13:16.330 --> 1:13:19.300
Now, if your neighbor's snoring,
now's the time to give him a gentle nudge.

1:13:19.333 --> 1:13:20.801
This is important for them, too.

1:13:22.436 --> 1:13:25.306
James 5:16 goes on
to say, "therefore..."

1:13:26.107 --> 1:13:29.376
"Confess your sins to each other"

1:13:29.410 --> 1:13:32.612
"and pray for each other
so that you may be healed."

1:13:33.814 --> 1:13:34.849
You get that?

1:13:37.384 --> 1:13:40.687
Confess your sins to each other

1:13:41.355 --> 1:13:44.691
so that you may be healed.

1:13:44.725 --> 1:13:48.162
Now, while this was originally
intended as a confession for the sick,

1:13:48.195 --> 1:13:51.432
I want to empower you all
right now

1:13:51.465 --> 1:13:54.835
to confess to your
neighbors here.

1:13:57.838 --> 1:14:03.077
Ah. For the new faces here,
hey, uh, I'm frannie.

1:14:03.110 --> 1:14:04.912
- Hey, frannie.
- Hi, frannie.

1:14:04.945 --> 1:14:06.547
Y'all are family.

1:14:06.580 --> 1:14:11.018
You also know that I'm a loud and proud
transgender woman, and I gotta confess.

1:14:11.051 --> 1:14:12.720
There's a woman down
the street from me,

1:14:12.753 --> 1:14:16.824
who just got a new
Ferrari, convertible.

1:14:16.857 --> 1:14:21.262
Every time I drive past it,
I... I feel so jealous.

1:14:21.295 --> 1:14:23.464
Sometimes I, uh...

1:14:23.497 --> 1:14:26.033
Find my daughter's toenails,
and I...

1:14:27.868 --> 1:14:28.903
Well, I eat them.

1:14:29.603 --> 1:14:31.438
You know, it's... it's shiny.

1:14:31.472 --> 1:14:32.773
It's just...

1:14:33.174 --> 1:14:34.708
Too shiny.

1:14:34.742 --> 1:14:37.111
I miss farting in public.

1:14:38.179 --> 1:14:39.914
I got ibs, bad.

1:14:39.947 --> 1:14:44.018
I just want to pull over and
punch in the windows and...

1:14:44.051 --> 1:14:44.885
Piss on the hood.

1:14:44.919 --> 1:14:47.821
I can't help it. It's...
She's so cute.

1:14:47.855 --> 1:14:49.723
Defile it, you know?

1:14:49.757 --> 1:14:53.894
Oh, screw that.
Today I'm gonna let it go!

1:14:54.495 --> 1:14:55.863
But I don't.

1:14:57.198 --> 1:14:59.200
I just keep on driving.

1:15:00.801 --> 1:15:03.904
Seeking salvation
one day at a time.

1:15:03.938 --> 1:15:08.142
- Keep driving, b. Keep driving.
- Thanks.

1:15:08.175 --> 1:15:10.144
I guess I haven't really
been here in a while.

1:15:10.177 --> 1:15:11.879
Uh, my name is Rachel.

1:15:13.781 --> 1:15:15.950
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hi.

1:15:15.983 --> 1:15:16.984
Um...

1:15:21.021 --> 1:15:26.794
So, today is the anniversary
of my parents' death.

1:15:28.429 --> 1:15:29.430
Yeah.

1:15:32.099 --> 1:15:35.135
And for as long as I can remember
I've been searching for the...

1:15:35.803 --> 1:15:36.870
The why.

1:15:37.905 --> 1:15:39.039
Why did it...

1:15:40.374 --> 1:15:42.409
Why did it happen to them?

1:15:42.443 --> 1:15:43.544
Why did it happen to me?

1:15:43.577 --> 1:15:45.379
Why... why did it
have to happen at all?

1:15:47.581 --> 1:15:49.516
And, um...

1:15:49.550 --> 1:15:51.752
Every year when
today approaches...

1:15:53.187 --> 1:15:55.089
I'm just...

1:15:55.122 --> 1:15:59.927
I'm reminded of this
insufferable pain.

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:04.198
A pain that really ruined
my life, and a pain that...

1:16:04.231 --> 1:16:07.501
Makes me want to hurt others
in the way that it's hurt me.

1:16:10.271 --> 1:16:13.507
Or, at least, I don't know,
I had felt that way until now.

1:16:15.242 --> 1:16:19.146
I found a little bit of solace
with myself...

1:16:21.382 --> 1:16:22.983
And with my neighbors.

1:16:25.486 --> 1:16:26.987
And with a new friend.

1:16:32.393 --> 1:16:33.794
You see that there?

1:16:35.262 --> 1:16:38.866
That is the truth in the booth.

1:16:40.234 --> 1:16:41.402
Thank you, Rachel.

1:16:44.238 --> 1:16:45.372
Anyone else?

1:16:58.619 --> 1:17:00.154
All right.

1:17:00.187 --> 1:17:02.089
I want to thank you all
for sharing today.

1:17:03.590 --> 1:17:06.293
You... all of you.

1:17:07.961 --> 1:17:10.097
You make me want to be
a better human being.

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:16.036
Well, thanks for coming tonight.

1:17:20.107 --> 1:17:21.975
I, um...

1:17:22.009 --> 1:17:24.144
I thought you might
get up there and speak.

1:17:24.178 --> 1:17:25.979
You know, confess something.

1:17:28.949 --> 1:17:30.117
I didn't.

1:17:31.251 --> 1:17:32.353
I know.

1:17:36.590 --> 1:17:40.227
Is there anything that
you want to confess right now?

1:17:44.665 --> 1:17:46.166
Just tell me.

1:17:48.502 --> 1:17:49.903
I'm too scared.

1:17:51.338 --> 1:17:52.473
Just tell me.

1:17:57.444 --> 1:17:59.046
You make me feel things.

1:18:02.149 --> 1:18:03.250
Oh, god.

1:18:44.491 --> 1:18:45.526
What?

1:19:02.176 --> 1:19:03.377
No!

1:19:17.291 --> 1:19:20.027
I'm not ready for you yet.
Back to sleep.

1:19:36.577 --> 1:19:39.580
We're gonna play
another game, thorpy-poo.

1:19:39.613 --> 1:19:42.015
I like games, Rachel-poo.

1:19:42.049 --> 1:19:44.218
You can start by calling me Sam.

1:19:45.185 --> 1:19:46.053
Why would I do that?

1:19:46.086 --> 1:19:48.121
Because that's my real name.

1:19:48.455 --> 1:19:49.490
Sam.

1:19:49.523 --> 1:19:51.191
Like Sam Sam?
Like my best friend?

1:19:51.225 --> 1:19:53.260
- Stop talking.
- You mean I found you?

1:19:53.293 --> 1:19:55.329
Quiet!

1:19:59.066 --> 1:20:00.167
I thought we were friends.

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:01.368
Friends?

1:20:01.401 --> 1:20:04.137
No. Friends don't ruin
each other's lives.

1:20:04.171 --> 1:20:06.774
- I didn't ruin your life.
- Your family.

1:20:06.808 --> 1:20:09.009
Your family ruined my life.

1:20:10.277 --> 1:20:11.545
I'm sorry?

1:20:11.578 --> 1:20:13.046
Oh, my god.

1:20:13.413 --> 1:20:14.548
Every day...

1:20:15.616 --> 1:20:18.519
You go bowling,
you eat pancakes.

1:20:18.552 --> 1:20:19.486
I do love pancakes.

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:23.090
- You're a fucking kid. A child.
- Uh, what?

1:20:23.123 --> 1:20:25.292
I never got to be one.

1:20:27.528 --> 1:20:28.730
Well, that's crazy.

1:20:28.763 --> 1:20:30.464
Everyone's a child
at some point.

1:20:32.165 --> 1:20:33.233
No...

1:20:34.268 --> 1:20:36.637
I had to be the adult.

1:20:36.670 --> 1:20:40.073
I had to reassure my parents
that they were going to be fine,

1:20:40.107 --> 1:20:45.078
that they weren't gonna be opened and
closed, like a lab rat while they slept.

1:20:50.183 --> 1:20:53.086
It sounds crazy, doesn't it?

1:21:12.172 --> 1:21:13.708
What are you doing, thorp?

1:21:13.741 --> 1:21:15.242
Want to play doctor?

1:21:15.743 --> 1:21:17.177
Right now?

1:21:26.921 --> 1:21:28.488
Still no heartbeat.

1:21:30.858 --> 1:21:33.761
Your family played doctor
in their own way, too.

1:21:35.362 --> 1:21:36.496
Why?

1:21:36.530 --> 1:21:38.465
What were they looking for?

1:21:38.498 --> 1:21:41.168
Were there other families
besides mine?

1:21:41.201 --> 1:21:42.502
I don't know.

1:21:48.442 --> 1:21:50.243
And then that last night...

1:21:52.179 --> 1:21:53.815
You showed me the truth.

1:22:02.623 --> 1:22:04.558
I... I can't hear your heart.

1:22:08.428 --> 1:22:09.764
<i>Thorp, what is that?</i>

1:22:23.711 --> 1:22:25.847
Mom? Dad?

1:22:28.248 --> 1:22:30.417
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

1:22:31.753 --> 1:22:34.354
<i>Daddy... daddy, please wake up!</i>

1:22:52.272 --> 1:22:58.445
After that, my parents battled
depression, drugs, insomnia.

1:23:01.716 --> 1:23:05.385
We were trying to put
the past behind us.

1:23:07.254 --> 1:23:09.724
<i>But my mother was haunted
by what happened.</i>

1:23:25.439 --> 1:23:26.640
<i>Couldn't sleep.</i>

1:23:27.008 --> 1:23:28.375
<i>Couldn't work.</i>

1:23:32.546 --> 1:23:34.448
Nobody believed her, though.

1:23:44.291 --> 1:23:45.960
And in the end,
that's what did it.

1:23:49.429 --> 1:23:50.798
Nobody believed her.

1:24:17.457 --> 1:24:19.727
My father said
he wouldn't be selfish...

1:24:20.260 --> 1:24:21.896
That he'd look after me.

1:24:24.899 --> 1:24:26.666
<i>But he couldn't take the shame.</i>

1:24:29.070 --> 1:24:31.939
And on the anniversary
of my mother's death...

1:24:54.061 --> 1:24:55.495
I'm sorry.

1:24:57.098 --> 1:24:58.632
Where are your parents?

1:24:59.801 --> 1:25:01.035
They won't come back.

1:25:03.403 --> 1:25:05.405
There's nothing on earth
worth their time.

1:25:07.674 --> 1:25:09.744
They told me not to
come and find you.

1:25:09.777 --> 1:25:12.546
You got to say goodbye
to your family.

1:25:13.380 --> 1:25:14.514
I never did.

1:25:14.548 --> 1:25:16.851
We were so small
when it happened.

1:25:20.420 --> 1:25:22.056
I never wanted to hurt you.

1:25:24.926 --> 1:25:26.828
Somehow...

1:25:26.861 --> 1:25:30.131
Unbelievably, I had fun again.

1:25:30.164 --> 1:25:31.933
Like when we were kids.

1:25:32.834 --> 1:25:33.935
When I loved you.

1:25:39.506 --> 1:25:41.008
What am I supposed to do now?

1:25:45.112 --> 1:25:46.981
Killing me won't help you.

1:25:49.116 --> 1:25:50.383
No.

1:25:51.551 --> 1:25:53.620
But it might
make me feel better.

1:25:53.653 --> 1:25:55.056
I'm your best friend.

1:25:57.158 --> 1:25:58.625
I love you.

1:27:36.157 --> 1:27:37.191
Mom?

1:27:40.261 --> 1:27:41.594
Samantha?

1:27:48.970 --> 1:27:50.470
Oh, my gosh.

1:27:51.772 --> 1:27:53.540
It really is you.

1:28:17.697 --> 1:28:20.101
I love you so much.

1:28:21.769 --> 1:28:23.503
Please don't forget that.

1:28:26.340 --> 1:28:28.275
I love you, too, mom.
