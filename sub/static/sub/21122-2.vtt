00:00.780 --> 00:02.950
Previously on "The Mist"...

00:03.020 --> 00:04.620
This way.

00:04.689 --> 00:05.890
Are you real?

00:05.960 --> 00:06.960
Put down the gun.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.660
No!

00:09.730 --> 00:11.836
Team want to celebrate
tonight. Do you want to come?

00:11.860 --> 00:14.130
Alex is not old enough
for a party.

00:14.200 --> 00:14.900
I'm gonna get you guys a drink.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.260
Okay.

00:16.329 --> 00:17.970
Adrian saw what happened.

00:18.030 --> 00:20.670
He says it was Jay.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.110
We need to get inside.

00:28.810 --> 00:29.910
We got to go!

00:29.980 --> 00:31.680
Adrian. Wait in the car.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.320
What are you gonna do?

00:36.390 --> 00:37.690
Find my wife and daughter.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.120
We're safe.

00:42.530 --> 00:43.800
It's coming!

00:43.860 --> 00:46.360
It's coming!

01:07.450 --> 01:08.820
What do you see?

01:10.090 --> 01:11.960
Can't see anything.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.910
I tried warning them
there was something out there.

01:31.980 --> 01:33.510
They wouldn't listen.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.650
What was it?

01:38.720 --> 01:40.520
My dog ran to the mist,

01:40.580 --> 01:43.820
and, uh, something killed it.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.600
You think it could be
some kind of animal?

01:49.330 --> 01:50.330
Doesn't explain this guy.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.440
Connor's gone.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.070
M-Maybe it's, uh, chemical
warfare, like a-an acid cloud?

02:00.140 --> 02:02.210
Well, you're the soldier.
Shouldn't you know?

02:04.740 --> 02:06.540
What do we do?

02:06.610 --> 02:09.080
My family's at the mall.
I've gotta get to them.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.450
Look, there'll be food there,
supplies.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.120
I thought you said
you wanted to help.

02:16.190 --> 02:17.826
Yeah, but what about
the whole cockroach

02:17.850 --> 02:19.290
out-of-mouth incident.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.260
I'm not trying to force anyone
to do anything.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.320
I'm coming.

02:23.530 --> 02:24.800
Me, too.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.730
Well, I'm not
staying here alone, so...

02:31.130 --> 02:32.730
There's a police car out front.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.316
Let's find the keys
and get the hell out of here.

02:36.340 --> 02:37.880
Where's Connor?

02:37.940 --> 02:39.880
He's gone.
That asshole left us here.

03:24.350 --> 03:28.150
Mrs. Raven.

03:28.220 --> 03:31.120
Mrs. Raven...

03:33.200 --> 03:34.300
whose blood is this?

03:37.530 --> 03:38.830
- Yes?
- Father,

03:38.900 --> 03:40.176
Police Chief Heisel is here.
He looks...

03:40.200 --> 03:42.670
Is he here
because of my husband?

03:44.410 --> 03:46.110
What do you mean?

03:46.180 --> 03:47.980
There was a man in the mist.

03:48.110 --> 03:49.510
He came out of nowhere.

03:49.580 --> 03:53.650
He shot Benedict,
and then he shot himself.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.220
You can't see a thing
outside, man.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.320
Right up against the front door.

04:03.390 --> 04:04.560
When is the police coming?

04:04.630 --> 04:07.900
They will. Don't worry.

04:08.970 --> 04:13.170
If she wants...
- Thanks. - Sure.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.246
There's a lady
right here that knows.

04:14.270 --> 04:15.910
Thank you.

04:20.940 --> 04:22.710
Mrs. Copeland?

04:22.780 --> 04:24.100
I'm Gus Bradley,
the mall manager.

04:24.150 --> 04:26.190
Kyle said you saw what happened?

04:29.090 --> 04:31.860
Mrs. Carmody went outside.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.820
We heard her scream.

04:34.890 --> 04:37.390
She came running back
to the window.

04:37.460 --> 04:41.230
Her jaw was missing,
and then something...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.600
something dragged her back.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.440
What was it?

04:49.270 --> 04:50.770
I don't know.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.210
What about her son?
He's still out there.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.550
Come with me.

05:02.090 --> 05:04.690
Is it weird I kind of wish
that I had seen it?

05:04.750 --> 05:08.790
Not weird,
disturbing, profoundly.

05:08.860 --> 05:11.300
Should we go out
and look for her son?

05:11.360 --> 05:15.300
No one's going anywhere, Raj,
not until we know it's safe.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.470
Could it have been a bear?

05:20.540 --> 05:23.780
I saw her. It was no bear.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.440
What are we gonna do
if it gets inside?

05:29.510 --> 05:31.250
We make sure it doesn't.

05:36.090 --> 05:38.730
Okay, everybody, listen up!

05:38.790 --> 05:41.490
Until we get in contact
with law enforcement,

05:41.560 --> 05:43.660
we stay in here,
where we know it's safe.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.300
We're gonna lock the doors,

05:45.360 --> 05:49.260
so whatever is out there
won't be getting in here.

05:49.330 --> 05:52.170
I'm gonna need some help.
Let's hurry.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.740
I've got two keys here.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.170
We'll take the lower level.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.240
Okay.

06:00.510 --> 06:01.680
- I can help.
- Yeah.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.680
Let's go with her.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.120
Alex.

06:06.550 --> 06:09.050
I just can't be here right now.

06:10.820 --> 06:11.920
Okay.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.640
Mrs. Raven's in back.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.140
She said someone
shot her husband

06:23.200 --> 06:25.070
and then killed himself.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.370
Just now?

06:27.440 --> 06:29.280
Jesus.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.340
Shouldn't you go out there?

06:31.410 --> 06:34.180
She said he killed himself?

06:34.240 --> 06:37.110
All right. Then we sit tight
until we know what's going on.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.820
I hoped you knew
what it was out there.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.520
No idea,
but in case it's toxic smoke

06:42.590 --> 06:44.830
or something like that, we stay.

06:44.890 --> 06:46.220
It's better to be safe.

06:49.730 --> 06:52.170
Nat, I'm so sorry.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.640
Ah, it's okay.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.140
All right. Ahh.

07:01.910 --> 07:04.850
Hey, follow me. Follow me.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.710
Look, sit down. Sit down.

07:33.570 --> 07:35.370
What are you doing?

07:37.310 --> 07:39.880
Uh, I'm looking for car keys.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.210
The man found a set.

07:47.520 --> 07:54.090
I'm scared, okay,
like everybody else.

07:54.090 --> 07:58.200
I thought... these might
help take the edge off.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.800
Please don't tell him.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.930
He's gonna leave me here.

08:03.030 --> 08:05.100
I'm always the one
being left behind.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.870
You an addict?

08:08.940 --> 08:10.610
Who got us
out of that cell, huh?

08:10.670 --> 08:12.210
You think a junkie
could pull that off?

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
I want the truth.

08:17.050 --> 08:18.920
The truth is that...

08:20.380 --> 08:22.420
I want to feel better than I do,

08:22.490 --> 08:25.230
and you can go... yourself
if you don't understand.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.060
If this is gonna be
a problem out there...

08:28.320 --> 08:29.660
It won't be.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.130
It won't be if you help me.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.070
I need you to help me.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.480
He doesn't have to know.

08:42.070 --> 08:43.610
But the pills stay.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.590
You think it's safe
to get close to the doors?

08:55.650 --> 08:57.620
It'll be fine.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.840
It's fine. We're fine.

09:54.980 --> 09:57.250
Thank you for coming with me.

09:57.310 --> 09:58.480
- I'm Kimmi.
- Eve.

10:31.150 --> 10:32.620
Maybe she knows what's going on.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.250
What's wrong?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.190
One of the hallways
is filled with mist,

10:36.250 --> 10:37.920
and there's another body in it.

10:37.990 --> 10:39.360
Jesus.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.760
What the hell is going on?

10:41.820 --> 10:43.260
Where was it? Which hallway?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.470
This one.

10:50.530 --> 10:52.900
That's the administration wing.

10:52.970 --> 10:54.310
Do we just sit and wait?

10:54.370 --> 10:56.640
Shouldn't the police
be here already?

10:57.940 --> 10:59.270
There might be another option.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.140
After 9/11,
Homeland Security issued radios

11:01.210 --> 11:03.610
to all major public outlets.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.920
We got one of those.
It's in the security office.

11:10.150 --> 11:11.280
What's wrong?

11:13.490 --> 11:16.560
The security office
is in the admin wing,

11:16.630 --> 11:19.170
right where you found that body.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.450
Jesus.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.990
It's Theo.
From accounting.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.800
What the hell is going on?

11:43.860 --> 11:46.830
Some kind of terrorism?

11:46.900 --> 11:48.206
Man, what are you
looking at me for?

11:48.230 --> 11:49.530
I own a shoe store.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.370
Yeah, well you never know.
Hey!

11:52.940 --> 11:55.480
Maybe it's poisonous.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.840
Or some type of toxic gas
or something.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.650
Poison wouldn't rip his arm off.

12:00.710 --> 12:03.150
And Alex and I ran through it.

12:03.210 --> 12:05.350
Well something's in there.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.320
Something that came through
an open window.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.860
Do you see anything in there?

12:10.920 --> 12:12.450
Looks empty.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.190
Someone want to make a run
for it?

12:14.260 --> 12:15.936
Whatever killed him
could still be in there?

12:15.960 --> 12:19.700
The electronics store
has a drone with a camera.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.030
Dad and I looked at it
last time we were there.

12:30.810 --> 12:34.310
It's probably fine,
but let's hurry, just in case.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.080
Okay?

12:48.390 --> 12:49.590
Start the engine!

12:49.660 --> 12:51.160
Hurry it's getting thicker.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.230
What the hell?

13:05.740 --> 13:07.180
You ready?

13:07.240 --> 13:09.380
Yeah.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.520
Let's hope it works,

13:12.580 --> 13:14.680
it was the only one
in the store.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.200
Watch it.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.190
It's all right, I know how
to fly these things.

13:46.550 --> 13:47.820
Do you see anything?

13:47.820 --> 13:49.320
Shh!

13:57.900 --> 13:58.970
It's closed.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.230
We're safe.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.340
One of the other doors
was opened.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.270
Let's have a look.

14:13.740 --> 14:14.740
Looks empty.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.260
But we found the leak.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.450
Look outside.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.850
Wait.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.680
What the... Who wrote?

14:42.410 --> 14:44.210
What is it?
What do you see?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.350
It's another body.

14:45.410 --> 14:47.210
Another one?

14:49.950 --> 14:53.620
The drone... it's stuck.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.320
This can't be real.

14:55.390 --> 14:56.660
It isn't happening.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.520
This isn't happening.

14:57.590 --> 14:58.860
Look. Calm down.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.266
Everything's going to be
all right.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.960
It won't lift.
Goddammit.

15:04.030 --> 15:05.200
Who was that?

15:05.260 --> 15:07.000
I don't know.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.200
What did he write?

15:08.270 --> 15:10.140
Ammo?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.140
No. A-R-R and then something.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.500
I think it said Anna.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.010
Who the hell is Anna?

15:25.280 --> 15:27.850
Okay everyone, gather around.

15:27.890 --> 15:28.820
Here's what we know.

15:28.890 --> 15:31.790
Three people are dead, at least.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.520
Something is clearly very,
very wrong

15:34.590 --> 15:36.066
and we need to let
the authorities know

15:36.090 --> 15:38.790
that we are here and alive.

15:38.830 --> 15:41.570
Now since it doesn't seem to be
dangerous in itself,

15:41.630 --> 15:44.600
and since whatever it is
is no longer in the hallway.

15:44.670 --> 15:48.410
I suggest we send someone
to the radio to call for help.

15:48.470 --> 15:49.840
I'm not going in there.

15:49.910 --> 15:50.910
Me neither.

15:51.940 --> 15:53.680
Well someone has to.

15:53.810 --> 15:55.450
What about you?

15:55.510 --> 15:59.350
You're the leader here.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.290
Uh, I will.

16:01.350 --> 16:03.250
If my name is drawn.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.060
We'll do a lottery.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.520
You can't force people to
put themselves in danger.

16:08.590 --> 16:10.576
Well it's dangerous if we
just sit here and wait.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.600
You have a better suggestion?

16:12.660 --> 16:15.060
Or you prefer to run out
to one of the cars

16:15.130 --> 16:16.470
and take your chances out there.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.400
Anyone?

16:23.670 --> 16:26.740
Then that's the way
it's going to be.

16:32.780 --> 16:34.280
Where am I going?

16:34.350 --> 16:35.780
Another mile.

16:35.790 --> 16:37.230
Then a... Then a right on Beacher.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.660
Doesn't look as thick.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.390
Yeah. But why?

16:41.460 --> 16:46.100
I don't know.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.660
God.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.180
- Watch out!
- Help!

16:58.540 --> 16:59.810
I need your help!

16:59.810 --> 17:01.450
Please open up!

17:01.510 --> 17:03.080
What do we do?

17:04.480 --> 17:05.349
Get out of the car.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.450
Get out of the car.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.619
Okay.

17:07.690 --> 17:08.990
We just need the car.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.329
We just need the car.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.490
Okay.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.190
Get out of the car!

17:17.400 --> 17:19.869
Slow down! Slow down!

17:19.930 --> 17:21.630
Mia, Mia, slow down!

17:21.700 --> 17:23.839
Slow down, Mia!

17:23.900 --> 17:25.140
Slow down.

17:27.069 --> 17:28.440
Slow down! Slow down!

17:29.510 --> 17:30.880
Brakes!

17:38.850 --> 17:40.550
Is everyone okay?

17:40.620 --> 17:42.960
I'm just gonna need a minute.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.360
Me, too.

17:44.420 --> 17:45.690
Adrian, you okay?

17:45.790 --> 17:47.690
I'm fine. How's my hair?

17:49.390 --> 17:50.330
Improved.

17:50.390 --> 17:51.660
Adrian, are you okay?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.170
I'm dizzy.

17:58.940 --> 18:00.680
What the hell happened?

18:00.810 --> 18:04.010
When was the last time you
evaded a carjacking, asshole?

18:15.150 --> 18:16.720
Nobody move.

18:16.820 --> 18:17.820
Shh. Shh. Shh.

18:26.130 --> 18:27.130
Oh Shit!

18:32.560 --> 18:33.600
Get the door!

18:33.660 --> 18:35.660
Son of a bitch! Open!

18:35.730 --> 18:37.630
Watch the glass.

18:47.910 --> 18:50.510
I got you. Got you.

18:50.580 --> 18:51.620
What now?

18:51.680 --> 18:52.610
We run.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.680
Run where?

18:58.420 --> 19:00.960
The church.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.060
Where the hell are we?

19:07.130 --> 19:08.300
There!

19:12.600 --> 19:14.240
Wait! The guns!

19:16.240 --> 19:17.410
Mia.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.820
- Mia.
- You're not real.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.420
You're not...

19:30.250 --> 19:32.020
You're not real. It's just...

19:32.090 --> 19:35.530
It's just the withdrawal.

19:36.930 --> 19:41.400
That's, uh... I miss
you, baby doll.

19:42.860 --> 19:46.710
You're not... real.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.070
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

19:58.980 --> 20:00.550
Mr. Copeland!

20:03.450 --> 20:04.950
What's going on out there?

20:05.020 --> 20:05.950
I have no idea.

20:06.020 --> 20:06.950
Are you okay?

20:07.020 --> 20:08.020
Yeah, I think so.

20:11.790 --> 20:13.690
Is help coming?

20:13.760 --> 20:15.336
You ought to tell Clive
he should start writing

20:15.360 --> 20:17.280
those circuit breaker
assignments in pen, Father.

20:20.940 --> 20:22.240
You were supposed
to wait for us.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.530
Calm down.

20:23.610 --> 20:24.770
- Where'd you go?
- Calm down.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.570
What...

20:28.640 --> 20:30.410
Who told you
you could release my prisoners?

20:30.480 --> 20:33.220
You left us to die in that cell!

20:33.280 --> 20:34.980
- What are you even...
- Yeah...

20:35.050 --> 20:36.890
- Hey, Mia!
- This is a house of God!

20:36.950 --> 20:39.850
What the hell are you...
Take it easy.

20:39.890 --> 20:40.990
You want to be next?

20:41.060 --> 20:43.430
Chief Heisel. Connor.

20:43.490 --> 20:45.160
- Come on.
- Hey, Connor!

20:45.230 --> 20:47.730
- Hey!
- Hey, take it easy.

20:47.860 --> 20:49.300
- Connor.
- Try it again. I dare you.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.860
Oh, yeah? You think
that's gonna make me

20:50.870 --> 20:52.010
stop calling you a pussy?!

20:53.900 --> 20:55.770
Come on. Hey!

20:58.370 --> 20:59.870
We could have
been killed back there.

20:59.870 --> 21:01.456
I don't have to explain
anything to you.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.120
It's your job
to keep people safe.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.620
You left
a 17-year-old kid behind.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.620
I waited in the car
like I said I would!

21:08.720 --> 21:10.250
Then something attacked.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.660
I honked the horn
again and again,

21:11.720 --> 21:13.320
but you never came!

21:13.390 --> 21:15.136
Maybe because you were
helping stage a prison break!

21:15.160 --> 21:16.760
What do you mean,
you were attacked?

21:16.890 --> 21:19.760
I thought you said
you didn't know what it was.

21:19.890 --> 21:23.330
Yeah, well, like you said,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.000
it's my job to protect people.

21:25.070 --> 21:26.370
I didn't want to start a panic.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.910
Then what is it?

21:30.710 --> 21:32.510
What's out there?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.130
- Eve, I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

22:03.910 --> 22:05.680
- Mom.
- Don't worry.

22:05.740 --> 22:09.410
It'll be okay.
I'll be back soon.

22:11.310 --> 22:14.250
Just tell me what I'm doing
so I can get this over with.

22:15.380 --> 22:16.680
You shouldn't go alone.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.150
- Clint, please.
- I'm going with her.

22:27.130 --> 22:28.330
The security office.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.870
It's going to be okay.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.440
Going to be fine.

22:38.510 --> 22:41.410
It's gonna be okay.
I know.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.390
I want you to stay with Kimmi
until I get back.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.930
I just need to know you'll
be watched after right now.

23:05.270 --> 23:07.970
I love you more than anything.

23:25.390 --> 23:27.590
I'm so sorry about Benedict.

23:27.660 --> 23:29.630
Father Romanov told me.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.300
He was a wonderful man.

23:34.360 --> 23:38.830
He was mine since I was 18.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.840
Now he's gone,
I don't know what to do.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.490
Did you know
that if the bees die,

23:55.550 --> 23:58.090
humanity will
only have four years left?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.430
I'm so sorry.

24:04.590 --> 24:06.160
I mean, maybe he's...

24:07.760 --> 24:09.130
he's still here...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
in spirit?

24:13.070 --> 24:15.610
Oh, Kevin,
you're smarter than that.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.880
There is no spirit.

24:19.910 --> 24:22.380
There's just nature.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.540
There's here and not here.

24:27.180 --> 24:29.220
He is not here.

24:37.630 --> 24:39.730
Ready Eve?

24:39.830 --> 24:41.030
Yeah.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.030
All right.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.770
Run for it?

25:46.820 --> 25:48.190
There.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.860
Okay.

25:59.030 --> 26:01.800
Now fingers crossed the battery
still has enough juice.

26:08.210 --> 26:09.880
It has juice!

26:18.150 --> 26:19.650
You okay?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.960
It's fine. It'll be over soon.

26:27.290 --> 26:28.890
Thought you said
you weren't a junkie.

26:30.330 --> 26:32.900
I thought you said
you'd help me.

26:43.540 --> 26:44.680
What's it like?

26:44.740 --> 26:46.580
Tell me.

26:46.650 --> 26:48.420
Maybe it'll help.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.520
You know when you're
holding your breath

26:54.590 --> 26:55.920
and there's that...

26:57.820 --> 27:00.460
unbearable feeling
right before you relent

27:00.530 --> 27:02.030
and take a gulp of air?

27:04.160 --> 27:07.330
Well, imagine that feeling
lasting for a week.

27:11.740 --> 27:13.310
I'm sorry.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.880
Yeah, well, me, too.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.620
You know, when I stopped
running outside...

27:24.680 --> 27:28.450
I hallucinated.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.220
I saw...

27:36.130 --> 27:39.000
I saw a person I used to know.

27:41.030 --> 27:43.900
Except she's dead, so...

27:45.570 --> 27:47.840
Heh. That's what it does.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.920
Screws with your mind.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.420
Channel 19, come in.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.980
Anyone on channel 19? Over.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.560
Channel 21?

28:04.620 --> 28:07.260
Anyone on channel 21,
come in. Over.

28:16.970 --> 28:20.370
Arrowhead, Arrowhead,
do you copy? Over.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.410
What's Arrowhead.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.280
I repeat! Arrowhead, Arrowhead!

28:24.340 --> 28:27.380
This is Shadow 4-1 standing by
for report. Over.

28:27.450 --> 28:28.690
What's Shadow 4-1?

28:31.580 --> 28:34.680
How do you know how to...

28:36.920 --> 28:38.666
We should take the radio back
with us to the fountain.

28:38.690 --> 28:40.690
The radio stays here.

28:42.030 --> 28:43.600
Come in, Arrowhead, Arrowhead,

28:43.660 --> 28:45.760
this is Shadow 4-1
standing by for report.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.870
Do you copy? Over.

28:50.370 --> 28:52.110
What's going on?

28:57.240 --> 28:59.580
I'm going back.

28:59.650 --> 29:00.920
Not yet.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.980
Why do you have a gun?

29:05.050 --> 29:06.380
Who are you?

30:31.800 --> 30:33.600
Are you gonna
have a service tonight?

30:33.670 --> 30:35.770
I wasn't planning on it.

30:35.840 --> 30:39.180
I've just been thinking
a lot about Revelations.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.340
I think we should think less
and pray more.

30:45.620 --> 30:49.590
Still, when I pray to God,
He answers in your voice.

30:49.660 --> 30:52.630
That's the way it is for
a lot of people in this town.

30:52.690 --> 30:54.790
They need to hear your voice
when they're scared.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.770
Thank you,
Link, for your concern,

30:58.830 --> 31:01.100
but one form of nourishment
at a time.

31:12.310 --> 31:15.280
Uh, please,
wait for grace to be said.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.620
What if you
don't believe in God?

31:17.680 --> 31:20.050
His house, His rules.

31:25.190 --> 31:26.790
Where's Mrs. Raven?

31:28.160 --> 31:31.830
She must have needed
some time alone.

31:38.300 --> 31:39.886
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

31:39.910 --> 31:41.250
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

31:41.310 --> 31:44.850
Bless us, O Lord,
in these, thy gifts,

31:44.910 --> 31:46.850
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

31:46.910 --> 31:48.910
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

31:48.980 --> 31:51.350
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

31:51.420 --> 31:54.760
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

31:57.690 --> 31:59.360
Eve!

32:01.230 --> 32:03.630
She's back. She's back.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.940
The radio work?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
She okay?

32:09.030 --> 32:10.570
Give her a minute, folks.

32:13.370 --> 32:14.370
Where's Clint?

32:17.280 --> 32:19.380
We lost each other
in the hallway.

32:19.450 --> 32:23.120
I ran back for him, and he was...

32:24.420 --> 32:25.960
I'm sorry.

32:27.420 --> 32:28.460
Did you see what it was?

32:30.920 --> 32:32.390
And the radio?

32:33.530 --> 32:34.970
It wasn't working.

32:37.360 --> 32:39.530
We'll find another way.

32:42.870 --> 32:45.040
Give us a minute.

32:49.380 --> 32:51.750
You ever seen those guys before?

32:51.810 --> 32:54.650
In the mall? Around town?

32:54.710 --> 32:58.080
First time was
this morning. Why?

32:59.550 --> 33:02.690
I was thinking
about their families.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.990
They must be worried sick.

33:08.830 --> 33:11.070
What do we do now?

33:12.130 --> 33:13.130
Stay here for the night.

33:14.330 --> 33:16.570
Do you think Alex is okay?

33:16.640 --> 33:18.280
I'm sure she is.

33:19.770 --> 33:21.510
I'm sure your parents are, too.

33:21.570 --> 33:23.070
Mrs. Raven.

33:25.110 --> 33:26.250
Mrs. Raven, please.

33:26.310 --> 33:29.510
That's only for services.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.890
I'd like to have a drink.

33:31.950 --> 33:34.620
I'd like to make a toast
for my husband.

33:34.690 --> 33:36.860
Let the woman have a drink.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.190
Actually,
let all of us have a drink.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.800
Mikhail?

33:40.860 --> 33:43.360
If God can forgive me
for the things I've done,

33:43.430 --> 33:45.400
I'm sure
He can also forgive this.

33:51.940 --> 33:53.410
Thank you.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.380
I'd like to say
a few words about him.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.750
When I first met
my husband Benedict,

34:08.820 --> 34:11.120
we weren't even in our 20s.

34:12.360 --> 34:15.060
We had no money, no jobs.

34:15.130 --> 34:19.000
We were hippies
and very happy about that.

34:20.199 --> 34:23.500
We had each other, and that
was all that mattered.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.570
Our favorite thing
was making spaghetti together

34:26.639 --> 34:28.810
and drinking cheap wine...

34:30.510 --> 34:31.850
just like this.

34:34.909 --> 34:37.679
When we got older,
we settled down here.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.280
We actually had money,

34:39.350 --> 34:42.520
but we never stopped drinking
cheap wine.

34:42.550 --> 34:45.920
Benedict didn't want to forget
those days when we were young

34:45.989 --> 34:47.630
and had the world
in our pocket...

34:49.360 --> 34:50.960
and neither do I.

34:53.429 --> 34:56.270
I'd like us all
to drink in his memory.

35:04.940 --> 35:09.810
To never forget his warmth,
his kindness...

35:11.950 --> 35:16.020
and his love of cheap wine.

35:29.570 --> 35:30.640
Hey, hey!

35:46.720 --> 35:48.190
No underage drinking.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.250
Come on.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.690
You of all people
should know what it can lead to.
