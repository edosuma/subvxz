Hello, darling.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.174
Hi, Ma.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.176
This is for Tim.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.177
Where is he?

01:52.178 --> 01:53.178
I don't know.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.180
Oh...

01:55.181 --> 01:58.684
Well, this is
a welcome-to-our-family present

01:58.685 --> 01:59.686
for Tim.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.688
Oh, Corinne,

02:02.689 --> 02:06.191
they have the loveliest things
in the hospital gift shop.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.193
I bought one in red for Daddy.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.197
Of course, being unconscious,

02:12.198 --> 02:14.700
he couldn't get too excited
about it.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.202
Ma, I think Tim's left me.

02:17.203 --> 02:20.706
I've only been married six days,
and already he's left me.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.708
Oh, Corinne.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.711
No, darling, he hasn't left you.

He's 10 hours late.

Ma, he's been very depressed

02:33.219 --> 02:34.720
since his mother's death,

02:34.721 --> 02:36.221
plus he's not too thrilled
about moving in here.

Neither am I.

Oh, boy?

You. Simpson.

outside my door

Oh, maybe that's him.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.754
Yes.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.255
Tim!

03:10.256 --> 03:11.256
Where have you been?
I've been worried.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.758
What happened?

03:12.759 --> 03:15.260
Corinne, I spent
the last 10 hours thinking,

03:15.261 --> 03:17.763
and I've come to the realization
that I'm cursed.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.765
Wherever I am,
I bring death or destruction.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.266
I can't live here.

03:21.267 --> 03:22.768
Good.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.772
Tim... you
are not cursed.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.775
You're a part
of this family now.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.277
You can stay here

03:32.278 --> 03:34.279

03:34.280 --> 03:35.781
You know, Tim,

03:35.782 --> 03:37.282
let me tell you something.

03:37.283 --> 03:40.285
When Mr. Tate and I
first got married,

03:40.286 --> 03:42.788
well, we moved in
with my parents,

03:42.789 --> 03:44.790
and, look, we're still here.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.793
Now, I don't want to hear
any more nonsense.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.294
You are staying.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.796
Thank you.

03:50.797 --> 03:51.797
I guess it's silly of me

03:51.798 --> 03:53.298
to think that my mere presence

03:53.299 --> 03:54.800
could cause something
bad to happen.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.309
Well, if you ain't
the kiss of death,

04:04.310 --> 04:05.811
you come awfully close.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.319
Thanks for the ride.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.320
My pleasure.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.322
It's so much nicer
than taking the train.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.824
Well, it's so much nicer
than driving alone.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.325
Listen,

04:20.326 --> 04:22.327
could I possibly get you
to offer me a cup of coffee?

04:22.328 --> 04:24.830
A cup of coffee?

04:24.831 --> 04:26.332
Or tea.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.334
Root beer?

04:29.335 --> 04:30.836
A glass of water?

04:30.837 --> 04:31.838
Kaopectate?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.841
Anything. I'm easy.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.342
Coffee?
Yeah.

04:37.343 --> 04:39.344
Of course, coffee.
Come in.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.846
I'll make some coffee.

04:42.849 --> 04:43.849
Sit down.

04:43.850 --> 04:44.850
Make yourself comfortable.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.351
Thank you.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.853
It's a nice homey place
you have here.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.855
Well, it's home.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.358
I suppose that's what gives it
that homey quality?

04:53.359 --> 04:54.860
Probably.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.370
Oh, coffee!

05:05.371 --> 05:08.373
You wanted some coffee, right?

05:08.374 --> 05:09.875
Listen, are you all right?

05:09.876 --> 05:11.376
Oh yeah.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.878
Uh...

05:12.879 --> 05:14.379
I guess
I'm just a little nervous.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.881
I've never had a professor
in my home before.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.384
I've never had
a professor before.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.888
You ought to try it.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.392
I'll make the coffee.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.394
It's ridiculous.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.396
Well, Bob, I am sorry,
but she's put her foot down.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.397
I mean, this time,

05:32.398 --> 05:34.399
she wants to spend
some time with me alone.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.401
Well, what's the matter with
this girlfriend of yours?

05:36.402 --> 05:38.403
Is she afraid I'll see her
with no clothes on

05:38.404 --> 05:39.404
and throw up?

05:39.405 --> 05:40.405
No, Bob, that's not it.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.908
Hey, who are you?

05:42.909 --> 05:44.910
The coffee will be ready in a...

05:44.911 --> 05:46.912
Hey, Mare, who is this guy?

05:46.913 --> 05:48.413
Chuck, why don't
you go on upstairs?

05:48.414 --> 05:51.917
Oh, getting a little
on the side, huh?

05:53.419 --> 05:54.920
Bob!

05:54.921 --> 05:56.421
Well, there's nothing wrong
with a nooner.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.923
Bob...

05:59.425 --> 06:01.426
Incredible act they have there.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.429
I'm afraid that's not an act.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.431
Is he home yet?

06:06.432 --> 06:07.933
No.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.935
Oh, thank God!

06:09.936 --> 06:11.436
I hope I have time for a nap.

06:11.437 --> 06:12.938
He never lets me sleep,

06:12.939 --> 06:14.439
but first,

06:14.440 --> 06:15.941
I've got to have some food.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.442
He hasn't let me eat in days.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.945
I am faint from hunger.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.947
I just pray he likes this dress.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.950
He's destroyed all my clothes.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.456
My daughter-in-law.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.459
Happy girl.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.462
So, uh...

06:38.464 --> 06:41.466
Do you like teaching?

06:41.467 --> 06:42.968
More now than before.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.471
I'll see if the coffee's ready.

Hi!

Hi.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.477
Hi.
Hi.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.479
This is Anatole Martins,
my English professor.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.482
This is my husband, Burt,
and this is my son, Danny.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.985
Hi.
How are you doing?

06:59.986 --> 07:03.488
I can't tell you how good
even this crap tastes.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.990
Oh, Elaine...
Oh, no.

07:04.991 --> 07:05.991
What are you doing?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.993
Where did this come from?

07:07.994 --> 07:08.994
And that dress.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.997
Oh, no.

07:16.502 --> 07:17.502
She'll never learn.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.004
Nice meeting you.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.512
I think maybe I'd better go.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.014
Mary, see you in class, yes?

07:29.015 --> 07:31.016
Yes, yes, of course.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.017
Nice meeting you.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.518
Good night.

07:33.519 --> 07:34.519
Good night.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.023
Did loverboy leave?

07:38.024 --> 07:39.024
What's he talking about?

07:39.025 --> 07:40.525
Her teacher.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.527
Boy, does he have eyes for her.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.029
Why, I'll never know,
but he does.

07:44.030 --> 07:47.032
Don't listen to them.
They're crazy.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.034
Hey, listen,
I'd watch it if I were you.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.535
I mean, face it,

07:50.536 --> 07:52.037
this guy's got everything
that you don't:

07:52.038 --> 07:54.539
looks, class, smarts.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.041
See you, loser.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.047
It's happening,
just like I said.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.548
What?

08:03.549 --> 08:06.051
You're in school a week,
the teacher's in the house.

08:06.052 --> 08:09.055
I hate to think where he'll be
by mid-semester.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.058
Burt, the man gave me a ride

08:13.059 --> 08:15.060
so I wouldn't have to take
the train.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.562
Mary, please,
the old train-ride ploy?

08:17.563 --> 08:19.064
Mary, I know
all about this stuff.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.565
I'm an expert.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.567
I've got a welder, Frank.
His wife went back to school.

08:22.568 --> 08:25.570
Wonderful wife he had,
was known for her pot roast.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.572
Anyway, she takes a course
and then another one,

08:27.573 --> 08:29.574
and what happens

08:29.575 --> 08:32.077
is the teacher assigns them
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>

08:32.078 --> 08:33.078
to read.

08:35.081 --> 08:39.083
You don't get that,
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

08:39.085 --> 08:41.086
Then he assigns
another hot book, <i>Ulysses,</i>

08:41.087 --> 08:43.087
and then he assigns
another hot book,

08:43.089 --> 08:44.589
and one hot book after another,

08:44.590 --> 08:47.092
until finally, Frank's wife
isn't cooking pot roast anymore.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.095
Frank's wife is just cooking...

08:54.600 --> 08:56.101
and that was that.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.603
She up and left Frank
for this pervert professor.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.605
Frank told me
she stopped shaving her legs

09:00.606 --> 09:01.687
and was stranger than hell.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.610
So don't tell me
about schools, Mary.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.112
Don't tell me
about professors, Mary,

09:07.113 --> 09:08.613
because I know all about it.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.116
Here.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.617
What? What's this?

09:12.618 --> 09:15.120
The class I'm taking
is in poetry,

09:15.121 --> 09:16.621
and that's my first poem.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.123
"To My Husband?"

09:22.128 --> 09:24.629
To my husband I love him so

09:24.630 --> 09:27.132
That words merely
Diminish the feeling

09:27.133 --> 09:29.135
I would not attempt
To describe a rose

09:32.138 --> 09:34.640
That's what I did in school.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.645
I'm sorry, Mary.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.148
I'm sorry.
I really am.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.649
If I didn't love you so much,

09:44.650 --> 09:46.151
I wouldn't get so crazy.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.652
Oh, Burt, I know,

09:47.653 --> 09:49.654
but listen,
I am not leaving you.

09:49.655 --> 09:50.655
I love you.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.657
You've got to stop being afraid.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.659
I know.
Will you forgive me?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.161
What do you think?

09:59.665 --> 10:01.166
Hey, Mare,

10:01.167 --> 10:03.168
now, I don't want you
to feel bad,

10:03.169 --> 10:04.169
but your poem...

10:04.170 --> 10:05.170
Mm-hmm?

10:05.171 --> 10:06.672
It didn't rhyme.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.678
Well, the thing is,

10:13.679 --> 10:15.180
everyone in this family
except you and me

10:15.181 --> 10:17.182
is completely bonkers.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.684
Now, what worries me
is is it hereditary?

10:19.685 --> 10:22.187
I mean, is this
what I have to look forward to,

10:22.188 --> 10:24.189
setting sail on the banana boat?

10:24.190 --> 10:25.690
Don't be silly.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.192
First of all,
it's not hereditary,

10:27.193 --> 10:29.194
and second of all,
it's not even insanity.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.695
The people in this house

10:30.696 --> 10:32.697
are just
a little unconventional,

10:32.698 --> 10:33.698
that's all.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.200
Unconventional?
Mm-hmm.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.202
Our father's a murderer,
our sister Mary's a priest,

10:37.203 --> 10:40.705
Grandpa's fighting WWII,
and Mother lives on Mars.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.208
I don't know what to do.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.709
Okay, Billy, let's talk.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.211
Sit down.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.713
Thanks.

10:48.714 --> 10:49.714
Uh, get up.
What?

10:49.715 --> 10:51.716
And get out.
But we were going to talk.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.218
And we did,
and it was just lovely.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.719
Do come back sometime,
and we'll continue.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.221
Wait a minute, Eunice.
I have something to say.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.722
That's okay.
I'm finished.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.224
And I loved
every minute of this... But...

10:59.225 --> 11:00.726
Charmed. Delightful.
I'll see you.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.735
Oh, Dutch, I missed you.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.737
Where were you?
Where are you going?

11:12.738 --> 11:14.239
What are you doing?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.241
I'm going to make
love to you. Now?

11:16.242 --> 11:17.742
Well, if I wait
till after I leave,

11:17.743 --> 11:19.744
I don't think
I'll enjoy it as much.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.746
Wait a minute.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.747
What happened to talking?

11:22.748 --> 11:24.749
Eunice, I'm a fugitive.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.751
I didn't just climb
through that window

11:26.752 --> 11:28.753
from a day at the office.

11:28.754 --> 11:29.754
I've only got a little time.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.756
I want to spend it
being close to you.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.259
Oh, I'm sorry, Dutch.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.760
Eunice, I've got to...

11:35.761 --> 11:36.761
Hold it!

11:36.762 --> 11:37.762
Don't, Billy. No!

11:37.763 --> 11:39.264
Listen, you creep,

11:39.265 --> 11:40.265
I'm a green belt in karate.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.266
You should know that.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.267
We're lovers!

11:42.268 --> 11:44.769
My hands are lethal weapons.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.271
What?

11:46.272 --> 11:48.774
We're in love.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.278
You and him?

11:54.280 --> 11:55.781
Put me down, please.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.786
A convicted killer?

12:01.787 --> 12:03.788
Well, why not?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.290
Why should you be any less crazy

12:05.291 --> 12:07.292
than anyone else in this house?

12:07.293 --> 12:09.295
And I'm next, I know it.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.298
I already have
the first symptom.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.301
I'm talking to myself.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.303
I guess I'd better get going.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.804
Now?
Yeah.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.306
Oh, Dutch, take me with you.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.308
It'll only take me
a couple of minutes to pack.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.309
Forget it, Eunice.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.311
No, really, I'll be a big help.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.312
I can be a decoy.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.814
I can be a lookout.
I kiss nice.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.316
Eunice, put the suitcases away.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.817
You're not going.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.319
This is no trip

12:34.320 --> 12:35.821
for you and your
matching luggage.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.824
I've got to go by myself.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.827
Oh, Dutch,
what's going to happen to us?

12:42.828 --> 12:44.329
When will I see you again?

12:46.332 --> 12:47.832
I don't know.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.334
Oh, Dutch.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.340
So long, sweetheart.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.844
Be careful on that roof.
It's so steep.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.350
Here.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.853
It was stuck
behind the backboard.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.376
Sorry I'm late.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.877
I'll have a draft, please.

13:32.878 --> 13:33.878
Where have you been?

13:33.879 --> 13:35.880
I was with Carol.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.883
Are you sure you're gay?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.386
She had to go to the doctor,

13:41.387 --> 13:43.388
and I thought
I ought to go along.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.390
Thanks.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.392
Jodie, isn't this
togetherness thing

13:47.393 --> 13:48.893
getting a little out of hand?

13:48.894 --> 13:51.396
It would make sense
if it was another guy.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.398
I wouldn't be all that
crazy about the idea,

13:53.399 --> 13:55.401
but at least I'd understand.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.404
Dennis, this is
a very confusing time

13:59.405 --> 14:00.405
for her.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.907
She just found out
she's pregnant

14:02.908 --> 14:04.409
and I feel responsible.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.410
You feel responsible?

14:05.411 --> 14:06.911
What about the guy
that got her pregnant?

14:06.912 --> 14:08.413
Where in the hell is he, huh?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.421
You're looking at him.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.923
You're kidding.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.426
I guess you want to know why.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.928
I'm still wondering how.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.432
It just happened.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.933
It was late one night,

14:28.934 --> 14:30.935
she was crying,
and she was real upset,

14:30.936 --> 14:33.938
and I held her in my arms and...

14:33.939 --> 14:34.939
it happened.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.441
It just happened?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.942
Yeah.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.444
Well, how does it
work these days?

14:39.445 --> 14:40.945
Does she have to cry every time,

14:40.946 --> 14:42.447
or can you just skip over that

14:42.448 --> 14:43.448
and go straight
to the fun stuff?

14:43.449 --> 14:45.451
Dennis, please.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.954
Well, where does that leave us?

14:49.955 --> 14:51.956
I don't know.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.458
I'm waiting for her answer.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.960
I asked her to marry me.

14:55.961 --> 14:56.961
Marry you?

14:56.962 --> 14:58.463
I think it could work.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.964
Forget it.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.966
Hey, I tried it.
It doesn't work.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.469
And even if you
can make it work,

15:04.470 --> 15:06.472
I'll make sure you don't.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.988
It's not raining out...
or in, for that matter.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.991
This is the only thing I've got
that Danny hasn't destroyed.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.494
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.995
Why is he doing this to me?

15:30.996 --> 15:32.497
Doing what?

15:32.498 --> 15:33.998
Burt, come on.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.000
He won't let me sleep,
he won't let me eat,

15:36.001 --> 15:37.001
he won't let me get dressed.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.504
Oh, that.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.507
Well, he had to do something.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.012
Well, he can't leave you,
and he can't stand you.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.519
You asked.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.022
Am I that bad?

15:58.023 --> 16:00.025
The worst.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.030
You've got to stop.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.532
You cannot keep treating Elaine

16:07.533 --> 16:08.533
like that.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.034
But it's working.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.035
She's not nearly as nasty.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.537
Of course not.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.039
She's too tired and weak
to be nasty.

16:15.541 --> 16:16.541
I'm changing her.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.543
Danny, you are not changing her.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.545
If you're doing anything,
you're killing her.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.546
Well, what am I going to do?

16:21.547 --> 16:23.548
I can't spend
the rest of my life with her

16:23.549 --> 16:25.050
the way she is.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.555
Why don't you try being nice?

16:30.556 --> 16:32.557
Nice?

16:32.558 --> 16:34.560
Are you kidding?
With her? Nice?

16:38.564 --> 16:41.566
Listen, I went with a guy once,

16:41.567 --> 16:43.568
after your father died,

16:43.569 --> 16:45.069
a guy who,
for one reason or another,

16:45.070 --> 16:47.071
I was really rotten to.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.573
I don't know why.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.575
I guess I was just going
through a rotten phase.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.577
Anyhow, I was rotten to him

16:52.578 --> 16:53.578
and he was nice to me,

16:53.579 --> 16:57.582
so I got rottener,
and he was still nice,

16:57.583 --> 16:59.083
and then I got really rotten,

16:59.084 --> 17:01.085
and he still stayed nice.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.587
I finally gave up being rotten,

17:02.588 --> 17:04.228
because there was no one
to appreciate it.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.592
Being rotten is only satisfying

17:07.593 --> 17:09.093
if it has an effect.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.095
So you think

17:11.096 --> 17:13.598
if I start being
really, really nice,

17:13.598 --> 17:15.098
she'd stop being rotten?

17:15.099 --> 17:18.102
It's possible.
It's worked before.

17:18.103 --> 17:19.604
It worked with me.

17:21.607 --> 17:25.609
Hmm. What about the guy?

17:25.611 --> 17:27.612
He's in the dining room.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.114
I married him.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.617
Why are you like that?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.118
I wasn't always like that.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.620
I used to be nice.

17:35.621 --> 17:38.122
If you used to be nice,
you know how to be nice.

17:38.123 --> 17:39.204
Why don't you just be nice?

17:41.627 --> 17:44.128
Because I'm scared.

17:44.129 --> 17:47.131
The people I was nice to
turned out not to be so nice.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.634
Hey, we're nice.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.138
I thought they were nice too.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.642
Look, I guess there's
no reason why you should,

17:57.643 --> 18:00.145
but I wish you'd trust us.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.154
Well, I guess we can eat now.

18:24.169 --> 18:25.670
Thank you.

18:25.671 --> 18:26.672
You're welcome.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.189
Psst.
Benson.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.191
I think he's looking
a little better,

18:47.192 --> 18:48.192
don't you?

18:48.193 --> 18:49.694
Better than what?

18:51.196 --> 18:52.697
Than before.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.700
He looked dead to me before.
He looks dead now.

18:55.701 --> 18:59.203
Oh, Benson, he's not dead.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.705
Well, I didn't say he was dead.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.207
I said he looks dead.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.712
Chester, you just
have to be all right.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.714
I mean, you just have to be.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.716
We can't go on without you.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.217
Pshh.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.219
Chester, you are
the best husband,

19:15.220 --> 19:17.221
the best father,
the best friend,

19:17.222 --> 19:18.723
the best person.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.225
You are the best, Chester.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.228
We need you.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.231
Darling, did you know
that Benson's here?

19:27.232 --> 19:28.733
Benson!

19:28.734 --> 19:30.735
He's been sitting
by your bed for hours

19:30.736 --> 19:32.737
worried to death.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.239
Bored to death.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.742
[GASPS]

19:37.743 --> 19:40.244
Benson, he moved.
He moved.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.746
Do you know what that means?

19:41.747 --> 19:44.248
Well, I guess that means
he ain't dead.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.250
Chester?

19:46.251 --> 19:49.253
Yoo-hoo,
can you hear me, Chester?

19:49.254 --> 19:50.755
Whoo-hoo!

19:55.260 --> 19:56.761
How are you feeling, dear?

19:56.762 --> 19:58.263
Do you feel all right?

20:00.766 --> 20:02.266
Where am I?

20:02.267 --> 20:03.768
You're in the hospital, dear.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.771
Who are you?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.773
Oh, Chester.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.274
Look at that.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.275
Sick as a dog,

20:11.276 --> 20:13.778
and he still finds the strength
to tease me.

20:13.779 --> 20:17.281
Orderly, who is this woman?

20:17.282 --> 20:18.282
Uh-oh.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.284
I better get the doctor.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.786
Chester?

20:21.787 --> 20:23.788
Are you feeling all right?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.790
Who is Chester?

20:25.791 --> 20:27.792
Oh, Chester, you're Chester.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.794
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.295
I don't know who you are

20:31.296 --> 20:32.797
and I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.799
He's alive.
I can't believe it.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
He is alive.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.301
Do you know what this means?

20:37.302 --> 20:38.803
Only he and the chimpanzee

20:38.804 --> 20:40.304
have ever survived
this operation.

20:40.305 --> 20:43.307
Doctor,
he doesn't even recognize us.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.809
He doesn't even know
his own name.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.310
Give him a chance, please.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.812
Give him a chance.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.814
The man just got out of a coma.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.315
Mr. Tate,
can you hear me?

20:51.316 --> 20:55.319
I'd like a Fudgsicle, please.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.323
He thinks I'm
the Good Humor man.

20:59.825 --> 21:00.825
Common mistake.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.827
Mr. Tate,

21:02.828 --> 21:05.329
I want to ask you
a few questions.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.832
Do you know what month this is?

21:07.833 --> 21:08.833
July.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.836
July!

21:13.338 --> 21:15.339
He got that one wrong too.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.842
Mr. Tate,

21:17.843 --> 21:19.343
can you tell us

21:19.344 --> 21:21.846
who this gentleman is over here?

21:21.847 --> 21:24.849
That's Sidney Poitier.

21:24.850 --> 21:28.353
Sidney Poitier,
I can't believe it.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.858
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
Mr. Tate,

21:33.859 --> 21:37.361
one last thing,
Mr. Tate.

21:37.362 --> 21:40.865
Do you know who you are,
Mr. Tate?

21:45.370 --> 21:47.371
Oh, my God...

21:47.372 --> 21:48.873
I'm Gunga Din.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.378
You are not Gunga Din.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.882
Then I'm Gloria Swanson.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.887
Doctor?

22:02.888 --> 22:05.389
Doctor, what are you doing?

22:05.390 --> 22:08.392
I am giving him something
to make him sleep.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.894
I can't stand it.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.896
The man is behaving
like an idiot.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.397
Gunga Din.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.399
Well, Mrs. Tate,

22:15.400 --> 22:16.901
the lesion was much
bigger than we thought,

22:16.902 --> 22:18.402
and I might have removed

22:18.403 --> 22:19.904
a little more
of the healthy tissue

22:19.905 --> 22:20.905
than I planned.

22:20.906 --> 22:21.906
I don't know.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.407
I don't remember seeing any,

22:23.408 --> 22:24.909
but these operations
are generally so messy,

22:24.910 --> 22:25.910
it's hard to see

22:25.911 --> 22:27.411
what the hell you have
on your knife.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.914
Doctor, do you mean to tell me

22:29.915 --> 22:32.416
he's going to be this way
forever?

22:32.417 --> 22:33.918
I don't know, Mrs. Tate.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.421
Time will tell.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.924
In time,
you will have your husband back,

22:39.925 --> 22:41.926
or I will have
a hell of a lawsuit on my hands.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.427
Bye, Mrs. Tate.
See you tomorrow.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.929
Just a minute.
I have to talk to you.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.936
Chester?

22:51.937 --> 22:53.438
Chester?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.441
Gunga?

23:01.446 --> 23:03.948
Miss Swanson?

23:06.952 --> 23:09.453
Oh, Chester,

23:09.454 --> 23:14.458
no matter how you are
or who you are,

23:14.459 --> 23:16.961
I'll always, always love you.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.972
<i>Is Tim really the kiss of death?</i>

23:27.973 --> 23:30.474
<i>Is Eunice</i>
<i>ever going to see Dutch again?</i>

23:30.475 --> 23:31.976
<i>Is Elaine really changing?</i>

23:31.977 --> 23:34.979
<i>Is Mary going to have to worry</i>
<i>about more than just grades</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:36.480
<i>with her professor?</i>

23:36.481 --> 23:38.482
<i>Is Jodie going to wind up</i>
<i>with Carol...</i>

23:38.483 --> 23:39.483
<i>or Dennis?</i>

23:39.484 --> 23:41.485
<i>Is Chester going to continue</i>

23:41.486 --> 23:43.487
<i>to think of himself</i>
<i>as Gunga Din?</i>

23:43.488 --> 23:44.488
<i>And, if so,</i>

23:44.489 --> 23:46.490
<i>would Jessica buy him</i>
<i>an elephant?</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:49.493
<i>These questions and many others</i>
<i>will be answered</i>

23:49.494 --> 23:50.774
