WEBVTT

00:36.453 --> 00:38.621
I told you I would capture you, Joaquin.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.347
Now, you'll be extradited.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.815
You'll disappear. It will be
as if you had never existed.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.279
...in this summer.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.282
How are you, sir?
You don't even know us.

01:25.084 --> 01:29.047
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

01:29.631 --> 01:33.760
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

01:33.885 --> 01:37.847
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

01:38.515 --> 01:44.521
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

01:45.230 --> 01:48.525
Even when the clouds drift away

01:49.526 --> 01:52.445
Even when my skin dries away

01:53.696 --> 01:57.450
I'll be back someday

01:58.201 --> 02:01.871
To unleash my return

02:06.835 --> 02:10.797
I have the dust that protects the road

02:11.089 --> 02:15.260
I have the branches of a leafless tree

02:15.426 --> 02:19.389
I'm the guardian of the tired night

02:19.597 --> 02:25.603
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

02:26.604 --> 02:30.525
Even when the clouds drift away

02:31.025 --> 02:34.320
Even when my skin dries away

02:34.904 --> 02:38.825
I'll be back someday

02:39.409 --> 02:43.288
To unleash my return

02:49.335 --> 02:51.212

03:41.804 --> 03:43.056
Thank you, commander.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.891
We'll be in touch.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.116
We were able to evade
the Sinaloa lookouts.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.202
We're home now.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.206
Find more places
where we can leave men and weapons.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.208
ISIDORO'S SAFE HOUSE
GUASAVE, SINALOA

04:10.291 --> 04:11.793
This time, Los Mochis will fall.

PRISON SECURITY

04:56.004 --> 04:57.046
What's your name?

04:57.630 --> 04:58.506
Gloria.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.884
Did Valdovinos explain why you're here?

05:02.593 --> 05:03.428
Yeah.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.264
Sit down.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.206
Tell him I decided to go to Colombia
once I'm out of here.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.378
I'll need one of the organization's ships.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.298
Tell him to coordinate
the details with Ismael.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.434
One more thing.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.103
I'll need a map
of the penitentiary's surroundings,

05:55.271 --> 05:57.023
as detailed as possible...

05:58.316 --> 06:00.318
...where I can see where the house
is being built.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.708
Did he tell you what he needs?

06:16.626 --> 06:17.460
Yeah.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.017
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.852
Visits,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.354
walks in the patio,

06:36.604 --> 06:37.522
the regular routine.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.525
Did they start the work
on the Cutzamala River?

06:40.817 --> 06:41.651
Yes, sir.

06:42.985 --> 06:43.861
Good.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.075
We started construction
on the Cutzamala River,

06:49.450 --> 06:50.493
next to the penitentiary.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.454
It will help us to disguise the noise

06:53.538 --> 06:54.747
made by the construction of the tunnel.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.792
I need two men to infiltrate
the construction projects,

06:57.875 --> 07:00.503
so they can watch over the house
where the tunnel is being done.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.339
Create a surveillance perimeter
in the surrounding area

07:03.631 --> 07:06.008
so we can keep track of El Chapo
once he's out.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.231
Yes?

07:20.731 --> 07:21.858
Hi, sir.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.861
How long will it take
for him to be with us?

07:25.653 --> 07:29.031
According to the engineer,
it will be ready in three months.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.075
I already have the ship he requested.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.036
It'll be on the coast
in less than three months.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.164
Did you get the map he requested?

07:37.582 --> 07:38.458
Yes.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.003
Now, we have to make sure
no one finds out when he receives it.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.299
Sir, we're at the spot.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.426
Can you see the house?

09:54.051 --> 09:54.927
Affirmative.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.013
Keep me posted.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.449
This happened around
three years ago, right?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.033
It was something that surprised everyone.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.411
Why did you tweet
El Chapo Guzman?

12:26.412 --> 12:29.206
To be honest, I never imagined
a tweet would provoke such reaction.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.044
You said you trusted El Chapo
Guzman more than the Mexican government.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.796
Did you think that wasn't going to
provoke such a reaction?

12:36.755 --> 12:39.216
Well, that's what
I thought in that moment.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.218
Do you have any regrets?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.845
No, I have no regrets.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.347
I really do think that if we traffic love

12:45.431 --> 12:47.725
instead of drugs,
the world would be different.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.269
Then, why play a
character such as The Empress?

12:50.728 --> 12:52.938
Aren't you mystifying a drug lord?

12:53.522 --> 12:55.232
The Empress is a fictional character.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.443
A woman who is congruent with herself,

12:57.526 --> 12:59.320
she says what she thinks.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.198
I love playing this character.
This kind of character is unforgettable.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.325
People will always
remember those characters.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.202
Out of curiosity,

13:06.577 --> 13:09.038
did El Chapo Guzman ever contact
you after the tweet?

13:09.371 --> 13:10.247
No.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.874
No, never.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.261
How are things going?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.514
All's going well, Joaquin.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.849
When will the house be finished?

13:29.391 --> 13:31.352
We think it'll be done in a month.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.686
There's not enough time.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.399
I need you to find someone.

13:38.067 --> 13:38.984
Who?

13:40.903 --> 13:43.197
LOS ANGELES
CALIFORNIA, USA

13:43.781 --> 13:46.325
This one here,
when will we shoot that scene?

13:46.408 --> 13:48.702
In an hour...
I think in an hour it will be done.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.955
Once it is shot,

13:51.664 --> 13:53.415
we'll be done for the day.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.042
-Perfect.
-Perfect.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.048
Can you hold this for a sec?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.676
Yes?

14:04.051 --> 14:05.344
Miss Vanessa?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.930
I'm Ricardo Valdovinos,

14:08.013 --> 14:09.098
a Mexican producer.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.393
I got your number from the Actor's Guild.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.021
Mr. Valdovinos, would you mind
contacting my agent?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.816
I'd rather talk to you directly.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.819
It's for a confidential project.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.946
A really big movie.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.906
Well, in that case, send me the script
and I'll read it.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.825
That way none of us will waste time.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.159
Well,

14:30.077 --> 14:31.328
that'll be complicated.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.247
Why?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.543
Hello?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.170
Look, ma'am, I'll be honest.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.547
I'm a lawyer,

14:41.630 --> 14:44.258
I have a powerful client
who wants to work with you.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.053
My client is Mr. Joaquin Guzman Loera.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.347
He's a big fan of yours.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.017
He'd like to offer you this project.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.977
Can you travel to Mexico?

14:57.271 --> 14:58.188
When?

14:58.814 --> 15:00.024
The sooner the better.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.397
Some of you over here.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.569
You'll stay here until we have enough men,

15:45.653 --> 15:46.779
and we receive the orders.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.370
Hello?

15:54.703 --> 15:56.872
Sir, we just got
a new group of people.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.500
Good.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.210
Coordinate with the commander.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.003
We'll send weapons.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
MEXICO CITY

16:11.053 --> 16:13.347
Gentlemen, the senator
asked me to gather you here.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.934
She has a candidate for the medal
Vicente Guerrero for Mexican of the year.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.603
That's right, I nominate
Manglio Uriarte as a contender.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.146
Uriarte?

16:21.605 --> 16:23.023
Does the President know?

16:23.273 --> 16:24.650
Yes, he agrees.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.567
GREEN PARTY COORDINATOR

16:25.651 --> 16:27.194
Uriarte's one of our finest writers...

16:27.277 --> 16:28.278
WORKERS PARTY COORDINATOR

16:28.362 --> 16:30.322
...internationally renowned.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.575
We consider him to be
the best person to receive the medal.

16:33.951 --> 16:34.827
We request you coordinate this
with your parties...

16:34.910 --> 16:35.786
PRP PARTY COORDINATOR

16:36.328 --> 16:37.371
PAD PARTY COORDINATOR

16:37.454 --> 16:38.414
...so we can get the senate approval.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.541
Thank you, senator.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.584
I think it's a wonderful choice.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.921
As wonderful, if you may,
as you are every morning.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.134
Of course my party has no problem
backing you,

16:50.509 --> 16:52.511
but first we gotta hear the names

16:52.636 --> 16:53.971
of other contenders the senators
might propose.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.434
It doesn't matter what they propose,

16:58.684 --> 17:01.186
no one will offer you
what we're offering.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.691
Financial backing for the next
local campaigns.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.278
Greater participation within
the State Department.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.946
Thank you, senator.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.324
I love how passionate you are
with your proposals.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.745
If it were up to me, I'd approve them all.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.955
I approve everything, senator.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.041
Please, gentlemen.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.126
Don't mind my colleagues,

17:25.294 --> 17:27.171
we'll take your proposals
under serious consideration.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.255
Very well.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.924
Thank you, I look forward
to your decision.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.135
Thank you, senator.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.061
They told you
they'd think about it.

17:42.936 --> 17:43.937
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
MEXICO CITY

17:44.021 --> 17:45.355
It's normal that they'd want to know
other proposals.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.398
It's not that, Conrado.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.358
I don't give a fuck if
they consider it or not.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.861
The matter here is they see me
as an idiot.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.571
They laughed in my face.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.406
They're machos, Berta,
what were you expecting?

17:54.490 --> 17:56.325
To act as people, that's what I expect.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.538
Manglio Uriarte is loved
by most Mexicans.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.957
It benefits us to be associated with him.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.087
It will be a streak of popularity
for the next campaign.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.671
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.631
Of what?

18:10.839 --> 18:13.050
That everybody wants Manglio Uriarte
to be the recipient of the medal

18:13.133 --> 18:14.551
for outstanding citizen.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.638
-Why?
-Because he's openly gay.

18:19.723 --> 18:20.974
You complain about how those old
macho fools treat you,

18:21.058 --> 18:23.560
and then you want them
to award the medal to a homosexual.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.979
Would you award him the medal?

18:27.314 --> 18:29.108
This has nothing to do with me.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.111
You should propose it.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.781
It would benefit you that the
government recognizes someone like him.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.074
No.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.952
I won't waste a political favor for this.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.703
What if I ask you to?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.832
What you want is to get back at those men.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.000
You don't even care
who receives the medal.

18:49.586 --> 18:50.754
So, what if that was the case?

18:50.921 --> 18:51.922
Would you help me out?

18:56.635 --> 18:59.972
Why should I help you with your lover
if you're not willing to help me?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.068

19:48.020 --> 19:48.896
Are you ready?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.148
Yes, sir.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.609
All men are in position.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.577
For Los Mochis, fuckers. Let's go!

20:15.380 --> 20:16.340
Move, move!

20:25.641 --> 20:27.017
I don't have
good news, Joaquin.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.565
Isidoro and his men
took control of Los Mochis.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.736
They took us by surprise,
and our people couldn't do anything.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.072
They took the turf.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.575
Marcelo retreated to a new safe house.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.370
Check everything.

20:53.001 --> 20:53.877
Fucking Isidoro.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.172
He's an idiot if he thinks
he's gonna keep control of Los Mochis.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.718
How's the house going?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.221
It'll be ready in a matter of weeks.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.350
The sooner, the better, my man.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.272
I gotta leave to instill order
inside and outside the organization.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.525
You have any news about the actress?

21:22.572 --> 21:23.740
Thanks for coming.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.578
Where would you like to have dinner?

21:30.497 --> 21:31.748
The closer the better.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.292
Some tacos would make me happy.

21:34.001 --> 21:34.960
No way.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.087
The boss told me

21:37.462 --> 21:38.964
to take you to the best restaurant.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.841
If he found out I took you to eat tacos,

21:41.174 --> 21:42.134
he'd kill me.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.053
What?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.054
Literally?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.558
You're funny.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.108
He wants to make a movie about his life.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.278
He wants you to be part of that project.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.864
Why me?

22:04.906 --> 22:06.992
Because he admires and respects you.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.077
You're brave and blunt.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.788
When you speak, you speak the truth.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.541
Just like the tweet
where you mentioned him.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.088
But I won't make him look like a hero.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.383
I'm not interested
in a one-sided version of things.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.012
We'll have to tell his story
just as it is.

22:27.637 --> 22:28.555
Speak the truth.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.682
That's exactly what he wants.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.476
To tell his truth.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.270
How are we gonna work if he's in prison?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.397
If you accept,

22:37.522 --> 22:38.899
I'll take care of everything,

22:39.066 --> 22:41.026
so the right people will visit him

22:41.485 --> 22:42.819
to get the project going.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.284
I'm in.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.301
Why the long face?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.554
Are you upset about awarding
Uriarte the medal, or what?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.306
No, it's not that.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.351
I think that if Berta blackmailed
me with that,

23:14.726 --> 23:16.561
then she can blackmail me
with anything she wants.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.611
That power,

23:24.694 --> 23:25.987
comes from your secrets.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.408
If you stop having secrets,
she won't have any more power.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.206
If I discover of her secrets,
I'll override her power.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.213
Well, we better stop talking about Berta,

23:43.588 --> 23:45.882
and put the time we have to good use.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.853
You're right.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.906
I told you I was going
to capture you, Joaquin.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.909
You'll disappear.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.829
It'll be as if you've never existed.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.901
Now you'll be extradited.

24:47.652 --> 24:51.740
...yeah, he should choose some songs.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.284
-I want gummy bears.
-Gummy bears?

24:54.367 --> 24:56.036
I want some...

24:58.872 --> 25:02.959
You're gonna taste all...

25:21.311 --> 25:22.562
I need a pen.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.469
HOUSE

26:39.514 --> 26:41.725
ATLACOMULCO HIGHWAY

26:44.936 --> 26:47.939
VEST
SET OF CLOTHES HOUSE

27:28.813 --> 27:31.566
Mr. Warden, I think it's best if you came.

27:55.298 --> 27:56.341
What's that noise?

28:04.099 --> 28:05.850
Where is it coming from?

28:09.145 --> 28:10.313
What noise?

28:11.439 --> 28:12.774
I don't hear anything.

28:38.842 --> 28:39.884
Martin.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.512
Sir, the noise began.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.432
The tunnel will be ready at any moment.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.142
Get the plan going.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.185
Affirmative.

28:52.147 --> 28:52.981
Gentlemen,

28:54.941 --> 28:58.278
when it happens,
don't activate the alarm system.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.030
First, you'll inform Eduardo Rubio,

29:01.114 --> 29:02.365
he's in charge of security.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.534
He'll confirm the procedure.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.952
Is that clear?

29:06.077 --> 29:06.953
Yes, sir.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.629
Listen up, a couple of days ago,
maintenance work on the

29:16.755 --> 29:17.964
Cutzamala River began.

29:19.382 --> 29:21.384
The noise you heard today

29:21.634 --> 29:24.387
is related to the digging and casing
of the system.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.686
Eduardo, it is imminent.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.272
We're ready, Conrado.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.900
The surveillance perimeter
has been activated.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.235
I'm leaving on a trip in a few hours.

29:39.903 --> 29:40.904
Keep me posted.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.126
Thank you.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.503
I read it already.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.296
I won't need it anymore.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.557
Did you receive my book?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.853
Yeah, the story is clear.

30:16.856 --> 30:19.484
Please, give my compadre
and Hector a copy.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.152
TELEPHONES

30:21.277 --> 30:22.237
I'll do it.

30:22.904 --> 30:26.574
Joaquin, the actress was going send
a writer to interview you.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.076
Is that still on?

30:28.701 --> 30:29.661
We don't have enough time.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.163
From what I've heard,
the house is almost done.

30:32.747 --> 30:33.998
Only a door is needed.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.375
So long.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.592
Thank you very much for the support
to get the necessary consensus,

30:44.717 --> 30:46.094
and award the medal to Uriarte.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.346
You have nothing to thank me for,
Mr. Secretary.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.516
As long as it is to receive awards
and improve our image,

30:52.058 --> 30:53.810
people such as Uriarte will be welcomed.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.437
It would be another thing
if they wanted to govern.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.567
Sure.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.735
Gentlemen, how do you do?

31:03.403 --> 31:04.529
Is everything set for the trip to France?

31:04.821 --> 31:05.947
Yes, Mr. President.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.825
We'll leave once the ceremony is over.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.077
Your wife will be waiting at the airport.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.788
We're not leaving a mess
in the country, Conrado?

31:14.706 --> 31:15.790
Not at all.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.208
If there were anything going on,
I'd tell you.

31:17.792 --> 31:18.626
Let's go.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.755
This year, and deservingly so,

31:23.673 --> 31:24.966
the Senate has decided

31:25.049 --> 31:27.969
to award the Vicente Guerrero Medal

31:28.052 --> 31:29.345
to the Mexican of the year,

31:29.429 --> 31:33.641
our beloved writer Manglio Uriarte.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.505
8:46 PM
JULY 11, 2015

34:29.567 --> 34:30.568
Your shoes...

34:57.345 --> 35:00.890
8:52 PM
JULY 11, 2015

35:14.237 --> 35:15.363
Mr. Rubio...

36:01.409 --> 36:02.869
Mr. Joaquin!

36:02.952 --> 36:04.453
9:17 PM
JULY 11, 2015

36:06.038 --> 36:07.540
Mr. Joaquin!

36:15.673 --> 36:17.508
Where is he?

37:09.352 --> 37:10.519
The target has left.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.151
I repeat the target has left.

37:23.908 --> 37:28.621
He's leaving in a blue sedan,
license plate WZS5709.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.960
He's heading north of Santa Juanita.

37:34.627 --> 37:35.503
Copy that.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.470
NORTH OF SANTA JUANITA
STATE OF MEXICO

37:54.438 --> 37:55.856
The target has passed the second point.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.233
I repeat, he passed the second point.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.735
He's heading to the highway
towards Atlacomulco.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.904
NEAR ATLACOMULCO HIGHWAY
STATE OF MEXICO

38:02.154 --> 38:03.030
We're on our way.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.555
The target is in front of us.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.474
Don't lose sight of him.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.116
They took the highway now.
They're heading north.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.295
Copy that, we'll reach them later on.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.226
The target has taken a detour.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.937
They've just taken the highway
en route to Morelia.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.530
Copy that, we'll turn back and head there.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.821
Shit, there are three
identical cars.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.323
I repeat, there are three identical cars.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.244
The subject is in a vehicle
with plates WZS5709.

40:13.327 --> 40:16.205
-Can you spot them?
-They all have the same plates.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.211
They're splitting up.
The cars are splitting up.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.631
One is heading east,
two others are heading west.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.341
We need back-up.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.343
We're on the way.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.939
One is turning, and heading towards us,
what shall we do?

40:46.902 --> 40:48.571
Step out! Hands up!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.703
Another car is heading towards us.

40:55.870 --> 40:56.787
Stop them!

41:00.332 --> 41:01.459
Stop! Get out!

41:04.628 --> 41:05.796
Get out of the car!

41:14.472 --> 41:15.473
Did you stop the car?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.975
Yeah, we stopped the car,
but it is not the target.

41:29.695 --> 41:30.696
Yes?

41:31.238 --> 41:32.907
Sir, we lost him.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.119
How could you lose him?

41:37.912 --> 41:39.205
He's gone, sir.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.372
He had a plan.

41:40.664 --> 41:41.582
We couldn't follow him.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.919
I'm on my way.

42:06.106 --> 42:06.982
It worked, Hector.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.109
It worked.

42:11.111 --> 42:12.530
Conrado won't be able to catch me.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.963
