WEBVTT

00:04.522 --> 00:05.954
- Oh my God.

00:05.956 --> 00:07.456
This is beautiful!

00:07.458 --> 00:09.958
Bugs, I need you to
find us a good tree.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.893
Use your nose.

00:10.895 --> 00:12.361
- Mommy, I want that one!

00:12.363 --> 00:14.496
- That one's a little small
for us, don't you think?

00:14.498 --> 00:15.431
It is pretty.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.766
- Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas.

00:18.636 --> 00:21.003
What's your name, little girl?

00:21.005 --> 00:21.937
- Amelia.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.739
- Amelia, that's a pretty name.

00:23.741 --> 00:27.009
Is there anything you wanna
ask Santa for Christmas?

00:27.011 --> 00:27.943
- I want an iPad.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.745
- She wants an iPad?

00:29.747 --> 00:31.847
- She's not getting
an iPad, she's six.

00:31.849 --> 00:33.449
- Hey honey, why
don't you ask for

00:33.451 --> 00:34.683
something else from Santa?

00:34.685 --> 00:36.185
I don't think an
iPad's on the table.

00:36.187 --> 00:37.186
- Why?

00:37.188 --> 00:38.487
- Why?

00:38.489 --> 00:41.356
Because an iPad,
boo, is like $500.

00:43.227 --> 00:44.526
- So?

00:44.528 --> 00:46.762
- So, it's a lot, a lot of money

00:46.764 --> 00:48.897
even for Santa's workshop.

00:50.501 --> 00:52.568
I would ask for
like a science kit

00:52.570 --> 00:56.038
or like an art project, maybe
some clothes or something.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.473
I think that would
be good, right?

00:57.475 --> 00:59.141
- We have great science kits.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.777
In the meantime, while
you're thinking about that,

01:01.779 --> 01:04.413
if you want a candy
cane, I think Mrs. Claus

01:04.415 --> 01:06.281
left some on the
counter over there.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.216
Go grab one.

01:07.218 --> 01:08.150
- Thank you!

01:08.152 --> 01:09.651
- Mmhmm.

01:09.653 --> 01:13.489
And what would you like
for Christmas, young lady?

01:13.491 --> 01:14.790
- I don't know.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.325
I'll have to think about it.

01:16.327 --> 01:17.659
- Well, you just let me know.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.262
Mom, how bout a picture?

01:20.264 --> 01:21.764
- You know what?

01:21.766 --> 01:24.433
I would love nothing more
than a picture of my mother

01:24.435 --> 01:26.068
with Santa.

01:26.070 --> 01:27.069
- Oh, this is your mom?

01:27.071 --> 01:28.103
- Yes, it is.

01:28.105 --> 01:29.671
That's my mom.

01:29.673 --> 01:33.008
- Well, I saw Mommy
kissing Santa Claus.

01:34.545 --> 01:35.911
- Alright, got it.

01:35.913 --> 01:37.513
Thanks.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.214
- Thank you, that was nice.

01:39.216 --> 01:40.816
- You're a beautiful lady.

01:40.818 --> 01:42.684
- You have to be careful.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.953
That's like sexual
harassment these days.

01:44.955 --> 01:45.988
- I know!

01:45.990 --> 01:48.357
- Is my mom gonna [Bleep] Santa?

01:49.727 --> 01:50.926
- I don't know.

01:50.928 --> 01:52.628
- Alright, well, I
guess we're pickin' out

01:52.630 --> 01:53.729
the tree by ourselves.

01:53.731 --> 01:54.663
- Yep.

01:54.665 --> 01:57.132
(jazzy music)

02:12.049 --> 02:13.549
Can't believe Amelia
thought there was a world

02:13.551 --> 02:15.818
where she was getting
a $500 present.

02:15.820 --> 02:17.486
- I know, but I
mean, to be fair,

02:17.488 --> 02:18.987
she has absolutely
no frame of reference

02:18.989 --> 02:20.189
for what money is.

02:20.191 --> 02:22.224
I mean, a pack of gum
could be a dollar.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.826
It could be 1,000.

02:23.828 --> 02:25.093
- Well, she needs
some perspective.

02:25.095 --> 02:26.895
- Or she can just
go my mom's route

02:26.897 --> 02:28.964
and just blow Santa,
get whatever she wants.

02:28.966 --> 02:30.232
- [Mike] True.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.134
- Oh my God, is it
time for bed yet?

02:32.136 --> 02:34.002
- Yeah, it's two PM.

02:34.004 --> 02:35.504
- Perfect.

02:35.506 --> 02:36.738
Really don't wanna have
to go through Rob's notes

02:36.740 --> 02:38.807
before we work
tomorrow on a Sunday.

02:38.809 --> 02:41.476
- When are you turning
in that outline?

02:41.478 --> 02:42.744
You've been working
on it forever.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.346
- I mean, Sony wants it
before the holidays but,

02:44.348 --> 02:47.149
for my own sanity, I need
to get this turned in.

02:47.151 --> 02:49.651
I just have like dick
jokes going through my head

02:49.653 --> 02:51.153
all night long.

02:51.155 --> 02:54.323
They're like sugar plums
but fleshier and more veiny.

02:54.325 --> 02:55.624
- Merry Christmas.

02:55.626 --> 02:58.093
- Ah God, my back
is still so sore.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.928
I have not slept
well in two weeks.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.697
- It's 'cause you're hunching
over your computer all day.

03:01.699 --> 03:03.165
- I think you're right.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.868
Ya know, one fun thing that
happened at work the other day,

03:05.870 --> 03:07.436
I bumped into this guy, Noah,

03:07.438 --> 03:11.306
who I'd had sex with that I
had completely forgotten about.

03:11.308 --> 03:13.141
- Why do you feel this is
something you need to tell me?

03:13.143 --> 03:15.277
- I just thought it was
weird because ya know,

03:15.279 --> 03:17.980
I just forgot that
he even existed.

03:17.982 --> 03:22.251
I will tell you, time
has not been his friend.

03:22.253 --> 03:23.318
- Well, I hope
you told him that.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.820
- I did.

03:24.822 --> 03:26.588
I was like, ya know what,
I forgot that you and I

03:26.590 --> 03:30.659
have had sex and by the
way, you look terrible.

03:30.661 --> 03:32.160
- How did he take it?

03:32.162 --> 03:33.328
- He laughed and then tried
to have sex with me again.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.664
It was very uncomfortable.

03:35.666 --> 03:36.899
- That's rough.

03:36.901 --> 03:38.667
- Speaking of not aging
well, my mother, boom,

03:38.669 --> 03:41.870
keeps harassing me for
Christmas ideas for you.

03:41.872 --> 03:44.172
So get like a list
together or something.

03:44.174 --> 03:45.674
- Does it even
matter what I say?

03:45.676 --> 03:48.410
Isn't she just gonna get
me some X-rated joke gift?

03:48.412 --> 03:49.878
- God, I hope so.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.314
I can't help it the fact
that my mother injects filth

03:52.316 --> 03:54.716
into our Christmas,
I find delightful.

03:54.718 --> 03:56.118
- It's how I know
you're related.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.119
- Really?

03:57.121 --> 03:58.620
I thought it was our nipples.

03:58.622 --> 04:02.257
Remember when you saw
her nipple at the pool?

04:02.259 --> 04:03.358
- Yeah, I do.

04:04.895 --> 04:06.161
- Cool.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.664
(light music)

04:08.666 --> 04:10.098
- [Amelia] Mommy, I'm hungry.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.967
- You literally ate
breakfast 10 minutes ago.

04:11.969 --> 04:14.202
- Well, I'm hungry again.

04:14.204 --> 04:15.270
- Oh my God.

04:15.272 --> 04:17.539
Here, gnaw on some almonds.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.976
(phone ringing)

04:20.978 --> 04:22.477
Hey honey, what's happening?

04:22.479 --> 04:23.278
- Nothing, I just wanted
to make sure that you were

04:23.280 --> 04:23.912
checking your email.

04:23.914 --> 04:25.380
- Why?

04:25.382 --> 04:27.316
- Apparently, Amelia needs
a pop of color for her

04:27.318 --> 04:28.650
camp's holiday show.

04:28.652 --> 04:30.385
- Oh yes, that's right.

04:30.387 --> 04:32.587
She's an aquamarine, I forgot.

04:32.589 --> 04:34.089
- What is a pop of color?

04:34.091 --> 04:36.525
- I don't know but these are
the kinds of cool phrases

04:36.527 --> 04:38.694
her camp has introduced me to.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.562
I think it's just like a
blue headband or blue socks

04:40.564 --> 04:41.830
or something.

04:41.832 --> 04:43.031
- OK, you want me to
pick something up?

04:43.033 --> 04:44.232
- No, I'm already out.

04:44.234 --> 04:45.400
I'll grab something.

04:45.402 --> 04:48.570
Ugh God, my back
really is killing me.

04:48.572 --> 04:50.238
- Why don't you get a massage?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.341
You should use that couples
massage that we never used.

04:52.343 --> 04:53.842
- This week is insane.

04:53.844 --> 04:55.277
There's no way I
can fit that in.

04:55.279 --> 04:56.712
- It's just a couple
hours and it'll probably

04:56.714 --> 04:57.679
help you sleep better.

04:57.681 --> 04:58.580
- That's true.

04:58.582 --> 04:59.514
When do you wanna go?

04:59.516 --> 05:00.449
- Oh, I can't go.

05:00.451 --> 05:01.249
This week's crazy for me.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.484
- OK, eat a D.

05:02.486 --> 05:03.752
- Why don't you
take someone else?

05:03.754 --> 05:04.686
Take your mom!

05:04.688 --> 05:05.620
- [Andrea] She would love that.

05:05.622 --> 05:07.856
- Eat a D, eat a D, eat a D!

05:12.363 --> 05:14.062
- I should probably
get off the phone.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.130
- Yeah.
- Bye!

05:18.135 --> 05:20.969
Don't say that at
camp though, OK?

05:23.040 --> 05:26.174
(jazzy music)

05:26.176 --> 05:27.843
- [Amelia] Mommy, can
we get a lip balm?

05:27.845 --> 05:28.777
- I don't know, how much is it?

05:28.779 --> 05:29.845
- It's only one dollar.

05:29.847 --> 05:31.980
- Only one dollar?

05:31.982 --> 05:36.218
You know that a dollar
is a lot of money, OK?

05:36.220 --> 05:38.620
And when we're thinking
about spending a dollar,

05:38.622 --> 05:40.122
we have to think about
is it something that

05:40.124 --> 05:43.191
we really need and
can we afford that

05:43.193 --> 05:46.228
because Daddy and I
have to work very hard

05:46.230 --> 05:48.497
to earn a whole dollar.

05:48.499 --> 05:51.199
So, is that lip balm
something that you really,

05:51.201 --> 05:53.468
really need to have?

05:53.470 --> 05:55.804
- No, I guess not.

05:55.806 --> 05:58.206
- Well then, why don't we
spend our hard earned money

05:58.208 --> 06:01.810
on something we do need,
like a pop of color?

06:01.812 --> 06:03.011
- OK.

06:03.013 --> 06:05.814
- Just look for
something blue, OK?

06:05.816 --> 06:08.150
- Hey Andrea, it's
Carrie from Sony.

06:08.152 --> 06:09.484
- Yes, hi!

06:09.486 --> 06:11.153
How are you?
- I'm great!

06:11.155 --> 06:12.487
How's the outline coming?

06:12.489 --> 06:13.722
- Good, good!

06:13.724 --> 06:15.390
We're very excited for
you guys to read it.

06:15.392 --> 06:16.792
We've been working nonstop.

06:16.794 --> 06:20.195
I mean, I guess not
technically nonstop

06:20.197 --> 06:21.730
'cause I'm here shopping but--

06:21.732 --> 06:22.964
- Right.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.433
- That's just for
my daughter's camp.

06:24.435 --> 06:26.301
I'm heading over to work with
Rob right after this, so.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.203
- Well great, we look
forward to reading it.

06:28.205 --> 06:29.404
- Good, we are excited.

06:29.406 --> 06:30.672
- Mommy, I found the socks.

06:30.674 --> 06:32.140
- Great, perfect,
let's get those.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.642
- Are you sure we
can afford them?

06:33.644 --> 06:35.477
They're three dollars.

06:37.881 --> 06:41.016
- Yes, we can
afford three dollars

06:41.018 --> 06:44.586
because it's something
ya know, that we need.

06:44.588 --> 06:46.621
It's still a lot of money.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.857
Why don't you get in line?

06:48.859 --> 06:50.025
I will meet ya there.

06:50.027 --> 06:51.293
- OK.

06:51.295 --> 06:53.295
- We're just teaching
her about money.

06:53.297 --> 06:55.297
So I had to make it
seem like a big deal.

06:55.299 --> 06:57.532
But obviously, we're doing fine.

06:57.534 --> 06:59.434
I can afford socks.

06:59.436 --> 07:01.436
I just bought new shoes, right?

07:01.438 --> 07:03.171
That's like 30 socks.

07:04.908 --> 07:05.740
Anyway--

07:05.742 --> 07:06.575
- It's great to see you.

07:06.577 --> 07:07.709
- Good to see you too.

07:07.711 --> 07:09.244
- Have a good one.

07:09.246 --> 07:10.479
- You too, bye.

07:12.116 --> 07:15.183
I mean, I guess good news
is now Carrie doesn't think

07:15.185 --> 07:16.751
I can afford socks.

07:16.753 --> 07:19.287
So, she'll probably keep
us on the payroll longer.

07:19.289 --> 07:21.990
- Yeah or maybe she sees
you out there shopping

07:21.992 --> 07:24.326
without a care in the
world and now our outline

07:24.328 --> 07:26.461
has to be extra [Bleep] perfect.

07:26.463 --> 07:28.363
- Then, you're welcome.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.297
- You're welcome?

07:29.299 --> 07:30.532
- Yeah.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.000
- I never thanked
you, literally.

07:32.002 --> 07:33.368
- Well, I'm getting ahead
of it 'cause I imagine

07:33.370 --> 07:35.337
the outline will
now turn out better.

07:35.339 --> 07:37.906
So, this is my future
self saying you're welcome

07:37.908 --> 07:39.774
to the present you.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.409
- When you said
the word outline, I
realized we were still

07:41.411 --> 07:43.011
just on the outline
stage and I literally,

07:43.013 --> 07:44.513
my soul just died.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.282
- I know, I know.

07:47.284 --> 07:48.250
Oh shit.

07:48.252 --> 07:49.484
- What?

07:49.486 --> 07:50.819
- Amelia's camp forgot
to say all the kids need

07:50.821 --> 07:52.053
white T-shirts.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.388
Hold on, I've just
gotta text Mike

07:53.390 --> 07:55.123
and check if we've got one.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.892
- Hey babe, you need to relax.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.394
Anyone ever said to you hey
babe, you need to relax?

07:59.396 --> 08:00.595
- You know what?

08:00.597 --> 08:02.063
Ya dick did 'cause
it's always relaxing.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.900
'Cause it never gets [Bleep].

08:04.902 --> 08:08.537
- That is not what your
mother thought last night.

08:08.539 --> 08:10.672
- Cool, then my mother
and I have something to

08:10.674 --> 08:12.674
giggle about when
we get our couples

08:12.676 --> 08:14.543
massage on Friday together.

08:14.545 --> 08:15.877
- Couples massage with your mom?

08:15.879 --> 08:18.547
- Yeah at 8:30 AM on a Friday.

08:18.549 --> 08:19.948
That's gonna relax me, right?

08:19.950 --> 08:22.317
- I guess, if you like
staring at your mother's puss.

08:22.319 --> 08:25.153
- I don't believe that's the
service that I signed up for.

08:25.155 --> 08:26.855
So, I think I'm good.

08:26.857 --> 08:28.356
- No, no, no.

08:28.358 --> 08:30.892
I mean, you're spending the
day at a spa with your mother.

08:30.894 --> 08:32.594
You're definitely
gonna see her naked.

08:32.596 --> 08:33.862
- Oh God.

08:33.864 --> 08:35.397
- Sorry, it's just
what's happening.

08:35.399 --> 08:37.499
- See, ya know, this is why I
don't like going to spas, OK?

08:37.501 --> 08:39.768
I don't know who's
gonna be naked.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.136
- You, you're gonna be naked.

08:41.138 --> 08:42.304
With your mom.

08:42.306 --> 08:44.306
- God, OK, ya know what?

08:44.308 --> 08:46.174
- And wait, and you're
getting a massage?

08:46.176 --> 08:47.676
- Yes, I'm getting a massage.

08:47.678 --> 08:50.345
- Sounds to me like someone
wants to get her puss touched.

08:50.347 --> 08:51.446
- Alright, I'm out.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.681
I'm stressed enough.

08:52.683 --> 08:53.748
I don't wanna get
my puss touched.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.083
Alright, so good news for you.

08:55.085 --> 08:56.885
Now we can meet
at 8:30 on Friday.

08:56.887 --> 08:59.854
- Ya know what, I feel like I
didn't accurately kinda sell.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.656
So maybe I could do it again.
- I think you sold it.

09:01.658 --> 09:04.359
- If I said it like
this, is it better?

09:04.361 --> 09:05.193
Puss.

09:06.663 --> 09:08.330
- I know you're not
nna believe me,

09:08.332 --> 09:09.698
yes, it was better.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.099
- Great, alright.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.586
(light music)

09:14.588 --> 09:17.289
- Sorry, oh my God,
parking was a nightmare.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.491
(sighs) Here we go.

09:19.493 --> 09:20.892
- You OK?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.361
- Yes, I have 75 minutes
allotted to celebrate my child.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.764
- Look, this is so cute.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.998
- I know!

09:27.000 --> 09:30.235
Mom, is that my early
Christmas present?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.770
Is it from the pleasure chest?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.005
- No, a little
something for Amelia.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.942
- Is it a Santa
penis wine stopper?

09:36.944 --> 09:39.044
- That would be so funny.

09:42.149 --> 09:42.981
- I didn't make it up.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.149
You got me one one year.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.383
- I did get you that?

09:45.385 --> 09:46.217
- Yes!

09:46.219 --> 09:47.752
- Oh God, I love those.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.689
- Oh, that's one of my
favorite things about you.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.190
- Oh, I know.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.859
This year, I had to pull
back because Amelia's

09:54.861 --> 09:57.429
getting older and she's
ruining all my fun.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.663
- Mom!

09:58.665 --> 10:00.131
Look at you, you're growing up.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.067
You know what, pretty
soon, your body's gonna be

10:02.069 --> 10:03.868
going through some changes.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.870
I don't want you
to be alarmed but,

10:05.872 --> 10:08.139
things will be drying
up and falling off.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.407
- How dare you!

10:09.409 --> 10:11.076
- I'm so happy you're here.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.544
- Yeah.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.779
- Oh remind me after this, I
gotta talk to you about Friday.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.415
- I'm so looking
forward to that.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.176

10:45.178 --> 10:46.344

10:47.547 --> 10:49.481

11:31.958 --> 11:33.525
- Those teachers
were so talented.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.960
- I know, they were so
much more talented than

11:35.962 --> 11:37.295
our six-year-olds.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.731
Thank God they showed
us that, right?

11:39.733 --> 11:41.900
Do you think they're also
better at holding their alcohol

11:41.902 --> 11:43.435
and driving?

11:43.437 --> 11:44.769
- Just feel bad for the
poor fuschias that had to

11:44.771 --> 11:46.337
follow them with Feliz Navidad.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.806
- You know what, maybe we can
get the teachers to sing that

11:47.808 --> 11:49.174
once we can hear how it's
really supposed to go.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.275
- Little private concert?

11:50.277 --> 11:53.812
- (gasps) There she is, my girl!

11:53.814 --> 11:56.381
Oh my God, you were so good.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.315
Did you have fun?

11:57.317 --> 11:58.783
- These are for you, monkey.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.684
- Thank you!

11:59.686 --> 12:01.052
- Awe.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.587
- Mommy, you wore
your new shoes.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.655
- Of course I did.

12:03.657 --> 12:04.656
I promised I would.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.224
This is a fancy day.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.193
- And this is something
from me, tootsie roll.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.127
- What!

12:09.129 --> 12:10.562
Grammy's getting presents.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.396
- An iPad!

12:12.632 --> 12:14.132
Thank you, Grammy!

12:15.001 --> 12:16.835
- You gave her an iPad?

12:16.837 --> 12:17.769
- It's my old one.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.237
I hardly use it anymore.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.171
- Oh my God.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.606
- You were wonderful.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.141
- There's gonna be some
rules with that, OK?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.742
- Yeah.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.211
- Let's head out to the car.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.846
You did a great job, boo.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.815
(upbeat music)

12:30.817 --> 12:32.584
My mom completely [Bleep] us.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.919
- Yeah and it wasn't
even a Christmas present.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.088
It was a gift for singing
in a holiday show.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.191
- I mean, if she performed
like one of the teachers,

12:40.193 --> 12:43.461
ya know, maybe I
could understand.

12:43.463 --> 12:48.266
Did you see the pure joy that
washed over our child's face?

12:49.302 --> 12:50.535
- It was hard to watch.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.804
- We can't even take
the iPad away now

12:52.806 --> 12:54.139
'cause she wouldn't know why.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.707
She would just think
we were being assholes.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.076
I plan on giving her a
lot more reasons to think

12:58.078 --> 13:00.178
we're assholes in the future,
so I don't wanna just burn

13:00.180 --> 13:01.646
through those all now.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.781
- If our child just assumes
things magically appear,

13:03.783 --> 13:05.116
then she wants
without a price tag.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.452
- Just honestly,
it's making me crazy.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.054
I think we need to like
maybe give her an allowance

13:10.056 --> 13:12.157
and start having her
pay for some shit.

13:12.159 --> 13:16.327
Show her there's a price to
pay for her thirsty capitalism.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.762
- I'm on board with that.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.231
- I really wish we could
cancel this massage tomorrow.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.834
But ugh, I can't
do that to my mom

13:22.836 --> 13:26.371
even though she was an
insensitive ass [Bleep] today.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.773
- She is so excited that
it's all she talked about

13:28.775 --> 13:29.974
before you showed up.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.976
- She loves spending
time with her daughter.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.178
I get it.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.947
The spa thing is just
stressing me out.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.116
- How are you stressed
out about a spa?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.218
- Because apparently I'm
gonna see my mom's puss.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.452
- What?

13:41.454 --> 13:44.222
- Yeah and maybe all
the pusses there.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.490
- Oh God.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.791
- I just don't know
what the rules are

13:46.793 --> 13:48.293
and it gives me anxiety.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.196
I'm fine being naked
but am I supposed to be

13:51.198 --> 13:52.564
naked right away?

13:52.566 --> 13:54.432
Do I wear a suit and
then take that off

13:54.434 --> 13:56.034
at some specific spot?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.535
What's everyone else
gonna be wearing?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.304
- I don't really know but
anytime I've ever gone,

13:59.306 --> 14:01.639
a lot of people are nude.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.141
- Great.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.911
I guess it's just gonna
be me and my mom nude

14:09.082 --> 14:10.548
all morning.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.084
- Well, I can imagine that's
gonna help you with your sleep.

14:13.086 --> 14:16.020
- Not unless I suddenly become
attracted to my mom's puss.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.290
- (sighs) Now I'm not
gonna be able to sleep.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.492
- Too aroused, I get it.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.827
- No.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.497
- OK, you could do worse
than my mom's puss.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.499
Why would you make me
say something like that?

14:29.903 --> 14:31.903
And around the holidays?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.507
(jazzy music)

14:36.509 --> 14:38.109
Alright, I gotta drop
Amelia off at camp

14:38.111 --> 14:40.845
'cause I gotta get to the nudist
colony with my mom by 8:30.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.247
- Mm mm.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.448
- Don't mm mm me.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.350
No, I am a very funny person.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.185
You're very lucky to be with me.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.187
- I agree with all of that.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.088
- Really?

14:50.090 --> 14:50.922
- [Mike] Yes.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.156
- Wow.

14:52.158 --> 14:52.824
- And you know who else
would agree with you.

14:52.826 --> 14:53.658
Julie from work.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.059
- Well, well, well.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.561
Was there a specific
example of my comedic genius

14:56.563 --> 14:59.597
or just like this was a blanket
observation of my gifts?

14:59.599 --> 15:01.933
- We were in lunch and
I told her about how you

15:01.935 --> 15:04.002
bumped into that guy you
forgot you had sex with.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.303
She thought it was hysterical.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.238
- Uh, that was not the story.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.806
- Yeah, it was.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.709
- No, Mike, the story was
I bumped into a guy who

15:11.711 --> 15:14.579
I'd forgotten about
that I had sex with.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.047
- How is that different
than what I said?

15:16.049 --> 15:18.082
- You said that I bumped
into a guy that I forgot

15:18.084 --> 15:19.550
I had sex with.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.354
That makes it sound like
I'm like a crazy sex maniac

15:23.356 --> 15:27.325
who's just like had
sex with 1,000 people.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.826
- I don't think that's true.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.795
- Mike, how many people would
I have had to have sex with

15:30.797 --> 15:34.966
to forget that someone
had been inside my body?

15:34.968 --> 15:37.769
I remember every single
person who's been inside me.

15:37.771 --> 15:41.172
Wish my numbers were higher,
but they're not, alright?

15:41.174 --> 15:43.374
- Why do you wish your
numbers were higher?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.310
- Because that would mean
I'd really lived a life.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.247
- OK but I guarantee that
wasn't Julie's takeaway.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.616
There's no world where
that was not her takeaway.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.851
I am going to now
have to email Julie.

15:53.853 --> 15:54.752
- OK.

15:54.754 --> 15:55.987
- I gotta go.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.555
I'll tell my mom's
puss you say hi.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.823
- Please don't.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.225
- If it says hi first,
I'm not gonna be rude.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.729
- Yeah, don't be
rude to your mom's--

16:04.731 --> 16:06.664
- You were gonna say puss.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.066
- Uh, nope.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.735
- You almost said my mom's puss.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.036
- Yeah, I almost did.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.771
- I love you so much.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.140
(giggling)

16:16.142 --> 16:18.643
(light music)

16:20.313 --> 16:21.979
Mom, I can't comprehend
why you thought it was OK

16:21.981 --> 16:25.016
to give her an iPad
without asking us first.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.250
- It was my old one.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.652
I just had it in the
back of my closet.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.420
- She doesn't know the
difference and we're trying to

16:29.422 --> 16:31.222
teach her the value of money.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.457
- Oh, come on.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.225
- No, now, she wants
an expensive gift.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.160
Few days later,
here comes Grammy.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.229
She didn't have to
earn it or anything.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.697
- She sang Jingle Bells?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.733
- Yeah, that was no Go
Tell It On The Mountain.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.102
- I just think you're making
such a big deal outta this.

16:44.104 --> 16:44.936
- OK fine.

16:53.880 --> 16:54.712
- Oh!

16:56.983 --> 16:57.982
Look at you.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.352
- Is that a new suit?

17:01.354 --> 17:02.920
- Mmhmm.

17:02.922 --> 17:03.921
- I like it.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.562
(jazzy music)

17:17.871 --> 17:19.103
- I'm getting kinda hot.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.539
You wanna go sit
in the quiet room?

17:21.541 --> 17:25.410
- No, you know what, I think
I'll probably just hang here.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.978
Maybe hit the sauna.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.713
- You sure?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.982
- Yeah, as ya know polite
society can attest to

17:30.984 --> 17:33.151
being quiet is not my jam.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.254
- Well, that's true.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.456
Alright, I'll meet you
in the massage then.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.091
- Perfect, great.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.259
See ya later.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.661
- You look great, by the way.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.431
- Thank you.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.402
(jazzy music)

17:55.341 --> 17:57.341
(sighs)

18:01.981 --> 18:04.215
(exhaling)

18:24.170 --> 18:25.770
- [Woman] Andrea?

18:25.772 --> 18:26.904
- Beth!

18:26.906 --> 18:28.039
Oh my God.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.607
- Hi! What are you doing here?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.009
I mean, I guess I know
what you're doing here.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.846
- Yeah, I never even
have been here before.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.414
- Oh my God, I come
here all the time.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.648
It's a best kept secret.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.184
- I was given a
gift certificate.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.753
- Oh, that was a good friend.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.021
- Yeah, yeah.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.456
- How's your break going?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.491
Are you guys traveling?

18:46.493 --> 18:47.658
Are you staying here?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.795
- Uh, not traveling,
staying here.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.263
Staying here, yeah.
- Good, good, lucky.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.266
- Yeah, yeah, no,
it's been just working

18:55.268 --> 18:57.702
and um, what are you guys doing?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.470
- We're heading to Cincinnati.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.972
That's where Tim's
family is from.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.507
But they don't believe in WiFi,

19:02.509 --> 19:04.141
so it's gonna be a long week.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.810
Yeah.
- Great, great.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.380
- Lots of songs around campfires
and that sort of thing.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.715
- Oh, maybe fun.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.918
Well, good.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.822
- Yeah, I'll let you
get back to your sweat,

19:17.824 --> 19:19.524
but it was so good to see you.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.791
- You too!

19:20.793 --> 19:21.926
- You have a great holiday.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.394
- I will, it's been nice to--

19:23.396 --> 19:24.328
yes, mmhmm.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.232
- Thanks.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.568
- Uh huh, bye.
- Bye!

19:30.570 --> 19:31.769
- Good to see you.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.604
- [Beth] Ditto.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.107
(jazzy music)

19:37.577 --> 19:38.943
- [Mother] You put
a bathing suit on.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.177
- Yes, I did.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.948
I just experienced an
areola to areola hug

19:43.950 --> 19:46.484
with a mom I see
every day at drop off.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.818
- Oh Jesus.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.587
- Yeah, oh my God.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.856
(groaning)

20:12.545 --> 20:15.179
OK, you've gotta be shitting me.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.181
- I'm confused.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.449
How was that relaxing.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.951
- To be clear, it was not.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.219
But my mom's moaning
was so aggressive

20:22.221 --> 20:24.922
that we were forced to move
into another massage room

20:24.924 --> 20:27.758
and there, I was able to
get quite a pleasant massage

20:27.760 --> 20:29.527
and I fell asleep
halfway through.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.729
Since the room wasn't
booked, they let me sleep

20:31.731 --> 20:33.230
for two hours.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.332
- That sounds like
what you needed.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.533
- It was!

20:35.535 --> 20:36.968
Then the day just got
better from there.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.502
Rob and I got a ton of work done

20:38.504 --> 20:42.073
and I got an email back from
your friend, Julie, at work.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.608
- Really?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.543
- Uh huh, she said that she
had misunderstood the story

20:45.545 --> 20:50.014
and was quote, relieved to find
out that I am not a harlot.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.582
- I'm glad that got cleared up.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.818
- I'm thrilled, thank you!

20:53.820 --> 20:55.119
- Do you like my snowflakes?

20:55.121 --> 20:57.722
- Bugs, those are awesome!

20:57.724 --> 20:58.990
Wow!

20:58.992 --> 21:01.459
Feel like it's snowing
in Los Angeles, boo!

21:01.461 --> 21:03.928
- Mommy, can I have a phone?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.330
- Can you get a phone?

21:06.332 --> 21:07.565
No!

21:07.567 --> 21:09.333
- But you could
just get a new one

21:09.335 --> 21:11.068
and give me your old one.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.403
- Oh my gosh.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.905
- I'm sorry, I tried
to explain it to her.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.407
That's not how things work.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.875
- Uh huh.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.610
You know what Bugs, we're
actually gonna start

21:19.612 --> 21:21.879
giving you some chores
to do around the house

21:21.881 --> 21:23.347
and we're gonna give
you an allowance.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.882
$2 a week.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.117
- Really?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.351
- Yeah but you
gotta work for it.

21:27.353 --> 21:28.619
And you gotta start
paying for some things.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.121
So if you wanna download
a song and it's like $2,

21:30.123 --> 21:32.790
you're gonna have to work
a whole week for that song.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.227
- So, I want you to be prepared
to have to work very hard

21:36.229 --> 21:37.995
for the things that
you wanna buy, OK?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.930
You understand
what we're saying?

21:39.932 --> 21:42.433
- You mean how you worked hard
to pay for those new shoes?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.734
- Mmhmm.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.569
- They were probably $10.

21:45.571 --> 21:50.174
- Uh huh and I had to work
very hard to earn those $10.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.745
That's a lot of money.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.080
- She did.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.548
- Uh huh.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.750
- Alright, let's go empty the
trash cans in the bathroom

21:59.752 --> 22:00.685
'cause that's your new chore.

22:00.687 --> 22:01.519
Come on.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.353
- [Amelia] OK!

22:02.355 --> 22:03.187
- That's a good chore!

22:03.189 --> 22:04.355
I like that one.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.691
- So that's what
we're doing now?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.659
We're just lying to her
about how much things cost?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.161
- Yep.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.662
- And are you aware you
told her that she can buy

22:11.664 --> 22:14.465
new rag and bone boots for
five weeks of allowance?

22:14.467 --> 22:17.835
- Are you aware that you
gave her a god damn iPad?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.403
- Yeah.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.372
- Yeah, turn away.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.541
You know what you did.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.376
(jazzy music)

22:25.378 --> 22:26.277
- Alright, it's sent.

22:26.279 --> 22:27.411
Out of our hands now.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.679
- Oh my God.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.015
Is this what
vacation feels like?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.983
Ugh, now does this mean
I have to start working

22:32.985 --> 22:33.818
with Kyle again?

22:33.820 --> 22:35.286
Barf.

22:35.288 --> 22:36.821
- Well I mean, she could write
back and say she hates it

22:36.823 --> 22:38.089
and we have to start over.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.390
- You know what?

22:39.392 --> 22:40.624
I love that positive attitude.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.559
- HIV positive.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.560
- Oh, good one.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.661
HIV positive.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.495
That's great.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.496
Happy holidays.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.564
I'm getting a to go cup.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.465
Do you want anything?

22:47.467 --> 22:49.567
- Nah, I'm good.
- Alright.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.604
Noah, hey!

22:53.606 --> 22:55.573
- Oh, hey, good
to see you again!

22:55.575 --> 22:56.874
- You too!

22:56.876 --> 22:58.943
Hey, were your ears
burning last week?

22:58.945 --> 23:00.411
- No, why?

23:00.413 --> 23:02.279
- Well, I told my husband
that I bumped into you

23:02.281 --> 23:04.648
and that we had hooked
up back in the day.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.016
He was a little jealous I think.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.118
It was kinda fun.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.353
- Um, we never hooked up.

23:09.355 --> 23:13.657
We just lived in the
same building on Orange.

23:13.659 --> 23:14.492
- Oh shit.

23:15.795 --> 23:16.627
Noah.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.462
- Yes.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.396
- Right!

23:19.398 --> 23:20.331
You lived with Vanessa.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.232
- Yeah!

23:21.234 --> 23:22.166
Still together.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.100
- Oh my God!

23:23.102 --> 23:24.268
- Yeah, married.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.503
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.638
- Um, if you ever
meet my husband,

23:27.640 --> 23:30.141
if you could not mention this.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.243
- How is that gonna come up?

23:32.245 --> 23:34.044
- I think there's a
pretty high chance, yeah.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.046
- I will not mention it.

23:36.048 --> 23:36.981
- Thank you.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.249
Good to see you.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.050
- Good, great to see you.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.752
- Bye.
- Bye!

23:41.754 --> 23:44.255
(light music)

23:46.826 --> 23:47.758
- Honey.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.993
- You're still up?

23:48.995 --> 23:50.661
- Well, I got you
a little something.

23:50.663 --> 23:54.298
Just a small I'm sorry for
everything to do with the iPad.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.333
- Mom, thank you.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.902
You didn't have to do that.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.270
What is this?

23:59.272 --> 24:00.404
- Wind it up.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.673
(clicking)

24:05.111 --> 24:06.977
- Santa [Bleep] a pig.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.612
- Yeah!

24:08.614 --> 24:10.481
- Mom, Merry Christmas.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.516
- Merry Christmas, honey.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.684
- Thank you.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.286
- It reminded me of you.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.520
- The pig or Santa?

24:16.522 --> 24:17.521
- The pig!

24:17.523 --> 24:18.989
- That's what I was gonna say.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.724
They just look so happy.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.092
- I know, do it again.

24:22.395 --> 24:24.862
aughing)

24:24.864 --> 24:26.430
- I love Christmas.
