00:59.551 --> 01:01.451
<i>I walked with a zombie.</i>

01:02.987 --> 01:05.649
<i>It does seem an odd thing to say.</i>

01:05.723 --> 01:07.588
<i>Had anyone said that to me a year ago...</i>

01:07.659 --> 01:10.423
<i>I'm not at all sure</i>
<i>I would have known what a zombie was.</i>

01:10.495 --> 01:13.089
<i>I might have had some notion...</i>

01:13.164 --> 01:15.359
<i>that they were strange and frightening...</i>

01:15.533 --> 01:17.501
<i>even a little funny.</i>

01:17.836 --> 01:20.464
<i>It all began in such an ordinary way.</i>

01:20.738 --> 01:22.729
- You're single?
- Yes.

01:22.807 --> 01:26.402
- Where were you trained?
- Memorial Hospital here in Ottawa.

01:27.812 --> 01:31.213
Now this last question is a little irregular,
Miss Connell.

01:31.316 --> 01:34.046
I really don't know quite how to begin.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.385
Do you believe in witchcraft?

01:36.521 --> 01:37.545
Well...

01:38.957 --> 01:41.255
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital...

01:41.326 --> 01:44.056
but I had my suspicions
about the Directress of Training.

01:44.128 --> 01:46.153
Now, as to salary, it's quite good.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.563
- $200 a month.
- That is good.

01:48.633 --> 01:50.863
But I'd like to know a little bit more
about the case.

01:50.935 --> 01:52.800
I'm afraid I can't tell you much...

01:52.871 --> 01:55.431
only that the patient is the wife
of Mr. Paul Holland...

01:55.506 --> 01:57.235
with whom we do considerable business.

01:57.308 --> 02:00.573
- That will mean another interview?
- No, this is quite final.

02:00.645 --> 02:02.670
You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.011
He lives on Saint Sebastian
in the West Indies.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.550
The West Indies?

02:06.618 --> 02:10.247
That's not so bad, sit under a palm tree...

02:10.854 --> 02:13.688
go swimming, take sunbaths.

02:15.226 --> 02:16.750
Palm trees.

02:30.708 --> 02:34.610
<i>It seemed only a few days</i>
<i>before I met Mr. Holland in Antigua.</i>

02:34.679 --> 02:37.341
<i>We boarded the boat for Saint Sebastian.</i>

02:37.415 --> 02:39.906
<i>It was all just as I had imagined it.</i>

02:39.984 --> 02:42.475
<i>I looked at those great glowing stars.</i>

02:42.553 --> 02:45.078
<i>I felt the warm wind on my cheek.</i>

02:45.156 --> 02:49.183
<i>I breathed deep</i>
<i>and every bit of me inside myself said:</i>

02:49.761 --> 02:51.228
<i>"How beautiful."</i>

02:51.329 --> 02:52.660
It's not beautiful!

02:55.433 --> 02:57.663
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.

02:57.735 --> 03:00.295
It's easy enough to read the thoughts
of a newcomer.

03:00.371 --> 03:03.340
Everything seems beautiful
because you don't understand.

03:03.408 --> 03:04.670
Those flying fish...

03:04.742 --> 03:07.905
they are not leaping for joy.
They're jumping in terror.

03:08.112 --> 03:10.171
Bigger fish want to eat them.

03:10.548 --> 03:12.539
That luminous water...

03:12.617 --> 03:15.848
it takes its gleam
from millions of tiny dead bodies.

03:16.254 --> 03:18.586
The glitter of putrescence.

03:20.725 --> 03:24.126
There's no beauty here,
only death and decay.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.725
You can't really believe that.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.128
Everything good dies here, even the stars.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.776
<i>It was strange to have him break in</i>
<i>on my thoughts that way.</i>

03:43.848 --> 03:46.749
<i>There was cruelty and hardness</i>
<i>in his voice.</i>

03:46.951 --> 03:49.442
<i>And yet something about him I liked.</i>

03:49.620 --> 03:52.088
<i>Something clean and honest...</i>

03:52.156 --> 03:54.920
<i>but hurt, badly hurt.</i>

04:21.586 --> 04:25.113
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort.
And now, no longer.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.022
The Hollands
was the most old family, miss.

04:29.093 --> 04:31.561
They brought the colored folks
to the island...

04:31.629 --> 04:33.927
the colored folks and Ti-Misery.

04:34.032 --> 04:35.829
Ti-Misery? What's that?

04:35.900 --> 04:40.360
A man, miss. An old man who lives
in the garden at Fort Holland.

04:40.471 --> 04:44.532
With arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful,
weeping look on his black face.

04:44.609 --> 04:45.837
Alive?

04:45.910 --> 04:49.243
No, miss, he's just the same as he was
in the beginning...

04:49.313 --> 04:51.679
on the front side of an enormous boat.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.547
- You mean a figurehead.
- If you say, miss.

04:54.619 --> 04:57.747
And the enormous boat
brought the long-ago fathers...

04:57.822 --> 05:02.350
and the long-ago mothers of us all,
chained to the bottom of the boat.

05:03.661 --> 05:06.289
They brought you to a beautiful place,
didn't they?

05:06.364 --> 05:08.730
If you say, miss. If you say.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.072
<i>Fort Holland.</i>

05:24.348 --> 05:27.215
<i>From the gate,</i>
<i>it seemed strangely dreamlike.</i>

05:27.285 --> 05:29.310
<i>The garden had life of its own.</i>

05:29.387 --> 05:32.618
<i>I was to know all the nooks and crannies</i>
<i>of that great house...</i>

05:32.690 --> 05:36.490
<i>to love them or hate them,</i>
<i>according to what happened there.</i>

05:36.561 --> 05:39.792
<i>In that house,</i>
<i>I was to hear a strange confession...</i>

05:39.864 --> 05:44.062
<i>a confession only madness could have</i>
<i>wrung from the lips of a sane person.</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:46.262
<i>And yet it was in the same room...</i>

05:46.337 --> 05:50.205
<i>with the candles lit, that I made</i>
<i>the discovery of my own love...</i>

05:50.274 --> 05:52.765
<i>knew happiness, deep through the heart.</i>

05:53.644 --> 05:55.305
<i>My room...</i>

05:55.413 --> 05:59.406
<i>I still can remember my delight,</i>
<i>unpacking, getting ready for dinner.</i>

05:59.484 --> 06:02.976
<i>Yet, all the while,</i>
<i>I wondered at the stillness of Fort Holland.</i>

06:03.054 --> 06:06.922
<i>The fact that I saw no one</i>
<i>on the garden paths or in the rooms.</i>

06:14.265 --> 06:15.323
Yes?

06:15.399 --> 06:18.232
- Miss Connell, it's dinner.
- Thank you.

06:29.247 --> 06:30.839
- Miss Connell?
- Yes.

06:30.915 --> 06:34.146
I'm Wesley Rand.
Paul wanted me to introduce myself.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.351
It seems we're dining by ourselves,
Miss Connell.

06:37.421 --> 06:39.719
But I think I'll introduce you
to everyone anyway.

06:39.790 --> 06:43.419
Here in the master's chair, sits the master,
my half-brother, Paul Holland.

06:43.494 --> 06:44.756
But you've met him already.

06:44.829 --> 06:46.421
Yes, on the boat.

06:47.765 --> 06:51.098
That chair in the corner
is the particular property of Mrs. Rand...

06:51.169 --> 06:53.694
mother to both of us
and much too good for either of us...

06:53.771 --> 06:55.864
too wise, in fact,
to live under the same roof.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.773
- She prefers the village dispensary.
- She's a doctor?

06:58.843 --> 07:00.606
No, she just runs the place.

07:00.678 --> 07:03.442
She does everything else, though.
An amazing woman. You'd like her.

07:03.514 --> 07:05.141
I like her already.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.652
That's my chair,
and this is Miss Connell, who is beautiful.

07:08.753 --> 07:10.050
Thank you.

07:10.121 --> 07:11.611
Who sits there?

07:12.356 --> 07:13.880
My brother's wife.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.286
Here, this isn't cozy at all.

07:17.428 --> 07:20.397
Makes me seem aloof,
and I'm anything but that.

07:23.534 --> 07:25.058
But you are an American.

07:25.136 --> 07:27.900
I went to school in Buffalo.
Paul went to school in England.

07:27.972 --> 07:30.372
I wondered about your different accents.

07:30.441 --> 07:33.638
I'm still wondering about your names,
Rand and Holland.

07:33.811 --> 07:35.574
We're half-brothers.

07:35.646 --> 07:37.637
Paul is Mother's first child.

07:37.715 --> 07:41.515
When his father died, she married
my father, Dr. Rand, the missionary.

07:49.126 --> 07:52.152
The jungle drums, mysterious, eerie.

07:54.832 --> 07:57.062
That's the work drum
over at the sugar mill.

07:57.134 --> 07:59.329
Saint Sebastian's version
of the factory whistle.

07:59.403 --> 08:02.270
It means that the sugar syrup
is about ready to be poured.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.035
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.439
Of course.

08:05.509 --> 08:07.807
It was nice of you
to spend this much time with me.

08:07.878 --> 08:11.314
Don't worry, I wasn't missed. The only
important man around here is the owner.

08:11.382 --> 08:13.850
- Mr. Holland?
- Yes, the redoubtable Paul.

08:13.918 --> 08:16.785
He has the plantation, and I, as you
must have noticed, have the charm.

08:16.854 --> 08:20.654
I don't know. He spoke to me on the boat
last night, and I liked him very much.

08:20.725 --> 08:22.818
Yes, our Paul...

08:23.294 --> 08:26.161
strong and silent and very sad...

08:26.230 --> 08:28.198
quite the Byronic character.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.931
Maybe I should cultivate it.

08:31.235 --> 08:34.135
- Maybe you ought to go to the mill.
- It'll wait.

08:41.712 --> 08:43.839
I was just going to the mill.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.542
- Good night, Miss Connell.
- Good night.

08:47.785 --> 08:50.948
- Have the servants made you comfortable?
- Yes, thank you.

08:51.522 --> 08:54.150
Looks very nice, Clement.
I'll take it to Mrs. Holland.

08:54.225 --> 08:56.022
- Can't I take it for you?
- No, thank you.

08:56.093 --> 08:58.721
Tomorrow's soon enough
for you to start work.

11:34.251 --> 11:35.411
Mrs. Holland.

11:43.294 --> 11:44.761
Mrs. Holland?

11:55.039 --> 11:56.370
Mrs. Holland.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.638
Mrs. Holland?

12:07.785 --> 12:10.618
I didn't mean to get you up, Mrs. Holland.

12:11.755 --> 12:12.744
Mrs. Holland.

12:36.747 --> 12:38.374
Jessica!

12:44.054 --> 12:46.215
Take Mrs. Holland to her room, Alma.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.855
Come, Miss Jessica. Come with Alma.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.055
I heard someone crying, a woman.

12:52.129 --> 12:55.496
A woman crying?
There's been no crying here.

12:55.799 --> 12:58.267
Mr. Paul, yes, there was crying tonight.

12:58.335 --> 13:01.031
It was Alma,
her sister was brought a-birthing.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.638
Thank you, Clement.

13:21.859 --> 13:25.090
Clement, I'm going to stay
with Miss Jessica...

13:25.162 --> 13:27.687
in case the nurse lady
takes to roaming again.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.734
Don't you go crying anymore.
That's what frightened Miss Betsy.

13:30.801 --> 13:34.168
She didn't soothe me any,
hollering around in the tower.

13:37.074 --> 13:39.133
Why was the maid crying?

13:39.243 --> 13:41.575
I'm not sure I can make you understand.

13:41.645 --> 13:43.374
Do you know what this is?

13:44.014 --> 13:46.881
- A figure of Saint Sebastian.
- Yes.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.215
But it was once the figurehead
of a slave ship.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.254
That's where our people came from...

13:51.322 --> 13:53.517
from the misery and pain of slavery.

13:53.591 --> 13:55.957
For generations, they found life a burden.

13:56.026 --> 14:00.156
That's why they still weep when a child
is born and make merry at a burial.

14:04.001 --> 14:07.164
I've told you, Miss Connell,
this is a sad place.

14:25.522 --> 14:27.353
Good morning, miss.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.721
Thank you for waking me.

14:29.793 --> 14:32.489
I didn't want to frighten you
out of your sleep, miss.

14:32.563 --> 14:35.396
That's why I touched you
farthest from your heart.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.225
Don't get up, miss.
I brought your breakfast...

14:39.336 --> 14:41.167
just like I do for Miss Jessica.

14:41.238 --> 14:44.435
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma.
You don't have to do that for me.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.373
I know it, miss, but I like to do it.

14:46.443 --> 14:49.674
I like to tend for Miss Jessica,
and I want to tend for you.

14:49.747 --> 14:52.807
You settle right back now,
and I'll mix you your coffee.

14:52.883 --> 14:54.407
Thank you.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.749
Miss Jessica used to say
this is the only way...

14:57.821 --> 14:59.516
for a lady to break her fast...

14:59.590 --> 15:02.718
in bed, with a lacy cushion
to bank her head on.

15:02.793 --> 15:05.489
If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell.

15:05.663 --> 15:07.460
She looked so pretty.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.590
She must have been beautiful.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.464
What happened to her, Alma?

15:11.535 --> 15:14.629
She was very sick,
and then she went mindless, miss.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.202
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma,
you and I.

15:19.276 --> 15:20.607
I do my best.

15:20.678 --> 15:24.512
Every day I dress her just as beautifully
as if she was well.

15:24.615 --> 15:27.243
It's just like dressing a great big doll.

15:28.819 --> 15:30.184
What's this?

15:30.254 --> 15:33.485
A puffup, I call it.
But Miss Jessica always says <i>brioche.</i>

15:33.557 --> 15:34.922
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast.

15:34.992 --> 15:37.017
I don't know
whether I'll be able to get away with it.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.598
I made it clear
in my letter to the company...

15:41.665 --> 15:43.690
this is not a position for a frightened girl.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.132
I am not a frightened girl.

15:45.202 --> 15:47.636
That's hard to believe
after what happened last night.

15:47.705 --> 15:49.764
If I were as timid as you seem to think,
Mr. Holland...

15:49.840 --> 15:52.104
I wouldn't have gone to the tower
in the first place.

15:53.277 --> 15:56.440
And what's so alarming about the tower,
Miss Connell?

15:56.647 --> 15:58.205
Nothing really.

15:58.315 --> 16:01.751
But you must admit
it's an eerie sort of place, so dark.

16:01.819 --> 16:03.844
Surely, nurses aren't afraid of the dark?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.183
Of course not.

16:06.190 --> 16:09.159
I used to be afraid of the dark
when I was a child.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.352
But I'm not afraid anymore.

16:14.531 --> 16:18.490
Frankly, it was something of a shock to
see my patient that way for the first time.

16:18.569 --> 16:21.732
Nobody had told me
Mrs. Holland was a mental case.

16:24.742 --> 16:26.141
A mental case?

16:26.210 --> 16:28.269
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be?

16:28.345 --> 16:30.370
My wife is a mental case.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.613
Please remember that, Miss Connell...

16:33.684 --> 16:36.517
particularly when some
of the foolish people on the island...

16:36.587 --> 16:38.555
start regaling you with local legends.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.523
You'll find superstition a contagious thing.

16:41.725 --> 16:44.216
Some people let it get the better of them.

16:45.362 --> 16:48.263
- I don't think you will.
- No.

16:49.867 --> 16:53.132
Come along. I'll introduce you
to Dr. Maxwell and your patient.

16:54.204 --> 16:56.672
I can't tell you how glad I am
to have you here, Miss Connell.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.640
I know I'll enjoy working with you, Doctor.

16:58.709 --> 17:02.201
I have an enormous respect for nurses,
but most of them scare me.

17:02.312 --> 17:06.146
I always feel them behind my back,
looking at their training manuals...

17:06.215 --> 17:08.012
counting my mistakes.

17:08.085 --> 17:09.814
I'll keep tabs on you.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.119
She makes a beautiful zombie,
doesn't she?

17:14.191 --> 17:17.455
- It's pitiful.
- I knew Jessica. We were friends.

17:17.528 --> 17:19.553
Sometimes it's better for a doctor
to laugh...

17:19.630 --> 17:21.825
than pull a long face
when things are hopeless.

17:21.898 --> 17:23.388
Yes, I know.

17:24.935 --> 17:28.632
But I don't know about zombies, Doctor.
Just what is a zombie?

17:29.239 --> 17:32.697
A ghost, a living dead. It's also a drink.

17:32.776 --> 17:35.677
Yes, I tried one once,
but there wasn't anything dead about it.

17:35.746 --> 17:38.806
But we have a more serious problem
to deal with, Miss Connell.

17:38.882 --> 17:41.112
You want to know about your patient,
don't you?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.379
Please.

17:42.953 --> 17:44.978
I'll try to put it simply.

17:45.222 --> 17:47.315
Mrs. Holland had a tropical fever...

17:47.391 --> 17:48.722
very severe.

17:49.126 --> 17:53.222
We might say that portions of the
spinal cord were burned out by this fever.

17:53.764 --> 17:55.755
The result is what you see...

17:55.866 --> 17:57.857
a woman without any willpower...

17:57.935 --> 18:00.961
unable to speak or even act by herself.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.063
Though she will obey simple commands.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.574
- Does she suffer?
- I don't know.

18:05.709 --> 18:09.304
I'd rather think of her as a sleepwalker
who can never be awakened...

18:09.379 --> 18:11.779
feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

18:12.416 --> 18:15.681
There's very little we can do
except keep her physically comfortable...

18:15.752 --> 18:17.549
light diet, some exercise.

18:17.621 --> 18:19.612
She can never be cured?

18:19.790 --> 18:21.781
I've never heard of a cure.

18:22.759 --> 18:26.126
Could you give me some details
of treatment and diet?

18:26.263 --> 18:29.323
- I prepared these for you last night.
- Thank you.

18:29.633 --> 18:33.262
I'll drop by in a day or so
to see how you are getting on.

18:38.775 --> 18:42.802
You didn't find your patient so frightening
in the daylight, did you?

18:42.880 --> 18:45.178
Mrs. Holland must have been
very beautiful.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.342
Many people thought her beautiful.

18:49.453 --> 18:52.718
Tell me, Miss Connell,
do you consider yourself pretty?

18:53.223 --> 18:55.657
I don't know. I suppose so.

18:55.726 --> 18:57.125
And charming?

18:57.194 --> 18:59.594
- I've never given it much thought.
- Don't.

18:59.663 --> 19:01.961
You'll save yourself
a great deal of trouble...

19:02.032 --> 19:04.432
and other people
a great deal of unhappiness.

19:28.425 --> 19:31.519
- Betsy, where are you going?
- It's my day off.

19:31.595 --> 19:33.893
What in the world can you do
with a day off in St. Sebastian?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.261
I was just beginning to wonder.

19:35.332 --> 19:37.630
Aren't there shops and restaurants
and things here?

19:37.701 --> 19:40.261
"And things" is a better description
of what you'll find.

19:40.337 --> 19:42.237
I'd better come along
and show you the town.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.603
Don't you have to work?

19:43.674 --> 19:46.666
By a curious coincidence,
it's my day off, too.

19:48.946 --> 19:53.474
<i>Some talk of Alexander</i>
<i>And some of Hercules</i>

19:53.917 --> 19:58.149
<i>Of Hector and Lysander</i>
<i>And such great names as these</i>

19:58.755 --> 20:02.088
<i>But of all the world's great heroes</i>
<i>There's none that</i>

20:02.326 --> 20:05.921
Ti-Joseph, better bring me another.
I have to keep the lady entertained.

20:05.996 --> 20:09.397
Must be hard work entertaining me
if it requires six ounces of rum.

20:09.466 --> 20:12.162
- Six ounces?
- Higher mathematics.

20:12.235 --> 20:14.430
Two ounces to a drink.
Three drinks, six ounces.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.699
How did you know there were two ounces
in a drink?

20:16.773 --> 20:19.537
I'm a nurse. I always watch people
when they pour something.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.772
I watched Ti-Joseph,
and it was exactly two ounces.

20:23.547 --> 20:25.447
<i>There was a family</i>

20:25.515 --> 20:30.350
<i>That lived on the isle of Saint Sebastian</i>
<i>A long, long while</i>

20:30.420 --> 20:33.412
<i>The head of the family was a Holland man</i>

20:33.490 --> 20:36.755
<i>And the younger brother</i>
<i>his name was Rand</i>

20:36.827 --> 20:37.919
<i>Ah, woe</i>

20:37.995 --> 20:41.863
Listen, did I ever tell you the story
about the little mule on the plantation?

20:41.932 --> 20:43.661
Wait a minute, I want to listen.

20:43.734 --> 20:46.794
<i>The Holland man, he kept in a tower</i>

20:46.870 --> 20:50.431
<i>A wife as pretty as a big, white flower</i>

20:50.507 --> 20:53.533
<i>She saw the brother</i>
<i>and she stole his heart</i>

20:53.610 --> 20:56.875
<i>And that's how the badness</i>
<i>and the trouble start.</i>

21:01.118 --> 21:04.519
Ti-Malice, you tripped up my tongue.
Why do you wish trouble me for?

21:04.588 --> 21:07.318
You saw Mr. Rand go in there.
Why don't you tell me?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.858
Apologize, that's what I'll do.

21:08.925 --> 21:12.224
Creep in just like a little fox,
and warm myself in his heart.

21:12.295 --> 21:15.890
I wouldn't have listened, Wesley,
if I'd realized I...

21:18.735 --> 21:21.932
- Mr. Rand, I've come to apologize.
- All right.

21:22.105 --> 21:24.073
It's just an old song
I picked up somewhere.

21:24.141 --> 21:26.905
- Don't know who did make it up.
- All right, all right.

21:26.977 --> 21:30.140
Some of these singers on this island,
they'd tattletale on anybody.

21:30.213 --> 21:34.343
Believe me, I never would sing that song
if I'd known you were with a lady.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.010
Get out of here!

21:38.021 --> 21:40.182
Don't let it bother you so, Wesley.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.258
You heard what he sang.

21:42.692 --> 21:43.989
Shocked?

21:44.361 --> 21:47.330
- I just wish I hadn't heard.
- Why?

21:47.397 --> 21:49.922
Everybody else knows it, Paul saw to that.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.060
Sometimes I think he planned
the whole thing from the beginning...

21:53.136 --> 21:54.660
just to watch me squirm.

21:54.738 --> 21:56.330
That doesn't sound like him.

21:56.406 --> 22:00.240
That's right, he's playing
the noble husband for you, isn't he?

22:00.777 --> 22:02.711
That won't last long.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.979
I think we'd better go now.
Will you take me home?

22:07.217 --> 22:10.584
One of these days he will start on you
just like he did on her.

22:10.654 --> 22:13.748
"You think life's beautiful,
don't you, Jessica?"

22:13.924 --> 22:17.087
"You think you're beautiful,
don't you, Jessica?"

22:18.061 --> 22:21.053
What he could do to that word "beautiful."

22:21.598 --> 22:23.998
That's Paul's great weapon, words.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.694
He uses them like other men use their fist.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.145
Wes, it's time we started home.

22:47.157 --> 22:50.820
<i>The wife and the brother, they want to go</i>

22:50.994 --> 22:54.953
<i>But the Holland man, he tell them no</i>

22:55.298 --> 22:58.392
<i>The wife fall down and the evil came</i>

22:58.468 --> 23:01.960
<i>And it burned her mind in the fever flame</i>

23:02.038 --> 23:05.007
Wes, we must get back to Fort Holland.

23:06.476 --> 23:09.604
<i>Shame and sorrow for the family</i>

23:09.980 --> 23:13.143
<i>Her eyes are empty and she cannot talk</i>

23:13.216 --> 23:16.777
<i>And a nurse has come to make her walk</i>

23:17.120 --> 23:20.385
<i>The brothers are Ionely</i>
<i>and the nurse is young</i>

23:20.624 --> 23:23.923
<i>And now you must see</i>
<i>that my song is sung</i>

23:24.127 --> 23:27.756
<i>Ah, woe, ah, me</i>

23:27.964 --> 23:30.990
<i>Shame and sorrow for the family</i>

23:31.334 --> 23:35.031
<i>Ah, woe, ah, me</i>

23:35.405 --> 23:38.932
<i>Shame and sorrow for the family</i>

23:40.777 --> 23:43.268
- I think you need some help.
- I'm afraid so.

23:44.014 --> 23:45.447
Ti-Joseph...

23:46.516 --> 23:49.417
get Mr. Rand onto his horse
and start him toward the Fort.

23:49.486 --> 23:51.044
But he's in no condition to ride.

23:51.121 --> 23:53.112
I don't think he could even sit
in the saddle.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.714
Don't worry about a sugar planter.

23:54.791 --> 23:58.090
Give him a horse,
and he'll ride to his own funeral.

24:01.798 --> 24:05.757
I really intended going out to the Fort
and meeting you long before this.

24:06.036 --> 24:08.368
I'm Mrs. Rand, Wesley's mother.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.766
Mrs. Rand...

24:09.839 --> 24:13.434
Now don't tell me you're sorry
that I should meet you this way.

24:13.510 --> 24:16.911
I'm even a little glad that
Wesley's difficulties brought us together.

24:16.980 --> 24:19.175
Believe me, he doesn't do this often. It's...

24:19.249 --> 24:22.776
Nonsense. I know Wesley's been drinking
too much lately.

24:23.019 --> 24:27.456
I know a great deal more about
what goes on at the Fort than you'd think.

24:27.958 --> 24:30.085
I know all about you...

24:30.160 --> 24:32.492
that you're a nice girl, competent...

24:32.562 --> 24:34.655
and kind to Jessica.

24:34.731 --> 24:36.756
The Fort needs a girl like you.

24:37.367 --> 24:39.096
Come, I must get you back there.

24:39.169 --> 24:41.160
I'll walk back with you and stay the night.

24:41.238 --> 24:44.105
- The change will do me good.
- Thanks, Mrs. Rand.

24:44.541 --> 24:47.169
I think you're every bit as nice
as Wesley says you are.

24:47.244 --> 24:50.736
So, he says I'm nice.
He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell...

24:50.814 --> 24:52.441
a very nice boy.

24:53.183 --> 24:55.981
I'm worried about his drinking, though.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.754
You could do me a great favor.

24:58.822 --> 25:00.187
I'd love to.

25:00.257 --> 25:02.487
Use your influence with Paul.

25:02.559 --> 25:06.188
Ask him to take the whiskey decanter
off the dinner table.

25:06.263 --> 25:09.061
- I have no influence with Mr. Holland.
- Try it.

25:09.165 --> 25:11.531
You may have more than you think.

25:15.705 --> 25:19.539
No, it's not a drought, Bayard.
Rain's just a little late, that's all.

25:19.609 --> 25:21.702
I've seen the drought before, Mr. Holland.

25:21.778 --> 25:24.576
The cane is too dry,
and it's dangerous that way.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.513
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25:26.583 --> 25:30.417
I heard about your little misadventure
yesterday. On your first day off, too.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.786
- I had a good time up to a point.
- Wes can be very entertaining.

25:33.857 --> 25:36.348
Yes, he can. But I was wondering...

25:36.426 --> 25:39.122
you know, if you could leave
the whiskey decanter off the table...

25:39.195 --> 25:41.220
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.

25:41.298 --> 25:44.734
I can remember it
in my grandfather's time and my father's.

25:44.801 --> 25:47.668
But it must be an added temptation
to Wesley and...

25:47.737 --> 25:50.604
though your brother is not
an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland...

25:50.674 --> 25:52.835
I can tell you, as a nurse,
that it won't be long.

25:52.909 --> 25:56.868
Miss Connell, I engaged you to take care
of my wife, not my brother.

25:56.946 --> 26:00.382
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay
where it is.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.428
There they go.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.560
Bayard told me they were going
to ask Damballah for rain.

26:20.637 --> 26:22.332
The fields are as dry as dust.

26:22.405 --> 26:24.066
But what is it, Mr. Holland?

26:24.140 --> 26:26.267
It's a big seashell, a conch.

26:26.343 --> 26:30.177
They make a sort of bugle out of it
to call the faithful to the <i>houmfort.</i>

26:30.246 --> 26:32.544
But I don't know what a <i>houmfort</i> is
or a Damballah.

26:32.615 --> 26:34.879
It's voodoo. The <i>houmfort</i> is the temple...

26:34.951 --> 26:37.647
and Damballah is one of the gods,
the big papa god.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.279
You don't seem very disturbed by it.

26:39.356 --> 26:41.984
I thought voodoo was something
everyone was frightened of.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.026
I am afraid it's not very frightening.

26:44.094 --> 26:46.324
They sing and dance and carry on.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.160
And then, as I understand it,
one of the gods comes down...

26:49.232 --> 26:51.632
and speaks through one of the people.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.597
For some reason,
they always pick a night like this.

26:54.671 --> 26:57.105
This hot wind even sets me on edge.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.271
Clement, you've forgotten the decanter.

27:01.811 --> 27:05.645
I think from now on, Wes,
we'll try serving dinner without it.

27:06.116 --> 27:07.515
That's odd.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.212
What are you trying to do,
impress Miss Connell?

27:10.286 --> 27:12.777
You would make a better impression
without whiskey.

27:12.856 --> 27:13.880
Thank you.

27:13.957 --> 27:17.757
You've always had such tender concern
for me and for Jessica.

27:18.161 --> 27:20.254
- Let's drop it, Wes.
- Why?

27:21.164 --> 27:23.758
It isn't considered polite
to quarrel before ladies.

27:23.833 --> 27:27.200
I see, let's be reserved and gentlemanly.

27:28.138 --> 27:31.972
You were so reserved and gentlemanly,
so polite, that night with Jessica.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.702
- I remember...
- Wes!

27:38.148 --> 27:39.172
Miss Connell...

27:39.249 --> 27:44.152
I think it will be better if I had Clement
bring the rest of your dinner to your room.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.927
I heard you playing.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.765
I often do.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.633
I know what you went through tonight.

28:34.704 --> 28:36.899
I kept thinking of what you said...

28:36.973 --> 28:39.806
that all good things died here violently.

28:42.912 --> 28:44.641
Why did you come in here?

28:45.014 --> 28:46.504
I don't know.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.349
I wanted to help you.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.388
And now that I'm here, I don't know how.

28:52.455 --> 28:54.218
You have helped me.

28:55.391 --> 28:58.417
I want you to know
that I'm sorry I ever brought you here.

28:58.495 --> 29:02.659
When I thought of a nurse, I thought
of someone hard and impersonal.

29:04.234 --> 29:06.828
I love Fort Holland.

29:06.903 --> 29:08.768
And what you saw tonight...

29:08.838 --> 29:10.999
two brothers set against each other...

29:11.074 --> 29:13.065
and a woman driven mad
by her own husband...

29:13.142 --> 29:14.700
do you love that?

29:14.777 --> 29:16.506
You didn't drive her mad.

29:20.316 --> 29:24.218
Before Jessica was taken ill,
there was a scene...

29:25.788 --> 29:27.346
an ugly scene.

29:28.091 --> 29:29.888
I told her she couldn't go...

29:29.959 --> 29:32.894
that I'd keep her here by force,
if necessary.

29:34.497 --> 29:36.931
You never knew Jessica as she was.

29:41.504 --> 29:44.667
I think it would be best for all of us
not to discuss this again.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.437
Thank you. I know you meant to be kind.

29:59.188 --> 30:02.248
<i>I don't know how their own love</i>
<i>is revealed to other women.</i>

30:02.325 --> 30:05.021
<i>Maybe in their sweetheart's arms,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:05.161 --> 30:06.822
<i>To me it came that night...</i>

30:06.896 --> 30:09.763
<i>after Paul Holland had almost thrust me</i>
<i>from the room...</i>

30:09.866 --> 30:11.891
<i>certainly from his life.</i>

30:11.968 --> 30:14.027
<i>I said I love him.</i>

30:15.004 --> 30:18.235
<i>Even as I said it,</i>
<i>I knew he still loved his wife.</i>

30:19.375 --> 30:23.402
<i>And then, because I loved him,</i>
<i>I felt I had to restore her to him...</i>

30:23.780 --> 30:26.214
<i>to make her what she'd been before...</i>

30:26.849 --> 30:28.476
<i>to make him happy.</i>

30:33.957 --> 30:36.391
All that you say comes to the same thing.

30:36.459 --> 30:39.553
You are asking me to pass a sentence
of life or death on my wife.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.655
Insulin shock treatment
is an extreme measure, Paul...

30:42.732 --> 30:45.701
as Miss Connell pointed out
when she suggested it to me, but...

30:45.768 --> 30:49.363
You admit that this is terribly dangerous.
So why do you advise it?

30:49.439 --> 30:53.102
I've worked with it. I've seen cures.
It's at least a hope.

30:53.176 --> 30:56.907
It's the very danger itself, Paul,
that makes the cure possible.

30:57.213 --> 30:59.704
Insulin produces a state of coma.

30:59.782 --> 31:03.149
Then the patient is revived
by a violent shock to the nerves.

31:03.219 --> 31:05.915
That shock can kill, but it can also cure.

31:09.759 --> 31:10.987
I don't know.

31:11.060 --> 31:15.554
It's a hard decision to make,
but yours is only a technical responsibility.

31:15.698 --> 31:18.394
Technical responsibility.
Real responsibility.

31:18.468 --> 31:20.265
The question is, will she live or die?

31:20.336 --> 31:23.396
You're wrong, Mr. Holland.
It isn't a question of life or death.

31:23.473 --> 31:25.100
Your wife isn't living.

31:25.174 --> 31:28.166
She's in a world
that's empty of joy or meaning.

31:28.244 --> 31:30.872
We have a chance
to give her life back to her.

31:58.341 --> 32:01.139
- Well?
- She's alive, that's all.

32:04.914 --> 32:07.007
Don't take it so much to heart, Betsy.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.812
I imagined it so differently.

32:10.219 --> 32:14.280
I've been waiting for hours,
trying to imagine Jessica well again.

32:14.957 --> 32:16.754
And I come bringing you nothing.

32:16.826 --> 32:19.624
Instead, you come bringing me sympathy,
Betsy...

32:19.696 --> 32:22.597
and a generous heart. Don't forget that.

32:23.366 --> 32:25.357
Don't call that nothing.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.933
Very sad. Very sweet.

32:32.308 --> 32:35.573
The noble husband and the noble nurse
comforting each other...

32:35.645 --> 32:37.670
because the patient still lives.

32:39.015 --> 32:41.540
I've been imagining, too, Paul...

32:42.118 --> 32:44.643
only I didn't have to wonder how I'd feel.

32:45.221 --> 32:46.483
I knew.

32:48.858 --> 32:51.224
I'm not in love with another woman.

33:09.545 --> 33:12.207
I'm sorry, Miss Betsy.
I'll take it right away.

33:12.281 --> 33:15.011
That's all right, Alma.
Is this your sister's baby?

33:15.084 --> 33:18.281
Yes, Miss Betsy. This is little Ti-Victor
and my sister, Melisse.

33:18.354 --> 33:20.982
I'm so glad I came out.
I've been wanting to meet you, Melisse.

33:21.057 --> 33:22.285
More so, miss.

33:22.358 --> 33:25.521
He's a wonderful baby. He's beautiful, yes.

33:25.862 --> 33:27.124
He's chosen you, miss.

33:27.196 --> 33:30.290
That's what we say, Miss Betsy,
when a baby first goes visiting.

33:30.366 --> 33:32.698
Those he smiles at will be his friends.

33:32.769 --> 33:34.760
That makes me very proud.

33:35.338 --> 33:36.999
Here, Ti-Victor.

33:38.241 --> 33:40.300
That's so you won't forget I'm your friend.

33:40.376 --> 33:42.241
Thanks, Miss Betsy.

33:47.216 --> 33:49.411
It's nice to see people so happy.

33:49.619 --> 33:51.610
They're not always happy, Miss Betsy.

33:51.687 --> 33:52.984
I suppose not.

33:53.189 --> 33:56.750
Things so bad nobody can help,
not even Dr. Maxwell.

33:57.226 --> 33:59.888
Doctors and nurses
can do only so much, Alma.

34:00.296 --> 34:01.854
They can't cure everything.

34:01.931 --> 34:04.798
Doctors that are people
can't cure everything.

34:04.934 --> 34:06.834
What do you mean
"doctors that are people"?

34:06.903 --> 34:10.202
There are other doctors.
Yes, other doctors.

34:10.273 --> 34:11.570
Better doctors.

34:11.908 --> 34:13.773
- Where?
- At the <i>houmfort.</i>

34:14.076 --> 34:15.543
That's nonsense, Alma.

34:15.610 --> 34:18.136
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.

34:18.281 --> 34:19.714
Mama Rose was mindless.

34:19.782 --> 34:23.581
I was at the <i>houmfort</i> when the <i>houngan</i>
brought her mind back.

34:23.652 --> 34:26.554
- Was Mama Rose like Mrs. Holland?
- No.

34:26.656 --> 34:29.318
She was mindless
but not like Miss Jessica.

34:29.391 --> 34:30.882
But the <i>houngan</i> cured her.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.760
Are you trying to tell me that
the voodoo priest could cure Mrs. Holland?

34:34.831 --> 34:37.231
Yes, Miss Betsy, I mean that.

34:37.632 --> 34:39.760
The <i>houngan</i> will speak
to the rada drums...

34:39.835 --> 34:42.600
and the drums will speak
to Legba and Damballah.

34:44.407 --> 34:46.034
Better doctors.

34:54.617 --> 34:57.780
Ti-Peter, how do you ever expect
to get to heaven with one foot...

34:57.854 --> 35:01.153
in the voodoo <i>houmfort</i>
and the other in the church?

35:01.624 --> 35:03.353
Get along with you.

35:04.260 --> 35:06.160
Some of this native nonsense.

35:06.229 --> 35:10.393
The <i>houngan</i> has his prescription,
and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.332
You never talked
about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.563
Haven't I? I suppose I take it for granted.

35:15.638 --> 35:18.664
- It's just part of everyday life here.
- You don't believe in it?

35:18.741 --> 35:21.972
A missionary's widow?
Isn't very likely, is it?

35:22.044 --> 35:25.536
I don't mean believe in it
like believing in a religion.

35:26.182 --> 35:28.616
I mean, do you believe it has power?

35:28.684 --> 35:31.380
Do you think it could cure a sick person?

35:31.454 --> 35:34.048
Frankly, my dear,
I didn't expect anything like that...

35:34.123 --> 35:36.216
from a nice levelheaded girl like you.

35:36.292 --> 35:37.953
What are you driving at?

35:38.527 --> 35:41.519
I heard the servants talking
about Mama Rose.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.963
They said she'd been mindless.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.964
Her son drowned. It affected her mind.

35:48.037 --> 35:52.167
The <i>houngan</i> cured her
by giving her a little practical psychology.

35:57.513 --> 36:00.038
What if I took Jessica to see him?

36:00.116 --> 36:02.016
You don't know what goes on
at the <i>houmfort.</i>

36:02.084 --> 36:04.075
It might be very dangerous
to take her there...

36:04.153 --> 36:05.882
dangerous for both of you.

36:06.022 --> 36:07.785
These people are primitive.

36:07.857 --> 36:11.588
Things that are natural to them
might shock and horrify you.

36:13.062 --> 36:16.361
- I'm not easily frightened.
- That may be the pity of it.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.762
I'm going to the <i>houmfort,</i> Alma.

37:03.045 --> 37:06.572
You go right from the mill
to an obeah sign in the cane.

37:07.483 --> 37:11.112
Here you turn
and face a banyan tree on the hill.

37:11.988 --> 37:15.822
Walk toward it and keep walking.
Keep walking, Miss Betsy...

37:15.891 --> 37:18.155
and you'll come to the crossroads.

37:18.227 --> 37:22.220
There's a guard there, Carrefour.
He keeps the crossroads.

37:22.865 --> 37:26.699
But he won't do you no harm
when he sees the voodoo patches.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.966
He'll let you pass.

42:57.433 --> 42:58.991
Where are my people?

42:59.068 --> 43:03.095
Let them bring me the rice cakes.
Let them dance and be happy.

43:49.618 --> 43:52.519
Damballah, this woman is ill.

44:04.433 --> 44:05.627
Mrs. Rand.

44:06.468 --> 44:08.231
I knew you'd come.

44:08.303 --> 44:10.669
I couldn't let you go back
without some word.

44:10.739 --> 44:14.334
I came here to tell you again
Jessica cannot be cured.

44:15.244 --> 44:16.768
But what are you doing here?

44:36.198 --> 44:38.894
...and when my husband died,
I was helpless.

44:38.967 --> 44:40.366
They disobeyed me.

44:41.236 --> 44:45.002
And, accidentally, I discovered the secret
of how to deal with them.

44:45.607 --> 44:47.666
There was a woman with a baby.

44:47.743 --> 44:52.112
Again and again, I begged her
to boil the drinking water. She wouldn't.

44:52.648 --> 44:55.048
Then I told her the god Shango...

44:55.117 --> 44:58.348
would kill the evil spirits in the water
if she boiled it.

44:58.854 --> 45:01.345
From then on, she boiled the water.

45:01.423 --> 45:03.653
But that still doesn't explain
why you're here.

45:03.725 --> 45:06.159
Perhaps not, but I am here.

45:07.029 --> 45:10.157
It seems so simple
to let the gods speak through me.

45:11.300 --> 45:14.701
I should have known
there's no easy way to do good, Betsy.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.473
- She doesn't bleed.
- Zombie.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.975
She doesn't bleed.

45:59.248 --> 46:01.148
Get her back to the Fort, Betsy.

46:01.216 --> 46:03.411
Do as I say. They won't hurt you.

46:09.024 --> 46:11.788
Leave them alone. Let them go.

46:33.849 --> 46:35.976
Where have you been, Miss Connell?

46:39.388 --> 46:42.915
- I wanted to help you.
- Help me? How?

46:45.761 --> 46:48.321
I took Mrs. Holland to the <i>houmfort.</i>

46:48.797 --> 46:51.061
I thought they might cure her.

46:52.367 --> 46:55.359
There's no telling what
you may have started with this insanity.

46:55.437 --> 46:58.429
Because you wanted to give my wife
back to me?

46:58.507 --> 47:01.169
Why should that mean so much to you?

47:01.643 --> 47:02.871
You know why.

47:03.879 --> 47:06.575
You saw it the other night at the piano.

47:08.350 --> 47:11.911
What I saw the other night
I could hardly believe, Betsy.

47:13.221 --> 47:17.021
I thought I was looking at a woman
who had compassion for me...

47:17.526 --> 47:19.016
who loved me.

47:20.095 --> 47:22.427
And yet you made that trip
to the <i>houmfort...</i>

47:22.497 --> 47:24.328
to bring Jessica back to me.

47:25.634 --> 47:28.603
You, the nurse who's afraid of the dark.

47:32.441 --> 47:33.499
Yes.

47:34.943 --> 47:37.741
You think I love Jessica
and want her back.

47:38.380 --> 47:41.872
It's like you to think that,
clean, decent thinking.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.020
I wish it were true...

47:48.490 --> 47:50.424
perhaps for your sake.

47:57.032 --> 47:58.522
Mind me now, horse.

47:58.934 --> 48:00.697
Come away from there.

48:03.739 --> 48:05.172
Are you ever stubborn.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.731
Just like that old Sabreur man
at the <i>houmfort...</i>

48:07.809 --> 48:10.539
sticking your nose in places
where it isn't wanted...

48:10.612 --> 48:12.637
making trouble for everybody.

48:14.716 --> 48:15.705
Alma.

48:16.752 --> 48:18.515
You try it this way.

48:19.988 --> 48:21.853
Turn your back on him.

48:22.658 --> 48:24.649
You see, that's the way it is with a horse.

48:24.726 --> 48:27.320
You can't look at him
and lead him at the same time.

48:27.396 --> 48:29.557
Sounds sort of manlike, doesn't it?

48:30.265 --> 48:32.358
- Whose horse?
- The police horse.

48:32.434 --> 48:34.959
Police? I didn't know
there was a policeman on the island.

48:35.037 --> 48:36.470
Just this horse, Miss Betsy.

48:36.538 --> 48:39.530
When they asked the Commissioner
if any policemen were wanted...

48:39.608 --> 48:43.237
he said my horse is all the police
we need on Saint Sebastian.

48:43.311 --> 48:44.403
Commissioner?

48:44.479 --> 48:47.312
Yes, Miss Betsy.
I expect there's some trouble...

48:47.616 --> 48:50.278
not just little trouble,
like Mr. Rand gets into...

48:50.352 --> 48:53.879
when he's been drinking more than a little,
but real big trouble.

48:53.989 --> 48:57.288
You don't suppose it's because I took
Mrs. Holland to the <i>houmfort,</i> do you?

48:57.359 --> 49:00.385
They haven't been talking loud enough
for me to hear, Miss Betsy.

49:00.462 --> 49:03.625
But I've been holding this horse
for coming on close to an hour.

49:03.699 --> 49:05.963
And they've been just talking and talking.

49:06.034 --> 49:08.002
I feel it's something very bad.

49:10.205 --> 49:11.763
You do have a horse to hold, Alma...

49:11.840 --> 49:15.173
and Mrs. Rand has asked me
to have a cup of tea with her.

49:15.377 --> 49:17.242
Horse, you stand still.

49:51.179 --> 49:53.511
You're staying here with Jessica tonight,
Betsy?

49:53.582 --> 49:56.380
- Mrs. Rand thought it might be best.
- She's right.

49:58.754 --> 50:00.779
I've caused you so much trouble, Paul.

50:00.856 --> 50:02.881
No, it was bound to come.

50:03.291 --> 50:06.385
As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here.
I want to talk to you.

50:06.461 --> 50:09.362
Perhaps when you're finished in here,
you'd come into the garden.

50:09.431 --> 50:11.899
Is it about this afternoon?
I saw the Commissioner here.

50:11.967 --> 50:15.061
Jeffries? Yes, he was here.
He and Maxwell.

50:15.170 --> 50:16.831
They're in a great stew about it.

50:16.905 --> 50:18.429
Seems those people up at the <i>houmfort...</i>

50:18.507 --> 50:21.340
won't stop drumming and dancing
till they've gotten Jessica back...

50:21.409 --> 50:24.071
and finished their ritual tests,
something of that sort.

50:25.213 --> 50:29.809
For her own safety, Jeffries and Maxwell
want Jessica sent away to Saint Thomas...

50:29.885 --> 50:31.147
to the asylum.

50:32.053 --> 50:34.317
- It might be best.
- Maybe.

50:34.856 --> 50:36.949
But Wesley insists she stay here.

50:37.225 --> 50:38.715
But he hasn't the right.

50:38.794 --> 50:41.661
He hasn't any legal right,
if that's what you mean.

50:41.930 --> 50:44.899
But he says that I am responsible
for Jessica's illness...

50:44.966 --> 50:47.230
that I deliberately drove her insane.

50:48.203 --> 50:50.364
You couldn't have done that, Paul.

50:50.639 --> 50:51.867
I don't know.

50:52.274 --> 50:54.970
I've gone over it and over it,
and I don't know.

51:43.859 --> 51:47.192
I want you out of it.
I want you to go back to Canada, Betsy.

51:47.262 --> 51:48.320
Why?

51:48.396 --> 51:50.694
Because of Jessica. Because of myself.

51:51.032 --> 51:53.796
Because I don't want you
to be made miserable and unhappy.

51:53.869 --> 51:55.336
But I want to stay.

51:55.670 --> 51:59.333
I'm afraid it's not what you want.
I want you back in Canada.

51:59.708 --> 52:02.506
Naturally, as my employer,
you have the right to dismiss me.

52:02.577 --> 52:05.546
Don't, Betsy.
You know that isn't what I mean.

52:06.848 --> 52:09.146
You remember the first night I saw you?

52:09.217 --> 52:12.209
You were looking at the sea.
You were enchanted.

52:12.721 --> 52:15.281
But I felt I had to destroy
that enchantment...

52:15.357 --> 52:17.382
make you see ugliness and cruelty.

52:17.459 --> 52:19.484
- You were trying to warn me.
- No.

52:19.794 --> 52:21.523
I was trying to hurt you.

52:21.630 --> 52:24.963
It was the same way with Jessica.
I had to hurt her.

52:25.033 --> 52:28.400
Everything she did or said
made me lash out at her.

52:28.637 --> 52:30.468
That's why I want you to go.

52:30.972 --> 52:32.337
You see, Betsy...

52:35.110 --> 52:36.509
since you've been here...

52:36.578 --> 52:40.378
I've seen how fine and sweet things
can be between a man and a woman...

52:40.448 --> 52:42.575
how love can be calm and good.

52:44.152 --> 52:48.111
I'd rather not have that sort of love,
than have it and destroy it.

52:48.189 --> 52:49.918
You want me to leave you?

52:50.158 --> 52:51.750
That's why I want you to go.

52:51.826 --> 52:55.489
It's no good for you to stay
so long as I have this fear of myself.

55:24.279 --> 55:25.769
Paul.

55:33.288 --> 55:34.983
What are you doing here?

55:38.560 --> 55:39.925
Get out of here.

55:47.569 --> 55:48.661
Carrefour!

55:50.672 --> 55:52.162
Carrefour, go back.

56:00.582 --> 56:04.211
Paul, let him go.
Don't touch him. Don't try to stop him.

56:24.139 --> 56:26.334
I can send this off by the next boat.

56:26.407 --> 56:28.739
If you have any letters,
you'd better get them ready...

56:28.810 --> 56:30.141
to go with this parcel.

56:30.211 --> 56:32.406
Any news I have can wait till I get home.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.744
It will be pretty stale by that time.

56:34.883 --> 56:36.714
Perhaps not, Mother.

56:37.552 --> 56:39.315
Betsy is leaving us.

56:39.921 --> 56:42.389
Why, Betsy, we can't lose you.

56:42.924 --> 56:46.724
We've grown to depend on you.
I have and I know Paul has.

56:46.794 --> 56:48.785
Mother, Betsy has her reasons.

56:50.698 --> 56:53.963
I hope you won't feel I'm deserting you
or think badly of me.

56:54.035 --> 56:55.866
Think badly of you, Betsy?

56:59.274 --> 57:02.038
Dr. Maxwell has
some unpleasant news for us.

57:02.110 --> 57:04.908
- An accident at the mill?
- No, it's about Jessica.

57:05.013 --> 57:07.948
A result of our discussion
the other day, I'm afraid.

57:08.016 --> 57:09.210
What about her?

57:09.284 --> 57:12.879
In view of all the circumstances,
some of the things Wesley's been saying...

57:12.954 --> 57:16.549
and the fact that one of the voodoo people
got into your house last night...

57:16.624 --> 57:19.149
the Commissioner has decided
on a legal investigation.

57:19.227 --> 57:20.694
In other words, I'm on trial.

57:20.762 --> 57:22.252
I wouldn't put it that way, Paul...

57:22.330 --> 57:25.561
but there's been a lot of talk.
The whole thing's getting out of hand.

57:25.633 --> 57:28.261
A pretty scene, half the island
crowding into the courtroom...

57:28.336 --> 57:30.270
to watch our dirty linen
get a public scrubbing.

57:30.338 --> 57:32.329
Wait a bit, Wes.
Let's talk this over with the...

57:32.407 --> 57:35.467
Talk it over! Talk now, Paul,
and tell them that you're not responsible...

57:36.211 --> 57:40.011
that every bit of this doesn't rest squarely
on your shoulders.

57:40.815 --> 57:43.841
If you'll be good enough
to take me to the Commissioner, Doctor.

57:43.918 --> 57:47.081
I think there'll be no need
of an investigation.

57:47.155 --> 57:50.352
But why, Mrs. Rand?
What could you have to tell him?

57:50.425 --> 57:52.393
Jessica is not insane.

57:52.961 --> 57:54.519
Please take me to the Commissioner.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.223
I can explain the whole thing to him.

57:56.297 --> 57:58.458
Mother, what are you trying to say?

57:59.167 --> 58:00.395
She is dead.

58:00.868 --> 58:02.301
Now, Mrs. Rand.

58:02.837 --> 58:04.099
She is dead...

58:04.672 --> 58:06.230
living and dead.

58:06.674 --> 58:10.610
Mrs. Rand, you're not seriously trying
to tell me that my patient is a zombie?

58:10.678 --> 58:12.009
I'm not mad.

58:12.814 --> 58:13.940
It's true.

58:15.016 --> 58:16.574
- I did it.
- Mother.

58:16.718 --> 58:18.345
Wesley, let me explain.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.980
I wanted to so often. Now I have to.

58:24.492 --> 58:28.519
Betsy, tell them about the <i>houmfort,</i>
tell them what you saw there.

58:29.964 --> 58:32.865
You must, Betsy,
they'll have to believe you.

58:33.468 --> 58:35.333
Mrs. Rand was at the <i>houmfort...</i>

58:35.403 --> 58:36.995
but there's nothing wrong with that.

58:37.071 --> 58:38.299
She's gone there for years...

58:38.373 --> 58:40.500
trying to take care of those people,
to help them.

58:40.575 --> 58:42.236
I think I understand.

58:42.310 --> 58:46.303
I've often talked a little voodoo
to get medicine down a patient's throat.

58:47.015 --> 58:51.145
But it was more than that, Doctor.
I entered into their ceremonies.

58:51.719 --> 58:54.483
I pretended I was possessed by their gods.

58:55.857 --> 58:58.087
But what I did to Jessica...

58:59.193 --> 59:02.128
It was when she wanted to go away
with Wesley.

59:02.196 --> 59:04.630
That night, I went to the <i>houmfort.</i>

59:04.699 --> 59:07.896
I kept seeing her face smiling
because she was beautiful enough...

59:07.969 --> 59:11.166
to take my family in her hands
and tear it apart.

59:12.307 --> 59:14.832
The drums, the chanting, the lights.

59:15.543 --> 59:18.410
I heard a voice speaking
in the sudden silence...

59:19.947 --> 59:21.278
my voice.

59:22.050 --> 59:24.382
I was speaking to the <i>houngan.</i>

59:25.086 --> 59:26.644
I was possessed.

59:28.156 --> 59:30.624
I told him the woman
at Fort Holland was evil...

59:30.692 --> 59:32.853
and asked him to make her a zombie.

59:33.094 --> 59:34.789
Then what happened?

59:35.029 --> 59:36.587
I hated myself.

59:36.798 --> 59:39.494
On the way home,
I said over and over again...

59:39.567 --> 59:41.626
there were no such people...

59:42.370 --> 59:44.463
no strange drugs...

59:46.274 --> 59:49.243
- there was no such thing as a zombie.
- You were right.

59:49.610 --> 59:51.976
I said it, and I made myself believe it.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.314
But when I got here,
Jessica was raging with fever.

59:55.383 --> 59:57.442
She was raging with fever.

59:57.552 --> 01:00:02.046
A fever with a long Latin name
and a bad reputation for its aftereffects...

01:00:02.957 --> 01:00:04.686
usually some form of insanity.

01:00:04.759 --> 01:00:06.249
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.

01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:08.454
You were tricked
by your own imagination, Mrs. Rand.

01:00:08.663 --> 01:00:11.393
But I am not an imaginative
or fanciful woman, Doctor.

01:00:11.466 --> 01:00:13.127
As I understand it...

01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:15.795
in order to turn a person into a zombie...

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:18.430
whether by poison or hocus-pocus...

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.335
you must first kill that person.

01:00:21.442 --> 01:00:22.704
Is that right?

01:00:23.177 --> 01:00:24.166
Yes.

01:00:24.278 --> 01:00:26.906
She was feverish. She was delirious.

01:00:27.815 --> 01:00:30.215
But I don't remember her dying...

01:00:30.518 --> 01:00:33.351
or even being in a state resembling death.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:35.249
No coma, nothing.

01:00:38.326 --> 01:00:41.659
I'm afraid you are an imaginative woman,
Mrs. Rand.

01:00:42.997 --> 01:00:44.362
Of course.

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:47.990
Of course.

01:01:19.834 --> 01:01:21.028
Jessica.

01:01:23.571 --> 01:01:24.560
Jessica.

01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:28.030
Jessica.

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:30.275
She won't obey me.

01:01:30.511 --> 01:01:31.500
Jessica!

01:01:43.925 --> 01:01:45.688
It's the <i>houmfort...</i>

01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:47.928
they're trying to get her back.

01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:50.793
But how can they?
How could they make her understand?

01:01:50.865 --> 01:01:52.093
How would she know?

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.428
They know how.

01:01:53.568 --> 01:01:56.969
They have charms that can draw a man
halfway around the world.

01:01:57.071 --> 01:01:59.130
Obeah tricks, magic...

01:01:59.607 --> 01:02:01.131
everybody knows that.

01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:03.905
We may have believed all that
when we were boys, Wes.

01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:06.742
But we're grown men now.
We know it's all nonsense.

01:02:06.814 --> 01:02:08.042
- Do we?
- Yes.

01:02:08.149 --> 01:02:10.140
- You've forgotten...
- I have not forgotten.

01:02:10.218 --> 01:02:13.153
I could see what was in your mind
when Maxwell was talking.

01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:15.587
Just because he didn't know
about Jessica's coma...

01:02:15.656 --> 01:02:17.624
you thought everything
he said was wrong...

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.489
and that mother's story was right.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.755
- That's ridiculous.
- It is true.

01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:23.858
Why did she come out here?

01:02:23.998 --> 01:02:26.660
How can they make her move,
do anything they want?

01:02:26.734 --> 01:02:28.531
They can make anybody
do what they want.

01:02:28.603 --> 01:02:30.833
You're thinking
just as they want you to think.

01:02:30.905 --> 01:02:32.429
That's what it's for...

01:02:32.673 --> 01:02:34.766
the conches, their cheap mummery.

01:02:34.909 --> 01:02:36.001
Let me in.

01:02:36.744 --> 01:02:38.336
Come with me, Jessica.

01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:41.571
You saw that.

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.910
I saw nothing
that would convince a sober man.

01:02:45.987 --> 01:02:48.353
You better get some sleep, Wes.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.806
Why don't you go to bed, Wes?
It's been a hard day for all of us.

01:03:15.716 --> 01:03:17.411
I'm sorry, Wes.

01:03:17.652 --> 01:03:19.847
I think I know how you must feel...

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.616
and I am sorry.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:24.988
I only wish
there was something I could do.

01:03:25.059 --> 01:03:26.890
She ought to be free.

01:03:30.698 --> 01:03:32.757
You could free her, Betsy.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.395
You could do it.
You're a nurse. You have the drugs.

01:03:35.469 --> 01:03:36.959
It would be so quick.

01:03:38.806 --> 01:03:41.832
Her heart beats. She breathes.
That's life, Wes.

01:03:44.078 --> 01:03:46.569
I once took an oath to guard life.

01:03:47.548 --> 01:03:48.947
I shouldn't have asked it of you.

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:51.075
But it was only because
I can't make you believe...

01:03:51.152 --> 01:03:52.676
that she's already dead.

01:03:53.554 --> 01:03:55.215
Wait a minute.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.624
There's one other thing.

01:03:57.992 --> 01:03:59.289
You love Paul.

01:04:00.928 --> 01:04:03.294
Then what good will it ever do you
if Jessica is still...

01:04:03.364 --> 01:04:04.353
Wesley.

01:04:06.834 --> 01:04:09.132
I'm afraid I love him too much for that.

01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:11.865
I'm sorry.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.816
<i>Oh, Lord God, most holy...</i>

01:07:45.953 --> 01:07:49.389
<i>deliver them</i>
<i>from the bitter pains of eternal death.</i>

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.758
<i>The woman was a wicked woman...</i>

01:07:51.826 --> 01:07:54.386
<i>and she was dead in her own life.</i>

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:55.790
<i>Yea, Lord...</i>

01:07:55.896 --> 01:07:58.922
<i>dead in the selfishness of her spirit...</i>

01:07:59.066 --> 01:08:01.227
<i>and the man followed her.</i>

01:08:01.302 --> 01:08:04.032
<i>Her steps led him down to evil.</i>

01:08:04.271 --> 01:08:06.569
<i>Her feet took hold on death.</i>

01:08:07.007 --> 01:08:08.668
<i>Forgive him, oh, Lord...</i>

01:08:08.843 --> 01:08:11.869
<i>who knowest the secret of all hearts.</i>

01:08:12.346 --> 01:08:13.813
<i>Yea, Lord...</i>

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:16.149
<i>pity them who are dead...</i>

01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:19.510
<i>and give peace and happiness</i>
<i>to the living.</i>
