I'm intentionally being much worse
in bed than I actually am

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.688
so that it can just
keep getting better forever.

01:29:57.851 --> 01:30:00.570
But, like, very slowly,
over many, many decades

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:02.481
so that we hit our sexual peak
in our 90s.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:04.524
Yeah. That's the plan, actually,

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:10.789
is if the last time we have sex is also
the best and that it actually kills you.

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:12.745
That wouldn't be
such a bad way to go.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:17.962
- We should head back soon, right?
- Yes.

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:22.209
Or we could stay here
for another minute.

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:26.216
Or maybe like forever.

01:30:27.305 --> 01:30:33.220
