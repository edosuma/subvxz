00:02.570 --> 00:03.736
This is not you.

00:03.738 --> 00:05.004
Jennifer, this is me.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.972
I saw Tobias murder my father.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.475
The evidence against him is...
It's all gone.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.276
Tobias, how's it feel
to be exonerated?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.979
I want to once again become
an active member in society

00:13.981 --> 00:15.381
and a pillar
of this community.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.783
I take my work
really seriously.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.986
Doesn't mean I can't take
other things seriously, too.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.921
I'd like to try.

And no one
has her experience in

00:34.935 --> 00:36.435
We're gonna homeschool you.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.904

He is not who he was.

You don't think I know that?

[Gambi]<i> Thirty years ago,</i>

00:47.148 --> 00:50.149

00:50.151 --> 00:52.284
I leaked
the information to your father

00:52.286 --> 00:54.420
and his investigation
got him killed.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.479
-You're gonna love these.
-Come on, let's go.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.513

03:37.151 --> 03:39.251
You know,
I have to say, Anissa,

03:39.253 --> 03:42.854
that I was surprised to get
your call the other day.

03:42.856 --> 03:46.925
We haven't exactly had
volunteers breaking our doors
down after that, um...

03:46.927 --> 03:48.560
-Bomb scare.
-Yeah.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.563
Man, I could imagine.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.464
And I really believe
in the work
that you're doing here,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.934
and I figure, right now,
you could use the help.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.369
And you'd be right.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.505
After the incident,

04:00.506 --> 04:03.140
we had six
of our staff members
hand over their resignations.

04:03.143 --> 04:07.145
-But we refuse
to close our doors.
-Amen.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.147
For most of these patients,

04:09.149 --> 04:14.519
this clinic provides
the only medical care
they have access to.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.889
Now, it goes without saying,

04:17.891 --> 04:21.326
that this position is yours
if you want it.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.629
But I have to be
upfront with you,

04:24.265 --> 04:25.831
it isn't an easy job.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.816
[chuckles]

04:27.817 --> 04:29.800
You know, I don't...
I'm not really one to
back down from a challenge.

[chuckles]

04:30.971 --> 04:33.038
You sound just like Jefferson.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.774
I heard he stepped down
as the principal.
How's he doing?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.643
He's good, he's good.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.878
-Well, tell him
I'm praying for him.
-I will.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.314

such a dumbass question,
but it's okay.

You hate that name.

Yeah, I really do. But I will
kill for it right now,

06:29.490 --> 06:31.723

I was actually in school

06:31.725 --> 06:33.358
and not locked
in the Pierce Penitentiary

06:33.360 --> 06:36.495

What if I'm not built
to be a mother?
What if I just screw up?

who has amazing parents,

whether you're good enough
to raise children,

looks like?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.965
Depends on what law
you're referring to.

Let me ask you a question.

10:19.853 --> 10:23.154
How would

The same Martin Proctor
that's poisoned,

10:31.198 --> 10:34.733
kidnapped and killed
Freeland's black kids.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.836
Yeah, that's what I thought.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.808
I inherited a briefcase
that has all kinds
of goodies in it,

10:43.810 --> 10:47.879
including a file on you,
with all your dirt.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.854
What am I supposed
to do with this?

10:55.856 --> 10:58.189
Put that Princeton degree
to work and rack 'em.

Something happened
tonight, Jeff.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.856
Gambi was attacked
near downtown Freeland.

shot up pretty bad.

-No, Jeff.

I'm sorry, man, but that's
not gonna be possible.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.909
I'm so sorry.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.121

Because this just doesn't
make any sense.

and I'm Black Lightning.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.834
When can we see the body?

12:15.836 --> 12:18.636

blown to hell and back, Jeff.

no one got out of the SUV

Really am.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.413
[door opens and closes]

13:03.617 --> 13:06.084
Why didn't you tell him
about Uncle Gambi?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.219
Because he already
knows enough.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.157
And with all that's going on
with the kids in the pods,

13:12.159 --> 13:14.626
that is a can of worms
we do not want to open.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.129
So, we protect Gambi,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.964
like he's always protected us.

13:22.836 --> 13:26.838
All right, then. Okay, so...
Now it's just you and me.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.473
I'mma go grab my keys.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.175
Wait, keys for what?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.977
For what? So we can
go to the sanctum
and get our suits.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.579
Okay, and then what?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.582
No, no, we sit tight.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.019
Oh, come on, Dad. Sit tight?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.220
Exactly.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.724
This... This is Gambi
we're talking about.

13:46.726 --> 13:50.528
All right? The man has
contingency plans
for his contingency plans.

13:51.898 --> 13:55.266
So I... I will not
believe that he is dead

13:55.268 --> 13:57.902
until I can see it
with my own eyes.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.204
Until then...

14:00.807 --> 14:04.442
I'm gonna assume
that he's alive and well.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.893
I'll be damned.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.963
She did it.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.500
I stayed up
working on it all night.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.104
Let's start trials.

14:33.673 --> 14:34.939
Not yet.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.408
Sorry?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.977
We're not starting trials,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.746
at least not yet.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.816
You have the cure for kids
that have been languishing
in pods for 30 years,

14:44.818 --> 14:46.851
and you're
choosing not to use it?

14:46.853 --> 14:48.987
You ran the sims.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.256
Over 10,000 simulations,
and in every one,

14:51.258 --> 14:53.892
every single one, over half
the vaccine kids die.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.661
-Yeah. And half lived.
-That's not good enough.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.529
The Green Light kids are
getting stronger every day,

14:58.531 --> 15:01.733
and we have 28 vaccine victims
who are fading.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.234
Their lives are in our hands.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.937
We're not
giving them that serum
until we can save them all.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.447
[knocking at door]

15:16.449 --> 15:17.682
[Anissa] Jen, you in there?

15:26.192 --> 15:28.860
All right, Harriet,
you caught me.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.362
I know I'm still blazing,
but it's the only thing

15:31.364 --> 15:33.831
that keeps me from turning
into a human flashlight.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.034
I didn't come in here
to lecture you.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.835
Really? You didn't?
That's a first.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.103
[laptop chimes]

15:39.105 --> 15:43.041
Um, maybe you should, uh...
You should sit down.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.378
Anissa, you're scaring me.
What's-- What's up?

15:49.516 --> 15:50.682
Uncle Gambi...

15:52.252 --> 15:53.418
He's gone.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.453
What do you mean, "gone"?

15:57.390 --> 15:58.957
Well, he, uh...

15:59.859 --> 16:02.026
He was attacked
by some gunmen and...

16:03.463 --> 16:04.996
he didn't make it.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.201
[whimpering]

16:11.972 --> 16:13.671
[Jen sniffling]

16:13.673 --> 16:15.807
I don't...
I don't know what to say.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.275
Come here. I'm sorry.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.145
-[sobbing]
-I'm sorry.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.717
-Oh, my God.
-I'm sorry.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.129
[knocking at door]

16:52.345 --> 16:53.478
Anissa?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.547
Is it all right
if I come in for a second?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.050
Sure, come in.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.789
I wasn't expecting company,
so excuse the mess.

17:06.526 --> 17:11.029
Look, I'm, I'm sure
I'm selfish for just
popping by like this, but...

17:14.968 --> 17:16.734
My uncle, he died tonight.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.371
Yeah, it was unexpected.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.374
But it got me thinking...

17:24.911 --> 17:27.278
if I knew
I only had one day to live,

17:27.280 --> 17:30.415
who, besides my family,

17:30.417 --> 17:32.417
would I want
to spend that day with?

17:34.020 --> 17:36.254
I only came up with one name.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.624
You.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.563
What do you expect me to say
to something like that?

17:47.434 --> 17:49.700
I don't want you
to say anything.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.639
[Anissa sighs]

19:01.641 --> 19:02.907
What are you thinking?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.210
Thinking I was right.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.813
This was a mistake.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.317
[exhales]

19:21.294 --> 19:23.461
Anissa, you know
how I feel about you.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.832
And... I'm sorry
about your uncle.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.168
I really am.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.237
But I'm not your handbag.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.407
What... What does that mean?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.010
That means you can't
show up and have sex with me

19:39.012 --> 19:40.478
when you're
feeling vulnerable,

19:40.480 --> 19:43.714
and then disappear
when your world is
right-side up again.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.283
That's not what this is.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.255
My family...

19:54.694 --> 19:57.995
They weren't exactly
the most present people,

19:57.997 --> 20:01.632
and I learned a long time ago
to just depend on myself,

20:02.268 --> 20:03.901
not let anyone in.

20:07.140 --> 20:12.443
Then, you walked
into my bookstore and...

20:13.780 --> 20:15.213
everything changed.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.555
And if you can't
realize that

20:25.658 --> 20:27.258
you can do me real harm,

20:28.995 --> 20:30.861
I need you
to stay away from me.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.002
Can you look me in the eyes
and promise me you won't
hurt me again?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.873
[scoffs]

20:42.875 --> 20:44.442
That's what I thought.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.677
Come on, Grace,
don't just walk away.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.546
Grace.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.748
-Grace!

21:27.320 --> 21:28.853
Mom, what are we doing here?

21:28.855 --> 21:31.656
I thought Dad said
we weren't having
a service for Uncle Gambi.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.858
You father's
hurting right now, sweetie.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.660
And once he comes to terms
with the situation,

21:35.662 --> 21:38.596
he's gonna want
something done to honor Gambi.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.665
I'm just getting
the ball rolling, that's all.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.435
I still can't
believe he's dead.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.638
I mean, we were
just in the forest
fighting off ASA agents.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.707
I know, sweetie.

21:50.576 --> 21:51.909
You, and me, and Gambi had

21:51.911 --> 21:53.377
-a complicated relationship.
-[cell phone vibrating]

21:53.379 --> 21:54.945
I wish I could've
told him more

21:54.947 --> 21:58.616
how much I appreciated
how fiercely
he loved this family.

22:00.887 --> 22:01.986
Found it.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.755
What's that?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.692
It's an old-fashioned
pocket watch.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.177
you have to stop
worrying about me.

Now, I said
that I'm fine, and I am.

24:12.418 --> 24:13.717
So, I went by Gambi's place

24:13.719 --> 24:16.053
just to check in
on things, and...

24:17.023 --> 24:19.089
I found this.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.693
What... What are you doing?
Why do you have
Gambi's pocket watch?

24:22.695 --> 24:25.429
I thought he'd want you
to have it, considering--

24:25.431 --> 24:26.864
No, take it back!

24:28.434 --> 24:31.502
-What?
-Look, this is Gambi's.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.838
It's his.
It belongs at his house!

-You had no right to take it.
-Jefferson, you're
not serious--

24:36.108 --> 24:38.843

I will take it back myself.

to give you a ride home?

25:12.612 --> 25:15.045
No. I'm waiting for Henderson.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.947
You're bringing
a cop to my bar, man?

25:18.684 --> 25:21.552
No, I'm bringing--
I'm bringing my friend.

He's still a cop.

just holler. All right?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.970

26:15.675 --> 26:16.974
Now, you know
better than that, Jeff.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.609
Do you have any idea
what could've just happened?

26:18.611 --> 26:20.277
No, look now, Henderson...

26:21.781 --> 26:24.582
You have no idea
what my life is like.

The sacrifices I made.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.723

I've given everything
for this city, man.

and it just takes.

26:40.766 --> 26:44.668

and takes and takes.

Did you pay the man?

Yes, sir.

Caviar? No.

they try caviar,

27:35.988 --> 27:39.056
and the first time
they can enjoy it
without worrying what it cost.

27:43.729 --> 27:46.497
Twenty years ago today,
I pulled Syonide up
out of that orphanage

27:46.499 --> 27:47.965
and made her my family.

27:49.568 --> 27:53.303
This meal was planned
months ago to celebrate
our familial anniversary.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.441
You had one job.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.244
Partner with Syonide
and you failed.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.880
-Mr. Tobias,
I already told you--
-I'm still talking.

28:04.717 --> 28:08.419
Since I lost Joey, Tori
and Syonide, you're
the only family I have left.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.288
Reminds me of a parable

28:11.290 --> 28:14.725
my evil bastard of a father
told me when I was a child.

28:14.727 --> 28:18.162
There was two brothers.
One weak, one strong.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.197
After spending a lot of time,
effort and energy

28:20.199 --> 28:21.899
trying to toughen
the weaker brother up,

28:21.901 --> 28:24.168
the stronger brother
had to finally decide

28:24.170 --> 28:28.238
if the weaker brother
had what it took
to survive on his own.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.008
And if he didn't,

28:31.911 --> 28:34.812
it was
the stronger brother's duty

28:34.814 --> 28:38.816
to put the weaker brother
out of his misery.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.819
Out of love, of course.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.256
Do you understand
what I'm telling you
right now?

28:53.833 --> 28:55.499

29:28.601 --> 29:30.467
You have to save the baby.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.236
<i> -Code blue, lobby.</i>
-Find Anaya.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.971
<i> Code blue, lobby.</i>

29:34.740 --> 29:36.673
Save...

29:36.675 --> 29:38.008
-Oh, no. Deacon.
<i> -Code blue, lobby.</i>

29:38.010 --> 29:39.743
-Deacon, come on. No.
<i> -Code blue, lobby.</i>

29:39.745 --> 29:41.211
Deacon?

29:41.881 --> 29:44.014
<i> Code blue, lobby. I repeat.</i>

29:52.191 --> 29:55.893
I'm gonna say something
that I don't ordinarily say
to anyone.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.795
You were right.

29:57.797 --> 30:01.999
I ran a new simulation,
and I may have found
a way to save all of them.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.035
I'm listening.

30:05.037 --> 30:08.539
We were looking at the pods
as individual organisms,

30:08.541 --> 30:10.440
not a collective unit.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.710
If we just increase
the serum dosage 28-fold,

30:13.712 --> 30:16.980
accounting for the number
of vaccine kids,
and spin the cells--

30:16.982 --> 30:19.016
And stave off
cellular deterioration.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.350
They may reach a gestalt

30:20.352 --> 30:23.587
with overall cell stability
in the entire organism.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.423
Show me.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.828
[beeping]

30:38.804 --> 30:40.470
What the hell?

30:40.472 --> 30:42.940
Baby, let me call you back.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.008
I know I said
tonight was all about...

30:45.544 --> 30:47.878
Hello? Hello? Damn!

30:51.884 --> 30:53.884
You just can't be sneaking up
on people like that.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.886
Man, I could have shot you!

30:55.888 --> 30:59.723
If I had a gun, which I don't.
'Cause I'm on probation.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.258
You still got
your ear to the streets?

31:01.260 --> 31:04.161
Yeah, I know a little bit
about a little bit.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.295
What have you heard
about that attack

31:05.297 --> 31:07.397
in downtown Freeland
last night?

31:07.399 --> 31:11.168
Bruh, that wasn't no attack,
that was a hit.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.236
By who?

31:12.972 --> 31:14.605
Definitely wasn't
no local boys.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.707
I hear
probably the government.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.609
Why would the government
wanna kill a tailor?

31:18.611 --> 31:20.377
That's the
big question, right?

31:20.379 --> 31:24.014
I mean, he was the only
white dude in Freeland
besides the police.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.849
He basically raised
Jefferson Pierce.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.284
[sighs]

31:27.853 --> 31:29.419
All right, man. Look,

31:29.421 --> 31:32.055
who the hell knows
what's going on
around here anymore, anyway?

31:32.057 --> 31:34.591
Did you hear
about that boy jumping
out that body bag?

31:34.593 --> 31:35.859
That's crazy, right?

31:35.861 --> 31:39.863
Anybody see the old man
get out of the SUV?

31:39.865 --> 31:42.099
Yeah, everybody saw
what went down.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.967
That old man didn't
stand a chance.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.904
It's a messed up way
to go out,

31:46.906 --> 31:48.171
burning up in a car like that.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.008
Thanks.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.285
Yep.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.028
[Henderson] You all right?

32:11.030 --> 32:13.030
[Anissa] Not really. Um...

32:13.032 --> 32:14.698
You should've seen
his face, Henderson.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.701
He looked... He was terrified.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.303
You said you know this guy?

32:19.772 --> 32:21.038
Kinda.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.540
Well, he
and his girlfriend, Anaya,

32:23.542 --> 32:25.175
they came in here yesterday.

32:25.177 --> 32:29.179
Anything you can tell me
about him or this Anaya?

32:29.181 --> 32:31.915
I told you everything I know.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.351
And you say that
Deacon told you to find Anaya

32:34.353 --> 32:36.119
and save his baby?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.522
What does that mean to you?

32:38.524 --> 32:41.658
Maybe they were
in some kind of accident?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.394
Oh, my God. Henderson,
What if they're on the side
of the road somewhere?

32:44.396 --> 32:46.346
We have to go find them.

32:46.347 --> 32:48.297
You and I both know
this don't look
like no accident.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.069
Anissa?

32:54.106 --> 32:55.472
[Anissa] Oh, my God.

33:17.696 --> 33:18.762
That's some freaky--

33:26.638 --> 33:27.771
[computer beeping]

33:40.986 --> 33:43.520
[Anissa] Okay, he came
from South Freeland.

33:44.957 --> 33:46.123
[exhales]

33:46.125 --> 33:47.657
Thank you, Uncle Gambi.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.294
All right.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.798
[music playing softly
over speakers]

34:10.883 --> 34:12.349
Khalil, you cannot
be here right now.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.485
I know. But I heard
about your Uncle Gambi.

34:15.487 --> 34:18.221
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

34:20.826 --> 34:25.996
Look, I really appreciate
you checking on me,
but you gotta go.

34:25.998 --> 34:31.635
Okay. But look,
if you need anything, just...
Just call me, all right?

34:32.504 --> 34:33.570
Okay.

34:37.709 --> 34:38.842
What?

34:40.612 --> 34:41.711
Nothing.

35:33.699 --> 35:34.865
[sighs]

35:46.111 --> 35:47.410
[beeping]

35:53.886 --> 35:55.385
[sighs]

36:23.849 --> 36:25.382
[sobs]

36:49.675 --> 36:50.974
[Anissa clears throat]

36:55.314 --> 36:57.647
Anissa, how long
you been standing there?

36:59.117 --> 37:00.517
Long enough.

37:05.157 --> 37:06.590
Give me a hug, Dad.

37:17.469 --> 37:18.902
You know, [chuckles softly]

37:20.138 --> 37:23.940
Gambi told me once,
helping raise you,

37:25.177 --> 37:27.310
helping you become
Black Lightning,

37:29.014 --> 37:30.714
was the best thing
he ever did.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.250
[sniffles]

37:38.023 --> 37:39.556
What are you doing here?

37:40.425 --> 37:41.891
Same reason you're here.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.761
Dad, this place...

37:47.332 --> 37:48.832
reminds me of Gambi.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.436
I just needed to be here.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.509
Go. Go home. Get some rest.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.044
-I gotta--
-I'll lock up.

38:17.029 --> 38:20.463
The serum's been
injected into the pods'
main feeder line.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.865
We're ready to release.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.369
[beeping]

38:29.741 --> 38:31.508
[whirring]

38:40.752 --> 38:42.752
Wait. No.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.521
[alarm blaring]

38:44.523 --> 38:45.989
No.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.958
What-- What's going on?
What-- What--
What's happening?

38:50.896 --> 38:55.598
No. No! No! No, no, no, no.

38:57.402 --> 39:00.837
What's happening? No, no.

39:01.173 --> 39:04.274
No. No, no.

39:04.276 --> 39:06.109
[alarm blaring]

39:06.111 --> 39:08.611
What's happening?
The simulations!

39:08.613 --> 39:10.213
Told you
what you needed to hear.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.449
Fourteen of the vaccine kids
will survive.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.983
Inaction would have
killed them all.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.720
You should be proud
of yourself. You're a hero!

39:19.191 --> 39:20.590
Security, take her
out of here!

39:20.592 --> 39:22.926
And take her to whatever hole
you dragged her from.

39:22.928 --> 39:26.863
Congratulations!
We saved 14 lives, bitch!

39:29.935 --> 39:31.000
[computer beeping]

39:31.737 --> 39:33.002
No, no.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.006
[panting]

39:58.930 --> 40:00.063
[police siren wailing]

40:03.235 --> 40:04.534
Just what I need.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.455
Long way from home, missy.

40:26.825 --> 40:30.794
"Sheriff Clark." Can I ask
why you pulled me over?

40:31.663 --> 40:32.862
Suspicion.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.266
Of what?

40:36.268 --> 40:38.768
Wherever you're going,
they're closed.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.472
But I didn't tell you
where I was going.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.207
It don't matter.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.577
[exhales in frustration]

40:47.579 --> 40:50.180
There's a woman
who lives out here
I need to check on.

40:50.182 --> 40:51.681
Her name's Anaya.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.783
Step out of the car.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.984
You know what?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.520
[strange clicking]

41:03.495 --> 41:04.994
Oh, hell no!

41:08.166 --> 41:09.766
[tires screeching]

41:24.049 --> 41:26.115
[closing theme music playing]
