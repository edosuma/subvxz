WEBVTT

00:16.240 --> 00:18.800
He's going to kill himself on that thing

00:16.240 --> 00:18.800
one of these days.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.080
Chuck a steak on, Phil.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.880
One of your specials.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.640
Black on the outside, still bleeding in the middle.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.920
-Funny. -Come on,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.920
man, it gotta be done.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.480
Marky

00:32.760 --> 00:34.840
-No, you didn't mention it. -Well,

00:34.880 --> 00:37.680
-as Mark's going away tomorrow...

00:37.720 --> 00:40.480
...after dinner I thought we could have

00:37.720 --> 00:40.480
a little bon-voyage beer.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.360
Oh, you mean get drunk and start

00:40.520 --> 00:43.360
talking gibberish on the boat.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.480
Hmm, are we invited?

00:45.520 --> 00:48.200
Strictly boys only, I'm afraid.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.360
Well, brothers only, actually, Phil,

00:48.240 --> 00:51.360
no offence.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.120
Can't think of anything worse than watching you two

00:53.160 --> 00:55.800
-drinking yourselves stupid. -Well, that's what happens

00:55.840 --> 00:57.920
when you have a brother who thinks he's still 18.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.880
Better than being old before my time.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.960
ABIGAIL: Children, please.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.720
Benjamin.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.520
-Coming up.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.760
-You've got to, you promised.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.200
-I will.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.680
-Hey, look.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.680
Look at the sunset.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.000
-Morning, sir. -Good morning, Dwayne.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.920
Where is the Inspector?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.600
Uh, he should be here any minute, sir.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.800
He sometimes has trouble getting through the market.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.960
Well, Sergeant Bordey is still in Paris.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.960
They've extended her course,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.040
so she won't be here for another

01:56.000 --> 01:58.040
day or two.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.640
Yeah, we'll manage, sir. It's pretty quiet.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.560
Good. Let the Inspector know and have him call if

02:01.680 --> 02:05.560
there are any problems.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.960
Yes, sir.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.560
Extended her course.  Right!

02:13.840 --> 02:16.200
-Well. -Honore Police Station.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.160
Yeah, go on.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.760
Okay, um, well, try not to touch anything

02:22.800 --> 02:25.240
and we'll be there as soon as we can, okay?

02:25.280 --> 02:26.400
Okay.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.200
Phil Owen, down at the marina.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.160
Says someone's broken into his dive shed.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.120
-That's the thing. Nothing.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.960
Yeah, I found it like this when I came to

02:36.160 --> 02:38.960
work this morning.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Hey, Ben! I didn't think I'd see you until noon.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.720
-Mark and Ben had

02:53.800 --> 02:56.720
a session last night.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.680
-I don't think I'd be fit to dive.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.560
PHIL: Well, it's hard to tell. I mean,

03:00.720 --> 03:04.560
stuff's been moved about.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.640
Look, I might find something gone later. But I need to fix

03:04.600 --> 03:08.640
the door and the lock.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.560
So, you need a crime number for the insurance, eh?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.400
Yeah.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.240
-Oh.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.680
It's been a dream to run a dive school

03:15.280 --> 03:17.680
my whole life.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.160
Just be nice if it paid your rent too, eh?

03:23.680 --> 03:26.840
-My head doesn't think so.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.240
Right, let's get you written up.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.880
DWAYNE:  I think Mark had a bit too

04:12.480 --> 04:15.880
much to drink last night.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.680
You seen Benjamin?

04:20.720 --> 04:23.640
I saw him dive off the boat but that was

04:20.720 --> 04:23.640
a couple of hours ago.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.480
Well, he's not back.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.880
-His gear's still gone.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.720
I'll call Abigail.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.440
Abigail, is Benjamin with you? Oh. Um, no, it's just, um...

04:41.120 --> 04:43.560
No, no, no, no. No, it's okay, don't worry.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.600
Don't worry too much. I'll call you when

04:43.600 --> 04:46.600
we find him. Okay.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.120
-No.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.400
He's not back from his dive.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.000
Phil!

05:10.520 --> 05:11.840
Over here!

06:31.120 --> 06:32.240
Hello

06:39.920 --> 06:41.000
Hmm.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.960
Sir?

06:45.960 --> 06:47.080
Sir?

06:47.760 --> 06:50.080
Sir, you're burning up.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.720
Two slices of corned beef, please, Doris.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.800
-No. No,

06:51.760 --> 06:54.800
I've just had one, thank you.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.080
Okay, uh...

07:11.400 --> 07:13.600
Fidel, where are you?

07:13.640 --> 07:15.000
I'm with the Inspector.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.960
He's got a fever. The doctor's with him now.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.960
I'm down on the beach.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.240
We just pulled a body out of the water.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.120
Only, I don't think it was an accident.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.720
<i>Okay, I'll be</i> <i>there as soon as I can.</i>

07:28.200 --> 07:29.920
Thanks for coming. I wasn't sure who to call.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.320
-Tropical fever.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.600
-He needs total rest. -And chicken soup.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.400
What's wrong?

07:36.440 --> 07:38.640
Well, it's just if the Inspector is ill

07:36.440 --> 07:38.640
and Camille is away...

07:38.680 --> 07:40.640
-You and Dwayne can manage. -But that's just it.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.440
Dwayne just called and they've recovered

07:40.680 --> 07:43.440
a body from the sea.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.400
-Oh. -Yeah, and the thing is

07:45.440 --> 07:47.160
he thinks it's a murder.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.880
Benjamin Lightfoot went diving from that boat over there

07:52.920 --> 07:54.360
around 9:30 this morning.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.000
When he didn't come back, the alarm was raised,

07:57.040 --> 08:00.160
a search was made in the bay, and his body was

07:57.040 --> 08:00.160
eventually found

08:00.200 --> 08:03.400
over there by his boss's wife Alex

08:00.200 --> 08:03.400
in around 10 feet of water.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.880
So, why don't you think it was an accident?

08:05.920 --> 08:08.320
Because even if you ignore an experienced

08:05.920 --> 08:08.320
diver like Benjamin

08:08.360 --> 08:10.240
drowning in 10 feet of water,

08:10.280 --> 08:13.240
when we pulled him out, the air tank was full

08:13.280 --> 08:15.160
but the air valve was turned off.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.320
So someone turned it off and held him under water.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.880
I can't see how it could be anything else.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.120
-Okay, come on. -But what about

08:19.920 --> 08:23.120
signs of trauma?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.920
Yes, but it's a strange one.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.200
He had this weird bruise on his chest.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.160
But in a sharp rectangle, you know?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.880
Nothing on the sea bed could have done that.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.440
All right. But how can we even gather any evidence?

08:35.480 --> 08:37.680
I mean, the crime scene is underwater somewhere.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.960
I doubt we'll even be able to establish

08:37.720 --> 08:40.960
an accurate time of death.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
Okay, let's think.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.880
What would the Chief do first?

08:45.440 --> 08:46.440
Oh.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.280
Well, um...

08:49.320 --> 08:52.400
He'd pace up and down a bit, talking to himself.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.760
Then he'd moan about the heat.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.040
Then he'd tell me to do door-to-door enquiries.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.440
Okay, then you do that

09:00.480 --> 09:02.280
and I'll finish off this.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.160
You've not touched your soup.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.800
I'll get you a fresh bowl.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.920
Sir.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.280
What are you... No, no, but you're

09:59.960 --> 10:03.280
not supposed to be...

10:04.680 --> 10:07.880
No, I'm not telling you how the case is. No.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.760
No. Sir, I'm hanging up on you now. I'm hanging up

10:07.920 --> 10:11.760
on you now, sir.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.640
Hey, Phil, is Mark on his boat?

10:16.680 --> 10:18.440
Think so.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.760
-Not brilliant.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
Do you need to ask him questions now?

10:22.840 --> 10:24.720
I'm sorry, but I have to establish

10:22.840 --> 10:24.720
where everyone was

10:24.760 --> 10:27.560
-when Benjamin was diving. -Oh, that's an easy one.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.640
I was here with you. You were writing

10:27.600 --> 10:29.640
up the break-in

10:29.680 --> 10:32.280
-Yeah.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.920
-ALEX: I was out in the water

10:35.920 --> 10:37.040
Yeah.

10:39.480 --> 10:43.400
Can either of you think why anyone

10:39.480 --> 10:43.400
would want to kill Benjamin?

10:43.440 --> 10:45.400
No, everybody loved Benjamin.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.680
He could be a bit headstrong at times,

10:45.440 --> 10:49.680
but it was part of his charm.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.880
And he and Mark were definitely

10:49.720 --> 10:51.880
on the boat last night?

10:51.920 --> 10:54.680
Yeah, yeah. It was quite a night,

10:51.920 --> 10:54.680
by the sounds of it.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.120
Even heard them arguing at one point,

10:54.720 --> 10:58.120
when I was locking up.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.600
-I couldn't make

10:58.160 --> 11:00.600
out what it was about,

11:00.640 --> 11:02.560
but I heard Benjamin going off on one.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.760
Yeah, but they were brothers. They'd been drinking.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.400
It won't have been anything serious.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.280
Okay. Thanks.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.960
-Not much.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.560
-Nothing.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.680
Hello?

11:32.040 --> 11:33.280
Yes, sir.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.600
On our way, sir.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.480
That was the Commissioner. He wants us back

11:37.640 --> 11:40.480
at the station.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.600
Dwayne, Fidel,

11:46.640 --> 11:50.240
this is Detective Sergeant Angela Young.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.360
-She is in

11:50.280 --> 11:53.360
Sainte-Marie on holiday.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.840
But when she found out about our problem,

11:55.880 --> 11:58.600
she kindly volunteered to step in.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.720
She will be your senior officer.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.960
Until Inspector Poole or Sergeant Bordey returns.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.680
Is that understood?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.920
Make her as welcome as you can.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.520
-Very pleased to meet you, Angela.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.520
-Sergeant Young.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.440
Camille?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.760
No, it's Catherine.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.680
Your mother keeps bringing me soup.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.960
-Then you should eat it. -I can't tell her.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.800
She does that thing.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.120
With the eyebrows? And then the French thing.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.520
He'll have to wear it back to front

12:42.200 --> 12:44.520
or it will all pop out. Richard, can you hear me?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.040
-It's Catherine. -I didn't order any cheese!

12:50.200 --> 12:53.240
FIDEL: It was really good of you.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.040
To give up your holiday like this.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.840
We appreciate it.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.480
Yes, well, once you've seen the rainforest,

12:58.880 --> 13:01.480
waterfall and parrots

13:01.520 --> 13:04.160
and sat on the beach, that's about it, isn't it?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.680
I was bored by day three.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.280
-There's lots of... -I want a statement

13:08.320 --> 13:10.760
from the brother first. Call me when you're done.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.720
I want to see the wife myself.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.000
Ma'am. Uh...

13:21.760 --> 13:23.600
Why don't you do that?

13:30.120 --> 13:32.280
WOMAN ON PHONE:<i> Sir?</i>

13:32.320 --> 13:35.320
<i>Are you still there</i>

13:35.360 --> 13:38.000
Yes. I'm... I've, uh...

13:39.040 --> 13:41.040
...got a credit card.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.720
<i>-Yes, we do.</i>

13:51.400 --> 13:54.160
Hello? You must have the wrong number.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.320
I'm not supposed to be talking to you!

13:58.680 --> 14:00.160
You need rest!

14:31.640 --> 14:34.400
I can't imagine what it's like to lose a brother.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.240
-I'm truly sorry. -Thank you.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.920
We're just clearing a few things up.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.920
You okay?

14:38.960 --> 14:41.800
Yeah, yeah. Well, you have a job to do.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.920
DWAYNE: Benjamin stayed on your boat

14:43.440 --> 14:45.920
last night, didn't he?

14:45.960 --> 14:48.480
MARK: Yeah. Well...

14:48.520 --> 14:50.600
It's not my boat. It's what I do for a living.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.440
I crew boats.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.520
This one belongs to a Brit and about once a year

14:54.560 --> 14:56.520
I get to sail it back to the UK.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.800
I was supposed to be leaving today.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.720
That's why Benjamin was with me

14:59.840 --> 15:01.720
last night.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.280
It was a farewell drink.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.680
Our last night together for a while.

15:07.720 --> 15:12.000
Mark, did you and Benjamin have an argument last night?

15:12.040 --> 15:15.000
Only, someone thought they heard

15:12.040 --> 15:15.000
raised voices.

15:16.920 --> 15:21.360
We were drinking. We were loud.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.880
But if somebody was arguing, it wasn't me and Benjamin.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.680
If you and Benjamin had been drunk,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.600
gone to sleep very late,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.560
isn't it strange he still went diving?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.680
I guess. I would have stopped him, but he didn't even

15:33.600 --> 15:36.680
tell me he was going. I heard the splash

15:38.360 --> 15:41.440
as he went overboard. That's the first I knew.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.440
I thought divers had to tell someone

15:41.480 --> 15:44.440
when they go out.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.040
They do. But Benjamin wasn't

15:44.480 --> 15:47.040
very good at rules.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.000
After he'd gone, what did you do?

15:52.040 --> 15:55.360
Last-minute chores, getting the boat

15:52.040 --> 15:55.360
ship-shape before I set off,

15:55.400 --> 15:58.640
but when Benjamin didn't come back,

15:55.400 --> 15:58.640
I started to get worried.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.640
So I went to see Phil.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.080
You know the rest.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.280
So you've been on the boat since Benjamin was found?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.520
I went to the house to see Abigail, his wife,

16:06.320 --> 16:09.520
but she wasn't there.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.480
So after that, yeah, I've been here.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.440
So, if she wasn't there,

16:16.480 --> 16:18.800
who told her about her husband's death?

16:35.120 --> 16:38.200
-Distraught.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.240
Did he tell us anything we didn't already know?

16:40.280 --> 16:42.320
-Uh, not really. -This is

16:40.280 --> 16:42.320
the wife's house, yes?

16:42.360 --> 16:44.040
-Yes, ma'am. -Right, you come with me.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.160
Freddie, you can go write up the brother's

16:44.080 --> 16:46.160
statement for me to read

16:46.200 --> 16:47.520
-when I get back. -Ma'am, it's...

16:47.560 --> 16:48.840
Come on!

16:51.320 --> 16:53.200
We're so sorry about your husband.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.560
But we need to ask you some questions.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.600
It's okay. I need to know what happened, so please.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.480
Can I ask

17:06.520 --> 17:08.720
where were you when your

17:06.520 --> 17:08.720
husband's body was found?

17:09.440 --> 17:10.800
I was here.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.520
Oh, um...

17:13.560 --> 17:16.080
only, it's just your brother-in-law Mark

17:16.120 --> 17:19.040
told us he'd come up here to tell you the news

17:16.120 --> 17:19.040
straight afterwards

17:19.080 --> 17:20.600
and couldn't find you.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.200
Well, Phil, Benjamin's boss,

17:25.240 --> 17:29.280
rang earlier, said Benjamin

17:25.240 --> 17:29.280
was missing, so...

17:29.960 --> 17:31.240
I left soon after,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.040
went down to the bay.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.080
And that's when I found...

17:40.120 --> 17:42.920
Can you tell us a little about your husband?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.200
What kind of man was he?

17:49.640 --> 17:51.120
He was, um,

17:52.640 --> 17:54.360
perfect, you know?

17:55.520 --> 17:57.000
And I loved him.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.600
He was so looking forward to the birth and...

18:01.640 --> 18:03.600
Maybe we should leave this for a while.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.640
I do not appreciate being interrupted like that.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.680
But she's seven months pregnant

18:14.680 --> 18:16.680
and just lost her husband.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.280
And our job is to find his killer, not offer

18:16.720 --> 18:19.280
counselling to his relatives.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.000
That does not happen again. Do you understand?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.400
Yes, ma'am.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.520
Richard,

18:32.560 --> 18:34.600
-Hmm...

18:34.640 --> 18:37.240
-No.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.680
We didn't have any homework today.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.920
It had better not be.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.840
-Hmm.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.520
I'll be back later.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.520
-Goodnight, Mum.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.840
Young, red bandana.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.880
-No. -Okay, thank you, sir.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.280
-Nothing.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.720
A few boats came into the harbour yesterday,

18:57.320 --> 18:59.720
but no one saw a diver.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.160
-FIDEL:

18:59.760 --> 19:01.160
The brother's statement

19:01.200 --> 19:02.480
is on your desk, ma'am.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.120
There's a guy on one of the boats.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.600
DWAYNE: No.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.000
ANGELA: Then take Freddie and question him.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.720
But drop me back at the station first.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.560
You didn't hear Benjamin and Mark arguing.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.400
How would you know?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.280
Well, why didn't you tell me?

19:24.320 --> 19:27.920
Oh, right, so we're telling each other

19:24.320 --> 19:27.920
everything now, are we?

19:31.520 --> 19:33.160
Just like the old days?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.240
I've got no idea what you're talking about.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.360
I saw you.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.400
And him.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.880
The looks, the little whispers.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.800
Sneaking off in corners together.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.640
-Don't treat me like an idiot.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.480
That's what you said to the police,

19:48.680 --> 19:50.480
isn't it?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.400
"Everyone loved him."

19:52.440 --> 19:54.520
But it wasn't everyone, was it, Alex?

19:55.080 --> 19:56.760
It was you.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.560
-Don't laugh at me.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.880
Phil!

20:01.640 --> 20:04.840
Phil, I love you.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.560
I've never been interested in anybody else since

20:04.880 --> 20:08.560
the day that I met you.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.600
Especially not Benjamin. But I saw you.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.200
Yeah, you saw us whispering, maybe even huddled

20:13.160 --> 20:17.200
together in corners,

20:17.240 --> 20:20.240
but not because we were having an affair.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.680
What, then?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.880
DWAYNE: So...

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
How long have you been in Sainte

20:29.960 --> 20:33.040
-I arrived yesterday morning. -Mmm-hmm.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.600
And how long do you intend on staying?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.360
A few days.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.080
You was watching us through binoculars.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.080
Can I ask why?

20:41.120 --> 20:44.240
Yeah, I heard about that guy, the one that drowned.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.320
Well, I'm on me own on the boat all day.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.200
You guys are the most exciting thing that's happened

20:49.360 --> 20:52.200
since I got here.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.640
Are you going to tell me there's a law

20:52.240 --> 20:54.640
against being nosy?

20:56.240 --> 20:59.040
Okay, sir, thank you for your time.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.200
Pleasure. Thanks.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.320
-FIDEL: Oh, um...

21:45.520 --> 21:47.600
Danny Barber, native of Panama.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.400
Here sightseeing for a few days.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.560
There was something about him.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.680
I don't know what, but I didn't like him.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.960
-Then run a check. -I've got his

21:52.720 --> 21:55.960
photo on the camera.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.280
Shall I run it through the Interpol site

21:56.000 --> 21:58.280
as well?

21:58.320 --> 22:01.160
That's generally what I mean by a check.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.120
All right, so I've read all these reports.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.240
What software do you use to assimilate and

22:03.160 --> 22:06.240
cross

22:06.280 --> 22:08.560
-Where do you look

22:06.280 --> 22:08.560
at all the evidence

22:08.600 --> 22:10.960
in one place to cross

22:11.280 --> 22:12.600
Oh.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.880
-Yes, ma'am.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.320
Great.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.320
So, we have an experienced diver found dead in

22:28.360 --> 22:31.320
10 feet of water,

22:31.360 --> 22:34.000
his air tank turned off, strange marks on his chest.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.640
-Not yet, ma'am.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.160
The victim was drinking with his brother

22:36.680 --> 22:39.160
the night before

22:39.200 --> 22:40.800
and didn't tell anyone he was going out.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.080
We got these pictures from Mr Lightfoot's employers,

22:47.120 --> 22:48.880
Phil and Alex Owen.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.680
-Well,

22:50.720 --> 22:53.480
in every one of the photos when he's alive,

22:53.520 --> 22:56.520
he's wearing a red bandana, yes?

22:56.560 --> 22:58.600
But not when we found the body.

22:58.640 --> 23:02.080
I used to see him a lot at the marina,

22:58.640 --> 23:02.080
and he always wore a bandana.

23:02.120 --> 23:05.680
I'm pretty sure he was wearing it when I saw him

23:02.120 --> 23:05.680
jump off the boat.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.400
No, I think it fell off in the water somewhere.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.960
Only, the Inspector says that these little things

23:12.000 --> 23:13.320
are usually important, so...

23:13.360 --> 23:15.400
The Inspector isn't here, is he, Freddie?

23:15.440 --> 23:18.200
I am. And I want little things that mean something.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.280
Like an autopsy report, a time of death,

23:20.320 --> 23:22.440
forensic evidence, witness statements

23:20.320 --> 23:22.440
and a motive.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.400
Call the lab, chase up the reports.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.400
Then both of go through all the statements again

23:24.440 --> 23:26.360
and find me a motive!

23:38.320 --> 23:41.040
The boat guy?

23:41.080 --> 23:44.080
I typed in his description, got a photo match.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.280
He goes by a number of names.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.880
Danny Parker, Michael Smith.

23:49.920 --> 23:54.200
But his real name is Danny Fernandez and he's on

23:49.920 --> 23:54.200
an Interpol watch list.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.720
-Gun-running,

23:54.240 --> 23:58.720
drugs, conflict diamonds.

23:58.760 --> 24:03.400
So the passport he showed us, it must be a fake.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.720
It would be quite something to make

24:03.440 --> 24:06.720
an arrest this quickly.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.120
Well, go and pick him up, then.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.360
-Get down!

24:25.360 --> 24:26.680
Stop! Police!

24:43.040 --> 24:45.560
Endangering the life of a police officer.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.600
And travelling under a false passport,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.600
but mostly for the first one.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.040
-I've done nothing wrong. -He tried to run, ma'am.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.760
Thank you, Freddie.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.880
Did you know Benjamin Lightfoot?

24:59.920 --> 25:01.600
No, who's he?

25:01.640 --> 25:03.560
You've been watching us all morning.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.400
And you're locking me up for what, exactly?

25:05.440 --> 25:07.040
Looking at you through binoculars?

25:07.080 --> 25:09.560
DWAYNE: No, for travelling on

25:07.080 --> 25:09.560
a false passport.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.920
We're are locking you up until I find out why

25:09.600 --> 25:12.920
you're so interested

25:12.960 --> 25:14.840
in our investigation.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.720
-He's definitely hiding something.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.720
-ANGELA: I don't doubt it.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.200
The question is does it have anything

25:19.760 --> 25:23.200
to do with the murder?

25:23.240 --> 25:27.280
Well, we've got lots of bits, but nothing that

25:23.240 --> 25:27.280
links them together.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.480
Well, like...

25:30.520 --> 25:33.600
An experienced diver that drowns

25:30.520 --> 25:33.600
in shallow water.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.720
Bruises on his chest and...

25:38.160 --> 25:40.640
international smuggler with a fake passport

25:40.680 --> 25:42.200
and a missing bandana.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.960
That's what the Inspector's really good at.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.240
You know, putting things together

25:49.000 --> 25:51.240
and making sense of them.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.920
You spend a lot of time talking about this Inspector,

25:54.960 --> 25:57.680
which, luckily, isn't annoying at all.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.000
DWAYNE: Uh...

26:01.040 --> 26:05.800
There's something we need to add to the list of things

26:01.040 --> 26:05.800
that don't make sense.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.360
The preliminary autopsy report just came through online.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.880
And?

26:09.920 --> 26:12.840
There was no sea water found in Benjamin Lightfoot's lungs.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.080
Yes, he was drowned, but in fresh water.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.320
Have you, um, got his case file?

26:25.360 --> 26:26.560
Yes.

26:30.880 --> 26:31.880
Autopsy report?

26:35.920 --> 26:39.760
And the autopsy shows that he had only fresh

26:35.920 --> 26:39.760
water in his lungs.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.200
-Mmm-hmm.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.160
Then he must have been drowned elsewhere

26:46.200 --> 26:47.520
and then, um...

26:49.080 --> 26:51.200
you know, his body dumped at sea.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.120
Yes.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.480
Mmm...

27:05.480 --> 27:08.600
Mmm. Who was the last person to see him alive?

27:08.640 --> 27:11.640
His brother and Dwayne.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.360
Oh, yeah. Do we know what was stolen from the dive shed yet?

27:15.400 --> 27:17.560
Nothing.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.000
Why break in if you're not going

27:17.600 --> 27:20.000
to steal anything? I don't know, but we

27:20.040 --> 27:22.440
don't think it's connected.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.800
So there's a break-in at the victim's place of work,

27:25.840 --> 27:28.040
a short time later he's found dead

27:28.080 --> 27:29.480
and it's not connected?

27:29.520 --> 27:32.560
Well, Sergeant Young doesn't seem to think so.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.200
Ah, yes, Sergeant Young. How is she?

27:36.240 --> 27:38.680
-Yes, sir.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.600
I wish Camille was here.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.640
Look, it's vital we get to the bottom of the break-in,

27:45.680 --> 27:47.080
could break open the whole case.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.440
-Okay. -Oh!

27:48.480 --> 27:49.960
And I've been thinking.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.440
About your bandana, I think you're right.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.720
It doesn't make any sense, it having fallen

27:53.480 --> 27:56.720
off in the water.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.160
He dived regularly wearing it

27:58.200 --> 28:01.280
so the one time it falls away is the day he dies. Why?

28:01.320 --> 28:03.360
The struggle, maybe.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.280
Mmm, possibly.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.120
I need to give it some more thought.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.160
I can smell chicken soup.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.120
The, um, plant pot beside you is full of chicken soup.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.520
-It's Camille's mother. She's demented.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.520
-Ooh!

28:21.560 --> 28:24.040
She thinks chicken soup is some kind of wonder drug.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.920
The new penicillin.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.640
She's been force-feeding me.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.760
Would you like me to remove the incriminating evidence,

28:27.680 --> 28:29.760
sir?

28:29.800 --> 28:31.680
Yes, please, Fidel, if you could.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.240
I'd be most grateful.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.800
Did you or your husband know a Danny Barber?

29:34.680 --> 29:36.240
Who?

29:37.480 --> 29:40.280
He's also known as Danny Fernandez.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.440
I don't think so.

29:43.480 --> 29:46.040
-He's a criminal.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.440
A smuggler.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.480
His boat is moored in the marina.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.720
Benjamin never mentioned anyone called Danny.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.760
Hmm.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.880
And did your husband make regular trips overseas?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.200
No.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.600
In fact, I don't think he left the island since I met him.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.200
Um, Abigail?

30:13.240 --> 30:18.160
Sorry, but did Benjamin take a suitcase with

30:13.240 --> 30:18.160
him to the boat?

30:18.200 --> 30:21.480
Knowing Benjamin, I doubt he even

30:18.200 --> 30:21.480
took a toothbrush.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.160
It's just...that blue case up there...

30:26.000 --> 30:28.320
I saw one just like it on Mark's boat.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.240
Well, that can't be.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.040
But they're a pair and only one is there.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.200
His passport, ma'am.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.920
If your brother was only staying with you one night,

30:51.960 --> 30:54.440
why did he pack so many clothes and a passport?

30:59.160 --> 31:03.120
You argued with your brother, didn't you?

31:03.160 --> 31:07.200
You can either tell me the truth

31:03.160 --> 31:07.200
or I can arrest you.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.000
Dwayne, get onto Government House.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.280
We're going to need a warrant to impound this yacht.

31:11.320 --> 31:14.000
All right, wait. I'll tell you.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.600
My brother was a gambler. He owed money.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.200
Is that what you argued about?

31:23.640 --> 31:25.400
He had no sense of responsibility.

31:25.440 --> 31:29.040
He just breezed through life leaving the rest

31:25.440 --> 31:29.040
of us in his wake,

31:29.080 --> 31:30.880
clearing up the mess he left.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.360
I'm not interested in your

31:30.920 --> 31:33.360
brother's shortcomings.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.400
I'm more interested in who he owed money to.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.120
He didn't say.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.520
Well, then why mention it at all?

31:41.560 --> 31:45.280
Because he wanted me to bail him out,

31:41.560 --> 31:45.280
just like he always did.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.560
Marky-boy, I just need a few grand.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.240
You'll get it back, promise. And where am going to get

31:51.280 --> 31:52.920
that sort of money from?

31:52.960 --> 31:55.480
You'll find it. You've done it before.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.360
Not this time, huh?

31:57.400 --> 32:01.320
MARK:<i> I didn't have that sort</i> <i>of money,</i>

31:57.400 --> 32:01.320
<i>so I told him I couldn't.</i>

32:02.080 --> 32:03.920
I wouldn't help him.

32:03.960 --> 32:04.960
So why the suitcase?

32:08.640 --> 32:12.200
He said I was his last chance. He was in serious trouble.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.720
If he couldn't pay the debt, he'd have to leave the island.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.880
His life was in danger.

32:17.920 --> 32:18.920
From whom?

32:20.200 --> 32:22.000
I don't know.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.280
In your statement, you said you were about to

32:22.040 --> 32:24.280
leave for the UK.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.840
Did you agree to take him with you?

32:35.400 --> 32:37.440
So that's it. If he owed money and had gambling debts

32:37.480 --> 32:39.800
and we find out who he owed money to,

32:37.480 --> 32:39.800
we'll find our killer.

32:39.840 --> 32:43.080
Sorry, ma'am. But if you're going to kill someone for

32:39.840 --> 32:43.080
their gambling debts,

32:43.120 --> 32:44.920
do you really go to so much trouble?

32:44.960 --> 32:46.520
Drowning them, dumping them at sea?

32:46.560 --> 32:48.360
Then what's your theory?

32:48.400 --> 32:50.120
-Uh, I don't have one. -I thought not.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.320
Get onto the bank. I want details of his

32:50.160 --> 32:52.320
finances, see how bad it was.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.600
-They've

32:52.360 --> 32:53.600
checked the shed again

32:53.640 --> 32:55.640
and still can't find anything missing.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.800
I'm not interested in the damn shed. That's not what

32:55.680 --> 32:57.800
I sent you for!

33:00.280 --> 33:02.200
Not what you asked me for.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.520
You asked me to find out if they knew Danny Fernandez

33:02.240 --> 33:04.520
and no, they don't.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.600
They'd seen him in the marina before

33:04.560 --> 33:06.600
but never spoken to him.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.720
All right, so of all the people we've questioned,

33:08.760 --> 33:11.200
who would Benjamin Lightfoot most likely be frightened of?

33:11.240 --> 33:13.960
To fear for his life enough to run and leave his

33:11.240 --> 33:13.960
pregnant wife behind?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.480
-Danny Fernandez. -ANGELA: Exactly.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.880
So, Dwayne, you do the bank like I asked.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.400
Freddie, you go down to Danny Fernandez's boat.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.000
I want it searched from top to bottom.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.840
If there's any evidence linking him to Benjamin,

33:20.040 --> 33:22.840
I want it found.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.080
Chop-chop.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.560
What are you doing out of bed?

33:50.920 --> 33:53.920
Just, um, looking for chicken soup.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.440
Oh, so you like it.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.760
It's like an angel crying on my tongue.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.000
Oh!

34:00.040 --> 34:03.040
You seem stronger too, so it must be working.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.440
Yes, yes.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.320
We should alert the Red Cross, hmm?

34:08.360 --> 34:12.160
We could rid the world of famine and disease in

34:08.360 --> 34:12.160
a single stroke.

34:12.200 --> 34:15.080
It'd be known in Brussels as the Chicken Soup Strategy,

34:15.120 --> 34:16.680
no child will ever cry again.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.680
I told her you were ill so she's on her way home.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.120
She'll be here in a few hours.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.920
You've missed her.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.120
Well, I mean, that's...

34:32.160 --> 34:35.360
That's to say, you know, the fact that she isn't here

34:32.160 --> 34:35.360
is, you know, not ideal.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.320
So in that sense, uh...

34:39.160 --> 34:42.120
Why can't you Brits ever just say

34:39.160 --> 34:42.120
how you feel?

34:42.160 --> 34:44.680
-We can. -Go on, then.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.960
Just say something.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.760
Don't think about it first. You let it out.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.480
Okay.

34:55.080 --> 34:58.600
Your soup tastes like old socks

34:58.640 --> 35:02.160
that have been marinated in diesel,

34:58.640 --> 35:02.160
sprinkled with urine

35:02.200 --> 35:04.360
and baked for three days covered in a sack

35:04.400 --> 35:06.440
that's been used to wipe a donkey's backside!

35:11.120 --> 35:12.120
Hmm!

35:15.200 --> 35:17.560
No secret compartments on Danny's boat anywhere.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.040
Or stashes of cash or contraband.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.240
The only thing I found is a set of scales.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.400
But no drugs.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.640
No, the diving equipment hasn't been used for years.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.640
The air tank's all seized up, the rubber's all split.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.120
Okay. Mmm-hmm, I'll catch you later.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.120
No problem.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.360
Got the bank statements.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.360
The full autopsy report came in.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.760
The wounds on the victim's chest had tiny shards

35:40.400 --> 35:43.760
of metal in them.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.480
And there was a stone lodged in his oesophagus.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.480
-That's not the only thing that's weird.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.720
The Lightfoot account looks quite healthy

35:54.760 --> 35:56.720
for someone who owed a lot of money.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.480
But there are two transactions in there.

35:58.520 --> 36:01.440
$25,000 paid into his account two weeks ago,

36:01.480 --> 36:04.240
then taken out in cash the next day.

36:04.280 --> 36:07.720
It was paid from an account held by Alex Owen.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.040
FIDEL: You know, I don't get it.

36:15.080 --> 36:18.680
Why would Alex Owen give Benjamin $25,000?

36:18.720 --> 36:22.200
Well, he asked his brother for help,

36:18.720 --> 36:22.200
why not his boss's wife?

36:22.240 --> 36:24.280
Okay, but then why didn't she mention it?

36:24.320 --> 36:27.480
I mean, 25,000 is a lot of money. You know what I

36:24.320 --> 36:27.480
could do with that?

36:27.520 --> 36:30.720
The other thing is he took the money out of

36:27.520 --> 36:30.720
the bank in cash.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.040
So it must have been to pay off his gambling debts.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.920
-Maybe. -Not maybe.

36:37.080 --> 36:41.560
Because when you lose money gambling, the kind of people

36:37.080 --> 36:41.560
you owe the money to,

36:41.600 --> 36:43.000
they don't like to take cheques.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.000
Okay, well, then one thing still bugs me.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.160
Only one?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.840
He told his brother Mark that he owed money

36:47.880 --> 36:50.040
and that if he didn't pay it off,

36:47.880 --> 36:50.040
he feared for his life, right?

36:50.080 --> 36:52.040
-Yet that was after Mrs Owen

36:52.080 --> 36:54.000
had given him the 25,000.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.640
So if he paid off his gambling debts,

36:55.680 --> 36:58.800
the only other person he owed money

36:55.680 --> 36:58.800
to was Alex Owen.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.840
Said it was a one-off, it wouldn't happen again,

37:03.880 --> 37:06.680
but he owed all this money,

37:06.720 --> 37:09.880
he didn't dare tell Abigail because she'd kill him.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.200
Obviously, I don't mean...

37:11.240 --> 37:13.160
You gave him money to pay his debts off?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.640
No, she gave all our savings to pay his debts off.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.680
Every penny we had.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.480
Why didn't you tell us this earlier?

37:20.520 --> 37:23.600
Well, because I was trying to spare

37:20.520 --> 37:23.600
Abigail any more pain.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.120
It's all connected, isn't it? It's got to be to

37:23.640 --> 37:26.120
do with his debts.

37:26.160 --> 37:30.400
-After Benjamin was killed.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.160
Now, don't get any ideas.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.160
I'm not being cleaned out and being accused of murder,

37:34.200 --> 37:36.240
not in the same week.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.560
Did Benjamin ever say if he planned to pay you back?

37:38.600 --> 37:41.280
He said he wouldn't rest until he paid

37:38.600 --> 37:41.280
back every dollar.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.960
-Yes!

37:46.040 --> 37:50.120
Phil Owen has a fresh water vat

37:46.040 --> 37:50.120
in his dive shed.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.600
DWAYNE: True. I never thought of that.

37:54.200 --> 37:58.520
That's why I'm a Detective Sergeant

37:54.200 --> 37:58.520
and you're not.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.760
-Shh.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.560
There was clearly a struggle,

38:05.600 --> 38:09.400
During which he'd have to be held face down

38:05.600 --> 38:09.400
with some force...

38:09.440 --> 38:11.680
which would explain marks on his chest.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.520
As for the stone lodged in his oesophagus,

38:14.560 --> 38:17.880
lots of stones on the seabed where the body was found.

38:17.920 --> 38:22.360
The key is the money Benjamin owed, the money he

38:17.920 --> 38:22.360
begged his brother for.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.960
The only thing that makes sense is that

38:24.000 --> 38:26.560
Phil Owen lied about not finding

38:24.000 --> 38:26.560
out about the money

38:26.600 --> 38:28.440
until after Benjamin was dead.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.800
He'd then went back to get it. We know Benjamin

38:28.480 --> 38:30.800
didn't have it.

38:30.840 --> 38:36.600
So after a furious row, Phil Owen killed

38:30.840 --> 38:36.600
Benjamin Lightfoot

38:36.640 --> 38:39.840
by holding him under water in his fresh water barrel!

38:39.880 --> 38:41.400
What about

38:39.880 --> 38:41.400
the guy in the cells?

38:41.440 --> 38:43.240
There's nothing that links

38:41.440 --> 38:43.240
him to the victim.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.040
Therefore, he's nothing more than a distraction.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
It has to be Philip Owen.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.040
FIDEL: Are you sure this is a good idea?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.480
DWAYNE: Look, the Chief needs to know we're about

38:52.080 --> 38:54.480
to make an arrest.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.880
Um, Dwayne, one thing before we go in.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.400
You've been feeding him information on the quiet.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.120
But how did you know?

39:08.160 --> 39:10.400
Because so have I.

39:10.440 --> 39:13.680
Only I didn't bring a bag of fruit

39:10.440 --> 39:13.680
every time I went.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.920
FIDEL: Sir?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.160
So, why are you here?

39:36.200 --> 39:38.440
Uh, Sergeant Young is about to make an arrest.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.760
We thought you should know.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.800
Well, then, you must tell me who it...

39:47.320 --> 39:49.800
He's done too much, he's wiped out.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.280
We should leave. Let him sleep.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.560
No, wait, he's back.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.280
Mmm.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.600
Where was I?

40:01.960 --> 40:04.000
Oh, yes.

40:04.040 --> 40:08.120
You were about to tell me who you think killed

40:04.040 --> 40:08.120
Benjamin Lightfoot.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.880
Yes.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.840
Right, so, Sergeant Young thinks

40:09.920 --> 40:12.840
it could only be one person.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.600
That's what I believe, too.

40:19.240 --> 40:20.920
It was Phil Owen.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.720
-And he's gone again. -No, he's listening.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.520
Taking it all in.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.520
So Phil's the killer.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.320
Well, we'd better arrest him for murder, then.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.880
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.600
Perhaps you could help me get dressed.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.160
Uh, Dwayne, drop us at the station

40:51.200 --> 40:54.360
and then I need you to go and get a couple of things for me.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.160
I'm not... I'm not dead yet, thank you.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.800
At first sight, it was a baffling case.

40:59.840 --> 41:03.080
Yet all it needed was dogged determination,

40:59.840 --> 41:03.080
a little police work

41:03.120 --> 41:05.600
and an instinct for the truth.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.720
Hmm. In the final analysis, Benjamin Lightfoot's murderer

41:08.760 --> 41:10.880
could only be one person.

41:10.920 --> 41:16.560
The only person here with the means,

41:10.920 --> 41:16.560
motive and opportunity.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.640
RICHARD: I couldn't agree more.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.800
Mark Lightfoot, I'm arresting you on suspicion

41:21.840 --> 41:25.200
of the murder of your brother, Benjamin Lightfoot.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.480
What? This is a madness. Philip, do something.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.040
FIDEL: You do not have to say anything

41:28.520 --> 41:31.040
but it may harm your defence

41:31.080 --> 41:34.280
if you do not mention when questioned something you

41:31.080 --> 41:34.280
later rely on in court.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.840
Anything you do say may be given as evidence.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.840
Do you understand? Will someone please explain

41:36.880 --> 41:39.400
to me what's going on?

41:42.120 --> 41:44.120
Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.360
We haven't met but I've heard

41:44.160 --> 41:47.360
a lot about you.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.520
I apologise for the dramatic nature

41:47.400 --> 41:50.520
of my arrival

41:50.560 --> 41:54.320
but I felt compelled to drag myself from my sickbed to

41:50.560 --> 41:54.320
prevent a grave injustice.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.760
And of course to arrest Mark here

41:54.360 --> 41:56.760
for the murder of his brother.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.240
He can't be the murderer.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.280
I saw him on the boat when Benjamin went diving.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.680
And so did one of your officers.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.080
Yeah, it was him.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.600
No. You only thought you saw Benjamin that morning.

42:06.640 --> 42:10.120
In fact, that's rather the point.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.280
Did you tell your brother the real reason

42:10.160 --> 42:12.280
you were sailing

42:12.320 --> 42:14.520
for the UK that day or did he already know?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.800
I have no idea what you're talking about.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.560
RICHARD: I think you do.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.960
You're a smuggler, Mr Lightfoot,

42:18.600 --> 42:20.960
aren't you?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.760
Once a year you sail that boat to the UK.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.320
That's what you told my officers,

42:22.800 --> 42:25.320
isn't it?

42:25.360 --> 42:27.240
And you crew boats all over the Caribbean.

42:27.280 --> 42:32.720
That's how you met Danny Barber, or Fernandez,

42:27.280 --> 42:32.720
as we now know he is.

42:32.760 --> 42:37.240
Or is it a coincidence that a suspected smuggler is in

42:32.760 --> 42:37.240
the bay of Honore

42:37.280 --> 42:40.920
the same day you're leaving for the UK?

42:40.960 --> 42:44.920
Though as any detective worth their

42:40.960 --> 42:44.920
salt will tell you,

42:44.960 --> 42:48.800
there's no such thing as coincidence in a murder

42:44.960 --> 42:48.800
investigation. Fidel.

42:48.840 --> 42:51.840
The scales on Mr Fernandez's boat

42:48.840 --> 42:51.840
confused us.

42:53.560 --> 42:57.040
There was no trace of drugs, even in lab tests.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.920
The drugs were only one of the things Mr Fernandez was

42:57.080 --> 43:00.920
known to deal in,

43:00.960 --> 43:04.160
the others being guns and conflict diamonds.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.400
Like this one.

43:06.440 --> 43:10.560
Found lodged in the oesophagus of the victim.

43:12.520 --> 43:15.560
Uncut, so they still look like stones,

43:15.600 --> 43:18.840
but easy enough to identify with a little basic research.

43:18.880 --> 43:21.120
Uh, I was waiting on a lab report.

43:23.400 --> 43:29.840
Once we knew what the stone was,

43:23.400 --> 43:29.840
the rest suddenly made sense.

43:29.880 --> 43:33.960
'Cause the way you got them through UK Customs was

43:29.880 --> 43:33.960
really quite brilliant.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.720
They weren't even hidden.

43:39.760 --> 43:42.720
You're wrong. If those are diamonds, I have no idea

43:39.760 --> 43:42.720
how they got there.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.200
I think you're lying.

43:45.240 --> 43:48.160
I also think that when your brother

43:45.240 --> 43:48.160
discovered what they were

43:48.200 --> 43:50.920
and tried to take some of them to pay his debts,

43:50.960 --> 43:53.120
you pushed his head into the fish tank

43:50.960 --> 43:53.120
and held him there.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.160
No.

43:55.200 --> 43:59.040
RICHARD: In his struggle to breathe, this stone became

43:55.200 --> 43:59.040
lodged in his throat.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.960
I can't be sure but it certainly explains

44:02.000 --> 44:04.400
the shape of the wounds on his chest

44:04.440 --> 44:06.520
and why there were metal shards

44:04.440 --> 44:06.520
embedded in them.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.520
Metal, by the way, not plastic,

44:08.560 --> 44:11.600
as it stated quite clearly in the lab report, I believe.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.640
It also explains the one thing you didn't consider

44:13.680 --> 44:16.520
when you dumped his body into the sea,

44:16.560 --> 44:18.480
why his lungs were full of fresh water.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.240
Ah!

44:22.320 --> 44:23.760
Mr Fernandez.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.720
At the moment you're charged with possession of

44:26.160 --> 44:28.720
a counterfeit passport

44:28.760 --> 44:32.040
and illegal movement of conflict diamonds.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.040
What you have to decide

44:34.080 --> 44:37.200
is whether you want to add accessory to

44:34.080 --> 44:37.200
murder to that list.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.880
-Oh, so you do know him.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.840
Question is will the jury believe you

44:43.880 --> 44:45.520
when you tell them you're not a murderer?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.960
All right.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.040
It was his idea to use the catamaran, the fish tank.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.040
He approached me.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.640
I'll tell you everything.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.480
I had nothing to do with the killing

44:54.680 --> 44:56.480
of his brother.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.200
I still don't understand. I saw him.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.120
By the time you saw Benjamin go diving,

45:00.760 --> 45:04.120
he was already dead.

45:08.080 --> 45:12.120
You were forced to admit that you'd argued with your brother

45:13.160 --> 45:15.000
the night he was murdered.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.160
As you didn't know what had been overheard,

45:19.200 --> 45:21.800
you decided to tell us the truth.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.520
<i>You didn't tell us</i> <i>what happened next, did you?</i>

45:24.560 --> 45:26.960
...a few grand. You'll get it back, promise.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.880
And where am going to get that sort of money from?

45:28.920 --> 45:31.400
You'll find it. You've done it before.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.360
Not this time, huh? Not this time.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.360
Come on, big brother, you know I mean it.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.240
Just drink your drink, all right?

45:39.680 --> 45:43.240
After a night of heavy drinking, emotions ran high,

45:39.680 --> 45:43.240
tempers flared,

45:43.280 --> 45:45.760
you started to fight over the diamonds.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.280
Look at the diamond!

45:56.920 --> 45:59.120
RICHARD:<i> All those years</i> <i>of resentment, hmm?</i>

46:00.640 --> 46:02.560
<i>A little brother</i> <i>who breezed through life,</i>

46:02.600 --> 46:04.760
<i>leaving you in his wake</i> <i>to clear up his mess.</i>

46:17.240 --> 46:20.160
I doubt we'll ever know if you meant to kill your

46:17.240 --> 46:20.160
brother that day.

46:20.200 --> 46:24.480
But once you realised that you had, you knew you had to

46:20.200 --> 46:24.480
dispose of his body.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.160
And I have to say

46:29.160 --> 46:31.240
your plan was ingenious.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.280
The first part

46:33.320 --> 46:36.320
was to get him into some of the boat's scuba kit,

46:36.360 --> 46:38.680
then get his body onto the dinghy.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.520
<i>You thought it would look</i> <i>like a tragic diving accident.</i>

46:43.600 --> 46:45.440
<i>After all,</i> <i>what else could it be?</i>

46:46.800 --> 46:48.240
<i>Your first mistake</i> <i>was in not realising</i>

46:48.280 --> 46:50.920
<i>that his lungs would</i> <i>be full of fresh water.</i>

46:50.960 --> 46:54.160
<i>The second was in forgetting</i> <i>to turn on his air tank.</i>

46:54.200 --> 46:57.080
<i>Once you dumped</i> <i>his body in the sea,</i>

46:54.200 --> 46:57.080
<i>you came back.</i>

46:57.120 --> 46:59.640
<i>It was you that broke into</i> <i>Phil's dive shed, wasn't it?</i>

46:59.680 --> 47:02.760
<i>And now we understand why</i> <i>it looked like</i>

46:59.680 --> 47:02.760
<i>nothing had been stolen,</i>

47:02.800 --> 47:05.560
<i>because nothing had.</i>

47:05.600 --> 47:10.200
You simply needed a police officer there for the final

47:05.600 --> 47:10.200
piece of the jigsaw.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.800
You disposed of your brother's body at sea under

47:12.000 --> 47:14.800
cover of darkness.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.040
But in order to get away with his murder,

47:18.080 --> 47:20.760
you needed to prove he was still alive.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.480
So you impersonated him.

47:24.360 --> 47:28.440
<i>Making sure you put on</i> <i>one of his</i>

47:24.360 --> 47:28.440
<i>trademark red bandanas.</i>

47:28.480 --> 47:31.320
<i>Because in scuba gear,</i> <i>it would be hard to tell</i>

47:28.480 --> 47:31.320
<i>two people apart,</i>

47:32.880 --> 47:36.000
<i>let alone two brothers</i> <i>of a similar age and build.</i>

47:36.040 --> 47:40.160
Hey, didn't think I'd see you until noon!

47:40.200 --> 47:42.480
DWAYNE: <i>And as long as you spoke</i>

47:40.200 --> 47:42.480
<i>through the snorkel,</i>

47:42.520 --> 47:44.160
<i>you'd even sound the same.</i>

47:59.960 --> 48:03.760
<i>I mean, why would anyone think</i> <i>anything</i>

47:59.960 --> 48:03.760
<i>suspicious was happening?</i>

48:03.800 --> 48:07.080
<i>At that stage, nobody knew</i> <i>anything</i>

48:03.800 --> 48:07.080
<i>suspicious had happened.</i>

48:13.520 --> 48:17.360
<i>You wasn't being clumsy</i> <i>when you dropped and</i>

48:13.520 --> 48:17.360
<i>smashed that bottle,</i>

48:17.400 --> 48:19.640
<i>you was cleverly proving</i> <i>that you were on that boat</i>

48:19.680 --> 48:21.640
<i>after your</i> <i>brother had left it.</i>

48:21.680 --> 48:23.000
Good night?

48:23.040 --> 48:24.680
DWAYNE:<i> So how could</i> <i>you be the murderer?</i>

48:24.720 --> 48:26.520
<i>The murder</i> <i>hadn't happened yet.</i>

48:26.560 --> 48:29.840
<i>Your brother was still alive,</i> <i>or so everyone would think.</i>

48:31.360 --> 48:33.200
RICHARD: I asked Dwayne to pick up

48:31.360 --> 48:33.200
not just the fish tank

48:33.240 --> 48:37.200
but also to look through the trash

48:33.240 --> 48:37.200
that you put out that day.

48:37.240 --> 48:41.560
'Cause inside there was one clue that broke

48:37.240 --> 48:41.560
the whole case wide open.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.560
Benjamin had never appeared without his red bandana

48:43.600 --> 48:45.880
before the day that he was murdered.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.520
Why was that?

48:47.560 --> 48:50.400
You see, that really bugged me.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.200
Until I realised that you'd remembered to wear it

48:53.240 --> 48:56.040
when you impersonated him that morning

48:56.080 --> 48:59.120
but in your panic to dispose of the body, you hadn't.

49:00.280 --> 49:02.240
So...

49:02.280 --> 49:06.920
the bandana, the marks on his chest, the stone,

49:02.280 --> 49:06.920
the fresh water in his lungs,

49:06.960 --> 49:08.920
the break-in at the dive shed.

49:08.960 --> 49:12.720
All the things that individually make no sense,

49:12.760 --> 49:15.720
but when you put them all together,

49:12.760 --> 49:15.720
they all add up to one fact,

49:15.760 --> 49:19.680
that you murdered your brother Benjamin and disposed of

49:15.760 --> 49:19.680
his body in the sea.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.200
Lock him up, Fidel.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.400
Mark, how could you?

49:30.960 --> 49:32.360
He was your brother.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.200
And I hated him.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.880
My whole life I hated him and none of you

49:34.240 --> 49:36.880
can understand.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.880
You just laugh at me,

49:38.920 --> 49:41.640
the brother who wasn't as cool or as interesting.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.560
My whole life, people, they would run

49:43.000 --> 49:45.560
around after him.

49:45.600 --> 49:50.120
I run around after him clearing up his mistakes,

49:45.600 --> 49:50.120
paying his debts,

49:50.160 --> 49:53.120
letting him use me. But you never

49:50.160 --> 49:53.120
saw that, did you?

49:53.840 --> 49:55.800
Nobody noticed me.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.840
My sincere condolences, Mrs Lightfoot.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.720
And the suitcase?

50:03.760 --> 50:08.000
All Mark. Intended to throw

50:03.760 --> 50:08.000
us off the scent.

50:08.040 --> 50:09.760
He must have packed it when he went to the house,

50:09.800 --> 50:12.560
supposedly to tell you about your husband's death.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.920
I knew he wouldn't leave me.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.280
Sorry, is that what you were going to say?

50:23.280 --> 50:24.880
You know damn well it wasn't.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.200
Yes, I did know that,

50:27.240 --> 50:30.320
but that's why I'm a Detective Inspector

50:27.240 --> 50:30.320
and you're not.

50:42.280 --> 50:46.400
FIDEL: So, we caught a murderer and an international

50:42.280 --> 50:46.400
diamond smuggler.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.480
That's a good day.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.920
Yes, it is.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.840
I'm not sure Sergeant Young was too pleased.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.320
I'm sorry, but she wasn't very nice.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.720
Don't worry, Freddie, she's gone now.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.960
RICHARD: Uh-oh, that doesn't look good.

51:07.200 --> 51:10.160
I have just got off a nine-hour flight

51:07.200 --> 51:10.160
and what do I get?

51:10.200 --> 51:12.320
Virtually, as the plane hits the tarmac,

51:12.360 --> 51:15.600
my mother on the phone saying you've insulted her?

51:15.640 --> 51:19.360
Well, I didn't insult her. It was more critique.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.440
You said her soup tasted of old socks!

51:22.480 --> 51:24.520
She told me to be honest.

51:24.560 --> 51:27.000
When women tell you to be honest, it doesn't mean

51:24.560 --> 51:27.000
they want you to be honest.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.200
Well, what sense does that make?

51:28.240 --> 51:30.000
It doesn't have to make any sense.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.240
-We're talking about my mother.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.240
-She was force-feeding me.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.200
I could have reported her for aggravated assault.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.800
-I grew up on chicken soup. -That explains a lot.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.080
What is that supposed to mean?

51:38.120 --> 51:39.680
FIDEL: Looks like things are back to normal, then.

51:39.720 --> 51:40.880
DWAYNE: Amen to that.

51:40.920 --> 51:42.560
FIDEL: Fancy a beer?

51:42.600 --> 51:44.400
RICHARD: Well, it's clearly made you very argumentative,

51:42.600 --> 51:44.400
for a start.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.360
CAMILLE: I'm argumentative?

51:46.400 --> 51:49.080
RICHARD: Well, excuse me, but while you were swanning

51:46.400 --> 51:49.080
around in Paris,

51:49.120 --> 51:52.000
I was solving a murder from my sick bed.

51:52.040 --> 51:56.120
CAMILLE: From what I've heard, Dwayne and Fidel

51:52.040 --> 51:56.120
did all the hard work.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.760
RICHARD: Is all this really about your

51:56.160 --> 51:58.760
mother's chicken soup?

51:58.800 --> 52:01.360
CAMILLE: No, all of this is because you are a...
