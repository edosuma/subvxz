00:01.602 --> 00:03.704
NEXT TIME YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD ON TO YOUR GIRL

00:03.737 --> 00:05.239
A LITTLE TIGHTER,

00:05.273 --> 00:06.774
HA HA.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.177

00:30.498 --> 00:32.333

* NO WONDER YOUR GIRLFRIEND

01:32.660 --> 01:35.363
* SHE WANTED A REAL MAN,
THAT'S ME, THAT'S IT *

01:35.396 --> 01:36.830
* NEVER SLIP, NEVER FALL

01:36.864 --> 01:38.699
* I'M-A KICK YOU WHEN YOU DOWN

01:38.732 --> 01:40.501

01:42.936 --> 01:45.673
* I AIN'T GOT TIME TO KILL, I'M
FOR REAL WITH THE GLOCK, RAH *

01:45.706 --> 01:48.676
* LOOK AT ME NOW,
SHE'S ROLLIN' WITH A "G" *

01:48.709 --> 01:51.545
* SHE USED TO BE YOURS,
NOW SHE ROLLIN' WITH ME *

* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

01:52.580 --> 01:54.182
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

01:54.215 --> 01:56.850
* SHE'S WITH ME TONIGHT

01:56.884 --> 01:59.620
* LOOK AT ME NOW,
SHE'S ROLLIN' WITH A "G" *

01:59.653 --> 02:02.190
* SHE USED TO BE YOURS,
NOW SHE ROLLIN' WITH ME *

02:02.223 --> 02:03.191
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

02:03.224 --> 02:04.692
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

02:04.725 --> 02:07.795
* SHE'S WITH ME TONIGHT

02:07.828 --> 02:10.731
* LOOK AT ME NOW,
SHE'S ROLLIN' WITH A "G" *
Provenza:
FLYNN, TURN THAT OFF!

02:10.764 --> 02:13.234
* SHE USED TO BE YOURS,
NOW SHE ROLLIN' WITH ME *

02:13.267 --> 02:14.835
* OKAY, ALL RI--
FLYNN!

02:17.605 --> 02:20.308
911 DIALED AT 2:07 A.M.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.210
Sanchez: BUT NO OFFICERS
WERE DISPATCHED HERE

02:22.243 --> 02:24.678
UNTIL THE MAIDS CAME TO WORK
THIS MORNING.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.680
MAYBE THE CALL
DIDN'T GO THROUGH.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.716
SO WE HAVE SEVEN VICTIMS
SHOT TO DEATH --

02:28.749 --> 02:30.784
FIVE YOUNG MEN,
TWO YOUNG LADIES.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.253
DO WE KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.554
THE GUYS ALL HAD I.D.,

02:33.587 --> 02:35.489
BUT THE GIRLS
ONLY HAD BUSINESS CARDS.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.225
YEAH,
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR LADIES

02:37.258 --> 02:40.561
ARE FROM THE SAME MODELING
AGENCY -- HOLLYWOOD TEASE.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.864
THIS IS CANDY
ON THE COUCH.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.334
AND YOU ARE WITH DELIGHT.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.202
Brenda:
LOOKS LIKE THIS MASSACRE

02:48.236 --> 02:49.403
BEGAN WITH THE TWO GUYS
AT THE DOOR.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.971
Sanchez:
THEY GOT C-STREET TATS.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.507
MEANS THEY'RE
CLINTON STREET CRIPS.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.908
PROBABLY THE SECURITY TEAM,

02:54.942 --> 02:56.610
BUT THEY NEVER EVEN
DREW THEIR WEAPONS.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.246
SO THEY EITHER KNEW THE GUY,
OR IT WAS A PROFESSIONAL HIT,

02:58.279 --> 03:00.648
WHICH EXPLAINS
WHY THERE ARE NO CASINGS.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.982
AND WHO ARE THESE
YOUNG MEN?

03:02.015 --> 03:06.420
WELL, THE RAPPER'S NAME
WAS CHRISTOPHER BROOKS.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.655
CHRIS BROOKS.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.291
Flynn:
A.K.A. "C-GAME."

03:10.324 --> 03:12.626
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD HIS NEW SINGLE
FOR FREE.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.927
Provenza: GANG MEMBERS,

03:13.961 --> 03:14.962
EMPTY VODKA BOTTLES,

03:14.995 --> 03:16.430
JOINTS IN THE ASHTRAY,

03:16.464 --> 03:17.831
HALF-NAKED GIRLS --

03:17.865 --> 03:20.268
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE A MURDER
HAD TO HAPPEN.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.570
IS THIS C

03:22.603 --> 03:23.871
Sanchez:
NEVER HEARD OF HIM, CHIEF.

03:23.904 --> 03:24.738
HE'S PROBABLY MORE
OF AN UP-AND-COMER.

03:24.772 --> 03:25.873
THEN WHO LIVES HERE?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.875
LIEUTENANT TAO,
WOULD YOU PLEASE

03:27.908 --> 03:29.843
LOOK UP THE TITLE
ON THE HOUSE?

03:32.480 --> 03:33.781
Gabriel:
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.017
OH, MY GOD,
I KNOW TWO OF THESE GUYS.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.652
THEY'RE BROTHERS.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.920
THEIR FATHER IS A DEACON
AT MY CHURCH.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.855
BOTH HIS KIDS, MAN --
THAT'S --

03:41.889 --> 03:43.457
LOOK --
THEY ARE NOT GANG.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.294
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN THEM?

03:46.327 --> 03:48.429
UH, I GUESS SINCE
THEY WENT OFF TO COLLEGE,

03:48.462 --> 03:49.930
BUT, I MEAN, I SEE THEIR FAMILY
ALL THE TIME.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.699
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.
IT'S JUST --

03:51.732 --> 03:53.567
GABRIEL, LOOK -- WE'VE GOT DRUGS
AND STRIPPERS HERE.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.670
THESE GUYS MAY HAVE
BEEN SKIPPING SUNDAY
SCHOOL LATELY, OKAY?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.339
RIGHT,
THEY SMOKED A LITTLE POT.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.441
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN --

04:00.474 --> 04:02.476
YOU HAVE THEIR I.D.s.
ARE THESE GUYS FROM
CLINTON STREET, TOO?

04:02.510 --> 04:05.679
YEAH, BUT NOT EVERY BLACK KID
ON CLINTON STREET IS A CRIP.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.348
YOU KNOW THAT.
Flynn:
OH, COME ON, GABRIEL.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.283
THIS KID CHRIS
CALLED HIMSELF "C-GAME."

04:09.317 --> 04:10.484
THAT'S SLANG FOR "COCAINE."

04:10.518 --> 04:11.952
I KNOW
WHAT THE NAME MEANS!

04:11.985 --> 04:13.521
ALL RIGHT.
HE WON'T HAVE A RECORD.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.788
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK IT UP. LOOK HIM --

04:14.822 --> 04:16.790
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.793
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
DETECTIVE GABRIEL,

04:19.827 --> 04:21.395
WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK OUT
THE REST OF THE HOUSE,

04:21.429 --> 04:22.396
SEE WHAT ELSE
WE CAN FIND?

04:22.430 --> 04:24.665
THANK YOU.

04:26.467 --> 04:31.305
9 TIMES OUT OF 10, CHIEF,
RAP MEANS GANGS.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.306
AND GANGS
USUALLY MEANS DRUGS.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.607
WELL, THAT MAY BE TRUE,

04:33.641 --> 04:35.576
BUT IN THE INTEREST
OF A UNIFIED APPROACH,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.645
LET'S TRY NOT TO JUMP TO
CONCLUSIONS. THANK YOU.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.413
THE L.A.P.D. HAS A JOINT
TASK FORCE WITH THE FBI

04:39.447 --> 04:41.014
LOOKING INTO
THE RAP BUSINESS.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.484
THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA GRAB
THIS CASE, ANYWAY, CHIEF.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.587
AND CHIEF DELK ANNOUNCES
HIS REORGANIZATION
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.721
Provenza:
YEAH. WHO KNOWS?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.022
MAJOR CRIMES
MAY ALREADY BE

04:49.056 --> 04:50.758
A THING OF THE PAST.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.862
TITLE ON THE HOUSE BELONGS TO
A COMPANY CALLED SHANKED, INC.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.397
Sanchez: SHANKED?

04:56.430 --> 04:57.898
THAT'S A RECORD LABEL --
HANDLES LOTS OF RAPPERS.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.667
Brenda: I NEED TO SPEAK
TO SOMEONE FROM SHANKED

04:59.700 --> 05:02.536
ABOUT THE SLAUGHTER
IN THEIR LIVING ROOM.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.406
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF
ON THE FLOOR?
Tao: FOAM.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.707
SOME SORT OF
INSULATION MATERIAL.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.108
I ALREADY SENT OFF
A FEW PICTURES TO S.I.D.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.846
CHIEF, BUZZ,
WE FOUND SOMETHING.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.551
OH.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.623
IS THIS C

05:22.656 --> 05:24.492
NO, THIS STUFF BELONGS
TO HIS BROTHER, KEVIN.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.699
IT STILL DOESN'T PROVE
THEY WERE GANG.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.602
DAVID, SINCE ALL THESE BOYS
LIVED IN CLINTON

05:34.635 --> 05:35.803
AND YOU'RE ACQUAINTED

05:35.836 --> 05:37.070
WITH CHRIS AND KEVIN'S
PARENTS --

05:37.104 --> 05:38.706
YOU WANT ME TO DO
THE NOTIFICATION.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.340
YES, PLEASE. THANK YOU.
I KNOW YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.144
SO, LIEUTENANT, HOW MUCH
WOULD YOU SAY IS HERE?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.646
I HAD PROPERTY COUNT IT.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.716
THE TOTAL'S $750,000
ON THE NOSE.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.585
WELL, LIKE WE SAID,
RAP MEANS GANGS.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.920
GANGS MEANS DRUGS.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.588
BUT IF IT WAS A DRUG DEAL
GONE SIDEWAYS,

05:54.622 --> 05:55.789
WHY MURDER SEVEN PEOPLE

05:55.823 --> 05:56.990
AND LEAVE THE CASH BEHIND?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.826
AS TO THE, UH,
TWO YOUNG LADIES,

05:58.859 --> 06:03.431
WE HAVE MICHELLE SIMPSON,
A.K.A. "CANDY," 19,

06:03.464 --> 06:05.098
SEATTLE,

06:05.132 --> 06:09.903
AND RENA WATKINS,
A.K.A. "DELIGHT," 20,

06:09.937 --> 06:11.872
DETROIT.

06:11.905 --> 06:15.108
AND MAYBE GABRIEL CAN TELL US
ABOUT OUR CLINTON STREET BOYS.

06:16.777 --> 06:17.945
DAVID?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.813
YES?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.749
OH, YES, UH...

06:21.782 --> 06:23.150
CHRISTOPHER BROOKS,

06:23.183 --> 06:24.585
A.K.A. "C-GAME,"

06:24.618 --> 06:26.920
GOT HIS DEGREE IN MUSIC
FROM UCLA.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.457
AND HIS BROTHER,
KEVIN BROOKS,

06:29.490 --> 06:32.593
GRADUATED USC
WITH A DEGREE IN ECONOMICS.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.927
HIS PARENTS SAID
THAT NEITHER ONE OF THEM

06:33.961 --> 06:35.563
HAVE EVER BEEN INVOLVED
WITH GANGS.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.732
BUT THEY'RE BOTH ON
THE RECORD COMPANY'S PAYROLL.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.669
SHANKED, OWNED
BY ANTWONE DECKER,

06:41.702 --> 06:44.505
LIFELONG CRIP,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.039
WITH A SHEET TO PROVE IT --

06:46.073 --> 06:47.508
DRUGS, EXTORTION,
PROBABLY WORSE, CHIEF.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.009
Brenda: WELL,
IF HE OWNS THE COMPANY,

06:49.042 --> 06:52.012
HE ALSO OWNS THE HOUSE
WHERE WE FOUND OUR VICTIMS.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.448
LET'S INVITE MR. DECKER IN
FOR A CHAT, PLEASE.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.954
Tao: GABRIEL'S RIGHT --

07:00.988 --> 07:03.657
NO CRIMINAL RECORD FOR KEVIN
OR CHRIS, A.K.A. "C-GAME."

07:03.691 --> 07:06.093
BUT I GOT HIS BIO OFF
THE SHANKED RECORDS WEBSITE.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.229
IT SAYS HIS DEBUT ALBUM
DROPS NEXT WEEK.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.998
AND ACCORDING TO THIS,

07:11.031 --> 07:12.866
HIS BROTHER, KEVIN,
WAS HIS MANAGER.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.069
Taylor: UH,

07:16.103 --> 07:19.106
JUST PACKING A FEW OF MY BOXES
BACK HERE.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.476
SORRY, IT -- IT SLIPPED.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.778
YEAH.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.483
WE HAVE THIS, CHIEF --

07:29.517 --> 07:31.585
COPY OF THE 911 CALL
FROM LAST NIGHT.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.188
WOMAN: 911.
What's your emergency?

07:35.222 --> 07:38.826
Hello?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.694
911.
What's your emergency?

07:40.728 --> 07:43.063
Tao: COMMUNICATIONS
NEVER LOCATED THE SIGNAL,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.231
SO IT WAS CLASSIFIED
AS "UNKNOWN TROUBLE."

07:44.264 --> 07:45.599
HAVE YOU FOUND
ANYTHING ELSE USEFUL

07:45.633 --> 07:46.834
FROM THE VICTIMS'
CELLPHONES?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.268
OH, THE GIRLS GIVE US

07:48.301 --> 07:51.271
A PRETTY DETAILED TIMELINE
ON THE NIGHT.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.875
10:45 P.M.,

07:54.908 --> 07:56.744
RENA TEXTS HER SERVICE

07:56.777 --> 07:59.580
THAT SHE AND MICHELLE
HAVE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.981
11:51 P.M.,

08:01.014 --> 08:03.517
MICHELLE DOWNLOADS
C-GAME'S SINGLE.

08:03.551 --> 08:07.187
11:58 TO 12:09,
THEY TAKE PICTURES.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.859
12:16 A.M.,

08:11.892 --> 08:14.962
SOMEONE ORDERS PIZZAS
FROM MICHELLE'S PHONE.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.730
AND THEN AT 2:07 A.M.,

08:16.764 --> 08:18.866
RENA SENDS HER LAST CALL
TO 911.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.943
JUST GOT AN ADVANCED COPY

08:29.977 --> 08:31.612
OF THE DEPARTMENT'S
NEW ORGANIZATIONAL CHART.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.946
DELK MAKES THIS OFFICIAL

08:32.980 --> 08:34.715
AT A 5:00 P.M.
NEWS CONFERENCE TOMORROW.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.016
NOTICE ANYTHING?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.019
HE'S KEEPING
MAJOR CRIMES!

08:39.052 --> 08:41.622
YES, THAT.
YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.991
BUT LOOK HERE --
I AM NOW CAPTAIN

08:44.024 --> 08:45.926
OF TRAFFIC,
VALLEY BUREAU.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.062
OH, WILL, I'M SO SORRY.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.764
THAT'S JUST TERRIBLE.

08:50.798 --> 08:51.999
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.667
I WON'T ACCEPT THE JOB,
OF COURSE,

08:53.701 --> 08:55.302
BUT I STILL HAVE TO BE
OUT OF MY OFFICE TOMORROW,

08:55.335 --> 08:57.838
AFTER WHICH YOU WILL BE
DIRECTING ALL OF YOUR INQUIRIES

08:57.871 --> 08:59.840
TO NEW ASSISTANT CHIEF
RUSSELL TAYLOR.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.710
OH.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.112
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT MAY BE GETTING WORSE.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.714
I JUST FOUND OUT
THERE ARE --

09:06.747 --> 09:09.316
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHIEF.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.918
Delk:
CHIEF JOHNSON, CHIEF POPE,

09:10.951 --> 09:12.886
MAY WE SPEAK PRIVATELY,
PLEASE?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.588
I-I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF --

09:14.622 --> 09:15.923
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,
ALL RIGHT.

09:15.956 --> 09:16.957
LET'S GO.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.648
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
CHIEF?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.717
PIZZA --
SOMEONE ORDERED IT.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.119
WE HAD VODKA BOTTLES,
JOINTS IN THE ASHTRAYS,

09:46.153 --> 09:47.254
AND HALF-NAKED GIRLS,

09:47.287 --> 09:48.656
BUT WHERE WAS THE PIZZA?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.972
Delk:
CHIEF JOHNSON, LAST SUMMER,

10:05.005 --> 10:06.707
DID MAJOR CRIMES
INVESTIGATE THE MURDERS

10:06.740 --> 10:09.009
OF AN ELDERLY
CONVENIENCE-STORE OWNER

10:09.042 --> 10:10.744
AND HIS 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON,

10:10.778 --> 10:13.346
REFERRED TO AS
THE "SHOOTIN' NEWTON" MURDERS?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.148
IN THE COURSE
OF CLOSING A CASE

10:15.182 --> 10:17.751
IN WHICH THREE ARMY RANGERS
WERE SHOT TO DEATH,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.787
YES, WE DEALT
WITH SHOOTIN' NEWTON. WHY?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.855
AND DID YOU OBTAIN
A CONFESSION FROM THE SUSPECT

10:21.889 --> 10:26.059
TURELL BAYLOR THAT
YOU COULD NOT USE IN COURT?

10:26.093 --> 10:28.662
I ASKED THE D.A.
TO GIVE TURELL IMMUNITY,

10:28.696 --> 10:31.799
SO, YES,
HIS CONFESSION WAS USELESS.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.100
AND DID YOU THEN
ESCORT TURELL,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.968
A BLACK GANG MEMBER,
BACK TO HIS HOUSE,

10:35.002 --> 10:36.704
AFTER WHICH
HE WAS BEATEN TO DEATH?
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

10:36.737 --> 10:40.373
TURELL'S MOTHER HAS FILED
A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE CITY,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.676
THE L.A.P.D., CHIEF POPE,
YOURSELF,

10:42.710 --> 10:44.044
AND EVERY MEMBER
OF YOUR DIVISION

10:44.077 --> 10:45.813
FOR THE WRONGFUL DEATH
OF TURELL BAYLOR.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.314
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.883
ONE OF THE MORE SERIOUS
ACCUSATIONS IN HER SUIT

10:49.917 --> 10:52.720
IS THAT YOU DROVE
MR. BAYLOR HOME

10:52.753 --> 10:55.388
KNOWING THAT
HE COULD BE EXECUTED

10:55.422 --> 10:57.290
BY HIS OWN GANG MEMBERS,

10:57.324 --> 10:58.959
THUS DEPRIVING HIM
OF DUE PROCESS.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.427
THIS IS
A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.262
THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
GETS ONE

11:02.295 --> 11:03.764
EVERY TIME
WE SHOOT SOMEONE.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.132
ADD IT TO THE PILE.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.334
Delk: OTHER FILINGS OF THIS SORT
ARE ONE PAGE.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.468
THIS ONE IS OVER 40.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.303
Raydor: CHIEF JOHNSON,
DID YOU KNOW

11:10.337 --> 11:12.472
THAT MR. BAYLOR
WOULD BE MURDERED

11:12.505 --> 11:15.142
AFTER YOU DROPPED HIM OFF
AT HIS HOUSE?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.378
I'M NOT A FORTUNE TELLER.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.980
HE ASKED ME TO TAKE HIM HOME.
I TOOK HIM THERE.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.722
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.228
WELL, THEN,
A TRANSPARENCY AUDIT

11:35.262 --> 11:37.030
OF THE SHOOTIN' NEWTON
MURDERS

11:37.064 --> 11:38.298
SHOULD MAKE THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.067
AN AUDIT
COMES EXTREMELY CLOSE

11:40.100 --> 11:42.202
TO QUESTIONING
MY PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.004
AND THIS LAWSUIT
COMES EXTREMELY CLOSE

11:44.037 --> 11:46.206
TO QUESTIONING THE CONDUCT
OF OUR WHOLE DEPARTMENT.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.942
SO, WHILE WE'RE FIGHTING TO GET
THESE CHARGES DISMISSED,

11:48.976 --> 11:50.878
YOU WILL FULLY COOPERATE
WITH CAPTAIN RAYDOR

11:50.911 --> 11:53.013
AND REFRAIN FROM DISCUSSING

11:53.046 --> 11:54.848
EITHER THE SUBJECT
OF THIS ARTICLE

11:54.882 --> 11:56.383
OR THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE
COMPLAINT WITH OTHER DEFENDANTS.

11:56.416 --> 12:00.120
HOW ABOUT I JUST QUIT?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.259
THEN I'LL TIE THIS LAWSUIT
AROUND YOUR NECK

12:06.293 --> 12:08.028
AND TELL THE CITY ATTORNEY

12:08.061 --> 12:09.997
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO TURELL BAYLOR
WAS A CONSEQUENCE

12:10.030 --> 12:12.299
OF YOUR OWN
PERSONAL ACTIONS.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.103
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
GO AHEAD.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.304
QUIT.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.152
I'M DOING WHAT'S BEST
FOR EVERYONE HERE.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.321
TRY TO BE HELPFUL,
CHIEF JOHNSON,

12:34.354 --> 12:37.257
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.169
SO, UM...

12:49.202 --> 12:51.571
CHIEF JOHNSON, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I DID NOT

12:51.604 --> 12:56.176
INSTIGATE THIS INVESTIGATION
INTO YOUR CONDUCT.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.878
I AM HERE ON ASSIGNMENT,
AND MY MISSION --

12:57.911 --> 12:59.446
SO MUCH FOR US
BEING FRIENDS.

12:59.479 --> 13:04.217
ASK FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED
FROM LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.593
OH, CHIEF, CHIEF,
YOU OKAY?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.062
UH, WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

13:15.095 --> 13:17.865
REORGANIZATION STUFF --
NOTHING SERIOUS.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.499
LET'S NOT
THINK ABOUT IT NOW.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.269
SO, UM, THE PIZZA THAT WAS
ORDERED BY OUR VICTIMS?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.104
Tao: THE DELIVERY GUY,
MARCUS JACKSON,

13:24.137 --> 13:25.873
JUST TURNED 18,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.375
BUT HIS JUVIE RAP SHOWS
TWO ROBBERIES AND AN ASSAULT.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.911
YEAH, HE'S A MEMBER
OF THE 5-0 BLOODS,

13:30.944 --> 13:32.279
AND HE'S MISSING.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.115
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH HIS BOSS AT BIG PIE,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.984
AND HE SAYS MARCUS TOOK OFF
ON A DELIVERY

13:37.017 --> 13:39.019
LAST NIGHT ABOUT 1:30 A.M.
AND NEVER GOT BACK.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.153
I PUT A WANT OUT ON HIM.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.454
WE'VE GOT, UH,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.623
FLYNN AND GABRIEL LOOKING
FOR HIM NOW.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.625
OKAY. AND THE OWNER

13:45.658 --> 13:48.328
OF THE RECORD COMPANY,
SHANKED,

13:48.361 --> 13:49.229
ANTWONE...?

13:49.262 --> 13:50.630
Tao: DECKER.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.133
WE GOT CALLS OUT
TO HIS PEOPLE.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.567
WAITING TO HEAR BACK.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.537
BUT LOOK WHAT I FOUND
ON C-GAME'S PHONE.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.906
WHO'S SHE?

13:58.939 --> 14:01.274
HIS GIRLFRIEND,
KEISHA MURPHY.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.442
AND SHE WAS AT THE HOUSE
WITH HIM

14:02.475 --> 14:03.977
FIVE HOURS
BEFORE THE MURDERS.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.345
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND?

14:05.378 --> 14:08.081
I CHECKED THE TEXTS
BETWEEN KEISHA AND C-GAME.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.550
OH, MY.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.419
THEY CERTAINLY WERE FRIENDLY,
WEREN'T THEY?

14:12.452 --> 14:15.055
IT'S CALLED SEXTING,
CHIEF.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.957
LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE SEND
NAKED PICTURES OF THEMSELVES

14:16.990 --> 14:19.059
TO, YOU KNOW,
CEMENT THEIR RELATIONSHIP --
UH, YEAH, YEAH, UH,

14:19.092 --> 14:21.194
THIS KEISHA --
NOT AT HOME,

14:21.228 --> 14:23.063
AND SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP
FOR WORK THIS MORNING.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.597
WELL, UM,
I NEED TO TALK TO KEISHA.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.099
SHE MAY BE THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE OUR VICTIMS ALIVE.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.434
CHECK IT OUT, CHIEF.

14:27.467 --> 14:31.604
I BOUGHT THIS INSULATED
TAKE-OUT BAG...

14:31.638 --> 14:33.640
OFF A PIZZA-DELIVERY GUY
DOWNSTAIRS.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.611
Tao: FOAM -- SAME STUFF WE FOUND
AT THE SCENE.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.213
IF OUR KILLER SHOT THROUGH A BAG
LIKE THIS,

14:40.247 --> 14:41.614
IT WOULD MUFFLE THE NOISE.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.150
IT ALSO EXPLAINS
WHY THERE WERE NO CASINGS.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.651
MAYBE IT WAS A PLANNED HIT.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.020
ON WHOM

14:47.054 --> 14:48.555
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESS
IS SUGGESTING.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.157
PLUS,
ALL THIS MEDIA ATTENTION

14:50.190 --> 14:51.391
HAS MADE
THIS KID'S SINGLE

14:51.424 --> 14:53.927
THE NUMBER-ONE-DOWNLOADED
SONG ONLINE.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.362
THE VIDEO'S EVERYWHERE.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.531
WELL, ONE WAY TO GET TO THE TOP
OF THE CHARTS.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.700
TOO BAD THE KID WON'T BE AROUND
TO ENJOY IT.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.269
Tao:
HIS RECORD LABEL WILL.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.337
ANTWONE DECKER'S
GONNA RAKE IT IN.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.505
* DO YOUR OWN THING

15:05.538 --> 15:06.706
* I'M THE NEW MAN

15:06.739 --> 15:08.008
* YOU'RE A HAS-BEEN

15:08.041 --> 15:09.309
* WE DOIN' SHOPPING SPREES

15:09.342 --> 15:10.944
* I BOUGHT HER NEW CLOTHES

15:10.978 --> 15:13.380
* I LOVE STARING
AT HER PRETTY LITTLE ROSE *

15:13.413 --> 15:15.983
* WE SO FLY,
WE CHILLIN' IN THE LEAR *

15:16.016 --> 15:19.019
* AND I NEVER KNEW HOW SMALL
YOU WERE FROM UP HERE *

15:23.723 --> 15:25.025
FRITZI,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.260
JUST SAYING...HI.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.661
UH-HUH.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.531
AND, UH, WONDERING,

15:31.564 --> 15:33.200
AS FBI LIAISON,

15:33.233 --> 15:36.203
WHY THE L.A.P.D. WANTS TO TALK
TO ANTWONE DECKER.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.471
WHO SAYS WE DO?
BRENDA...

15:38.505 --> 15:41.408
HE'S THE PRINCIPAL
PERSON OF INTEREST

15:41.441 --> 15:43.743
IN A JOINT FBI-L.A.P.D.
INVESTIGATION.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.378
WE HAVE WIRES
SET UP ALL AROUND HIM.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.480
WE HEARD SANCHEZ CALL
HIS OFFICE THIS MORNING.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.648
ARE YOU GOING
TO LET ME IN?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.051
OH, ALL RIGHT.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.452
IF -- IF YOU MUST KNOW,

15:52.485 --> 15:55.055
WE'VE GOT QUESTIONS
FOR ANTWONE DECKER

15:55.088 --> 15:56.489
ABOUT SEVEN MURDERS,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.425
INCLUDING A RAPPER
HE WAS REPRESENTING.
C

15:58.458 --> 16:01.995
UM, EXCUSE ME.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.065
CHIEF, I'M GONNA DUCK OUT,
TALK TO THE PRESS.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.135
IF YOU COULD TRY TO KEEP AHEAD
OF THIS STORY,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.402
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.406
SO, UH...

16:13.440 --> 16:14.474
CARRY ON.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.348
DID HE JUST TELL US
TO "CARRY ON"?

16:21.381 --> 16:23.216
LIEUTENANT, LET'S NOT THINK
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.285
WELL, WHAT KIND OF BULL--

16:25.318 --> 16:26.753
I SAID LET'S NOT THINK
ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT!

16:26.786 --> 16:29.256
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS CASE?

16:29.289 --> 16:31.258
I KNOW C-GAME'S BROTHER,
KEVIN,

16:31.291 --> 16:33.393
DISTRIBUTED COKE
FOR ANTWONE DECKER.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.028
Tao: COKE!

16:35.062 --> 16:37.497
MIGHT EXPLAIN WHERE ALL
THE MONEY WE FOUND --

16:37.530 --> 16:39.266
OH.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.700
MONEY

16:40.733 --> 16:42.402
WAIT --
YOU FOUND MONEY?

16:49.409 --> 16:50.710
BRENDA.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.312
YEAH.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.646
THE FBI AND THE L.A.P.D.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.815
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING DECKER
FOR YEARS.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.817
IF WE CAN TIE DRUG MONEY
TO HIM --

16:57.850 --> 16:59.152
MONEY LAUNDERING?

16:59.186 --> 17:00.787
I SAW SEVEN DEAD KIDS
THIS MORNING.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.422
IF DECKER'S INVOLVED,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.757
HE SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR MURDER,
NOT MONEY LAUNDERING.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.393
DECKER'S NEVER GONNA
TALK TO YOU.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.261
EVEN IF HE IS INVOLVED,
YOU'RE GONNA FIND 100 PEOPLE

17:08.295 --> 17:09.629
BETWEEN HIM
AND THE ACTUAL SHOOTER.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.064
NO, HE HAS A RECORD.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.165
HE'S BEEN CAUGHT
IN THE ACT BEFORE.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.300
BECAUSE HE DOES
STUPID THINGS

17:13.333 --> 17:15.068
WHEN HE GETS ANGRY
AND PARANOID.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.769
BUT HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO GET HIM UPSET.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.138
TRUST ME.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.606
YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT HIM --

17:19.639 --> 17:21.308
MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME
WHAT MOTIVE HE MIGHT HAVE HAD

17:21.341 --> 17:22.775
FOR KNOCKING OFF C-GAME
AND HIS BROTHER.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.677
WELL, C-GAME'S DEAL WITH SHANKED
WAS PRETTY BAD.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.180
KEVIN WAS SHOPPING HIS BROTHER
TO ANOTHER LABEL.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.581
DID DECKER
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

17:28.615 --> 17:31.818
I'M TOLD
THAT THE TASK FORCE

17:31.851 --> 17:34.121
MAY HAVE LEAKED THE INFORMATION
TO DECKER

17:34.154 --> 17:36.089
IN SUCH A WAY
THAT HE FOUND OUT, YEAH.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.358
YOU GUYS MADE KEVIN BROOKS
A TARGET?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.360
HEY, HEY, FIRST OF ALL,
THERE'S NO "YOU GUYS," OKAY?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.363
THIS IS A JOINT TASK
FORCE BETWEEN THE
L.A.P.D. AND THE FBI.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.365
I'M JUST THE MESSENGER.
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS --

17:45.398 --> 17:47.134
THE FACT OF THE MATTER
IS THAT SEVEN PEOPLE

17:47.167 --> 17:48.368
MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED

17:48.401 --> 17:50.670
BECAUSE KEVIN BROOKS
WAS USED AS BAIT!

17:50.703 --> 17:53.140
LOOK --
I NEED TO KNOW WHO ELSE

17:53.173 --> 17:54.274
YOUR TASK FORCE
MIGHT HAVE PUT IN DANGER...

17:54.307 --> 17:56.143
JOINT TASK FORCE.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.644
...STARTING WITH THE PERSON
WHO TOLD DECKER

17:57.677 --> 17:59.379
WHAT KEVIN BROOKS
WAS DOING -- PLEASE.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.613
ALL RIGHT, I'LL FIND THAT OUT,
BUT I'M TELLING YOU --

18:00.647 --> 18:02.315
DECKER IS UNTOUCHABLE.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.716
NOTHING WE DO IS GONNA PUT HIM
IN YOUR INTERVIEW ROOM.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.185
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.387
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.688
ANTWONE DECKER
WON'T TALK TO US,

18:08.721 --> 18:10.890
BUT HIS ATTORNEY IS HERE
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.325
THANK YOU.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.563
CHIEF, CHIEF,
CAPTAIN RAYDOR IS ASKING ME

18:16.596 --> 18:19.232
FOR THE MURDER BOOK
ON OUR SHOOTIN' NEWTON --

18:19.266 --> 18:21.534
JUST ASSIST HER
WITH WHATEVER SHE NEEDS.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.370
ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.372
YES, IT'S ABOUT
TO MAKE ME CRAZY.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.639
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.141
JUST HELP HER, PLEASE.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.143
OHH, THAT WOMAN!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.382
OKAY, GREAT.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.683
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU SOON.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.521
MR. BRADDOCK,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

18:41.554 --> 18:44.591
SOMEONE FROM THE L.A.P.D.
CALLED MY CLIENT'S OFFICE --

18:44.624 --> 18:45.825
ANTWONE DECKER --

18:45.858 --> 18:46.926
AND SAID THERE WAS
A CHIEF JOHNSON HERE

18:46.959 --> 18:47.860
WHO WANTED TO
SPEAK WITH HIM.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.429
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.530
MM.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.199
WHERE'S MR. DECKER?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.666
BUSY.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.568
MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.504
SEVERAL YOUNG PEOPLE
FOUND MURDERED

18:57.537 --> 18:59.339
IN A HOUSE
OWNED BY YOUR CLIENT.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.474
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO WAS IN THE HOUSE?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.310
VICTIMS ONE THROUGH SEVEN.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.378
I SEE.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.281
WE ALSO REMOVED THIS
VERY HEAVY ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE

19:08.315 --> 19:09.549
FROM THE HOUSE.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.950
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

19:10.983 --> 19:14.287
IF THE MURDERS HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ITS CONTENTS.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.488
LET ME SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.923
I'LL GIVE YOU
MY BEST GUESS.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.860
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,

19:20.893 --> 19:23.730
MY OPENING THIS CASE
WITHOUT YOUR CLIENT PRESENT.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.864
SORRY.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.468
CHIEF JOHNSON.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.438
PLEASURE MEETING YOU,
MR. BRADDOCK.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.308
OH, SHOOT.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.976
YES, LIEUTENANT?

19:37.009 --> 19:40.780
WELL, WE FOUND OUR PIZZA GUY,
MARCUS JACKSON,

19:40.813 --> 19:42.215
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S OUR SHOOTER.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.450
WHY NOT?

19:43.483 --> 19:45.352
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
HE'S GOT NO SHIRT,

19:45.385 --> 19:46.386
NO PIZZA BAG...

19:46.419 --> 19:48.921
AND NO PULSE.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.266
Brenda:
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR,

19:59.299 --> 20:01.434
THIS INVESTIGATION
INTO MY CONDUCT,

20:01.468 --> 20:03.870
ESPECIALLY SINCE
I DIDN'T BREAK ANY LAWS.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.505
MAYBE IT'LL BLOW OVER.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.474
YOU KNOW, YOU GET HIT WITH
THESE LAWSUITS ALL THE TIME.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.709
NO, NO, THIS ONE'S SERIOUS.
I'VE SEEN IT.

20:09.742 --> 20:13.646
OH, RAYDOR'S POKING AROUND
THOSE SHOOTIN' NEWTON MURDERS,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.616
GOING OVER EVERY SQUARE INCH
OF MY WORK,

20:16.649 --> 20:18.985
LOOKING FOR IMPRO--

20:19.018 --> 20:20.353
IMPRO-- IMP--

20:20.387 --> 20:21.454
IMPROPRIETY?

20:21.488 --> 20:22.755
IMPROPRIETIES.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.424
SHOOT.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.425
AND I --

20:25.458 --> 20:27.294
OH, I'M SORRY.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.761
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE READING.

20:28.795 --> 20:29.996
IT'S OKAY.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.739
AND TURELL BAYLOR'S
A MURDERER.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.773
HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE --

20:40.807 --> 20:42.442
TWO!

20:42.475 --> 20:44.311
AND I'M BEING SUED.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.978
ISN'T POPE PROTECTING YOU?

20:46.012 --> 20:48.047
HE CAN'T EVEN
PROTECT HIMSELF.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.316
HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.584
STOP.
DON'T BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.586
TAYLOR TAKING HIS PLACE.
UGH!

20:53.620 --> 20:55.455
I DON'T THINK
I COULD STAND IT.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.757
GOD, IF I COULD JUST QUIT.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.594
HERE I AM, UNDER THE GUN

21:01.628 --> 21:03.896
FOR SUPPOSEDLY SETTING UP...

21:03.930 --> 21:05.765
TURELL BAYLOR TO BE MURDERED

21:05.798 --> 21:08.368
WHILE YOU PEOPLE DID THE SAME
THING TO KEVIN BROOKS.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.669
NOT "YOU PEOPLE."

21:09.702 --> 21:11.671
IT'S FBI AND L.A.P.D. --

21:11.704 --> 21:13.540
JOINT TASK FORCE.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.074
THEY KNEW KEVIN BROOKS WAS
SHOPPING HIS BROTHER AROUND

21:15.107 --> 21:16.909
BEHIND
ANTWONE DECKER'S BACK.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.311
THEY SET THAT BOY UP

21:18.345 --> 21:20.347
JUST TO SEE
WHAT THIS DANGEROUS,

21:20.380 --> 21:22.048
PSYCHOTIC GANGSTER
WOULD DO.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.451
NOW SEVEN PEOPLE
ARE DEAD.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.985
AND THE PIZZA BOY.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.420
EIGHT -- EIGHT PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.323
IF DECKER'S
REALLY RESPONSIBLE,

21:30.357 --> 21:32.091
WHY DID HE KILL ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE,

21:32.124 --> 21:33.726
INCLUDING THE GUY
SELLING COKE FOR HIM,

21:33.760 --> 21:34.994
AND THEN LEAVE
THE MONEY BEHIND?

21:35.027 --> 21:36.863
I DON'T KNOW.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.031
NOW THAT YOU PULLED THAT STUNT
WITH HIS LAWYER,

21:39.065 --> 21:42.569
DECKER'S GONNA WANT
HIS $750,000 BACK.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.872
WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE IT?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.340
THE MONEY, I MEAN.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.775
BUT YOU DO HAVE IT.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.009
WHAT IF I DIDN'T?

21:50.042 --> 21:52.545
YOU THINK ANTWONE DECKER
WOULD GO NUTS?

21:52.579 --> 21:53.913
BRENDA, IF HE DOES,

21:53.946 --> 21:55.815
YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.386
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE MORNING.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.690
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SLEEP
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.659
IT'S SO INFURIATING
TO WORK SO HARD

22:06.693 --> 22:09.796
FOR SO LONG WITH SO LITTLE
APPRECIATION FOR PEOPLE.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.500
WHAT'S THAT?

22:13.533 --> 22:14.834
YOU WANTED TO KNOW

22:14.867 --> 22:17.136
WHO MIGHT HAVE TOLD DECKER
THAT KEVIN BROOKS

22:17.169 --> 22:19.639
WAS SHOPPING HIS BROTHER
TO ANOTHER RECORD LABEL.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.007
IT'S A LIST.

22:25.545 --> 22:28.781
OH!

22:28.815 --> 22:30.550
SEE?
I APPRECIATE YOU.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.419
YES, YOU DO.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.821
AND I'M NAKED.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.956
* 'CAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A KING, HOMEBOY, BOW DOWN *

22:36.989 --> 22:38.925
* I HOPE YOU KNOW NOW
I'M THE MAN ON THIS BLOCK *

22:38.958 --> 22:40.159
YES, YOU ARE.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.728
* I AIN'T GOT TIME TO KILL

22:41.761 --> 22:43.162
* I'M FOR REAL
WITH THE GLOCK, RAH *

22:43.195 --> 22:44.897
* LOOK AT ME NOW,
SHE'S ROLLIN' WITH A "G" *

22:44.931 --> 22:47.667
* SHE USED TO BE YOURS,
NOW SHE ROLLIN' WITH ME *

22:47.700 --> 22:48.668
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

22:48.701 --> 22:49.969
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

22:50.002 --> 22:52.739
* SHE'S WITH ME TONIGHT

22:52.772 --> 22:53.873
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.107
AH, CHIEF.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.809
NOW, WHO PROFITS FROM --

22:56.843 --> 22:58.811
SANCHEZ, TURN THAT DOWN!

22:58.845 --> 23:00.547
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT *

23:00.580 --> 23:02.048
* SHE'S WITH ME -- *

23:02.081 --> 23:04.383
OH, SORRY, SIR.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.021
CHIEF, WHO PROFITS
FROM THE INCREASED ALBUM SALES

23:09.055 --> 23:11.057
AFTER C

23:11.090 --> 23:12.091
ANTWONE DECKER.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.626
WHO OWNS THE HOUSE

23:13.660 --> 23:14.961
WHERE OUR VICTIMS
WERE MURDERED?

23:14.994 --> 23:16.028
ANTWONE DECKER.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.864
NOW, TAKE A GUESS

23:17.897 --> 23:21.934
AS TO WHO IS WAITING RIGHT NOW
FOR YOU IN INTERVIEW ROOM 2.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.570
ANTWONE DECKER.
UH-HUH.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.103
HE MUST REALLY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN THAT BRIEFCASE.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.538
AHA!

23:25.572 --> 23:27.940
ARRANGED, AS REQUESTED.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.609
DECKER'S NOT HERE
TO CONFESS.

23:29.642 --> 23:30.877
WE'LL SEE.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.612
UH, LIEUTENANT,
IS EVERYBODY READY?

23:32.645 --> 23:34.146
UH, TAO IS PLACING
THE TRACKING DEVICE

23:34.180 --> 23:36.015
ON DECKER'S CAR
AS WE SPEAK --

23:36.048 --> 23:37.950
AS LONG AS WE HAVE ACCESS
TO THE WIRES.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.519
YES.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.120
VERY WELL.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.189
UH, AND CHRIS BROOKS'
GIRLFRIEND --

23:43.222 --> 23:44.591
HAVE WE FOUND HER YET?

23:44.624 --> 23:45.658
UH, KEISHA MURPHY?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.193
NO, NOT YET, CHIEF,

23:47.226 --> 23:49.662
BUT I HAVE AN S.I.S. UNIT
SITTING IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE,

23:49.696 --> 23:52.164
SO, YOU KNOW, THE MOMENT
SHE COMES HOME, WE'LL...

23:54.000 --> 23:55.134
DAVID?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.938
WHAT IS IT?

23:58.971 --> 24:02.241
JUST -- I PROMISED
MR. BROOKS

24:02.274 --> 24:04.744
THAT EVERYONE WOULD KNOW
THAT HIS BOYS WERE NOT CRIPS,

24:04.777 --> 24:05.945
THAT THEY WERE NOT GANG,

24:05.978 --> 24:07.614
AND THAT WE WOULD ARREST
THE KILLER,

24:07.647 --> 24:09.482
BUT IF DECKER DOESN'T ADMIT
TO IT, THEN I DON'T --

24:09.516 --> 24:10.883
WE HAVE A PLAN, DAVID.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.485
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS

24:12.519 --> 24:14.954
BEFORE WE START
MAKING EXCUSES, OKAY?

24:14.987 --> 24:17.624
LIEUTENANT,
HERE ARE THE NAMES

24:17.657 --> 24:20.527
OF EVERYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE
INFORMED ANTWONE DECKER

24:20.560 --> 24:22.529
THAT KEVIN BROOKS
WAS SHOPPING C-GAME

24:22.562 --> 24:24.030
TO OTHER RECORD PRODUCERS.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.198
LOOK AT THIS --
KEISHA MURPHY.
Brenda: I KNOW.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.735
SHE'S EVERYWHERE BUT HERE,
AND I REALLY NEED TO FIND HER.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.202
LET'S SEE WHAT ANTWONE DECKER
HAS TO SAY.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.505
UH, LIEUTENANT,
WASN'T THERE SOMETHING

24:32.539 --> 24:34.941
THAT YOU WANTED
TO TELL THE CHIEF?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.810
OH, R-RIGHT, RIGHT.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.979
AH, CHIEF,
IT'S A GOOD THING

24:40.012 --> 24:43.115
THAT CAPTAIN RAYDOR
IS DOING...

24:43.149 --> 24:45.852
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS
SHE'S DOING HERE.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.687
UM, OTHERWISE,
I MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN

24:47.720 --> 24:50.156
TO TELL YOU THAT TAYLOR
WANTS TO BE INFORMED

24:50.189 --> 24:51.624
BEFORE YOU
INTERVIEW ANYBODY,

24:51.658 --> 24:54.894
UH, SO HE CAN OBSERVE.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.163
LIEUTENANT,
I'M STARTING MY INTERVIEW

24:57.196 --> 24:58.565
WITH ANTWONE DECKER.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.600
PLEASE LET
THE COMMANDER KNOW.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.068
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YES, MA'AM.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.737
UH, CHIEF, THE COMMANDER
ALSO WOULD LIKE YOU

25:04.771 --> 25:06.739
TO WEAR, UH, AN EARWIG

25:06.773 --> 25:08.541
SO THAT HE CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH YOU DURING THE --

25:08.575 --> 25:09.876
I'D LOVE TO COMMUNICATE

25:09.909 --> 25:11.277
WITH THE COMMANDER, TOO,

25:11.310 --> 25:13.279
AND AS SOON AS I FIND
THE RIGHT WORDS, I WILL.

25:13.312 --> 25:14.881
EXCUSE ME.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.518
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK.
MR. BRADDOCK.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.955
MR. DECKER, I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.257
I WONDER IF I MIGHT HAVE
A MOMENT WITH YOU ALONE.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.026
WHAT IS THIS?

25:27.059 --> 25:30.897
MY CLIENT AGREED TO COME HERE
FOR ONE REASON.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.632
NOW, HE HAS THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.133
AND I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO WALK OUT OF HERE

25:34.166 --> 25:35.768
WITH THIS BRIEFCASE
AND NOT COME BACK.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.169
SO, MR. DECKER,
I SUGGEST THAT YOU REVOKE

25:37.203 --> 25:40.773
AND ASK MR. BRADDOCK
TO STEP OUT OF THE ROOM.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.714
YO, "B,"
GIVE US A SECOND, MAN.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.087
THANK YOU.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.826
THIS MUST BE A DIFFICULT TIME
FOR YOU.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.596
YEAH, YOU KNOW, TRAGIC.

26:03.630 --> 26:07.266
I UNDERSTAND THAT CHRIS BROOKS
WAS A TALENTED YOUNG MAN.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.736
ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
DONE THIS TO HIM?

26:09.769 --> 26:12.304
KID WAS A HUSTLER.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.773
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
WHAT HE WANTED,

26:13.806 --> 26:15.642
YOU WEREN'T MUCH GOOD
TO HIM.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.744
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT
WHERE I'M FROM.

26:17.777 --> 26:18.845
IT AIN'T LOYAL.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.947
NO, IT'S NOT.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.684
I-IS THAT WHY YOU HAD SECURITY
WATCHING HIM AT YOUR HOUSE --

26:24.717 --> 26:26.052
BECAUSE HE WAS DISLOYAL?

26:26.085 --> 26:28.354
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A SCARY WORLD.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.690
YOU GOT TO TAKE
PRECAUTIONS.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.358
TURNS OUT I WAS RIGHT.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.160
THE KID HAD PROBLEMS.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.729
PROBLEMS WITH GANGS
OR PROBLEMS WITH DRUGS?

26:36.763 --> 26:38.631
YOU'RE THE COP.
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.167
SO...

26:41.200 --> 26:42.735
ARE YOU GONNA SHOW ME WHAT'S
IN THAT DAMN CASE OR WHAT?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.937
OH, YES, ABSOLUTELY.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.140
OH, MY.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.776
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS CASE

26:49.809 --> 26:51.610
USED TO BE FILLED
WITH LOTS OF MONEY.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.146
I-I'M GUESSING THAT CASH
BELONGED TO YOU?

26:57.183 --> 27:00.720
Taylor:
LIEUTENANT, I TOLD YOU

27:00.753 --> 27:03.022
I WANTED TO OBSERVE
CHIEF JOHNSON'S INTERVIEWS.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.658
WELL, THE SUSPECT SAID
HE WOULDN'T WAIT FOR YOU.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.293
CHIEF DELK, PLEASE.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.295
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.968
CHIEF JOHNSON, I NEED TO --

27:17.036 --> 27:21.007
BUZZ, I TOLD YOU I WANTED HER
TO HAVE AN EARWIG.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.174
I...

27:24.443 --> 27:26.012
I FORGOT
TO GIVE IT TO HER.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.750
ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
TAKEN THAT CASH?

27:30.783 --> 27:34.921
OH, MR. DECKER,
DON'T GO AWAY MAD.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.965
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
IN THERE?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.734
WE MAY BE VERY CLOSE
TO ARRESTING MR. DECKER

27:47.767 --> 27:48.835
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.002
ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF WHOM?

27:50.036 --> 27:52.304
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
EXCUSE ME.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.248
I GOT HIM. LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOING WEST ON OLYMPIC.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.016
BRENDA:
Don't stay any closer to Decker
than you need to, please.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.451
Be careful, gentlemen.

28:05.484 --> 28:06.886
He gets mean
when he's angry.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.154
COPY THAT.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.790
PROVENZA,
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

28:10.823 --> 28:13.793
JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW
POLICY, OKAY?

28:13.826 --> 28:15.127
DECKER'S MAKING A CALL.

28:15.161 --> 28:18.898
OKAY, WAIT.
I'LL PATCH IT IN.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.800
GIZ: What's up, Antwone?
What you want?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.935
I need to get that bitch
Keisha Murphy.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.503
Keisha Murphy?
What'd she do?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.072
She took my money,

28:26.105 --> 28:27.239
then ran straight back
to that DeAndre kid.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.474
DeAndre?

28:28.507 --> 28:29.842
I thought she broke up
with that fool.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.143
HE'S TURNING NORTH
ON WESTERN.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.979
FLYNN: Yeah, copy that.
We're one block back.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.781
GIZ: Where he at?

28:34.814 --> 28:35.915
DECKER: Hey, you know his spot.
He living with his moms.

28:35.948 --> 28:39.285
Got it --
1674 South Mansfield.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.153
Bring Tops and Bumper
with you.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.822
I can't trust no one but us
on this, a'ight?

28:42.855 --> 28:44.156
I'm on my way.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.892
WELL, HE HUNG UP.
THAT'S IT.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.827
1674 South Mansfield.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.161
Looks like you guys
are in business.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.429
COPY THAT.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.799
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:52.832 --> 28:54.066
MAYBE HAND ME
ONE OF THOSE, OKAY?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.072
WE'RE BACK
IN C-STREET TERRITORY,

29:00.106 --> 29:01.240
ONE BLOCK
FROM CHRIS' HOUSE.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.474
DAMN IT.

29:02.508 --> 29:03.876
THOSE BOYS TURN OUT
TO BE CRIPS...

29:05.978 --> 29:07.246
THAT'S DECKER'S CAR
OVER THERE.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.781
HE GOT HERE
ABOUT A MINUTE AGO.

29:08.815 --> 29:12.051
HE WENT IN THAT HOUSE
WITH HIS FRIENDS.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.987
OKAY, THE HOUSE BELONGS
TO A FLORENCE HARMON.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.824
SHE'S GOT A 22-YEAR-OLD SON,
DeANDRE HARMON.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.025
FLYNN:
Yeah, copy that, Chief.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.163
LET'S GO! GO! GO! GO!

29:24.196 --> 29:26.132
SHOTS FIRED!
OFFICER NEEDS HELP!

29:26.165 --> 29:28.567
POLICE! POLICE!
FREEZE! DAMN IT!

29:28.600 --> 29:29.969
I SAID FREEZE, DAMN IT!

29:30.002 --> 29:31.303
DROP THOSE WEAPONS!

29:31.337 --> 29:33.072
FREEZE, OR I'LL SHOOT!

29:33.105 --> 29:34.406
PUT YOUR HANDS UP
IN THE AIR!

29:34.440 --> 29:35.407
DROP THEM AND SLIDE THEM
OVER HERE RIGHT NOW!

29:39.378 --> 29:43.215
YOU TELL ME WHERE MY MONEY IS
RIGHT NOW!
LET HER GO!

29:43.249 --> 29:44.350
DROP THE GUN!

29:44.383 --> 29:45.517
NO WAY!

29:46.886 --> 29:48.187
I'M GONNA COUNT TO THREE!
ONE...

29:50.022 --> 29:51.824
DO IT NOW!
YOU WANT TO DIE, BITCH?!

29:51.858 --> 29:53.059
AAH!
GET ON THE GROUND!

29:53.092 --> 29:54.093
GET ON THE GROUND!

29:54.126 --> 29:55.127
...TWO...

29:59.198 --> 30:01.167
Tao: DEEP BREATHS.
TAKE DEEP BREATHS.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.169
YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.272
YOU OKAY

30:06.305 --> 30:07.539
OKAY.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.075
CHIEF, WE'RE GOOD.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.010
WE'RE GOOD,
AND WE FOUND KEISHA MURPHY.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.945
We got her, Chief.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.381
YOU'RE OKAY NOW.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.526
YOU LED YOUR PRIME SUSPECT
IN EIGHT MURDERS

30:27.559 --> 30:29.495
TO BELIEVE MONEY
HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM

30:29.528 --> 30:32.131
JUST TO SEE
WHO HE WOULD TRY TO KILL?

30:32.164 --> 30:34.233
I NEEDED TO KNOW WHO HE THOUGHT
STOLE HIS CASH.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.002
THE FACT THAT WE CAUGHT HIM

30:36.035 --> 30:39.405
IN THE ACT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER
IS JUST A HUGE BONUS.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.973
CHIEF JOHNSON,
SHOTS WERE FIRED.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.942
THE GIRL'S
BEEN BADLY BEATEN.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.543
NOT TO MENTION WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG MAN
WHO TRIED TO DEFEND HER.

30:44.576 --> 30:47.313
OH, MY GOD, HER FACE.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.381
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO WATC HER.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.350
CHIEF, IF WE'RE TO BE
HELD ACCOUNTABLE

30:51.383 --> 30:53.485
FOR WHAT SUSPECTS DO
AFTER WE QUESTION THEM,

30:53.519 --> 30:56.322
WE MIGHT AS WELL TURN IN
OUR BADGES AND GO HOME.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.090
Raydor:
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE, CHIEF,

30:58.124 --> 31:00.326
BECAUSE WHATEVER
OUR "BUSINESS AS USUAL" IS,

31:00.359 --> 31:03.930
YOU AND THE L.A.P.D.
ARE CURRENTLY BEING SUED

31:03.963 --> 31:06.432
FOR RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING
THE LIFE OF A BLACK GANG MEMBER.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.667
NOW YOU HAVE JUST GONE AND DONE
THE EXACT SAME THING AGAIN.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.237
AND THE ATTORNEY
THAT REPRESENTS TURELL BAYLOR

31:11.270 --> 31:13.539
WILL LOOK AT THIS INCIDENT
AND SAY THAT IT POINTS

31:13.572 --> 31:17.609
TO A PAST PATTERN AND PRACTICE
OF WILLFUL DISREGARD --
EXCUSE ME.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.645
ALLOW ME
TO HELP YOU HERE?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.547
CONSIDER THIS
MY PARTING GIFT.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.583
CHIEF JOHNSON HAS SHOWN
A PATTERN OF ARRESTING MURDERERS

31:24.616 --> 31:27.086
AND A PAST PRACTICE
OF GETTING CONFESSIONS

31:27.119 --> 31:28.554
THAT HOLD UP IN COURT.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.923
NO MATTER HOW UPSET YOU ARE
WITH HER ABOUT THIS,

31:30.957 --> 31:33.625
IF YOU WON'T LET HER QUIT
OVER THIS CIVIL SUIT,

31:33.659 --> 31:37.096
YOU WILL NEVER FIRE HER
OR EVEN DEMOTE HER

31:37.129 --> 31:38.230
UNTIL THIS CASE
IS DISMISSED.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.432
I SUGGEST
YOU LET CHIEF JOHNSON

31:40.466 --> 31:41.968
WRAP UP THESE MURDERS

31:42.001 --> 31:43.102
SO THAT YOU CAN ONCE AGAIN
LOOK LIKE A HERO

31:43.135 --> 31:45.237
AT HER EXPENSE.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.406
AND I WILL GO
ON MY MERRY WAY.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.946
YOU MAY HAVE CAUGHT
ANTWONE DECKER

31:53.980 --> 31:55.447
IN THE ACT
OF ATTEMPTED MURDER,

31:55.481 --> 31:58.250
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN GET HIM TO CONFESS

31:58.284 --> 32:02.054
HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THESE
EIGHT OTHER HOMICIDES?

32:02.088 --> 32:04.056
WELL, WE WON'T KNOW
IF YOU KEEP ME STANDING HERE.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.525
LOOK -- ALL THESE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN READ THEIR RIGHTS.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.727
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS FOR THEM TO CALM DOWN

32:08.760 --> 32:11.497
AND START THINKING ABOUT LAWYERS
BEFORE I INTERVIEW THEM.

32:11.530 --> 32:15.367
SO...
MAY I, PLEASE?

32:19.371 --> 32:21.373
THANK YOU.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.150
I SWEAR I DIDN'T TAKE
ANTWONE'S MONEY.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.586
I'D BE A FOOL
TRYING TO RIP HIM OFF.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.023
GOD, HE --
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

32:37.056 --> 32:40.626
MISS MURPHY,
LET'S BACK UP FOR A MOMENT.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.294
WE KNOW
THAT YOU WERE WITH CHRIS

32:42.328 --> 32:44.563
AT ANTWONE'S HOUSE
THE NIGHT HE WAS SHOT TO DEATH.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.198
WHY DID YOU LEAVE?

32:46.232 --> 32:50.102
CHRIS TOLD ME HIS BROTHER
WAS GETTING SOME GIRLS.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.305
YOU KNOW,
LIKE STRIPPERS.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.610
AND I GOT MAD.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.647
HE WANTED ME TO STAY,
BUT...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.249
WHY WERE YOU HIDING
AT DeANDRE HARMON'S HOUSE?

33:03.282 --> 33:05.117
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID,
OKAY?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.119
I FIGURED ANTWONE WAS GONNA
COME AFTER ME NEXT

33:07.153 --> 33:09.255
AND THAT HE WOULDN'T LOOK FOR ME
AT MY EX-BOYFRIEND'S.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.557
NEXT TIME YOU MIGHT
WANT TO HOLD ON TO YOUR
GIRL A LITTLE TIGHTER,

33:11.590 --> 33:14.093
YOU LITTLE PUNK. SHE'S MINE.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.428
WHY DID YOU FIGURE THAT ANTWONE
WOULD COME AFTER YOU NEXT?

33:16.462 --> 33:19.565
'CAUSE I KNEW KEVIN WAS GOING
AROUND ANTWONE'S BACK.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.700
AND ANTWONE -- HE --

33:21.733 --> 33:25.204
HE SAW DOLLAR SIGNS
WITH CHRIS...

33:25.237 --> 33:27.406
TOLD HIM THE WAY HE TURNED
HIS LIFE INTO RHYMES

33:27.439 --> 33:29.375
WOULD MAKE HIM HUGE.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.045
SO, WHEN I HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY,

33:33.079 --> 33:34.613
I KNEW IT WAS ANTWONE,

33:34.646 --> 33:37.783
AND I GOT SCARED --
RAN.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.454
FORGOT HE KNEW
I USED TO BE WITH DeANDRE.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.457
OH, GOD,
ANTWONE'S GONNA KILL US BOTH.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.563
LET'S GO.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.532
* LOOK AT ME NOW,
SHE'S ROLLIN' WITH A "G" *

33:53.565 --> 33:55.667
* SHE USED TO BE YOURS,
NOW SHE ROLLIN' WITH ME *

33:55.701 --> 33:56.668
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

33:56.702 --> 33:58.404
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

33:58.437 --> 34:01.207
* SHE'S WITH ME TONIGHT

34:01.240 --> 34:03.842
* LOOK AT ME NOW,
SHE'S ROLLIN' WITH A "G" *

34:03.875 --> 34:06.345
* SHE USED TO BE YOURS,
NOW SHE ROLLIN' WITH ME *

34:06.378 --> 34:09.148
* OKAY, ALL RIGHT

34:09.181 --> 34:13.185
* SHE'S WITH ME TONIGHT

34:13.219 --> 34:15.687
MR. HARMON, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

34:15.721 --> 34:19.658
I JUST HAVE, UH, SOME PAPERWORK
HERE FOR YOUR SIGNATURE.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.793
UH, THIS IS A COMPLAINT

34:21.827 --> 34:25.297
IN WHICH YOU ACCUSE
ANTWONE DECKER

34:25.331 --> 34:27.399
OF TRYING TO KILL YOU.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.467
AND THIS IS A FORM

34:28.500 --> 34:30.536
IN WHICH YOU BASICALLY SAY

34:30.569 --> 34:31.670
IT WAS ALL IN GOOD FUN.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.572
YOU JUST, UH,
SIGN WHICHEVER ONE

34:33.605 --> 34:35.507
YOU FEEL IS APPROPRIATE.

34:35.541 --> 34:40.179
WELL, I AIN'T ACCUSIN' DECKER
OF NOTHIN'.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.650
W
SHE ALL RIGHT?

34:44.683 --> 34:46.185
OH, SHE'S FINE.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.320
I-I DIDN'T REALIZE THE TWO
OF YOU USED TO GO OUT.

34:48.354 --> 34:49.421
OH.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.822
I TAKE IT
KEISHA TOLD YOU

34:50.856 --> 34:52.758
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO CHRIS AND KEVIN BROOKS.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.295
YOU LIVE AROUND THE CORNER
FROM EACH OTHER. IS THAT RIGHT?

34:56.328 --> 34:58.464
YEAH.
I KNEW THOSE DUDES.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.132
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.601
AND WERE YOU ALL
STILL CLOSE?

35:02.634 --> 35:04.136
YEAH. WE CLOSE, SURE.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.537
I'M -- I'M --
I'M CURIOUS

35:05.571 --> 35:08.340
AS TO WHY YOU WEREN'T
AT THAT HOUSE TWO NIGHTS AGO,

35:08.374 --> 35:09.641
CELEBRATING
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.446
I MEAN, I WAS -- I WAS THERE
THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT.

35:14.480 --> 35:19.185
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
THEY GOT BACK OFF A TOUR,

35:19.218 --> 35:20.752
AND THEY GOT BUSY,
YOU KNOW?

35:20.786 --> 35:22.321
MM.
THAT'S HOLLYWOOD, RIGHT?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.356
PEOPLE MAKE IT BIG,

35:24.390 --> 35:26.325
AND THEN THEY CAN'T BE BOTHERED
WITH THEIR OLD FRIENDS ANYMORE.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.926
WAS THAT KIND OF
WHAT IT WAS?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.861
I GUESS, MAYBE,
YOU KNOW?

35:29.895 --> 35:31.463
I MEAN, CHRIS --

35:31.497 --> 35:32.898
HE STARTED GETTING A LITTLE HEAT
FOR HIS RHYMES,

35:32.931 --> 35:35.434
AND HE HOOKED UP
WITH DECKER.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.835
AND, YOU KNOW,

35:36.868 --> 35:39.271
LIKE, WE WAS ALL GONNA TAKE
THIS RIDE TOGETHER,

35:39.305 --> 35:42.341
BUT I GUESS THE LIMO WASN'T
BIG ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.809
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.377
IT'S COOL, THOUGH.

35:45.411 --> 35:46.912
YOU KNOW, I HELPED HIM OUT
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

35:46.945 --> 35:48.647
HELPED HIM SLIP,

35:48.680 --> 35:52.551
YOU KNOW, TOLD ALL MY BOYS
THAT CHRIS WAS OFF LIMITS.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.787
SO, CHRIS AND KEVIN --
THEY WERE NEVER CRIPS?

35:58.757 --> 35:59.825
YOU KIDDING?

35:59.858 --> 36:01.193
HELL, NO.

36:02.528 --> 36:06.298
A-AND KEISHA
MET CHRIS WHEN?

36:06.332 --> 36:08.367
SIX MONTHS AGO,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.369
I MEAN, BUT THEN
HE WASN'T CHRIS NO MORE.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.603
HE WAS "C-GAME"!

36:12.738 --> 36:14.873
YEAH. WHY?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.542
I DON'T KNOW.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.910
JUST SEEMED LIKE, FIRST,
C-GAME KIND OF PUSHED YOU AWAY,

36:18.944 --> 36:21.179
AND THEN HE STOLE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.616
S

36:24.650 --> 36:28.420
NO, C-GAME DID,
IN THE LYRICS TO HIS SINGLE.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.258
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
WHAT HAPPENED.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.693
"IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON,
DO YOUR OWN THING.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.962
I'M THE NEW MAN.
YOU'RE A HAS-BEEN."

36:36.995 --> 36:40.399
NOT A LOT OF RESPECT
IN THOSE WORDS, MR. HARMON.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.602
NOT A LOT OF GRATITUDE,
NOT A LOT OF LOYALTY.

36:43.635 --> 36:48.640
"WE'RE SO FLY THAT
WE'RE CHILLIN' IN THE LEAR,

36:48.674 --> 36:51.577
AND I NEVER KNEW HOW SMALL
YOU WERE FROM UP HERE."

36:51.610 --> 36:53.245
"NEVER SLIP, NEVER FALL,

36:53.279 --> 36:54.613
"'CAUSE I'M GONNA KICK YOU
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.483
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A KING,
HOMEBOY, BOW DOWN."

36:59.385 --> 37:00.686
HE'S HUMILIATING YOU,
DeANDRE.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.824
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, LADY?

37:05.857 --> 37:07.959
WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST?

37:07.993 --> 37:11.397
I-I WAS WITH MY MOM.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.299
LOOK, MAN --
I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY

37:13.332 --> 37:14.666
OVER THAT SKANK-ASS BITCH,
MAN.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.801
THAT WAS HISTORY.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.803
I WAS DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.571
OH, I BELIEVE YOU 100%.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.574
BUT I'M HAVING THAT GUN
THAT WE FOUND AT YOUR HOUSE

37:22.608 --> 37:24.743
TESTED JUST THE SAME.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.913
AND IF IT MATCHES TO THE BULLETS
THAT WE FOUND IN C-GAME,

37:27.946 --> 37:31.049
YOU'RE GOING AWAY
FOR EIGHT COUNTS OF MURDER,

37:31.082 --> 37:35.020
AND YOUR LAWYER'S NEVER
GONNA LET YOU TALK AGAIN.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.523
THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO
SET C-GAME'S RECORD STRAIGHT.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.724
C-GAME --
WHO'S

37:38.757 --> 37:40.392
THE GUY
SLEEPING WITH KEISHA.

37:40.426 --> 37:41.893
THAT'S WHO HE WAS.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.629
NOW, DO YOU WANT
PEOPLE TO SAY

37:43.662 --> 37:45.697
THAT YOU SHOT UP C-GAME BECAUSE
SOME GIRL BROKE YOUR HEART?

37:45.731 --> 37:48.300
"CHRIS," "CHRIS," "CHRIS,"
"CHRIS," "CHRIS," "CHRIS"...

37:48.334 --> 37:50.302
OR DO YOU WANT THE WORLD
TO KNOW THAT YOU WERE
TEACHING C
..."CHRIS," "CHRIS."

37:50.336 --> 37:53.339
AIN'T NO DAMN C-GAME, MAN!
STOP SAYING THAT!

37:53.372 --> 37:56.608
THAT'S A BULLSHIT,
MADE-UP-ASS NAME, MAN,

37:56.642 --> 37:58.877
LIKE HE SOME
BIG-TIME BANGER!

37:58.910 --> 38:00.479
HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT NONE OF THAT.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.348
ALL THAT STUFF HE GOT
POPPING OFF RIGHT NOW --

38:02.381 --> 38:03.949
ALL THAT'S LUCK, MAN.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.485
I'M THE ONE WHO WATCHED OVER
HIS ASS HIS WHOLE LIFE.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.819
I PROTECTED HIM!

38:07.853 --> 38:10.356
THEN HE WANT TO COME TO MY HOOD,
TAKE MY GIRL?

38:10.389 --> 38:12.624
HE WANT TO WRITE UP SONGS
ABOUT IT,

38:12.658 --> 38:15.327
TALKING ABOUT SOME "MOVE ON"
AND "GET OVER IT,"

38:15.361 --> 38:17.796
ALL OVER THE RADIO,
ALL ON TV,

38:17.829 --> 38:19.398
GOT PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME,

38:19.431 --> 38:21.633
ASKING ME QUESTIONS
AND LAUGHING AT ME

38:21.667 --> 38:23.101
LIKE I'M SOME PUNK

38:23.134 --> 38:24.703
HELL, NO!

38:24.736 --> 38:26.838
HOMEY AIN'T EVEN GOING DOWN
LIKE THAT, MAN.

38:26.872 --> 38:31.577
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
WHEN I FIRST PULLED THE TRIGGER!

38:31.610 --> 38:33.445
YOU SHOULD HAVE LOOKED
AT HIS FACE!

38:33.479 --> 38:35.747
HE WASN'T NO C-GAME THEN!

38:35.781 --> 38:37.115
HE WASN'T NONE OF THAT!

38:37.148 --> 38:39.585
HE KNEW IT WAS GONE,
IT WAS OVER, FINISHED.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.119
NOW WHO MOVING ON, HUH?

38:41.152 --> 38:43.355
HE IS. THAT'S WHO.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.724
AND HIS BROTHER! AND TY!

38:45.757 --> 38:46.758
AND THEM BITCHES!

38:46.792 --> 38:50.496
YEAH. YEAH.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.532
THEY MOVING ON.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.402
THAT'S WHO.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.537
AND I'M HERE.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.740
SO, WHO'S LOOKING
SMALL NOW?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.843
NOT ME.

39:04.876 --> 39:05.844
NOT ME.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.695
AH.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.131
OH.
SORRY.

39:26.164 --> 39:28.834
I, UH, THOUGHT
YOU HAD LEFT ALREADY.

39:28.867 --> 39:33.138
NO, THE, UH, NEW MAINTENANCE
MANAGER'S A LITTLE OVERWHELMED

39:33.171 --> 39:35.907
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE
LEAVING.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.509
I'M JUST KILLING TIME.

39:37.543 --> 39:38.977
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.647
NO, NO, NO, I SHOULD, UH --
I SHOULD GET BACK.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.482
CHIEF JOHNSON IS SETTLING UP
HER ARRESTS

39:43.515 --> 39:46.384
BEFORE DELK GOES DOWN
TO HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.721
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.158
TAKE A LAST LOOK AROUND.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.726
YEAH.

40:02.167 --> 40:05.837
$750,000 CASH THAT USED
TO BELONG TO ANTWONE DECKER

40:05.871 --> 40:09.174
NOW BELONGS TO THE FBI,
AS LONG AS YOU SIGN HERE.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.777
I REALLY SHOULD
COUNT IT FIRST.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.178
DON'T I GET A "THANK YOU"?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.517
OH!

40:18.550 --> 40:20.786
PLEASE, COME RIGHT IN.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.054
UH...

40:23.088 --> 40:24.756
UH, SORRY
FOR INTERRUPTING.

40:26.191 --> 40:29.461
UH, DeANDRE HARMON IS ON
HIS WAY TO COUNTY RIGHT NOW.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.829
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED,

40:30.862 --> 40:34.165
GIVEN THE CONNECTIONS
THAT ANTWONE DECKER HAS,

40:34.199 --> 40:37.102
MR. HARMON MAY NOT BE SAFE
IN GENERAL POPULATION.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.604
HE SHOULD BE PLACED
UNDER PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

40:38.637 --> 40:39.971
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

40:40.005 --> 40:41.940
YES. I CAN MAKE THE TRANSFER
MYSELF IF YOU'D LIKE,

40:41.973 --> 40:44.810
AND THE TWO OF YOU CAN GET BACK
TO WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE --
FINE.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.616
THANK YOU.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.525
COULD IT BE
SOMEONE HAS YOUR BACK?

40:59.558 --> 41:01.660
SHE'S PUT SEVERAL KNIVES
IN IT ALREADY.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.096
DOING THIS JOB,

41:05.130 --> 41:06.698
REPORTING TO TAYLOR --

41:06.732 --> 41:09.701
I'D RATHER PUT PINS
IN MY EYES, I SWEAR.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.240
NOW WHAT DOES HE WANT?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.911
CHIEF JOHNSON.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.652
CHIEF JOHNSON,

41:26.685 --> 41:29.621
I'D LIKE TO COMMEND YOU
ON A JOB WELL DONE.

41:29.655 --> 41:30.656
OH --

41:30.689 --> 41:33.124
COULD BE THAT I'VE --

41:33.158 --> 41:35.293
I'VE OVERREACTED A BIT,

41:35.326 --> 41:38.163
OUR PRESENT SITUATION

41:38.196 --> 41:41.066
BEING THAT IT

41:47.939 --> 41:49.708
CHIEF!
CHIEF!

41:49.741 --> 41:50.909
CHIEF, YOU OKAY?
CHIEF!

41:50.942 --> 41:51.943
YOU OKAY?
COME ON.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.845
CHIEF, ARE YOU OKAY?
CHIEF?

41:53.879 --> 41:54.913
CLEAR HIS AIRWAY.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.314
YOU ALL RIGHT?

41:56.347 --> 41:59.751
THIS IS DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON,
MAJOR CRIMES.

41:59.785 --> 42:01.620
I NEED PARAMEDICS
ON THE NINTH FLOOR.

42:01.653 --> 42:04.022
GOT AN OFFICER DOWN. REPEAT --
WE HAVE AN OFFICER DOWN!

42:04.055 --> 42:06.592
Taylor: CHIEF, CHIEF,
COME ON, NOW. COME ON, CHIEF.
