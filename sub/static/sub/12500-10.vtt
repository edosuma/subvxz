- Gandalf.
- Aragorn!

00:03.747 --> 00:04.747
Gandalf!

00:04.748 --> 00:08.567
Denzel, there's no way Gandalf's
dick was bigger than Aragorn's.

00:08.568 --> 00:13.390
What? Not only was it bigger, he
could shoot fireballs off that shit.

00:13.391 --> 00:15.706
Look out! That guy's burning
down a village with his dick!

00:15.707 --> 00:18.604
I know for a fact that Viggo
Mortensen's hung like an Elven horse.

00:18.605 --> 00:22.140
- What, you seen it?
- Not in person. It was in a dream.

00:22.141 --> 00:25.740
Ooh, can you believe it's only
three days until J.R.R. Tol-Con?

00:25.741 --> 00:28.474
I can't wait to go with you, Denzel!

00:28.475 --> 00:29.607
<i>* Oh.</i>

00:29.608 --> 00:30.804
<i>* Oh!</i>

00:30.805 --> 00:32.607
<i>*Lord Of The Rings
is our favorite thing.</i>

00:32.607 --> 00:34.608
<i>* Lords and Orcs and magical Kings.</i>

00:34.609 --> 00:36.443
<i>* Look at that human
and Elf have a fling.</i>

00:36.444 --> 00:39.178
<i>* Gollum is trying
to steal Frodo's bling.</i>

00:39.179 --> 00:41.712
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:41.713 --> 00:43.848
Uh, what the hell are
y'all talking about?

00:43.849 --> 00:47.150
Lord Of The Rings convention. You
know, wizards and dragons and stuff.

00:47.151 --> 00:48.677
Oh, before y'all arrested me,

00:48.678 --> 00:52.785
I was on my way to a convention
filled with wizards and dragons.

00:52.786 --> 00:57.523
- For real? Y'all dress up and stuff?
- Oh, hell yeah, we do.

00:57.524 --> 01:01.064
Still better than comic-con.

01:03.031 --> 01:04.263
Aah!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.341
<i>* Brickleberry!</i>

01:06.342 --> 01:09.042
<i>* Brickleberry!</i>

01:14.004 --> 01:15.439
What's the matter, Connie?

01:15.440 --> 01:18.274
Malloy replaced my toiled
seat with a bear trap.

01:18.275 --> 01:20.195
What?

01:20.611 --> 01:22.373
What a prankster.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.560
Malloy's always been
kind of an asshole but,

01:24.561 --> 01:27.047
is it just me, or is he,
like, way worse recently?

01:27.048 --> 01:28.817
Well, if he is, I haven't noticed.

01:28.818 --> 01:30.952
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:30.953 --> 01:33.822
Ah, good, another
Doonesbury I don't get.

01:33.823 --> 01:36.057
Why is Malloy acting
out all of a sudden?

01:36.058 --> 01:39.393
Because he's a wild animal,
and Woody never disciplines him.

01:39.394 --> 01:41.295
He just gives him sugar and weapons.

01:41.296 --> 01:45.199
For your information, Dr. Phil,
I'm a harsh disciplinarian.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.323
Why, last night, Malloy
said a dirty word,

01:47.324 --> 01:49.836
and I washed his mouth out
with a bar of chocolate.

01:49.837 --> 01:51.971
Stop it, please. Aah!

01:51.972 --> 01:54.140
- Woody!
- Fine.

01:54.141 --> 01:58.941
Malloy, stop trying to
murder Steve, or else!

02:00.514 --> 02:03.249
This will teach you to ruin my fun.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.430
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

02:07.654 --> 02:10.955
"Well," he said, "I'm back".

02:10.957 --> 02:13.091
- The end.
- God damn!

02:13.092 --> 02:15.993
Now that is how you close
out an epic fantasy trilogy!

02:15.994 --> 02:18.226
I can't believe you never
read these before you met me.

02:18.227 --> 02:20.431
The only thing that gets read
in Detroit is your rights.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.500
Steve, I'm glad you opened my
eyes to this fantastical world.

02:23.501 --> 02:25.606
It helps me forget that I
work in a boring-ass park

02:25.607 --> 02:27.944
and that my best friend is
a nerd with a micro-phallus.

02:27.945 --> 02:30.240
Best friend? Thanks, pal.

02:30.241 --> 02:32.275
Tol-Con's gonna be awesome!

02:32.276 --> 02:35.247
Ooh, you have no idea.
Here's the best part.

02:35.248 --> 02:37.162
There's a costume contest?

02:37.163 --> 02:41.350
And the winner gets
to meet v-v-v...

02:41.351 --> 02:43.852
Viggo Mortensen!

02:43.853 --> 02:45.687
I've got the perfect costume!

02:45.688 --> 02:48.808
The mythical Shadowfax!

02:51.529 --> 02:53.428
The Lord of all horses!

02:53.429 --> 02:55.196
Hey, wait, what the hell?

02:55.197 --> 02:57.031
Hey! Oh! This ain't right!

02:57.032 --> 02:59.372
Stop! Help!

03:00.569 --> 03:03.104
From now on, you getting in the back.

03:03.105 --> 03:05.473
- What happened here?
- Malloy did it.

03:05.474 --> 03:07.575
Where is your little Prince Charming?

03:07.576 --> 03:09.143
Don't ask me, I'm grounded.

03:09.144 --> 03:12.780
I saw him go that way
with a flamethrower.

03:12.781 --> 03:15.583
Oh, I thought you were
bobbing for french fries again.

03:15.584 --> 03:18.752
- Where did he get a flamethrower?
- What? It was Christmas.

03:18.753 --> 03:22.889
Malloy is a troubled youth, Woody.
I should know. I used to be one.

03:22.890 --> 03:25.925
See, back when I was a kid
in Detroit, I was in a gang.

03:25.926 --> 03:29.462
We called ourselves
the cool friends gang.

03:29.463 --> 03:33.599
And when I say we were hard-core,
I mean we were hard-core!

03:33.600 --> 03:35.167
Get outta the sleigh, bitch!

03:35.168 --> 03:37.868
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

03:42.011 --> 03:44.476
Whoa, Denzel was in a gang!

03:44.477 --> 03:47.245
Let's all take a moment to soak
in that startling revelation.

03:47.246 --> 03:50.615
- This is serious, Woody.
- Ah, you're all overreacting.

03:50.616 --> 03:55.596
Malloy hasn't gotten
into any real trouble yet.

03:59.358 --> 04:02.337
3 counts of grand theft
auto, 137 moving violations,

04:02.338 --> 04:05.863
12 counts of attempted vehicular homicide,
and he called my partner a [Bleep] dipshit.

04:05.864 --> 04:09.767
First of all, I don't know where he
could have heard language like that.

04:09.768 --> 04:12.170
Second, your partner looks
like a [Bleep] dipshit.

04:12.171 --> 04:15.340
If this bear steps foot in our town
again, we're throwing him in prison.

04:15.341 --> 04:21.241
Prison? Don't worry, officers. I'll make
sure nothing like this ever happens again.

04:22.181 --> 04:25.140
Oh, God. Maybe he is out of control.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.601
What am I gonna do?

04:26.602 --> 04:30.655
I think it's time I made a call to my boys
in Detroit to scare this bear straight.

04:30.656 --> 04:33.224
Right after I practice
galloping as a mythical horse.

04:33.225 --> 04:35.385
Aw, man!

04:38.197 --> 04:39.779
There come my boys.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.980
The baddest gangstas in Detroit. What?

04:45.304 --> 04:47.839
Good afternoon, Denzel.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.442
These Urkels are gonna
scare Malloy straight?

04:50.443 --> 04:52.911
They're wearing goddamn penny loafers!

04:52.912 --> 04:54.947
Wow. You guys look different.

04:54.948 --> 04:57.026
Y'all still gang banging,
right, murder bone?

04:57.027 --> 05:01.728
Oh, no. I teach Jewish-African-American
studies at the Community College.

05:01.729 --> 05:03.692
And I own a Kia dealership.

05:03.693 --> 05:05.671
Bug eyes here does the marketing for me.

05:05.672 --> 05:10.228
Iba beebe settum uppa theeba big
wavy men and inflatababull gobarillas.

05:10.229 --> 05:15.449
Yeah, he never really
recovered from that drive-by.

05:16.503 --> 05:20.643
Oh, great. Now we have four Denzels?

05:24.459 --> 05:28.413
So this is the little punk
bitch who thinks he's a criminal.

05:28.414 --> 05:31.291
Yeah, well, you eye to eye
with some real criminals, bitch!

05:31.292 --> 05:33.890
I assumed, but it sounds
racist when I say it.

05:33.891 --> 05:36.459
Back in the day, we got
in some serious shit.

05:36.460 --> 05:41.464
Carjacking, pushing dope, breeding
midgets and fighting them to the death.

05:41.465 --> 05:43.432
Okay, that last one caught me off guard.

05:43.433 --> 05:45.168
Shit was for real, Malloy.

05:45.169 --> 05:47.837
We had no rules and
didn't respect the law.

05:47.838 --> 05:50.912
We just ran around, doing whatever
we wanted, whenever we wanted.

05:50.913 --> 05:51.921
Yeahbada!

05:51.922 --> 05:54.009
That sounds awesome. Why'd you stop?

05:54.010 --> 05:56.199
Yeah, why did we stop?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.814
Because we turned our
lives around, fool!

05:58.815 --> 06:00.649
But you may not be so lucky.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.585
So you guys used to be bad asses.

06:02.586 --> 06:05.220
Now you're the target demo for HGTV.

06:05.221 --> 06:06.655
Where do I sign up?

06:06.656 --> 06:08.807
- We still know how to get down.
- Yeah.

06:08.808 --> 06:11.561
Just last week, I bought
a bumper pool table!

06:11.562 --> 06:15.527
Last Friday my wife left for a conference
in Tulsa and I got to masturbate!

06:15.528 --> 06:19.103
Iba collect recipes offba Pinterest.

06:19.104 --> 06:21.706
Oh, he's right. Our lives suck.

06:21.707 --> 06:24.575
Remember old officer
Pulaski with the gimp leg?

06:24.576 --> 06:25.843
Used to chase us like this?

06:25.844 --> 06:28.661
- "Hey, mother[Bleep]! Get over here!"
- "Hey! Hey!"

06:28.662 --> 06:31.582
"Get over here, little mother[Bleep]!"

06:31.583 --> 06:34.057
Then we shot him in the face.

06:34.058 --> 06:35.792
Feels good to laugh again.

06:35.793 --> 06:37.660
See? That's the spirit.

06:37.661 --> 06:41.130
Guys, I don't mean to play doctor, but
you've all got a case of the "no funsies".

06:41.131 --> 06:43.132
That's what we get for sharing needles.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.265
Man, the bear's right. I'm bored.

06:45.266 --> 06:46.489
Meba tooba.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.910
I drive a goddamn minivan.

06:49.913 --> 06:52.308
What do you say we hit the
town and have some real fun?

06:52.309 --> 06:53.526
- Yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

06:53.527 --> 06:54.375
Hold on.

06:54.376 --> 06:57.562
You're supposed to be scaring the bear
straight, not declaring the bear's great!

06:57.563 --> 07:00.683
Don't be a punk, D. We about
to tear shit up old school.

07:00.684 --> 07:02.818
- You in or out?
- Uh, in?

07:02.819 --> 07:05.921
So, cubsy wubsy, did my
homeboys scare you straight yet?

07:05.922 --> 07:07.589
Suck it, cracker!

07:07.590 --> 07:10.890
- Yeah!
- Yeah, take it!

07:14.397 --> 07:17.333
Denzel, hey, there you are. I've
been looking all over for you.

07:17.334 --> 07:20.336
You didn't show for Shadowfax
practice. Everything okay?

07:20.337 --> 07:23.606
Whoa, hold up. Who the
[Bleep] is this hookey donkey?

07:23.607 --> 07:26.009
I get it! He's a hookey donkey.

07:26.010 --> 07:30.035
We're Shadowfax, the Lord of all horses.

07:30.036 --> 07:32.661
- Tell 'em, Denzel.
- Denzel, you're friends with this guy?

07:32.662 --> 07:34.302
Oh, don't pay attention
to Steve, fellas.

07:34.303 --> 07:37.025
He's just a local pedophile we keep
around to clean out the shitters.

07:37.026 --> 07:41.706
Now let's go! Later,
local pedophile Steve.

07:49.199 --> 07:52.634
You guys have gotten pretty soft. You
sure you still know how to commit crimes?

07:52.635 --> 07:54.369
Of course we do.

07:54.370 --> 07:57.573
I said, "I want a small
business loan," mother[Bleep]!

07:57.574 --> 08:01.644
What do you mean this Zumba
Groupon's expired, mother[Bleep]?

08:01.645 --> 08:07.383
I sabida, "putta my child in your
pribata schoobada, moboda fuboda!"

08:07.384 --> 08:10.686
Someone please tell me
what the hell he just said.

08:10.687 --> 08:15.023
Yo, your kids are gonna love it here.
They got an excellent drama department.

08:15.024 --> 08:17.724
Freeze, scumbags!

08:18.093 --> 08:23.733
I don't like this at all.
Way too many blacks in here.

08:26.458 --> 08:30.298
Turn to the right. Eyes forward.

08:33.331 --> 08:38.071
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm Warden Smalls.

08:38.706 --> 08:41.285
Electric chair!

08:42.883 --> 08:47.044
Anyway, I run a fair and
honorable Christian prison here.

08:47.045 --> 08:50.547
Rule number one... no sarcasm.

08:50.548 --> 08:52.816
Aw, that's a great rule.

08:52.817 --> 08:55.919
Well, looks like we got us a rebel here.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.900
Try this on for size.

08:57.901 --> 08:59.693
Ow! Why'd you hit me?

08:59.694 --> 09:01.351
Because as the Bible says,

09:01.352 --> 09:05.462
it's much more painful to watch
your friend suffer for your sins.

09:05.463 --> 09:07.764
Oh, yeah, it is.

09:07.765 --> 09:09.964
That sounds like more sarcasm, boy.

09:09.965 --> 09:12.702
- Unh!
- Oh, no, please, stop.

09:12.703 --> 09:14.806
I'll break you of that sarcasm, son,

09:14.807 --> 09:18.207
if I have to break every billy
club over your friend's head.

09:18.208 --> 09:22.045
Ow! Hey! Ah, stop! Oh! God damn!

09:22.046 --> 09:26.916
Um, hey, Warden, that's a really
nice tie. Take that, Malloy!

09:26.917 --> 09:28.317
Ow! Wait, wait, wait!

09:28.318 --> 09:30.353
I thought my friend had
to suffer for my sins.

09:30.354 --> 09:32.332
I was being sarcastic, idiot!

09:32.333 --> 09:34.256
Welcome to Hazelhurst prison.

09:34.257 --> 09:37.353
I guarantee you boys
gonna stay in line...

09:37.354 --> 09:41.554
Or my name isn't Warden Tiny Smalls.

09:41.569 --> 09:44.149
Electric chair!

09:48.538 --> 09:50.807
Scare me straight,
huh? Good plan, Woody.

09:50.808 --> 09:53.876
When we get home, I'm gonna
spank the shit out of you!

09:53.877 --> 09:55.311
You're not going home, Malloy.

09:55.312 --> 09:57.346
You're staying here until
you've learned a lesson.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.715
Oh, you're getting
an angry spanking now!

09:59.716 --> 10:02.284
- Get me out of here, Woody.
- Well, I... no!

10:02.285 --> 10:04.886
No, I made my decision,
and I'm sticking to it!

10:04.887 --> 10:06.922
Good-bye, Malloy!

10:06.923 --> 10:08.890
Be strong, Papa Bear.

10:08.891 --> 10:13.391
Don't look back. It's called tough love.

10:14.375 --> 10:15.676
Oh, what the...

10:15.677 --> 10:20.717
What the hell's wrong
with you? Leave me alone!

10:22.605 --> 10:25.341
Damn, I don't remember prison
being this scary back in the day.

10:25.342 --> 10:28.978
Oh, come on, Denzel. It ain't that bad.

10:28.979 --> 10:31.055
Ohba, shibbit!

10:31.056 --> 10:34.232
- Man, we're gonna die in here!
- Chill out, D. There's four of us.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.285
As long as we stick
together, we'll be fine.

10:36.286 --> 10:37.854
That's right, suckas!

10:37.855 --> 10:40.924
Nobody's gonna mess with
the cool friends gang!

10:40.925 --> 10:43.693
Who wants to step to this, huh? Nobody?

10:43.694 --> 10:45.795
That's what I thou...

10:45.796 --> 10:48.999
They call me "Meat Hammer,"
because I got a Meat Hammer.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.067
And I don't mean a tenderizing utensil.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.403
- Got it.
- I mean a Meat Hammer.

10:53.404 --> 10:54.871
- Uh huh.
- In my pants.

10:54.872 --> 10:56.606
- Following you.
- You know what?

10:56.607 --> 10:59.075
I'm just gonna go ahead
and spell it out for you.

10:59.076 --> 11:03.576
- I'm referring to my dick.
- I got it!

11:06.350 --> 11:09.185
'Sup, bitch? Como se llama, ese?

11:09.186 --> 11:11.954
Of course I'd like chips and
salsa. You guys got any queso?

11:11.955 --> 11:16.158
Hey, watch your mouth, son! This
is Paco, leader of the Latin Kings.

11:16.159 --> 11:18.227
That's a weird name for
a landscaping company.

11:18.228 --> 11:19.795
What? I'm gonna kill...

11:19.796 --> 11:22.398
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, who's there?

11:22.399 --> 11:25.468
- Amish Hank.
- Uh, amish Hank who?

11:25.469 --> 11:29.249
- I'ma shank you!
- Hey! Hey!

11:31.609 --> 11:33.362
Mm.

11:33.363 --> 11:34.444
Mm.

11:34.445 --> 11:38.659
Yeah, it's been real lonely in
here since my last cellmate died.

11:38.660 --> 11:39.756
How'd he die?

11:39.757 --> 11:44.688
The Doc in the infirmary said his
anus got turned inside out... somehow.

11:44.689 --> 11:47.657
- You boys are free to go.
- Yeah, that's what I thought!

11:47.658 --> 11:50.026
Can't no prison contain
the cool friends gang.

11:50.027 --> 11:52.229
- Move out my way!
- Not you, son.

11:52.230 --> 11:54.764
- Just your friends.
- Yeah, man, sorry about that.

11:54.765 --> 11:57.200
I could only call in
favors for the three of us.

11:57.201 --> 11:58.701
Hey, what about sticking together?

11:58.702 --> 12:00.852
The only thing you need
to be concerned about

12:00.853 --> 12:02.938
sticking together is your butt cheeks.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.240
Mm.

12:04.241 --> 12:06.842
You gonna be doing a hard 12 in here.

12:06.843 --> 12:09.545
And I don't mean 12 years of hard time.

12:09.546 --> 12:12.906
- I mean 12...
- I know!

12:13.417 --> 12:16.152
All right, everyone, thank
you for coming to audition.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.996
As you know, my ex-best friend Denzel

12:18.997 --> 12:21.391
is rotting in a prison
because he's a class-a jerk.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.671
Which means one of you is going
to replace him as my partner

12:24.672 --> 12:27.230
in the Tol-Con costume contest.

12:27.231 --> 12:30.534
Contest? Craigslist
said "horse costume".

12:30.535 --> 12:33.203
I thought this was a
furry freak sex party!

12:33.204 --> 12:37.404
This is not a furry freak sex party.

12:38.576 --> 12:39.976
Jorge, wait!

12:39.977 --> 12:43.747
What I meant was, we're
going to a furry sex party.

12:43.748 --> 12:49.648
Yes! You haven't lived till you've
contracted herpes from a gigantic squirrel!

12:56.560 --> 12:59.763
<i>* Gonna visit my cubsy
wubs in the big, scary prison.</i>

12:59.764 --> 13:02.065
<i>* Gonna bring him home because
he has learned his lesson.</i>

13:02.066 --> 13:04.646
What the hell?

13:04.835 --> 13:07.537
Okay, so look, Vato,
Tuco over in cell 31?

13:07.538 --> 13:09.906
He shows me no respect. He's gotta go.

13:09.907 --> 13:11.508
Yo, I'll take care of it.

13:11.509 --> 13:14.569
Wait, but I am Tuco.

13:17.548 --> 13:18.882
Cubsy wubs?

13:18.883 --> 13:20.951
What'd you call our leader, ese?

13:20.952 --> 13:23.286
You want for me to make
this bitch ass dead?

13:23.287 --> 13:26.481
No, that's cool, dog. I think I
remember this fool from back in the hood.

13:26.482 --> 13:28.458
What happened to you, Malloy?

13:28.459 --> 13:31.528
Nothing happened to me,
gringo. This is my family now.

13:31.529 --> 13:34.531
Julio, is that my moon pie?

13:34.532 --> 13:38.034
I knew it, Malloy! I knew
tough love was a bad idea!

13:38.035 --> 13:40.704
I never should've listened
to those asshole Rangers.

13:40.705 --> 13:43.873
Don't you worry. Daddy is
gonna bust you outta here.

13:43.874 --> 13:46.342
Bust me out? This is my home, homes.

13:46.343 --> 13:47.576
I ain't going nowhere.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.246
Brah, I heard Vato
killed Julio and Tuco.

13:50.247 --> 13:54.387
He is out of control. Take him out.

14:00.735 --> 14:03.503
Okay, Jorge, there's the
line for the costume contest.

14:03.504 --> 14:06.006
When does the furry sex commence?

14:06.007 --> 14:08.575
My sack grows tight with anticipation!

14:08.576 --> 14:10.117
In a minute. Come on.

14:10.118 --> 14:12.023
Left, right, left.

14:12.024 --> 14:13.772
Shorten your gait.

14:13.773 --> 14:15.568
- Come on.
- What the... what the [Bleep]?

14:15.569 --> 14:17.839
Denzel could do it.
What's so hard about this?

14:17.840 --> 14:22.048
Because my eyes sting from the
fumes coming from your anus.

14:22.049 --> 14:25.829
You smell like the Middle East!

14:26.920 --> 14:29.455
Hey, great Gollum costume.

14:29.456 --> 14:32.156
I have Progeria.

14:32.793 --> 14:36.096
Okay, we're next! I think we've
still got a shot at winning.

14:36.097 --> 14:38.998
- I'm sorry, you're disqualified.
- What? Why?

14:38.999 --> 14:42.230
Yeah, you're disqualified because you're
missing the back half of your costume.

14:42.231 --> 14:43.269
Jorge!

14:43.270 --> 14:45.972
You are the biggest,
sexiest furry in here.

14:45.973 --> 14:48.474
Tell me, what are you, a bear? Huh?

14:48.475 --> 14:49.575
A gorilla?

14:49.576 --> 14:52.456
I'm Peter Jackson.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.216
Here, relax. Have some toilet wine.

14:57.217 --> 15:00.053
Nah, nah, I'm good. I had a
bunch of shitter sake earlier.

15:00.054 --> 15:03.323
Now, I don't want to just make love.
We should get to know each other.

15:03.324 --> 15:06.994
Ooh, good idea. We should have
lots of long conversations.

15:06.995 --> 15:08.695
- What's your favorite color?
- Blue.

15:08.696 --> 15:10.793
- Okay, let's do it.
- What? Aah!

15:10.794 --> 15:12.799
Hey, hey, that's not gonna
fit! It ain't gonna fit!

15:12.800 --> 15:14.501
Not so fast!

15:14.502 --> 15:17.671
You cannot have sex with this man.

15:17.672 --> 15:20.340
Oh, thank you, baby Jesus!

15:20.341 --> 15:24.303
- Until after you marry him.
- Wait, come again?

15:24.304 --> 15:26.993
I run a good Christian prison here.

15:26.994 --> 15:30.198
And I don't allow any
intercourse under my roof

15:30.199 --> 15:34.554
unless you share a
union in the eyes of God.

15:34.555 --> 15:36.123
Call the caterer, boys.

15:36.124 --> 15:38.725
We're having us a gay prison wedding!

15:38.726 --> 15:41.328
Oh, boy! We're getting married!

15:41.329 --> 15:44.664
- Wait, what's the rush?
- I'm a romantic.

15:44.665 --> 15:47.365
And I got AIDS.

15:47.935 --> 15:49.369
All right, Brickleberry's finest.

15:49.370 --> 15:51.426
Denzel's about to become a human condom,

15:51.427 --> 15:54.708
and my poor little baby has been
brainwashed by a gang of landscapers.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.810
And we are gonna bust 'em both out.

15:56.811 --> 16:00.380
Bust them out? That prison's harder
to get into than a sheep's panties.

16:00.381 --> 16:03.784
True, Hazelhurst penitentiary
is notorious for two things...

16:03.785 --> 16:08.889
One, its airtight security, and two, its
fondness for forced homosexual weddings.

16:08.890 --> 16:11.525
We're gonna pose as a
wedding events crew, slip in,

16:11.526 --> 16:14.519
and be gone with our friends
before the rice pilaf is even cold.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.398
Oh, my God, I've always
wanted to plan a wedding!

16:17.399 --> 16:20.268
Easy there, Bridezilla.
You're on cake and flowers.

16:20.269 --> 16:24.606
- Connie, you're the photographer.
- Can I grab a couple titty pics of Ethel?

16:24.607 --> 16:26.350
Firecracker Jim, you're on demolition.

16:26.351 --> 16:29.277
When you hear, "dun, duh, dun,
dun, dun," blow us an escape route!

16:29.278 --> 16:33.047
Hell, yeah! Blowing shit
up was my major in college!

16:33.048 --> 16:35.249
I didn't know
Brickleberry had a college.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.841
That's because I blew it up!

16:36.842 --> 16:39.853
Them prison guards are gonna be
packing a lot of heat, but so will we.

16:39.854 --> 16:42.389
When they start firing at us, poom!

16:42.390 --> 16:44.925
Hey, look at me! I'm
like a stripper with guns!

16:44.926 --> 16:49.030
Just like Granny Possumcods. She used to
hold us at gunpoint and give us lap dances.

16:49.031 --> 16:50.198
I love Christmas.

16:50.199 --> 16:54.039
All right, team, let's do this.

16:55.337 --> 16:57.305
Hola, negro.

16:57.306 --> 17:01.842
Me and my boys just wanted to come down
and give you a little wedding present.

17:01.843 --> 17:04.810
- Sweet, a shank.
- No, it's a toothbrush.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.560
I figured you should have fresh breath

17:06.561 --> 17:10.518
while Meat Hammer turns
your asshole inside out.

17:10.519 --> 17:13.164
Oh, no! How are we gonna
get past the guards?

17:13.165 --> 17:17.258
Now everybody just stay cool. I
got a whole back story worked out.

17:17.259 --> 17:19.593
Good day, mate. Name's Rick Swordfire.

17:19.594 --> 17:22.430
I'm a bisexual Pisces
who loves analingus.

17:22.431 --> 17:23.897
How do you spell your last name?

17:23.898 --> 17:26.419
Uh, uh, uh...

17:26.792 --> 17:28.713
Uh...

17:29.102 --> 17:32.162
All right. Let's go!

17:37.307 --> 17:40.159
- Hey, buddy, you okay?
- No, not really.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.345
I got screwed over by my best friend.

17:42.346 --> 17:44.550
Now I'll probably never
get to meet my hero.

17:44.551 --> 17:46.882
Come on, man. Sure you will.

17:46.883 --> 17:49.523
Viggo Mortens...

17:50.419 --> 17:53.409
Life is too short to be
mad at your best friend.

17:53.410 --> 17:56.524
You're right, Viggo. And
now he's in a lot of trouble.

17:56.525 --> 17:58.493
He's being forced to
marry this guy in prison.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.896
What? You need to help your
friend. Think like a Hobbit, man.

18:01.897 --> 18:05.567
You think that, uh, "Fredo"
would allow "Gandar" to...

18:05.568 --> 18:09.245
He'd use the invisibility,
uh, necklace, uh...

18:09.246 --> 18:14.826
All right, I'm sorry. I never
saw those goddamn movies.

18:22.452 --> 18:24.533
When that guy's done
with Denzel's rectum,

18:24.534 --> 18:29.334
people will pay to see
Evel Knievel jump it.

18:35.098 --> 18:38.818
Okay, Firecracker Jim, blow it!

18:41.905 --> 18:44.607
Those inbred hillbillies
[Bleep] up their cue!

18:44.608 --> 18:45.875
Yeah, sorry about that.

18:45.876 --> 18:48.311
What the hell are you guys doing here?

18:48.312 --> 18:51.047
Well, yeah, we kinda got
arrested on the way over here.

18:51.048 --> 18:55.117
Turns out smoking meth while
driving is a parole violation.

18:55.118 --> 18:59.588
God damn it. Well, at least we've still
got a giant wedding cake filled with guns.

18:59.589 --> 19:02.153
Yeah, about that, there was
just no way to get the guns

19:02.154 --> 19:04.894
inside without messing up the
lavender buttercream frosting.

19:04.895 --> 19:05.995
Sorry.

19:05.996 --> 19:10.690
Ethel, are you telling me that rather
than springing Malloy and Denzel,

19:10.691 --> 19:14.069
we're actually here to
cater a goddamn wedding?

19:14.070 --> 19:17.850
No, a beautiful goddamn wedding!

19:23.380 --> 19:26.493
Dearly incarcerated, we
are gathered to witness

19:26.494 --> 19:30.306
the union between
Meat Hammer and Denzel.

19:30.307 --> 19:32.345
Which shall last forever.

19:32.346 --> 19:37.435
For while gay marriage may
be legal in our fine state...

19:37.436 --> 19:40.002
Gay divorce is not.

19:40.003 --> 19:45.800
Meat Hammer, do you take Denzel to be
your lawfully wedded gay prison partner?

19:45.801 --> 19:47.135
You bet I do.

19:47.136 --> 19:51.336
And, Denzel, do you take Meat Hammer?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.343
Say it. You better say it.

19:54.344 --> 19:57.044
I, uh... I d...

20:01.884 --> 20:04.152
Holy shit! Is that Viggo Mortensen?

20:04.153 --> 20:06.488
Man, his career is in the shitter!

20:06.489 --> 20:12.009
I, Lord Of The Rings, command
you... stop this wedding!

20:16.068 --> 20:18.103
Steve, you saved me!

20:18.104 --> 20:19.804
That's what best friends are for!

20:19.805 --> 20:22.240
- Look, Steve, I'm sorry for...
- Already forgiven.

20:22.241 --> 20:24.642
Now let's get you out of here
the quickest way possible...

20:24.643 --> 20:27.244
As two grown men in a horse suit.

20:27.245 --> 20:29.112
Sounds good. I'll take it from here.

20:29.113 --> 20:30.530
Wait a minute!

20:30.531 --> 20:33.325
This is not a furry fook fest either!

20:33.326 --> 20:34.952
Let's ride, Steve!

20:34.953 --> 20:37.221
Giddyup, partner!

20:37.222 --> 20:40.390
No, no, leave me! I love it here!

20:40.391 --> 20:43.031
Shadowfax, away!

20:45.296 --> 20:49.555
Now if somebody could only explain
to me what the [Bleep] just happened?
