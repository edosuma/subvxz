spend some time as a family.

get to do that anymore.

01:04.135 --> 01:05.101
Five weeks?

01:05.135 --> 01:07.103
That was all shot
in one afternoon.

01:07.138 --> 01:09.038
Shh. That's a
TV secret.

01:09.073 --> 01:11.808
All I'm saying is that
last time we came here

01:11.842 --> 01:14.544
was one of the best days
this family's had together.

01:14.578 --> 01:16.212
Look how happy we were.

01:18.749 --> 01:20.150
Francine, they don't care.

01:20.184 --> 01:21.718
They're all on their
mobile devices.

01:21.752 --> 01:23.153
They're in their own world.

can you please tell them

01:25.956 --> 01:28.024
to put down their iPads
for a second?

01:28.058 --> 01:30.460
Francine, I'm trying to
concentrate on the road.

01:30.494 --> 01:31.995

Whatever.

01:39.703 --> 01:41.204
Mom's cinnamon cookies!

Terrific. No one
cares about me,

01:43.774 --> 01:45.708
they just care

I don't even care

02:16.040 --> 02:17.740
I don't have a family.

02:21.912 --> 02:24.180

02:24.215 --> 02:26.416
I have a fetish
for family things.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.486
I know the word "fetish"
makes it sound sexual.

and the founder
of the park, Roy Family.

02:47.538 --> 02:49.472
Wasn't Roy Family
a total weirdo?

02:49.507 --> 02:51.274
Yep, I heard he was
cryogenically frozen

02:51.308 --> 02:53.643
somewhere in the park
and that he used to have

02:53.677 --> 02:56.012
two tamed caterpillars
as a mustache.

02:56.046 --> 02:58.181
Are you sure you're not

03:08.726 --> 03:10.627
You're such a cynic.

03:10.661 --> 03:13.363
Okay, everybody,
what should we do first?

03:13.397 --> 03:14.564
I know what I'm doing.

03:14.598 --> 03:16.432
Straight to Cartoon City.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.001
It's where Mikey Muskrat

03:18.035 --> 03:19.736
and all of his cartoon pals

03:19.770 --> 03:21.504
go about their daily lives.

03:21.539 --> 03:24.374
They live, they laugh,
they love, they learn.

03:24.408 --> 03:25.808
They're just like us, really.

03:25.843 --> 03:26.809
Except they don't bleed,

03:26.844 --> 03:28.444
and most of them wear bow ties

03:28.479 --> 03:29.812
and gloves but not pants.

03:29.847 --> 03:30.980
Forget Cartoon City.

03:31.015 --> 03:32.949
I'm gonna go
to Wild Wild West World

03:32.983 --> 03:35.051
and ride
Brokeback Splash Mountain.

03:35.085 --> 03:37.086

Can you picture
what these idiots

03:41.825 --> 03:43.059
think space looks like?

03:43.093 --> 03:46.429
It's gonna be Ground Control
to Major Lame.

03:46.463 --> 03:48.531
Oh. I guess
that was kinda lame.

03:48.566 --> 03:50.800
Yeah? Well, I'm going
to Fairytale Land

03:50.834 --> 03:52.936
to teach little girls
that princesses

03:52.970 --> 03:55.104
are an outdated
stereotype perpetuated

03:55.139 --> 03:57.206
by a male-dominated
society.

03:57.241 --> 03:58.808
Well, good news.

03:58.842 --> 04:01.477
There's time for us
to do everything together.

04:01.512 --> 04:03.446
We can start in Cartoon City,

04:03.480 --> 04:05.381
and then head over
to Simpler Times Mountain

04:05.416 --> 04:09.018

05:00.337 --> 05:02.505
and do whatever he says.

05:02.539 --> 05:04.007
Don't listen to her.

05:04.041 --> 05:06.576
You don't need a boy
to define your identity.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.012
You're a strong,
independent girl.

05:09.046 --> 05:11.114

05:11.148 --> 05:12.682

something you think

05:12.716 --> 05:14.117
shouldn't be asked
of a princess.

05:14.151 --> 05:17.420
Because he'll find
a princess who will.

Guards, kill him!

11:05.217 --> 11:06.317
It's fine.

11:06.351 --> 11:07.652
Let him speak.

11:07.686 --> 11:09.253
Kill him later, got it.

11:09.288 --> 11:12.590
My king, I've returned from
my raid on Fairytale Land.

11:12.624 --> 11:14.392
I bring you churros.

11:14.426 --> 11:16.728
Churros to last a week.

11:18.197 --> 11:19.430
These are days old!

11:19.465 --> 11:22.700
And you've brought
no dipping sauce!

11:22.735 --> 11:24.335
Can we can kill him now?

11:24.369 --> 11:26.804
I don't want you to think
it's the only thing

11:26.839 --> 11:30.808
I'm focused on, but it's
all I can think about.

11:37.483 --> 11:39.917
Oh, I remember this ride.

11:39.952 --> 11:41.886
It was one of
the kids' favorites.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.721
It looks abandoned.

11:43.756 --> 11:44.989
Maybe we can hide out here

11:45.023 --> 11:46.824
until everyone
comes to their senses.

11:46.859 --> 11:48.526
Great idea.

11:51.563 --> 11:53.865
I wonder why they closed this.

11:53.899 --> 11:56.100
I remember it being
very popular.

11:56.135 --> 11:57.268
Well, no one's here.

11:57.302 --> 11:59.337
Let's give it a whirl.

11:59.371 --> 12:01.839
(banjo music playing)

12:03.208 --> 12:05.209
Hello, I'm Pappy Van Pappy.

12:05.244 --> 12:07.011
I'd like to tell you a story

12:07.045 --> 12:09.514
about a rabbit I owned
that ran away.

12:09.548 --> 12:10.948
The rabbit's a metaphor.

12:10.983 --> 12:12.216
For a slave.

12:12.251 --> 12:14.152
Ain't that right,
Floppy Rabbit?

12:14.186 --> 12:17.021
Hmm. This ride
may be a bit dated.

12:17.055 --> 12:19.490
Well, it certainly
has my attention.

12:19.525 --> 12:21.092
And that's when I realized

12:21.126 --> 12:23.261
I like working
on farms for free.

12:23.295 --> 12:24.729
Bye, everybody!

12:24.763 --> 12:26.597
Wow.

12:26.632 --> 12:29.700
25 minutes
of uninterrupted racism.

12:29.735 --> 12:32.503
Yeah, if you don't count
all of your horrified gasps

12:32.538 --> 12:34.505
as interruptions.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.707
I wonder where
that elevator goes.

12:36.742 --> 12:39.410
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

12:39.444 --> 12:41.179
(elevator bell dings)

12:42.114 --> 12:44.081
Hello, Francine.

12:44.116 --> 12:46.250
Roy Family?

12:46.285 --> 12:47.251
But-but you...

12:47.286 --> 12:48.586
Was frozen?

12:48.620 --> 12:50.254
You're right, I were.

12:50.289 --> 12:52.356
But now I wasn't.

12:52.391 --> 12:54.926
Attention denizens
of Familyland.

12:56.595 --> 12:59.964
Now, times are trying
and rations run low,

12:59.998 --> 13:02.767
and I'm sure all of you'd
really like to go home.

13:02.801 --> 13:07.238
Which is why Uncle Roy's decided
to let the last army standing

13:07.272 --> 13:09.440
walk out the front door.

13:09.474 --> 13:11.475
(laughs maniacally)

13:12.711 --> 13:15.713
I'm gonna kill the
last army standing, too.

13:15.747 --> 13:18.115
I just wanted to say
I am a <i>big</i> fan

13:18.150 --> 13:20.117
of Simpler Times Mountain.

13:23.565 --> 13:25.166
I don't understand.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.667
You trapped us in the park

13:26.702 --> 13:29.303
so you could
watch us all kill each other?

13:29.338 --> 13:31.857
And-and why were you
frozen for 30 years?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.244
Answer that last one first.

13:33.278 --> 13:34.478
Try not to tell me what to do.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.896
I built Familyland
to be an Eden,

13:37.099 --> 13:39.433
and I wanted to see it
come to fruition.

13:39.468 --> 13:42.403
So I froze my body,
but not my mind,

13:42.437 --> 13:44.071
right in the center of the park.

13:44.106 --> 13:46.741
That way, I could
watch it all happen.

13:46.775 --> 13:49.210
You were conscious
that whole time?

13:49.244 --> 13:50.678
Oh, yeah, it was awful.

13:50.712 --> 13:53.214
And I had to watch what
happened to my creation.

13:53.248 --> 13:55.282
My park.

13:55.317 --> 13:59.253
Tainted by people who don't
appreciate the value of family.

13:59.287 --> 14:01.856
So, since they
destroyed my dreams,

14:01.890 --> 14:04.759
they can destroy each other.

14:04.793 --> 14:08.362
But... but
I appreciate family.

14:08.397 --> 14:09.964
That has to count
for something.

14:09.998 --> 14:11.365
It does, Francine.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.000
You and I are of a kind.

14:13.035 --> 14:15.903
Which is why we're going to
watch the blood blath together.

14:15.937 --> 14:17.805
Did you just say "blath"?

14:17.839 --> 14:20.041
My tongue's been
frozen for 30 years.

14:20.075 --> 14:23.077
But don't worry,
it'll thaw out.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.152
Today, we go from tweens...

14:31.186 --> 14:32.820
to teens!

14:32.854 --> 14:33.954
(crowd cheering)

14:33.989 --> 14:36.824
Today, we fight for respect!

14:36.858 --> 14:38.526
(crowd cheering)

14:38.560 --> 14:41.228
If we fight hard enough,
will we get husbands?

14:41.263 --> 14:43.064
No!

14:43.098 --> 14:46.367
Ugh, okay, I'll explain
this one more time.

14:46.401 --> 14:47.935
Are there
going to be casualties?

14:47.969 --> 14:48.936
Maybe.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.504
But we're mostly grown men,

14:50.539 --> 14:52.940
and one of the armies
is entirely made up of children.

14:52.974 --> 14:55.309
I don't want to jinx it,
but I like our chances

14:55.343 --> 14:57.244
of going completely
casualty-free.

14:57.279 --> 15:00.748
Okay, I just realized
your laser guns aren't real.

15:00.782 --> 15:02.083
So I have a new strategy,

15:02.117 --> 15:04.452
and you're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.619
Die for me.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.555
Die... for me.

15:07.589 --> 15:08.722
Okay?

15:08.757 --> 15:11.058
Any questions?

15:11.093 --> 15:12.793
No questions, good.

15:17.032 --> 15:18.165
Nice, isn't it?

15:18.200 --> 15:19.633
This is where
we'll live, Francine,

15:19.668 --> 15:21.569
and you'll have
all the love and respect

15:21.603 --> 15:23.104
a woman like you deserves.

15:23.138 --> 15:26.107
What makes you think
I'd ever marry you?

15:26.141 --> 15:27.341
Marry?
(chuckles)

15:27.375 --> 15:28.776
Listen to her.

15:28.810 --> 15:30.344
Captive for a half an hour

15:30.378 --> 15:32.646
and already trying
to flip it on me.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.149
Sorry, this guy
can't be caught,

15:35.183 --> 15:37.785
but I encourage you to try.

15:39.054 --> 15:40.921
So why don't you
get going on some dinner.

15:40.956 --> 15:43.457
But you just said
you couldn't be caught.

15:43.492 --> 15:45.626
And then
I encouraged you to try.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.094
I'll be in the control room

15:47.129 --> 15:49.263
watching your family
kill each other.

15:50.298 --> 15:52.133
Klaus, we have to do something.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.868
They're all gonna
kill each other.

15:53.902 --> 15:56.070
Wait, what are all these fans?

15:57.439 --> 15:58.639
(gasps) Look.

16:00.008 --> 16:01.342
Hayley was right.

16:01.376 --> 16:03.777
This is how they send smells
out into the park

16:03.812 --> 16:05.346
to get you to buy things.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.047
(gasps) That's it.

16:07.082 --> 16:09.550
Hey, Roy, do you have cinnamon?

16:09.584 --> 16:11.352
I want to make some cookies.

Well done.

18:48.510 --> 18:49.576
What?

18:49.611 --> 18:51.845
You're why I built Familyland.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.614
I wanted a place where families

18:53.648 --> 18:55.816
would find their
way back together.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.818
You were broken, but, Francine,

18:57.852 --> 19:01.522
you showed me that the
Smith family is worthy.

19:01.556 --> 19:02.523
Wait, Smith.

19:02.557 --> 19:04.058
That's not Jewish, is it?

19:05.193 --> 19:08.395
Then yes, you are indeed
a worthy family.

19:08.430 --> 19:10.564
And, um, here.

19:10.598 --> 19:13.233
Here is your reward.

19:13.268 --> 19:14.902
Ooh, lifetime passes.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.203
It was worth it!

19:16.237 --> 19:18.172
It was all worth it!

19:19.207 --> 19:20.808
What will you do now?

19:20.842 --> 19:21.875
Leave your family.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.143
Come live with me forever.

19:23.178 --> 19:24.378
We'll get an apartment.

19:24.412 --> 19:26.013
What? No.

19:26.047 --> 19:28.015
Then I shall return
to my slumber,
