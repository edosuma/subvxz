00:46.463 --> 00:50.049
Two decades had passed
since the creation of both species.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.634
The war had begun.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.764
Viktor increased his army,
creating a legion of vampires...

00:56.931 --> 01:00.017
...to protect them
from the very first clan of werewolves:

01:00.185 --> 01:05.147
a vicious and infectious breed unable
to take human form ever again.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.233
Until he was born.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.825
Lucian.

01:21.122 --> 01:25.876
And although every fiber of Viktor's
soul warned him to slay this child...

01:26.836 --> 01:28.545
...he did not.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.679
Over the years, this child grew.

01:37.847 --> 01:42.184
He possessed a strength and focus
that the ones before him did not.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.711
What do you think, Sonja?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.631
Shall we make more?

02:12.799 --> 02:14.383
Of him?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.009
Like him.

02:16.719 --> 02:19.555
Lucian will always be
the first of the breed...

02:19.931 --> 02:22.057
...the first of the Lycans.

02:30.733 --> 02:34.111
Viktor would use Lucian's
infectious blood to his benefit...

02:34.279 --> 02:36.280
...taking advantage
of the child's thirst...

02:36.447 --> 02:39.366
...pitting it against him as he
was forced to feed on humans...

02:39.742 --> 02:41.743
...Viktor's slaves.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.582
-Get in there.
-In there.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.358
Instead, he created a new race
of immortals:

03:13.526 --> 03:14.651
Lycans.

03:14.819 --> 03:18.071
Werewolf, but also human.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.743
Unlike the others,
this new breed could be harnessed...

03:22.911 --> 03:26.538
...enslaved to guard them
in the daylight hours of their masters.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.333
Or so Viktor thought...

03:29.500 --> 03:31.126
...so very long ago.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.777
The nobles are upset, my Iord.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.321
WiIliam's pestilence
has not been checked.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.158
-Werewolves have killed their slaves.
-Humans upset.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.745
Tannis, please take a note
of what pain that brings me.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.665
Yet their Iost slaves
means our lost silver.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.251
Enough. Have I not
increased our holdings tenfold...

04:12.418 --> 04:14.336
...since Marcus and AmeIia
took their sleep?

04:14.504 --> 04:18.005
We wiIl deal with the wolves
as we aIways have.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.381
-Come on!
-Come on, quickly!

05:55.438 --> 05:57.022
Fire!

06:16.084 --> 06:17.751
Close that breach.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.768
Have you nothing better to do,
blacksmith...

06:34.936 --> 06:36.436
than play with weapons of war?

06:36.979 --> 06:38.814
At least make yourself useful.

06:39.148 --> 06:43.110
A little gratitude, Sonja,
to the one who saved your Iife.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.653
I needed no saving.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.030
Tell me, Lucian.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.659
Does it burden your heart
to kill your own kind?

06:50.827 --> 06:54.454
Not at all.
They're mindless beasts, my lord.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.832
-No brethren of mine.
-Really?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.626
Father.

07:07.677 --> 07:12.055
You are a credit to your race.
Do you know how to remain so?

07:12.223 --> 07:15.016
Keep your eyes on the ground.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.102
Get rid of that.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.525
You were sorely missed at council.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.862
There are other demands on my time,
as you know.

07:27.029 --> 07:30.365
I see. I hope you enjoyed
your littIe moonIit ride.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.700
I was out patrolling.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.245
You were disobeying.
I toId you to stay within these walls.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.581
You risk too much
for a father to ignore.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.125
You wiIl leave the wolves
to the Death Dealers.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.086
And why, Father,
is my risk any greater than theirs?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.629
They are not my daughters...

07:46.132 --> 07:49.134
...and they are not council members.
You are.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.471
And one day, you will become
an elder, your birthright.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.144
Sonja, you are well thought of
at council...

07:59.312 --> 08:00.896
...but that is a precarious thing.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.982
They grow tired
of your games and your absences.

08:04.859 --> 08:09.279
Dangers of the forest are no greater
than those of the council chamber.

08:09.989 --> 08:14.534
You wiIl learn the dance of politics,
to be ruthless and cunning.

08:14.702 --> 08:18.205
And above all,
you wiIl be Ioyal to your family.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.750
To me.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.171
After aIl,
without the loyalty between us...

08:26.339 --> 08:28.715
...we are no better
than the beasts at our door.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.787
Put your back into it.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.291
Pick that up.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.465
Move it, you scum.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.973
More spin.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.979
Get up.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.819
Lycan.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.988
No rest, dog.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.164
Enough.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.293
You dare raise your hand to me?

09:46.460 --> 09:49.754
-I said, that's enough.
-So says the master's dog?

09:49.922 --> 09:53.258
You wiIl not always be his favorite,
and when you fall...

09:53.509 --> 09:54.801
...l will be there.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.428
Let us hope so.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.182
What are you looking at?
Get back to work now!

10:01.350 --> 10:02.517
Get back to work!

10:04.186 --> 10:05.687
Back to work.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.156
The matter before the council
is simple.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.949
We are under attack.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.201
Six times in haIf as many weeks...

10:20.369 --> 10:22.579
...William's kind
have reached our very walls.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.207
What mayhem would foIlow
ifjust one of them got through?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.127
Your fear, Coloman, is misplaced.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.379
Are we not protected
by an army of immortals?

10:31.547 --> 10:32.714
Superbly, my lord.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.051
However, the nobles are not,
and as I have pointed out...

10:36.218 --> 10:38.094
...they are the grass
on which we graze.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.181
If we cannot protect our humans,
it makes us look weak.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.642
And how would you
project strength?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.977
As our Death Dealers
patrol the night...

10:46.145 --> 10:48.229
...so our daylight guards
can patrol the day.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.231
Lycans patrol outside the walls?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.233
Have you lost your mind?

10:52.401 --> 10:54.194
They are born of beasts...

10:54.403 --> 10:57.530
...and the savagery of this
despicable fact cannot be bred away.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.408
I think your fear of this idea
is misplaced.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.703
We can create
a privileged class of Lycans.

11:04.121 --> 11:09.334
Greater rations, finer quarters and put
them under the hand of one we trust.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.252
Perhaps your pet, Lucian.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.713
The one who saved
your daughter's life today.

11:13.881 --> 11:18.426
In fact, I think we shouId
hear her thoughts on this matter.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.265
She seems
to have been needed elsewhere.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.267
Find her.

11:29.438 --> 11:33.525
I wilI take your suggestion
under advisement.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.276
Thank you, my Iord.

11:35.444 --> 11:38.154
It would be gratifying
to be able to reassure the nobles...

11:38.322 --> 11:42.200
...when they arrive tomorrow
that we have their interests at heart.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.287
-Move it!
-Move it!

11:46.706 --> 11:49.207
Go on, slowpoke.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.959
Over there. There.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.838
-Move it!
-Don't go slow. Keep going.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.180
Move it along!

13:18.798 --> 13:20.507
My Iady?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.757
Is it true what you told my father...

14:44.925 --> 14:47.719
...that you feel nothing
when you kill them?

14:49.346 --> 14:51.389
They're just animaIs...

14:51.807 --> 14:54.517
...incapable of thought or feeIing...

14:55.603 --> 14:58.313
...so why should l feel anything
for them?

15:02.776 --> 15:07.822
Sonja, if l were to leave from here,
would you come with me?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.328
Leave?

15:15.289 --> 15:16.414
Do not say that.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.833
Do not even think it.
They would hunt you down...

15:19.001 --> 15:22.545
-...and mark you like aIl the others.
-Not if I could remove this.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.213
Look.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.341
I made it.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.177
This will be my freedom.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.515
Lucian, promise me
you won't use it.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.976
-Please.
-Is that your answer, then?

15:37.394 --> 15:39.270
You wiIl not come.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.856
So you want me
to stay here for you?

15:42.024 --> 15:45.735
-Like this, like an animaI?
-Lucian.

15:50.616 --> 15:55.453
Vampire and Lycan,
we are both children of Corvinus...

15:55.663 --> 15:57.497
...yet my family are slaves.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.667
I wilI use this key...

16:01.377 --> 16:03.378
...and I will leave this place...

16:06.840 --> 16:08.633
...but l can never be without you now.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.730
-Any news of my daughter?
-She's most defiant.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.066
She refuses to see me.

17:07.233 --> 17:10.611
-Will not answer her door.
-Why are the young so blind?

17:10.779 --> 17:13.948
She risks her seat on the council,
and for what?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.159
I cannot imagine.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.579
We must prepare, my lord.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.080
Human nobles are on their way.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.011
It's sharp.
No wolf will stand before it.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.515
Ready the horses.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.019
Let someone else go.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.356
-Why?
-Last night, after I Ieft you--

18:29.191 --> 18:30.650
Just let someone else go.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.194
In case it had escaped your notice,
blacksmith...

18:33.821 --> 18:36.864
...l am quite capable
of looking after myself.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.120
And besides...

18:44.081 --> 18:45.873
...you can watch over me
from the wall.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.216
Get your back to the rear.

18:56.885 --> 19:00.054
Lady Sonja, your father
has ordered you to stay behind.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.224
I intend to see our guests
safeIy through the gate.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.394
-Gate master.
-This is not a request.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.396
Your father is ruler of the coven.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.648
So he keeps reminding me.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.454
Get back!

19:28.667 --> 19:30.418
Careful, bIacksmith...

19:30.586 --> 19:33.129
...lest your eyes betray your secret.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.178
Steady. Steady.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.931
Shut it, my child. Shut it.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.854
Form up!

20:11.668 --> 20:12.710
No.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.962
Get your men out there now!

20:15.130 --> 20:17.673
Down, boy. Your leash is too tight.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.884
-Step away.
-There's too many of them.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.802
They'll be massacred.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.392
Stop him!

20:33.148 --> 20:34.982
Ride out. Ride out.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.668
Easy.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.419
Dimitri.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.320
Lucian!

22:17.210 --> 22:18.586
Sonja!

22:37.522 --> 22:39.440
Lucian, no.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.069
No, stop!

23:38.125 --> 23:39.834
He did it to save me.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.421
Am I not master of this house?

23:45.173 --> 23:47.675
You know you are forbidden
to remove your shackle.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.884
Yes.

23:49.052 --> 23:52.012
Yet you break my Iaw
after I gave you your life.

23:53.140 --> 23:57.101
Your days of plush living
are over, slave.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.562
Father, leave him be.

23:59.729 --> 24:02.356
-I told you--
-HoId your tongue!

24:02.524 --> 24:04.942
You have defied me
for the last time.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.695
Get her out of here.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.040
Burn the bodies.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.251
Burn them aIl.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.078
For removing the colIar...

24:58.246 --> 25:00.414
...30 lashes.

25:14.012 --> 25:17.223
You have stung me, Lycan,
with your betrayal.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.602
You were like a son to me.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.355
I gave you your life.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.774
You gave me chains.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.694
I would have thought, after all
these years, you would have known...

25:30.862 --> 25:34.365
...you cannot have one
without the other.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.410
Do it.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.922
I toId you l'd be there when you fell.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.075
-What?
-Stop this.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.911
-He is one of our protectors.
-They are but beasts.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.998
-This could stir up the others.
-Let them. Do you fear them?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.042
It will be worse
if we do not punish them.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.419
Do you see now, Coloman?
You would trust them...

27:10.587 --> 27:13.589
...outside the walls?
We cannot even trust them inside.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.675
By my count, that's 21 .

27:17.218 --> 27:19.053
Continue.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.223
Oh, what a terribIe sound.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.311
Bloody stink.

27:42.911 --> 27:47.414
Stay away from him,
or they'll punish you too.

28:02.263 --> 28:06.016
Your concern for Lucian
was most touching.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.227
A sIave.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.270
He had just saved my life.

28:10.772 --> 28:14.400
Was it not you who told me
to show a little gratitude?

28:14.984 --> 28:16.443
And yourself?

28:16.611 --> 28:18.737
Gratitude for the one
who saved your daughter?

28:18.905 --> 28:20.531
I am awash with it.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.283
That he lives shows the breadth
of my magnanimity.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.827
Were it other circumstances...

28:24.994 --> 28:29.289
...l would have had him fed
in pieces to his own kind.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.209
But his punishment is now over.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.380
-He will be freed.
-Freed?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.757
Your judgment is clouded, Sonja.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.634
We do not keep order
with sentiment.

28:40.802 --> 28:44.471
Lucian was forbidden to remove
his collar and yet he did so...

28:44.806 --> 28:47.599
...for however fine a reason.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.602
He will remain in prison...

28:51.646 --> 28:54.314
...a cautionary tale.

28:56.901 --> 29:00.487
Janosh and the other nobles
will soon arrive.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.699
Your presence is expected.

29:09.664 --> 29:12.166
I saw what you did out there.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.586
Very brave...

29:15.754 --> 29:17.588
...for a human.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.676
Have you come
across them before?

29:24.304 --> 29:25.679
Only in stories.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.432
Were you not afraid of them?

29:28.892 --> 29:30.184
Yes...

29:31.686 --> 29:33.187
...but l wanted to live.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.856
Are you afraid of me?

29:40.361 --> 29:43.947
-Yes.
-Well, do not be.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.867
I wilI not bite...

29:47.619 --> 29:49.286
...much.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.541
-You are like them?
-No.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.046
A Lycan, yes, but not like them.

29:59.422 --> 30:03.217
Those you fought with tonight
were animaIs, the spawn of William.

30:03.384 --> 30:07.054
Purebloods, if you will.
No trace of human Ieft.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.766
Savage, mindless beasts.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.520
-As it has been told.
-But I saw you.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.317
They obeyed you.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.487
Yes.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.574
Yes, they did.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.129
Hey.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.718
-Oh, you should not be here.
-I had to.

30:46.886 --> 30:47.928
My Iove, I'm sorry.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.347
-Your back.
-No, no, I'm all right.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.391
This is my fault. If
I had not gone out--

30:52.851 --> 30:54.893
Then you would not be who you are.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.105
This is not your fauIt.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.110
I cannot remain here.
I have to leave this place.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.070
My father will be watching you more.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.614
Your Death DeaIers,
are there none you can trust?

31:07.782 --> 31:11.159
Their loyalty to my father
is greater than their loyalty to me.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.786
Tannis.

31:13.621 --> 31:16.123
-Tannis cannot be trusted.
-No, he knows about us.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.377
-How?
-I have no idea.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.463
If he still has not told your father,
he wants something.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.216
Sonja, find out what it is.

31:52.785 --> 31:53.952
Bring them in.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.078
Janosh.

32:39.123 --> 32:43.210
Do you not own
the largest silver mine in these lands?

32:43.544 --> 32:45.879
It has been overrun, my lord.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.382
Our workers infected...

32:48.549 --> 32:49.591
...turned to beasts.

32:49.759 --> 32:50.884
Most unfortunate...

32:51.469 --> 32:53.220
...and costIy.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.014
I think half the rights to your mine...

32:56.182 --> 32:58.600
...should cover
the expense of our assistance.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.227
What assistance?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.938
We have alI seen
the fires on the way here.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.066
We have learned of the deaths
of Baron Covasha and his family.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.985
The wolves are at your door as well.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.821
So why should I pay tribute...

33:10.989 --> 33:13.907
...when you cannot
so much as protect your own house?

33:14.075 --> 33:17.202
You have alI but
bled me dry already.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.579
We have alI heard the stories.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.250
Look into his eyes. They are true.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.252
This place is cursed.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.921
They are no more human...

33:28.089 --> 33:30.257
...than the devils
that invade our lands.

33:30.925 --> 33:36.013
If devils you caIl us, rest assured,
better the devil you know.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.599
-Unhand me.
-Certainly.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.235
Would anyone else
like to be heard?

33:52.238 --> 33:55.115
-Toss it here.
-Bring food to these filthy mongreIs.

33:55.283 --> 33:58.201
-Here you go.
-Eat it up like dogs.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.215
Like dogs.

34:28.983 --> 34:31.650
We are not animals.

34:34.697 --> 34:38.492
Is this what you want, to be their
entertainment, their playthings?

34:38.951 --> 34:40.702
Their pets.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.496
Cowering beneath the whip...

34:43.664 --> 34:45.998
...and then fighting
amongst ourselves.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.585
Is this what you want?

34:53.341 --> 34:56.592
I have lived
by their rules my entire life.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.428
I've protected them...

34:58.888 --> 35:00.472
...envied them.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.224
And for what?

35:03.476 --> 35:05.811
To be treated like an animal.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.521
We are not animals!

35:09.524 --> 35:12.109
We do have a choice.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.946
We can choose
to be more than this.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.031
We can be slaves...

35:18.783 --> 35:21.701
...or we can be Lycans!

35:28.084 --> 35:31.044
Morning is upon us, my chiId.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.048
It's time we left
this wretched night behind.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.052
-Gladly.
-There are difficult decisions ahead.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.139
-I would like your help with one.
-Of course, Father.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.474
With Lucian gone...

35:45.143 --> 35:48.019
...we must promote
another Lycan in his place.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.730
Gone?

35:50.898 --> 35:53.316
Coloman thinks
he will stir the others.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.152
We must remove him.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.198
That will be difficult.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.078
He has been with us so long.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.629
Perhaps Gyorg.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.090
Or Thrasos.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.594
They would be...

36:21.637 --> 36:22.721
...trustworthy.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.432
Excellent suggestions.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.726
I wilI consider them strongly.

36:56.797 --> 37:02.469
You, my child, are the
most precious thing in my heart.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.993
What have you told my father?

37:27.620 --> 37:29.621
-What have you told him?
-Nothing.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.081
-Why?
-Why what?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.500
Why have you told him nothing?

37:34.460 --> 37:37.837
Would your father weIcome
the man who brought him news...

37:38.005 --> 37:40.799
...that his
beloved daughter was consorting...

37:41.425 --> 37:43.134
...with a Lycan?

37:47.723 --> 37:50.141
He isn't well known for his gratitude.

38:00.111 --> 38:04.948
And I am not yet in a position
to use this for my benefit.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.620
What sort of benefit?

38:13.374 --> 38:15.333
There are 1 2 council seats.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.086
And we don't die often.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.338
Sadly, no.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.507
So, what if I gave up my seat
at council?

38:22.675 --> 38:24.676
Simply left it to you?

38:25.052 --> 38:26.219
Why would you do that?

38:26.721 --> 38:28.888
Can you keep a secret?

38:32.643 --> 38:34.227
I wilI need something in return.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.753
Two minutes.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.880
Any longer is too risky.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.804
I'm sorry. There was no other way.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.394
So Tannis?

39:16.771 --> 39:20.148
You were right. He will help us
in exchange for a seat on the council.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.317
-Your father knows nothing?
-I'm sure of it.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.778
-Sonja, this can work.
-Lucian, it has to.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.237
Some will come with me.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.073
-Sabas and Xristo, Raze.
-My love--

39:28.240 --> 39:30.450
-I'm certain I can--
-Lucian, there is no time.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.787
Father will have you killed tomorrow,
after the humans are turned.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.331
You must leave at sunrise.

39:36.749 --> 39:40.043
-And you?
-The important thing is you stay alive.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.129
Best chance you have is when
Viktor and the Death Dealers sleep.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.215
I wilI be
at my father's side when you go.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.633
Hurry.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.719
If this works, I'll meet you
in three days, after sunset.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.597
There's a clearing by the river.
I'll meet you there.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.483
-And if it doesn't?
-I will meet you at the clearing.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.503
Face the waIl.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.173
-Get out.
-You animals.

40:28.342 --> 40:31.177
You. Get back.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.596
Be brave, human.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.188
You know what your problem is?

40:45.151 --> 40:47.444
You don't understand
the natural order of things.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.363
Things change.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.532
Be ready when they do.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.875
Consider it a parting gift.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.709
Wait.

41:48.088 --> 41:51.424
Do you not realize
this is a gift I am giving you?

41:51.592 --> 41:53.259
It's a curse.

42:04.355 --> 42:08.066
-What have they done to us?
-You'Il find out soon enough.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.443
They turned us into-- Like you?

42:11.111 --> 42:12.529
Yes.

42:12.696 --> 42:13.780
Why?

42:13.948 --> 42:16.491
He wants to use you
for his own protection.

42:16.659 --> 42:17.867
I wilI die first.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.912
Well, that may not happen.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.413
The time has come.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.874
At sunrise, l leave this place.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.794
Anyone willing
to take the risk may follow me.

42:32.299 --> 42:35.969
There is a new life waiting
beyond these walls, my friend...

42:36.136 --> 42:39.305
...and you can be a part of it,
one of us...

42:39.682 --> 42:41.641
...or stay and serve them.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.398
The guards are coming.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.488
New dogs today.
Let's see how they look.

42:55.823 --> 42:56.948
You've come too Iate.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.284
He's already gone.

43:32.526 --> 43:34.444
Are you with me?

44:08.395 --> 44:12.357
Sabas, Xristo, free the others.
The rest of you with me.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.031
Freedom is yours.

44:20.199 --> 44:21.991
Move!

44:26.372 --> 44:28.039
This way.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.125
Down here.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.444
All right, move. Run, run, run.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.699
Keep moving.

45:08.122 --> 45:09.872
Keep moving. Keep moving.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.292
Keep going. Move.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.311
Fire.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.258
Raze.

46:03.343 --> 46:04.802
There is nothing you can do.

46:07.347 --> 46:09.724
I wilI come back. l promise you.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.435
No!

46:14.980 --> 46:16.773
My Iord.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.697
My Iord, Lucian is escaping.

46:50.432 --> 46:52.475
Forest, go. Go!

47:10.118 --> 47:11.744
My Iord.

47:32.224 --> 47:35.142
Move here. Move it.

47:35.310 --> 47:37.228
-You, get in there.
-Move.

47:37.396 --> 47:40.481
-Are all these accounted for?
-Each and every one.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.191
Tannis.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.068
Come on. Move.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.904
Yes, my lord?

47:47.114 --> 47:48.781
Where is the key
I gave you for this?

47:49.825 --> 47:52.910
-I locked it in the armory myself.
-How, then, is it open?

47:54.246 --> 47:55.371
I have no idea.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.582
I think I have.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.293
-Kill him.
-No.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.253
Please.

48:02.963 --> 48:04.797
Check the armory.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.008
There has to be an explanation.

48:07.175 --> 48:09.135
Show me.

48:18.854 --> 48:22.148
-I've never been outside the walls.
-Enjoy it while you can, Xristo.

48:22.316 --> 48:25.067
Soon enough we're gonna
have to fight our way back in.

48:25.235 --> 48:28.571
We didn't all make it, and I won't
leave our brothers to rot back there.

48:28.739 --> 48:31.365
We humiliated Viktor.
It is they who will pay the cost.

48:31.533 --> 48:33.534
But we were lucky
to make it out alive.

48:33.702 --> 48:36.495
And there's but a handful of us.
We have no weapons.

48:36.663 --> 48:37.955
True, for now.

48:38.123 --> 48:40.833
The noble who brought you,
can you lead us to his estate?

48:41.001 --> 48:44.629
-Yes.
-Good. Come on. Come on.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.367
It has to be here.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.163
I put it here.

49:23.210 --> 49:24.710
Here.

49:27.714 --> 49:30.424
He must have made another one.

49:32.094 --> 49:34.512
I never doubted you.

49:42.229 --> 49:45.731
Now, I have no wish to remove
one shackle from around your necks...

49:45.899 --> 49:48.943
...only to repIace it
with one of my own.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.403
You have a choice.

49:50.570 --> 49:52.363
You can run and hide...

49:52.531 --> 49:53.990
...or you can stay and fight.

49:54.491 --> 49:57.410
Any man who fights with me
shall have his freedom...

49:58.161 --> 49:59.662
...and, if he wishes it...

50:01.039 --> 50:02.164
...immortality.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.879
Pick up your weapons.

50:13.593 --> 50:15.886
Together we're strong.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.558
There are other estates
to the west of here.

50:20.976 --> 50:23.060
I want you to go there.

50:23.228 --> 50:25.521
See how many will join us.

50:25.814 --> 50:28.482
I wilI meet you back here
in two days' time.

50:28.650 --> 50:30.735
-Put it over there.
-Over here.

52:46.746 --> 52:48.247
Father.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.374
Did I startle you? I'm sorry.

52:50.917 --> 52:52.376
No.

52:53.044 --> 52:54.587
You did not.

52:54.754 --> 52:56.922
It occurs to me...

52:57.090 --> 53:00.384
...that l have been thoughtless.

53:01.761 --> 53:05.931
So deep have I been in my own
anguish at Lucian's betrayal...

53:06.099 --> 53:08.184
...l gave no thought...

53:08.935 --> 53:11.145
...to your feelings.

53:12.063 --> 53:13.189
My feelings?

53:13.356 --> 53:15.816
They worm their way into our Iives...

53:15.984 --> 53:19.612
...and we forget the travesty
of their birth.

53:20.447 --> 53:23.199
I myself had tenderness
towards Lucian.

53:23.909 --> 53:25.951
He could have been anything.

53:26.119 --> 53:29.121
A Death Dealer, perhaps.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.956
Yes.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.418
Perhaps.

53:36.755 --> 53:39.340
But he was not as we are...

53:39.507 --> 53:41.175
...was he?

53:44.304 --> 53:46.513
Did you help him escape?

53:48.642 --> 53:50.392
Help him?

53:51.144 --> 53:52.770
Of course not.

53:55.148 --> 53:56.482
Are you lying to me?

53:58.693 --> 54:02.238
There are many things
that I have done against your wiIl...

54:02.405 --> 54:04.615
...but he is a Lycan.

54:08.119 --> 54:10.496
I'm sorry, my dear...

54:11.623 --> 54:13.165
...but you leave me no choice.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.261
Father, please--

54:26.513 --> 54:30.391
I wanted to believe your lies
though I knew it could not be true.

54:30.558 --> 54:32.476
Not my own daughter.
How could you?

54:32.936 --> 54:34.770
Father...

54:35.647 --> 54:37.523
...l love him.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.776
You have betrayed me!

54:41.861 --> 54:44.363
To be with an animal!

54:45.448 --> 54:49.576
I loved you more than anything!

54:50.120 --> 54:53.247
She does not leave this room!

55:11.057 --> 55:12.850
No. You're under orders to wait.

55:20.400 --> 55:21.692
Here.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.903
This rate, we'll have enough men
by the end of the week.

55:25.071 --> 55:28.574
-Has there been any sign of Sonja?
-Nothing.

55:31.619 --> 55:33.162
She shouId have been here by now.

55:33.330 --> 55:36.582
With respect, Lucian, l do not see
the wisdom in waiting for her.

55:36.750 --> 55:38.000
She's not one of us.

55:38.168 --> 55:41.086
Have you forgotten
she is the one who set us free?

55:41.254 --> 55:43.380
But she is a vampire.

55:43.548 --> 55:46.467
If she has deceived you,
she could lead them here.

55:46.926 --> 55:49.219
Death Dealers
will undoubtedly be on the hunt...

55:49.387 --> 55:54.016
...and they will eventually find us,
but not by her doing.

55:58.730 --> 56:02.483
I trust Sonja with my life, and as Iong
as l'm in command, so shaIl you.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.280
Told you not to say anything.

56:11.618 --> 56:14.828
Lucian has sacked two estates
in Brashov, my lord, and made off...

56:14.996 --> 56:18.624
...with the contents of their armories.
The slaves have joined his ranks.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.251
Freedom is as much a disease
as William's pestilence.

56:21.419 --> 56:23.879
-You need to bring your pet back.
-Thank you, CoIoman.

56:24.047 --> 56:25.714
The obvious escaped me.

56:25.882 --> 56:32.137
I do not need to lift a finger.
Lucian will return of his own free wiIl.

56:33.306 --> 56:36.392
I have something he wants.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.311
My Iady.

56:50.657 --> 56:55.119
-Luka. What is it? Where is she?
-Sonja has been arrested.

56:55.412 --> 56:58.872
He knows about the two of you.

56:59.457 --> 57:00.666
He will kill her.

57:01.626 --> 57:03.752
I thought you should know.

57:23.523 --> 57:24.982
Nothing yet, my lord.

57:28.987 --> 57:32.030
-It is a trap. You know that.
-I will not let her die aIone.

57:32.198 --> 57:34.783
They followed you here.
If you go, we will lose them.

57:34.951 --> 57:37.536
Let me tell you a secret.
They thought they followed me.

57:37.704 --> 57:41.248
What they followed is the idea of being
free. That's what brought them here.

57:41.416 --> 57:45.711
Now, you can hold them together until
I get back, and lead them if l do not.

59:43.162 --> 59:45.664
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.833
But Lucian, you were free.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.835
Not without you.

59:50.295 --> 59:52.504
We have to go now.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.499
My Iord...

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.336
...your daughter has escaped.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.380
Of course she has.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:01:01.073
This way.

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:11.249
-That one.
-Yes, sir.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.037
Now.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.834
How dare you
raise your hand to me?

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:39.129
-I do not want this.
-I am your father.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:55.353
-Do you think you can defeat me?
-I don't want to defeat you.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.203
Killing me
won't save your precious Lycan.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.623
Please call off your men,
for the sake of your grandchild.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.798
A miracle, Father.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:26.051
A union of the bloodlines.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.516
I curse the day your mother gave
her Iife to bring you into this world.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:35.268
That thing inside you...

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.813
...is a monstrosity.

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.651
Sonja!

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:44.569
This is over.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.738
Remove him.

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.698
Do you understand
what you have done?

01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:50.992
This night was not about you.
It was about him.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:53.495
I could have given Lucian
to the council.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.998
They need never have known
of your indiscretion, but after this...

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.667
...never.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.920
No.

01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:16.101
If l had not left,
none of this would have happened.

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.771
Then you would not be who you are.

01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:22.774
You were right.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.360
No one should live a life Iike this.

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:29.531
Others are free because of you.

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:33.201
Things are forever changed
because of what you have done.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.370
-But I have failed you.
-No.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.206
Lucian, my love...

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.126
...you have not failed me.

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:45.755
The choices I made
have led me here.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:47.799
Not you.

01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:53.054
You said yourself there are risks
that you were willing to take for me...

01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:56.308
...as was l for you.

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.310
For us.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:01.813
Open the door.

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:05.483
-No.
-Get up.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.652
-No. No.
-Come on. Come on.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:10.030
No. I'll kill you.

01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:12.073
All of you!

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:40.268
The accused has committed
high treason against the coven.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.814
She has consorted with animals.
She has abetted in their escape.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:49.194
I have saved this coven
many times over.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:50.862
You have killed your own kind.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.823
And you've commingled
bloodlines...

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:57.202
...resuIting in the thing
germinating within you.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:01.957
Your past gIory does not excuse
your present guilt...

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:05.210
...nor does your station
as a council member.

01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:09.881
The punishment for these crimes
is death.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:11.633
How vote you?

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.725
Aye.

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:25.188
-Aye.
-Aye.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.985
She's your daughter.

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:42.247
Aye.

01:06:42.623 --> 01:06:44.582
Take her to the chamber.

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:46.876
No, you-- You cannot do this.

01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:48.586
My Iady, come with us.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:51.589
-Come quietly, pIease.
-Viktor.

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:54.009
Viktor. No!

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.136
No, Viktor!

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.480
No.

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.203
Lucian.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:14.189
No, Sonja.

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:15.733
Don't. Just look at me.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:17.234
Keep your eyes on me, Sonja.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.403
Look at me!

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.413
I love you.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.710
As I love you.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:42.468
Your face will not be here
when this is over, wiIl it?

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.435
Goodbye, my love.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.148
No.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:10.205
No!

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:16.544
Sonja!

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:52.890
-Fetch my knives.
-Yes, my Iord.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.610
My Iord.

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:25.353
Go. Go. Quickly. Go.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:01.305
Now go free the others. Go!

01:16:10.148 --> 01:16:11.232
Follow me.

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:18.531
-Do you want your revenge?
-Yeah.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.992
It is out there. Now go.

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:48.477
We have greater concerns
than your precious scrolls.

01:16:48.645 --> 01:16:50.271
Go to the elders, now!

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:23.721
Kill the dogs!

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.057
Viktor.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.642
You defiled my daughter.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.477
-I loved her!
-You killed her!

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:09.053
I should have crushed you
under my heel the day you were born.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.347
Yes, you should have...

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:18.896
...but you didn't.

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.865
Lucian!

01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:26.463
Lucian.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.966
It is finished.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.220
No.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.557
This is just the beginning.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:38.994
But let me tell you a little something
about your beloved dark father.

01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:44.375
He's the one who killed your family.
Not the Lycans.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.211
But when he got to you...

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:51.298
...he just couldn't bear the thought
of draining you dry.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:56.845
You, who reminded him so much
of his precious Sonja...

01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:01.475
...the daughter
he condemned to death.

01:23:02.602 --> 23:59:59.999
Lies.
