14:58.890 --> 15:02.260
<b>But only one shop</b>
<b>will earn $200,000</b>

15:02.293 --> 15:05.563
<b>and the first-ever title</b>
<b>of Master Shop.</b>

15:05.630 --> 15:06.931
<b>- Yes.</b>

15:06.965 --> 15:09.534
<b>- This week,</b>
<b>we're judging cohesion.</b>

15:09.601 --> 15:14.139
<b>Today, you must tattoo</b>
<b>an Asian deity.</b>

15:16.074 --> 15:17.575
<b>- I hate Asian day.</b>

15:17.642 --> 15:19.377
<b> <i>This is Nunez's big thing.</i> </b>

15:19.444 --> 15:21.279
<b>He comes in with</b>
<b>this big gleam in his eye.</b>

15:21.313 --> 15:22.881
<b> <i>You sit there the whole day,</i> </b>

15:22.947 --> 15:25.750
<b>clenched up, thinking Nunez</b>
<b>is gonna come rip your ass.</b>

15:25.817 --> 15:28.653
<b>- Deities hold tremendous</b>
<b>cultural significance.</b>

15:28.720 --> 15:31.089
<b>Not only do these images</b>
<b>have strict symbolism</b>

15:31.156 --> 15:33.058
<b>attached to each element,</b>

15:33.124 --> 15:36.394
<b>they feature complex</b>
<b>backgrounds and tiny details.</b>

15:36.461 --> 15:39.764
<b>You'll need cohesion to make all</b>
<b>of these parts work together,</b>

15:39.831 --> 15:43.435
<b>or your tattoo</b>
<b>will be a chaotic mess.</b>

15:43.501 --> 15:44.636
<b> <i>- One of the biggest problems</i> </b>

15:44.669 --> 15:46.471
<b>with doing anything</b>
<b>Asian-inspired</b>

15:46.504 --> 15:47.839
<b> <i>is that they are very strict</i> </b>

15:47.906 --> 15:49.407
<b> <i>with their rules</i> </b>
<b> <i>and guidelines.</i> </b>

15:49.474 --> 15:51.443
<b>If we make any mistake, we</b>
<b>could be sending ourselves home.</b>

15:51.509 --> 15:55.013
<b>- For this tattoo,</b>
<b>you'll be tag-teaming.</b>

15:55.113 --> 15:58.483
<b>Your shop will create one</b>
<b>tattoo on the same canvas.</b>

15:58.516 --> 16:00.185
<b>Only one of you can tattoo</b>
<b>at a time,</b>

16:00.285 --> 16:02.354
<b>and you'll switch artists</b>
<b>every hour.</b>

16:02.454 --> 16:05.790
<b>And as always,</b>
<b>after every elimination tattoo,</b>

16:05.857 --> 16:08.326
<b>all of you will form</b>
<b>the jury of peers.</b>

16:08.360 --> 16:12.030
<b>You'll deliberate and put</b>
<b>one shop up for elimination.</b>

16:13.531 --> 16:16.201
<b>- I'm looking for you guys</b>
<b>to create perfectly done,</b>

16:16.301 --> 16:19.170
<b>really strong imagery</b>
<b>of what the deity is.</b>

16:19.204 --> 16:21.006
<b>I want that representation.</b>

16:21.039 --> 16:24.042
<b>You guys all have to out-think</b>
<b>each other on the drawing.</b>

16:24.142 --> 16:25.510
<b>Because today, it's gonna</b>
<b>come down to who puts</b>

16:25.543 --> 16:27.212
<b>this together the best on paper.</b>

16:27.312 --> 16:31.049
<b>Don't put what's not there,</b>
<b>but make what's there perfect.</b>

16:31.149 --> 16:34.819
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

16:34.886 --> 16:38.289
<b>Golden Skull Tattoo, your shop</b>
<b>won the last flash challenge.</b>

16:38.356 --> 16:41.192
<b>That means you have the power</b>
<b>to assign the canvases.</b>

16:41.226 --> 16:44.129
<b>It's getting down to the wire,</b>
<b>so every choice counts.</b>

16:44.195 --> 16:45.563
<b>- All right.</b>

16:45.630 --> 16:46.898
<b> <i>I do not specialize</i> </b>
<b> <i>in Asian tattooing.</i> </b>

16:46.998 --> 16:48.800
<b>I don't even know</b>
<b>what a deity is, man.</b>

16:48.867 --> 16:50.168
<b>Tell us what you want to get.</b>

16:50.235 --> 16:51.536
<b>- I'd like to get Hachiman,</b>
<b>the God of War.</b>

16:51.569 --> 16:52.904
<b>He's usually depicted</b>
<b>as a samurai.</b>

16:53.004 --> 16:54.339
<b>In black and gray on my shin.</b>

16:54.406 --> 16:55.907
<b>- Very cool.</b>

16:55.974 --> 16:57.142
<b>- We're gonna make sure</b>
<b>that we get the easiest canvas.</b>

16:57.208 --> 16:59.411
<b>And everybody else</b>
<b>can kiss my ass.</b>

16:59.511 --> 17:01.079
<b>- I'm getting Bishamonten.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

17:01.179 --> 17:04.316
<b>- One of the Seven Lucky Gods,</b>
<b>on my right calf.</b>

17:05.750 --> 17:06.885
<b>- You know what it is?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

17:06.917 --> 17:07.886
<b>- Neither do I.</b>

17:07.919 --> 17:09.220
<b>- Amaterasu.</b>

17:09.253 --> 17:11.323
<b>She's the Goddess of the Sun</b>
<b>and Universe,</b>

17:11.388 --> 17:12.490
<b>in black and gray,</b>

17:12.557 --> 17:13.992
<b>standing in front</b>
<b>of the rising sun.</b>

17:15.060 --> 17:16.728
<b> <i>- This totally sucks.</i> </b>

17:16.761 --> 17:18.262
<b>Usually, I hate Japanese day,</b>

17:18.329 --> 17:19.897

17:19.931 --> 17:21.933
<b> <i>I can't even say these</i> </b>

17:23.935 --> 17:28.006
<b>- A bold, colorful Hotei,</b>
<b>who's the happy Buddha.</b>

17:29.941 --> 17:31.176
<b>- First three are color,</b>

17:31.242 --> 17:32.777
<b>and then the second two</b>
<b>are black and gray.</b>

17:32.877 --> 17:34.412
<b> <i>- Hopefully Cleen's strategy</i> </b>
<b> <i>for the skull pick</i> </b>

17:34.446 --> 17:36.081
<b> <i>is to keep us alive</i> </b>

17:36.114 --> 17:37.882
<b>so that me and him</b>

17:37.949 --> 17:39.217

17:39.284 --> 17:40.218

17:40.285 --> 17:41.720

17:42.954 --> 17:44.456

17:48.226 --> 17:51.396

<b>please read the artist's name</b>

17:51.463 --> 17:53.565
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

17:53.632 --> 17:55.934

17:55.967 --> 17:57.736
<b>- Black Cobra Tattoos.</b>

17:57.802 --> 18:00.772
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>

18:00.805 --> 18:02.307
<b>- Golden Skull Tattoo.</b>

18:02.407 --> 18:04.476
<b> <i>- There's only one</i> </b>

18:04.542 --> 18:05.810
<b> <i>and that's the Buddha.</i> </b>

18:05.910 --> 18:07.379
<b>Obviously the one</b>

18:07.445 --> 18:09.147
<b>- Basilica Tattoo.</b>

18:09.247 --> 18:11.549
<b>We got Ho-chi-booner-flanger.</b>

18:11.616 --> 18:13.051
<b>Whatever. I don't know</b>

18:13.118 --> 18:15.320
<b>This is gonna be an</b>
<b>absolute [bleep]show.</b>

18:15.387 --> 18:19.124
<b>- You'll have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo an Asian deity.</b>

18:19.157 --> 18:22.394
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one shop will be out.</b>

18:22.460 --> 18:23.495
<b>Good luck.</b>

18:24.663 --> 18:26.331

<b>I'm Katie.</b>

18:26.398 --> 18:27.799
<b> <i>- Today these artists</i> </b>
<b> <i>are gonna show us</i> </b>

18:27.832 --> 18:29.401
<b>their version of Asian deities.</b>

18:29.467 --> 18:31.503
<b>- For style,</b>
<b>traditional Japanese?</b>

18:31.569 --> 18:33.305
<b>- Yeah, I do want to</b>
<b>keep it traditional.</b>

18:33.338 --> 18:35.240
<b> <i>- The biggest challenge</i> </b>
<b> <i>doing these deities</i> </b>

18:35.307 --> 18:38.076
<b>is gonna be having the story</b>
<b>translate through the artwork.</b>

18:38.143 --> 18:40.178
<b>- It's simple. You know,</b>
<b>style-wise, it has to match.</b>

18:40.245 --> 18:41.813
<b>And you don't want</b>
<b>it to look cartoony.</b>

18:41.846 --> 18:43.848
<b> <i>- It is a tricky thing to</i> </b>
<b> <i>pull off if you don't know</i> </b>

18:43.948 --> 18:45.984
<b>what you're doing, or you</b>
<b>don't have the right reference.</b>

18:46.017 --> 18:47.686
<b>- Give us a description.</b>
<b>What is this guy?</b>

18:47.786 --> 18:49.688
<b>- He's Hachiman, the God of War.</b>

18:49.788 --> 18:51.489
<b>He's usually depicted</b>
<b>as a samurai.</b>

18:51.523 --> 18:53.925

18:53.992 --> 18:55.493
<b>like, the armor work</b>
<b>and stuff, you know?</b>

18:55.527 --> 18:58.029
<b>- As far as, like, the texturing</b>
<b>of the metal and everything.</b>

18:58.129 --> 18:59.464
<b>- No, no, no, no, no, bro.</b>

18:59.531 --> 19:01.599
<b>There's no texturing</b>
<b>in traditional Japanese.</b>

19:01.666 --> 19:02.934
<b>We've got to keep</b>
<b>it traditional.</b>

19:03.001 --> 19:04.369

19:04.436 --> 19:05.837

19:05.870 --> 19:07.639
<b>And I'm not sure if</b>
<b>that's the right way to go.</b>

19:07.706 --> 19:10.342
<b>- And I think it's super smart</b>
<b>if we just do the mask</b>

19:10.375 --> 19:12.043
<b>with the blossoms.</b>
<b>I think that'll look rad.</b>

19:12.143 --> 19:13.478
<b> <i>- This late in the game,</i> </b>

19:13.545 --> 19:15.180

19:15.213 --> 19:17.882
<b>We came out here to</b>
<b>compete with the best.</b>

19:17.983 --> 19:19.951
<b>- Tell us again what your</b>
<b>idea is.</b>

19:20.018 --> 19:22.320
<b>- She's a Goddess of the Sun</b>
<b>and the Universe.</b>

19:22.387 --> 19:24.522
<b>I have to connect to</b>
<b>this goddess, and I want</b>

19:24.556 --> 19:26.858
<b>her to represent purity.</b>

19:26.891 --> 19:29.194
<b>Have the sun rising behind her,</b>

19:29.227 --> 19:30.495
<b>some kind of earth element.</b>

19:30.562 --> 19:33.064
<b>I'm thinking possibly</b>
<b>water beneath,</b>

19:33.131 --> 19:34.332
<b>so you see the reflection.</b>

19:34.399 --> 19:36.468
<b>And I'm loving</b>
<b>the whole tree thing.</b>

19:36.534 --> 19:39.571

19:39.671 --> 19:42.474
<b> <i>She's got, like, trees; she's</i> </b>
<b> <i>got a sun behind her face.</i> </b>

19:42.540 --> 19:44.075
<b>Some rocks or something.</b>

19:44.142 --> 19:46.344
<b>We can definitely take your</b>

19:46.411 --> 19:47.746
<b>as far as subject matter,</b>

19:47.846 --> 19:49.748
<b>and then translate it</b>

19:49.848 --> 19:51.316
<b>- Like the elements, yeah.</b>

19:51.383 --> 19:52.751
<b>It's gonna be</b>

19:52.851 --> 19:55.086

37:21.315 --> 37:22.883

37:45.739 --> 37:47.708

<b>You had to do a deity.</b>

37:47.741 --> 37:49.743

<b>A mask is not a deity.</b>
