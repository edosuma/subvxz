02:16.870 --> 02:20.581
Even if you accept the belief that the
high Trendex means a rising sales curve...

02:20.748 --> 02:22.040
- Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.668
- Say hello to the missus.
- We're not talking.

02:24.836 --> 02:26.545
My recommendation is still the same.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.756
Spread the good word
in as many small-time segments as we can.

02:29.924 --> 02:33.886
Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

02:34.053 --> 02:36.221
Why don't we colonize
at the Colony next week?

02:36.389 --> 02:39.016
Let me hear from you, Sam.
Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera.

02:39.184 --> 02:40.642
You better walk me to the Plaza.

02:40.810 --> 02:43.729
I didn't put a coat on.
- Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

02:44.439 --> 02:45.647
- Next?
- Gretchen Sabinson.

02:45.815 --> 02:49.151
Oh, yes. Send her a box of candy
from Blum's, $10. You know the kind.

02:49.319 --> 02:51.653
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll like that.

02:51.821 --> 02:53.280
She'll think she's eating money.

02:53.448 --> 02:56.116
Just say to her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours... "

02:56.284 --> 02:58.160
- You sent that one last time.
- I did?

02:58.328 --> 03:02.372
Well, put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts. "

03:02.540 --> 03:04.625
- I know.
- Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill?

03:04.792 --> 03:06.835
- For two blocks?
- You're late and I'm tired.

03:07.003 --> 03:09.546
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

03:09.714 --> 03:11.173
Here. Taxi.

03:11.799 --> 03:14.301
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

03:14.469 --> 03:15.928
- Well, no.
Thank you very much.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.137
Perfectly all right.

03:17.972 --> 03:21.183
- First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
- Poor man.

03:21.351 --> 03:23.435
Oh, come, come, come.
I made him a happy man.

03:23.603 --> 03:27.814
- I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
- He knew you were lying.

03:27.982 --> 03:31.151
Ah, in the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

03:31.319 --> 03:35.280
There's only the expedient exaggeration.
You ought to know that.

03:35.448 --> 03:38.283
- Say, do I look heavyish to you?
- What?

03:38.451 --> 03:39.868
I feel heavyish.

03:40.036 --> 03:42.537
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin. "

03:42.705 --> 03:44.498
"Think thin. "

03:44.666 --> 03:47.584
- Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
- Okay.

03:48.336 --> 03:50.462
Oh. Soon as you get back,
call my mother.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.173
Remind her we've got those theater tickets
for tonight.

03:53.341 --> 03:55.092
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

03:55.260 --> 03:59.179
I'll have had two martinis at the Oak Bar,
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

03:59.347 --> 04:02.182
- She doesn't do that.
- Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

04:02.350 --> 04:05.852
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first tomorrow,
the Skin Glow rehearsal at noon...

04:06.020 --> 04:08.021
...then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

04:08.189 --> 04:10.482
- Oh, yeah. Where was that?
- Larry and Arnold's, 1:00.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.609
- Oh.
- Will you check in later?

04:12.777 --> 04:13.819
Absolutely not.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.738
Here, driver, take this lady
back where she belongs.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.908
- Right.
- That ought to cover it.

04:20.785 --> 04:23.161
- Don't forget, call my mother right away.
- I won't.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.206
- Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night, sweetie.

04:28.876 --> 04:32.045
Oh, wait, Maggie. You can't call her.
She's at Mrs...

04:54.068 --> 04:55.402
- Good evening.
Good evening.

04:55.570 --> 04:57.988
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

04:58.156 --> 04:59.906
Yes, sir. Right this way.

05:01.159 --> 05:02.200
Herman.
- Roger.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.036
- I'm a little late.
- Roger Thornhill.

05:04.203 --> 05:05.662
- Fanning Nelson.
- How do you do?

05:05.830 --> 05:07.372
- How do you do?
- Larry Wade.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.584
- We got a little head start here.
- Oh, that won't last long.

05:10.752 --> 05:15.255
I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be
slow on starting but there's nobody faster.

05:15.423 --> 05:18.842
- What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
- I just did something stupid.

05:19.010 --> 05:22.596
I told my secretary to call Mother.
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

05:22.764 --> 05:25.724
Why not?
- She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.310
- Your secretary?
- No. My mother.

05:28.478 --> 05:31.521
One of those new apartments.
Wet paint and no telephone yet.

05:31.689 --> 05:33.940
George Kaplan.
- Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

05:34.108 --> 05:35.734
- Mr. George Kaplan?
Boy.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.326
- Kaplan.
- I've got to get off a wire immediately.

05:44.494 --> 05:46.787
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

05:46.954 --> 05:49.456
Oh, I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me.

05:49.624 --> 05:52.459
- Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?
- Go right ahead.

05:55.963 --> 05:57.839
- Right through there, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.674
Thank you, sir.

06:01.636 --> 06:03.136
Wait, what's that supposed to be?

06:03.304 --> 06:06.765
The car's waiting outside.
You will walk between us saying nothing.

06:06.933 --> 06:09.101
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.

06:09.268 --> 06:12.312
Let's go where? Who...? Who are you?

06:12.480 --> 06:14.564
Mere errand boys
carrying concealed weapons.

06:14.732 --> 06:18.693
His is pointed at your heart. So, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

06:18.861 --> 06:20.654
What is this, a joke or something?

06:20.822 --> 06:24.157
- Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car.
- Come.

06:24.325 --> 06:25.826
But this is ridiculous.

06:46.931 --> 06:49.975
Don't tell me where we're going,
surprise me.

06:51.853 --> 06:54.521
You know, I left some friends back there
in the Oak Bar.

06:54.689 --> 06:56.565
They're going to think I'm awfully rude.

06:56.732 --> 06:59.526
I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

06:59.694 --> 07:03.947
...so that I could explain
I'm being, uh, kidnapped?

07:04.115 --> 07:06.700
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.419
Locked.

07:30.057 --> 07:32.058
Who's Townsend?

07:33.769 --> 07:35.353
Really?

07:35.521 --> 07:37.230
Interesting.

08:21.442 --> 08:23.193
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, dressing.

08:23.361 --> 08:25.779
- Tell him I'm here.
- The dinner guests are expected.

08:25.947 --> 08:27.989
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan. "

08:28.157 --> 08:30.408
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

08:30.576 --> 08:32.159
- Is anyone in the library?
- No.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.787
This way.

08:44.966 --> 08:46.132
You will wait here.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.219
Well, don't hurry.
I'll catch up on my reading.

09:31.929 --> 09:32.971
Good evening.

09:56.537 --> 09:59.581
Not what I expected. A little taller.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.375
A little more polished than the others.

10:03.252 --> 10:06.212
Oh, I'm so glad you're pleased,
Mr. Townsend.

10:06.380 --> 10:09.716
But I'm afraid just as obvious.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.178
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

10:15.389 --> 10:17.891
Games? Must we?

10:19.143 --> 10:20.894
Not that I mind a case of abduction...

10:21.062 --> 10:23.688
...but I have tickets
for the theater this evening.

10:23.856 --> 10:28.401
To a show I was looking forward to. And I
get unreasonable about things like that.

10:28.569 --> 10:32.530
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.

10:33.658 --> 10:37.160
Oh, Leonard,
have you met our distinguished guest?

10:38.746 --> 10:40.538
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

10:41.082 --> 10:44.584
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

10:44.752 --> 10:48.838
- Elusiveness, however misguided...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

10:49.006 --> 10:51.966
- Did you call me "Kaplan"?
- I know you're a man of many names...

10:52.134 --> 10:54.844
...but I'm perfectly willing to accept
your current choice.

10:55.012 --> 10:56.179
Current choice?

10:56.347 --> 10:59.641
My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

10:59.809 --> 11:01.351
Of course.

11:01.936 --> 11:05.730
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.774
Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.361
I told you, I'm not Kaplan,
whoever he is. I'm...

11:11.529 --> 11:13.071
- Excuse me.
Yes?

11:13.239 --> 11:14.447
The guests are here, dear.

11:14.615 --> 11:17.784
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.621
Now, shall we get down to business?

11:21.789 --> 11:22.956
I'm all for that.

11:23.124 --> 11:26.459
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

11:26.627 --> 11:28.753
...and how you've come by
this information.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.464
- I don't expect to get this for nothing.
- Of course not.

11:31.632 --> 11:35.093
Don't misunderstand, I don't expect you
to fall in with this suggestion...

11:35.261 --> 11:39.764
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

11:42.977 --> 11:44.936
What the devil is that supposed to mean?

11:45.104 --> 11:47.731
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

11:47.898 --> 11:50.734
I've already told you...
- We know where you're headed for.

11:50.901 --> 11:51.985
I know where I'm headed.

11:52.153 --> 11:56.489
I'm headed for the Winter Garden Theater in
New York, and I think I'd better get going.

12:04.999 --> 12:07.125
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

12:07.543 --> 12:11.337
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

12:11.505 --> 12:14.507
I'm not Kaplan.
- I do wish you'd reconsider.

12:14.675 --> 12:19.262
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

12:19.430 --> 12:22.682
What contact?
I've never even been in Pittsburgh.

12:23.350 --> 12:26.686
On June the 16th, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

12:26.854 --> 12:29.814
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.859
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

12:33.027 --> 12:34.778
...as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

12:34.945 --> 12:37.363
On August 11th,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

12:37.531 --> 12:41.201
August the 29th, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

12:41.368 --> 12:43.536
At present, you are registered
in room 796...

12:43.704 --> 12:46.790
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

12:46.957 --> 12:48.041
- Really?
- In two days...

12:48.209 --> 12:51.461
...you are due at the Ambassador East
in Chicago.

12:51.629 --> 12:55.298
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

12:55.466 --> 12:57.383
- Not me.
- There's very little sense...

12:57.551 --> 13:01.387
...in maintaining that you're deceiving us
any more than we're deceiving you.

13:01.555 --> 13:04.557
I don't suppose it would do any good
to show you ID cards...

13:04.725 --> 13:08.812
...a driver's license, things like that?
- They provide you with such good ones.

13:09.730 --> 13:12.357
It's getting late. I have guests.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.944
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

13:16.111 --> 13:17.320
A simple no.

13:17.488 --> 13:21.407
For the simple reason I simply don't know
what you're talking about.

13:25.412 --> 13:27.455
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.

13:27.623 --> 13:29.332
A pleasant journey, sir.

13:40.636 --> 13:47.016
- Scotch? Rye? Bourbon? Vodka?
- Nothing. I'll take a quick ride back to town.

13:47.184 --> 13:48.935
Oh, that has been arranged.

13:49.103 --> 13:52.438
But first, a libation.

13:52.606 --> 13:53.690
Bourbon.

13:54.275 --> 13:57.193
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.

13:57.361 --> 14:02.532
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, it'll be necessary for us to insist.

14:15.963 --> 14:17.630
Cheers.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.097
Don't worry about me, fellas.
I'll take the bus.

18:00.020 --> 18:01.354
Thanks for the lift, fellas.

18:01.522 --> 18:04.232
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.

18:04.399 --> 18:05.691
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:05.859 --> 18:09.612
You see, they tried to kill me.
He won't listen to me.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.948
In a big house, they tried to kill me.

18:12.116 --> 18:15.243
- All right, let's just go inside.
- I don't wanna go inside.

18:15.410 --> 18:19.288
- Somebody call the police.
- Come on. Come on now.

18:19.456 --> 18:20.915
Okay.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.424
Sit down.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.718
I don't wanna sit.

18:33.262 --> 18:35.179
Perfectly all right. See?

18:35.347 --> 18:39.392
We'll get them. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.062
Assault with a gun, and a bourbon,
and a sports car. We'll get them.

18:43.230 --> 18:46.983
You'll be all right after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.

18:47.151 --> 18:51.863
- I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.
- The car was just reported stolen.

18:52.197 --> 18:55.366
- Uh-huh.
- A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.

18:55.534 --> 18:59.704
- I got to call someone. Where's the phone?
- You're allowed one call.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.456
- Over here.
- Oh, thanks.

19:02.624 --> 19:05.001
You better make it your lawyer.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.753
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

19:07.921 --> 19:09.922
What am I, a telephone operator?

19:10.090 --> 19:12.633
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

19:25.272 --> 19:27.607
Just a minute, please. Here.

19:27.774 --> 19:28.816
Thank you.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.945
Hello, Mother?

19:33.113 --> 19:36.866
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.

19:37.034 --> 19:38.242
Yeah.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.453
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

19:41.121 --> 19:44.832
- Where am I?
- Glen Cove Police Station.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.169
Glen Cove Police Station.

19:49.171 --> 19:51.631
No. No, Mother, I have not been drinking.

19:51.798 --> 19:57.345
No. No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.

19:57.888 --> 20:00.389
No, they didn't give me a chaser.

20:00.557 --> 20:01.599
No.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.392
Come on, let's go.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.980
- Wait, I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are. Come on.

20:08.148 --> 20:11.192
Mother, I gotta go now.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.903
Get my lawyer right away,
and come out and bail me out.

20:14.071 --> 20:16.155
Tomorrow morning, tell her.

20:16.323 --> 20:18.658
Tomorrow morning, he says.

20:19.409 --> 20:22.495
I don't know. I'll ask him.
She wants to know who says.

20:22.663 --> 20:24.664
Sergeant Emile Klinger.

20:24.831 --> 20:26.707
Sergeant Emile...

20:26.875 --> 20:28.501
Emile?

20:29.503 --> 20:32.338
Sergeant Emile Klinger.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.091
No, I didn't believe it either.

20:35.884 --> 20:40.179
Uh, I'm all right, Mother. Good night.
Good night, dear.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.185
That was Mother.

20:46.603 --> 20:48.312
Let's go.

20:54.444 --> 20:56.570
Here's your man, doctor.

20:59.533 --> 21:02.326
- What's your name?
- Roger Thornhill.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.412
Stick out your tongue and say "ah. "

21:04.579 --> 21:06.038
You better move back.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.999
Ah...

21:08.166 --> 21:09.625
Have you been drinking?

21:09.793 --> 21:12.295
Doctor, I am gassed.

21:12.462 --> 21:13.713
What were you drinking?

21:13.880 --> 21:16.090
Well, bourbon.
See, these two fellas, they...

21:16.258 --> 21:18.843
- How much would you say you drank?
- What did you say?

21:19.011 --> 21:22.555
- How much would you say that you drank?
- About this much.

21:22.723 --> 21:26.225
Mr. Thornhill, it is my opinion
that you are definitely intoxicated.

21:26.393 --> 21:27.435
No question about it.

21:27.602 --> 21:29.895
I am now gonna ask your permission
to draw blood.

21:30.063 --> 21:31.063
How disgusting.

21:31.231 --> 21:33.649
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made...

21:33.817 --> 21:35.943
...but if you do,
your license will be revoked.

21:36.111 --> 21:38.404
You have the right
to notify a physician of... "

21:38.572 --> 21:41.574
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...

21:41.742 --> 21:45.077
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...

21:45.245 --> 21:49.248
...he naturally had to drive as best he could
under the, uh, circumstances.

21:49.416 --> 21:52.084
Counselor,
how long have you known your client?

21:52.252 --> 21:53.377
Seven years, Your Honor.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.838
Do you know him
to be a reasonable man?

21:56.131 --> 21:58.174
Absolutely.
- Ha.

21:59.343 --> 22:00.760
- Mother.
And do you believe...

22:00.927 --> 22:03.721
...there is some credence to this story?

22:03.889 --> 22:05.431
- Credence?
- Well, yes, Your Honor.

22:05.599 --> 22:07.975
I mean, if my client says
this is what happened...

22:08.143 --> 22:10.728
...I'm certain it must've happened.
- You're damn right.

22:11.480 --> 22:15.399
Sergeant, I want this turned over
to the county detectives for investigation.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.943
Call them up
and have them come here immediately.

22:18.111 --> 22:19.779
- Right, Your Honor.
Counselor...

22:19.946 --> 22:22.448
...I'm going to set this over for final
disposition...

22:22.616 --> 22:24.367
...tomorrow night at 7:30.

22:24.534 --> 22:28.120
At which time I expect you and the
defendant to be here, ready to go to trial.

22:28.288 --> 22:32.458
In the meantime, the county detectives will
determine if his story has any basis in fact.

22:33.335 --> 22:36.796
"Basis in fact"? If I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe...

22:36.963 --> 22:38.089
Roger, wait a minute.

22:38.256 --> 22:41.050
I mean, after all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?

22:41.218 --> 22:45.805
That is precisely what
we're intending to find out, Mr. Thornhill.

23:03.156 --> 23:05.449
- Yes?
Remember me?

23:05.617 --> 23:06.867
- Yes, sir.
Good.

23:07.035 --> 23:10.413
- Is Mr. Townsend at home?
- No, I'm sorry he's left for the day, sir.

23:10.580 --> 23:12.456
Mrs. Townsend?

23:12.624 --> 23:15.501
- Who shall I say is calling?
- County detectives.

23:15.669 --> 23:17.420
Come in, please.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.306
This way, please.

23:39.109 --> 23:40.443
This is the room.

23:40.610 --> 23:42.611
- I'll call madam.
You do that.

23:42.779 --> 23:44.822
And here's the sofa
where they held me down.

23:44.990 --> 23:48.284
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.

23:50.954 --> 23:53.330
Well, they must've cleaned them off.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.791
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.

23:55.959 --> 23:58.252
Scotch, gin, vodka...

23:59.546 --> 24:01.380
And bourbon.

24:03.383 --> 24:06.177
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.

24:09.055 --> 24:13.684
Roger, dear,
we were so worried about you.

24:14.352 --> 24:17.313
Did you get home all right?
Of course you did.

24:17.481 --> 24:20.691
Let me look at you.
Oh, a little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?

24:20.859 --> 24:23.569
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.

24:23.737 --> 24:26.822
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.826
I'm Captain Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.

24:30.994 --> 24:33.746
- This is Lieutenant Harding.
- How do you do?

24:33.914 --> 24:36.332
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?

24:36.500 --> 24:38.918
- Stop calling me Roger.
- Has he gotten into trouble?

24:39.085 --> 24:43.506
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...

24:43.673 --> 24:46.175
...and incidentally, in a stolen car.
- Stolen car?

24:46.343 --> 24:48.761
Belonging to Mrs. Babson
of Twining Road.

24:48.929 --> 24:51.305
Roger, you said
you were going to call a cab.

24:51.473 --> 24:56.519
- You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?
- No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes.

24:56.686 --> 25:01.023
Mr. Thornhill told us that he was brought
to this house against his will last night...

25:01.191 --> 25:04.276
...and, uh, forcibly intoxicated
by some friends of your husband...

25:04.444 --> 25:05.861
...and set out on the road.

25:06.029 --> 25:08.614
- Do you know anything about this?
- Well, now, captain...

25:08.782 --> 25:11.700
...Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.

25:11.868 --> 25:12.910
She's lying.

25:13.078 --> 25:14.954
And I'm afraid he became even worse...

25:15.121 --> 25:16.288
...as the evening wore on.

25:16.456 --> 25:19.583
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.211
Oh, I knew
I should've served dinner earlier.

25:22.379 --> 25:23.921
What a performance.

25:24.089 --> 25:27.550
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?

25:27.717 --> 25:28.926
George Kaplan?

25:30.011 --> 25:31.762
- No.
- I didn't think so.

25:32.514 --> 25:35.391
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.

25:35.559 --> 25:39.311
- Is there any place he can be reached?
- Why, yes. The United Nations.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.272
United Nat...?

25:41.439 --> 25:44.483
He's addressing
the General Assembly this afternoon.

25:46.152 --> 25:48.529
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.

25:48.697 --> 25:51.991
- Sorry we had to bother you.
- No bother at all.

25:54.786 --> 25:56.495
Now, wait a minute.

26:02.502 --> 26:05.004
Will you be wanting
to get in touch with my husband?

26:05.171 --> 26:07.381
No, Mrs. Townsend,
that won't be necessary.

26:07.549 --> 26:09.842
You mean you're not gonna
do any more about this?

26:10.010 --> 26:14.096
Roger. Pay the two dollars.

26:29.154 --> 26:30.195
Goodbye.

26:57.515 --> 27:01.101
- I don't see why you want me along.
- You lend a certain air of respectability.

27:01.269 --> 27:03.187
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.076
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.

27:17.243 --> 27:19.411
Well, here goes. Ahem.

27:19.829 --> 27:24.208
Hello, Operator. Have you got
a George Kaplan staying here?

27:25.085 --> 27:26.752
That's right.

27:26.920 --> 27:27.961
You have?

27:28.129 --> 27:30.297
Room 796?

27:30.465 --> 27:32.216
Ring it, will you please?

27:32.384 --> 27:33.425
You see?

27:33.593 --> 27:35.719
I see. I hope he clears up
this silly business.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.639
- You're ruining my whole day.
- Shh, shh. All right. Quiet. Shut up.

27:39.557 --> 27:43.018
Oh. Well, did he leave word
when he'd be back?

27:43.603 --> 27:45.145
Really?

27:45.313 --> 27:47.147
Thank you.

27:47.315 --> 27:50.401
Well, that's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.

27:50.568 --> 27:52.403
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.613
Mother, do me a favor, will you?

27:54.781 --> 27:58.742
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.

27:58.910 --> 28:01.120
Don't be ridiculous.
I wouldn't do such a thing.

28:01.287 --> 28:03.539
- Ten dollars?
- Not for all the money in the world.

28:03.707 --> 28:06.834
- Fifty?
- Roger, you are disgraceful.

28:10.588 --> 28:15.092
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.635
And now, housebreaking.

28:16.803 --> 28:18.929
You're hotel-breaking.
There's a difference.

28:19.097 --> 28:21.598
- Of five to ten years.
Just a minute, please.

28:24.144 --> 28:26.687
Will you want me
to be changing your bedding, sir?

28:26.855 --> 28:28.731
Yes. Well, but not right now.

28:28.898 --> 28:32.067
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...

28:32.235 --> 28:34.695
...and I was wondering
if I ought to go on changing the linens.

28:34.863 --> 28:38.574
- Oh. Thank you for your interest.
- You're welcome, sir.

28:38.742 --> 28:39.783
Come on, now.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.373
Now, she seemed to think I'm Kaplan.

28:46.541 --> 28:49.293
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.

28:59.345 --> 29:01.638
- Oh, well, look who's here.
- Who? Where?

29:01.806 --> 29:05.601
Our friend who's assembling
the General Assembly this afternoon.

29:05.769 --> 29:07.519
Roger, I think we should go.

29:07.687 --> 29:09.521
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

29:09.689 --> 29:13.317
- I'll be late for the bridge club.
- Good. You will lose less than usual.

29:26.456 --> 29:27.873
Ooh.

29:28.041 --> 29:31.543
- Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.
- In that case, I think we should leave.

29:33.046 --> 29:34.505
Too late.

29:39.719 --> 29:42.971
- You rang for me, sir?
- Yes. Come in a moment.

29:43.556 --> 29:46.850
- What's your name?
- Elsie, sir.

29:47.060 --> 29:51.396
- Elsie, do you know who I am?
- You're... You're Mr. Kaplan.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.733
Well, when did...?
When did you first see me?

29:54.901 --> 29:55.984
Outside the door.

29:56.653 --> 29:59.655
Out in the hall, a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?

29:59.823 --> 30:01.907
And that's the first time
you laid eyes on me?

30:02.075 --> 30:04.409
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?

30:04.577 --> 30:06.578
Well, then, how do you know
I am Mr. Kaplan?

30:06.746 --> 30:08.747
- What?
- How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

30:08.915 --> 30:12.334
Well, of course you are.
This is room 796, isn't it?

30:12.502 --> 30:16.296
So you're the gentleman in room 796,
aren't you?

30:16.464 --> 30:17.714
All right, Elsie, thanks.

30:17.882 --> 30:20.425
- Will that be all, sir?
- For the time being, yes.

30:26.558 --> 30:27.599
Valet.

30:27.767 --> 30:29.518
Oh, yes, come in.

30:30.061 --> 30:32.062
Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?

30:32.230 --> 30:33.772
Yes, please.

30:39.487 --> 30:40.988
Tell me, uh...

30:41.155 --> 30:43.782
I forgot,
what time did I give you that suit?

30:44.450 --> 30:46.034
Last night, around, uh...

30:46.202 --> 30:47.452
- Around 6.
- Oh.

30:47.620 --> 30:50.122
- Did I give it to you personally?
- Personally?

30:50.290 --> 30:53.500
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me...

30:53.668 --> 30:57.379
...and said it would be hanging
in your closet. Like you always do.

30:57.547 --> 31:00.257
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, just curious.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.467
- Here. Thanks.
- Thank you.

31:02.635 --> 31:04.428
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.809
Isn’t that the damnedest thing?

31:10.977 --> 31:14.354
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.

31:14.522 --> 31:17.274
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.817
Oh...

31:23.781 --> 31:25.449
Let me see something.

31:31.497 --> 31:34.333
I don't think that one does anything
for you.

31:39.505 --> 31:41.006
Ah, now, that's much better.

31:41.341 --> 31:43.592
Now, obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.

31:49.223 --> 31:51.516
- Should I?
- Certainly not.

31:53.144 --> 31:54.728
Here, hold that, dear.

31:57.941 --> 31:59.024
Hello.

31:59.192 --> 32:01.818
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.153
Who is this?

32:03.321 --> 32:06.448
We met only last night,
and still you do not recognize my voice.

32:06.616 --> 32:08.533
I should feel offended.

32:08.701 --> 32:11.912
Yes, I know who you are,
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.874
Of course not. You answer
his telephone, you live in his hotel room...

32:16.042 --> 32:18.043
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.

32:18.211 --> 32:21.713
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.

32:21.881 --> 32:23.340
Now, wait...

32:24.509 --> 32:26.510
- Hello, Operator? Operator.
Yes?

32:26.678 --> 32:30.222
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn...
Kaplan in 796.

32:30.390 --> 32:33.725
That call. Was that an outside call
or did it come from the lobby?

32:33.893 --> 32:36.353
Just a minute, sir. I'll see.
- Well, hurry, please.

32:36.521 --> 32:37.562
Who was it?

32:37.730 --> 32:39.856
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.

32:40.024 --> 32:42.359
- We're back to that one, are we?
- Hello? Operator?

32:42.527 --> 32:43.735
Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.

32:43.903 --> 32:45.988
That call was made from the lobby, sir.

32:46.155 --> 32:47.531
It was?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.741
They're probably
on their way up here now.

32:49.909 --> 32:53.620
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I think I'd like to meet these killers.

33:37.665 --> 33:40.959
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?

34:04.150 --> 34:06.485
Lobby, please. Watch your step.

34:07.278 --> 34:10.739
Oh, no, gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.

34:10.907 --> 34:12.824
That's right. Come along. Good.

34:12.992 --> 34:16.161
Roger. Roger, will you be home
for dinner?

34:20.123 --> 34:23.251
Where to?
- I don't know. Just keep going.

34:38.351 --> 34:40.976
- Take me to the United Nations.
Right.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.853
General Assembly Building.

34:43.022 --> 34:45.899
Right.
- I'm being followed. Can you do anything?

34:46.067 --> 34:47.692
- Yes, I can.
- Do it.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.644
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, please.

35:22.812 --> 35:27.274
- Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?
- Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?

35:27.441 --> 35:30.235
- Yes.
- And did you have an appointment, sir?

35:30.403 --> 35:32.195
Well, yes, yes. He expects me.

35:32.363 --> 35:33.822
Your name, please.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.116
- My name?
- Yes, please.

35:36.284 --> 35:38.577
Kaplan. George Kaplan.

35:40.204 --> 35:42.247
One moment, please.

35:47.795 --> 35:50.088
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.

35:57.263 --> 36:01.391
If you'll give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.

36:01.559 --> 36:04.728
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.

36:16.449 --> 36:20.118
Mr. Bernardi
of the Swiss Observers Office.

36:20.286 --> 36:23.955
Mr. Bernardi
of the Swiss Observers Office.

36:26.792 --> 36:28.919
Will you page
Mr. Lester Townsend, please?

36:29.086 --> 36:31.004
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.

36:31.172 --> 36:34.758
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

36:34.926 --> 36:38.887
Please call at the communications desk
of the public lounge.

36:39.055 --> 36:40.972
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

36:41.140 --> 36:44.392
Please call at the communications desk
of the public lounge.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.395
Miss Knox of salon...

36:47.563 --> 36:48.813
You paged me?

36:48.981 --> 36:50.315
- Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.

36:50.483 --> 36:52.275
- You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
- Yes.

36:52.443 --> 36:55.904
- This is Mr. Townsend.
- How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?

36:56.072 --> 36:59.991
- This isn't Mr. Townsend.
- Yes, it is.

37:00.159 --> 37:02.661
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?

37:02.828 --> 37:04.913
That's me. What can I do for you?

37:05.081 --> 37:08.458
Mr. Mauney, Delegation
of Pakistan. Please call the public lounge.

37:09.168 --> 37:11.336
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?

37:11.504 --> 37:14.506
That's right. Are we neighbors?

37:14.674 --> 37:17.592
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.636
That's the one.

37:20.137 --> 37:22.138
Were you at home last night,
Mr. Townsend?

37:22.306 --> 37:23.807
- You mean in Glen Cove?
- Yes.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.768
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.

37:26.936 --> 37:29.104
I always do when we're in session here.

37:29.272 --> 37:30.939
What about Mrs. Townsend?

37:31.440 --> 37:33.191
My wife has been dead for many years.

37:33.359 --> 37:36.152
- Oh, I...
- Now, Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.780
Forgive me. Who are those people living
in your house?

37:38.948 --> 37:41.491
What people?
The house is completely closed up.

37:42.243 --> 37:44.703
Just the gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

37:44.870 --> 37:47.956
Now, Mr. Kaplan, suppose you tell me
who you are and what you want.

37:48.124 --> 37:50.542
Well, please, just...

37:51.377 --> 37:54.004
Look. Do you know this man?

38:02.388 --> 38:04.055
Look!

38:08.185 --> 38:09.644
He's got a knife. Look out!

38:09.812 --> 38:12.605
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.

38:12.773 --> 38:15.233
Call the police.
- Wait a minute. Don't come nearer.

38:15.401 --> 38:17.068
Get back.

38:35.921 --> 38:38.923
"The photograph has been
identified as that of Roger Thornhill...

38:39.091 --> 38:43.845
...a Manhattan advertising executive,
indicating that the name of George Kaplan...

38:44.013 --> 38:48.975
...which he gave to an attendant in the
General Assembly Building was false.

38:49.143 --> 38:53.271
A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery...

38:53.439 --> 38:56.983
...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
at Glen Cove police court...

38:57.151 --> 39:01.154
...charged with drunk driving
with a stolen car.

39:01.322 --> 39:04.616
In his defense, he charged
that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...

39:04.784 --> 39:07.452
...had tried to kill him the night before. "

39:07.620 --> 39:10.830
- Brother.
- What about that?

39:11.123 --> 39:13.875
Does anyone know this Thornhill?

39:14.043 --> 39:16.795
- No, not me.
- Never heard of him.

39:16.962 --> 39:18.046
Professor?

39:18.214 --> 39:22.092
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.

39:22.259 --> 39:25.512
How can he get mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

39:25.679 --> 39:28.807
Don't ask me how it happened.
Obviously, it happened.

39:28.974 --> 39:32.894
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...

39:33.062 --> 39:34.771
...using Lester Townsend's house.

39:34.939 --> 39:39.484
The unsuspecting Mr. Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.

39:41.404 --> 39:43.988
So horribly sad.
How is it I feel like laughing?

39:44.156 --> 39:45.698
What are we going to do?

39:45.866 --> 39:46.991
Do?

39:47.159 --> 39:48.326
About Mr. Thornhill.

39:49.453 --> 39:51.037
We, uh...

39:51.205 --> 39:52.288
We do nothing.

39:53.082 --> 39:56.126
- Nothing?
- That's right. Nothing.

39:56.335 --> 40:01.172
Or we could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.

40:01.715 --> 40:05.677
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...

40:05.845 --> 40:09.848
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.

40:10.015 --> 40:14.561
Yes, professor.
And how long do you think he'll stay live?

40:14.728 --> 40:16.479
Well, that's his problem.

40:16.647 --> 40:19.691
What Mrs. Finley means, is...
- Oh, I know what she means.

40:19.859 --> 40:23.027
We can't sit back calmly
and wait to see who kills him first.

40:23.195 --> 40:25.029
Vandamm and company or the police.

40:26.449 --> 40:29.951
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?

40:30.119 --> 40:32.745
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?

40:32.913 --> 40:35.707
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.

40:35.875 --> 40:40.086
We didn't invent our nonexistent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...

40:40.254 --> 40:43.047
...and establish elaborate behavior patterns
for him...

40:43.215 --> 40:45.967
...and move his prop belongings
in and out of hotel rooms...

40:46.135 --> 40:48.386
...for our own private amusement.

40:48.804 --> 40:50.722
We created George Kaplan...

40:50.890 --> 40:53.183
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...

40:53.350 --> 40:57.228
...that this was our own agent hot on his
trail for a desperately important reason.

40:57.396 --> 40:59.606
Check.
- Nobody's denying that!

40:59.773 --> 41:01.107
Very well, then.

41:01.275 --> 41:05.403
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there is no such agent as George Kaplan...

41:05.571 --> 41:08.198
...give any hint to Vandamm
that he's pursuing a decoy...

41:08.365 --> 41:10.158
...instead of our own agent...

41:10.326 --> 41:13.912
...then our agent,
working right under Vandamm's very nose...

41:14.079 --> 41:17.248
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...

41:17.416 --> 41:19.584
...and assassination.

41:20.461 --> 41:22.170
Like the two others who went before.

41:22.338 --> 41:26.758
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill,
wherever you are.

41:31.931 --> 41:37.018
New York Central Railroad,
train number 25...

41:37.186 --> 41:40.939
...the 20th Century Limited...

41:41.106 --> 41:45.944
...due to leave at 6 p. m. For Chicago...

41:46.111 --> 41:52.408
...will depart from plank number 30.
- Yes. Yes, dear. I know.

41:52.576 --> 41:55.912
Now, listen to me, Mother, I beg you.
I called the Plaza.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.207
Kaplan checked out. He went
to the hotel Ambassador East in Chicago.

41:59.375 --> 42:01.459
Yes, that's why I'm...

42:01.627 --> 42:04.170
Well, I can't go to the police.
At least not yet.

42:04.338 --> 42:07.048
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife...

42:07.216 --> 42:10.426
...I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and I murdered a man for revenge.

42:10.594 --> 42:11.928
I wouldn't have a chance.

42:12.096 --> 42:16.432
And I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is all about.

42:16.892 --> 42:19.352
No, dear, the train. It's safer.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.606
Well, because there's no place to hide
on a plane if anyone should recognize me.

42:24.400 --> 42:27.360
You want me to jump off a moving plane?

42:27.570 --> 42:31.489
Yes. Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Yeah, well, goodbye.

42:34.660 --> 42:37.161
Attention, please.

42:37.329 --> 42:43.126
New York Central Railroad,
train number 25...

42:43.294 --> 42:46.462
...the 20th Century Limited...

42:47.339 --> 42:50.633
...due to leave at 6 p. m.

43:08.694 --> 43:09.694
Yeah.

43:09.862 --> 43:12.488
Uh, give me a bedroom
on the 20th Century, please.

43:12.656 --> 43:14.032
It's leaving in five minutes.

43:14.199 --> 43:17.702
- Yes, I know. Could you make it snappy?
- I think they're all sold out.

43:17.870 --> 43:20.580
- Sold out?
You can always go coach.

43:20.748 --> 43:23.374
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?

43:23.542 --> 43:26.628
Nothing till 10. You're in a hurry, huh?

43:26.795 --> 43:29.589
Well, could you call them
and see what they have?

43:29.757 --> 43:31.424
Something wrong with your eyes?

43:31.592 --> 43:34.552
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?

43:34.720 --> 43:36.554
Sure. Sure.

43:39.391 --> 43:41.309
Don't go away.

43:49.943 --> 43:53.446
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.

43:54.615 --> 43:56.741
You're in luck, mister, you...

44:03.582 --> 44:06.042
- Ticket?
- I'm just seeing some friends off.

44:07.586 --> 44:10.546
Sorry, I have to know their names
before I can let you through.

44:10.714 --> 44:11.756
Come here! Hey, come here!

44:41.495 --> 44:43.287
Oh.

44:44.456 --> 44:47.542
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- My fault.

44:48.127 --> 44:49.961
Sorry.

44:58.637 --> 45:01.305
He went that way. I think he got off.

45:01.473 --> 45:03.307
All aboard!

45:06.854 --> 45:09.021
- Thank you.
- It's quite all right.

45:09.189 --> 45:12.650
- Seven parking tickets.
- Oh.

46:30.896 --> 46:33.648
Good evening, sir. One?
- Please.

46:47.246 --> 46:48.496
Cocktail before dinner?

46:48.664 --> 46:50.915
- Yes, please. A Gibson.
Right away.

47:00.926 --> 47:04.262
- Well, here we are again.
- Yes.

47:05.806 --> 47:08.641
- Do you recommend anything?
- The brook trout.

47:08.809 --> 47:10.852
A little trouty, but quite good.

47:11.562 --> 47:12.603
Sold.

47:14.940 --> 47:17.400
Brook trout.

47:18.110 --> 47:19.777
- There you are. Thank you.
Yes, sir.

47:32.124 --> 47:35.293
- I know. I look vaguely familiar.
- Yes.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.378
You feel you've seen me
somewhere before.

47:39.715 --> 47:43.718
Funny how I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

47:43.886 --> 47:46.178
It's a nice face.

47:46.346 --> 47:50.016
- You think so?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

47:50.183 --> 47:53.394
Oh, you're that type.
- What type?

47:53.562 --> 47:55.104
Honest.

47:55.272 --> 47:56.397
Not really.

47:57.065 --> 48:00.818
- Good. Because honest women frighten me.
Why?

48:00.986 --> 48:03.821
I don't know. Somehow,
they seem to put me at a disadvantage.

48:03.989 --> 48:07.241
- Because you're not honest with them?
Exactly.

48:07.409 --> 48:10.494
Like that business
about the seven parking tickets?

48:10.662 --> 48:15.082
Well, what I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

48:15.250 --> 48:18.878
...I have to start pretending
I've no desire to make love to her.

48:19.212 --> 48:21.881
What makes you think you have
to conceal it?

48:22.049 --> 48:24.008
She might find the idea objectionable.

48:24.718 --> 48:26.177
Then again, she might not.

48:29.973 --> 48:32.433
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

48:32.601 --> 48:35.061
Oh, luck had nothing to do with it.

48:35.228 --> 48:36.979
Fate?

48:38.065 --> 48:42.109
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.

48:46.198 --> 48:47.281
Is that a proposition?

48:49.201 --> 48:51.452
I never discuss love
on an empty stomach.

48:52.371 --> 48:53.621
You've already eaten.

48:54.373 --> 48:55.456
But you haven't.

49:02.923 --> 49:05.007
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?

49:05.759 --> 49:09.220
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.

49:10.222 --> 49:12.431
Now you know everything.

49:12.599 --> 49:16.519
Tell me. What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?

49:16.687 --> 49:18.896
I'm an industrial designer.

49:20.315 --> 49:24.402
Jack Phillips. Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.

49:24.569 --> 49:28.531
No, you're not.
You're Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue...

49:28.699 --> 49:31.867
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.

49:32.035 --> 49:34.495
And don't be so modest.

49:34.663 --> 49:36.122
Whoops.

49:36.957 --> 49:38.082
Oh, don't worry.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.584
- I won't say a word.
- How come?

49:41.962 --> 49:43.671
I told you.

49:43.839 --> 49:45.047
It's a nice face.

49:45.549 --> 49:46.757
Is that the only reason?

49:47.467 --> 49:49.260
It's going to be a long night.

49:50.429 --> 49:51.429
True.

49:51.596 --> 49:54.265
And I don't particularly like the book
I've started.

49:56.184 --> 49:57.351
You know what I mean?

49:58.979 --> 50:01.022
Let me think.

50:04.443 --> 50:06.027
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.

50:18.874 --> 50:20.583
There's my trademark. R.O.T.

50:21.460 --> 50:24.712
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?

50:24.880 --> 50:26.756
Nothing.

50:49.488 --> 50:52.323
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.

50:52.866 --> 50:55.159
- A roomette?
- Nothing, not even a ticket.

50:55.327 --> 50:59.497
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.

51:00.248 --> 51:02.666
- How awkward for you.
- Yes, isn't it?

51:02.834 --> 51:04.085
No place to sleep.

51:05.504 --> 51:07.671
I have a large drawing room all to myself.

51:08.507 --> 51:10.299
That doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

51:11.343 --> 51:13.302
Drawing room E.

51:13.470 --> 51:15.304
Car 3901.

51:16.223 --> 51:17.640
Such a nice number.

51:19.184 --> 51:20.851
It's easy to remember.

51:21.019 --> 51:22.812
Thirty-nine-oh-one.

51:23.730 --> 51:24.772
See?

51:26.358 --> 51:27.358
No luggage.

51:31.029 --> 51:32.530
- So?
- Well, you wouldn't happen...

51:32.697 --> 51:35.241
...to have an extra pair of pajamas,
would you?

51:35.408 --> 51:36.659
Wouldn't I?

51:38.662 --> 51:41.831
Incidentally, I wouldn't order any dessert
if I were you.

51:41.998 --> 51:43.040
I get the message.

51:44.042 --> 51:45.626
That isn't exactly what I meant.

51:46.128 --> 51:48.379
This train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.

51:48.547 --> 51:52.550
And I just saw two men get out
of a police car as we pulled into the station.

51:53.218 --> 51:54.385
They weren't smiling.

52:16.783 --> 52:19.410
I think you better go out
and tell those police to hurry.

52:19.578 --> 52:21.162
Patience is a virtue.

52:21.329 --> 52:22.746
So is breathing.

52:22.914 --> 52:25.291
Just lie still.

52:26.209 --> 52:27.877
Have you got any olive oil?

52:28.044 --> 52:29.336
Olive oil?

52:29.504 --> 52:32.423
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm gonna be a sardine.

52:34.176 --> 52:35.634
Come in.

52:36.845 --> 52:39.513
- Who are you?
- State police.

52:40.265 --> 52:41.599
Your name please?

52:41.766 --> 52:44.268
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?

52:44.436 --> 52:47.605
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.

52:47.772 --> 52:50.608
- Yes.
Friend of yours?

52:50.775 --> 52:52.359
I never saw him before.

52:54.029 --> 52:55.696
Is this the man?

52:56.615 --> 52:59.867
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.

53:00.035 --> 53:02.953
It's a Wirephoto.
We just got it from the New York police.

53:03.121 --> 53:05.122
- Police?
- He's wanted for murder.

53:06.666 --> 53:08.292
Good heavens, no.

53:09.044 --> 53:11.587
The steward said
you left the dining car together.

53:11.755 --> 53:15.549
We might have happened to leave
at the same time, but not together.

53:16.301 --> 53:17.635
What did you two talk about?

53:18.678 --> 53:19.720
Talk about?

53:20.347 --> 53:23.349
Your waiter said you were getting along
good with this Thornhill.

53:23.516 --> 53:25.351
Is that his name? Thornhill?

53:26.061 --> 53:28.270
You mean, he didn't tell you?

53:28.438 --> 53:30.606
He didn't tell me anything.

53:30.774 --> 53:33.984
All we did was chat
about different kinds of food...

53:34.152 --> 53:37.112
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.

53:37.822 --> 53:42.243
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.

53:42.410 --> 53:45.329
- Who did he kill?
- He didn't say where he was going, did he?

53:46.331 --> 53:49.333
No. I assumed Chicago.

53:49.501 --> 53:51.585
You think perhaps he got off
when you got on?

53:52.712 --> 53:55.089
If you happen
to catch sight of him again, Miss, uh...

53:55.257 --> 53:56.340
Kendall.

53:56.508 --> 53:58.342
- Will you let us know?

53:58.927 --> 54:01.011
I'm going to bed
and I intend to lock my door.

54:01.179 --> 54:03.514
So I doubt if I'll seeing
anybody else tonight.

54:03.682 --> 54:07.977
Well, just in case you do, we'll be in
the observation car at the rear of the train.

54:08.144 --> 54:09.520
It's comforting to know that.

54:11.231 --> 54:12.314
Good night.

54:14.359 --> 54:15.651
Still breathing?

54:15.819 --> 54:18.904
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.

54:19.072 --> 54:22.700
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.

54:27.914 --> 54:29.373
Hello, there.

54:29.624 --> 54:31.166
Hello.

54:36.631 --> 54:37.923
Hmm.

54:43.221 --> 54:45.472
Tell me, why are you so good to me?

54:46.725 --> 54:48.726
Shall I climb up and tell you why?

55:02.907 --> 55:05.868
You know, I've been thinking,
it's not safe for you...

55:06.036 --> 55:08.996
...to roam around Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan man...

55:09.164 --> 55:11.165
...you've been telling me about.

55:11.624 --> 55:15.461
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.

55:15.628 --> 55:17.254
Such a nice face too.

55:20.133 --> 55:25.220
Now, don't you think it would be a better
idea if you stayed in my hotel room...

55:25.388 --> 55:29.600
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?

55:29.768 --> 55:32.603
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.

55:33.772 --> 55:35.189
I'm a big girl.

55:36.483 --> 55:39.026
Yeah, and in all the right places too.

55:44.115 --> 55:46.867
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?

55:47.035 --> 55:48.118
Yes.

55:48.286 --> 55:50.412
I mean, we've hardly met.

55:50.622 --> 55:52.247
That's right.

55:52.415 --> 55:55.084
How do I know you aren't a murderer?

55:55.251 --> 55:56.877
You don't.

55:57.045 --> 56:00.714
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.

56:01.549 --> 56:02.800
Shall I?

56:03.968 --> 56:05.260
Please do.

56:26.074 --> 56:27.825
Beats flying, doesn't it?

56:30.245 --> 56:31.829
We should stop.

56:31.996 --> 56:33.789
Immediately.

56:33.957 --> 56:36.166
I ought to know more about you.

56:36.751 --> 56:38.335
What more could you know?

56:41.214 --> 56:44.007
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.

56:44.175 --> 56:45.926
That's right.

56:47.887 --> 56:49.930
Train's a little unsteady.

56:50.098 --> 56:52.015
Who isn't?

56:52.183 --> 56:54.184
What else do you know?

56:55.562 --> 56:59.606
You've got taste in clothes,
taste in food...

57:01.693 --> 57:05.362
And taste in women. I like your flavor.

57:13.079 --> 57:15.247
You're very clever with words.

57:15.415 --> 57:18.208
You can probably make them
do anything for you.

57:19.377 --> 57:21.628
Sell people things they don't need...

57:21.796 --> 57:25.382
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.

57:27.385 --> 57:30.262
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.

57:43.735 --> 57:45.319
Look out.

57:54.746 --> 57:56.330
Oh, porter.

57:56.498 --> 57:59.208
- Don't bother with the washroom.
- Yes, ma'am.

57:59.375 --> 58:02.169
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?

58:02.337 --> 58:04.421
Yes, ma'am.
I've been looking all over for it.

58:04.589 --> 58:06.757
- I'll wait outside.
- Thank you.

58:23.816 --> 58:24.858
Thank you, porter.

58:25.276 --> 58:26.944
Thank you, ma'am. Good night, now.

58:27.111 --> 58:28.779
Good night.

58:32.825 --> 58:35.118
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

58:40.166 --> 58:41.625
The porter.

58:43.586 --> 58:45.212
So I see.

58:50.802 --> 58:52.427
Now...

58:53.137 --> 58:56.515
...where were we?
- Here.

58:58.643 --> 59:00.811
Oh, yes.

59:01.396 --> 59:05.274
- Nice of him to have opened the bed.
- Yes.

59:05.441 --> 59:08.944
- Only one bed.
- Yes.

59:09.112 --> 59:11.405
That's a good omen, don't you think?

59:11.573 --> 59:13.323
Wonderful.

59:14.325 --> 59:16.910
Do you know what that means?

59:17.078 --> 59:18.620
What? Tell me.

59:19.330 --> 59:22.457
It means you're going
to sleep on the floor.

59:43.855 --> 59:46.607
A message from the lady in 3901.

01:00:29.817 --> 01:00:32.569
- You keep walking. I'll catch up.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:00:34.072 --> 01:00:38.325
- Anything to report, Miss Kendall?
- Why, yes. I had a fine night's sleep.

01:00:39.077 --> 01:00:41.536
No, I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?

01:00:42.246 --> 01:00:45.248
- Mr. Thornycroft?
- Thornhill.

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:49.294
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.

01:00:49.462 --> 01:00:51.546
But good luck to you both.

01:00:55.843 --> 01:00:59.429
- How are we doing?
- Oh, I may collapse at any moment.

01:00:59.597 --> 01:01:01.973
Not yet.
First we have to run the gauntlet. Look.

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:03.266
Hmm?

01:01:08.272 --> 01:01:12.109
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?

01:01:12.276 --> 01:01:15.028
- Bowling balls, naturally.
- Oh, naturally.

01:01:15.196 --> 01:01:19.449
- Which one of these has my suit in it?
- The small one underneath your right arm.

01:01:19.617 --> 01:01:22.119
Oh, thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.

01:01:22.286 --> 01:01:24.705
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan
won't mind a few wrinkles.

01:01:24.872 --> 01:01:27.457
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?

01:01:27.834 --> 01:01:28.875
Nine-ten.

01:01:29.043 --> 01:01:31.795
Nine-ten? Well, he may have left
his hotel room by now.

01:01:31.963 --> 01:01:34.631
I'll call him for you
as soon as we get inside the station.

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:36.299
No thank you, I can do it.

01:01:36.467 --> 01:01:39.845
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.

01:01:40.012 --> 01:01:43.140
I, uh... Well, all right. What are you gonna
tell him? Do you know that?

01:01:43.307 --> 01:01:47.477
Mm-hm. You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.

01:01:47.645 --> 01:01:49.813
- Mm-hm. Right.
- No explanations.

01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:52.399
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.

01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:55.986
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?

01:01:56.154 --> 01:01:58.572
I sort of had the men's room in mind.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.490
Did you, now?

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:04.494
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.

01:02:16.174 --> 01:02:17.841
I think we made it.

01:02:21.512 --> 01:02:22.554
Where did he go?

01:02:22.722 --> 01:02:24.514
- Which way did he go?
- Where did he go?

01:02:24.682 --> 01:02:27.058
I don't know. He took my clothes.
And went that way.

01:02:27.226 --> 01:02:28.351
Come on.

01:04:07.159 --> 01:04:11.371
Departing at 10 a. m.,
Chicago daylight time...

01:04:11.539 --> 01:04:14.249
...for Michigan City.

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:39.441
Now ready on track number six.

01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:45.113
Well, what took you so long?

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:48.450
Well, I have a big face, small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.952
- Yes.
- Fine. What did he say?

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.164
Well, he'll see you, but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.

01:04:54.332 --> 01:04:56.666
- He'll see you on the outside.
- Well, where? When?

01:04:56.834 --> 01:04:59.085
- I've got it all written down for you.
- Thanks.

01:04:59.253 --> 01:05:01.546
Take the Greyhound bus
that leaves Chicago...

01:05:01.714 --> 01:05:07.719
...for Indianapolis at 2 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41.

01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:10.013
Prairie Stop, Highway 41. Good.

01:05:10.181 --> 01:05:12.515
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.

01:05:12.683 --> 01:05:13.725
Fine. I'll rent a car.

01:05:13.893 --> 01:05:18.396
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.

01:05:18.564 --> 01:05:21.066
All right. What'll I do when I get there?

01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:23.610
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.

01:05:23.778 --> 01:05:25.779
- Well, how will I know him?
- He'll know you.

01:05:25.947 --> 01:05:29.574
- You made the Chicago papers too.
- Oh, yes.

01:05:29.742 --> 01:05:31.868
Have you got your watch set
for Central time?

01:05:32.036 --> 01:05:34.037
Yes, I did that. Thanks.

01:05:34.872 --> 01:05:37.707
- What's the matter?
- Matter?

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:40.168
Yes, you seem... I don't know.
You seem tense.

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:43.213
You know, you better go before the police
run out of redcaps.

01:05:43.381 --> 01:05:45.924
We'll see each other again, won't we?

01:05:46.092 --> 01:05:47.842
Sometime, I'm sure.

01:05:48.886 --> 01:05:51.304
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.

01:05:51.472 --> 01:05:54.683
Please go.
- Yes, but... But where will I find you?

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.643
I've gotta pick up my bags now.

01:05:56.811 --> 01:05:59.896
Oh, yes. Well, these are the checks
for the large cases.

01:06:00.064 --> 01:06:01.398
Wait a minute.

01:06:02.066 --> 01:06:03.817
Please.

01:06:04.902 --> 01:06:06.736
They're coming.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.417
Hi.

01:10:33.587 --> 01:10:36.297
- Hot day.
- Seen worse.

01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:40.843
Are you supposed
to be meeting someone here?

01:10:41.011 --> 01:10:44.681
- Waiting for the bus. Due any minute.
- Oh.

01:10:45.349 --> 01:10:48.768
Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich,
if they live long enough.

01:10:49.853 --> 01:10:51.396
Yeah.

01:10:51.939 --> 01:10:55.191
And, uh, then your name isn't Kaplan?

01:10:55.859 --> 01:10:58.152
Can't say it is, because it ain't.

01:10:58.862 --> 01:11:01.447
Here she comes. Right on time.

01:11:04.743 --> 01:11:06.744
- That's funny.
- What?

01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:09.664
That plane's dusting crops
where there ain't no crops.

01:15:03.315 --> 01:15:06.692
Get out of here!
The other tank may blow!

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.621
What happened?

01:15:42.312 --> 01:15:44.105
Hey!

01:15:44.731 --> 01:15:46.482
Come back! Hey!

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:51.070
Come back! Come back! Hey!

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.494
- Yes?
- Uh...

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:43.873
Could you let me have
Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?

01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:45.333
- Kaplan?
- Yeah.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.210
I think he checked out.

01:16:48.378 --> 01:16:50.212
- He checked out?
- That's right.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.381
He checked out at 7:10 this morning.

01:16:52.549 --> 01:16:56.218
- Seven-ten? Are you sure?
- Yes. He left a forwarding address.

01:16:56.386 --> 01:16:59.347
Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,
Rapid City, South Dakota.

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.307
Seven-ten?

01:17:01.475 --> 01:17:04.060
Well, then how come I got a message
from him at 9...?

01:17:04.227 --> 01:17:05.728
What's that?

01:17:08.815 --> 01:17:10.524
Nothing. Nothing.

01:17:38.261 --> 01:17:40.262
Sorry to bother you again.

01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:43.307
Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.
She's in room four-something.

01:17:43.475 --> 01:17:46.102
I've forgotten the number.
Would you mind?

01:17:55.612 --> 01:17:58.447
- She's in 463.
- Oh, yes, that's right. Thanks.

01:18:24.641 --> 01:18:25.975
Hello.

01:18:32.190 --> 01:18:33.232
Surprised?

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:35.317
Yes.

01:18:36.486 --> 01:18:38.279
No getting rid of me, is there?

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.334
I could use a drink.

01:18:53.837 --> 01:18:57.381
- I have some Scotch.
- With water. No ice.

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.892
How did it go today?

01:19:10.937 --> 01:19:14.774
The meeting with Kaplan?

01:19:15.025 --> 01:19:16.942
He didn't show up.

01:19:17.778 --> 01:19:19.195
Oh?

01:19:19.362 --> 01:19:21.030
It's funny, isn't it?

01:19:21.531 --> 01:19:22.531
Why funny?

01:19:22.699 --> 01:19:28.412
Oh, after all those involved and explicit
directions he gave you on the phone.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.459
- Maybe I copied them down wrong.
- I don't think you got them wrong.

01:19:33.627 --> 01:19:37.129
I think you sent me to the right place,
all right.

01:19:38.423 --> 01:19:41.300
Why don't you call him back again
and see what happened?

01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:45.554
I did. He checked out.
Went to South Dakota.

01:19:45.722 --> 01:19:47.515
South Dakota?

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.558
Rapid City.

01:19:50.894 --> 01:19:52.645
Well, what are you going to do next?

01:19:53.563 --> 01:19:55.064
I haven't made my mind up yet.

01:19:55.565 --> 01:19:57.817
It may depend on you.

01:19:58.985 --> 01:20:01.821
- On me?
- Sure.

01:20:02.614 --> 01:20:05.115
You're my little helper, aren't you?

01:20:05.283 --> 01:20:10.246
Thank you. To us.
To a long and lasting friendship.

01:20:10.413 --> 01:20:15.125
Meaning, from now on, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.

01:20:15.293 --> 01:20:17.336
I'm afraid you'll have to.

01:20:17.504 --> 01:20:21.006
- Oh, no.
- I do have plans of my own, you know?

01:20:21.174 --> 01:20:22.925
And you do have problems.

01:20:23.093 --> 01:20:28.097
Well, wouldn't it be nice if my problems
and your plans were somehow connected?

01:20:28.265 --> 01:20:30.558
Then we could always stay close
to each other...

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.977
...and not have to go off
in separate directions.

01:20:33.144 --> 01:20:35.855
Togetherness. You know what I mean?

01:20:39.276 --> 01:20:41.735
Go ahead, it can't be for me.

01:20:49.327 --> 01:20:50.828
Hello?

01:20:51.288 --> 01:20:52.705
Yes.

01:20:52.873 --> 01:20:55.207
No, not yet. I'm not ready.

01:20:55.667 --> 01:21:00.379
What time?
I'll meet you. What's the address?

01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:05.634
Yes. Goodbye.

01:21:07.971 --> 01:21:09.388
Business?

01:21:09.556 --> 01:21:12.808
- Yes.
- Industrial-designing business?

01:21:16.313 --> 01:21:20.774
All work and no play? A girl like you
should be enjoying herself this evening...

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:24.320
...instead of taking phone calls
from clients.

01:21:25.488 --> 01:21:27.865
What about having dinner with me?

01:21:28.033 --> 01:21:32.745
- You can't afford to be seen anyplace.
- Well, let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.

01:21:32.913 --> 01:21:34.663
No, I...

01:21:35.332 --> 01:21:36.957
I can't.

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:39.877
I insist.

01:21:41.171 --> 01:21:43.672
I want you to do a favor for me.

01:21:44.215 --> 01:21:46.300
- A big, big favor.
- Name it.

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:49.303
I want you to leave right now.

01:21:50.096 --> 01:21:52.765
Stay far away from me
and don't come near me again.

01:21:56.186 --> 01:21:57.937
We're not going to get involved.

01:21:58.521 --> 01:22:01.190
Last night was last night
and that's all there was.

01:22:01.775 --> 01:22:05.027
That's all there is. There isn't going
to be anything more between us.

01:22:05.779 --> 01:22:07.571
So, please...

01:22:07.739 --> 01:22:08.781
Goodbye.

01:22:08.949 --> 01:22:11.700
Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.

01:22:12.369 --> 01:22:15.329
- Right away?
- Yes.

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:16.872
No questions asked?

01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:18.332
Yes.

01:22:20.043 --> 01:22:22.211
- No, I can't do that.
- Please.

01:22:23.046 --> 01:22:24.880
- After dinner.
- Now.

01:22:25.465 --> 01:22:27.716
After dinner. Fair is fair.

01:22:29.552 --> 01:22:31.220
All right.

01:22:31.388 --> 01:22:33.430
On one condition.

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:37.685
That you let the hotel valet
do something with this suit first.

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:40.062
You belong in the stockyards
looking like that.

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:41.939
Okay.

01:22:43.066 --> 01:22:44.942
There's the phone.

01:22:49.406 --> 01:22:52.157
Hello. Valet service, please.

01:22:55.912 --> 01:22:57.579
Hello, valet?

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:02.126
- Oh, this is r... Where are we?
- Four sixty-three.

01:23:02.293 --> 01:23:04.086
Room 463.

01:23:04.254 --> 01:23:06.672
How quickly can you get a suit
sponged and pressed?

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.590
Yes, fast.

01:23:08.758 --> 01:23:13.262
Twenty minutes? Fine. Okay, 463.

01:23:15.932 --> 01:23:17.349
He'll be right up.

01:23:17.517 --> 01:23:19.810
Better take your things off.

01:23:22.647 --> 01:23:25.983
Now, what could a man do
with his clothes off for 20 minutes?

01:23:26.151 --> 01:23:27.693
Couldn't he have taken an hour?

01:23:27.861 --> 01:23:29.820
You could always take a cold shower.

01:23:29.988 --> 01:23:31.739
That's right.

01:23:32.615 --> 01:23:36.118
You know, when I was a little boy,
I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.

01:23:36.286 --> 01:23:38.996
- You're a big boy now.
- Yes.

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:46.128
Tell me, how does a girl like you
get to be a girl like you?

01:23:47.464 --> 01:23:48.797
Lucky, I guess.

01:23:49.299 --> 01:23:53.635
Oh, not lucky. Naughty. Wicked.
Up to no good. Ever kill anyone?

01:23:55.221 --> 01:23:58.557
Because I bet you could tease a man
to death without half-trying.

01:23:58.725 --> 01:24:00.434
So stop trying, huh?

01:24:10.987 --> 01:24:12.988
Be with you in a minute.

01:24:16.926 --> 01:24:19.870
Trousers, please.

01:24:20.538 --> 01:24:22.122
There you are.

01:24:26.878 --> 01:24:28.670
Thank you.

01:24:29.339 --> 01:24:32.007
I think I'll take that cold shower after all.

01:24:32.175 --> 01:24:33.342
Good.

01:25:44.122 --> 01:25:46.790
This magnificent pair
of Louis XVI fauteuils.

01:25:46.958 --> 01:25:50.586
Original gilt finish.
Upholstered in pure silk damask.

01:25:50.753 --> 01:25:53.714
How much may I say to start?
What am I bid?

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:56.758
One hundred.
One hundred is bid. Thank you.

01:25:56.926 --> 01:25:59.386
One-fifty is bid here. Say the 200?

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:00.762
Thank you, 200 is bid.

01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:06.018
Say the 300? I have 300.
Four hundred by the little lady.

01:26:06.186 --> 01:26:07.227
Thank you, sir.

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:09.730
Four-fifty is bid for the pair.
Can I hear 500?

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:11.440
Will you say 500?

01:26:11.608 --> 01:26:13.525
Can I say the 500?

01:26:13.693 --> 01:26:15.611
Fair warning and last call.

01:26:15.778 --> 01:26:20.282
Sold to Mr. Stone, second row.
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:27.206
And now lot number 103.

01:26:27.874 --> 01:26:29.708
This lovely Aubusson settee.

01:26:29.876 --> 01:26:33.670
In excellent condition.
Please start the bidding.

01:26:33.838 --> 01:26:35.464
How much?

01:26:35.632 --> 01:26:39.551
Eight hundred is offered, thank you.
Eight hundred is bid. Say the nine? Go 900?

01:26:39.719 --> 01:26:42.137
Nine hundred is bid.
Now, who'll say 1,000?

01:26:42.805 --> 01:26:46.141
One thousand, thank you.
One thousand at 1,000. Say 1,100?

01:26:46.309 --> 01:26:50.729
- Can I hear 1,100? Selling at $1,000.
- The three of you together.

01:26:50.897 --> 01:26:53.857
Now, that's a picture
only Charles Addams could draw.

01:26:54.025 --> 01:26:55.651
Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.

01:26:55.818 --> 01:26:58.904
Before we start calling
each other names, you better tell me yours.

01:26:59.072 --> 01:27:01.990
- I haven't had the pleasure.
- You disappoint me, sir.

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.534
I was just going to say that to her.

01:27:04.702 --> 01:27:07.579
I've always understood
you were a shrewd fellow at your job.

01:27:07.747 --> 01:27:10.582
What possessed you
to come blundering in here like this?

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:12.960
Could it be an overpowering interest
in art?

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:15.837
Yes. The art of survival.

01:27:16.881 --> 01:27:19.174
Well, have you poured
any good drunks lately?

01:27:19.759 --> 01:27:22.427
One hundred dollars.
- He followed me here from the hotel.

01:27:23.513 --> 01:27:25.222
He was in your room?

01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:26.932
Sure, isn't everybody?

01:27:27.517 --> 01:27:29.935
One hundred and fifty. Thank you.
Now, say the two.

01:27:30.103 --> 01:27:32.062
Do I hear two? Two hundred, thank you.

01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:35.190
Now the three. Do I hear three?
Three hundred, anyone?

01:27:35.358 --> 01:27:38.944
Three hundred, thank you. Now, the four.
Do I hear four? Four hundred, anyone?

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:43.573
Four hundred is bid. Say the five?
I have 400. I have 400.

01:27:43.741 --> 01:27:47.494
I didn't realize you were an art collector.
I thought you just collected corpses.

01:27:48.705 --> 01:27:51.498
- Five hundred.
Five hundred, thank you.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:54.584
I'll bet you paid plenty
for this little piece of sculpture.

01:27:54.752 --> 01:27:57.212
Now the seven. Seven hundred?
- Seven hundred.

01:27:57.630 --> 01:28:00.007
She's worth every dollar of it,
take it from me.

01:28:00.967 --> 01:28:03.051
Now, she puts her heart into her work.

01:28:03.219 --> 01:28:05.679
In fact, her whole body.

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:08.056
Sold to Mr. Vandamm at 700.

01:28:08.641 --> 01:28:13.729
- Number 106 for your pleasure.
- Oh, Mr. Vandamm.

01:28:13.896 --> 01:28:17.607
Has anyone ever told you that you overplay
your various roles rather severely...

01:28:17.775 --> 01:28:19.067
...Mr. Kaplan?

01:28:19.235 --> 01:28:21.445
First, you're the outraged
Madison Avenue man...

01:28:21.612 --> 01:28:23.905
...who claims he's been mistaken
for someone else.

01:28:24.407 --> 01:28:25.907
Then, you play the fugitive...

01:28:26.075 --> 01:28:29.578
...supposedly trying to clear his name
of a crime he knows he didn't commit.

01:28:29.746 --> 01:28:34.499
Now you play the peevish lover,
stung by jealousy and betrayal.

01:28:35.293 --> 01:28:38.170
It seems you fellows could stand
less training from the FBI...

01:28:38.338 --> 01:28:41.298
...and more from the Actors Studio.
Three-fifty I have.

01:28:41.466 --> 01:28:45.093
Apparently, the only performance
that'll satisfy you is when I play dead.

01:28:45.595 --> 01:28:48.430
Your very next role.
You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.

01:28:48.598 --> 01:28:52.059
Don't lose it for $25.
Thank you. Three-seventy-five is bid.

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:54.269
I have 375, go the 400.

01:28:54.437 --> 01:28:56.897
Three-seventy-five, go four?
Four hundred is bid.

01:28:57.065 --> 01:29:01.401
I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter
is next on the program.

01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:03.987
Am I to be dropped
into a vat of molten steel...

01:29:04.155 --> 01:29:06.823
...and become part of a new skyscraper?

01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:11.870
Or are you going to ask this female
to kiss me again and poison me to death?

01:29:12.038 --> 01:29:14.206
We offer catalog number 107.

01:29:14.374 --> 01:29:18.627
Who are you kidding?
You have no feelings to hurt.

01:29:21.964 --> 01:29:24.716
How much to start the bidding
on this collector's porcelain?

01:29:24.884 --> 01:29:26.051
Please start the bidding.

01:29:26.219 --> 01:29:28.261
Kaplan, we've had just about enough
of you.

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:30.389
Then, why don't you send for the police?

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:35.560
That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?
Me in the hands of the police.

01:29:35.728 --> 01:29:37.771
There's something I might tell them.

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:40.649
That's the reason you had this one
hustle me on the train.

01:29:40.817 --> 01:29:44.653
Something seems to tell me
I've got a better chance if I go to the police.

01:29:46.239 --> 01:29:48.573
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't think it wasn't nice.

01:29:48.741 --> 01:29:53.662
Say the 12. Twelve hundred dollars
there. Twelve hundred is bid. Say 1300?

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:55.747
May I hear 1300?

01:29:55.915 --> 01:29:58.750
They're selling at 1200.
Do I hear 1300, please?

01:29:59.669 --> 01:30:01.461
Last call.

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:05.382
Sold. Twelve hundred dollars. Thank you.

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:13.598
And now catalog number 109.

01:30:14.517 --> 01:30:18.437
This superb example
of this early 17th century master.

01:30:18.604 --> 01:30:20.856
It will enhance any collection of fine art.

01:30:21.524 --> 01:30:24.651
What is your pleasure?
How much to start?

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:28.363
One thousand dollars.
One thousand is bid.

01:30:28.531 --> 01:30:31.533
Twelve-fifty I have. Now, 1500.

01:30:32.243 --> 01:30:35.287
Fifteen hundred is bid. Thank you.
Seventeen-fifty?

01:30:37.206 --> 01:30:39.458
- I have 1750.
Two thousand dollars.

01:30:39.625 --> 01:30:44.045
Two thousand is bid. I have 2000.
Do I hear 2500?

01:30:44.213 --> 01:30:46.339
Twenty-five hundred, anyone?

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.549
Twenty-two-fifty once.

01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.052
Twenty-two-fifty twice.

01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:54.181
- Last call.
- Fifteen hundred.

01:30:55.099 --> 01:30:59.311
- Well, the bid is already up to 2250, sir.
- I still say 1,500.

01:31:01.647 --> 01:31:05.817
I have 2250. Do I hear 25?

01:31:05.985 --> 01:31:09.696
- Twenty-two-fifty once, 2250 twice.
- Twelve hundred.

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:14.367
- Sold for 2250. And now...
- Twenty-two-fifty for that chromo?

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:21.249
Number 110 in the catalog.

01:31:21.667 --> 01:31:24.878
A Louis XV carved
and gilded lit de repos.

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:27.964
Would somebody start the bidding
at $750, please?

01:31:28.132 --> 01:31:30.884
How do we know it's not a fake?
It looks like a fake.

01:31:34.263 --> 01:31:38.558
Well, one thing we know:
You're no fake. You're a genuine idiot.

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:40.268
Thank you.

01:31:40.436 --> 01:31:42.854
I wonder if I could respectfully ask
the gentleman...

01:31:43.022 --> 01:31:45.106
...to get into the spirit
of the proceedings.

01:31:45.274 --> 01:31:46.858
All right. I'll start it at 8.

01:31:47.985 --> 01:31:50.946
Eight hundred. Thank you. Nine hundred?

01:31:51.614 --> 01:31:54.616
- One thousand is bid. Go 12?
- Eleven.

01:31:55.117 --> 01:31:58.119
Eleven is bid. Thank you. Go 12.

01:31:58.287 --> 01:32:01.790
I have 11. Go 12. Who'll say 12?

01:32:01.958 --> 01:32:04.167
Eleven once. Who'll say 12?

01:32:04.335 --> 01:32:06.962
Eleven twice. Twelve, thank you.

01:32:07.129 --> 01:32:10.340
Twelve is bid. I have 12. Go 13.
Who'll say 13?

01:32:10.508 --> 01:32:11.633
Thirteen dollars.

01:32:14.303 --> 01:32:15.762
You mean 1300, sir.

01:32:16.806 --> 01:32:19.474
No, no, no, I mean $13.
That's more than it's worth.

01:32:22.228 --> 01:32:23.603
I...

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:27.774
I have 1200. Go 13. Who'll say 13?

01:32:28.359 --> 01:32:30.235
Who'll say 1250?

01:32:32.488 --> 01:32:35.448
Twelve hundred once, 1200 twice.

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.826
- Last call. Twelve hundred.
- Two thousand.

01:32:41.372 --> 01:32:42.414
Two thousand?

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.500
Twenty-one hundred.

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.378
I'm sorry, sir, but we can't...

01:32:48.546 --> 01:32:50.964
- Make it 2500.
Ask him to leave.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.764
- Would the gentleman please cooperate?
- The last bid was 1200.

01:32:59.932 --> 01:33:03.351
Twenty-five hundred.
My money's as good as anybody's.

01:33:03.853 --> 01:33:06.187
- Well, isn't it? Isn't it?
- I have...

01:33:06.355 --> 01:33:08.690
- What was it?
- Twelve hundred.

01:33:08.858 --> 01:33:12.110
I have 1200 once, 1200 twice.

01:33:12.278 --> 01:33:15.697
- Three thousand.
Sold for 1200.

01:33:18.075 --> 01:33:21.202
- I'm not gonna let you get away with that.
- You'd better leave, sir.

01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:23.538
No, you take your hands off me
or I'll sue you.

01:33:38.054 --> 01:33:40.347
- What took you so long?
- Let's take a little walk.

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:42.724
- Get moving.
- I haven't finished bidding yet.

01:33:42.892 --> 01:33:45.560
Three thousand. I bid 3000.

01:33:45.728 --> 01:33:48.480
I'm sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying.

01:33:49.732 --> 01:33:51.733
Not so rough.

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.868
- Handle with care, fellas.
- In there.

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:04.412
- I'm valuable property.
- In.

01:34:07.917 --> 01:34:12.045
Well, I want to thank you for saving my life.
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.589
Save it for the station house.

01:34:18.928 --> 01:34:21.513
Well, let's have some smiles
and good cheer.

01:34:21.681 --> 01:34:25.600
You're about to become heroes.
Don't you know who I am?

01:34:25.768 --> 01:34:29.688
We'll find out as soon as we book you
for being drunk and disorderly.

01:34:29.855 --> 01:34:33.191
Drunk and disorderly? That's chicken feed.
You've hit the jackpot.

01:34:33.359 --> 01:34:37.862
Chicago police capture
United Nations killer.

01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:39.989
My name is Roger Thornhill.

01:34:40.491 --> 01:34:41.950
Here.

01:34:45.454 --> 01:34:48.456
- It's him.
- That's right. Congratulations, man.

01:34:49.166 --> 01:34:50.208
Yeah.

01:34:50.376 --> 01:34:52.627
This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm.

01:34:52.795 --> 01:34:57.006
We've got a man here who answers
to the description of Thornhill, Roger.

01:34:57.174 --> 01:34:58.842
Code 76.

01:34:59.009 --> 01:35:02.971
Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID.

01:35:03.639 --> 01:35:05.140
Absolutely. No question.

01:35:07.017 --> 01:35:10.228
Michigan Avenue.
Proceeding north to 42nd precinct.

01:35:13.357 --> 01:35:14.941
What?

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.402
Come again?

01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.614
Are you sure?

01:35:22.658 --> 01:35:24.367
Okay. Right.

01:35:24.535 --> 01:35:26.035
Yeah, I got it.

01:35:26.203 --> 01:35:28.580
One-oh-five-five, off and clear.

01:35:30.541 --> 01:35:32.667
- Where are we going?
- Airport.

01:35:33.335 --> 01:35:35.628
- For what?
- Orders.

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:38.006
Airport? I don't wanna be taken
to an airport.

01:35:38.174 --> 01:35:42.010
- I want to be taken to police headquarters.
- You do, huh?

01:35:42.178 --> 01:35:43.845
Why do you think I sent for you?

01:35:44.013 --> 01:35:46.931
How about this guy, Charlie?
He sent for us.

01:35:47.099 --> 01:35:48.933
- Sit back.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:52.228
I want to be taken to police headquarters.
I'm a dangerous assassin.

01:35:52.396 --> 01:35:56.524
- I'm a mad killer on the loose.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:23.885
They said right here.

01:36:24.053 --> 01:36:27.388
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.

01:36:38.567 --> 01:36:41.694
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.

01:36:42.279 --> 01:36:43.655
All right, men. Thank you.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.074
- This way, Mr. Thornhill.
- Wait a minute.

01:36:46.242 --> 01:36:49.702
We haven't much time.
Yeah, this way is more private.

01:36:53.415 --> 01:36:57.377
- I don't think I caught your name.
- I don't think I pitched it.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.421
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?

01:37:00.589 --> 01:37:02.382
FBI, CIA, ONI.

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:04.884
- We're all in the same alphabet soup.
- Really?

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:09.013
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.

01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:11.307
- We know that.
- You know it?

01:37:11.475 --> 01:37:14.143
Then why did you let the police
chase me all over the map?

01:37:14.311 --> 01:37:18.398
We never interfere with the police,
unless absolutely necessary.

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:20.942
- It's become necessary.
- Oh, I see.

01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:23.236
Well, then, I take it
I'm going to be cleared.

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:26.406
I do wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:28.658
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?

01:37:28.826 --> 01:37:31.077
Rapid City, South Dakota.

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:34.747
- Rapid City? What for?
- It's near Mount Rushmore.

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:36.791
No, thank you.
I've seen Mount Rushmore.

01:37:36.959 --> 01:37:39.586
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.

01:37:39.962 --> 01:37:41.713
Vandamm?

01:37:41.881 --> 01:37:44.632
A rather formidable
kind of gentleman, eh?

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.093
What about that treacherous little tramp
with him?

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:48.511
- Miss Kendall?
- Yeah.

01:37:48.679 --> 01:37:51.014
His mistress. We know all about her.

01:37:52.516 --> 01:37:54.475
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?

01:37:54.643 --> 01:37:57.520
Oh, you could say he's a sort
of importer-exporter.

01:37:57.688 --> 01:37:59.022
Of what?

01:37:59.189 --> 01:38:01.983
Oh. Government secrets, perhaps.

01:38:02.568 --> 01:38:04.319
Well, then why don't you grab him?

01:38:04.486 --> 01:38:07.322
There's still too much we don't know
about his organization.

01:38:07.489 --> 01:38:08.823
Oh, I see.

01:38:08.991 --> 01:38:11.242
What's all this got to do
with Mount Rushmore?

01:38:11.410 --> 01:38:13.745
Well, Vandamm has a place near there.

01:38:13.913 --> 01:38:17.248
We think it's his jumping-off point
to leave the country tomorrow night.

01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:19.834
- Are you gonna stop him?
- No.

01:38:20.002 --> 01:38:21.836
Well, then what are we going there for?

01:38:22.004 --> 01:38:24.005
To set his mind at ease
about George Kaplan.

01:38:25.758 --> 01:38:28.509
Oh, you, huh?
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?

01:38:28.677 --> 01:38:31.846
Oh, no, Mr. Thornhill.
There is no such person as George Kaplan.

01:38:32.014 --> 01:38:33.890
What do you mean? I've been in his room.

01:38:34.058 --> 01:38:36.976
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff.

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:39.854
Believe me, Mr. Thornhill,
he doesn't exist.

01:38:40.022 --> 01:38:45.944
Which is why I'm gonna have to ask you
to go on being him for the next 24 hours.

01:38:46.111 --> 01:38:48.529
Come on. We'll discuss it on the plane.

01:39:09.885 --> 01:39:14.138
Now, look. You started this decoy business
without me, you finish it without me.

01:39:14.306 --> 01:39:16.391
We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

01:39:16.558 --> 01:39:20.228
You ought to give me a medal
instead of asking me to be a target...

01:39:20.396 --> 01:39:23.398
...just so your special agent or whatever
doesn't get shot at.

01:39:23.565 --> 01:39:28.611
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
Once found out, they're as good as dead.

01:39:28.779 --> 01:39:32.573
Thanks to you,
clouds of suspicion are already forming.

01:39:32.741 --> 01:39:34.325
Thanks to me?

01:39:34.493 --> 01:39:36.911
- If you'll get on the plane...
- You listen to me.

01:39:37.079 --> 01:39:41.666
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

01:39:41.834 --> 01:39:44.585
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

01:39:44.753 --> 01:39:48.047
...and I don't intend to disappoint them all
by getting myself killed.

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:50.466
The answer is no.

01:39:50.634 --> 01:39:52.927
- Is that final?
- Yes.

01:39:53.095 --> 01:39:55.179
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

01:39:55.347 --> 01:39:58.850
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall.

01:39:59.935 --> 01:40:01.769
Of whom you so obviously disapprove.

01:40:01.937 --> 01:40:05.440
Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly swatter.

01:40:06.025 --> 01:40:07.942
I don't suppose it would matter to you...

01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:12.113
...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

01:40:12.281 --> 01:40:14.490
To protect herself from what?

01:40:14.658 --> 01:40:17.535
Exposure and assassination.

01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:20.788
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she...

01:40:21.457 --> 01:40:23.332
She's one of our agents.

01:40:24.334 --> 01:40:26.836
- Oh, no.
- I know you didn't mean it...

01:40:27.004 --> 01:40:31.591
...but I'm afraid you have put her
in an extremely dangerous situation.

01:40:32.968 --> 01:40:35.344
And much more than her life is at stake.

01:40:49.985 --> 01:40:53.237
- Suppose they don't come?
- They'll come.

01:40:54.865 --> 01:40:58.159
I don't like the way
Teddy Roosevelt is looking at me.

01:40:58.327 --> 01:41:02.205
Perhaps he's trying to give you
one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

01:41:02.372 --> 01:41:04.415
Speak soft, and carry a big stick.

01:41:04.833 --> 01:41:08.086
He's trying to tell me not to go through
with this harebrained scheme.

01:41:08.253 --> 01:41:11.506
He doesn't know to what extent
you're the cause of our present trouble.

01:41:12.007 --> 01:41:14.675
I don't know that I care
to accept that charge, professor.

01:41:14.843 --> 01:41:18.262
Dear, fellow, if you hadn't made yourself
so attractive to Miss Kendall...

01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:20.890
...that she fell for you...
- And vice versa.

01:41:21.058 --> 01:41:24.352
- Our friend Vandamm wouldn't
be losing faith in her loyalty now.

01:41:24.895 --> 01:41:28.689
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

01:41:28.857 --> 01:41:33.111
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:35.780
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

01:41:35.948 --> 01:41:39.450
I'm trying to remind you it is your
responsibility to help us restore her...

01:41:39.618 --> 01:41:41.035
...to Vandamm's good graces...

01:41:41.203 --> 01:41:44.205
...right up to the point
he leaves the country tonight.

01:41:44.373 --> 01:41:45.706
All right, all right.

01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:47.875
But, after tonight...

01:41:48.877 --> 01:41:50.878
My blessings on you both.

01:42:05.394 --> 01:42:07.019
Here they are.

01:43:00.532 --> 01:43:03.534
- Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
- Not her.

01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:15.421
Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:17.798
We'll get to that later.

01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:20.593
I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:24.597
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:27.642
By the way, I want to compliment you
on your colorful exit...

01:43:27.809 --> 01:43:29.977
...from the auction gallery.

01:43:30.145 --> 01:43:31.312
Thank you.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:34.440
And now, what little drama
are we here for today?

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:38.361
I don't for a moment believe that you've
invited me to these gay surroundings...

01:43:38.528 --> 01:43:40.905
...to come to a business arrangement.

01:43:42.491 --> 01:43:46.702
Suppose I tell you I not only know the exact
time you're leaving the country tonight...

01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:49.413
...but the latitude and longitude
of your rendezvous...

01:43:49.581 --> 01:43:51.832
...and your ultimate destination.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.669
You wouldn't care to carry my bags for me,
would you?

01:43:54.836 --> 01:43:58.089
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

01:43:58.257 --> 01:44:01.842
- The price?
- For doing nothing to stop you.

01:44:03.053 --> 01:44:05.346
How much did you have in mind?

01:44:06.014 --> 01:44:07.765
I want the girl.

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:12.937
I want the girl to get
what's coming to her.

01:44:13.105 --> 01:44:16.482
Turn her over to me, I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.360
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.

01:44:20.195 --> 01:44:23.072
You do that,
and I'll look the other way tonight.

01:44:23.615 --> 01:44:25.616
She really did get under your skin.

01:44:25.784 --> 01:44:28.619
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.

01:44:28.787 --> 01:44:32.790
- I'm offering you a chance to save it.
To exchange it.

01:44:33.542 --> 01:44:34.709
Put it any way you like.

01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:37.712
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.

01:44:37.879 --> 01:44:41.299
What made you arrive at the deduction that
my feelings for Miss Kendall...

01:44:41.466 --> 01:44:46.804
...have deteriorated to the point where
I would trade her in for peace of mind?

01:44:46.972 --> 01:44:50.057
I don't deduce. I observe.

01:44:52.394 --> 01:44:55.855
Phillip, if you don't mind,
I'm going back to the house now.

01:45:08.118 --> 01:45:09.243
Just a second, you.

01:45:09.411 --> 01:45:13.039
Stay away from me. Let go.
Let go of me.

01:45:13.582 --> 01:45:15.499
Stay away from me. Let go.

01:45:15.667 --> 01:45:17.335
Let go of me.

01:45:17.502 --> 01:45:21.255
- Now, save the phony tears.
- You just get back.

01:45:22.799 --> 01:45:26.010
- You little fool.
- You just stay away from me.

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:33.601
No good, sir.
You can't get involved in this.

01:45:38.106 --> 01:45:40.107
- Don't touch anything.
- Stand back.

01:45:40.275 --> 01:45:41.359
Stand back.

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.995
Mr. Thornhill?

01:46:42.838 --> 01:46:44.338
Don't be long.

01:46:48.009 --> 01:46:49.802
Hello.

01:46:50.387 --> 01:46:51.887
Hello.

01:46:52.055 --> 01:46:53.889
Are you all right?

01:46:54.891 --> 01:46:56.725
Yes, I think so.

01:46:56.893 --> 01:46:59.728
I asked the professor
if I could see you again.

01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:04.066
There's not much time.

01:47:05.527 --> 01:47:06.861
Isn’t there?

01:47:07.737 --> 01:47:09.822
I wanted to tell you...

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:11.282
I mean, apologize.

01:47:12.868 --> 01:47:14.368
No need.

01:47:15.537 --> 01:47:17.288
I understand.

01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.375
All in the line of duty.

01:47:22.544 --> 01:47:24.837
I did treat you miserably.

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.714
I, uh...

01:47:26.882 --> 01:47:28.966
I hated you for it.

01:47:29.134 --> 01:47:31.469
I didn't want you to go on
thinking that I...

01:47:32.971 --> 01:47:36.724
And I... I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.

01:47:36.892 --> 01:47:38.726
They hurt deeply.

01:47:38.894 --> 01:47:42.104
- Well, naturally, if I'd known...
- I couldn't tell you.

01:47:42.731 --> 01:47:44.023
- Of course not.
- Could I?

01:47:45.942 --> 01:47:47.318
No, I guess not.

01:47:49.404 --> 01:47:52.531
You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
- Of course I was hurt.

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:55.409
- How would you have felt?
- In the cafeteria, when you fell.

01:47:55.577 --> 01:47:59.079
- When I shot you with the blanks.
- Oh, that. No.

01:47:59.748 --> 01:48:04.084
You did it rather well, I thought.
- Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

01:48:04.628 --> 01:48:07.755
Considering
it's not really your kind of work.

01:48:08.590 --> 01:48:12.843
Well, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

01:48:14.179 --> 01:48:18.641
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

01:48:18.808 --> 01:48:20.267
Oh.

01:48:21.478 --> 01:48:24.271
I guess I had nothing to do
that weekend, so I...

01:48:24.439 --> 01:48:26.774
I decided to fall in love.

01:48:27.359 --> 01:48:29.568
Well, that's nice.

01:48:30.487 --> 01:48:35.282
Eventually, the professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

01:48:35.992 --> 01:48:40.454
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

01:48:40.622 --> 01:48:44.583
...my relationship with him
made me uniquely valuable to them.

01:48:46.378 --> 01:48:49.255
So you became a Girl Scout, huh?

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:52.883
Maybe it was the first time anyone
ever asked me to do anything worthwhile.

01:48:55.303 --> 01:48:56.720
Has life been like that?

01:48:59.975 --> 01:49:01.475
How come?

01:49:03.478 --> 01:49:05.479
Men like you.

01:49:06.481 --> 01:49:08.816
What's wrong with men like me?

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:11.235
They don't believe in marriage.

01:49:11.403 --> 01:49:13.153
I've been married twice.

01:49:13.321 --> 01:49:14.446
See what I mean?

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:19.660
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.

01:49:26.418 --> 01:49:27.918
Goodbye, darling.

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:32.548
- Wait a minute. Not so soon.
- No, I gotta get back and convince them...

01:49:32.716 --> 01:49:35.843
...that I took the long way around
so nobody followed me.

01:49:37.679 --> 01:49:39.972
Couldn't we stand like this
for just a few hours?

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.683
Just this time you're supposed
to be critically wounded.

01:49:42.851 --> 01:49:44.852
I never felt more alive.

01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:46.437
Well, whose side are you on?

01:49:47.564 --> 01:49:48.939
Yours, always, darling.

01:49:50.025 --> 01:49:52.943
Please don't undermine my resolve
just when I need it most.

01:50:01.536 --> 01:50:05.831
Oh, well, I guess it's off to the hospital
for me and back to danger for you.

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:07.708
I don't like it a bit.

01:50:07.876 --> 01:50:11.920
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

01:50:12.088 --> 01:50:14.340
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:16.091
All right. I won't.

01:50:16.259 --> 01:50:19.511
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:23.849
...you and I are gonna get together and do a
lot of apologizing to each other in private.

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:27.311
- You know that can't be.
- Of course it can be.

01:50:30.565 --> 01:50:32.733
He has told you, hasn't he?

01:50:33.234 --> 01:50:36.278
- Told me what?
- Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving.

01:50:36.446 --> 01:50:39.740
- Wait a minute. What didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you?

01:50:40.742 --> 01:50:43.911
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

01:50:45.455 --> 01:50:47.081
She's going off with Vandamm?

01:50:47.248 --> 01:50:50.250
We went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

01:50:50.418 --> 01:50:53.420
So that Vandamm couldn't very well decline
to take her along.

01:50:53.588 --> 01:50:56.423
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.426
You lied to me.
You said that after tonight...

01:50:59.594 --> 01:51:02.304
- I needed your help.
- Well, you got it, all right.

01:51:02.472 --> 01:51:03.597
Don't be angry.

01:51:03.765 --> 01:51:06.016
You think I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

01:51:06.184 --> 01:51:08.852
- Oh, she has to.
- Nobody has to do anything.

01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.105
I don't like the games
you play, professor.

01:51:12.107 --> 01:51:15.067
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

01:51:15.944 --> 01:51:18.362
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

01:51:18.822 --> 01:51:21.740
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:23.450
...and never come back...

01:51:23.618 --> 01:51:26.286
...perhaps you ought to learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

01:51:26.996 --> 01:51:29.498
I'm afraid we're already doing that.

01:51:35.964 --> 01:51:40.259
- I'm not gonna let you do this. Get out.
- Please don't spoil everything. Please.

01:51:45.348 --> 01:51:49.435
Mr. Kaplan twice in full
view of horrified men, women and children...

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:52.980
...who had come to the park to see
the famed Mount Rushmore monument.

01:51:53.148 --> 01:51:58.652
Witnesses described Kaplan's assailant
as an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:02.614
Kaplan, who was removed to the
Rapid City Hospital in critical condition...

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:06.785
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

01:52:06.953 --> 01:52:09.371
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

01:52:09.539 --> 01:52:12.750
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria...

01:52:12.917 --> 01:52:15.919
...stated that he heard voices raised in...

01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:24.011
- Here we are.
- Hello.

01:52:24.179 --> 01:52:26.847
Slacks, a shirt and these.

01:52:27.015 --> 01:52:28.182
Thanks.

01:52:28.349 --> 01:52:31.935
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

01:52:32.687 --> 01:52:35.022
For the next couple of days?

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:36.690
- Hey.
- What?

01:52:36.858 --> 01:52:37.941
What's this?

01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:41.236
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

01:52:41.404 --> 01:52:43.572
You and your dopey schemes, shootings.

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:47.534
- Otherwise, feeling all right?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

01:52:47.702 --> 01:52:50.829
Considering your driver
has a sledgehammer for a hand.

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:52.873
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

01:52:53.041 --> 01:52:55.584
No, that's all right. I guess I deserved it.

01:52:56.377 --> 01:52:58.545
I guess I deserve that locked door too.

01:52:58.713 --> 01:53:02.633
You seen wandering about in good health
could've proved fatal to Miss Kendall.

01:53:03.551 --> 01:53:06.553
- I've begun to forget her already.
- Good.

01:53:06.721 --> 01:53:09.223
- Better that way.
- Yeah, much.

01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:12.017
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

01:53:14.562 --> 01:53:18.440
- How's everything out in Rapid City?
- Oh, everything's fine.

01:53:18.608 --> 01:53:22.653
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has now
acquired the authority of the printed word.

01:53:22.821 --> 01:53:25.280
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

01:53:25.448 --> 01:53:27.032
Well, now you can include me.

01:53:27.742 --> 01:53:29.910
- I'm a cooperator.
- I'm most grateful.

01:53:30.411 --> 01:53:33.497
- Care to do me a favor in return?
- Anything.

01:53:33.665 --> 01:53:36.792
I'd like a drink. Will you get me a...?
Get me some bourbon?

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.502
A pint will do.

01:53:39.003 --> 01:53:40.087
Can I join you?

01:53:40.255 --> 01:53:43.382
Well, if you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:46.385
- See you in a few minutes.
- Yeah.

01:54:50.491 --> 01:54:53.243
- Stop.
- Oh, excuse me.

01:54:53.411 --> 01:54:55.162
Stop.

01:55:18.853 --> 01:55:21.855
- You don't want me to take you up there?
- No, thanks. Never mind.

01:55:22.023 --> 01:55:23.523
Oh, thanks.

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:11.358
There's nothing to worry about.
I just lost my head.

01:58:11.526 --> 01:58:14.611
I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

01:58:14.779 --> 01:58:16.154
I mean it.

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:18.365
I just didn't know what I was doing.

01:58:18.533 --> 01:58:21.034
He wanted to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

01:58:21.202 --> 01:58:23.703
But not endanger you.
Ah, rubbish.

01:58:24.372 --> 01:58:28.542
Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

01:58:30.044 --> 01:58:31.878
What's the situation, Leonard?

01:58:32.046 --> 01:58:34.256
- About the plane, you mean?
- Of course.

01:58:34.423 --> 01:58:36.007
What was the last report?

01:58:36.175 --> 01:58:39.511
Over Whitestone on the hour,
6000, descending.

01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:42.389
About ten minutes, huh?
At the most.

01:58:42.557 --> 01:58:44.474
And now, uh...

01:58:44.642 --> 01:58:47.561
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

01:58:47.728 --> 01:58:49.354
Certainly.

01:58:49.730 --> 01:58:51.439
In private?

01:58:52.483 --> 01:58:54.401
I'll go up and get my things.

01:58:54.902 --> 01:58:56.278
Well, Leonard...

01:58:56.445 --> 01:59:00.282
...how does one say goodbye
to one's right arm?

01:59:06.747 --> 01:59:09.374
I'm afraid you're gonna wish
you had cut it off sooner.

01:59:13.963 --> 01:59:16.381
I know how terribly fond you are
of Miss Kendall...

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:19.467
I don't find this a terribly attractive...

01:59:22.847 --> 01:59:26.057
- She is not to be trusted.
- You're being mysterious.

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:28.560
I'm not being mysterious at all.

02:00:01.677 --> 02:00:03.678
It couldn't have been anything.

02:00:07.058 --> 02:00:09.809
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

02:00:11.312 --> 02:00:13.980
- And still do.
Rubbish.

02:00:14.398 --> 02:00:16.983
Why else would
you have decided not to tell her...

02:00:17.151 --> 02:00:19.945
...that our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:22.489
You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

02:00:22.657 --> 02:00:24.658
Sometimes the truth
does taste like worms.

02:00:24.825 --> 02:00:27.118
The truth? I've heard nothing
but innuendoes.

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:31.122
Call it my woman's intuition if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:33.708
Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

02:00:33.876 --> 02:00:36.336
She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

02:00:36.504 --> 02:00:39.506
- You were there yourself. You saw it.
Yes.

02:00:41.676 --> 02:00:46.346
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

02:00:48.015 --> 02:00:50.892
A, she removed any doubts
you may have had about her, uh...

02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.853
Now, what did you call it, her devotion?

02:00:54.021 --> 02:00:58.275
B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

02:00:58.442 --> 02:01:01.653
...in case you decided to change your mind.
- You know what I think?

02:01:03.072 --> 02:01:04.572
I think you're jealous.

02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:07.867
No, I mean it,
and I'm very touched. Very...

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:11.913
Leonard!

02:01:19.213 --> 02:01:20.714
The gun she shot Kaplan with.

02:01:21.716 --> 02:01:23.216
I found it in her luggage.

02:01:24.468 --> 02:01:28.221
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own
to show that you're not one of them.

02:01:28.973 --> 02:01:31.850
They've just freshened it up a bit
with blank cartridges.

02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:47.073
What was that noise?

02:01:50.077 --> 02:01:53.330
Yes, we wondered what it was too.
Didn't we, Leonard?

02:01:54.415 --> 02:01:56.374
Hurry, darling. It's almost time to leave.

02:01:56.959 --> 02:01:58.043
In a moment.

02:02:07.261 --> 02:02:09.596
You're not taking her on that plane
with you?

02:02:09.764 --> 02:02:11.056
Of course I am.

02:02:12.099 --> 02:02:15.685
Like our friends,
I too believe in neatness, Leonard.

02:02:15.853 --> 02:02:19.939
This matter is best disposed of
from a great height...

02:02:20.107 --> 02:02:21.608
...over water.

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:10.448
How about a little champagne
before we go?

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:11.991
I'd love it.

02:03:12.159 --> 02:03:15.328
It may not be cold enough.
Over the rocks will be all right.

02:03:15.496 --> 02:03:17.038
Are you sure?

02:03:18.165 --> 02:03:19.416
My dear.

02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:33.239
Thank you.

02:04:33.699 --> 02:04:37.202
To you, my dear, and all
the lovely moments we've had together.

02:04:38.454 --> 02:04:39.996
Thank you, Phillip.

02:04:40.414 --> 02:04:41.581
There he is.

02:04:49.173 --> 02:04:51.758
Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.

02:04:51.926 --> 02:04:53.301
There isn't time.

02:04:53.469 --> 02:04:56.429
You always were a spoilsport,
weren't you?

02:04:56.597 --> 02:05:00.266
One of my most
valuable attributes as it now turns out.

02:05:02.436 --> 02:05:06.439
It would please me if you would think of me
as being along on this journey...

02:05:06.941 --> 02:05:10.527
...if only in spirit.
I shall, Leonard.

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:20.828
He's heading pretty far out
on the north leg and awfully high.

02:05:21.956 --> 02:05:25.208
I guess he's gonna play it safe
with a long, slow descent.

02:05:26.293 --> 02:05:28.503
You couldn't ask
for a better night than this.

02:05:28.671 --> 02:05:31.464
Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.

02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:35.718
Ah, there he goes, starting his turn.

02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:38.304
Well, we better get moving.

02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:43.643
He should have his wheels on the ground
inside of three minutes.

02:05:47.523 --> 02:05:49.941
- Come along, Eve.
All right.

02:05:51.819 --> 02:05:55.488
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.

02:06:08.335 --> 02:06:10.628
We can get out through the window.
There's a car.

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:12.755
What are you doing?
You'll ruin everything.

02:06:12.923 --> 02:06:15.842
They know about the shooting.
They're going to do away with you!

02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:19.345
- What are you talking about?
- Leonard found the gun in your luggage.

02:06:19.513 --> 02:06:22.557
The figure they got at the auction
is filled with microfilm.

02:06:22.725 --> 02:06:25.643
- That's how he's been getting it.
Miss Kendall?

02:06:26.186 --> 02:06:28.146
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane.

02:06:35.779 --> 02:06:38.615
Don't worry, Anna.
Arrangements have been made.

02:06:38.782 --> 02:06:41.784
You and your husband will be
over the Canadian border by morning.

02:06:41.952 --> 02:06:43.703
Thank you very much, sir.
- Be careful.

02:06:43.871 --> 02:06:46.456
We will, sir, and God bless you.

02:07:00.137 --> 02:07:02.221
Thank you for everything.
Be careful, now.

02:07:02.389 --> 02:07:05.058
Now, you're not gonna
leave the house until we're...

02:07:05.225 --> 02:07:08.311
I'll wait, sir. I certainly will. Safe journey.

02:07:09.813 --> 02:07:11.522
Thank you very much.

02:07:13.692 --> 02:07:15.068
Bye.

02:07:51.438 --> 02:07:52.772
Stay where you are.

02:08:04.368 --> 02:08:05.868
Sit down.

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:13.626
As soon as the plane leaves,
my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.

02:08:41.655 --> 02:08:43.322
What is it?

02:08:44.324 --> 02:08:45.992
I was wondering about my earrings.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:47.952
They'll turn up.

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:54.917
When you return to New York,
say goodbye to my sister for me.

02:08:55.085 --> 02:08:57.754
And thank her for her superb performance
as Mrs. Townsend.

02:08:57.921 --> 02:09:00.423
I'll do that.
Tell your knife-throwing chum...

02:09:00.591 --> 02:09:01.841
...that I've reassured his wife.

02:09:02.009 --> 02:09:04.010
All right.
- That's about all, Leonard.

02:09:20.068 --> 02:09:22.236
Get that figure back from her.

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:30.203
The housekeeper had me pinned down...

02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:33.039
...before I realized
it was that same silly gun of yours.

02:09:33.207 --> 02:09:35.124
- I see you've got the pumpkin.
- Yes.

02:10:14.164 --> 02:10:16.916
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.

02:10:35.352 --> 02:10:37.144
What do we do?
Climb down.

02:10:37.312 --> 02:10:38.563
We can't.

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:40.773
Here they come. We have no choice.

02:11:30.282 --> 02:11:32.241
Well, if we ever get out of this alive...

02:11:32.409 --> 02:11:34.744
...let's go back to New York
on the train together.

02:11:34.912 --> 02:11:36.329
All right?

02:11:36.496 --> 02:11:38.414
Is that a proposition?

02:11:39.499 --> 02:11:41.334
It's a proposal, sweetie.

02:11:42.502 --> 02:11:45.212
What happened
to the first two marriages?

02:11:45.839 --> 02:11:47.840
My wives divorced me.

02:11:48.008 --> 02:11:51.052
- Why?
- Well, I think they said I led too dull a life.

02:11:51.219 --> 02:11:53.638
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.

02:12:04.024 --> 02:12:05.858
You all right?

02:12:08.362 --> 02:12:10.613
All right, all right.

02:12:15.369 --> 02:12:17.244
Okay. Come on.

02:12:17.412 --> 02:12:19.872
Come on. Come up here.

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:23.334
Come on. Come on. Come on.

02:15:07.374 --> 02:15:10.334
Help. Help me.

02:15:41.575 --> 02:15:42.658
Thank you, sergeant.

02:15:42.826 --> 02:15:45.870
That wasn't very sporting,
using real bullets?

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:47.705
Here, reach. Now.

02:15:48.748 --> 02:15:51.083
- I'm trying.
- Come on, I've got you.

02:15:51.251 --> 02:15:53.669
- Up.
- I can't make it.

02:15:53.837 --> 02:15:55.546
Yes, you can. Come on.

02:15:55.714 --> 02:15:58.716
- Pull harder.
- Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.

02:16:02.929 --> 02:16:07.433
- Oh. Roger, this is silly.
- I know, but I'm sentimental.
