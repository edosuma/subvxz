WEBVTT

00:17.434 --> 00:21.605
So our work on Venus showed us
that the universe is full of surprises.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.274
Life could exist
in ways that we don't expect.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.070
Which means we can consider places
we might not have tried before.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.655
So, what's next?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.703
Lunchtime!

00:37.371 --> 00:39.498
There's no time for that.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.583
There's always time for lunch.

00:41.667 --> 00:45.003
How are we supposed to find life
on an empty stomach?

00:46.088 --> 00:49.633
<i>Sally's right. I have observed
that humans have a hard time focusing</i>

00:49.716 --> 00:51.969
<i>if they're not fed at regular intervals.</i>

00:55.681 --> 00:56.723
Point taken.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.977
<i>Remember, NASA is a big campus.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:03.564
<i>So make sure you know
where you're going before you set out.</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:09.111
<i>Hello? Anybody? I have a map here.</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:19.371
The cafeteria is this way.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.963
It's in this building right here.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.221
Here it is. I think.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.522
This is one weird-looking cafeteria,
big brother.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.941
Charlie Brown,

01:48.025 --> 01:49.610
make sure the door doesn't

01:50.110 --> 01:51.195
shut.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.575
"Launching HERA mission"?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.535
Wait. Mission?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.786
Launching?

01:59.870 --> 02:01.163
I can't go to space!
I can't go to space!

02:01.246 --> 02:02.873
I don't have my toothbrush.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.673
Not all of us went
through astronaut training, Snoopy.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.384
I just learned how to tie my shoes.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.224
Okay. Let's stay calm.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.644
Everyone, find a station.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.231
Country? Smooth jazz?

02:27.314 --> 02:29.399
What does everyone feel like listening to?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.570
My shoelace is caught.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.577
Everyone in position?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.537
Check.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.704
- Yep.
- Uh-huh.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.872
Yep.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.290
No.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.257
According to this,
we're already out of Earth's atmosphere.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.885
But our feet are on the ground
like there's still gravity.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.855
Yes, we can all see
that gravity is working.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.901
<i>There you are.</i>

03:12.985 --> 03:15.821
- We didn't mean to launch.
- Charlie Brown locked the door.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.657
- We were just hungry.
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

03:18.740 --> 03:20.409
<i>You're not in space.</i>

03:20.492 --> 03:22.578
<i>You're in NASA's HERA simulator.</i>

03:22.661 --> 03:24.872
Simulator? What's that?

03:24.955 --> 03:28.125
<i>A simulator lets us pretend
to be in a situation,</i>

03:28.208 --> 03:30.460
<i>so we can see how people react.</i>

03:30.544 --> 03:35.424
<i>This simulator is NASA's
Human Exploration and Research Analog,</i>

03:35.507 --> 03:36.884
<i>or HERA,</i>

03:36.967 --> 03:40.637
<i>which studies the unique challenges
of long-term space flight,</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:44.641
<i>like being in very close quarters
with other astronauts,</i>

03:44.725 --> 03:47.769
<i>far from Earth for long periods of time.</i>

03:47.853 --> 03:49.479
<i>We also want to see how astronauts</i>

03:49.563 --> 03:52.900
<i>will cooperate,
problem-solve and use teamwork…</i>

03:52.983 --> 03:55.360
<i>…over the course of their mission.</i>

03:55.444 --> 03:59.740
Can it simulate how cranky I'll be
if I don't get lunch?

03:59.823 --> 04:03.118
Hey, everyone! I found some food in here.
Hey, everyone! I found some food in here.

04:03.202 --> 04:04.286
- Food!
- I want some!

04:04.369 --> 04:06.288
- I'm so hungry.
- Me too!

04:12.586 --> 04:13.962
It's a little dry.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.343
This is what we get
for listening to Charlie Brown.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.887
<i>Okay, everyone, cheer up.</i>

04:21.970 --> 04:26.016
<i>This is a great opportunity for you
to practice the kind of creative thinking</i>

04:26.099 --> 04:30.312
<i>that might help you find
life outside of Earth. Or find lunch.</i>

04:31.522 --> 04:32.523
<i>Over here.</i>

04:34.149 --> 04:38.320
<i>For this exercise,
everything you need is in this box.</i>

04:38.403 --> 04:39.738
<i>Good luck.</i>

04:43.909 --> 04:45.953
Oh, great. Robot food.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.999
Excuse me, sir,
could you use a little less of the table?

04:51.083 --> 04:55.003
I need space, Marcie.
Miss Othmar says I'm a tactile learner.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.841
Lucy, your elbow is in my face.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.593
Your face is in my elbow.
Your face is in my elbow.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.930
- Come on, everyone. We need to work--
- Does anyone have a wrench?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.475
I'm using it!

05:08.559 --> 05:11.270
Knock it off! You're hurting my ears.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.355
Excuse me.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.608
- But could we maybe--
- Not now. I'm trying to focus!

05:16.692 --> 05:17.734
I need that!

05:17.818 --> 05:19.069
- I had that--
- No, I do!

05:19.152 --> 05:20.571
- That's mine!
- I had that first!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.739
- I called it.
- I had that first!

05:22.823 --> 05:23.824
Quiet!

05:25.284 --> 05:26.702
Quiet!

05:27.911 --> 05:30.873
This exercise is supposed to be
about teamwork,

05:30.956 --> 05:33.834
determination and problem-solving.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.587
If we're ever going to find life
outside of Earth,

05:36.670 --> 05:41.091
we're going to need to work together.
Now is not the time to just give up.

05:42.718 --> 05:46.346
Okay, everyone, my big brother says
we should just give up.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.519
No. That's not what I said at all.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.108
Wait a second.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.613
It almost looks like these go together.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.114
Come on.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.120
I don't believe it.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.249
It still looks like
it's missing something, Charlie Brown.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.635
Yeah!

06:25.219 --> 06:28.013
<i>Congratulations! You've worked together</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:33.727
<i>and combined all your projects
into the final result: a food rehydrator.</i>

06:33.810 --> 06:36.438
Yeah! A what?

06:36.522 --> 06:40.275
<i>A rehydrator adds water back to food,
so you can eat it.</i>

06:40.359 --> 06:44.321
Right. Just like in the kitchen
on the International Space Station.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.781
Let's give it a shot.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.953
It's about time.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.037
- Looks good.
- Wow!

06:52.120 --> 06:54.414
I'm starving.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.753
Yuck.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.923
<i>Well, it is a prototype.</i>

07:05.259 --> 07:07.386
<i>Is someone gonna answer that</i>?

07:07.469 --> 07:09.471
I would, but we're locked in.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.348
<i>That door doesn't have a lock.</i>

07:11.431 --> 07:13.851
<i>That would be unsafe in an emergency.</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:16.728
I tried pushing on the door,
but it didn't work.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.814
<i>Did you try pulling?</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:22.442
Charlie Brown.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.531
Pizza!

07:27.614 --> 07:30.033
Snoopy, you ordered pizza for us?

07:36.832 --> 07:38.041
Thanks, pal.

07:42.379 --> 07:47.050
<i>To celebrate your successful HERA mission,
let's take a crew photo.</i>

07:47.134 --> 07:49.720
- <i>Say, "HERA."</i>
- HERA!
