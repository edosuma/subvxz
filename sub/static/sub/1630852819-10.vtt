-Okay, all right.

09:35.536 --> 09:37.072
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:37.072 --> 09:39.076
Yeah, I am not equipped
to deal with this.

09:39.076 --> 09:40.847
I'm supposed to be on a hike.
I hate hiking,

09:40.847 --> 09:43.819
but it is better
than this garbage. Also,

09:43.819 --> 09:45.556
your ahi tuna cones are bad.

09:45.556 --> 09:47.927

get food poisoning.

want to look into that.

-Yes, congratulations.

10:13.078 --> 10:15.717
-Yeah. Yeah, uh, this
is exciting, isn't it?
-Yeah.

10:15.717 --> 10:17.487
This will be epic.

10:17.487 --> 10:20.425
You know, what will happen?
Thank you.

10:20.425 --> 10:22.597
Hopefully, we'll get started
soon, but you know women

10:22.597 --> 10:24.701
and their hair and makeup,
so... they...

10:24.701 --> 10:27.874
Well, 'cause... th-they
make it look really nice,

10:27.874 --> 10:29.477
-is what I...
is what I mean, so...
-Yes, yes, yes.

10:29.477 --> 10:32.316
I-I have some eyeliner on
as well, yes.

10:32.316 --> 10:34.353
Makes the eyes pop a bit, yeah.

10:34.353 --> 10:36.859
-Yeah. Thank you.
-So, Joel, what...

10:38.027 --> 10:40.533
-Good champagne.
-What really is the holdup?

10:40.533 --> 10:42.804
-You can tell us.
-She's just a perfectionist,

10:42.804 --> 10:44.674
you know? So...

10:44.674 --> 10:47.246
I'm sure she's working
on her vows.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.416
That's-that's what it is.
The vows.

10:50.686 --> 10:52.891
And, you know, I think
they're serving the wrong apps.

10:52.891 --> 10:55.095
It's supposed to be meatballs.
(short chuckle)

10:55.095 --> 10:58.201
Oh! Uh, there's Aunt Teresa
and her roommate Gwen.

10:58.201 --> 11:02.009

for the hookup?

Yeah, sorry.
That's not my MO today.

we would really get along.

11:53.211 --> 11:54.514
Seriously?

11:54.514 --> 11:57.252
Yeah.

11:57.252 --> 11:59.290
I was gonna play it cool

11:59.290 --> 12:00.726
and wait until
after the ceremony,

12:00.726 --> 12:03.197
but it is taking a hot minute.

you want to know which uncle's

There's two of 'em.
One you'd expect,

12:15.288 --> 12:18.495

-Oh, wow.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.133

You.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.872
You horrible girl from
the bridal shop. I need you.

actually, so...

Hi.

12:40.005 --> 12:41.207
Big day.

12:41.207 --> 12:43.411
Yup.
There's a wedding

12:43.411 --> 12:45.215
-that's supposed to happen.
-(sighs)

12:45.215 --> 12:47.386
So, um...

12:47.386 --> 12:49.791
So, what's going on?
Is it jitters?

12:49.791 --> 12:51.895
'Cause if it is,
you know, Joel is...

12:51.895 --> 12:55.135
Joel's a great guy.
He's...

12:55.135 --> 12:57.072
He's so, um...

12:57.072 --> 12:59.911
boy-boyish and...

12:59.911 --> 13:02.315
he's great with wood.

-And...
-(giggles)

13:04.286 --> 13:06.424
Yeah, he's a sweet, lovely human

13:06.424 --> 13:08.896
who's great with w...

13:08.896 --> 13:12.169
-Wood.
-Okay, I didn't mean it like
that, but if we're honest...

13:13.204 --> 13:14.541
Whatever you're building up
in your head...

13:14.541 --> 13:17.212
Is Joel who you thought
I'd end up with?

13:19.684 --> 13:20.953
No.

13:20.953 --> 13:22.623
No, for a variety of reasons.

13:22.623 --> 13:24.727
But I am, uh... I'm really happy

13:24.727 --> 13:27.567
that you guys are doing this.
You know I mean that.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.004
Um, can you go back
to "no", 'cause...

13:30.004 --> 13:32.409
why did you say no?

13:33.478 --> 13:36.183
Um, I... I don't know.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.289
Joel's... really sweet.

13:39.289 --> 13:41.393
He is.

13:41.393 --> 13:42.930
You're right.

13:42.930 --> 13:45.101
Right? Yeah.
Come on. You're good.

13:45.101 --> 13:46.905
Am I?

13:49.143 --> 13:51.515
Do you think
I should go through with it?

13:53.417 --> 13:54.654
For real?

13:54.654 --> 13:56.457
I'm serious.

13:56.457 --> 13:57.927
I'm lost.

13:58.962 --> 14:02.469
Wow. (chuckles)
Okay. I didn't, uh...

14:02.469 --> 14:04.807
didn't realize this was, like,
a Runaway Bride situation.

14:04.807 --> 14:06.511
-Oh, God.
-Why don't I get Joel?

14:06.511 --> 14:09.349
-No, no.
-Not that. Why don't I...

14:09.349 --> 14:12.590
You know what?
Um... never mind. Thank you.

14:12.590 --> 14:16.531
Uh, can you just... can you go
get Angeline to come in here?

14:19.102 --> 14:21.207
Yeah, sure.

14:21.207 --> 14:23.010
Sorry, I thought
you wanted to see me.

14:23.010 --> 14:26.016
Yeah, no, I know,
it's just, um...

14:26.016 --> 14:28.522
We don't really work like this.

14:28.522 --> 14:31.595
-Like what?
-You know, you're helping me.

14:31.595 --> 14:33.197
It's just... it's not our thing.

14:33.197 --> 14:34.601
Well, historically,

14:34.601 --> 14:36.705
but it could be now, you know?

14:36.705 --> 14:39.409
-I've been doing
a lot of self-work.
-Oh, of course you have.

14:39.409 --> 14:40.679
You're... I mean,
you're good at self-work,

14:40.679 --> 14:42.683
just not other people work.

14:45.221 --> 14:48.528
-Wow. When did this
become about me?
-Oh, Sam,

14:48.528 --> 14:51.200
it's always about you.
Can you just...

14:51.200 --> 14:52.503
Can you go?

14:53.538 --> 14:55.041
Mm-hmm.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.544
Totally, yep.

14:56.544 --> 15:00.051
Just... just trying to step up
to the plate, you know?

15:00.051 --> 15:01.855
Be a better friend to you.

15:01.855 --> 15:03.257
You've always been
a really good friend

15:03.257 --> 15:04.994
-to me.
-I haven't been a good friend.

15:04.994 --> 15:06.765
Okay?

15:06.765 --> 15:09.570
I mean, you just... you need me
to be a good person

15:09.570 --> 15:12.042
because
if I approve of you, then...

15:12.042 --> 15:14.446
that means that
you're good too, right?

15:14.446 --> 15:16.383
But honestly,
just knock yourself out,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.054
'cause I'm a piece of shit.
Just... just tell me

15:18.054 --> 15:19.857
-I'm a piece of shit.
-Oh, my God. Listen,

15:19.857 --> 15:22.930
yes, I was upset when I first
found out about you and Joel.

15:22.930 --> 15:24.634
Duh. But I...

15:24.634 --> 15:26.136
We all did our things,

15:26.136 --> 15:27.405
-right?
-I hooked up with Joel

15:27.405 --> 15:28.709
at your dad's shiva,

15:28.709 --> 15:31.046
Okay? I just...
That's when we got together.

15:31.046 --> 15:33.050
When your dad died.

15:36.758 --> 15:38.528
Can you go now, please?
Because I'm tired

15:38.528 --> 15:40.566
of being the good person.
It's your turn now.

15:42.068 --> 15:43.705
Mm.

15:43.705 --> 15:45.108

Look who we found. He...
-(indistinct chatter)

15:53.659 --> 15:56.732
He's adorable,
but a little odd.

15:56.732 --> 15:58.301
Uh-huh.
Yeah, he's the best.

15:58.301 --> 16:00.038
Um, I actually need to steal him
for a second.

16:00.038 --> 16:01.976
-James.
-Oh. Okay.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.600
-So, yes, we need to go.
-Oh.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.571
Okay. Yeah, yeah, no problem.
I've just been chilling here,

16:07.571 --> 16:09.976
talking to various people,
charming babies, you know.

16:09.976 --> 16:11.880
Yeah, I just, like,
I can't be at this wedding.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.851
You know, I feel like I'm gonna
barf, like, at any moment.

16:13.851 --> 16:15.922
-It's just a matter of time.
-Oh.

16:15.922 --> 16:18.393
-Oh, yeah, no, no,
let's get out of here.
-Thank you.

16:18.393 --> 16:19.830
You're so pretty.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.415
Have you been drinking?

16:30.450 --> 16:31.753
No, no.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.899
Okay, I got a little nervous
and I had...

16:37.899 --> 16:39.135
one drink.

16:39.135 --> 16:41.774
Um...

16:41.774 --> 16:45.447
there's no such thing
as one drink with us.

16:45.447 --> 16:47.217
You know that.

16:47.217 --> 16:49.221
Oh, my God.

16:55.634 --> 16:57.371
Sam.

16:57.371 --> 16:59.341
Sam, Sam, hey, hey.
Hey.

16:59.341 --> 17:01.345
-Come on. Don't leave like this.
-No.

17:01.345 --> 17:02.882
-I did all the stuff, okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:02.882 --> 17:04.618
-I followed the rules, right?
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:04.618 --> 17:06.289
We were in this thing together
and now it can't happen.

17:06.289 --> 17:07.558
-We can't happen.
-Yes it can.

17:07.558 --> 17:08.794
-No.
-It can.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.263
I'll go to Club 24/7 tomorrow,

17:10.263 --> 17:11.365
raise my hand as a newcomer,

17:11.365 --> 17:12.634
-we'll be fine.
-A newcomer? Yeah,

17:12.634 --> 17:14.773
you are a newcomer, okay?
This-- like, me and you--

17:14.773 --> 17:16.242
-it can't happen now.
-Listen,

17:16.242 --> 17:18.513
I'm not as strong as you.
I took a bite

17:18.513 --> 17:20.684
out of the apple,
I was just... It happens.

17:20.684 --> 17:22.321
Doesn't make me a bad person.

17:22.321 --> 17:23.924
I didn't say
you were a bad person.

17:23.924 --> 17:26.229
Well, it kind of
feels like that. You know?

17:26.229 --> 17:28.099
Like, you're the one
that brought me to this thing.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.735
Knowing that
it could be triggering.

17:29.735 --> 17:31.874
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know what to do.

17:31.874 --> 17:33.109
-You can help me.
-Okay.

17:33.109 --> 17:34.478
Let's go to a meeting right now.

17:34.478 --> 17:35.982
Let's go tomorrow, right?

17:35.982 --> 17:39.054
Let's go after.
Let's go back inside,

17:39.054 --> 17:40.757
make a night out of it.
You know,

17:40.757 --> 17:42.896
it was just a slip,
don't worry about it.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.966
Want me to slip, too?

17:46.002 --> 17:48.106
No, no, I...

17:48.106 --> 17:50.110
I'm just saying this sucks.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.349
You know?
Let's go have fun.

17:53.349 --> 17:55.353
You don't deserve that.
You deserve fun,

17:55.353 --> 17:57.859
-let's go have fun.
-I can't, I can't, I...

17:57.859 --> 17:59.762
I worked too hard for this.
I can't.

17:59.762 --> 18:01.599
Listen, listen, Sam...

18:04.471 --> 18:05.975
S... I love you.

18:08.613 --> 18:10.417

19:11.272 --> 19:13.977
Are you okay?
What-what happened?

19:13.977 --> 19:16.282
It's, um...

19:16.282 --> 19:19.521
It's been a day
with some difficult choices.

19:20.925 --> 19:22.127
Oh, Brit.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.931
Oh, you bailed on the wedding.

19:23.931 --> 19:25.901
Honestly, it's, like,
not a great look,

19:25.901 --> 19:27.270
but I think it's gonna be fine.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.208
You know, there's no rule
that says, like, you have to

19:29.208 --> 19:31.245
marry someone just 'cause
you said you would, and...

19:31.245 --> 19:34.084
You'll be fine. It's gonna be
crappy for a while, probably,

19:34.084 --> 19:36.155
-but I think you'll bounce back.
I mean, you're...
-Sam.

19:36.155 --> 19:40.330
It's worse now 'cause
I went through with it.

19:40.330 --> 19:42.000
I'm married.

19:43.002 --> 19:45.340
I'm married.

19:45.340 --> 19:47.344
(crying, laughing)

19:49.648 --> 19:52.220
Okay.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.689
Oh, my God.

19:53.689 --> 19:54.959
Oh, boy.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.796
(sobbing)

19:56.796 --> 19:58.766
