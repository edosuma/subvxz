00:17.399 --> 00:21.611
<i>It's our hope that this material
may one day help us fight the Goa'uld.</i>

00:21.518 --> 00:23.559
- What is it?
- Trinium.

00:23.599 --> 00:27.928
Captain Conner and SG-11 discovered it
on a routine exploratory mission...

00:27.878 --> 00:29.503
...on planet PXY-887.

00:29.557 --> 00:31.385
<i>I've heard about this.</i>

00:31.437 --> 00:35.482
It's supposed to be 100 times lighter
and stronger than steel.

00:35.438 --> 00:40.563
That's raw Trinium, which is too brittle for
manufacturing because of its impurities.

00:40.476 --> 00:45.518
We commissioned SG-11 to extract
more Trinium samples from the planet.

00:45.435 --> 00:50.561
As of this morning they are 48 hours
overdue for the weekly check-in.

00:50.475 --> 00:52.515
It's time to find out why.

00:52.554 --> 00:54.926
Any indigenous people on the planet?

00:54.954 --> 00:58.073
Not according to a preliminary sweep
by the UAV.

00:58.073 --> 01:01.573
- Well, it is a big planet, sir.
- True enough.

01:01.554 --> 01:05.254
Conner's people have only scouted
within a few miles of the base camp.

01:05.233 --> 01:09.018
They picked up no radio traffic,
EM signatures.

01:08.992 --> 01:12.609
<i>No sign of any indigenous life at all.</i>

01:12.591 --> 01:13.871
<i>Incoming traveller!</i>

01:13.950 --> 01:17.569
- SG-11's returning.
- Better be a damn good explanation!

01:35.908 --> 01:38.743
<i>- Everyone all right?
- Uh...</i>

01:39.587 --> 01:40.998
No.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.265
Nope.

01:42.347 --> 01:43.972
No.

01:50.385 --> 01:52.628
Oh... God...

02:57.735 --> 02:59.776
<i>Hi, kids.</i>

02:59.817 --> 03:03.186
We're about ready to ship out, sir.
You gonna be OK?

03:03.175 --> 03:05.168
I'm not dead, Captain.

03:05.215 --> 03:07.254
Just grounded for a few days.

03:07.294 --> 03:11.424
- If the bulletproof glass hadn't slowed it...
- Oh, please.

03:11.375 --> 03:15.158
- Aliens are always pokin' me full of holes.
- Right.

03:15.133 --> 03:18.834
You may like to know that the arrow
was Native North American,...

03:18.813 --> 03:20.640
...but of advanced design.

03:20.693 --> 03:25.022
Our preliminary tests show
it was made of pure forged Trinium.

03:24.971 --> 03:29.634
If Native Americans are on this planet,
they've come a long way technologically.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.776
And we just marched in
and started mining.

03:34.370 --> 03:36.492
I've just talked to the Pentagon.

03:36.530 --> 03:39.650
While they're concerned
about finding SG-11,...

03:39.650 --> 03:43.186
...they also want to avoid
further upsetting the indigenous people.

03:43.168 --> 03:46.086
Meaning they don't wanna risk
losing the Trinium.

03:46.088 --> 03:49.921
Your secondary objective
is to negotiate a mining treaty with them.

03:49.888 --> 03:54.099
Obviously we started our relations
on the wrong foot.

03:54.046 --> 03:56.004
But that's so rare, sir.

03:57.888 --> 04:01.588
Captain, as you are taking over command
of SG-1 on this mission,...

04:01.567 --> 04:05.516
...my superiors have ordered me
to remind you to be diplomatic.

04:05.486 --> 04:07.194
Yes, sir.

04:07.246 --> 04:09.453
Just as I would be.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.085
SG-1, you have a go.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.754
- Sam?
- Colonel?

04:22.803 --> 04:24.630
First command.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.475
Cool.

04:27.523 --> 04:30.809
- I'll do my best, sir.
- I know you will, Captain.

04:30.802 --> 04:32.759
Thanks.

05:00.557 --> 05:03.559
<i>Captain Carter,
I am outside the blasting site.</i>

05:03.557 --> 05:06.512
<i>It appears deserted.
I will investigate further.</i>

05:06.516 --> 05:08.759
Affirmative. At location now.

05:18.754 --> 05:20.747
Ugh!

05:20.795 --> 05:23.202
Coffee's boiled dry.

05:25.673 --> 05:30.252
".. currently extracting an average
of 47Ibs of Trinium ore per day."

05:30.192 --> 05:35.437
"To increase our production fourfold,
as the engineers have requested, a..."

05:35.351 --> 05:40.348
It's a requisition request from Captain
Conner. He just stops in mid-sentence.

05:40.271 --> 05:44.055
Looks like they all stopped
what they were doing and just left.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.538
I found no sign of struggle
at the blast site.

05:47.550 --> 05:51.418
However, a pair of footprints
led me to two separate detonators.

05:51.391 --> 05:54.177
The first had been discharged.
The second had not.

05:54.189 --> 05:57.641
So SG-11 was taken by surprise
before the second charge went off.

05:57.629 --> 06:01.923
My first conclusion, but there were
no footprints leading away from the mine.

06:01.869 --> 06:04.704
It is as if they disappeared
where they were standing.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.776
Creepy.

06:27.105 --> 06:29.146
I am certain I heard something.

06:32.904 --> 06:36.487
- Ghosts?
- Jaffa do not believe in such things.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.706
Let's find something more tangible.

06:54.261 --> 06:56.300
Captain Carter!

07:22.255 --> 07:25.459
Trinium. Just like the arrow.

07:28.576 --> 07:31.327
Can you interpret it, Daniel?

07:32.255 --> 07:34.711
It's, uh, a clan crest.

07:34.735 --> 07:38.485
I believe akin to the style
of the CentraI Coast Salish Indians.

07:38.454 --> 07:39.865
It tells of their origin.

07:39.935 --> 07:44.264
This one tells of how they were brought
here from a distant planet by evil rulers.

07:44.213 --> 07:48.675
Now, according to this figure, the evil
rulers were Jaffa, taking them from Earth.

07:48.613 --> 07:51.531
So this was once a Goa'uld planet?

07:51.533 --> 07:55.911
Well, according to the crest,
the Goa'uld were destroyed by Xe-Is,...

07:55.851 --> 07:58.177
...who has protected them ever since.

07:59.891 --> 08:03.141
- Xe-Is?
- He's the Salish's main spirit.

08:03.130 --> 08:07.959
On Earth he's benevolent traditionally
and represented by this raven figure.

08:12.130 --> 08:13.673
What?

08:17.928 --> 08:19.755
A wolf.

08:22.687 --> 08:24.562
There!

08:30.968 --> 08:32.961
It was there.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.769
- I heard that.
- Me, too.

08:37.846 --> 08:39.673
Teal'c?

08:39.725 --> 08:41.552
Uh...

09:33.717 --> 09:35.426
Whoa!

09:35.476 --> 09:36.508
Hi.

09:36.596 --> 09:38.838
We were just stretching our legs.

09:43.356 --> 09:47.687
If we're prisoners, it's a good sign
that Conner and SG-11 are, too.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.880
This dwelling makes an odd prison.

10:00.913 --> 10:02.952
I don't know.

10:05.153 --> 10:08.106
These walls are made of
a flexible Trinium fibre.

10:08.113 --> 10:12.277
I'll bet it's waterproof
and it is incredibly strong.

10:12.231 --> 10:15.932
It's amazing. They've managed
to evolve technologically,...

10:15.912 --> 10:18.698
...yet essentially maintain
their way of living.

10:18.711 --> 10:22.661
Yet we have observed no facilities
for manufacturing.

10:22.630 --> 10:25.917
There should be
visual indications of processing.

10:25.909 --> 10:30.288
Well, the Salish on Earth are migratory,
depending on the season, so...

10:32.788 --> 10:35.659
I wonder how far we are
from the mining camp.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.707
Couple of days' walk.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.133
I am Tonane.

10:41.187 --> 10:45.138
- Captain Samantha Carter. SGC.
- Long name.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.602
- OK. How about Sam?
- Sam.

10:49.586 --> 10:53.251
Uh, these are my friends.
Dr. Daniel Jackson...

10:53.226 --> 10:54.601
Doc?

10:54.664 --> 10:58.081
- Daniel is fine.
- I am Teal'c.

10:58.065 --> 11:00.900
The spirits say you have
a demon inside you, Teal'c.

11:00.904 --> 11:04.820
The demon will cause you no harm.
I give you my word.

11:04.784 --> 11:07.537
Normally that would mean
a great deal to me.

11:07.543 --> 11:11.128
But how do I know the value
of your word? We have only just met.

11:11.102 --> 11:13.345
We mean you no harm, Tonane.

11:13.383 --> 11:16.134
If you mean us no harm,
why did you bring weapons?

11:16.143 --> 11:19.807
Self-defence. Our friends are missing.
We need to find them.

11:19.782 --> 11:21.940
They're with the spirits.

11:21.981 --> 11:25.481
- Wh... You mean dead?
- No, no, no.

11:25.461 --> 11:27.418
With the spirits.

11:27.461 --> 11:29.500
Oh! The... spirits.

11:31.221 --> 11:34.506
- You don't know the spirits, Sam?
- Oh, we know the spirits.

11:34.499 --> 11:36.990
We definitely know the spirits.

11:37.019 --> 11:41.231
But there's so many in the forest.
Specifically which spirits are they with?

11:41.178 --> 11:44.298
Xe-Is probably. Maybe T'akaya.

11:44.298 --> 11:47.301
Are we prisoners?

11:47.298 --> 11:49.919
No. You're free to go.

11:51.298 --> 11:53.337
Can we have our weapons back?

11:53.376 --> 11:55.536
OK.

12:01.216 --> 12:03.672
One more thing, Tonane. Our friends.

12:04.655 --> 12:10.445
We were returning from our winter camp
and saw your friends trying to take the Ke.

12:10.335 --> 12:14.284
- Ke? Trinium?
- Yeah! That's what your friend called it.

12:14.254 --> 12:15.961
After Xe-Is took your friends,...

12:16.013 --> 12:19.465
...he told me to shoot an arrow
through the Circle of Standing Water...

12:19.453 --> 12:22.455
...as a warning to your kind.
I guess you didn't understand.

12:22.452 --> 12:25.455
Oh, no, we understood,
but, warning or no warning,...

12:25.451 --> 12:27.575
...we don't abandon our friends.

12:27.611 --> 12:32.404
I could introduce you to Xe-Is and we
could tell him it was a misunderstanding.

12:32.331 --> 12:35.084
So you'll take us to where our friends are?

12:35.091 --> 12:38.258
I don't know where your friends are,
but Xe-Is will.

12:40.809 --> 12:43.217
Wouldn't hurt to ask, right, Sam?

12:43.249 --> 12:45.076
Right.

12:47.849 --> 12:51.135
Clearly Tonane is blaming the spirits
for his actions.

12:51.128 --> 12:52.538
Well, clearly,...

12:52.607 --> 12:56.855
...but if this is the only way
to get back SG-11, then I say we let him.

13:14.764 --> 13:18.809
<i>Look, wherever we're going,
there may be a ceremony of some kind.</i>

13:18.764 --> 13:21.220
They might even ask you to dance.

13:21.244 --> 13:24.945
But whatever it is,
no matter how ridiculous it may seem,...

13:24.923 --> 13:27.000
...just try to go along with it.

13:28.123 --> 13:30.246
Don't worry.

13:30.283 --> 13:33.485
Tonane! Uh, I was wondering...

13:33.481 --> 13:38.227
How is it that you remove the impurities
from the Ke so that it won't crumble?

13:39.081 --> 13:43.661
Well, first we ask the spirits
to ask the mountain for the Ke.

13:43.601 --> 13:47.302
If the mountain is in a good mood,
they drop the Ke in the river.

13:48.639 --> 13:52.259
The river cleans the Ke until it's shiny.

13:52.240 --> 13:56.818
And then we take it out of the river
and shape it into whatever we need.

13:57.798 --> 13:59.043
Oh.

14:01.437 --> 14:04.605
<i>Xe-Is! T'akaya!</i>

14:06.037 --> 14:11.078
<i>Wait. You're not going to perform
a ceremoniaI dance or something?</i>

14:10.996 --> 14:15.125
My great-great-grandfather
used to call up the spirits that way,...

14:15.076 --> 14:18.528
...but one day Xe-Is just said
"Call my name!"

14:18.515 --> 14:20.554
And that's what we do.

14:29.354 --> 14:31.394
Captain Carter.

14:32.235 --> 14:34.062
T'akaya, my friend.

14:34.113 --> 14:36.272
My, your coat shines beautifully today.

14:38.352 --> 14:40.808
A little flattery couldn't hurt, Sam.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.938
My, what big eyes you have.

14:47.312 --> 14:49.350
Ask her about your friends.

14:52.669 --> 14:54.081
T'akaya...

14:58.509 --> 15:01.427
Do you think our friends might be...?

15:08.827 --> 15:13.288
- She's right there!
- I can only see a wolf, Tonane.

15:13.226 --> 15:17.272
A... beautiful animal, granted,
but not a spirit.

15:18.866 --> 15:22.235
You can't see the wind either, Sam,
but you know it's there.

15:22.225 --> 15:25.890
You can hear it, you can feel it.

15:25.865 --> 15:29.911
You can see its effects on the trees.

15:29.865 --> 15:31.904
It's the same with the spirits.

15:31.943 --> 15:33.854
You see a wolf,...

15:33.903 --> 15:35.943
...but T'akaya is there.

15:41.062 --> 15:43.019
Tonane, is... is that Xe-Is?

15:43.063 --> 15:45.102
Yes, it is, Daniel.

15:48.701 --> 15:50.528
Xe-Is...

15:54.302 --> 15:56.129
We mean you and Tonane no harm.

15:56.182 --> 15:59.846
We apologise for any misunderstanding
you've had with our friends.

16:01.700 --> 16:05.485
If you would release them,
we'd be very grateful.

16:07.779 --> 16:10.022
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

16:10.058 --> 16:13.226
I'm almost sure
that he said he would release them.

16:13.219 --> 16:15.841
I believe I heard it also.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.538
Is that what you heard, Sam?

16:19.577 --> 16:22.864
<i>Uh, what I heard was a little different.</i>

16:24.937 --> 16:28.769
I thought I heard him say he would
think about it and then get back to us.

16:28.736 --> 16:32.735
<i>- Right. That's what I heard.
- Are you sure? He just...</i>

16:32.695 --> 16:37.572
Daniel, forget it.
Let's just let the bird think about it.

16:37.495 --> 16:40.615
Come on. Tonane,
do you mind if we look around a little...

16:40.615 --> 16:43.023
...while Xe-Is is making up his mind?

16:43.053 --> 16:44.880
Fine by me.

16:44.934 --> 16:46.975
Xe-Is will catch up to us.

17:09.650 --> 17:12.651
<i>Well, that was fast.</i>

17:12.650 --> 17:15.817
Uh... I'm sorry. I missed that one.

17:18.169 --> 17:20.209
Xe-Is has granted your request.

17:21.768 --> 17:24.259
Your friends will be released.

17:24.288 --> 17:26.445
Did he say when?

17:26.488 --> 17:28.527
Captain Carter.

17:51.085 --> 17:52.709
Captain Carter?

17:55.604 --> 17:58.059
How does it feel to see the wind, Sam?

18:06.481 --> 18:09.152
So where have you been
for the last 48 hours?

18:09.162 --> 18:11.201
I... can't say.

18:11.241 --> 18:15.490
Last thing I remember, I was writing
a requisition for more blasting caps.

18:15.440 --> 18:19.568
Next thing I know, I'm walking out
of this mist, and there you are.

18:20.361 --> 18:23.528
- And that's it?
- Yes.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.848
Except my head feels like
I just got back from a three-day pass.

18:27.798 --> 18:31.334
- We must have been drugged.
- As were we.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.357
Hello, Cap.

18:33.397 --> 18:35.686
Still smiling, I hope.

18:35.718 --> 18:37.128
You...

18:37.198 --> 18:39.237
Whoa! Tonane.

18:39.278 --> 18:42.362
Captain, this is Tonane. He's our friend.

18:42.356 --> 18:45.108
He said he asked you to stop blasting.
Is that true?

18:45.115 --> 18:49.030
Yes, he did,
but we'd already set two hot charges.

18:48.996 --> 18:52.412
I told him to wait until after the blast,
then we'll talk.

18:52.394 --> 18:54.304
He just walked away.

18:54.355 --> 18:58.732
OK. It's not so important right now.
We can save it for the report.

18:58.674 --> 19:01.509
Tonane, perhaps
we could have that conversation...

19:01.513 --> 19:04.597
...that Captain Conner
should have had with you earlier.

19:04.593 --> 19:08.045
- About taking the Ke from the mountain?
- Yes.

19:08.032 --> 19:11.817
That's not up to me, Sam.
You have to ask the elders of my village.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.231
I am sorry.

19:21.270 --> 19:24.391
We understand, Sam,
that you have no ill intentions,...

19:24.391 --> 19:26.762
...that you only wish to extract the Ke.

19:27.949 --> 19:31.484
But your methods
are wastefuI and violent.

19:31.469 --> 19:36.463
They not only upset our people,...
but our spirits.

19:43.107 --> 19:48.103
Why can you not be content with the Ke
that the spirits send down the river?

19:48.027 --> 19:51.111
Our people may need more
than the river can provide.

19:51.106 --> 19:54.060
But we don't wish to shorten your supply.

19:54.066 --> 19:57.400
We do have other mining methods
that are less destructive.

20:01.825 --> 20:06.154
Perhaps Tonane could return with you
through the Circle of Standing Water...

20:06.104 --> 20:08.144
...and see these methods.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.359
Uh, yeah. That's a solution. Um...

20:11.384 --> 20:15.760
Have any of your people
ever travelled through the circle before?

20:19.221 --> 20:21.261
The spirits say it's too dangerous.

20:21.301 --> 20:23.340
Can't be that dangerous.

20:23.382 --> 20:25.421
They're alive.

20:25.461 --> 20:27.501
And I love to travel.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.689
Great. Then it's settled.

20:36.540 --> 20:39.826
So the elders agreed
to allow Tonane to come back...

20:39.818 --> 20:43.105
...and observe our alternative
mining methods, and here we are.

20:43.099 --> 20:45.590
Sounds like fun. Sorry I missed it.

20:45.618 --> 20:47.777
- Good job, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

20:47.818 --> 20:50.441
- How's the...?
- Fine. Fine.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.874
I thought you were gonna show me
your mining methods, George.

20:53.857 --> 20:56.775
We intend to,
but first you need a brief medical exam.

20:56.778 --> 20:57.808
George?

20:59.776 --> 21:02.231
Tonane, this is Colonel Jack O'Neill.

21:02.256 --> 21:05.756
- Jack?
- Yeah, that'll do.

21:05.736 --> 21:07.775
It's an honour to meet you, sir.

21:10.895 --> 21:14.431
I know it looks strange, Tonane,
but it's completely safe.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.656
Even our people are being examined.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.935
Don't worry, Tonane. It won't hurt.

21:27.532 --> 21:29.571
Stop the images, please.

21:32.491 --> 21:35.612
These ways are as wastefuI
and destructive as the others.

21:35.611 --> 21:39.145
<i>It's only the first part
of the process, Tonane.</i>

21:39.131 --> 21:42.713
Later we restore the land and
replant trees. You haven't seen that yet.

21:42.690 --> 21:45.941
I'm convinced that our way is best.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.970
Your way meaning...

21:48.009 --> 21:53.467
...your spirits ask the mountain
to send the stuff to you down the river?

21:53.368 --> 21:55.409
Yes, Jack.

21:55.449 --> 21:59.910
It's the best way and the only way
we will allow you to take the Ke.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.207
I see.

22:07.767 --> 22:11.634
Perhaps Dr. Jackson would show you
the rest of our facility.

22:11.605 --> 22:14.643
- I'm sure you'll find it interesting.
- Uh, yes.

22:14.644 --> 22:17.848
I'd also like to show you
images of your ancestors.

22:17.845 --> 22:21.131
- Ancestors?
- Oh, yeah. This may come as a shock,...

22:21.125 --> 22:25.871
...but we believe your great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandfather...

22:25.804 --> 22:27.631
...may have come from here.

22:27.683 --> 22:32.061
- From here?
- Um, I'll show you.

22:38.681 --> 22:41.848
Well... His mind's made up.

22:42.641 --> 22:44.681
That's unfortunate.

22:44.721 --> 22:46.798
They are offering to share the Trinium.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.008
Small deposits washed down
from the mountain over centuries.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.752
It may be enough
to meet the needs of Tonane's tribe,...

22:52.759 --> 22:55.595
...but not enough
for any practical application.

22:55.599 --> 22:59.930
Therefore I have been ordered
to consider other initiatives.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.248
- Initiatives?
- Nothing sinister, Captain.

23:03.239 --> 23:07.070
The NID has a proposal
before the Pentagon suggesting...

23:07.038 --> 23:11.747
...that, when the Salish migrate south,
we send another SG team to the planet...

23:11.675 --> 23:15.626
...to continue extracting samples
and leave before the Salish return.

23:15.596 --> 23:18.715
- You mean steal it?
- I'm not comfortable with that, sir.

23:18.715 --> 23:20.756
Sir, they set us free last time.

23:20.795 --> 23:25.007
If they caught us mining the mountain
again, they might not be so gracious.

23:24.954 --> 23:30.032
I don't like the idea of lying to
Tonane's people any more than you do.

23:29.954 --> 23:34.498
But the next time the Goa'uld attack,
we might not be so fortunate.

23:34.432 --> 23:39.676
We need whatever military advantages
we can find. If that means Trinium...

23:39.593 --> 23:44.384
Sir, I am all for getting the Trinium,
but there has to be an alternative.

23:44.311 --> 23:47.763
Is anyone at the Pentagon
or along the chain of command...

23:47.751 --> 23:52.000
...remotely concerned about
their aboriginaI rights, repeating history,...

23:51.951 --> 23:54.406
...that annoyingly pesky moral stuff?

23:54.431 --> 23:55.842
That's enough, Colonel.

23:55.910 --> 24:00.904
- With respect, General, I think he's right.
- Yeah, what the hell? Worked before...

24:00.830 --> 24:02.788
I have assurances it will only be...

24:02.828 --> 24:08.073
...a small exploratory operation
with less damage to the mountainside.

24:07.989 --> 24:13.067
Hopefully, what they don't know
won't hurt them. Dismissed.

24:16.787 --> 24:18.412
Sweet.

24:23.467 --> 24:26.135
Colonel, we should go back in there...

24:28.787 --> 24:31.538
- He is very upset.
- Yeah.

24:31.546 --> 24:33.586
So am I.

24:44.144 --> 24:47.015
I had a meeting, Captain.
Was there something else?

24:47.022 --> 24:48.433
Yes, sir.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.621
As I suspected.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.911
They intend to deceive our friend Tonane.

25:03.901 --> 25:08.859
It's time to show the Earthlings
the power of the spirits.

25:27.057 --> 25:28.385
<i>Code nine! Code nine!</i>

25:28.457 --> 25:30.699
<i>Move! Move! Let's go!</i>

25:48.173 --> 25:50.213
Damn it.

25:54.731 --> 25:58.231
Code nine! Code nine!
This is not a drill! I repeat...

25:58.212 --> 26:00.251
<i>Not a drill!</i>

26:02.011 --> 26:04.219
What's that sound mean, Daniel?

26:04.250 --> 26:06.290
Uh, it means that...

26:08.971 --> 26:13.718
It means that I'm gonna show you a part
of the base most people rarely get to see.

26:25.328 --> 26:27.570
- Ah! Jesus!
- Sorry, sir.

26:28.167 --> 26:30.576
Are we the only ones
to make it to the armoury?

26:30.607 --> 26:33.894
- Looks like it. Why the code nine?
- Brace yourself.

26:33.886 --> 26:38.465
SG-11 is boppin' around, wavin'
their arms, makin' our people disappear.

26:38.406 --> 26:41.112
- So we did not bring back SG-11?
- I don't think so.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.451
- Where's Tonane?
- With Daniel. Archives.

26:43.486 --> 26:46.356
- Where did the alarm originate?
- The lab.

27:02.042 --> 27:03.537
- Colonel.
- Warner?

27:05.163 --> 27:07.202
Corridors and the other lab are empty.

27:07.241 --> 27:08.950
What happened?

27:09.001 --> 27:11.539
It's Tonane. He came into the infirmary,...

27:11.561 --> 27:14.182
...waved his hand
and made everyone disappear.

27:17.599 --> 27:19.925
I hid.
I pushed the panic button after he left.

27:19.961 --> 27:21.835
What about Conner and his team?

27:21.881 --> 27:25.500
It's Tonane we have to find.
The others are meaningless.

27:29.999 --> 27:32.038
Meaningless?

27:35.558 --> 27:38.015
So, who are you?

27:39.876 --> 27:43.127
Excuse me? Dr. Warner.

27:43.116 --> 27:45.903
I don't... think so.

27:49.436 --> 27:52.307
I am one of Tonane's guardian spirits,...

27:52.316 --> 27:54.272
...Colonel O'Neill.

27:54.316 --> 27:57.269
If you know where he is, take me to him.

27:57.275 --> 28:00.857
Otherwise, if you harm him or myself,...

28:02.074 --> 28:04.910
...your people
will never be returned to you.

28:04.913 --> 28:07.749
We don't respond well to threats.

28:08.952 --> 28:10.577
Neither do we.

28:12.833 --> 28:14.030
Argh!

28:30.390 --> 28:33.723
You... will be... punished.

28:37.827 --> 28:39.904
All right. Let's get him...

28:39.948 --> 28:42.486
<i>.. it... back to the infirmary.</i>

28:55.227 --> 28:57.682
It's all right, airmen. She's with me.

29:08.505 --> 29:11.375
I have lost contact with Xe-Is.

29:11.384 --> 29:14.255
- Has Tonane been found?
- Not yet.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.630
Stay here in the form of the General.

29:18.623 --> 29:20.747
No one is to leave.

29:20.782 --> 29:22.823
I will find Xe-Is and Tonane.

29:24.102 --> 29:26.142
If we lose contact,...

29:27.060 --> 29:29.598
...destroy this place...

29:30.381 --> 29:33.465
...and return home with the others.

29:52.818 --> 29:56.234
Anyway, like I was saying,
this is, uh, a storeroom...

29:56.217 --> 30:02.386
...and the reason we store things is so that
we always have them on hand, like this.

30:02.257 --> 30:04.795
Can I go home now?

30:04.817 --> 30:06.856
OK, Tonane, I won't lie to you.

30:06.895 --> 30:09.221
There is a problem. We have to find Jack.

30:09.256 --> 30:11.213
OK.

30:11.255 --> 30:13.295
He's not in here.

30:13.335 --> 30:14.960
Right.

30:21.094 --> 30:24.011
- Is he gonna be all right?
- It's hard to say, sir.

30:24.012 --> 30:28.391
The only real sign will be when he has
the strength to make us all disappear.

30:31.451 --> 30:33.693
- Jack?
- Daniel?

30:33.731 --> 30:36.354
- Are you you?
- Yeah. You?

30:36.371 --> 30:39.076
- What?
- Never mind.

30:39.090 --> 30:41.333
Tonane, we need to talk.

30:43.411 --> 30:47.824
Daniel says you have some problems.
Maybe I should just go home.

30:47.769 --> 30:49.596
Uh...

30:49.650 --> 30:51.690
...not just yet.

30:52.409 --> 30:57.569
Our people are disappearing all over the
base and it has something to do with you.

30:57.488 --> 31:00.856
Did you know Conner and SG-11
are really aliens?

31:00.847 --> 31:03.256
What are aliens?

31:03.287 --> 31:04.912
Come here.

31:12.566 --> 31:15.104
That is an alien.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.795
It also happens to be one of your spirits.

31:17.806 --> 31:19.845
Probably Xe-Is.

31:20.684 --> 31:23.355
Xe-Is, is that you?

31:28.163 --> 31:31.034
If he was, Jack, he'd probably answer.

31:33.124 --> 31:37.453
In the world of my origin there were
beings who pretended to be gods...

31:37.402 --> 31:40.439
...so they could conquer my people
and rule with fear.

31:40.442 --> 31:43.527
Perhaps that is the way of your spirits.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.326
I feel sorry for your people, Teal'c.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.609
But my spirits aren't evil.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.807
They don't rule us. They protect us.

31:52.799 --> 31:54.544
Tonane.

31:55.878 --> 31:57.752
That is Xe-Is.

31:57.798 --> 32:01.133
And right now
he's trying to conquer this base.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.903
I wanna know why. More importantly,
I wanna know how to stop him.

32:06.877 --> 32:11.125
The spirits I know
wouldn't threaten your people...

32:11.076 --> 32:14.695
...unless you were doing something
to threaten mine.

32:14.676 --> 32:16.715
Are you, Jack?

32:18.675 --> 32:21.048
Because if you are...

32:21.076 --> 32:23.365
...there's no way to stop them.

32:23.394 --> 32:27.724
Xe-Is and T'akaya
and the other spirits...

32:27.675 --> 32:29.714
They'll destroy you.

32:51.310 --> 32:55.855
From what I overheard, they won't destroy
the base until they've found Tonane.

32:55.790 --> 33:01.083
We must convince the aliens we'll make
no more attempts to extract their Trinium.

33:00.990 --> 33:04.823
The fact is we got caught
plotting behind closed doors.

33:04.789 --> 33:08.622
I don't know how we're gonna
convince 'em our word is good for squat.

33:08.588 --> 33:10.628
I mean, my God! We shot that one.

33:10.669 --> 33:14.334
We come across any more,
it won't be a very long conversation.

33:14.307 --> 33:18.306
OK. Well, we can still appeal to the elders.

33:18.268 --> 33:20.509
Tell them what's happened.

33:22.346 --> 33:24.385
You mean... fess up?

33:30.865 --> 33:32.692
Yeah, OK.

33:32.746 --> 33:34.739
You and Teal'c try and gate back.

33:34.785 --> 33:37.655
See if you can get 'em
to speak to the spirits for us.

33:43.223 --> 33:45.050
Tonane.

33:47.502 --> 33:50.374
It's... time for the truth.

33:58.622 --> 34:00.449
No.

34:01.181 --> 34:03.851
Just let me try and talk to her first.

34:03.859 --> 34:05.900
Wait here.

34:13.539 --> 34:15.364
T'akaya.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.954
Before you... make me disappear...

34:18.938 --> 34:20.349
...or bite me,...

34:20.418 --> 34:21.829
...just...

34:23.018 --> 34:25.056
...hear me out.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.782
Wait, wait, wait! I know where Xe-Is is.

34:40.815 --> 34:42.643
Where?

34:43.135 --> 34:44.960
Where is Xe-Is?

34:47.054 --> 34:49.380
Promise to hear me out.

34:53.172 --> 34:57.670
Sir, it's possible he's still suffering
the effects of the zat gun.

34:57.612 --> 34:59.855
I don't think so, Captain.

35:00.492 --> 35:02.947
He just doesn't want to show himself.

35:08.652 --> 35:11.438
- Right!
- No! Jack!

35:11.451 --> 35:13.489
It's OK.

35:15.090 --> 35:17.130
Just let them tend to Xe-Is.

35:21.090 --> 35:23.498
How do I know you're really Daniel?

35:25.648 --> 35:27.440
Because...

35:27.489 --> 35:29.731
Yeah. OK.

35:59.204 --> 36:01.030
Thank you.

36:11.242 --> 36:14.742
- T'akaya, destroy this place.
- Wait!

36:14.722 --> 36:16.880
You promised to listen.

36:16.920 --> 36:21.880
"What they don't know won't hurt them."
Isn't that what your leader said, Colonel?

36:21.800 --> 36:25.085
Their word means nothing.

36:25.081 --> 36:28.367
And so would mine,
if I were to do as you asked.

36:29.599 --> 36:33.347
I have made a promise to this one...

36:33.318 --> 36:35.561
...so that we could save your life.

36:37.878 --> 36:43.121
I am listening, but I do not guarantee your
words will sway me from punishing you.

36:43.036 --> 36:44.661
For what?

36:44.717 --> 36:48.418
For trying to deceive the Salish
and steal our Ke.

36:48.396 --> 36:52.476
And for attempting to destroy
the trust and faith...

36:52.436 --> 36:54.809
...between Tonane's people and my own.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.702
OK.

37:03.273 --> 37:05.730
I give you my word...

37:06.875 --> 37:11.121
...that we'll give up this... mining operation.

37:11.072 --> 37:14.905
Even if we could trust you,...

37:14.871 --> 37:17.956
...your superiors will not be swayed
by your oath.

37:18.873 --> 37:21.197
So don't take my word.

37:21.231 --> 37:23.271
Shut down your Stargate.

37:23.311 --> 37:27.012
That way no one will be able to come
to your planet unless you allow it.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.835
Star travel is of no use to us.

37:35.190 --> 37:37.230
Let us close down the gate.

37:38.188 --> 37:40.858
This does not erase
the second transgression.

37:42.068 --> 37:45.355
What? Exposing who you are to Tonane?

37:45.347 --> 37:48.514
You've been posing as gods,
for heaven's sake!

37:49.347 --> 37:51.885
Is that what you believe we do?

37:52.987 --> 37:56.735
When we removed the Goa'uld
from our planet a millennium ago...

37:56.706 --> 38:00.041
...we adapted our form
to those of the Salish spirits,...

38:00.025 --> 38:04.402
...so that we could protect and
coexist alongside them in harmony...

38:04.344 --> 38:08.260
...without interfering
in their natural evolution.

38:09.744 --> 38:15.036
And now, because of you,
that harmony has been broken.

38:14.943 --> 38:19.902
In time they will fear us and
use the Ke we scatter through the rivers...

38:19.824 --> 38:21.862
...and forge weapons against us.

38:22.862 --> 38:24.273
No.

38:24.342 --> 38:28.007
The Salish people you so honour
came from this world.

38:27.981 --> 38:32.442
Even now they value the natural world
far more than technology.

38:32.380 --> 38:34.420
Trust them.

38:37.099 --> 38:42.605
If you really do respect Tonane's people,
you shouldn't be posing as their spirits.

38:45.179 --> 38:47.005
Trust them.

38:51.177 --> 38:54.878
Our friend Tonane is wise.

38:57.057 --> 38:59.548
And so is our friend Jack.

38:59.577 --> 39:01.617
So he is.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.373
Tonane, Xe-Is.

39:18.414 --> 39:21.250
Xe-Is, Tonane.

39:24.094 --> 39:26.132
So you're Xe-Is.

39:26.813 --> 39:29.483
And I am T'akaya.

39:29.492 --> 39:33.360
We are honoured by the names
your forefathers have given us.

39:33.333 --> 39:36.867
You view us now in our true form.

39:36.851 --> 39:41.762
But this is only one of many forms
we can take.

39:41.690 --> 39:45.474
Our friends from this world call us aliens.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.286
You call us spirits.

39:48.289 --> 39:50.960
From now on, Tonane,...

39:50.969 --> 39:56.510
...you and your people may view us
in the form which pleases you best.

39:56.407 --> 39:59.992
You have always been kind to my people.

40:01.288 --> 40:04.409
So... whatever makes you happy.

40:05.447 --> 40:09.612
I think this form makes us happy.

40:13.246 --> 40:15.286
Does this mean I can go home?

40:17.125 --> 40:18.322
Uh...

40:20.764 --> 40:22.389
Yeah. I think it does.

40:24.563 --> 40:25.762
Goodbye, Jack.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.791
Oh, wait!

40:33.842 --> 40:36.760
Um, what about our friends?

40:36.764 --> 40:39.764
Your friends are right beside you, Daniel.

40:50.521 --> 40:52.561
Colonel O'Neill?

40:54.440 --> 40:56.480
Um...

40:58.400 --> 41:00.440
I'll explain it all later, sir.
