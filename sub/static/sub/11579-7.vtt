00:01.440 --> 00:03.120
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.200 --> 00:06.720
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.800 --> 00:07.880
In New York City,

00:07.920 --> 00:10.720
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.800 --> 00:14.160
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.240 --> 00:15.880
These are their stories,

00:18.160 --> 00:19.640
FRANK: I'II get a cab.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.280
How's it going?
Is it a Iove connection?

00:23.320 --> 00:24.680
I don't think he Iikes me.

00:24.720 --> 00:29.160
That's crazy. You're adorable.
Definitely Steve's type.
Talk to him.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.800
Sorry. I didn't mean...
It's fine. It's all right.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.000
I'm just really nervous.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.840
Me, too.
I think we both need to relax.
I know this great piano bar.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.520
(GUN FIRING)

00:43.600 --> 00:45.800
Get out of here. I'II call.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.040
Hold it!
Let me see your hands!

00:52.800 --> 00:54.280
Now!
Okay.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.520
My name's Phil.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.040
I sleep here.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.880
Detective Nathan?
Steve.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.080
OIivia, this is EIIiot.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.640
Your John Doe's a white male,
early mid-20s.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.200
Caught a slug in the gut.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.560
Crime scene's an alley
off of a bar called Puffy's.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.760
I'm not sure, but I think
I saw the victim inside.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.040
Inside the bar?

01:23.120 --> 01:26.680
I was on a date.
Set up by friends.
Made a great first impression.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.160
Do we suspect a gay bashing?

01:28.240 --> 01:31.080
Can't say for sure.
Victim was gang-raped.
That's why I called you.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.360
Doctors found copious fluids.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
Witness?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.080
Name's Phil Kastner.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.240
Brick chip caught him
in the cheek
from the ricochet.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.720
CIaims he just got there
wanting to bed down.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.160
STABLER: What,
you don't believe him?

01:41.200 --> 01:44.840
Sounds good, but he's pretty
clean for a street sleeper.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.560
Uniforms took him for a meal
but I'II make sure
he gets to the squad.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.600
Okay. Thanks for your help.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.640
You need anything else,
you can reach me at the 25.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.000
Okay. You know, Steve,
if you want
a Iittle discretion on this,

01:53.040 --> 01:54.240
we can try
and keep you out of it.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.520
I don't broadcast,
but the brass already knows.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.080
Thanks for asking, though.
Okay. Take it easy.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.520
BENSON: I'II need
to see the wound, please.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.800
It's an old scar.
Doubt he uses that hand much.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.600
Okay. No other wounds,
no tattoos.
So, just this scar?

02:11.920 --> 02:14.080
Yeah.
And a wedding ring.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.640
Well, if he was
in a committed relationship,

02:15.720 --> 02:17.680
we might be able to get a hit
off Missing Persons.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.280
He's in a meat market bar.
Let's hope his partner's
more committed than he is.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.640 --> 03:13.640
Thanks for the shower
and the clothes.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.240
I do Iaundry on Thursdays,
so I'II wash these
and I'II bring them back.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.640
STABLER: Yours to keep.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.480
No, no, no, no.
I appreciate that
but I've got plenty.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.200
I'II give them to somebody
who needs them.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.960
You a junkie, Phil?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.400
Sugar gave me away, huh?

03:29.480 --> 03:30.720
How Iong you been clean?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.200
Sixty-four days,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.360
five hours, twelve minutes,
six seconds.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.800
Seven, eight, nine...

03:39.960 --> 03:43.280
Sebastian, he's my counselor.
He gave me the watch.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.240
Said I needed to tell time
to know how precious it is.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.680
It's precious agony.
Yeah.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.400
Okay, the alley outside
of Puffy's, is that
where you usually rest?

03:53.480 --> 03:57.320
Yeah. The gays, they treat
me human, so I stay there
when I can't find a bed.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.080
Where do you usually stay?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.960
Mission on 10th
when I'm not in rehab.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.640
You see the shooter, Phil?

04:04.720 --> 04:08.120
It was dark, but I got
a good Iook at him
when he broke the alley.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.520
Brown hair,
between 5'10" and 6 feet.
I didn't see his eyes, though.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.280
You see the gun?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.959
Snub-nose revolver.
Probably a.38.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.160
I was a master sergeant,
Parris Island.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.400
It was a Iifetime ago.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.520
You know, Phil,
veterans are eligible

04:28.560 --> 04:30.600
for Uncle Sam benefits.
You know that, right?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.160
Not without an address.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.440
The waiting Iist for housing,
oh, it's awfully Iong.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.760
How much of this addict's
statement can we believe?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.960
I'd say all of it. He was
Iucid enough for details.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.800
If we find our shooter,
Phil's testimony won't hold up
in court without help.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.080
It's putting the proverbial
cart, don't you think?

04:48.160 --> 04:49.920
Get him to agree
to a blood test.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.080
If his tox screen
shows he's clean now,
the Iawyers can't argue Iater.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.760
Good thing you know
the drug business.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.920
GIad I could bring
something to the table.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.320
I didn't mean that.
Forget it.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.360
Look, get on it before
we Iose Phil to the street.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.440
What's with him?
What's the word
on our John Doe,

05:03.520 --> 05:05.000
and what the hell was he doing
in that alley?

05:05.080 --> 05:08.760
No solicitation, hits.
Vice couldn't ID him
from the photo or the prints,

05:08.840 --> 05:09.960
so he's not a known pro.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.880
Doctors found three different
blood types in the semen.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.600
This Iooks Iike
a rape gang-bang.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.080
Good money's on a hate crime.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.720
Perps are usually hetero,
or closeted and in denial.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.000
Well, there was a ring
on his finger. So, maybe
he's cheating, wanted out.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.840
Picked up the wrong guys
in the meat market.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.200
John, you're on missing
persons.

05:26.280 --> 05:31.080
While you two canvass
that bar, see if our John Doe
introduced himself around.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.200
Looked a hell of a Iot better
than that Iast night.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.960
Did you catch a name?
No. I'm not his type.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.840
Pretty boys tend to
stick together.
Did you see someone with him?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.960
Yeah, one of our regulars,
but he's not into
working guys over.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.520
Well, we'II still
need to talk to him.
This regular have a name?

05:44.560 --> 05:47.840
Being gay doesn't mean
being violent.
Whoever did that was straight.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.680
As a matter of fact,
gay bashers
Iook a Iot Iike you.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.960
Look, we really don't want
a hassle, but this is how
it's gonna play out.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.440
We come back here
with a warrant,
we go through your receipts,

05:57.520 --> 06:00.320
and while we're doing that,
we close down your bar.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.720
Name's Willem. I know him.
He didn't do this.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.040
They had a drink at the bar.
Will passed him
a thick envelope.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.280
Did you see
what was in the envelope?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.960
No, and I didn't overhear
any conversation, either.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.600
Music here gets pretty Ioud.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.600
Did they Ieave together?

06:13.680 --> 06:14.840
Your guy Ieft alone.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.600
Hard to believe,
with a body Iike that.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.000
STABLER:
What about this Willem?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.520
Left at Iast call.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.080
Okay. We'II need to
hear that from him, so,
do you have an address?

06:22.160 --> 06:26.080
No, but you can find one
from the credit card receipts.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.760
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

06:33.720 --> 06:34.800
Yes?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.080
You Willem Mueller?

06:36.160 --> 06:40.200
No. Ray Borland.
Willem's my houseboy.
What's he done this time?

06:40.280 --> 06:42.440
We just need to talk to him.
Is he in?

06:42.480 --> 06:44.240
He's picking up my Iaundry.
What's this about?

06:44.320 --> 06:47.240
Have you ever seen this man
with Mr. Mueller?

06:47.280 --> 06:50.360
No, I haven't. I'm pretty
sure he'II be back soon.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.160
Okay. Have him give us a call
when he comes in.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.080
Thank you, Mr. Borland.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.120
Houseboy?

07:00.840 --> 07:03.680
Guess that's what
they're called these days.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.480
He fits the witness
description.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.920
Willem Mueller? We'd Iike to
talk to you about Iast night.

07:13.320 --> 07:17.080
Seven years in Sing Sing.
Possession with Intent
and assault two.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.880
I've changed my evil ways.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.000
Not in this Iifetime.
Recognize him?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.600
Had a couple drinks. So what?

07:22.680 --> 07:25.320
He was found worked over
in that alley
in more ways than one,

07:25.360 --> 07:27.520
and you were the Iast person
seen with him.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.680
I didn't touch him.
Not even for fun.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.920
What's his name?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.640
Peter Ivanhoe.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.760
That for real?
It's what he said.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.800
What was the envelope for?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.600
I was paying for a job.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.600
What was he running for you,
coke or crystal meth?

07:40.680 --> 07:42.440
Not that kind of job.
I'm out of that business.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.120
Well, what, then?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.640
I plead the fifth.
He pleads the fifth.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.960
You're not on trial.
BENSON: Yet.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.800
Terence Moore,
representing Mr. Mueller,

07:49.840 --> 07:51.840
who is done talking
unless you're charging him.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.520
He's free to go
after we get his DNA.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.840
You're gonna need a warrant.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.360
Not a problem.
Known violent ex-con

07:57.440 --> 07:59.640
who just happens to be
the Iast person
seen with the victim.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.880
We're just waiting for
the Iab tech, so why don't you
have a seat, Counselor?

08:05.520 --> 08:08.880
Have an orange juice.
Natural sugar's
better than a candy bar.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.440
Oh, thanks.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.240
We're holding a suspect,
so if it pans out,
we'II do a Iineup.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.800
You know where to find me.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.040
You're thinking
about it right now,
just using one more time.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.440
AII day, every day.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.720
And one more time
will kill you, Phil.
You know that, right?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.880
Smoker doesn't know
which cigarette
will give him cancer.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.320
Drinker doesn't know which
cocktail will give him
cirrhosis. It's a compulsion.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.120
You gotta stop making excuses.
Take this.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.679
We get Mueller's DNA?

08:32.720 --> 08:33.880
It's on its way to the Iab.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.120
Anything on the victim
from Missing Persons?

08:36.200 --> 08:38.760
National Center for
Missing & Exploited Children
got a hit.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.000
In Cedar Creek, Arkansas,
a 17-year-old boy

08:41.080 --> 08:43.000
Wesley Jansen
went missing in 1993.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.480
STABLER: Juvenile records?
No. Part of the kids'
fingerprint program.

08:45.560 --> 08:46.640
You contacted his parents?

08:46.720 --> 08:47.760
They're flying in.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.160
What's the connection between
the runaway and the ex-con?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.840
Well, Mueller played dumb
on the envelope, but he's been
in the drug trade,

08:52.920 --> 08:56.040
so it's a dope payoff
or money to make a buy.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.760
If he's making bank selling
drugs, then why's he doing
Ray Borland's Iaundry?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.000
I checked with Narcotics.
Borland's a player.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.400
Got caught holding on a couple
of big-time possession beefs.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.640
Bought his way out from under.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.160
He was connected. The real
Iaundry is cleaning money.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.400
So, Mueller fronts as
Borland's man on the street.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.120
Wesley Jansen, a.k.a.
Peter Ivanhoe,
is either a dealer...

09:14.200 --> 09:16.560
Thanks.
...mule or a client.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.720
Hospital just called.
Our victim is awake,
so go ask him nicely.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.600
STABLER: Who's Wesley Jansen?

09:26.640 --> 09:29.040
If that's the name
of my roomie, he's gone.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.000
Do you know where he went?
He didn't talk to me.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.280
Well, what time did he skip?

09:32.360 --> 09:33.560
About 30 minutes ago.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.440
He Iost it
when the nurse told him
the cops were on the way.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.920
You Iet John Doe just walk
out of here with a gut wound?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.680
He's ambulatory,
but just barely.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.880
The dressing
has to be changed. He needs
round-the-clock antibiotics.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.400
This guy will be back
with a staph infection.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.520
Did he have any visitors
coming in or out of here?

09:48.560 --> 09:51.240
Not a soul. AII he did
was yak on the phone.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.000
"I Iove you. Don't worry.
See you soon."

09:55.280 --> 09:58.120
Well, the idea
of talking to the cops
spooked him so much

09:58.160 --> 09:59.520
that he runs with
a bullet wound in his gut.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.760
Someone had to pick him up.
We'II dump his phones
and find out who.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.640
Open up. Police.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.080
TV's on. It's a good sign.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.680
Oh, God. What?

10:14.760 --> 10:16.040
Wesley Jansen?
Yeah.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.600
Can we come in?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.520
Nice place.
Sure beats a hospital room.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.320
Yeah. I'm gonna pay
for that bill, I swear.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.560
This isn't about the bill.
It's about your assault.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.280
Yeah. Okay.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.720
We'd Iike you to come down
to the station

10:30.800 --> 10:34.560
so we can take your statement,
or we can take you back
to the hospital.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.720
Look, I don't have
any insurance, and I didn't
see the guy who attacked me.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.280
So, I was mugged.
It happens all the time,
right?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.800
So, why are you packing?

10:42.880 --> 10:46.240
I just thought I'd take
a break from the city.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.680
You seem a Iittle jumpy,
a Iittle nervous. Even scared.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.600
I was attacked.
How should I act?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.800
Is someone after you?
No.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.160
You being threatened?
No.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.960
BENSON: Wesley,
we know about the rape.
That's crazy.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.120
Well, we've got semen
from the three different men

11:06.160 --> 11:08.360
and a gun shot wound here.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.720
What are you doing out of bed?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.120
You're gonna kill yourself.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.200
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, baby.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.560
JAINA: Are you the police?

11:19.640 --> 11:22.040
Yeah. We're here about
Wesley's assault.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.480
I'm Jaina, Wesley's wife.
This is our Mara.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.400
Here's your pills.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.480
Thanks.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.640
JAINA: So, did you
catch that mugger?

11:33.680 --> 11:36.080
No, sweetheart,
I told them that I'd be okay.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.160
We're still gonna want Wesley
to come down to the station

11:38.240 --> 11:40.160
to answer a few questions.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.960
Maybe when
he's feeling better.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.760
Precinct or hospital,
your choice,
but we need a statement now.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.920
Like I said,
the whole thing is a blank.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.280
We appreciate your time,
anyway.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.640
I'II show these people
to the interview room.
This way.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.520
What's going on?
Captain wants to see you.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.920
About what?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.360
Parents are here.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.720
Wesley.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.640
Mom, Dad.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.720
(CRYING)

12:07.800 --> 12:09.800
No. Take it easy.
What happened, son?

12:09.880 --> 12:11.200
Nothing. I'm okay.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.000
It's been eight years.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.560
I'm just so happy
to see you're alive.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.640
STABLER: Are you ready
to talk, Wesley?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.520
Why'd you call my parents?
I don't want them here.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.120
Why'd you run away?
They do something to you?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.080
I don't want to talk about it.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.280
Fine. We're only interested
in your assault and the rape.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.360
No one raped me.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.840
Then how do you explain
the semen inside of you?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.280
Was it consensual?

12:35.320 --> 12:36.640
I'm married. I've got a kid.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.600
Look, Iots of people hit for
both teams. Now, either you
were forced or you weren't.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.440
Okay, I'm bisexual.
Are we done?

12:42.480 --> 12:43.880
No, who shot you?

12:46.240 --> 12:48.400
You're hiding something,
and we're trying to help you.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.520
No. You can't.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.040
We take rape
and assault very seriously.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.480
We keep investigating
with or without help.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.440
AII right. I was hit
outside the bar, all right?

12:58.520 --> 13:00.720
I was knocked on the head,
and the rest is a blur.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
What do you want from me?

13:01.840 --> 13:04.040
Why don't we start
with the truth?

13:04.120 --> 13:05.720
There's no evidence
that you were knocked out.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.560
There's no contusions
to the back of your head.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.880
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.760
Any aliases?
No.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.760
Your husband's got two names.
You sure you don't
want to amend that?

13:14.840 --> 13:18.920
My name is Jaina Jansen,
formerly Jaina Tobias
of Cedar Creek, Arkansas.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.040
Just ask my mother-in-Iaw.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.840
When did you Iast see your
husband before his attack?

13:24.920 --> 13:26.920
That afternoon. He'd gone out
to run some errands,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.760
and when he didn't come back,
I called the police.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.400
They said
I had to wait 48 hours.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.000
Which precinct?

13:32.400 --> 13:33.800
You don't believe me?

13:33.840 --> 13:37.520
BENSON:
Wesley, it's really hard
admitting that you were raped.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.000
You feel guilt.
You feel shame.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.200
But you've gotta deal with it,
for yourself
and for your family.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.880
Okay, I will.
Is the Iecture over?

13:48.920 --> 13:53.200
No. What was in the envelope
Willem Mueller
passed you in the bar?

13:53.240 --> 13:55.240
Payments for working
on Ray Borland's house.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.880
AII of it in cash?
Yeah.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.480
How much?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.880
$4,500, which was stolen
when I got mugged.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.200
That's an awful Iot of cash.
Must've been a big job.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.880
Do a Iot of construction
with that bum
right hand of yours?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.200
My other one works just fine.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.760
Then, why use an alias,
Peter Ivanhoe?

14:11.240 --> 14:13.160
I don't know. I made it up
when Jaina and I ran away.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.760
I thought my parents would be
Iooking. I just got
in the habit of using it.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.080
Well, what about
Jaina's parents?

14:18.160 --> 14:22.080
They're dead. Her father
killed her mother in front
of her and then offed himself.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.600
Nobody Iooked out
for her except for me.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.360
Maybe you knew your hubby
was making a drug deal

14:27.440 --> 14:29.400
and you don't call that
into the police.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.840
Oh, my God.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.080
You've got Wesley involved
with drugs?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.760
No, I don't,

14:34.800 --> 14:36.760
but it's just Iike you
to blame me for this.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.640
He never gave us any trouble
until he met you.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.200
Yeah, I suppose I seduced him,
too. Got pregnant on purpose
so he'd marry me.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.320
I wouldn't put it
past a slut Iike you.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.600
MUNCH: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now cut it out, you two.
Wesley Ioves me!

14:46.640 --> 14:49.480
Ms. Jansen, wait in
the Captain's office or Ieave.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.480
You park it and chill out.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.760
What the hell is going on?

14:54.840 --> 14:58.440
That Iady called Mommy a slut.
What does that mean?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.240
Wesley.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.120
CHESTER: Son, wait.
Let's go.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.200
What...
Wesley.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.040
Well, that was a hell
of a family reunion.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.960
I had a mother-in-Iaw
Iike that, I just might take
a swing at her myself.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.480
We checked with Cedar Creek PD
about the murder-suicide.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.080
Jaina was 10
when it went down.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.200
She moved in with an aunt
whose boyfriend
sexually assaulted her.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.080
The parents said
that Wesley's always had
a soft spot for Jaina.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.840
He even tried to get
his parents to take her in.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.440
Let me guess, they passed.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.520
After that, he went from
college-bound to truant.
It became all about Jaina.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.280
Mara's seven years old,
so Jaina ran
when she was pregnant.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.040
To a city where the predators
know a victim
when they see one.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.800
But where are we on the rape?

15:48.880 --> 15:51.760
Without a complaining witness,
it doesn't exist.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.680
I don't know why
this guy is holding back.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.280
But being this scared,
he knows his attackers.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.880
Still got attempted murder,
unless you want to
hand it off.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.560
Have I ever?

16:02.440 --> 16:04.200
AII right, here's what we got.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.040
Borland claimed that
he didn't know Wesley
when we showed him his photo,

16:07.120 --> 16:10.160
but Wesley was paid by Mueller
for Borland's
alleged home repairs.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.560
It's got to be
a drug connection.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.960
Well, Iean on Borland.
We'II get an explanation.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.200
Lab report says
Mueller's DNA is a match.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.280
Any takers on Borland
matching, too?

16:18.360 --> 16:21.800
We can't get a warrant
for his DNA
unless Mueller gives him up.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.840
STABLER:
Let's bring them both in.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.200
My client is willing to
cooperate fully.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.880
But if the questions
go outside the scope,
I'II bury you in paper.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.720
Well, we dream in triplicate,
so Iet's cut
the chest-thumping.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.680
Wesley Jansen says
that he works for you.
We're acquaintances.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.840
Then why'd you Iie to us
when you said
you didn't know him?

16:38.920 --> 16:41.840
Most people don't want
to get involved.
I'm no different.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.640
Sodomy in the First, along
with his convict history.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.280
What do you think, Munch,
18 to 25?

16:47.360 --> 16:49.720
Minimum.
I didn't rape anyone.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.120
We're not allowed
to talk to you.
You asked for a Iawyer.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.640
This is a no-brainer
with the DNA match
in Wesley Jansen.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.320
Damn, I hope the perp
can do this kind of time.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.240
He wouldn't have to
if he cooperated.
The D.A. Iikes to make deals.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.960
What kind of work
did Wesley Jansen do for you?

17:04.040 --> 17:05.640
Odd jobs,

17:05.680 --> 17:09.319
You lied to us
about knowing him,
and you're lying right now,

17:09.359 --> 17:12.119
He was gang-raped
by three men,

17:12.200 --> 17:15.079
and we've ID'd one of his
attackers as your Iive-in,
Willem Mueller.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.560
That's it. Interview's over.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.160
What are the odds
the DNA sample from you
will match the evidence?

17:19.240 --> 17:21.160
Get a court order,
otherwise hold your breath.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.200
Mueller's facing
some pretty serious time,

17:23.280 --> 17:26.760
so he's across the hall,
probably giving you up
right now.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.360
There's nothing he can say
to incriminate me.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.320
So, where you think
he'll do his time,
Dannemora or Sing Sing?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.280
$100 on the big house
in Ossining,
He's got old friends up there,

17:36.360 --> 17:37.840
You got to show me
the cash first,

17:37.920 --> 17:41.280
We were making a movie.
Nobody got raped.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.400
You can't talk to us
without your Iawyer.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.400
I'II sign a release
if it'II get me out of here.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.200
Hancock the bottom.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.480
What kind of movie?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.600
Gay porn.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.000
I produce films.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.080
I sent Willem Mueller
to pay Wesley
for his services.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.120
One of the best group scenes
we've ever shot.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.360
And why should
we believe that?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.320
Well, I could screen
the film for you,
if you'd Iike.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.080
So, Wesley's one of your
gay porn stars?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.480
Don't be ridiculous.
He's not gay.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.920
Gay-on-straight
sells a Iot of videos,
especially if it's bareback.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.680
Wesley's strictly gay-for-pay
at 1,500 bucks a bang.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.040
Well, now we know
why Wesley wasn't cooperating.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.680
He didn't want us
digging into his background.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.600
He's either ashamed
or he's afraid of somebody.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.560
A straight guy wouldn't
want the world to know
he's doing gay porn.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.080
Maybe he's in trouble
with the mob.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.000
Porn is a multi-billion dollar
mom-and-pop industry now.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.720
The mob got out of it
a Iong time ago.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.280
And wise guys never walk away
from that much cheddar.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.040
Your victim was shot
in the gut,
not in the heart or the head.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.920
That is a slow, painful
way to die. The motive's
got to be personal.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.720
You think it's a jealous
gay costar who bought
into the make-believe?

18:43.760 --> 18:46.360
If it is a criminal element,
we can offer
Wesley protection.

18:46.440 --> 18:50.400
Just remind him, whoever
shot him could come back
for another try.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.840
Excuse me,
we're Iooking for the Jansens.
No one's answering their door.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.360
Is he dead? I called
the ambulance. They got here
pretty quick, considering.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.800
What happened?
I didn't mind
Iooking in on Wesley,

19:02.840 --> 19:05.800
but the second time I went up,
he was out cold,
so I called 911.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.880
Do you know which hospital?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.400
Probably St. Martin's.
You know, no insurance.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.400
Where's Jaina?

19:11.480 --> 19:12.520
Well, she had to work.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.000
She Ieft me this number.
I called her.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.400
It was some management
company, and they said
they'd give her the message.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.240
STABLER:
Pornography isn't illegal.
Making it isn't illegal.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.280
Now is there some reason
you neglected to tell us?

19:25.360 --> 19:26.360
It's none of your business.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.600
Who shot you, Wesley?

19:28.720 --> 19:31.040
I told you I wasn't raped.
I told you I wasn't gay.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.200
So, why won't you believe me
when I say I don't know?

19:33.280 --> 19:36.960
Because our experience
has been someone Iies once,
they make it a bad habit.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.560
I didn't Iie.
Okay, omitting the truth
is the same thing.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.320
I see the way you're
Iooking at me.

19:43.400 --> 19:47.640
I'm scum because I make money
having sex. So, why do you
care who shot me?

19:48.400 --> 19:50.120
Because it's our job.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.160
I got nothing else to say.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.160
Look, if somebody's after you,
then no one in your family
is safe.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.280
Where's your wife?
You Ieave her out of this.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.400
BENSON: Either you tell us
where she is,

20:01.480 --> 20:03.480
or we will find your wife
and find out
how much she knows.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.120
PIease don't involve Jaina.
You don't understand
what you're doing.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.520
Then you start explaining
to us, because we're
running out of options here.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.720
May I help you?

20:28.680 --> 20:29.960
Jaina Jansen.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.480
She in some kind of trouble?

20:32.680 --> 20:35.720
If you could just wait,
I'II Iet them know
back there...

20:35.760 --> 20:38.600
OMAN: Come on, Jaina. That's
it, honey. That's it, good.
Pick up the pace a Iittle.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.240
Joey, just kneel down behind
her. AII right. A Iittle more
to the Ieft. Good. Good.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.560
(STABLER WHISTLES)

20:43.640 --> 20:45.240
What are you doing here?

20:45.320 --> 20:47.240
You ruined my shot.
Who are you?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.720
Police.
We need to talk to Jaina.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.160
AII right, no, no, no,
everybody just relax.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.000
We're not doing anything
illegal here, okay.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.480
I'm Cal Oman,
the director of this film,

20:53.560 --> 20:54.880
and I assure you
everything's in order.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.120
Look, this isn't about you.
Can we do this Iater, please?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.400
No, Jaina, you need to
get dressed,
because we need to talk.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.120
Well, actually, she doesn't
have to, because
she's not under arrest.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.480
We're making a movie here.
Time is money.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.320
AII right,
stand over there, please.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.920
Now, you know that Wesley's
back in the hospital?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, he called.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.360
I was going to call him
back on my break. Is he okay?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.000
He's fine.

21:15.280 --> 21:19.440
Look, if I don't work,
I don't get paid,
and we need this money.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.600
Look, am I gonna
have to call a Iawyer?
Give me the phone.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.000
Why don't you call two?
They'II both tell you
to stay out of it.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.440
Look, get a warrant
or get Iost. AII right?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.280
This is my building,
and I don't want you here.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.560
Mommy, can I have quarters
for the soda machine?

21:30.640 --> 21:33.560
Jaina, I'm sorry.
I tried to get her,
but I couldn't stop her.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.920
What in the hell
is your daughter
doing on a porn set?

21:42.120 --> 21:44.360
Can I see my daughter, please?
She needs me.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.240
You couldn't find
a baby-sitter?

21:46.320 --> 21:47.440
No.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.480
Wesley's sick.
I had to take her with me.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.160
What about your in-Iaws?
Why not ask them?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.520
So they can teach her
to hate me?

21:55.400 --> 21:59.040
Besides, nobody
can take care of Mara
except me and Wes.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.680
Yeah? Why's that?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.160
I need to get her home.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.400
You're not going anywhere,
and neither is Mara.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.360
I didn't do anything wrong.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.840
We're charging you
with child endangerment.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.320
You took your daughter
to a porn set.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.120
It's not exactly a healthy
and safe environment for kids.

22:14.160 --> 22:18.560
PIease, don't do this.
If I go to jail,
who takes care of Mara?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.760
Either Children's Services
or your in-Iaws.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.920
She has cystic fibrosis.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.680
She needs constant care.
I'm doing the best that I can.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.920
There's doctor visits
and shots, pills.

22:34.960 --> 22:38.640
Wesley's the only one
that knows how
to do her chest therapy,

22:38.720 --> 22:41.520
and somebody has to
bring in a paycheck.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.360
Okay, we'II consider
putting you on notice.

22:43.440 --> 22:47.560
That means Children's Services
will check in on you
from time to time.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.040
What's the catch?

22:50.120 --> 22:54.800
Well, it's pretty obvious that
Wesley doesn't care about
his own well-being. Do you?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.520
I can't help you.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.360
Jaina, somebody tried
to kill your husband.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.320
You cooperate with us,
and you can walk
out that door.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.880
You're gonna have to
arrest me.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.160
We threaten to take her kid,
and she still won't talk.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.160
It's not a threat.
She endangered a child.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.920
That's enough to remove
a minor from her care.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.640
Jaina is obviously terrified.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.720
If the mob is connected,
we're just adding
more pressure.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.120
And the daughter's terminal.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.400
I don't want to put
a sick child
with Children's Services.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.960
Can't the grandparents
take custody?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.760
Well, that's not gonna help
Wesley and Jaina.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.680
Somebody's squeezing them
to keep quiet, but aren't we
just doing the same thing?

23:41.720 --> 23:42.680
They're jerking us around.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.960
If we have to force them
to cooperate,
I'm fine with that.

23:45.040 --> 23:49.040
Yeah, Wesley got very agitated
when we told him
we were going to Jaina.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.640
Maybe she's been
the target all along,
and he just got in the middle.

23:52.720 --> 23:56.200
If we're thinking mob,
check into this pornographer,
Cal Oman,

23:56.280 --> 23:58.320
see if he's a connected guy.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.360
Ten minutes, then I gotta
block the next shot.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.720
Vice gave us an earful about
you. Lots of charges
from extortion to blackmail.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.880
Lots of trumped-up charges,
but no convictions.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.040
Yet.
You ever thought about
doing a movie?

24:09.120 --> 24:11.560
You Iook Iike
you'd be a real natural.
You still work for
the Santuccis?

24:11.640 --> 24:14.120
Having friends
from the old neighborhood
is not a criminal offense.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.400
I am a filmmaker, not a hood.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.080
Who finances those movies?

24:17.160 --> 24:19.480
Look, why don't you just quit
fishing and get to the point?

24:19.560 --> 24:22.600
Okay, you're pretty small
potatoes in the porn industry.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.800
Jaina Jansen's
your only big star.
Yeah.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.000
STABLER: For such a big draw,
she doesn't work that much.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.640
Her husband get in the way?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.440
The Iess she works,
the more the public wants her.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.560
Wesley moonlighting, I mean,
that must've pissed you off.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.240
Why? I don't use him
that much,

24:36.320 --> 24:38.760
and now with
the bareback-riding thing,
I won't use him at all.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.600
Yeah, but married couples
don't use condoms,

24:40.680 --> 24:42.360
so he's putting your star
at risk.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.080
You know, if Jaina wants
to play Russian roulette,
that's her business.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.080
I made her a star. I can make
another one just Iike her.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.160
Yeah,
but wouldn't it be easier
just to get rid of Wesley?

24:49.240 --> 24:51.160
Look, I hate to disappoint
you, but I didn't shoot
the bastard.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.520
Okay, so, where were you
that night?
Right here. Prepping a movie.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.960
Who were you with?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.880
I was rehearsing one of
the new girls, Delia Sarton.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.440
Just Iike I used to with Jaina
in the old days.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.800
You and Jaina were involved?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.240
Long time ago,
but I've moved on.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.440
Jaina's got mileage.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.360
Who wants to be with a chick
that's been with
a hundred guys?

25:06.440 --> 25:08.720
So, where can we find
Delia Sarton?

25:08.800 --> 25:12.840
She's getting a body wax.
My receptionist
will tell you where she is.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.680
Hi.
Hi, Delia Sarton?

25:18.200 --> 25:21.000
Yeah, that's me.
Cal said you wanted
to ask me questions.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.920
Yeah. Did he mention why?

25:22.960 --> 25:26.120
No, he didn't tell me
what to say,
if that's what you mean.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.400
Where were you two nights ago?

25:28.480 --> 25:31.120
From 8:30 to 1:00,
I was with Cal on set.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.520
Do you always rehearse
that Iate?

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
AII the time.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.200
How'd you get home?
I took a cab.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.960
What cab company?

25:38.040 --> 25:39.200
It was yellow.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.600
What'd you do
before you went to rehearsal?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.720
Who were you with?
Where'd you go?

25:45.800 --> 25:46.800
I don't remember.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.240
Did you know that
you can be charged
with obstruction of justice,

25:49.320 --> 25:53.360
giving a false statement to
a police officer and perjury,
if this goes to trial?

25:53.440 --> 25:56.600
Sixteen months to three years
in Bedford Hills prison.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.440
Delia, do you want
to change your statement?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.320
I didn't mean...

26:04.240 --> 26:08.040
I just want to be a star
Iike Jaina. Cal gives her
all the best parts.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.280
Is that what he promised you
if you vouched for him?

26:12.880 --> 26:17.600
He set up a gang-bang
for Jaina in Vegas.
300 guys in 10 hours.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.960
She's gonna be
on Howard Stern.
Cal's crazy about her.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.680
What do you mean, crazy?

26:22.760 --> 26:24.560
He says she belongs to him.

26:25.520 --> 26:29.120
PIease don't tell on me.
If Cal finds out...
Don't worry.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.200
"File no 745243.
People v, Jaina Jansen,

26:39.280 --> 26:40.680
"One count,
child endangerment.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.680
"One count, unlawful dealing
with a child."

26:42.760 --> 26:47.320
Objection. Unlawful dealing
covers minors in bars,
obscenities and prostitution.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.720
That isn't the case here.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.880
Pornography is a form
of Iegal prostitution.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.000
The minor's physical,
mental and emotional welfare
was corrupted.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.200
I agree. How do you plead,
Mr. Schoenfeld?

26:56.280 --> 26:58.560
Not guilty and request ROR.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.080
The defendant
is a porn actress.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.200
She took her daughter to work,
exposing her to an environment
of wanton sexual activity.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.840
The minor child was confined
to an area where all members
of the cast are clothed.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.720
My client did everything
to shield her daughter.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.080
CABOT: Except to
get a baby-sitter.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.400
The defendant's in-Iaws were
in town and were never called.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.600
SCHOENFELD: The Iittle girl
suffers from cystic fibrosis.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.760
She can't be Ieft
in the care of just anyone.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.320
Then your client
should have thought of that

27:19.400 --> 27:22.320
before she took an
innocent child to a porn set.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.600
Your client has endangered
the welfare of a minor.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.240
For the privilege
of her freedom,
I want $5,000, cash or bond.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.720
Next case.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.160
CLERK:
"Docket number 28763..."

27:36.400 --> 27:39.320
We know Cal's connected
and we know he's got
a thing for your wife.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.600
He tried to kill you.
Next time you're not
gonna be so Iucky.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.800
Next time it might be
your daughter.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.360
But maybe that's
what you want, huh?

27:45.440 --> 27:48.840
I mean, you must be awful
tired of being saddled
with a sick kid.

27:48.920 --> 27:52.000
You just calm down. Calm down.
AII right.

27:52.080 --> 27:56.160
Now, you've just assaulted
a police officer
and I'm gonna frisk you,

27:57.360 --> 28:00.000
just in case any of Cal's
friends are hanging around.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.400
And then I'm gonna arrest you
unless you start
talking to us.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.720
If I say anything,
Mara gets hurt
and I can't risk it.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.240
Then give us your statement
so we can put Cal Oman away.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.440
We can protect you.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.720
No, you can't.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.040
Jaina already tried to Ieave.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.280
He said that he made her
and that she wasn't
going anywhere.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.760
So he shot you
to prove it to her?

28:16.840 --> 28:18.880
We never thought
he'd go that far.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.160
He would've killed me
if that homeless guy
hadn't shown up.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.400
So, stand up and say that.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.080
My daughter is dying.
We do porn to pay
for her bills.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.120
Do you understand that?
There is nothing
that I wouldn't do for her.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.960
I'm going to bail my wife out.

28:34.040 --> 28:37.680
If you keep coming after us,
you're just gonna
make it worse.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.680
He's boxed in pretty tight.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.440
Since Cal Oman
Iied about his alibi,

28:53.520 --> 28:55.480
maybe we should bring him in
and do a Iittle two-on-one.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.920
Well, it sounds Iike fun,
but that'II give him
a heads-up

28:58.000 --> 29:01.640
and too much time to be
working out another
explanation with his friends.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.320
Okay, so we pull our witness
in and do a Iineup.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.040
He IDs Oman, we Iock him down,
with no way out.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.640
That's if Munch
and Fin can still Iocate Phil.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.880
What a surprise,
Phil's back in rehab.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.160
His ID won't be any good.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.400
That's for Cabot to decide.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.000
It's a waste of time. What?

29:20.080 --> 29:22.280
Don't you think you're taking
Phil's relapse too personally?

29:22.360 --> 29:24.440
He's jeopardizing the case
and making my job harder.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.920
I always take that personally.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.440
Early on,
I had a partner Iike you
used to get worked up.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.720
What happened?
He ate his gun.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.680
I need you to focus, Phil.
I've got some pictures
you need to see.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.760
Okay. I'm hurting bad.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.760
We need you to identify
the guy you saw
do the shooting.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.440
What shooting?

29:42.480 --> 29:43.920
That's it.
I think we're done here.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.920
Where's the fire, AIex?
We need this.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.280
Is it against the rules
to remind him of the incident?

29:50.880 --> 29:54.440
Jog his memory about what he
went through and nothing else.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.520
How'd you get that scratch
on your face, Phil?

30:01.960 --> 30:03.360
It hurts.

30:03.440 --> 30:07.080
Phil, you wanna be a stupid
dick and kill yourself,
you go right ahead.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.840
I need you to Iook
at these damn pictures.

30:11.760 --> 30:15.360
You gave me orange juice.
You're a nice guy.

30:15.440 --> 30:20.080
Yeah, I'm a nice guy.
Look at the pictures.
You see anybody?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.480
Brunette. Snub-nose revolver.

30:32.560 --> 30:35.560
I can't take these to a judge.
Your witness
is coming off of heroin.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.960
He was clean
during his statement.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.920
We got a tox screen,
thanks to my partner,
so we're covered.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.400
Can't you call in a favor?

30:41.480 --> 30:44.960
After working with this unit
I don't have that many Ieft.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.640
Move! Move!

30:51.560 --> 30:52.680
COP 1: CIear.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.200
COP 2: CIear.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.400
It's Cal Oman.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.040
Okay. Get me an evidence bag.
I want Prints and Ballistics
on this.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.200
Tell the Iab. Make it a rush.

31:10.520 --> 31:14.200
Entry wound's through
the back. He was running away.

31:14.280 --> 31:18.160
Well, that tends to happen
when you're facing
the barrel of a gun.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.800
AII right, take it easy.
We got a sick child in there.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.600
COP 1: CIear.
CIear.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.800
COP 2: CIear.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.880
They're running.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.680
With Wesley's prints
all over the murder weapon,

31:36.760 --> 31:38.680
this goes out citywide,
he becomes a mark.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.200
Well, they're broke,
so they can't get that far.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.680
We know where his parents
are staying. Let's go alone.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.240
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

31:53.200 --> 31:54.200
My son didn't do this.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.840
WESLEY: Mom, you have to do
this three times a day, okay?

31:55.920 --> 31:58.120
She will whine.
She'II say it hurts.
You can't Iet that stop you.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.160
She will die if you don't.
Say you understand.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.800
I understand.
On your feet, Wesley.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.360
PIease. Just give me a second,
please?

32:04.600 --> 32:07.080
There's six positions.
Chest, back,
both sides, all right?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.360
Five minutes each.
Try to make her cough after.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.240
If she gets a fever,
call her doctor,
Dr. Lawrence Baylord.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.600
That's her pulmonologist.
See she takes pancreatic
enzymes also.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.360
Don't worry.
I'II take good care of her.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.400
(CRYING) Don't go.
Sweetie, sweetie.
AII right, Iisten.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.880
Grandma's going to finish,
because I have to go
with the police.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.600
Daddy, please!
Okay, we're not gonna cuff you

32:23.680 --> 32:26.120
in front of her, but you
have to come with us now.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.600
I Iove you, honey.
Wesley.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.880
It'II be okay.
PIease don't go.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.400
(MARA CRYING)

32:32.480 --> 32:35.520
Come on, Mara, be a good girl.
PIease, Daddy, don't go!

32:36.400 --> 32:37.680
PIease.
Daddy, I'm gonna miss you.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.400
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.520
You have the right...
Daddy, please!

32:41.600 --> 32:42.720
Daddy!

32:43.600 --> 32:44.880
(COUGHING)

32:45.840 --> 32:46.960
Daddy!

32:50.400 --> 32:53.720
My parents took out a second
mortgage on their house
for Mara.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.640
She's on the transplant Iist.
She's gonna be
in the hospital for awhile.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.240
Jaina didn't need to do
the gang-bang anymore.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.760
So, I just went over there,
and I tried to reason
with Cal.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.280
Reason with the man
who shot you?

33:04.360 --> 33:06.600
It sounds more Iike
a motive for murder to me.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.840
Well, that's not true. I mean,

33:09.320 --> 33:11.560
I'm in enough trouble
as it is,
why would I need to Iie?

33:11.600 --> 33:15.360
Because it's the difference
between parole
and a Iife sentence.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.680
I didn't mean to kill him.

33:18.760 --> 33:22.480
We fought,
and he pulled the gun,
and we struggled with it,

33:22.560 --> 33:24.200
and it went off.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.360
Are you claiming self-defense?

33:26.440 --> 33:29.040
Yeah. Well, yeah.
That's how it happened.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.440
Well, the evidence doesn't
support your story.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.680
There were no signs
of a struggle in that room.

33:34.760 --> 33:38.520
And if it went down Iike
you say, the prints on the gun
would be smudged.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.040
Where's Jaina?

33:46.120 --> 33:48.000
She's taking care
of a few things.

33:48.960 --> 33:53.040
She's moving back to Arkansas
with my parents.
She's gonna Iive there.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.400
Okay.
You need to change your story,
and you need to do it now,

33:58.480 --> 34:01.320
because once we walk out
this room, we're gonna
recommend to the prosecution

34:01.400 --> 34:03.000
that they go for the maximum.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.760
But if you tell us the truth,
we will try
to get you Ieniency.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.120
Our phone was ringing
off the hook.

34:13.639 --> 34:16.960
Guys were calling
from L.A. and Vegas.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.560
They wanted to sign her up
for bigger and better stunts.

34:20.639 --> 34:24.360
You know, just Iining up
to turn her into
a sideshow freak.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.960
So, you shot him?

34:28.080 --> 34:31.239
I just wanted her out.
I didn't mean for him to die.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.199
"File number 565429.
People v, Wesley Jansen,

34:41.280 --> 34:43.360
"Manslaughter
in the First Degree."

34:43.440 --> 34:44.520
How do you plead?

34:44.600 --> 34:45.760
I'm guilty, Your Honor.

34:45.840 --> 34:49.320
The defendant confessed to SVU
detectives and signed
his own statement.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.800
We're satisfied
with the facts.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.560
Fine. Remand until allocution.
Next case.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.360
CLERK:
"Docket number 51 28763."

35:00.840 --> 35:01.880
Take some.

35:01.960 --> 35:05.480
Detectives.
Look, is there anything
you can do for my son?

35:06.840 --> 35:09.720
Mr. Jansen, your son
has confessed to homicide.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.920
There's nothing...
It's completely
out of our hands.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.800
You know,
it's just not in him.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.920
STABLER: Well,
with all due respect, sir,

35:14.960 --> 35:17.000
you haven't seen your son
in a number of years.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.160
I know my son didn't do this.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.520
This is her fault.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.960
You keep blaming Jaina
for Wesley's bad judgment.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.640
Well, where the hell is she?
She told us she's not
going back to Arkansas.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.560
Wesley's going through hell.
She's nowhere to be found.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.080
Is Mara going with her?

35:33.160 --> 35:34.960
Mara's going to Iive with us.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.720
Well,
even if we wanted to help,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.600
the preliminary Iab report
shows your son's prints
on the murder weapon.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.520
I know people change,
but my son
didn't shoot anyone.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.640
I hunt. I have rifles.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.080
Wesley, he never touched them.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.200
Never.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.840
Did you find any other prints
besides our perp's?

36:00.920 --> 36:03.080
None. No smudges
and no partials,

36:03.120 --> 36:04.960
but I did find prints
belonging to the victim

36:05.040 --> 36:06.760
on the other rounds
inside the weapon.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.960
That doesn't make any sense
unless you wiped it clean.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.680
Can you tell us which hands
made the prints?

36:10.760 --> 36:12.040
His right.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.600
That's a tight trigger.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.200
Wesley doesn't have the
dexterity to fire that gun.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.280
So, why did he wipe it off
and put his prints
all over it?

36:20.360 --> 36:22.920
Who has he been protecting
from day one?

36:24.320 --> 36:27.480
You Ieaving?
I've got a bus to catch.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.640
You weren't in court today.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.080
I just couldn't deal with it.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.800
Your husband's going
to prison. Don't you care?

36:33.880 --> 36:35.440
Of course I care,

36:36.840 --> 36:40.160
but I have to accept it
and deal with reality.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.000
I gotta start over.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.240
They have porn in Arkansas,
or are you just giving it up?

36:46.320 --> 36:49.320
Porn isn't what you think.
A Iot of it's fake.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.880
And there's no way
I'm going back

36:50.960 --> 36:53.920
to where small town people
with small minds judge me.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.600
So, where are you headed?

36:55.680 --> 36:57.320
Vegas, then L.A.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.320
It's my Iast chance.
I really need this.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.560
If I'm not a star
before I'm 30,

37:01.640 --> 37:04.480
I can forget about
being a producer,
a director Iater on.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.480
What about your daughter?

37:07.680 --> 37:09.960
She's gonna stay
with my in-Iaws.

37:10.400 --> 37:14.160
I'II make enough money
and send it back
till I get a nice place,

37:14.240 --> 37:16.720
and I'm gonna hire
the best Iawyer for Wes.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.240
So, you get to be
the porn queen

37:18.320 --> 37:22.040
while your husband takes
the fall for a crime
he didn't commit?

37:24.520 --> 37:25.960
You think he's innocent?

37:26.040 --> 37:28.000
The evidence proves
that he is.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.440
Thank God.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.320
When's he getting out?

37:34.400 --> 37:37.000
Why don't we go inside
and talk about it?

37:37.080 --> 37:39.080
Yeah, Iet's go back inside.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.120
Have you fired a gun recently?
No.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.520
Then you'II agree
to a gun shot residue test.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.560
Why?

37:47.640 --> 37:50.200
If we find traces of gunpowder
on your skin
or on your clothes,

37:50.280 --> 37:52.040
you're gonna need to
explain that to a judge.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.960
Gunpowder doesn't wash off
right away, so if there
are traces, we can find it.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.800
We're gonna need
the clothes you were wearing
the day Cal Oman was shot.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.800
So, are they in this bag here
or on the floor?

38:01.640 --> 38:03.360
This isn't happening.

38:05.320 --> 38:08.960
The court will probably go
easy on you.
Terminally ill child.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.280
You were a minor
who was coerced
into child pornography.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.760
There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.120
We know you shot Cal Oman.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.600
We just have to get you
to the Iab,
and we can prove it.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.960
He slapped me around.
He threatened me.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.440
I had to shoot him.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.640
He was shot in the back,
Jaina, trying to escape.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.800
You didn't know him.
I had to defend myself.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.800
So, then you Iet Wesley
make the sacrifice.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.600
I was a wreck.
I told him what happened.

38:45.680 --> 38:50.280
And I didn't ask him to,
but he knows Mara needs me.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.600
But you're not going
to Arkansas to be with her.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.400
You're Ieaving your child
with her grandparents.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.360
You don't understand
what it is Iike
to be trapped with a sick kid,

39:02.440 --> 39:05.840
doing three guys at a time
to pay off my debts.

39:07.600 --> 39:12.000
I have a $50,000 contract
waiting for me in Las Vegas.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.400
And Cal would've
taken all of it.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.640
He was never gonna Iet me go.

39:19.600 --> 39:23.560
Well, neither will
Bedford Hills. At Ieast
not for 15 years minimum.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.480
What happens to Jaina now?

39:42.560 --> 39:46.040
Your wife's pled not guilty.
She's going for self-defense.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.520
What are her chances?

39:48.600 --> 39:49.680
Doesn't Iook good.
