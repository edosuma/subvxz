01:18.129 --> 01:19.243
Sit

01:26.880 --> 01:28.753
Your debriefing officer was pleased

01:28.964 --> 01:31.381
by the amount of information
you brought back.

01:31.418 --> 01:32.625
Thanks, commander.

01:33.715 --> 01:37.179
The asignementon your next
voyage is even more important.

01:37.215 --> 01:39.966
- Do you know your destination?
- Yes, the captain told us,

01:40.002 --> 01:41.625
A passenger cruise to Havana, Cuba.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.046
Did He tell you the nature of your passengers?

01:45.383 --> 01:46.213
No.

01:46.759 --> 01:47.872
They are all Jews.

01:48.217 --> 01:50.587
Some even from
concentration camps.

01:51.384 --> 01:52.664
And are they allowed to leave?

01:53.218 --> 01:55.885
It was arranged by
Dr. Goebbels himself.

01:56.510 --> 01:57.541
Jews?

02:03.220 --> 02:06.616
This humanitarian voyage
will be the perfect smoke screen.

02:06.757 --> 02:09.351
Since Many of our cells
have been discovered

02:09.387 --> 02:12.551
or significant material
has been channeled through Miami to Cuba.

02:12.846 --> 02:16.592
On your arrival there, you will go ashore mingeling with the passengers,

02:16.805 --> 02:18.686
and contact Hoffman.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.512
He is our Chief agent
in Havana.

02:20.764 --> 02:21.843
Any questions?

02:23.265 --> 02:24.592
Yes man Speak Speak.

02:25.932 --> 02:29.516
Yes, no, I mean, thats clear quite clear, but...

02:29.552 --> 02:30.511
Yes, but what?

02:30.974 --> 02:33.012
These Jews...

02:34.892 --> 02:36.892
They have been given an official permit?

02:36.928 --> 02:38.515
That is not your concern.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.101
All attention will be focused on them, not on you.

02:42.138 --> 02:44.148
But these people they are passengers.

02:44.185 --> 02:46.306
It will be offencive to you to serve them?

02:48.060 --> 02:49.684
Extremely offensive, Admiral.

02:54.228 --> 02:55.223
I see.

02:55.603 --> 02:59.206
It is... it is a violation of all Party principles.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.304
Now listen to me you fool.

03:02.229 --> 03:04.600
This is not an exercise in philosophy.

03:05.438 --> 03:08.804
You have been recruited by inteligence service and given a mission.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.387
Your only concern will be to carry that out, successfully

03:13.940 --> 03:15.184
And without questions.

03:15.565 --> 03:16.654
Forgive me, sir I only ment..

03:16.690 --> 03:19.144
What are your relations
with Captain Schroeder?

03:19.399 --> 03:20.808
I misstrust him.

03:21.607 --> 03:23.148
He refuses to join the Party.

03:23.566 --> 03:26.525
That's the very reason he was chosen to be the captain on this voyage,

03:26.561 --> 03:27.982
It is above suspicion.

03:29.692 --> 03:30.723
Yes, but...

03:31.192 --> 03:33.865
the Gestapo has ordered me to observe Him.

03:33.901 --> 03:38.061
Then Observe, but you will avoid any direct confrontation.

03:39.735 --> 03:40.532
I understand...

03:40.569 --> 03:43.484
And now, report to
Your briefing officer.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.195
Try to ignore them, Try to ignore them.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.492
Hey you! Where are you from?

06:18.095 --> 06:20.418
Please, We have a suitcase missing.

06:21.262 --> 06:23.667
It is a very important suitcase, please.

07:04.602 --> 07:05.550
Come on.

07:05.769 --> 07:08.223
Everything we own is in that suitcase.

07:36.874 --> 07:40.729
Just think,how Exciting it will be.

07:41.668 --> 07:44.585
Sailing right accross the Sea in a big ship.

07:46.253 --> 07:48.545
Listen to The band Isn't it fine?

07:54.172 --> 07:57.610
And your father... will be waiting.

08:00.736 --> 08:04.383
He has been in Havana for such
long time. Just waiting for you

08:04.384 --> 08:06.676
Why didn't you come too, mutti?

08:09.282 --> 08:11.990
I can't. Not yet.

08:14.388 --> 08:16.263
Dont You want to come?

08:16.472 --> 08:18.869
For God sakes Lady can't you ever tell them the truth?

08:22.203 --> 08:24.287
Which truth would you like me to tell them?

08:27.935 --> 08:31.998
The one about why I'm staying,
Or the one about why they must go?

08:50.544 --> 08:53.148
Please Sara. Please Do not Cry.

08:55.650 --> 09:00.234
Sara, you must be a brave girl, or will you make me cry

09:04.610 --> 09:06.277
Come along girls.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.237
Not yet, Verner, please.

09:10.655 --> 09:12.530
You said goodbye.

09:16.699 --> 09:20.137
Now I bet you can't run
to the top of the gangway on your own.

09:20.242 --> 09:21.388
Yes I can.

09:21.389 --> 09:22.744
Go!

09:28.162 --> 09:29.933
Watch Me mutti!

09:41.603 --> 09:42.645
Take care.

09:43.896 --> 09:45.459
And remember...

09:46.710 --> 09:48.689
That I love you both always.

10:03.172 --> 10:05.152
I hope you don't forget me.

10:07.966 --> 10:10.570
If it's so hard to bear you would have come with them

10:14.322 --> 10:15.989
Bastard.

10:48.703 --> 10:50.058
Come on, look up!

10:55.789 --> 10:57.039
<i>You there.</i>

10:57.561 --> 10:59.749
<i>You, Who are you?</i>

11:01.000 --> 11:03.605
I am from the Ministry of Propaganda.

11:03.606 --> 11:05.898
I have orders to
Photograph these people.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.670
<i>You have no authority here.</i>

11:07.671 --> 11:10.588
<i>You either leave, or be showing away!</i>

11:27.312 --> 11:28.307
Sir.

11:29.937 --> 11:32.271
Cabin 373, D deck.

11:32.307 --> 11:33.235
Steward.

11:33.271 --> 11:35.558
- I'll find myself.
- Thats what you want.

11:52.524 --> 11:54.017
I feel like a clown.

11:54.316 --> 11:55.726
You look wonderfull.

12:24.988 --> 12:26.813
Everything is in order, Dr. Kreisler.

12:27.697 --> 12:28.692
Professor.

12:36.198 --> 12:38.438
- Joseph!
- Aaron.

12:40.574 --> 12:41.853
I ran away and left you.

12:44.116 --> 12:45.739
I thought that they had taken you.

12:46.283 --> 12:47.610
I didn't know what to do.

12:48.617 --> 12:51.153
I came here, I stood outside the gate all night.

12:51.992 --> 12:52.905
Joseph.

12:53.993 --> 12:55.616
I thought I would never see you again.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.949
I was first in this morning.

13:01.994 --> 13:03.191
Joseph.

13:12.287 --> 13:13.484
Would you mind please?

13:41.292 --> 13:43.082
Prepare to start Engines, Mr. Kolmer.

13:49.627 --> 13:50.788
Are we leaving?

13:52.252 --> 13:53.449
Really leaving?

13:53.919 --> 13:55.957
We are leaving. And on time.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.165
Germans are always on timel.

14:20.757 --> 14:22.415
Will we ever come back?

14:22.757 --> 14:26.040
This is only temporary madness.
Of course we come back.

14:31.342 --> 14:33.214
Murderers! Butchers!

14:35.468 --> 14:36.416
Mom.

14:36.634 --> 14:37.878
Leave it, come.

15:31.143 --> 15:32.601
Only one, dear.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.457
Well.

15:46.562 --> 15:49.230
The nightmare is nearly over, dearest.

15:51.022 --> 15:54.186
The climate is a lot better for you in Havana.

15:55.897 --> 15:56.643
Do you...

15:57.939 --> 15:59.598
Do you think we...

16:00.190 --> 16:01.848
We shall like it in Havana?

16:03.607 --> 16:05.598
Yes I think so.

16:05.941 --> 16:07.019
We'll like it.

16:08.649 --> 16:09.847
You know.

16:10.733 --> 16:13.187
To go to Travel somewhere

16:14.067 --> 16:15.690
anywhere,

16:17.818 --> 16:19.192
Is sometimes enough.

16:38.488 --> 16:40.811
You haven't touched your
Caviar, Mr. Rosen.

16:41.655 --> 16:42.899
Dont you care for it?

16:45.906 --> 16:47.103
- My husband...
- My father...

16:47.572 --> 16:49.729
My husband and I are not very
Good sailors, doctor.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.274
Then you come and see me,
I will give you something to help .

17:21.703 --> 17:24.192
Excuse Me sir. To follow?

17:24.369 --> 17:26.491
You have the duck or the veal.

17:28.621 --> 17:31.323
Roasted duck, veal marengo.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.160
We not whish to make any problems.

17:38.998 --> 17:41.451
No problem, sir.
Just as you wish.

17:43.165 --> 17:44.574
Whichever is easier.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.490
I think they like the veal.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.328
Anything.

17:54.542 --> 17:56.616
Will the captain be joining us?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.831
I'm afraid you'll have to do with Me.

18:03.001 --> 18:04.992
- Care to dance Miss Rosen?
- Yes.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.502
- It's a rumba, isn't it?
- Yes.

18:07.539 --> 18:08.466
I don't know if I can do that.

18:08.502 --> 18:10.375
It's very simple, just let yourself
follow the music.

18:11.711 --> 18:13.418
Why is She dancing with one of them?

18:13.628 --> 18:15.868
She doesn't understand that, Carl, please.

18:16.087 --> 18:18.872
It is a wonderful night. Why don't you try to enjoy?

18:32.465 --> 18:34.788
Better.

18:35.965 --> 18:37.043
Very good.

19:11.096 --> 19:14.094
I don't see how it could be any better than this in First class.

19:14.555 --> 19:15.379
That's right.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.364
- You may find out.
- How do you mean?

19:19.222 --> 19:21.103
Well, the purser has asked us

19:21.139 --> 19:25.032
if we like to take care of
two little girls traveling alone

19:25.068 --> 19:28.925
but take care of... it's the same
as take care of two little girls.

19:29.141 --> 19:31.048
We said He should ask you.

19:31.391 --> 19:35.468
Ohh, I `d love to. I miss my own so much.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.014
We took them out six months ago.

19:39.017 --> 19:40.889
They are waiting for me in Havana.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.100
I be so happy to see them.

19:46.413 --> 19:49.018
Of course my husband is still in Germany.

19:49.435 --> 19:51.623
Lets hope He will be able to join you soon.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.083
Lets drink to that.

20:30.590 --> 20:33.924
Doctor. I'm sorry professor.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.311
I heard your lecture
about clinical pathology

20:37.312 --> 20:39.655
At Berlin Univertisty about two years ago.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.115
It was a privilege.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.573
Thank you.

20:43.616 --> 20:45.596
But it must have been
more then two years ago.

20:45.805 --> 20:47.993
Because later I was replaced
as the head of my clinic.

20:47.994 --> 20:49.557
And forbidden to lecture.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.475
But... how did you manage?

20:54.247 --> 20:55.497
Sorry?

20:56.123 --> 20:57.686
How do you live?

20:57.687 --> 20:59.042
To survive.

21:01.647 --> 21:03.523
You know, the... human race

21:03.524 --> 21:06.024
and mine in particular

21:07.067 --> 21:09.255
has a unique capacity to survive.

21:10.089 --> 21:12.486
I lost my clinic, but I'm still a doctor.

21:13.424 --> 21:18.425
But then you where permitted to threat your own people.

21:23.219 --> 21:24.260
Yes.

21:25.824 --> 21:30.096
But even the Aryans of the SS can
suffer from blood diseases

21:30.513 --> 21:33.118
You treated the SS?

21:34.057 --> 21:35.620
I am a doctor, not a politician.

21:35.621 --> 21:36.662
SO?

21:36.976 --> 21:38.226
But you are a lawyer.

21:38.227 --> 21:40.728
I'm sure you're familiar with
The Hippocratic Oath

21:40.729 --> 21:41.771
Yes.

21:41.772 --> 21:43.230
But there are limits.

21:44.794 --> 21:48.128
As a doctor, it is obliged
to treat anyone...

21:48.962 --> 21:51.150
Who ask me for medical help.

21:51.568 --> 21:52.922
Whoever it may be.

21:56.049 --> 22:01.571
Strange enough, my last patient was the father of an SS captain.

22:04.385 --> 22:07.410
In return, he treated us with very much kindness.

22:07.511 --> 22:09.074
You See...

22:09.075 --> 22:10.846
Life is never black and white.

22:24.495 --> 22:26.891
For some of us,
Professor, life is more simple.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.914
The people you treat,
are my husband's enemies.

22:32.624 --> 22:34.186
I enjoyed your waltz.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.688
If we can be of help...

22:37.418 --> 22:38.877
please call us.

23:00.653 --> 23:02.633
Excuse me, Mrs. Rosen.

23:02.634 --> 23:04.405
Would you like a hot drink?

23:05.760 --> 23:07.844
Karl, Karl.

23:09.095 --> 23:10.658
You like a hot drink?

23:12.013 --> 23:13.472
- Ms. Rosen?
- Yes.

23:58.476 --> 23:59.857
There is company rule that

23:59.893 --> 24:03.227
forbits nembers of the crew to use passenger areas.

24:03.263 --> 24:04.554
You're breaking them.

24:06.311 --> 24:08.483
I'm authorized by Director Holthusen to use this

24:08.519 --> 24:11.720
to use the social halls when
and if  it's reasonable.

24:12.145 --> 24:14.770
You think it's reasonable
to distroy the good will of this voyage,

24:14.807 --> 24:16.678
by causing embaressment to the passengers?

24:17.146 --> 24:19.101
Embaressment, passengers?

24:20.396 --> 24:23.644
There is no law that prohibits
to sing the party songs surely?

24:24.272 --> 24:26.429
Get out. Get out all of you!

24:27.356 --> 24:28.351
From now on,

24:29.231 --> 24:32.479
the passenger areas
are subbounced to all members of the crew,

24:32.690 --> 24:33.969
except on duty.

24:34.149 --> 24:34.958
Get Out!

24:49.943 --> 24:52.017
What excactly does "hmm" mean?

24:52.485 --> 24:53.480
What?

24:54.277 --> 24:55.687
Does it register?

24:56.319 --> 24:58.808
Yes, it registers.

25:03.153 --> 25:06.401
- Give Him one of those every four hours.
- Just one, thank you Doctor.

25:06.737 --> 25:09.273
At least your condition remains stable, professor.

25:10.863 --> 25:13.648
It's nice to know that I'm
Dying in stable condition.

25:14.197 --> 25:16.899
-Mugs, don't say that.
- You're not dying.

25:17.572 --> 25:19.398
You have been under a great deal of stress.

25:22.073 --> 25:23.815
Oh, I saw my books burned.

25:24.157 --> 25:25.863
My Home defiled.

25:26.866 --> 25:29.781
We had to hide from
People we thought were our friends.

25:30.324 --> 25:32.280
I guess you could call that stress.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.490
You don't have to hide any longer.

25:38.117 --> 25:39.279
Thank you Doctor.

25:41.243 --> 25:44.194
We don't have to hide any longer.

26:13.332 --> 26:16.116
It has taken me an hour
for my mom to go to sleep.

26:16.624 --> 26:20.488
It's so long since they allowed us to go to the cinemas I feel quite excited.

27:26.927 --> 27:29.011
Excuse me sir, dont you think you ought to eat something,

27:29.047 --> 27:30.587
You hadn't anything all day.

27:32.053 --> 27:34.506
No, thanks, Gunter, I'm alright.

27:35.012 --> 27:36.006
More, sir?

27:42.763 --> 27:44.386
I'm Dr. Egon Kreisler.

27:44.930 --> 27:47.051
I come to launch an
officially protest.

27:48.097 --> 27:50.846
This quaters are private,
Doctor, didn't you see the sign?

27:51.514 --> 27:53.055
If you a complaint make it to the purser.

27:53.306 --> 27:55.463
I already did He denies responsibility

27:57.265 --> 27:58.271
I just assume

27:58.307 --> 28:00.813
that you are not in control of your ships activities,

28:00.849 --> 28:03.883
or worse, you have been part of the mockery of your passengers.

28:07.850 --> 28:08.929
Leave us.

28:17.518 --> 28:19.011
Will you sit down, doctor?

28:19.644 --> 28:21.516
It won't distract with a ceremony.

28:22.228 --> 28:23.223
As you please.

28:25.937 --> 28:29.552
I come here to demand a
personal explanation

28:29.770 --> 28:32.804
You have me at a disadvantage,
Doctor, I have no idea...

28:33.063 --> 28:36.559
We went to see a film,
A romantic comedy.

28:37.980 --> 28:41.429
Instead, We where treated to the
Newsletters of Mr. Adolf Hitler.

28:42.147 --> 28:43.345
Did you approve of this?

28:44.231 --> 28:46.187
I neither approved nor new of it.

28:46.482 --> 28:48.515
And I assure it shall not happen again.

28:51.566 --> 28:54.576
I frankly admit that there appears to be the lacks of good taste.

28:57.942 --> 29:00.016
Thank you Captain. Goodnight.

29:01.026 --> 29:02.021
Goodnight.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.158
Come on, it's time to sleep.

29:15.195 --> 29:17.214
What do you know about this man, Gunter?

29:20.154 --> 29:21.232
Kreisler

29:21.612 --> 29:23.650
I hear Sir he is an eminent doctor.

29:24.071 --> 29:25.813
I used to be at the University of Berlin.

29:26.988 --> 29:29.394
Egon Kreisler Yes, Professor.

29:31.614 --> 29:32.609
Interesting.

29:35.239 --> 29:37.775
Of all the passengers He is the
Only one who came to see me.

29:39.782 --> 29:40.777
Perhaps, sir...

29:41.240 --> 29:42.065
Yes?

29:43.533 --> 29:45.856
Perhaps if the passengers
got to know You, sir...

29:46.200 --> 29:47.776
No no no no.

29:48.033 --> 29:49.330
I have to stand appart

29:49.367 --> 29:52.034
It's the only way to see trouble before it begins.

29:54.243 --> 29:55.901
- Goodnight Mr.
- Goodnight.

29:57.660 --> 29:58.655
Gunter

29:59.285 --> 30:01.619
Tell Mr. Mueller that recration hall has to be converted

30:01.655 --> 30:03.953
Friday evening
and saturday morning

30:03.989 --> 30:05.208
For religious services.

30:05.244 --> 30:07.449
There is a rabbi on board,
notify him, will you?

30:07.703 --> 30:09.244
Yes sir. Goodnight Mr.

30:23.310 --> 30:24.977
From the Director General, sir.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.208
Imperative you make full speed.

30:28.521 --> 30:31.234
Two other refugees ships sailing for Havana.

30:31.335 --> 30:35.294
No cause for alarm, but the
Situation in Havana is fluid.

30:36.337 --> 30:38.942
If there is no cause for alarm,
Why make more speed?

30:39.568 --> 30:42.797
Any increase in speed, sir,
there won't be a  passenger in the dining room.

30:49.049 --> 30:50.508
- Heinrich.
- Yes sir.

30:51.759 --> 30:55.927
If we change course heading north of the Azores instead of this loop to the south...?

30:56.657 --> 30:58.532
How much time would we save?

30:58.637 --> 31:00.513
At our present speed, sir...

31:04.264 --> 31:07.182
About half a day but
The seas will be much rougher.

31:12.809 --> 31:14.892
Going to change course.

31:15.414 --> 31:16.976
Hold present speed.

31:18.436 --> 31:19.686
Mr. Steiman.

31:23.021 --> 31:24.792
To Director General Holthusen in Hamburg:

31:25.835 --> 31:29.273
Can improve arrival time by 12 hours.

31:30.316 --> 31:31.983
If more required...

31:32.088 --> 31:35.630
Request immediate explanation situation Havana.

31:36.673 --> 31:37.819
Did you get  that?

31:37.820 --> 31:39.174
Yes sir.

31:56.574 --> 31:58.658
We are beeing used, Ostermaier.

31:59.388 --> 32:00.951
For what, sir?

32:00.952 --> 32:02.515
I don't know.

32:03.662 --> 32:06.996
Dear,should I get Dr. Glauner again?

32:06.997 --> 32:10.226
No. No, what for? Who needs Him?

32:10.748 --> 32:12.311
I'm allright.

32:12.625 --> 32:15.438
The sea air will do you good, he said.

32:16.272 --> 32:18.772
When you get better
We will go up for walks.

32:18.773 --> 32:22.628
Yes, you will, you'll have me singing and dancing and swimming next.

32:22.629 --> 32:24.713
Well, why not?

32:25.131 --> 32:28.986
Yet by Saturday, you will feel more like yourself.

32:31.070 --> 32:32.841
What's got to be with you?

32:34.718 --> 32:37.010
What's going to happen who is going to look after you?

32:40.582 --> 32:42.698
Message from Hamburg, sir, is urgent.

32:43.624 --> 32:45.201
We are decoding it now.

32:51.001 --> 32:52.079
Read it

32:52.418 --> 32:54.090
"Proceed all possible speed.

32:54.126 --> 32:56.810
Situation in Havana are critical.

32:56.846 --> 32:59.495
A wave of anti-Semitism
is sweeping Cuba. "

33:35.383 --> 33:38.717
It is your responsibility to see that
The San Luis docks, Clasing.

33:38.753 --> 33:39.712
Oh Ja.

33:40.175 --> 33:41.585
My responsibility,

33:41.967 --> 33:44.966
but it was your agents who bribed the press.

33:45.259 --> 33:48.128
You stired up this strong anti-Semitism

33:48.343 --> 33:50.583
and now everything is my responsibility.

33:59.324 --> 34:00.100
Manuel.

34:00.137 --> 34:02.092
Luis, my friend, what a pleasure to see you.

34:02.429 --> 34:06.423
May I introduce to you my assistant, Hoffman.

34:06.805 --> 34:08.297
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

34:11.679 --> 34:13.837
- Your assistant, huh?
- Yes.

34:14.931 --> 34:18.514
His Excellency Manuel Benítez,
Director of Immigration.

34:18.551 --> 34:19.677
Please please.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.385
<i>Hi Michelle.</i>

34:25.933 --> 34:28.600
A beautiful girl The one with short hair.

34:29.141 --> 34:31.263
It's French, so she says.

34:31.766 --> 34:33.045
Would you like to know her?

34:36.976 --> 34:39.429
Manuel, we have an urgent problem.

34:40.393 --> 34:41.388
A problem?

34:41.851 --> 34:43.559
By Presidents Bru decree.

34:44.186 --> 34:46.065
The authorities tells Me

34:46.103 --> 34:49.478
that San Luis will not even be permitted to enter the harbour.

34:49.514 --> 34:50.386
Please.

34:50.645 --> 34:53.643
We have had nine presidents
in the last four years.

34:53.937 --> 34:57.884
The last one didn't even have time to go out the bathtub before He was deposed.

35:00.897 --> 35:02.094
Bru is no problem.

35:02.314 --> 35:04.518
But he has signed this decree.

35:05.064 --> 35:06.806
We must get Him to cancel it.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.177
We are wasting time.

35:10.482 --> 35:11.975
How much would it take to bribe him?

35:18.775 --> 35:19.521
<i>Waiter.</i>

35:21.984 --> 35:23.690
<i>Two more sodas, please.</i>

35:25.734 --> 35:28.235
You will not get very far in
Havana, Mr. Hoffman,

35:28.271 --> 35:30.272
If you presist in thinking like a tourist.

35:31.652 --> 35:33.975
You must learn to
Understand the Cuban mentality.

35:34.402 --> 35:35.812
Look what has already happened.

35:36.111 --> 35:38.783
First you tell us how disgusting these refugees are.

35:38.820 --> 35:42.020
Then you protest because we don't except them with open arms.

35:43.946 --> 35:44.755
Manuel.

35:48.196 --> 35:52.938
You guaranteed these
landing permits.

35:56.864 --> 36:00.115
Uptill now, your
asociation with my company,

36:00.151 --> 36:05.816
has been highly profitable

36:06.366 --> 36:08.819
but I don't see how it can continue.

36:09.741 --> 36:11.946
I have told you not to worry, Luis.

36:13.492 --> 36:16.159
Tell me, what's this famous decree called?

36:19.285 --> 36:20.192
What do you mean?

36:20.452 --> 36:22.857
Decree number nine hundred
thirty-seven.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.484
The exact number of
refugees on the ship.

36:26.327 --> 36:30.488
Yes, but the people on San Luis,

36:31.537 --> 36:32.917
If I understand you...

36:32.954 --> 36:34.876
No, no, no, that's the beauty of it you see.

36:34.912 --> 36:37.033
The Permits were issued on the 2 May.

36:37.663 --> 36:40.234
The decree was signed on 5
May, so, it can not affect them.

36:40.788 --> 36:44.699
The president has made his little gesture and nobody was harmed.

36:46.122 --> 36:48.872
The Cuban mentality.

37:03.292 --> 37:05.448
I must inform you of your legal right to remain silent

37:06.042 --> 37:09.408
but if you do so, this matter will be refered to a higher authority.

37:09.876 --> 37:11.535
I don't even know why I am here.

37:12.002 --> 37:13.965
You disobeyed my direct order

37:14.002 --> 37:16.704
against using this voyage to make political propaganda.

37:17.086 --> 37:18.591
As party representative...

37:18.628 --> 37:21.211
That gives you no Special privilege, Schiendick.

37:21.248 --> 37:23.996
Your record is filled
with complaints from passengers.

37:24.629 --> 37:27.378
In addition you made accusations against my officers

37:27.712 --> 37:30.877
you also incited other members of the crew to disobey orders.

37:31.338 --> 37:33.163
Under Maritime Law, that is mutiny.

37:35.422 --> 37:38.423
If I have been to officius in
My desire to serve the party.

37:38.459 --> 37:39.963
I warn you, Schiendick.

37:40.173 --> 37:41.666
one more complaint against you,

37:41.881 --> 37:43.754
and I will have you put ashore at the nearest port.

37:49.424 --> 37:50.419
Captain, I...

37:54.634 --> 37:56.376
Pardon.

37:57.801 --> 37:58.625
That's all.

38:14.762 --> 38:17.085
I think we should have gone to service, Carl.

38:17.304 --> 38:19.176
Mix more with others.

38:20.304 --> 38:21.928
I think we should have gone Karl.

38:24.305 --> 38:26.545
These are all part of it.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.717
Part of what?

38:31.806 --> 38:34.425
- Just wanted to check on who was there.
- Who?

38:37.557 --> 38:38.885
I don't believe that.

38:40.891 --> 38:43.012
The captain is trying to
make things easier for us

38:44.267 --> 38:45.594
Why? He is one of them.

38:53.513 --> 38:55.805
I thought I would take this in for Ana.

38:56.952 --> 38:58.411
As a surprise

38:59.454 --> 39:02.162
I could wear the mask for it.

39:06.018 --> 39:08.102
Don't you think she would look
pretty in it, Karl?

39:09.666 --> 39:14.771
All our letters, photographs,
Our private papers

39:17.064 --> 39:19.147
Our whole life
I was in that case.

39:24.149 --> 39:25.816
Well, they are gone now.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.547
Just things.

39:32.173 --> 39:34.152
Things can be replaced.

39:40.404 --> 39:42.279
It is better that they are lost.

39:42.593 --> 39:44.468
To start again without them.

39:46.553 --> 39:49.783
They just playing with us. We never get off this ship.

39:50.409 --> 39:52.701
Don't talk like that, Karl!

40:03.238 --> 40:05.312
We have years of beeing affraid.

40:07.197 --> 40:09.188
Years hoping for what.

40:10.197 --> 40:11.939
We sold everything to get away.

40:12.864 --> 40:15.697
But we will never escape if
We bring that fear with us.

40:15.990 --> 40:19.984
<i>You have to help me.I can't do everything on my own.</i>

40:26.283 --> 40:27.445
I can't.

40:29.951 --> 40:31.148
I can't.

40:32.701 --> 40:35.699
- I can't. I just can't.
- What's happened to Him?

40:37.077 --> 40:38.107
Mom. What happens?

40:38.369 --> 40:40.111
I want to help Him. I want to help Him.

40:43.536 --> 40:44.816
Let me go back with him.

40:45.245 --> 40:46.412
- Listen.
- Why is He crying?

40:46.448 --> 40:47.578
- What's the matter with Him?
- Listen to me.

40:47.615 --> 40:48.858
I have to reach him.

40:49.287 --> 40:52.308
He is retreating into himself. You understand?

40:52.345 --> 40:53.168
Y never seen Him cry before.

40:53.204 --> 40:57.330
If you want to help him, go up there, find some Young people and make friends.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.451
- Mom.
- If he sees that you are happy,

40:59.622 --> 41:01.032
Thats going to help Him.

41:01.456 --> 41:02.997
I can't stand to see him cry.

41:04.956 --> 41:05.786
Dont worry.

41:06.540 --> 41:07.535
Come on.

41:19.834 --> 41:20.947
It's Lili.

41:21.626 --> 41:22.704
It's Lili.

41:24.876 --> 41:28.242
I'm sorry my darling I didn't mean to speak to you like this.

41:30.377 --> 41:31.918
Carl, this is a ship.

41:32.669 --> 41:34.707
It's just a ship, it is not a prison.

41:35.003 --> 41:36.377
We're the lucky ones.

41:39.170 --> 41:42.038
In just a few days,
We are going to be in Havana.

41:42.504 --> 41:44.211
And then We will be in America.

41:45.463 --> 41:49.510
And We can walk down the streets,
and no one will even look at us.

41:51.089 --> 41:53.874
And while you're getting well again,
I just find work.

41:54.381 --> 41:55.578
And so can Ana.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.787
You'll see, Carl, it will be a good life then.

42:01.716 --> 42:02.913
And no one...

42:04.758 --> 42:06.832
No one will ever hurt you again.

42:35.763 --> 42:36.793
What are you thinking?

42:40.347 --> 42:41.509
Just thinking.

42:45.556 --> 42:46.551
Of what?

42:48.932 --> 42:50.306
The past, is the past.

42:52.474 --> 42:55.556
Do you remember what you said a new life had been giving to both of us?

43:08.601 --> 43:09.596
Egon

43:22.187 --> 43:23.182
What's wrong?

43:24.604 --> 43:26.346
I'm just tired, thats all.

43:37.481 --> 43:38.809
You're lovely.

43:43.941 --> 43:45.398
I see what it is thats wrong.

43:47.650 --> 43:49.226
You still think of that Girl.

43:50.317 --> 43:51.561
Denise, please.

44:03.194 --> 44:04.272
The great...

44:06.194 --> 44:07.604
Egon Kreisler

44:09.945 --> 44:11.521
So cool.

44:14.404 --> 44:15.648
So detached

44:19.488 --> 44:20.898
In search of youth.

44:21.613 --> 44:23.023
Stop it, Denise!

44:24.281 --> 44:25.478
There was no love in it.

44:30.948 --> 44:34.445
You don't understand it,
was not like with us.

44:35.741 --> 44:37.115
I was a trophy for her.

44:44.867 --> 44:46.111
Didn't you love her?

44:47.951 --> 44:48.946
No.

44:59.911 --> 45:01.073
Do You love Me?

45:06.079 --> 45:07.074
We are together.

45:19.206 --> 45:21.695
It's cold for you, Joseph, come We go.

45:49.419 --> 45:50.414
Hello.

45:52.087 --> 45:53.081
Hello.

45:59.171 --> 46:00.581
Did you see the Azores?

46:02.088 --> 46:03.415
No no.

46:05.547 --> 46:07.123
How is your father? Is He better?

46:09.298 --> 46:12.664
- Why? Do they talk about him?
- No.

46:12.965 --> 46:13.960
No.

46:14.924 --> 46:15.954
No no.

46:19.008 --> 46:20.086
It is just that...

46:21.050 --> 46:22.792
My mother is very...

46:23.675 --> 46:25.880
Well, we are very worried.

46:26.759 --> 46:28.584
If you think He is really Ill

46:29.218 --> 46:31.209
the authorities in
Cuba might send Him back.

46:33.093 --> 46:34.670
Why would they send Him back?

46:36.385 --> 46:37.380
Well...

46:42.386 --> 46:43.417
You wont anything?

46:43.720 --> 46:45.094
No no!

46:45.762 --> 46:46.840
I promise.

46:50.179 --> 46:51.589
For the last two years,

46:53.347 --> 46:55.468
My Father has been handled by The Gestapo.

46:57.014 --> 46:58.044
The Gestapo

47:01.264 --> 47:03.090
Don't tell you what it is been like.

47:04.015 --> 47:05.129
What do they do?

47:05.932 --> 47:07.010
He was a lawyer.

47:09.974 --> 47:11.053
Everybody liked him.

47:13.725 --> 47:15.763
When Jews where not allowed to work anymore,

47:20.559 --> 47:22.136
Didn't see Him for months.

47:26.102 --> 47:29.136
Each time I saw Him, I couldn't
Believe how much He changed.

47:29.477 --> 47:30.307
Someone is coming!

47:42.605 --> 47:44.813
Would you get into trouble if seen talking to Me?

47:44.850 --> 47:46.639
Yeah...

47:48.397 --> 47:49.771
I was... Thinking of You.

47:52.064 --> 47:52.853
Me?

47:59.774 --> 48:01.350
I'll better be going anyway.

48:02.399 --> 48:03.643
Uhm.. might I see you tomorrow

48:05.150 --> 48:06.477
I'm not going anywhere.

48:09.109 --> 48:10.187
I meant here.

48:10.901 --> 48:11.849
Right here?

48:15.652 --> 48:16.398
Yes.

48:17.652 --> 48:18.730
Yes if you want to.

48:21.778 --> 48:24.729
Well goodbye then, Max.

48:28.154 --> 48:29.563
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

48:56.867 --> 48:59.320
- Are these children of yours?
- My daughters sir.

48:59.534 --> 49:01.857
- They have landing permits?
- And visas.

49:01.972 --> 49:02.748
Good.

49:02.784 --> 49:05.535
Issued three weeks ago by
the Cuban consulate in Hamburg.

49:05.571 --> 49:06.862
- Good.
- And signed.

49:07.743 --> 49:10.861
And the landing permits ought to bin hmm...

49:11.953 --> 49:13.262
what is your name?
- Benitez.

49:13.299 --> 49:14.572
The man is a thief you know.

49:15.516 --> 49:16.292
A thief?

49:16.328 --> 49:19.501
Giving out landing permits to refugees,

49:19.537 --> 49:23.282
Not just streching the Law,
is making a fortune.

49:23.496 --> 49:28.569
And also making the hopeless mistake by not sharing
the profits with right people.

49:28.664 --> 49:31.153
I stay on the black, dear.

49:32.914 --> 49:33.945
<i>It doesn't go anymore.</i>

49:34.164 --> 49:36.404
Lets Say, doctor...

49:36.957 --> 49:38.236
- Strauss.
- Strauss, yes.

49:39.457 --> 49:41.946
These Children of yours could come ashore,

49:43.958 --> 49:47.288
Do you have enough
money to support them?

50:00.377 --> 50:03.578
We have our
fascists in Cuba also.

50:04.669 --> 50:08.746
I apose them, because
they do a petty small manual.

50:09.712 --> 50:10.874
They abuse their power.

50:11.546 --> 50:14.579
I think we can honer your visas.

50:15.505 --> 50:18.254
If necessary, I
I will pose the guarantee.

50:18.797 --> 50:20.338
I can't thank you enough , sir.

50:20.547 --> 50:21.293
Please.

50:25.298 --> 50:27.372
Something still troubeling your mind,
doctor?

50:28.257 --> 50:29.252
Well...

50:29.882 --> 50:33.295
People are sayin the St Luis might not be allowed,
even to enter the harbour.

50:33.591 --> 50:36.838
I have three hundred tons of
sugar consigned to Her

50:37.091 --> 50:40.592
and a portion of the profits,
Which will go to the right people.

50:40.628 --> 50:43.295
I am a businessman.
I take precautions.

50:43.676 --> 50:44.955
What about the passengers?

50:45.259 --> 50:49.384
I shall use what influence I have.

50:53.386 --> 50:54.381
So its certain?

50:54.761 --> 50:59.633
In Havana, doctor, the only thing
that one can be certain of is...

51:01.929 --> 51:02.924
a cigar.

51:13.306 --> 51:14.301
Hello Berg.

51:14.889 --> 51:15.895
Can I have a word with you?

51:15.931 --> 51:18.052
No. I'm sorry, Schiendick,
I don't have time.

51:18.265 --> 51:19.426
Wow

51:20.390 --> 51:21.800
Thats not very friendly.

51:23.224 --> 51:25.262
These are strange times, Berg.

51:25.974 --> 51:29.387
You know its my job to make sure the partys influence is been mantained.

51:29.808 --> 51:30.803
It is not always easy.

51:32.059 --> 51:33.884
- We should help each other.
- What do you want?

51:35.476 --> 51:38.427
As party representative
I have to know whats going on.

51:38.768 --> 51:40.344
And, what does it have to do with me?

51:41.435 --> 51:42.441
Well,

51:42.477 --> 51:45.399
you are a close friend of the captains steward, Max Gunter,

51:45.436 --> 51:48.476
I mean He must hear things, have a quick look at the radio messages.

51:48.512 --> 51:51.517
- Wait a minute, you ask me to spy...
- In your own interest, Berg.

51:52.687 --> 51:54.512
I have to keep a look out for subversives.

51:56.188 --> 51:59.105
And your close friend, Max
Gunter, is a Jew lover,

51:59.141 --> 52:02.022
Do you know what that means? You know the Nurnberger racial laws?

52:02.058 --> 52:04.309
And I've seen you crawling to them too.

52:05.231 --> 52:08.064
Well if its a choice between them and you,
I know what to take.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.099
I have witnesses for that.

52:13.691 --> 52:16.772
Do you think I care!
The Hell with you and your party!

52:18.566 --> 52:21.600
After all your promises,
you just make life not worth living.

52:22.150 --> 52:24.935
Threats, spying on each other.

52:25.151 --> 52:26.348
I'm sick of it!

52:27.068 --> 52:29.770
Maybe the others are
afraid to tell you, but I'm not.

52:34.611 --> 52:36.317
You are on my list.

53:03.365 --> 53:04.360
Egon

53:05.574 --> 53:09.106
Those men with the saved heads, are they criminals?

53:11.950 --> 53:13.194
They are teachers.

53:13.784 --> 53:14.862
I have talked with them.

53:16.742 --> 53:18.568
Their only crime is they are Jews.

53:55.374 --> 53:56.404
Oh excuse me.

54:05.000 --> 54:05.995
It is shameful.

54:06.751 --> 54:09.583
They are everywhere.
Like animals in the field.

54:10.085 --> 54:11.079
It's natural.

54:12.252 --> 54:14.326
How do they know which of them are Nazis?

54:15.502 --> 54:17.623
They are young. They are afraid

54:19.044 --> 54:20.870
They make love as an escape.

54:21.878 --> 54:23.371
It is an affirmation of life.

54:23.753 --> 54:26.207
For God's sake, Egon, I know that.

54:29.504 --> 54:32.373
<i>- Man overboard!
- Man overboard!</i>

54:33.963 --> 54:34.958
<i>Man overboard!</i>

54:37.839 --> 54:38.602
Bridge.

54:38.714 --> 54:40.088
Man overboard. Port side, sir.

54:40.298 --> 54:41.956
Man overboard, sir. Port side

54:42.173 --> 54:43.251
Standby to go hard about.

54:57.092 --> 54:58.254
Was it a passenger?

54:58.801 --> 55:01.918
I saw him jump, it was Berg, Heinz
Berg, from the engine room.

55:03.427 --> 55:04.291
A sailor?

55:05.552 --> 55:08.109
Even if he is still alive, he will be
miles behind by now

55:08.145 --> 55:10.666
There is no change of finding Him in the dark.

55:11.761 --> 55:12.756
Poor Berg.

55:59.727 --> 56:00.722
Herr. Clasing.

56:02.603 --> 56:03.847
Herr. Goldsmith.

56:04.145 --> 56:07.392
This Morris Troper, head
of the Jewish Agency in Europe.

56:07.687 --> 56:10.934
Luis Clasing, director
of the Hamburg-Amerika line here.

56:11.604 --> 56:14.638
- You are American, Herr. Troper?
- Yes, a thirsty one.

56:14.855 --> 56:15.850
Of course.

56:16.188 --> 56:17.302
Please sit down

56:19.647 --> 56:21.804
- What would you like?
- A cold beer, please.

56:22.148 --> 56:24.352
- And you, Herr Goldsmith?
- The same please.

56:25.190 --> 56:27.311
<i>- Two cold beers, please.
- Yes sir.</i>

56:28.941 --> 56:32.354
- When did you arrive?
- At two O'clock this morning.

56:32.858 --> 56:34.730
- You must be tired.
- No.

56:36.692 --> 56:40.188
I understand you have come from Pariss.

56:40.484 --> 56:42.060
Lovely city Paris.

56:43.693 --> 56:46.146
<i>- Lottery?
- No no no. Thank you.</i>

56:46.860 --> 56:48.057
No no no. Thank you.

56:49.110 --> 56:50.105
Mr. Clasing.

56:51.361 --> 56:52.116
<i>Lottery?</i>

56:52.153 --> 56:53.397
I like some straight answers.

56:54.945 --> 56:56.059
Regarding what?

56:57.153 --> 56:58.492
Landing permits

56:58.529 --> 57:01.065
that your company supplied to the passengers of the St Luis.

57:02.613 --> 57:04.568
They are not worth the paper
they are written on.

57:05.572 --> 57:08.321
They are of limited value, Yes.

57:08.614 --> 57:12.939
But they are aducate for permitting the passengers to come ashore.

57:15.490 --> 57:16.319
Thats definate?

57:17.407 --> 57:21.318
I have the personal word of the director of Immigration.

57:22.116 --> 57:26.110
Benítez,  Immigration Chief,
He has no mark for honesty.

57:32.201 --> 57:37.274
- He's a politician, Herr. Goldsmith.
- I dont like it.

57:38.994 --> 57:42.111
All of a Sudden a thousand Jews are allowed to leave Germany.

57:42.619 --> 57:43.408
Why?

57:45.370 --> 57:47.574
- Why?
- It was a gesture.

57:47.995 --> 57:50.235
- The beginning of a thaw Morris.
- Yes?

57:50.454 --> 57:51.543
And as soon as they sail

57:51.579 --> 57:55.620
this Nazi propaganda starts, in Europe, in al the Americas.

57:56.497 --> 57:58.322
- Why is that?
- Why?

57:58.830 --> 58:01.002
You people are so suspicious,

58:01.039 --> 58:03.294
Always looking for
hidden meaning.

58:03.331 --> 58:06.373
Listen you people taught us with guns, and clubs,

58:06.410 --> 58:07.783
With concentration camps.

58:08.665 --> 58:10.075
There is no need to be offensive.

58:10.707 --> 58:11.702
Clasing

58:12.624 --> 58:16.204
All I know there is something rotten here and Im going to find out what it is.

58:16.791 --> 58:18.829
I'm afraid I can't help you, Herr. Troper,

58:19.250 --> 58:21.288
I'm only a shipping agent.

58:21.501 --> 58:22.531
Good Day gentlemen.

58:27.918 --> 58:31.580
<i>I will permit the St. Louis
to anchor to be serviced.</i>

58:35.420 --> 58:37.706
You surprise me, my dear Remoss.

58:38.503 --> 58:41.585
You supported the decision very warmly at first.

58:41.921 --> 58:44.046
Because I was a way of stopping Benitez

58:44.082 --> 58:45.871
and put an end to his raketering.

58:46.505 --> 58:49.797
But I have not taken into account the moral issues.

58:49.833 --> 58:51.373
I have noticed before

58:51.589 --> 58:54.256
You sometimes confuse what is Moral and what is practical.

58:56.548 --> 58:58.954
We have no obligation to those people.

59:00.007 --> 59:02.875
Their permits to land are only legal for tourists.

59:03.716 --> 59:06.039
If I know it straight out the imagination,

59:06.966 --> 59:10.333
can refugees be forced to leave their own country,

59:11.050 --> 59:12.840
be considered as tourists.

59:13.301 --> 59:15.043
What about General Batista?

59:15.468 --> 59:17.838
It is said that he is in favor of them landing.

59:18.760 --> 59:21.194
I shall soon be in a better position not

59:21.230 --> 59:23.628
to care one way or  the another.

59:23.844 --> 59:27.839
He will wait to see what you decide and do exactly the opposite.

59:28.220 --> 59:30.507
And there is also the American attitude to consider

59:31.887 --> 59:33.131
Batista and Roosevelt.

59:33.971 --> 59:36.460
The two ringmasters of Cuban politics.

59:38.471 --> 59:43.094
Batista will say nothing, because He is affraid of loosing his popularity.

59:44.264 --> 59:47.677
As for Roosevelt, he also has
elections coming

59:48.056 --> 59:50.296
and rising unemployment in America.

59:50.610 --> 59:53.631
Like me, He will study the situation.

59:53.841 --> 59:56.445
And do what is politically inexpedient.

59:59.676 --> 01:00:01.551
My conscience is clear.

01:00:01.969 --> 01:00:03.949
I have acted throughout.

01:00:04.262 --> 01:00:06.450
And I will continue to act...

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:10.514
only the best interest of the people of Cuba.

01:00:47.293 --> 01:00:48.856
American music, Egon.

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.045
How appropriate

01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:18.134
Mr. Josef.

01:01:18.135 --> 01:01:21.885
May I complement you your... costume, Mrs. Kreisler?

01:01:22.511 --> 01:01:24.283
Somewhat over dressed perhaps.

01:01:58.768 --> 01:02:00.331
May I have the honor of
this dance, Miss Rosen?

01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:01.374
No!

01:02:03.563 --> 01:02:06.376
She has promised this dance to Me.

01:02:18.358 --> 01:02:19.712
Mrs. Rosen?

01:02:20.234 --> 01:02:21.693
Would you care to dance?

01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:23.569
Yes.

01:03:52.096 --> 01:03:52.926
Surprise.

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.138
I thought you wherent gonna come.

01:04:02.848 --> 01:04:04.127
We should be in there.

01:04:05.348 --> 01:04:06.462
Can't you sneak in?

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:08.385
No.

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:10.171
I am not allowed to.

01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:13.307
Dress you up like a bandit.

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:16.264
Put a mask over your face.

01:04:19.642 --> 01:04:23.091
Just think day after tomorrow, we will be in Havana.

01:04:25.727 --> 01:04:26.722
Yes.

01:04:30.352 --> 01:04:32.225
I tried to watch you dancing.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.013
- Did you see Me?
- Yes.

01:04:37.937 --> 01:04:39.099
Made you jealous?

01:04:39.729 --> 01:04:41.831
I wouldn't tell you if I was.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.475
Ana.

01:04:50.356 --> 01:04:51.386
There is...

01:04:52.064 --> 01:04:56.687
There is something... something that Id like to tell you.

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:00.394
Its...

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:03.763
I know.

01:05:04.816 --> 01:05:07.305
Wants we get to Havanna Il go ashore and you...

01:07:42.717 --> 01:07:46.166
<i>Vienna, Vienna,</i>

01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:53.126
<i>only you are the city</i>

01:07:56.011 --> 01:07:59.792
<i>of my dreams.</i>

01:08:01.887 --> 01:08:06.675
<i>City of old buildings</i>

01:08:10.972 --> 01:08:16.921
<i>and of lovely women.</i>

01:08:20.432 --> 01:08:23.631
<i>Vienna, Vienna,</i>

01:08:24.474 --> 01:08:30.258
<i>only you are the city</i>

01:08:33.725 --> 01:08:36.594
<i>of my dreams.</i>

01:08:39.602 --> 01:08:45.823
<i>The city where I am lucky and happy.</i>

01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:55.220
<i>It's Vienna, it's Vienna.</i>

01:08:58.688 --> 01:09:04.853
<i>My Vienna</i>

01:09:19.483 --> 01:09:20.645
That's curious.

01:09:20.858 --> 01:09:22.020
Those Jews...

01:09:23.524 --> 01:09:24.769
They miss Germany.

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:26.604
And why not?

01:09:28.818 --> 01:09:31.389
After all, they are Germans.

01:09:48.113 --> 01:09:50.947
Do some Cuban music, something Fast and Gay . A conga

01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:52.404
- Yes,Madam.
- Play a conga.

01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:53.229
A conga

01:12:52.184 --> 01:12:53.179
Who is it?

01:12:53.518 --> 01:12:56.267
<i>Dr. Glauner May l
see you for a moment?</i>

01:12:58.269 --> 01:12:59.299
Don't go away.

01:13:06.603 --> 01:13:07.598
Surtantly.

01:13:09.729 --> 01:13:12.265
Professor Weiler has just died.

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.812
Why do you need Me?

01:13:15.522 --> 01:13:19.155
The captain would like you to,
verify the cause of death.

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:31.769
I am coming.

01:13:40.817 --> 01:13:42.643
Yes, I agree with your diagnosis.

01:13:43.985 --> 01:13:47.564
From what you have told me it
was a masive coronary occlusion.

01:13:58.487 --> 01:14:00.278
Doctors!

01:14:04.175 --> 01:14:07.446
My husband died because
of broken heart.

01:14:13.156 --> 01:14:18.610
If you would excuse me, I would like,
to be alone with my husband.

01:14:19.115 --> 01:14:20.313
Thank you Captain.

01:14:24.658 --> 01:14:26.032
Doctor Thank you.

01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.784
You wanted to see me, captain?

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:20.912
How did you know?

01:15:22.209 --> 01:15:25.954
Well, the doctor’s Glauner diagnosis did not need any confirmation.

01:15:28.877 --> 01:15:32.741
Have you seen the friget birds this afternoon? We are very close to shore.

01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:39.038
- Why did you want to see Me?
- Because I have confidence in you.

01:15:40.545 --> 01:15:42.583
I received a message, about an hour ago.

01:15:43.087 --> 01:15:45.374
from the chief of
Hamburg-Amerika in Havana.

01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:47.995
The Cuban president has decreed

01:15:48.213 --> 01:15:51.212
that the St. Louis is in
violating of Cuban law.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.501
You mean uh...

01:16:00.215 --> 01:16:01.838
They might deny entry?

01:16:03.882 --> 01:16:06.797
- I doubt it will come to that.
- What are your plans?

01:16:07.216 --> 01:16:09.503
I would like to form a committee of passenger

01:16:10.509 --> 01:16:14.005
who I could consult and who would confirm with Me to prevent panic.

01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:18.134
Would you head that committee?

01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:22.628
Professor, I need someone who would be respected by your people.

01:16:23.094 --> 01:16:27.468
I'm so sorry, captain,
I am not the right man for that job.

01:16:31.637 --> 01:16:35.714
But, of course, I'm at
Your disposal whenever you need me.

01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:39.257
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:17:56.979 --> 01:18:00.521
My dear Mr. Troper
I do wish you sit down?

01:18:00.522 --> 01:18:02.814
And try to understand that the fact

01:18:02.815 --> 01:18:05.524
that the ship will be permitted now

01:18:05.525 --> 01:18:07.401
Into the Harbour,is a step forward.

01:18:07.402 --> 01:18:11.361
The things move in Cuba slowly, step by step.

01:18:11.362 --> 01:18:12.612
Yes, I know, manana.

01:18:12.613 --> 01:18:17.093
That does not nearly mean tomorrow, Mr. Tropar.

01:18:17.094 --> 01:18:22.303
"Manana" is a whole
philosophical condition

01:18:23.971 --> 01:18:28.659
You really should try to
Understand the Cubans mind.

01:18:29.285 --> 01:18:30.952
Everybody tells me that.

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:36.683
But I do understand the Germans mind.

01:18:43.144 --> 01:18:49.291
We must all of us do everything in our power to
Help those poor people on the boat.

01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:53.876
Of course.

01:18:55.127 --> 01:18:56.481
Can you get Me,
 a meeting with the President?

01:18:57.003 --> 01:19:01.483
I would have to suggest a
unic reason

01:19:01.484 --> 01:19:04.714
What about 937 reasons ?!

01:19:05.861 --> 01:19:07.841
What the hell is happening here ?!

01:19:09.821 --> 01:19:12.842
Klasing, he says he acted in good faith!

01:19:13.364 --> 01:19:15.031
Goldsmit is worn out!

01:19:15.241 --> 01:19:16.908
Benitez wants more money!

01:19:17.117 --> 01:19:18.680
Batista waits on the sideline!

01:19:18.785 --> 01:19:21.181
Bru is not available.
And you say "Manana"!

01:19:23.579 --> 01:19:27.329
The only thing I have been offered on this
Island are bananas, cigars and whores.

01:19:27.643 --> 01:19:30.664
We are a poor country and
We must sell what we have.

01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:33.061
Including your politicians?

01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:35.667
No, Mr. Troper...

01:19:35.668 --> 01:19:38.273
You don't honestly believe that...

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:40.982
Cuba has a monopoly
on corruption

01:19:43.484 --> 01:19:47.755
You can afford to be more or less sophisticated.

01:19:47.756 --> 01:19:53.382
And we with our primitive metality must be more or less open.

01:19:54.842 --> 01:19:57.238
It is really very simple.

01:20:00.365 --> 01:20:05.991
Your Jews... are for sale.

01:20:08.075 --> 01:20:12.347
Their lives is a matter...

01:20:12.765 --> 01:20:14.432
of negotiation

01:20:29.227 --> 01:20:30.894
As simple as that.

01:20:34.645 --> 01:20:38.083
The lives of 937 people.

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:41.731
Just a commodity, like everyone elses.

01:20:51.003 --> 01:20:52.774
How do I start the bidding?

01:20:53.713 --> 01:20:59.026
Well you noticed what the President said when
He decided not to admit the refugees?

01:20:59.027 --> 01:21:02.674
It would be an intolerable burden on the economy.

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:05.905
And that's where He offered you your opening.

01:21:06.739 --> 01:21:08.823
Your approch should be that your agency...

01:21:09.136 --> 01:21:12.158
is prepared to put up a large part

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:18.306
sufficiently large part to cover the living expenses for these people.

01:21:19.661 --> 01:21:24.037
For... what... Six months?

01:21:24.142 --> 01:21:26.017
AND...

01:21:27.164 --> 01:21:29.769
those considerations would make them...

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:34.354
welcome as guests instead of  a charity case?

01:21:41.752 --> 01:21:43.419
Whats the opening bid?

01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:01.058
Look. Look to the land.

01:22:10.401 --> 01:22:12.475
I can not see. I can not see.

01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:18.556
What are they looking at?

01:22:19.819 --> 01:22:21.561
Havana overthere, look.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:01.569
The harbor pilot, sir.

01:23:03.243 --> 01:23:06.111
I am to take you in to the Hamburg-Amerika pier senor.

01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:09.942
You may Dock there to refuel
and then you must anchor out in the harbor.

01:23:10.744 --> 01:23:11.486
Why?

01:23:12.077 --> 01:23:13.654
I'm only carrying out orders, senor.

01:23:15.453 --> 01:23:17.465
Very well. It is yours.

01:23:29.955 --> 01:23:34.246
- Can you see your children?
- No, it's too far.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:49.866
Egon, do you know something?

01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:52.453
This is not Berlin.

01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:56.913
I'm afraid not.

01:23:59.793 --> 01:24:01.583
I can't wait to get ashore.

01:24:02.169 --> 01:24:03.924
- You have a daughter here, haven't you?
- Yes.

01:24:03.961 --> 01:24:06.663
Yes, it has been nearly a year.
She teaches languages.

01:24:32.049 --> 01:24:34.591
- Captain Schroeder, please.
- Come on, sir.

01:24:34.627 --> 01:24:35.586
<i>Pass, pass</i>

01:24:41.634 --> 01:24:44.048
I'm with him, I am
Mr. Clasing's assistant.

01:24:44.084 --> 01:24:46.463
- Yes, yes, do you have identification?
- Sure.

01:24:50.927 --> 01:24:53.083
This for a German newspaper "Der Stuhrmer".

01:24:54.052 --> 01:24:56.624
Yes, I represent the paper aswell "Hapag".

01:24:56.844 --> 01:24:58.558
I'm sorry, you can not board senor,

01:24:58.595 --> 01:25:00.882
only those with a passes
issued by Cuban authorities.

01:25:03.179 --> 01:25:05.170
Can I have one of the crew brought to Me?

01:25:05.638 --> 01:25:08.930
Contact is forbidden between anyone on the ship, and whom comes to it.

01:25:08.966 --> 01:25:09.962
You must leave.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.628
You See, I only want to give these magazines to a friend.

01:25:14.556 --> 01:25:17.673
It's worth quite a lot.

01:25:35.267 --> 01:25:37.673
Hey you! Hey Steward!

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:43.306
I'm Robert Hoffman,
friend of Otto Schiendick.

01:25:44.019 --> 01:25:45.974
Will you Please get him to me. Quick.

01:25:47.103 --> 01:25:48.761
Otto Schiendick, please.

01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:50.383
<i>Hey, what's up here?</i>

01:25:56.479 --> 01:25:59.643
Gunter, was there someone from the Hamburg-Amerika line?

01:25:59.855 --> 01:26:02.011
Yes, he said his name was Hoffman.

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.727
- He asked for you.
- And why didn't send for Me?

01:26:06.763 --> 01:26:09.474
- It was your duty to send for Me.
- There was no time.

01:26:10.065 --> 01:26:11.771
Anyway the police moved Him of the pier.

01:26:12.982 --> 01:26:14.475
You think you are very clever, don't you?

01:26:15.107 --> 01:26:17.182
Someone special, captains steward.

01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:20.439
I've been watching you, Gunter.

01:26:30.776 --> 01:26:33.348
You are the man behind al that rubbish?

01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:35.098
I beg your pardon.

01:26:35.819 --> 01:26:37.229
Your comunications

01:26:37.944 --> 01:26:41.310
A collection of half-truths,
warnings, evasions.

01:26:41.528 --> 01:26:44.859
Captain, I understand
and I simpasize

01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:48.484
I have no pleasure
In this terrible bussines.

01:26:48.738 --> 01:26:51.902
This is why I came to explain
to you as much as I could.

01:26:52.113 --> 01:26:54.863
Yes, I do have the right to know
What this is all about.

01:26:55.072 --> 01:26:56.067
I listened.

01:26:57.948 --> 01:27:00.906
Passengers landing permits non-valid.

01:27:00.943 --> 01:27:01.901
Non valid!

01:27:02.157 --> 01:27:04.079
Unfortunately this is true.

01:27:04.115 --> 01:27:07.030
They order was signed just before
you left Hamburg.

01:27:07.324 --> 01:27:08.900
Then why where we permitted to sail?

01:27:09.449 --> 01:27:10.444
You see.

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:14.409
Mr. Benítez, the official
who signed the orders,

01:27:14.445 --> 01:27:17.742
assured us it would not apply in this case.

01:27:17.779 --> 01:27:19.366
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:24.285
But now we can't get
in toucht with Mr. Benítez.

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:27.319
He hides himself, He will not answer telephone calls.

01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:29.368
And what have you done about it?

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:31.692
- I?
- Yes.

01:27:33.245 --> 01:27:36.611
I tried to call him.
What can I do?

01:27:36.996 --> 01:27:39.954
Captain, if you had any
idea of my problems...

01:27:39.991 --> 01:27:42.210
Your problems are not My concern, Mr. Clasing,

01:27:42.246 --> 01:27:44.700
al I want is to get my passengers ashore.

01:27:46.205 --> 01:27:50.947
You know, captain. You can think of it this way.

01:27:51.581 --> 01:27:54.496
You have landed your ship
in Havana harbor.

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:56.615
Your part of this voyage is over.

01:27:57.416 --> 01:27:59.656
The passengers are no longer your concern.

01:28:00.166 --> 01:28:01.540
Think of it another way.

01:28:02.833 --> 01:28:04.030
They are Jews.

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:06.621
Perhaps they can walk on water.

01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:12.709
These people, sir
Clasing, whether Jews or not,

01:28:14.002 --> 01:28:16.751
are my responsibility
until they leave this ship.

01:28:17.502 --> 01:28:18.616
Never forget that.

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.204
Now, get of my ship!

01:28:21.545 --> 01:28:23.452
Get my passengers to Havana!

01:28:23.795 --> 01:28:25.626
And in Gods name, be quick about it.

01:28:49.132 --> 01:28:51.586
- Captain, I'll get this finished for you.
- Thank you.

01:29:02.093 --> 01:29:04.177
Keep looking, maybe
Your father is there.

01:29:04.213 --> 01:29:05.049
You think so?

01:29:13.303 --> 01:29:15.294
There are my children.

01:29:16.053 --> 01:29:17.251
Dieter!

01:29:17.512 --> 01:29:18.674
Helga!

01:29:23.676 --> 01:29:24.926
Dieter!

01:29:25.135 --> 01:29:26.490
Helga!

01:30:35.046 --> 01:30:36.207
Mr. Estedes.

01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:40.650
- Doctor...
- Strauss.

01:30:41.067 --> 01:30:42.542
Strauss, of course.

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:46.892
It's no consulation, but...

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.902
now I'm told even with the fullest Visas

01:30:50.939 --> 01:30:53.000
They will not be allowed to come ashore.

01:30:53.465 --> 01:30:56.211
But You said there would be room, if the right people where taken care of.
of them the right person.

01:30:56.248 --> 01:31:00.937
Yes, but in this case the only
right person is the president

01:31:01.487 --> 01:31:06.147
and he is engaged in what you call it a came of cat and  mouse.

01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:08.236
Why don't you wear your glasses?

01:31:08.488 --> 01:31:11.447
But you said there were other people
powerfull enough to do something.

01:31:11.484 --> 01:31:13.276
Batista is...

01:31:13.698 --> 01:31:15.356
In the shadow watching.

01:31:15.948 --> 01:31:19.646
I will fear He will play the Cat and the President is the mouse.

01:31:20.324 --> 01:31:21.699
And the foreign secretary?

01:31:21.735 --> 01:31:22.943
Oars

01:31:24.116 --> 01:31:27.178
A man of compassion.

01:31:27.242 --> 01:31:28.584
How do you think

01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:31.943
A man of compassion.

01:31:34.576 --> 01:31:37.503
Perhaps your only true hope.

01:31:39.785 --> 01:31:41.236
But but.

01:31:44.161 --> 01:31:47.401
Like all the rest, he will see no one.

01:31:49.579 --> 01:31:51.949
I'm afraid, thats how it is, doctor Strauss.

01:31:52.246 --> 01:31:54.995
- You gave me your word.
- I know I did, I did.

01:32:00.705 --> 01:32:02.492
It is all I can do.

01:32:03.164 --> 01:32:04.954
- Who is it please?
- Someone...

01:32:05.873 --> 01:32:09.654
with no importance but has
Many contacts in the Government.

01:32:10.249 --> 01:32:11.962
It's against al the odds, but...

01:32:11.999 --> 01:32:14.227
when there is nothing left
to lose, we must...

01:32:14.264 --> 01:32:16.457
bet on the long shot, don't you agree?

01:32:17.416 --> 01:32:20.201
Mr. Estedes, I have not seen my children for nearly 2 years.

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:22.583
I know, I know, doctor.

01:32:25.334 --> 01:32:29.960
This whole thing is more serious than I thought.

01:32:29.997 --> 01:32:30.991
Ricardo.

01:32:32.127 --> 01:32:33.834
When a man like our president

01:32:34.919 --> 01:32:38.700
neglets business for politics,

01:32:40.378 --> 01:32:44.037
the time has come
of investing abroad.

01:33:18.419 --> 01:33:21.232
Well, when I said I report you I mean...

01:33:21.858 --> 01:33:23.213
I do not have to.

01:33:23.526 --> 01:33:24.672
It depends.

01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:26.132
On what?

01:33:26.445 --> 01:33:29.258
I want to know what else is said
at the committee meeting.

01:33:33.323 --> 01:33:36.136
There must have been more,
you were there What else did the captain say?

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:39.783
Would you like a piece of Strudel?

01:33:42.493 --> 01:33:43.535
It's good.

01:33:43.744 --> 01:33:45.724
What did the captain say?

01:33:45.725 --> 01:33:46.975
Oh yeah.

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:50.206
He said He is stopping shore leave.

01:33:53.332 --> 01:33:54.686
¿Stopped? when?

01:33:54.688 --> 01:33:56.146
As from now.

01:33:59.689 --> 01:34:01.356
He Can't do that.

01:34:02.608 --> 01:34:03.754
How long for?

01:34:03.963 --> 01:34:06.984
He said that if passengers couldn't go ashore, neither could the crew.

01:35:16.196 --> 01:35:18.863
Help! They won't hurt me!

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:20.977
They won't catch me!

01:35:21.363 --> 01:35:22.560
Not me!

01:35:25.614 --> 01:35:27.901
Not me! They won't catch me!

01:35:32.323 --> 01:35:33.520
They won't catch me!

01:35:36.866 --> 01:35:38.323
They won't catch me!

01:35:43.992 --> 01:35:45.070
<i>Get away!</i>

01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:49.399
Father!

01:36:03.787 --> 01:36:05.328
No! Please mom!

01:36:27.999 --> 01:36:29.243
Save Him!

01:38:27.894 --> 01:38:30.892
He says tourists are about
animals and that this is the way...

01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:39.932
Feels stuck.

01:38:41.688 --> 01:38:42.849
Give Me a hand, will you?

01:38:44.813 --> 01:38:47.053
Oh Yes, the chain has coth in your hair.

01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:51.684
Just pull it

01:38:52.773 --> 01:38:55.096
- Well I do not want to hurt you.
- Give it a tug.

01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.808
Give me a cigarette, please.

01:39:15.943 --> 01:39:18.895
I understand you waited for me.

01:39:19.944 --> 01:39:21.022
Yes.

01:39:22.194 --> 01:39:23.438
I had to see you.

01:39:24.861 --> 01:39:26.023
I'm flattered.

01:39:35.155 --> 01:39:36.482
Make yourself comfortable.

01:39:43.323 --> 01:39:45.065
You prefer Me to undress you?

01:39:52.907 --> 01:39:54.780
Why did you insist on Me?

01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:00.322
I remind you of someone.

01:40:04.491 --> 01:40:06.053
Your sister?

01:40:08.972 --> 01:40:10.743
Hardly your daughter.

01:40:12.265 --> 01:40:14.007
My daughters are on the St Luis.

01:40:27.135 --> 01:40:28.594
Sit down

01:40:28.595 --> 01:40:29.845
Please.

01:40:37.243 --> 01:40:38.701
What is your name?

01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:40.578
Dr. Erik Strauss.

01:40:42.767 --> 01:40:44.955
What do you want from me?

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.529
José Estedes thought you might be able to help me.

01:40:50.959 --> 01:40:54.704
You see I worked for over 2 years to bring my children here.

01:40:56.126 --> 01:40:57.785
And I can't get them off that ship.

01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:03.122
What makes think I can help you?

01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:07.956
I don't think. I'm just desperate.

01:41:08.878 --> 01:41:12.291
You see, the chief of Immigration wont see Me and my children have visas.

01:41:13.879 --> 01:41:14.792
It is a pig.

01:41:16.338 --> 01:41:17.499
My only hope...

01:41:20.088 --> 01:41:23.869
The only hope is to appeal to the foreign minister.

01:41:24.964 --> 01:41:28.579
Could you, could ask him to see me please

01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:32.208
But I don't know him.

01:41:46.551 --> 01:41:50.925
I'm sorry tohave taken up your time.

01:41:57.845 --> 01:41:58.586
Doctor.

01:42:02.512 --> 01:42:05.629
I know many other members of the
Government.

01:42:08.013 --> 01:42:09.387
Some very well.

01:42:13.305 --> 01:42:14.763
I can't promise.

01:42:16.473 --> 01:42:19.175
But I'll try to arrange an appointment for you.

01:42:23.057 --> 01:42:24.716
Thank you. Thank you.

01:43:14.982 --> 01:43:16.641
Would you have imagined it, Aaron?

01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:19.566
Having to have patrols to stop us from commiting suicide?

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:23.441
The committee thinks they are needed.

01:43:35.319 --> 01:43:36.314
Again?

01:43:43.403 --> 01:43:45.193
Two days ago you were a journalist.

01:43:46.321 --> 01:43:48.027
- May I go on board now?
- Yes.

01:43:48.238 --> 01:43:49.944
But leave these.

01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:53.483
Nothing is permitted to be taken on board.

01:44:00.448 --> 01:44:03.530
- What newspaper?
- "Der Stuhrmer".

01:44:24.869 --> 01:44:27.357
I was expecting Mr Clasing Why did they send you?

01:44:27.827 --> 01:44:28.822
Is there news?

01:44:29.828 --> 01:44:30.823
None.

01:44:32.328 --> 01:44:36.323
I be perfectly frank: Your passengers are of no interest to me

01:44:37.621 --> 01:44:40.240
I am senior intelligence operative in the Caribbean.

01:44:41.455 --> 01:44:43.695
I report directly
to Admiral Canaris.

01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:45.360
<i>operative?</i>

01:44:45.872 --> 01:44:47.997
Then what connection do you have with the St Luis?

01:44:48.034 --> 01:44:49.028
Why are you here?

01:44:49.831 --> 01:44:52.081
You stopped all shore leave

01:44:52.118 --> 01:44:53.622
while you are anchored in Havana.

01:44:53.873 --> 01:44:54.655
So what?

01:44:54.873 --> 01:44:58.999
Well, you grant shore leave as from today.

01:44:59.036 --> 01:45:01.208
You think you can give me
Orders on board my own ship.

01:45:01.244 --> 01:45:02.213
The orders come from Berlin,

01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:05.414
If you disobey them, be prepared to
except the consequences to yourself

01:45:06.042 --> 01:45:07.286
and your family.

01:45:21.795 --> 01:45:23.951
I take no pleasure in threatening you, captain.

01:45:25.337 --> 01:45:26.616
You are one of us.

01:45:28.671 --> 01:45:30.301
If I tell you we have information

01:45:30.338 --> 01:45:33.834
about a device that can locate
submarines by sound waves,

01:45:34.797 --> 01:45:38.163
vitall  information
that must be got back to Germany,

01:45:40.423 --> 01:45:44.061
I'm sure I can rely upon your sense of honor and duty as a naval officer.

01:45:46.965 --> 01:45:48.922
The first group will go ashore this evening,

01:45:48.958 --> 01:45:50.878
Among them will be the steward Schiendick.

01:45:52.883 --> 01:45:53.878
Good.

01:45:56.133 --> 01:45:58.217
Excuse me, sir, there is a gentleman
from the cuban navy...

01:45:58.254 --> 01:45:59.331
No, not now, Gunter.

01:46:03.968 --> 01:46:05.876
Tell me, what will happen to my passengers?

01:46:07.177 --> 01:46:09.926
I'm only in for the intellegence side of this voyage.

01:46:10.636 --> 01:46:14.049
The propaganda aspects are not my concern.

01:46:14.553 --> 01:46:16.425
Propaganda? What do you mean?

01:46:20.762 --> 01:46:24.627
It was never intended for your passengers to land.

01:46:28.847 --> 01:46:31.846
<i>Big loss, right?</i>

01:46:32.764 --> 01:46:33.962
But can't you see,

01:46:35.432 --> 01:46:39.177
we force the world to realize that there is a problem with these people.

01:46:40.516 --> 01:46:42.306
And if any methods of dealing with them.

01:46:43.391 --> 01:46:45.845
<i>And when we rid
Germany of the problem,</i>

01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:49.882
no one will have the right to object.

01:46:52.268 --> 01:46:54.673
It has been a most useful exercise.

01:46:57.393 --> 01:46:58.472
Good Day Captain.

01:48:32.242 --> 01:48:34.868
<i>I can't tell you how many phone calls I had</i>

01:48:34.904 --> 01:48:37.790
<i>from colleagues and ministers,</i>

01:48:37.827 --> 01:48:39.901
<i>employing Me to aggree to this meeting</i>

01:48:40.535 --> 01:48:44.067
All due, to I believe a friend of yours.

01:48:44.828 --> 01:48:45.941
A young lady

01:48:46.703 --> 01:48:51.278
She seems very mysterious and
I was curious to know excactly what...

01:48:59.205 --> 01:49:00.402
It's sad.

01:49:02.039 --> 01:49:04.907
Your children are important.
Yes of course.

01:49:05.623 --> 01:49:06.618
Forgive Me.

01:49:07.623 --> 01:49:09.164
I'm sorry.

01:49:10.832 --> 01:49:12.029
I didn't mean...

01:49:15.833 --> 01:49:17.326
I just waited so long.

01:49:18.166 --> 01:49:21.782
Everything I had I is gone payed for landing permits, and visas.

01:49:23.667 --> 01:49:25.658
I  lived only to get them to safety.

01:49:27.835 --> 01:49:30.122
Your daughters really have visas?

01:49:30.585 --> 01:49:31.367
Yes.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.331
I got them from the consul of Hamburg.

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:38.576
My wife was to collect them,

01:49:39.253 --> 01:49:41.410
but She thought the landing permits would be enough.

01:49:43.379 --> 01:49:47.076
Do you have sufficiant funds now to support your daughters?

01:49:48.921 --> 01:49:52.122
Only the seven dollars a week I get from the Jewish agency.

01:49:53.464 --> 01:49:55.254
What kind of Doctor are you?

01:49:55.506 --> 01:49:56.584
For the Children.

01:49:57.715 --> 01:50:00.962
I work at the public clinic in Havana five days a week.

01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:03.251
Then you receive a salary.

01:50:03.841 --> 01:50:04.705
Only meals.

01:50:07.466 --> 01:50:09.623
I have no license to practice in Cuba.

01:50:09.925 --> 01:50:11.715
So why do you work there?

01:50:13.509 --> 01:50:14.706
I shall need for me.

01:50:18.385 --> 01:50:21.134
I wanted to repay for beeing allowed to stay in Cuba.

01:50:31.553 --> 01:50:34.089
If it's true that your
daughters have visas,

01:50:36.221 --> 01:50:38.176
But there really is no record of it.

01:50:40.472 --> 01:50:43.180
Mr. Benítez, from Immigration,
refuses to listen to me

01:50:43.217 --> 01:50:45.344
unless I pay him
A thousand dollars for each.

01:50:46.491 --> 01:50:47.741
AHA.

01:50:48.515 --> 01:50:50.030
Benitez

01:51:14.727 --> 01:51:15.889
Doctor Strauss

01:51:17.853 --> 01:51:18.848
Come with me.

01:51:51.733 --> 01:51:54.103
You issue 2 entry Visas at once.

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:56.105
Visas?

01:51:57.026 --> 01:51:57.938
What visas?

01:51:58.359 --> 01:52:01.227
For two the daughters of Dr. Strauss,
on board the St Luis.

01:52:02.693 --> 01:52:05.810
But that is impossible. no one is to be allowed of.

01:52:06.111 --> 01:52:07.667
You do it now.

01:52:11.987 --> 01:52:14.191
But that ship is a gold mine.

01:52:14.612 --> 01:52:18.108
You are allready under investigation, ypu will issue those visas

01:52:18.321 --> 01:52:21.106
or you will be taken at once to El Morro prison.

01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:52.616
It is a pleasure to be of service, senor.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:58.365
Names, ages and place of
Birth of your children, please.

01:53:07.162 --> 01:53:08.157
See you soon.

01:53:09.371 --> 01:53:10.236
See you soon.

01:53:13.121 --> 01:53:13.986
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:53:19.581 --> 01:53:20.494
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:55.910
Don't worry.

01:53:57.254 --> 01:53:59.577
It will work out for everyone.
Don't worry.

01:54:19.716 --> 01:54:21.623
<i>- Yes, it's banned.
- There is.</i>

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.925
- What happened?
- Bad, Milt.

01:54:25.962 --> 01:54:27.204
How bad.

01:54:27.509 --> 01:54:29.717
It says the publicity and the pleas for mercy

01:54:29.754 --> 01:54:32.669
make it impossible for him to reach an objective decision.

01:54:34.135 --> 01:54:36.588
He is Ordering the St. Louis to leave Cuban waters.

01:54:37.219 --> 01:54:38.214
Is foregood?

01:54:39.261 --> 01:54:42.933
No. He said he re-open egotiations

01:54:42.969 --> 01:54:46.501
after she is gone, if We deposit half a million dollars.

01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:50.959
Yes, real cute one.

01:54:53.013 --> 01:54:54.292
What are we going to do?

01:54:55.847 --> 01:54:58.880
We are on the ropes,
but we got a few rounds left.

01:54:59.097 --> 01:55:01.551
You continue it here, I try a few other things.

01:55:03.264 --> 01:55:05.635
First I'll got to see those people on the ship again.

01:55:07.599 --> 01:55:09.222
How I explain this Milt?

01:55:10.766 --> 01:55:12.093
What war zone?

01:55:15.933 --> 01:55:18.285
What is your position, Mr. Troper? Tell us.

01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:20.636
We are making progress.
We keep the pressure up.

01:55:22.018 --> 01:55:23.724
<i>We will not die.</i>

01:55:23.935 --> 01:55:25.676
<i>We must not sail.</i>

01:55:25.768 --> 01:55:27.012
<i>We will not die.</i>

01:55:27.685 --> 01:55:29.316
<i>We must not sail.</i>

01:55:29.352 --> 01:55:31.011
<i>We will not die.</i>

01:55:31.352 --> 01:55:33.390
- We must not sail..
- Please.

01:55:33.519 --> 01:55:34.681
We will not die.

01:55:35.228 --> 01:55:36.686
<i>We must not sail.</i>

01:55:36.853 --> 01:55:38.476
We will not die.

01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:40.763
<i>We must not sail.</i>

01:55:42.146 --> 01:55:43.651
I have been asked to speak to you.

01:55:43.688 --> 01:55:45.560
- When will we land?
- When?

01:55:49.522 --> 01:55:50.303
<i>When?</i>

01:55:52.773 --> 01:55:53.934
Brothers and Sisters.

01:55:56.565 --> 01:55:57.779
Do not give up hope.

01:55:57.815 --> 01:55:59.687
We have visas, why can't we land?

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.268
- Yes!
- We have visas!

01:56:03.358 --> 01:56:06.107
We have the relief agency here in New York,

01:56:07.358 --> 01:56:08.353
Througout the World,

01:56:09.817 --> 01:56:12.934
are working to bring you to safe harbor.

01:56:13.359 --> 01:56:14.733
- Where?
- Where?

01:56:15.193 --> 01:56:17.027
We want to land here in Havana.

01:56:17.063 --> 01:56:18.032
<i>- Yes!
- We have visas!</i>

01:56:18.068 --> 01:56:20.735
The American ambassador is waiting to hear from Franklin Roosevelt

01:56:20.772 --> 01:56:21.657
at any moment.

01:56:21.694 --> 01:56:23.033
Tell them we are responsible people

01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:24.900
- and we don't want charity.
- We have the right to land.

01:56:24.936 --> 01:56:27.980
- We have teachers...
- We have every right to land!

01:56:28.737 --> 01:56:30.527
<i>- You will be saved.
- But when?</i>

01:56:31.529 --> 01:56:32.559
The whole World

01:56:33.946 --> 01:56:34.941
is watching you...

01:56:36.446 --> 01:56:37.441
and praying for you.

01:56:39.238 --> 01:56:40.436
We are one Family.

01:56:44.489 --> 01:56:45.686
You are are my family.

01:56:47.782 --> 01:56:50.899
Throughout the centuries
we have survived because

01:56:53.157 --> 01:56:54.958
We never lost hope.

01:56:59.867 --> 01:57:01.362
May God bless you.

01:57:04.034 --> 01:57:05.316
And watch over you.

01:57:05.326 --> 01:57:07.566
- We need help not prayers.
- What did He say?

01:57:42.916 --> 01:57:43.994
Lunch Time.

01:57:45.249 --> 01:57:46.577
Your not getting dressed?

01:57:49.833 --> 01:57:51.410
It is too hot to eat.

01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:54.536
I think I stay here.

01:57:59.293 --> 01:58:02.624
Those boat people crawling up.

01:58:06.544 --> 01:58:07.539
And this heat.

01:58:11.962 --> 01:58:12.957
¡Egon!

01:58:48.843 --> 01:58:52.209
¡They are leaving us! Stand Back! Stand Back!

01:58:53.677 --> 01:58:54.755
<i>Stand Back!</i>

01:58:55.552 --> 01:58:57.792
<i>Put those guns downs! Put them down!</i>

01:58:58.511 --> 01:59:02.968
<i>Drop those guns down or I'll have my crew throw you of this ship!</i>

01:59:05.054 --> 01:59:07.211
<i>Please try to stay calm.
It will be better for you.</i>

01:59:07.846 --> 01:59:08.592
<i>It is true?</i>

01:59:10.388 --> 01:59:11.466
Are we leaving?

01:59:12.055 --> 01:59:13.852
<i>Please go to the social hall,</i>

01:59:13.889 --> 01:59:15.844
<i>your committee will give you full information there</i>

01:59:57.521 --> 01:59:58.516
Yes.

02:00:06.856 --> 02:00:07.659
Look!

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:11.228
Father.

02:00:11.481 --> 02:00:12.891
Miriam, it's Mira.

02:00:28.401 --> 02:00:30.807
Where did you come from? How did you get here?

02:00:31.485 --> 02:00:33.275
I was expecting you to land,

02:00:33.693 --> 02:00:35.352
I didn't get a pass until today.

02:00:35.569 --> 02:00:38.022
We watched the shores, every boat.

02:00:39.361 --> 02:00:40.129
Daddy.

02:00:42.445 --> 02:00:43.854
I only have three minutes.

02:00:46.737 --> 02:00:47.732
Minutes?

02:00:49.363 --> 02:00:53.688
You look different, not just older, but different.

02:00:55.072 --> 02:00:56.399
Times have changed, dad.

02:00:56.614 --> 02:00:58.735
You wear expensive clothes.

02:00:59.531 --> 02:01:00.396
Makeup?

02:01:03.282 --> 02:01:05.574
- What have you done to your eyes?
- It doesn't matter.

02:01:05.610 --> 02:01:07.695
I just wanted to see you, know how you are.

02:01:08.113 --> 02:01:09.154
What is this?

02:01:12.594 --> 02:01:14.365
And what is this?

02:01:14.574 --> 02:01:16.137
Why are you wearing them?

02:01:17.284 --> 02:01:19.159
It does not mean anything.

02:01:19.681 --> 02:01:21.244
So why are you wearing it?

02:01:21.662 --> 02:01:23.016
Help me.

02:01:31.456 --> 02:01:32.915
Here.

02:01:36.249 --> 02:01:38.021
Take this. Hide it quickly.

02:01:38.543 --> 02:01:40.730
$ 1,300, it's for you.

02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:42.919
Where did you get it?

02:01:44.379 --> 02:01:47.192
I have many friends
Here, they helped me.

02:01:47.714 --> 02:01:51.152
I was trying to buy visas for you , but the price kept rising.

02:01:52.248 --> 02:01:55.579
I don't understand how you have so much money.

02:01:58.624 --> 02:01:59.738
How did you get it?

02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:03.040
- It's mine. I earned it.
- How?

02:02:04.333 --> 02:02:06.904
- How?
- Miriam, please.

02:02:07.959 --> 02:02:11.491
I earned it for you. To help them.

02:02:12.293 --> 02:02:13.951
And keep it, for God's sake.

02:02:15.585 --> 02:02:19.366
You get a pass when no one else can

02:02:19.836 --> 02:02:21.115
you come here made up looking like...

02:02:22.545 --> 02:02:24.370
There is so little time, We are wasting it.

02:02:25.170 --> 02:02:26.414
- No.
- No!

02:02:27.712 --> 02:02:28.454
Miriam!

02:02:31.463 --> 02:02:32.493
It is our daughter.

02:02:36.422 --> 02:02:39.669
For everything thats happened,

02:02:42.798 --> 02:02:44.077
There is a reason.

02:02:47.590 --> 02:02:49.546
No questions.

02:02:53.925 --> 02:02:55.548
Thank you. Thank you.

02:03:00.801 --> 02:03:04.712
- Maybe this cross, helps people to accept it.
- Yes.

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:06.171
It has been helping.

02:03:12.344 --> 02:03:13.126
I love you

02:03:14.095 --> 02:03:16.169
My love for you has not changed.

02:03:18.054 --> 02:03:20.543
I wait for the day we can be together again.

02:03:22.304 --> 02:03:24.011
I have to go. I have to go.

02:03:32.098 --> 02:03:33.176
Goodbye.

02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:36.464
No.

02:03:36.807 --> 02:03:38.679
No,Mira. Mira!

02:03:39.432 --> 02:03:40.676
May God go with you.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.674
I had so many things I wanted to say.

02:03:51.684 --> 02:03:53.722
I don't even know where she lives.

02:04:14.605 --> 02:04:15.848
Small Boat clear, sir.

02:04:17.813 --> 02:04:18.808
Good.

02:04:19.730 --> 02:04:20.761
Way anchors.

02:05:32.409 --> 02:05:34.779
What are the figures, Mr. Mueller?

02:05:36.034 --> 02:05:40.242
Well at present level Sir we have enough food and water for ten or eleven days.

02:05:40.577 --> 02:05:41.774
More if we introduce rationing.

02:05:43.952 --> 02:05:44.782
Mr. Ostenmeyer?

02:05:45.078 --> 02:05:46.654
Our Fuel is the problem, sir.

02:05:47.161 --> 02:05:49.662
We still have enough to get back
to any port in Europe,

02:05:49.698 --> 02:05:51.866
but only if the decision is made whitin twenty four hours.

02:05:52.204 --> 02:05:55.901
Sir, a fishy looking craft  approaching on the Port bow.

02:06:02.997 --> 02:06:04.538
US coast guard cutter.

02:06:04.789 --> 02:06:07.195
She is signaling standby to receive message?

02:06:24.251 --> 02:06:25.708
Mrs. Weiler, is it possible?

02:06:27.418 --> 02:06:28.532
It's possible.

02:06:41.003 --> 02:06:42.034
<i>Message ends.</i>

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:43.415
Read it to me.

02:06:46.421 --> 02:06:48.661
"Attention, captain St Luis."

02:06:50.047 --> 02:06:52.749
You are violating US territorial imits

02:06:53.297 --> 02:06:56.296
Do not approch any closer. Do not attempt to land.

02:06:56.964 --> 02:06:58.220
You will not, repeat not,

02:06:58.256 --> 02:07:01.705
be permitted to dock at any United States Port.

02:07:02.257 --> 02:07:03.252
"Acknowledge "

02:07:05.966 --> 02:07:09.581
Signal: "Message received, and Acknowledged".

02:07:19.468 --> 02:07:22.087
- Heading: East Northeast.
- East Northeast, sir.

02:07:25.011 --> 02:07:26.385

02:07:26.761 --> 02:07:28.503
Yes sir. what Destination?

02:07:53.682 --> 02:07:55.092

02:07:55.307 --> 02:07:57.796
Mr. Pozner, may I have a word with you for a minute please?

02:07:59.308 --> 02:08:00.587
- Yes, come in.
- Thank you.

02:08:12.435 --> 02:08:14.758
I shouldn't realy, bee here telling you this.

02:08:17.853 --> 02:08:20.721
Everbody thinks we are on our way back to Cuba.

02:08:22.312 --> 02:08:23.342
Well, they are not.

02:08:26.187 --> 02:08:28.143
We are going back to Hamburg.

02:08:30.896 --> 02:08:33.480
I can't believe it,the captain would have made an announcement.

02:08:33.517 --> 02:08:34.677
Yes, he is going to.

02:08:34.897 --> 02:08:36.059
He is going to make an announcement,

02:08:37.939 --> 02:08:39.977
but not until we are a day on course.

02:08:57.026 --> 02:08:59.693
And why are you telling me this, Max?

02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:01.855
Why?

02:09:04.527 --> 02:09:08.023
Because I thought you ought to know.

02:09:09.403 --> 02:09:10.481
I didn't  know. I...

02:09:11.945 --> 02:09:12.975
I'm sorry.

02:09:14.278 --> 02:09:15.273
Excuse me.

02:09:18.946 --> 02:09:20.060
Mr. Pozner.

02:09:23.405 --> 02:09:24.898
Can I ask you something?

02:09:26.739 --> 02:09:27.734
Please.

02:09:30.614 --> 02:09:33.981
What is it like to be a Jew in Germany?

02:09:35.365 --> 02:09:38.980
It's something that you are constant beeing reminded off.

02:09:40.158 --> 02:09:41.106
Beeing Jewish.

02:09:44.492 --> 02:09:45.487
Max!

02:09:46.784 --> 02:09:47.779
<i>Shalom.</i>

02:10:31.083 --> 02:10:31.829
Did you tell him?

02:10:33.875 --> 02:10:34.870
Yes.

02:10:36.959 --> 02:10:38.072
What are you going to do?

02:10:40.293 --> 02:10:41.287
I do not know.

02:10:47.710 --> 02:10:49.417
Nothing anyone can do.

02:10:57.087 --> 02:10:58.912
The only way of this ship...

02:11:01.838 --> 02:11:03.544
Is the way my father chose.

02:11:04.296 --> 02:11:06.719
No, please, please.

02:11:06.755 --> 02:11:08.297
- It’s true.
- Please do not say that.

02:11:08.334 --> 02:11:10.418
Cant you see.

02:11:13.673 --> 02:11:15.214
He is the one that got away.

02:11:23.591 --> 02:11:24.520
Hold me.

02:11:27.092 --> 02:11:28.419
I'm so afraid.

02:11:33.885 --> 02:11:34.998
I am not strong.

02:11:35.218 --> 02:11:37.458
I'm not as brave as  my father.

02:11:41.386 --> 02:11:43.092
I'm afraid of these camps.

02:11:43.803 --> 02:11:45.344
The things they do there.

02:11:50.637 --> 02:11:51.632
I dont know.

02:11:56.597 --> 02:11:57.758
I don't realy know...

02:11:58.722 --> 02:12:00.464
what it is to be a woman.

02:12:05.598 --> 02:12:06.676
Promise me...

02:12:10.057 --> 02:12:12.095
Promise me I won't go to one of these camps.

02:12:12.516 --> 02:12:13.511
Promise

02:12:14.016 --> 02:12:15.426
I promise. I promise.

02:12:25.226 --> 02:12:26.221
You know that?

02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:29.055
Proost.

02:12:29.394 --> 02:12:30.389
Proost.

02:12:30.686 --> 02:12:33.767
I tell you what.
You are all on my list.

02:14:18.328 --> 02:14:20.200
We are going to search this cabin.

02:14:22.787 --> 02:14:23.782
Why?

02:14:27.913 --> 02:14:31.030
I have authority to check on trouble makers like you.

02:14:31.705 --> 02:14:32.985
You can't touch that.

02:15:11.628 --> 02:15:13.952
Its time you have your head shaved again.

02:15:21.422 --> 02:15:22.417
Gunter

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:39.878
Gunter

02:15:57.428 --> 02:15:58.423
Gunter

02:15:59.803 --> 02:16:00.798
Open up

02:16:14.639 --> 02:16:15.463
Max.

02:16:32.308 --> 02:16:33.303
God.

02:16:37.888 --> 02:16:39.347
God!

02:16:53.414 --> 02:16:54.977
Still here, Mr. Troper?

02:16:54.977 --> 02:16:56.124
I said I said word.

02:16:56.125 --> 02:16:58.416
Yes, but I thought something might be decided.

02:16:58.418 --> 02:17:02.584
Hardly likely today, the Prime Minister has other things to think about to you know.

02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:05.398
I realize that.

02:17:05.816 --> 02:17:10.504
I can only repeat King Leopold was touched by your plead.

02:17:10.505 --> 02:17:14.257
And he has spoken with Queen Wilhelmina of Holland and with the President of France.

02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:17.071
But they have aggreed nothing definite as yet.

02:17:18.010 --> 02:17:20.302
I'm sure you are much more comfortable in your Hotel.

02:17:20.303 --> 02:17:21.969
No, I will wait here.

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:25.930
Well, if you insist. At least
Let me order you some Tea or Coffee.

02:17:25.931 --> 02:17:26.972
No thank you.

02:17:27.911 --> 02:17:31.141
You do realize that this is not
A matter of a few hours.

02:17:31.663 --> 02:17:36.768
No answer will be expected for some time, So you must remain calm, Mr. Troper.

02:17:37.394 --> 02:17:38.957
I am.

02:17:39.165 --> 02:17:42.082
I'm calm. I am always been calm.

02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:44.688
I was calm in New York, I was calm in Cuba.

02:17:44.689 --> 02:17:48.022
I was calm in London I was calm in
Paris. I am very calm.

02:17:48.023 --> 02:17:49.691
I understand your concern, Mr. Troper

02:17:49.691 --> 02:17:52.609
but there comes a time You must trust someone.

02:17:55.527 --> 02:17:57.818
You are right, forgive me.

02:17:59.696 --> 02:18:01.361
See...

02:18:02.822 --> 02:18:04.489
I'm running out of people.

02:18:06.156 --> 02:18:08.136
You are the end of the line.

02:18:34.452 --> 02:18:35.448
Excuse me.

02:18:36.745 --> 02:18:37.740
Madam.

02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:40.834
Isn't that Ana Rosens dress?

02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:43.704
Mrs. Rosen asked for it to be cleaned immediately.

02:18:47.246 --> 02:18:48.242
Where is she?

02:18:48.456 --> 02:18:51.123
She hasn't left her cabin for the last 2 days.

02:18:54.165 --> 02:18:55.361
- Give it to me.
- But...

02:18:55.957 --> 02:18:57.550
I'll take care.

02:19:19.606 --> 02:19:20.596
Mrs. Rosen

02:19:29.191 --> 02:19:31.727
Mrs. Rosen, It's Denise
Kreisler may I come in?

02:19:54.279 --> 02:19:55.393
O my god!

02:20:01.947 --> 02:20:04.400
Oh, Oh yes that's good.

02:20:05.114 --> 02:20:06.393
Have they removed the stain?

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:11.311
I made it for Ana She wore it to the ball.

02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:14.735
I know.

02:20:15.407 --> 02:20:16.817
I did everything for her.

02:20:17.449 --> 02:20:18.279
I tried.

02:20:18.991 --> 02:20:20.947
I Really tried, but she's gone.

02:20:21.492 --> 02:20:25.403
She's  gone. I was not there
when she needed me.

02:20:27.784 --> 02:20:30.948
She was so delicate that I
I'm so worried that she's cold.

02:20:31.452 --> 02:20:34.869
Mrs. Rosen, please.
Get up Come with me.

02:20:34.905 --> 02:20:36.041
- What are you doing?
- Come with me.

02:20:36.077 --> 02:20:37.953
-We are going out of here.
- What is he doing here?

02:20:37.989 --> 02:20:38.782
Let's go we are leaving.

02:20:38.994 --> 02:20:40.367
Get out. Go away from me.

02:20:40.403 --> 02:20:41.740
- Mrs. Rosen.
- Leave me alone.

02:20:42.662 --> 02:20:45.912
Your husband is alive. He is in a hospital in Cuba.

02:20:45.949 --> 02:20:46.943
He will get well again.

02:20:47.204 --> 02:20:50.121
He will need you when He gets out, What you're doing is wrong.

02:20:50.158 --> 02:20:51.863
You don't understand, I have to be punished,

02:20:52.663 --> 02:20:54.654
I was wrong. I failed him.

02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.202
Now I want God to see that I'm sorry.

02:20:57.414 --> 02:20:59.239
I really am sorry, please.

02:20:59.623 --> 02:21:02.325
Please, you must give her back to me.

02:21:05.082 --> 02:21:06.077
Listen to me.

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:09.622
Ana is dead. She is dead, can you hear me?

02:21:09.791 --> 02:21:12.743
But you are alive.
Your husband will need you.

02:21:13.167 --> 02:21:13.964
No!

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.917
What will he say when you're not there?

02:21:15.954 --> 02:21:17.244
No! No!

02:21:18.209 --> 02:21:21.789
No, don't talk to me anymore,
I have things to do.

02:21:22.543 --> 02:21:24.369
There are things I have to do.

02:21:24.919 --> 02:21:26.328
Allright. Allright.

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.250
Give me the scissors. I'll help you.

02:21:30.211 --> 02:21:31.538
Do you want to humiliate yourself?

02:21:31.961 --> 02:21:34.913
Do you want to punish yourself?
Is that what you want?

02:21:35.129 --> 02:21:36.326
Say, is that what you want?

02:21:36.546 --> 02:21:38.999
There.

02:21:39.754 --> 02:21:40.749
Look at yourself

02:22:16.844 --> 02:22:17.839
I know.

02:22:21.553 --> 02:22:22.750
I know.

02:22:26.595 --> 02:22:29.428
Two worthless fools
Without the curage to face life.

02:22:29.721 --> 02:22:30.716
Did you know them

02:22:31.346 --> 02:22:32.508
Did you know how they felt?

02:22:33.013 --> 02:22:34.387
You understand them.

02:22:35.138 --> 02:22:37.544
You understand giving in.
You understand fear.

02:22:40.348 --> 02:22:41.757
I despise them.

02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:44.467
I despise them.

02:22:44.682 --> 02:22:45.677
- Denise.
- No!

02:22:46.432 --> 02:22:48.755
You make me feel
Guilty because I want to live.

02:22:49.182 --> 02:22:52.134
Being with you, not like them,
They threw there lifes away.

02:22:52.850 --> 02:22:54.558
But you have to feel something for these Eleen.

02:22:54.595 --> 02:22:55.506
Yes, I pity them.

02:22:56.767 --> 02:22:59.469
They died like poor
children afraid of the dark.

02:22:59.809 --> 02:23:01.006
That is what we all become!

02:23:02.435 --> 02:23:03.429
Denise!

02:23:07.602 --> 02:23:08.846
I will not accept it.

02:23:12.811 --> 02:23:14.055
I will not accept it.

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.015
I want...

02:23:19.396 --> 02:23:21.221
I want the man I married.

02:23:25.188 --> 02:23:26.847
You used to be so arrogant.

02:23:28.897 --> 02:23:30.059
So sure of yourself.

02:23:30.481 --> 02:23:33.104
Now you have become weak, uncertain.

02:23:33.105 --> 02:23:35.312
At least, I stopped pretending.

02:23:37.774 --> 02:23:40.263
- Why are you giving in?
- Do you know whats going to happen to us?

02:23:41.358 --> 02:23:43.265
Over this ship people are making plans.

02:23:44.066 --> 02:23:45.808
Trying to find some way out.

02:23:46.942 --> 02:23:48.849
- But, you just...
- You realize

02:23:51.151 --> 02:23:53.355
in two days time, when we land,

02:23:54.485 --> 02:23:55.942
The Gestapo will be waiting for us.

02:24:02.903 --> 02:24:03.898
Look.

02:24:04.486 --> 02:24:05.481
Look at this.

02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:08.610
This is how it will end for all of us.

02:24:11.154 --> 02:24:12.695
We have no more time.

02:24:16.197 --> 02:24:17.644
Go to the captain.

02:24:18.905 --> 02:24:20.655
Make him do something.

02:24:46.410 --> 02:24:47.665
What is our position?

02:24:47.702 --> 02:24:50.617
About two hunderd and 30 miles West southwest of Landsend.

02:24:50.952 --> 02:24:52.362
On the south coast of England.

02:25:04.663 --> 02:25:05.777
Take them out!

02:25:12.539 --> 02:25:13.320
The radio room!

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:16.081
Captain we want the ship!

02:25:16.118 --> 02:25:17.325
You have no chance!

02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.415
You need to control the engineroom as well

02:25:19.452 --> 02:25:20.796
and every man on the crew.

02:25:20.832 --> 02:25:22.740
We have you and your officers.

02:25:23.291 --> 02:25:24.880
You are our hostages!

02:25:24.916 --> 02:25:26.708
- For what?
- To save our lifes.

02:25:26.745 --> 02:25:28.089
To save everyones Life.

02:25:28.125 --> 02:25:31.040
Now you will set course to any place except Germany.

02:25:31.292 --> 02:25:32.702
No matter what you do,

02:25:33.501 --> 02:25:35.906
I will not give order to move my ship of its course

02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:37.626
without that orderyou can do nothing.

02:25:39.627 --> 02:25:41.499
He's the helmsman, for God sake, let him go.

02:25:41.711 --> 02:25:43.702
Don't anybody try to fight

02:25:44.336 --> 02:25:45.533
and you will not get hurt.

02:25:47.003 --> 02:25:49.160
We simpatise with you
Every man here.

02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:51.460
But what you are doing now is mutiny.

02:25:51.879 --> 02:25:52.874
Allright.

02:25:53.087 --> 02:25:54.843
If you put down your weapons and leave,

02:25:54.879 --> 02:25:57.001
I promise no action shall be taken against any man.

02:25:58.047 --> 02:25:58.982
No!

02:25:59.005 --> 02:26:00.000
What's going here?

02:26:00.672 --> 02:26:01.750
Are you crazy?

02:26:02.172 --> 02:26:04.798
- Release him.
- If you are not with us, get out of here.

02:26:04.834 --> 02:26:07.369
And consent to continue
With this stupidity.

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.630
Get Out! Get of this bridge!

02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:12.413
You cannot continue with your stupidity!

02:26:13.091 --> 02:26:16.008
You are alone! No other passenger will join you.

02:26:16.044 --> 02:26:17.465
We dont need anymore.

02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:19.014
Fine! Get out!

02:26:19.050 --> 02:26:22.084
Yes, and than the crew will storm the bridge and you all are finished.

02:26:22.342 --> 02:26:25.181
For god sake, tomorrow
we will reach the English coast,

02:26:25.218 --> 02:26:28.465
then we will turn into the Channel, its only one day sail to Hamburg.

02:26:28.968 --> 02:26:32.381
Captain, very man that was released from the camps,

02:26:32.636 --> 02:26:35.111
was given fourteen days
to leave Germany

02:26:35.147 --> 02:26:37.587
and told if they returned they would be executed.

02:26:38.011 --> 02:26:39.552
We will not go back.

02:26:39.803 --> 02:26:42.209
I will do everything in my
power to prevent that.

02:26:42.846 --> 02:26:44.303
I give you my solom word.

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:48.842
Your word as a German officer!

02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:50.461
As Christian

02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:53.086
It was the Christians that built the camps.

02:26:53.931 --> 02:26:56.550
It was the Christians starving and killing us.

02:26:57.431 --> 02:26:59.967
- Your word as Christian.
- No!

02:27:01.515 --> 02:27:02.712
His word as a man.

02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:05.221
Do you know what this
man did for us?

02:27:05.683 --> 02:27:08.141
He tried to get permission for us to land

02:27:08.178 --> 02:27:09.136
From the Cuban president.

02:27:10.767 --> 02:27:12.557
From our own ambassador in Havana.

02:27:13.601 --> 02:27:15.058
And do you know what He risked?

02:27:15.601 --> 02:27:16.975
To his children, his family.

02:27:17.268 --> 02:27:20.716
And what guarantees do we have that
that He still doesn't land us in Hamburg?

02:27:21.185 --> 02:27:22.429
We have him as a guarantee.

02:27:24.311 --> 02:27:26.218
Do you know how to run a ship?

02:27:28.395 --> 02:27:30.018
If you take over, we all are lost.

02:28:01.108 --> 02:28:02.001
Captain.

02:28:17.236 --> 02:28:18.065
Aaron

02:28:23.529 --> 02:28:24.642
Take the wheel, Koster.

02:28:25.404 --> 02:28:27.940
- Maintain present course.
- Yes, sir, present course.

02:28:37.864 --> 02:28:39.274
This incident is over.

02:28:41.407 --> 02:28:42.900
We will all forget it.

02:28:53.992 --> 02:28:55.900
Thank you Professor. I am very grateful.

02:29:07.452 --> 02:29:09.139
I want to show you something.

02:29:10.536 --> 02:29:12.243
This was slipped under my door

02:29:12.828 --> 02:29:14.487
just after we left Havana.

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:17.994
It is signed by two hundred of your fellow passengers.

02:29:18.579 --> 02:29:21.955
They all sworn that rather then be taken back to Hamburg,

02:29:21.991 --> 02:29:24.029
they link arms and jump into the sea.

02:29:25.122 --> 02:29:27.044
We are desperate people, captain.

02:29:27.081 --> 02:29:29.164
I never doubted the
Sincerity of that.

02:29:29.201 --> 02:29:31.079
You must do something immediately.

02:29:31.998 --> 02:29:35.080
Otherwise we bring an empty ship into Hamburg.

02:29:37.582 --> 02:29:42.075
Professor. Tomorrow we shall be of the coast of  Sussex in England.

02:29:42.708 --> 02:29:47.248
There is a reef of conseeled rocks,a quarter of a mile from shore,

02:29:47.459 --> 02:29:49.699
thats about where we are supposed to enter the Channel

02:29:51.210 --> 02:29:53.745
I intend to run my ship onto that reef,

02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:58.290
set her on fire and evacuate my passengers ashore.

02:29:59.169 --> 02:30:03.958
However, it has to look like an authentic shipbreak.

02:30:05.462 --> 02:30:09.077
Do you realize what would happen to us if there is any suspicion at al?

02:30:11.463 --> 02:30:12.458
Do it.

02:30:14.255 --> 02:30:15.962
Don't tell anyone, just do it.

02:30:18.255 --> 02:30:20.234
Still no news for you I'm affraid.

02:30:23.361 --> 02:30:25.132
I've been here for two days.

02:30:25.133 --> 02:30:26.591
Well, I did warn you.

02:30:28.468 --> 02:30:30.343
I'm sorry, Mr. Troper.

02:30:32.532 --> 02:30:33.782
I must go back in.
