WEBVTT

00:04.571 --> 00:06.171
REBECCA:
<i>Mayday, Mayday!</i>

00:06.206 --> 00:08.473
<i>This is the sailing vessel</i>
Mokulaii,

00:08.508 --> 00:10.108
<i>out of Honolulu.</i>

00:10.143 --> 00:12.077
<i>We have suffered reef damage,</i>

00:12.112 --> 00:13.111
taking on water.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.280
I repeat:
we are taking on water.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.748
Mayday, Mayday!

00:16.783 --> 00:19.051
This is the<i> Mokulaii</i>
out of Honolulu.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.085
Can anyone hear us?

00:21.154 --> 00:23.755
Mayday, Mayday!

00:23.790 --> 00:28.160
Hey! I see a... a Maritime
Patrol Cutter... up ahead!

00:28.195 --> 00:29.127
(laughs)

00:29.162 --> 00:31.730
I think I can get to it!

00:31.765 --> 00:33.399
The lights!

00:50.517 --> 00:53.518
Come on! A little more.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.220
Oh, my God.
Here we go. Here we go.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.224
CHARLES:
Hello?

01:04.631 --> 01:06.298
Anybody on board?

01:09.436 --> 01:11.436
CHARLES:
Hello?

01:11.471 --> 01:12.504
Hello?

01:12.539 --> 01:14.073
Anybody?

01:15.809 --> 01:18.143
Hello?

01:18.178 --> 01:19.678
Hello?

01:26.553 --> 01:27.786
I don't understand.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.154
Where is everyone?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.126
CHARLES:
Keep looking.

01:34.161 --> 01:35.694
(grunts)

01:35.729 --> 01:37.896
Hello?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.332
Anybody on board?

01:54.314 --> 01:55.914
Oh, my God.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.250
They're all dead.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.689
<i>(Hawaii Five-O</i>
theme song plays)

02:32.419 --> 02:35.554
STEVE: Stop. Would you be doing
this if Charlie was here?

02:35.589 --> 02:36.788
No.
- No.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.191
Because that would be
setting a bad example.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.725
Now...

02:40.760 --> 02:45.230
if you would please...
do me this one favor.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.266
No, I will not bend over
and cough, with your cold hands.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.968
It's not that kind of test.
Just look that way.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.203
It's something
I've always wanted to do.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.671
Could you do me a favor, please?

02:52.706 --> 02:53.738
(sighs)

02:53.773 --> 02:55.507
Thank you.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.680
Wait a minute.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.315
Oh, funny.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.816
Nothing.
- Nothing in there.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.451
(German accent): There's
nothing inside. Nothing?

03:06.486 --> 03:09.287
Nothing. No, no, come here,
come here, let me do it.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.989
Easy, easy. It's...

03:11.024 --> 03:12.857
What do you mean?
Be-- It's delicate in there.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.392
I know.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.660
I don't know
why, but...

03:15.695 --> 03:16.995
There it is.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.630
There's the brain
on Steve McGarrett.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.498
Yeah, you see it?
Looks like a pea or, like,

03:20.533 --> 03:21.466
a little bean.
You're an idiot.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.568
Get off, off. KOHASHI:
Commander McGarrett.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.904
I couldn't get a sitter
for my kid, I'm sorry.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.305
I had to bring him along.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.473
Detective Danny Williams.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.309
Hey, uh, why don't you
wait out there

03:31.344 --> 03:33.278
so the adults can talk
a little bit?

03:33.313 --> 03:34.613
Actually, this is gonna
be pretty quick.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.314
Gonna be pretty quick, so.
According to your tests,

03:36.349 --> 03:38.350
you... everything looks good.
STEVE: Hey.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.353
Your post-op recovery is
a little slower than I expected,

03:41.388 --> 03:43.655
but your new liver
is doing well.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.590
Well, that's great news, right?

03:45.625 --> 03:48.026
Any, um, signs of
radiation poisoning?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.928
Radia... radiation?

03:49.963 --> 03:51.696
Is he kidding?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.865
Did he bring that up?
Why would you bring that up?

03:53.900 --> 03:57.502
Well, I'll tell him. We, um...
we were exposed to uranium,

03:57.537 --> 03:58.970
uh, a few weeks ago,
and we had to

03:59.005 --> 03:59.938
defuse a dirty bomb,

03:59.973 --> 04:02.340
which was gonna take out
half the population,

04:02.375 --> 04:04.509
so we were doing
a good thing, but anyway,

04:04.544 --> 04:05.944
he strapped on a, um,

04:05.979 --> 04:07.012
a car battery to protect
his vitals.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.047
So, if nothing came up,
nothing came up. Stupid.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.583
I just wanted to make sure.
Now that we know we're good...

04:11.618 --> 04:13.585
Okay, is that it?

04:13.620 --> 04:16.488
Yeah. Just keep taking
your anti-rejection medication,

04:16.523 --> 04:18.323
and I would say you could

04:18.358 --> 04:20.592
slowly start to resume
normal physical activity.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.429
Uh, just... when you say
"normal physical activity,"

04:24.464 --> 04:25.764
you mean, uh...
What do you mean?

04:25.799 --> 04:26.898
A little cardio,

04:26.933 --> 04:28.900
some light weight training.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.336
Light weight training.
So, uh, hand-to-hand combat

04:31.371 --> 04:32.604
or parkour, jumping
out of airplanes,

04:32.639 --> 04:33.605
that's-that's out.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.806
Absolutely.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.074
DANNY: Ah. So you know. Okay.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.075
That's good to know.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.311
(laughs)

04:39.346 --> 04:40.445
What's so funny?

04:40.480 --> 04:41.713
Nothing, nothing.
(phone rings)

04:41.748 --> 04:43.348
Uh, excuse me for one second.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.716
McGarrett.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.055
What you doing?

04:50.090 --> 04:52.424
Milking a cow. What does it
look like I'm doing?

04:52.459 --> 04:53.858
Ha. (chuckles)

04:53.893 --> 04:56.328
Yeah, I remember when I was
young and sarcastic.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.562
Those were the good old days.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.765
See, back then, your grandfather
would've rewarded my sarcasm

05:00.800 --> 05:02.701
with a couple of loose teeth.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.070
You, on the other hand,
won't be seeing any parts

05:05.105 --> 05:09.074
of a driver's license unless
you change your misguided ways.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.442
Sorry, I'm packing.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.611
That's what you told me
to do, right?

05:13.646 --> 05:17.482
That's more like it,
and yes, I did tell you to pack.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.718
For the weekend,
not for the month.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.520
Son, the key to travel

05:22.555 --> 05:24.356
is keeping it light.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.091
We do not want
to be waiting around

05:26.126 --> 05:28.493
for some underpaid
O'Hare baggage handler

05:28.528 --> 05:31.396
to take our bags from the plane.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.631
Trust your old man when
it comes to these things.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.802
What you really want in travel
is total control,

05:37.837 --> 05:40.538
and that is where
the carry-on comes in.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.907
See, then it's
just grab and go

05:42.942 --> 05:46.945
from the time the plane
connects with the jetway.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.548
When you overpack, all you do
is kill the vibe of the vacay

05:50.583 --> 05:51.916
right from the beginning.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.986
Dad, you're not gonna use words
like "vacay," are you?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.489
"Hey, hey, hey, Dad,
c-can I borrow the car?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.391
I want to take Grace
to the movies."

05:59.426 --> 06:01.025
"I'm afraid not, son.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.562
You see, you don't have
a driver's license."

06:04.597 --> 06:06.698
"Oh, yeah, I remember, I was
talking all smart and stuff

06:06.733 --> 06:09.100
when I was supposed to be
packing for Chicago."

06:09.135 --> 06:10.502
Vacay it is.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.636
All right.
(claps hands)

06:11.671 --> 06:13.571
Now that we got
the ground rules set,

06:13.606 --> 06:16.040
let's get this boys' trip
on the road, all right?

06:16.075 --> 06:19.043
Oh, and one more thing.

06:19.078 --> 06:22.547
Please do not be texting Grace
every five minutes.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.149
Okay? This is
man time.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.418
Bonding time.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.585
Hmm?

06:27.620 --> 06:29.754
What-what about
when you're in court?

06:29.789 --> 06:32.090
That's only gonna be
for a couple of hour-- son.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.458
Come on, man.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.592
Be cool.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.127
As fine as
your mother is,

06:36.162 --> 06:38.029
you think I'm on the phone
with her every five minutes?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.432
And I got people out here
shooting at me.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.834
You can wait for three days
to text little Miss Grace.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.068
It's three days.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.970
You'll live.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.539
Now finish packing;
your mother's taking us

06:47.574 --> 06:49.708
to the airport
in ten minutes, now.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.511
All right,
what you are looking at here

06:53.546 --> 06:55.180
is an HMP Cutter
out of Maui.

06:55.215 --> 06:58.516
Lost contact 36 hours ago,
and then, early this morning,

06:58.551 --> 07:00.552
shows up on our
North Shore.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.087
It was discovered by a couple
requesting an S.O.S.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.957
They boarded the vessel,
discovered the whole crew dead.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.759
Now, last transmission

07:07.794 --> 07:10.862
reported a commercial
fishing trawler

07:10.897 --> 07:12.230
out of Japan,
entering U.S. waters.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.599
Little far from home.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.734
Right, now when the trawler
didn't respond to radio contact,

07:16.769 --> 07:18.036
the Cutter engaged.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.604
We're thinking
they were surprised

07:19.639 --> 07:21.506
and overpowered,
'cause they killed everybody.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.775
Suggests to me they couldn't
afford any witnesses.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.210
Sounds like organized crime.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.979
JERRY: You're exactly right.
Ballistics already matched slugs

07:28.014 --> 07:30.615
pulled from the boat
to a Yakuza family.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.554
DANNY:
Michelle Shioma?

07:36.589 --> 07:37.555
Wasn't she on the run?

07:37.590 --> 07:38.556
Apparently not.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.657
JERRY:
I was able to pull

07:39.692 --> 07:40.725
satellite surveillance
from the area

07:40.760 --> 07:43.261
surrounding the crime scene,
and managed to track

07:43.296 --> 07:44.696
that suspicious trawler

07:44.731 --> 07:47.098
to a spot five miles
south of Polihua Beach

07:47.133 --> 07:48.700
on Lanai.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.702
STEVE: This place is
supposed to be abandoned.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.538
Only, it shows activity.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.206
Okay. If Michelle Shioma
is involved,

07:55.241 --> 07:57.675
she's back in business
and running her drug operation

07:57.710 --> 07:59.578
right under our noses.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.714
Not anymore.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.700
All right, guys,
I'm gonna put it down at, uh...

08:22.735 --> 08:25.803
four klicks from the location
we saw on the satellite image.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.539
We'll hike the rest of the way.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.140
You know, no one
can understand you

08:29.175 --> 08:31.843
when you say stupid
things like "klicks."

08:31.878 --> 08:34.913
Danny, "klick"
stands for kilometer.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.749
Each one is 0.62 miles.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.751
All right. Teacher's
pets, the both of you.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.087
Nobody likes
teacher's pets.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.798
Look at this, look at this.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.801
The trawler is exactly
where Jerry said it would be.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.314
Jerry. You there?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.182
JERRY:
Roger that, Commander.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.984
Special Consultant Ortega,
aka your eye in the sky

09:13.019 --> 09:13.985
is on the line.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.286
STEVE:
All right, listen.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.287
Jungle canopy's pretty thick.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.889
You may lose us at some point.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.324
Copy that. STEVE: Keep
an eye on that trawler.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.759
If it moves, I want to know
about it, all right?

09:21.794 --> 09:24.028
You got it.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.998
♪ Chi city, yeah ♪

09:27.033 --> 09:29.334
♪ Chi city ♪
♪ I'm comin' home again ♪

09:29.369 --> 09:31.369
♪ Do you think about me now and then?

09:31.404 --> 09:34.105
GROVER:
<i>See that? What I tell you?</i>

09:34.140 --> 09:37.775
45 minutes from O'Hare Airport
to the Hilton hotel.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.877
Now, if we had big luggage,

09:39.912 --> 09:42.614
we'd still be at the airport
right now, waiting on it.

09:42.649 --> 09:43.948
And...

09:43.983 --> 09:45.883
not carrying
any heavy bags means

09:45.918 --> 09:48.920
I don't have to go broke
tipping people.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.355
So that's another
helpful travel hint

09:50.390 --> 09:53.024
from your old man.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.126
Dad, can we get
some room service? I'm starving.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.362
Room serv... What you want
to order room service for?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.796
Room service is for tourists.

09:58.831 --> 09:59.930
Look.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.934
In a few minutes, we're gonna
go down to Georgie's,

10:02.969 --> 10:05.403
have us some deep dish, then
we gonna go over to Ferrara's,

10:05.438 --> 10:06.738
have a little cannoli...

10:06.773 --> 10:07.939
Look, Dad.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.341
Mom made me promise not to
let you go crazy with the eats.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.011
Boy, I hope I'm there the day
you<i> let me</i> do something.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.312
I let you into this world.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.047
Let me tell you something,
I made you.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.949
I'll make another one
look just like you.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.183
Won't nobody even know
you was missing.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.919
So, remember,

10:21.954 --> 10:25.023
what happens in Chicago
stays in Chicago.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.924
So you want me to lie to Mom?

10:26.959 --> 10:29.060
No. Ain't nobody say nothing
about lying, just, you know,

10:29.095 --> 10:30.895
I mean, if she doesn't
ask you...

10:32.331 --> 10:35.867
...then there's no need to, uh,
volunteer information.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.702
Okay, if she does ask me?

10:37.737 --> 10:40.338
Well, I mean, we gonna be here
for a couple of days.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.973
You-you-- maybe you forgot.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.374
Yeah, she gonna buy that.

10:43.409 --> 10:46.010
"I forgot. Mom, I forgot."
(knock on door)

10:46.045 --> 10:48.813

wise-ass.

10:52.752 --> 10:53.885
Captain Grover.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
That's my name.
What can I do for you?

10:55.955 --> 10:58.956
I'm Officer Bennett.
I've been assigned to you.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.759
Assigned how?

11:01.794 --> 11:03.695
My captain thought
it might be a good idea

11:03.730 --> 11:05.963
if I chaperoned you
while you're in town.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.466
Dad. What's going on?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.034
Nothing, Will.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.403
Just give us a minute.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.139
Please, go back and tell your
captain that while it's sweet,

11:15.174 --> 11:18.276
and I appreciate it, I'm good.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.044
I don't need a babysitter. Okay?

11:20.079 --> 11:22.113
Well, my captain disagrees.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.348
He's concerned
for your well-being.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.050
Well, he needn't be.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.419
Clay Maxwell's in jail.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.989
And after tomorrow, he will have
exhausted all of his appeals.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.192
I got no reason to be
looking over my shoulder.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.695
It's not Clay
my boss is worried about.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.732
Huh.

11:42.935 --> 11:46.270
Oh. Okay.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.206
Well... (clears throat)

11:48.241 --> 11:51.008
...you probably too young
to know who Clay Maxwell is.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.377
He was my ex-partner
and he killed his wife

11:53.412 --> 11:56.848
of 20 years... so if
somebody down at the force

11:56.883 --> 11:58.516
has a problem with me
going after him,

11:58.551 --> 12:01.886
then perhaps
they shouldn't be cops.

12:01.921 --> 12:05.923
Well, he's not in prison
for murder, though, is he?

12:05.958 --> 12:09.127
No, he's not.

12:09.162 --> 12:13.097
He's in prison because he stole
some money from a crime scene,

12:13.132 --> 12:15.233
and he wasn't as good
at covering that up

12:15.268 --> 12:17.502
as he was about covering up
killing his wife.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.871
No, he's there
because you turned him in.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.206
Look here, young fella.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.976
Your youth is showing right now.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.279
See, you look confused about
the code between guys like us.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.915
That code doesn't apply to guys

12:30.950 --> 12:32.450
who murder their wives
in cold blood.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.386
That code doesn't apply to a guy
who would send a dope dealer

12:35.421 --> 12:37.455
and a bent FBI agent
after his ex-partner

12:37.490 --> 12:39.390
and his family
to kill them.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.225
That's right.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.427
That was a special day
out in the jungle,

12:43.462 --> 12:46.464
probably could've used
a tough guy like you.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.333
Maybe you'd have
learned something.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.035
See, now my wife and my kids,

12:51.070 --> 12:52.970
they have to spend
the rest of their lives

12:53.005 --> 12:55.506
wrapping their mind around
the fact that their friend,

12:55.541 --> 12:59.177
a man who my kids considered
to be an uncle to them,

12:59.212 --> 13:00.444
wanted them dead

13:00.479 --> 13:02.280
because he was pissed
that he got caught

13:02.315 --> 13:04.048
and now he's
sitting in jail.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.218
But since we're
speaking frankly,

13:07.253 --> 13:09.854
let me say this about that.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.523
I don't give a damn what you

13:12.558 --> 13:17.128
or any other rank-and-file cop
thinks about me.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.096
'Cause they don't know me.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.500
And they damn sure
didn't know Clay.

13:22.535 --> 13:26.337
You let that sink in.

13:26.372 --> 13:30.007
Now, me and the boy, we're gonna
go down to Georgie's,

13:30.042 --> 13:31.876
we're gonna have some deep dish.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.045
If you should happen
to be there, by all means,

13:34.080 --> 13:38.115
please come over to our booth,
sit down and enjoy a slice.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.483
And don't you open your mouth

13:39.518 --> 13:42.320

shoving food into it.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.977
they're telling me
the place delivers. Let's go.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.446
Okay.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.616
(door bells jingle)

22:53.539 --> 22:55.673
(soldiers speaking Japanese)

22:57.042 --> 22:59.643
Guys, looks like
they're almost finished.

22:59.678 --> 23:02.747
If we're gonna make a move,
we need to make it now.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.418
Hey!

23:08.954 --> 23:10.654
Yeah, you. Come here.
I need to talk to you.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.122
Come here for a second,
won't you, please?

23:12.157 --> 23:13.056
What are you doing?

23:13.092 --> 23:14.191
Ordering room service,
what do you think?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.192
I got an idea.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.527
I'd like to hear it.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.694
Hey, hey, listen.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.029
I need to talk to Matsu.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.597
That's not gonna happen.

23:20.632 --> 23:21.832
No, trust me, I got something.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.467
He's gonna want to hear this.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.538
♪ ♪

23:37.015 --> 23:39.517
(whispering)

23:46.058 --> 23:47.991
So, you're looking to buy
your freedom, is that it?

23:48.026 --> 23:49.993
How much money
are we talking about?

23:50.028 --> 23:53.030
$20 million. At least.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.465
You expect me to believe

23:54.500 --> 23:56.867
Michelle Shioma
left that kind of money on Oahu?

23:56.902 --> 23:58.001
Listen, your boss left
in a hurry.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.971
Maybe she figured she was gonna
go back for it someday.

24:01.006 --> 24:02.906
$20 million?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.642
That's right.
I take you to the money.

24:05.677 --> 24:09.113
Once you take possession of it,
you release my team.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.983
WOMAN:
He's lying.

24:19.525 --> 24:22.593
You look like
you've seen a ghost, Commander.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.761
Although, under
the circumstances,

24:24.796 --> 24:27.064
I guess you have.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.133
We need to leave.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.570
(grunts)

24:33.605 --> 24:35.038
I wish you didn't do that.

24:35.073 --> 24:36.740
Take him back to his cell.

24:38.944 --> 24:39.877
SOLDIER:
Get up!

24:43.181 --> 24:44.215
(soldiers grunting)

24:57.029 --> 24:58.496
(punches landing)

24:59.698 --> 25:01.064
(groans)

25:01.099 --> 25:02.032
(gun cocks)

25:02.067 --> 25:04.101
(soldiers speaking Japanese)

25:06.204 --> 25:08.772
(grunts)

25:08.807 --> 25:10.908
KONO: Are you okay,
Steve? Come on.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.644
Yeah, yeah.

25:14.947 --> 25:18.081
All right.
(panting)

25:18.116 --> 25:20.117
Michelle Shioma's alive.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.856
What? Yeah, we were just
having a little catch up.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.157
They said she was dead.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.258
Well, she wanted us
to believe that.

25:28.293 --> 25:29.259
DANNY:
Okay, great news.

25:29.294 --> 25:30.961
Shioma's alive.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.162
I don't suppose
you got us

25:32.197 --> 25:34.197
invited to
the welcome home party, huh?

25:34.232 --> 25:36.700
No, but I did one better.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.570
(panting)

25:39.605 --> 25:41.071
I got this.

25:41.106 --> 25:41.905
DANNY:
Oh, that's why

25:41.940 --> 25:43.740
you went out there,
to get a bullet.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.275
Great, now maybe you can
go back out there,

25:45.310 --> 25:47.144
get your ass kicked again
and get a gun

25:47.179 --> 25:48.779
to put the bullet in.
How 'bout that?

25:48.814 --> 25:51.148
I'm gonna use the
gunpowder inside of this

25:51.183 --> 25:52.316
to blow the lock.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.953
Is that gonna work?

25:55.988 --> 25:58.222
I hope so.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.225
All right, Will,

26:02.260 --> 26:04.294
I'm gonna be gone
most of the day.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.296
So, you get hungry,

26:06.331 --> 26:10.100
you pick up the phone,
you call room service,

26:10.135 --> 26:11.835
order whatever you want, okay?

26:11.870 --> 26:13.136
Got it.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.172
(TV playing quietly)

26:17.109 --> 26:18.108
You scared?

26:18.143 --> 26:21.778
Scared? Scared for what?

26:21.813 --> 26:25.248
You know how many times
I've been in court testifying?

26:25.283 --> 26:28.051
Nothing to be scared of.
It's gonna be a cakewalk.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.220
Really? 'Cause...

26:30.255 --> 26:32.289
you didn't sleep all night.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.859
And how do you know that?

26:35.894 --> 26:37.661
You didn't snore.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.830
Oh, yeah,
that's your mother talking.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.164
I don't know, though.

26:41.199 --> 26:45.135
Maybe it's some good
cop deductive reasoning.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.170
Perhaps you have the gene.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.239
Yeah. Well,
take that gene

26:49.274 --> 26:51.808
and that tool and stick it
back on your tool belt,

26:51.843 --> 26:53.677
'cause you won't be needing it
where you're going,

26:53.712 --> 26:55.078
which is the operating room.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.214
Dad, I'm gonna be a chef.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.982
(chuckles): Yeah.
Yeah, that'll pass.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.819
So, um...

27:03.288 --> 27:06.289
...what happened last night
with those cops?

27:06.324 --> 27:07.958
Son, why are you
such a young person

27:07.993 --> 27:10.027
and worry about every
little thing like an old person?

27:10.062 --> 27:11.895
You can't be worried about
every little thing.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.997
It was nothing, okay?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.734
Do you still think
you made the right decision?

27:18.203 --> 27:21.104
I mean, that was your friend.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.774
That was your friend, you know.
That was Uncle Clay.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.677
Yeah. Your Uncle Clay sent
some people to kill us, too,

27:26.712 --> 27:28.011
you remember that?

27:28.046 --> 27:30.147
Yeah.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.282
Son,

27:32.317 --> 27:35.352
I've made plenty of mistakes.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.888
And I'm not ashamed of 'em,
I don't deny 'em.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.457
Made a lot of mistakes.
I'm just like anybody else.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.192
However...

27:42.227 --> 27:44.928
putting Clay Maxwell
where he is now

27:44.963 --> 27:46.897
was not one of 'em.

27:46.932 --> 27:48.265
Okay?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.337
Son, let me explain
something to you.

27:56.374 --> 27:59.309
The time is coming in your life

27:59.344 --> 28:02.779
where you're gonna have to make
a lot of important decisions.

28:02.814 --> 28:06.083
Decisions that are gonna make
you unpopular sometimes,

28:06.118 --> 28:08.952
decisions that are gonna
make people not like you.

28:08.987 --> 28:12.489
Decisions that are not
gonna make you feel good.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.258
As a matter of fact, a
lot of those decisions

28:15.293 --> 28:17.794
are gonna make you...

28:17.829 --> 28:19.763
sick to your stomach.

28:19.798 --> 28:22.299
But you got to make 'em
anyway. You know why?

28:22.334 --> 28:25.001
Because if you don't,

28:25.036 --> 28:28.004
you'll never be able
to live with yourself.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.306
You understand?

28:29.341 --> 28:31.275
Yes, sir.

28:36.848 --> 28:39.316
You're a good boy.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.251
Yeah. I love you.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.753
Love you, too.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.421
Hey, don't go crazy
on this room service.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.289
All right?
This ain't<i> Home Alone</i>

28:46.324 --> 28:47.424
and you ain't Macaulay Culkin.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.826
Yes, sir.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.762
All right.
(door opens)

28:54.432 --> 28:57.267
GROVER: Well, good morning,
Officer Bennett.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.468
Captain.

28:58.503 --> 28:59.903
You ready to go?

28:59.938 --> 29:01.471
Yes, sir.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.508
But you're not coming.

29:04.543 --> 29:05.909
Excuse me?

29:05.944 --> 29:07.477
You heard me.
My voice carries.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.545
I'm going down
to the courthouse.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.213
You're gonna stay here.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.015
Look, all right,
I got my orders...

29:12.050 --> 29:14.318
I don't give a damn
about your orders. I'll be fine.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.989
But that's my boy here
in this room.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.291
Okay?

29:21.326 --> 29:23.293
Now, he and the rest
of my family

29:23.328 --> 29:25.428
have already been put
in harm's way once before,

29:25.463 --> 29:28.231
behind this same thing.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.499
He's been through a living hell.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.334
You know where
he had his bar mitzvah?

29:31.369 --> 29:34.337
In the jungle,
getting chased and shot at,

29:34.372 --> 29:37.340
thinking his old man
was gonna die.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.142
He didn't deserve that.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.344
Nobody deserves that.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.280
Least of all, him.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.549
He's 15.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.884
After that whole ordeal,

29:47.919 --> 29:50.387
I'm thinking this whole thing
with Clay Maxwell,

29:50.422 --> 29:54.457
it's over now,
but it's become clear to me

29:54.492 --> 29:56.393
that it might never be over.

29:56.428 --> 30:01.298
So... get this
and get it straight:

30:01.333 --> 30:04.000
if anything and I mean anything
happens to my boy

30:04.035 --> 30:06.469
because somebody's got a problem
with something that I did,

30:06.504 --> 30:09.372
I will come back to this city
and I will rain down

30:09.407 --> 30:11.041
holy hell on
the Chicago Police Department,

30:11.076 --> 30:12.876
the likes of which
they've never seen.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.245
The first person
I'm coming after is you!

30:15.280 --> 30:17.414
Because you're gonna stand
in front of this door

30:17.449 --> 30:20.250
and you're gonna
look after my boy.

30:20.285 --> 30:24.020
And when I come back...

30:24.055 --> 30:26.156
when I come back,

30:26.191 --> 30:28.291
you and me...

30:28.326 --> 30:30.527
we're not gonna
see each other anymore.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.830
You understand?

30:37.469 --> 30:39.169
Listen, kid.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.042
Thank you.

30:54.619 --> 30:56.353
LUKELA:
<i>Got your message.</i>

30:56.388 --> 30:58.521
Everything all right?

30:58.556 --> 31:00.224
Uh, no.

31:02.227 --> 31:04.461
Okay, look,
Five-O went to Lanai yesterday,

31:04.496 --> 31:06.096
chasing a lead
on Michelle Shioma,

31:06.131 --> 31:07.564
and I haven't heard
from them since.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.399
They could have gone dark
for security reasons.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.268
I don't know.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.636
(computer beeping)
These satellite images

31:12.671 --> 31:14.371
show activity in a
supposedly abandoned area

31:14.406 --> 31:16.673
five miles south
of Polihua Beach.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.508
I believe those figures
to be Yakuza.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.676
And it looks like

31:19.711 --> 31:21.678
they're getting
ready to roll out.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.413
Look, McGarrett said
not to tell anyone

31:23.448 --> 31:25.382
what they were up to,
but I don't care.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.250
I don't care if I get
fired over this.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.518
Something's happened,
Five-O's in trouble.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.253
I just know it.

31:30.288 --> 31:32.255
Then we better get over there.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.357
Yeah, the thing is,

31:34.392 --> 31:37.093
McGarrett believes that
the Yakuza may still have moles

31:37.128 --> 31:38.328
inside HPD.

31:38.363 --> 31:40.297
Not the guys I go to.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.998
You sure you can trust 'em?

31:42.033 --> 31:43.567
Trust with my life.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.603
Let's go get our friends.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.650
All right, guys,
get in the back, hug the cage.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.456
(groans)

32:22.474 --> 32:23.473
(neck cracks)

32:39.224 --> 32:40.623
We're under fire!

32:40.658 --> 32:42.292
SOLDIER (over radio):
I repeat, we're taking fire!

32:42.327 --> 32:44.127
(gunfire in distance)

32:47.165 --> 32:48.465
Raise anchor.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.267
I'm not leaving
my men behind.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.374
We're leaving.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.477
(gunfire continues)

33:22.801 --> 33:24.034
(gun clicks empty)

33:24.069 --> 33:25.168
I'm out.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.803
Me, too.

33:26.838 --> 33:27.771
Flank them, now!

33:29.174 --> 33:30.573
Steve, we got to fall back.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.009
(gun clicks empty)

33:34.279 --> 33:37.180
I'm out, too.
Welcome to the club.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.315
We can fall back, but are we
gonna outrun their bullets?

33:39.350 --> 33:41.051
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:42.187 --> 33:44.187
(speaks Japanese)

33:45.256 --> 33:48.058
(helicopters approaching)

34:01.539 --> 34:03.240
(soldiers grunting)

34:13.818 --> 34:15.585
OFFICER: Drop your weapon.
Get on your knees.

34:15.620 --> 34:16.853
Put your weapon down!

34:16.888 --> 34:18.488
All right, everybody
move in. Let's go!

34:18.523 --> 34:19.789
Freeze! Hands
on your head!

34:19.824 --> 34:22.159
Get down on the ground.

34:31.836 --> 34:35.238
There they are.
Jerry, we got 'em.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.574
Yes!

34:37.609 --> 34:39.676
(sighs)

34:39.711 --> 34:42.345
Duke, you there?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.347
Go ahead, Steve.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.116
Mahalo, buddy.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.817
We owe you big-time.

34:47.852 --> 34:50.220
Really, uh, you want to
thank Jerry for this.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.189
Jerry, you on the line?

34:53.224 --> 34:57.527
Uh, this is
Special Consultant Ortega, over.

34:57.562 --> 34:59.596
STEVE: I don't know
what to say, Jerry.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.366
I mean, you, uh, you disobeyed
a direct command.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.469
I know, but so did a man
named James Tiberius Kirk

35:06.504 --> 35:07.670
in a little movie called

35:07.705 --> 35:08.871
<i>Star Trek III:</i>
<i>The Search for Spock.</i>

35:08.906 --> 35:12.575
And, like him, I'm prepared
to accept the consequences.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.311
But right now, you guys
got a trawler to catch.

35:15.346 --> 35:16.613
Don't worry about that.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.315
My guys are already in pursuit.

35:30.528 --> 35:31.728
<i>(door buzzes)</i>

35:37.468 --> 35:39.836
You know something,
I think your men

35:39.871 --> 35:43.339
were wrong about you,
Michelle.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.909
I think you're much smarter
than your father.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.244
DANNY:
Absolutely. I agree.

35:48.279 --> 35:49.512
Sticking around
instead of taking off

35:49.547 --> 35:51.681
somewhere else to hide,
that was very smooth.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.950
She wasn't just hiding,
she was operating

35:53.985 --> 35:57.387
under our noses
for almost a year.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.489
Anyway, look,
there's something

35:59.524 --> 36:01.591
I came in here to tell you--
I think it's important.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.459
I know for a fact
that you're planning on

36:03.494 --> 36:05.495
going to the U.S. District
Attorney's Office.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.966
Cut a deal,
give 'em some information

36:10.001 --> 36:12.235
about other clans,
get a lighter sentence.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.838
Whatever it is,
you need to know...

36:15.873 --> 36:18.675
that I'm gonna do
everything in my power

36:18.710 --> 36:19.809
to stop that happening.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.811
There's not gonna be
any deals, okay?

36:21.846 --> 36:24.247
You came after us,

36:24.282 --> 36:25.915
and you came after
our families.

36:25.950 --> 36:29.553
And for that,
you get to die in prison.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.824
Maybe, maybe not.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.861
Most of the people
I threaten in this room,

36:38.896 --> 36:40.763
they back down
at least a little bit,

36:40.798 --> 36:41.931
but not you, huh?

36:41.966 --> 36:45.335
It must be a gene
you Shiomas have.

36:47.338 --> 36:49.272
Luckily, it skipped
a generation.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.576
With your daughters,
I mean.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.878
Oh, you didn't think
we'd find your daughters?

36:55.913 --> 36:59.349
And the family that you hid
them with is very eager

36:59.384 --> 37:02.952
to cooperate with us, as long as
the girls are left out of it.

37:02.987 --> 37:05.488
Maybe you are planning
on cutting a deal.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.824
You may even be thinking
about breaking out.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.025
But I think

37:09.060 --> 37:11.527
that for the sake
of your daughters

37:11.562 --> 37:14.697
and the fact that maybe
they get to grow up

37:14.732 --> 37:17.934
outside of
a government institution...

37:19.937 --> 37:21.871
...you're not gonna do that.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.709
Good to see you.

37:26.744 --> 37:27.978
(door buzzes)

37:31.716 --> 37:32.983
(door slams)

37:48.566 --> 37:50.267
Go ahead, pick it up.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.003
It's mine?

37:54.038 --> 37:56.706
Does McGarrett know?

37:58.376 --> 38:00.777
Does McGarrett know?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.045
About what?

38:04.015 --> 38:05.615
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.050
Yeah, I know about it.

38:09.387 --> 38:11.388
You saved our
lives, Jerry.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.025
It's been a long
time coming.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.328
You deserve it.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.345
(winces)

38:35.380 --> 38:38.081
Here, let me help you.
Let me help you.

Yeah.
