A modern man.

00:25.384 --> 00:27.978
'Then take The Funday Times
for a shit.'

00:28.024 --> 00:29.423
God, oh dear.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.342
- Another horrible bit?
- Yeah.

00:32.384 --> 00:34.420
'Look at me. I've got a girlfriend.

00:34.464 --> 00:38.218
'A proper girlfriend, reading a
bestseller about child abuse.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.824
'I go out and have croissants.

'and there's no way
anyone can prove otherwise.'

00:49.504 --> 00:52.735
So where do you know this
rich bitch from, then?

00:52.784 --> 00:56.140
She's not a rich... Merry's a good
friend of mine and Mark's from uni.

00:58.464 --> 00:59.579
Super Hans!

00:59.624 --> 01:03.903
What? because it's a computer, you think it's
made of spiders' webs and magic?

01:03.945 --> 01:05.981
It's just a metal box, Jez,
they're indestructible.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.539
Really? Because
it looks like it's not...

01:08.585 --> 01:11.019
Hey guys...

01:11.065 --> 01:13.181
How's it going?
Oh, God, I can't get over

01:13.225 --> 01:16.058
how lucky I am to find you, Jez.

01:16.105 --> 01:18.016
'Canadian Merry.
She probably thinks

01:18.065 --> 01:20.659
'I'm getting nowhere with my music,
and that's why I'm doing removals.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.742
'I'll tell her all the cool bands
do removals.

01:23.785 --> 01:26.219
'I'll say Franz Ferdinand
have got their own van.'

01:26.265 --> 01:30.053
It just feels like everything
is coming together. Doesn't it?

01:30.105 --> 01:32.903
Yeah, I guess it does.
Not too sad, though,

01:32.945 --> 01:35.778
what with your mum dying,
and everything?

01:35.825 --> 01:39.500
No, no. Who needs mums? She wasn't
there when I did my ballet exam,

01:39.545 --> 01:44.141
she's not here for me now,
so fuck her.

01:44.185 --> 01:46.653
Yeah, that's a good attitude,
probably.

01:46.705 --> 01:48.138
Too right.

01:48.185 --> 01:50.983
I'm looking for a couple of hip
young gunslingers

01:51.025 --> 01:52.253
to run the pub for me downstairs.

01:52.305 --> 01:54.375
What, that's yours? You own the pub?

01:54.425 --> 01:55.574
I used to run a pub.

01:55.625 --> 01:58.776
Are you kidding?
Would you be interested?

01:58.825 --> 02:02.135
What, us, run a pub?

02:02.185 --> 02:06.497
Well, I've never really thought
about it before, but now that I do,

02:06.545 --> 02:09.901
I think I'd probably like to do that
more than anything else in the world.

02:09.945 --> 02:12.743
Yeah. I am very
particular about the kind

02:12.785 --> 02:14.662
of establishment I run, though.

02:14.705 --> 02:16.855
It needs to make a
political statement, yeah?

02:16.905 --> 02:19.260
A very strong political statement.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.057
Does it? Are you sure?

02:21.105 --> 02:24.701
Because I really don't think
it does, if it's a pub.

02:24.746 --> 02:27.340
Well, that my position,
and it's a deal breaker.

02:30.786 --> 02:31.821
Whee!

02:34.266 --> 02:38.305
'Oh God.
Thank God, thank God it's ending.

02:38.346 --> 02:41.144
'Finally. I've still got
all my fingers intact, too.'

02:41.186 --> 02:42.585
Are you OK?

02:42.626 --> 02:45.220
Yeah, yeah, that was fun.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.575
'Urgh, I feel awful.
I suppose doing things you hate

02:47.626 --> 02:51.141
'is just the price you pay
to avoid loneliness.'

02:51.186 --> 02:53.541
So, what next?

02:53.586 --> 02:56.942
Well, they all look garish and
unsafe, so why don't you choose?

02:56.986 --> 02:57.975
MOBILE BEEPS

02:58.026 --> 02:59.539
Oh, hold on.

02:59.586 --> 03:02.146
'My girlfriend...

03:02.186 --> 03:04.222
'standing next to her boyfriend

03:04.266 --> 03:07.736
'reading a text like it's
the most natural thing in the world.

03:07.786 --> 03:09.378
'I do feel very queasy.'

03:09.426 --> 03:11.257
Oh, Mark.

03:11.306 --> 03:13.183
Mark, this is so weird. Wow.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.775
Are they spamming you
about upgrading to 3G?

03:16.826 --> 03:18.703
No, listen. I applied for this thing.

03:18.746 --> 03:21.135
Barbara said I should,
and I didn't think it would come off.

03:21.186 --> 03:23.142
So I didn't mention.

03:23.186 --> 03:25.495
But it looks like
I might get a promotion.

03:25.546 --> 03:28.106
Well, that's brilliant.

03:28.146 --> 03:31.138
Which would mean me moving
to Bristol.

03:31.186 --> 03:33.575
- 'Oh my God.'
- Permanently.

03:35.106 --> 03:37.381
Ah! Are you OK?

03:37.426 --> 03:42.181
Yeah.
Yeah, just queasy from the waltzer.

03:42.226 --> 03:46.061
Of course. I'm so sorry this
has come up now, we need to talk.

03:46.107 --> 03:48.098
No, really, it's the waltzer.

03:48.147 --> 03:51.025
I'm happy for you. Really.

03:55.387 --> 03:59.699
So, this is the place you're
going to be running for Merry?

03:59.747 --> 04:01.100
Yeah.

04:01.147 --> 04:02.136
Blimey.

04:02.187 --> 04:05.224
So, this is a pub?

04:05.267 --> 04:07.337
Well, it was, and it will be again.

04:07.387 --> 04:10.697
Just imagine, me in the pub all day,
but no one can say anything,

04:10.747 --> 04:12.738
because it's my job,
so I've got to be there.

04:12.787 --> 04:14.903
I'll literally
get paid to go to the pub.

04:14.947 --> 04:17.461
Yeah, I guess it won't be quite like

04:17.507 --> 04:19.781
being paid just to go to the pub,
because you'll be doing pub stuff

04:19.827 --> 04:23.661
- the barrels, the tubes,
the debit card authorisations.

04:23.707 --> 04:27.586
Mark, do you have to live quite
so relentlessly in the real world?

04:27.627 --> 04:31.097
OK, Jez, fine, but have you
done your market research?

04:31.147 --> 04:33.456
Market research?

04:33.507 --> 04:37.420
"If you build it, they will come."
That's my market research.

04:37.467 --> 04:39.742
Your market research
is Field Of Dreams?

04:39.787 --> 04:44.258
I mean, a man who made a baseball
pitch in his garden for ghosts.

04:44.307 --> 04:45.660
That's your role model?

04:45.707 --> 04:47.299
Oi-oi. >

04:48.387 --> 04:50.821
Mr Motivator.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.176
I'm sure this place is
gonna be great.

04:53.227 --> 04:56.902
Yeah, well you're barred. Because I
can do that, I have the power to bar.

04:56.947 --> 05:00.542
And I won't necessarily be using
it wisely or compassionately.

05:03.427 --> 05:04.986
Oh, yeah.

05:05.028 --> 05:06.541
Fuck, yeah, look at this place.

05:06.588 --> 05:09.261
Yeah, I know.
Still, we can move all this crap out

05:09.308 --> 05:11.060
and put a bar, what, over there?

05:11.108 --> 05:12.905
No, mate, no way.

05:12.948 --> 05:15.018
Don't change nothing. It's perfect.

05:15.068 --> 05:16.786
Perfect?

05:16.828 --> 05:18.341
It doesn't even look like a pub.

05:18.388 --> 05:22.017
Exactly. I've been down enough
City boy chain pubs

05:22.068 --> 05:25.981
with their logos in the foam
and disinfectant in the lager.

05:26.028 --> 05:27.859
Air-freshener in the mayo?

05:27.908 --> 05:30.980
No, I want to run a place
that makes a difference.

05:31.028 --> 05:33.542
Yeah. Well, I'm sure we
can sort that out somehow.

05:33.588 --> 05:36.102
Let's start by getting rid of this.

05:36.148 --> 05:38.059
That stays.

05:38.108 --> 05:40.747
That's the reason I fell
in love with this place.

05:40.788 --> 05:42.506
You want a washing machine in the pub?

05:42.548 --> 05:44.266
It'll freak 'em out.

05:44.308 --> 05:46.583
What the fuck's a washing
machine doing in a pub?

05:46.628 --> 05:49.426
Jesus, I need a drink. Yeah?

05:49.468 --> 05:52.301
And boom, they'll have to have
one of our organic scrumpies.

05:52.348 --> 05:56.580
Right, the thing is, Hans, as I've
said before, I really just think

05:56.628 --> 06:00.541
we should serve at least
one lager, and nuts.

06:00.588 --> 06:02.704
You know, people like lager and nuts.

06:02.748 --> 06:05.546
People like Coldplay
and voted for the Nazis.

06:05.588 --> 06:07.101
You can't trust people, Jeremy.

06:07.148 --> 06:09.582
Maybe I should go solo.

06:09.628 --> 06:12.017
I'm starting to have
serious doubts about you.

06:17.188 --> 06:19.907
I can't believe Sophie's just gone.

06:19.948 --> 06:22.337
Do you think she'll stay faithful?

06:22.388 --> 06:25.221
Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.
People always do.

06:25.268 --> 06:27.021
Yeah, I guess.

06:27.069 --> 06:29.458
Thanks, mate.

06:29.509 --> 06:31.659
Really nice of Merry to
invite us to the flat-warming.

06:31.709 --> 06:34.507
Oh, that's Merry.
God, she's such a laugh.

06:34.549 --> 06:37.143
Didn't you two even have a
thing, back in Darty?

06:37.189 --> 06:40.147
No, we never had a thing.

06:40.189 --> 06:42.828
I thought, didn't you stay over in
her room, the night we did all

06:42.869 --> 06:46.066
the blues - Blues Brothers, Betty
Blue, Blue Velvet, the Big Blue?

06:46.109 --> 06:48.259
Well yes, but nothing happened.

06:48.309 --> 06:51.346
I definitely remember you writing
that very long letter in marker pen,

06:51.389 --> 06:54.426
and then having a
freak-out and burning it.

06:54.469 --> 06:56.539
That was you, wasn't it?

06:56.589 --> 06:59.786
So, the pub.
What are you calling it?

06:59.829 --> 07:03.060
No problem there.
I mean, we're deadlocked on that,

07:03.109 --> 07:07.148
and a few other things, but
I'm definitely not co-managing

07:07.189 --> 07:09.657
a pub called Free The Paedos.

07:09.709 --> 07:12.223
Right, yes.

07:12.269 --> 07:13.702
I can see that.

07:13.749 --> 07:16.627
'Maybe I should get off with
someone at Merry's party,

07:16.669 --> 07:18.387
'in case Sophie does in Bristol.

07:18.429 --> 07:21.819
'Yeah, right. When was the last time
I got off with someone at a party?

07:21.869 --> 07:24.827
'Well, there was Carol Bananaface,

07:24.869 --> 07:27.258
'but that was just
a macabre charade.'

07:27.309 --> 07:30.301
OK, party time
for the El Dude Brothers!

07:30.349 --> 07:31.702
Agh! Agh!

07:31.749 --> 07:33.307
Agh!

07:33.349 --> 07:35.817
'God, life is futile.'

07:35.869 --> 07:37.746
I'm so glad you guys could make it.

07:37.789 --> 07:38.983
Right.

07:39.029 --> 07:40.906
Merry, where is everyone?

07:40.949 --> 07:44.544
Everyone who?
No-one else is coming, it's just us.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.740
Just us?

07:46.790 --> 07:48.303
Yeah.

07:48.350 --> 07:53.549
Look, I'm just going to call Sophie,
check, see what she's up to.

07:53.590 --> 07:56.388
Now listen, Jez,

07:56.430 --> 07:58.227
about the pub.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.659
'Oh, shit, here it comes.
The dream dies.'

08:00.710 --> 08:02.268
I'm going to get rid of the pub.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.948
Oh, right. I just thought

08:03.990 --> 08:06.345
maybe if we could manage it
for a little while...

08:06.390 --> 08:07.823
- Do you want it?
- What?

08:07.870 --> 08:09.906
You see, I'm going to get rid of it.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.703
It's just this big thing
sitting underneath me.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.627
You mean, like own it?

08:14.670 --> 08:16.979
Please take it. Please.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.019
Well, OK, sure.

08:18.070 --> 08:20.425
- Agh!
- Oh my God!

08:20.470 --> 08:23.906
Hey, fuck you, Mark.
The world's not all wrong sometimes.

08:23.950 --> 08:26.942
I'm calling Super Hans.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.423
What's he...

08:28.470 --> 08:29.425
Oh, Mark.

08:29.470 --> 08:32.188
You've turned into
quite a hunk, haven't you?

08:32.230 --> 08:33.948
You're a hunky.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.424
Well, it may surprise you
to learn that

08:36.470 --> 08:37.982
no-one's ever said that to me.

08:38.030 --> 08:41.739
You want to put your
popsicle into my purse?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.269
'Oh, God, I'm being propositioned.'

08:43.309 --> 08:47.462
I wrote you a letter, I didn't
send it, but I don't know if you...

08:47.510 --> 08:50.343
'Letter? Popsicle? This isn't good.'

08:50.390 --> 08:52.585
Right, thank you.

08:52.630 --> 08:55.667
You know,
my bone's got a little machine.

08:55.710 --> 08:58.383
Does it? Really?

08:58.430 --> 09:01.263
OK, I'm just going
to go to the bathroom.

09:01.310 --> 09:03.949
'Maybe I should follow her.
She's so hyper,

09:03.990 --> 09:06.504
'she's probably really great at sex.
But there's always the chance

09:06.550 --> 09:10.226
'I'll get the toilet seat
slammed on my cock for no reason.'

09:10.271 --> 09:12.626
Yeah, totally. But Hans,

09:12.671 --> 09:16.584
all of our major differences would
just kind of drift away

09:16.631 --> 09:20.101
as long as we don't try
and confront them too early. Yeah?

09:20.151 --> 09:23.029
OK, right, I'll see you down there.
Yeah, yeah.

09:23.071 --> 09:26.507
Jeremy, I think
something's wrong with Merry.

09:26.551 --> 09:30.226
She... made a pass at me.

09:30.271 --> 09:33.980
You've got such low
self-esteem, haven't you?

09:34.031 --> 09:35.669
No, Jez, this is serious.

09:35.711 --> 09:38.464
I'm worried about her.
She's not right in the head.

09:38.511 --> 09:42.663
Oh, rubbish. She's always been
a bit full on. She's kooky.

09:42.711 --> 09:45.703
Don't you think -
the party, the pub.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.662
I think she's gone a bit funny.

09:47.711 --> 09:49.622
Oh, right. Now I get it.

09:49.671 --> 09:52.139
She has some faith in Jeremy,
hence she must be mental.

09:52.191 --> 09:56.150
Listen, guys, news flash. If you
need to shit, shit in the bin.

09:59.711 --> 10:02.179
OK, maybe she is a bit up and down.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.224
Hey, Soph, long time no speak.
How's it going?

10:07.271 --> 10:11.059
'Oh, my God, she would have got it
by now, unless Amazon screwed up.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.545
'Except they're so damn efficient.'

10:13.591 --> 10:15.582
'So, I got the book you
sent me, Vox, thanks.

10:15.631 --> 10:18.099
'You know what it's
about, don't you, Mark? '

10:18.151 --> 10:19.709
- Er, no.
- 'Phone sex.'

10:19.751 --> 10:21.707
Oh, blimey.

10:21.751 --> 10:24.823
'I wouldn't be against something
like that, maybe it would be fun.'

10:24.871 --> 10:29.548
Oh, OK, so, do you want to start?

10:29.592 --> 10:30.581
'No, you start.'

10:30.632 --> 10:33.430
OK, I'll just dive in, shall I?

10:33.472 --> 10:34.951
'What am I going to say?

10:34.992 --> 10:38.143
'Clinton would know what to say.
Blair would know what to say.

10:38.192 --> 10:40.422
'Even Putin would know what to say.'

10:40.472 --> 10:43.782
Have you... Have you got... nice tits?

10:43.832 --> 10:45.265
'Well, it's not for me to say,
but... '

10:45.312 --> 10:46.870
You have, you really have.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.551
And feet and arms.

10:49.592 --> 10:52.425
You know, I don't want to
just focus on the sexual parts.

10:52.472 --> 10:55.703
'Look, listen, we might have
to try going a bit dirtier, OK? '

10:55.752 --> 10:57.265
OK, good.

10:57.312 --> 11:02.944
'OK, so a guy's just walked in here,
a big, nice guy without his pants on.

11:02.992 --> 11:05.108
'And he's got a big hard-on.'

11:05.152 --> 11:07.108
He goes. Can we get rid of him?

11:07.152 --> 11:09.712
He goes and puts his pants on.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.141
It's just you and me and...

11:12.192 --> 11:16.344
and Andrew Neil's
interviewing us about politics.

11:16.392 --> 11:19.782
But when the camera's not on us,
we're all hot.

11:19.832 --> 11:23.711
I'm just screwing you, and there's
nothing Andrew Neil can do about it.

11:23.752 --> 11:26.141
- 'Who's Andrew Neil? '
- It doesn't matter.

11:26.192 --> 11:28.148
DOOR SHUTS

11:28.192 --> 11:30.945
Hi, Mark, it's Jeremy.
I'm with Merry, she was outside.

11:30.992 --> 11:32.789
Someone's coming in.

11:32.832 --> 11:33.821
'I'm not into that.'

11:33.872 --> 11:36.944
No, Sophie, he's back,
I've got to go.

11:36.992 --> 11:39.426
Hey, Mark. The Mark man.

11:39.472 --> 11:43.431
Merry's come for her instructions
about the curly whirly cuckoo.

11:43.472 --> 11:44.700
I get the message.

11:44.752 --> 11:46.583
'What the hell is she doing? '

11:46.632 --> 11:51.229
Look, listen, Merry,
have you got any phone numbers

11:51.273 --> 11:55.391
for brothers, sisters, or... people?

11:55.433 --> 11:58.584
Numbers?
Oh yeah, I've got some numbers.

11:58.633 --> 12:00.305
Could you give us the numbers?

12:07.473 --> 12:09.509
Merry, that's just three numbers.

12:09.553 --> 12:12.226
I can put some more if you like.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.183
Merry, I just wonder,

12:16.233 --> 12:19.862
maybe you should be heading home.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.302
Shall we call you a cab?

12:23.873 --> 12:25.989
Yeah, let's call you a cab.

12:29.793 --> 12:31.624
What do you think we should do?

12:31.673 --> 12:35.302
I don't know, I'm scared.
This isn't usual.

12:35.353 --> 12:37.628
Is this your sharpest razor?

12:37.673 --> 12:42.064
It better be sharp, because
I have a damn important meeting.

12:48.873 --> 12:51.831
There you go, nice and tucked.

12:51.873 --> 12:55.183
I can hardly move under here,
I'm just tucked up so tight.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.673
That's good tucking.

12:56.673 --> 12:59.790
That's fine.

12:59.833 --> 13:03.109
What are we going to do, Mark?
She's gone literally bonkers.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.428
I don't know.

13:05.473 --> 13:08.146
I think we should try
and contact someone who's...

13:08.193 --> 13:11.310
- Got more responsibility for her than us?
- Exactly.

13:11.353 --> 13:13.231
But no mum now.

13:13.274 --> 13:17.426
Did she once say something
about an uncle in Canada?

13:17.474 --> 13:20.147
- Who else is there?
- Pedge?

13:20.194 --> 13:22.913
I don't think he's going to take
her off our hands, he works in HMV.

13:22.954 --> 13:25.752
Shit. I just don't know.

13:25.794 --> 13:27.022
We could try the number.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.871
Her three-digit number?

13:30.114 --> 13:32.708
It's worth a try.

13:32.754 --> 13:35.348
It's not going to work.

13:35.394 --> 13:36.747
It doesn't work.

13:36.794 --> 13:39.547
OK, OK, I guess we've just got to

13:39.594 --> 13:42.666
bloody take responsibility,
haven't we?

13:42.714 --> 13:46.150
Hello, NHS Direct?

13:46.194 --> 13:49.266
Hi. Listen, I want to get
my friend sectioned.

13:49.314 --> 13:52.465
Yes, but I don't know
what the procedure is.

13:52.514 --> 13:54.630
How easy would that be to do?

13:54.674 --> 13:57.586
Would I have to be involved
or could I just give you

13:57.634 --> 14:00.194
the house number and assure
you that she's mental?

14:00.234 --> 14:04.113
'lf it turns out to be easy, I could get
a few other troublesome people sectioned.

14:04.154 --> 14:06.349
Get Mark sectioned,
get his nice big room.

14:06.394 --> 14:09.352
'I guess it might cause
a bit of a bump in the friendship,

14:09.394 --> 14:13.387
'but we got over the coffee rings
on the dining table incident. Eventually.

14:13.434 --> 14:16.346
- They're putting me through somewhere.
- Cool.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.109
Hi, Soph, me again.

14:20.154 --> 14:23.544
Really am leaving a lot of
messages for you today, I know.

14:23.594 --> 14:26.188
'So, Merry's gone. If I got sectioned,

14:26.234 --> 14:28.873
'I'd put up more of a fight.
Downside, might get lobotomised.'

14:28.914 --> 14:31.474
Seriously, it's fine,
not calling back.

14:31.514 --> 14:34.632
I hope it's not because
I hung up in the middle of our...

14:34.675 --> 14:37.473
you know... thing.

14:37.515 --> 14:41.952
But really do please call me back.

14:41.995 --> 14:46.511
All my w-w-warmest wishes, Mark.

14:49.195 --> 14:50.913
Ridiculous sign-off.

14:50.955 --> 14:52.673
Not sending her a birthday card.
DOOR BUZZER

14:52.715 --> 14:53.830
Still nothing?

14:53.875 --> 14:56.435
Six calls, nothing back.

14:56.475 --> 14:59.069
I wasn't going to call again,
but then I thought,

14:59.115 --> 15:03.586
Merry being sectioned, a nugget of
sad but interesting news.

15:03.635 --> 15:05.785
Right. A talking point.

15:08.715 --> 15:11.024
Did you try and get me sectioned?

15:11.075 --> 15:12.906
What? Of course not.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.832
Somebody tried to get me sectioned.

15:14.875 --> 15:18.629
Jeremy! Super Hans is here.
Did you try and get him sectioned?

15:18.675 --> 15:21.030
What? Me? No.

15:21.075 --> 15:24.385
- Why, did you try to get him sectioned?
- Of course not.

15:24.435 --> 15:26.505
Well somebody tried
to get me sectioned

15:26.555 --> 15:28.591
and nobody gets
Super Hans sectioned.

15:28.635 --> 15:30.830
Well, I definitely didn't
try to get you sectioned.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.752
'That sounded pretty convincing.'

15:32.795 --> 15:35.514
I guess it was just one of those
freaky urban things

15:35.555 --> 15:38.023
like those people
who go on fire for no reason.

15:38.075 --> 15:40.953
Yeah. So listen,

15:40.995 --> 15:43.555
I've been busting a gut
trying to sort the pub.

15:43.595 --> 15:46.507
I tried to get European Bob
on board but he's a jerk-off.

15:46.555 --> 15:48.750
He's still stuck in the crisp age.

15:48.795 --> 15:51.673
What next? Bloody mead on tap?

15:51.715 --> 15:54.276
Yeah, right, arsehole.

15:54.316 --> 15:57.467
So, what do you think?
The old team back together?

15:57.516 --> 16:01.350
Well, maybe,
but we need to agree on some stuff.

16:01.396 --> 16:03.910
Like, and don't fly off the handle,

16:03.956 --> 16:07.107
but I'm really not happy
with the name Free The Paedos.

16:07.156 --> 16:13.345
Can't we call it something more
normal, like The Swan And Tomato?

16:13.396 --> 16:16.991
Yeah. Or compromise?

16:17.036 --> 16:19.470
The Swan And Paedo.

16:19.516 --> 16:22.952
Yeah, OK, sure.
And what about lager...

16:22.996 --> 16:24.793
Details. Listen.

16:24.836 --> 16:27.350
We need to get some fucking
proof of ownership.

16:27.396 --> 16:29.626
We need property deeds. Keys cut,

16:29.676 --> 16:32.065
borrow some start up wonga
for the overheads.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.993
So, let's go over to Merry's.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.709
Ah, could be a problem there.

16:36.756 --> 16:39.475
Merry, you see,
Merry's been sectioned.

16:39.516 --> 16:42.906
Merry's been sectioned?
You're kidding!

16:42.956 --> 16:44.435
Jesus.

16:44.476 --> 16:46.990
Who's going to be next?

16:48.636 --> 16:51.196
'lncredible.
Still no call from Soph.

16:51.236 --> 16:56.549
'lf she's broken up with me,
maybe I could consider Merry.

16:56.596 --> 16:59.793
'It would sort of suit me to have
a girlfriend in an institution.

16:59.836 --> 17:03.351
'Regulated meeting times. I might
get to have a say in her medication.

17:03.396 --> 17:07.708
'I'd like to be able to chemically
alter my girlfriend's moods.'

17:07.756 --> 17:11.351
Well, I have to say,
she's looking a lot better.

17:13.076 --> 17:16.114
We'll just grab her stuff
and get her out your hair.

17:16.156 --> 17:18.387
No, I'm afraid Merry needs to
be kept a close eye on just now.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.473
But she's fine.
She's always been the life and soul.

17:21.517 --> 17:25.066
Tabasco in your pint, frisbee in the
kitchen, that's Merry. She's kooky.

17:25.117 --> 17:27.790
She's in the acute stage
of a manic episode.

17:27.837 --> 17:29.429
What do you think, Merry?

17:29.477 --> 17:31.229
I just want...

17:31.277 --> 17:32.505
Everything's too much right now.

17:32.557 --> 17:35.310
Shall we?

17:35.357 --> 17:38.554
'At least she isn't proposing
sexual intercourse any more.'

17:38.597 --> 17:39.950
Mark? >

17:39.997 --> 17:42.227
Can you give these to Jeremy?

17:42.277 --> 17:44.632
They're kind of important.

17:44.677 --> 17:47.987
'Probably stopped fancying me now
the sedatives have kicked in

17:48.037 --> 17:49.755
'and she's lost the beer goggles.

17:49.797 --> 17:52.755
'Normal service has been resumed.'

17:52.797 --> 17:55.152
Come on, mate, let her go,
it's for the best.

17:55.197 --> 17:57.711
Look, it might take us a
month or so just to see what

17:57.757 --> 18:01.067
kind of drug or cognitive therapies
might help Merry with her condition.

18:01.117 --> 18:02.596
Oh, right, I see.

18:02.637 --> 18:05.868
Your little world is threatened by
all the amazing Jack Nicholsons

18:05.917 --> 18:07.908
and Robin Williamses burning so bright

18:07.957 --> 18:10.266
you've got to keep them down
with your chemical cosh.

18:10.317 --> 18:14.356
Come on, man, set her free.
All she needs is a vodka and tonic.

18:14.397 --> 18:18.026
I'm sorry, but there's no way I
can sign her out. She's not well.

18:18.077 --> 18:23.197
Your dream is just everyone on the
omnibus, grey, eating grey sludge.

18:23.237 --> 18:25.273
That's your dream, isn't it?

18:25.317 --> 18:26.386
No.

18:26.437 --> 18:28.632
We'll look after her.

18:28.677 --> 18:30.793
She's just wacky, basically fine.

18:30.837 --> 18:34.716
She's not fine,
she's temporarily... mad.

18:34.757 --> 18:36.476
You're with them now, are you, Mark?

18:36.518 --> 18:39.396
Tell me, is it mad to be
diagnosed with a mental disorder

18:39.438 --> 18:43.351
or is it in fact much more mad
to get up every morning to go to

18:43.398 --> 18:46.868
your boring job so you can print
out lots of meaningless documents?

18:46.918 --> 18:50.593
I'm sorry about this, it's the '60s,
he thinks he's living in the '60s.

18:50.638 --> 18:54.472
How about this?
You let her go and we promise,

18:54.518 --> 18:56.588
promise, to keep her restrained.

18:56.638 --> 18:58.230
Tightly tied.

18:58.278 --> 19:01.634
I appreciate how passionately
you feel about your friend

19:01.678 --> 19:05.034
but there's no way I can sign her out.
I'm sorry.

19:05.078 --> 19:08.115
Look, Merry wanted me
to give you these deeds.

19:08.158 --> 19:12.276
I'm not sure why or what...

19:12.318 --> 19:15.754
OK, fair enough, mate,
I've said my piece, but you win.

19:15.798 --> 19:17.709
After all, you're the expert.

19:17.758 --> 19:19.271
OK, guys, let's go.

19:26.558 --> 19:28.753
So, Jez, why is she
giving you these?

19:28.798 --> 19:31.631
Those? I don't know. They're not
important. Just give them to me.

19:31.678 --> 19:35.227
The deeds to the pub?
Of course they're important.

19:35.278 --> 19:37.746
In fact, why do you even need them?

19:37.798 --> 19:40.266
Oh, yeah, didn't I tell you?

19:40.318 --> 19:42.878
She's giving us the place.
So just hand them over, really.

19:42.918 --> 19:44.271
She gave it to you?

19:44.318 --> 19:47.390
Well, yeah, it's all perfectly
legal, probably, Mark.

19:47.438 --> 19:49.030
I don't see
what you're worried about.

19:49.078 --> 19:53.310
But she's not in her right mind.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.394
She was fine when
she gave us the pub.

19:55.438 --> 19:57.669
Well, are you sure? I guess giving

19:57.719 --> 20:01.155
away a pub that's worth several
thousands of pounds for free,

20:01.199 --> 20:03.997
that kind of suggests you haven't
got your best thinking cap on?

20:04.039 --> 20:05.950
Mark, we're not exploiting her.

20:05.999 --> 20:09.071
Once we turn the pub into a cash
cow, we'll give her some cream.

20:09.119 --> 20:10.108
Yeah, right.

20:10.159 --> 20:12.957
Look, I just think in
this situation, Merry needs

20:12.999 --> 20:15.718
an impartial adviser like me
to help her decide what's best.

20:15.759 --> 20:17.590
God, you're loving this, aren't you?

20:17.639 --> 20:22.349
Holding the deeds like Mr Monopoly
with his top hat and his iron.

20:22.399 --> 20:25.152
Do you really think
if you don't give us her pub,

20:25.199 --> 20:26.996
she's going to let you screw her?

20:29.479 --> 20:31.629
Oh, God, that is low.

20:31.679 --> 20:33.795
That is really nuts.

20:33.839 --> 20:36.433
Are you saying I'm mad?
Is that what you're saying?

20:36.479 --> 20:38.071
Are you going to try
to get me sectioned

20:38.119 --> 20:39.996
for simply following my dream?

20:40.039 --> 20:43.156
I just think the best thing is if
I hand these to the authorities

20:43.199 --> 20:44.791
and let them decide.

20:47.119 --> 20:49.428
Hi, there, doctor, I just wondered
if you could take care of...

20:49.479 --> 20:51.947
He's gone nuts.

20:51.999 --> 20:53.352
He's out of his mind.

20:53.399 --> 20:57.074
I'm not out of my mind, I just
need to give you some documents.

20:57.119 --> 21:01.635
He was running round with his cock out
before, saying it was on fire. He's lost it.

21:01.679 --> 21:06.673
He thinks there's a pigeon in Catalonia
that's in control of his legs.

21:06.719 --> 21:08.198
I really don't.

21:08.239 --> 21:09.513
Jeremy, tell him.

21:10.599 --> 21:17.277
Well, I don't know,
mostly he's OK but maybe,

21:17.319 --> 21:20.551
maybe you should keep him in for
observation for a couple of days.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.318
Jeremy, are you?

21:22.360 --> 21:26.114
If anyone's going nuts here,
it's not me, it's you.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.435
They could section you
for trying to section me.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.278
If you try to section me,
you'll have crossed the line

21:31.320 --> 21:34.278
and I will section you so help me.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.790
Guys, you've had your fun
with the sectioning.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.354
There's going to be no more
sectioning today.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.078
'OK, act shocked, act shocked.'

21:48.120 --> 21:49.155
God, Sophie.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.235
Jesus, Mark.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.952
This is so weird.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.195
I'm just on my way to Oxford
for a training day

21:54.240 --> 21:56.754
at the Institute of Finance.
You must be, what?

21:56.800 --> 21:59.792
Changing here on your way
to the Birmingham rep seminar?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.239
Yeah, God, wow.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.918
'God, she almost seems
to believe me.'

22:02.960 --> 22:06.999
So, why haven't you called? You
haven't called for over a week.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.430
Seeing you here by chance, I might
as well find out why you haven't called.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.516
I thought you'd be busy
with your new girlfriend.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.436
What?

22:13.480 --> 22:17.234
Your new girlfriend who you're in
love with. Merry. Remember?

22:17.280 --> 22:19.430
Or do you fall in love
with people all the time?

22:19.480 --> 22:22.711
Merry? You think... Merry?

22:22.760 --> 22:25.274
She told me, Mark.
I called, she answered.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.276
She was in your bed, "All tucked up
tight," as she put it.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.596
Look, Merry's nuts, Sophie.
She's mentally ill.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.552
She's been incarcerated.
She stayed one night

22:33.600 --> 22:35.909
then the white van came
to take her away.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.155
Don't embarrass
yourself, Mark, it's fine.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.510
Soph, look at me, honestly,
she's in hospital.

22:40.561 --> 22:43.553
I can give you her reference number.

22:43.601 --> 22:47.753
Oh, right, well,
I did think it was kind of...

22:47.801 --> 22:50.952
So as far as you're
concerned we're still...

22:51.001 --> 22:54.073
For the last few days I've been
under the impression that...

22:54.121 --> 22:57.830
You haven't
done anything, have you, Soph?

22:57.881 --> 23:00.076
Er, no. Not really.

23:00.121 --> 23:02.840
Not really?

23:02.881 --> 23:07.796
Well, it's complicated
and nothing happened, really.

23:07.841 --> 23:10.913
But now I think it'll be all right.

23:12.481 --> 23:14.676
Anyway, I've got to get my...

23:14.721 --> 23:16.951
I'll call you later, OK?

23:19.241 --> 23:20.230
Bye.

23:20.281 --> 23:22.397
'Nothing happened, really.

23:22.441 --> 23:26.354
'The three least comforting words
in the English language.'
