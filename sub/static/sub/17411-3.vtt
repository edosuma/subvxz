       HOLDING HER HAND.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.698
  - YOU KNOW, MY SON, MARCUS,
       WAS A LATE POOPER.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.800
    AND IT WAS ROUGH GOING.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.002
    BUT ACTUALLY, IT TURNED
        OUT TO BE RATHER

06:11.004 --> 06:13.672
  A BONDING EXPERIENCE FOR US.
             - OH.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.673
WHAT KIND OF WINE YOU GOT THERE?

06:14.675 --> 06:16.508
       - GLASS OF SHIRAZ.
             - OH.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.709
       - SHIRAZ-A-MATAZ.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.846
     - AH, SHIRAZ-A-MATAZ.
          - [laughing]

06:20.848 --> 06:23.849
      - I'VE NEVER HAD IT.
             - MM.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.752
     - PROBABLY DELICIOUS.
    - NOT REALLY, ACTUALLY.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.986
    DOES THE TRICK, THOUGH.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.056
             - AH.
          - [laughing]

06:35.061 --> 06:36.395
         [bright music]

06:36.397 --> 06:38.029
     - OH, HERE'S THE ONE.
           - [gasps]

06:38.031 --> 06:39.831
          SO GORGEOUS,
          AREN'T THEY?

06:39.833 --> 06:40.732
    - AND WILL DOESN'T EVEN
           KNOW THEM.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.967
            I MEAN,
       WOULD IT KILL HIM

06:41.969 --> 06:43.135
     TO LEARN THEIR NAMES?

06:43.137 --> 06:44.836
  - HE MUST KNOW THEIR NAMES.
             - NO.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.972
HE ONLY KNOWS THAT MY KID'S NAME
            IS JONAH

06:46.974 --> 06:48.573
   BECAUSE HE STOLE THE NAME

06:48.575 --> 06:49.741
    WHEN HE WAS USING MARCUS
          TO GET LAID.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.644
     - YES, I RECALL THAT.
       WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.413
     - I REALLY LIKE THAT,
       BUT I'M A TOE GUY.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.680
     - IT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT?

06:55.682 --> 06:56.848
   TOES DON'T NEED TO SCREAM
       ANYTHING, DO THEY?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.116
            - WELL--
      - RIGHT, MORE BOOZE.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.818
           [clatter]
          OH, BUGGER.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.686
        DO YOU SEE THAT?
     I'VE GOT TO FIX THAT.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.754
           - LET ME.
          I CAN DO IT.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.656
        - ARE YOU HANDY?
         - SO HANDY...

07:04.658 --> 07:06.491
       THAT THEY CALL ME
         "HANDY ANDY."

07:06.493 --> 07:07.793
         - THEY DON'T.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.662
    - BUT YOU GOT ANY TOOLS?
     I CAN PROBABLY FIX IT.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.598
   - YEAH, I'VE GOT A LOVELY
  CROCHET TOOL BELT, ACTUALLY.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.933
      - OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
           LOVE THIS.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.735
     ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TAKE
       THE USUAL, KITTY--

07:16.737 --> 07:18.804
         TWO PRIME RIB
       FRENCH DIP SLIDERS

07:18.806 --> 07:21.039
     AND TWO BELGIAN FRIES
   WITH THE PEPPER JACK MAYO.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.475
 - OH, UH, NO PEPPER JACK MAYO
            FOR ME.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.578
        THEY ARE FAMOUS
  FOR THEIR PEPPER JACK MAYO.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.148
  - WELL, I'M FAMOUS FOR BEING
      LACTOSE INTOLERANT.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.051
  DO YOU HAVE ANY HEMP SPREAD?

07:35.221 --> 07:36.822
   THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE SAYS
         YOU COULD USE

07:36.824 --> 07:38.790
   SOME HEMP SPREAD TOO, BRO.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.992
      - YOU KNOW HOW HARD
       I WORKED ON LAURIE

07:40.994 --> 07:43.795
TO GET HER TO AGREE TO HAVE WILL
       BE THE GODFATHER?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.096
  RIGHT? I LOVE HER TO DEATH,

07:45.098 --> 07:46.965
  BUT SHE'S JUST NOT AS CHILL
       AS YOU ARE, FIONA.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.034
      - OH, THANKS, ANDY.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.970
   YOU KNOW, AND THEN HE JUST
      FLAT-OUT REJECTS ME.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.839
      I MEAN, DOESN'T EVEN
       TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

07:53.841 --> 07:54.806
      HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
        MY BEST FRIEND,

07:54.808 --> 07:56.608
     AND HE DOESN'T EVEN--
             - YO!

07:56.610 --> 07:57.742
      JUST DROPPING OFF--

07:57.744 --> 07:58.944
         WHAT THE HELL
       IS GOING ON HERE?

07:58.946 --> 07:59.945
       - HELLO, DARLING.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.947
        - DID YOU PAINT
         YOUR TOENAILS?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.582
     - JUST TESTING COLORS.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.816
      NOTHING'S GOING ON.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.551
     HANDY ANDY IS ENJOYING
          THE COMPANY

08:06.553 --> 08:07.786
    OF A CONSIDERATE FRIEND.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.221
 - NICE BAILING TONIGHT, WUSS.

08:09.223 --> 08:12.657
        - OH, I'M SORRY.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, NOT JONAH?

08:12.659 --> 08:13.658
            [laughs]
              OH!

08:13.660 --> 08:14.759
    - YEAH, NO, HE'S MY KID.

08:14.761 --> 08:15.861
            - RIGHT.

08:15.863 --> 08:19.664
         ONE LOUSY HOUR
    OF INCONVENIENCE TO YOU,

08:19.666 --> 08:20.732
    AND THEN WE COULD'VE HAD
         OUR NIGHT OUT.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.834
            BUT NO.
   - I AGREE WITH HANDY ANDY.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.703
     - WELL, I WAS ENJOYING
    THE COMPANY OF A FRIEND

08:24.705 --> 08:27.205
    WHO'S FREE TO HAVE FUN,
          WINE TEETH.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.508
      PROVIDED HE FINISHES
      HIS HOMEWORK FIRST.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.109
   - WELL, I THINK HANDY ANDY
      NEEDS TO GROW A SET

08:31.111 --> 08:32.210
       AND QUIT BAILING.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.879
           - MARCUS!
        - IN MY DEFENSE,

08:33.881 --> 08:35.714
         I HAVE NO IDEA
    WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANS.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.649
        - YOU KNOW WHAT?
        I'M OUTTA HERE.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.817
     THANKS FOR A FUN TIME.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.219
          - OH, I SEE.
         BAILING AGAIN.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.155
       - I'M NOT BAILING.
   I'M JUST BLOWING YOU OFF.

08:44.157 --> 08:48.159
       [whistles, laughs]

08:48.161 --> 08:49.828
    [door opens and closes]
          - [inhales]

08:49.830 --> 08:51.062
    IT WAS A SHIRAZ, RIGHT?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.964
            - 2005.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.800
 - ANDY IS EITHER NEVER AROUND,
          WHICH SUCKS,

08:55.802 --> 08:58.570
    OR HE BAILS COMPLETELY,
          WHICH BLOWS.

08:58.572 --> 09:02.107
        SO AS A FRIEND,
     ANDY SUCKS AND BLOWS.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.776
      - YES, I CAN SEE HOW
     HIS DEMANDING SCHEDULE

09:04.778 --> 09:07.746
            TRAMPLES
  ON YOUR BOUNDLESS FREE TIME.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.147
    - YOU KNOW, YOUR SARCASM
         IS INEFFECTIVE

09:09.149 --> 09:10.849
AGAINST MY ABSOLUTE RIGHTNESS--

09:10.851 --> 09:12.150
            ALTHOUGH
     HALFWAY THROUGH THAT,

09:12.152 --> 09:15.186
       I CLOSED MY EYES,
 AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE ADELE.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.788
  - DO YOU HAVE ANY AWARENESS
   OF THE CHALLENGES GOING ON

09:16.790 --> 09:18.189
   IN ANDY'S LIFE RIGHT NOW?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.758
    - YEAH, HIS BEST FRIEND
       IS PISSED AT HIM.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.226
       - ANDY AND LAURIE
 HAVEN'T BEEN ALONE IN MONTHS.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.628
     ALEX HAS ANXIETY GOING
   TO KINDERGARTEN EVERY DAY,

09:23.630 --> 09:25.597
 AND MADISON CAN'T POOP UNLESS
 ANDY IS STANDING RIGHT THERE.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.965
            - YEAH!
     HOW ANNOYING IS THAT?

09:26.967 --> 09:30.001
    AN ABSOLUTELY ONE-SIDED
     FRIENDSHIP WITH ANDY.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.236
    - ANDY SAID THAT TO YOU?

09:31.238 --> 09:35.774
     - NO, I'M SAYING THAT,
      AND SO WOULD ADELE.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.578
          IT'S ALWAYS
      ALL ABOUT YOU, WILL.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.080
  - IT IS WITH PROFOUND GRACE
          AND HUMILITY

09:42.082 --> 09:44.583
         THAT I ACCEPT
        YOUR INVITATION

09:44.585 --> 09:47.819
      TO BE THE LITTLE...

09:47.821 --> 09:50.622
    BABY JONAH'S GODFATHER.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.756
            - UH...
           [chuckles]

09:51.758 --> 09:52.791
     YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.826
           THE OFFER
      HAS BEEN RESCINDED.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.828
        - RESCINDED? HA.
             WHAT?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.831
    - THE APPROPRIATE ANSWER
    WHEN WE FIRST ASKED YOU

09:59.833 --> 10:01.132
    WOULD HAVE BEEN TO WEEP

10:01.134 --> 10:02.901
     AND SAY THAT YOU'D BE
        DEEPLY HONORED.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.703
          BUT INSTEAD,
         YOU SNUBBED US

10:04.705 --> 10:06.771
       AND MADE ANDY JUMP
      OUT OF A MOVING CAR.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.874
       HE OPENED THE DOOR
         AND FLEW OUT!

10:09.876 --> 10:11.610
        - YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, OKAY?

10:11.612 --> 10:13.311
 - ANDY, HELP ME OUT HERE, MAN.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.114
        - THE TRUTH IS,
 YOU'RE NOT GODFATHER MATERIAL.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.816
            - WHAT?
  - IT'S REALLY HARD TO RAISE

10:17.818 --> 10:18.850
          A KID, WILL.
      - YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.786
       - THERE'S NO TIME
       FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.388
  WE'RE SO BEHIND ON <i> HOMELAND,</i>

10:23.390 --> 10:25.657
       WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
   IF ABU NAZIR IS A BAD GUY.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.659
  - ABU NAZIR IS A TERRORIST!

10:27.661 --> 10:28.960
  IT COULDN'T BE ANY CLEARER!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.729
     - HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD
       OF SPOILER ALERTS?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.831
    - HONESTLY, THIS HURTS.
      THIS HURTS ME, MAN.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.299
      - OH, YOU HAVE PAIN.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.834
           [laughing]
              OH.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.168
       THAT'S HILARIOUS.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.770
       - IT'S HILARIOUS.
    - ANDY WAS SO DEVASTATED

10:38.772 --> 10:40.839
    BY YOUR SHODDY TREATMENT
        OF HIM YESTERDAY

10:40.841 --> 10:43.141
   THAT HE COULDN'T EVEN GET
    OUT OF BED THIS MORNING.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.143
         - OH, REALLY?
  IS THAT WHY YOU COULDN'T GET

10:45.145 --> 10:46.211
    OUT OF BED THIS MORNING?

10:46.213 --> 10:48.747
            - YEAH.
           - REALLY?

10:48.749 --> 10:51.116
        'CAUSE I THOUGHT
    IT WAS BECAUSE HE DRANK

10:51.118 --> 10:52.851
     TWO BOTTLES OF SHIRAZ

10:52.853 --> 10:56.988
   WITH MY NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR
       FIONA LAST NIGHT!

10:56.990 --> 10:59.391
            - WHAT?
             WHAT?

10:59.393 --> 11:01.359
             - I--
    - WHO THE HELL IS FIONA?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.994
 - THE WOMAN HE SPENT THE NIGHT
        WITH LAST NIGHT.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.996
           - THAT'S--
 - SPENT THE NIGHT WITH, ANDY?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.732
       - HONEY, WE--I HAD
 A LITTLE BIT OF WINE WITH HER

11:07.734 --> 11:08.867
      BECAUSE HE'D ALREADY
           GONE OUT.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.168
           ALL WE DID
    WAS TALK ABOUT THE KIDS.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.236
       THAT'S ALL WE DID.

11:11.238 --> 11:15.173
     - IS THAT ALL YOU DID,
          HANDY ANDY?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.275
           - AW, MAN.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.713
         - WHO THE HELL
         IS HANDY ANDY?

11:21.715 --> 11:25.850
             ANDY.
- I MAY HAVE FIXED HER CABINET.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.885
           THANK YOU.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.219
          - HEY, MAN.

11:31.158 --> 11:35.093
    BUT YOU COULDN'T ADJUST
     YOUR PLANS BY AN HOUR.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.361
           ONE HOUR.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.263
        - IT'S NOT JUST
    ABOUT LAST NIGHT, ANDY.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.732
      YOU NEVER HAVE TIME
        FOR ME ANYMORE.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.467
     I MEAN, WE'VE WATCHED
   THE SUPER BOWL EVERY YEAR

11:42.469 --> 11:44.002
       SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,

11:44.004 --> 11:47.138
  AND LAST YEAR, I GOT TICKETS
       TO THE SUPER BOWL,

11:47.140 --> 11:49.174
           AND YOU--
     AND YOU BAILED ON ME.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.377
         - FOR MY WIFE,
   WHO WENT INTO LABOR, MAN.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.146
      - AH, SHE KNEW I GOT
      THOSE TICKETS, MAN.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.082
   I THINK SHE SELF-INDUCED.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.218
           - [crying]

12:05.024 --> 12:07.358
    - OH! THAT'S DISGUSTING.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.393
       - THAT'S MY LIFE.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.195
           ALL RIGHT?
     AND THE FACT THAT YOU

12:10.197 --> 12:11.930
          CONSISTENTLY
     DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT--

12:11.932 --> 12:15.166
THAT YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME
     TO BOND WITH THE KIDS.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.334
      YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
          THEIR NAMES.
