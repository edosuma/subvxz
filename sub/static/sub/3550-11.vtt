WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.276
A FRIENDSHIP WAS TORN APART.
 I CARE ABOUT MY FRIENDS.

00:05.276 --> 00:08.007
SORRY YOU ARE NO LONGER
A PART OF THAT GROUP.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.041
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
 WHAT? HERE?

00:10.041 --> 00:13.184
BREE'S AFFAIR WAS REVEALED
TO ORSON.

00:13.184 --> 00:15.616
MONA THREATENED ANGIE.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.619
YOU'VE GOT TILL TOMORROW TO COME
UP WITH THE REST OF THE MONEY,

00:18.619 --> 00:21.422
OR I GO TO THE POLICE.
 AND THEN TRAGEDY STRUCK.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.095
CELIA!

00:31.302 --> 00:34.305
(siren wailing)

00:34.305 --> 00:36.367
I'M AT THE SITE
OF A BIZARRE ACCIDENT

00:36.367 --> 00:38.369
THAT HAPPENED JUST HOURS...

00:38.369 --> 00:40.371
(Mary Alice) IF YOU WATCH
THE NEWS TONIGHT,

00:40.371 --> 00:43.074
YOU WILL BE TOLD
ALL ABOUT A TRAGEDY

00:43.074 --> 00:45.776
THAT OCCURRED
ON A QUIET SUBURBAN STREET.

00:45.776 --> 00:49.780
YOU WILL HEAR EYEWITNESS
ACCOUNTS OF THE CRASH.

00:49.780 --> 00:53.354
YOU WILL LEARN THE EXTENT
OF THE DAMAGE.

00:53.354 --> 00:57.528
BUT THE NEWS CAN'T TELL YOU
WHO SURVIVED.

00:57.528 --> 01:01.192
BECAUSE NO ONE YET KNOWS...

01:01.192 --> 01:03.764
FOR SURE.

01:03.764 --> 01:08.139
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

01:08.139 --> 01:09.600
(sighs)

01:09.600 --> 01:11.642
OH, SUSAN,
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

01:11.642 --> 01:13.274
I WAS ON MY WAY HOME.
I GOT THIS TEXT FROM JULIE.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.576
SHE SAID A PLANE CRASHED
ONTO THE LANE?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.579
YEAH.
 A SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE THAT HAD
TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.852
THE PILOT HAD A HEART ATTACK.
 JULIE SAID KARL WAS
TAKEN AWAY IN AN AMBULANCE?

01:21.852 --> 01:24.415
YEAH. HE'S IN SURGERY.

01:24.415 --> 01:27.388
H-H-HOW BAD IS IT?
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT, RIGHT?

01:27.388 --> 01:29.320
THERE WAS A LOT OF BLEEDING.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.123
THE DOCTORS ARE DOING
THE BEST THEY CAN.

01:32.123 --> 01:34.625
YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?
HERE. H-HAVE A SEAT.

01:34.625 --> 01:37.298
COME HERE.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.829
WAS ANYONE ELSE HURT?

01:38.829 --> 01:41.272
ORSON... AND MONA CLARKE.

01:41.272 --> 01:43.134
YEAH, THEY'RE STILL IN SURGERY.

01:43.134 --> 01:45.136
BREE GOT A LITTLE BANGED UP,

01:45.136 --> 01:48.139
BUT THE NURSE SAYS
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
 AND LITTLE CELIA
MIGHT HAVE A CONCUSSION.

01:48.139 --> 01:51.142
OH... WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
 THE PLANE WAS HEADED
STRAIGHT FOR HER,

01:51.142 --> 01:54.185
AND LYNETTE RAN OVER
AND PUSHED HER OUT OF THE WAY.

01:54.185 --> 01:57.188
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.
 COME ON. YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING FOR MY KIDS.

01:57.188 --> 01:58.589
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

01:58.589 --> 02:01.852
NO, LYNETTE,
WE OWE YOU EVERYTHING.

02:01.852 --> 02:05.556
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
 I GUESS WE JUST WAIT
AND PRAY.

02:05.556 --> 02:10.130
I THINK
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

02:16.907 --> 02:19.710
(inhales sharply)

02:19.710 --> 02:20.911
OW.

02:20.911 --> 02:23.544
LYNETTE, ARE YOU OKAY?

02:23.544 --> 02:25.576
(whispers) I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

02:25.576 --> 02:28.279
(normal voice) I HAVE
THIS TERRIBLE PAIN.

02:28.279 --> 02:29.820
THE TRUTH IS,

02:29.820 --> 02:34.525
NO ONE KNOWS WHO WHO SURVIVED
THAT TRAGIC PLANE CRASH...

02:34.525 --> 02:36.357
(voice breaks) OH, TOM,

02:36.357 --> 02:40.231
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BABIES.

02:40.231 --> 03:03.254
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHO DIDN'T.

03:03.254 --> 03:04.915
ANY WORD ABOUT KARL?

03:04.915 --> 03:07.918
UH, STILL IN SURGERY.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.662
GOD, I FEEL LIKE
SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

03:11.662 --> 03:14.825
AFTER THAT GUY CHEATED ON YOU,
I HATED HIS GUTS.

03:14.825 --> 03:16.827
NEVER SPOKE TO HIM AGAIN.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.772
AND I WAS JUST IN THE CHAPEL
PRAYING FOR HIM.

03:21.772 --> 03:24.875
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

03:24.875 --> 03:29.840
IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED
FOR ME, TOO.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.715
WITH THAT, SUSAN BEGAN TO THINK
OF HER MARRIAGE TO KARL--

03:34.715 --> 03:39.390
HOW WONDERFULLY
IT HAD STARTED...

03:39.390 --> 03:42.523
HOW THEY'D BEEN SO HAPPY...

03:44.425 --> 03:47.258
UNTIL THE DAY
SHE FOUND LIPSTICK

03:47.258 --> 03:49.360
WHERE SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

03:53.464 --> 03:57.938
SUSAN THEN THOUGHT OF THE DAY
SHE TOLD KARL TO LEAVE,

03:57.938 --> 03:59.710
AND SHE WONDERED...

03:59.710 --> 04:02.943
WHAT IF SHE HADN'T?

04:05.476 --> 04:08.479
WAIT. WAIT! DON'T GO.

04:08.479 --> 04:10.321
YOU JUST KICKED ME OUT.

04:10.321 --> 04:12.653
I KNOW.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.656
I PUT 12 YEARS OF MY LIFE
INTO THIS MARRIAGE,

04:15.656 --> 04:17.628
AND WE HAVE A DAUGHTER.

04:17.628 --> 04:18.959
(sighs deeply)

04:18.959 --> 04:21.962
WE OWE IT TO JULIE
TO TRY TO WORK THIS OUT.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.634
AW, SUSIE.

04:23.634 --> 04:26.567
DON'T TOUCH ME.
YOU'RE STILL A PIG.

04:28.739 --> 04:30.441
(door closes)
 OKAY, SO, UM,

04:30.441 --> 04:33.374
IF WE ARE GONNA PUT THIS
BEHIND US,

04:33.374 --> 04:36.377
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYONE
THAT YOU'VE BEEN WITH

04:36.377 --> 04:38.379
SINCE WE WERE MARRIED.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.811
EVERYONE?
 (bags clatter)

04:40.811 --> 04:42.883
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.015
KARL, I DON'T WANT
TO BE WONDERING,

04:45.015 --> 04:47.518
WHEN WE GO TO A PARTY
OR A RESTAURANT,

04:47.518 --> 04:51.061
"DID HE SLEEP WITH HER?
HER? HER?"

04:51.061 --> 04:52.022
OKAY.

04:52.022 --> 04:54.365
WELL, YOU FOUND OUT
ABOUT BRANDY.

04:54.365 --> 04:55.896
YES.

04:55.896 --> 04:59.870
IT WAS NICE TO PUT THE PANTIES
WITH A FACE.

04:59.870 --> 05:01.001
GO ON.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.474
WELL, BEFORE HER...

05:03.474 --> 05:04.935
LET'S SEE...

05:04.935 --> 05:08.979
IT WAS AMBER,
THE DENTAL HYGIENIST...

05:08.979 --> 05:11.582
KWAN LEE,
THE MASSAGE LADY...

05:11.582 --> 05:14.084
OH, REMEMBER
WHEN WE HAD CABLE INSTALLED,

05:14.084 --> 05:17.948
AND YOU WONDERED WHY WE GOT
SO MANY CHANNELS FOR FREE?

05:17.948 --> 05:21.321
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
UH, MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.824
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SOME SECRETS
BETWEEN A COUPLE.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.326
(voice breaks) WHY DON'T
YOU JUST GO UPSTAIRS

05:26.326 --> 05:28.429
AND UNPACK YOUR STUFF?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.932
I WILL LEARN
HOW TO SWALLOW MY RAGE.
 YOU ARE NOT GONNA REGRET THIS.

05:53.424 --> 05:55.055
(sighs)

05:59.590 --> 06:02.062
(doorbell rings)

06:08.899 --> 06:11.702
HEY THERE. I'M MIKE DELFINO.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.373
OH, YES.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.376
WE MET AT, UM,
MARY ALICE'S FUNERAL.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.080
UH, YOUR HUSBAND TOLD ME
YOU HAVE A CLOGGED SINK.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.982
OH, YEAH. (chuckles)

06:21.982 --> 06:23.554
COME ON IN.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.391
(grunts)

06:31.391 --> 06:34.425
SO HOW YOU LIKING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO FAR?

06:34.425 --> 06:37.598
I LIKE IT.
IT SEEMS QUIET... FRIENDLY.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.500
IT IS. AND SAFE.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.402
I BET WE HAVE THE LOWEST
CRIME RATE IN AMERICA.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.705
(telephone rings)
 YOU NEED TO GET THAT?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.807
NAH. LET THE MACHINE GET IT.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.008
(ring)

06:48.008 --> 06:50.981
(Susan) Hi. It's Susan
and Karl. Leave us a message.

06:50.981 --> 06:52.983
(beep)
 (Karl) Hey, Suse. It's me.

06:52.983 --> 06:54.985
Listen,
I'm gonna be working late.

06:54.985 --> 06:56.987
Don't hold dinner for me.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.989
By the way, the switchboard's
gonna be closed,

06:58.989 --> 07:01.992
so don't bother calling.
Love ya.
 (beep)

07:01.992 --> 07:04.955
(sighs) HE'S SCREWING
HIS SECRETARY.

07:04.955 --> 07:07.498
HUH?

07:07.498 --> 07:08.899
MY HUSBAND.

07:08.899 --> 07:10.661
THINKS HE'S FOOLING ME.

07:10.661 --> 07:12.202
HE'S NOT.

07:12.202 --> 07:15.035
I'M SORRY.

07:19.510 --> 07:21.742
YOU KNOW, UH,

07:21.742 --> 07:24.675
WHAT WOULD SERVE HIM RIGHT...

07:24.675 --> 07:27.117
TO COME HOME

07:27.117 --> 07:31.081
AND FIND ME IN BED
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

07:33.123 --> 07:35.155
YEAH, I GOTTA GO.
 (tool clatters)

07:35.155 --> 07:38.589
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
 WELL, I'VE GOT TO GET A PART
AT THE HARDWARE STORE.

07:38.589 --> 07:41.131
MM.
 MM!

07:41.131 --> 07:43.534
AND THEY CLOSE AT 6:00.

07:43.534 --> 07:45.035
OH. OH, MY GOD.

07:45.035 --> 07:46.236
(dish clatters)

07:46.236 --> 07:48.639
AM I THAT UNDESIRABLE?

07:48.639 --> 07:52.002
NO, YOU'RE VERY DESIRABLE,
UH, I-IN--IN A BIG WAY.

07:52.002 --> 07:54.645
DID YOU JUST CALL ME FAT?

07:54.645 --> 07:57.477
NO. NO. I-I-I THINK
YOU'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.810
IT'S JUST...

07:59.810 --> 08:01.882
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MARRIED.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.183
OH.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.985
RIGHT. UM...

08:04.985 --> 08:06.557
I'M SORRY.

08:06.557 --> 08:08.819
LOOK...

08:08.819 --> 08:10.691
IF YOU'RE UNHAPPY,

08:10.691 --> 08:13.063
YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

08:16.166 --> 08:20.601
(door opens and closes)

08:34.044 --> 08:37.748
OH! (pants)

08:39.620 --> 08:40.890
OH, PLEASE.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.753
NOT ANOTHER BUSINESS TRIP.

08:44.755 --> 08:47.728
OH, PLEASE.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.760
LET IT BE
ANOTHER BUSINESS TRIP.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.002
I TRIED.

08:52.002 --> 08:53.634
I'M SORRY.

08:58.569 --> 09:00.170
THAT'S IT?

09:00.170 --> 09:02.012
15 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

09:02.012 --> 09:05.776
AND THAT'S ALL I GET--
TWO LOUSY SENTENCES?

09:05.776 --> 09:08.679
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO SAY.

09:08.679 --> 09:10.681
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW ABOUT, UM,

09:10.681 --> 09:12.252
"HEY, SUSAN,

09:12.252 --> 09:14.955
"THANKS FOR EATING NOTHING
BUT BROCCOLI AND COLON CLEANSER

09:14.955 --> 09:17.588
"FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS
SO YOU COULD LOSE WEIGHT

09:17.588 --> 09:19.089
AND LOOK GOOD FOR ME"?

09:19.089 --> 09:21.131
OR, "HEY, SUSAN,
THANKS FOR WASTING

09:21.131 --> 09:23.794
"THE BEST YEARS OF YOUR LIFE
WHILE I WENT OUT

09:23.794 --> 09:26.566
AND I BANGED EVERYTHING WITH
A G.E.D. AND A TRAMP STAMP."

09:28.899 --> 09:30.240
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

09:30.240 --> 09:32.943
BUT YOU COULD'VE
SPARED YOURSELF ALL THIS PAIN

09:32.943 --> 09:35.075
IF YOU'D JUST LET ME GO
THE FIRST TIME.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.748
(door opens)

09:41.682 --> 09:45.085
YOU REALLY DO DESERVE BETTER,
SUSAN.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.064
(car door closes)

10:01.601 --> 10:03.233
MRS. DELFINO?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.839
KARL DIDN'T MAKE IT.

10:08.839 --> 10:10.881
(gasps) OH.

10:10.881 --> 10:12.943
OH, MY GOD.

10:12.943 --> 10:15.646
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED,

10:15.646 --> 10:18.088
WE HAVE COUNSELORS
AVAILABLE.

10:18.088 --> 10:21.121
N-NO, I'LL--I'LL BE FINE.
THANK YOU.

10:27.197 --> 10:30.630
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU MUST BE FEELING.

10:32.903 --> 10:36.206
(sighs)

10:36.206 --> 10:39.169
MOSTLY I'M...

10:39.169 --> 10:42.272
I'M FEELING GRATEFUL.

10:52.082 --> 10:55.926
BREE HODGE WAS TOLD ABOUT
THE DEATH OF KARL MAYER

10:55.926 --> 10:58.128
AT 6:12 THAT EVENING.

10:58.128 --> 11:04.234
SHE BECAME SO HYSTERICAL
SHE HAD TO BE SEDATED BY 6:18.

11:04.234 --> 11:07.267
IT WASN'T LONG
BEFORE SHE FELL ASLEEP.

11:07.267 --> 11:11.001
AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO DREAM...

11:11.001 --> 11:15.205
A BEAUTIFUL DREAM ABOUT WHAT
HER LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE

11:15.205 --> 11:18.108
IF KARL HADN'T DIED.

11:18.108 --> 11:21.011
(squeals) YOU ARE SO CORNY!

11:21.011 --> 11:22.212
AHH.

11:22.212 --> 11:23.153
(chuckles)

11:23.153 --> 11:25.155
NO DEVIATING
FROM THE MARRIAGE PLAYBOOK.

11:25.155 --> 11:27.157
I'M DOING IT RIGHT THIS TIME.

11:27.157 --> 11:28.719
MM.

11:28.719 --> 11:29.890
MM.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.061
HAPPY?

11:31.061 --> 11:34.064
KARL, YOU'VE MADE ME HAPPY
IN WAYS I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

11:34.064 --> 11:35.996
MM.
 NOW IF IT WOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

11:35.996 --> 11:38.368
WOULD YOU MIND PULLING DOWN
MY ZIPPER WITH YOUR TEETH

11:38.368 --> 11:40.370
AND TAKING ME ON THE TABLE?

11:40.370 --> 11:42.432
(laughs) NAG, NAG, NAG.
 (laughs)

11:42.432 --> 11:45.205
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU WOMEN
ONCE YOU GET A RING ON?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.337
MM, AND IF YOU'RE A STICKLER
FOR TRADITION,

11:47.337 --> 11:50.110
WE COULD ALWAYS TAKE IT UP
TO OUR BEDROOM.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.043
OUR BEDROOM--
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

11:53.043 --> 11:55.215
(chuckles)
WELL, GET USED TO IT...
 MM.

11:55.215 --> 11:59.149
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE OUR
BEDROOM FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.
 MM. MM.

11:59.149 --> 12:00.190
MM.

12:00.190 --> 12:03.153
I MEANT WHAT I SAID
WHEN I PROPOSED.

12:03.153 --> 12:06.396
BEING WITH YOU IS GONNA MAKE ME
INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT MAN.

12:06.396 --> 12:10.030
WELL, I HOPE
NOT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.232
I DON'T EVER WANT TO LOSE
THAT SEXY BEAST

12:12.232 --> 12:14.835
WHO SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.107
MWAH!
 (laughs) WHOO!

12:17.107 --> 12:19.109
TRUST ME.
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

12:19.109 --> 12:21.171
OH!

12:21.171 --> 12:24.244
WOW. HONEY, THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.018
BREE!

12:28.018 --> 12:29.419
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

12:29.419 --> 12:32.352
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
CATERING A WEDDING.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.485
YES, CLEARLY THIS IS MY FAULT.
 AH.

12:35.485 --> 12:38.128
COURTNEY?
 I'M SO SORRY, BREE.

12:38.128 --> 12:40.530
REALLY, KARL,
MY YOGA INSTRUCTOR?

12:40.530 --> 12:42.492
NO CHARGE FOR NEXT MONTH,
OKAY?

12:42.492 --> 12:44.764
LIKE I'M KEEPING YOU!

12:44.764 --> 12:47.337
(whispers) GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY HOUSE.
 SHE--SHE'S GOING.

12:47.337 --> 12:50.901
I'M NOT TALKING TO HER!

12:50.901 --> 12:53.103
HOW COULD YOU, KARL?
IN OUR OWN BED?

12:53.103 --> 12:55.275
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT WAS TACKY.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.808
I AM SO SORRY. BYE.

12:57.808 --> 12:59.149
I'LL CALL YOU.

12:59.149 --> 13:02.182
(whispers) WHAT?
 SORRY. UH, FORCE OF HABIT.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.354
(door closes)
 LOOK, THIS THING
DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN

13:04.354 --> 13:06.786
ANY MORE
THAN WE DECIDE IT DOES.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.859
YOU MADE A VOW TO ME, KARL.

13:08.859 --> 13:12.122
OH, MY GOD. WHY DID I THINK
I COULD CHANGE YOU?

13:12.122 --> 13:14.424
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD TURN ME

13:14.424 --> 13:17.427
INTO YOUR PERSONAL LAPDOG,
LIKE ORSON.
 YOU LEAVE ORSON OUT OF THIS.

13:17.427 --> 13:21.271
WHY? I HAVEN'T DONE A THING TO
YOU THAT YOU DIDN'T DO TO HIM.

13:21.271 --> 13:23.233
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

13:23.233 --> 13:25.235
THE TRUTH HURTS,
DOESN'T IT?

13:25.235 --> 13:28.008
GET OUT.

13:30.841 --> 13:33.083
(door opens)

13:33.083 --> 13:35.085
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE
TO CALL.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.347
YOU WERE
HIS EMERGENCY CONTACT.

13:37.347 --> 13:40.320
I'M JUST A LITTLE SURPRISED.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.124
ORSON AND I HADN'T SPOKEN
IN NEARLY TEN YEARS.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.127
A-ARE YOU SURE THERE WASN'T
SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS LIFE?

13:47.127 --> 13:48.828
A GIRLFRIEND MAYBE?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.130
NEVER SAW ONE.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.502
IN FACT, IN THE SEVEN YEARS
HE LIVED HERE,

13:52.502 --> 13:55.005
I NEVER SAW ANYBODY VISIT HIM
AT ALL.

13:58.168 --> 14:00.170
UM...

14:00.170 --> 14:02.973
WHERE DID YOU... FIND HIM?

14:02.973 --> 14:06.046
IN THE BED.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.048
PARAMEDICS SAID
IT WAS A HEART ATTACK.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.380
HE'D BEEN THERE TWO DAYS.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.452
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

14:12.452 --> 14:16.156
JUST LIKE THAT, YOU'RE GONE,
AND NO ONE NOTICES?

14:18.388 --> 14:20.190
(whispers) POOR ORSON.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.993
WELL,
TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:22.993 --> 14:27.567
I'LL HAVE, UH,
GOODWILL PICK UP THE REST.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.136
YOU KNOW, HE SPOKE ABOUT YOU
CONSTANTLY.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.277
(chuckles)

15:07.277 --> 15:10.210
IT WAS ALWAYS "BREE THIS,"
"BREE THAT."

15:10.210 --> 15:12.943
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
HE DIED OF...

15:12.943 --> 15:14.384
WHAT?

15:14.384 --> 15:16.316
SAY IT.

15:17.687 --> 15:20.250
LIKE HE DIED OF
A BROKEN HEART.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.060
(man) MRS. HODGE?

15:30.060 --> 15:33.233
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
YOUR HUSBAND'S OUT OF DANGER.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.936
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.109
BUT THERE WERE
SOME COMPLICATIONS.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.671
WHAT KIND OF COMPLICATIONS?

15:41.671 --> 15:43.974
THIS IS
A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT,

15:43.974 --> 15:47.317
BUT IT SEEMS THERE HAS BEEN SOME
DAMAGE TO HIS SPINAL COLUMN.

15:47.317 --> 15:50.320
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

15:50.320 --> 15:54.184
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
YOUR HUSBAND IS PARALYZED.

16:06.236 --> 16:08.538
(telephone rings)

16:08.538 --> 16:10.270
EXCUSE ME.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.003
CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT
MONA CLARKE'S CONDITION?

16:13.003 --> 16:15.305
THE DOCTORS--THEY DID EVERYTHING
THEY COULD, BUT THAT WOMAN...

16:15.305 --> 16:18.278
I MEAN,
SHE WAS HIT BY A PLANE.
 OH, MY GOD!

16:19.979 --> 16:23.553
NOW ALL WE CAN DO IS WAIT
AND HOPE THAT SHE PULLS THROUGH.

16:23.553 --> 16:25.255
PULLS THROUGH?

16:25.255 --> 16:28.218
YES. YOUR FRIEND'S A REAL
FIGHTER. SHE'S HANGING IN THERE.

16:28.218 --> 16:30.220
HOW? SHE GOT HIT BY A PLANE!

16:30.220 --> 16:32.322
THE DOCTORS
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.324
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE RELIGIOUS,

16:34.324 --> 16:36.426
BUT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO PRAY.

16:36.426 --> 16:39.329
OH, BELIEVE ME, WE WILL.

16:39.329 --> 16:42.432
DEAR GOD, PLEASE TAKE THAT
BLACKMAILING BITCH HOME NOW.

16:42.432 --> 16:44.574
A FRICKIN' PLANE HIT HER.

16:44.574 --> 16:48.278
WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE,
A SILVER BULLET?
 ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M GONNA
GO HOME, PACK UP OUR STUFF.

16:48.278 --> 16:50.280
YOU STAY HERE.
IF THEY PRY THE PROPELLER

16:50.280 --> 16:52.512
OUT OF THAT WOMAN'S MOUTH
AND SHE STARTS YAPPING,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.514
GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.348
(sighs)

16:58.348 --> 17:00.090
JUST LIKE THAT,

17:00.090 --> 17:03.353
ANGIE BOLEN BEGAN TO CONSIDER
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

17:03.353 --> 17:07.396
SHE THOUGHT OF THE DOCTORS
TRYING TO SAVE MONA

17:07.396 --> 17:11.431
AND HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE HER
TO RECOVER.

17:13.262 --> 17:16.636
THEN SHE IMAGINED MONA
WAKING UP...

17:18.208 --> 17:21.441
AND TELLING THE POLICE
EVERYTHING SHE KNEW.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.414
AND ANGIE ASKED HERSELF,

17:24.414 --> 17:28.578
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF MONA CLARKE LIVED?

17:28.578 --> 17:31.781
(door opens)

17:34.384 --> 17:38.088
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE LUNCH,
MS. DE LUCA?

17:38.088 --> 17:40.530
EGGPLANT PARM.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.532
MAYBE IT'S NOT LIKE
THE PLACE

17:42.532 --> 17:45.535
WE USED TO SEE YOU GO INTO
ON EAST 10th STREET,

17:45.535 --> 17:47.297
BUT NOT BAD.

17:47.297 --> 17:50.300
I WANT TO SEE NICK.
 HE'S A LITTLE BUSY
AT THE MOMENT.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.403
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.

17:53.403 --> 17:56.306
AS FAR AS THE BUREAU
IS CONCERNED,

17:56.306 --> 17:59.179
NICK IS A TRAITOR.
 (liquid pours)

17:59.179 --> 18:02.282
GET USED TO IT. YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA TALK TO HIM AGAIN.
 WHAT ABOUT DANNY?

18:02.282 --> 18:07.187
TYLER IS WITH YOUR MOTHER.

18:07.187 --> 18:11.121
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.
HERE'S WHAT I WANT--

18:11.121 --> 18:12.492
PATRICK LOGAN.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.603
(sniffles)

18:23.603 --> 18:26.606
YOU NEED TO BE THINKING
REAL CLEAR RIGHT NOW.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.608
WE KNOW LOGAN RAN EVERYTHING,

18:28.608 --> 18:32.582
BUT WITHOUT HIM,
IT'S ALL GONNA FALL ON YOU.

18:32.582 --> 18:34.684
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

18:34.684 --> 18:36.686
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM
SINCE THAT NIGHT.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.719
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE RUN 18 YEARS,
AND YOU AND YOUR FORMER LOVER

18:39.719 --> 18:42.392
DON'T EVEN EXCHANGE
A PHONE CALL, HUH?

18:42.392 --> 18:44.354
DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY,
AGENT PADILLA,

18:44.354 --> 18:47.257
BUT YOU GUYS WEREN'T THE ONES
I WAS RUNNING FROM.

18:47.257 --> 18:50.560
LOOK, I KNOW LOGAN.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.562
I KNOW HOW SCARY HE IS.

18:52.562 --> 18:57.337
BUT I THINK THE SITUATION
YOU'RE IN NOW IS WORSE.

18:57.337 --> 19:02.512
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW SCARY HE IS.

19:06.576 --> 19:09.148
FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES

19:09.148 --> 19:10.850
DICTATE THE PUNISHMENT
IN THIS CASE.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.323
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR LENIENCY
FROM THE COURT.

19:13.323 --> 19:15.285
THAT BEING SAID, MS. DE LUCA,

19:15.285 --> 19:18.728
YOU HAVE INDICATED THAT YOU
WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COURT.

19:18.728 --> 19:21.861
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.694
(sighs) NO ONE...

19:24.694 --> 19:27.397
WAS SUPPOSED TO GET HURT.

19:27.397 --> 19:29.399
WE JUST BELIEVED IN SOMETHING,

19:29.399 --> 19:32.402
AND WE WANTED TO MAKE
OTHER PEOPLE BELIEVE IN IT, TOO.

19:32.402 --> 19:36.376
BUT SOMEONE DID GET HURT.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.707
A MAN DIED.

19:39.609 --> 19:44.183
I READ EVERY NEWSPAPER ARTICLE
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND,

19:44.183 --> 19:45.785
ABOUT SEAN--

19:45.785 --> 19:48.288
HOW HE COACHED LITTLE LEAGUE,

19:48.288 --> 19:52.622
THAT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
CAME TO HIS FUNERAL.

19:52.622 --> 19:55.695
I NEVER LIVED IN A WORLD
LIKE THAT... (sniffles)

19:55.695 --> 19:57.897
UNTIL WE MOVED TO FAIRVIEW.

19:57.897 --> 20:02.232
I NEVER FELT LIKE
A PART OF A COMMUNITY,

20:02.232 --> 20:03.873
WHICH... (sighs)

20:03.873 --> 20:07.307
MADE IT SO MUCH CLEARER TO ME
HOW HORRIBLE IT IS

20:07.307 --> 20:10.209
THAT I BROUGHT SO MUCH PAIN
TO YOURS.

20:18.288 --> 20:20.290
PLEASE RISE FOR SENTENCING.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.722
ANGELA DE LUCA,

20:22.722 --> 20:25.725
YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED
TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT

20:25.725 --> 20:27.727
WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY
OF PAROLE.
 (gavel bangs)

20:27.727 --> 20:31.261
MARSHALS, REMAND THE PRISONER
TO CUSTODY.

20:32.762 --> 20:34.334
OH.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.240
MA?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.812
MA!

20:51.351 --> 20:53.983
SO... HOW IS SHE?

20:55.685 --> 20:57.887
I'M...

20:57.887 --> 21:00.830
I'M SO SORRY.
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.393
(sighs)

21:03.393 --> 21:05.635
I KNOW HOW UPSET
YOU MUST BE.

21:05.635 --> 21:07.637
PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY
WITH GOD

21:07.637 --> 21:09.969
BECAUSE YOUR PRAYERS
WEREN'T ANSWERED.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.303
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
HON.

21:13.303 --> 21:15.445
ME AND GOD ARE GOOD.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.792
I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.294
THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP HER
OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION.

21:35.294 --> 21:39.399
I THOUGHT THEY SAID
SHE WAS FINE.
 NO, THEY'RE JUST BEING
EXTRA CAUTIOUS. THAT'S ALL.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.571
LOOK AT HER.

21:41.571 --> 21:43.573
I FEEL BAD EVEN SAYING IT,

21:43.573 --> 21:46.336
WITH EVERYTHING'S
THAT'S HAPPENED, BUT...

21:46.336 --> 21:48.978
WE REALLY LUCKED OUT, HUH?

21:48.978 --> 21:50.980
I DON'T THINK IT WAS LUCK.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.942
I THINK IT WAS GOD.

21:52.942 --> 21:54.944
ACTUALLY, IT WAS LYNETTE.

21:54.944 --> 21:56.916
NO, LYNETTE WAS
HIS INSTRUMENT.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.318
EITHER WAY,
IT WAS A HELL OF A TUNE.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.820
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.394
I THINK GOD SAVED CELIA
BECAUSE SHE'S SPECIAL.

22:04.394 --> 22:07.096
SHE HAS A GIFT.

22:07.096 --> 22:09.459
WHAT KIND OF GIFT?

22:09.459 --> 22:11.100
I'M NOT SURE YET.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.332
BUT SHE HAS ONE.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.437
I KNOW SHE'S GONNA DO
SOMETHING AMAZING WITH HER LIFE.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.569
FINE.

22:19.569 --> 22:21.070
WHILE YOU FIGURE OUT

22:21.070 --> 22:23.072
HOW OUR DAUGHTER'S GONNA
CHANGE THE WORLD,

22:23.072 --> 22:25.074
I'M GOING TO THE CAFETERIA.

22:25.074 --> 22:27.847
SEE YOU IN A FEW.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.479
AS SHE LAY THERE,

22:29.479 --> 22:34.984
GABRIELLE BEGAN TO THINK OF
WAYS HER DAUGHTER COULD SHINE.

22:34.984 --> 22:38.458
SHE THOUGHT OF MUSIC...

22:40.460 --> 22:43.393
AND SPORTS...

22:43.393 --> 22:44.864
(thud)

22:46.135 --> 22:49.699
AND OTHER CREATIVE PASTIMES.

22:52.101 --> 22:55.575
AND BEFORE SHE DRIFTED
OFF TO SLEEP,

22:55.575 --> 22:57.577
GABRIELLE WONDERED,

22:57.577 --> 23:03.152
WHAT IF HER DAUGHTER WAS
DESTINED TO BE A GREAT ACTRESS?

23:05.114 --> 23:07.386
(man) HI.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.658
HI.

23:08.658 --> 23:11.020
CELIA SOLIS. HOW OLD ARE YOU?

23:12.962 --> 23:14.424
5. (chuckles)

23:14.424 --> 23:16.566
IT'S OUR FIRST AUDITION.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED.

23:16.566 --> 23:19.068
WELL, GREAT. SUCH A CUTIE,
JUST WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

23:19.068 --> 23:21.170
OH, SHE CAN BE CUTER.
SHOW HIM, HONEY.

23:23.072 --> 23:26.105
(laughs) GOOD GIRL.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.409
OKAY, CELIA, THIS IS A--HERE.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.712
THIS IS A COMMERCIAL
FOR OUCH AWAY! BANDAGES.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.515
STAND RIGHT THERE ON THE "T."

23:35.515 --> 23:37.517
YOU JUST GOT A BOO-BOO
ON YOUR FINGER.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.590
YOU'RE GONNA HOLD IT UP,
LOOK REAL SAD AND CRY, OKAY?

23:43.693 --> 23:45.094
AND GO.

23:46.896 --> 23:49.699
NO, NO. DON'T SMILE, HONEY.
WE NEED YOU TO CRY.

23:49.699 --> 23:52.702
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

23:54.464 --> 23:57.166
UH, OKAY. THANK YOU--
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.668
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

23:58.668 --> 24:00.940
YOU GOTTA GIVE HER
ANOTHER SHOT. PLEASE.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.514
I... I LOVE THE LOOK, BUT CAN I
BE HONEST WITH YOU, MOM?

24:04.514 --> 24:08.077
THE SIDE DISH THAT CAME
WITH MY LUNCH HAS MORE TALENT.
 WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

24:08.077 --> 24:11.150
I'M SAYING SHE'S NOT AS GOOD
AS COLESLAW. DEAL WITH IT.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.152
HEY, THAT LITTLE GIRL IS HERE
FOR A REASON.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.454
SHE IS GOING TO
INSPIRE PEOPLE,

24:15.454 --> 24:17.757
AND YOU ARE GONNA BE
PART OF THAT!

24:17.757 --> 24:19.759
ALL RIGHT. WELL, HURRY UP.

24:22.492 --> 24:24.534
(lowered voice) ALL RIGHT.

24:24.534 --> 24:27.036
HEY, I GOT YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.
CAN YOU CRY FOR MOMMY?

24:27.036 --> 24:29.238
SURE YOU CAN.

24:29.238 --> 24:32.201
WHEN THAT NICE CASTING MAN
ASKS YOU TO HOLD UP A FINGER,

24:32.201 --> 24:34.844
JUST HOLD IT UP AND CRY.
HOW EASY IS THAT?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.680
UGH.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.752
(normal voice) HELLO?

24:42.752 --> 24:44.083
WHAT?

24:44.083 --> 24:45.585
OH, MY GOD.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.117
DADDY FELL AND HURT HIMSELF.

24:48.117 --> 24:50.219
I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

24:54.263 --> 24:57.767
AND... WHEN HE FELL,

24:57.767 --> 25:01.170
HE LANDED
ON YOUR HAMSTER CAGE

25:01.170 --> 25:03.733
AND CRUSHED MR. McFUZZ.

25:03.733 --> 25:06.776
HE IS DEAD.
MR. McFUZZ IS DEAD.

25:06.776 --> 25:09.078
(whimpering)

25:09.078 --> 25:10.940
OKAY.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.514
(Celia bawling)

25:15.514 --> 25:16.946
ROLL IT.

25:16.946 --> 25:21.050
(continues bawling)

25:21.050 --> 25:24.193
GABY, I'M GOING TO TAKE CELIA
FOR AN ICE CREAM!

25:24.193 --> 25:26.726
BE BACK IN A BIT!

25:29.829 --> 25:31.160
COME ON.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.533
THE BUS FOR CAMP
LEAVES IN 20 MINUTES.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.236
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY AUDITIONS?
MOMMY'S GONNA KILL US.

25:37.236 --> 25:40.539
HEY, LET ME HANDLE MOMMY.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.273
YOU NEED A SLEEPING BAG
TO GET ICE CREAM?
 RUN!

25:51.220 --> 25:53.623
LEAVE IT. LEAVE IT! LEAVE IT!

25:53.623 --> 25:55.184
(car alarm chirps)

25:55.184 --> 25:57.556
(chirp)

25:57.556 --> 26:00.129
(chirp)

26:00.129 --> 26:01.591
(chirp)

26:01.591 --> 26:04.794
(chirp)

26:04.794 --> 26:07.797
(pants) WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING? WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

26:07.797 --> 26:10.339
NO SUMMER CAMP.
SHE'S GOT AUDITIONS.

26:10.339 --> 26:13.342
GABY, YOU HAVE GOT HER LIVING
IN THIS WEIRD LITTLE BUBBLE,

26:13.342 --> 26:17.346
AND SHE NEEDS TO BE AROUND
KIDS HER OWN AGE.
 SHE WILL BE. I'M TAKING HER
TO A CASTING CALL FOR "ANNIE."

26:17.346 --> 26:20.079
WHY CAN'T YOU SUPPORT
HER CAREER?

26:20.079 --> 26:24.814
CELIA, WILL YOU WAIT
IN THE CAR, PLEASE?

26:24.814 --> 26:26.656
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

26:29.118 --> 26:30.620
BECAUSE SHE STINKS.

26:30.620 --> 26:33.192
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS
DESTINED FOR GREATNESS.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.194
THAT IS WHY GOD SAVED HER.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.927
GOD DOES NOT SAVE PEOPLE
WHO STINK.

26:37.927 --> 26:40.930
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE GOD SAVED HER
SO THAT SHE COULD GO TO CAMP

26:40.930 --> 26:43.332
AND MAKE SOME FRIENDS
AND HAVE A NORMAL CHILDHOOD!

26:43.332 --> 26:45.905
WHO WOULD BELIEVE
IN A GOD LIKE THAT?

26:45.905 --> 26:47.306
GABY, SHE'S MISERABLE.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.378
NO, SHE'S NOT.
SHE WANTS THIS.

26:49.378 --> 26:51.610
NO, SHE DOES IT
TO PLEASE YOU!

26:51.610 --> 26:53.612
THAT IS A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.614
I AM NOT HURTING HER.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.117
IN FACT, MAKING HER SHINE
IS MY LIFE'S WORK.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.651
ALL I WANT IS FOR PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND HOW SPECIAL SHE IS.

27:01.651 --> 27:04.353
CELIA, GET IN THE HOUSE!
 CELIA, WAIT.

27:04.353 --> 27:06.926
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU HAVE
CLEARLY LOST YOUR MIND,

27:06.926 --> 27:10.129
AND I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND WATCH YOU RUIN

27:10.129 --> 27:12.662
OUR DAUGHTER'S CHILDHOOD.
 IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, LEAVE.

27:14.363 --> 27:16.365
GABY,
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY,

27:16.365 --> 27:19.008
BECAUSE I AM VERY CLOSE
TO GOING.

27:19.008 --> 27:21.340
SEE YA. COME ON.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.372
LET'S GO GET READY
FOR YOUR AUDITION.

27:23.372 --> 27:25.274
YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE BEST ANNIE EVER.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.121
OUCH! (cries)

27:32.121 --> 27:33.753
OHH.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.225
THERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.

27:36.225 --> 27:39.228
ALL BETTER.

27:39.228 --> 27:41.160
(chuckles)
 (man) OUCH AWAY!
ADHESIVE BANDAGES...

27:41.160 --> 27:46.095
(door closes)
 THEY HEAL WITH A MOTHER'S LOVE.

27:46.095 --> 27:48.037
MAMA, NO.

27:48.037 --> 27:49.438
LOOK AT THAT FACE.

27:49.438 --> 27:51.140
THAT'S A STAR.

27:51.140 --> 27:55.044
YOU'RE NOT WATCHING
THIS AGAIN.

27:55.044 --> 27:59.779
NOW PLEASE, HELP ME
WITH THE GROCERIES.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.411
DID YOU GET MY WRINKLE CREAM?

28:02.411 --> 28:05.414
YOU CAN'T BUY STUFF LIKE THAT
WITH FOOD STAMPS.

28:05.414 --> 28:08.387
I KNOW. I JUST WISH YOU LOVED ME
ENOUGH TO STEAL IT.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.991
(telephone rings)

28:11.991 --> 28:14.363
(ring)

28:14.363 --> 28:16.265
OH.

28:16.265 --> 28:17.897
(ring)

28:17.897 --> 28:19.929
HELLO?

28:19.929 --> 28:21.470
JERRY, SWEETIE.

28:21.470 --> 28:23.773
HONEY, IT'S YOUR AGENT.

28:23.773 --> 28:25.805
OH, CELIA'S DYING TO WORK.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.237
WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR US?

28:28.237 --> 28:31.310
OH, COME ON.
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

28:31.310 --> 28:35.714
NO, NO. SHE'S NOT TOO OLD.
SHE CAN PASS FOR 15.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.487
HELL, I'M LOOKING AT HER
RIGHT NOW. OKAY, WE'LL BE THERE.

28:38.487 --> 28:41.350
BABY, WE'VE GOT AN AUDITION.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.422
AND WE GOTTA GET THAT HAIR
INTO PIGTAILS.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.724
MAMA,
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.057
WHAT DID I DO
WITH THOSE ACE BANDAGES?

28:48.057 --> 28:50.059
WE GOTTA FLATTEN YOU DOWN.

28:50.059 --> 28:53.262
LISTEN TO ME.
I DON'T WANT TO BE AN ACTRESS.

28:53.262 --> 28:55.965
WHAT? YOU CAN'T QUIT. YOU'RE...

28:55.965 --> 29:00.309
I'M SPECIAL. THIS IS MY DESTINY.
IT'S WHY I WAS SPARED.

29:00.309 --> 29:02.071
YOU SPENT THE LAST 20 YEARS

29:02.071 --> 29:04.844
TELLING ME
I'M MEANT FOR BIG THINGS.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.045
AND YOU ARE.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.376
NO.

29:07.376 --> 29:09.078
I'M NOT SPECIAL.

29:09.078 --> 29:10.249
I'M NORMAL.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.381
AND I JUST WANT TO HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE--

29:12.381 --> 29:15.754
GET MARRIED, HAVE KIDS.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.357
AND THERE'S GONNA BE
PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.429
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT.

29:20.429 --> 29:23.062
WHY CAN'T YOU ADMIT
IT'S OVER?

29:25.064 --> 29:27.366
BECAUSE IF WE GIVE UP,

29:27.366 --> 29:30.469
THEN EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR
IS FOR NOTHING.

29:32.301 --> 29:36.445
YOUR FATHER WALKED OUT.
YOUR SISTER NEVER CALLS.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.277
THIS IS ALL I HAVE.

29:42.111 --> 29:44.183
WHAT TIME'S THE AUDITION?

29:44.183 --> 29:47.216
TOMORROW, 3:00.

29:47.216 --> 29:50.389
NOW LET'S DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS HAIR.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.292
OH, HONEY, THIS IS THE ONE.
I FEEL IT.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.165
ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME.

29:59.028 --> 30:05.374
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

30:10.880 --> 30:13.342
(sighs) I BROUGHT YOU COFFEE.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.947
SO HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT OUR 4-YEAR-OLD

30:17.947 --> 30:19.949
IS GONNA DO WITH HER LIFE?

30:19.949 --> 30:23.552
NO. BUT I DID FIGURE OUT WHAT
SHE HAS TO DO TO BE SPECIAL.

30:23.552 --> 30:25.154
WHAT'S THAT?

30:29.158 --> 30:32.461
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

30:43.472 --> 30:45.544
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
I KNOW I FELL,

30:45.544 --> 30:47.516
BUT I FELT FINE AFTERWARDS.

30:47.516 --> 30:50.980
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO CAUSE
A TEAR TO THE PLACENTA.

30:50.980 --> 30:54.283
BUT YOU SAID
THE ONE BABY IS FINE?
 YES, BUT IF WE DON'T OPERATE
ON THE OTHER ONE,

30:54.283 --> 30:58.257
THERE COULD BE A DECREASE
IN BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN,

30:58.257 --> 31:01.230
WHICH COULD PUT THE CHILD
AT RISK DEVELOPMENTALLY.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.993
AT RISK HOW?
PHYSICALLY? MENTALLY?

31:03.993 --> 31:06.535
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO WAY
TO KNOW.

31:09.198 --> 31:11.300
HOW SOON CAN WE DO THE SURGERY?

31:11.300 --> 31:14.443
WE'RE READY TO GO.
LET'S GET HER IN.

31:18.347 --> 31:20.079
AT THAT MOMENT,

31:20.079 --> 31:25.184
LYNETTE BEGAN TO THINK OF
THE BABY SHE HAD YET TO MEET.

31:25.184 --> 31:30.059
SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE TO HOLD HIM,

31:30.059 --> 31:34.393
HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO LOOK
INTO HIS EYES...

31:36.325 --> 31:40.970
AND TO KISS HIS TINY HAND.

31:40.970 --> 31:45.234
AND THEN LYNETTE THOUGHT
OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

31:45.234 --> 31:49.438
IF THE DOCTOR TOLD HER
THAT SAME BEAUTIFUL CHILD

31:49.438 --> 31:51.680
WAS DISABLED.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.683
(baby crying)

31:59.488 --> 32:03.252
HE ESPECIALLY HATES
THE HAMSTRING STRETCHES.

32:03.252 --> 32:05.624
WELL, AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S HARD
TO HEAR HIM CRY,

32:05.624 --> 32:08.427
BUT YOU REALLY NEED
TO TUNE IT OUT,

32:08.427 --> 32:11.400
BECAUSE WITHOUT THE THERAPY,
HIS MUSCLE TONE WILL...

32:11.400 --> 32:14.633
YOU TRY. MAYBE IT'S ME.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.635
SOMETIMES IT HELPS
TO SING TO THEM.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.538
OH, I DO THAT.
HE LOVES IT WHEN I DO THAT.
 (baby continues crying)

32:19.538 --> 32:24.513
♪ AND THE SAILOR SAID,
"BRANDY, YOU'RE A FINE GIRL" ♪

32:24.513 --> 32:28.517
♪ "WHAT A GOOD WIFE
YOU WOULD BE" ♪

32:28.517 --> 32:30.549
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK?
 (continues crying)

32:30.549 --> 32:34.383
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME
AND TALK ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT.

32:34.383 --> 32:35.985
WHERE WE'RE AT IS

32:35.985 --> 32:39.428
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MILESTONES
SINCE AUGUST.

32:39.428 --> 32:42.161
NOT SINCE HE FINALLY STARTED
GRABBING HIS FEET.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.463
BUT THAT WAS A BIG ONE.
 DEFINITELY.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.436
BUT HE SHOULD BE SITTING
BY NOW, RIGHT?

32:47.436 --> 32:50.599
OR PULLING TO STAND
OR CRAWLING.

32:50.599 --> 32:53.602
IF YOU WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT
HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO BY NOW

32:53.602 --> 32:56.075
OR WHAT OTHER KIDS HIS AGE
ARE DOING,

32:56.075 --> 32:58.647
IT'S GONNA DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

32:58.647 --> 33:00.249
FINE.

33:00.249 --> 33:02.311
I KNOW I KEEP SAYING THIS,

33:02.311 --> 33:04.513
BUT TRY TO FOCUS
ON THE PROGRESS HE'S MAKING.

33:04.513 --> 33:06.615
LIKE WHAT?

33:06.615 --> 33:10.159
YOU'RE WITH HIM EVERY DAY.
YOU TELL ME.

33:10.159 --> 33:13.022
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

33:13.022 --> 33:16.465
(crying)

33:20.669 --> 33:24.733
WOULD YOU, UM,
EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND?

33:24.733 --> 33:26.275
IT'S OKAY.

33:26.275 --> 33:29.338
WHAT IS IT?

33:29.338 --> 33:31.680
I CAN'T DO THIS.
 CAN'T DO WHAT?

33:31.680 --> 33:34.143
THIS, HER, THE THERAPY,

33:34.143 --> 33:36.145
AND THE INJECTIONS
AND THE EQUIPMENT.

33:36.145 --> 33:39.548
AND NO ONE CAN EVEN TELL US
IF ANY OF IT IS HELPING.

33:39.548 --> 33:42.651
I THINK IT IS.
BUT EVEN IF IT ISN'T,

33:42.651 --> 33:46.525
THIS IS WHAT THERE IS TO DO,
SO WE'RE DOING IT.
 WELL, I CAN'T.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.798
NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO.
NEITHER DO I.

33:49.798 --> 33:52.501
NEITHER DOES HE. DIDN'T YOU
HEAR HIM CRYING IN THERE?

33:52.501 --> 33:54.503
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

33:54.503 --> 33:57.406
SO COME ON.
JEAN'S GOTTA GO HOME SOON.

33:57.406 --> 33:59.408
I FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING PUNISHED,

33:59.408 --> 34:01.410
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I DID.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.712
YOU CAN'T THINK THAT WAY.

34:03.712 --> 34:05.774
WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

34:05.774 --> 34:09.318
HOPES FOR THE FUTURE?
HE MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE ONE.

34:09.318 --> 34:12.380
HE'S 14 MONTHS.
DON'T WRITE HIM OFF YET!

34:14.553 --> 34:17.156
BUT YOU SHOULD START THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

34:17.156 --> 34:19.658
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT,
IT'S COMING.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.791
AND IT'S EITHER GONNA MAKE YOU
LESS AFRAID OR MORE,

34:22.791 --> 34:25.464
AND YOU WILL KNOW

34:25.464 --> 34:29.237
THAT YOU EITHER DID EVERYTHING
THAT YOU CAN FOR YOUR SON...

34:29.237 --> 34:31.300
OR YOU WILL BE SORRY.

34:37.406 --> 34:38.777
YEAH.
 (crying)

34:38.777 --> 34:40.509
THERE WE GO.

34:40.509 --> 34:43.452
(speaks indistinctly)

34:43.452 --> 34:46.215
I KNOW.
(speaks indistinctly)

34:49.158 --> 34:50.458
COME HERE.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.791
IT'S OKAY.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.523
I CAN DO THIS.

35:03.132 --> 35:06.135
(water running)

35:12.481 --> 35:14.483
HI, HONEY.

35:14.483 --> 35:16.745
CAN I HAVE A SANDWICH?

35:16.745 --> 35:18.487
UH, SURE.

35:18.487 --> 35:21.520
I JUST HAVE TO FINISH
THESE DISHES.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.553
BUT I'M HUNGRY.

35:24.553 --> 35:27.396
WELL, UNLESS YOU WANT
SOAP ON RYE,

35:27.396 --> 35:29.398
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.

35:42.271 --> 35:44.713
(dishes clatter)

35:46.375 --> 35:49.678
ACTUALLY, WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
YOURSELF A SANDWICH?

35:49.678 --> 35:53.222
BUT YOU ALWAYS DO IT.

35:53.222 --> 35:56.685
AND YOU ALWAYS WATCH ME,
SO I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW.

35:56.685 --> 35:58.727
I'M TIRED.

35:58.727 --> 36:02.731
SO AM I, AND I STILL HAVE
TO VACUUM AND DO THE LAUNDRY.

36:02.731 --> 36:05.764
MY ARMS HURT.
I HAD TO SWIM TODAY.

36:05.764 --> 36:09.398
AND YOU DO THAT
SO YOU CAN GET STRONGER,

36:09.398 --> 36:12.401
SO YOU CAN DO THINGS
LIKE MAKE SANDWICHES.

36:12.401 --> 36:15.404
SPEAKING OF WHICH, IN THE TIME
WE'VE BEEN ARGUING ABOUT THIS,

36:15.404 --> 36:16.945
YOU COULD'VE--GUESS WHAT--

36:16.945 --> 36:19.878
MADE A SANDWICH.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.610
SO COULD YOU!

36:21.610 --> 36:24.713
JASON'S MOM MAKES HIM
WHATEVER FOOD HE WANTS,

36:24.713 --> 36:27.586
EVEN FRENCH TOAST.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.589
I WOULD HAPPY TO MAKE JASON
FRENCH TOAST, TOO.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.262
HE ALWAYS TELLS ME
HOW PRETTY I AM.

36:33.262 --> 36:36.194
NOT TO MENTION,
HE'S ALSO IN A WHEELCHAIR,

36:36.194 --> 36:38.767
SO HE CAN'T REACH THE SHELVES
IN THE FRIDGE.

36:38.767 --> 36:41.470
BUT YOU CAN!

36:41.470 --> 36:44.733
TOO BAD
YOU DON'T APPRECIATE IT.

36:44.733 --> 36:46.835
YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT REALLY BUSY!

36:46.835 --> 36:49.678
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO HELP ME!

36:49.678 --> 36:52.681
YOU KNOW WHAT? ONE DAY
I WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP YOU

36:52.681 --> 36:55.684
BECAUSE I WON'T BE HERE,
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

36:55.684 --> 36:59.618
WHY I WANTED YOU TO LEARN
TO DO STUFF FOR YOURSELF!

37:01.390 --> 37:03.522
OR YOU WON'T!

37:08.226 --> 37:11.530
BUT EITHER WAY,
I'M NOT MAKING YOU A SANDWICH.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.562
(dish clatters)

37:34.583 --> 37:36.455
(clatter)

37:42.591 --> 37:44.293
(utensil clatters)

37:44.293 --> 37:46.835
(boy grunts)

37:49.938 --> 37:53.842
(clatter, cane hits floor)

37:55.544 --> 37:57.446
(plate clatters)

38:08.557 --> 38:10.389
THAT LOOKS GOOD.

38:12.491 --> 38:15.564
CAN I HAVE A BITE?

38:17.526 --> 38:19.067
(microphone feedback whines)

38:19.067 --> 38:21.970
(man) WHEN I WAS BORN,
MY DOCTOR TOLD MY PARENTS

38:21.970 --> 38:24.603
I WOULDN'T MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT,

38:24.603 --> 38:27.936
THEN THROUGH THE WEEK,

38:27.936 --> 38:30.579
THEN IT WAS THAT I WAS BLIND,

38:30.579 --> 38:32.781
THAT I'D NEED A WHEELCHAIR.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.586
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

38:37.586 --> 38:40.619
I'VE REALLY PISSED
MY DOCTORS OFF.

38:40.619 --> 38:44.453
(laughter)

38:44.453 --> 38:48.897
AT FIRST, MY MOTHER WAS SCARED--

38:48.897 --> 38:53.632
SCARED OF MY DISABILITY,

38:53.632 --> 38:56.465
MY LIMITATIONS.

38:56.465 --> 38:59.638
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME.

38:59.638 --> 39:03.071
THEN SHE REALIZED WHAT SHE WAS
REALLY SCARED OF,

39:03.071 --> 39:05.414
WAS MY POTENTIAL

39:05.414 --> 39:08.747
AND THAT SHE'S MISS SOMETHING
THAT WOULD HELP ME REACH IT.

39:10.519 --> 39:12.521
GANDHI SAID,

39:12.521 --> 39:16.084
"STRENGTH...

39:16.084 --> 39:19.688
"DOES NOT COME
FROM A PHYSICAL CAPACITY.

39:19.688 --> 39:24.092
IT COMES
FROM AN INDOMITABLE WILL."

39:24.092 --> 39:26.565
MY MOTHER'S PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD THAT SAYING...

39:26.565 --> 39:28.136
(chuckles)

39:28.136 --> 39:31.440
BUT EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE,

39:31.440 --> 39:33.672
SHE SHOWED ME HOW TRUE IT IS.

39:35.544 --> 39:38.106
NOW I...

39:38.106 --> 39:41.610
I HOPE I CAN START SHOWING HER.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.155
THANK YOU.

39:49.518 --> 39:51.520
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

39:59.167 --> 40:05.534
(inhales and exhales deeply)

40:07.405 --> 40:09.037
HOW'S OUR BABY?

40:09.037 --> 40:10.939
IS HE OKAY?

40:12.581 --> 40:16.414
LYNETTE...

40:20.018 --> 40:21.850
WE LOST THE BABY.

40:24.893 --> 40:26.925
BUT...

40:26.925 --> 40:30.699
THE OTHER BABY
IS FINE.

40:32.661 --> 40:35.664
IT'S OKAY.

40:35.664 --> 40:39.007
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

41:20.148 --> 41:23.151
(voice breaks) I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THANK YOU

41:23.151 --> 41:26.084
FOR SAVING MY CHILD'S LIFE...

41:26.084 --> 41:29.658
AND HOW SORRY I AM FOR...

41:34.763 --> 41:37.966
WE WERE GONNA
NAME HIM PATRICK.

41:37.966 --> 41:39.628
(sighs)

41:42.230 --> 41:44.533
(whispers)
AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN...

41:44.533 --> 41:47.736
AMAZING.

41:53.982 --> 41:58.516
THE FUNERAL FOR KARL MAYER
WAS A DIGNIFIED AFFAIR

41:58.516 --> 42:02.591
ATTENDED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY

42:02.591 --> 42:05.894
AND THOSE WHO LOVED HIM.

42:05.894 --> 42:09.628
THE PRIEST SPOKE ABOUT
THE NATURE OF TRAGEDY,

42:09.628 --> 42:14.302
HOW IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO ASK
"WHAT IF?"

42:14.302 --> 42:18.136
"WHAT IF HE HADN'T DIED?"

42:18.136 --> 42:22.170
"WHAT IF I HAD CHOSEN
DIFFERENTLY?"

42:22.170 --> 42:26.845
"WHAT IF I HAD MADE
THAT MISTAKE?"

42:26.845 --> 42:30.048
AND THEN THE PRIEST SAID

42:30.048 --> 42:33.121
THE BEST WAY TO HONOR
THOSE WHO HAD DIED

42:33.121 --> 42:36.625
WAS TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS

42:36.625 --> 42:42.330
AND TO KEEP ON LIVING
THE BEST WAY WE KNOW HOW.

42:42.330 --> 42:44.092
AND IN TIME,

42:44.092 --> 42:48.667
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MY FRIENDS
WOULD DO.
