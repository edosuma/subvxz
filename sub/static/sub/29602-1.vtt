(leaves rustling)

00:09.243 --> 00:12.044
(wind howling)

00:14.749 --> 00:17.616
(ominous music)

00:39.273 --> 00:42.674
(horse hooves clacking)

00:46.714 --> 00:49.581
(ominous music)

01:08.335 --> 01:11.103
(wind howling)

01:15.443 --> 01:18.243
(somber music)

01:22.483 --> 01:25.417
(radio clicking)

01:35.663 --> 01:37.897
- [Man] Yes?

01:37.898 --> 01:40.132
(muffled phone speaking)

01:40.134 --> 01:42.401
Are you certain?

01:42.402 --> 01:44.669
- [Man On Phone] Of course I'm
certain!

01:44.672 --> 01:47.539
(ominous music)

01:59.186 --> 02:01.787
(somber music)

02:03.424 --> 02:06.658
(footsteps thumping)

02:10.131 --> 02:13.332
(door lock clicking)

02:18.439 --> 02:23.575
- Papa?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.280
Papa?

02:29.850 --> 02:32.618
(doorknob rattling)

02:32.620 --> 02:34.887
No, no, no, no.

02:34.889 --> 02:36.488
Papa, no!

02:36.490 --> 02:39.358
(ominous music)

02:43.631 --> 02:44.897
- Excuse me, Jamieson, sir?

02:44.899 --> 02:45.764
Pardon me.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.666
- Yes?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.567
- Dr. Pearrow is waiting
to speak with you outside.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.303
- Dr. Pearrow?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.238
Now?

02:52.239 --> 02:53.172
- Yes, out front.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.509
- Thank you.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.750
(ominous music)

03:07.688 --> 03:09.004
Good evening, sir.

03:09.005 --> 03:10.321
- [Pearrow] Remove your gloves.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.457
- [Jamieson] Excuse me?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.193
- Take off your gloves.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.265
(eerie music)

03:22.203 --> 03:24.703
It's humiliating enough
that my daughter was seen

03:24.705 --> 03:27.272
sneaking around town with a
married man

03:27.841 --> 03:30.309
but to think that she was
gonna board a train tonight

03:30.311 --> 03:31.877
with someone of your hobby.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.112
- Sir.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.346
- She is my daughter!

03:35.716 --> 03:39.218
I swear to God, if you
weren't the only reason

03:39.220 --> 03:40.852
that my seats are full in my
opera house,

03:40.854 --> 03:42.487
I would kill you right here.

03:43.290 --> 03:47.359
Tonight will be your
last night on my stage!

03:47.995 --> 03:50.295
After that there won't be a
worthy stage

03:50.297 --> 03:53.498
or a concerned father either
side of the Mississippi

03:53.500 --> 03:55.634
that doesn't know of your
defilement!

03:56.870 --> 03:59.771
(train horn blowing)

03:59.773 --> 04:00.806
If I was you,

04:02.476 --> 04:04.910
I would catch that late train
tonight...

04:05.913 --> 04:06.912
Alone.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.253
Yah!

04:22.596 --> 04:26.999
(opera singing in foreign
language)

04:38.912 --> 04:41.780
(ominous music)

04:43.984 --> 04:46.551
(groaning)

04:51.425 --> 04:55.827
(opera singing in foreign
language)

05:00.501 --> 05:03.435
(audience applauding)

05:03.437 --> 05:05.971
(eerie music)

05:13.914 --> 05:16.982
(foreboding music)

05:26.860 --> 05:30.329
(audience applauding)

05:47.481 --> 05:50.549
(street commotion)

06:09.103 --> 06:11.903
(somber music)

06:26.420 --> 06:29.087
(steam hissing)

06:42.436 --> 06:44.403
(clattering)

06:44.405 --> 06:45.604
- [Woman] Oh.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.506
- Allye.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.807
- I'm so sorry.

06:49.843 --> 06:50.842
I'm so sorry.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.779
- Your father, he said I have
to--

06:53.781 --> 06:55.046
- He's a fool.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.785
You were leaving without me.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.921
- I had no choice.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.557
He knows.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.728
- Nobody can mind their
own business in this town.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.132
Hey.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.068
It's me.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.805
It's us.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.141
It's everything we dreamed
about.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.110
Okay?

07:27.614 --> 07:28.747
- Of course.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.184
Of course.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.721
(gunshot booming)

07:41.061 --> 07:43.995
(dramatic music)

07:45.799 --> 07:46.731
- No, no.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.066
No, no.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.670
(train whistle blowing)

07:54.708 --> 07:56.641
No, no, no, wait, no.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.778
We have to go, please, please.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.747
(dramatic music)

08:18.165 --> 08:21.633
(train steam hissing)

08:27.774 --> 08:30.675
(train chugging)

08:36.616 --> 08:38.783
(crying)

08:45.993 --> 08:48.527
(groaning)

08:49.062 --> 08:51.997
(dramatic music)

08:57.204 --> 08:59.671
(sobbing)

09:05.946 --> 09:08.213
(huffing)

09:11.084 --> 09:13.318
(crying)

09:23.330 --> 09:26.264
(dramatic music)

09:46.887 --> 09:49.821
(birds chirping)

09:58.332 --> 10:00.999
(somber music)

10:01.001 --> 10:04.002
(hooves clacking)

10:20.153 --> 10:23.021
(door thudding)

10:30.664 --> 10:32.797
- How many have entrance to the
theater?

10:35.769 --> 10:37.636
- Only the two keys.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.039
- Change the locks today.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.712
- [Man] The entire engagement
will end

10:47.714 --> 10:49.180
two weeks from tomorrow.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.683
The first week's only dress
rehearsals

10:51.684 --> 10:54.185
but I think it'll still spark
interest among the public.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.388
The theater itself, however,
will remain off limits

10:56.390 --> 10:58.223
until the evening performances.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.726
Nickelodeons and side
shows will be situated

11:01.728 --> 11:04.062
along a street generating
completely separate earnings

11:04.064 --> 11:05.764
from the seat sales.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.099
- How many fixtures are
not currently in use?

11:10.671 --> 11:12.704
- They're all in use, sir.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.072
- Make sure that a bulb is
burning

11:14.074 --> 11:15.740
in the house whenever vacant.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.213
- May I inquire to the request,
sir?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.682
- Safety reasons.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.749
- About the electricity.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.151
- No matter the cost.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.055
- Sorry to interrupt.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.022
- You did.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.193
- Sir?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.895
- You interrupted.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.366
- August, knock before entering.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.834
- Of course.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.269
I sincerely apologize, sir.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.341
- What is it?

11:52.412 --> 11:53.478
- They've arrived.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.316
(somber music)

12:04.124 --> 12:07.058
(horse neighing)

12:13.400 --> 12:15.200
- Ah, this will do.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.554
- Good day, Mr. Grimes.

12:19.555 --> 12:22.206
The company looks just like the
flyers we've been receiving.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.275
- That's because we've
been the one sending them.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.078
- We're so glad to
finally play host to you.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.280
This is our proud owner and
world-renowned physician,

12:29.282 --> 12:30.982
Dr. Willard L. Pearrow.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.419
- A fine town, it seems, Doctor,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.287
and a quant venue.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.356
We shouldn't have trouble
filling your seats.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.425
- That's why you've been brought
here.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.629
- In my experience,

12:43.630 --> 12:45.497
fine theater doesn't put
asses in seats anymore

12:45.499 --> 12:48.032
but don't worry, behind me,
here, is the

12:48.034 --> 12:50.001
finest vaudeville in the east.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.903
And our main attraction, well,

12:51.905 --> 12:53.905
we'll have even the gentlemen

12:53.907 --> 12:56.007
running to check their
undergarments.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.777
- Same two-bit thrills under a
new vail.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.081
- Well the days of the
three act are dying, Doctor.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.849
People need entertainment.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.384
Whatever will remove them

13:06.385 --> 13:07.918
from the wretched lives they're
living.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.355
Instead of two parts, I deliver
an eight.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.491
Four acts with an intermission
followed by another four.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.927
The first three dumb acts
will captivate the audience

13:15.929 --> 13:17.862
before we hit them with a strong
act

13:17.864 --> 13:19.264
heading into intermission.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.232
Our lovely ladies will pull us
back in

13:21.234 --> 13:22.967
before we introduce our main
attraction,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.387
as I was saying before,

13:25.388 --> 13:27.806
in an experience like no
other company in the wold!

13:28.408 --> 13:32.410
That, alone, makes our fee
well worth it, I assure you.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.183
- Well, you have a limited
engagement, as discussed.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.852
- Well then, no need to
waste any time, is there?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.556
If you please,

13:45.358 --> 13:47.358
I prefer to load in the rear.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.095
- It'll be my pleasure.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.063
Jack.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.965
- Oh,

13:53.967 --> 13:57.235
I'm certain my correspondence
was with August.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.539
- I'll unlatch the doors, sir.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.177
- It's gonna be a fantastic
show, Doctor.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.250
(somber music)

14:36.476 --> 14:39.410
(chair creaking)

14:40.313 --> 14:42.547
- I trust this isn't your
main attraction, Mr. Grimes.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.583
- Miss Rosa is one of our dumb
acts.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.325
- He means silent.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.028
- Ah.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.398
Please forgive our
inexperience, Mr. Grimes,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.367
we've never played host
to a vaudeville show.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.451
Only opera.

15:03.452 --> 15:04.534
- Wonderful, dear.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.404
(clapping)

15:06.406 --> 15:07.472
Thank you.

15:07.474 --> 15:12.210
Gentlemen, I've developed a
way to fulfill the human desire

15:12.212 --> 15:15.046
for riveting sacrifice.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.548
Thanks to my latest, if you
please.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.456
(gunshot booming)
- [Jack] Oh!

15:25.458 --> 15:26.624
Holy Christ!

15:27.928 --> 15:30.028
- What is going on here?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.062
Explain yourself.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.102
(somber music)

15:39.406 --> 15:41.339
- Dear gracious Lord.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.143
- What we have here is one
step closer to bridging the gap

15:45.145 --> 15:47.979
between make believe and
reality.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.416
My guess is you'll fancy
at this trick, Doctor.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.022
A simple physician's bulb
with reusable rubber tubing

15:58.024 --> 16:01.192
attached to a tiny bubble
of animal intestine.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.094
Run the tube to the chest and/or
stomach,

16:03.096 --> 16:05.230
anywhere you like, really,

16:05.231 --> 16:07.365
fill the device with whatever
animal blood you can spare

16:07.367 --> 16:09.167
and at the sound of a gunfire,

16:10.337 --> 16:11.336
voilÃ .

16:12.706 --> 16:15.006
(laughing)
(clapping)

16:15.008 --> 16:16.975
- Well done, Mr. Grimes.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.577
It' like witnessing an actual
killing.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.379
- See, unlike our doctor, here,

16:21.381 --> 16:23.281
who has seen this before
in your profession,

16:23.283 --> 16:28.419
we have never experienced a
truly convincing death on stage.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.523
There's something about seeing
the blood run from the wound

16:32.525 --> 16:34.392
that makes it sincere.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.227
No shame, no guilt,

16:36.229 --> 16:38.596
in seeing something
you otherwise wouldn't.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.499
Because you can simply walk
out of those theater doors

16:42.435 --> 16:44.268
and go back to your normal life.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.406
- Indeed.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.408
Well done.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.745
Jack will accommodate what you
need.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.546
- Looking forward to it, Doctor.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.837
- Do not forget,

17:02.838 --> 17:04.521
you are not to be
backstage during the shows.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.391
You are to purchase a
ticket like the rest.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.559
- Yes, sir, of course.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.428
- Sidewalks need sweeping.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.705
(somber music)

17:26.179 --> 17:28.780
(bell ringing)

18:08.521 --> 18:11.355
(somber music)

18:24.304 --> 18:27.438
(crickets chirping)

18:32.378 --> 18:35.613
(gentle tempo music)

19:22.662 --> 19:25.530
(ominous music)

19:44.717 --> 19:47.585
(wood creaking)

19:48.388 --> 19:49.253
(thudding)

19:49.255 --> 19:51.689
(groaning)

19:51.691 --> 19:54.892
(footsteps thumping)

19:55.962 --> 19:58.829
(ominous music)

20:03.736 --> 20:06.504
(bell ringing)

20:10.777 --> 20:13.844
(foreboding music)

20:15.548 --> 20:17.682
- What the hell are you doing
back here?

20:22.889 --> 20:26.290
You're supposed to be in the
opera house.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.427
(crickets chirping)

20:33.700 --> 20:36.434
(eerie music)

20:40.540 --> 20:42.023
Are you gonna tell me now

20:42.024 --> 20:43.507
what I have to do to get rid of
you?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.612
(ominous music)

21:18.511 --> 21:21.379
(Allye huffing)

21:29.355 --> 21:31.289
- What are you doing?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.392
What are you doing?

21:35.028 --> 21:36.627
Why did you come back here?

21:43.703 --> 21:46.537
(somber music)

21:58.918 --> 22:00.985
- [Grimes] These are not sets to
be moved

22:00.987 --> 22:03.621
in and out like an opera, Mr.
Jack.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.657
- Yes, sir, and I completely
understand what you're saying.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.009
- Well, I'll say it again.

22:08.010 --> 22:09.360
We have over a half dozen acts.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.595
Our sets must be flown in an out
quickly.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.714
We do not have the manpower,

22:13.715 --> 22:15.832
nor do you have the wing
space to house props.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.702
- Let alone, if the trestles
will hold the weight,

22:17.704 --> 22:20.355
we've never done this sort of
thing.

22:20.356 --> 22:23.007
- I was assured we'd be properly
outfitted with this venue,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.475
Mr. Jack.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.077
- Trestles will hold fine.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.962
It's reinforced steal.

22:27.963 --> 22:29.846
Molded myself to withstand
winds from a tornado,

22:29.849 --> 22:32.083
same with every other
building on Main Street.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.484
- You did, aye?

22:34.587 --> 22:35.986
- Only blacksmith in town.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.089
- Doubling as a stagehand?

22:38.091 --> 22:40.658
- August came to use shortly
after our doors opened.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.361
It's nice to have someone on the
inside

22:43.363 --> 22:45.496
who helped with construction to
build it.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.098
- Very well.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.699
Good to have someone educated
around.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.773
- August, we agreed
I'd be kept up to speed

22:55.775 --> 22:56.774
with all the details.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.092
- I know, I'm sorry.

22:58.093 --> 22:59.409
- Pearrow would read me the Riot
Act

22:59.410 --> 23:00.726
if there's even the
slightest hitch in this show.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.043
- Of course, I know, and I'm
sorry.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.914
I'll be more thorough, I
promise.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.149
- I trust you, August.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.051
It's gonna be great.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.816
- I'd like to honor the man

23:21.817 --> 23:23.834
who puts this town on the world
map.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.504
His contributions make our town
soon to be

23:26.506 --> 23:29.106
one of the greatest in the
world.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.841
Doctor, to your most recent
blessing,

23:30.843 --> 23:32.977
the electrifying of the
courthouse,

23:32.979 --> 23:34.912
without your kind and generous
heart

23:34.914 --> 23:37.615
we would be a lessor society.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.582
Truly.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.002
- Where there is potential,

23:41.003 --> 23:43.421
no amount of money can
surmount the reward.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.189
Now, if we could just rid the
town

23:45.191 --> 23:47.091
of the filth that still lingers.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.092
(laughing)

23:48.094 --> 23:49.093
- To Dr. Pearrow.

23:52.832 --> 23:53.964
- So, Doctor,

23:53.966 --> 23:57.668
I think what we are all
interested to hear about

23:57.670 --> 24:01.071
is the new event taking place
at theater this weekend.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.175
- Yes, the show.

24:04.177 --> 24:06.010
- It's been stirring quite a
buzz

24:06.012 --> 24:08.413
amongst the merchants downtown.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.815
More enthusiasm than
uncertainty, I assure you,

24:10.817 --> 24:12.583
but a bit of both.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.219
- Well, it will be a fine show.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.489
Things unseen

24:19.192 --> 24:21.459
by anyone here before.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.128
It's the latest rage in
the theater back east.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.097
- Word is the main attraction is
the likes

24:27.099 --> 24:28.966
of a superhuman being.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.802
They say he can bend
steel with his bare hands.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.604
Even take a cannon ball to the
stomach

24:33.606 --> 24:35.606
with little more than a flinch.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.607
Have you seen it?

24:36.608 --> 24:37.607
- I heard the same.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.779
- Well, you'll just have
to come and see the show.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.447
(chuckling)

24:43.448 --> 24:45.114
- Seats will be reserved
to members only, I hope.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.084
I mean, I hate to take
Grace to market anymore,

24:47.086 --> 24:49.753
what, with all the people
around.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.189
You know, diseases.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.692
- Well, of course our
seats will be reserved.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.660
It's no different than
a night at the opera,

24:56.662 --> 24:58.195
right, Doctor?

24:58.197 --> 25:00.731
- I think it'll be a fantastic
evening.

25:00.733 --> 25:01.999
I've always wondered what it'd
be like

25:02.001 --> 25:03.767
to attend a variety show.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.237
- It's not a variety show.

25:06.239 --> 25:10.941
It's high end vaudeville,
it's quite different.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.560
- Indeed.

25:12.561 --> 25:14.178
- And I assure you, the
audience will be divided

25:14.180 --> 25:15.813
in their respected places.

25:15.815 --> 25:21.785
The theater always feels
best when her seats are full.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.021
- As do your pockets, aye,
Willard?

25:24.023 --> 25:25.606
(laughing)

25:25.607 --> 25:27.190
Well, it is rightful
time to see the theater

25:27.193 --> 25:29.793
operating again, regardless of
method.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.830
Will it be lamb today, dear?

25:32.832 --> 25:36.000
- I think I'd like to try
something a bit less fatty.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.836
Do you think they have quail
like we had in Little Rock?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.671
(thudding)
Ow!

25:40.673 --> 25:43.807
(ominous music)

25:43.809 --> 25:44.909
- Dear,

25:44.911 --> 25:46.911
that was Allye's meal.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.254
(eerie music)

26:05.097 --> 26:08.032
- Since when was the
club open to nonmembers?

26:08.034 --> 26:11.101
- My apologies, sir, but
it is only open to members.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.037
- Hmmm.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.809
(ominous music)

26:25.251 --> 26:28.185
(fire crackling)

26:38.264 --> 26:41.599
(people chattering)

26:54.747 --> 26:56.947
- No, sir, not on the bottom
floor.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.882
Your seats are on the balcony.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.818
You are not allowed to stand
here.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.287
- But I was told--
- Front of the balcony, sir.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.990
These are for members only.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.259
(ominous tempo music)

27:14.767 --> 27:17.735
(fire whooshing)

27:19.939 --> 27:23.073
(crickets chirping)

27:29.081 --> 27:31.649
(laughing)

27:32.752 --> 27:35.085
(laughing)

27:36.055 --> 27:38.756
(applauding)

27:44.196 --> 27:46.964
(somber music)

28:07.687 --> 28:10.020
(laughing)

28:15.227 --> 28:16.827
(gagging)

28:16.829 --> 28:19.096
(laughing)

28:19.098 --> 28:21.965
(crickets chirping)

28:21.967 --> 28:23.200
- [Grimes] Com on!

28:23.202 --> 28:24.735
Move, let's go!

28:26.906 --> 28:27.871
Go get Lillian.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.139
- Yes.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.774
Lily's on right now.

28:30.776 --> 28:32.109
- Go get someone then!

28:34.346 --> 28:36.013
Sit down.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.449
(somber music)

28:38.451 --> 28:41.118
(gasping)

28:41.120 --> 28:43.320
(gunshot booming)

28:43.322 --> 28:46.390
(crowd applauding)

28:52.832 --> 28:55.399
(somber music)

29:00.840 --> 29:02.272
- [Grimes] What's wrong with
you?

29:05.411 --> 29:06.977
- Everything okay, Mr. Grimes?

29:06.979 --> 29:08.312
- Uh...

29:08.314 --> 29:09.413
Uh, well...

29:10.449 --> 29:12.382
No, no, no, it isn't.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.957
Our headliner has injured
himself.

29:23.796 --> 29:24.795
- This is him.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.169
What happened, exactly?

29:32.171 --> 29:34.338
- This genius

29:34.340 --> 29:36.540
thought it wise to assist in
moving sets

29:36.542 --> 29:38.342
right before his own damn
performance!

29:38.344 --> 29:40.544
- If you hired stage hands that
could lift

29:40.546 --> 29:42.312
more than a bag of flower--
- Shut up! Shut up!

29:42.314 --> 29:44.048
- [August] Is he still able to
go on?

29:44.049 --> 29:45.783
- Not if we don't get it
back in place quickly, no.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.618
- What happened?

29:47.619 --> 29:49.452
- He's an ignorant fool is what
happened!

29:49.455 --> 29:50.854
- [Strong Man] Dislocated again,
Lily.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.189
- Move back, please.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.894
It's going to hurt.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.895
- I know.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.065
(yelling)

30:02.067 --> 30:02.966
- Come on!

30:02.968 --> 30:04.067
Harder!

30:04.069 --> 30:05.335
- Has anyone have a gag?

30:06.405 --> 30:08.172
- Yeah, I've got a...

30:13.412 --> 30:16.413
(muffled yelling)

30:17.550 --> 30:19.383
- I'm not going to be able to do
it.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.384
- Damn it!

30:21.954 --> 30:23.921
We need an actual doctor.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.056
- I know set a dislocation.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.324
It just won't take.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.026
- Where is Dr. Pearrow?

30:29.027 --> 30:29.960
- No.
- No.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.000
- You don't want him to know
about this.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.102
- If we don't pop it back
in place like normal,

30:39.104 --> 30:40.971
something is more seriously
wrong

30:40.973 --> 30:43.240
and then we don't have a goddamn
show!

30:45.845 --> 30:47.110
- I'll try to find Jack.

30:54.119 --> 30:57.254
(people chattering)

31:01.861 --> 31:04.545
(clear throat)

31:04.546 --> 31:07.230
- We wanna thank you all again
for joining us this evening.

31:07.233 --> 31:10.267
Please come back tomorrow
night for a replay of the show

31:10.269 --> 31:14.271
and the vigorous presentation of
our main

31:14.273 --> 31:15.339
event!

31:15.341 --> 31:16.206
- [Man] Come on!

31:16.208 --> 31:17.541
What is this?

31:17.543 --> 31:20.344
(crowd booing)

31:27.119 --> 31:30.254
(crickets chirping)

31:31.590 --> 31:34.391
(somber music)

31:36.462 --> 31:37.461
- Hey, Lily.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.964
How do you always know what to
do?

31:42.935 --> 31:44.301
- My father was a doctor.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.039
- You must've made him proud.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.677
- Just keep it as still
as you can until morning.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.480
(somber music)

32:07.192 --> 32:09.927
(laughing)

32:09.929 --> 32:12.663
(dramatic music)

32:50.502 --> 32:53.370
(door clicking)

32:57.409 --> 33:00.277
(ominous music)

33:20.499 --> 33:22.766
(sighing)

33:29.508 --> 33:30.507
Hey!

33:39.685 --> 33:42.419
(eerie music)

33:46.358 --> 33:47.758
Reveal yourself.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.239
(thudding)

34:08.213 --> 34:10.547
(thudding)

34:14.820 --> 34:15.819
Remove it.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.326
Take it off!

34:24.797 --> 34:27.664
(ominous music)

34:38.643 --> 34:39.643
You?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.713
- How did you get into the
theater?

34:45.384 --> 34:46.567
- What on Earth are you doing?

34:46.568 --> 34:47.751
What is this about?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.455
- I have a thing for stage.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.389
- Don't play with me, I
saw you, I saw you at...

34:54.693 --> 34:57.394
I've seen you around here
before in that costume.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.098
- I saw you too.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.768
- I don't know what you mean.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.672
- It was certainly a surprise.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.776
But I was confident that
I recognized your face.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.145
As anybody from here would.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.849
And again, when I saw you here.

35:21.386 --> 35:23.386
The phony accent isn't
enough to distract from that.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.504
(gun clicking)

35:24.505 --> 35:25.621
- I'll only ask once more,

35:27.392 --> 35:29.426
what are you doing with Dr.
Pearrow?

35:34.266 --> 35:35.732
- I can't tell you that.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.634
- You don't have much of a
choice!

35:44.376 --> 35:47.277
If you so much as breathe a word
of this,

35:48.480 --> 35:50.180
don't approach me.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.815
Don't even look in my direction.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.452
Do you understand?

35:59.691 --> 36:02.526
(somber music)

36:08.233 --> 36:09.232
- Wait.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.304
I have no idea your
intention's worth turning.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.806
And to be honest, I'm not
sure I want the answer.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.943
But your secret will die with
me.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.747
I need to know mine will do the
same.

36:27.252 --> 36:29.853
(somber music)

36:31.323 --> 36:32.322
Lily?

36:35.727 --> 36:38.562
(gun clicking)

36:45.604 --> 36:48.471
(ominous music)

36:50.809 --> 36:53.944
(crickets chirping)

37:16.235 --> 37:17.901
(sinister music)

37:17.903 --> 37:19.236
- How are you today?

37:19.871 --> 37:21.805
- I'm sorry?

37:21.806 --> 37:23.740
- Are you feeling well enough to
perform?

37:23.742 --> 37:24.741
- Of course.

37:27.646 --> 37:31.715
- Are you all feeling well
enough to do your jobs today?

37:33.452 --> 37:35.619
Hmmm?

37:35.620 --> 37:37.787
My clinic was at full capacity
this morning when I arrived

37:37.789 --> 37:39.823
and I thought it to be a good
day.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.759
Yet, not a single one of them
was waiting for medicine, no!

37:42.761 --> 37:45.629
One by one, they inquired about
a refund

37:45.631 --> 37:47.397
from last evening's show.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.733
Because of some unexplained
reason

37:50.736 --> 37:52.602
the one performance they came to
see,

37:52.604 --> 37:55.272
which has been posted all over
town,

37:55.274 --> 37:57.807
the most shocking human being
alive,

37:57.809 --> 37:59.776
decided to stay home!

38:01.580 --> 38:04.047
Why wasn't I informed
of this immediately?!

38:04.049 --> 38:04.914
Huh?!

38:04.916 --> 38:06.349
Why?!

38:06.350 --> 38:07.783
- You see, Doctor,

38:08.687 --> 38:12.889
unfortunate circumstances
sometimes do arise.

38:12.891 --> 38:16.660
Especially given our profile of
risk.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.561
- We tried you numerous
times by wire, sir,

38:18.563 --> 38:20.330
but we were never able to reach
you.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.065
- I was indisposed.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.566
- Had we reached you,
we may have been able

38:23.568 --> 38:25.035
to continue the show in time

38:25.771 --> 38:27.904
or today, at the latest.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.541
It was, in fact, a medical
emergency.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.576
- Show me!

38:37.983 --> 38:38.982
You stay.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.988
(quivering)

38:59.071 --> 39:01.805
I must be asleep and dreaming

39:01.806 --> 39:04.540
if you think I'm more fool
enough to put a negro on my
stage

39:04.543 --> 39:06.226
as a main attraction.

39:06.227 --> 39:07.910
Sir, you are thicker than I
first thought!

39:07.913 --> 39:10.080
- Negros are not new to the
stage.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.881
- Not here, not on this stage!

39:12.617 --> 39:15.118
This is not a goddamn circus!

39:15.120 --> 39:18.088
This is an acclaimed opera
house!

39:18.090 --> 39:20.857
Not grounds for your
experiments.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.559
How could you have allowed this?

39:22.561 --> 39:24.661
- Mr. Grimes never made
me aware he was colored.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.931
- This is the strongest human
being

39:27.933 --> 39:29.666
these people have ever
witnessed, okay?

39:29.668 --> 39:32.469
One they'll pay good money to
see.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.472
- And now he's gone and hurt
himself?

39:35.474 --> 39:37.640
- He's dislodged joints before

39:37.642 --> 39:39.042
but we can't seem to get
this one back in place.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.945
I'm afraid, this time it's more
serious.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.930
(chuckling)

39:43.931 --> 39:45.914
- And now you're in need
of my medical expertise.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.650
- If Dr. Pearrow fixes,

39:47.652 --> 39:49.575
fixes his arm,

39:49.576 --> 39:51.499
will he be well enough
to perform tomorrow?

39:51.500 --> 39:53.423
- A day's recovery at the very
least.

39:53.425 --> 39:54.657
You know that, Doctor.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.060
- Unbelievable.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.667
Drop your hand, sir.

40:10.976 --> 40:15.812
(cracking)
(screaming)

40:21.686 --> 40:23.553
You will not be paid for this
evening

40:23.555 --> 40:25.055
or last night's performance.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.556
- That was not our agreement,
Doctor.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.158
It states clearly in the
contract

40:28.160 --> 40:29.826
that acts of God may happen.

40:29.828 --> 40:32.695
- Please, oh please, threaten
me.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.831
We both know good and well

40:34.833 --> 40:36.800
that you couldn't feed
your horses or your clowns

40:36.802 --> 40:37.967
without my pocket!

40:37.969 --> 40:42.071
The only act of God will be you
recovering

40:42.073 --> 40:44.808
from being thrown out of
my acclaimed opera house!

40:55.187 --> 40:58.121
(birds chirping)

41:02.494 --> 41:04.761
(gasping)

41:24.082 --> 41:25.949
- Just inhale.

41:25.951 --> 41:26.950
Deep.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.187
(coughing)

41:31.189 --> 41:33.089
There you go.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.090
Slower.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.897
(sighing)

41:41.900 --> 41:44.267
There you go.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.636
(somber music)

41:46.638 --> 41:48.037
- A cigar?

41:50.775 --> 41:52.675
- Wish I could take credit
myself.

41:54.946 --> 41:55.979
From your father.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.552
- Thank you.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.220
It's the least I could do.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.722
- For keeping your word.

42:08.260 --> 42:09.259
- Likewise.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.065
You're a household name here.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.201
Mothers and fathers use you as
an example

42:18.203 --> 42:19.669
for their children now.

42:21.806 --> 42:24.607
- Only to them, I'm rotting
in the ground somewhere

42:25.210 --> 42:27.210
while my father walks around as
the hero

42:27.212 --> 42:28.778
who murdered my assailant.

42:33.818 --> 42:36.119
Two years and never finding my
body.

42:37.656 --> 42:39.122
Why has no one questioned it?

42:40.258 --> 42:42.559
- It's a matter of who
they're questioning.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.611
It's your father.

42:44.612 --> 42:46.662
Half this town wouldn't
exist if it wasn't for him.

42:52.938 --> 42:55.305
There's many rumors as
to why you were killed.

43:00.979 --> 43:01.900
But I have to say, I'm more
interested in

43:01.901 --> 43:02.822
what prompted him to pull the
trigger.

43:02.823 --> 43:03.744
Either way, he knew he was
losing a daughter that night.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.951
- My father's never seen
far enough past himself

43:07.953 --> 43:09.185
to see his daughter.

43:16.061 --> 43:18.227
Your only concern is why I
returned.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.231
You already knew I was alive.

43:24.069 --> 43:26.869
(somber music)

43:44.823 --> 43:47.290
- [August] Thought you'd at
least get one.

43:47.292 --> 43:49.292
- Ah, never lecture.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.061
Hope exceeds your own grasp,
August.

43:53.098 --> 43:54.497
- If it wasn't for us,

43:54.498 --> 43:55.897
the damn walls wouldn't even be
standing.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.034
- Oh, stop with your mouth.

43:58.036 --> 43:59.936
If it wasn't us,

43:59.937 --> 44:01.837
they'd have just caught the
next two able-bodied fellas

44:01.840 --> 44:03.272
capable to the job.

44:04.209 --> 44:05.875
Be grateful for the work

44:09.180 --> 44:12.181
and the smell of the
freshly stained timbers.

44:13.385 --> 44:16.185
The vibrant red glow of the
curtains.

44:17.689 --> 44:19.656
The creaking of the tight
stretched ropes

44:19.658 --> 44:23.960
just groaning with a strain.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.828
Twas the life or wasn't it?

44:28.667 --> 44:29.666
- Truly.

44:31.002 --> 44:34.170
(train whistle blowing)

44:34.172 --> 44:36.939
(coughing)

44:36.941 --> 44:38.808
Why don't you head on home now,
okay?

44:38.810 --> 44:39.809
It's freezing.

44:40.845 --> 44:42.345
I've one this a hundred times.

44:42.347 --> 44:43.346
- I know.

44:43.348 --> 44:46.215
I'll finish up as soon
as the train leaves.

44:46.217 --> 44:49.085
- And don't bother the engineer.

44:49.087 --> 44:52.455
(train rails clanking)

45:02.701 --> 45:05.234
(eerie music)

45:11.242 --> 45:13.009
- [Jamieson] Allye.

45:16.848 --> 45:18.881
(gunshot booming)

45:18.883 --> 45:20.133
- [Allye] No.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.384
No, no, no, no, no.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.253
Jamieson, no.

45:24.255 --> 45:26.923
No, no, you don't have to go.

45:26.925 --> 45:29.125
Please, don't go, please.

45:30.395 --> 45:33.796
(dramatic music)

45:33.798 --> 45:36.733
(train chugging)

45:50.048 --> 45:52.982
(dramatic music)

46:00.892 --> 46:03.426
(eerie music)

46:23.381 --> 46:26.249
(ominous music)

46:35.326 --> 46:40.062
(thudding)
(groaning)

47:00.018 --> 47:02.885
(ominous music)

47:14.599 --> 47:16.299
(birds chirping)

47:16.301 --> 47:17.684
- Your father stated in his
report

47:17.685 --> 47:19.068
that he was attacked
that night by the actor

47:19.070 --> 47:20.369
with a ball-peen hammer.

47:24.142 --> 47:26.209
- Are you the only one who
knows?

47:26.211 --> 47:27.622
- My grandfather.

47:27.623 --> 47:29.034
But he made me promise on his
life

47:29.035 --> 47:30.446
that I wouldn't breathe a word
of it.

47:31.216 --> 47:33.115
The hammer belonged to us.

47:33.117 --> 47:35.852
No question where the blame will
go.

47:42.093 --> 47:44.861
You have no intention of
having your father convicted.

47:46.130 --> 47:48.064
- I could've done that two years
ago.

47:48.066 --> 47:50.466
(chuckling)

47:56.574 --> 47:58.407
- You know what a girl
like yourself would receive

47:58.409 --> 48:00.209
if she walked into your
father's clinic with

48:00.211 --> 48:02.178
a cough and a fever?

48:03.448 --> 48:04.447
- An exam?

48:04.449 --> 48:06.883
Perhaps a treatment of oxygen?

48:06.885 --> 48:08.885
- Right.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.886
You know what I would get
for those same symptoms?

48:15.126 --> 48:18.895
Just told to breathe deep and
smoke until the pain subsides.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.931
That it would relax the throat
and lungs.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.970
See, people like your father,

48:27.972 --> 48:29.572
they live above everybody else.

48:30.541 --> 48:33.376
He's only for himself
and the people like him.

48:33.378 --> 48:35.511
No outside greater balance
exists,

48:35.513 --> 48:37.113
even within his own circle.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.585
(door clunking)

48:42.587 --> 48:45.588
(distant chattering)

48:45.590 --> 48:47.390
- Thank you, again.

48:49.394 --> 48:52.428
- Westbound train passes
through here tonight.

48:52.430 --> 48:54.463
It's not going to again for two
days.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.235
See you around here tomorrow?

49:02.674 --> 49:05.107
- I have yet to accomplish
what I came here for.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.984
(tapping)

49:18.723 --> 49:21.390
(tapping)

49:21.392 --> 49:24.260
(clock ticking)

49:31.602 --> 49:32.601
- Sir?

49:33.504 --> 49:35.972
(tapping)

49:38.977 --> 49:40.076
Sir?

49:40.078 --> 49:41.444
- The entire block

49:42.981 --> 49:44.480
smells like horse shit.

49:47.185 --> 49:48.617
- What, sir?

49:48.619 --> 49:52.588
- I bring in a new show for
the first time in two years

49:53.424 --> 49:56.325
and I promise it's gonna
be new and cutting edge.

49:57.695 --> 50:01.630
Not the lesser sophisticated
variety coming form up north.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.166
And yet,

50:06.571 --> 50:10.106
it smells like we are housing
the entire Union Calvary

50:10.108 --> 50:11.273
behind the theater.

50:17.181 --> 50:19.515
And the patrons who
saw the show last night

50:20.718 --> 50:24.053
don't have the slightest idea
that the headliner they missed

50:27.158 --> 50:28.290
was, in fact,

50:31.596 --> 50:32.628
a negro.

50:39.771 --> 50:42.571
So tell me, Jack, what do
you propose that I do now?

50:44.142 --> 50:46.108
- I don't know, sir, I
didn't know, as I said.

50:46.110 --> 50:47.176
- You didn't know.

50:48.613 --> 50:50.179
- Sir, August was--

50:50.181 --> 50:51.313
- Sir!

50:51.315 --> 50:52.314
August,

50:53.184 --> 50:54.183
the foreman?

50:59.824 --> 51:01.057
Tell me, son,

51:02.360 --> 51:04.093
what do you think I should do?

51:08.399 --> 51:10.066
- Sir, I could only imagine

51:11.469 --> 51:13.135
refund the patrons.

51:13.805 --> 51:16.439
Perhaps offer them a simple
apology.

51:16.441 --> 51:17.573
- Apology?

51:18.843 --> 51:20.576
Apologize.

51:20.577 --> 51:22.310
My employees haven't the
slightest idea

51:22.313 --> 51:24.180
how to manage their
responsibilities.

51:24.182 --> 51:25.748
- I wasn't able to attend, sir.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.618
I couldn't afford a ticket, sir.

51:34.492 --> 51:36.192
- Perhaps August is right.

51:37.228 --> 51:38.811
Refund them for last night

51:38.812 --> 51:40.395
and we'll surely sell
any remanding tickets

51:40.398 --> 51:42.098
for tomorrow night.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.816
- Of course.

51:43.817 --> 51:45.533
Why shouldn't I sacrifice
for the hard working

51:45.536 --> 51:47.703
and deserving people of this
town?

51:47.705 --> 51:50.406
They have a right to a
town and my practice,

51:50.408 --> 51:51.874
and of course, entertainment.

51:51.876 --> 51:54.477
After all, it was their
callus little hands

51:54.479 --> 51:57.213
the forged the bricks
that I build it with.

52:09.760 --> 52:10.759
So it's settled.

52:13.531 --> 52:15.064
Be off.

52:15.065 --> 52:16.598
The theater needs cleaning
before tonight.

52:16.601 --> 52:18.467
- It's already done.

52:18.469 --> 52:19.668
- Do it again.

52:31.282 --> 52:32.648
- [William] When is money more
valuable

52:32.650 --> 52:34.650
than your reputation, Willard?

52:34.652 --> 52:36.585
(ominous music)

52:36.587 --> 52:37.720
- This show,

52:37.722 --> 52:40.723
this show is eroding my
reputation.

52:40.725 --> 52:45.261
- And the main attraction will
be well to resume Saturday?

52:46.297 --> 52:47.830
- Two days is long enough.

52:50.168 --> 52:52.535
- Is he really like everyone is
saying?

52:52.537 --> 52:53.769
His size, his strength.

52:53.771 --> 52:57.540
- I've yet to see what he does
in person.

52:57.542 --> 52:59.692
Supposedly it's remarkable
enough

52:59.693 --> 53:01.843
it brings people back three
or four times just to see it.

53:03.181 --> 53:06.282
That, according to Jack,
apparently.

53:06.284 --> 53:09.852
- Well, I think it is a
wise idea to make them wait.

53:10.621 --> 53:13.189
Exclusivity only leads
to heightened desires.

53:14.258 --> 53:16.926
(ominous music)

53:20.464 --> 53:22.965
- I wanna ask you a question.

53:25.403 --> 53:28.804
And I want you to think openly
about it.

53:32.343 --> 53:33.876
Have you ever seen the dead?

53:36.347 --> 53:37.746
- Willard, still?

53:38.649 --> 53:39.848
- It's worse.

53:43.221 --> 53:45.354
- Any new ideas who it could be?

53:45.356 --> 53:47.523
- I've told you before, it's not
a man.

53:47.525 --> 53:49.625
- Oh, Willard, it is a fool in a
mask.

53:49.627 --> 53:51.594
A fool will only be demanding
money.

53:51.596 --> 53:53.563
That's all they ever want.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.531
- There was no one else on
that platform that night.

53:56.667 --> 53:57.666
- So?

53:59.637 --> 54:00.970
- I see him wearing

54:02.807 --> 54:05.241
exactly what he had on that
night.

54:08.512 --> 54:09.578
- Then who?

54:10.848 --> 54:12.781
An accomplice of his?

54:13.584 --> 54:16.435
No one new him.

54:16.436 --> 54:19.287
How about another
degenerate taken with Allye?

54:19.290 --> 54:21.557
I swear, sometimes I wish
you hadn't killed the bastard

54:21.559 --> 54:24.393
so I could kill him
myself, that precious girl.

54:25.296 --> 54:27.830
(eerie music)

54:30.701 --> 54:32.901
But I'm sorry Willard, as I was
saying,

54:32.903 --> 54:35.404
either someone is patronizing
you

54:35.406 --> 54:37.740
or you've been drinking with
someone more than just me,

54:37.742 --> 54:39.808
in which case, we have a real
problem.

54:41.545 --> 54:43.946
Oh yes, I wrote to my brother in
New York.

54:43.948 --> 54:46.548
I told him of the show
that you brought in.

54:46.550 --> 54:49.752
He and his wife love the
theater and attend regularly.

54:49.754 --> 54:53.489
I'm sure he's seen or,
at least, heard of them.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.861
As for tomorrow night,

54:58.863 --> 55:01.430
just give a nice and heartfelt
apology.

55:02.867 --> 55:04.933
- I have nothing to apologize
for.

55:04.935 --> 55:06.502
(chuckling)

55:06.503 --> 55:08.070
- Then make something up,
Willard.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.308
And after you've finished,

55:12.910 --> 55:14.710
come back to my lovely
establishment.

55:14.712 --> 55:16.712
You know you're welcome here
anytime.

55:17.715 --> 55:19.715
You've never seen that thing
here, right?

55:20.718 --> 55:21.717
(chuckling)

55:21.719 --> 55:22.718
- No.

55:23.988 --> 55:25.855
- Willard,

55:25.856 --> 55:27.723
sometimes people need to see us

55:27.725 --> 55:29.692
reduced to their own
understanding.

55:31.062 --> 55:32.695
Let them see you relate.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.699
(ominous music)

56:27.651 --> 56:29.051
- I'm so sorry.

56:32.390 --> 56:34.790
I had no idea how difficult
this was gonna be.

56:35.593 --> 56:36.725
I miss you.

56:37.862 --> 56:39.128
I miss my little girl.

56:46.036 --> 56:48.804
(somber music)

56:59.517 --> 57:01.183
I have to apologize.

57:05.823 --> 57:07.123
Some of you may remember,

57:07.124 --> 57:08.424
two years ago, on this
exact day, my child,

57:08.426 --> 57:10.426
my only child was taken from me

57:10.428 --> 57:12.895
from a performer from this very
stage.

57:18.068 --> 57:20.836
I miscalculated, I miscalculated
about...

57:22.573 --> 57:24.440
seeing her seats full again
and...

57:27.978 --> 57:30.579
how much we enjoyed that
together.

57:32.450 --> 57:36.118
But I assure you, I assure you
that if,

57:36.120 --> 57:38.520
let me see, I assure you we will
reopen

57:39.890 --> 57:41.990
tomorrow night with a fire and
excitement

57:41.992 --> 57:44.059
that I know my daughter would
welcome.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.530
Prayed she'd be with us this
evening.

57:50.201 --> 57:52.801
(chuckling)

58:00.177 --> 58:03.479
(foreboding music)

58:07.551 --> 58:10.152
(somber music)

58:19.163 --> 58:21.096
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen.

58:22.766 --> 58:26.068
I wanted to take a moment
and address you properly.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.904
To inform you that this
evening's performance

58:28.906 --> 58:30.606
unfortunately is canceled
entirely

58:30.608 --> 58:32.608
and will reopen again tomorrow
night.

58:34.278 --> 58:36.078
Everyone here, this evening,

58:36.080 --> 58:38.947
including the victims
of last night's letdown

58:38.949 --> 58:42.084
will be given a full refund
for your ticket price.

58:42.086 --> 58:43.919
And, in addition,

58:43.921 --> 58:47.055
a free ticket to any street
activities

58:47.057 --> 58:49.291
outside for the remainder of the
weekend.

58:53.931 --> 58:55.631
I have to apologize.

58:58.202 --> 59:01.703
Some of you may remember
that two years ago,

59:03.641 --> 59:04.940
on this exact date,

59:06.544 --> 59:09.077
was the evening my only
child was taken from me

59:10.281 --> 59:13.081
by the hands of a performer
from this very stage.

59:14.585 --> 59:16.585
But for the love of
theater and entertainment

59:16.587 --> 59:17.786
we all come here for,

59:20.024 --> 59:21.557
my daughter was murdered.

59:24.628 --> 59:26.929
I chose this weekend
intentionally,

59:28.899 --> 59:31.016
after these two long years,

59:31.017 --> 59:33.134
to reopen this theater
to honor my daughter

59:36.707 --> 59:40.976
and to restore the hope
that theater brings.

59:44.014 --> 59:46.848
But I miscalculated how
difficult that would be

59:48.886 --> 59:50.852
seeing her seats full again,

59:52.590 --> 59:54.856
as she and I used to enjoy
together.

59:55.593 --> 59:58.327
(dramatic music)

01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:02.197
So, I ask your forgiveness,

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.134
and that out of respect

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:11.940
that you please join me in
closing this show this evening

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:17.713
in remembrance of my precious
Allye.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.651
But I assure you

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:27.189
that we will reopen tomorrow
with the fire and excitement

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.393
that I know she would welcome,

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:38.266
should she have been here
with us this evening.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:41.737
(audience applauding)

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:48.877
Thank you.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:59.354
(somber tempo music)

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:07.929
(crickets chirping)

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:14.202
(horse hooves clacking)

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:26.982
(somber tempo music)

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:42.698
(crickets chirping)

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:49.071
(bell ringing)

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.983
(eerie music)

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.853
(thudding)

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:07.189
(groaning)

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.128
(gun clicking)

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.031
(sinister music)

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.371
(gunshot booming)

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:24.506
Come here!

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:28.143
(suspenseful music)

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.377
Who are you?!

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:30.779
Who are you?!

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:34.149
(bell ringing)

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.887
(groaning)

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.290
(ominous music)

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:08.483
(screaming)

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:11.052
- Why couldn't you just do it?

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:15.056
(ominous music)

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:35.143
(dramatic music)

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.345
(crying)

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.826
(door creaking)

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.429
(crying)

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:15.917
- Sorry for what happened to
you.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:20.322
I know you've never had the
comfort of hearing those words

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:23.124
and I can't imagine going
through that on your own.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:33.268
- Kiss me.

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:40.141
- No.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:42.978
- Kiss me.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.383
(dramatic music)

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:14.175
- Where's the hat, Allye?

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.647
Allye, where's the hat?

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:20.949
- I was right there.

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:25.153
All I had to do was pull
the trigger and I couldn't.

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:26.087
He grabbed me.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.506
- He what?

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:28.924
- I didn't mean to--
- What?!

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.495
There are rules, Allye!

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.931
Specific methods to follow
when wearing this mask!

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:38.233
You do not speak, you do not
touch

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:39.751
and God forbid you ever corner
yourself

01:05:39.752 --> 01:05:41.268
in a situation where you could
be caught.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.437
- Be calm, he didn't see who I
was.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.172
- That's not the point!

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.108
He's only terrified of
this because he believes

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.660
it is not real!

01:05:48.661 --> 01:05:50.211
It is out of his control if it's
not real.

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:52.280
Have you seen him alone in this
theater?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.932
No!

01:05:53.933 --> 01:05:55.583
Because he believes in what
lingers within these walls!

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:03.024
For over a year I've haunted him

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.426
as the man that he murdered

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:07.462
and you just ruined it.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.230
- It's not ruined.

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:10.231
- Really?

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:12.233
- Then let's act now.

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:14.586
Before the sun rises.

01:06:14.587 --> 01:06:16.103
The two of us, we can overpower
him.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.006
- Overpower him?

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.609
You think I'm gonna help you
murder him?

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.610
- Hey!

01:06:23.714 --> 01:06:25.747
I came here for one thing!

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:29.584
You've been the only obstacle in
my way!

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:31.297
If it wasn't for you,

01:06:31.298 --> 01:06:33.009
I wouldn't even still be
in this pathetic town!

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:34.721
- You don't even exist
in this pathetic town.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:39.027
You have resolved to the same
felt as him.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:43.565
You can create an entirely
new life for yourself

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:45.033
and you came back here.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:50.171
- For two years I've
been plagued with knowing

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.607
that my so-called father robbed
me

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.610
of the only desire I ever
pursued.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:59.647
Every day I look around and I
wonder

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:01.549
how much better my life would be

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:04.252
if I had, indeed, just
done as he had asked

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:08.156
had I pursued medicine
as was expected of me.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.027
Maybe he was right.

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:16.264
But then he proved his
intentions

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:18.199
when he pulled that trigger.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:23.405
- Revenge is nothing but
self-serving.

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:26.141
There's no freedom in that.

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:27.475
- Oh,

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.344
and you're not taking the same?

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.647
Had my father given you
and your grandfather

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.750
seats in the front row, I'd
imagine you'd feel differently.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:41.056
I've tired to move on.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.193
I will only be able to forgive
him

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:48.063
when he feels the same pain he's
dealt.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:52.467
- That's not forgiveness.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:57.539
Get out of that suit!

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:09.751
(pleasant fiddle music)

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.604
(men chattering)

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.604
- August.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.519
William, here, is just
asking me some questions

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.432
about the vaudeville
troop we've been hosting.

01:08:36.433 --> 01:08:39.345
- Jack tells me you're the
mastermind behind this
operation.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:40.865
(chuckling)

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:42.381
- I think he's just being
modest.

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:44.185
- He said you found the troop
yourself.

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:45.353
Did all the research on them

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.622
and the legwork to get 'em here.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.758
- I did, yes.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.861
- And had you seen the troop
prior?

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.265
- No, sir, I had only heard of
them.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:59.233
They're one of the most talked
about shows in the east.

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:00.635
- Oh, indeed, they are.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.805
My brother happens to frequent
the theater in the east,

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.908
a fair critic, I might add.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.278
(ominous music)

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:14.249
Most talked about only of
embarrassment.

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.151
They've been kicked out of
numerous venues

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:18.252
for their progressive agenda.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.221
- August, how much
research did you do prior?

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.457
Who did you even speak to about
this?

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:28.196
- It is my guess that
your foreman was only out

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.497
to soil the name of Willard
Pearrow.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.301
You were determined for this
show to fail, where you not?

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.935
- Sir, I'm sorry but

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:36.438
August has been nothing

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.939
but a valuable asset to this
theater.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:39.439
He's never do anything so
destructive.

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:45.947
August?

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.282
- You don't deny it?

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:51.853
You knew Allye, didn't you?

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.455
You knew the boy who killed her.

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:56.224
Is this some sort of payback for
Willard

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:58.793
killing your reprehensible
friend?

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.461
Hmmm?

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.397
Get Willard on the wire.

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:03.420
Hey!

01:10:03.421 --> 01:10:04.442
Hey, where do you think you're
going?!

01:10:04.443 --> 01:10:05.464
- Get back here!

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:08.236
(suspenseful music)

01:10:08.238 --> 01:10:10.088
- Hey!

01:10:10.089 --> 01:10:11.939
Hey, you think you're just
gonna walk away from this?!

01:10:11.942 --> 01:10:13.642
Hey!

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:15.343
You turn around when
I'm addressing you, boy!

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:16.211
You turn around!

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:17.679
Out of my way!

01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:21.416
Hey, August, where do
you think you're going?!

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:22.617
This is our town, boy!

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:25.920
August, hey!

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.790
(ominous music)

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:32.760
- Do you think this
suit makes you powerful?

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:33.761
Huh?

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:37.832
Here,

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.901
I could injure you right now

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:42.303
and I'd be gone before anyone
knew what happened to you.

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:43.771
- Willard will hear of this.

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.508
- Do you think that's wise?

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:54.816
- That's not all you're
doing to him, is it?

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.535
Hmmm?

01:10:56.536 --> 01:10:58.253
Oh, you don't intimidate
me the way you do him.

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:02.423
(ominous music)

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:35.290
(somber music)

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:41.963
- There's a night train
headed west tonight.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:44.799
He knows.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:48.469
I don't know the extent
but he knows something

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.671
or he will very soon.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:53.441
- I'm not leaving until
I have what I came for.

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:00.515
- The first night that I
encountered him,

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:01.783
I had every intention of
disclosing

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:03.251
what I'd seen that night

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.718
under a mask that would protect
me.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:07.588
Before I even uttered a word,

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:10.692
the look of fear in his face

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:12.994
from what he thought
that he was looking at

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:15.863
was more humiliating than
anything that I'd ever seen.

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:21.936
He look terrified.

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:23.270
Like a pathetic little bully

01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:24.604
who was finally facing
backlash from is peers.

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.983
I wanted him to pay for what
he'd done.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.721
I wanted to see him tried and
hanged.

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:42.807
But little-did-I-know

01:12:42.808 --> 01:12:44.524
that this would be so
much more fulfilling.

01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:48.529
Death does not feel the same to
all of us.

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:59.006
I have a plan and I
can't do it without you

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:00.475
but he stays alive.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.979
Do you understand me?

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:08.383
(somber tempo music)

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:06.908
(door thudding)

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:09.777
(ominous music)

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:39.073
(sinister music)

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.913
- How the hell did you get
this?!

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.650
You stole it from my house!

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:55.756
What now, coward?

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.160
Show me your face!

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:02.096
You keep it covered because you
know what I could do to you!

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:07.869
(eerie music)

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.141
What?

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:17.178
Are you gonna kill me now?

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:19.180
Finally?

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:24.886
(sinister music)

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:34.195
You stop.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:35.796
You stop.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:36.764
Stop!

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:37.932
Stop!

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:38.799
Stop!

01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:40.001
You stop!

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:43.671
No, wait!

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:44.539
Wait!

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:45.206
Wait!

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:46.073
Wait, wait, no!

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:46.941
No! No! No!

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:47.975
No! No! No!

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:55.816
(ominous music)

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:16.237
- Boo.
(gasping)

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.773
(thudding)

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:24.612
(foreboding music)

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:35.623
(faint crowd commotion echoing)

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.896
(groaning)

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:54.675
(thudding)
(groaning)

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.317
(eerie music)

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:21.836
- Do you know how this knife was
made?

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:26.907
Starts nothing more than a block
of ore.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.077
It's heated in a kiln.

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:31.278
Slowly melted.

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.682
Longer, thinner, sleeker.

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.084
Then an edge.

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:39.920
Finally,

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:42.790
a shinny and polished blade.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:48.329
A tool made from the very
callused hands that you despise.

01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:51.899
Yet, in this moment,

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:55.002
when in these hands make
no different, does it,

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:56.003
you and I?

01:17:58.141 --> 01:18:01.208
(muffled speaking)

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:06.013
- It was you all along.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:10.351
I thought it was reaching
out from the grave.

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:15.289
(ominous music)

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.693
I gave you a chance.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:20.194
- You had a chance.

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:24.298
I let you get away with murder
once

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.167
and it wasn't gonna happen
again.

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:28.903
- What?

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:30.838
What're you talking about?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.108
(ominous tempo music)

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:00.434
- I only ever asked
for one thing from you.

01:19:05.775 --> 01:19:08.242
I had in my possession
your most damning secret.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.147
I needed your help in return.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:17.952
(ominous music)

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:24.992
The thought of my grandfather
was never your concern.

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.027
Only how the people around you
stared.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.435
See, if you had taken the
moment to look at my grandfather

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:36.370
the first time, you would
know that cigar smoke

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:38.472
only worsens his condition,
doesn't it?

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.629
But an old blacksmith like him,

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:46.280
he wasn't warranted a
diagnoses from Dr. Pearrow.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.151
(ominous music)

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:53.354
- I didn't know.

01:19:58.261 --> 01:19:59.260
- You knew.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:04.398
It was that moment I fully
realized

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.400
death brings no concern in your
life.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.220
(eerie music)

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:35.496
- [Allye] Father.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.166
- Allye?

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:45.105
- [Allye] For two years I
tried to rid you from my life.

01:20:45.107 --> 01:20:47.208
- You've come back.

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:49.310
(crying)

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:50.311
Oh, darling.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:58.085
It was you?

01:20:58.087 --> 01:20:59.987
It was you the whole time?

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:03.958
- [Allye] Not a day goes
by that I don't despise

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.193
the man I once called my father.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:10.865
- Please, let me see your face.

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:13.400
Please, Allye, I need to
see your face, please.

01:21:13.402 --> 01:21:15.102
Please, Allye.

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:17.938
Please, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.208
Please.
(crying)

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.210
Please, Allye, please.

01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:28.349
(audience applauding)

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:34.154
- Papa, look, there's Dr.
Pearrow!

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:38.025
(audience laughing)

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:45.933
(audience groaning)

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:49.904
(thudding)

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.305
(audience groaning)

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:54.441
(audience laughing)

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:58.579
(groaning)

01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:01.916
(audience laughing)

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:16.597
(gunshot booming)

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.599
(audience gasping)

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.468
(ominous music)

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.704
(audience laughing)

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:26.340
(applauding)

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:29.276
- I don't deserve this.

01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:34.682
- [August] You're gonna wish
you were dead after this.

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.488
(audience applauding)

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:48.262
(audience laughing)

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.202
(eerie music)

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:06.046
Allye, no!

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:08.182
- Allye.

01:23:08.184 --> 01:23:09.616
(gunshot booming)

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.318
(audience gasping)

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.588
(audience applauding)

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:24.999
(ominous music)

01:23:27.036 --> 01:23:29.003
- [Allye] No, August.

01:23:31.207 --> 01:23:32.740
Oh God, are you okay?
- What'd you do?

01:23:32.742 --> 01:23:34.141
- [Allye] Is it deep?

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:36.377
Hold on.

01:23:39.148 --> 01:23:41.615
(applauding)

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.020
August, we have to go.

01:23:46.022 --> 01:23:47.521
We can't miss the train.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:52.426
You have to walk.
(groaning)

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:55.295
(ominous music)

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:02.269
(train wheels creaking)

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:08.175
(somber music)

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:12.446
(audience chattering)

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:25.059
(screaming)

01:24:27.596 --> 01:24:30.464
(ominous music)

01:24:46.549 --> 01:24:49.349
(somber music)

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.687
(August gasping)

01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:55.289
You can make it.

01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:56.790
Just a bit.
- No, I can't do it.

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:59.760
(August gasping)

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.463
- [August] Ow!

01:25:02.465 --> 01:25:04.731
(gasping)

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:09.303
- Okay, let me see it.

01:25:11.474 --> 01:25:12.907
Oh, okay.
- Is it bad?

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:14.341
Ow!
- Put pressure on it.

01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:17.744
(dramatic music)

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:19.346
Okay, stay right here.

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:20.947
- Where you going? What're you
doing?

01:25:20.948 --> 01:25:22.548
- I gotta find something to put
on it.

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:25.519
(dramatic music)

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:30.791
Okay.

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:33.527
- Ow!

01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:36.730
- I know, I know.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:41.012
No.

01:25:41.013 --> 01:25:42.624
We have to make it to the
station.

01:25:42.625 --> 01:25:44.236
- No, no, no, I can't
do that, I can't walk.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.756
- You have to.

01:25:45.757 --> 01:25:47.273
- [August] I can't do it, I'm
not gonna be able to do it.

01:25:47.276 --> 01:25:48.275
- Okay.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.544
Okay.

01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:52.813
(gasping)

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:58.519
You have to tell them that
you had no part in this.

01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:00.254
I forced you to do it, you
didn't know.

01:26:00.256 --> 01:26:01.589
- No you're not, you're not
going.

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:02.923
You can't leave me here.

01:26:02.925 --> 01:26:04.691
- He's not here anymore.

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:05.876
You don't have to worry about
him.

01:26:05.877 --> 01:26:07.060
- We weren't supposed to kill
him.

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:08.244
We agreed that we weren't gonna
do that.

01:26:08.245 --> 01:26:09.428
Why did you do that?

01:26:09.431 --> 01:26:10.664
- I'm sorry.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.600
(dramatic music)

01:26:17.273 --> 01:26:19.173
Would you have still come with
me?

01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:21.542
- I would, I...

01:26:22.912 --> 01:26:25.913
(crowd commotion)

01:26:29.218 --> 01:26:31.618
- Would you have still come with
me?

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.887
(gasping)

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:39.693
Okay.

01:26:41.597 --> 01:26:42.596
Okay.

01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:47.490
I'm so sorry.
- Stay with me.

01:26:47.491 --> 01:26:49.413
- I can't.
- Please don't do this.

01:26:49.414 --> 01:26:51.336
Allye, Allye, you're not gonna
go, please!

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.606
- I'm so sorry.
- You can't go.

01:26:52.608 --> 01:26:54.041
- Put your hand here.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.475
You have to leave your hand
here.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:01.515
It's gonna be okay.

01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:10.290
(suspenseful music)

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:34.014
(people yelling)

01:27:39.822 --> 01:27:40.988
- You little shit!

01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:42.589
Arrest this one!

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:44.625
- [Man] Can't you see he's been
shot?

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:59.673
(suspenseful music)

01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:23.397
(steam hissing)

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:27.934
- Yep.

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:29.303
Just passing through.

01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:31.371
- Wait!

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:38.612
Just me.

01:28:38.614 --> 01:28:41.481
(ominous music)

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.754
(dramatic music)

01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:14.581
(train chugging)

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:17.384
(somber music)

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:51.718
(eerie music)

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:11.071
(foreboding music)

01:30:22.885 --> 01:30:25.819
(metal clinking)

01:30:39.701 --> 01:30:42.602
(dramatic music)

01:30:58.454 --> 01:31:00.887
- [August Voiceover] "I am
the spirit that negates,

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:03.590
"and rightfully so,

01:31:05.027 --> 01:31:06.660
"for all that comes to be

01:31:07.463 --> 01:31:09.095
"deserves to parish wretchedly.

01:31:13.602 --> 01:31:15.535
"'Twere better nothing would
begin.

01:31:17.873 --> 01:31:20.707
"Thus everything that

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:24.478
"Destruction,

"evil represent.

01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:30.884
"That is my proper element."

01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:36.056
(somber piano music)

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:53.039
- [William] He must be handed
over to the marshals at once!

01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:54.774
- Sir, you can't arrest
him in his condition.

01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:56.510
He hasn't woken since his
surgery.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.145
- Will he?

01:31:58.146 --> 01:31:59.779
- He's in no immediate
danger but as I said,

01:31:59.781 --> 01:32:01.648
he hasn't waken since his
surgery.

01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:03.617
- I want to know as soon as he
awakes.

01:32:03.619 --> 01:32:05.919
- I will let you know if he
wakes.

01:32:06.989 --> 01:32:10.257
(ominous tempo music)

01:32:15.664 --> 01:32:17.731
- Daniel, I'm needing to
close all the the accounts

01:32:17.733 --> 01:32:20.800
of Willard Pearrow as well as
any safe boxes in his name.

01:32:20.802 --> 01:32:23.737
I have his testament here.

01:32:23.739 --> 01:32:24.688
- Of course.

01:32:24.689 --> 01:32:25.638
Give me a moment.

01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:29.809
(ominous tempo music)

01:32:39.187 --> 01:32:40.253
- And his accounts.

01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:43.006
- Well this is it here.

01:32:43.007 --> 01:32:44.790
All that remained in his
lockboxes are.

01:32:47.029 --> 01:32:48.695
- There must be some mistake.

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:54.568
- It shows here that the trust
was emptied two days ago.

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:55.903
- Emptied by who?

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.237
Who would have had access
to Willard's trust?

01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:58.872
All his family is dead.

01:33:04.613 --> 01:33:07.814
(somber piano music)

01:33:10.052 --> 01:33:12.252
Well that's not possible.

01:33:13.722 --> 01:33:14.721
She's...

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:25.899
Thank you.

01:33:29.605 --> 01:33:32.339
(dramatic music)

01:34:07.743 --> 01:34:09.242
- Excuse me.

01:34:09.244 --> 01:34:12.012
Is there any chance the boy
wakes up?

01:34:12.014 --> 01:34:13.913
- I'm sorry, sir, are you
family?

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:17.183
- No, no, the boy has no family.

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:19.052
His former employer.

01:34:19.054 --> 01:34:21.021
- Look, we've done all we can.

01:34:21.023 --> 01:34:23.189
All right, we've found no
further damage.

01:34:23.925 --> 01:34:25.825
- The bullet went
through his stomach, yes?

01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:27.193
- Actually, it missed his
stomach.

01:34:27.195 --> 01:34:28.662
Missed all major organs.

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:31.348
Coma's a funny thing.

01:34:31.349 --> 01:34:33.366
It can be induced by a
severe trauma of any kind.

01:34:33.368 --> 01:34:35.035
Doesn't have to be the head.

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.304
- How long can he live like
this?

01:34:38.306 --> 01:34:39.372
- It could be days.

01:34:40.442 --> 01:34:41.675
It could be weeks.

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:45.745
- [Jack] Thank you.

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:51.051
(dramatic music)

01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:23.049
(somber music)

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:46.773
(groaning)

01:35:46.775 --> 01:35:47.774
- Miss,

01:35:47.776 --> 01:35:51.878
how long do I have to be in
this?

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.480
I gotta get back down there.

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:57.117
- Well, it isn't gonna do you
any good

01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:58.918
if you're not alive to spend it.

01:35:59.488 --> 01:36:00.487
- How?

01:36:00.489 --> 01:36:03.056
This will change everything.

01:36:03.892 --> 01:36:06.159
I know it, I gotta get out of
here.

01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:07.160
- Down.

01:36:11.299 --> 01:36:14.100
(somber music)

01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:19.773
(carriage rattling)

01:36:24.179 --> 01:36:27.380
(entry bell ringing)

01:36:39.427 --> 01:36:42.462
- Can I interest you in
a fountain drink, ma'am?

01:36:42.464 --> 01:36:46.032
Mixture of syrup and carbonated
water.

01:36:46.034 --> 01:36:47.300
It'll certainly quench your
thirst

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.567
on what's looking to be a warm
day.

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:53.973
Coming right up.

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:58.111
(somber music)

01:37:20.135 --> 01:37:22.502
(clicking)

01:37:27.976 --> 01:37:30.844
(ominous music)

01:37:40.856 --> 01:37:44.157
(dramatic tempo music)

01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:57.503
(somber music)

01:39:16.384 --> 01:39:19.519
(suspenseful music)

01:40:03.698 --> 01:40:06.666
(dramatic music)

01:40:30.025 --> 01:40:33.326
(dramatic piano music)

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.811
(eerie music)
