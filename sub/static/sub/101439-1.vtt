WEBVTT

01:07.040 --> 01:08.676
I'm Myles Parks.

01:08.709 --> 01:10.210
Thanks for coming out tonight.

01:11.611 --> 01:14.048
I'll start by telling you
a little about myself.

01:15.081 --> 01:17.051
I'm in my mid-30s,

01:18.118 --> 01:19.287
and I'm single.

01:20.153 --> 01:21.555
So that's cool, I guess.

01:25.191 --> 01:28.095
It's like the killer
combo right there.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.030
When you say that to people,

01:29.063 --> 01:30.231
they give you that sad look

01:30.263 --> 01:33.033
like, oh, really?

01:34.234 --> 01:35.469
Like I'm an immigrant from Haiti

01:35.503 --> 01:37.272
who lost his home
in an earthquake.

01:38.204 --> 01:39.039
Same look.

01:39.807 --> 01:43.144
But I'm fine, I'm okay with it,

01:43.177 --> 01:45.714
because my career is soaring.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.764
Settle up.

02:02.796 --> 02:03.798
You in a hurry?

02:03.831 --> 02:05.033
Got a place to be.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.568
Another gig?

02:10.538 --> 02:12.173
We agreed on 50.

02:12.205 --> 02:13.107
You had a drink.

02:13.807 --> 02:16.043
A whiskey coke is $20?

02:16.076 --> 02:17.311
Plus fees.

02:17.343 --> 02:19.280
You didn't exactly
bring in a crowd.

02:19.312 --> 02:22.082
You make me money,
I'll make you money.

02:22.116 --> 02:23.518
You're a walking cliche, Jack.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.790
Nelson Fritch,
I'm a talent agent.

02:32.158 --> 02:34.094
You look like a man in
need of representation.

02:34.127 --> 02:36.096
I've already come
this far on my own.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.698
Sorry I missed the gig.

02:38.731 --> 02:39.766
How'd it go?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.069
About how you'd expect.

02:42.502 --> 02:44.104
Did Jack try to stiff you?

02:44.838 --> 02:46.674
Want me to talk to him?

02:46.706 --> 02:48.675
$20 isn't gonna
help me make rent.

02:49.643 --> 02:52.180
Nelson, you drinking?

02:52.212 --> 02:54.215
I'll have
a lite beer, please.

02:59.385 --> 03:00.421
Four dollars.

03:02.122 --> 03:05.258
Put it
on my tab, asshole.

03:05.292 --> 03:07.594
He's gonna take that
out of my pay next time.

03:07.627 --> 03:10.264
Hey, there won't
be a next time.

03:12.133 --> 03:13.835
Look, I know the gig
tomorrow night is a big deal.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.802
- Huge.
- High profile,

03:15.836 --> 03:18.106
- something or other.
- The biggest of your career.

03:18.139 --> 03:19.574
But it's still just one gig.

03:20.674 --> 03:21.509
Maybe.

03:23.776 --> 03:25.245
I'm working on something.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.583
I don't really wanna say
too much about it right now.

03:30.217 --> 03:31.618
It's big.

03:31.651 --> 03:36.356
Myles, come prepared tomorrow.

03:36.389 --> 03:38.158
It's the Pantages Theater.

03:39.325 --> 03:42.864
I have pulled every
single possible string

03:42.896 --> 03:45.599
to make this happen, and, now,

03:45.633 --> 03:49.137
it's all riding
on you to deliver.

03:50.336 --> 03:51.405
It's exciting, right?

03:53.507 --> 03:55.176
Cut it out, Nelson.

03:55.209 --> 03:56.644
I'm just trying to keep
these expectations in check.

03:59.246 --> 04:00.314
See you
tomorrow, buddy.

04:13.193 --> 04:15.195
Myles, come back soon

04:15.229 --> 04:16.531
and do another set, all right?

04:18.298 --> 04:19.565
Go fuck yourself, Jack.

05:22.428 --> 05:24.298
You're
still here, Lawrence?

05:24.331 --> 05:28.402
Yeah, I was just
finishing up, Miss Gotti.

05:28.435 --> 05:29.836
You know to call me Donna.

05:31.004 --> 05:34.007
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.675
We have a show to get ready for.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.543
Yeah.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.449
Oh, and, Lawrence,
don't forget

05:42.483 --> 05:43.985
to turn on the ghost light.

05:44.017 --> 05:46.820
We wouldn't wanna invite
in any unwanted guests.

06:05.639 --> 06:06.473
Hello?

06:10.310 --> 06:11.545
Miss Gotti?

06:17.550 --> 06:21.622
All right, well, it's time
to go, I'm locking up.

06:32.031 --> 06:33.867
What the fuck is that?

06:35.101 --> 06:36.603
Shit!

06:36.637 --> 06:37.872
Shit, shit.

06:51.785 --> 06:53.454
All right, fuck you!

06:55.088 --> 06:57.324
I'm setting the
alarm and locking up.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.694
The cops will deal with
you when they show up.

10:29.635 --> 10:30.536
The best music.

10:30.571 --> 10:32.105
I'm Jay Barilla,
and I'll be bringing

10:32.139 --> 10:33.774
you more underground music
at the top of the hour.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.042
I'll also be
announcing the winner

10:35.075 --> 10:37.177
of the two free tickets
to the Reggie Ray show

10:37.210 --> 10:38.646
we've been hawking this week,

10:38.678 --> 10:39.779
and, let me tell
you, there has been

10:39.813 --> 10:42.582
no shortage of callers trying
to get at these tickets.

10:42.615 --> 10:45.653
Let's hope Reggie Ray can
regain some of his former glory.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.120
Either way, it'll
be a packed house,

10:47.153 --> 10:48.556
and two lucky
listeners will be there

10:48.589 --> 10:50.558
to report back to us later.

10:50.591 --> 10:53.693
This.

12:09.269 --> 12:11.639
Hey, can I help you out.

12:11.672 --> 12:12.473
If you're here for the show,

12:12.505 --> 12:13.906
you're gonna have
to come back later.

12:13.940 --> 12:16.277
Oh, no, I'm
Myles, Myles Parks.

12:18.144 --> 12:20.079
The opening act, my
name's all over the flyer.

12:20.113 --> 12:21.882
Myles, sorry about
that, nice to meet you.

12:21.914 --> 12:23.317
I'm the stage manager Andy.

12:23.350 --> 12:24.652
Let me show you around.

12:24.684 --> 12:25.752
So we've got a couple of hours

12:25.785 --> 12:27.720
before we start
letting people in.

12:27.754 --> 12:29.223
Relax, get ready.

12:29.255 --> 12:30.790
I was hoping I could
feel the stage out a little

12:30.823 --> 12:31.758
after I've settled in.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.094
Yeah, whatever you need.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.098
Hey, Bryce, where's Lawrence?

12:38.130 --> 12:39.666
It's not my turn to watch him.

12:41.268 --> 12:42.069
I haven't seen him, either.

12:42.101 --> 12:43.236
Okay.

12:43.269 --> 12:46.874
Hey, Bethany, where's Lawrence?

12:48.475 --> 12:49.942
I haven't seen him.

12:49.975 --> 12:51.678
Let me know if you find him.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.312
The ghost light tipped over
last night and shattered.

12:53.346 --> 12:54.414
What's the ghost light?

12:54.447 --> 12:55.448
Oh, it's just an
old superstition.

12:55.481 --> 12:57.083
Theaters are filthy with them.

12:57.116 --> 12:59.052
It's not a superstition
if it's true.

13:00.052 --> 13:01.120
Performer?

13:01.153 --> 13:02.722
Opening act.

13:02.755 --> 13:04.692
No pressure, right?

13:04.725 --> 13:05.426
I hope you're funny.

13:05.458 --> 13:06.526
I think I'm hilarious.

13:06.559 --> 13:09.696
So far, you're not doing
much for my confidence.

13:09.730 --> 13:11.197
Too bad, you're
really helping mine.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.298
Hey, we should get moving.

13:12.331 --> 13:15.468
I've got a lot of things
to do before showtime, so.

13:15.501 --> 13:16.703
Good luck tonight.

13:18.004 --> 13:19.373
This way, try to keep up.

13:23.076 --> 13:25.680
Your room should be right here.

13:32.418 --> 13:33.886
I'll be around.

13:33.919 --> 13:36.055
So if you need anything,
just let me know.

13:36.089 --> 13:38.059
- Thanks.
- Just doing my job.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.008
Oh, for fuck's sake.

14:57.571 --> 14:58.806
Here at last.

15:00.907 --> 15:03.043
Jesus, Nelson,
let yourself in.

15:03.076 --> 15:03.911
I did.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.313
I'm here to save the day.

15:06.346 --> 15:08.115
My knight in shining armor.

15:08.148 --> 15:09.983
You need anything right now?

15:10.015 --> 15:13.486
Besides the gift
basket, my privacy.

15:13.519 --> 15:16.524
You're gonna have all the
privacy you can handle tomorrow.

15:17.857 --> 15:19.559
How you feeling?

15:19.592 --> 15:21.528
Not getting the
jitters on me, are you?

15:23.897 --> 15:25.399
When I woke up this morning,

15:27.299 --> 15:29.502
I swear I smelled
coffee in the house.

15:29.535 --> 15:30.970
You don't drink coffee.

15:31.871 --> 15:32.906
Mia did.

15:41.413 --> 15:42.415
It makes sense.

15:43.649 --> 15:46.853
Tonight is a big night,

15:46.886 --> 15:49.922
and it's gonna bring up a
lot of thoughts and feelings

15:49.956 --> 15:52.192
that you've already
worked through.

15:52.225 --> 15:54.461
Thanks, doc, what am I
paying my therapist for?

15:54.494 --> 15:56.864
Hey, I've been in the
business a long time, okay?

15:56.897 --> 15:57.932
I've seen it.

15:59.566 --> 16:01.067
I think I just need my pills.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.336
I left them somewhere, but
I can't remember where.

16:03.370 --> 16:04.971
It's not the
pills, it's nerves.

16:05.004 --> 16:06.505
Maybe, I sure
would feel better

16:06.538 --> 16:07.942
if I had my pills, though.

16:12.578 --> 16:14.046
Where the hell
did you find them?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.149
At the
bar last night.

16:16.182 --> 16:17.317
It was weird, I went
to the bathroom,

16:17.350 --> 16:19.319
I came back, you were gone,

16:19.351 --> 16:20.653
and the pills were
sitting right there.

16:20.687 --> 16:22.623
When were you
going to tell me?

16:22.655 --> 16:25.125
I was thinking,
maybe, you could

16:25.158 --> 16:27.961
hold off on taking
the pills tonight.

16:27.994 --> 16:29.663
Are you being
serious right now?

16:29.696 --> 16:34.033
Myles, tonight is a big night.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.003
You've said
it for the 6000th time.

16:36.035 --> 16:37.937
I need you to be sharp.

16:37.971 --> 16:40.640
I'm not taking bath
salts, it's medication.

16:40.673 --> 16:43.110
You know what
I'm talking about.

16:43.143 --> 16:44.445
Thanks for the advice.

16:49.316 --> 16:52.952
All I'm asking is that
you think about it, okay?

16:54.254 --> 16:58.225
It's nerves, that's
it, I promise.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.094
I'll think about it.

17:30.056 --> 17:32.960
I wanna start by telling
you something about me.

17:34.027 --> 17:36.163
I am a registered sex offender.

17:38.330 --> 17:40.033
Maybe not the best
place to start.

17:41.468 --> 17:43.036
I'm just kidding!

17:43.068 --> 17:44.437
I'm not registered.

17:45.372 --> 17:46.974
Honestly, I think sex offenders

17:47.007 --> 17:49.043
are the worst kinds of people.

17:50.743 --> 17:53.079
Well, them and door-to-door
Bible salesmen.

17:54.748 --> 17:58.151
Actually, I think door-to-door
Bible salesmen are way worse.

17:58.183 --> 18:00.252
Maybe that's just me.

18:00.286 --> 18:01.587
No, at least sex
offenders aren't trying

18:01.621 --> 18:03.023
to cram something down my throat

18:03.056 --> 18:04.658
every Sunday
morning at eight am.

18:06.425 --> 18:09.028
No, my uncle visits
on Saturdays.

18:19.038 --> 18:21.208
Starting with the
sex offender routine.

18:22.075 --> 18:23.677
Not a good idea?

18:23.710 --> 18:26.346
Doesn't seem to suit
you, not very endearing.

18:26.378 --> 18:28.481
But I'm not a comedian.

18:30.083 --> 18:30.750
Who are you then?

18:30.784 --> 18:32.085
Donna Gotti.

18:32.117 --> 18:33.419
I'm the theater director.

18:34.319 --> 18:35.254
I'm Myles.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.757
- I know.
- Right.

18:38.590 --> 18:40.394
Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

18:40.426 --> 18:41.528
Thanks for hosting the show.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.663
I'm excited to be here.

18:43.695 --> 18:45.164
Don't thank me.

18:45.198 --> 18:47.034
I'd be doing Moliere if I could,

18:47.067 --> 18:49.068
but the way people attend
theater these days,

18:49.102 --> 18:52.473
it was necessary to diversify.

18:53.373 --> 18:55.107
Not a fan of comedy?

18:55.141 --> 18:58.245
Moliere was a comedic
writer, Mr. Parks.

18:58.278 --> 18:59.747
You should read him sometime.

19:00.613 --> 19:02.082
You might enjoy yourself.

19:03.450 --> 19:05.052
I wish you the best tonight.

19:11.825 --> 19:14.126
I get it, you're
busy or whatever,

19:14.160 --> 19:15.495
but I need information, so,

19:15.528 --> 19:17.497
if you know anything,
just tell me now.

19:17.529 --> 19:18.798
I don't know anything.

19:18.832 --> 19:20.200
You kids telling secrets?

19:21.366 --> 19:23.502
Hey, did you go
in the basement?

19:23.536 --> 19:25.305
Didn't even know
there was a basement.

19:25.337 --> 19:26.306
I told you.

19:26.338 --> 19:27.240
Check yourself, girlfriend.

19:27.272 --> 19:28.375
We haven't asked everyone yet.

19:28.407 --> 19:29.675
Something go missing?

19:29.709 --> 19:32.245
Somebody broke the
lock on the door.

19:32.278 --> 19:35.115
First, the ghost light,
then the basement door.

19:35.147 --> 19:36.782
You think there's a connection?

19:36.816 --> 19:37.750
Connection?

19:37.784 --> 19:41.088
Yeah, the ghost light
keeps the ghosts away,

19:41.121 --> 19:42.855
but somebody shattered it,

19:42.888 --> 19:46.392
so now the ghost is here.

19:46.425 --> 19:48.727
Ah, it makes sense when you
say it all out loud like that.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.829
No, the ghost light
is there to keep

19:49.863 --> 19:51.530
you from falling into
the orchestra pit

19:51.564 --> 19:52.833
and breaking your stupid neck.

19:52.865 --> 19:54.533
Then why is it
called a ghost light?

19:54.567 --> 19:56.336
I'm pretty sure it's because
break your stupid neck light

19:56.368 --> 19:57.803
doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

19:57.836 --> 19:59.172
I kinda like it.

19:59.204 --> 20:00.005
You're just
being a spoilsport.

20:00.038 --> 20:01.441
No, I'm trying
to figure out who

20:01.473 --> 20:02.675
broke the lock on
the effing door.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.611
This is a real thing
that really happened.

20:04.644 --> 20:05.846
You can't just break
stuff around here.

20:05.878 --> 20:08.180
This place barely makes
enough money as it is.

20:08.213 --> 20:11.183
He's just trying to take
your mind off our ghost

20:11.217 --> 20:12.686
so that you can do your show.

20:12.719 --> 20:14.287
Wait, you
actually have a ghost?

20:14.319 --> 20:15.221
- Yeah.
- No.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.823
No, we do not have a ghost.

20:16.855 --> 20:20.192
This theater has a
twisted history, man.

20:20.226 --> 20:22.829
She's a tragedy nut, King
Lear's her favorite play.

20:22.862 --> 20:24.464
Gets me every time.

20:24.497 --> 20:26.166
Well, I'll pretend
that makes sense to me.

20:26.199 --> 20:27.634
Good luck finding that ghost.

20:27.666 --> 20:29.836
You know about the story
of what happened here?

20:29.868 --> 20:31.670
It's brutal and it's awesome.

20:31.703 --> 20:32.739
And it's not real.

20:32.771 --> 20:33.807
Shut up, Andy!

20:33.839 --> 20:35.108
You don't know that.

20:38.243 --> 20:40.813
It was probably Bryce that
broke the lock, anyway.

20:40.846 --> 20:41.780
I'm good, actually.

20:41.814 --> 20:43.283
I have a show to get ready for.

20:46.685 --> 20:48.254
Do you actually
think it was Bryce?

20:48.288 --> 20:48.889
Hey!

20:55.228 --> 20:56.196
Yo, Myles.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.433
Reggie Ray.

21:01.401 --> 21:02.302
The one and only.

21:02.335 --> 21:04.171
Oh, I'm a big fan.

21:05.672 --> 21:07.141
Kind words, man.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.608
Come on in, I thought
we should get together

21:09.642 --> 21:12.211
and have a chat about how
our big show's gonna go.

21:12.244 --> 21:13.279
Sure.

21:21.520 --> 21:25.192
So which one of my movies
sold you on my comic genius?

21:25.224 --> 21:26.292
Kid's Quest?

21:27.527 --> 21:28.528
Tiny Ninjas?

21:29.862 --> 21:32.231
I think it was
Time Leapers III.

21:33.566 --> 21:36.569
My nephews almost
disowned me for that one.

21:36.603 --> 21:38.337
Part four wasn't bad, though.

21:38.371 --> 21:39.840
I'll take your word for it.

21:40.874 --> 21:43.809
So, listen, I had a chance
to ask around about you.

21:43.843 --> 21:45.545
People say you're funny.

21:45.577 --> 21:47.314
You talked to my mother.

21:47.346 --> 21:49.583
Look at that line.

21:49.615 --> 21:50.884
Good stuff, Myles.

21:52.285 --> 21:54.621
I'd drop the "mother,"
though, too formal.

21:54.653 --> 21:57.223
"Mom" is shorter and funnier.

21:57.257 --> 21:58.458
Brevity, Myles.

21:58.490 --> 22:00.660
I'll try to keep that in mind.

22:00.692 --> 22:03.462
Hey, you wanna take
advantage of the spread?

22:03.496 --> 22:04.698
They got some good stuff here.

22:04.730 --> 22:06.200
I never eat before a show.

22:13.905 --> 22:15.576
Listen, let's
cut to the chase.

22:17.509 --> 22:19.346
Whose name is out
there on the flyer?

22:20.946 --> 22:22.248
Both of ours.

22:22.281 --> 22:23.317
Really?

22:24.017 --> 22:24.817
Yeah.

22:24.851 --> 22:26.453
Yours is on top in
the big letters,

22:26.486 --> 22:28.722
and mine is down below
in tiny little letters.

22:29.922 --> 22:31.357
I must've missed that.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.826
But my point's the same.

22:34.426 --> 22:36.730
Whose name is on top in
the big, bold letters?

22:40.767 --> 22:42.501
Oh, that's your name.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.304
Your name is on top in
the big letters and...

22:44.336 --> 22:45.372
Whose name is at the bottom
in the tiny, little letters?

22:45.404 --> 22:47.007
That's my name.

22:47.039 --> 22:48.807
Exactly.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.476
See, I've been doing
these comedy shows

22:50.509 --> 22:52.511
longer than I've been
doing these kids' movies,

22:52.545 --> 22:55.981
and these people are
here to see my comeback.

22:56.015 --> 22:57.517
Naturally.

22:57.549 --> 22:59.019
But the opening act, I
mean, it's important, too.

22:59.051 --> 23:01.387
You get to warm up the crowd.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.557
Everybody's psyched
up for the big show.

23:04.523 --> 23:06.392
But don't overstep.

23:06.425 --> 23:07.394
Know your place.

23:08.594 --> 23:11.431
It's not easy to do,
it takes a finesse.

23:12.597 --> 23:14.600
When looking at you, I know

23:14.634 --> 23:16.470
you're a man who
knows his place.

23:18.538 --> 23:19.740
Thanks for the advice.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.642
Any time.

23:22.674 --> 23:24.443
I like to think of
myself as a mentor.

23:25.577 --> 23:27.579
See, this business,
it's got rules,

23:27.613 --> 23:30.317
and I just wanted to make
sure that we got together

23:30.349 --> 23:32.351
and shared the same vision about

23:32.384 --> 23:33.886
how it's gonna go down tonight.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.355
Can you please excuse me now?

23:35.387 --> 23:36.889
I really gotta get
ready for my set.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.692
Preparation is key.

23:39.726 --> 23:40.694
Break a leg, Myles.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.572
Hi, everyone, I'm Myles Parks.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.341
Reggie Ray can go fuck himself.

24:42.688 --> 24:45.425
Ooh, whoa,
what's up with you?

24:48.594 --> 24:50.630
Pressure's really
getting to you, huh?

24:53.699 --> 24:54.534
No.

24:58.805 --> 25:00.374
Dude, what's up?

25:04.443 --> 25:07.114
There's a dead body
in my dressing room.

25:08.647 --> 25:09.648
No shit?

25:10.583 --> 25:12.652
Why would I joke about
something like that?

25:12.684 --> 25:15.087
I don't know, 'cause
you're a comedian

25:15.121 --> 25:16.523
and that's your job?

25:16.556 --> 25:18.124
Like I'm on the
clock right now?

25:18.156 --> 25:20.125
Don't get upset.

25:20.159 --> 25:22.629
I dig it, it's my kind of humor.

25:24.029 --> 25:26.432
But if you think I'm
really that gullible,

25:26.465 --> 25:28.434
you and Andy can
go fuck yourselves.

25:28.468 --> 25:30.003
Nice try, though.

25:37.977 --> 25:39.646
Nelson,
we need to talk.

25:39.679 --> 25:40.780
Okay.

25:40.813 --> 25:41.980
Sorry, he's a little bit...

25:42.013 --> 25:43.115
It's cool, I work
in the theater.

25:43.148 --> 25:45.551
Everybody's got a crazy process.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.920
Nelson, you're not
gonna believe this.

25:46.952 --> 25:48.454
No, you're not
gonna believe this.

25:48.488 --> 25:49.589
No, listen, this is serious!

25:49.622 --> 25:50.824
Can it.

25:50.856 --> 25:51.758
Remember last night,
I was telling you

25:51.790 --> 25:53.659
I was working on something big?

25:53.692 --> 25:56.996
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Well, it came through.

25:57.028 --> 25:58.464
What are we talking about?

25:58.498 --> 26:00.232
Guess who's coming
to the show tonight?

26:00.266 --> 26:02.000
Isabella Hooper.

26:02.034 --> 26:03.135
Who's Isabella Hooper?

26:03.169 --> 26:06.072
She's the booking
agent for the Daily Dish.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.575
The Daily Dish?

26:08.607 --> 26:10.876
Every successful
comic in the last decade

26:10.910 --> 26:13.613
got their start
on the Daily Dish.

26:13.645 --> 26:15.548
Once you're in, you're in.

26:16.548 --> 26:17.550
Come here.

26:24.557 --> 26:26.492
Look at those people.

26:27.626 --> 26:29.895
If you impress those
people tonight,

26:29.929 --> 26:32.599
your days of worrying
about rent are over.

26:34.066 --> 26:35.235
Isabella Hooper, huh?

26:36.568 --> 26:41.074
True, my vision, my tenacity,

26:41.973 --> 26:43.576
it's partly responsible.

26:44.977 --> 26:46.112
But she's here for you.

26:48.814 --> 26:49.649
I'll show you.

26:50.682 --> 26:52.018
I sent her this.

26:55.186 --> 26:56.522
Remember that?

26:56.556 --> 26:57.923
Portland, '15.

26:59.325 --> 27:00.293
That was right before...

27:00.326 --> 27:01.627
Stop it.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.596
Before, before.

27:04.630 --> 27:05.765
It's before the medication.

27:06.464 --> 27:10.002
Myles, that's the Myles we need.

27:11.636 --> 27:13.706
That's the one that got
Isabella's attention.

27:14.673 --> 27:16.608
And that's why I'm asking you

27:16.642 --> 27:19.946
to hold off on taking
the pills, for one night.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.015
For this.

27:24.817 --> 27:25.751
You got one shot,

27:26.919 --> 27:28.855
and, if it doesn't
land, there's no way

27:28.887 --> 27:31.090
I'm getting Isabella
back for a second look.

27:32.157 --> 27:34.560
This is it, you understand?

27:37.096 --> 27:39.199
All right, good.

27:43.068 --> 27:44.270
Can I make a suggestion?

27:45.371 --> 27:46.973
Ditch the jacket.

27:47.006 --> 27:48.274
It looks like it's
seen better days,

27:48.307 --> 27:50.943
and maybe those weren't
too good, either.

27:50.977 --> 27:52.312
- See you.
- Yeah.

27:52.345 --> 27:53.646
I'll figure something out.

29:03.182 --> 29:04.683
Hey.

29:04.717 --> 29:06.920
Nelson said you wanted
to know about wardrobe?

29:08.453 --> 29:10.255
It's in the hallway on the
other side of the theater,

29:10.288 --> 29:11.790
right before you get
to the prop room.

29:11.824 --> 29:13.359
Right, thanks.

29:13.392 --> 29:14.394
Just doing my job.

29:25.171 --> 29:25.971
Hello?

29:26.005 --> 29:26.906
Hey.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.642
Are you the wardrobe guy?

29:31.844 --> 29:33.313
It's for a show next month.

29:34.279 --> 29:35.781
Not working?

29:36.715 --> 29:38.850
Is the character a '70s pimp?

29:38.884 --> 29:41.453
Whatever, yeah, I
am the wardrobe guy.

29:41.487 --> 29:42.455
I was
told I should maybe

29:42.488 --> 29:44.791
get a new jacket from you.

29:44.824 --> 29:45.658
That's good advice.

29:45.692 --> 29:47.760
A nice-fitting jacket
goes a long way.

29:48.493 --> 29:50.062
Come on over, I'll measure you.

29:58.903 --> 30:00.338
You nervous?

30:00.372 --> 30:01.708
Why?

30:01.740 --> 30:03.108
Because you're
sweating like two rats

30:03.142 --> 30:05.144
humping in a wool sock.

30:05.176 --> 30:08.380
Oh, yeah, I guess I am.

30:08.413 --> 30:10.249
I'll have to take one of
our jackets in to fit you.

30:10.281 --> 30:11.983
Come back in a bit, and
I'll have you set up.

30:12.017 --> 30:13.486
I appreciate it.

30:13.519 --> 30:14.620
There's a bathroom
down the hallway.

30:14.653 --> 30:17.390
It's not much, but you can
take a whore's bath there.

30:18.223 --> 30:19.791
Excuse me?

30:19.825 --> 30:23.362
You know,
freshen up in the sink.

30:23.394 --> 30:24.230
Thanks.

30:25.297 --> 30:26.399
See you soon.

30:49.954 --> 30:51.290
What have you been doing?

30:52.458 --> 30:54.460
Just a little manual labor.

30:54.492 --> 30:56.962
Helps me loosen up
before big shows.

30:56.996 --> 30:58.064
Manual labor?

31:00.266 --> 31:03.803
I was actually hoping to
find some place to freshen up.

31:03.836 --> 31:06.072
Some place that's not
a public restroom.

31:07.306 --> 31:09.275
I can help you with that.

31:09.307 --> 31:10.143
Follow me.

31:16.882 --> 31:17.549
Nice.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.185
It's my private bathroom.

31:19.218 --> 31:20.452
You're welcome to use it.

31:44.210 --> 31:45.877
Your door's broken.

31:45.911 --> 31:48.847
I never bothered fixing
it, is that a problem?

31:48.881 --> 31:50.283
No, it's cool.

31:57.056 --> 31:58.458
It's totally all cool.

32:18.309 --> 32:19.211
Myles?

32:48.606 --> 32:50.308
Is somebody in here?

33:11.029 --> 33:11.631
Boo!

33:11.663 --> 33:13.965
What the fuck?

33:13.999 --> 33:14.901
Man!

33:17.001 --> 33:18.904
You're just here to see
me with my shirt off.

33:18.938 --> 33:20.573
No, you're not really my type.

33:20.605 --> 33:22.909
Oh, because I'm a man?

33:22.942 --> 33:26.278
Hardy har, your lesbian
joke is so antiquated.

33:26.311 --> 33:27.913
It's actually kinda cute,

33:27.946 --> 33:31.683
like a racist
grandpa or something.

33:31.717 --> 33:33.486
You just called me cute.

33:33.519 --> 33:35.188
- I heard it.
- Whatever.

33:36.321 --> 33:37.188
Donna wants to talk to you.

33:37.221 --> 33:38.691
She's up in her office.

33:38.723 --> 33:42.260
Thanks, I'll try not to
remember that you called me cute.

33:42.294 --> 33:45.498
For the record, when I
said you're not my type,

33:45.530 --> 33:47.500
I meant old.

33:47.532 --> 33:50.035
Ouch, I'm only 30.

33:50.068 --> 33:51.537
Yeah, exactly.

33:51.569 --> 33:54.573
I'll let you get back to
wrestling with your mortality.

36:55.487 --> 36:56.322
Excuse me.

36:58.590 --> 36:59.459
What's up, man?

37:01.293 --> 37:02.128
Nothing.

37:02.927 --> 37:04.262
What's up with you?

37:05.931 --> 37:07.365
Yeah, I was just
waiting for Donna.

37:07.398 --> 37:08.800
I had a few questions about,

37:10.235 --> 37:11.137
look, do you need...

37:11.170 --> 37:12.605
She was just right here.

37:15.273 --> 37:16.641
I guess I'll get
out of your hair

37:16.675 --> 37:19.411
and let you finish up
whatever is going on here, so.

37:19.443 --> 37:21.213
Andy, sit down.

37:25.751 --> 37:27.620
Myles, can I help
you with something?

37:29.621 --> 37:30.523
I need a towel.

37:31.757 --> 37:32.925
There's one in there.

37:32.958 --> 37:34.193
Oh.

37:53.579 --> 37:55.181
Can I help you?

37:55.213 --> 37:58.349
Yeah, I'm Nelson, I manage
tonight's opening act.

37:58.382 --> 38:00.885
Hey, man, that's awesome.

38:00.918 --> 38:03.688
Really, congratulations.

38:03.722 --> 38:05.424
Can you close the
door behind you?

38:09.360 --> 38:12.664
I was told to talk
to Bryce about music cues.

38:12.697 --> 38:16.501
I'm Bryce,
I do the music cues.

38:16.534 --> 38:18.203
Who told you to come talk to me?

38:18.237 --> 38:20.306
Andy, the stage manager.

38:20.338 --> 38:22.740
Yeah, I know who Andy is.

38:22.773 --> 38:24.609
I work here, okay?

38:24.643 --> 38:26.311
Fucking Andy.

38:26.344 --> 38:27.913
Said he tried
to call you on the radio.

38:27.945 --> 38:29.181
Oh, this piece of shit?

38:30.581 --> 38:31.650
Is there a problem?

38:33.284 --> 38:36.888
No, everything
is swell, Nelson.

38:37.822 --> 38:41.226
So, do you have any
specific sound cues in mind

38:41.260 --> 38:43.329
you want played for your talent?

38:44.695 --> 38:48.967
No, just whatever
you think's best.

38:49.001 --> 38:51.903
Just whatever I think is best?

38:51.936 --> 38:54.272
Yeah, you're the sound guy.

38:54.306 --> 38:58.277
First of all, I'm not
the sound guy, Nelson.

38:58.309 --> 39:00.411
I'm the deputy
fucking stage manager.

39:00.445 --> 39:03.615
I run the whole show
running through my hands.

39:03.648 --> 39:06.251
It's a lot of responsibility,

39:06.284 --> 39:08.686
and I take it very,
very seriously.

39:08.719 --> 39:10.655
Thirdly, you come
all the way up here

39:10.688 --> 39:11.690
just to tell me
that you don't have

39:11.722 --> 39:13.491
any specific sound cues in mind?

39:14.425 --> 39:15.594
What's the second thing?

39:15.626 --> 39:16.829
Excuse me?

39:16.862 --> 39:20.865
You said, "first of
all," and "thirdly,"

39:20.898 --> 39:22.333
but you forgot the second thing.

39:22.367 --> 39:26.339
It was the thing
about the, uh,

39:27.505 --> 39:29.274
clearly you weren't
paying attention,

39:29.307 --> 39:30.708
which is my point.

39:30.742 --> 39:34.680
Stop wasting my time, and
let me get back to work.

39:34.713 --> 39:35.614
Okay.

39:35.646 --> 39:36.849
You know, I was told to come by

39:36.882 --> 39:39.385
and check in with
you, regardless, so.

39:39.418 --> 39:42.621
Oh, I'll be talking with Andy
about this, don't you worry.

39:42.653 --> 39:44.289
I won't.

39:44.322 --> 39:46.491
I feel very confident knowing
the show is in your hands.

40:00.405 --> 40:01.707
Thanks.

40:01.739 --> 40:02.707
Really needed that.

40:05.110 --> 40:06.378
Would you like a drink?

40:09.681 --> 40:10.983
Sure, why not?

40:17.521 --> 40:18.724
What are you working on?

40:21.059 --> 40:23.762
It's a
play I'm writing.

40:23.795 --> 40:25.431
You write?

40:25.463 --> 40:26.298
That's great.

40:28.467 --> 40:32.405
Is it a comedy like,
Moliere, was it?

40:34.139 --> 40:35.774
Good memory.

40:35.806 --> 40:37.942
Not exactly, no.

40:37.976 --> 40:38.844
What's it about?

40:39.978 --> 40:41.880
It's called Contrapasso.

40:43.014 --> 40:44.750
Contrapasso?

40:44.782 --> 40:46.351
It's from Dante's Inferno.

40:47.251 --> 40:50.822
It refers to the relationship
between one's sins

40:50.856 --> 40:54.360
and their corresponding
punishment in hell.

40:56.161 --> 40:58.331
The punishment
must fit the crime.

40:59.130 --> 41:00.865
That's basically it, yes.

41:02.067 --> 41:03.469
Is the story personal?

41:04.570 --> 41:07.573
We all have crimes we
want to atone for, don't we?

41:13.677 --> 41:16.114
Hey, have you seen
or heard anything

41:16.148 --> 41:17.350
weird around here?

41:18.650 --> 41:20.085
Such as?

41:20.117 --> 41:24.389
Well, I heard this
theater has some history.

41:26.557 --> 41:28.494
Tragic history.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.695
All theaters have
history, Myles.

41:30.728 --> 41:33.431
Perhaps you should focus
on your show tonight.

41:33.465 --> 41:35.401
Doors will open in 45 minutes.

41:47.045 --> 41:49.414
Try to stay out
of trouble, okay?

42:02.927 --> 42:03.762
Jared?

42:06.565 --> 42:07.566
Is the jacket ready?

42:29.554 --> 42:30.756
Jared?

43:36.588 --> 43:38.190
Hey.

43:38.222 --> 43:39.291
Hey there.

43:39.324 --> 43:40.626
Where's Jared?

43:42.193 --> 43:44.096
He wasn't in here
when I showed up.

43:44.128 --> 43:47.532
He said he'd have a jacket
for me for the show tonight.

43:47.565 --> 43:49.268
When did he say that?

43:49.300 --> 43:50.134
Earlier.

43:53.304 --> 43:54.906
No!

43:54.940 --> 43:56.807
I mean, he's not in there.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.610
I was just using that to change.

44:00.344 --> 44:01.646
I told him to go talk to Donna

44:01.679 --> 44:02.815
and he never showed up.

44:03.981 --> 44:05.951
I'm sure he'll
follow up with her eventually.

44:06.952 --> 44:08.287
What's this?

44:08.320 --> 44:10.055
It's mine.

44:10.088 --> 44:10.990
What is it?

44:12.289 --> 44:13.724
Medication.

44:13.757 --> 44:15.826
Medication, seriously?

44:15.860 --> 44:16.929
Yes, seriously.

44:20.632 --> 44:22.534
What do you have?

44:26.137 --> 44:29.041
You said this place
had some tragic history.

44:29.074 --> 44:29.942
Yeah?

44:29.974 --> 44:30.976
I wanna know more.

44:32.177 --> 44:33.012
Okay.

44:34.746 --> 44:36.548
Let me take care
of something first.

44:37.815 --> 44:39.650
Meet me in the basement.

45:07.277 --> 45:08.946
I like what
you've done with the place.

45:08.980 --> 45:12.717
This is supposed to
be where it all began.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.119
Where what began?

45:14.152 --> 45:17.655
In the early days, the
theater employed company actors.

45:17.688 --> 45:21.125
The main actor and actress
had been together for years.

45:21.159 --> 45:22.760
They even had a child.

45:22.793 --> 45:25.396
And people would come from
all around to see them

45:25.429 --> 45:30.635
because they were so
magnetic and wonderful,

45:31.702 --> 45:34.038
but that came with a price.

45:34.072 --> 45:36.407
One of the theater
patrons, a widow,

45:36.440 --> 45:41.379
immensely wealthy, fell
in love with the actor.

45:41.413 --> 45:42.681
So is she the ghost?

45:42.713 --> 45:44.248
The widow, no.

45:44.282 --> 45:46.218
The actress is
the ghost, then.

45:46.251 --> 45:48.153
Maybe, shut up and listen.

45:49.788 --> 45:53.992
The actor decided to marry
this widow for her money,

45:54.025 --> 45:57.663
and he wanted his
girlfriend, the actress,

45:57.695 --> 45:59.730
to be his mistress,
and he would care

45:59.764 --> 46:01.900
for her and the
kids financially.

46:01.932 --> 46:03.869
That's pretty
generous, actually.

46:03.902 --> 46:06.338
The actress didn't
see it that way.

46:06.371 --> 46:11.309
She felt betrayed,
she wanted revenge.

46:12.342 --> 46:13.744
So...

46:13.777 --> 46:15.079
She killed the
kid and sent the body

46:15.112 --> 46:17.081
up on the stage during
the performance.

46:17.114 --> 46:18.817
Dude, you ruined it!

46:18.849 --> 46:21.786
Yeah, this horrific story
is totally ruined now.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.455
Yeah, sorry to gave
away the ending, guys.

46:23.487 --> 46:26.257
I was setting it up
so beautifully, too.

46:26.291 --> 46:28.727
So who is this ghost, the kid?

46:28.760 --> 46:30.128
Oh come on, it's all BS.

46:30.161 --> 46:31.363
Look, haven't you ever noticed

46:31.396 --> 46:33.365
it sounds an awful
lot like Medea?

46:33.398 --> 46:35.333
Like Medea's Family Reunion?

46:35.365 --> 46:37.402
Dude, it's a
fucking Greek tragedy.

46:37.434 --> 46:38.936
I thought it was
a guy making jokes,

46:38.969 --> 46:40.771
dressed up like
somebody's grandma.

46:40.804 --> 46:42.473
- I should watch those movies.
- No, oh my God.

46:42.507 --> 46:45.744
You can at least admit,
there's an uncanny resemblance.

46:45.777 --> 46:48.480
Life imitates art.

46:48.512 --> 46:50.114
I think you've
got that backwards.

46:50.148 --> 46:52.350
Okay, so in this supposedly
fake, maybe true, story,

46:52.382 --> 46:53.951
what happens next?

46:53.985 --> 46:56.054
Well, that's the best part.

46:56.086 --> 46:58.489
The actor was in the
middle of his performance,

46:58.523 --> 47:03.162
and when he saw the
body, he just snapped.

47:04.795 --> 47:09.701
He started laughing, and
he never stopped.

47:10.768 --> 47:11.969
Not ever?

47:12.003 --> 47:13.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they
evacuated the theater,

47:13.972 --> 47:16.508
and the actress accidentally
locked herself down here.

47:16.541 --> 47:18.276
So who is the goddamn ghost?

47:18.309 --> 47:20.379
It's the actress, obviously.

47:21.813 --> 47:23.115
Tots obs, guys.

47:23.148 --> 47:25.851
Also obvious why a ghost
would hurt a human.

47:25.884 --> 47:29.487
It's like you've never
read a book or seen a movie.

47:29.521 --> 47:30.956
It's kind of sad.

47:32.222 --> 47:34.793
Okay, aren't
ghosts non-corporeal?

47:34.826 --> 47:36.528
Oh, so you're a
ghost hunter now?

47:36.561 --> 47:38.864
Did I miss your two am
show on basic cable?

47:38.896 --> 47:40.998
There are different
kinds of ghosts.

47:41.032 --> 47:41.833
Don't take it personally.

47:41.865 --> 47:43.367
She's always like this.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.869
Different kinds of ghosts?

47:44.902 --> 47:48.873
Yeah, like
poltergeists or phantoms.

47:48.907 --> 47:50.242
Of the opera?

47:50.275 --> 47:51.943
You guys are stupid.

47:51.976 --> 47:54.211
All I'm saying is that
unexplained deaths

47:54.244 --> 47:56.080
have happened in this theater,

47:56.114 --> 47:57.349
and, when they've happened,

47:57.382 --> 48:00.085
they've blamed it
on Laughing Linda.

48:00.117 --> 48:01.286
Laughing Linda?

48:01.318 --> 48:02.487
That's a horrible name.

48:02.519 --> 48:03.420
I didn't name her.

48:03.454 --> 48:04.890
Why is she Laughing Linda?

48:04.922 --> 48:06.490
Wasn't he the one who
didn't stop laughing?

48:06.523 --> 48:09.027
Shouldn't he be Laughing Larry?

48:09.059 --> 48:10.895
His name was Clifton.

48:10.929 --> 48:11.997
I think you're
missing the point.

48:12.030 --> 48:14.932
Actually, I think you're
both missing the point.

48:14.965 --> 48:16.902
This story is stupid, Bethany.

48:16.934 --> 48:17.768
Yeah, Bethany.

48:17.802 --> 48:19.904
You're the one who
asked to hear it.

48:26.110 --> 48:27.878
Don't worry about her, she
loves this kind of stuff.

48:27.911 --> 48:29.446
She would kill for
something horrible to happen

48:29.480 --> 48:30.414
while she was here.

48:31.615 --> 48:33.184
Come on, I gotta lock the door.

48:47.965 --> 48:48.800
Shit!

48:53.972 --> 48:54.573
Fuck!

49:05.148 --> 49:05.983
Ants!

49:08.018 --> 49:09.253
Andy, do you copy?

49:09.286 --> 49:12.156
Andy, something
spilled on the mixer.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.195
Cocksucker!

49:33.677 --> 49:36.080
- Donna's?
- It could've been.

49:36.114 --> 49:37.215
Are you ignoring me?

49:38.181 --> 49:38.983
No.

49:39.016 --> 49:40.284
Where is everybody?

49:40.318 --> 49:41.119
Everybody who?

49:41.152 --> 49:42.621
Everybody!

49:42.653 --> 49:45.257
Okay, Bryce, you know it's
a skeleton crew tonight.

49:45.289 --> 49:46.657
We're not putting on King Lear.

49:46.690 --> 49:48.359
Did you try your radio?

49:48.393 --> 49:51.362
Dude, I've been telling
you, my radio's broken,

49:51.396 --> 49:53.231
and it's not like
anyone else around here

49:53.264 --> 49:55.300
uses their radio.

49:55.333 --> 49:56.501
He's right, half
the time I end

49:56.534 --> 49:59.237
up yelling into my headset at
someone who's not even there.

49:59.269 --> 50:01.005
I look like a total douche bag.

50:01.039 --> 50:03.909
And that, dear Andy,
is why I don't use mine.

50:03.942 --> 50:05.644
You're lucky you
barely volunteer.

50:05.677 --> 50:07.345
Yeah, I'm real lucky.

50:07.378 --> 50:08.680
Hello!

50:08.713 --> 50:10.315
Can I help
you with something?

50:10.347 --> 50:11.250
I might have...

50:13.351 --> 50:14.986
Do we have any backup
mixers somewhere?

50:15.018 --> 50:16.020
Why?

50:16.054 --> 50:16.889
Well, do we?

50:18.056 --> 50:19.023
Yeah, probably.

50:19.958 --> 50:20.592
The basement?

50:22.960 --> 50:26.997
Hey, heads up, new
lock on the door.

50:27.030 --> 50:29.433
Have fun, don't let
Laughing Linda get you.

50:33.371 --> 50:35.606
He believes in it,
too, you know he does.

50:35.639 --> 50:37.241
Fuck, goddamn it.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.188
Hello!

51:24.222 --> 51:26.257
I'm down here!

51:30.293 --> 51:32.163
Andy, quit fucking around.

51:33.398 --> 51:34.766
What the fuck?

51:34.798 --> 51:36.768
Some sort of Laughing
Linda bullshit, Bethany?

51:36.800 --> 51:39.003
It's a good prank,
but cut it out.

52:38.695 --> 52:39.498
Isabella.

52:40.364 --> 52:41.199
Miss Hooper.

52:42.632 --> 52:45.069
Hi, Miss Hooper, I'm Nelson
Fritch, I'm Myles' agent.

52:45.103 --> 52:46.637
Yes, I know, I remember.

52:46.670 --> 52:48.239
Thank you so much for
coming to the show tonight.

52:48.271 --> 52:50.407
He is really excited
to have you here.

52:50.440 --> 52:51.608
I really appreciate it.

52:51.641 --> 52:52.844
Can I meet him
before the show?

52:52.876 --> 52:54.778
I'd like to wish him luck.

52:54.811 --> 52:56.681
Sure, absolutely, follow me.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.261
Bryce.

54:25.469 --> 54:27.539
They're gonna come and find you.

54:27.572 --> 54:29.240
Right after the show,
the cops will get

54:29.273 --> 54:30.508
an anonymous call, they're
gonna come and get you,

54:30.541 --> 54:32.177
you son of a bitch!

54:50.961 --> 54:52.197
Not now!

54:54.599 --> 54:57.434
Hey, Myles, this
is Isabella Hooper.

54:58.603 --> 54:59.938
Pleased to meet
you, Mr. Parks.

55:02.440 --> 55:04.208
You seem to have gotten
something on your shirt.

55:04.242 --> 55:08.947
Oh, well, just
trying my best here.

55:13.251 --> 55:14.286
What?

55:15.452 --> 55:17.355
You're just not
what I expected.

55:19.623 --> 55:24.195
Well, some performers
just have a crazy process.

55:27.664 --> 55:30.867
So true, so true.

55:30.900 --> 55:31.969
Crazy process.

55:32.003 --> 55:34.639
Well, good luck tonight, Myles.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.509
I guess we'll see
if this pans out.

55:51.322 --> 55:52.390
Myles.

55:53.690 --> 55:54.491
Hi, Donna.

55:59.297 --> 55:59.998
Everything okay?

56:00.030 --> 56:01.233
It's nothing.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.436
It's almost showtime for you.

56:06.369 --> 56:07.871
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

56:12.476 --> 56:14.613
The ownership is
selling the theater.

56:17.648 --> 56:18.483
Oh.

56:20.784 --> 56:22.420
I'm sorry to hear that.

56:22.452 --> 56:24.355
I really shouldn't
be surprised.

56:25.322 --> 56:27.658
They never appreciated
this place, not like I did.

56:29.059 --> 56:31.895
This theater is everything
that I have always wanted.

56:33.030 --> 56:35.333
Maybe the new owners
will keep you on.

56:35.365 --> 56:37.367
Oh, Myles, they're
gonna tear it down.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.971
It's probably gonna be a
condominium or parking lot.

56:41.905 --> 56:43.340
That's terrible, I'm sorry.

56:44.307 --> 56:45.742
You know, I shouldn't
burden you with this.

56:45.775 --> 56:47.411
It's extremely unprofessional.

56:47.445 --> 56:49.314
Is there something
I can help you with?

56:52.650 --> 56:54.052
I got a stain on my shirt.

56:55.452 --> 56:59.356
Oh, what?

57:00.590 --> 57:01.425
This?

57:12.836 --> 57:14.672
I wish I could help.

57:17.507 --> 57:18.576
You're very sweet.

57:21.378 --> 57:23.347
I'm sorry I was
condescending earlier.

57:24.782 --> 57:28.353
I think I was worried that
this show would be the last,

57:29.452 --> 57:30.521
and I took it out on you.

57:33.023 --> 57:36.594
I hope this show helps
you find success.

57:38.061 --> 57:38.896
You deserve it.

57:41.164 --> 57:42.634
You're a good man, Myles.

57:44.135 --> 57:48.573
You deserve everything I
am sure is coming to you.

57:50.807 --> 57:51.643
I hope not.

58:13.597 --> 58:15.367
WTF, Bryce,
where are you?

58:20.838 --> 58:22.974
Hey, have you seen Bryce?

58:24.141 --> 58:25.476
No, not since
he barged through

58:25.509 --> 58:26.711
the hallway in a hissy fit.

58:26.744 --> 58:28.012
He's not answering his radio.

58:28.045 --> 58:29.514
We need music out
there, and I don't think

58:29.547 --> 58:31.014
anybody's manning
the control booth.

58:31.047 --> 58:33.417
Well, I can't man
the control booth,

58:33.451 --> 58:34.952
but I can woman it.

58:36.085 --> 58:37.821
Even better,
thank you so much.

58:37.855 --> 58:38.822
- Seriously.
- Yep.

58:44.695 --> 58:48.199
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

58:48.231 --> 58:49.534
We got this.

58:49.567 --> 58:51.702
We're not putting
on King Lear, right?

58:51.735 --> 58:53.471
Yeah, thanks, Bethany.

58:55.873 --> 58:58.543
Hey, you know that I've
always dug you, right?

58:58.576 --> 59:02.713
Dug, did you just say
that you've always dug me?

59:02.746 --> 59:04.449
I don't know, it
just kinda slipped out.

59:04.481 --> 59:06.451
- Sorry if I...
- Hey, it's okay.

59:07.684 --> 59:08.820
I already know.

59:09.987 --> 59:12.456
Would you want to
go out for drinks

59:12.489 --> 59:13.223
after this, maybe?

59:13.257 --> 59:14.192
I don't drink.

59:14.224 --> 59:15.992
Oh, okay, yeah.

59:16.025 --> 59:21.031
But we can get high
in my car if you want.

59:22.132 --> 59:24.969
Yeah, that sounds nice.

59:25.001 --> 59:26.204
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:26.237 --> 59:27.538
Okay.

59:27.570 --> 59:28.940
- Okay, cool.
- Cool.

59:28.972 --> 59:30.474
I'll see you after the show.

59:30.507 --> 59:31.107
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:31.141 --> 59:32.543
Yeah.

59:50.994 --> 59:52.996
Did I see
what I think I saw?

59:53.864 --> 59:55.566
Is that a tongue twister?

59:55.599 --> 59:56.700
What?

59:56.733 --> 59:59.237
You know, to help you
prepare, loosen up the tongue.

59:59.269 --> 01:00:01.105
I always say, I'm
not the fig plucker,

01:00:01.137 --> 01:00:03.039
nor the fig plucker's
son, but I'll pluck figs

01:00:03.072 --> 01:00:04.942
til the fig plucker comes.

01:00:04.974 --> 01:00:08.112
See, it's funny 'cause you
end up saying "pig fucker."

01:00:08.144 --> 01:00:09.547
Cut the shit.

01:00:09.579 --> 01:00:12.016
I saw Isabella Hooper
with your agent.

01:00:12.048 --> 01:00:13.518
How'd you get her here, huh?

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:15.018
She's here to see you?

01:00:15.052 --> 01:00:17.054
She's here to give me
a spot on the Daily Dish.

01:00:17.086 --> 01:00:18.155
Oh yeah?

01:00:18.188 --> 01:00:21.559
And when I upstage you,
how's that gonna play out?

01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:23.594
Well, she's here looking
for stand-up comedians,

01:00:23.626 --> 01:00:25.228
so I'm not all that worried.

01:00:25.262 --> 01:00:26.564
I am a comedian!

01:00:26.597 --> 01:00:28.666
No, you were a comedian until

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:29.800
you sold out to make a bunch

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:31.903
of shitty, big
budget, family movies

01:00:31.936 --> 01:00:34.305
that are painfully unfunny.

01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:36.274
Meanwhile, you cash big
ass checks with sums

01:00:36.306 --> 01:00:38.542
that you think somehow
correlate to your talent

01:00:38.576 --> 01:00:41.112
and can't figure out
why everyone else

01:00:41.144 --> 01:00:43.047
thinks you're washed
up and depressing.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.317
Well, good luck on
your victory tour.

01:00:47.351 --> 01:00:49.053
The audience might
be disappointed,

01:00:49.085 --> 01:00:50.721
but maybe you can
convince yourself,

01:00:50.753 --> 01:00:53.590
with one last check,
that you've still got it.

01:00:53.623 --> 01:00:55.292
You're a piece of shit.

01:00:55.326 --> 01:00:58.663
There is such a thing as
comedy karma, you know.

01:00:58.695 --> 01:01:00.664
Clearly, you would know.

01:01:00.697 --> 01:01:02.666
Fuck you, Myles!

01:01:02.699 --> 01:01:03.900
Fuck you!

01:01:09.672 --> 01:01:10.674
Donna?

01:01:14.612 --> 01:01:15.313
Hello.

01:01:15.346 --> 01:01:16.981
We are ready to go out there.

01:01:24.989 --> 01:01:26.222
Donna?

01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:51.182
Hey, look, Donna, I'm
sorry to disturb you,

01:01:51.215 --> 01:01:53.617
but I think we're about ready
to get started out there.

01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:03.126
Ew.

01:02:16.072 --> 01:02:17.340
Bethany here.

01:02:17.373 --> 01:02:19.976
I found Bryce's headset.

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.147
Queuing music now.

01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:35.826
Shit.

01:03:09.193 --> 01:03:10.461
Bryce.

01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:11.329
Hey, moron.

01:03:33.382 --> 01:03:35.385
My work here is done,

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.089
Handy Andy.

01:03:55.838 --> 01:03:57.842
Nelson, listen...

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.443
I don't wanna talk to
you right now, Myles.

01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:01.745
Excuse me?

01:04:01.778 --> 01:04:04.380
You're acting
crazy with Isabella.

01:04:04.414 --> 01:04:05.816
I don't need this.

01:04:05.849 --> 01:04:08.085
Isn't this how you
wanted me, more edgy?

01:04:08.117 --> 01:04:10.253
I'm funnier when I'm
an asshole, right?

01:04:10.286 --> 01:04:11.821
You're not just
being an asshole.

01:04:11.855 --> 01:04:12.655
I don't know what this is.

01:04:12.688 --> 01:04:13.923
I've never seen you
like this before.

01:04:13.956 --> 01:04:14.858
What's going on?

01:04:14.891 --> 01:04:16.393
So now you wanna listen to me?

01:04:16.425 --> 01:04:18.194
Don't you wanna tell me
how it's just my nerves?

01:04:18.228 --> 01:04:19.764
Fuck you, okay?

01:04:19.797 --> 01:04:21.432
I'm doing everything I can here

01:04:21.465 --> 01:04:23.834
to set you up for success.

01:04:23.867 --> 01:04:26.437
You're talented, I
think you're talented.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:29.773
I just want them to know, too.

01:04:29.806 --> 01:04:32.041
So it's all for me, right,
you get nothing out of this?

01:04:32.074 --> 01:04:33.243
What
is wrong with you?

01:04:33.277 --> 01:04:35.846
You know what, I
took my pills, Nelson.

01:04:35.878 --> 01:04:36.980
I took them.

01:04:37.014 --> 01:04:38.782
They didn't help.

01:04:38.815 --> 01:04:40.817
But at least you don't
have to worry about me.

01:04:40.851 --> 01:04:41.885
I'm still an asshole...

01:04:41.918 --> 01:04:43.153
I gave you sugar pills!

01:04:49.025 --> 01:04:50.027
I switched them out.

01:04:51.228 --> 01:04:52.363
I took the bottle.

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:56.333
I thought, if you
didn't take them

01:04:56.365 --> 01:04:58.369
for a few hours,
it'd be no big deal.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.039
Okay, you wanna know
what's really going on?

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.807
You think you can handle it?

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.509
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes for our big night.

01:05:06.543 --> 01:05:07.878
Are you?

01:05:20.923 --> 01:05:21.793
It was here.

01:05:22.893 --> 01:05:23.594
No, it wasn't, Myles.

01:05:23.626 --> 01:05:25.096
You don't understand.

01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:27.864
I might, try me.

01:05:27.898 --> 01:05:30.934
I know you think this is
about Mia, but it's not.

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:33.136
Let's not talk about
that right now, okay?

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:35.405
You're going on in 15 minutes.

01:05:36.373 --> 01:05:37.809
Well, I'll try my best.

01:05:38.909 --> 01:05:40.244
I was trying to help you.

01:05:42.278 --> 01:05:44.014
You understand that, right?

01:05:44.047 --> 01:05:46.983
Look, whatever shit you've
done, I've done way worse.

01:05:49.585 --> 01:05:50.887
I could use a drink.

01:05:52.188 --> 01:05:53.389
Talk to Donna.

01:05:53.422 --> 01:05:54.625
I'm sure she'd be
happy to share.

01:05:54.657 --> 01:05:56.259
All right.

01:05:56.293 --> 01:05:57.995
I think we both could use one.

01:05:58.661 --> 01:06:00.096
I'm good, you go ahead.

01:06:04.134 --> 01:06:06.170
All right, I'll see
you after the show.

01:06:07.237 --> 01:06:08.072
Good luck, Myles.

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:21.918
Hello?

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:24.487
Donna?

01:07:32.054 --> 01:07:36.059
Myles,
Myles, who did this, Myles?

01:07:36.092 --> 01:07:37.126
Myles.

01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:38.689
Oh my God.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:24.801
Fuck you.

01:13:29.546 --> 01:13:30.681
No!

01:13:42.891 --> 01:13:46.496
I'm serious, Myles, you
better not fuck this up!

01:13:46.529 --> 01:13:48.032
I'm the headliner!

01:13:50.033 --> 01:13:52.436
Oh, my fucking career's over.

01:14:17.961 --> 01:14:20.664
You killed her.

01:15:36.506 --> 01:15:37.474
Who are you?

01:15:52.921 --> 01:15:53.990
That's funny.

01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:40.136
The best music.

01:16:40.168 --> 01:16:42.204
Hey, radio
lovers, Jay Barilla here.

01:16:42.238 --> 01:16:43.139
Man, the story
breaking this morning

01:16:43.172 --> 01:16:45.509
about the tragedy at
the Reggie Ray show.

01:16:45.542 --> 01:16:47.210
Can you believe this?

01:16:47.243 --> 01:16:49.145
Last night, around the
time the show was starting,

01:16:49.177 --> 01:16:51.046
the curtains parted to
reveal the opening act,

01:16:51.079 --> 01:16:53.649
Myles Parks, murdered
on the stage.

01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:56.552
By the way, had anybody heard

01:16:56.586 --> 01:16:58.255
of this Myles Parks guy before?

01:16:58.287 --> 01:16:59.622
I hadn't, so I looked him up,

01:16:59.655 --> 01:17:03.260
and he has, had, real talent.

01:17:03.292 --> 01:17:04.860
Ever since the news
of his murder broke,

01:17:04.894 --> 01:17:07.264
this video on YouTube
of a performance of his

01:17:07.296 --> 01:17:10.299
at a Portland nightclub in
2015 has been blowing up.

01:17:10.332 --> 01:17:14.537
This guy is, was,
really, really funny.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:17.207
His video is, let me see here,

01:17:17.239 --> 01:17:20.609
wow, it's up to two
million views and climbing.

01:17:20.643 --> 01:17:23.012
If you get a chance to check
it out, don't hesitate.

01:17:23.046 --> 01:17:24.280
This is one of the funniest sets

01:17:24.314 --> 01:17:25.715
I've seen in a long time.

01:17:25.747 --> 01:17:27.650
It's funnier than
anything Reggie Ray

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:30.052
has done in decades, I
can tell you that much.

01:17:30.086 --> 01:17:31.320
Anyway, the official
word is that there

01:17:31.354 --> 01:17:33.990
may be more victims in
last night's tragedy,

01:17:34.023 --> 01:17:35.324
but the police are
keeping a tight lid

01:17:35.358 --> 01:17:37.293
on the story at the moment.

01:17:37.327 --> 01:17:38.595
Okay, back to some music.

01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:40.329
This next song is
called Short Night

01:17:40.363 --> 01:17:42.666
by the band Glass Dolls.

01:17:42.698 --> 01:17:44.333
Stay safe out there, folks.

01:17:44.367 --> 01:17:46.670
There might be a
killer on the loose.
