00:12.596 --> 00:15.182
Maybe.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.315
Full house.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.203
I will give you the part.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.498
That was for a '69 Charger, no?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.417
There. No charges, OK?

01:23.458 --> 01:27.045
Please, just go.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.926
Take me with you.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.181
Sorry, man.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.225
Here, kid.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.784
So, you see, by applying
the basic principles...

02:38.825 --> 02:41.370
of the scientific method to the matter...

02:41.411 --> 02:44.289
we learn very quickly that
the myth of the Chupacabra...

02:44.331 --> 02:47.084
is just that... utter crap.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.878
Now, if you apply these same
principles to Catholicism...

02:49.920 --> 02:51.505
an interesting thing occurs.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.966
Yes?

02:58.762 --> 03:06.854
"English for immigrants"
is in el proximo cuarto, numero 206.

03:08.355 --> 03:13.569
So, anyone else have a question?

03:14.570 --> 03:16.196
OK, then.

03:16.238 --> 03:21.368
Well, I hope my lecture has been as
enlightening for all of you as it has for me.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.996
Really, you've all been... great.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.832
Interesting lecture as always, Dr. Venture.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.418
I am only sorry there wasn't
a better turnout.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.754
It's difficult to hold the students' attention
during Dia de los Muertos.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.674
Oh, right... the crazy dead-people Christmas
you people celebrate.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.092
What, is that supposed to be today?

03:37.134 --> 03:38.594
Si.

03:38.635 --> 03:42.848
Oh, great. Fantastic of you to tell me that
before I came all the way down here.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.517
So, how do we do this?

03:45.559 --> 03:51.732
Do you guys mail me a check, or do I
pick it up at the bursar's office or what?

03:51.773 --> 03:54.151
Hey, doc.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.570
How'd your speech thing go?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.113
All right, I suppose.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.908
One or two of the students really
seemed to grasp...

04:00.949 --> 04:03.535
you don't really care, do you?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.288
Hola, Senor Samson.

04:06.330 --> 04:10.250
See you back at the X-1
in a couple of hours.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.045
- Hey, Pop!
- Boys.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.880
This place is tits!
Divvy this.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.716
- We got these boss Mexican hats...
- Sombreros!

04:17.757 --> 04:20.719
And these super-cool sugar skulls
with our names on them.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.263
Ah, there you are.
Your check, Dr. Venture.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.848
Muchas gracias.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.183
Super good.

04:26.225 --> 04:29.186
Very generous of y... oh, pesos.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.813
Great. These zeroes
are all meaningless.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.399
Damn it. You people have
giant bugs around here.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.777
Ah, that is the monarch butterfly.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.029
They migrate here to Mexico
this time of year.

04:39.071 --> 04:43.242
The Aztecs believed they were the spirits of
the dead returning home.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.661
Wow, but you're full
of helpful information, fella!

04:45.702 --> 04:47.037
And how!

04:47.079 --> 04:49.498
Say, it's not poisonous, is it?

04:49.540 --> 04:51.917
I... You're kidding, right?

04:51.959 --> 04:56.547
No, hijo, he's not poisonous.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.632
That's where you're wrong, Mr. College.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.133
Honey, what are you going on about?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.803
Don't call me that in front of the henchmen.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.263
Keep it professional.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.890
It's my old nemesis, Dr. Venture.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.268
He's obviously followed us down here.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.646
Someone must have leaked
our whereabouts to him, but who?

05:12.688 --> 05:18.485
All right. Which one of you
sold the Monarch out?

05:18.527 --> 05:21.029
I'm going to turn around
and close my eyes...

05:21.071 --> 05:23.574
and I want the guilty party to step forward.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.617
No judgments.
You won't be punished.

05:25.659 --> 05:30.789
Just want to know who did it, OK?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.207
Traitor!

05:32.249 --> 05:34.543
Dirty bastard traitor!
I knew it was you, number...

05:34.585 --> 05:36.795
- 37.
- Number 37!

05:36.837 --> 05:39.339
Strike him from the roster,
Dr. Girlfriend.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.466
- Speedy!
- Yes, Monarch.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.093
You're being promoted.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.970
I want you and a phalanx
of no less than three...

05:45.012 --> 05:48.182
and no more than five henchmen
to go and observe Dr. Venture.

05:48.223 --> 05:52.269
Find out what he's doing here
and whether or not he knows about my...

05:52.311 --> 05:53.979
sinister plan.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.481
- Does this mean I'm getting my wings?
- No.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.150
I'm never gonna get those wings.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.986
Someday, Speedy, someday.

06:01.028 --> 06:07.576
Here. How about I let you
drive the Monarch-mobile?

06:07.618 --> 06:09.453
Horrible disease-carrying things.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.788
But that might have been
someone's spirit, Pop.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.665
All the more reason to get it the hell off me.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.793
Look, don't you kids
have someplace to be or something?

06:16.835 --> 06:19.213
Well, here! Go... I don't know,
buy fireworks or something.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.340
Just go somewhere that's
not next to your father.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.177
I have urgent business to attend to
with a colleague of mine, Dr. Guevara...

06:25.219 --> 06:28.597
the top man in his field.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.349
I am sorry, Senor Venture.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.600
- Doctor.
- Si?

06:31.642 --> 06:35.187
No, Dr. Venture.
What's Mexican for doctor?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.730
Doctor.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.525
As I was saying, I simply cannot
write you these prescriptions.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.817
What? Why not?

06:40.859 --> 06:43.362
The quantities you have specified are
practically criminal.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.281
You have drugs on this list
with completely opposite applications...

06:46.323 --> 06:47.908
you have none of the ailments they treat...

06:47.950 --> 06:49.993
But I have tripolar disorder.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.704
- No.
- Oh, come on. Look at this place!

06:52.746 --> 06:55.916
I realize I am a Tijuana doctor and all,
but even we have scruples.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.961
I could lose my license to
practice Mexican medicine.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.339
OK. I see how it is.

07:02.381 --> 07:07.386
And what would you prescribe
for Alexander Hamilton?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.179
- Not much.
- OK.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.556
How about if, say...

07:10.597 --> 07:16.979
President Benjamin Franklin
were to ask you?

07:18.313 --> 07:19.940
Hey, I've been thinking.

07:19.982 --> 07:23.277
Maybe instead of being super selfish
with the money Dad gave us...

07:23.318 --> 07:25.112
we should try to do
something good with it.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.531
Aw, crud. Like what, brown-noser?

07:27.573 --> 07:30.158
Well, take a look
at old H.E.L.P.eR. There.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.493
He's pretty beat up, don't you think?

07:31.535 --> 07:32.953
Well, sure. He looks like...

07:32.995 --> 07:35.664
a dried-out turd
on a bad stretch of road. Why?

07:35.706 --> 07:38.208
Hasn't H.E.L.P.eR.
Always been there for us?

07:38.250 --> 07:41.753
Hasn't he always been,
well, super helpful?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.130
Sure, he's great.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.091
Well, do you see what I see?

07:46.133 --> 07:50.971
So you want to buy him car paint?

07:51.013 --> 07:55.309
Leave the thinking to me, Albert Ein-steen.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.518
Let's get 'em!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.478
What? Whoa. No. That's not the plan.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.397
Boss just wants us
to observe Dr. Venture.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.691
He's been trying to get
that bastard for years...

08:02.733 --> 08:05.444
and what better way
than to kidnap his kids?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.447
I'm sure to get my wings if we pull this off.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.201
Bring the Monarch-mobile around.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.827
There they are! Go!

08:13.869 --> 08:17.915
Dad's gonna be so super surprised
when he sees...

08:17.956 --> 08:19.791
Mayday! Mayday!

08:19.833 --> 08:22.252
Why?

08:33.764 --> 08:36.308
Guys, heads up.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.852
We got company.

08:52.658 --> 08:57.871
He's got Speedy.
Nail him, boys!

09:05.254 --> 09:07.256
Finally. Jeez.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.884
Come on, Speedy.

09:13.178 --> 09:18.267
Wow. He's really on there good.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.449
Wow. That sucked.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.121
What were you thinking?

09:39.162 --> 09:42.249
Bringing them here?
Who told you to do that?

09:42.291 --> 09:45.294
Well, we thought that...

09:45.335 --> 09:46.628
Actually, it was Speedy's idea.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.297
Great. So it was Speedy's idea.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.842
Super idea, Speedy.
Where is he?

09:51.884 --> 09:54.303
He didn't make it.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.637
What do you mean?

09:55.679 --> 09:58.307
Brock Samson got ahold of him, and he...

09:58.348 --> 10:00.392
Samson. Jeez.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.769
I don't need to hear the rest.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.396
Poor little guy.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.316
He was this close to earning his wings, too.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.694
But see? That's what I'm talking about!

10:10.736 --> 10:12.821
Now Venture will send Samson
after the rest of us...

10:12.863 --> 10:15.073
and he'll go totally
sickhouse on our asses.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.284
I like my ass, gentlemen.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.286
Samson won't be a problem, sir.

10:19.328 --> 10:22.497
You... no way. Is he dead?

10:22.539 --> 10:24.374
Well, this changes everything.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.710
Without his walking Swedish
murder machine...

10:26.752 --> 10:31.548
the good doctor will have to do
just what I say, won't he?

10:31.590 --> 10:34.384
Take them to the holding cell.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.094
Hello. This is Dr. Venture.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.055
Attention, Dr. Thaddeus Venture.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.640
This is the Monarch speaking.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.391
I'm currently unavailable right now...

10:41.433 --> 10:44.102
but if you'd like to leave a message,
you can do so after the beep.

10:44.144 --> 10:48.690
Thanks, and have a scientastic day.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.734
Attention, Dr. Thaddeus Venture.

10:50.776 --> 10:53.695
This is the Monarch speaking.
I have your boys.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.531
If you ever want
to see them alive again...

10:55.572 --> 10:58.367
Damn it!

11:02.788 --> 11:05.082
No!

11:21.098 --> 11:24.101
Oh, for the love of... not again!

11:24.142 --> 11:25.477
Wait a minute.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.105
One...

11:28.146 --> 11:30.566
two.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.945
This is serious.

11:34.987 --> 11:39.199
Brock! Come in, Brock!

11:39.449 --> 11:40.826
Brock, seriously, this is an emergency.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.454
Don't screen me.

11:49.960 --> 11:55.048
Oh, H.E.L.P.eR., thank...
what the hell happened to you?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.551
Yes, yes. Just...

11:57.593 --> 12:00.804
OK. H.E.L.P.eR.

12:00.846 --> 12:05.642
Just get me back to the X-1.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.859
Where are we?

12:13.901 --> 12:17.779
You're supposed to be the super sleuths.
You figure it out.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.490
We're in the belly of the lair
of the Monarch's hideout!

12:20.532 --> 12:22.659
Correct, clever boy.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.952
And with you two in my clutches...

12:23.994 --> 12:26.246
I finally have your father
right where I want him.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.248
What's your problem
with our dad, anyway?

12:28.290 --> 12:32.336
Well, l... he's my nemesis, my archenemy.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.379
I don't think Pop thinks you're
his archenemy.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.673
Come on, I'm sure the walls
of the Venture compound...

12:36.715 --> 12:42.012
are practically caked with the lingering
curses of the Monarch's name.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.597
I've never even heard him mention you.

12:43.639 --> 12:46.308
Hey, I always thought Baron Underbheit
was Dad's archenemy.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.978
Underbheit?
Why, that dime-store Dr. Doom isn't fit to...

12:50.020 --> 12:54.525
just you wait till your father calls me back!

12:54.566 --> 12:57.694
That should just about do it.

12:57.736 --> 13:04.326
Let's see if I'm half the genius I think I am.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.704
Good news. Looks like I am.

13:07.746 --> 13:12.417
H.E.L.P.eR., you are now my personal
walking, talking electric kidney.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.253
Crap.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.880
I'm gonna have to find
a more long-term solution.

13:16.922 --> 13:22.511
H.E.L.P.eR., stay close to me. Come.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.265
Kidney!

13:26.306 --> 13:28.642
"No cure."

13:28.684 --> 13:31.812
"Transplant from a healthy donor
of the same blood type."

13:31.854 --> 13:35.274
Of course! One of the boys.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.069
Where the hell are the boys?

13:39.111 --> 13:45.617
Boys? Hello?
Hank, are you there? Dave? Dean?

13:45.701 --> 13:52.374
Attention, Dr. Thaddeus Venture.
This is the Mo...

13:52.416 --> 13:54.543
Listen. You boys don't have
any special way...

13:54.585 --> 13:56.962
of getting in touch with your dad
I should know about, do you?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.797
I can't seem to get ahold of him.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.301
We usually use our two-way
satellite-linked communicator watches.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.678
No. I tried that already.
He's not answering.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.805
I've left, like, a hundred messages.

14:06.847 --> 14:10.392
Jeez, you'd think he cared
a little more about his kids.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.896
I mean, I'm sure
he's worried sick about you two.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.523
He's probably on his way right now...

14:16.565 --> 14:21.737
with the whole Mexican National Guard
or something.

14:21.778 --> 14:26.074
It's just a little further, H.E.L.P.eR.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.785
What the hell Brock is doing
all the way out here...

14:28.827 --> 14:30.913
when we need him most is beyond me...

14:30.954 --> 14:37.961
but he is going to get
a hot little earful when...

14:46.553 --> 14:50.182
I'm gonna go check on those boys.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.434
- What?
- Nothing.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.311
No. I know that sigh. What?

14:54.353 --> 14:56.480
When we entered this relationship...

14:56.522 --> 15:00.567
we both agreed that we were both people
who did not want kids.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.986
L... what do you expect me to do with them?

15:03.028 --> 15:05.697
I thought their father would show up
in no time.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.116
Do you know he's never even
told them he loves them?

15:08.158 --> 15:09.618
You know what I think?

15:09.660 --> 15:13.956
I think you're trying to compensate
for the loss of your own parents.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.165
You never talk about that.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.542
You want me to talk about it?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.253
Fine. I'll tell you all about
that fateful summer...

15:19.294 --> 15:21.630
the summer of the monarchs.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.841
I was a mere eight years old...

15:23.882 --> 15:26.593
practically a caterpillar
by butterfly standards.

15:26.635 --> 15:30.097
My parents' private jet crashed
in New Jersey's fabled Pine Barrens...

15:30.138 --> 15:32.474
minutes after takeoff from Newark Airport.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.768
Miraculously, I survived.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.979
My parents were not so fortunate.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.856
When I came to, I was surrounded...

15:38.897 --> 15:42.067
by the most enchanting
monarch butterflies.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.236
In time, they took me in
as one of their own.

15:44.278 --> 15:46.196
They became my foster parents.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.323
These were the halcyon days.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.367
I'd play with my butterfly brethren.

15:50.409 --> 15:53.412
I learned the mysterious secrets
of their ancient ways...

15:53.453 --> 15:56.415
supping as their own young do
on a steady diet of milkweed...

15:56.456 --> 15:59.376
thus assuring my toxicity to this day.

15:59.418 --> 16:02.171
Then, one fateful morning in September...

16:02.212 --> 16:04.006
I remember because it was
right around my birthday...

16:04.047 --> 16:07.301
I was ecstatic by autumn's approach
because it meant the leaves of the trees...

16:07.342 --> 16:10.387
would be orange enough for me to build
even more convincing monarch wings.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.431
I awoke and looked
for my monarch family...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.391
but I couldn't find them.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.977
I searched for days, but no sign of them.

16:17.019 --> 16:20.355
It was like losing my parents
all over again...

16:20.397 --> 16:21.899
only much quieter.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.484
So I wandered to the nearest highway,
took the first bus to New York...

16:24.526 --> 16:26.236
and claimed a fat inheritance.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.573
It was only later that I learned that
monarchs migrate south for the winter...

16:29.615 --> 16:32.075
here, to Mexico.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.370
Oh, Tenderoni, that's the only real reason
I've come to Mexico...

16:35.412 --> 16:37.414
to find my foster parents.

16:37.456 --> 16:41.084
My big plan, all that work
I've had you doing...

16:41.126 --> 16:43.629
it was just an excuse.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.464
Do you hate me now?

16:45.506 --> 16:49.551
Oh, Sweetie.
Butterflies only live about nine months.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.094
What?

16:51.136 --> 16:55.015
But those boys downstairs are alive,
and you're right.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.391
They do need a father.

16:56.433 --> 17:04.650
So you go down there and you love
those boys and never let go.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.818
Oh, Brock.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.445
How did this happen?

17:09.488 --> 17:15.077
Where was I when you needed me most?

17:16.537 --> 17:18.914
I know, H.E.L.P.eR.

17:18.955 --> 17:24.962
He was like an angel,
my beautiful guardian angel...

17:25.002 --> 17:29.883
and this is where it got him.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.641
Brock! You're alive!

17:37.683 --> 17:41.812
It worked! My shrine worked!

17:41.854 --> 17:45.065
It's not all superstitious nonsense.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.317
What?

17:47.359 --> 17:49.194
Oh, God, you're a zombie or something.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.780
I never should have played God!

17:51.822 --> 17:56.618
The folly of it! The hubris!

17:59.705 --> 18:01.957
Boys.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.919
Where are the boys?

18:08.881 --> 18:10.048
Double damn it!

18:10.090 --> 18:12.593
Hank, you said the double "D" word.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.761
How are we ever gonna get this gate open?

18:14.803 --> 18:19.183
Which one of my special boys
is in the mood for piping-hot cookies?

18:19.224 --> 18:20.893
Get him!

18:20.934 --> 18:22.477
Oh, so you want to wrestle, eh?

18:22.519 --> 18:24.688
No, you don't.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.982
Nope.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.151
Supposed to be right around here.

18:29.193 --> 18:32.779
He was really specific
in all those messages he left.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.114
Got it.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.533
So, what's the plan?

18:36.575 --> 18:38.368
How long can you live if you're
not hooked up to him?

18:38.410 --> 18:42.206
Oh, I don't know, a couple hours, maybe,
but they'd be very uncomf...

18:42.247 --> 18:44.416
Come on.

18:44.458 --> 18:48.045
H.E.L.P.eR., you drive.
Keep her steady.

18:48.086 --> 18:54.968
- Wait a minute. Where are we...
- Get in my car.

18:57.513 --> 19:01.600
Quit screwing around.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.647
What the hell was that?

19:06.688 --> 19:08.649
Chupacabra. They're all over Mexico.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.401
No way.

19:20.202 --> 19:24.581
You had me scared for a minute there.

19:24.623 --> 19:25.832
Get his legs!

19:25.874 --> 19:28.460
No fair! It's two of you against one.

19:28.502 --> 19:32.422
I don't know if there's enough
Monarch love to go around.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.091
Holy crap!

19:34.132 --> 19:36.093
What is going on here?

19:36.134 --> 19:38.470
Minions! Where are you?

19:38.512 --> 19:41.265
You get the boys.
I'll take care of these guys.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.058
Are you sure?
There's an awful lot of them.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.604
They hit me with a truck.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.277
What's all that noise?

20:35.319 --> 20:36.695
No time for questions, baby.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.822
Fire up the smaller escape cocoon...

20:38.864 --> 20:46.663
ingeniously housed inside
this larger cocoon headquarters!

20:51.585 --> 20:53.170
- Dad!
- Dad!

20:53.212 --> 20:54.671
We knew you wouldn't let us down.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.548
Just in the nick of time, too.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.551
Monarch was getting
all creepy uncle on us.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.553
You're the best dad in the whole world.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.222
Yes, yes.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.975
Go, Team Venture!

21:07.100 --> 21:09.978
And so your father needs for one of you
to donate a kidney...

21:10.020 --> 21:13.857
so that I can keep on living and doing
the "best dad in the world" thing.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.609
But... which one of us, Pop?

21:15.651 --> 21:17.528
Well, I haven't decided yet.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.113
I know. Rock, scissors, paper!

21:20.155 --> 21:26.245
- You're on!
- Once, twice, three, shoot!

21:52.020 --> 21:56.066
What happened?
I thought I had picked rock.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.442
So did I.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.778
And I picked two beautiful kidneys.

21:59.820 --> 22:04.199
I feel freaking amazing.

22:04.616 --> 22:08.328
That's good soup!
