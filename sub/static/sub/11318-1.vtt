01:03:07.244 --> 01:03:10.509
Stanley, you did it!

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.014
Oh, not yet he didn't.

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:14.516
Ha ha ha!

01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:15.949
Touch him.

01:03:16.019 --> 01:03:19.614
Touch him, you little troll.
Touch him!

01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:23.784
Uh!

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.725
Touch him!
Touch him!

01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:56.485
[ Gnorga ]
Aah ha ha ha ha ha!

01:03:58.295 --> 01:04:01.423
It is done.

01:04:01.498 --> 01:04:04.865
Aah! Oh!
Ooh! Oof!.

01:04:08.572 --> 01:04:10.506
[ Thunderclap ]

01:04:10.574 --> 01:04:13.441
Aaahhhh!

01:04:29.092 --> 01:04:30.525
[ Sighs ]

01:04:33.096 --> 01:04:36.031
[Alan ] I felt terrible
about having to run out.

01:04:36.099 --> 01:04:38.226
He was so upset.

01:04:38.301 --> 01:04:40.599
[ Hillary ]Apparently,
he recovered pretty quickly.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.537
Maria said they were both
so quiet all afternoon,

01:04:43.607 --> 01:04:46.098
she hardly knew
they were here.

01:04:53.283 --> 01:04:55.274
That's a little strange.

01:04:56.419 --> 01:04:59.718
I haven't seen hi m
suck his thumb in years.

01:04:59.789 --> 01:05:02.883
Well, we both have been
terribly busy lately.

01:05:02.959 --> 01:05:05.484
Maybe he's feeling
a little insecure.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:15.504
Night-night, my babies.

01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:44.532
Morning.

01:05:44.601 --> 01:05:46.034
Hi, Dad.

01:05:46.102 --> 01:05:48.536
Ah. Who's your friend?

01:05:48.605 --> 01:05:51.540
Oh, your mom
said to tell you

01:05:51.608 --> 01:05:53.542
breakfast is ready.

01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:58.480
Still mad at me
for yesterday.

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:04.987
Well... what
about today, huh?

01:06:05.055 --> 01:06:07.489
You know,
your mother and I

01:06:07.557 --> 01:06:10.993
thought of a few fun
things we could do.

01:06:11.061 --> 01:06:14.360
Dad, do you think
today maybe

01:06:14.431 --> 01:06:17.992
we could do
what I want to do?

01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:27.904
[ Radio ]
And today park officials

01:06:27.978 --> 01:06:31.778
are counting the cost
of clearing up after a freak tornado

01:06:31.848 --> 01:06:36.649
ripped through Central Park,
devastating the entire area.

01:06:48.098 --> 01:06:50.032
[ Crying ]

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.533
Stanley.

01:06:51.601 --> 01:06:53.899
[ Kiss ]

01:07:05.548 --> 01:07:09.245
[ Hillary ]
Gussie! Let's go!

01:07:09.319 --> 01:07:12.482
[ Sighs ]

01:07:12.555 --> 01:07:15.149
Bye, Stanley.

01:07:15.225 --> 01:07:17.216
Bye, Stanley.

01:07:36.179 --> 01:07:38.010
[ Whistle ]

01:07:38.081 --> 01:07:39.446
Stanley?

01:07:39.516 --> 01:07:43.008
# I like to close my eyes #

01:07:43.086 --> 01:07:46.021
# So my heart
can plainly see #

01:07:46.089 --> 01:07:48.887
# Right through
the way things are #

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:52.291
# Clear to the way
they ought to be #

01:07:52.362 --> 01:07:56.526
# To somewhere that's safe
and sunlit and serene #

01:07:56.599 --> 01:08:00.797
# Oh, and absolutely green #

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.804
Hee hee hee hee!

01:08:02.872 --> 01:08:04.362
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

01:08:04.441 --> 01:08:06.966
# Picture a perfect place #

01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:10.240
# Where there is
no doom and gloom #

01:08:10.313 --> 01:08:12.213
# Birds singing
happy songs #

01:08:12.282 --> 01:08:15.911
# And flowers
bursting into bloom #

01:08:15.985 --> 01:08:20.285
# A somewhere like nowhere else
you've ever seen #

01:08:20.356 --> 01:08:24.725
# That's absolutely green #

01:08:24.794 --> 01:08:30.858
# That's how the world
can be if we just want it #

01:08:30.934 --> 01:08:36.930
# Why isn't it that way
do you suppose #

01:08:37.006 --> 01:08:42.876
# Maybe 'cause no one's
concentrating on it #

01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:45.779
#Just give it
love and kindness #

01:08:45.849 --> 01:08:49.046
# See how green it grows #

01:08:49.118 --> 01:08:51.484
# Maybe it's just a dream #

01:08:51.554 --> 01:08:54.819
# But I know
deep in my heart #

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:56.551
# If everyone believed#

01:08:56.626 --> 01:09:00.562
# Believing is
the place to start #

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:03.656
# We could fill everywhere
with flowers #

01:09:03.733 --> 01:09:06.792
# If each of us
used all our powers #

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:12.569
# If we all cared
is what I really mean #

01:09:12.642 --> 01:09:16.169
# We could all live in a world
that's bright and shining #

01:09:16.246 --> 01:09:21.444
# Oh, and absolutely green #

01:09:21.518 --> 01:09:25.453
# We could live in a world
that's bright and shining #

have to attack me?
