that the enemy has had

14:00.757 --> 14:03.510
to resort to espionage
as a counter.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.304
And my opinion,
that's good news.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.515
Thank you, General.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.058
I am pleased
to hear you say that,

14:10.267 --> 14:12.227
and I agree
with you wholeheartedly.

14:12.435 --> 14:16.147
It is indeed
most excellent... news.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.068
I beg your pardon.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.404
Is it not an appropriate moment
in which to comment?

14:22.487 --> 14:25.073
It's quite appropriate.
Please continue.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.784
Not only have the Espheni
resorted to espionage,

14:27.993 --> 14:29.870
as General Porter
has pointed out,

14:29.995 --> 14:31.371
but they have been
forced to deploy

14:31.538 --> 14:33.790
their superior terrain droids,

14:33.957 --> 14:37.544
usually reserved for more
technologically advanced forces.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.338
You have unnerved
the Espheni, sir.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.425
A worthy and unique
accomplishment, I assure you.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.886
But there's been
no decisive battle!

14:46.052 --> 14:47.387
But the Espheni know

14:47.554 --> 14:49.973
and understand
large offensives, General.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.393
What bedevils them
is our consistent skirmishing.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.895
That makes no logical sense.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.188
Well, human logic
is to be discarded

14:57.272 --> 14:59.774
when at war
with extraterrestrial beings.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.698
Well, we still have this
damn mole to deal with,

15:06.865 --> 15:07.949
no matter what.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.910
Ag reed. (CLEARS THROAT)

15:10.076 --> 15:13.121
I suggest that
we appoint Arthur Manchester

15:13.288 --> 15:14.539
to head an investigation.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.749
Seriously?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.112
He's got a head
for these things.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.251
And he's the only one
that didn't have

15:18.335 --> 15:20.335
any prior knowledge
to the planning of the mission.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.089
Thank you, gentlemen.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.341
MAN: Sir.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.770
(BREATHING ERRATICALLY)

15:52.619 --> 15:54.287
I'm glad you came, Hal.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.581
I wasn't sure
you got my message.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.084
Loud and clear.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.187
Hal, I've missed you so much.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.857
I've missed you more than
you could ever imagine.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.572
(GASPS)

16:32.492 --> 16:33.827
Another nightmare?

16:35.912 --> 16:37.789
Do you remember
what it was about?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.835
No.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.714
Well, it's got to be
something to make you

16:45.880 --> 16:47.090
wake up in a cold sweat.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.676
I said I don't remember.
Okay?

16:49.884 --> 16:51.302
Okay.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.434
Maybe you can talk to someone
at the clinic: about it.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.893
I don't need to talk
to anyone about it, okay?

16:59.060 --> 17:01.730
What I need is my wheelchair,

17:01.896 --> 17:03.064
which someone put all the way

17:03.273 --> 17:04.774
on the other damn side
of the room.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.526
(SIGHS)

17:14.284 --> 17:16.619
- What are we doing today?
- Another crazy day.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.039
Citizen's forum in two days?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.248
That's right.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.168
Public works committee?
That's... that's Arthur's.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.253
Not since you put
Dr. Manchester in charge

17:25.378 --> 17:28.381
of this secret investigation
you have going.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.675
I'm sure the rumor is already
out that we have a spy.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.553
They are, so be prepared for
the forum to be less than fun.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.139
- Hello Ben. Denny.
- Got a minute?

17:37.140 --> 17:38.641
Sure I do. What's up?

17:38.672 --> 17:39.952
The leader of the rebel skitters

17:39.976 --> 17:41.102
is requesting
a meeting with you.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.687
Did he say what it was about?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.314
Just that he'd like you to come
to their camp tonight.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.648
He can't come here?

17:46.461 --> 17:48.461
They don't feel comfortable
within the city limits.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.653
'Cause of the anti-skitter talk.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.447
Anti-skitter talk.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.685
Fine.
Tell him Colonel Weaver and I

17:55.742 --> 17:57.583
will come see him tonight
when I get free here.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.204
We'll tell him, Dad.
Thanks.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.580
Professor.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.259
He's doing much better.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.804
I think so.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.223
Yes.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.017
Yeah, I mean, four months ago,
he couldn't move.

18:21.184 --> 18:24.229
Considering that,
he's come a very long way.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.314
And he's got the right attitude,
you know?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.608
He certainly is working hard.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.027
I know.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.947
It's just...

18:34.906 --> 18:36.950
I mean, he's putting up
a good front and all,

18:37.909 --> 18:41.121
but he's been having these
nightmares the past few weeks.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.790
Bad ones.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.667
And he won't tell me
what they are,

18:45.834 --> 18:48.670
but I can tell
they are freaking him out.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.422
Well, like Dr. Glass said,

18:51.506 --> 18:52.924
there's nothing
physically wrong with him.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.801
But something's wrong with him.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.096
Something happened to him.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.599
I think it's something
she did to him.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.643
Karen?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.228
Yeah.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.232
I'm not saying
it's not possible.

19:09.482 --> 19:13.444
But we examined him thoroughly,
as best we can, anyway.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.988
I know.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.739
And we didn't find anything.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.367
I know.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.619
Thank God he's had you

19:21.786 --> 19:23.997
these past seven months,
though, Maggie.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.291
He never would have
made it without you.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.088
Hey, good looking.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.716
You want to dance?

19:45.560 --> 19:46.895
Look, I just want to say,

19:47.145 --> 19:50.982
um, I'm sorry for acting
like such a...

19:51.149 --> 19:52.192
Jerk?

19:53.276 --> 19:54.819
Yeah. That.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.670
All is forgiven.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.424
Get back to work.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.093
Yes, ma'am.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.015
I can't begin
to tell you how pleased

20:24.182 --> 20:26.100
I am that you agreed
to meet with me, Anthony.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.561
Well, I don't know
how much help I can be, sir,

20:28.770 --> 20:31.105
but Professor Mason
did ask me to meet with you,

20:31.314 --> 20:33.358
and, well, here I am meeting.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.711
I'm given to understand
that you worked

20:35.735 --> 20:37.987
for the Boston Police Department
prior to the invasion.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.864
Yes, sir.
Five years in blue,

20:40.031 --> 20:41.241
and five years
undercover narcotics.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.118
- Impressive.
- Thanks, I guess.

20:45.161 --> 20:48.498
We have a situation,
a bad situation.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.584
- You mean with the spy?
- You know about it?

20:51.668 --> 20:53.469
There isn't a soul in Charleston
that doesn't.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.588
And, frankly, people are
pretty upset about it.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.632
Well, I've been tasked

20:57.799 --> 20:59.092
with the job of
investigating the mole,

20:59.259 --> 21:03.263
and, frankly, I could use
someone with experience.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.223
I'm not sure if busting

21:05.390 --> 21:06.751
a couple of small-time
drug dealers

21:06.766 --> 21:09.227
qualifies me for espionage work,
Dr. Manchester.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.730
Besides, how do you know
I'm not the spy?

21:13.231 --> 21:15.316
Well, I don't, actually.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.319
Well...

21:19.779 --> 21:23.449
I'll tell you
why I'm not the spy.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.162
Motive. It's the first thing
you look for.

21:28.371 --> 21:31.040
What in the hell would my motive
be for helping the same bugs

21:31.124 --> 21:32.644
I've been trying to kill
for two years?

21:32.709 --> 21:33.751
I see your point.

21:34.002 --> 21:38.381
Uh, there... are some files

21:38.589 --> 21:40.150
that I would like you
to take a look at.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.384
And here's the list.

21:45.096 --> 21:48.182
<i>There are a lot of names here
that I recognize.</i>

21:48.516 --> 21:49.976
Some I know really well,

21:51.436 --> 21:53.021
I fought side-by-side with.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.398
Yes, I'm afraid so.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.443
What do you need me for?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.070
Because I've got about 50
possible suspects on that list,

22:01.237 --> 22:05.575
and to be candid, I could use
some help narrowing it down.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.999
Thank you for coming
on such short notice,

22:13.166 --> 22:15.043
Professor, Colonel Weaver.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.753
You said you had something
important to tell us?

22:16.919 --> 22:18.520
We have received reports
that the Espheni

22:18.671 --> 22:19.714
are once again preparing

22:19.881 --> 22:21.632
<i>a major offensive
against Charleston.</i>

22:21.799 --> 22:24.218
Let 'em try. They failed
the past three times.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.054
I agree.
Thanks to the Volm,

22:26.220 --> 22:27.638
our defenses
are stronger than ever.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.085
Suddenly they want to attack us?

22:29.223 --> 22:31.100
Gluttons for punishment,
I guess.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.477
MAN: <i>You've put them
behind schedule.</i>

22:32.643 --> 22:35.104
<i>The Espheni do not like
their timetables disrupted.</i>

22:35.271 --> 22:36.898
Glad to know we've been
making it tough for them.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.858
True, but it bears repeating

22:38.941 --> 22:41.152
that the humans are not
the ultimate target...

22:41.319 --> 22:42.403
the Volm are,

22:42.570 --> 22:45.031
and their troop ships
are heading toward your planet.

22:45.198 --> 22:48.409
- To destroy the Espheni?
- So <i>they</i> say.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.873
Thank you
for the advance warning.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.417
We'll discuss a strategy
and inform you of our plan.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.003
MAN: <i>As always, we 're standing
by to assist, Professor.</i>

23:00.254 --> 23:01.839
There is one more thing.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.342
A new overlord has replaced
the one killed by you.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.552
It is rumored to be
even more dangerous

23:06.719 --> 23:08.429
and ruthless
than its predecessor.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.598
That's hardly surprising.

23:11.682 --> 23:12.975
Ordinarily, I would agree,

23:13.101 --> 23:15.603
except that this particular
overlord is human.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.563
Human?

23:17.814 --> 23:19.774
(ALIEN VOCALIZES)
- MAN: Correct.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.901
Karen.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.214
What are you doing?

23:43.381 --> 23:44.924
You fell asleep
on top of the bed

23:45.049 --> 23:46.217
with all your clothes on.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.469
Oh, I was trying
to sneak in a nap.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.263
It's been a long couple of days.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.764
I bet.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.350
Twenty-five kids de-harnessed,
not one complication.

23:54.517 --> 23:57.395
- That's got to feel good.
- It does. A lot.

23:57.603 --> 24:01.357
(SIGHS) I only wish we had
the Volm's technology

24:01.566 --> 24:04.068
a couple of years ago,
so many children lost.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.240
How are you?
How's your day going?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.451
Same. Crazy.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.329
Miles to go before I sleep,
I'm afraid.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.831
What?

24:18.258 --> 24:20.018
This is Marina
and her scheduling neurosis...

24:20.042 --> 24:21.085
This isn't Marina.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.088
Somebody needs to stop
telling her to play White House.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.091
White House and the president
of 20 square blocks.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.135
And Charleston's growing.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.596
Refugees
are coming in every day.

24:33.055 --> 24:36.434
There's got to be a feeling
of safety and security,

24:36.601 --> 24:38.853
or it will all end up in chaos.

24:39.061 --> 24:43.274
I never thought I'd say this,
but I miss being on the road,

24:43.441 --> 24:44.609
being chased by skitters.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.777
It seems like
we had more time together.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.155
I know.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.993
I'll see you later.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.380
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

25:08.382 --> 25:09.542
It's just something he needs.

25:09.634 --> 25:10.760
- Hey-
- Hey-

25:11.010 --> 25:12.170
You wanna grab a bite to eat?

25:12.261 --> 25:14.102
Someone opened this
Shawarma stand in Pope Town

25:14.180 --> 25:15.556
I've been dying to try.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.724
I'm sure we could barter

25:16.812 --> 25:18.452
a couple of house calls
for a meal or two.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.519
Honestly, I'm beat.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.604
I'm gonna check on that
appendectomy in bed 17

25:21.687 --> 25:23.488
and then crash in my bed
like a 10-ton weight.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.691
I totally get it.
Rain check, then?

25:25.816 --> 25:27.985
Yeah. Absolutely.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.195
Hey, I got it.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.571
No, I got it. Unh.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.114
Uh-oh.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.950
My water broke.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.871
Dad, Anne's having the baby now.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.375
- Tom, I think I've done it.
- Done what, Arthur?

25:42.583 --> 25:44.623
Narrowed the list down
to a dozen possible suspects.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.189
Now, you're
not gonna believe it, but...

25:46.212 --> 25:48.297
Oh, I can't talk right now.
Anne's having the baby.

25:48.506 --> 25:52.134
Oh. Oh. It can wait.
It can wait.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.347
A militia group from Wisconsin
spotted your camp

25:56.472 --> 25:58.713
when they were crossing over
the black hills in Kentucky.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.269
Kentucky? Really?

26:02.019 --> 26:04.260
We've been trying to rescue
as many of the harnessed kids

26:04.313 --> 26:06.274
as we can ever since
the new aliens provided us

26:06.440 --> 26:08.359
with technology to safely
remove the harness.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.194
Did you know I'd be there?

26:10.361 --> 26:12.321
Every camp we went to,
I looked for you.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.573
This time, I got lucky.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.950
Is that their place,
the new aliens?

26:16.117 --> 26:18.077
- That's it.
- How many are there?

26:18.244 --> 26:19.829
Twenty. Twenty-five.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.557
No one knows for sure,
since they mostly

26:21.581 --> 26:23.382
stay in their bunker
or whatever they call it.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.834
Where'd they come from?

26:25.751 --> 26:28.212
I'm not exactly sure.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.173
They told us their planet
had been invaded, same as us.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.425
For hundreds of years,

26:32.592 --> 26:33.634
they've been chasing
the overlords,

26:33.801 --> 26:36.304
trying to liberate planets
they've tried to destroy.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.972
Do you trust them?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.892
Well, it's because of them
Charleston is safe.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.395
They've given us
new weapons and strategies.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.445
It's hard not to believe
what they say is true.

26:46.564 --> 26:47.815
Who can argue with winning?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.525
But do you trust them?

26:51.861 --> 26:53.571
They're aliens.

26:53.738 --> 26:54.947
Who's to say
they're any better than

With his ten year old master?

27:12.214 --> 27:13.758
He's 12. Look, it's Manga.

Weird, is what it is.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.346

you just one small,

- Shut up! All right?

Dr. Manchester

30:13.979 --> 30:16.232
was shot with a gun
modified with Volm tech.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.942
That narrows
it down to the military.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.820
We're the only ones with access
to the modified weapons.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.863
We should at least make sure
all those are accounted for.

You're not responsible for this.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.584
Arthur claimed
he was getting close,

30:35.751 --> 30:37.545
that he'd narrowed down
the list of suspects.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.589
That is possible, I suppose,
but if he wrote it down,

30:40.840 --> 30:41.882
it's not here.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.568
Which means
his killer took it with him,

30:43.634 --> 30:44.718
which means
he must have been close.

30:44.969 --> 30:47.179
Too close, I'm afraid.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.932
Dr. Manchester
was basically a good man.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.978
Sometimes misguided,

30:54.144 --> 30:55.980
but his heart was always

we need to know who, and fast.

don't have much to go on,

Dr. Manchester gave me.

- General Porter.

the weapon that will
ultimately gain us victory,

It's a human war.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.752
And the minute
we start forgetting that,

38:15.919 --> 38:18.297
the minute we start depending

38:18.463 --> 38:20.799
on somebody else
to do this work for us,

38:20.966 --> 38:22.009
we're on a bad road.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.344
You're never gonna get me
to change my mind on that.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.307
And if I could?

38:28.598 --> 38:31.810
(SIGHS) I don't understand.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.485
Come with me.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.467
(GROANS)

39:14.853 --> 39:16.563
(GASPS)

39:25.697 --> 39:28.408
What are you doing over there?

39:30.035 --> 39:31.119
I'm looking for your boots.

39:32.412 --> 39:33.663
They were right here.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.166
That's where we left them
last... last night.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.502
Yeah, well,
they're not there now.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.630
You sleep okay last night?

39:42.005 --> 39:44.424
Yeah. I did.

39:44.591 --> 39:47.302
- Finally.
- No nightmares?

39:47.511 --> 39:50.389
- No, not one.
- That's great.

39:51.765 --> 39:55.560
Here they are, way at the back.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.062
That's weird.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.204
WEAVER: Do Bressler and Porter
know about this?

40:08.240 --> 40:09.741
I'm the only human
that knows about this project,

40:09.908 --> 40:10.951
except for you now.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.440
Cochise and I agreed it posed
too much of a security risk.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.913
You and Cochise?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.560
All the skirmishing,
all the missions,

40:16.581 --> 40:18.250
everything that we've been doing
has been designed

40:18.417 --> 40:20.057
to keep the Espheni off
the scent of this.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.420
It's kind of a big thing
to have kept from me,

40:21.670 --> 40:23.797
- wouldn't you say, Tom?
- I know.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.966
I have to take responsibility
for that action, Colonel Weaver.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.552
I asked Professor Mason
to keep this project secret

40:28.718 --> 40:29.799
until the very last moment.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.931
You know the tower
in Boston we tried to blow up?

40:32.139 --> 40:33.932
- All too well.
- It's one of thousands.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.892
They create
a sort of defensive web

40:36.059 --> 40:37.144
that prevent the Volm ships

40:37.310 --> 40:38.603
from being able
to enter our atmosphere.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.355
COCHISE: Eliminating
just one of those towers

40:40.522 --> 40:42.162
will be enough
to open up a gap sufficient

40:42.232 --> 40:43.817
to let one of our ships
enter the atmosphere.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.194
This is what
the mole has been after.

40:54.703 --> 40:59.124
I don't get it, Tom.
What? A big gun?

40:59.749 --> 41:01.334
What is this?

41:02.461 --> 41:05.547
More than just a gun, Colonel.

41:05.714 --> 41:08.592
When completed,
it will be the decisive factor

41:08.800 --> 41:10.677
in ending this conflict.

41:12.721 --> 41:16.391
A chance to win this war, Dan.
Think of it.

41:21.021 --> 41:24.983
What's this bad boy
supposed to do, anyway?

42:06.358 --> 42:08.401
