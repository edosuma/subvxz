00:17.457 --> 00:18.490
Tell me what you know.

00:18.558 --> 00:21.126
The hitter has someone on the inside.

00:21.194 --> 00:23.262
Victor Aruz told me right before he died

00:23.330 --> 00:24.830
that the assassin's working
with someone very close

00:24.898 --> 00:26.065
to President Hassan.

00:26.132 --> 00:28.067
Someone hacked into the U.N. database.

00:28.134 --> 00:29.301
They downloaded the security protocols,

00:29.369 --> 00:31.003
the schematics to the U.N.

00:31.071 --> 00:33.472
and Hassan's personal itinerary.

00:33.540 --> 00:34.807
<i> Did you get a name?</i>

00:34.874 --> 00:36.575
The computer's owner is listed as

00:36.643 --> 00:38.644
Meredith Michelle Reed. She's a reporter.

00:38.712 --> 00:40.475
Applied for security clearance at the U.N.

00:40.510 --> 00:41.648
We got a match.

00:41.683 --> 00:42.991
Everybody move back!

00:43.026 --> 00:44.283
Move back! Mr. President,
you need to come with us.

00:44.351 --> 00:45.484
Mr. President.

00:46.953 --> 00:49.488
I can't believe she's part of this.

00:50.697 --> 00:51.390
<i>If this affair becomes public,</i>

00:51.457 --> 00:53.191
it will destroy your credibility

00:53.259 --> 00:54.960
and everything that you've worked for.

00:55.028 --> 00:56.461
I just spoke to my brother.

00:56.529 --> 00:57.963
I told him to deny the affair.

00:58.031 --> 01:00.632
The reporter's claims
need to be discredited.

01:00.700 --> 01:04.836
CTU needs to continue to think
she's my contact on the inside.

01:04.904 --> 01:06.572
We might have the wrong person.

01:06.639 --> 01:09.107
We've been scanning through
the traffic cam footage

01:09.175 --> 01:10.742
from outside Meredith
Reed's apartment building.

01:10.810 --> 01:12.778
This man was going into
the service entrance.

01:12.845 --> 01:14.179
What if he went through her apartment

01:14.247 --> 01:16.715
and used her laptop to
break into the servers?

01:16.783 --> 01:18.584
He hailed a cab when he left.

01:18.651 --> 01:20.619
See the medallion? Phone the cab company.

01:20.687 --> 01:21.920
Find out where it went.

01:25.491 --> 01:28.760
Hands in the air now! Against the wall!

01:28.828 --> 01:31.096
<i>Chloe tracked the man in the
surveillance photo</i>

01:31.164 --> 01:32.798
to a second location.

01:32.865 --> 01:34.533
We didn't think you'd follow
through with an investigation.

01:34.601 --> 01:35.601
So you had no choice

01:35.668 --> 01:37.069
except to steal weapons from the armory.

01:37.136 --> 01:39.304
Would you follow through with
an investigation if I'd asked?

01:39.372 --> 01:40.539
I'm not debating this anymore.

01:40.607 --> 01:41.740
You want to waste your time

01:41.808 --> 01:43.742
chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.

01:43.810 --> 01:45.777
Hello?

01:45.845 --> 01:48.380
"Dana Walsh." I like that.

01:48.448 --> 01:50.115
I told you to stop calling me.

01:50.183 --> 01:52.217
<i>Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.</i>

01:52.285 --> 01:55.087
You must be mistaking me for someone else.

01:55.154 --> 01:57.189
That's funny 'cause you
sound a lot like this girl

01:57.256 --> 01:59.458
I used to know from Rock
Springs named Jenny Scott.

01:59.525 --> 02:02.394
Hey, Mike, what's going on?

02:02.462 --> 02:03.929
Mind if I come in?

02:05.198 --> 02:06.131
Oh, Mikey.

02:06.199 --> 02:08.734
Call Captain Ravello.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.637
Tell him you're sick,
and I'm filling in for you.

02:11.704 --> 02:13.538
Now listen, you son of a bitch,
there's no way...

02:14.741 --> 02:15.874
What's the matter with you?!

02:15.942 --> 02:18.577
Next time I won't miss the bone.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.181
Make... the call.

02:30.556 --> 02:31.957
This is Hastings.

02:32.025 --> 02:33.291
Tell me you've gotten something out of

02:33.359 --> 02:34.926
<i>that reporter you arrested. No, sir.</i>

02:34.994 --> 02:36.061
I'm continuing to press her,

02:36.129 --> 02:37.262
but she's maintaining her innocence.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.097
She's a co-conspirator
in an assassination plot.

02:39.165 --> 02:40.465
Of course she's gonna deny it.

02:40.533 --> 02:41.733
Listen, I need to be able

02:41.801 --> 02:43.101
to tell the president we're making progress

02:43.169 --> 02:44.436
toward averting this threat.

02:44.504 --> 02:45.771
Sir, right now our only course is

02:45.838 --> 02:48.106
to go after Meredith Reed with
the evidence we have in hand.

02:48.174 --> 02:49.741
Our top analyst is decrypting a file

02:49.809 --> 02:51.076
we obtained from her laptop.

02:51.144 --> 02:53.211
We're hoping it provides the intel we need

02:53.279 --> 02:54.579
about the assassin she's working with.

02:54.647 --> 02:56.148
Well, it'd better provide something

02:56.215 --> 02:58.483
because if your people fail,
and President Hassan is killed,

02:58.551 --> 03:00.152
this peace process dies with him.

03:00.219 --> 03:01.920
Do you understand me?

03:01.988 --> 03:03.255
I understand your concern, Mr. Weiss,

03:03.322 --> 03:05.924
but I assure you we're
on top of the situation.

03:05.992 --> 03:07.959
I've dispatched tactical personnel

03:08.027 --> 03:10.228
to liaise with U.N. security forces

03:10.296 --> 03:12.497
and stepped up the alert
with NYPD at the perimeter.

03:12.565 --> 03:14.633
Fine. I'll have that to tell her at least.

03:14.701 --> 03:16.768
Let me know when that file is decrypted.

03:30.149 --> 03:31.883
Dana, you got a minute?

03:31.951 --> 03:33.885
I thought you were on your way to the U.N.

03:33.953 --> 03:36.188
I am. What's the status
on that file decryption?

03:36.255 --> 03:37.522
We I.D.'d the cipher.

03:37.590 --> 03:39.191
It's a standard Issacs-Adler algorithm.

03:39.258 --> 03:41.026
Requires a 12-character decryption key

03:41.094 --> 03:43.028
to unlock the data.

03:43.096 --> 03:46.031
The search cycle has identified
two characters already.

03:46.099 --> 03:48.366
Should have the rest in
about 30 or 40 minutes.

03:48.434 --> 03:49.701
Why do you ask?

03:49.769 --> 03:52.804
Jack Bauer just caused a
big scene with Hastings.

03:52.872 --> 03:56.341
He thinks Meredith Reed
may have been framed.

03:56.409 --> 03:59.678
He must have gotten that from Chloe.

03:59.746 --> 04:00.946
I thought that she'd dropped it.

04:01.013 --> 04:02.047
Apparently not.

04:02.115 --> 04:03.482
She has surveillance of someone exiting

04:03.549 --> 04:05.016
Reed's apartment building.

04:05.084 --> 04:06.184
Jack thinks this same person

04:06.252 --> 04:07.552
may have planted the encrypted file

04:07.620 --> 04:08.920
on Reed's computer. You believe that?

04:08.988 --> 04:11.056
I'm not sure.

04:11.124 --> 04:12.557
If that evidence was planted,

04:12.625 --> 04:15.193
the file you're decrypting
is irrelevant at best;

04:15.261 --> 04:16.695
at worst a misdirection.

04:16.762 --> 04:20.832
Cole, I traced the U.N.
breach to Reed myself.

04:20.899 --> 04:22.334
The biometric scans of her interrogation

04:22.401 --> 04:24.002
all indicate that she's withholding.

04:24.070 --> 04:26.071
I just don't see a frame here.

04:26.139 --> 04:27.272
I hope you're right

04:27.340 --> 04:29.407
because Jack's going after
this guy on his own.

04:29.475 --> 04:31.376
Hastings sanctioned that?

04:31.444 --> 04:33.111
Not exactly.

04:33.179 --> 04:35.380
Agent Ortiz? We need to move out, sir.

04:35.448 --> 04:36.848
Be careful.

04:36.916 --> 04:38.283
Don't worry.

04:46.125 --> 04:50.195
<i> Okay, I'm at the corner of
Broadway and West 23rd</i>

04:50.263 --> 04:52.264
in Queens. Any location on the suspect?

04:52.331 --> 04:53.899
Negative. I talked to
the cab driver directly.

04:53.966 --> 04:56.635
All he remembers is dropping
the fare at the corner.

04:56.702 --> 04:58.270
Nothing shows up in the aerial archives.

04:58.337 --> 05:00.005
Chloe, I need something to go on.

05:00.072 --> 05:01.139
I know. I've been searching

05:01.207 --> 05:02.541
for private security cameras in the area.

05:02.608 --> 05:04.376
Not all of them are registered.

05:04.443 --> 05:06.778
Without the serial numbers,
I don't have access to them.

05:06.846 --> 05:08.914
Okay, I'm gonna get out
and look around on foot.

05:08.981 --> 05:10.682
Maybe we'll get lucky. Stay on the line.

05:15.121 --> 05:16.188
It's all right, Mags.

05:16.255 --> 05:18.557
It's gonna be okay, right?

05:18.624 --> 05:21.326
Keep your hand on the
table where I can see it.

05:33.506 --> 05:34.573
You're not a cop. you?ou?

05:36.509 --> 05:38.710
How did you manage to fool everybody, Mikey,

05:38.778 --> 05:40.779
or whatever the hell your name is?

05:44.483 --> 05:45.417
Talk to me,

05:45.484 --> 05:47.352
you son of a bitch!

05:57.163 --> 05:58.496
Shh-shh-shh.

06:02.935 --> 06:04.569
Look,

06:04.637 --> 06:08.440
I don't want to hurt you, Jim, or Maggie.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.810
I am just doing my job.

06:21.654 --> 06:24.923
This is the captain calling back.

06:24.991 --> 06:28.827
Just say what I told you to say.

06:28.895 --> 06:30.428
Please don't make me do

06:30.496 --> 06:32.631
anhing I don't want to do.

06:32.698 --> 06:34.432
Okay?

06:36.035 --> 06:37.335
Yeah.

06:40.473 --> 06:41.740
Hello.

06:41.807 --> 06:43.141
Koernig,  Captain Ravello. What's up?

06:43.209 --> 06:45.443
Uh, yeah, Captain,

06:45.511 --> 06:48.346
sorry to drop this on you last-minute.

06:48.414 --> 06:50.181
I just came down with some kind of bug.

06:50.249 --> 06:51.316
I got to take a sick leave.

06:51.384 --> 06:52.417
You could have told me earlier, Jim.

06:52.485 --> 06:53.752
You're due at the U.N. in 20.

06:53.819 --> 06:55.553
Yeah, I know. It's okay.

06:55.621 --> 06:58.423
I asked Mike Farmer to
cover my shift for me.

06:58.491 --> 07:00.091
Farmer's already on in the morning.

07:00.159 --> 07:01.927
He said he doesn't mind working a double.

07:01.994 --> 07:03.561
I guess he could use the time-and-a-half.

07:03.629 --> 07:05.964
Anyway, I already told
him he could use the bike

07:06.032 --> 07:07.499
that I pulled from the motor pool.

07:07.566 --> 07:08.967
All right, Sergeant.

07:09.035 --> 07:11.136
I'll take care of the paperwork.
Look, you tell Mike

07:11.203 --> 07:13.305
to get his butt to Midtown. You got that?

07:13.372 --> 07:15.206
Get better, will ya?

07:18.811 --> 07:20.145
Yeah.

07:26.152 --> 07:27.085
You did well.

07:27.153 --> 07:29.421
I did what you wanted me to do,

07:29.488 --> 07:31.423
all right, so...

07:31.490 --> 07:33.124
Do what you got to do

07:33.192 --> 07:35.393
and leave us alone.

07:40.933 --> 07:44.302
We're not gonna make any trouble for you.

07:52.611 --> 07:53.712
You still there?

07:53.779 --> 07:54.879
Jack, go ahead.

07:54.947 --> 07:56.548
Hold on. Hold on.

07:56.615 --> 07:59.384
Okay, I got two security cameras overlooking

07:59.452 --> 08:01.486
the park, one pointing
straight at the corner.

08:01.554 --> 08:03.421
I'm gonna get you the serial numbers.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.126
Hey, man, what you doing?

08:08.194 --> 08:11.129
Chloe, I got to get back to you.

08:11.197 --> 08:12.897
What's up? You lost, man?

08:12.965 --> 08:13.999
Actually, I am.

08:14.066 --> 08:16.234
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

08:16.302 --> 08:18.303
Well, unless you a cop,
I suggest look somewhere else,

08:18.371 --> 08:19.471
'cause this is our court.

08:19.538 --> 08:21.072
We don't like strangers on it.

08:21.140 --> 08:23.508
I ain't a cop, and I'm not
looking for a problem.

08:23.576 --> 08:24.943
My friend was let off on that corner

08:25.011 --> 08:26.244
by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago.

08:26.312 --> 08:29.881
I guess you didn't hear
what I'm saying, did you?

08:35.421 --> 08:36.654
I've got a hundred bucks;

08:36.722 --> 08:38.923
anybody can tell me if
they've seen this guy.

08:39.991 --> 08:42.092
Anybody?

08:43.996 --> 08:45.430
I seen him.

08:45.498 --> 08:47.565
Yo, shut up, Jay!

08:47.633 --> 08:49.200
What was he wearing?

08:49.268 --> 08:51.069
green coat, black shirt.

08:51.137 --> 08:52.504
Where'd he go?

08:52.571 --> 08:54.672
That light blue house over
there across the street.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.908
I seen him go up the steps to the stoop.

08:56.976 --> 08:59.110
Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.

09:07.753 --> 09:09.087
Yo, man, what you doing, Jay?!

09:09.155 --> 09:10.655
You don't even know what's going down.

09:10.723 --> 09:13.191
Man, I don't know about you,
but I got a hundred dollars.

09:13.259 --> 09:14.492
It's your play. Let's go.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.161
Man, I'm about to take that hundred dollars.

09:16.228 --> 09:17.295
Give me the ball, man.

09:35.681 --> 09:38.716
Ã¢ÂTÂª Ã¢ÂTÂª

10:49.421 --> 10:50.755
All right.

10:58.164 --> 10:59.531
Jim!

11:01.100 --> 11:04.035
Hello. Jack?

11:04.103 --> 11:07.071
Got a call from one of your neighbors.

11:08.073 --> 11:09.207
Jim?

11:09.275 --> 11:11.409
Hello, Jack?

11:12.945 --> 11:14.179
CHLOE : Jack, what's happening?

11:14.246 --> 11:15.480
Are you there...?

11:20.286 --> 11:21.719
Put the weapon down now. Do it.

11:23.122 --> 11:24.055
My name is Jack Bauer.

11:24.123 --> 11:25.390
I'm working on behalf of CTU.

11:25.457 --> 11:26.791
I'm investigating a threat
to the peace conference

11:26.859 --> 11:29.218
at the U.N. If that's true,
drop your weapon.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.128
I can't.

11:30.196 --> 11:32.096
The man I'm pursuing killed
two people in this house.

11:32.164 --> 11:33.631
If I lower this weapon, I'll be sidelined.

11:33.699 --> 11:34.632
That can't happen.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.438
What are you doing? He's down.

11:40.505 --> 11:42.506
Son of a bitch is a cop killer.

11:42.574 --> 11:45.376
John, stop! We got to call this in.

11:45.444 --> 11:46.611
Not yet we don't.

11:50.649 --> 11:51.949
Help me get him in.

11:53.018 --> 11:55.052
Come on! Help me get him in!

12:11.262 --> 12:12.662
So where are we?

12:12.730 --> 12:15.298
As of right now, we've got
half the decryption key.

12:15.366 --> 12:16.466
That's all?

12:16.534 --> 12:18.034
Can't we accelerate the program?

12:18.102 --> 12:20.670
It's already running at capacity, sir.

12:20.738 --> 12:22.572
Mr. Hastings. Sir, we just found this

12:22.640 --> 12:24.040
among Meredith Reed's personal effects.

12:24.108 --> 12:25.275
It's a dedicated key card,

12:25.343 --> 12:27.077
United Nations issue.

12:27.144 --> 12:28.111
Issued to who?

12:28.179 --> 12:29.312
President Hassan and his family.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.082
It accesses their private residence.

12:32.149 --> 12:33.350
We got her.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.153
Dana Walsh.

12:37.221 --> 12:38.555
Ms. Walsh, this is security

12:38.623 --> 12:41.057
at Perimeter Gate 9. You have a visitor.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.058
A visitor?

12:42.126 --> 12:44.127
A Mr. Kevin Wade.

12:44.195 --> 12:46.396
Says he's a friend of yours.

12:54.572 --> 12:56.640
Ms. Walsh?

12:58.576 --> 13:01.011
Tell him I'll be right there.

13:48.159 --> 13:50.794
So this, uh... this CTU--

13:50.861 --> 13:52.696
some kind of government deal, huh?

13:52.763 --> 13:54.597
Law enforcement?

13:54.665 --> 13:55.999
Ms. Walsh is on her way.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.668
Thanks.

14:08.479 --> 14:11.548
Hey, Dana.

14:11.615 --> 14:14.451
Look at you, all pressed and pretty.

14:18.222 --> 14:20.657
I think I like you as a blonde.

14:20.725 --> 14:21.758
What are you doing here?

14:21.826 --> 14:23.593
I thought I told you to leave me alone.

14:23.661 --> 14:25.362
And I told you not to hang up on me, Jenny.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.130
Don't.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.698
Don't call me that.

14:28.766 --> 14:31.735
Oh, you-you... you want me to play along?

14:31.802 --> 14:33.236
Okay, I'll play along.

14:33.304 --> 14:35.171
But I'm not going to let you pretend

14:35.239 --> 14:37.207
that you don't know me.

14:37.274 --> 14:38.575
Fine.

14:40.211 --> 14:42.912
You found me, so now what?

14:42.980 --> 14:46.616
You think we're just going
to pick up where we left off?

14:46.684 --> 14:48.918
Why not?

14:48.986 --> 14:50.520
We had a good thing going.

14:50.588 --> 14:51.688
No.

14:51.756 --> 14:52.989
No, we didn't.

14:53.057 --> 14:55.658
I was naive, and I let
myself be taken in by you.

14:55.726 --> 14:56.893
I am not that person

14:56.961 --> 14:58.828
anymore. Yeah?

15:03.034 --> 15:05.101
CTU.

15:05.169 --> 15:07.003
Senior Data Analyst.

15:07.071 --> 15:09.973
Well, sounds like an important job.

15:10.041 --> 15:13.109
I'm thinking you always were the smart one.

15:14.678 --> 15:16.379
How the hell did you pull this off?

15:16.447 --> 15:19.115
What, you steal a dead girl's
birth certificate or something?

15:19.183 --> 15:21.418
Look, I have money.

15:21.485 --> 15:24.154
Not a lot, but some.

15:24.221 --> 15:25.855
If that's what it'll take.

15:27.558 --> 15:31.461
If you really still care about me,

15:31.529 --> 15:34.197
you'll leave me alone.

15:37.401 --> 15:39.302
Say my name.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.538
What?

15:43.240 --> 15:46.376
If you're gonna beg,

15:46.444 --> 15:48.244
I want to hear you say my name.

15:48.312 --> 15:50.814
Just like you used to.

15:55.719 --> 15:57.587
Kevin.

15:57.655 --> 15:59.456
Say, "Please, Kevin."

16:03.360 --> 16:07.964
Please... Kevin.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.165
There's my bad girl.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.000
Damn it! What do you want from me?!

16:11.068 --> 16:13.536
A place to crash for starters.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.939
I'm getting a little tired of living out
of the van. No, that is not gonna happen.

16:16.006 --> 16:20.343
Yeah? Well, now you don't want me...

16:20.411 --> 16:22.078
to tell everyone you work with

16:22.146 --> 16:24.180
your little secret now, do you?

16:24.248 --> 16:26.649
You see, I don't want to do that.

16:27.818 --> 16:29.252
Come on.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.221
It'll be fun having me around.

16:31.288 --> 16:33.656
It'll be just like old times.

16:33.724 --> 16:36.693
You'll come home...

16:38.562 --> 16:40.530
...and we'll catch up.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.301
Fine, fine.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.476
You can stay the night.

16:53.544 --> 16:55.512
I want you out tomorrow.

17:01.552 --> 17:04.487
Whatever you say.

17:04.555 --> 17:07.123
Do you want my address?

17:08.893 --> 17:10.492
I already got it.

17:25.442 --> 17:29.012
I'm going to ask you again, Ms. Reed,

17:29.079 --> 17:32.282
and this time I want an answer.

17:32.349 --> 17:35.652
Now we know that this key card
was issued to President Hassan

17:35.719 --> 17:37.820
and his family at the U.N.

17:37.888 --> 17:39.155
I want to know

17:39.223 --> 17:40.857
where you got it.

17:40.925 --> 17:43.092
I'm not saying another word
until my attorney gets here.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.762
You're already looking at a life sentence

17:45.829 --> 17:47.197
in a federal penitentiary.

17:47.264 --> 17:48.364
So if this plot succeeds

17:48.432 --> 17:49.465
and Hassan dies,

17:49.533 --> 17:52.702
I promise you the death penalty.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.938
If you give me the name of the assassin,

17:55.005 --> 17:57.340
maybe we can cut a deal.

17:57.408 --> 18:00.944
I told you I don't know anything.
You know who you stole

18:01.011 --> 18:02.278
his key card from.

18:02.346 --> 18:03.947
I didn't steal it.

18:04.014 --> 18:05.848
Then you manufactured it, cloned it somehow!

18:05.916 --> 18:06.849
No.

18:06.917 --> 18:07.951
And used it to gain access

18:08.018 --> 18:09.953
to the U.N. security data. I, I...

18:10.020 --> 18:11.321
Where did you get it?! Tell me!

18:11.388 --> 18:12.922
He gave it to me.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.524
Who?

18:16.193 --> 18:17.393
Who?!

18:17.461 --> 18:18.528
Omar.

18:22.399 --> 18:24.434
Omar gave it to me.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.336
President Hassan?

18:26.403 --> 18:28.638
Why would he do that?

18:30.274 --> 18:33.543
So I could have access
to his private residence

18:33.611 --> 18:37.113
when he wanted to be alone with me.

18:37.181 --> 18:38.448
You really expect me to believe

18:38.515 --> 18:39.782
that you're involved with him?

18:39.850 --> 18:42.852
Believe what you want. It's the truth.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.090
This is Hastings.

18:47.157 --> 18:48.625
Put me through to Rob Weiss

18:48.692 --> 18:49.859
at the U.N.

18:49.927 --> 18:51.194
What are you doing?

18:51.262 --> 18:53.263
I need to speak with President Taylor

18:53.330 --> 18:55.365
to get permission to talk with Omar Hassan.

18:55.432 --> 18:59.168
Now if there's something you
want to say to me, Ms. Reed,

18:59.236 --> 19:01.137
now is the time to say it.

19:01.205 --> 19:02.639
WOMAN : I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.374
Mr. Weiss is in a closed session,

19:04.441 --> 19:06.409
but they're expecting to break shortly.

19:06.477 --> 19:07.977
All right, just relay the message

19:08.045 --> 19:10.380
to have him call me back as soon as he can.

19:10.447 --> 19:12.649
Yes, sir.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.218
Looks like you have a bit more time

19:15.286 --> 19:18.221
to reconsider your story.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.757
You let me know when
you're ready to change it.

19:32.336 --> 19:34.537
Mr. Hastings, I need your help.

19:34.605 --> 19:36.339
I've lost contact with Jack.

19:36.407 --> 19:38.007
He called me 15 minutes ago. We got cut off.

19:38.075 --> 19:39.342
I haven't been able to reach him since.

19:39.410 --> 19:42.211
This is your operation,
Chloe-- yours and Bauer's.

19:42.279 --> 19:44.247
I don't see why this should be my concern.

19:44.315 --> 19:46.115
He could be in some kind of trouble.

19:46.183 --> 19:47.517
You need to send for backup.

19:47.584 --> 19:49.686
Even if I wanted to,
we don't have the manpower.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.721
I dispatched all field personnel to the U.N.

19:51.789 --> 19:52.789
for Hassan's protection.

19:52.856 --> 19:54.123
I watched the interrogation.

19:54.191 --> 19:55.725
I heard what Reed said about
her affair with Hassan.

19:55.793 --> 19:57.560
If that's true, it supports
our idea that she was framed.

19:57.628 --> 19:58.895
And how do you figure that?

19:58.962 --> 20:00.063
Because it explains why

20:00.130 --> 20:01.864
the biometrics registered her deception,

20:01.932 --> 20:03.599
and why the real insider

20:03.667 --> 20:06.035
within Hassan's camp chose her
to divert our investigation.

20:06.103 --> 20:08.071
Reed is lying.

20:08.138 --> 20:09.238
There is no affair.

20:09.306 --> 20:10.406
But what if there is?

20:12.009 --> 20:13.743
If President Hassan
corroborates Reed's claim,

20:13.811 --> 20:15.712
will you consider sending
units to find Jack?

20:15.779 --> 20:17.513
All right, fine.

20:17.581 --> 20:19.982
Just so you can hear for yourself,

20:20.050 --> 20:21.584
I'll have someone alert you

20:21.652 --> 20:23.486
when Hassan calls me back.
Is that good enough?

20:23.554 --> 20:26.789
No, but it's better than nothing.

20:35.332 --> 20:37.600
That couple you murdered upstairs

20:37.668 --> 20:39.402
were friends of mine, dirtbag.

20:39.470 --> 20:40.970
Good people.

20:41.038 --> 20:43.973
Mazoni, you can't do this.
No, what I can't do

20:44.041 --> 20:46.442
is watch another creep like
this walk on a technicality,

20:46.510 --> 20:48.544
or because some lawyer
didn't file the right papers

20:48.612 --> 20:49.746
to the right clerk.

20:51.448 --> 20:53.649
John! I've seen it happen
more times than I can count.

20:53.717 --> 20:55.752
You're new here, Phil. You don't know.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.420
Wait till you spend 15 years of your life

20:57.488 --> 20:58.755
grinding your teeth in this job.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.623
You talk to me then.

21:00.691 --> 21:02.692
What about that thing he said?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.128
About him working with CTU?
Did we find credentials on him?

21:05.195 --> 21:09.132
No. That's because he is
a lying piece of garbage.

21:10.367 --> 21:12.235
This was a home invasion robbery.

21:12.302 --> 21:13.536
Where nothing was taken.

21:13.604 --> 21:16.205
Because we showed up!

21:16.273 --> 21:18.141
Look, you got a problem with
what I'm doing here, Phil?

21:18.208 --> 21:21.444
Then go upstairs and wait till I'm finished.

21:21.512 --> 21:23.346
Go. Now!

21:25.816 --> 21:28.351
And remember, you don't call this in

21:28.419 --> 21:29.752
until I say so.

21:29.820 --> 21:30.953
You stick to the story.

21:31.021 --> 21:32.355
He was resisting arrest.

21:32.423 --> 21:33.556
You got that?

21:35.292 --> 21:38.661
You got that?

21:38.729 --> 21:43.366
Just, uh... don't kill him.

21:43.434 --> 21:44.700
I'll do my best.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.505
Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here?

21:49.573 --> 21:51.340
Koernig called in sick.

21:51.408 --> 21:52.508
Stomach thing.

21:52.576 --> 21:53.876
No kidding?

21:53.944 --> 21:55.978
I talked to him this morning.
He was feeling fine.

21:56.046 --> 21:57.980
Probably a few too many at lunch.

21:58.048 --> 21:59.882
...continue to receive rea
l-time updates at the U.N.

21:59.950 --> 22:01.984
CTU is confirming the link

22:02.052 --> 22:03.519
between the Stinger missile attack

22:03.587 --> 22:06.322
and the assassination plot
against President Hassan.

22:06.390 --> 22:09.192
In response, we're gonna push
the traffic perimeter out

22:09.259 --> 22:11.294
another six blocks and
close the Queensboro Bridge

22:11.361 --> 22:13.863
in both directions until noon tomorrow.

22:13.931 --> 22:15.865
Now, roadblock assignments
are on pages two and three

22:15.933 --> 22:17.366
of your briefing packets.

22:17.434 --> 22:19.368
Go ahead and double-check those now.

22:19.436 --> 22:23.906
CTU has also arrested an
individual inside the U.N.

22:23.974 --> 22:25.842
who we believe is a part of the plot.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.844
Hopefully, this will yield some information

22:27.911 --> 22:29.645
about the assassin himself.

22:29.713 --> 22:33.015
Until then, we have to assume
that he could strike at any time

22:33.083 --> 22:35.351
and will stop at nothing
to achieve his objective.

22:35.419 --> 22:38.354
He's already killed five
people that we know of,

22:38.422 --> 22:41.257
including two CTU agents.

22:41.325 --> 22:43.693
Whoever he is, he's a professional,

22:43.760 --> 22:47.196
which means everyone is to be
on high alert at all times.

22:47.264 --> 22:51.067
History is happening upstairs, people,

22:51.134 --> 22:53.069
and it's on our watch.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.878
Our position remains unchanged,
Madam President.

23:08.946 --> 23:12.515
We will not allow NATO to transit supplies

23:12.582 --> 23:14.083
to Afghanistan through our territory.

23:14.151 --> 23:16.419
What about non-military supplies?

23:16.486 --> 23:20.423
It is our belief that any NATO deployment

23:20.490 --> 23:22.591
in theegion, military or otherwise,

23:22.659 --> 23:26.796
will lead to more extremism, not less.

23:31.501 --> 23:33.269
Mr. President...

23:33.337 --> 23:35.338
uh, my director

23:35.405 --> 23:36.872
of Counterterrorism here in New York

23:36.940 --> 23:38.741
is requesting to speak to you on the phone.

23:38.809 --> 23:40.710
Now?

23:40.777 --> 23:42.712
It's an urgent matter.

23:42.779 --> 23:44.747
It's relating to the reporter
who was arrested earlier.

23:44.815 --> 23:47.917
Mr. Weiss will escort you
to the conference room.

23:49.252 --> 23:51.721
That is, unless you have any objections.

23:51.788 --> 23:54.090
No, not at all.

23:54.157 --> 23:56.258
This way, Mr. President.

24:04.835 --> 24:07.136
Do I have to remind you of our conversation?

24:07.204 --> 24:09.572
Omar, you must deny your
involvement with this woman.

24:09.639 --> 24:12.241
She has a name, Farhad.

24:12.309 --> 24:14.777
And I still can't believe that
she can be part of this plan.

24:14.845 --> 24:16.779
That should not be your
chief concern right now.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.448
If word of this affair gets out,
not only is your

24:19.516 --> 24:23.986
political career over,
but so is the peace process itself.

24:24.054 --> 24:26.222
You know what you have to do.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.865
Thank you. Mr. President.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.405
Hello?

24:42.472 --> 24:44.740
Mr. President,
this is Brian Hastings at CTU.

24:44.808 --> 24:47.510
I appreciate you getting back to me.

24:47.577 --> 24:49.678
What can I do for you, Mr. Hastings?

24:49.746 --> 24:50.913
Well, sir, I have a matter

24:50.981 --> 24:53.249
of some delicacy to discuss with you.

24:53.316 --> 24:54.817
Go on. Thank you, sir.

24:54.885 --> 24:56.452
I know that your time is valuable,

24:56.520 --> 24:57.953
so, I'll come right to the point.

24:58.021 --> 25:00.990
I understand Meredith Reed
is writing an article on you

25:01.058 --> 25:02.391
<i>for the Sunday Magazine.</i>

25:02.459 --> 25:03.759
Yes, that's correct.

25:03.827 --> 25:06.495
Do you know of any reason
she would be in possession

25:06.563 --> 25:09.231
of a key card to your residence at the U.N.?

25:09.299 --> 25:10.499
y card?

25:10.567 --> 25:12.168
Yes, sir.

25:12.235 --> 25:14.270
She claims that she got it from you.

25:14.337 --> 25:16.739
And that your relationship with her is...

25:16.807 --> 25:19.708
perhaps more than professional.

25:24.681 --> 25:26.682
Mr. President?

25:26.750 --> 25:31.587
Is there anyone listening to
our conversation, Mr. Hastings?

25:31.655 --> 25:32.888
Are we being recorded?

25:32.956 --> 25:34.223
No, sir.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.659
I'm speaking to you on a secure line.

25:36.726 --> 25:39.295
Then I will tell you what Ms.
Reed said is true.

25:39.362 --> 25:40.696
Omar!

25:40.764 --> 25:41.931
What are you doing?!

25:41.998 --> 25:43.466
Sir, are you confirming

25:43.533 --> 25:46.001
a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?

25:46.069 --> 25:48.337
Mr. Hastings, I trust
your complete discretion

25:48.405 --> 25:51.674
in this matter.

25:51.741 --> 25:53.609
And I'm sure you understand the ramification

25:53.677 --> 25:55.311
if what I'm telling you

25:55.378 --> 25:56.645
becomes public knowledge.

25:56.713 --> 25:58.114
Yes, sir, I understand.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.982
I gave Ms. Reed this key card

26:00.050 --> 26:02.418
for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

26:02.486 --> 26:04.687
I'm telling you all this
in the interests of justice

26:04.754 --> 26:06.021
because I'm convinced

26:06.089 --> 26:08.858
that Ms. Reed is not
part of this conspiracy.

26:08.925 --> 26:10.826
Excuse me for asking, sir,

26:10.894 --> 26:12.862
but are you basing that
certainty on anything

26:12.929 --> 26:14.463
other than your personal feelings?

26:15.832 --> 26:17.566
No, I suppose not.

26:18.602 --> 26:20.836
I see.

26:20.904 --> 26:22.505
Well, thank you for your candor,
Mr. President.

26:22.572 --> 26:24.907
I assure you that nothing we discussed

26:24.975 --> 26:26.976
will be disclosed from this office.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.444
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings.

26:28.512 --> 26:29.979
Good-bye, then.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.347
Good-bye.

26:31.414 --> 26:33.716
Have you any idea what you've done?

26:33.783 --> 26:36.018
The honorable thing.

26:43.527 --> 26:45.794
You said you'd send
backup to Jack's location.

26:45.862 --> 26:47.997
I said I'd consider it, and I have.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.999
Confirmation of the affair does
not prove Reed's innocence.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.468
For all we know, it's a
ploy she used to gain access

26:52.536 --> 26:55.671
to the U.N. security files,
Hassan's itinerary.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.106
In the meantime, Jack's still missing.

26:57.174 --> 26:58.340
He's not missing.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.775
You lost contact.

26:59.843 --> 27:01.844
His phone battery may have died.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.813
Or more likely, he's in an
area with bad cell reception.

27:04.881 --> 27:07.049
There's pockets of them all
over the five boroughs,

27:07.117 --> 27:09.685
which you would have known
if you were from around here.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.887
Fine, if you're not sending someone,
I'll go myself.

27:11.955 --> 27:13.756
No, you won't!

27:13.823 --> 27:15.157
Your concern for your friend

27:15.225 --> 27:16.358
is admirable,

27:16.426 --> 27:17.993
but that file we got off Reed's laptop--

27:18.061 --> 27:20.362
it's almost decrypted,
and depending what we find,

27:20.430 --> 27:21.931
I'm going to need you here.

27:21.998 --> 27:24.033
Is that clear? Yeah.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.602
Now, earlier today,
you suggested that I speak to you

27:26.670 --> 27:29.171
more clearly and directly.

27:29.239 --> 27:31.540
You leave the building, you're fired.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.810
Is that clear and direct enough for you?

27:54.264 --> 27:55.531
Hello?

27:55.599 --> 27:56.765
We have a problem.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.067
My brother confessed to the affair.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.369
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.

28:00.437 --> 28:03.739
That's unfortunate.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.174
Don't you understand?!

28:05.242 --> 28:06.609
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded

28:06.676 --> 28:07.943
to Reed's computer is genuine.

28:08.011 --> 28:10.279
I agree it isn't ideal,

28:10.347 --> 28:14.116
but they will still have to act
on what they find in any event.

28:14.184 --> 28:17.553
There's no reason to diverge from the plan.

28:17.621 --> 28:20.789
But you need to remain
calm and play your part.

28:20.857 --> 28:22.124
How much longer?

28:22.192 --> 28:25.127
I promise you.

28:25.195 --> 28:29.898
Your brother will be dead
before the hour is out.

29:15.685 --> 29:17.211
Don't move!

29:17.354 --> 29:19.821
Drop that! Now!

29:19.889 --> 29:22.491
Officer, everything I
told you before is true.

29:22.559 --> 29:23.992
My name is Jack Bauer.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.545
I'm a former federal agent.
He's lying, Phil!

29:25.562 --> 29:26.762
Shoot the son of a bitch!

29:26.830 --> 29:28.164
He broke my damn rib!

29:28.232 --> 29:29.932
Contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.634
She'll verify my identity and the
threat to the peace conference.

29:31.702 --> 29:32.635
What are you waiting for? Shoot him already!

29:32.703 --> 29:34.270
Sit back down, John.

29:34.338 --> 29:35.771
You want to be pointing that gun

29:35.839 --> 29:38.307
someplace else. I said don't move,
either of you!

29:38.375 --> 29:39.742
What the hell? I'm your partner!

29:39.810 --> 29:41.077
No, this has gone far enough.

29:41.144 --> 29:42.278
I'm calling it in.

29:42.346 --> 29:43.613
You don't want to do that.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.814
Come on, Phil. Put the phone down.

29:44.882 --> 29:46.115
Let's talk about this.

29:46.183 --> 29:49.085
Shut up!

29:49.152 --> 29:50.853
This is Patrolman Phillip Lu.

29:50.921 --> 29:53.356
I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell.

29:53.423 --> 29:55.157
The officer upstairs has to be

29:55.225 --> 29:57.827
connected to the assassination plot.
Oh, you happy now?!

29:57.895 --> 29:58.961
You hearing what he's saying
about Koernig? All I'm saying is

29:59.029 --> 30:00.296
that there's a connection.

30:00.364 --> 30:01.464
We need to find out what it is.

30:01.531 --> 30:03.132
Both of you, shut the hell up!

30:03.200 --> 30:05.301
Lieutenant, sir.

30:05.369 --> 30:07.570
I'm at the scene of a double homicide.

30:07.638 --> 30:09.138
One of the victims is a cop,

30:09.206 --> 30:12.308
a James Koernig out of Midtown Center.

30:12.376 --> 30:13.876
No, it's definitely murder.

30:13.944 --> 30:15.544
Him and his wife.

30:15.612 --> 30:17.546
We got a suspect in custody.

30:17.614 --> 30:20.449
11447 Broadway. Cross street is Astoria.

30:20.517 --> 30:24.120
Ask him what Officer Koernig's
assignment was today.

30:24.187 --> 30:27.156
Please, innocent lives are at stake.

30:27.224 --> 30:29.492
What have you got to lose?

30:29.559 --> 30:31.928
And, sir?

30:31.995 --> 30:34.563
I need a lookup on
Koernig's duty assignment.

30:34.631 --> 30:38.267
Yeah, transfer me over.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.711
You screwed up. What?

30:48.779 --> 30:50.179
Yeah, surprised me, too.

30:50.247 --> 30:51.814
You forgot to upload a
Rijndael filter to my system.

30:51.882 --> 30:54.383
Without it, I can't break
the last encryption layer

30:54.451 --> 30:56.218
on the file remnant you gave me.

30:56.253 --> 30:57.820
I'm sorry. I will upload
it to a disk for you now.

30:57.888 --> 30:59.655
Or I can just do it at your station.

30:59.723 --> 31:02.224
Okay, fine.

31:06.830 --> 31:08.631
Everything okay?

31:08.699 --> 31:10.066
What do you mean? I don't know.

31:10.133 --> 31:12.234
It's not like you to make mistakes.

31:12.302 --> 31:14.136
You seem a little distracted.

31:14.204 --> 31:15.638
Wedding jitters, maybe?

31:15.706 --> 31:16.872
No.

31:16.940 --> 31:19.408
Just asking.

31:19.476 --> 31:21.143
And Cole's a nice enough guy.

31:21.211 --> 31:23.546
But I could see how you could
start having second thoughts.

31:23.613 --> 31:25.881
I've always been curious
to know what you two

31:25.949 --> 31:28.317
find to talk about. Drop this, Arlo.
I am not in the mood.

31:28.385 --> 31:30.086
Hey, I don't mean anything by it.

31:30.153 --> 31:31.587
All I'm saying is that you and the Boy Scout

31:31.655 --> 31:34.390
aren't exactly intellectual equals.

31:34.458 --> 31:36.525
Or is that what makes him your type?

31:38.295 --> 31:39.695
See now, you and me, for instance,

31:39.763 --> 31:40.997
we have a lot in common.

31:41.064 --> 31:43.566
We speak the same language.

31:43.633 --> 31:45.835
Mostly techno-jargon granted,
but hey, it can always lead

31:45.902 --> 31:47.403
to something much deeper. Damn it, Arlo!

31:51.008 --> 31:52.641
That's it.

31:52.709 --> 31:54.710
We've got it.

31:59.182 --> 32:00.983
Whoa. Is that what I think it is?

32:01.051 --> 32:02.985
Yes.

32:03.053 --> 32:05.488
Finish decrypting your fragment
and put it up on the screen.

32:05.555 --> 32:07.189
I've got to go tell Hastings.

32:07.257 --> 32:09.025
<i> I don't care what he's demanding.</i>

32:09.092 --> 32:11.560
Tell Ms. Reed's lawyer
he's going to have to wait.

32:11.628 --> 32:13.896
We can hold his client for up to 18 hours

32:13.964 --> 32:15.498
before formatly charging her.

32:15.565 --> 32:17.700
Sir? I have to go.

32:17.768 --> 32:20.069
We've broken the encryption
code on Reed's file.

32:20.137 --> 32:22.538
The primary file component's up on screen.

32:22.606 --> 32:25.541
Arlo's waiting for a second
piece to finish rendering.

32:25.609 --> 32:26.776
So, what am I looking at?

32:26.843 --> 32:28.744
Construction plans for work carried out

32:28.812 --> 32:30.780
at the United Nations eight months ago.

32:30.847 --> 32:32.648
The U.N.? Are you sure? Positive.

32:32.716 --> 32:35.751
Two I-beams were retrofitted
to provide structural support

32:35.819 --> 32:37.420
for additional interpreters' booths.

32:37.487 --> 32:39.955
There and there. That looks like

32:40.023 --> 32:41.257
the Council Chamber. It's directly below it.

32:41.324 --> 32:44.060
The decryption's just about complete.

32:44.127 --> 32:47.063
It's loading to the main screen now.

32:51.401 --> 32:52.802
It looks like a schematic for an incendiary.

32:52.869 --> 32:53.803
A bomb.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.037
Pulse-detonated,

32:55.105 --> 32:56.572
modified to fit between the I-beams.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.341
Sir, judging by the size, that's big enough

32:59.409 --> 33:01.477
to drop the entire Security Council

33:01.545 --> 33:02.611
into the East River.

33:02.679 --> 33:04.413
Get me Cole and Manners at the U.N.

33:05.382 --> 33:06.382
All stations!

33:06.450 --> 33:07.583
We're implementing protocols

33:07.651 --> 33:09.385
for an immediate evacuation

33:09.453 --> 33:11.520
of the United Nations building!

33:11.588 --> 33:12.822
We are Code Red.

33:12.889 --> 33:15.724
I repeat: This is not a drill.

33:15.792 --> 33:16.859
We are Code Red!

33:16.927 --> 33:17.927
Mr. Hastings, you need to consider

33:17.994 --> 33:19.261
the possibility that this intel is fake

33:19.329 --> 33:21.063
and why they wanted us to find it.

33:21.131 --> 33:22.331
I'm not taking any chances.

33:22.399 --> 33:23.365
Sir, I've got Cole and Manners on the line.

33:23.433 --> 33:25.701
Gentlemen, we have intel

33:25.769 --> 33:27.570
from the decrypted files

33:27.637 --> 33:28.838
that an incendiary device has been placed

33:28.905 --> 33:30.973
directly below the Council Chamber.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.842
S-Sir, I don't see how that's possible.

33:32.909 --> 33:33.843
This building's been

33:33.910 --> 33:34.844
vetted for weeks.

33:34.911 --> 33:35.845
U.N. security have swept the

33:35.912 --> 33:36.846
area thoroughly and repeatedly.

33:36.913 --> 33:37.913
Then they missed it.

33:37.981 --> 33:39.048
Mr. Manners,

33:39.116 --> 33:40.282
: you need to implement

33:40.350 --> 33:42.618
evacuation protocols immediately.

33:42.686 --> 33:45.488
Cole, I want you on President
Hassan, personally.

33:45.555 --> 33:46.555
Yes, sir.

33:46.623 --> 33:49.758
Hey! You, you, with me! Let's go!

33:53.063 --> 33:54.730
Ladies and gentlemen,
forgive the interruption.

33:54.798 --> 33:56.132
Your attention, please.

33:56.199 --> 33:57.433
We are evacuating

33:57.501 --> 34:00.302
immediately due to a possible bomb threat.

34:00.370 --> 34:01.904
Security personnel will be receiving

34:01.972 --> 34:04.974
protocol confirmation on
designated channels momentarily.

34:05.041 --> 34:07.543
Evacuation will proceed out these doors

34:07.611 --> 34:09.245
and down to underground parking level B.

34:09.312 --> 34:11.880
Please, speak only with your
designated handlers. Omar...

34:11.947 --> 34:13.081
Everything will be fine, Madam President.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.250
Madam President,

34:14.317 --> 34:15.784
you and Secretary Kanin need to move now.

34:15.851 --> 34:18.487
President Hassan, if you'll follow me.

34:22.859 --> 34:24.760
Traffic control, I need route
lockdown for northern exodus.

34:24.828 --> 34:26.027
All units confirm.

34:28.465 --> 34:30.366
MAN : Unit 2 in position.

34:30.433 --> 34:32.467
MAN 2 : Unit 3 in position.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.570
MAN 3 : Unit 4 in position.

34:34.638 --> 34:36.772
Unit 5 in position.

35:59.621 --> 36:01.255
Where are my wife and daughter?

36:01.323 --> 36:02.656
They're coming down the
east stairwell now, sir.

36:02.724 --> 36:04.959
No more than two minutes behind you.

36:05.026 --> 36:06.427
I won't leav without them.

36:06.495 --> 36:08.896
Mr. President, with all
due respect, my orders are

36:08.964 --> 36:10.231
to evacuate you now.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.733
Omar, I'll wait and go
with them. Don't worry.

36:12.801 --> 36:13.767
I'll make sure they're safe.

36:13.835 --> 36:15.803
Tarin, get my brother out of here.

36:23.211 --> 36:25.846
All right, evac tunnel B! Move!

36:40.161 --> 36:42.263
Yes?

36:42.330 --> 36:43.764
He's in the third car.

36:43.832 --> 36:45.866
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now.

36:47.536 --> 36:48.936
RADIO DISPATCH: Vehicles are in transit.

36:49.004 --> 36:50.938
Current location: evac tunnel bravo.

36:51.006 --> 36:55.442
Second Avenue teams should
have a visual in five minutes.

36:58.780 --> 37:00.414
Uncle! Where's Omar?

37:00.482 --> 37:02.182
He went ahead. We'll take the next car.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.218
Is it true there's a bomb?

37:04.286 --> 37:06.053
It's just a precaution, Kayla. Don't worry.

37:06.121 --> 37:07.221
Everything's going to be fine.

37:07.289 --> 37:08.856
Right this way.

37:08.924 --> 37:10.224
Okay. Let's be quick.

37:10.292 --> 37:12.293
Hurry.

37:14.863 --> 37:16.263
The guy who took his place?

37:16.331 --> 37:17.731
What was his name?

37:17.799 --> 37:18.933
WOMAN : Mike Farmer.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Thanks.

37:23.538 --> 37:26.407
Come on. Get out.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.780
You were right.

37:32.847 --> 37:35.516
There is a connection.

37:35.584 --> 37:37.785
Sergeant Koernig was on the U.
N. security detail.

37:37.852 --> 37:39.853
He called in sick about 45 minutes ago.

37:39.921 --> 37:41.655
He was forced to make that call.

37:41.723 --> 37:43.324
You said someone replaced him?

37:43.391 --> 37:45.526
A patrolman named Mike
Farmer from the same unit.

37:45.594 --> 37:46.794
That's your assassin.

37:46.861 --> 37:48.963
Officer, you need to let me call CTU,

37:49.030 --> 37:50.998
and I need to get to the U.N. immediately.

37:52.634 --> 37:54.234
Officer, this is going down now.

37:54.302 --> 37:55.603
You can either stand here and do nothing,

37:55.670 --> 37:56.804
or you can help me stop it.

37:58.206 --> 38:00.441
Make the call. I'll drive you to the U.N.

38:00.508 --> 38:01.875
Thank you.

38:07.716 --> 38:09.016
Where the hell you think you're going?

38:09.084 --> 38:10.150
He can't leave!

38:10.218 --> 38:11.485
He's a material witness!

38:33.241 --> 38:34.408
Jack, where have you been?

38:34.476 --> 38:35.609
Chloe, please just listen to me.

38:35.677 --> 38:36.977
The assassin killed a police officer

38:37.045 --> 38:38.646
and took his place in the U.
N. security detail.

38:38.713 --> 38:40.381
I need to alert Agent Ortiz immediately.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.949
Okay. I'll patch you through.

38:42.017 --> 38:43.350
He's in the middle of evacuating Hassan.

38:43.418 --> 38:45.352
Evacuating him? Why?

38:45.420 --> 38:48.022
Hastings' orders.
The evidence in Reed's computer

38:48.089 --> 38:49.056
indicated that there's a bomb

38:49.124 --> 38:50.157
in the building.

38:50.225 --> 38:51.425
Where's Hassan now?

38:51.493 --> 38:53.227
Hassan's motorcade is heading up the ramps

38:53.294 --> 38:55.329
in the parking garage,
about to pull out onto Second Avenue.

38:55.397 --> 38:57.665
Chloe, it's Cole. Hang on. I've got Cole.

38:57.732 --> 38:59.900
Agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer.

38:59.968 --> 39:01.201
What's going on, Jack?

39:01.269 --> 39:02.936
Oh, you need to stop Hassan's car now!

39:03.004 --> 39:04.171
What are you talking about?

39:04.239 --> 39:05.673
The assassin is part of
the evacuation detail.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.708
He's posing as an NYPD officer.

39:07.776 --> 39:09.109
There is no bomb in the U.N.

39:09.177 --> 39:10.544
They're just trying to lure
him out of the building.

39:10.612 --> 39:11.979
Did you tell Hastings about this?

39:12.047 --> 39:13.580
We don't have time.
You need to stop the motorcade

39:13.648 --> 39:15.683
before it hits the street.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.751
It's too late. Hassan's car
just exited the tunnel.

39:17.819 --> 39:19.920
Cole, you need to stop that
car or Hassan's a dead man.

39:22.590 --> 39:23.724
Cole?

39:30.665 --> 39:32.066
Whose vehicle is that?

39:33.835 --> 39:35.069
It's Cole, sir.

39:36.104 --> 39:37.504
Cole,

39:37.572 --> 39:38.939
what the hell are you doing?

39:39.007 --> 39:40.274
Cole!

40:02.097 --> 40:03.263
Cole!

40:06.768 --> 40:08.402
What was that?

40:08.470 --> 40:10.370
What happened?

40:10.438 --> 40:12.773
Cole, can you verify? Was Hassan hit?

40:14.178 --> 40:15.480
Cole!
