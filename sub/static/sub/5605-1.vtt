19:04.385 --> 19:06.918
Mike, I feel like
I'm losing your focus.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.720
You have family, too --
everybody in the store

19:09.722 --> 19:11.988
that cares about you --
Kyle, myself,

19:11.990 --> 19:13.856
even skip in
the loading dock.

19:13.858 --> 19:14.756
I fired skip.

19:14.758 --> 19:16.257
Forget about skip.

19:16.259 --> 19:18.826
Kyle and I are on the roof with
you in the path of a tornado.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.494
We care about you!

19:20.496 --> 19:21.828
And I care about you, too.

19:21.830 --> 19:23.596
So, what are we doing
on the roof?

19:23.598 --> 19:25.030
I got to get my family
out of here.

19:25.032 --> 19:26.698
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.832
I had one more speech in me,

19:27.834 --> 19:29.400
and then I was gonna hit him
with the hammer

19:29.402 --> 19:30.200
and drag him inside.

19:30.202 --> 19:30.934
Get in here.

19:35.173 --> 19:36.272
Wow.

19:36.274 --> 19:37.406
We were lucky.

19:37.408 --> 19:38.507
Yeah.

19:38.509 --> 19:40.775
None of the shirazis'
ugly Greek statues

19:40.777 --> 19:41.976
blew into our yard.

19:43.179 --> 19:44.111
Yeah.

19:44.113 --> 19:45.579
And Mr. Alzate and I
didn't die.

19:46.515 --> 19:48.681
Kristin,
I'm gonna revise

19:48.683 --> 19:51.050
that advice I gave you on the
honeymoon before, huh? Yeah.

19:51.052 --> 19:52.251
I just called Ryan.

19:52.253 --> 19:55.120
Told him we are going
as soon as he gets back.

19:55.122 --> 19:56.254
Good.

19:56.256 --> 19:57.722
You don't want
to get caught on a roof

19:57.724 --> 19:59.690
throwing rocks at a storm,
right?

20:00.726 --> 20:02.459
It happened before
you got there.

20:02.461 --> 20:04.427
It's about balance, Ed.

20:04.429 --> 20:05.895
Work is important,

20:05.897 --> 20:07.463
but you want it
to get in the way of family.

20:07.465 --> 20:09.198
Yeah,
'cause like dad taught us,

20:09.200 --> 20:11.800
family is the bomb...
Shelter.

20:11.802 --> 20:13.601
Boom!
Still got it.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.069
Boom.
Never had it.

20:15.071 --> 20:16.370
Ah.

20:16.372 --> 20:18.605
Cannot hurt my feelings
because you told me you love me.

20:18.607 --> 20:19.772
Mm.

20:19.774 --> 20:21.874
Well, Mandy and Eve
worked things out.

20:21.876 --> 20:24.476
Hmm. Well, the wolf
says you're welcome.

20:24.478 --> 20:25.777
Okay.

20:25.779 --> 20:28.112
But I want to talk about
the decorations in the bedroom.

20:28.114 --> 20:29.947
Oh, no, no, honey,
it was just a little project.

20:29.949 --> 20:31.415
There was no big thinking
behind it.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.784
Clearly.

20:33.786 --> 20:34.985
I don't care what
the bedroom looks like

20:34.987 --> 20:36.252
as long as we're in it
together.

20:36.254 --> 20:37.486
Right. Right. That's what
I was thinking. Yeah.

20:37.488 --> 20:40.222
I think we should take
another closer look at it,

20:40.224 --> 20:42.623
just you and me,
together.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.326
I think you are right.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.929
Girls, why don't you
go get us some food?

20:49.931 --> 20:51.597
We already got some.

20:51.599 --> 20:53.765
Get some more!

20:53.767 --> 20:56.400
Okay.
Uh, Kyle, can you drive?

20:56.402 --> 20:58.068
No, I don't think so.

20:58.070 --> 20:59.669
I want to take a look
at that bedroom.

21:01.572 --> 21:03.471
