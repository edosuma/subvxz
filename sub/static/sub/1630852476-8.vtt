00:01.210 --> 00:02.918
Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.962 --> 00:06.714
You'll tackle one
of the trickiest proteins
out there-- seafood.

00:06.716 --> 00:12.886
Gordon: At the end of today
the worst three dishes will
head into the elimination.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.305
Only one of you will come back.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.766
The winning dish in your mind?

00:17.852 --> 00:19.268
- The shrimp salad.
- Shrimp salad.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.353
Gordon:
Ae, congratulations, young lady.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.398
Jonathan, zach, you will
not be the next level chef.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.151
Listen carefully.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.486
Everything you know about
this competition

00:29.530 --> 00:32.322
is about to change.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.741
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:33.784 --> 00:35.701
It's time
to remove those aprons.

00:35.703 --> 00:39.288
From now on, you'll be
battling it out all alone.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.915
Ae:
<i> Teams are no longer existing.</i>

00:41.959 --> 00:42.958
Reuel:<i> It's wartime.</i>

00:43.002 --> 00:44.293
I can outcook these chefs.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.211
- Tricia, don't overdo it!
- ( bleep )

00:46.255 --> 00:47.796
pyet:<i> I put so much</i>
<i> of myself into this.</i>

00:47.798 --> 00:49.173
It's more than
a competition for me.

00:49.208 --> 00:50.340
Kenny:
<i> I got my kids to make proud.</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:52.217
I don't wanna do good.
I wanna win.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.137
Your climb to the top
starts today.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.786
Welcome back.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.788
Line up, please.
How we feeling?

01:20.790 --> 01:22.539
- Great.
- I'm good.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.540
Listen carefully.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.793
I told you all last time

01:25.795 --> 01:29.088
that the game
was about to change,

01:29.090 --> 01:32.049
and that starts right now.

01:32.093 --> 01:35.886
It's time to take
the training wheels off.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.180
I want all of you right now

01:38.182 --> 01:40.974
to remove those aprons.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.062
Because you won't
need them anymore.

01:45.106 --> 01:48.065
The team competition is over.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.776
I'm freaking out.
I'm panicking.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.611
<i> "chef, what's happening?"</i>

01:52.613 --> 01:57.074
over there in the back are
your new individual aprons.

01:57.118 --> 02:01.245
Time for you all to stand
on your own.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.289
From now on,
you'll be battling it out alone

02:04.333 --> 02:07.042
with no one to save you
from elimination.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.211
This is serious.
There's no more teams.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.171
<i> It's angie against the world.</i>

02:11.215 --> 02:13.966
But I think
I can outcook these chefs.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.927
Your climb to the top
starts today.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.296
From now on, where you cook

02:19.306 --> 02:23.267
will be determined on
how you cook.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.811
You cook well,
and you'll rise to the top.

02:25.855 --> 02:28.188
Make a mess of things,
and trust me,

02:28.232 --> 02:30.774
I promise you,
you will fall level by level

02:30.818 --> 02:32.442
all the way
down to the basement.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.195
Our bottom dishes compete
in the elimination.

02:35.281 --> 02:38.782
And those bottom dishes
could come from any level.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.076
- Is that clear?
- All: Yes, chef.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.871
Reuel:
<i> I feel in my element now.</i>
<i> It's wartime.</i>

02:43.906 --> 02:45.581
There's no more courtesy
involved.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.291
Please and thank you
will be at the end.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.877
<i> I hope I don't crush you</i>
<i> while I go up to the platform.</i>

02:49.920 --> 02:53.547
Now for today,
you will be placed on a level

02:53.591 --> 02:56.341
that is based off
of your specific performances

02:56.343 --> 02:58.177
in this competition so far.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.678
Richard, gordon, and myself

02:59.722 --> 03:02.097
have studied every
single one of your dishes

03:02.099 --> 03:04.099
and how much you've progressed

03:04.101 --> 03:05.726
right up to
that last seafood challenge.

03:05.769 --> 03:09.021
I cooked a disappointing dish
in the seafood challenge,

03:09.064 --> 03:11.190
so I could be cooking
in the basement again.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.859
While we're deciding
who should cook on what level,

03:13.903 --> 03:15.652
one thing that was very clear,

03:15.654 --> 03:18.989
everyone here needs to prove
that they're good enough

03:19.033 --> 03:20.199
to make that climb to the top.

03:20.242 --> 03:24.703
So today, that top level
kitchen is closed.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.332
Wow.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.835
You have to earn a place
in that top level kitchen.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.045
Interesting.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.088
<i> I have no choice</i>
<i> but to make it to the top.</i>

03:35.132 --> 03:36.965
The top level is closed
at this point.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.759
The goal is to open it.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.761
Richard: The chefs who
delivered the strongest dishes

03:40.763 --> 03:44.097
in the competition thus far
will cook on the middle floor.

03:44.099 --> 03:48.518
On the middle level today
will be pyet,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.187
tricia,

03:50.231 --> 03:52.397
reuel, and lastly...

03:54.526 --> 03:56.318
Courtney.

03:56.362 --> 03:57.486
Thank you.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.904
<i> It was not that long ago</i>

03:58.906 --> 04:01.531
<i> that I was</i>
<i> the last person selected,</i>

04:01.533 --> 04:03.283
and yet I'm here.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.326
I've grown.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.953
All right,
for the rest of you,

04:05.996 --> 04:09.915
kenny, mariah, angie, and ae,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.959
you'll be cooking
in the basement today.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.002
Mariah:
<i> I'm put in the basement.</i>

04:14.046 --> 04:15.295
Um, I don't know,
maybe because

04:15.297 --> 04:17.214
I forgot my dish
when I was in the basement?

04:17.216 --> 04:18.715
<i> I forgot to put it</i>
<i> on the platform.</i>

04:18.717 --> 04:20.801
So I'm like, is this,
like, punishment for that?

04:20.803 --> 04:21.802
I don't know.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.428
To get to the next level,

04:23.472 --> 04:26.265
you gotta prove that
you can master every protein.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.477
So, the star of today's dish

04:30.521 --> 04:32.729
is pork.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.566
Cooking pork can be
a dangerous game.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.861
You've got to coax
a lot of flavor
in a short amount of time.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.196
I'm gonna be in the middle,

04:41.240 --> 04:43.031
richard's gonna be
in the basement,

04:43.075 --> 04:45.575
and gordon's gonna flow
through both kitchens.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.829
We're all mentoring these chefs
as individuals now,

04:48.872 --> 04:50.831
<i> but this is still very much</i>

04:50.866 --> 04:53.583
<i> a competition between</i>
<i> gordon, richard, and myself.</i>

04:53.585 --> 04:56.753
I want to say that I picked
the next level chef.

04:56.755 --> 05:01.341
One last thing,
let's cut five minutes off
this cook time shall we?

05:01.385 --> 05:02.801
- What?
- No.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.636
- Sounds good.
- 40 minutes...

05:04.680 --> 05:05.554
- Okay.
- ( bleep )

05:05.597 --> 05:06.680
gordon:
...For your cook today.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.141
Okay, let's get going.
I am pretty excited myself.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.769
Reuel, tricia, pyet,
and courtney,

05:12.813 --> 05:14.813
please grab the keycard
on the right,

05:14.857 --> 05:17.065
and that'll take you
to the middle kitchen.
We'll see you soon.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.734
- Good luck, you guys.
- Gordon: Good luck.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.444
Good luck, good peoples.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.032
Showtime.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.121
Oh.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.498
Well, I'll take this one.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.250
No one is saying a word.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.170
Y'all know if there's
any meat tenderizers?

05:40.049 --> 05:43.050
<i> This is not</i>
<i> a team thing anymore.</i>

05:43.093 --> 05:44.301
You know, we used
to actually say a prayer

05:44.345 --> 05:45.719
for each other
in the elevator.

05:45.763 --> 05:49.181
There was none of that today.
No one was praying.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.099
They're probably praying
for my downfall.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.937
Right, the rest of you,
if I was in your shoes,

05:55.981 --> 05:57.773
- I'd wanna kick their asses.
- Oh, yeah.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.484
Grab that remaining keycard
and head into the basement.

06:02.863 --> 06:03.987
Richard: Good luck.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.781
Mariah:
<i> I'm here to be critiqued,</i>

06:05.824 --> 06:07.949
and if they think that
I need to start at the bottom

06:08.035 --> 06:09.159
<i> in order to make it</i>
<i> to the top,</i>

06:09.161 --> 06:10.118
then I'm fine with that.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.038
Do your thing.
Do your thing.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.209
It's all right, baby.
Cook, baby.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.920
<i> I believe that all four chefs</i>
<i> of that are on the bottom</i>

06:19.963 --> 06:22.631
have a chip on their shoulder,
because being on the bottom,

06:22.633 --> 06:25.133
that means that the other chefs
have produced better than you.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.552
<i> You know, you have to play</i>
<i> with a chip at this point</i>

06:27.596 --> 06:29.888
because if you don't have
a chip on your shoulder,
you might as well pack up.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.640
- Cook with love, baby.
- We got it.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.432
You can do what you want
in the middle.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.267
I'm gonna go skip
right over you.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.229
- I'm going to the top.
- Cook with love, baby.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.027
All right, let's go, everyone.
Let's go.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.822
Kenny, angie,
nice to finally get a chance

06:46.824 --> 06:48.657
- to be in the kitchen with
you while you're cooking.
- Yes, chef.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.244
Ae and mariah,
well, we've known each other
for a long time now.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.788
They're all individuals,
everyone's cooking
for themselves

06:54.832 --> 06:58.959
because whoever win this
will get mentorship
from us for a year.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.920
<i>But gordon, nyesha, and myself,</i>
<i> we're always gonna compete.</i>

07:01.922 --> 07:05.173
<i> So I still want the winner to</i>
<i> come from original team blais</i>

07:05.217 --> 07:08.260
so that I can say that I found
the next level chef.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.182
- Middle floor.
- Okay, guys, get excited.

07:14.217 --> 07:15.142
<i> At this stage</i>
<i> in the competition,</i>

07:15.436 --> 07:17.018
they're fighting and cooking
as individuals.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.229
This is it.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.190
And more importantly,
that nose to tail protein, pork,

07:22.234 --> 07:23.942
<i> it needs to be elevated,</i>

07:23.986 --> 07:26.069
and we're not just
gonna give $250,000

07:26.113 --> 07:28.113
to somebody that can cook
a piece of bacon.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.574
Here we go.
40 minutes now.

07:30.609 --> 07:34.995
Be smart with this pig.
The platform is moving.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.789
I'ma try not to push you
out of the way, pyet.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.000
- I'm fast.
Don't worry about me, baby.
- I know.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.169
- When big boy starts moving--
- don't worry about it.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.879
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.214
Do not send good cuts
to the basement.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.551
- Off you go, guys!
- Let's go!

07:49.595 --> 07:52.179
Tricia:<i> A really hoping</i>
<i> to get a fatty cut</i>
<i> like ground pork</i>

07:52.222 --> 07:55.974
because it's actually
very commonly used
in chinese cuisine.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.559
Courtney:
Anybody see a potato?

07:57.603 --> 08:00.562
I saw ground pork.
That's the first thing I grab.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.230
<i> It is perfect.</i>

08:02.232 --> 08:04.441
Plus, I didn't want tricia
to get that ground pork either.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.692
Okay. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.029
Oh, my god,
pyet is in front of me
playing, like, goalie,

08:09.072 --> 08:10.864
making sure
I don't touch anything.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.866
<i> And now</i>
<i> the ground pork is gone,</i>

08:12.951 --> 08:14.242
<i> so I grab pork tenderloin.</i>

08:14.286 --> 08:15.994
It's the leanest freaking cut.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.287
It has, like,
no ( bleep ) fat.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.415
Nyesha: You gotta want this!
Bring it to life!

08:20.459 --> 08:21.917
Platform's still here!
Grab what you need!

08:21.960 --> 08:24.085
Grab what you need!
Let's go, let's go!

08:24.129 --> 08:25.253
Apple? Apple, apple, apple.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.756
- Still here.
Grab what you need.
- Come on, guys.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.258
- Well done. Good.
- Nyesha: Only execute.
Let's go.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.136
All right, basement, go!

08:34.556 --> 08:35.847
All right, there we go.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.182
What do you need for your dish?

08:37.184 --> 08:40.310
I do cook this delicious
pork belly stir fry,

08:40.354 --> 08:42.979
so lo and behold,
I see the pork belly!

08:43.023 --> 08:44.648
<i> Thank buddha!</i>

08:44.691 --> 08:47.192
Richard: 20 seconds left.
Only 20 seconds.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.027
Oh, my gosh.
All these plates are empty.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.279
<i> I see two proteins</i>
<i> on the platform.</i>

08:51.323 --> 08:53.823
<i> They both were super thin,</i>
<i> no fat.</i>

08:53.867 --> 08:56.034
I grab thinly sliced pork loin.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.661
<i> Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>What am I gonna make with this?</i>

08:57.746 --> 08:59.871
Richard: There we go.
Way to make it happen.

08:59.915 --> 09:04.167
Five, four, three, two, one.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.337
If you can grab it, it's yours!
If you can grab it, it's yours!

09:07.381 --> 09:08.713
We'll figure out what to do
with the extra.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.091
All right, back to your station
and let's figure it out.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.051
- Ae can barely hold on
to that stuff.
- Behind you.

09:13.095 --> 09:16.346
Look at that!
Look at that, ae.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.223
Ae:<i> I look at</i>
<i> all the ingredients.</i>

09:18.267 --> 09:19.766
All the ingredients
are great for a stir fry,

09:19.768 --> 09:21.977
<i> but what does stir fry need?</i>

09:22.020 --> 09:24.020
I should've grabbed
some rice, man.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.232
<i> I have no rice.</i>
<i> That is the problem.</i>

09:27.234 --> 09:31.319
<i> At this point, I don't</i>
<i> even know what I'm gonna do</i>
<i> or how I'm gonna do it.</i>

09:31.363 --> 09:32.862
I just feel very insecure.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.990
I'm freaking the ( bleep ) out.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.453
40 minutes to go.
Let's go, basement.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.038
Start visualizing, y'all.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.624
Let's see.
Let me think, let me think,
let me think about this.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.544
You got sliced pork belly?
What are you thinking here?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.671
- I wanna do
a stir fry pork belly.
- Okay.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.340
But I couldn't find rice,
so I'm gonna create

09:52.342 --> 09:55.135
a type of veggie rice
with the veggies that I have.

09:55.178 --> 09:58.221
- I got a couple.
- All right, if you're gonna
sell us on a stir fry

09:58.223 --> 09:59.889
and a vegetable rice, you gotta
make it look like rice.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.351
Okay. Teams no longer exist,
so only I can save myself,

10:03.395 --> 10:05.228
<i> and I can't mess this up.</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:07.022
- Okay, I want you
to do well, all right?
- Yes.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.190
Okay, keep going.
Keep going over there.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.986
Let's go.
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.571
Courtney: Come on, court,
you got this.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.823
Gordon:
So you got the pork chop,
the pork cutlet.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.200
That is a beauty.
That's screaming cast iron pan
there, right?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.244
- Yes, yes.
- Basting, basting.
Good girl. Well done.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.914
What the ( bleep )
did you grab, bitch?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.916
Right, what did you grab?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.628
I have pork tenderloin,
carrot scallions, sage.

10:29.671 --> 10:33.548
Beautiful.
So, that loin, it's like
the filet mignon of pork.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.758
What kind of dish
are you gonna do?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.343
I wanna make pork wontons, chef.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.469
- Love that.
- It's my mom's recipe.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.637
- Mum's recipe?
- Yes.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.765
It used to be a family thing
before my grandparents passed

10:41.808 --> 10:44.851
<i> to all make these dumplings</i>
<i> or wontons together.</i>

10:44.895 --> 10:46.853
So it is something
that means a lot to me,

10:46.897 --> 10:48.438
and I really want
to do this well.

10:48.482 --> 10:49.898
I wanna make
some fried wontons

10:49.941 --> 10:51.107
for some crispiness
to put on top.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.693
Okay. I don't want to see three
or four renditions of this.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.404
- Do one stunning dish, okay?
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.990
- Good to see you here,
chef pyet.
- Thank you, chef.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.992
Pyet:<i> This competition</i>
<i> has been a rollercoaster.</i>

11:01.036 --> 11:02.952
One day you'll be on cloud nine

11:02.954 --> 11:04.996
thinking,
"I got this in the bag."

11:05.040 --> 11:05.955
<i> and then the next day</i>
<i> you're like,</i>

11:06.208 --> 11:09.250
"ooh, maybe we need
to humble yourself."

11:09.294 --> 11:11.670
<i> so to know that</i>
<i> I'm in that middle kitchen,</i>

11:11.713 --> 11:13.963
this is definitely making me
feel confident.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.840
- What cook did you get?
- I have a loin, chef.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.009
Gordon:
Wow. Loin. That's a big slab.
What are you gonna do with it?

11:18.095 --> 11:22.138
I'm gonna do it pan fried
with some spices,
some herbs on the outside,

11:22.140 --> 11:24.683
and then I'm going
to put some twine on it,
finish it off in the oven.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.142
Gordon: It's gotta get
in the oven as quick as you can.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.229
- Great choice of cut,
by the way. Really good.
- Thank you, chef.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.855
35 minutes to go.
Keep it going, yes?

11:30.899 --> 11:31.940
- Tricia: Yes, chef.
- Let's go.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.275
- How we doing, chef reuel?
- We're doing good.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.152
- Whatcha got?
- Ground shoulder.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.697
So what I'm gonna do
is a play on rasta pasta.

11:38.740 --> 11:43.827
- What is rasta pasta?
- Rasta pasta is an italian
play on flavors.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.286
You got spice,
you have peppers.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.830
- This is more
of a homey new dish.
- Beautiful.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.124
This is something I will make
after a late night of work.

11:49.126 --> 11:53.169
I'm starting to see
the cream rise to the top
in this competition,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.714
<i> and I have to say,</i>
<i> reuel's been there</i>
<i> since day one.</i>

11:55.757 --> 11:56.673
Where are you from originally?

11:56.925 --> 11:58.049
Trinidad and tobago.
You here the accent?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.551
Beautiful. Yes, totally.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.511
Do you cook trinidadian food
traditionally?

12:01.555 --> 12:02.429
I do.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.765
Pan-african food
needs to be explored more.

12:05.809 --> 12:09.352
<i> I'm trinidadian,</i>
<i> and I haven't been doing</i>
<i> the caribbean justice.</i>

12:09.396 --> 12:12.230
<i> My food was good,</i>
<i> but it was lacking my soul,</i>

12:12.274 --> 12:14.816
so I'm going to display
for the caribbean.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.985
- I can't to wait to see
some of that, chef.
- Yes.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.278
Let's go, basement.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.612
All right, kenny,
it's a pleasure.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.698
- I finally get to be
in the kitchen with you.
- Yes, chef.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.825
I've enjoyed your food.
Being that we're both dads,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.618
is this how you're throwing down
for the kids at home?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.996
- Uh, not really.
They like fast food.
- No?

12:27.998 --> 12:32.417
You know what?
I appreciate your honesty,
'cause it's the same way.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.670
Everyone thinks like, "oh,
your kids are eating foie gras
and bone marrow and caviar."

12:35.714 --> 12:38.673
- not even close.
- My kids are eating
chicken tenders, dude.

12:38.717 --> 12:42.802
Every day wake up,
I wanna do what's right
because my kids are watching.

12:42.846 --> 12:46.306
<i> I don't want them to say,</i>
<i> "daddy, you did good,</i>
<i> but you didn't win."</i>

12:46.349 --> 12:48.516
that's not the point.
I don't wanna do good.
I wanna win.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.312
<i> So I definitely</i>
<i> want the $250,000,</i>
<i> but if I do not win,</i>

12:52.314 --> 12:54.272
they're gonna know
I gave it everything I got.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.691
So I don't plan
on letting them down.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.277
- Do you have a concept yet?
- Yes, sir, I'm gonna do

12:59.279 --> 13:00.445
a pan-seared
center cut pork chop.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.322
And I'ma do a slow roast,
and then I'm gonna come back--

13:02.324 --> 13:03.698
- reverse sear?
- Reverse sear it, yes, sir.

13:03.742 --> 13:04.866
- A reverse sear?
- Yes, sir.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.035
Kenny:<i> Doing a reverse sear</i>
<i> just kind of helps me</i>

13:07.078 --> 13:08.286
<i> develop a different</i>
<i> type of flavor.</i>

13:08.622 --> 13:11.664
You slow cook it in the oven
till you get to a certain temp,

13:11.708 --> 13:14.167
pull it out
and give it a hard sear
to give it that crust on it.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.377
- Angie, how are you?
- Yes, sir.

13:16.421 --> 13:20.423
You gotta a pork t-bone.
They don't have a lot of fish
in texas, but how 'bout pork?

13:20.467 --> 13:23.009
Oh, we got pork for days.
I have a body built on pork.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.719
You and me both.
You and me both.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.888
Okay, so you got some
charred peppers working here.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.389
- Yes.
- Is that gonna be a sauce?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.849
- I'm developing that
in my mind.
- Okay.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.101
I'm trying to figure out how
to get that done down here
in the basement.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.978
I really want the poblano
to shine,

13:34.022 --> 13:36.022
<i> and I really think</i>
<i> it's going to.</i>

13:36.024 --> 13:37.774
<i> But I need to be working</i>
<i> my way up.</i>

13:37.859 --> 13:39.183
It's not okay to stay
in the bottom.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.861
All right, mariah,
so what is the plan here?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.571
You got sliced pork over here.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.699
I do. I'm thinking about
layering it up on some skewers.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.034
- Okay.
- And throwing it
on the grill.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.286
- Richard:
I like that very much.
- And then maybe glazing it,

13:50.330 --> 13:51.704
maybe doing, like,
an asian barbeque sauce.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.666
- Have you ever made
this type of dish before?
- No.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.377
<i> Everything I've made</i>
<i> up to this point,</i>
<i> I've never made before.</i>

13:57.420 --> 14:01.047
I go in with the intention
of just doing something fresh
and doing something new.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.801
<i>I know I really like channeling</i>
<i> international flavors,</i>

14:04.845 --> 14:08.221
and having all these
random ingredients
thrown at you all the time,

14:08.265 --> 14:11.307
I think it's
really pushed the boundaries
of my creativity.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.393
This is already the beginning
of the sauce for it?

14:13.436 --> 14:14.769
- Yes.
- Okay, great. So, again--

14:15.146 --> 14:17.355
- we got some honey
in there, gochujang.
- Bring these flavors.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.982
I love how you brought
morocco to the game.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.693
- Okay.
- It looks like we're seeing
some movement over here.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.238
All of you,
what goes well with pork?

14:25.282 --> 14:27.198
- Sauce.
- Sauce.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.950
- Peaches, apples.
- Peaches.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.785
When that platform comes down,

14:30.829 --> 14:33.788
15 seconds to grab
a stone fruit, guys,

14:33.832 --> 14:35.123
- the perfect compliment
with pork.
- ( bleep )

14:35.250 --> 14:38.585
- gordon: Here it comes.
- Nyesha: Intention, focus!

14:38.587 --> 14:41.045
Never in my life heard
anything called "stone fruit,"

14:41.089 --> 14:42.922
so I'm like, "what the hell
is a stone fruit?"

14:42.966 --> 14:46.217
- let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Gordon: Quick, quick, quick!

14:46.261 --> 14:50.221
Oh, it's just fruits.
It's not called stone fruit
in the grocery store.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.723
Nyesha: Let's go, guys.
Grab what you need!

14:51.766 --> 14:53.099
Gordon:
Tricia, wakey-wakey. Let's go.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.227
He's just stoning me to death
with this stone fruit.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.479
<i> I'm making chinese wontons</i>
<i> with chili oil.</i>

14:58.481 --> 15:00.899
<i> What the hell am I gonna do</i>
<i> with a plum?</i>

15:00.942 --> 15:04.110
- Four, three, two, one.
- Let's go, tricia.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.194
- Well done.
- Good job.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.237
Good. Right.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.530
Richard:
Guess what's coming down?

15:07.908 --> 15:11.492
You gotta go grab
at least one fruit
to work into your dish.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.119
There's some mangos and plums.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.914
Mariah:
<i> We have to use stone fruit,</i>
<i> which I'm excited about.</i>

15:15.957 --> 15:19.083
'cause I'm like, yes,
this gives me another element
of freshness to my dish.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.960
Richard:
Gotta grab some fruit.

15:21.004 --> 15:25.214
Five, four, three, two, one.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.842
Make sure you got something.
Make sure you got something.

15:27.886 --> 15:32.305
You grabbed
a plum and some prunes.
Great flavors for pork.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.849
Gordon: Well done.
29 minutes to go, okay?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.893
- Tricia, what'd you get?
- Plum and dried dates.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.021
I grab a plum because--
honestly, I don't know.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.898
Because I had plum yesterday
for dinner?

15:41.900 --> 15:44.192
But there was nothing
I could've grabbed that
would've fit in my dish.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.069
Gordon: How are you gonna
incorporate that stone fruit?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.904
Maybe make gastrique with it?

15:47.948 --> 15:51.115
I don't have anything acidic,
so a plum pickle?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.283
Yeah, I mean, be careful there.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.826
Remember what I said
about the simplicity.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.954
- Yes, chef.
- When you start getting
too complicated--

15:55.997 --> 15:57.080
- hey. Look at me.
- Not too complicated.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.665
- Your dna disappears.
- Yes, chef.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.042
One step at a time.
Don't start getting too clever.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.293
- Rein it in now.
- Yes, chef.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.171
<i> I wanna be</i>
<i> in the top kitchen so much,</i>

16:05.215 --> 16:07.590
but now I'm screwing up
something I ate
since I was a kid.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.466
Relax, relax.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.678
I'm so nervous
because immunity's gone.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.806
<i> I need to save myself,</i>
<i> but I don't know if I can.</i>

16:14.891 --> 16:17.392
Let's go.
Come on, tricia.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.148
- You have to breathe.
You have to breathe.
- I'm shaking.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.025
- Nyesha: I want you
to stop shaking.
- Tricia: Sorry.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.944
Okay. You got this, girl.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.529
I'm definitely
a little stressed.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.155
My hands are shaking
a little extra.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.659
Still at a little loss
what to do with the fruit, chef.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.620
- Okay, what do you have?
- Plums and dried dates, chef.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.705
The thing is,
you're gonna want to make sure

16:38.999 --> 16:41.791
that we see that plum
being used and not hidden.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.712
I needed some more flavor
to my wonton filling,

16:45.755 --> 16:49.257
<i> so I'm gonna just pickle them</i>
<i> and add them into my soup.</i>

16:49.300 --> 16:51.843
I'm wondering if I eat it,

16:51.928 --> 16:54.303
maybe they just won't know
it ever existed.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.848
- Don't stand in the way
of yourself, okay?
- Yes. I won't.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.516
You can do it.
You're here for a reason.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.093
- Thank you, chef.
- Okay? Hey, I want a little--

17:01.095 --> 17:03.187
yes! That's what
I'm talking about.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.023
- Confidence.
- Yes, chef.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.983
Talk to me about
your beautiful sauce here.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.194
So I'm literally
just sweating down peaches,

17:10.238 --> 17:13.698
mango, lime,
cherries, and medjool.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.951
23 minutes to go.
Still over halfway, guys, yes?

17:16.995 --> 17:18.494
Nyesha, you got two seconds?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.539
The top loin,
pyet went straight for it,

17:21.583 --> 17:23.541
which I don't know how
she's gonna get that cooked
in 40 minutes.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.002
If she gets that cooked right,
it could steal the show.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.086
Nyesha: Excellent.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.131
You were not lying at all
about tricia's nerves.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.175
- She is anxious in her cooking.
- Yeah.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.178
When she trips over is when
she overcomplicates things.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.222
Yes. Reuel said
he wants to bring more
of those trinny flavors.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.807
- Mm-hmm. Smart.
- I was a little bit surprised

17:39.851 --> 17:43.478
that he took the ground pork,
but he's meant to elevate that.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.480
Good. Halfway, guys.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.814
This is so close now.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.067
<i> We are halfway through,</i>
<i> so it's time for me</i>

17:49.110 --> 17:51.110
<i> to check out how they're doing</i>
<i> in the basement.</i>

17:51.154 --> 17:53.654
20 minutes remain.
Only 20 minutes.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.323
I don't even know
what the ( bleep )
I'm doing with this.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.658
So you got this vegetable rice.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.620
Yeah, put some panko in it too
to thicken it up.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.039
You're going to put breadcrumbs
in the vegetable rice?

18:03.083 --> 18:06.292
As someone
who eats vegetable rice
because I don't do carbs,

18:06.336 --> 18:08.920
I'd hate for someone
to put breadcrumbs in it.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.422
- Guys, we're halfway.
- What's up, chef?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.091
Well done, guys. 18 minutes.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.258
All right, give me an upload.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.135
All right,
lots of great ideas.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.762
Kenny's got, you know,
19 things working.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.223
- No! I told him edit it.
- In a good way. He's editing.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.892
Same thing with angie over here.
She's got a lot going on.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.811
She's got a pork t-bone
porterhouse.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.604
It's a big, thick, monster cut.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.773
- Gordon: Angie,
great choice of cut.
- Yes, chef.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.943
I look up, and oh, my gosh,
I'm cooking with chef ramsay.

18:31.986 --> 18:32.944
How are you gonna elevate this?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.070
I'm trying to pull off
a relleno.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.114
- Okay, in 40 minutes?
- I'm gonna try.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.156
- Wow, really?
- I've done it before.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.366
You're going all out,
aren't you?

18:38.409 --> 18:39.534
Angie:<i> Even though</i>
<i> I cooked in the basement</i>

18:39.619 --> 18:42.036
<i> with him the first time,</i>
<i> I'm so nervous.</i>

18:42.080 --> 18:44.247
<i> I mean, when you</i>
<i> only see him on tv,</i>

18:44.290 --> 18:47.083
you don't realize
he's built like a god.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.918
Need some heat in there, no?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.002
Angie:<i> I get really nervous</i>
<i> when he's in the kitchen</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:51.129
<i> 'cause I don't want to cook.</i>

18:51.506 --> 18:54.924
I just wanna stare at him
and grab his biceps really.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.719
That's the money there, okay?
They need to brushed
and basted, okay?

18:58.805 --> 18:59.846
Otherwise they're gonna go dry.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.097
<i>But I don't have time for this.</i>

19:01.141 --> 19:03.015
I've got a competition to win.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.103
- Right, my man,
what did you grab?
- How we doing, chef?

19:07.147 --> 19:09.105
I got a center cut pork chop.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.940
I got some pinot noir,
some bourbon.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.276
Good. 11 minutes to go.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.319
Richard, wow.
Man, there's some
cooking in here.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.488
- Yes.
- Kenny's got the loin.
Almost like a pork chop.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.574
Richard:
He's doing the reverse sear.
I'm not sure about that.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.491
Just put it in the pan,
let it rest.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.617
But it needs to be doused
with butter.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.453
He needs fat in there,
otherwise it's gonna go too dry.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.123
- What's going down?
- Hey.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.000
Nyesha: Poached?
You got a little acid in there?

19:29.043 --> 19:30.918
Vinegar.
Don't judge me now.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.129
Never. It's only my job.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.050
So you woke up
and you choose to be
this way today. I see.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.844
Nyesha:
Guys, we have ten minutes!

19:39.888 --> 19:42.847
That's why
I didn't see the potatoes.
They're over at your station!

19:42.891 --> 19:46.475
In my mind, I have this idea
of these potatoes that
I've made in the past.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.144
<i> It cooks down</i>
<i> and crisps to the point</i>

19:48.563 --> 19:51.606
<i> where you can actually</i>
<i> see through the potato</i>
<i> because of how thin it's cut.</i>

19:51.649 --> 19:54.025
<i> These potatoes</i>
<i> are what's going to bring</i>
<i> this dish to life.</i>

19:54.068 --> 19:55.318
- You check your pork?
- Yes.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.236
- Make sure
you're rotating that.
- Yes, chef.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.907
It's clear to me that pyet
is a strong force.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.327
<i> She has a relentless will</i>
<i> to get better.</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:06.454
Make sure
it's cooked thoroughly.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.959
Ooh! Oh, my god.

20:12.003 --> 20:13.294
Fire in the basement!

20:13.296 --> 20:14.795
Richard:
You got a little fire over here.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.255
- Mariah: Okay.
- You keep going.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.466
- So many fires down here.
- Basement.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.675
Richard:
We're plating very soon, right?

20:19.761 --> 20:20.676
- Yes, chef.
- Yes.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.261
Gordon:
Two minutes to go, guys.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.263
Boy, oh, boy, you should see
the dishes downstairs.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.891
- Nyesha: Start plating!
- Ahh!

20:26.935 --> 20:29.310
Now the finishing magic
comes in, please, courtney?

20:29.354 --> 20:31.520
- Yes.
- Good girl. Take your time.
Take your time.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.189
Hone it in. Bring it home.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.441
- Beautiful.
- Yes. Excellent.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.819
They're just too thin.
They were too thin.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.571
I pulled out my potatoes.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.614
A stupid mistake.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.574
<i> And I can't even pull</i>
<i> the parchment paper</i>

20:43.618 --> 20:45.993
apart off of it
to even put it on the dish.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.288
Pyet, if you keep on
forgetting your dish

20:49.332 --> 20:50.623
and you mess around
with the garnish,

20:50.667 --> 20:52.083
I'm gonna get really,
really frustrated.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.709
Heard, chef.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.211
<i> I don't have much time left.</i>

20:55.255 --> 20:58.047
I have to completely just
get rid of the potatoes.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.925
<i> I have to revert</i>
<i> to the carrot corn</i>

21:00.960 --> 21:02.134
<i> and then the stupid broccoli.</i>

21:02.178 --> 21:05.513
My excitement for this dish
is dying.

21:05.515 --> 21:06.889
75 seconds to go.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.601
- Okay.
- Last edits right here.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.520
- Oh, my god,
that looks delicious.
- Thank you, chef.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.688
Richard: You gotta
just make sure this is tight.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.982
- Kenny: For sure, chef.
- That looks glossy.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.692
You're selling it to me, ae.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.653
Pulling a rabbit
out of the hat again
perhaps over here.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.155
<i> Ae's dish is looking good.</i>
<i> Mariah's dish is looking good.</i>

21:23.157 --> 21:26.867
The two chefs that I drafted,
I hope they can get
to the top level.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.203
40 seconds left.
Platform is on the move.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.206
Get ready to move with it.
Mariah, are you gonna make it?

21:32.208 --> 21:35.209
- Yes, chef!
- 30 seconds.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.628
( bleep ). That's hot.

21:37.672 --> 21:40.131
The platform is here! You gotta
get your plate over there.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.257
- 15 seconds left!
- Let's go, girls.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.301
- Richard: Ae, let's go!
- Kenny: Come on, ae, baby.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.929
- Come on, ae, baby.
- Angie, kenny, let's go.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.016
Seven, six, five,

21:50.059 --> 21:53.978
- four, three, two, one.
- It looks amazing.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.604
- Nothing you can do now.
- Looks amazing.

21:55.606 --> 21:58.357
- Damn, yours looks good, girl.
- Looks amazing.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.735
- It looks amazing.
- Gordon: 25 seconds.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.611
Lovely, now clear the plate.
Now put some more slices
on top of that.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.072
Sandwich it. Well done.
20 seconds to go.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.574
Tricia, don't overdo it!

22:06.576 --> 22:09.535
- Nyesha:
Platform's here, team!
- 15 seconds to go.

22:09.579 --> 22:10.453
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- Less is more, girl.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.705
- Clear your plate. Let's go!
- Nice.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.082
- Eight. Please.
- Platform's here.
Let's go, chefs.

22:15.084 --> 22:18.085
- Seven, six, five...
- Push, push, push.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.088
...Four, three, two, one.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.342
And stop. Well done!

22:25.303 --> 22:27.470
When that garnish isn't on--

22:27.513 --> 22:28.763
messing around all that time,
and if I was gonna

22:28.798 --> 22:31.557
crisp those potatoes,
I'd stick them on top.

22:31.601 --> 22:35.311
It looked beautiful,
but don't get caught
on the garnish.

22:35.355 --> 22:39.023
Pyet:<i> I got thrown off</i>
<i> by a small detail,</i>

22:39.067 --> 22:40.900
and now I'm feeling
a little vulnerable.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.818
Like, I'm not feeling
as strong and confident.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.322
How many times in our kitchens
do we have to say,
"let go of it."

22:46.366 --> 22:48.157
- yes. Every single time.
- You're right, chef.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.076
Because it's not the hero.
The hero's the pork.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.952
After that,
it's the stone fruit.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.163
And if you're gonna
crisp up the potato,
you don't sit it underneath.

22:54.207 --> 22:57.917
I put so much of myself
into this,

22:57.960 --> 23:00.711
so it's more than
a competition for me.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.851
Right, we've always told you
that you're only as good

23:15.895 --> 23:18.104
as your last dish
in this competition.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.023
We now need to decide
for the next challenge
whether any of these dishes

23:21.067 --> 23:23.651
warrant a spot
on the top level,

23:23.694 --> 23:26.862
and which dishes will end up
on the middle level,

23:26.906 --> 23:29.782
and sadly,
which unfortunate dishes

23:29.784 --> 23:31.659
will go into the elimination.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.915
Okay, richard,
should we go to the basement?

23:37.959 --> 23:42.002
First up,
this sort of shingled skewer
korean barbeque,

23:42.046 --> 23:47.258
kansas city barbeque inspired,
so kkcbbq.

23:47.301 --> 23:48.968
Mariah:
<i> I so want to go to the top.</i>

23:49.011 --> 23:50.970
<i> I need just</i>
<i> that little bit extra</i>

23:51.013 --> 23:52.638
<i> to get me out of the basement</i>

23:52.682 --> 23:54.849
and to prove that my dish
is worthy to be on top.

23:54.892 --> 23:57.268
<i> So this moment is everything.</i>

23:59.605 --> 24:04.525
So innovative to retain
the moisture in that pork by
layering in that fresh fruit.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.610
- Great idea.
- Pork's cooked delicious.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.195
It's got that crispy texture
on the outside

24:08.197 --> 24:11.866
with that amazing
caramelized barbeque flavor.

24:11.909 --> 24:15.911
I was forced to use something
and created something magical.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.413
I'm feeling on top of the world.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.166
All right, here we go,

24:20.168 --> 24:25.087
a pork t-bone
with a chili relleno.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.339
I personally would've rather
dropped the chili relleno,

24:27.383 --> 24:29.133
focused on the garnish,
the stone fruit, the pork.

24:29.594 --> 24:34.722
I would've liked a little bit
more seasoning on the pork,
but it's cooked beautifully.

24:34.724 --> 24:38.934
The next dish,
pork loin with a reverse sear.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.978
It's slightly dry.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.983
Richard: Unfortunately
the pork's a little bit dry.

24:46.027 --> 24:48.110
Gordon: That reverse sear's
so dangerous.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.362
A reverse sear
is generally for ribeye,

24:50.364 --> 24:51.864
something
that's generous in fat,

24:51.908 --> 24:53.157
and there's hardly any fat
in there.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.744
The hero's the pork,
and unfortunately
that's underwhelming.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.288
Damn.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.206
<i> Well, at this point</i>
<i> in the competition,</i>

25:00.249 --> 25:01.624
<i> mistakes are unacceptable.</i>

25:01.626 --> 25:05.961
All right, next,
pork belly vegetable fried rice

25:05.963 --> 25:09.006
and zucchini, cabbage,
some breadcrumbs.

25:14.764 --> 25:17.932
There's, like, a wet sense,
it just-- yeah, it doesn't work.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.101
If you're gonna sell me
on a rice dish that does not
have rice in it,

25:21.187 --> 25:23.938
it better be
the most impeccable fried rice.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.857
It should have elements of
crunchiness and crispiness,
right?

25:26.901 --> 25:28.943
But this is very soft
throughout.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.029
I tried to make it
compact and cute,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.155
and it backfired on me.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.991
What a shame. Next.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.826
Nyesha, shall we?
Middle floor.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.163
Here we have
a pork tenderloin wonton

25:41.165 --> 25:42.998
with mushrooms and chili oil.

25:46.796 --> 25:50.756
I'm just surprised that
the stone fruit was not
more prevalent in this dish.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.925
To me, the broth, I would've
loved to see it punched up
a little bit more

25:52.969 --> 25:55.094
because, you know,
the tenderloin wants
some flavor.

25:55.137 --> 25:58.222
There's not a lot
of flavor in it as is.

25:58.266 --> 26:01.225
I just really wanted to push
making a chinese dish today,

26:01.269 --> 26:05.145
and I'm wondering if
I tried to push the story
a little too hard.

26:05.189 --> 26:09.567
Here we have
a roast pork loin.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.570
I love the flavor
of the chutney and the gravy.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.113
I wish there was more
of both of those things.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.323
Chutney is magnificent.
I love that chutney.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.118
And it lifts that pork with
the acidity and the sweetness.

26:21.122 --> 26:24.081
Next, here we have
a rasta pasta.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.625
This is a gnudi
with a pork ragu.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.919
The flavors of the broth and
everything else comes together.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.838
- It's a delicious dish.
- It's got heart.

26:30.881 --> 26:33.215
There is a lot of skill
going on in there.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.466
Reuel:<i> I am super excited.</i>

26:34.468 --> 26:35.676
<i> This is me on a plate,</i>

26:35.720 --> 26:38.762
so to be able
to translate that is surreal.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.682
Next up,
we have a roast pork loin.

26:41.684 --> 26:46.061
Visually, to be honest,
this has got cruise ship
buffet vibes going on.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.986
It is cooked properly,

26:54.030 --> 26:55.029
it's just sliced too thin.

26:55.323 --> 26:59.867
It just needs body and flavor,
and it's lacking.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.828
I'm not inspired
to enjoy this dish at all.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.080
<i> I drafted pyet for a reason.</i>

27:05.124 --> 27:06.290
<i> She's got raw talent,</i>

27:06.292 --> 27:08.000
but it's my job that make sure

27:08.002 --> 27:10.878
that I spark that inspiration
in her soul.

27:10.921 --> 27:15.299
Pyet needs to produce dishes
that move her up in this
competition, not down.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.179
This is tough. Shall we?

27:25.353 --> 27:27.895
This competition was
never set out to be easy.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.521
<i> The big question is</i>
<i> how many dishes</i>

27:29.565 --> 27:31.940
<i> have earned a spot</i>
<i> in that top level kitchen,</i>

27:31.984 --> 27:36.570
<i> and sadly,</i>
<i> which ones will be heading</i>
<i> into the elimination.</i>

27:36.572 --> 27:40.074
Some of the highlights
of tonight were done
with the cheaper cuts.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.660
The korean
kansas style barbeque.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.621
- Nyesha: Mind blowing.
- The t-bone was cooked
really well.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.248
Nyesha: Absolutely.
Just a little bit of editing,
did they need the chili relleno

27:48.292 --> 27:49.958
- and the mashed potato?
- Gordon: No. No.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.544
That double pork chop
on the bone?

27:52.588 --> 27:55.756
It was pretty good.
Like, totally under promise,
over deliver.

27:55.758 --> 27:59.968
- Rasta pasta?
- I didn't think ground pork
could be that elevated.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.130
The underwhelming performances--

28:03.140 --> 28:05.849
the top loin, not very good.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.060
- So disappointed.
- What is yours?

28:08.145 --> 28:10.813
The one that nyesha
( bleep ) hates.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.439
No rice fried rice,

28:12.483 --> 28:14.525
- that was very, very strange.
- Richard: Yeah.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.652
I thought I redeemed myself,
but now I'm whack again.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.154
There's just no flavor
from that dumpling, was there?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.864
- No.
- It was mealy.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.324
Richard: But the effort
should be applauded.

28:23.411 --> 28:24.827
( bleep )

28:24.829 --> 28:26.328
the reverse sear,
you don't do that

28:26.330 --> 28:28.080
with something
that's got no fat in there.

28:28.082 --> 28:31.166
It's a thin piece of steak.
Roast it beautifully.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.252
- Shame on me.
- I'm sorry, dawg.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.505
Everyone has an off day,
but an off day today
could send you home.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.297
Absolutely.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.841
<i> There's nowhere to hide.</i>

28:38.884 --> 28:41.343
You're not with your team,
you're cooking as an individual,

28:41.387 --> 28:43.721
<i> and you want to give yourself</i>
<i> every tool for success.</i>

28:43.764 --> 28:47.266
<i> I'd want to be in</i>
<i> that top kitchen to make</i>
<i> the most successful dish.</i>

28:47.309 --> 28:49.226
Okay, let's get down
to business.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.812
There were only two dishes
that were good enough

28:51.856 --> 28:52.771
to make it to the top.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.064
Wow.

28:54.108 --> 28:57.901
The first dish was brave,
slightly tenacious,

28:57.945 --> 29:00.237
but it hit all the right notes.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.114
And that dish was the--

29:02.116 --> 29:04.616
the barbeque pork skewers.

29:04.618 --> 29:08.328
- Oh. Are you serious?
- Congratulations, mariah.

29:08.330 --> 29:11.039
- Way to go, girl.
They're delicious.
- Gordon: Well done.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.583
That was crazy.
Thank you, chef.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.960
<i> My confidence level going</i>
<i> into the next challenge</i>

29:15.004 --> 29:16.044
<i> is nice and high.</i>

29:16.088 --> 29:17.463
And there are
probably some people

29:17.506 --> 29:18.797
who wanted me to go home.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.007
<i> But now</i>
<i> I'm in the top kitchen?</i>

29:20.050 --> 29:21.216
Oh, it's game on.

29:21.594 --> 29:25.888
The second and final dish that
cooked their way to the top,

29:25.931 --> 29:27.931
the ground pork gnudi.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.349
Congratulations, reuel.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.935
You elevated ground pork
to the next level.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.188
Congratulations,
mariah, reuel.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.982
You're starting
at the very top.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.484
- Well done.
- Thank you, chef.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.612
Now there were three
not quite the next level,

29:41.655 --> 29:44.823
but good enough to stay
on the second level.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.326
The first dish is

29:47.328 --> 29:50.120
the double pork chop
and the chutney.

29:50.164 --> 29:51.246
Courtney, well done.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.832
- Thank you.
- Second dish.

29:54.794 --> 29:58.337
Chili relleno.
Congratulations, angie.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.756
Yeah!

30:00.758 --> 30:02.841
Now only one more dish

30:02.885 --> 30:05.093
will go into
the middle kitchen next time.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.930
The rest of you will be headed
to elimination.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.975
I'm worried about going into
the elimination challenge.

30:12.019 --> 30:15.896
I'm feeling proud of myself
for what I have been able to do
in this competition,

30:15.940 --> 30:17.773
<i> but I'm not ready to go home.</i>

30:17.775 --> 30:19.066
I wanna win this thing.

30:19.068 --> 30:22.277
The final dish is...

30:29.328 --> 30:33.163
Only one more dish will go into
the middle kitchen next time.

30:33.207 --> 30:36.291
The rest of you will be headed
to elimination.

30:38.295 --> 30:41.797
The third and final dish is

30:41.841 --> 30:44.216
the tenderloin wontons.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.220
- Good job, tricia.
- You know when those nerves go,

30:48.264 --> 30:50.722
you're unstoppable, okay?

30:50.766 --> 30:52.349
- Great job.
- Thank you, chef.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.559
<i> I might be safe,</i>

30:53.602 --> 30:56.395
but I need to stop shooting
to just survive.

30:56.438 --> 30:59.231
<i> I wanna keep striving</i>
<i> to do my very best.</i>

30:59.275 --> 31:01.525
Mama wang ain't raise
no second place bitch.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.985
Now unfortunately,

31:03.028 --> 31:06.822
that means the pork loin,

31:06.866 --> 31:09.157
the reverse seared center cut,

31:09.201 --> 31:12.160
and the pork belly
stir fry no rice

31:12.195 --> 31:15.122
are all heading
to the basement,

31:15.165 --> 31:17.916
but not before you all face off

31:17.960 --> 31:19.084
in the elimination cook-off.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.880
Sadly, one of you
will be leaving
this competition.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.549
Everyone else,
head to the lift.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.135
- I'm sorry.
- Kenny:<i> The whole point</i>
<i> of this competition</i>

31:28.178 --> 31:29.887
is to go up, you know,
and I'm going backwards.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.097
<i> I do believe</i>
<i> I'm the best chef,</i>

31:32.099 --> 31:33.974
but this right here
is that reality check.

31:35.144 --> 31:37.311
Today's performance
wasn't your best.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.438
Now for tonight's
elimination cook-off,

31:39.523 --> 31:41.023
nyesha, richard, and myself

31:41.483 --> 31:45.319
want to give you all
the very best opportunity
to create a next level dish

31:45.362 --> 31:48.947
because the ingredient
you'll be using is bacon.

31:49.033 --> 31:51.950
Richard will be
in the kitchen with you.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.995
From now on
until we reach the finale,

31:55.039 --> 31:57.915
each of us
will take one turn

31:57.958 --> 31:59.249
overseeing
the elimination cook-off

31:59.335 --> 32:02.252
while the other two
will blindly taste the dishes.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.963
All three of you, good luck.
Head over to the lift.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.758
See you soon.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.801
I was just ( bleep ) here.

32:09.845 --> 32:10.719
I beat out two people.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.721
And then to be in
the elimination again?

32:12.765 --> 32:14.264
<i> It's crazy.</i>

32:19.146 --> 32:22.773
- Cool.
- I'm definitely coming
to kick some ass.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.317
<i> I'm up against two</i>
<i> extremely talented people,</i>

32:25.319 --> 32:29.196
so I have to do everything I can
to stay in this competition.

32:32.117 --> 32:32.991
I got my kids to make proud.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.953
<i> Nothing against</i>
<i> chef pyet and chef ae,</i>

32:35.996 --> 32:37.913
<i> but you're not gonna take</i>
<i> food off my table.</i>

32:37.957 --> 32:39.331
Sorry.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.876
Richard: Okay, everyone,
how are we doing?

32:42.878 --> 32:43.877
Everyone's cooking
for themselves,

32:43.921 --> 32:46.964
but I still want ae,
og team blais,

32:47.007 --> 32:48.215
<i> to win this and pull through.</i>

32:48.258 --> 32:50.008
<i> But I'm impartial as a judge,</i>

32:50.052 --> 32:51.301
<i> and whoever</i>
<i> does make it through,</i>

32:51.345 --> 32:53.220
they have
a big uphill climb ahead

32:53.263 --> 32:54.805
because they'll be
in the basement next time.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.350
30 minutes to cook.
You know the theme. It's bacon.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.228
Here we go. Go time.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.023
Pyet:
<i> I'm hoping to find scallops.</i>

33:05.067 --> 33:06.692
I wanna do
a bacon-wrapped scallop.

33:06.735 --> 33:10.612
<i> I would say that I am</i>
<i> a bit of a scallop queen.</i>

33:10.614 --> 33:13.865
So I have perfected
cooking with scallops.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.826
Richard: Of course,
your dish needs bacon.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.786
And just be mindful,
those scallops are pretty big,

33:17.830 --> 33:20.122
but you don't want to overcook
them in the bacon, okay?

33:20.124 --> 33:21.289
Correct, chef.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.667
Richard:
Kenny with a quick call
right there. I like it.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.711
He's got some cheese,
got some parm, it looks like,

33:25.754 --> 33:27.629
some bacon, some peas.

33:27.631 --> 33:30.215
Hmm, the ingredients sound
pretty familiar, kenny.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.633
You tell me what it is.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.219
- Sweet pea gnocchi.
- Sweet pea gnocchi?

33:34.263 --> 33:36.722
- Oh! That wasn't
what I was thinking.
- Okay. All right.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.181
I was thinking
maybe a carbonara.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.850
Richard: I was thinking
carbonara as well.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.101
It's more on
the cavatelli side.

33:41.145 --> 33:44.271
Oh, you cook how my body likes!

33:44.314 --> 33:48.233
Not a lot of time
to make cavatelli, right?

33:48.235 --> 33:51.028
To bake cavatelli from scratch
is, like, a bold, bold move,

33:51.071 --> 33:52.446
especially in 30 minutes.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.823
<i> I know I would not</i>
<i> be able to do it.</i>

33:55.868 --> 33:56.950
Richard:
What are we thinking over here?

33:56.994 --> 33:58.326
My version of drunken noodles,

33:58.328 --> 33:59.953
but I'm gonna use spaghetti

33:59.997 --> 34:01.246
and get some of
this bacon grease,

34:01.290 --> 34:03.206
make bacon chili oil
out of it.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.751
Okay, are you incorporate
the bacon in another way?

34:05.794 --> 34:08.003
Yes, I'm gonna do
the bacon as a protein.
The bacon is the focus.

34:08.047 --> 34:11.298
- Okay, get going.
Only 30 minutes.
- I'm actually feeling good.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.551
<i> I don't want to focus</i>
<i>on any other protein but bacon.</i>

34:14.595 --> 34:17.012
Other eliminations,
they have said,
"this overpowered this.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.182
You shouldn't have added this."
I was like, "it's gonna be
bacon, bacon, bacon."

34:20.225 --> 34:22.017
- they got a lot of good stuff.
- Classic.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.728
- Ooh.
- There you go, kenny.
Good job, kenny.

34:24.772 --> 34:26.855
When it was teams,
it was a lot louder over here
in the gallery.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.816
- Right, right, right.
- Now that it's everyone
for themselves--

34:29.818 --> 34:30.817
I think everybody's locked in
on their dish.

34:30.986 --> 34:33.487
- Well, I love that.
-<i> Um... ( laughs )</i>

34:33.489 --> 34:35.614
I ain't gonna say ( bleep ).

34:35.616 --> 34:38.784
<i> I'm like,</i>
<i> "every chef for themselves."</i>

34:38.827 --> 34:40.744
ten minutes are down
already, okay?

34:40.788 --> 34:41.995
Have you done this before?

34:42.081 --> 34:42.954
- Yeah, I have, chef.
- Okay, got it.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.915
I'm gonna steer the end
that's folded first

34:44.958 --> 34:46.666
so it kinda create,
like, a crest on it.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.920
Richard: Make it tight and
beautiful. You've got a lot of
elements going on over here.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.214
Yes, chef.
I am hoping and praying

34:52.257 --> 34:54.299
that my scallops
don't overcook

34:54.301 --> 34:58.136
<i> because there's</i>
<i> nothing worse than serving</i>
<i> an overcooked scallop.</i>

34:58.180 --> 35:01.098
I'm also hoping
that my bacon stays crispy

35:01.141 --> 35:03.058
<i> and it doesn't burn.</i>

35:04.561 --> 35:05.644
Kenny, all right,
so you're working peas
into the dough.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.897
I love of that.
You are ambitious
as always, kenny.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.065
That sounds delicious.

35:10.359 --> 35:13.193
It does,
but with your time restraints,
I don't know.

35:13.195 --> 35:16.071
At this point, a good dish
from a great dish,

35:16.115 --> 35:17.656
<i> it's really about precision.</i>

35:17.699 --> 35:20.283
<i> The margins are getting</i>
<i> very, very thin,</i>

35:20.327 --> 35:23.286
<i> and the details,</i>
<i> we're just looking</i>
<i> at every single one.</i>

35:23.330 --> 35:27.124
- Good call, good call.
- Yeah, okay. All right!

35:30.045 --> 35:31.753
Yeah, something smells
like it's burning.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.048
Something smells
like it's burning.
Not sure what it is.

35:35.092 --> 35:38.301
I'm a little bit worried
about her scallops.
Are they gonna be okay?

35:39.263 --> 35:41.138
That's a lot of heat
on scallops.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.267
If this is what makes me
go home, I'll be pissed.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.727
- Angie: We good?
- I don't know.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.104
Angie: Pyet,
are your scallops okay?

35:51.358 --> 35:53.191
Stupid. A stupid mistake.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.075
Mariah: Something smells
like it's burning.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.326
Angie: Pyet,
are your scallops okay?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.372
There are one or two
that didn't come out perfect,

36:07.416 --> 36:10.125
but at this point,
I have to keep moving forward.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.127
And guess what, I've got more.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.253
- You cooked an extra one?
- Yep.

36:13.297 --> 36:15.213
I love it.
Final five minutes.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.757
You gotta be thinking about
what this looks like on a plate.

36:17.801 --> 36:22.888
Gordon and nyesha,
they wanna see three
next level dishes, okay?

36:22.931 --> 36:23.930
Is it good, kenny?

36:23.974 --> 36:25.765
( whistles )

36:25.809 --> 36:27.309
I think it's good.

36:27.311 --> 36:29.186
I have not made cavatelli
from scratch,

36:29.229 --> 36:31.021
<i> but it's game time</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

36:31.064 --> 36:32.272
<i> I cut it small enough</i>

36:32.316 --> 36:33.899
<i> so I don't have to</i>
<i> cook it as long</i>

36:33.942 --> 36:34.691
and get some of that
fluffiness in there.

36:34.985 --> 36:35.984
This is gonna come down
to how well

36:36.445 --> 36:38.570
those scallops are cooked
and how delicious that sauce is.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.654
- I love it. I love it.
- Great.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.199
- If you love it,
they're gonna love it.
- Oh, ae.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.868
Damn, I'd eat that
all day long, ae.

36:44.912 --> 36:48.121
All right, here we go.
How are the drunken noodles?

36:48.165 --> 36:50.123
- It's cool.
- Okay, you got a little
texture over here?

36:50.167 --> 36:51.875
Yes, pine nuts. I have
roasted pine nuts on there.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.168
I like it. I like it.
Get ready to plate soon.

36:53.212 --> 36:55.086
All right, remember visuals.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.172
First impressions
are so important.

36:57.216 --> 36:59.299
Two minutes left to go.
It's go-time!

36:59.301 --> 37:01.301
Oh, my goodness,
that's gorgeous.

37:01.303 --> 37:04.596
- Make it sexy!
- Ae, that looks good.

37:04.598 --> 37:06.765
- Make sure you get all your
bacon on there, right?
- Yep.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.800
All right, brother,
you good now.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.061
- That's it. Perfect.
- I don't think there's
too much bacon.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.355
- Is there too much bacon?
- It's a bacon challenge.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.357
- Richard: 20 seconds left.
- Oh, yes!

37:15.359 --> 37:17.776
Courtney:
Beautiful, pyet. Beautiful.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.069
A lot of confidence over here.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.153
Dude, that looks good.
Gorgeous.

37:20.197 --> 37:23.531
Eight, seven, six, five,

37:23.533 --> 37:28.203
four, three, two, one.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.163
Hands up for high-fives only.

37:30.207 --> 37:32.582
Great job!
Everything looks amazing.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.417
Richard:
Good job, everyone. Good job.

37:34.461 --> 37:36.127
Whoo!

37:39.049 --> 37:41.007
- Nyesha, gordon, welcome.
- Thank you.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.217
Richard: Successful dishes.

37:42.219 --> 37:44.886
Three outstanding cooks,
I'll tell you what.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.222
Nothing was left
on the cutting board.

37:47.266 --> 37:50.141
All three chefs threw down.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.185
Let's start with
the bacon drunken noodles.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.145
Ae:
<i> What I'm confident about</i>
<i> myself is the flavors.</i>

37:54.189 --> 37:56.064
<i> Okay, flavors I got down.</i>

37:57.234 --> 38:00.068
These taste buds,
they dance every day.

38:00.112 --> 38:03.196
There's a beautiful balance
of sweetness,

38:03.240 --> 38:07.701
but the textural elements
are a little bit clunky, right,
with that bacon.

38:07.744 --> 38:11.079
There's a nice heat
coming through there,
those noodles.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.123
I just think all
of the ingredients on there

38:13.166 --> 38:16.084
and I think about
this minimalistic dish,

38:16.086 --> 38:19.004
is it screaming out
next level?

38:19.006 --> 38:21.548
All right,
let's move on to the bacon
with cavatelli and peas.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.968
<i> My only worry is if my dough</i>
<i> had enough time to rest.</i>

38:25.012 --> 38:26.428
That's my only concern
at this point.

38:28.849 --> 38:32.809
So I'm hoping
that the judges see that
I stepped outside the box.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.103
Just to be clear,
was this homemade?

38:35.105 --> 38:37.063
- Yes, homemade cavatelli.
- Nyesha: Wow.

38:37.107 --> 38:41.067
Gordon, I think it's virtually
impossible to hand make
cavatelli in 30 minutes,

38:41.111 --> 38:43.945
so whoever
put this together is bold.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.656
I think the cavatelli could be
a little bit more relaxed,

38:46.700 --> 38:49.326
and that's in the process
of letting it rest.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.996
It needs to be a touch softer,
but it is good.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.292
Nyesha: Visually,
it looks well balanced
on the sauce to pasta ratio,

38:57.336 --> 39:00.503
but I'm trying to find where
maybe some areas of opportunity

39:00.505 --> 39:01.671
could use
a little bit of spice.

39:01.965 --> 39:05.383
All right, finally we have
the bacon wrapped scallops.

39:06.970 --> 39:10.263
- Nyesha: Wow.
- Gordon: Wow. So there it is.
It's glistening.

39:14.728 --> 39:18.772
Salsa needs something
sort of moist in there
'cause it's very textural.

39:18.774 --> 39:21.274
The bacon is
a little touch crispy.

39:21.276 --> 39:25.153
But whoever cooked
those scallops is cooking
with finesse and precision.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.322
To have the balls
to wrap them in bacon,

39:27.366 --> 39:29.491
that's a fine art right there.

39:29.493 --> 39:33.578
For me, I would love visually
to see more herbs in the salsa,

39:33.580 --> 39:37.874
but an amazing flavor coming off
of the purée.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.626
All right, gordon, nyesha,

39:39.628 --> 39:44.255
which dish was the best dish
of the challenge?

39:45.592 --> 39:49.010
Hands down, the scallops
wrapped in bacon.

39:51.014 --> 39:53.306
Nyesha, which dish
was your favorite?

39:53.308 --> 39:56.559
It's very clear to me these
chefs are cooking with love,

39:56.603 --> 40:00.480
and there's one dish
that's sticking out to me,
and I hope it's pyet's.

40:00.524 --> 40:05.693
My favorite dish is

40:05.737 --> 40:07.112
the bacon wrapped scallop.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.990
Well, that dish
was cooked by pyet.

40:11.034 --> 40:13.618
- Gordon: Wow.
- Congratulations.
You're safe.

40:13.662 --> 40:16.663
Thank you. Ooh, ooh!
Pyet's still here.

40:16.706 --> 40:21.918
Very happy that I will
be staying in this competition
to fight another day.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.170
<i> I have to go down</i>
<i> to the basement,</i>

40:24.214 --> 40:28.258
<i> but if I have to climb</i>
<i> my way up, then so be it.</i>

40:28.301 --> 40:31.886
Gordon and nyesha,
I'm gonna ask you to choose

40:31.930 --> 40:33.555
the weakest dish of the night,

40:33.598 --> 40:36.516
the dish of the person
who's gonna be heading home.

40:38.145 --> 40:42.564
The least favorite dish
for me...

40:42.566 --> 40:43.982
Is the drunken noodles.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.195
The deciding factor between
the drunken noodles

40:49.239 --> 40:52.031
<i> and the cavatelli was</i>
<i> there needs to be more effort.</i>

40:52.033 --> 40:56.661
If I give you a plethora
of incredible ingredients,
then let it shine.

40:58.165 --> 41:01.875
Simply based on the idea
of elevating ingredients,

41:01.877 --> 41:05.795
I'm gonna have to as well
go with the drunken noodle
as my least favorite dish.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.174
Unfortunately,
that dish was made by ae.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.970
I'm so proud of what you did,
not just tonight,

41:14.014 --> 41:15.346
not just in
the last elimination,

41:15.348 --> 41:16.931
but during
this whole competition.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.142
Your spirit is genuine
and amazing.

41:19.186 --> 41:21.561
- Your food is delicious.
- Thank you.

41:21.563 --> 41:24.522
I joined this competition
to share my lao culture

41:24.566 --> 41:29.068
and food to the world,
and even our attitude.

41:29.070 --> 41:33.281
Trust me, a lot of lao girls
are feisty, for sure.

41:33.325 --> 41:36.326
Ae, unfortunately,
you will not be
the next level chef.

41:36.328 --> 41:39.704
- Say goodbye to your friends.
- Bye, sweetie.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.122
- I'm so proud of you.
- I'll see you soon.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.582
Chef blais, I adore you.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.250
<i> I'll see you in san diego</i>
<i> for sure.</i>

41:44.294 --> 41:45.877
And I go to your restaurants
all the time,

41:45.921 --> 41:47.879
so hopefully one day
you come say hi to me.

41:47.923 --> 41:49.130
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.840
- Gordon: Bye, ae.
- Bye.

41:50.884 --> 41:52.175
Ae: Thank you.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.304
( groans )

41:56.348 --> 41:58.306
now, a warning for everyone.

41:58.350 --> 42:03.019
I hope that you
will all continue to rise up

42:03.104 --> 42:06.898
because your next challenge

42:06.900 --> 42:08.399
is gonna be twice as hard.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.984
- Oh, gosh.
- Good night.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.070
- All: Good night.
- Thank you.

42:12.113 --> 42:14.739
- Good night, chefs.
- Pyet can sneak up on you.

42:14.783 --> 42:17.992
I really wish she went home,
but I'm gonna keep
my eye on her.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.079
Kenny, pyet, well done.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.830
- Yes, chef.
- Thank you, chef.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.040
The goal is to be
on the top floor,

42:24.084 --> 42:25.917
not competing
in an elimination challenge,

42:25.961 --> 42:27.293
<i> and I don't plan on</i>
<i> going back.</i>

42:27.337 --> 42:29.963
- Day one, baby.
- From the bottom to the top.

42:29.965 --> 42:33.383
- Let's go.
- What's twice as hard?

42:36.638 --> 42:38.596
Gordon:<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:38.598 --> 42:42.183
Richard:
Your job is to grab ingredients
from two different countries

42:42.227 --> 42:44.519
and create
an amazing fusion dish.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.354
I am not ready
for today's challenge.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.856
Mariah: Reuel seems like
he's questioning his dish.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.651
I have never felt so lost.

42:51.736 --> 42:55.113
I'm not confident in putting
together a cohesive dish.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.949
- This is not
next level cooking.
- Yes, chef.

42:57.993 --> 42:59.909
Richard:
I think this is the toughest
challenge we've had so far.

42:59.953 --> 43:01.369
Please taste good.
Please taste good.

43:01.413 --> 43:02.829
( coughs )

43:02.831 --> 43:03.830
you're sandbagging me here.

43:03.832 --> 43:04.956
( bleep )

43:05.000 --> 43:06.708
really? This is ( bleep ).
