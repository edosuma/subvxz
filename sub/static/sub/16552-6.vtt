00:06.006 --> 00:07.633
<i>All right, Wiggleworms.</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:08.926
<i>You guys ready?</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.802
Are you ready to sing?

00:10.886 --> 00:13.972
Okay, who wants to go
on a bus ride?

00:14.056 --> 00:16.808
You guys know this one, right?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.157
What do the people do?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.798
Hey, guys.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.424
-Hi!
-Aw, that was fun.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.343
-Yeah.
-Love having you guys here.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.553
-Thanks for being here.
-Is it weird that I'm the only dude here?

00:53.637 --> 00:54.721
- Yes, it's... A little.
- No, no.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.098
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's nice.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.432
I have a lunch break right now.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.850
I don't know
if you guys have plans. Do you--

00:58.934 --> 01:00.352
-You go.
-We have to--

01:00.435 --> 01:01.478
-You go.
-Are you sure?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.398
Yeah, for sure.
I... I'll put her down, feed her.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.025
I have a client in two hours.
Can you be back in two hours?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.735
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Catch up? I mean, I don't even...

01:08.819 --> 01:11.196
I have to be back in an hour,
so it won't even be that...

01:11.280 --> 01:12.531
I love you.
Thank you, honey.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.824
-Oh, good... good...
-Bye.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.950
- Nice to see you.
- ...to see you.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.702
What did Old MacDonald have?

01:16.785 --> 01:17.869
-Oh, a farm.
-Yeah, right.

01:17.953 --> 01:18.996
And a... a dog.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.747
-Need to get that out of my head.
-Get out of here, dork.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.124
All right, good seeing you.
See you next week.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.458
- Love you.
- Love you, baby.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.710
-I'm just gonna grab my jacket.
-Yes.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.962
-All right, awesome. Cool.
-Let's do it.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.053
<i>This is so awesome.</i>

01:35.137 --> 01:36.722
-Crazy, right?
-Crazy.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.807
-Yeah.
-It looks so different.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.517
Gutted, gone.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.852
And this whole wall
is gonna go away,

01:41.935 --> 01:43.854
and behind this wall
is 4,000 square feet

01:43.937 --> 01:47.107
where we're going to have the restaurant,
and bar and concession stand,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.109
so you can actually bring
your cocktails into the theater.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.819
-That's so awesome.
-Yep.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.155
Didn't we see, like,
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding</i> in this one?

01:53.238 --> 01:55.115
- You remember that?
- Yeah!

01:55.198 --> 01:57.492
- That was a good night.
- Hello!

01:58.910 --> 02:00.871
That was really sweet of Tom
to take the baby.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.414
I know. He's a sweetheart.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.626
He's really been giving me some...
some mama time, which is great.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.752
-It's inspiring.
-Mmm-hmm.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.880
I see you guys and I'm like, "Yeah,
that is like something that I would want."

02:09.963 --> 02:13.467
-You know? It's really nice.
-Well, what about you? Any...

02:14.301 --> 02:16.553
prospects?
Anybody on the horizon?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.430
Um, well, no. Not really.

02:18.513 --> 02:22.893
I've been on four first dates,
um, but I'm on... Because I'm on this app.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.895
-Really?
-Yeah, I did it. I finally did it.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.146
- Really?
- Yep. Do you wanna see it?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.397
-Yes.
-It's like a game.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.565
You can just play it.
You can pick--

02:28.649 --> 02:30.067
-Oh, my God.
-You wanna pick guys with me right now?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.401
I've been so curious about this.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.736
-It's awesome.
-Everyone's talking about this--

02:32.819 --> 02:34.988
I know. You just can,
like, pick through these guys.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.782
-So, there are--
-What do you mean, you just pick...

02:36.865 --> 02:37.908
-What do you mean--
-There's thousands.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.743
There's thousands of guys
and you just...

02:39.826 --> 02:41.745
swipe left,
or right if you like them,

02:41.828 --> 02:43.997
and then if I like them
and then they like me...

02:44.081 --> 02:45.874
They see my profile
and they like me,

02:45.957 --> 02:48.627
then... then we match,
and then we can start talking.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.629
Um, like, you text each other, kind of.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.838
So far, I went on four dates.

02:51.922 --> 02:55.550
And two were bar dates, like, a drink,
and then two were coffee dates.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.677
And how did they go?

02:57.761 --> 03:00.055
The two bar dates...
Oh, then I slept with them.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.182
- The two coffee-- I know.
- Oh!

03:02.265 --> 03:04.643
That's the difference
between coffee and... and a vodka.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.103
Nice.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.814
Remember your core.
Deep breath.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.440
Okay, good.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.608
<i>-What is it, exactly? You buy--</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

03:11.691 --> 03:13.944
-Do you have to buy it? You, what--
-The app? No, it's free.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.195
-Download it.
-Oh, it's a free app?

03:15.278 --> 03:18.073
Yeah, it takes like two seconds.
It, like, uploads from your Facebook.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.075
So how many dates
are you going on with this thing?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.701
Um, just whenever I feel like it.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.496
It's usually, like, you know,
two or three days a week.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.289
- No way.
- Yeah, it's great.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.666
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not kidding.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.751
-Okay. Head forward. Down. Chin drop.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.170
Hey, that's a whole new...
whole new world out there, huh?

03:32.254 --> 03:34.589
- It's a brave new world.
- Exact-- Exactly.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.174
The possibilities are, like...

03:36.258 --> 03:39.386
-endless.
-Endless. Yeah. Imagine. Yeah.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.347
-There's, like, guys all over the place.
-Uh--

03:42.431 --> 03:45.475
Like, within a three-minute radius of her.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.602
-Babe--
-And she's getting it three times a week.

03:47.686 --> 03:51.064
- Oh, my--
- And she's cute, really cute. But, like...

03:51.148 --> 03:52.733
-You won't even believe this.
-What?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.860
I just had this conversation
with Annie today.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.945
-No.
-Yeah, she's on Tinder.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.824
I'm so in love with you and I'm so in love
with the way that we met, but like...

04:00.907 --> 04:02.743
where was Tinder when we were dating?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.202
I know, right?

04:04.286 --> 04:06.455
What the hell? I can't believe
we missed out on all of that.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.956
-I know.
-Not even a whiff of it.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.416
-I know.
-Nothing.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.878
It was interesting to sit there with Annie
and kind of swipe through people,

04:12.961 --> 04:15.088
and, you know, you can,
like, chat with them in the moment.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.381
Right.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.425
Like, it's...
it's a little bit nerve-racking

04:18.508 --> 04:20.260
and a little bit exciting and...

04:20.343 --> 04:21.803
-Hmm...
-Yeah, I mean--

04:21.887 --> 04:23.180
Were you getting
a little kick out of that?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.390
I was... Yeah, I was.
I was getting a little kick out of it.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.642
-Wow. I like it.
-I think it, you know,

04:27.726 --> 04:29.269
could be something that...

04:30.270 --> 04:33.398
might be fun to try ourselves.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.524
Fun?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.110
Don't you think it would be kind of...

04:38.028 --> 04:40.363
exciting to maybe...

04:40.447 --> 04:43.033
I don't know,
maybe put up a profile, and...

04:43.992 --> 04:47.245
see if we can... reel one in?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.043
-See if we still got it.
-Are you kidding me? Reel one in?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.378
What are you talking about?
You're crazy.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.340
You wanna what?
You wanna what...

05:00.342 --> 05:03.136
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.596
Brain explode.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.889
Are you crazy?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.265
-Are you serious right now?
-I'm serious.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.351
You want to set up a Tinder account to...
For what purpose?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.937
What, so we're, like, okay,
sexy couple who is...

05:12.020 --> 05:13.647
Seeking another woman.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.235
My love.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.197
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me see that one.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.241
-Oh, no.
-No.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.659
-All right.
-No, babe. No, no, no. Okay, wait.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.619
-Gone. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
-All right.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.037
Do... do, like, a... Okay--

05:29.120 --> 05:31.081
-What do you want? Sexy kind of--
-Let's... let's do, like, a--

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
Yeah, like, more just, like, inviting.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.709
-All right, inviting.
-Inviting.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.673
Wait a second.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.300
Oh, I think that's nice.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.678
I feel like it's just a little bit...

05:44.761 --> 05:47.097
-Okay. Okay.
-A bit conservative.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.349
I mean, sitting at the...
That's better.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.725
I think we should change the location.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.811
I don't...
I think we should do the basement.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.437
-The basement?
-Yeah.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.606
That is a total panty-dropper.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.858
- Exactly.
- Oh, my God!

06:01.611 --> 06:03.780
- Pretend like you're having a drink.
- Right.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.032
-I'm just casually having a drink.
-Like, we're, like, loose, cool.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.826
-Okay, get it ready.
-Okay. Here we go, okay?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.911
Is this too, like, '70s porn star?

06:09.995 --> 06:12.581
Um, it's totally '70s porn star,

06:12.664 --> 06:14.499
-but then, we are in the basement.
-Is that what we want?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.751
Don't do this.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.253
-What are we doing?
-I mean--

06:18.336 --> 06:19.379
Here, let me see.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.756
-Mmm... no.
-No.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.467
Definitely not.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.220
Have you imagined?
I wonder what, uh...

06:28.138 --> 06:30.974
-Mmm.
-...it would be like

06:31.057 --> 06:33.059
having that in bed with us.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.400
Okay, honey. Oh, come on.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.736
We just need
a little... a little lappy, lappy.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.071
She's so fussy today, babe.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.865
-Yeah, she just--
-I mean, is there anything going on...

06:46.948 --> 06:48.533
By the way,
what is happening over there?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.327
Uh... Mmm-mmm.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.162
-You want it, bubba? Here you go, baby.
-Not yet.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.497
-Oh, yeah? Okay.
-Some really interesting ones, though.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.915
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.294
Well, you better call me later
if anything exciting comes along.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.879
-Oh, I'll call you, baby. Don't you worry.
-I'm like--

07:00.962 --> 07:03.256
- Mmm-hmm. That's good. That's a good baby.
<i>- One, two...</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:04.799
-Look at that.
<i>-...three, four...</i>

07:14.643 --> 07:16.853
Yes! Nice job!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.188
Hey, Angela.
How's it going?

07:18.313 --> 07:21.232
-Hey, good, Annie. How about you?
-Good, thanks.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.179
<i>Here we have it.</i>

07:51.262 --> 07:53.473
The main attraction.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.226
It used to be
an old vaudeville house in 1916.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.438
And, uh, in the '50s, they converted it
into two theaters and dropped the ceiling.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.233
So it's the first time we've seen
the original architecture since then.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.359
Since the '50s.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.653
And we're going to recreate
the vaudeville stage

08:06.736 --> 08:08.655
right up in front here.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.865
How many seats
will this auditorium hold?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.367
-Three hundred and ten.
-Really?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.119
-It's a good size.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.870
Feel free to look around and...

08:15.954 --> 08:17.914
...we have the plans
up on the wall here.

08:33.555 --> 08:36.099
- Okay.
<i>- Have you got that?</i>

08:36.182 --> 08:37.308
I want ten each side.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.643
-All right.
-I'll be right back.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.020
All right.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.274
<i>This isn't like...</i>

08:44.357 --> 08:46.067
let's walk Tom down a dark alley

08:46.151 --> 08:48.194
and see what, like...
This isn't a trap. This is like--

08:48.278 --> 08:49.571
-No!
-'Cause I love you.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.948
You know I love you
and, like, I don't need anything else.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.034
I'm so happy and--

08:54.117 --> 08:57.037
I love you, too.
It's not like that at all.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.583
I don't know. I just think
that it might be kind of fun,

09:02.250 --> 09:03.877
- and that because--
- Post-baby spice.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.587
Post-baby spice.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.297
I think we can do it...

09:07.380 --> 09:09.257
-Uh-huh.
-...because we're solid.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.092
-You know?
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.721
- Yeah. Yes. Yes.
- Right?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.222
Yes.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.640
-Okay.
-So solid.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.100
-So, what do we--
-Wait. So what do we--

09:19.184 --> 09:20.393
-What?
-So she swiped?

09:20.477 --> 09:21.770
-He, what... How does this--
-No. Okay, so...

09:21.853 --> 09:23.730
-What happened? Are you--
-Okay, she basically just said,

09:23.813 --> 09:24.898
"Is it... is it legit,

09:24.981 --> 09:27.067
-or is it a social experiment?"
-Mmm-hmm.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.944
-And I just kind of went...
-What did you say?

09:30.028 --> 09:32.489
..."A little bit of both,
question mark, question mark."

09:32.572 --> 09:34.741
-Nice.
-And then she...

09:34.824 --> 09:37.702
just sent some emoji.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.454
-Uh, saying--
-Yeah, what was the emoji?

09:39.537 --> 09:40.622
Two girls and a guy.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.415
- Yeah.
- No.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.877
And, uh, I just kind of did a thumbs-up.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.880
So, I don't really know if it's...

09:48.963 --> 09:50.215
You know...

09:50.298 --> 09:51.883
I think she's game.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.135
I just don't want to be the dumbass

09:54.219 --> 09:57.889
-who is, like, you know--
-But, you know, I mean--

09:57.972 --> 09:59.766
I know. I know, and...

09:59.849 --> 10:01.434
Like, is... is she...

10:02.477 --> 10:03.686
-She's--
-I mean...

10:03.770 --> 10:06.272
I mean, she's great at singing
"Wheels on the Bus."

10:06.356 --> 10:09.109
I mean, is she...

10:09.192 --> 10:10.652
Do you think she's, um...

10:10.735 --> 10:12.779
-She's a little crazy. Yeah.
-She is? Okay.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.240
She's a little... little...
Like, the good crazy.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.910
-I think she'd be kind of perfect.
-Yeah?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.996
- Okay, pros and cons.
- Right, pros and cons.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.040
-Pros is we know her...
-Mmm-hmm.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.292
...we know where she's been,
what she's been doing.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.086
-Right. Good.
-Yeah.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.712
-That's--
-We know that she's safe.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.382
-Yeah.
-So, like, it's a good place to land.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.719
-Cons... we know her.
-Mmm.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.764
-She, like, is singing to our baby.
-We're gonna see her. To our child.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.768
But I think that she's just--

10:43.852 --> 10:46.229
I mean, we're not gonna have to
quit music class? I love that class.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.730
No, no, no, no, no.
You can still go.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.440
-She's like--
-You might look at her in a different way.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.568
It's like X-ray vision.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.697
Her boobs are gonna look
really different to you, so...

10:55.780 --> 10:57.240
But I just...

10:57.323 --> 10:59.159
I just think that if...

10:59.242 --> 11:01.411
-if anything, if anyone--
-Yeah.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.830
I think if we just talked to her,

11:03.913 --> 11:06.708
kind of set some boundaries,
see how she's really feeling about it,

11:06.791 --> 11:09.711
and, you know, we'll...
we'll figure out

11:09.794 --> 11:11.629
-how we're going to do this.
-I love you.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.089
I love you, too.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.678
<i>Green?</i>

11:18.761 --> 11:20.179
I don't know.
It's not my favorite.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.848
-Bit drab?
-Uh, yeah.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.225
- Yeah, I get it.
- You've got better.

11:24.309 --> 11:28.021
Okay, we've got a...
blue, Western, cowboy thing?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.480
-Mmm, I like that one, yeah.
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah?

11:29.564 --> 11:30.982
-Okay, great.
-I really like that one.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.567
Is this what it's like
to be single today?

11:32.650 --> 11:33.943
- God, I don't know.
- I mean--

11:34.027 --> 11:36.029
-It's been so long, I totally forgot.
-Green shirt? Blue shirt?

11:36.112 --> 11:37.196
It's stressful.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.656
Okay, so there's milk in the fridge
if she wakes up.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.033
-Just an ounce. Just a little bit.
-Okay.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.367
-You can warm it up, and, uh--
-Yeah, yeah.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.620
You've got our cell phones, right?
We've both got our cell phones.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.121
-Yeah, got both your numbers.
-Text, call, anything.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.456
-They'll be on the table.
-Got it all, guys.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.874
Really. You look really nice.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.959
Are you guys, uh...
Is it a date night? Or...

11:50.877 --> 11:52.128
Yeah.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.256
Okay. Well, have fun, you know.
I've got it covered.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.549
- Okay, thank you.
- Excellent.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.884
-You're the best.
-See you later.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.472
-Hi, there. How are you?
-Oh, good. Thanks.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.681
Can I get you something to drink?

12:03.765 --> 12:05.767
Yeah, I'm gonna have
the, uh... the fish one.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.560
"Some days last a long time."

12:07.644 --> 12:09.646
-Excellent. Be right back.
-Thanks.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.522
<i>- It's gonna be fine. Easy.</i>
<i>- Let's just do it.</i>

12:11.606 --> 12:13.066
If she's not into it,
or you're not into it...

12:13.149 --> 12:14.400
If we're not into it,
we'll just have a cocktail.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.985
If we decide we don't want to do it,
it doesn't matter.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.196
She'll be totally cool about it.
Okay, let's go.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.866
-Hi!
-Hi. How are you?

12:21.950 --> 12:24.702
-I'm good. How are you? Oh.
-I'm good. Um...

12:24.786 --> 12:26.454
- Hey, hi. Hey, sorry. How are you?
- Hi.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.331
-There's a table right over here.
-Let me get the other one.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.333
I'm gonna grab it
before anyone else grabs it, okay?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.626
-Here. Hand?
-Oh, great. I'm gonna get my stuff.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.044
-Okay. Is this yours?
-Oh, yeah.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.796
-Have a sip. It's really good. Yeah.
-Yeah?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.506
-Let's broach the elephant in the room.
-Right? Right?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.465
Let's just talk about it.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.509
- Okay. Like, rip the Band-Aid off.
- Right.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.844
Okay. You're... We're...

12:41.928 --> 12:43.388
And we want to make sure
we're on the same page.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.555
That's... that's how I feel.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.640
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.184
-About what's... Why we're here.
-So we're open.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.396
We are, like... We basically love
each other completely.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.855
-Mmm-hmm.
-Safe space.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.734
- And, um...
- We just wanted to...

12:56.818 --> 12:58.820
I mean,
we were curious and excited,

12:58.903 --> 13:00.905
and when I...
when I went through your Tinder,

13:00.989 --> 13:04.075
I just thought, "God, this is something
that we kind of missed out on,"

13:04.158 --> 13:06.327
and at the same time,
not that I'm sad that we missed out--

13:06.411 --> 13:08.997
-No. No, we didn't miss out on anything.
-It's just kind of a curious thing

13:09.080 --> 13:10.498
-to be able to do together.
-We just feel like it was

13:10.581 --> 13:12.792
an interesting thing to explore
because we'd never tried it before.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.127
-Yes.
-And then--

13:14.210 --> 13:15.670
- So, you've never done this before?
- No.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.046
-Not... I mean, we've--
-Well, not on Tinder.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.339
-Well, we had a thing...
-Had one thing.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.507
-...but it was a long time ago.
-Oh, that time.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.634
- You told me about that.
- We were wasted. We were drunk.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.302
-We were so drunk.
-That was a long time ago, right?

13:23.386 --> 13:25.096
-Loads of tequila. Yeah.
-We didn't know the girl.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.389
- Okay.
- This is... I mean--

13:26.472 --> 13:28.433
Well, that's the thing. I mean,
because I do know you. I mean--

13:28.516 --> 13:30.560
- Subsequently nothing.
- We've known each other for so long.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.353
I don't want to ruin...
I don't want to be in the way.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.272
-No, no. No.
-Absolutely.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.024
-Listen--
-We don't want you to be in... No.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.943
-This is about giving, loving, sharing.
-We want it to be safe.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.903
- It's a safe space.
- Comfortable.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.030
-Super comfy.
-Yeah.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.074
-Cozy. It's cozy and it's easy.
-And above all, friendship is first.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.911
- Friendship. And family.
- Listen, this is, for us...

13:48.995 --> 13:50.288
Friendship and family.
And this is why

13:50.371 --> 13:52.331
-we love that you are here.
-Which we are... here.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.875
-Because--
-So, we're all on the same page.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.251
We want to do this.
We want to do this?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.502
- Yeah! Let's do it.
- Right?

13:56.586 --> 13:57.920
-Okay, I should tell you...
-You only live once.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.130
...I have never done this.
This is a...

13:59.213 --> 14:00.256
- Okay.
- Right.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.717
It's something I've thought about,
I've wanted to do.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.010
You know, and then
I see you guys and I'm like...

14:04.093 --> 14:06.137
That's why I texted you.
I'm like, "What? Is this, like, real?"

14:06.220 --> 14:07.805
-Great.
-So, yeah. So, okay.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.433
- So this is all... We're doing it.
- So, we're good?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.226
- We're doing it.
- Okay

14:14.812 --> 14:16.522
I don't want her
to see you, so just...

14:16.606 --> 14:19.108
We'll sneak down
to the basement, okay?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.651
- Okay, got it.
- But what if she--

14:20.735 --> 14:22.695
If she sees me,
I'll just say I forgot--

14:22.779 --> 14:24.447
No, just don't say anything.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.367
- Don't let her see you.
- Just go that way. Just go that way.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.161
- Hi, Hazel.
- Hey.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.412
Hi, Hazel!

14:32.413 --> 14:33.664
- How are ya? How was she?
- Good.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.792
- Good. Uh, she was all right.
- Great.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.878
She, uh, was a little fussy.
She woke up a few times.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.171
She was up a few times?

14:43.341 --> 14:44.675
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

14:44.759 --> 14:48.096
- Okay.
- Um... Drinks.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.847
Yeah, that sounds good.
That sounds lovely.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.265
Just let me know
when you need me next.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.392
-Yeah, will do.
-All right.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.477
-Sorry, we were a little bit later.
-Oh, no. It's not a problem.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.561
-I'll see you guys soon.
-All right.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.355
-Have a good night.
-Bye, love. Bye. Thank you.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.277
<i>It's warm, but whatever.</i>

15:03.361 --> 15:05.154
-Who cares. We're a little drunk.
-Honey, I just got to say

15:05.238 --> 15:07.782
I fucking love you.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.534
This is amazing.
This is gonna be great.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.285
Okay, guys.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.995
Hazel has left the building.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.455
Oh, good.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.541
And Betsy is asleep.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.084
Amazing.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.919
-All right.
-Baby, what do you want to drink?

15:20.002 --> 15:22.088
Um... I'll take a tequila, I guess.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.256
-Tequila.
-I want to cheers.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.466
I'm waiting to cheers.
I want to cheers with you guys.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.760
- Why spoil the habit of a lifetime?
- I know, right?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.053
Ice.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.389
- I'm gonna go put some tunes on.
- Okay, yeah. Good idea. Tunes.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.974
- What are we in the mood for?
- Cheers!

15:33.057 --> 15:34.350
What are we in the mood for?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.768
- This is a nice night.
- I got one.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.564
This is fun.
This is really nice.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.940
Yeah. Really nice evening.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.608
No. No, that was...

15:42.692 --> 15:44.527
-Yeah. Super. Yeah.
-Let's dance. You wanna dance?

15:44.610 --> 15:47.405
- Oh, yeah. That's nice. Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.615
You seem to be into it, baby.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.909
- She's so good at this.
- No, yeah.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.517
-Okay, all right.
-I'm just so happy.

16:16.601 --> 16:17.810
It was, you know...

16:17.894 --> 16:18.936
Let's just get comfy and cozy.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.438
-Take it step by step.
-Okay, okay.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.064
- How about you just, uh...
- Oh, yeah.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.983
-Oh, I have my shoes on.
-Okay.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.693
- Let's do that.
- Oh, okay.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.904
Okay.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.238
That's it.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.616
Hi.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.534
Let me see you kiss her again.

16:34.869 --> 16:35.995
Okay.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.344
Will you do the honors?

16:51.427 --> 16:52.845
My pleasure, darling.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.244
Oh, here he comes.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.329
Here he comes.

17:27.922 --> 17:31.050
- Oh, shit.
- Wait a second.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.053
Maybe she's...
She'll go back...

17:34.136 --> 17:35.638
She'll drop back asleep.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.682
Maybe she's gonna
drop back to sleep.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.102
- No.
- I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.228
You'll go?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.105
- You guys...
- Okay.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.273
...just keep going.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.399
I'll just...

17:46.482 --> 17:47.984
- Have you got milk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.194
- Do you need anything?
- No. Just stay. I'll be right back.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.862
Okay, okay.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.447
Uh...

18:04.542 --> 18:05.585
<i>We... we shouldn't...</i>

18:05.668 --> 18:07.628
We should wait, right?
We should...

18:07.712 --> 18:09.755
We... we should wait
for Lucy to come back.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.508
-Yeah. We should wait.
-Yeah, okay.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.720
You're very...
you're very handsome.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.887
You're very beautiful.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.055
You're really handsome.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.473
- You're so...
- No, you're really beautiful.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.309

18:59.972 --> 19:01.432
- Hi, baby.
- Wait, what are you doing?

19:01.515 --> 19:03.309
Well, she's got, like,
a lower back pain, so I thought--

19:03.392 --> 19:04.644
-Yeah, my back's hurting.
-What?

19:04.727 --> 19:06.020
She can go to a chiropractor.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.355
Yeah, right.
Yeah, but--

19:07.438 --> 19:08.773
We're just--

19:08.856 --> 19:10.066

-Oh, we missed you.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.319
- Hi.
- Good position.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.828
You're so beautiful.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.755
Jesus, baby.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.881
Oh, hey.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.554
I'm gonna take this off, baby.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.287

21:30.456 --> 21:32.583
What have you two
been doing without me?

21:32.666 --> 21:33.876
We've been waiting for you.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.045
Oh, yeah?

22:03.906 --> 22:05.407

Is that cool?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.656

-I love her, too.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.324
I really love her.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.743
Not as much as I love you.

22:49.827 --> 22:50.953

24:16.955 --> 24:18.957
This is gonna be
the best sleep of our lives.
