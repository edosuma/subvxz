WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:04.200
Welcome, everyone.
I'm Dr. Debra Radcliffe.

00:04.205 --> 00:07.165
And today I'm going to help you
clean out your junk drawer.

00:07.374 --> 00:10.339
Of course, I'm talking about
an emotional junk drawer

00:10.344 --> 00:15.111
where we store all the pain,
fear, anger that shapes us.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.113
Who would like
to share why they're here?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.787
This one didn't have her glasses
at the high-school auction.

00:19.828 --> 00:21.817
Thought she was bidding on
a home organizer.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.057
And what a lucky mistake.

00:23.098 --> 00:25.354
In Colombia, we never get to do
things like this.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.456
The only time
that I ever went to a seminar

00:27.461 --> 00:29.658
was how to escape the trunk of a car

00:29.663 --> 00:31.799
when your hands are tied
behind your back.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.667
All right, everybody. On your feet.

00:33.708 --> 00:35.464
Okay. You know, I-I sort of thought

00:35.469 --> 00:38.499
this was a "sit here and listen"
kind of a thing. Yeah.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.403
Or as I call it, marriage.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.004
Where's my husbands at?

00:42.009 --> 00:44.974
It's good to laugh at what
makes us most uncomfortable.

00:44.979 --> 00:48.077
But the next three hours will
require active participation.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.517
Let's clear a little space
for ourselves.

00:49.558 --> 00:51.347
You said this was a 45-minute talk.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.581
So what? I was wrong.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.583
What, is there a place
that you'd rather be

00:54.588 --> 00:56.357
than connecting with your family?

00:56.398 --> 00:58.987
You're really asking this
question on football Sunday?

00:58.993 --> 01:01.929
All these men here gave up
their football today.

01:01.970 --> 01:03.597
Thank you, Mitchell, for your sacrifice.

01:03.638 --> 01:05.594
Hey, you know what? I'm missing
a farmer's market to be here,

01:05.599 --> 01:07.868
so...Yeah, I just made it gayer.

01:07.909 --> 01:09.265
It's perfectly normal

01:09.270 --> 01:12.168
to resist opening your
emotional junk drawer. Mm.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.342
I address that in chapter one --
"hey, get a handle on it".

01:15.383 --> 01:17.940
Why don't we start with a fun
activity to loosen everyone up?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.543
I don't care how loose we get,
I'm not spilling my guts

01:20.548 --> 01:22.545
to some table lamp
pretending it's my mother.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.180
And I won't ask you to, Jay.

01:24.185 --> 01:27.015
That kind of silliness
gives therapy a bad name.

01:27.021 --> 01:30.686
We are going to play a game
called tiger, rock star, bunny.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.720
I got this.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.022
Uh, marry the tiger, kill the bunny --

01:33.027 --> 01:34.287
mnh-mnh. That's not my game.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.092
When I call out tiger,

01:36.097 --> 01:39.195
you will  become a ferocious tiger.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.768
When I call out rock star,

01:40.809 --> 01:43.698
you will be... A major rocker.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.773
And when I call
out bunny, you will be --

01:45.814 --> 01:47.069
halfway home. Goodbye.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.943
Oh, yeah, go ahead, but don't forget

01:48.984 --> 01:50.411
that we don't have a prenup.

01:50.452 --> 01:51.307
Let's get started.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.112
Tiger!

01:54.381 --> 01:56.946
Feel ridiculous.
I might need booze for this.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.247
Oh, me likey that idea.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.820
We are not cut out for this.

01:59.861 --> 02:01.550
You can't compare yourself to me.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.052
I was in "cats".

02:03.057 --> 02:04.954
No one's comparing themselves
to you, cam.

02:04.959 --> 02:05.659
Rock star.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.624
Looking good, Phil.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.396
I won an air-guitar contest
in high school.

02:10.437 --> 02:12.294
Bet that got you
a lot of air girlfriends.

02:12.299 --> 02:17.138
Come on, Jay. Loosen up. It's fun.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.498
What the hell is that, dad?

02:18.506 --> 02:19.666
Playing an accordion.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.841
Supposed to be a rock star.

02:20.882 --> 02:22.171
I think you should do, like,
a guitar or something.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.936
I only know how to play the accordion.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.513
Pick on Mitchell. He's playing a flute.

02:25.554 --> 02:26.753
At least I hope he is.

# Modern Family 7x08 #
Clean Out Your Junk Drawer
Original Air Date on December 2, 2015

02:41.261 --> 02:43.430
So, why did they need you
out of the house?

02:43.471 --> 02:44.760
They said it was some sort of therapy,

02:44.765 --> 02:46.825
but part of me thinks
it's an intervention for mom.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.269
So, how's school?

02:48.310 --> 02:50.166
Well, in my newtonian mechanics class,

02:50.171 --> 02:51.600
we're learning how to calculate

02:51.605 --> 02:53.505
the velocity of free falling
objects in a...

02:55.042 --> 02:56.377
School's hard.

02:56.418 --> 02:58.974
So, anyways, um...

02:58.979 --> 03:01.277
I sort of did something
and I need your advice,

03:01.282 --> 03:05.047
but I don't want a lot of judgment
and criticism. And you came to me?

03:05.052 --> 03:08.651
Yeah, you've always had such a
strong sense of what's right and wrong.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.616
You always know what --
I have a high-school boy toy.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.959
What?! Who?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.689
It's Luke's dorky friend Reuben.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.791
Ugh. I feel so ashamed.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.856
Oh, my God. You should be.
Isn't he, like, 8?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.795
No, he's 16 and 3/4,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.068
and he has to shave
almost every two weeks.

03:21.109 --> 03:23.298
How did you let this happen?
You go to Caltech.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.239
You're surrounded
by age-appropriate dorks.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.504
I know, but I was home
and still feeling sad

03:28.509 --> 03:30.005
about Sanjay breaking up with me,

03:30.010 --> 03:31.478
and it's overwhelming here.

03:31.519 --> 03:33.408
There are so many brilliant people,

03:33.414 --> 03:36.217
and...Reuben idolizes me.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.713
I guess I just kind of needed that,

03:37.718 --> 03:40.048
so I let him kiss me... Oh.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.554
...and a little bit of this.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.992
I'm so weak.
I can't imagine anything worse.

03:45.033 --> 03:46.327
I hooked up with Andy.

03:46.368 --> 03:47.323
What?! Mm-hmm.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.325
Engaged Andy? I know.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.326
We were all alone at this house

03:50.331 --> 03:51.860
that dad had set up to be sexy --

03:51.865 --> 03:53.325
dad made it sexy for you?!

03:53.334 --> 03:56.670
No, no, for the buyer,
but Andy and I were alone,

03:56.711 --> 03:59.200
a-and suddenly...Bam.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.566
Bam? Mm-hmm.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.909
"Bam" as in sex

04:01.950 --> 04:04.278
or "bam" as in what Reuben
shouted when he unhooked my bra?

04:04.319 --> 04:06.347
Let's just leave it at "bam".

04:06.388 --> 04:08.344
Look at us.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.249
I don't even know
what to feel right now.

04:10.251 --> 04:13.416
Shame, guilt, fear.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.389
These are just some of the things

04:15.430 --> 04:18.719
we shoved in the back of our
junk drawers when we were young.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.156
This exercise comes
from chapter three --

04:21.161 --> 04:23.559
"scary dreams, expired creams".

04:23.564 --> 04:25.561
Oh, I have both of those.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.796
This may seem unconventional,

04:27.802 --> 04:30.237
but it helps access painful memories...

04:30.278 --> 04:31.997
This is nice.
...While allowing your partner

04:32.006 --> 04:33.903
to see the vulnerable child you
once were. No, it's not. It's weird.

04:33.908 --> 04:35.977
You're so tense today, my little baby.

04:36.018 --> 04:37.573
What are you worried about?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.447
Us looking like idiots.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.844
What? We're superstars here.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.246
Married the longest,
three happy children,

04:44.251 --> 04:45.781
one with a bright future.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.184
You're right.

04:48.189 --> 04:49.919
We're gonna win this thing.

04:49.924 --> 04:51.258
It's not a competition.

04:51.299 --> 04:53.756
Exactly. We have this in the bag.

04:53.761 --> 04:54.957
Mitchell and cam fall apart

04:54.962 --> 04:56.430
if they've got to pick a restaurant,

04:56.471 --> 04:58.828
and all Gloria ever does
is yell at my dad.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.768
Shh.

05:00.809 --> 05:03.598
Yeah, I'd really hate
to be your dad right now.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.507
Now, tell me everything
that you're thinking.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.767
I'm thinking about all that
other stuff we could've bid on

05:08.776 --> 05:10.506
at that auction
instead of this nonsense.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.848
Lunch with Larry king.
A ride along in a cop car.

05:13.889 --> 05:15.408
I heard they let you tase someone.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.846
Jay, this is important.

05:16.851 --> 05:19.248
Dr. Debra said that this is good for us.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.288
Now close your eyes.

05:20.329 --> 05:21.684
Why should I close my eyes?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.358
Because I don't like you looking
up at my neck like that.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.627
The other day,
I took a selfie from down there

05:26.668 --> 05:29.292
and I thought that I was face
timing with my grandmother.

05:29.297 --> 05:31.557
I wemember my mom went into the store

05:31.565 --> 05:33.795
and left me all alone
in the back of a twuck.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.369
Okay, do you have to do the baby talk?

05:35.410 --> 05:37.199
I couldn't pronounce
my r's when I was younger

05:37.204 --> 05:39.073
and the other children
made fun of me, Mitchell. Okay.

05:39.114 --> 05:40.708
It was very twaumatic.

05:40.749 --> 05:42.938
Mom? Mommy? Where are you?

05:42.944 --> 05:44.540
All right, I'm --
I'm starting to lose feeling.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.574
Oh, am I squishing your legs?

05:45.579 --> 05:47.048
No, I meant in our relationship.

05:47.089 --> 05:49.208
All right, we need a game plan here.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.413
My dad and sister are here.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.548
Let's keep a low profile --
light and surfacy.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.221
But aren't we wasting
a great opportunity

05:54.262 --> 05:55.318
to learn more about me?

05:55.323 --> 05:57.258
We are not gonna be
the sideshow gay couple.

05:57.299 --> 05:58.487
Okay, nothing too personal.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.089
For God's sake, no bedroom stuff.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.629
We're representing a community.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.397
And how are you two doing here?

06:03.438 --> 06:04.957
We're very good, very healthy.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.095
Very happy. Yes.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.997
Cam, would you like to switch positions?

06:08.002 --> 06:10.067
I'm not allowed to talk about that.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.307
How's it going here with you two?

06:13.348 --> 06:15.367
Not good. He's not even trying.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.706
Sounds like you're stuck in that drawer.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.541
Sounds like you're stuck
in that metaphor.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.776
What's holding you back, Jay?

06:19.781 --> 06:21.310
I don't like to be held like this.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.045
Why? 'Cause you feel vulnerable?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.447
I don't know.

06:24.452 --> 06:28.089
It just... Reminds me of something.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.819
Go with that. You're safe here.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.459
I don't want to be safe here.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.755
I don't want to talk about this.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.590
About what? Tell me.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.393
It's like the time
my mom held me like this

06:37.398 --> 06:39.328
when my dog ran away
and never came back.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.068
She kept telling me
they didn't know how it got out,

06:41.109 --> 06:42.765
but I knew.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.907
I left the gate open. It was my fault.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.337
I lost checkers. Ay!

06:49.977 --> 06:52.074
I can't take this.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.148
Wait, what -- what just happened?
I don't know.

06:54.189 --> 06:56.445
I think he's not used
to feeling emotions.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.819
Maybe it was too much for him.

06:57.860 --> 06:58.915
No, no, this is good.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.017
Some people's junk drawers are so full,

07:01.022 --> 07:02.251
it's a struggle to open them.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.253
W-was he holding his chest?

07:04.258 --> 07:06.688
Sí! Something seemed wong.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.093
Jay, are you okay? It's Gloria.

07:10.098 --> 07:12.158
Dad. Dad, come on.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.963
Ay, it's locked.

07:13.968 --> 07:14.828
D-dad, open up.

07:14.836 --> 07:16.432
Hang on, I got a paperclip.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.234
Be careful. He's very raw.

07:18.239 --> 07:20.569
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

07:20.575 --> 07:23.905
Jay! Huh? Oh.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.711
I'm still sad.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.000
_

07:31.652 --> 07:33.148
You prefer to hide in the bathroom

07:33.153 --> 07:34.621
than to deal with your emotions!

07:34.662 --> 07:35.889
Gloria, what's the big deal?

07:35.930 --> 07:39.488
The big deal is that
we're raising a child together,

07:39.493 --> 07:40.727
and you have a chance

07:40.768 --> 07:42.887
to make him different than those two.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.056
Hello. Us?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.432
I'm sorry. What's wrong with us?

07:45.473 --> 07:46.728
I'd take a bullet for you,

07:46.733 --> 07:48.302
but you two are kind of neurotic.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.798
We're not neurotic.
Do people say that we're neurotic?

07:49.803 --> 07:50.737
They don't say that, do they?

07:50.778 --> 07:52.397
Yes. Yes.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.403
All the junk wants to
come out of the drawer.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.838
Can you feel it? I can.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.139
No, Jay doesn't feel anything.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.078
I feel lots of things.

07:58.119 --> 07:59.738
Annoyed that I'm missing my game,

07:59.746 --> 08:01.976
joy that the steelers are winning.
Oh, what is the score?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.579
We're not gonna talk
about football here!

08:03.584 --> 08:04.518
Gloria's right.

08:04.559 --> 08:05.647
We should talk about deeper things

08:05.652 --> 08:07.921
like those awkward years
between 14 to 6.

08:07.962 --> 08:09.089
Oh. Yes.

08:09.130 --> 08:10.757
When do we get to talk about
the dumb things

08:10.798 --> 08:11.954
that our husbands do?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.956
Gloria, thank you.
I'm glad you said that.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.530
You're welcome.
At least somebody's helping.

08:16.571 --> 08:19.099
Because that kind of language
is counterproductive.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.868
Oh, snap.

08:20.909 --> 08:24.098
This next exercise will teach us
how to communicate our needs

08:24.104 --> 08:26.840
in a constructive
and non-threatening manner.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.208
We do that all the time.

08:28.249 --> 08:30.005
Very constructively communicated.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.006
Would one of my couples
like to help me demonstrate

08:32.011 --> 08:33.041
for the rest of the group?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.706
Yes, we would. We'd love to help.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.775
How is this low profile?
Oh, come on, it'll fun.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.018
Your chair, please, cam. Sure.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.986
Face this way. Thank you.

08:40.028 --> 08:43.317
Now, I'd like you both
to think of a behavior

08:43.323 --> 08:45.721
of your partner's
that you would like to change.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.386
But we're going to avoid phrases

08:47.394 --> 08:49.391
like "you always" and "you never",

08:49.396 --> 08:52.456
and instead put it in terms
of how we feel. Okay.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.795
Mitch, you'll start.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.068
Okay.

08:55.109 --> 08:57.866
Sometimes, I wish you
wouldn't wear blue so much

08:57.871 --> 09:01.737
because I feel jealous
that you look so good in it.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.311
Now, cam, let Mitch know
if you heard him

09:04.352 --> 09:05.979
and if you feel you can do that.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.048
I did hear that.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.044
Okay.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.746
And I will try to wear less blue.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.347
Very good. Very good.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.588
Maybe dig a little deeper in the drawer.

09:14.629 --> 09:18.353
Well, sometimes when you don't
use a coaster with a -- a drink,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.488
I get anxious because
I love our furniture

09:20.494 --> 09:21.762
and we bought it together.

09:21.803 --> 09:25.160
Aww, that's very sweet. I hear that.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.425
And I'm gonna try
and use a coaster more.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.568
Okay. Excellent, both of you.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.698
Mitch, keep going.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.239
Yeah, so, uh...Sometimes
when you leave the room

09:32.280 --> 09:34.508
and you don't turn off
the lights, I just feel --

09:34.549 --> 09:35.938
seriously? That again?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.177
Surfacy.

09:37.218 --> 09:38.437
Well, I told you not to harp
on me about the lights.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.575
Oh, because this is the first

09:39.580 --> 09:40.876
that I'm hearing about the coasters.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.349
Here we go.

09:42.390 --> 09:43.845
Okay, I don't appreciate the smirking.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.047
I hear you, Mitchell,

09:45.052 --> 09:48.292
and I will try to smirk
when you're not looking.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.360
I feel like if Andy weren't
engaged, we'd have a chance.

09:53.401 --> 09:55.190
And if Reuben were
just a little bit older

09:55.195 --> 09:56.892
and didn't wear prescription shoes --

09:56.897 --> 09:58.457
it'd still be gross. I know.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.225
What are we gonna do?
We should both just end it.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.030
I am not killing myself.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.795
No! Break up with them.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.472
Oh, God.

10:05.513 --> 10:08.570
You deserve somebody that
isn't engaged to somebody else.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.305
Yeah, and you deserve to be with someone

10:10.310 --> 10:11.640
who didn't take baths with Luke.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.035
I already tried to dump him once.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.576
Hopefully it'll go better this time.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.717
Look, I'm sick of hiding our love.

10:16.758 --> 10:18.877
If you're ashamed of me -- I am.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.582
Then maybe we should break up.
We should.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.984
No, please don't break up with me.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.585
You're the -- the smartest,

10:23.590 --> 10:25.587
most beautiful girl on the planet.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.961
Fine.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.157
I'm gonna text Andy right now

10:29.162 --> 10:30.559
and tell him we need to talk today,

10:30.564 --> 10:31.331
and you should, too.

10:31.372 --> 10:32.260
I can't text him.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.395
He lost his phone privileges

10:33.400 --> 10:34.896
until he gets his Spanish grade back up,

10:34.901 --> 10:36.999
but I'll just go hang
around the playground

10:37.004 --> 10:38.572
till his kickball practice is over.

10:38.613 --> 10:40.407
I'm glad we talked.

10:40.448 --> 10:42.067
Me too.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.265
This is how we're gonna stay on track

10:43.276 --> 10:44.406
for the rest of our lives --

10:44.411 --> 10:46.011
by always being there for each other.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.610
He plays kickball?

10:48.615 --> 10:50.912
Equipment manager.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.415
Now that we're learning
to communicate constructively,

10:53.420 --> 10:55.589
let's put those new skills to use.

10:55.630 --> 10:56.518
Thank you.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.420
I want everyone to write down

10:58.425 --> 11:01.755
everything about your partner
that drives you crazy.

11:01.762 --> 11:02.758
Really?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.097
The drawers are open. Dig in.

11:04.138 --> 11:05.927
Sounds a little marriage-endy,
doesn't it?

11:05.932 --> 11:08.430
I mean, it does, but not for us.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.095
Maybe...

11:10.103 --> 11:11.803
Oh, huh, interesting.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.008
Phil, there's nothing
that bugs you about Claire?

11:15.049 --> 11:15.768
Nope.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.436
Not even "me likey"?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.940
What's he talking about? I have no idea.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.775
He says you say it a lot
and it drives him crazy.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.049
Phil.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.346
Okay, uh, Claire. Yeah.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.619
I love you. I know.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.215
But when you use that expression,

11:27.220 --> 11:31.319
it makes me feel, um...Icky.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.489
But, I mean, I've hardly
ever even used the expression --

11:34.494 --> 11:36.463
me likey Sushi,
me likey "game of thrones",

11:36.504 --> 11:38.060
me likey chardonnay.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.725
It does hit my ear wrong.
But you know what? Forget it.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.070
I'm sorry.
I got nothing to complain about.

11:43.111 --> 11:44.538
Me lucky. Mnh-mnh.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.635
Phil, never apologize for your feelings.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.905
I thought we're not
supposed to say "never".

11:49.910 --> 11:51.978
Good catch, Jay. Thank you.

11:52.019 --> 11:55.077
As the kids say, it's
going to get real up in here,

11:55.082 --> 11:56.850
but trust me, after that,

11:56.891 --> 12:00.549
once I've guided you through
the extremely specific steps

12:00.554 --> 12:02.651
in deciding what goes back in the drawer

12:02.656 --> 12:04.516
and what gets thrown out,

12:04.524 --> 12:07.160
you will be the best version
of yourselves.

12:07.201 --> 12:09.329
It always works. Don't say "always".

12:09.370 --> 12:10.258
Thank you.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.760
Let's get writing.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.162
Nothing is off-limits.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.597
These are your private thoughts,
and you are entitled to them.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.574
Excuse me.

12:20.541 --> 12:21.670
You think I'm too loud?

12:21.675 --> 12:22.965
Shh! Shh!

12:22.976 --> 12:24.036
How am I loud?

12:24.044 --> 12:25.512
Well, you take in too much air

12:25.553 --> 12:28.081
and you expel that air
with large and sudden bursts.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.249
That's how.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.746
Oh, so you're saying
that I am full of hot air?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.219
No, I'm saying just the opposite.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.388
None of the air stays in you. Hmm.

12:34.429 --> 12:37.218
The lights again.
Now you've written it down?

12:37.224 --> 12:39.560
I'm trying to stick to the small stuff.

12:39.601 --> 12:40.689
Oh, well, congratulations.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.329
You nailed it,
because that's real small.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.759
It -- okay, it bothers me, all right?

12:43.764 --> 12:47.000
I-I've asked you very nicely
to turn off the lights.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.168
Constantly.

12:48.209 --> 12:50.037
It's like we're londoners
hiding from war planes.

12:50.078 --> 12:51.833
Why did you write down "teepee joke"?

12:51.838 --> 12:53.507
Debra said these are my personal
and private thoughts.

12:53.548 --> 12:54.903
I love that joke.
I tell it all the time.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.177
It's funny. To you.

12:57.218 --> 12:59.675
Okay. Listen up, guys.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.710
This guy walks into
his shrink's office and he says,

13:01.715 --> 13:05.045
"doc, what's wrong with me?
I'm a teepee. I'm a wigwam."

13:05.052 --> 13:07.020
And the doc says,

13:07.061 --> 13:09.785
"That's your problem. You're two tents."

13:09.790 --> 13:11.286
Do you get it? Two tents.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.127
That's bad, Claire. That's really bad.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.687
You made her like that.

13:15.696 --> 13:17.356
If you let her feel things,

13:17.364 --> 13:19.132
maybe she'll know what is funny.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.467
Don't care what you people think.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.463
Me likey.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.364
Mm.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.137
What is wrong with "me likey"?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.097
Claire... Yes.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.065
...I love you. Oh, then stop saying it!

13:27.074 --> 13:29.543
It just seems a little childish. Really?

13:29.584 --> 13:32.312
'Cause you're the one who can't
stop playing with his pogo stick.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.380
You know what? Mm-hmm?

13:33.421 --> 13:34.910
Maybe you'd be happier

13:34.915 --> 13:37.945
if you played with my pogo stick
once in a while. Oh, my God!

13:37.951 --> 13:40.248
What's sad is they're actually
talking about a pogo stick.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.318
What's sad is you love
electricity more than me.

13:42.523 --> 13:44.858
It's like we have
a deranged second grader

13:44.899 --> 13:45.918
bouncing around the neighborhood.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.756
When did you get so old?! Oh!

13:47.761 --> 13:48.829
I mean, I love you!

13:48.870 --> 13:50.326
All right, cam,

13:50.331 --> 13:51.827
it's been a pet peeve of mine
since I was a kid,

13:51.832 --> 13:55.030
and I've asked you so many times
that when you ignore me,

13:55.035 --> 13:57.595
it feels a little passive-aggressive.

13:57.605 --> 13:59.735
And when you nag me constantly,

13:59.740 --> 14:02.670
it feels like I'm talking to my mother.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.772
When I have to nag you,

14:03.777 --> 14:05.574
it makes me feel like I am your mother,

14:05.579 --> 14:07.009
which could be why it's been a month

14:07.014 --> 14:08.711
since we played with
each other's pogo sticks.

14:08.716 --> 14:09.576
Oh. Ay.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.880
Oh, my God!

14:11.885 --> 14:13.445
How do you think we feel, Mitchell?!

14:13.454 --> 14:14.430
Oh!

14:14.530 --> 14:17.086
Miss, this is not going
the way it should be.

14:17.091 --> 14:18.859
Why don't you tell us how to fix this?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.356
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

14:20.361 --> 14:21.929
No, no, no!

14:21.970 --> 14:23.859
You have to help us
put this back together!

14:23.864 --> 14:24.999
It's a family emergency.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.829
Trust me, it cannot be
as bad as this one.

14:27.635 --> 14:29.125
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

14:29.136 --> 14:30.296
But I have to go pick up my son

14:30.304 --> 14:32.439
because my idiot ex-husband
loaned his car

14:32.480 --> 14:33.769
to his latest tinder whore.

14:33.774 --> 14:35.142
We paid good money for this.

14:35.183 --> 14:37.278
No, it was only $84.

14:37.319 --> 14:38.507
Excuse me?

14:38.512 --> 14:40.848
I would've paid more,
but nobody else was bidding.

14:40.889 --> 14:43.178
That's great.

14:43.184 --> 14:45.119
You know what? I deserve it.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.549
This is what you get for dumbing
down 30 years of research

14:48.556 --> 14:51.954
for a trite analogy of a junk drawer.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.289
Just because my editor told me

14:53.294 --> 14:54.862
it would get me on the "Ellen" show.

14:54.903 --> 14:55.858
You were on "Ellen"?

14:55.863 --> 14:57.398
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.295
I danced my way into America's heart,

14:59.300 --> 15:02.369
and that's why I'm stuck here on
a Sunday afternoon for 80 bucks.

15:02.410 --> 15:04.239
Wait. You can't leave now.

15:05.306 --> 15:06.736
All our junk is out!

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
_

15:14.813 --> 15:16.748
Hey. Hey.

15:16.789 --> 15:18.445
That's a cool shirt. You look nice.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.980
I have to cut you off right there.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.482
The shirt stays on.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.547
I have to hang up on this Booty call.

15:23.555 --> 15:24.715
Wait, what?

15:24.723 --> 15:27.392
You and me, this -- this has to stop.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.728
I'm so racked with guilt.

15:29.769 --> 15:31.558
I keep giving money
to different charities.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.661
I even fronted a Zach braff
movie on kickstarter.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.226
Andy, slow down.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.332
No, you're not gonna talk me into it.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.734
I'm even wearing embarrassing
underwear just in case.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.236
Oh, God, you're making this
so much easier.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.141
Look, I texted you
to say the same thing.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.107
You did?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.081
Yeah.

15:49.122 --> 15:52.246
I'm trying to be a better person.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.221
And, ironically, you're one of
the reasons why, but...

15:56.755 --> 15:59.815
A better person does not hook up
with an engaged person.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.459
So, what now?

16:05.464 --> 16:08.100
I don't know.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.268
We're still gonna see each other.

16:09.309 --> 16:10.768
You work for, like, half my family.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.368
Do I remove you from my calling circle?

16:14.373 --> 16:17.009
I think that's between you
and your wireless carrier.

16:17.050 --> 16:20.707
I guess that's that.

16:20.712 --> 16:22.309
It's not like it's goodbye forever.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.183
It's just...

16:24.224 --> 16:26.451
When we run into each other from now on,

16:26.492 --> 16:29.316
we keep our clothes on.

16:29.321 --> 16:33.421
Yes. Totally.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.525
But, you know...

16:38.530 --> 16:39.960
If things were different --

16:39.965 --> 16:41.825
I know.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.373
Bye, Haley.

16:48.707 --> 16:49.703
Bye.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.168
So, that's it? It's over?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.873
I can't believe she just left like that.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.147
Great. Now what?

16:55.188 --> 16:56.376
I know what you're all thinking,

16:56.381 --> 16:59.179
and, yes, I will take over
as group leader.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.319
No one's thinking that.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.387
I'm the only one with improv experience.

17:02.428 --> 17:03.647
Oh, really?

17:03.655 --> 17:06.185
Or was I the only white member
of ha ha blacksheep?

17:06.191 --> 17:07.921
I seem to remember
bringing down the hizouse

17:07.925 --> 17:09.756
with such classic characters
as a scared tourist,

17:09.761 --> 17:11.157
quarterback, and Bryant gumbel.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.060
I'll tag you in if I need you.
All right, everyone.

17:13.065 --> 17:16.194
This first exercise is called
entrances and exits.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.330
Let me go first.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.366
I'm leaving to watch the football game.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.767
No, señor! Jay, no.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.107
Oh, dear God!

17:22.147 --> 17:24.104
The only reason we stirred all this up

17:24.108 --> 17:25.377
is 'cause Mrs. Magoo here

17:25.417 --> 17:27.737
thought she was bidding
on a home organizer.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.506
I knew exactly what I was doing!

17:30.515 --> 17:32.675
I have tried everything.

17:32.684 --> 17:36.021
I just needed a new way to
get you to express your feelings

17:36.062 --> 17:38.919
and to allow other people
to express theirs.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.420
I need you to be fine

17:40.425 --> 17:43.255
with Manny dancing around
the living room when he's happy

17:43.262 --> 17:45.197
and Joe crying when he's sad.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.894
You don't see the downside
to all this? No.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.096
Mitchell, you want to weigh in here?

17:49.101 --> 17:51.531
We're all reliving it.

17:51.536 --> 17:52.866
How about you two?

17:52.871 --> 17:55.707
You feel good about getting all
this stuff out in the open?

17:55.748 --> 17:57.404
Let me just make one thing
perfectly clear.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.778
There were two tents.

17:59.819 --> 18:03.877
T-e-n-t-s and t-e-- you're right.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.280
It's a horrible joke.
But it's all your fault.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.545
I told you!

18:07.552 --> 18:09.721
For the record,
we are just as grossed out

18:09.762 --> 18:11.551
at the thought of you all having sex --

18:11.556 --> 18:14.886
that's it! I'm out!
What the hell are we doing?

18:14.893 --> 18:17.062
Dancing around, telling secrets

18:17.103 --> 18:18.558
like girls at a slumber party.

18:18.563 --> 18:21.061
I can just imagine
my old man with his buddies

18:21.066 --> 18:23.926
sitting at their lawn chairs,
laughing their asses off

18:23.935 --> 18:25.632
that I missed a whole day of football

18:25.637 --> 18:27.897
'cause I'm trying to get
in touch with my emotions.

18:27.906 --> 18:32.572
These guys didn't do that crap.
These were men!

18:32.577 --> 18:34.574
His best friend Tommy Ryan

18:34.579 --> 18:36.609
lost half a finger
in a sheet metal press.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.475
Waited until his shift ended
to go to the hospital.

18:39.484 --> 18:41.253
I broke my collar bone
in a football game.

18:41.294 --> 18:45.018
There was dad up in the stands
giving me the old "be tough".

18:45.023 --> 18:47.459
So I played two more downs
before I passed out.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.324
My date, maryjo klumsky,

18:50.329 --> 18:53.098
left the senior dance with another guy.

18:53.139 --> 18:54.428
Broke my heart.

18:54.433 --> 18:57.502
2:00 A.M. at the kitchen table,
my old man's telling me,

18:57.543 --> 19:00.500
"eat the sandwich and forget about her."

19:00.505 --> 19:04.705
Feelings!

19:04.710 --> 19:06.178
I didn't even cry at his funeral.

19:06.219 --> 19:07.338
You believe that?

19:07.346 --> 19:09.276
The guy was my whole world.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.877
Not a tear.

19:10.882 --> 19:14.648
Everybody looking at me like --
like I didn't love him.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.693
But he knew.

19:19.157 --> 19:20.717
He had to know, right?

19:20.726 --> 19:22.786
Of course he did.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.799
Son of a bitch,
that felt good getting that out.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.829
Wow.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.230
I know.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.295
They just won therapy.

19:32.804 --> 19:35.040
Hey, it's me. I broke up with Reuben.

19:35.081 --> 19:36.370
I knew he'd be crushed,

19:36.375 --> 19:37.735
so I did it quickly like ripping off

19:37.743 --> 19:39.278
one of his incredible Hulk band-aids.

19:39.319 --> 19:41.008
So, how about you? Did you do it?

19:41.013 --> 19:44.111
Yep. I sure did.

19:44.616 --> 19:48.186
"Why do we choose partners
so different from ourselves?

19:49.688 --> 19:51.118
It's not fate or chance

19:51.123 --> 19:54.593
or clichés like 'the heart wants
what the heart wants.'"

19:56.695 --> 19:59.355
"we choose our partners
because they represent

19:59.365 --> 20:02.325
the unfinished business
from our childhood."

20:07.272 --> 20:09.770
Phil.

20:09.775 --> 20:10.865
Phil.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.206
"And we choose them

20:12.211 --> 20:15.111
because they manifest
the qualities we wish we had."

20:16.382 --> 20:18.117
I'm afraid I'm not fun enough for you.

20:18.158 --> 20:20.514
Huh? Yeah.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.616
My sayings aren't cute,
my jokes aren't funny, and --

20:22.621 --> 20:24.790
and you're gonna get sick of me
once the kids leave

20:24.831 --> 20:27.187
and you realize how truly crazy I am.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.228
Really? Mm-hmm.

20:29.269 --> 20:33.127
Honey, I already know how crazy you are.

20:33.132 --> 20:36.869
"In doing so, in choosing
such a challenging partner,

20:36.910 --> 20:39.638
and working to give them what they need,

20:39.679 --> 20:43.303
we chart a course for our own growth."

20:43.308 --> 20:45.138
Go to sleep, Jay-Jay.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.641
I'm telling you, the woman is a genius.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
_

20:57.289 --> 21:00.754
I didn't feel like going to
my grandpa's house that Sunday,

21:00.759 --> 21:03.356
so I pretended to have a cold.

21:03.361 --> 21:05.530
Wouldn't you know it,
a few days later...

21:05.571 --> 21:07.760
Oh, no.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.226
Yep. I got the cold.

21:10.235 --> 21:13.595
I thought it was karma,
so I hopped on my bike

21:13.605 --> 21:15.365
and I rode straight to my grandpa's.

21:15.373 --> 21:19.077
I climbed in his lap
and I hugged him so hard.

21:19.118 --> 21:21.574
We even shared an ice cream cone.

21:21.579 --> 21:23.748
It's a memory I'll always cherish,

21:23.789 --> 21:25.208
'cause in a crazy coincidence,

21:25.216 --> 21:27.716
he got a cold, too,
and was dead within a week.
