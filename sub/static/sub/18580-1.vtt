00:53.764 --> 00:57.646
- I pity a country that

00:57.646 --> 01:00.744
The synergy with air, land, and sea forces

01:00.744 --> 01:03.899
and our ability to
control the battle space

01:03.899 --> 01:06.891
and seize the high ground is devastating.

01:06.891 --> 01:09.968
All countries respect the
power of the United States

01:09.968 --> 01:12.831
and they respect how dominant
we are in this region.

01:12.831 --> 01:16.164
And we get better and better and better.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.567

01:32.616 --> 01:33.449
- Tonight to ten,

01:33.449 --> 01:36.374
a rare glimpse of China's
ambitious expansion

01:36.374 --> 01:39.229
in one of the world's
most contested regions.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.097
We report from the South China Sea,

01:41.097 --> 01:42.998
where the Chinese are warning off anyone

01:42.998 --> 01:46.282
who comes too close to
their building program.

01:46.282 --> 01:47.315
- We continue our look this morning

01:47.315 --> 01:49.689
at what China does not want you to see.

01:49.689 --> 01:51.287
The United States says the superpower

01:51.287 --> 01:54.513
is reclaiming land in the South China Sea.

01:54.513 --> 01:56.654
- The fact that we're dealing
with a situation right now

01:56.654 --> 02:00.053
where we, the US, has to
be much more aggressive

02:00.053 --> 02:01.789
in dealing with the Chinese government.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.211
- CNN has learned that the US Navy

02:03.211 --> 02:05.043
is about to send a destroyer there.

02:05.043 --> 02:06.963
Let's go to our CNN chief--

02:06.963 --> 02:09.149
- [Announcer] CNN got
exclusive access to classified

02:09.149 --> 02:13.327
US surveillance flights over the islands.

02:13.327 --> 02:16.969
- [John Narrating] The threat
of China is becoming big news.

02:16.969 --> 02:19.875
The media is beating the drums of war

02:19.875 --> 02:23.190
as the world is being
primed to regard China

02:23.190 --> 02:25.166
as a new enemy.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.425
- [Announcer] China's alarming creation of

02:26.425 --> 02:29.353
entirely new territory
in the South China Sea

02:29.353 --> 02:31.623
is one part of a broader military push

02:31.623 --> 02:36.149
that some fear is to challenge
US dominance in the region.

02:36.149 --> 02:37.994
- [John Narrating] China
is building airstrips

02:37.994 --> 02:41.743
in the South China Sea on disputed islands

02:41.743 --> 02:45.491
condemned by an international tribunal.

02:45.491 --> 02:47.983
This is now a flashpoint for war

02:47.983 --> 02:50.150
between China and America.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.507
What is not news is that
China itself is under threat.

02:57.860 --> 03:01.118
These American bases form a giant noose,

03:01.118 --> 03:05.285
encircling China with
missiles, bombers, warships.

03:06.165 --> 03:09.372
All the way from Australia
through the Pacific,

03:09.372 --> 03:11.039
to Asia, and beyond.

03:12.935 --> 03:15.341
- If you were in Beijing looking out,

03:15.341 --> 03:17.491
you stood on the tallest
building in Beijing

03:17.491 --> 03:19.256
and looked out at the Pacific Ocean,

03:19.256 --> 03:21.919
you'd see American warships.

03:21.919 --> 03:23.651
You'd see Guam is about to sink

03:23.651 --> 03:26.470
because there's so many
missiles pointed at China.

03:26.470 --> 03:27.859
You'd look up at Korea and see

03:27.859 --> 03:30.385
American armaments pointing at China.

03:30.385 --> 03:34.063
You'd see Japan, which is basically,

03:34.063 --> 03:36.958
Japan's a glove over the American fist.

03:36.958 --> 03:40.298
I think if I was Chinese, I'd
have a little to worry about

03:40.298 --> 03:42.629
about American aggressiveness.

03:42.629 --> 03:44.764
- And we have China surrounded

03:44.764 --> 03:46.995
and we're doing more
all the time to try and

03:46.995 --> 03:51.162
keep it surrounded and deepen
that containment of China.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.143
But China presents a fascinating case

03:54.143 --> 03:56.297
of a country that is independent,

03:56.297 --> 03:59.995
doesn't have foreign
bases on its territory,

03:59.995 --> 04:01.027
growing very rapidly,

04:01.027 --> 04:03.906
not as rapidly now as it did for 30 years,

04:03.906 --> 04:07.720
but still the second-ranking
economy in the world.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.482
- We have an adversary

04:09.482 --> 04:12.818
and that adversary is
China and that adversary,

04:12.818 --> 04:16.067
unless there is dramatic
reform inside China,

04:16.067 --> 04:18.233
will be our enemy someday.

04:19.152 --> 04:23.747
- One myth I think really
needs to be dispelled

04:23.747 --> 04:27.918
is that somehow China's
aiming to replace America

04:27.918 --> 04:32.186
and gonna run the world. (laughs)

04:32.186 --> 04:34.570
First of all, the Chinese
are not that stupid.

04:34.570 --> 04:37.487
The West, with its Christian roots,

04:40.269 --> 04:44.436
are about converting other
people into their beliefs.

04:46.137 --> 04:48.552
The Chinese are not about that.

04:48.552 --> 04:51.893
Again, I'm not degrading
the Western culture.

04:51.893 --> 04:54.145
I'm just pointing out the inherent nature,

04:54.145 --> 04:56.287
the DNA's of two different cultures.

04:56.287 --> 04:59.905
The Chinese 2000 years
ago built the Great Wall

04:59.905 --> 05:03.822
to keep the barbarians
out, not to invade them.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.654
- [John Narrating] As the
world's economic power

05:06.654 --> 05:11.021
moves rapidly to Asia, the
response of the Untied States

05:11.021 --> 05:15.999
is to deploy the majority
of its naval forces to Asia

05:15.999 --> 05:17.877
and the Pacific.

05:17.877 --> 05:22.304
This massive military buildup
is known in Washington as

05:22.304 --> 05:23.971
the "Pivot to Asia."

05:24.880 --> 05:26.547
The target is China.

05:30.276 --> 05:33.460
The great power game in the 21st century

05:33.460 --> 05:35.460
is called perpetual war.

05:38.249 --> 05:41.606
For America's unchallenged arms industry,

05:41.606 --> 05:44.808
the annual prize is huge profits

05:44.808 --> 05:48.975
from almost 600 billion
dollars of military spending.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.538
- [Announcer] Once an
imaginary weapon on Star Wars,

05:54.538 --> 05:57.379
the electromagnetic gun is now reality.

05:57.379 --> 05:58.740
- You're sitting here thinking about these

05:58.740 --> 06:01.102
next-generation and futuristic ideas

06:01.102 --> 06:04.015
and we've got scientists
who have designed these

06:04.015 --> 06:06.015
and it's coming to life.

06:07.354 --> 06:11.883
- [John Narrating] And the
smartest weapons need enemies.

06:11.883 --> 06:13.833
- As a Pacific nation, the United States

06:13.833 --> 06:16.712
will play a larger and long-term role

06:16.712 --> 06:19.170
in shaping this region and its future.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.898
I have directed my national security team

06:20.898 --> 06:24.247
to make our presence and
mission in the Asian-Pacific

06:24.247 --> 06:25.497
a top priority.

06:26.561 --> 06:30.925
- In one sense, is the US
already at war with China?

06:30.925 --> 06:32.060
- Yes.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.090
On the ground and in the air.

06:34.090 --> 06:37.783
The winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, President Barack Obama,

06:37.783 --> 06:39.848
has committed to trillions

06:39.848 --> 06:43.476
of dollars to our nuclear arsenal.

06:43.476 --> 06:46.692
He's committing trillions
of future dollars

06:46.692 --> 06:50.768
to war in space and we need
an enemy for all this money

06:50.768 --> 06:53.268
and China's the perfect enemy.

06:58.427 --> 07:02.486
- The aim of this film
is to break a silence.

07:02.486 --> 07:06.410
The United States and China
may well be on a path to war

07:06.410 --> 07:10.211
and nuclear war is no longer unthinkable.

07:10.211 --> 07:12.447
In a few years, China
has become the world's

07:12.447 --> 07:15.449
second biggest economic power.

07:15.449 --> 07:18.488
The United States is the
world's biggest military power,

07:18.488 --> 07:21.072
with bases and missiles and ships

07:21.072 --> 07:24.417
covering every continent, every ocean.

07:24.417 --> 07:27.784
China is a threat to this
dominance, says Washington,

07:27.784 --> 07:30.127
but who is the threat?

07:30.127 --> 07:34.445
This film is about shifting
power and great danger.

07:34.445 --> 07:36.899
It's also a film about the human spirit

07:36.899 --> 07:40.742
and the rise of an extraordinary
resistance among people

07:40.742 --> 07:42.772
on the front line of a coming war

07:42.772 --> 07:46.552
where the words "never
again" have an urgent meaning

07:46.552 --> 07:48.498
for all of us.

07:48.498 --> 07:51.081
(somber music)

07:56.833 --> 07:58.490
- [John Narrating] This is Bikini,

07:58.490 --> 08:01.679
the rim of an ancient underwater volcano

08:01.679 --> 08:04.103
in the Marshall Islands.

08:04.103 --> 08:07.164
With its necklace of 23 islands,

08:07.164 --> 08:11.331
Bikini is a place of beauty
and silence and menace.

08:16.424 --> 08:19.096
Look closely where the Emerald Lagoon

08:19.096 --> 08:22.912
suddenly falls into a vast black hole.

08:22.912 --> 08:24.037
This is the crater of one of

08:24.037 --> 08:27.175
the greatest manmade explosions,

08:27.175 --> 08:30.008
the hydrogen bomb they call Bravo.

08:31.076 --> 08:33.631
It vaporized an entire island

08:33.631 --> 08:37.782
and poisoned almost
everything and everyone.

08:37.782 --> 08:41.948
As our plane flew low, we seemed
to touch its deathly void.

08:56.432 --> 09:00.332
The Marshall Islands lie
in the vast Pacific Ocean

09:00.332 --> 09:03.440
between the United States and Asia.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.792
Captured from the
Japanese in World War Two,

09:06.792 --> 09:10.082
they've long been
America's strategic secret,

09:10.082 --> 09:13.249
it's stepping stone to Asia and China.

09:14.676 --> 09:17.259
(guitar music)

09:20.020 --> 09:24.697
People here sustain themselves
for thousands of years

09:24.697 --> 09:28.447
with abundant fish,
breadfruit, and coconuts.

09:32.178 --> 09:36.345
They were skilled navigators
who sailed by the stars.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.678
Westerners might call this paradise.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.572
All that changed in 1946

10:05.572 --> 10:09.000
when the United States took
over the Marshall Islands

10:09.000 --> 10:12.479
as a Trust Territory with an obligation

10:12.479 --> 10:16.646
to protect the health and
wellbeing of the people.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.694
A nightmare began.

10:20.694 --> 10:23.294
The islands were turned into a laboratory

10:23.294 --> 10:25.866
for the testing of nuclear weapons

10:25.866 --> 10:28.533
and the people into guinea pigs.

10:32.388 --> 10:34.802
- Crossroads, scene 24, take two.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.355
(clicks)

10:36.355 --> 10:38.204
- [John Narrating] In
this propaganda film,

10:38.204 --> 10:41.824
the Bikini islanders are being deceived.

10:41.824 --> 10:45.913
Unknown to them, plans
were already underway

10:45.913 --> 10:48.746
to destroy their paradise forever.

10:50.001 --> 10:54.409
- Will you ask King Judah that
the United States government

10:54.409 --> 10:58.106
now wants to attempt to turn this great,

10:58.106 --> 11:02.189
destructive force into
something good for mankind

11:03.157 --> 11:05.977
and that these experiments here at Bikini

11:05.977 --> 11:09.099
are the first step in that direction.

11:09.099 --> 11:12.599
(speaks foreign language)

11:15.345 --> 11:16.178
Tell them that's fine,

11:16.178 --> 11:20.375
everything being in God's
hands, it must be good.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.875
(speaks foreign language)

11:27.148 --> 11:29.261
- [Announcer] 87 ships
take position three miles

11:29.261 --> 11:31.738
off Bikini to suffer the shattering impact

11:31.738 --> 11:34.205
of the fifth atomic bomb.

11:34.205 --> 11:36.019
- [John Narrating] An armada of warships

11:36.019 --> 11:38.519
was assembled in Bikini Lagoon

11:39.432 --> 11:42.220
in order to blow them to bits.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.970
(chain clanking)

11:50.673 --> 11:52.357
- [Announcer] The decks
of the 73 test ships

11:52.357 --> 11:54.152
anchored in Bikini Lagoon

11:54.152 --> 11:55.972
are scenes of feverish activity

11:55.972 --> 11:58.863
as scientists plot experimental programs

11:58.863 --> 12:00.823
designed to furnish data on blast effects

12:00.823 --> 12:02.896
of the mighty atom bomb.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.729
Animals of many kinds--

12:03.729 --> 12:05.916
- [John Narrating] Animals
were strapped to the decks

12:05.916 --> 12:08.166
like a perverse Noah's Ark.

12:09.336 --> 12:12.291
The experiment was to see how they died,

12:12.291 --> 12:13.624
how they burned.

12:15.755 --> 12:17.134
- [Announcer] Special
ointments are applied

12:17.134 --> 12:19.586
to determine their protective quality.

12:19.586 --> 12:21.275
Other parts of the exposed areas

12:21.275 --> 12:24.323
are being left bare to the atom blasts.

12:24.323 --> 12:26.988
- [Soldier] Three, two, one.

12:26.988 --> 12:29.488
(eerie music)

13:55.788 --> 13:57.487
- [John Narrating] Being on Bikini today

13:57.487 --> 13:59.237
is disturbing ghosts.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.671
I struggle through the
jungle to the bunker

14:02.671 --> 14:06.252
where they pressed the
button at 6:45 on the morning

14:06.252 --> 14:07.835
of the H-Bomb test.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.494
Now claimed by the undergrowth,

14:13.494 --> 14:17.494
it's like a subterranean
temple to modern times.

14:20.158 --> 14:22.854
They drank Milk Maid Powdered Milk,

14:22.854 --> 14:25.580
smoked Lucky Strike Cigarettes,

14:25.580 --> 14:30.531
and later this sign was
erected that's beyond irony.

14:30.531 --> 14:31.802
It says,

14:31.802 --> 14:34.863
"Please leave this
property as you find it,

14:34.863 --> 14:38.863
"thank you for your
kindness and understanding."

14:45.380 --> 14:47.025
(water drips)

14:47.025 --> 14:49.608
(jovial music)

14:52.223 --> 14:54.374
- [Announcer] The Momselles
give their all for their art

14:54.374 --> 14:55.308
and you can just bet

14:55.308 --> 14:58.950
that audience is giving
with the wolf calls.

14:58.950 --> 15:01.066
- [Male Announcer] The bikini, named after

15:01.066 --> 15:03.342
the atomic explosion in the Pacific.

15:03.342 --> 15:05.872
The bikini was an explosion everywhere.

15:05.872 --> 15:10.602
- [John Narrating] In 1946, the
bikini swimsuit was launched

15:10.602 --> 15:13.564
to celebrate the nuclear explosions

15:13.564 --> 15:17.167
that had destroyed life on Bikini Island.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.168
The inventor of the bikini, a Frenchman,

15:20.168 --> 15:21.585
made his fortune.

15:22.814 --> 15:27.133
Today a bikini body is
promoted in magazines

15:27.133 --> 15:30.383
as an object of desire and good health.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.471
The bodies of the people
of Bikini and other islands

15:35.471 --> 15:38.571
are the most irradiated in the world.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.904
All these women have had thyroid cancer.

16:16.744 --> 16:20.618
Today, Bikini is unfit for human life.

16:20.618 --> 16:24.370
Radiation poisons the food and water,

16:24.370 --> 16:29.226
and issues registered
unsafe on a Geiger Counter.

16:29.226 --> 16:31.722
The abandoned cemetery looks out to where

16:31.722 --> 16:35.721
the sun rose one morning, then rose again

16:35.721 --> 16:36.888
as apocalypse.

16:39.969 --> 16:43.033
The equivalent of one Hiroshima bomb

16:43.033 --> 16:45.723
was exploded in these islands

16:45.723 --> 16:47.556
everyday for 12 years.

16:52.418 --> 16:55.759
A scarred beauty has
returned to the island

16:55.759 --> 16:57.676
but the people haven't.

16:58.728 --> 17:03.385
Exiled to barren islands,
many of them starved.

17:03.385 --> 17:07.563
In 1968, President
Lyndon Johnson told them

17:07.563 --> 17:09.480
it was safe to go home.

17:10.583 --> 17:14.627
(Geiger Counter clicks)

17:14.627 --> 17:16.396
But it wasn't safe.

17:16.396 --> 17:19.979
And the US authorities
knew it wasn't safe.

17:42.146 --> 17:45.585
- What happened as a
result of the Bravo test

17:45.585 --> 17:48.808
was that a cover-up was launched

17:48.808 --> 17:51.225
very shortly after March one.

17:52.708 --> 17:55.968
There's such a history
of wrong information,

17:55.968 --> 17:58.613
outright lies, deception.

17:58.613 --> 18:02.780
There was no attempt to take
the most conservative approach

18:04.066 --> 18:06.410
and make sure that everybody was okay.

18:06.410 --> 18:10.994
- They knew the way the
fallout was going to go.

18:10.994 --> 18:12.976
And they took that risk and went ahead

18:12.976 --> 18:15.703
and detonated the bomb, knowing full well

18:15.703 --> 18:17.970
which way it was going to go.

18:17.970 --> 18:21.225
They still had an opportunity to evacuate,

18:21.225 --> 18:23.056
even on the day of the shot.

18:23.056 --> 18:24.679
But these people were not evacuated,

18:24.679 --> 18:26.022
we were not evacuated,

18:26.022 --> 18:28.737
and the people in the
path were not evacuated.

18:28.737 --> 18:31.987
So that only leaves one to believe that

18:33.103 --> 18:35.994
number one, the United States
needed some guinea pigs

18:35.994 --> 18:40.764
to study what the effects
of radiation would do.

18:40.764 --> 18:43.294
And that's a pretty strong indication

18:43.294 --> 18:45.500
that the United States knew that.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.983
- It seems extraordinary, here we are,

18:47.983 --> 18:50.990
this far into the 21st century,

18:50.990 --> 18:53.432
talking to people still frightened

18:53.432 --> 18:56.788
of all that nuclear
fallout, all those tests,

18:56.788 --> 18:58.665
all those years ago.

18:58.665 --> 19:00.688
The impression I get is that

19:00.688 --> 19:02.985
there's so little trust among people.

19:02.985 --> 19:04.766
- The US is trying to provide as much

19:04.766 --> 19:08.632
information, as much good
information as we can.

19:08.632 --> 19:11.812
And so I wouldn't accept
the characterization that

19:11.812 --> 19:15.212
there've been lies and cover-ups.

19:15.212 --> 19:19.738
- The word guinea pigs comes
up a lot from these survivors.

19:19.738 --> 19:23.013
- I would refer you to our
embassy website on that.

19:23.013 --> 19:23.986
- I've read it.

19:23.986 --> 19:26.278
- And that question was looked at

19:26.278 --> 19:28.442
during the Clinton administration

19:28.442 --> 19:32.676
and that was not the
conclusion they came to.

19:32.676 --> 19:34.962
- [John Narrating] The secret
of the Marshall Islands

19:34.962 --> 19:36.212
is Project 4.1.

19:37.788 --> 19:42.348
Declassified documents
reveal a scientific program

19:42.348 --> 19:45.110
that began as a study of mice

19:45.110 --> 19:49.277
and became a study of human
beings exposed to radiation.

19:52.389 --> 19:53.791
- [Radio Announcer] Chicago
is where it all began.

19:53.791 --> 19:56.774
And to the AEC Argonnne
Labs in Chicago last week

19:56.774 --> 20:00.115
came seven men, natives
of the Marshall Islands.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.846
Levin is from Omelek.

20:01.846 --> 20:03.228
He and the rest were irradiated by our

20:03.228 --> 20:06.887
March 19th '54 hydrogen bomb test.

20:06.887 --> 20:08.812
John is mayor of Rongelap,

20:08.812 --> 20:11.836
which is 100 miles from Bikini.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.980
John, as we said, is a savage,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.299
but a happy, amenable savage.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.893
His grandfather ran almost
naked on his small atoll.

20:19.893 --> 20:22.327
The white man brought money and religion

20:22.327 --> 20:24.622
and a market for his copa.

20:24.622 --> 20:29.413
John Reeds knows about God
and is a pretty good mayor.

20:29.413 --> 20:33.863
The iron room is a radiation
detector for human beings.

20:33.863 --> 20:36.496
Inside John the mayor,

20:36.496 --> 20:38.260
whose first visit to
the white man's country

20:38.260 --> 20:41.295
meant San Francisco cable
cars and Chicago skyscrapers

20:41.295 --> 20:43.889
and streamlined trains,

20:43.889 --> 20:46.456
whose first visit to
the white man's country

20:46.456 --> 20:48.123
meant the iron room.

20:49.699 --> 20:52.652
A savage governs his life by ritual

20:52.652 --> 20:54.543
and he understands this because

20:54.543 --> 20:56.648
he thinks of it as a new ritual.

20:56.648 --> 20:59.266
Sitting alone inside the room,

20:59.266 --> 21:03.361
outside, a strange kind of
priest in a long, white coat.

21:03.361 --> 21:05.521
When the ritual of the iron
room was over for John,

21:05.521 --> 21:07.288
it began for the others.

21:07.288 --> 21:10.102
As each finished, he was told it was over

21:10.102 --> 21:13.269
and he was given apples and
other good things to eat.

21:13.269 --> 21:15.564
Then he took off the ritual clothing

21:15.564 --> 21:18.120
and the seven men put on
the suits and top coats

21:18.120 --> 21:20.006
they had been lent in Hawaii

21:20.006 --> 21:22.419
which they would return in
Hawaii on their way back

21:22.419 --> 21:27.187
in the Marshall Islands in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean.

21:27.187 --> 21:28.900
- The United States government documents

21:28.900 --> 21:32.135
clearly demonstrate that its scientists

21:32.135 --> 21:34.347
conducted human radiation experiments

21:34.347 --> 21:37.141
with Marshallese citizens.

21:37.141 --> 21:38.722
Some of our people were injected with

21:38.722 --> 21:42.722
or coerced to drink fluids
laced with radiation.

21:44.311 --> 21:47.852
Other experimentation
involved the impurposeful

21:47.852 --> 21:51.028
and premature resettlement of people

21:51.028 --> 21:54.420
on islands highly
contaminated by weapons tests

21:54.420 --> 21:58.367
to study how human beings absorb radiation

21:58.367 --> 22:01.240
from their foods and environment.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.823
(guitar music)

22:06.092 --> 22:08.894
- [John Narrating] These
people are guinea pigs.

22:08.894 --> 22:13.141
They are part of the
experiment Project 4.1.

22:13.141 --> 22:15.439
They're being returned to Rongelap,

22:15.439 --> 22:19.356
an island 100 miles from
Bikini by the US Navy.

22:20.414 --> 22:24.581
They were told repeatedly,
it was safe to go home.

22:26.465 --> 22:30.632
This happy couple believed
they were going home to safety.

22:31.626 --> 22:35.618
The man is John Anjain,
the mayor of Rongelap.

22:35.618 --> 22:40.068
The "happy savage" from
the iron room in Chicago.

22:40.068 --> 22:44.235
His wife is Madura, and this
is their baby son Lekage.

22:45.149 --> 22:48.982
They had no idea of the
horror that lay ahead.

22:51.332 --> 22:53.549
They are being returned to an island

22:53.549 --> 22:57.346
described by a US atomic energy official

22:57.346 --> 23:01.429
"as by far the most
contaminated place on earth."

23:02.433 --> 23:05.590
He added, "it will be
interesting to get a measure

23:05.590 --> 23:07.778
"of human uptake when people

23:07.778 --> 23:10.861
"live in a contaminated environment."

23:14.439 --> 23:18.661
The people of Rongelap
remained on their poison island

23:18.661 --> 23:20.994
for 28 years as guinea pigs.

23:22.724 --> 23:26.641
The objects of regular,
scientific examination.

24:04.638 --> 24:07.009
(bell rings)

24:07.009 --> 24:10.380
The islanders pleaded
with the US authorities

24:10.380 --> 24:13.611
to move them to safety as evidence emerged

24:13.611 --> 24:15.695
of the second generation,

24:15.695 --> 24:18.362
the children were also poisoned.

24:35.063 --> 24:37.287
Desperate to leave, the islanders

24:37.287 --> 24:41.003
called on Greenpeace to rescue them.

24:41.003 --> 24:43.654
This ship, the Rainbow Warrior,

24:43.654 --> 24:47.821
moved the entire population
to an uncontaminated island.

24:48.934 --> 24:51.601
They called it Operation Exodus.

24:53.338 --> 24:55.921
(native music)

25:29.521 --> 25:31.822
(eerie music)

25:31.822 --> 25:34.168
This is Doctor Robert Conard,

25:34.168 --> 25:36.227
a leading medical scientist

25:36.227 --> 25:39.719
of Brookhaven National Laboratories.

25:39.719 --> 25:43.131
Conard devoted his distinguished career

25:43.131 --> 25:45.381
to examining the islanders.

25:50.238 --> 25:53.969
He wrote, "the habitation of
these people on the island

25:53.969 --> 25:58.645
"will afford the most valuable
ecological radiation data

25:58.645 --> 26:00.062
"on human beings.

26:01.035 --> 26:03.923
"The various radio isotopes present

26:03.923 --> 26:07.877
"can be traced from the
soil to the food chain

26:07.877 --> 26:09.877
"and into human beings."

26:15.238 --> 26:19.415
Doctor Conard gained the
trust of whole communities

26:19.415 --> 26:22.834
when he brought the islanders
to New York to be examined,

26:22.834 --> 26:25.004
he showed them the sights

26:25.004 --> 26:27.754
and had them over for a barbecue.

26:35.146 --> 26:38.729
When John Anjain's son
Lekage died aged 18,

26:40.260 --> 26:43.962
Doctor Conard sent the
man they called a savage

26:43.962 --> 26:45.729
a sympathy card.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.562
From your friend, Bob.

26:51.889 --> 26:56.056
In 1957, Madura Anjain was
the smiling young woman

26:57.310 --> 27:00.664
seen here on her way back to Rongelap,

27:00.664 --> 27:04.581
unaware of the danger
she and her family faced.

27:08.220 --> 27:11.459
This is Madura 28 years later,

27:11.459 --> 27:13.121
grieving the death of her son

27:13.121 --> 27:15.788
Lekage from radiation poisoning.

28:46.771 --> 28:48.802
Like her son and her husband,

28:48.802 --> 28:51.719
Madura died from a virulent cancer.

28:54.246 --> 28:57.813
- I don't see any great
clinics that have been

28:57.813 --> 29:01.172
established by, if not
the Department of Energy,

29:01.172 --> 29:04.108
certainly not by the US government.

29:04.108 --> 29:06.728
- There's a clinic downtown in Majuro.

29:06.728 --> 29:08.715
There's also a Whole Body Counter.

29:08.715 --> 29:11.773
You can have the plutonium in
your body measured as well.

29:11.773 --> 29:13.523
Anyone can, for free.

29:15.764 --> 29:18.999
- [John Narrating] This is
the plutonium measuring shop

29:18.999 --> 29:23.100
where they'll tell you
how radioactive you are.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.333
People waiting to be tested

29:25.333 --> 29:27.229
are welcomed with a video

29:27.229 --> 29:30.312
showing their islands being blown up.

29:35.769 --> 29:38.818
And this reassuring commentary.

29:38.818 --> 29:42.318
(speaks foreign language)

29:57.941 --> 29:59.946
This is Rinok, a refugee from

29:59.946 --> 30:03.161
the poisoned island of Rongelap,

30:03.161 --> 30:07.328
whose family owned land and
lived a secure, prosperous life.

30:08.314 --> 30:12.181
Now she lives in a shack
in the capital, Majuro,

30:12.181 --> 30:15.181
with her children and grandchildren.

30:16.345 --> 30:19.012
She has no water, no sanitation.

30:34.899 --> 30:38.232
- [John] And power, she has electricity?

30:47.033 --> 30:50.106
- [John Narrating] In
1986, the United States

30:50.106 --> 30:54.404
granted limited independence
to the Marshall Islanders

30:54.404 --> 30:57.665
on condition that they accepted a mere

30:57.665 --> 31:01.130
150 million dollars compensation

31:01.130 --> 31:05.360
for the damage caused by nuclear testing.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.517
A claims tribunal was set up

31:07.517 --> 31:09.786
and soon ran out of money

31:09.786 --> 31:14.600
and appealed to the US Congress
more than a decade ago,

31:14.600 --> 31:16.350
still awaits a reply.

31:36.822 --> 31:40.604
Darlene Keju-Johnson was
a young health worker

31:40.604 --> 31:43.200
who became the champion of her people

31:43.200 --> 31:46.852
after she discovered the full
extent of their suffering

31:46.852 --> 31:49.454
caused by nuclear testing that

31:49.454 --> 31:54.253
many more islands were poisoned
than the Americans claimed.

31:54.253 --> 31:55.156
(applause)

31:55.156 --> 31:59.239
This remarkable speech in
1983 broke the silence.

32:00.230 --> 32:04.238
- I bring greetings from
the Marshall Islands

32:04.238 --> 32:07.200
and throughout Micronesia.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.630
We have hundreds of women
who have miscarriages.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.784
We have leukemia cancers.

32:13.784 --> 32:15.628
We have thyroid cancers.

32:15.628 --> 32:17.937
We have stillborn babies.

32:17.937 --> 32:21.273
We have nowadays, I
just got back from home

32:21.273 --> 32:25.276
and I've talked to many women
and men in the population,

32:25.276 --> 32:29.014
is that we have babies
we call jellyfish babies.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.128
A baby is born on a labor table

32:31.128 --> 32:33.858
and it moves up and down like this.

32:33.858 --> 32:35.339
It's a colorful, ugly thing

32:35.339 --> 32:37.743
and it is not shaped like a human being.

32:37.743 --> 32:40.844
It moves up and down like
this on a labor table

32:40.844 --> 32:43.041
because that thing is breathing.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.291
That is a baby.

32:47.657 --> 32:52.492
- [John Narrating] In 1982,
Darlene married Giff Johnson,

32:52.492 --> 32:55.742
the author of this tribute to his wife.

32:57.799 --> 33:00.549
- Darlene was one of the liveliest,

33:00.549 --> 33:04.048
most entertaining individuals that

33:04.048 --> 33:07.712
I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.

33:07.712 --> 33:10.545
She was a voice for the voiceless.

33:13.313 --> 33:16.405
- [John Narrating] Like so
many Marshall Islanders,

33:16.405 --> 33:18.988
Darlene died of cancer, age 45.

33:28.374 --> 33:32.378
This is the largest of
the islands, Kwajalein,

33:32.378 --> 33:35.975
occupied by one of
America's most important

33:35.975 --> 33:37.642
and secretive bases.

33:40.073 --> 33:42.839
Known as the Ronald Reagan Test Site,

33:42.839 --> 33:44.978
it's a missile launch pad that commands

33:44.978 --> 33:48.978
the Pacific Ocean all the
way to Asia and China.

33:52.184 --> 33:54.684
(waves crash)

33:55.762 --> 33:58.513
Here, the people of the Marshall Islands

33:58.513 --> 34:01.323
are once again being
subjected to the testing

34:01.323 --> 34:05.490
of weapons of mass destruction
designed for a coming war.

34:10.453 --> 34:13.429
The base is part of a remarkable plan

34:13.429 --> 34:15.179
known as Vision 2020.

34:16.848 --> 34:20.152
Devised in the 1990's,
its aim is described

34:20.152 --> 34:23.319
officially as full-spectrum dominance.

34:24.853 --> 34:28.271
This means control of all land, sea, air,

34:29.550 --> 34:31.382
cyberspace, and space.

34:32.743 --> 34:35.909
- [Radio] Five, four, three, two, one,

34:37.800 --> 34:38.632
ignition.

34:40.898 --> 34:45.009
- [John Narrating] From
California, almost 5000 miles away,

34:45.009 --> 34:49.016
the US Air Force tests it's
intercontinental missiles

34:49.016 --> 34:52.266
by firing them at the Marshall Islands.

34:54.856 --> 34:57.816
- Imagine a missile coming
screaming out of the sky.

34:57.816 --> 34:59.902
It's absolutely terrifying.

34:59.902 --> 35:04.069
I think that there's really
nothing that I can imagine

35:04.905 --> 35:07.970
that would be more terrifying than this.

35:07.970 --> 35:11.607
And we're talking about devices that

35:11.607 --> 35:14.607
any one of them could go off course.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.808
- [John Narrating] None of
this disturbs life on the base,

35:18.808 --> 35:22.576
where small town America
has been recreated,

35:22.576 --> 35:25.826
a wonderland of the suburban good life.

35:27.986 --> 35:28.986
- Thank you.

35:31.271 --> 35:33.488
(upbeat music)

35:33.488 --> 35:34.625
- Fabulous.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.754
There's nothing better than
living on a tropical island.

35:37.754 --> 35:40.282
- I pretty much have
beachfront property, you know?

35:40.282 --> 35:42.532
It's great, I love it here.

35:51.547 --> 35:55.122
- [John Narrating] Just across
the bay is Ebeye Island.

35:55.122 --> 35:57.533
Known as the slum of the Pacific,

35:57.533 --> 36:00.444
more than 12,000 people live here

36:00.444 --> 36:04.213
on a strip of land less than a mile long.

36:04.213 --> 36:08.631
Many of them refugees from
what is now the missile base

36:08.631 --> 36:12.381
and from islands poisoned
by nuclear testing.

36:16.209 --> 36:18.332
Every day, people from Ebeye are

36:18.332 --> 36:21.020
brought to work on the missile base

36:21.020 --> 36:24.353
to water the gardens and the golf course

36:27.054 --> 36:30.721
then they are ferried
back to their poverty.

36:33.482 --> 36:36.232
This is apartheid in the Pacific.

36:50.294 --> 36:52.711
(flies buzz)

37:00.995 --> 37:02.941
- Ebeye needs a lot of things.

37:02.941 --> 37:05.441
Medicine, education, and jobs.

37:06.298 --> 37:08.131
Vegetables and fruits.

37:09.073 --> 37:10.567
- Vegetables and fruits.

37:10.567 --> 37:11.400
- Yes.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.341
- Here we are, it's a tropical island,

37:13.341 --> 37:14.652
and you need vegetables and fruits.

37:14.652 --> 37:15.485
- Yes.

37:17.813 --> 37:20.154
- [John Narrating] Fish,
vegetables and fruit

37:20.154 --> 37:22.487
were once abundant on Ebeye.

37:24.067 --> 37:28.441
Today, fish is contaminated
by toxic pollutants

37:28.441 --> 37:31.858
says the Environmental Protection Agency.

37:34.287 --> 37:37.277
Now the only food most people can afford

37:37.277 --> 37:40.128
is processed and imported.

37:40.128 --> 37:44.295
They have the highest rate
of diabetes in the world.

37:49.906 --> 37:52.851
- When someone gets really ill,

37:52.851 --> 37:55.082
do they go to the
hospital over on the base

37:55.082 --> 37:59.249
because they've got a pretty
modern clinic over there.

38:00.491 --> 38:03.658
- They don't treat them with medicine.

38:04.920 --> 38:09.669
They just go there for taking
the plug and then x-ray.

38:09.669 --> 38:12.942
- So what happens when
somebody is seriously ill?

38:12.942 --> 38:15.472
- They cannot do anything.

38:15.472 --> 38:18.389
- The most consistent example given

38:19.762 --> 38:23.762
is the example of the
Ronald Reagan Missile Site

38:24.832 --> 38:27.228
and Ebeye next to it.

38:27.228 --> 38:29.718
On the Ronald Reagan Missile Site

38:29.718 --> 38:33.055
is a vivid example of the United States,

38:33.055 --> 38:35.638
golf courses and swimming pools

38:36.804 --> 38:39.054
and all kinds of amenities.

38:40.278 --> 38:44.320
Right next to it is what is
called the slum of the Pacific.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.590
- It's a challenge.

38:45.590 --> 38:48.842
Ebeye is in great need right now.

38:48.842 --> 38:50.860
We've talked about infrastructure.

38:50.860 --> 38:53.543
One of the projects the US is working with

38:53.543 --> 38:57.068
our Australian colleagues and
with the Asia Development Bank

38:57.068 --> 39:00.355
is a sewer and water project
desperately needed for Ebeye.

39:00.355 --> 39:02.927
Ebeye's overcrowded,
the schools need repair.

39:02.927 --> 39:07.362
- Actually, the US military
did a survey back in the 70's

39:07.362 --> 39:09.201
and found that the sewers didn't work

39:09.201 --> 39:12.522
and the water didn't run and
the electricity wasn't there.

39:12.522 --> 39:14.173
It only happened not all that long ago

39:14.173 --> 39:16.464
they found almost exactly the same thing.

39:16.464 --> 39:18.794
Why hasn't that been fixed?

39:18.794 --> 39:21.859
- There's complete agreement
that Ebeye should be a priority

39:21.859 --> 39:24.462
and not only because of
the current activities

39:24.462 --> 39:27.810
of the Ronald Reagan Space
and Missile Defense Site,

39:27.810 --> 39:31.248
but there's also now
an additional component

39:31.248 --> 39:33.676
that is providing for global security

39:33.676 --> 39:38.070
and that's the Space Fence
Project by the Air Force.

39:38.070 --> 39:39.942
- [John Narrating] Every missile fired

39:39.942 --> 39:43.289
on the Marshall Islands by the US military

39:43.289 --> 39:45.872
costs 100 million dollars each.

39:48.348 --> 39:52.901
This derelict school bus
is the only one on Ebeye.

39:52.901 --> 39:55.568
They can't afford to replace it.

40:10.352 --> 40:13.003
- The base is not good for us,

40:13.003 --> 40:17.390
the people of Marshall Islands,
we have no need for it.

40:17.390 --> 40:19.267
- [John] It's been used to test missiles

40:19.267 --> 40:21.934
to fire at countries like China.

40:23.442 --> 40:27.627
- Yes, and anywhere else if they want to.

40:27.627 --> 40:32.034
- [John] What would you
like to see happen there?

40:32.034 --> 40:33.951
- I want our land back.

40:41.738 --> 40:44.321
(violin music)

40:48.668 --> 40:50.226
- [John Narrating] This is Shanghai,

40:50.226 --> 40:53.246
the historic port on the Yangtze River,

40:53.246 --> 40:55.079
China's greatest city.

40:58.406 --> 41:00.578
I have arranged to meet
the American author

41:00.578 --> 41:03.938
James Bradley, whose
latest best-selling book

41:03.938 --> 41:08.105
The China Mirage, reveals an
extraordinary hidden history

41:09.093 --> 41:12.762
of American power and modern China.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.876
- It was almost illegal
for someone like me

41:15.876 --> 41:18.870
to know of Chinese for almost
all of American history.

41:18.870 --> 41:22.064
The Chinese came to America to mine gold

41:22.064 --> 41:24.722
and build the railroads
and Americans decided

41:24.722 --> 41:26.324
we didn't like the competition,

41:26.324 --> 41:29.887
so in 1882 we had the
Chinese Exclusion Acts

41:29.887 --> 41:32.651
which kept the Chinese
out of the United States

41:32.651 --> 41:34.508
for about 100 years.

41:34.508 --> 41:37.407
So you have the largest
population in the world

41:37.407 --> 41:39.507
that can't come to the United States,

41:39.507 --> 41:41.103
so at just the point we're putting up

41:41.103 --> 41:44.253
the Statue of Liberty
saying, we welcome everybody,

41:44.253 --> 41:46.305
we were erecting a wall saying,

41:46.305 --> 41:49.805
we welcome everybody except those Chinese.

41:51.429 --> 41:54.135
- [John Narrating] Fear
of a rising China today

41:54.135 --> 41:57.463
is the latest chapter in
a history of propaganda

41:57.463 --> 42:01.630
that presented the Chinese
as uncouth and infantile.

42:08.451 --> 42:11.779
To western popular and political culture,

42:11.779 --> 42:15.132
the Chinese became the Yellow Peril.

42:15.132 --> 42:16.255
(piano music)

42:16.255 --> 42:20.243
And racial stereotypes
bore the constant theme

42:20.243 --> 42:21.826
of fear and threat.

42:23.881 --> 42:28.082
- [Announcer] Boris Karloff
as the evil Fu Manchu.

42:28.082 --> 42:32.165
His passion for power
twisting his brilliant mind

42:33.744 --> 42:37.911
as he revels in the horrors of
human sacrifice and torture.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.478
Behind the mask of Fu Manchu.

42:49.862 --> 42:53.380
- [John Narrating] This
caricature of an entire people

42:53.380 --> 42:56.047
concealed another agenda: opium.

43:02.258 --> 43:05.386
For the American elite
in the 19th century,

43:05.386 --> 43:07.969
China was a goal mine of drugs.

43:10.384 --> 43:11.398
- Warren Delano,

43:11.398 --> 43:14.328
the grandfather of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

43:14.328 --> 43:16.769
was the American opium king of China.

43:16.769 --> 43:19.152
He was the biggest American opium dealer

43:19.152 --> 43:20.709
second to the British.

43:20.709 --> 43:24.364
He welcomed the first
American ship into China

43:24.364 --> 43:26.786
to help out with the opium wars.

43:26.786 --> 43:28.771
Much of the east coast of America,

43:28.771 --> 43:32.259
Columbia, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,

43:32.259 --> 43:34.509
were born from opium money.

43:36.594 --> 43:38.992
The American Industrial Revolution

43:38.992 --> 43:41.848
was funded by huge pools of money.

43:41.848 --> 43:42.681
Where did this come from?

43:42.681 --> 43:44.562
It came from illegal drugs

43:44.562 --> 43:48.002
in the biggest market in the world: China.

43:48.002 --> 43:48.835
- Let me get this right.

43:48.835 --> 43:53.002
The grandfather of arguably
the most liberal president,

43:54.636 --> 43:58.511
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
was a drug runner.

43:58.511 --> 43:59.344
- Yes sir.

43:59.344 --> 44:03.340
Franklin Delano Roosevelt never
made much money in his life.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.808
He had public service jobs
that were very lowly paid,

44:06.808 --> 44:09.175
but he had yachts, he had summer homes,

44:09.175 --> 44:11.032
he had mansions in New York City.

44:11.032 --> 44:13.145
The kids went to private schools.

44:13.145 --> 44:17.032
He inherited a fortune from
Warren Delano, his father,

44:17.032 --> 44:20.828
who was the American opium king of China.

44:20.828 --> 44:24.606
If you scratch anyone with
the name Forbes in their name,

44:24.606 --> 44:29.046
John Forbes Kerry, Secretary
of State John Forbes Kerry--

44:29.046 --> 44:30.625
- That's the present Secretary of State.

44:30.625 --> 44:31.476
- Yes sir.

44:31.476 --> 44:32.981
You'll find opium money.

44:32.981 --> 44:36.763
His great-grandfather was an opium dealer.

44:36.763 --> 44:38.236
How big was opium money?

44:38.236 --> 44:40.860
Opium money built the
first industrial city

44:40.860 --> 44:43.923
in the United States,
Lowell, Massachusetts.

44:43.923 --> 44:47.238
It built the first five
railroads in the United States.

44:47.238 --> 44:49.314
Opium money all over the east coast,

44:49.314 --> 44:50.478
but it wasn't talked about.

44:50.478 --> 44:52.430
It was called the China Trade.

44:52.430 --> 44:54.759
And if you go to various museums,

44:54.759 --> 44:57.759
you can see teas and silks exhibited

44:59.093 --> 45:03.905
and they keep quiet about
all that big opium money.

45:03.905 --> 45:06.657
- [John Narrating] In the
scramble to get opium money,

45:06.657 --> 45:09.269
China was invaded and colonized

45:09.269 --> 45:12.686
by Britain and the other imperial powers.

45:15.002 --> 45:18.752
Foreign armies grabbed
whole swaths of China.

45:19.795 --> 45:22.919
This is the American
army in Tiananmen Square,

45:22.919 --> 45:24.252
Peking, in 1900.

45:27.730 --> 45:30.854
Great cities like Shanghai were taken over

45:30.854 --> 45:32.854
and declared concessions

45:34.262 --> 45:37.640
and foreigners lived a life
of privilege and luxury

45:37.640 --> 45:41.557
amidst terrible poverty
imposed on the Chinese.

45:51.531 --> 45:54.980
A resistance known as the Boxer Rebellion

45:54.980 --> 45:57.397
was put down with a savagery.

45:58.976 --> 46:01.672
This rape of China set the tone

46:01.672 --> 46:04.516
for how China was perceived in the West

46:04.516 --> 46:06.766
well into the 20th century.

46:09.139 --> 46:11.722
This is the distinguished historian

46:11.722 --> 46:16.476
Theodore H. White, an
advisor to the White House,

46:16.476 --> 46:18.393
speaking in the 1960's.

46:19.365 --> 46:24.203
- Perhaps China is too vast
to be governed by mercy.

46:24.203 --> 46:26.953
Yet if Chinese mind craves order,

46:28.262 --> 46:29.866
they must be brought to recognize

46:29.866 --> 46:34.033
they are the biggest factor
in the world's disorder.

46:35.410 --> 46:39.327
And we must untangle the
madness of their mind.

46:40.625 --> 46:42.755
The most difficult task in the world

46:42.755 --> 46:46.255
is to reach the minds of men who hate you.

46:47.590 --> 46:50.208
- [John Narrating] What White
was really complaining about

46:50.208 --> 46:52.106
was the loss of a China that

46:52.106 --> 46:55.162
the imperial West could dominate

46:55.162 --> 46:59.017
and the defeat of General Chiang Kai-Shek,

46:59.017 --> 47:02.558
who with his famously
powerful Christian wife,

47:02.558 --> 47:06.725
Mei-ling Soong, guarded
America's interests in China.

47:08.409 --> 47:12.727
That is, until they
were thrown out in 1949

47:12.727 --> 47:16.394
by a communist revolution
led by Mao Zedong.

47:17.782 --> 47:20.765
- Mao had beaten Chiang
Kai-Shek three times

47:20.765 --> 47:24.607
in huge battles involving
millions of combatants.

47:24.607 --> 47:27.261
Mao was a winner in this contest from

47:27.261 --> 47:30.678
the early 1930's on, but we
knew very little about it

47:30.678 --> 47:34.345
and people don't
understand that even today.

47:35.230 --> 47:37.481
- [Announcer] Shanghai
hears the message clearly

47:37.481 --> 47:40.657
as foreign businessmen
board up their shops.

47:40.657 --> 47:44.574
Go now, go quickly, for communism marches.

47:44.574 --> 47:47.420
Take what you can, but flee.

47:47.420 --> 47:49.402
In pell-mell haste, the Western powers

47:49.402 --> 47:51.532
evacuate the city they have built,

47:51.532 --> 47:54.580
for good and bad alike must leave.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.346
The businessmen come for profit

47:56.346 --> 47:59.247
as well as missionaries come to heal

47:59.247 --> 48:01.997
must say goodbye as out the Yancy

48:02.868 --> 48:04.814
steams the last of Western influence

48:04.814 --> 48:06.981
and farewell to a century.

48:08.267 --> 48:10.517
(shouting)

48:11.912 --> 48:14.436
- [John Narrating] Even today,
it's difficult to understand

48:14.436 --> 48:17.853
the paranoia ignited by Mao's revolution.

48:21.212 --> 48:23.388
- As we look at China on the map,

48:23.388 --> 48:26.438
we can see that China is the basic cause

48:26.438 --> 48:28.546
of all of our troubles in Asia.

48:28.546 --> 48:32.213
- I believe that for
the sake of our safety,

48:34.630 --> 48:38.797
it is necessary to be
prepared for the possibility

48:39.909 --> 48:43.992
of a Chinese missile attack
on the United States.

48:47.033 --> 48:49.363
- [John Narrating] One
of the myths about Mao

48:49.363 --> 48:54.236
is that he was an implacable
enemy of the capitalist West.

48:54.236 --> 48:56.986
(chorus singing)

49:04.695 --> 49:08.851
Shanghai today is a
prosperous international city

49:08.851 --> 49:12.684
still run by the communists,
at least in name.

49:22.213 --> 49:25.757
- When I was last in China
more than a generation ago,

49:25.757 --> 49:30.626
the loudest noise was the
tinkling of bicycle bells.

49:30.626 --> 49:33.655
Mao had just died, the streets were dark,

49:33.655 --> 49:35.493
the universities were closed.

49:35.493 --> 49:38.003
The chaos of the cultural revolution

49:38.003 --> 49:41.206
had given way to a great silence.

49:41.206 --> 49:45.661
"We're exhausted," was the
freest comment I heard.

49:45.661 --> 49:49.569
Coming back, the change
is barely comprehensible.

49:49.569 --> 49:53.900
Here in Shanghai, the
freedom bears no comparison.

49:53.900 --> 49:56.327
Yes, there are issues with human rights,

49:56.327 --> 49:59.293
especially the right to
speak against the state

49:59.293 --> 50:01.794
and challenge its power.

50:01.794 --> 50:04.569
Since I was last here, millions of people

50:04.569 --> 50:06.774
have been lifted out of poverty,

50:06.774 --> 50:11.283
many of them into an
entirely new middle class.

50:11.283 --> 50:14.564
This epic is still barely
understood in the West,

50:14.564 --> 50:18.064
or should that be willfully misunderstood?

50:19.076 --> 50:22.677
The truth is that China
has matched America

50:22.677 --> 50:25.730
at its own great game of capitalism

50:25.730 --> 50:27.813
and that is unforgivable.

50:31.606 --> 50:34.501
- [John Narrating] One measure
of China's new capitalism

50:34.501 --> 50:36.418
is the Hurun Rich List.

50:37.951 --> 50:40.459
This league table of China's mega-rich

50:40.459 --> 50:43.472
is published by Rupert Hoogewerf,

50:43.472 --> 50:47.139
an old Etonian whose
Chinese name is Hu Run.

50:50.031 --> 50:52.021
He's received many awards,

50:52.021 --> 50:54.854
including China's Man of the Year.

50:55.872 --> 50:58.859
- This year, 2015, has probably been

50:58.859 --> 51:01.047
the most extraordinary
year of wealth creation

51:01.047 --> 51:03.346
in the history of China again.

51:03.346 --> 51:06.238
I've been doing this
list for 15, 16 years.

51:06.238 --> 51:08.988
I've never seen a year like 2015.

51:10.243 --> 51:14.348
Normally for 200 million
pounds or 300 million dollars,

51:14.348 --> 51:17.618
we find say about 800,000 people.

51:17.618 --> 51:20.405
This year, 2015, it's doubled.

51:20.405 --> 51:22.851
There'll be more dollar
billionaires known about in China

51:22.851 --> 51:24.222
than in the US.

51:24.222 --> 51:25.911
So the US, up until now,

51:25.911 --> 51:29.262
has been the leader in terms of

51:29.262 --> 51:33.062
the most successful business
tycoons in the world.

51:33.062 --> 51:36.604
China 2015, will have overtaken the US.

51:36.604 --> 51:37.604
So, amazing.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.519
- [John Narrating] Modern China
is full of telling ironies,

51:46.519 --> 51:49.528
not least this museum
that was once the house

51:49.528 --> 51:52.587
where Mao and his
comrades secretly founded

51:52.587 --> 51:55.670
the communist party of China in 1921.

52:10.944 --> 52:14.063
Today it stands in the
heart of an exclusive,

52:14.063 --> 52:16.896
very capitalist shopping district.

52:26.268 --> 52:30.310
- When you leave this shrine
to China's great revolution,

52:30.310 --> 52:32.549
you're confronted by a surreal spectacle.

52:32.549 --> 52:33.574
For right outside where the

52:33.574 --> 52:36.223
Chinese communist party was born,

52:36.223 --> 52:39.180
are the very symbols of capitalism.

52:39.180 --> 52:43.396
Starbucks, Apple, Cartier,
Dolce and Gabbana,

52:43.396 --> 52:47.461
and down there perhaps the
free market's greatest triumph:

52:47.461 --> 52:51.081
bottled water that insures you live young,

52:51.081 --> 52:55.881
costing six pounds for a
small bottle in my hotel.

52:55.881 --> 52:59.333
Would Mao spin in his tomb if he was here?

52:59.333 --> 53:00.882
I'm not so sure.

53:00.882 --> 53:04.284
Hidden history is always
the key to the truth.

53:04.284 --> 53:08.451
Five years before his great
communist revolution in 1949,

53:09.514 --> 53:13.532
Mao sent this secret
message to Washington.

53:13.532 --> 53:16.328
"China must industrialize," wrote Mao,

53:16.328 --> 53:19.940
"this can only be done by free enterprise.

53:19.940 --> 53:23.090
"Chinese and American
interests fit together

53:23.090 --> 53:25.863
"economically and politically.

53:25.863 --> 53:29.850
"America need not fear that
we will not be cooperative.

53:29.850 --> 53:32.994
"We cannot risk crossing America.

53:32.994 --> 53:35.494
"We cannot risk any conflict."

53:36.630 --> 53:38.463
Mao received no reply.

53:40.176 --> 53:41.843
Nothing has changed.

53:45.812 --> 53:47.559
- Mao Zedong was looking to be a friend

53:47.559 --> 53:50.329
with the United States from the beginning.

53:50.329 --> 53:52.184
Mao says, I will go meet

53:52.184 --> 53:54.441
Franklin Roosevelt in the White House.

53:54.441 --> 53:57.330
Mao reaches out in 1950 to Harry Truman.

53:57.330 --> 53:59.285
He reaches out to Dwight Eisenhower.

53:59.285 --> 54:01.368
His hand was tossed away.

54:05.467 --> 54:07.234
- [John Narrating] This opportunity that

54:07.234 --> 54:09.227
might have changed history,

54:09.227 --> 54:13.141
prevented wars, saved countless lives,

54:13.141 --> 54:16.449
was lost because the
truth of Mao's overtures

54:16.449 --> 54:20.032
was denied in the
Washington of the 1950's.

54:21.450 --> 54:25.658
State Department officials
who had carried Mao's messages

54:25.658 --> 54:29.491
were condemned unjustly
as communist traitors.

54:32.278 --> 54:36.444
- Everybody who knew Mao,
who spoke Chinese, was gone.

54:36.444 --> 54:38.828
In the 1950's, the State Department

54:38.828 --> 54:41.745
had no employees who spoke Chinese.

54:42.754 --> 54:45.054
It's resulted in us not having relations

54:45.054 --> 54:49.221
with the number one, most
populous country in the world.

54:51.861 --> 54:55.069
- [John Narrating] In 1979, this man,

54:55.069 --> 54:58.902
Deng Xaoping, became
China's paramount leader.

54:59.907 --> 55:04.074
He said, "Socialism does
not mean shared poverty."

55:08.869 --> 55:11.037
This was code for the most radical reform

55:11.037 --> 55:15.204
since Mao's revolution, the
return of capitalism to China,

55:17.459 --> 55:21.459
but this time controlled
by the communist party.

55:24.393 --> 55:26.060
"To be rich is glorious,"

55:26.060 --> 55:29.125
Deng was reported as saying.

55:29.125 --> 55:31.298
America was now threatened
by the emergence

55:31.298 --> 55:33.465
of a vast image of itself.

55:42.373 --> 55:45.177
This is one of the many very exclusive

55:45.177 --> 55:48.346
gated communities in Shanghai

55:48.346 --> 55:50.577
where an apartment is one of the prizes

55:50.577 --> 55:52.327
of the new communism.

55:58.014 --> 56:01.235
I'd arranged to see
Professor Zhang Weiwei,

56:01.235 --> 56:04.083
a close aide to the late Deng Xiaoping,

56:04.083 --> 56:06.250
the man who changed China.

56:07.913 --> 56:12.080
- Deng is really, extremely
long-term visionary leader

56:16.114 --> 56:20.234
with an exceedingly
long-term at strategic vision

56:20.234 --> 56:22.944
for his country and for his people.

56:22.944 --> 56:25.873
China is still following that path.

56:25.873 --> 56:28.296
Actually, this is really a tradition

56:28.296 --> 56:30.760
from China's long history.

56:30.760 --> 56:33.243
You look at even like Mao.

56:33.243 --> 56:35.767
He said we should surpass UK,

56:35.767 --> 56:38.209
by which we should
surpass the United States,

56:38.209 --> 56:41.582
so these tradition continues to this day.

56:41.582 --> 56:45.101
Even Xi Jinping to this day
is also doing this idea.

56:45.101 --> 56:49.092
Actually, what many Chinese have problem

56:49.092 --> 56:52.593
with the Western media is
the stereotypes about China.

56:52.593 --> 56:56.760
If you contend with stereotypes,
you miss so many things.

56:58.025 --> 57:00.491
If BBC broadcast something,

57:00.491 --> 57:03.915
they are happy to always mention
the communist dictatorship,

57:03.915 --> 57:05.165
this autocracy.

57:06.079 --> 57:08.006
Actually, with this kind of label

57:08.006 --> 57:11.597
you cannot understand this China as it is.

57:11.597 --> 57:15.347
But if you watch BBC or
CNN or read Economist

57:18.587 --> 57:21.845
and try to understand
China, it will be a failure.

57:21.845 --> 57:23.178
It's impossible.

57:24.351 --> 57:26.489
- Multiple parties fight
for political power

57:26.489 --> 57:28.098
and everyone holding on to them

57:28.098 --> 57:29.562
as the only path to salvation

57:29.562 --> 57:31.742
to the long-suffering, developing world.

57:31.742 --> 57:32.780
- [John Narrating] This is Eric Li,

57:32.780 --> 57:36.414
a Shanghai entrepreneur
educated in America

57:36.414 --> 57:38.954
and typical of a new, confident,

57:38.954 --> 57:41.121
outspoken political class.

57:42.889 --> 57:46.129
- In China, there are a lot of problems.

57:46.129 --> 57:50.719
But at the moment, the
Chinese, the party state,

57:50.719 --> 57:55.085
has proven an extraordinary
ability to change.

57:55.085 --> 57:56.548
I make the joke:

57:56.548 --> 58:00.125
in America you can
change political parties

58:00.125 --> 58:03.287
but you can't change the policies.

58:03.287 --> 58:05.119
In China you cannot change the party

58:05.119 --> 58:07.452
but you can change policies.

58:08.772 --> 58:13.538
In 65 or 66 years, China has
been run by one single party

58:13.538 --> 58:17.815
yet the political changes
that have taken place

58:17.815 --> 58:21.482
in China these past 66
years have been wider

58:22.498 --> 58:25.167
and broader and greater than probably

58:25.167 --> 58:27.858
any other major country in modern memory.

58:27.858 --> 58:30.282
- So in that time, China
ceased to be communist.

58:30.282 --> 58:31.552
Is that what you're saying?

58:31.552 --> 58:34.910
- Well, China is a market economy.

58:34.910 --> 58:36.066
It's a vibrant market economy

58:36.066 --> 58:38.087
but it is not a capitalist country.

58:38.087 --> 58:39.004
Here's why.

58:41.095 --> 58:44.171
There's no way a group of billionaires

58:44.171 --> 58:46.671
could control the party bureau

58:47.859 --> 58:51.776
as billionaires control
American policy making.

58:53.308 --> 58:56.207
So in China, you have a
vibrant market economy

58:56.207 --> 59:00.374
but capital does not rise
above political authority.

59:01.298 --> 59:04.548
Capital does not have enshrined rights.

59:07.024 --> 59:09.142
In America, capital,

59:09.142 --> 59:11.457
the interest of capital and capital itself

59:11.457 --> 59:14.457
has risen above the American nation.

59:16.316 --> 59:19.759
The political authority cannot
check the power of capital.

59:19.759 --> 59:21.731
That's why America is a capitalist country

59:21.731 --> 59:23.064
but China's not.

59:25.805 --> 59:27.354
- [John Narrating] This
is the ironic title

59:27.354 --> 59:30.940
of a best-selling book by Zhang Lijia,

59:30.940 --> 59:35.487
a journalist and critic
who lives in Beijing.

59:35.487 --> 59:38.529
- Many Americans imagine
that the Chinese people

59:38.529 --> 59:42.696
live a miserable, repressed
life with no freedom whatsoever.

59:47.200 --> 59:48.365
That's not quite true.

59:48.365 --> 59:52.497
If you speak to many
ordinary Chinese people,

59:52.497 --> 59:55.892
they will tell you they feel
their lives are quite free.

59:55.892 --> 59:59.163
Some 500 million people
have been lifted off poverty

59:59.163 --> 01:00:01.354
and some would say probably
600 million people.

01:00:01.354 --> 01:00:03.604
That's a great achievement.

01:00:05.206 --> 01:00:09.874
For many Americans, the Yellow
Peril has never left them.

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:12.972
I think there's a fear about China.

01:00:12.972 --> 01:00:15.224
There's a fear of China's rapid rise,

01:00:15.224 --> 01:00:18.381
but it also has a lot to do with China's

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.631
label as a communist state.

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:27.153
- China's objectives are modest

01:00:27.153 --> 01:00:29.403
compared with their weight.

01:00:30.785 --> 01:00:32.943
They're not trying to run the world.

01:00:32.943 --> 01:00:36.187
They're not even trying
to run the Asian-Pacific.

01:00:36.187 --> 01:00:38.889
I think they want to keep America

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:42.171
from dominating the Asian-Pacific.

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:45.346
So they have what they believe

01:00:45.346 --> 01:00:47.855
is their rightful place
in the Asian-Pacific,

01:00:47.855 --> 01:00:48.688
because of all civilizations

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:50.671
and all the history on their side,

01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:52.466
so their objectives are really modest

01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:54.883
compared with their capacity.

01:00:55.808 --> 01:00:58.211
- The new wealth in China,

01:00:58.211 --> 01:01:01.697
they often say this is the product of

01:01:01.697 --> 01:01:04.614
self-made entrepreneurial skill but

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.717
is it not also the product of

01:01:10.297 --> 01:01:13.127
the exploitation of people at the bottom,

01:01:13.127 --> 01:01:15.138
what are known in China as migrants.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:18.212
But they're not really
migrants, they're Chinese.

01:01:18.212 --> 01:01:21.906
- (laughs) If you really go to

01:01:21.906 --> 01:01:24.647
talk to these migrant workers,

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:28.132
you will find quite surprisingly,

01:01:28.132 --> 01:01:31.414
over the past five to seven years,

01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:35.331
they have experienced a
greater income increase

01:01:36.412 --> 01:01:39.132
than any other social groups.

01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:41.549
China is not a class society.

01:01:43.828 --> 01:01:47.828
- [John Narrating] But
China is a class society.

01:01:49.025 --> 01:01:51.973
These are the homes of migrant workers,

01:01:51.973 --> 01:01:55.556
people who build and
service the new China.

01:02:03.285 --> 01:02:06.139
Here it's not uncommon for three families

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.056
to share one tiny flat.

01:02:13.558 --> 01:02:18.195
- You know, you associate a
socialist country with equality

01:02:18.195 --> 01:02:21.406
but unfortunately it seems
the reform has started.

01:02:21.406 --> 01:02:22.797
China has become one of the

01:02:22.797 --> 01:02:25.504
most unequal societies in the world.

01:02:25.504 --> 01:02:27.477
The income gap is widening.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.686
Governments, I feel,
have retreated some of

01:02:29.686 --> 01:02:33.928
the responsibilities, left
the markets to take over,

01:02:33.928 --> 01:02:36.281
but the market does not
always treat women kindly.

01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:39.526
Some private companies
that would just refuse

01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:42.276
to hire child-bearing aged women.

01:02:43.865 --> 01:02:45.588
And sometimes when women became pregnant,

01:02:45.588 --> 01:02:47.494
they would sack them.

01:02:47.494 --> 01:02:49.670
Because they don't want to
pay their maternity leave.

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:53.974
And in fact, the income
gap has grown much bigger

01:02:53.974 --> 01:02:55.807
between men and women.

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.573
- Your old boss, Deng Xaoping,

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.460
presided over the bloodshed
in Tiananmen Square.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.627
What would you say to the
survivors of Tiananmen Square,

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:14.370
because so many of those did fight

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:19.210
for what they saw as
democratic change in China?

01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:24.175
- In 1989, there were
two political forces.

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:29.880
One of those were presented
by the Chinese students.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.845
Their hero was Mikhail Gorbachev,

01:03:32.845 --> 01:03:35.215
who happened to be in Beijing.

01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:36.728
Their slogan was,

01:03:36.728 --> 01:03:40.087
"Soviet Union's Today
is China's Tomorrow."

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:42.957
So the idea was political reform first,

01:03:42.957 --> 01:03:44.775
other reform second.

01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:47.289
Otherwise, China would be hopeless.

01:03:47.289 --> 01:03:49.705
Deng's message was the opposite.

01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:52.630
He thought Gorbachev was an idiot.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:56.853
He thought China must have
economic reform first,

01:03:56.853 --> 01:03:58.820
other reform second.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.487
This priority must be set clear.

01:04:02.769 --> 01:04:07.493
Unfortunately, at that
particular moment in 1989,

01:04:07.493 --> 01:04:11.594
the two political forces
could not reach a compromise.

01:04:11.594 --> 01:04:14.344
That's when the tragedy occurred.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:18.133
- [John Narrating] It
was more than a tragedy.

01:04:18.133 --> 01:04:20.139
It was a massacre

01:04:20.139 --> 01:04:24.306
of which the memory remains a
raw presence in modern China.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.380
- Why does the Chinese
state still fear the few?

01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:37.161
The few who speak out,
and I'm thinking of--

01:04:37.161 --> 01:04:38.999
- Liu Xiaobo? (laughs)

01:04:38.999 --> 01:04:40.562
- [John] Exactly.

01:04:40.562 --> 01:04:44.729
This man won the Nobel Peace
Prize and he's in prison.

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:50.078
- He violated Chinese law by a big margin.

01:04:50.078 --> 01:04:52.804
So actually the freedom of expression,

01:04:52.804 --> 01:04:55.999
similar views are aired by many people

01:04:55.999 --> 01:04:58.916
but he really going to the extreme.

01:05:00.878 --> 01:05:03.098
- [John Narrating] Liu Xiaobo
challenged the government

01:05:03.098 --> 01:05:05.851
to implement democratic reforms

01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:09.434
and he spent a total
of 13 years in prison.

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:14.761
- Why can't a confident China

01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:17.840
accept a criticism like that?

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.674
- Nobel peace committee
makes huge mistake.

01:05:20.674 --> 01:05:22.932
They owe the Chinese an explanation.

01:05:22.932 --> 01:05:26.531
If you cross a line, you
violate the constitution,

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:29.259
you violate so many laws,
you should be punished.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.842
(somber music)

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:37.047
- [John Narrating] And yet in China today,

01:05:37.047 --> 01:05:40.177
the spirit of protest and dissent

01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:42.510
lives on in different forms.

01:05:45.001 --> 01:05:48.251
In 2015, strikes and community protests

01:05:49.172 --> 01:05:51.922
and activism reach record levels.

01:05:53.175 --> 01:05:57.092
This resistance is seldom
reported in the West.

01:05:58.112 --> 01:06:01.541
- So there are lots of protests in China.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.479
Typical for example, land being grabbed by

01:06:03.479 --> 01:06:06.479
officials for commercial development

01:06:07.514 --> 01:06:10.221
and the farmers are not
being compensated properly.

01:06:10.221 --> 01:06:12.900
But the farmers now know,

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.128
are more aware of their
rights so they protest.

01:06:16.128 --> 01:06:17.752
Or young workers from the factory,

01:06:17.752 --> 01:06:21.609
they demand a better wage and
a better working condition,

01:06:21.609 --> 01:06:25.760
but many of the protests
they are economic driven,

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.112
not political driven.

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:29.422
They are regional, not nation-wide.

01:06:29.422 --> 01:06:31.075
So this kind of thing is unlikely

01:06:31.075 --> 01:06:33.229
to develop into real movement

01:06:33.229 --> 01:06:36.479
or so-called, you call that revolution.

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:38.737
- [John] So the Mao's revolution

01:06:38.737 --> 01:06:41.054
was the last revolution?

01:06:41.054 --> 01:06:45.221
- (laughs) Well, never say never.

01:06:51.909 --> 01:06:54.826
(helicopter whirs)

01:06:57.675 --> 01:07:00.277
- [John Narrating] The
Japanese island of Okinawa

01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:03.694
is occupied by 32 military installations.

01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:08.468
From here, the United
States has attacked Korea,

01:07:08.468 --> 01:07:11.551
Vietnam, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Iraq.

01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:18.262
The sky is full of planes and helicopters.

01:07:18.262 --> 01:07:21.179
(helicopter whirs)

01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:29.360
Wherever people go, they are fenced in

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.110
and told to keep out.

01:07:36.684 --> 01:07:41.095
Okinawa is the front
line of a beckoning war

01:07:41.095 --> 01:07:42.012
with China.

01:07:44.968 --> 01:07:47.801
(people shouting)

01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:52.599
Aged 87, Fumiko Shimabukuro

01:07:54.047 --> 01:07:57.089
is one of the leaders of
a non-violent resistance

01:07:57.089 --> 01:08:01.089
that's challenging
Washington's "Pivot to Asia."

01:08:13.913 --> 01:08:16.746
(people shouting)

01:09:01.908 --> 01:09:04.424
- [John Narrating] Fumiko is a survivor.

01:09:04.424 --> 01:09:06.947
A quarter of the civilians on the island

01:09:06.947 --> 01:09:10.613
were killed in the
American invasion in 1945

01:09:11.585 --> 01:09:15.752
and a fear of war has been
passed through the generations.

01:09:20.107 --> 01:09:22.689
(gentle music)

01:09:28.481 --> 01:09:31.309
Today, those who witnessed these horrors

01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:34.807
live in a place of extraordinary beauty

01:09:34.807 --> 01:09:38.974
surrounded by coral reefs
and a unique marine life.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:50.785
It was here in Henoko Bay

01:09:50.785 --> 01:09:55.395
that the survivors of
World War Two sought refuge

01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:58.978
and it's this they're
now fighting to save.

01:10:00.385 --> 01:10:03.926
It's an epic struggle that
pits these island people

01:10:03.926 --> 01:10:07.676
against the greatest
military power on Earth.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:18.269
- This is the office of a
former governor of Okinawa,

01:10:18.269 --> 01:10:19.352
Ota Masahide.

01:10:20.809 --> 01:10:24.476
What is done is create
not so much a museum,

01:10:25.573 --> 01:10:28.406
but an appeal to the outside world

01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:33.368
to understand the resistance in Okinawa,

01:10:33.368 --> 01:10:35.884
to understand the suffering,

01:10:35.884 --> 01:10:38.893
to read its hidden history.

01:10:38.893 --> 01:10:43.195
It begins in 1945 when
the Americans invaded.

01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:46.945
Here's General MacArthur
arriving in Okinawa.

01:10:49.824 --> 01:10:53.292
A second invasion happened 10 years later

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:54.469
in what became known as

01:10:54.469 --> 01:10:57.734
the Bulldozer's and Bayonets campaign.

01:10:57.734 --> 01:11:01.338
American forces seized
prime agricultural land,

01:11:01.338 --> 01:11:05.306
burned farm houses, and killed livestock.

01:11:05.306 --> 01:11:07.655
The dispossessed people of Okinawa

01:11:07.655 --> 01:11:11.488
march the length of
Japan, appealing for help.

01:11:13.628 --> 01:11:16.969
- This wall is devoted to
a resistance in Okinawa

01:11:16.969 --> 01:11:18.551
that never ceases.

01:11:18.551 --> 01:11:20.649
Everywhere people go on the island,

01:11:20.649 --> 01:11:23.482
they are confronted by this sign.

01:11:23.482 --> 01:11:26.106
It tells them they must not go past

01:11:26.106 --> 01:11:28.800
this fence topped with barbed wire.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.149
These fences run like great
ribbons across the island

01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:37.760
and the bases themselves
cut swaths across Okinawa.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.776
But all around them are people

01:11:39.776 --> 01:11:43.295
with this continuing demonstration,

01:11:43.295 --> 01:11:45.545
this continuing resistance.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:48.440
And they have a message.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.321
It's: "People of the World,

01:11:50.321 --> 01:11:53.150
"Watch what Japan and the US are doing.

01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:56.817
"Don't let them force
the bases on Okinawa."

01:12:53.649 --> 01:12:54.788
- [John Narrating] All this will be lost

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:55.993
when much of the bay becomes

01:12:55.993 --> 01:12:59.660
concrete runways for
bombers at Camp Schwab,

01:13:00.772 --> 01:13:04.272
the huge US Marine base behind this fence.

01:13:07.578 --> 01:13:09.636
(applause)

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:12.969
In 2014, Okinawa elected a new governor,

01:13:14.956 --> 01:13:19.123
Takeshi Onaga, who won by
a landslide on one issue.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.767
Stopping the new base at Henoko.

01:13:24.087 --> 01:13:27.615
This was election night
outside the American base

01:13:27.615 --> 01:13:28.865
at Camp Schwab.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.910
(cheering)

01:14:10.031 --> 01:14:13.031
♪ We shall overcome ♪

01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:17.777
♪ We shall overcome someday ♪

01:14:21.091 --> 01:14:24.341
♪ Oh, deep in my heart ♪

01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:28.566
♪ I do believe ♪

01:14:30.125 --> 01:14:33.792
♪ We shall overcome someday ♪

01:14:42.097 --> 01:14:44.898
The New Year's celebration
of their victory

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:47.024
was bittersweet.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.463
The government in Tokyo resented this

01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:52.880
unprecedented challenge to its authority.

01:14:54.188 --> 01:14:57.783
The issue is now in the Japanese courts.

01:14:57.783 --> 01:15:00.700
Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe,

01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:04.295
has also made clear that with the backing

01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:06.799
of his powerful patron America,

01:15:06.799 --> 01:15:10.640
he wants to reawaken Japanese nationalism

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.307
and reclaim it's military power.

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.887
(helicopter whirs)

01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:23.012
(drum pounds)

01:15:23.012 --> 01:15:25.179
(singing)

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:30.279
While we were filming this
ceremony outside the base,

01:15:30.279 --> 01:15:32.374
on a day when people paid respect

01:15:32.374 --> 01:15:35.335
to their departed loved ones,

01:15:35.335 --> 01:15:39.257
giant American helicopters
circled above us,

01:15:39.257 --> 01:15:41.174
intimidating as always.

01:15:52.953 --> 01:15:55.803
The threat of these low-flying aircraft

01:15:55.803 --> 01:15:59.292
is a constant presence in Okinawa.

01:15:59.292 --> 01:16:02.481
Teachers often can't
teach because of the noise

01:16:02.481 --> 01:16:03.564
and the fear.

01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:13.052
(somber music)

01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:15.842
This was the carnage
when an American fighter

01:16:15.842 --> 01:16:18.029
crashed into a primary school

01:16:18.029 --> 01:16:21.196
after the pilot had ejected to safety.

01:16:28.706 --> 01:16:32.373
Haru Akira, aged seven,
was terribly burned.

01:17:42.646 --> 01:17:44.558
Akira suffered throughout his youth

01:17:44.558 --> 01:17:47.391
and died from his injuries age 21.

01:17:54.357 --> 01:17:58.101
Another tragedy waits
to happen on Okinawa.

01:17:58.101 --> 01:18:01.226
US military aircraft have been involved

01:18:01.226 --> 01:18:03.726
in 44 accidents on the island.

01:18:05.003 --> 01:18:08.657
The latest threat is this
hybrid plane, the Osprey,

01:18:08.657 --> 01:18:11.324
notorious for its safety issues.

01:18:23.351 --> 01:18:25.851
(dance music)

01:18:30.002 --> 01:18:32.258
Wherever the military is based in Asia,

01:18:32.258 --> 01:18:35.161
there is a relationship with local people,

01:18:35.161 --> 01:18:39.078
especially women, that
often breeds resentment.

01:18:49.419 --> 01:18:53.586
In Okinawa, this resentment
ignited a riot in 1970.

01:18:55.094 --> 01:18:59.096
Scores of American GI's
were pulled from their cars

01:18:59.096 --> 01:19:00.929
which were set alight.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.089
For Washington and it's
compliant ally in Tokyo,

01:19:08.089 --> 01:19:11.922
it's this kind of
insurrection that they fear.

01:19:17.473 --> 01:19:19.762
During the making of this film,

01:19:19.762 --> 01:19:22.649
a young woman was raped and murdered,

01:19:22.649 --> 01:19:25.814
allegedly by an American
military contractor

01:19:25.814 --> 01:19:27.741
from one of the bases.

01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:29.991
(chanting)

01:19:32.636 --> 01:19:35.911
It was the latest of
thousands of cases of violence

01:19:35.911 --> 01:19:40.037
and it brought massive
crowds into the streets,

01:19:40.037 --> 01:19:41.150
demanding an end to the

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.233
military occupation of their country.

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.974
(aircraft rumbles)

01:19:52.974 --> 01:19:54.975
This is a Mace missile,

01:19:54.975 --> 01:19:58.683
designed to carry a nuclear warhead.

01:19:58.683 --> 01:20:01.558
During the Cold War, the United States

01:20:01.558 --> 01:20:04.101
secretly installed nuclear weapons

01:20:04.101 --> 01:20:06.601
at this launch pad in Okinawa.

01:20:08.908 --> 01:20:11.658
Most of them were aimed at China.

01:20:17.029 --> 01:20:19.580
Today, the nuclear missile site

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.231
is run by a Buddhist organization,

01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:25.148
the Soka Gakkai, as a peace museum.

01:20:26.748 --> 01:20:29.248
- In 1962, the atomic weapons,

01:20:31.214 --> 01:20:33.386
that were on the missile,

01:20:33.386 --> 01:20:35.053
was almost launched.

01:20:37.112 --> 01:20:38.302
- They were almost launched?

01:20:38.302 --> 01:20:42.808
- Yeah, according to the
spokesman of this military base,

01:20:42.808 --> 01:20:45.641
said they were ordered to prepare.

01:20:46.828 --> 01:20:50.245
Then we received second order to stop it.

01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:56.162
- [John Narrating] One of
the American servicemen

01:20:56.162 --> 01:20:57.995
whose job was to fire the Mace missiles

01:20:57.995 --> 01:21:01.663
has since revealed that
China was a nuclear target

01:21:01.663 --> 01:21:04.996
during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

01:21:07.116 --> 01:21:11.435
- We were told that we had
to launch all the missiles.

01:21:11.435 --> 01:21:14.284
But we only had one missile
headed towards Russia

01:21:14.284 --> 01:21:15.696
and we did not see why we

01:21:15.696 --> 01:21:18.291
should have to involve
the other countries.

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:23.167
The captain suggested that
everybody crack the doors open

01:21:23.167 --> 01:21:26.852
so it would take less
time to launch the missile

01:21:26.852 --> 01:21:29.572
if the doors were cracked open.

01:21:29.572 --> 01:21:31.739
(beeping)

01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:34.363
- [John Narrating] One of the launch crews

01:21:34.363 --> 01:21:37.373
was on the point of firing their missiles

01:21:37.373 --> 01:21:42.045
when a duty officer suspected
the order was false.

01:21:42.045 --> 01:21:43.554
- The officer that was on the B side

01:21:43.554 --> 01:21:47.006
was told to send two
men over there with 45's

01:21:47.006 --> 01:21:48.694
and to shoot anybody that tried to launch

01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:51.444
until the situation was resolved.

01:21:53.296 --> 01:21:56.100
And it would only take like 15, 20 seconds

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.998
to run the distance between
the two command centers.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:03.787
So those two men kept
that whole crew at bay

01:22:03.787 --> 01:22:07.037
while we made a decision as what to do.

01:22:10.457 --> 01:22:13.279
And it wasn't very long, maybe
two or three seconds later

01:22:13.279 --> 01:22:16.950
where a very nervous major
came over the intercom

01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:19.367
issuing the stand down order.

01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:26.758
And then we just kind of
looked at each other, like

01:22:27.925 --> 01:22:31.592
we could have exterminated
the whole planet.

01:22:34.441 --> 01:22:37.110
The major who had given the launch order

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:39.305
was quietly court-martialed

01:22:39.305 --> 01:22:42.055
and dismissed from the Air Force.

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.964
- That morning is just as familiar to me

01:22:45.964 --> 01:22:48.738
and as clear as yesterday morning is.

01:22:48.738 --> 01:22:50.886
And this is 53 years later

01:22:50.886 --> 01:22:53.306
and how clear blue the sky was

01:22:53.306 --> 01:22:56.361
and there was just some very light clouds

01:22:56.361 --> 01:22:58.713
and there was a perfect breeze blowing

01:22:58.713 --> 01:23:00.042
at the perfect temperature.

01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:01.435
I did not know what the temperature was,

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.635
but it just felt perfect.

01:23:03.635 --> 01:23:05.851
And we were all just kind of taking it in

01:23:05.851 --> 01:23:08.257
and taking in the smell of the air

01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:11.751
and the sea and the land mixture together

01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:14.947
and everything smelled so beautiful.

01:23:14.947 --> 01:23:18.674
- This is very interesting
because it shows

01:23:18.674 --> 01:23:22.841
the cities in China where these
Mace missiles were aimed at.

01:23:25.954 --> 01:23:28.204
Which ones do we have here?

01:23:29.067 --> 01:23:30.900
- This Okinawa Island.

01:23:31.959 --> 01:23:36.126
So within 2000 kilometers
you find Peking, or Beijing,

01:23:40.831 --> 01:23:44.081
Xi'an, Jiuzhaigou, Hong Kong, Shanghai,

01:23:45.657 --> 01:23:49.490
Taiwan and Taipei, and
Pyongyang, North Korea.

01:23:51.665 --> 01:23:53.998
Within the range of missile.

01:23:55.358 --> 01:23:58.275
(aircraft rumbles)

01:24:16.008 --> 01:24:18.591
(somber music)

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:32.609
- [John Narrating] This is the work of

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:35.609
the Okinawan sculptor, Kinjo Minoru.

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:40.664
It's a tribute to the
suffering and resistance

01:24:40.664 --> 01:24:43.081
of the people of this island.

01:25:07.593 --> 01:25:11.760
More than 1000 miles away on
the Korean island of Jeju,

01:25:12.898 --> 01:25:16.913
these symbols of struggle
are hauntingly similar.

01:25:16.913 --> 01:25:21.054
The work of Korean sculptor Koh Gil-chun,

01:25:21.054 --> 01:25:25.221
represents another fight of
island people for freedom.

01:25:26.445 --> 01:25:29.028
(gentle music)

01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:39.943
A semi-tropical sanctuary
of unusual beauty,

01:25:39.943 --> 01:25:43.398
Jeju Island is a world heritage site.

01:25:43.398 --> 01:25:46.761
The government of South Korea declared it

01:25:46.761 --> 01:25:48.844
an island of world peace.

01:25:55.898 --> 01:25:58.826
But on this island of peace has been built

01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:03.319
one of the most provocative
military bases in the world,

01:26:03.319 --> 01:26:06.152
less than 400 miles from Shanghai.

01:26:11.508 --> 01:26:14.601
Like Okinawa and the Marshall Islands,

01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:18.232
this is America's
frontline in it's so-called

01:26:18.232 --> 01:26:19.565
"Pivot to Asia."

01:26:22.532 --> 01:26:26.105
Here in once unspoiled Gangjeong Village,

01:26:26.105 --> 01:26:28.870
the South Korean Navy has built a base

01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:31.497
for American aircraft carriers,

01:26:31.497 --> 01:26:34.330
nuclear submarines, and destroyers

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.068
equipped with the Aegis ballistic missile

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:40.235
aimed at China's defenses.

01:26:44.817 --> 01:26:49.676
China's lifelines to the world
in oil, trade, resources,

01:26:49.676 --> 01:26:52.103
depend on shipping that comes through

01:26:52.103 --> 01:26:53.936
chokepoints like this.

01:26:56.365 --> 01:26:58.417
- The US pivot into the Asian-Pacific

01:26:58.417 --> 01:27:01.341
is really intended to create the ability

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:04.081
to put a loaded gun to the head of China

01:27:04.081 --> 01:27:06.823
and say, you will do as we say

01:27:06.823 --> 01:27:08.930
otherwise we will be able to restrict.

01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:11.474
We'll be able to shut down, choke off

01:27:11.474 --> 01:27:15.141
your importation of oil
and other resources.

01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:31.580
(chanting)

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.352
- [John Narrating] For
nine years, every day,

01:27:33.352 --> 01:27:36.010
often twice a day, these Catholic priests

01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:38.652
have staged a mass that blocked the gates

01:27:38.652 --> 01:27:42.128
of the new military base on Jeju Island.

01:27:42.128 --> 01:27:44.295
(singing)

01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:57.496
In a country where
political demonstrations

01:27:57.496 --> 01:28:01.897
can be easily banned,
unlike powerful religions,

01:28:01.897 --> 01:28:06.494
the tactic has produced this
spectacle of resistance.

01:28:06.494 --> 01:28:10.327
(man speaking on loudspeaker)

01:28:23.707 --> 01:28:26.596
(speaks foreign language)

01:28:26.596 --> 01:28:29.277
Father Mun Jeong-hyeon has led the fight

01:28:29.277 --> 01:28:31.610
to stop the base being built

01:28:34.364 --> 01:28:38.031
and several times
suffered serious injuries.

01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:51.877
(singing)

01:28:59.575 --> 01:29:02.332
- I sing four songs everyday.

01:29:02.332 --> 01:29:05.175
Before the Mass, during the
Mass, at the end of the Mass

01:29:05.175 --> 01:29:07.342
and the end of the rosary.

01:29:10.096 --> 01:29:13.690
The content of song is very beautiful.

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:16.940
The writer and composer is the musician

01:29:18.614 --> 01:29:20.031
from this island.

01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:24.734
I love him very much and
he gave me their song

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:28.234
which I practiced and I became a master

01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:32.384
to sing that song because I
practice everyday. (laughs)

01:29:32.384 --> 01:29:36.378
- [John] You sing it with such passion.

01:29:36.378 --> 01:29:38.545
(singing)

01:29:45.365 --> 01:29:46.767
- Sometimes we just wait.

01:29:46.767 --> 01:29:49.488
Typhoon, typhoon strike!

01:29:49.488 --> 01:29:50.763
- [John] Do you sing then?

01:29:50.763 --> 01:29:53.480
Do you have a Mass when
the typhoons strike?

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.313
- Oh yes.

01:29:56.038 --> 01:29:57.205
No exceptions.

01:29:59.474 --> 01:30:01.965
- [John] What will happen

01:30:01.965 --> 01:30:04.638
if this base becomes operational?

01:30:04.638 --> 01:30:07.041
- They have destroyed the environment,

01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:09.933
they destroy the life of all of us.

01:30:09.933 --> 01:30:14.100
We should be witness of their
oppression and violence.

01:30:15.682 --> 01:30:16.630
- [John] Why do they do it?

01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:21.276
- They'd like to rule the
Pacific area, the whole area.

01:30:21.276 --> 01:30:25.359
They'd like to make China
isolated in this globe.

01:30:27.276 --> 01:30:31.443
The US government want to
be in power of this world.

01:30:32.407 --> 01:30:34.490
(laughs)

01:30:37.175 --> 01:30:40.032
- [John Narrating] Meanwhile,
a Quaker called Mr. Oh

01:30:40.032 --> 01:30:43.491
joins them with his own ritual of protest,

01:30:43.491 --> 01:30:47.158
accompanied by an artist
called Wild Flower.

01:32:32.365 --> 01:32:34.361
- [John Narrating] This
is the center of an empire

01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:36.832
that never speaks its name,

01:32:36.832 --> 01:32:41.295
whose power is represented in
this extraordinary world map

01:32:41.295 --> 01:32:43.545
of American military bases.

01:32:48.599 --> 01:32:51.996
4000 bases in the United States,

01:32:51.996 --> 01:32:55.996
almost 1000 bases spread
across every continent.

01:32:59.994 --> 01:33:01.879
- The archipelago of empire,

01:33:01.879 --> 01:33:04.106
the bases that we have around the world

01:33:04.106 --> 01:33:08.273
hidden in plain sight are the
real territory of our empire

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:13.935
but at the same time we
maintain independent governments

01:33:13.935 --> 01:33:16.852
in Japan or South Korea or Germany.

01:33:18.165 --> 01:33:20.355
They don't have autonomy when
it comes to foreign policy.

01:33:20.355 --> 01:33:24.195
So it's a very sophisticated
and effective system

01:33:24.195 --> 01:33:27.504
whereby we pat ourselves on the back for

01:33:27.504 --> 01:33:30.587
helping to midwife democracy in Japan

01:33:31.538 --> 01:33:34.624
and Germany and South Korea
and various other places

01:33:34.624 --> 01:33:37.894
while keeping the lid
on in that we don't know

01:33:37.894 --> 01:33:39.723
what these countries would do if they were

01:33:39.723 --> 01:33:41.345
fully independent.

01:33:41.345 --> 01:33:43.079
And the beauty of this system is that

01:33:43.079 --> 01:33:46.249
most people pay no attention to it at all.

01:33:46.249 --> 01:33:47.744
They think it's just a natural occurrence

01:33:47.744 --> 01:33:51.216
to have 50,000 American troops in Japan.

01:33:51.216 --> 01:33:55.041
- There's no country that has
better anti-imperial credit--

01:33:55.041 --> 01:33:57.890
(laughs) cred, then the United States.

01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:59.055
And we are not trying to recreate

01:33:59.055 --> 01:34:01.888
the glories of the British Empire.

01:34:03.121 --> 01:34:05.687
We're arguing that the world is round.

01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:07.604
We have a global policy

01:34:09.138 --> 01:34:12.055
and all nations have global rights.

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:16.195
- No ocean has ever been dominated

01:34:16.195 --> 01:34:20.362
the way the US dominates the
Pacific, Navy and Air Force.

01:34:21.783 --> 01:34:25.264
They claim that in the
Pearl Harbor headquarters

01:34:25.264 --> 01:34:29.645
of the Pacific Command,
they claim to be responsible

01:34:29.645 --> 01:34:33.586
for 52 percent of the Earth's surface.

01:34:33.586 --> 01:34:36.412
And when you look at their logo,

01:34:36.412 --> 01:34:39.360
it shows an eagle over
the Aleutian Islands

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.056
with one tail coming down
somewhere near Seattle

01:34:42.056 --> 01:34:45.609
and the other coming
down right over Beijing.

01:34:45.609 --> 01:34:48.859
So Beijing looks at a network of bases,

01:34:50.646 --> 01:34:52.732
a real archipelago of empire

01:34:52.732 --> 01:34:55.396
that's been built up since the Korean War.

01:34:55.396 --> 01:34:58.073
- You have had and still have

01:34:58.073 --> 01:35:01.323
an arc of bases that start in Australia

01:35:02.569 --> 01:35:03.666
and go through the Pacific--

01:35:03.666 --> 01:35:04.535
- No.

01:35:04.535 --> 01:35:06.366
We have no bases in Australia.

01:35:06.366 --> 01:35:08.525
- You have Pine Gap, you have Darwin--

01:35:08.525 --> 01:35:09.618
- No.

01:35:09.618 --> 01:35:11.483
- And you have a new facility
in Western Australia.

01:35:11.483 --> 01:35:13.164
- No, to speak precisely,

01:35:13.164 --> 01:35:16.334
we have no military bases in Australia.

01:35:16.334 --> 01:35:20.501
What we do is is operate
with and in Australian bases.

01:35:23.949 --> 01:35:27.782
But we're not in the
basing business nowadays.

01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:34.419
- There's a growing collection
of what are referred to as

01:35:34.419 --> 01:35:35.752
"lilypad bases."

01:35:36.642 --> 01:35:40.873
These are bases that have
typically two, 300 troops,

01:35:40.873 --> 01:35:44.649
no family members, very few amenities,

01:35:44.649 --> 01:35:46.615
and they are often quite secretive.

01:35:46.615 --> 01:35:48.637
They are bases that are
frequently constructed

01:35:48.637 --> 01:35:52.205
within a foreign country's
base to disguise it

01:35:52.205 --> 01:35:56.279
and generally are not
referred to as bases.

01:35:56.279 --> 01:35:58.360
- [John Narrating] Many of
these bases have been set up

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.277
to combat China's worldwide
economic influence.

01:36:05.675 --> 01:36:10.489
From these bases, the United
States operates a secret army

01:36:10.489 --> 01:36:11.906
in 147 countries.

01:36:14.688 --> 01:36:16.114
- If you're gonna be a free country

01:36:16.114 --> 01:36:18.891
rather than give in to every
gangster regime in the world,

01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:20.717
you're gonna have to take a risk.

01:36:20.717 --> 01:36:23.497
'Cause the gangsters,
they want to eliminate

01:36:23.497 --> 01:36:26.751
good people in the world so they can--

01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:30.489
and in China, they want to
dominate all of the Far East,

01:36:30.489 --> 01:36:31.535
they want to dominate.

01:36:31.535 --> 01:36:34.454
Just like Japan wanted
to before World War Two.

01:36:34.454 --> 01:36:37.043
Their goal was to dominate
that part of the world.

01:36:37.043 --> 01:36:41.210
Today, because there's been no
political reform in Beijing,

01:36:42.097 --> 01:36:46.587
these guys want to dominate
a huge chunk of the planet.

01:36:46.587 --> 01:36:47.420
(mumbles)

01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.609
- [John Narrating] Andrew
Krepinevich served on

01:36:49.609 --> 01:36:52.143
America's National Defense Panel.

01:36:52.143 --> 01:36:56.189
He's a military strategist
and war planner.

01:36:56.189 --> 01:36:59.796
- You've written that
airstrikes and naval blockades

01:36:59.796 --> 01:37:03.046
have a role to play in punishing China.

01:37:04.995 --> 01:37:08.998
You've described the need for sea mines.

01:37:08.998 --> 01:37:11.626
You've described the
need for special forces,

01:37:11.626 --> 01:37:15.793
US Special Forces, and
missiles placed on islands.

01:37:17.062 --> 01:37:19.774
This sounds like a preparation for war.

01:37:19.774 --> 01:37:22.163
- Our first president, George Washington,

01:37:22.163 --> 01:37:25.180
said that if you want
peace, prepare for war.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:28.651
And essentially what the
United States is doing again

01:37:28.651 --> 01:37:32.818
is responding to provocative
behavior on the part of China.

01:37:33.677 --> 01:37:36.292
And just as we did in the Cold War,

01:37:36.292 --> 01:37:40.459
the idea was to have a
position of military strength

01:37:41.983 --> 01:37:43.875
such that your adversaries
were not tempted

01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:46.505
to act in aggressive ways or

01:37:46.505 --> 01:37:49.072
try and employ coercion to get their way.

01:37:49.072 --> 01:37:53.590
- Just last week the US Navy
sent a guided missile destroyer

01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:57.423
into the Spratly Islands,
the South China Sea.

01:37:59.176 --> 01:38:02.136
And what was different
about this, I think,

01:38:02.136 --> 01:38:05.682
was that Chinese fighters scrambled.

01:38:05.682 --> 01:38:08.345
That sounds like an escalator.

01:38:08.345 --> 01:38:10.928
- Well again, from an
American prospective,

01:38:10.928 --> 01:38:12.923
the escalation was that the Chinese

01:38:12.923 --> 01:38:16.166
beginning to militarize these
islands in the first place,

01:38:16.166 --> 01:38:20.392
moving its military capabilities
down into that region,

01:38:20.392 --> 01:38:22.304
engaging in provocative behavior against

01:38:22.304 --> 01:38:26.304
the commercial activities
and military forces of

01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:29.137
other minor countries in the region

01:38:29.137 --> 01:38:31.240
that have claim to those islands.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:34.864
So it's a response to
Chinese intimidation rather--

01:38:34.864 --> 01:38:38.701
- Excuse me, how is
commerce being intimidated

01:38:38.701 --> 01:38:40.839
in the South China Sea?

01:38:40.839 --> 01:38:42.529
- There have been no military forces,

01:38:42.529 --> 01:38:44.096
no military bases there.

01:38:44.096 --> 01:38:45.214
The Chinese--

01:38:45.214 --> 01:38:47.346
- Except the United States military base.

01:38:47.346 --> 01:38:48.600
- Not in the South China Sea.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.209
Not even in the Philippines because

01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:52.678
the United States withdrew
its forces in the Philippines.

01:38:52.678 --> 01:38:55.508
- But the United States is
back in the Philippines.

01:38:55.508 --> 01:38:57.771
- The Philippines and the
United States have announced

01:38:57.771 --> 01:39:00.557
five different locations
scattered all throughout

01:39:00.557 --> 01:39:02.497
the Philippines where US troops will

01:39:02.497 --> 01:39:06.140
be stationed on a rotational basis.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.633
- [John Narrating] This
threat to China from yet more

01:39:08.633 --> 01:39:12.789
US bases on its doorstep was not an issue

01:39:12.789 --> 01:39:17.036
when an arbitration tribunal
ruled against China's claims

01:39:17.036 --> 01:39:21.203
to the strategic Spratly
Islands in the South China Sea.

01:39:23.168 --> 01:39:26.585
In 2015, the US Navy rehearsed a blockade

01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:30.965
that would cut China's lifelines of oil

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:33.298
and trade and raw materials.

01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:38.379
The danger of confrontation
grows by the day.

01:39:40.762 --> 01:39:43.932
- The US Navy is on the doorstep of China

01:39:43.932 --> 01:39:46.485
regardless of disputed islands

01:39:46.485 --> 01:39:49.853
and is there with low-draft ships,

01:39:49.853 --> 01:39:51.686
planes, battle groups.

01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:54.949
It's right on the doorsteps.

01:39:54.949 --> 01:39:56.281
What of Chinese ships?

01:39:56.281 --> 01:40:00.265
What if the equivalent was off California?

01:40:00.265 --> 01:40:04.224
- Well John, we ask ourselves
that question regularly.

01:40:04.224 --> 01:40:08.391
And it's important to put
yourself in the other guy's shoes.

01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:10.785
So look.

01:40:10.785 --> 01:40:14.452
We don't operate in the
Pacific in an effort

01:40:16.399 --> 01:40:21.133
to scare China, to contain
China, to backfoot China.

01:40:21.133 --> 01:40:24.505
Our operations and our presence,

01:40:24.505 --> 01:40:28.822
first of all, is warmly
welcomed by the vast majority

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:32.068
of the coastal states, but secondly,

01:40:32.068 --> 01:40:34.627
is fully accepted by the Chinese.

01:40:34.627 --> 01:40:35.914
Time after time--

01:40:35.914 --> 01:40:38.887
- Excuse me, is it fully accepted?

01:40:38.887 --> 01:40:41.309
- Yes, by their words.

01:40:41.309 --> 01:40:42.676
The Chinese leaders--

01:40:42.676 --> 01:40:46.436
- [John] My impression
is that they're scared.

01:40:46.436 --> 01:40:49.487
- [John Narrating] And this
is what they're scared of.

01:40:49.487 --> 01:40:52.487
A noose of bases right around China.

01:40:57.305 --> 01:41:00.305
Missiles, bombers, drones, warships.

01:41:02.355 --> 01:41:04.105
A provocation of war.

01:41:07.343 --> 01:41:11.910
- Today, I state clearly
and with conviction.

01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:15.417
America's commitment to
seek the peace and security

01:41:15.417 --> 01:41:17.896
of a world without nuclear weapons.

01:41:17.896 --> 01:41:20.146
(cheering)

01:41:21.634 --> 01:41:23.311
- [John Narrating] Under Obama,

01:41:23.311 --> 01:41:25.542
nuclear warhead spending has risen higher

01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:30.425
than under any president
since the end of the Cold War.

01:41:30.425 --> 01:41:33.074
- It's all a magician's show because

01:41:33.074 --> 01:41:36.418
at the same time that Obama
is talking about that,

01:41:36.418 --> 01:41:38.447
not only is he spending a trillion dollars

01:41:38.447 --> 01:41:41.184
to modernize US nuclear forces,

01:41:41.184 --> 01:41:43.454
but he's deploying these
missile defense systems

01:41:43.454 --> 01:41:45.385
to encircle Russia and China,

01:41:45.385 --> 01:41:47.701
which makes it impossible to

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:50.337
get rid of nuclear
weapons in that climate.

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:53.391
- Everybody wants to
look like they're tough.

01:41:53.391 --> 01:41:54.770
See, I gotta be tough.

01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:57.581
I'm not afraid of doing anything military.

01:41:57.581 --> 01:41:58.883
I'm not afraid of threatening.

01:41:58.883 --> 01:42:01.340
I'm a hairy-chested gorilla.

01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:05.040
And you don't want to
look like you're weak,

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.207
so what you do is you talk
more and more aggressively

01:42:10.622 --> 01:42:13.596
and if you don't want to do it yourself,

01:42:13.596 --> 01:42:17.476
because you maybe think it
doesn't look very presidential,

01:42:17.476 --> 01:42:20.976
you let somebody under you do the talking.

01:42:23.959 --> 01:42:25.703
And the United States has
gotten into a situation

01:42:25.703 --> 01:42:29.536
where there's a lot of
military saber-rattling

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:34.708
and it's really being
orchestrated from the top.

01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:38.875
- Yeah, that seems incredibly
dangerous, all of this.

01:42:39.886 --> 01:42:43.523
- That's an understatement,
I think, but I agree.

01:42:43.523 --> 01:42:45.923
- When you routinely plan for mass murder,

01:42:45.923 --> 01:42:47.697
you become conditioned to it.

01:42:47.697 --> 01:42:49.052
That's what this is.

01:42:49.052 --> 01:42:50.155
We accept it.

01:42:50.155 --> 01:42:51.993
Oh yeah, we have nuclear weapons.

01:42:51.993 --> 01:42:54.761
- The Defense Secretary has just announced

01:42:54.761 --> 01:42:58.604
that there will be
warships and special forces

01:42:58.604 --> 01:43:01.391
and planes sent to the Philippines

01:43:01.391 --> 01:43:04.292
and the Wall Street Journal
has described this as

01:43:04.292 --> 01:43:08.459
"the vanguard of a major US
presence in Southeast Asia."

01:43:10.496 --> 01:43:11.329
That sounds like--

01:43:11.329 --> 01:43:13.240
- Where does this end?

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.669
What's the purpose?

01:43:14.669 --> 01:43:17.163
I mean, where are we
going to stop this process

01:43:17.163 --> 01:43:19.771
before it starts a war?

01:43:19.771 --> 01:43:22.240
And then if the war starts,
where does that end?

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.157
♪ America, America ♪

01:43:29.274 --> 01:43:32.857
♪ God shed his grace on me ♪

01:43:37.501 --> 01:43:41.668
♪ And crown thy good with brotherhood ♪

01:43:45.405 --> 01:43:48.905
♪ From sea to shining sea ♪

01:43:58.248 --> 01:44:00.665
(wind howls)

01:44:07.889 --> 01:44:10.497
The scientific studies that
I teach by the scientists

01:44:10.497 --> 01:44:12.397
that predict that the Earth can be made

01:44:12.397 --> 01:44:14.662
essentially uninhabitable
from nuclear war,

01:44:14.662 --> 01:44:17.224
the scientists have been begging
the Obama administration--

01:44:17.224 --> 01:44:18.623
well, they wouldn't say begging.

01:44:18.623 --> 01:44:20.410
But they have made multiple requests

01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:22.304
to meet with them and
discuss these predictions

01:44:22.304 --> 01:44:23.508
because they're peer-reviewed studies

01:44:23.508 --> 01:44:26.441
and they've been turned
down over and over again.

01:44:26.441 --> 01:44:27.989
They've been peripherally told that,

01:44:27.989 --> 01:44:30.295
well we don't think the long-term

01:44:30.295 --> 01:44:32.489
environmental consequences of nuclear war

01:44:32.489 --> 01:44:33.945
are all that important
if the immediate effects

01:44:33.945 --> 01:44:36.303
of nuclear war don't stop it.

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:38.722
That the long-term environmental
consequences of nuclear war

01:44:38.722 --> 01:44:41.979
are liable to wipe out the human race.

01:44:41.979 --> 01:44:43.555
- [John] In one exchange,

01:44:43.555 --> 01:44:47.661
nuclear exchange between the US and China,

01:44:47.661 --> 01:44:50.244
what could be the consequences?

01:44:51.179 --> 01:44:52.501
- Well let me just give you an example

01:44:52.501 --> 01:44:55.350
of what one Chinese four
or five megaton warhead

01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:59.895
would do to a city in the
United States if it got through.

01:44:59.895 --> 01:45:02.273
The detonation of that weapon over a city

01:45:02.273 --> 01:45:03.973
would instantly ignite about

01:45:03.973 --> 01:45:06.640
six or 700 square miles on fire.

01:45:07.735 --> 01:45:09.703
And within 20 to 30 minutes,

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.134
all of those fires would coalesce

01:45:11.134 --> 01:45:13.472
into a single gigantic firestorm.

01:45:13.472 --> 01:45:14.686
There would be no escape from it.

01:45:14.686 --> 01:45:17.170
So all the people there would perish.

01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:18.458
So the US, with say,

01:45:18.458 --> 01:45:22.835
hundreds of nuclear
weapons on Chinese cities.

01:45:22.835 --> 01:45:25.335
When you combine all the smoke

01:45:26.313 --> 01:45:27.718
from these nuclear weapons detonating,

01:45:27.718 --> 01:45:30.239
it actually creates
millions of tons of smoke.

01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:33.629
Black carbon smoke that'll
rise above cloud level

01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:35.814
into the stratosphere,
it's heated by the sun,

01:45:35.814 --> 01:45:37.557
it acts like a solar collector.

01:45:37.557 --> 01:45:38.951
And that smoke, because of that,

01:45:38.951 --> 01:45:42.138
will stay there for 10 years or longer.

01:45:42.138 --> 01:45:43.607
And what the smoke does is it blocks

01:45:43.607 --> 01:45:46.917
warming sunlight from reaching
the surface of the earth

01:45:46.917 --> 01:45:50.211
and it becomes so cold in a
matter of just a couple of weeks

01:45:50.211 --> 01:45:52.877
that the temperature
will fall below freezing

01:45:52.877 --> 01:45:55.627
every day for one to three years.

01:45:58.117 --> 01:46:00.461
And it will become too
cold to grow food crops

01:46:00.461 --> 01:46:02.967
for at least 10 years or longer.

01:46:02.967 --> 01:46:05.384
(wind howls)

01:46:13.248 --> 01:46:15.145
- I mean, there's a total disconnect

01:46:15.145 --> 01:46:16.896
with the changing world.

01:46:16.896 --> 01:46:21.417
You have a giant rising
power, in this case, China.

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:23.419
Why would you expect a giant rising power

01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:26.756
to not want to have more
control over its destiny?

01:46:26.756 --> 01:46:28.298
What we should be doing in my view

01:46:28.298 --> 01:46:32.465
is trying to cultivate a sense
of friendship and cooperation

01:46:33.493 --> 01:46:35.495
and we can have our differences with them.

01:46:35.495 --> 01:46:36.825
If we think they're
doing something in trade

01:46:36.825 --> 01:46:39.987
that we don't like, let's
have it out with them.

01:46:39.987 --> 01:46:41.403
But this saber-rattling is

01:46:41.403 --> 01:46:43.321
the worst thing we can possibly do.

01:46:43.321 --> 01:46:45.571
(cheering)

01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:51.770
- It is time to show the whole world

01:46:53.481 --> 01:46:55.506
that America is back.

01:46:55.506 --> 01:46:59.673
Bigger, and better, and
stronger than ever before.

01:47:02.283 --> 01:47:04.950
We don't have victories anymore.

01:47:06.081 --> 01:47:08.507
We used to have victories,
but we don't have 'em.

01:47:08.507 --> 01:47:12.340
When was the last time
anybody saw us beating,

01:47:13.417 --> 01:47:14.750
let's say China?

01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:18.917
In a trade deal, they kill us.

01:47:18.917 --> 01:47:21.940
We can't continue to allow China

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:24.683
to rape our country, and
that's what they're doing.

01:47:24.683 --> 01:47:28.623
It's the greatest theft in
the history of the world.

01:47:28.623 --> 01:47:32.278
(audience cheers)

01:47:32.278 --> 01:47:34.571
- [John Narrating] The new
president, Donald Trump,

01:47:34.571 --> 01:47:36.654
has a problem with China.

01:47:37.903 --> 01:47:39.875
The urgent question now is,

01:47:39.875 --> 01:47:43.075
will Trump continue with the provocations

01:47:43.075 --> 01:47:47.242
revealed in this film and take
us all to the edge of war?

01:47:50.907 --> 01:47:54.171
- There never have been two countries

01:47:54.171 --> 01:47:56.404
more interdependent on each other

01:47:56.404 --> 01:47:59.154
than China and the US in history.

01:48:01.046 --> 01:48:02.795
And China is the largest trading nation

01:48:02.795 --> 01:48:05.219
in the world and in history.

01:48:05.219 --> 01:48:08.827
So China's economy and their
societies, their lives,

01:48:08.827 --> 01:48:11.410
are linked to the entire world.

01:48:12.736 --> 01:48:15.365
Including America and the West
and all the other countries.

01:48:15.365 --> 01:48:17.858
So I think interdependence
between these two countries

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:21.585
and among all the nations of the world,

01:48:21.585 --> 01:48:23.547
speak to peace.

01:48:23.547 --> 01:48:26.130
(gentle music)

01:48:54.524 --> 01:48:56.422
- [John Narrating] We don't
have to accept the word

01:48:56.422 --> 01:49:00.163
of those who conjure up
threats and false enemies

01:49:00.163 --> 01:49:03.580
to justify the business and profit of war

01:49:04.645 --> 01:49:08.514
if we recognize there
is another superpower,

01:49:08.514 --> 01:49:10.424
and that's us.

01:49:10.424 --> 01:49:14.340
Ordinary people everywhere,
like the people of Okinawa,

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:17.492
Jeju Island, the Marshall Islands,

01:49:17.492 --> 01:49:19.575
China, the United States.

01:49:20.764 --> 01:49:24.931
By speaking out, they deliver
a warning to all of us.

01:49:26.551 --> 01:49:29.384
