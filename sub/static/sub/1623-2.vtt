00:01.043 --> 00:02.533
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.456
- I'm not gonna hurt you, Dr Railly.
- How do you know my name?

00:05.589 --> 00:07.295
Pull in here. Pull the car over!

00:07.424 --> 00:11.337
They sent me back too early.
This is the past. 2043 is the present.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.837
Most of the human race is gonna be
wiped out because of a man named...

00:14.973 --> 00:16.804
- Leland Goines.
- We find him, I kill him.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.845
How will you know
if the future has changed?

00:18.977 --> 00:20.057
I'll be erased.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.303
He's dead, but you're still here.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.395
How is that possible?!

00:25.108 --> 00:27.941
Killing him didn't change anything.
There were others.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.106
Others? Others who?

00:30.239 --> 00:31.820
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

00:31.949 --> 00:35.862
Jennifer, your father is dead. He always
wanted you to carry on his work.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.031
(CHUCKLES)

00:54.137 --> 00:57.265
My name is Dr Cassandra Railly
of the... (STATIC)

00:57.391 --> 01:03.637
We 're working on containment of the...
The plague starts with Leland Frost.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.976
The true architects of the plague...

01:07.109 --> 01:10.727
There. Right there. Filter.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.817
(GARBLED SPEECH)

01:16.535 --> 01:18.617
...Monkey... Army of the 12 Monkeys.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.448
It has always been there.

01:32.801 --> 01:37.716
Here, look. This symbol appeared
in a mental institution in 2015.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.837
It's not far.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.841
Let's send Mr Cole and Mr Ramse
to investigate.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.607
Hey. Hey.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.734
Scavenger camp.

01:53.864 --> 01:57.857
We should take positions here
and we just wait 'em out.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.068
That camp looks cold.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.413
You don't know that.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.749
We could be here all night.
Then we're humping back in daylight.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.460
Listen, we get ambushed,
we don't make it back at all.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.672
It's a fair point.
You stay here, wait 'em out.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.882
Cole. Cole.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.089
Asshole.

03:02.974 --> 03:07.809
Doesn't make any sense. The recording
said Leland caused the plague.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.647
No, it says it started with Leland.
It's not the same thing.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.266
- You sure he's dead?
- Pretty sure, Ramse.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.893
I had him point-blank.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.691
Maybe you missed him.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.616
I didn't miss.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.827
Hey.

03:27.124 --> 03:32.335
You're not seriously considering
going back there? Huh?

03:33.797 --> 03:35.958
Jones said this was one and done.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.833
I guess Jones was wrong.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.550
The file on 248's missing.
It's the only one that's gone.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.550
(CLATTERING)

03:47.686 --> 03:50.302
- Shit. Scavs.
- What'd | tell you?

03:51.982 --> 03:54.268
(YELLS)

04:17.716 --> 04:20.332
- You never listen, huh?
- Look out!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.050
I didn't miss.

04:41.698 --> 04:46.408
My friend, you are not the same man
since you got back.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.369
- You're bringing me down.
- What are you talking about?

04:49.498 --> 04:51.409
I'm telling you, you're different.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.375
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.918
Listen, | get it, OK?
You're a little sad about being back.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.756
Who wouldn't be?

05:01.885 --> 05:06.254
I mean, you got the food,
you got the sights, the girl.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.220
It's not like that, man.

05:08.350 --> 05:13.390
Just remember, you're not from there.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.013
You're from here.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.310
We do what we have to.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.820
No viral mutations detected.
Welcome back, gentlemen.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.701
So about the girl...

05:31.998 --> 05:34.080
- Her name's Cassie.
- Cassie.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.993
- Are you gonna see her again?
- I don't know.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.045
CASSIE: It's me.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.717
Look, I know you have a lot
of questions, but I need your help.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.182
I'm at a gas station off 68
in Cumberland.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.684
Thank you for coming.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.738
You could have told me to go to hell.
Nobody would blame you.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.785
I didn't have anyone else to call.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.373
It's this one. Take this exit.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.419
- I thought you were out of town.
- I'm not going home.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.848
Where are we?

06:34.561 --> 06:38.850
My grandparents' old store,
the one they opened when Pop retired.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.145
Right. And why?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.438
It's listed
under my mother's maiden name.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.655
I don't have...
I need to lay low for a little while.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.069
Listen to yourself.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.784
You gotta lay low?

06:54.748 --> 06:58.866
There it is.
The "she's gone batshit" look.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.665
What are you doing with this guy?
He kidnapped you.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.961
He filled your head with this plague
stuff. Now he tries to kill someone.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.506
- Cassie, just talk to me.
- You want answers?

07:10.639 --> 07:12.755
I want to help you.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.560
Then ask DC Metro why the cops released
us to Markridge's private security.

07:18.688 --> 07:23.148
Ask 'em why there were no charges, why
we never even made it to the station.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.359
Then I'll tell you all about Cole.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.322
JONES: The symbol appeared
in Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.191
New York, Berlin,

07:33.328 --> 07:37.788
all major cities where the plague
had the highest rate of infection.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.157
(SIGHS)

07:40.293 --> 07:42.534
There's a pattern here, a design.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.792
It's aimed at making the virus
hit with maximum impact.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.884
If there was a guiding hand, they made
sure to infiltrate centers of power:

07:51.012 --> 07:52.673
police, government, health.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.173
You think this guiding hand
was the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.808
Who are they?

07:58.937 --> 08:02.680
A terrorist organization,
religious fanatics. Still unclear.

08:02.816 --> 08:07.731
So what now?
Back to 1987 to see this asshole again?

08:07.862 --> 08:11.400
We don't have enough power
to send you back that far, not yet.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.858
So where am I going?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.782
I'm sending you to 2015.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.077
I want you to track down
the patient in room 248.

08:21.209 --> 08:25.043
She's somehow connected to this
organization. Find out who they are.

08:29.467 --> 08:36.134
This... mental hospital.
Dr Railly could help me get inside.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.882
No. She is no longer
part of your mission.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.227
It was never my intention
that you made her your accomplice.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.731
You weren't there.

08:46.651 --> 08:50.564
No, but you could have
corrupted her timeline

08:50.697 --> 08:52.858
and prevented her
from leaving the message

08:52.991 --> 08:55.448
which starts our entire investigation.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.572
Time is cruel, Mr Cole.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.744
We are risking everything
by toying with it, taunting it.

09:02.876 --> 09:07.245
Believe me, I've learned
enough about time to fear it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.964
And so should you.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.681
- Are you ready to feed the beast?
- Oh, yeah.

09:31.488 --> 09:35.731
- Mr Ramse, you can't go in there!
- Lasky, shut your mouth!

09:38.703 --> 09:41.786
All right, I want you to have fun
back there this time, OK?

09:41.915 --> 09:45.908
I don't want you to get shot.
I want you to get laid, OK?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.000
Find some vintage.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.505
- Vintage?
- Yes.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.293
What was your mother's name again?
Roberta, right?

09:52.425 --> 09:56.043
- That is some cold shit, brother.
- Brier Street, Philly, right?

09:56.179 --> 09:59.467
- You're not being nice to me.
- She was pretty, right?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.557
Let me ask you, are you my father?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.471
JONES: Mr Ramse, if you please.

10:08.983 --> 10:14.444
Mr Cole, we're splintering you
to Philadelphia, 2015.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.815
You sure? You were off last trip
by weeks. You got it this time?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.319
Right on the money.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.746
Initiate splinter sequence.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.854
(COUGHS)

10:50.984 --> 10:53.066

11:14.382 --> 11:16.213
You gotta be shitting me.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.846
All right, OK.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.766
(SHOUTING IN KOREAN)

11:30.899 --> 11:34.983
I can't understand you!
Where... Where am I?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.897
(ALARM BLARES)

11:37.030 --> 11:39.191
What's going on?

11:40.033 --> 11:43.196
Coordinates were off.
He's in the wrong place and time.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.247
Have you got his tracer signal?
Prepare for long-range splinter.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.582
- We'll slingshot him.
- Where'd you send him?

11:59.886 --> 12:00.921
How's it going?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.558
You are American.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.146
No.

12:13.274 --> 12:17.267
This is very good... for me.

12:17.946 --> 12:22.110
For you... it is not good.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.826
OK, look, this is a misunderstanding.
I... I...

12:26.579 --> 12:29.946
Do you guys have any idea
what you're doing?

12:30.083 --> 12:34.827
Mr Ramse, listen to me. Mr Cole's name
was on a recording made 30 years ago.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.954
Fate gave your friend this mission.

12:37.090 --> 12:41.333
You, Mr Ramse, are here
only because he insists on it.

12:41.469 --> 12:45.428
Do you understand the difference?
Your future is not preordained.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.674
- Come on, let's go.
- You get him back, OK?

12:49.811 --> 12:52.598
- Get him back!
- Coordinates reset for 2015.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.345
Initiate slingshot!

13:12.250 --> 13:14.332
(YELLING)

13:23.845 --> 13:27.133
Assaulted two police officers,
spent three nights in county.

13:27.265 --> 13:32.225
Consistent signs of mental instability,
spitting, clawing, violent outbursts.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.390
No ID. No next of kin. Terrific.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.890
You've no previous history
of psychiatric treatment?

13:39.027 --> 13:41.689
There was no previous doctor?

13:42.572 --> 13:46.485
Were you military? County says
you have a number of bullet wounds.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.236
The attack on the police
and your episodes in the county jail

13:51.372 --> 13:53.363
suggest a pattern of violent behavior.

13:53.499 --> 13:57.208
Intermittent explosive disorder
related to PTSD.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.873
What does that mean?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.496
Your aggression
is likely related to past trauma.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.419
County requires a 48-hour stay
for observation.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.339
- MAN ON TV: Hello.
- GIRL ON TV: Who are you?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.214
An angel.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.935
- What's your name?
- Satan.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.895
Uh-oh.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.312
- MAN: What's the matter?
- BOY: Nothing.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.436
Only it's sure a sorry name
for an angel.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.569
- CHILDREN: Oh, wow.
- MAN: Please, come in.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.783
GIRL: You shouldn't.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.494
CASSIE:
I've already left you several messages.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.080
I just can't find
anything about it anywhere.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.201
I don't know what it is.
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.749
It's something Goines said.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.714
I just wanna know
if it means anything to you at all.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.424
I'm going to keep calling you
until you call me back,

14:47.553 --> 14:50.545
so, please, Jeremy, please call me back.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.468
Tough news in the biotech market today.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.638
Markridge Group CEO Leland Goines
has died.

14:56.771 --> 15:00.263
Goines suffered a massive heart attack
at his home in Virginia.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.938
Markridge is one of the leading
pioneers in vaccination research.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.779
A spokesman for the company
has requested privacy for the family

15:07.907 --> 15:10.193
as they deal with this tragic loss.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.657
Media giant, TRW...

15:18.251 --> 15:20.333
Screw this.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.519
NURSE: Goines? Jennifer?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.778
Jennifer, open up. Open up.

15:58.124 --> 16:02.163
Ticky-tock. Those eyes left, right,
swaying like a granddaddy clock.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.088
Soulful otter eyes.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.800
Can't keep them off me.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.796
Goines.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.767
You're Leland's daughter.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.637
Yes and no.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.731
I am a Goines. I was a daughter.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.102
(WHISPERS) Daddy's feeding the worms.

16:29.864 --> 16:30.979
Did you know Dad?

16:32.366 --> 16:33.401
We met.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.196
Sorry for your loss.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.320
(LAUGHS)

16:38.456 --> 16:40.538
(COUGHS)

16:43.169 --> 16:45.831
Reds and blues. Primary.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.420
Give me yellow!
I could paint you the world.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.424
I love colors.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.634
What about numbers?

16:54.847 --> 16:58.339
I love numbers, especially primaries.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.343
What about the number 12?

17:03.648 --> 17:08.233
12's not primary. You're not as smart as
me, are you? It's OK. It happens a lot.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.818
Hey, hey, hey.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.029
Maybe you could teach me.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.781
OK. I could do that.
What do you wanna learn?

17:20.706 --> 17:24.244
I want you to tell me
about the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.709
Monkeys?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.426
Tell me what you know. Who are they?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.172
Who? What? Where? When? What?

17:39.308 --> 17:42.425

He shouldn't have been talking to you.

He called it the Night Room.

It's an off-site lab with his teeny,
tiny little secret locked inside.

find it, the one that got away.

I was looking for that.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.638
In my time.

36:33.024 --> 36:36.016
CASSIE:
This is her first intake statement.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.734
It's a confession
about the murders at Markridge.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.155
She kept saying, "One got away."

36:42.283 --> 36:43.989
Yeah, she said that to me too.

36:46.413 --> 36:49.655
What if she was talking
about another scientist,

36:49.791 --> 36:52.282
someone else who worked in the lab?

36:52.419 --> 36:54.910
Someone the 12 Monkeys never found.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.798
If we found them,
we could get to the Night Room first.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.463
We?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.425
We.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.184
Time to go.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.983
See you soon.

37:28.455 --> 37:31.322
So Ms Goines is in the hands
of the Army of the 12 Monkeys?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.039
Yes.

37:33.168 --> 37:36.626
Yes, we've been over this, and the man
with the scar knew my name.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.915
I have no idea how.

37:38.047 --> 37:42.711
And I explained to you,
you're experiencing time out of order.

37:42.844 --> 37:47.008
He has encountered you before
in his past, your future.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.801
Now we know what to look for.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.845
The Night Room
and the one that got away.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.060
- Whatever you say.
- We are not finished.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.929
- Yes, we are.
- Mr Cole...

37:56.065 --> 37:58.681
Give it a rest.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.023
I'm holding a sign-in sheet
from the mental institution.

38:03.156 --> 38:06.523
There's a signature here.
Dr Cassandra Railly.

38:06.659 --> 38:11.870
I gave you explicit orders
not to get her involved.

38:11.998 --> 38:16.367
Let's get something straight.
You do not give me orders.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.292
Clear the room.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.303
I'm not your soldier.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.683
Tell me, Mr Cole, what are you, then?

38:44.155 --> 38:47.647
What would you be
had I not given you this mission?

38:48.952 --> 38:53.662
A scavenger
wandering the wastelands for scraps?

38:53.790 --> 38:56.076
This must be so frustrating for you.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.709
You're stuck here, I get to go back,

39:00.839 --> 39:03.125
and there's nothing you can do about it.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.670
(CHUCKLES)

39:05.802 --> 39:08.418
Oh, Mr Cole.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.424
I can show you what nothing is.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.097
You could, but you won't.

39:16.229 --> 39:19.687
You are endangering our chance
to save seven bill...

39:19.816 --> 39:23.559
Seven billion souls.
I know. I've heard it.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.317
(JONES SIGHS)

39:31.911 --> 39:34.573
I was 37 years old when the world died.

39:37.792 --> 39:41.376
I remember them, those seven billion.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.414
Not you. You were just a child.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.714
All you remember
is what you did out there.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.802
And that's the soul
that you want to save.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.478
Just that one soul.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.522
We had a one-shot deal.

40:08.072 --> 40:12.236
I go back in time, I kill a man for you

40:12.368 --> 40:15.235
and it's all over for me, I get erased.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.579
I'm not supposed to be here any more.

40:25.798 --> 40:26.833
None of us are.

40:30.011 --> 40:37.634
Look, Mr Cole, you and I...
we want the same thing,

40:37.769 --> 40:40.306
to change this reality.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.141
But that won't happen
if we don't trust each other.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.144
Then you need to trust me.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.362
Back there, I need her.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.898
I can't do this alone.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.044
All right.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.386
COLE: Who the hell are they?

41:19.227 --> 41:21.309
I don't know.

42:12.697 --> 42:13.857
Am I dying now?

42:13.990 --> 42:16.276
No, not today, Jennifer.
