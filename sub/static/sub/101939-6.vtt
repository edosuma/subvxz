11:44.078 --> 11:45.663
Yeah, all right. Forget it.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.915
Hey, kid, relax.
We're just breaking balls.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.543
Look, I get it.
I used to be the new guy around here.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.962
You're trying to take initiative,
get noticed.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.922
All right, here's what you need to do.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.758
Every Wednesday, someone
has to rotate the cars in the showroom,

11:57.842 --> 11:59.009
keep the inventory fresh.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.221
Now, you see that Porsche 911 over there?
It's a beaut, right?

12:02.763 --> 12:05.516
Well, the boss has been wanting
to move it up front by the windows.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.059
Think you can handle that?

12:08.018 --> 12:09.687
Sure. Yeah, I can do it.

12:11.021 --> 12:11.856
OK.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.324
[school bell chimes]

12:23.159 --> 12:25.244
[students laughing]

12:29.331 --> 12:32.084
Thanks for the Blow Pop, guys.
Really never gets old.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.045
It's 'cause she gives blow jobs.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.466
Get it? "Blow Pop." "Blow… <i>job."</i>

12:39.300 --> 12:41.051
Yeah. I get it.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.472
-It's just a rumor.
-Hey, everybody. Who let the pigs out?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.808
I did, because I ordered the fetal pigs.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.226
[ironic chuckle]

12:49.727 --> 12:51.437
But seriously, get in your groups.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.608
Mr. Palmer, my partner is absent.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.777
Who wants to take Samantha in?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.528
This little piggy needs a group.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.198
Don't all volunteer at once.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.243
We'll take her.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.253
Thank you.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.963
I'm gonna go grab a chair.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.715
Yeah. No problem.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.091
[Demetri sniffs]

13:21.175 --> 13:22.218
[exhales deeply]

13:29.558 --> 13:31.018
-[Louie] Shh.
-[car doo opens]

13:35.314 --> 13:36.607
[starts engine]

13:36.690 --> 13:38.734
[gasping]

13:38.818 --> 13:40.653
[revs engine loudly]

13:40.736 --> 13:42.196
[Daniel] Whoa! Whoa!

13:42.279 --> 13:44.573
What the hell is the matter with you?

13:44.657 --> 13:48.077
Starting a car in a crowded showroom?
What, are you out of your mind?

13:49.411 --> 13:50.454
What were you thinking?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.790
[Louie snickering]

13:53.499 --> 13:54.333
Screw this.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.507
Mrs. LaRusso]
It's OK.  Everything's fine, guys.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.967
It's fine. It's fine.

14:08.973 --> 14:09.890
Hey!

14:11.308 --> 14:12.142
Hey!

14:12.852 --> 14:14.520
Hey! Whoa! Ease up.

14:14.603 --> 14:15.980
Ease up. I surrender.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.898
You don't have to fire me, OK? I quit.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.943
Hey, Robby. It's Robby, right? Come here.
Right? It's Robby?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.862
You're gonna break your thumb there.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.864
-What?
-Make a fist.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.158
If you're gonna punch your boss,
you gotta make a tight fist.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.952
Thumb around the outside underneath,

14:30.035 --> 14:32.246
squeeze the knuckles,
extend the hand straight out.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.665
You see that?
All right, come on. Let it fly.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.208
Hit my hand.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.211
[chuckling] OK. All right.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.796
That's better.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.299
I'm sorry for calling you out inside,
all right?

14:43.382 --> 14:45.885
That's on me.
I should've heard your side of it.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.429
You're not the only one
with a temper around here.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.097
All right, well…

14:51.098 --> 14:51.932
thanks.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.394
Where you from? You from around here?
You graduate at West Valley?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.146
Uh…

14:57.229 --> 14:59.231
No. I live up in North Hills.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.735
It's, uh, not as nice as this. [chuckles]

15:02.818 --> 15:03.986
I grew up in Reseda.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.114
Before that, Newark, New Jersey.
So I know a thing or two about that.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.616
[Robby] Wait. Really?

15:08.699 --> 15:10.492
Figured your family came from money.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.580
Yeah, well, I guess things
aren't always what they look like, right?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.917
I'm gonna head back inside and announce

15:18.000 --> 15:20.377
the "sorry you almost got killed"
sales event.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.546
I'll see you in a minute?

15:23.297 --> 15:24.131
All right.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.936
What were you thinking for sex?

15:38.103 --> 15:40.189
Uh… Uh… I mean, I've, I've…

15:40.272 --> 15:43.984
Because in the male, this tract opens up
near the umbilical cord.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.487
-[Miguel exhales]
-So I think ours is female.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.738
Yeah, um…

15:48.656 --> 15:50.074
Yeah, I concur.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.330
Thanks for, um…

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
helping me out, by the way.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.627
Oh yeah. I mean,
I'm sure you would've found another group.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.754
I meant with the fight.

16:05.047 --> 16:05.923
Oh.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.926
Yeah, someone had
to take care of those assholes.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.970
But nobody else did.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.768
It was a pretty nice roundhouse.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.982
-Thanks. I'm taking these karate lessons--
-But you telegraphed the sweep.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.152
When you lift up your foot like that,
it shifts the weight to your back leg.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.862
More windup, less power.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.198
Wow. You know your stuff.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.909
I guess I should be
taking lessons from you.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.704
That was a freebie.
Next one, I'm gonna expect money up front.

16:36.787 --> 16:37.871
Of course, of course.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.332
Let's see.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.839
Do you guys want a banana?
People keep sneaking them in my bag.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.842
It's because of that stupid rumor
that I'm sure you have heard about me.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.051
-[Miguel] Oh, no.
-Yes.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.596
Stupid, stupid rumors.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.848
Hurtful lies.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.766
People are monsters.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.936
Yeah, you shouldn't worry about it.
Those guys are assholes to us too.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.771
I mean, they call me "'Rhea," so…

17:04.023 --> 17:05.024
Not anymore.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.694
Yeah, I guess you're right. Not anymore.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.365
OK, everybody. Fall in.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.992
[students chattering]

17:15.075 --> 17:16.076
Where is everyone?

17:16.910 --> 17:17.911
Crater face?

17:18.495 --> 17:20.247
Nose ring? Slingshot?

17:21.081 --> 17:22.082
They quit, Sensei.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.043
Are you serious?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.464
I mean, good.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.175
That was a test.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.261
I wanted to see who the quitters are.
Not you guys.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.096
You're in it to win it, right?

17:36.180 --> 17:40.267
You could be home playing your iComputers,
playing your video games, eating candy.

17:40.684 --> 17:43.520
Instead, you're here,
doing pushups, learning how to fight.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.441
Lip. Look.
Even Lip's tougher than those guys.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.319
-He's no quitter.
-Could you please not call me that?

17:50.736 --> 17:53.363
-Excuse me, what?
-Could you please not call me that.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.742
-Um, I'll warm 'em up, Sensei.
-No, Lip has something he wants to say.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.829
Sorry, speak up, Lip.
Or is your tongue messed up too?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.332
Are you one of those challenged kids?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.752
Um, the doctor said
I could be on the spectrum.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.297
I don't know what that is,
but get off it pronto. All right?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.800
If you don't want me to call you "Lip,"
don't have a weird lip.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.885
-Can't you get surgery?
-I was born with a cleft lip.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.678
This is the scar from the surgery.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.890
You mean it was worse before that?
Or did the doctor just screw up?

18:19.973 --> 18:23.018
Because if this is the after photo,
that sucks, man. You should sue.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.937
Can we just please change the topic?

18:25.020 --> 18:27.022
You don't think I want to?
It's right in front of me.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.608
You wanna be something
other than a nerd with a scar on his lip,

18:29.691 --> 18:31.068
you gotta flip the script.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.027
OK?

18:32.111 --> 18:35.823
Get a face tattoo or gouge your eye out.
We'll call you "Patch," all right?

18:35.906 --> 18:38.117
No, don't do that one.
You'll still look like a freak.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.789
Oh, great, really? Another quitter?

18:43.872 --> 18:44.873
[Miguel sighs]

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
Go away. No more lessons today.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.087
[beer cap pops]

18:51.797 --> 18:53.507
[Miguel] Do you have to be
so hard on them?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.801
Oh, come on, Diaz.
They're a bunch of losers.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.262
Some of those losers are my friends.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.139
Yeah, that tracks.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.558
[Miguel] And they're your students.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.018
You wanted a full dojo, you got one.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.062
Not full like that.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.439
Yeah, I get it, all right? They're losers.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.233
Maybe I'm a loser too.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.027
Are you kidding me?
Are you gonna cry now too?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.154
[Miguel] No, it…

19:15.988 --> 19:17.239
Never mind. It's just…

19:19.658 --> 19:21.618
You don't know what it's like to be us.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.288
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.381
You don't have to do that.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.302
Louie is gonna be handling your work
for the rest of the day. Right?

19:38.385 --> 19:39.219
Yeah.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.224
Robby, I'm very sorry
for yesterday's events.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.642
It's been brought to my attention

19:45.726 --> 19:48.478
that what I did
is considered not to be professional.

19:50.856 --> 19:51.690
OK.

19:52.983 --> 19:53.817
Thanks.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.778
Oh, and we have something for you.
[clears throat]

19:58.197 --> 19:59.531
-It's official.
-[chuckles]

20:00.490 --> 20:01.533
You've earned it.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.164
[Louie] Shit.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.042
-You need a hand with that?
-No.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.668
I better do it myself.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.338
Did the crime, I gotta do the time, right?

20:14.421 --> 20:16.298
And I'm sure
she's watching me from the camera,

20:16.381 --> 20:17.841
so I gotta make this look legit.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.635
All right. I'll leave you to it.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.804
Hey.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.807
You still trying to score some points
with my cousin?

20:28.101 --> 20:28.977
All right.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.939
Daniel likes to get a hard copy
of the sales report

20:32.022 --> 20:33.440
delivered to his house every night.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.359
He's old-school like that. You know?

20:35.442 --> 20:36.485
Amanda asked me to do it,

20:36.568 --> 20:39.529
but I'm sure she just likes the fact
that it's 20 minutes out of my way.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.114
Are you messing with me again?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.158
No, never mind.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.285
Just… just forget about it.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.330
-Just trying to make amends, it's--
-No, I'll go. OK.

20:49.164 --> 20:49.998
I'll do it.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.042
Only if you want to.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.711
OK, envelope's on my desk.

20:55.879 --> 20:56.838
Thanks, Louie.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.341
Don't lose it.
I'm in enough trouble already.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.259
[Robby] OK.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.429
Stevia?

21:04.513 --> 21:05.430
[scoffs]

21:05.973 --> 21:06.932
Not while I'm here.

21:12.771 --> 21:13.772
[laptop chimes]

21:25.742 --> 21:27.119
[sighs]

21:28.704 --> 21:31.999
[Miguel] <i>Science is murder!</i>
<i>Samantha, why did you dissect me?</i>

21:32.082 --> 21:33.917

21:34.501 --> 21:36.211
<i>I could've gone somewhere in life.</i>

21:36.795 --> 21:37.921
<i>I could've been bacon.</i>

21:38.380 --> 21:41.133
-[laughs]
<i>-Just joking. It's Miguel.</i>

21:41.216 --> 21:43.593
<i>Uh, let me know if you need the notes</i>
<i>from today's class.</i>

-[snaps fingers]

22:35.562 --> 22:38.065
[young Johnny] <i>And they could kick</i>
<i>all the way above their heads.</i>

22:38.148 --> 22:40.650
If I get those lessons,
then I could totally get it above my head.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.777
That's great, sweetie.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.653
Oh yeah, and they had this snake,

22:43.737 --> 22:45.906
and it had these huge fangs,
and it was just so cool.

22:45.989 --> 22:49.117
Oh yeah, they also had these headbands,
and it was so badass.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.286
-I can get the lessons, right, Mom?
-Hi, honey.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.454
How was work?

22:52.537 --> 22:55.749
[Sid] Shitty.
Savalas is being a real pain in my rear.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.251
I had to tell him who runs Lorimar.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.587
Well, Johnny had a good day.
Right, Johnny?

23:00.670 --> 23:01.505
Tell him.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.800
Yeah, I was wondering
if I could take a karate class.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.177
[Sid] Karate? Ha!

23:07.260 --> 23:10.347
Look at you.
You're a skinny little white boy.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.184
Besides, don't you get
in enough fights already at school?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.310
-Sid…
-[Sid] What?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.396
Look, the kid's a social reject.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.106
He doesn't have a single friend.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.025
Well, maybe this is how
he can make some friends.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.485
[Sid] "Make some friends."

23:23.568 --> 23:25.737
So, you wanna be the next Bruce Lee, huh?

23:25.821 --> 23:28.281
First it was a drum set,
then the roller skates.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.909
Whatever happened to the magic kit?
You were gonna be Doug Henning.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.453
He's 12. They go through phases.
They try new things.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.288
[Sid] OK, fine.
I'll write the goddamn check.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.041
I'll make it out to "Garbage"
because that's where it's gonna end up.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.626
-[mom] Seriously?
-What "seriously"?

23:39.709 --> 23:41.044
-[mom] Just…
-[Sid] Just what?

23:41.128 --> 23:43.880
-[mom] Just don't tonight, please.
-[Sid] What are you talking about?

23:43.964 --> 23:44.798
Every night…

23:44.881 --> 23:46.883
[soft rock music plays]

23:52.055 --> 23:53.265
[music ends]

23:58.478 --> 23:59.312
Yeah.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.691
[sighs]

24:51.156 --> 24:51.990
Hey.

24:52.073 --> 24:52.991
Robby?

24:55.869 --> 24:56.828
Did…

24:56.912 --> 24:58.663
Did you sense that I was here?

24:58.747 --> 24:59.998
Oh… [chuckles]

25:00.081 --> 25:01.708
-Reflection.
-[Robby] Oh yeah.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.667
Right.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.212
Uh, here's the sales report you asked for.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.296
[Daniel] Sales report.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.881
Yeah, this is, um…

25:09.132 --> 25:11.301
Yeah, this is good stuff. Very important.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.221
You didn't share this with anyone else,
did you?

25:14.304 --> 25:15.388
No, sir.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.348
Your eyes only.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.184
That's good.
We wouldn't want this sensitive material

25:19.267 --> 25:21.394
to fall into the wrong hands now,
would we?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.522
Damn it, Louie.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.149
[Daniel] That one's on you, pal.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.151
Next time you outsmart the dope.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.069
Yeah.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.696
Fool me once, right? [chuckles]

25:31.947 --> 25:34.991
That karate you were doing…
Where's the punching?

25:35.075 --> 25:37.369
Well, karate isn't
all punching and kicking.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.829
It's actually more about balance.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.165
That didn't even really look like karate.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.210
Well, blueprints don't actually
look like cars, either, do they?

25:45.627 --> 25:47.546
-What do you mean?
-That was kata.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.548
It's the foundation of my karate.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.508
It's cool.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.177
You wanna stick around?

25:54.803 --> 25:55.845
Learn a few things?

25:58.473 --> 25:59.391
Sure.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.144
All right.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.991
Three more absences, Sensei.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.325
Bunch of pussies.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.494
[Johnny] No, it's my fault.

26:21.454 --> 26:25.041
Since you joined Cobra Kai,
I have been hard on you.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.961
I've called you names.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.089
I've humiliated you.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.301
Some of you I've hit.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.053
And for that,

26:38.346 --> 26:39.431
I don't apologize.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.519
Cobra Kai is about strength.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.232
If you're not strong on the inside,
you can't be strong on the outside.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.194
And right now, you're all weak.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.531
And I know that

26:57.907 --> 26:58.908
because I was you.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.039
I used to have no friends.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.917
Used to be the weirdo kid.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.171
Not that weird. I hooked up
with babes and all, but…

27:11.254 --> 27:14.090
The point is, I wasn't always
the badass sensei I am today.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.969
Just like a cobra,
I had to shed my loser skin

27:18.720 --> 27:19.846
to find my true power.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.723
And you guys will too.

[shop bell jangles]

27:25.143 --> 27:26.353
Welcome to Cobra Kai.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.107
[Miguel] Eli, what happened?

27:32.192 --> 27:33.610
I'm flipping the script.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.112
Wait. Are you the kid with the lip?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.614
Nice cut, bro.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.158
You see that?

27:41.117 --> 27:44.829
Doesn't matter if you're a loser
or a nerd or a freak.

27:45.914 --> 27:50.001
All that matters
is that you become badass.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.629
Hawk.

-Fall in.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.890
Fear does not exist in this dojo, does it?

28:04.307 --> 28:05.308
No, Sensei!

28:06.726 --> 28:09.354
Pain does not exist in this dojo, does it?

28:09.437 --> 28:10.480
No, Sensei.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.819
Defeat does not exist in this dojo,
does it?

28:15.902 --> 28:16.820
No, Sensei.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.951
Class, are you ready
to learn the way of the fist?

28:23.576 --> 28:24.536
Yes, Sensei!
