00:06.340 --> 00:09.077

00:09.177 --> 00:11.045
* Gear up and go
in the GlamVan *

00:11.145 --> 00:12.746

* It's Sunny

00:14.148 --> 00:15.783

00:45.979 --> 00:49.217
(yawning)
Nap time.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.621
(humming)

00:53.721 --> 00:57.158
Sunny, what do you think
of these nail designs?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.993
Little red and gold leaves,
perfect for autumn.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.962
Wow, I love them, Blair.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.798
And I'm sure
our clients will, too.

01:04.898 --> 01:08.269
Hmm...
speaking of clients,

01:08.369 --> 01:10.904
shouldn't Timmy
be here by now?

01:11.004 --> 01:12.440
Unless I missed a detail,

01:12.540 --> 01:15.509
and I hardly ever
miss a detail.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.311
Um...

01:17.411 --> 01:20.114
Yes, he's over
20 minutes late.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.849
(shouting)
Timmy is late?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.417
Shh,
you'll wake up Doodle.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.386
(snoring)

01:27.188 --> 01:29.390
But he's never late.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.560
Mmm? Can't a dog get
a little sleep around here?

01:34.495 --> 01:35.896
I hope nothing's wrong.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.365
(phone ringing)

01:37.465 --> 01:40.268
Sunny Salon,
where every day is sunny.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.735
How can I help you?

01:41.835 --> 01:43.171
Hi, Blair, it's Timmy.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.038
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna be late.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.740
I'm kind of stuck
at the moment...

01:46.840 --> 01:49.277
and I mean  really  stuck.

01:49.377 --> 01:52.213
Up a tree!
(whimpering)

01:52.313 --> 01:55.082
Are you okay?
Up a tree?

01:55.183 --> 01:57.251
I was picking apples,
and my ladder fell.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.086
I grabbed a branch
just in time,

01:59.187 --> 02:01.622
but now I can't get down.
(Rox gasping)

02:01.722 --> 02:05.593
Unless I fall down,
and I'd rather not.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.828
We'll be right there.
Don't move.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.830
(hanging up)
Don't move.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.233
(struggling)

02:12.333 --> 02:14.235
Come on,
we've gotta rescue him.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.937
Doodle?
Five more minutes.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.607
(girls giggling)
Let's let him sleep.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.210
(Sunny whispering)
Ready... set...

02:22.310 --> 02:24.845
(girls whispering)
gear up and go.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.515
**

02:41.195 --> 02:42.396
Any sign of Timmy?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.865
He's got to
be here somewhere.

02:44.965 --> 02:48.436
Found him!
Over there!

02:48.536 --> 02:49.903
**

02:50.003 --> 02:52.139
(Timmy)
Yoo-hoo!

02:52.240 --> 02:53.807
Up here, Sunny.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.109
Hi, everyone.
Timmy!

02:56.210 --> 02:57.911
Don't worry,
we'll get you down

02:58.011 --> 02:59.112
as soon as we get
your ladder.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.581
(Rox and Blair)
Found it!

03:01.849 --> 03:04.051
Huh? Oh...
Huh? Oh...

03:04.151 --> 03:06.687
The ladder broke in two
when it fell.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.291
And neither piece
is tall enough to reach you.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.960
Then I'll never get down?

03:13.060 --> 03:14.262
Never say never, Timmy.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.897
Oh, I have an idea!

03:17.931 --> 03:19.166
I'm not sure now's the time

03:19.267 --> 03:21.502
to give Timmy
ribbon extensions, Sunny.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.837
(giggling)
I've got a plan.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.205
Grab a handful of hairnets

03:25.306 --> 03:27.375
and stretch them out
as wide as they'll go.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.176
Great plan! Um...

03:29.277 --> 03:31.579
what is the plan exactly?

03:31.679 --> 03:33.947
We make a safety net
and save Timmy.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.649
Great plan!

03:36.484 --> 03:40.321
(Sunny)
Over... under...

03:40.421 --> 03:43.357
Now pull... perfect!
Great!

03:44.792 --> 03:45.893
Okay, Timmy.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.529
All you need to do is jump
and we'll catch you.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.264
(gulping)
You know...

03:50.364 --> 03:52.300
I decided
I'm good up here.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.335
Tree living could be
a lot of fun.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
Plenty of apples to eat and--

03:55.969 --> 03:59.907
Close your eyes and jump!
That's what I'd do.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.575
But first,
tuck in your knees,

04:01.675 --> 04:03.977
turn your hips,
and pull your chin in.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.480
And be careful.
That's what I'd do.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.148
Tuck my hips to my knees?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.783
(girls gasping)
Whoa...

04:09.883 --> 04:11.985
Or-- or twist my chin?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.654
Go for it, Timmy.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.555
We've got you.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.057
Okay.
(deep breath)

04:17.157 --> 04:20.027
(screaming)

04:20.127 --> 04:22.330
Uh-oh!
Uh, this way!

04:22.430 --> 04:25.366
Oh...
Whoa!

04:27.835 --> 04:29.169
Ta-da!

04:29.269 --> 04:32.139
That was awesome!

04:32.239 --> 04:33.974
It-- it was?

04:34.074 --> 04:37.678
Oh, yes, it was, wasn't it?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.112
Thanks so much.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.581
What can I do
to repay you?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.483
You don't have
to repay us, Timmy.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.951
Friends help each other.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.487
But I took you away from
all your hair appointments.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.456
There must be something
I could do to make up

04:48.556 --> 04:50.090
for all the trouble
I've caused.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.092
(gasping)
I know!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.396
How about some apples?

04:55.496 --> 04:57.498
Yeah? I could eat apples.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.167
(giggling)
Maybe an apple
for each of us.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.702
I could do better
than that.

05:01.802 --> 05:06.239
(grunting)
Take a whole bushel.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.275
(struggling)
Wow...

05:08.376 --> 05:09.810
We love apples.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.412
Thanks, Timmy.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.483
Mmm, delicious!

05:15.583 --> 05:17.317
Well, I'm appled out.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.720
Oh, me too.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.955
The average person eats

05:22.055 --> 05:23.891
44 pounds of apples a year.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.160
I think I already ate
my whole year's worth.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.330
Well, if you're not
going to eat them--

05:30.431 --> 05:32.199
can't let them
go to waste.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.435
Hmm...

05:35.369 --> 05:38.338
(whistling)
Hi, everyone.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.708
Hi, Timmy, we didn't expect
to see you so soon.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.377
Everything okay?
Well, I was thinking about

05:43.477 --> 05:45.913
what a nice thing you did,
rescuing me.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.449
And I know how much
you love my apples.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.017
Did somebody say "apples?"

05:50.117 --> 05:51.452
Yes. As I was saying,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.854
I know how much
you love my apples.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.155
So...

05:55.255 --> 05:56.790
Somebody  did  say apples!
Yep!

05:56.890 --> 05:59.259
And I brought you
two more bushels.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.694
Wow.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.030
Here, let me
help you with that.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.231
Thanks, Timmy.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.700
That's, uh, sweet.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.537
Huh?
Oh, yes, thank you, Timmy.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.071
Yeah, thanks, Timmy.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.408
And there's plenty more
where those came from.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.847
Happy crunching.
(whistling)

06:19.947 --> 06:22.382
(Sunny groaning)

06:22.483 --> 06:24.317
Maybe we should've
told Timmy

06:24.418 --> 06:26.319
we didn't need
any more apples.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.656
I didn't want
to hurt his feelings.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.992
Besides, we could make it
through a couple more bushels.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.293
Right, team?

06:33.393 --> 06:36.464
Mmm, go team!
Let's do it!

06:37.264 --> 06:38.499
Good morning, everyone.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.802
Another lovely day--
Uh, thanks, Timmy.

06:42.836 --> 06:43.971
(grunting)

06:47.274 --> 06:49.510
More... apples, everyone!

06:49.610 --> 06:51.979
Just put them over there.
(girls gasping)

06:54.014 --> 06:55.749
(whimpering)

06:55.849 --> 06:57.718
More apples?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.956
Hello, again!

07:03.056 --> 07:04.725
More apples...

07:04.825 --> 07:05.693
(sighing)

07:05.793 --> 07:07.360
(bell ringing)
(wagon thudding)

07:07.461 --> 07:10.464
(grunting)

07:11.599 --> 07:13.467
(crashing)

07:16.169 --> 07:18.939
I'm okay!

07:19.039 --> 07:21.408
Apple?

07:21.509 --> 07:24.377
Sunny, I never
thought I'd say this,

07:24.478 --> 07:27.180
but we don't need
any more apples.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.683
(whistling)
Hello!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
Anybody want more--
oh-- apples?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.722
The salon's turned into
a giant fruit stand.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.525
But it makes him so happy
to give them to us.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.360
You gotta tell him--
Tell me what?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.729
Um...

07:41.829 --> 07:43.797
Timmy, I--
You know, Sunny,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.365
it's great seeing
these apples

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
go to someone who
really appreciates them.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.504
(sighing)
Actually, Timmy, we, uh...

07:51.905 --> 07:52.840
(chuckling)

07:52.940 --> 07:56.710
a... all appreciate
these apples!

07:56.810 --> 07:59.112
Not just me.
Right everyone?

07:59.212 --> 08:00.614
Uh-huh.
Yep.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.482
If only there weren't
so many of them.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.651
Doodle!
Doodle!

08:03.751 --> 08:05.318
Oh, you don't know how good

08:05.418 --> 08:06.687
it makes me feel
to hear that.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.890
It warms my heart.
'Till next time!

08:09.990 --> 08:12.359
(whistling)

08:12.459 --> 08:14.327
I couldn't do it.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.396
I don't want to hurt
Timmy's feelings.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.934
Yeah, you heard him.
His heart is warm.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.137
Sometimes, it's just
not easy to tell the truth.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.040
(sighing)
Better find
a place for these.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.244
(girls grunting)

08:31.344 --> 08:33.246
(Doodle panting)

08:33.346 --> 08:35.683
**

08:37.017 --> 08:39.887
No, Doodle!

08:39.987 --> 08:42.022
Uh-oh!

08:45.793 --> 08:46.426
**

08:46.526 --> 08:48.428
Doodle, are you okay?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.863
Speak to us, Doodle!

08:49.963 --> 08:51.599
One bark means
you can hear us.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.233
Two barks
means you can't.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.535
Hmm?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.037
I got you, Doodle.

08:57.137 --> 08:57.971
Wahoo!

08:58.071 --> 08:59.873
Here an apple,
there an apple,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.975
everywhere
an apple apple.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.877
I can't take it anymore!

09:03.977 --> 09:06.479
Hello? Sunny?
Are you open?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.617
Oh, no!
Our appointments.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.952
Sorry,
please come back later.

09:12.052 --> 09:12.953
Have a sunny day!

09:13.053 --> 09:15.623
We'll be open soon...
I hope.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.024
It's going to be
really hard

09:17.124 --> 09:19.226
to run the salon
if we can't get out

09:19.326 --> 09:21.228
and customers
can't get in.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.064
(sighing)
You're right.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.733
I don't wanna upset Timmy,

09:25.833 --> 09:27.367
but enough is enough.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.070
We have to get rid
of all these apples.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.905
But how? Hmm...

09:32.005 --> 09:34.307
I got it!
What if we round up

09:34.407 --> 09:37.911
all the apples and take them
back to Timmy's orchard?

09:38.011 --> 09:40.413
Uh-huh. There's so
many on the ground

09:40.513 --> 09:43.483
that he probably
won't even notice
if we leave more.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.653
He'll think they
fell off the tree!

09:45.753 --> 09:47.621
I hate to fool
Timmy like that.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.022
(Doodle sputtering)

09:49.122 --> 09:50.223
(thudding)

09:50.323 --> 09:52.059
(Doodle whimpering)

09:53.861 --> 09:57.330
Operation: Apple Return
starts now.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.266
**

10:04.705 --> 10:07.307
Here ya go!

10:07.407 --> 10:09.643
(girls panting)

10:22.723 --> 10:25.192
Whew, that's all of 'em.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.194
We're ready to roll.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.261
Whoa!

10:28.361 --> 10:29.963
**

10:32.265 --> 10:33.500
Um, Sunny,

10:33.600 --> 10:36.670
I don't think we're ready
for this much rolling.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.240
(gasping)
The apples are getting away!

10:40.340 --> 10:41.875
Hang on.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.115
(Timmy whistling)

10:49.616 --> 10:51.885
Is that... hmm...

10:53.453 --> 10:54.621
(gasping)

10:54.722 --> 10:56.757
Timmy alert!

10:56.857 --> 10:58.859
We can't let him see
the apples in the GlamVan

10:58.959 --> 11:07.600
or he'll know we're trying
to get rid of them.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.236
Hurry.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.106
(whistling)

11:14.574 --> 11:17.444
(all sighing)

11:17.544 --> 11:20.080
Oh, hey, everybody!

11:20.180 --> 11:23.283
What brings you out
of the salon on this fine day?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.819
(nervous chuckling)
Well...

11:25.919 --> 11:29.622
it is such a fine day,
we thought

11:29.723 --> 11:31.725
why not get out
of the salon...

11:31.825 --> 11:34.661
on this fine day.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.696
Right?
Fine day.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.799
Out of the salon.
Uh-huh.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.701
And perfect timing--
I was on my way over

11:41.802 --> 11:43.170
to drop off
more apples for you,

11:43.270 --> 11:46.706
but now I can just load them
into your GlamVan.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.677
(girls)
Um...

11:52.512 --> 11:54.047
Huh?

11:55.148 --> 11:56.383
Oh...

11:56.483 --> 11:58.952
(girls)
Um...
Ah-ha!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.588
Tippy-toes Timmy
wins again!

12:01.688 --> 12:03.223
Timmy, wait!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.392
Whoa...
(panting)

12:05.492 --> 12:07.895
Uh, Doodle,
what're you doing?

12:07.995 --> 12:11.564
(struggling)
Did I ever tell you
you're my favorite Timmy?

12:11.664 --> 12:14.768
You're the only Timmy
I know, but still!

12:14.868 --> 12:18.605
(chuckling)
I like you too, Doodle.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.173
(gasping)
Oh, no!

12:20.273 --> 12:21.474
(gasping)

12:21.574 --> 12:22.709
I can explain.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.146
No need.
But really.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.116
No, I understand.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.683
You do?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.953
You love my apples  so much

12:33.053 --> 12:36.156
you're going to bring them
everywhere you go!

12:36.256 --> 12:38.058
Whew! Yes!

12:38.158 --> 12:39.927
That's  what we were doing.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.996
Hmm, well, there's no room
in the van.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.832
So I'll just
bring these to the salon

12:44.932 --> 12:46.699
when I come for
my appointment later.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.069
See you soon!

12:49.169 --> 12:50.003
(both sighing)

12:50.103 --> 12:51.872
Close call.
Now what?

12:51.972 --> 12:53.907
We better get back
to the salon.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.943
With all these apples?

12:56.043 --> 12:57.610
We don't have a choice.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.046
Timmy thinks we keep
the apples with us

12:59.146 --> 13:01.448
wherever we go.
(sighing)

13:01.548 --> 13:05.118
Come on,
we'd better head back.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.087
**

13:07.187 --> 13:09.322
Well, we did it.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.559
We'll never get rid
of all of those apples.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.927
Never say never.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.563
We'll just have to find
a way to use them up.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.431
We could give them
away to customers!

13:18.531 --> 13:20.467
If we had customers.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.003
If we take this many apples
and just multiply...

13:23.103 --> 13:25.505
if we each eat
nine apples every hour,

13:25.605 --> 13:28.241
they'll be gone in...

13:28.341 --> 13:31.478
five months, two weeks,
and three days.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.913
Hmm...

13:33.013 --> 13:34.414
There has to be
some other way.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.748
(Timmy whistling)

13:35.849 --> 13:38.285
Hello!

13:38.385 --> 13:39.586
I'm here for my haircut,

13:39.686 --> 13:41.788
and I brought more apples.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.993
Wow, all of those apples
were in the GlamVan?

13:46.093 --> 13:48.661
I had no idea
I'd brought you that many.

13:48.761 --> 13:53.500
Oh, it's only been
a couple... dozen bushels.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.637
(girls)
Don't open that!
Oh!

13:57.737 --> 13:59.672
It'll start another
apple avalanche.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.008
The salon's full.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.610
We can't even get back in.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.146
So no haircut for me, huh?

14:06.246 --> 14:09.249
Sorry, Timmy.
Guess you'll have to--

14:09.349 --> 14:10.517
Oh, wait!

14:10.617 --> 14:12.452
I can cut your hair
in the GlamVan.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.587
**

14:18.025 --> 14:18.791
There you go!

14:18.892 --> 14:20.427
Shampoo and trim.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.029
Ooh, thanks, Sunny.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.830
Blair, ready with
the hair dryer?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.534
(dryer blowing)

14:27.634 --> 14:30.537
Just sit back,
relax, and...

14:30.637 --> 14:34.207
(sniffing)
Mmm, what's that?

14:34.307 --> 14:37.677
(sniffing)
It smells delicious.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.813
(sniffing)
Really delicious.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.850
It smells like...
Apple pie?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.818
I'm not a pie--

14:45.919 --> 14:49.022
Hmm...
Whoa!

14:49.122 --> 14:51.224
Careful, Rox.
Hmm?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.859
(Sunny)
They're piping hot.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.294
They must have
gotten stuck up there

14:54.394 --> 14:56.796
and the heat from the dryer
started baking them.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.598
(sighing)
Guess I'm not getting

14:58.698 --> 15:00.567
apple pie after all.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.402
Sorry, Rox.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.271
But there could be pie.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.975
Rox, you just gave me
a great idea!

15:10.643 --> 15:12.479
**

15:12.579 --> 15:15.215
We're going to make
apple pies?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.817
Not just pies,
there are all kinds

15:17.917 --> 15:19.619
of things we can make
with apples.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.588
Apple sauce, apple butter--

15:21.688 --> 15:23.523
Apple juice?
That's my favorite.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.159
So instead of
a lot of apples,

15:26.259 --> 15:29.196
we'll have a lot
of apple things?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.498
That's how we'll use
all the apples.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.633
We'll hold an apple festival

15:33.733 --> 15:35.035
right here at the salon

15:35.135 --> 15:36.869
and invite the whole town.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.173
What about games?
Oh, like an apple toss!

15:40.273 --> 15:42.575
And I can decorate
with an apple theme.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.012
And we can have music.
(humming)

15:45.112 --> 15:48.015
I can DJ.
Oh, I'm good at scratching.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.317
Hmm?
(chuckling)

15:50.417 --> 15:53.720
Perfect. We can get Cindy
to help with the baking.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.688
And I'll call Peter
at the florist shop.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.824
He's great at decorating.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.293
Let's get this
apple festival in gear!

16:00.393 --> 16:02.395
**

16:04.564 --> 16:06.099
Mmm.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.801
Instant apple core!

16:08.901 --> 16:11.104
This is gonna be great.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.645
(giggling)

16:21.348 --> 16:22.449
Mmm-mmm!

16:22.549 --> 16:25.318
Nothing better
than fresh apple juice.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.254
(grunting)

16:29.856 --> 16:30.957
Perfect.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.792
Open the GlamVan.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.028
**

16:43.203 --> 16:45.072
Come one, come all!

16:45.172 --> 16:48.508
It's the Friendly Falls
Apple Festival!

16:48.608 --> 16:50.643
**

16:54.814 --> 16:56.716
A little caramel.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.987
Thanks, Cindy.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.191
**

17:06.593 --> 17:07.860
Ooh!

17:07.960 --> 17:10.063
Here you go.
(giggling)

17:10.163 --> 17:12.665
Mmm, delicious.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.035
(record scrubbing)

17:16.136 --> 17:17.904
(Doodle)
They're coming! Look!

17:18.004 --> 17:20.207
**

17:21.341 --> 17:24.911
Then there's just one thing
left for me to do.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.679
**

17:33.886 --> 17:35.588
And the other side.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.992
There.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.365
This'll do the trick.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.638
Perfect.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.007
Sunny, what're you up to?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.777
Whoa!
(laughing)

17:57.877 --> 17:59.746
You look amazing.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.080
Whoa, Sunny!

18:01.181 --> 18:03.650
And perfect for
our apple festival.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.819
Thanks.
An apple updo.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.954
That's one for
the Style Files.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.689
(camera shutter clicking)

18:09.789 --> 18:11.924
Ready to show the crowd?
Yeah!

18:12.024 --> 18:14.461
DJ Doodle, hit it!

18:14.561 --> 18:16.263
**

18:16.363 --> 18:19.098
Welcome, everyone,

18:19.199 --> 18:22.402
Friendly Falls Apple Festival.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.997
(Sunny)
* When we all come together

18:51.097 --> 18:52.999
(girls)
* Then you will see

18:53.099 --> 18:56.769
* There is a world

18:56.869 --> 18:59.005
* So now let's celebrate

18:59.105 --> 19:00.940
* Yeah,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.720

apple-toss to play *

19:13.820 --> 19:17.290
* With all these apples
we've made this a holiday *
* Whoo!

19:17.390 --> 19:21.294
* Oh, yeah, we're calling out

19:38.110 --> 19:39.679
(crowd cheering)

19:42.682 --> 19:44.717
You were great, Sunny!

19:44.817 --> 19:46.753
You're the apple queen.

19:46.853 --> 19:47.954
Thanks, Timmy.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.089
And thanks for all
your delicious apples.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.825
We couldn't have done
any of this without them.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.461
I've been thinking
about that.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.796
Now that you've used up
all your apples

19:56.896 --> 19:57.964
for the festival,

19:58.064 --> 19:59.266
there are none
left for you.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.335
Yeah, that's too bad but--
Lucky for you,

20:02.435 --> 20:04.671
I have plenty more
back at the orchard.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.806
I can have three bushels
to you by morning.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.841
Um...

20:08.941 --> 20:11.143
(sighing)
Timmy,

20:11.244 --> 20:15.415
you know when people say
honesty is the best policy?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.450
Well, this is hard
to tell you but...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.386
You can tell me
anything, Sunny.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.188
We're friends.
It's been so nice of you

20:22.289 --> 20:23.656
to bring us apples

20:23.756 --> 20:25.758
and we're very grateful.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.194
But I have to ask you to stop.

20:28.295 --> 20:31.063
Really? Why?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.232
We had so many apples,
we couldn't fit them

20:33.333 --> 20:34.934
in the salon anymore.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.269
I should've said something,

20:36.369 --> 20:38.471
but I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.407
(gasping)

20:41.808 --> 20:43.276
I hope you're not upset.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.778
Or hurt. Or angry.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.648
Or all three.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.149
Whew.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.051
Thank goodness.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.386
What?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.855
I can finally stop
picking apples.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.189
I kept bringing
them because

20:57.290 --> 20:59.158
I thought you
liked them so much.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.993
Really? I guess
it would've

21:01.093 --> 21:03.996
just been better if we all just
said what we were feeling.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.798
But I'm glad
you told me, Sunny.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.568
And to show there
are no hard feelings,

21:08.668 --> 21:11.904
my peach trees will
start blooming soon.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.973
I can bring you
a couple bushels

21:14.073 --> 21:15.942
as soon as they're ripe.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.777
(girls gasping)

21:17.877 --> 21:20.580
(cackling)

21:20.680 --> 21:22.782
I'm just kidding.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.051
(all laughing)

21:25.151 --> 21:27.019
(record scrubbing)

21:27.119 --> 21:29.722
One more time, Sunny.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.393
* 'Cause if life
hands you apples *

21:33.493 --> 21:35.261
* Make an apple pie

21:35.362 --> 21:37.530
* Oh, yeah, when life
hands you apples *

21:37.630 --> 21:39.566
* Make an apple pie *

21:39.666 --> 21:40.833
(crowd cheering)

21:42.001 --> 21:43.436
Hi! It's me, Sunny,

21:43.536 --> 21:46.406
with another look
inside the Style Files.

21:47.273 --> 21:50.443
Whoa, I love your apple updo!

21:51.578 --> 21:53.079

22:00.019 --> 22:01.421
