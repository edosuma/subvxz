Peter Pan shouts...

01:42.145 --> 01:45.079

did believe always...

01:55.955 --> 01:58.583
even as she left
childhood behind...

01:58.624 --> 02:00.649
and came to have
children of her own:

02:00.693 --> 02:04.092
There it is, Jane--
second star to the right...

02:04.128 --> 02:06.187

03:04.274 --> 03:06.742
England is threatened
with war...

03:06.776 --> 03:08.174
and many men have been asked...

03:08.210 --> 03:10.508
to leave thelr famllles
to protect their country.

03:11.643 --> 03:14.304

03:26.354 --> 03:28.720
[Sniffles] Mm-hmm.

03:28.756 --> 03:31.656
That's my big girl.

03:33.493 --> 03:35.188
Be safe, Edward.

03:59.212 --> 04:02.204
NARRATOR: But the war
lasted much longer...

04:02.249 --> 04:04.444
than anyone
could have imagined:

04:04.484 --> 04:07.008
Bombs fell from the sky...

04:07.052 --> 04:11.010
and tore at the very heart
of London.

04:11.055 --> 04:13.682
Don't cry, son.

04:13.724 --> 04:15.055

NARRATOR: in an effort
to protect its children...

04:17.760 --> 04:19.284
the government decreed...

04:19.327 --> 04:22.626
that they all be sent to the
countryside for safekeeping.

04:22.664 --> 04:24.631
-Good-bye!
-Good-bye!

Good-bye!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.230

-Good luck, sweetie!

04:28.269 --> 04:30.236
NARRATOR:
in times such as these...

04:30.270 --> 04:34.036
it is no wonder some
discard childish things...

04:34.073 --> 04:37.370
like Peter Pan and Never Land.

04:37.408 --> 04:38.807

Nanatwo, we're not
out of the woods yet.

05:57.036 --> 05:58.559
We have to get back out there!

05:58.604 --> 06:00.299
[Vocalizes]

06:00.339 --> 06:02.898

06:20.955 --> 06:23.514
I don't like planes and bombs.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.751
Is that what it is?

06:25.791 --> 06:31.194
For a moment, it sounded
like cannons on a pirate ship.

06:31.229 --> 06:34.129
[Gasps] You're right!

06:34.164 --> 06:36.223
It's Captain Hook!

06:36.267 --> 06:37.461
Uhh!

06:37.501 --> 06:41.026
A hero! He's coming!

Where have you been?
Why didn't you--

06:50.910 --> 06:52.104
Mother, I'm fine!

06:52.145 --> 06:54.773
DANNY: Jane, you made it
past the pirates!

06:54.814 --> 06:56.075
Daniel, careful!

06:56.115 --> 06:58.207
-What's that? What's that?
-Whoa!

06:58.249 --> 06:59.375
-Uhh!
-Uhh! Hey!

06:59.417 --> 07:01.942
It's for me, isn't it?
Let me see! Let me see!

07:01.986 --> 07:05.352

Happy birthday, Daniel.

Yippee!

07:07.224 --> 07:08.383
[Rustles]

07:08.424 --> 07:11.723
Socks. Two of 'em.

07:11.761 --> 07:16.094
Jane, dear, how very practical.

07:16.131 --> 07:19.565
Got them a size large
so he can grow into them.

07:19.599 --> 07:21.794
[Sighs]

07:21.834 --> 07:26.065
Look, Danny, Pan and Hook, see?

07:26.104 --> 07:27.230
[Wendy imitates Hook]
Curse you, Peter Pan!

07:27.272 --> 07:28.569
Oh, Mother.

07:28.607 --> 07:30.938
I want to hear
a Peter Pan story!

07:30.975 --> 07:32.532
[Woof woof woof woof]

07:32.575 --> 07:33.735
Shh! Nanatwo!

07:33.777 --> 07:35.642
WENDY: All rlght, then.

07:35.679 --> 07:39.512
How about the time
Peter and the Lost Boys...

07:39.548 --> 07:43.643
captured Hook's ship
right from under his nose?

07:43.685 --> 07:45.619
DANNY: Ooh! That's a good one!

07:45.653 --> 07:48.314
WENDY: it was late
one misty evening...

07:48.355 --> 07:50.016
and Hook was sure once again...

07:50.057 --> 07:51.921
that he'd found
Peter's hideout.

07:51.957 --> 07:54.585
Hook and hls bloodthirsty crew
went ashore...

07:54.627 --> 07:57.424
leaving the Jolly Roger
unguarded.

07:57.462 --> 08:02.159
That's when Peter Pan arrived!

08:02.198 --> 08:05.634
He and the Boys
slipped aboard...

08:05.668 --> 08:09.626
and there they found it--
Hook's remarkable treasure!

08:09.671 --> 08:11.035
DANNY: Wow!

08:11.072 --> 08:12.630
WENDY: Peter told
the Lost Boys they'd hide it...

08:12.673 --> 08:15.904
and Hook would have to hunt
them down to get it back.

08:15.943 --> 08:19.399
it was all a great game
for Peter, and then...

08:19.445 --> 08:22.573
from out of the mist,
he was there--

08:22.614 --> 08:24.275
the evil Captaln Hook!

08:24.316 --> 08:27.375
A fierce and ferocious
sword fight was fast underway.

08:27.418 --> 08:28.578
[Thunder]

08:28.619 --> 08:30.779
Ha ha!

08:30.821 --> 08:32.846
-[Gasps]
-[Whines]

08:32.889 --> 08:35.413
-Give up, boy!
-Never!

08:35.457 --> 08:36.616
WENDY: And at that moment...

08:36.659 --> 08:38.626
a shimmering magic
covered the ship.

08:38.659 --> 08:40.150
DANNY: Tinker Bell!

08:40.195 --> 08:42.491
WENDY: Yes!
And the Jolly Roger...

08:42.529 --> 08:44.053
lifted into the sky...

08:44.097 --> 08:47.066
as Peter and the Boys
escaped with the treasure.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.260
[Bonk]

08:48.301 --> 08:49.996
[Sputters]

08:50.036 --> 08:54.494
Aah! You've not seen
the end of me, Peter Pan!

08:54.538 --> 08:58.497
HOOK: I'll get you for this
if it's the last thing I do!

08:58.542 --> 09:00.270
WENDY: So you see, Danny...

09:00.310 --> 09:02.106
Hook will never win...

09:02.144 --> 09:04.135
as long as there's faith...

09:04.179 --> 09:06.773
trust, and pixle dust.

09:06.815 --> 09:09.282
Poppycock!

09:09.317 --> 09:11.648
Aah! Slow down,
you old codfish!

09:11.685 --> 09:14.778
[Gasps] Oh, my notebook!

JANE: Daniel!

09:17.523 --> 09:18.955
DANNY: Come on, Jane!

09:18.990 --> 09:20.685
We'll beat old Captain Hook
together!

09:20.725 --> 09:24.820
Daniel, please.
I've no time for fun and games.

09:24.862 --> 09:26.022
You used to.

09:26.063 --> 09:28.963
You got to be the very first
Lost Girl ever.

09:28.998 --> 09:30.556
That was a long time ago.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.660
Yeah. Back when you were fun.
Nnhh!

09:34.703 --> 09:36.568
Nnhh!

09:45.904 --> 09:49.533
JANE: Honestly, Mother, I don't
know why you fill his head...

09:49.574 --> 09:51.200
with those silly stories.

09:51.243 --> 09:53.334
But they're not silly, Jane.
They're--

09:53.377 --> 09:54.536
[Knock on door]

09:55.712 --> 09:58.441
Take care of Danny, will you?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.107
[Knocks]

10:00.149 --> 10:02.117
Go on. I'll be right there.

10:07.087 --> 10:08.349
Yes?

10:08.388 --> 10:10.150
Evacuation, mum.

10:10.189 --> 10:12.885
Your children are scheduled
on the morning train:

10:12.925 --> 10:18.589
[Gasps] So soon?
But I haven't even told them.

10:18.629 --> 10:21.928
The sooner the better,
if you ask me. Good night, mum.

10:21.965 --> 10:25.957
WENDY: Yes. Uh...good night.

10:27.737 --> 10:31.001
[Whines]

10:48.618 --> 10:50.609
WENDY: Jane, dear.

10:50.654 --> 10:54.384
Will you promise me something?

10:54.423 --> 10:56.652
Promise you'll
watch over Danny...

10:56.691 --> 10:57.818
whatever might happen.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.121
What?

10:59.160 --> 11:03.255
[Sigh] You and your brother
are going away for a while.

11:03.297 --> 11:05.526
Away? Where?

11:05.565 --> 11:09.228
WENDY: All the children are
being evacuated to the country.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.292
It's so dangerous here...

11:11.336 --> 11:13.361
but you'll be safe there,
both of you.

11:13.405 --> 11:15.100
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!

11:15.139 --> 11:17.835
WENDY: But dear,
an order has been issued.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.365
Every chlld must go.

11:19.409 --> 11:21.536
But Daddy said
that I'm supposed to--

11:21.578 --> 11:24.375
I know, dear, but you
can take care of Danny.

11:24.413 --> 11:27.040
Tell him Peter Pan stories.

11:27.081 --> 11:30.710
He needs them, Jane,
and so do you.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.116
Please, dear. Promise me.

11:33.153 --> 11:35.586
JANE: No! I will not promise!

11:35.622 --> 11:39.216
Oh, Jane!
We'll be together again.

11:39.258 --> 11:41.122
-You must have faith.
-Faith?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.626
Trust? Pixie dust?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.787
Mother, those are just words
from your stories.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.887
They don't mean anything.

11:47.930 --> 11:50.956
DANNY: Yes, they do.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.992
Peter Pan says
they'll make you fly.

11:55.036 --> 11:58.562
JANE: Daniel,
story time is over!

11:58.606 --> 12:01.837
Look! It's a war.

12:01.876 --> 12:05.173
Peter Pan isn't real,
and people don't fly!

12:05.210 --> 12:06.734
They do too!

12:06.778 --> 12:08.507
JANE: Oh, come on, Daniel!
Grow up!

12:08.547 --> 12:10.741
It's just a lot
of childish nonsense!

12:10.781 --> 12:12.408
You're lying!

12:12.450 --> 12:16.317
WENDY: Jane, how could you
treat your brother that way?

12:17.686 --> 12:20.814
You think
you're very grown-up...

12:20.856 --> 12:23.551
but you have
a great deal to learn.
