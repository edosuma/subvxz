WEBVTT

00:01.565 --> 00:04.003
Okay, here are all my warm
Minnesota clothes.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.105
Let's see if we can
find you something

00:05.171 --> 00:07.273
to keep you toasty
on the slopes.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.309
Synclaire, Charles and I
are going skiing

00:09.375 --> 00:11.878
not to terrorize
the land of misfit toys.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.619
‐ Fine. What else is in here?
‐ Aha, see.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.320
Now this is what
I'm talkin' about.

00:20.386 --> 00:22.455
Alright, here we go.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.290
‐ Yeah.
‐ Lookin' good.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.527
What the hell is this?
What is this?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.665
Oh, snap, my retainer.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.934
[laughs]

00:34.000 --> 00:35.736
Hey, Synclaire.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.038
Eskimo Joe.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.573
Khadijah and Charles
are going skiing

00:39.640 --> 00:41.207
at Sugarbush next weekend.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.876
Oh, no. Unh‐unh.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.278
I am not about to let
my best friend

00:45.345 --> 00:47.247
go to Vermont's
exclusive ski resort

00:47.313 --> 00:49.249
looking like Bigfoot
at a tag sale.

00:52.118 --> 00:53.820
Let me take you shoppin'.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.557
Bump that. This stuff
might be ugly, but it's free.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.869
Khadija, allow me
to introduce to you

01:02.936 --> 01:06.406
a little practice
I like to call return churn.

01:06.472 --> 01:08.308
You buy what you need
for the weekend

01:08.374 --> 01:10.310
and then return it.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.048
That's stealing, missy.

01:18.251 --> 01:20.320
Oh, no, no, no.

01:22.055 --> 01:25.358
Besides, how's Khadijah gonna
look skiing down the slopes

01:25.425 --> 01:27.193
with a bunch of tags
flapping in the wind?

01:27.260 --> 01:29.630
That's ridiculous. Come on.

01:29.696 --> 01:31.898
She can take them off

01:31.965 --> 01:36.570
and when she is done,
I will simply put them back on.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.309
Have you ever paid full price
for anything in your life?

01:43.376 --> 01:45.612
Yes. This.

02:23.924 --> 02:25.225
So let me help you with that.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.528
'Cause, you know,
I can scrub a dish so clean

02:27.594 --> 02:28.529
you wanna eat off of it.

02:28.595 --> 02:30.430
[laughing]

02:31.765 --> 02:34.935
Well, if you want,
but, uh, I got energy to burn.

02:38.772 --> 02:41.107
Mm, well, vacuuming
does that for me.

02:44.578 --> 02:47.013
Gary is pretty hot
in the kitchen.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.982
How's he in other rooms?

02:49.049 --> 02:50.116
[chuckles]

02:50.183 --> 02:52.418
Girl, there's somethin'
wrong with him.

02:52.485 --> 02:54.821
I mean, I mean,
he's sweet, he's nice

02:54.888 --> 02:57.490
but he lacks a certain
spiritual depth.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.335
You ain't done
a freaky sneaky yet?

03:02.402 --> 03:04.337
We ain't done squat.

03:05.906 --> 03:08.141
Well, look at the bright side.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.777
At least you get to watch
Regine mope around

03:10.844 --> 03:12.212
'cause she don't even
got a date.

03:12.278 --> 03:13.714
[laughs]

03:16.082 --> 03:17.984
I heard that.

03:18.051 --> 03:19.886
And I do not date.

03:19.953 --> 03:21.888
I audition life mates.

03:21.955 --> 03:23.524
[laughs]

03:23.590 --> 03:24.591
What?

03:24.658 --> 03:26.560
Tonight's hopeful told me

03:26.627 --> 03:28.962
that he was
an agricultural scientist

03:29.029 --> 03:31.131
and then Overton spotted him
stacking fruit

03:31.197 --> 03:33.499
in the produce section.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.669
‐ Good lookin' out.
‐ Hey, hit the rock, girl.

03:37.671 --> 03:38.972
Look at it this way.

03:39.039 --> 03:40.941
A guy have full medical coverage

03:41.007 --> 03:43.777
and you'd never want
for cantaloupes.

03:43.844 --> 03:45.378
[doorbell rings]

03:52.252 --> 03:55.656
And I thought this doorway
led to the hallway

03:55.722 --> 03:56.957
not heaven.

03:58.491 --> 04:00.066
[laughs]

04:01.502 --> 04:02.769
If I'm not mistaken

04:02.836 --> 04:05.105
you Jeff Blake
from the Cincinnati Bengals.

04:05.171 --> 04:06.607
What's up, bro?

04:06.673 --> 04:08.575
‐ Yo. Hey, man.
‐ What's up?

04:08.642 --> 04:09.810
Hey.

04:09.876 --> 04:11.812
[indistinct]

04:14.981 --> 04:16.882
Is this Spike Lee's party?

04:16.950 --> 04:18.952
Uh‐huh.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.887
Come on in.

04:20.954 --> 04:22.589
Crudite.

04:22.656 --> 04:23.824
Canopy.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.926
Long‐term relationship, eh?

04:27.761 --> 04:30.430
Look here, man, pay no attention
to the tiny temptress.

04:30.496 --> 04:34.400
Um, Spike Lee live about a block
and a half down the road.

04:34.467 --> 04:36.503
Matter of fact,
I just saw John Madden

04:36.570 --> 04:38.872
pull up in a limo
about an hour ago.

04:38.938 --> 04:41.141
‐ Thanks, man.
‐ No, no, oh.

04:41.207 --> 04:43.777
No, no, no, you, ah!

04:45.879 --> 04:49.616
Thanks a lot, Overton. You just
sent away a prime candidate.

04:49.683 --> 04:52.819
The man's married and he lives
in Cincinnati, okay?

04:52.886 --> 04:54.420
Minor hurdles.

04:56.189 --> 04:57.791
Can I get anybody anything else?

04:57.858 --> 05:00.133
Oh, no, thanks, Gary.
I'm so full I'm sweating gravy.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.705
[laughs]
Well, this is so much fun.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.974
We have Max and Gary,
Kyle and Carmel

05:08.041 --> 05:09.943
and Khadijah and Charles

05:10.010 --> 05:13.514
and me and Obie,
and Regine and oh, oh..

05:15.682 --> 05:18.118
Well, you know,
you're not really alone.

05:18.184 --> 05:20.954
You're just the star
of your own one‐woman show.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.758
You're going to hell!

05:26.960 --> 05:29.062
Well, Regine
is such a trendsetter.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.064
Would anybody else like to get
the hell out of my house?

05:32.566 --> 05:34.635
Maxine,
always the gracious host.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.436
Okay, we're gonna be leaving
and leave you two

05:36.503 --> 05:40.073
to your own devices
and I do mean devices.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.274
Come on, honey.

05:43.409 --> 05:44.678
[cooing]

05:47.480 --> 05:50.350
Well, mama, let's go someplace

05:50.416 --> 05:52.953
where we can get naked
and nobody will stare.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.557
‐ Oh, I'll stare, daddy.
‐ Mm.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.860
Goodnight.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.368
Well, I'd, uh, like to thank you
for a wonderful evening.

06:02.435 --> 06:03.804
I mean, right up to the part
when you told us

06:03.870 --> 06:06.006
to get the hell out.

06:06.072 --> 06:07.407
You..

06:09.209 --> 06:10.511
Baby, would you like some help
with the dishes?

06:10.577 --> 06:12.112
Oh, no, no, no, I'll just
give 'em back to Khadijah

06:12.178 --> 06:14.114
in the morning. Come here,
come here, come here.

06:15.816 --> 06:17.483
Mm.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.920
‐ Mm, that feels great.
‐ Oh, yeah?

06:19.986 --> 06:21.522
‐ Yeah.
‐ How about this?

06:21.588 --> 06:22.523
Mmm.

06:22.589 --> 06:24.124
Ooh.

06:24.190 --> 06:26.126
Unfortunately, I gotta go.

06:30.831 --> 06:32.065
Well, you wouldn't wanna
derail the career

06:32.132 --> 06:33.767
of a young barrister,
would you?

06:33.834 --> 06:35.368
Derail, no, but I wouldn't mind

06:35.435 --> 06:37.370
if you pulled into the station
for a while.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.410
Ladies and gentlemen

06:44.477 --> 06:47.748
put your hands together
and welcome Khadijah.

06:47.814 --> 06:49.415
'Watch out for that tree.'

06:49.482 --> 06:51.351
James!

06:55.756 --> 06:57.758
[laughs]
Race you to the lodge.

07:02.669 --> 07:04.838
Well, well, well.

07:07.473 --> 07:10.443
Don't we look stylish
and deceitful?

07:10.511 --> 07:12.345
Exactly how much did you spend?

07:12.412 --> 07:14.615
[chuckles]
Well, put it like this.

07:14.681 --> 07:16.617
Visa sent me flowers.

07:21.087 --> 07:23.924
Now, Khadijah, remember,
in order to get a full refund

07:23.990 --> 07:25.959
you've got to be
very careful, alright?

07:26.026 --> 07:28.228
Don't fall, avoid rocks

07:28.294 --> 07:29.863
and if you must go
to the bathroom

07:29.930 --> 07:31.364
take your suit all the way off
and hold it

07:31.431 --> 07:33.934
above your head with both hands.

07:34.000 --> 07:34.935
[doorbell rings]

07:35.001 --> 07:36.036
Oh!

07:39.973 --> 07:42.108
‐ Hi, sexy.
‐ Ah.

07:43.176 --> 07:46.880
Oh, sookie‐sookie now.

07:46.947 --> 07:48.682
Girl, you look like
a big old bumblebee.

07:48.749 --> 07:50.684
Give me some honey.

07:52.753 --> 07:54.354
Look at you.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.089
[chuckles]

07:56.156 --> 07:57.290
Yeah.

07:57.357 --> 07:58.625
So you got all your ski stuff?

07:58.692 --> 08:00.426
Oh, yeah, yeah, my ACE bandages

08:00.493 --> 08:02.869
uh, heating pad, ice pack,
neck brace

08:02.936 --> 08:05.405
crutches, wheelchair..

08:05.471 --> 08:08.141
everything I need
for the great outdoor.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.476
Are we going to Vermont
or to the Bronx?

08:11.812 --> 08:13.213
[chuckles]

08:13.279 --> 08:15.181
See, it's gonna be great
having you along.

08:15.248 --> 08:17.283
See, usually it's just me
and my single doctor friends

08:17.350 --> 08:19.152
hangin' around that old lodge.

08:19.219 --> 08:21.487
Single? Doctors?

08:21.555 --> 08:23.524
‐ Hanging?
‐ See ya.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.891
No, come on.

08:31.532 --> 08:34.034
Mm, you're not
a bad cook at all.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.469
That Lobster Newburg
was perfectly done.

08:36.537 --> 08:38.071
Mm‐hmm, if you want seconds

08:38.138 --> 08:39.539
I can throw another pouch
into the pot

08:39.606 --> 08:41.542
while the water's boiling.

08:43.275 --> 08:45.579
There's really
only one thing I want

08:45.646 --> 08:47.581
after a romantic dinner
like that.

08:50.316 --> 08:51.552
[spits]

08:59.560 --> 09:00.827
I've been thinkin'
that maybe it's time

09:00.894 --> 09:03.003
we take our relationship
to a whole new level.

09:03.069 --> 09:05.338
[laughs]
My elevator button
says penthouse.

09:08.141 --> 09:10.143
I've been lookin' for someone
like you for such a long time.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.145
Yeah, it's been a long time
for me, too, brother.

09:13.413 --> 09:14.681
‐ Max.
‐ Yes.

09:14.748 --> 09:16.650
Yes, yes.

09:16.717 --> 09:18.484
You're the perfect woman
to take my virginity.

09:18.552 --> 09:20.186
Huh, ooh.

09:27.628 --> 09:28.895
A virgin?

09:28.962 --> 09:31.632
Sacrifice me on your altar.

09:34.467 --> 09:36.002
Thanks for coming over.
Glad you enjoyed dinner.

09:36.069 --> 09:38.004
See you later. Bye‐bye.

09:41.575 --> 09:42.776
A virgin?

09:42.843 --> 09:45.411
Let me explain, let me explain.

09:45.478 --> 09:47.380
See, my first love and I
decided that we would wait

09:47.447 --> 09:49.550
until we were married.

09:49.616 --> 09:51.451
I kept my end of the bargain.

09:51.518 --> 09:53.654
What did she do?
Cheat on you?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.889
The pregnancy
sort of gave her away.

09:57.591 --> 09:59.993
So for the past six months..

10:01.201 --> 10:02.135
[moans]

10:02.202 --> 10:03.369
...I've been lookin'
for the right woman

10:03.436 --> 10:05.371
to show me
what I have been missin'.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.775
Please.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.010
Ooh.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.178
[sobs]

10:12.245 --> 10:14.214
Now you're groveling.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.949
You have no idea
how much that turns me on.

10:16.016 --> 10:16.983
[gasps]

10:17.050 --> 10:18.652
[sobs]

10:18.719 --> 10:20.186
Um..

10:20.253 --> 10:22.255
Look, uh, you know, uh, look.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.724
I‐I need some time.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.693
Brother, man, I need some time
to think about this, alright?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.428
So, um, why don't you
call me tomorrow?

10:28.494 --> 10:29.462
Oh, this is perfect.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.865
Max, just when I get up
the nerve.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.366
And now I gotta wait
another night?

10:33.433 --> 10:36.036
Hey, hey, hey. You still have
that Polaroid I sent you.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.542
[laughing]

10:41.608 --> 10:43.309
‐ Hey.
‐ 'Hey.'

10:43.376 --> 10:46.079
Hey, I wanna thank you
for a great weekend.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.682
And maybe next time, we can
actually do some skiing.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.150
[chuckles]

10:52.686 --> 10:55.421
‐ Goodnight.
‐ Come on, come on, come on.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.691
So?

10:57.758 --> 11:00.627
‐ How did the outfits hold up?
‐ Just fine.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.803
Five minutes after I got there,
I twisted my ankle

11:02.869 --> 11:04.638
while tryin' to avoid
a dizzy waiter

11:04.705 --> 11:07.508
with a tray
full of Irish coffees, girl.

11:07.574 --> 11:10.043
You didn't wear
any of the outfits?

11:10.110 --> 11:13.346
Well, I did model..

11:13.413 --> 11:14.414
...the underwear.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.082
Oh!

11:18.885 --> 11:20.854
Okay, if you didn't
wear the outfits

11:20.921 --> 11:22.823
then you can return them
with a clear conscience.

11:22.889 --> 11:25.491
And God can take you out
of His holy doghouse.

11:28.929 --> 11:31.264
Gary is a virgin and he's picked
me to devirginate him.

11:31.331 --> 11:32.799
[gasps]

11:34.034 --> 11:36.670
Woah, Max, you better go
easy on him.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.572
Avoid the ridin' crop

11:38.639 --> 11:41.407
the blindfold
and the warm spatula.

11:42.676 --> 11:45.045
Girl, I know, I know.

11:45.111 --> 11:46.547
And for some insane reason

11:46.613 --> 11:48.348
I wanna be responsible
about this.

11:48.414 --> 11:49.950
Of course, you do.

11:50.016 --> 11:52.986
Because you wanna make Gary's
first time sweet and romantic.

11:53.053 --> 11:54.588
Well, if that's what
he wants, let him knock

11:54.655 --> 11:56.590
on Dr. Quinn's covered wagon.

11:57.858 --> 11:59.526
I get straight to it and do it.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.769
My first time, my boyfriend
rented "She's Gotta Have It."

12:02.836 --> 12:04.771
Before the opening credits
were over, I had it.

12:06.973 --> 12:08.909
I won't keep you in suspense.

12:10.243 --> 12:13.514
The first time
I shared my treasures..

12:16.517 --> 12:20.120
...was with Grant Rogers
the night before our prom.

12:20.186 --> 12:22.388
You couldn't wait till
prom night like everybody else?

12:22.455 --> 12:25.191
And wrinkle my fabulous dress?
Sheesh.

12:27.694 --> 12:30.897
My first time
was in front of an audience.

12:30.964 --> 12:34.568
My boyfriend and I were
on his bunkbed, right?

12:34.635 --> 12:37.738
His little brother was
in the hamper with a camera.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.876
I had to pay the little
extortionist ten bucks a month

12:42.943 --> 12:46.012
to keep those pictures
out of circulation.

12:46.079 --> 12:48.348
That reminds me, I'm late
for this month's payment.

12:49.950 --> 12:51.952
Alright, Synclaire,
come on, spill it.

12:52.018 --> 12:53.620
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
this is not the type of thing

12:53.687 --> 12:55.622
I discuss in mixed company.

12:58.659 --> 13:01.401
Synclaire, there are no men
in the room.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.770
Oh, i..
Oh, is that what that means?

13:03.837 --> 13:05.772
[laughing]

13:07.508 --> 13:10.010
Well, he was a..

13:11.111 --> 13:14.014
...tall chocolate fellow

13:14.080 --> 13:15.381
from, uh, North Carolina.

13:15.448 --> 13:18.218
He was in town
for basketball camp.

13:18.284 --> 13:20.887
His name was Michael.

13:20.954 --> 13:24.157
He could jump so high
he seemed to float on air.

13:26.593 --> 13:28.562
You know, I wonder
whatever happened to him.

13:41.274 --> 13:44.044
Okay, let's stay focused.
It's about me.

13:44.110 --> 13:45.779
‐ We're talkin' about me.
‐ Alright, wait, wait, wait.

13:45.846 --> 13:48.381
Well, Max, I think
you should go for it.

13:48.448 --> 13:50.250
I mean, it'll, it'll be
the first time

13:50.316 --> 13:52.886
that a man says to you
you're the best

13:52.953 --> 13:54.888
and know
that he's tellin' the truth.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.659
Maxine, you be careful now.

13:58.725 --> 14:00.594
When you're limbs
are all entwined

14:00.661 --> 14:02.769
your heart can get
twisted in there too.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.705
That's just what
I needed to hear.

14:04.771 --> 14:07.007
I'm gonna go tell Gary
that I'm not the one.

14:07.073 --> 14:09.409
Let somebody else
wax his Mustang.

14:17.483 --> 14:21.054
I brought a few things just
in case your answer's yes.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.056
Ooh‐wee!

14:24.490 --> 14:28.695
Rose petals to carpet
our stairway to heaven.

14:28.762 --> 14:31.364
Well, hold on, hold on,
you know I don't have a vacuum.

14:32.799 --> 14:34.735

not going through with this.

15:00.126 --> 15:02.669

you were so sensitive.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.070
Well, I am.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.707
I am a sensitive as they come.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.709
Now I don't need some man

May I have a goodbye kiss?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.272
Alright, it's only fair.

[moans]

16:04.771 --> 16:06.707
Now that you've rested your case

16:06.773 --> 16:11.211
I can unequivocally say
that you are no longer a virgin.

16:11.277 --> 16:13.580
Technically, I wasn't a virgin
after the first time.

16:13.647 --> 16:15.481

16:15.549 --> 16:17.383

16:17.450 --> 16:18.785
Yeah.

16:20.186 --> 16:21.988
Hey, could you get me
a glass of water?

16:22.055 --> 16:24.691

Coachin' is hard work.

16:26.627 --> 16:29.462
Ooh, wow, my goodness.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.064
You know, I have to admit.

16:31.131 --> 16:33.233
I've seen lots of raw talent.

16:35.368 --> 16:38.805
You know, with a couple
of months of careful guidance

16:38.872 --> 16:42.509
perhaps a few visual aids,
some stretching exercises

16:42.576 --> 16:44.845
to improve flexibility..

16:44.911 --> 16:47.480

...we could work out, Jack.

16:52.686 --> 16:54.054

‐ Actually, I'm goin' home.
‐ Why?

17:06.372 --> 17:08.273
Well, you said you didn't
want me crowdin' you, right?

17:08.340 --> 17:10.511
I said that?

17:10.577 --> 17:13.378
Well, your exact words involved
a tattoo and a biker's ass.

17:15.648 --> 17:18.652
Yeah, that's what I said.

17:18.719 --> 17:20.820
I'm not quite sure
of the protocol here.

you slept with junior

to find yourself

20:19.452 --> 20:21.722
liking somebody unexpectedly.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.624
And then fall deeper
than you intended
