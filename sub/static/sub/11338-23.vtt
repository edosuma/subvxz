01:00.505 --> 01:02.239
A heat advisory has been issued

01:02.240 --> 01:04.102
For Los Angeles and
orange counties.

01:04.102 --> 01:07.460
Temperatures reached 110
in the inland valleys,

01:07.461 --> 01:09.714
Creating increased power demands.

01:09.715 --> 01:12.533
City and county officials have
declared shifting blackouts

01:12.534 --> 01:14.229
On a rotating basis.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.922
L.A. DWP spokeswoman
Karen Cramer announced...

01:58.897 --> 02:01.298
What if it doesn't come back on?

02:01.299 --> 02:03.410
It's only going to be
off from 12:00 to 3:00.

02:03.411 --> 02:05.863
Yeah, that's what they say,
but what if they mess it up?

02:05.864 --> 02:07.132
Stop.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.589
But, honey, it's so-- seriously.

02:12.436 --> 02:16.180
Ohh...it can't get any hotter.

02:19.785 --> 02:21.463
What are you doing?

02:21.464 --> 02:22.967
It's 102 degrees.

02:22.968 --> 02:26.328
92 but...OK.

02:26.329 --> 02:28.934
Besides, we're on
the second floor.

02:31.292 --> 02:33.164
What was that?

02:33.165 --> 02:35.299
You stay here.

02:55.187 --> 02:56.654
You see anyone?

02:58.131 --> 02:59.320
I'm sorry.

02:59.321 --> 03:02.247
All right. Be quiet.

03:10.469 --> 03:11.669
Don't open it.

03:11.670 --> 03:13.571
I'm not going to.

03:14.873 --> 03:17.374
Huh. There's no one here.

03:18.075 --> 03:20.687
Oh, God. Oh, God.

03:20.688 --> 03:21.882
Come on, it's the wind.

03:21.883 --> 03:24.548
Come on. Come on.

03:29.087 --> 03:31.222
Damn it!

03:31.513 --> 03:34.234
- Yeah, real funny.
- I'm sorry.

03:35.426 --> 03:37.633
Maybe a garbage can blew over.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.434
Maybe a possum or something.

03:39.435 --> 03:41.501
Yeah.

03:44.569 --> 03:46.592
Honey. Huh?

03:46.593 --> 03:48.238
Did you shut the window?

03:48.239 --> 03:49.907
What?

03:51.349 --> 03:53.210
Oh, my God!

04:12.284 --> 04:13.995
Hey, what did Strauss want?

04:13.996 --> 04:15.620
She needs us in Los Angeles.

04:15.621 --> 04:17.098
Home invasion homicide last night.

04:17.099 --> 04:19.666
Officers found
Gregory Everson, 56,

04:19.668 --> 04:21.124
Beaten, with a gsw to the head.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.257
His wife Colleen
was equally beaten

04:23.258 --> 04:25.047
And raped repeatedly.

04:25.048 --> 04:27.508
Repeatedly?
That's what she reported.

04:27.509 --> 04:29.043
Wait, she survived this?

04:29.044 --> 04:30.511
He chose to keep her alive.

04:30.512 --> 04:32.272
An intentional witness.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.124
Everything but that points
to an organized offender,

04:35.125 --> 04:36.504
An experienced one.

04:36.505 --> 04:38.144
Was she able to identify him?

04:38.145 --> 04:41.555
She said he was white, with
mean eyes and repulsive breath.

04:41.556 --> 04:43.524
Rotten inside and out.

04:43.525 --> 04:45.600
Did he rape her in
front of the husband?

04:45.601 --> 04:46.693
Yeah.

04:46.694 --> 04:48.261
One home invasion
rarely warrants Strauss

04:48.262 --> 04:49.597
Personally sending us out.

04:49.598 --> 04:53.019
No, there's more.
Ballistics match a double homicide

04:53.020 --> 04:55.169
Downtown L.A., 48 miles away.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.785
Where 3 days ago, those 2
women were raped and killed.

04:57.786 --> 05:00.074
But last night was in the suburbs.

05:00.075 --> 05:02.009
They're afraid of
another night stalker.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.590
Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote,

05:56.591 --> 05:57.996
"And out of the darkness

05:57.997 --> 06:00.163
"Came the hands that
reached through nature,

06:00.164 --> 06:01.965
Molding men."

06:04.825 --> 06:07.340
This guy's way too good at
this to have just started.

06:07.341 --> 06:09.123
He pulled off hours of
torture and a homicide

06:09.124 --> 06:10.487
Without disturbing the neighbors.

06:10.488 --> 06:11.825
And robbed the house.

06:11.826 --> 06:12.927
That could be a habit.

06:12.928 --> 06:14.295
You think he started as a burglar?

06:14.296 --> 06:15.752
If it was just about the killing,

06:15.753 --> 06:16.823
He wouldn't bother robbing them.

06:16.824 --> 06:18.375
Wait, how did he
get in last night?

06:18.376 --> 06:20.939
Mrs. Everson said there was
a noise outside their door.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.555
They were outside of
their room a few minutes,

06:22.556 --> 06:23.992
When they came back, he was there.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.256
He distracted them.

06:25.257 --> 06:27.199
So he could climb through
their bedroom window.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.636
I'll have Garcia, see if that m.O.

06:28.637 --> 06:30.314
Was used in any other
home invasions.

06:30.315 --> 06:32.120
Well, victimology's
all over the map.

06:32.121 --> 06:34.940
3 murders and he managed
to kill men, women,

06:34.941 --> 06:37.635
Old, young, black,
white, Hispanic.

06:37.636 --> 06:39.292
That's about as random as it gets.

06:39.293 --> 06:41.301
Randomness implies a
lack of predictability.

06:41.302 --> 06:42.715
I think that's the point.

06:42.716 --> 06:44.417
All the varying
people in his message.

06:44.418 --> 06:45.858
He wants them all to fear him.

06:45.859 --> 06:46.772
Oh, and they will.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.919
Press got ahold of last
night's home invasion.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.157
JJ and I will set
up at the station.

06:51.158 --> 06:53.660
Dave, you and Reid go visit
Mrs. Everson at the hospital.

06:53.661 --> 06:55.490
Morgan and Prentiss,
the LAPD detectives

06:55.491 --> 06:57.210
Are waiting for you
at the everson house.

07:14.857 --> 07:16.432
You hear that?

07:16.433 --> 07:17.433
What?

07:17.434 --> 07:18.939
Exactly.

07:18.940 --> 07:21.825
What's wrong with us that we're
at peace at a crime scene?

07:22.443 --> 07:23.854
Hotter than hell.

07:23.855 --> 07:26.909
Techs must have
turned off the a/c.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.712
Huh. See?

07:31.116 --> 07:32.416
Oh, yeah. At peace.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.457
What's the matter, more
hot flashes, ma'am?

07:34.458 --> 07:38.242
Surprised a hotshot like you
doesn't need to cool down.

07:39.523 --> 07:41.263
When are the big guns coming?

07:41.264 --> 07:42.599
What's wrong?

07:42.600 --> 07:44.897
You afraid that they'll get
all the front pages now?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.829
Hey. I never asked for that.

07:48.241 --> 07:49.572
Detectives.

07:49.573 --> 07:52.393
Quite a crowd out there.

07:53.110 --> 07:55.215
Matt Spicer. Adam Kurzbard.

07:55.216 --> 07:57.640
Hi. Emily Prentiss.
This is Derek Morgan.

07:57.641 --> 07:59.776
Hey, thanks for flying out.

07:59.777 --> 08:00.953
So, what have you got?

08:00.954 --> 08:04.432
Got our hands full. Guy's been
across the city in a week.

08:04.433 --> 08:06.306
Seems completely random.

08:06.307 --> 08:07.832
You don't think it is?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.706
We're robbery-homicide
in Newton division.

08:09.707 --> 08:12.028
The first 2 vics were
right in the middle of it.

08:12.029 --> 08:13.863
The only thing that brought
us all the way out here

08:13.864 --> 08:15.861
- Were the bullets.
- And the assault.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.341
All the victims were raped.

08:17.342 --> 08:18.573
DNA match?

08:18.574 --> 08:19.582
He covers up.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.041
The, uh, Eversons
were in their bedroom

08:21.042 --> 08:22.772
Upstairs when the
electricity went out.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.054
So the unsub cut the power.

08:24.055 --> 08:27.125
No. They've got rolling
blackouts scheduled.

08:27.126 --> 08:28.657
Trying to get through
this heat wave

08:28.658 --> 08:30.459
Without the whole city going dark.

08:30.460 --> 08:32.693
So, is that why he came out here?

08:32.693 --> 08:34.357
Well, people are
afraid of the dark.

08:34.359 --> 08:36.243
He probably preyed on that.

08:36.244 --> 08:39.010
Ok, so the lights go out and this
guy starts banging on the door.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.448
Why give them the heads-up like that?
Why not just break in?

08:41.448 --> 08:43.325
He probably likes getting
their adrenaline going.

08:43.326 --> 08:44.681
Makes for a fun fight.

08:44.682 --> 08:47.222
Sounds like he got one.
Wife's real shook up.

08:47.223 --> 08:49.661
I don't think she's
gonna be much help.

08:51.435 --> 08:53.794
Why is she in restraints?

08:54.215 --> 08:57.246
She tried to kill herself.

08:57.642 --> 08:59.937
Twice.

09:04.982 --> 09:06.985
Mrs. Everson?

09:07.618 --> 09:10.320
We're with the FBI.

09:14.885 --> 09:18.995
We know you talked to the
detectives this morning.

09:18.996 --> 09:21.599
But if you're up for
a few more questions,

09:21.600 --> 09:24.100
It could help.

09:25.413 --> 09:29.214
Why didn't he kill me?

09:33.339 --> 09:35.753
It--it wasn't about you.

09:35.754 --> 09:39.784
This man only thinks about power

09:39.785 --> 09:42.355
And control.

09:44.855 --> 09:48.858
Leaving you behind gives him that.

09:50.527 --> 09:52.555
Now...

09:52.556 --> 09:56.308
Did he ever speak to you directly?

10:01.075 --> 10:03.510
Did you talk to you?

10:03.511 --> 10:06.537
No, he really didn't.

10:06.538 --> 10:07.932
I'm sorry. It's OK.

10:07.933 --> 10:10.723
Take your time.

10:10.891 --> 10:13.560
Greg looked at me...

10:13.561 --> 10:17.230
The way he always did. I...

10:17.231 --> 10:20.489
We didn't need words. We...

10:20.490 --> 10:23.083
He just...

10:23.084 --> 10:25.861
Looked at me and we would know.

10:26.592 --> 10:30.944
I tried to be strong, but I--I...

10:30.945 --> 10:34.746
Shut my eyes...

10:34.747 --> 10:38.156
When the gun went off, and...

10:38.157 --> 10:41.588
That's the last thing Greg saw.

10:41.589 --> 10:45.559
Now every time I shut my eyes...

10:46.181 --> 10:49.129
I see him.

10:49.725 --> 10:52.532
How long will that last?

10:58.536 --> 11:00.774
You rest now.

11:09.152 --> 11:11.527
Uh-huh, yeah.
We'll have him on the 11:00.

11:11.528 --> 11:12.967
Thanks.

11:12.968 --> 11:14.034
Hey. Where's Rossi?

11:14.035 --> 11:15.772
He's talking with
Hotch and Morgan.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.628
It's incredibly detailed.

11:19.629 --> 11:21.923
Yeah. Detective Matt Spicer and
his partner are the go-to guys

11:21.924 --> 11:24.039
For robbery-homicide, central
bureau, Newton division,

11:24.040 --> 11:26.090
The busiest in L.A.

11:30.664 --> 11:31.726
It's Garcia.

11:31.727 --> 11:33.224
Hey, Garcia, I got JJ here.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.834
Praise the gods. Los Angeles

11:34.835 --> 11:37.999
Has a weirdly low rate of
home invasion burglaries.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.070
I snagged a case in Westchester

11:40.071 --> 11:43.805
Where a guy violently
knocked down the front door,

11:43.806 --> 11:45.932
Kicked the dog, and
took off with the TV.

11:45.933 --> 11:47.401
Breaking down the front
door sends a message.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.100
He's trying to
intimidate the victims.

11:49.101 --> 11:52.136
Yeah, and as horrible as this
dog-kicking burglar sounds,

11:52.137 --> 11:54.400
I think the guy we're looking
for is even more horrible.

11:54.401 --> 11:56.618
Garcia, this unsub's had
practice, a lot of it.

11:56.619 --> 11:58.954
Maybe not in L.A., but he's
definitely done this before.

11:58.955 --> 12:00.660
Word. This is not his
first crime party.

12:00.661 --> 12:02.837
I seriously can't find
a single case in L.A.

12:02.838 --> 12:05.298
That equals this level
of emotional destruction.

12:05.299 --> 12:07.489
We need to expand the search
to all of Southern California.

12:07.490 --> 12:09.316
He can be in other cities with
a quick ride on the freeways.

12:09.317 --> 12:11.532
Yeah. Will do. Thanks, Garcia.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.402
We're going live
on the 11:00 news.

12:14.403 --> 12:15.477
You think he'll be watching?

12:15.478 --> 12:18.134
It's late. He could
already be hunting.

12:26.015 --> 12:28.917
Do you ever look at why
this victim, why this day,

12:28.918 --> 12:30.282
Why this crime?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.055
- Always.
- Hmm.

12:32.056 --> 12:33.452
Do you ever think they were
just in the wrong place

12:33.453 --> 12:35.329
At the wrong time? Sometimes.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.392
Well, I don't believe
in coincidences.

12:37.393 --> 12:38.296
How come?

12:38.297 --> 12:39.707
Don't get me wrong.
It's not like I talk

12:39.708 --> 12:40.854
To the universe or anything.

12:40.855 --> 12:43.777
I've just always believed that
things happen for a reason.

12:43.778 --> 12:45.974
It's hard to find the
reason for this, though.

12:45.975 --> 12:47.882
Utterly meaningless crimes,

12:47.883 --> 12:49.304
No obvious motivation.

12:49.305 --> 12:52.101
Pure evil. Evil can't be
scientifically defined.

12:52.102 --> 12:54.396
It's an illusory moral concept
that doesn't exist in nature.

12:54.397 --> 12:56.401
Its origins and connotations
have been inextricably linked

12:56.402 --> 12:58.120
To religion and mythology.

12:58.121 --> 13:00.413
This offender has shown
no signs of any belief.

13:00.414 --> 13:03.685
I'm, uh, I'm Spencer Reid.
Matt Spicer.

13:03.719 --> 13:05.204
Jennifer Jareau.

13:05.205 --> 13:06.588
The media's been asking for you.

13:06.589 --> 13:08.490
Yeah, well, nobody else around
here wants to talk to them.

13:08.491 --> 13:09.991
I figure it hasn't hurt me yet.

13:09.992 --> 13:12.206
Uh, they'd like to interview
you for the 11:00 news.

13:12.207 --> 13:14.872
Can we go over a few points?
Absolutely.

13:15.831 --> 13:17.667
The first 2 victims
earlier this week?

13:17.668 --> 13:19.834
Downtown. Killed about 2 A.M.

13:19.835 --> 13:22.570
We found them when
the sun came up.

13:25.184 --> 13:26.338
Not at noon?

13:26.339 --> 13:29.444
Right. Vice were over
there about 6 A.M.

13:30.346 --> 13:33.548
Both these clocks are
stopped at 12:00.

13:33.549 --> 13:35.247
Was there a blackout?

13:35.651 --> 13:37.085
They started last night.

13:37.086 --> 13:38.853
So then he cut their power.

13:38.854 --> 13:40.867
But he let the city
do it last night.

13:40.868 --> 13:43.124
Where's the next rolling blackout?

13:45.215 --> 13:47.400
If you're driving through
the San Fernando valley,

13:47.401 --> 13:50.098
Beware--the power in
Glendale has just gone out,

13:50.099 --> 13:51.699
Thanks to the rolling blackouts.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.401
Stay tuned for further details.

13:53.402 --> 13:55.270
Now let's take a
look at the weather.

13:55.271 --> 13:57.799
Well, the heat is not
gonna break anytime soon,

13:57.800 --> 14:00.304
With temperatures still
hovering at 97 degrees.

14:00.305 --> 14:02.054
Look for overnight
lows to be about 90.

14:02.055 --> 14:03.244
Same situation for tomorrow...

14:03.245 --> 14:05.648
Oh, come on.

14:32.708 --> 14:35.163
Ok, sweetie, we're home.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.443
Officers arrived at the
home of Annie Danzi

15:25.444 --> 15:27.133
Just after 11:00 this morning...

15:27.134 --> 15:29.415
This time a young
child was left behind.

15:29.416 --> 15:32.482
LAPD investigator Matt Spicer
is the lead on this case...

15:32.483 --> 15:35.489
...HELD BY THE FBI's BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT LATER THIS MORNING.

15:35.490 --> 15:38.068
The profilers arrived in
Los Angeles last night.

15:38.069 --> 15:39.228
We're going live now
to Annie Danzi's home.

15:39.229 --> 15:42.024
We've been told the
FBI has just arrived.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.326
Agent Jareau. Agent Jareau.

15:44.327 --> 15:46.543
This is the second
home invasion homicide

15:46.544 --> 15:47.797
That started since the blackouts.

15:47.798 --> 15:49.265
Will you confirm that
they're connected?

15:49.266 --> 15:51.801
How are you going to keep the
residents safe in these areas?

15:51.802 --> 15:54.813
We're working close with
city officials and LAPD

15:54.814 --> 15:58.278
To determine what steps we need to
take to ensure everyone's safety.

15:58.279 --> 15:59.839
Will they call off the blackouts?

15:59.840 --> 16:01.303
Not at this time.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.431
Annie Danzi.

16:03.432 --> 16:04.996
30, single mom.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.515
Was her child home?

16:06.516 --> 16:08.388
Spicer's with him now.

16:11.695 --> 16:13.690
So the power was
out 10:00 to 1:00?

16:13.691 --> 16:15.327
All the same tricks.

16:15.328 --> 16:17.801
Forced entry?-No.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.558
Were there rolling
blackouts last summer?

16:19.559 --> 16:21.049
Oh, just about every year.

16:21.050 --> 16:22.639
Anything like this happen?

16:22.640 --> 16:24.902
Well, crime always goes
up when it's hot and dark,

16:24.903 --> 16:26.728
But this?

16:27.434 --> 16:28.511
No way.

16:28.512 --> 16:31.176
Hunting in the dark is definitely
a part of his signature.

16:36.164 --> 16:37.679
Garcia. Yes, sir.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.214
I need you to check if
there were any clusters

16:39.215 --> 16:41.065
Of home invasions
in previous summers

16:41.066 --> 16:43.664
During rolling blackouts in
California. Look statewide.

16:43.665 --> 16:46.400
He left a message this time.

16:46.610 --> 16:49.653
***

16:51.868 --> 16:53.834
A first time for everything.

16:53.835 --> 16:55.805
You think he's welcoming us?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.345
Who knows?

16:57.346 --> 17:00.526
At least he's telling us
more with each crime scene.

17:01.216 --> 17:04.561
Uneducated. Made the kid watch.

17:04.563 --> 17:06.574
Sadistic.

17:07.048 --> 17:11.329
Trashes the place even though
there's not that much to steal.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.094
Angry.

17:13.095 --> 17:15.762
Chooses to hunt and
kill in the dark.

17:15.763 --> 17:17.131
Doesn't want to be seen.

17:17.132 --> 17:18.665
Why?

17:19.085 --> 17:21.940
Maybe he's ashamed of something.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.876
Well, he didn't have
to knock those over.

17:25.829 --> 17:28.411
He doesn't want any eyes on him.

17:28.412 --> 17:31.163
Except the kid.

17:31.164 --> 17:33.180
Didn't want him to miss a thing.

17:36.686 --> 17:37.985
What you got there?

17:37.986 --> 17:39.562
Is that a robot?

17:39.563 --> 17:41.065
It's a monster.

17:41.066 --> 17:43.595
Monster, huh? What's it doing?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.450
It's protecting you, right?

17:46.451 --> 17:49.339
It's gonna make the man stay away.

17:49.340 --> 17:51.691
Did you happen to get
a look at that man?

17:51.692 --> 17:54.670
Or was it too dark under the bed?

17:55.450 --> 17:58.459
He moved me to the closet.

17:59.742 --> 18:02.158
And my mom told me
to close my eyes.

18:05.597 --> 18:07.973
Would you mind showing
me how you did that?

18:13.766 --> 18:16.383
That's good, kid.
That's really, really good.

18:17.982 --> 18:20.503
So you didn't see him at all?

18:20.504 --> 18:22.092
Once that man left,
what did you do?

18:22.093 --> 18:24.188
Did you get back under the bed?

18:26.483 --> 18:28.628
I didn't want to leave her.

18:30.123 --> 18:32.745
But you were scared.

18:35.702 --> 18:37.789
Hey, Carter,

18:37.790 --> 18:41.286
Do you, um, do you have
like a really cool backpack

18:41.287 --> 18:44.153
You could throw some things in to
take over to your cousin's house?

18:44.154 --> 18:46.312
It's in my room.

18:46.313 --> 18:48.039
Will you come with me?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.914
You bet.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.496
Hey.

18:58.497 --> 19:00.640
Look, I'm really glad the
kid didn't see anything,

19:00.641 --> 19:02.942
But it could have been helpful.

19:03.619 --> 19:05.954
But covering his eyes like that,

19:05.955 --> 19:08.770
That means he couldn't
cover his ears.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.857
Forcing a child to witness
this is clearly sadistic.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.961
He destroyed the boy's innocence
and took away his childhood.

19:21.962 --> 19:23.929
This probably mirrors the
unsub's own experience.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.065
That's an excuse for
what he's doing?

19:26.066 --> 19:27.713
There's no excuse
for what he's doing.

19:27.714 --> 19:29.501
We're not justifying anything.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.704
Everything he says,
everything he does

19:31.705 --> 19:34.373
Tell us what makes
him tick, that's all.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.212
The message that he
left us was misspelled,

19:36.213 --> 19:38.202
Which says that he was
not well-educated.

19:38.203 --> 19:39.378
Why did he leave one now?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.103
That we don't know--yet.

19:41.104 --> 19:43.315
Just because his recent
attacks are in Los Angeles

19:43.316 --> 19:45.484
Doesn't mean he's from here.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.270
Killing in the dark
is a must for him.

19:47.271 --> 19:48.517
We believe that's why
he's come to L.A.

19:48.518 --> 19:50.246
That and his willingness
to kill random people

19:50.247 --> 19:52.178
Tells us that he's an
opportunistic offender,

19:52.179 --> 19:54.785
And these types are incredibly
difficult to predict.

19:54.786 --> 19:57.506
And as you all know, the rolling
blackouts have been announced

19:57.507 --> 20:00.332
So residents can prepare for the
few hours they'll be in darkness.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.401
Unfortunately, that
also tells the killer

20:02.402 --> 20:05.437
Whose windows will be open,
whose alarms will be disarmed.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.517
The dark is his signature.
It's a habit,

20:07.518 --> 20:09.411
and we'll find That he's
always killed this way.

20:09.412 --> 20:10.566
'cause he's a coward.

20:10.567 --> 20:13.312
To some degree, yes.
He also has intimacy issues.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.281
He even turns photographs
away from himself.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.728
It's unlikely that a man like this

20:16.729 --> 20:18.817
Has been in any kind
of relationship.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.689
There's also a good chance that
he has some type of shortcoming.

20:21.690 --> 20:23.123
Whether real or perceived,

20:23.124 --> 20:24.990
He's obviously self-conscious
about something.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.642
Like what? It could be
like a physical deformity.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.244
It might be something
really small to us,

20:29.245 --> 20:30.482
But it means everything to him.

20:30.483 --> 20:32.331
People just want to fit in.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.018
Having one thing that sets
him apart from the norm

20:34.019 --> 20:35.663
Could be what led him
into the extreme solitude

20:35.664 --> 20:37.604
Of a violent schizoid personality.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.271
He takes his victims' power away,

20:39.272 --> 20:40.973
Literally and figuratively.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.443
And he feeds off of
making them powerless.

20:43.444 --> 20:45.678
We had rolling blackouts
all last summer,

20:45.679 --> 20:47.553
And this guy wasn't around.

20:47.554 --> 20:48.914
Well, he is now.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.050
And based on the vicious
nature of his crimes,

20:51.051 --> 20:54.053
The press has named him
the prince of darkness.

20:54.054 --> 20:55.988
Prince. That'll fuel his ego.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.295
Yeah. He's gonna be
all over the news.

20:58.296 --> 21:01.732
Once we unravel his need for
darkness, we'll find him.

21:15.539 --> 21:17.609
What if he comes back?

21:17.610 --> 21:18.877
He won't.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.946
He can't hurt you again, OK?

21:20.947 --> 21:23.682
How do you know?
You didn't find him.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.560
You're right. But I will.

21:28.776 --> 21:30.889
She should have known better.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.561
Who? Your mom?

21:36.087 --> 21:38.430
She tried to fight him,

21:38.431 --> 21:40.366
But he had a gun.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.164
Why did she do that?

21:42.165 --> 21:43.772
Well,

21:43.773 --> 21:46.467
She needed to protect you, Carter.

21:46.468 --> 21:50.516
The man who did this,
he's very bad, OK?

21:50.517 --> 21:52.419
I'm going to find him.

21:52.420 --> 21:55.315
I promise. Ok?

22:01.263 --> 22:03.287
All right.

22:05.247 --> 22:06.694
Thank you.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.762
Yeah, Prentiss. What's the plan?

22:09.763 --> 22:12.018
Rolling blackouts are still
scheduled for tonight.

22:12.019 --> 22:13.799
How's LAPD gonna patrol it?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.313
With the number of calls
they've been getting,

22:15.314 --> 22:16.347
They're stretched thin already.

22:16.348 --> 22:18.158
Well, then they gotta cancel it.

22:18.159 --> 22:19.338
That's the battle.
If they do that,

22:19.339 --> 22:23.149
The whole city could go dark if
the power grid gets overwhelmed.

22:23.150 --> 22:25.577
Yeah, you're right.
That's not gonna work.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.347
LAPD's outnumbered 10,000 to 1.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.447
All right, keep me posted.

22:31.029 --> 22:32.395
Did you tell her that we're
gonna need to talk to Carter

22:32.396 --> 22:33.811
Again tomorrow?

22:33.812 --> 22:35.587
He won't remember anything.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.056
We have psychological markers,
things that could help him out.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.657
You want to make him relive it?

22:39.658 --> 22:41.794
If it will help us
catch this guy, yes.

22:41.795 --> 22:44.761
I mean, you saw him.
He feels helpless, weak.

22:44.762 --> 22:46.298
There's nothing he could
have done about it,

22:46.299 --> 22:48.934
But he's gonna keep
blaming himself.

22:49.625 --> 22:52.905
You know, Carter didn't
reveal that much.

22:53.185 --> 22:55.335
How come you know all this?

22:55.336 --> 22:58.207
Because when I was a
kid, I lost my parents.

22:58.751 --> 23:00.582
How?

23:00.583 --> 23:02.375
Drunk driver.

23:02.376 --> 23:03.419
And you were in the car?

23:03.420 --> 23:04.729
No.

23:04.730 --> 23:07.821
You seem to have some insight,
as if you witnessed it.

23:07.822 --> 23:11.500
Maybe because I pictured
it a thousand times.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.875
My parents...

23:29.876 --> 23:32.244
They, uh,

23:32.245 --> 23:35.681
They were racing home
'cause I was sick.

23:36.427 --> 23:38.116
You know, if they
hadn't left right then,

23:38.117 --> 23:40.877
They would have missed
that intersection,

23:40.878 --> 23:43.322
And there wouldn't
have been a red light.

23:47.227 --> 23:49.619
I lost my father...

23:49.780 --> 23:52.098
When I was 9 years old.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.918
He was shot and killed
right in front of me.

23:56.703 --> 23:59.353
There was nothing I could do.

24:01.174 --> 24:04.810
So I choose to look
at it like this--

24:04.811 --> 24:07.079
We all have people in our lives.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.515
Some of them are good.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.151
Some of them are bad.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.357
But they shape us, Detective.

24:17.524 --> 24:20.058
That's why you have that badge.

24:20.261 --> 24:24.029
That's why the two of us are
sitting in this car right now.

24:32.711 --> 24:36.342
***

24:42.651 --> 24:45.560
***

24:47.263 --> 24:49.054
How's the boy?

24:49.055 --> 24:50.396
He's quiet.

24:50.397 --> 24:51.339
Too soon for an interview?

24:51.340 --> 24:52.665
Yeah, I want to
find this guy before

24:52.666 --> 24:53.818
we have to put the kid through it.

24:53.819 --> 24:56.224
Guys, Garcia has something.

24:56.225 --> 24:57.277
Ok, everybody needs to sit down

24:57.278 --> 24:58.404
'cause I'm about
to rock your world

24:58.405 --> 25:00.011
And not in a way I like to do it.

25:00.012 --> 25:03.004
I have scoured and searched
and you were totally right.

25:03.005 --> 25:04.705
This unsub has been
doing it forever.

25:04.706 --> 25:07.308
There is nowhere he hasn't
been in the last 26 years.

25:07.309 --> 25:08.709
Honestly. Every single state.

25:08.710 --> 25:11.045
Well, 48 continental. My point--

25:11.046 --> 25:13.014
He is the worst I've ever seen,

25:13.015 --> 25:14.668
And we have all seen some things.

25:14.669 --> 25:15.941
How did you connect him?

25:15.942 --> 25:17.518
Everything you said.
He's drawn to the dark.

25:17.519 --> 25:18.651
He shows up during a blackout,

25:18.652 --> 25:20.221
He robs, he kills,
he leaves a witness.

25:20.222 --> 25:21.789
How's he getting away with this?

25:21.790 --> 25:23.324
He never hits the same city twice.

25:23.325 --> 25:25.426
Except Los Angeles.

25:43.312 --> 25:44.378
I'm sending everything your way

25:44.379 --> 25:45.780
And you better load
up that printer,

25:45.781 --> 25:47.738
'cause it looks like he
started in Southern California

25:47.739 --> 25:49.884
Way back in the summer of 1984.

25:49.885 --> 25:52.153
Thank God the press
hasn't connected this.

25:52.154 --> 25:54.155
The summer Olympics were
in Los Angeles that year.

25:54.156 --> 25:55.957
So was Richard Ramirez.

25:55.958 --> 25:57.102
That's the year he started.

25:57.103 --> 25:59.730
Well, he never left.
Stayed in L.A. For a few years.

25:59.731 --> 26:01.028
Fine. I'll look into it.

26:01.029 --> 26:03.650
It appears our unsub
started that summer

26:03.651 --> 26:05.013
During a blackout in San Diego.

26:05.014 --> 26:06.405
From there he went
to orange county.

26:06.406 --> 26:08.369
After that he ended
up in Los Angeles

26:08.370 --> 26:09.904
And then worked his
way up the coast.

26:09.905 --> 26:11.431
Why did he come back?

26:11.432 --> 26:13.174
And why now?

26:14.042 --> 26:15.798
It's gonna be hot again tonight.

26:15.799 --> 26:17.375
You might be better off
sleeping in your car

26:17.376 --> 26:19.299
Or just getting the
hell out of L.A.

26:19.300 --> 26:22.885
Anything to get away from the
darkness and what happens in it.

26:22.886 --> 26:24.736
All right, we're about
to lose Arcadia.

26:24.737 --> 26:26.171
They've got that 9:00
to midnight shift.

26:26.172 --> 26:28.110
Chatsworth, you're gone
from 10:00 to 1:00.

26:28.111 --> 26:30.424
Check us out online
for a full list.

26:30.425 --> 26:33.421
We'll be here until midnight or
I guess until the lights go out.

26:33.422 --> 26:36.665
Hey, look at that.
It's a cool 99 degrees here

26:36.666 --> 26:39.473
At 99.6.

26:57.035 --> 26:59.086
Get here about 10:15?

26:59.087 --> 27:00.750
Listen, I want you to
check the neighborhood,

27:00.751 --> 27:02.308
See if there are any
surveillance cameras.

27:02.309 --> 27:04.635
They may not be working-- Kurz.

27:04.970 --> 27:06.639
Thanks.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.290
Did he leave a message?

27:10.291 --> 27:12.826
The son of a bitch
left a baby in there.

27:12.827 --> 27:13.687
Alive?

27:13.688 --> 27:15.007
Yeah.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.430
A baby?

27:19.896 --> 27:22.047
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

27:22.048 --> 27:23.071
Hey, what's up?

27:23.072 --> 27:24.472
Everyone will have power tonight.

27:24.473 --> 27:25.866
They called off the blackouts?

27:25.867 --> 27:27.698
After what happened earlier,
we can't give them that again.

27:27.699 --> 27:30.291
Thanks. Great, I'll
tell the press.

27:31.247 --> 27:34.078
We're talking over 200
houses in 26 years.

27:34.079 --> 27:36.622
When he started in San Diego,
it was all about the robberies.

27:36.623 --> 27:37.763
By the time he got
to orange county,

27:37.764 --> 27:39.064
He robbed and
assaulted his victims.

27:39.065 --> 27:41.200
First murder was in long
beach and he left a witness.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.068
He got away with it for 26 years.

27:43.069 --> 27:44.636
Why did he come back?

27:45.472 --> 27:46.805
Good news, everybody.

27:46.806 --> 27:48.207
The lights are back on.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.006
That's right.
The prince of darkness

27:50.007 --> 27:51.547
Is gonna have to
take the night off.

27:51.548 --> 27:53.949
Still no suspects in the blackout murders.

27:53.950 --> 27:55.095
But investigators believe

27:55.096 --> 27:57.327
there's a reason why he's
stayed in Los Angeles

27:57.328 --> 27:59.624
Despite the publicized
investigation.

27:59.625 --> 28:00.847
Thanks.

28:00.848 --> 28:02.934
Well, the media coverage
actually helped.

28:02.935 --> 28:04.268
Neighbors were hypervigilant.

28:04.269 --> 28:06.837
As soon as they heard the
gunfire they called the police.

28:06.838 --> 28:08.682
Did he leave a message this time?

28:08.683 --> 28:11.090
He actually left a
baby in the closet.

28:11.127 --> 28:13.028
There's got to be some
kind of message in that.

28:13.029 --> 28:15.074
He's taunting us.
He's leaving behind witnesses

28:15.075 --> 28:16.945
That are too little to help.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.532
Ok.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.176
Why them?

28:22.177 --> 28:23.465
Why now?

28:23.466 --> 28:26.737
He killed these two women
before the rolling blackouts.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.281
What is it about them?

28:28.282 --> 28:30.685
He killed them in a
busy, well-lit area.

28:30.686 --> 28:32.542
It was nothing like the others.

28:32.543 --> 28:34.698
It's, uh, shootin' Newton.

28:34.699 --> 28:37.411
People hear gunfire
down there all the time.

28:37.412 --> 28:38.945
He probably fit right in.

28:38.946 --> 28:40.492
It was in your division.

28:40.493 --> 28:42.394
Hey, he had to start somewhere.

28:42.395 --> 28:44.496
So you think it's
just a coincidence?

28:46.533 --> 28:47.933
All right, let's say it's not.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.962
What does that mean, he
wanted our attention?

28:49.963 --> 28:51.101
Well, he certainly has it.

28:51.102 --> 28:53.238
You're sure you never working
anything like this before?

28:53.239 --> 28:55.874
Trust me, this guy
makes an impression.

28:55.875 --> 28:58.110
He started his
career 26 years ago.

28:58.936 --> 29:00.638
Same as me.

29:02.882 --> 29:04.750
You think this is because of me?

29:04.751 --> 29:06.835
That all these people are
dead because of that?

29:06.836 --> 29:09.092
Two women killed in your
division, no survivors.

29:09.093 --> 29:10.823
Then a couple, leaving
the wife as a witness.

29:10.824 --> 29:12.358
Then a mother, leaving the son.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.717
Now two parents, but
a baby survives.

29:14.718 --> 29:16.955
If there's some kind of pattern,
I've never seen it before.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.990
He circled back to
L.A. for a reason.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.666
The first two murders here in L.A. county 
were close by. Long beach

29:21.667 --> 29:23.669
is on the cusp of L.A.
and orange counties.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.904
Let's look into that one.

29:26.705 --> 29:29.308
Home invasion. A husband was shot.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.243
Wife was left alive.

29:31.244 --> 29:32.297
Sounds familiar.

29:32.298 --> 29:33.410
What's the next one?

29:33.411 --> 29:36.348
After long beach, he
went to Santa Monica.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.000
Wait a minute.

29:40.001 --> 29:42.062
Spicer, do you have
family out there?

29:42.063 --> 29:43.858
Yeah, that's where I grew up.

29:44.563 --> 29:47.290
Home invasion robbery,
double homicide.

29:47.291 --> 29:49.962
Joe and Sylvia Spicer were killed.

29:49.963 --> 29:51.797
Those are my parents.

29:54.379 --> 29:55.403
It doesn't make any sense.

29:55.404 --> 29:56.769
Let me see that.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.608
They died in a car accident.
A drunk driver.

30:02.609 --> 30:04.439
Who told you that?

30:04.440 --> 30:05.951
My grandparents.

30:05.952 --> 30:08.361
I remember my grandfather
waking me up.

30:08.362 --> 30:10.298
I was sick the night they died.
I had a fever.

30:10.299 --> 30:11.980
How would I not remember
that happening to them?

30:11.981 --> 30:13.903
Maybe your grandparents
never told you, Matt.

30:13.904 --> 30:15.375
They were trying to protect you.

30:15.376 --> 30:16.789
They lied?

30:16.790 --> 30:19.324
You were the first
child he left alive.

30:19.615 --> 30:22.142
You've been all over the news.

30:22.143 --> 30:24.496
This guy knows who you are.

30:32.672 --> 30:34.506
This is crazy.

30:37.477 --> 30:40.539
Look, when Carter
said that the unsub

30:40.540 --> 30:42.377
made him watch from the closet,

30:42.378 --> 30:43.649
You flinched.

30:43.650 --> 30:44.875
And you didn't?

30:44.876 --> 30:46.752
This guy is taunting you.

30:46.753 --> 30:49.321
He left a young boy
alive and now a baby.

30:49.322 --> 30:52.024
He wants you to know it's him.

30:54.627 --> 30:56.628
How could I not know?

30:56.629 --> 30:58.764
You did. Deep down.

30:58.765 --> 31:00.573
But you went through a
major trauma as a kid.

31:00.574 --> 31:02.996
You believed the story
because it was easier.

31:02.997 --> 31:04.937
And now what?

31:04.938 --> 31:07.573
You want to make me remember
what really happened?

31:07.574 --> 31:09.036
I mean, come on, it
was 26 years ago.

31:09.037 --> 31:10.820
What good is that gonna do?

31:10.821 --> 31:13.170
It's your call.

31:22.545 --> 31:25.657
Is this, you know, like
hypnosis or something?

31:25.658 --> 31:28.627
No. I'm just gonna try
and trigger some memories

31:28.628 --> 31:30.863
By walking you through
what happened that night.

31:30.864 --> 31:31.830
All right.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.333
Should I, uh, close my eyes or...

31:34.334 --> 31:36.902
If you want. I just want
you to try and relax.

31:37.288 --> 31:39.104
Ok.

31:41.174 --> 31:43.442
Here we go.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.721
It was July.

31:45.722 --> 31:47.990
And it was hot.

31:48.681 --> 31:50.918
Were the windows open?

31:51.732 --> 31:53.653
Yeah.

31:53.820 --> 31:57.556
And, uh, there was a breeze.

31:57.557 --> 32:01.026
Good. Good. That's really good.

32:01.063 --> 32:03.128
What do you hear?

32:03.129 --> 32:05.898
Uh, nothing.

32:05.947 --> 32:07.024
Are you sure?

32:07.025 --> 32:09.335
Yeah. Yeah, my
grandfather woke me up

32:09.336 --> 32:11.103
And he told me about the accident.

32:11.104 --> 32:13.572
Slow down. Slow down.
Stay with me.

32:13.573 --> 32:16.069
There was a breeze.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.379
What did you smell?

32:21.030 --> 32:22.080
Seriously?

32:22.081 --> 32:23.949
Just try.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.118
Ok.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.322
What did you smell?

32:30.323 --> 32:32.824
What did I smell? Um...

32:33.693 --> 32:36.361
I don't know. Uh...

32:41.000 --> 32:44.503
I smelled the ocean.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.474
My mother's perfume.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.881
Spicer. What?

32:57.684 --> 32:59.484
Cigarettes?

33:00.486 --> 33:03.689
This is weird. I smell cigarettes.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.624
Did your grandfather smoke?

33:05.625 --> 33:07.125
Never.

33:07.126 --> 33:08.794
Come on, think.

33:08.795 --> 33:11.363
Who was it?

33:13.800 --> 33:16.602
Hello there.

33:21.641 --> 33:24.977
He said, "Hello there."

33:24.978 --> 33:27.487
That was his first message.

33:27.488 --> 33:29.178
What's he doing?

33:29.179 --> 33:32.684
He's...he's dragging me.

33:32.685 --> 33:35.287
I hear my baby sister crying.

33:36.132 --> 33:38.690
I hear my daddy. He's yelling.

33:38.691 --> 33:40.506
Get out of here! Don't you
touch me, you son of a--

33:43.753 --> 33:45.297
He killed my dad.

33:45.994 --> 33:48.577
Please don't hurt my babies.

33:48.578 --> 33:49.770
I can't see his face.

33:49.771 --> 33:51.570
Take me.

33:51.910 --> 33:53.538
It's too dark.

33:53.539 --> 33:55.307
She's begging him.

33:55.308 --> 33:56.441
Please don't hurt them.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.411
I can't--

33:59.412 --> 34:01.747
I couldn't see, man. I just--

34:01.748 --> 34:03.048
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

34:03.049 --> 34:04.281
Ok. Hey.

34:04.282 --> 34:05.651
No, that's enough. I'm sorry.

34:05.652 --> 34:07.085
You did enough.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.053
You're good.

34:08.054 --> 34:11.289
Ok. We cool?

34:17.331 --> 34:19.416
Ok, why is he doing this?

34:19.417 --> 34:21.560
He keeps a survivor so that
they'll never forget him,

34:21.561 --> 34:23.802
But with you, it goes
beyond that, because--

34:23.803 --> 34:26.071
He believes he turned you
into the city's hero.

34:26.072 --> 34:27.475
If your parents weren't killed,

34:27.476 --> 34:29.107
You might not have
become a Detective.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.067
Yeah, but how would he know that?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.023
It's not like he stayed in L.A.

34:31.024 --> 34:32.344
He's been all over the country.

34:32.344 --> 34:34.279
The press has talked
about your history.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.447
He's not a part of it.

34:35.447 --> 34:36.918
And he wants that recognition.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.784
He wants everyone to know
what he's done to you.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.485
How's he gonna do that?

34:40.485 --> 34:42.545
Is that your daughter?

34:45.141 --> 34:47.022
Where is she?

34:48.501 --> 34:51.797
She's with my sister at my house.

35:49.549 --> 35:51.115
Kristin? Ellie?

35:51.116 --> 35:53.014
Ellie?

36:19.316 --> 36:22.909
***

36:26.016 --> 36:28.726
As the Mercury soars,
so do our power needs.

36:28.727 --> 36:31.129
L.A. DWP is warning that
critical power levels

36:31.130 --> 36:34.128
are being reached and asks
that you keep your acus

36:34.129 --> 36:36.375
To a minimum so we can keep
the lights on in the city.

36:36.376 --> 36:37.878
Ellie's gone. So is his sister.

36:37.879 --> 36:39.240
Are they on their
way to the station?

36:39.241 --> 36:41.192
The car's still here
and the power's cut,

36:41.193 --> 36:42.529
So the unsub was definitely here.

36:42.530 --> 36:43.311
Where are you going?

36:43.312 --> 36:44.845
We're gonna try his
sister's place.

36:44.846 --> 36:46.380
This guy needs privacy.

36:46.381 --> 36:47.848
He didn't leave them
here for us to find,

36:47.849 --> 36:49.050
Which means he took
them somewhere.

36:49.051 --> 36:50.384
What's her address?

36:50.385 --> 36:51.886
1720 Sheridan.

36:51.887 --> 36:53.712
Ok, good. Ok, we'll
meet you there.

36:53.713 --> 36:56.157
I don't even know if we're
gonna find him there.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.786
What? You know what? We won't.

36:59.787 --> 37:02.560
This is about you. There's no
history at your sister's place.

37:02.561 --> 37:05.166
He probably took them to Santa
Monica to your old house.

37:24.197 --> 37:26.338
Reid, we're stuck in traffic.
The lights are out.

37:26.339 --> 37:27.606
Yeah, it's out here, too.

37:27.607 --> 37:29.741
Working off generators.
Pretty sure it's citywide.

37:31.211 --> 37:32.677
That's Morgan on the other line.

37:32.678 --> 37:33.965
We're gonna meet him
at Kristin's house.

37:33.966 --> 37:35.447
Let's get over there.

37:35.448 --> 37:36.715
With a population
of 8 million people,

37:36.716 --> 37:39.236
It's only a matter of time before
the cell phone reception goes--

37:39.237 --> 37:41.366
***

37:41.669 --> 37:42.921
Reid? Are you--

37:42.922 --> 37:45.157
Oh, great.

37:51.279 --> 37:53.187
Spicer, we really should
be waiting for backup.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.177
We don't have time. There's a
door around back. I'll check that.

38:57.023 --> 38:58.408
Where is he?

39:07.407 --> 39:10.142
Take me. Take me.

39:10.143 --> 39:11.443
Take me.

39:15.533 --> 39:16.848
Matt.

39:16.849 --> 39:19.051
Daddy, help.

39:20.053 --> 39:21.198
Drop it.

39:21.199 --> 39:23.278
You first. You first.

39:23.279 --> 39:24.556
Drop the gun!

39:24.557 --> 39:27.225
Please, daddy, listen, daddy.
Listen to him.

39:27.226 --> 39:28.727
Don't let him hurt me.

39:28.728 --> 39:31.637
Spicer, don't do it. He doesn't
kill children. You know that.

39:31.638 --> 39:33.329
He doesn't kill children.
You know that.

39:33.330 --> 39:35.072
You sure about that?

39:35.073 --> 39:37.277
Just put it down, Matt.

39:37.877 --> 39:40.844
Put the gun down or she dies.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.368
Don't give in to him, man.

39:42.369 --> 39:44.776
He's not gonna hurt you
unless you surrender.

39:44.777 --> 39:46.812
Don't do it. Don't do it.

39:46.813 --> 39:49.361
Please. Daddy, daddy,
he's squeezing me.

39:49.362 --> 39:52.317
I can't--I can't breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

39:52.318 --> 39:54.386
Put that gun down, you lose.

39:54.387 --> 39:55.916
He will kill you.

39:55.917 --> 39:58.651
Look at him.
He's nothing but a coward!

40:01.191 --> 40:03.862
Daddy, it hurts.

40:03.863 --> 40:05.230
Daddy, daddy, daddy...

40:05.231 --> 40:06.911
Ok. Ok!

40:06.912 --> 40:10.119
No! No! No, pick it up!
Pick it up!

40:10.437 --> 40:12.211
Pick it up!

40:13.246 --> 40:14.973
On your knees.

40:14.974 --> 40:17.989
Don't do it! Don't do it!

40:18.492 --> 40:20.746
That's a good boy.

40:20.747 --> 40:22.881
Hello there.

40:23.025 --> 40:24.834
Matt!

40:24.835 --> 40:27.950
Your sister grew up real pretty.

40:28.357 --> 40:32.228
Last time I saw her, she was
just an itty-bitty thing.

40:32.229 --> 40:35.292
Not as good as your mom, though.

40:35.293 --> 40:37.965
She squirms too much.

40:37.966 --> 40:39.203
Go to hell.

40:42.115 --> 40:43.237
Come on, man!

40:43.238 --> 40:44.482
Get up!

40:45.848 --> 40:47.326
Get up!

40:47.327 --> 40:49.080
Yeah, OK.

40:49.081 --> 40:51.710
Think they'll remember me now?

40:51.711 --> 40:53.111
Daddy.

40:53.112 --> 40:55.714
You've destroyed me.
Is that what you want to hear?

40:56.547 --> 40:58.316
Well, it's...

40:58.317 --> 40:59.785
Better.

41:01.245 --> 41:03.334
Promise me she'll be OK, Morgan.

41:05.992 --> 41:09.482
Go ahead, promise him.

41:12.632 --> 41:14.933
Do it and promise him!

41:16.285 --> 41:18.446
Ok. Promise me, Morgan.

41:18.447 --> 41:20.013
Ok!

41:21.867 --> 41:23.726
I promise.

41:26.242 --> 41:28.582
I love you, Ellie.

41:31.284 --> 41:33.685
No! Daddy!

41:33.686 --> 41:36.278
No! Spicer!
What is wrong with you?!

41:44.697 --> 41:46.798
Take me, please.

41:48.801 --> 41:52.304
Please take me instead! Please!

41:52.305 --> 41:53.904
No! No!

41:53.905 --> 41:55.871
Oh, God, no!

41:55.872 --> 41:58.850
No! No!

41:58.945 --> 42:00.178
Don't--

42:01.013 --> 42:04.449
I don't usually take much to kids.

42:10.774 --> 42:14.426
This one's...just...

42:14.427 --> 42:16.301
Special.

42:16.302 --> 42:18.997
We will find you, you
sick son of a bitch.

42:18.998 --> 42:20.332
Is that another promise?

42:20.333 --> 42:23.168
Please! Please, help!

42:23.169 --> 42:26.605
Ellie! Oh, my God, Ellie, no!

42:26.606 --> 42:29.520
I will find you!

42:34.589 --> 42:37.374
