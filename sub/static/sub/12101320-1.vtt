00:15.458 --> 00:17.625
- [Announcer] In 1914
it became official.

00:17.625 --> 00:19.708
President Woodrow Wilson
signed a proclamation

00:19.708 --> 00:23.292
designated Mother's
Day a national holiday.

00:23.292 --> 00:25.542
Mothers cheer across the
country as they'll be honored

00:25.542 --> 00:28.083
every year on the
second Sunday of May.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.583
Finally, the respect
they deserve.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.708
Mothers love to dress
up and prance around

00:32.708 --> 00:34.458
in their favorite hats.

00:34.458 --> 00:37.625
She can compete in the
annual Mother's Day log roll.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.375
Always a treat.

00:39.375 --> 00:44.125
Send cards, flowers,
treats, and candy to mom.

00:44.125 --> 00:47.500
Children show their love by
serving her breakfast in bed.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.792
Don't worry about the
dirty dishes kids,

00:49.792 --> 00:53.333
mom can always
wash them tomorrow.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.750
Why not have a barbecue?

00:55.750 --> 00:58.542
Let mom get outdoors
for a change.

00:58.542 --> 01:01.083
Why make her cook
over a hot stove

01:01.083 --> 01:04.667
when she could cook over
a hot grill instead.

01:04.667 --> 01:08.500
Moms give the love that
only mothers can give.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.875
They hold you in their arms
and make you feel safe.

01:11.875 --> 01:15.542
Say a prayer for your mothers
welfare on this special day.

01:15.542 --> 01:19.583
Remember, a mother
is the best thing

01:19.583 --> 01:23.125
to celebrate on Mother's Day.

01:26.208 --> 01:28.583

(cake thunks)

02:52.333 --> 02:54.708
(jazzy music)

03:15.667 --> 03:17.708
- I think we should
check places in Dumbo.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.458
- Forget it, I don't
wanna live in an area

03:19.458 --> 03:21.500
named after a flying
baby elephant.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.708
(Sarah sighs)

03:22.708 --> 03:23.917
Besides, I loved that
apartment in Tribeca.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.542
Remember, with the
elongated toilets?

03:25.542 --> 03:27.625
- Oh my God, will you stop
with the elongated toilets.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.292
What is the big deal.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.375
- You just said it,
big. They're bigger.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.542
More comfortable. Have
you ever tried one?

03:33.542 --> 03:36.583
- I don't know, it's not
something I've thought,

03:36.583 --> 03:38.667
I guess not, no.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.708
- Well don't knock
it till you try it.

03:40.708 --> 03:41.875
Your ass will thank you.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.792
- Hey, leave my ass
out of this (laughs).

03:44.792 --> 03:47.667
The other thing is
that apartment is
way over our budget.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.500
- Come on, not that much.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.875
Plus the kitchen had
fantastic granite countertops

03:51.875 --> 03:53.583
and all stainless
steel appliances.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.833
- James, you have to stop
watching House Hunters.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.583
Please listen to me.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.833
Oh no!

03:58.833 --> 04:00.417
- What? Who is it?

04:00.417 --> 04:04.750
- Uh, nobody, I just remembered
I left something at work.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.333
What?

04:07.333 --> 04:09.917
Ah, A report! I have to
go get it let's,let's go.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.625
You know what?

04:11.625 --> 04:12.833
It could wait.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.333
Sarah, what's with
you, who is that? -

04:15.333 --> 04:18.750
Nobody. Who, what do you mean?

04:18.750 --> 04:21.417
- Come on, Sarah, you keep
looking over at that woman,

04:21.417 --> 04:22.375
do you know her?

04:22.375 --> 04:24.583
- No, no, just sit like
that and don't move.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.667
- Don't turn around!

04:28.583 --> 04:30.333
- Sarah, who is it?

04:30.333 --> 04:32.750
- All right, I'll tell you.

04:33.833 --> 04:38.792
It's my mother.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.458
- Wait a minute, you told
me your mother was dead.

04:41.458 --> 04:45.667
I know. I might've stretched
the truth a little.

04:45.667 --> 04:46.542
- A little?

04:47.667 --> 04:49.458
So whose grave have
we been visiting?

04:49.458 --> 04:52.917
- Oh my God, is that you? Sarah?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.792
- Oh, God help me.

04:54.792 --> 04:55.625
- Hi honey!

04:56.792 --> 04:59.333
Oh, Dimp, get over here, you're
never gonna believe this.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.042
This is my daughter, Sarah.

05:01.042 --> 05:01.958
- Hi.

05:01.958 --> 05:02.833
- (laughs) Oh.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.625
- Are you kidding?
Is this a joke?

05:06.625 --> 05:08.333
- Oh, and this is
my fiance, Dimpy.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.500
- Oh, nice to meet you.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.958
James, this is my
mother, Theresa.

05:12.958 --> 05:14.708
- Mother Theresa.

05:14.708 --> 05:17.542
- Oh yeah, I know, it's
fine, just call me Totie.

05:17.542 --> 05:20.667
- This is my fiance James.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.125
- Nice to meet you, Dimpy.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.708
- Oh, nice to meet you Jimbo.

05:23.708 --> 05:26.667
You know, my real name is
John, but once I lost my eye

05:26.667 --> 05:28.667
everyone started
calling me Dimpy.

05:28.667 --> 05:29.542
- Dimpy?

05:29.542 --> 05:30.417
- Yeah, you know,
'cause you lost my eye.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.625
- I don't-
- yeah, you don't get it,

05:31.625 --> 05:34.792
right? A lot of people don't.
Yo, are those chocolate chip?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.500
- Okay, you know what honey,
- There's nothing to get.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.667
can you go get us
some chairs, Dim?

05:37.667 --> 05:38.500
- What does your name-

05:38.500 --> 05:40.500
- Hey Jim, why don't
you go get 'em.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.500
You're up.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.042
- Okay, oh, thank you. So sweet.

05:45.792 --> 05:48.750
- Mom, what are you doing here?

05:48.750 --> 05:50.417
- Well, can't you tell?

05:50.417 --> 05:52.917
We saw The Killers last
night at The Garden.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.875
What a show.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.000
Dimpy got wasted.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.458
- Killers! I'm the man!

05:58.458 --> 05:59.833
- No, you're not, sit
down, eat your cookie.

05:59.833 --> 06:00.958
Do you guys like The Killers?

06:00.958 --> 06:04.000
(sighs) You know what? You're
never gonna believe this

06:04.000 --> 06:07.500
but I was gonna call you today.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.792
- After four years you
were gonna call me today.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.958
- Yeah, better late
than never, right?

06:13.958 --> 06:14.875
- Sometimes never is better.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.625
- What?
- Hmm? Nothing.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.042
Last I heard you were
living in Amsterdam?

06:20.042 --> 06:21.750
- Oh, yeah, we had
to get out of there.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.833
Too easy to get high.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.750
And you know, I
gotta be careful now.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.417
In case you didn't notice
I got one in the oven.

06:29.417 --> 06:30.958
(Theresa and Dimpy laugh)

06:30.958 --> 06:33.542
And with this new baby I'm
gonna do things right this time.

06:33.542 --> 06:34.875
Oh, no offense, sweetie.

06:34.875 --> 06:38.167
- Oh, with you Mom I'm
way past being offended.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.875
- We know it's gonna be a boy

06:39.875 --> 06:43.792
so we're gonna name
it Stalin, mm-hmm.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.750
- You mean like Joseph Stalin?

06:45.750 --> 06:48.083
- Yeah, I guess so. I seen
it on the History Channel.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.042
He was like the head
of Russia or something.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.458
- He's known as one

06:51.458 --> 06:53.000
of the most murderous
dictators in history.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.208
- Yeah, whatever, but you
gotta admit it's a cool name.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.500
- Mom, don't you think
maybe you're a little old

06:59.500 --> 07:01.958
for a new baby? No
offense, mommy dearest.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.500
- Oh honey, don't you
worry, this is it, right?

07:04.500 --> 07:07.500
I mean we're gonna do
safe sex now, right Dimp?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.042
- Oh yeah, that's it.

07:09.042 --> 07:12.125
We were down at the
Greenwich Village yesterday

07:12.125 --> 07:14.750
and we went to a place
called Condomaniacs.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.917
They got all kinds
of condoms there.

07:16.917 --> 07:20.542
Glow in the dark, edible
ones, all kinds of colors.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.750
I put a green one on,
I said "Come on baby,

07:22.750 --> 07:25.042
"you're gonna do the big
Hulk tonight." (laughs)

07:25.042 --> 07:27.167
- It's more like doin' the
medium sized Hulk, honey.

07:27.167 --> 07:29.500
- Oh, come on, come
one, you loved it.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.958
You know, your mother,
she is crazy in bed.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.917
When she has an
orgasm she whistles

07:34.917 --> 07:36.917
just like this. (whistling)

07:36.917 --> 07:38.792
- Okay, that's a little
too much information.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.958
- I think it's great. You
know. She's like a tea kettle.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.208
I know when she's done.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.083
(Theresa and Dimpy laugh)

07:44.083 --> 07:45.583
So what's up with you guys?

07:45.583 --> 07:47.125
- We are looking
for a new apartment.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.917
- Oh, new digs! Fantastic!

07:49.917 --> 07:53.833
- Yes, it is. We found this
really nice place in Tribeca.

07:53.833 --> 07:57.792
Bedroom's a good size.
I'd like to paint it tan.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.792
Sort of wheat color.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.208
Sarah wants more of a
putty or a sand tone

08:02.208 --> 08:07.125
but I just think wheat
is such a calming color.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.250
- Thank you. Thank you.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.083
- For what?

08:11.083 --> 08:12.542
- I was constipated but now

08:12.542 --> 08:14.083
you're boring the
shit out of me.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.542
- I'm kidding, I'm
kidding. (laughs)

08:17.542 --> 08:18.625
- [Theresa] (laughing)
He's so funny!

08:18.625 --> 08:20.833
- Oh come on. No, but
seriously I do have to go.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.000
- Okay.
- So pardon me,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.500
I gotta go drop a friend
and drain the lizard.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.208
- (laughs) He's hilarious.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.792
Do they have a waiter?

08:29.792 --> 08:32.208
You know what, I'm just
gonna go grab a coffee okay?

08:32.208 --> 08:33.750
I'll be right back kids.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.208
- This is a joke, right?

08:41.208 --> 08:43.208
This is your idea
of a practical joke.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.792
Okay, ha, ha, ha,
ha, very funny.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.875
Now can you just pay them or
whatever and make them leave.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.083
- No joke.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.292
- I refuse to believe
that that's your mother.

08:52.292 --> 08:54.208
- I've been trying
to do that for years

08:54.208 --> 08:56.708
but unfortunately it's true.

08:56.708 --> 08:58.042
- What happened?

08:58.042 --> 09:00.750
She's like Roseanne
Barr's obnoxious sister.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.208
- I don't know, okay?

09:02.208 --> 09:05.208
All I can tell you is
growing up was hell.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.875
I was embarrassed all the time.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.000
At my high school graduation
she went streaking

09:09.000 --> 09:11.042
through the crowd with
one of her many friends.

09:11.042 --> 09:14.000
I mean, thank God I
went away to college.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.750
But we only saw each
other on holidays

09:16.750 --> 09:19.833
and after awhile we
just kinda lost touch.

09:19.833 --> 09:22.792
I mean this is the first
I've seen here in years.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.292
- Wow.

09:24.292 --> 09:27.125
- What a relief,
that's much better.

09:31.625 --> 09:32.292
So...

09:33.833 --> 09:35.625
- Excuse me, I have to make
an important phone call.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.125
- What call?

09:37.125 --> 09:39.917
- Um...To the vet about the dog.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.000
- What dog?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.625
- Didn't I tell
you? I got us a dog.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.875
- Oh, what's his name?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.750
- Um, Justin.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.417
- Oh, like Justin Bieber?

09:48.417 --> 09:50.375
- Exactly, I'm a big fan.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.917
- Really? Huh, that's
a little weird.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.667
- So is Sarah. I did
it mostly for her.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.583
- Oh that's sweet I guess.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.125
- I'll be right back.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.750
- James. James?

10:08.083 --> 10:10.208
So when are you due?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.292
- [Theresa] About two months.

10:11.292 --> 10:13.250
- Mm, you getting by all right?

10:13.250 --> 10:14.667
- Great!

10:14.667 --> 10:16.208
- I mean you and Dimpy,
are you getting by okay?

10:16.208 --> 10:20.958
- Oh, I'm getting disability
and Dimpy he's doing great too.

10:20.958 --> 10:23.333
He fixes up cars and
sells them on eBay.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.750
- Oh, that's exciting!

10:24.750 --> 10:26.833
- Yeah, and now we're
moving out to Las Vegas.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.250
He has a son that works
out there as a dealer.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.083
He's gonna put us up
for a little while.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.458
And he hooked us up
with this casino school

10:33.458 --> 10:35.792
so we're gonna learn
how to be dealers too.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.167
There's mega moolah
in that. (laughs)

10:38.167 --> 10:40.208
But how are you doing?

10:40.208 --> 10:41.125
- Fine.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.917
- Well, you know your guy,
he seems nice, Justin?

10:45.917 --> 10:47.917
- No mom, that's the dog's name.

10:47.917 --> 10:52.875
- Oh, well, you know what I
say, all men are dogs. (laughs)

10:53.167 --> 10:54.958
Speaking of dogs,
how's your father?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.000
Have you heard from him?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.208
- He died two years ago.

10:58.208 --> 11:02.958
- Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

11:02.958 --> 11:04.292
- That's okay, how
could you know?

11:04.292 --> 11:06.000
You were too busy getting
high in Amsterdam.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.167
- Oh now, Sarah-

11:07.167 --> 11:09.083
- No, you know what,
sorry I brought it up.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.083
When do you leave for Vegas?

11:10.083 --> 11:10.958
- Monday!

11:11.833 --> 11:13.208
You know honey it's a long trip

11:13.208 --> 11:16.000
and we're just a
little short on cash.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.208
- How much?

11:17.208 --> 11:18.958
- Now you know this
is just a loan.

11:18.958 --> 11:20.125
- How much?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.333
- I don't know, I mean
what do you think?

11:22.333 --> 11:25.042
I mean how much do you think-

11:25.042 --> 11:27.167
- I've got $150.

11:28.542 --> 11:31.375
- Do you maybe have
your checkbook on you?

11:31.375 --> 11:33.208
- No mom, that's what I have.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.875
- Okay, okay, no this
is great, thanks!

11:35.875 --> 11:39.042
Okay, and you know what,
as soon as I get to Vegas

11:39.042 --> 11:40.958
You know, I'm gonna
wire the money to you.

11:40.958 --> 11:42.083
- Sure, sure, okay.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.167
- Okay, and oh, you know,
after we get settled in there

11:44.167 --> 11:46.375
maybe you and, and...

11:46.375 --> 11:47.792
- James?

11:47.792 --> 11:50.417
- Yeah. You and James,
you guys should come out

11:50.417 --> 11:53.167
and you know, for
a visit, you know?

11:55.750 --> 11:57.875
I mean...Maybe around
Christmas time?

11:57.875 --> 12:00.417
- Sure, that'd be great.
Who needs a white Christmas?

12:00.417 --> 12:02.375
- Exactly. (laughs)

12:02.375 --> 12:04.167
And you know, I'm also
glad I ran into you today

12:04.167 --> 12:09.083
because tomorrow,
as you know, is...

12:09.792 --> 12:11.208
- Sunday?

12:11.208 --> 12:14.417
- (laughs) Very funny. It's
Mother's Day, all right?

12:14.417 --> 12:17.125
And well, I'm gonna go
visit your grandmother

12:17.125 --> 12:18.375
and I think that it'd be nice

12:18.375 --> 12:19.958
if you and your
fella came along.

12:19.958 --> 12:23.500
- Oh, I don't really
know about that.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.083
- Oh, come on, your grandma
would love to see you.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.083
- I don't know if
your boyfriend's okay.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.333
I found him sleeping on the
floor in the men's room.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.917
I got him up, he's washing
his face, he seems all right,

12:33.917 --> 12:34.917
but I'm not so sure.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.375
- Did you pass out again?

12:36.375 --> 12:37.917
- Again?

12:37.917 --> 12:40.208
- Oh yeah, he's got low
blood pressure or something.

12:40.208 --> 12:42.125
Sometimes he'll
go down anywhere.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.250
- Hey, I didn't pass out.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.792
I got sleepy so I
decided to lay down.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.250
- And nothing's more comfortable

12:48.250 --> 12:50.833
than a nice dirty
men's room floor?

12:50.833 --> 12:53.833
- Hey, I like to sleep
and any place will do.

12:53.833 --> 12:57.958
You know, sleep is like death
without the side effects.

12:57.958 --> 12:59.500
- What does that mean?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.375
- If you don't know
I can't explain.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.500
I love that soap
from the bathroom.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.083
Smell my hand.
- No.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.458
- Mm, everything smells
good on me, go ahead smell.

13:07.458 --> 13:08.292
- Stay away from me!

13:08.292 --> 13:09.500
- Whoa, take it easy.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.375
- Okay, you know what
we gotta get packing

13:11.375 --> 13:13.333
so we can get ready
to go but listen,

13:13.333 --> 13:16.333
it was nice to meet you...

13:16.333 --> 13:17.292
- James.

13:17.292 --> 13:18.833
- Right. Okay, don't forget.

13:18.833 --> 13:21.500
You ask him, I'm sure he'll
agree it's a good idea.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.500
- Ask me what?

13:22.500 --> 13:23.458
- Nothing.

13:23.458 --> 13:24.958
- It's a Mother's Day surprise.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.500
Sarah will tell
you all about it.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.583
- I've had enough surprises.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.375
It's more than
surprise, it's shocking.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.458
- James, calm down, we'll
talk about it later.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.417
- Okay, you talk about
it but we'll expect you.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.167
Okay, we're gonna see
you later, take care.

13:36.167 --> 13:37.958
- All right, yeah, see ya!
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.125
- Yes, you would.

13:47.542 --> 13:50.083
I don't like that word expect.
What do they expect?

13:50.083 --> 13:51.625
- (sighs) She wants us to go
to my grandmother's tomorrow

13:51.625 --> 13:53.875
to have a double
Mother's Day celebration.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.000
- No!

13:55.000 --> 13:58.250
I cannot, that's a
big expect, too much.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.250
- James, I have no
intentions of going.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.417
Do you think I want to go?

14:03.417 --> 14:06.000
- I mean do you?
No, why would you?

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
- James stop. We're not going
so just forget about it.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.542
- Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.250
Maybe we should.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.500
- Did you say maybe we should?

14:17.500 --> 14:21.542
- Yeah. Look, I gotta meet all
your family sooner or later.

14:21.542 --> 14:22.917
Why not get it over with?

14:22.917 --> 14:24.208
Ooh, that didn't sound right.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.208
- That's okay, believe
me, I understand.

14:31.417 --> 14:34.417
(muted Latin music)

14:44.208 --> 14:46.167
- Is your grandmother Spanish?

14:46.167 --> 14:47.917
- No, why?

14:47.917 --> 14:49.958
- Well it's the music.

14:49.958 --> 14:53.042
- James, are you absolutely
sure you wanna do this?

14:53.042 --> 14:55.625
- No. Maybe.

14:55.625 --> 14:56.917
No.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.083
Sure. Look, we're getting
married, I need to meet them.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.042
Let's do it.

15:01.042 --> 15:02.500
- Oh, you must be a masochist.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.250
If you thought my mother was
bad that was just a taste.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.000
Prepare yourself.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.583
If you still wanna
marry me after this

15:08.583 --> 15:11.125
I will know it's true love.

15:11.125 --> 15:14.083
- If you're trying to talk
me out of this it's working.

15:27.958 --> 15:30.375
(door knocks)

15:31.500 --> 15:35.083
- [Dorothy] It's
open, come on in.

15:35.083 --> 15:38.458
(door handle rattles)

15:38.458 --> 15:41.125
- I can't open it,
I think it's locked.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.708
- [Dorothy] No, it's not.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.333
Try harder, it's never locked.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.500
- Let me try.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.625
(doorknob rattling)
(door thumping)

15:48.625 --> 15:50.000
- [Dorothy] Come in already!

15:50.000 --> 15:51.458
What the frick is
wrong with you?

15:51.458 --> 15:54.125
- I am sorry, we're trying,
I really think it's locked.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.625
- Oh it's probably
stuck, it's not locked.

15:56.625 --> 16:01.625
- Oh, it's locked. Damn,
who locked this door?

16:03.250 --> 16:06.667
- Hi grandma.
Happy Mother's Day.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.208
- Who the hell are you?

16:08.208 --> 16:10.125
- Okay, wrong house, let's go.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.125
- Very funny grandma.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.458
It's Sarah, your granddaughter?

16:12.458 --> 16:14.125
- Really, I wouldn't know.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.625
I forgot what she looks like.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.417
I haven't seen her for years.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.167
- Don't exaggerate, I'm sorry.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.708
- Did your mother
tell you to come by?

16:20.708 --> 16:22.375
- Oh she-
I spoke to her

16:22.375 --> 16:25.250
the other day, she told
me she bumped into you.

16:25.250 --> 16:29.042
(laughs) Now that's one I
really haven't seen in years.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.042
- I know.

16:30.042 --> 16:30.750
- Who's this?

16:30.750 --> 16:32.292
- Oh, sorry!

16:32.292 --> 16:34.292
- Stop saying sorry.

16:34.292 --> 16:39.292
- What? Oh right,sor...um,this
is my fiance, James.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.250
- Some fiance, he couldn't
even open the door.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.167
- It was locked.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.375
- It was stuck.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.333
- You said-

16:46.333 --> 16:48.167
- Nevermind, who are these for?

16:48.167 --> 16:49.167
- Mom.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.333
- How come they're bigger?

16:50.333 --> 16:53.167
- Just a different kind of
flower, they grow a little big.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.458
- I'll take these.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.167
Well don't just stand there.

17:04.542 --> 17:05.375
(Latin music continues)

17:05.375 --> 17:07.125
- Where is everybody?

17:07.125 --> 17:09.167
- Lenny and Donny are
working, they'll be back

17:09.167 --> 17:10.417
in a little while.

17:10.417 --> 17:13.542
Your mother'll be here
later to bring the cake.

17:13.542 --> 17:14.375
- Oh!

17:14.375 --> 17:16.708
- So this is the fiance.

17:16.708 --> 17:18.125
- Yes, I met-

17:18.125 --> 17:20.375
- Hold it, I wanna shut the TV.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.167
I started getting into
that Telemundo stuff.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.500
I don't know why, I
can't understand a
word they're saying.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.458
But I'm crazy about the music.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.625
And the women, they are
just fantastic looking.

17:31.625 --> 17:33.750
You like 'em, huh?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.250
Well it's (laughs)-

17:35.250 --> 17:37.542
- It's okay, even though
you're getting married

17:37.542 --> 17:41.333
you can look, just don't touch.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.375
- Okay.
- Grandma, stop.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.583
- Do you have a job?

17:43.583 --> 17:45.333
- Yes I work-
- I don't care where.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.417
As long as you have a job.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.667
You want something to drink?

17:48.667 --> 17:49.542
- Sure.

17:49.542 --> 17:50.917
- Would you like Tang?

17:50.917 --> 17:54.125
- I'm not sure what that is.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.542
- What are you, un-American?

17:55.542 --> 17:59.625
That's the drink of the
astronauts! We love it!

17:59.625 --> 18:03.625
Well, Totie'll be by
with something else soon.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.583
- Is the cake here?

18:05.750 --> 18:07.917
- Oh no, not yet,
but your niece is.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.667
- Holy jump up and sit down.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.250
Look who it is?

18:13.417 --> 18:14.917
We're gonna have
a regular reunion.

18:14.917 --> 18:17.542
First Totie comes by who
I haven't seen in years

18:17.542 --> 18:18.875
and now little Sarah.

18:18.875 --> 18:20.458
- Yeah, it's been awhile.

18:20.458 --> 18:25.458
I'm sorry, I mean, I
apologize for that.

18:26.167 --> 18:26.833
How are you?

18:26.833 --> 18:27.958
- Where's the cake?

18:27.958 --> 18:30.792
- Calm down, Totie'll
be here soon.

18:30.792 --> 18:34.458
- Uncle Lenny, this
is my fiance, James.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.292
- Hey James, how they hangin'?

18:36.292 --> 18:37.917
- Very well, thank
you, how are yours.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.250
I mean, how are you?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.458
- Great, couldn't be better.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.875
- Really, I wish
I could say that.

18:41.875 --> 18:45.958
- Uncle Donny, James.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.625
- Well the prodigal
niece has returned.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.208
- Hello James the fiance.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.625
"James the Fiance" that
would make a good title.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.792
- Nice to meet you.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.458
- Hey Sarah, guess
where we're workin'?

18:57.458 --> 19:01.292
- A comic book store?

19:01.292 --> 19:03.292
- We're playing super
heroes on Times Square.

19:03.292 --> 19:06.833
- Oh! Oh, I didn't
recognize your costume.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.333
Well, check this out.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.917
(epic music)
I'm Mesh Man!

19:12.917 --> 19:15.583
And I'm That Man.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.875
- You mean Batman.

19:17.875 --> 19:18.750
(deflated music)

19:18.750 --> 19:20.417
- They were all out
of Batman costumes

19:20.417 --> 19:22.750
so I got That Man.

19:22.750 --> 19:23.917
What is That Man?

19:23.917 --> 19:27.333
That Man is like Batman,
only it's That Man.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.625
- What does that mean?

19:29.625 --> 19:31.000
- It's like-
- Forget it Donny,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.292
he doesn't understand,
he doesn't get it.

19:33.292 --> 19:34.208
- Wait a minute.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.417
- I wanted to be Spider Man

19:35.417 --> 19:36.750
but this is the
closest they had.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.500
- Donny wanted Batman.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.375
But I don't know how you
call Batman a superhero,

19:40.375 --> 19:41.667
he has no superpowers.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.500
Spider Man would kick his ass.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.583
- Batman is rich, smarter,
and better looking.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.375
- He's all about the gadgets.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.708
- I'm not gonna debate with
someone who's just wrong.

19:50.708 --> 19:54.375
Now if you'll excuse
me, I'm feeling weak

19:54.375 --> 19:57.375
and I must retire and
do more preparation.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.542
- Are you okay?

19:59.542 --> 20:02.250
- Totie's bringing cake
and he can't have none.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.208
- Don't mention that.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.000
- He has to get a pipe
up his butt tomorrow

20:05.000 --> 20:06.250
so he can't eat anything.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.792
- A pipe?

20:07.792 --> 20:10.250
- I'm going for a colonoscopy
and I'm supposed to fast

20:10.250 --> 20:11.667
a whole day before.

20:11.667 --> 20:12.833
I can't eat anything.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.625
I had to lie down in the hallway
and give myself an enema.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.583
Sort of clean house.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.000
- Wait, why the hallway?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.375
- Bed was too soft.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.375
I couldn't get the
right angle, you know?

20:22.375 --> 20:24.375
So I had to get a hard surface.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.250
- Okay, that's a little
too much information.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.458
- Well, she asked.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.708
And I have to drink
this lemon laxative mix,

20:30.708 --> 20:32.750
it's thick like oil.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.333
I have to drink a gallon of it.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.750
- Ask him where he's
getting it done.

20:36.750 --> 20:37.625
- Trenton.

20:37.625 --> 20:38.583
- Isn't that insane?

20:38.583 --> 20:39.958
- Why all the way down there?

20:39.958 --> 20:41.667
- He has a friend who's a doctor

20:41.667 --> 20:43.583
and he's giving it to him
for his birthday present.

20:43.583 --> 20:46.958
- You're getting a colonoscopy
as a birthday gift?

20:46.958 --> 20:48.750
- Well he said I'm
at that certain age

20:48.750 --> 20:50.083
I should have one done.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.083
So he's giving me one as a gift.

20:52.083 --> 20:55.083
And then after the procedure
he'd treating me to dinner.

20:55.083 --> 20:59.375
- First he cleans him
out, then he fills him up.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.708
- And you don't think
that's an unusual gift?

21:01.708 --> 21:03.958
- Not at all. He's
thinking about my health

21:03.958 --> 21:06.083
and it's the thought that counts

21:06.083 --> 21:07.917
so I think his heart
is in the right place.

21:07.917 --> 21:09.625
- I think there's something
wrong with the guy.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.458
- He's a good doctor.

21:10.458 --> 21:11.750
- Tell 'em what
he did last exam.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.083
- Don't, no, no.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.792
- While he was checking his butt

21:14.792 --> 21:16.792
he started combing Donny's
hair. That can't be right!

21:16.792 --> 21:20.125
- He said it was part, He said
it was part of the procedure.

21:20.125 --> 21:22.000
You know. To keep me calm.

21:22.000 --> 21:22.875
It makes sense doesn't it?

21:22.875 --> 21:25.458
- Oh yeah, sure.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.792
- Knock it off, come sit down.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.958
Totie'll be here
soon with the cake.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.792
(whimsical music)

21:38.500 --> 21:41.750
- So grandma, how are you doing?

21:41.750 --> 21:42.917
I mean without grandpa.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.875
- She's great. We buried
him in the backyard.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.375
- What?

21:47.375 --> 21:48.458
- Yeah, come on, look.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.792
See the big "Daddy"
sign out there?

21:58.792 --> 22:00.500
That's where we put him.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.667
- Is that even legal?

22:01.667 --> 22:03.792
- This is America,
everything's legal.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.000
- No it's not.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.833
- If you have enough money and
know the right people it is.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.875
- I thought you
had him cremated.

22:12.875 --> 22:15.667
- We did, we kept him in a
mayonnaise jar for awhile

22:15.667 --> 22:18.500
on the shelf till mom
said bury him in the yard.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.958
- I was sick of him hanging
around when he was alive.

22:20.958 --> 22:23.625
Why would I want him
around when he's dead?

22:23.625 --> 22:25.417
- I think he's
happier out there.

22:25.417 --> 22:29.000
You know with the fresh air,
the birds and everything.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.458
Still, I wish he
was here (sobs).

22:34.042 --> 22:36.958
Anyway, enough of that,
this is a celebration.

22:36.958 --> 22:39.042
It's Mother's Day
so let's celebrate!

22:39.042 --> 22:40.833
Jim, you ever had
any homemade vodka?

22:40.833 --> 22:42.208
- I don't think so.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.958
- Well come on in the
kitchen, we'll fix you up.

22:43.958 --> 22:45.875
- Ooh, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.958
James isn't much of a drinker.

22:47.958 --> 22:49.458
- Yeah, but this is pure stuff.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.833
It's the elixir of the gods.

22:51.833 --> 22:52.958
Come on!

22:52.958 --> 22:54.125
- Okay, I guess so.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.417
- Hey Donny! Get out here,
we're gonna hit the hooch!

23:03.417 --> 23:06.625
- Aren't you supposed to
fast, like not have anything?

23:06.625 --> 23:08.208
- The doctor said just liquids.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.708
I'll put a few shots in here,

23:09.708 --> 23:11.833
I'll make a colosto cocktail.

23:11.833 --> 23:14.000
- You're gonna drink
vodka in your pajamas?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.917
- They're not pajamas,
it's lounge wear.

23:15.917 --> 23:17.625
I told you that,
it's lounge wear.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.917
- Whatever, whatever.

23:21.042 --> 23:24.625
Mom, quick, cover your
ears. (loud sneeze)

23:24.625 --> 23:26.750
- Oh my God, what was that?

23:26.750 --> 23:28.042
- Believe it or not
that was a sneeze.

23:28.042 --> 23:29.958
It terrifies the
life out of grandma

23:29.958 --> 23:32.167
so she said he has to warn
everybody ahead of time.

23:32.167 --> 23:35.208
- Well it didn't work, you
scared me half to death.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.750
Next time just say
you're going to sneeze.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.792
(guitar twangs)
- Vodka time!

23:39.792 --> 23:40.625
- All right!

23:41.833 --> 23:42.708
- Careful.

23:48.917 --> 23:52.750
- Okay, before we start I
have to ask you a question.

23:53.875 --> 23:56.250
Who do you like better,
Mickey Mouse or Jesus?

23:56.250 --> 23:59.583
(bass twangs)

23:59.583 --> 24:01.792
- I like them both.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.792
- That's the right
answer. Now we can drink.

24:07.792 --> 24:09.000
(bottle thunks)

24:09.000 --> 24:10.792
- Whoa, that's a
heavy duty bottle.

24:10.792 --> 24:14.125
- This is steel, baby.
We have to use it.

24:14.125 --> 24:18.792
This is potent
stuff. Here you go.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.833
This'll put hair on your chest.

24:20.833 --> 24:22.917
Second shot, turn 'em gray.

24:22.917 --> 24:25.167
To Sarah and James
the happy couple.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.083
(bass twangs)

24:28.083 --> 24:30.042
- Oh, mommy, help me.

24:30.042 --> 24:32.792
- Good, huh?
- You feel the burn?

24:32.792 --> 24:35.125
This is the fuel for
the fire in all of us.

24:35.125 --> 24:38.000
Finish it.
(bass twangs)

24:39.667 --> 24:40.500
- Ooh.

24:44.792 --> 24:45.875
- I just hope he'll be okay,

24:45.875 --> 24:48.333
he's not used to drinking vodka.

24:48.333 --> 24:49.583
(door knocks)

24:49.583 --> 24:53.292
- Come on in, it's open.
(door creaks)

24:53.292 --> 24:55.875
- Dorth, guess what?

24:55.875 --> 25:00.042
My grandson Timmy just
got a deer at 13 years old

25:00.042 --> 25:02.667
and he shot his first deer!

25:02.667 --> 25:04.167
- That's great.

25:04.167 --> 25:06.833
You know what else
is shot? My liver.

25:06.833 --> 25:07.958
- What?

25:07.958 --> 25:10.208
- My liver, I only have 10%
of it working, I'm dying.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.250
- Is that true?

25:12.500 --> 25:15.708
- Sarah honey, hi, how are you?
Come give me a hug. (squeals)

25:15.708 --> 25:16.958
- Hi Aunt Sunny.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.042
Don't you think that's
wrong teaching a kid

25:21.042 --> 25:22.583
to kill an innocent animal?

25:22.583 --> 25:24.250
- Well you gotta thin the heard.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.250
- Yeah, but.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.833
- Who's gonna do it? You?

25:26.833 --> 25:28.875
They'll take over all
the backyards in America.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.292
If you don't kill 'em...

25:30.292 --> 25:32.750
- Are you saying
my granddaughter
couldn't kill a deer?

25:32.750 --> 25:34.375
- I don't want to kill a deer.

25:34.375 --> 25:37.000
- Oh she's talking about
an innocent animal.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.583
- Well it is.

25:38.583 --> 25:41.917
- She could kill a wolf
or a bear if she wants to.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.250
- Oh please.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.583
- This is an insane
conversation.

25:45.583 --> 25:48.583
- And she's right, it
is an innocent animal.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.792
Your grandson killed Bambi.

25:51.792 --> 25:56.042
- They're full of ticks,
did you know that?

25:56.042 --> 25:58.208
My daughter will
never walk properly

25:58.208 --> 25:59.750
because of a tick bite.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.292
She has Lyme disease.

26:01.292 --> 26:03.833
When did your daughter
ever walk properly?

26:03.833 --> 26:05.625
She's been a mess since birth.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.083
She didn't get a tick bite.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.083
You bit her.

26:08.083 --> 26:08.833
- What?

26:08.833 --> 26:10.208
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.083
- What?

26:11.083 --> 26:12.792
- You talk to low,
I didn't hear you.

26:12.792 --> 26:14.125
- I do not!

26:14.125 --> 26:16.208
- Now I can hear you
when you talk like that.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.917
- That's the way I always talk.

26:17.917 --> 26:19.083
- No it isn't.

26:19.083 --> 26:20.417
- There's something
wrong with your ears.

26:20.417 --> 26:22.292
- Oh, I know, I
have ear problems.

26:22.292 --> 26:23.708
I can't hear so well.

26:23.708 --> 26:27.042
Anyway, my daughter
will never be the same

26:27.042 --> 26:29.250
because of a deer
and a tick bite.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.917
She's not well.

26:30.917 --> 26:33.625
- Forget about the tick
bite, what about me?

26:33.625 --> 26:35.167
I'm not well.

26:35.167 --> 26:38.083
I have diabetes,
I'm worried sick.

26:38.083 --> 26:42.292
- What about my arthritis?
I'm taking all kinds of pills.

26:42.292 --> 26:44.625
Look at all of
these prescriptions.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.125
My doctor says it's starting
in my little finger.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.083
- Oh there's nothing wrong
with your little finger.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.958
And don't forget, they had
to rush me to the hospital

26:53.958 --> 26:57.250
last month because my heart
stopped and they don't know why!

26:57.250 --> 27:00.333
I have low blood potassium.

27:00.333 --> 27:03.667
I have to eat 16 bananas a day

27:03.667 --> 27:07.208
just to keep my
potassium levels normal.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.292
- No you don't,
you take tablets.

27:09.292 --> 27:12.000
- Tablets don't work. 16 a day!

27:12.000 --> 27:14.792
Ask the doctor if
you don't believe me.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.208
- You're lucky you
don't have IBS.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.833
- PBS? I don't even have cable!

27:18.833 --> 27:20.875
- Not PBS.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.417
- Hey Aunt Sunny, how come
these say Olga on here?

27:23.417 --> 27:25.000
- Oh, that's my real name.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.083
I never really liked it,

27:27.083 --> 27:29.833
it didn't suit my bright
and cheery disposition

27:29.833 --> 27:32.333
so I renamed myself Sunny.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.458
- You're kidding, right?

27:33.458 --> 27:36.167
- And don't forget
about my husband, Fred.

27:36.167 --> 27:37.833
I have to take
him everywhere now

27:37.833 --> 27:39.042
because he can't drive anymore.

27:39.042 --> 27:41.000
Be thankful you have a husband.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.917
My husband is dead.

27:42.917 --> 27:46.167
- Oh, I know he's dead,
don't rub that in my face.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.458
All your complaining
probably killed him.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.833
- Hey, Aunt Sunny, take it easy.

27:49.833 --> 27:53.750
- Get out! How dare
you say that to me?

27:53.750 --> 27:55.000
- It's a joke, I'm joking!

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
- Get out!

27:56.000 --> 27:57.375
- Sarah, tell her I'm joking.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.125
- Get out before I
smash your face in.

28:00.125 --> 28:04.083
- I'm going, I'm going.
(whimsical music)

28:05.375 --> 28:07.292
I'm late for my hairdresser
appointment anyway.

28:07.292 --> 28:08.208
Bye Sarah.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.417
- And don't you dare come back

28:09.417 --> 28:12.042
in this house again
until you apologize.

28:12.042 --> 28:15.833
Ooh, she drives me crazy! (sobs)

28:15.833 --> 28:17.750
- Don't let her get to
you, are you all right

28:17.750 --> 28:19.750
with your liver and diabetes?

28:19.750 --> 28:20.417
- Huh?

28:21.417 --> 28:23.125
Oh yeah (laughs).

28:23.125 --> 28:26.042
I just make that stuff
up to aggravate her.

28:26.042 --> 28:28.250
Oh she drives me crazy.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.375
- Just try and stay calm.

28:33.292 --> 28:34.417
- You know, we're
the only animals

28:34.417 --> 28:36.458
that drink other animals milk.

28:36.458 --> 28:38.083
Think about that.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.000
- I don't want to.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.375
- Hey Jim, can I ask you
something about underwear?

28:42.375 --> 28:43.375
- Yeah.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.417
- What kind do you wear?

28:44.417 --> 28:45.375
- Boxers.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.000
- Cotton?
- Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
- Do you like them 50%
polyester and 50% cotton?

28:49.000 --> 28:49.917
- No.

28:49.917 --> 28:51.083
- I don't think I do either.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.458
It's confusing buying underwear.

28:52.458 --> 28:55.125
Some are 50/50, some are 60/40.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.500
It's hard to find all cotton.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.875
- I feel your pain.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.917
Life can be extremely
tricky sometimes.

29:00.917 --> 29:02.458
- Ever see those boxer jockey?

29:02.458 --> 29:04.917
They're kinda half
boxer, half jockey.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.167
Kind of tight, but not so.

29:07.167 --> 29:08.417
You mind if I show
you my underwear?

29:08.417 --> 29:09.417
- Yes, I do.

29:09.417 --> 29:10.958
- I wanna see what you think.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.458
- You got apes on
your underwear.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.000
- I love apes.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.917
And fact I'm a big
"Planet of the Apes" fan.

29:16.917 --> 29:17.958
- Wear did you get those?

29:17.958 --> 29:19.917
- I don't know, mom bought 'em.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.958
She said I should
start wearing boxers.

29:21.958 --> 29:23.458
Said it's healthier
for my package.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.917
What do you think of these?

29:24.917 --> 29:26.417
- Yeah, they're good.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.958
However what makes 'em great is

29:28.958 --> 29:30.833
you got apes on your underwear.

29:30.833 --> 29:33.125
"Planet of the Apes" is
one of my favorite movies.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.500
I'd like to get myself
a pair of those.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.417
- Hey Donny, did you hear
what he said? "However".

29:37.417 --> 29:39.958
- It's funny. Who
says "however"?

29:39.958 --> 29:41.542
- These are nice.

29:41.542 --> 29:44.417
However they're a little
too long and boxy.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.375
- However some are more short.

29:47.375 --> 29:51.417
And however, not so boxy.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.125
- Okay, enough with the however.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.458
- I wonder if you
could do me a favor.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.500
Totie was supposed
to take me shopping

29:58.500 --> 30:01.458
for a pantsuit (laughs),
God knows where she is.

30:01.458 --> 30:03.250
Would you mind running me over?

30:03.250 --> 30:06.125
- Oh, yeah, I guess so,
just let me go get James.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.250
- Oh let them be.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.542
He's having such a
good time with my boys.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.292
Male bonding I
guess they call it.

30:12.292 --> 30:13.250
- I guess so.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.958
- (laughs) Sounds gay to me.

30:14.958 --> 30:16.125
- Okay.
(bass twangs)

30:16.125 --> 30:18.500
I'm just gonna to tell
him we're leaving.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.000
- Wow that feels nice, is
that nice, is that silk?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.042
- What the hell, what
is going on in here?

30:23.042 --> 30:25.000
- Look, I'm turning gray.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.167
- Nevermind that, why is
Uncle Lenny without pants

30:27.167 --> 30:29.000
and why are you
touching his underwear?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.250
- He's showing me
his apes boxers.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.375
Pretty cool, right? I love
the "Planet of the Apes".

30:33.375 --> 30:34.917
Honey, can you get
me a pair of these?

30:34.917 --> 30:38.042
- Stop touching
him! Are you okay?

30:38.042 --> 30:39.500
- Couldn't be better.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.250
- Yeah, I doubt that.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.542
Look, I'm going to the
store with grandma,

30:44.542 --> 30:46.667
we'll be back soon.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.292
- Have fun.

30:48.292 --> 30:53.000
(hisses) Attention shoppers,
I'm drinking vodka (hisses).

30:54.375 --> 30:56.292
- James are you absolutely
sure you're going to be okay?

30:56.292 --> 30:58.208
You're not used to
drinking hard liquor.

30:58.208 --> 31:00.208
- This is different.
It's homemade.

31:00.208 --> 31:03.042
It's pure nectar.
From the potato gods.

31:03.042 --> 31:04.917
- So I heard.

31:04.917 --> 31:07.083
Donny, are you sure you
should be drinking this

31:07.083 --> 31:08.583
before your colonoscopy?

31:08.583 --> 31:12.375
- It's okay. It makes the lemon
laxative stuff taste great.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.708
Also, it might clean
me out a little faster.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.208
I may have a little trouble
controlling my sphincter muscle

31:17.208 --> 31:19.542
so just in case I'm
wearing adult diapers.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.000
- Are you serious?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.250
- Wanna see?

31:22.250 --> 31:23.917
- No, God! No, stop!

31:23.917 --> 31:26.375
Why do you have to share
this information with me?

31:26.375 --> 31:27.542
- You asked.

31:27.542 --> 31:31.458
- James, are you sure
you're going to be okay.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.292
- I'm dandy.

31:34.292 --> 31:37.917
(descending bass notes)

31:41.250 --> 31:42.417
- I shouldn't leave him alone,

31:42.417 --> 31:44.375
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.375
- He'll be fine.

31:45.375 --> 31:49.292
Come one, get me to the
store before it closes.

31:51.333 --> 31:53.208
(whimsical music)

31:53.208 --> 31:56.750
- Hey Jim, you hungry? You
want some forever stew?

31:56.750 --> 31:58.167
- [James] What's that?

31:58.167 --> 32:00.250
- It's a pot of stew
that's never empty.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.583
First we eat some, then
we add some ingredients

32:02.583 --> 32:04.417
and put it back in
the refrigerator

32:04.417 --> 32:06.208
and then we take it the next day

32:06.208 --> 32:08.250
and add more
ingredients every day.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.042
- That can't be sanitary.

32:11.083 --> 32:14.458
- Who cares? It never goes away.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.583
Besides, doctors
say once in awhile

32:16.583 --> 32:18.375
a little E. Coli
is good for you.

32:18.375 --> 32:19.667
- I don't think that's true.

32:22.708 --> 32:26.292
- (lips smack) Mm.
That's good eatin'.

32:27.417 --> 32:29.417
Watch this, I used
to be a juggler.

32:29.417 --> 32:30.542
- Show him, Donny.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.000
Whoa!

32:34.000 --> 32:34.750
- Oh.
(spoon clacks)

32:34.750 --> 32:35.625
- Thanks.

32:35.625 --> 32:36.542
- No problem.

32:36.542 --> 32:37.542
- What's that supposed to mean?

32:37.542 --> 32:38.708
- What?

32:38.708 --> 32:40.458
- You said, "No problem," could
there have been a problem?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.417
- No, I gave you the spoon,
it's a figure of speech.

32:42.417 --> 32:45.000
- No, you said,'cause you said,
"No problem," which leads me

32:45.000 --> 32:47.208
to believe that maybe there
have been problems in the past.

32:47.208 --> 32:49.042
- Nah, dude, never.

32:49.042 --> 32:51.458
- Don't you disrespect
me for who I am

32:51.458 --> 32:52.625
or who I might be.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.125
- I would never do that.

32:54.125 --> 32:58.708
I just pick up spoons sometimes.

32:58.708 --> 33:01.708
- (laughing) Relax man,
we're just messing with you.

33:03.167 --> 33:04.333
Yo, relax, what's wrong?

33:05.708 --> 33:07.167
- I'm a negaholic.

33:07.167 --> 33:08.458
- What's that?

33:09.583 --> 33:12.542
- I'm addicted to
being negative.

33:12.542 --> 33:14.625
- Cheer up, it's
a beautiful day.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.458
We're sitting around
having some drinks.

33:16.458 --> 33:18.333
- Yeah, but it's
supposed to rain later

33:18.333 --> 33:19.792
and I just washed my car.

33:19.792 --> 33:21.375
- Shut up and drink.

33:26.667 --> 33:29.333
- Oh.
(men sighing)

33:32.167 --> 33:34.542
- Lenny, it's time
for the vodka dance.

33:34.542 --> 33:35.708
Show him how it's done.

33:36.792 --> 33:38.500
♪ Vodka, vodka, vodka ♪

33:38.500 --> 33:40.250

33:52.125 --> 33:54.417

33:54.417 --> 33:55.625
What is that?

33:55.625 --> 33:56.542
- Pft.

33:56.542 --> 33:59.417
- The vodka go, come

33:59.417 --> 34:00.375

34:00.375 --> 34:01.250
- The vodka goes out.
- Vodka, vodka, vodka!

34:01.250 --> 34:05.042
- Vodka. All right.
- The vodka goes...

34:07.583 --> 34:10.208
(mellow music)

34:13.292 --> 34:14.833
- I like this.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.250
- Good, okay, why don't you
try it on in the dressing room.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.667
I think they're right there.

34:18.667 --> 34:20.417
- Oh that's okay, I'll
just slip it on right here.

34:20.417 --> 34:22.250
- What, no, not here,
in the dressing room.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.792
- Why, what's the difference?

34:23.792 --> 34:25.417
- You can't just do a
strip tease right here

34:25.417 --> 34:26.333
in the middle of the store.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.167
- Nobody's gonna care
about an old woman

34:28.167 --> 34:29.667
taking off her clothes. (laughs)

34:29.667 --> 34:31.250
Unless they're some
kind of pervert.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.458
- Okay.

34:32.458 --> 34:35.500
- Oh come on, give me your hand
so I don't fall on my face.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.917
- Since you're such a big
"Planet of the Apes" fan

34:37.917 --> 34:39.917
I wonder if you've
ever seen one of these?

34:39.917 --> 34:41.417
- Oh, what's that?

34:41.417 --> 34:42.583
- Check this out.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.292
All the "Planet of the
Apes" movies right here.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.208
- You keep them in his head?

34:47.208 --> 34:48.500
How great is that?

34:48.500 --> 34:49.583
- Yeah.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.208
- Do you have the one
that Tim Burton directed?

34:51.208 --> 34:55.125
- No. Don't ever mention
that movie again.

34:55.125 --> 34:56.292
- Okay.

34:56.292 --> 34:57.708
- If you do, we'll
have to hurt you

34:57.708 --> 34:59.667
and then you'll have
to leave, understand?

34:59.667 --> 35:00.625
- Okay.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.750
- We're serious. You understand?

35:02.750 --> 35:03.833
Capiche?

35:03.833 --> 35:04.708
- Yes!
- Verstehen?

35:04.708 --> 35:06.333
- Okay. Okay.

35:07.625 --> 35:10.292
What about "Rise of the
Planet of the Apes"?

35:10.292 --> 35:11.292
- Oh that's great.

35:11.292 --> 35:14.375
- We love that one, fantastic.
- Fantastic.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.833
(bass twanging)

35:15.833 --> 35:17.458
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

35:18.792 --> 35:21.417
Excuse me, ma'am? You
cannot undress here.

35:21.417 --> 35:23.333
You have to change
in the dressing room.

35:23.333 --> 35:26.292
- Don't tell me what to do,
I'll whack you in the face.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.167
- What?

35:27.167 --> 35:27.917
- You heard me.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.333
- Don't talk to me like that.

35:29.333 --> 35:33.458
- Oh, I'm sorry, how
about take a hike, girl!

35:33.458 --> 35:34.708
Is that all right?
Is that better?

35:34.708 --> 35:36.417
- Okay, you know what?

35:36.417 --> 35:37.625
I don't get paid
enough for this.

35:37.625 --> 35:39.375
I'm gonna get the
owner of the store.

35:39.375 --> 35:41.792
- Oh, the owner, oh, I'm afraid.

35:41.792 --> 35:43.625
- Grandma, stop.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.875
- Do I have to whack
you too to get you-

35:45.875 --> 35:48.500
- All right, all right, what
seems to be the problem ma'am?

35:48.500 --> 35:49.667
- I don't have a problem.

35:49.667 --> 35:51.333
She has the problem.
- Don't touch me.

35:51.333 --> 35:52.750
- All right, all
right, that's enough.

35:52.750 --> 35:53.917
You can't touch her
like that, ma'am,

35:53.917 --> 35:56.750
and you can't stand around
with no clothes on in my store.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.292
- Why, am I turning you on?

35:58.292 --> 36:00.417
- Oh please, you're just
being vulgar now ma'am.

36:00.417 --> 36:02.667
- You want vulgar?
Look in a mirror.

36:02.667 --> 36:04.542
- Okay, all right, that's it.

36:04.542 --> 36:05.750
Police station's two blocks away

36:05.750 --> 36:06.750
don't make me call.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.417
- When I say run, run.

36:08.417 --> 36:11.333
- What, no, just put your
pants on and we'll leave.

36:11.333 --> 36:12.833
- Nobody tells me what to do.

36:12.833 --> 36:14.958
- Ma'am, ma'am, please just go.

36:14.958 --> 36:16.708
We'll forget the whole thing.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.292
- Ow! You hurt my arm.

36:18.292 --> 36:19.958
You should be
ashamed of yourself

36:19.958 --> 36:21.500
picking on a little old lady.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.333
- Ow! Jeez!
- Run!

36:24.750 --> 36:26.250
- Oh no. I'm sorry, I just-

36:26.250 --> 36:27.083
- Allright, alright!
That's it. Sheila, Sheila
call...call the police.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.917
- No, no, no, no
don't. Oh my God.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.542
- What are you in training
for, the Olympics?

36:37.542 --> 36:39.292
- Hurry up, they'll be
coming out any second.

36:39.292 --> 36:41.250
Oh my God, how did this happen?

36:41.250 --> 36:44.250
Where are they? God, God,
God, I can't go to jail!

36:44.250 --> 36:46.000
- Nobody's going
to jail. (laughs)

36:46.000 --> 36:48.500
(car alarm beeps)

36:48.500 --> 36:49.708
- Get in! Get in!

36:51.250 --> 36:52.667
- It's locked.

36:52.667 --> 36:54.625
- Oh my God, what's wrong
with you, stupid old woman?

36:54.625 --> 36:55.958
- Get in the car!
- It's locked!

36:55.958 --> 36:57.833
It's unlocked!

36:57.833 --> 36:59.917
(sighs) Oh my God.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.375
- What's wrong with you, girl?

37:01.375 --> 37:03.292
Is this some kinda payback?

37:03.292 --> 37:06.083
- Why can't I do this?
Oh my God.

37:06.083 --> 37:07.542
Do you think they're gonna
send the cops after us?

37:07.542 --> 37:08.917
They're probably getting
my license plate number

37:08.917 --> 37:10.833
as we speak, oh my God,
we have to get outta here!

37:10.833 --> 37:12.583
- Nothings gonna happen.

37:12.583 --> 37:13.750
(Sarah grunts)

37:13.750 --> 37:15.292
Here, have LifeSaver.

37:15.292 --> 37:17.417
It'll calm you down.

37:17.417 --> 37:19.417
- Calm me down? Are
they laced with Xanax?

37:19.417 --> 37:21.333
If not I don't think
they're going to help.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.000
- They're called LifeSavers.

37:25.708 --> 37:27.292
- (laughing) Oh my God.

37:27.292 --> 37:28.625
- What did we do wrong?

37:28.625 --> 37:30.875
We ran out of a store.
We didn't take anything.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.458
The owner'll be glad we're gone.

37:33.458 --> 37:34.500
He'll...eh...he'll be happy.

37:36.292 --> 37:38.000
He'll forget all about it.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.583
Now can we go home?

37:41.542 --> 37:42.417
- Okay.

37:42.417 --> 37:43.667
(mellow music)

37:43.667 --> 37:45.417
- Better?

37:45.417 --> 37:46.250
- Yes.

37:47.708 --> 37:49.542
- They're called LifeSavers.

37:57.792 --> 38:01.875
(chaotic bass music and drums)

38:06.000 --> 38:10.875
- Stand back or I'll
kill this gorilla!

38:10.875 --> 38:13.000
- Please don't! He's my husband!

38:13.000 --> 38:15.458
- Okay, okay, calm down.

38:15.458 --> 38:20.458
- You tell your ape boss
I want 50,000 in cash.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.375
- He won't go for that.

38:22.375 --> 38:26.333
- Then you're gonna have
one very dead monkey

38:26.333 --> 38:28.375
on your hands. (growls)

38:28.375 --> 38:29.458
(record scratching)
- Hey, take it easy!

38:29.458 --> 38:30.792
I keep the DVDs in there!

38:30.792 --> 38:32.792
- Oh, sorry.
(knife thunks)

38:32.792 --> 38:35.667
(whimsical music)

38:37.917 --> 38:40.042
- Do you think Totie will
be back at the house?

38:40.042 --> 38:41.667
- I don't know.

38:41.667 --> 38:45.375
I just hope the cops won't
be there when we get back.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.667
- What? You said, I thought-

38:47.667 --> 38:50.667
- (laughs) Oh, calm down.
I'm just messin' with you.

38:50.667 --> 38:51.708
(Sarah sighs)

38:51.708 --> 38:52.958
Where's your sense of humor?

38:52.958 --> 38:55.500
- Gone. I left it
at the parking lot.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
I'm all outta humor,
don't do that to me.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.625
- Okay, okay.

39:00.125 --> 39:03.000
(whimsical music)

39:08.542 --> 39:10.875
Where is everybody?

39:10.875 --> 39:12.833
(James screaming)
(water spraying)

39:12.833 --> 39:17.833
- [James] Oh God! (screaming)

39:25.208 --> 39:28.542
Oh God! Oh God, it's insanity!

39:28.542 --> 39:29.542
- Oh my God!

39:35.000 --> 39:36.792
- Oh God!
- What are you doing to him?

39:36.792 --> 39:38.500
- It's insanity!

39:38.500 --> 39:40.458
(water spraying)
What have you done to the world?

39:40.458 --> 39:42.500
You left up only the monuments!

39:42.500 --> 39:44.583
What a weird choice!

39:44.583 --> 39:46.875
- More disgusting humans!
- Get her!

39:46.875 --> 39:48.167
- Don't you dare!

39:48.167 --> 39:49.542
I will grab that hose

39:49.542 --> 39:51.208
and give you that
colonoscopy right now.

39:51.208 --> 39:54.667
(bass twangs)
- The humans are taking over!

39:54.667 --> 39:56.583
Run! Run, run! (screaming)

39:56.583 --> 39:59.458
- Oh my God. James,
are you okay?

39:59.458 --> 40:00.792
- Are you Nova?

40:00.792 --> 40:02.583
- What? Oh my God, you reek.

40:04.042 --> 40:06.458
- Nova, you came to rescue me?

40:08.167 --> 40:09.875
- Oh my God, nevermind that.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.583
We have to get you inside
before the neighbors complain.

40:12.583 --> 40:17.583
- Yes, yes, and before those
damned dirty apes come back.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.000
Aah!

40:22.500 --> 40:24.875
- Why are you wearing
Uncle Lenny's underwear?

40:24.875 --> 40:27.750
(whimsical music)

40:38.500 --> 40:41.042
(grandma sighs)

40:42.542 --> 40:45.583
- Hi Sarah, who's this?
One of your boyfriends?

40:45.583 --> 40:46.792
- Hi Aunt Sunny.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.125
- Is he okay, was
there an accident?

40:49.125 --> 40:50.750
He doesn't look so well.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.625
- He's fine, just had a
little too much to drink.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.167
- I love you, Nova.

40:55.167 --> 40:56.625
- Who's Nova?

40:56.625 --> 40:57.958
- Mm, his mother,
it's a long story.

40:57.958 --> 41:00.500
Look, I have to get
him to bed, 'kay?

41:00.500 --> 41:03.125
- Dorothy, I brought you
some of the deer meat

41:03.125 --> 41:05.000
my grandson killed
the other day.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Is it ever fresh and tender!

41:08.000 --> 41:11.125
- Chew your own meat
and choke on it.

41:11.125 --> 41:13.625
- Aw, Dorothy, I
brought this for you.

41:13.625 --> 41:14.917
I know how much you like it.

41:14.917 --> 41:17.208
- I told you not to
come hear anymore.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.167
Sarah! Just tell her to get out!

41:20.167 --> 41:22.708
- You tell her, can't you
see I have bigger problems?

41:22.708 --> 41:27.208
- That's right Sarah, just run
away just like your mother!

41:27.208 --> 41:28.833
- What are you
picking on her for?

41:28.833 --> 41:29.917
- She's my granddaughter.

41:29.917 --> 41:32.000
I can pick on her if I want to.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.208
- That doesn't
give you the right.

41:33.208 --> 41:35.125
- Yes it does, you just
take your animal flesh

41:35.125 --> 41:36.750
and get out of my house!

41:39.667 --> 41:43.208
- You're my Nova and you saved
me from those savage apes.

41:43.208 --> 41:46.667
In the movie Taylor saves
Nova, but you saved me

41:46.667 --> 41:47.667
and you're my Nova.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.250
- Okay, stop saying Nova.

41:49.250 --> 41:51.667
(hand slaps)
Snap out of it!

41:51.667 --> 41:55.875
- Now you're my Cher (laughs)
and I'm Nicholas Cage.

41:55.875 --> 41:58.000
- Lie down and pass out, please.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.042
Oh God, why do you have to
wear these stupid shoes?

42:02.042 --> 42:04.208
- Could you have worn
loafers? Something?

42:04.208 --> 42:05.708
- You're my Nova.

42:05.708 --> 42:06.958
- I thought I was Cher.

42:06.958 --> 42:10.000
- That's right, Cher.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.708
- (grunts) Okay.

42:11.708 --> 42:13.167
(James laughs)

42:13.167 --> 42:14.125
Come on, stupid shoe!

42:14.125 --> 42:16.583
- You can do it, you're my Nova!

42:16.583 --> 42:19.042
Nova, Nova, Nova, No-

42:20.167 --> 42:22.208
(Sarah grunts)

42:22.208 --> 42:23.375
I knew you could do it.

42:23.375 --> 42:26.792
You're my Nova
and my Cher. Boop.

42:26.792 --> 42:29.542
- Right. Get some sleep.

42:30.583 --> 42:32.875
- Sarah, get down
here! She's killing me!

42:32.875 --> 42:34.208
- Oh God, what now?

42:37.917 --> 42:39.625
- [Sunny] You are such
a pain in my neck!

42:39.625 --> 42:41.208
- You crazy old-
- You'll be so sorry-

42:41.208 --> 42:42.208
- I don't care if
- I'll pull every hair

42:42.208 --> 42:43.917
- you're my sister, I'll pull-
- outta your head!

42:43.917 --> 42:44.625
I hate you!

42:44.625 --> 42:46.083
- Stop it! What are you doing?

42:46.083 --> 42:48.833
Cut it out, calm down,
sit down grandma.

42:48.833 --> 42:51.083
This is insane.

42:51.083 --> 42:52.792
It's like a Jerry Springer show.

42:52.792 --> 42:55.292
You're women in your 70s
acting like children!

42:55.292 --> 42:57.083
I'm embarrassed.

42:57.083 --> 43:00.708
Two grown sisters going at
each other like crazy wildcats.

43:00.708 --> 43:02.625
- I'm only 59.

43:02.625 --> 43:03.625
- That's not true!

43:03.625 --> 43:05.250
Do you see, Sarah, how she lies?

43:05.250 --> 43:06.750
- Nevermind that.

43:06.750 --> 43:07.917
- Oh, get her out of here.

43:07.917 --> 43:09.625
Get her out! Get
her out of here!

43:09.625 --> 43:10.458
- Okay, grandma, calm down,

43:10.458 --> 43:11.917
you're going to
have a heart attack.

43:11.917 --> 43:13.708
Aunt Sunny, you have to go.

43:13.708 --> 43:14.875
- I-

43:14.875 --> 43:16.167
- No please don't say
anything, just go.

43:16.167 --> 43:18.292
- Sarah, we're sisters,
we fight all the time.

43:18.292 --> 43:19.458
That's what sisters do!

43:19.458 --> 43:21.083
- Not normal sisters.

43:21.083 --> 43:21.958
- Sarah!

43:21.958 --> 43:23.667
- Just please go.

43:23.667 --> 43:25.958
- All right, for you I will.

43:25.958 --> 43:27.292
Dorothy, see you later.

43:27.292 --> 43:28.292
- Like hell you will!

43:28.292 --> 43:31.958
I'll shoot you like your
grandson shot that deer.

43:31.958 --> 43:34.958
- You gotta thin out
the deer population.

43:34.958 --> 43:37.958
- Let's thin out the
asshole population

43:37.958 --> 43:40.208
and let's start with you!

43:41.292 --> 43:43.250
I'll kill her!

43:43.250 --> 43:45.333
- You're not killing anybody!

43:45.333 --> 43:48.792
Look at you, your blood
pressure is probably sky high.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.292
You look like a giant red beat.

43:50.292 --> 43:52.958
Oh my God, I'm gonna get
something to clean you up.

43:52.958 --> 43:56.375
Just put your head
back and try to rest.

43:56.375 --> 43:59.167
- All right. I'll
try to do that.

44:00.333 --> 44:02.042
(gentle piano music)
While I'm resting

44:02.042 --> 44:04.417
why don't you visit your father?

44:04.417 --> 44:05.042
- What'd you say?

44:06.125 --> 44:08.917
I said pay your father a visit.

44:08.917 --> 44:12.792
He could use a visitor
and tell me how he is.

44:12.792 --> 44:15.083
He fell last night
in the bathroom

44:15.083 --> 44:17.417
and he spent the
whole night there.

44:17.417 --> 44:19.000
- Is that true?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.500
- I don't know, that's what
one of the neighbors said.

44:21.500 --> 44:24.917
- Oh, just go would you please?

44:24.917 --> 44:26.333
- Okay.

44:26.333 --> 44:31.000
- Oh, in the refrigerator
I have a frozen lasagna.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.708
Why don't you bring it to him.

44:32.708 --> 44:34.333
God knows what he eats.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.208
Just go please.

44:36.208 --> 44:37.083
- Okay.

44:40.333 --> 44:41.875
(whimsical music)

44:41.875 --> 44:45.042
- Damn that Sunny. She
disrupts every living thing.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.792
(electronic music)
(guns firing)

44:54.792 --> 44:55.958
(door knocks)

44:55.958 --> 44:59.958
- Ah, why can't
they leave me alone.

45:07.750 --> 45:10.750
(woman on TV screaming)

45:10.750 --> 45:12.375
- Hey dad, how are you?

45:16.292 --> 45:18.167
- You know, I haven't
seen you in about a year.

45:18.167 --> 45:20.125
- It's only been a few months.

45:20.125 --> 45:21.333
- Yeah, whatever.

45:21.333 --> 45:22.917
My point being you
got great timing.

45:22.917 --> 45:25.250
That was the most
crucial part of the show.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.292
- Nice to see you too.

45:26.292 --> 45:27.458
What show is so important?

45:27.458 --> 45:29.042
- "Night Rider".

45:29.042 --> 45:31.042
- Are you serious? That
show with David Hasselhoff?

45:31.042 --> 45:32.875
- Otherwise known as the
best thing on television.

45:32.875 --> 45:33.792
- Listen-

45:33.792 --> 45:34.417
- What time is it?

45:34.417 --> 45:36.083
- I don't know, six?

45:36.083 --> 45:37.792
- Let me know when it's 6:30.

45:37.792 --> 45:39.333
Tony Bennett special is on.

45:39.333 --> 45:40.583
- Oh wow, are you serious?

45:40.583 --> 45:41.917
God, I love him.

45:41.917 --> 45:43.500
You know, I think
he's in his 90s.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.417
He looks great for his age.

45:45.417 --> 45:46.292
- It's all drugs.

45:46.292 --> 45:47.458
- What?

45:47.458 --> 45:48.833
- Well maybe not Tony,
he's all natural,

45:48.833 --> 45:50.417
but the rest all
do tons of drugs.

45:50.417 --> 45:54.875
You see, to be a singer
or, or a movie star,

45:54.875 --> 45:57.125
to be in that business
you can't be normal.

45:57.125 --> 45:58.333
They need to stay high.

45:58.333 --> 46:00.167
All those people are on drugs.

46:00.167 --> 46:02.250
They're not regular.
They can't be.

46:02.250 --> 46:05.250
- Speaking of not
regular, how's your head?

46:05.250 --> 46:07.000
- What are you talking about?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.292
- Grandma said you
fell and hit your head

46:08.292 --> 46:09.417
on the toilet last night.

46:09.417 --> 46:12.000
- Oh yeah, yeah, I forgot.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.417
- How could you forget?

46:13.417 --> 46:15.375
Grandma said you fell and
were stuck there all night.

46:15.375 --> 46:16.583
- Wrong. Just a few minutes.

46:16.583 --> 46:18.333
I had a little
trouble getting up.

46:18.333 --> 46:19.542
- Well she said you
couldn't get up.

46:19.542 --> 46:22.125
- Grandma exaggerates
things, you know that.

46:22.125 --> 46:24.375
- Okay, are you okay?
Did you get hurt?

46:24.375 --> 46:26.125
- Yeah, I think I
got a little bump.

46:26.125 --> 46:27.458
- What happened?

46:27.458 --> 46:29.375
- I don't know,
I got up to flush

46:29.375 --> 46:31.375
and then I slipped and fell.

46:31.375 --> 46:32.958
You know what I need?

46:32.958 --> 46:35.833
I need one of those
automatic flushing toilets

46:35.833 --> 46:37.250
like in a public bathroom.

46:37.250 --> 46:39.500
You know, you take
a dump and swoosh,

46:40.417 --> 46:41.625
it goes right down.

46:41.625 --> 46:46.250
No waiting, I don't have to
reach it just flushes as you go.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.083
- Beautiful.
- Oh my God,

46:48.083 --> 46:51.000
what is with you guys
and your obsession with toilets?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.167
- And maybe after, it squirts
a nice burst of cologne.

46:54.167 --> 46:55.583
- All right, that's enough.
- Nah, I'm just sayin'-

46:55.583 --> 46:57.333
- Nah I'm just sayin'-
- It's not a bad idea.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.167
- That's enough.

46:58.167 --> 47:00.000
You know what you need?

47:00.000 --> 47:00.875
- What's that?

47:00.875 --> 47:02.125
- One of those medical
alert necklaces

47:02.125 --> 47:03.333
you wear around your neck-

47:03.333 --> 47:05.500
- No, hey, hey, I know what
they are. I know what they are.

47:05.500 --> 47:08.000
No, I'm not wearing a necklace.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.125
That's for little old ladies.

47:10.125 --> 47:11.292
- It's not just for old ladies.

47:11.292 --> 47:13.083
- I seen the commercial
like everyone else.

47:13.083 --> 47:17.250
The old broad screams "I've
fallen, I can't get up!"

47:17.250 --> 47:19.875
I say, "Stay down
you pain in the ass!

47:19.875 --> 47:21.292
"Who cares about you
anyway?" (laughs)

47:21.292 --> 47:23.500
- Why do have to get so
nasty about a commercial?

47:23.500 --> 47:25.917
- I'm not getting
nasty. What I'm joking.

47:25.917 --> 47:28.125
I'd help the old broad
out push come to shove.

47:28.125 --> 47:31.333
- All right, well listen,
I brought you some lasagna.

47:31.333 --> 47:32.208
- Who made it?

47:32.208 --> 47:33.042
- Grandma.

47:33.042 --> 47:34.458
- Ah, keep it, I'm
not eating that.

47:34.458 --> 47:35.708
- Why not?

47:35.708 --> 47:36.667
- Because it tastes
like fried armpits.

47:36.667 --> 47:38.375
- All right, well you
have to eat something.

47:38.375 --> 47:39.208
- I eat.

47:40.375 --> 47:42.583
I eat stuff that
tastes like food.

47:42.583 --> 47:44.625
- Listen, why don't you come

47:44.625 --> 47:46.458
to the party today at grandma's?

47:46.458 --> 47:47.708
- What's it her
birthday or something?

47:47.708 --> 47:49.417
- No it's Mother's Day.

47:49.417 --> 47:51.292
Her birthday was
like two months ago.

47:51.292 --> 47:52.458
- Yeah, I thought
it was kinda soon.

47:52.458 --> 47:54.000
- How could you think it was-

47:54.000 --> 47:56.042
- No, no, no, don't start.

47:56.042 --> 47:57.292
- No, I'm just saying-

47:57.292 --> 48:00.208
- No, no, woo, woo,
don't start with me.

48:00.208 --> 48:01.917
- All right, all
right, calm down.

48:03.042 --> 48:05.625
- And it's Mother's
Day, not Grandma's Day.

48:05.625 --> 48:07.458
What's she celebrating it for?

48:07.458 --> 48:08.917
- She's a mother too.

48:08.917 --> 48:11.500
- (laughs) Well it's
one or the other.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.667
I'd go to the Grandma Day party.

48:13.667 --> 48:14.667
Is there such a thing?

48:14.667 --> 48:15.583
- I don't know, look-

48:15.583 --> 48:16.625
- Is it 6:30 yet?

48:16.625 --> 48:17.750
- No.

48:17.750 --> 48:19.083
- Why don't you stay and
watch the concert with me?

48:19.083 --> 48:19.500
Come on.

48:19.500 --> 48:20.583
- No thanks.

48:20.583 --> 48:22.542
I'm gonna put this in
the freezer just in case.

48:22.542 --> 48:24.083
- Just in case what?

48:24.083 --> 48:25.625
I wanna poison somebody?

48:25.625 --> 48:28.625
Here, have some
lasagna. (groans)

48:28.625 --> 48:30.583
- Hey, try and come
to the party today.

48:30.583 --> 48:32.250
It would mean a lot to grandma.

48:33.250 --> 48:35.250
- Can I bring a date?

48:35.250 --> 48:36.292
- Who?

48:37.375 --> 48:40.083
Nevermind, sure why not.

48:40.083 --> 48:44.250
- Huh, maybe I'll come.
But don't count on me.

48:44.250 --> 48:47.250
'Kay. Well, enjoy Tony.

48:48.625 --> 48:50.167
Hope he gets his heart back.

48:51.250 --> 48:53.292
- (laughs) What?

48:54.333 --> 48:56.542
- In San Francisco?

48:56.542 --> 49:00.292
- Ah. (laughs) Not funny.

49:00.292 --> 49:03.042
- Uh-huh.
(horn whomps)

49:03.042 --> 49:05.625
(cheerful music)

49:11.125 --> 49:12.375
Where is everybody?

49:12.375 --> 49:14.000
- Totie's on her way

49:14.000 --> 49:16.083
and the rest of them
are sleeping it off.

49:18.208 --> 49:20.000
So is he coming?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.667
- Maybe, he's not sure.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.458
- Oh, he's gotta get out more.

49:23.458 --> 49:26.750
- Well, maybe it's
better he doesn't come.

49:26.750 --> 49:29.417
I told my mother he was dead.

49:29.417 --> 49:32.000
- (laughs) Oh,
then he has to come

49:32.000 --> 49:35.167
so I could see the
look on Totie's face.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.333
Oh.

49:37.458 --> 49:39.292
- Did Totie come
with the cake yet?

49:39.292 --> 49:42.583
- Calm down. Totie's on the way.

49:42.583 --> 49:45.792
- Hot damn. I'm gonna
take a quick shower.

49:45.792 --> 49:47.458
- Oh, why don't you
let me hose you down.

49:47.458 --> 49:49.042
- Nah, that's all right.

49:49.042 --> 49:51.208
Come on Sarah, we were just
playing "Planet of the Apes".

49:51.208 --> 49:54.167
Yeah, well now James is going
to have an ape of a headache.

49:54.167 --> 49:57.500
- Knock, knock! We're here!

49:57.500 --> 49:59.375
- Well finally, at last!

49:59.375 --> 50:02.292
- Aah, Happy Mother's Day ma!

50:02.292 --> 50:05.667
Oh, you look great,
mama, how you feelin'?

50:05.667 --> 50:07.125
- Okay.

50:07.125 --> 50:08.708
- Oh, Lenny, it's been awhile!

50:10.292 --> 50:12.125
- I see you're still with him?

50:13.042 --> 50:15.083
- Oh, how you doin' ma?

50:15.083 --> 50:16.667
- Please tell me
that's the cake.

50:16.667 --> 50:18.208
- Yes, yes, that's the cake.

50:18.208 --> 50:20.208
My God, you're like a
crack addict for cake.

50:20.208 --> 50:22.625
- Hallelujah, the cake is here!

50:22.625 --> 50:24.250
Where have you been?

50:24.250 --> 50:26.083
We've been waiting
for you all day.

50:26.083 --> 50:28.708
- Well I'm sorry, I
lost track of time.

50:28.708 --> 50:30.500
- You always lose track of time.

50:30.500 --> 50:32.125
Why don't you wear a watch?

50:32.125 --> 50:33.250
- They don't work!

50:33.250 --> 50:35.458
I got too much
electricity in my body.

50:35.458 --> 50:37.208
It makes the watch
run backwards.

50:37.208 --> 50:39.500
I think because I ate too
many pickles as a kid.

50:39.500 --> 50:42.208
- More like you dropped
too much acid as a teen.

50:43.625 --> 50:46.500
- Happy Mother's Day,
ma. From both of us.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.542
- Don't call me ma.

50:48.542 --> 50:50.708
What kinda cake is that?

50:50.708 --> 50:53.167
- Delicious, that's what kind.

50:53.167 --> 50:55.542
- It says, "Happy
Mother's Day, Totie".

50:55.542 --> 50:56.750
What about me?

50:56.750 --> 50:58.792
- Right there, right there, see?

50:58.792 --> 51:01.667
- Why isn't it written
out nice like hers?

51:01.667 --> 51:04.667
- No, they...they
screwed up at the bakery.

51:04.667 --> 51:06.250
They forgot to put
your name on it.

51:06.250 --> 51:08.250
- I think you screwed up,
you forgot to tell them.

51:08.250 --> 51:09.833
- No, it wasn't like that!

51:09.833 --> 51:12.125
We noticed it in
the car, all right?

51:12.125 --> 51:13.375
So I made a little note.

51:13.375 --> 51:15.667
Look, I used a pink
sharpie. Cute, huh?

51:15.667 --> 51:19.250
Here, keep it as a remembrance.

51:19.250 --> 51:22.292
- I'm touched. I'll save
it for future reference.

51:22.292 --> 51:23.583
- All right, I wanna sit down.

51:23.583 --> 51:25.625
Take a seat, have a
little breather. Hoo.

51:25.625 --> 51:29.458
- Holy moly, how many babies
have you got in there?

51:29.458 --> 51:31.250
You're gigantic?

51:31.250 --> 51:33.792
- Okay ma, come on, you
know this isn't easy for me.

51:33.792 --> 51:35.583
- Hey, we found out
what it's gonna be.

51:35.583 --> 51:38.458
- Let me guess. A baby rhino.

51:38.458 --> 51:40.292
- Oh, okay ma,
now that's enough.

51:40.292 --> 51:42.625
All right, like
we're havin' a boy.

51:42.625 --> 51:44.958
- I'm really happy
for you. (lips smack)

51:44.958 --> 51:46.792
- I can't wait to
smell it's head.

51:46.792 --> 51:48.417
- What?

51:48.417 --> 51:51.375
- A baby's head has the most
wonderful freshest smell.

51:51.375 --> 51:52.708
- That's sick.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.667
- No it's not, it's
perfectly natural.

51:54.667 --> 51:56.792
And addictive, it's like a drug.

51:56.792 --> 51:59.708
I heard about this woman
at a childcare center,

51:59.708 --> 52:01.667
she got arrested
for begging mothers

52:01.667 --> 52:03.292
to smell their babies' heads.

52:03.292 --> 52:05.292
- 'Kay, honey, that's enough
about the babies' heads.

52:05.292 --> 52:07.167
You're upsetting everyone.

52:07.167 --> 52:09.708
(horn whomping)

52:11.333 --> 52:13.875
(chaotic music)

52:42.833 --> 52:45.500
(James grunts)

52:52.917 --> 52:55.667
(water rushing)

53:04.708 --> 53:07.542
(bottles rattling)

53:13.792 --> 53:17.417
(alarming electronic tones)

53:17.417 --> 53:22.417
(James screams)
(horn whomping)

53:30.375 --> 53:32.292
- Oh Mother of God, help us.

53:33.542 --> 53:36.042
(footsteps approaching)
- What was that?

53:36.042 --> 53:38.250
- I think dad's
ghost is haunting us.

53:39.542 --> 53:42.250
Dad, I'm sorry. I'll bring
you back in the house.

53:42.250 --> 53:46.292
- Wow, you look like something
out of a fetish porn video.

53:46.292 --> 53:47.542
Not that I would know.

53:47.542 --> 53:49.875
- How come everybody in this
house is always getting naked?

53:49.875 --> 53:52.292
Uncle Donny, please
put some clothes on!

53:53.917 --> 53:54.792
- Where' the vodka?

53:54.792 --> 53:55.958
- What?

53:55.958 --> 53:57.708
- Vodka, the vodka,
I need the vodka.

54:02.792 --> 54:05.708
(James gargles)

54:05.708 --> 54:07.292
(James spits)

54:07.292 --> 54:08.583
- Hey, that's precious
stuff, you're wasting it!

54:08.583 --> 54:09.708
- What is wrong with you?

54:09.708 --> 54:10.583
- Fungal cream.
(bass twangs)

54:10.583 --> 54:11.750
- What?

54:11.750 --> 54:14.792
- I brushed my teeth
with anti-fungal cream.

54:14.792 --> 54:18.583
- Oh, that must be
mine. I had a condition.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.583
That really fixed me up.

54:20.583 --> 54:23.417
(James retching)

54:28.417 --> 54:30.625
- Oh, my mouth tastes like
the bottom of a bird cage.

54:30.625 --> 54:31.792
I think I'm dying.

54:31.792 --> 54:34.833
- Chill out, you're just
hungover, that's all.

54:34.833 --> 54:37.542
And you nearly cleared
us out of vodka.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.542
- Okay, you know what, Donny
go put some clothes on.

54:39.542 --> 54:41.625
I feel like I'm at a low
budget Chippendale's.

54:41.625 --> 54:43.458
- Yeah Donny, go
put your jammies on.

54:43.458 --> 54:45.292
- I told you it's lounge wear.

54:46.083 --> 54:47.375
Lounge wear.

54:48.958 --> 54:51.458
- Oh God, my head is killing me.

54:51.458 --> 54:52.625
- Aw, come over hear sweetie.

54:52.625 --> 54:54.458
We have the perfect
cure, come on.

54:56.958 --> 54:59.458
There you go, bring
it in, all right.

54:59.458 --> 55:01.583
We know just the cure.

55:03.458 --> 55:07.500
(exotic meditation music)

55:07.500 --> 55:08.917
Give me your hand.

55:11.500 --> 55:14.917
Close your eyes, relax.

55:14.917 --> 55:17.500
Imagine you're on the beach.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.792
You can hear the waves
crashing on the shore.

55:20.917 --> 55:23.583
(waves whooshing)
(Dimpy whooshing)

55:23.583 --> 55:25.667
- He doesn't like the beach.

55:25.667 --> 55:29.333
- And it's beautiful
and peaceful.

55:30.625 --> 55:33.667
And there's seagulls, they're
soaring over the water.

55:33.667 --> 55:36.125
(Dimpy squealing)

55:36.125 --> 55:38.333
- He hates the beach.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.917
Nope, doesn't like
his head rubbed.

55:40.917 --> 55:44.792
- And it's relaxing.
And so peaceful.

55:44.792 --> 55:46.375
(Dimpy squealing)
(record scratches)

55:46.375 --> 55:48.708
- You know what?
It's not so peaceful.

55:50.125 --> 55:51.958
What happened to your patch?
You said you lost your eye.

55:51.958 --> 55:54.708
- No, I lost the patch,
nothing wrong with my eye.

55:54.708 --> 55:55.833
- But you-

55:55.833 --> 55:57.917
- I'm fine. I just
thought it would be cool

55:57.917 --> 56:00.083
to go to New York City
and wear an eye patch.

56:00.083 --> 56:03.083
- So you just lied
about losing your eye?

56:03.083 --> 56:04.750
- I didn't lie, I made it up.

56:04.750 --> 56:05.875
- Same thing.

56:05.875 --> 56:07.542
- (laughs) No, you just
don't know the difference.

56:07.542 --> 56:08.750
- That's absurd,
there's no difference.

56:08.750 --> 56:09.708
- James.

56:09.708 --> 56:12.083
- But-
- James, just let it be.

56:12.083 --> 56:14.458
- Yeah Jimbo, take a
lesson from the Beatles.

56:14.458 --> 56:15.875
- What?

56:15.875 --> 56:19.042
- Skip it. You don't get a
lotta stuff, do you James?

56:19.042 --> 56:20.542
- Can everyone stop talking?

56:20.542 --> 56:21.833
Okay, you're ruining the moment.

56:21.833 --> 56:24.083
- What moment?
There is no moment.

56:24.083 --> 56:27.125
There was never a moment.

56:27.125 --> 56:28.958
(door knocks)

56:28.958 --> 56:30.958
- [Dorothy] Come in, it's open!

56:30.958 --> 56:33.042
- It's right in
this way, step up.

56:33.042 --> 56:35.750
It's kind of an old house.
(horn whomps)

56:35.750 --> 56:40.750
- Hey! The kid told me there
was a party, so here I am.

56:41.583 --> 56:45.125
Dorothy, Happy Mother's Day.

56:45.125 --> 56:47.750
- If you didn't notice,
that's for the wrong holiday.

56:47.750 --> 56:49.042
Do you know what day it is?

56:49.042 --> 56:50.583
Do you know what year it is?

56:50.583 --> 56:53.667
- Yeah, see I meant to
bring it on Valentine's Day

56:53.667 --> 56:55.583
but I never made it.

56:55.583 --> 56:56.958
But it's all still good.

56:56.958 --> 56:59.250
And look, see, it's a heart!

56:59.250 --> 57:02.042
See it means love.

57:02.042 --> 57:04.542
- You guys never get it right.

57:04.542 --> 57:08.167
- Oh, surprise, surprise, I
guess it's double Mother's Day.

57:08.167 --> 57:11.625
- You said he was
dead. You lied to me!

57:11.625 --> 57:14.667
- Oh, no, I didn't,
I made it up.

57:14.667 --> 57:16.625
Ask Dimpy, there's a difference.

57:16.625 --> 57:19.458
- Oh, you made it up that I
was dead. That's, that's nice.

57:20.875 --> 57:22.042
I thought you were in Amsterdam.

57:22.042 --> 57:23.583
- Hi, Rog.

57:23.583 --> 57:25.250
I was, I just got
back couple days ago.

57:25.250 --> 57:27.500
- What happen, they
run outta hash?

57:27.500 --> 57:29.167
- Cut it out, Rodger.

57:29.167 --> 57:31.792
If you're gonna keep up with
that crap you'll have to leave.

57:31.792 --> 57:32.958
- Okay, okay.

57:32.958 --> 57:35.792
What's with that
tall drink of water?

57:35.792 --> 57:37.583
- Oh, thanks for
asking, Dorothy.

57:37.583 --> 57:39.625
This beautiful creature here

57:39.625 --> 57:42.500
on my arm is my girlfriend, Oda.

57:42.500 --> 57:45.208
- Oder? That's not a
name, that's a smell.

57:45.208 --> 57:49.167
- It's not Oder, it's Oda,
it means to praise God.

57:49.167 --> 57:50.958
- Nice, well this is
my boyfriend Dimpy.

57:50.958 --> 57:52.167
Dimpy.

57:52.167 --> 57:54.625
Means good in bed, something
you would know nothin' about.

57:54.625 --> 57:57.000
- Yeah, well I get no
complaints from Oda.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.875
- I wouldn't complain
either if I got paid too.

57:59.875 --> 58:04.167
- I'm not getting paid.
(speaking in Turkish language)

58:04.167 --> 58:06.667
Rodger, I'll wait for
you right there, okay?

58:06.667 --> 58:09.292
- All right, baby.
(lips smacking)

58:09.292 --> 58:10.167
I'll miss you.

58:13.125 --> 58:14.333
- What did she say?

58:14.333 --> 58:16.000
- She said she hopes you
have a beautiful baby.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.667
- It didn't sound like that.

58:17.667 --> 58:19.958
- I know, what
language was that?'

58:19.958 --> 58:21.083
- I think it was Klingon.

58:21.083 --> 58:22.333
- Oh, shut up Dimp.

58:22.333 --> 58:26.125
- You think maybe we could be
civil to each other just once?

58:26.125 --> 58:27.292
- I don't think so.

58:27.292 --> 58:30.000
- God, could this be
any more uncomfortable.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.542
- This is not uncomfortable.

58:32.292 --> 58:33.958
We're all adults here.

58:33.958 --> 58:35.792
These two got
married 25 years ago

58:35.792 --> 58:37.125
and then they got a divorce.

58:37.125 --> 58:39.583
That's normal. That
happens to a lotta people.

58:39.583 --> 58:42.833
Now they haven't seen
each other in four years.

58:42.833 --> 58:46.125
Totie has a boyfriend,
Rodger has girlfriend.

58:46.125 --> 58:48.708
Rodger came here, he didn't
know he was gonna see Totie.

58:48.708 --> 58:50.250
He certainly didn't
know she was pregnant.

58:50.250 --> 58:52.125
Hell, she thought he was dead.

58:54.125 --> 58:55.292
You know, you're right.

58:55.292 --> 58:58.167
This is...this is
beyond uncomfortable.

58:58.167 --> 59:01.750
Downright awkward and
pretty freakin' dangerous.

59:04.583 --> 59:07.708
(footsteps retreating)

59:09.250 --> 59:12.875
- Well it's Mother's Day,
isn't that wonderful?

59:12.875 --> 59:16.250
You know, it's also the
sixth month anniversary

59:16.250 --> 59:19.000
of your father's death.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.958
Why don't we all go outside

59:20.958 --> 59:23.750
and say a few words in
the backyard in his honor?

59:25.083 --> 59:25.917
- Okay.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.083
(upbeat jazzy music)

59:31.750 --> 59:32.625
- Oh jeez.

59:34.042 --> 59:37.042
(Totie grunts)

59:37.042 --> 59:37.917
- Come on.

59:54.042 --> 59:56.625
Well, here we are, Charles.

59:56.625 --> 59:59.833
The whole family is
gathered together.

59:59.833 --> 1:00:02.000
Oh, plus a few extras.

1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:03.875
Sarah has a fiance.

1:00:03.875 --> 1:00:08.292
He's a little delicate and
he can't hold his liquor.

1:00:08.292 --> 1:00:10.292
- Yeah, and he talks funny.

1:00:10.292 --> 1:00:13.333
He says, "however",
but he's okay.

1:00:13.333 --> 1:00:17.250
- You were always a son of
a bitch, but I miss you.

1:00:18.167 --> 1:00:19.917
- [Group] Yeah, yeah.

1:00:19.917 --> 1:00:21.875
- I kinda miss you, yeah.

1:00:21.875 --> 1:00:25.167
- Hey maybe we should
sing his favorite song.

1:00:25.167 --> 1:00:26.125
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:00:26.125 --> 1:00:27.333
- Oh no, not that song.

1:00:27.333 --> 1:00:30.083
- Yes, let's do
that! Let's do it.

1:00:30.083 --> 1:00:30.958
- Okay.

(Dorothy laughs)
(group claps)

1:01:12.917 --> 1:01:14.708
- Kind of a morbid song.

1:01:14.708 --> 1:01:17.250
Well, it's a song about reality.

1:01:17.250 --> 1:01:21.000
And we like to celebrate
the reality of life.

1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.375
- That was a song about death.

1:01:22.375 --> 1:01:25.292
- That's the bad thing about
life, it ends in death.

1:01:25.292 --> 1:01:26.750
- It's a shame we
don't have anyone

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:28.750
to carry on the family name.

1:01:28.750 --> 1:01:30.292
I can't depend on you or Lenny.

1:01:30.292 --> 1:01:32.458
- Don't say that mom,
it can still happen.

1:01:32.458 --> 1:01:34.542
- Not in your wildest
dreams (laughs).

1:01:34.542 --> 1:01:38.167
- What about me? Did you
forget I got a dude down here.

1:01:38.167 --> 1:01:41.542
You know, cookin', he's
gonna be kickin' out any day.

1:01:41.542 --> 1:01:43.458
- Yeah, I forgot.
Took you long enough.

1:01:43.458 --> 1:01:45.750
It's about time you have
a child of your own.

1:01:45.750 --> 1:01:47.000
- What does that mean?

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.250
- (gasps) It's just, you know,

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:51.792
your grandma's silly
sense of humor!

1:01:51.792 --> 1:01:53.000
Just shut your trap.

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.292
- What did I say?

1:01:54.292 --> 1:01:56.042
I mean it's no big news.

1:01:56.042 --> 1:01:57.458
- What are you talking about?

1:01:57.458 --> 1:01:59.250
- Don't tell me you
didn't tell her.

1:01:59.250 --> 1:02:01.208
- This is not the
time or place, ma.

1:02:01.208 --> 1:02:03.000
- You mean she doesn't
know anything about it?

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.083
- Told me what?

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:10.167
- Sarah, I...I should, I mean...

1:02:11.083 --> 1:02:12.792
I just, I just...

1:02:12.792 --> 1:02:14.333
- You're adopted!

1:02:14.333 --> 1:02:15.208
- What?

1:02:15.208 --> 1:02:16.833
- [Group] What?

1:02:16.833 --> 1:02:18.958
- Can't belief you
haven't told her.

1:02:18.958 --> 1:02:21.167
- Wow, I didn't know that.

1:02:21.167 --> 1:02:23.250
- I sure as hell
didn't know that.

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:24.500
- I didn't know that.

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:25.792
(bass twangs)
- Wait a minute.

1:02:25.792 --> 1:02:27.333
How did you not know about that?

1:02:27.333 --> 1:02:29.083
- I don't know
how I didn't know.

1:02:29.083 --> 1:02:30.833
I was on the road a lot.

1:02:30.833 --> 1:02:33.208
Somehow she faked it!

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:35.042
- Well that wasn't the
only thing I faked.

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:37.333
- [Dorothy] That's enough Totie,
this is serious stuff here.

1:02:37.333 --> 1:02:41.917
- Look, Sarah, I've...I've
been meaning to tell you.

1:02:41.917 --> 1:02:45.958
I just, I don't know.

1:02:45.958 --> 1:02:48.458
Time just slipped away.

1:02:49.417 --> 1:02:54.417
- (laughing) Yeah.

1:02:57.958 --> 1:03:00.375
- Are you all right?

1:03:00.375 --> 1:03:01.958
Honey, you're kinda scaring us.

1:03:01.958 --> 1:03:03.125
Are you okay?

1:03:03.125 --> 1:03:05.625
- (gasping) All
right? I'm fantastic!

1:03:05.625 --> 1:03:08.250
I've, I've, I've
never been better!

1:03:08.250 --> 1:03:11.125
This explains
everything! I can leave!

1:03:11.125 --> 1:03:12.875
I don't have to be a part

1:03:12.875 --> 1:03:15.125
of this whacked
out family anymore!

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:16.500
Let's go, James!

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:18.292
- No, no, no, Sarah, Sarah,
come with me, let's talk.

1:03:18.292 --> 1:03:20.250
Please can we just
talk about this?

1:03:20.250 --> 1:03:22.125
- Goodbye, Mommy dearest.

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:25.458
- What's going on?

1:03:25.458 --> 1:03:28.333
- Okay, well this is all your
fault you big blabbermouth!

1:03:30.417 --> 1:03:32.333
You happy now? Huh?

1:03:32.333 --> 1:03:34.333
Is this what you wanted?

1:03:34.333 --> 1:03:36.417
Sarah, wait! Wait!

1:03:38.875 --> 1:03:42.458
Wait, wait, Sarah, please
just let me explain!

1:03:43.583 --> 1:03:47.875
- There is nothing
to explain, Theresa.

1:03:47.875 --> 1:03:50.875
- Please, will you just
listen to me for one second?

1:03:50.875 --> 1:03:52.542
Just listen, please.

1:03:52.542 --> 1:03:54.542
- Did you notice I just
called you Theresa?

1:03:54.542 --> 1:03:57.875
That's because I'm adopted
and you're not my real mother.

1:03:57.875 --> 1:03:58.875
Bye bye.

1:03:58.875 --> 1:04:00.167
- Okay, listen, I
understand why you're angry.

1:04:00.167 --> 1:04:01.375
- No, no, I'm not angry.

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:03.292
- Really? 'Cause you
seem a little angry.

1:04:03.292 --> 1:04:05.500
- No. No, this is what
angry sounds like.

1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:07.417
Why didn't you tell me?

1:04:07.417 --> 1:04:10.500
- Because I was afraid, okay?

1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:13.458
I was afraid that if
you knew the truth

1:04:13.458 --> 1:04:16.458
that you would react
like this and run off

1:04:16.458 --> 1:04:18.042
and never talk to me again.

1:04:18.042 --> 1:04:20.000
- Oh, you mean like how
you ran off to Amsterdam?

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:21.333
- That was different.

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:23.208
You went away to college,
you didn't need me.

1:04:23.208 --> 1:04:25.333
- You have no idea what I need.

1:04:25.333 --> 1:04:26.292
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:28.250
I was a flake.

1:04:30.375 --> 1:04:31.958
But we had some
good times, right?

1:04:31.958 --> 1:04:34.083
- Ah, funny, the good times
kinda slipped my mind.

1:04:34.083 --> 1:04:37.042
- Okay, well how 'bout
that time that we cut down

1:04:37.042 --> 1:04:38.542
our own Christmas tree?

1:04:38.542 --> 1:04:40.208
- Ah, that was on
a wildlife preserve

1:04:40.208 --> 1:04:41.458
and we almost got arrested.

1:04:41.458 --> 1:04:42.667
- Okay.

1:04:42.667 --> 1:04:45.500
Well who punched Bobby
Carlisle in the face?

1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:47.083
Remember when he
called you a slut.

1:04:47.083 --> 1:04:49.375
- He was my boyfriend
and I really liked him.

1:04:49.375 --> 1:04:50.917
You ruined that for me.

1:04:52.042 --> 1:04:52.917
- Okay.

1:04:55.375 --> 1:04:56.583
I messed up a few things.

1:04:56.583 --> 1:04:58.375
- Ha, a few.

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:04.417
- Sarah, I tried.

1:05:06.375 --> 1:05:08.167
I did my best.

1:05:13.625 --> 1:05:14.917
- You shoulda told me.

I don't need to think.

I love you, and it

- I think it's locked.

1:09:22.458 --> 1:09:24.625

it's never locked.

- Yes. Something very important.

1:09:37.583 --> 1:09:38.708
But may we come in?

1:09:39.667 --> 1:09:40.542
- Why not.

1:09:46.250 --> 1:09:48.750
(gentle music)

Didn't I tell you

- I owe you all an apology.

1:10:02.792 --> 1:10:03.917
- No you don't.
- Oh, honey.

1:10:03.917 --> 1:10:05.750
- No, yes, I do.

1:10:06.667 --> 1:10:08.667
Look, what I said before

1:10:08.667 --> 1:10:10.708
about you all being
a whacked out family,

1:10:10.708 --> 1:10:12.542
I...I didn't mean it.

1:10:13.792 --> 1:10:15.792
Well, yes, I did.

1:10:15.792 --> 1:10:19.833
But you're my
whacked out family.

1:10:21.833 --> 1:10:25.458
Totie, mom.

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:27.250
Dad.

1:10:28.875 --> 1:10:32.833
Let's face it, you
weren't the ideal parents.

1:10:32.833 --> 1:10:33.708
So what?

1:10:34.708 --> 1:10:36.958
You know, you...you raised me

1:10:36.958 --> 1:10:39.500
and you were always there for me

1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:42.708
and you tried to show
me how to enjoy life.

1:10:43.958 --> 1:10:47.000
And maybe you were
a little reckless.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.417
But maybe I should try and
be a little more like that.

1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:57.667
Anyway, I want you to continue

1:10:57.667 --> 1:11:01.583
to be my crazy,
whacked out mother

1:11:01.583 --> 1:11:06.500
and I want you all to continue
to be my flaky family.

1:11:09.375 --> 1:11:12.875
And James does too,
don't you James?

1:11:17.458 --> 1:11:20.750
- Sarah, that's that nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

1:11:22.042 --> 1:11:22.917
I think.

1:11:32.958 --> 1:11:34.333
- This is great.

1:11:34.333 --> 1:11:35.875
Maybe we should have a
group hug to celebrate.

1:11:35.875 --> 1:11:38.458
- Hey, we don't do that
kinda crap around here.

1:11:38.458 --> 1:11:39.792
- Of course not, why would you.

1:11:39.792 --> 1:11:42.000
How stupid of me,
what was I thinking?

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.042
- Would you like to
shake hands instead?

1:11:44.042 --> 1:11:46.917
Or you could comb Donny's
hair, he seems to like that.

1:11:46.917 --> 1:11:49.583
- James, maybe you're right.

1:11:49.583 --> 1:11:51.375
We are family.
(door creeks)

1:11:51.375 --> 1:11:55.042
We should let
bygones be bygones.

1:11:55.042 --> 1:11:57.500
Let's...let's have a group hug.

1:11:57.500 --> 1:11:59.792
- Dorth, I think we should talk.

1:11:59.792 --> 1:12:01.625
- Aunt Sunny, can't
you take a hint?

1:12:01.625 --> 1:12:02.500
- Where's my bat?

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:04.500
- She has a bat? Of
course she has a bat.

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:05.750
- I told you to stay out.

1:12:05.750 --> 1:12:08.375
- Grandma, what about all that
stuff you said about bygones?

1:12:08.375 --> 1:12:11.917
Bygones are all gone,
now you get out of my way

1:12:11.917 --> 1:12:13.500
unless you want some of this.

1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:14.917
- Dorth, let's try to talk.

1:12:14.917 --> 1:12:16.917
We can try to talk!
- Oh I'm gonna kill you.

1:12:16.917 --> 1:12:18.458
I'm gonna get you this time!

1:12:18.458 --> 1:12:20.417
- No Dorth!
- Get out!

1:12:20.417 --> 1:12:23.667
- You crazy old lady!
(women screaming)

1:12:23.667 --> 1:12:26.500

1:12:33.042 --> 1:12:34.625
- You crazy old lady!

1:12:34.625 --> 1:12:38.875
I have been chased all my
life with that damn bat-

1:12:38.875 --> 1:12:41.167
- I'm gonna hit you over
the head with this bat!

1:12:41.167 --> 1:12:43.958
- If you think you're gonna
catch me, you're not gonna.

1:12:43.958 --> 1:12:47.500
- Oh I'm gonna get you. You're
gonna get your head busted!

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:50.708
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1:12:50.708 --> 1:12:52.875
- Shouldn't we do
something? Call somebody?

1:12:54.708 --> 1:12:56.792
- No, grandma won't catcher her.

1:12:56.792 --> 1:12:57.667
- Oh?

1:12:57.667 --> 1:12:58.708
- She never does.

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:00.417
- This has happened before?

1:13:00.417 --> 1:13:01.708
- Oh, many times.

1:13:01.708 --> 1:13:04.417
(hand slaps)
Welcome to the family, James.

1:13:04.417 --> 1:13:05.625
This is still a celebration.

1:13:05.625 --> 1:13:07.250
It's time for more cake.

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:09.750
- Did you ever get
checked for diabetes?

1:13:09.750 --> 1:13:11.583
- Doctor said-

1:13:11.583 --> 1:13:13.750
- That doctor, No, thanks.

1:13:13.750 --> 1:13:17.042
(jazzy piano music)
(James sighs)

1:13:17.042 --> 1:13:19.583
- Here's the million
dollar question.

1:13:19.583 --> 1:13:20.917
Do you still wanna marry me?

1:13:22.833 --> 1:13:23.792
James?

1:13:23.792 --> 1:13:24.667
- I'm thinking.

1:13:24.667 --> 1:13:25.875
- What?

1:13:25.875 --> 1:13:28.958
- I'm kidding. I told
you, it's you I love.

1:13:28.958 --> 1:13:30.583
They're not so bad.

1:13:30.583 --> 1:13:32.708
However, now that
I've met your family.

1:13:34.458 --> 1:13:36.083
They're right, it
does sound stupid.

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:38.250
I'm gonna stop saying however.

1:13:38.250 --> 1:13:40.000
- (laughs) You could
say nonetheless.

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.125
- Right.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:44.083
- Or notwithstanding,
or howbeit, or-

1:13:45.583 --> 1:13:48.167
(lips smacking)

1:13:48.167 --> 1:13:50.958
- Now that I met your
family you gotta meet mine.

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:52.667
But they're no walk
in the park either.

1:13:52.667 --> 1:13:55.500
- Yeah, well they can't be
as bad as my family, so.

1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:58.000
- That's what you think,
but just you wait.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.792
No, you're right,
it's not even close.

1:13:59.792 --> 1:14:01.792
I've never experienced people
like this before in my life.

1:14:01.792 --> 1:14:04.083
I think I kinda got
along with your uncles.

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:07.958
- You got smashed on homemade
hooch with my uncles.

1:14:07.958 --> 1:14:10.542
- Exactly. What better
way to get along?

1:14:11.625 --> 1:14:12.500
- Let's go.

1:14:14.083 --> 1:14:15.583

those ape boxers?

1:14:15.583 --> 1:14:16.625
- No.

1:14:16.625 --> 1:14:18.625
- You like those, right? I look-

1:14:18.625 --> 1:14:19.500
- No.

1:14:20.667 --> 1:14:23.083
(door creaks)

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.167
- You'll never catch me,

1:14:29.167 --> 1:14:30.833
you've been trying
to do this for years!

1:14:30.833 --> 1:14:31.750
