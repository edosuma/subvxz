Any similarity to any actual incident is purely coincidental.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.400
You guys,

01:11.500 --> 01:14.169
do you know what's inside that
power plant?

01:14.269 --> 01:15.339
What? What?

01:15.439 --> 01:16.809
A robot.

01:16.909 --> 01:18.710
A really big robot.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.410
That's crazy, you idiot.

01:20.510 --> 01:24.249
It's not a robot. It's a rice cooker.

01:24.349 --> 01:25.320
Who said so?

01:25.420 --> 01:27.020
My brother said so.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.259
There's a really big rice cooker.

01:29.359 --> 01:32.159
They use the cooking water to
make electricity.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.830
Hey, why would they have
such a big rice cooker?

01:34.930 --> 01:35.900
Where is it?

01:36.000 --> 01:36.800
That's right!

01:36.900 --> 01:38.330
My brother said,

01:38.430 --> 01:42.029
because of that rice cooker,
we can enjoy life.

01:42.129 --> 01:45.640
Thanks to it, our country will
be rich soon.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.740
It's a wonderful rice cooker.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.870
That's not right.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.779
Our teacher said,

01:52.879 --> 01:54.879
what was it again?

01:54.979 --> 01:57.580
She said it was like a box.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.290
If it were ever opened, evil
would come out.

02:00.390 --> 02:02.660
What evil? There's no way.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.960
It's a good thing.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.049
You'll see.

02:21.770 --> 02:26.780
-=Pandora=-

02:31.479 --> 02:32.689
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

02:32.789 --> 02:33.890
<i>Get up!</i>

02:33.990 --> 02:36.820
Grandma says she'll kill you if
you don't get up quickly.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.089
Let her kill me. Let her kill me.

02:39.189 --> 02:42.189
Grandma, Uncle won't get up!

02:42.289 --> 02:45.629
- Be quiet.
- Let me go!

02:45.729 --> 02:48.400
Get out here before I beat you!

02:48.500 --> 02:49.640
I'm up. I'm up.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.869
If you have eyes, then look!

02:51.969 --> 02:55.039
It's been packed since early
this morning.

02:55.139 --> 02:58.680
Are you an important official,
sleeping until now?

02:58.780 --> 03:01.270
<i>- Some bowls of rice over here!
- Okay.</i>

03:01.509 --> 03:03.450
Be careful or I'll smash it.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.089
Get out here and eat.

03:06.189 --> 03:09.520
<i>You're not a son.
You're an enemy.</i>

03:10.560 --> 03:14.750
<i>Hurry and eat. Eat.</i>

03:16.460 --> 03:17.659
Aren't you off today?

03:17.759 --> 03:18.599
I am off.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.469
But,

03:19.569 --> 03:22.599
seeing me so excited wakes
you up, doesn't it?

03:22.699 --> 03:24.969
Go out and get a job. What
are you doing staying home?

03:25.069 --> 03:26.740
You're all so pitiful.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.640
Just to earn a little money,

03:28.740 --> 03:30.610
your eyes are so red.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.140
Brother-in-law, please eat.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.111
Your stomach will feel better.

03:33.211 --> 03:34.809
Sister-in-law, you're unbelievable.

03:34.909 --> 03:36.520
Why didn't you give us any?

03:36.620 --> 03:37.650
I'm sorry.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.450
There's only enough food to
feed my brother-in-law.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.619
Sister-in-law!

03:40.719 --> 03:41.789
=Moving quickly, =

03:41.889 --> 03:46.260
=his 5-day visit to four Middle
East nations is over. This morning...=.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.390
That man is always traveling.

03:48.490 --> 03:51.099
Isn't it to energize the national
economy?

03:51.199 --> 03:54.219
<i>He's a hard-working young man.</i>

03:55.229 --> 03:56.860
What?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.640
Are you crazy?

04:03.740 --> 04:07.180
Last night you went to a club
to pick up girls, didn't you?

04:07.280 --> 04:11.680
Then you went out drinking at
a street stall.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.190
I just drank a bit.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.089
I went straight home afterward.

04:19.189 --> 04:20.529
It's true!

04:20.629 --> 04:24.189
You are dead today.

04:24.629 --> 04:26.200
Auntie, I'm going.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.229
Why?

04:27.329 --> 04:29.200
I thought you were going to
break his legs.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.669
Wait until after work.

04:31.769 --> 04:34.109
- Eonni, work hard.
- Take care.

04:34.209 --> 04:34.740
Here.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.899
<i>The road ahead is looking
pretty dark.</i>

04:42.819 --> 04:44.179
I'm in a bad mood today.

04:44.279 --> 04:46.589
I'm not feeling great, either.

04:46.689 --> 04:48.740
Can I just take a day off?

04:49.959 --> 04:54.059
Today, should you and I...
have it out?

04:54.159 --> 04:55.729
Should we have it out?
Should we end it?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.200
I understand!

04:57.300 --> 05:00.870
<i>Min Jae, come quickly! Your
uncle's going to hit someone.</i>

05:00.970 --> 05:02.739
Sister-in-law!

05:02.839 --> 05:05.270
<i>We want to live in a world free
of a nuclear threat!</i>

05:05.370 --> 05:07.210
<i>Stop nuclear power plant
operation!</i>

05:07.310 --> 05:15.310
<i>Stop operation! Close the
nuclear power plant!</i>

05:16.180 --> 05:19.419
Oh, these guys! Seriously.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.859
Seriously. This has gone on for
several days.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.620
This really sucks. When can
we get in?

05:25.720 --> 05:29.060
Get out of the way!

05:29.160 --> 05:31.060
Don't tell me none of you
need electricity?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.900
You all live comfortably thanks
to whom? Still you cause trouble.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.429
Hurry and get out of the way!

05:35.529 --> 05:37.469
All of you need to wake up!

05:37.569 --> 05:39.000
Is it okay to earn your money
this way?

05:39.100 --> 05:42.890
If you don't close it very soon,
we're all going to die!

05:42.990 --> 05:45.179
You've been saying that for
years now!

05:45.279 --> 05:48.250
Stop all the nonsense and get
out of the way!

05:48.709 --> 05:49.380
Ajussi!

05:49.480 --> 05:50.419
Just drive through!

05:50.519 --> 05:52.020
What did you say?
You're going in?

05:52.120 --> 05:55.120
You'll have to step on all of us
to go inside!

05:55.220 --> 05:56.719
Everybody, lie down!

05:56.819 --> 05:59.729
Lie down! Lie down!

05:59.829 --> 06:03.019
Why are you all doing this?

06:03.199 --> 06:05.790
<i>The bus is here. The bus is here.</i>

06:09.199 --> 06:10.000
Aigoo, seriously.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.270
What happened this time?

06:11.370 --> 06:14.270
Don't mention it. Those bastards.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.510
Today, they were lying right
on the street in front of us.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.510
We should have squashed them.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.779
They deserve to be flattened.
You've all worked hard.

06:20.879 --> 06:23.419
- Hyeongnim, you can go home.
- Okay, okay.

06:23.519 --> 06:24.919
Hey kid,

06:25.019 --> 06:27.089
you don't even say hello to
your father?

06:27.189 --> 06:27.890
You've worked hard.

06:27.990 --> 06:30.659
See. See. Aigoo.

06:30.759 --> 06:33.960
All of you have been drinking
again.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.260
Just a little.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.200
What do you mean by just
a little?

06:38.300 --> 06:39.529
How can you come to work
like this?

06:39.629 --> 06:41.229
Work, yeah right.

06:41.329 --> 06:42.799
I just do odd jobs.

06:42.899 --> 06:44.669
You brat.

06:44.769 --> 06:46.469
Don't eat well!

06:46.569 --> 06:48.440
After you eat, change your
underwear.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.979
Wash up and take a nap.

06:50.079 --> 06:53.779
Aigoo, why didn't Heaven take
him away,

06:53.879 --> 06:55.349
instead of taking away my wife?

06:55.449 --> 06:58.779
Aigoo, such is my fate.

06:59.350 --> 07:02.989
You might as well hurry and die.
You're always talking like that.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.260
You shouldn't say that.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.729
How can you tell him to die,
you disloyal son.

07:07.829 --> 07:09.700
You must still be drunk.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.029
- How can he go on like this?
- Right.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.529
Atomic power generation

07:15.629 --> 07:19.909
<i>relies on nuclear fission creating
heat, which produces steam.</i>

07:20.009 --> 07:25.010
That steam turns a turbine,
which produces electricity.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.450
To put it simply,

07:26.550 --> 07:28.109
an atom is like firewood
in a stove.

07:28.209 --> 07:30.520
<i>The steam-maker is like the
water in a rice cooker.</i>

07:30.620 --> 07:32.580
<i>This is one way to explain it.</i>

07:32.680 --> 07:33.990
<i>Atomic power generation,</i>

07:34.090 --> 07:37.059
<i>compared to fuels which will be
exhausted in the near future,</i>

07:37.159 --> 07:40.330
<i>such as petroleum, coal, or
other combustible fuel,</i>

07:40.430 --> 07:41.990
<i>the only alternative energy.</i>

07:42.090 --> 07:44.659
<i>Moreover, it can prevent the
use of flammable fuel,</i>

07:44.759 --> 07:48.669
<i>global warming, acid rain, and
other environmental damage.</i>

07:48.769 --> 07:50.839
<i>It's an environmentally friendly
power source.</i>

07:50.939 --> 07:56.510
<i>Also, it is a highly efficient energy industry
that uses only a small amount of raw materials.</i>

07:56.610 --> 07:57.440
<i>In addition,</i>

07:57.540 --> 07:59.109
<i>with a seismic resistance
rating of level 7,</i>

07:59.209 --> 08:01.880
<i>sturdy, earthquake-resistant
equipment,</i>

08:01.980 --> 08:06.549
<i>layers of security measures to
prevent accidents,</i>

08:06.649 --> 08:09.489
<i>coupled with a thorough
security and monitoring system,</i>

08:09.589 --> 08:12.760
<i>the risk of accidents is zero.</i>

08:12.860 --> 08:15.960
<i>Everyone's daily life is very
convenient.</i>

08:16.060 --> 08:17.830
<i>Behind this comfortable life,</i>

08:17.930 --> 08:22.169
<i>is a nuclear power station where
the lights will never go out.</i>

08:22.269 --> 08:24.199
<i>Please remember this.</i>

08:24.870 --> 08:26.839
<i>It's funny, isn't it?</i>

08:26.939 --> 08:28.440
<i>A sign of the apocalypse.</i>

08:28.540 --> 08:29.580
<i>Just look.</i>

08:29.680 --> 08:31.779
<i>Is this a place where people
should live?</i>

08:31.879 --> 08:34.409
This place, before that thing came,

08:34.509 --> 08:38.020
was poor, but still a decent
place to live.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.020
But look at it now.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.090
There's no fishing. You can't fish.

08:42.190 --> 08:45.260
Tourists have also disappeared
and there is no development.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.059
The village people are divided
and argue every day.

08:49.159 --> 08:51.100
All because of that thing!

08:51.200 --> 08:54.130
But still, thanks to it, we have
a life now.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.000
My mom is also grateful to
that thing.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.470
Without it,

08:57.570 --> 08:58.669
would we die of hunger?

08:58.769 --> 09:00.439
Not really, but still...

09:00.539 --> 09:03.480
This is the problem. This.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.539
Are you all happy living like this?

09:05.639 --> 09:07.010
Who has to be happy?

09:07.110 --> 09:10.679
You only need to live, right?

09:10.779 --> 09:13.620
Foolish bastards.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.319
That's why we have no future!

09:17.419 --> 09:19.189
All of you should just live like this.

09:19.289 --> 09:22.159
As for me, I can't do that.

09:22.259 --> 09:27.490
I don't think now is the time to
worry about your future.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.970
Just say you haven't seen me.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.480
Yeon Ju! Yeon Ju!

09:36.580 --> 09:38.600
Yeon Ju!

09:42.279 --> 09:44.940
Geez, that girl.

09:49.019 --> 09:49.959
Damn it.

09:50.059 --> 09:52.319
I've told you so many times to
buy a new one.

09:52.419 --> 09:55.329
With what money? I don't even
have stockings to wear.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.759
Why throw it out if it's
perfectly good?

09:58.629 --> 10:01.429
What's perfectly good?

10:02.000 --> 10:06.669
Just like people, machines also
have a life span.

10:06.769 --> 10:08.309
If you're not careful, you might
have to walk.

10:08.409 --> 10:09.640
Be quiet.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.880
I'll just drive slowly.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.380
Are you afraid people won't
know you work at the power plant?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.520
That's how you act.

10:16.620 --> 10:19.279
How many times do you have
to fall before you wake up?

10:19.379 --> 10:20.850
Does your mouth fix things?

10:20.950 --> 10:24.950
You really don't have many
skills to brag about.

10:28.490 --> 10:29.730
Come over here and look.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.360
See if you can fix it.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.069
Why should I?

10:33.169 --> 10:34.400
You should learn how!

10:34.500 --> 10:36.399
How long should I fix things
for you?

10:37.100 --> 10:39.970
Now you even get tired
making repairs?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.470
It's not that I'm tired.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.409
I'm afraid that if I'm not around...

10:43.509 --> 10:45.840
Oppa, why wouldn't you be
around?

10:47.279 --> 10:48.750
What's the matter?

10:48.850 --> 10:52.940
You're planning something
again, aren't you? Aren't you?

10:59.289 --> 11:00.260
Move out of the way.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.990
What are you doing?

11:04.460 --> 11:05.860
I am going away for 2 years.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.500
I am going away for 2 years.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.159
Where are you going?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.569
For 6 months to South America
to fish for octopus.

11:15.669 --> 11:19.279
The other 6 months to Alaska
to fish for saury.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.949
Two cycles like that.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.750
I can earn at least $200,000.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.419
I have skills. If I get into the
engine room, I can even earn more.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.450
Jerk!

11:29.919 --> 11:31.390
Damn it!

11:31.490 --> 11:32.919
Oppa, are you even human?

11:33.019 --> 11:34.360
What does that mean?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.159
Do I have parents?

11:36.259 --> 11:38.059
Brothers? Sisters? Relatives?

11:38.159 --> 11:39.559
You know I don't have any
family.

11:39.659 --> 11:42.929
Don't you know whom I've
relied on all this time?

11:43.029 --> 11:44.799
I know. I know.

11:44.899 --> 11:47.010
But I'm doing this to make you
happy.

11:47.110 --> 11:48.409
Please understand my feelings.

11:48.509 --> 11:49.740
Forget it.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.579
I won't be deceived anymore.

11:51.679 --> 11:54.769
If you want to go, then our
relationship is over.

11:55.879 --> 11:57.820
Yeon Ju!

11:58.379 --> 12:00.720
That damn girl.

12:01.090 --> 12:01.950
This is for you.

12:02.090 --> 12:03.490
What is this?

12:03.659 --> 12:05.620
It's from Secretary Kim.

12:05.789 --> 12:08.279
He said to be sure you read it.

12:08.460 --> 12:12.230
What report would the
Secretary's Office send to you?

12:12.529 --> 12:16.870
He said according to normal procedures,
he couldn't send it directly to you.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.299
So he sent it directly to me.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.929
Is there a problem lately?

12:22.070 --> 12:24.009
What do you mean?

12:24.679 --> 12:25.769
Take a look.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.470
I think it's important.

12:35.024 --> 12:37.020
- =Practical Status of the
Hanbyul Unit ♪1=-

12:37.120 --> 12:40.149
I told you not to worry.

12:40.330 --> 12:41.990
This nuclear reactor thing,

12:42.159 --> 12:43.929
as long as you keep pouring
cool water on it,

12:44.029 --> 12:46.399
it can keep running 365 days
a year.

12:46.529 --> 12:47.120
No.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.529
For 10 years, 20 years,

12:48.700 --> 12:52.639
it can keep turning without any
problems.

12:52.799 --> 12:55.269
Isn't that why atomic energy is
so great?

12:55.440 --> 12:58.309
It's the fire that never burns out.

12:58.440 --> 13:02.070
It is science's greatest gift to
mankind.

13:02.279 --> 13:04.509
The greatest gift?

13:04.649 --> 13:07.549
Managed well and used
properly, it can be great.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.379
But if it's like this,

13:09.549 --> 13:12.320
it's not a gift, but a cause for
headaches.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.220
What the heck are you talking
about?

13:14.360 --> 13:17.590
A guy who doesn't know the ABC's of
atomic energy is running that department.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.559
<i>Okay, thank you!</i>

13:18.730 --> 13:21.889
Nuclear reactors that aren't
fully prepared are being started.

13:22.070 --> 13:27.600
Worst of all, a special law with
many problems was passed.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.330
At such a time,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.769
where is that bastard going
to stop?

13:31.940 --> 13:33.470
No matter what,

13:33.649 --> 13:36.669
they must keep turning properly.

13:36.820 --> 13:40.250
Only by doing that will we all
survive.

13:40.419 --> 13:44.649
Well... nothing is going to
happen.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.750
<i>Our employee...</i>

13:46.929 --> 13:50.730
<i>is a specialist who has worked in a
nuclear power plant for over 20 years.</i>

13:52.659 --> 13:54.699
<i>Don't worry. Let's not go
looking for trouble, okay?</i>

13:54.799 --> 13:57.669
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

13:58.970 --> 14:02.669
Don't get angry and just
listen to me.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.769
Just going for 2 years, I can
make up all the money I lost!

14:05.940 --> 14:08.639
Enough! Don't mention
it again!

14:12.019 --> 14:15.679
That's right, Brother-in-law.
Don't go.

14:17.720 --> 14:18.720
Sister-in-law.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.100
Do you want to live here
forever?

14:20.259 --> 14:21.490
What about Min Jae?

14:21.659 --> 14:24.419
Are you going to insist he
work at the power plant?

14:24.559 --> 14:25.500
No.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.549
Then move to Seoul.
Let him study.

14:27.730 --> 14:28.870
Send him to a good university.

14:28.970 --> 14:30.429
That's what you should do!

14:30.600 --> 14:33.799
Should Min Jae have to waste
his life in a place like this?

14:33.940 --> 14:37.269
Before my brother passed away,
he entrusted Min Jae to me.

14:37.409 --> 14:39.970
For the sake of Min Jae's future...

14:41.649 --> 14:43.049
Who are you trying to fool?

14:43.210 --> 14:44.409
Why use Min Jae as an excuse?

14:44.580 --> 14:45.779
I'm not trying to fool anyone!

14:45.879 --> 14:47.549
He's my one and only nephew.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.149
Mom, you should also think
about your only grandson's future.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.450
Let go!

14:51.620 --> 14:53.610
Don't expect to go anywhere.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.590
Don't even think about going
one step from my sight!

14:57.960 --> 15:01.389
I want to go. I have to go.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.690
That rotten jerk.

15:02.870 --> 15:06.700
You refuse to get married and
just want to run away.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.029
<i>Don't you feel sorry for Yeon Ju?</i>

15:11.110 --> 15:12.399
Min Jae.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.100
You hate it here too, right?

15:14.279 --> 15:15.580
I really like it.

15:15.710 --> 15:16.710
Why are you lying on your
stomach in here?

15:16.850 --> 15:18.210
Go see your mother.

15:18.379 --> 15:20.580
This room is crowded.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.980
I like sleeping with you, Uncle.

15:23.149 --> 15:24.549
Get off me, you brat.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.120
Uncle, you can't go anywhere.

15:27.330 --> 15:30.950
I don't want you to go away.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.000
I'm surrounded by shackles!
Shackles!

15:34.169 --> 15:35.720
Turn off the light.

16:00.289 --> 16:01.459
=Emergency condition.=

16:01.559 --> 16:03.250
=All Wolchon residents.=.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.190
Mother-in-law.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.590
What?

16:07.730 --> 16:13.299
If brother-in-law wants to go,
shouldn't you let him go?

16:13.470 --> 16:15.440
Why?

16:15.610 --> 16:17.629
Were you touched by what
he said?

16:17.809 --> 16:20.779
No. It's not like that.

16:21.450 --> 16:24.779
He really hates working at the
power plant.

16:24.950 --> 16:28.279
I don't feel it's right to force
him to work there.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.350
That place...

16:30.889 --> 16:34.720
took away my husband and my son.

16:34.889 --> 16:38.690
I didn't want my remaining
son to work there, either.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.289
I didn't want that for him.

16:42.470 --> 16:44.129
<i>So when he took his father's
compensation</i>

16:44.299 --> 16:46.200
<i>and opened a business in the
city,</i>

16:46.370 --> 16:48.740
<i>I never said a word against it.</i>

16:48.940 --> 16:50.909
<i>I was praying in my heart</i>

16:51.080 --> 16:53.539
<i>that his business went well and
he would never come back here.</i>

16:53.710 --> 16:55.679
Stop goofing off and get back
to work!

16:55.850 --> 16:57.039
<i>But look at him.</i>

16:57.220 --> 17:00.080
He went bankrupt and came
back penniless.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.819
That pathetic jerk,

17:01.919 --> 17:05.009
if he had to work in hell instead of the
power plant, he shouldn't complain.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.959
That's because the government granted
supply contracts to entrepreneurs.

17:08.059 --> 17:09.789
What are you talking about?

17:09.930 --> 17:13.960
It was his own fault! Why make
excuses for him?

17:14.670 --> 17:16.789
Oh right. We're out of soy sauce.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.630
Mother-in-law, I'll go and buy
some soy sauce.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.240
<i>What about money?</i>

17:24.940 --> 17:28.670
<i>That money was for his father's
life! His father's life!</i>

17:32.619 --> 17:33.590
Welcome.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.779
How do you do things here?

17:35.950 --> 17:37.720
I was told to be here early
this morning.

17:37.859 --> 17:39.250
I'm sorry.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.819
Didn't I tell you to get rid of
that report quickly?

17:41.990 --> 17:43.490
Why is it still causing problems?

17:43.660 --> 17:45.220
We have sent people to find
the person who wrote it.

17:45.359 --> 17:47.600
Appropriate action has been
taken with relevant personnel.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.220
Take action faster.

17:55.910 --> 17:57.640
Are you looking for me?

17:58.039 --> 18:00.980
Have you seen this report?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.509
I'm not sure.

18:04.650 --> 18:05.240
After I read this, it occurred to me, Prime
Minister, that a few days ago in parliament,

18:05.420 --> 18:09.250
After I read this, it occurred to me, Prime
Minister, that a few days ago in parliament,

18:09.390 --> 18:14.450
you were pushing a special law
for power generating facilities.

18:14.630 --> 18:17.460
Construction of power plants is
not an unusual thing.

18:17.599 --> 18:21.859
Mr. President, I heard you had
already seen and approved it.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.490
I've never done anything like
that.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.100
I'm sorry, but the bill has already
been passed by parliament.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.430
If there is a problem after
the audit,

18:27.609 --> 18:29.539
then the right of refusal must
be corrected.

18:29.710 --> 18:32.569
Isn't this what the
Administration and I should do?

18:32.740 --> 18:35.539
What the Blue House should do,

18:35.680 --> 18:37.880
is not waste energy on small
matters like this,

18:38.049 --> 18:43.039
but focus their efforts to
invigorate the economy.

18:43.819 --> 18:45.450
Talent Development Institute?

18:46.220 --> 18:46.880
Yes.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.650
Headquarters contacted me
about this transfer.

18:49.789 --> 18:53.130
You have to go to headquarters
and see.

18:53.259 --> 18:54.390
What is the reason?

18:54.599 --> 18:57.160
You've been working on the
front line here for a long time.

18:57.339 --> 18:58.859
It's time to take a step back.

18:59.039 --> 19:00.769
Isn't working to cultivate talent

19:00.940 --> 19:02.099
also another way of caring?

19:02.240 --> 19:05.470
So it is. So it is. Caring.

19:05.640 --> 19:10.410
<i>Thanks to you, several secretaries
also lost their jobs.</i>

19:11.750 --> 19:15.240
Why would you give up a good
job to go sit in a boat?

19:15.390 --> 19:16.789
Plus, you're wasting 2 years.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.079
Should I...

19:18.259 --> 19:19.719
for the sake of this damn power
plant,

19:19.819 --> 19:22.549
devote all of my abilities?

19:22.690 --> 19:23.749
I was dragged here by force,
you know.

19:23.849 --> 19:24.960
I was dragged here by force,
you know.

19:25.130 --> 19:29.599
You're like this because of what
happened to your father and brother.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.529
- If you just...
- That's enough.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.099
Okay. I'll shut up.

19:33.269 --> 19:34.029
But what are you going to do?

19:34.170 --> 19:36.539
We don't want you to go!

19:36.740 --> 19:39.230
Are you going to run away in
the middle of the night?

19:39.410 --> 19:40.410
Someday,

19:40.579 --> 19:41.550
everyone will understand.

19:41.650 --> 19:42.700
You're nuts!

19:42.880 --> 19:44.140
What are you going to do?

19:44.279 --> 19:45.620
A man who wants to do great
things,

19:45.720 --> 19:48.410
must go through some wind
and rain.

19:48.589 --> 19:50.990
That's why you've been so
quiet lately, right?

19:51.160 --> 19:55.289
A storm is coming.
The storm will hit...

19:58.660 --> 20:01.059
It's an earthquake!

20:05.440 --> 20:06.200
Run outside!

20:06.369 --> 20:06.890
Mom!

20:07.069 --> 20:10.769
Min Jae!

20:43.410 --> 20:45.140
<i>Don't panic!</i>

20:51.079 --> 20:53.519
Why doesn't she answer?

20:59.660 --> 21:00.490
=lt's me.=.

21:00.630 --> 21:01.959
Hurry and check out the
restaurant.

21:02.059 --> 21:04.030
My mom and sister-in-law
aren't answering the phone.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.930
=I'm on my way over there.=.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.329
Good, go take a look.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.429
Call me immediately.

21:08.529 --> 21:09.089
=Okay.=

21:09.269 --> 21:11.200
=Just wait a bit.=.

21:11.369 --> 21:12.799
Mother-in-law!

21:14.809 --> 21:15.500
Is our house okay?

21:15.670 --> 21:17.170
Mother-in-law!

21:17.339 --> 21:21.299
Min Jae! Min Jae!

21:22.950 --> 21:24.640
Mother-in-law!

21:24.819 --> 21:26.720
Omo, Min Jae! Min Jae!

21:28.250 --> 21:29.410
Mom!

21:29.589 --> 21:30.210
I'm fine.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.390
What happened?

21:31.490 --> 21:34.390
The ceiling suddenly collapsed.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.319
It fell down on top of us.

21:36.490 --> 21:37.150
It's all right.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.019
It's okay. It's okay.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.269
Mother-in-law, are you okay?

21:40.369 --> 21:44.029
I'm okay. I'm fine.

21:46.599 --> 21:48.799
An earthquake has occurred in
the southeastern region.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.099
It was a 6.1.

21:51.279 --> 21:52.540
If it's the southeastern region,

21:52.640 --> 21:54.839
then it's Ulsan, where the
Munsan Industrial Park is.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.039
Yes, that's right.

21:56.210 --> 21:58.650
Should we tell the president?

21:58.849 --> 22:02.509
It's not the right time now.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.420
Please reconsider.

22:05.589 --> 22:11.190
If the Blue House and the administration
oppose each other, no one benefits.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.890
Is there any problem with the
way I run the country?

22:14.069 --> 22:17.130
Mr. President, when you were in
parliament, there were many minds.

22:17.299 --> 22:19.359
Therefore, every decision took
a long time.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.700
This is not a suitable operation
of national politics.

22:21.839 --> 22:23.200
Especially,

22:23.339 --> 22:26.500
at a time when the national
economy is in near paralysis.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.940
At such a time, rather than
the courage of youth,

22:29.079 --> 22:33.349
age and experience play a
greater role.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.779
Quickly confirm it.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.619
Confirm the amount of radiation.

22:40.759 --> 22:41.759
What's going on?

22:41.859 --> 22:43.490
The earthquake caused the
cooling system

22:43.660 --> 22:45.690
of reactor ♪1 at valve 57
to develop a crack.

22:45.859 --> 22:47.019
Have you started the
emergency contingency plan?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.319
We have already mobilized the
emergency plan.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.559
We used the joystick to
stabilize the reactor.

22:50.740 --> 22:52.930
How serious is it?

22:53.099 --> 22:54.940
No problem if we can find the
crack and replace the part.

22:55.109 --> 22:55.940
We will soon be able to recover.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.509
Look, is this a small accident
in your eyes?

22:58.680 --> 23:00.740
It's not the first time, so you
should relax.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.680
We've done the proper protocols.
Why are you so worried?

23:03.849 --> 23:06.279
Reactor No. 1 is 40 years old.

23:06.450 --> 23:09.650
Water pipes in a house that are 40
years old will corrode and crack.

23:09.750 --> 23:10.750
Water pipes in a house that are 40
years old will corrode and crack.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.259
Haven't you replaced any parts
up until now?

23:14.390 --> 23:16.589
We've spent billions and
replaced parts countless times.

23:16.789 --> 23:19.089
But this huge equipment has
30,000 valves.

23:19.259 --> 23:20.819
The pipeline is 170 km long.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.230
We have 1700 km of cable.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.160
In which corner is the crack,

23:25.339 --> 23:26.740
and where is the defective part?

23:26.900 --> 23:29.529
Doing a detailed inspection will
take several years.

23:29.710 --> 23:33.200
But we're given 2 months to complete the
work and then start the machine again?

23:33.380 --> 23:36.539
It's simply impossible to do
a detailed inspection!

23:36.710 --> 23:38.609
Then what should we do now?

23:38.779 --> 23:40.049
Issue a white alert.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.579
Notify the nearby residents.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.119
Superintendent, please don't
interfere!

23:44.289 --> 23:46.920
You're not qualified to
give orders here!

23:47.089 --> 23:48.920
Everyone should calm down.

23:49.059 --> 23:52.390
Just do your usual work,
your usual work.

23:53.730 --> 23:56.789
First report to headquarters.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.529
I was just recently promoted.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.069
The Hanbyul nuclear power plant?

24:01.240 --> 24:01.900
Yes.

24:02.069 --> 24:04.200
The cooling water leaked a
little bit.

24:04.380 --> 24:06.640
A white alert should be issued.

24:06.809 --> 24:07.809
What should we do?

24:07.980 --> 24:11.400
If there's no problem with the
power supply, why make one?

24:11.579 --> 24:14.519
Don't you know we can't afford any incidents
when there are problems with that bill?

24:14.690 --> 24:16.049
That may be the case,

24:16.220 --> 24:18.119
but we've had big problems
before.

24:18.289 --> 24:19.809
Because it wasn't handled properly!

24:19.990 --> 24:22.480
I will handle it quietly.

24:26.099 --> 24:28.900
Why at this time?

24:29.099 --> 24:33.559
I guess this person and Min Jae's
father were watching over us.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.829
We were lucky in a bad
situation.

24:36.009 --> 24:38.309
That's for sure.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.409
Yeah, it's me.

24:39.509 --> 24:40.839
=How is it?=.

24:41.009 --> 24:42.009
Not too bad.

24:42.109 --> 24:44.980
Your mom, sister-in-law, and
Min Jae are fine.

24:45.119 --> 24:46.140
Should I put your mom on?

24:46.319 --> 24:47.919
=lt's not necessary if there's
no problem.=

24:48.019 --> 24:51.390
=Also, tell them to answer
the phone.=

24:52.289 --> 24:54.690
I guess Oppa is worried about
all of you.

24:54.859 --> 24:55.690
That brat.

24:55.859 --> 24:58.690
He should worry about himself.

24:59.029 --> 25:00.329
I need to leave now.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.660
My office is also in chaos.

25:01.799 --> 25:03.759
Okay.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.559
Is the power plant okay?

25:05.740 --> 25:06.669
What do you mean?

25:06.769 --> 25:09.000
There was an earthquake.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.470
What are you talking about?

25:11.640 --> 25:13.410
No matter if it's an earthquake,

25:13.579 --> 25:15.599
nothing will happen to that
power plant.

25:15.750 --> 25:16.679
Isn't that right?

25:16.779 --> 25:17.609
That's right.

25:17.779 --> 25:19.769
It would be dangerous in
earthquakes, otherwise.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.609
Besides, if there was a problem,

25:21.750 --> 25:23.690
everyone would get a text
alert immediately.

25:23.819 --> 25:26.480
Nobody would die like last time.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.279
Did you hear that?

25:28.460 --> 25:29.650
Then, that's a relief.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.660
I was a bit worried.

25:33.430 --> 25:35.559
<i>If you're so worried, then go in
yourself.</i>

25:35.700 --> 25:37.460
You're all the technical staff!

25:37.640 --> 25:39.660
What is going on here?

25:39.799 --> 25:40.769
Sorry.

25:40.869 --> 25:42.839
Come over here.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.410
What happened?

25:45.579 --> 25:47.479
There's a crack in the cooling
water supply valve,

25:47.579 --> 25:49.099
and the cooling water is leaking.

25:49.279 --> 25:50.410
Then, why haven't you taken
any action?

25:50.579 --> 25:51.980
Go inside and fix it quickly.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.170
That's not the issue.

25:53.349 --> 25:55.190
It's too dangerous. Nobody is
willing to go in.

25:55.819 --> 25:58.759
Just give them protective
clothing and proper equipment!

25:58.920 --> 25:59.950
Equipment is to be used.

26:00.119 --> 26:02.459
The level of coolant in the
reactor has dropped dramatically!

26:02.559 --> 26:04.900
If the temperature rises rapidly,

26:05.000 --> 26:05.850
we will have LOCA!

26:05.950 --> 26:06.460
[loss-of-coolant accident.]

26:06.560 --> 26:07.589
What should we do?

26:07.730 --> 26:08.650
Should we continue to delay?

26:08.750 --> 26:08.859
Should we continue to delay?

26:09.029 --> 26:11.190
Go inside immediately!

26:16.140 --> 26:17.609
Radiation levels are too high.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.769
Quiet!

26:19.910 --> 26:21.170
How high is the level?

26:21.309 --> 26:24.299
Stop being nosy and just do
your work!

26:25.250 --> 26:26.609
Ajussi!

26:26.750 --> 26:28.779
If you block it there first,

26:28.920 --> 26:31.150
the pipeline stress will increase
and it will be very dangerous!

26:31.319 --> 26:33.920
Doing this will let us finish
quickly!

26:34.089 --> 26:37.549
Do you think I want to be
down here?

26:37.700 --> 26:41.720
If you're not satisfied, then
you should do it yourself!

26:41.900 --> 26:43.400
You're so annoying!

26:43.529 --> 26:43.990
Hurry! Let's just hurry and finish!

26:44.090 --> 26:45.700
Hurry! Let's just hurry and finish!

26:45.869 --> 26:47.460
<i>This is such a headache.</i>

26:51.480 --> 26:53.470
What's going on here?

26:53.609 --> 26:56.769
What did they weld?
Where was it?

26:58.450 --> 27:01.420
Yes, please speak.

27:01.589 --> 27:02.980
What?

27:03.150 --> 27:09.079
That was because the staff
member said it would save time.

27:09.329 --> 27:11.950
Just a moment.

27:33.519 --> 27:34.980
What's happening?

27:35.119 --> 27:37.019
<i>There must have been an
accident!</i>

27:38.119 --> 27:40.490
Move! Move!

27:41.089 --> 27:44.319
Move!

27:46.329 --> 27:48.130
Wasn't that the team leader?
Team leader.

27:48.299 --> 27:50.059
What's going on?

27:50.500 --> 27:51.259
<i>Father!</i>

27:51.440 --> 27:55.769
<i>Father!</i>

27:56.039 --> 27:56.599
<i>Vital signs are dropping!</i>

27:56.769 --> 27:57.569
<i>We need more medicine!</i>

27:57.740 --> 27:59.940
<i>Nobody move!</i>

28:00.109 --> 28:01.740
<i>This patient is vomiting blood.</i>

28:01.880 --> 28:03.970
<i>He's been exposed to radiation.</i>

28:04.119 --> 28:06.480
<i>Hurry, stop the bleeding.</i>

28:06.619 --> 28:07.140
<i>Father!</i>

28:07.279 --> 28:08.410
<i>No. Don't come in.</i>

28:08.589 --> 28:09.550
<i>Get out of here quickly!</i>

28:09.650 --> 28:10.450
<i>Husband!</i>

28:10.589 --> 28:13.490
<i>Get out quickly!</i>

28:18.660 --> 28:19.920
Jae Hyeok.

28:20.059 --> 28:21.089
What are you doing?

28:21.230 --> 28:22.759
Can't you tell? I'm leaving.

28:22.930 --> 28:25.369
Otherwise, we're all going to die.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.269
Then what should I do?

28:26.440 --> 28:27.769
How should I know?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.209
I don't know what the
problem is.

28:29.309 --> 28:31.500
If they can't fix it quickly,
people will die.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.740
You just can't leave like this.

28:35.509 --> 28:37.109
What do you mean?

28:37.279 --> 28:38.369
Go back inside and help.

28:38.549 --> 28:39.569
Hurry and fix it!

28:39.750 --> 28:41.309
All of those men are inside.

28:41.490 --> 28:43.579
You madman. You must have
a death wish, huh?

28:43.720 --> 28:46.380
Stop talking nonsense and
change your clothes.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.960
You go ahead.

28:48.130 --> 28:48.920
I have to go back.

28:49.089 --> 28:50.089
I'm going back too.

28:50.230 --> 28:51.559
Come on.

28:51.700 --> 28:52.490
Then, I'm going too.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.029
Hey. Hey!

28:55.200 --> 28:58.170
That bunch of idiots.
They must be crazy.

28:58.299 --> 29:01.099
What's wrong with all of you?
How could you hide this news?

29:01.269 --> 29:03.640
Does that make any sense?

29:03.809 --> 29:07.640
We didn't want to make
you worry.

29:07.849 --> 29:08.849
I'm sorry.

29:08.950 --> 29:10.410
Does an apology solve this
problem?

29:10.579 --> 29:12.619
This is a nuclear power plant
accident! An accident!

29:12.950 --> 29:15.480
Please calm down and let's
discuss countermeasures.

29:15.650 --> 29:18.710
If cooling water is leaking, then
radiation is also leaking.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.119
That's correct.

29:20.289 --> 29:22.759
But it is currently limited to the
power plant itself.

29:22.930 --> 29:26.619
We will first issue a blue alert
and evacuate the residents.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.299
Then handle that quickly.

29:28.470 --> 29:29.490
<i>Just a moment.</i>

29:29.670 --> 29:32.529
You should reconsider
evacuating the residents.

29:32.700 --> 29:33.470
Why?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.940
The citizens are concerned
about radiation.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.900
They already know too well

29:38.079 --> 29:39.769
about nuclear power plant
accidents.

29:39.980 --> 29:43.569
In this case, if we broadcast
news of an accident,

29:43.710 --> 29:45.109
and an emergency evacuation
of residents,

29:45.279 --> 29:47.009
regardless of the size of the
accident and evacuation,

29:47.150 --> 29:48.849
there will be a national panic.

29:49.019 --> 29:51.039
So you want to conceal those
facts, also?

29:51.190 --> 29:53.319
After the event, it may be
condemned.

29:53.490 --> 29:58.190
But it is better than a hasty
decision that creates confusion.

29:58.329 --> 30:02.370
The company's safety team will soon
be on site to handle the situation.

30:02.470 --> 30:03.750
Furthermore, our power station's

30:03.869 --> 30:07.430
security control system was
constructed in stages.

30:08.269 --> 30:12.299
The situation is not as serious
as you believe.

30:12.910 --> 30:13.909
Manager!

30:14.009 --> 30:15.809
The water pressure is too high!

30:15.950 --> 30:17.470
Right now it's at 350 kPa!

30:17.650 --> 30:19.009
Why is the hydrogen furnace
not working?

30:19.180 --> 30:22.450
It's working, but is useless with
the pressure rising so fast.

30:22.619 --> 30:24.219
When can the reserve pipeline
be connected?

30:24.319 --> 30:25.989
We need to quickly transport
cooling water!

30:26.089 --> 30:28.289
It's not as easy as it sounds!

30:28.460 --> 30:31.019
The pressure is already at 420.
If it continues, it will explode!

30:31.160 --> 30:33.059
Get here immediately, damn it!

30:33.230 --> 30:34.819
We're the safety team from
headquarters.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.759
You got here quickly.

30:35.930 --> 30:38.130
Who is the person in charge here?

30:38.269 --> 30:39.239
I'm the one in charge.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.059
What is the present situation?

30:40.240 --> 30:43.000
Cooling water leak and nuclear
reactor pressure is rising,

30:43.170 --> 30:44.340
and there is no way to stop it.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.470
How high is the pressure?

30:45.640 --> 30:47.079
It is currently at 350 kPa.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.140
It's too high. We must vent
it quickly!

30:49.309 --> 30:50.309
That's true, but...

30:50.450 --> 30:52.880
Venting is not something we
can decide.

30:53.049 --> 30:54.140
Please wait.

30:54.289 --> 30:55.839
Hey.. What does vent mean?

30:56.019 --> 30:58.650
It means reactor gas emission
to the outside.

30:58.789 --> 30:59.809
Emission?

30:59.990 --> 31:01.860
You said we only needed to
replace the pipeline.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.019
Didn't you say it could be
repaired?

31:04.190 --> 31:07.460
It appears the situation is
more serious than I was told.

31:07.630 --> 31:11.930
I estimate it has reached a
core meltdown.

31:12.069 --> 31:13.259
A meltdown?

31:13.440 --> 31:15.000
If the fuel rod is exposed to air,

31:15.170 --> 31:17.660
the fuel rod temperature will
rise and the fuel will melt.

31:17.839 --> 31:19.400
That is a reactor core meltdown.

31:19.539 --> 31:21.069
<i>This will produce hydrogen.</i>

31:21.250 --> 31:24.839
<i>The hydrogen gas increases
pressure inside the furnace.</i>

31:25.019 --> 31:27.109
<i>The pressure that can be
contained by the reactor is limited.</i>

31:27.250 --> 31:28.509
<i>It has now exceeded that limit.</i>

31:28.690 --> 31:29.620
<i>If it continues,</i>

31:29.720 --> 31:31.619
<i>it will certainly explode.</i>

31:31.789 --> 31:34.349
Then radiation will be emitted
into the air?

31:34.529 --> 31:35.650
Yes, that's correct.

31:36.759 --> 31:39.019
Then we must quickly evacuate
the residents.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.460
Issue an evacuation order
immediately.

31:41.630 --> 31:42.890
Mr. President,

31:43.069 --> 31:45.030
There are 946,000 residents within
20 km from the power station.

31:45.130 --> 31:46.400
There are 946,000 residents within
20 km from the power station.

31:46.569 --> 31:47.560
Within 30 km are Busan, Ulsan,
and Yangsan.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.359
Within 30 km are Busan, Ulsan,
and Yangsan.

31:49.539 --> 31:51.500
Altogether, there are about
3.4 million residents.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.910
Evacuation is impossible.

31:55.079 --> 31:58.539
Isn't there an evacuation plan
to deal with this situation?

31:58.720 --> 31:59.640
There is... no plan like that.

31:59.740 --> 32:01.869
There is... no plan like that.

32:02.019 --> 32:06.579
That's because there was no
practical way to carry it out.

32:06.819 --> 32:08.220
But...

32:08.390 --> 32:12.390
we should at least evacuate
residents near the power station.

32:12.529 --> 32:15.690
During ventilation, they would
be the first to suffer fatal injuries.

32:15.869 --> 32:18.460
There are 17,000 people in the
villages within 5 km.

32:18.640 --> 32:22.230
To evacuate so many people
will take at least 3 hours.

32:22.410 --> 32:24.709
If the reactor exploded in the
middle of that process,

32:24.809 --> 32:26.240
the situation will worsen.

32:26.410 --> 32:30.809
Worst case scenario, 50 million
people will be in danger.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.470
It must be vented immediately.

32:36.950 --> 32:40.910
<i>Mr. President.</i>

32:41.190 --> 32:43.789
Mr. President.

32:45.500 --> 32:46.021
Yes. I understand.

32:46.121 --> 32:48.730
Yes. I understand.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.200
Prepare to vent.

32:52.369 --> 32:53.630
Emergency evacuation of
nearby residents.

32:53.769 --> 32:55.859
What are you saying?

32:56.640 --> 32:57.900
Hurry!

32:58.109 --> 32:59.109
Hurry!

32:59.210 --> 33:01.640
Get on the bus according to
your village.

33:01.809 --> 33:03.539
I understand.

33:03.779 --> 33:07.410
That. That is the bus we take.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.420
Aigoo. Isn't that Yeon Ju?

33:09.549 --> 33:10.019
<i>Yeon Ju!</i>

33:10.190 --> 33:11.190
Auntie!

33:13.019 --> 33:14.460
What is this all about?

33:14.630 --> 33:15.990
I don't know exactly, either.

33:16.160 --> 33:16.920
Hurry and get on the bus.

33:17.089 --> 33:18.089
It's probably nothing.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.229
Right?

33:19.329 --> 33:20.769
It's probably nothing serious,
right?

33:20.900 --> 33:21.630
That's right, Auntie.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.230
Get on the bus.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.769
Let's go.

33:24.940 --> 33:26.230
Have you talked to brother-in-
law on the phone?

33:26.400 --> 33:27.370
He's not answering.

33:27.470 --> 33:28.599
I'll try calling him again.

33:28.769 --> 33:30.900
Hurry, get Min Jae on the bus.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.619
Stop working!

33:42.819 --> 33:46.190
Get out quickly!

33:46.359 --> 33:47.359
There's a big problem!

33:47.519 --> 33:48.079
Put everything down and get out!

33:48.259 --> 33:48.950
What's wrong?

33:49.130 --> 33:50.189
What are you talking about?

33:50.289 --> 33:51.819
Stop the nonsense.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.720
The nuclear furnace is filled with
hydrogen and is about to explode!

33:55.900 --> 33:59.230
An emergency evacuation is being
conducted of the nearby villages,

33:59.369 --> 34:00.410
so we can't ventilate yet.

34:00.569 --> 34:01.900
If there's an explosion, we're
all dead!

34:02.069 --> 34:03.130
I said this would happen!

34:03.309 --> 34:04.369
Hurry, get out!

34:04.539 --> 34:06.269
Run!

34:18.789 --> 34:19.789
<i>Manager,</i>

34:19.889 --> 34:23.119
<i>the workers are leaving their
posts and running away!</i>

34:23.260 --> 34:26.018
Then there is no way to
reduce the pressure!

34:26.199 --> 34:27.750
<i>All of you!</i>

34:27.900 --> 34:29.230
<i>Why are you standing there?</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:31.300
<i>Get out!</i>

34:37.409 --> 34:38.929
Jae Hyeok!

34:39.110 --> 34:40.440
Get up quickly!

34:41.380 --> 34:43.280
Jae Hyeok!

34:43.480 --> 34:44.478
What should we do?

34:44.579 --> 34:45.610
Those damn bastards.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.480
What's going on?

34:46.650 --> 34:48.239
Why is the front exit blocked?

34:48.420 --> 34:52.389
The door closes automatically,
blocking the exit!

34:52.559 --> 34:54.518
We're supposed to die in here?

34:54.690 --> 34:55.719
It seems that way.

34:55.860 --> 34:56.389
Hyeongnim.

34:56.559 --> 34:58.360
Gil Seop, come and help.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.550
Okay!

35:19.719 --> 35:20.940
<i>Lift it up!</i>

35:23.889 --> 35:25.409
Find something to wedge this!

35:31.829 --> 35:33.920
What are you all doing?

35:35.099 --> 35:36.900
Hurry and get back to work!

35:37.000 --> 35:39.369
Until it's confirmed to be safe,
no one can leave!

35:39.469 --> 35:41.309
Isn't this place about to explode?

35:41.409 --> 35:43.570
Do you think if you run now
you'll be able to live?

35:43.670 --> 35:47.110
Whether you're 10 or 100 km
away, you're still going to die!

35:47.210 --> 35:49.910
If we die, we should all die
with our families.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.010
Let us out.

35:51.110 --> 35:52.579
Do you still not understand me?

35:52.679 --> 35:53.950
Get back to work quickly.

35:54.050 --> 35:57.019
That's the only way to save
your families and yourselves.

35:57.119 --> 36:01.189
Cut the bullshit and open
this door!

36:01.289 --> 36:04.730
I said the door won't open
until it's confirmed to be safe.

36:08.630 --> 36:10.099
You bastards.

36:14.070 --> 36:16.039
Let me go in. I have to go in.

36:16.139 --> 36:17.240
Get out of here!

36:17.340 --> 36:20.280
Why won't you let me in? Why?

36:20.380 --> 36:21.410
Get out of the way!

36:21.510 --> 36:23.709
There's an emergency
situation and you can't go in!

36:23.809 --> 36:24.680
Go back!

36:24.780 --> 36:26.780
My son is in there, you idiots!

36:26.880 --> 36:28.320
Go back. Get out of here!

36:34.260 --> 36:36.519
- Gil Seop!
- Don't go in there!

36:41.099 --> 36:42.800
It's more than 400 kPa!

36:42.900 --> 36:45.030
Pressure values are rising rapidly!

36:46.469 --> 36:48.730
Make the call!

36:52.139 --> 36:54.439
It's really annoying.

36:54.539 --> 36:57.709
I'm sure something must have
happened.

36:57.809 --> 36:58.749
What do you mean?

36:58.849 --> 37:00.280
Just be quiet back there!

37:00.380 --> 37:02.909
<i>How is the evacuation going?</i>

37:03.250 --> 37:05.490
<i>Wolchon, Eunhang, Gangnae,
Juhwa, Ingye, and others.</i>

37:05.590 --> 37:07.990
<i>More than 17,000 people
surrounding the power plant.</i>

37:08.090 --> 37:13.760
<i>They're being evacuated to a designated
shelter 10 km away from the power plant.</i>

37:13.860 --> 37:16.829
<i>But Highway 36 is the only
evacuation route,</i>

37:16.929 --> 37:19.970
<i>so there's a very serious
traffic jam.</i>

37:20.070 --> 37:22.070
How much longer until the
evacuation is completed?

37:22.170 --> 37:25.659
With the current conditions,
at least 2 more hours.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.139
How is the situation at the
power plant?

37:27.239 --> 37:30.349
The pressure value is 3 times
the normal limit.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.019
We can't delay any further.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.619
It must be vented immediately.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.590
We must wait until all residents
are evacuated.

37:35.690 --> 37:37.189
For the sake of just 17,000
people,

37:37.289 --> 37:40.389
do you want to sink an entire
country of 50 million into crisis?

37:40.489 --> 37:42.590
Those 17,000 people are also
our citizens.

37:42.690 --> 37:47.260
No one has the right to sacrifice them
for the sake of 50 million people!

37:51.199 --> 37:53.470
Manager, it's past 500!

37:53.570 --> 37:54.910
Can we open the vent?

37:55.010 --> 37:56.139
They said we need to wait.

37:56.239 --> 37:58.500
It has already exceeded the
peak explosion value!

37:59.309 --> 38:00.610
Manager.

38:02.250 --> 38:03.349
Open the vent.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.119
Manager, what are you doing?

38:05.219 --> 38:06.579
We have not received the
order yet.

38:06.679 --> 38:08.949
If we keep waiting, everyone
will die!

38:10.150 --> 38:12.309
Carry out the order and open
the vent!

38:12.719 --> 38:14.189
Open the ventilation system
emergency valve!

38:14.289 --> 38:16.760
Ventilation system emergency
valve, open the vent!

38:16.860 --> 38:18.159
Open the vent!

38:20.760 --> 38:21.729
Okay.

38:21.829 --> 38:22.989
Okay!

38:23.300 --> 38:24.559
Open!

38:27.800 --> 38:30.570
Manager, it won't open.

38:31.739 --> 38:34.579
Manager, the vent can be
opened manually!

38:34.679 --> 38:36.309
- Go get the plans.
- Yes.

38:37.409 --> 38:38.809
Bring them quickly!

38:39.050 --> 38:40.220
520!

38:40.320 --> 38:41.510
Here it is.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.150
530!

38:45.690 --> 38:46.789
540!

38:46.889 --> 38:48.559
It's here. The pressure
suppression chamber.

38:48.659 --> 38:49.559
<i>550!</i>

38:49.659 --> 38:50.849
Hurry!

38:55.670 --> 38:57.229
It's right here. Right here.

38:57.329 --> 38:58.499
You must open it quickly!

38:58.599 --> 38:59.829
I understand.

39:07.980 --> 39:09.709
All of you!

39:09.809 --> 39:11.250
Get back to work!

39:20.659 --> 39:22.420
- Come help!
- Okay.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.599
What are you doing? Hurry up!

39:29.699 --> 39:31.199
I can't do it.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.030
We're going to die!

39:34.269 --> 39:36.110
- Everyone run!
- Calm down.

39:36.210 --> 39:38.479
Jae Hyeok, we have to run.

39:38.579 --> 39:40.539
Wait a minute. I've almost
got it.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.349
We have to find another way out!

39:42.449 --> 39:44.650
The other way is the same.
Just wait!

39:44.750 --> 39:47.119
Then you take care.

39:47.219 --> 39:48.739
I'm leaving first.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.389
580!

39:55.489 --> 39:58.289
Get it open! Hurry!

39:58.860 --> 39:59.959
That's it. That's it.

40:00.059 --> 40:01.289
It will open!

40:01.630 --> 40:06.070
Gil Seop, come back! I got it
open!

40:06.340 --> 40:08.090
Go back, quickly!

40:09.409 --> 40:10.659
Got it!

40:38.239 --> 40:39.999
What was that sound?

40:40.099 --> 40:41.639
It came from the power plant
over there.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.000
Don't tell me...

41:07.559 --> 41:08.599
Gil Seop.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.889
Jin Taek. Kong Su hyeong.

41:16.369 --> 41:17.570
Where are you guys?

41:20.880 --> 41:22.709
Yong Su! Yong Su!

41:22.809 --> 41:25.380
Yong Su. Wake up, Yong Su.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.249
Yong Su, get up! You can't die!

41:28.349 --> 41:31.490
Get up, Yong Su. Get up!

41:31.590 --> 41:32.750
Yong Su.

41:33.789 --> 41:37.449
Yong Su, you can't die!
Yong Su!

41:41.230 --> 41:42.930
Jin Taek. Jin Taek.

41:43.030 --> 41:44.099
Jin Taek.

41:44.199 --> 41:47.869
Jin Taek, wake up! Come on!

41:47.969 --> 41:50.199
You can't die, kid!

41:53.710 --> 41:55.610
It can't be!

41:59.219 --> 42:00.479
Jae Hyeok.

42:00.579 --> 42:03.920
Gil Seop. Gil Seop!

42:07.989 --> 42:09.789
How are you?

42:11.460 --> 42:13.519
Just hold on. I'll get you
out of here.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.130
Just hold on. Hold on.

42:32.380 --> 42:33.849
Jae Hyeok.

42:34.750 --> 42:37.249
Help me. Help me.

42:37.349 --> 42:39.820
Jae Hyeok, help me.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.190
Ajussi!

42:42.030 --> 42:45.480
Get up and confirm the status.

42:45.630 --> 42:47.959
What should we do?

42:48.059 --> 42:49.030
I will report to you as soon
as possible.

42:49.130 --> 42:50.570
<i>Clear your heads.</i>

42:51.070 --> 42:53.730
<i>If you can move, go help the
injured!</i>

42:55.570 --> 42:57.099
Department Head!

43:06.920 --> 43:08.419
What are you all doing?

43:08.519 --> 43:10.949
Be strong. Get it together!

43:11.150 --> 43:14.990
Starting now, we must contain
the danger area.

43:15.090 --> 43:18.260
Residents within a 20 km radius must
undergo emergency evacuation training.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.959
Issue a city evacuation order.

43:20.059 --> 43:23.169
Cordon off an area in a radius
of 10 km or less,

43:23.269 --> 43:25.269
with strict control of access.

43:25.369 --> 43:27.639
We cannot allow information
to leak out.

43:27.739 --> 43:30.039
What do you think you're
doing right now?

43:30.139 --> 43:32.800
Do you have any better ideas?

43:33.809 --> 43:36.209
If we release the news of a nuclear
power plant explosion from here,

43:36.309 --> 43:38.550
and declare a national state of
emergency,

43:38.650 --> 43:41.220
then how far should we expand
the danger region?

43:41.320 --> 43:43.980
To 20 km? 30 km?

43:44.250 --> 43:46.559
Even at 20 km, there are
nearly 940,000 people.

43:46.659 --> 43:49.449
Where are those 940,000
people going to go?

43:49.760 --> 43:52.630
If they have nowhere to go,
they will roam the streets.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.999
At 30 km are another
3.4 million people,

43:55.099 --> 43:56.329
who will also start to panic.

43:56.429 --> 43:59.369
Then Daegu, Daejeon, all the
way to Seoul.

43:59.469 --> 44:02.269
There will be a chain reaction
and instant collapse!

44:02.369 --> 44:04.240
In addition, all nuclear power
plants must stop,

44:04.340 --> 44:06.209
so there will be a large-scale
power outage.

44:06.309 --> 44:10.150
In the dark, all will be difficult
to control.

44:10.250 --> 44:14.150
Like zombies, there will be no
regard for law and order.

44:14.250 --> 44:16.519
Hundreds of millions of people.

44:16.619 --> 44:20.110
Do you really want to see
that kind of hell?

44:22.730 --> 44:24.409
If the explosion could have
been prevented,

44:25.230 --> 44:27.750
we would not be dealing with
this situation now.

44:29.469 --> 44:31.800
There is news of an explosion
at Hanbyul nuclear power plant.

44:31.900 --> 44:33.070
That is currently being confirmed.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.039
According to what we know,

44:35.139 --> 44:36.110
this afternoon around 2 p.m.,

44:36.210 --> 44:39.180
Hanbyul reactor ♪1 suffered
a small cooling water leak.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.579
We have issued an evacuation order
for residents within a 5 km radius.

44:42.679 --> 44:45.849
Repair work is currently under way.

44:45.949 --> 44:47.079
The government issued a red alert.

44:47.179 --> 44:49.050
Is a radioactive substance
leaking from the power station?

44:49.150 --> 44:51.419
The government has indeed
issued a red alert.

44:51.519 --> 44:53.889
But it is only a precautionary
measure.

44:53.989 --> 44:56.260
Then why the National Crisis
Management Office move?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
Is this an emergency situation?

44:57.460 --> 45:00.130
This is only a precautionary
measure.

45:00.230 --> 45:01.229
The news conference is over.

45:01.329 --> 45:04.999
<i>Question! Please wait!
Wait a moment!</i>

45:05.099 --> 45:09.110
<i>Gil Seop!</i>

45:09.210 --> 45:10.010
Ajussi!

45:10.110 --> 45:10.910
Father!

45:11.010 --> 45:15.349
Gil Seop!

45:15.449 --> 45:16.979
Father!

45:17.079 --> 45:19.950
Aigoo kid, what happened?

45:20.050 --> 45:21.949
Father.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.579
What are you doing? Hurry!

45:25.820 --> 45:28.860
You blockheads should have
come out!

45:28.960 --> 45:31.059
Why did you stay here? Why?

45:31.159 --> 45:36.229
<i>Hyeongnim, help me!</i>

45:36.329 --> 45:37.360
Hyeongnim!

45:37.829 --> 45:39.169
<i>Hyeongnim!</i>

45:39.269 --> 45:42.209
<i>I told you that someday there
would be a disaster.</i>

45:42.309 --> 45:44.170
What is going on?

45:44.570 --> 45:48.450
If you didn't see it, then what
are you talking about?

45:48.550 --> 45:50.249
Department chief! Department
chief!

45:50.349 --> 45:51.610
Department chief.

45:51.710 --> 45:52.950
Quiet.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.479
What exactly is going on?

45:54.579 --> 45:56.590
I don't know the details, either.

45:56.690 --> 45:59.019
If you don't know, who does?

45:59.789 --> 46:02.090
We're currently trying to
understand the situation.

46:02.190 --> 46:04.729
For now, we need everyone to
go into the shelter.

46:04.829 --> 46:06.090
All of you please go inside.

46:10.030 --> 46:12.900
Mother-in-law, we can't stay here.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.169
We need to go further away.

46:14.269 --> 46:16.340
Keep your mouth shut.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.139
<i>Everyone, please calm down.</i>

46:19.239 --> 46:21.510
In a time like this, order must
be maintained.

46:21.610 --> 46:24.550
Don't be too worried and just
stay inside.

46:24.650 --> 46:26.220
That is the best thing to do.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.550
You jackass!

46:28.650 --> 46:29.780
Go inside.

46:30.050 --> 46:32.079
Min Jae, let's go inside.

46:47.670 --> 46:48.740
Captain.

46:48.840 --> 46:49.809
How is the situation?

46:49.909 --> 46:52.639
The main building exploded.
Damage to internal facilities.

46:52.739 --> 46:54.309
The situation is extremely bad.

46:54.409 --> 46:55.709
Inside it's simply hell! Hell.

46:55.809 --> 46:56.849
Why is everyone still outside?

46:56.949 --> 47:00.749
We wanted to go inside, but
radiation value is over 300.

47:00.849 --> 47:02.189
Inside, the values must be
even higher.

47:02.289 --> 47:05.309
Even wearing all the safety
equipment won't block it.

47:17.599 --> 47:18.690
Oppa, where are you?

47:23.570 --> 47:24.139
Oppa!

47:24.239 --> 47:26.170
Bring people out quickly and
leave quickly!

47:26.679 --> 47:27.939
Oppa!

47:28.039 --> 47:29.550
You can't go in there!

47:29.650 --> 47:32.619
I have to go in! My husband
is in there!

47:32.719 --> 47:34.450
It's extremely dangerous in there!

47:34.550 --> 47:36.519
Let go of me! Let go!

47:36.619 --> 47:39.590
Husband! Husband!

47:39.690 --> 47:40.820
Yes.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.650
- Leave quickly!
- What?

47:45.559 --> 47:47.059
<i>Has rescue work begun yet?</i>

47:47.159 --> 47:51.939
Currently, 11 fire brigades and 12 rescue teams
throughout the Busan region are mobilized.

47:52.039 --> 47:54.639
We are rapidly expanding relief work.

47:54.739 --> 47:58.070
=We will report to you as soon as the
casualties and injured are calculated.=.

47:58.170 --> 47:59.639
Continue rescue efforts.

47:59.739 --> 48:01.139
What about repair work?

48:01.239 --> 48:06.720
The only method now is to use holes from the
explosion to pour water in from the outside.

48:06.820 --> 48:09.249
After radiation levels drop,

48:09.349 --> 48:13.389
we can enter the power plant and
ensure that cooling water is flowing.

48:13.489 --> 48:14.389
Did you hear that?

48:14.489 --> 48:18.760
Please try every means to cool
down the reactor.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.059
We're almost there. Keep
going.

48:21.159 --> 48:23.289
Just keep going!

48:25.539 --> 48:27.099
Where did you all come from?

48:27.199 --> 48:28.669
Near the north exit.

48:28.769 --> 48:29.740
Is anyone else hurt?

48:29.840 --> 48:33.979
See for yourself. It's absolute
hell!

48:34.079 --> 48:36.510
Please go help them.

48:36.949 --> 48:38.349
Let's go.

48:41.349 --> 48:43.249
Rescue team!

48:43.349 --> 48:45.820
Stop! Stop!

48:45.920 --> 48:48.789
Rescue team, please help us!

48:49.230 --> 48:50.889
Quickly. Quickly.

48:50.989 --> 48:52.260
Come over here, hurry!

48:56.170 --> 48:57.500
Please help us!

48:59.070 --> 49:01.910
Why are you all still outside?
People are dying in there!

49:02.010 --> 49:04.970
We can't go in. Radiation level
is too high.

49:05.070 --> 49:06.110
Come on, quickly!

49:06.210 --> 49:07.679
Hurry!

49:08.010 --> 49:09.680
I can't.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.349
Why are you standing there?

49:11.449 --> 49:13.179
Gil Seop!

49:13.380 --> 49:15.289
Spray water on everything in there.

49:15.389 --> 49:17.220
That's the only way to reduce
radiation levels.

49:17.320 --> 49:20.720
The road must be kept open,
so we can go in to help people.

49:20.820 --> 49:23.130
What's going on? Why are you
all just standing here?

49:23.230 --> 49:24.930
You're all just watching people
die in there!

49:25.030 --> 49:26.630
We're doing all we can.

49:26.730 --> 49:28.530
Go inside and help them!

49:28.630 --> 49:30.200
Let go!

49:30.300 --> 49:31.869
A lot of people are still inside!

49:31.969 --> 49:35.470
- Hurry!
- Sir, let go!

49:35.570 --> 49:37.809
- Oppa!
- Yeon Ju!

49:37.909 --> 49:40.209
What happened?
Why are you here?

49:40.309 --> 49:42.510
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

49:42.610 --> 49:44.309
I'm okay.

49:44.409 --> 49:45.450
What about you?

49:45.550 --> 49:46.479
I'm fine.

49:46.579 --> 49:48.280
Mother, sister-in-law, and Min Jae?

49:48.380 --> 49:51.519
They're in the shelter. Let's go.

49:51.619 --> 49:54.219
<i>Please help us! Help us!</i>

49:55.159 --> 49:57.750
<i>There are many injured people
inside!</i>

49:58.530 --> 49:59.900
= Attention, team members.=

50:00.000 --> 50:03.659
=Until radiation levels decrease,
please stand by on site.=

50:04.030 --> 50:07.840
=Wait for further orders from
headquarters.=

50:07.940 --> 50:13.479
=I repeat. Until radiation levels
decrease, please stand by on site.=

50:13.579 --> 50:16.880
=Wait for further orders from
headquarters.=.

50:18.309 --> 50:20.039
What's wrong with you?

50:22.219 --> 50:25.320
Yeon Ju, you leave first.

50:25.420 --> 50:26.990
Take our whole family far away.

50:27.090 --> 50:29.360
Run very far, understand?

50:29.460 --> 50:30.590
What are you talking about?

50:30.690 --> 50:31.999
Ajussi!

50:32.099 --> 50:34.430
Take Gil Seob and Kang Suk,
and leave now!

50:34.530 --> 50:35.800
You must leave, too.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.630
Oppa, where are you going?

50:37.730 --> 50:38.999
Are you crazy?

50:39.099 --> 50:40.669
Why do you want to go back?

50:40.769 --> 50:42.410
Jae Hyeok!

50:42.510 --> 50:46.010
I can't leave them alone in
there! I have to go back inside.

50:46.110 --> 50:48.680
Why would you want to go
back in there?

50:48.780 --> 50:50.709
The rescue team is here!

50:50.809 --> 50:52.849
Come back here, you idiot!

50:52.949 --> 50:54.519
When are they going inside?

50:54.619 --> 50:55.749
Ajussi, you leave now.

50:55.849 --> 50:56.720
You go, too.

50:56.820 --> 50:58.119
Oppa, don't go in there!

50:58.219 --> 50:59.559
You'll die if you do.

50:59.659 --> 51:01.820
Get out of here, brat!

51:01.920 --> 51:02.959
Take her away.

51:03.059 --> 51:04.760
Come back, Jae Hyeok!

51:04.860 --> 51:08.660
- Oppa! Oppa!
- Jae Hyeok! Jae Hyeok!

51:08.760 --> 51:12.070
Why are you all standing here?
Go in and save those people!

51:12.170 --> 51:14.400
<i>Hurry and go!</i>

51:14.969 --> 51:19.439
Listen carefully! This is not
something that will burn itself out.

51:19.539 --> 51:21.869
If it's left unchecked,
everyone will die!

51:26.820 --> 51:29.550
The radiation levels keep rising.

51:29.650 --> 51:31.449
Damn it.

51:31.650 --> 51:35.160
Team 1, keep the road open.
Team 2, prepare to spray water.

51:35.260 --> 51:36.490
Captain, the levels...

51:36.590 --> 51:40.030
Didn't you hear? That thing is
not going to burn itself out.

51:40.130 --> 51:43.690
If we go in, we die. If we keep
standing out here, we will die.

51:45.670 --> 51:47.230
I understand.

51:47.599 --> 51:49.070
You all heard, right?

51:49.170 --> 51:50.910
Everything goes in!

51:51.010 --> 51:53.369
Everyone to your places!

51:55.809 --> 51:57.280
Let us go in, too.

51:57.380 --> 52:01.110
Rescue team will go in when
the radiation levels drop.

52:20.570 --> 52:23.230
Be careful. Be careful.

52:23.840 --> 52:26.539
You can't go in.

52:26.639 --> 52:29.249
I was also in the power plant!

52:29.349 --> 52:30.710
Get out of the way!

52:33.619 --> 52:34.639
Gil Seop.

52:35.590 --> 52:37.349
Gil Seop.

53:04.909 --> 53:06.150
Gil Seop.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.940
Hurry.

53:08.179 --> 53:09.320
Get ready.

53:09.420 --> 53:10.220
It's ready!

53:10.320 --> 53:12.650
Get out of the way!

53:14.489 --> 53:15.760
Hold him down!

53:15.860 --> 53:16.559
Yes.

53:16.659 --> 53:17.789
Gil Seop.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.930
It exploded! It already exploded!

53:23.030 --> 53:24.329
What are you talking about?

53:24.429 --> 53:28.570
I was there! The power plant
exploded and everything is in chaos!

53:28.670 --> 53:30.039
What's this ridiculous story?

53:30.139 --> 53:32.510
There is dust on my clothes.

53:32.610 --> 53:34.439
Go measure the radiation
on them!

53:34.539 --> 53:36.070
We can't stay here!

53:36.309 --> 53:37.610
Mom.

53:39.679 --> 53:42.150
<i>Attention all citizens.</i>

53:42.250 --> 53:46.280
<i>We are currently confirming the
situation with headquarters.</i>

53:46.789 --> 53:49.630
<i>We will distribute food and
other necessary items.</i>

53:49.730 --> 53:57.730
<i>Please ask the staff members
and they will bring it to you.</i>

54:06.309 --> 54:07.939
Child, where have you been?

54:08.039 --> 54:10.610
Mom, the power plant really
did explode.

54:10.710 --> 54:12.749
- What?
- What did you say?

54:12.849 --> 54:14.079
Are you sure?

54:14.179 --> 54:14.919
Yes.

54:15.019 --> 54:16.119
How is that possible?

54:16.219 --> 54:18.019
I saw it with my own eyes!

54:18.119 --> 54:20.619
What should we do? What should we do?

54:20.719 --> 54:22.160
What do we do?

54:22.260 --> 54:23.360
We can't stay here.

54:23.460 --> 54:24.530
We have to leave quickly.

54:24.630 --> 54:25.760
Go where?

54:25.860 --> 54:27.420
The farther the better.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.499
That's what I said, you jerk.

54:29.599 --> 54:32.030
I said a long time ago it
would explode.

54:36.570 --> 54:39.079
Everyone, listen up.

54:39.179 --> 54:41.369
The power plant has exploded.

54:42.010 --> 54:43.579
Everyone needs to leave quickly!

54:43.679 --> 54:45.010
Really? Are you certain?

54:45.110 --> 54:47.180
I just came from there.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.320
The whole top has blown off!

54:49.420 --> 54:51.619
<i>Radiation is leaking out from
there!</i>

54:51.719 --> 54:53.789
If we stay here, we're all
going to die!

54:53.889 --> 54:56.920
Jae Hyeok? What about Jae Hyeok?

54:57.659 --> 55:00.499
Yeon Ju, what about Jae Hyeok?
How is Jae Hyeok?

55:00.599 --> 55:03.389
Don't worry. Oppa is fine.

55:03.969 --> 55:04.800
Thank goodness.

55:04.900 --> 55:06.240
Then why didn't he come
here with you?

55:06.340 --> 55:08.639
There's a crazy traffic jam.

55:08.739 --> 55:09.939
How could such a thing happen?

55:10.039 --> 55:11.969
Go! Everyone go, quickly!

55:18.050 --> 55:20.550
What? What?

55:20.650 --> 55:21.980
These assholes.

55:23.489 --> 55:25.789
You bastards, why have you
locked the door?

55:25.889 --> 55:27.619
Do you want us to die?

55:27.719 --> 55:29.959
Rotten bastards! How can you
treat us like this?

55:30.059 --> 55:32.090
You damn bastards, open the
door!

55:32.190 --> 55:34.200
Open this door!

55:34.300 --> 55:36.829
Are we prisoners? Why are we
locked in here?

55:36.929 --> 55:38.970
Open this door!

55:39.070 --> 55:42.440
Open the door. The radiation
will spread here soon!

55:44.340 --> 55:47.369
Go in there! Tell them to shut up!

55:51.610 --> 55:52.880
<i>Why isn't my phone working?</i>

55:53.280 --> 55:56.450
<i>I can't get the internet
or anything.</i>

55:56.550 --> 55:58.039
<i>What's going on here?</i>

56:22.750 --> 56:25.309
<i>Hold on a while longer.
We're almost done.</i>

56:25.409 --> 56:27.280
<i>We will get you out.</i>

56:31.719 --> 56:32.980
<i>Help me.</i>

56:34.489 --> 56:35.889
<i>Please help us!</i>

56:36.289 --> 56:38.689
<i>Please help us!</i>

56:38.789 --> 56:41.499
Jin Taek! Jin Taek!

56:41.599 --> 56:44.289
Jin Taek, are you okay?

56:44.599 --> 56:45.970
I can't move my legs.

56:46.070 --> 56:48.300
Wait, I'll get you out.

56:49.340 --> 56:51.639
This is coolant water. You have
to get him out quickly.

56:51.739 --> 56:52.780
He's all wet!

56:52.880 --> 56:55.500
First block it, then lift it from
the bottom.

56:55.809 --> 56:57.010
Hold him.

56:57.110 --> 56:59.349
Lift it up. Use some strength!
Use some strength!

56:59.449 --> 57:01.780
- It moved a little.
- Okay.

57:02.019 --> 57:02.939
No time to lose. Hurry, hurry.

57:03.039 --> 57:05.389
No time to lose. Hurry, hurry.

57:05.489 --> 57:06.860
We have to get out of here.

57:06.960 --> 57:14.889
Don't worry, we'll help you.

57:26.610 --> 57:29.940
What happened? The level
keeps rising.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.680
Rescue team!

57:31.780 --> 57:34.419
Captain, some victims are
coming out!

57:34.519 --> 57:36.579
Ambulance. Ambulance! Hurry!

57:40.489 --> 57:42.559
Be careful. Be careful.

57:42.659 --> 57:44.019
Be careful.

57:44.230 --> 57:45.329
Check radiation levels first.

57:45.429 --> 57:46.930
Take him out. I'll come later.

57:47.030 --> 57:48.860
Transfer him quickly!

57:50.400 --> 57:51.400
You go with them.

57:51.500 --> 57:54.039
What are you talking about?
Our people are in there.

57:54.139 --> 57:55.169
I'm fine.

57:55.269 --> 57:56.769
It's too dangerous in there.

57:56.869 --> 57:58.769
The radiation is too high!

58:00.809 --> 58:01.969
Hey!

58:03.409 --> 58:06.539
Hey. Wake up! Wake up!

58:08.250 --> 58:11.050
Rescue team!

58:12.219 --> 58:14.349
Transfer him quickly!

58:17.159 --> 58:18.889
We must go in!

58:19.400 --> 58:21.630
Prepare the equipment and
follow me!

58:32.610 --> 58:34.939
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

58:35.039 --> 58:37.170
Where are they going?

58:37.449 --> 58:39.950
Hey, you haven't sprayed the
water. Where are they going?

58:40.050 --> 58:41.050
Are they leaving?

58:41.150 --> 58:44.019
We're empty. We have to go
refill the water.

58:44.119 --> 58:45.420
What?

58:48.760 --> 58:51.489
What the hell are you doing?
Send a helicopter quickly!

58:51.989 --> 58:55.099
- This isn't the time to worry about
responsibility... - What are you doing?

58:55.199 --> 58:58.300
The sea has an endless water
supply. Where are they going?

58:58.400 --> 59:01.169
If that reactor doesn't get water,
there will be a disaster!

59:01.269 --> 59:02.639
They said seawater couldn't
be used.

59:02.739 --> 59:04.070
Who said that?

59:04.170 --> 59:06.570
We have no other choice.

59:10.280 --> 59:13.619
Who are you? That guy says
they can't use seawater.

59:13.719 --> 59:16.820
Those were the instructions
from headquarters.

59:16.920 --> 59:21.150
Spray seawater and the reactor
will be ruined. You know, right?

59:23.059 --> 59:25.900
You stupid bunch of bastards.

59:26.000 --> 59:31.369
Meltdown, a meltdown. There
has been a huge explosion.

59:31.469 --> 59:33.269
That reactor is already trash!

59:33.369 --> 59:34.439
Does it make any sense to
save it?

59:34.539 --> 59:37.809
No one knows the conditions inside.

59:37.909 --> 59:40.010
Don't you know how much
that reactor cost?

59:40.110 --> 59:42.780
If there's a mistake, will you
take responsibility?

59:42.880 --> 59:45.679
That's right! I'll be responsible!

59:47.150 --> 59:51.090
I'll take responsibility. Fill up
with seawater immediately!

59:51.190 --> 59:55.920
My superiors also issued
instructions not to use seawater.

59:56.059 --> 59:57.789
I'm sorry.

59:58.059 --> 59:59.059
Crazy bastards.

59:59.159 --> 01:00:00.449
What's wrong?

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:01.829
What's wrong with you?

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:02.530
What's wrong?

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.099
Are you okay?

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:06.740
What's wrong with me?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.269
It's radiation exposure.

01:00:08.369 --> 01:00:11.209
How will I be? Am I going to die?

01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:13.010
What are you talking about,
you blockhead!

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.880
How can you die?

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.940
Isn't that Jae Hyeok and
Jin Taek?

01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:20.650
Jae Hyeok! Jae Hyeok!

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.849
Patient, wake up!

01:00:22.949 --> 01:00:24.820
Quickly remove his clothes.
Confirm vital signs.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.820
270/50.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.760
Jae Hyeok!

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.380
Jin Taek.

01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:33.729
I told you to go out, but you
wouldn't listen.

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:36.400
Jae Hyeok. Hang on, Jae Hyeok!

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.190
Don't watch.

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.240
<i>Atomic Energy Research Inst.
Has written "AtomCARE."</i>

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.110
<i>They launched a radiation
detection system.</i>

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:53.280
Detailed information will be
provided within 1 hour.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.950
Presently, the wind direction
is blowing inland.

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:59.780
Pretty soon, radiation outside
the blockade area will be detected.

01:01:01.019 --> 01:01:02.289
I understand.

01:01:02.389 --> 01:01:07.160
Let's make sure the President
doesn't see this.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.699
I understand.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:10.889
<i>Prime Minister!</i>

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.510
The media is asking us to give accurate
information about the nuclear power plant.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.809
They say they are getting
reports from many people.

01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:24.010
Rumors or gossip.

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:27.579
Whoever publishes that will be
punished severely.

01:01:27.679 --> 01:01:29.019
Give them that warning.

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:31.590
<i>- Get out of the way!
- Let us go!</i>

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:36.019
Aigoo. What do we do?
What should we do?

01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:39.130
Was this your plan?

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.860
What?

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.430
Radiation is spreading, but
we're locked up here.

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:44.200
It's all because of you.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.960
If you hadn't been so stubborn,
we could have run farther.

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:49.369
Daughter-in-law.

01:01:49.469 --> 01:01:53.280
You should know. You know
how horrific radiation is.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.439
You saw it when Father passed
away.

01:01:55.539 --> 01:02:00.220
His skin burned and bones
melted.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.820
You saw how terrible it was.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.349
If we're not lucky, Min Jae will die of
the same thing that killed his father!

01:02:04.449 --> 01:02:06.289
Eonni, that's enough.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.389
I'm not finished!

01:02:08.489 --> 01:02:11.389
For small children like Min Jae,
the effect is even more deadly.

01:02:11.489 --> 01:02:14.099
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to all of you.

01:02:14.199 --> 01:02:17.789
I really never expected it would
come to this.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.300
Mommy, why are you mad at
Grandma?

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.639
Don't talk. Keep your mouth
closed.

01:02:25.739 --> 01:02:26.840
Min Jae, be quiet.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.410
Put on the mask, the mask.

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:32.180
Everyone, put on your masks!

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.579
Cover your mouth! Your mouth!

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:23.200
Jae Hyeok, wake up.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.059
Wake up, Kid.

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.969
Over here! Over here! Nurse!

01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:31.300
Jae Hyeok! Jae Hyeok!

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.070
Jae Hyeok, how are you?
Wake up, kid!

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.459
Come down lower!

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:55.229
Not there! Come down lower!

01:03:55.329 --> 01:03:55.961
Captain.

01:03:56.061 --> 01:03:58.130
If we continue, our brothers
will also die.

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.570
Until we die, we have to keep
going!

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.479
Manager.

01:04:07.579 --> 01:04:08.340
Rescue team! Rescue team!

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.710
Rescue team, quickly!

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.749
Manager, why are you still here?

01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:18.320
Transfer him quickly.

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:19.760
What is the radiation level?

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.860
That monster is still burning
in there.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.760
Why hasn't this monster
died yet?

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.960
This method isn't working to
reduce the radiation!

01:04:33.099 --> 01:04:35.429
Manager! Manager!

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.300
Are you alright?

01:04:38.969 --> 01:04:40.269
I'm fine.

01:04:41.639 --> 01:04:43.280
I'm fine.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.679
<i>A catastrophe!</i>

01:04:44.949 --> 01:04:47.880
IAEA is aware of this accident.
[International Atomic Energy Agency]

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.320
What are you talking about?
[International Atomic Energy Agency]

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.019
Next to the reactor building,

01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:52.320
there is a heatsink.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.519
There is a heatsink.

01:04:53.619 --> 01:04:58.389
Above that is a CCTV monitor that
sends video to the IAEA in real time.

01:04:58.489 --> 01:05:01.130
All nuclear power plants in the
world are equipped this way.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.229
So what?

01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:03.769
Through this video,

01:05:03.869 --> 01:05:08.970
they found out that the fluid level in the
cooling water tank for Hanbyul ♪1 is decreased.

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:11.970
Just a moment. The level of cooling
water in the tank has dropped.

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:13.209
What does that mean?

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:17.050
I'm afraid there is a leak
somewhere from the explosion.

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:21.119
The tank and the reactor that exploded
are separated by a concrete wall.

01:05:21.219 --> 01:05:23.650
It cannot draw water from
the water tank...

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.150
What if the tank water level
continues to drop?

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:29.889
<i>400 tons of spent nuclear fuel rods are
immersed in the No. 1 tank cooling water.</i>

01:05:29.989 --> 01:05:31.689
<i>If the cooling water level decreases,</i>

01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:33.630
<i>and the spent nuclear fuel rods
touch the air,</i>

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.130
there will be a massive explosion
of them and the reactor.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.229
The spent fuel rods will melt and the
reactor core will go into meltdown.

01:05:39.329 --> 01:05:41.169
There is only a concrete wall.

01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:46.139
If it explodes, a huge amount of
radiation will be released into the air.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.380
We must face the facts.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.880
Hundreds of tons of dangerous
spent nuclear fuel rods,

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.919
surrounded by only a concrete
wall, how is that possible?

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:59.019
We have no facilities to dispose of
spent nuclear fuel rods domestically.

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:00.119
So temporarily...

01:06:00.219 --> 01:06:02.459
Why are you looking for excuses?

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.059
I'm sorry.

01:06:05.889 --> 01:06:09.630
One reactor has put us into
such a predicament.

01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:12.869
There is still a more important
problem.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.499
What is it?

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:17.669
<i>China, Japan and other countries
will follow the lead of America,</i>

01:06:17.769 --> 01:06:20.309
<i>and notify their citizens to
immediately return home.</i>

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:23.940
<i>Everything will then become
public knowledge.</i>

01:06:37.429 --> 01:06:39.760
<i>Withdraw! Everyone withdraw!</i>

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.659
<i>Leave quickly!</i>

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:51.240
Mother-in-law, get up quickly.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.840
Eonni, get up!

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.979
The police outside are running
away.

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:55.809
Why?

01:06:55.909 --> 01:06:56.610
I don't know.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:59.579
I don't know what happened,
but it must be very bad.

01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:01.550
We have to hurry and go!

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.090
Everyone, get up quickly!

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:07.689
The people outside have run away.

01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:09.860
<i>We have to hurry and go.</i>

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.389
<i>Everybody leave together.</i>

01:07:11.489 --> 01:07:13.900
Eonni, look after the children.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.930
Get up quickly.

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.289
Hurry and go!

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.809
Please help us open the door!

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.150
Where are you going?

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.889
We have to get out of here!

01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:40.780
Everybody come together!

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:06.170
Everyone get on the bus!

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:11.249
Take care of Min Jae.

01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:13.050
Go quickly!

01:08:14.119 --> 01:08:16.649
Mom, Eonni, don't fall behind.

01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:38.680
Ajussi, get up. I'll drive it.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.179
Hurry, hurry.

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:43.219
You're getting on?

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:43.990
Why? You're driving?

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:45.520
Just get on.

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:47.649
Everyone hold on tightly!

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.990
=Although we don't know the
exact reason, =

01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:55.759
=it is confirmed that yesterday afternoon, nuclear
reactor ♪1 exploded at the Hanbyul plant.=

01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:58.399
=Presently, nuclear power
plant staff and firemen=

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:04.210
=are attempting to cool the reactor in order
to begin repair work and avoid a meltdown.=

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:10.309
=But it is certain that there is already a
very large amount of radiation leakage.=.

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:12.549
Right now, that bunch of
damn guys

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.319
locked us up because they were
afraid it would be found out!

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.490
Those rotten bastards.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:19.490
Obviously they didn't care if
we lived or died.

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.290
Yeah, when do they ever think
about us?

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.460
How can they be like this?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.890
Are we not even human?

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.500
Aigoo, Yeon Ju. Slow down a bit.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.969
We don't have much time.

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:34.299
People will start filling the
streets.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:37.390
When that happens, we won't
even be able to walk.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.979
<i>This corresponds to the
government initiatives.</i>

01:09:41.078 --> 01:09:45.009
<i>The Army has cordoned off an
area within 20 km of the explosion.</i>

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:48.679
<i>Access is restricted for all vehicles.</i>

01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:52.819
<i>During this time, it is possible a large amount of
radiation will spread to the residential areas.</i>

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:58.850
<i>So, hundreds of thousands of
people will be exposed to radiation.</i>

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:07.989
Mi Suk!

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:08.960
We have to leave!

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.590
If we stay, we're going to die!

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:12.329
What?

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:33.760
<i>In this political society,</i>

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.329
<i>we would like to ask,</i>

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.800
<i>what exactly did the government do?</i>

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.090
What?

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.399
What's wrong? Come quickly!
Everyone has run away.

01:10:44.539 --> 01:10:46.399
How can people be like this?

01:10:46.569 --> 01:10:48.340
How can they just leave people
here?

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.810
Hurry and get the medicine.
It's all gone!

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.170
Okay.

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.840
What are you doing?

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.609
Hurry.

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.350
<i>Citizens of the United States,
China, Japan, and other countries,</i>

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:03.220
<i>as well as our own citizens are
in total confusion.</i>

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:06.659
<i>In other words, the present
condition is very desperate.</i>

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.699
<i>In the area located 20 km from
the Hanbyul nuclear reactors,</i>

01:11:10.869 --> 01:11:13.659
<i>the measured radiation value
was 100 mSv.</i>

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.329
<i>This is a thousand times the
normal value!</i>

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:18.939
<i>1000 times!</i>

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:28.880
<i>Even though our country is small,</i>

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.210
<i>there are a relatively large
number of nuclear power plants.</i>

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:35.289
<i>Due to the number of nuclear
power plants across the country,</i>

01:11:35.489 --> 01:11:40.479
<i>the damage from an accident
would be unimaginable.</i>

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.189
<i>In the Hanbyul nuclear power
plant leak accident,</i>

01:11:44.329 --> 01:11:50.000
<i>there will be at least 1.5 million
or more injured by radiation.</i>

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:53.329
<i>11.6% of this country will soon
become a land of death.</i>

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:57.000
<i>This is a fact.</i>

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.850
I told you to control the media!

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.750
Right now, every cat and dog
are out barking!

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.819
It's impossible to control them.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.909
The police and Army have also
lost control.

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:13.619
We have no control of the
situation.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.390
The operating system of this
country cannot be executed.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.000
Then...

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:21.569
this country... this country only
has the ability to stay here?

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:25.329
<i>Unfortunately, there is no
solution to nuclear radiation.</i>

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.529
<i>The current situation is getting worse.</i>

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.079
<i>The only way out of this situation,</i>

01:12:29.239 --> 01:12:33.199
<i>is to leave this country immediately.</i>

01:12:35.449 --> 01:12:38.319
<i>Please wait!</i>

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:39.890
- Nurse!
- Please just hold on.

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:41.720
This is a painkiller, right?

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:42.550
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

01:12:42.689 --> 01:12:44.210
Jae Hyeok.

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.090
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.260
Jae Hyeok, you woke up.

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:48.520
Are you alright? How are you
feeling?

01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:49.629
What are you doing?

01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:52.220
- Why are you like this?
- Where's my phone?

01:12:52.399 --> 01:12:53.370
- What are you doing?
- Looking for my phone!

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.630
My work clothes. Where are
my work clothes?

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.399
Where are his work clothes?

01:12:56.569 --> 01:12:58.270
His work clothes are in the
waste disposal room.

01:12:58.439 --> 01:13:00.239
Jae Hyeok!

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:02.810
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.550
<i>Look, what did I say?</i>

01:13:18.689 --> 01:13:20.030
<i>I told you, the sooner the better.</i>

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:22.319
<i>Shut up! What's the point in
talking about it now?</i>

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.399
<i>- What did you say?
- I said I can't. Stop talking.</i>

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.760
Oppa!

01:13:26.939 --> 01:13:28.060
How are you?

01:13:28.199 --> 01:13:29.000
What are you doing?

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:30.000
Where are you now?

01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:31.930
I'm on the highway.

01:13:32.069 --> 01:13:33.899
But there's too much traffic,
so we're going slowly.

01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:34.800
What about our family?

01:13:34.979 --> 01:13:35.939
We're together.

01:13:36.039 --> 01:13:38.340
Some of the other ladies and
men are here, too.

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.949
You can't stay there.

01:13:40.079 --> 01:13:42.380
No matter how, you have to
get away.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:43.540
As far as possible, understand?

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.409
As far as possible, understand?

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:45.490
What about you?

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:46.680
Where are you?

01:13:46.819 --> 01:13:47.939
Did something happen to you?

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.789
Please don't worry about me!

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.649
I'll catch up with you.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.119
Hello?

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.819
Hello?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.829
Child, was that Jae Hyeok?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.020
Yes.

01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:00.899
What did he say? Where is he now?

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.729
He said he'll catch up to us.

01:14:02.899 --> 01:14:04.460
That kid should be rushing
out of there!

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:07.439
What is he still doing there?

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.199
Have you been able to contact
So Jin's father?

01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:10.379
Not yet.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:12.409
What are they doing?

01:14:12.579 --> 01:14:13.810
Our Min Jae must be tired.

01:14:13.979 --> 01:14:15.420
Please put your mask back on.

01:14:15.579 --> 01:14:17.640
If this continues, we'll be
here forever.

01:14:17.819 --> 01:14:20.619
Look how fast the cars are
going on the other side.

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:23.550
<i>Are you crazy? Do you want to
drive back again?</i>

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:25.850
<i>Aigoo, that's enough.</i>

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.760
<i>I'm not allowed to talk?</i>

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.529
Everyone hold on tightly!

01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:32.220
What?

01:14:32.399 --> 01:14:33.869
<i>Yeon Ju, what are you doing?</i>

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.470
Just hold on!

01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:22.140
<i>Actions are being taken to cool
off Hanbyul reactor No. 1.</i>

01:15:22.319 --> 01:15:24.510
<i>But the surrounding radiation
level is too high.</i>

01:15:24.689 --> 01:15:27.149
<i>Firefighters and rescuers working
in the area were affected.</i>

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.689
<i>A lot of people are being
carried out.</i>

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.189
<i>Of course, repair work hasn't
been able to start yet.</i>

01:15:32.359 --> 01:15:38.060
<i>More serious is the condition of the
reservoir, which cannot yet be confirmed.</i>

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.870
<i>From the start of the incident
until now,</i>

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.090
<i>the government's responsibility
and countermeasures,</i>

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.859
<i>have been totally inadequate.</i>

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:44.839
<i>That bastard.</i>

01:15:44.939 --> 01:15:46.380
<i>While the government remains silent,</i>

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:49.770
<i>the entire country is sinking into
turmoil.</i>

01:15:49.909 --> 01:15:53.399
<i>Traffic in the major cities is now
seriously paralyzed.</i>

01:15:53.579 --> 01:15:56.050
<i>Not only is traffic tying up the
streets, basic supplies are running low.</i>

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.119
<i>Law and order are breaking down.</i>

01:15:58.289 --> 01:15:59.519
<i>Train stations, bus terminals,</i>

01:15:59.619 --> 01:16:02.350
are full of foreigners and
citizens trying to go abroad.

01:16:02.489 --> 01:16:05.250
<i>Airports and shipping ports are
jammed.</i>

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.060
<i>The location of Hanbyul nuclear power
plant, including Wonsan Enterprises,</i>

01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:12.170
<i>production of automobiles, oil
and chemicals has been interupted.</i>

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.359
<i>There will be huge economic losses.</i>

01:16:14.539 --> 01:16:16.300
<i>Stock market prices are falling
like a rock.</i>

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:20.000
<i>If this continues, the country
may not be able to recover.</i>

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.609
We must declare a state of
emergency,

01:16:21.779 --> 01:16:24.180
and impose martial law.

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:27.039
The fate of the country is at stake.

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.810
Should we just stand back
and watch?

01:16:28.979 --> 01:16:30.510
Jae Hyeok, what's wrong with you?

01:16:30.689 --> 01:16:32.350
I want to go and look for my family.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.079
Kid, you can't go anywhere
right now!

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.819
The roads are blocked! Where
can you go?

01:16:36.989 --> 01:16:37.989
I have to go anyway.

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.390
I'm responsible for my family!

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:42.500
Yeon Ju will take good care of them.

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.029
You need to take care of yourself!

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:46.529
I'm fine now. Get out of the way.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:48.189
I said move!

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.130
Jae Hyeok!

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:51.930
Jae Hyeok!

01:16:52.069 --> 01:16:55.300
Jae Hyeok!

01:16:55.479 --> 01:16:58.810
Nurse! Nurse!

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.149
The secretary told me to pack
my luggage.

01:17:02.319 --> 01:17:04.939
Is the situation really that bad?

01:17:06.619 --> 01:17:10.920
What are you doing now?
How can you be like this?

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:14.720
There's absolutely nothing
I can do.

01:17:14.859 --> 01:17:17.520
There's no way to stop it.

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:21.689
What do you want me to do?

01:17:22.899 --> 01:17:25.000
Take Mi Suk and leave quickly.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.800
Just follow Secretary Kim's
instructions.

01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:31.670
Where is Secretary Kim now?

01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:32.869
What?

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:35.279
After he gave you the secretary's
Line report,

01:17:35.449 --> 01:17:37.649
he was replaced.

01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:41.789
Didn't you even know?

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:45.319
Do you have any idea what's
going on right now?

01:17:45.489 --> 01:17:49.659
Are you giving up before even
understanding the situation?

01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:54.130
Mi Suk and I aren't going
anywhere.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.029
We will wait for you.

01:17:57.170 --> 01:18:02.109
Think about it carefully and
figure out what you're going to do.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.939
You need to take this call.

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:40.680
Who is it?

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:43.279
The President.

01:18:43.479 --> 01:18:45.949
I thought you would be the
best person.

01:18:46.119 --> 01:18:49.180
Hurry.

01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:59.359
This is nuclear power plant
manager, Pak Pyeong Seop.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.729
This is Gang Seok Ho.

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:05.460
Please... go ahead.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.739
Are you able to tell me the
truth about this situation?

01:19:09.909 --> 01:19:16.180
Now... do you finally want to
know?

01:19:17.989 --> 01:19:20.350
Where were you all this time?

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.649
Where were you and what did
you do?

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:31.529
Now, we must announce...

01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:34.960
From now on, I'm in control here.

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.760
Declare a state of emergency.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:38.739
Because of the complexity of
implementing an emergency order,

01:19:38.869 --> 01:19:41.600
the scope of effectiveness will
be determined by this room.

01:19:41.739 --> 01:19:44.640
Are we all agreed?

01:19:46.649 --> 01:19:48.439
I agree.

01:19:48.579 --> 01:19:50.880
<i>- I agree.
- I agree.</i>

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.850
Prime Minister.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.300
It must go through Parliament...

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.319
Of course, I already asked the
chairman for assistance.

01:19:56.489 --> 01:20:00.260
Right now, this policy is being
implemented in parliament.

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:01.330
I agree.

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:04.260
From now on, all information
that comes from the site

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.529
will be reported to me without
even one word missing.

01:20:06.699 --> 01:20:07.899
Yes, I understand.

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:08.859
Also,

01:20:09.039 --> 01:20:12.600
please immediately allow the
firefighters on site to use seawater.

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:14.600
Disable Hanbyul reactor No. 1.

01:20:14.779 --> 01:20:15.710
Mr. President!

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.710
All nuclear power plants in
every region of South Korea

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.279
must cease all operations
for now.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:22.710
No. They cannot stop operating.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.880
There are many other electricity-
generating facilities.

01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:26.210
They aren't being used now.

01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:27.750
If it's not enough, we can
conserve.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.359
If there is even one more problem
with a nuclear power plant right now,

01:20:31.529 --> 01:20:37.090
the entire country will lose hope.

01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:41.569
It's fine! It's fine! It's fine!

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.029
We can use seawater now.

01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:44.329
We can?

01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:46.800
Shut down reactor No. 1.

01:20:46.939 --> 01:20:48.739
What did you say?

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.170
Who said this?

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.140
Anyone who opposes me
will go to jail.

01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:55.979
This is a direct order from the
president!

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:59.449
If you don't believe me, then confirm
it with your bullshit headquarters!

01:20:59.619 --> 01:21:00.380
Captain.

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:01.519
You heard, right?

01:21:01.619 --> 01:21:02.819
Hurry and connect to seawater.

01:21:02.989 --> 01:21:03.489
Yes.

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:04.680
Let's go! Let's go!

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.520
At once! At once!

01:21:06.689 --> 01:21:09.130
What? Damn it!

01:21:33.119 --> 01:21:34.110
First entry personnel have
arrived and are on standby.

01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:35.449
First entry personnel have
arrived and are on standby.

01:21:35.619 --> 01:21:36.859
Go in as soon as they're ready.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:37.960
I understand.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:43.520
Captain, external hoses have been
connected to the internal system.

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.100
Very good.

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:47.260
Let's flood it inside.

01:21:47.399 --> 01:21:49.560
I understand.

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:16.789
Radiation values are rapidly
declining.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.889
They should be able to start
emergency repairs soon.

01:22:18.989 --> 01:22:20.029
They should be able to start
emergency repairs soon.

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:22.100
At present, the safety of nuclear
reactors can be maintained.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:23.359
Carry on as we are now.

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:25.439
Now we must patch the
storage tank.

01:22:25.569 --> 01:22:27.630
First, we must understand the
conditions on site.

01:22:27.779 --> 01:22:30.439
Please help connect me to
the site operations.

01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:35.939
=Manager, we need to know
the status of the storage tank.=.

01:22:36.079 --> 01:22:37.920
<i>Is something wrong with the
water storage tank?</i>

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:39.279
=I guess you don't know.=

01:22:39.449 --> 01:22:41.319
=The storage tank has
developed a crack.=

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:44.079
=Because the cooling water is being
lost, the cooling rate is decreasing.=.

01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:45.420
<i>What?</i>

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.890
<i>This is more serious than the
situation with the nuclear reactor.</i>

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.050
<i>If the tank explodes, everything
is over.</i>

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:53.260
=lf you want to quickly resolve
this, we need a current status.=.

01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:54.699
<i>I understand.</i>

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:59.829
<i>I can check it quickly.</i>

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.710
<i>The bottom of the water tank has a
crack 10 cm wide and 3 meters long.</i>

01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:47.449
<i>Cooling water is being lost
through that crack.</i>

01:23:47.619 --> 01:23:50.390
<i>The crack must be patched in
order to be watertight.</i>

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.520
<i>The issue is that the cooling
water in the tank is knee deep.</i>

01:23:54.699 --> 01:23:57.560
<i>But people can't tolerate a high concentration
of radiation for more than a few minutes.</i>

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.260
Then how are you going to do it?

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:00.231
We need people to come in who
can work desperately hard.

01:24:00.331 --> 01:24:02.989
We need people to come in
who can work to the end.

01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:06.260
The more, the better.

01:24:16.579 --> 01:24:18.609
Please, get going!

01:24:18.789 --> 01:24:21.720
What's holding us up?

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.619
How can they abandon
their car like that?

01:24:23.789 --> 01:24:25.380
If they abandon their cars,

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.260
the road will be completely
blocked and we can't move!

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.489
No, it will come down here.

01:24:30.659 --> 01:24:32.460
<i>Then that car doesn't matter?</i>

01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:35.100
If this keeps up, we'll be in radiation.
Do you want to die?

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:38.140
Just look.
The wind is blowing this way.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:49.479
=The radiation 100 km from the Hanbyul
power plant is now several times over normal.=

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:54.949
=Radiation has spread
throughout the Daegu area.=.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:56.850
Everyone get off the bus!

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:59.550
Let's go. If we stay here,
we'll all suffer harm!

01:24:59.729 --> 01:25:03.630
<i>Everyone get off.
Cover your body tightly. Let's go.</i>

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.600
Min Jae, let's go.

01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:08.390
Move over. We can go alone.

01:25:08.569 --> 01:25:10.359
Hurry.

01:25:10.539 --> 01:25:14.409
Get off quickly. If you're tired,
you'll have to endure it.

01:25:14.539 --> 01:25:16.309
Min Jae, hold your mom's hand.

01:25:16.409 --> 01:25:18.279
Mom, where are we going?

01:25:18.449 --> 01:25:20.310
Hurry. Hurry. Go this way.

01:25:20.479 --> 01:25:22.109
Walk along that side.

01:25:22.319 --> 01:25:24.149
Don't get separated. Everyone
stay together!

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.720
Hurry.

01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:29.320
Catch up with them.

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:32.220
Hurry! Go quickly!

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.720
Everybody stay together.

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:36.900
Oppa.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.260
=Where are all of you?=.

01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:40.159
What are you doing?
Why do you always call?

01:25:40.329 --> 01:25:42.460
Where are all of you?

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.859
We didn't get very far.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.470
Right now, everyone is walking.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.609
You can't walk far. Why did
you get off the bus?

01:25:48.779 --> 01:25:51.510
What should we do? There's
too much traffic to move.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.100
Everyone is abandoning their
cars and running away.

01:25:55.279 --> 01:25:57.050
I understand.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.449
Just get away.

01:25:59.619 --> 01:26:03.890
Even if you're tired, don't rest
and keep going.

01:26:04.489 --> 01:26:06.319
Get as far away as possible.

01:26:06.489 --> 01:26:08.859
Oppa, you're okay, aren't you?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.930
You'll catch up to us, right?

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:14.159
You just hurry and go.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.960
Don't worry about me and leave.

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.829
I'll call you later.

01:26:23.409 --> 01:26:24.539
<i>Urgent breaking news.</i>

01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:28.079
<i>In order to repair a crack in the water
tank for Hanbyul No. 1 nuclear reactor,</i>

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.909
<i>putting together a repair team
has become a problem.</i>

01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:33.880
<i>The mission was discussed with
the Air Force earlier.</i>

01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:38.030
<i>Forcing a serviceman to perform a certain-death
mission is an infringement of human rights.</i>

01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:40.729
<i>President Gang Seok Ho issued
this order.</i>

01:26:40.829 --> 01:26:43.729
<i>A team of experts is now
looking for other ways.</i>

01:26:43.859 --> 01:26:46.260
<i>President Gang Seok Ho will
soon make a national address.</i>

01:26:46.399 --> 01:26:47.399
<i>Kong Su hyeong!</i>

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:51.159
<i>The President is about to make
an urgent address.</i>

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.569
What is he going to say now?

01:26:54.739 --> 01:26:55.500
What is he saying?

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:56.780
<i>Citizens,</i>

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.010
<i>I have been an incompetent
president.</i>

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:06.520
<i>I feel very sorry and ashamed
to stand in front of all of you.</i>

01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:08.420
<i>The reason I am standing here,</i>

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:12.489
<i>is because I need to ask
something very difficult.</i>

01:27:12.729 --> 01:27:18.319
<i>Hanbyul reactor No. 1 has now
reached an irreversible point.</i>

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.869
<i>The situation that has developed,</i>

01:27:21.039 --> 01:27:23.500
<i>truthfully, the government is
not able to take any steps.</i>

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:27.439
<i>Also, it cannot be mandatory for experts
or the military to solve the problem,</i>

01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:32.510
<i>because no one wants to enter
a land of certain death.</i>

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.939
<i>This would be like committing
suicide.</i>

01:27:34.079 --> 01:27:36.140
<i>I am also unable to issue
that kind of order,</i>

01:27:36.319 --> 01:27:38.909
<i>because that would be like murder.</i>

01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:43.390
<i>That is why I am making this
request of our citizens.</i>

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.549
<i>We now need people to enter
into that place of death.</i>

01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:46.090
<i>We now need people to enter
into that place of death.</i>

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.659
<i>For their families, for their
neighbors.</i>

01:27:48.829 --> 01:27:53.489
<i>Volunteers to carry out repair
work for the sake of this country's future.</i>

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:57.029
<i>In place of an incompetent
government,</i>

01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:58.829
<i>for this country and this nation.</i>

01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:03.640
<i>We are waiting for those who can
save their families and neighbors.</i>

01:28:05.779 --> 01:28:08.300
- <i>I ask this of you.</i>
- What is this bullshit?

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:11.850
A bunch of garbage!

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.880
Where will they find people
without any brains?

01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:16.649
They obviously know it means
death.

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:20.149
This accident was because of
them,

01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:22.229
but the people have to fix it.

01:28:23.029 --> 01:28:24.590
Those sons of bitches.

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:27.390
Assholes.

01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:29.859
Get out of the way.

01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:36.579
Kong Su hyeong.

01:28:36.739 --> 01:28:39.840
Should we go in there?

01:28:40.079 --> 01:28:42.239
What are you saying?

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.579
Aren't we the only ones who can?

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:48.420
Wasn't I a technician working
there?

01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:50.579
Shut up and listen to me.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.560
Going in means you'll die, kid.

01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:56.390
Since you and I have already
been exposed to radiation,

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.000
will we live that much longer
anyway?

01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:01.800
You'd better shut your mouth
before I tear off your lips!

01:29:01.939 --> 01:29:02.900
Excuse me.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.439
We... aren't going to live
very long,

01:29:05.609 --> 01:29:09.270
isn't that right?

01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:13.880
See.

01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:15.310
Everyone...

01:29:15.479 --> 01:29:17.380
let's go in there!

01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:19.680
Do you have a mental problem?

01:29:19.819 --> 01:29:22.149
Why would we go in there?
You must be crazy!

01:29:22.319 --> 01:29:23.619
That's exactly right.

01:29:23.789 --> 01:29:25.850
This kid isn't feeling well.

01:29:27.259 --> 01:29:28.299
Come on.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.060
If nobody goes in,
then everyone is going to die!

01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:33.460
Then who else will go in?

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.680
We're the best ones for it!

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.699
There's no one else but us!

01:29:36.869 --> 01:29:38.930
You idiot.

01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:42.100
<i>Actually, we had imagined this.</i>

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.140
<i>We warned them that it was
very dangerous,</i>

01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:47.909
but they ignored us.

01:29:48.079 --> 01:29:50.449
Now, something has happened.

01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:53.443
From the beginning, they acted
as if nothing had happened

01:29:53.544 --> 01:29:55.079
and tried to deceive everyone.

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.420
Now people are dead.

01:29:57.590 --> 01:30:00.189
Does it make any sense that
the people have to clean it up?

01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:02.060
I agree with you.

01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:07.859
Why should we have to die for
this bullshit country?

01:30:08.039 --> 01:30:11.399
You're crazy. You've lost
your mind.

01:30:11.569 --> 01:30:14.199
Come here, come here.

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:20.640
But, but...

01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:24.479
our families are enough of
a reason.

01:30:24.649 --> 01:30:27.979
They're trying to get far away
to escape the radiation,

01:30:28.119 --> 01:30:30.520
but the roads are jammed.

01:30:30.689 --> 01:30:33.819
The cars aren't even moving.

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.060
They're all now walking on
their feet.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:49.770
If we... If we don't stand up,

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:53.739
our families will also die.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:59.109
Even if it's unfair and it's sad,
there's no other way.

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:02.479
We have to go.

01:31:06.789 --> 01:31:10.289
No one but us will go inside.

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.689
Okay guys,

01:31:11.869 --> 01:31:13.770
let's go inside.

01:31:13.899 --> 01:31:15.130
If none of you will go,

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:17.359
I will go in alone.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.869
Fine. Let's go.

01:31:20.039 --> 01:31:24.010
Let's go inside.

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:29.010
Whether it's fast or slow,
we're all going to die anyway.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.619
If you can still walk, you need
to get up.

01:31:32.789 --> 01:31:33.649
Let's go!

01:31:33.789 --> 01:31:35.409
I'm going, too!

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.649
Let's go.

01:31:36.789 --> 01:31:37.189
<i>I'll go.</i>

01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:38.359
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:41.220
<i>Let's go! Let's do it!</i>

01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:42.189
What did you say?

01:31:42.329 --> 01:31:45.159
We have some volunteers.

01:31:47.029 --> 01:31:49.329
The volunteers... who are they?

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.130
What did you say?

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:53.000
What did you say just now?

01:31:53.170 --> 01:31:54.829
We're going inside.

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:55.979
=Are you crazy?=.

01:31:56.079 --> 01:31:57.739
Why do you have to go in?

01:31:57.909 --> 01:31:59.310
You'll die if you go in!

01:31:59.479 --> 01:32:01.340
=Yeon Ju.=

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.010
I was already exposed to
radiation in the power station.

01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:06.649
I won't live very long anyway.

01:32:06.819 --> 01:32:08.380
Didn't you say you would come?

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.579
Didn't you say you'd catch up
to us?

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.659
I wanted to come,

01:32:13.789 --> 01:32:15.729
but now it's like this.

01:32:15.899 --> 01:32:17.449
Then what am I supposed to do?

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:18.570
What about your mother?

01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:19.720
Sister-in-law?

01:32:19.899 --> 01:32:21.659
And also Min Jae?

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:23.430
That's why I'm going in there.

01:32:23.569 --> 01:32:25.090
To save you...

01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:28.670
Mom, sister-in-law, Min Jae,
to save your lives.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:31.470
What good will it be for me to
live without you?

01:32:31.649 --> 01:32:32.409
I can't.

01:32:32.579 --> 01:32:33.380
I won't let you.

01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:34.479
Don't go in there!

01:32:34.579 --> 01:32:35.549
Don't be like this.

01:32:35.649 --> 01:32:37.119
=You absolutely can't!=.

01:32:37.279 --> 01:32:38.960
If you go in there, I'll break up
with you.

01:32:39.119 --> 01:32:39.880
=Yeon Ju.=.

01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:42.319
Yeon Ju.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.930
Did Jae Hyeok call you?

01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:59.040
Yes.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.470
What did he say? What was it?

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.630
He said he's behind us.

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:07.180
That child, he even ignores his
own family. What is he doing?

01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:10.510
<i>Min Jae, keep your mask on.</i>

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.550
Our Min Jae must be tired.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.810
Should Grandma carry you?

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.420
It's fine. He can walk.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:16.680
He must be tired.

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:17.889
Let me carry him.

01:33:17.989 --> 01:33:19.189
There's no need.

01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:21.220
Come on.

01:33:23.829 --> 01:33:26.029
Let's go.

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:46.979
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:02.060
Hurry! The radiation is coming!

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.189
Run!

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.630
Keep running!

01:34:47.449 --> 01:34:49.380
Hurry!

01:34:49.619 --> 01:34:52.710
Min Jae, hold Mom's hand and
don't let go!

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.619
Min Jae! Min Jae!

01:34:55.789 --> 01:34:56.310
Mother-in-law!

01:34:56.489 --> 01:34:57.890
Min Jae!

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.550
- Min Jae!
- Mother-in-law!

01:35:00.729 --> 01:35:01.449
Sister-in-law!

01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:03.020
Min Jae!

01:35:03.199 --> 01:35:07.189
Min Jae! Min Jae! Min Jae!

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.960
Oh, Min Jae!

01:35:37.199 --> 01:35:39.460
What can I do?

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.100
Min Jae!

01:35:42.239 --> 01:35:46.539
Min Jae! Min Jae!

01:35:46.710 --> 01:35:48.170
Our Min Jae, where are you?

01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:53.340
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:54.880
Min Jae!

01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:55.950
Min Jae!

01:35:56.050 --> 01:36:01.609
Mother!

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.850
Eonni!

01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:07.750
Mother, are you alright?

01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:10.090
Min Jae!

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.930
Min Jae!

01:36:13.829 --> 01:36:18.289
Take care of Min Jae.
Take care of the child.

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:19.840
We have no time.

01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:20.970
We have to hurry.

01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:23.939
Min Jae, I'm sorry.
I couldn't hold onto you.

01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:25.510
Let me see. Let me see.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.439
Are you okay?

01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:28.649
<i>Let me see.</i>

01:36:28.779 --> 01:36:30.439
Grandma!

01:36:31.789 --> 01:36:34.520
Grandma!

01:36:35.319 --> 01:36:37.090
Grandma, are you okay?

01:36:37.289 --> 01:36:40.350
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:50.069
Mother. Mother.

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:55.199
Mother, I'm sorry.

01:36:56.739 --> 01:37:03.550
I'm sorry. It was my fault.
I'm sorry.

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.199
Yeah, it's me.

01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:27.800
Is that really... the only way?

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:31.600
Must it be you and the other
men who go in?

01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:34.369
Who else will go in besides us?

01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:39.449
Then make a promise to me.

01:37:39.619 --> 01:37:41.550
Like what?

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:46.390
No matter what, you'll come
back alive.

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:53.470
Whether it's for a few days
or a few months.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:01.600
After that, I will be able to live
well in a world without you.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.010
Do you understand?

01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:08.310
I understand.

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:12.819
I promise I will definitely
do that.

01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:37.229
Is everyone ready?

01:38:37.409 --> 01:38:38.909
Manager.

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:41.010
We painstakingly saved all of you.

01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:43.649
You're sure you want to do this?

01:38:43.819 --> 01:38:45.909
You all know where this is?

01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:48.039
We wouldn't go if we did.

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.689
I'm sorry, but you must hurry.
There is no more time.

01:38:50.859 --> 01:38:53.050
I'll explain everything on the way.

01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:55.130
Let's get going. What are you
waiting for?

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.760
Let's go. Let's go.

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.689
<i>Hurry, let's go.</i>

01:39:03.199 --> 01:39:05.640
Father.

01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:07.399
What are you doing?

01:39:07.539 --> 01:39:09.270
I'm going, too.

01:39:09.409 --> 01:39:10.670
What?

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.800
Don't say anything else.

01:39:12.979 --> 01:39:17.079
Rather than having to send
you ahead of me,

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.619
we might as well die together.

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:23.710
Along with your mother over
there, our family can be together again.

01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:26.050
You can't!

01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:28.920
Do you know how high the
radiation level was?

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:34.229
I didn't want you to know,
but I'm also showing signs.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.670
Get out of the way.

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:41.640
<i>Father!</i>

01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:45.779
Get some rest. We'll be back
soon.

01:39:45.909 --> 01:39:49.850
Hyeong.

01:40:15.579 --> 01:40:17.670
<i>The place we all need to go,</i>

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.640
is the waste storage room
below the tank.

01:40:20.779 --> 01:40:22.840
Very polluted cooling water
with high radiation

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:24.779
will be as deep as your knees.

01:40:24.949 --> 01:40:29.680
Even wearing protective clothing,
you can't avoid contamination.

01:40:29.859 --> 01:40:33.159
<i>You can stay inside for about
5 to 10 minutes.</i>

01:40:33.329 --> 01:40:34.449
What is this?

01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:35.789
A painkiller.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.090
Take it when you need it.

01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:40.220
Hopefully it will help.

01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:43.770
Manager, your condition
seems better than ours.

01:40:43.899 --> 01:40:46.340
I've already taken a bottle.

01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:49.340
Are you going in with us?

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:52.710
How could the host miss the party?

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:57.840
It's our neighborhood.

01:42:45.489 --> 01:42:46.920
What is the situation now?

01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:48.149
It's not very good.

01:42:48.329 --> 01:42:51.229
The storage tank is rapidly
losing cooling water.

01:42:51.399 --> 01:42:52.689
Because the radiation level is
so high,

01:42:52.829 --> 01:42:55.159
we can't get very close.

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:58.460
We're waiting for the repair
team. The situation is critical.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.760
We must move quickly.

01:42:59.909 --> 01:43:01.100
Let's all get ready.

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:03.670
Be strong.

01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.510
Jae Hyeok,

01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:15.520
it looks like we really are
going to die.

01:43:15.659 --> 01:43:17.680
It's not going to die.

01:43:17.819 --> 01:43:22.060
Let's just say we're going in
so that life can continue.

01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:30.229
Keep walking further away,
further away.

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:35.270
Wait, wait. Put on your masks.
The masks.

01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:36.699
Let me go! Let me go!

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.329
Let go! Just let me go!

01:43:40.909 --> 01:43:43.140
How did this happen?

01:43:43.319 --> 01:43:44.609
<i>How did this happen?</i>

01:43:44.779 --> 01:43:45.550
What's wrong?

01:43:45.689 --> 01:43:46.949
Our neighbors,

01:43:47.119 --> 01:43:50.390
are carrying out the repair
work in the power station.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.460
But they said they won't come
out alive.

01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:53.420
Who is it?

01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:55.029
Who is going in?

01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:57.819
So Jin's father and...

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.359
The ones from the power plant
who were in the hospital...

01:44:00.529 --> 01:44:03.229
All of them have gone inside!

01:44:03.369 --> 01:44:04.869
What about Jae Hyeok?

01:44:05.039 --> 01:44:06.770
What about our Jae Hyeok?

01:44:06.939 --> 01:44:11.930
I'm not sure, but he probably did.

01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:16.369
Jae Hyeok wouldn't go in, right?

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:17.479
That...

01:44:17.579 --> 01:44:20.640
Hurry and tell me! Did Jae
Hyeok go in or not?

01:44:20.819 --> 01:44:22.619
I'm sorry.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.050
What are you telling me?

01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:26.520
You're saying Jae Hyeok has
gone in there?

01:44:26.659 --> 01:44:27.629
Agassi!
[young lady, sister]

01:44:27.729 --> 01:44:29.319
I just couldn't tell you.

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.329
I'm sorry.

01:44:33.029 --> 01:44:34.829
How can this be?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.829
He will come back.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:37.829
He made me a promise.

01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:40.130
He promised that he would
come back alive.

01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:43.899
They said it's not possible to
come out alive!

01:44:44.079 --> 01:44:45.170
Jae Hyeok!

01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:46.309
Jae Hyeok!

01:44:46.409 --> 01:44:47.349
Mother!

01:44:47.449 --> 01:44:48.510
Mother!

01:44:49.119 --> 01:44:53.210
- I have to go find Jae Hyeok!
- Mother! Mother!

01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:54.390
I have to go and find Jae Hyeok!

01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:56.350
- Jae Hyeok!
- Mother.

01:45:10.239 --> 01:45:11.239
It's this way.

01:45:20.409 --> 01:45:21.479
Right here.

01:45:21.579 --> 01:45:23.949
Inside that door is where we
have to work...

01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:28.019
I think you're about to faint
before you even start work.

01:45:28.119 --> 01:45:29.059
Team ♪1,

01:45:29.159 --> 01:45:30.820
go in immediately and confirm
the job path.

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.920
Yes.

01:45:35.029 --> 01:45:36.590
We have to prepare quickly.

01:45:37.159 --> 01:45:38.259
<i>Get ready.</i>

01:45:38.359 --> 01:45:39.700
<i>Assemble the workbench quickly.</i>

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.099
<i>Hurry, hurry!</i>

01:45:41.199 --> 01:45:42.170
<i>Don't waste any time. Get the
equipment installed!</i>

01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:43.170
<i>We can't waste time. Get ready.</i>

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:44.240
<i>Team 1, move!</i>

01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.329
Team 1 has entered into the
job area.

01:45:48.609 --> 01:45:49.139
Manager,

01:45:49.239 --> 01:45:51.800
I know it's very difficult, but
go as fast as possible.

01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:56.650
<i>According to reports, repairs have just
started on the crack in the water tank.</i>

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:59.019
<i>Due to the high concentration
of radiation,</i>

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:01.049
<i>it will be difficult to survive.</i>

01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:03.089
<i>The outsourced employees of
the power station,</i>

01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:05.089
<i>as well as a firefighting rescue
team,</i>

01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:09.130
<i>have formed a group of 25 people who
are in a life and death struggle.</i>

01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:12.420
I made it.

01:46:13.699 --> 01:46:14.769
I'm out.

01:46:14.869 --> 01:46:16.339
Go and give them some help.

01:46:16.439 --> 01:46:17.101
Yes.

01:46:17.201 --> 01:46:19.210
Hurry, help them quickly.

01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:21.399
Are you okay? Hang in there.

01:46:23.609 --> 01:46:24.780
Come here, come here.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.979
All of you have worked hard.

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:27.710
Let's get out. Let's get out.

01:46:27.810 --> 01:46:28.549
You've all worked hard.

01:46:28.649 --> 01:46:30.239
Hurry, grab the equipment.

01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.389
Team 2, start the waterproofing
job.

01:46:34.489 --> 01:46:36.250
Yes. Everyone be careful.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.370
That radiation is really high.

01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:48.270
They've already started the
waterproofing job.

01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:13.490
Just hold on a little longer.

01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:15.119
It's almost time.

01:47:22.130 --> 01:47:23.130
Are you okay?

01:47:23.369 --> 01:47:24.769
Time is up. Team 2, come out.

01:47:24.869 --> 01:47:25.769
Team 3, go in.

01:47:25.869 --> 01:47:26.969
Don't waste any time.

01:47:27.069 --> 01:47:28.439
There's not much time.

01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:35.670
Are you okay?

01:47:40.119 --> 01:47:41.189
<i>You've worked hard.</i>

01:47:41.289 --> 01:47:42.649
<i>You've all worked hard.</i>

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.089
Team 3, begin the waterproofing
job.

01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:48.229
What is the condition of the
repair teams that came out?

01:47:48.329 --> 01:47:50.030
Not very good.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:53.229
There's nothing for them except
going to the hospital for pain medication.

01:47:53.329 --> 01:47:55.390
If it will help their pain, that's good.

01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.469
Manager,

01:47:59.569 --> 01:48:02.280
how is the repair progressing?

01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:04.540
<i>So far, it's going smoothly.</i>

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.250
<i>I'm not sure if the progress
deserves to be called smooth,</i>

01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:09.550
but in any case, it's presently
going according to plan.

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:13.909
What happened?

01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:20.760
Hurry, help them!

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.600
How are you?

01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:28.729
Are you okay?

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.969
Bring them out quickly!

01:48:34.069 --> 01:48:35.100
Let's go out.

01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:42.310
Get out quickly!

01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:48.920
The situation is very bad.

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.689
The crack has gotten bigger.

01:48:50.789 --> 01:48:53.460
A great amount of cooling water
is flowing out.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.389
I'm sorry.

01:48:55.489 --> 01:48:57.989
The repair work will be
impossible to continue.

01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:01.659
It's too late.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.939
It's too late.

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:14.110
=We just received the grim news that
the repair operation has failed.=

01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:17.679
=Because the internal crack
has suddenly increased, =

01:49:17.779 --> 01:49:20.290
=the repair work cannot
presently be continued.=

01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:22.660
=The repair work has been
suspended.=

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.689
=lt is confirmed that they are
preparing to withdraw.=

01:49:25.789 --> 01:49:28.889
=The fantasy of hope they had
given us all has also vanished.=

01:49:28.989 --> 01:49:31.470
=The fantasy of hope they had
given us all has also vanished.=.

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.610
Everyone leave.

01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:48.479
Leave and go back to your
families.

01:49:48.579 --> 01:49:49.739
Hurry.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.689
Why are you still here?

01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:56.789
Let's go.

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:59.290
Didn't he say there's nothing
we can do?

01:49:59.390 --> 01:50:00.860
Get up quickly.

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:02.590
Get up. Let's go.

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.500
We've done all that we could.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:05.629
Let's go.

01:50:05.729 --> 01:50:06.370
Let's go.

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.969
Come on, let's go.

01:50:07.069 --> 01:50:07.799
Let's go, okay?

01:50:07.899 --> 01:50:09.189
Just a second!

01:50:15.810 --> 01:50:18.569
Can't we just seal that entrance?

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:20.750
What do you mean?

01:50:20.850 --> 01:50:23.479
We just need to think of a way
to seal that entrance.

01:50:23.579 --> 01:50:26.389
Then if we collapse the ceiling,

01:50:26.489 --> 01:50:30.579
that room... won't it be full of
water?

01:50:32.159 --> 01:50:33.290
That's right!

01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:34.290
<i>Exactly.</i>

01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:35.720
<i>What Jae Hyeok said is right.</i>

01:50:39.029 --> 01:50:40.700
What did you just say?

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.500
<i>The entrance to the room will
be sealed, forming a reservoir.</i>

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:44.639
<i>If the ceiling...</i>

01:50:44.739 --> 01:50:47.240
that is directly below the
storage tank collapses,

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:50.540
<i>won't the spent nuclear fuel
rods be immersed in a pool of water?</i>

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:51.710
That's right.

01:50:51.810 --> 01:50:54.110
We will blow up the ceiling
below the tank.

01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:55.679
Is this feasible?

01:50:55.779 --> 01:50:56.820
We will have to try.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.349
But...

01:50:57.449 --> 01:50:58.420
But, what?

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.189
The crack is widening quickly.

01:51:00.289 --> 01:51:04.160
I don't think we can wait to set the
explosives until the doorway is sealed.

01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:06.229
We will have to do it at the
same time.

01:51:06.329 --> 01:51:09.429
Doesn't that mean someone
won't be able to come out?

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:10.890
That's right.

01:51:15.569 --> 01:51:17.299
Who will go in?

01:51:17.399 --> 01:51:19.870
The person who can set the
explosives...

01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:21.699
there is only one.

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.729
Jae Hyeok.

01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:47.920
I'll do it.

01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:49.769
We're talking about explosives.

01:51:49.869 --> 01:51:51.949
I've seen you too scared to
even touch a firecracker.

01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:54.000
Forget it, kid.

01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.910
I shouldn't have been so lazy
when I was in the Army,

01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:00.909
and should have studied more.

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:03.310
I'm sorry.

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:05.649
<i>The explosives have arrived!</i>

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.890
<i>Get ready quickly.</i>

01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:15.220
What are they doing?

01:52:15.689 --> 01:52:17.359
Didn't they say there's not
much time?

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:21.260
Come on. We can't waste
any time.

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.739
<i>Focus and don't dawdle.</i>

01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:26.300
Okay!

01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:29.210
Come quickly.

01:52:30.439 --> 01:52:31.500
Come on.

01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:34.580
Come on, be strong.

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.180
Hurry. Hurry.

01:52:37.949 --> 01:52:39.420
The workbench is ready.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.520
Good job.

01:52:47.729 --> 01:52:49.020
Everyone has suffered.

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:52.090
Thank you.

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:05.880
Jae Hyeok.

01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:08.750
Kid.

01:53:19.659 --> 01:53:22.250
We'll all meet in Heaven, right?

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.199
I'm just going first.

01:53:34.739 --> 01:53:36.569
The rest of you, take your time.

01:53:41.579 --> 01:53:43.049
Jae Hyeok!

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.650
Jae Hyeok.

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:44.840
Jae Hyeok!

01:53:48.619 --> 01:53:49.750
Jae Hyeok.

01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.420
The door...

01:53:55.229 --> 01:53:56.960
must be closed.

01:54:02.529 --> 01:54:03.590
<i>Jae Hyeok!</i>

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:13.140
We will start our work.

01:54:28.029 --> 01:54:29.160
Jae Hyeok.

01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:30.819
I'm sorry, Jae Hyeok.

01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:15.859
Father!

01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:19.280
Father, let me.

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:20.979
I said I'll do it!

01:55:21.079 --> 01:55:22.479
I'll do it.

01:55:22.579 --> 01:55:24.250
Pay close attention to time!

01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:25.580
Are you okay?

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:28.549
<i>I've used all the explosives.</i>

01:55:28.649 --> 01:55:33.860
I don't think... I can hold on
much longer.

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.599
Can I just detonate them now?

01:55:37.699 --> 01:55:38.599
No.

01:55:38.699 --> 01:55:40.000
Wait a little longer.

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:41.960
We're almost done. Hold on.

01:55:42.329 --> 01:55:44.939
But my body won't listen to
orders.

01:55:45.039 --> 01:55:48.570
They won't let me see Jae Hyeok,
or hear his voice!

01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:51.080
This is just so outrageous!

01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:52.110
Mother!

01:55:52.210 --> 01:55:53.250
Jae Hyeok!

01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:54.780
Oppa will come soon!

01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.820
He said he'd come back fine,
Mother!

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.250
Jae Hyeok!

01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:24.470
Manager.

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:26.549
Yes.

01:56:26.649 --> 01:56:27.780
Go ahead.

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.939
=Please do something for me.=.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.979
What?

01:56:32.079 --> 01:56:33.310
What did you say?

01:56:34.489 --> 01:56:36.490
Oppa is on television!

01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:38.019
- Jae Hyeok!
- Mother!

01:56:38.119 --> 01:56:40.429
- Jae Hyeok!
- Don't be like this.

01:56:40.529 --> 01:56:41.490
Mother.

01:56:41.590 --> 01:56:43.530
I heard Oppa will be on TV.

01:56:43.630 --> 01:56:44.900
What did you say?

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.989
I said Oppa will be on TV!

01:56:49.199 --> 01:56:49.759
Mother, follow me.

01:56:49.859 --> 01:56:50.769
Mother, follow me.

01:56:50.869 --> 01:56:52.170
You too, Eonni.

01:56:53.369 --> 01:56:55.240
- Jae Hyeok!
- Mother!

01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.270
Jae Hyeok!

01:56:58.239 --> 01:56:59.710
Hurry this way!

01:56:59.810 --> 01:57:01.800
Our Jae Hyeok will be on TV.

01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:03.670
Get on.

01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:11.821
Manager,

01:57:11.921 --> 01:57:13.409
everything is ready here.

01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.359
We're ready.

01:57:20.529 --> 01:57:22.159
My family...

01:57:26.039 --> 01:57:27.969
are they watching me?

01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:31.510
=Yes, they're watching.=.

01:57:32.850 --> 01:57:34.609
Thank you.

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.880
Mom.

01:57:43.119 --> 01:57:44.460
It's me.

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.680
Jae Hyeok!

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:48.189
Jae Hyeok.

01:57:48.289 --> 01:57:52.789
Even if I can't see you, you can
see me clearly, right?

01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:56.070
I can see you.

01:57:56.170 --> 01:57:58.070
I can see you clearly.

01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:00.839
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

01:58:00.939 --> 01:58:04.080
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:07.170
I'm sorry, but I have to leave first.

01:58:09.479 --> 01:58:12.810
I'm sorry I have to say goodbye
this way.

01:58:14.289 --> 01:58:16.750
I'm sorry for everything.

01:58:18.659 --> 01:58:20.389
Don't be sad.

01:58:20.489 --> 01:58:23.030
I'm going first,

01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:27.000
but I'll take good care of
Father and my brother.

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:28.269
Jae Hyeok.

01:58:28.369 --> 01:58:30.770
<i>You should live a long, long life.</i>

01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:34.070
Let Min Jae get married,

01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:37.399
and hold your great-grandchild.

01:58:40.609 --> 01:58:45.820
You have to keep living for a
very long time.

01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:47.320
Do you understand?

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:49.089
I can't.

01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:51.050
I can't, Jae Hyeok.

01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:54.220
Then there's my sister-in-law.

01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:57.520
My brother isn't around.

01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.430
If you will take good care of my
mother, I would be grateful.

01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:06.939
These are the words that had
been in my heart to tell you,

01:59:07.909 --> 01:59:10.880
but I felt too awkward to be
able to say it.

01:59:12.439 --> 01:59:14.239
Thank you.

01:59:15.479 --> 01:59:18.320
I'm very grateful.

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:20.850
Bring up Min Jae well.

01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.119
I will.

01:59:25.659 --> 01:59:26.960
Mom!

01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:28.759
Where is my uncle going?

01:59:28.859 --> 01:59:31.119
Where is my uncle going?

01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.399
Yeon Ju.

01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:48.110
You must be angry.

01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:50.939
You must hate me for not
keeping my promise.

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:54.550
Don't be like that.

01:59:55.989 --> 01:59:57.719
I also...

01:59:57.819 --> 02:00:00.760
wanted to live with you more
than one day,

02:00:02.659 --> 02:00:05.859
eating the food that you made
with your own hands.

02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:09.989
<i>Someday, I wanted to fall
asleep inside your arms.</i>

02:00:10.739 --> 02:00:13.640
But it's not something I can
have because I want it.

02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:21.110
I won't be able to keep my
promise to make you happy.

02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:24.880
I can't keep my promise to
stay with you forever.

02:00:27.590 --> 02:00:30.890
I sincerely... wanted to treat
you well.

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.020
I sincerely...

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.289
wanted to have a happy life
with you.

02:00:47.010 --> 02:00:48.270
Why?

02:00:48.939 --> 02:00:51.880
Why can't it be?

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:59.140
I'm not asking for much.

02:01:01.789 --> 02:01:05.590
Why do I have to die like this?
Why?

02:01:06.359 --> 02:01:08.449
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:12.220
Just what have I done wrong?

02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:17.060
I didn't want to die like this.

02:01:23.010 --> 02:01:25.000
I'm really...

02:01:26.649 --> 02:01:29.439
I'm really afraid.

02:01:30.649 --> 02:01:32.840
Mom.

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.479
Mom.

02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:40.550
Mom, I'm scared.

02:01:41.029 --> 02:01:42.089
What can I do?

02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:43.530
What can I do?

02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:46.260
My Jae Hyeok is so pitiful.
What can I do?

02:01:48.130 --> 02:01:49.229
What can I do?

02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:51.340
What can I do?

02:02:29.369 --> 02:02:31.810
I never wanted it to be like this.

02:02:32.579 --> 02:02:35.050
I'm such a loser. What's wrong
with me?

02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:43.689
Just don't forget me.
Remember me.

02:02:45.159 --> 02:02:50.259
That way, at least I won't
regret dying like this.

02:02:50.359 --> 02:02:54.390
Kang Jae Hyeok was not a coward.

02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:57.829
All of you remember that.

02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:06.979
Be sure you do.

02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:11.150
Jae Hyeok!

02:03:11.250 --> 02:03:12.219
Jae Hyeok!

02:03:12.319 --> 02:03:13.319
Jae Hyeok!

02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:14.850
Jae Hyeok!

02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.050
Jae Hyeok!

02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:19.350
Jae Hyeok!

02:03:20.590 --> 02:03:21.689
<i>Jae Hyeok!</i>

02:03:21.789 --> 02:03:23.330
Aigoo, my child!

02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:26.030
My poor child! What can I do?

02:03:26.130 --> 02:03:27.220
Jae Hyeok.

02:03:27.329 --> 02:03:30.769
Jae Hyeok.

02:03:30.869 --> 02:03:34.370
- Jae Hyeok.
- Mother.

02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:35.500
<i>Mother.</i>

02:03:36.710 --> 02:03:38.899
How much longer?

02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:42.500
It's okay. We're finished here.

02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:45.640
Everyone can go out.

02:03:47.289 --> 02:03:49.310
Hurry and get out.

02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:51.619
I'm sorry.

02:03:52.319 --> 02:03:53.021
Get out!

02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:54.990
Leave quickly!

02:03:55.090 --> 02:03:56.149
Get going!

02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:58.259
Hurry!

02:03:58.359 --> 02:03:59.359
Leave!

02:04:03.439 --> 02:04:04.770
Hurry, go out!

02:04:14.579 --> 02:04:16.420
Hurry, go! Quickly!

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.520
Go out!

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:18.820
Get out!

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:19.651
Hurry!

02:04:19.751 --> 02:04:22.310
Hurry, go out!

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:25.321
What?

02:04:25.421 --> 02:04:26.649
Jae Hyeok!

02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:28.680
Jae Hyeok!

02:04:52.949 --> 02:04:54.250
Jae Hyeok,

02:04:57.989 --> 02:05:00.920
life can really suck.

02:05:59.619 --> 02:06:02.889
=The spent nuclear fuel rods
are submerged in the reservoir.=

02:06:02.989 --> 02:06:04.360
=I repeat.=

02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:07.629
=The spent nuclear fuel rods
are submerged in the reservoir.=

02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:10.330
=As long as the reservoir
remains full of cooling water, =

02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:12.590
=the nuclear power plant has
been sealed very safely.=.

02:06:18.539 --> 02:06:20.729
What happened to that person?

02:06:22.439 --> 02:06:24.100
=He couldn't come out.=.

02:06:27.850 --> 02:06:29.140
Mr. President.

02:06:30.279 --> 02:06:32.519
He wasn't called "that person."

02:06:32.619 --> 02:06:35.020
He was Kang Jae Hyeok.

02:06:41.329 --> 02:06:43.159
Kang Jae Hyeok.

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:45.359
I will remember.

02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:49.430
I will certainly remember.

02:07:13.729 --> 02:07:16.900
<i>Oppa, why do you hate
the power station?</i>

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.759
<i>I don't hate it.</i>

02:07:18.859 --> 02:07:20.330
<i>I'm afraid of it.</i>

02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:22.099
<i>What are you so afraid of?</i>

02:07:22.199 --> 02:07:24.540
<i>There was a leak at the nuclear
power plant,</i>

02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.500
<i>but nobody was worried,</i>

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:28.229
<i>and they didn't seem to care.</i>

02:07:29.210 --> 02:07:32.039
<i>The attitude of indifference
was really scary.</i>

02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:34.609
<i>We can't be like that.</i>

02:07:35.779 --> 02:07:37.750
<i>Not only just us,</i>

02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:40.049
<i>but even children like Min Jae.</i>

02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:42.549
<i>They can't be like that, either.</i>

02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:45.460
<i>Do you want to pass down to
our children</i>

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:49.360
<i>a world with good food
and a good life,</i>

02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:50.830
<i>Or...</i>

02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:53.960
<i>do you want to leave them a
safe and comfortable world?</i>

02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:57.839
<i>Don't close your eyes because
of fear.</i>

02:07:57.939 --> 02:08:01.170
<i>Don't cover your ears because
of fear.</i>

02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:05.810
<i>We have opened Pandora's Box.</i>

02:08:06.409 --> 02:08:08.750
<i>Although disaster and evil
were inside,</i>

02:08:08.850 --> 02:08:11.479
<i>wasn't there also Hope?</i>

02:08:11.579 --> 02:08:14.779
<i>Among all that, we must find Hope,</i>

02:08:16.119 --> 02:08:18.079
<i>for the sake of our children.</i>
