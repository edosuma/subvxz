WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:05.037
(footsteps approach)

00:05.039 --> 00:06.605
You, uh, got a minute, boss?

00:06.607 --> 00:08.073
Actually, I'm kind of busy.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.976
I'm pushing new code on an api
for this e-comm platform.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.511
"I am from the future.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.980
I am a handsome robot."

00:14.982 --> 00:16.615
Look, I-I wouldn't
bother you with this

00:16.617 --> 00:17.783
If I didn't think
it was important.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.218
Okay. Just make it quick.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.419
That's my specialty.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.854
Ask any woman
I've ever been with.

00:23.923 --> 00:25.524
I will call them both.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.760
What do you got?

00:27.762 --> 00:30.829
Behold your new

00:30.831 --> 00:32.131
Coffee mug.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.333
(imitates crowd cheering)

00:34.335 --> 00:36.268
What?

00:36.270 --> 00:38.270
Remember? You asked me to look
for new mugs for your office.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.271
What do you think?

00:39.273 --> 00:41.073
Well, there's a hole on the top

00:41.075 --> 00:42.241
And no hole on the bottom.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.342
Nailed it.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.510
Thanks.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.611
Uh, so, uh, what do you want
written on it?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.179
Written on it?

00:47.181 --> 00:48.380
Uh, your choices are

00:48.382 --> 00:49.948
"coffee," "java" or "joe."

00:49.950 --> 00:51.984
I don't know. Just...
Joe.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.218
Excellent choice.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.754
Although... What if
you hire a guy named joe?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.589
I-I think the temptation
for these mugs

00:57.591 --> 00:59.691
To walk out the door
is a little too high.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.660
Fine.
Just write "coffee" on it.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.262
Great!
Uh, coffee in the mug,

01:03.264 --> 01:05.330
And coffee on the mug.
Love it!

01:05.332 --> 01:06.398
Oh, uh...

01:06.400 --> 01:07.699
But, uh, let me run
this past you:

01:07.701 --> 01:10.035
"java the mug."

01:11.504 --> 01:13.839
You know, because of <i>star wars.</i>

01:13.841 --> 01:14.740
Stop!

01:14.742 --> 01:16.008
Right.
Right.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.543
You're busy.
(laughs)

01:17.545 --> 01:18.777
Oh! Uh, one
last thing.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.512
Oh, good god!
Alan,

01:20.514 --> 01:21.847
I hired you as my assistant

01:21.849 --> 01:23.682
So I don't have to think
about things like this.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.683
Oh, yeah, I know,

01:24.685 --> 01:26.118
But I want to do
a good job for you.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.586
I mean, you're gonna look
at this every day

01:27.588 --> 01:28.754
And I don't want you
to hate it.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.155
That does happen with things

01:30.157 --> 01:31.790
I look at every day.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.992
Okay, so one
final question:

01:33.994 --> 01:36.728
Do you want your mug to be
left-handed or right-handed?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.800
You're kidding, right?

01:41.802 --> 01:43.735
No, some people hold 'em
in their left hand,

01:43.737 --> 01:46.105
Some people hold 'em
in their right hand.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.541
Mm-hmm.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.747
(dramatic gasp)
wow.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.416
Okay. Okay.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.651
Changing your mug
from "world's greatest boss"

01:59.653 --> 02:01.520
To "world's smartest boss."
okay.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.988
I'm gonna go pee.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.857
Oh, oh, as long as you're
in the bathroom, uh,

02:04.859 --> 02:07.793
I left three different types of
toilet tissue in there for you.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.195
Uh, let me know
which one is best.

02:10.197 --> 02:14.199
Oh! And the brown one
is not a joke.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.034
"hire me, walden.
I can be your assistant."

02:16.036 --> 02:19.104
You know what your mug should
say? "world's worst employee."

02:21.975 --> 02:25.077
Oh, world's second
worst employee.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.955
Hey, nap time's over.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.223
I'm not napping.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.925
I threw my back out.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.660
My god, are you okay?
What happened?

02:41.662 --> 02:45.797
It seized up when I was climbing
into your bed to take a nap.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.400
Okay, uh,
everything's gonna be okay.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.568
Just... Relax.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.069
Alan, get up here!

02:51.071 --> 02:52.471
Why are you calling zippy?

02:52.473 --> 02:54.072
He's a chiropractor--
he can help.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.407
(laughs)
oh, stop.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.210
It hurts when I laugh.
(chuckles) oh.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.212
Has this happened before?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.548
Once. At a bike rally
in sturgis.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.484
Me and a couple of hells angels
decided to drop acid

03:05.486 --> 03:07.085
And get naked.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.855
Alan!

03:09.857 --> 03:11.190
What's going on?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.524
Is something wrong?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.859
Berta threw her back out.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.661
Oh, no. What should we do?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.196
Well, I called
a chiropractor.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.630
Great.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.700
Oh, me! Oh...

03:21.702 --> 03:22.868
Duh.
(chuckles)

03:22.870 --> 03:24.536
Well, uh, let's see
what we got here.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.671
Where's the pain?

03:25.673 --> 03:28.607
Standing in front of me
asking stupid questions.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.742
Berta, be nice.
Alan's a doctor.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.844
(laughing):
Oh. Oh.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.179
Yes, yes, ha-ha.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.681
But I can help you.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.749
Although I am legally
obligated to tell you

03:37.751 --> 03:39.084
My license has expired.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.019
But thankfully backs
haven't changed that much

03:41.021 --> 03:43.355
Since my unsuccessful
board review.
(chuckles)

03:43.357 --> 03:45.290
So, uh, you can't
move at all?

03:45.292 --> 03:47.259
Every time I do,
it tightens up more.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.794
Oh, sounds
like a classic back spasm.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.862
You probably just need
bed rest and ice, uh,

03:50.864 --> 03:53.365
But, just in case, let me see
if you need a spinal adjustment.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.300
Touch me and you die.

03:55.302 --> 03:58.971
(quietly):
She may also need
an attitude adjustment.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.840
Okay, I'll call my doctor and
have him come take a look.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.509
(scoffs)
western medicine. He'll probably
just prescribe pain killers.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.877
Call him.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.146
I will. In
the meantime,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.514
You stay here as
long as you need.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.816
I'll take the guest room.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.019
Why? My back's out
but my front still works.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.623
Be like sturgis all over again.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.691
(chuckles)
oh...

04:21.594 --> 04:22.928
Morning.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.529
Hey.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.798
Hey, were you alone last night?

04:26.800 --> 04:27.833
Yeah, why?

04:27.835 --> 04:31.169
Because from 11:15 to 11:22,

04:31.171 --> 04:33.238
All I heard was, "oh, yeah,

04:33.240 --> 04:36.041
That's the way daddy likes it."

04:37.010 --> 04:41.079
Oh, um...

04:41.081 --> 04:44.082
Uh, right, the-the walls
are really thin,

04:44.084 --> 04:46.051
Uh, between my bedroom
and the guest room,

04:46.053 --> 04:48.487
And I-I was watching tv.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.821
Hmm.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.758
So the same show
came on again at 1:30

04:52.760 --> 04:54.726
And then again at 4:15?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.595
Huh.
(scoffs)

04:56.597 --> 04:58.964
Weird.
(chuckles)

04:58.966 --> 05:00.565
Can I ask you something?

05:00.567 --> 05:01.566
Mm-hmm.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.403
What is wrong with daddy?

05:04.405 --> 05:07.072
He's lonely, okay?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.241
Can you just let it go?

05:09.243 --> 05:11.176
I should ask you
the same question.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.813
What are you doing?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.481
Well, since berta
is incapacitated,

05:16.483 --> 05:19.685
I have taken the initiative to
design and build a chore wheel.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.019
What is a chore wheel?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.689
It is a wheel with a variety
of chores on the outside

05:23.691 --> 05:25.290
And names on the inside.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.792
I got the idea
from my brother charlie,

05:26.794 --> 05:28.460
Who had a whore wheel.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.864
The only name on it is "walden."

05:32.866 --> 05:36.601
Ah, that's because it was my
chore to make the chore wheel.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.270
And your
first chore

05:38.272 --> 05:39.771
Is...

05:39.773 --> 05:41.239
"cleaning alan's room."

05:41.241 --> 05:42.641
(sucks air through teeth)
ooh.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.744
That's gonna be tough
after last night.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.381
Maybe you should
have daddy do it.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.721
Whoa, somebody found my stash.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.056
Wasn't hard.
It was right here in this box

05:58.058 --> 06:01.193
That says "not pot."
(chuckles)

06:01.195 --> 06:02.928
Very clever.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.730
I didn't want anybody
to find my pot.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.231
I was about to write, uh,

06:06.233 --> 06:09.401
"this box contains
poisonous jumping bugs,"

06:09.403 --> 06:11.603
But then I thought,
"what if this magic marker

06:11.605 --> 06:13.438
"is actually magic
and it turns my pot

06:13.440 --> 06:15.941
Into poisonous jumping bugs?"

06:15.943 --> 06:17.709
(chuckles)

06:17.711 --> 06:19.311
I was really high.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.513
Uh, you know, I-I really
don't think it's a good idea

06:21.515 --> 06:23.782
To mix marijuana
with muscle relaxers.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.450
Oh, those pills are long gone.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.586
What? You had a good
two weeks' worth.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.921
Or a great one night's worth.
(chuckles)

06:29.923 --> 06:31.990
Oh, bacon.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.559
You guys take
such good care of me.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.261
That's because
you take good care of us.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.097
That's because I love you guys.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.133
I love you more. Shh!

06:41.135 --> 06:42.968
How's your back feeling?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.703
Actually, a lot better.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.938
I think I'm ready
to go back to work.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.340
Oh, really?
So you can get up?

06:48.342 --> 06:50.342
Absolutely.
(chuckles)

06:50.344 --> 06:52.344
Am I up?

06:52.346 --> 06:53.345
No.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.147
Damn.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.815
How 'bout now?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.018
Yep, looking good.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.820
Told you.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.890
Hey! Bacon!

07:09.162 --> 07:11.797
Why do these have windows?

07:14.367 --> 07:15.567
I don't need to see inside.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.503
I trust 'em to wash
and dry the clothes.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.038
You know,
when you think about it,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.307
A lot of appliances
have windows.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.575
Ovens,

07:23.577 --> 07:25.210
Microwaves.

07:26.779 --> 07:30.382
Wait a minute. Are we watching
them or are they watching us?

07:30.384 --> 07:33.285
Got a little contact high
in there with berta,

07:33.287 --> 07:35.387
Did you?
Shh!

07:35.389 --> 07:37.122
(whispers):
Not in front of the washer.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.394
Hey, how old do you think
berta is anyway?

07:42.396 --> 07:45.397
I don't even know
her last name.

07:45.399 --> 07:49.267
You know, I'm just thinkin',
I mean, she hurt her back.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.102
It's taking her
a while to recover.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.072
I mean, maybe this job's just
getting to be too much for her.

07:54.074 --> 07:54.940
Really?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.107
Yeah, I don't know.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.375
I mean, she's not getting
any younger,

07:57.377 --> 07:59.444
And it's a pretty
labor-intensive job.

07:59.446 --> 08:03.648
Why in the world do you wear
boys' husky underwear?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.152
Okay, you know how some
people trim the hedges

08:07.154 --> 08:08.687
To make the
tree look bigger?

08:15.027 --> 08:19.998
Well, I say stuff the tree
in a smaller yard.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.168
Well, when the police
raid the house

08:23.170 --> 08:25.036
And find a drawer full
of boys' underwear,

08:25.038 --> 08:27.038
That's not gonna be good
for any of us.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.874
Neither is a drawer full of pot.

08:28.876 --> 08:33.011
That's why I wrote
"not pot" on it.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.847
So are you saying you think
it's time for berta to retire?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.183
I don't know.
Everyone slows down eventually.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.452
Mmm, maybe you're right.

08:40.454 --> 08:43.622
Maybe it's time to put
the old girl out to pasture.

08:43.624 --> 08:47.325
Send her off
to the housekeeper farm upstate.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.928
That might not be the best way
to tell her.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.264
What? The-the farm
is a beautiful place.

08:52.266 --> 08:56.001
She can run out in the fields
with all the other housekeepers.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.603
There's sponges
and fabric softener

08:58.605 --> 09:01.139
As far as the eye can see.

09:01.141 --> 09:05.076
And the only dishes left in
the sink are made of chocolate.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.446
I may be a little
stoned, too.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.716
You ever hear
about the roommate farm?

09:14.921 --> 09:15.720
Berta.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.756
We got a little surprise
for you.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.357
Chuck norris?

09:20.326 --> 09:23.662
Fried chicken,
cheesecake and beer.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.499
That's what my first husband
requested for his last meal.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.301
Am I dying?

09:29.303 --> 09:30.569
Oh, don't be silly.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.137
Do you like farms?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.438
What?
Walden:
Oh.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.708
I-I think what he's trying
to say is,

09:36.710 --> 09:40.912
Have you ever thought about
hanging up the old toilet brush?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.282
Raising that vest up
to the rafters?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.952
Oh, my god, you're firing me.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.020
(chuckles)
no. I-I would
never fire you.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.522
I'm talking about retirement.

09:50.524 --> 09:51.590
Just kicking back,

09:51.592 --> 09:53.692
Taking it easy,
getting high every day.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.393
I do that now.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.264
Besides, I can't afford
to retire.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.333
Well, what about that
pension plan I set up for you?

10:01.335 --> 10:03.335
I'll tell you
what happened to it: Life.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.003
Your house needs a new roof,

10:05.005 --> 10:06.671
Your grandson needs braces,

10:06.673 --> 10:09.708
Your daughter's meth lab
explodes.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.042
What were you planning
on doing,

10:11.044 --> 10:12.477
Working for the rest
of your life?

10:12.479 --> 10:15.981
Nah, I thought about, uh,
getting a villa in tuscany.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.717
Then I said, "nah,
I'll just hang around here

10:18.719 --> 10:21.820
And clean the skid marks
out of zippy's underwear."

10:25.291 --> 10:26.958
How about this?

10:26.960 --> 10:30.895
What if you could make
the same money you're making now

10:30.897 --> 10:32.964
And never have to work again?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.733
One last job? I like it.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.501
Am I driving or shooting?

10:36.503 --> 10:39.037
No. You retire,

10:39.039 --> 10:41.573
And I'll pay you for
the rest of your life.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.675
You're gonna pay me
for doing nothing?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.343
Yeah. I call it
the alan harper plan.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.014
Where's this coming from?

10:49.016 --> 10:52.183
Uh, we're-we're just...
Worried about you.
Um...

10:52.185 --> 10:55.153
This is a tough job, especially
for a woman of your age.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.921
What?

10:56.923 --> 10:59.491
He said it's hard
for a woman your age
to do this job.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.425
I heard him!

11:00.427 --> 11:01.726
Oh.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.662
I can do the job just fine.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.897
Really? Because you
basically bent over

11:05.899 --> 11:08.633
And haven't been able to get
out of bed for two days.

11:08.635 --> 11:12.070
So you just want to treat me
like some pathetic charity case

11:12.072 --> 11:13.672
You can throw money at.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.107
Oh, no-no one's saying
you're a charity case.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.542
Although, I, on the other hand,

11:17.544 --> 11:19.844
Would be happy to be one
of walden's kids.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.949
I'm just trying to do
something nice for you.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.751
By giving me a handout?

11:26.753 --> 11:29.521
Unlike you, I've worked for
every cent I ever made.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.288
Excuse me?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.923
You got rich from one idea.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.459
You have no clue what it's like
to work for a living.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.095
Okay, I am not gonna apologize
for being successful.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.430
No, you are not,
my friend.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.998
Shut up!
Shut up!

11:40.000 --> 11:41.499
Work for a living?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.768
You hurt your back trying
to take a nap!

11:43.770 --> 11:45.103
You know what?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.871
I don't have to take this crap.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.206
Well, that makes two of us.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.774
It's settled then. I quit.

11:49.776 --> 11:52.544
Oh, no! Where am I gonna find
someone to eat my food,

11:52.546 --> 11:55.680
Smoke my pot
and sleep in my bed?!

11:55.682 --> 11:56.715
Oh...

11:56.717 --> 11:58.616
Shut up!

12:05.157 --> 12:07.959
(sighs)
so what do you think?
Was I right, or what?

12:07.961 --> 12:10.095
Yes, helen is great.
Mm.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.596
Although I still
don't understand

12:11.598 --> 12:14.099
Why we couldn't at least
<i>interview</i> a topless maid.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.401
Or four.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.203
Will you forget
about the topless maids?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.004
I will never forget
about the topless maids.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.339
You saw the video.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.676
"the only thing dirty
in your house will be me."

12:24.678 --> 12:26.644
(door opening)

12:26.646 --> 12:27.812
Supper time, boys.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.013
Oh.
Oh.

12:29.015 --> 12:32.183
Helen, this lemonade
is delicious.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.686
That's because
I have a secret ingredient.

12:34.688 --> 12:35.920
Oh, really?
What-what is it?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.088
Love.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.190
Aw!
Oh!

12:39.192 --> 12:41.059
And, like, a pound of sugar.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.827
(sighs)

12:42.829 --> 12:44.896
Hey, you still
miss berta?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.331
Miss berta who?

12:46.333 --> 12:49.367
Hey, maybe that's her
last name, "who."

12:49.369 --> 12:51.269
More like, "who cares."

12:51.271 --> 12:53.605
(laughter)

12:53.607 --> 12:56.007
Oh, my god, look at this!

12:56.009 --> 12:57.976
And for dessert,

12:57.978 --> 13:00.111
When your tummy
starts to rumble,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.313
There's helen's apple crumble.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.414
(laughs)

13:03.416 --> 13:05.350
Shut your mouth.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.318
I won't.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.787
You shouldn't.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.321
(laughter)

13:10.323 --> 13:13.024
The only thing berta ever made
with an apple was a bong.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.360
Oh, she sounds
like a hoot-and-a-half.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.261
(laughter)

13:16.263 --> 13:17.862
Well, enjoy, boys!

13:17.864 --> 13:19.998
Oh, no, no, no, no,
come join us.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.033
Oh.

13:22.035 --> 13:25.770
Well, thank you very much.

13:25.772 --> 13:26.805
Oh.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.106
The only thing sweeter

13:28.108 --> 13:31.543
Than your manners
is my peach cobbler.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.013
Spoiler alert-- tomorrow night.

13:36.282 --> 13:39.551
Well, I will be a gobbler
of your cobbler.

13:39.553 --> 13:43.221
I am gonna stitch that
on a pillow.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.126
Oh, do you...
Do you mind if I say grace?

13:48.128 --> 13:51.162
Oh.
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.132
Uh, should I eat this unblessed
biscuit, or spit it out?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.533
Dear lord,

13:55.535 --> 13:58.269
We thank you for
the food that we are

13:58.271 --> 14:01.005
About to receive,
and all of the other blessings

14:01.007 --> 14:03.074
That you have bestowed upon us.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.876
Hmm. That was beautiful.

14:04.878 --> 14:05.877
And we humbly ask

14:05.879 --> 14:08.046
That you help alan and walden

14:08.048 --> 14:09.614
Find the path to righteousness.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.882
Wait.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.150
What?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.418
And lead them out

14:13.420 --> 14:16.788
Of their sinful
homosexual lifestyles...

14:18.224 --> 14:19.757
...Lest

14:19.759 --> 14:22.927
Their souls burn
in the fiery pits of hell

14:22.929 --> 14:27.532
For all eternity
with all of the other sodomites.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.668
Amen. Can I get
some sweet potatoes?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.737
Oh, sure.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.173
Alan?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.641
What? She already thinks

14:36.643 --> 14:39.210
We're gobbling
each others' cobblers.

14:42.948 --> 14:46.284
(humming)

14:46.286 --> 14:47.485
When you're finished
with that dish,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.020
Just leave it,
and I'll take care of it.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.088
Oh, thank you, colleen.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.322
No problem.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.391
I'm gonna go make the beds.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.694
I don't want
to spoil the surprise,

14:56.696 --> 14:58.997
But I'm pretty sure
she was carrying a little bag

14:58.999 --> 15:00.365
♪ of pillow chocolates.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.233
I have to admit,
she's pretty terrific.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.702
Right? I mean, she's
a good cook, she's punctual.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.371
She's accepting
of our lifestyle.

15:06.373 --> 15:11.643
There is no lifestyle to accept.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.344
But if things change,
it's nice to know

15:13.346 --> 15:14.712
We won't lose
a great housekeeper.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.150
(cell phone rings)

15:19.152 --> 15:20.518
That's-that's not me.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.920
Oh, uh, maybe it's colleen.

15:21.922 --> 15:26.524
Um, colleen?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.593
Oh, for the love of god,
just turn it off.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.031
Oh, dear.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.332
What?

15:34.334 --> 15:37.368
Look at this.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.603
Oh!

15:40.339 --> 15:43.308
Okay, I'm-I'm sure there's
a logical explanation for this.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.343
I mean, she's a...
She's a single woman,

15:45.345 --> 15:47.211
Probably just trying
to protect herself.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.280
So, what's this one for?

15:50.716 --> 15:53.117
She has two guns?

15:53.119 --> 15:55.420
Uh...

15:55.422 --> 15:58.323
I count four...

15:58.325 --> 16:01.192
And what looks like a shank.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.528
Okay, you get to fire this one.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.996
Colleen:
Did I hear my phone?

16:04.998 --> 16:07.031
(screaming)

16:08.334 --> 16:10.868
Alan has something
he'd like to tell you.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.839
I think I made
a pillow chocolate

16:14.841 --> 16:16.941
In my boys' huskies.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.212
Okay. Well,
our last housekeeper,

16:21.214 --> 16:23.281
Um, cleaned.
Mm.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.083
And, uh, sometimes
cooked for us.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.851
Is that something that
you're comfortable with?

16:26.853 --> 16:29.153
Sure. What would you like me
to cook?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.255
Oh, I-I don't know.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.358
For breakfast,
I like pancakes.
Mm-hmm.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.695
Of course. <i>Pancakes!</i>

16:37.697 --> 16:40.665
I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.133
You see
an african-american woman,

16:42.135 --> 16:43.835
And the first thing
you think is,

16:43.837 --> 16:46.004
"aunt jemima going to whip us up
some flapjacks."

16:46.006 --> 16:47.472
Walden:
Oh!

16:47.474 --> 16:49.207
No! No! No!
No, no. Um...

16:49.209 --> 16:51.109
Do I need
to bring my own bandana,

16:51.111 --> 16:53.411
Or are you going
to supply me with one?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.380
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
We just, uh...

16:55.382 --> 16:57.081
You know, we really
like pancakes.
Yeah.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.484
But, you know, I suppose
waffles are-are fine.
Yeah, waffles.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.286
<i>Chicken</i> and waffles?

17:02.288 --> 17:04.222
You know what? Let's...

17:04.224 --> 17:05.923
Let's just forget
breakfast.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.825
I'll just... I'll
just have coffee.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.227
How do you take it?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.495
Bla...

17:12.898 --> 17:14.599
I prefer tea.

17:16.168 --> 17:19.070
Um, so, are you okay
with doing laundry?

17:19.072 --> 17:21.472
Yeah. And I suppose
you want me

17:21.474 --> 17:25.209
To separate the whites
from the colors.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.414
Um, but you are aware

17:29.416 --> 17:31.516
You're applying for a
job as a housekeeper?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.818
Oh, so, now I don't know
why I'm here?

17:34.787 --> 17:37.288
Um, I'm not sure you do.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.791
What?!
Okay, okay.
Let's...

17:41.160 --> 17:42.593
Everybody just calm down.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.529
Oh, so now I've got to calm down

17:44.531 --> 17:46.798
Just because I was diagnosed
with schizophrenia?!

17:48.200 --> 17:50.501
Can you believe
these fools, donny?

17:57.209 --> 18:00.945
Okay, I think we have all
the information we need.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.381
Mm-hmm.
Um... We'll
be in touch.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.750
Great.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.052
Let me know
if you need any references.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.223
Oh, you all have a lovely home.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.292
(laughs)

18:15.961 --> 18:19.097
Donny, come on now!

18:21.800 --> 18:24.068
No, no. You know what?
I changed my mind.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.803
I don't want to
talk to berta.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.439
Too bad. You wouldn't let
a topless maid make your bed,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.074
And now you've got
to lie in it.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.644
All right, well, I am
not going to apologize.

18:33.646 --> 18:34.812
You won't have to.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.781
She said if you made
an effort and came to her,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.683
That she'd be more
than happy to apologize to you.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.253
Zippy says you
want to apologize.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.890
See what I did there?
Can we come in?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.892
No, place is a mess.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.995
I was a jerk
to my housekeeper, so she quit.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.064
Okay, that's it.
I'm out of here.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.533
Oh, come on, walden! Is it that
difficult to say you're sorry?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.835
It is when you have nothing
to say you're sorry for.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.538
Are you that clueless?
You hurt my feelings.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.541
You hurt <i>my</i> feelings,
<i>and</i> you smoked all my pot,

19:03.543 --> 19:06.611
So I had no way of not feeling
what I was feeling.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.580
Okay, okay,
dialogue is good.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.382
Now let's see if we can find
some common ground.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.216
You're an idiot.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.518
Agree.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.923
Look, I... I...

19:18.925 --> 19:22.126
Was trying to help you
because I care about you.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.795
Not because I see you
as a charity case.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.998
And I'm sorry if you got
the wrong impression.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.534
I'm sorry I overreacted.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.536
Besides, I was so high,

19:31.538 --> 19:34.205
I thought
you were a talking dragon.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.779
It is really good stuff.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.049
That's the stuff I give
my grandkids at christmas.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.887
It's funny 'cause I get it
from a guy named jesus.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.091
So, what do you say?
Will you come back?

19:54.093 --> 19:56.127
I don't know.

19:56.129 --> 19:58.329
You may be right.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.566
I might not be able
to do everything I used to do.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.868
Well, we'll work around it,
right?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.003
Oh, absolutely.
What-whatever it takes.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.372
Deal?

20:08.374 --> 20:10.074
Deal.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.076
Come on in, I'll make
you a cup of coffee.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.644
(laughing)

20:18.984 --> 20:20.651
Not funny!

20:20.653 --> 20:22.520
Mm.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.928
Still not funny!

20:38.036 --> 20:40.037
I'm glad you're back.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.441
Me, too, and I really appreciate
you getting me some help.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.443
It's the least
I could do.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.345
And I have to admit,

20:47.347 --> 20:49.080
Alan was right about
hiring a topless maid.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.215
Oh.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.657
If it wasn't in the hamper,
it's not going in the washer.
