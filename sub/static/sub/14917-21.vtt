00:00.840 --> 00:05.580
* saw you at a partyin the summertime *

00:07.190 --> 00:10.740
Remember,down t slides,not up.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.080
Here you go.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.960
What is this?Is this ice cream?

00:14.960 --> 00:17.480
It's frozen yogurt,and you're welcome.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.030
Okay,look,you've gotta stop bringing me things to eat.

00:20.030 --> 00:23.730
Not only am I gonna get fat,but--but you can't bring things that melt.

00:23.730 --> 00:26.770
I mean,what would you have done if I hadn't been here today?

00:26.770 --> 00:30.410
Well,you've been here every day so far.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.810
How did you know that this was my favorite?

00:38.810 --> 00:43.130
Well,I thought I'd finally read your book,which I loved,by the way.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.830
No,no,I loved it.

00:44.830 --> 00:47.000
I thought you really captured something about presidential campaigns.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.840
Wait,how'd you put it?You got by on naps,hors d'ouevres and,

00:50.840 --> 00:53.950
uh,vanilla bean frozen yogurt with chocolate chips.

00:53.950 --> 00:56.350
Told you I read it.

00:56.510 --> 00:58.370
Thank you.

00:58.370 --> 01:00.050
and I'm not wrong.

01:00.050 --> 01:02.430
It is delicious.

01:06.390 --> 01:08.820
So how's robert?

01:08.820 --> 01:11.370
well,he's-- he's,uh,he's better.

01:11.370 --> 01:14.110
He's much better,actually.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.890
nora?

01:28.140 --> 01:31.620
Oh,I-I know I look like a dog that's been rolling around in the mud.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.520
Keeping yourself occupied?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.420
Trying not to think about tommy.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.800
Started on the annuals a few days ago.That's the zinnias.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.770
Zinnias are great because they come in different colors,

01:39.770 --> 01:43.520
like cherry and white and disco mix,which is a mahogany with a red center.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.110
Nora,I spoke to him this morning.

01:47.110 --> 01:49.470
Oh,my god.Where is he?Is he all right?

01:49.470 --> 01:50.870
He's okay.

01:50.870 --> 01:53.590
I told him holly got the D.A.To agree to drop the charges,

01:53.590 --> 01:56.470
that it's legally safe for him to come home.

01:56.470 --> 01:58.280
-And?-And he's booking a ticket.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.970
He's coming home this week.

01:59.970 --> 02:03.460
Oh,why didn't you say so?You let me prattle on about these damn flowers.

02:03.460 --> 02:08.150
Nora,tommy and I have a lot to deal with before I can be as excited as you are.

02:08.150 --> 02:11.720
Yes,I know,and I promise,I'm gonna give you two all the space you need.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.280
I won't come over.I won't even call until you--

02:13.280 --> 02:14.910
that's a good idea.

02:14.910 --> 02:18.670
-I know how much you want to see him--
-are you gonna give him a chance?

02:18.670 --> 02:21.000
I will.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.920
Good.Good.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.780
What was wrong with the pantsuit?

02:25.780 --> 02:26.930
It was gray and boring.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.720
-No,it was practical,kevin.
-Oh,come on.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.270
I could put a tie on that thing and wear it.

02:30.270 --> 02:32.410
It was recession appropriate.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.990
Oh,my god.

02:34.990 --> 02:36.980
Oh,come on.You-- you can't be serious.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.310
It's a little loud,don't you think?

02:38.310 --> 02:40.260
That is gorgeous.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.390
It's pink.It is hot pink.

02:42.390 --> 02:45.370
-That's fuchsia.
-Whatever it is,it's practically on fire.

02:45.370 --> 02:47.380
Yeah,you would be,too,if you put it on.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.160
you're very sweet to think that I can pull that off.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.680
However,I'm going back to work at my family's company,not at a brothel.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.640
Oh,come on.Look,it's spring.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.880
You said you wanted to meet a man.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.940
God knows I do.It's been so long since I've been touched

03:00.940 --> 03:03.020
-- right,right.So make a statement.Trust me.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.920
Put that on.It'll get you noticed.

03:04.920 --> 03:10.240
Yeah,yeah,it will...from space.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.940
-who is it?
-Mom.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.210
-Hey,mom.
Tommy's coming home.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.210
-Oh,my god.
-What?

03:15.210 --> 03:17.750
-Tommy's coming home.
-Are you kidding me?

03:17.750 --> 03:20.270
-When?
Hey,mom,I'm gonna go for a quick swim.

03:20.270 --> 03:21.670
mom?

03:21.670 --> 03:23.040
-What's with all the dirt on the floor?
-Mom?

03:23.040 --> 03:25.090
I was gardening.Would you get a broom?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.570
Justin--mom?

03:26.570 --> 03:27.420
What?What?

03:27.420 --> 03:29.930
Justin's there.

03:29.930 --> 03:32.130
mom...how do things stand with julia?

03:32.130 --> 03:35.830
Well,she's still upset,of course.But he's coming home.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.830
-That's the first step.Wait a second.
-Tommy's coming home?

03:37.830 --> 03:42.640
Yes,on tuesday.So we all have to welcome him with open arms.

03:42.640 --> 03:47.760
listen,mom,before you get too excited figuring out the menu for tommy's welcome back soiree,

03:47.760 --> 03:51.100
just remember,he and julia,they're gonna need a little time.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.470
Tell her we all need time.

03:52.470 --> 03:56.020
Mom-- mom,we--we've all got a lot of things to figure out,okay?

03:56.020 --> 03:58.490
Okay?So don't pounce.

03:58.490 --> 04:00.810
Listen,you guys,I am not going to pounce.

04:00.810 --> 04:03.240
As a matter of fact,right now,I'm on my way to the nursery.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.730
I'm gonna pick up bags and bags of fertilizer.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.110
Fertilizer?

04:08.110 --> 04:09.340
Yes,fertilizer.

04:09.340 --> 04:14.150
I'm gonna stay away even if that means I have to plant flowers on every square inch of this property.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.339
Okay,mom.Well,good luck with that.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.000
-Bye.
-Okay,bye.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.430
so wait a second,mom.You're saying that you're not gonna be there the second he gets off the plane?

04:24.430 --> 04:27.580
No,I'm not.My god,you guys have no faith in me.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.060
Have no discline?

04:30.060 --> 04:31.940
jeez.

04:32.610 --> 04:33.970
you must be so relieved.

04:33.970 --> 04:37.030
Yeah,of course.I'm--I'm very happy that he's coming home.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.830
Oh,and your mother--she just must be through the roof.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.390
Through the roof?No.She's,uh,halfway to pluto.

04:42.390 --> 04:45.040
We should be so lucky.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.050
what?I'm kidding.

04:48.050 --> 04:52.310
Um,you know,I think that I am gonna go for a walk with evan.

04:57.140 --> 04:58.920
Robert.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.390
Robert,robert,robert,we definitely should not be getting overly excited.

05:02.390 --> 05:04.360
No,I think that's exactly what we should be getting.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.220
No,no,honey.According to your cardiologist,

05:07.220 --> 05:10.180
you have,like,what,what is it,like a week left before--

05:10.180 --> 05:12.230
four days,because believe me,I've been counting.I'm fine.

05:12.230 --> 05:15.990
No,no,no.I'm sorry.I think that we should follow doctor's orders.

05:15.990 --> 05:20.350
-Really?
-Just trying to be careful.

05:20.630 --> 05:22.750
Okay?

05:29.740 --> 05:30.840
I am so sorry.I am so,so sorry.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.260
No,it's fine.The bowl's plastic.

05:33.260 --> 05:35.500
I would've gotten dressed if i would've known you were coming.

05:35.500 --> 05:40.370
It finE.You're crashing on my couch,and I've seen guys in their underwear before.

05:41.340 --> 05:45.820
Would you by any chance want to go for dinner at my parents' house on tuesday?

05:45.820 --> 05:47.080
Your parents?

05:47.080 --> 05:51.740
Yeah,apparently my dad wants to get to know the gentleman that's sleeping on my couch.

05:51.740 --> 05:54.140
I don't know.I don't know.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.500
Oh,god.You know what?Maybe-- maybe this arrangement--

05:56.500 --> 05:59.850
me staying here--are you sure that it's--it's okay?

05:59.850 --> 06:00.930
Yeah,it's fine.

06:00.930 --> 06:04.070
Really?Because justin definitely doesn't think it's fine.

06:04.070 --> 06:09.580
Well,justin and I broke up,and you really should stop worrying so much what other people think.

06:09.580 --> 06:13.530
So you think I should,uh,brave it and have dinner at your parents' house?

06:13.530 --> 06:15.870
It's really not that big of a deal.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.570
Yeah,it'll be fun.

06:17.570 --> 06:20.270
I'd actually like to get to know them,too.

06:20.270 --> 06:22.340
Great.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.010
I can't believe you convinced me to buy this dress.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.210
What?What are you talking about?

06:26.210 --> 06:27.990
-You look so hot in that dress.
-Really?

06:27.990 --> 06:30.530
-You deserve to meet someone.
-God,I hope you're right,kevin.

06:30.530 --> 06:32.250
You know,I really think it's time.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.740
I just-- you know what I miss?

06:33.740 --> 06:39.180
-What?
-I just miss that first touch.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.010
-It's been so long since I've been--
-ohmy god.

06:41.010 --> 06:43.000
Don't--don't look.Don't look.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.310
Don't--just-- stop.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.590
-Bee on my head?
-No,just walk with me.Really slow,really slow.

06:47.590 --> 06:49.510
-Look into this-- look into this--
-oh,get it off.Get it off.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.220
-Look into this window.Don't argue with me.
-What?What?

06:51.220 --> 06:54.040
Don't look over your shoulder.Chad's across the street.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.710
-Chad who?
-chad!

06:55.710 --> 06:59.700
oh,chad.

06:59.700 --> 07:03.870
-Oh,my god.he is so ridiculously chiseled.
-Turn around.

07:03.870 --> 07:05.430
Stop looking.He might see.

07:05.430 --> 07:06.720
What?He doesn't know who I am?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.680
What--what are you afraid of?Why don't you just go say hi?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.440
No,no,that's not gonna happen.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.050
Oh,he really is spectacular.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.370
He's bi,right?

07:14.370 --> 07:15.990
-Maybe you should introduce me.
-What?

07:15.990 --> 07:19.150
I'm 40.I can't be that choosy.

07:19.150 --> 07:21.310
Why did you guys break up anyway?

07:21.310 --> 07:23.500
Why?He was an emotional mess,okay?

07:23.500 --> 07:25.320
Deeply,deeply closeted.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.730
He had a girlfriend who was happy to be his beard.

07:27.730 --> 07:30.430
He practically denied my existence when we were dating.

07:30.430 --> 07:31.990
-what?
-Sorry.He just spotted us.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.140
-Oh,my god.
-He's coming over.

07:33.140 --> 07:36.400
He's coming over.Don't leave my side.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.070
Oh,my god.

07:39.070 --> 07:43.450
Wh--I-- l--

07:49.980 --> 07:51.910
I owed you that,in public.

07:51.910 --> 07:55.510
You know,for how I acted when we dated.

07:55.510 --> 07:58.250
So,kev...how are you?

07:58.250 --> 08:01.670
-Me?I'm--I'm-- married.
-I'm married.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.030
hello?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.620
Is somebody there?

08:18.620 --> 08:20.330
Who is it?Who's out there?

08:20.330 --> 08:22.620
nora.

08:23.140 --> 08:25.910
It's me.Roger.

08:25.910 --> 08:27.320
Roger.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.410
Actually,I could go blind if you keep shining that thing in my eyes.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.400
Sorry.You scared me to death.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.610
Why are you creeping around back here?

08:34.610 --> 08:35.530
Well,I was in the neighborhood.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.860
The neighborhood?You live in london.

08:37.860 --> 08:40.309
Uh,that's true,but I was at this architectural conference,

08:40.309 --> 08:43.120
and I wanted to stop by the center,which I see is up and running.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.050
I'm sorry you couldn't come to the opening.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.900
-Well,I was in london.
-Yes,with your wife.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.930
Well,that's a funny thing.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.870
Um,that's really what I want to talk to you about.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.760
We have been through this,roger.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.550
You have no idea how much I missed you.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.360
Just stop right there.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.220
I have been planting man-in-the-moon marigolds for the better part of three weeks.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.960
I'm trying to deal with a very complicated situation.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.920
You showing up here with your open marriage and--and your--

09:05.920 --> 09:10.030
it's not open,anymore.In fact,it isn't anything.

09:10.030 --> 09:12.020
We got divorced.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.020
Well,I thought you had an understanding.

09:14.020 --> 09:18.630
Uh,we did,but we always said if someone else came along,it would make it obsolete.

09:18.630 --> 09:20.440
Your wife met someone?

09:20.440 --> 09:23.140
No.I did.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.890
And even though she's covered in mud and she's carrying a trowel,

09:26.890 --> 09:30.510
I'd like to kiss her right away.

09:30.510 --> 09:32.090
You wanted to be the only woman in my life.

09:32.090 --> 09:35.020
Well,consider it done.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.070
I don't know what to say.

09:37.070 --> 09:40.110
Well,you don't ha to say anything.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.230
Wait.It's-- it's a bad time.

09:42.230 --> 09:45.420
This is a-a very bad time.My life is a mess.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.770
I mean,it's not just me.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.880
I--I mean,it's a-- it's a really confusing time.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.020
And I mean,look at me.I'm-- I'm gardening at midnight.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.290
I am looking at you,and you look beautiful...

09:57.290 --> 10:00.880
and flawless,and I love you.

10:01.370 --> 10:07.600
And if--if it's all right with you,I think I'm gonna kiss you.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.890

Good morning.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.410
thanks.

10:43.130 --> 10:44.820
oh my god.

10:53.460 --> 10:56.200
"welcome back.Holly"?

10:58.330 --> 11:00.240
Sarah walker?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.590
I'm cal from accounting.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.150
Last week's invoices.

11:04.150 --> 11:07.290
I missed your first reign,but everyone's happy you're back.

11:07.290 --> 11:10.380
Thank you.See you around.

11:15.230 --> 11:17.140
oh,my god.

11:22.660 --> 11:23.690
kevin walker.

11:23.690 --> 11:25.010
Kevin,this is insane.

11:25.010 --> 11:28.710
I've come back,and ojai foods has turned into ojai dudes.

11:28.710 --> 11:30.120
You sound like a gay justin.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.260
No,I'm serious.The place is absolutely swarming with hot men.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.270
I-I can barely handle it.

11:36.270 --> 11:38.840
Well,at least all the eye candy will make working with holly easier.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.770
Actually,she's trying to be nice.She sent me a fruit basket.

11:41.770 --> 11:44.530
Do you think I should get a food taster just in case?

11:44.530 --> 11:46.440
-Probably.
-Oh,my god.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.020
-It's cal again.
-Who?

11:48.020 --> 11:49.950
Cal--the gorgeous accountant.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.290
Cal sounds like a porno name.

11:52.290 --> 11:54.170
What?Wh-- what,and chad isn't?

11:54.170 --> 11:55.930
That's a name I'm trying to forget.

11:55.930 --> 11:58.980
Come on.Don't tell me you didn't enjoy that kiss.

11:58.980 --> 12:01.170
Just because you're married doesn't mean you're dead.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.720
I did like it.That's the problem.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.280
And try not to tell scotty what happened.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.010
You've got nothing to be guilty about.You didn't provoke him.

12:07.010 --> 12:10.950
Honestly,I-I wouldn't blame myself if cal just walked into my office

12:10.950 --> 12:15.610
and blindfolded me and dragged me down to the loading bay and tied me to a truck--

12:15.610 --> 12:18.310
You--you have it really bad.

12:18.940 --> 12:21.790
oh,my god.It's him.It's--it's chad.

12:21.790 --> 12:23.090
Uh,do I take this?

12:23.090 --> 12:24.290
Well,I would.

12:24.290 --> 12:25.870
I've got sex on the brain.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.590
Okay,I'll talk to you later.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.880
hello.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.630
I keep thinking about you.

12:32.630 --> 12:34.750
That's fine.I think about me all the time.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.530
So I was wondering if you'd like to go get a drink tomorrow.

12:38.530 --> 12:39.700
I--yeah.

12:39.700 --> 12:43.590
You--you know,I would,except it's-- you know,it's a school night and...

12:43.590 --> 12:45.000
I'm married.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.880
No,I meant the three of us.

12:47.880 --> 12:52.020
You know,uh,yeah.Well,scotty's pretty busy with work.

12:52.020 --> 12:55.770
Well,why don't you ask scotty?You still have my number,right?

12:56.060 --> 12:59.900
Well,I hope I see you soon.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.670
okay.Bye.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.020
life is so much sweeter with a baby.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.250
Why did you guys have to go and grow up?

13:09.250 --> 13:12.000
Well,that was the only way we could get away from you.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.720
Oh,well,now isn't that nice?

13:13.720 --> 13:16.020
-Oh,mom,come on.I was joking.
-I drive all the way up here just to get insulted?

13:16.020 --> 13:20.470
You drove all the way up here to keep you from sitting on julia and tommy's porch...

13:20.470 --> 13:22.860
-that is not true.Not true.
-Tears in your eyes,waiting for tommy.

13:22.860 --> 13:27.160
I haven't thought about tommy one moment all day today.

13:27.160 --> 13:32.090
No.Obsessing about him is not gonna help.It's his life,not mine.

13:32.780 --> 13:35.250
Are you,like...medicated or something?

13:35.250 --> 13:39.330
No,I'M...happy,that's all.I'm just--I'm happy...

13:39.330 --> 13:44.310
Not thinking about all the mistakes I made and what awful mother I am.

13:44.310 --> 13:47.990
And if you promise not to judge me...

13:47.990 --> 13:50.500
I'll tell you-- roger came back.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.260
Roger?

13:52.260 --> 13:55.650
Your british architect/swinr/lover?

13:55.650 --> 13:59.890
Yes,he came back,and he's left his wife.

13:59.890 --> 14:02.080
and he said he loves me.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.470
-and he shows it.He is so--
-oh,my god.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.790
This is the best news I have ever heard.

14:06.790 --> 14:09.560
Okay,now tell me more.Is it completely romantic?

14:09.560 --> 14:12.200
-Are you guys--have you--
-yes,yes,what?

14:12.200 --> 14:15.480
don't even go--well,I-- I can't tell you right now.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.820
There's a father coming this way.

14:17.820 --> 14:20.040
Oh,right.That father.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.900
Oh,I get both you guys today,huh?

14:23.770 --> 14:28.200
uh,well,you--you remember,um,um,uh,uh,alec.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.480
Alec,yeah.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.320
You know what?We were just leaving.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.130
We were?

14:33.130 --> 14:36.860
Well,you know,that's o--that's okay.I didn't have time to buy treats for us today.

14:36.860 --> 14:39.350
It--it's okay.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.170
Treats?He buys you treats?

14:41.170 --> 14:42.530
Well,w--mom,yes.

14:42.530 --> 14:47.040
You know,he buys me frozen yogurt or-- you know,he buys it for all the moms.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.210
kitty has a boyfriend.Kitty has a boy--

14:48.210 --> 14:50.180
mother,you know what?Stop that.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.050
That is not true.I'm married,okay?

14:52.050 --> 14:54.890
He knows I'm married.I'm married.

14:54.890 --> 14:57.890
I was kidding.

14:58.170 --> 15:02.010
Oh,right.I don't--so--so was I.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.890
Come on.Let's go.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.810
Oh,you're home.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.580
You know,since robert's gone,the office is pretty quiet.

15:16.580 --> 15:19.980
Do you want to go out for dinner?I'm taking the night off.I need a break.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.180
Yeah,sure.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.990
Great.I'll hop in the shower.

15:24.420 --> 15:28.000
Hey,um,guess who I...ran into.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.660
Who?

15:29.660 --> 15:31.960
-Chad.
-Chad?Chad?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.300
Your--your ex chad?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.600
Yeah,isn't that-- isn't that weird?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.120
How is he?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.450
He's--he's fine.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.150
I mean,you know,he's so dramatic.

15:39.150 --> 15:41.470
Dramatic?What does that-- what does that mean?

15:41.470 --> 15:45.540
Okay,he--he came up to me on a--on a very busy street,

15:45.540 --> 15:49.640
and he--he gave me a very...big kiss.

15:49.640 --> 15:55.540
Apparently,um,as an apology for being so,you know,so deeply closeted when--

15:55.540 --> 15:58.540
when we dated,but,um,you know,it was all-- it was all him.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.760
I mean,you can ask sarah.She saw the whole thing.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.520
Oh,that--that is dramatic.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.320
Yeah,that's not the half of it.He,um...

16:07.320 --> 16:09.520
he wants to have drinks.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.850
With--with the both of us.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.680
That could be fun.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.360
Fun?Are--are you-- are you being serious?

16:17.360 --> 16:20.550
He--I mean,he--he did kiss me on the street.I thought you'd be furious.

16:20.550 --> 16:22.670
Oh,he's just some crazy actor.What's the big deal?

16:22.670 --> 16:25.310
Anyway,I've--I've met him before.He's--he's nice.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.910
When's he free?

16:26.910 --> 16:29.460
You actually want to do this?

16:29.460 --> 16:32.240
Yes,I-I want to have drinks with dr.Phillip.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.680
I loved him on "tempest island.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.620
" I-I remember when he went undercover to save baltimore from the cassidy family.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.150
Fine,I'm a fan.

16:39.150 --> 16:42.880
You never...cease to surprise me.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.240
Are you sure about this?You know,I mean,chad's pretty full of himself.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.160
You know actors.They alwaystalk about themselves.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.210
Oh,like you don't?Come on.Call him.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.920
Okay.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.750
J--uh,just remember,this is not my idea.

16:58.070 --> 16:59.380
when do you have to go back to school?

16:59.380 --> 17:01.250
Actually,I think I'm gonn take some time off.

17:01.250 --> 17:04.730
Oh,see,that's dangerous.I took time off,and I never went back.

17:04.730 --> 17:07.900
Oh,don't worry.My dad would kill me if I didn't graduate.

17:07.900 --> 17:10.420
I'm just gonna take this semester off,then go back in the fall.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.160
And that's okay with your school?

17:12.160 --> 17:15.839
Yeah,they let you do whatever you want when you get straight a'S.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.890
Straight a'S.

17:18.890 --> 17:21.310
I didn't know you were such a brainiac.

17:21.310 --> 17:23.310
oh,I'm sorry.I thought it was obvious.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.050
Yeah,I,um,I actually left college.

17:26.050 --> 17:27.500
You know,I wanted to direct films.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.710
-How'd that work out for you?
-Great.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.070
I met your mom,didn't I?

17:31.070 --> 17:35.040
And--and how has it been working out for you,not being in school?

17:35.040 --> 17:38.750
Great.I met rebecca,didn't I?

17:39.150 --> 17:41.470
nah,truth be told,I just...

17:41.470 --> 17:43.950
really need to sort some things out right now,you know,

17:43.950 --> 17:46.060
and that's part of the reason I had to leave nora's,

17:46.060 --> 17:50.060
is because it's really hard to get any perspective around the walkers.

17:50.060 --> 17:51.190
meaning?

17:51.190 --> 17:56.370
Meaning they're a big,close family and everything's all perfect and--and easy for them,

17:56.370 --> 18:00.680
and so when something wrong actually does happen,it lands on someone else's doorstep.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.500
Um,you know what?Let's not talk about the walkers.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.310
They're actually not that bad.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.500
Um,does anyone want more wine?

18:08.500 --> 18:12.210
-Uh,yes,please.
-I'll take some,too.Thanks.

18:20.550 --> 18:23.710
Oh,can I help you with that?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.110
Hi,cal.You're,uh,working late.

18:28.110 --> 18:31.480
It looks like we're the only ones still here.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.780
Really?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.300
Are there any moreoxes?

18:36.300 --> 18:39.630
No,that's pretty much it.I'm all mod back in.

18:39.630 --> 18:42.850
Do you want me to help you unpack?

18:42.850 --> 18:44.420
Sure.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.800
oh,I don't want to get it dirty.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.990
Of course.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.060
Over there?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.480
you know what the ironic thing is?

19:00.480 --> 19:05.470
The parts I'm getting offered now are so much better and,well,masculine.

19:05.470 --> 19:07.000
M-masculine?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.480
Anyway,the most important thing is I feel really great about myself.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.210
I can see that.

19:12.210 --> 19:15.310
So anyway,enough about me.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.850
Why don't you guys tell me about the wedding?

19:17.850 --> 19:21.280
Oh,actually,I have,uh,some pictures here on my phone.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.460
It's actually our anniversary in a couple of weeks.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.240
You guys are so cute.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.130
Being surrounded by that many flowers makes anyone look cute.

19:30.130 --> 19:32.560
No,that's not it.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.770
You both are very good-looking.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.520
-Thank you.
-That's sweet.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.350
Baby,take a seat so what's it like being married?

19:41.350 --> 19:42.440
It's great.

19:42.440 --> 19:46.290
Yeah,it's like an episode of "leave it to beaver" without the...

19:46.290 --> 19:47.920
yeah.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.820
I don't think I could handle it.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.410
I mean,I'm just enjoying being free.

19:52.410 --> 19:55.540
I'm fine leaving marriage to the heterosexuals.

19:55.540 --> 19:58.580
You guys ever miss it?

19:58.920 --> 20:00.030
-What?
-I don't know,

20:00.030 --> 20:05.940
sitting at a table like this,knowing that at any moment anything could happen.

20:05.940 --> 20:09.770
Don't you miss that kind of spontaneity?

20:10.160 --> 20:11.710
well,um...

20:13.370 --> 20:16.700
you guys want to get outta here?

20:16.700 --> 20:19.060
Where would we go?

20:19.060 --> 20:21.300
We could go to my place.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.890
Uh,I have a pool.

20:22.890 --> 20:26.320
-A pool?
-Or we could go to your place.

20:27.220 --> 20:32.050
Uh,being married doesn't mean you can't play together,right?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.230
come on.It'll be fun.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.650
it's gotta be here somewhere.

20:44.650 --> 20:45.940
What is it again?

20:45.940 --> 20:50.020
It's a large ceramic pineapple.

20:56.620 --> 20:59.440
Is that it up there?

21:00.250 --> 21:03.290
Oh,you found it.Thank you.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.050
Oh,I got it.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.500
You know,cal,you don't look like an accountant.

21:18.550 --> 21:21.300
It wasn't exactly my dream job.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.280
I used to play...

21:23.290 --> 21:26.300
Baseball,minoleagues.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.790
So...you're an athlete.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.860
I gave it my best shot,but...

21:31.880 --> 21:34.330
I'm a pretty good manager,though.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.200
My niece's softball team is 3-And-0.

21:37.230 --> 21:40.299
Impressive.I bet they adore you.

21:40.620 --> 21:43.300
So do you come from a big family?

21:43.330 --> 21:44.250
Ten siblings.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.440
Oh,my god.

21:45.450 --> 21:46.480
You?

21:46.700 --> 21:52.000
Um,four and a half,but they feel like ten.

21:53.550 --> 21:56.730
Is there anything else you want me to do?

21:58.530 --> 22:00.210
Uh,no.

22:00.310 --> 22:02.100
No.Thanks,cal.

22:02.110 --> 22:04.280
You have a good night.

22:04.570 --> 22:08.300
I'll try.Hopefully there won't be any fires.

22:08.340 --> 22:10.780
Wh--Excuse me?

22:10.810 --> 22:15.020
Oh,I'm a volunteer fireman.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.260
And it's--And it's been a pretty a hot week.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.720
I have noticed that.

22:18.730 --> 22:21.300
Really heating up.

22:27.610 --> 22:30.500
C-Could-- Could you get the door?

22:33.030 --> 22:34.590
Ah,wait,wait,wait.

22:34.610 --> 22:37.600
Um,we need a pen.

22:37.810 --> 22:38.850
What you gonna do with that?

22:38.870 --> 22:42.740
I need you to sign off on a short legal document stating that any intimate act that

22:42.750 --> 22:48.150
might take place between us is utterly consensual and not contingent on anything work related,

22:48.160 --> 22:49.940
like,you know,a promotion or anything.

22:49.950 --> 22:51.070
It is consensual.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.950
I am still your employer.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.830
It's consensual.

22:54.850 --> 22:57.090
Okay,I'll sign anything.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.870
Fill in the terms later.

23:07.060 --> 23:11.060
I want to play you this violin piece.It's french.

23:11.070 --> 23:14.230
Oh,let's go to paris,please.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.540
I know this wonderful hotel,the marais.You'll love it.

23:16.550 --> 23:20.150
We could go back and forth between paris and your flat in london.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.330
And then we could come back here for the winter and put our shorts on

23:22.340 --> 23:27.090
and lie in the backyard,which now will be nothing but a gigantic flower garden.

23:27.100 --> 23:31.520
Or I could sell this house,we could get a little-- Little place athe beach,

23:31.530 --> 23:34.310
not too far,but with no guest room.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.710
We'd sleep at night with the windows open and smell the salt air,

23:37.720 --> 23:40.800
and once a month,I'd buy wine and three books,which we would read.

23:40.810 --> 23:45.970
And that's all we'd do.We'd read,drink and swim.

23:46.030 --> 23:47.430
I'm calling the realtor.

23:47.450 --> 23:49.140
Should we dance?

23:49.150 --> 23:51.300
Please.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.350
No,no,forget the phone.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.110
It might be julia.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.180
Just listen to the music.

24:00.190 --> 24:03.400
But then it'll be about tommy.

24:05.530 --> 24:06.900
Hello.

24:07.750 --> 24:08.930
What?

24:09.740 --> 24:12.600
No,no,no,hold on,hold on,hold on.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.910
It's julia.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.090
I-I have to take this.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.880
Of course,of course.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.280
Julia.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.360
No,no,no,it--It-- It's my friend roger.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.180
What is going on here?

24:30.210 --> 24:31.900
Nothing.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.610
Great.I met rebecca,didn't I?

24:34.620 --> 24:35.430
Oh,come on.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.400
And I'll tell you something else.I'm not real wild about the way he looks at you.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.950
You're crazy.

24:40.970 --> 24:46.640
Rebecca,I'm a guy.He's a guy.Trust me.

24:47.430 --> 24:51.800
Listen,I-I don't want to date anyone right now anyways.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.030
And even though...

24:54.280 --> 24:59.280
It didn't work,I still miss justin.

25:02.420 --> 25:04.660
But don't think I don't know what you're doing right now.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.110
What am I doing?

25:06.130 --> 25:10.300
Even though you're being completely ridiculous,you're...

25:10.340 --> 25:13.600
Acting like my dad.

25:14.030 --> 25:16.220
I kinda like it.

25:16.670 --> 25:19.100
Well,I'm not being ridiculous.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.760
And I'm not acting.

25:22.090 --> 25:25.150
Well,thank you so much for having me and for cooking.

25:25.170 --> 25:29.100
Well,it's nice to finally get to talk to you.

25:30.270 --> 25:32.730
You seem like a really cool mom.

25:35.150 --> 25:37.720
What was your mom like?

25:39.760 --> 25:41.620
I don't know.

25:41.680 --> 25:46.410
I thought I did,but,uh,clearly,she kept a lot of secrets.

25:47.790 --> 25:49.900
Ryan,can I give you some advice?

25:49.920 --> 25:53.280
I mean,I know this is really hard,

25:53.300 --> 25:56.300
but try not to get mired in the past.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.680
You're this wonderful young man,and your life is moving ahead.

25:59.690 --> 26:03.250
Concentrate on that.

26:06.170 --> 26:10.110
Your daughter has been so amazing through all this.

26:10.160 --> 26:14.690
I really wish I knew how to repay her for everything that she's done for me.

26:14.730 --> 26:17.530
Well,I know one thing for sure.

26:17.610 --> 26:22.330
She loves hydrangeas,if you want to thank her.

26:28.490 --> 26:29.360
Should we go to the bedroom?

26:29.370 --> 26:31.500
I can't wait that long.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.380
Hey,are you this horny because we almost had a 3-Way?

26:34.410 --> 26:37.990
M-Me?You could barely contain yourself on the car ride home.

26:40.490 --> 26:41.720
- Is that him?
- Of course it's him.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.370
He knows where you live,right?

26:43.390 --> 26:45.080
He doesn't take no for an answer.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.180
Well,should we let him in?

26:46.190 --> 26:48.260
Are you serious?

26:48.280 --> 26:50.690
Do you want to let him in?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.540
This is how pornos start.

26:52.550 --> 26:54.110
Are we on the same page right now?

26:54.130 --> 26:58.290
I-I can't believe we're doing this.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.680
I'm gonna go get the door.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.310
What are you doing here?

27:09.320 --> 27:11.300
Oh,my god,kevin.You will never believe it.

27:11.310 --> 27:12.810
I had sex in the office.

27:12.820 --> 27:14.990
- I really need to share with somebody.
- Why me?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.220
Because I can't get ahold of kitty,and,well,

27:17.230 --> 27:21.470
before you and scotty got together,you were the most promiscuous member of the family.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.990
Oh,that's comforting to know.

27:28.350 --> 27:31.640
Oh my god,I've done it again,haven't I?

27:31.660 --> 27:32.880
- Were you two about to...
- Oh,no.

27:32.890 --> 27:35.320
Ask kevin.He's the most promiscuous one in the family.

27:35.340 --> 27:36.340
Oh,I'm so sorry.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.740
You're the one who answered the door.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.000
You wanted me to.

27:39.010 --> 27:40.690
No,I didn't.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.650
What's going on?What are you talking about?

27:42.670 --> 27:44.240
Scotty wanted a 3-Way.

27:44.260 --> 27:45.350
Oh,my--Scotty!

27:45.360 --> 27:47.010
I can't believe you actually told her.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.120
She just had sex on her desk.Please.

27:49.130 --> 27:50.510
In the storage room.Please.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.600
You know what?I wasn't the most promiscuous member of this family.

27:52.610 --> 27:54.770
Justin was.I bet you he's had gobs of 3-Ways.

27:54.780 --> 27:58.030
Oh,I doubt it.Anyway,we're talking about you.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.500
Okay,spill the beans.

27:59.510 --> 28:00.830
Who did you think was out that door?

28:00.840 --> 28:02.040
- Nobody.
- Chad.

28:02.050 --> 28:03.410
Oh,nice choice.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.060
I'm not having this conversation with you,sarah.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.190
You walkers have absolutely no boundaries.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.500
Maybe you should've thought of boundaries before you got us into this.

28:09.510 --> 28:10.880
Oh,don't blame this on me,kevin walker.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.040
It takes three to tango.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.560
- He's right.
- Sarah!

28:14.580 --> 28:15.880
Okay,I am completely humiliated.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.380
I am going to sleep.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.550
Good night,both of you.

28:19.570 --> 28:20.860
- Night.
- Great.

28:20.890 --> 28:23.100
I think I just went fm a 3-Way to sleeping on the couch.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.250
I'm so sorry,kevin.

28:25.270 --> 28:26.130
I shoulda called.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.660
You could say that.

28:27.680 --> 28:30.990
You know,I might--I might go home to bed.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.290
I'm sure you guys need to talk.

28:34.350 --> 28:35.030
Oh,wait,wait.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.370
Who--Who did you,uh,hook up with in the,um,in the office?

28:38.390 --> 28:39.320
Caliente.

28:39.330 --> 28:41.700
Not cal?

28:42.570 --> 28:44.310
I'm so sorry about...

28:44.330 --> 28:45.440
Next time,I promise.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.600
Call next time.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.710
Good luck.

28:50.330 --> 28:51.050
Keep those eyes closed,though.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.410
They're closed.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.230
Don't knock I--All right.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.540
All right,you can open 'em.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.950
Okay,I can open them.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.280
It's beautiful.

29:00.290 --> 29:01.650
Well,so are you.

29:01.670 --> 29:07.650
Oh,there is-- There's food,but first I thought we could srt with this.

29:14.030 --> 29:18.590
You got an affidavit signed by your cardiologist giving you permission to have sex?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.650
It's good,right?It's...

29:20.670 --> 29:22.600
It's funny.

29:23.490 --> 29:24.620
It's funny.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.470
It's funny.You're funny.You're funny.

29:30.790 --> 29:32.080
So...Let's eat.

29:32.090 --> 29:32.940
Gosh,you know what?

29:32.950 --> 29:34.760
I'm--I'm starving.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.580
Did you,uh,make your chicken?

29:37.660 --> 29:40.770
I want you to know that I'm fine.

29:40.790 --> 29:43.800
You don't have to be afraid.

29:44.540 --> 29:46.840
I'm not afraid.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.100
I'm just hungry.

29:51.870 --> 29:57.540
And I'm starting to think that this is a little more complicated than just being about my health.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.690
Robert...

30:01.730 --> 30:05.160
All of this is beautiful.It--It...

30:05.180 --> 30:08.490
It's-- I mean,you didn't have to do all this.

30:08.570 --> 30:09.450
It just-- You know what it does?

30:09.460 --> 30:14.570
It--It feels like a lot of,umpressure,honestly.

30:14.580 --> 30:18.550
I mean,it's been a long time since we...

30:18.920 --> 30:21.080
Can we just not make it such a big deal?

30:21.100 --> 30:23.600
It is a big deal.

30:26.480 --> 30:30.790
There's something going on with you,and I want you to talk to me.

30:30.860 --> 30:35.540
But whatever this is,it is not okay.

30:38.410 --> 30:39.940
Well,when you get...

30:39.950 --> 30:45.250
The clarity and the courage to talk to me,you know where to find me.

30:56.130 --> 31:00.550
Uh,given the hour,I thought that coffee might be a bit more appropriate than yogurt.

31:00.760 --> 31:01.570
So here.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.170
Thank you.

31:04.570 --> 31:06.300
So where's ben?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.130
At school.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.800
Yeah,they do that right before they learn how to drive.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.360
You know,I'm...

31:15.390 --> 31:17.950
I'm so sorry that I-- That I called you.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.470
- I don't know.I just--I--
- What?Why?

31:19.480 --> 31:23.550
I just thought maybe you would be able...

31:24.020 --> 31:25.300
To help.

31:25.310 --> 31:27.490
I know that your wife was sick for a long time,

31:27.500 --> 31:31.720
so I j--I just thought maybe you could offer some advice.

31:31.730 --> 31:33.920
Robert and I aren't connecting.

31:33.940 --> 31:37.390
I mean,we didn't connect before the heart attack.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.950
It's,you know-- And don't get me wrong.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.400
I mean,he's a-- He's a great father.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.150
But he's,uh...

31:43.810 --> 31:48.120
You know,he's got a lot of other priorities.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.220
And,uh...

31:51.270 --> 31:53.790
Sometimes it just feels like it's me and evan.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.260
Sounds lonely.

31:55.270 --> 31:59.300
God,god,god,god.I shouldn't be here.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.460
It's okay.

32:00.490 --> 32:02.300
It's okay.

32:02.540 --> 32:04.520
I don't know.It's just-- It's--It's all those things--

32:04.530 --> 32:08.730
All those things that I used to love about him,I...

32:08.740 --> 32:14.180
You know,like his-- His confidence and--And--And his ambition,

32:14.190 --> 32:17.280
it just-- It just is all so...

32:17.300 --> 32:19.780
Disappointing to me now.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.570
Have you told him this?

32:21.590 --> 32:24.280
How do I tell somebody that...

32:24.290 --> 32:29.460
I'm actually...Thinking about...

32:33.500 --> 32:36.280
Why are you telling me this?

32:40.790 --> 32:42.970
Because...

32:42.990 --> 32:45.610
It's easier for me to talk to you than

32:45.620 --> 32:51.370
it is for me to talk to him.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.580
How many of these V.A. Medical programs did you apply to?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.630
Uh,four.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.880
This is--This is great.

33:06.910 --> 33:08.850
I-I didn't even recognize myself.

33:08.860 --> 33:13.600
Yeah,well,hey,maybe you can write one for me,give it to kitty.

33:13.610 --> 33:15.050
What's the matter?

33:15.060 --> 33:15.870
I don't know.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.200
Let's just say that things aren't going well.

33:19.210 --> 33:23.430
Something's changed,and it ain't my life expectancy.

33:24.030 --> 33:28.750
You know,I wish we could just go back to the beginning when everything clicked.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.130
It was all just...

33:30.150 --> 33:31.480
Perfect.

33:31.510 --> 33:38.690
Maybe if I did,then I could see that moment when...

33:39.060 --> 33:40.980
What?

33:42.440 --> 33:44.890
I lost her.

33:53.000 --> 33:53.670
Hello.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.880
Hey,holly.How are you?

33:56.110 --> 33:57.810
I'm fine.

33:57.870 --> 34:00.900
Uh,did you get the fruit basket I sent?

34:00.910 --> 34:05.130
I did.Thank you.That was very generous.

34:05.830 --> 34:08.449
Are you looking for someone?

34:08.889 --> 34:10.929
Uh,have you seen cal from accounting?

34:10.940 --> 34:13.139
I have a little question for him.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.139
Cal?

34:16.600 --> 34:18.870
You mean our resident fireman?

34:18.889 --> 34:20.030
Is he?

34:20.050 --> 34:20.750
I didn't know.

34:20.780 --> 34:23.139
He was a temp.

34:23.170 --> 34:25.389
Boy,am I gonna miss that one.

34:25.409 --> 34:26.530
He was a temp?

34:26.550 --> 34:29.080
Yeah,yesterday was his last day.

34:29.090 --> 34:29.770
Why?

34:29.780 --> 34:33.340
Did you need him for something?

34:33.360 --> 34:34.630
Nothing I can't handle.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.520
You know,crunch some numbers.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.770
Have a nice day.And...

34:39.780 --> 34:43.230
Nice dress,by the way.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.230
Thank you.

34:51.469 --> 34:53.360
Promise me you're not leaving because of me.

34:53.370 --> 34:58.640
No,I have a-A project in,um,well,paris,

34:58.650 --> 34:59.740
and I have to check up on it.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.980
Paris.God,I hate you.

35:01.990 --> 35:04.120
Don't make this any harder than it already is.

35:04.130 --> 35:05.900
I'd love you to come with me.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.620
God,I wish I could.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.790
But I-I tried to warn you when you first got here.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.220
This is such a terrible time for my family.

35:12.230 --> 35:15.660
I can't just sell the house and move to the beach.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.200
The beach house was your idea.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.400
God,it was a wonderful idea.

35:23.420 --> 35:24.590
You got me all excited.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.630
I just started to dream about what my life could be like.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.820
No,you're not dreaming,nora.

35:32.010 --> 35:34.870
I do love you.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.430
Hold that thought,please.

35:37.450 --> 35:39.570
Just for a little while.

35:39.590 --> 35:43.140
I don't know how long it'll take for me to get things straightened out.

35:43.150 --> 35:45.820
I'm not gonna change the way I feel,if that's what you're asking.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.600
Good...

35:48.260 --> 35:55.030
Because I might be feeling the same way,and I'm so surprised that I do,and I'm not gonna give it up.

35:55.050 --> 35:58.530
I hope your son comes home soon.

35:58.550 --> 36:01.310
So do I.

36:29.890 --> 36:32.670
Justin,what are we doing here?

36:33.200 --> 36:34.080
Not even a hello?

36:34.090 --> 36:35.830
Hi,and this isn't gonna work.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.190
You don't even know what I'm gonna say,rebecca.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.690
Justin,this is where we first kissed.

36:38.700 --> 36:39.790
I mean,it's pretty obvious--

36:39.800 --> 36:41.810
All right,listen,will you just sit down?All right?

36:41.820 --> 36:43.630
I'll say what I gotta say,and then--And then we're done.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.650
I swear.

36:56.130 --> 36:59.740
I was the one who said that we needed to keep our families from coming between us,

36:59.760 --> 37:02.350
and I was the one who didn't follow through.

37:02.360 --> 37:06.530
I didn't believe you about tommy and I lied to you about...

37:06.550 --> 37:08.980
Where he was.

37:09.050 --> 37:13.010
I protected my family at the expense of being your boyfriend.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.950
And for that,I'm really sorry.

37:24.830 --> 37:26.940
Wait,you're going?

37:29.410 --> 37:35.400
And the reason why I brought you up here is because it's beautiful,especially in spring.

37:36.450 --> 37:39.970
That's why I brought you here to begin with.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.080
You're back.

37:53.090 --> 37:55.890
I was starting to get worried.

37:55.910 --> 37:58.700
Uh,I just,uh,had a lot to do this morning.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.220
No,no,it's--It's okay.I'm just...

38:01.230 --> 38:04.230
I'm just glad you're home.

38:04.730 --> 38:07.720
Honey,I was at the park.

38:07.730 --> 38:10.310
I just had a lot of errands.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.750
Kitty.

38:13.220 --> 38:15.750
This can't go on.

38:15.810 --> 38:18.650
We have to talk.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.440
I know.

38:20.480 --> 38:23.700
I know.It's just that...

38:24.360 --> 38:29.570
There's nothing I want to say right now.

38:39.460 --> 38:42.180
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.450
I still feel weird.

38:45.940 --> 38:48.500
Yeah,me,too.

38:49.250 --> 38:51.740
Guess who called.

38:51.820 --> 38:55.580
He is nothing if not persistent.

38:56.160 --> 39:00.800
He actually called to apologize for putting us in an awkward situation.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.020
He has notng to be sorry for.

39:02.030 --> 39:03.780
I mean,look at us.

39:03.790 --> 39:08.270
If I were him,I'd want a piece of this action,too.

39:08.790 --> 39:11.640
I didn't mean to lay it all on you,okay?

39:11.650 --> 39:13.150
I was just scared.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.690
Yeah,me,too.

39:16.010 --> 39:17.980
God,we are such prudes.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.750
You're not kidding.

39:18.760 --> 39:23.530
One possible 3-Way,and we practically have a nervous breakdown.

39:23.970 --> 39:26.570
I guess we're more comfortable nesting.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.970
We may as well be lesbians.

39:27.980 --> 39:29.290
Even lesbians have 3-Ways.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.280
Yeah,but their heart's never in it.

39:32.310 --> 39:35.760
So we move on-- Monogamous...

39:35.780 --> 39:39.400
Domesticated,married.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.720
I wouldn't have it any other way.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.300
How you doing?

39:49.320 --> 39:51.220
Uh,I'm fine.

39:53.420 --> 39:56.920
Well,I was,uh,fishing for a compliment,but apparently it's not working.

39:56.930 --> 39:59.510
Oh,my god.You're cleaning.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.300
Oh,I feel like an idiot.I'm sorry.

40:01.310 --> 40:03.180
I-I'm just distracted.

40:03.190 --> 40:06.370
You know,I was thinking about dinner last night,and,uh,

40:06.380 --> 40:12.360
I know you and your mom don't have a simple past,but you have no idea how lucky you are.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.180
You're right.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.470
This thing I can't get out of my mind is--is...

40:17.500 --> 40:20.340
Why would my mom just give up?

40:20.360 --> 40:21.740
- You just--You don't just...
- Ryan...

40:21.750 --> 40:23.360
Choose to--

40:23.390 --> 40:27.570
You can't try to understand what she was thinking.

40:27.740 --> 40:32.280
You just have to know that she loved you.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.200
You're right.

40:36.210 --> 40:40.160
Well...I have some work to do.

40:42.380 --> 40:44.520
Hydrangeas.

40:44.530 --> 40:45.950
They're my favorite.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.530
Really?

40:47.570 --> 40:50.620
I-I guess I just got lucky.

40:53.290 --> 40:55.410
You sure you're okay?

40:57.190 --> 41:01.010
It's just-- It's been a crazy day.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.610
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

41:13.630 --> 41:15.350
Don't be silly.Come on in.

41:15.370 --> 41:20.000
Nora,I finally talked to him.

41:20.070 --> 41:24.240
He changed his mind.He's not coming home.

41:24.270 --> 41:27.130
W-Why?You--You told him the board's dropped the charges.

41:27.140 --> 41:30.490
- It's safe to come home.
- ******

41:30.500 --> 41:32.810
He doesn't know who he is anymore.

41:32.830 --> 41:33.910
I don't know if he ever did.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.080
Well,then he should be with his family and the people who love him.

41:36.090 --> 41:38.100
He does not want to be around us.

41:38.110 --> 41:39.230
He made that very clear.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.300
He wants to be alone.

41:45.590 --> 41:49.660
I think it's time to tell the family.

41:49.870 --> 41:52.860
I'll call them.You don't have to call anyone.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.460
Thank you.

00:00.500 --> 00:10.000
