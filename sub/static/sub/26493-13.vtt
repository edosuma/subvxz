WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:01.706
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:01.710 --> 00:03.997
-DID TYRONE GIVE YOU THAT BAG?
-MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.570
WHATEVER
YOU'RE ABOUT TO ASK, DON'T.

00:05.580 --> 00:06.877
YOUR BOY ALREADY GONE. AIN'T
NOTHING GONNA CHANGE THAT.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.201
IT WAS TYRONE.
HE HAD SHAWN KILLED.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.416
SPENCER:
WHY YOU JOIN HIS CREW?

00:10.420 --> 00:12.161
THESE DUDES,
THEY ABOUT LOYALTY,

00:12.170 --> 00:14.002
BUT THEY GOT TO
TRUST ME FIRST.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.921
SO IF THEY FIND OUT
TYRONE HAD SHAWN KILLED,

00:15.930 --> 00:17.500
THEY GONNA HANDLE HIM
FOR ME.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.887
COOP, THIS IS GONNA
GET YOU KILLED.

00:18.890 --> 00:20.096
OK, I WANT YOU
TO TRAIN ME.

00:20.100 --> 00:20.430
WHY?

00:20.430 --> 00:23.229
I WANT TO BE GREAT,
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

00:23.230 --> 00:24.891
WHO'S EVER HELD ME
TO THAT STANDARD.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.641
WHEN YOU CHOSE
COREY OVER ME,

00:26.650 --> 00:28.937
THAT BROKE THE LAST TETHER

00:28.940 --> 00:31.068
THAT WAS HOLDING ME
TO CRENSHAW.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.310
MAYBE YOUR FATHER--

00:32.320 --> 00:34.732
I DON'T HAVE
A FATHER.

00:34.740 --> 00:35.696
NOT ANYMORE.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.759
BILLY: WINTON MARK,

00:52.760 --> 00:56.503
SCOTT ANDERSON,

00:56.510 --> 00:59.093
JEFF AUSTIN.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.809
THEN WE GOT SHANE BUTLER.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.687
YOU CAN'T FORGET
ASHER ADAMS.

01:06.900 --> 01:12.100
AND, OF COURSE, 1] PARKER,

01:12.110 --> 01:14.898
JORDAN BAKER,

01:14.900 --> 01:16.982
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

01:16.990 --> 01:19.698
YOUR DIVISION PLAYER
OF THE YEAR,

01:19.700 --> 01:21.691
SPENCER JAMES.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.703
NOW, I'VE BEEN HEARING ALL
THIS STUFF ABOUT LOGAN HIGH

01:27.710 --> 01:30.168
KNOCKING OUT
THE FIRST SEED IN PLAYOFFS

01:30.170 --> 01:33.128
TWO SEASONS IN A ROW.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.918
THEY ARE CALLING THEM
THE GIANT KILLERS.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.462
NOT NO MORE.

01:40.470 --> 01:43.553
WE ARE READY FOR
LOGAN HIGH, Y'ALL.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.473
WE ARE READY FOR LOGAN HIGH.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.766
ASHER: 1, 2, 3!

01:47.770 --> 01:49.306
PLAYERS: BEVERLY!

01:49.310 --> 01:52.519
WE ARE NOT READY
FOR LOGAN HIGH.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.568
DAD, WE'RE
THE NUMBER-ONE SEED.

01:54.570 --> 01:55.981
AND LOGAN BARELY MADE IT
TO THE PLAYOFFS, COACH.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.139
THANK YOU. THANK YOU
FOR DEMONSTRATING

01:57.150 --> 01:58.652
WHY WE ARE NOT READY.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.617
THE REGULAR SEASON
IS OVER, Y'ALL.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.577
RECORDS DON'T MATTER.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.572
WHAT DOES MATTER IS THAT THEY
HAVE AN ALL-AMERICAN LINEMAN.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.789
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT THEY
ARE CALLED THE GIANT KILLERS.

02:11.380 --> 02:14.122
BUT WE WILL BE READY.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.713
WE JUST HAVE TO ADD
A WRINKLE TO THE OFFENSE.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.869
A WRINKLE?

02:17.880 --> 02:19.621
THIS SEASON WE HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY RUN

02:19.630 --> 02:20.756
WILDCAT WITH SPENCER.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.921
WE ARE NOW GONNA
START THE GAME

02:21.930 --> 02:23.716
WITH SPENCER BEHIND
THE CENTER

02:23.720 --> 02:24.926
TAKING DIRECT SNAPS.

02:24.930 --> 02:26.216
OK. FOR HOW LONG?

02:26.220 --> 02:27.551
TILL LOGAN ADJUSTS
TO THE DEFENSE.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.050
AND IF LOGAN'S DEFENSE
DOESN'T ADJUST?

02:29.060 --> 02:30.767
-WE WIN.
-WITH ME ON THE BENCH.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.431
YES, WITH YOU
ON THE BENCH.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.851
MOVING ON.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.397
I KNOW Y'ALL REALIZE
IT'S MIDTERMS WEEK.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.606
IF Y'ALL WANT TO BE OUT THERE
ON THAT FIELD

02:39.610 --> 02:42.739
WITH ME ON FRIDAY,
GET YOUR GRADES UP.

02:42.740 --> 02:47.029
ALL RIGHT. GET OUT OF HERE.

02:48.410 --> 02:50.458
MAN: OK, I'll FINISH
GRADING YOUR PAPERS TODAY,

02:50.460 --> 02:52.497
SO, EVERYONE, YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR GRADES BY THIS WEEKEND.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.661
GOOD LUCK.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.956
SPENCER, A MOMENT.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.540
WHAT'S UP?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.678
YEAH, I WAS GRADING THE
ESSAY PAPERS THIS MORNING,

03:04.680 --> 03:06.921
INCLUDING YOURS,
AND YOU ARE AWARE

03:06.930 --> 03:08.807
THAT THIS ASSIGNMENT IS
WORTH 50% OF YOUR GRADE, RIGHT?

03:08.810 --> 03:10.016
YES, SIR.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.306
AND YET YOU STILL
CHOSE TO WRITE

03:11.310 --> 03:12.800
THAT YOUR GREATEST
INFLUENCE IN LIFE

03:12.810 --> 03:14.300
IS NEON DEION SANDERS.

03:14.310 --> 03:16.267
-PRIME TIME.
-WHAT?

03:16.270 --> 03:18.398
THAT'S HIS NICKNAME.
PRIME TIME.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.606
NEON ISN'T HIS NICKNAME?

03:19.610 --> 03:21.237
HE GOT A LOT OF NICKNAMES.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.311
IS THAT YOUR GOAL
IN LIFE, SPENCER,

03:23.320 --> 03:24.731
TO HAVE A LOT OF
NICKNAMES?

03:24.740 --> 03:26.276
I HAVEN'T GIVEN IT
MUCH THOUGHT.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.533
-YEAH, KIND OF LIKE THIS PAPER.
-EXCUSE ME?

03:28.540 --> 03:30.577
I LEARNED NOTHING NEW
OR INSIGHTFUL ABOUT YOU.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.538
PERHAPS FOOTBALL IS
GETTING IN THE WAY.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.872
AND THIS ISN'T
SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH ANYMORE.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.870
AND WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

03:36.880 --> 03:38.791
YOU CAN'T
COAST BY HERE,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.586
EVEN IF YOU ARE
GOOD AT FOOTBALL.

03:40.590 --> 03:42.797
SO WHAT, YOU THINK I'M JUST
SOME DUMB PLAYER FROM THE 'HOOD?

03:42.800 --> 03:44.962
WHAT I THINK IS THAT YOU
SHOULD BE THANKING ME

03:44.970 --> 03:47.632
FOR GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
TO REWRITE THIS ESSAY.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.847
AND HAVE IT IN
BY FRIDAY MORNING

03:49.850 --> 03:52.387
OR YOU'RE NOT PLAYING
IN THAT PLAYOFF GAME.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.020
NEON DEION?

04:03.030 --> 04:04.987
PRIME TIME.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.617
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.826
MA, DUDE CHANGED
THE GAME.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.616
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
SIDING WITH MR. VEGA.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.998
NOT TAKING SIDES.
BUT AT LEAST HE CARES.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.957
MY PROFESSOR DOESN'T
EVEN LOOK UP AT US.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.780
I COULD BUMP INTO HER
AT THE GROCERY STORE,

04:15.790 --> 04:17.622
SHE WOULDN'T KNOW
I WAS IN HER CLASS.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.540
SO WHY TAKE THE CLASS?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.416
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.625
URBAN PLANNING.

04:21.630 --> 04:22.665
YES.

04:22.670 --> 04:24.126
MY ASSIGNMENT THIS WEEK

04:24.130 --> 04:26.542
IS TO TAKE A PLOT OF LAND
RIGHT HERE IN CRENSHAW

04:26.550 --> 04:28.461
AND FORMULATE A PLAN
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

04:28.470 --> 04:30.427
IT CAN BE ANYTHING
I WANT IT TO BE--

04:30.430 --> 04:33.434
A PARK, HOUSE, BUSINESS.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.011
AND MY JOB IS TO WEIGH
ALL THE ISSUES.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.806
YOU LIKE IT?

04:37.810 --> 04:39.608
I LOVE IT.

04:39.610 --> 04:43.319
HEH! YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE
THE WORLD, AIN'T YOU, MA?

04:43.320 --> 04:46.483
I'MMA TRY.

04:46.490 --> 04:48.527
NEON DEION WAS LEGIT, THOUGH.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.520
PRIME TIME.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.191
PRIME TIME.

04:57.460 --> 04:59.246
HEY, DAD.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.582
JUST DRAWING UP
THESE NEW PLAYS.

05:01.590 --> 05:04.412
OH. YOU FORGOT ABOUT
THIS ONE OVER HERE.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.502
THANKS.

05:06.510 --> 05:07.671
WAIT. WHAT IS THAT?

05:07.680 --> 05:08.966
THAT IS THE SIDELINE,

05:08.970 --> 05:11.382
THAT'S YOU, AND THAT IS ME
STANDING NEXT TO YOU.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.301
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

05:13.310 --> 05:14.471
NO, YOU SHUT ME DOWN, DAD.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.970
YOU QUESTIONED
MY DECISION

05:15.980 --> 05:17.300
IN FRONT OF
THE ENTIRE TEAM.

05:17.310 --> 05:19.267
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
ME, RIGHT?

05:19.270 --> 05:21.318
I MEAN, WHY NOW, DAD? WHAT
HAS CHANGED ALL OF A SUDDEN?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.812
I'VE DELIVERED FOR YOU
ALL YEAR.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.561
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
GRANDPA WILLY THINKS?

05:25.570 --> 05:26.981
I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT
GRANDPA WILLY THINKS.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.061
HE SAID YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A CLUTCH PLAYER.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.232
YOU TELL HIM NOT
TO SPEAK FOR ME.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.537
YOU TELL HIM YOURSELF.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.326
HE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW
FOR THE BARBECUE.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.241
WE AGREED THAT THIS
BARBECUE WAS SOMETHING

05:36.250 --> 05:38.537
WE DO AS A FAMILY
ONCE A WEEK.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.417
YEAH, AND HE'S FAMILY.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.087
HOLD UP, HOLD
UP, HOLD UP.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.832
I STILL GOT A LOT OF FILM
ON LOGAN TO BREAK DOWN,

05:47.840 --> 05:52.175
SO I COULD USE
YOUR HELP.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.306
OK.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.767
MAN: ALL I DO IS CASH OUT

06:00.770 --> 06:02.226
ALL DAY

06:02.230 --> 06:03.641
NOW, ALL THESE ...,
THEY WANT ME

06:03.650 --> 06:05.891
AND THEY KNOW I'M
TRYING TO SMASH NOW

06:05.900 --> 06:08.528
ALL I DO IS CASH OUT,
ALL DAY...

06:08.530 --> 06:09.770
TYRONE: WHERE YOU BEEN?

06:09.780 --> 06:11.236
I WAS WITH MALIK.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.651
YO, COOP, I DON'T LIKE
WAITING ON YOU.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.367
SHAWN NEVER MADE ME WAIT.

06:14.370 --> 06:15.781
WELL, SINCE YOU
BRINGING HIM UP,

06:15.790 --> 06:17.406
WHY YOU DON'T GIVE ME
SHAWN'S OLD SPOT?

06:17.410 --> 06:18.571
'CAUSE YOU AIN'T READY.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.662
I COULD SHOW YOU
I'M READY.

06:20.670 --> 06:23.492
ALL RIGHT. SHOW ME.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.629
I'M GONNA ROLL WITH YOU AND SEE
IF YOU CAN HANDLE SHAWN'S ROUTE.

06:26.630 --> 06:27.916
WHAT, YOU GONNA
BE MY DRIVER?

06:27.920 --> 06:30.673
COME ON, BRO.
I COULD DO IT BY MYSELF.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.718
NAH. CONSIDER ME
YOUR BABYSITTER.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.132
THIS OUR DRIVER.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.939
COOP, MEET PREACH.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.681
HE JUST GOT OUT.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.681
WHAT UP, PREACH?

06:46.610 --> 06:48.817
PREACH DON'T SAY MUCH.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.152
LET'S GO.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.400
MAN: GOOD EVENING.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.629
FOR THOSE OF YOU
SQUINTING IN THE BACK,

07:01.630 --> 07:03.496
NO, I AM NOT MRS. HILL.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.411
I'M THE GUY WHO
GRADES YOUR PAPERS,

07:05.420 --> 07:08.082
MICAH RICHARDS, MRS.
HILL'S TEACHING ASSISTANT.

07:08.090 --> 07:10.582
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME TONIGHT,
SO GO AHEAD,

07:10.590 --> 07:14.379
PUT YOUR BOOKS AWAY
SO WE CAN TALK FOR A BIT.

07:16.010 --> 07:19.423
WHY URBAN PLANNING?

07:19.430 --> 07:22.058
URBAN PLANNING IS
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN--

07:22.060 --> 07:24.051
RICHARDS: NO, NO, NO. NOT
THE WIKIPEDIA DEFINITION.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.563
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
THIS CLASS?

07:26.570 --> 07:28.937
BECAUSE IT'S AN ELECTIVE.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.197
MICAH: THAT'S FAIR.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.270
THAT WAS AN HONEST ANSWER.
YOU GOTTA...

07:32.280 --> 07:33.736
GET THAT DEGREE
SOMEHOW, RIGHT?

07:33.740 --> 07:35.322
UM, HOW ABOUT YOU?

07:35.330 --> 07:37.196
ELECTIVE.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.989
OK. ANYONE HERE CHOOSE
THIS CLASS VOLUNTARILY,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.412
NOT JUST FOR A CREDIT?

07:43.420 --> 07:45.411
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
URBAN PLANNING?

07:45.420 --> 07:47.127
FLINT, MICHIGAN.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.950
OH, THE WATER CRISIS.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.837
GOOD, OK.
CLEANING UP THE WATER,

07:50.840 --> 07:53.423
UPGRADING THE PIPES,
DEALING WITH THE HEALTH ISSUES.

07:53.430 --> 07:56.092
SEE, ALL OF THIS TAKES
CAREFUL PLANNING.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.387
ACTUALLY, I WANT TO
PREVENT THE NEXT CRISIS.

07:58.390 --> 08:01.724
OBVIOUSLY, FLINT NEEDS PLANNING
RIGHT NOW TO CLEAR UP THAT TRAGEDY,

08:01.730 --> 08:04.267
BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
NEVER HAPPENED.

08:04.270 --> 08:06.352
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.431
OK.

08:09.860 --> 08:12.443
GOOD ANSWER.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.020
ANYBODY ELSE?

08:14.030 --> 08:16.158
WHY'D YOU PICK THIS CLASS?

08:16.160 --> 08:17.366
ELECTIVE.

08:18.490 --> 08:21.243
MOVING ON.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.412
BILLY: YEAH,
THERE HE GO AGAIN.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.242
JORDAN: YEAH, DUDE'S
A MONSTER.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.957
YO, IS THAT MITCHELL?

08:27.960 --> 08:29.667
YOU'RE GONNA BE RUNNING
FOR YOUR LIFE THIS FRIDAY.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.502
GREAT.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.251
HEY, DID YOU REWRITE
THAT PAPER YET?

08:34.260 --> 08:35.921
MR. VEGA STOPPED BY
MY OFFICE TODAY.

08:35.929 --> 08:39.251
YO, DUDE WILL NOT LET UP.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.807
WHO DID YOU WRITE
YOUR PAPER ON?

08:40.809 --> 08:41.799
NEON DEION SANDERS.

08:41.809 --> 08:43.380
WHAT? PRIME TIME.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.051
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

08:45.060 --> 08:48.815
MAN. YEAH, VEGA, HE
DOES NOT LIKE SPORTS.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.312
HE DOES HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP
YOU OUT OF THAT PLAYOFF GAME,

08:51.320 --> 08:55.200
SO WHATEVER HE WANTS
YOU TO DO, JUST DO IT.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.487
-ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU, DAD.
-ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.

08:57.490 --> 09:00.289
ALL RIGHT, SPENCE, WE GOT
LOGAN'S ENTIRE SEASON HERE.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.406
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET ON IT.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.201
WAIT. WHAT'S THIS?

09:05.210 --> 09:06.700
SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH?

09:06.710 --> 09:08.280
YEAH, I GUESS MY DAD'S
JUST PLANNING AHEAD.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.837
I MEAN, YOU DO KNOW
THAT IF WE WIN OUT

09:09.840 --> 09:11.126
AND THEY WIN OUT,
THEN WE MEET THEM

09:11.130 --> 09:12.791
IN THE STATE FINAL,
RIGHT?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.791
YO, I GOT TO CHECK OUT
MY OLD TEAM.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.211
OH, OK. I'VE SEEN THIS
A MILLION TIMES.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.676
WHY IS THE QUALITY SO BAD?

09:20.680 --> 09:23.217
IT'S JUST ONE OF MY DAD'S
OLD HIGH SCHOOL GAMES.

09:23.220 --> 09:24.847
ANNOUNCER: HANDOFF
TO COREY JAMES.

09:24.850 --> 09:26.807
UP THE MIDDLE.

09:26.810 --> 09:29.802
AND LOOK OUT,
HERE COMES A BURST!

09:29.810 --> 09:31.392
THERE HE GOES.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.483
GIVE THAT KID AN OPENING,
AND HE'S GONE.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.481
TOUCHDOWN!

09:36.490 --> 09:37.946
THAT'S YOUR DAD.

09:37.950 --> 09:40.829
ANNOUNCER: COREY JAMES
JUST DOING HIS THING.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.571
SUCH AN ELECTRIC PLAYER.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.867
MAN, HE HAD SOME
SERIOUS WHEELS.

09:44.870 --> 09:46.452
I KNEW YOUR DAD
PLAYED BALL,

09:46.460 --> 09:49.122
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS SO GOOD.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.950
NEITHER DID I.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.048
WELL, NOW WE KNOW WHERE
YOU GET IT FROM, RIGHT?

09:55.050 --> 09:57.621
MAYBE HE'S YOUR
GREATEST INFLUENCE.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.590
SPENCER: YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN HIM, BABY.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.761
IT WAS LIKE THE OTHER
TEAM WAS IN SLOW MOTION.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.226
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR DAD WAS GOOD?

10:07.230 --> 10:09.471
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GREAT.
NOBODY TOLD ME.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.471
BACK IN CRENSHAW, EVERYBODY
TALKED ABOUT BILLY BAKER

10:11.480 --> 10:13.642
'CAUSE HE MADE IT
TO THE NFL.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.812
BUT WATCHING THAT GAME, MY POPS
WAS THE BEST PLAYER ON THAT FIELD.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.811
WELL, LIKE FATHER,
LIKE SON.

10:17.820 --> 10:19.652
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD
STOP SAYING THAT.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.027
IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE YOU
GOT SOME OF THAT TALENT FROM HIM,

10:22.030 --> 10:23.941
NOT THAT HE DESERVES
CREDIT OR ANYTHING.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.578
<i>331 WHAT'S UP, SPENCE?
SPENCER: HEY, WHAT UP, DOG?</i>

10:26.580 --> 10:28.867
I HEARD VEGA'S ALL OVER
YOUR ASS ABOUT THAT ESSAY.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.702
HE'S JUST MESSING WITH ME
'CAUSE I'M ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.246
I'M ON THE TEAM.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.581
WHO'S YOUR ESSAY ABOUT?

10:33.590 --> 10:36.833
DWAYNE JOHNSON.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.830
THE ROCK?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.296
TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.927
AND WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU KNOW?

10:40.930 --> 10:42.796
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
TO REWRITE MY PAPER,

10:42.800 --> 10:45.007
SO VEGA MUST HAVE LIKED IT.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.889
HEY, LET ME KNOW IF
YOU NEED ANY HELP.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.805
THE ROCK?

10:50.810 --> 10:52.050
DWAYNE JOHNSON.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.937
- I KNOW.
-THE ROCK.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.357
WILLY: 2257

10:57.360 --> 10:59.488
I DON'T SET MINE
A DEGREE OVER 200.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.401
THESE ARE GONNA BE
DRY, BILLY.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.822
DO YOU EVEN GOT ANY
MUSTARD IN THAT RUB?

11:03.830 --> 11:04.945
-NO.
-PAPRIKA?

11:04.950 --> 11:05.940
NOPE.

11:05.950 --> 11:07.827
MY MOUTH'S WATERING.

11:09.750 --> 11:10.990
WHAT DID I MISS?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.583
-OH, BATTLE OF THE BARBECUES.
-UH-OH.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.080
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
FASCINATING.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.546
STOP MESSING WITH
THE TEMPERATURE.

11:16.550 --> 11:17.949
I HATE DRY RIBS.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.543
JORDAN, GET OVER HERE.

11:20.550 --> 11:22.757
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.922
UH-UH. I WILL TEACH MY
SON HOW TO MAKE SOME RIBS.

11:24.930 --> 11:27.513
THE SAME WAY YOU'VE BEEN
TEACHING HIM HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.056
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
DOING ALL THE WORK

11:29.060 --> 11:31.017
WHILE YOU HAVE HIM
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES.

11:31.020 --> 11:32.977
I'M GONNA CHECK ON
THE BAKED BEANS.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.029
-JUST TELL THE BOY THE TRUTH.
-ABOUT WHAT?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.021
THAT YOU DON'T THINK HE CAN
HANDLE THE PRESSURE OF THE PLAYOFFS.

11:40.030 --> 11:42.237
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THE BOY IS UNTESTED

11:42.240 --> 11:44.060
WHEN THE GAME IS
ON THE LINE.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.448
AND PLAYOFFS,
EVERY GAME'S CLOSE.

11:46.450 --> 11:49.579
HE'S BETTER THAN
YOU THINK HE IS.

11:49.580 --> 11:52.038
WILL YOU STOP TRYING TO DRIVE A
WEDGE BETWEEN ME AND MY SON?

11:52.040 --> 11:55.920
YOU'RE DOING THAT
ALL BY YOURSELF.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.584
DRY-ASS BEVERLY HILLS RIBS.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.547
AIN'T GOT NO MUSTARD.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.257
MAN: WHO'S THAT
CREEPIN' IN MY WINDOW?

12:03.260 --> 12:06.343
PLAY LIKE NINTENDO,
SMOKIN' ON THAT INDO

12:06.350 --> 12:09.138
GOT TO GET THE PAPER,
AND I SPLIT IT WITH MY KINFOLK

12:09.140 --> 12:11.381
THE FAMILY MATTERS,
SO I NEVER KEEP MY ENDS LOW

12:11.390 --> 12:13.768
WHAT? BUT CAN YOU RIDE?

12:13.770 --> 12:15.010
HELL NO...

12:15.020 --> 12:16.260
WHAT'S UP, 1.?

12:16.270 --> 12:17.396
WHAT YOU DOING HERE, COOP?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.811
CAME TO PICK
THAT PAPER UP.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.232
YOU GOT SHAWN'S SPOT.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.152
I MISS THAT BOY.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.571
YEAH, ME, TOO.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.491
REMEMBER THAT RED
DUFFEL BAG HE HAD?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.707
YEAH, THAT THING
WAS BEAT UP!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.077
HE GAVE IT TO TYRONE
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.912
BUT I HEARD RAY
GOT IT NOW.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.877
-WHO'S RAY?
-DUDE THAT SHOT SHAWN.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.507
HOW HE GET IT?

12:40.510 --> 12:42.251
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE
STOLE IT FROM TYRONE.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.672
WHAT YOU THINKING?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.216
THINKING ABOUT WHAT?

12:46.220 --> 12:47.790
NOTHING.
WE GOOD, J.?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.256
THAT'S ALL OF IT.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.231
GOT SOME SORT
OF CHEESE.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.947
CHEDDAR, MAYBE?

13:06.950 --> 13:08.987
OH! GRAPE JELLY.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.446
ASHER ATE THE PEANUT BUTTER,

13:10.450 --> 13:12.077
BUT YOU CAN HAVE
A JELLY SANDWICH,

13:12.080 --> 13:14.401
EXCEPT THAT HE
ALREADY ATE THE BREAD.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.957
HOW ABOUT A SPOON?

13:15.960 --> 13:17.917
HOW LONG IS THIS
DUDE LIVING HERE?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.208
SORRY. ALL I HAVE IS
A SPOONFUL OF JELLY.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.258
THE BAKERS ARE HAVING THEIR
WEEKLY FAMILY BONDING BARBECUE,

13:23.260 --> 13:25.331
SO I'll GET SOME RIBS
WHEN I GET BACK.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.001
OK. PAPER'S DUE TOMORROW?

13:27.010 --> 13:28.637
YEP.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.426
YOU ANY CLOSER
TO AN ANSWER?

13:30.430 --> 13:31.920
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE FOR
EVERY QUESTION I HAVE,

13:31.930 --> 13:33.728
I REALIZE I AIN'T
GOT THE ANSWERS.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.220
WHO DOES?

13:35.230 --> 13:37.471
MAYBE MY MOM.

13:37.480 --> 13:41.018
AT LEAST YOU HAVE YOUR MOM
HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

13:41.020 --> 13:45.355
I HAVE A MILLION QUESTIONS
I WANT TO ASK MY MOM, BUT...

13:45.360 --> 13:47.021
EVEN THOUGH THEY'LL
NEVER BE ANSWERED,

13:47.030 --> 13:49.112
I STILL KNOW HOW
SHE INFLUENCED ME.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.862
REMEMBER, SPENCER,
THE ESSAY IS ABOUT YOU.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.861
YOU THINK I COULD
READ YOUR ESSAY?

13:53.870 --> 13:56.498
I MEAN, IT MIGHT HELP ME
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WRITE.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.959
UM, I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT REALLY
READY TO SHOW IT TO ANYONE YET.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.280
IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.042
TOO PERSONAL FOR ME?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.757
I THOUGHT YOU TRUSTED ME
WITH STUFF LIKE THAT.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.467
I DO TRUST YOU.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.461
JUST, YOU GONNA ASK TO
READ MY DIARY NEXT?

14:08.470 --> 14:10.598
NO.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.591
OK, I GET IT. YOU AIN'T GOT
TO SHOW ME EVERYTHING.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.261
I'll FIGURE IT OUT.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.669
OK, NOW YOU'RE LEAVING?

14:15.680 --> 14:16.886
HEY, I'M NOT MAD.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.517
I'M JUST LATE FOR
THE BARBECUE.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.181
I'll CALL YOU LATER.

14:20.190 --> 14:23.262
MAN: WE MAY BE FINE NOW

14:23.270 --> 14:26.399
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME NOW

14:26.400 --> 14:28.812
IT COMES AND IT GOES

14:28.820 --> 14:32.939
I'll SEE YOU
ON THE WAY OUT

14:32.950 --> 14:36.659
UH, FLINT, RIGHT?

14:36.660 --> 14:37.957
WHAT?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.031
YOU'RE FLINT, MICHIGAN.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.530
ACTUALLY,
MY NAME IS GRACE.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.281
NO, SORRY.
I MEANT YOU, UM,

14:43.290 --> 14:45.042
YOU HAD THAT SMART
ANSWER IN CLASS ABOUT--

14:45.050 --> 14:47.212
FLINT. GOT IT.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.008
HOW'S THE HYPOTHETICAL LAND
USE ASSIGNMENT COMING ALONG?

14:50.010 --> 14:52.001
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN I THOUGHT,

14:52.010 --> 14:54.058
BUT I'M ENJOYING IT.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.300
CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE?

14:55.310 --> 14:56.596
MM-HMM.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.090
DON'T DO A PLAYGROUND.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.683
LIKE, EVERYBODY
CHOOSES A PLAYGROUND.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.931
OH. OK.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.432
YOU WERE GONNA DO
A PLAYGROUND? HA HA!

15:05.440 --> 15:07.431
BACK TO SQUARE ONE,
I GUESS.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.101
ONE MORE THING.

15:09.110 --> 15:11.659
THE CRIME AND THE LAND VALUE
BALANCE EACH OTHER OUT,

15:11.660 --> 15:13.731
SO DON'T OVERCALCULATE
THOSE NUMBERS.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.788
DO YOU MIND
IF I WRITE THIS DOWN?

15:15.790 --> 15:17.827
I'M FREE NOW IF YOU WANT
TO GET SOME COFFEE,

15:17.830 --> 15:19.241
AND WE CAN TALK MORE
ABOUT IT.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.321
UM, I--I GOT TO
GET HOME.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.241
HOW ABOUT IF WE
GET THE COFFEE TO GO

15:25.250 --> 15:28.834
AND WE TALK WHILE
I WALK YOU?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.842
OK. HEH.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.057
COOL. HA HA.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.681
MM-HMM.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.682
DAMN! SOMETHING
SMELLS GOOD.

15:46.690 --> 15:48.601
LAURA: HEY.
SPENCER: WHAT'S UP?

15:48.610 --> 15:50.521
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?
YOU FINISH THAT PAPER?

15:50.530 --> 15:52.020
-NOT YET.
-TOMORROW.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.520
- I KNOW,
-GET IT DONE.

15:53.530 --> 15:54.941
- I WILL.
-LEAVE HIM ALONE, DAD.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.486
LAURA: SPENCER,
GO GET SOME RIBS.

15:56.490 --> 15:58.481
YES, MA'AM.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.653
SO WHAT'S THIS PAPER
ABOUT, YOU GUYS?

16:01.660 --> 16:03.492
WHO IS YOUR
GREATEST INFLUENCE?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.958
INTERESTING.
WHO'D YOU PICK?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.496
I DON'T HAVE VEGA'S CLASS.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.127
HUH.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.292
DO YOU?

16:11.300 --> 16:13.541
YEP.

16:13.550 --> 16:15.461
OK, THEN.

16:15.470 --> 16:18.132
GREAT FAMILY TIME.

16:19.890 --> 16:22.382
LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

16:28.230 --> 16:29.891
HEY, CAN I ASK
YOU SOMETHING?

16:29.900 --> 16:31.482
WHAT YOU NEED?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.606
YOU EVER GO TO BILLY'S
HIGH SCHOOL GAMES?

16:33.610 --> 16:35.612
NEVER MISSED ONE.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.736
AND MY DAD
NEVER SAW ME PLAY.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.617
HE WAS PRETTY GOOD
BACK THEN, THOUGH, RIGHT?

16:39.620 --> 16:40.997
-YOUR POPS?
-YEAH.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.616
BETTER THAN GOOD.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.827
NFL TALENT. COULD HAVE
MADE IT TO THE LEAGUE.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.571
SO WHY DIDN'T HE?

16:46.580 --> 16:49.459
THE WAY I HEARD IT,
THE COLLEGE GRIND

16:49.460 --> 16:51.701
WAS MESSING UP A GOOD THING
HE HAD WITH YOUR MOM,

16:51.710 --> 16:54.372
SO HE TOOK A YEAR OFF
TO START A LIFE WITH HER.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.007
BUT AFTER THAT YEAR--

16:56.010 --> 16:57.500
HE MISSED HIS WINDOW.

16:57.510 --> 17:00.218
AT THAT LEVEL, IT'S NOT
EASY TO GET BACK IN.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.596
BUT HE GOT THE GIRL.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.477
YEAH, THEN HE LEFT HER.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.268
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY GIVE UP
THEIR NFL DREAM FOR THEIR FAMILY

17:08.270 --> 17:10.227
AND THEN WALK OUT
ON THEIR FAMILY?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.561
THAT DON'T MAKE
NO SENSE.

17:15.030 --> 17:17.692
WHAT HAPPENED, POP?

17:17.700 --> 17:21.489
THAT'S A QUESTION
FOR YOUR MOM, SON.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.128
NO WAY. I AM NOT WASTING
MY LAND ON A PARKING LOT.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.121
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR LAND.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.178
I MEAN, IT'S PUBLIC LAND YOU'VE
BEEN HYPOTHETICALLY ENTRUSTED WITH.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.830
TO DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY COMMUNITY,

17:37.840 --> 17:39.592
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.420
I'M CHOOSING
A PLAYGROUND.

17:41.430 --> 17:43.888
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST PLAYGROUNDS?

17:43.890 --> 17:45.631
I GOT BEAT UP ON ONE?

17:47.520 --> 17:49.682
AND THE MERRY-GO-ROUND
ALWAYS MADE ME SICK.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.608
I THINK THIS COULD WORK.

17:55.610 --> 17:58.773
YEAH. ME, TOO.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.612
THE PLAYGROUND.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.782
RIGHT. THAT--
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

18:07.790 --> 18:10.327
-MM. MM-HMM.
-YEAH. YEAH.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.992
UM, MIND
IF I GET A REFILL?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.582
SURE.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK.

18:14.590 --> 18:17.298
NO, I'll GET IT.
YOU SIT.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.460
HEY, MA.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.131
HEY.

18:26.140 --> 18:27.687
LOOK, I GOT TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT--

18:27.690 --> 18:30.057
SPENCER, I, UM, HAVE...

18:32.650 --> 18:34.186
WHO'S THIS?

18:34.190 --> 18:36.488
-SPENCER, THIS IS MICAH.
-HEY.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.561
I'M A TEACHING ASSISTANT
AT PALM STATE.

18:38.570 --> 18:40.356
YOUR MOM IS ONE
OF OUR BEST STUDENTS.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.112
YOU DATE
ALL YOUR STUDENTS?

18:42.120 --> 18:45.329
EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.037
COME IN HERE.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.661
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?

18:50.670 --> 18:52.331
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

18:52.340 --> 18:53.956
YOU'RE BRINGING SOME
DATE HOME? WHERE'S DILLON?

18:53.960 --> 18:56.088
WITH A FRIEND.
LOWER YOUR VOICE.

18:56.090 --> 18:57.967
AND THIS ISN'T A DATE.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.711
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY DAD LEFT.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.586
SPENCER, WE ARE NOT HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.968
WHY YOU AIN'T TELL ME HE
GAVE UP A SHOT AT THE NFL?

19:03.970 --> 19:06.632
DUDE WAS A FOOTBALL
STAR, MA, JUST LIKE ME.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.096
ALL THESE YEARS
I'VE BEEN PLAYING BALL,

19:08.100 --> 19:09.636
YOU AIN'T ONCE SAID
I REMINDED YOU OF HIM.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.971
FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.516
SECOND, I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING

19:12.520 --> 19:13.931
BECAUSE ANYTIME SOMEONE
MENTIONS YOUR DAD,

19:13.940 --> 19:15.567
YOUR HEAD EXPLODES.

19:15.570 --> 19:17.390
YOU REALIZE YOU STILL AIN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.890
WHY DID HE LEAVE US, MA?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.140
EXCUSE ME.

19:20.150 --> 19:22.403
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THIS IS COMING FROM,

19:22.410 --> 19:24.071
BUT YOU HAVE EMBARRASSED ME
ENOUGH IN FRONT OF MY GUEST.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.821
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.491
-MA, COME ON.
“WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.747
MAN: WHAT'S UP, FOOL?
WHAT'S UP, FOOL

19:35.750 --> 19:37.798
KEEP ME IN THE LOOP,
MAYBE GIVE IT TO A "G"

19:37.800 --> 19:40.212
I KNOW WHAT TO DO,
WE WASN'T PLAYING BAD BOY

19:40.220 --> 19:41.710
ALL I DO IS SNOOP...

19:41.720 --> 19:43.677
SO YOU GOT SHAWN'S
SPOT PERMANENTLY?

19:43.680 --> 19:45.671
MAYBE. WE'LL SEE.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.808
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S GONE.

19:47.810 --> 19:51.223
YEAH, MAN. YOU KNOW SHAWN
ALWAYS HAD YOUR BACK, JAMAL.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.597
WHAT YOU TALKING
ABOUT, COOP?

19:53.600 --> 19:55.762
I'M JUST SAYING, HE THOUGHT
YOU WAS UNDERVALUED.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.681
PREACH: COOP.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.148
IT'S TIME TO GO.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.501
ASHER: ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE
TELLING ME SOME RANDOM DUDE

20:25.510 --> 20:27.751
WAS AT YOUR HOUSE TRYING
TO MACK ON YOUR MOM?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.263
I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE SAY
"MACKING" NO MORE, MAN...

20:31.390 --> 20:33.188
BUT IT LOOKED
LIKE HE WAS JUST

20:33.190 --> 20:35.397
HELPING HER
WITH SCHOOLWORK.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.610
LOOK. I KNOW THAT MOVE.
THAT'S MY MOVE.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.396
WHAT'S YOUR MOVE?

20:41.400 --> 20:44.700
GO TO A GIRL'S HOUSE,
PRETEND TO BE FRIENDS,

20:44.700 --> 20:46.566
HELP HER WITH
HER HOMEWORK.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.153
ONE THING LEADS
TO ANOTHER, AND--

20:49.160 --> 20:51.993
DUDE, HOW LONG ARE
YOU LIVING HERE?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.570
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

20:53.580 --> 20:55.821
MARTINI TIME.
YOU WANT ONE?

20:55.830 --> 20:57.662
NO, NO. I DON'T
WANT TO INTERRUPT

20:57.670 --> 20:59.331
YOUR LITTLE BROMANCE.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.297
HA HA!

21:01.300 --> 21:05.214
HEY, LEILA, WAIT UP.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.086
LOOK. I JUST WANT
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.251
SPENCER, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO--

21:08.260 --> 21:10.217
YES, I DO. LOOK.

21:10.220 --> 21:12.348
IT WASN'T COOL OF ME TO
ASSUME I COULD READ IT,

21:12.350 --> 21:14.887
AND I KNOW IT WASN'T
EASY FOR YOU TO WRITE

21:14.890 --> 21:16.301
ABOUT YOUR MOMS.

21:16.310 --> 21:17.721
YOU'RE NOT READY TO
SHARE THOSE FEELINGS.

21:17.730 --> 21:18.936
I RESPECT THAT,

21:18.940 --> 21:22.399
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LEFT LIKE THAT.

21:22.400 --> 21:27.236
LOOK. I TOLD YOU, I'M
A WORK IN PROGRESS,

21:27.240 --> 21:29.777
BUT I REALLY
AM SORRY, OK?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.906
CAN I SHOW YOU
SOMETHING?

21:33.910 --> 21:36.038
YEAH.

21:45.550 --> 21:47.211
THIS IS CRAZY.

21:47.220 --> 21:49.348
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
THIS ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.421
EVERY RECORD PRODUCER
HAS ONE OF THESE ROOMS.

21:51.430 --> 21:53.387
GOT TO DISPLAY
THEM AWARDS, RIGHT?

21:53.390 --> 21:55.051
I GUESS.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.381
I DIDN'T BRING YOU IN HERE
TO SHOW YOU HIS AWARDS.

21:57.390 --> 22:01.566
I'M PROUD OF HIM, BUT
I'M MORE PROUD OF THIS.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.278
THESE ARE
SONGS MY MOM WROTE.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.362
-FOR REAL?
-MM-HMM.,

22:09.370 --> 22:11.156
YO, I HEARD
OF THAT ONE.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.367
YOU PROBABLY HEARD A LOT
OF THE SONGS SHE WROTE.

22:13.370 --> 22:16.328
IT'S HOW SHE MET MY DAD.
SHE WROTE A LOT OF HIS HITS.

22:16.330 --> 22:19.493
WHY YOU
SHOWING ME THIS?

22:19.500 --> 22:22.959
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE,

22:22.960 --> 22:26.089
I LIKE KNOWING THAT SHE
WAS GREAT AT SOMETHING,

22:26.090 --> 22:28.377
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD
ISN'T AROUND ANYMORE

22:28.380 --> 22:31.008
BUT YOU FOUND OUT HE
WAS GREAT AT FOOTBALL,

22:31.010 --> 22:33.001
AND MAYBE SOMEDAY,
YOU'LL BE GLAD

22:33.010 --> 22:35.638
YOU KNOW THAT
ABOUT HIM.

22:37.270 --> 22:40.433
OH, DAMN IT, ASHER. HA HA!

22:40.440 --> 22:42.397
SERIOUSLY,
HOW LONG IS HE STAYING?

23:00.620 --> 23:02.167
-HEY.
-HEY.

23:02.170 --> 23:03.740
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.206
FOUND SOME MORE
OF YOUR MOM'S SONGS.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.508
DID I SAY YOU
COULD READ THAT?

23:07.510 --> 23:09.126
I'M SORRY.
I JUST ASSUMED THAT--

23:09.130 --> 23:12.384
DON'T ASSUME,
NOT IN THIS ROOM.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.342
LEILA...

23:19.980 --> 23:23.473
MAN: PUSH IT HARDER

23:23.480 --> 23:27.565
MAKE IT STRONGER...

23:27.570 --> 23:29.777
GOOD JOB. COME ON, BOY.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.192
-OH, MAN.
-HA HA HA!

23:32.200 --> 23:34.020
-THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.
-NO.

23:34.030 --> 23:36.829
THOSE 12 BARBECUED RIBS YOU
PUT DOWN WERE THE BAD IDEA.

23:36.830 --> 23:38.946
YOU HAD MORE THAN ME.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.577
I DON'T HAVE
A GAME TOMORROW.

23:40.580 --> 23:41.991
YEAH. NEITHER DO 1.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.286
DON'T WORRY.

23:43.290 --> 23:44.837
YOU'RE GETTING
ON THAT FIELD TOMORROW,

23:44.840 --> 23:46.205
AND YOU'RE GONNA SHOW
YOUR POPS WHAT YOU CAN DO.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.702
HE'S SEEN WHAT
I CAN DO, OK?

23:48.710 --> 23:50.337
I'VE BEEN HIS
QUARTERBACK ALL SEASON,

23:50.340 --> 23:51.967
BLOWING TEAMS OUT
LEFT AND RIGHT.

23:51.970 --> 23:54.041
HE DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE BLOWOUTS.

23:54.050 --> 23:56.849
HE CARES ABOUT
THE 3 CLOSE GAMES.

23:56.850 --> 23:58.136
YEAH, AND I WON
TWO OF THOSE GAMES.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.847
WITH YOUR FEET.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.807
BOTH GAMES, YOU HAD
AN OPEN RECEIVER

24:01.810 --> 24:03.767
IN THE BACK OF
THE END ZONE.

24:03.770 --> 24:06.102
YOU FELT THE PRESSURE
OF THE DEFENSE,

24:06.110 --> 24:08.852
SO YOU LEFT THE POCKET
TOO SOON.

24:08.860 --> 24:10.680
YOU TRY TO RUN LIKE THAT
AGAINST LOGAN,

24:10.690 --> 24:13.694
AND MITCHELL IS GONNA
LIGHT YOU UP.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.479
BILLY NEEDS TO SEE
A KILLER INSTINCT.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.868
SO HE HAD
A KILLER INSTINCT?

24:20.870 --> 24:24.249
OH, YEAH. BILLY
WAS NEVER SATISFIED.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.208
HE'D WIN THE BIGGEST
GAME OF HIS LIFE,

24:27.210 --> 24:29.793
HE WOULDN'T EVEN CELEBRATE
WITH HIS TEAMMATES.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.007
HE'D JUST WALK
OFF THE FIELD

24:32.010 --> 24:37.096
ALL BUSINESSLIKE,
ASKING, "WHO'S NEXT?"

24:41.230 --> 24:43.938
HEY, MAN, YOU
GOT A VISITOR.

24:46.270 --> 24:49.319
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO BED
WITH US STILL IN THE FIGHT,

24:49.320 --> 24:51.106
AND I WANTED
TO WISH YOU GOOD LUCK

24:51.110 --> 24:53.943
ON YOUR FIRST
PLAYOFF GAME.

24:56.030 --> 24:57.828
I'M SORRY
I CAN'T BE THERE.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.902
YEAH. WELL, I'M SORRY
I EMBARRASSED YOU.

25:00.910 --> 25:02.537
I GUESS THIS
ESSAY ASSIGNMENT

25:02.540 --> 25:03.780
JUST GOT
INTO MY HEAD.

25:03.790 --> 25:04.996
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.786
TEACHER WANTS ME
TO DIG DEEPER.

25:06.790 --> 25:08.167
I AIN'T
GOT THE ANSWERS.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.831
AND YOU THINK I DO.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.126
MAYBE.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.758
LOOK. I WATCHED
AN OLD VIDEO OF DAD,

25:13.760 --> 25:15.671
A HIGH-SCHOOL GAME
FROM SOUTH CRENSHAW.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.672
HE WAS AS GOOD AS ME,
MA, MAYBE BETTER.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.091
NOW HE'S YOUR
GREATEST INFLUENCE?

25:20.100 --> 25:21.841
NAH. I DIDN'T
SAY ALL THAT.

25:21.850 --> 25:24.342
HE DOESN'T
DESERVE THAT TITLE.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.148
WHEN HE LEFT, SPENCER,

25:26.150 --> 25:28.938
I HAD TO BE YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR FATHER,

25:28.940 --> 25:31.147
AND I DID IT BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU AND DILLON,

25:31.150 --> 25:32.936
BUT HIM LEAVING
FORCED ME TO STEP UP.

25:32.940 --> 25:36.945
WHY'D HE LEAVE US, MA?

25:36.950 --> 25:40.773
SPENCER, ALL YOU
NEED TO KNOW

25:40.780 --> 25:43.158
IS THAT IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.994
IT WAS ABOUT ME AND HIM.
AND BEFORE YOU ASK, NO.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.378
I DON'T HAVE TO RELIVE

25:49.380 --> 25:51.872
THE MOST PAINFUL
MOMENTS OF MY LIFE.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.871
I'M SORRY, BABY.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.508
I DON'T OWE YOU
MORE THAN THAT.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.420
COME HERE.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.487
COOP: WHAT, YOU THOUGHT
A CHANGE OF SCENERY

26:16.490 --> 26:17.901
WAS GONNA HELP YOU
WRITE THAT PAPER?

26:17.910 --> 26:19.446
YOU KNOW ME BETTER
THAN ANYONE, COOP.

26:19.450 --> 26:20.656
I FIGURED, BEING HERE
WITH YOU, I JUST--

26:20.660 --> 26:23.652
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP YOU,
SPENCE.

26:23.660 --> 26:27.244
YOU GOT TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION YOURSELF,

26:27.250 --> 26:30.493
BUT IT DEFINITELY AIN'T
NEON DEION SANDERS,

26:30.500 --> 26:32.036
AND IF YOU SAY,
"PRIME TIME,"

26:32.040 --> 26:33.917
I'M PUNCHING YOU
ALL IN YOUR FACE.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.706
HA!

26:35.710 --> 26:37.621
YOUR MOMS
WAS RIGHT, TOO.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.291
IT AIN'T
YOUR POPS, NEITHER.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.506
DUDE LEFT YOU.

26:40.510 --> 26:41.796
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHY HE LEFT, THOUGH.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.347
DO IT MATTER?

26:43.350 --> 26:45.341
HE GONE, AND LOOK
HOW GOOD YOU TURNED OUT.

26:45.350 --> 26:47.512
YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
LIFE WOULD BE

26:47.520 --> 26:49.090
TOTALLY DIFFERENT
IF HE WAS STILL AROUND.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.397
I WOULDN'T BE
WITH LEILA.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.107
YOU WOULDN'T BE
AT BEVERLY,

26:52.110 --> 26:54.568
PLAYER OF THE YEAR,
ALL THIS ATTENTION.

26:54.570 --> 26:57.358
LOOK. I KNOW
LOSING HIM WAS HARD,

26:57.360 --> 26:59.146
BUT LIFE TURNED OUT
GOOD FOR YOU.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.982
IT'S BEEN HARD
ON MY MOMS, THOUGH.

27:00.990 --> 27:02.651
YOU AIN'T GOT TO
WORRY ABOUT GRACE.

27:02.660 --> 27:04.867
SHE'S STRONG.

27:11.580 --> 27:12.706
MORNING.

27:12.710 --> 27:14.200
HEY.

27:17.050 --> 27:18.120
WHAT?

27:18.130 --> 27:21.293
NOTHING.
AM I BUGGING YOU?

27:21.300 --> 27:23.211
NO.

27:23.220 --> 27:26.520
MOM, I'M JUST FINISHING
GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.978
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

27:28.980 --> 27:31.130
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
M.I.A. LATELY

27:31.140 --> 27:33.393
AND I JUST PROMISED
TO PAY MORE ATTENTION,

27:33.400 --> 27:37.394
SO THIS IS ME PAYING
MORE ATTENTION.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.186
MOM, I'M NOT
USING OR ANYTHING.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.487
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

27:42.910 --> 27:44.617
MIDTERMS ARE
KICKING MY ASS.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.736
I'M SURE YOU'RE
DOING FINE,

27:46.740 --> 27:50.153
AND I'M EXCITED
TO HEAR MORE

27:50.160 --> 27:52.162
ABOUT YOUR
ESSAY ASSIGNMENT

27:52.170 --> 27:54.411
ON YOUR GREATEST
INFLUENCE.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.411
-MOM--
-I KNOW IT'S NOT ME.

27:56.420 --> 27:58.411
OLIVIA,
WHY SHOULD IT BE?

27:58.420 --> 27:59.751
I DIDN'T
PAY ATTENTION

27:59.760 --> 28:01.216
WHEN IT MATTERED
THE MOST,

28:01.220 --> 28:04.338
BUT I'M TRYING
TO CHANGE THAT,

28:04.340 --> 28:08.550
SO I'M GONNA
KEEP BUGGING YOU

28:08.560 --> 28:12.224
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE
THINGS RIGHT BETWEEN US.

28:21.070 --> 28:23.232
OLIVIA: DUDE, RELAX.
I'M SURE YOU'LL PLAY.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.311
JORDAN: YEAH. THAT'S NOT
THE POINT, LIVS, OK?

28:25.320 --> 28:26.981
I SHOULD BE STARTING.
I EARNED IT.

28:26.990 --> 28:28.981
IF DAD WAS GONNA
BENCH ME ALL ALONG,

28:28.990 --> 28:30.572
WHY DID HE HELP ME OUT?

28:30.580 --> 28:32.571
HELP YOU WITH WHAT?

28:32.580 --> 28:34.662
NOTHING. NOTHING.

28:34.670 --> 28:36.581
JORDAN...

28:36.590 --> 28:38.797
REMEMBER OUR NEW
BAKER FAMILY PACT?

28:38.800 --> 28:41.258
WE'RE ALL HERE TO
SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.625
OK. WHAT'S UP?

28:42.630 --> 28:44.371
LET'S JUST SAY I DIDN'T
EXACTLY GET LUCKY

28:44.380 --> 28:45.927
WITH THE DRUG TEST.

28:45.930 --> 28:47.250
YOU DIDN'T DO IT?
DAD HELPED YOU PASS?

28:47.260 --> 28:48.716
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, OK?

28:48.720 --> 28:50.131
HE'S STILL TREATING ME
LIKE A KID,

28:50.140 --> 28:51.676
THINKS I CAN'T
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.262
OR HE'S JUST
PROTECTING YOU.

28:53.270 --> 28:54.726
THAT'S THE THING, LIV.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.641
I DON'T NEED HIM TO
PROTECT ME ANYMORE.

28:56.650 --> 28:58.721
THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TELL HIM THAT.

29:03.030 --> 29:04.270
GOOD WORK, YOU TWO.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.059
ALL RIGHT. HAVE A GOOD
WEEKEND, EVERYBODY.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.232
WONDERFUL WORK, LEILA.

29:09.240 --> 29:14.280
YOUR MOTHER GAVE YOU
A GIFT. YOU SHOULD USE IT.

29:14.290 --> 29:17.373
SPENCER, YOU GOT
SOMETHING FOR ME?

29:17.380 --> 29:20.623
UM...

29:20.630 --> 29:22.917
YES, SIR.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.429
I LOOK FORWARD
TO READING IT.

29:27.430 --> 29:30.092
GOOD JOB,
JESSICA.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.926
SPENCER: HEY, LEILA...

29:33.930 --> 29:36.558
OH, HEY, UM, LISTEN,

29:36.560 --> 29:38.016
I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.647
WHEN I SAW YOU READING
THE NOTEBOOK,

29:39.650 --> 29:41.106
I GOT SCARED BECAUSE--

29:41.110 --> 29:42.896
THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.

29:42.900 --> 29:44.641
MR. VEGA WAS RIGHT.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.448
YOUR MOM
GAVE YOU A GIFT,

29:46.450 --> 29:49.488
AND SHE'D WANT YOU TO
KEEP GOING ON WITHOUT HER.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.952
I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE THE PRESSURE

29:55.960 --> 29:57.246
OF A PLAYOFF GAME, OK?

29:57.250 --> 29:58.240
WHOA. JORDAN--

29:58.250 --> 29:59.570
LET ME FINISH.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.162
YOU ALWAYS SHIELD ME
FROM THE TRUTH

30:01.170 --> 30:03.161
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
THINK I CAN TAKE IT.

30:03.170 --> 30:05.081
I DON'T NEED YOU TO
PROTECT ME ANYMORE, OK?

30:05.090 --> 30:08.173
I JUST NEED YOU TO
TREAT ME LIKE A MAN.

30:08.180 --> 30:11.172
UH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:11.180 --> 30:14.673
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE READY.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.682
I NEED TO SEE IT.

30:18.650 --> 30:23.895
SPENCER: DOWN! SET!
BLUE 8! BLUE 8!

30:23.900 --> 30:26.187
ANNOUNCER: JAMES FAKES THE
HANDOFF AND GOES UP THE MIDDLE.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.897

BILLY: GOOD.
THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO...

30:29.410 --> 30:32.198
HE'S AT THE 35,
THE 30, THE 25.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.500
HE'S GONNA GO ALL THE WAY.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.494
TOUCHDOWN, SPENCER JAMES,

30:39.500 --> 30:43.050
WITH AN AMAZING, 40-YARD DASH

30:46.050 --> 30:49.213
BILLY: NOW IS THE TIME
TO DIG IN, Y'ALL.

30:49.220 --> 30:52.429
DO NOT FORGET
WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE,

30:52.430 --> 30:55.639
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING ALL YEAR FOR,

30:55.640 --> 30:59.679
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
SWEATING ALL YEAR FOR.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.340
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS...

31:07.740 --> 31:09.731
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.
BRING IT IN.

31:09.740 --> 31:11.026
PLAYER: ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. LET'S
BREAK IT DOWN. LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.

31:11.030 --> 31:13.271
-WIN!
-LET'S GO, BOYS!

31:13.280 --> 31:16.693
GO GET THEM, BOYS.
NICE JOB.

31:16.700 --> 31:20.864
SPENCE. SPENCE. HEY.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.201
WHO'S THAT GUY?

31:27.880 --> 31:30.212
THAT'S MY DAD.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.678
SPENCER: BLUE 8!

31:35.680 --> 31:37.717
BLUE 8! SET! GO!

31:42.810 --> 31:44.608

BEVERLY TO THE BRINK.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.562
WITH 1:38 LEFT ON THE CLOCK,

31:50.570 --> 31:54.689
THE EAGLES HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
OR THEIR SEASON WILL BE OVER.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.158
SPENCER: BLUE 8! SET!

31:57.160 --> 31:59.652
ANNOUNCER:
OH, IT'S A MUFFED SNAP,

31:59.660 --> 32:01.822
BUT ADAMS IS THERE
TO JUMP ON IT.

32:01.830 --> 32:06.085
JAMES NOW SUDDENLY LOOKING
COMPLETELY OUT OF SYNC.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.740
BILLY: WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON WITH SPENCER TODAY?

32:07.750 --> 32:09.752
-HIS DAD'S HERE.
-WHAT?

32:17.430 --> 32:18.920
-DAD. DAD!
-YEAH?

32:18.930 --> 32:20.136
HEY, WE GOT
A GAME TO WIN.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.097
-YEAH.
-SPENCER'S OUT OF IT, OK?

32:22.100 --> 32:24.398
PUT ME IN.
I CAN DO THIS.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.028
ALL RIGHT.
GET OUT THERE.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.737
GO ON. TAKE 'EM HOME.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.855
ANNOUNCER: AND YOUNG BAKER

32:31.860 --> 32:34.101

32:34.110 --> 32:36.863
WHAT'S UP? YOU BOYS MISS ME?
ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS.

32:36.870 --> 32:39.032
GUN TRAY, LEFT,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.496

32:40.500 --> 32:42.116
HEY, SPENCE,
I NEED YOU, OK?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.667
YOUR DAD'S TAKEN
ENOUGH FROM YOU.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.287
DON'T LET HIM TAKE
THIS GAME, TOO.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.545
WHITE 65! SET!

32:53.550 --> 32:55.040
ANNOUNCER:
YOUNG BAKER DROPS BACK.

32:55.050 --> 32:57.382
AND HE'S GOT ADAMS

32:57.390 --> 33:01.509
OH, AND MITCHELL

33:01.520 --> 33:04.933
DREW MITCHELL CONTINUES
HIS SECOND-HALF DOMINATION,

33:04.940 --> 33:07.807
AND BEVERLY WITH A TIMEOUT.

33:12.570 --> 33:13.856
ANNOUNCER:
FOURTH DOWN AND 12

33:13.860 --> 33:15.692
WITH JUST 46 SECONDS LEFT

33:15.700 --> 33:17.862
IF BAKER CAN'T FIND A WAY
TO MOVE THE BALL HERE,

33:17.870 --> 33:21.363
BEVERLY'S SEASON IS OVER.

33:21.370 --> 33:23.998
BAKER GETTING THE SNAP.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.741
AND HE LETS IT RIP...

33:25.750 --> 33:27.570
MITCHELL:
GAME OVER, BAKER.

33:27.580 --> 33:29.662
ANNOUNCER: AND ADAMS

33:29.670 --> 33:30.740
GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS,

33:30.750 --> 33:32.206
YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

33:32.210 --> 33:34.588
ANNOUNCER: FIRST DOWN AND 10
ON THE 45 YARD LINE.

33:34.590 --> 33:36.501
BAKER KNEW HE WAS GOING TO
GET CLOBBERED ON THAT,

33:36.510 --> 33:41.175
BUT HE STOOD IN THERE AND TOOK
THE PUNISHMENT LIKE A MAN.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.636
MAN: AND THE CROWD

33:42.640 --> 33:44.347
ANNOUNCER: 33 SECONDS

BEVERLY HAS MAYBE
ONE OR TWO PLAYS LEFT

33:48.860 --> 33:51.568
BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT
ON THIS GAME AND THEIR SEASON.

33:51.570 --> 33:55.734
HERE'S THE SNAP.
BAKER DROPPING BACK.

33:55.740 --> 33:58.107
HE LETS IT FLY.

33:58.110 --> 34:00.989
CAUGHT BY SPENCER JAMES,

34:00.990 --> 34:03.402
AND HE GETS OUT OF BOUNDS,
STOPPING THE CLOCK

34:03.410 --> 34:05.708
WITH 11 SECONDS LEFT.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.533
THAT LEAVES TIME
FOR ONE FINAL PLAY.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.589
WITH THE SEASON ON THE LINE,
BEVERLY HAS TO SCORE HERE,

34:12.590 --> 34:14.706

BAKER TAKES THE SNAP,
STEPS INTO THE POCKET.

34:18.429 --> 34:21.138
MAN: GETTIN' WILD WITH

34:25.639 --> 34:29.929
JORDAN BAKER WITH A DRAMATIC,
COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN.

34:29.940 --> 34:34.639
BEVERLY ADVANCES,
ENDING LOGAN'S SEASON.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.822
YOU DID IT,
JORDAN.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.242
WHO'S NEXT?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.241
MAN: ...WITH THE WOMEN,
MISTER SELLS

34:47.250 --> 34:49.708
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD...

35:01.760 --> 35:04.001
MR. VEGA: SPENCER,

35:04.010 --> 35:07.014
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE WIN.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.762
THANKS.
NOT MY BEST GAME.

35:09.770 --> 35:11.898
I WANTED TO RETURN
YOUR ESSAY.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.186
AGAIN?

35:13.190 --> 35:15.773
HEH! THIS TIME
WITH A GRADE.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.680
NOW, THAT'S
THE SPENCER JAMES

35:17.690 --> 35:19.818
THAT I SAW GLIMPSES
OF ALL YEAR.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.902
YOU'RE GOOD
OUT ON THAT FIELD,

35:21.910 --> 35:24.618
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE BEST AT.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.908
THIS COULD BE
WHERE YOUR FUTURE LIES

35:27.910 --> 35:30.288
BEYOND FOOTBALL.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.918
SEE YOU MONDAY.

35:48.140 --> 35:49.767
WILLY:
NEVER A DOUBT, HUH?

35:49.770 --> 35:51.727
ALL JORDAN EVER NEEDED
WAS SOMEONE

35:51.730 --> 35:53.641
WHO BELIEVED
HE COULD DELIVER,

35:53.650 --> 35:55.357
AND HE NEEDED TO SEE
YOU GET RATTLED

35:55.360 --> 35:57.727
JUST LIKE THE REST
OF US, BILLY.

35:57.730 --> 36:00.062
COREY JAMES SHOWED UP
AT THE GAME TONIGHT,

36:00.070 --> 36:02.562
BUT YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY KNEW THAT.

36:02.570 --> 36:04.368
SPENCER TOLD ME
AT THE BARBECUE

36:04.370 --> 36:06.520
THAT COREY NEVER
SAW HIM PLAY.

36:06.530 --> 36:08.942
I JUST THOUGHT
COREY SHOULD KNOW

36:08.950 --> 36:11.863
THAT HIS SON WANTED
HIM TO BE HERE.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.828
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

36:14.830 --> 36:18.289
SURE I DO.

36:18.300 --> 36:22.464
I GAVE MY GRANDSON
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE.

36:33.730 --> 36:35.016
HEY...

36:36.730 --> 36:38.971
ALL RIGHT?

36:38.980 --> 36:41.733
I JUST WANT TO
GET BACK HOME.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.324
OH, SPENCE,
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

36:47.330 --> 36:50.197
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH
YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.113
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT,
NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.748
THAT'S ON YOU.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.741
DID YOU SEE HIM?

36:57.750 --> 36:59.741
UH, YES.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.912
WHAT WAS HE
DOING HERE?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.002
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
HE JUST SHOWS UP?

37:04.010 --> 37:05.796
HE JUST WANTED
TO SEE YOU PLAY.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.791
NOW?

37:07.800 --> 37:11.759
I WAS FINALLY MAKING
PEACE WITH IT ALL, MAN.

37:11.770 --> 37:14.762
I PUT HIS GHOST TO REST.

37:14.770 --> 37:17.228
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.731
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
WHO IS MY GREATEST INFLUENCE?

37:28.740 --> 37:33.075
A SIMPLE QUESTION, BUT
THE ANSWER'S MORE COMPLICATED...

37:33.080 --> 37:34.957
WOMAN: THOUGHT
I FOUND A WAY...

37:34.960 --> 37:37.167
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: BECAUSE
WE'RE ALL STILL EVOLVING EVERY DAY,

37:37.170 --> 37:40.458
SO THE ANSWER CAN CHANGE
IN AN INSTANT.

37:40.460 --> 37:43.259
WOMAN: BUT YOU
NEVER GO AWAY

37:43.260 --> 37:45.467
SO I GUESS...

37:45.470 --> 37:48.041
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: SOMEONE
COMES INTO YOUR LIFE UNEXPECTEDLY,

37:48.050 --> 37:53.477
AND, SUDDENLY, YOU SEE THE WORLD
THROUGH A NEW LENS.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.268
THAT PERSON TEACHES YOU
IT'S OK TO LET PEOPLE IN,

37:56.270 --> 37:57.840
TO START OVER.

37:57.850 --> 38:01.070
MAN: EVEN IF IT TAKES
ALL NIGHT

38:01.070 --> 38:04.688
OR A HUNDRED YEARS

38:04.690 --> 38:08.479
NEED A PLACE TO HIDE...

38:08.490 --> 38:09.946
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
YOU CAN GO YOUR WHOLE LIFE

38:09.950 --> 38:12.078
THINKING YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.287
THEN ONE DAY, YOU REALIZE
THE GREATEST INFLUENCE

38:14.290 --> 38:16.611
IN YOUR LIFE
MIGHT BE SOMEONE ELSE.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.452
READY TO GET
TO WORK?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.206
READY.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.463
WOMAN: ISN'T IT LOVELY

38:25.470 --> 38:27.086
ALL ALONE?

38:27.090 --> 38:28.797
HEART MADE OF GLASS

38:28.800 --> 38:31.212
MY MIND OF STONE

38:31.220 --> 38:34.099
MAN AND WOMAN:
TEAR ME TO PIECES

38:34.100 --> 38:35.170
SKIN TO BONE...

38:35.180 --> 38:38.309
"MY GREATEST
INFLUENCE IS..."

38:38.310 --> 38:40.017
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
SOMETIMES THE ANSWER

38:40.020 --> 38:43.229
ISN'T WHO INFLUENCED YOU
THE MOST BUT WHAT.

38:43.230 --> 38:47.110
THE LITTLE
WHITE PILL.

38:47.110 --> 38:49.568
DRUGS NEARLY
RUINED MY LIFE,

38:49.570 --> 38:52.119
BUT I CAME OUT
ON THE OTHER SIDE

38:52.120 --> 38:54.532
A BETTER PERSON.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.861
AND IF I'D NAMED
A PERSON

38:56.870 --> 38:59.862
WHO INFLUENCED
ME THE MOST,

38:59.870 --> 39:02.339
OF COURSE
IT WOULD BE YOU.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.377
MAN AND WOMAN:
OH, I HOPE SOMEDAY

39:05.380 --> 39:11.581
I'll MAKE IT OUT OF HERE

39:11.590 --> 39:13.342
EVEN IF IT...

39:13.350 --> 39:15.921
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: PEOPLE
COME AND GO FROM OUR LIVES,

39:15.930 --> 39:21.471
BUT ONLY A HANDFUL OF THEM TRULY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR FUTURE.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.517
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CHOOSE
ONE PERSON

39:23.520 --> 39:25.682
WHO INFLUENCED MY LIFE THE MOST.

39:25.690 --> 39:28.352
IT'S WHAT THEY ALL TAUGHT ME
THAT MATTERS,

39:28.360 --> 39:30.818
THINGS LIKE LOYALTY.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.901
SO HOW LONG
YOU KNOWN TYRONE?

39:35.910 --> 39:37.901
A MINUTE.

39:37.910 --> 39:39.617
MAN, A MINUTE
COULD BE 10 YEARS,

39:39.620 --> 39:41.782
OR IT COULD LITERALLY
MEAN A MINUTE.

39:46.840 --> 39:50.583
SO WHAT'D YOU
DO IN PRISON?

39:50.590 --> 39:53.082
READ BOOKS.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.752
WHAT'D YOU READ?

39:55.760 --> 39:57.171
GREEK MYTHOLOGY.

39:57.180 --> 39:59.979
SERIOUSLY? LIKE WHAT?

39:59.980 --> 40:01.937
TROJAN WAR WAS COOL.

40:01.940 --> 40:03.556
THEY BUILD A WOODEN
HORSE SO THEY CAN

40:03.560 --> 40:05.517
TAKE THEM DOWN
FROM THE INSIDE.

40:08.610 --> 40:11.193
I NEVER READ THAT,
BUT THE GREEKS

40:11.200 --> 40:13.237
SOUND LIKE
THEY WERE SMART.

40:13.240 --> 40:16.733
MAN AND WOMAN:
BUT I KNOW SOMEDAY

40:16.740 --> 40:22.418
I'll MAKE IT OUT OF HERE

40:22.420 --> 40:23.956
EVEN IF IT

40:23.960 --> 40:25.621
TAKES ALL NIGHT...

40:25.630 --> 40:28.543
YO, COOP...

40:28.550 --> 40:30.461
THE GREEKS...

40:30.470 --> 40:34.213
THEY WEREN'T AS SMART AS
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE.

40:34.220 --> 40:39.260
MAN AND WOMAN: BUT
I CAN'T FIND ONE NEAR

40:39.270 --> 40:41.671
WANNA FEEL ALIVE

40:41.680 --> 40:46.436
OUTSIDE
I CAN'T FIGHT MY FEAR...

40:46.440 --> 40:50.650
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: SO WHO
IS MY GREATEST INFLUENCE?

40:50.650 --> 40:52.948
IF I HAVE TO GIVE AN ANSWER,

40:52.950 --> 40:57.023
IT HAS TO BE
MY FATHER'S ABSENCE.

40:57.030 --> 41:00.819
HIM LEAVING ME LEFT A VOID
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE FILLED.

41:00.830 --> 41:05.996
IF HE HADN'T LEFT, I WOULDN'T BE
THE PERSON I AM TODAY.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.459
-COREY.
-GRACE.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.451
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

41:11.460 --> 41:13.087
IT USED TO BE
MY HOUSE.

41:13.090 --> 41:15.548
NOT ANYMORE.

41:15.550 --> 41:17.962
I KNOW,
AND DON'T WORRY.

41:17.970 --> 41:21.600
I'M NOT HERE
TO BLOW UP YOUR WORLD.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.683
I WON'T TELL
SPENCER THE TRUTH.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.398
I JUST WANT
TO BE IN HIS LIFE.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.607
IT'S TIME.

41:35.030 --> 41:36.907
SON.

41:36.910 --> 41:41.689
MAN AND WOMAN:
HELLO, WELCOME HOME

42:06.730 --> 42:08.141
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
