WEBVTT

00:02.364 --> 00:04.330
Ooh, it's freezing
out here.

00:04.399 --> 00:06.666
Would you like me to...
heat things up?

00:06.735 --> 00:09.903
No, I want to get in the hot tub
before I lose a toe.

00:10.839 --> 00:13.139
Oh. That is bright!

00:13.208 --> 00:15.608
Yeah, a new neighbor
put in floodlights.

00:15.677 --> 00:17.077
Huh.

00:17.145 --> 00:18.678
So, shall we?

00:18.747 --> 00:20.580
No. I don't want

00:20.649 --> 00:22.982
to take my robe off
under a spotlight.

00:23.051 --> 00:25.485
This is a candle body.

00:25.554 --> 00:26.820
Howdy, neighbors!

00:26.888 --> 00:29.122
We haven't met
yet. I'm Andy.

00:29.191 --> 00:31.157
Oh. Hello.
Nice to meet you.

00:31.226 --> 00:35.228
You know, your new balcony kind
of looks right over our fence.

00:35.297 --> 00:38.531
You might want to put up some
trees. We can see everything.

00:38.600 --> 00:42.535
You <i>can,</i> but it's okay
if you don't.

00:44.206 --> 00:46.372
So, can you turn
your lights off?

00:46.441 --> 00:47.807
Sorry, they're
motion-sensored.

00:47.876 --> 00:50.810
They'll go off in a minute.
Just try to stay still.

00:52.214 --> 00:54.581
What are we gonna
do about this?

00:54.649 --> 00:56.883
I say we wait until
his lights go off,

00:56.952 --> 01:00.987
and then I make hot,
motionless love to you.

01:03.658 --> 01:06.062
Don't move.
It's go time.

And his new balcony looks
right down on our hot tub,

01:37.568 --> 01:39.868
which meant we
couldn't do anything.

01:39.937 --> 01:43.772
So you gave your kids
Benadryl for nothing?

01:45.476 --> 01:48.977
Why do I share with you?
You're such a yenta.

01:49.046 --> 01:50.345
Are we done talking about

01:50.414 --> 01:52.080
Howard's failed
conjugal relations?

01:52.149 --> 01:54.416
I have an actual
Nobel Prize crisis to deal with.

01:54.518 --> 01:56.730
Has anything changed since the
last time you talked about it?

01:56.754 --> 01:57.217
No.

01:57.241 --> 01:58.154
Is there anything
you can do about it?

01:58.155 --> 01:58.761
No.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.914
Then shut up
or go wait in the car!

02:01.492 --> 02:02.557
Excuse me.

02:02.626 --> 02:04.126
Remember you all came here

02:04.194 --> 02:06.194
to check out
my cool new laser?

02:06.263 --> 02:08.997
Oh, right. I'm gonna go
wait in the car.

02:09.066 --> 02:12.200
The best part is that
it's europium-based, so...

02:12.269 --> 02:13.747
And then Andy said
if we want privacy,

02:13.771 --> 02:16.271
we should plant
some trees.

02:16.340 --> 02:19.274
The only way I know how to
do that is to give a dollar

02:19.343 --> 02:21.943
and tree shows
up in Israel.

02:22.012 --> 02:25.013
Okay. Anyway, so because
it's europium-based...

02:25.082 --> 02:27.349
Hey. I need some help
with a meteorite I found.

02:27.418 --> 02:28.917
Ah. I'd be happy to.

02:28.986 --> 02:30.218
Oh, no, I meant Raj.

02:30.287 --> 02:32.287
I really need an astrophysicist.

02:32.356 --> 02:33.288
Wow.

02:33.357 --> 02:35.123
This is exactly like
a dream I had.

02:35.192 --> 02:38.760
Except in the dream,
you're Gal Gadot.

02:38.829 --> 02:43.432
I don't really have dreams,
when I sleep or in life.

02:45.035 --> 02:46.435
Anyway...

02:46.503 --> 02:48.503
I X-rayed this meteorite,
and it looks like there's

02:48.539 --> 02:50.505
some sort of organic signature
inside of it,

02:50.574 --> 02:52.372
but I could really use
another opinion.

02:52.396 --> 02:53.517
Well, great.
Let's go check it out.

02:53.518 --> 02:54.743
Cool.

02:54.812 --> 02:56.478
I'm gonna stay here
and show Howard...

02:56.547 --> 02:58.313
I want to see it!

02:58.382 --> 03:02.317
Okay. Well, thanks for
stopping by.

03:06.090 --> 03:08.590
Screw them. That's cool.

03:10.027 --> 03:12.561
Hey, I'm not sure
we're in the right line.

03:12.629 --> 03:14.763
- Is this for the city zoning office?
- Yes, it is.

03:14.832 --> 03:17.499
Or, as we call it here,
"the zone zone."

03:20.237 --> 03:22.637
No, we don't.

03:22.706 --> 03:24.272
That's Linda.

03:24.341 --> 03:27.709
Ignore her.
She's going through the change.

03:27.778 --> 03:29.911
Now, how can I help you?

03:29.980 --> 03:31.324
Our neighbor built
a balcony that looks

03:31.348 --> 03:33.059
right into our backyard,
and we're trying to see

03:33.083 --> 03:34.594
if there's anything
we can do about it.

03:34.618 --> 03:36.551
Well, you have come
to the right place.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.898
You know, a lot of people handle
this type of thing online,

03:38.922 --> 03:41.423
but I always say
nothing beats the human touch.

03:41.492 --> 03:42.692
Oh, but don't worry.

03:42.726 --> 03:44.526
I'm not gonna
actually touch you.

03:44.595 --> 03:48.130
We had quite the informative
meeting on that.

03:48.198 --> 03:51.066
We just want a little
privacy in our backyard.

03:51.135 --> 03:53.902
You know, for...

03:55.372 --> 03:58.206
Maybe we should've
done this online.

03:58.275 --> 04:00.909
No, no, no, no.
The zone zone is a safe zone.

04:00.978 --> 04:04.179
Stop saying "zone zone"!

04:04.248 --> 04:06.214
So, is there anything we can do?

04:06.283 --> 04:09.117
Absolutely. Do you know if they
have permits for the balcony?

04:09.186 --> 04:11.186
Oh, no. We were hoping
you could check.

04:11.255 --> 04:13.233
I certainly can. I just
need you to fill out a form,

04:13.257 --> 04:15.423
and we have them available
in Armenian, Chinese,

04:15.492 --> 04:19.528
Cambodian, English, Farsi,
Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese.

04:20.930 --> 04:23.398
Well, English, obviously.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.267
Well, we're not
allowed to presume.

04:25.335 --> 04:28.236
That was a whole other meeting.

04:28.305 --> 04:30.772
So we just fill out
the form and that's it?

04:30.841 --> 04:33.809
Oh, no. No, you need to
fill it out, and then you need

04:33.877 --> 04:36.244
to bring it down to
the Office of Code Compliance.

04:36.313 --> 04:38.880
Now, if your neighbors don't
have a permit, you can file

04:38.949 --> 04:41.016
an official complaint,
but if they do have a permit,

04:41.084 --> 04:43.363
then you have to make the case
that the balcony constitutes

04:43.387 --> 04:46.254
a nuisance, an encumbrance
or an encroachment,

04:46.323 --> 04:47.656
and you have to decide which,

04:47.724 --> 04:49.791
because they are three
totally separate forms.

04:49.860 --> 04:53.695
This is starting to seem like
more trouble than it's worth.

04:53.764 --> 04:55.463
I know, right?

05:00.170 --> 05:02.237
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:02.306 --> 05:05.807
Great, 'cause you just bought
that whole row of Batmans.

05:05.876 --> 05:07.509
Sorry, I...

05:10.814 --> 05:13.315
And now you bought Aquaman.
Good choice.

05:14.685 --> 05:15.984
If you want cold medicine,

05:16.053 --> 05:17.986
Stuart has the entire run
of DayQuils,

05:18.055 --> 05:21.323
including the rare
"DayQuilt" misprint from 1996.

05:22.626 --> 05:25.193
What can I say?
I'm a collector.

05:25.262 --> 05:27.829
Thanks, but I'm fine.
I think it's just allergies.

05:27.898 --> 05:28.942
- Hi, guys. - Hey.
- Hey.

05:28.966 --> 05:30.198
Oh, heads up.

05:30.267 --> 05:32.367
If that Aquaman feels wet,
it's not a gimmick.

05:32.436 --> 05:34.002
Leonard sneezed on it.

05:35.892 --> 05:37.578
- You sick?
- Uh, it's just allergies.

05:37.579 --> 05:38.707
Oh. So, check it out.

05:38.775 --> 05:41.243
This meteorite that Bert found
is really cool.

05:41.311 --> 05:43.245
We did a spectrographic
analysis, and there's...

05:43.313 --> 05:45.480
there's definitely something
going on inside.

05:45.549 --> 05:47.415
Well, y, i-if you want,

05:47.484 --> 05:49.684
we could use my new laser
to cut it open.

05:49.753 --> 05:51.953
Well, thanks, but Bert's
got this water-cooled,

05:52.022 --> 05:53.488
diamond-bladed saw.

05:53.557 --> 05:56.558
Well, sure, but with my laser,
you'd get a thinner slice,

05:56.627 --> 05:58.573
which would make for
a better sample.

05:58.597 --> 05:59.295
Whoa, whoa.

05:59.296 --> 06:02.097
You're not gonna cut
open a meteor, are you?

06:03.500 --> 06:06.034
Have you not learned anything
from comic books?

06:07.304 --> 06:10.739
Space viruses?
Pod people?

06:10.807 --> 06:13.208
I sell nothing
but warnings.

06:14.478 --> 06:15.877
C-Calm down, Stuart.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.579
You're being a little crazy.

06:17.648 --> 06:19.314
Oh, is he?
Is he being crazy?

06:19.383 --> 06:22.684
Or is he the only one around
here who's making any sense?

06:24.254 --> 06:28.089
It's nice they
found each other.

06:28.158 --> 06:30.992
Yeah. Uh, so, anyway,
you want to use my laser?

06:31.061 --> 06:32.694
Eh, sorry.
It's kind of Bert's thing,

06:32.763 --> 06:34.663
and he wants to do it
his way, so...

06:34.731 --> 06:35.931
Okay.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.899
Yeah, that's cool.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.468
Just seems dumb
to not use the laser.

06:40.537 --> 06:44.105
Not as dumb as
unleashing a plague on mankind,

06:44.174 --> 06:46.441
but, hey, what do we know?

06:46.510 --> 06:48.777
Literally nothing.

06:51.982 --> 06:55.450
We spent half the day down
at the city planning office,

06:55.519 --> 06:56.651
and didn't solve a thing.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.286
Now we have to go
back tomorrow.

06:58.355 --> 07:01.389
The planning office?
You lucky ducks.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.558
Yeah, this one made
me go for ice cream

07:03.627 --> 07:05.293
and talk about her day.

07:05.362 --> 07:07.963
Spoiler alert:
it was fine.

07:09.533 --> 07:12.500
It <i>wasn't</i> fine.
I got trapped in an elevator.

07:12.569 --> 07:14.536
I may have missed a few details.

07:14.604 --> 07:17.772
The bottom of my cone
was drippy.

07:17.841 --> 07:21.185
So now we have to download
all these forms and fill them out.

07:21.186 --> 07:21.476
We get it.

07:21.545 --> 07:24.779
Your life is great.
Stop rubbing it in.

07:24.848 --> 07:26.848
Yeah, quit it.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.150
Is one of the forms

07:29.219 --> 07:30.952
the 599B/C?

07:31.021 --> 07:33.588
Because, if so, it has
a doozy of a typo.

07:33.657 --> 07:34.889
I don't know.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.838
All right, well, I don't
want to spoil anything,

07:36.893 --> 07:40.195
but you might want to start
practicing your "siglature."

07:42.566 --> 07:44.444
Sheldon, if you like this
stuff, why don't you come

07:44.468 --> 07:46.167
and do it with us?
- Or instead of us?

07:46.236 --> 07:47.769
Do you mean it?

07:47.838 --> 07:50.739
No, no, wait, it's too late.
You can't take it back. Yes.

07:52.109 --> 07:53.386
Well, Amy,
looks like the elevator

07:53.410 --> 07:55.310
might have been
the high point of your day.

07:56.313 --> 07:58.079
Hey, where's Raj?

07:58.148 --> 07:59.481
Uh, he's working with Bert.

07:59.549 --> 08:01.916
They're probably cutting
their stupid meteorite open

08:01.985 --> 08:04.052
with their stupid
diamond saw.

08:05.589 --> 08:06.888
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

08:06.957 --> 08:08.089
I'm just a little run-down.

08:08.158 --> 08:09.424
It might be a head cold.

08:12.396 --> 08:14.229
Purell.

08:15.265 --> 08:16.598
Purell.

08:17.634 --> 08:19.434
Purell.

08:19.503 --> 08:21.536
Purell.

08:23.607 --> 08:25.573
Can I top anybody off?

08:28.879 --> 08:30.812
It's just so frustrating.

08:30.881 --> 08:33.448
I-I know my laser would be
way more efficient.

08:33.517 --> 08:36.583
They're gonna lose so much
meteorite due to kerf loss.

08:36.653 --> 08:41.423
Mm. I'm sorry your friends won't
let you play kerf with them.

08:41.491 --> 08:44.058
Don't make it sound childish.

08:44.126 --> 08:46.161
It's the scientific word
for dust.

08:46.229 --> 08:48.063
What was wrong with "dust"?

08:49.533 --> 08:52.333
Are you sure you're
not just a little jealous?

08:52.402 --> 08:55.670
No. It's just, my way is better,
but they won't even consider it.

08:55.739 --> 08:57.583
Oh, well, it's their loss.
Look, why don't you go to bed.

08:57.607 --> 08:58.789
I'll run out and get
you some medicine.

08:58.813 --> 08:59.442
Ah, it's okay.

08:59.443 --> 09:02.143
Stuart gave me some when
I was at the comic book store.

09:02.212 --> 09:05.647
Really? You're taking medicine
from Stuart?

09:05.715 --> 09:08.616
Doesn't he need,
like, all of it?

09:08.685 --> 09:10.285
Mm, he's got plenty.

09:10.353 --> 09:13.688
His pill caddy is,
like, this big.

09:13.757 --> 09:15.268
All right, well,
why don't you go to bed.

09:15.292 --> 09:16.591
I'll sleep out here
on the couch.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.237
No, no, no, you take the bed.
I'll stay out here.

09:18.261 --> 09:20.195
Even better.
Sweet dreams, snot bag.

09:25.469 --> 09:27.235
See what
I'm talking about?

09:27.304 --> 09:28.770
Oh, yes.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.872
Oh, that is
textbook encroachment.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.775
And I know
because I have the textbook.

09:33.844 --> 09:36.878
First edition.

09:36.947 --> 09:38.880
Watch what happens
when you move.

09:39.983 --> 09:41.082
Oh!

09:41.151 --> 09:43.218
Oh, boy, you weren't kidding.

09:43.286 --> 09:46.621
Oh, those are 10,000
lumens if they're a lumen.

09:46.690 --> 09:48.256
Well, you know
what they say:

09:48.325 --> 09:51.926
when life give you lumens,
make lumen-Ade.

09:51.995 --> 09:53.528
Was that a joke?

09:53.597 --> 09:55.296
Yes.

09:55.365 --> 09:58.600
Based on the premise that
"lumen" sounds like "lemon"?

09:58.668 --> 10:01.803
Yes.

10:01.872 --> 10:03.271
That's hilarious.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.975
Okay, what is the setback
on property lines

10:07.043 --> 10:08.243
in this neighborhood?

10:08.311 --> 10:09.744
Oh, I don't know.

10:09.813 --> 10:12.380
It must be on the permit
from when you built your deck.

10:12.449 --> 10:13.915
Uh, yeah,
my dad built this.

10:13.984 --> 10:15.384
We didn't do
the whole permit thing.

10:18.121 --> 10:19.654
Here we go.

10:19.723 --> 10:21.489
Are you saying

10:21.558 --> 10:24.192
I'm standing
on an unpermitted deck?

10:24.261 --> 10:27.061
It's been here for years,
Sheldon. It's fine.

10:27.130 --> 10:28.563
How did the inspector
not flag this

10:28.632 --> 10:30.343
when he came to check out
your bathroom renovation?

10:30.367 --> 10:31.199
Uh...

10:34.271 --> 10:36.137
Are you telling me
that I have showered

10:36.206 --> 10:37.839
in an uninspected bathroom?

10:37.908 --> 10:39.574
You showered
in our house?

10:39.643 --> 10:42.043
You made me hold your children.
What did you expect me to do?

10:44.000 --> 10:50.074

10:52.284 --> 10:55.252
You think
you know people.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.621
You <i>do</i> know
them, Sheldon.

10:57.689 --> 11:00.056
Yeah, but-but do we?
Do we <i>really</i> know them?

11:01.968 --> 11:03.026
Yes!

11:04.156 --> 11:05.627
They're rule breakers, Amy.

11:05.628 --> 11:07.394
And you know what we do
with rule breakers?

11:07.463 --> 11:09.263
Complain about them
to our spouse

11:09.332 --> 11:11.665
until she's ready to drive
into oncoming traffic?

11:12.145 --> 11:14.234
You can't cross
a double yellow line.

11:14.303 --> 11:16.136
What is this, the Purge?

11:16.205 --> 11:18.339
So, I guess
you're not gonna help them?

11:18.407 --> 11:19.506
Oh, I'm gonna help them--

11:19.575 --> 11:22.476
help them get on the right side
of Johnny Law.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.211
Oh, you can't
turn them in.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.746
The city's gonna
make them rip out

11:25.815 --> 11:27.681
all the work they've
done and do it over.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.416
It would be the end
of your friendship.

11:29.485 --> 11:31.418
What choice do I have?
These are the rules.

11:31.487 --> 11:33.487
Sheldon, I am begging you.
Please, don't do this.

11:33.556 --> 11:37.191
You know who doesn't get permits
for their decks? Animals.

11:37.259 --> 11:39.793
Animals don't have decks.

11:39.862 --> 11:42.696
Oh, really? I have
one word for you: beavers.

11:48.904 --> 11:50.838
Bert?

11:50.906 --> 11:53.207
Raj?

11:53.275 --> 11:55.209
Huh.

11:59.048 --> 12:00.448
Can't believe
they're gonna cut that

12:00.516 --> 12:03.450
with this punk-ass diamond saw.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.891
Geez.

12:22.905 --> 12:24.505
Oh, hey, look.

12:24.573 --> 12:27.241
"Siglature."

12:29.512 --> 12:30.744
- Next!
- Hello.

12:30.813 --> 12:34.448
Hi! Welcome to the zone zone.

12:34.517 --> 12:36.450
Oh, that's funny!

12:36.519 --> 12:39.887
Hey, I also have
a joke for you.

12:39.955 --> 12:41.955
Lumen-Ade.

12:43.659 --> 12:45.692
Maybe I told it wrong.

12:45.761 --> 12:47.294
Well, how can I help you?

12:47.363 --> 12:49.797
If I know someone in violation
of the building code,

12:49.865 --> 12:51.365
should I turn them in?

12:51.434 --> 12:52.766
Interesting question.

12:52.835 --> 12:54.835
Yeah, I know. Because,
on the one hand,

12:54.904 --> 12:57.304
Confucius says we owe
a greater responsibility

12:57.373 --> 13:00.574
to people we're close with
rather than to society at large.

13:00.643 --> 13:02.576
But, on the other hand,
Socrates says that

13:02.645 --> 13:05.779
we're obligated to obey
all laws, even unjust ones.

13:05.848 --> 13:07.626
And then, furthermore,
if we're entertaining rules

13:07.650 --> 13:09.316
about when it's okay
to break the rules,

13:09.385 --> 13:11.151
I should--
where does it end?

13:11.220 --> 13:14.421
Well, for me, it ends at 5:00.

13:16.292 --> 13:18.892
Well, I just-- I don't
know what to do.

13:18.961 --> 13:20.705
All I can tell you
is that the building codes

13:20.729 --> 13:22.162
are there for everyone's safety.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.965
Oh, so you're saying I have
no choice but to turn them in.

13:25.034 --> 13:27.468
I did not say that.

13:27.536 --> 13:28.936
But would you?

13:29.004 --> 13:32.739
And remember that I laughed
at your "zone zone" joke.

13:32.808 --> 13:34.741
It's not even a joke!

13:34.810 --> 13:36.743
Oh, is that Linda back there?

13:36.812 --> 13:38.278
- Yeah.
- Aw.

13:38.347 --> 13:40.347
How are her hot
flashes? Any better?

13:44.086 --> 13:45.686
Leonard,
what are you doing?!

13:45.754 --> 13:48.655
Showing you that this
is the better way.

13:48.724 --> 13:51.325
Stop! Whatever's
inside there is dangerous!

13:54.897 --> 13:56.697
Oh.

13:56.765 --> 13:59.633
And pretty.

14:01.871 --> 14:03.470
What is that?

14:05.074 --> 14:07.508
Are you okay?

14:07.576 --> 14:11.178
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just feeling a little...

14:14.884 --> 14:17.518
...hungry.

14:19.355 --> 14:21.588
Stop eating Bert!

14:25.027 --> 14:26.226
Keep eating Bert!

14:29.465 --> 14:30.397
<i>Leonard.</i>

14:30.466 --> 14:31.665
Leonard!
What? What?

14:31.734 --> 14:33.167
You're having a bad dream.

14:33.235 --> 14:35.068
Oh, thank God.

14:35.137 --> 14:36.603
I was eating my friends.

14:36.672 --> 14:38.739
Well, one friend
and one acquaintance.

14:38.807 --> 14:42.142
You know what, Bert's okay.
Two friends.

14:42.211 --> 14:44.144
Let me see
if you're running a fever.

14:44.213 --> 14:45.145
Yeah.

14:45.214 --> 14:47.181
Oh, yeah,
you're burning up.

14:52.388 --> 14:53.820
Geez!

14:53.889 --> 14:54.889
Are you okay?

14:54.957 --> 14:56.089
That depends.

14:56.158 --> 14:57.824
What-what color are my eyes?

14:57.893 --> 14:59.092
I don't know, brown?

14:59.161 --> 15:01.728
No, green. No, wait, brown.

15:01.797 --> 15:05.232
Oh, good, I'm awake.

15:06.702 --> 15:08.869
Howie, someone's here
to see you.

15:08.938 --> 15:10.337
Hello.

15:10.406 --> 15:12.673
Hey. What's going on?

15:12.741 --> 15:15.042
Can you come
over here?

15:15.110 --> 15:18.345
Sheldon, the deck is safe.
You can walk on it.

15:24.954 --> 15:27.287
Oh, that gets the heart going.
Mm.

15:27.356 --> 15:29.223
So, what's up?

15:29.291 --> 15:31.291
I went down to the city
Code Compliance Office

15:31.360 --> 15:32.292
to turn you in.

15:32.361 --> 15:33.727
Are you kidding?

15:33.796 --> 15:34.728
But I didn't do it.

15:34.797 --> 15:37.231
I filled out the form
and then realized

15:37.299 --> 15:39.233
that the unwritten rules
of friendship

15:39.301 --> 15:41.635
are more important
than the written rules

15:41.704 --> 15:44.571
of the city of Altadena's
Zoning and Planning Department.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.139
Aw.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.609
Really? "Aw"?

15:48.677 --> 15:50.911
And you'll be happy to know
that, while I was there,

15:50.980 --> 15:52.457
I did look into
your neighbor's balcony,

15:52.481 --> 15:54.414
and it is encroaching
on your property line.

15:54.483 --> 15:56.350
I had all this pent-up
snitch energy,

15:56.418 --> 15:58.719
so I reported him hard.

15:58.787 --> 15:59.787
What did they say?

15:59.855 --> 16:01.255
He's going
to have to remove it.

16:01.323 --> 16:03.156
So the good guys win?

16:03.225 --> 16:05.525
Well, I don't know
if I'd call you the good guys.

16:05.594 --> 16:06.893
You're enforcing a law on him

16:06.962 --> 16:08.729
that you're willfully ignoring
yourselves.

16:08.797 --> 16:09.797
Uh, all right, fine.

16:09.865 --> 16:12.432
So the morally
compromised guys win.

16:12.501 --> 16:13.767
Apparently so.

16:13.836 --> 16:15.847
Now, if one of you'd be
kind enough to take me home,

16:15.871 --> 16:16.970
I need to use my bathroom.

16:17.039 --> 16:18.505
What's wrong
with the one here?

16:18.574 --> 16:20.574
I'm sorry, I want to live.

16:25.381 --> 16:27.581
Hey. You guys
got a second?

16:27.650 --> 16:30.317
Leonard, I told you, buddy.
We don't need to use your laser.

16:30.386 --> 16:32.719
Yeah, all we need
is Terry Brad-saw.

16:34.023 --> 16:36.089
That's what I named my saw.

16:37.059 --> 16:38.625
No, I-I just wanted

16:38.694 --> 16:40.060
to apologize for yesterday.

16:40.129 --> 16:43.130
I just-- I think
I was jealous, you know?

16:43.198 --> 16:45.666
Sheldon and Amy
might win a Nobel Prize,

16:45.734 --> 16:48.368
and now you guys have
this cool meteorite project.

16:48.437 --> 16:50.971
- Really? You're jealous of us?
- Yeah.

16:51.040 --> 16:55.575
I even had this crazy dream
last night where I ate you both.

16:56.679 --> 16:58.645
- Seriously?
-Uh...

16:58.714 --> 17:00.180
I know. I was pretty out of it.

17:00.249 --> 17:03.650
Who'd you eat first?

17:03.719 --> 17:05.986
Oh. Uh, you.

17:06.055 --> 17:08.355
Nice.

17:15.864 --> 17:19.532
This is just delightful.

17:19.601 --> 17:23.470
Do you think he knows we're the
ones that got him in trouble?

17:23.539 --> 17:25.405
- Who cares?
-I do. I met his wife.

17:25.473 --> 17:27.406
She seems really nice.

17:27.476 --> 17:29.743
Sorry about
the noise, neighbor!

17:29.812 --> 17:31.244
No problem!

17:31.313 --> 17:34.314
Hey, you guys know
a Sheldon Cooper?!

17:35.918 --> 17:37.851
No, we do not!

17:46.904 --> 17:50.172
Is it just me or has no one
been in the store for hours?

17:50.241 --> 17:52.141
Yeah, it is weirdly quiet.

17:55.379 --> 17:57.646
Nobody's in the street.

17:57.715 --> 18:00.049
Huh. Well,
that's strange.

18:00.117 --> 18:01.517
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

18:01.586 --> 18:04.119
They cut that meteorite open
and unleashed a space plague?

18:04.188 --> 18:05.588
Exactly.

18:05.656 --> 18:07.790
Let me just lock up here.

18:07.859 --> 18:09.191
Okay. So what do we do?

18:09.260 --> 18:10.960
Uh, well, if this is
a worst-case scenario

18:11.028 --> 18:13.195
and we're the last two
people alive, we're gonna,

18:13.264 --> 18:15.064
we're gonna have to
rebuild civilization.

18:15.132 --> 18:17.733
Do you have
any special skills?

18:17.802 --> 18:20.102
I can draw.

18:20.171 --> 18:21.604
How 'bout you?

18:21.672 --> 18:23.105
I can play clarinet.

18:23.174 --> 18:24.907
Oh, I didn't know that.

18:24.976 --> 18:27.042
- Yeah, ten years.
- Ah.

18:27.111 --> 18:31.847
You know, it, uh,
might also be up to us to

18:31.916 --> 18:33.649
repopulate the Earth.

18:33.718 --> 18:35.885
I'm okay with that.

18:35.953 --> 18:39.321
So... shall we?

18:41.425 --> 18:43.325
Wait here. I'm gonna
brush my teeth.

18:50.301 --> 18:51.901
Sorry, we're closed!

18:53.404 --> 18:55.671
This is going on Yelp!
