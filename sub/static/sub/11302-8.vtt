WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:10.803
All right, I got "H-O-R." You
got "H-O." It's your shot.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.639
All right, for this one you
gotta start seated on the tailgate...

00:13.722 --> 00:17.184
- [chuckles softly]
- shoot lefty, hip-hop style,

00:17.267 --> 00:19.019
and punch yourself in
the balls if you miss.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.482
[Rooster grunts]

00:24.567 --> 00:26.235
- [Rooster] Whoo-hoo!
- [laughs]

00:26.318 --> 00:28.111
You're welcome, little buddies.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.672
All right, all
right. Easy, Annie Oakley.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.865
- [laughs]
- I ain't worried.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.826
You ain't never beaten me at
nothing your entire life.

00:33.909 --> 00:34.650
[Rooster] Yeah, yeah.

00:34.675 --> 00:36.227
Yeah, you always choke under pressure.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.038
[scoffs] Yeah, right, that ain't true.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.331
Oh, yeah?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.291
Come on, summer camp? Minigolf?

00:41.374 --> 00:45.087
All you had to do was get it
through the clown's mouth in four shots.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.171
It took you so long

00:46.254 --> 00:48.894
that little girl's birthday
party asked if they could play through.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.782
Yeah, well, right now that little girl's

00:51.807 --> 00:53.536
a hot college student someplace.

00:53.596 --> 00:54.597
She owes me one.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.892
Okay. State fair. Hot
dog eating contest.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.978
Dad had to give you the Heimlich.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.813
You literally choked under pressure.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.357
Shoot the damn gun.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.609
[scoffs]

01:06.692 --> 01:08.347
I'm gonna do what I've been doing

01:08.371 --> 01:09.635
since I was 12 years old.

01:09.695 --> 01:10.988
Hit the bottle.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.324
[Rooster] Oh!

01:15.408 --> 01:16.409
Oh, my God!

01:16.493 --> 01:18.579
If Dad ain't dead, he's gonna be pissed.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.663
[Beau] What the hell?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.081
Shit, he ain't dead.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.792
Yeah, you're not kidding.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.418
Oh, and by the way, you missed.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.544

Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

02:34.071 --> 02:36.114
- Dad, we are so sorry.
- Yeah, we are so sorry.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.825
Before you say anything,
I just wanna let you know,

02:37.908 --> 02:39.242
it was Colt's fault.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.495
I don't care whose fault it was...

02:42.579 --> 02:44.331
Colt's.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.667
What the hell is wrong with you two?

02:46.750 --> 02:50.087
The next time you start messing
around with the guns, do me a favor...

02:50.170 --> 02:51.504
point 'em at each other.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.849
Okay, like I... like I
said, we're real sorry.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.614
I mean, we've just been working so hard,

02:56.639 --> 02:58.244
we were trying to blow off some steam.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.806
- And I... I went to...
- I'll fix the window right away, okay?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.682
- [Colt sighs]
- Who's gonna fix the TV?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.184
TV?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.854
Oh, my God, you killed my best friend!

03:10.648 --> 03:12.775
We'll save up and buy a new one.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.071
We're not gettin' a new
one. We don't need it.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.782
Okay, Dad, you're kiddin', right?

03:18.866 --> 03:22.035
Food, water, shelter, TV. These
are necessities of life.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.998
We gotta stop spendin'
money on things we don't need.

03:26.749 --> 03:29.001
You know what I saw in
the fridge this morning?

03:29.084 --> 03:30.957
Oh, well, I put my cell phone in there

03:30.982 --> 03:32.278
so the FBI can't track me.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.923
I learned that from you, Daddy.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.301
What in the fuck is almond milk?

03:43.348 --> 03:44.432
It's milk.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.727
Show me the tit on an almond.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.023
Look, it's better for
you than regular milk.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.025
It's got less calories and
it's loaded with vitamin E.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.609
It's like coconut water.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.529
Now, you're just makin' shit up.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.909
We have got to stop spending
money on crap like this

04:01.992 --> 04:03.869
when we're trying to
keep this ranch afloat.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.621
Okay. Isn't it always a little bit tight

04:06.704 --> 04:08.623
right before we take
the calves to market?

04:08.706 --> 04:10.667
This year's different.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.961
That's the nature of the beast.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.587
Our bills have doubled.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.714
We got an extra
person living in the house.

04:17.464 --> 04:19.927
That means extra food,
extra utilities...

04:21.053 --> 04:22.512
extra nut juice.

04:25.557 --> 04:28.060
Colt, you heard the man. Get out.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.771
But wait... [stutters]

04:30.854 --> 04:34.191
What about the 15 years when
I didn't use any utilities

04:34.274 --> 04:36.359
'cause I deserted the family?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.362
You're welcome.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.799
On top of that, we got a surprise

04:43.823 --> 04:45.642
assessment from the power co-op

04:45.702 --> 04:49.414
and a love letter from the
state raising our property taxes.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.459
You know what they use
those taxes for? Space ships.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.005
To go diggin' around on Mars.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.132
Hey, NASA, you want red dirt?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.802
Land in my backyard and have at it.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.223
- Well, Dad, maybe we can sell...
- Stop.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.225
I've been giving this a lot of thought

05:08.308 --> 05:11.186
and I don't see any other way around it.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.814
We're gonna have to ask
for a loan to ride this out.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.320
[door closes]

05:22.906 --> 05:24.032
We gotta get a loan?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.452
Man, this is more
serious than I thought.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.246
Dad hates banks.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.617
He always said the only bank

05:30.642 --> 05:32.481
he ever needed was under his mattress.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.949
Pretty stupid thing to tell me,

05:34.960 --> 05:37.545
because the only bank I ever
needed was under his mattress.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.302
Oh, uh, you must be Mr. Bennett.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.804
Uh, I'm Bill Jensen. How are you?

05:46.889 --> 05:50.225
Not great, Mr. Jensen, otherwise
I wouldn't be here.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.395
Well, 'course, uh, times are
very tough for a lot of ranchers.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.355
I can certainly
understand... Oh, oh, excuse me...

05:55.438 --> 05:56.731
excuse me, uh, what's your name?

05:56.814 --> 05:58.358
Oh, hey, I'm the Rooster.

06:00.152 --> 06:04.031
Okay, uh, nice to meet
you, Mr... Rooster.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.804
[stutters] Uh, could you, uh,

06:05.828 --> 06:08.099
please not touch anything on my desk?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.287
Oh, yeah, sure, sorry about that.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.409
- [sighs] That's your wife?
- Uh, that's my daughter.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.083
Ooh. [chuckles] Hello.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.003
She is very beautiful.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.963
Uh, well, here are
some fun facts about her.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.759
She is the class
valedictorian, uh, captain of the soccer team,

06:23.841 --> 06:27.178
she is 17 and her dad
owns five firearms.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.767
So, uh, here is the
standard loan application.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.144
It's, uh, it's fairly simple.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.439
I'm not giving you my
Social Security number.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.025
Okay, so maybe it won't be that simple.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.570
So...

06:45.072 --> 06:47.157
Colt Bennett. [chuckles]

06:47.240 --> 06:49.242
Guilty as charged.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.535
You want me to sign something for you?

06:50.618 --> 06:52.245
A football or a photo?

06:52.329 --> 06:53.935
Uh, never signed a man's chest before,

06:53.960 --> 06:55.565
but if it helps get the loan approved,

06:55.623 --> 06:56.624
well, I'll give it a go.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.918
No, uh, actually we've,
uh, we've met before.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.609
Uh, I was a referee in your division

07:00.633 --> 07:02.195
when you were playing for Garrison.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.341
I haven't always been a, uh,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.569
an award-winning equity loan originator

07:06.594 --> 07:08.577
and customer satisfaction associate.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.637
[chuckles]

07:09.721 --> 07:11.473
You do any of my big games?

07:11.556 --> 07:13.808
Uh, actually, I was behind the whistle

07:13.891 --> 07:16.353
for, uh, the championship
game your Junior year.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.524
- Really?
- Mmm.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.526
- The line judge?
- That's right. That's right.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.904
Uh, growin' up, I knew I
wanted to be either a referee

07:26.989 --> 07:29.366
or a mid-level bank employee.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.409
It's called living two dreams.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.911
You're the reason we lost that game.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.706
- How's that?
- I scored that touchdown at the end.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.376
[sighs] I was afraid of this.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.879
Okay, for the record, you
were down at the one.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.591
But maybe you didn't hear the
whistle 'cause you were too busy

07:46.674 --> 07:48.885
encouraging the opposing
team's fans to, quote,

07:48.969 --> 07:52.722
"Suck it. Suck it all the
way back to Grand Junction."

07:53.723 --> 07:56.018
Everyone in that stadium...

07:56.101 --> 07:58.478
saw me cross that goal
line except for one person.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.855
- [inhales sharply]
- And everyone in this room

08:00.938 --> 08:04.276
is acting real
appropriately except for one person.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.946
Says the guy who wants to
sleep with my underage daughter.

08:09.031 --> 08:12.450
Well, you know what,
it's... You made a bad call.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.119
- Colt.
- [Colt] No, Dad.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.871
No. I mean, come on. [stutters]
People make mistakes.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.541
I mean, except your mistake cost
me the state championship.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.927
Also cost me a hot cheerleader three-way

08:21.952 --> 08:23.861
I was promised if I won the game.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.672
You won the title the next year.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.882
[chuckles] Them girls had graduated.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.051
Dream killer.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.261
Okay, look, you know what?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.971
I did not make a mistake.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.308
I very clearly saw your
knee touch the ground

08:36.390 --> 08:38.643
before the ball broke the
plane of the goal line.

08:38.726 --> 08:42.147
So, you can, "Suck it! Suck
it all the way back to...

08:43.148 --> 08:46.609
3712, uh, County Road 145."

08:46.693 --> 08:49.071
- You know what you can suck?
- [Beau] Colt, shut up.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.448
Okay, I have to put up with my daughter

08:51.531 --> 08:53.242
calling my ex-wife's new husband "Dad,"

08:53.267 --> 08:54.934
but I do not have to put up with this!

08:56.578 --> 08:57.579
[clears throat] Okay.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.081
Deep breath, Bill.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.541
Three, two, one, one, two,
three. What the heck is bothering me?

09:01.624 --> 09:02.750
[clears throat]

09:03.710 --> 09:05.295
I'm sorry about that. [clears throat]

09:05.320 --> 09:06.987
Do you have any questions, Mr. Bennett?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.882
Yeah. Where do I sign?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.425
Uh, right on that last line.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.303
Or you could sign across the
line. He won't know either way.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.097
Okay, that's it! [exhales deeply]

09:15.180 --> 09:18.933
Four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, later I'll have a bottle of wine.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.731
[country music playing on radio]

10:01.601 --> 10:04.146
- [music stops]
- You were down at the one.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.482
[country music playing on radio]

10:15.532 --> 10:17.742
- [watch beeps]
- [inhales deeply] Oh.

10:17.825 --> 10:18.993
[clears throat]

10:19.952 --> 10:20.995
[inhales deeply]

10:21.078 --> 10:22.204
[clears throat]

10:28.253 --> 10:30.130
Oh, oh, hello, Colt.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.464
Am I interrupting?

10:31.548 --> 10:35.385
Oh, no, not at all. Uh, just,
uh, fighting the... the banker's bulge.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.762
Hazards of a sedentary lifestyle.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.390
You know, when you
study the actuary tables,

10:40.473 --> 10:43.059
the numbers show that this
is as dangerous a profession

10:43.143 --> 10:44.311
as being a firefighter.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.647
Really? Well, that...
that can't be true.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.399
When you've brought casseroles

10:49.482 --> 10:51.242
to as many grieving bankers' widows

10:51.266 --> 10:52.634
as I have, then we'll talk.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.032
Okay. Um, I just...
I wanted to apologize.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.368
I think I came on a
little bit too strong.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.579
Colt... [scoffs] I get it.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.992
You know... [stammers] we're a couple

11:05.017 --> 11:06.732
of testosterone-fueled men.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.462
Two big bucks, knocking antlers.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.129
Getting that velvet off.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.634
Okay, uh... [stutters]
I was just... I'm...

11:16.718 --> 11:18.595
I just hope this
doesn't affect the loan.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.137
Oh, no! Uh, not at all.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.306
Uh, I would never do that.

11:21.331 --> 11:22.748
You have nothing to worry about.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.352
Uh, the loan is being
turned down purely on merit.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.104
Turned down? Why?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.983
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm
paid to assess risk.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.664
And between the debt-equity ratio

11:33.689 --> 11:35.427
and those new banking regulations...

11:35.487 --> 11:37.989
Thanks, Obama. [sighs]

11:38.072 --> 11:40.074
It's just a risk we
can't absorb right now.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.744
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.662
[stutters] My dad's not a risk.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.415
He's a... he's a great rancher.

11:47.499 --> 11:48.916
I'm not saying he isn't.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.904
Look... [sighs] approving a loan

11:50.929 --> 11:53.069
is a completely objective process.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.172
It's like reffing a football game.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.216
I didn't want to call
you down at the one.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.926
That was a bad night for me, too.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.138
You know, somebody
peed in my convertible?

12:04.015 --> 12:05.350
I did not know that.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.686
Oh, yeah, yeah. People hated me.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.688
Bags of crap on my doorstep,

12:10.772 --> 12:12.940
uh, dirty looks when
I went to the store.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.475
Why do you think I have to keep myself

12:14.500 --> 12:15.801
in the peak of physical condition?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.028
I have to live here.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.821
Between denying loans

12:18.905 --> 12:21.408
and my years as a ref, I
don't have many friends left.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.825
I'll be your friend.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.369
Colt, I can't give you the loan.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.703
Fuck you, Bill!

12:26.704 --> 12:27.830
Friendship over!

12:31.167 --> 12:33.210
[wheel clacking through speakers]

12:36.964 --> 12:39.005
- [man on TV] Can I get a "T"?
- What are you doing?

12:39.842 --> 12:42.136
I'm listening to the Wheel of Fortune.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.389
How's that going?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.600
Category is Phrase.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.227
There's two T's on the
board but I can't tell where.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.819
Loan got denied.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.780
What? You serious?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.032
Yeah.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.285
The guy said... [clears
throat] the ranch was too much risk.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.621
[turns TV off]

13:08.705 --> 13:11.290
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah, right?

13:11.374 --> 13:13.751
[sighs] Oh, man,
what're we gonna do now?

13:15.211 --> 13:16.546
I don't know.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.717
Get some odd jobs, sell off some shit.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.929
How much you think we can get for
a 50-inch flat-screen... radio?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.142
Yo, how bad of shape
do you think we're in?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.215
[sighs] You know how at the airport

13:33.240 --> 13:34.880
they got those colors to tell you

13:34.939 --> 13:36.733
- how scared you're supposed to be?
- Yeah.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.068
Well, I got a similar system to
rank the state of the ranch.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.152
I use quarterbacks.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.573
When the ranch is in perfect
condition, it's "John Elway."

13:43.656 --> 13:44.991
Obviously.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.326
What state are we in now?

13:47.410 --> 13:48.620
"Tim Tebow."

13:51.748 --> 13:55.084
It's real bad, but at least we
know we got God rooting for us.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.721
Which one of you two numb nuts

14:01.746 --> 14:04.200
left the pitchfork laying
in the driveway?

14:05.094 --> 14:07.680
Well, looks like you're in a good mood.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.098
Colt's got something to tell ya.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.684
Plus, he's the one who left
the pitchfork in the driveway.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.021
I went back to the bank.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.065
We didn't get the loan.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.110
Okay.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.033
Do you want to talk about this?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.284
We just did.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.371
I'm gonna go check the generator.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.330
[door closes]

14:37.669 --> 14:39.379
He didn't even yell.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.755
Yeah, this is real bad.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.008
I don't think we're
in "Tim Tebow" anymore.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.219
What's worse than "Tim Tebow"?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.180
"Colt Bennett."

14:54.268 --> 14:55.520
[chuckling]

15:00.900 --> 15:02.068
What are you doing?

15:04.028 --> 15:05.447
Adding a little A1 sauce.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.365
Are you saying the
steak needs improvement?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.786
[whispers] Do not answer. It's a trap.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.960
No, I'm just changing
the flavor profile.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.962
Oh, that's a bad answer.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.881
If you bought a Ferrari...

15:24.632 --> 15:26.134
would you get an automatic?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.860
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's the only way

15:28.885 --> 15:30.286
they make 'em these days, Dad.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.682
I hate you.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.142
[chuckles]

15:38.730 --> 15:40.022
You see?

15:40.106 --> 15:41.283
You mess up Dad's steak

15:41.308 --> 15:43.509
and he turns the
power off with his mind.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.364
Oh, probably just blew a fuse.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.532
[Beau] Nope.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.076
I turned it off.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.371
Changes are a-comin', boys.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.750
I called the power company and
had 'em cut off the electricity.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.455
Are we really in that bad a shape?

16:02.480 --> 16:03.987
You had to turn the power off?

16:04.046 --> 16:05.632
[Rooster] Yeah, Dad, you
didn't have to do that.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.634
We need money that
bad, I can sell my bike.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.317
Although I still think option number one

16:09.337 --> 16:10.541
should be getting rid of Colt.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.306
I'm doing this while
I still have a choice.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.323
We got plenty of propane

16:16.348 --> 16:18.669
to run the
generator for the essentials...

16:19.353 --> 16:20.812
until we get the calves to market.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.983
Gonna save us a couple of
hundred dollars a month.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.278
It's a pretty big decision to make.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.561
Why didn't you ask our opinion?

16:29.614 --> 16:34.076
Well, short answer is I don't
care about your opinions.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.530
And the long answer is

16:36.556 --> 16:38.772
I don't give a shit about your opinions.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.671
You know, we've been
working our asses off.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.590
This isn't just your
ranch. This is our ranch.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.968
Yeah. I mean, when you
die, I want to run this place.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.095
You know, it's when you
say stupid shit like that,

16:53.179 --> 16:54.620
he's not gonna respect our opinions.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.893
You really think this is your ranch?

17:00.269 --> 17:04.607
You spend half your time drinking
and fucking off like 12-year-olds.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.381
You picked a fight with the man

17:07.406 --> 17:09.803
that was responsible
for giving us a loan.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.741
Dad, I offered to set
your banking up online.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.328
I offered to put in a
cistern to collect the runoff.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.496
We try to help, you don't let us.

17:19.580 --> 17:23.375
When you really wanna help
someone, you don't offer. You just do it.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.127
You start doin' that...

17:26.921 --> 17:28.505
I'll ask for your opinion.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.468
You two wanna be shown respect?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.888
Start growing up.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.474
Act like men.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.193
You had to put A1 sauce on your steak.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.116
[upbeat music playing]

17:58.535 --> 18:00.287
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.789
Can I charge my phone back there?

18:01.873 --> 18:03.916
Oh, Hank's charging his iPad.

18:05.835 --> 18:06.878
You have an iPad?

18:06.961 --> 18:09.797
What, I can't have nice things?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.051
What's wrong?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.053
What makes you think something's wrong?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.916
Well, you just picked up a random beer

18:17.941 --> 18:19.080
and started drinking it.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.934
We're not supposed to do that?

18:22.810 --> 18:23.811
Look, Colt,

18:23.895 --> 18:27.273
if I'm going to be a widow or
a grandmother, I need to know.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.734
Those are two completely
different outfits.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.486
[stammers]

18:35.197 --> 18:36.240
Okay.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.118
You remember my Junior year in
the state championship game

18:39.201 --> 18:40.327
where I scored a touchdown and...

18:40.411 --> 18:41.913
You didn't score a touchdown.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.793
Whatever. Uh, it's...

18:47.877 --> 18:49.586
Okay, don't tell Dad that I told you.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.798
We didn't get the loan.

18:52.715 --> 18:53.800
Dad had to turn off the power.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.010
- [sighs] Really?
- Yeah.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.680
Rooster said it's the
worst he's ever seen it.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.223
He called it "Colt Bennett bad."

19:03.184 --> 19:06.520
While I don't appreciate being
at the bottom of that scale...

19:06.603 --> 19:08.480
- it scared the crap out of me.
- Yeah.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.025
Well, if it's any help...

19:11.108 --> 19:13.778
in the winter of '81, we
lost almost half the herd.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.487
We turned off the
power till the next spring.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.781
But we made it through.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.034
That was "Colt Bennett bad."

19:21.577 --> 19:22.638
[stutters] Once again,

19:22.663 --> 19:24.688
I don't think we need to use that scale.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.417
- I suppose that's reassuring.
- Yeah.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.419
You know, your father's been
able to handle anything

19:30.502 --> 19:32.088
that's ever been thrown his way.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.256
If there were one
rancher in this whole state

19:34.340 --> 19:35.820
who can make it through a tough time,

19:35.837 --> 19:36.804
I'd bet on Beau Bennett.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.388
So, you just do whatever
you can to support him.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.472
Support him?

19:41.555 --> 19:43.599
[stutters] I don't
even know how bad it is.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.852
I mean, he won't tell
us what's happening,

19:45.935 --> 19:47.215
he won't involve us in anything,

19:47.216 --> 19:48.628
and he won't let anybody help him.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.189
Oh, trust me, I know.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.359
He thinks tow truck
drivers are enablers.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.321
Look, son,

19:57.404 --> 20:00.157
you grew up on that
ranch. You know what to do.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.618
Well...

20:04.746 --> 20:05.747
Thanks, Mom.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.915
- Yeah.
- Hey.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.878
How'd you and Dad make it three
months without any power?

20:13.004 --> 20:15.667
Well, the power
went out in the winter...

20:15.691 --> 20:17.782
and you were born the next fall,

20:17.842 --> 20:18.885
- so we basically just...
- Okay, okay, okay.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.177
I got it.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.267
Power out?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.396
No, it's mood lighting.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.066
Can I talk to you?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.235
Do I have to talk back?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.989
Oh, so it's bad mood lighting.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.327
[sighs] I spoke with Colt.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.664
Damn kid can't keep his mouth shut.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.834
Yeah, he's kind of the
opposite of his father that way.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.170
He was scared.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.048
And I told him about '81 and
I think it reassured him.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.175
In '81, we got the loan.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.803
Yeah, I might've left that part out.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.972
You know, this is like
when you didn't want me

21:05.056 --> 21:07.099
to tell him there was no Santa Claus.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.600
He was four.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.021
And you wonder why he's soft.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.399
You still didn't have
to tell him in the mall,

21:15.482 --> 21:17.193
in front of all those other kids.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.530
Saved all those parents two
hours of waiting in line.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.787
You know, if I had any
money to give you, I would.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.457
Well, I appreciate that, Mags.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.918
But I wouldn't take it if you did.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.841
Although maybe Colt would
want it for that coconut water.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.261
Is that a real thing?

21:45.847 --> 21:47.181
I believe it is.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.184
I hate everyone.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.522
Look, I've been
thinking, and just hear me out...

21:55.606 --> 21:58.067
I could put the bar
up as collateral for you.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.321
And I appreciate that...

22:02.404 --> 22:04.824
but that's the same
as offering me money.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.578
You need help. It may
as well come from me.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.373
This ranch isn't your
concern anymore, Maggie.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.877
Bullshit. My sons still live here.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.162
And whether we end up divorced or not,

22:18.187 --> 22:19.654
that makes it my concern.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.466
Plus, if you lose this place,

22:22.549 --> 22:24.010
they're gonna want to live
with me in my Airstream

22:24.093 --> 22:26.345
and there's no fucking
way that's gonna happen.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.849
I don't want your money...

22:31.642 --> 22:32.977
and I don't want to talk.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.937
I got enough problems.

22:36.563 --> 22:38.983
Yeah, well, now you got one less.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.907
I don't hate you.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.743
Or Ronald Reagan.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.545
You know what the worst part
about living without power is?

22:59.628 --> 23:03.215
Yeah, no hair dryer. This
is a selfie-free day.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.803
No, man. The worst part about
living without power

23:07.886 --> 23:09.221
is means living without porn.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.392
Earlier today, I had to
use a T.J. Maxx catalog.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.478
Thank God for yoga pants.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.442
Colt, what in the hell do
you think you're doing?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.154
Chopping wood, helping out.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.198
Isn't that what you want us to do?

23:27.281 --> 23:30.367
What I want you to do is
keep your mouth shut.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.449
What are you talking about?

23:33.454 --> 23:36.665
The fact that you're talking to
your mother about our business.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.670
Oh, oh. So, now that you're
pissed, it's our business.

23:41.753 --> 23:42.911
All right, let's not forget

23:42.937 --> 23:44.780
that Colt's the one
who opened his mouth.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.593
He's also the one who puts
A1 sauce on your steak, so...

23:48.677 --> 23:51.555
The last thing I need is
your mother coming here,

23:51.638 --> 23:53.182
putting her nose in it,

23:53.265 --> 23:55.892
and offering to put up
the bar as collateral.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.312
She did that?

23:59.688 --> 24:00.731
That's great.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.567
Yeah, then, we can go get the loan.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.445
I told her no way in hell.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.824
Why would you do that?

24:10.907 --> 24:13.077
You're always bitching how
Mom chose the bar over you,

24:13.160 --> 24:15.162
now she's willing to put
it up to save your ass,

24:15.246 --> 24:16.872
you're too proud to accept her help?

24:16.955 --> 24:17.956
Yeah...

24:18.874 --> 24:20.751
we all got to change...

24:20.834 --> 24:22.758
but you can still be the same

24:22.783 --> 24:24.905
bull-headed, stubborn jackass?

24:24.963 --> 24:26.007
Is that how it works?

24:28.759 --> 24:30.761
I'm gonna go check the generator.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.950
He's always going to
check the generator.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.224
I think he just says that 'cause

24:41.249 --> 24:42.883
he doesn't want to listen to us anymore.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.360
So, anyway...

24:46.443 --> 24:49.071
I was trying to use the
Lands' End catalog...

24:49.155 --> 24:52.741
it's, like, wintertime, so
everyone's wearing a sweater.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.163
I'm gonna go check the generator.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.543
[somber country music playing]

25:33.031 --> 25:34.241
Hey.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.454
Okay, I'd offer you a whiskey, but...

25:38.537 --> 25:39.955
I know you're closed.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.666
Well, I was gonna say,
you couldn't afford it.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.629
Suppose I deserve that.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.548
What are you doing here, Beau?

25:49.631 --> 25:52.384
- Listen, I came here...
- No, you know what?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.010
You listen to me.

25:54.095 --> 25:57.431
I care about this ranch and
I care about this family.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.850
And I'm really not in
the mood to talk to you

25:59.933 --> 26:01.352
if you're not gonna let me help.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.438
Well, that's fair.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.273
Just let me say this.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.325
When I was a kid, my dad

26:09.350 --> 26:11.844
was real straight on how to run a ranch.

26:12.946 --> 26:16.950
Cattle are grass-fed,
don't waste free water...

26:17.909 --> 26:20.954
and try to run out of
whiskey and time on the same day.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.625
He was a good man.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.335
Yeah.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.587
He was a lot like me.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.006
But, you know, without
the sense of humor.

26:35.136 --> 26:36.845
He taught me everything I know.

26:38.680 --> 26:43.185
Most of all, he taught me that hard
work will always get you through.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.939
What he didn't say is what to
do when hard work wasn't enough.

26:48.023 --> 26:51.943
Beau, I've built up some
equity in this place. Why not use it?

26:52.027 --> 26:55.113
Maggie, it's not that
I don't want your help.

26:55.989 --> 27:00.076
If I let you put this
place at risk and I fail...

27:01.287 --> 27:03.079
then I take you down with me.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.500
Well, I believe in you. So,
that's not gonna happen.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.547
I wish I believed
that as much as you do.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.383
Come on, everything's
gonna be all right.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.595
I'm proud of you, Maggie...

27:20.347 --> 27:21.973
what you've done here.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.936
You know that, right?

27:26.019 --> 27:27.228
I do now.
