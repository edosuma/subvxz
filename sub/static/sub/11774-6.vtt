WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:06.774
( theme music playing )

00:13.247 --> 00:15.649
( liquid flowing )

00:20.854 --> 00:23.124
- JEEZ.
- ( toilet flushing )

00:23.224 --> 00:27.061
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

00:27.161 --> 00:29.230
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
WAS THAT?
- WHAT?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.332
WHAT, DO YOU GOT SEABISCUIT
IN THERE WITH YOU?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.401
- WHAT?
- THAT WAS CRAZY.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.836
- OH, YEAH.
- I NEVER HEARD A...

00:35.936 --> 00:38.372
- A STREAM LIKE THAT.
- ( laughing )

00:40.040 --> 00:42.476
YEAH, I'M TAKING
THIS NEW PILL.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.045
THAT IS, LIKE, NOT HUMAN,
THAT SOUND.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.715
IT'S GOT SOME BACKSPLASH TOO.
I GOTTA BE CAREFUL.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.782
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.684
ALL RIGHT, SO... ANYWAY,

00:50.784 --> 00:54.888
IT SEEMS LIKE MEG RYAN
IS JUST NOT GONNA WORK,

00:54.988 --> 00:56.590
BECAUSE HER SCHEDULE
IS TOO BUSY

00:56.690 --> 00:58.959
- AND WE'RE NOT GONNA GET HER.
- WORK? WORK FOR WHAT?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.794
FOR GEORGE'S EX-WIFE.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.931
BUT LISA KUDROW

01:04.031 --> 01:05.866
I THINK WOULD ALSO
BE GREAT.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.868
- SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS.
- GREAT ACTRESS.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.503
BUT I THINK YOU WANT...

01:09.603 --> 01:12.440
I THINK YOU WANT TO GO
WITH AN UNKNOWN
FOR THIS PART.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.476
- WHY?
- BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE
THAT IT'S REAL.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.146
WHAT'S REAL GOT TO DO
WITH WHAT WE DO?

01:18.246 --> 01:20.948
WELL, WHEN GEORGE'S EX-WIFE
CALLS HIM FROM THE PLANE,

01:21.048 --> 01:23.217
RIGHT?
AND, UH...

01:23.317 --> 01:25.253
HE'S GOT
THE TIVO GUY THERE...

01:25.353 --> 01:27.755
- MM-HMM?
- ...THAT HAPPENED TO ME

01:27.855 --> 01:29.056
- WITH CHERYL.
- UH-HUH.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.592
CHERYL SHOULD PLAY
THIS PART.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.594
CHERYL!

01:33.694 --> 01:36.197
MAYBE SOMEBODY THAT LOOKS
LIKE CHERYL, THAT'S AN IDEA.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.166
- NO, BUT SHE--
- WHAT ABOUT RENEE ZELLWEGER?

01:38.266 --> 01:41.802
BUT CHERYL, SHE'S UNKNOWN
AND SHE LIVED THIS PART.

01:41.902 --> 01:45.005
- AND SHE'S AN ACTRESS!
- SO THE PERSON THAT IT
HAPPENS TO

01:45.105 --> 01:46.740
- IS THE BEST ACTOR?
- WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?

01:46.840 --> 01:49.643
YOU THINK NIXON
COULD HAVE BEEN NIXON
IN "FROST/NIXON"?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.712
- NIXON'S NOT AN ACTOR.
- NEITHER IS CHERYL.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.148
- SHE IS.
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HAVE HER READ.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.184
SHE CAN READ.
MAYBE SHE'LL GET IT.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.352
- I'M OPEN TO IT.
- YOU'RE OPEN TO IT.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.222
- YES.
- HEY, GUYS, HERE'S
THE LATEST SCRIPTS.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.457
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.394
AND, OH!
REMINDER-- YOU HAVE LUNCH
WITH RICHARD LEWIS,

02:06.494 --> 02:07.928
- BOTH OF YOU.
- OKAY, THANKS.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.363
- WHAT IS THAT?
- ( rattling )

02:09.463 --> 02:11.432
YEAH, THAT
AIR CONDITIONER IS--
I DON'T KNOW.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.601
- IT'S MAKING NOISE UP THERE.
- OH, I'LL GET IT.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.369
OH, HERE WE GO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.838
I USED TO DO THIS FOR MY MOM
ALL THE TIME.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.843
OH, YEP, HANG ON.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.148
THERE WE GO.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.885
IT SMELLS LIKE
A RATTLESNAKE IS IN THERE.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.521
OH, THERE--

02:33.621 --> 02:36.056
- DOES THAT SOUND BETTER?
- YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BETTER.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.090
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.227
THERE WE GO.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.362
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

02:41.462 --> 02:42.896
- ARE YOU GOOD?
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.097
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.434
- OKAY, THANKS, MAUREEN.
- YEAH.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.702
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.705
- HOW CAN SHE WALK
AROUND LIKE THAT?
- EVERY DAY.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.106
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.108
WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.978
WE CAN'T.
JULIA GOT HER THE JOB.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.280
WE CAN'T FIRE HER.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.815
- WE HAVE TO TALK TO HER.
- OH, OKAY.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.884
YOU NEED TO TALK TO HER
ABOUT HER CLOTHING.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.720
- I-- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.021
I CAN'T-- I CAN'T DO IT.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.457
WHY NOT?

03:09.557 --> 03:12.460
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- DO YOU THINK I WANT TO?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.127
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- YOU HAVE TO.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.195
- I HAVE TO?
- YES.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.897
ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU DO IT.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.668
NO, BUT YOU--
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
YOU DO SO WELL.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.969
- I DO WELL?
- YES!

03:22.069 --> 03:23.537
ARE YOU NUTS?
THIS IS YOUR FORTE.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.773
- NO NO NO NO NO.
- YES YES YES.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.509
YOU'RE SMART AND ELOQUENT,
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.945
THIS IS NOT
A CALL FOR ELOQUENCE.
THIS IS A CALL FOR CHARM,

03:32.045 --> 03:33.947
FOR, YOU KNOW, LIGHTNESS

03:34.047 --> 03:35.583
AND BREEZINESS.
THAT'S YOU.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.286
YOU'RE REALLY THE BOSS.
YOU'RE THE STAR OF THE SHOW.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.187
SHE'D REALLY RESPECT IT
COMING FROM YOU.

03:40.288 --> 03:43.023
I'M WHITE GLOVE.
WHITE GLOVES, LARRY.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.792
I DON'T DO THOSE THINGS.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.595
WHEN WE DID THE SHOW,
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
DID THIS STUFF.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.031
REMEMBER THE COOK?
HOW YOU TOLD HER SHE WAS
USING TOO MUCH MAYONNAISE?

03:51.131 --> 03:52.500
- YOU DID THAT!
- I KNOW.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.068
AND SHE CAME BACK
THE NEXT DAY DULY CHASTENED,

03:55.168 --> 03:56.537
FIXED THE TUNA,
FIXED THE EGG SALAD.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.772
I KNOW, BUT MAYONNAISE
IS NOT PERSONAL.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.810
THE MAYONNAISE IS AS
PERSONAL TO THE CHEF AS HER
FLABBY STOMACH IS TO HER.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.846
SO HOW ARE WE
GONNA DECIDE WHO'S--
I'M NOT DOING IT.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.948
WE'LL CHOOSE.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.249
- ODDS EVEN.
- ONE TAKES.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.051
- ONE TAKES.
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

04:11.151 --> 04:12.353
- ODDS.
- YOU GOT ODDS?

04:12.453 --> 04:13.554
- I GOT EVENS.
- OKAY.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.723
- ONE TWO THREE--
- Both: SHOOT!

04:15.823 --> 04:17.458
I WIN.
DO IT.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.262
OKAY, THANK YOU.
BYE.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.470
- HEY, LARRY.
- HEY.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.472
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- NOT TOO MUCH.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.241
- YEAH?
- JERRY AND I WERE
JUST TALKING.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.243
MM-HMM.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.279
AND...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.615
WE KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE
BIT OF A PROBLEM...

04:41.715 --> 04:43.917
OH NO.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.386
...WITH THE, UH...

04:45.486 --> 04:47.588
THE BARE MIDRIFF.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.124
WHAT-- WITH MY SHIRT?

04:51.224 --> 04:53.293
THIS IS ALL EXPOSED
AND THE STOMACH--

04:53.394 --> 04:55.896
IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE...

04:55.996 --> 04:59.099
- UH-HUH.
- ...MAYBE YOU COULD START
WEARING LONGER SHIRTS?

04:59.199 --> 05:02.135
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- OKAY.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.804
- I SEE, OKAY.
- WHAT?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.973
- IT'S BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.
I UNDERSTAND.
- NO!

05:06.073 --> 05:08.576
- ( Larry stammers )
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
LIKE THAT, LARRY,

05:08.676 --> 05:11.011
- BUT I GUESS YOU ARE.
- I'M NOT LIKE THAT!
NO, I'M NOT.

05:11.111 --> 05:14.682
BECAUSE IF A MAN WAS
WEARING THIS, YOU WOULDN'T GO
OUT AND SAY ANYTHING TO HIM.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.284
EVEN IF IT WAS A MAN,
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE THAT.

05:17.385 --> 05:20.621
"THAT"?
WHAT IS "THAT," LARRY?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.690
WELL, THAT.
YOU KNOW.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.393
- WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS?
- DO I?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.728
- YES.
- OH.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.598
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.
- WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, LARRY?

05:30.698 --> 05:33.501
- ARE YOU OFFENDED BY MY BODY?
- NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL!

05:33.601 --> 05:36.336
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY
APPROPRIATE ATTIRE
FOR AN OFFICE.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.539
OKAY, SO YOU WANT ME
TO WEAR, LIKE, A BURKA?

05:38.639 --> 05:42.376
NOT A BURKA, BUT SOMETHING
IN-BETWEEN THIS AND A BURKA.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.778
DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE
LOST 68 LBS IN TWO YEARS?

05:44.878 --> 05:47.147
- THAT IS FANTASTIC.
- THANK YOU.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.117
- I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
- I'M VERY PROUD OF IT AND I
WANT TO FLAUNT WHAT I'VE GOT.

05:50.217 --> 05:54.855
YOU CAN FLAUNT
2/3 OF THE DAY
OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE.

05:54.955 --> 05:58.158
AND THEN YOU GOT 1/3 NON-FLAUNT.
DO YOU HAVE TO FLAUNT 24 HOURS?

05:58.258 --> 05:59.960
WHY NOT TAKE A BREAK
IN THE FLAUNT?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.929
WHY WOULD I NEED TO TAKE
A BREAK IN THE FLAUNT?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.164
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
BEING A LITTLE MYSTERIOUS--

06:04.264 --> 06:06.567
"OOOH, WHAT'S UNDER THAT?

06:06.667 --> 06:09.236
HEY, LOOK AT THAT WOMAN.
WHAT HAS SHE GOT
UNDER THERE?

06:09.336 --> 06:11.505
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT ONE?"
- YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?

06:11.605 --> 06:13.441
I DON'T NEED THIS, OKAY?
I QUIT. I'M SORRY.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.876
- YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?
- YEAH, I CAN'T DO IT, LARRY.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.679
- I'M NOT GONNA DO
THIS STUFF FOR YOU ANYMORE.
- NO, I UNDERSTAND.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.848
- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
- I'M NOT GOING ON VITAMIN RUNS.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.551
- I'M NOT GONNA GO BUY
YOUR SOCKS FOR YOU ANYMORE.
- YEAH, I'LL BUY MY OWN SOCKS.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.318
THAT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.421
- SERIOUSLY?
- YES, I'M GONE, LARRY!

06:27.521 --> 06:29.657
( door slams )

06:31.224 --> 06:32.860
DONE!

06:34.027 --> 06:36.797
Jerry:
I CANNOT BELIEVE
SHE'S GONE.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.966
I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WOULD
CHANGE WHAT SHE WORE.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.801
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT WE COULD
BE DONE WITH HER COMPLETELY.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.736
BUT ISN'T THAT REALLY
WHY YOU SENT ME IN?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.372
I MEAN, WERE YOU THINKING
OF IT SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK
OF YOUR MIND?

06:45.473 --> 06:47.808
- I WAS HOPING, YEAH.
I WAS THINKING...
- THAT I WOULD MISHANDLE THAT

06:47.908 --> 06:50.611
- AND IT WOULD LEAD
TO SOMETHING TERRIBLE?
- I THOUGHT, "THIS BULVAN

06:50.711 --> 06:53.847
WILL WALK IN THERE
AND IN TWO MINUTES

06:53.947 --> 06:57.685
SHE'LL BE OUT IN A HUFF."
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.789
- ( honks )
- Larry: HEY, COME ON, MAN!

07:01.889 --> 07:03.891
- JUST PULLING OUT LIKE THAT!
- IDIOT!

07:03.991 --> 07:05.125
WHAT'S HE DOING?

07:05.225 --> 07:07.628
YOU GOT SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO SAY TO ME, CUNTFACE?

07:07.728 --> 07:09.429
- HUH?
- HEY, LOOK, I'M SORRY.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.364
I DIDN'T
SEE YOU PULL OUT.
I'M SORRY.

07:11.465 --> 07:14.434
LEARN TO FUCKING DRIVE,
YOU FUCK!

07:16.403 --> 07:19.673
( exhales )

07:19.773 --> 07:22.375
- Larry: HONKING'S
VERY DANGEROUS.
- Jerry: YEAH.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.412
I TRY NEVER TO HONK.
ONLY IN DIRE EMERGENCIES.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.015
SO YOU JUST WAIT IF
SOMEONE'S IN FRONT OF YOU,
THE LIGHT HAS TURNED--

07:28.115 --> 07:30.518
- YEAH. YEAH.
- NOTHING? YOU JUST SIT
BEHIND THEM AND WAIT?

07:30.618 --> 07:33.053
- CAN YOU DO A LITTLE-- HUH?
- THE GENTLE HONK?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.421
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.423
- THE THROAT CLEAR.
- THE MOST I COULD DO

07:36.524 --> 07:38.692
- IS A GENTLE HONK.
- EXACTLY.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.428
- "HELLO, EXCUSE ME."
- DO YOU HAVE THAT TECHNIQUE?

07:41.529 --> 07:43.363
- I DO A GREAT EXCUSE ME.
- IT'S A LANGUAGE.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
- IT'S A LANG-- ABSOLUTELY.
- YEAH.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.235
- BY THE WAY.
- WHAT?

07:48.335 --> 07:50.470
HOW MANY NAPKINS
DOES A PERSON NEED

07:50.571 --> 07:52.339
TO GET THROUGH A SANDWICH?

07:52.439 --> 07:54.141
I DON'T KNOW.
I USE A LOT OF NAPKINS.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.977
- ALWAYS. EVERY MEAL.
- YOU SHOULD BRING
A BATH TOWEL TO EAT.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.912
- ( laughing )
- THAT'S WHAT YOU
SHOULD BRING.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.681
- HEY, GUYS, I'M SO--
- HEY!

08:00.781 --> 08:02.716
- HEY HEY, MAN,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HOW ARE YOU?

08:02.816 --> 08:05.385
- LONG TIME. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.487
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO.
- PLEA-- YEAH.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.757
Larry:
WE-- WE ORDERED.
WE COULDN'T WAIT.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.425
I CAN SEE.
BUT I'M-- CAN I--
I WANT TO EAT SOMETHING.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.161
I'M FAMISHED, SO...

08:14.261 --> 08:16.864
- YOU KNOW, CAN I--
I'M STARVED.
- Jerry: OH.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.567
- MOVE OVER.
- I'M STARVED.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.302
- YOU SHOULD-- YOU KNOW.
- WHAT? NO, YOU.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.638
WHAT'S GOING ON?
CAN I SIT DOWN?

08:24.738 --> 08:26.540
COME ON, SCOOTCH OVER.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.777
HOW MANY YEARS
YOU GUYS-- YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
YOU'RE CLOSE FRIENDS.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.780
RIGHT, I KNOW HIM LONGER
SO HE SHOULD SIT OVER THERE,

08:32.880 --> 08:35.315
BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY GONNA BE
TALKING TO HIM MORE THAN YOU

08:35.415 --> 08:36.984
SO I SHOULD HAVE
EYE CONTACT WITH HIM

08:37.084 --> 08:39.319
AS OPPOSED
TO TURNING AROUND
AND STRAINING MY NECK.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.689
YOU KNOW, I'M A LEFTY.
I CAN'T--

08:41.789 --> 08:43.991
IT'LL BE TO YOUR RIGHT.
IT WORKS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.761
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANT ME TO SLIDE OVER
IS BECAUSE YOU WANT

08:47.861 --> 08:50.463
- THE LUXURY SUITE.
- OF COURSE I WANT
THE LUXURY SUITE.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.465
- YOU WANT THE LUXURY SUITE TOO.
- YES, I DO.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.835
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT, I DO.
BUT YOU--

08:56.570 --> 08:58.138
- HEY, WHERE'D HE GO?
- OH MY GOD.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.609
- WHAT THE HELL?
- Richard: I'M FUCKING
ANGRY AT YOU.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.420
HI, GUYS.
HI!

09:13.520 --> 09:15.122
- HI.
- I WAS JUST ON THE LOT.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.390
- I THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND SAY HI.
- HI, CHERYL.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.660
JERRY, I WANTED
TO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.561
- OH.

BE SO GREAT.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.496
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME
THE PART

09:23.597 --> 09:25.098
IN THE "SEINFELD" REUNION.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.335
- THE--?
- THE PART ON
THE REUNION SHOW?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.604
- YOU KNOW.
- OH.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.641
- SO--
- I AM SO EXCITED
ABOUT IT

09:33.741 --> 09:36.276
- AND I WANTED
TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY.
- OH, WELL,

09:36.376 --> 09:38.746
I'M-- I--
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

09:38.846 --> 09:42.750
- I CAN'T EITHER!
- WHY DON'T-- I'LL GO
MEET YOU UPSTAIRS.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.852
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.020
I'LL SEE YOU UPSTAIRS.
GO--

09:47.120 --> 09:48.922
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.323
ALL RIGHT.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.626
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.329
- I GOT AN ODD, UM--
- NO.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.597
--VIBE FROM HIM.
NO?

09:57.698 --> 09:59.399
NO.
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING IS

09:59.499 --> 10:01.268
YOU PROB-- UM...

10:01.368 --> 10:03.336
YOU'RE KINDA GONNA HAVE TO--

10:03.436 --> 10:06.373
- AUDITION, YEAH.
- I HAVE TO AUDITION
FOR THIS PART?

10:06.473 --> 10:08.575
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID I HAD IT.
- NO, YOU DO HAVE IT.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.744
- YOU DO HAVE IT, YOU KNOW.
- THAT'S WHY--

10:10.844 --> 10:12.680
IT'S LIKE WINNING AN ELECTION
BUT WAITING TO GET SWORN IN.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.415
SO THE AUDITION
IS THE SWEARING IN.
IT'S NOTHING.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.450
- IT'S A FORMALITY.
- FORMALITY, YEAH.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.452
- BUT I HAVE THE PART?
- YOU JUST SHOW UP AND READ IT,

10:19.552 --> 10:21.889
- AND JUST-- YOU KNOW,
HE NEEDS TO SEE THAT--
- READ IT?

10:21.989 --> 10:24.658
--HE NEEDS TO SEE THAT YOU
CAN READ AND WRITE,
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.193
- ALL RIGHT, WELL--
- ALL RIGHT, SO--

10:26.293 --> 10:28.696
I'LL SEE YOU, UH...
YOU'LL CALL ME AND TELL ME.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.831
- OKAY.
- RIGHT? WHEN TO COME IN AND--

10:30.931 --> 10:32.299
- YEAH.
- --FOR THE FORMALITY.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.567
- YOU LOOK GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.070
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU
WOULD HAVE THE AUDACITY

10:37.170 --> 10:40.373
TO EVEN-- TO EVEN
BROACH THE SUBJECT,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.943
- TO HAVE THE GUT-- OKAY.
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I DIDN'T DO IT.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.779
EXCUSE ME, HE DID IT.
LISTEN,

10:45.879 --> 10:47.881
WHAT IS THIS
WITH MAUREEN?
WHAT-- WHAT--

10:47.981 --> 10:50.317
I TRIED TO BE
VERY SENSITIVE.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.752
I-- I DID,
BUT SHE STORMED OUT.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.654
YOU CAN'T GO UP TO A WOMAN

10:54.755 --> 10:57.157
AND TELL HER THAT HER SHIRT
IS INAPPROPRIATE

10:57.257 --> 11:01.328
OR DISTRACTING TO YOU
OR WHATEVER THE HELL YOU SAID.
IT IS SEXIST!

11:01.428 --> 11:04.264
- IT'S COMPLETELY SEXIST.
- WE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT
TO A MAN

11:04.364 --> 11:05.833
IF-- IF THERE WAS MAN FLAB.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.168
- YEAH.
- A MAN WOULDN'T EVEN
DRESS LIKE THAT.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.303
WOMEN DRESS LIKE THAT.
THAT'S THE LOOK FOR THE...

11:10.403 --> 11:12.840
- ...YOUNG GIRLS.
- YEAH, FOR YOUR SWINGING,

11:12.940 --> 11:15.442
SEXY L.A. SCENE
THAT YOU LIVE IN.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.377
- WE DON'T LIVE IN THAT WORLD.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.579
HE LIVES IN LOS ANGELES.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.015
HE LIVES IN HIS OWN MIND.
HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.651
THE POINT IS THIS--
THERE'S LOTS OF MEN THAT
WE TALKED ABOUT HIRING

11:24.752 --> 11:27.287
- THAT WE WOULDN'T HIRE
FOR VARIOUS REASONS--
- ABSOLUTELY!

11:27.387 --> 11:29.890
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THE GUY
WE DIDN'T LIKE BECAUSE
HE WAS VEINY?

11:29.990 --> 11:32.092
- YEAH, THERE WAS
THE VEINY GUY.
- YEAH.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.694
THAT FIRST A.D.
FROM "EVENING SHADE"
HAD FOAMY MOUTH.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.831
- WE DIDN'T HIRE HIM.
- HE WAS BUBBLY. I CAN'T WORK
WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S BUBBLY.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.134
GUYS, I THINK YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
THAT MAUREEN'S MOTHER

11:41.234 --> 11:43.636
WAS OUR NANNY
FOR YEARS AND YEARS

11:43.737 --> 11:45.572
AND SHE HELPED ME
WITH THE GIRLS.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.209
OKAY, SHE IS VERY
MENTALLY UNSTABLE

11:49.309 --> 11:52.946
AND RIGHT NOW SHE'S GOING
THROUGH A VERY ROUGH TIME.
ALL RIGHT?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.315
HER DAUGHTER GETTING FIRED

11:55.415 --> 11:57.484
OR QUITTING OR WHATEVER
IT IS THAT HAPPENED,

11:57.584 --> 12:01.288
IT'S GONNA MAKE HER--
SHE COULD BE, LIKE, SUICIDAL.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.357
- SHE'S SUICIDAL?
- YOU'VE GOT TO GET MAUREEN
BACK HERE TO WORK.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.560
- OKAY? YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT.
- YOU REALLY SHOULD-- YOU SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF THIS, LARRY.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.997
YOU SHOULD.
YOU NEED TO DRIVE
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.099
- THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
THAT'S RIGHT.
- YEAH.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.034
( sighs )

12:15.368 --> 12:17.170
MAN.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.908
- SO JERRY AND I TALKED, AND--
- MM-HMM.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.110
--WE WANT YOU TO COME BACK.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.145
WANT YOU BACK.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.347
YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.282
YEAH.

12:29.382 --> 12:33.386
WELL, THE WHOLE REASON
WAS BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
OKAY WITH THIS SHIRT.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.923
HONESTLY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.225
I'M FINE WITH THE SHIRT.
I'M FINE WITH THE WHOLE THING.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.293
- THE WHOLE-- THE WHOLE--
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE WHOLE THING?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.362
- ALL THE WHOLE--
- WHAT IS THIS WHOLE THING?
WHAT IS THIS?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.497
YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING THERE,
I'M FINE WITH IT.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.899
MY STOMACH?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.868
YOU KNOW, THE PROTUBERANCE
AND THE WHOLE-- ALL OF IT.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.770
- SO WE'RE GOOD?
- I MEAN...

12:50.871 --> 12:52.940
IT'S A SIMPLE
THING, LARRY.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.175
- PERFECT WORLD?
- OKAY.

12:55.275 --> 12:59.079
MAYBE AN INCH FURTHER DOWN,
COVER UP THE BELLY BUTTON.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
THAT'S ALL.
PERFECT WORLD, PERFECT WORLD!

13:01.381 --> 13:04.184
I'D COVER
THAT LITTLE THING THERE,
THE LITTLE BELLY BUTTON.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.855
AN INCH LOWER.
YOU KNOW, BUT BELLY BUTTON
OR NO BELLY BUTTON,

13:07.955 --> 13:09.589
WE WANT YOU TO COME BACK.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.025
- OKAY.
- GOOD.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.361
- I'M GLAD WE TALKED, LARRY.
- ( door opens )

13:14.461 --> 13:16.229
- OH, HONEY.
- HI, MOM.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.366
HI, HONEY.
THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.401
OH NO.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.973
- MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?
- OH MY GOD.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.575
THIS IS MY BOSS.
THIS IS LARRY.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.878
NO, THIS IS NOT LARRY.
THIS-- YOU--

13:30.978 --> 13:33.046
YOU ARE THE SPITTING IMAGE

13:33.146 --> 13:35.515
OF MY DECEASED
HUSBAND TOM.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.584
OH MY GOD.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.153
OH, I'M HAVING A HOT FLASH.
OH HO HO.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.589
SERIOUSLY?
I REALLY LOOK LIKE THIS GUY?

13:42.689 --> 13:45.825
- OHHH.
- YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE HIM.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.660
WH-- WHAT-- WH--
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

13:47.760 --> 13:51.698
OH, IT HAPPENED SO FAST.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS MURDERED,
AND...

13:51.798 --> 13:53.000
- WE GOT MARRIED--
- MURDERED?!

13:53.100 --> 13:56.303
YES!
IT WAS 1962.

13:56.403 --> 14:01.374
IT WAS OUR WEDDING DAY.
WE WERE DRIVING DOWN TO MEXICO
FOR OUR HONEYMOON...

14:04.611 --> 14:07.747
( with radio )
* DON'T SAY NOTHING
BAD ABOUT MY BABY *

14:07.847 --> 14:11.684

14:29.536 --> 14:31.204
OHHH.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.074
- HAPPY, BABY?
- I'M SO HAPPY.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.743
YOU EVER THINK
YOU'D GET A GUY LIKE ME?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.412
NO. I DON'T THINK
MY MOM DID EITHER.

14:39.512 --> 14:43.650
YEAH.
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE SEX LATER?

14:44.851 --> 14:47.120
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT

14:47.220 --> 14:49.789
THAT I HAVE BEEN
FANTASIZING A LITTLE.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.192
- I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.
- YEAH?

14:52.292 --> 14:54.061
I DON'T THINK I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.429
( engine zooming )

14:56.529 --> 14:58.298
HEY!
( honking )

14:58.398 --> 15:00.333
- WHAT THE HELL?
- JUST LET HIM GO.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.569
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- JUST LET HIM GO.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.836
- HEY, SAME TO YOU!
- NO NO.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.172
- UH-HUH, YEAH!

15:05.272 --> 15:06.673
- PLEASE DON'T.
- JESUS, HUH?

15:06.773 --> 15:10.143
- DO NOT RUIN OUR PERFECT DAY.
- WHAT A SCHMOHAWK.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.412
- YOU BASTARD!
GO AHEAD, PULL OVER.
- JUST KEEP GOING.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.481
YOU DON'T PULL OVER.
JUST KEEP DRIVING.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.649
- PLEASE, DON'T GET IN A FIGHT.
- OKAY OKAY.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.019
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- PLEASE, JUST-- TOM!

15:19.119 --> 15:21.955
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
- WAIT HERE.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.324
( muffled chatter )

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
WAIT, HE'S BEHIND YOU!

15:34.734 --> 15:36.403
NO NO NO!

15:36.503 --> 15:38.271
- OH!

15:38.371 --> 15:39.939
LEARN HOW TO FUCKING DRIVE!

15:40.040 --> 15:41.741
( man laughs )

15:41.841 --> 15:43.343
LEARN HOW TO SPEED
THE HELL UP!

15:43.443 --> 15:46.179
* Bad about my baby,
oh no *

15:46.279 --> 15:49.182
* Don't say nothing
bad about my baby. *

15:49.282 --> 15:52.752
AND ALL HE DID WAS HONK!

15:52.852 --> 15:55.055
HE HONKED!

15:55.155 --> 15:57.190
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- IT IS.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.427
- YOU CAN'T HONK ANYMORE!
YOU CANNOT HONK.
- OH, NO NO.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.262
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE YOU CAN'T DO--
YOU CAN'T SHUSH.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.031
NO HONKING,
NO SHUSHING.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.832
THAT SOUND-- SHH-SHH,
YOU KNOW.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.168
- IT IS OFFENSIVE.
IT'S STARTLING.
- Maureen: IT'S AWFUL.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.936
BUT PEOPLE DON'T
KILL YOU FOR SHUSHING.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.871
- THEY KILL YOU FOR HONKING.
- THAT PART'S TRUE.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.441
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THE GROCERIES. LET ME
GET THESE OUT OF YOUR WAY.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.310
THANK YOU, DEAR.
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
A PICTURE OF TOM.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.613
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE.
IT'S UNCANNY.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.484
- COME ON, HMM?
- ( Larry scoffs )

16:24.584 --> 16:27.154
- YOU SEE IT, DON'T YOU?
- I'M SORRY TO SAY.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.190
- WHAT?
- HE DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE ME.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.126
- HONESTLY.
- LOOK, THE-- THE--

16:33.226 --> 16:35.295
THE HAIR,
THE GLASSES, EVERYTHING.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.332
- IT'S THE SAME. CONFIRM IT.
- ALL BALD PEOPLE DO NOT
LOOK ALIKE.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.634
I DON'T SEE HOW
YOU CANNOT SEE THAT.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.937
- MAY I USE YOUR BATHROOM?
- YEAH, SECOND DOOR
ON THE RIGHT.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.374
- OKAY.
- ( giggles )

16:54.947 --> 16:57.217
( urine gushing )

17:05.792 --> 17:07.627
( grunts )

17:13.433 --> 17:15.068
OH.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.198
- I'M JUST GONNA TAKE OFF.
- OH, HEY, LARRY.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.200
- HEY.
- HEY, I'M GLAD
WE HAD THAT TALK.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.535
- YES!
- I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.403
- OH, ME TOO, ME TOO.
- THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.939
- SO NICE MEETING YOU.
- YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.041
YOU KNOW, ABOUT
THE BARE MIDRIFF

17:55.142 --> 17:57.377
AND THE BELLY BUTTON.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.516
( phone rings )

18:05.952 --> 18:08.455
- HELLO?
- LARRY, IT'S THE INVISIBLE JEW.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.823
- RICHARD LEWIS, REMEMBER ME?
- Oh, hey!

18:10.923 --> 18:13.360
- YEAH.
- I cannot believe

18:13.460 --> 18:15.595
I GET INVITED TO LUNCH
WITH YOU AND JERRY.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.064
I'M STANDING THERE LIKE A PUTZ.
YOU DON'T EVEN--

18:18.165 --> 18:19.866
YOU DON'T EVEN
MAKE BELIEVE I'M THERE.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.101
What am I,
Marley's ghost?

18:22.202 --> 18:24.304
I AM SO SORRY.
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.239
I WAS COMPLETELY
IN THE WRONG THERE

18:26.339 --> 18:28.241
AND I TRULY APOLOGIZE.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.178
I'LL TELL YOU WHY I FELT
EVEN DOUBLY SHITTY,

18:31.278 --> 18:33.880
BECAUSE I WENT TO

YOU'RE ALWAYS--

20:06.539 --> 20:09.476

PHASE OF THE CALL?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.789
- TOTAL WIND-DOWN, YEAH.

AND "ALL RIGHT"?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.156
YEAH, I MEAN, THERE WAS
AN "ALL RIGHT."

THAT'S HALF A GOODBYE.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.131

20:45.478 --> 20:47.380
UM, DO I LOOK
DIFFERENT TO YOU?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.650
NO, I'M SEEING EVERYTHING
I USUALLY SEE.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.651
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.920
'CAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE
HAS CHANGED.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.756
YESTERDAY-- IT WAS ACTUALLY
RIGHT AFTER YOU LEFT,

20:56.856 --> 20:59.492
A MIRACLE HAPPENED.

20:59.592 --> 21:04.230
I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM
AND I CALLED MY MOTHER IN

21:04.331 --> 21:07.634
BECAUSE THERE IS A PAINTING
HANGING UP OF JESUS.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.201
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.504
AND HE'S GOT A TEAR

21:11.604 --> 21:14.173
COMING DOWN ON HIS FACE.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.242
- REALLY?
- A REAL TEAR

21:16.343 --> 21:20.179
THAT WAS NEVER
THERE BEFORE.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.114
- WOW.
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

21:22.214 --> 21:24.517
- THAT'S ODD.
- IT'S A MIRACLE!

21:24.617 --> 21:28.154
- HE CHOSE US.
- ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T...

21:28.254 --> 21:31.023
YOU KNOW, WATER?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.459
NO NO,
IT WAS AT EYE LEVEL.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.594
IT WAS-- THERE'S NO WAY
WATER COULD GET UP THERE.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.664
HAVE YOU EVER WITNESSED
A MIRACLE LIKE THAT?

21:37.764 --> 21:40.066
- NO.
- I MEAN, CAN YOU THINK
OF ONE LIKE THAT?

21:40.166 --> 21:42.602
I THINK EVERY ERECTION
IS A MIRACLE.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.938
ANYWAY, I'M SAD TO TELL
YOU GUYS THIS, BUT I...

21:46.038 --> 21:47.774
I HAVE TO QUIT.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.008

21:49.108 --> 21:51.578

21:51.678 --> 21:53.946
IT'S JUST MY MOTHER
AND I DECIDED AFTER SEEING IT

21:54.046 --> 21:55.982
WE CAN'T JUST KEEP IT
TO OURSELVES, YOU KNOW?

21:56.082 --> 21:58.618
WE'RE GOING TO GO AND BUY
AN R.V. AND TOUR THE COUNTRY

21:58.718 --> 22:02.288

OUR MIRACLE.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.623
- IT'S AMAZING.
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.425
AND WE CAN'T JUST KEEP IT
TO OURSELVES.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.093
- WE HAVE TO SHARE IT.
- Jerry: YOU HAVE TO.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.962
TRUST YOUR GUT,
YOU KNOW.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.164
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.233

29:02.008 --> 29:04.811
I THINK
IT'S COMING OVER HERE.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.745
- YOU HEAR IT, RIGHT?
- YES!

29:06.846 --> 29:09.916
- Mother: WOW, WHAT
THE HECK IS THAT?
- IT'S OVER HERE.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.886
- OH MY GOD.
- OH, HONEY, WHAT IS--
WHAT WAS THAT?

29:13.986 --> 29:15.788
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:15.888 --> 29:18.057
THE-- THE--
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
I-I--

29:18.157 --> 29:20.927
HOW DID THAT
EVEN GET UP HERE?
HOW DID THAT--

29:21.027 --> 29:23.395
- WHAT IS IT?
- OH MY GOD.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.432
- WHAT?
- THAT'S HOW JESUS--

29:26.532 --> 29:28.634
- THAT'S HOW--
- OH NO.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.669
- NO!
- OH NO, YOU DIDN'T.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.704
YOU DID NOT
DO THAT, LARRY!

29:32.805 --> 29:35.808
- ( gasps ) IT'S HORRIBLE.
- YOU KNOW, IT JUST GOES
UP IN THE...

29:35.908 --> 29:38.044
LARRY, YOU SPRAYED
ON JESUS!

29:38.144 --> 29:40.312
- ( stammers ) WHAT CAN I DO?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.949
I'M TAKING THIS MEDICATION
AND IT'S GETTING ALL
OVER THE PLACE!

29:43.049 --> 29:44.516
I CAN'T CONTROL IT!

29:44.616 --> 29:46.785
THE CHURCH GROUPS,
THE TOUR--

29:47.854 --> 29:49.922
THERE WAS
NO MIRACLE?

29:50.022 --> 29:52.424
- SORRY.
- MOM--

29:52.524 --> 29:53.926
MOM?

29:54.026 --> 29:56.762
WHERE DID SHE GO?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.597
- Larry: SHE WENT THAT WAY.
- WHERE DID SHE GO?!

29:58.697 --> 30:01.333
LARRY!
MOM?

30:01.433 --> 30:04.103
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO HER?
- LIKE, HOW FAR COULD
SHE HAVE GONE?

30:04.203 --> 30:05.337
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T GET IT.

30:05.437 --> 30:06.873
- MOM!
- MRS. COCHRAN!

30:06.973 --> 30:09.408
MOM?
LARRY.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.878

OH MY GOSH.

30:13.445 --> 30:16.215
- Larry: OH, CHRIST.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.232
OH NO!

30:33.332 --> 30:35.601
( all screaming )

30:37.736 --> 30:39.939
- ( groaning )
- LARRY.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.408
- OH, LARRY!
- ( gasping )

30:42.508 --> 30:44.610
HANG ON, LARRY.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.979

30:47.880 --> 30:51.217
