WEBVTT

00:02.684 --> 00:04.285
Hey!

00:04.319 --> 00:06.187
You know John from my office?

00:06.221 --> 00:07.521
The guy who built his own motorcycle?

00:07.556 --> 00:10.458
Oh, yeah. Is he out of the hospital yet?

00:10.492 --> 00:12.326
No. No.

00:12.361 --> 00:16.964
But his husband is the manager of the
Petting Zoo and he offered us a job.

00:17.032 --> 00:20.134
Okay, "A", I have a job.
And "B", I'm allergic to goats.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.572
So I'm gonna have to say, "nay-y-y".

00:24.606 --> 00:27.541
Well, "A", that's the sound a horse makes.

00:28.610 --> 00:31.379
And "B", the Petting Zoo is a cool new bar

00:31.413 --> 00:32.747
and they need shot girls
for Saturday nights.

00:32.781 --> 00:36.484
So all we have to do is wear cute
outfits and get guys to drink.

00:36.518 --> 00:40.221
Like we do on weekends
anyway, but now we'll get paid!

00:42.090 --> 00:43.924
I don't know. It sounds kind of sexist.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.192
I mean, why don't you just
throw us back to the '50s

00:45.227 --> 00:48.763
where women were stuck in the
kitchen slaving away for their men.

00:48.797 --> 00:50.131
Ooh, Josh's apple pie is done.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.068
So you're saying you don't want to do it?

00:54.102 --> 00:55.836
No, I told you it's degrading.

00:55.871 --> 00:57.538
Pay is 500 bucks each.

00:57.572 --> 00:58.773
Saturday, you say?

01:02.544 --> 01:04.278
Look at this one.

01:04.312 --> 01:06.313
It's black and huge.

01:09.317 --> 01:12.887
Wow, where would you
even put something so big?

01:19.761 --> 01:21.862
I'd make room for that.

01:21.897 --> 01:24.932
Guys, put the bathtub catalog down.

01:24.966 --> 01:26.801
I've already picked
out the tub for upstairs

01:26.835 --> 01:29.637
and before you ask, no, you may not.

01:29.671 --> 01:31.639
It's a surprise for Caroline, she's
gonna be the first one to use it.

01:31.673 --> 01:34.408
Don't worry, Yolanda. You'll
be the first one to clean it.

01:37.679 --> 01:40.347
All right, Elliot, what's our
game plan for Cooper Finley?

01:40.382 --> 01:42.083
Oh, what's a Cooper Finley?

01:42.117 --> 01:44.118
Is it a car? Can I have one?

01:44.152 --> 01:45.152
'Cause mine's mostly duct tape.

01:46.354 --> 01:48.255
Cooper Finley is a hacker

01:48.290 --> 01:52.026
that broke into Josh's new app
and forced it offline for two days.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.761
I went offline for two days,

01:53.795 --> 01:55.863
but that's because my neighbors
changed their wi-fi password.

01:58.633 --> 01:59.700
What are you gonna do to him?

01:59.734 --> 02:02.403
He left me no choice, I'm gonna hire him.

02:03.405 --> 02:04.605
Oh, yeah, that'll show him.

02:05.674 --> 02:07.408
Force him to work with Elliot every day.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.276
This kid is brilliant.

02:10.312 --> 02:13.047
He's only 23 years old and he
created this fuzzy logic data patch

02:13.081 --> 02:14.482
that I could develop
into software technology

02:14.516 --> 02:17.151
to piggyback off other signals creating
connections 10 times more stable.

02:20.755 --> 02:21.989
I made you a pie.

02:23.725 --> 02:27.761
I have to act fast. In six months, Yahoo
and Facebook will be all over this kid.

02:27.796 --> 02:30.631
So how do I impress a Maverick hacker?

02:30.665 --> 02:36.403
Well, just spitballing here,
but I'm thinking white limousine,

02:36.438 --> 02:38.639
bottle of bubbly, smooth jazz...

02:38.673 --> 02:43.244
And just as he signs the contract, a
single red rose falls from the moonroof.

02:43.278 --> 02:46.013
Yeah, I'm trying to sign
him not take him to prom.

02:51.052 --> 02:54.822
If you want my two cents, which
is all I have in my bank account,

02:54.856 --> 02:57.725
I'm thinking girls, booze...

02:57.759 --> 02:59.493
And?

02:59.528 --> 03:00.628
Oh, that's it. Girls and booze.

03:01.796 --> 03:03.797
Hey, why don't you guys
take him to the Petting Zoo?

03:03.865 --> 03:06.300
It's this hot new bar Sofia
and I are working on Saturday.

03:06.334 --> 03:07.301
Since when do you work at a bar?

03:07.335 --> 03:10.571
Since I found out parking tickets
triple when you don't pay them.

03:10.605 --> 03:14.074
Come, I'll get you guys on the V.I.P. List.

03:14.109 --> 03:16.243
Oh, please.

03:16.278 --> 03:19.313
You think a 23-year-old
computer genius

03:19.347 --> 03:22.249
is gonna work for you
because some half-naked girls

03:22.284 --> 03:24.185
shake their boobies in his face?

03:27.822 --> 03:30.858
Saturday, you say?

03:35.478 --> 03:38.628
<b>Sync and corrected by<font color="#ff8000"> thatjulio</font>
www.addic7ed.com</b>

03:43.038 --> 03:45.940
See? This isn't demeaning.

03:45.974 --> 03:47.875
Here's 50 bucks, keep 'em coming.

03:47.909 --> 03:50.044
More like de-mazing.

03:51.913 --> 03:52.980
Pretty cool place, huh?

03:53.014 --> 03:56.817
It was not easy getting us on the list.

03:56.851 --> 03:57.952
Really? Why?

03:57.986 --> 04:00.710
All you have to do is bypass
their firewall, hack their server,

04:00.711 --> 04:02.662
and put your name in the employee database.

04:03.024 --> 04:03.991
How'd you do it?

04:04.025 --> 04:06.160
I asked a girl I know.

04:06.194 --> 04:08.095
Hey, Gabi.

04:08.129 --> 04:11.699
Did someone koala my name?

04:11.733 --> 04:13.734
Gabi, this is Cooper. Cooper, Gabi.

04:13.768 --> 04:15.002
- She works for me.
- Hi.

04:15.036 --> 04:16.837
You have your own shot girl?

04:16.870 --> 04:18.872
Wow, you are rich.

04:18.906 --> 04:21.007
And you could be too.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.776
How'd you like to come work for me?

04:22.811 --> 04:25.045
What? Are you offering me a job?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.815
Yeah, he thinks you're highly koala-fied.

04:27.849 --> 04:29.883
Stop doing that.

04:29.918 --> 04:31.151
- You're funny.
- Keep doing that.

04:31.186 --> 04:34.021
Who wants some al-koala-hol?

04:38.860 --> 04:39.827
What are you doing in there?

04:39.861 --> 04:41.028
Hey.

04:41.062 --> 04:43.063
Oh, the piggy's on a break.

04:43.098 --> 04:46.734
He went, "wee wee wee" all
the way to the bathroom.

04:48.136 --> 04:50.804
So, Coop, are you gonna
come work for me, or what?

04:50.839 --> 04:55.876
Normally I'd say I'd never go mainstream
and work for a rich, corporate sellout.

04:55.910 --> 04:58.746
But now I'm saying, hell to the yizz-ee.

04:58.780 --> 05:00.014
Yes!

05:00.048 --> 05:02.082
Aw, let's capture this moment.

05:03.785 --> 05:05.853
Oh, shoot, it's doing that thing again.

05:05.887 --> 05:07.955
Gabs, I told you to take
it to the genius bar.

05:07.989 --> 05:10.124
Well, lucky for you, we're in a bar

05:10.158 --> 05:12.159
and I'm a genius.

05:12.193 --> 05:13.894
I already tried, there's
nothing you can do.

05:13.928 --> 05:15.796
Well, maybe there's nothing you can do,

05:15.830 --> 05:19.733
but we both know that your
code isn't exactly elegant.

05:19.768 --> 05:23.137
My code is so elegant, it
summers in the south of France.

05:23.171 --> 05:27.741
Oh, is that the new vacation
spot for sub-standard programming?

05:27.776 --> 05:28.909
All fixed.

05:28.943 --> 05:32.880
Wow, Josh, look. Cooper fixed my phone
and he set my home screen to a koala.

05:32.914 --> 05:34.548
Sub-standard?

05:34.582 --> 05:37.551
That's funny, "Wired" didn't mention that
when they did a cover story on me.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.386
Oh, "Wired"...

05:39.421 --> 05:42.289
That cutting-edge magazine that
still prints their copies on paper.

05:43.558 --> 05:46.327
- Shoot.
- I am so sorry.

05:46.361 --> 05:49.997
My hand-eye coordination
is severely compromised.

05:50.031 --> 05:53.167
But your hand-boob
coordination is dead on.

05:53.201 --> 05:55.135
Take it easy, dad.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.136
I'm just trying to help her.

05:56.171 --> 05:57.805
All right, Coop, come on, back off.

05:57.839 --> 05:58.939
No, what's your problem.

05:58.973 --> 06:00.007
Hey, hands off.

06:00.041 --> 06:01.642
Hands off me.

06:03.945 --> 06:05.479
Oh, my God.

06:05.513 --> 06:06.447
Cooper, are you okay?

06:06.481 --> 06:07.581
I'm fine.

06:09.384 --> 06:10.451
How do you feel?

06:10.485 --> 06:13.287
You just hit a smaller guy with glasses.

06:13.321 --> 06:14.455
And anemia.

06:21.692 --> 06:24.494
I'm so hungover I hear pounding.

06:24.528 --> 06:28.498
Relax, baby, we all hear it.

06:28.532 --> 06:29.766
It's the man working on your tub.

06:31.369 --> 06:32.502
Hey, thanks for the iced tea.

06:32.536 --> 06:33.603
It's not for you.

06:35.206 --> 06:37.340
I'm working on the man working on your tub.

06:40.511 --> 06:44.114
Hey, Josh, I made you my
patented hangover helper.

06:44.148 --> 06:46.883
Ugh, just looking at it makes me sick.

06:46.918 --> 06:48.118
Good, I'm starving.

06:50.755 --> 06:52.789
So in regards to what happened last night,

06:52.823 --> 06:56.660
Gabi made these cute "Star Wars"
apology treats for Cooper.

06:56.694 --> 06:58.795
Just something for him to Chewbacca on.

07:00.665 --> 07:04.367
All you have to do is sign this card,
and we can send it right over.

07:05.469 --> 07:08.238
"May the force and my apology be with you".

07:09.440 --> 07:10.473
I'm not signing this.

07:10.508 --> 07:12.042
He was acting like a douche.

07:12.076 --> 07:13.143
A douchey genius.

07:13.177 --> 07:14.144
Look, I don't care how
much money's at stake.

07:14.178 --> 07:15.211
A billion dollars!

07:15.246 --> 07:16.913
- Isn't Gabi's honor worth...
- nothing!

07:21.852 --> 07:23.119
I can't believe Josh.

07:23.154 --> 07:26.056
Throwing a huge business deal over nothing.

07:26.090 --> 07:28.925
I could really use a soak.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.560
Oh, no, you don't.

07:30.594 --> 07:34.497
Josh was very clear, no one is to
use this tub until Caroline gets back.

07:34.532 --> 07:36.666
Now let's get out of here before
one of us does something stupid.

07:37.668 --> 07:39.202
You first.

07:39.236 --> 07:40.170
No, you.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:51.983 --> 07:54.017
Cooper, it's Gabi.

07:54.051 --> 07:56.786
Making a house koala.

07:58.889 --> 08:00.857
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:00.891 --> 08:02.692
How's your chin?

08:02.727 --> 08:04.661
I don't know, I don't
have health insurance.

08:04.695 --> 08:07.697
But Web M.D. says I
might have lyme disease.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.367
What are you doing here?

08:10.401 --> 08:14.137
Oh, I'm delivering these
marshmallow treats from Josh.

08:14.171 --> 08:17.307
He had me shape them into little R2-D2S
to say he's sorry for empire striking you.

08:17.341 --> 08:18.942
Back.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.343
They look great.

08:20.378 --> 08:23.146
I can't wait to be able to chew them.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.914
- Wanna come in?
- Sure.

08:25.950 --> 08:27.717
Sorry it's such a mess.

08:27.752 --> 08:30.687
Listen, Josh wants to apologize for
that whole fist bump to the face thing

08:30.721 --> 08:31.921
and have you over for dinner tonight.

08:31.956 --> 08:32.922
Seriously?

08:32.957 --> 08:34.524
Yeah.

08:34.558 --> 08:35.725
Why, does it sound made
up? 'Cause it's not.

08:37.395 --> 08:41.297
Actually, I'm the one that
needs to apologize to you.

08:41.332 --> 08:44.267
I remember spilling something
and trying to clean it up

08:44.301 --> 08:45.435
and touching a part of you.

08:45.469 --> 08:47.170
Yeah, actually two parts.

08:47.204 --> 08:48.405
I'm really sorry.

08:48.439 --> 08:50.373
And I was thinking about it last night.

08:50.408 --> 08:54.110
I wanted to make it up to you,
and so I bought you something.

08:54.145 --> 08:56.212
Oh, you didn't have to get me anything.

08:56.247 --> 08:58.048
I got you a domain name.

08:58.082 --> 09:00.683
"Bon Gabetit".

09:00.718 --> 09:03.086
You're gonna need a website when
you're a famous chef someday.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.724
Oh, my God, I have always
wanted my own dot com.

09:07.758 --> 09:08.892
That's so...

09:08.926 --> 09:11.728
wow, nobody has ever done
anything like that for me.

09:13.531 --> 09:15.231
Listen, uh, Cooper.

09:15.266 --> 09:16.666
You and I are really not that different.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.401
Well, that's true.

09:18.436 --> 09:20.270
We are both carbon-based life-forms.

09:21.305 --> 09:22.372
Okay, maybe a little different.

09:24.075 --> 09:26.242
But you know, we're both living our dream.

09:26.277 --> 09:30.113
I wanna be the next Julia Child
and, uh... you wanna be the next...

09:30.147 --> 09:32.015
Computer visionary, Jean Bartik.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.049
- Yeah, him.
- Her.

09:33.084 --> 09:34.184
Her.

09:34.218 --> 09:37.987
The only difference is,
I'm already living my dream.

09:38.022 --> 09:40.523
I'm working for this great
guy who believes in me

09:40.558 --> 09:42.459
and the same guy believes in you too.

09:42.493 --> 09:44.694
So come over for dinner
tonight and let him apologize.

09:44.728 --> 09:47.464
'Cause, Cooper, I mean
this in the nicest way,

09:47.498 --> 09:48.731
but what else you got going on tonight?

09:52.236 --> 09:53.203
- Good point.
- Yeah.

09:57.408 --> 09:59.242
Oh, look who's finally up.

09:59.276 --> 10:01.211
You must be feeling better.

10:01.245 --> 10:02.846
I can't wait to eat.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.114
I'm actually excited to hold food down.

10:06.050 --> 10:07.183
Good, because we're having company.

10:07.218 --> 10:09.085
- We are?

10:09.120 --> 10:11.921
Yes, and now would be a great time

10:11.956 --> 10:14.724
to tell you that it's
Cooper. Don't get mad.

10:14.758 --> 10:16.826
He's here to apologize for
what happened the other night

10:16.861 --> 10:21.631
and I'm sure you have a lot of questions,
but they can all be answered by... Cooper!

10:22.700 --> 10:24.334
Hey, Gabi.

10:25.736 --> 10:27.303
Josh.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.041
I just want to say I
think it's very big of you

10:32.076 --> 10:34.210
to invite me over here
in person to apologize.

10:34.245 --> 10:36.246
Uh, I didn't invite you over here.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.047
Who's hungry?

10:41.018 --> 10:42.752
You're not gonna apologize to me?

10:42.786 --> 10:43.853
Are you out of your mind?

10:43.888 --> 10:44.821
Probably.

10:44.855 --> 10:47.557
Due to the brain damage from
when you punched me in the face.

10:48.692 --> 10:49.792
Hey! Hey hey hey.

10:49.827 --> 10:54.731
Everyone's gonna feel a lot better
when they eat my delicious nachos!

10:57.234 --> 10:59.169
Ta-da!

10:59.203 --> 11:00.270
Nachos.

11:02.239 --> 11:03.339
This whole thing was a setup?

11:05.242 --> 11:06.976
Gabi, did you actually
think you can trick him

11:07.011 --> 11:08.311
into coming over here, not tell me,

11:08.345 --> 11:10.113
and that everything would
be okay because you made...

11:10.147 --> 11:11.848
Nachos?!

11:14.818 --> 11:15.985
A little bit.

11:17.588 --> 11:18.988
Guys, just apologize, okay?

11:19.023 --> 11:20.657
It's not that hard.

11:20.691 --> 11:21.658
Watch.

11:21.692 --> 11:24.594
Cooper, I'm sorry I tricked
you into coming to dinner.

11:24.628 --> 11:26.496
Josh, I'm sorry I dented
your hybrid corvette.

11:26.530 --> 11:27.530
You what?!

11:27.565 --> 11:29.299
Let's just stay on track.

11:30.601 --> 11:33.403
Cooper, you got drunk and
you touched some stuff.

11:33.437 --> 11:36.039
Josh, you got drunk and
you punched some stuff.

11:37.374 --> 11:40.977
Look, Josh, I don't remember what was said,

11:41.011 --> 11:44.113
but obviously it was bad
enough for you to punch me.

11:45.716 --> 11:46.916
So for that, I'm sorry.

11:46.951 --> 11:48.952
That'll do. Josh?

11:50.621 --> 11:51.588
Apology accepted.

11:57.328 --> 11:59.462
I'm sorry I punched the
glasses off your face.

12:02.499 --> 12:04.334
Good enough.

12:04.368 --> 12:06.469
Okay, now for the good part... nachos.

12:08.172 --> 12:12.242
So, Josh, I was wondering is
that job offer still on the table?

12:14.211 --> 12:15.878
Well...

12:15.913 --> 12:17.947
My gut told me to hire
you in the first place

12:18.015 --> 12:20.883
and I always go with
it, so the offer stands.

12:20.918 --> 12:21.985
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:22.019 --> 12:23.786
Yes!

12:23.821 --> 12:25.755
Oh, my God. My nachos are magic.

12:28.726 --> 12:29.892
Thanks for going with your gut, man.

12:29.927 --> 12:32.662
Hey, man, you gotta listen to
it. It will never steer you wrong.

12:32.696 --> 12:35.732
Well, I'm gonna take your
advice on that one, boss.

12:38.369 --> 12:39.535
Gabi, will you go out with me?

12:43.274 --> 12:44.374
Wow, uh...

12:44.408 --> 12:49.245
Cooper, you're super cute and sweet,
but I'm kind of on the spot here.

12:50.914 --> 12:52.148
Let me help everybody out here.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.820
I know Gabi, and I think
what she's trying to say is

12:57.855 --> 12:58.988
- no.
- Yes.

13:00.624 --> 13:01.624
- What?
- What?

13:05.295 --> 13:07.996
Would you mind taking those nachos
on the terrace, just for a minute?

13:08.031 --> 13:08.964
Sure.

13:12.535 --> 13:13.601
Okay.

13:13.636 --> 13:15.403
Why did you say I couldn't go out with him?

13:15.438 --> 13:17.439
I'm about to get in bed
with him on a business deal.

13:17.473 --> 13:19.541
If you actually get into bed with
him, this could be a disaster.

13:19.575 --> 13:22.077
Why are you being so negative?

13:22.111 --> 13:24.112
Because I remember this one time
when someone in this apartment

13:24.146 --> 13:25.280
slept with someone she
worked with in this apartment,

13:25.314 --> 13:27.048
and it was super awkward and it was us.

13:28.184 --> 13:30.185
Josh, that was so last month.

13:30.219 --> 13:31.186
Okay, what we had was totally diff...

13:32.188 --> 13:34.089
Can I get something to drink?

13:34.123 --> 13:35.857
Absolutely.

13:35.891 --> 13:38.526
It's just a first date, okay?

13:38.561 --> 13:41.463
He's kinda cute and kinda
funny and I kinda wanna say yes.

13:41.497 --> 13:42.731
Well, I'm kinda putting my foot down.

13:42.765 --> 13:45.433
Okay, I think you are being a little un...

13:45.501 --> 13:46.534
Here you go.

13:46.569 --> 13:48.536
Reasonable about this.

13:48.571 --> 13:49.637
The answer is no.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.307
Fine.

13:52.341 --> 13:53.475
I mean not fine.

13:53.509 --> 13:56.077
But you're my boss and
I have to respect that.

13:56.112 --> 13:57.345
So I will not go out with him.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.380
Thank you.

14:05.187 --> 14:06.888
Guys?

14:09.024 --> 14:10.859
Really cold out here.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.865
Who made up this rule that you
can't date anybody you work with?

14:16.899 --> 14:20.668
Uh, thousands of companies
all across the country.

14:20.703 --> 14:22.437
And how do you even know you like Cooper?

14:22.505 --> 14:24.472
- You just met him.
- I know, it's so weird.

14:24.507 --> 14:25.607
He was just this computer guy,

14:25.641 --> 14:28.643
but then all of a sudden
he was sweet and thoughtful

14:28.677 --> 14:32.514
and he bought me a domain. And now I
have this little feeling on the inside.

14:32.548 --> 14:35.183
Well, let me crush it for you.

14:35.217 --> 14:38.186
One hundred percent of your
relationships have failed.

14:38.220 --> 14:41.790
I know, and I just wanted a
chance to let this one fail too.

14:41.824 --> 14:44.692
Okay, you clearly need to
get this out of your system.

14:44.727 --> 14:45.927
So...

14:45.961 --> 14:46.995
I got it.

14:47.029 --> 14:48.596
Go on a date with him

14:48.631 --> 14:50.632
and instead of, like,
being all fake and charming

14:50.666 --> 14:51.933
like most couples are at the beginning,

14:51.967 --> 14:53.802
tell each other all your worst qualities.

14:54.804 --> 14:57.572
Nothing kills a relationship like honesty.

14:58.641 --> 14:59.607
Oh, my God, that's brilliant.

14:59.642 --> 15:02.243
Once he gets to know the real me,
he'll just go running for the hills.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.411
Just like all the others.

15:03.446 --> 15:04.379
Nailed it.

15:07.550 --> 15:10.018
Okay, so we're here tonight
to get to know each other

15:10.052 --> 15:12.253
and find out that we
do not like each other.

15:12.288 --> 15:16.925
Okay, I understand quantum
physics, but this is confusing.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.159
What if we do like each other?

15:18.194 --> 15:19.828
Oh, we won't.

15:19.862 --> 15:21.029
But on the off chance that we do.

15:21.063 --> 15:22.764
We'll deal with it later.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.699
So let's get this train wreck started.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.701
I will tell you something about
myself that you're gonna hate.

15:26.735 --> 15:27.902
Go for it.

15:27.937 --> 15:29.704
Um, okay, I talk a lot.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.473
I don't know, it's sort of a nervous habit.

15:31.507 --> 15:32.607
I've kind of done it
since I was a little girl.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.675
I just kind of go on and on and on...

15:33.709 --> 15:36.211
No, I get it.

15:36.245 --> 15:38.112
But I have to say I think it's really cute.

15:38.147 --> 15:40.014
No, no, you're not supposed to like it.

15:40.049 --> 15:42.150
Okay, well how about I tell
you something horrible about me?

15:42.184 --> 15:43.985
- Okay, bring it.
- I can't remember the last time

15:44.019 --> 15:45.320
I washed these jeans. May never have.

15:47.089 --> 15:49.891
I lick the powder off donuts
and put them back in the box.

15:51.026 --> 15:52.026
I have a suit of armor.

15:53.696 --> 15:55.563
I have a fake Facebook
account where I'm a cat.

15:55.598 --> 15:58.766
I think there's a sixty percent
chance that we're living in the matrix.

15:59.902 --> 16:01.736
Damn it, this is going really great.

16:01.770 --> 16:04.639
Um, okay, I gotta think
of something horrible.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.341
Oh, ooh, yay!

16:06.375 --> 16:08.643
I'm so irresponsible, I
forgot to pay my electric bill.

16:11.347 --> 16:12.547
Can I tell you something?

16:12.581 --> 16:14.148
- Only if it's bad.
- It is.

16:16.051 --> 16:18.052
Now that I know all of these
horrible things about you,

16:18.087 --> 16:20.121
I like you even more.

16:21.223 --> 16:22.257
Crap.

16:29.064 --> 16:32.834
Why are you reading the
owner's manual for the new tub?

16:34.737 --> 16:36.671
So I know how to clean...

16:36.705 --> 16:41.409
A combination of 14 pulsating, rotating
and directional adjustable jets.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.148
Keep walking, nothing to see here.

16:55.324 --> 16:56.991
Hey, Coop, thanks for coming by.

16:57.026 --> 16:58.326
- Sure.
- I'm just about to go on my morning run.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.994
But I'll go get your contract for you.

17:00.029 --> 17:01.129
This is exciting.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.231
Wait wait, how... how
long you running for today?

17:05.134 --> 17:06.768
Today I'm gonna try for 10 miles.

17:06.801 --> 17:08.869
H-h-how... what's that in minutes?

17:08.904 --> 17:10.771
Oh, about 90 minutes.

17:10.806 --> 17:12.740
Damn, that's im... that's impressive.

17:16.545 --> 17:18.680
Hey, Cooper, we should probably talk...

17:18.714 --> 17:19.747
- I know.
- About something.

17:19.781 --> 17:22.317
Look, I really don't think it's
a good idea for us to go out.

17:22.351 --> 17:23.651
Oh, thank God. I totally agree.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.587
What? I thought you liked me.

17:25.621 --> 17:27.355
Like you?

17:27.388 --> 17:30.158
I hacked into the power company last
night and paid your electric bill.

17:30.192 --> 17:31.426
Yay.

17:31.460 --> 17:35.129
But this job is a huge opportunity
and I just don't want to blow it.

17:35.164 --> 17:36.998
I get it, absolutely.

17:37.032 --> 17:38.066
It's the right thing to do.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.033
Yeah.

17:39.068 --> 17:40.134
Friends?

17:40.169 --> 17:41.636
Friends.

17:44.840 --> 17:45.773
Big mistake!

17:46.976 --> 17:48.676
I totally forgot your contract in my car.

17:48.711 --> 17:49.744
I'll go get it for you.

17:55.517 --> 17:58.586
It's approximately a two-minute elevator
ride from the penthouse to the garage.

17:58.621 --> 18:00.321
Why are you telling me this?

18:02.558 --> 18:04.325
Josh, where are you?

18:04.360 --> 18:05.460
Come on.

18:13.202 --> 18:14.836
Josh?

18:20.142 --> 18:22.610
Yolanda, are you getting in that tub?

18:22.645 --> 18:24.579
Josh, what are you doing in your bathroom?

18:24.613 --> 18:26.814
What are you doing in my bathroom?

18:26.849 --> 18:29.584
There is a real good
reason why I'm in here.

18:29.618 --> 18:30.718
I was...

18:30.753 --> 18:32.487
About to clean it for Caroline.

18:32.521 --> 18:34.389
Why do you think it's filled
with scrubbing bubbles?

18:34.423 --> 18:36.190
So why are you in a robe?

18:36.225 --> 18:39.093
In case I fall in.

18:39.128 --> 18:40.294
Think.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.496
Well, I need you downstairs.

18:41.530 --> 18:43.965
Okay, fine.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.033
I'll be down in 45.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.067
Now!

18:52.041 --> 18:55.043
Okay, this is getting too complicated.

18:55.077 --> 18:56.911
There's only one thing that we can do.

18:56.945 --> 18:59.080
To keep dating and not tell Josh?

18:59.114 --> 19:00.648
You are a genius.

19:06.403 --> 19:09.371
Okay, Josh, have a safe trip.

19:09.406 --> 19:10.539
I'm leaving now.

19:10.574 --> 19:12.408
Bye-bye.

19:13.410 --> 19:14.577
And hello.

19:23.019 --> 19:25.221
Hey, Josh. Have a good flight.

19:25.255 --> 19:27.156
I'm leaving now.

19:27.190 --> 19:28.157
Night-night.

19:30.327 --> 19:34.830
Bathtub app, here we go.

19:35.899 --> 19:38.100
Music... on.

19:38.134 --> 19:41.270
Mood lighting... on.

19:41.304 --> 19:45.043
Water... hot. Hot, hot!

20:05.028 --> 20:07.897
Yolanda, what are you doing here?!

20:07.931 --> 20:09.131
What do you think I'm doing?!

20:09.165 --> 20:11.200
Well, you have to get out.

20:11.234 --> 20:12.935
Hell no.

20:12.969 --> 20:15.037
I was here first, you get out.

20:15.071 --> 20:16.906
Well, I'm not moving.

20:16.940 --> 20:17.907
Neither am I.

20:23.346 --> 20:25.948
Are these vanilla bath salts?

20:27.017 --> 20:29.184
Vanilla peach.

20:29.219 --> 20:31.253
Is that champagne?

20:35.707 --> 20:39.247
To never telling anyone about this.

20:39.248 --> 20:41.256
Cheers to that.

20:45.321 --> 20:46.840
Turn on the jets.
