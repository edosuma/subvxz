01:12.600 --> 01:15.649
<i>If you'd have asked me in 1973
if I believed in miracles,</i>

01:15.760 --> 01:18.570
<i>I'd have said absolutely not.</i>

01:18.680 --> 01:20.603
<i>I'd have told you
it's a brutal world out there,</i>

01:20.680 --> 01:22.205
<i>and my only comfort in it</i>

01:22.280 --> 01:24.726
<i>is that I am the master
of my own fate.</i>

01:24.800 --> 01:27.804
<i>I'm the captain of my soul.</i>

01:27.880 --> 01:30.531
<i>Some call what happened
here a miracle,</i>

01:30.600 --> 01:33.285
<i>and there is only
one explanation,</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:37.331
<i>only one way any of this
could've happened.</i>

01:54.120 --> 01:56.043
<i>In the city of Birmingham,</i>

01:56.120 --> 01:58.851
<i>the Department of Justice
some time ago</i>

01:58.920 --> 02:01.287
<i>instituted an investigation,</i>

02:01.360 --> 02:05.410
<i>an attack on the city's
segregation ordinance.</i>

02:05.520 --> 02:09.445
<i>I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

02:09.520 --> 02:12.808
Some very, very good friends
of mine were killed by bombs,

02:12.880 --> 02:16.965
<i>bombs that were
planted by racists.</i>

02:17.040 --> 02:19.964
<i>I remember,
from the time I was very small,</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:23.681
<i>I remember the sounds of bombs
exploding across the street,</i>

02:23.760 --> 02:25.410
our house shaking.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.491
<i>So what do you expect
with that type of injustice?</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:33.642
We are angry.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.882
<i>They killed Kennedy. They killed King.</i>

02:35.960 --> 02:37.530
<i>They killed Evers.</i>

02:37.600 --> 02:41.491
<i>I don't think there is
much of a future at this point.</i>

02:41.560 --> 02:43.130
<i>Not much at all.</i>

02:43.200 --> 02:45.487
They're just killing
everybody that wanna...

02:45.600 --> 02:47.568
For the nation itself.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.088
<i>The true picture of
what goes on here</i>

02:50.160 --> 02:51.764
<i>can even be seen
in American television.</i>

02:51.840 --> 02:54.491
<i>If you look at it long enough,
the emptiness,</i>

02:54.560 --> 02:58.690
the spiritual bleakness,
the loss of meaning,

02:58.760 --> 03:00.330
<i>the loss of purpose.</i>

03:00.400 --> 03:02.926
<i>There's no unity in the world.</i>

03:03.000 --> 03:06.561
<i>You couldn't rally 500 people
to sincerely fight</i>

03:06.640 --> 03:08.483
<i>for the same common cause,</i>

03:08.560 --> 03:12.246
<i>no matter what that cause
might be, unless it's dollars.</i>

03:12.320 --> 03:13.924
The result of this is,
of course,

03:14.000 --> 03:15.525
the chaos that we live in.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.284
<i>They set fire to the country.</i>

03:17.360 --> 03:21.081
Get ridiculed, and you know,
discriminated, you know,

03:21.160 --> 03:22.764
and be less than a man.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.649
I don't think
it's right, you know?

03:24.720 --> 03:28.247
<i>I draw the line in
the dust and toss the gauntlet</i>

03:28.320 --> 03:30.288
<i>before the feet of tyranny,</i>

03:30.360 --> 03:35.002
<i>and I say segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,</i>

03:35.080 --> 03:37.526
<i>and segregation forever.</i>

04:14.720 --> 04:16.404
<i>It's a sad day here in Birmingham,</i>

04:16.480 --> 04:17.845
<i>a heartbreaking day,</i>

04:17.920 --> 04:20.048
<i>the Crimson Tide
about to be defeated</i>

04:20.120 --> 04:22.282
<i>by the Trojans
of Southern Cal</i>

04:22.360 --> 04:25.887
<i>and their stellar tailback,
Sam "Bam" Cunningham.</i>

04:25.960 --> 04:30.966
<i>A tough loss for
the Alabama Crimson Tide.</i>

04:36.000 --> 04:37.525
What happened, Coach?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.728
We just got the stew
beat out of us by USC.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.365
You weren't paying attention?

04:41.440 --> 04:43.169
Why'd you bring USC
to Birmingham?

04:43.240 --> 04:44.844
Trying to make some
sort of statement?

04:44.920 --> 04:47.002
That's it, son.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.848
We have a visitor.

04:59.920 --> 05:06.644
<i>Gentlemen, if wanting to win is a fault,</i>

05:06.720 --> 05:09.485
then I plead guilty.
I like to win.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.528
<i>Know no other way.</i>

05:11.600 --> 05:15.047
It's in my blood.

05:15.120 --> 05:21.241
When I get beat, which
is gonna happen occasionally,

05:21.320 --> 05:27.566
I like it to be by an opponent
worthy of my respect.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.604
<i>Fine game, son.</i>

05:34.680 --> 05:36.250
Thank you, sir.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.641
Brave of you to play it.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.530
Thank y'all
for coming down here.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.570
Where you been, Coach?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.723
Talking to a real
football player.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.723
Time and a place
for everything.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.246
Ain't that what
the Good Book says?

06:42.960 --> 06:45.600
<i>In memory of the 10-year
anniversary of the bombing</i>

06:45.640 --> 06:48.769
<i>of the 16th Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham,</i>

06:48.840 --> 06:52.128
<i>here's the late
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</i>

06:52.200 --> 06:54.851
<i>What murdered these four girls?</i>

06:54.920 --> 06:58.720
<i>The apathy and the complacency
of many Negro</i>

06:58.800 --> 07:02.407
<i>who will sit down on
their stools and do nothing</i>

07:02.480 --> 07:04.767
<i>and not engage
in creative protests</i>

07:04.840 --> 07:07.286
<i>to get rid
of this evil system.</i>

07:30.880 --> 07:32.291
Tell your mom
I'll be home late.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.491
Nobody forcing you to play.
You know that, right?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.130
You sound like Mama now.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.964
She just don't
wanna see you get hurt.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.008
That's just natural.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.082
Hey, Tony.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.204
Where you live from?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.490
Love you, boy.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.966
<i>I'm frustrated all the
time by what I see,</i>

08:34.039 --> 08:38.250
And wonder when it'll end
and if it ever will end.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.565
What do you think?

08:47.640 --> 08:49.768
It's unbelievable.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.041
What's the name
of the school?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.804
Woodlawn.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.208
<i>Listen up, guys. Listen up.</i>

09:17.280 --> 09:19.647
<i>Morton.</i>

09:19.720 --> 09:21.643
<i>Allyson.</i>

09:21.720 --> 09:24.564
<i>Parker.</i>

09:24.640 --> 09:26.290
<i>Parker?</i>

09:39.920 --> 09:41.922
<i>Anger.</i>

09:43.360 --> 09:45.362
<i>I see it in your faces.</i>

09:47.560 --> 09:51.451
<i>You're angry because of what's
happened to this school.</i>

09:54.720 --> 09:56.722
You've been berated...

09:57.640 --> 09:59.642
...or beaten...

10:00.880 --> 10:02.882
...or shot at.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.001
<i>So have I.</i>

10:06.080 --> 10:08.082
<i>None of us chose this.</i>

10:08.160 --> 10:09.969
<i>It was forced on us.</i>

10:10.040 --> 10:14.045
<i>But we can choose together
what we will do with it.</i>

10:14.120 --> 10:16.805
<i>So, if it is anger
that unites us,</i>

10:16.880 --> 10:19.884
<i>then let's use that anger
to win, boys.</i>

10:22.800 --> 10:28.364
'Cause winning fixes just
about everything, doesn't it?

10:28.480 --> 10:31.529
Are there any questions?

10:33.520 --> 10:35.807
I didn't think so.
Let's go do it.

10:37.520 --> 10:42.367
<i>♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪</i>

10:42.440 --> 10:45.603
<i>♪ Where the skies are so blue ♪</i>

10:45.680 --> 10:47.808
It's not that hot out here, boy.
Come on, let's go!

10:47.880 --> 10:52.169
<i>♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪</i>

10:52.240 --> 10:55.210
<i>♪ Lord, I'm coming home
to you ♪</i>

11:02.880 --> 11:05.884
Stay down, boy.
You don't belong.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.491
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:21.560 --> 11:23.608
<i>That's my boy!</i>

11:23.680 --> 11:25.444
- You see that?
- I'm right here, Jerry.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.090
<i>Hey, it's okay, cupcake.</i>

11:27.160 --> 11:28.685
That was just Superman
flying over your head.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.330
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

11:30.400 --> 11:32.050
Watch your mouth, boy!

11:33.160 --> 11:34.685
Hey! Hey!
That's enough!

11:34.760 --> 11:36.922
Suicides, everybody,
thanks to you two.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Let's go.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.771
<i>Look at the man beside you.</i>

11:40.840 --> 11:43.764
<i>This is what happens when
you fight against each other</i>

11:43.840 --> 11:45.968
<i>instead of fighting
to be a team.</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:56.804
You shower when we're done,
Superman.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.963
<i>Over, under, through, and tie.</i>

12:07.080 --> 12:08.889
<i>Let me help you.</i>

12:08.960 --> 12:10.530
I don't wanna go.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.364
<i>It's okay.</i>

12:12.440 --> 12:14.681
Your school is
not like my school.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.410
Will it ever be?

12:18.480 --> 12:20.289
<i>Over, under, through.</i>

12:20.360 --> 12:21.486
Ready?

12:21.560 --> 12:22.721
<i>Yes sir.</i>

12:22.800 --> 12:24.404
Let's go.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.564
<i>See ya, buddy.</i>

12:59.720 --> 13:01.324
Mornin'.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.164
In whose world?

13:05.720 --> 13:12.046
<i>I am Coach Gerelds.</i>

13:12.120 --> 13:16.091
I love football and not science,
so please pay attention

13:16.160 --> 13:19.050
while I give you
all the answers.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.770
<i>Okay, let's get started.</i>

13:20.840 --> 13:22.683
Hey, you gonna quit?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.410
Why?

13:24.480 --> 13:27.723
It's what y'all do.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.170
Come in.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.047
<i>Hey, Coach.</i>

13:34.120 --> 13:37.169
I'm Hank.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.163
So, you're making plays?

13:39.240 --> 13:40.844
Mm-hmm.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.842
Yeah.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.685
Look, I know you're a busy man,
so I'll get right to the point.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.246
<i>I'd like to have a meeting
with your football team.</i>

13:47.320 --> 13:48.970
About what?

13:49.040 --> 13:51.646
Jesus Christ.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.728
Oh, wow, what are you, some
kind of preacher or something?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.848
No, no, not a preacher.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.922
<i>I'm a sports chaplain,
actually.</i>

14:00.000 --> 14:02.844
<i>I like to find different
teams to work with.</i>

14:02.920 --> 14:04.046
<i>I just wanna talk to 'em.</i>

14:04.120 --> 14:07.124
Well, I'm sorry, Hank,
but you can't.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.290
You know this
is a public school?

14:12.360 --> 14:13.566
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:13.640 --> 14:14.641
Yeah, I know.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.009
<i>Look, I've seen some things
all over the country.</i>

14:19.080 --> 14:23.005
I've seen amazing things.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.050
Well, you are
not gonna see them here.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.885
I think your players
could use it.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.086
I think you could too.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.640
Listen, Hank, if my team
needs something,

14:32.720 --> 14:34.722
I will tell you.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.524
Wait up, Johnnie.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.761
<i>So, who is she?</i>

14:57.840 --> 15:00.161
<i>Her name Johnnie, I told you.</i>

15:00.240 --> 15:01.446
<i>That's her real name?</i>

15:01.520 --> 15:03.363
That's the name
she go by.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.444
If you're so curious, why
don't you just ask her yourself?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.163
<i>Of course, that would
require you to actually talk,</i>

15:12.240 --> 15:14.891
or ride the bus
with the rest of us.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.610
I talk.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.965
She don't even
know you exist.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.326
Nobody does.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.488
How she gonna see
what's invisible?

15:22.560 --> 15:23.686
Reggie...

15:41.240 --> 15:43.891
Hey, break it up!

15:46.360 --> 15:48.124
Break it up, now!

16:02.960 --> 16:05.884
I expect you to control
your school, son!

16:05.960 --> 16:07.530
Five hundred kids

16:07.600 --> 16:09.800
getting bussed to a place
every day they don't wanna be.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.444
Twenty-five hundred kids
don't want 'em here.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.284
What did you think
was gonna happen?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.283
What's he talking for?
He ain't got a right here.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.521
- I'm not gonna stand here...
- Let me deal with it.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.329
I don't have to stand here
and be berated

16:18.400 --> 16:19.322
by this gentleman.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.890
- Coach!
- I'm not done!

16:21.000 --> 16:22.968
COACH!
I could arrange that!

16:23.040 --> 16:25.042
<i>Now, who do you
think you are?</i>

16:25.120 --> 16:26.690
Oh yeah, you're
the assistant principal.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.127
Only reason you are that is
'cause we ain't got nobody else.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.204
<i>Now, if you're done, I got
something to say to you.</i>

16:35.320 --> 16:38.802
The national spotlight is off
our city first time in a decade,

16:38.880 --> 16:40.450
<i>so I think it's time
our town</i>

16:40.560 --> 16:42.324
<i>came to its right
and proper balance.</i>

16:42.400 --> 16:47.167
<i>And if that means closing
the doors to this school,</i>

16:47.240 --> 16:49.242
Well, so be it.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.563
We've stayed.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.325
While others have left,
we've stayed.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.404
<i>And we stayed because
we love this school.</i>

17:03.080 --> 17:06.209
<i>This school has been
an enduring beacon</i>

17:06.280 --> 17:10.001
to this city for many years,
and we all know that.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.640
Now, do you really
want its final legacy

17:11.680 --> 17:15.730
to be failed integration?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.644
What would that do?

17:18.720 --> 17:22.122
Why don't you tell me
about that, sir?

17:22.200 --> 17:26.364
All right, Tandy,
I'll tell you.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.563
<i>If there is
one more incident...</i>

17:29.640 --> 17:31.244
...you're done.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.531
<i>Both of you.</i>

17:34.600 --> 17:37.171
Y'all have a nice day.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.890
Thank you, Gene.
You too.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.610
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

17:42.120 --> 17:43.724
Comin'!

17:46.080 --> 17:47.605
Hello?

17:47.680 --> 17:49.250
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

17:49.320 --> 17:51.280
Hey, oh, hey, listen,
Todd's got a Pop Warner game

17:51.320 --> 17:52.970
now on Saturday at 3 p.m.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.565
<i>Now, you tell me
you're gonna be there.</i>

17:54.640 --> 17:56.005
Look, something happened.
I'm okay, but...

17:56.080 --> 17:57.241
<i>What happened?</i>

17:57.320 --> 17:58.481
What always happens.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.482
<i>How bad?</i>

17:59.560 --> 18:02.609
Six went to the hospital.
Knives mostly.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.282
<i>You Okay?</i>

18:04.360 --> 18:06.647
Let's go, Tandy.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.722
Tandy, are you okay?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.645
I gotta go.
Yeah, I'm okay. Bye.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.688
Hey, Coach.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.410
Can I talk to the team now?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.005
Look, I don't have time
to deal with this right now.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.002
Tandy, let's go.
Tandy, now!

18:19.080 --> 18:20.366
Coach!

18:20.440 --> 18:22.602
This is what I do.
I help people.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.569
You know what?
You have five minutes.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.210
After training in the gym.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.964
You talk to Stearns.
You better be good.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.644
Now!

18:29.840 --> 18:31.410
Can I get an introduction?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.130
No.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.640
All right, guys,
let's settle down.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.966
Bring it in.
Guys.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.530
Hey, hey!
Settle down.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.809
<i>We have a motivational speaker
here, if you guys don't mind.</i>

18:41.880 --> 18:43.405
Hey, guys.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.289
I got it.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.010
Good luck.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.571
<i>Hey, everybody.
My name's Hank.</i>

18:58.640 --> 19:00.210
Hey, Hank.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.204
I'm not a coach.
I'm not a teacher.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.362
I'm not a counselor.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.968
<i>In fact, nobody asked me
to come here today.</i>

19:10.040 --> 19:13.408
But I look at what happened
this afternoon, and I think,

19:13.480 --> 19:15.960
"Aren't you sick of it?"

19:16.040 --> 19:17.610
<i>I mean, I'm sick of it.</i>

19:17.680 --> 19:20.286
<i>I'm not even from here,
but does this kind of thing</i>

19:20.360 --> 19:26.606
happen so much
that it just feels normal?

19:26.680 --> 19:30.287
<i>I mean, you don't know me,
you've never seen me before,</i>

19:30.360 --> 19:33.603
but what would you say if I
told you that 100% without fail,

19:33.680 --> 19:36.331
it doesn't have to be this way?

19:39.600 --> 19:45.482
<i>Birmingham has seen
nothing but hate for so long,</i>

19:45.560 --> 19:49.246
<i>it has lost its ability
to believe.</i>

19:49.320 --> 19:52.005
<i>It's lost hope.</i>

19:52.080 --> 19:54.606
<i>Let me tell you
what Jesus said.</i>

19:54.680 --> 20:01.723
<i>He said, "I am the way,
I am the truth, I am the life."</i>

20:02.760 --> 20:05.047
<i>And that means something to me</i>

20:05.120 --> 20:09.603
<i>because I let it mean
something to me.</i>

20:09.680 --> 20:13.765
<i>I'll tell you something else
that seems crazy, only it's not.</i>

20:13.840 --> 20:15.490
<i>I love you.</i>

20:15.560 --> 20:19.121
<i>I care about you,
each and every one of you.</i>

20:19.200 --> 20:22.363
<i>I care about what you've seen.</i>

20:22.440 --> 20:27.970
<i>I care about what
you've been through.</i>

20:28.080 --> 20:32.642
<i>I care about your pain.</i>

20:32.720 --> 20:33.960
So does God.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.520
Jerry, what's going on?
I said 5 minutes.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.170
He's been here
for an hour.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.366
We need to wrap this up.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.011
Tandy, hold on, man.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.366
Man, I know
this sounds crazy,

20:43.440 --> 20:46.762
but just give
the guy a chance.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.003
We ain't got
nothing else to lose.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.765
You don't know me,
but I'm asking you anyway

20:52.840 --> 20:56.606
to stand up right now,
right here,

20:56.680 --> 20:58.967
and make a decision...

20:59.040 --> 21:01.850
<i>...a decision to change,
to forgive,</i>

21:01.920 --> 21:06.926
<i>to be forgiven
no matter what you've done.</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:11.446
That's how much God loves you.

21:11.520 --> 21:17.004
<i>I'm asking you
to choose Jesus.</i>

21:19.520 --> 21:23.320
Can you do that?

21:23.400 --> 21:25.402
Will you do that...

21:28.720 --> 21:33.362
...with me, right now?

21:43.040 --> 21:44.724
Thank you.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.602
Brave men.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.086
What just happened?

22:33.280 --> 22:35.282
Where have you been?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.570
The gym.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.642
And what happened
at the gym?

22:45.160 --> 22:51.770
I let an untrained religious nut
convert the whole team.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.730
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

22:54.800 --> 22:57.280
The whole team.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.926
Is that good or bad?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.968
<i>I don't know.</i>

23:14.720 --> 23:16.290
<i>Birmingham Post Herald</i>

23:16.360 --> 23:19.364
<i>believes something
about this team.</i>

23:19.440 --> 23:22.091
They believe we're
only gonna win two games.

23:22.160 --> 23:25.528
<i>They believe that this season
is the death rattle</i>

23:25.600 --> 23:29.047
<i>of a school that is
barely able to stay alive.</i>

23:29.120 --> 23:31.964
You see, I don't believe this
for a minute.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.442
I believe that we are
the masters of our own fate.

23:35.520 --> 23:40.367
<i>I believe that we can prove
these people wrong.</i>

23:40.480 --> 23:42.608
<i>Why don't you go out there
and show me</i>

23:42.680 --> 23:44.569
<i>what you all believe?</i>

23:44.640 --> 23:46.244
Let's go do it!

23:53.760 --> 23:55.489
Play our boys!

23:55.560 --> 23:57.210
Come on, Tandy!

23:58.480 --> 24:00.528
<i>Just no win.</i>

24:00.600 --> 24:04.047
Puts them black boys in,
we riot.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.645
<i>He doesn't, they riot.</i>

24:14.680 --> 24:16.011
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in,
bring 'em in!

24:16.080 --> 24:18.082
Bring 'em in!

24:22.320 --> 24:23.970
<i>Play our boys, Tandy!</i>

24:24.040 --> 24:25.883
I know you hear me!

24:25.960 --> 24:28.008
Hey, sit down
and shut up!

24:28.080 --> 24:30.208
<i>Hey, don't talk to my wife like that.</i>

24:30.320 --> 24:32.288
<i>You don't talk to
my wife like that.</i>

24:32.360 --> 24:33.885
I don't expect you to win,

24:33.960 --> 24:36.440
but I expect you
to keep things quiet.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.409
<i>It's not my fault, Owen.</i>

24:38.480 --> 24:39.811
<i>I'm trying to coach football.</i>

24:39.880 --> 24:43.202
<i>This is bigger than football, Tandy.</i>

24:43.280 --> 24:44.930
All right, then.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.088
Get Nathan.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.286
What?

24:50.360 --> 24:52.010
Nathan!

24:52.880 --> 24:55.121
<i>Nathan, let's go.</i>

24:55.200 --> 24:57.601
<i>Come on, son.
Let's go.</i>

24:57.680 --> 25:00.763
<i>That's right.
Our boys wanna play too.</i>

25:02.520 --> 25:04.090
Hey, safety.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.605
Go.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.326
Field wrangler, cover two.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.925
<i>Field wrangler, cover two.</i>

25:24.040 --> 25:25.644
<i>Ready, break!</i>

25:26.520 --> 25:28.443
<i>Nathan!</i>

25:28.520 --> 25:30.090
The slot!

25:30.160 --> 25:32.401
<i>The slot, Nathan!</i>

25:47.920 --> 25:49.570
<i>Hut!</i>

26:01.640 --> 26:03.927
<i>Run! Go, Nathan!
Don't just stand there!</i>

26:04.040 --> 26:05.451
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

26:27.920 --> 26:29.570
<i>Come on, ref!
That was a late hit!</i>

26:29.640 --> 26:30.766
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

26:30.840 --> 26:32.490
Come on, Ref!

26:33.800 --> 26:35.450
Welcome to the game.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.920
<i>I thought you said
God was gonna bless us.</i>

26:53.000 --> 26:55.082
<i>I thought we were gonna win.</i>

26:55.160 --> 26:57.606
Maybe God is testing us.

26:57.720 --> 27:01.930
Maybe he wants to know
that our commitment is real,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.607
<i>not just to win
football games.</i>

27:16.880 --> 27:19.326
Look who decided
to ride the bus today.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.640
Hey, Johnnie,
this is Tony.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.762
He don't talk much.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.569
I know who you are.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.205
<i>Really?</i>

27:43.280 --> 27:45.044
<i>So, what you mean
you don't talk, hmm?</i>

27:45.120 --> 27:46.884
It's 'cause you just
ain't got nothing to say

27:46.960 --> 27:48.610
or too afraid to say it?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.205
Both.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.009
<i>Reggie, let him talk.</i>

27:52.080 --> 27:54.606
If you scored,
we would've won the game.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.728
Why you so afraid
of getting hit?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.802
'Cause it hurts.

27:58.880 --> 28:05.764
<i>That's too bad.</i>

28:05.840 --> 28:08.081
Ooh-hoo!

28:16.160 --> 28:18.162
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

28:18.880 --> 28:21.247
Hey, Tony, did you hear
about the meeting tonight?

28:21.320 --> 28:22.970
<i>Fellowship
of Christian Athletes.</i>

28:23.040 --> 28:26.408
<i>Count you in?</i>

28:26.480 --> 28:28.130
What happened
to your foot?

28:28.200 --> 28:30.362
<i>Oh, when I was in college,
I was working part-time</i>

28:30.440 --> 28:32.920
during the summer
at a steel mill.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.207
Accident took away
half my foot

28:35.280 --> 28:38.363
and my dreams of playing
professional baseball.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.762
Man, baseball was everything
to me back then.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.922
Man, I'm sorry about that.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.401
Don't be sorry.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.121
I think that sometimes
before you can have

28:50.200 --> 28:51.725
new dreams in this life,

28:51.800 --> 28:54.963
the old ones have to be
taken away from you.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.964
Look, there's something
I've wanted to say to you

28:58.040 --> 29:01.044
since the first time
I saw you play.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.882
There's something
special about you, Tony.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.088
I can see it.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.003
You have a gift.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.765
That's something
that can't be taught.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.491
That can only be given.

29:15.560 --> 29:22.091
But you have to decide
what you wanna do with it.

29:22.160 --> 29:28.122
When you play for yourself,
you can be great.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.285
But when you play for something
higher than yourself,

29:32.360 --> 29:35.364
that's when something
extraordinary can happen.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.006
God has a purpose
for all of us,

29:41.080 --> 29:42.684
and it is not insignificant.

29:42.800 --> 29:48.921
And obviously, I can't know
what yours is, but I think...

29:50.800 --> 29:54.805
I think God wants you
to be a superstar.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.330
No such thing.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.490
As what?

30:08.400 --> 30:11.165
<i>There's no such thing
as a black superstar.</i>

30:11.240 --> 30:13.641
<i>Not in this state.</i>

30:26.320 --> 30:28.971
You okay, buddy?

30:29.040 --> 30:31.486
I just hate to lose, Dad.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.204
I hate it.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.170
I hate it so bad.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.801
You say you'll do anything
to win, but you won't.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.882
Didn't you see him run?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.450
Hike!

31:00.320 --> 31:01.970
Come on, they're killing us!

31:02.040 --> 31:03.565
If they're not gonna
give him the ball,

31:03.640 --> 31:05.608
this is just a waste
of time, Junior.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.370
<i>We need a new coach!</i>

31:12.440 --> 31:14.329
<i>Tandy, you're in trouble!</i>

31:16.120 --> 31:18.088
<i>Time out. Time out.</i>

31:18.160 --> 31:20.447
<i>Boys, bring it in.
Come here.</i>

31:21.960 --> 31:25.248
<i>Nathan, come here.</i>

31:25.360 --> 31:27.488
This your time
to shine, let's go.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.845
That a boy, Tony!

31:30.920 --> 31:32.649
Okay, Nathan's
in at tailback.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.881
<i>Wait, wait, Coach!</i>

31:33.960 --> 31:35.166
Power I, guys.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.446
Eleven yards,
that's what I need, okay?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.284
That's my position!
He don't know the offense yet!

31:38.360 --> 31:40.249
Morton!
This is my team!

31:40.320 --> 31:44.291
<i>It's not a democracy!
Now go sit down!</i>

31:48.200 --> 31:49.770
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

31:49.840 --> 31:51.842
<i>Nathan.</i>

31:54.240 --> 31:56.129
You know what I believe?

31:56.200 --> 32:00.842
That you are faster than them,
so you show me.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.684
Yes, sir.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.530
Tandy!

32:29.480 --> 32:31.369
This is a contact sport,
okay?

32:31.440 --> 32:33.204
When someone wants to hit you,

32:33.280 --> 32:35.726
it feels good to hit 'em
first, okay? Try it.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.325
<i>Atta boy, Tony!</i>

32:37.400 --> 32:39.004
Gonna be 1st down
right now!

32:39.080 --> 32:40.684
Tandy, put my boy in.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.649
You're killing us!

32:47.560 --> 32:49.164
Break!

33:07.920 --> 33:09.922
That's my baby!

33:16.400 --> 33:18.641
All right,
let's punch it in.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.722
<i>Nathan, out.</i>

33:22.360 --> 33:24.010
<i>Nice one, 22!</i>

33:24.760 --> 33:26.330
Hey, Tony.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.680
How'd that feel?

33:27.760 --> 33:29.410
Good.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.129
Really good.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.370
Come here, baby!

33:41.440 --> 33:43.169
Momma is so proud of you.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.083
Great game, son.
Great game.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.730
Who is this?

33:46.800 --> 33:48.450
This is Johnnie.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.170
Hi.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.208
Oh, she sure is
pretty, Tony.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.406
Oh, it's not like that.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.970
What church you go to?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.166
Momma!

33:56.240 --> 33:58.049
No girl better even think
about marrying my Tony

33:58.120 --> 33:59.724
without being church-going.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.325
I don't go to church.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.323
<i>Well, you gonna
go to church with us.</i>

34:03.400 --> 34:04.970
<i>And I see I'm a have
to fatten you up,</i>

34:05.040 --> 34:06.371
'cause I don't know
how you think you gonna

34:06.480 --> 34:09.324
have my grandbabies
with hips like that.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.925
<i>Uh, let's just let them be.</i>

34:12.000 --> 34:14.128
Yeah, well a closed mouth
don't get fed, Junior.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.047
I want my boy
to play college ball.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.724
All right,
he has that opportunity,

34:18.800 --> 34:20.960
and I don't think it's right
that it's being taken away

34:21.000 --> 34:22.603
by somebody
who don't even belong.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.444
I coach the team
that I am given, Bull.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.090
I coach to win.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.685
That is my commitment
to myself, this school,

34:27.760 --> 34:30.127
and every parent in it,
including you.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.081
Hey.
Hey!

34:33.159 --> 34:36.083
You gonna get
that colored boy hurt.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.608
Therefore,
since we are surrounded

34:42.679 --> 34:45.524
by such a great cloud
of witnesses,

34:45.600 --> 34:49.206
let us lay aside
every weight.

34:49.280 --> 34:53.888
<i>We have to run this race
called life with patience.</i>

34:53.960 --> 34:57.601
<i>Are you willing to run the race
and put down the shame?</i>

34:57.680 --> 34:59.330
<i>Amen!</i>

34:59.400 --> 35:01.323
<i>Turn to your neighbor
and say, "Put it down."</i>

35:01.400 --> 35:02.526
Put it down!

35:02.600 --> 35:05.729
How many of y'all have a race
you know you got to run?

35:07.880 --> 35:12.568
<i>You think 'cause you
got that many races to run.</i>

35:12.640 --> 35:15.041
<i>We need those
that will accomplish</i>

35:15.120 --> 35:18.124
<i>all God has laid before us.</i>

35:18.200 --> 35:21.443
<i>We need a man,
a woman, or someone...</i>

35:21.520 --> 35:23.249
Finally.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.890
Amen, Pastor!

35:24.960 --> 35:26.564
<i>Because they're looking at you.</i>

35:26.640 --> 35:28.165
<i>Because they're
looking to the church.</i>

35:28.240 --> 35:29.810
<i>Because they're
looking to a better day.</i>

35:29.880 --> 35:31.530
<i>Because they're
looking to a new day.</i>

35:31.600 --> 35:34.444
Why? Because
it's time to rise up!

35:34.520 --> 35:36.045
Rise up!

35:36.120 --> 35:39.841
Somebody's gotta
rise up this morning!

35:46.800 --> 35:48.450
Rise up.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.090
You buy all that stuff?

35:50.160 --> 35:53.209
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

35:53.280 --> 35:55.931
Been taught it all my life.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.642
I finally feel like I own it,
like it's mine.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.410
What about you?

36:02.480 --> 36:06.201
I'm Christian same
as the next person,

36:06.280 --> 36:08.965
but I believe rising up
means fighting back,

36:09.040 --> 36:11.202
only way things
are gonna change.

36:11.280 --> 36:15.649
Tony, we in a system that
prevents any type of aspiration,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.324
any type of growth.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.526
Johnnie...

36:18.600 --> 36:19.931
And then when one of us
can't take it anymore,

36:20.000 --> 36:21.445
we're made an example of.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.760
We take the blame.

36:22.840 --> 36:23.762
Hey, Johnnie!

36:23.840 --> 36:25.330
Nuh-uh, but the blame
belongs in the system,

36:25.400 --> 36:27.129
the system that's been keeping
us down time after time.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.202
Johnnie Francis!

36:31.320 --> 36:33.209
Go out with me.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.442
What?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.090
Friday night.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.730
Okay, fine.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.365
I'll pick you up?

36:40.440 --> 36:42.010
Nuh-uh
I'll meet you there.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.684
I'll pick you up.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.842
I'll meet you there.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.764
Rising up still means
fighting back.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.128
All right, let's bow our heads.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.089
Dear God,
thank you for this day.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.889
<i>Thank you for this chance
to play football</i>

36:58.960 --> 37:00.564
<i>and fellowship together.</i>

37:00.640 --> 37:02.563
<i>And we hope that we
honor you and your glory.</i>

37:02.640 --> 37:05.530
In Jesus' name, amen.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.523
Let's go, man.
Come on.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.443
<i>First team O, first team D,
let's go.</i>

37:15.800 --> 37:17.529
Well, he's paying attention.

37:17.600 --> 37:22.686
He's paying attention now,
and that's the whole thing.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.450
Excuse me.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.411
Amen.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.524
So, you're all in, huh?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.125
Yep.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.770
You are?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.410
Yeah.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.609
All right, then.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.250
You know, we're meeting
with the players tonight

37:44.320 --> 37:46.641
over at Crestwood.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.290
You should come.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.362
If it was my neighborhood,
maybe.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.363
But Crestwood, come on,
you know it's only gonna be

37:52.440 --> 37:54.010
white players there, Jerry.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.731
I mean, what's that
gonna achieve?

37:58.520 --> 38:00.443
Shorty White, 2 o'clock.

38:02.920 --> 38:03.842
Whoo!

38:03.920 --> 38:05.922
I give you 30 seconds.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.128
I'll give him
less than that.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.009
<i>We're coming after you, Tandy.</i>

38:10.080 --> 38:13.243
<i>Ooh, 8 more weeks
'til judgment day.</i>

38:13.320 --> 38:15.721
Glorious rivalry day.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.883
Banks' Jets coming at you
from the clouds.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.564
<i>I'm bringing my
white knight, son.</i>

38:20.640 --> 38:24.440
<i>I know you know who he is,
Mr. Jeff Rutledge.</i>

38:24.520 --> 38:27.000
He's only the best
quarterback in the state, folks.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.082
Birmingham News printed that.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.725
<i>I didn't say it.</i>

38:34.080 --> 38:40.087
<i>♪ Simple kind of man ♪</i>

38:40.160 --> 38:46.725

38:47.720 --> 38:54.729
<i>♪ Baby, be a simple

38:56.200 --> 38:58.362
<i>♪ Won't you do this

38:58.480 --> 39:00.482
Hey, Coach.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.728
Good to see you.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.723
Ain't never seen
a house this big.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.802
No, me neither.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.010
You coming in?

39:11.080 --> 39:12.286
You go ahead.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.362
I'm just gonna have
a quick smoke.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.683
You really should.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.127
It's pretty cool.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.928
<i>Well, Shorty White
beat 'em two seasons ago.</i>

39:54.000 --> 39:57.447
<i>Golly, how many'd
they dress, a hundred?</i>

39:57.520 --> 39:59.522
<i>They got three times our budget
and a new stadium.</i>

39:59.600 --> 40:01.602
<i>I don't see how that's fair.</i>

40:02.600 --> 40:07.447
We need to redefine winning.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.090
Like a field goal, right?

40:09.160 --> 40:12.448
I mean, no one's scored on 'em
this whole season,

40:12.520 --> 40:14.807
and a field goal, bam,
that's winning.

40:14.880 --> 40:18.885
<i>Jerry, is this real?</i>

40:20.080 --> 40:22.367
How does a whole team
convert?

40:22.480 --> 40:24.642
<i>How is it that the only
place in the whole city</i>

40:24.720 --> 40:26.722
<i>that blacks and whites get
along is my football team?</i>

40:26.800 --> 40:28.370
Why are you so cynical?

40:28.440 --> 40:32.968
Because I believe
in what I can see.

40:33.040 --> 40:38.444
With all due respect, Coach,
you might start looking around.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.402
Hey, we're gonna
win this thing.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.050
- Oh, here we go.
- Really?

40:43.120 --> 40:44.645
<i>We're gonna win this game,</i>

40:44.720 --> 40:46.643
and I've got something
I wanna say to the team.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.370
Whoo!
Woodlawn!

40:48.440 --> 40:50.090
Whoo!

40:51.080 --> 40:52.605
<i>Welcome back, everybody.</i>

40:52.720 --> 40:54.688
<i>This is WXJC Birmingham,
and we're following</i>

40:54.760 --> 40:56.649
<i>the number-one team
in the state,</i>

40:56.720 --> 41:00.088
<i>the Huffman Vikings,
on their so-far uncontested road</i>

41:00.160 --> 41:01.844
<i>to another championship.</i>

41:01.920 --> 41:04.764
Now, tonight, they square off
against the Woodlawn Colonels,

41:04.840 --> 41:08.606
and this should be a routine,
regular season ball game,

41:08.680 --> 41:10.489
as they're favored
by 6 touchdowns.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.564
And on paper, folks, there's
no way at all that Woodlawn

41:13.640 --> 41:16.610
<i>has a chance against
this powerful ball club.</i>

41:19.360 --> 41:20.930
<i>Okay boys, listen up.</i>

41:21.040 --> 41:23.042
The preacher wants
to say a few words.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.724
Thank you, Coach.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.370
Make it good.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.010
Yeah.

41:28.080 --> 41:31.402
<i>Read the highlighted,
right there.</i>

41:36.680 --> 41:38.682
"This day... "

41:44.120 --> 41:48.330
<i>"This day the Lord
will deliver you into my hand</i>

41:48.440 --> 41:50.886
and I will strike you down."

41:50.960 --> 41:55.409
<i>So that all on earth know
that there is a God in Israel.</i>

41:55.480 --> 41:58.051
And David reached
into his pocket,

41:58.160 --> 42:00.049
and he pulled out a stone.

42:00.160 --> 42:05.246
And he slung it, and it struck
the Philistine in the head.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.482
<i>And he fell.</i>

42:07.560 --> 42:09.722
You know what's gonna happen?

42:09.800 --> 42:12.610
You're gonna win this game
tonight, you hear me?

42:12.680 --> 42:14.250
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

42:14.320 --> 42:15.890
<i>You're gonna win this game!</i>

42:15.960 --> 42:18.281
You wanna know how I know
that you're gonna win this game?

42:18.360 --> 42:21.728
Because it's not about you.

42:21.800 --> 42:26.727
Nobody out there knows
what's happened with this team.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.566
<i>But when you win,
on this day, they will.</i>

42:30.640 --> 42:34.531
When you do what everyone
said is impossible, they will.

42:34.600 --> 42:38.446
When you strike down
this giant, they will!

42:38.520 --> 42:41.922
<i>And when they find out
how you did it,</i>

42:42.000 --> 42:45.641
then all the earth will know
that there is a God in Israel

42:45.720 --> 42:47.290
on this day.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.284
On this day!
On this day!

42:50.360 --> 42:53.204
On this day! On this clay!

42:59.880 --> 43:02.645
Hey, you're starting
at tailback tonight.

43:02.720 --> 43:05.121
<i>One, two, three, Woodlawn!</i>

43:18.920 --> 43:21.924
Nathan, come on.
We gotta go.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.809
Yes, sir.

43:23.880 --> 43:27.771
Let's just see
what happens, okay?

43:29.320 --> 43:30.970
Your momma's gonna kill me.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.604
Turn, boys!

43:41.160 --> 43:43.049
<i>Receives deep at the 10-yard line.</i>

43:43.120 --> 43:45.930
<i>Outstanding blocking as they
break open the double wedge,</i>

43:46.000 --> 43:49.800
<i>just bowling over the much
smaller Woodlawn Colonels.</i>

43:56.920 --> 43:58.570
Good job.
Good job.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.247
Stack grip, cover two.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.049
<i>Get out of here, come on.</i>

44:13.520 --> 44:15.887
<i>Stay in your lane!
Stay in your lane!</i>

44:16.360 --> 44:17.964
<i>And touchdown.</i>

44:18.040 --> 44:20.850
<i>Ackman is in the end zone,
taking only two plays.</i>

44:20.920 --> 44:22.922
<i>And I have a feeling
this is just a portent</i>

44:23.000 --> 44:25.128
<i>of what we're gonna be
seeing here this evening.</i>

44:25.200 --> 44:28.409
<i>It could be a massacre
on the football field tonight.</i>

44:28.480 --> 44:30.528
They're big, Coach.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.728
Really big.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.884
<i>Hey there, David.</i>

44:47.200 --> 44:49.123
What do you say you
go in there right now

44:49.200 --> 44:51.282
and take down that giant?

44:51.360 --> 44:53.362
Make 'em all believe.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.930
Break!

45:03.760 --> 45:07.481
<i>Woodlawn lines up at their
own 20 in the I formation.</i>

45:07.600 --> 45:11.446
<i>Their tailback, number 22,
we've not seen him before.</i>

45:11.560 --> 45:14.723
<i>His name is Tony Nathan.</i>

45:23.320 --> 45:24.924
Go Tony!

45:25.280 --> 45:28.682
<i>Nathan breaks the tackle.</i>

45:28.760 --> 45:29.761
<i>Look at this guy go.</i>

45:29.840 --> 45:31.410
<i>He's 40 past midfield.</i>

45:31.480 --> 45:33.084
<i>One more man to beat.</i>

45:33.160 --> 45:36.164
<i>There he goes
to the 30, the 20, the 10.</i>

45:36.240 --> 45:39.961
<i>And for the first time
in over a year.</i>

45:40.040 --> 45:43.044
<i>Touchdown Woodlawn.
An unbelievable run.</i>

45:43.120 --> 45:46.727
<i>What a play by
young Tony Nathan.</i>

45:54.640 --> 45:56.165
Hey, brother.

45:56.240 --> 45:58.891
Jesus has a plan
for your life.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.767
<i>Ackman Driving back with a vengeance.</i>

46:04.840 --> 46:07.002
<i>They're deep
in Woodlawn territory.</i>

46:07.080 --> 46:09.765
<i>Murphy breaks left,
picks up 5 yards.</i>

46:11.160 --> 46:12.082
It's a fumble!

46:12.160 --> 46:13.446
<i>Woodlawn has it.</i>

46:13.520 --> 46:17.206
<i>An incredible hit by middle
linebacker, Mike Allyson.</i>

46:17.280 --> 46:19.120
<i>Allyson, Allyson, come here!
Come here.</i>

46:19.160 --> 46:20.446
<i>Good hit, son.
Great hit.</i>

46:20.520 --> 46:22.488
How many players are out there?
No, there's one.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.164
Just one.
Number 45.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.368
You take him out
and you clear a path for Nathan.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.010
You take him out,
we win this game.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.730
Nathan, get in there.

46:30.200 --> 46:32.123
<i>Alright, so what are
you gonna do now, Coach?</i>

46:32.200 --> 46:34.680
I'm just gonna
give the ball to Tony.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.649
<i>And this is unbelievable.</i>

46:36.720 --> 46:38.688
<i>The underdog
Woodlawn Colonels</i>

46:38.760 --> 46:43.129
<i>have the number-one team
in the state on their heels.</i>

47:16.960 --> 47:21.761
<i>It is absolutely pandemonium here tonight.</i>

47:21.840 --> 47:24.127
<i>The number-one team
in the state is being</i>

47:24.200 --> 47:27.522
<i>single-handedly dismantled
by this young</i>

47:27.600 --> 47:29.602
<i>junior tailback from Woodlawn.</i>

47:32.080 --> 47:33.650
We are witnessing
a star being born.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.290
Touchdown!

47:35.360 --> 47:37.442
<i>Touchdown, Tony Nathan.</i>

47:45.040 --> 47:47.008
<i>And there it is. It's all over.</i>

47:47.080 --> 47:49.845
<i>It is all over.
Woodlawn has done it.</i>

47:49.920 --> 47:52.207
<i>Woodlawn has done
the impossible.</i>

47:52.280 --> 47:55.329
<i>The biggest upset
we have seen in years.</i>

47:55.400 --> 47:57.562
<i>I can't believe it.
That is it.</i>

47:57.640 --> 48:00.166
<i>The champ is down.</i>

48:20.320 --> 48:21.242
Great game.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.242
Coach.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.084
Coach, I don't know what
your players are playing with,

48:24.160 --> 48:26.322
but I've never seen
a team play like that.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.289
Good luck
the rest of the season.

48:28.360 --> 48:29.930
Let's go, son.

49:20.120 --> 49:23.681
<i>For God so loved the
world that he gave who?</i>

49:23.760 --> 49:25.285
<i>His only begotten Son.</i>

49:25.360 --> 49:27.966
<i>That whosoever believeth
in him should not perish,</i>

49:28.040 --> 49:29.610
<i>but what will they have?</i>

49:29.680 --> 49:31.205
<i>Everlasting life.</i>

49:31.320 --> 49:35.120
<i>God loved us,
so he gave us Jesus.</i>

49:35.240 --> 49:39.962
<i>If he gave you a gift, why
do you have it wrapped up?</i>

49:40.080 --> 49:44.608
Because the world needs the gift
that is trapped inside of you.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.444
As a matter of fact, Tony,
you stand up,

49:46.520 --> 49:49.649
because you are using
your gift for God's glory.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.442
<i>Give Tony
a round of applause.</i>

49:53.520 --> 49:57.241
<i>We're proud of you, son,
for how you are letting God</i>

49:57.320 --> 49:59.209
shine through you every day.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.850
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:00.920 --> 50:02.445
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

50:02.560 --> 50:04.881
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

50:07.520 --> 50:09.966
<i>Coach Gerelds,
we welcome you</i>

50:10.040 --> 50:13.044
<i>and your family here
this morning.</i>

50:14.920 --> 50:17.446
Can I say a few words
please, sir?

50:17.520 --> 50:19.363
Come on, then.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.644
I wanted to come here
today because...

50:46.720 --> 50:49.724
...five of my players
are here.

50:54.640 --> 50:58.201
Five of my players
that have been mistreated

50:58.280 --> 51:00.282
<i>time and again
by their school...</i>

51:02.800 --> 51:04.802
<i>...and by their teammates...</i>

51:07.800 --> 51:12.124
...and I have not done
enough to stop it.

51:15.440 --> 51:19.809
Now, at the beginning
of this season, my team,

51:19.880 --> 51:24.408
almost my entire team,
they gave themselves to love.

51:27.480 --> 51:30.484
A love that I didn't understand.

51:32.920 --> 51:36.925
A love that began
to conquer hatred.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.446
And after the game on Friday,
I went home...

51:43.960 --> 51:45.962
...and I prayed.

51:47.280 --> 51:50.284
Not that I really
know how to do that...

51:53.640 --> 51:55.642
...but I told God that,

51:58.200 --> 52:00.202
"I don't know
if you're real...

52:03.440 --> 52:07.331
...but I want whatever
my players have."

52:16.440 --> 52:21.241
And I came here today
because I believe.

52:27.200 --> 52:29.328
I believe,
and I wanna be baptized.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.043
Thank you, Jesus.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.002
Amen.
I'll baptize you.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.005
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.401
<i>Buried with Christ in baptism,</i>

52:56.480 --> 52:59.609
<i>raised to walk
in the newness of life.</i>

for a moment?

53:39.560 --> 53:41.164
Sure.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.083
Look, I know
that this has been...

53:46.200 --> 53:50.649
this has been a real tough year,
and it's been tough at school,

53:50.720 --> 53:53.166
and I know we haven't spent
much time with each other.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.765
That's okay.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.968
No, it's not.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.042
There's no excuse for it.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.602
You mean a lot.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.842
I love you, son.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.004
You mean the world to me.

54:14.080 --> 54:18.290
I think my biggest problem
is that I...

54:18.400 --> 54:21.244
I haven't had enough staff.

54:21.360 --> 54:26.287
So, I was wondering if you
would be willing to help me

54:26.360 --> 54:29.011
as an assistant coach.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.650
I don't know.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.200
How's it feel to have your
whole team on your shoulders?

55:52.280 --> 55:53.805
Heavy.

56:04.600 --> 56:08.127
<i>That boy is something special.

Good football player too.

<i>Hey, Uncle Tom.</i>

56:29.640 --> 56:32.450
They gonna turn on you.

56:32.520 --> 56:35.649
You see, we could use
a voice like yours,

56:35.720 --> 56:41.011
so join us.

56:41.080 --> 56:45.449
<i>Okay, then, you stay
away from her, huh?</i>

56:45.520 --> 56:47.807
I mean, she ain't
your kind no more.

56:47.880 --> 56:50.281
You wanna be one of these

56:50.360 --> 56:53.762
<i>So, why don't you just
stay with your own, huh?</i>

57:05.120 --> 57:06.963
How'd you find out
where I live?

57:07.040 --> 57:09.122
I asked.

57:09.200 --> 57:13.649
Look, some people came
to talk to me from school.

57:13.720 --> 57:19.443
Told me about some gangs,
some robberies.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.364
About you.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.283
Well, is it true?

57:25.360 --> 57:27.169
I'm sorry, Tony.

57:27.240 --> 57:31.245
Not everybody can be
as squeaky clean as you.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.482
That's not you, Johnnie.
I know you.

57:33.560 --> 57:36.211
You don't know
anything about me.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.964
<i>What's going on?</i>

57:38.040 --> 57:40.327
Nothing, Daddy.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.801
I was just telling him
to leave.

57:45.800 --> 57:48.280
Well, I guess you
better be going, boy.

57:51.560 --> 57:54.609
Go, get out of here.

58:02.320 --> 58:05.244
Ladies and gentlemen, may
I have your attention please?

<i>Well, then, the governor
has just informed me</i>

59:14.720 --> 59:16.484
that he would like
to have a picture taken

59:16.560 --> 59:18.085

<i>So, Jeff, Nathan,

<i>We ain't got all night.</i>

I'm sorry.
I can't.

<i>What do you mean
you can't? Huh?</i>

59:35.480 --> 59:37.050
<i>You shy or something?</i>

59:37.120 --> 59:38.884
<i>I can't.</i>

59:38.960 --> 59:42.043
Well, of course you can.
The governor ain't gonna bite.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.724
Just stand up,
walk up to the governor,

59:43.800 --> 59:44.926
and take a picture with him.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.606
He said I couldn't
go to Alabama,

59:47.680 --> 59:51.048
not me or anybody like me.

59:51.120 --> 59:55.011

not tomorrow, not ever.

59:55.080 --> 59:58.880
<i>So, I can't, sir.</i>

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.166
<i>Tandy, you get your
Negro up there right now.</i>

You sure about that?

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.931
Mm-hmm.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.688
Take the picture.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.607
<i>Get on, come on!</i>

You call the police?

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.125
No, I did not.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.850
I'll call 'em.

<i>The only way.</i>

<i>Welcome, everybody,

<i>One of the most heated rivalries

<i>dating back over 4 decades.</i>

<i>It's no secret

<i>between Banks

Gentlemen, shake hands.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.922
<i>Have a good, clean game.</i>

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.643
I want you to punish them,
do you understand me?

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.647
Yes, sir!

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.682
What happens
to compassionate people?

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.682
They lose!

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.287
They lose, that's right.
They lose. They lose!

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.930
<i>It's been a Cinderella season for Woodlawn,</i>

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.570
<i>but they have to win
here tonight,</i>

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.881
<i>or that fairy tale is over.</i>

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.964
<i>Okay, come on, men.
Everyone take a knee.</i>

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.609
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.449
Jesus can't save you now,
fellas.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.568
This is Jets football!

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.210
Jesus can't save you now!

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.884
You're going down!

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.724
Amen.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.322
Boys, you ready to beat Banks?

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.322
Yes, sir!

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.526
I said are you ready
to beat Banks?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.522
Yes, sir!

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.250
One, two, three, believe!

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.928
<i>A devastating hit on Tony Nathan,</i>

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.164
<i>and he is getting up slowly
at the 30-yard line.</i>

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.810
Their gunnin' for him.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.410
<i>Hike!</i>

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.127
I know, Jerry.
I know.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.650
Come on, boy.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.843
<i>Nathan looks right,
then left, nowhere to go.</i>

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.608
High left, 4-24 draw.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.884
Hike!

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.690
<i>He is short.</i>

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.362
Down set.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.090
Blue 18.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.010
Blue 18.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.684
Hike!

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.250
Excuse me, Coach.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.762
Can't guard perfect, Coach.

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.729
<i>Get 41.
Forty-one!</i>

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.802
Down set!

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.769
<i>Hike!</i>

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.841
<i>Middle, middle, middle!</i>

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.205
<i>Touchdown!</i>

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.527
<i>Get out there, boys.</i>

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.689
You silence them, Nathan.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.808
Nathan, you silence them.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.644
You get out there,
and you shut them up.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.961
Come on, get it done.
Come on!

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.885
That's just football, boys.
Little bit of rain.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.689
Power C Waggle left on one.
On one.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.808
Ready, break.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.290
Hike!

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.249
Get up, son.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.809
<i>Hey, Danny!
You stop him right here.</i>

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.530
You hear me?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.051
You make 'em pay, son.
Right here!

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.085
<i>He's still on his feet.</i>

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.730
<i>He's in the 20, the 15,</i>

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.165
<i>working his way
through the defense</i>

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.605
<i>toward the end zone.</i>

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.206
<i>He's willing his way forward.
He scores.</i>

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.966
<i>Touchdown, Woodlawn.</i>

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.648
Break it up!
Break it up!

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.202
Atta boy, atta boy,
atta boy, atta boy.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.009
Hey, that flag
don't hurt me.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.082
That flag don't hurt me.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.529
<i>Doc!</i>

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.604
Coach, think we'll be taking
a big risk to let him play.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.241
Nathan, we win with you.

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:40.005
We cannot win without you.
You understand?

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.604
Tony!

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.721
Adversity is a crucible
of greatness.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.880
Yes, sir.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.086
Can you do this?

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.082
Yes, sir.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.607
Okay, let's do it.
Come on.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.729
Nathan!

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:08.408
Let's go.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.041
<i>Hey Coach, has it rained harder?</i>

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.804
Them angels is crying!

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.129
Them angels is crying!

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.602
I just wanna say that
I am proud of all of you.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.124
<i>I'm proud of each
and every one of you,</i>

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:16.168
for the game that
you played tonight

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.529
and the men that you
have become this season.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:39.041
Hank, come on, just...
you say something.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.923
Hey, hey, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.321
Why didn't you play me?

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.405
You know what is more important
than winning football games?

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.130
You are.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.369
You are.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.447
You are.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.729
<i>Jesus says to love our enemies.</i>

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.010
<i>We have to love
those that oppose us.</i>

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.523
<i>We have to love those
that are against us,</i>

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.049
<i>to do good to those
that persecute us.</i>

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:10.480
<i>This is the kind of love that
isn't easy, but if we do it,</i>

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.040
we will see change like
we have never seen before.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.929
Because here's the question.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.403
If you only love those
that love you back,

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.003
what kind of love is that?

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.844
<i>Amen!</i>

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.321
<i>Think about it, church.</i>

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.129
Think about it.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.650
<i>I can do pork chops.</i>

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.290
I'm gonna fry 'em up
in some flour.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.567
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.162
What in the world?

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.086
That's Bear Bryant.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.004
<i>Hello, son.</i>

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.650
<i>I'm Coach Bryant.</i>

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.324
I know.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.602
<i>Junior, get the baby.</i>

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.290
<i>Did you always wanna be a coach?</i>

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.328
My mama wanted me
to be a preacher,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.006
but I told her that
coaching and preaching

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.605
is pretty much
the same thing.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.810
We both serve something
greater than ourselves.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.248
She went for it.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.322
<i>Oh, I could eat
that whole thing.</i>

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.126
<i>You know, a great team
shares the same heartbeat.</i>

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.770
That's what I believe.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.161
Amen.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.882
<i>If there is one thing
that has helped me as a coach,</i>

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.885
<i>Louise, it's my ability
to recognize winners,</i>

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.530
or good people
who can become winners.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.888
And that's what I see
when I look at you, Tony.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.724
And I'm talking about
winning in the larger sense.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.929
I'm talking about character.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.805
Now, you have
a strong family.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.321
That's a great advantage.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.563
And you're coached
by a special coach.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.881
Thank you, sir.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.610
So, you coming?

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.122
Where?

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.407
'Bama.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.165
<i>My coach, he played at Auburn.</i>

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.401
<i>Son...</i>

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.969
<i>...don't you want
one of these?</i>

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.610
Sure do.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.331
Louise, he ain't gonna
get one at Auburn.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.802
<i>I feel sorry for those boys.</i>

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.330
How many
black players you got?

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.008
Well, we got Wilber Jackson,
and he's a stud.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.527
<i>But I don't have white players
and black players.</i>

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.329
I have football players.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.847
That's how I see it.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.484
But in answer to your question,
not nearly enough.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.604
<i>So, why do you
see that changing?</i>

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.882
Because it's time.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.288
Are you gonna help me?

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.404
Football just hurts me
and everybody around me.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.804
Nobody's forcing you
to play football.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.406
You know that, right?

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:54.527
You can walk away right now
and let the world pass on by.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.490
But this is bigger
than football, ain't it?

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.210
Yes, sir.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.968
Some kinda great power
been given to you, son.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.367
I can see it in
them kids' faces.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.011
I know what they're thinking.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.368
"A black star like you
at a white high school?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.002
If he can do it, so can I."

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.811
That is your gift.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.363
This is your time
to do as you choose.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.331
And that's a lot to carry.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.449
So tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.323
<i>The Good Book says</i>

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.291
<i>"When there is no vision,
the people perish."</i>

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.728
<i>That means people
can't live without hope.</i>

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:52.725
<i>They need it
like they need air.</i>

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.450
<i>I say...</i>

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.002
<i>...go give it to 'em.</i>

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.290
Tony.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.089
You all know Tony Nathan.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.208
He set this up.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.850
Thanks Jeff.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.127
This is Hank.
He's got something to say.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.921
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Rutledge.</i>

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.971
We found something
at Woodlawn.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.644
Something that's bigger
than winning.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.610
<i>It's bigger than football.</i>

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.364
<i>It's why we're here.</i>

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.206
<i>It's bigger than this rivalry.</i>

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.805
We wanna share it with you.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:37.205
We wanna schedule a meeting with
your entire team and your coach.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.010
You think this
school'll understand

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.650
what we're doing here?

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.724
They won't understand,
and that's okay.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.802
Boys.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.210
<i>Coach!</i>

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.320
Shorty, Hank,
what's this all about?

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.928
We finally had
our first meeting,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.729
that tent revival thing.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.802
<i>Jeff set it up
over at the church.</i>

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.121
I went to shut it down
anyway,

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.601
<i>'cause I thought Jesus
would make my boys weak.</i>

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.250
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.920
I'm the first one
walking down the aisle,

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.363
crying like a child,
my whole team behind me.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.169
<i>My whole team.</i>

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.810
<i>How does that happen?</i>

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.405
<i>You gotta see it
with your own eyes.</i>

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.767
Unbelievable.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.842
I'm a changed man...

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.408
...and I'm sorry.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.686
Fine.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.886
I will take it.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.803
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.450
I'm glad that's over.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.127
We are gonna do camp
a little different this year.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.528
Yeah, just a little bit
different.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.891
<i>You wanna do something wild,
something truly rebellious?</i>

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.721
I like that.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.280
I want you to do something
that's never been done before.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.044
At least, not to my knowledge.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.569
<i>♪ Prepare yourself,
you know it's a must ♪</i>

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.440
<i>♪ Gotta have a friend in Jesus ♪</i>

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.045
<i>♪ So you know that... ♪♪</i>

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.730
Wouldn't be very Christian
if you stole my playbook

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.484
now, Tandy, would it?

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.164
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.163
No, it would not.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.882
<i>You know, I've always wanted
two things professionally:</i>

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:48.284
to win a championship, and to
coach a truly great player.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.364
<i>You've done both,
so which is better?</i>

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.365
Rings collect dust.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.286
That right there,
that lasts forever.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.164
<i>Two rivals, Banks and Woodlawn,
had their fall camp together.</i>

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.726
<i>Both credit a spiritual
experience as the cause</i>

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.928
<i>for the public show of unity.</i>

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.163
<i>The trouble is they can't
both enter the playoffs</i>

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.083
because they're
in the same district.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.323
Many say this rule
is unfortunate, unfair,

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.970
and should change.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.642
Mom, I got it.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.971
Hello, son.

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.601
I'm not leaving here until
you decide to come to Alabama.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.523
Excuse me.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.009
Momma!

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.929
Dear Lord,
we thank you for this food

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.764
and for your provisions.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.322
Strengthen us with it
so that we might serve you.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.926
Amen.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.686
And may I add, God in heaven,
help Tony see the light, Amen.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.130
<i>I do love corn.</i>

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.725
<i>Not me!</i>

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.689
<i>You don't like nothing!</i>

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.764
Tony.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.202
We all do
what we do in life.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.282
Go our different ways.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.848
The idea of molding men,

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:09.006
well, that means
a lot to me.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.686
And I want you to know
that I'm here to help

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.762
no matter
what choice you make.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.767
And I think you
can feel that.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.844
Now, your momma...

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.444
...showed me this.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.603
Said it was taped to a brick
thrown into this house.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.682
At my little brother.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.642
He didn't do nothing.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.883
That was all because of me.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.768
Tony, when I was
coming up here,

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:59.246
I passed a football field
full of kids.

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.168
I saw a young black boy wearin'
number 22, his head held high.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.722
That's also because of you.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.129
And I wanna
say something, son.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.603
<i>You know the difference
between you and these people?</i>

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.689
They're cowards,
and you ain't.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.484
<i>Here comes the senior tailback</i>

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.210
<i>in his first game of the year.</i>

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.362
<i>Of course,
expectations are high.</i>

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.603
<i>Dozens of college scouts
and coaches are here watching.</i>

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:00.200
<i>And, folks,
the atmosphere is electric.</i>

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.365
<i>They all want to see
what this kid can do.</i>

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.570
Do you feel unstoppable
when you run?

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.165
No, I just wanna
give Jesus Christ

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.004
all the glory for giving us
another victory.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.645
<i>What do you think
about Jeff Rutledge?</i>

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.290
Best QB in the state.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.686
<i>Fifteen second leeway,</i>

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.450
<i>Alabama with one
time out remaining</i>

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.090
<i>Rutledge on a roll.</i>

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.164
<i>Looks down the middle,
and it is...</i>

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.722
<i>Caught!
Touchdown!</i>

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.083
<i>So, Jeff, what do you
think of Touchdown Tony?</i>

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.730
I think Tony Nathan's
the best running back

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.325
in the country.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.085
<i>You've got a big game next week.</i>

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.567
<i>What do you say to those calling
it Nathan vs. Rutledge?</i>

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.689
Just two great teams.
Gonna be a great game.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.682
Good luck, Tony.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.489
Thank you.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.528
Hey, what paper'd
you say you're with?

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.648
"Sports Illustrated."

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.531
<i>The question, what happens
when an unstoppable force</i>

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.409
<i>Meets an immoveable object?</i>

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.323
<i>We're gonna find out on Friday.</i>

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.846
<i>This is the game
we've all been waiting for.</i>

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.130
<i>The top two teams in the state
facing off in a clash of titans.</i>

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.770
<i>Both are undefeated.</i>

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.401
<i>Both have one of the most highly
ranked athletes in the nation.</i>

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.528
<i>And because
of the expected crowds,</i>

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.125
<i>the game has been
moved to the heart</i>

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.646
<i>of Birmingham: Legion Field.</i>

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.802
<i>It's Nathan vs. Rutledge.</i>

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.442
Get those knees up.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.164
You spying out the battlefield
like me, huh?

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.481
How many people you think?

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.289
I don't know.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.364
Heard it could be
close to 20,000.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.690
Ain't never seen that
many people in my life.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.127
You see the "Sports Illustrated"?

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.770
Nah, man.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.970
"Faces in the Crowd,"
you're in there.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.691
I'm sure the Bear came and saw
you, gave you the ring speech.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.330
Yeah.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.085
"You ain't gonna
get one over there."

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.083
Yeah, he did.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.725
You decided?

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.326
Man, I don't even know.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.007
I've never made this big
of a decision before in my life.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.684
Me too.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.284
Well, go where you feel like you
can make the most difference.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.364
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.241
It's crazy, all these
people coming to see us.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.961
What's so special about us?

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.327
<i>We're a symbol.</i>

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.323
We give them hope.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.689
I ain't seen you in school.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.007
I got suspended.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.048
Why?

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.487
Because I wanted to.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:33.962
Ain't nobody gonna
bus me to that prison.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:40.127
That's the only way
I saw out, that's all.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.443
<i>Who's been doing this to you?</i>

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.647
You need to leave.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.688
Right now, please.

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.081
Go.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.529
<i>Touchdown Tony Nathan.</i>

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.241
What you doing here,
digging in the trash?

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.281
<i>Tony!</i>

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:15.925
That might be your daughter,
but that's the woman I love.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.401
<i>Did you actually read through this?</i>

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.164
<i>Come on.</i>

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.642
<i>Parents are calling it
abrasive and overreaching.</i>

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.245
<i>I didn't force anyone to do anything.</i>

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.890
You know what this is.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.530
<i>It's retribution.</i>

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.730
<i>Yes, I know, but I am
compelled to deal with it.</i>

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.282
<i>Look at the changes
to these boys, Owen.</i>

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.885
It is amazing to see.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.769
It is.

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.764
But this is
a public high school.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.002
Mr. Whitehurst.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.370
And you are?

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:53.808
I'm Linda, sir.
I'm a teacher.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.008
And What is this?

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.082
It's a prayer meeting.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.685
Prayer meeting?

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.524
The kids started it
themselves Friday night

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.001
and it just hasn't stopped.

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.605
<i>God, thank you for the change</i>

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.330
<i>that you've brought
upon this city.</i>

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.528
Thank you for the change that
you've brought upon this school.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.080
Thank you for the change that
you have brought upon my life.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.367
<i>Are you leading this?</i>

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.568
No, sir.
I was an atheist last week.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:21.402
The kids,
they're leading me.

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:24.808
It's spreading
all over the school.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.042
There's even a rally
tonight at Legion Field

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.246
if you want to come.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.362
Coach is setting it up.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.848
I just wanna thank
Coach Gerelds and his team

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.048
for putting this together.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.841
<i>Thank you, Coach.</i>

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.968
Would you look at this?

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.042
I mean, take a look around.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.248
Can you believe it?

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.927
This is what happens
when God shows up.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.328
<i>Now, a couple years back,
I went to this thing called</i>

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:17.291
"The Explo '72" in Dallas.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.002
<i>I joined a hundred thousand
other people just like us.</i>

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.646
<i>Up until that point
in my life,</i>

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.487
<i>I guess I kinda
felt insignificant.</i>

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:33.326
I felt like my life
doesn't matter.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.926
<i>Then the last night of the week,</i>

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.006
there in the big Cotton Bowl,
they shut off the lights.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.604
<i>And in that darkness,
Reverend Graham lit a candle.</i>

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.160
<i>A single candle.</i>

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:55.848
<i>I was standing in the very
back of the stadium,</i>

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.129
but I could see that light.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:06.203
<i>And I realized that my
life is not insignificant.</i>

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.005
My life matters.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.283
<i>One light became two
and two became ten</i>

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:23.002
<i>and ten became
a hundred thousand.</i>

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.367
<i>Well, people in Dallas started
calling the fire department</i>

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.010
<i>and the police department,</i>

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.289
saying,
"The Cotton Bowl's on fire!"

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.408
Well, you know what?

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.442
They were right.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:40.762
<i>A hundred thousand candles
burning as one.</i>

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:44.162
"Time Magazine" said
that the Jesus revolution...

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:49.326
that's what they called us...
has a symbol.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.004
This is our symbol.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:58.606
Because there is one way.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.128
<i>We're not gathered here
united tonight</i>

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:09.684
because of the name
of our teams or of our schools,

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.764
but because of the name
above all names:

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.920
Jesus.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.048
Jesus.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.523
<i>One person alone in the dark,</i>

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:33.767
<i>willing to speak the truth
when it's not popular,</i>

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:39.563
one person willing to speak
the truth when it is not safe,

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:42.644
when there is much at stake.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:49.084
<i>Look around you.</i>

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.960
We're not alone.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.410
This is what happens
when God shows up.

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.448
<i>Well, here he comes.</i>

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.966
<i>Coach, so glad
you could join us.</i>

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.247
I believe you know
everybody here.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.563
This is Brenda Halley,
lawyer from Montgomery.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.721
Ma'am.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.968
Why don't you take your seat
and let us get started.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.565
<i>Go right ahead.</i>

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.483
Did you have an evangelist
of some sort

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.610
speak to the team
this year and last?

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.205
Yes.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.850
Was this activity
school sponsored?

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.809
<i>Was it required?</i>

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.167
Well, it just
sorta happened.

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.846
It wasn't required, at least
not the way that I saw.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.730
<i>Last year, did you recite
the Lord's Prayer</i>

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.600
before and after each game?

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.250
Yes, we did.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.845
<i>Did you dismiss players</i>

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.285
because they didn't
wanna be a part of this?

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.282
Yes, he did.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.362
That is in outright lie.
Your son quit.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.771
Coach, are you aware
of the U.S. Supreme Court

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.126
ruling on this issue?

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.770
<i>Because you're in clear
violation of it.</i>

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.042
And whether you like it or not,
you are breaking the law.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.326
<i>See, I think this has more to do</i>

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.641
with the color
of my tailback than God.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.762
<i>I want you to stop
all religious activities</i>

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:10.525
until this board has taken this
matter under full review.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.926
You mean on school property?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.847
I mean all activities, otherwise
you will be removed as coach

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.888
<i>from Woodlawn High School.</i>

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.042
<i>Which may already
be the case after this matter</i>

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.122
<i>has been fully reviewed
by the board.</i>

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.168
Can I come in?

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.891
<i>You know,
I had my first coaching job</i>

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.002
when I was 22 years old.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.445
This is the only job
that I have ever had.

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.285
It's all I know how to do.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.450
What can I do for you?

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.130
That's what
I wanted to ask you.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.521
How do you mean?

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.682
I don't like it when
my teammates get hit.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.808
<i>Same goes for my coach.</i>

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.450
Thank you, Tony.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.320
<i>I think I'm gonna get hit
no matter what I do.</i>

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.404
I got some tough
decisions to make.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.204
<i>You once told me that
winning solves everything.</i>

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.805
I don't know if
I believe that anymore.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.888
They do.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.803
So, let me help you
carry this.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.689
How are you gonna do that?

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.802
By winning you
a championship.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.284
All right.

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.169
All right.
Let's go beat Banks.

<i>Use it.</i>

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:52.886
<i>Use that sound.</i>

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.803
<i>We need another half-hour coach.</i>

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.405
Another half-hour?

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.720
We're getting 'em
in as quick as we can.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.131
<i>How many people are out there?</i>

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.202
<i>A lot.</i>

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.362
Coach.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:12.120
Can I have a moment
with my son?

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.290
There's a lot of people
out there, Dad.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.249
<i>I know.</i>

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.927
But they ain't here
to see Woodlawn vs. Banks.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.004
<i>They're here to see you.</i>

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.322
You've given a lot of people
hope, and I'm proud of you.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.802
Look at me.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.842
I'm proud of you.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.651
Win or lose,
you're my son.

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.325
How do you feel?

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.845
Nervous.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.920
Don't be.

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.485
How many people
are out there?

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.602
<i>Tony, come on.</i>

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.802
You'll see.

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.328
We're gonna do this one way.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.970
All right, let's do this,
come on.

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.245
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.322
All right, here we go.
Here we go.

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.003
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.560
Tony! Tony! Tony!

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.766
<i>One way, boys! Let's do this!</i>

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.770
<i>Welcome to Legion Field
in Birmingham, Alabama,</i>

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:16.411
<i>where history is being made
here tonight.</i>

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.723
<i>Never before and perhaps
never again have there been</i>

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.361
<i>so many people to see
a high school football game.</i>

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.841
<i>And they're not here
just to see two teams.</i>

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.241
<i>They are here to see players,</i>

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.448
<i>and one just entered
the stadium.</i>

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.444
<i>Number 22, Touchdown Tony.</i>

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.568
<i>And you can hear the cheers
for this young man.</i>

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.847
<i>They are deafening.</i>

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.649
<i>And the Banks Jets
have just landed.</i>

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:53.406
<i>Here they come, led by senior
superstar quarterback,</i>

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.130
<i>Jeff Rutledge.</i>

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.329
<i>Legion Field is all
but full to capacity.</i>

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.721
<i>There is a line of cars
still outside,</i>

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.167
<i>stretching as far
as the eye can see,</i>

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.561
<i>and this crowd
is continuing to build.</i>

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.531
<i>As a matter of fact, I've
already seen seven SEC coaches</i>

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:12.968
<i>in attendance here today.</i>

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.441
Auburn.

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.887
They'll let anybody in.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.049
<i>♪ O'er the land of the free ♪</i>

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:33.129
<i>♪ And the home of the brave ♪♪</i>

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.889
Let's go, Hank.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.689
Where we going?

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:49.366
To do something
wild and rebellious.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:54.764
Shorty!

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.048
Pray for us, Hank.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.645
Really?

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.081
Pray for us.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.849
What are we doing?

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.242
Giving credit
where credit is due.

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.322
Let's pray.

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:23.329
Will you pray with me?

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:29.601
Our Father
who art in heaven,

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.842
<i>hallowed be thy name.</i>

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.207
<i>Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...</i>

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.320
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.169
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.722
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:53.964
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:57.965
<i>For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory.</i>

01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.610
For ever and ever.

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.409
Amen.

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:03.084
<i>One Way!</i>

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.367
Amen.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.566
Good luck, Coach.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.483
Amen.

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:25.126
Take a look around, y'all.
Take this all in.

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.884
<i>This is something special.</i>

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.405
<i>Let's go do what
we do, all right?</i>

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.005
Spider 2-Y Banana
on one.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.730
Spider 2-Y Banana
on one, ready?

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.370
Hike!

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.808
Pass!
Pass!

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.123
There you go!

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.282
You all right?
Good hit.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.040
<i>You gotta release the ball quicker.</i>

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.684
You're holding
onto it too much.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.843
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.445
You got this.

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.288
<i>Both teams are at a standstill,</i>

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:00.364
<i>neither one able
to break through.</i>

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.604
<i>Rutledge drops back to pass.</i>

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.205
<i>Looks right, lets it fly.</i>

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.529
<i>A perfect spiral,
a beautiful throw...</i>

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.890
<i>And is caught!</i>

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.804
<i>Finds its target
at the ten-yard line,</i>

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.450
<i>Into the end zone.</i>

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.364
<i>Banks is first on the board.
Touchdown!</i>

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.966
<i>The master of offense,
Shorty White,</i>

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.850
<i>has willed his team through
and into the end zone.</i>

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.445
<i>That's okay. Let's get it back.</i>

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.807
<i>Let's get it back.
Don't turn over the ball.</i>

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.848
<i>Positive yardage, okay?
We can break one.</i>

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.524
You can break one in.

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.161
<i>Halftime,
and the score remains the same.</i>

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.009
<i>Banks has been the only team to
find the end zone here tonight.</i>

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.206
Coach, I know
what you're thinking,

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.645
but we gotta do something.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.370
This ain't working.

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.690
Hey, time out.

01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:00.686
Boys, just
take a breath, okay?

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:02.330
Just breathe.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.131
<i>Look around you.
Savor this moment.</i>

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.410
<i>Okay, Mum,
I Right 25 Blast, okay?</i>

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.642
<i>Let's go do it.</i>

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.364
Nathan...

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.963
What do you feel
but you can't say, huh?

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.090
What do you want to say
to all of these people?

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.364
You say it
when you run, Tony.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.442
You say it when you run.

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:35.000
Now, this is your moment.
This is your time.

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.650
Yes, sir.

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.324
So, you go and take it.
You go and take it!

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.004
Yes, sir!

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.570
Hike!

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.685
<i>It's to Nathan.</i>

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.091
<i>Nothing doing
on the right side.</i>

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.764
<i>He'll change direction.
Shakes off the tackle.</i>

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.410
<i>Finds a hole.</i>

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.087
<i>And he's brought down
after a gain of five.</i>

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.761
He's still up!

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:34.008
<i>He's still on his feet!
He breaks another tackle.</i>

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.969
<i>He's moving up
the head of steam.</i>

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.280
<i>He's past midfield.</i>

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.046
<i>He leaps over the linebacker
like Superman.</i>

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.367
<i>Heading to the far corner,
he's got one man to beat.</i>

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.005
<i>There he goes.</i>

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.082
<i>He's gone!</i>

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.443
<i>Touchdown, Woodlawn!</i>

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.649
<i>Touchdown, Tony Nathan!</i>

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.326
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.530
Tony! Tony!
Tony! Tony!

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.244
<i>It was amazing.</i>

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.811
<i>You could feel it in
the stadium all over.</i>

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.645
<i>Forty-two thousand fans at
a high school football game.</i>

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.245
<i>Not even the play-offs.</i>

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.530
<i>I mean, none of the tickets
were pre-purchased.</i>

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:19.285
<i>They had to send home
20,000 people.</i>

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.885
<i>You know,
a "National Geographic" reporter</i>

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.530
<i>who was coming through
even wrote about it</i>

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:28.243
<i>and he said it was
undeniably spiritual.</i>

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.322
<i>Supernatural even.</i>

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:37.922
It was life-changing for me.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.482
It was unbelievable.

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:47.402
So?

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.284
<i>So, what?</i>

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.930
Did you win?

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.842
No, we did not.

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.650
Look, I'll have these
policies ready for you

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.722
first thing in the morning.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.531
So, what's the answer?

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.602
<i>Do you believe
in miracles?</i>

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.562
Yes, I do.

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.602
I am one.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.322
Well, thanks for the story.

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.241
<i>Hi! Honey!</i>

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.924
<i>Where in the world
have you been?</i>

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.482
<i>You are late, mister.
The game's already started.</i>

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.928
<i>I just wanted to walk.
It's such a beautiful day.</i>

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.766
All right, well,
there you go, honey.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.525
Just not today.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.602
Okay.

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.443
<i>Penn State and Alabama
in the Super Dome</i>

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:42.127
<i>in New Orleans
in this ABC Sports exclusive.</i>

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.122
Alabama...

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.531
<i>There he is.</i>

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:47.809
<i>Ah, there he is!
There's Tony, Todd!</i>

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.803
<i>They call him
Touchdown Tony Nathan.</i>

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:52.008
<i>He's home-grown,
right in Birmingham,</i>

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.401
<i>and he can break the long run
almost anywhere at any time.</i>

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.124
Tony Nathan.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:00.006
<i>Here comes Alabama.</i>

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.003
<i>Here is the offensive
back field</i>

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.003
<i>for the Crimson Tide of Alabama.</i>

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:06.890
<i>The quarterback, Major Ogilvie,
is the other half back,</i>

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.122
<i>and Steve Whitman
is the full back.</i>

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.242
Allyson!

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.764
Did I miss anything?

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.083
<i>Oftentimes he's the
money man in this call.</i>

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.162
Now that is
Alabama football.

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:04.083
<i>That was the last play
of the ball game.</i>

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.491
<i>It is over.</i>

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:10.566
<i>Alabama has defeated Penn State
by a score of 14 to 7.</i>

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.126
<i>Alabama has won six times
in the Sugar Bowl.</i>

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.043
<i>The Bear goes for a ride.</i>

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.609
Hello?

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:51.846
<i>Hey Coach, I told you
I'd win you a championship.</i>

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:56.050
Tony.

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.690
Did you see it?

01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.524
I would not have
missed it for the world.

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.125
I am so proud of you.

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.124
- All right, Tony!
- Tony, you won us a big one.

01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:08.961
<i>I don't have much time,</i>

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.441
<i>but I wanted
to tell you something.</i>

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.887
<i>I'm gonna ask Johnnie
to marry me after graduation.</i>

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:18.124
That's just great, Tony.
Congratulations.

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.806
<i>How's the team this year?</i>

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.121
I'm not coaching anymore.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.725
<i>I needed some time
away from it.</i>

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.160
<i>I'm selling insurance right
across the street from Woodlawn.</i>

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:30.727
Just gives me some
more time with my family.

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:36.449
All right, I respect that.

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:40.286
<i>They're calling for me,
I gotta go.</i>

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:45.571
I love you, Coach.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:50.851
I love you, too, son.

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:54.641
<i>I don't know what kind of
insurance salesman you are,</i>

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:57.883
<i>but you were born
to be a coach.</i>

01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:00.645
One of the best
I've ever had.

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.042
<i>Someone once told me
we all have a purpose.</i>

01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.808
<i>Maybe it's time to start
living yours again.</i>

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.604
<i>Gotta go.</i>

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:03.922
<i>Look around you.</i>

01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:08.162

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.801
