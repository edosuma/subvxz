WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:04.505
Aaron, I mean this
from the very bottom of my heart.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.730
I love you.

00:05.907 --> 00:07.067
Nice try.

00:07.242 --> 00:10.473
I've gotten more emotion
out of my car's navigational system.

00:10.645 --> 00:12.806
You know, I knew it was childish
to practice on my cat.

00:12.981 --> 00:14.471
I should be doing this in the mirror.

00:14.649 --> 00:16.480
And in fact, I'll do it one better.

00:17.886 --> 00:20.184
Aaron, I've been wanting
to tell you this for a long time.

00:20.355 --> 00:21.788
I love you.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.856
Aw, that's great, Sabrina. Thanks.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.617
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the dreaded thanks.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.353
- Try again. I love you.
- Ditto.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.521
No. No "ditto." No "right back at you."

00:30.698 --> 00:32.631
No, "yeah, same to you,
but more of it."

00:32.800 --> 00:35.428
- Just tell me you love me.
- I love you.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.700
Oh, well, that's really sudden,
but, heh...

00:40.275 --> 00:41.708
...I love you too.

00:46.981 --> 00:49.245
What? I look hot today.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:28.823 --> 01:34.125
"Insert the gunta hooks
into the abba locks and rotate the..."

01:34.295 --> 01:35.592
What does this word mean?

01:35.763 --> 01:38.755
Oh, that's Swedish for
"We're up a fjord without a paddle."

01:39.500 --> 01:41.764
So, what do you think?

01:41.936 --> 01:45.167
Nice, but you're a little too put together
to be putting things together.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.604
But I look perfect
for having dinner at my boyfriend's.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.799
Aaron's cooking.

01:48.977 --> 01:52.344
And for dessert,
I'm finally gonna tell him I love him.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.876
- First?
- Uh-uh-uh.

01:56.050 --> 01:59.349
- You're going to say "I love you" first?
- Yeah.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.216
Oh, never ever say "I love you" first.

02:02.390 --> 02:06.417
Unless, of course, he's just given you
something sparkly and expensive.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.619
Or he's got the last parachute.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.924
But I do love him
and I want him to know.

02:11.099 --> 02:13.499
It's the only way to take
our relationship to the next level.

02:13.668 --> 02:15.898
And it's not like he's gonna laugh
in my face, right?

02:17.705 --> 02:20.173
This is where you say "right"
and nod your head furiously.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.673
Right, but I wouldn't rule out
an incredibly awkward silence

02:22.844 --> 02:24.812
followed by a rapid change
of subject.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.640
[CLOCK TICKING]

02:26.814 --> 02:28.975
Hey, who wants coffee?

02:29.150 --> 02:30.981
Sabrina, are you sure
you wanna do this?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.983
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.712
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

02:34.889 --> 02:37.756
Anyway, it... We...

02:37.925 --> 02:41.019
- Ha, ha. What are you trying to say?
- Nothing.

02:41.396 --> 02:43.421
Uh, wait. No, there is something.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.589
Aaron, we've been seeing each other
for a while now,

02:45.767 --> 02:48.235
and there's something
I've really been wanting to tell you.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.363
Aaron, I love...

02:52.473 --> 02:54.441
I love...

02:54.609 --> 02:56.804
I love the nightlife.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.236
Okay, we could go dancing
after dessert.

02:59.414 --> 03:02.474
Phew. And here I was afraid
there'd be this big awkward silence.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.345
- So, what do you love?
- Ha, ha.

03:04.519 --> 03:06.282
Uh, I'm not talking about
whiskers on kittens.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.479
Um. Okay, things that I love.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.886
Well, obviously, I love music.

03:11.059 --> 03:13.823
And, uh...
Oh, I'm a big fan of old movies.

03:13.995 --> 03:17.226
Oh. You know what I really love?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.067
The Red Sox.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.504
I can't believe we actually did it.

03:25.673 --> 03:29.575
And, may I add,
we only had to use half the screws.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.540
Hey, guys. Sabrina around?

03:31.713 --> 03:33.476
No, she ran out of here
to have dinner with...

03:33.648 --> 03:36.845
A friend. Less than a friend.
An acquaintance.

03:37.018 --> 03:38.883
A quasi-chum with a peg leg.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.848
Morgan, Harvey knows about Aaron.

03:42.023 --> 03:44.617
Well, he does now. Ugh, way to go.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.317
Yeah, I know all about
Sabrina and Aaron,

03:47.495 --> 03:48.723
how happy they are,

03:48.896 --> 03:51.228
how they spend every
waking moment together.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.094
And how every time
I hear his flipping name,

03:53.267 --> 03:56.236
I wanna break things
into a thousand pieces.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.470
Kind of like that?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.108
Harvey, you have a problem.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.538
Yeah, I know.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.407
I'm in love with a woman
who loves another man.

04:06.581 --> 04:09.345
I'd give anything
for a second chance with Sabrina.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.179
Breaking up with her
was the biggest regret of my life.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.752
Harvey, I wish there was something
I could say.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.028
I hate to see you broken up like this.

04:21.195 --> 04:24.596
But if that's how you really feel,
then you need to tell her.

04:24.766 --> 04:27.894
Yeah, before she left to tell Aaron that
she loved him would have been ideal.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.735
What?

04:29.904 --> 04:32.498
That's it.
I can't wait around any longer.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.903
I have to say it. I have to tell her.

04:35.076 --> 04:37.544
And linguini, fettuccini.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.304
Boston terriers.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.710
Uh, those Japanese monkeys
that take steam baths.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.484
SABRINA:
<i>Why won't he say it?</i>

04:44.652 --> 04:46.176
Oh, and vintage cars. Yes.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.549
Okay, I get it.
You got a lot of love to spread around.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.691
Okay, well, I told you
all the things that I love.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.349
- What do you love?
SABRINA: <i>You, you, you.</i>

04:53.528 --> 04:55.086
Nothing comes to mind.

04:55.263 --> 04:57.390
Well, hopefully you'll love dessert.

05:01.269 --> 05:02.293
Only if it's a sheet cake

05:02.470 --> 05:04.461
with "I love you, Sabrina"
spelled out in sparklers.

05:04.639 --> 05:06.038
This is ridiculous.

05:06.207 --> 05:09.108
<i>Feelings of love I cannot find</i>
<i>Help me hear what's on Aaron's mind</i>

05:10.478 --> 05:12.309
AARON:
<i>She looks so amazing in that dress.</i>

05:12.480 --> 05:14.004
This old thing? Thanks.

05:14.182 --> 05:15.410
What? I didn't say anything.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.914
Neither did I. But I'll start.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.608
Uh, penny for your thoughts?

05:18.786 --> 05:19.810
A penny? Ha-ha-ha.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.751
You know, I once got a quarter
for sticking my tongue on a hot pepper.

05:22.924 --> 05:24.858
AARON:
<i>Oh, my God, I'm such a moron.</i>

05:25.026 --> 05:26.050
Oh, that's not a big deal.

05:26.227 --> 05:28.161
I once stuck my tongue
to the inside of a freezer.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.455
SABRINA:
<i>I'm such a moron.</i>

05:29.630 --> 05:31.029
AARON:
<i>Wonder if I should tell her.</i>

05:31.199 --> 05:33.133
SABRINA:
<i>Yes. Tell her, tell her.</i>

05:33.301 --> 05:34.859
AARON:
<i>I'm not sure how to put it.</i>

05:35.036 --> 05:37.402
<i>I guess I should just be brave</i>
<i>and see how she reacts.</i>

05:37.572 --> 05:39.437
SABRINA: <i>Come on.</i>
<i>What do you want, a drum roll?</i>

05:39.607 --> 05:40.631
<i>Just say it.</i>

05:40.808 --> 05:42.935
I feel like there's something
you want to tell me.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.101
Actually, I do.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.247
Sabrina,
you got something right there.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.618
Thanks.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.518
SABRINA:
<i>The only two things he doesn't love:</i>

05:56.691 --> 05:59.182
<i>Half-chewed spinach and me.</i>

06:00.094 --> 06:01.789
Well, there you go.

06:01.963 --> 06:03.123
That's perfect.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.765
Now can you take it apart
and put it together in my room?

06:06.601 --> 06:08.796
She's home.
Remember, bold and decisive.

06:08.970 --> 06:10.870
Unless she's already told him
that she loves him,

06:11.038 --> 06:13.063
then just finish the cabinet
and slink out the back.

06:17.178 --> 06:18.202
Hey, Harvey.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.904
I knew those two wouldn't get
this thing together on their own.

06:21.082 --> 06:22.913
So how was your night?

06:23.084 --> 06:24.108
Oh, I've had better.

06:24.285 --> 06:26.583
You know, sometimes things don't go
quite like you planned.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.312
I'm really sorry to hear that.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.286
Thanks. Good night.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.982
Sabrina, wait.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.218
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.419
Oh, it's not that bad.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.292
You know, it's not my taste,
but it will go perfect in Morgan's room.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.592
It's not about the cabinet.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.833
It's...

06:42.003 --> 06:43.493
It's...

06:44.305 --> 06:46.739
Just that I glued my shoes
to the floor.

06:46.908 --> 06:49.399
Well, I'm sure you're still doing better
than the Blunder Twins.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.068
Ooh, don't tell them I said that.
Good night.

06:53.047 --> 06:54.514
SALEM:
Oh, you're up awfully early.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.774
Never a good sign.

06:55.950 --> 06:58.111
And you're home awfully early.
Slow night?

06:58.286 --> 07:00.413
Eh, the usual. Cruised the alleys,

07:00.588 --> 07:02.681
knocked over a trash can,
flower pot.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.347
Well, I had a lousy night.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.187
I totally chickened out when I tried
to tell Aaron that I love him.

07:07.361 --> 07:10.387
Fortunately, I found the perfect coach
to help me express how I really feel:

07:10.564 --> 07:11.588
Cyrano de Bergerac.

07:11.766 --> 07:15.463
The big-schnozzed wordsmith
who always knows exactly what to say?

07:15.636 --> 07:16.660
That's the one.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.203
But I've found a spell
for a slightly more personal version.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.965
<i>Uh, I can't come up with</i>
<i>The words alone</i>

07:21.142 --> 07:22.507
<i>So send me a Cyrano of my own</i>

07:24.078 --> 07:26.069
Greetings.
Cyrano-Sabrina at your service.

07:26.247 --> 07:29.011
Whoa.
That is one huge, ha, ha, cape.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.516
Thank you. Hopefully it doesn't distract
from my more prominent feature.

07:32.687 --> 07:35.053
Are you kidding? It's hardly "noseable."
I mean noticeable.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.782
I detect from the stammering speech
and inarticulate phrasing

07:37.959 --> 07:39.790
that the lady needs help in wooing.

07:39.961 --> 07:41.792
Actually,
I think he's already been wooed.

07:41.963 --> 07:43.863
I just need to tell him I "wuv" him.
Love him.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.055
Have you tried:

07:45.232 --> 07:48.201
"Your eyes are like two flowers
blooming in the morning sun"?

07:48.369 --> 07:50.894
No, not exactly. Shouldn't I know
how he's gonna respond

07:51.072 --> 07:53.063
before I blurt out something
that embarrassing?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.834
Ah, so the real fear emerges:
Rejection.

07:56.010 --> 07:58.535
Let's see if I can find
the most articulate way to put this...

07:58.713 --> 07:59.737
Duh.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.905
Look, I just need you to do
a little investigating.

08:02.083 --> 08:06.042
You know, nose around a little bit.
I mean, well, your nose is lovely.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.053
Your nostrils are like two flowers
blooming in the morning...

08:09.223 --> 08:10.781
Nice try.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.920
Okay. Now, remember,
you're my cousin Sarah.

08:14.095 --> 08:16.222
And you're, uh, on a break
from your day job

08:16.397 --> 08:17.455
at the Renaissance fair.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.825
Excellent. Renaissance fair.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.661
Perhaps my duties include jousting.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.496
I know, I started out as an apprentice

08:22.670 --> 08:24.934
for a cocksure,
yet dainty blacksmith who...

08:25.106 --> 08:26.505
Okay, enough of your back-story.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.539
Fear not.
Just leaveth me alone with him

08:28.709 --> 08:30.472
and I shall discern
his feelings for you.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.975
Me liketh.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.044
Ooh, here he comes now.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.508
My, he's a strapping comely lad.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.880
Okay, one more thing.
Don't talk like that.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.078
Hi.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.984
- Hi, Aaron. This is my cousin, Sarah.
- Mm.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.617
Nose to meet you.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.853
I mean nice. Nice to meet you.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.587
Be not embarrassed.

08:50.765 --> 08:52.528
My nose shows character,
it shows spine.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.396
It shows heart, but only if I tip my head
way, way back.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.400
Ha-ha-ha. She's funny.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.898
Listen, I'm sorry. I can't stay.
I gotta get back to the club.

09:01.075 --> 09:04.374
I've got Sixpence None the Richer
playing and I am swamped.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.877
Actually, if you're still in town
maybe you'd like to come?

09:07.048 --> 09:09.573
Oh, she'd love to.
Sarah's really into music.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.650
Especially all the
behind-the-scenes stuff, yeah.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.582
I'm sure she has a thousand questions
for you.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.052
So, uh, thanks for asking her
to tag along. See you.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.088
Yeah, I didn't actually mean...

09:18.259 --> 09:20.090
She's rather fleet of foot, no?

09:20.261 --> 09:21.592
Where'd you say you're from again?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.457
Jersey.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.823
- Oh, hey, Harvey, what are you...?
- Here.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.060
- What's this?
- You'll understand when you open it.

09:29.804 --> 09:33.069
Earrings in the shape of sea otters?

09:34.608 --> 09:37.270
I thought you "otter" have them?

09:37.945 --> 09:40.573
And I think you "otter" start wearing
your helmet at hockey.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.511
Morgan.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.850
Otter earrings?

09:47.021 --> 09:50.013
You promised me a bracelet
that would make Sabrina's heart melt.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.018
It turned out
it made my heart melt too.

09:53.194 --> 09:55.685
And it matched my outfit.
Pretty, huh?

09:58.399 --> 10:00.094
Yeah, okay, Perry, that looks great.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.827
Yes, it does, if by great
you mean the lighting is too dim

10:03.003 --> 10:04.470
and the sightlines are dreadful.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.165
Ha, ha. Excuse me.
I've been doing this a while and that...

10:09.310 --> 10:11.301
Yeah, Perry, you wanna bring
the lights up a little

10:11.479 --> 10:14.073
and, uh, make the sightlines
less, um, dreadful?

10:15.583 --> 10:16.675
Thanks.

10:16.851 --> 10:20.116
I'm sure you would have caught that
along with that wild eyebrow.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.384
Hey, check out that nose.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.422
Hey, guys, come on.
What kind of remark is that?

10:25.593 --> 10:27.356
An extremely unimaginative one.

10:27.528 --> 10:28.825
A better insult would have been:

10:28.996 --> 10:30.793
"You could check into that nose."

10:30.965 --> 10:32.694
Your lack of creativity is appalling.

10:32.867 --> 10:35.495
Next time try,
"Nice nose. Did you keep the peel?"

10:35.669 --> 10:39.105
Or perhaps, "Do you smell Munich?"

10:39.273 --> 10:40.638
Okay, okay, I get the point.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.799
Okay, now off with you.
I feel a sneeze coming on.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.403
Wow, you really know
how to take care of yourself.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.605
And you're certainly not afraid
to speak your mind.

10:48.782 --> 10:49.806
I like that.

10:49.984 --> 10:52.851
Good, because I'm also not afraid
to thrash a man at a game of pool.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.456
Well, I also hope you're not afraid
of losing.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.123
Because I am.

11:00.294 --> 11:01.556
What is taking so long?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.856
I should have heard from Cyrano
hours ago.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.931
Yeah, about that.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.194
So when's the last time
you read <i>Cyrano de Bergerac?</i>

11:09.370 --> 11:10.962
It's been a while, but I remember it.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.266
You know, inner beauty, love wins,
big schnoz, blah-blah-blah.

11:14.441 --> 11:18.844
Well, it's possible the blah-blah-blah
was the creamy nougat of the story.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.908
Because the person Cyrano helps woo
ends up loving him.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.711
What? I'm the wrong character?

11:26.220 --> 11:27.346
Oh, this is just fiction.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.388
I mean, there's no way that...
I have nothing to worry about, right?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.155
Right.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.994
Whoa.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.226
Sarah, what are you doing?

11:42.403 --> 11:43.995
I mean, what just happened?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.901
Obviously, you have a short memory.
It went something like this.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.735
Uh... Whoa, we can't do this.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.376
I mean, don't get me wrong.
You're a...

11:50.544 --> 11:53.672
You're a great girl, but I'm sorry
if I gave you the wrong impression.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.782
Look, I've gotta go check on something
backstage, but, um...

11:56.951 --> 12:00.682
Look, you and I, we need to, um,
talk about this later, okay?

12:01.222 --> 12:04.453
As you wish,
I shall not move from this...

12:05.025 --> 12:06.458
- Spot.
- Hi.

12:06.627 --> 12:08.060
I was hoping to get a little update.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.390
You know, how's the band?
Do you like the food?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.623
Does Aaron love me
with a love that lasts forever?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.267
The river runs its course.

12:14.435 --> 12:16.369
That really doesn't tell me anything.

12:16.537 --> 12:18.437
I can report
that he is a worthy swain.

12:18.606 --> 12:20.597
Okay.
The river thing was actually clearer.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.469
He appears to be
quite smitten with you.

12:22.643 --> 12:24.008
Oh, good.

12:24.178 --> 12:27.045
And I can also tell you
that he is a splendid kisser.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.546
Yeah, isn't he?
Oh, I love that about... What?

12:29.717 --> 12:33.118
In fact, I would have to say his lips
are like two flowers blossoming in...

12:33.287 --> 12:35.312
Back up.
There is no way he kissed you.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.717
You must've kissed him.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.120
Well, it takes two to tango.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.384
You kissed and danced?

12:43.364 --> 12:45.992
Hey, come back here.
I'm not done with you yet.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.098
Where are you going?

12:48.269 --> 12:49.964
Well, there's been a slight change
in plans.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.729
I've decided I'm keeping Aaron
for myself.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.931
Oh, not so fast, "Pi-nose-io."
Are you saying Aaron hit on you?

12:55.109 --> 12:57.475
I'm saying men are easily seduced
by words.

12:57.645 --> 12:59.977
And words are, after all,
my stock and trade.

13:00.414 --> 13:02.177
Well, I don't care what you
or your words say.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.611
I totally trust Aaron.

13:03.784 --> 13:04.910
But just in case...

13:05.085 --> 13:07.610
<i>I need to get the real story</i>
<i>So give my nose a greater glory</i>

13:09.490 --> 13:11.720
Anyone for a ring toss?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.118
Gracious.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.090
Oh, I'm a small-nosed freak.

13:18.899 --> 13:22.357
No more messing around. This is
what I should've done from the start.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.231
- Who are you?
- Exactly.

13:24.405 --> 13:25.633
I'm a changed man.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.239
No more Mr. Nice-Guy.

13:27.408 --> 13:29.467
And I think you're making
a big mistake with Aaron.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.874
You claim to have feelings for him,
but you can't bring yourself to tell him.

13:33.047 --> 13:35.914
Well, I have no problem
telling you how I feel.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.347
I love you, Sabrina.

13:40.754 --> 13:44.019
Whoo! Oh, that is much easier
without the face kebab.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.552
- Sabrina?
- Oh, thank heavens, no.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.986
I am Sabrina's personal Cyrano.

13:50.164 --> 13:52.758
Artist, poet, musician,
and as of this morning,

13:52.933 --> 13:54.093
Renaissance fair roustabout.

13:54.868 --> 13:58.065
Why couldn't I fall in love
with a sprite or a wood nymph?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.536
If you'll excuse me,
my work here is not complete.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.505
Have you a conveyance of any sort?

14:02.676 --> 14:06.635
- Um, got a car.
- Oh, good enough.

14:06.814 --> 14:08.247
Hey, wait.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.944
I know your Sabrina's Cyrano,

14:10.117 --> 14:13.382
but do you think you could give me
any advice on how to win her back?

14:13.554 --> 14:16.455
Well, Sabrina is a complex girl,

14:16.623 --> 14:17.885
a lass with many facets.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.925
- A woman...
- I don't really have time for a soliloquy.

14:21.095 --> 14:23.086
I'm guessing since
she brought in professional help,

14:23.263 --> 14:25.663
she'll be telling Aaron
she loves him any minute now.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.596
A grand gesture would do the trick.

14:27.768 --> 14:30.328
Godspeed, good Sir Nice Guy.

14:30.504 --> 14:34.133
Oh, by the way, you are a much
better kisser than Aaron.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.072
You might wanna mention that
to Sabrina.

14:37.578 --> 14:38.909
Roxie, Morgan.

14:40.848 --> 14:43.544
Is everything all right? I thought
I heard Sabrina slam out of here.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.117
Everything's gonna be great.
I just need to borrow your car.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.880
- What happened to yours?
- Yeah, you can't just run in here

14:49.056 --> 14:51.149
and take our car
without some explanation.

14:51.592 --> 14:53.355
It's a long complicated story.

14:53.527 --> 14:55.927
- See, Sabrina...
- Oh, just take it.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.723
Wait. What about Sabrina?

14:57.898 --> 15:01.800
Let's just say drastic times
call for drastic measures.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.834
Wish me luck.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.138
We've gotta do something.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.866
We got Harvey all hopped up
about telling Sabrina how he feels.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.738
If he does anything to Aaron,
Sabrina will never forgive us.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.072
Fine.

15:13.247 --> 15:15.215
Wow, this thing's like a divining rod.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.474
Aaron, we have to talk.

15:16.917 --> 15:21.820
I mean, uh, prithee, worthy swain-y.
We must converse-eth.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.457
Yeah, I still wanna have a talk
about that kiss.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.923
Aha! So you did kiss her?
I mean me.

15:27.094 --> 15:31.030
Look, for the last time.
I didn't kiss you, you kissed me.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.132
Oh, good answer, good answer.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.461
But as they say, uh,
takes two to tango.

15:35.636 --> 15:37.263
We didn't dance.

15:37.438 --> 15:40.373
Look, I just said that I liked you,
but in a, you know,

15:40.541 --> 15:44.705
"my girlfriend's cousin, non-kissing,
hands to yourself" kind of way.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.180
Oh, Sabrina.
Boy, am I glad to see you. Mm.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.373
Sarah.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.212
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you Sarah?

15:52.386 --> 15:54.980
Of course I am.
I just like to talk to myself aloud.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.316
You know, like, "Hi, Sarah."
"Way to go, Sarah."

15:57.491 --> 15:58.924
And "Sarah, what are you doing here

15:59.092 --> 16:00.559
watching Sabrina
kiss her boyfriend?"

16:00.727 --> 16:02.558
Answer: I don't rightly know.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.391
Well, um,
I'll just let you two catch up.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.129
Did you two switch clothes?

16:08.302 --> 16:10.532
Actually, I don't want to know.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.865
My, someone's nose
is bent out of shape.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.066
Not for long.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.701
<i>I'm not getting what I seek</i>
<i>I give you back your big old beak</i>

16:19.880 --> 16:21.313
And now you can follow your nose.

16:21.482 --> 16:25.179
I've had it with your fancy talk and
macking on my boyfriend. See you.

16:25.352 --> 16:29.948
Hmm, that's weird.
I just had my 25,000 ping service.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.516
While you ponder, I take action.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.820
Excuse me, my consort awaits.

16:35.496 --> 16:38.124
This would be so much easier
if I had any idea what she was saying.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.959
Sarah, come back here.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.430
Keep your eyes open.
I don't see Harvey anywhere.

16:42.603 --> 16:44.036
Ooh, Harvey who?

16:44.204 --> 16:45.228
Focus, Morgan.

16:45.405 --> 16:49.068
Okay, uh, you take the ladies' room,
I'll check the men's.

16:49.910 --> 16:51.969
Let me put this
as eloquently as I can.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.545
Keep your grubby mitts
off my man or else.

16:54.715 --> 16:57.206
Your mama.
I learned that from the bouncer.

16:57.384 --> 17:03.584
Normally, I'd suggest pistols at dawn,
but I think these will have to do.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.849
Are you suggesting
we play pool for Aaron's hand?

17:06.026 --> 17:07.253
Don't be ridiculous.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.721
- Oh, good.
- I'm suggesting a duel to the death.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.422
- Well, as long as it's not pool.
- <i>En garde.</i>

17:12.598 --> 17:15.500
Here, now? Well, I'm not gonna
make a big scene on Aaron's big night.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.565
Whoo, nice shot.
Too bad you didn't call it.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.913
Take that and that and that.

17:58.085 --> 18:00.747
Take this and this and this.

18:00.921 --> 18:02.616
Sabrina, I am so glad I found you.

18:02.789 --> 18:05.019
I'm afraid something drastic
is about to happen.

18:05.192 --> 18:06.386
You think?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.755
Do you want two guys
fighting over you in public?

18:08.929 --> 18:12.057
Ripping each other's shirts,
getting all sweaty?

18:12.232 --> 18:15.463
On the other hand,
boys will be boys. Heh.

18:44.889 --> 18:46.220
Why are you doing this?

18:46.390 --> 18:48.415
Because you can't rewrite a classic.

18:48.592 --> 18:51.561
No, but you can rework it. Didn't you
see Leonardo in <i>Romeo</i> + <i>Juliet?</i>

18:52.363 --> 18:55.025
Oh, I love that. He was great.

18:55.199 --> 18:56.359
He always is.

18:56.534 --> 18:59.059
- Hey, look, there he is now.
- Where?

18:59.970 --> 19:01.801
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

19:02.773 --> 19:04.741
Sabrina,
I have to talk to you about Harvey.

19:04.909 --> 19:07.104
I think Morgan and I
may have created a monster.

19:07.278 --> 19:09.143
It's better than an alter ego.
I gotta go.

19:13.684 --> 19:16.619
- So where do you think you're going?
- Straight through you, if necessary.

19:16.787 --> 19:18.049
Oh, I don't think so.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.689
You mind
if I made an announcement?

19:19.857 --> 19:22.485
Would you mind if I came to your
house and sang in your shower?

19:23.027 --> 19:26.019
No, that would be great.
So if I could just borrow the mike?

19:26.197 --> 19:27.630
SABRINA:
Had it with your fancy talk.

19:27.798 --> 19:29.425
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.726
You know you can't defeat me.

19:30.901 --> 19:33.563
So why, pray tell, are you so willing
to risk life and limb for him?

19:33.737 --> 19:35.762
Because, pray tell, I love him.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.231
Never mind.

19:40.144 --> 19:41.475
Hmm.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.613
What did you say?

19:43.781 --> 19:45.510
I said, I love you.

19:45.683 --> 19:46.911
There, I finally said it.

19:47.084 --> 19:48.574
Aaron, I love you.

19:49.653 --> 19:51.018
I love you too.

19:51.188 --> 19:53.452
- You do?
- Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, I do.

19:53.924 --> 19:57.553
Uh, excuse me, we actually have
a couple of more songs to sing here.

19:57.828 --> 19:59.900
Oh, right, sorry.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.900
Once again, Sixpence None The Richer.

20:08.999 --> 20:12.127
There, I don't know if you just heard,
but he just said he loves me.

20:12.302 --> 20:15.066
And I believe I heard you say
that you love him.

20:15.239 --> 20:16.900
Of course, I only had to
kiss your beloved

20:17.074 --> 20:19.235
and beat you with a pool cue
to get you to say it,

20:19.410 --> 20:21.435
but it's all part of being a tragic hero.

20:21.612 --> 20:24.080
Wow, I did say it.

20:24.248 --> 20:25.647
How can I ever thank you?

20:25.816 --> 20:28.546
Oh, your kind words and
boyfriend's lips are thanks enough.

20:28.719 --> 20:31.552
- Yeah, about that kiss...
- Gotta go.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.015
Sabrina.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.717
Hey, there's the man I love.
Ooh, I gotta say, I love saying that.

20:36.894 --> 20:38.384
And I don't mind hearing it.

20:38.562 --> 20:40.723
You know, we've gotta promise
to be open with each other

20:40.898 --> 20:41.922
and not hold back.

20:42.499 --> 20:44.626
Yeah, um, about that.

20:44.802 --> 20:47.464
Something happened this afternoon
with your cousin

20:47.638 --> 20:49.071
that I maybe I should tell you.

20:49.239 --> 20:51.605
And yet some things
are better left unsaid.

20:59.016 --> 21:00.278
Hey, Harvey.

21:00.451 --> 21:03.420
You know, I stopped by your house
yesterday and met your Cyrano.

21:03.587 --> 21:05.680
You did? I mean, oh, you did?

21:05.856 --> 21:09.519
So, uh, you know, what did she say?
Was there kissing involved?

21:09.693 --> 21:11.627
Funny you should mention it,
but, yeah.

21:11.795 --> 21:13.524
Plus she gave me some
really good advice.

21:13.697 --> 21:15.426
She did? What did she tell you?

21:15.599 --> 21:19.194
Oh, you'll find out.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

21:19.369 --> 21:21.098
but someday.

21:23.173 --> 21:26.006
I wonder
if she's a better kisser than I am.

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
