02:15.036 --> 02:16.285

02:16.446 --> 02:18.270

03:41.706 --> 03:43.689
You sure you don't
wanna do it professional?

03:43.750 --> 03:45.524
You... Why do you keep asking me
that?

03:45.585 --> 03:47.860
'Cause you keep singing.

03:47.921 --> 03:48.878

03:56.471 --> 03:58.279
Come on.

03:58.881 --> 04:01.282
Jack Benny, what did
I tell you about

04:01.309 --> 04:02.725
letting that dog in the house!

04:02.885 --> 04:04.227
I didn't mean to Mama.

04:04.387 --> 04:05.620
What you got there?

04:05.647 --> 04:06.879
Looked like a broke rubber ball.

04:06.940 --> 04:08.305
We was playing fetch.

04:08.399 --> 04:09.640
No, that's your
damn diaphragm.

04:09.734 --> 04:12.217
You got no business
digging in my things!

04:12.278 --> 04:13.811
You put that dog out
and you go to your room!

04:13.905 --> 04:15.630
But Ma, it's still light out!

04:15.657 --> 04:17.740
You want daddy to whoop ya?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.972
Oh, come on.
We'll have fun.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.917
I don't like lying... not
one bit.

04:28.670 --> 04:30.402
You need to find someone else.

04:30.463 --> 04:33.497
But we're not lyin'.
You're Hilda Hensley.

04:33.591 --> 04:36.241
We ain't gotta tell 'em
you're my Mama, too.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.594
But I ain't your "talent
scout", whatever that means.

04:38.754 --> 04:41.764
And that woman from the show
was pretty clear, 'no family'.

04:41.924 --> 04:44.100
Which is why we ain't tellin'.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.585
Hey, I get a hit record
outta this,

04:46.646 --> 04:48.846
I will buy you two fridges.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.441
Please.

04:52.602 --> 04:54.351
Ain't nobody I want
there with me but you.

04:54.445 --> 04:58.856
Ohhh. Fine.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.433
Thank you, mama.

05:01.494 --> 05:04.620
It's perfect. This is it.

05:04.780 --> 05:07.105
This is what I'm gonna to wear.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.683
You can't wear that.

05:08.710 --> 05:10.201
I'll have someone take you
shopping after rehearsal.

05:10.295 --> 05:11.610
Now, what are you going to sing?

05:11.671 --> 05:13.854
uh, my single,
"Poor Man's Roses."

05:13.882 --> 05:15.856
Hmm, What else
do you have?

05:15.884 --> 05:18.784
Will you even heard it?

05:18.845 --> 05:20.803
I like you, Patsy I do.

05:20.963 --> 05:22.305
And I think you can
succeed here.

05:22.465 --> 05:23.622
But if you feel
more comfortable on

05:23.683 --> 05:25.366
the hillbilly circuit,
we'll understand.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.868
Well what the hell's wrong
with being a hillbilly?

05:27.896 --> 05:29.478
Well not a thing.

05:29.639 --> 05:31.539
But every week millions of
people across this country tune

05:31.566 --> 05:34.483
their radios and televisions in
to Arthur Godfrey.

05:34.644 --> 05:37.561
You're singing for them too.

05:37.655 --> 05:39.530
Now, do you have anything else?

05:42.035 --> 05:44.218
Hmf.

05:44.245 --> 05:45.661
Hello Miss Hensley,

05:45.821 --> 05:47.163

Well, I have Miss
Patsy Cline with me

05:53.379 --> 05:54.486
Mama, can you sing
"In The Pines"...

05:54.547 --> 05:55.671
Uh-uh, Turn around,
and sit still.

05:55.831 --> 05:57.581
I want you to sing
a song 'for bed.

05:57.675 --> 05:59.750
'm not sure baby, but hush up
now because it's fixin' to start.

06:00.929 --> 06:02.178

Loretta just made her first
appearance on the Opry stage and

Julie, what's wrong?

15:59.318 --> 16:01.501
You made her red,
but I wanted her blue!

16:01.529 --> 16:03.111
Ugh, I only colored the one.

16:03.272 --> 16:04.762
There's plenty other
princesses, baby.

16:04.824 --> 16:06.949
Julie Dick, honey,
what did I tell you?

16:07.109 --> 16:09.343
Maybe you should get your
own coloring book.

16:09.370 --> 16:13.622
Mama's sorry, babe.

16:13.782 --> 16:17.017
You sure you don't
want to cut it back?

16:17.044 --> 16:20.687
I want to add country radio to
the front half of this schedule.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.280

17:24.853 --> 17:26.586

17:26.614 --> 17:30.757
Yeah well, Look I... I figure
we... we've come about as far as

17:30.784 --> 17:36.688
we can on our own, but, uh, now
we could use the guidance of

17:36.749 --> 17:39.041
experienced professionals
such as yourself.

17:39.201 --> 17:40.600
Well, we're sure honored
you came to us.

17:40.628 --> 17:41.209

17:41.370 --> 17:42.436

17:42.463 --> 17:43.545

you're serious.

17:43.705 --> 17:45.047

living in Washington?

17:51.889 --> 17:53.613
get enough together
to get a place.

17:53.641 --> 17:56.283

some work on, uh...

17:56.310 --> 17:58.894

18:09.398 --> 18:10.906
Well, you're still you.

18:11.066 --> 18:12.632
Alright? You're just... more.

18:12.660 --> 18:13.891
Mmm hmm.

18:13.953 --> 18:15.318
You know, a little sparkle
on your outfits.

18:15.412 --> 18:16.803
Are you opposed to sparkle?

18:16.830 --> 18:18.563
Well, no sir.

18:18.624 --> 18:19.748
And we're gonna get you
in some high heels,

18:19.908 --> 18:21.324
put on a little makeup.

18:21.418 --> 18:24.920
Nah, nope. Nah, nah, nah.
No.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.739
Sparkle's fine but there ain't
no way she's wearing makeup.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.484
Well, Doo, I mean... honey, you
said it yourself,

18:30.511 --> 18:31.835
I mean, they're
the professionals.

18:31.929 --> 18:33.578
Maybe we should listen to
what they have to say.

18:33.639 --> 18:35.263
You ain't paintin' your face
up to look like a prostitute.

18:35.424 --> 18:37.674
Ain't got nothin' to do with
the reason why people like you.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.176
In fact, its the opposite.

18:40.270 --> 18:42.086
And people like you 'cause you
seem like everybody else.

18:42.147 --> 18:44.014
Right.

18:44.108 --> 18:47.943
Well, she's got down home
charm, but, you know we need

18:48.103 --> 18:50.445
folks in cheap seats to be able
to see that pretty face.

18:50.605 --> 18:54.825
Well, yeah, people see
her face just fine.

18:56.829 --> 19:00.288
Well, we're certainly not
gonna force you to do anything.

19:00.449 --> 19:03.016
Well, I brought, um, my
songs like... like you asked and

19:03.043 --> 19:06.461
I... I'd really love if you
could still help me with those.

19:06.621 --> 19:08.688

Patsy, we all hope you get
better real soon.

be real sweet.

23:24.429 --> 23:25.445
Miss Lynn?

23:25.472 --> 23:27.055
Yessir?

23:27.215 --> 23:29.449

Patsy Cline's husband.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.283
She heard you and
wanted to know.

23:30.310 --> 23:31.618
Well heavens!

23:31.645 --> 23:34.396
Charlie Cline!

23:34.556 --> 23:35.730
I can't believe I'm
squeezin on ya!

23:35.890 --> 23:37.048
It's actually Dick.

23:37.109 --> 23:37.807
You need something, buddy?

23:37.901 --> 23:38.975
Baby come here.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.460
This... This is
Patsy Cline's husband.

23:40.487 --> 23:41.385
Charlie Dick.

23:41.446 --> 23:43.905
Mooney Lynn.

23:44.065 --> 23:45.799
Patsy heard you on the Jamboree
and was hoping you'd come by

23:45.826 --> 23:47.133
and visit her tomorrow?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.244
What?

23:49.404 --> 23:50.637
Hey well she'll be there.

23:50.664 --> 23:52.822
Mh-hmm.

23:52.916 --> 23:56.159
You going to
behave today?"

23:56.253 --> 23:58.586
Come on in.

23:58.747 --> 23:59.996
You got a vistor.

24:00.090 --> 24:03.333
Oh hey...
you must be Loretta.

24:03.427 --> 24:04.834
Well come on now.

24:04.928 --> 24:06.152
How we gonna visit if you
standing in the hall?

24:06.179 --> 24:08.321
Oh.

24:08.348 --> 24:09.989
Go ahead and shut the
door if you don't mind.

24:10.017 --> 24:12.675
Those for me?

24:12.769 --> 24:14.752
Um.

24:14.813 --> 24:17.439
Oh.

24:17.599 --> 24:21.684
I don't even like roses.

24:21.778 --> 24:22.777
Toss those.

24:22.937 --> 24:24.279
Put 'em in the
sink or something.

24:24.439 --> 24:26.990
Yours will look real
pretty in that vase.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.180
Miss Cline, I hope you're
not angry with me.

24:34.207 --> 24:37.350
Angry? Why? And call me Patsy.

24:37.377 --> 24:40.370
I wou... for singing your song.

24:40.464 --> 24:41.354
Not at all.

24:41.381 --> 24:42.856
I... I thought it was real sweet.

24:42.883 --> 24:45.358
I wanted to thank you for it.

24:45.385 --> 24:47.785
Doo told me I was being crazy.

24:47.846 --> 24:50.713
You think I invited you here
to yell at you or something?

24:50.807 --> 24:51.973
Well I don't know.

24:52.133 --> 24:53.791
I don't always think
before I do things.

24:53.852 --> 24:56.144
Doo says causes all
sorts of problems.

24:56.304 --> 25:00.982
Well now I gotta
know who Doo is.

25:01.142 --> 25:04.652
Oh, Doo's my husband.

25:04.813 --> 25:07.714
Well, uh... Mooney most people
call him on account of he used

25:07.741 --> 25:09.473
to deliver moonshine back where
he is from in Butcher Holler.

25:09.534 --> 25:11.401
But before that his daddy
called him Doolittle.

25:11.495 --> 25:12.827
I think because he is
such a little thing.

25:12.987 --> 25:15.479
Sure did grow though.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.481
Still, I just call him Doo.

25:17.542 --> 25:20.727
Well you sure got
folks talking, sugar.

25:20.754 --> 25:22.153
Now your with the
Wilburns I hear.

25:22.214 --> 25:23.246
Uh... well sorta.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.747
Doyle's been
working with me on

25:24.841 --> 25:27.066
songwriting but... but I'm only
here 'cause of Doo.

25:27.094 --> 25:28.343
How you figure?

25:28.503 --> 25:29.511
Well he's the one that
wanted me to sing.

25:29.671 --> 25:32.071
You don't wanna sing?

25:32.099 --> 25:32.847
No, I like it.

25:33.007 --> 25:34.590
Just it don't make no sense

25:34.684 --> 25:36.576
anybody pay to see me is all.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.354
Ain't nothing special.

25:39.514 --> 25:41.080
So you just do whatever
Doo tells you?

25:41.108 --> 25:47.420
You ain't got no drive
of your own?

25:47.447 --> 25:49.756
I was real young when we met.

25:49.783 --> 25:52.349
And he'd already served in the
army and traveled around,

25:52.411 --> 25:54.035
lived a lot of life.

25:54.195 --> 25:57.205
I was just, Loretta.

25:57.365 --> 25:59.541
Felt real special he
even noticed me.

25:59.701 --> 26:00.375
How old were you?

26:00.535 --> 26:02.118
Fourteen.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.286
Well I don't mean to sound
like I got regrets.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.271
I... I love him.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.531
He works hard.

26:07.592 --> 26:09.108
Takes good care of us.

26:09.136 --> 26:14.464
It's just, well it ain't easy,
disagreeing with him.

26:14.558 --> 26:16.950
Shit sugar, disagreein'
ain't ever easy.

26:16.977 --> 26:20.954
Doesn't mean it ain't necessary.

26:20.981 --> 26:22.397
Hey let's say Doo
never happened.

26:22.557 --> 26:24.232
What do you want?

26:24.392 --> 26:26.142
I don't know I guess,

26:26.236 --> 26:29.904
I only ever thought about
wanting to be a mama.

26:30.064 --> 26:31.388
Want my family to
be taken care of.

26:31.450 --> 26:33.724
And I want everyone to know
how much I love 'em.

26:33.785 --> 26:36.652
Alright well lets think
about this a little more.

26:36.746 --> 26:39.489
Let's say all thats guaranteed.

26:39.583 --> 26:41.565
You ain't got to worry
about nothing no more.

26:41.626 --> 26:43.476
What do <i>you</i> want?

26:43.503 --> 26:48.089
I guess I want the same
thing for the world.

26:48.249 --> 26:53.410
There's so much
heartache out there.

26:53.472 --> 26:54.262
I start to think about it,

26:54.422 --> 26:56.489
I just want to die.

26:56.516 --> 26:58.749
I guess I just want everyone
to know their loved.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.935
Someone cares about them.

27:01.095 --> 27:03.754
I just don't want no one feeling
alone when they go to sleep at

27:03.815 --> 27:05.940
night even if they are.

27:06.100 --> 27:11.095
Sounds like you was always
gonna be a singer.

27:11.156 --> 27:13.114
The Wilburns offered me a
management contract.

27:13.274 --> 27:14.449
Well hey that's great!

27:14.609 --> 27:16.692
Well it could be.

27:16.786 --> 27:18.344
Well listen if you're
worried about the fact

27:18.371 --> 27:20.847
that they're musicians too,
sure, there's plenty of stone

27:20.874 --> 27:22.849
cold dumdums in this business.

27:22.876 --> 27:26.628
But I tell you my Randy's a
picker and hiring him is the

27:26.788 --> 27:28.946
best business decision
I ever made.

27:31.176 --> 27:33.192
Oh lord, it's late.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.694
You alright, little gal?

27:34.721 --> 27:37.363
Sure, just, Doo's gonna be
looking for his supper.

27:37.390 --> 27:41.309
Well alright now, give the
Cline a shove inside.

27:41.469 --> 27:42.310
Alright, ready?

27:42.470 --> 27:43.311
MmmHmm

27:43.471 --> 27:44.704
Alright here we go.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.774
Oh, hey now.

27:48.693 --> 27:51.060
What are you looking for?

27:51.154 --> 27:53.947
Dinner, damnit!

27:57.485 --> 27:59.160
You been at the hospital
this whole time?

27:59.320 --> 28:01.721
Patsy's real sweet.

28:01.748 --> 28:06.242
Thank I finally got
a friend here.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.744
Did Charlie give
you a ride home?

28:08.838 --> 28:11.655
She gave me money for a taxi.

28:11.716 --> 28:12.507
I don't like that.

28:12.667 --> 28:13.991
You taking a taxi by yourself.

28:14.052 --> 28:15.401
Well it seems like there's
a lot you don't like.

28:15.428 --> 28:16.419
Oh yeah?

28:16.513 --> 28:18.680
You looked at
that contract yet?

28:18.840 --> 28:20.089
From the Wilburns?

28:20.183 --> 28:22.241
Sure.

28:22.269 --> 28:24.577
Well? I wanna sign it.

28:24.604 --> 28:25.595
Not yet.

28:25.689 --> 28:27.021
Why?

28:27.181 --> 28:30.858
Loretta, you got a
fifth grade education,

28:31.019 --> 28:35.113
what the hell you know
about contracts?

28:42.289 --> 28:43.946
I'm frying liver tonight.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.856
Won't take long.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.875
See that it don't.

29:37.177 --> 29:38.985
Looks real fair to me.

29:39.012 --> 29:40.987
I'd ask 'em to make it two
years, instead of three.

29:41.014 --> 29:43.080
But if I was you
I would sign it.

29:43.141 --> 29:44.490
Can I tell Doo that?

29:44.517 --> 29:45.933
Well honey he's your husband.

29:46.094 --> 29:47.084
You can tell him
whatever you want.

29:48.647 --> 29:50.254
Afternoon Miss Patsy.

29:50.315 --> 29:51.588
Hey there Gertie,
you met Loretta?

29:51.650 --> 29:53.590
I have.

29:53.652 --> 29:55.351
I heard you on the Opry last
week, you were great!

29:55.445 --> 29:56.927
Well thank you.

29:56.988 --> 29:58.446
Now what form of torture you
bringing me today, girl?

29:58.606 --> 30:01.616
Ohh Miss Pasty.

30:01.776 --> 30:04.193
You make sure she eats
this, Miss Loretta.

30:04.287 --> 30:05.695
I promise.

30:05.789 --> 30:06.954
I'm going to grab you
some ice water.

30:07.115 --> 30:08.956
MmmHmm

30:09.117 --> 30:11.184
Dump that in the commode.

30:11.211 --> 30:12.126
Patsy, that's good food!

30:12.286 --> 30:14.020
Then you eat it.

30:14.047 --> 30:15.538
Charlie was supposed to smuggle
me a cheeseburger but

30:15.632 --> 30:16.706
Julie got sick.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.691
Now come on, grab my wheelchair.

30:18.718 --> 30:19.616
You...

30:22.639 --> 30:24.030
Well, I ain't got a car
and you can't drive

30:24.057 --> 30:24.972
so what are we doing?

30:25.133 --> 30:27.049
Rotiers is down
the street relax.

30:27.143 --> 30:28.309
Miss Patsy, you sure
wolfed that food fast.

30:28.469 --> 30:29.885
Oh I couldn't help myself.

30:29.979 --> 30:32.371
Courtyard's only open
another twenty minutes.

30:32.399 --> 30:34.540
See you soon.

30:34.976 --> 30:36.392
Lord have mercy this is good.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.711
See it's going to be
downhill the whole way back.

30:38.738 --> 30:41.380
How long you been with Charlie?

30:41.408 --> 30:43.140
Well that depends on when
you start countin'.

30:43.201 --> 30:45.476
Been married a little
over two years.

30:45.537 --> 30:47.311
Of course I had to
divorce Gerald first.

30:47.372 --> 30:48.663
And your babies?

30:48.823 --> 30:50.556
Charlie's.
Gerald didn't want any.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.558
Didn't want me singing neither.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.060
That don't make no sense.

30:54.087 --> 30:57.246
No, it did not.

30:57.340 --> 30:59.323
Hey, how'd you even
start singing anyway?

30:59.384 --> 31:02.068
Singing long before Gerald.

31:02.095 --> 31:03.511
Fourteen I started.

31:03.671 --> 31:04.904
Your mama and daddy
singers or something?

31:04.931 --> 31:06.681
My daddy had a real fine voice.

31:06.841 --> 31:08.908
Still does for all I know.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.001
Didn't do it
professional though.

31:11.062 --> 31:14.247
I guess I got him to thank
for the reason I started.

31:14.274 --> 31:15.748
Him running off.

31:15.775 --> 31:17.600
Had to help mama pay
the bills some kinda way.

31:17.694 --> 31:18.100
Here you go.

31:18.194 --> 31:18.860
Thank you.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.194
Welcome.

31:20.354 --> 31:21.771
Hey.

31:21.865 --> 31:26.016
I went straight from daddy's
house right to Doo's.

31:26.077 --> 31:27.851
I don't know what I would have
done without him there to talk

31:27.912 --> 31:29.203
to people for me.

31:29.363 --> 31:31.097
I never had any
problems talking.

31:31.124 --> 31:34.600
Course everybody around town
figured was handing out hum jobs

31:34.627 --> 31:36.527
like business cards.

31:36.588 --> 31:38.045
Hum jobs?

31:38.206 --> 31:41.290
Yeah it's when you
use your mouth.

31:41.384 --> 31:46.279
Down there.

31:46.306 --> 31:47.388
There's a name for that?

31:47.548 --> 31:49.540
Of course. They've
got a lot of 'em.

31:49.601 --> 31:52.560
Lets see there's
header, tongue party,

31:52.720 --> 31:56.046
french tricks, lip service.

31:56.107 --> 32:03.462
Pricknic, lunch box,
gum job, goop gobbler.

32:03.490 --> 32:04.721
You... you're making these up.

32:04.783 --> 32:07.224
Gobbledegoop, kowtow cow.

32:07.285 --> 32:08.301
Woo!

32:08.328 --> 32:09.560
Thanks Miss Pasty.

32:09.621 --> 32:12.805
Knob bobbin'. Ham sandwich.
Man eatin'.

32:12.832 --> 32:14.290
Patsy!

32:16.085 --> 32:17.919
Hello.

32:18.079 --> 32:19.145
Hello.

32:19.172 --> 32:23.499
803 Maple Street please.

32:23.593 --> 32:26.410
Uh, wait can we make a
different stop first?

32:26.471 --> 32:31.006
Alright. Wash up,
babies, food's here!

32:32.093 --> 32:33.768
I called Patsy's room and
Charlie said you left hours ago!

32:33.928 --> 32:35.511
These kids are near starvin!

32:35.605 --> 32:37.087
Well you're gonna have
to learn to throw

32:37.148 --> 32:38.331
something together if I'm
gonna be out on the road.

32:38.358 --> 32:41.016
Where the hell you been?

32:41.110 --> 32:42.276
I stopped by the Wilburns
on the way home.

32:42.436 --> 32:44.094
To drop off the contract.

32:44.155 --> 32:47.006
You did what?

32:47.033 --> 32:48.174
Their mama's real sweet.

32:48.201 --> 32:49.283
She put plates together.

32:49.443 --> 32:50.509
Pork chops.
They're a little cold, but...

32:50.537 --> 32:52.203
- What do you...
- Doo!

32:57.544 --> 32:59.201
We talked about this.

32:59.295 --> 33:00.795
I gave it to Patsy to look at.

33:00.955 --> 33:02.779
She said she thought
it was real fair.

33:02.841 --> 33:04.690
What good goddamned thing
does Patsy have to do

33:04.717 --> 33:06.116
with any of this?

33:06.177 --> 33:07.784
You said it'd be a good
idea to get an opinion

33:07.846 --> 33:08.694
from a professional.

33:08.721 --> 33:09.862
She's a professional.

33:09.889 --> 33:10.713
No I didn't say nothin'
to anything...

33:10.807 --> 33:11.530
- Yes you did.
- No I did not!

33:11.558 --> 33:12.531
Sure you did!

33:12.559 --> 33:14.367
Yes last night right before bed.

33:14.394 --> 33:17.144
Don't you remember?

33:23.361 --> 33:25.378
I ain't never lied
to Doo before.

33:25.405 --> 33:26.303
Never.

33:26.364 --> 33:27.488
There. Hold still.

33:27.648 --> 33:32.309
Am I going to hell?

33:32.370 --> 33:33.903
For lyin' to your husband?

33:33.997 --> 33:36.706
Every last girl I know
will see you there.

33:37.250 --> 33:38.332
He's so mad.

33:38.492 --> 33:39.500
He was supposed to
drive me to this gig

33:39.660 --> 33:40.668
I got in Knoxville
tomorrow night and

33:40.828 --> 33:43.729
he flat told me to
take the bus alone.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.080
Want one of the
Wilburns take you?

33:45.174 --> 33:47.341
No they're already
on the road.

33:47.501 --> 33:49.919
I ain't never taken a bus alone.

33:50.013 --> 33:53.556
I ain't ever even
played a show alone.

33:55.268 --> 33:58.835
That don't even look like
I'm wearing make-up at all.

33:58.897 --> 34:00.596
Now listen I ain't
gonna make a habit out

34:00.690 --> 34:03.249
of this cause holy hell
sister, you better learn

34:03.276 --> 34:05.359
to swim, you're gonna be
messin' with all them sharks

34:05.519 --> 34:10.347
but I wouldn't mind a
trip to Knoxville.

34:10.408 --> 34:11.514
Patsy, really?

34:11.576 --> 34:12.849
Mmm-hmm.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.690
Dressing room's this way.

34:19.751 --> 34:24.378
We don't get too many singers, so
you'll just have to make do.

34:24.538 --> 34:29.199
We're gonna be needin'
half up front.

34:29.260 --> 34:30.626
What's that?

34:30.719 --> 34:32.962
Her fee. Half of it before
she steps on stage.

34:33.056 --> 34:34.947
Wilburn said something
about a Mooney.

34:34.974 --> 34:36.782
You Mooney?

34:36.809 --> 34:40.561
I'm Patsy.

34:44.558 --> 34:45.958
You got the money or not?

34:45.985 --> 34:46.717
Patsy, its alright.

34:46.777 --> 34:48.460
Well, Lamar?

34:48.487 --> 34:49.719

34:49.781 --> 34:51.797

34:51.824 --> 34:55.467

34:55.495 --> 34:58.162

35:02.585 --> 35:06.312

everybody hates it.

35:06.339 --> 35:08.923
Yes, when I get
some money saved up

35:09.083 --> 35:11.484
I'm gonna get one made.
That sparkles.

35:11.511 --> 35:15.488
But for now this is as
good as it gets, ok?

35:15.515 --> 35:17.598
Well, ok then.

35:20.436 --> 35:22.085

35:22.146 --> 35:24.105

35:24.265 --> 35:25.998
Up and down the halls
of that dang office.

35:26.025 --> 35:29.092

35:29.153 --> 35:31.320
Oh, she's good. Go on.

35:33.157 --> 35:34.931
Don't move.

35:34.993 --> 35:36.342
What do you mean?

35:36.369 --> 35:37.785
When he calls your name
just stay right there.

35:37.945 --> 35:39.695
Oh Patsy, you're gonna
get me in trouble!

35:39.789 --> 35:42.773
No honey, I'm gonna
get you paid.

35:42.834 --> 35:45.776

36:07.650 --> 36:08.557
Oh, make it the full fee then.

36:08.651 --> 36:09.725
Listen, lady...

36:09.819 --> 36:11.134
Alright, Loretta,

36:11.195 --> 36:11.635
I'm gonna go tell 'em
that the show's cancelled.

36:11.696 --> 36:12.394
Wait, wait.

36:12.488 --> 36:13.729
Oh, you wanna tell 'em?

36:13.823 --> 36:15.322
I'll have the money to
pay you after the show.

36:15.483 --> 36:17.307
Great. I'll go keep 'em company
and you can go find it now.

36:24.042 --> 36:26.167
Is that Patsy Cline?

36:26.327 --> 36:29.152
Well, hello there. For those
of you that don't know me

36:29.213 --> 36:30.913
I'm Patsy Cline.

36:31.007 --> 36:34.842
Oh, God.

36:35.002 --> 36:36.251
Now, my good friend
Loretta Lynn is excited

36:36.345 --> 36:38.161
to sing for y'all tonight, but...

36:38.222 --> 36:40.422
Sing I Fall to Pieces!

36:40.516 --> 36:42.349
Oh, I sure would
love to, but, uh...

36:42.510 --> 36:44.685
I don't know if you heard but
I've been a little banged up.

36:44.845 --> 36:47.096
Its hard to get wind
enough to sing when

36:47.190 --> 36:49.582
a bunch of your ribs is broke.

36:52.195 --> 36:53.085
Well, what you laughin' at?

36:53.112 --> 36:56.363
You wouldn't there.

36:56.524 --> 36:57.681
Get your ass out there.

36:57.742 --> 36:59.516
Ladies and gentlemen...
Miss Loretta Lynn.

37:01.788 --> 37:03.996
Thank you.

37:11.422 --> 37:14.882
Well, lets hope I sing a
little better than I walk.

37:16.260 --> 37:17.610
Now, what are you doin'...
skatin' or walkin'?

37:17.637 --> 37:18.777
Well, I'm...

37:18.805 --> 37:19.612
Pick up your feet, girl.

37:19.639 --> 37:20.462
Well, if I pick up...

37:20.556 --> 37:22.114
There you go.

37:22.141 --> 37:23.206
Oh, those arms
look real natural.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.302
Alright, now can you swing
your hips a little?

37:30.274 --> 37:31.381
What?

37:31.442 --> 37:33.067
I don't know how
to say this, sister.

37:33.227 --> 37:34.902
Ugh! Oh lord, just say it.

37:35.062 --> 37:36.812
How did you catch Mooney?

37:36.906 --> 37:37.963
What?

37:37.990 --> 37:39.298
How did you get his attention?

37:39.325 --> 37:40.466
Cause it sure wasn't by walkin'.

37:40.493 --> 37:45.487
Uh... pie.

37:45.581 --> 37:46.580
Pie?

37:46.740 --> 37:49.141
Mmm-hmm.

37:49.168 --> 37:51.493
He tried my pie at the
school social and then he...

37:51.587 --> 37:53.495
he wanted to meet
me after and he tried

37:53.589 --> 37:56.482
to drive me home in his Jeep.

37:56.509 --> 37:57.833
But I had never been
in a car before,

37:57.927 --> 38:02.004
so I made him walk with me.

38:02.923 --> 38:04.247
Can I ask you
something personal?

38:04.308 --> 38:05.491
Of course.

38:05.518 --> 38:08.585
Real personal.

38:08.646 --> 38:12.273
Got nothin' to hide.

38:18.990 --> 38:26.620
Do you... do you like
makin' love with Charlie?

38:26.780 --> 38:31.366
Of course I do. Yeah.
Most of the time.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.035
Doo gets so soaked in beer
some nights, he just...

38:33.129 --> 38:36.297
If he's not too
drunk to pass out,

38:36.457 --> 38:42.544
he's just drunk enough to
get on top of me and... sweat.

38:42.638 --> 38:47.141
It ain't no fun.

38:47.301 --> 38:50.202
Charlie ever get like that?

38:50.229 --> 38:55.316
Charlie gets drunk, but we
do alright in the sack.

38:55.476 --> 38:57.710
Truth be told, he
hadn't been drinkin'

38:57.737 --> 39:00.379
much since the accident.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.156
It's been nice.

39:02.316 --> 39:03.549
Listen Loretta,

39:03.576 --> 39:09.054
You tell him no.

39:09.081 --> 39:11.982
And if Doo doesn't want to
listen, you find something heavy

39:12.043 --> 39:15.878
and you make him.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.230
Hello?

39:18.257 --> 39:20.007
Oh, in here Mama!

39:20.167 --> 39:21.083

39:22.670 --> 39:24.086

a new outfit for the Opry.

39:25.932 --> 39:31.167

39:31.229 --> 39:36.248

40:11.644 --> 40:13.043

40:13.104 --> 40:14.210
No, he's over at Tootsie's.

40:14.272 --> 40:15.562
She better get here soon.

40:15.723 --> 40:17.790

40:17.817 --> 40:21.527

43:40.761 --> 43:42.085
We're drinking this.

43:42.146 --> 43:43.495
Well, look at this.

43:43.522 --> 43:44.679
Oh my goodness.

43:44.773 --> 43:46.832

43:46.859 --> 43:50.185
Not sure how it can't be,

43:50.279 --> 43:52.095
Patsy's downstairs with
the rest of the girls.

43:52.156 --> 43:53.672
Head on down Loretta.

43:53.699 --> 43:54.948

44:43.582 --> 44:44.981
How do you get away?

44:45.042 --> 44:47.668
Every time I turn
around he's just there.

44:47.828 --> 44:48.818
Hands where I can't see 'em.

44:48.879 --> 44:51.338
I missed you, Dottie.

44:51.498 --> 44:53.415
How long's it been since we all
been home at the same time?

44:53.509 --> 44:54.399
Year?

44:54.426 --> 44:55.917
Two?

44:56.011 --> 44:57.252
We've been doing three hundred
days a year so long,

44:57.346 --> 44:59.495
I'm not sure the point of
having a home anymore.

44:59.557 --> 45:00.906
Gosh, three hundred?

45:00.933 --> 45:02.074
That's if you're lucky.

45:02.101 --> 45:03.408
And everybody wants you.

45:03.435 --> 45:05.519
Patsy is never gone see
this dream home again.

45:05.679 --> 45:10.340
Now you show Mooney your
playroom, babe?

45:10.401 --> 45:14.086
Hey Mr. Cline, fill me up.

45:14.113 --> 45:15.529
Your leg ain't broke no more.

45:15.689 --> 45:18.273
Make your own drink.

45:18.367 --> 45:21.368
Come on man.

45:21.528 --> 45:24.020
Just got a little
chilly in here.

45:24.081 --> 45:25.430
One down, two to go.

45:25.457 --> 45:28.709
Whatta ya mean?

45:28.869 --> 45:33.046
The dream house.
The silver Cadillac.

45:33.206 --> 45:35.698
And a fox fur coat.

45:35.759 --> 45:40.304
Once I get all three, that's
when I know I've arrived.

45:41.548 --> 45:43.557
I'd be happy enough
with the house.

45:43.717 --> 45:45.467
What's yours look like?

45:45.561 --> 45:51.047
Oh, I don't know,
plenty of bedrooms and

45:51.108 --> 46:00.649
enough for all the kids, plus me
to have my own for writing.

46:00.743 --> 46:05.621
And another one for
Doo to pass out in.

46:06.999 --> 46:10.917
Tell me something, you
ever step out on him?

46:11.078 --> 46:16.648
Heck no. Never.

46:16.675 --> 46:18.574
Why'd you think that?

46:18.636 --> 46:19.575
Somebody talkin'?

46:20.921 --> 46:24.506
No, just some of them
songs of yours.

46:24.600 --> 46:28.994
No, that's just me guessing.

46:29.021 --> 46:31.513
Imagining what it
might be like to

46:31.607 --> 46:36.777
to be the sorta person
that does that kind of thing.

46:36.937 --> 46:38.428
It's maybe why I don't.

46:38.489 --> 46:41.073
Hmm.

46:43.327 --> 46:45.952
Things good with Charlie?

46:46.113 --> 46:48.455
Sure.

46:50.501 --> 46:53.293
You know you can
tell me things, right?

46:53.453 --> 46:55.278
What do you mean?

46:55.339 --> 46:58.614
I just feel like I'm
always telling you all

46:58.676 --> 47:01.968
my problems with Doo
and you never...

47:02.129 --> 47:06.047
I don't know I just...

47:06.141 --> 47:09.050
I just don't want you thinkin'
you can't tell me things.

47:09.144 --> 47:13.038
Just a lot of stuff
with the house.

47:13.065 --> 47:16.057
And I had Carnegie Hall and
those west coast dates.

47:16.151 --> 47:23.048
And you know I like everything just how I
like it so everything took twice as long.

47:23.075 --> 47:25.217
Hey when do you head
out with the Wilburns?

47:25.244 --> 47:26.642
Wednesday.

47:26.704 --> 47:28.720
For six weeks.

47:28.747 --> 47:32.907
On our very own bus.

47:33.001 --> 47:36.728
Your gonna want one of
them lavender sachets.

47:36.755 --> 47:38.413
What for?

47:38.507 --> 47:40.990
Matter of fact, I think
I got one inside.

47:41.051 --> 47:41.916
What?

47:50.510 --> 47:53.603
Why don't I just look
for it tomorrow.

47:58.944 --> 48:01.194
What am I gonna
do with out you?

48:01.354 --> 48:04.105
Who said anything about
doing without, little girl?

48:04.199 --> 48:08.426
It's going to be me and
you together forever.

48:08.454 --> 48:10.945
Three hundred dates a year.

48:11.039 --> 48:14.266
You're the one with
the imagination.

48:14.293 --> 48:17.452
Hey you need to get
something off your chest,

48:17.546 --> 48:19.271
you just picture me
sitting right next to you.

48:19.298 --> 48:25.093
I'll be there.

48:29.549 --> 48:32.041
They fired our banjo
player, this guy Teddy Dubs.

48:32.102 --> 48:34.135
He gets back to Nashville
and has the nerve

48:34.229 --> 48:37.046
to fix his mouth to say
he's sleeping with me.

48:37.107 --> 48:40.400
Course word gets back to
Doo who lost his damn mind.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.570
That man drove straight through the
night, clear down to Tuscaloosa.

48:43.730 --> 48:46.481
Wanting to drag my butt all
the way back to Nashville.

48:46.575 --> 48:49.225
I tried tellin' him that
idiot picker was lyin'.

48:49.286 --> 48:52.304
That this was my job now and
he had no right interferin'.

48:52.331 --> 48:53.563
But he wouldn't listen.

48:53.624 --> 48:54.973
I didn't mean to hurt him,

48:55.000 --> 48:56.808
just knock some sense
into him, like you said.

48:56.835 --> 49:00.328
But I guess that phone was
heavier than it seemed 'cause

49:00.422 --> 49:02.756
I knocked his two
front teeth out.

49:02.916 --> 49:04.833
He's fine, and I
got enough money

49:04.927 --> 49:06.835
saved for a couple of fake ones.

49:06.929 --> 49:09.654
Course that means I'm stuck with
those ugly drapes a while longer.

49:09.681 --> 49:15.160
Anyway I sure do miss you.

49:15.187 --> 49:17.229
Love Loretta.

49:22.486 --> 49:23.944
Mommy's home!

49:24.104 --> 49:25.779
Oh I missed y'all
something fierce.

49:25.939 --> 49:28.189
Cissy! You must have
grown two inches!

49:28.283 --> 49:29.599
I can almost reach the
pedals on the truck!

49:29.660 --> 49:31.267
Well look out world.

49:31.328 --> 49:32.861
Mama, there's a new Elvis
picture this weekend, can we go?

49:32.955 --> 49:34.454
Well sure honey, that
sounds like fun.

49:34.614 --> 49:36.030
Oh boys you been good?

49:36.124 --> 49:37.031
Yes Mama.

49:37.125 --> 49:37.773
Welcome home baby.

49:37.835 --> 49:39.292
Hey honey.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.035
Well hey Charlie!

49:41.129 --> 49:43.964
Is that Pasty's new car?
She here?

49:44.124 --> 49:46.132
It's a new car all right, but
she ain't back till next week.

49:46.293 --> 49:47.467
I wanna check the traps.

49:47.627 --> 49:49.361
Now? Honey I've been
gone for two months.

49:49.388 --> 49:51.029
And we waited for you.

49:51.056 --> 49:52.547
We'll only be a couple hours,
don't you want to unpack?

49:52.641 --> 49:54.048
Why would I wanna unpack for,

49:54.142 --> 49:55.550
I'm leavin'
again next week.

49:55.644 --> 49:56.885
Go in and lay down and relax
you must be exhausted.

49:56.979 --> 50:01.723
You're not even going
to take my bags inside?

50:01.817 --> 50:03.817
Tell your mama
you love her kids.

50:03.977 --> 50:05.485
Love you mama!

50:05.645 --> 50:08.304
Welcome home, gal!

50:08.365 --> 50:10.657
Patsy! You are back!

50:10.817 --> 50:12.717
Surprise!

50:12.744 --> 50:13.718
Where'd those come from?

50:13.745 --> 50:15.387
You like 'em?

50:15.414 --> 50:17.831
What did I do to deserve you?

50:17.991 --> 50:20.166
Oh, somethin' pretty
good I reckon.

50:26.383 --> 50:27.899
Well babies I gotta
thank you for getting

50:27.926 --> 50:28.842
us such a delicious dinner.

50:29.002 --> 50:29.825
It was my trap that caught em.

50:29.887 --> 50:31.177
Mine too!

50:33.891 --> 50:36.408
Either way, that was some
good cooking, ladies.

50:36.435 --> 50:37.425
Looks good on ya too.

50:37.519 --> 50:40.578
Well damn.

50:40.606 --> 50:43.172
Can we go outside now
it's gonna be dark?

50:43.233 --> 50:46.251
Clean plates?

50:46.278 --> 50:48.177
Alright go on then.

50:48.238 --> 50:49.362
Jars are on the porch
where you left them

50:49.522 --> 50:50.422
if you want to catch
lightnin' bugs later.

50:50.449 --> 50:54.350
Thank you, sugar.

50:54.411 --> 50:55.851
Hey you want another one?

50:55.913 --> 50:57.037
Nah, I'm good.

50:57.197 --> 51:03.785
Alright.

51:03.879 --> 51:04.786
Now that the kids
are out of earshot,

51:04.880 --> 51:05.954
you gonna tell her or what?

51:06.048 --> 51:07.121
Tell me what?

51:07.215 --> 51:08.864
Well we haven't
told Julie yet so,

51:08.926 --> 51:10.884
don't say anything
to the kids but...

51:11.044 --> 51:11.943
You're having a baby?

51:11.970 --> 51:15.037
Oh god no. Could you imagine.

51:15.098 --> 51:16.372
Well heavens, you sick?

51:16.433 --> 51:18.116
Oh jeepers Loretta,
I booked Vegas!

51:18.143 --> 51:20.452
You booked? Oh Patsy!

51:20.479 --> 51:22.228
What the hell, Loretta?

51:22.389 --> 51:24.547
Honey, Patsy is playing Vegas!

51:24.608 --> 51:25.881
Congratulations.

51:25.943 --> 51:27.550
Aww thank you Mooney.

51:27.611 --> 51:31.479
Now it is more money than I ever
heard of, let alone seen.

51:31.573 --> 51:32.964
Loretta...

51:32.991 --> 51:34.649
The fox fur?

51:34.743 --> 51:36.134
Three outta three.

51:36.161 --> 51:39.821
Patsy I'm so happy for you.

51:39.915 --> 51:41.081
Then what are you crying for?

51:41.241 --> 51:43.641
Because this is
my best friend here

51:43.669 --> 51:45.401
and her dreams just came true.

51:45.462 --> 51:48.162
And if I wanna cry about it
than dadgumit, I'm gonna cry.

51:48.256 --> 51:51.240
Now now when do you live?
How long you staying?

51:51.301 --> 51:53.318
What are you going to wear?

51:53.345 --> 51:55.987
Well mama's working on a floor
length black sequin number.

51:56.014 --> 51:57.322
It's real elegant.

51:57.349 --> 51:58.914
The run's six weeks.

51:58.976 --> 52:00.008
Seven days a week,
if you can believe it?

52:00.102 --> 52:03.753
With all the driving
and the holidays

52:03.814 --> 52:06.164
we'll be gone two
months and change.

52:06.191 --> 52:07.332
I'm going to bring the
kids out for Christmas.

52:07.359 --> 52:08.349
Palm trees and sand.

52:08.443 --> 52:11.185
Ho ho ho.

52:11.279 --> 52:15.006
So you'll be gone
before I get back?

52:15.033 --> 52:18.076
See you next year!

52:21.448 --> 52:26.292
Well that's still just about
the best news I ever heard.

52:26.453 --> 52:28.520
Hey I heard the Wilburns
hired Harold Morrison

52:28.547 --> 52:31.022
to play banjo for you.

52:31.049 --> 52:33.207
You're gonna like him.

52:33.301 --> 52:35.468
What the hell does that mean?

52:35.628 --> 52:38.530
Oh that he plays good
and bathes regular.

52:38.557 --> 52:40.956
You think I'm jokin'?

52:41.018 --> 52:43.292
Doo.

52:43.353 --> 52:45.537
She thinks I'm a joke.

52:45.564 --> 52:46.962
Relax Mooney.

52:47.024 --> 52:49.207
Damnit Doo! What the hell
is the matter with you!

52:49.234 --> 52:51.300
- I ain't stupid Loretta!
- Oh no you're not. You're drunk!

52:51.361 --> 52:52.652
You're out there every night,
all that mess on your face!

52:52.812 --> 52:54.045
You think I don't know
what their lookin' at!

52:54.072 --> 52:55.229
You think I don't know!

52:55.323 --> 52:56.564
You think I don't know
what their thinkin'!

52:56.658 --> 52:58.641
You don't get to be
mad at me when you

52:58.702 --> 52:59.975
wanted this more than I did!

53:01.246 --> 53:02.144
Jesus, Mooney!

53:02.205 --> 53:03.221
Hey!

53:03.248 --> 53:04.889
No no no wait!

53:04.916 --> 53:06.148
You go ahead and try
it little girl, go ahead!

53:06.209 --> 53:07.149
I look like a little girl?

53:07.210 --> 53:08.651
In a damn bonnet!

53:08.712 --> 53:10.078
Let's get you outta here.

53:10.172 --> 53:11.654
Your going to lose more
than your teeth this time!

53:11.715 --> 53:14.883
Let me be!

53:30.776 --> 53:33.101
Heard Charlie found the
perfect song for you,

53:33.195 --> 53:35.695
and you won't even listen to it.

53:35.855 --> 53:37.605
We're talkin' about Charlie now?

53:37.699 --> 53:42.577
We sure are. I'm sick of
talkin. It's your turn.

53:49.795 --> 53:51.694
He came home the other
night and had been drinking

53:51.755 --> 53:53.938
with that new kid
in town songwriter.

53:53.965 --> 53:59.961
Hugh something.
Nelson... anyway.

54:00.055 --> 54:04.039
Came home with a new song of
his at three in the morning.

54:04.101 --> 54:06.284
Mind you.

54:06.311 --> 54:12.123
And started playing it over
and over and over, top volume.

54:12.150 --> 54:13.399
Hey babe I've got the
perfect song for you.

54:13.560 --> 54:18.053
Woke up the kids.

54:18.115 --> 54:20.323
I swear, sometimes its
like I got three babies.

54:23.787 --> 54:28.806
Still. Be a shame to
lose a perfect song just

54:28.834 --> 54:32.544
'cause your husband's an ass.

54:38.093 --> 54:41.335

55:31.897 --> 55:35.631

55:35.692 --> 55:38.209
Hey, you wanna hear what I'm
thinkin' for my entrance?

55:38.236 --> 55:40.153
In Vegas? Shoot, yeah.

55:40.313 --> 55:42.380
Alright so I asked for a
baby grand piano do this

55:42.407 --> 55:44.306
real classy arrangement of
"Come on In", you heard it?

55:44.367 --> 55:45.641
Mmm-hmm

55:45.702 --> 55:49.070
So the theatre is dark.
You picturing it?

55:49.164 --> 55:50.571
Yes.

55:50.665 --> 55:53.057
Alright and the spotlight
is searching the room

55:53.084 --> 55:56.561
and then bam there I am in the
back of the theatre.

55:56.588 --> 56:00.414
And I'm walking down the
aisle shaking hands as I go.

56:00.508 --> 56:02.233
Hey there sir.

56:02.260 --> 56:04.068
You know its real
classy for Vegas,

56:04.095 --> 56:06.904
with a little hillbilly
hospitality for the Cline.

56:06.932 --> 56:08.740
I love it.

56:08.767 --> 56:11.409
Hey why don't you come with me
to Little Rock this weekend?

56:11.436 --> 56:12.910
Yeah you could open for me.

56:12.938 --> 56:13.911
I'll split the fee with you.

56:13.939 --> 56:16.522
I couldn't take half your money.

56:16.683 --> 56:17.857
Oh sure you could.

56:18.017 --> 56:20.026
I got a suite at the
nicest hotel in town.

56:20.186 --> 56:22.086
And they've got a
breakfast buffet with an

56:22.113 --> 56:26.699
ice sculpture you can't believe.

56:26.859 --> 56:30.019
No I t... I told Betty Sue I'd
take her to that new Elvis picture.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.371
Take her when we get back.

56:31.531 --> 56:32.688
She'll understand.

56:32.749 --> 56:34.189
She might.

56:34.251 --> 56:36.267
I don't like going back
on things with the kids.

56:36.294 --> 56:40.529
And I do?

56:40.590 --> 56:44.108
I didn't say that.

56:44.135 --> 56:46.944
You got it all figured out, huh?

56:46.972 --> 56:49.889
I got what figured out? Now,
what are you talkin' about?

56:50.049 --> 56:53.117
Nothing. I'm going to
get up to dinner.

56:53.144 --> 56:56.187
Why don't I call you a cab.

57:03.071 --> 57:05.071

I wish I could ♪

Lord who the hell's

57:53.946 --> 57:56.514
It's me.

57:56.541 --> 57:59.016
What? What's wrong?
What's the matter? You ok?

57:59.044 --> 58:02.520
I'm fine. How are you?

58:02.547 --> 58:04.446
It's four in the morning.

58:04.507 --> 58:06.382
I know.

58:09.220 --> 58:11.012
No post office in Vegas?

58:16.302 --> 58:19.294
I'm sorry for not writing.

58:19.356 --> 58:23.316
I just... I was
worried about you.

58:23.476 --> 58:26.569
Oh, gal, you don't gotta worry.

58:28.365 --> 58:36.237
I just... I was just... I don't
know. Embarrassed I guess.

58:36.331 --> 58:39.240
Well what for?

58:40.001 --> 58:44.078
The place is a dump.

58:44.172 --> 58:46.914
Well come on now,
can't be that bad.

58:47.008 --> 58:48.733
Only difference between Vegas

58:48.760 --> 58:52.420
and the dumps I came up
in is the size of my paycheck.

58:52.514 --> 58:55.406
Ain't that enough?

58:55.433 --> 58:59.143
Listen to me, what a jackass.

59:05.777 --> 59:09.420
I'm fine. I'm great. I just...

59:09.447 --> 59:12.848
If I gotta be away for so long.

59:12.909 --> 59:17.912
Be nice to be comfortable.

59:19.082 --> 59:21.933
Oh, but, huh, hey get
a load of this.

59:21.960 --> 59:24.377
Randy bought a plane.

59:24.537 --> 59:26.712
What do you mean, like a toy?

59:26.873 --> 59:29.364
No, a real one,
for flying to gigs.

59:29.426 --> 59:31.275
Who?

59:31.302 --> 59:32.777
Him and me.

59:32.804 --> 59:34.369
He got his license a while back.

59:34.431 --> 59:36.371
It will be great.

59:36.433 --> 59:40.801
And I can spend so much
more time with the kids.

59:40.895 --> 59:42.711
For one offs I can fly
out the same day and

59:42.772 --> 59:44.397
come back the next morning.

59:44.557 --> 59:46.732
You really gonna let that man
cart you around in the sky?

59:46.893 --> 59:48.793
Oh, Randy's solid.

59:48.820 --> 59:51.386
Besides, scarlet fever,
car crash.

59:51.448 --> 59:54.148
Third time will be the
charm if it don't kill me.

59:54.242 --> 59:55.557
Patsy!

59:55.618 --> 59:56.968
Huh?

59:56.995 --> 59:57.910
Oh Sorry.

59:58.070 --> 59:59.728
Hey Patsy how are you?

01:00:19.642 --> 01:00:20.766
Well hey there little gal!

01:00:20.927 --> 01:00:22.584
Patsy that you?
I'm damn near blind.

01:00:22.645 --> 01:00:24.495
Oooh, look at you!
You ain't just a dish, girl!

01:00:24.522 --> 01:00:26.163
You're the whole
dang set of china.

01:00:26.191 --> 01:00:29.834
Come here. Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get a good look at her.

01:00:31.488 --> 01:00:33.929
Hey mister, can you
get a shot of this?

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:36.357
How's it feel, Patsy? Knockin'
Kitty Wells off the top spot.

01:00:36.451 --> 01:00:37.950
Oh, well when you put
it that way, Ralph,

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.027
it feels mighty awful.

01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.455
Congratulations anyway.
You too, Loretta.

01:00:42.615 --> 01:00:44.181
Thank you, Ralph.

01:00:44.209 --> 01:00:47.943
Patsy Cline, I'm libel to
run up a gum tree and stick!

01:00:48.004 --> 01:00:48.794
That coat!

01:00:48.955 --> 01:00:50.855
Ooooh, let me touch it.

01:00:50.882 --> 01:00:52.523
Oh hey! Y'all just get here?

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:54.208
No, no, we been gettin' our
picture taken for 20 minutes.

01:00:54.302 --> 01:00:55.526
Apologies ladies,
but mind if I get

01:00:55.553 --> 01:00:56.451
a shot of all y'all together?

01:00:56.513 --> 01:00:59.805
Well sure.

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:05.052
Fourth favorite
female performer.

01:01:05.146 --> 01:01:06.554
I never even thought I'd
make it in the building.

01:01:07.807 --> 01:01:09.131
You'll be first next year.

01:01:09.192 --> 01:01:10.875
What? That's ridiculous.

01:01:10.902 --> 01:01:12.226
You're gonna win ten years in a
row, just like Kitty Wells.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.319
Kitty won for
10 years 'cause for

01:01:13.479 --> 01:01:15.304
10 years Kitty was the only one.

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:20.885
We shouldn't have taken
that picture without her.

01:01:20.912 --> 01:01:23.913
So, we'll take another one.

01:01:28.211 --> 01:01:31.228
What are you doin'?

01:01:31.256 --> 01:01:34.323
You need a powder with a
little more yellow in it.

01:01:34.384 --> 01:01:37.326
My powder's fine.

01:01:37.387 --> 01:01:41.422
For the bruise.

01:01:41.516 --> 01:01:46.093
Oh, my little rascal got to
throwin' his wood blocks...

01:01:46.187 --> 01:01:51.432
Clocked me good.
I almost forgot about that.

01:01:51.526 --> 01:01:55.319
Patsy.

01:02:01.694 --> 01:02:06.521
Charlie and I was just talkin'.

01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:10.359
Started out real calm.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.119
He quit workin', ya know.

01:02:12.213 --> 01:02:13.771
I didn't.

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:16.716
Yeah. We don't need his
paycheck anymore and this gives

01:02:16.876 --> 01:02:21.703
him more time to help with the
kids, so less money for sitters.

01:02:21.764 --> 01:02:25.374
We was just talkin'.

01:02:25.435 --> 01:02:29.895
And its not like we don't...

01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:32.640
Well, sure we get to
hollerin' plenty, but...

01:02:32.734 --> 01:02:37.570
And he shoved me a couple
times but, never this.

01:02:41.659 --> 01:02:44.226
I don't know what went wrong.

01:02:44.287 --> 01:02:46.912
When?

01:02:47.073 --> 01:02:48.914
Couple weeks ago.

01:02:49.075 --> 01:02:51.400
Had his ass thrown in jail.

01:02:51.461 --> 01:02:53.494
Yep. Got a lawyer.
Drew up divorce papers.

01:02:53.588 --> 01:02:54.569
Oh, Patsy.

01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:57.406
No I didn't file 'em.

01:02:57.467 --> 01:03:00.926
He was cryin' and beggin' and
sayin' all the right things

01:03:01.087 --> 01:03:04.930
to get me to drop the charges
and let him back in the house.

01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:06.748
He's been doin' real good since.

01:03:06.809 --> 01:03:11.920
Why didn't you call?

01:03:11.981 --> 01:03:15.166
Still got those papers on
my nightstand, though.

01:03:15.193 --> 01:03:17.985
Right where he can see 'em.

01:03:21.699 --> 01:03:22.840
There he is.

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:25.009
Hey baby, you want a drink?

01:03:25.036 --> 01:03:26.010
Loretta?

01:03:26.037 --> 01:03:26.860
I'm fine.

01:03:26.954 --> 01:03:28.770
You sure? You want a snack?

01:03:28.831 --> 01:03:30.956
I thought I saw some
canapes around here.

01:03:31.117 --> 01:03:33.350
Hey... there's a seafood
tower across the way

01:03:33.378 --> 01:03:34.685
- y'all gotta see to believe.
- I'm fine, baby.

01:03:34.712 --> 01:03:35.795
Hey... you seen Doo?

01:03:35.955 --> 01:03:37.446
Yeah, he's around
here somewhere.

01:03:37.507 --> 01:03:39.298
You know what? I think
I will take a drink.

01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:43.452
What you got? Another whiskey?

01:03:43.513 --> 01:03:45.362
You better get the
hell away from my man

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.305
'cause I don't plan on
takin' these rings off

01:03:46.465 --> 01:03:47.865
before I take
you to fist city.

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:48.957
Oh, we was just talkin'.

01:03:49.018 --> 01:03:51.293
Enough talkin'.

01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:53.887
I don't know what you think
you saw here, honestly.

01:03:53.981 --> 01:03:56.857
Get my coat.

01:04:02.156 --> 01:04:03.714
Some son of a bitch stole it.

01:04:03.741 --> 01:04:05.140
Now, it probably just got hung
with a different ticket.

01:04:05.201 --> 01:04:06.141
She's gonna find it.
I just know it.

01:04:06.202 --> 01:04:09.220
I'm so sorry.

01:04:09.247 --> 01:04:11.997
Don't you say it.

01:04:12.158 --> 01:04:12.890
We don't have the coat.

01:04:16.162 --> 01:04:18.562
Ok.

01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:21.507
I'm gonna get my Mr. Dick
here, we're gonna hire

01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:23.751
a couple of private
dicks and if we find

01:04:23.845 --> 01:04:27.722
who stole my coat,
I am coming for blood.

01:04:33.229 --> 01:04:34.353
So how long y'all back?

01:04:34.513 --> 01:04:35.929
Couple days.
Hey, this'll fit ya.

01:04:38.568 --> 01:04:39.841
Then I got a one
off this weekend,

01:04:39.902 --> 01:04:41.676
and then I'm home for
three whole months.

01:04:41.738 --> 01:04:43.587
I swear, I'm gonna
sleep for two of 'em.

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:46.991
Hey, you can have this too.

01:04:48.578 --> 01:04:49.927
Well, if you don't
like it don't take it.

01:04:49.954 --> 01:04:53.097
No, I'm... I'm being so stupid.

01:04:53.124 --> 01:04:54.765
I'm sorry.

01:04:54.792 --> 01:04:57.543
Hey, what's wrong?

01:04:57.703 --> 01:05:03.466
I'm not for sure.
It's just a feeling, but...

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.636
I think I might
be pregnant again.

01:05:23.821 --> 01:05:25.220
How am I gonna do this?

01:05:25.281 --> 01:05:29.057
Why are you askin' me?
You got twice as many.

01:05:29.118 --> 01:05:30.743
He's out there running
around and I'm gonna

01:05:30.903 --> 01:05:33.137
end up all alone,
five kids, no idea

01:05:33.164 --> 01:05:35.581
how the hell to feed 'em
cause I can't sing no more.

01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.083
Now, hold your horses.
Your voice broke?

01:05:38.244 --> 01:05:40.661
No, I just... I can't be
doin' this pregnant.

01:05:40.755 --> 01:05:42.755
I was singin' at the Opry the
night Randolph popped out.

01:05:42.915 --> 01:05:44.256
You know that story.

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:46.317
I'm not like you.

01:05:46.344 --> 01:05:47.909
Now, don't you pull that
babe in the Kentucky woods

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.154
mess with me, Loretta Lynn.

01:05:50.181 --> 01:05:52.765
What's eatin' you?

01:05:55.594 --> 01:05:59.438
I don't want another one.

01:05:59.598 --> 01:06:05.002
Oh, well. Now, that's
a different doctor.

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:11.024
No. No, no, no. Not for me.

01:06:11.118 --> 01:06:14.695
All this time away, with kids
who can come to the phone...

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:16.455
I mean, that's...
that's hard enough.

01:06:16.615 --> 01:06:19.625
But when they're tiny?

01:06:19.785 --> 01:06:21.443
How am I gonna do this?

01:06:21.504 --> 01:06:24.371
And if I don't, how am I
gonna take care of 'em?

01:06:24.465 --> 01:06:26.357
Betty Sue is real good
with the little ones.

01:06:26.384 --> 01:06:28.300
She... she'll help you.

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.027
And you can get a babysitter.

01:06:30.054 --> 01:06:33.955
Maybe we can share.

01:06:34.016 --> 01:06:35.716
How are they gonna know
how much I love 'em?

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.127
Oh, hey now...

01:06:39.188 --> 01:06:42.314
You got the biggest
heart I've ever known.

01:06:42.474 --> 01:06:47.227
Any baby of yours is gonna
know how much it's loved.

01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:51.657
I hate the way it feels
bein' away. You know?

01:06:51.817 --> 01:06:56.720
I'm not like you.
I can't just turn it off.

01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:59.556
Is that what you think of me?

01:06:59.584 --> 01:07:02.167
Hmm? What do you mean?

01:07:02.328 --> 01:07:08.565
That I don't... that
I don't miss my kids?

01:07:08.593 --> 01:07:12.085
No... No, Patsy,
that's not what I...

01:07:12.179 --> 01:07:13.754
Hmph.

01:07:13.848 --> 01:07:15.830
Of course not!

01:07:15.892 --> 01:07:21.186
Patsy! Patsy, stop!

01:07:21.347 --> 01:07:22.763
Patsy, I'm so sorry!

01:07:22.857 --> 01:07:24.097
Its fine, Loretta.

01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:25.416
You just need money
for a cab or somethin'?

01:07:25.443 --> 01:07:27.601
What? No. See! This! What?!

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:29.862
No, I don't need money for a
cab. What's wrong with you?

01:07:30.022 --> 01:07:32.865
I don't have the luxury of
feelin' any damn thing I want

01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:35.183
any damn time I feel it.

01:07:35.244 --> 01:07:38.037
I have been workin' at
this since I was a kid and

01:07:38.197 --> 01:07:42.266
I'm always one bad
break from bust.

01:07:42.293 --> 01:07:43.784
Not that you would understand.

01:07:43.878 --> 01:07:45.711
Your husband just gives
you a shove and you fall

01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:47.621
face first into a career.

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:48.455
That ain't fair.

01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:49.790
Oh, its not?

01:07:49.884 --> 01:07:51.608
I don't get to
break down, Loretta.

01:07:51.636 --> 01:07:53.201
Ain't nobody to pick me up.

01:07:53.262 --> 01:07:54.219
You got your mama.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.971
Oh, and who puts
food on her table?

01:07:58.392 --> 01:08:00.184
I'm here.

01:08:06.225 --> 01:08:09.485
Just talk to me.

01:08:15.826 --> 01:08:19.152
Daddy didn't leave us.

01:08:19.246 --> 01:08:22.656
That's what we tell people.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.567
He married mama when
she was really young.

01:08:25.627 --> 01:08:30.147
Like you and Doo.

01:08:30.174 --> 01:08:37.412
Mama started gettin' older
and he didn't like that.

01:08:37.473 --> 01:08:40.491
I got older and he...

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:58.033
We left him.

01:09:00.287 --> 01:09:02.078
In the middle of the night.

01:09:03.541 --> 01:09:08.585
Just disappeared.
Never looked back.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:17.803
If I start cryin' I'm
just never gonna stop.

01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:51.486
Hey come on.

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:59.928
Let's get back inside. I don't
want to miss my appointment.

01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:21.942
I need some new drapes.

01:10:22.036 --> 01:10:23.777
Wanna go shoppin' on Monday?

01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:26.446
Shoot yeah.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:27.873
Don't go!

01:10:28.033 --> 01:10:29.374
Come on, baby.
It'll be a real quick trip.

01:10:29.535 --> 01:10:30.709
Mama'll be home soon.

01:10:30.869 --> 01:10:32.544
I'll be home tomorrow
night, m'kay sugar?

01:10:32.704 --> 01:10:34.379
No. Monday. You forget?

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.698
You said yes to that
Cactus Jack memorial.

01:10:38.302 --> 01:10:40.944
I am so sorry.
Really. I didn't...

01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:44.948
Monday's only 24 more hours
from tomorrow, ok sugar?

01:10:44.975 --> 01:10:47.284
Why do you always go?

01:10:47.311 --> 01:10:49.970
I am so sorry baby, but this
is how mama takes care of you.

01:10:50.064 --> 01:10:52.456
No!

01:10:52.483 --> 01:10:54.808
Hey, come on.

01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:57.961
It's ok if you're mad at me.
I'm mad at me.

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:02.407
You be as mad as you want.
But I love you so much.

01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:04.743
And every minute that I'm away
I'm just thinkin' about how

01:11:04.903 --> 01:11:08.413
I'm gonna get home to you, ok?

01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:11.975
I'll make daddy teach me
how to count to 24 hours.

01:11:52.618 --> 01:11:56.203
I know we all loved Cactus Jack.

01:11:56.297 --> 01:12:00.281
He was a special part of
our country music family.

01:12:00.342 --> 01:12:07.030
So tonight, I'm gonna sing
his favorite of my records.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:09.933

Ladies and

01:14:54.975 --> 01:14:58.702
this is the hardest job
I have ever had to do.

01:14:58.729 --> 01:15:01.721
It pains me greatly to
announce that Patsy Cline,

01:15:01.815 --> 01:15:06.634
Hawkshaw Hawkins, Cowboy
Copas, and Randy Hughes

01:15:06.695 --> 01:15:10.471
flying from Kansas City to
Nashville have crashed

01:15:10.532 --> 01:15:13.383
in the area of
Camden, Tennessee.

01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:17.162
After an all night search
involving bad weather,

01:15:17.322 --> 01:15:19.664
the plane has finally
been located and

01:15:19.825 --> 01:15:23.043
all aboard have perished.

01:16:34.575 --> 01:16:37.576
You need anything?
Can I feed ya?

01:16:37.736 --> 01:16:41.654
We just came to say goodbye.

01:16:41.748 --> 01:16:43.640
Ok. Oh, hey, I think your
friends are down there

01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:44.749
messin' with the chicken coop.

01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:46.159
You wanna go run down
there and see 'em?

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:49.813
You think so? Yeah?
Ok, go on. Ok.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.997
Go on. We'll catch up with ya.

01:16:51.091 --> 01:16:55.427
Let's go!

01:16:58.182 --> 01:17:00.323
I think we might come
back in a month or so.

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:01.992
After things settle. For a...

01:17:02.019 --> 01:17:07.088

01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.922

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:12.760
No, just to Roanoke.

01:17:15.607 --> 01:17:19.676
How is Charlie takin' it?

01:17:19.703 --> 01:17:22.937
He knows he's not in any
shape to take care of anyone.

01:17:22.998 --> 01:17:26.374
He doesn't like it, but
he's not fightin' it.

01:17:29.463 --> 01:17:36.876
Well, maybe I'll go on by
there and see how he's doin'.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:42.015
