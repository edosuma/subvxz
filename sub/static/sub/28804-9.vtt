Twice deployed in Iraq,

Came home,
beat his girlfriend to death.

was screwing the girlfriend.

09:16.417 --> 09:19.458

in VA psychiatrists to testify,

He spent six months
at a state hospital

ever since he got out.

why can't you arrest him?

In seven years of arrests,

09:36.125 --> 09:38.417

Lamar spent a grand total

ahead of yourself.

10:58.208 --> 11:01.166

11:01.250 --> 11:03.041

-Jesus Christ!

11:07.667 --> 11:09.667
-Who the fuck are you?
-It's a home invasion!

11:09.750 --> 11:12.709
Annie, Walter,
keep your voices down.

11:12.792 --> 11:15.083
This is not
a home invasion.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.125
What... What
do you want?

11:17.208 --> 11:20.000
My associate, Detective Dillon,
is downstairs.

11:20.083 --> 11:21.583
He would like a word
with you, Walter.

11:21.667 --> 11:25.083
-Why?
-No, no, I know
a Detective Dillon.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.709
What is this about?

11:26.792 --> 11:28.583
Come downstairs
and we'll explain.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.542
I would've had him
come up, but...

11:30.625 --> 11:32.959
his face is covered
in stitches.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.750
It's a little
distracting.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.542
And for
the record,

11:37.625 --> 11:40.542
Walter did not forget
to set the alarm tonight.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.333
Let me tell you a story.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.500
After the story,
if you still feel like

11:45.583 --> 11:48.333
kicking my face in, or worse,

11:48.417 --> 11:52.208
well, then, at least
you have the information
you need to move forward.

11:52.291 --> 11:53.500
Please, sit down.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.667
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful woman,

12:02.750 --> 12:04.542
not your garden-variety
beautiful.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.917
This woman was
dramatically attractive.

12:09.959 --> 12:13.166
She had perfect skin, and...

12:14.458 --> 12:17.625
full lips, and when she smiled,

12:19.291 --> 12:21.959
it could melt an iceberg.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.458
And her name was Cristelle.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.291
And I was so in love with her.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.667
And she loved me, too.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.834
I believe that.

12:35.250 --> 12:39.333
The problem was
that she was pregnant
with another man's child.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.166
This man,
he was a dangerous man.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.125
He was a real gangster.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.291
He's Charlie Baudelaire.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.792
And Charlie,

12:52.875 --> 12:55.667
well, he did not take
kindly to her telling him

12:55.750 --> 12:57.208
that she had feelings
for another man

12:57.291 --> 13:00.542
while she was carrying
his child in her womb.

13:02.959 --> 13:05.166
Well, Charlie yelled at her,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.291
and he beat her,
and he called her a whore.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.417
In retrospect,
I believe we severely

13:14.500 --> 13:17.333
underestimated
her power over us.

13:17.834 --> 13:21.166
We thought we were tussling
over a fashion model.

13:26.291 --> 13:27.834

-Answer me this one thing,

13:39.208 --> 13:40.834

the truth this time.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.417

-(scoffs)

13:42.500 --> 13:44.000

-Oh, you see?

13:44.083 --> 13:46.041
Yeah, well, I don't care
for that kind of language.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.208
I don't give a shit what kind
of language you care for.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.750
If I gave a shit, I wouldn't
be talking at all, would I?

13:51.834 --> 13:55.250
-You know, you're
not making any sense.
-I'm making all the sense.

13:55.917 --> 13:58.000
(sighs) Yeah, maybe you
shouldn't drink so much.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.834

13:59.917 --> 14:04.041

14:16.041 --> 14:17.625

14:17.709 --> 14:19.208

14:19.291 --> 14:20.834

Charlie knows best.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.667
No, sir! Yes, sir!

14:31.750 --> 14:33.458

14:33.542 --> 14:36.375
-Mrs. Baudelaire.
-What ever happened
to keep Bennie out of this?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.583
Why can't you just tuck me in?

14:38.667 --> 14:40.667

15:22.333 --> 15:24.333

16:15.750 --> 16:17.458
When the baby was born,

16:17.542 --> 16:20.834
Charlie sent some men
to steal it from her...

16:21.875 --> 16:24.500
because he knew that if it
was raised under her hand,

16:24.583 --> 16:27.291
the child would grow
to hate his father,

16:27.375 --> 16:28.750
and he would not
have a proper heir

16:28.834 --> 16:31.041
for the business
he was building.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.458
So, Charlie brought Junior here,

16:34.542 --> 16:36.709
and he raised him in the States.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.166
And I dated this woman...

16:42.083 --> 16:45.375
in the aftermath
of this awful tragedy.

16:48.709 --> 16:52.458
A mother having her
child stolen from her.

Many years later,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.583
I learned that Junior
was in Marseilles,

18:18.667 --> 18:21.041
doing business
in his father's name.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.333
He is buying

So, I insert myself
into this evening.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.458
And I watch him,

18:36.375 --> 18:38.375
and I talk to him.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.125
It's Junior.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.125
His eyes reminded me so much

18:47.208 --> 18:49.917
of my dearly departed Cristelle.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.583
Her death was no accident.

So, I am boring you.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.750
Only a little.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.000
Well, that evening in Marseilles

19:13.083 --> 19:16.041
was one of degenerate
debauchery.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.917
There were drugs,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.709
fucking, beatings,
what have you.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.458
And I make sure that Junior

19:24.542 --> 19:28.291
is roasted and toasted
beyond fucking imagination...

19:30.709 --> 19:33.375
so that when he wakes
up in the morning

19:33.458 --> 19:36.542
with three underage
male prostitutes

19:36.625 --> 19:38.792
chopped in pieces,

19:39.917 --> 19:41.583
well,

19:41.667 --> 19:43.875
he's beside himself.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.417
And I help him.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.709
And I counseled him.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.250
I clean up his mess.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.166
-Do you follow
what I am saying?
-Yes.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.250
I don't think that you do.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.667
No matter how Charlie
tried to raise his child

20:01.750 --> 20:03.625
to do as he was told,

20:03.709 --> 20:05.333
Junior grew up spiteful.

20:05.417 --> 20:08.750
A snake snapping at its
own tail, so you used that.

20:10.625 --> 20:14.125
You can imagine the level
of gratitude he feels for me.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.041
You can imagine
the immense debt he owes me,

20:17.125 --> 20:20.291

I won't do anything
more for you.

20:47.959 --> 20:51.000
I assume you came
in the hopes of killing me.
