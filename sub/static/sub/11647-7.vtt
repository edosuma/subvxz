24:38.280 --> 24:40.749
Everything used to be so simple.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.997
Like, you'd just meet someone
and you'd like them

24:44.040 --> 24:46.111
and then you'd go on a date
with each other.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.913

and everything gets fucked.

42:49.240 --> 42:53.074
It's the jumper and it has started
and still none of you believe me.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.316
Well, this <i>is...</i> This is our destiny.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.391
Come on.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.033
Why not?

43:26.960 --> 43:28.359
We're getting a better name.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.192
We're gonna be unstoppable.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.310
RUDY 2: It's your superhero lair.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.192
They are your costumes.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.436
Your secret identity.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.039
Let's do some good.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.119
Are you going to pick that up?

43:49.920 --> 43:50.990
Agh!

43:51.040 --> 43:55.671
Today is the last day
of your community service.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.394
This is as good as it gets for you.

43:58.440 --> 44:01.558
Oh, my God!
That <i>is...</i> That's a man flying.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.398
(GROANS)

44:04.560 --> 44:06.551
I loved you.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.635
I'm sorry.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.751
I've made a terrible error of judgment.

44:11.760 --> 44:12.955
They tried to kill me.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.391
Well, they chose the wrong day
to do that, Finlay.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.510
They're coming.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.517
I suppose you'd better kill them.
