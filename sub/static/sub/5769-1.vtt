WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:04.499
(knocking)

00:08.800 --> 00:10.336
Thanks for doing this here.

00:10.370 --> 00:11.735
No problem.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.271
What are you thinking?

00:13.310 --> 00:16.302
I'm in.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.239
With Agos/Florrick?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.542
(laughs)

00:20.580 --> 00:21.808
FIorrick/Agos.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.283
(laughs)

00:23.320 --> 00:24.514
Carey in litigation;

00:24.550 --> 00:26.313
Jeremy, family law;

00:26.360 --> 00:28.055
Andre, acquisitions.

00:28.090 --> 00:29.819
They all wanted to join;
they're all good.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.157
I agree.

00:31.190 --> 00:32.225
And what about Kalinda?

00:34.230 --> 00:35.595
No. Robyn.

00:35.630 --> 00:36.722
Why not Kalinda?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.192
Money.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.561
Are you okay with that?

00:39.600 --> 00:40.737
Yeah.

00:40.770 --> 00:41.794
Just kind of weird.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.262
Everything's ending.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.164
Beginning to.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.370
(phone vibrating)

00:51.180 --> 00:53.569
So...

00:53.620 --> 00:55.645
how are we gonna tell them?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.840
VVho?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.289
Will and Diane.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.083
Oh, (scoffs) it's
the circle of life.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.781
They had to leave
their old law firms

01:01.820 --> 01:03.253
to start
Lockhart/Gardner.

01:03.290 --> 01:04.757
I have the death row appeal
on Thursday.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.189
I will tell them after that.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.857
We have to get
some office space anyway.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.720
Unless you want to take
the Sweeney offer?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.658
(laughs)

01:11.700 --> 01:12.837
No.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.589
Oh, hey.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.369
Congratulations,

01:17.410 --> 01:18.832
Mrs. First Lady.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.532
(chuckles)

01:22.550 --> 01:23.699
Oh, wow.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.240
Immw.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.361
(whispering):
What time is it?

01:45.930 --> 01:47.830
It's been two hours
and ten minutes.

01:47.870 --> 01:50.407
Is that normal?

01:50.440 --> 01:52.431
No.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.446
Is that one of the moms?

01:57.480 --> 01:59.175
Mrs. Henning.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.889
God, she must hate us.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.621
I will now read the warrant.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.695
"Whereas Eddie Alan Fornum,

02:19.740 --> 02:22.868
"on the 26th of May, 1999,

02:22.910 --> 02:25.799
"murdered both Lynn Gore
and Susan Henning,

02:25.840 --> 02:29.674
and whereas Eddie
Alan Fornum..."

02:32.850 --> 02:34.818
"...and whereas

02:34.850 --> 02:37.887
"Eddie Alan Fornum was
adjudicated guilty of two counts

02:37.920 --> 02:40.252
"of murder in the first degree
and sentenced to death,

02:40.290 --> 02:42.679
we will now carry
out the sentence."

02:42.730 --> 02:46.154
Mr. Fornum, do you
have any last words?

02:49.600 --> 02:53.195
I'm sorry to everyone here.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.403
To my new lavwers,

02:56.440 --> 02:58.237
Diane and Alicia,

02:58.270 --> 03:02.206
I have a favor to
ask of you both.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.478
Please...

03:04.980 --> 03:06.516
...if you could...

03:06.550 --> 03:09.519
go see my mom.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.455
I was her only son,

03:14.490 --> 03:16.924
and I was a disappointment.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.659
To the parents

03:22.700 --> 03:26.238
of Miss Henning and Miss Gore,

03:26.270 --> 03:27.532
I am sorry

03:27.570 --> 03:30.004
what happened
to your daughters,

03:30.040 --> 03:32.372
but I did not do this.

03:32.410 --> 03:34.708
And I wish...

03:34.740 --> 03:37.800
I wish I could say
what was happening

03:37.850 --> 03:39.545
(crowd gasps)
here tonight was just,

03:39.580 --> 03:41.878
because that might
bring you some...

03:41.920 --> 03:44.388
because that might make...

03:45.850 --> 03:49.525
(urgent chattering)

03:51.860 --> 03:53.851
They're having trouble
finding a line.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.507
Ma'am, please sit down.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.711
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to sit down right now.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.344
I want to talk to the warden.
Ma'am, I need you to
sit down right now.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.348
You got to go
and sit down right now.
OFFICER: Let's go, let's go.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.539
Warden?
Excuse me, go back
to your seat.

04:18.590 --> 04:19.955
Warden Barkin,
I need to speak with you!

04:19.990 --> 04:21.480
All right, let's go.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.283
Warden Barkin!

04:23.330 --> 04:24.456
We're Eddie's lavwers;
you can't just...

04:24.490 --> 04:25.718
Yes, we can and we will.
(door buzzes)

04:25.760 --> 04:29.298
Wait.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.389
Sir, this is an Eighth
Amendment violation.

04:31.430 --> 04:32.590
Lower your voice,

04:32.640 --> 04:33.732
Miss Lockhart.

04:33.770 --> 04:34.759
I know, we're all tense.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.008
Our two medical technicians
are haVIng trouble

04:38.040 --> 04:39.598
finding a suitable vein.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.437
But that is all.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.368
_ Mr. Fornum was
an Intravenous drug user,

04:43.410 --> 04:44.377
and many of his
veins have collapsed.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.810
You have been trying for
two hours and 20 minutes

04:46.850 --> 04:47.976
to find a vein?

04:50.020 --> 04:53.080
Yes, but we're now attempting
to run a line in his foot.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.782
This is torture; this is
the definition of torture.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.549
That's not for you
to say, ma'am.
That's right.

04:57.590 --> 04:58.488
It's for the court.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.418
Broom v. Strickland.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.395
Thi_s execution is
a direct VIolatIon

05:03.430 --> 05:04.590
of Eighth Amendment
protections,

05:04.630 --> 05:06.530
and it should be delayed

05:06.570 --> 05:10.062
until you can ensure its
proper administration.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.631
(elevator bell dings)

05:19.620 --> 05:21.747
Hi, could you open
the door for me?

05:21.780 --> 05:24.681
Uh... sure.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.449
Hi, I'm Monica
in litigation.

05:26.490 --> 05:27.855
I'm teleconferencing from home.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.050
Ah.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.058
WILL: Okay, settle
down, everybody.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.990
DIANE (over intercom):
Just got out of court.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.396
We need to pursue an
evidentiary path to an appeal.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.624
Clearly it's
a long shot...

05:36.670 --> 05:39.093
Just shut the door on it.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.597
_ _ _WILL:
AllCla just got here.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.538
DIANE: Good. She has
the legal aid work.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.561
They want us to take point
on the appeal.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.668
And when is the execution now?

05:44.710 --> 05:45.768
ALICIA:
Saturday, midnight.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.607
It's been delayed 48 hours.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.607
(crowd grumbling)

05:48.640 --> 05:49.572
Look, it's a second chance.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.975
That's all we need.
Robyn, take us through.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.046
Eddie Alan Fornum was arrested

05:53.080 --> 05:55.617
in July, 1999, for murdering

05:55.650 --> 05:57.584
two 17-year-old girls
outside of a movie theater

05:57.620 --> 05:59.781
in South Bend
after a botched carjacking.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.651
Eddie had an alibi,
but he was found

06:01.690 --> 06:03.555
in possession
of one of the girls' necklaces.

06:03.590 --> 06:04.386
Which he bought
at a flea market.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.454
And his hair was found
on the body.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.651
DIANE: That's where we want
to focus our appeal.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.520
We don't think it's Eddie's hair
on the body,

06:09.570 --> 06:12.164
and we're subpoenaing
the forensic lab to retest it.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.565
What about the snitch?

06:13.600 --> 06:14.794
He's the real reason
that Eddie was convicted.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.034
He died six years ago.

06:16.070 --> 06:17.606
I don't think
we'd find much there.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.039
Okay, so we'll break up
into groups.

06:19.070 --> 06:21.573
Tonya, you work the team
on witnesses and testimony.

06:21.610 --> 06:22.747
Carey, the forensics.
Robyn, the background

06:22.780 --> 06:23.769
of the experts.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.540
(garbled transmission)

06:27.720 --> 06:29.745
Thanks, Monica.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.439
Good point.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.549
Am I really needed here
or can I go?

06:33.590 --> 06:34.557
We have 48 hours.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.649
Let's make them c_ount.
Cary, hold on a minute.

06:36.690 --> 06:37.588
Uh, me?

06:37.630 --> 06:38.779
No, Cary-Cary.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.025
Diane, that's not enough time,
is it?

06:41.060 --> 06:43.426
To get a subpoena on the hair
and test it, no.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.028
Okay, you work
your evidentiary track,

06:45.070 --> 06:46.128
and I'll grab Cary and Alicia

06:46.170 --> 06:47.489
and we'll try to buy you
more time.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.689
How?

06:48.740 --> 06:50.935
I have no idea.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.528
Diane?

06:52.580 --> 06:53.535
Yes?_
I was getting...

06:53.580 --> 06:54.501
Excuse me.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.701
I was getting a subpoena
to retest the hair.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.978
Yes?
Someone already retested it

06:58.010 --> 07:00.478
in the prosecutor's office
six years ago.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.010
Right, for an appeal.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.688
No, not in the office
in Indiana,

07:03.720 --> 07:04.948
the one here in Chicago.

07:04.990 --> 07:06.810
Someone tested it here.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.488
Why?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.986
Your dad knows Barry Scheck?

07:11.030 --> 07:13.919
Yeah, he did. Why?

07:13.960 --> 07:15.598
He's in federal court
on an Eighth Amendment

07:15.630 --> 07:17.461
class action right now.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.922
Call him.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.562
Hey, Cary, what's up?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.704
Barry... Mr. Scheck,

07:22.740 --> 07:25.959
we need some help on the
Eddie Alan Fornum appeal.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.069
Oh, I heard his execution
was delayed.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.179
What do you need?

07:29.210 --> 07:30.700
We were hoping to contribute
to your class action.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.615
Well, I don't know

07:32.650 --> 07:34.845
if the judge is gonna let him
join this far along.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.689
I know; we don't want to join.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.751
Hey, I'm glad you're
coming with us.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.822
Oh, hey, uh, Cary
told me the good news.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.623
Can I tell the clients?
What?

07:47.660 --> 07:49.196
The governor's wife is
joining our new firm.

07:49.230 --> 07:50.527
It's a selling point.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.629
No, please don't.

07:52.670 --> 07:55.559
Well, that's not what I said.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.502
(elevator bell dings)

08:07.550 --> 08:10.041
Get rid of those,
and let's talk.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.887
Get out of my way!

08:17.890 --> 08:19.551
Here's what I need.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.750
All the phone numbers called
by the fourth-year associates

08:21.800 --> 08:24.166
over the last three months.
Why?

08:24.200 --> 08:27.260
I think the fourth-years
are intending to leave

08:27.300 --> 08:29.768
and take some
of our clients with them.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.630
Why do you think that?

08:31.670 --> 08:33.171
Because I'm psychic.

08:33.210 --> 08:34.700
Well, I can't legally access
their calls.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.207
They're using
the company cell phones.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.946
They're not their phones,
they're ours.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.299
Just get me

08:39.350 --> 08:40.669
the metadata.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.517
I want to see
who they're calling.

08:46.050 --> 08:48.917
Eli, I'm on a death row appeal;
I don't have time.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.780
ELI:
I know, but this is important.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.320
Eli, did you just hear me?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.998
I said, "death row appeal."

08:54.030 --> 08:56.794
Oh, I thought
that was hyperbole.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.661
Uh, but you agreed to 4:00.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.769
We've already delayed twice.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.994
Where's the hair testimony?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.837
Eli...

09:02.870 --> 09:06.704
Look, any time after Saturday
I can do this, not today.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.207
Okay, Sunday at noon?

09:08.240 --> 09:09.400
At 7:00. What is it again?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.670
It's the basic ethics talk _
for the governor-elect's family.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.575
Okay, we're
changing strategies.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.019
Got to go, Eli.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.288
Peter?

09:18.320 --> 09:20.311
WOMAN:
Mr. Gold?

09:22.790 --> 09:25.088
I'm Marilyn Garbanza,
executive director

09:25.130 --> 09:26.825
of the Illinois
Ethics Commission.

09:28.630 --> 09:29.824
We have a 4:00.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.167
Actually, I have a 4:00

09:31.200 --> 09:33.930
with a Mitch Garbanza.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.039
Yes, that's me.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.833
Governor Quinn
used to call me Mitch.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.201
Why?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.776
I have no idea.

09:39.810 --> 09:40.777
Okay.

09:40.810 --> 09:43.870
Um, Mrs. Florrick,

09:43.910 --> 09:46.845
unfortunately,
has to reschedule

09:46.880 --> 09:49.747
for Sunday at 7:00,
if that's all right.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.939
That is all right. Thank you.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.116
I'll see you then.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.727
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.260
The choice isn't actionable;
I want to be clear.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.892
I know, you're just
raising a red flag.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.136
What are we discussing here?

10:07.170 --> 10:09.092
Eli, you've met Marilyn?

10:09.140 --> 10:10.334
Just a few seconds ago
in your office.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.873
Marilyn has some
concerns about Mickey.

10:12.910 --> 10:14.878
Our chief of staff?
Oh, I didn't know
he was chosen yet.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.799
PETER: He hasn't been yet,
but he is our top choice.

10:17.850 --> 10:18.600
So Marilyn's concerned
that Mickey

10:18.650 --> 10:20.015
hired you
as a crisis counselor.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.286
It could look like
a conflict of interest.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.412
Because I ran
the search committee?

10:24.450 --> 10:26.111
Yes.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.152
Again, I'm not here to
say you can't hire him.

10:28.190 --> 10:29.828
I don't have that power.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.283
I'm just saying it could look
ethically compromised.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.991
Okay, we'll look into it.
Thanks.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.122
Okay.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.252
Thank you, Marilyn.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.965
She's doing her job, Eli.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.534
Currently,
Indiana protocols...

10:45.570 --> 10:47.879
...has insufficient protections
built in that guarantee...

10:47.910 --> 10:48.934
...a painless execution...

10:48.980 --> 10:50.299
The printer,
the mobile printer.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.375
(elevator bell dings)
Okay, I'll go get it.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.758
MONICA:
Hi.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.917
New innovation?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.120
Test program.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.889
So how does it feel

11:04.930 --> 11:06.898
to be first lady
of Illinois?

11:06.930 --> 11:08.921
(chuckles)
Weird.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.020
Kind of like...
first galactic princess.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.992
(both laugh)

11:18.010 --> 11:20.103
I'm sorry I didn't get back
to you the other night.

11:20.140 --> 11:21.368
Hey, you've been celebrating,

11:21.410 --> 11:22.809
you've been on death row,
it's been...

11:22.850 --> 11:24.078
A weird few days.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.817
But we can talk...

11:26.850 --> 11:28.078
When this is over.
Don't worry.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.439
Well, I... I was hoping to...

11:29.480 --> 11:31.243
CARY:
All right, I got it.

11:38.030 --> 11:38.883
ASA Pine.

11:38.930 --> 11:40.921
Ms. Lockhart.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.927
Hello.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.892
You worked at
the South Bend

11:42.930 --> 11:44.989
prosecutor's office,
didn't you?
A while ago.

11:45.030 --> 11:47.169
Why? Do we know
someone...?

11:47.200 --> 11:48.462
_You were
the a55istant prosecutor

11:48.500 --> 11:50.400
on the Eddie Fornum
homicide.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.778
Do you know
how we know that?

11:55.810 --> 11:57.004
I don't care.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.847
You had Eddie's
hair retested

11:58.880 --> 11:59.949
six years ago.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.039
Ms. Lockhart,
I'm not talking to you.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.342
They're going
to execute him.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.743
They tried once

12:04.790 --> 12:05.882
and they're going
to execute him

12:05.920 --> 12:06.887
in 48 hours.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.026
And you had ten years
to appeal his execution.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.527
Don't come to me
with 40 hours left.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.424
You think he's innocent.

12:12.460 --> 12:13.927
(sighs)

12:13.960 --> 12:15.496
I think you're
out of time.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.725
Just give us
the hair test.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.969
Will, I have a lead,
but I need time.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.160
That is a very good point,
Your Honor.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.132
That wasn't a point, Mr. Scheck.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.001
I just wanted you to finish.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.338
Well, uh, let me address
that point, if I may...

12:29.380 --> 12:31.177
(door opens)

12:31.210 --> 12:34.338
Uh, but before I do,

12:34.380 --> 12:37.019
let me introduce
my co-counsel...

12:37.050 --> 12:38.187
(quietly):
Will Gardner.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.348
...Will Gardner,
joining the case.

12:41.390 --> 12:42.926
Your Honor,
if it pleases the court,

12:42.960 --> 12:45.224
we ask that the execution
of Eddie Alan Fornum

12:45.260 --> 12:47.057
be delayed until...
Your Honor...

12:47.100 --> 12:48.988
I'm way, way ahead of you,
Ms. Cesca.

12:49.030 --> 12:51.362
You know, it doesn't
please the court.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.391
Not very much
pleases the court these days.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.260
But your guy is not
gonna join this suit.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.528
Now, what else do you have?

12:56.570 --> 12:57.662
You misunderstand me,
Your Honor.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.564
We're not looking for Eddie Alan
Fornum to join the suit.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.975
We're looking for him
to be the evidence.

13:01.010 --> 13:03.376
ALICIA:
Mr. Fornum's testimony

13:03.410 --> 13:06.846
is the most relevant
as to how much pain is suffered

13:06.880 --> 13:08.518
in the subject
of lethal injection

13:08.550 --> 13:10.586
because he was the subject
of lethal injection.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.042
Your Honor, I am speechless.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.250
Me, too.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.087
I am speechless.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.519
And yet intrigued.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.720
Go on.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.399
If Mr. Fornum is executed,
the state will have destroyed

13:20.430 --> 13:22.125
crucial evidence
for the plaintiff.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.264
Your Honor, they are trying
to delay an execution.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.995
Of course they are.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.998
How much time do you need
to depose him?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.008
Six weeks.
A month.
Three days.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.029
KLUGER:
All right.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.332
You have till Monday.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.509
LENA:
Your Honor...
Just relax, all right?

13:34.540 --> 13:37.304
The State of Indiana
can execute him on Tuesday.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.238
Now, look, I know
what you three

13:39.280 --> 13:41.077
are doing, but
y-you're not gonna

13:41.120 --> 13:42.473
save your guy
with schemes.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.181
You're gonna buy him
a little time.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.312
You're not gonna save him.

13:45.350 --> 13:46.612
Time is all we need, Your Honor.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.481
And please use it well.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.056
Get on with Kalinda.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.921
We bought her another 48 hours.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.069
(phones ringing)

14:05.110 --> 14:07.328
Governor-elect Florrick's
office. Please hold.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.478
You're sure you
don't need anything?

14:11.510 --> 14:13.011
Yeah, I'm sure.
Thanks.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.317
I'm fine, thanks.

14:18.350 --> 14:20.454
Four of the last eight
governors of Illinois

14:20.490 --> 14:22.310
have gone to prison.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.487
Four of the last eight.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.157
Which is why we
need to remember

14:26.190 --> 14:27.657
that the spouse
and the children

14:27.700 --> 14:29.497
are an extension
of the governor.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.669
Your choices
become his ch0ices.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.498
Now, I've looked over your work
at Lockhart/Gardner, Alicia.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.666
There shouldn't be
any problem there,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.509
as long as you don't
actively solicit clients

14:37.540 --> 14:40.407
who have business_with
the governor's office,

14:40.440 --> 14:41.634
and that your relationship
with the governor

14:41.680 --> 14:43.648
isn't used as a lure to clients.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.308
It should not look like
Peter is receivmg

14:46.350 --> 14:48.409
backdoor remuneration
through your busmess.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.088
And that your clients
shouldn't believe

14:50.120 --> 14:51.417
that your spousal
connection...

14:51.450 --> 14:52.485
(quietly):
We need to talk.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.488
About?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.317
We need to talk.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.089
I'm starting
my own firm.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.620
You're...

15:01.660 --> 15:02.456
VVhen?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.161
Next week.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.690
Me, Cary and ten others.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.459
Peter, I wanted
to tell you yesterday,

15:07.500 --> 15:09.639
but there_ was
just no time.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.501
That's fantastic!

15:11.540 --> 15:13.576
You've been wanting to do
this since law school.

15:13.610 --> 15:16.408
I know. But I'm just
worried that...

15:16.440 --> 15:17.976
it might complicate
your ethical issues.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.546
(scoffs)
Oh, Marilyn was covering

15:19.580 --> 15:21.571
all the spousal conflict
of interest issues.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.042
Have you told Will?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.079
And Diane?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.485
No. Not yet.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.487
Uh, just you two.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.487
I'm damn proud of you.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.612
Damn proud of you.
(phone ringing)

15:29.660 --> 15:30.729
Thank you.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.580
I'm so sorry,
I have to get this.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.325
ALICIA:
I am on my way.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.349
What?

15:36.400 --> 15:38.960
(door buzzes)

15:39.000 --> 15:41.434
EDDIE: There were two
nurses, a man and a woman.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.131
And they had
the needles.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.398
And they tried to put them

15:44.440 --> 15:47.568
into the veins of my right
and my left arm.

15:47.610 --> 15:48.474
How many times?

15:48.510 --> 15:50.398
I again object
to this line of questioning

15:50.450 --> 15:51.348
as a delaying tactic.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.348
Do you want to get
the judge on the line?

15:53.380 --> 15:54.517
What, and delay this
even more?

15:54.550 --> 15:55.972
Go ahead, Eddie.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.510
Well, then another
nurse came on--

15:57.550 --> 15:59.211
a head one, I guess--

15:59.250 --> 16:01.559
and he tried again
on this arm,

16:01.590 --> 16:03.387
but something
really hurt.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.022
Can you show us where
on your arms?

16:05.060 --> 16:06.550
Objection.
Good, let's get the judge.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.353
I'm preserving my objection
for the record.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.288
ALICIA:
Go on, Eddie.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.729
GUARD:
No, I'll do it.

16:22.740 --> 16:25.049
ALICIA:
So, after that,

16:25.080 --> 16:26.547
they went to your neck?
Yeah.

16:26.580 --> 16:29.572
I guess there was a
lot blood, because...

16:29.620 --> 16:31.383
I heard the guy
say "oops,"

16:31.420 --> 16:34.218
and the female nurse
had to leave the room.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.682
Why did she have
to leave the room?

16:35.720 --> 16:38.382
I don't know,
but she was crying.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.556
Do you remember her name?

16:39.590 --> 16:40.557
"Joan," Your Honor.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.658
That's all we know.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.565
But I'm sure the AUSA
can locate her.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.023
Your Honor,
the identity of nurses

16:46.070 --> 16:48.197
at Indiana State
is kept confidential

16:48.240 --> 16:49.593
so that it doesn't
become known

16:49.640 --> 16:51.335
that they participated
in an execution.

16:51.370 --> 16:52.632
ALICIA: Yes, but that doesn't
shield them from questioning.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.069
We would assert
that it does.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.737
KLUGER: Really? You're
asserting some kind

16:55.780 --> 16:57.577
of immunity, Ms. Cesca?
Your Honor,
we need to have

16:57.610 --> 16:59.100
a hearing on
this question.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.378
KLUGER:
Hold on, hold on.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.172
Ms. Cesca, any
thoughts about

17:02.220 --> 17:04.040
walking that one back?
LENA: We apologize,
Your Honor.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.580
We agree there would be
no immunity,

17:05.620 --> 17:08.180
but Mr. Gardner
is merely using

17:08.220 --> 17:09.209
this deposition as a ploy.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.488
Your Honor!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.226
And he will insist
that Mr. Fornum be kept alive

17:13.260 --> 17:14.659
for his_ rebuttal
testimony.
No.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.691
No.

17:16.730 --> 17:19.164
I was merely
going to insist

17:19.200 --> 17:21.065
that the AUSA is trying
to destroy evidence

17:21.100 --> 17:22.738
by expediting
this execution.
KLUGER:
No, no, no.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.739
I'm not gonna delay
this execution any longer.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.772
How soon can you have
that nurse available?

17:27.810 --> 17:29.505
Tomorrow afternoon.
That's not nearly
enough time!

17:29.540 --> 17:30.302
It'll be too late then...

17:30.350 --> 17:31.749
Shut up.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.213
Tomorrow afternoon

17:33.250 --> 17:34.774
after Mr. Fornum's
been executed?

17:34.820 --> 17:35.377
Well, that's just coincidence.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.717
KLUGER:
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.445
Make her available
this afternoon

17:38.490 --> 17:40.458
for a supervised deposition
or be held in contempt.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.651
(gavelbangs)

17:42.690 --> 17:44.282
How did you get back here?

17:44.330 --> 17:45.558
I needed to use
the bathroom.

17:45.590 --> 17:46.557
Call security!

17:46.590 --> 17:48.729
You quit Indiana a month
after convicting Fornum.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.466
You know something is
wrong with this case.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.626
You know
he's innocent.

17:51.670 --> 17:52.728
He's not innocent.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.397
You retested
the hair evidence.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.668
Why would you
do that unless...

17:55.700 --> 17:57.338
Because I thought I was wrong.

17:57.370 --> 17:58.735
I wasn't.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.169
The test came back
con5istent

18:00.210 --> 18:02.303
with Fornum's hair.
I don't believe you.

18:02.340 --> 18:04.205
Last page.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.672
There.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.246
That doesn't mean
it's his hair.
You're right.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.748
But it does_mean there's
no convmcmg you.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.389
Why did you do it
six years ago?

18:15.420 --> 18:16.717
Excuse me?
Why did you

18:16.760 --> 18:18.580
double-check the hair
evidence six years ago?

18:18.630 --> 18:19.528
What do you mean?

18:19.560 --> 18:21.255
Well, the date of this report

18:21.300 --> 18:23.564
is one week after the snitch,
Tommy Diehause, died.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.668
You thought he might be lying?

18:27.700 --> 18:28.894
I don't have time...

18:28.940 --> 18:30.464
DIANE: No, Eddie Fornum
doesn't have time.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.206
He escaped execution once;
he won't a second time.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.901
This is the moment
to come forward, Ms. Pine.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.908
Please.
SHERIFF:
You called security?

18:36.940 --> 18:39.408
It's all right.

18:42.550 --> 18:45.246
I was using Diehause
on another case.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.814
He snitched on
a top drug dealer

18:46.850 --> 18:50.752
in exchange for
his freedom...

18:50.790 --> 18:51.882
and a new identity.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.852
(gasps)

18:53.900 --> 18:56.152
Will, the snitch is still alive.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.827
He's using the alias...
Robbie Walker.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.326
Kalinda, we have a lead.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.860
We think he's still
in the Illinois area.

19:00.900 --> 19:01.867
Forget the hair.
It's a dead end.

19:01.900 --> 19:02.867
It's the snitch.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.367
But we need more time
to find him.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.538
Robbie Walker,
aka Tommy Diehause.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.869
What'd you find out?

19:11.910 --> 19:13.719
The snitch is still alive,
but we're having...

19:13.750 --> 19:15.547
No, about the fourth-year
phone calls.

19:16.450 --> 19:17.917
Do you want me
in this meeting?

19:17.950 --> 19:19.645
Dear God. Go away!

19:19.690 --> 19:21.510
I haven't looked
into the calls yet.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.515
Yes, you have.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.686
I checked with
our provider.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.879
They said they sent you
the records.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.296
Then why do
you need me?
Maybe I don't.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.719
Here's another
question for you:

19:29.760 --> 19:31.762
Why aren't you
doing your job?

19:31.800 --> 19:34.963
You have a complaint,
you go to Will or Diane.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.729
Is this about Cary?

19:38.370 --> 19:39.803
Or are you thinking of
leaving with them?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.501
(scoffs)

19:41.540 --> 19:42.734
David, you should
leave investigating

19:42.780 --> 19:44.509
to the professionals.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.370
You might hurt yourself.

19:46.410 --> 19:47.672
Okay! Save that photo,

19:47.720 --> 19:49.312
because it's the last time
you're gonna see

19:49.350 --> 19:50.942
the ethics committee
smiling in my presence.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.979
(laughter)
Thank you,
Governor-elect.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.385
Maybe we can
talk later.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.751
Notunﬁl
you call me "Peter."

19:58.930 --> 19:59.885
(door closes)

19:59.930 --> 20:02.558
We should replace her.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.669
Why?

20:03.700 --> 20:04.860
Because the optics
aren't good.

20:04.900 --> 20:05.719
What optics?

20:05.770 --> 20:06.919
Her... looks.

20:06.970 --> 20:09.291
Don't be
ridiculous, Eli.
I'm serious.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.705
I can't fire someone
because they're too pretty.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.707
Then don't.
Promote her.

20:11.740 --> 20:12.934
Move her laterally.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.279
You don't want sex
to be an issue here.

20:15.310 --> 20:16.277
It's not an issue.

20:16.310 --> 20:17.948
Not for you,
but for your enemies.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.538
They'd be delighted
to crown a new bimbo.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.514
She's not a bimbo.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.017
And we don't do that.

20:23.050 --> 20:25.541
We don't fire someone
because of the way they look.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.251
Okay?

20:27.290 --> 20:28.814
JOAN: _
It was my first execution.

20:28.860 --> 20:29.884
ALICIA:
In fact, you're not really

20:29.920 --> 20:33.026
a medically-trained nurse,
is that correct, Joan?

20:33.060 --> 20:33.924
Well, I have training...

20:33.960 --> 20:35.450
Yes, but due to
the Hippocratic oath,

20:35.500 --> 20:36.455
trained nurses
and doctors

20:36.500 --> 20:38.422
are not allowed to
partICIpate in executions.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.721
LENA: Attorney is testifying,
Your Honor.

20:39.770 --> 20:40.737
KLUGER:
Yes, at some length.

20:40.770 --> 20:41.691
Sustained.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.037
Joan, did you leave

20:43.070 --> 20:45.538
the execution prep in tears?

20:45.570 --> 20:46.605
Well, I was upset.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.937
Eddie said you
left in tears.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.878
Do you disagree
with that?

20:48.910 --> 20:49.899
No. He's right.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.042
He said it was because of

20:52.080 --> 20:55.846
the blood spilling from his neck
after a faulty IV line.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.381
JOAN:
That sounds right.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.411
I left because
of the blood.

21:02.890 --> 21:05.324
ALICIA:
Joan, did the prosecution
prepare you for this testimony

21:05.360 --> 21:07.794
by telling you to agree
with everything I said?

21:07.830 --> 21:08.819
Objection, Your Honor.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.361
KLUGER:
No, no. Overruled.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.594
Please answer.

21:11.630 --> 21:12.722
JOAN: She didn't say
"agree with everything,"

21:12.770 --> 21:15.830
but she did say you were trying
to create disagreement

21:15.870 --> 21:17.360
between Fornum and me

21:17.410 --> 21:18.832
so that Fornum would
have to be kept alive

21:18.870 --> 21:19.859
as a rebuttal witness.

21:19.910 --> 21:20.877
ALICIA:
So you are actively

21:20.910 --> 21:22.502
deceiving this court?
No.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.872
I'm just not seeing
any area of disagreement.

21:24.910 --> 21:25.877
ALICIA:
Do you believe Mr. Fornum

21:25.910 --> 21:27.912
was tortured?

21:30.350 --> 21:32.841
I think the offender
was in pain.

21:32.890 --> 21:36.519
He tried to keep from crying
and screaming out.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.925
I think...

21:37.960 --> 21:39.825
Yes, it was torture.

21:39.860 --> 21:42.727
And don't you think
this is a systematic problem

21:42.760 --> 21:44.091
of lethal injection?

21:44.130 --> 21:45.461
I don't think so.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.626
It was his veins.

21:46.670 --> 21:49.594
We've never had
this problem before.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.107
Eddie's veins?

21:51.140 --> 21:52.459
What do you mean?

21:52.510 --> 21:53.977
JOAN:
He has what we call

21:54.010 --> 21:55.807
rolling veins...
Objection!

21:55.840 --> 21:57.705
Your Honor,
we insist that a physical

21:57.750 --> 21:59.377
of Eddie Alan Fornum
be conducted.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.946
Oh, dear God. Your Honor...
The witness has made

22:00.980 --> 22:02.413
an assertion that Mr. Fornum is

22:02.450 --> 22:03.678
an exception
due to his rolling veins.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.915
Well, we need a physical to see
if he is in fact an exception.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.087
This is game-playing.

22:07.120 --> 22:07.950
I don't know
how it's game-playing...

22:07.990 --> 22:09.719
All the appeals
have all been exhausted.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.852
It's absolutely ridiculous.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.881
The only game-playing is...
KLUGER:
(whistles) Hey.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.898
I don't want to_shout
over you guys. Sit down.

22:14.930 --> 22:17.569
Sit down.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.897
Good.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.091
How long will it take
to do this physical?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.409
That was good.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.601
No, you were good.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.799
Okay.

22:32.850 --> 22:34.477
Kalinda, the court's
delayed a few days.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.817
Diane, yeah, we got
our reprieve.

22:35.850 --> 22:36.919
Yeah. _
Yes, I'm serious.

22:42.690 --> 22:45.124
ZACH: Are you serious?
BOY: Dude, totally serious.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.957
Stiles said he hooked up
with her after second period.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.491
(laughs)

22:48.530 --> 22:49.724
Hey, what's up with your sister?

22:49.760 --> 22:50.795
What do you mean?

22:50.830 --> 22:54.539
When did she start
looking so hot?

22:54.570 --> 22:55.832
What are you talking about?

22:55.870 --> 22:57.428
Oh, you probably haven't
seenit

22:57.470 --> 22:58.300
Seen what?

22:58.340 --> 23:00.808
Turbochap.com.
Stiles sent me the link.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.809
* Ooh, I'm not a baby no more

23:03.850 --> 23:08.719
* Ooh, I'm not a baby
no more *

23:08.750 --> 23:10.513
* I'm never far behind

23:10.550 --> 23:12.643
* When my daddy is corrupting
my mind *

23:12.690 --> 23:14.817
* I'm never far behind

23:14.860 --> 23:17.988
* When my daddy is corrupting
my mi-i-i... *

23:23.630 --> 23:25.769
* And I'm downright denim-clad

23:25.800 --> 23:27.893
* I pull a few
from every toothy fad *

23:27.940 --> 23:29.669
* And I can, and I won't

23:29.700 --> 23:31.634
* But I might

23:31.670 --> 23:34.673
* Ooh... I'm not a baby
no more *

23:34.710 --> 23:37.599
(phone ringing)
GRACE:
Are you gonna get that?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.845
* Ooh... I'm not a baby
no more *

23:39.880 --> 23:41.848
* I'm never far behind...

23:41.880 --> 23:42.812
Hello.

23:42.850 --> 23:45.739
ALICIA: Zach, it's Mom.
What are you doing?

23:45.790 --> 23:47.587
What am I doing?
Nothing. Homework. Why?

23:47.620 --> 23:48.587
Nothing, I just...

23:48.620 --> 23:50.679
I need you to get your sister
dinner tonight.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.550
Hey, is that Mom?

23:52.590 --> 23:53.921
Uh, yeah.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.428
Can you just tell her
we need more juice?

23:57.900 --> 23:59.663
We need more juice.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.894
And I love you, too.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.737
I'll be home around 11:00 or so.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.067
Not too much TV.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.168
Okay. Bye.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.802
Bye.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.829
CARY:
Alicia.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.639
What's going on?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.841
West Side Story?

24:12.880 --> 24:15.075
We have a possibility
on some office space.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.644
Just outside the Loop
on Harrison.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.648
$20 a square foot.
Good.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.714
It doesn't become available
for three weeks.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.980
Okay, so we rent temporary
offices in the meantime.

24:22.020 --> 24:22.987
CAREY:
No.

24:23.020 --> 24:24.681
We were, uh,
wondering whether

24:26.730 --> 24:27.890
For three weeks? Why?

24:27.930 --> 24:29.898
Chumhum needs some
work on a case.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.591
So, we do it
from our new office.

24:31.630 --> 24:32.722
(car alarm chirps)

24:32.770 --> 24:34.829
Look, we can't keep
skulking around.

24:34.870 --> 24:37.065
We have to cut the cord
at some pomt.
ROBYN:
I agree.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.829
We need to get going.
Tell her the real reason.

24:40.210 --> 24:42.007
People want to wait
for bonuses.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.576
Oh, come on!

24:43.610 --> 24:44.577
It's $1 million
between us.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.168
If we walk out before
the first of the month,

24:46.210 --> 24:47.177
they'll never pay us.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.575
A lot of us
are counting on

24:48.620 --> 24:49.712
that money for
start-up costs.

24:49.750 --> 24:50.717
We can't keep fooling
the partners.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.149
We can't keep fooling Will.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.857
Do we have a problem?

24:56.890 --> 24:59.984
No. But you were all right
waiting a week to leave

25:00.030 --> 25:01.725
after your case
was finished,

25:01.760 --> 25:04.524
but you're not all right
when it's our issue?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.867
It's a death row case.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.164
Okay, let's not make it
a big issue.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.533
Listen, the difference here
is two weeks.

25:11.570 --> 25:14.505
Let's just put it up to a vote
to the others, okay?

25:17.780 --> 25:19.145
(car alarm wailing)

25:25.850 --> 25:26.942
Hey, Tommy.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.185
Who are you?

25:29.220 --> 25:31.029
Kalinda.
Robyn.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.948
I don't know who you guys
are looking for.

25:32.990 --> 25:33.854
My name isn't Tommy.
It is.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.720
Tommy Diehause.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.297
Sad. You win
a whole new identity,

25:38.330 --> 25:39.991
but you still can't
resist being a thief.

25:40.030 --> 25:43.568
(sirens approaching)

25:43.610 --> 25:46.067
Look, I don't know
how you guys found me,

25:46.110 --> 25:48.305
but I told the truth
at Eddie's trial.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.329
He killed those girls.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.972
He was only trying
to jack their car,

25:51.010 --> 25:52.978
but they fought him and
pulled off his ski mask,

25:53.010 --> 25:54.841
and that's why he had
to kill them.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.916
Come on, Tommy, why would
anyone confess to you?

25:56.950 --> 25:58.838
You have snitch
written all over you.
Yeah.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.756
But how'd I know
about the ski mask

26:02.790 --> 26:04.189
if Eddie
didn't tell me, huh?

26:04.230 --> 26:07.893
The police never told
anyone about that little detail.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.295
Maybe you heard it
from the real killer.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.968
I did hear it
from the real killer:

26:11.000 --> 26:14.060
your client.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.135
Alicia, Alicia.

26:15.170 --> 26:16.660
Kalinda found
the snitch,

26:16.700 --> 26:18.065
but he's sticking
to his story.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.702
Damn.
Does she believe him?

26:19.740 --> 26:21.139
No. She thinks
there might be

26:21.180 --> 26:22.977
another way to
get him, though.

26:23.010 --> 26:25.001
Are you okay?

26:25.050 --> 26:28.144
The parking garage meet?

26:28.180 --> 26:29.875
Sure. We're fine.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.387
MONICA:
Hello?

26:31.420 --> 26:32.944
Can someone help me, please?

26:32.990 --> 26:34.582
I can't see anything.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.229
(door b
an
Oh! gs)

26:38.260 --> 26:40.990
Is anyone around?

26:41.030 --> 26:42.054
Thank you.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.055
WILL:
Alicia.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.624
Do you have a minute?

26:44.670 --> 26:45.762
Sure.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.638
What's wrong?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.409
DAVID: We looked into
the company's phones.

27:01.450 --> 27:02.815
Over the past month,

27:02.850 --> 27:03.885
the fourth-year associates
have called

27:03.920 --> 27:05.785
our top clients
a dozen times each.

27:05.820 --> 27:07.879
DIANE: We're worried they're
thinking of leaving with them.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.353
Do you have
any insight?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.992
No.

27:14.030 --> 27:16.919
We called the clients, but
they're being tight-lipped,

27:16.960 --> 27:19.269
said they have no plans of
leaving at the present time.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.188
DAVID: Which is known as
"preservmg their options."

27:21.240 --> 27:23.037
I say we move
past metadata

27:23.070 --> 27:23.968
and access their texts.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.102
Can we do that?

27:25.140 --> 27:26.232
Where's Kalinda?

27:26.270 --> 27:28.238
DAVID: Kalinda's
sympathetic with them.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.840
Yes, we can do that.
They're our phones.

27:30.880 --> 27:31.949
We own the texts.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.379
WILL: Alicia, you're
friends with Cary.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.048
Are you hearing anything at all?

27:35.080 --> 27:38.686
No. Not since the fourth-years
tried to scare us.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.347
It would be helpful if you
could get closer to them.

27:40.390 --> 27:41.186
WILL:
Find out if they're happy,

27:41.220 --> 27:43.359
and whether
we should be worried.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.025
Sure.

28:00.170 --> 28:02.138
KLUGER:
Okay, here's my problem:

28:02.180 --> 28:05.445
I have two medical
reports conducted by

28:05.480 --> 28:07.107
two different doctors--

28:07.150 --> 28:09.311
one for the plaintiff,
one for the defense--

28:09.350 --> 28:11.238
and surprisingly, they
tell two different stories.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.246
Your Honor,
may I suggest...

28:13.290 --> 28:15.417
That Mr. Fornum be preserved
as a rebuttal witness?

28:15.460 --> 28:17.724
LENA:
Your Honor, we withdraw

28:17.760 --> 28:19.921
our medical report on the
offender's physical condition

28:19.960 --> 28:22.121
and stipulate to the truth
of the plaintiff's report.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.728
Excuse me?

28:25.770 --> 28:27.067
In addition, we stipulate

28:27.100 --> 28:29.034
to everything testified in
Mr. Fornum's deposition.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.367
So let me get
this straight.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.731
You've decided that
it's better to execute

28:31.770 --> 28:33.738
Mr._ Fornum than
to Win your lawswt?

28:33.780 --> 28:34.974
We also have the warden

28:35.010 --> 28:36.375
from the Indiana State Prison

28:36.410 --> 28:37.968
who will swear to changes

28:38.010 --> 28:40.478
in the lethal injection protocol
so at to reduce the pain

28:40.510 --> 28:41.477
associated therewith.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.316
I imagine, Mr. Gardner,

28:42.350 --> 28:44.739
you would like to depose
said warden?

28:44.790 --> 28:46.348
Definitely, Your Honor.
Either way,

28:46.390 --> 28:48.415
there's no reason to delay
this execution anymore.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.429
If you so stipulate,
I suppose that's true.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.189
(gavelbangs)

28:56.060 --> 28:58.164
ROBYN:
Ms. Lockhart?

28:59.500 --> 29:01.092
Eddie didn't do it.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.095
I agree.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.937
How do we prove it?

29:03.970 --> 29:05.835
The snitch testified
about the ski mask,

29:05.870 --> 29:08.270
something he could only know
from the killer, right?

29:08.310 --> 29:10.847
But when I was at Treasury,
we looked into prison brokers.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.279
Prison. . .?
Brokers.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.278
They're police insiders who sell
information to prisoners

29:14.320 --> 29:17.016
so that they can snitch
on their cell mates in exchange

29:17.050 --> 29:18.278
for a lighter sentence.

29:18.320 --> 29:23.110
You think Diehause got the ski
mask information from a broker?

29:23.160 --> 29:25.025
I don't know. Maybe.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.322
But he'll just deny it.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.497
If we go to him.

29:29.530 --> 29:32.021
But what if we go
after the broker?

29:34.400 --> 29:38.109
Tommy Diehause snitched
for our office three times.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.233
So we want to find someone
on all three cases.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.272
Yeah, like a police officer,
forensic investigator.

29:42.310 --> 29:43.902
Good luck.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.271
You're not gonna help us?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.821
(talking quietly)

30:02.230 --> 30:04.027
Yeah.

30:07.230 --> 30:09.892
MAN:
Sir?

30:11.940 --> 30:14.374
Why do you think Alicia's
leaving Lockhart/Gardner?

30:14.410 --> 30:15.434
Why do I think?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.300
Because she wants
to make something of herself.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.500
Not about Will?

30:21.480 --> 30:23.914
Well, I-I wouldn't presume.

30:23.950 --> 30:26.919
And, uh...

30:26.950 --> 30:29.555
you think the optics are wrong
with Marilyn?

30:29.590 --> 30:32.081
Yes.

30:32.130 --> 30:36.191
Photos of you with her
would give the wrong impression.

30:36.230 --> 30:38.164
Okay.

30:40.170 --> 30:42.035
Promote her.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.164
No. No cops in common,

30:45.210 --> 30:46.234
_ no forensic _
investigators, nothing.

30:46.270 --> 30:48.602
We're still looking.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.902
(sighs)

30:49.940 --> 30:51.271
Okay.

30:51.310 --> 30:54.040
The execution is on
for tonight.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.885
Who typed up
your crime report?

30:57.920 --> 31:00.241
What?

31:00.290 --> 31:03.555
Who was_ the clerk
on your crime report?

31:03.590 --> 31:06.252
Bottom of the page, there.

31:16.070 --> 31:18.334
The typist.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.368
Thank you, so much,
Ms. Munn,

31:24.410 --> 31:26.071
for coming in on
such short notice.

31:26.110 --> 31:28.271
Oh, no problem, but I'm-I'm
not sure how I can help.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.548
I just type.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.286
I don't actually catch
the bad guys.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.584
Actually, uh, we
want to help you.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.087
Really? How do you want
to do that?

31:35.120 --> 31:37.384
We want to keep
you out of jail.

31:37.420 --> 31:40.127
We discovered your brother
works as a prison guard,

31:40.160 --> 31:42.094
and that's how you sell
information to snitches.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.459
We are meeting next
with Tommy Diehause,

31:47.500 --> 31:49.934
and one of you is gonna
turn on the other.

31:49.970 --> 31:52.302
That's the problem
with working with

31:52.340 --> 31:54.433
a snitch, Ms. Munn:
they like to snitch.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.039
So I would start talking first.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.502
(knocking)

32:00.550 --> 32:02.211
What do you want?

32:02.250 --> 32:04.514
ZACH: Did Stiles talk to
you yesterday at school?

32:04.550 --> 32:06.518
What? Drew Stiles?

32:06.550 --> 32:07.642
Yeah. Why?

32:07.690 --> 32:09.988
What'd he say?

32:10.020 --> 32:12.488
Nothing. He's disgusting.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.588
I know. What'd he say?

32:13.630 --> 32:15.450
Did you say something
to your friends?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.127
No. Why?

32:17.160 --> 32:19.492
They're all trying
to talk to me now.

32:23.740 --> 32:26.004
What are you doing?

32:34.150 --> 32:36.414
What is this?

32:46.130 --> 32:49.122
ALICIA: Kids, hurry up!
Your ride's here!

32:51.330 --> 32:52.627
(knocking)

32:54.540 --> 32:57.293
Can we talk?

32:57.340 --> 32:59.558
Uh, my mistake.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.339
I have to get to work.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.302
You were in with the
partners yesterday.

33:03.340 --> 33:05.069
What did they say?

33:05.110 --> 33:06.099
Nothing.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.346
Alicia.

33:09.380 --> 33:10.677
(door closes)

33:10.720 --> 33:13.041
We need to leave
by the end of the week.

33:13.090 --> 33:15.058
They said that?
No, I'm saying it.

33:15.090 --> 33:16.250
I'm still a partner here.

33:16.290 --> 33:18.178
And I'm stuck in the middle.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.788
I have a fiduciary
responsibility

33:19.830 --> 33:20.626
to Lockhart/Gardner.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.049
And I am opening myself up
to a lawsuit

33:23.100 --> 33:24.727
just by talking
to you about anything.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.567
We need to leave.
Look.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.137
One of the things
we said we didn't like

33:29.170 --> 33:31.138
about Lockhart/Gardner was
how decisions were made

33:31.170 --> 33:33.206
by fiat: by
Will and Diane.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.209
We said we wanted to run
things democratically.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.049
And we all voted
to wait three weeks.

33:39.110 --> 33:40.805
Would we take this case?

33:40.850 --> 33:42.477
This death row case.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.771
I don't know.

33:43.820 --> 33:44.787
Probably. Why not?

33:44.820 --> 33:45.809
It's pro bono.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.738
50 partner hours.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.655
We would be afraid
of going broke.

33:49.690 --> 33:50.657
Yeah, but
Lockhart/Gardner

33:50.690 --> 33:52.453
didn't take
death row cases

33:52.490 --> 33:54.526
until its sixth
or seventh year.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.339
Are you having
second thoughts?

34:01.370 --> 34:04.430
I don't know.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.439
I like watching
Diane and Will work.

34:09.180 --> 34:10.772
They care.
Alicia.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.244
You and I are
the new Will and Diane.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.488
Don't use the company phones.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.181
They're accessing the data.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.629
I have a deposition.

34:26.990 --> 34:29.788
BARKIN: Very simply, the medical
team thought they could put

34:29.830 --> 34:32.526
an IV in the offender's
arm, but they were wrong.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.095
And how will tonight's
execution be different?

34:35.140 --> 34:36.869
We will do a better job
hydrating Mr. Fornum

34:36.900 --> 34:39.164
and using warm compresses
to raise his veins.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.531
And we will place
the I.V. in his foot.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.332
And you didn't do this
the last time?

34:43.380 --> 34:44.506
We would've.

34:44.550 --> 34:45.847
But the execution
was halted.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.575
And I didn't
superwse it.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.510
So, you weren't present
during the last attempt?

34:49.550 --> 34:51.188
Not all the time.

34:51.220 --> 34:53.643
We had a late arrival
of potassium chloride.

34:53.690 --> 34:56.579
We've had difficulties with the
supply of this drug in the past,

34:56.620 --> 34:59.384
so I supervised and
witnessed its removal

34:59.430 --> 35:01.159
from an overnight
pouch and placement

35:01.200 --> 35:02.098
in the intravenous tubing.

35:02.130 --> 35:03.859
However, we will have
greater control...

35:03.900 --> 35:06.164
(whispers):
What?

35:06.200 --> 35:07.622
I've ordered
the staff...

35:07.670 --> 35:10.491
This court seems to be all
Eddie Alan Fornum all the time.

35:10.540 --> 35:11.700
DIANE:
Yes, His Honor Manfreddi

35:11.740 --> 35:15.471
referred this death row appeal
to your court, Your Honor,

35:15.510 --> 35:17.239
um...

35:17.280 --> 35:19.339
given that you were
already hearing

35:19.380 --> 35:20.540
the Eighth Amendment appeal.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.241
Luclq me. All right.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.248
So you're ten hours away
from an execution.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.484
What do you got for me?

35:27.690 --> 35:29.851
We'd like to call a witness.

35:31.260 --> 35:34.252
DIANE: You testified at
Edward Alan Fornum's trial?

35:34.300 --> 35:35.289
Yes.

35:35.330 --> 35:36.558
And you testified

35:36.600 --> 35:38.659
that he confessed to
the double murder?

35:38.700 --> 35:39.792
Yes.

35:39.830 --> 35:41.331
And you would
like to now

35:41.370 --> 35:42.439
withdraw that testimony?

35:43.770 --> 35:45.328
Yes.
As far as you know,

35:45.370 --> 35:47.907
Eddie Fornum is innocent?

35:47.940 --> 35:49.737
Yes.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.577
And you received the information
to condemn him

35:51.610 --> 35:53.339
from the brother of

35:53.380 --> 35:55.575
that woman there--
Leslie Munn?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.212
Yes.
Is there anything else

35:57.250 --> 35:59.343
you would like to say?

36:01.260 --> 36:03.512
No.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.394
You know, I didn't plan
on judging this appeal,

36:08.430 --> 36:11.297
but you bring me that snitch
who changes his testimony

36:11.330 --> 36:14.538
after almost a decade?

36:14.570 --> 36:16.265
Now... (sighs)
now I'm sorry,

36:16.300 --> 36:17.460
Ms. Lockhart, I'm sorry,

36:17.500 --> 36:21.334
but, uh, an appeal
of actual innocence

36:21.380 --> 36:23.234
after years
of appeals and decisions

36:23.280 --> 36:26.204
and-and delays has to stand on

36:26.250 --> 36:28.969
much more ground than
an indecisive snitch.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.214
Your Honor...
No.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.410
At a certain point,

36:31.450 --> 36:35.352
it has to be over,
judgments must stand.

36:35.390 --> 36:36.755
God forgive me...

36:36.790 --> 36:38.678
I find for the state.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.618
Execution will proceed.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.651
(gavelbangs)

36:45.300 --> 36:48.565
GUARD:
Eddie, I need you to stand.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.802
Eddie, please.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.814
Place your hands
out in front of you.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.351
Turn around, please.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.301
You know the way, Eddie.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.414
You wanted to see me, Mr. Gold?

37:37.450 --> 37:38.747
Oh, yes. Hi, Marilyn.

37:38.790 --> 37:39.848
How are you?
Good.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.279
I think we're off to a great
start, don't you think?

37:42.320 --> 37:43.014
I do, I do.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.028
And I have some good news.

37:45.060 --> 37:48.518
Peter wants to promote you
to the Transit Authority...

37:48.560 --> 37:49.720
Board.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.398
I...

37:51.430 --> 37:52.465
I'm sorry, what?

37:52.500 --> 37:54.559
Yes, uh, an opening has

37:54.600 --> 37:57.660
opened up
on the Transit Authority Board,

37:57.700 --> 38:01.409
uh, where you will have
authority... over transit.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.298
Congratulations.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.806
Did I do something wrong?

38:05.850 --> 38:07.772
No, you did something right.

38:07.810 --> 38:09.778
It's a promotion.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.546
No, Marilyn.

38:13.590 --> 38:14.989
Peter promoted you.

38:15.020 --> 38:17.818
If he'd wanted to tell you
that himself, he would have.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.390
You guys are
making a mistake.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.318
Maybe.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.998
You have a good evening.

38:29.070 --> 38:31.095
(door closes)

38:31.140 --> 38:32.459
How did it go?

38:32.510 --> 38:33.761
Well.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.732
She took it like a pro.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.578
She's right, you know, we
need a new chief of staff.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.043
She's not right, she's anal.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.049
Well, anal's what
we need right now.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.718
Did I just say that?

38:44.750 --> 38:45.842
Yes.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.346
Our new state motto?

38:47.390 --> 38:48.709
(laughs)

38:48.760 --> 38:50.409
I'll make up a list.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.849
Why don't you do it?

38:52.890 --> 38:55.120
What? Be chief of staff?

38:55.160 --> 38:56.388
(laughs)

38:56.430 --> 38:58.569
But I...

38:58.600 --> 39:00.989
I'm working on
your next campaign, sir.

39:01.030 --> 39:03.965
My next campaign is
here in this office.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.400
I screw that up, there's
nowhere to go but down.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.745
You going tonight?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.781
No.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.025
We did everything
we could.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.051
Not everything.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.853
(metal clinking)

40:02.830 --> 40:04.821
(footsteps approaching)

40:09.240 --> 40:12.209
We want to put an I.V.
in early, Eddie,

40:12.240 --> 40:16.028
so there isn't the same
confu5ion at midnight.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.105
Tell us if you
feel any pain.

40:18.140 --> 40:19.175
You should feel

40:19.210 --> 40:21.440
a small pinprick as we attempt

40:21.480 --> 40:24.711
to put in the I.V.

40:24.750 --> 40:27.082
The monitor you see
above your ankle

40:27.120 --> 40:28.144
is a VeinMapper.

40:28.190 --> 40:31.819
It uses ultraviolet imaging
to help find veins.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.928
(groans softly)
Okay, the pain should be
over in a minute, Eddie.

40:42.970 --> 40:43.937
(door opens)

40:43.970 --> 40:46.939
Warden, excuse me.

40:46.970 --> 40:49.006
What?
There's somebody
out here for you.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.639
(sighs)

40:53.650 --> 40:55.948
I'll be right back
with you, Eddie.

40:59.550 --> 41:00.812
Excuse me.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.488
We're in the midst
of a protocol. What is it?

41:02.520 --> 41:03.680
Yes, our apologies, sir.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.052
My name is Agent Lionel Franklin
from the South Bend office

41:06.090 --> 41:08.058
of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.092
It's come to our attention
that you've transported

41:10.130 --> 41:12.462
toxic chemicals
through the US. Postal Service.

41:14.270 --> 41:15.737
Are you serious?

41:15.770 --> 41:19.206
It's a direct violation
of 49 U.S.C. 5101.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.572
Have you transported
any such chemicals?

41:21.610 --> 41:23.999
BARKIN: We use potassium
chloride in our L.I. protocol,

41:24.040 --> 41:25.940
and, yes, we transferred it
by overnight post.

41:25.980 --> 41:28.642
FRANKLIN: I'm gonna have to
confiscate those chemicals.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.841
*

41:44.700 --> 41:48.534
The governor has put
the execution on hold, Eddie.

41:48.570 --> 41:50.891
They don't want
to try a third time.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.901
It's over, Eddie.

41:59.180 --> 42:01.239
Thank you. Thank you.

42:04.620 --> 42:06.918
* With eyes open

42:06.950 --> 42:10.317
* I was having a dream

42:10.360 --> 42:14.854
* And as real as it seemed...

42:14.900 --> 42:16.697
Good work.

42:16.730 --> 42:18.152
ALICIA:
Thanks.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.623
Were you the one
who called the DEA?

42:20.670 --> 42:22.991
Now, what would
make you think that?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.132
It was a smart move.

42:24.170 --> 42:25.307
Have some?

42:25.340 --> 42:27.729
* I remember your face...

42:29.210 --> 42:30.575
Will?

42:32.850 --> 42:35.045
I need to tell you something.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.342
No, you don't, Alicia.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.917
Look, I know why
you didn't call, and it's okay.

42:38.950 --> 42:41.680
We were on a merry-go-round
and we needed to get off,

42:41.720 --> 42:43.187
so we're off.

42:48.630 --> 42:49.699
Don't end up hating me.

42:49.730 --> 42:52.290
What?

42:53.330 --> 42:56.094
Nothing. Have a good night.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.096
Are you sure you
don't want some?

42:58.140 --> 42:59.266
(laughs)

42:59.310 --> 43:00.334
No, I'm good.

43:07.380 --> 43:09.575
(Will and Diane
laughing, chattering)
