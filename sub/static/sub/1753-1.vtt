01:00.561 --> 01:03.479
Five, four, three...

01:03.647 --> 01:06.274
...two, one.

01:06.442 --> 01:07.900
Ready or not, here I come.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.602
Hey, Dad?

02:26.063 --> 02:27.814
Dad!

03:31.044 --> 03:32.169
You'll stay with Aunt May...

03:32.337 --> 03:34.130
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.465
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.972
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

03:43.140 --> 03:45.391
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.685
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.399
Dad.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.943
Be good.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.545
Sorry.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.547
Morning, Flash.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.594
Good morning, Parker.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.936
Hey. It's Peter, right?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.189
I really like your photos.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.982
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.108
Listen...

04:36.276 --> 04:37.610
...are you busy Friday night?

04:43.158 --> 04:46.118
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.287
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

04:48.455 --> 04:49.538
...for his birthday.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.792
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.294
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

04:55.462 --> 04:57.213
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.507
Parker.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.717
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

05:01.885 --> 05:03.386
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.887
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.180
Like that?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.057
- That's it.
- Okay.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.584
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

05:35.752 --> 05:37.128
Eat it! Eat it!

05:37.295 --> 05:39.839
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

05:40.007 --> 05:42.425
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

05:42.592 --> 05:44.051
Come on!

05:44.219 --> 05:45.386
Hey, Parker, come on.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.929
Get a picture of this.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.266
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.393
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.602
Take the picture.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.229
Put him down, Flash.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.981
Take the picture.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.734
Put him down, Eugene!

06:02.779 --> 06:04.113
Hey, man.

06:05.949 --> 06:06.615
Come on!

06:06.783 --> 06:07.450
Get up, Parker!

06:10.203 --> 06:10.870
Get up!

06:11.038 --> 06:12.663
Come on! Come on!

06:12.831 --> 06:13.497
Get up!

06:16.460 --> 06:17.793
Still not taking the picture.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.628
Stay down, Parker!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.630
Who wants one more?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.382
- One more!
- Flash!

06:23.884 --> 06:25.259
Flash...

06:25.427 --> 06:27.303
...we still on for after school today?

06:27.471 --> 06:28.596
My house, 3:30?

06:28.764 --> 06:29.972
I hope you did homework.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.640
Last time, I was...

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
...disappointed in you.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.686
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.063
How about it?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.442
Whatever.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.427
I thought that was great
what you did.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.429
It was stupid...

07:11.223 --> 07:12.181
...but it was great.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.058
You should go to...

07:14.226 --> 07:15.976
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.021
What's your name?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.689
You don't know my name?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.858
No, I know your name.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.735
I want to know
if you know your name.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.030
Peter.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.283
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.543
I'd still go to the nurse though.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.961
You're Gwen, right?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.337
Gwen Stacy.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.339
All right.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.259
Hey.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.343
I'm making...

07:49.511 --> 07:51.220
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.056
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.935
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

07:58.395 --> 08:00.146
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
What happened to your face?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.400
I'm all right. Just... I fell, skating.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.152
It's all right.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.863
Ben Parker, don't you even...

08:09.030 --> 08:11.991
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.200
My bowling trophies.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.910
Oh, well, then, by all means...

08:15.078 --> 08:16.579
...leave that box in my kitchen.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.205
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.373
Why you kids...

08:19.541 --> 08:21.167
...ride those things, I'll never know.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.918
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.712
Remember when we were stupid?

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
No.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.174
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.258
Where's the flood?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.926
Follow me. I'll show you.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.303
- You serious?
- Yes.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.096
All right.

08:36.057 --> 08:36.932
It's the condenser tray.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.686
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.770
This has got to be the fill line.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.316
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.817
Can you fix it?

08:47.402 --> 08:50.237
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.823
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.535
How's the other guy look?

08:58.121 --> 09:01.248
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.211
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

09:05.754 --> 09:06.670
No, no.

09:06.838 --> 09:07.922
All right.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.174
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.636
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.889
Before you come up, see if...

09:17.057 --> 09:19.475
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.619
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.371
They fix pipes and pump things.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.373
If you ask them to...

09:46.670 --> 09:49.338
I forgot all about that thing.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.381
It was your dad's.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.383
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.807
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.644
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

10:04.062 --> 10:05.604
And guess who sold it to him.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.439
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.691
That's how they met.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.651
He asked you to...

10:10.819 --> 10:12.778
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.697
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.991
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.660
Yeah, I know.

10:25.709 --> 10:26.667
Who's that?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.377
Do you know who that is?

10:28.545 --> 10:29.878
Some guy who worked with...

10:30.046 --> 10:31.171
...your dad, I guess.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.970
Just take this off the table, all right?

10:38.138 --> 10:41.181
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.225
- Now.
- All right.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.393
Go on.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.638
I need you to be a good boy.

11:21.806 --> 11:22.931
Where are you going?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.266
There's something...

11:24.434 --> 11:26.435
...your mom and I have to do.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.827
What is this?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.957
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

12:32.627 --> 12:34.378
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.179
Come in.

12:44.848 --> 12:45.681
You okay?

12:45.849 --> 12:48.183
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.643
You look just like him.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.604
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.944
Listen...

12:59.112 --> 13:00.571
...I don't have much education.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.197
You know that, Peter.

13:02.657 --> 13:06.034
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.787
What I'm trying to say is...

13:09.330 --> 13:11.707
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.042
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.128
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

13:16.296 --> 13:17.671
...all right.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.341
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.595
Curt Connors.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.015
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.517
They worked together for years
and they were close.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.061
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.189
He never even called.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.565
Not once.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.694
Go figure.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.282
She's pretty.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.747
Uncle Ben.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.165
What?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.250
You're a pretty great dad.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.599
Excuse me.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.559
What?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.310
Can I help you?

14:55.478 --> 14:57.145
I don't know. I'm here to see...

14:57.313 --> 14:58.772
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.816
You'll find yourself to the left.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.403
You are here for the internship?

15:05.363 --> 15:06.655
Yeah. Yeah.

15:06.823 --> 15:07.906
Okay.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.950
You'll find your badge to the left.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.832
Having trouble finding yourself?

15:17.584 --> 15:18.500
No. Yeah, I got it.

15:21.087 --> 15:21.837
Okay...

15:22.005 --> 15:23.880
...Mr. Guevara.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.136
Welcome to Oscorp.

15:29.304 --> 15:32.139
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...

15:32.307 --> 15:35.976
...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.

15:37.103 --> 15:41.148
Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defence, biomedical...

15:41.316 --> 15:44.109
...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.569
Welcome to Oscorp.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.029
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

15:47.196 --> 15:48.071
...at Midtown Science...

15:48.239 --> 15:49.656
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.992
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.827
Where I go, you go.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.704
That's the rule. Remember that...

15:55.872 --> 15:57.331
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

15:57.498 --> 15:58.874
- If you forget that...
- Listen!

15:59.042 --> 15:59.958
Look, listen.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.710
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.961
Just tell them...

16:03.129 --> 16:04.171
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

16:04.339 --> 16:05.505
My name's Rodrigo!

16:05.673 --> 16:08.508
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.052
Shall we?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.686
Come around this way.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.067
Good afternoon, Gwen.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.193
Dr. Connors.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.111
Welcome.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.073
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.492
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.910
I'm not a cripple...

16:35.078 --> 16:38.413
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.333
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.959
Like the Parkinson's patient...

16:43.127 --> 16:45.837
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

16:46.005 --> 16:49.424
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

16:49.592 --> 16:53.428
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

16:53.596 --> 16:57.432
I want to create a world
without weakness.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.560
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

17:01.062 --> 17:01.937
Yes.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.063
Stem cells?

17:03.231 --> 17:04.815
Promising. But the solution...

17:04.982 --> 17:07.776
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.613
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.080
Person gets Parkinson's...

17:21.249 --> 17:23.625
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

17:23.792 --> 17:25.794
...start to disappear.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.628
But a zebra fish has the ability...

17:27.797 --> 17:30.006
...to regenerate cells on command.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.092
If you could give this ability...

17:32.260 --> 17:35.137
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

17:36.180 --> 17:37.514
She's curing herself.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.559
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.313
And you are?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.359
He's one of Midtown Science's...

17:49.527 --> 17:51.027
...best and brightest.
- Really?

17:51.195 --> 17:52.195
Second in his class.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.157
- Second?
- Yeah.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.158
Sure about that?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.784
I'm pretty sure.

18:01.289 --> 18:05.167
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.210
Nice meeting you all.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.840
If you'd like to gather round.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.009
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.596
Our planet's tree of life is immense.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.306
At Oscorp's...

18:19.474 --> 18:21.183
...Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.352
...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...

18:25.772 --> 18:26.980
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

18:30.067 --> 18:31.276
Oh, yeah.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.694
What are you doing here?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.029
I work here. I don't.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.781
I was gonna say I work here...

18:35.948 --> 18:39.159
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.202
You following me?

18:40.369 --> 18:43.497
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.873
Why would you be here?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.875
I just snuck in because...

18:47.043 --> 18:48.460
I love science.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.420
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.214
So you snuck in...?

18:52.381 --> 18:54.549
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.636
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.055
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

19:00.723 --> 19:04.184
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.481
Sorry. Yo.

19:10.900 --> 19:11.983
Sorry.

21:35.378 --> 21:39.005
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.967
They were disappointing.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.890
Define "disappointing."

21:49.058 --> 21:50.392
Another dead end.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.227
It's the decay rate algorithm.

21:52.687 --> 21:54.896
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

21:55.064 --> 21:56.398
You said you were close.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.733
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.110
He doesn't have time.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.570
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.322
Save him.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.535
Or we'll both lose our heads.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.388
All right, give me the badge.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.933
Give it to me.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.980
Sorry.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.251
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.004
I didn't mean to do that.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.589
I didn't mean to...

23:44.757 --> 23:46.508
I didn't... I didn't...

23:47.843 --> 23:49.010
Get your hand off her!

23:49.178 --> 23:50.845
I'm trying to get my...

23:54.517 --> 23:55.433
Are you kidding?

23:55.601 --> 23:56.392
I'm sorry.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.769
Are you kidding me?

23:58.354 --> 24:00.063
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

24:03.359 --> 24:04.526
Man, I'm sorry!

24:04.693 --> 24:05.777
Man, are you all right?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.240
- Take him down!
- Come on.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.452
Get him, man! Get him!

24:17.248 --> 24:18.498
No, man, no. Not my board.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.958
Please, dude, don't...

24:21.877 --> 24:22.961
Sorry!

24:25.756 --> 24:27.924
Sorry. Sorry.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.384
I'm so sorry.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.890
Coney Island, next stop.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.017
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

24:50.030 --> 24:50.697
Hey.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.199
Hey. Hey.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.576
Sorry. I'm late.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.411
- I got...
- We've been so worried.

24:56.579 --> 24:57.704
I know. I'm sorry.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.205
Watch out!

25:06.255 --> 25:07.463
That's a fly, Peter.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.178
Yeah.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.642
I'm so sorry...

25:19.810 --> 25:20.977
...I kept you guys up.

25:21.145 --> 25:24.480
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

25:25.024 --> 25:26.441
...and I'm hungry.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.530
Meat loaf.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.284
Drinking?

25:36.452 --> 25:37.493
What's this?

25:37.661 --> 25:39.037
I don't think so.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.872
This is your meat loaf.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.126
This beats all other meat loafs.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.421
Something is very wrong.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.089
Yeah.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.300
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.974
I got it.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.813
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.815
I noticed that.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.611
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

26:11.862 --> 26:14.072
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.908
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

29:08.080 --> 29:08.830
Peter.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.332
What are you doing?

29:11.500 --> 29:13.000
I'm...

29:14.128 --> 29:15.086
Homework.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.796
Be careful.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.548
Sure.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.183
Dr. Connors.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.687
You don't remember me. I...

29:32.855 --> 29:34.105
The intern from the other day.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.357
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.818
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.320
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.864
I'm Richard Parker's son.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.330
Peter?

29:53.959 --> 29:54.625
I'm afraid...

29:54.793 --> 29:58.087
...I can't help you much. I don't
know why they left or where they...

29:58.255 --> 29:59.005
...were going.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.259
Good reflexes.

30:03.427 --> 30:04.802
Thank you.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.893
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.519
Yeah.

30:13.687 --> 30:14.854
It's something, you know.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.814
So you really think...

30:16.982 --> 30:19.692
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.320
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.239
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.533
They called us mad scientists.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.037
And then your father
bred the spiders...

30:31.205 --> 30:32.580
...and everything changed.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.415
The results were
beyond encouraging.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.542
They were spectacular.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.672
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.799
Including my own.

30:44.301 --> 30:45.885
Then it was over.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.680
He was gone.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.350
Took his research with him.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.020
And I knew without him, I...

31:03.445 --> 31:05.196
I...

31:06.782 --> 31:08.950
I was angry.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.204
So I stayed away from you...

31:13.372 --> 31:15.289
...and your family.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.375
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.385
Say...

31:28.011 --> 31:29.136
Say it worked.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.472
Say you got it to work.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.935
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

31:36.812 --> 31:38.980
What could the side effects be?

31:42.609 --> 31:45.778
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.572
The problem was always...

31:47.739 --> 31:49.156
The decay rate algorithm?

31:52.077 --> 31:53.619
- Right.
- Right.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.163
Can I?

31:56.331 --> 31:57.999
Of course.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.856
Extraordinary.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.317
How did you come up with this?

32:31.074 --> 32:33.618
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

32:33.785 --> 32:35.703
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.665
Thank you.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.312
Number one, Reggie.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.396
Run it, buddy.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.106
Let's go, Reggie.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.277
Rejected!

33:10.947 --> 33:12.657
You did that on purpose, Flash!

33:12.824 --> 33:14.909
I should've.
You better watch your back.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.539
Hey.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.376
All right?

33:30.133 --> 33:30.925
Give it up.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.515
Come on, man.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.434
One sec.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.232
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

33:50.445 --> 33:51.654
That's right. Take it.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.447
Go ahead. Take it.

34:14.428 --> 34:15.261
Just take it.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.806
All right, how about this?

34:20.641 --> 34:21.641
All right?

34:21.810 --> 34:22.726
How about that?

34:26.982 --> 34:29.108
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.402
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.902
Yo, Flash, let's go.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.572
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.489
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.324
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

34:40.078 --> 34:40.870
What you doing?

34:43.873 --> 34:46.000
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

34:59.514 --> 35:01.182
Peter's behaviour is just...

35:01.349 --> 35:02.141
...unacceptable.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.184
They won't make us pay...

35:03.351 --> 35:06.187
...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.063
- Was that true?
- What?

35:08.231 --> 35:10.024
What I heard in there just now.

35:10.192 --> 35:13.152
Did you humiliate that boy?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.196
Yeah, I did.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.364
- But...
- But what?

35:17.532 --> 35:18.991
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

35:19.159 --> 35:20.868
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

35:23.205 --> 35:24.455
Is he?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.457
Yeah, yeah, but...

35:26.625 --> 35:28.709
So all this is about getting even.

35:29.211 --> 35:32.713
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

35:32.881 --> 35:33.881
Am I right or wrong?

35:35.884 --> 35:37.468
Yeah, I thought so.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.429
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

35:40.597 --> 35:42.556
...I had to change shifts at work...

35:42.724 --> 35:46.393
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

35:46.937 --> 35:48.354
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.231
Okay, good.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.692
She looks familiar.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.696
The girl on your computer.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.532
Yeah.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.660
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.079
Don't forget Aunt May.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.584
Okay.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.173
He's a character.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.341
That's my uncle.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.552
He's a pathological liar.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.095
He thought you were someone else.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.764
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

36:23.932 --> 36:27.059
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.936
- Right.
- So...

36:29.104 --> 36:31.438
...he must have seen...
I was touching up stuff.

36:32.274 --> 36:33.774
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.610
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.198
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.576
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.832
So you want to... I don't know?

36:51.334 --> 36:52.126
Want to what?

36:52.794 --> 36:54.003
I don't know.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.880
Just...

37:01.136 --> 37:03.596
I don't know... We could...

37:04.639 --> 37:06.557
We could do something else,
or we could...

37:06.725 --> 37:09.184
- If you don't feel like, we could...
- Yeah.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.895
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.440
- Really?
- Sure.

37:15.317 --> 37:16.150
Okay.

37:16.318 --> 37:17.651
All right, good. Sounds good.

37:17.819 --> 37:18.777
Cool.

37:19.321 --> 37:20.821
Okay.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.324
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.659
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.831
But maybe...

37:30.999 --> 37:33.167
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

37:33.335 --> 37:35.002
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.837
- Bye.
- All right.

39:04.801 --> 39:07.469
We have protein structure, rDNA...

39:07.637 --> 39:09.722
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

39:09.889 --> 39:13.142
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

39:13.601 --> 39:16.103
- Human line testing over...
- I remember that.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.938
I've seen that before.

39:18.106 --> 39:19.398
The Ganali device.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.276
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.945
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.614
It creates a cloud which can be
dispersed over a neighbourhood...

39:27.782 --> 39:28.574
...even a city.

39:28.742 --> 39:32.119
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.288
That's incredible.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.708
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.877
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

39:40.045 --> 39:43.464
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.925
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.304
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

39:50.472 --> 39:52.973
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.975
You can imagine my envy.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.061
We're trying to harness
this capability...

39:57.228 --> 39:59.480
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

39:59.647 --> 40:01.899
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.110
Enter the algorithm now.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.281
Need to take that?

40:15.413 --> 40:16.080
System ready...

40:16.247 --> 40:17.831
...for gene insertion.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.625
Okay.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.543
Check.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.630
See what I'm trying to do?

40:24.798 --> 40:26.673
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.008
Beginning trials.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.761
Pending. Pending.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.471
Failed. Subject deceased.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.598
- Come on, come on, come on.

40:34.766 --> 40:35.641

40:35.809 --> 40:38.227

40:38.394 --> 40:40.020
Subject deceased. Pending.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.898
Peptide algorithm accepted.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.233
Regrowth complete.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.901
- Hey.
- Vitals normal.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.654
Blood pressure normal.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.698
Limb regeneration successful.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.659
Extraordinary.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.706
And thank you.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.583
Meet Fred and Wilma...

41:01.793 --> 41:03.043
...our three-legged...

41:03.211 --> 41:04.336
...mice.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.465
Here you go.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.969
Hey, buddy, I got you.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.596
Okay.

41:14.764 --> 41:16.849
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.892
Human trials aren't until next week.

41:21.855 --> 41:22.688
There.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.822
Hey.

41:32.574 --> 41:34.366
Hey, I thought you...

41:34.534 --> 41:36.451
Didn't you forget something?

41:37.245 --> 41:38.370
What?

41:38.538 --> 41:42.374
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

41:43.418 --> 41:47.337
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.340
Be a man.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.217
Get in there and apologise.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.181
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

41:57.348 --> 41:58.640
Honestly, you don't have...

41:58.808 --> 42:00.392
...to apologise to me. It's your...

42:00.560 --> 42:02.352
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.105
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.191
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.485
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

42:10.653 --> 42:14.114
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

42:14.282 --> 42:15.532
...because you got distracted.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.367
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

42:17.535 --> 42:19.578
...I am completely capable
of walking home...

42:19.746 --> 42:21.788
You will not defend this boy!

42:21.956 --> 42:23.248
- I'm not defending...
- You are!

42:23.416 --> 42:25.918
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.628
You're a lot like your father.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.297
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

42:30.465 --> 42:33.592
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

42:33.760 --> 42:37.095
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

42:37.263 --> 42:39.723
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.475
That's what's at stake here.

42:41.643 --> 42:42.643
Not choice.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.811
Responsibility.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.483
That is nice. That's great.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.611
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

42:53.488 --> 42:55.697
- What?
- Where is he?

42:56.032 --> 42:57.824
Where's my dad?

42:57.992 --> 43:01.495
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

43:01.663 --> 43:02.996
Oh, come on, how dare you?

43:03.164 --> 43:04.873
How dare I? How dare you?

43:09.504 --> 43:10.504
Where you going?

43:10.672 --> 43:12.464
Peter, come back here, please.

43:22.016 --> 43:25.143
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.157
Peter!

43:41.828 --> 43:43.370
Peter?

43:48.876 --> 43:50.377
Peter!

43:55.466 --> 44:00.929
It's $2.07.

44:01.097 --> 44:02.431
Yeah. No, I know.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.434
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.894
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.272
- What?
- You can leave...

44:10.440 --> 44:13.066
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

44:13.234 --> 44:15.152
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.738
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.573
You can't afford milk, step aside.

44:19.741 --> 44:21.992
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

44:22.160 --> 44:23.493
We're talking about 2 cents.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.703
Just step aside, kid.

44:31.544 --> 44:32.627
Really?

44:45.767 --> 44:47.392
Yo, not cool, bro.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.271
Hey, man, stop!

44:51.439 --> 44:52.898
Somebody stop that guy!

44:53.066 --> 44:54.441
Hey, kid, little help?

44:54.609 --> 44:55.984
Not my policy.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.611
Somebody stop that dude!

44:58.613 --> 44:59.279
Hey!

44:59.447 --> 45:00.739
Hey, stop!

45:01.908 --> 45:03.533
Somebody stop that dude!

45:12.210 --> 45:13.085
Hey!

45:43.616 --> 45:45.492
Oh, God, oh, God.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.202
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

45:47.829 --> 45:49.454
Call an ambulance!

45:49.622 --> 45:52.040
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.334
Oh, God, oh, my God.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.714
Oh, God.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.469
No.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.598
Oh, Jesus.

46:12.520 --> 46:16.481
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

46:20.862 --> 46:22.696
No, I don't know him.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.408
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

46:26.576 --> 46:28.535
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

46:28.703 --> 46:30.370
Okay.

46:35.918 --> 46:37.335
Can I have that?

46:37.503 --> 46:38.879
Sure.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.175
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

46:43.342 --> 46:44.092
...tattooed...

46:44.260 --> 46:45.510
...on his left hand.

47:12.997 --> 47:17.501
Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...

47:17.960 --> 47:19.794
...and I'm sorry about that.

47:20.379 --> 47:22.589
I think I know what you're feeling.

47:38.731 --> 47:40.398
Hey, Parker.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.527
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

47:48.783 --> 47:50.617
It feels better, right?

47:51.619 --> 47:53.119
Look, your uncle died.

47:53.788 --> 47:55.247
I'm sorry.

47:55.414 --> 47:56.873
I get it.

47:57.291 --> 47:58.833
I'm sorry.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.794
Okay?

48:07.093 --> 48:08.343
Peter.

48:51.887 --> 48:53.013
Stay away from him.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.180
- You understand?
- Hey!

48:54.348 --> 48:55.765
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

48:58.019 --> 48:59.311
You like beating on girls?

48:59.645 --> 49:01.021
You like beating on old men?

49:01.188 --> 49:01.855
Hey, pal...

49:02.023 --> 49:02.814
...keep walking.

49:02.982 --> 49:05.400
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

49:06.027 --> 49:07.235
I asked you a question.

49:07.403 --> 49:08.320
Nicky, no!

49:08.487 --> 49:09.195
That the gun?

49:09.363 --> 49:10.447
You gonna kill me too?

49:12.450 --> 49:13.575
Hey! Stop it!

49:14.493 --> 49:15.410
Hey, get off!

49:16.537 --> 49:17.829
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

49:17.997 --> 49:19.205
Back up!

49:20.374 --> 49:22.000
This guy is crazy!

49:22.793 --> 49:23.877
Get him!

49:28.382 --> 49:30.634
Get back here, man! Get him!

49:37.391 --> 49:38.224
Follow him!

49:41.937 --> 49:43.605
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

49:52.990 --> 49:53.740
Go, go, go!

49:55.076 --> 49:56.284
There he is!

49:56.452 --> 49:57.285
Can't get away!

50:13.928 --> 50:15.762
He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.

50:27.650 --> 50:28.525
Oh, yeah?

50:28.693 --> 50:29.693
Come on!

50:37.118 --> 50:38.660
I know what you look like!

50:38.828 --> 50:40.620
You hear me?

50:41.038 --> 50:43.415
I've seen your face!

51:21.162 --> 51:22.829
Is that all you got?

51:24.498 --> 51:25.999
Just take it, take it.

51:31.338 --> 51:34.174
Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...

51:34.341 --> 51:38.762
...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...

51:38.929 --> 51:42.682
...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.

51:42.850 --> 51:46.352
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...

51:46.520 --> 51:48.354
...of the lightweight cable.

51:57.323 --> 51:58.114
Mother...

52:55.631 --> 53:00.301
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...

53:00.469 --> 53:02.762
...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.

53:02.930 --> 53:05.682
Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid-30s...

53:05.850 --> 53:08.768
...170 to 180 pounds...

53:08.936 --> 53:10.311
...shoulder-length blond hair.

53:10.479 --> 53:13.106
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

53:32.334 --> 53:33.001
Hey.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.802
You got a description?

53:42.970 --> 53:44.178
Well, no, he wears a mask.

53:44.805 --> 53:45.972
A mask?

53:46.140 --> 53:47.307
Most of his victims...

53:47.474 --> 53:50.852
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

53:51.020 --> 53:53.396
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

53:53.564 --> 53:56.190
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

53:56.358 --> 53:57.483
Get me out of here.

53:58.903 --> 54:00.236
Hey, look!

54:11.373 --> 54:13.333
Spandex. Spandex.

54:14.126 --> 54:15.126
Everything...

54:15.294 --> 54:16.169
...spandex.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.671
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

54:18.839 --> 54:20.673
...of both mass and acceleration.

54:20.841 --> 54:22.634
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

54:22.801 --> 54:25.261
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

54:25.429 --> 54:29.182
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.011
Hey, Aunt May.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.514
Yeah. Eggs?

55:09.682 --> 55:10.848
Organic, got it.

55:43.674 --> 55:45.675
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

55:45.843 --> 55:47.802
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.512
What are you? You a cop?

55:50.347 --> 55:54.600
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

55:54.768 --> 55:56.269
You know, you're...

55:57.021 --> 55:58.438
You've got a mind...

55:58.605 --> 56:00.064
...of the true scholar, sir.

56:00.232 --> 56:02.608
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

56:03.152 --> 56:04.277
Good thinking.

56:04.445 --> 56:05.987
Get out the window.

56:06.155 --> 56:07.447
There you go. You got it.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.290
Crotch!

56:20.127 --> 56:22.462
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

56:22.629 --> 56:23.796
Yes, it's a real knife.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.465
My weakness, it's small knives.

56:25.632 --> 56:27.216
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

56:27.384 --> 56:29.302
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

56:29.470 --> 56:30.928
- That was cool.
- What is this?

56:31.096 --> 56:33.681
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

56:33.849 --> 56:34.515
Let me go!

56:36.435 --> 56:38.144
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

56:38.312 --> 56:39.437
Knock it off, man. No!

56:40.689 --> 56:42.982
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

56:43.817 --> 56:44.859
That isn't funny.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.486
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

56:57.372 --> 56:58.831
This could've gone a lot worse.

56:58.999 --> 57:00.958
Now hold still.

57:06.507 --> 57:07.840
Boys in blue here.

57:08.008 --> 57:10.510
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

57:10.677 --> 57:12.512
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

57:12.679 --> 57:13.679
You serious?

57:13.847 --> 57:15.014
Who are you?

57:15.432 --> 57:17.141
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

57:17.309 --> 57:18.101
Freeze!

57:21.105 --> 57:22.688
I just did 80 percent of your job.

57:23.232 --> 57:23.981
And that?

57:24.149 --> 57:25.066
That's how you repay me?

57:28.695 --> 57:29.862
Hold it right there!

57:50.634 --> 57:51.926
Well, that was fun.

57:53.387 --> 57:55.012
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

57:58.976 --> 58:00.101
What are you doing?

58:04.690 --> 58:05.773
Hey, watch out.

58:05.941 --> 58:08.734
I'm swinging here.

58:23.876 --> 58:26.627
So 38 of New York's finest...

58:26.795 --> 58:29.964
...versus one guy in a unitard.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.091
Am I correct?

58:46.106 --> 58:47.648
You don't have to wait up for me.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.108
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

58:49.276 --> 58:50.276
Yes, I do.

58:50.444 --> 58:51.777
- Okay.
- Where were you?

58:51.945 --> 58:52.987
I was out.

58:53.155 --> 58:55.114
Did you get the eggs?

58:56.658 --> 58:58.159
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

58:58.327 --> 58:59.535
I'm gonna get them now.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.287
No, you most certainly will not.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.456
Not at this hour.

59:05.292 --> 59:07.168
Look at me, Peter.

59:08.921 --> 59:11.505
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

59:19.014 --> 59:22.308
Peter. Where do you go?

59:22.476 --> 59:23.935
Who does this to you?

59:24.102 --> 59:25.895
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

59:26.063 --> 59:28.064
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

59:28.232 --> 59:30.274
...please, please go to sleep.

59:30.442 --> 59:33.486
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

59:44.998 --> 59:47.500
Peter, listen to me.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.418
Secrets have a cost.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.128
They're not for free.

59:51.296 --> 59:53.506
Not now, not ever.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.182
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.686
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.437
It's a miracle.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.189
No, it's hard work and promise.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.358
It's a step closer to the primate lab.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.277
He doesn't have time
for every little step.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.361
Little?

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.071
I just mean he can't wait.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:18.906
Well, he'll have to.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.992
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:22.734
That's not what I'm saying.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.370
So, what are you saying?

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.331
You have to start human trials.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:28.791
Now.

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.127
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:33.254
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.465
Even Norman Osborn.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.633
We are not finished.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.385
Human trials?

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:42.138
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.890
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.935
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:49.437
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:51.647
I don't think I am.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:00.406
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:01.699
About 15 years late.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.743
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.411
Richard Parker wore it well.

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:08.414
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.041
I had nothing to do with that.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.751
Is that what you told his son?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:18.716
I don't know what you're saying.

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:21.427
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.264
I'll remind you what happened.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:28.893
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:34.440
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.193
I...

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.452
I won't.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.289
Fine.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.588
The formula is ours now anyway.

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:01.550
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.260
I'm shutting you down.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.347
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:10.017
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.229
Right, Freddy?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.495
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:30.454
How's it going?

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:31.831
Where you headed?

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:35.376
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.503
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.338
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:40.756
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.550
Maybe I got a rash or...

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.510
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.472
Do you like branzino?

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:50.850
Like, a fish.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.852
No, no. I know. I know.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.229
Well, if you want...

01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:59.900
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.361
My mom's making branzino.

01:03:02.863 --> 01:03:04.280
So...

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.322
It's apartment...

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.825
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:09.326
I don't know why I...

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.328
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:12.872
2016.

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:22.274
Hi.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.860
How did you get out there?

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.279
The fire escape.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:29.949
Your doorman's intimidating.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.493
It's 20 storeys.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.286
Yeah. It's all right.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.459
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.294
Books.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:43.963
Shoes.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.090
Oh, hey...

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.509
I got your mom...

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:50.052
...these.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.303
Oh, lovely.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.138
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.682
They were nice.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.642
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.562
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.272
I'm gonna keep these.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.482
You have your suit in there?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.195
My suit?

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.739
It's for dinner. Are you gonna...?

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.032
Are you gonna wear that?

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.200
- That's...
- Hey, hon.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:19.748
You must be Peter.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.750
Dad, this is Peter.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.629
Nice to meet you, sir.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.965
Nice to meet you.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:29.717
Dinner's ready.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:31.844
Hope you like branzino.

01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:33.554
Who doesn't?

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:34.406
Emma, it's Curt.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:37.368
- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:40.371
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.747
No. He can't, Emma.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.208
You have to stop him. He...

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.794
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:49.922
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call
as soon as possible.

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:03.268
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.479
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:06.897
Bridge! Take the bridge.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.399
All right, we'll do that.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:09.650
Hey, you all right...

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:10.567
...back there?

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:12.152
You tweaking...

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.529
...man?

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.281
Just drive.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.075
Okay.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.833
You're having trouble there?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.668
The head goes on the other...

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:29.378
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:30.754
Oh, I...

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:32.005
I got no idea.

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.716
First time.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.467
- Branzino.
- George.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.387
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.139
No, we didn't catch him yet.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.182
But we will. He's an amateur...

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.060
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.104
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.647
...but he's still dangerous.

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:50.983
He's assaulting people?

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:53.819
I'm not sure.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.446
I mean, I saw that video...

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.573
...with him and the car thief, and...

01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:00.868
I think most people
would say that he was...

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:02.995
...providing a public service.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.664
Most people would be wrong.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:10.419
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:11.837
So why wasn't he then?

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:16.884
Let me illuminate you.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:19.678
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.055
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:25.225
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.895
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:28.937
Good.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.354
I know.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.192
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.109
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.571
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.113
I saw a video on the Internet...

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.823
You saw the video on the Internet.

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.202
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.328
If you watch the video...

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:45.953
Maybe send you a link?

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.790
It looks like he's trying to help.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.834
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:51.667
No, no.

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:53.545
I'm not saying he's a hero.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.048
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.549
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.091
Something the police can't?

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.803
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.513
Sit around eating doughnuts...

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.473
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.683
- George. George.
- Daddy.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:07.600
- Up your what?
- Howard.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.603
He stands for what you stand for.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.313
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.564
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.317
Okay? I wear a badge.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.529
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:21.240
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.575
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.745
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.747
Let's get some air, Peter.

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.542
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.754
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.173
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:41.676
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.929
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.183
- Dad.
- Yeah?

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.859
Well, that was something.

01:09:58.319 --> 01:10:01.405
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

01:10:01.573 --> 01:10:04.199
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:11.665
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.793
Okay.

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.216
I've been bitten...

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:26.430
So have I.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.312
Okay.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:37.316
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.234
I gotta tell you this one thing about...

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:42.237
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.072
What?

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.491
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.327
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.746
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:54.750
It's impo... I wish I could just...

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.168
I can't. It's hard to say.

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:57.336
Just say it.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.630
- I don't know.
- Say it.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.759
What? What?

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:08.931
What?

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.853
Okay, then forget it.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:24.446
You?

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:35.207
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.713
Gwen?

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.299
Gwen...

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:47.260
Your father wants you to come inside.

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:48.887
Okay.

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:50.055
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:53.892
Gwen.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.727
I'm coming.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:28.844
Oh, I'm in trouble.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:53.410
Will you please...

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:55.454
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.754
Excellent.

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.050
Hey!

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.179
Hey! What is that?

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.222
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.807
Get back in the car!

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:24.858
Help!

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:07.192
Incoming!

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:28.880
Somebody help!

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.383
Help me! My kid is trapped!

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.310
I want my dad!

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.687
Dad!

01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:45.230
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Help!

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.064
Hey, buddy.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.399
- It's okay.
- Get away.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:49.484
- Help!
- Hey, look.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.904
Just a normal guy, all right?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:55.490
Wanna hold this?

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:57.993
Hold my mask.

01:14:58.619 --> 01:14:59.536
All right.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.539
What's your name?

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:03.498
Jack?

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.084
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.212
Okay, stay very still.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.213
All right.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:11.631
Okay, I got you.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:16.720
Okay, look.

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.513
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.724
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:23.643
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.939
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:29.816
All right, okay.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:44.789
Jack, climb now.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.583
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.965
Put it on, the mask.

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.550
It's gonna make you strong.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.469
Jack, trust me.

01:15:57.637 --> 01:15:58.595
Put it on.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:02.015
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:03.308
Okay, now, climb.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:04.476
Come on, Jack.

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:08.897
Do me a favour.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.565
A little faster, okay, bud?

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:13.151
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:14.402
That's it. Keep coming.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.987
Keep it coming.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.197
Keep coming.

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.449
No!

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.799
Jack. Oh, God.

01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:37.467
Thank God.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:40.512
You okay?

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.016
My son. My son.

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:46.977
Oh, my son.

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:48.895
My son.

01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:54.442
Who are you?

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.363
Spider-Man.

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.412
Beautiful.

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:56.629
Settle down, guys.

01:17:57.631 --> 01:17:59.257
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.593
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:05.221
...9 p.m. Last night, an incident took
place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:07.599
Much of what occurred
is speculation...

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:10.560
...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:14.147
...to the crime, as well
as our own preliminary findings, have...

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:15.440
...positively placed...

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:17.275
...one individual at the scene.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:18.902
Which is why, this morning...

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:20.487
...I am issuing a warrant...

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:23.990
...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:33.625
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:35.460
...in the first of four meetings...

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.135
It's so beautiful.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.137
Knows how to bite though.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.056
Who else knows about this?

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.099
Just you.

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:50.517
Really?

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.896
Hey, you don't...

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:58.233
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.610
Of course not.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.988
Does it scare you?

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.990
What you can do?

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:12.038
No.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.125
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:18.128
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.046
You gotta lay low.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.215
No, can't do that.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:23.967
You've got to.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.302
I mean, why?

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:29.097
Because of last night.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.266
Those people on the bridge.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:35.437
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:37.772
So...

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.607
...I gotta go after it.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.152
That's not your job.

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:45.155
Maybe it is.

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.619
I really liked kissing you.

01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:55.748
You're an amazing kisser.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:19:59.711
Well, you know, it was...

01:19:59.879 --> 01:20:01.880
It was good for me too.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.176
Yeah?

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:16.728
Who did that?

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:39.459
Hello!

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.304
It's not nice to snoop.

01:20:54.225 --> 01:20:56.100
I gave everyone the week off.

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.020
Yeah.

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:01.606
Shouldn't you be at school?

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.401
No, I got a free track.

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:07.570
I wanted to ask you a question.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.322
How would a predator...

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.782
...track a reptile?

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:13.785
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.203
...of their food chain.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.871
Kings of their domain.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.540
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.292
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.089
Just asking a question.

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:29.092
I got school stuff.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.261
Biology profiles to do.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.930
So because of the cold blood...

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.015
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:37.559
You'd have to catch one first.

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.771
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:43.439
Beautiful and quite large.

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:46.568
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.736
No, it's not yet classified.

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:53.700
But it can be aggressive...

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.535
...if threatened.

01:22:03.294 --> 01:22:04.544
Doc, you all right?

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:07.338
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:09.048
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:11.968
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:14.554
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.473
Good. Good, good.

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.851
Good.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.146
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.482
Wonderful things are coming.

01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:29.527
Wonderful things.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.376
Fred?

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:52.383
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.053
...running around
you would be the first to know.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.764
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:59.974
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.352
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:04.395
Mr. Parker, why are you...

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:06.397
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:07.815
Okay, well, I do not.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.233
So make your point quickly.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.778
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:14.238
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:15.990
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.533
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.202
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.371
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:22.747
- That's the one.
- Okay.

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:26.209
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:28.419
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:30.755
You would have me believe
that he...

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.132
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.969
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:41.766
Let me ask you a question.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.061
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.689
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.900
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:54.612
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.240
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:24:01.119
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.746
Okay. All right, I get it.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:05.665
Here's what we'll do.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:08.918
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:11.295
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.506
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:15.925
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:19.053
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:22.265
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

01:24:22.433 --> 01:24:24.058
He is a danger to everybody.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.477
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:32.150
Jimmy.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.237
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:38.740
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:06.309
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

01:25:06.477 --> 01:25:08.019
Current temperature: 89.7.

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:09.645
Steady for 48 hours.

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:12.315
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:14.150
...consistent with subject's past.

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:21.574
Clotting rate vastly improved.

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.242
Marked enhancement...

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:24.744
...in muscle response...

01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:26.287
...strength and elasticity.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.214
Eyesight similarly improved.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.883
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:46.140
This is no longer about curing ills.

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.059
This is about...

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:49.310
...finding perfection.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.655
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:04.575
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:41.130
You stopped me once.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:44.342
You won't stop me again.

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:49.347
I'm getting stronger every day!

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:29.637
Oh, that sucked.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.733
Peter Parker.

01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:01.961
Come in.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:05.756
You should maybe...

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.758
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:12.430
Also, my father is under
the impression...

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.433
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.268
Peter.

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:18.811
What happened?

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:20.312
You should see the other guy.

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:26.569
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:27.737
Hey, Gwen, honey.

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:28.821
Do you want cocoa?

01:29:28.989 --> 01:29:30.114
Howard's making some.

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:36.120
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:37.955
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:38.956
Okay.

01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:43.169
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.795
Well, that's impractical.

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:46.380
And fattening.

01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:50.718
Chocolate house.

01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:55.389
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:58.350
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work...

01:29:58.518 --> 01:30:01.604
I'm doing this...

01:30:01.772 --> 01:30:03.397
I have cramps.

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:06.317
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:08.778
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:10.654
- Good.
- It's brutal.

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:12.865
You don't want to know.

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:14.200
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:16.327
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:43.854
Easy, Bug Boy.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:46.023
What'd you call me?

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:52.947
I'm going to be all right.

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:55.825
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

01:30:57.202 --> 01:30:59.703
I know what this is.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.205
What is it?

01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:05.292
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.919
...has left every morning...

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:09.755
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:12.216
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:17.263
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:19.890
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:31.277
I got you.

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:37.408
Okay?

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:41.078
I gotta stop him, though.

01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:44.665
I have to, because I created him.

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:49.420
What do you mean?

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:52.923
I gave him an equation...

01:31:55.468 --> 01:31:57.595
...that made all of this possible.

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:08.105
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:11.275
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:16.530
Point is, this is my responsibility.

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:22.036
I have to fix it.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.790
Peter.

01:32:27.834 --> 01:32:29.543
Hey.

01:32:32.839 --> 01:32:34.965
Let's get out of here.

01:32:35.133 --> 01:32:36.926
Let's just get out of here.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:38.802
Just for a minute. Can we?

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:41.472
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:42.806
- Yes.
- No.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.141
Yes.

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:46.810
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.484
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.457
Peter Parker.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.292
Spider-Man.

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:12.419
I'm not the one who needs...

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:13.879
...help.

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:15.756
There will be no more loneliness...

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:17.383
...no more outcasts.

01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:21.303
Species-wide distribution
could enhance...

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:23.847
...humanity on an evolutionary scale.

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:26.642
One has to adapt to survive.

01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.731
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:36.527
...to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:39.863
Would you give it all up
after all you know...

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:40.990
...you can do?

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:43.784
All the power you feel.

01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:48.539
I can save...

01:33:48.707 --> 01:33:49.623
...them!

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:57.339
You won't get in...

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:58.674
...the way of my plan...

01:33:58.842 --> 01:34:00.467
...Peter Parker!

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:28.120
Go. Go!

01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:06.492
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.052
All these souls...

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.470
...lost and alone.

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:27.513
I can save them.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.306
I can cure them.

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:31.058
There's no need to stop me...

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:32.142
...Peter.

01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:43.779
You're not thinking straight, doc.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.118
Stop this. This isn't you.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:55.249
Let's talk this out.

01:35:56.376 --> 01:35:57.126
Doc!

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:04.258
Oh, boy.

01:36:09.848 --> 01:36:10.889
You don't want to talk?

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.267
There you go.

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:18.105
Don't...

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:20.274
...make me...

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:21.650
...have to...

01:36:22.152 --> 01:36:23.110
...hurt you!

01:36:30.994 --> 01:36:32.327
That is disgusting.

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.755
Gwen.

01:37:07.697 --> 01:37:09.907
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:24.171
Somebody's been...

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:26.006
...a bad lizard.

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:14.972
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:18.600
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:29.570
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:42.708
- Hey.
- Where are you?

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:43.792
I'm fine. I'm okay.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.337
I'm in the sewer, tracking him.
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:48.630
But we need an antidote.

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:51.383
- Do you know how to run a serum?
- I do it all the time.

01:38:51.551 --> 01:38:53.969
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:57.139
I need you to access
the cross-species file. It's a blue serum.

01:38:57.307 --> 01:38:59.433
File 12389.

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:00.684
Okay, got it.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:02.603
On my way.

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:37.721
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:40.057
...without outcasts.

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:42.768
I sought to create
a stronger human being...

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:44.853
...but there's no such thing.

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:48.273
Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded...

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.108
...creatures.

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:51.735
Why be human at all...

01:39:51.903 --> 01:39:53.153
...when we can be so...

01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:54.154
...much more?

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:56.615
Faster. Stronger.

01:39:56.783 --> 01:39:58.200
Smarter.

01:39:58.368 --> 01:40:01.203
This is my gift to you.

01:40:09.712 --> 01:40:11.380
Oscorp.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:14.758
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:17.386
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.763
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:21.139
Inside the high school.

01:40:21.307 --> 01:40:23.225
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

01:42:10.208 --> 01:42:12.709
The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.

01:42:12.877 --> 01:42:14.669
All efforts to stop him have failed...

01:42:14.837 --> 01:42:18.048
...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

01:42:22.053 --> 01:42:22.928
- Hi.
- Where are you?

01:42:23.095 --> 01:42:24.387
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:26.306
You have to get out of there now.

01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:28.850
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

01:42:29.018 --> 01:42:31.478
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.

01:42:31.646 --> 01:42:34.189
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:35.524
Eight minutes left.

01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:38.235
You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?

01:42:38.402 --> 01:42:39.736
You leave right now.

01:42:39.904 --> 01:42:40.946
That is an order, okay?

01:42:41.113 --> 01:42:42.197
I'll get everybody out.

01:42:42.365 --> 01:42:43.865
Did you hear wh...?

01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:47.077
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

01:43:03.594 --> 01:43:04.761
He's heading south.

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:17.524
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

01:43:17.692 --> 01:43:19.442
You are surrounded. There is...

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.944
...no escape.

01:43:21.404 --> 01:43:22.821
Go, go!

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:26.134
Clear!

01:44:26.302 --> 01:44:27.427
Clear up top!

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:30.513
Clear, sir!

01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:31.848
All clear here, sir!

01:44:57.333 --> 01:44:58.875
Freeze!

01:44:59.543 --> 01:45:00.710
Down on the ground.

01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:02.337
Your hands behind your head.

01:45:02.505 --> 01:45:04.130
Now!

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:08.969
Parker.

01:45:10.846 --> 01:45:11.846
It's headed to Oscorp!

01:45:12.014 --> 01:45:14.391
And your daughter's there right now.

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.446
You gotta let me go.

01:45:43.045 --> 01:45:43.795
Hold your fire!

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:53.388
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:55.974
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

01:45:56.142 --> 01:45:58.059
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

01:45:58.227 --> 01:46:01.479
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:19.789
Time remaining: One minute.

01:47:32.738 --> 01:47:34.823
Antidote complete.

01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:49.379
Oh, man.

01:47:49.547 --> 01:47:52.215
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

01:47:52.383 --> 01:47:54.050
The New York Police Department...

01:47:54.218 --> 01:47:56.219
...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:58.346
...everything south of 54th Street.

01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:00.974
If you are south of 54th Street...

01:48:01.142 --> 01:48:03.601
...you have to move out
of the area immediately.

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:15.655
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:16.865
He looks injured...

01:48:17.032 --> 01:48:19.701
...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.

01:48:19.869 --> 01:48:20.952
That's the guy who...

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.495
...saved my boy on the bridge.

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:24.038
Troy, they're clearing us out.

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:26.624
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

01:48:26.792 --> 01:48:29.377
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

01:48:29.545 --> 01:48:31.462
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:33.715
The cops are evacuating everybody.

01:48:33.883 --> 01:48:36.092
Get him on the phone for me.

01:48:53.694 --> 01:48:56.321
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

01:48:56.488 --> 01:48:58.573
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

01:48:58.741 --> 01:49:01.075
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

01:49:02.453 --> 01:49:04.412
All tower cranes on 6th...

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:08.291
...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:10.793
Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and lined up.

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:13.004
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

01:49:46.747 --> 01:49:48.414
Come on, Parker.

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:44.864
Hey.

01:51:45.157 --> 01:51:46.240
Dad!

01:51:46.408 --> 01:51:48.576
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

01:51:48.744 --> 01:51:50.578
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:53.623
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

01:51:53.791 --> 01:51:56.042
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

01:51:56.210 --> 01:51:57.377
I get it.

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:58.628
Give me this.

01:51:58.796 --> 01:52:00.630
Get in the car.

01:52:04.218 --> 01:52:06.302
Please make sure he's okay.

01:52:18.816 --> 01:52:21.818
Initializing Ganali device.

01:52:21.985 --> 01:52:24.987
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

01:53:47.279 --> 01:53:49.822
Poor Peter Parker.

01:53:50.949 --> 01:53:54.744
No mother, no father...

01:53:55.871 --> 01:53:57.622
...no uncle.

01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:00.666
All alone.

01:54:01.919 --> 01:54:02.919
He's not alone.

01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.565
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

01:54:33.450 --> 01:54:34.242
Hey!

01:54:34.409 --> 01:54:35.159
Gift from Gwen.

01:54:37.663 --> 01:54:39.121
I got this, Peter! Go!

01:54:45.045 --> 01:54:46.796
T-minus...

01:54:46.964 --> 01:54:48.130
...30 seconds.

01:55:05.899 --> 01:55:07.358
Detonation in T-minus...

01:55:07.526 --> 01:55:09.235
...10 seconds.

01:55:09.695 --> 01:55:10.695
Nine.

01:55:11.905 --> 01:55:13.447
Eight.

01:55:13.615 --> 01:55:14.991
Seven.

01:55:15.492 --> 01:55:16.784
Six.

01:55:17.578 --> 01:55:18.869
Five.

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.288
Four.

01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:22.248
Three.

01:55:24.001 --> 01:55:24.667
Two.

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.086
One.

01:55:52.863 --> 01:55:54.530
No.

01:55:56.033 --> 01:55:58.034
No!

01:57:09.106 --> 01:57:10.231
The captain.

01:57:11.775 --> 01:57:13.275
Captain!

01:57:15.946 --> 01:57:17.363
The Lizard.

01:57:17.531 --> 01:57:18.239
It's okay.

01:57:18.407 --> 01:57:19.615
We stopped him.

01:57:20.283 --> 01:57:21.158
Okay.

01:57:21.326 --> 01:57:23.494
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:26.163
Okay, okay, okay.

01:57:26.331 --> 01:57:27.790
Look at me. Stay with me.

01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:30.042
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:33.713
You need to be gone
when they get here.

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.214
Okay?

01:57:35.382 --> 01:57:36.674
I'm not going anywhere.

01:57:37.259 --> 01:57:39.677
I was wrong about you, Peter.

01:57:40.387 --> 01:57:41.929
This city needs you.

01:57:43.932 --> 01:57:45.516
Here.

01:57:45.684 --> 01:57:46.851
You're gonna need this.

01:57:51.273 --> 01:57:53.232
You're gonna make enemies.

01:57:55.652 --> 01:57:57.486
People will get hurt.

01:57:59.072 --> 01:58:00.990
Sometimes the people closest to you.

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.912
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

01:58:08.832 --> 01:58:12.626
Leave Gwen out of it.

01:58:15.172 --> 01:58:16.797
Promise me that.

01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:24.096
You promise me.

01:59:37.796 --> 01:59:39.046
An eerie calm...

01:59:39.214 --> 01:59:41.257
...has set in over New York City.

01:59:41.424 --> 01:59:42.716
Apparently, some sort of...

01:59:42.884 --> 01:59:45.886
...aerosolized antidote
was launched from...

01:59:46.054 --> 01:59:49.265
...Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:52.393
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...

01:59:52.561 --> 01:59:54.562
...knowing that
the alleged mastermind...

01:59:54.729 --> 01:59:58.357
...of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

01:59:58.525 --> 01:59:59.900
We've got John Niles...

02:00:00.068 --> 02:00:02.486
...on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.

02:00:02.654 --> 02:00:04.697
John, what do you see?

02:00:37.564 --> 02:00:39.607
Sweetheart, it's all right.

02:00:41.776 --> 02:00:46.155
It's all right.

02:00:46.656 --> 02:00:47.615
Rough night.

02:00:49.701 --> 02:00:51.368
It's gonna be all right.

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:46.840
Where have you been?

02:01:49.844 --> 02:01:51.428
Hi.

02:01:56.267 --> 02:01:57.893
My father died.

02:02:01.856 --> 02:02:03.607
There was a funeral.

02:02:05.068 --> 02:02:06.402
They shot off...

02:02:08.405 --> 02:02:11.156
...rifles and they made speeches.

02:02:14.703 --> 02:02:16.662
Two of my teachers showed up.

02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:19.456
And Flash showed up.

02:02:24.379 --> 02:02:27.006
Everyone was there but you.

02:02:41.604 --> 02:02:43.731
Can't do this. Can't do this.

02:02:45.984 --> 02:02:48.027
I'm sorry. I can't...

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:49.611
What are you saying?

02:02:49.779 --> 02:02:51.613
I can't see you anymore.

02:02:53.575 --> 02:02:55.034
I can't.

02:03:20.643 --> 02:03:22.644
He made you promise, didn't he?

02:03:26.649 --> 02:03:30.527
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

02:03:57.013 --> 02:03:57.846
What a pretty...

02:03:58.014 --> 02:03:58.889
...girl.

02:03:59.057 --> 02:04:00.224
Yeah.

02:04:00.391 --> 02:04:02.184
That's what Uncle Ben said.

02:04:03.228 --> 02:04:04.895
Did you ask her out?

02:04:08.650 --> 02:04:09.983
Why?

02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:12.528
Can't.

02:04:13.822 --> 02:04:15.197
Why?

02:04:17.784 --> 02:04:19.493
I'm just no good for her.

02:04:22.664 --> 02:04:26.125
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:28.335
Anyone has a problem...

02:04:28.503 --> 02:04:30.212
...with that can talk to me.

02:04:47.939 --> 02:04:50.983
Peter, I know things have been...

02:04:51.151 --> 02:04:52.359
...difficult lately...

02:04:52.527 --> 02:04:54.611
...and I'm sorry about that.

02:04:55.029 --> 02:04:57.990
I think I know what you're feeling.

02:04:58.158 --> 02:05:00.742
Ever since you were a little boy...

02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:05.330
...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.

02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:08.834
Well, take it from an old man:

02:05:09.419 --> 02:05:12.504
Those things send us
down a road.

02:05:12.672 --> 02:05:13.755
They make us...

02:05:13.923 --> 02:05:15.007
...who we are.

02:05:15.258 --> 02:05:20.512
And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.

02:05:21.097 --> 02:05:23.515
You owe the world your gifts.

02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.977
You just have to figure out
how to use them.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:30.856
And know that wherever
they take you...

02:05:31.024 --> 02:05:33.317
...we'll always be here.

02:05:34.152 --> 02:05:36.737
So come on home, Peter.

02:05:37.614 --> 02:05:39.448
You're my hero.

02:05:39.616 --> 02:05:41.116
And I love you.

02:05:49.542 --> 02:05:51.251
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

02:05:51.419 --> 02:05:52.878
Hey. How's it going?

02:05:53.838 --> 02:05:55.214
You coming along, man?

02:05:56.799 --> 02:05:57.633
Cool shirt.

02:05:59.510 --> 02:06:00.636
Yeah.

02:06:00.803 --> 02:06:02.304
Dude's crazy.

02:06:02.472 --> 02:06:03.847
But chicks dig him.

02:06:06.643 --> 02:06:09.353
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

02:06:18.821 --> 02:06:21.698
I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...

02:06:21.866 --> 02:06:25.118
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

02:06:26.079 --> 02:06:28.163
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

02:06:28.331 --> 02:06:29.748
There is only one:

02:06:30.667 --> 02:06:32.167
"Who am I"?

02:06:32.877 --> 02:06:34.795
Mr. Parker.

02:06:34.963 --> 02:06:35.963
Tardy again.

02:06:37.924 --> 02:06:39.758
At least we can always count on you.

02:06:39.926 --> 02:06:42.678
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

02:06:42.845 --> 02:06:44.930
Don't make promises you can't keep.

02:06:47.183 --> 02:06:49.351
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

02:06:49.519 --> 02:06:51.353
Okay, class, open your books.

02:06:51.521 --> 02:06:53.522
Let's begin on page one.

02:09:48.781 --> 02:09:51.366
Hello, doctor.

02:09:51.534 --> 02:09:52.868
Did you tell the boy?

02:09:53.035 --> 02:09:54.077
Tell him what?

02:09:54.245 --> 02:09:57.998
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

02:09:59.667 --> 02:10:00.542
No.

02:10:00.710 --> 02:10:02.294
Well, that's very good.

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:03.712
So we'll let him be...

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:04.838
...for now.

02:10:05.882 --> 02:10:07.966
You should leave him alone!
