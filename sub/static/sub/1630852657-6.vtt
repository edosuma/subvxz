WEBVTT

00:06.041 --> 00:08.333
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.458 --> 00:13.708
Damn it, Conrado. You of all people!

00:14.791 --> 00:16.666
I didn't expect this from you.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.666
So, you're telling me

00:21.750 --> 00:25.958
you're the one
who brought the acid to the hotel?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.250
Whoa!

00:38.875 --> 00:41.875
-What are you doing, man?
-I'm protecting my friend!

00:41.958 --> 00:44.041
Are you crazy? What the hell?

00:45.916 --> 00:47.958
Look at me. Relax.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.666
Let's go to a quieter place,
so we can talk.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.833
Breathe. Come on.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.291
In the last few days, I don't know

01:00.666 --> 01:01.875
what came over me.

01:05.541 --> 01:09.041
I ended up getting away from things
I've always believed in.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.375
And I think it's best if I leave
so I can understand

01:15.458 --> 01:17.000
what's going on with me.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.875
You must keep calm.
You're not thinking straight.

01:21.958 --> 01:24.375
You need to hear me out. Just trust me.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.875
I'll talk to Maresia. We'll fix this.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.500
Do you think he'll listen?

01:30.500 --> 01:33.125
We know it wasn't you, but,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.791
Conrado, you're already part
of this family.

01:39.541 --> 01:40.375
You can go.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.791
Think about what happened here.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.125
And if you want to come back,

01:48.041 --> 01:50.916
we'll always be here for you.

01:53.291 --> 01:54.208
Thank you.

01:57.625 --> 01:58.625
I appreciate it.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.833
Look!

02:06.916 --> 02:09.958
The new couple
is on a date this early in the morning!

02:10.041 --> 02:12.666
So cute! Is it your day off?

02:13.375 --> 02:14.208
No.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.458
-Have you set the breakfast table?
-No.

02:16.541 --> 02:17.541
Who did it?

02:18.208 --> 02:19.875
Nobody, right?

02:19.958 --> 02:21.083
Where's Helena?

02:21.166 --> 02:23.291
-I don't know.
-Another bad day, huh?

02:23.375 --> 02:24.208
Good morning.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.000
Relax.

02:44.416 --> 02:45.541
Oh my God!

03:05.583 --> 03:09.583
-Good morning!
-Good morning, Alice!

03:10.541 --> 03:13.166
It seems you've just came back
from Wonderland.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.625
Nah, I didn't even get wasted yesterday.

03:15.708 --> 03:18.583
-Which was great, because--
-Here she comes.

03:18.666 --> 03:23.583
Marília, guess who can't star
in <i>Never Have I Ever</i>!

03:25.958 --> 03:27.416
Okay, another clue.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.791
Guess who'll be able to laugh

03:28.875 --> 03:31.750
at <i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i> now? Huh?

03:33.791 --> 03:37.125
For fuck's sake!
Guess who's not a virgin anymore?

03:37.708 --> 03:41.166
Helena! Wait. With whom?

03:41.750 --> 03:42.916
Léo Pororoca.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
-The bully?
-Who'd have thought.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.583
Now he's my booty call.
Every Pokémon evolves. I believe.

03:49.708 --> 03:53.458
Girl, you're totally out of your tree.
But fine. Are you okay?

03:54.208 --> 03:56.875
-Was it nice?
-Well, I guess.

03:56.958 --> 03:58.833
I don't have much to compare.

03:58.916 --> 04:01.041
But it finally happened.

04:01.625 --> 04:04.708
Right. You guys used a condom, right?

04:07.875 --> 04:10.541
-Helena.
-No! Yes, of course.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.083
Are you crazy? Obviously.

04:13.791 --> 04:16.625
Sorry, it's just that I care about you.

04:16.708 --> 04:19.041
Now, take all this energy,

04:19.125 --> 04:21.708
put on your uniform, and look.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.875
She's doing everything by herself.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.541
Let's get to work?

04:28.625 --> 04:29.458
All right.

04:33.583 --> 04:34.958
I'll bring it in a few.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.500
I mean, our room service will bring it.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.416
It'll be there soon. Thank you.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.708
Catarina, breathe.

04:41.791 --> 04:44.416
The staff will be back to help you.

04:44.916 --> 04:48.333
And the responsible for this
is no longer here. Okay?

04:48.875 --> 04:50.250
Is it at room 15?

04:50.750 --> 04:52.541
-Room 14.
-Okay, I'll bring it.

05:01.791 --> 05:03.875
Maresia, what happened to Conrado?

05:13.750 --> 05:16.416
-I know where he's at. Bring everyone.
-Okay.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.916
I knew I'd find you here.

05:31.791 --> 05:33.916
I had to say goodbye to this place.

05:39.791 --> 05:40.625
Conrado…

05:43.083 --> 05:45.208
you're crazy for doing that. Why?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.958
-That thing was Rodrigo's.
-But you brought it here.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.375
Who'd be blamed?

05:53.125 --> 05:55.125
Okay. Okay, great.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.750
I'd rather take the blame instead of you.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.791
Think of this as my way of thanking you.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.083
For everything you've done.

06:09.666 --> 06:10.500
For us.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.958
Conrado!

06:19.041 --> 06:20.541
I had to talk to you.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.708
I never meant to hurt you.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.791
You know that, right? I never--

06:30.625 --> 06:31.458
I know.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.541
I'm really happy for you.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.166
I mean it.

06:39.708 --> 06:42.000
And you, God is with you.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.208
Always. Don't forget it.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.333
Let's live it up.

06:46.833 --> 06:50.375
Don't act like it's
the end of the season. I mean it.

06:51.083 --> 06:55.166
No, come here! Marília and Diego too.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.875
Guys, I'm fine.
For real, I'm absolutely fine.

06:59.375 --> 07:03.083
I've gone through a lot this summer,
you don't need to worry.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.125
But listen,

07:06.208 --> 07:08.125
Catarina needs your help.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.625
Guys! Is it true that Miguel--

07:10.708 --> 07:11.666
Did you get fired?

07:34.791 --> 07:35.875
Thank you, Dimas.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.250
This is yours.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.291
It stays here.

08:01.541 --> 08:03.500
Guys, no, don't cry.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.291
Helena, please.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.666
Don't cry. It's okay.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.500
I'm fine. You hear me?

08:11.166 --> 08:12.000
I'm fine.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.000
You guys take care.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.375
Be happy.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.166
A battle a day, remember?

08:37.208 --> 08:38.083
Conrado!

08:41.958 --> 08:43.333
<i>You have to be brave</i>

08:45.250 --> 08:47.541
<i>To look in the mirror</i>
<i>Face who you are</i>

08:47.625 --> 08:49.791
<i>With fears, flaws, whatever comes</i>

08:50.583 --> 08:52.708
<i>You need to be brave to stand</i>

08:52.791 --> 08:56.583
<i>In this world, it still hurts</i>
<i>Being black, poor, gay or woman</i>

08:57.791 --> 09:02.333
<i>Everything that's real attracts cowards</i>
<i>Trying to steal our identities from us</i>

09:04.291 --> 09:06.541
<i>Some count on luck, others on faith</i>

09:07.458 --> 09:08.416
<i>As for me</i>

09:10.000 --> 09:12.375
<i>I honestly don't even know what happened</i>

09:13.041 --> 09:15.875
<i>I just know</i>
<i>I got a little bit closer to God</i>

09:16.458 --> 09:18.583
<i>And I realized I'm much more than pain</i>

09:18.666 --> 09:21.083
<i>I carry all colors</i>
<i>I wanna feel the love</i>

09:21.583 --> 09:23.000
<i>And, yes, I do scream</i>

09:23.083 --> 09:24.708
<i>Not to die silenced</i>

09:24.791 --> 09:26.916
<i>I still deserve to be loved</i>

09:27.000 --> 09:29.500
<i>And I won't turn the other cheek</i>

09:30.375 --> 09:32.708
<i>I remembered a friend who taught me</i>

09:33.208 --> 09:34.708
<i>That I have a past</i>

09:34.791 --> 09:38.583
<i>Even so, I deserve to be happy</i>
<i>And appreciate the view</i>

09:40.041 --> 09:41.291
<i>Because, sometimes</i>

09:42.375 --> 09:45.291
<i>We need to stop</i>
<i>And start the journey over</i>

09:45.375 --> 09:46.458
<i>To do that</i>

09:49.208 --> 09:51.625
<i>You have to be very, very brave</i>

10:26.416 --> 10:28.208
Look, it'll be fine.

10:28.291 --> 10:32.166
We promised we'd help Catarina,
and we will.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.416
Let's go, team!

10:34.000 --> 10:36.166
Hi, guys. Sorry, I'm late.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.083
Did you bring the notes?

10:40.083 --> 10:41.166
What notes?

10:41.250 --> 10:43.791
About what we are talking to Catarina.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.583
Great, now I'm daydreaming.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.083
No, sorry. I forgot.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.791
Marília is not coming.
She's taking Sofia to class.

10:52.875 --> 10:53.916
Hey!

10:54.708 --> 10:55.583
What happened?

11:01.750 --> 11:04.250
-What's this? An intervention?
-Kind of.

11:04.750 --> 11:05.666
For me?

11:06.916 --> 11:07.833
Yes.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.958
Guys, I love it! This is what I needed!

11:12.041 --> 11:13.916
I had even thought about it.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.916
I actually had set
some tasks for you. May I?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.666
-Shoot!
-Go ahead.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.333
Yasmin, your task is the hardest one.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.458
Can you stop

11:25.958 --> 11:28.916
my mom's attempts to talk to me?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.958
-Are you sure, Catarina?
-Yes.

11:31.041 --> 11:34.000
It's extreme, I know.
But I really need that.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.666
My mom and I--

11:37.500 --> 11:40.291
It's a long story. It's complicated.

11:41.416 --> 11:43.375
I don't know.

11:43.458 --> 11:47.166
I think she tried to replace
her presence and her love

11:47.250 --> 11:49.416
with material things, you know?

11:49.916 --> 11:52.250
As if they'd fill me up inside.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.291
I've got this.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.875
Mission "Blocking Mommy."

11:58.541 --> 11:59.375
All right.

12:00.041 --> 12:00.875
Let's do this.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.250
Helena.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.916
Uninstall all shopping apps
from my phone. Be quick!

12:06.750 --> 12:08.666
Sure, right away.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.916
-Miguel.
-Hey.

12:10.458 --> 12:14.208
There's another toxic person
that I need to avoid.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.708
I know. Rodrigo?

12:16.458 --> 12:20.666
Yes. My mom and him are alike.
So, that's a trigger.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.333
Cool, count me in.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.916
And, lastly,

12:27.125 --> 12:27.958
well,

12:28.458 --> 12:30.791
I'm gonna need someone available

12:30.875 --> 12:32.750
in case I have a relapse.

12:33.333 --> 12:34.833
Like a mentor.

12:36.958 --> 12:37.875
Diego?

12:38.541 --> 12:40.875
Well, if everyone's helping…

12:44.375 --> 12:46.208
-Thanks.
-Yeah!

12:49.083 --> 12:50.291
Thanks, guys.

12:52.625 --> 12:53.458
Hi.

12:54.083 --> 12:54.916
Good morning.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.500
I'm late, but I'm here.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.625
What's up? Training?

13:04.166 --> 13:05.250
What is it, coach?

13:05.875 --> 13:06.916
I'm ready.

13:07.416 --> 13:08.708
I was ready too,

13:09.291 --> 13:11.791
at 6:00 a.m. at the beach. Remember?

13:14.041 --> 13:17.541
-I know I'm late. I'm sorry--
-Rodrigo, what was our deal?

13:18.291 --> 13:20.250
First mistake, game over.

13:21.541 --> 13:25.041
Your little party cost me a lot
with the staff.

13:26.791 --> 13:27.625
Maresia,

13:28.333 --> 13:30.708
this scout is my only chance to make it.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.291
You have no right to take this from me!

13:38.375 --> 13:41.625
Rodrigo, you know
who you sound like right now?

13:42.125 --> 13:42.958
Your dad.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.125
All right, it's clear.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.666
Look at her! I'm proud of you!

14:04.291 --> 14:05.750
Miguel, look!

14:08.250 --> 14:09.458
Weird, right?

14:10.541 --> 14:12.958
Maresia, do you know where Elias is going?

14:14.916 --> 14:16.833
Those houses are harmless.

14:16.916 --> 14:20.250
Twelve, 15, 36 here. All right.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.291
We've always lived in the island.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.250
Thirty-eight.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.250
Our parents, grandparents,
our children live there.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.666
-Mr. Elias.
-What are you saying?

14:32.750 --> 14:36.625
-Must you demolish the village?
-Village, Dimas?

14:36.708 --> 14:39.750
That's a slum, and you know it.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.500
It's ruining the spa view.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.166
Who do you work for? Huh?

14:44.833 --> 14:45.750
For you, sir.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.958
You can't forget about that.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.875
Why is this material here, Elias?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.541
Because we'll resume the construction.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.208
-Why?
-Because it's embargoed.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.541
Let's talk at the office. Please.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.958
What will you do?
Call the environmental police?

15:04.041 --> 15:04.875
Is that it?

15:05.833 --> 15:07.583
You should know, Maresia,

15:08.500 --> 15:12.000
that I got the police chief
and the mayor elected.

15:12.958 --> 15:16.041
The machines are ready to roll
here and at the village.

15:16.833 --> 15:20.583
Right? I guess it's time to choose
which side you're on.

15:20.666 --> 15:24.583
Actually, I've already chosen.
I know which side I'm on.

15:26.416 --> 15:29.166
I was the one
who reported this construction.

15:29.916 --> 15:32.291
If you insist, I'll report it again.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.750
Look at that, my own partner.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.458
Maresia, here's the deal.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.708
If it wasn't for my money

15:43.791 --> 15:46.750
and my contacts,
the hotel you say is yours

15:47.750 --> 15:51.916
would have closed a long time ago.
And you and that spoilsport

15:53.875 --> 15:55.083
wouldn't have a job.

15:56.833 --> 15:57.916
Excuse me.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.166
Out of my way.

16:24.666 --> 16:25.500
Hi, Dad.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.458
I don't wanna see you

16:27.541 --> 16:30.875
near Maresia and that gang
from the hotel, okay?

16:32.416 --> 16:34.333
I don't think they wanna see me.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.041
I'm going on a business trip.
When I come back,

16:40.875 --> 16:42.333
I want you out of my house.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.833
<i>Diego.</i>

17:26.583 --> 17:27.750
<i>Help me.</i>

17:29.250 --> 17:32.458
<i>Diego, help me, brother.</i>

17:44.916 --> 17:45.750
<i>Diego!</i>

17:47.583 --> 17:48.416
<i>Diego!</i>

17:49.250 --> 17:50.083
<i>Help!</i>

17:52.333 --> 17:53.166
<i>Diego!</i>

17:53.875 --> 17:54.875
Diego.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.125
Diego.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.291
Did you wanna talk to me?

18:15.791 --> 18:17.708
Actually, to my mentor.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.833
-What's this?
-It was in my pocket.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.166
I couldn't give it away
at the intervention.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.166
You don't need to worry.
You won't see it anymore.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.375
-Were you training for the test?
-Yes, I was.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.041
But I gave up.

18:49.375 --> 18:50.208
Yes.

18:50.833 --> 18:51.708
I gave up.

18:52.416 --> 18:53.333
How come?

18:56.083 --> 18:58.291
I'd rather give up on a dream,

18:58.375 --> 19:00.500
than live in a nightmare.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.083
Diego,

19:04.833 --> 19:05.916
giving up

19:06.416 --> 19:08.166
is not a solution.

19:09.375 --> 19:12.750
I know how much this matters to you.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.875
It wasn't your fault.

19:20.416 --> 19:24.333
-What happened to your brother--
-Stop. Don't do that, please.

19:29.833 --> 19:30.708
I was there.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.250
You weren't.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.958
I saw everything. Do you understand?

19:42.458 --> 19:43.375
I do.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.208
-Find another mentor.
-What? No! Diego!

19:55.291 --> 19:58.208
-Diego, wait! Diego!
<i>-Catarina? Yasmin?</i>

19:58.291 --> 20:00.500
Shit! Diego!

20:00.583 --> 20:02.500
<i>There's no one at the reception.</i>

20:04.041 --> 20:04.875
I'm coming.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.458
-This word means "girl" around here.
-So girl is…

20:14.500 --> 20:16.875
Sorry about that. How can I help you?

20:16.958 --> 20:20.916
I think I left my wallet here
when I paid for the tour.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.833
Did someone find it?

20:22.916 --> 20:24.625
Yes, I found it. Here it is.

20:39.708 --> 20:40.541
Thank you.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.875
I know it's been tense
with Conrado's leave,

20:53.958 --> 20:56.666
and with what happened
at the construction site.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.625
But Maresia Hotel is a place

20:58.708 --> 21:01.458
where we feel good and happy.

21:01.541 --> 21:05.208
So, today, I wanna celebrate
one month of this wonderful staff.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.416
One month, guys!

21:11.250 --> 21:14.666
And I heard that this lemon pie

21:14.750 --> 21:17.208
is the favorite of someone

21:17.291 --> 21:20.583
who bet with me they'd go home
after a month here.

21:21.583 --> 21:24.166
-Miguel!
-Hey, Miguel!

21:25.375 --> 21:28.333
So, here's my question.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.416
Does someone here owe me money?

21:32.166 --> 21:35.833
And my question is,
who'll get the first slice?

21:37.333 --> 21:40.625
I met really nice people here this summer.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.958
But one person changed my life forever.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.958
-My dad.
-Say what?

21:48.041 --> 21:50.166
-What?
-I didn't know. Did you?

21:50.250 --> 21:53.916
Yes, guys, I've known this
since the beginning of the summer.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.875
But I didn't tell you

21:55.958 --> 21:58.666
because I was still learning
to adapt, you know?

21:58.750 --> 22:02.083
-Before telling you.
-Did you know that?

22:02.166 --> 22:06.125
Oh God, I'm in love
with the boss' daughter.

22:06.208 --> 22:09.750
-What a surprise.
-So, this is yours, Big Rider.

22:12.916 --> 22:16.041
I'm appalled! I love this plot twist!
Total shock!

22:16.125 --> 22:17.041
What the hell?

22:17.125 --> 22:18.750
And the second slice

22:18.833 --> 22:21.708
goes to a girl like no other.

22:21.791 --> 22:24.291
A very stubborn girl, you know, Catarina?

22:27.375 --> 22:30.500
This is for backing everyone up
here today,

22:30.583 --> 22:33.333
and I maybe even like you a little bit.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.750
-Oh, girl!
-Who knows?

22:36.458 --> 22:37.291
Thanks.

22:37.375 --> 22:41.833
Moving on with our celebration,
let's change the plaque at the front desk.

22:41.916 --> 22:43.250
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

22:43.333 --> 22:45.458
-Wow!
-Look at this!

22:45.541 --> 22:48.000
Everybody watched you evolve, Catarina.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.791
-Congrats.
-Thank you! That's unexpected!

22:50.875 --> 22:52.083
It's my first job!

22:53.583 --> 22:55.958
You'll always be in my heart, seriously!

22:56.041 --> 22:58.208
-Congratulations!
-I'm happy for you!

22:58.291 --> 22:59.166
Thank you.

22:59.708 --> 23:02.250
-Who wants to eat? Go get the plates.
-I do.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.333
Catarina.

23:04.458 --> 23:05.541
Want some, Miguel?

23:07.416 --> 23:09.583
Well, congratulations.

23:09.666 --> 23:10.958
You deserve it.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.166
Thought I'd argue with you
because of a guy?

23:15.791 --> 23:16.625
Yes.

23:18.291 --> 23:19.375
You earned it.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.166
Thanks, Marília!

23:41.208 --> 23:43.458
Helena? What are you doing here?

23:43.541 --> 23:46.458
Léo, I'm having weird cravings,

23:46.541 --> 23:48.541
I'm exactly on my fertile window,

23:48.625 --> 23:50.333
and I'm feeling sick.

23:50.416 --> 23:53.500
I'm almost sure I'm pregnant,
and it's yours.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.791
So, you're pregnant after one day?

23:55.875 --> 23:57.791
Yes, I'm pregnant. It was nice,

23:57.875 --> 24:01.166
but I don't remember using a condom.
It's driving me crazy.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.750
Relax, we used it.

24:02.833 --> 24:05.000
And if we hadn't…

24:05.083 --> 24:06.791
Thank God, we used it.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.833
This feels better than sex.

24:09.958 --> 24:10.958
Phew!

24:11.041 --> 24:14.000
No. I didn't mean it was bad.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.916
-It was good, right?
-Yeah.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.958
What did you mean by "If we hadn't"?

24:20.041 --> 24:22.583
I don't know if you remember, but--

24:23.416 --> 24:25.833
-I didn't-- You know?
-Say it, Léo!

24:27.083 --> 24:31.500
We were doing it,
and I just couldn't finish.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.375
So, you can't be pregnant.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.791
-Got it?
-Yes, I got it.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.208
-Obviously.
-No, wait!

24:38.291 --> 24:40.708
-What do you mean?
-It's obvious to me.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.166
-Helena--
-I'm still in 5th grade.

24:44.875 --> 24:48.125
No, Helena, come back! Wait!

25:16.750 --> 25:18.125
SAT RESULTS SOON
HOLD ON

25:19.458 --> 25:21.416
SOCIAL SCIENCES
JOURNALISM COURSE

25:32.666 --> 25:34.458
What happened, Dimas?

25:37.750 --> 25:40.541
The boat was his bread and butter.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.750
We gotta do something.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.291
-I was thinking--
-Yasmin, wait.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.541
We can't confront Elias.

25:51.041 --> 25:55.000
-Dimas lost his boat for doing it.
-What? Why are you afraid of him?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.125
I don't know.

25:59.833 --> 26:03.875
Sometimes, it seems I care
more about your home than you do.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.250
I live here.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.791
I know how things work.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.208
This was never a summer adventure to me.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.416
Good luck tonight.

26:30.583 --> 26:35.041
Guys, Miguel is still shaken
about Conrado's leave.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.625
We should let him cool down.

26:39.041 --> 26:42.416
But we can't let Elias think
he owns this island.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.250
So? Who's with me?

26:51.416 --> 26:52.250
Huh?

26:55.500 --> 26:56.458
-I am.
-I am.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.458
-Me too.
-Yeah.

26:58.541 --> 27:00.375
Let's show them who's the boss.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.583
Oops!

27:13.333 --> 27:15.375
Excuse me, I have to work.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.583
I know you don't wanna talk,

27:19.083 --> 27:22.000
but I know what's like
to run away from problems,

27:22.833 --> 27:23.875
from who we are.

27:25.291 --> 27:28.250
I've spent my life
hiding behind superficial stuff.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.583
Do you want your card back?

27:31.125 --> 27:32.333
Too late. I destroyed it.

27:32.416 --> 27:35.625
No. Please, listen to me.
I'm here for you.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.208
This is hurting you. Can't you see?

27:42.458 --> 27:45.708
What I see
is that you're confusing things.

27:45.791 --> 27:48.208
I'm your mentor. You're not mine, okay?

27:48.791 --> 27:50.500
But I'm here as your friend.

27:51.125 --> 27:52.541
Because I worry about you.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.750
That's what friends do, right?

27:58.041 --> 27:59.250
I learned this here.

28:03.291 --> 28:04.166
Trust me.

28:07.625 --> 28:08.458
Trust me.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.333
-What are you doing?
-Surprise.

28:30.083 --> 28:30.916
Come on.

28:32.458 --> 28:33.291
Follow me.

28:42.666 --> 28:43.666
-Ready?
-Yeah.

29:07.750 --> 29:08.666
<i>Diego…</i>

29:42.958 --> 29:44.125
Thank you, friend.

29:53.916 --> 29:56.000
Almost every time I'm down there,

29:57.750 --> 29:58.750
he shows up.

29:59.666 --> 30:00.541
Your brother?

30:04.791 --> 30:07.916
We were at a college party,
I was a senior.

30:09.833 --> 30:12.958
He drank too much,
went for a swim and drowned.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.791
I could've done something.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.833
I could've saved his life.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.083
Diego,

30:30.333 --> 30:32.916
I can't even imagine how hard this is.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.666
But I'm here.

30:38.291 --> 30:39.291
I'm with you.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.250
<i>Y ahora, muchacho,</i>

30:44.333 --> 30:47.958
let's go. You have to rest
to ace your test.

30:49.000 --> 30:49.833
Come on.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.208
Let's go!

31:43.291 --> 31:45.291
-Come on.
-Let's go!

31:47.833 --> 31:48.666
Catarina.

31:49.500 --> 31:50.333
Let's go.

31:53.666 --> 31:55.166
Are you okay, Rodrigo?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.166
Okay.

32:04.833 --> 32:07.875
Yasmin, you're a beast!

32:07.958 --> 32:10.708
I'm glad to know this is a compliment.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.666
Guys, who's thirsty?

32:13.750 --> 32:15.250
Yeah!

32:16.791 --> 32:18.833
Since everybody's here,

32:18.916 --> 32:22.916
I need to tell you that I passed the test
to be a lifeguard!

32:23.916 --> 32:25.083
No way!

32:25.583 --> 32:26.541
Congratulations!

32:28.000 --> 32:29.125
That's amazing!

32:29.208 --> 32:30.916
Let's drink to that!

32:33.625 --> 32:36.458
Congrats! But you're not leaving
the hotel, are you?

32:36.541 --> 32:40.791
No. It's just part-time,
and I'll be at the beach.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.166
I talked to Vilma. It's all settled.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.083
-Congrats!
-Congratulations.

32:46.125 --> 32:46.958
Thanks.

32:47.041 --> 32:50.958
Guys, since we're announcing good news,

32:51.041 --> 32:52.791
I also have one.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.666
I was admitted to college.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
-Shut up! Oh my God!
-Congratulations!

33:04.791 --> 33:08.250
So, when are you going?
Can we go visit you?

33:08.333 --> 33:10.833
-I don't know.
-Did you just learn it?

33:10.916 --> 33:13.208
-Awesome!
-I've always wanted to visit Rio.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.333
Miguel?

33:21.958 --> 33:24.291
Hey, why are you so quiet?

33:28.583 --> 33:30.375
Hey, wait up.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.375
I don't know how to thank you
for what you did for me.

33:38.500 --> 33:39.833
Yes, you do.

33:41.416 --> 33:42.333
I do.

33:53.416 --> 33:54.375
I guess…

33:57.500 --> 33:59.666
it's time I showed you a beautiful view.

34:00.916 --> 34:02.125
Come.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.250
Come with me.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.916
Close your eyes and watch your step.

34:21.666 --> 34:23.666
-Where is it?
-Right here.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.500
Wow, it is really beautiful.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.875
-And this is--
-Yeah.

34:35.375 --> 34:36.583
I'll extract the oil

34:36.666 --> 34:39.916
from this ganja
for my dad's Parkinson's treatment.

34:42.375 --> 34:45.750
So, besides making drinks
and telling jokes,

34:45.833 --> 34:47.666
you have other talents too?

34:54.208 --> 34:55.208
Hey.

34:55.791 --> 34:56.750
Are you okay?

34:58.916 --> 35:01.416
-Yeah.
-You can tell me.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.541
Yasmin, I…

35:05.541 --> 35:08.291
-I don't wanna lose you now that--
-"Now that?"

35:11.708 --> 35:13.791
Now that I'm in love with you.

35:17.291 --> 35:18.458
What is this place?

36:53.500 --> 36:54.791
Where are you going?

36:55.708 --> 36:56.625
I have to go.

36:57.166 --> 36:59.541
Where? To the lodge?

37:01.333 --> 37:03.208
Let's say I'm going to my room.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.333
Why don't you stay?

37:06.458 --> 37:07.291
No.

37:07.958 --> 37:08.791
I need to go.

37:10.625 --> 37:11.750
But I'll be back.

37:41.875 --> 37:42.708
<i>What is it?</i>

37:49.166 --> 37:51.500
If someone said, a month ago,

37:52.333 --> 37:55.208
that I'd fall in love
with my party's waiter,

37:56.375 --> 37:57.708
I wouldn't believe it.

38:03.916 --> 38:04.916
Are you thirsty?

38:22.000 --> 38:22.833
Diego.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.083
Have you rented this place for me?

38:29.333 --> 38:30.333
Why?

38:41.375 --> 38:42.666
<i>That's me.</i>

38:42.750 --> 38:45.750
<i>Paula Cristina Souza e Silva.</i>

38:47.375 --> 38:48.333
<i>Yes.</i>

38:51.083 --> 38:52.791
I'd like to file a complaint.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.000
Credit card theft.

38:58.125 --> 38:58.958
Yes.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.833
Exactly.

39:05.583 --> 39:07.541
Actually, this apartment is mine.

39:08.833 --> 39:09.958
It's my family's.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.000
I'm glad you're here.

39:24.041 --> 39:26.333
<i>I'm sorry? Oh, right.</i>

39:26.416 --> 39:28.541
<i>Yes, the jewelry store's purchase.</i>

39:28.625 --> 39:31.500
<i>I've just noticed it,</i>
<i>but I know where it was.</i>

39:32.791 --> 39:36.041
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>It must've been where I'm staying.</i>

39:36.916 --> 39:38.458
<i>The Maresia Hotel.</i>
