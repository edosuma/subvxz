WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:09.879
Ah.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.638
Has the Mayor arrived?

00:29.812 --> 00:31.379
In the chapel,
with the Bishop.

00:31.553 --> 00:32.684
No shooting, right?
That was our deal.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.077
That's our deal.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.679
Give it to me.
The relic! Now!

01:10.853 --> 01:13.899
Please, this is not what
God wants for your lives.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.945
Idolators know nothing
of what God wants.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.864
You can't!
It's sacred!

01:22.038 --> 01:24.345
It is sacred, which is why
it needs to be destroyed!

01:37.923 --> 01:40.187
The investor
will come through.
Do not worry.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.624
- I'm not worried.
- I know how these
money men work.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.191
If he didn't say no,
it means yes.

01:44.365 --> 01:45.670
Soon he will hand you
a big check,

01:45.844 --> 01:48.151
and everyone
will buy your fancy
new security system.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.414
It's a security
software suite.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.764
Whatever.
Everyone will buy it.

01:52.938 --> 01:56.246
Soon you can forget
about all these
lost years of your life.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.813
The FBI can find
a new desk clerk.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.336
Hush, Hashem.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.860
Aram can't talk
about his work.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.037
But I'm sure
it's important,

02:05.212 --> 02:08.215
even if it does
wash out his complexion.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.955
How do you like
being back at work, <i>motek?</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:12.219
It's weird. I, uh...

02:12.393 --> 02:14.612
I thought I'd closed the door
on this part of my life,

02:14.786 --> 02:16.440
but, um, it's great
to see the team,

02:16.614 --> 02:18.181
and, uh,
a paycheck doesn't hurt.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.662
Paychecks are the shackles
of the common man.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.577
Remember that.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.492
Just wait till you're
running your own company.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.886
Ooh! Maybe you'll be
on <i>Shark Tank!</i>

02:28.060 --> 02:30.454
I gotta go.
Um...

02:30.628 --> 02:32.848
Thank you,
uh, for breakfast.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.937
I will call you guys.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.634
Talk to you soon.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.376
Do not worry.
The money, it will come!

02:39.550 --> 02:41.030
Not worried!

02:41.204 --> 02:43.119
Have you
thought about this?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.469
She's 11.
You're a fugitive.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.690
Yes, but she
doesn't know that.
She wouldn't see that.

02:48.864 --> 02:52.868
Children see behavior,
good or bad,
kind or cruel.

02:53.042 --> 02:57.046
I'm confident
Agnes will see me.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.181
I won't lie to her.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.444
Do you let her believe
in Santa Claus?

03:03.618 --> 03:04.662
I let her believe in myths.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.403
Well, if the shoe fits.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.754
I want to be in her life.

03:14.237 --> 03:17.197
I know it's hard
and that you mean well.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.373
Let me talk to Charlene.
I'll see what she says.

03:23.377 --> 03:27.424
What do you know about
the Supremo Priori Knighthood?

03:27.598 --> 03:28.469
Never heard of 'em.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.471
I'm not surprised.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.865
For generations,
they've been a rather

03:34.039 --> 03:36.955
toothless group
of religious extremists.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.435
And you're telling me
about them

03:38.609 --> 03:40.350
because that's
no longer the case.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.570
They recently killed
an innocent man

03:42.744 --> 03:46.530
during the armed robbery
of the Sacra Cintola.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.750
Mary's Holy Belt?

03:48.924 --> 03:51.535
Another in a growing list
of stolen iconography

03:51.709 --> 03:54.582
that they've put on
the illicit auction block.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.889
The belt will soon
be available
to the highest bidder.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.891
When and where
is the auction?

04:00.065 --> 04:02.851
Mmm. Let me worry
about that.

04:03.025 --> 04:06.333
I suggest you do
some homework
on the SPK,

04:06.507 --> 04:10.380
be prepared for
whatever comes.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.556
Mohammed's footprint
from Istanbul.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.167
The Buddha's tooth
from Sri Lanka.

04:15.342 --> 04:18.432
In Cologne, Germany,
bones belonging to
the Three Wise Men.

04:18.606 --> 04:22.914
All stolen by the SPK
then, according to Reddington,
sold on the black market.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.395
No way. I mean, those things
aren't real, right?

04:25.569 --> 04:27.397
Authenticity is irrelevant.

04:27.571 --> 04:30.661
Belief makes them real,
and holy.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.925
Initially, the SPK operated
like thieves in the night,
but they've turned violent.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.363
Two days ago,
they killed a security guard

04:36.537 --> 04:38.408
inside a cathedral
in Prato, Italy,

04:38.582 --> 04:41.150
during the armed robbery
of a 2,000-year-old belt

04:41.324 --> 04:44.109
- worn by the Virgin Mary.
- Allegedly.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.852
So, did Reddington say
what turned a secret society
into armed robbers?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.419
<i>Not what, but who.</i>

04:49.593 --> 04:52.379
<i>A new leader
known only as Giovanni.</i>

04:52.553 --> 04:54.250
<i>If these
are true believers,
I'd think they'd want</i>

04:54.424 --> 04:57.035
<i>to possess the relics,
not auction them off.</i>

04:57.209 --> 04:58.559
<i>As usual,
two plus two equals five.</i>

05:00.735 --> 05:03.128
What's Reddington
not telling us?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.565
I don't know.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.002
Don't know or won't say?

05:07.176 --> 05:10.092
Agent Ressler,
that'll be enough.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.356
No, I'm sorry, but Dembe
didn't just work
for Reddington.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.054
He was his sworn protector,
his closest friend.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.709
And now we're supposed
to just, what, accept him
as one of ours?

05:18.883 --> 05:20.885
Until he gives us
a reason not to, yes.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.585
Agent Zuma,
you and Agent Mojtabi

05:24.759 --> 05:26.587
will go to the cathedral
in Prato.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.371
Vatican authorities
have agreed to share

05:28.545 --> 05:29.633
what they've found
at the crime scene.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.375
You two
be careful out there.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.464
Your FBI reinstatements
won't be official

05:34.638 --> 05:36.597
until Health Services
administers a drug test.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.076
I took mine last week.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.600
I'll have them
arrange yours next.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.645
On, uh, that note,
you should know that I met

05:41.819 --> 05:43.995
with an angel investor
about my company,

05:44.169 --> 05:48.870
and, well, uh, shockingly,
he might be interested.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.741
So you're leaving us for
the private sector again.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.700
Appreciate you mentioning it.

05:52.874 --> 05:56.225
If it happens, I'll support
whatever decision you make.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.358
Until then,
let's take down the SPK.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.972
This is where the thieves
entered and stabbed
the guard.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.104
Antonio was
found dead here.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.585
No CCTV cameras.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.022
I have stills
from the crime scene.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.502
Is this door keyed
on the outside?

06:12.676 --> 06:14.635
No. It can only be
opened from inside.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.898
We're operating on a theory
that a member of their crew

06:17.072 --> 06:18.203
was already
in the building.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.727
I believe you're right,

06:19.901 --> 06:21.598
and that crew member
was your own guard.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.035
His weapon
is still holstered.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.647
If he felt threatened,
it wouldn't be.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.389
If our guard was
helping the intruders,

06:29.563 --> 06:30.999
why would they kill him?

06:31.173 --> 06:32.957
Hard to say.
Things go wrong.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.220
If your guard
was the inside man,

06:35.395 --> 06:38.136
there may be a money trail
we can follow back
to the SPK.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.487
I'll see what I can find
in his financial records.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.968
Remember,
you're not an agent.

06:44.142 --> 06:47.015
In case something happens,
leave the fun stuff to me.

06:47.189 --> 06:50.279
You got a weird
definition of fun.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.151
David Kangas?

06:53.325 --> 06:54.762
That's right.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.547
Agent Park, FBI.
I'd like to speak
to you

06:57.721 --> 06:59.723
about a financial
transaction you made

06:59.897 --> 07:01.899
wiring 50,000 euros
to a man in Italy.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.205
I'm a business manager.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.815
My firm moves
all kinds of money.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.774
I don't remember
each transaction,

07:06.948 --> 07:08.515
but if you'd like
to visit my office...

07:08.689 --> 07:10.473
Well, maybe we can
prompt your memory.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.301
Antonio Lucchese
was a guard

07:12.475 --> 07:14.564
for the Santa Maria
de Prato Cathedral.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.479
We have reason to believe
the money you transferred

07:16.653 --> 07:18.568
was payment for his role
in an armed robbery.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.091
Well, I can guarantee
I have no knowledge

07:20.265 --> 07:21.310
of any criminal activity.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.007
We're not
suggesting you do,

07:23.181 --> 07:24.574
but maybe one
of your clients does.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.881
Have you ever heard of
an organization called
the SPK?

07:28.926 --> 07:30.667
Whoa!

07:30.841 --> 07:32.539
Stop! Stop!

07:38.632 --> 07:40.808
Kangas! Get out here!

07:40.982 --> 07:43.027
Worthy is the Lamb
who was slain! I am worthy!

07:43.201 --> 07:44.594
Geez. Are you
having fun yet?

07:44.768 --> 07:46.248
Honor and glory
are mine!

07:46.422 --> 07:48.250
Mine!

07:55.910 --> 07:58.347
Do I hear 650?
Last chance to own

07:58.521 --> 08:02.438
your own ZPU-2
twin-barrel antiaircraft gun.

08:02.612 --> 08:06.442
No one can run, or fly
from you when you are
sitting in this bad boy.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.314
Shock and awe your friends
and enemies alike.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.448
Going once? Twice?

08:12.622 --> 08:16.452
Sold to the lady in red
for $600,000!

08:16.626 --> 08:19.020
May your revenge be as daring
as your neckline.

08:20.891 --> 08:24.286
And now, a Galilean
fashion accessory

08:24.460 --> 08:27.202
once worn by
the O.G. Madonna herself.

08:27.376 --> 08:31.249
I give you
the Sacra Cintola.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.557
Nothing says heavenly style
like a camel-hair belt

08:34.731 --> 08:37.647
encased in gold, silver,
and rock crystal.

08:37.821 --> 08:41.259
The bidding commences
at $2 million.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.567
I have two. I have three.
Thank you, sir.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.222
Four? Can I get four?

08:47.396 --> 08:50.878
I have four. Do I hear five?

08:51.052 --> 08:54.621
The Virgin Mary was riding
a tractor beam up to God

08:54.795 --> 08:56.274
when she dropped this beauty.

08:56.448 --> 08:59.843
It is a bargain at $4 million.
How about 4.5?

09:00.017 --> 09:01.323
Five if you close
the bidding now.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.368
Sold to the gentlemen!

09:07.111 --> 09:10.201
Your funds cleared.
Congratulations.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.117
You are now the proud owner
of biblical history.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.776
Actually, Mother Mary's
chastity belt is
of no interest to me.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.473
I only bought the heirloom

09:21.648 --> 09:23.563
to gain access
to something that is.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.652
The name of the client

09:25.826 --> 09:28.959
who entrusted you
with the Sacra Cintola.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.613
I'm sure you can
appreciate the need

09:30.787 --> 09:32.049
for complete
confidentiality.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.225
I can,
which is why I brought

09:34.399 --> 09:36.750
this, uh, bauble
for your auction.

09:45.802 --> 09:46.847
Is this...

09:47.021 --> 09:49.240
One of the seven.

09:49.414 --> 09:53.418
Selling it would offset
my latest expenditure.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.596
More to the point,
your cut of the sale

09:56.770 --> 09:59.903
would be, mmm,
well, low seven figures.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.079
If I give you the name.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.691
Well, and arrange for
a meeting between us.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.216
That's not how
I conduct business.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.784
Mmm.

10:10.958 --> 10:14.875
Trevor, I'm not leaving here
without the meeting.

10:15.049 --> 10:18.356
You can either profit
from giving it to me,

10:18.530 --> 10:20.663
or get hurt
then give it to me.

10:23.884 --> 10:27.888
David was
a wonderful husband,
a kind father.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.717
He was very normal.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.936
So what happened
to him?

10:33.110 --> 10:35.199
The Supremo Priori
Knighthood.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.941
David said
they're a fraternity,
like the Shriners.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.161
I thought it would
be good for him,

10:40.335 --> 10:42.337
fellowship with Christian men.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.860
How could I know
it was a cult?

10:44.034 --> 10:45.993
A cult.
What do you mean?

10:46.167 --> 10:49.300
I mean a religious devotion
to a manipulative leader

10:49.474 --> 10:52.347
who turned my husband
into a martyr.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.044
Did he tell you
where they met?

10:54.218 --> 10:56.264
No, but when
his behavior changed,

10:56.438 --> 10:58.396
I started tracking
his cellphone.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.747
I'd do anything
to catch the madman

11:00.921 --> 11:02.313
who did this
to my husband.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.971
Wake up!
Wake up!

11:08.145 --> 11:11.366
Biblical prophecies
are unfolding before
our very eyes.

11:11.540 --> 11:14.543
Oceans rising,
rivers receding,

11:14.717 --> 11:16.632
the whole damn Earth's
on fire.

11:16.806 --> 11:21.071
Yet we await a Second Coming
that has not come.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.291
Why?

11:23.465 --> 11:25.772
Because people are too busy
worshipping the past

11:25.946 --> 11:28.209
to see what's happening
right now.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.820
Only through the destruction
of their ancient idols

11:30.994 --> 11:33.605
are we able
to open their eyes

11:33.780 --> 11:35.738
so they may see their way
to the kingdom of heaven.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.045
Amen. Amen.

11:38.219 --> 11:42.092
But in order to do that,
we must be welcome.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.443
The senseless murder of that
poor security guard in Italy

11:45.617 --> 11:47.924
set our cause
back immeasurably.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.883
And he was one of us.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.668
He contributed to
the furtherance of our cause.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.888
And you killed him.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.542
Shame on you.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.850
Death and violence are not
the way to righteous change.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.460
Then what is the way,
Giovanni?

12:02.634 --> 12:04.549
We keep destroying
their relics,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.029
and they just
keep covering it up.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.857
Be patient,
Brother Colfax.

12:08.031 --> 12:08.989
Our message will get out
eventually.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.034
It's out right now.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.341
The press is <i>finally
talking about us.</i>

12:13.515 --> 12:14.429
It's time
to make a real move.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.300
Like what?

12:16.474 --> 12:17.998
Let's not steal
from another church.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.521
Let's take down a church.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.352
That's enough!

12:24.526 --> 12:27.398
There will be
no more violence.
Do you understand?

12:27.572 --> 12:30.445
We must all aspire
to be more like

12:30.619 --> 12:32.926
John the Baptist,

12:33.100 --> 12:37.147
who peacefully paved the way
for the return of the Messiah.

12:37.321 --> 12:41.543
And that is why,
as an inspiration,

12:41.717 --> 12:43.588
I have chosen
as our next target,

12:46.722 --> 12:49.116
the head of John the Baptist.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.771
It is to be venerated
at the Old Holy Cross Church

12:51.945 --> 12:53.207
tomorrow afternoon.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.427
Now I think
it's time for all of us

12:56.601 --> 12:58.690
to take a moment or two
of reflection.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.128
Everyone take a breather,
stretch your legs,

13:01.302 --> 13:03.783
and when I return,
I'll share with you

13:03.957 --> 13:05.785
how I plan to steal that head.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.662
Yeah. How much did we get
for this one?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.620
Double the appraisal price.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.361
Which is why
I'm sending my colleague

13:17.535 --> 13:19.102
to transfer your funds
in person.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.365
Can you meet him
tomorrow for lunch?

13:21.539 --> 13:24.325
Can you assure me
of his discretion? <i>I promise.</i>

13:24.499 --> 13:26.501
<i>The man I'm sending won't
speak of this to anyone.</i>

13:26.675 --> 13:28.416
Thank you.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.381
Well, didn't this just
get way more interesting.

13:40.645 --> 13:43.953
The meek and scheming
Robert Vesco,

13:44.127 --> 13:46.782
masquerading as the great
and powerful Giovanni.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.917
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.310
What is your most
expensive wine?

13:53.484 --> 13:58.098
We have a Chateau
le Pin Pomeral 2001,
which is $5,800.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.535
Yes. We'll take two.
On his tab.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.450
Which is $50 million
in arrears.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.281
So, the scam.

14:07.455 --> 14:08.978
Tell me about it.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.861
Hey. Ready to brief
the team?

14:22.035 --> 14:24.472
Yeah, soon as I give
Health Services what
they're here for.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.517
Shouldn't be hard.
You drank half the Potomac.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.997
Well, I did
a little research.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.869
I think I found where
Kangas goes at night.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.656
What?
I like to hydrate.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.441
You know,
gingers tend to wrinkle.

14:39.052 --> 14:42.838
Oh. You have no idea
how hard it is

14:43.012 --> 14:44.840
to manage
a decent heist crew.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.537
The bickering,
the squabbling...

14:46.711 --> 14:48.975
The fragile egos,
the safe-cracker

14:49.149 --> 14:52.674
who feels like he's worth more
than the gadget guy.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.242
Who thinks he's much smarter
than the mastermind.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.853
Who just wants to go back
to the salad days
of being a driver.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.550
- Hmm.
- But you, Robert,

14:59.724 --> 15:02.205
instead of teaching criminals
to be brothers,

15:02.379 --> 15:05.208
you turned a fraternity
of brothers into criminals.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.688
Hmm. Hmm.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.212
How did you con them
into stealing for you?

15:09.386 --> 15:10.735
Profit sharing?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.695
No. Storytelling.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.566
They want
the end of the world.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.047
I simply pour fuel
on their fantasies.

15:18.221 --> 15:21.964
Train them to connect
holy relics with idolatry.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.271
They believe
that what we steal
is burned at the altar.

15:24.445 --> 15:27.404
But you perform a little
sleight of hand.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.581
Ah, foot, actually,
which preserves the relics,

15:30.755 --> 15:32.932
<i>and then I sell them
at auction.</i>

15:33.106 --> 15:36.283
Your own secret society.
Where can I get one?

15:36.457 --> 15:39.329
You must teach me
the secret handshake.

15:39.503 --> 15:44.552
Hmm. Well,
I won't deny it has
been comically lucrative.

15:44.726 --> 15:47.947
But it hasn't been
all fun and games.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.166
The security guard
at the cathedral.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.735
Yes, I know, I know.
That poor man.

15:53.909 --> 15:57.608
I've never used violence
in pursuit of illicit gain.

15:57.782 --> 16:01.699
But I should've been there
to keep my boys in check.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.572
But to tell you
the truth, at my age,
after a long flight,

16:04.746 --> 16:07.836
my ankles tend to
swell up like balloons,
and I'm useless.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.882
I would suggest
compression socks.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.276
I'd also suggest you shut down
this con, Robert,

16:13.450 --> 16:14.582
while you still can.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.714
Ooh, I'm way ahead
of you, Raymond.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.499
I've already decided
to cut bait,

16:18.673 --> 16:19.935
right after they steal
that head.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.285
And if another body drops?

16:22.459 --> 16:25.506
Not to worry.
I've laid down the law.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.509
I've got my boys
under control.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.773
Each IED contains
a main charge,
an arming switch,

16:31.947 --> 16:34.254
and a battery pack connected
to a RC receiver.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.169
What's going on here?

16:36.343 --> 16:38.258
You heard Giovanni.
He doesn't want this.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.303
Giovanni doesn't seem
to know what he wants.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.739
When do you plan
to detonate these?

16:41.913 --> 16:43.567
At the end of mass
today.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.917
When the bishop raises
the head of John the Baptist,

16:46.092 --> 16:48.398
we'll blast open
the gates of heaven
for all the world to see.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.487
You're gonna blow these
with people in the church?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.837
The Bible's full of
judgment and bloodshed.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.535
Everyone who dies
will die for a cause.

16:54.709 --> 16:55.623
Giovanni needs
- to know about this.
- Wait.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.154
<i>Well, I've enjoyed
catching up, Raymond,</i>

17:05.328 --> 17:07.504
but now I must really go
and tend to my flock.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.419
Your flock can wait.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.247
We have
unfinished business.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.162
Are you talking about
that little

17:13.336 --> 17:15.338
De La Cruz job
a few years back?

17:15.512 --> 17:17.123
"Little De La Cruz job"?

17:17.297 --> 17:20.604
That was 100 million
in Spanish gold,

17:20.778 --> 17:24.391
and you blew town
like a Texas twister
with all of it.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.697
Is this where you tell me
about honor among thieves?

17:26.871 --> 17:29.918
No, it's where I tell you that
you're going to pay your debt.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.964
Well, in order to do that,

17:33.139 --> 17:35.663
I would have to go
to my bank in Malta,

17:35.837 --> 17:38.753
and, well, to approve
a transfer of that size...

17:38.927 --> 17:40.624
Perfect.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.105
While I don't have a secret
society, I do have a jet.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.976
We're going to Malta.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.848
You didn't even know
I'd be here.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.372
You're right.
I have changed.

17:49.546 --> 17:53.463
I used to think that
I had to create my own fate.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.466
Now I believe in karma.
Even if it is a bitch.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.602
Remove any outer garments
that might conceal items

18:01.776 --> 18:04.213
that could tamper
your urine sample.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.477
Anything else in your pants
pockets goes in the bowl.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.218
Uh, I know you're
just doing your job,

18:09.392 --> 18:11.568
but, uh, FYI,
we've both been agents.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.222
We're not gonna cheat.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.442
Void directly
into the container.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.966
Do not flush afterwards.
You have four minutes.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.712
Okay. Here we go.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.757
It's funny.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.240
This is awkward.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.199
Knew I should've had, uh,
more to drink today.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.071
I just, I feel like
I've been retaining
a lot of water lately.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.117
Feeling, um, bloated.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.206
♪ <i>Money, money♪</i>

18:40.380 --> 18:42.251
Okay. Uh, that's my phone.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.427
Um, I know the, uh,
the ringtone is embarrassing,

18:44.601 --> 18:45.907
but at this moment,
uh, what isn't?

18:46.081 --> 18:47.778
Uh, uh, I need to answer it.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.258
No personal items
in the stall.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.304
It's kind of important.
Uh, can you...

18:51.478 --> 18:53.349
Can you just
pick it up, please,
and put it on speaker?

18:53.523 --> 18:55.090
I can't miss this call.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.268
<i>We did it!</i>

18:59.442 --> 19:01.792
No way. He said yes?
The money came through?

19:01.966 --> 19:03.359
<i>We've got
a company, baby!</i>

19:03.533 --> 19:06.928
Oh, my...
Oh, my God. Oh.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.539
<i>Whatever you're doing
right now, drop it.</i>

19:09.713 --> 19:12.542
Trust me.
I would if I could.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.109
<i>The angel investor said yes.</i>

19:14.283 --> 19:16.546
Aram's on his way
to tech fame and fortune.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.940
That's great news.
Congratulations.

19:19.114 --> 19:22.248
There are still
I's to be dotted
and T's to be crossed,

19:22.422 --> 19:25.555
but, yeah, it is, uh,
kind of, kind of exciting.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.428
But I am not going anywhere
just yet.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.386
Well, later, we'll celebrate
and figure out a way

19:30.560 --> 19:32.388
to help you
spend your money.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.130
Now we need to focus.
Where are we on SPK?

19:35.304 --> 19:37.524
The burn victim's wife
couldn't give us
anything concrete,

19:37.698 --> 19:39.787
but she was worried enough
about her husband's behavior

19:39.961 --> 19:42.311
to start tracking his phone
when he went out at night.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.921
He always parked
in the same public lot,

19:44.095 --> 19:45.706
then he'd turn off
his phone.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.534
Generic buildings.
No conspicuous occupants,

19:47.708 --> 19:49.275
at least not now.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.102
This is the same block
in 1868,

19:51.277 --> 19:53.192
the same year
that the SPK was founded.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.237
One of these
three buildings remains.

19:55.411 --> 19:59.720
And what it was, and still is,
an American Legion Hall.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.549
So, do you have any groups
that, uh, meet here
on a regular basis?

20:02.723 --> 20:05.552
Uh, yeah, you mean
The... The Arthritics.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.032
A senior
heavy-metal band.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.513
I don't...
I don't care much
for their, uh, sounds,

20:10.687 --> 20:12.167
but, um...

20:12.341 --> 20:15.518
I'll let you boys
look around. Okay.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.477
Sure doesn't look like
the home base

20:17.651 --> 20:21.742
for some heavily armed
religious extremists.

20:21.916 --> 20:25.006
Maybe they are hiding
in plain sight.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.965
Hmm. Something you know
a little about, huh?

20:33.014 --> 20:35.234
This mirror

20:35.408 --> 20:39.368
is a reproduction
of the Porta Magica.

20:39.542 --> 20:42.632
A monument built in 1680
in Piazza Vittorio.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.069
So?

20:45.244 --> 20:50.031
So, the "Magic Portal"
isn't a mirror.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.860
It's a door.

20:53.034 --> 20:56.037
They say alchemists used it
to vanish from our world.

21:08.745 --> 21:09.833
Reddington teach you
that trick?

21:10.007 --> 21:11.618
Yes.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.533
He showed me the real
Porta Magica in Rome

21:13.707 --> 21:14.925
and told me the story.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.579
Well, he taught you well.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.929
I wish I knew if he was
still teaching you.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.976
And I wish I knew
when you'll believe me
when I say he's not.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.866
The SPK's next target?

21:47.784 --> 21:49.438
Blueprints for IEDs.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.746
And a floor plan.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.620
Old Holy Cross Church.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.364
Call an ambulance.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.335
Peace be with you.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.424
And also with you,
Father.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.563
I'll tell
you what, Raymond.

22:27.737 --> 22:30.697
If we skip Malta,
I'll deal you in
on a little plan

22:30.871 --> 22:32.873
I've hatched
worth 10 times as much.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.006
You deal from the bottom
of the deck, Robert.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.399
I do.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.401
<i>Senor</i> Cooper.

22:39.575 --> 22:40.837
Thank you.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.100
Harold.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.841
<i>So you've spoken
with Charlene.</i>

22:45.015 --> 22:48.628
I have, and I got her to agree
to let you see Agnes.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.369
- Wonderful.
- As long as I'm present.

22:54.068 --> 22:57.463
"Present."
Present how?

22:57.637 --> 22:59.508
She won't agree to let you
and Agnes be alone together.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.641
She wants the visits
to be supervised.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.513
I'm not an abusive husband
or father.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.950
No, you're
a cold-hearted murderer.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.910
I know what Agnes
means to you,
and I'm trying here,

23:10.084 --> 23:12.521
but this is the best
I can do.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.610
I appreciate it, Harold,
and I'll consider it.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.091
I have news about
the Sacra Cintola.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.919
<i>For once,
I'm ahead of you.</i>

23:19.093 --> 23:20.486
Savoring the moment
will have to wait.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.966
We know what the SPK's
next move is.

23:25.578 --> 23:28.232
You said you had your flock
under control.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.756
I do.

23:29.930 --> 23:33.890
They're about to blow up
a church on live TV.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.283
I don't believe it.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.241
Well, belief
is your problem, Robert.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.808
Or the lack of it.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.897
It's why you didn't
see this coming.

23:41.071 --> 23:44.335
Well,
in my defense,

23:44.510 --> 23:46.337
it's very difficult
to maintain good judgment

23:46.512 --> 23:49.079
when your followers think
you're channeling God.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.777
What am I going
to do, Raymond?

23:50.951 --> 23:52.648
I've never lost control
of a con before.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.911
Stay calm.

23:55.085 --> 23:58.349
Happens to the best of us.
Or so I'm told.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.177
A church full
of innocent people.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.832
No, I can't bear to have
that stain on my soul.

24:03.006 --> 24:06.053
What do you know of the plan?
Is there a staging area?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.707
Yes, I scouted one
for them.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.753
Well, then that's
where we're going.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.842
The church
is full of people.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.888
The service was already
under way when you called.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.543
We've initiated
a lockdown but held off
on emergency evac.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.284
Good. The bombers
are watching
a live broadcast.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.112
We don't want
to alert them
that we're here.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.418
Why don't we just
cut the feed?

24:23.592 --> 24:26.247
The moment we do that,
they'll blow the church.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.423
According to their notes,
we have until
the bishop raises

24:28.597 --> 24:30.860
John the Baptist's head
to save these people.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.820
Give to the king
thy judgment, O God,

24:33.994 --> 24:36.779
and to the king's son
thy justice...

24:36.953 --> 24:39.434
<i>I looked over the
schematics from the SPK base,</i>

24:39.608 --> 24:41.828
<i>and it looks like they've
rigged IEDs with RF triggers</i>

24:42.002 --> 24:43.264
<i>and hidden them
under the pews.</i>

24:43.438 --> 24:44.961
<i>Now, if I can get
a close look at one</i>

24:45.135 --> 24:46.876
<i>and determine its frequency,</i>

24:47.050 --> 24:48.878
<i>I should be able to jam
the remote signal.</i>

24:49.052 --> 24:52.578
...upon the fleece as showers
falling gently upon the earth.

24:52.752 --> 24:56.538
In his days shall justice
spring up an abundance
of peace

24:56.712 --> 24:58.627
until the moon be taken away.

24:58.801 --> 25:02.022
And he shall rule
from sea to sea,

25:02.196 --> 25:04.590
and from the river
unto the ends of the Earth.

25:12.423 --> 25:13.686
Son of a bitch.

25:17.472 --> 25:20.693
Hey, Ressler,
you're never gonna believe
what I just found.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.217
So, I saw one of the IEDs,
but I can't get close enough

25:23.391 --> 25:25.393
to determine its RF output
without creating a scene.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.134
There's just, too many
live TV cameras.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.092
Robert Vesco.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.617
The, uh, wanted fugitive
who faked his own death
in Cuba.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.227
He was one of Reddington's
friends, wasn't he?

25:33.401 --> 25:34.750
He was. Why?

25:34.924 --> 25:36.665
Because, based on
all the fingerprints

25:36.839 --> 25:39.407
all over the SPK altar,
that's who Giovanni is.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.888
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

25:42.062 --> 25:43.933
Vesco is a con man,
not a killer.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.196
Reddington once sent us
to find Vesco, remember?

25:46.370 --> 25:47.894
And once we did,
you and your boss

25:48.068 --> 25:49.678
helped him get away
with a fortune in gold.

25:49.852 --> 25:52.768
Yes. Raymond did con you,
but then Vesco conned him.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.643
Maybe that's why he gave us
this case. As payback.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.296
Or maybe he gave it to us
to help his old pal again.

25:59.470 --> 26:00.863
Yeah, but if we have
his prints,

26:01.037 --> 26:02.082
so does everyone
in law enforcement.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.692
How can that possibly
help him?

26:03.866 --> 26:05.999
I don't know. I was hoping
you could answer that.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.175
I can't,
and I don't have time
to make you believe me.

26:08.349 --> 26:11.265
Aram, I can get you
a closer look at those
IEDs. Follow me.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.925
Just go in there
and talk them down.

26:19.099 --> 26:22.363
I really think this is
more your area than mine.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.626
Can't you just... Shoot them for you?

26:24.800 --> 26:27.934
No. I can't.
There's a bomb, Robert!

26:28.108 --> 26:30.197
If I walk in,
they'll set it off.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.633
What if they won't
listen to me?

26:35.463 --> 26:37.813
You are Robert Vesco,

26:37.987 --> 26:40.990
king of the con.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.864
A swindling, cheating,
double-crossing,

26:45.038 --> 26:46.430
beautiful confidence man.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.518
Well...

26:50.652 --> 26:52.959
So put
your game face on

26:53.133 --> 26:55.178
and get your damn marks
under control.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.010
Thank you, Raymond.
I needed that.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.446
You're welcome.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.492
Uh, Robert... Mmm?

27:04.666 --> 27:05.928
...if you try
to run out on me again,

27:06.102 --> 27:08.322
I'll put you down
like a three-legged mule.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.546
<i>This is the Lamb of God</i>

27:15.721 --> 27:17.505
<i>who takes away
the sins of the world.</i>

27:17.679 --> 27:20.073
Get ready, boys.
Any minute now.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.554
What's going on in here?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.556
Giovanni.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.384
You're just in time
for the fireworks.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.778
You directly disobeyed
my orders!

27:29.952 --> 27:32.041
On the contrary.
We're doing what
you taught us.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.217
We're paving the way
for the Second Coming.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.176
Our goal was
to prepare believers

27:36.350 --> 27:39.440
by turning them <i>away
from material objects,</i>

27:39.614 --> 27:42.573
to open their hearts and minds
to our spiritual nature.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.271
How does mass murder
accomplish that?

27:44.445 --> 27:47.709
<i>Fear accomplishes that.</i>

27:47.883 --> 27:49.972
Then you should be down
on your knees for
fear of me, son.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.540
Now give me
- that detonator.
- No.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.716
You're gonna see
we're right, Giovanni.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.849
We're gonna show you.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.546
Well, if you do,
I'll just go to
the police.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.505
Really? Because I just heard
an APB on a police scanner.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.030
Giovanni isn't Giovanni.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.773
His real name is Robert Vesco,
a fugitive wanted by the FBI.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.043
- We're running out of time.
- Which is why we need it.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.306
An offering bag?
There's a bomb
in the church,

28:19.480 --> 28:20.611
and you want
an offering bag.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.309
Trust us. Please.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.922
This should work.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.532
There's only one way
to find out.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.751
Thank you.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.671
Harold Cooper.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.281
Harold,
I've been thinking about

28:38.455 --> 28:41.110
your proposal
regarding Agnes.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.851
Now's not a good time
for this.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.462
Because of the church bombing?
That's being taken care of.

28:45.636 --> 28:48.030
Not at the church it's not.
The pews are full.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.684
The bombs are live,
and we haven't diffused them.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.252
The detonator's
at an off-site location.

28:52.426 --> 28:54.036
I've spoken to Giovanni.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.473
<i>He's there now working
to resolve the situation.</i>

28:56.647 --> 28:59.085
I know Giovanni is Vesco,
so forgive me

28:59.259 --> 29:00.956
<i>for not taking solace
in knowing he's on the case.</i>

29:01.130 --> 29:02.566
You and who else?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.220
Know about Vesco?
Everyone.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.701
<i>His prints were found.
We put out an APB.</i>

29:09.269 --> 29:14.709
<i>♪ Lord God almighty♪</i>

29:14.883 --> 29:17.277
<i>♪ Early in the morning ♪</i>

29:17.451 --> 29:20.149
They'll bring
out the head next,
right after the offering.

29:20.323 --> 29:23.849
Please. Call this off.
You're doing it all
for nothing.

29:24.023 --> 29:27.287
Can't you see that?
You were just marks in a con.

29:27.461 --> 29:30.812
What con?

29:30.986 --> 29:34.294
If all your talk about
the End Times was just talk,

29:34.468 --> 29:37.297
if you don't believe
worshipping the past
is killing the future,

29:37.471 --> 29:40.517
then why were
we stealing relics
for you to destroy?

29:40.691 --> 29:43.694
Because he doesn't
destroy them.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.828
He sells
your precious antiquities

29:47.002 --> 29:48.961
for a fortune
on the black market.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.527
Who are you?

29:50.701 --> 29:53.704
Hmm. I'm many things
to many people.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.533
To Robert here,
I'm a creditor,

29:56.707 --> 29:59.188
who very much
needs him alive.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.582
To a man of the cloth
such as yourself,

30:01.756 --> 30:04.454
I'm Yama, god of death.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.635
Okay.
This is the aisle.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.942
The IED I saw should be

30:14.116 --> 30:16.292
about four feet from
where you're standing.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.686
<i>I don't see it,
but I know it's there.</i>

30:18.860 --> 30:21.732
<i>You gotta be close.</i>

30:21.907 --> 30:23.865
Stop, stop!
Right there. I see it.

30:26.650 --> 30:29.828
Whoever you are,
you're wrong.
We burn the relics.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.046
We destroy them.

30:44.103 --> 30:46.540
His judgment will come.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.107
But today

30:48.281 --> 30:50.936
is your judgment day.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.548
I'm not an End Timer
by nature,

30:54.722 --> 30:58.639
and my idea
of rapture is, of late,
a bit more solipsistic.

30:58.813 --> 31:02.730
But no matter what floats
one's funereal boat,

31:02.904 --> 31:07.126
you will be judged by what
you do in the next 60 seconds.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.215
<i>Now for the blessing</i>

31:09.389 --> 31:11.957
<i>of the holy relic
of Saint John the Baptist!</i>

31:12.131 --> 31:14.089
We're out of time.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.004
Okay. I got a pic
of the RC receiver.

31:16.178 --> 31:20.400
I just need to match
its markings to its frequency.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.142
If you <i>are
the god of death,</i>

31:23.316 --> 31:25.579
our guns shouldn't
be able to hurt you.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.494
There's only one way
to find out.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.155
Not yet.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.940
You can take me after.
Not before.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.943
May Almighty God
bless this relic.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.814
Okay. There. I found
the frequency. I found it.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.124
<i>In the name
of the Father, the Son,</i>

31:49.298 --> 31:52.388
<i>and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

31:59.134 --> 32:02.181
Raymond.
You saved me.

32:02.355 --> 32:04.618
You're <i>way</i> past saving.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.576
I preserved you.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.405
An act of
pure selfishness.

32:09.579 --> 32:12.539
Come. If we leave now,
we'll be in Malta
before sunup.

32:12.713 --> 32:15.281
Still stuck on Malta?

32:15.455 --> 32:17.587
I'm telling you, Raymond,
we'll find much bigger action

32:17.761 --> 32:19.589
with the Salton Sea!

32:19.763 --> 32:22.157
Somebody's prayers were
answered. Or wasn't.

32:22.331 --> 32:25.030
Uh, depending on
what you do
or don't believe.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.683
Personally, I-I lean
towards the idea that,

32:26.857 --> 32:29.121
Wu Xing.
You remember him?

32:29.295 --> 32:32.037
Of course. That...
That was my first case.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.910
I remember thinking,
"Who is this

32:36.084 --> 32:38.304
"weird guy and why
does he talk so much?"

32:38.478 --> 32:40.306
Oh, that's a,
that's a nervous tic,
actually.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.222
I've been doing it
as long as I can remember.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.354
I just start going,
you know, and, uh...

32:45.528 --> 32:47.443
You know, I was trying to
work my way up
to a compliment.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.750
Oh. Sorry.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.581
You forgot what it was,
didn't you? I do that
all the time.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.626
If I think of something
and I don't say it right away,

32:56.800 --> 32:58.498
it's, uh...
It's gone.

32:58.672 --> 33:01.544
I... Oh. Dang.
Um, sorry. Again.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.546
It's okay.

33:03.720 --> 33:07.811
'Cause whatever
this is, this whole
Aram-a-palooza thing,

33:07.986 --> 33:09.552
I'm gonna miss it.

33:12.207 --> 33:13.382
Lithium?

33:13.556 --> 33:14.601
Yes, lithium.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.777
And the Salton Sea's
full of it.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.214
With all these electric cars,
there simply isn't
enough of it.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.260
Until now.

33:21.434 --> 33:22.739
Robert Vesco.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.829
I'm Special Agent
Dembe Zuma, FBI.

33:26.004 --> 33:26.961
You're under arrest.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.925
I understand.
You're new on the job.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.319
You want to impress.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.756
But there are
other factors at play.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.150
Fifty million factors,
as I recall.

33:42.324 --> 33:46.154
And the SPK members
that he helped me to secure.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.417
They're in a warehouse
near the church.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.812
It's a bit messy inside,
but in fairness,

33:51.986 --> 33:55.076
they did pull
their weapons first, so...

33:55.250 --> 33:57.905
I knew you'd help him escape.
So he could get you
your money.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.689
Naturally.
I get my money,

33:59.863 --> 34:03.041
the FBI saves
a church full of people.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.086
I'll even throw in
the Sacra Cintola

34:05.260 --> 34:06.479
to sweeten the deal.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.872
It's good business
for all.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.093
And if Vesco slips away?
Oh, well.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.878
Nobody in the FBI
will be any the wiser.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.358
I'm the FBI.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.972
Yes. You're an FBI agent.

34:22.147 --> 34:26.151
But loyalty, that's
something else entirely.

34:26.325 --> 34:28.153
It is.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.677
And mine is constantly
being questioned.

34:30.851 --> 34:33.767
Because your feet are planted
in two different worlds.

34:33.941 --> 34:36.117
They're not.

34:36.291 --> 34:38.511
But I'm having a hard time
convincing anyone of that.

34:41.775 --> 34:45.474
And arresting Robert
will convince them?

34:45.648 --> 34:47.694
Mmm. Arresting me?

34:47.868 --> 34:50.088
I'm a small fish
compared to this shark.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.580
I'm sorry, Robert.

35:10.978 --> 35:13.372
You're my friend.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.462
This, what I'm doing here,

35:16.636 --> 35:18.681
I consider
an act of friendship.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.645
You don't see it now.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.821
I hope someday
that you will.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.115
So, is it true?

36:01.289 --> 36:04.466
Heard you took him
off Reddington's jet.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.165
If we offer him a deal,
he'll identify SPK members

36:07.339 --> 36:09.297
and those who bought
the stolen relics.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.039
But is it true?

36:12.213 --> 36:14.476
I'm not auditioning for
your approval or your trust.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.404
♪ <i>Money, money ♪</i>

36:29.578 --> 36:31.450
♪ <i>I just can't get enough ♪</i>

36:31.624 --> 36:33.278
♪ <i>Money, money ♪</i>

36:33.452 --> 36:34.409
♪ <i>I just can't ge...♪</i>

36:36.498 --> 36:38.065
Hey. <i>Where the heck are you?</i>

36:38.239 --> 36:40.807
I'm, um, stuck at work.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.939
<i>I told you the investor
would come through.</i>

36:43.113 --> 36:44.245
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

36:44.419 --> 36:45.855
Yeah, <i>Baba,</i> you told me.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.770
<i>Nick showed us
the check!</i>

36:47.944 --> 36:49.685
<i>I didn't know a check
could fit so many zeroes!</i>

36:49.859 --> 36:51.426
<i>I know these money men.</i>

36:51.600 --> 36:53.602
<i>He didn't say no.
He was going to say yes.</i>

36:53.776 --> 36:55.865
<i>Welcome to
the one percent, pal.</i>

36:56.039 --> 36:58.520
<i>Your days
as a desk clerk
are officially over.</i>

37:02.176 --> 37:03.917
Did Cooper find you?

37:04.091 --> 37:05.875
What does he want?

37:06.049 --> 37:08.878
Your drug test came back.
A diluted negative.

37:09.052 --> 37:11.098
What does that mean?

37:11.272 --> 37:12.665
We both know
the answer to that.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.886
- Did I pass or not?
- Neither.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.759
So you have to retake it,
under even closer supervision,

37:19.933 --> 37:21.543
which means
you can't use this.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.636
You don't know what
you're talking about.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.030
Unfortunately for you,
I know exactly
what I'm talking about.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.771
I'm a child of an addict.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.468
I know the tricks
of the trade,
how eye drops

37:33.642 --> 37:35.427
can throw off
a urine sample,

37:35.601 --> 37:38.386
how sucking down water
can render the results
meaningless.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.041
- Did you tell Cooper?
- I didn't.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.086
Because I think
you need this job.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.089
You're good at it,
and it keeps you
on the straight and narrow.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.005
I want you to have
your badge back.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.181
But now I have the power to
make sure that never happens,

37:51.356 --> 37:53.880
and I'll use it
unless you clean up.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.634
Aram. I thought
you'd be out
celebrating.

38:08.808 --> 38:11.158
I, um,
I saw my parents,

38:11.332 --> 38:13.552
and my, uh,
my business partner, Nick.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.815
They must be so happy
and proud of you.

38:15.989 --> 38:19.993
We did good work today.
At the church.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.821
We saved a lot of people.

38:21.995 --> 38:24.127
Yes. It was a good day.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.913
We've got a lot of those.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.393
Days where we help people.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.873
Why are you here?

38:31.047 --> 38:34.181
It's late.
Everyone's gone home.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.705
Your ship has come in,
and yet here you are.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.752
I had my business partner
buy me out.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.668
It, um, wasn't much.

38:42.842 --> 38:46.236
Uh, enough for a new kitchen.
Mom's been wanting one.

38:46.411 --> 38:49.022
And I made Nick create
a camp scholarship
in my name.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.459
Space Camp. I was 12.

38:51.633 --> 38:55.158
It, um,
It changed my life.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.509
There won't always
be good days.

38:57.683 --> 39:00.033
I know.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.340
And, uh,

39:02.514 --> 39:05.212
on those, I may regret
my choice, but...

39:07.606 --> 39:09.651
Not much.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.871
And on the good days,
I, uh...

39:15.657 --> 39:17.572
I can't think
of anywhere else
I'd rather be.

39:17.746 --> 39:20.227
That sounds like
a reason to celebrate.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.011
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.404
Thanks,
but if it's okay,

39:23.578 --> 39:25.406
I think I'd like
to just hang out here.

39:26.581 --> 39:27.843
Of course.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.421
The belt worn
by the Virgin Mary.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.513
I'm speechless.
If you weren't,

39:45.687 --> 39:49.430
you would be if I told you
what the damn thing cost me.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.998
Aren't you
the least bit awestruck?

39:52.172 --> 39:55.001
I appreciate the object's
place in history

39:55.175 --> 39:57.786
but not the reverence
for it.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.788
In that,
I agree with Giovanni.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.703
Getting lost in the past

40:01.877 --> 40:04.489
distracts us from
the work of the present.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.229
I still have a hard time
believing you didn't know

40:06.404 --> 40:08.144
Vesco was Giovanni.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.755
Lucky coincidence.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.671
Or unlucky, seeing as
he's going to prison

40:12.845 --> 40:14.412
and taking a fortune
of mine with him.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.066
He had a long run.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.287
I doubt we've heard
the last of Robert Vesco.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.768
Who knows?

40:22.942 --> 40:25.031
If I get bored,
maybe I'll break him out.

40:25.205 --> 40:28.077
I'd love to best him
one last time.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.166
And you wonder why
Charlene insists on

40:30.340 --> 40:31.472
supervised visitation.

40:33.996 --> 40:36.564
Have you decided
whether you can abide
by our visitation terms?

40:38.914 --> 40:40.742
As a matter of survival,

40:40.916 --> 40:43.266
I make it a point
to only enter spaces

40:43.441 --> 40:45.573
whose borders I define.

40:48.184 --> 40:51.057
But if spending time
with Agnes

40:51.231 --> 40:53.189
requires submitting
to borders

40:53.363 --> 40:55.583
defined by you and Charlene,
so be it.

40:55.757 --> 40:58.194
I don't like it,
but the alternative
is far worse.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.501
Agreed.
I'll go get her.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.548
Now? Go get Agnes
right now?

41:03.722 --> 41:06.594
Why not?
You've waited two years.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.727
There's no point
in keeping you
waiting any longer.

41:21.653 --> 41:24.090
You look fine.

41:24.264 --> 41:26.832
You met him
a long time ago.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.311
He was a close friend
of your mother's,

41:28.486 --> 41:30.705
and he's very excited
to see you.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.059
Hi.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.586
Hi.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.197
You probably
don't remember me.

41:44.371 --> 41:46.591
I remember you.

41:46.765 --> 41:49.811
We sailed boats together
in Central Park.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.596
And we got fruit pops.

41:51.770 --> 41:55.774
Yes!
That's right.

41:55.948 --> 41:59.212
That was the day before
the day my mother died.

42:06.393 --> 42:07.437
You're Pinky.

42:10.919 --> 42:12.094
Yes.

42:14.009 --> 42:15.620
I'm Pinky.
