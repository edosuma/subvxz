17:58.000 --> 17:59.670
BARRY. BARRY!

17:59.740 --> 18:02.370
AND WHAT, MAY I ASK,
WAS ALL THAT ABOUT?

18:05.440 --> 18:08.640
OH, I... I WAS WORKING
OUT A CHARLEY HORSE.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.580
YEAH, I WAS, UH...

18:12.650 --> 18:13.980
JUST WORKING IT OUT.

18:14.050 --> 18:15.980
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

18:16.050 --> 18:19.450
THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT
YOU AND YOUR DAD TO MEET.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.660
IF HE LIKES YOU

18:21.720 --> 18:23.220
MAYBE HE'LL TEACH YOU
MARTIAL ARTS.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.630
NOBODY LIKES ME. WHY WOULD HE?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.600
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.870
<i>MAYBE BECAUSE</i>
<i>HE'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOU.</i>

18:34.940 --> 18:36.200
MAY I HELP YOU?

18:36.270 --> 18:38.440
YOU CAN HELP
EVERYBODY HERE.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.710
TELL THAT CHINK
TO DOUSE THAT CIGAR.

18:40.770 --> 18:43.070
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO SMOKE IN HERE.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.210
YES, OF COURSE YOU ARE RIGHT.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.210
SINCE WE ARE ALL SO SIMILAR

18:47.280 --> 18:49.050
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME

18:49.120 --> 18:51.950
WHICH PARTICULAR CHINK
YOU ARE REFERRING TO?

18:52.020 --> 18:54.820
THE GEEZER IN FRONT
OF YOU,<i> CHARLIE.</i>

18:56.360 --> 18:57.520
EXCUSE ME.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.540

19:19.610 --> 19:22.210
BY THE WAY,
MY NAME IS NOT CHARLIE.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.510
HUH?

19:23.580 --> 19:24.580
HMM.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.920
(<i> sniffing</i> )

19:25.980 --> 19:28.180
SMOKE.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.020
SMOKING.

19:30.090 --> 19:31.390
I'M SMOKING?

19:31.460 --> 19:33.590
I'M SMOKING?!
I'M SMOKING!

19:33.660 --> 19:36.230
GET THIS THING OFF ME.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.930
(<i> man shouting</i> )

19:39.000 --> 19:42.270
THIS IS MY FAVORITE JACKET!

19:42.330 --> 19:44.070
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i>

19:46.710 --> 19:48.270
WHAT'S THIS?

19:48.340 --> 19:51.440
THAT'S HOW WE TEACH CHILDREN
TO USE CHOPSTICKS.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.940
OKAY.

19:54.010 --> 19:56.050
I GET THE POINT.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.020
SEE, IF THEY HAD
POINTS ON THEM

20:00.080 --> 20:01.980
YOU COULD
JUST STAB IT.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.420
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

20:05.490 --> 20:07.560
I WANTED TO IMPRESS
YOUR UNCLE.

20:07.630 --> 20:10.190
DID YOU NOTICE
HE STOPPED USING HIS

20:10.260 --> 20:11.560
HALFWAY THROUGH
THE MEAL?

20:11.630 --> 20:12.560
HE DID?

20:12.630 --> 20:14.100
HE REALLY LIKES YOU.

20:14.170 --> 20:16.270
HE'S VERY IMPRESSED

20:16.330 --> 20:17.530
WITH YOUR WORK
WITH COMPUTERS.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.270
ARE YOU ALMOST FINISHED

20:19.340 --> 20:20.800
WITH YOUR PROGRAM?

20:20.870 --> 20:22.940
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

20:23.010 --> 20:23.940
YOUR SON.

20:24.010 --> 20:24.940
OH.

20:25.010 --> 20:27.440
HE'S TOLD ME A LOT
ABOUT YOU.

20:27.510 --> 20:29.710
HE HASN'T TOLD ME
MUCH ABOUT YOU.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.380
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

20:32.450 --> 20:34.520
WELL...

20:34.590 --> 20:36.380
MY FATHER BUILT
THIS RESTAURANT.

20:36.450 --> 20:37.890
HE CAME HERE FIRST.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.890
EIGHT YEARS LATER
HE SENT FOR MY MOTHER.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.360
SO YOU GREW UP AROUND HERE THEN?

20:43.430 --> 20:46.390
YES. THEY WORKED HERE TOGETHER.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.230
THEN MY FATHER DIED.

20:48.300 --> 20:52.400
MY MOTHER RAN THE PLACE HERSELF
FOR A WHILE

20:52.470 --> 20:56.570
BUT THEN, TWO YEARS AGO,
HE SENT FOR HER AGAIN.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.480
NOW IT'S ALL I HAVE LEFT
OF THEM.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.740
AND YOUR UNCLE?

21:05.520 --> 21:06.980
DEAR UNCLE...

21:07.050 --> 21:11.490
<i>A POET AND A CHARMER,</i>
<i>TEACHER AND PHILOSOPHER.</i>

21:14.820 --> 21:17.720
THAT IS THE NINTH TIME.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.730
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.730
I WASN'T READY.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.070
THAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT
OF THIS EXERCISE.

21:25.130 --> 21:26.930
YOU MUST <i> ALWAYS</i> BE READY.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.270
AND YOU--

21:28.340 --> 21:30.640
YOU WANT TO BE
A MARTIAL ARTIST.

21:30.710 --> 21:34.010
AND WHAT WOULD BE
YOUR FIGHTING NAME?

21:34.080 --> 21:35.770
HMM...

21:35.840 --> 21:38.810
BARRY THE LEOPARD.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.380
NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:40.450 --> 21:41.610
NOT QUITE RIGHT.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.780
UH...

21:43.850 --> 21:46.190
BARRY THE <i> TIGER,</i>
WHO FIGHTS

21:46.250 --> 21:50.360
WITH COURAGE AND RELIES
ON INSTINCT.

21:50.430 --> 21:51.560
NO.

21:51.630 --> 21:53.860
THAT WON'T DO.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.700
HMM.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.570
I HAVE IT. I'VE GOT IT.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.630
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

22:03.070 --> 22:06.670
MR. DUMPLING.

22:08.810 --> 22:12.280
MR. DUMPLING, WHO FIGHTS
IN A MOST DECEPTIVE MANNER

22:12.350 --> 22:15.110
BY SMASHING THE FISTS
OF HIS OPPONENTS

22:15.180 --> 22:16.580
WITH HIS OWN FACE.

22:16.650 --> 22:18.550
UH, MR. E...

22:18.620 --> 22:23.090
MR. DUMPLING NEVER ATTACKS

22:23.160 --> 22:27.060
BECAUSE HE DOES NOT SURVIVE
TO ATTACK...

22:28.500 --> 22:31.760
...BECAUSE HE IS NEVER READY.

22:31.830 --> 22:34.100
OKAY, I GET THE POINT, MR. LEE.

22:34.170 --> 22:35.230
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.500
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

22:36.570 --> 22:39.440
I WILL HELP YOU LEARN
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.800
ONCE YOU STOP

22:40.870 --> 22:43.570
WANTING TO LEARN,
I WILL STOP TEACHING.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.480
I DON'T WANT TO STOP LEARNING.

22:45.540 --> 22:49.310
NEVER INTERRUPT
YOUR TEACHER.

22:49.380 --> 22:50.710
THIS, FOR EXAMPLE

22:50.780 --> 22:52.150
IS A THIEF.

22:52.220 --> 22:55.320
YOU CANNOT COMPROMISE
WITH A THIEF

22:55.390 --> 22:57.620
UNLESS YOU WISH TO GIVE

22:57.690 --> 22:59.490
SOMETHING
OF YOURSELF AWAY.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.520
DOES THAT APPEAR
CONFUSING?

23:01.590 --> 23:04.260
YES.

23:04.330 --> 23:05.530
GOOD.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.900
LIFE IS VERY CONFUSING.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.030
AND THAT IS YOUR FIRST LESSON.

23:11.100 --> 23:14.300
I MARRIED THE FIRST GIRL
I TOOK OUT.

23:14.370 --> 23:17.040
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN GONE?

23:19.210 --> 23:22.080
SHE PASSED AWAY
ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO.

23:24.750 --> 23:27.620
YOU SURE BARRY IS GOING TO BE
OKAY WITH YOUR UNCLE?

23:27.680 --> 23:30.320
OH, MY UNCLE
WILL BEHAVE HIMSELF.

23:30.390 --> 23:31.450
IF HE DOESN'T

23:31.520 --> 23:33.860
I'LL BREAK HIS ARM.

23:33.930 --> 23:36.090
MORE TEA?

23:36.160 --> 23:38.060
YEAH.

23:38.130 --> 23:40.500
HOW FAR IS YOUR SCHOOL
FROM YOUR HOUSE?

23:40.560 --> 23:43.870
ABOUT, UH, FIVE, TEN MINUTES.

23:43.930 --> 23:45.630
NOT HOW LONG. HOW FAR?

23:45.700 --> 23:46.870
OH. TWO MILES.

23:46.940 --> 23:48.540
HOW DO YOU GET THERE?

23:48.610 --> 23:51.040
MY DAD DROPS ME OFF
IN THE MORNING

23:51.110 --> 23:54.340
PICKS ME UP IN THE AFTERNOON
OR I GET A RIDE.

23:54.410 --> 23:56.540
NOW YOU WILL WALK
TO SCHOOL--

23:56.610 --> 23:57.810
UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.350
THEN YOU WILL RUN.

23:59.420 --> 24:03.280
WE WILL SEE IF THAT
IS A THIEF OR A CRUTCH.

24:04.450 --> 24:05.890
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

24:05.960 --> 24:06.890
YES?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.820
THERE'S A PROBLEM
OUT HERE.

24:08.890 --> 24:11.530
WHERE'S THAT LITTLE GAL,
GRUB?

24:11.590 --> 24:14.530
GRUB-- THAT IS THE NAME,
AIN'T IT?

24:14.600 --> 24:17.030
IT'S GAB... GABREWSKI.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.600
GA... GA... GA...

24:19.940 --> 24:21.640
GABREWSKI!

24:25.840 --> 24:27.740
IT'S A FUNNY NAME.

24:27.810 --> 24:28.610
IT IS A FUNNY NAME.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.480
GRUB'S BETTER,
AIN'T IT, BOYS?

24:34.550 --> 24:35.680
YEAH.
YEAH.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.820
RIGHT, GUYS?

24:37.890 --> 24:40.650

GRUB! GRUB! GRUB! GRUB!

24:43.420 --> 24:44.420
WHAT'S YOUR...

24:44.490 --> 24:45.620
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

24:45.690 --> 24:47.430
HANK.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.860
IT'S SHORT FOR HENRY.

24:49.930 --> 24:52.600
OH, YEAH. I HAD AN UNCLE
NAMED HENRY ONE TIME.

24:52.670 --> 24:55.030
YEAH? I DON'T THINK
I KNEW HIM.

24:55.100 --> 24:58.270
LET ME DEAL WITH THEM.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.210
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:00.270 --> 25:02.010
PREPARING.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.340
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL FOR YOU.

25:05.410 --> 25:08.010
WE'RE GOING TO REMODEL
THIS PLACE.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.120
WE'LL TAKE

25:09.180 --> 25:11.120
THAT WALL OVER THERE

25:11.180 --> 25:12.580
AND PUT IT HERE.

25:12.650 --> 25:14.890
THAT WALL WILL BE BACK

25:14.960 --> 25:16.390
OVER HERE.

25:16.460 --> 25:20.690
AND I THINK THE KITCHEN WILL BE
ALL THE WAY IN THE FRONT.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.260

THE FRONT?

25:22.330 --> 25:24.630
FIRST THING
WE'RE GOING TO DO

25:24.700 --> 25:27.600
IS WE'RE GOING TO START

THESE GENTLEMEN ONLY SAW
WHAT I <i> APPEARED</i> TO BE.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.260
LESSON NUMBER TWO:

27:04.330 --> 27:06.990

NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

45:16.670 --> 45:19.340
YES. THAT'S HOW I KNOW
WHEN IT'S READY.

45:19.410 --> 45:21.840
IT IS AN OLD REMEDY

45:21.910 --> 45:25.550
WITH SOME OF MY
SECRET INGREDIENTS.

45:25.750 --> 45:29.220
BREATHE IN THE FUMES.

45:29.280 --> 45:31.250
DEEPLY.

45:32.690 --> 45:34.390
GOOD.

45:34.460 --> 45:36.490

45:46.600 --> 45:48.230
WHAT IS IT?

45:48.300 --> 45:49.900
YOU MUST BREATHE.

45:49.970 --> 45:51.840
THE HEAT WILL NOT BURN YOU.

45:51.910 --> 45:53.410
IT WILL HELP.

45:53.470 --> 45:55.810
RELAX.

45:58.610 --> 46:01.880
YOU WERE PERHAPS OVERZEALOUS.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.770
THE OBJECT IS NOT

47:34.840 --> 47:36.440
TO HURT SOMEBODY ELSE.

47:36.510 --> 47:38.940
IT IS TO STOP THEM
FROM HURTING YOU.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.440
YOU MUST RESPECT THE WOOD.

49:33.080 --> 49:35.020
THEN NOBODY DRINK PEPSI-COLA.

49:35.090 --> 49:36.290
PEPSI HAS NOTHING

YOU GO HOME NOW.
