I reserved it way in advance
to make sure

Gorpley, what are you
doing here?

Of course, we believe it,

finding this cabin?

and kills all three of us

he was captured

06:18.745 --> 06:20.681
it took half the National Guard.

07:31.718 --> 07:35.956
I don’t know why we have to have
a cabin so far from Sam Gorpley?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.058
You know, this can
only mean one thing.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.827
Larry’s going to try to trick me
into kissing him again.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.462
‐Eww!
‐Eww!

Look, cousin, a toaster.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.005
Wow.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.611

07:57.644 --> 07:59.880
It just wouldn’t be Friday
without toast.

Well, I like my Friday toast
as much you do, Balki.

‐But I want him.
‐He’s mine.

‐I want him.
‐Girls, please.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.792
This same thing happened
once on Mypos.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.961
It was right
after the great cucumber famine.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.197
Or was it the tomato famine?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.365
Maybe it was the great
persimmon famine.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.003
Or maybe...
Many thanks.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.741
Now, look, if you’re really
worried, we’ll lock the door.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.110

10:10.143 --> 10:11.845

has a key in it.

I hope there’s two of him.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.910
Let me handle this.

out of this, Sam.

12:47.233 --> 12:50.303
Yep, and that’s pretty much
what happened.

12:50.336 --> 12:53.006
Then we called the police
and you guys showed up.

12:55.509 --> 12:59.479
Mr. Gorpley, I cannot believe
what you said about me.

12:59.513 --> 13:02.282
You know that I never,
under any circumstances

13:02.315 --> 13:05.418
would use bingi bingi
in a dependent clause.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.222
Officer, I’m Larry Appleton

13:09.255 --> 13:11.825
investigative reporter
from "The Chicago Chronicle."

13:11.858 --> 13:14.494
If you want an objective,
unbiased account

13:14.528 --> 13:16.897
I think I’m the man
to give it to you.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.332
[indistinct chattering]

13:19.365 --> 13:21.367
Hey, hey.
Come on, come on.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.837
You’re overreacting.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.540
Mad Dog is probably
nowhere near here.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.510
Cousin Larry’s right...
as usual.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.380
Lead us, cousin,
and we will follow.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.486
Well, I’m locking the door
just in case.

13:40.521 --> 13:43.123
Fine. Lock the door
if it will make you feel better.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.226
I’ll start dinner and
by the time the steaks are done

13:46.259 --> 13:48.829
you’ll all realize
how silly you’re being.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.231
That’s my cousin.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.200
Hey, is it any wonder
I love the guy?

13:57.270 --> 13:58.605
[all screaming]

14:07.080 --> 14:09.415
Larry, didn’t you see him?
That was Mad Dog Kraus.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.552
Calm yourself, Jennifer.
I saw him.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.219
This is nothing I can’t handle.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.923
I bet he has a plan.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.458
You have a plan,
don’t you, cousin?

14:18.491 --> 14:22.028
Oh, do you, Appleton? Do you,
do you? Oh, say you have a plan.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.197
Of course, he has a plan.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.432
Share it with us, cousin.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.536
Ladies, in the closet.
Gentlemen, prepare for battle.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.640
Not you, Gorpley.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.346
Cousin, what are you doing?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.282
I’m just getting him back
for that story he told.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.187
[pounding on door]

14:48.021 --> 14:48.955
Come on.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.993
Now, when I give the word,
we’ll jump him.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.460
Good plan, Appleton.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.097
Good plan? Good plan?

15:01.101 --> 15:03.136
I’ll have you know
it’s a brilliant plan.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.509
It’s my privilege to witness
his genius each and everyday.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.714
Balki, please.
Napoleon was a genius.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.316
I’m just a simple man
of great courage.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.019
[screams]

15:21.454 --> 15:24.725
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.961
Here. Here. Here’s money.
Take it. Take it all.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.329
And there’s, uh,
women in the closet.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.603
Balki, looks like
it’s just you and me.

15:36.637 --> 15:37.938
Sorry, I got you into this,
buddy.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.508
Oh, cousin, there’s so much I
want to say and so little time.

15:41.542 --> 15:43.710
Uh, Mad Dog,
could you give us a moment?

15:43.744 --> 15:45.011
Sure.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.753
If I have to die,
this is the way I want to go.

15:52.786 --> 15:56.256
Fighting at the side
of the bravest man I know.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.359
I kiss the ground you walk on.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.695
‐Did you just walk right there?
‐Yes, I did.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.201
‐Di you, did you walk here?
‐Yes, I did.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.640
Alright, uh, Come on, come on,
Balki, come on, come on.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.177
We’ve got a job to do.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.345
Mad Dog, proceed.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.446
Eeyah!

16:22.482 --> 16:25.552
Alright, I was hoping
I wouldn’t have to do this.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.120
Wakaa!

16:30.423 --> 16:33.093
Let him go. I know karate.

16:34.528 --> 16:37.163
Big deal. Ha!
Urgh!

16:37.197 --> 16:40.000
Oh, cousin, I don’t know
how much longer I can endure.

16:41.702 --> 16:43.570
Alright, I warned you.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.172
Hyah!

16:48.408 --> 16:49.576
Wakaaa!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.146
Hyah! Hyah!

17:04.525 --> 17:06.627
Cousin, I don’t think
you hurt him.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.194
Oh, no?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.295
[snaps finger]

17:23.510 --> 17:25.377
Larry, take me.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.589
I like my version better.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.291
Hey, I just told it
the way it happened.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.226
Is there anyone here
that can tell me what happened

17:40.260 --> 17:42.462
without turning himself
into Indiana Jones?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.131
(Jennifer and Mary Anne)
Balki.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.601
Balki, could you tell me
what happened?

17:47.634 --> 17:50.604
Start at the very beginning.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.807
Well, uh, that would be
about four years ago

17:53.840 --> 17:55.742
when I first decided
to come to America.

17:55.776 --> 17:57.578
Sir, sir, sir.

17:57.611 --> 18:00.346
Could you skip ahead
to when Kraus came in?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.649
Oh, uh, alright.

18:02.683 --> 18:04.150
But you’re gonna,
you’re gonna miss hearing

18:04.184 --> 18:06.119
about the first time
I had Mexican food.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.759
Jennifer and Mary Anne
were hiding in the closet

18:12.793 --> 18:14.628
when Mad Dog opened the door.

18:16.797 --> 18:19.499
I’m gonna kill you.

18:20.701 --> 18:22.268
Uh, he seemed upset.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.340
Mr. Gorpley went to make sure
that Jennifer and Mary Anne

18:27.373 --> 18:28.875
were still safe
in the closet.

18:28.909 --> 18:30.243
[screaming]

18:33.947 --> 18:36.316
Uh, l‐look, uh,
now that you’re here

18:36.349 --> 18:37.851
why‐why‐why don’t you
just leave?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.653
And‐and we won’t tell
anyone that we saw you.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.855
Cousin, cousin,
we‐we couldn’t do that.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.290
That would be lying.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.894
However, I do have a‐a‐a couple
of Myposian stories

18:47.928 --> 18:51.331
that apply to this situation.
W‐would you like to hear them?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.666
‐No.
‐No.

18:55.836 --> 18:58.471
‐Uh, let him go.
‐Why?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.874
Well‐well, uh...

19:00.907 --> 19:02.743
I know karate.

19:02.776 --> 19:03.844
Ha!

19:05.646 --> 19:07.180
Hyah!

19:11.852 --> 19:15.355
Okay, I think
I’ll kill you first.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.393
Phakaaa!

19:27.233 --> 19:28.268
Oh!

19:29.670 --> 19:31.204
[grunting]

19:49.523 --> 19:50.757
[glass shattering]

19:53.259 --> 19:54.394
Whoa.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.732
Phakaaa! Ha ha!

20:01.668 --> 20:03.369
Phakaa!

20:05.806 --> 20:07.541
[panting]

20:16.550 --> 20:18.351
Hyah!

20:20.987 --> 20:22.556
Cousin, I think he’s finished.

20:26.927 --> 20:28.629
Good.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.496
Because I think
I broke my hand.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.934
‐Cousin, let me see.
‐Ow!

20:42.943 --> 20:45.679
Larry...take me home.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.749
What?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.288
Take me home?

20:55.321 --> 20:57.558
I‐is that what you said?
Take me home?

20:59.593 --> 21:00.761
Well, yeah.

21:04.698 --> 21:08.502
Balki, uh, did everything happen
th‐the way you said?

21:08.535 --> 21:10.604
Uh, I’m afraid so, cousin.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.706
Well, that,
that would explain this.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.710
If we have any further
questions, we’ll be in touch...

21:17.944 --> 21:19.946
...with him.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.615
Hey, look, if there’s any kind
of reward involved

21:21.648 --> 21:23.049
I could come up
with a believable story.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.851
Maybe we can work out
some kind of arrangement.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.523
I‐I could’ve sworn I was the one
who knocked out Kraus.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.792
Well, cousin, sometimes
we remember things

21:31.825 --> 21:33.794
the way we wished
they had happened.

21:34.828 --> 21:36.396
I thought I was a hero.

21:37.931 --> 21:40.601
Well, you‐you were.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.869
If you hadn’t distracted Mad Dog

21:42.903 --> 21:44.938
by letting him nearly
kill you...

21:47.774 --> 21:49.643
...then I wouldn’t
have had enough time

21:49.676 --> 21:51.344
to go get the frying pan
and...

21:52.145 --> 21:53.680
...save your life.

21:55.516 --> 21:56.817
I’m very proud of you, Larry.

21:57.951 --> 22:00.521
And I’m proud of you too, Balki.

22:00.554 --> 22:03.557
And I have all weekend
to show you how much.

22:08.762 --> 22:12.733
Well, I‐I‐I know...
one thing we could do.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.570
Bingi bingi?

22:17.971 --> 22:19.540
You said it.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.679
Shall we?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.781
♪ You put your bingi in ♪

22:27.814 --> 22:29.783
♪ You put your bingi out ♪

22:29.816 --> 22:31.785
♪ You put your bingi in ♪

22:31.818 --> 22:33.887
