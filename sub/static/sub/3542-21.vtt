00:02.160 --> 00:03.730
Previously on Vampire Diaries:

00:03.880 --> 00:06.564
Does Elena enjoy having
both of you worship at her altar?

00:06.760 --> 00:10.446
I love you. Look me in the eye and tell
me you don't feel something for him.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.570
- Aah!
- To break the sire bond...

00:13.720 --> 00:15.245
you gotta make yourself turn.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.971
I turned about 100 times
in the Appalachian mountains.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.242
I won't know if it's broken till I test it.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.564
If you are to kill all of my children,
I will need to bind your ring to the stake.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.246
Rendering the white oak indestructible.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.125
- What are you doing with him?
- I'm going to re-make him.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.965
Make him strong, fast, a true hunter.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.243
I'm not gonna complete the transition.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.483
- So we're just gonna let you die?
- I can't be a vampire.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.289
You're ditching
my clean-up committee?

01:34.440 --> 01:37.603
Klaus called. He's leaving town
and wants me to pack up his house.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.604
Well, since when does sire bond
equal mover-slave?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.690
Since he realized
you're not gonna dump me for him.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.842
Ugh, he's being petty.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.849
And he still thinks I'm sired to him.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.169
It's fine. I'll keep up the act
and it will all be over soon.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.286
- I'm late, I gotta go. I love you.
- I love you too.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.964
Hello?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.680
- Where's Matt?
- He bailed.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.322
- Got called into work at the last minute.
- Are you kidding me?

02:18.600 --> 02:21.331
- So it's just us?
- Yes, and you're late.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.522
Clean-up committee started at 8:00.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.610
- It's, like, 8:02.
- Exactly. I managed to turn up on time...

02:26.760 --> 02:30.481
and I didn't even get to attend
the dance that I organized.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.361
I'm sorry about your mom.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.320
I mean, I know you,
like, hated her and everything...

02:45.480 --> 02:47.448
but still...

02:47.680 --> 02:49.682
I'm sorry.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.647
I'm sorry about your teacher.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.325
He seemed like a nice guy.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.088
Yeah, he was.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.041
I'm gonna get started on the gym.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.171
- You're supposed to be dead.
- I am.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.527
- Going darker, huh?
- It's the only color we had.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.082
That's what happens when you decide
to paint your dead-guardian's room.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.961
I don't suppose anyone tried to talk
you guys out of doing this so soon.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.602
We have to keep moving,
otherwise we'll start thinking.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.081
- And we don't wanna think.
- You want a hand?

04:26.320 --> 04:29.642
- So are you two, like, back together?
- What? No, Jer, we're just...

04:29.800 --> 04:34.567
Uh, I was just checking up on you guys.
Seeing how you were doing after, uh...

04:34.720 --> 04:35.767
After everything.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.570
We're fine.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.044
But if you are trying to be the good guy
again, why don't you do the right thing...

04:42.200 --> 04:44.646
and give us one day
without any vampires in it.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.882
- He didn't mean that.
- Yeah. Yeah, he did.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.484
I'll get that.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.445
We have a problem.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.443
Alaric Saltzman just tried to kill me.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.602
Alaric Saltzman is supposed to be dead.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.570
He's not and he's a vampire,
thanks to Mother's spell...

05:19.720 --> 05:21.927
with a white-oak stake
that can't kill him.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.606
He's stronger, Nik, too strong.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.610
- Where is he now?
- Stuck at school without a daylight ring.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.167
But as soon as night falls,
he'll come after us.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.446
We need to leave now.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.641
Fine. I'll collect Elena
and we'll be on our way.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.770
Forget Elena, you don't need
any more stupid hybrids.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.811
What I need is protection from
Esther's continued assaults against us.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.927
We'll protect each other.
Like we always have.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.644
Always and forever, Nik.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.130
I'm not leaving without her.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.206
I'm leaving now.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.928
You either walk out that door with me
or you are on your own.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.525
Fine.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.366
Trust your hybrids over your family.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.684
Let your spite be the death of you,
see if I care.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.043
Move it, sire boy.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.848
What's her deal?

06:26.960 --> 06:29.725
What do you mean he turned?
You were standing guard.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.565
Don't blame me.
Blame Bonnie the blood bank.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.564
- She fed him.
- I had no idea what was happening.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.769
The witches led me there.
They wanted him to feed so he'd turn.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.203
- So where's the stake now?
- The one that can kill an Original...

06:42.360 --> 06:45.250
and wipe out an entire line
of vampires? We don't know.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.041
If you are so upset with me, why'd you
feed me your blood to save my life?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.851
Because I do stupid things, Bonnie.
I do things like...

06:52.000 --> 06:55.482
let my friend die with dignity
when I should've just killed him.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.809
- How do we kill him now?
- I've been trying to figure that out.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.122
A witch can't truly make
an immortal creature.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.521
There's always a way to undo a spell.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.287
So, what's the witch-y workaround?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.002
That's the problem.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.363
I don't know.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.881
Whoever this is, it's not funny.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.122
<i>Who else would it be?</i>

07:30.720 --> 07:31.767
Ric?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.729
Listen closely.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.168
I'm at the school. I have Caroline.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.041
And if you wanna keep her alive,
I need you into get in your car...

07:41.200 --> 07:42.884
and come down here right away.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.647
If you tell anyone
where you are going...

07:47.080 --> 07:49.048
I will kill her.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.569
- What the hell do you want?
- Is that any way to treat a guest?

08:03.520 --> 08:04.681
What are you doing here?

08:04.840 --> 08:08.447
For starters, young Jeremy here could
show some manners and invite me in.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.046
Why don't you go up to your room?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.482
Now.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.081
Hmm, poor lad. Loses one
questionable father figure...

08:22.240 --> 08:24.641
only to be replaced
by the two of you.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.485
Yeah, about that,
something happened.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.326
Oh, I know about my mother's invulnerable
little creation, that's why I'm here.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.688
I'm leaving town. Just need to pick up
a few road-trip necessities.

08:34.840 --> 08:39.368
Spare tire, flashlight, doppelgÃ¤nger.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.645
Can't help you there.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.888
Elena.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.525
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.887
She was just here a few minutes ago.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.409
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.927
What do you mean she's not here?
Where did she go?

09:21.280 --> 09:22.964
What's going on?

09:24.320 --> 09:27.722
Klaus wants in.
I have to keep him out.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.167
Aah, duck!

09:43.440 --> 09:45.283
Right on time.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.805
Caroline.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.247
Let her go, Alaric.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.889
Free her yourself.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.208
Hey.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.644
You said that you would let her go.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.930
How many times do I have to tell you?
Stop trusting vampires.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.729
I think you're probably
gonna want to let me in.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.925
Elena's car's gone.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.651
Why wouldn't she tell anyone
where she was going?

11:25.400 --> 11:27.801
Get down!
- Missed me.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.451
Missed me again!

11:39.960 --> 11:41.450
Alaric.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.367
Put it out.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.170
Come outside and make me.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.282
Elena's not here.
Alaric has her and Caroline.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.768
He's gonna kill them both
unless you turn yourself over to him.

12:05.080 --> 12:08.323
Now, I know you're not asking me
to walk into a certain death.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.211
I really wish we could.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.921
Unfortunately, if Alaric kills you,
there's a 1-in-4 chance we die too.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.647
- I'll take those odds.
- And a 100 percent chance Tyler dies.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.524
Could live with that too.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.605
Why don't we just figure out a way
to put Alaric down, hmm?

12:29.800 --> 12:32.167
How about Damon sneaks in
and distracts Alaric...

12:32.320 --> 12:35.005
while Stefan grabs Elena
and carries her to safety?

12:35.200 --> 12:38.283
Great idea. What's to stop me
from getting killed instantly?

12:38.480 --> 12:39.561
Nothing.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.200
Caroline's in there.
Don't you have a thing for her?

12:42.400 --> 12:44.767
Or did she just reject you
too many times?

12:44.920 --> 12:46.684
This isn't really, uh, helping too much.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.885
I might have an idea.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.602
My mom used a desiccation spell
on Mikael...

12:51.760 --> 12:53.808
that immobilized him
for over 15 years.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.082
If I can get it, I might be able to use it.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.210
"If" and "might."
Your words inspire such confidence.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.447
I'll get it.

13:00.600 --> 13:04.446
But even with the spell, we'll need a lot
of vampire muscle to take him down.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.001
Including yours.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.449
Just so we're clear,
the sun sets in about eight hours.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.248
If we don't succeed before then,
Elena will be dead, I'll be gone...

13:17.440 --> 13:20.250
and the rest of you will be left
to fend for yourselves.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.082
No. I don't want to. Please no more.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.123
- Alaric, stop...
- Sit down.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.489
This keeps the vervain in her system.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.564
It's like inhaling razor blades
with every breath.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.765
Why are you doing this?

13:45.920 --> 13:48.969
To make it easier on you
when you put her out of her misery.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.251
What? No.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.970
Isn't this what you wanted?

13:54.120 --> 13:56.122
For me to teach you
how to kill a vampire?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.448
Well, here's a vampire, Elena.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.846
Kill her.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.321
- This isn't what I want.
- Of course it is.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.203
All those hours you spent training,
getting stronger.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.169
You could be a hunter, Elena.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.083
But you've never actually staked
a vampire through the heart.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.609
Well, this is promising.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.571
Relax, Abby will be here.

14:31.760 --> 14:36.209
I'm sorry. I forgot about her stellar track
record in the dependability department.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.808
Jamie said she was coming, okay?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.480
Just give her time.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.401
Don't get your hopes up,
might be a Girl Scout.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.566
Hello, Bonnie.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.210
Thanks for coming.

14:55.960 --> 15:00.045
Jamie's worried about you,
he said it was urgent.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.771
I just didn't think
you'd ever wanna see me again.

15:05.720 --> 15:09.850
Like Jamie said, it's urgent.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.011
- Abby just showed up.
- Good.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.846
Perhaps this plan won't be
an epic failure after all.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.808
If this does go off and we
drop the history teacher in the Atlantic...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.207
I'm still leaving with Elena.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.726
I'll go with you.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.126
Really?

15:41.040 --> 15:44.123
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.369
I'd turn my back on everything here
to make sure Elena's safe.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.205
And that is what makes you
her better option.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.008
It's a shame it's not easier
for Elena to see that.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.288
Personally, I think she's
wasting her time with Damon.

15:59.880 --> 16:04.249
All this energy you've spent trying to get
me and my brother to hate each other...

16:04.440 --> 16:07.046
- ...it's actually had the opposite effect.
- Heh, heh.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.206
Has it? Has it really?

16:09.400 --> 16:13.610
Then perhaps I should let Elena decide
which Salvatore joins us?

16:13.760 --> 16:16.161
Being as you and Damon are so close.

16:16.880 --> 16:21.647
Ah, go for it. Damon and I have been
through a hell of a lot worse than you.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.564
- Why didn't I have to be invited in?
- Only vampires live here.

16:28.720 --> 16:34.523
We'd signed over the deed to Elena,
but she died and the seal broke.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.803
It's a very long story. Blood?

16:40.080 --> 16:43.004
Oh, come on.
Think of it as a peace offering.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.011
Fine. More for me.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.606
We called you here
because I need help with a spell.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.328
Esther created a vampire
that can't be killed.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.767
I wanna desiccate him
like you did to Mikael.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.648
Bonnie, it's too dangerous.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.970
Your magic comes from the earth.
It's pure.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.363
This spell asks you
to tap into dark places.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.002
Places of temptation,
places you can't handle.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.964
You turned your back on me
for 16 years.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.049
You have no idea what I can handle.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.201
Gotta say I'm Team Bonnie on this one.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.401
How hard can it be to parch a vampire?

17:31.560 --> 17:35.121
The spell allows you
to stop a vampire's heart.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.684
The blood will stop flowing
and his body will desiccate.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.162
- That's exactly what we wanna do.
- To stop a vampire's heart...

17:42.320 --> 17:45.244
you need to find a balance
among the living.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.165
Can you handle that?

17:51.280 --> 17:55.001
What? What does that mean?
Bonnie, I don't speak witch.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.291
I have to stop a human heart.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.764
We just got this. It connects me to
Caroline and Elena through our phones.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.604
They're in Alaric's classroom.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.127
- We should go in from the south entrance.
- Hmm.

18:17.320 --> 18:20.483
Digital locator spell.
Why the hell do we need you then?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.971
- Hand it over.
- Not giving you my ring. Let me do this.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.761
By my math, you've already bit it once,
possibly twice, wearing that thing.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.248
If for some reason Bonnie can't restart
your heart and you do die...

18:31.400 --> 18:32.925
then before you know it...

18:33.080 --> 18:35.651
we have another
psycho alter-ego case on our hands.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.561
- Which is bad. So give me the ring.
- This is my ring, Elena's my sister.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.922
No one's gonna fight harder
for her than me.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.841
Fine, be stubborn.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.561
Try not to kill him, will you?

18:49.080 --> 18:52.209
Look at this, one big happy family.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.409
Drink this, it's my blood.
It bridges us all together...

18:56.560 --> 19:00.087
so when I stop Jeremy's heart,
you'll have the power to stop Alaric's.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.363
You'll have to make a physical
connection to his bloodstream.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.649
A vein, artery,
something connected to his heart.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.646
If one of gets a clean shot, take it.
The other two hold him down.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.050
Before we all walk through these doors,
let's get on the same page, shall we?

19:16.240 --> 19:19.210
I was the one who created
your vampire bloodline, therefore...

19:19.360 --> 19:23.922
I am responsible for your lives,
and Tyler's life, Caroline's life...

19:24.080 --> 19:27.641
and, of course, Abby's life,
should anything go wrong.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.201
- Or you're lying to save your ass.
- I'm not lying.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.566
Go ahead, call my bluff.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.889
Let the teacher kill me,
you'll all be dead soon thereafter.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.611
Let's just get this over with. Shall we?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.369
Why are you doing this?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.409
Because you need me.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.291
You're an 18-year-old girl
without parents or guidance...

19:51.440 --> 19:53.488
or any sense of right
and wrong anymore.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.007
Look at you. How is this right?

19:56.480 --> 19:57.845
She's a murderer.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.526
She told me she killed someone
and liked it.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.327
Now, how is that right?

20:03.520 --> 20:08.686
Listen, Elena,
your parents led the Council.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.811
It was their life's mission
to keep this town safe.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.651
They weren't dead six months
before you undid it all.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.610
- You don't know anything about them.
- Why, am I wrong?

20:18.800 --> 20:22.122
Do you actually think
that they'd be proud of you?

20:26.680 --> 20:29.809
If you don't side with the humans...

20:32.400 --> 20:34.129
you're just as bad as them.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.329
Now kill her.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.044
Or I'll do it for you,
and I'll make it hurt.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.251
- Thought I taught you better than that.
- You did.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.442
Get help.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.043
Not so fast.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.204
Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's me.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.567
It's okay. You're safe.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.645
We'll save Elena.
You go straight home.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.770
You stay inside, do you understand?

21:29.120 --> 21:30.531
Do you understand me?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.882
Thank you.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.166
I should kill you. I should gut you
like Brian Walters, Bill Forbes...

21:49.320 --> 21:51.846
and all the cowards
I plan on ripping apart.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.721
You're the worst offender of them all,
Elena. You don't deserve to live.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.008
So then why am I still alive?

21:58.160 --> 22:00.162
There's obviously
no humanity left in you.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.728
So, what's stopping you, Alaric?

22:02.920 --> 22:05.491
Unh, if you want me dead, then kill me.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.451
Do it. Kill me!

22:20.520 --> 22:21.760
Do it, now.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.602
They made contact.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.526
It's happening...

22:56.000 --> 22:57.047
What's wrong?

22:57.200 --> 23:00.090
Something happened.
The connection broke.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.121
Stop!

23:11.360 --> 23:13.647
Let him go, or I'll kill myself.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.290
Put it down, Elena.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.051
Why?
Because you still need me alive?

23:19.200 --> 23:22.647
There's a reason why Esther
used me to make you, isn't there?

23:22.800 --> 23:27.328
She didn't want you to be immortal,
so she tied your life to a human one.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.529
Mine.
That way you have only one lifespan...

23:30.720 --> 23:34.008
to kill all vampires
and then you'll be gone.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.925
So when I die, you die too.
That's it. It has to be.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.526
You're wrong.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.681
Am I?

23:48.080 --> 23:50.321
Stop! Stop! Stop!

24:11.200 --> 24:12.645
Oh, be careful.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.081
Moving only makes it hurt more.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.690
What are you doing?

24:18.840 --> 24:20.569
Draining you of all your blood.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.925
- Elena?
- Tyler.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.286
Help me.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.722
He can't.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.281
He needs to go fetch me
more empty blood bags.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.484
- About three liters' worth, please, Tyler.
- Tyler, please.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.727
Get Stefan. Please.

24:44.920 --> 24:48.606
No, Tyler, get the bags.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.364
Forget the girl and get the bags.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.891
Now.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.766
So that's it?
You're just gonna bleed me dry?

25:22.080 --> 25:25.050
Yes, but don't worry...

25:25.320 --> 25:27.322
it'll be completely painless.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.969
As the last drop is drawn...

25:31.120 --> 25:32.963
you'll simply fall asleep.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.090
Why am I still alive?

25:50.680 --> 25:52.648
Get up.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.124
I said get up.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.564
- Klaus is gonna kill Elena.
- What?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.287
What are you talking about?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.046
Klaus needs Elena's blood
to make hybrids.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.804
She's the last person he'd kill.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.531
The witch bound my life to Elena's.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.690
If she dies, I die.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.962
Klaus figured that out
and now he's taken her.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.001
Now, I'm trapped here
until the sun goes down.

26:27.200 --> 26:31.842
So you two better get doing
what you do best, saving Elena's life.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.201
What about your hybrids?

26:42.360 --> 26:45.682
You'll need more than this
to create your army.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.890
These last few liters
will have to suffice.

26:55.320 --> 26:58.244
<i>You see, by attempting to kill us...</i>

26:58.400 --> 27:01.688
my mother strengthened the bond
between my siblings and I.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.120
I don't need hybrids.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.731
I have my family.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.851
If you believe that,
then why take my blood at all?

27:12.440 --> 27:14.727
You want a backup family.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.362
You know that your siblings
will never trust you again.

27:19.640 --> 27:24.407
You know, Stefan blames me
for trying to tear him from his brother.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.450
But I think we both know
who really came between them.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.526
You.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.525
That's why you won't choose.

27:32.720 --> 27:37.567
You know once you pick a Salvatore,
you'll destroy their bond.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.927
Mm. Consider this me doing you a favor.

27:43.080 --> 27:46.243
Once you're dead,
you won't have to choose.

27:46.800 --> 27:51.089
No broken hearts,
their family stays intact.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.241
But just between us girls...

27:55.920 --> 27:58.400
who would you have picked?

28:01.760 --> 28:03.091
Rot in hell.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.884
Hmm.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.281
You're welcome.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.488
Sweet dreams, Elena.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.681
It's been fun.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.808
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.286
Tyler.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.006
So much for that sire bond.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.964
I'm not your little bitch anymore.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.842
How did you break the sire bond?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.641
By breaking every bone in my body
100 times for the girl I love.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.528
- That's impossible.
- Is it?

29:20.760 --> 29:24.731
Or maybe real love
is stronger than fake loyalty.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.845
- But what would you know about that?
- You know, you should be thanking me.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.685
I gave you a gift,
I took away your misery.

29:31.840 --> 29:36.243
You didn't give a crap about me.
You just didn't wanna be alone.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.891
Come on.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.964
Goodbye, Tyler.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.282
Hey. You okay?

30:46.080 --> 30:47.525
Come on.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.365
Oh, my God. Jeremy?

31:46.640 --> 31:50.167
Jeremy!

32:16.920 --> 32:19.207
We should get her home
before the sun sets.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.925
You two are really gonna walk me
all the way to the door, aren't you?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.366
Lost a lot of blood today.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.967
Yeah, I know, but I told you I'm fine.
I just have a little headache.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.602
Sun's about to go down and Ric's
gonna be able to terrorize the streets.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.285
Yeah, but he can't hurt me.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.568
It's you two that
we should be worrying about.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.564
Ah, he won't be able to find us.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.570
I'll, uh... I'll call you when we get back.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.411
I know it's selfish.

33:22.240 --> 33:27.201
I know that it seems like
I'm stringing you both along, but I...

33:27.640 --> 33:29.881
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.569
I mean...

33:33.760 --> 33:36.525
if I choose one of you,
then I lose the other.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.970
And I've lost so many people, I just...

33:43.160 --> 33:45.731
I can't bear the thought
of losing one of you.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.286
Uh, it's, uh...

33:59.640 --> 34:02.211
It's been a long day.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.361
Yeah, we'll call you from the road.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.324
After we dump Klaus' body
in the Atlantic.

34:10.520 --> 34:13.922
Just be careful.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.723
Both of you.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.969
What are you guys doing here?

34:46.120 --> 34:48.043
Welcome to our victory party.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.726
What victory?

34:50.040 --> 34:51.929
We failed, Alaric's still out there.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.004
We know. But we've been trying
to get rid of Klaus forever.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.640
And Caroline convinced us to enjoy it,
for a night.

34:57.800 --> 34:58.961
Gonna be honest.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.567
I'm pissed none of you let me help
take down Original Brother Number 2.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.768
He would've taken you
down to the hospital.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.127
I'm more stealth than that.
I'm like a ninja.

35:07.320 --> 35:10.324
- You wish.
- Here. You need this.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.246
I heard.

35:13.400 --> 35:18.930
And you know that sooner or later
you're gonna have to choose, right'?

35:19.320 --> 35:21.322
I know.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.684
Hey. Give me your hand.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.330
Thank you for standing up
to Klaus like that.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.000
Let's just say
it's been a long time coming.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.650
Way too long.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.441
- All right, let's drink.
- I do not condone this, by the way.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.206
You survived Klaus.
Make an exception.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.840
You can go back to being
responsible tomorrow.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.571
- Okay. Heh.
- Hang on.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.767
Do you guys hear that?

35:53.120 --> 35:55.248
That is the sound of a Klaus-free life.

35:58.360 --> 36:01.011
To a Klaus-free life.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.844
And to all of you.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.684
- My family.
- Cheers.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.047
Cheers. Yes.

36:14.280 --> 36:18.046
Carol, what's so urgent you called an
emergency Council meeting at this hour?

36:18.200 --> 36:21.010
I didn't call the meeting, Liz.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.049
He did.

36:24.400 --> 36:28.291
Join us, sheriff. I was just telling
the Council about our vampire problem.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.924
- Or should I say your problem?
- What do you think you're doing?

36:32.120 --> 36:34.600
Perhaps you and the mayor
can enlighten the group...

36:34.760 --> 36:37.604
on the strides you've taken
to eliminate the issue.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.161
Oh, that's right. You haven't.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.881
You see, the sheriff,
a woman we elected...

36:43.040 --> 36:46.123
to keep our families safe
and town secure...

36:46.520 --> 36:48.807
has a vampire for a daughter.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.043
And our lovely mayor, a son...

36:55.200 --> 36:58.363
who is half-vampire, half-werewolf.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.171
- Why are you doing this?
- These women are hypocrites.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.489
They claim to head our defense
against a supernatural presence...

37:05.640 --> 37:08.325
then cover up attacks
committed by their children.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.962
That's enough. We're done here.
It's time to go.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.288
Sit down, Liz.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.611
We're just getting started.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.365
Yeah.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.361
What?

37:28.120 --> 37:31.920
How many desiccated hybrids
does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

37:33.440 --> 37:36.171
- You're in a good mood.
- Yeah, I'm in a good mood.

37:36.640 --> 37:41.202
Klaus is dead,
my brother's halfway sane again.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.722
Give or take an immortal hunter
that wants to kill us...

37:45.160 --> 37:47.128
we won, Stefan.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.369
- Come on, say it. Say it.
- We won.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.491
Once more, with feeling.

37:54.040 --> 37:57.283
- We won.
- Thank you.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.282
No, you know what? Thank you.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.765
Turns out we make
a pretty good team, huh?

38:05.360 --> 38:09.285
- It only took a century and a half.
- Hmm.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.281
<i>What happens when, uh...</i>

38:14.800 --> 38:17.451
Elena makes her decision?

38:19.560 --> 38:24.202
You know how these things pan out.
She'll make a list of pros and cons...

38:24.400 --> 38:27.324
and at the end of the day,
dump both of our asses.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.366
What if she doesn't?

38:34.800 --> 38:37.531
Then she'll pick one of us.

38:40.520 --> 38:43.046
Well, if she chooses you...

38:43.720 --> 38:47.884
I'll leave town and let you two
be happy and not be bothered by me.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.448
And in 60 years...

38:53.640 --> 38:57.884
we'll go back to being brothers and
none of this will have mattered. Right?

38:58.080 --> 38:59.650
Heh. Yeah.

39:02.720 --> 39:06.088
Fine. If she chooses you, I'll...

39:06.280 --> 39:08.567
leave town too.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.844
All this over one girl.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.164
She's a pretty special girl.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.047
Yes, she is.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.729
Hey. Everyone gone?

39:40.880 --> 39:42.325
It's just us.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.608
I hate this room.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.162
Me too. Heh.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.200
Mom and Dad were right.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.483
Alaric should just kill all the vampires
and put an end to all of this.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.604
But then that means
that Caroline dies.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.528
And Bonnie loses her mom.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.051
The mayor loses her son.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.324
And I lose Stefan and Damon.

40:15.480 --> 40:20.088
So if it makes me the bad guy
for wanting to keep those people alive...

40:20.280 --> 40:23.602
then fine, I'll be the bad guy.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.962
You forget Alaric
never wanted any of this.

40:26.120 --> 40:30.364
Once he carries out his plans, what if he
decides he doesn't wanna live anymore'?

40:30.520 --> 40:34.730
And he kills his human connection
to end his life.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.486
That would mean I would lose you.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.690
I'm not gonna let that happen.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.728
I'm gonna shower and get some sleep.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.288
Good night, Elena.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.169
Good night.
