WEBVTT

01:10.471 --> 01:11.339
- Excited.
- Oh, I can start

01:11.339 --> 01:12.573
watching cartoons again.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.841
- Oh, my God.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.176
Happy Thanksgiving, people.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.478
Eat.
- Where's the turkey?

01:17.478 --> 01:18.746
- I told you my
parents are vegan.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.381
- Oh, yeah, you're
gonna love it.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.383
- Look, it looks great, thanks.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.017
- Oh, it is.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.353
Don't ask, honey, just eat.

01:28.756 --> 01:29.923
- All right.
- Good.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.692
- Here we go again,
Thanksgiving.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.327
- Oh, I am just stuffed.
- It was great.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.295
- I know, this was just so good.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.229
I don't think I can eat any--

01:35.229 --> 01:36.730
- I think I need a nap.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.665
- I know.

01:37.665 --> 01:38.999
Thank you so much for hosting.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.168
- So, I uh,

01:41.369 --> 01:44.638
I have really great news.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.439
- What?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.209
- I finally got published.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.444
- Oh, why, Holly, we are

01:50.444 --> 01:51.779
so proud of you.
- That's right.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.381
- I know how hard you've worked.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.048
- I know.
- Oh.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.185
Excellent, Holly,
it's wonderful.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.319
I'm so glad.
- Thank you, Daddy.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.787
- Where can I read it?

02:00.988 --> 02:02.790
- "The Black Hills
Literary Journal,"

02:02.790 --> 02:04.057
it's an academic paper.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.194
- "Black Hills," that
is very prestigious.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.828
It's pure Ivy League.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.396
It's a major
accomplishment, baby.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.964
- Thank you.
- Which article?

02:12.065 --> 02:15.169
- Oh, "Art of Deception:
The False Narrator

02:15.169 --> 02:16.970
"in Mid-20th Century Novels."

02:16.970 --> 02:18.239
- I remember it, yeah.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.940
- Well, you must have
made good money on it.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.544
- Um, just a couple,
couple hundred bucks,

02:23.544 --> 02:24.612
but that's not really
what it's about--

02:24.612 --> 02:25.979
- A couple hundred?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.415
- I told you, honey,

02:27.415 --> 02:29.883
my sis is an English
professor, Dr. Willinger.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.285
Remember?
- Of course.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.454
- It really is good
for my career, because

02:33.454 --> 02:35.856
once you're published--
- We're pregnant.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.558
- Oh my God.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.659
Oh my God.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.060
- Wait, what?

02:40.060 --> 02:41.695
Oh God, thank you.
- I'm gonna be a grandma?

02:41.695 --> 02:42.596
- Yeah.
- Finally?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.365
I'm thrilled.
- Right.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.669
- Baby sis, I am
so happy for you.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.770
How far along?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.004
I just--
- Seven weeks.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.473
I mean, I literally
just found out--

02:52.473 --> 02:53.874
- Your mother threw
up every minute

02:53.874 --> 02:55.042
of every day.
- I did.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.844
I was horribly sick.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.312
Wasn't I, sweetheart?
- First couple of months.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.247
- Things to look forward to.
- But that's not gonna

02:59.247 --> 03:00.748
happen to you.
- Yeah.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.384
- You're gonna be so, oh,
you're already glowing.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.728
- Gosh, Auntie Holly.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.197
You're gonna
have to get used to that.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.666
- Guess I should get her a gift.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.368
- Maybe a card.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.070
Dear Carol, you've one-upped
me for the last time.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.538
Love and daggers, Holly.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.006
- Stop.

03:26.006 --> 03:26.840
- It's true, though.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.675
What more could she do?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.543
- You know, it's weird.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.514
While everybody was
hugging and celebrating,

03:34.948 --> 03:36.116
all I could think was,

03:37.585 --> 03:39.853
what have I done in
the last five years?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.858
I spent all of my 20s
obsessing over dead authors,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.060
while everybody around
me was having babies

03:47.060 --> 03:48.696
and giving life, real life.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.563
- Uh, hi.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.098
Not everybody has kids.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.132
I don't have kids.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.001
- Yeah, but you're married.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.102
- Yeah, there's that.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.938
- I don't even have a--
- Boyfriend?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.807
Yeah, that's not
exactly a secret.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.874
Believe me.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.075
- All just friends.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.011
- Well, we're gonna
fix it, come on.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.513
- So how
did you meet Sean?

04:05.513 --> 04:08.782
- It was that dating app,
you know, Cupid's Arrow.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.784
Oh come on, it's how
people meet these days.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.219
It's actually scary accurate.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.954
It's by one of the Facebook
engineer, that did it.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.155
- Ah.
- Oh look at you.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.290
You don't believe me?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.625
All right.
- Hey!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.192
- What, you don't trust me?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.594
I even know your
pin code, come on.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.367
Cupid's Arrow is on your phone.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.768
- Oh.
- Use it.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.036
Please use it.

04:30.971 --> 04:31.905
- I'm not going to use it.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.706
- You're gonna use it.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.442
I command you to use it.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.329
- Woo!
- Oh, hello.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.063
- What are you doing, Holly?

04:56.063 --> 04:56.897
Ooh.
- No!

04:58.332 --> 05:00.434
- Holly, what are you even
trying to say with this?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.535
- Oh come on, don't be mean.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.070
- This is absurd.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.004
Really?

05:04.004 --> 05:05.573
- Don't lie, be truthful.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.407
- It's you.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.274
I don't need to lie.

05:08.141 --> 05:08.976
Okay.

05:10.143 --> 05:10.978
Smile.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.812
- No.

05:13.881 --> 05:14.948
- I took like five.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.784
- Okay.
- Is that one good?

05:16.784 --> 05:17.918
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

05:17.918 --> 05:19.587
- Okay?
- It's kinda good.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.988
- Okay, trust me.
- Okay.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.356
- Now all we have to do is wait.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.831
- Do you mind if I
order the Steak Vesuvio?

05:31.799 --> 05:34.001
- No, why would I mind?

05:34.001 --> 05:34.935
- It's $27.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.739
- Okay.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.408
- Well, you're a
college professor.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.776
I just wanted to make
sure you could afford it.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.380
- Mm, mm.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.082
What do you get when
you cross the engine

05:49.082 --> 05:52.553
from a '67 Harley, Ducati
forks, and carbon fiber?

05:52.553 --> 05:53.521
- I don't know.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.656
Perfection!

05:55.656 --> 05:58.225
Perfection in motorcycle form.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.094
I'll show you later.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.068
- And that's why I think
Charles Dickens created one

06:08.068 --> 06:11.605
of the greatest Christmas
literature pieces ever.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.842
I mean, Scrooge's story
alone, it gives hope.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.043
It gives possibility

06:16.043 --> 06:17.645
that somebody can turn
their lives around

06:17.645 --> 06:20.047
and be kind again and
open up their heart,

06:20.047 --> 06:21.148
become a better person.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.282
- Yeah.

06:27.988 --> 06:28.822
- Hey, honey.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.226
Yeah.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.395
- Well, I work
mostly out of my van.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.964
Actually outside.
- Is it?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.866
- Would you like to see it?

06:38.866 --> 06:40.333
- Uh, no, not yet.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.270
- You know, you haven't
touched your muffin.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.705
- I'm not hungry.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.910
- Can I have it?

06:49.910 --> 06:50.844
- Well, I'll meet y'all there.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.480
Is Pastor Phil gonna be there?

06:54.381 --> 06:55.415
His wife too?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.650
Okay, okay.

06:56.650 --> 07:00.120
- "From Dusk till Dawn,"
Clooney, in that film,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.722
oh my God, he's amazing.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.724
That's exactly what
I wanna be like.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.925
- They're behind the dryer,

07:04.925 --> 07:08.328
and I put Jimmy's
socks on the ottoman.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.798
- I've dated a lot of
Asian girls in the past.

07:11.965 --> 07:12.800
Thank you.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.336
- Can I have the check, please?

07:52.405 --> 07:53.807
I'm oh for three.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.042
I'm out.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.309
- You can't be out.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.477
You've hardly given
it any time at all.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.979
It's a very good app.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.748
It had very good reviews,
and it uses algorithms.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.782
- Do you even know
what that means?

08:01.782 --> 08:03.016
- Yes, I'm a maths teacher.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.352
I'm not a great
one, but I am one.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.355
Okay, so hopefully, this
place has some, right,

08:08.355 --> 08:10.323
because he mentioned that
he used to play the violin,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.025
and that is before I knew him.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.162
- Okay, why don't you just get
him something he can't buy?

08:15.162 --> 08:18.298
- Because I suggested
dancing, and he said no.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.499
- Sean's a great guy.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.869
You're lucky.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.803
We'll figure it out,
let's go inside.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.104
- Oh yeah, it's really cold.

08:31.044 --> 08:31.879
There.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.748
Okay, what are we thinking?

08:34.748 --> 08:35.582
I like this one.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.616
Do you like this one?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.620
Holly, what are you doing?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.888
- I'm deleting my profile.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.222
- No, you're not.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.424
Okay.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.727
How difficult can it be
to find an attractive,

08:46.727 --> 08:50.230
30-something man, no kids,
single, over six feet tall?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.999
- Look, I would
settle for breathing,

08:51.999 --> 08:53.233
unmarried, with a
brain and a heart.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.202
- Is it
really that bad?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.004
- Yeah, you didn't
see those guys.

08:57.004 --> 08:57.805
- Good grief.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.707
Okay.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.277
Okay, hello, here is one.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.681
And, uh, his name is
literally Mr. Wright.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.184
- Hm.

09:11.184 --> 09:15.989
Well, I mean, he
might be too pretty.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.592
- Who says something like that?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.393
Nobody is too pretty.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.561
Okay.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.263
Now he knows you're interested.

09:28.001 --> 09:28.836
It'll do.

09:28.836 --> 09:29.670
We're good.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.151
- Whoa, let me
help you out there.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.894
Could you tell me where
the admin office is?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.129
- Yeah, just gimme a second.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.264
- Oh.
- A bit of a mess here.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.932
- Here, let me help.

09:59.933 --> 10:00.934
- Thank you.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.705
You're a professor.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.706
- Oh, it shows, huh?

10:06.573 --> 10:08.676
I'm an attorney, a litigator.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.944
- Oh, so you sue people.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.346
- I get people
what they deserve.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.948
But, don't worry, I'm
one of the good ones.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.118
- Follow me.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.620
- So, what do you teach here?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.522
- Well, how do you
know I'm a professor?

10:22.522 --> 10:23.356
- Lucky guess.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.993
- Okay, guess which department.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.662
- Not math.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.964
You're far too attractive
to be a math teacher.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.700
- You should see
our math department.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.535
- And with coffee and donuts,

10:35.535 --> 10:36.870
too kind for chemistry.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.808
Have you ever met a chemistry
teacher who wasn't angry?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.410
- I'm sure I have.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.580
- I'm gonna go with psychology.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.849
- How did you know that?

10:48.849 --> 10:51.451
- I'm a really good litigator.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.154
And I may have peeked
inside your bag.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.290
- Cheater.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.027
Well, this is you.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.895
Beware, Mrs. Gunderman,
you have to get past her,

11:01.895 --> 11:03.964
and she eats litigators
for breakfast.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.968
- Ah, well, thanks for
the help and the tip.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.739
- I'm Erin Rafferty.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.374
- Wright, Josh Wright.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.877
- Okay.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.713
- Oh, don't forget these.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.614
Otherwise, your students
will all transfer

11:21.614 --> 11:23.583
to your rival, Southern Edge.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.617
- We can't have that.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.562
- Excuse me, could you tell me

11:35.562 --> 11:37.798
where I could find
a David Martin?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.233
- He's in class for
the next 10 minutes.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.501
You can wait for
him in his office,

11:41.501 --> 11:43.336
but I need to see
your student ID.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.072
- Oh, uh, it's been a while

11:45.072 --> 11:46.740
since I've had a student ID,

11:46.740 --> 11:48.041
uh, Mrs. Gunderman, is it?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.279
I'm an old friend.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.381
I'm trying to surprise him.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.182
What do you say?

11:56.616 --> 11:59.219
- Room 208, and
you didn't talk to me.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.122
Now go before I change my mind.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.463
- Hi, Molls.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.400
Yes, honey, I'm sure
Santa's gonna find

12:13.400 --> 12:14.401
our house this year.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.437
Honey, I know the delivery guy

12:17.437 --> 12:18.839
sometimes has a hard
time finding our house,

12:18.839 --> 12:20.707
but Santa will, I promise.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.577
Sweetheart, I told you
already, it doesn't matter

12:24.577 --> 12:26.613
that we don't have a
chimney on our roof anymore.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.550
All right, I love you, too.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.384
Bye.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.258
Oh, come on, are you serious?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.092
- Shh.
- Sorry.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.861
Sorry, guys, sorry.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.739
- David.
- Josh.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.443
How long has it been, man?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.677
- Ah, it's great to see you.
- Shh.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.346
- Sorry, sorry,
guys, sorry, sorry.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.180
The walls are very thin here.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.414
It's great to see you.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.149
What are you, what
are you doing here?

13:02.149 --> 13:02.983
Sit down.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.455
- I'm here to crush Kappa Rho.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.658
- The fraternity, I thought
they already got suspended.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.793
- They did, and now
they're suing the school

13:13.793 --> 13:15.128
for suspending them.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.629
I represent the school.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.365
I just closed a
case like this over

13:18.365 --> 13:19.799
at Southern Edge University,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.602
had a big win, boom, killed it.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.972
- Wow, that's great, I think.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.007
- And now I'm here, same thing.

13:27.975 --> 13:28.909
- And you're still at--

13:28.909 --> 13:31.311
- Cole, Cusper, and Wright.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.245
- And Wright?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.246
Oh, you're a partner now?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.348
- Yeah , yeah.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.484
So, I'll buy you dinner.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.485
You choose the restaurant.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.686
Let's go.
- I can't.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.121
I actually need notice
for a babysitter,

13:41.121 --> 13:42.122
'cause I got Molly.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.924
But how long you here for?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.058
- Hmm, Christmas,

13:45.058 --> 13:47.660
give or take.
- Okay.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.597
- Wow, you are a
real rock star, huh?

13:53.100 --> 13:55.302
- I think the tenure
committee would disagree.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.071
- How old is Molly now?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.206
- She's six.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.677
- And how is the novel?

14:04.677 --> 14:05.946
- It's on hold.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.215
You know, since
Nancy passed away,

14:08.215 --> 14:10.918
I've just been either busy
with Molly or teaching

14:10.918 --> 14:12.785
or publishing an article.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.088
So it's been hard to
get something started.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.790
- Publish or perish, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.026
- Is that for real

14:19.026 --> 14:21.328
or just something people
say about professors?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.530
- No, that's a real thing,
but I really don't mind,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.598
because any writing is
better than no writing.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.601
- Hey, I'm really sorry for
missing Nancy's service.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.803
I was out of the country.

14:30.803 --> 14:31.738
- It's all right.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.240
You shouldn't worry about it.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.807
Um, I gotta go.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.209
Will you walk me to the car?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.712
Are you still single?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.081
- Yup.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.815
- Do you like being single?

14:42.815 --> 14:46.419
- My New Year' resolution is
to settle down, next year.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.188
- That sounds about right.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.423
- Well, it isn't all bad.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.662
- Let me just clear
off a space real quick.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.364
- No worries, I'm
right over here.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.702
- Nice.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.404
- Hey, remember that case I
was just talking to you about?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.705
- Uh, boom, you killed it?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.540
- Yeah,
yeah, that one.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.077
I got some real juice
over at Southern Edge.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.312
They love me, and they're
looking for someone

15:12.312 --> 15:14.614
who can edit and contribute
to their journals.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.984
They're big-time, right?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.485
- Yes.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.987
- Throw your hat in the ring.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.588
Let me work my magic.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.855
You are perfect for them,

15:22.855 --> 15:25.092
and it's gotta be
better than this.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.194
Focus on what you love
doing, the writing,

15:28.561 --> 15:30.830
get a better school for
Molly, make some actual money.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.099
- I don't know.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.934
- Think about it.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
Anyway, let's catch up.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
You choose that restaurant.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.706
I'm buying.
- Let's do it.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.341
It's good to see you.
- You too.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.201
- Oh, honey, no, I can't.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.504
I can't do this
right now, honey.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.805
I got too much work to do.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.243
- What's a date?

16:16.243 --> 16:17.077
- A what?

16:17.077 --> 16:17.910
- A date.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.280
- Where did you hear that from?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.914
- Grandma.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.150
- Oh.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.218
Molly, come out here,
I wanna talk to you.

16:32.725 --> 16:37.264
Okay, um, a date is when
two grown-ups go out

16:37.264 --> 16:39.132
and they have fun together.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.167
- Like the zoo?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.000
- Yes.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.302
- Or the movies?

16:42.302 --> 16:45.438
- Yeah, or they go
to a restaurant.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.175
- Do you go on dates?

16:48.175 --> 16:52.179
- Uh, no, I don't go
on dates right now.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.680
- Why not?

16:53.680 --> 16:58.151
- Because I already have
a pretty lady in my life.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.020
That's right, it's you.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.656
Come here.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.523
- I love you, Daddy.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.724
- Oh, I love you, honey.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.132
- Just us?
- Oh, jeez!

17:45.132 --> 17:47.200
- I wasn't, I, I, um--

17:47.200 --> 17:48.435
- I, I know.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.902
I just didn't see you.
- Sorry about that.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.371
- I'm Holly Willinger.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.639
- David Martin.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.840
- Nice to meet you.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.342
- Oh, we're actually
in the same department,

17:55.342 --> 17:57.510
'cause, like, my office
is by the library.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.547
They got me kinda exiled
to Siberia over there.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.584
Looks like we're it, huh?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.119
- Yeah.
- Here.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.420
- Do you have any idea what
we're supposed to be doing?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.356
- I have a list.
- Great.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.692
- It's in here, yup.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.560
- You wanna sit?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.394
Lovely.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.133
Do you want to pull up a chair?

18:20.133 --> 18:21.734
- Yeah, yeah, I should probably.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.204
I gotta put my bag
somewhere, though, right?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.738
Not in the--
- Thank you.

18:25.738 --> 18:26.739
- Oh, sorry.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.875
I'll put--
- Yeah.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.776
- You know, I'm just
gonna put it back,

18:29.776 --> 18:31.311
the other way.
- Okay.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.546
- So, my vote is to have it
be formal but not black tie,

18:33.546 --> 18:35.148
'cause that way women
don't feel forced

18:35.148 --> 18:37.083
into wearing long gowns.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.751
It's kind of fun to
wear something short.

18:38.751 --> 18:42.189
- Yeah, I, I, I would
always err on the side

18:42.189 --> 18:44.257
of wearing something shorter
as opposed to longer.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.925
- Yeah.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.195
Well, I guess, though, it
matters most where we have it,

18:48.195 --> 18:51.898
because if it's more
casual of a venue,

18:51.898 --> 18:54.033
doesn't it always
happen at the Mulberry?

18:54.033 --> 18:55.034
- It does, but I thought
we could change it up

18:55.034 --> 18:56.869
and just do something new.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.906
There's, uh, this Italian
restaurant that's new.

18:59.906 --> 19:00.740
And I heard it's really great.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.608
It's called Ivo's.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.542
Have you heard of that?

19:02.542 --> 19:03.476
- I have.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.611
It sounds pricey, though.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.812
- Oh.
- I don't know

19:05.812 --> 19:07.079
if we have it in our budget.
- Okay.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.216
Um, I could go get
a price from them.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.617
It wouldn't be hard,
and then let you know.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.884
- I'm just curious.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.653
Why not just stick
with Mulberry's?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.756
- Same old, same
old kind of thing,

19:16.756 --> 19:18.425
wanted to do something new,

19:19.592 --> 19:21.093
but I will, I'll get
in contact with them.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.095
- Okay.
- I'll send that.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.998
- Music, my favorite.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.235
- Oh, uh, my cousin
Nichole is a deejay.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.203
- That's cool.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.471
- Yeah.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.573
Anyways, I thought
she could do it.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.475
- Yeah, or we could
just get an iPod

19:35.475 --> 19:37.143
and put Christmas
music on shuffle.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.378
- Yeah, I thought of that,

19:38.378 --> 19:40.813
but my worry is that
like a bad stretch

19:40.813 --> 19:42.749
of Christmas music starts,
and then we don't know

19:42.749 --> 19:44.551
when it ends, if
you have an iPod.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.621
- Tell me one bad
Christmas song.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.089
- "Simply Having a
Wonderful Christmas"

19:50.089 --> 19:52.692
by Paul McCartney is
the worst song ever.

19:52.692 --> 19:56.028
- Oh, okay, first of
all, Sir Paul McCartney.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.063
- Oh, well, that's, you know--

19:57.063 --> 19:58.531
- And he gets a pass.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.899
He wrote "Yesterday".

19:59.899 --> 20:01.534
All sins are forgiven.
- No, he didn't.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.369
John wrote "Yesterday."

20:02.369 --> 20:03.303
No.
- Yes.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.371
- What planet are you on?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.204
- The planet that the Beatles--

20:05.204 --> 20:06.273
- It is Paul.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.774
It is Paul.
- Oh, all right, well--

20:07.774 --> 20:09.509
- It is Paul, and I feel so
sad that you don't know that.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.610
- We're gonna have
to agree to disagree.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.544
- I guess so.
- Even though I'm right.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.013
- Okay.
- But, um...

20:14.013 --> 20:14.814
- I'm down.

20:14.814 --> 20:15.648
All right, decor.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.953
- We could do classic
black and white.

20:20.953 --> 20:21.788
- Hmm?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.292
Yeah, no, we need to have
like some green and red.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.393
It's Christmas, right?

20:26.393 --> 20:27.894
- Right, you're right.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.331
Do, like, red balloons and
spread 'em across the room.

20:31.331 --> 20:35.702
- Only if we get to dress up
Pennywise as a Santa Claus.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.137
- I'm sorry, did you just
make an "It" reference?

20:39.306 --> 20:40.573
- Yeah, I've seen the movie.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
- Oh, okay, did
you read the book?

20:43.876 --> 20:45.545
- Yeah, when I was a kid.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.346
You?

20:47.514 --> 20:49.482
- Yeah, I read a
couple of his books.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.783
- Which ones?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.452
- Oh, let me think,
all of them, twice.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.053
What?

20:54.053 --> 20:56.523
- He is the reason
that I read as a child.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.157
- Yeah.
- He was my everything.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.892
- Yes, me, too.
- Obsessed with him.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.995
- Totally, totally, well,

21:02.995 --> 21:05.665
your secret's safe with me.
- That's wild.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.799
Thank you.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.401
Your secret's safe with me, too.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.638
Oh, I gotta go.

21:14.040 --> 21:14.874
- Oh, okay.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.576
Okay, yeah.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.247
- Here's our list of your
quotes that you need to get.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.083
Thanks.
- Yes.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.718
- I will see you later.
- Thank you.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.154
And, uh, drive safe.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.690
- Good meeting.
- Good meeting, great meeting,

21:30.690 --> 21:31.758
the best meeting.
- Bye.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.226
Okay, bye.
- Okay.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.497
Drive safe, again.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.333
Oh my God.

21:58.117 --> 22:01.087
- I am, ooh, so
sorry that I'm late.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.522
- No worries.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.956
- Ooh, it's chilly out there.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.661
Oh, is this for me?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.997
- Yeah, cardamom
with honey, right?

22:11.864 --> 22:12.799
- How did you...

22:14.100 --> 22:15.568
Right, the profile.

22:15.568 --> 22:19.572
- So, as a litigator
your job is,

22:19.572 --> 22:23.109
hmm, it's a little
ruthless, right?

22:23.109 --> 22:25.845
You need to go after
people, file lawsuits?

22:27.279 --> 22:30.750
- You know, I actually set
out to be a public defender.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.851
- Really?

22:31.851 --> 22:32.785
What happened?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.186
- I figured out pretty quickly

22:34.186 --> 22:37.256
that I would be paying
student loans until I was 80.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.592
- Come on.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.260
- Well, almost 80.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.296
- I have to admit, I
am still paying mine,

22:44.296 --> 22:46.232
and it feels like
it's never-ending.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.934
- So, why literature?

22:49.101 --> 22:52.472
- Um, because I
love it.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.341
There's really no
greater reason.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.878
- What do you love about it?

23:00.547 --> 23:02.815
- Well, Mr. Litigator,

23:04.250 --> 23:07.286
you use language in
your job, every day.

23:07.286 --> 23:12.291
You use it to persuade, convince,
win your argument, right?

23:12.291 --> 23:13.593
- I guess, yeah.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.295
- That's how you use words.

23:16.295 --> 23:18.798
A writer of literature
uses language

23:18.798 --> 23:20.500
for a different reason, to,

23:23.202 --> 23:26.573
to share with the rest of us
an experience that they've had.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.478
When it works, it is magic.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.449
You get to see things
you've never seen

23:36.449 --> 23:39.218
and feel things that
you've never felt.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.787
You get a new
perspective on the world.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.288
It's like you grow as a human.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
When I have a moment like that,

23:48.561 --> 23:50.630
I have to admit it
makes my spirit soar.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.266
- I love your teeth.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.542
- My teeth?

24:02.542 --> 24:04.944
- Is that weird?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.280
- Yeah.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.055
So, uh, what's the last
novel that you read?

24:17.256 --> 24:20.527
- Um, I haven't read
a novel in a while.

24:22.762 --> 24:23.963
- So what do you read?

24:23.963 --> 24:26.032
- Witness interviews,
depositions,

24:26.032 --> 24:29.401
investigative reports,
tons of discovery,

24:29.401 --> 24:32.471
and then I have to go and read
any case that has bearing.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.473
Case authority is
what we call it.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.976
Motions, filings, briefs,

24:38.645 --> 24:42.414
other boring things like that.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.483
- No, no, just different.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.135
- We have the same phone.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.274
- See, we have
something in common.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.146
- Yeah.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.147
Fair enough.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.355
- Sean?

25:24.390 --> 25:25.858
Sean.

25:25.858 --> 25:26.693
Sean.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.796
- Hey!
- Hi.

25:29.796 --> 25:30.663
- I just got these.

25:30.663 --> 25:31.898
They sound great.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.766
They sound, what?
- That's great.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.168
Holly hasn't called me back yet.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.469
- Don't get involved.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.806
- But it's
their first date.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.207
- Don't get involved.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.441
- Where do you think
he's taking her?

25:42.441 --> 25:44.644
Do you think he
took her dancing?

25:44.644 --> 25:46.412
You used to take me dancing.

25:46.412 --> 25:49.315
- Can this wait until I finish
this level, please, please?

25:53.285 --> 25:55.021
- Finally, well?

25:56.188 --> 26:01.060
- Mm, I suppose he
was intelligent,

26:01.894 --> 26:03.763
just not--

26:03.763 --> 26:05.031
- Funny?

26:05.031 --> 26:09.268
- Oh, I, I guess I
laughed, a little.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.570
- Okay, was he
romantic with you?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.505
- It was a coffee date.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.507
- Okay, was he charming?

26:15.507 --> 26:16.342
- Yeah.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.579
Yeah, but, but
something was off.

26:20.579 --> 26:25.551
When I , he
asked me why literature,

26:25.551 --> 26:27.519
and when I tried to
explain it to him,

26:29.355 --> 26:30.923
it was like trying to
explain quantum physics

26:30.923 --> 26:31.824
to a two-year-old.

26:33.492 --> 26:37.196
He complimented
my teeth.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.030
My teeth!

26:38.030 --> 26:39.065
- No, he did not.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.867
- Not my eyes, my teeth.

26:40.867 --> 26:41.801
- Your teeth?

26:41.801 --> 26:43.602
But you ,

26:43.602 --> 26:45.137
but you hate your teeth.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.405
- I hate my teeth.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.074
- Uh, okay, so I have a theory.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.442
I think the teeth
thing is very weird,

26:50.442 --> 26:53.646
but I believe that this
guy is beautiful enough

26:53.646 --> 26:56.482
and that you should
give him another shot.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.117
- I don't know, dear.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.618
My gut is telling me--

26:59.618 --> 27:00.419
- Sean.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.756
Tell Holly he's beautiful.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.590
Tell, just tell her.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.192
- He's beautiful, Holly.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.126
- Thanks, Sean.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.560
- That's committed, thank you.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.798
So that sounded like
he didn't mean it,

27:11.798 --> 27:14.566
but I believe he did,
and I think this guy is,

27:14.566 --> 27:17.403
like, hot enough,
like, he's stunning,

27:17.403 --> 27:19.538
and that you should
give him another chance.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.607
- Okay, maybe, I will, maybe.

27:21.607 --> 27:24.877
- I feel like you
should say yes before I hang up.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.779
- If it'll get you to stop,

27:26.779 --> 27:29.081
then yes.
- It would.

27:29.081 --> 27:29.916
Thank you.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.617
I love you, bye.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.585
Say yes.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.487
- Yes.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.090
- Do you even know
what I'm saying?

27:38.090 --> 27:39.591
- Huh?
- Good God!

27:41.994 --> 27:42.829
- I love you.

27:53.005 --> 27:53.840
- I woke you up, didn't I?

27:53.840 --> 27:54.874
I'm sorry.

27:55.908 --> 27:56.909
I just wanted to talk.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.044
I hope you don't mind.

27:58.978 --> 27:59.812
- No, it's fine.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.680
Miss!

28:01.680 --> 28:05.051
Hi, uh, black coffee, decaf.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.719
Thank you.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.554
I got your message.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.256
It kinda seemed
like an emergency,

28:10.256 --> 28:11.657
so my mom's watching my kid.

28:11.657 --> 28:12.792
You all right?

28:14.727 --> 28:18.597
- Are you dating anyone,
anyone special in your life?

28:18.597 --> 28:20.666
- Am, am I?

28:20.666 --> 28:23.269
Josh, I haven't
heard from you in years.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.671
You, you called me
with a panicky message

28:25.671 --> 28:28.107
but you, you want to
know about my love life.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.108
Thank you.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.342
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.144
I know it's been a long
time since we talked,

28:32.144 --> 28:34.313
but I just thought this
would be a good opportunity

28:34.313 --> 28:35.982
to catch up.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.718
So, is there anyone
special in your life?

28:41.187 --> 28:45.992
- There is a woman at work
who doesn't know I exist.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.561
She really lights up the room.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.031
- Oh, that's good.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.700
You're a writer, yeah,
a literary writer?

28:54.700 --> 28:55.667
- Allegedly, yeah.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.737
- There's this girl.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.740
Okay, she's smart, but we
don't seem to be connecting.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.610
- That doesn't happen very
often to you, does it?

29:04.610 --> 29:06.545
- Exactly, yeah.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.847
I talk to women all the time.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.749
It works fine, but
not with this one.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.718
She's, she's different.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.422
She says I'm a litigator
so I use language

29:16.422 --> 29:17.790
to convince and persuade,

29:17.790 --> 29:20.226
and apparently, that
doesn't do it for her.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.095
No, she prefers
language that uplifts

29:23.095 --> 29:26.065
and enlightens about
our shared experiences

29:26.065 --> 29:28.134
or some BS like that.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.069
- You know, I'd argue
that that's not BS,

29:30.069 --> 29:31.303
but I hear you.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.073
What, what, what can I do?

29:35.474 --> 29:37.376
- I need something that
, how did she put it,

29:37.376 --> 29:40.679
something that makes you
see what you didn't see,

29:40.679 --> 29:42.348
feel what you didn't feel.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.818
I need help delivering that.

29:46.752 --> 29:47.920
- Has it ever occurred to you

29:47.920 --> 29:49.388
that you guys
aren't a good match?

29:49.388 --> 29:50.823
- No.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.992
Look, a jump start,
that's all I need.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.029
- Well, I don't know.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.564
I could write her
a poem from you.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.001
- Yeah, that's a great start.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.635
- No, I was just
kidding, right there.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.004
I actually couldn't do that.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.105
That's very manipulative.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.173
- Oh, come on, man.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.878
I just need you to get
the pump primed for me.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.345
When you write it,

30:13.345 --> 30:16.482
think about this mystery woman
of yours for inspiration.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.018
Later, I can, I
can do it myself.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.255
- Well, there is this
poem I've been working on,

30:23.255 --> 30:24.991
worked on it this afternoon.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.659
- That's great.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.494
Send it over.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.130
- Hmm, you know
what, I don't know.

30:31.130 --> 30:31.964
That's weird.

30:34.400 --> 30:39.005
- Hey, uh, remember that
position at Southern Edge?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.106
It's still open.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.273
I confirmed it.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.909
Now my recommendation
would put you

30:42.909 --> 30:45.677
at the top of that
list, if not seal it.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.179
And not only would
you be writing,

30:47.179 --> 30:49.748
but you'd have more time
to spend with Molly,

30:49.748 --> 30:50.950
get her into a better school

30:50.950 --> 30:53.920
and maybe even buy
guesthouse for your mom.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.090
- All right, listen,
you and I go way back.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.427
I'll write you the poem.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.694
But, but don't tell
me anything about her,

31:02.694 --> 31:05.097
'cause that would
make it less truthful.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.365
I also want you to
think about what happens

31:06.365 --> 31:07.433
when the poems stop coming,

31:07.433 --> 31:08.935
and she starts asking questions,

31:08.935 --> 31:11.270
because women are much more
intuitive than men, Josh.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.207
I don't think this
is going to end very well.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.043
- You let me worry
about how it ends.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.711
I just need your
help gettin' started.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.316
- Cheers.

31:29.321 --> 31:34.326
- No,
that is ridiculous.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.562
- You're up late.

31:37.796 --> 31:38.730
- It's okay.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.865
Molly's asleep in her room.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
The, uh, landlord called.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.104
- Um,

31:48.307 --> 31:49.575
I'll call her in the morning.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.379
- How can you
say such stupid things?

31:53.379 --> 31:54.780
- What?

31:54.780 --> 31:58.884
- Not you, this guy,
complete nutjob.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.589
S.T.F.U.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.590
- Mom!

32:09.661 --> 32:11.397
- What is Hemingway
trying to say

32:12.931 --> 32:16.235
about the dishonor
of modern warfare

32:17.703 --> 32:19.671
and the protagonist's
imminent doom

32:19.671 --> 32:21.940
during the bloody
Spanish Civil War?

32:23.242 --> 32:24.076
Anyone?

32:26.712 --> 32:30.282
Oh, come on, guys, even
Metallica wrote a song about it.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.283
- I know Metallica.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.754
Lost in Vegas reacted
to one of their songs.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.027
You don't know Lost in Vegas?

32:45.464 --> 32:47.133
They're pretty cool.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.401
- That's time.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.073
I want you guys to
look up the song,

32:54.073 --> 32:55.907
by Metallica, "For
Whom the Bell Tolls".

32:55.907 --> 33:00.146
I want 500 words on how
it does or does not relate

33:00.146 --> 33:01.980
to the themes in
Hemingway's novel.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.482
And I want it for Thursday.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.816
It will be graded.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.266
- Yeah?

33:20.266 --> 33:21.200
Oh, hey.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.134
- Hey.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.335
- Ooh, what's happening?

33:25.371 --> 33:27.005
- Listen to this.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.274
- What?

33:28.274 --> 33:31.177
- "She is sunlight
on my cave of ice.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.478
"She is a mystery.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.779
"She is fire,

33:33.779 --> 33:36.982
"piercing eyes and
an ancient soul.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.586
"She awakens me.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.020
"She challenges me.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.491
"Something stirs.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.525
"I grow."

33:48.127 --> 33:49.628
- Ooh.
- Uh-huh.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.930
- Who, Josh?

33:51.930 --> 33:53.799
- That's
his name at the end.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.504
- Wow.
- I--

33:58.504 --> 34:01.207
- "Piercing eyes and
an ancient soul."

34:03.709 --> 34:06.678
That is, that is impressive.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.879
And I'm jealous.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.348
That's what just happened.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.616
Take it away.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.650
- No, but for real, I
honestly cannot believe

34:12.650 --> 34:16.621
that the same guy I had
coffee with wrote this.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.324
- It seems like a
different person,

34:18.324 --> 34:22.893
and I can't believe that I
can't find a Christmas present

34:22.893 --> 34:24.163
for my own husband.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.431
- Why are you stressing
out so much about this?

34:28.167 --> 34:33.172
- Sean and I are officially
in couple's therapy.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.710
- I'm sorry,
honey, I didn't know.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.147
Is it working?

34:42.181 --> 34:45.217
- Honestly, I have no idea.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.552
- That bad, huh?

34:48.487 --> 34:49.788
- Possibly.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.857
- Hey, come here.

34:51.857 --> 34:52.690
Come here.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.460
It's gonna be okay.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.395
It will.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.264
- Hey, your office hours start

34:58.264 --> 34:59.865
in like two minutes, right?

34:59.865 --> 35:01.133
- Yes, they do.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.480
- Shadows stretch yields
before the blue sky.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.115
It retreats.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.218
Light spills over
the edge of her eyes.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.888
Her words ease the
burden, and I let go.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.424
Her embrace steadies me.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.796
And it gives me, it gives me,

35:31.997 --> 35:33.732
it gives me--
- Hey.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.066
- Hey, hi, hello.

35:35.066 --> 35:35.901
Hi.
- Hi.

35:36.735 --> 35:37.569
So sorry.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.407
Were you, were you performing?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.575
- I was doing a
writing exercise.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.311
- Oh.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.313
- Did you, did you hear that?

35:47.313 --> 35:49.515
- Ah, yeah, just a little.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.082
No, it was really good.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.353
- Well, thank you.

35:54.353 --> 35:57.423
Uh, uh, what's up?

35:57.423 --> 35:59.024
What's up with you?

35:59.024 --> 36:00.158
- I just came by to let you know

36:00.158 --> 36:02.861
that I am free tomorrow
for our meeting.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.696
- Great, then I'll
see you tomorrow,

36:04.696 --> 36:06.565
and I see you now too,

36:06.565 --> 36:08.133
but tomorrow, I'll see you too.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.503
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:25.484 --> 36:28.053
- Thank you for what
you wrote to me.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.289
It was really nice.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.290
I liked it.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.724
- You did?

36:32.724 --> 36:33.992
I'm glad.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.627
- So it seems you are a writer.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.563
- Oh, I am not.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.966
I just, you inspired me.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.169
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.275
- Well, it was beautiful.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.714
So how are things
going with your case?

36:55.714 --> 36:58.083
- I think we have
the upper hand,

36:58.083 --> 36:59.985
but we're still in
the discovery phase.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.921
We won't know for sure what
we've got until that's complete.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.025
We had this one deposition
yesterday where,

37:07.025 --> 37:09.127
I can't really talk about it.

37:09.127 --> 37:12.097
- Good at
keeping secrets, huh?

37:13.164 --> 37:14.700
- What do you mean?

37:14.700 --> 37:15.901
- Occupational hazard.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.936
- Oh , right.

37:17.936 --> 37:18.770
I'm sorry.

37:19.771 --> 37:22.040
So what are you working on?

37:22.908 --> 37:25.143
- Oh, just the Christmas formal.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.679
- Oh, what's that?

37:27.679 --> 37:29.948
- It's an end-of-the-year
event for faculty.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.583
I'm setting it up.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.151
- Well, that sounds nice.

37:33.151 --> 37:33.985
- Yeah.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.489
You could come if you like.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.858
We could go together.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.394
- That sounds great.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.463
I would love to.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.968
- Great.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.842
- Look,
Daddy, I'm beautiful.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.276
- Yes, you are, honey.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.711
Is that grandma's makeup?

37:59.711 --> 38:01.046
- Maybe.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.147
- Okay, where's grandma?

38:02.147 --> 38:03.849
- She's yelling at her iPad.

38:03.849 --> 38:04.816
- Oh, okay.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.853
- Oh, who's that?

38:07.853 --> 38:09.187
- This is Dr. Willinger.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.524
- Is she a real doctor,
or a doctor like you?

38:12.524 --> 38:14.125
- We're both real
doctors, silly.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.227
- Hi, Molly.

38:16.227 --> 38:18.797
- Are you and my
dad going on a date?

38:20.399 --> 38:23.335
- No, we're, we are
working together.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.270
- All right, Molly, go
find Grandma, please.

38:25.270 --> 38:26.705
- Okay, love you, Daddy.

38:26.705 --> 38:27.539
- I love you, too, kiddo.

38:29.274 --> 38:30.709
- God, she is so cute.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.910
- Yes, thank you.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.211
- Your mom lives with you, too?

38:33.211 --> 38:35.481
- She has for the
last couple years.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.015
- That's, that's nice.
- Yeah.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.251
- Look, I hate to be rushing us,

38:40.251 --> 38:41.587
but I have a class
in 10 minutes.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.921
- Oh.
- Where'd we leave off?

38:42.921 --> 38:45.023
- I heard from Ivo's.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.124
That's their quote.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.359
What do you think?

38:47.359 --> 38:49.661
- Wow, that's a
really good price.

38:49.661 --> 38:50.496
- Yeah.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.332
- Would you mind if I go
check it out before we commit?

38:54.332 --> 38:56.468
- No, of course, and also
I wanted to tell you,

38:56.468 --> 38:57.736
you'll be happy to know,

38:57.736 --> 39:00.472
my cousin Nicole is
booked that evening,

39:00.472 --> 39:02.140
so she's unavailable.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.375
- That's really funny,

39:03.375 --> 39:05.377
because you actually
had me come around

39:05.377 --> 39:07.112
on the idea of a DJ.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.046
- Really?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.280
I could find another deejay.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.549
- No, I don't want to
over-complicate things.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.883
Just, we're good
with the playlist.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.552
- Okay.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.120
- Do you know who
you're going with yet?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.022
- Oh, to the party?

39:17.022 --> 39:19.625
Uh, I hadn't thought of anybody.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.692
I mean, the only
woman I can think

39:20.692 --> 39:22.494
of has a bedtime of 7 p.m.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.697
- Hey, so, we have to
go to the supply store

39:25.697 --> 39:26.998
and get some party stuff.

39:26.998 --> 39:27.966
- Definitely, we have to.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.167
It's a date.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.472
- Oh, yeah, it's a date, sure.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.107
Um, uh, you want to go,
you want to go tomorrow?

39:36.107 --> 39:38.444
- I can't do
tomorrow but text me.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.978
We'll work it out.

39:39.978 --> 39:40.946
- Oh, oh, okay.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.313
- Good job.
- Thanks.

39:42.313 --> 39:43.515
- I'm excited about
this restaurant.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.850
- Yeah, me too,
good job to you too.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.084
- All right.
- It's gonna be,

39:46.084 --> 39:48.386
gonna be a great party.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.355
- I think these speakers
are perfect for him, though.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.758
He really doesn't like
the way the TV sounds.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.496
Oh, he's here, have
fun tonight, bye.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.830
- Ah!

39:58.830 --> 40:00.799
- Hey.
- Hey, you gotta hear these.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.534
- What are those?

40:03.435 --> 40:04.436
- Check 'em out.

40:06.672 --> 40:07.506
What?

40:07.506 --> 40:08.339
- Nothing.

40:13.579 --> 40:17.115
Those aren't the same clothes
you were wearing earlier.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.951
- Yeah, I changed at the gym.

40:19.951 --> 40:23.689
- When did you start
going to the gym?

40:23.689 --> 40:25.156
- Last week.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.424
You okay?

40:26.424 --> 40:27.258
- Yeah.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.328
I'm taking a bath.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.031
- Do you want me to--
- No.

40:49.314 --> 40:50.281
- Thank you.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.119
Could I ask you a question?

40:55.420 --> 40:56.221
- Of course.

40:58.423 --> 41:03.328
- Where did piercing eyes
and ancient soul come from?

41:04.996 --> 41:06.364
- Well, I don't know.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.198
I told you.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.734
You just inspired me.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.437
- I mean, I can
write academic papers

41:12.437 --> 41:15.373
and analytical essays all
day long, but that kind of,

41:16.575 --> 41:19.645
that kind of thing,
that poetic writing,

41:19.645 --> 41:23.181
where an idea and an
image just explode,

41:26.417 --> 41:27.919
where does that
come from for you?

41:27.919 --> 41:28.787
How do you do it?

41:30.689 --> 41:33.659
- I just grab a pen,

41:34.893 --> 41:35.994
and it, uh...

41:39.197 --> 41:40.031
What?

41:41.099 --> 41:42.400
Now?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.201
- Sure.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.539
- I, I don't even
have a, uh, uh, uh,

41:50.108 --> 41:52.343
a pen, great.

41:52.343 --> 41:56.948
Honestly, I write
better with the keyboard.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.051
- Well, there's a
keyboard on your phone.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.424
I don't mean to put
you on the spot.

42:06.424 --> 42:10.829
I just, I want to see
your mind at work.

42:12.263 --> 42:15.333
That kind of creativity
is, I find it fascinating.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.535
I want to know your process.

42:18.403 --> 42:19.805
What goes through your head?

42:23.274 --> 42:25.243
- I'll be honest.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.879
This, it just isn't my process.

42:29.615 --> 42:31.082
- Well, use that then.

42:32.250 --> 42:33.451
I want to hear your
internal monologue

42:33.451 --> 42:35.186
as you're finding the words.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.890
- Internal monologue?

42:38.890 --> 42:41.492
I just don't really
work that way, though.

42:41.492 --> 42:44.162
I mean, writing is a,
it's a solitary thing.

42:44.162 --> 42:46.497
It's, it's not a
performance skill.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.234
- Yeah, you're right.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.135
I'm sorry.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.054
- Can I see?

43:22.033 --> 43:25.370
You're kidding, right?

43:25.370 --> 43:26.437
- What, what?

43:33.945 --> 43:35.781
- You're telling me that
he wrote you the lyrics

43:35.781 --> 43:37.048
to "Stairway to Heaven"?

43:37.048 --> 43:38.950
- I like him.

43:38.950 --> 43:39.885
- Shut up, Sean.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.187
- I feel terrible.

43:42.187 --> 43:43.421
I mean, I pressured him.

43:43.421 --> 43:45.123
He told me that he
didn't like to write

43:45.123 --> 43:46.925
in front of other people,
which is, you know,

43:46.925 --> 43:48.927
it's completely, it makes sense.

43:49.795 --> 43:50.996
- Okay.

43:50.996 --> 43:52.731
Okay, well, Mozart wrote some

43:52.731 --> 43:54.833
of the best music the
world's ever heard,

43:54.833 --> 43:57.235
and he couldn't
hold a conversation.

44:02.107 --> 44:04.075
- You know who else
makes good cookies?

44:04.075 --> 44:07.145
Grandma, and she's
headed home now.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.080
- So was Mom.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.515
- Yeah.

44:10.515 --> 44:12.383
Ah, lifesaver.

44:12.383 --> 44:13.685
I gotta run.
- Oh.

44:13.685 --> 44:17.422
I got your suit pressed,
in case you need it.

44:19.457 --> 44:21.592
What on earth happened here?

44:22.694 --> 44:25.697
- Daddy made the
lumpiest cookies ever.

44:25.697 --> 44:30.702
- Lumpy cookies
for his little monkey.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.283
- Oh, that's good.

44:45.283 --> 44:46.117
- Thanks.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.564
Hold on.

44:59.564 --> 45:01.199
- Ooh, ooh, is that a text?

45:01.199 --> 45:02.300
Was that him?

45:03.468 --> 45:04.736
- Yeah.

45:04.736 --> 45:05.670
- What did he
say, what did he say?

45:05.670 --> 45:07.005
What did he say?

45:07.005 --> 45:08.206
- Oh my God.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.541
He wrote me the sweetest
goodnight text ever.

45:10.541 --> 45:11.376
- Aww.

45:13.779 --> 45:15.881
- So where do you come
up with this stuff?

45:17.749 --> 45:18.850
- I'm a writer.

45:18.850 --> 45:20.651
You know, I create.

45:20.651 --> 45:21.486
It's what I do.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.824
- Is this about
that mystery woman?

45:28.894 --> 45:30.295
- Kinda.

45:30.295 --> 45:31.129
She's amazing.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.267
- The first since Nancy?

45:38.336 --> 45:40.305
- Maybe the first time,
half the time, 0.5.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.673
I think about her all the time.

45:42.673 --> 45:44.609
She doesn't know I exist.

45:44.609 --> 45:45.877
- Well, why not tell her?

45:47.879 --> 45:48.814
- I'm gonna tell her.

45:48.814 --> 45:50.081
I mean, I want to tell her.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.482
I don't want to keep
hiding it from her.

45:51.482 --> 45:54.285
- Just be honest
and be up front.

45:54.285 --> 45:55.954
Show her who you truly are.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.459
That's always worked for me.

46:06.464 --> 46:11.469
- I just wish he
could be like this in person.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.072
It's like I'm dealing
with two different people.

46:15.573 --> 46:16.774
- Yeah, that's not okay.

46:20.245 --> 46:22.881
- I just gotta get him to
open up when were together.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.615
- Tell him.

46:26.051 --> 46:26.885
- Mm-hmm.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.997
- She's asking why my writing
is so much better than--

46:38.997 --> 46:40.398
- Spoken word?

46:40.398 --> 46:41.833
That's easy, writing
comes from the heart.

46:41.833 --> 46:43.634
It takes time.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.604
I mean, when we write things
down it's more precise.

46:46.604 --> 46:47.839
It lasts longer than anything

46:47.839 --> 46:49.440
that just comes
out of our mouth.

46:56.714 --> 46:57.515
Sorry.

46:58.783 --> 46:59.650
Oh.

46:59.650 --> 47:00.451
Hi, Mom.

47:01.953 --> 47:02.921
Oh, yeah.

47:03.788 --> 47:04.622
Okay.

47:05.790 --> 47:06.824
Okay, bye.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.493
I gotta go.
- Uh, David,

47:08.493 --> 47:09.995
I need another favor.

47:14.765 --> 47:15.700
- Really, dude?

47:15.700 --> 47:16.667
- What?

47:16.667 --> 47:17.903
- You like him already?

47:17.903 --> 47:19.470
It's "Stairway to Heaven."
- What?

47:29.714 --> 47:31.149
- I haven't been this nervous

47:31.149 --> 47:32.650
since my first
month of law school.

47:32.650 --> 47:34.552
- Don't worry, I'll be in
your ear the whole time.

47:36.888 --> 47:38.589
- Why's your shirt off?

47:38.589 --> 47:40.391
- Well, don't you
need to wire me up?

47:43.128 --> 47:45.663
- No, we got the
Bluetooth headphones.

47:45.663 --> 47:46.497
- Oh.

47:50.435 --> 47:51.369
- Josh.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.737
- What's up?

47:52.737 --> 47:53.905
- Just, shirt.

47:54.739 --> 47:55.740
- Oh, right.

48:02.747 --> 48:05.783
- Honey, Daddy has
some important work

48:05.783 --> 48:07.052
to do with Uncle Josh,

48:07.052 --> 48:08.753
so do you promise me
you'll stay in here?

48:08.753 --> 48:09.887
- Yes.

48:09.887 --> 48:10.855
- Do you promise?

48:10.855 --> 48:12.123
- I promise.

48:12.123 --> 48:14.159
- Okay, okay, thank
you, good girl.

48:24.835 --> 48:26.938
Josh, I'm getting,
like, some static here.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.874
- It's windy today, huh?

48:29.874 --> 48:30.808
- Mm-hmm.

48:30.808 --> 48:32.643
- Is it supposed to snow?

48:32.643 --> 48:33.644
- I don't know.

48:33.644 --> 48:35.146
I hope we have a
white Christmas.

48:35.146 --> 48:37.248
- Me too, I, uh, I love snow.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.883
- Stop, stop talking
about the weather.

48:38.883 --> 48:41.452
That's what people talk about
when they have nothing to say.

48:41.452 --> 48:42.387
- Okay.

48:42.387 --> 48:43.554
- What?

48:43.554 --> 48:45.390
- Oh, nothing.

48:45.390 --> 48:49.427
- Just say, I find
the juxtaposition

48:49.427 --> 48:51.929
of white snow and red
leaves compelling and--

48:51.929 --> 48:54.365
- I find the juxtaposition

48:54.365 --> 48:58.003
of white snow on red
leaves to be compelling.

48:59.137 --> 49:00.538
- I wonder why we
find it so beautiful.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.173
What is the
evolutionary purpose?

49:02.173 --> 49:04.709
Okay, you've got the bare
trees of winter, which--

49:07.112 --> 49:09.580
- Take the bare trees of winter,

49:09.580 --> 49:11.983
they're not much to
look at on their own.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.120
But if you add some fallen snow,

49:16.521 --> 49:21.226
it transforms it into something
majestic, a beautiful vista.

49:22.693 --> 49:25.096
- I've never thought
about it like that.

49:25.096 --> 49:26.931
- Yeah, it makes you
think of other things,

49:26.931 --> 49:30.601
or people even, who could,
with a little effort--

49:30.601 --> 49:34.239
- With a little effort,
transform into something else.

49:36.907 --> 49:40.411
- Hmm, there's a,
there's a metaphor

49:40.411 --> 49:45.083
in that or maybe some
symbolism, I think.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.552
Maybe I'll have to add it

49:47.552 --> 49:49.487
to my next year's
curriculum.

49:50.455 --> 49:51.289
- What?

49:51.289 --> 49:52.123
What, what?

49:54.059 --> 49:55.460
What?

49:55.460 --> 49:56.861
- What?

49:56.861 --> 49:57.795
- You gotta get closer man.

49:57.795 --> 49:58.763
I can't hear her.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.165
What'd she say?

50:00.165 --> 50:01.899
- I just said maybe
I'll have to add it

50:01.899 --> 50:03.234
to next year's curriculum.

50:03.234 --> 50:05.970
- Oh, I heard you.

50:05.970 --> 50:07.505
- Me, you heard me?

50:07.505 --> 50:09.107
- No.

50:09.107 --> 50:09.907
- Are you okay?

50:11.309 --> 50:12.477
- I'm sorry.

50:12.477 --> 50:15.380
I'm just a little
stressed from the case.

50:15.380 --> 50:16.614
- Oh.

50:16.614 --> 50:18.683
- Could we just sit
down over there?

50:19.817 --> 50:22.087
- Yes, of course.
- Oh, please.

50:40.105 --> 50:42.573
- What is on your face!

50:42.573 --> 50:43.841
- What is on your face?

50:46.144 --> 50:47.578
- What?

50:47.578 --> 50:49.247
- Oh, Josh, I'm sorry.

50:49.247 --> 50:51.182
I forgot to hit the mute button.

50:51.182 --> 50:52.283
- I'm sorry.

50:53.184 --> 50:54.752
That was just a bad joke.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.488
- About my face?

50:57.488 --> 50:59.090
- What, did you get
mugged by a chocolate bar?

50:59.090 --> 51:00.458
What's going on here?

51:00.458 --> 51:01.426
- No, no, no, no, no.

51:01.426 --> 51:03.394
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.662
- What is it?

51:04.662 --> 51:05.796
Just tell me what's
on it, I'll get it--

51:05.796 --> 51:06.731
- Nothing.
- I'll get it off.

51:06.731 --> 51:08.733
- There's nothing, really.

51:08.733 --> 51:09.867
- Don't, don't, don't, sorry.

51:09.867 --> 51:11.436
Stop, listen.

51:11.436 --> 51:12.437
Sorry, I got tripped up.

51:12.437 --> 51:13.638
Just say--

51:13.638 --> 51:14.905
- I just got a
little tripped up,

51:14.905 --> 51:16.674
but what I wanted to say is,

51:16.674 --> 51:20.378
what is it about your
face that just undoes me?

51:21.779 --> 51:23.748
The shape and symmetry.

51:26.251 --> 51:27.785
- Well, thank you.

51:29.387 --> 51:32.857
I'm glad that you
find me symmetrical.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.626
Symmetry is good.

51:37.128 --> 51:39.330
I find you
symmetrical, too, Josh.

51:39.330 --> 51:40.165
- Yeah.

51:41.432 --> 51:42.267
Thanks.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.004
- You're all sticky.

51:47.004 --> 51:48.038
I'm gonna have to
clean you all up.

51:48.038 --> 51:49.340
- You're all sticky.

51:49.340 --> 51:51.142
I'm gonna have to
clean you all up.

51:51.142 --> 51:51.942
- Josh!

51:52.810 --> 51:54.111
What?
- I--

51:54.111 --> 51:54.979
- Boop.

51:54.979 --> 51:56.247
- I am so sorry.

51:58.149 --> 51:59.950
- I think I need to,

51:59.950 --> 52:02.086
I think I'm gonna get going.

52:02.086 --> 52:03.921
- I didn't mean to be risque.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.958
- Yeah, I'm, I'm not
ready for that yet.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.227
- I love you, Daddy.

52:09.227 --> 52:10.728
- I love you, Honey.

52:10.728 --> 52:12.430
- I love you, too.

52:12.430 --> 52:13.664
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

52:13.664 --> 52:15.400
Don't, don't say
that, no, no, no.

52:15.400 --> 52:16.234
- You what?

52:17.101 --> 52:18.203
- Oh, God.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.506
- I love you?

52:23.140 --> 52:24.074
- You do?

52:32.350 --> 52:36.086
- I know it seems soon, but
I don't wanna lie to you.

52:37.355 --> 52:39.624
I want you to know
how I feel about you.

52:40.925 --> 52:44.662
- Uh , but it's,

52:45.796 --> 52:47.298
I'm not ready to say that yet.

52:48.733 --> 52:52.703
- Do you think you would
be ready, one day, maybe?

53:03.013 --> 53:04.282
- I'm gonna go.

53:05.216 --> 53:06.651
I'll see you.

53:13.658 --> 53:15.159
- Oh, boy.

53:23.468 --> 53:25.303
- Emily, where's Sean?

53:29.240 --> 53:30.608
Well, we should reschedule.

53:31.642 --> 53:33.744
- Yeah, okay, that's fine, yeah.

53:33.744 --> 53:34.979
Thank you.

53:34.979 --> 53:35.513
- Have a good day, Emily.
- Sorry.

53:35.513 --> 53:36.314
Thanks.

53:47.258 --> 53:49.193
- Hey, sorry, I'm late.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.162
What are you--
- Don't.

53:53.798 --> 53:55.065
I'm sorry, too.

54:11.148 --> 54:12.650
- Dad, is that me?

54:13.884 --> 54:14.719
- Yes, it is.

54:14.719 --> 54:15.886
That is you.

54:15.886 --> 54:18.055
- Mommy was really pretty.

54:19.724 --> 54:20.991
- She was.

54:20.991 --> 54:22.993
You know, she was a
lot more that that.

54:22.993 --> 54:25.396
- I miss having her
here at Christmas.

54:27.031 --> 54:28.333
- You do?

54:28.333 --> 54:29.934
- She made cookies way better

54:29.934 --> 54:31.235
than you do.

54:31.235 --> 54:33.338
- Yes, she did make
them better than I do.

54:34.372 --> 54:35.540
- I miss your smile.

54:35.540 --> 54:37.875
You're sad too much.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.711
- You don't think I smile?

54:40.711 --> 54:42.212
- Not like you used to.

54:44.782 --> 54:47.418
You did when talking
to your friend at work.

54:47.418 --> 54:48.285
She seems nice.

54:49.253 --> 54:51.489
- She is very nice.

54:51.489 --> 54:52.523
Go hang that up.

55:05.269 --> 55:06.737
Hello?

55:06.737 --> 55:10.508
Um, yeah, do you guys
have reservations tomorrow

55:10.508 --> 55:11.409
at seven o'clock?

55:12.543 --> 55:13.378
You do?

55:14.712 --> 55:16.647
Can I get two for
David Martin, please?

55:17.882 --> 55:18.683
Thank you.

55:19.584 --> 55:20.418
Bye.

55:27.492 --> 55:29.193
- Why are you smiling like that?

55:29.193 --> 55:31.161
- Smiling like what,
like this?

55:31.161 --> 55:32.329
- That's ridiculous.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.664
- You're ridiculous, come here.

55:38.369 --> 55:39.937
- Autonomy.

55:39.937 --> 55:43.708
Because of her, I'm
kind of doing this now.

55:43.708 --> 55:46.744
My sister
is so maddening.

55:46.744 --> 55:49.580
She won't stop talking
about her pregnancy.

55:49.580 --> 55:51.215
- Well, it's kind of a big deal.

55:53.283 --> 55:54.118
- Well, I know.

55:55.252 --> 55:57.021
It just seems like a lot of work

55:57.021 --> 56:00.124
and a lot of responsibility.

56:00.124 --> 56:02.226
Whole thing kinda
gives me anxiety.

56:03.694 --> 56:07.632
Well, what was it like
becoming a father, I mean?

56:07.632 --> 56:09.434
- You know, before
Molly was born,

56:10.768 --> 56:11.936
I thought it'd be really great

56:11.936 --> 56:13.971
to be the first
voice she ever heard.

56:15.272 --> 56:18.242
And I wanted to say
something profound

56:18.242 --> 56:20.711
like Neil Armstrong's
man on the moon moment.

56:20.711 --> 56:25.716
And, uh, my wife was in
labor for a really long time,

56:26.584 --> 56:31.556
and, like, after 18 hours--

56:31.556 --> 56:34.492
- Oh, that's a really long time.

56:34.492 --> 56:35.693
- Yes, I said it
was a long time,

56:35.693 --> 56:38.262
and it sort of
happened real fast

56:38.262 --> 56:40.064
and, all of a sudden,
there she was.

56:41.499 --> 56:46.504
She's being born, and
it was so complex.

56:47.237 --> 56:47.838
It was so beautiful.

56:48.739 --> 56:49.974
I'm not a religious person,

56:49.974 --> 56:51.375
but it's the first time
in my life I believed

56:51.375 --> 56:52.610
in God without question.

56:54.445 --> 56:56.614
- So what'd you say to her?

56:56.614 --> 56:58.583
- I didn't say anything.

56:58.583 --> 57:00.084
I was too busy crying
to say anything.

57:00.084 --> 57:02.252
And my wife held
her in her arms.

57:02.252 --> 57:04.188
She looked down at
her and she said.

57:04.188 --> 57:05.322
"Oh, you're so pretty."

57:06.624 --> 57:08.659
And I couldn't top
that, so I didn't try.

57:11.896 --> 57:13.564
And I loved her in an instant.

57:14.765 --> 57:17.935
And I realized how
self-centered I had been

57:19.504 --> 57:20.971
and Molly brought
me out of that,

57:20.971 --> 57:22.206
to have this little
person there,

57:22.206 --> 57:25.209
who is completely
dependent on you, just,

57:27.144 --> 57:28.178
she's my whole world.

57:28.178 --> 57:29.313
She's all of it.

57:36.754 --> 57:37.822
- We're here.
- Yeah.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.990
- That was beautiful.
- Thanks.

57:39.990 --> 57:42.259
I'll get this stuff out.

57:42.259 --> 57:43.093
- Yeah.

57:58.208 --> 58:01.411
- Oh, hey, by the
way, you were right.

58:01.411 --> 58:03.313
"Yesterday" was written by Paul.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.182
I can't believe I
didn't know that.

58:05.182 --> 58:06.083
It's kind of my song.

58:06.083 --> 58:07.752
So congratulations.

58:09.219 --> 58:11.822
- In a 100 years, people are
still gonna know that song.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.057
I'm sure of it.

58:13.057 --> 58:14.291
It's one of those
pieces of creativity

58:14.291 --> 58:15.225
that will just live
forever, you know.

58:17.461 --> 58:21.231
Hey, did you ever decide who
you're bringing to the formal?

58:21.231 --> 58:23.568
- Yeah, I thought about
it and I got somebody.

58:23.568 --> 58:25.002
I just haven't asked 'em yet.

58:26.236 --> 58:28.105
- Well, what's stopping you?

58:28.105 --> 58:31.108
- Just waiting for
the right moment.

58:32.376 --> 58:36.714
- You must never hesitate.

58:36.714 --> 58:39.249
- Is that Sean Connery
from "The Rock"?

58:39.249 --> 58:41.285
- Yeah, it's so bad.
- That's amazing.

58:41.285 --> 58:42.452
- No.
- That was really good.

58:42.452 --> 58:43.487
- It's
really, really bad.

58:43.487 --> 58:44.288
- No, it was really good.

58:45.690 --> 58:47.524
- Thanks, no, but seriously,
you shouldn't wait,

58:47.524 --> 58:49.493
because you don't know
if it'll be too late.

58:49.493 --> 58:53.297
Take it from somebody
who is a waiter, me,

58:53.297 --> 58:56.533
not a waiter at a restaurant,
a person who waits.

58:56.533 --> 58:57.735
You get what I'm saying.

58:59.870 --> 59:03.540
I just, I just had an idea.

59:03.540 --> 59:04.942
- Do you want

59:04.942 --> 59:05.475
to go to the dance--
Would you wanna double date,

59:05.475 --> 59:06.176
What?

59:06.176 --> 59:07.211
- Uh, what?

59:07.211 --> 59:08.445
You, you, you go first.

59:08.445 --> 59:13.250
- Oh, I said maybe you
and whomever you decide

59:14.685 --> 59:17.021
to take to the formal and
me and my new boyfriend,

59:17.021 --> 59:20.224
we could go get a
drink, before or after.

59:20.224 --> 59:22.593
- Yes, yes.

59:22.593 --> 59:23.661
Cool.

59:23.661 --> 59:25.029
- Yeah.
- Huh.

59:25.029 --> 59:27.364
- Come on, let's get
this stuff put together.

59:27.364 --> 59:28.899
- You, uh, you go ahead.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.768
I need to make a quick phone
call, so I'll be right back.

59:30.768 --> 59:31.602
- Okay.

59:38.976 --> 59:42.546
- Hi, I had a reservation
for two tonight at 7:30,

59:42.546 --> 59:43.881
and I can't make it.

59:43.881 --> 59:45.415
Martin is the name.

59:46.851 --> 59:48.385
No, I don't need to reschedule.

59:49.353 --> 59:50.187
Thank you.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.694
- If I fail them
all, I get fired.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:01.331
- Hey.
- Hey, you,

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.800
what are you doing here?

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.301
- I was coming to tell
you that I don't need you

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:07.237
to cover my class, 'cause my
dinner plans got canceled.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.306
- Oh, I prepped an entire thing

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:10.741
for "Midsummer Night's Dream."

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:11.942
- Yeah.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.243
- I haven't taught
it since grad school,

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:15.445
'cause I'm a maths teacher.
- Well, right,

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.613
I'm so sorry.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.548
It's funny, "Midsummer
Night's Dream,"

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.184
Molly dressed up as
Puck for Halloween.

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:21.886
How crazy is that?

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:23.253
- If you don't show me
pictures of that right now,

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:24.855
I'm gonna spontaneously combust.

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:28.025
Oh my, look at the face.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.495
She's very, she's a happy Puck.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:32.529
Oh!

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:34.564
- Oh, sorry.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:37.935
Hey, hey, I gotta
call you back, okay?

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:38.836
All right, bye.

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:43.040
- How do you know, um, how
do you know Josh Wright?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.241
That's Holly's boyfriend.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.912
I was telling you about
him, the guy on the app.

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:50.347
- Oh, uh, Holly
Weiss in accounting?

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:51.648
- No, who's that?

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.618
- Holly Fanzler in IT?

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:57.722
- How many Holly's
are in this school?

01:00:57.722 --> 01:01:01.258
No, my Holly Willinger,
the professor,

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.161
the one with blond
hair and glasses,

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.095
been at my wedding.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.463
You've seen her loads of times.

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:07.798
You're doing the
Christmas formal with her.

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:09.033
How's the color scheme going?

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:10.567
Have you decided?

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:11.802
You okay?

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:12.903
- I gotta go.
- What happened?

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.371
You good?
- Talk to you later.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.153
- David, you never called
me back last night.

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:35.760
- I'm done.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.094
I can't do it anymore.

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:39.864
- With Holly?

01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:42.232
- With Holly, yeah.

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:43.734
- I'm sorry.

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:46.236
I should've told you she was
a professor at the school.

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:49.874
I know it was probably
unethical, what you did.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:50.707
- What I did?
- Yeah.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.675
- What we did.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:54.111
It's what we did.

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:55.846
Anyway, it's over so,
goodbye, Josh, good luck.

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:57.882
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
just slow down,

01:01:57.882 --> 01:02:00.851
'cause actually, I
have some good news.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:04.254
I just got off the phone with
Southern Edge University.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.189
- Sure, you did.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.524
- Oh, check the call history.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:08.993
I just spoke to Cori Johnson.

01:02:08.993 --> 01:02:12.062
She's their recruiter,
and she wants to meet you.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:12.997
- She wants to meet me--

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:15.099
- I'm not pressuring you, David.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:17.234
You make your own decisions.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:19.804
I'm just asking you
for one last time.

01:02:19.804 --> 01:02:22.172
- You're not going to hold
this job thing over my head?

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:23.607
- Absolutely not.

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:24.775
I did what I could.

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:27.144
Now she's coming up to meet you,

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:28.779
and the rest is
on your shoulders.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.936
- Can you even hear me from
all the way down there?

01:02:51.936 --> 01:02:53.403
- What?

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:56.173
- I said, can you even--
- No, I was kidding.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:59.109
I have a ton of papers to grade,
because it's finals, so...

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.212
- You okay?

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:04.748
- Yeah.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.317
- You don't seem okay.

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.252
- I really do.

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:09.453
I have a lot of papers to grade.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.022
- You said that.
- I'm not lying.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:17.061
- Oh, okay, well, we
can just cancel this--

01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:17.895
- Okay.

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.466
- So how was your day?

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.035
- It was busy.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:01.171
The Christmas formal
is coming up fast.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.807
Could we listen to
some Christmas music?

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:04.641
- Sure.

01:04:23.127 --> 01:04:25.362
You remind me of my mother.

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:31.735
- That's
incredibly weird.

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:33.737
- Why?

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:37.641
- Never mind, Josh.

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:41.245
- Actually, I prefer Joshua.

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:47.751
- You want me to
call you Joshua?

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:48.618
- If you would.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.657
- Sure, Joshua.

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.503
- Are you okay?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.872
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.776
I just have to get used

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:14.711
to the two different
versions of you, you know,

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.417
the litigator, the
writer, Josh, Joshua.

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:24.521
It's confusing.

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:28.592
- I'm working on it.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:35.699
Excuse me.

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:03.427
Call David Martin.

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.670
- "Sunlight on my cave of ice,"

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:49.906
what a metaphor.

01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:52.008
It's brilliant.

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:54.311
- That's beautiful.

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:55.845
Did you just write that for me?

01:06:58.048 --> 01:06:59.649
- No.

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:00.450
- What?

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:02.852
- Forget something?

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:05.622
- No, I've got it right here.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:07.591
- That's mine.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:10.960
- The phone?

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.965
- What, were you just
calling Christa or Gabrielle?

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.135
- What?

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:20.304
No, I was actually just
trying to call David.

01:07:20.304 --> 01:07:21.171
- With my phone?

01:07:24.108 --> 01:07:25.209
You took my phone.

01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:29.146
- Oh, no.

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:31.248
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.452
- I can explain.

01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:39.089
- I couldn't help but
notice these text messages

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:43.193
with beautiful prose
and imagery and diction,

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.829
from David!

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:47.531
- I really can explain.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:51.000
- And then the same
beautiful prose and imagery

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.269
and diction and text messages

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:56.840
to Christa and Cori
and, uh, Gabrielle.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:04.080
That's why you've been two
completely different people.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.416
- No, no, no, no, I was
just having him proofread--

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.584
- Stop lying.

01:08:10.254 --> 01:08:14.090
Wow, you are a colossal jerk,

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.961
for having someone
ghostwrite a soul for you

01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:19.529
that you obviously
don't possess,

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.899
an even bigger jerk for
taking what you stole

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:27.904
and mass-marketing it to
persuade any woman you want

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:31.140
that you're actually
a human being.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.542
- Look, wait, just let me--
- Which you're not.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:38.582
You're subhuman,
artificial unintelligence.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:43.420
I can't believe I,

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.823
I fell for this, I mean--

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.292
- I know, I know, and I'm sorry,

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.127
so just--
- Oh my God, no.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:54.798
I'm done.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:14.951
Not now, Carol.

01:09:22.426 --> 01:09:23.260
Hey!

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:27.063
- We bought a house.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:30.267
- Oh , that's great.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.201
- It's amazing.

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:32.736
I mean, we couldn't have done it

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:35.339
if Mom and Dad didn't help
us with the down payment.

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:38.242
- Well, I'm, I'm
so happy for you.

01:09:38.242 --> 01:09:40.910
- Oh, and the baby's room
is absolutely perfect.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.679
I designed it myself.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.781
I cannot wait to show you
and your new boyfriend

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.283
when you come for Christmas.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:51.220
- Yeah, um ,
about that, um--

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.323
- He's a lawyer, right, Holly?

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.692
You can not let this
one get away, okay?

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.061
He could support you for
the rest of your life.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.275
- Okay, I'll see
you guys on Monday.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.198
You know?

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.201
- Yeah, I do.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:39.035
How could you?

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:39.869
- I'm sorry.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:40.670
I had no idea.

01:10:42.205 --> 01:10:43.773
- That was just so wrong.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.509
- I know, and I'm sorry.

01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:47.477
- I feel so stupid.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:48.645
- I meant every word.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:50.246
- What is that supposed
to mean, David?

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.781
- I wrote those letters to you.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:54.784
- What are you trying to say?

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:58.087
- I wrote every word,
thinking about you.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.223
I had no idea who
Josh was seeing.

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.760
- So you're some kind of
modern Cyrano de Bergerac

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.994
and I'm your Roxane?

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.763
- Dante had Beatrice.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:07.864
Petrarch had Laura.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:10.300
I had you.

01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:15.672
You told me not to
hesitate, remember?

01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:16.506
I did.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:20.777
I'm not hesitating anymore.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.145
- So I was your muse?

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.914
- Hey, you call it whatever.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.616
You filled me up.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:28.452
You lit a fire inside of me.

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:32.288
I woke up and I came
alive when I met you.

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:36.192
Sunlight on my cave of ice.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:39.629
Yeah?

01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:42.332
You did that.

01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:48.237
- But that's
not giving, David.

01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:51.274
That's, that's not love.

01:11:51.274 --> 01:11:54.043
That's, that's using.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:57.013
You , you used
to be in some kind

01:11:57.013 --> 01:11:59.048
of stupid game with
your bro roommate.

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:04.454
I don't care what you do.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:05.288
I'm done.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.303
- Hey, sorry, I'm late.

01:12:20.303 --> 01:12:23.907
I had some eggnog, and I forgot
I was lactose intolerant.

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:24.774
I won't describe
the rest to you,

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:27.210
but it was, uh, not fun.

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.579
Do you think I could
help you, please?

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.716
- Just leave me alone, okay?

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:37.020
Just go blow up some
balloons or something.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:03.713
* You walked into my life

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.783
* Like a ray of light

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:11.788
* Didn't know what to do

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.860
* I couldn't see
just what was real *

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.964
* And all the
things that I feel *

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:25.969
* Couldn't say to you

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:30.339
* Guess I loved you
at first glance *

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.946
- So your gut instinct was
right about Mr. Wright?

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:41.551
- I can't believe that I
fell for that superficial,

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:45.655
soulless, Popsicle, pretty boy.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.727
All I want to do is crawl
into my bed and never leave.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:52.929
- Oh, honey.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:56.432
- And you know, the
weirdest part of it is,

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.202
I can't believe that David
Martin went along with it.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:02.639
- I'm sure Josh litigated
him into submission.

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:09.345
But, David wrote
those words about you,

01:14:10.714 --> 01:14:13.750
and they came from
his heart, Holly.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:14.951
He's sorry.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.786
He didn't know
Josh was with you.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.287
- It doesn't make it right.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.958
- I agree.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.694
- I mean, they
were nice, though.

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:29.766
- What were nice, the poems?

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.300
Did you keep the poems?

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.536
Were the poems nice?

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:37.974
- I mean, they were nice, yeah.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.011
- Can I read them?

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.114
- Yeah.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:52.488
* If you're not with me

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:55.224
- Wow.

01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.296
* Don't feel the same

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:02.365
* I spend my day reflecting

01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:04.133
- Wow, they...

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:09.973
Well, this is a gift, Holly.

01:15:11.575 --> 01:15:13.276
Honey, you still hesitating?

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.011
Okay.

01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:20.684
Let me put it in words that
you will definitely understand.

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:24.988
You have spent years reading

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:27.857
and admiring dead
writers, correct?

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:32.028
Okay, well, now it looks
like you might actually have-

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.731
- A live one, I know.
- Yes, yes,

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:37.300
with a pulse and a soul, Holly.

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:40.970
- I've just never,

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.040
I've never thought
of him that way.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.474
He's a friend.

01:15:46.442 --> 01:15:48.077
- Okay, just my humble opinion,

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.681
these words were written
by an attractive man

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:55.919
with a soul, and they were
written from his heart.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:56.753
Listen to me.

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:03.392
I'm sorry that I steered
you in the wrong direction,

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.260
because I did.

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:07.463
But it's not too late, okay?

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:10.667
* I spend my day
reflecting who *

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.869
- Too late for what?

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:13.903
- To get it right!

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:20.844
Holly, go home, forget Josh,

01:16:20.844 --> 01:16:25.849
he never even existed,
and reread these poems,

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.117
because they are
written by David,

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:30.419
and they are literally to you.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:40.964
- He's having
lunch at Eileen's.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.267
- Okay.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.373
- David, thank
you so much for coming.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:51.841
I know it's finals week.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:54.110
- Oh well, you know,
it is a busy time.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.412
- So I have some questions.

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:57.647
- Okay, fire away.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.749
- How do you know Josh?

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.651
- That's an easy question.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:02.919
Thank you.

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:03.953
Josh and I went to
college together.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.689
We were roommates in college,

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:07.724
so I've known him a long time.

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:09.859
- I didn't know that.

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:11.360
- How do you know Josh?

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:13.930
- I met him in
Cabo, two years ago.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:14.998
He was on vacation.

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:16.499
- Oh, yeah, on vacation, okay.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.236
- Yeah, but he was very sad.

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:21.871
His friend's wife had died.

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:27.176
I guess that's when
we began dating.

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:29.245
- You dating, okay.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.214
- Yeah, he got me the
job at Southern Edge.

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:32.381
He's such a great guy.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.085
- Oh, you're dating now?

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:39.422
- Yeah, lately, he blew me away

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:40.724
with some of the
things he wrote.

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:42.892
I mean, that's why when
he recommended you,

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:45.328
I thought it means
something coming

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:46.830
from a writer like Josh.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.768
- Yeah, a writer like Josh.

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.803
Well...
- Yeah.

01:17:53.803 --> 01:17:55.671
Have you read any
of his latest work?

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.044
- Josh, the brilliant
writer, that's interesting.

01:18:01.044 --> 01:18:02.879
- You didn't know he wrote?

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:06.950
- No, but Josh is a very
surprising, surprising guy.

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.085
He's a brilliant,
surprising guy.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.787
Can I get a drink?

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:12.621
Do you, would you like a drink?

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:29.138
- I'm so naive.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:40.516
- Going somewhere?

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:44.253
- It's the end of the semester.

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:45.088
I'm packing up.

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:47.556
- Let me carry those.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:49.625
- They're empty.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.194
- Well, still, it
looks bad if I don't.

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:58.701
You know, you never gave me
a chance to say I'm sorry.

01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:00.804
- It wouldn't have mattered.

01:19:00.804 --> 01:19:01.737
- I know.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.206
I deceived you.

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:06.675
I was supposedly this
fun, witty, charming guy,

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:10.279
but around you, I was, I was
complimenting your teeth.

01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:12.048
- And a fine set
of teeth they are.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.119
- I was really looking
forward to meeting Carol

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:17.821
and the rest of your family,

01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:19.956
winning them over,
proving my worth to you.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.926
- By hiring someone
to write poetry,

01:19:22.926 --> 01:19:24.894
so you can plagiarize it?

01:19:24.894 --> 01:19:26.595
I mean, how fake is that Josh?

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.897
Think about it.

01:19:27.897 --> 01:19:30.533
- The feelings weren't
fake, aren't fake.

01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:33.669
The formal is tonight.

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:36.539
I could still take
you, if you let me.

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:38.041
- Have you spoken to David?

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.442
- No, no, I set him up

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:41.444
on an interview
yesterday at Eileen's,

01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:44.113
and I've just stayed out
of his way, since then.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.581
- An interview?

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:48.051
- Yeah, Southern
Edge University.

01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:49.886
Yeah, I think he's
getting out of here.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:54.190
So what do you say?

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:55.358
Can I take you tonight?

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:57.560
- I'm sorry.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.677
- Thank you, Santa.

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:54.183
- Hey, how you doin'?

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.518
Good to see you guys, hey.

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.887
Hey, what's up, man?

01:20:57.887 --> 01:20:59.055
Thank you for coming.

01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:00.123
How are you?

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:01.925
Hi.
- Hi, great party.

01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:02.858
- Thank you.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.027
Glad you came.

01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:06.896
- Very funny.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.097
I wouldn't say very funny
out loud, but it is.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:09.698
- Oh no, no.
- It really is.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:28.918
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:31.354
The Math Department
in the house.

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:34.023
- How are you doing?

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:35.491
Congratulations, it
all looks perfect.

01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:37.860
- Oh thank you.
- I like the red balloons.

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.694
- Yeah.

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:45.868
- Hey.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:48.337
What's wrong?

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:52.808
- Passing off David's
poetry as your own,

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:56.345
not just once, but again
and again, with other women?

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.488
- And then you dangle a job

01:22:05.488 --> 01:22:08.124
to bribe your ghostwriter
into helping you?

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:11.560
- It's, it's not
what you think, okay?

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:17.433
- You're unbelievable.

01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:19.168
- What?

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:23.872
Gabrielle, I was gonna call ya.

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:24.707
- Jerk.

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.645
- Christa, well, you look...

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:31.647
Oh, not the margarita.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:32.481
- Liar.

01:22:34.817 --> 01:22:37.486
- Ugh, that's, that's sticky.

01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:50.666
Erin?

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:00.743
- I saw that coming.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:03.179
- I didn't.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.781
- You should have.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:09.952
- You're right.

01:23:11.687 --> 01:23:13.122
- Merry Christmas.

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:30.606
- Hello.

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:32.108
- David.

01:23:32.108 --> 01:23:33.442
- Hey, Josh.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.578
- I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

01:23:35.578 --> 01:23:38.114
It was wrong to dangle the job.

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:38.947
I apologize.

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:46.422
- Well, it's Christmastime, so
peace on earth and good will

01:23:46.422 --> 01:23:48.224
to everyone,
including you, Josh.

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.428
Anyway, I'm not
gonna take the job.

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:55.331
- I'm sure it's still
available, if you want it.

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:56.932
You let me know, if
you change your mind.

01:23:56.932 --> 01:23:59.502
I'll help, no strings.

01:23:59.502 --> 01:24:01.036
- No, I think I'm good here.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:03.038
- Well, all right, then.

01:24:04.107 --> 01:24:04.973
One last thing,

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:08.211
Holly's the one for you.

01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:09.745
I know.

01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:12.415
She's the girl of
your dreams, so run,

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:13.649
go out there and get her.

01:24:13.649 --> 01:24:15.351
Don't let her get away.

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:18.821
Merry Christmas, David.

01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:21.490
- Merry Christmas, Josh.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:44.380
- Oh, Mrs. Gunderman, have
you seen Professor Martin?

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:48.151
- No, I believe he and
his date went that way.

01:24:49.218 --> 01:24:50.219
- His date?

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.191
- Oh, oh, where are you going?

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:59.195
No, you're not leaving, come on.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.299
- Oh, where were you going?

01:25:03.299 --> 01:25:06.001
- I wanted to go
change my shoes.

01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:07.470
- Why?

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:12.475
- Because I am wearing these
for someone who is here

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:15.077
with someone else
and I'm just ,

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:20.483
I'm confused, and I
feel stupid, once again.

01:25:20.483 --> 01:25:22.985
- Holly, why do you think
David's here with someone else?

01:25:22.985 --> 01:25:24.520
- Mrs. Whats-Her-Name said

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.089
that he took his
date to the bathroom.

01:25:27.089 --> 01:25:29.124
- Sorry.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.526
- His date.

01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:31.827
How is that possibly funny?

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:32.761
- I'm so sorry.

01:25:32.761 --> 01:25:33.996
Honey, will you trust me?

01:25:33.996 --> 01:25:35.498
I think you'll have
a really good time

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:36.532
if you just stay a little bit.

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:37.800
What?

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.134
- Shh, dance with me.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.726
Remember when I
missed those meetings?

01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:04.560
- Yeah.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.661
- This is why.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.995
- Well, I feel bad.

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.064
- Good.
- That's so sweet.

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:29.051
- Oh, it's the second
prettiest girl at the dance.

01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:30.986
- Who's the prettiest?

01:26:30.986 --> 01:26:32.655
- You, of course, duh.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.493
- Your daddy has you out
late tonight, huh, Molly?

01:26:37.493 --> 01:26:38.461
- It's holidays.

01:26:38.461 --> 01:26:40.496
He said he needed a date.

01:26:40.496 --> 01:26:44.300
- Well, I have to say you
are the most beautiful date

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.768
that he will ever have, ever.

01:26:47.336 --> 01:26:50.105
- Dad, you can
take her on a date.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.242
- Oh, okay.

01:26:53.242 --> 01:26:54.643
- Take her to the zoo, Dad.

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:57.079
- Let's take her
to the zoo, Molls.

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:58.146
- Well, hey there, Molly.

01:26:58.146 --> 01:26:59.482
Do you want to come with me?

01:26:59.482 --> 01:27:00.416
Let's go find something fun.

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:01.884
What did you ask Santa for?

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:04.987
- So.

01:27:06.389 --> 01:27:07.222
- Um,

01:27:10.693 --> 01:27:12.060
I want you to know
that every word I wrote

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.196
in those letters was about you,

01:27:16.265 --> 01:27:17.866
every thought, every syllable.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:22.471
It was about you,
'cause you, you, um,

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:25.374
you make me feel alive again.

01:27:31.314 --> 01:27:35.318
You know, you make me feel joy.

01:27:35.318 --> 01:27:37.786
You make me want to--

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:39.187
- I'm sorry, David.

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:41.490
- Oh, it's okay.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:42.391
I understand.

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:45.260
- No, no, I'm,

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:48.431
I'm sorry, 'cause
you're gonna have

01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:51.233
to meet my really annoying
sister at Christmas ,

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:54.670
if you're willing,
you and Molly.

01:27:59.408 --> 01:28:00.208
- Yeah.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.213
I just, I just--
- Shh.

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.148
Less words.

01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:17.626
- I'll talk
here with my wife.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.528
With you, I talk
with my mouth open.

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:22.965
* Christmas bells
all around town *

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:27.370
* But nothing compares
to the sound *

01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:30.839
* Of my laughter
when you're around *

01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:34.943
* All the snowflakes
gather in the street *

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:38.847
* And my heart skips a beat

01:28:38.847 --> 01:28:42.117
* 'Cause it's cold outside,
but I feel the heat *

01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:44.887
* I'm runnin' in
circles in my mind *

01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:48.591
* 'Cause I'm so happy
that you're mine *

01:28:48.591 --> 01:28:51.960
* Can't find the words to say

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.329
* How you make my holiday

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:58.133
* I've never felt this way

01:28:58.133 --> 01:29:00.168
* And, baby, that's okay

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:03.005
* My heart beats still faster

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:06.108
* 'Cause you're my ever after

01:29:06.108 --> 01:29:09.645
* Try to find the words to say

01:29:09.645 --> 01:29:12.080
* How you make my holiday

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.551
* Can't find the words to say

01:29:15.551 --> 01:29:19.388
* How you make my
hol, make my holiday *

01:29:19.388 --> 01:29:23.125
* I've never felt this way

01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:25.193
* And, baby, that's okay

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:28.063
* My heart beats still faster

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:31.066
* 'Cause you're my ever after

01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:34.002
* Just you and me

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:37.039
* You're all I ever need

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:40.576
* Can't find the words to say

01:29:40.576 --> 01:29:44.613
* How you make my
hol, make my holiday *

01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:49.618
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ah, ah, ah, yeah *

01:29:50.819 --> 01:29:55.123
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

01:29:56.324 --> 01:30:00.963
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:05.834
* I've never felt this way

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:09.004
* You make my holiday
