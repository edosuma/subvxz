WEBVTT

00:04.620 --> 00:06.638
Miss Lemon! Let me help you out.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.060
Thanks, Kenneth.

00:08.379 --> 00:10.800
What are all these little
plastic containers for?

00:10.969 --> 00:13.929
Are you pickling squirrel meat?
Cause I can lend you my skull presser

00:14.361 --> 00:18.051
No, I went to the new
flagship compartment store on 5th Avenue

00:18.176 --> 00:21.056
and got everything I need
to get my life in order.

00:21.471 --> 00:25.065
A stacker thing to separate junk mail
from your humidifier catalogs.

00:25.234 --> 00:28.526
A thing you stick on your laptop
that holds your keys.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.192
A round plastic deal
that holds your shoes

00:31.435 --> 00:33.243
with a pocket for a photograph

00:33.368 --> 00:35.218
of what shoes are in there.

00:35.954 --> 00:37.868
I'm going to become wonderful.

00:37.993 --> 00:39.543
It's a new beginning.

00:39.744 --> 00:41.874
- Like a phoenix rise...
- Look out!

00:42.973 --> 00:43.834
Or...

00:44.402 --> 00:46.921
maybe this is gonna be
the worst day ever.

Episode 314:
"The Funcooker"

01:07.234 --> 01:08.534
Morning meeting.

01:08.659 --> 01:10.694
Everybody shut up.
Shut up, Lutz.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.196
Already today,

01:12.364 --> 01:14.955
I have lost faith in decor-ganizing,

01:15.080 --> 01:16.282
chipped a tooth...

01:17.507 --> 01:20.157
And lost a shoving match
to what I thought

01:20.446 --> 01:22.651
was a female bike messenger.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.294
So I am asking all of you
for the next 12 to 14 hours

01:26.419 --> 01:29.045
to just be cool.
Let's have a normal day.

01:29.215 --> 01:32.101
- Guys, seriously, be cool.
- Why are you not wearing pants?

01:32.226 --> 01:35.301
They still have the heat set for winter,
and my office is boiling.

01:35.471 --> 01:36.594
Put on your pants!

01:38.057 --> 01:40.098
Please make me
a dentist appointment today.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.643
You can't go today.
You have jury duty.

01:42.873 --> 01:45.347
What? No!
I'm registered in Illinois.

01:45.553 --> 01:47.188
How did New York find me?

01:47.358 --> 01:49.470
I changed
your voter registration for you.

01:49.885 --> 01:52.235
What's wrong?
You told me to be more proactive.

01:52.958 --> 01:55.633
I told you to buy more Proactiv!

01:57.412 --> 02:00.218
Mr. Donaghy wants to see you now
about what Jenna and Tracy did

02:00.343 --> 02:01.911
during St. Patrick's day parade.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.651
Was it something good?

02:04.914 --> 02:06.816
Have a seat. It was very simple.

02:06.941 --> 02:10.211
I asked you two to host NBC's
coverage of St. Patrick's day parade.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.674
Read the cue cards. Promote the show.
So would you explain to Mr. O'Cannon

02:14.165 --> 02:16.010
why it went so very wrong?

02:16.178 --> 02:18.511
Sir, as I'm sure you know
from reading my blog,

02:18.680 --> 02:20.889
I'm currently shooting
a feature film inspired by,

02:21.058 --> 02:23.767
but, for legal reasons,
not based on Janis Joplin.

02:24.116 --> 02:28.106
<i>Synonym's just another word
for the word you wanna use</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:31.544
we can't sing the original songs,
but it's gonna be phenomenal.

02:31.669 --> 02:34.297
But, between the movie at night
and working here during the day,

02:34.422 --> 02:35.772
I am so exhausted.

02:36.135 --> 02:37.782
So when I got to the parade...

02:37.950 --> 02:39.864
That's no excuse, ye banshee.

02:39.989 --> 02:43.052
You and this gravy face
have slarneyed up

02:43.177 --> 02:44.577
a real donnybrook.

02:45.353 --> 02:47.208
<i>Here comes the County Cork steppers.</i>

02:47.376 --> 02:49.738
<i>Their traditional dance
celebrates the spirit</i>

02:49.863 --> 02:52.313
<i>and the ingenuity
of the Irish people.</i>

02:54.273 --> 02:55.778
<i>Wake up, mother...</i>

02:58.408 --> 02:59.848
You're a disgrace.

03:00.610 --> 03:03.494
Passing out and cursing
on St. Patrick's day?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.142
Is nothing sacred?

03:06.312 --> 03:08.440
I should be rewarded
for going this long

03:08.565 --> 03:10.439
without swearing on live TV.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.650
The FCC disagrees. They've decided
to make an example of you

03:13.834 --> 03:16.820
- and fine you personally $50,000.
- 50 grand?

03:17.370 --> 03:19.155
Can anyone cut this in half?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.742
Look at you! I told you.
You're spreading yourself too thin.

03:22.912 --> 03:25.204
- I only heard the thin part.
- Lemon is right.

03:25.329 --> 03:28.248
Obviously, you can't do
both TGS and Janie Jimplin.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.584
I choose the movie.
My face is bigger on it.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.920
I don't mean quit,
Liz will find a way to make both work.

03:34.104 --> 03:35.092
Am I right?

03:35.217 --> 03:37.466
I'll have to use you less
in the show.

03:37.877 --> 03:40.844
And I'll scale back the movie.
We could cut the lesbian scene.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.513
But the Oscars love
that kind of thing.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.390
There's 2 guys in my gym
named Oscar.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.585
You have got to start
taking care of yourself.

03:47.710 --> 03:48.810
You're a wreck.

03:48.979 --> 03:49.979
I am fine.

03:51.358 --> 03:53.147
Jenna, that's a glue stick.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.150
You're going to the doctor.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.735
OK, great meeting.

04:01.515 --> 04:04.276
Let's try to have a calm week
downstairs, shall we?

04:04.401 --> 04:05.702
Yes, I'm trying.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.057
I don't need any distractions.
On Friday,

04:08.182 --> 04:10.657
Microwaves is announcing
a very big project

04:10.782 --> 04:12.732
or, should I say, very little?

04:13.652 --> 04:15.087
The pocket microwave?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.464
You can buy it on Friday
along with everyone else.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.389
It has a ham button.
You used my idea!

04:21.973 --> 04:24.809
I understand what it's like
having too much on your plate.

04:24.934 --> 04:28.225
Between medical practice and this job,
I'm pulled in every direction.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.602
What can I do, doctor?
Haven't been this tired

04:30.727 --> 04:33.313
since I was forced to do
that dance marathon in Dubai.

04:33.483 --> 04:35.415
I can give you
these pamphlets on stress

04:35.540 --> 04:38.690
and diet and doing a movie
and a TV show at same time.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.772
But they're all gonna tell you
that you need to give something up.

04:41.897 --> 04:43.328
And they're wrong.

04:43.608 --> 04:45.533
You can burn the candle
at both ends.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.518
Go on.

04:46.643 --> 04:48.923
My lab works is in the field
of sleep research.

04:49.048 --> 04:51.623
Mostly because I checked
the wrong box on a form once.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.541
We are current working on a pill

04:53.710 --> 04:56.247
that keeps people awake
under any circumstances.

04:56.372 --> 04:59.522
It's being funded
by the U.S. Military and the WNBA.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.509
- Does it work?
- It's kept my lab rats awake for days.

05:03.115 --> 05:05.970
- But we're looking for human subjects.
- Where do I sign up?

05:06.362 --> 05:08.662
Please, we don't want a paper trail.

05:11.722 --> 05:14.437
Take 25 of these a day
for the rest of your life.

05:17.278 --> 05:20.279
I am going to jury duty,
but I will be right back.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.028
I got my princess Leia outfit,

05:22.197 --> 05:25.031
some Playgirl magazines
from the early 1980s.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.283
They will dismiss me
immediately as a weirdo.

05:27.472 --> 05:29.916
- Who's in charge while you're gone?
- Let's see.

05:30.041 --> 05:32.164
Pete is spending spring break
with his kids,

05:32.415 --> 05:33.414
so no one.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.883
No one here is in charge in any way.

05:36.406 --> 05:37.996
If no one's in charge,

05:38.121 --> 05:40.580
who will yell at me
for goofing up the lunch order?

05:40.705 --> 05:42.882
We all will, Kenneth.
We all will.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.859
You guys are my best friends.

05:50.191 --> 05:52.934
There you are!
You wanna buy half a watch?

05:53.104 --> 05:54.936
I have to pay my fine in cash.

05:55.167 --> 05:58.022
I guess FCC stands
for Federal Bunch of Sticklers.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.608
I hope you've learned
a lesson from this.

06:00.778 --> 06:01.710
I sure have.

06:01.835 --> 06:04.144
I learned that if you pay
some money afterwards,

06:04.269 --> 06:06.114
you can say whatever you want on TV.

06:06.297 --> 06:09.409
I can even say what Ernest Borgnine
whispered to me at...

06:09.579 --> 06:11.035
Stop. That's not the lesson.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.840
That's always the lesson.

06:13.397 --> 06:15.832
If you have money,
you can do whatever you want.

06:16.174 --> 06:18.837
Now I'm off to appear
on Martha Stewart live.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.211
It's gonna be raunchy.

06:22.949 --> 06:23.999
Great news.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.510
I'm in the clinical trial
for a military-grade anti-sleeping pill.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.079
Of course you are.

06:29.204 --> 06:32.154
Now I can still be on the show
as much as you want and do the movie.

06:32.279 --> 06:33.891
Look how much energy I have.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.345
Come on, guys. I just have to go
and get out of jury duty,

06:37.470 --> 06:39.932
and we can talk
about all of this when I get back.

06:43.746 --> 06:45.074
I thought you left.

06:45.199 --> 06:46.200
Listen to me.

06:46.325 --> 06:49.366
I am not asking you this as the boss
you love to undermine,

06:49.534 --> 06:52.452
but as the friend whose birthday
you love to forget.

06:53.156 --> 06:55.888
Just be normal sauce
for like two hours.

06:56.537 --> 06:57.387
Please.

06:57.889 --> 06:59.327
I will be right back.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.353
And I don't really think
it's fair for me

07:04.478 --> 07:06.967
to be in a jury
because I'm a hologram.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.677
You seem fine to me.
Report to jury room B.

07:10.172 --> 07:11.429
Charles what now?

07:17.714 --> 07:19.933
The subject's unusually thirsty.

07:23.112 --> 07:24.859
Everyone shut up.
Shut up, Lutz.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.278
- Where's Lemon?
- She went to get out of jury duty.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.072
Can we get lunch from McDonald's?

07:30.455 --> 07:31.992
I need your creative input.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.495
I've spent the better part
of last 3 years developing

07:34.663 --> 07:36.537
a portable,
miniature microwave oven.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.041
Most of that time has been spent
focused on coming up

07:39.209 --> 07:40.764
with a hip name for the product,

07:40.889 --> 07:42.795
that will appeal
to the marketing holy trinity:

07:42.963 --> 07:45.171
college students, morbidly obese,
and homosexuals.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.076
Unfortunately,
legal just informed me

07:47.201 --> 07:49.828
that the name we settled on
for our bite-size microwave,

07:49.953 --> 07:51.969
the bitenuker,
is highly offensive to those

07:52.139 --> 07:53.596
who speak French or Dutch.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.474
A Franco-Dutchman
would pronounce it "bet nyuker."

07:57.103 --> 07:58.351
Zat's awful.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.561
I'm sorry,
miss Laroche-Van Der Hoot.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.366
This product rolls out in 2 days.

08:02.491 --> 08:05.024
We're in danger of losing
the European market.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.861
Everyone here needs
to brainstorm new names.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.905
Starting today, you are all members
of the microwave division.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.200
- We should make t-shirts!
- Yes. And you're in charge of that.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.910
Remember, this isn't TGS, guys.

08:16.286 --> 08:18.381
Let's not shoot
for the middle this time.

08:21.053 --> 08:22.503
Absolutely not.

08:27.119 --> 08:28.919
Excuse me, imperial guard,

08:29.271 --> 08:32.219
how long do these arson trials
typically last?

08:33.014 --> 08:34.654
Couple of weeks, probably.

08:34.779 --> 08:36.282
You can drop the voice.

08:36.552 --> 08:39.559
This used to get me out of jury duty
in Chicago all the time.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.227
This ain't Chicago, honey.
Look at these people.

08:47.535 --> 08:48.484
Studio 6H.

08:49.052 --> 08:51.455
- It's Liz.
- Where are you?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.115
The pig spoor has hit
the wind spinner.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.565
<i>Mr. Jordan cussed at Martha Stewart,</i>

08:56.690 --> 08:58.907
Miss Maroney drank all
the water out of the toilets.

08:59.032 --> 09:01.461
And I keep starting to sneeze,
but nothing comes out.

09:01.586 --> 09:04.125
What?
Does anyone there listen to me?

09:04.295 --> 09:07.068
It's not my fault.
You didn't put anyone in charge.

09:07.193 --> 09:08.601
<i>I've been put on a jury.</i>

09:08.726 --> 09:11.191
I'll head up there as soon
as we are dismissed for the day.

09:11.316 --> 09:13.614
Try not to let anything else
bad happen.

09:17.009 --> 09:18.159
I'm in charge.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.101
Attention, everyone.

09:22.505 --> 09:25.268
All menstruating women go home
immediately.

09:28.886 --> 09:31.402
He's been doing that
for almost eight hours,

09:31.571 --> 09:32.571
Dr. Vicky.

09:33.102 --> 09:35.094
You know what I like to do
for 8 hours?

09:35.219 --> 09:37.033
The TV guide crossword puzzle.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.626
Give me your hand.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.079
Now look into my eyes.

09:41.940 --> 09:44.124
Now let's try one
where you're not...

09:44.725 --> 09:46.685
- clawing at the window.
- I don't think so.

09:46.810 --> 09:48.085
This feels more natural.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.465
- You're saying, "give me your hand."
- This is what my character would do.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.109
You're back.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.299
Guess I'm not in charge anymore.

10:04.918 --> 10:05.768
Guys?

10:06.660 --> 10:08.212
I've got a couple hours.

10:13.104 --> 10:15.447
- Where is everybody?
- They're all dead.

10:16.254 --> 10:19.575
They're all dead unless they come up
with a name for my pocket microwave.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.077
They're up in my office,

10:21.246 --> 10:22.791
where there are fewer...

10:23.127 --> 10:24.081
foosballs.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.665
So who's writing the show?

10:25.834 --> 10:28.502
Now that you're back,
I thought you could do it yourself.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.921
How hard can it be?
"Hey, I'm rapping Obama".

10:31.089 --> 10:33.969
"Welcome to another episode
of robot/bear talk show".

10:34.094 --> 10:36.732
I'm Josh doing an impression
of De Niro as an auctioneer.

10:36.857 --> 10:39.428
"Do I hear $1,000?
Do I hear $1,000?"

10:39.598 --> 10:40.638
Really good!

10:40.808 --> 10:43.809
Jenna fills in time with a song.
"Good night, good night". Mild applause.

10:44.159 --> 10:45.909
You'll be done in an hour.

10:46.299 --> 10:47.623
In the meantime,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.856
any ideas for microwave names?

10:51.145 --> 10:54.569
The small wonder.
The micromate. The porta-hotty.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.347
If you're not going to take this
seriously, then do your job.

10:57.472 --> 10:59.699
Write the show, and more important,
deal with Tracy.

10:59.868 --> 11:03.835
How? That guy's got enough money
to pay FCC fines for the next 200 years.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.205
Forget the fines.
I've dealt with the FCC.

11:06.379 --> 11:09.064
And NBC is issuing an apology
on Tracy's behalf.

11:09.189 --> 11:11.585
Your problem is
your advertisers are pulling out.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.483
- My god. With no ads...
- No ads, no TGS.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.558
No TGS...

11:15.800 --> 11:18.102
I see you self-publishing your novel

11:18.227 --> 11:20.137
and moving back in
with your parents.

11:21.278 --> 11:22.763
I'll go talk to Tracy.

11:26.031 --> 11:27.601
Just catching up on some work.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.686
Really?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.229
What sounds more shocking?

11:31.733 --> 11:32.606
Or...

11:35.778 --> 11:37.945
Here you go. Everything's OK.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.242
No, just because you have money
doesn't mean you can say

11:41.367 --> 11:43.744
whatever *** thing that you want.

11:46.321 --> 11:49.053
This has gotten bigger
than you just paying fines.

11:49.178 --> 11:51.433
Our sponsors are pulling out
because of you.

11:51.558 --> 11:54.545
And if we don't have advertisers,
they're gonna pull the plug on TGS.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.422
Think about how
you're hurting the crew.

11:56.592 --> 11:59.133
I don't want to hurt the crew.
I love the crew.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.179
All we do is joke around together

12:01.304 --> 12:03.262
about our stupid boss, Liz Lem...

12:05.225 --> 12:06.500
Anyway, unless you know

12:06.625 --> 12:09.952
an advertiser that really wants
to be associated with this,

12:10.152 --> 12:11.395
you need to stop.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.614
Great idea.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.982
Which part are you talking about?

12:15.152 --> 12:16.299
The first 2/3.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.382
I don't need to stop being myself

12:18.638 --> 12:20.641
if I am the advertiser.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.031
I have the money.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.750
I'll just buy up all the ads

12:23.875 --> 12:26.132
and let that hilarious
Tracy Jordan character

12:26.474 --> 12:29.120
- do whatever he wants.
- Put the phone down. You can't do that.

12:29.245 --> 12:31.457
- Jack won't let you.
- We'll see about that.

12:32.399 --> 12:36.175
I need you to set up a meeting with you
and the folks from ad sales.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.173
What do you mean
you're not in charge anymore?

12:42.598 --> 12:45.951
Tracy Jordan from Tracyco
called to invite you to a luncheon

12:46.076 --> 12:49.059
- celebrating their new ad campaign.
- What... seriously, not now.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.277
All right, everyone,
back to the drawing board.

12:51.402 --> 12:53.393
Legal rejected all of our ideas.

12:53.518 --> 12:55.981
Every names we came up with
was offensive in some language.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.550
Including English.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.223
They knew what a Hot Richard was?

13:00.462 --> 13:03.740
So we're going to think
outside the box a little bit here.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.034
I'm going to pick some random letters
from this bag of Scrabble tiles.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.219
Let fate choose a name for us.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.003
Why don't we start over?

13:19.109 --> 13:22.095
I have an idea. Why don't I just
pull them all at once?

13:25.744 --> 13:27.247
Why don't we take a break?

13:27.372 --> 13:29.474
Could you get Lemon
on the phone for me, please?

13:31.208 --> 13:32.258
Ms. Gaulke,

13:32.857 --> 13:34.838
how long have you been an employee

13:34.963 --> 13:36.565
of Mailboxes Plus?

13:36.920 --> 13:38.904
I've been an assistant manager there

13:39.029 --> 13:40.579
for over seven years.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.817
And how would you describe the events
that took place there on December 17th?

13:45.116 --> 13:46.490
The night of the fire.

13:46.779 --> 13:49.568
Christmas was always
a very busy time at the store.

13:50.133 --> 13:54.070
Throw in a late Hanukkah and the fact
that I work in a "Kwanzaa neighborhood",

13:54.195 --> 13:56.667
and it all made
for a very stressful day.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.921
I sent Malik uptown
for more 18-inch boxes,

14:00.089 --> 14:02.221
but he returned unrepentant

14:02.707 --> 14:04.217
with 12-inch ones.

14:05.985 --> 14:08.554
Christine was late,
as well as Harry S.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.015
They said it was a problem
with the subways,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.268
I suspect they were doing
sex with each other.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.858
How many employees
do you have, Ms. Gaulke?

14:15.983 --> 14:17.746
I supervise 12 employees,

14:17.871 --> 14:20.900
most of whom would be
unemployable in any other field.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.199
They are selfish,
irresponsible people

14:23.324 --> 14:25.613
who I know talk about me
behind my back.

14:25.783 --> 14:29.674
They seem to think that their job
is wasting my time and energy

14:29.799 --> 14:32.498
by making their every
minuscule problem

14:32.623 --> 14:34.246
my personal responsibility.

14:34.650 --> 14:35.748
They don't care.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.876
And don't even get me started
on Tracy and Jenna.

14:39.589 --> 14:42.380
And when the last one of them
trundled off that night,

14:42.717 --> 14:45.714
I smelled the air,
and I could feel that it was time.

14:46.783 --> 14:48.385
Time for a new beginning.

14:48.664 --> 14:52.353
And I knew that this was possible
only through a cleansing fire.

14:53.263 --> 14:55.017
It would all have to burn.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.479
The packing peanuts,
the delivery slips...

14:57.647 --> 15:01.232
All of it would dance
in the warm mouth of my fire.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.658
And a new, better, wonderful me

15:04.309 --> 15:07.343
would rise from the ashes
like a phoenix.

15:08.977 --> 15:09.927
Behold...

15:10.520 --> 15:12.809
the splendor of my beginning!

15:13.255 --> 15:15.105
I rest my case, your honor.

15:19.111 --> 15:21.585
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

15:21.865 --> 15:23.707
Underlings, I wanna hear your ideas.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.633
I knew this day would come.
I have so much inside of me.

15:26.971 --> 15:30.052
My first idea is a movie
that combines action and romance.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.555
Kenneth, you go.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.548
A name...

15:33.861 --> 15:35.894
for a pocket microwave oven.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.631
That's neat.
A little microwave oven.

15:38.959 --> 15:40.980
So it's kinda like a funcooker.

15:41.887 --> 15:43.282
The Funcooker!

15:44.748 --> 15:47.444
It's snappy, fresh,
and incapable of offending.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.910
Get legal on the phone.

15:51.141 --> 15:53.617
- I owe you one.
- One hug, you mean?

15:56.498 --> 15:59.334
They're reading Mr. Jordan's apology
if you want to watch it.

16:00.169 --> 16:03.102
<i>"I regret any pain my words and actions
may have caused.</i>

16:03.227 --> 16:05.004
<i>"I apologize to my family my fans,</i>

16:05.174 --> 16:06.505
<i>"and the American public.</i>

16:06.675 --> 16:08.507
<i>"Peace and love, Tracy Jordan."</i>

16:08.676 --> 16:11.923
<i>A heartfelt apology from a comedy icon.
And we'll be right back.</i>

16:12.048 --> 16:14.382
<i>I do not apologize, America.</i>

16:14.507 --> 16:16.557
<i>I didn't even write that apology.</i>

16:16.726 --> 16:20.687
<i>I am advertiser Tracy Jordan,
and I approve this message.</i>

16:20.855 --> 16:23.451
<i>I am an advertiser.</i>

16:23.576 --> 16:26.038
<i>I am an advertiser.</i>

16:26.569 --> 16:28.082
<i>Is that 30 seconds yet?</i>

16:29.296 --> 16:30.546
Doesn't matter.

16:31.305 --> 16:32.781
We have The Funcooker.

16:35.497 --> 16:36.738
Hi, it's Liz.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.610
I should be able
to get up there in an hour.

16:40.034 --> 16:41.805
Where are you rushing off to?

16:41.930 --> 16:42.780
Work?

16:43.049 --> 16:43.899
Not me.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.212
I'm gonna have a sandwich
in my cell and take a nap.

16:47.903 --> 16:49.548
This man opens doors for me.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.192
I'm free.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.926
I'm freer than you.

16:53.803 --> 16:54.928
Freer than you.

16:59.829 --> 17:01.584
Professor Bananas is dead.

17:02.259 --> 17:05.478
Look, I know we're fighting,
but I need to borrow your car.

17:06.429 --> 17:07.479
<i>30 seconds.</i>

17:09.085 --> 17:11.612
- How are you feeling, Miss?
- Great. Alert.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.086
Is your vision steadily
narrowing down to a pinpoint

17:15.211 --> 17:17.653
- as if darkness is closing in on you?
- No, ma'am.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.645
<i>Cast is set
for robot/bear talk show.</i>

17:25.113 --> 17:25.984
I'm back.

17:26.109 --> 17:28.838
What's going on? What have they done?
Do we need to shut this down?

17:29.006 --> 17:31.341
Calm down. Everything's going
to work out just fine.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.926
The show's about to begin,
your sketch is adequate,

17:34.095 --> 17:35.605
and I've got The Funcooker.

17:35.730 --> 17:38.765
- What about the...
- <i>It's the bear and robot talk show.</i>

17:40.142 --> 17:42.892
Jenna needs to sleep,
or she's going to die!

17:44.720 --> 17:46.370
<i>Which one of you is Jenna?</i>

17:48.527 --> 17:49.627
<i>Go to sleep!</i>

17:50.176 --> 17:51.248
<i>Sleep, Jenna!</i>

17:51.373 --> 17:53.423
<i>Sleep! It's for your own good.</i>

17:53.878 --> 17:55.128
<i>Don't fight me.</i>

17:59.534 --> 18:02.037
- <i>Sleep or die!</i>
- <i>Hey, America.</i>

18:02.206 --> 18:05.082
- Come on Tracy. Please cover for them.
- <i>Check out my funcooker.</i>

18:05.251 --> 18:07.209
Did he just say funcooker?

18:09.208 --> 18:11.158
That's where I've heard that.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.319
Go to commercial!

18:19.521 --> 18:20.764
Go to commercial!

18:21.047 --> 18:22.795
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.746
My wife's throwing away
some of our old towels.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.828
Do you want them?
Cause they're out by the trashcans.

18:28.953 --> 18:30.817
Now that's got to be 30 seconds.

18:31.861 --> 18:32.711
Nine?

18:33.888 --> 18:35.487
Here comes the funcooker.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.541
I'll be with you in a minute.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.544
Could we get some diet slice
and pita chips up in here?

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
Bitenuker!

19:37.510 --> 19:38.717
9:00 A.M. Monday.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.970
Right? I'll be there with pants on.
You're the best.

19:42.332 --> 19:43.347
Hi, girlfriend.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.850
Let's go out this weekend
and talk about you.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.833
All I did was ask for a diet slice

19:48.958 --> 19:50.458
and some pita chips.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.116
Nice try.

19:53.434 --> 19:54.566
Now it's my turn.

19:58.490 --> 20:02.450
They're all terrified of you.
That'll get you a week of good behavior.

20:05.618 --> 20:06.818
My containers.

20:07.704 --> 20:09.056
My new beginning.

20:09.804 --> 20:11.674
We've both had a rough week.

20:11.799 --> 20:14.494
You went firebug, and I'm sitting
on four million...

20:14.619 --> 20:17.225
mini-microwaves that legal
won't let out of the warehouse.

20:17.350 --> 20:21.051
I suggest we both go to our
respective homes, open a bottle of wine,

20:21.445 --> 20:23.972
and heat up some ham in the shower.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.473
It works in the shower?

20:27.270 --> 20:28.384
You know what?

20:28.509 --> 20:30.602
This really is the best day ever.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.817
Here comes the funcooker!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
