00:18.800 --> 00:20.680
Hello, campers.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.000
Rise and shine!

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
It's another glorious day,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.720
and to get you in the mood,
the sun has got his hat on.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.440
MUSIC: Funeral March
by Frederic Chopin

00:39.360 --> 00:41.040
Oh!

00:39.360 --> 00:41.040
MUSIC STOPS

00:44.320 --> 00:46.920
I'm so sorry, campers.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.520
I don't know how that happened.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.320
Come on, Mavis. I know you can
squeeze me in.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.280
I can't seem to get it up.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.680
Have either of you seen Kitty?

00:59.680 --> 01:01.240
Not recently, no.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.000
She was out all night.
It's not like her.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.640
Why don't you ask Mrs...?

01:04.640 --> 01:06.560
Mrs Chummy, I was wondering...
Not now, Sandy.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.200
What in the name of all things holy?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.920
This is my new routine, this is!

01:12.920 --> 01:15.160
When all the campers are having
their breakfast,

01:15.160 --> 01:16.800
I lay hardboiled eggs for them.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.560
HE CLUCKS

01:18.560 --> 01:22.040
Congratulations on plumbing new
depths of vulgarity.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.880
Now, who is responsible
for today's prank?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.520
Not me, Mrs Chummy.
Oh, no.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.760
That music really put
the willies up me.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.000
Well, whoever it is, it has got
to stop.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.520
We've got VIPs coming from all over
the country this weekend.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.000
And the creme de la creme
of Kembleford.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.080
We cannot afford any nonsense!

01:41.080 --> 01:43.000
Who did it?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.760
Who made that monstrous thing
out there?

01:45.760 --> 01:47.040
What is it, Jock?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.400
What?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.560
No!

02:35.200 --> 02:36.680
Oh, hello, Father!

02:36.680 --> 02:38.840
Never had you down as having
green fingers.

02:38.840 --> 02:42.160
I'm looking after the garden while
Mrs McCarthy is away.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.960
And I hope that everything survives
until she gets back.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.240
Where's she gone?

02:46.240 --> 02:49.400
To Ireland. To visit her sister.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.880
And it is only in her absence
that I realise how much

02:51.880 --> 02:53.760
I rely on her.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.640
Still, everyone deserves a holiday!

02:56.640 --> 02:58.840
Very true. Oh, speaking of which...

03:00.600 --> 03:02.040
..did you get one of these?

03:04.080 --> 03:06.600
An invitation to Chummy's
Holiday Camp.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.880
I'm intrigued.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.760
Well, we're going, and the Inspector
and his family.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.920
Should be a nice relaxing weekend.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.200
Let's hope so.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.600
Cheerio, Father.
Cheerio, Sergeant.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.720
TANNOY TONES

03:20.160 --> 03:23.720
Hello, campers.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.880
Rise and shine!

03:25.880 --> 03:29.000
And what a load of frolics
we have for you today.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.480
At 11 o'clock, our ever-popular
knobbly knees competition,

03:33.480 --> 03:37.680
followed by an Egyptian cabaret.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.960
Something for everyone, whether you
like Egypt or knees.

03:43.840 --> 03:47.000
But it was 20 years ago -
my late husband,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.680
Charlie, and I built this camp.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.320
And tonight we are having a gala
celebration

03:52.320 --> 03:55.400
with stars old and new.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.040
So come along and let the memories
come flooding back.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.120
# We're all chums at Chummy's...

04:09.120 --> 04:11.000
Yes.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.040
# Loyal to the end

04:15.040 --> 04:20.160
# Come here as a stranger and
you'll go away... #

04:20.160 --> 04:21.760
Good morning, everybody.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.200
Good morning, Mrs Chummy.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.920
Now, as you know, today is
our anniversary...

04:25.920 --> 04:27.200
Oh!

04:27.200 --> 04:29.960
Sorry I'm late,
I was helping a lost child.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.600
Really? Well, it's a pity you didn't
get lost yourself,

04:32.600 --> 04:34.160
but never mind.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.400
As I was saying, today is
our anniversary.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.040
So there must be no more pranks,
or any kind of silliness.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.800
Yes, Mrs Chummy. Woof, Mrs Chummy.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.440
So Sandy will be meeting our VIPs.
If that's all right with you?

04:47.440 --> 04:48.680
Of course, Mrs Chummy.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.400
Which means that you will
be in charge

04:51.400 --> 04:52.880
of the knobbly knees competition.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.600
Oh, Mrs Chummy, please!

04:54.600 --> 04:56.440
Knobbly knees are beneath me!

04:56.440 --> 04:58.520
I am a highly-skilled entertainer.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.840
Ha! Well, your secret's safe
with me.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.000
You keep your little wet nose
out of it.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.200
Mrs Chummy, if he doesn't want to,
I'd love to have a go.

05:09.600 --> 05:15.160
"Friends, campers, countrymen -
lend me your knees!"

05:15.160 --> 05:16.400
No!

05:16.400 --> 05:18.280
Mavis, how many times?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.520
The reason Chummy's has
lasted so long

05:20.520 --> 05:22.480
is because everyone knows
their place.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.120
And your place is at the end
of this!

05:36.240 --> 05:37.560
Morning.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.160
How was your chalet, Father?

05:46.320 --> 05:49.520
Quite sufficient for one night.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.480
They don't really go in
for home comforts here.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.640
They want you out and about,
having fun.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.240
Speaking of which, I have to go
and find the Inspector.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.600
I'll see you later, Father.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.400
Father Brown?

06:04.400 --> 06:05.720
Hello.
I'm Sandy.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.080
Sandy Beauchamp.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.200
And I've come to show you
the Island of Dreams.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.960
You must be a...

06:11.960 --> 06:13.560
Orangecoat.
Oh, yes!

06:13.560 --> 06:15.360
Yes.
Of course.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.160
Is it fun?
Oh, yeah. Every day is so exciting.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.200
Some days it's quite hard
to finish my breakfast.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.680
And what would you say was the
secret of Chummy's success?

06:24.680 --> 06:26.160
Er, variety.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.640
Everywhere you go,
there's a new gay adventure.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.760
So, shall I take you to the lady
who made it all happen?

06:32.760 --> 06:36.680
TANNOY TONES

06:32.760 --> 06:36.680
Hello, campers.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.000
It's knobbly knees time!

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
So, whether your knees are bonny
or bony,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.480
bring them along to our magnificent
outdoor pool.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.320
Oh, Father Brown!

06:54.320 --> 06:57.240
Our illustrious guest.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.200
I was most surprised to be invited.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.600
Oh, I've always been very interested
in the church.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.000
The liturgy, the traditions.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.200
You are very welcome at Mass
tomorrow.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.800
I said I was interested.
I didn't say I was obsessed.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.360
But it's so nice to have you here.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.800
Allow me to give you the grand tour.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.280
Now, my husband, Charlie, was one
of the big nobs

07:23.280 --> 07:25.000
of the entertainment industry.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.160
But so many of his childhood
holidays

07:27.160 --> 07:28.800
were ruined by the rain.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.560
So, back in 1933, he dreamed of
a place

07:31.560 --> 07:35.200
where the fun flows freely
and rain never stops play.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.480
20 years on, here we are!

07:37.480 --> 07:41.000
Oh, later on, we're having a little
talent contest

07:41.000 --> 07:43.400
if you fancy giving us a turn?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.000
I know one or two songs.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.760
What about...
No, no, not now.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.320
I don't want to pre-judge.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.640
This is a very special place.
Dream Cottage.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.040
Charlie and I used to live here.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.000
I still do, and it's very much
the beating heart

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
of the operation.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.120
Mrs Chummy?
Hm?

08:02.120 --> 08:04.000
I'm intrigued.
Yes?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.080
The swimming pool is such
a feature of Chummy's,

08:06.080 --> 08:10.200
and yet, in 1938, it was a sandpit.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.760
Was it?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.600
I think we were just
conserving water.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.160
Mrs Chummy,
I don't like to interrupt.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.440
Well, then, don't.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.240
But I've just found out that Sylvia,

08:20.240 --> 08:22.000
who was due to do the
sports day today,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.920
has got a gippy tummy.
And?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.240
And I thought maybe I could
help out.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.000
I could organise the limbo dancing.
Indeed.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.400
As you're so good at bending
backwards for the guests.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.000
But you are not, and will never be,
an Orangecoat.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.520
Haven't you got any floors to mop?

08:37.520 --> 08:39.000
Yes, Mrs Chummy.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.520
Sorry, Mrs Chummy.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.000
I'm sorry. I do hope that didn't
seem too harsh.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.480
It did a bit.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.560
Well, I apologise, but here
at Chummy's,

08:50.560 --> 08:53.000
we have to run a very tight ship,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.680
which is why our trophy cabinet
is simply

08:56.680 --> 08:58.320
groaning with awards.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.240
Ah!

09:02.240 --> 09:05.520
Oh! This is someone's idea
of a joke!

09:05.520 --> 09:07.360
Mavis!

09:07.360 --> 09:09.680
Mavis!
Yes, Mrs Chummy?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.760
Will you get rid of this?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.560
Roll up! Roll up!

09:17.560 --> 09:20.400
Who wants to roll up their
trouser legs,

09:20.400 --> 09:23.280
expose their knees to the breeze?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.680
Come on, sir, it's just
a bit of fun.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.800
I fail to see the appeal
of naked kneecaps.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.000
First prize is a barrel of beer.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.640
John, hold my coat.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.960
Inspector.
Padre.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.360
Don't tell me it's a mortal sin
to expose one's kneecaps?

09:41.360 --> 09:44.240
On the contrary,
the Bible is clear,

09:44.240 --> 09:47.240
one should not hide one's light
under a bushel.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.680
Very droll.

09:48.680 --> 09:53.400
JOCK: Right, let's get them lined up
by the...tedium.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.320
Stadium.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.880
Is everything all right, mate?
No, its not.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.560
I didn't want to do this.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.560
CHILD LAUGHS

10:01.560 --> 10:04.080
And they're far too close
to the edge!

10:04.080 --> 10:06.800
Where's Mavis? She's supposed to be
supervising.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.880
Mavis? What are you talking about?

10:08.880 --> 10:10.720
Is everything tickety-boo?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.600
Jock's just having a moment.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.480
Well, you take over the competition.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.760
And, Jock, come with me.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.280
I want a word with you.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.200
Mind if I join you?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.320
It's a free country.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.840
How did you get on in the knobbly
knees contest, Inspector?

10:43.840 --> 10:45.760
Go on, sir. Don't be modest.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.320
Third prize.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.120
Mrs McCarthy may have found fame
with her scones,

10:52.120 --> 10:54.080
but I have won a prize
for my patella.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.080
APPLAUSE

11:04.240 --> 11:07.400
# We're off to Egypt

11:07.400 --> 11:10.720
# Underneath the desert sun

11:10.720 --> 11:14.000
# No place like Egypt

11:14.000 --> 11:17.120
# Far away from everyone

11:17.120 --> 11:20.560
# So we say farewell
to Chummy's

11:20.560 --> 11:24.000
# Heading for the land of mummies

11:24.000 --> 11:27.240
# We're off to Egypt

11:27.240 --> 11:29.760
# Come along and join the fun. #

11:32.920 --> 11:36.480
So, here I am.

11:36.480 --> 11:41.640
On the trail of the rootin'
Tutankhamun.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.080
KNOCKING

11:41.640 --> 11:44.080
But what's that sound?

11:44.080 --> 11:46.360
Is it my black pudding coming back
to haunt me?

11:48.520 --> 11:50.520
Look who it is!

11:50.520 --> 11:52.040
It's...

11:54.080 --> 11:56.440
Well, I'm sorry, ladies and
gentlemen.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.680
I...

11:58.720 --> 12:00.520
Sorry.
Look who it is!

12:00.520 --> 12:02.880
It's Uncle Jock!

12:02.880 --> 12:04.440
But he's not going to help.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.040
He's all wrapped up.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.520
MUSIC PLAYS

12:48.320 --> 12:49.680
Whoa!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.800
TANNOY TONES

12:53.800 --> 12:56.000
Well, wasn't that fun, everybody?

12:56.000 --> 13:00.320
But yummy, yummy, yummy -
there's a rumbling in my tummy!

13:00.320 --> 13:03.680
Thank goodness it's time for...
SHE SCREAMS

13:03.680 --> 13:06.120
SHE CHOKES

13:06.120 --> 13:09.040
Kembleford police!
Everyone stay right where you are!

13:14.000 --> 13:16.680
KNOCKING
Mrs Chummy, are you all right?

13:18.120 --> 13:19.440
Mrs Chummy?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.360
Mrs Chummy? Move out the way,
please.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.520
Oh! Oh, Mrs Chummy!

13:32.520 --> 13:34.840
Just take some deep breaths.
You'll be all right.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.600
Oh!

13:36.600 --> 13:39.000
There must be a homicidal
maniac about!

13:39.000 --> 13:41.200
Perhaps we should turn off
the microphone?

13:45.680 --> 13:51.000
Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine,
et lux perpetua luceat ei.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.520
Offerentes eam in conspectu
Altissimi.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.600
Amen.
Finally.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.040
You can go now, Padre.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.120
She's been strangled.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.880
I'm well aware of that, thank you.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.240
And on the 20th anniversary
of her husband's creation.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.720
And you think the date
is significant?

14:10.720 --> 14:14.360
Indeed I do. Earlier today,
I saw a clown statue

14:14.360 --> 14:16.600
dressed as the Grim Reaper.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.000
It now looks as if it was
a prophecy.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.200
Oh, Lord. Oh, blessed David and all
the saints.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.000
I don't think I'll be able
to sleep tonight.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.680
They'll put us under
police protection.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.200
If there is someone out there.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.760
Oh, it's you.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.720
Now, I have to ask,
are you the real thing,

14:33.720 --> 14:35.560
or is this fancy dress?

14:35.560 --> 14:36.880
The real thing.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.600
At least, I try my best.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.200
Any sign of the Inspector?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.120
He's talking to Jock,

14:44.120 --> 14:46.200
who'll be telling him
theatrical anecdotes.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.000
Oh, he'll be gone till doomsday.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I understand Mr McCudgeon was here
from the very beginning?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.680
Yeah, that's right. And he's always
saying he's going to be here

14:54.680 --> 14:57.440
till Old Father Time brings down
the curtain.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.160
Well, that won't be possible now,
will it?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.000
Chummy's will have to close.
No!

15:03.000 --> 15:04.480
We can't close!

15:04.480 --> 15:06.400
We're booked solid till the end
of the season.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
We've got the big show tonight!

15:08.400 --> 15:09.800
The show must go on?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.360
I-I think so. There are people
coming

15:11.360 --> 15:12.720
from all over the country.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.440
Sergeant...?
Not now, Father.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.120
Someone seems in a bit of a hurry.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.760
Hello, everyone.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.840
Tea? Coffee? Ovaltine?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.280
Mavis, what are you doing here?

15:27.280 --> 15:28.680
What do you mean?

15:28.680 --> 15:30.800
The police told us to sit and wait
to be interviewed.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.000
Yeah, but they've done me.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.840
So I thought I'd give out
some refreshments.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.560
Is that wise?
What?

15:37.160 --> 15:39.880
You're not suggesting that I'm
trying to poison people?

15:39.880 --> 15:41.160
No, I never said that.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.640
They spoke to me first!

15:42.640 --> 15:45.520
They let me go.
They know I'm innocent.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.320
Mavis Jug?
Yes?

15:47.320 --> 15:49.280
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder

15:49.280 --> 15:51.160
of Mrs Marjorie Chummy.
No!

15:51.160 --> 15:52.680
You're not obliged to say anything,

15:52.680 --> 15:54.640
but anything you do say may be given
in evidence.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.920
This is madness. I'm innocent.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.560
I'll charge Miss Jug back at
the station.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.400
You stay and secure
the crime scene.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.640
I'm taken aback, Sergeant.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.320
That was a brutal strangulation,

16:09.320 --> 16:11.640
and Mavis seems like
a gentle soul.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.680
We've just been searching
her lodgings,

16:13.680 --> 16:15.920
found the murder weapon, Father.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.480
How did she have time to go back
to her lodgings?

16:18.480 --> 16:22.240
Well, she was the only one in the
area when the crime took place.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.520
Why be so foolish?

16:24.520 --> 16:27.800
Why choose a time when everyone else
has a perfect alibi?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.040
Unless that was the idea?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.120
TAPPING

16:46.120 --> 16:50.560
So, Mrs Chummy's death was
broadcast,

16:50.560 --> 16:52.760
but how do we know it was live?

16:52.760 --> 16:55.880
Er, because we heard it.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.640
"Yummy, yummy, yummy -
there's a rumbling in my tummy!"

16:58.640 --> 17:01.600
She must have said that every day.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.000
What if the killer recorded it
on another day,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.720
and then added the sounds
of strangulation?

17:07.720 --> 17:11.000
They'd still need to be here
to turn it on, Father.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.800
If the recording was at
the end of the reel,

17:13.800 --> 17:16.240
the killer could've murdered
Mrs Chummy, pressed play...

17:17.800 --> 17:20.760
..and the announcement wouldn't have
gone out till 12:45.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.000
But there's no tape in the machine.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.440
Because it's been removed.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.520
Presumably while we were preoccupied
with the corpse.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.080
How the devil did they do that?

17:41.800 --> 17:44.120
And how is the Inspector's
health and temper?

17:44.120 --> 17:46.000
At the moment, I don't think you'd
mistake him

17:46.000 --> 17:47.240
for a ray of sunshine.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.840
Oh, dear.
Hm.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.560
He says there was only one person
in the area.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.360
Mavis. One person with no alibi.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.720
Mavis.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.480
And that Mrs Chummy was strangled
with an apron belonging to...

17:59.480 --> 18:00.840
..Mavis.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.680
Although it is an unusual killer
that takes the murder weapon

18:03.680 --> 18:05.200
home with them.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.240
He claims she wasn't in her right
state of mind.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.640
For years, she's been begging to
become an Orangecoat.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.400
But Mrs Chummy would only ever use
her as a maid.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.400
I suspect the sheer frustration
caused her to snap.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.400
I see.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.560
Yes, I imagine that is a nightmare
of the Inspector's -

18:23.560 --> 18:26.680
the downtrodden workers overthrowing
their tyrannical bosses.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.920
You've got to admit, though, Father,

18:29.920 --> 18:32.920
until we find the tape that
the killer used,

18:32.920 --> 18:35.000
we've not really got much to go on.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.160
I've got a horrible feeling
the Inspector may get

18:37.160 --> 18:38.520
his way with this one.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.080
Although, we do have an advantage
over the Inspector.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.600
And what's that?
Our ability to listen.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.960
I didn't do it.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.400
I didn't like Mrs Chummy,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.440
but why would I want to
throttle her?

18:52.240 --> 18:55.040
Do you know anyone who might have
wanted to harm her?

18:58.360 --> 19:01.000
We both saw that Grim Reaper
earlier.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
We've had all sorts of pranks.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.400
Funny noises over the tannoy,

19:05.400 --> 19:08.680
a dummy of Mrs Chummy with a knife
sticking out of it.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.280
How long has this been going on?

19:10.280 --> 19:12.560
Oh, about two weeks.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.360
Is there anybody who might have
born a grudge against her?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.000
I can think of one.

19:23.480 --> 19:27.320
For the past few weeks, Sandy's been
looking after a stray cat,

19:27.320 --> 19:28.840
Kitty.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.560
But then it went missing.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.000
Darling, I told you before,
pets are not permitted.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.720
I gave you an ultimatum
to get rid of it.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.760
How could I do that?
I don't know.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.000
Down a well, possibly.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.440
Anyway, you won't need to worry
about it now.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.840
Do you know where she is?

19:45.840 --> 19:48.160
As I say, you won't need to worry.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.920
If you've hurt a single hair on
that animal's head, I'll...

19:50.920 --> 19:53.040
CLATTERING

19:54.680 --> 19:56.080
What happened?

19:56.080 --> 19:59.520
I dropped my bucket and Mrs Chummy
told me to sling my hook, so...

20:03.000 --> 20:04.640
Why frame you for the murder?

20:06.360 --> 20:10.560
Is there any reason why someone
might bear you ill will?

20:10.560 --> 20:11.920
I don't think so.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.640
I just do my best to keep
my head down,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.040
keep going.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.400
Am I going to hang for this,
Father?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.640
I will do all I can to prevent it.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.840
So, how is she, Father?

20:36.840 --> 20:38.720
Not good.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.840
I think she has survived her whole
life on hope -

20:41.840 --> 20:43.640
and reserves are running dry.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.720
I need to get back to the camp.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.400
Well, I've got the day off
and a full tank of petrol.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.800
Good.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.560
Let's go and see a man about a cat.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.800
Please. Take a seat.

21:04.800 --> 21:09.000
Oh, this is very...

21:09.000 --> 21:10.400
Small.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.040
I was going to say cosy.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.120
Were you fond of Mrs Chummy?

21:16.120 --> 21:18.240
Yeah, I thought she was amazing.

21:18.240 --> 21:22.160
It takes a special type of person to
create their own magical world.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.240
Someone who is utterly driven,

21:24.240 --> 21:26.560
and will stop at nothing
to get what they want?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.040
I don't know what do you mean.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.560
Well...

21:30.560 --> 21:34.560
..you were overheard having an
argument with Mrs Chummy,

21:34.560 --> 21:36.800
about something that had been
taken away.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.640
Oh, no. It's not like that.
I...

21:40.800 --> 21:42.520
Are you all right?

21:42.520 --> 21:44.480
I just...

21:44.480 --> 21:46.800
I think I'm going to...

21:46.800 --> 21:48.320
HE SNEEZES

21:48.320 --> 21:50.000
Bless you.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.480
A very violent sneeze, Sergeant.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.200
I'm sorry, Father.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.120
I couldn't help myself.

21:56.120 --> 22:00.280
Are you perhaps allergic to
certain animals?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.080
Oh, sorry. I forgot to mention.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.920
Here, Kitty.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.520
Kitty. Aw!

22:08.800 --> 22:12.000
Kitty came to live with me and
Mrs Chummy found out

22:12.000 --> 22:13.720
and confiscated it to teach me
a lesson.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.120
But I just said, "If you've done
anything to hurt my cat,

22:16.120 --> 22:17.480
"I shall resign."

22:17.480 --> 22:18.840
What did she say to that?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.480
She said, "Just keep it out
of my sight

22:20.480 --> 22:22.200
"and don't get any hairs
on your uniform."

22:22.200 --> 22:23.680
THEY CHUCKLE

22:22.200 --> 22:23.680
So...

22:23.680 --> 22:26.200
If you stood up to Mrs Chummy,
then she respected you.

22:26.200 --> 22:31.160
It's only if you were a bit weak,
she tended to bully you.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.880
Who in particular did she bully?

22:36.760 --> 22:40.000
W... You know, if I had
to say someone,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.600
it'd be Jock.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.720
He does his best, but he does get
in a bit of a muddle.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.400
And, yeah, she really used
to pick on him.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.200
You don't really think it could
be Jock, do you, Father?

22:52.200 --> 22:55.240
I mean, he seems like he's in
a world all of his own.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.800
Unless it's all an act.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.480
And that's the way to do it!

22:58.480 --> 23:00.480
That's the way to do it!

23:00.480 --> 23:01.840
Mr McCudgeon?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.280
What is it?

23:05.800 --> 23:08.000
Sorry.
May we have a word?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.360
Oh, yes.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.840
Father...Green, was it?

23:20.840 --> 23:22.480
Near enough.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.000
Wanted to have a word with you
about Mrs Chummy -

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
as you'd known her longer
than anyone else.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.720
Oh, for more years than I care
to remember.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.000
I was in variety with her husband.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
When they opened the camp,
I was only too happy

23:36.000 --> 23:37.520
to come and help out.
Mm.

23:37.520 --> 23:41.640
Although, you didn't look too happy
at the knobbly knees competition.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.680
Yes, well, I was concerned about
some safety issues.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.360
Mrs Chummy asked to have a word
with you.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.760
Afterwards, you were very
distressed.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.160
You were late on stage
for the cabaret.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.640
Well, I was distressed.

23:55.640 --> 24:00.960
Sometimes, Mrs Chummy over-reacts
a little.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.520
And what do you think you
were doing?

24:04.520 --> 24:08.000
I was concerned the podium was too
close to the pool.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.240
I did not want an accident.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.640
Oh, there's an accident every time
you step on the stage.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.640
It's the biggest day of my life,
and you've spoiled it!

24:15.640 --> 24:18.720
No, that is most unfair.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.000
I've worked hard for you
all these years.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.240
And now you're a liability.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.000
When tonight's festivities are over,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.480
I want you out!

24:27.680 --> 24:29.520
Oh, how pretty! Look!

24:29.520 --> 24:30.960
Oh, what fun!

24:32.640 --> 24:34.080
Yes.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.560
That does sound like
an over-reaction.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.000
She was just a bit anxious
about this morning.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.320
She would have changed her mind
by this evening.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.640
Anxious about what in particular?

24:43.640 --> 24:45.760
Well, the pranks.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.640
The anniversary.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.880
Seeing old faces.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.480
And old memories.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.080
What sort of memories?

24:59.200 --> 25:01.720
Ah, the children! My audience!

25:01.720 --> 25:04.720
It's time for my 12 o'clock
performance!

25:04.720 --> 25:06.160
12 o'clock?

25:06.160 --> 25:07.520
It's 3:30!

25:08.520 --> 25:11.720
So, could he have killed her
in order to keep his job?

25:12.960 --> 25:14.520
Or to keep a secret.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.120
That's the way to do it!

25:19.120 --> 25:21.240
That's the way to do it!

25:21.240 --> 25:22.720
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

25:24.800 --> 25:27.000
Where are we going, Father?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Dream Cottage.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.120
Mrs Chummy's house.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.560
The headquarters of the operation.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.720
You know, I've always wondered
how you gain access

25:39.720 --> 25:41.880
to so many crime scenes.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.200
Have you?

25:44.440 --> 25:47.240
Ah, well, perhaps you should
look away now.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.240
This is very nice.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.480
I'm clearly in the wrong job.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.960
So, what are you looking for,
Father?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.440
The story of Chummy's.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.080
RATTLING

26:10.560 --> 26:13.760
Or rather, the story that
Mrs Chummy...

26:15.320 --> 26:17.040
..doesn't want told.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.280
Photograph album.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.160
It's their honeymoon.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.760
In Nice.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.640
Strange thing to keep in
a locked drawer.

26:35.640 --> 26:36.840
Indeed.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.840
Employment records.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.840
Jock McCudgeon.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.200
20 years.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.160
No complaints.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.600
And yet, Mrs Chummy seemed very keen
to let him go.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.560
This is a letter from a
theatre manager,

26:56.560 --> 26:58.000
Mr Parnell,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.400
asking about the availability
of Griff Grimshaw

27:00.400 --> 27:02.800
to appear at the London Palladium.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.480
A very prestigious venue.

27:04.480 --> 27:08.160
And this is a follow-up letter,
written a few days later.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.240
"Dear Mrs Chummy,

27:10.240 --> 27:12.880
"thank you for warning me about
Mr Grimshaw.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.000
"No, we cannot afford to have
a drunken layabout

27:15.000 --> 27:16.520
"in our company.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.360
"I have cancelled his contract
forthwith."

27:19.360 --> 27:20.680
When was that dated?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.040
Just over two weeks ago.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.720
Mr Grimshaw?

27:27.720 --> 27:29.440
There's no sign of him, Father.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.480
Whoa!

27:31.480 --> 27:33.560
Hi-ho, Silver!

27:33.560 --> 27:35.360
Mr Grimshaw?

27:35.360 --> 27:36.640
May we have a word?

27:36.640 --> 27:37.880
Well, I'll do my best.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.640
But it's quite hard to control
this thing.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.680
I wanted to talk to you about
Mrs Chummy.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.560
Ah, yes.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.520
I can't believe she's dead.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.600
I never knew anyone so alive.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.880
Will you stop that?!

27:51.120 --> 27:53.440
You do know I could have you
arrested for common assault?

27:53.440 --> 27:54.800
Me or the ostrich?

27:54.800 --> 27:57.400
I gather she wasn't the most
encouraging of employers.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.680
Oh, no.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.640
She was always encouraging us
to try hard,

28:01.640 --> 28:03.040
do our best for the place.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.360
Mr Grimshaw, for entertainers
like you,

28:05.360 --> 28:08.880
Chummy is the first rung on
the ladder to success.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.040
Unless Mrs Chummy snatched
the ladder away.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.560
What are you talking about?

28:13.560 --> 28:16.000
A six-week show at the
London Palladium,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.080
which would have starred a comedian
called Griff Grimshaw.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.040
Only, Mrs Chummy said he wasn't
suitable.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.200
She did a bit more than that,
you know!

28:24.200 --> 28:25.600
She wrote to them.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.000
She told them what a useless
drunk I was.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.880
Well, not so useless that I couldn't
phone the secretary

28:30.880 --> 28:32.280
and find out what was going on!

28:32.280 --> 28:33.800
That must have made you very angry.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.840
Well, I didn't exactly jump
for joy.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.520
And how did your anger express
itself, Mr Grimshaw?

28:40.520 --> 28:43.880
I played one or two practical jokes.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.680
Nothing serious.
I swapped a few records around.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.000
Didn't you make a dummy with a knife
sticking into it?

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
OK, well, I thought it seemed quite
amusing at the time,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.440
but I didn't, you know...

28:54.440 --> 28:56.840
So, who did?
Well, how should I know?

28:56.840 --> 28:58.920
She was always picking on people.

28:58.920 --> 29:02.000
Jock, and poor old Mavis.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.480
She took away her dream job.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.080
She told her, "You'll never be
an Orangecoat again."

29:07.080 --> 29:08.520
Again?

29:10.520 --> 29:12.440
Well, it was a long time ago.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.520
When Mr McCudgeon became confused,

29:17.520 --> 29:20.520
he still imagined you were
an Orangecoat.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.120
He was calling for you, wondering
why you weren't on duty.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.040
We were by the pool.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.000
And earlier, in the exhibition,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.120
I noticed that the pool had been
filled in for some years.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.280
Why?

29:39.680 --> 29:41.560
I try not to think about it.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.640
There was a little boy

29:46.640 --> 29:49.800
and he got separated from
his parents,

29:49.800 --> 29:51.360
and he went to the pool.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.680
It was being cleaned at the time,
but he...

29:56.760 --> 29:59.880
He couldn't read the sign saying
keep out.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.240
So he went in.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.240
And he couldn't swim.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.320
No-one saw him till it was too late.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.520
What was your role in all this,
Mavis?

30:14.520 --> 30:17.000
I was in charge of first aid.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.040
I knew how to give the kiss of life.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.960
Only, I'd...

30:23.000 --> 30:25.240
I'd just met a very nice man...

30:26.280 --> 30:28.360
..and he'd asked me back
to his chalet.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.200
I was only gone an hour.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.120
But I was too late.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.360
Was there a cover-up?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.320
They did everything to keep
the place open,

31:04.320 --> 31:05.880
keep it out of the papers.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.240
They?

31:07.240 --> 31:08.840
Mrs Chummy and Uncle Jock.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.000
Ah, hello!
Father Brown?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.840
You know we're having a
talent show later?

31:16.840 --> 31:20.000
Oh! Er, maybe you should rest
your vocal cords

31:20.000 --> 31:21.840
for Mass tomorrow, Father.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.200
Of course.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.360
I wonder where I might find
Mr McCudgeon?

31:25.360 --> 31:27.680
Oh, he's just getting changed.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.880
Er, can I leave Mr McCudgeon to you,
Father?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.840
I need to find the Inspector
and Mrs Goodfellow.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.000
We're watching the big
show together.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I'll see you there.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.480
Mr McCudgeon?

31:40.800 --> 31:43.120
KNOCKING

31:40.800 --> 31:43.120
Hello!

31:44.720 --> 31:47.120
Mr McCudgeon?

31:47.120 --> 31:48.760
How do you do?

31:48.760 --> 31:51.440
Will you be disappearing?

31:51.440 --> 31:54.400
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a new trick.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.040
I shall be performing it tonight
with young Griff.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.000
The show about Chummy memories.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.880
Not all of them happy.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.720
The boy who drowned in
the swimming pool.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.040
Why do you bring that up?

32:20.520 --> 32:23.200
Because everything that has
happened today

32:23.200 --> 32:25.000
is connected to that tragedy.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.440
Do you remember his name?

32:31.360 --> 32:33.720
It was...Jimmy?

32:34.800 --> 32:36.320
Timmy?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.840
No, sorry, it's gone.

32:40.840 --> 32:46.480
But I remember his face and
the terrible feeling

32:46.480 --> 32:48.040
I could do nothing for him.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.600
Where were you when it happened?

32:52.840 --> 32:54.160
At the other end of the camp.

32:54.160 --> 32:57.760
I heard the screams, I came running,
and there was Mrs Chummy,

32:57.760 --> 33:02.360
screaming for Mavis instead of doing
something to help the child.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.400
Poor boy was floating.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.960
I pulled him from the water,
but...

33:14.720 --> 33:16.000
..it was too late.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.560
There must have been
a coroner's inquest?

33:23.160 --> 33:26.000
I told them Mavis had nothing
to do with it.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.760
She was detained looking after
another child.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.160
Then they asked me about
Mrs Chummy

33:33.160 --> 33:37.040
and why she hadn't dived in
and saved him.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.040
I presume you told them
she couldn't swim?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.480
How do you know?

33:48.480 --> 33:53.280
Photographs, secreted in
Mrs Chummy's house,

33:53.280 --> 33:55.440
of her honeymoon.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.280
Swimming in the sea at Nice.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.720
If they had become public,

34:00.720 --> 34:04.240
Mrs Chummy would have been charged
with negligence

34:04.240 --> 34:07.440
and you would have spent time
in prison for perjury.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.880
I'm not proud of what I did.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.440
I only did it to keep this
place going.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.680
Billy!

34:20.000 --> 34:21.480
That was his name.

APPLAUSE

34:39.840 --> 34:41.760
Hello, everybody.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.200
It's so sweet to see
so many old faces.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.000
But tonight's show is all about
the lady

34:49.000 --> 34:50.400
who made this place happen.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.680
Dear Mrs Chummy...

Mr Beauchamp, may I have a word?

Er, yeah.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.680
How did you make those
flowers appear?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.800
A magician never tells.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.000
No, of course.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.840
In the radio studio,

37:10.840 --> 37:13.200
after Mrs Chummy's death,

37:13.200 --> 37:16.080
someone made a tape disappear.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.640
And watching you tonight,
I think I know who.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.680
No.
Oh, Mrs Chummy. I...

37:28.680 --> 37:30.920
Just take some deep breaths.
You'll be all right.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.720
There must be a homicidal
maniac about!

37:34.720 --> 37:38.280
You used Mavis' consternation
as a distraction

37:38.280 --> 37:40.360
to take away a vital piece
of evidence.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.000
I don't know what you're
talking about.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.320
And all for a boy named
Billy Fairfield.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.040
I presume he was your brother?

37:52.920 --> 37:57.520
You see, if you translate Fairfield
into French,

37:57.520 --> 37:59.040
it becomes Beauchamp.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.000
And you must have needed
a new name

38:02.000 --> 38:03.440
to come and work here.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.600
Tell me, what's your real name?

38:07.600 --> 38:09.240
Andrew.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.720
Andrew Fairfield.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.200
Tell me about your brother, Andrew.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.000
Billy was kind.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.240
And he was funny.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.480
And people used to say
he was simple.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.880
Slow learning. But I loved him
more than anyone.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.240
We came here as a family,
and I'd never seen him so happy.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.840
But then he wandered off.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.240
And everyone said, "Don't worry,

38:38.240 --> 38:40.240
"this is the safest place
in the world."

38:41.760 --> 38:45.320
I cannot imagine the pain you
and your parents suffered.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.000
They never got over it.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.320
They died last year.
50 years old.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.040
They looked 100.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.640
So now it was up to you to find out
the truth.

38:57.640 --> 39:01.120
I came here to work. But I only
wanted one thing.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.360
I-I wanted to ask you something.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.760
Oh, yes?

39:08.760 --> 39:12.560
Is it true, er, a boy once drowned
in the swimming pool?

39:13.720 --> 39:18.280
Oh, dear. Who's been putting poison
in your delicate little ears?

39:18.280 --> 39:19.760
One of the visitors.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.840
Well, it was a long time ago.

39:22.840 --> 39:26.720
H-How could it happen with so many
people on duty?

39:26.720 --> 39:28.800
Well, Mavis should have been there,

39:28.800 --> 39:32.080
but she'd just met a carpet salesman
from Droitwich.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.040
And I'd had a long day.

39:35.080 --> 39:39.000
But the thing is, he was abnormal.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.720
Mentally defective.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.200
It was a blessing in disguise
for the poor family.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.120
I know she didn't kill him.
But she didn't care.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.400
And that's enough.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.000
So now you had two people to blame.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.240
Oh, cooey!

39:51.000 --> 39:53.240
SHE GIGGLES

39:57.440 --> 40:00.000
You took Mavis' apron

40:00.000 --> 40:02.440
and went to the radio studio
and prepared to kill

40:02.440 --> 40:05.440
two birds with one stone.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.440
SHE CHOKES

40:13.280 --> 40:15.520
And now you want me to tell
the police?

40:15.520 --> 40:18.000
To save Mavis' life?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.120
I want you to save your own soul.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.760
You love your brother,

40:23.760 --> 40:26.000
and if you want to be with him
in heaven...

40:27.280 --> 40:28.920
..you need to do the right thing.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.320
You need to give up all thoughts
of revenge.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.520
No.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.320
I made Billy a promise -

40:37.320 --> 40:41.400
to punish anyone who failed him or
who lied about what happened.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.960
Right, then!

40:42.960 --> 40:47.400
Now we place Uncle Jock into the
cabinet of death!

40:47.400 --> 40:49.000
Are you all right in there,
Uncle Jock?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.600
I think so!

40:50.600 --> 40:53.120
Get on with it?
It's a very tight squeeze.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.600
Stop!

41:01.640 --> 41:03.440
I think you should put down
that sword.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.320
HE WHISPERS: It's OK, Father.
This thing's retractable.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.840
Right, then. Here it goes.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.920
Straight through the heart.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.640
THEY GASP

41:18.280 --> 41:20.000
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.560
It's not the first time
I've died on stage.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.240
Help! Get me out of here!

41:23.240 --> 41:25.800
Can anyone tell me what's going on?

41:26.760 --> 41:28.320
This young man can.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.040
And I would ask you to listen
to him without prejudice.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.000
BELLS CHIME

41:37.200 --> 41:38.520
Well, well.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.520
The garden's looking rather
splendid, Father.

41:41.520 --> 41:45.000
Well, I think on balance there's
more alive than dead.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.720
But I'll be glad when
Mrs McCarthy returns.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.160
Ah, look who it is!

41:49.160 --> 41:51.040
Sergeant. Father Brown.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.680
Mavis Jug. How nice to see you.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.800
Oh, it's nice just to be out
in the daylight.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.960
I thought I was going to be stuck
in that cell forever.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.000
And yet, here you are.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.240
And I notice...

42:02.240 --> 42:03.720
I know!

42:03.720 --> 42:05.440
It's like a dream come true.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.680
Congratulations.

42:06.680 --> 42:07.920
Hey, how did you manage it?

42:07.920 --> 42:10.040
Well, you know Mrs Chummy didn't
have any children?

42:10.040 --> 42:13.800
It turns out she's left the holiday
camp to her entire staff.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.400
So Griff is going to take over
as head entertainer.

42:17.400 --> 42:21.000
And, oh, Jock is going to carry on
living with us.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
But I don't think he's up
to performing any more.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
But we'll look after him.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.280
That's very kind.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.480
And I wish you all the best in your
endeavours.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.760
Thank you.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.000
Oh! And we've got a talent show
next week,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.560
so if either of you want to
give us a turn.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.520
Well, I do know one or two
musical songs.

42:40.520 --> 42:41.840
Well, go on, then.

42:46.400 --> 42:51.720
# List to me, while I tell you, of
the Spaniard that blighted my life

42:51.720 --> 42:53.160
# Fa-la-la

42:53.160 --> 42:59.400
# List to me, while I tell you, of
the man who stole my future wife

42:59.400 --> 43:02.600
# 'Twas at the bullfight that
we met him

43:02.600 --> 43:05.880
# We were watching his
daring display

43:05.880 --> 43:09.640
# While I just nipped outside
for some nuts and a programme

43:09.640 --> 43:12.520
# The dirty dog stole her away

43:12.520 --> 43:14.000
# He will die

43:14.000 --> 43:15.640
# He will die

43:15.640 --> 43:19.120
# He will die-diddly-die-die-die

43:19.120 --> 43:20.440
# He shall die

43:20.440 --> 43:23.360
# He shall die

43:23.360 --> 43:26.680
# I'll raise a bunion on
his Spanish onion

43:26.680 --> 43:29.800
# When I catch him
bending tonight! #

43:29.800 --> 43:32.120
APPLAUSE
