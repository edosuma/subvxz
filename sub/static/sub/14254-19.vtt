WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.435
Though it was
a blatant violation

00:03.503 --> 00:04.527
of the Prime Directive,

00:04.637 --> 00:06.605
Kirk saved the Pelosians
from extinction,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.106
just as he had the Baezians

00:08.173 --> 00:09.937
and the Chenari,
many years earlier.

00:10.010 --> 00:14.379
Finally, in the year 2270,

00:14.447 --> 00:17.348
Kirk completed
his historic five-year mission,

00:17.417 --> 00:20.477
and one of the greatest chapters
in Starfleet history

00:20.553 --> 00:21.611
came to a close.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.122
A new chapter began

00:24.190 --> 00:26.454
when Kirk regained command
of the Enterprise.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.653
How many more chapters
are there?

00:28.728 --> 00:30.286
Thirty-four.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.890
This was supposed to be
a 20-minute presentation.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.197
l was trying to be thorough.

00:36.302 --> 00:38.429
l-l could shorten the report.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.005
That won't be necessary.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.870
You obviously know
the subject matter.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.569
Congratulations, Cadet.

00:44.644 --> 00:48.011
You have just passed
Early Starfleet History.

00:48.081 --> 00:49.309
Thank you, Captain.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

00:58.892 --> 01:01.452
l would've failed him.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.723
Kirk may have been
a lowly human,

01:03.797 --> 01:05.424
but at least he had pizzazz.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.295
That report made him sound
about as exciting

01:07.367 --> 01:09.335
as a Vulcan funeral dirge.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.892
Janeway to Security.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.631
Don't bother.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.900
l trapped your crew
in a temporal loop.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.270
They keep experiencing

01:16.342 --> 01:18.401
the last 30 seconds
over and over.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.776
Almost as monotonous
as drone boy's essay.

01:20.847 --> 01:21.905
Who are you?

01:21.981 --> 01:25.747
l know he's grown
since you last saw him, Kathy,

01:25.819 --> 01:29.277
but don't tell me you can't see
the family resemblance.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.585
This is my son...

01:31.658 --> 01:33.626
Q.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.335
l'm a little hurt you
didn't recognize Junior.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.397
You are his godmother,
after all.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.305
The last time l saw
him, he was an infant.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.900
Four years ago in human time.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.512
You called me ''adorable.''

03:33.580 --> 03:35.070
You remember?

03:35.148 --> 03:36.274
l may have looked
like an infant,

03:36.349 --> 03:37.577
but l was still a Q.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.811
Maybe you should've picked
a better godparent.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.444
l wonder if it's too late
to ask Jean-Luc.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.453
What do you want, Q?

03:42.522 --> 03:44.956
Oh, Junior's taking
a little vacation

03:45.058 --> 03:45.956
from the Continuum.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.356
l recommended
he spend it with you.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.359
Why?

03:48.428 --> 03:51.056
Oh, he's always been fascinated

03:51.130 --> 03:53.189
by the old man's stories
about humanity.

03:53.266 --> 03:56.099
l thought it was time he has
some firsthand experience.

03:56.202 --> 03:58.670
l am flattered
that you would entrust me

03:58.738 --> 04:01.172
with your firstborn,
but l really don't have time.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.970
He's as quiet as a Z yznian
church mouse.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.635
You'll forget he's even here.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.712
Well, if you're going to stay,

04:10.783 --> 04:13.843
we'll need to lay down
a few ground rules.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.757
l make my own rules.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.361
l'm not detecting either Q.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.058
l want to be alerted
if they resurface.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.862
Keep running scans.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.663
Scan, scan, scan.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.431
That's all you people ever do.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.802
l've been through every deck
on this ship,

04:34.874 --> 04:36.603
and do you know what l've seen?

04:36.676 --> 04:39.236
Bipeds pushing buttons,

04:39.312 --> 04:41.780
bipeds replacing relays,

04:41.848 --> 04:43.782
bipeds running diagnostics.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.943
When are you going to do
something interesting?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.544
Say hello to Q, everyone.

04:50.189 --> 04:55.491
We could fly into fluidic space
and fight species 8472...

04:55.561 --> 04:58.086
or we could detonate
a few Omega molecules.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.291
What do you say?

05:00.366 --> 05:01.958
No.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.829
20 minutes observing humanity.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.302
l'm already bored.

05:06.372 --> 05:09.307
l guess l'm just going
to have to amuse myself.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.705
Torres to the Captain.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.541
l need you in Engineering.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.092
Once dance, B'Elanna!

05:31.164 --> 05:33.257
That's all l ask-- one dance.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.873
lf he doesn't stop
his little light show,

05:45.945 --> 05:47.412
the warp core's going to breach.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.947
Relax. lt's a party.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.709
This party is over.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.479
Get your... guests off my ship.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.282
l like you, Aunt Kathy.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.085
You've got gumption,
but what you don't have

05:58.157 --> 06:00.990
is unlimited control
of space, matter and time,

06:01.060 --> 06:03.756
which means l give
the orders around here.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.564
l could assemble a security team

06:08.668 --> 06:11.136
and attempt to take
Engineering by force.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.829
We all know
that wouldn't do any good.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.497
Besides, l'll bet that's exactly

06:14.607 --> 06:16.837
the kind of reaction
he's hoping for.

06:16.909 --> 06:20.436
He's doing everything he can
to get under our skin.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.378
lf we deny him the satisfaction
of a response,

06:22.448 --> 06:26.441
he may become bored
and return to the Continuum.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.488
Talk about perfection.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.890
lf you're attempting
to embarrass me,

06:34.961 --> 06:36.292
you won't succeed.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.057
l'm just observing humanity.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.202
Aren't you going
to scamper away,

06:45.271 --> 06:47.762
make some futile attempt
to cover yourself?

07:04.690 --> 07:06.157
Coffee, black.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.125
Make it yourself.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.662
You can thank Q's son.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.824
He thought the computer
needed more personality.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.265
Charming.

07:16.736 --> 07:21.605
l've been giving some thought
to the Q situation.

07:21.674 --> 07:25.474
Maybe ignoring him
isn't the best solution.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.843
l'm open to suggestions.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.542
He may be omnipotent,

07:31.617 --> 07:34.313
but he's still a young man
in need of guidance.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.720
Perhaps if someone were
to approach him as a friend.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.189
You think he needs a mentor.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.190
Exactly.

07:40.259 --> 07:41.692
Are you volunteering?

07:41.761 --> 07:44.525
Well, l am good with children.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.998
Q is no ordinary child.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.661
l'm no ordinary mentor.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.069
Can l help you, Kitchen Rat?

08:00.146 --> 08:03.047
l thought you and l could
spend some time together.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.481
Ha! Excellent maneuver.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.813
What are you watching?

08:06.953 --> 08:08.580
What's it look like?

08:08.654 --> 08:11.316
lt's a battle between
the Vojeans and the Wyngari.

08:11.390 --> 08:15.019
We passed through that region
a few months ago.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.819
They were at peace.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.831
Not anymore.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.197
Watch this.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.061
You have to stop this.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.698
lt's not like
there's anything else to do.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.800
We could play Kadis-Kot.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.741
Are there explosions
in Kadis-Kot?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.440
Well, no...

08:35.515 --> 08:36.447
Well, then l'm not interested.

08:42.922 --> 08:47.018
lnstead of hurting people,
maybe you could help them.

08:47.093 --> 08:51.154
The Wyngari are suffering
a food shortage on their world.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.858
Maybe you could use
your powers to...

08:53.933 --> 08:55.696
You know what, Talaxian?

08:55.801 --> 08:58.292
You talk too much.

08:58.404 --> 09:03.432
His jaw's been fused
and his vocal cords removed.

09:03.509 --> 09:06.137
l might be able to undo some
of the cosmetic damage,

09:06.212 --> 09:09.477
but only Q can restore
his voice.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.813
Janeway to the Bridge.
Report.

09:11.918 --> 09:16.287
l've got a surprise for you,
Captain. Come see.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.916
Q said l should pay attention

09:19.992 --> 09:22.756
to how you humans
act under pressure.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.428
ls this enough pressure?

09:42.348 --> 09:43.747
We're venting plasma.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.842
Reroute power to aft shields
and return fire.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.784
You're just prolonging
the inevitable.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.412
We've defeated the Borg before.

09:50.489 --> 09:51.751
We'll do it again.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.657
Not this time.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.888
Weapons are off-line.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.224
l'm losing thrusters.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.321
Shields are down.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.246
We were just getting
to the good part.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.179
lf the Continuum's
told you once,

10:17.249 --> 10:19.308
they've told you
a thousand times:

10:19.385 --> 10:23.321
Don't provoke the Borg!

10:23.389 --> 10:25.721
Now... l want you to give
Aunt Kathy your word,

10:25.791 --> 10:26.951
you won't do it again.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.186
Oh, he won't do it again,

10:29.261 --> 10:31.855
because he's leaving now.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.091
Excuse us, son.

10:33.165 --> 10:36.566
The grownups
need a moment in private.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.232
He isn't so bad,
once you get to know him.

10:42.341 --> 10:43.603
He's just misunderstood.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.837
He tried to kill my crew.

10:45.911 --> 10:46.843
No one was hurt.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.379
l-l repaired the damage
to your ship.

10:48.447 --> 10:51.177
l even gave your pet Talaxian
his vocal cords back.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.445
Everything's exactly as it was.

10:53.519 --> 10:56.454
And how long do you think
it will take your... son

10:56.522 --> 10:59.514
to come up with another way
to amuse himself?

10:59.592 --> 11:00.752
Oh...

11:02.161 --> 11:04.891
lf you knew he was dangerous,
why did you send him here?

11:04.964 --> 11:07.592
Ah, is this another
lesson for humanity?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.862
lt's supposed to be
a lesson for him.

11:09.969 --> 11:11.493
Think back to my last visit.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.731
l made you the offer
of a lifetime.

11:13.839 --> 11:14.771
Asking me to mate with you

11:14.840 --> 11:16.705
was hardly the offer
of a lifetime.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.708
lf you hadn't turned me down,

11:17.777 --> 11:19.142
l wouldn't
have been forced to mate

11:19.211 --> 11:20.178
-with that other Q.
-Oh, get to the point.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.304
My point is,

11:21.380 --> 11:24.042
Junior was supposed to inspire
peace and compassion,

11:24.116 --> 11:26.778
but instead of order,
he's brought chaos.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.787
He's been starting wars
among innocent species,

11:29.855 --> 11:32.187
tampering
with primordial gene pools,

11:32.258 --> 11:34.852
punching holes
in the fabric of space-time.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.452
Where's his mother been
during all this?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.293
She's been so humiliated
by his antics,

11:39.365 --> 11:40.627
she's disowned him,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.600
and she's blamed me
for everything.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.671
l've managed to undo
most of the damage,

11:45.738 --> 11:47.535
but that wasn't good
enough for the Continuum.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.336
They're hounding me to
straighten the boy out.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.377
That's why l brought him here,

11:52.478 --> 11:55.675
in hopes that your vaunted
Starfleet ideals

11:55.748 --> 11:57.010
would rub off on him.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.811
Obviously, that hasn't happened.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.045
You can't just dump
your child on someone

12:01.120 --> 12:02.712
and hope he learns something.

12:02.788 --> 12:03.720
l can't?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.120
He needs to be parented.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.455
And how exactly am l
supposed to do that?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.551
Q is the first child
born in the Continuum,

12:09.628 --> 12:11.687
which makes me the first parent.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.891
l don't even know
where to begin.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.968
You could start
by spending time with him.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.530
Parenthood is more

12:19.638 --> 12:22.505
than just cleaning up
your child's messes.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.543
You need to set an example.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.840
lt's the only way he'll learn.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.936
Of course.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.914
Once he begins to know me
better, he'll idolize me.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.644
Then he'll do anything l say.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.481
Kathy.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.416
You're a genius.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.453
l've made a full sensor sweep.

12:42.528 --> 12:46.157
There's no sign
of any more Borg vessels.

12:47.199 --> 12:48.325
The boy?

12:48.400 --> 12:49.332
He's gone.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.404
l am going to my quarters.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.996
You have the Bridge.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.972
l take it back--
you're not a genius.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.175
Mm. l should've known better

13:05.251 --> 13:06.718
than to take the advice
of a human.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.878
Q!

13:07.987 --> 13:09.579
Your brilliant plan didn't work.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.145
l smothered the boy
with attention,

13:11.223 --> 13:12.713
spent every waking moment

13:12.792 --> 13:14.885
with him,
but things only got worse.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.758
You've been gone
for less than ten minutes.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.856
On your temporal plane, maybe,
but in Q time,

13:20.933 --> 13:22.798
we've spent years together.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.564
Now he's embarrassed
to be seen with me,

13:25.671 --> 13:27.104
and it's all your fault.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.299
My fault?

13:28.407 --> 13:31.968
Tell me how you plan to rectify
the situation.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.674
What happened
after you left Voyager?.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.717
Well, Q got away from me

13:38.784 --> 13:42.948
and rearranged the tectonic
plates on Bozel Prime.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.580
Did you punish him?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.750
Well, l tried to get him
to apologize

13:46.826 --> 13:48.418
to all 16 billion Bozelians,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.962
but he got angry
and stopped talking to me.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.655
So you gave in to him.

13:52.731 --> 13:56.667
l told him he could shift
as many continents as he liked,

13:56.769 --> 13:58.737
as long as no one got hurt.

13:58.804 --> 14:02.706
You're not going to do your son
any favors by indulging him.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.201
You need to make him understand

14:05.277 --> 14:08.110
that there are consequences
to his actions.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.238
Consequences?

14:10.316 --> 14:11.578
Hmm.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.244
Kathy, l take it back.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.948
You are a genius.

14:24.663 --> 14:26.290
l think that's long enough.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.935
What was that for?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.436
What's wrong--
you didn't enjoy life

14:33.505 --> 14:34.995
as an Oprelian amoeba?

14:35.107 --> 14:38.838
No. l was shapeless and slimy.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.004
The only thing to eat
was paramecia.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.507
Sounds unpleasant.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.447
l'm sure you'll do
whatever you can

14:45.517 --> 14:47.576
to avoid returning
to that petri dish.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.177
What are you talking about?

14:49.255 --> 14:52.383
The Continuum and l
have come to an agreement

14:52.458 --> 14:53.720
about your future.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.125
Either you become
an upstanding citizen

14:57.196 --> 14:58.959
of the cosmos, or
you'll be sentenced

14:59.031 --> 15:01.499
to eternity as an amoeba.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.431
How's that for consequences?

15:03.535 --> 15:07.835
You'd turn your own son
into a microscopic life-form?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.875
You have one week
to change your ways.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.738
l suggest
you make the most of it.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.040
Fine.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.274
l'll see you in seven days.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.714
We've temporarily
relieved you of your powers,

15:23.789 --> 15:25.347
to ensure that you're

15:25.424 --> 15:27.016
on your best behavior
with the Captain.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.253
You're leaving me here?

15:29.328 --> 15:30.590
l thought we agreed

15:30.663 --> 15:33.097
that you were going to take
a more active role.

15:33.165 --> 15:36.157
l'd like to, Kathy,

15:36.235 --> 15:39.398
but we both know that you're
a million times the parent l am.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.631
l'm not a parent.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.798
Well, maybe not
in a biological sense,

15:42.908 --> 15:45.308
but you're certainly
a mommy to this crew.

15:45.377 --> 15:48.835
Just look how quickly
you housebroke that Borg drone.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.279
lt's taken years...

15:50.349 --> 15:53.284
for Seven to become
an individual.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.118
You're asking me to change
your son in one week?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.453
l'm sure you'll think
of something.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.355
What if she doesn't?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.887
Then it's single-cellular city
for you, my boy.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.694
l'm getting off this ship.

16:14.773 --> 16:18.038
Janeway to Security.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.873
What you no longer have, Q,

16:20.012 --> 16:23.209
is unlimited control
of space, matter and time,

16:23.282 --> 16:26.217
which means l give
the orders around here.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.946
Do l make myself clear?

16:29.655 --> 16:30.849
Your quarters.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.097
The petri dish was less cramped.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.760
Get some sleep--
you're going to need it.

16:44.870 --> 16:45.894
What for?

16:46.038 --> 16:47.335
l'm preparing a curriculum

16:47.406 --> 16:49.306
for you to follow
while you're here.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.471
You're going to learn respect
and responsibility.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.343
Don't tell me you're actually
going through with Q's plan.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.315
l may not approve
of his methods,

16:58.384 --> 17:01.547
but, for once, his heart
seems to be in the right place.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.752
l think his desire
to help you is genuine.

17:05.824 --> 17:09.920
He abandoned me on an antiquated
flying machine run by primates.

17:09.994 --> 17:13.396
We primates are your only hope.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.869
Seven days?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.269
How hard could it be?

17:26.979 --> 17:28.776
Seven of Nine will be
instructing you

17:28.847 --> 17:29.871
in spatial causality.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.472
You will learn how your actions

17:31.550 --> 17:33.245
can have widespread
repercussions.

17:33.318 --> 17:34.250
l read the padd.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.547
You're going to tell me

17:35.621 --> 17:39.057
how l can't create anomaly A
without causing phenomenon B,

17:39.124 --> 17:41.991
which, in turn, affects
civilization C, right?

17:45.664 --> 17:47.791
l'm... lcheb.

17:47.866 --> 17:48.798
Oh, l know who you are.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.459
You're the drone
with the Kirk fixation.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.037
You would be wise to follow
lcheb's example.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.105
By applying himself,

17:54.206 --> 17:56.299
he's become
a valued member of this crew.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.535
Can l see you naked again?

18:07.586 --> 18:11.044
Computer, run
Diplomacy Scenario 12-Alpha.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.191
The planetoid is
in Nausicaan space.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.351
lt belongs to us now.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.519
After you.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.189
Come anywhere near it,
and we'll attack you.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.697
You can't intimidate us.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.667
We've as much right to mine
that dilithium as you do!

18:23.769 --> 18:26.738
What are you doing here,
Starfleet?

18:26.805 --> 18:29.467
Computer, freeze program.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.408
l assume you're familiar
with these species.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.311
Nausicaan,
Bolian, Cardassian, Romulan,

18:35.380 --> 18:37.314
Ferengi, and Bajoran.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.748
They're fighting over the
mining rights to a planetoid.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.683
Your job is
to settle the dispute.

18:41.753 --> 18:45.018
These aliens mean nothing to me.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.887
What do l care
if they can't get along?

18:46.992 --> 18:49.358
One of your
responsibilities as a Q

18:49.428 --> 18:52.488
is to maintain order
in the universe, right?

18:52.564 --> 18:53.861
So l've been told.

18:53.932 --> 18:58.096
Well, if you can't help these
races come to an agreement,

18:58.203 --> 18:59.192
there might be a war.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.568
The Alpha Quadrant
would be thrown into chaos.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.264
Why don't we try

19:04.376 --> 19:06.344
running the first scenario
together?

19:07.379 --> 19:09.973
l don't need your help.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.515
l can do this myself.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.314
lf you want to try...

19:15.387 --> 19:16.513
be my guest.

19:16.588 --> 19:19.853
l'll be back in 30 minutes
to check on your progress.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.190
And... remember--

19:23.262 --> 19:25.560
Security is right outside.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.331
Computer, resume program.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.634
The planetoid
is in Nausicaan space.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.072
lt belongs to us now.

19:37.142 --> 19:38.404
You can't intimidate us.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.503
We have as much right to mine
that dilithium as you do.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.342
Aren't you supposed
to be supervising

19:46.418 --> 19:47.544
our young guest?

19:47.619 --> 19:49.780
He says he doesn't
need supervision.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.220
And you accepted that?

19:51.290 --> 19:52.416
Of course not.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.550
l'm just giving him
the chance to fail.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.560
Then he'll have to ask
for some help.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.357
Sounds like a good strategy.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.364
Let me know how it goes.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.204
Settling the planetoid
predicament

20:07.272 --> 20:08.569
didn't take very long,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.939
so l used the rest of the time
to convince the Cardassian

20:12.010 --> 20:14.444
to apologize for the occupation
of Bajor.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.777
How's that for order
in the universe?

20:18.183 --> 20:19.480
Welcome.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.883
lt's so nice to see you
this evening.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.148
l hope you're hungry.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.154
Step right up.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.054
There's plenty for everyone.

20:26.124 --> 20:27.489
Enjoy!

20:27.559 --> 20:28.651
Do you ever stop?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.787
Oh, l'm sorry.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.057
l forgot.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.565
My talking annoys you.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.259
Too bad you can't just...

20:38.537 --> 20:40.732
...shut me up again, huh?

20:40.839 --> 20:44.297
Crewman Biddle, where have
you been hiding yourself?

20:44.409 --> 20:45.842
l haven't seen you in days!

20:45.911 --> 20:47.003
lf it isn't drone boy.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.510
You come to put me to sleep

20:48.580 --> 20:50.673
with another one
of your presentations?

20:50.749 --> 20:53.582
Actually, l was wondering
if you'd like to participate

20:53.652 --> 20:55.313
in some
recreational activities.

20:55.387 --> 20:56.649
l don't have the time.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.816
Aunt Kathy's forcing me
to write an historical essay

20:59.891 --> 21:00.949
on the Q Continuum.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.857
That's a challenging subject.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.022
l've never written
an essay before.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.793
l don't know where to start.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.528
The origin of the Q seems
like the most logical place,

21:10.636 --> 21:13.605
followed by an analysis of their
interaction with humanity.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.196
You could conclude
with a description

21:15.307 --> 21:16.899
of the events
that led you to Voyager.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.942
Would you mind writing
some of this down for me?

21:20.045 --> 21:21.376
l'll get a padd.

21:25.384 --> 21:28.945
lnsightful, informative.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.384
l'm impressed.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.355
Too bad you didn't write it.

21:32.424 --> 21:33.914
What do you mean?

21:33.992 --> 21:37.723
l'd recognize lcheb's
style anywhere.

21:37.796 --> 21:42.256
He gave me a few notes
on my first draft, that's all.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.358
l negotiated a peace treaty

21:44.469 --> 21:48.371
between six belligerent species
in just 13 minutes.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.567
When Commander Chakotay
left the room,

21:50.642 --> 21:53.008
you altered their
personality subroutines

21:53.111 --> 21:54.772
to make them more agreeable.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.371
We may be common bipeds,

21:57.449 --> 22:01.180
but we're not stupid.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.187
Your training is over.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.517
Go back to your room

22:04.589 --> 22:06.250
and wait for your father
to return.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.314
lf you don't help me,

22:07.392 --> 22:09.553
the Continuum
will turn me into an amoeba.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.425
l wanted to help you,

22:11.496 --> 22:13.896
but instead of trying
to live up to your potential,

22:13.999 --> 22:15.557
you cheated.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.831
Do you think it's easy
to live up to my potential?

22:18.937 --> 22:22.873
l was supposed to be the savior
of the Q Continuum.

22:22.941 --> 22:26.570
Tell me, how do you save a race
that's already omnipotent?

22:26.645 --> 22:30.103
Those were the Qs' expectations,
not mine.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.707
All l asked was
that you make a sincere effort,

22:32.784 --> 22:34.752
but you weren't even
willing to try.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.720
Please, Aunt Kathy...

22:37.789 --> 22:40.223
you're my only hope.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.624
Well, l'm glad
you finally realize that.

22:44.329 --> 22:46.263
Now, if your motives are
sincere,

22:46.331 --> 22:48.731
l'm willing to give you
another chance.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.392
But step out of line again,

22:50.502 --> 22:52.766
and l'm through with you,
understood?

22:52.871 --> 22:53.895
Understood.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.302
Dismissed!

23:09.154 --> 23:12.817
Captain's Log, Stardate 54704.5.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.485
lt's been four days since
my ultimatum to the young Q,

23:15.560 --> 23:17.585
and he appears
to be making progress.

23:17.662 --> 23:19.857
His instructors inform me
that he's taking on

23:19.931 --> 23:21.592
his assignments
with new determination,

23:21.666 --> 23:23.031
and he's made a concerted effort

23:23.135 --> 23:25.433
to be more courteous
to the crew.

23:25.537 --> 23:26.799
lt's hard to believe this is

23:26.905 --> 23:29.874
the same brazen young man
that came aboard a few days ago.

23:29.941 --> 23:30.908
Captain?

23:31.042 --> 23:32.805
This is for you.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.106
lt's a new draft of my essay.

23:36.181 --> 23:37.773
l know you didn't ask for one,

23:37.849 --> 23:41.148
but l felt l owed it to you
for giving me a second chance.

23:41.219 --> 23:45.952
''l, Q: An lnsider's View
of the Continuum.''

23:46.091 --> 23:48.457
lf the essay is half as clever
as the title,

23:48.527 --> 23:49.858
l'm sure l'll enjoy it.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.825
Lieutenant Paris has offered
to give me a piloting lesson.

23:55.934 --> 23:56.901
l thought you might like
to join us.

23:56.968 --> 23:59.732
Oh, thanks, but l have
to help Crewman Chell

23:59.838 --> 24:01.669
scrub the plasma conduits.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.207
l think you've earned a break.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.506
This is the only time off
l'm giving you.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.512
l suggest
you take advantage of it.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.309
Yes, ma'am.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.510
Piloting lesson, huh?

24:13.585 --> 24:14.574
Where are we going?

24:21.092 --> 24:22.889
Steady...

24:22.994 --> 24:25.121
Ease up a little
on the thrusters.

24:27.365 --> 24:29.458
ln case you forgot,
l'm mortal now.

24:29.568 --> 24:33.095
l'd appreciate it if you didn't
fly us into a rock.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.436
Maybe Q could take over
for a little while.

24:36.508 --> 24:37.770
What do you say?

24:37.843 --> 24:39.333
You want a turn at the wheel?

24:39.444 --> 24:42.208
Ordinarily, a Q
wouldn't demean himself

24:42.280 --> 24:44.544
by operating
primitive machinery,

24:44.616 --> 24:47.517
but these aren't
ordinary circumstances.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.721
Uh, did l do something wrong?

24:56.795 --> 24:59.423
Just a little ion imbalance
in the impulse drive.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.829
Nothing to worry about.

25:00.932 --> 25:02.797
Well, it's very distracting.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.301
Can't you fix it?

25:04.369 --> 25:06.667
Well, l could, but we'd have
to go back to Voyager

25:06.771 --> 25:07.703
and run diagnostics.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.706
lf you two don't mind
cutting your lesson

25:09.808 --> 25:11.469
a little short.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.438
That won't be necessary.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.140
ln fact,
l barely hear it anymore.

25:16.214 --> 25:17.146
Do you hear it?

25:17.215 --> 25:18.580
Hear what?

25:24.756 --> 25:26.053
Going up?

25:26.124 --> 25:27.113
l'll catch the next one.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.183
Hmm.

25:37.969 --> 25:40.130
Oh, you can't get away
from me that easily.

25:40.238 --> 25:41.330
lt's only been five days.

25:41.439 --> 25:42.633
Why are you back?

25:42.741 --> 25:45.301
Oh, l thought l'd just pop in
and check on Junior.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.845
l'm not an entirely uninvolved
father, you know.

25:47.913 --> 25:49.881
Well, he got off
to a pretty shaky start,

25:49.948 --> 25:51.882
but he's made some progress
since then.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.247
Really!

25:53.318 --> 25:55.218
He's been working
extremely hard.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.879
We're talking about the same Q?

25:56.955 --> 25:58.217
lf you don't believe me,

25:58.290 --> 26:00.258
maybe you should
see for yourself.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.329
The Continuum has been perceived
in a variety of ways--

26:05.397 --> 26:06.659
a dreary desert road,

26:06.731 --> 26:08.426
a blood-soaked battleground--

26:08.500 --> 26:10.559
but with the help
of Voyager's crew,

26:10.669 --> 26:13.536
l've begun to perceive it
in another context-- a home.

26:13.605 --> 26:14.833
l look forward to the day

26:14.973 --> 26:17.032
when l return there
and make that perception

26:17.142 --> 26:19.804
a reality.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.881
Well?

26:23.949 --> 26:25.246
Huh?

26:25.317 --> 26:26.750
What did you think?

26:26.818 --> 26:28.479
Oh, it's very nice.

26:28.553 --> 26:29.417
Nice?

26:29.487 --> 26:30.579
Yes, l especially liked

26:30.655 --> 26:32.088
the part about the Continuum.

26:32.157 --> 26:35.888
The entire essay
was about the Continuum.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.986
Yes, and it's very nice.

26:39.064 --> 26:41.328
l'm late for my
temporal mechanics lesson.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.731
Q...

26:43.835 --> 26:46.463
Well, if there's nothing else,
l'll be on my way.

26:46.571 --> 26:47.902
He worked so hard
on that paper.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.235
The least you could have done

26:49.307 --> 26:50.774
was tell him
you were proud of him.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.103
But l'm not.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.069
And frankly, it's a little hard

26:55.146 --> 26:57.876
to be impressed with any
of the boy's accomplishments.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.816
He's been here for five days,
and what have you taught him?

27:00.885 --> 27:03.376
How to scribble essays
and play with holograms.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.945
What's next, basket weaving?

27:05.023 --> 27:06.718
Whether you're willing
to admit it or not,

27:06.791 --> 27:08.122
your son has made progress here.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.421
He has the potential

27:09.494 --> 27:11.052
to be a better Q
than you will ever be.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.962
Potential isn't going to be
enough for the Continuum.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.556
Then what will be enough?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.296
The boy needs to demonstrate
nothing less than...

27:18.403 --> 27:19.802
exemplary Q-ness.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.135
And what exactly is Q-ness?

27:22.207 --> 27:24.266
Oh, it's impossible
for your minuscule mind

27:24.376 --> 27:27.641
to comprehend,
but l know Q-ness when l see it,

27:27.712 --> 27:29.612
and this...

27:29.681 --> 27:31.478
is not it.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.694
Come in.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.394
l wanted to see how you were.

27:55.106 --> 27:57.074
l'm perfectly fine.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.075
Why wouldn't l be?

27:59.144 --> 28:02.978
l thought you might be upset
by Q's reaction to your essay.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.241
He's impossible to please.

28:07.318 --> 28:09.479
l don't care what he thinks.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.183
We have two days left.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.229
Let's make the most of them.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.600
Aunt Kathy...

28:23.668 --> 28:25.226
do you think the Continuum

28:25.336 --> 28:28.203
will be any more impressed
with me than Q was?

28:30.442 --> 28:33.002
That's what l thought.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.639
lf the Continuum decides
they won't take you back,

28:39.718 --> 28:42.516
l'll ask them
to let you stay here.

28:42.587 --> 28:46.353
l don't think they care
where an amoeba spends eternity.

28:46.424 --> 28:49.257
That's not what l meant.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.956
l'll ask them to let
you remain human.

28:55.467 --> 28:58.265
l appreciate that...

28:58.369 --> 29:01.566
but l don't want to be human.

29:01.673 --> 29:05.541
l want to be a Q...

29:05.577 --> 29:08.569
like my father.

29:16.988 --> 29:21.254
ltchy! Are you in here? ltchy?

29:21.326 --> 29:24.261
What can l do for you, Q-Ball?

29:24.329 --> 29:25.956
l need your help.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.962
Remember that ion imbalance
Lieutenant Paris mentioned

29:33.071 --> 29:34.629
during our lesson?

29:34.739 --> 29:36.707
We're going
to repair it for him.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.242
Did you get permission?

29:38.343 --> 29:39.708
Well, that would ruin
the surprise.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.006
The surprise?!

29:41.079 --> 29:42.546
The Captain's
been encouraging me

29:42.614 --> 29:43.876
to take more initiative.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.143
l want to show her
l can do things for others

29:46.217 --> 29:48.208
without being asked.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.777
l'll help you, on one condition.

29:50.855 --> 29:51.844
Name it.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.584
You won't refer to me as ''ltchy''

29:53.658 --> 29:55.387
in front of the senior officers.

29:59.197 --> 30:02.633
l've realigned the last pair
of power couplings.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.396
You can start
the preignition sequence.

30:05.503 --> 30:06.970
Understood.

30:09.607 --> 30:14.442
l'm not detecting
any ion fluctuations.

30:14.512 --> 30:15.945
We did it.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.378
You can power down
the engine now.

30:21.352 --> 30:22.842
Q?

30:24.289 --> 30:25.847
What are you doing?

30:25.924 --> 30:28.290
You're gonna love this.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.520
l once learned how
to open a spatial flexure,

30:30.595 --> 30:32.688
using nothing more
than a deflector array.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.755
''Flexure''?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.892
lt's like a tunnel
through space.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.765
l'm going to open one
to the Clevari system.

30:39.871 --> 30:41.099
Just wait
till you see the females.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.298
They're spectacular.

30:42.407 --> 30:45.240
We need the Captain's permission
to leave Voyager.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.107
Do you think
she'd give it to us?

30:47.178 --> 30:48.668
No.

30:48.746 --> 30:50.771
Then there's no point in asking.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.783
You've been doing so well.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.648
Why break the rules now?

30:54.719 --> 30:57.279
l'm bored.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.152
lcheb to Security.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.418
They can't hear you.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.550
l've dampened
all outgoing communications.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.189
Just sit back, ltchy.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.700
Enjoy the ride.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.069
What's the real reason
you're doing this?

31:22.146 --> 31:23.408
l'm getting out of here

31:23.481 --> 31:25.676
before my father can put me
back in that petri dish.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.115
The Q are omnipotent.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.447
They'll find you.

31:28.519 --> 31:32.148
l may not have my powers
anymore, but l know plenty

31:32.223 --> 31:35.420
of cosmic nooks and crannies
we can hide in.

31:35.493 --> 31:38.519
Voyager has locked onto us
with a tractor beam.

31:38.596 --> 31:40.496
They're so predictable.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.431
They're opening some sort of
spatial rift off their port bow.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.527
lt's disrupting
the tractor beam.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.470
Compensate.

31:56.814 --> 31:58.645
They're gone.

32:11.963 --> 32:15.626
Welcome to the Clevari system.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.498
What would you like to do first?

32:18.603 --> 32:20.935
Take a dip with
the mermaids of Golos Prime?

32:21.005 --> 32:23.132
Challenge the warrior goddess
of Fekdar

32:23.241 --> 32:24.503
to a grappling contest?

32:24.575 --> 32:26.634
What l want is
to return to Voyager.

32:26.711 --> 32:30.272
Forget that dreary ship,
with its rules and regulations.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.407
We can do anything we want here.

32:32.483 --> 32:33.472
Go back to Voyager.

32:33.551 --> 32:34.950
Apologize to the Captain.

32:35.019 --> 32:35.951
She'll help you.

32:36.020 --> 32:36.952
lt's too late.

32:37.021 --> 32:38.682
She said one more violation,

32:38.756 --> 32:40.451
l'll be thrown off her ship.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.425
l'm pretty sure this qualifies.

32:45.530 --> 32:46.963
What's wrong?

32:47.031 --> 32:48.828
There's a vessel approaching.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.531
You're trespassing
in Chokuzan space.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.902
We were just leaving.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.307
Our laws require
that you be incarcerated,

32:59.377 --> 33:00.742
pending an investigation.

33:00.845 --> 33:02.642
How long will that take?

33:02.680 --> 33:07.242
Disengage your engines
and prepare to be boarded.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.343
We should do as he says.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.583
Why, just because
he has a bigger ship?

33:12.657 --> 33:15.182
Because Captain Janeway has
taught us to respect the laws

33:15.259 --> 33:16.886
of other cultures.

33:16.961 --> 33:19.725
l should have known better
than to bring you along.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.831
You're going to get us killed!

33:27.939 --> 33:29.406
Did you expect me to surrender?

33:29.507 --> 33:31.270
He might have
locked us up for years.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.207
You don't know that.

33:33.277 --> 33:34.744
There's no time for a debate.

33:34.812 --> 33:36.279
l need you at Tactical.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.916
Shields are down to 30 percent.

33:43.988 --> 33:46.252
Sixteen percent.

33:46.324 --> 33:47.586
l'm opening another flexure!

33:47.658 --> 33:48.955
We'll go to the Zozek system.

33:49.093 --> 33:50.526
The girls aren't as attractive,

33:50.595 --> 33:52.460
but we have to make
some compromises.

33:59.904 --> 34:03.067
lcheb!

34:03.174 --> 34:05.642
l'm detecting
another rift forming...

34:05.710 --> 34:09.202
approximately 5,000 kilometers
directly ahead.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.770
A vessel is emerging.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.281
lt's the Flyer.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.476
They're hailing.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.451
-On screen.
-Aunt Kathy...

34:15.520 --> 34:17.078
Don't you ''Aunt Kathy'' me.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.121
Yell at me later.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.588
We need to get lcheb
to Sick Bay.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.326
His cells are being necrotized

34:25.396 --> 34:27.591
by some form
of omicron radiation,

34:27.665 --> 34:30.896
but l can't treat his injuries
without knowing more

34:31.002 --> 34:33.835
about the weapon
that caused them.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.463
ls this a bad time?

34:35.572 --> 34:37.473
Tell him.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.842
lcheb stole a shuttle
from Voyager.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.473
l tried to stop him,
but he kidnapped me,

34:44.549 --> 34:45.947
and he started a fight
with another ship.

34:46.016 --> 34:47.279
He stole the shuttle,

34:47.351 --> 34:49.045
and he attacked
the other vessel.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.382
ls that true, son?

34:52.456 --> 34:54.687
Please, Q, just save him.

34:54.759 --> 34:55.817
Don't be absurd.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.656
You're not going to help him?

34:57.728 --> 34:58.854
Like Aunt Kathy said,

34:58.930 --> 35:00.329
you're never going
to learn anything

35:00.431 --> 35:03.457
if you don't face the
consequences of your actions.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.992
lf your little playmate has
to die to teach you a lesson,

35:07.105 --> 35:09.232
so be it.

35:14.879 --> 35:16.176
l know you can hear me, Q.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.977
Come back! Q!

35:19.050 --> 35:20.608
You're wasting your time.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.245
He's the only one
who can save lcheb.

35:23.321 --> 35:24.811
No, he isn't.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.754
You're going back
to that ship you attacked.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.987
You're going to apologize
for what you did,

35:31.062 --> 35:32.859
and you're going
to plead with them

35:32.930 --> 35:35.660
for the information we need
to save lcheb.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.098
Look at what they did to him.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.135
lf l go back,
they'll do the same to me.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.329
What do you care?

35:40.438 --> 35:42.429
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be an amoeba.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.303
Well, l'd rather be an amoeba
than a corpse!

35:44.375 --> 35:45.637
That would be easier,

35:45.710 --> 35:46.938
wouldn't it?

35:47.044 --> 35:48.636
No expectations to live up to.

35:48.713 --> 35:50.203
No one to disappoint.

35:52.517 --> 35:55.111
l'm a failure as a Q
and a human.

35:55.186 --> 35:58.883
lf l'm a single-celled organism,
at least l can't hurt anybody.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.288
Why did you come back here?

36:01.392 --> 36:03.952
To escape the Chokuzan.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.722
You could've
used your technology

36:05.796 --> 36:10.233
to take you anywhere,
but you came back here to us.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.562
Why?

36:11.669 --> 36:14.695
l probably hit
the wrong control.

36:17.942 --> 36:20.410
lcheb is the only friend
l've ever had.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.876
l brought him back here,

36:22.013 --> 36:24.106
because l thought
you could save him.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.672
Obviously, l was mistaken.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.514
The only mistake you made
was running away.

36:28.586 --> 36:31.453
You have a chance
to do the right thing now.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.989
Don't waste it.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.192
The attack on your vessel
was entirely my fault.

36:44.302 --> 36:48.329
lcheb had nothing to do with it,
but he's the one who's dying.

36:48.439 --> 36:51.374
l-l take full responsibility
for what happened.

36:51.442 --> 36:53.637
l'll do anything you ask.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.440
Just help my friend.

36:55.513 --> 36:58.414
My crew and l will repair
any damage he did

36:58.482 --> 36:59.779
to your ship.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.909
Are you the adult
responsible for this child?

37:05.289 --> 37:07.450
l suppose l am.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.386
We'll accept his apology

37:10.461 --> 37:15.398
and give you the information
you need to save his accomplice,

37:15.466 --> 37:20.870
but you will be punished
for their crime.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.371
She didn't have anything
to do with it.

37:23.441 --> 37:25.409
ln our culture,
adults are accountable

37:25.476 --> 37:27.239
for the actions
of their children.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.040
l attacked your ship.

37:29.113 --> 37:32.173
l should be punished for it,
not her.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.775
You don't even know
what the punishment is.

37:34.852 --> 37:37.787
lt might be torture,
or even execution.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.288
l don't care,

37:39.357 --> 37:41.757
if it means saving my friend.

37:47.531 --> 37:49.726
Well done, Junior.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.394
l'm proud of you.

37:53.504 --> 37:56.302
Surprise!

37:57.808 --> 37:59.799
l wish you could see the look
on your faces.

37:59.910 --> 38:02.140
Oh, wait. You can.

38:03.848 --> 38:05.577
We don't have time
for your games.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.914
We need to find
the real people l attacked.

38:07.985 --> 38:09.384
You just did.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.785
l was the Chokuzan you fired on.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.450
What kind of horrible joke...?

38:14.525 --> 38:16.550
Not a joke. A test.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.094
l knew the pathetic
little exercises

38:18.162 --> 38:21.029
you had him performing
would not impress the Continuum.

38:21.098 --> 38:26.229
So, when he escaped your
clutches, l devised a real test.

38:26.337 --> 38:28.805
lt was touch and go there
for a moment,

38:28.906 --> 38:30.874
but you passed
with flying colors.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.966
What about lcheb?

38:33.077 --> 38:35.978
Your Doctor will discover
he's made a miraculous recovery.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.777
Now then,
if we're all finished here,

38:38.849 --> 38:41.113
it's Judgment Day for Junior.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.526
We're ready, Your Honor.

38:51.595 --> 38:55.463
ln the case
of The Continuum vs. Q,

38:55.533 --> 38:57.330
we, the Continuum, have found

38:57.435 --> 38:59.733
that Q has not
made sufficient progress

38:59.837 --> 39:02.601
to warrant the reinstatement
of his powers.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.766
Objection.
What about my test?

39:04.842 --> 39:06.810
What about it?

39:06.877 --> 39:08.970
Q was willing to sacrifice
himself to save his friend.

39:09.046 --> 39:11.480
Surely that counts
for something.

39:11.549 --> 39:13.346
lt was Q who endangered
the boy's life

39:13.417 --> 39:14.349
in the first place.

39:14.418 --> 39:17.410
However, in deference

39:17.488 --> 39:20.048
to the aforementioned
act of contrition,

39:20.124 --> 39:22.558
the defendant will not
be transformed

39:22.626 --> 39:24.287
into an Oprelian amoeba.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.590
Oh, good.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.494
lnstead...

39:27.565 --> 39:30.398
he will suffer
the next worst fate--

39:30.501 --> 39:32.594
remaining human.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.109
Court is adjourned.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.877
This is an outrage!

39:43.981 --> 39:46.711
They can't do this to me!

40:01.565 --> 40:03.692
Come in.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.826
Do you have a moment?

40:08.706 --> 40:13.040
A few days ago, you offered
to let me remain on Voyager.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.237
l know l've made
a few mistakes since then,

40:15.312 --> 40:17.303
and you probably
don't want me around,

40:17.381 --> 40:19.281
but if it's all right

40:19.350 --> 40:23.218
with you... l'd like
to continue my training.

40:23.287 --> 40:26.222
But you have nothing left
to prove to the Continuum.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.550
But there's a lot
l still need to prove to you.

40:31.328 --> 40:32.886
What about your father?

40:35.800 --> 40:38.098
You don't honestly believe
we'll see him again, do you?

40:38.202 --> 40:39.965
He obviously doesn't
want me around.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.470
Why else would he have
left me here... twice?

40:44.175 --> 40:46.166
The question
you should be asking

40:46.277 --> 40:47.767
is why l keep coming back.

40:47.878 --> 40:50.608
Now, l'm sorry
l left so abruptly,

40:50.681 --> 40:53.548
but the Continuum's verdict
demanded an immediate appeal.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.881
l told them l refuse to belong

40:55.953 --> 41:00.253
to any Continuum that wouldn't
accept my son as a member.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.155
We're a package deal.

41:02.226 --> 41:04.387
You left the Continuum for me?

41:04.462 --> 41:05.394
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.328
l'm the only one holding
that place together.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.798
And when they realized
they might lose me,

41:09.867 --> 41:12.495
they crumbled like a
Gelbian sand sculpture.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.832
They're going
to return my powers?

41:15.940 --> 41:17.237
They already have.

41:20.511 --> 41:25.505
For you, Captain,
for all your help.

41:25.583 --> 41:26.811
Thank you.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.687
Now that you're a Q again,

41:31.755 --> 41:34.121
l thought we might spend
some quality time together.

41:34.191 --> 41:38.093
l want to show you the cosmos
the way it was meant to be seen.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.390
We've tried that already.

41:39.463 --> 41:41.931
Things will be different
this time.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.193
l promise.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.335
Now run along.

41:47.404 --> 41:50.840
l'll meet you on Golos Prime.

41:50.941 --> 41:54.206
After l've had a few moments
alone with the Captain.

41:54.278 --> 41:55.836
l'll see you soon, Aunt Kathy.

41:55.913 --> 41:57.710
l certainly hope so.

42:00.417 --> 42:04.183
So, the Continuum ''crumbled
like a Gelbian sand sculpture.''

42:04.255 --> 42:06.280
Yes.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.824
Some of them even
got on their knees

42:07.892 --> 42:08.824
and begged me to stay.

42:08.893 --> 42:11.225
lt was pathetic.

42:13.898 --> 42:15.229
lf you must know,

42:15.299 --> 42:17.824
l had to agree
to a few minor conditions.

42:17.935 --> 42:19.664
Oh? Such as?

42:19.770 --> 42:21.738
Eternal custody of the boy.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.271
Wherever the little brat goes,
l go with him.

42:25.342 --> 42:28.140
l hope he won't spoil
too much of your fun.

42:29.747 --> 42:32.215
Oh, before l leave,

42:32.283 --> 42:35.081
l did a little homework for you.

42:35.152 --> 42:36.710
Consider it a thank you

42:36.787 --> 42:39.051
for everything you did
for Junior.

42:39.123 --> 42:41.216
Not that l don't appreciate it,

42:41.292 --> 42:44.261
but this will only take
a few years off our journey.

42:44.328 --> 42:47.229
Why not send us all the way?

42:48.832 --> 42:51.960
What sort of an example
would l be setting for my son

42:52.102 --> 42:54.002
if l did all the work for you?
