A ring?

00:19.100 --> 00:22.100
Governor, I have the horse.
There is a cost.

00:22.180 --> 00:24.140
A pardon for Silas Sharrow.

00:24.220 --> 00:27.580

is to utterly unseat Yeardley.

I promise you'll look as fine

03:21.860 --> 03:24.620
A great humiliation to me,

03:24.700 --> 03:28.580
to our country, when Silas Sharrow
adopted the heathen religion.

03:28.660 --> 03:32.380

07:07.820 --> 07:10.260

If a Pamunkey changes his name,
it's for a reason.

he must never board a ship.

himself as a factor.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.420
If this man were to break
accords of Jamestown,

19:20.500 --> 19:24.900
why should we not, then, deal
with him as no more than a factor
and not a Company agent?

19:25.940 --> 19:28.540
We might bring him
here to the jailhouse.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.580
And here, apply persuasion

19:30.660 --> 19:32.740
to encourage him
to send a report to England

19:32.820 --> 19:35.140
that might more...suit our wishes.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.900
Master Crabtree! Our Governor
would speak with you.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.140
He would inspect
your import papers, sir.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.180
A formidable feat, sir...

19:55.060 --> 19:58.940
..to so capture the Pamunkey
Sharrow and have him walk
behind your horse

19:59.020 --> 20:01.900
like a whipped dog.
How was it done?

20:01.980 --> 20:04.580
Authority, sir, and a musket.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.260
Didn't he press an arrow
against your flesh

20:07.340 --> 20:09.820
and wisp away once before?
How was it done -

20:09.900 --> 20:12.180
You doubt me, Master Crabtree?
Why do you doubt

20:12.260 --> 20:14.660
that I doubt you, sir?
Have I not made myself clear?

20:14.740 --> 20:16.780
How was it done?

20:16.860 --> 20:19.100
If you did not hide behind
your hump,

20:19.180 --> 20:21.420
I'd relish riding my sword
through your throat.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.940
I accept your challenge.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.980
Ah!

20:28.100 --> 20:31.260
We live in a day
of worshipping weapons.

20:31.340 --> 20:34.220
Once, when men were men,

20:34.300 --> 20:38.820
a dagger, a pistol, a musket -
these did not decide a duel.

20:40.020 --> 20:44.100
Fists served
as honest clubs of honour.

20:44.180 --> 20:46.220
It would be a kind day
I had opportunity

20:46.300 --> 20:49.140
to buckle the rest of your body
with my own hands.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.340
My father was a prizefighter.

20:51.420 --> 20:54.220

20:54.300 --> 20:57.500
Tongues too tight to boast.
But I had heard

20:57.580 --> 21:01.860
how they had killed men
by the number...with their fists.

21:01.940 --> 21:05.540
I would sneak out at night,
follow my pa,

21:05.620 --> 21:08.100
and watch in the dark
as his mighty arms

21:08.180 --> 21:12.020
swung down blows
with force enough to fell a bull.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.340
And me, his son,

21:16.540 --> 21:19.100
so freak-feebled,

21:19.180 --> 21:21.860
he could not fix his eyes
upon me for shame.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.300
I cast my own form in iron

21:24.380 --> 21:27.380
and waited the day
I would crush my father's jaw

21:27.460 --> 21:29.420

a bear!

23:17.980 --> 23:20.020

have me in the jailhouse, sir.

It's what I want.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.860
MAN: Here you go.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.620
A ship came here to Jamestown,

23:32.700 --> 23:35.180
The White Lion. You know it?

23:36.380 --> 23:39.900
It's the vessel that delivered
Maria and Pedro and their people.

23:39.980 --> 23:43.940
Mm. That business is mired
with mystery and intrigue.

23:45.180 --> 23:48.620
The blackamoors
were stolen from the Spanish.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.660
No-one yet knows who in England

23:50.740 --> 23:52.980
commissioned the pirates
to raid the vessel.

23:53.060 --> 23:57.340
After the cargo was unloaded here
and Yeardley gained these servants -

23:57.420 --> 23:59.980
He calls them "servants",

24:00.060 --> 24:02.660
but there is no end
yet named to their tenure,

24:02.740 --> 24:06.140
so some might better
name them...as slaves.

24:08.540 --> 24:12.340
The ship was abandoned and its
crew vanished into Virginia.

24:14.700 --> 24:17.620
They might be discovered yet.

24:17.700 --> 24:21.140

this land stretches, sir?

24:21.220 --> 24:25.580

You won't find them.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.420
You were once a huntsman
familiar with those trails.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.380
I do not wish to go.

24:34.460 --> 24:37.460
Oh, but you will.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.980
Chacrow, will you tell me
how it's to be done?

24:50.060 --> 24:52.740
When you tell me the last
of how gunpowder is made...

24:55.420 --> 24:57.420
..I will face you as a friend.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.940
It will be done with respect.

25:01.020 --> 25:03.260
You might come to me by the dock.

25:14.140 --> 25:17.340
Gunpowder can't be made
without saltpetre.

25:17.420 --> 25:20.700
Shit is mixed with ashes
and weeds and piss,

25:20.780 --> 25:23.260
and it rots until it decays
and crumbles.

25:23.340 --> 25:26.580
Then it is washed so that the
water leaches over it,

25:26.660 --> 25:28.900
then heated,
and when all the mist and damp

25:28.980 --> 25:32.300
rises up like a vapour,
there's left this salt.

25:32.380 --> 25:35.180
Pedro, can you pass us
some saltpetre?

25:39.660 --> 25:44.700

I drove that boy away with my
cruelty and my coward's heart.

38:12.140 --> 38:15.740
I drove that boy away with my
cruelty and my coward's heart.

38:22.580 --> 38:24.740
You say I have cured you
of your loneliness.

38:24.820 --> 38:29.700
Not you, madam, but
my heart's tenderness for you.

38:29.780 --> 38:32.100
You've outwitted me
at every turn.

38:32.180 --> 38:35.060
You're not a factor
nor a Company agent.

38:35.140 --> 38:37.620
You are a seemer, sir.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.860
A shape-shifter insists upon
mystery.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.500
Which Willmus Crabtree
am I to believe?

38:44.580 --> 38:46.780
Do you suppose the ring
will bring you

38:46.860 --> 38:48.940
full familiarity
with all that I am?

38:53.900 --> 38:55.900
If you feel sick,

38:57.060 --> 39:01.180
it is not a fatal poison,
merely a sleeping potion.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.220
(CHUCKLING)

39:06.460 --> 39:10.860
Well, what will we do
to pass the time until I am taken?

39:12.300 --> 39:14.300
Shall I unpick my own wits

39:14.380 --> 39:16.340
and tell you of the moment
that I was won?

39:20.060 --> 39:22.060
(OWL CALL)

39:33.340 --> 39:35.540
(IMITATES OWL CALL)

39:42.300 --> 39:44.300
(CRICKETS CHIRRUP)

39:47.140 --> 39:50.100
You... You drove that boy away.

39:51.900 --> 39:53.900
You drove that boy away.

40:04.180 --> 40:06.780
Your own cruelty, Meredith Rutter.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.780
Your own coward's heart!

40:28.940 --> 40:30.940
As I walked here,

40:32.580 --> 40:35.220
I saw the world as you
taught me to see it, Chacrow.

40:36.580 --> 40:39.260
So, for that reason,
I can't give you the last part

40:39.340 --> 40:41.300
of making gunpowder.
(SIGHS)

40:43.940 --> 40:47.620
I drove that boy away. Your
own cruelty, Meredith Rutter.

40:47.700 --> 40:50.140
Your own coward's heart.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.700
There ain't nothing
worse than there is.

40:53.780 --> 40:55.820
Is this what you intended?

40:55.900 --> 40:58.580
To mock me
so that I live in your shadow?

41:00.980 --> 41:03.900
To pretend that you will show
your love to me?

41:05.740 --> 41:09.740
I have seen what this thing
we call "progress"

41:09.820 --> 41:11.780
has done to the English,

41:11.860 --> 41:14.020
and I will not be the man
who brings it to you.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.940
Opechancanough knows what is true.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.740
I do this because I love you.

41:33.820 --> 41:35.140
(GRUNTS)

41:35.220 --> 41:36.540
(SIGHS)

41:36.620 --> 41:39.860
Silas Sharrow has bit me
with lies!

41:42.740 --> 41:44.740
(CHOKES)

41:51.300 --> 41:53.300
(BOTH GRUNTING)

41:55.220 --> 41:57.220
(YELLS)

42:12.540 --> 42:14.540
Raise the alarm!

42:15.740 --> 42:17.940
Master Rutter's fallen!

42:19.100 --> 42:21.100
Raise the alarm!
(MEREDITH GROANING)

42:26.260 --> 42:28.260
(EXCLAIMS)

42:38.740 --> 42:40.740
(COUGHS)

43:01.700 --> 43:03.700
You hold the King's own signet.

43:07.100 --> 43:09.180
You are the most powerful man
in Virginia.

43:16.580 --> 43:18.580
(CHUCKLES)

43:19.580 --> 43:23.460
You are cursed with
descendancy. All the way back
to the days of the Bible,

43:23.540 --> 43:26.620
your kind have been marked out
for servitude.
The King's signet

43:26.700 --> 43:28.660
gives you full right
over the Governor.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.580
Why have you not cut him down?
There is business yet to play.

43:31.660 --> 43:36.300
There is a way to undo this man.
It is to take him to madness.

43:36.380 --> 43:40.260
(Do not so much as speak of my
business to the air.) (GASPS)

43:40.340 --> 43:42.300
Why did you keep it from me?

43:44.020 --> 43:46.020
(GRUNTS)

43:46.100 --> 43:49.260
Do you not see me
as a man like other men?

43:49.340 --> 43:51.580
