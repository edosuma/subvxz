WEBVTT

00:53.621 --> 00:56.290
Male voice:
You have no messages.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.691
( beeps )

00:57.791 --> 01:00.994
OH, GOD, PAUL.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.464
IF YOU'RE NOT COMING,
COULDN'T YOU JUST CALL

01:03.564 --> 01:05.733
AND TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT COMING?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.468
( knocks on door )

01:08.402 --> 01:11.105
( theme music playing )

01:28.589 --> 01:30.191
PAUL.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.528
ARE YOU GOING OUT?

01:35.329 --> 01:38.499
YOU LOOK GREAT.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.100
THANK YOU.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.906
WELL, I'D ASK YOU
WHERE YOU WERE GOING,

01:46.006 --> 01:47.341
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE

01:47.441 --> 01:49.843
YOUR BOUNDARIES
AS A THERAPIST.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.858
LOOK, I HATE TO DO THIS,

02:04.958 --> 02:07.828
I HATE IT
WHEN MY PATIENTS DO IT,

02:07.928 --> 02:09.863
BUT I'VE ASKED
MY LAWYER TO CALL ME

02:09.963 --> 02:12.966
ABOUT THE HEARING.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.370
AND I'D RATHER BE HERE

02:16.470 --> 02:19.873
IF IT'S BAD NEWS, OKAY?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.875
SURE.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.512
I WAS SO RELIEVED

02:24.612 --> 02:26.814
THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK
FOR THE LETTER.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.949
I DECIDED NOT TO SEND IT.

02:29.049 --> 02:32.186
YEAH, I WAS HAVING LUNCH

02:32.286 --> 02:34.388
WITH THE KIDS LAST SUNDAY

02:34.488 --> 02:37.325
AND ROSIE ACTUALLY ASKED ME
ABOUT THE CASE.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.560
AND I TOLD HER ABOUT
THE SETTLEMENT OFFER,

02:39.660 --> 02:42.230
AND SHE SAID,
"DAD, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.065
YOU CAN'T CONFESS
TO SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.867
YOU'RE THE GOOD GUY."

02:46.967 --> 02:49.703
SHE'D BEEN SO RUDE TO ME
ALL NIGHT ABOUT OTHER STUFF.

02:49.803 --> 02:54.141
I GUESS SHE'S STILL ANGRY
ABOUT THE DIVORCE.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.676
AND THEN SUDDENLY
IN ONE SENTENCE

02:55.776 --> 02:57.645
SHE MADE ME FEEL BETTER
THAN I'D FELT ALL WEEK.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.280
I'M GLAD.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.349
SO THEN I CALLED
MY LAWYER

03:01.449 --> 03:04.017
AND I SAID I WASN'T INTERESTED
IN THE SETTLEMENT,

03:04.117 --> 03:07.120
WHICH MEANT
THEY WENT THROUGH

03:07.221 --> 03:10.324
WITH THE HEARING
THIS MORNING.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.159
SO HOW DID THAT GO?

03:12.260 --> 03:14.795
I DON'T KNOW YET.
I WASN'T THERE.

03:14.895 --> 03:19.867
THE LAWYER SAID TECHNICALLY
I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.269
YOU DIDN'T GO?

03:21.369 --> 03:23.671
I OVERSLEPT.

03:23.771 --> 03:27.241
AND WHY DO YOU THINK YOU CHOSE
THIS MORNING TO OVERSLEEP?

03:27.341 --> 03:30.344
OH, YEAH,
THE SUBCONSCIOUS THING.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.480
PROBABLY BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

03:32.580 --> 03:36.317
AND I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE BEGGING SOME JUDGE

03:36.417 --> 03:38.185
TO LET ME KEEP MY JOB.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.654
YOU FELT SHOWING UP
WOULD BE BEGGING?

03:41.289 --> 03:43.223
I DON'T KNOW.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.730
SO WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED UP?

03:51.699 --> 03:54.302
I WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.137
YOU WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT MY LIFE?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.873
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.809
EXACTLY.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.012
I'D RATHER TALK ABOUT
HOW YOUR LAWYER FELT
THE HEARING WENT.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.547
DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.516
YEAH, HE SAID
NOT TO QUOTE HIM--

04:08.616 --> 04:10.618
'CAUSE THESE GUYS
HATE TO BE QUOTED--

04:10.718 --> 04:13.721
BUT HE SAID
THAT HE THOUGHT

04:13.821 --> 04:16.390
THAT IT WENT WELL.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.861
DID HE SAY
WHEN YOU'D FIND OUT?

04:20.961 --> 04:24.031
ANYTIME BETWEEN TODAY
AND GOD-KNOWS-WHEN.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.534
SO YOU'RE IN LIMBO.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.469
CAUGHT BETWEEN
HEAVEN AND HELL,

04:28.569 --> 04:31.872
WAITING FOR MY FATE
TO BE DECIDED, YEAH.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.642
THAT MUST BE WHAT THIS WHOLE
YEAR HAS FELT LIKE TO YOU.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.209
YOU'VE BEEN
UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.546
YEAH.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.614
IS THAT WHY
YOU DRESSED UP?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.754
THAT BLUE LOOKS
REALLY REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.490
IT'S THE SAME COLOR
AS THE DRESS YOU HAD ON

04:49.590 --> 04:51.659
THAT NIGHT I SAW
YOU AND DAVID

04:51.759 --> 04:54.362
COMING OUT
OF THAT COUNTRY CLUB
ON THE EASTERN SHORE.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.965
IT WAS THE 4th OF JULY.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.433
I REMEMBER.

04:59.533 --> 05:04.338
I HAD THIS CRUMMY
SUMMER JOB.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.574
I WAS PARKING CARS,

05:06.674 --> 05:10.611
AND I BROUGHT OUT
THE WRONG CAR.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.481
AND HE ASKED ME TO GO BACK
AND GET HIS CONVERTIBLE.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.883
AND I LOOKED AT HIM
AND I THOUGHT,

05:15.983 --> 05:19.052
"OF COURSE.
WHY WOULDN'T SHE BE WITH HIM?"

05:19.152 --> 05:21.088
YEAH, WE HAD
A WONDERFUL DINNER

05:21.188 --> 05:22.856
AND WE DANCED.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.858
AND THEN WE CAME OUTSIDE
AND THERE WAS

05:24.958 --> 05:27.561
MY MOST DEDICATED
GRADUATE STUDENT.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.031
WE WERE ALL
SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.233
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.236
HOW COULD WE NOT BE?

05:36.336 --> 05:40.140
YOU WERE BRILLIANT

05:40.240 --> 05:44.044
AND WE BELIEVED
EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.679
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.615
YOU ARGUED WITH
EVERYTHING THAT I SAID.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.149
YEAH, BUT YOU MADE US
DO THAT.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.784
THAT WAS YOUR TECHNIQUE.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.626
WE WERE
SO FASCINATED BY YOU.

05:59.860 --> 06:04.364
WE WANTED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.942
WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH YOU TODAY, PAUL?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.711
WHAT IS IT YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT--

06:17.811 --> 06:20.948
WHAT HAPPENED HERE
BETWEEN US LAST WEEK,

06:21.048 --> 06:23.684
OR YOUR CASE,

06:23.784 --> 06:26.053
OR YOUR PATIENTS,
YOUR CHILDREN?

06:26.153 --> 06:28.989
NO, NONE OF THE ABOVE.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.525
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT IT IS?

06:31.625 --> 06:34.595
( phone buzzing )

06:37.498 --> 06:39.232
IT'S MY LAWYER.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.401
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT ME TO STAY?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.970
PLEASE.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.008
( phone beeps )

06:48.108 --> 06:49.643
HELLO, ELLIS.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.313
I just spoke
with your judge.
I've got news.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.515
WHAT SORT OF NEWS?

06:54.615 --> 06:56.850
First off,
he was livid.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.586
AT ME?

06:58.686 --> 07:01.689
No, at Mr. Prince,

07:01.789 --> 07:04.257
for wasting
everybody's time.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.527
The judge hasn't written
the ruling yet,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.829
and he said
not to quote him,

07:08.929 --> 07:12.032
but there are
no triable issues of fact.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.502
WHAT?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.336
He said
it's a tragic story,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.472
but he's going to
dismiss the action.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.308
He's throwing
the case out.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.612
ARE YOU SAYING
IT'S OVER, ELLIS?

07:24.712 --> 07:26.780
I'm glad for you.
I know this thing
was a weight.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.782
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
YOU KNOW.

07:28.882 --> 07:33.086
I REALLY APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.122
AND LOOK, I KNOW

07:35.222 --> 07:37.891
I HAVEN'T BEEN THE EASIEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD
TO DEAL WITH,

07:37.991 --> 07:41.562
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.764
Nobody's nice when
they're being sued.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.133
The important thing is
justice was served.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.936
Come see me next week.
We'll go over it.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.905
But tonight you go out
and celebrate.
You hear me?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.341
YEAH.
THANKS, ELLIS.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.109
GOODBYE.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.312
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.915
OH MY GOD,
IT'S AMAZING.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.852
I'M SO GLAD THIS JUDGE
COULD SEE WHAT THE TRUTH WAS.

08:04.952 --> 08:09.022
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK IT'S GONNA BE
BEFORE I REALLY FEEL IT?

08:09.122 --> 08:11.959
BEFORE YOU
WAKE UP SOME MORNING
NOT THINKING ABOUT IT?

08:12.059 --> 08:14.528
OR NOT GO TO BED SOME NIGHT
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.964
THAT'S SO GREAT.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.933
NOW YOU KNOW YOU CAN
KEEP YOUR PRACTICE.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.574
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

08:26.674 --> 08:29.977
YOU WERE IN LIMBO ABOUT THAT
LAST WEEK AS WELL.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.984
HOW DID YOU DO WITH YOUR
PATIENTS THIS WEEK?

08:37.084 --> 08:39.019
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU
TO SEE THEM?

08:39.119 --> 08:42.189
WELL, I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.992
I ACTED AS IF I BELIEVED

08:45.092 --> 08:46.960
I REALLY WAS HELPING.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.996
AND DID THAT HELP?

08:49.096 --> 08:50.497
TO BE HONEST,

08:50.598 --> 08:52.866
I WAS KIND OF
SKEPTICAL AT FIRST.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.068
I FELT A BIT LIKE
A HYPOCRITE,

08:55.168 --> 08:57.537
AND THAT THEY'D SEE THAT.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.206
OF COURSE
YOU'D FEEL THAT WAY.

08:59.306 --> 09:03.677
BUT THEN WEIRDLY ENOUGH,
SOMETHING STARTED TO HAPPEN.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.313
I WAS TALKING
TO OLIVER'S DAD

09:06.413 --> 09:08.481
ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY

09:08.582 --> 09:10.483
OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A FATHER

09:10.584 --> 09:14.688
AND KEEPING IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR KID.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.390
REALLY, I WAS TALKING
FOR BOTH OF US.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.960
BUT I THINK
I REACHED HIM.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.996
I MEAN, I WAS STILL
DOUBTING MYSELF,

09:23.096 --> 09:25.933
BUT I JUST KEPT
AT IT, YOU KNOW?

09:27.735 --> 09:30.270
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT SOMETHING SO SIMPLE

09:30.370 --> 09:34.207
COULD ACTUALLY WORK.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.310
AND IT KEPT WORKING,
YOU KNOW?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.578
NO.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.949
YOU'RE A GOOD THERAPIST.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.451
AND I'M SURE YOU DID A LOT
OF GOOD WORK THIS WEEK,

09:44.551 --> 09:47.120
DESPITE HOW UNCERTAIN
YOU FELT.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.196
APRIL LEFT.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.065
THERAPY?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.700
WHY?

09:59.800 --> 10:03.837
IN PART BECAUSE
I TOOK HER TO CHEMO.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.874
I DON'T REGRET IT,

10:06.974 --> 10:10.410
BUT IT DID ALTER
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.780
OF COURSE.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.615
BUT ALSO I THINK
SHE JUST NEEDED

10:15.716 --> 10:18.819
TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT HERSELF.

10:18.919 --> 10:23.490
SHE WANTED SOME SPACE.

10:23.590 --> 10:26.093
SHE WANTED TO BREATHE,

10:26.193 --> 10:28.095
TO LIVE.

10:28.195 --> 10:32.432
AND DID YOU TRY
TO CONVINCE HER TO STAY?

10:32.532 --> 10:34.467
OF COURSE I DID.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.303
I'M WORRIED THAT SHE
DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS

10:36.403 --> 10:38.605
TO SURVIVE ANOTHER CRISIS.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.640
BUT PART OF ME,
I HAVE TO SAY,

10:40.741 --> 10:42.442
IS REALLY PROUD OF HER.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.411
FOR REJECTING YOU?

10:46.814 --> 10:48.849
FOR REJECTING THERAPY.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.619
I MEANT, FOR ACTING OUT
AGAINST YOU.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.088
THAT'S NOT WHAT
SHE WAS DOING, THOUGH.

10:55.188 --> 10:59.492
SHE WASN'T PUNISHING ME
OR HER PARENTS.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.228
SHE'S FIGHTING CANCER.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.431
SHE NEEDS ALL
OF HER ENERGY FOR THAT.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.433
AND YOU WERE ABLE
TO ACCEPT THAT?

11:06.533 --> 11:09.336
I WAS SURPRISED
BY MY REACTION.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.404
( chuckles )

11:11.504 --> 11:15.776
I KNOW I HAVE
THIS NEED TO RESCUE,

11:15.876 --> 11:19.679
BUT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD
HER REASONING

11:19.780 --> 11:21.448
COMPLETELY.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.419
YOU KNOW,
WALTER AND APRIL--

11:26.519 --> 11:30.824
THEY BOTH THINK
THAT THE WORLD IS
SUPPOSED TO BE

11:30.924 --> 11:32.993
ON THEIR SHOULDERS,

11:33.093 --> 11:37.697
AND THEY'RE BOTH INCAPABLE
OF RECEIVING SUPPORT.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.666
ONE'S STOPPING THERAPY.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.770
THE OTHER WANTS
MORE SESSIONS.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.938
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO CONTINUE.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.378
YOU KNOW WHAT
I REALIZED THIS WEEK?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.146
PRACTICING THIS WAY,

11:53.246 --> 11:56.149
I MAY NEVER KNOW WHETHER
I HELP PEOPLE OR NOT.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.251
IT'S NOT
LIKE I'M TRYING

11:58.351 --> 11:59.987
TO GET THEM TO PASS
THEIR DRIVING TEST

12:00.087 --> 12:02.122
OR DO BETTER
ON THEIR SATs
OR SOMETHING.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.459
THE ONLY MEASURE I HAVE
OF WHETHER I'M HELPING
SOMEBODY OR NOT

12:06.559 --> 12:09.529
IS HOW MY PATIENTS
FEEL ABOUT IT

12:09.629 --> 12:13.466
AND HOW THEIR LIVES
GO ON FROM THERE.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.035
AND THEY WON'T KNOW THAT

12:15.135 --> 12:17.370
UNTIL LONG AFTER
WE'VE STOPPED THERAPY.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.139
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, PAUL?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.274
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT THESE PEOPLE COME TO ME

12:21.374 --> 12:24.077
AND THEY WANT ME
TO FIX THEIR PROBLEMS,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.013
AND THE TRUTH IS,
I THINK ALL I CAN DO

12:26.113 --> 12:29.783
IS JUST WALK
WITH THEM FOR A WHILE,

12:29.883 --> 12:31.819
KEEP THEM COMPANY
DURING A ROUGH PATCH.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.587
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S LIFE
CAN BE FIGURED OUT,

12:34.687 --> 12:36.523
BUT IT IS IN OUR NATURE

12:36.623 --> 12:38.525
TO KEEP TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE OF IT.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.493
AND SOMETIMES
WE CAN USE HELP.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.130
THAT'S WHEN, IF WE'RE LUCKY,
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM

12:43.230 --> 12:45.698
WHO CAN LISTEN.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.700
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
SOMEBODY PERFECT--

12:47.801 --> 12:51.004
SOMEBODY SUFFICIENTLY
SCREWED UP

12:51.104 --> 12:53.773
TO ACTUALLY GET WHAT
WE MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.776
- SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
- ON OCCASION.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.146
AND NOT SOMEONE LIKE ME.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.383
NO, GINA.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.286
NOT FOR ME.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.221
NOT ANYMORE.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.825
OH.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.595
WHEN DID YOU COME
TO THIS CONCLUSION?

13:15.695 --> 13:17.364
I DON'T KNOW.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.500
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THIS PERSONALLY, GINA.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.602
NO NO NO.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.872
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT--

13:27.307 --> 13:31.444
NO, I'M NOT TAKING IT
PERSONALLY.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.981
I'M JUST--

13:35.582 --> 13:38.151
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED
THAT WE'RE HERE AGAIN.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.487
I KNOW.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.924
I KNOW.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.529
BUT IT IS DIFFERENT
THIS TIME.

13:49.629 --> 13:53.566
- I'M NOT DOING THIS
IN ANGER.
- MM-HMM.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.702
AND I APPRECIATE

13:55.802 --> 13:57.437
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.007
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.
- THANK YOU.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.010
LET'S NOT DRAG IT OUT,
YOU KNOW.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.845
AFTER LAST WEEK, REALLY,
WHAT IS THERE TO SAY?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.847
I UNDERSTAND.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.117
I JUST WANT TO BE SURE
YOU'RE AWARE

14:10.217 --> 14:13.220
OF WHY YOU'RE DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.956
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK
I'M NOT AWARE OF?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.891
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
LAST WEEK TOOK A TOLL--

14:17.991 --> 14:21.094
A BIG TOLL
ON BOTH OF US,

14:24.932 --> 14:29.302
I KNOW THAT
I CROSSED A LINE,

14:29.402 --> 14:33.240
BUT YOU ALSO LOST
TWO PATIENTS THIS WEEK.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.008
I KNOW.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.144
WELL, HAS IT
OCCURRED TO YOU

14:37.244 --> 14:39.446
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY AT THEM
FOR ABANDONING YOU,

14:39.546 --> 14:42.315
AND THAT MAY BE WHY YOU'VE
DECIDED TO ABANDON ME?

14:42.415 --> 14:45.585
THAT'S A LITTLE REDUCTIVE,
ISN'T IT?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.720
NO, BUT THIS IS:

14:47.820 --> 14:50.857
YOU BEGAN THE WEEK
QUESTIONING YOUR VALUE
AS A THERAPIST,

14:50.958 --> 14:52.725
AND YOU'RE ENDING IT
QUESTIONING MINE.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.594
I'M NOT QUESTIONING YOU.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.497
I'M QUESTIONING THE WAY
WE INTERACT, YOU AND I.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.800
I DON'T THINK IT'S HEALTHY
FOR EITHER OF US.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.569
YOU'RE ALWAYS
QUESTIONING ME,

15:02.669 --> 15:04.671
BLAMING ME.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.206
I THINK I'VE COME
TO REPRESENT

15:06.306 --> 15:09.209
EVERYTHING YOU STRUGGLE WITH
IN YOUR WORK--

15:09.309 --> 15:12.412
EMOTIONAL RESTRAINT,
DELAYED GRATIFICATION,

15:12.512 --> 15:15.682
NOT INDULGING YOUR LOVE OR
YOUR DESIRE FOR A PATIENT.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.751
YOU'VE MADE ME
YOUR BOUNDARY COP--

15:18.851 --> 15:21.221
THE MENTOR
WHO'S PREVENTED YOU

15:21.321 --> 15:23.656
FROM HAVING ANYTHING
YOU EVER WANTED.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.658
AND I BEAT YOU UP
FOR THAT.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.860
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
EXHAUSTING

15:27.961 --> 15:31.999
TO HAVE TO PLAY MY MOTHER
ALL THESE YEARS.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.134
IF I CAME RUNNING TO YOU,

15:34.234 --> 15:36.436
IT WAS BECAUSE
I NEEDED MY MOTHER.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.372
IF WAS ANGRY AT YOU,
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS
ANGRY AT MY MOTHER.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.908
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU PUT UP WITH IT.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.177
BUT YOU DID,
AND YOU GOT ME THROUGH IT.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.015
ALL I'M SAYING IS, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO IT ANYMORE.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.217
YOU'RE RELEASING ME NOW.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.451
YES.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.153
YES, I AM.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.592
YOU KNOW, PAUL,

15:59.692 --> 16:03.363
IF YOU NEED TO GO, YOU GO.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.166
BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT
YOU MAY BE PUNISHING ME

16:06.266 --> 16:09.169
BECAUSE I FAILED
TO PROTECT YOU.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.272
BUT YOU DIDN'T
FAIL ME, GINA.

16:12.372 --> 16:16.609
THIS HAS BEEN
MY SANCTUARY.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.679
ALL THE PARTS OF MYSELF
THAT I DON'T LIKE,
THAT I'M ASHAMED OF--

16:19.779 --> 16:23.716
I COULD BRING THEM HERE,
AND IT WAS ALWAYS OKAY.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.718
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S A CONNECTION

16:25.818 --> 16:28.455
BETWEEN THE LAWSUIT ENDING
AND YOUR STOPPING THERAPY?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.923
NO NO.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.360
IT'S JUST TIME.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.130
THE THINGS I NEEDED
FOR SO LONG HAVE CHANGED.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.933
I CAN'T KEEP
COMING TO YOU

16:41.034 --> 16:44.104
FOR THE MOTHERING
I DIDN'T GET,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.406
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO PROVIDE IT.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.408
SO YOU'RE NOT
RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME?

16:48.508 --> 16:51.211
I'D RATHER THINK OF IT
AS MOVING OUT.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.946
I'M GOING TO MAKE
MY WAY IN THE WORLD.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.148
WHERE WILL YOU GO?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.417
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.352
I'M STILL GOING TO KEEP
BEING A THERAPIST--

16:59.452 --> 17:04.224
MAYBE NOT ALL
PRIVATE SESSIONS.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.194
SOME DAYS I JUST SIT THERE
IN THE ROOM WITH A PATIENT

17:07.294 --> 17:10.663
AND I FEEL LIKE--
I DON'T KNOW--

17:10.763 --> 17:12.465
I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE TWO MICE

17:12.565 --> 17:16.002
WITH OUR LEGS CAUGHT
IN A GLUE TRAP.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.937
OH, GOD.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.039
IT'S A HORRIBLE FEELING.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.442
MAYBE IT'S THE CHAIR.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.513
I HATE THAT FUCKING CHAIR.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.448
YOU COULD GET A NEW ONE.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.483
I DID.
IT FELT GOOD IN THE STORE.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.685
BUT HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT A CHAIR--

17:32.785 --> 17:34.487
YOU NEVER
REALLY REALLY KNOW

17:34.587 --> 17:37.324
UNTIL YOU'VE SAT IN IT
FOR 40 HOURS A WEEK

17:37.424 --> 17:39.992
FOR A MONTH--
MONTH IN, MONTH OUT.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.528
BY THEN IT'S TOO LATE.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.263
DO YOU WANT TO PRACTICE
STANDING UP?

17:43.363 --> 17:46.166
( laughs )
MAYBE.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.901
MAYBE I NEED TO BE
IN A GROUP PRACTICE,

17:49.001 --> 17:50.803
SO AT LEAST
WHEN A PATIENT LEAVES

17:50.903 --> 17:53.306
I COULD GO INTO THE LOUNGE
AND RUN INTO SOME OTHER PEOPLE

17:53.406 --> 17:55.308
AND TALK
ABOUT POLITICS OR BOOKS

17:55.408 --> 17:57.244
OR ANYTHING,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.712
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT SUPERVISING?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.748
I DON'T THINK

18:01.848 --> 18:04.884
I'M AT A ROLE-MODEL PLACE
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW, GINA.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.220
I THINK YOU'D BE
A GOOD SUPERVISOR.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.390
I MEAN, YOU'D HAVE COMPASSION
FOR YOUR STUDENTS.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.192
AND THE MORE
A SUPERVISOR HAS SEEN,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.060
THE MORE VALUABLE
HE CAN BE.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.129
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
AT THIS POINT

18:16.229 --> 18:19.466
THAT NO CASE WOULD
SHOCK OR SURPRISE YOU.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.735
THAT WOULD MAKE A YOUNG
THERAPIST FEEL VERY SAFE.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.504
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.573
THE ONE THING
I HAVE FIGURED OUT--

18:26.673 --> 18:30.643
I JUST NEED TO BE
WITH MORE PEOPLE.

18:30.743 --> 18:35.182
I DON'T NEED A BREAK
FROM BEING A THERAPIST.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.718
I NEED A BREAK FROM--

18:38.818 --> 18:41.087
JUST FROM THIS,

18:41.188 --> 18:42.889
YOU KNOW?

18:42.989 --> 18:46.859
I NEED TO STOP
ANALYZING MY LIFE.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.128
I NEED TO START LIVING IT.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.499
I NEED YOU TO LET ME GO.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.336
WELL, PART OF ME
WOULD LOVE TO.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.439
I JUST WORRY
ABOUT THE TIMING.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.041
YOU'RE STILL IN MOURNING.
YOU'RE ALONE.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.843
YOU'RE ISOLATED.

19:03.943 --> 19:07.113
YOU DON'T HAVE A LIFE
OUTSIDE OF YOUR PRACTICE.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.482
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT ME OR YOU, GINA?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.785
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.623
DID SOMETHING ELSE
HAPPEN THIS WEEK?

19:18.891 --> 19:19.859
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.794
DID YOU MEET SOMEONE?

19:23.396 --> 19:24.897
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.466
I DON'T KNOW.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.205
I DID HAVE A CONVERSATION
THIS WEEK

19:32.305 --> 19:35.775
WHILE I WAS WAITING
FOR A COFFEE.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.978
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE SUBWAY

19:39.078 --> 19:43.950
AND SHE WAS
ON HER WAY TO THE GYM.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.619
AND WHAT DID YOU
TALK ABOUT?

19:46.719 --> 19:48.655
I TOLD HER SHE LOOKED
LIKE A RUNNER.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.592
SHE SAID THAT WAS
THE BEST PART ABOUT RUNNING.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.594
AND I SAID--

19:54.694 --> 19:57.230
DO YOU KNOW THIS BOOK,
"THE MEMORY OF RUNNING"?

19:57.330 --> 20:00.333
- I DON'T KNOW IT.
- NEITHER DID SHE,

20:00.433 --> 20:04.070
BUT IT WAS JUST GREAT

20:04.170 --> 20:06.839
TO STAND THERE
AND JUST TALK TO HER

20:06.939 --> 20:09.509
ABOUT A BOOK, YOU KNOW?

20:11.478 --> 20:14.481
I GOT SO EXCITED,
I RUINED IT FOR HER.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.115
I TOLD HER
THE WHOLE STORY.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.216
WHAT'S THE BOOK ABOUT?

20:17.317 --> 20:18.651
IT'S ABOUT REDEMPTION,

20:18.751 --> 20:21.921
I SUPPOSE.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.891
AND DID YOU MAKE A PLAN
TO SEE THIS WOMAN AGAIN?

20:24.991 --> 20:27.660
HER NAME IS WENDY.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.196
WE LIVE
ON THE SAME BLOCK.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.866
I'M SURE WE'LL "RUN" INTO
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.569
( chuckles )

20:39.739 --> 20:41.641
AND YOU?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.075
ME WHAT?

20:43.175 --> 20:45.612
DO YOU HAVE
A DATE TONIGHT?

20:45.712 --> 20:48.247
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE
WEARING THAT DRESS?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.216
I DO.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.419
I KNEW IT.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.622
SO WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

20:58.291 --> 21:00.259
RIGHT.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.261
BOUNDARIES

21:02.362 --> 21:04.664
UNTIL THE BITTER END.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.501
YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT
THERAPIST, GINA.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.604
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
SURVIVED WITHOUT YOU.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.408
THANK YOU.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.985
( sighs ) UM...

21:26.085 --> 21:27.454
YEAH?

21:27.554 --> 21:30.590
PAUL, THIS IS THE POINT
WHERE, YOU KNOW,

21:30.690 --> 21:34.561
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY
"MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN,"

21:34.661 --> 21:36.929
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY THAT.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.368
I UNDERSTAND.

21:49.442 --> 21:54.080
SO OUR TIME IS UP.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.716
GOOD LUCK.

22:08.027 --> 22:11.564
( door opens, closes )

22:22.308 --> 22:25.545
( music playing )
