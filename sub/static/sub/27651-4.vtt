00:14.925 --> 00:16.885
Bhaji? No worries,

00:16.925 --> 00:19.565
[Fred]<i> Many of us</i>

00:19.605 --> 00:22.005
Duck wrap? Yep.

00:19.605 --> 00:22.005
Hot one? Yep.

00:22.045 --> 00:25.485

Thank you.

00:26.605 --> 00:28.845
There's nothing

00:26.605 --> 00:28.845
like this out there.

00:28.885 --> 00:31.365
We left our jobs

00:28.885 --> 00:31.365
to follow our dream.

00:31.405 --> 00:33.845
I want to be

00:31.405 --> 00:33.845

00:33.885 --> 00:34.885
[Fred]<i> It's such</i>

00:43.765 --> 00:45.405
Over the next six weeks,

00:45.445 --> 00:48.725
I'll be looking

00:45.445 --> 00:48.725

00:50.925 --> 00:54.365

01:08.925 --> 01:11.525
I like businesses where

really great.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.165
We need a pork belly...

01:16.205 --> 01:17.845
It is tough out there,

01:17.885 --> 01:19.845

01:22.725 --> 01:25.525
If the business plan is right,

01:22.725 --> 01:25.525
I'll fight to invest.

01:27.165 --> 01:29.325
[Fred]<i> The entrepreneurs</i>

That's a £400,000 pork chop.

01:42.805 --> 01:46.205
When the kitchen closes,

01:42.805 --> 01:46.205
will the investors

01:42.805 --> 01:46.205
make them an offer?

01:46.245 --> 01:47.805
This is the most

01:46.245 --> 01:47.805
nervous wait of my life.

01:47.845 --> 01:50.605

And the latest trend

02:19.005 --> 02:22.725

it's not just about return.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.045
It's all about

02:45.565 --> 02:47.045
the provenance of the food.

02:47.085 --> 02:48.365
You know,

02:47.085 --> 02:48.365

<i>Sustainability should</i>

respected investors

04:12.165 --> 04:14.525

04:14.565 --> 04:17.285
Only one of you is going

04:17.325 --> 04:18.925

04:18.965 --> 04:21.125

[Fred]<i> These investors</i>

04:30.885 --> 04:34.125
<i>But they back just a handful</i>

04:30.885 --> 04:34.125
<i>of start-ups each year.</i>

04:34.165 --> 04:36.605
All these ideas believe

04:34.165 --> 04:36.605
that sustainability

04:36.645 --> 04:37.885
is the way of the future.

04:37.925 --> 04:39.725
What do you think

04:37.925 --> 04:39.725
of this sector?

04:39.765 --> 04:43.845
I'm a vegetarian myself,

04:39.765 --> 04:43.845
so many of these menus

04:39.765 --> 04:43.845
really appeal to me.

04:43.885 --> 04:45.765
But in terms of investment,

04:43.885 --> 04:45.765
this is an area

04:45.805 --> 04:47.085
that's come under

04:45.805 --> 04:47.085
increasing focus.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.325
I'm Shruti Ajitsaria.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.325
I'm a lawyer by day,

04:50.365 --> 04:52.565
but for the last six years,

04:50.365 --> 04:52.565
my husband and I

04:52.605 --> 04:54.685
<i>have invested in about</i>

04:52.605 --> 04:54.685
<i>30 businesses.</i>

04:54.725 --> 04:58.085
Millennials are really

04:54.725 --> 04:58.085
the sector that I've got

04:54.725 --> 04:58.085
my eye on.

04:58.125 --> 05:02.045
<i>More and more</i>

04:58.125 --> 05:02.045
<i>they're looking to</i>

04:58.125 --> 05:02.045
<i>where the origins of food are,</i>

05:02.085 --> 05:03.925
and they are the people

05:02.085 --> 05:03.925
who have got

05:02.085 --> 05:03.925
the spending power,

05:03.965 --> 05:06.805
and the people who genuinely

05:03.965 --> 05:06.805
make a business investable.

05:06.845 --> 05:10.205
It's all well and good,

05:06.845 --> 05:10.205
you know, to talk about

05:06.845 --> 05:10.205
sustainability.

05:10.245 --> 05:12.925
But at the end of the day,

05:10.245 --> 05:12.925
the financials have

05:10.245 --> 05:12.925
to stack up, Darrel.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.285
Fred, the bottom line is,

05:14.325 --> 05:16.405
I don't want to invest

05:14.325 --> 05:16.405
in a business that goes bust.

05:16.445 --> 05:18.805
You'll get the consumer there

05:16.445 --> 05:18.805
by your sustainability story,

05:18.845 --> 05:20.365
but ultimately the product's

05:18.845 --> 05:20.365
got to be very good,

05:20.405 --> 05:21.805
to bring the customer back

05:21.845 --> 05:24.805
so you have a sustainable

05:21.845 --> 05:24.805
business that will last.

05:55.245 --> 05:58.765

<i>British produce</i>

05:55.245 --> 05:58.765
<i>with a Nordic twist.</i>

06:00.405 --> 06:02.285
We tend to use a lot

06:00.405 --> 06:02.285
of Scandinavian techniques,

06:02.325 --> 06:05.485
like pickling, curing

06:02.325 --> 06:05.485
and smoking.

06:05.525 --> 06:07.645

a Norwegian great granddad.

06:12.445 --> 06:14.365
It's true, that.

06:12.445 --> 06:14.365

06:40.725 --> 06:43.605
So, today we're making

06:40.725 --> 06:43.605
a semi-cured cod loin

06:43.645 --> 06:45.565
with hasselback chips.

[Fred]<i> Hasselback chips</i>

06:55.005 --> 06:56.925

Do you think these guys

06:56.965 --> 06:59.205
have got what it takes?

06:59.245 --> 07:02.325
I think that it's a really

06:59.245 --> 07:02.325
exciting emerging food scene.

07:02.365 --> 07:06.165
I like the pickling,

07:02.365 --> 07:06.165
the curing,

07:02.365 --> 07:06.165
the healthy element.

07:06.205 --> 07:07.645
My name

07:06.205 --> 07:07.645
is Laura Harper-Hinton.

07:17.045 --> 07:20.285
passion and purpose

07:20.325 --> 07:22.165
Maria, you are Swedish--

07:22.205 --> 07:24.565
I'm Swedish-Estonian

07:22.205 --> 07:24.565
so I'm very Nordic.

07:24.605 --> 07:26.725
I mean, it's something

07:24.605 --> 07:26.725
that appeals to me,

07:26.765 --> 07:31.085
and I think it's a very

07:26.765 --> 07:31.085
sustainable way

07:26.765 --> 07:31.085
of eating and living.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.525

<i>My background</i>

07:32.565 --> 07:35.405

07:35.445 --> 07:36.845

07:36.885 --> 07:38.605
<i>investing</i>

07:36.885 --> 07:38.605
<i>into different projects.</i>

07:38.645 --> 07:40.845
Consumerism is changing

07:38.645 --> 07:40.845
quite a lot,

07:40.885 --> 07:45.525
and I think this is a trend

07:40.885 --> 07:45.525
that you really have

07:40.885 --> 07:45.525
to embrace.

07:45.565 --> 07:49.205
My heart is beating

07:45.565 --> 07:49.205
quite fast at the moment,

07:45.565 --> 07:49.205
to be honest with you.

07:49.245 --> 07:51.445
[Fred]<i> If they're chosen</i>

07:49.245 --> 07:51.445

07:51.485 --> 07:53.525
[Dan] Okay, sound.

07:53.565 --> 07:58.805
<i>...Skaus will be asking</i>

07:53.565 --> 07:58.805
<i>an investor to back them</i>

07:53.565 --> 07:58.805
<i>with £210,000.</i>

08:00.485 --> 08:01.765
Right, I think the boys

08:00.485 --> 08:01.765
from Skaus

08:01.805 --> 08:03.525
are just behind

08:01.805 --> 08:03.525
the door there.

08:01.805 --> 08:03.525
Let me get them.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.245
-[Shruti] Hello.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.245
-Hello. Very nice

08:07.965 --> 08:09.245
to meet you.

08:09.285 --> 08:12.085
-Very nice to meet you.

08:09.285 --> 08:12.085
Thank you.

08:09.285 --> 08:12.085
-Here you go.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.845
[Darrel] So, what have

08:12.125 --> 08:13.845
we got here then?

08:13.885 --> 08:17.525
Okay, guys, so we've

08:13.885 --> 08:17.525
got a semi-cured cod loin,

08:13.885 --> 08:17.525
with pickled fennel,

08:17.565 --> 08:18.965
hasselback chips

08:17.565 --> 08:18.965
and smoked hollandaise.

08:19.005 --> 08:20.325
[Fred] Let's eat.

08:20.365 --> 08:21.445
-[Darrel] Thank you

08:20.365 --> 08:21.445
very much.

08:20.365 --> 08:21.445
-[Laura] Thank you.

08:37.005 --> 08:38.365
What do you think

08:37.005 --> 08:38.365
about the food?

08:38.405 --> 08:40.525
I've never had

08:38.405 --> 08:40.525
hasselback chips before.

08:40.565 --> 08:43.325
They are incredible. I mean,

08:40.565 --> 08:43.325
I've been missing these

08:40.565 --> 08:43.325
all my life.

08:43.365 --> 08:45.605
They are amazing.

08:43.365 --> 08:45.605
They are so tasty.

08:45.645 --> 08:46.845
They are very good.

08:46.885 --> 08:49.125
Maria, what is your

08:46.885 --> 08:49.125
feedback for the boys?

08:49.165 --> 08:52.805
Cod is what we grew up on,

08:49.165 --> 08:52.805
so just that is really good.

08:53.525 --> 08:54.485
Thank you very much.

08:54.525 --> 08:55.845
That means a lot

08:54.525 --> 08:55.845
from a Scandinavian.

08:57.205 --> 08:58.685
If you look

08:57.205 --> 08:58.685
at your presentation,

08:58.725 --> 09:00.845
it is very focused

08:58.725 --> 09:00.845
on Scandinavian food,

09:00.885 --> 09:03.245
but if you look

09:00.885 --> 09:03.245
at your menu,

09:03.285 --> 09:05.205
it's lots of burgers

09:03.285 --> 09:05.205
and things like that.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.445
Would you consider going

09:05.245 --> 09:07.445
very Scandinavian?

09:07.485 --> 09:10.245
So, when we do do a burger,

09:07.485 --> 09:10.245
there's a lot of pickles,

09:10.285 --> 09:11.645
and we keep it super Scandi.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.685
And it'll be served

09:11.685 --> 09:13.685
with the hasselback chips.

09:13.725 --> 09:15.565
So, we've taken

09:13.725 --> 09:15.565
our twist on it.

09:15.605 --> 09:17.205
But it's so important,

09:15.605 --> 09:17.205
we don't want to scare people.

09:17.245 --> 09:19.205
[Dan] Yeah,

09:17.245 --> 09:19.205
Scandinavian food,

09:17.245 --> 09:19.205
it's quite new.

09:19.245 --> 09:20.965
So, it's a bit

09:19.245 --> 09:20.965
of a slow process

09:19.245 --> 09:20.965
to get people in

09:21.005 --> 09:22.605
and get them

09:21.005 --> 09:22.605
trying the food.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.685
Well, listening to you

09:22.645 --> 09:24.685
both speak it sounds

09:22.645 --> 09:24.685
incredibly exciting.

09:24.725 --> 09:27.245
But I do think that

09:24.725 --> 09:27.245
you are going to struggle

09:27.285 --> 09:30.285
marrying the Nordic flavors

09:30.325 --> 09:33.245
with the sort of

09:30.325 --> 09:33.245
more accessible style

09:30.325 --> 09:33.245
of your food.

09:33.285 --> 09:35.285
And I think that would need

09:33.285 --> 09:35.285
a bit more work.

09:35.965 --> 09:37.005
[Darrel] Thanks, guys.

09:37.045 --> 09:37.925
-Thank you very much.

09:37.045 --> 09:37.925
-[all] Thank you.

09:40.605 --> 09:44.325
My stomach's in knots.

09:40.605 --> 09:44.325
I've never felt

09:40.605 --> 09:44.325
adrenaline like it.

09:44.365 --> 09:46.045
It's intense,

09:44.365 --> 09:46.045
it's really intense, yeah.

09:47.845 --> 09:49.885
Hello, what can I get you?

11:04.445 --> 11:06.645

11:04.445 --> 11:06.645

11:06.685 --> 11:08.645
is there's a lot

11:22.965 --> 11:25.125
But £1 million

11:22.965 --> 11:25.125

11:25.165 --> 11:27.365

11:51.605 --> 11:53.725
So, in front of you

11:51.605 --> 11:53.725
you have a Peshawari korma,

11:53.765 --> 11:57.045
with roasted cauliflower

11:53.765 --> 11:57.045
and preserved lemon grains

11:53.765 --> 11:57.045
underneath.

12:02.725 --> 12:05.605
Tanya, it's delicious

12:02.725 --> 12:05.605
and Shruti can't stop eating!

12:05.645 --> 12:06.565
[laughs]

12:06.605 --> 12:08.165
I'm from Indian heritage

12:06.605 --> 12:08.165
myself,

12:08.205 --> 12:09.685
grown up on Indian food.

12:09.725 --> 12:11.645
And my mother will kill me

12:09.725 --> 12:11.645
for saying this,

12:11.685 --> 12:13.325
but I have never had

12:11.685 --> 12:13.325
anything quite like it.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.485
Oh, wow.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.365
[Laura] There's crunch

12:14.525 --> 12:16.365
as well as softness,

12:16.405 --> 12:18.085
and the textures

12:16.405 --> 12:18.085
are fantastic,

12:18.125 --> 12:19.885
so, yeah, absolute winner

12:18.125 --> 12:19.885
of a dish for me.

12:19.925 --> 12:22.445
Thank you, that's very kind.

12:19.925 --> 12:22.445
Thank you very much.

12:22.485 --> 12:23.965
[Darrel] Tanya,

12:22.485 --> 12:23.965
from your business plan

12:24.005 --> 12:26.565
-you're looking to open

12:24.005 --> 12:26.565
in the West End of London.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.565
-Yep.

12:26.605 --> 12:28.725
The sort of quantum of

12:26.605 --> 12:28.725
money you're looking for,

12:26.605 --> 12:28.725
of £1 million,

12:28.765 --> 12:32.445
to go in the most

12:28.765 --> 12:32.445
competitive patch in Europe,

12:28.765 --> 12:32.445
if not the world.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.925
Should you be moving

12:32.485 --> 12:33.925
forward to Manchester,

12:33.965 --> 12:35.205
I would really

12:33.965 --> 12:35.205
want to get into

12:35.245 --> 12:37.045
how that money's going

12:35.245 --> 12:37.045
to be deployed, and spent,

12:37.085 --> 12:39.005
and the returns

12:37.085 --> 12:39.005
and the financials around it.

12:39.045 --> 12:43.165
The vegan, plant-based

12:39.045 --> 12:43.165
vegetarian movement

12:39.045 --> 12:43.165
is rapidly growing.

12:43.205 --> 12:46.845
So, I want to take

12:43.205 --> 12:46.845
plant-based food out of

12:46.885 --> 12:48.565
the idea of it

12:46.885 --> 12:48.565
being marginal,

12:48.605 --> 12:51.525
that's why I'm looking for

12:48.605 --> 12:51.525
a really central location.

12:51.565 --> 12:53.685
-But they're big rents,

12:51.565 --> 12:53.685
you know?

12:51.565 --> 12:53.685
-Yeah.

12:53.725 --> 12:55.045
You need to do big numbers.

12:55.085 --> 12:56.445
I wanna shout about

12:55.085 --> 12:56.445
all these brilliant things

12:56.485 --> 12:57.965
that I'm talking

12:56.485 --> 12:57.965
about today

12:58.005 --> 13:01.085
and that's why

12:58.005 --> 13:01.085
a central location

12:58.005 --> 13:01.085
would be ideal.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.685
But I'm, you know...

13:01.125 --> 13:03.685
I'm open to suggestions.

13:06.165 --> 13:09.165
<i>It was all right, actually.</i>

13:06.165 --> 13:09.165
<i>I tried my best.</i>

13:09.205 --> 13:11.645
Really happy with what

13:09.205 --> 13:11.645
they said about the food...

13:12.925 --> 13:13.765
Score.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.885
[Sadhbh] This is some

13:16.125 --> 13:18.885
lemon verbena.

13:18.925 --> 13:21.605
[Fred]<i> The last team</i>

[Sadhbh]

13:23.965 --> 13:27.085

13:23.965 --> 13:27.085

13:27.125 --> 13:29.885
[Fred]<i> A supper club serving</i>

13:27.125 --> 13:29.885

<i>an environmental consultant</i>

13:37.805 --> 13:40.885
<i>and chef.</i>

13:40.925 --> 13:45.005
It started when Sadhbh and I

13:40.925 --> 13:45.005
met at a waste food project.

13:45.045 --> 13:47.005
[Sadhbh]<i> We shared</i>

13:45.045 --> 13:47.005
<i>a common interest</i>

13:47.045 --> 13:48.725
in collecting

13:47.045 --> 13:48.725
interesting ingredients

13:48.765 --> 13:50.645
we wanted to cook

13:48.765 --> 13:50.645
and share with people.

13:50.685 --> 13:52.605
<i>We wanted to start</i>

13:50.685 --> 13:52.605
<i>a supper club</i>

13:50.685 --> 13:52.605

13:52.645 --> 13:54.845
<i>who like to discuss</i>

13:52.645 --> 13:54.845
<i>all this stuff.</i>

13:54.885 --> 13:56.245
Like organic,

13:54.885 --> 13:56.245
in season or local,

13:56.285 --> 13:57.645
or what does it all mean.

13:57.685 --> 14:01.325
These are some cob nuts

13:57.685 --> 14:01.325
that we foraged in Wiltshire.

14:01.365 --> 14:04.765
So, we're actually asking

14:01.365 --> 14:04.765
for investment to buy a barge

14:04.805 --> 14:08.525
<i>and then convert it</i>

14:04.805 --> 14:08.525
<i>into a cafe. Which is like...</i>

14:08.565 --> 14:10.805
<i>We make kind of</i>

14:08.565 --> 14:10.805
<i>good tarts, open sandwiches,</i>

14:10.845 --> 14:12.805
good cake, really nice coffee.

14:12.845 --> 14:15.565
It's nothing super,

14:12.845 --> 14:15.565
super fancy, is it?

14:15.605 --> 14:18.085
But we could definitely do

14:15.605 --> 14:18.085
supper clubs in the space,

14:15.605 --> 14:18.085
do it more formal.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.005
That's what we currently do.

14:20.045 --> 14:22.485
[Fred]<i> They plan</i>

14:20.045 --> 14:22.485
<i>to create extra revenue</i>

14:22.525 --> 14:26.485
<i>by catering for events</i>

14:22.525 --> 14:26.485
<i>and running workshops</i>

14:26.525 --> 14:29.205
[Sadhbh]<i> It's really important</i>

14:26.525 --> 14:29.205
<i>we get investment now</i>

14:29.245 --> 14:31.685
because sustainable food

14:29.245 --> 14:31.685
and looking into

14:29.245 --> 14:31.685
sustainable food

14:31.725 --> 14:33.045
is really on the rise.

14:33.085 --> 14:34.765
<i>And, I think, we have</i>

14:33.085 --> 14:34.765
<i>a lot of expertise</i>

14:34.805 --> 14:37.365
and we want to be

14:34.805 --> 14:37.365
at the cusp of this.

14:37.405 --> 14:41.365
It's rustic, it's lunch-y.

14:37.405 --> 14:41.365
It's exactly what we planned.

14:41.405 --> 14:44.445
[Fred]<i> Abi and Sadhbh believe</i>

14:41.405 --> 14:44.445
<i>their wholesome tarts</i>

14:44.485 --> 14:48.205

<i>for the new generation</i>

14:44.485 --> 14:48.205
<i>of ethical diners.</i>

14:50.285 --> 14:51.765
You can see that

14:50.285 --> 14:51.765
they are really passionate,

14:51.805 --> 14:53.565
and quite quirky

14:51.805 --> 14:53.565
and interesting people,

14:53.605 --> 14:55.085
which really excites me.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.005
There's a lot going on

14:55.125 --> 14:57.005
in what they're trying

14:55.125 --> 14:57.005
to achieve.

14:57.045 --> 14:58.965
So, they've got a cafe,

14:57.045 --> 14:58.965
they want to do events,

14:59.005 --> 15:01.365
they want to educate,

14:59.005 --> 15:01.365
they want to have workshops.

15:01.405 --> 15:03.405
And I just want to know

15:01.405 --> 15:03.405
how that's going to fit

15:01.405 --> 15:03.405
on a boat.

15:05.485 --> 15:07.485
Got a nice firm bottom

15:05.485 --> 15:07.485
on that tart.

15:08.525 --> 15:10.045
[Fred]<i> They want an investor</i>

15:10.085 --> 15:14.885

15:10.085 --> 15:14.885

15:10.085 --> 15:14.885
<i>with £300,000.</i>

15:14.925 --> 15:16.805
-Hi.

15:14.925 --> 15:16.805
-Come through, girls.

15:16.845 --> 15:17.925
Oh, wow, thank you.

15:18.765 --> 15:20.085
It's so colorful.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.365
[Darrel] Wow.

15:21.405 --> 15:22.365
[Fred] Let's eat.

15:25.685 --> 15:29.325
So, we've got

15:25.685 --> 15:29.325
a heritage grain beetroot

15:25.685 --> 15:29.325
and goats' cheese tart.

15:29.365 --> 15:30.805
[Sadhbh] They're all

15:29.365 --> 15:30.805
home-milled grains.

15:30.845 --> 15:33.805
And we made it

15:30.845 --> 15:33.805
with goats' butter

15:30.845 --> 15:33.805
and ewes' milk,

15:33.845 --> 15:35.605
so there is no

15:33.845 --> 15:35.605
cow product in this.

15:35.645 --> 15:38.325
We don't do

15:35.645 --> 15:38.325
strictly vegan food,

15:38.365 --> 15:39.645
but we really think

15:38.365 --> 15:39.645
about the sustainability,

15:39.685 --> 15:42.325
so we try to use

15:39.685 --> 15:42.325
less cow dairy.

15:42.365 --> 15:44.285
Wow, there's so much

15:42.365 --> 15:44.285
in that plate!

15:44.325 --> 15:45.525
[laughs]

15:45.565 --> 15:47.725
[Laura] I mean, it looks

15:45.565 --> 15:47.725
and feels good for you.

15:47.765 --> 15:50.725
Which is what I love.

15:47.765 --> 15:50.725
But it's really got

15:47.765 --> 15:50.725
some great punchy flavors.

15:50.765 --> 15:52.725
I can taste

15:50.765 --> 15:52.725
the smoked sesame oil,

15:52.765 --> 15:55.165
that is really the star

15:52.765 --> 15:55.165
of the show on the slaw.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.645
For me, the thing that

15:55.205 --> 15:57.645
I don't understand,

15:57.685 --> 16:00.645
cutting straight

15:57.685 --> 16:00.645
to the chase, is the barge.

16:00.685 --> 16:02.565
So, we did quite a lot

16:00.685 --> 16:02.565
of market research

16:02.605 --> 16:04.685
and there are restaurants

16:02.605 --> 16:04.685
that are built on barges.

16:04.725 --> 16:06.405
And I think that

16:04.725 --> 16:06.405
understanding

16:04.725 --> 16:06.405
the millennial market

16:06.445 --> 16:08.365
and knowing our

16:06.445 --> 16:08.365
insatiable desire for novelty.

16:08.405 --> 16:10.645
On a barge, I think

16:08.405 --> 16:10.645
it's really achievable.

16:10.685 --> 16:11.845
Shruti?

16:11.885 --> 16:13.645
I feel, when I looked

16:11.885 --> 16:13.645
at your business plan,

16:13.685 --> 16:15.605
that there was a bit

16:13.685 --> 16:15.605
of over-enthusiasm almost.

16:15.645 --> 16:16.805
And there's quite

16:15.645 --> 16:16.805
a lot going on.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.365
How realistic do you

16:16.845 --> 16:19.365
think that all is?

16:19.405 --> 16:21.965
The cafe is, like

16:19.405 --> 16:21.965
the public facing side

16:22.005 --> 16:23.405
where you can have

16:22.005 --> 16:23.405
people come in,

16:23.445 --> 16:25.525
but I think we would

16:23.445 --> 16:25.525
do more events.

16:25.565 --> 16:27.165
We do some

16:25.565 --> 16:27.165
big catering events,

16:27.205 --> 16:29.725
so we can cater for,

16:27.205 --> 16:29.725
like, ten and quite intimate,

16:29.765 --> 16:30.885
or we can do 300.

16:30.925 --> 16:32.165
Three hundred?

16:32.205 --> 16:34.205
We did the Oxford...

16:32.205 --> 16:34.205
We were asked in the summer,

16:34.245 --> 16:35.685
we collaborated

16:34.245 --> 16:35.685
with Borough Market

16:35.725 --> 16:38.085
and we catered

16:35.725 --> 16:38.085
the Oxford Symposium

16:35.725 --> 16:38.085
on Food and Cooking.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.365
Yeah, you learn what you

16:38.125 --> 16:40.365
can do for 300 and--

16:40.405 --> 16:42.125
-What's scalable, yeah.

16:40.405 --> 16:42.125
-Exactly.

16:42.165 --> 16:43.965
Thank you very much,

16:42.165 --> 16:43.965
it was delicious. Thank you.

16:44.005 --> 16:46.165
[Sadhbh]<i> I think we gave it</i>

16:44.005 --> 16:46.165
<i>our best shot. I feel</i>

16:44.005 --> 16:46.165
<i>pretty proud of us.</i>

16:46.205 --> 16:47.525
Yeah, yeah.

16:47.565 --> 16:48.605
And you.

16:52.685 --> 16:55.805
Right, this is it.

16:52.685 --> 16:55.805
I mean, we've had

16:52.685 --> 16:55.805
three very strong ideas.

16:55.845 --> 16:57.285
Now is the time

16:55.845 --> 16:57.285
to make a decision.

16:57.325 --> 16:59.645
You know, who is going

16:57.325 --> 16:59.645
to Manchester to run

16:57.325 --> 16:59.645
the pop-up?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.805
[Fred]<i> The idea</i>

<i>with the most</i>

16:59.685 --> 17:01.805

<i>will be chosen</i>

17:09.405 --> 17:10.605
[Darrel] The guys

17:09.405 --> 17:10.605
come across very well.

17:10.645 --> 17:12.165
<i>They seem to know</i>

17:10.645 --> 17:12.165
<i>what they're doing.</i>

17:12.205 --> 17:14.605
The fact that they're

17:12.205 --> 17:14.605
operating at the moment,

17:12.205 --> 17:14.605
they're trading.

17:14.645 --> 17:16.045
You know,

17:14.645 --> 17:16.045
that's very compelling.

17:16.085 --> 17:18.845
I worry a little bit about

17:16.085 --> 17:18.845
exactly what their concept is

17:18.885 --> 17:21.205
<i>as far as delivering this,</i>

17:18.885 --> 17:21.205
<i>you know,</i>

17:21.245 --> 17:22.725
<i>Scandinavian aspiration.</i>

17:22.765 --> 17:25.245
<i>Is that Scandinavian,</i>

17:22.765 --> 17:25.245
<i>what they've done</i>

17:22.765 --> 17:25.245
<i>to their food?</i>

17:25.285 --> 17:27.045
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

17:27.085 --> 17:28.605
Definitely think I could've

17:27.085 --> 17:28.605
been more eloquent

17:28.645 --> 17:30.405
when I was describing things.

17:30.445 --> 17:31.885
[Fred] What about Devi's?

17:31.925 --> 17:34.405
[Darrel]<i> Her food</i>

17:31.925 --> 17:34.405
<i>was the nicest food</i>

17:31.925 --> 17:34.405
<i>we had all day.</i>

17:34.445 --> 17:36.125
<i>I thought it was</i>

17:34.445 --> 17:36.125
<i>absolutely delicious.</i>

17:36.165 --> 17:40.085
But to open a £1 million site

17:36.165 --> 17:40.085
in the heart of London,

17:40.125 --> 17:43.005
with no business experience,

17:40.125 --> 17:43.005
no commercial experience,

17:43.045 --> 17:45.005
that's a big, big, big ask.

17:45.045 --> 17:46.885
I liked the fact

17:45.045 --> 17:46.885
that she was ambitious

17:46.925 --> 17:48.965
and that she has bold vision

17:49.005 --> 17:50.365
for where she wants

17:49.005 --> 17:50.365
to get to eventually.

17:50.405 --> 17:51.765
And I quite admire that.

17:51.805 --> 17:55.165
I think it went okay

17:51.805 --> 17:55.165
but they're so, like,

17:51.805 --> 17:55.165
dead pan.

17:55.205 --> 17:57.045
No idea what

17:55.205 --> 17:57.045
they're really thinking.

17:57.085 --> 17:59.925
And our last concept,

17:57.085 --> 17:59.925
The Sustainable Food Story,

17:57.085 --> 17:59.925
now?

17:59.965 --> 18:01.285
That's the way

17:59.965 --> 18:01.285
the market's going.

18:01.325 --> 18:03.205
People no longer want to go

18:01.325 --> 18:03.205
and sit and have a meal.

18:03.245 --> 18:04.725
<i>They want to be part</i>

18:03.245 --> 18:04.725
<i>of something.</i>

18:04.765 --> 18:07.165
<i>Feel that</i>

18:04.765 --> 18:07.165
<i>there's an experience</i>

18:04.765 --> 18:07.165
<i>wrapped around it.</i>

18:07.205 --> 18:08.965
And I think there's a really

18:07.205 --> 18:08.965
experiential element

18:09.005 --> 18:10.485
to this business,

18:09.005 --> 18:10.485
which is quite exciting.

18:10.525 --> 18:12.765
I honestly think that

18:10.525 --> 18:12.765
they would struggle

18:12.805 --> 18:15.845
<i>to find a loyal</i>

18:12.805 --> 18:15.845
<i>customer base.</i>

18:15.885 --> 18:18.765
Because they are niche

18:15.885 --> 18:18.765
upon niche upon niche.

18:18.805 --> 18:20.725
The collective knowledge

18:18.805 --> 18:20.725
in that room was incredible.

18:20.765 --> 18:22.565
Like, wow, you all

18:20.765 --> 18:22.565
know a lot more

18:22.605 --> 18:24.645
-than I do about

18:22.605 --> 18:24.645
running businesses.

18:22.605 --> 18:24.645
-Yeah.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.805
[Fred] I think that

18:24.685 --> 18:26.805
we're going to have

18:24.685 --> 18:26.805
to make a decision.

18:26.845 --> 18:29.205
Who are the people

18:26.845 --> 18:29.205
that you want to invest in?

18:31.725 --> 18:35.005
<i>Someone is about</i>

18:31.725 --> 18:35.005
<i>to be a step closer</i>

18:35.045 --> 18:36.645
<i>to the dream</i>

18:35.045 --> 18:36.645
<i>of their own restaurant.</i>

18:36.685 --> 18:37.685
How are you, guys?

18:37.725 --> 18:39.925
-[all] Good.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.925
-Yeah.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.285
-A little nervous.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.285
-Tentative.

18:41.325 --> 18:42.685
Well, look, you've done

18:41.325 --> 18:42.685
very, very well.

18:42.725 --> 18:44.605
They have made a decision.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.725
The idea that, for them,

18:45.765 --> 18:48.765
has the most investment

18:45.765 --> 18:48.765
potential is...

18:51.045 --> 18:52.165
Tanya.

18:52.205 --> 18:53.165
Well done.

18:57.365 --> 18:58.245
Tanya, well done.

18:58.285 --> 18:59.965
Thank you.

19:00.005 --> 19:03.325
Shall I tell you

19:00.005 --> 19:03.325
which investors

19:00.005 --> 19:03.325
are going to Manchester?

19:03.365 --> 19:04.645
Oh, yeah.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.405
-We've got

19:04.685 --> 19:07.405
Laura Harper-Hinton...

19:04.685 --> 19:07.405
-Okay.

19:07.445 --> 19:08.605
And Shruti Ajitsaria.

19:08.645 --> 19:10.365
[Tanya] Oh, wonderful.

19:10.405 --> 19:13.125
I thought that Devi's food

19:10.405 --> 19:13.125
was delicious.

19:13.165 --> 19:15.325
<i>She was very credible</i>

19:13.165 --> 19:15.325
<i>and I'm really excited</i>

19:15.365 --> 19:16.845
<i>to go and see her</i>

19:15.365 --> 19:16.845
<i>in Manchester.</i>

19:16.885 --> 19:18.525
<i>One of the things</i>

19:16.885 --> 19:18.525
<i>I'm really interested</i>

19:18.565 --> 19:21.325
to find out more about

19:18.565 --> 19:21.325
is Tanya's background

19:18.565 --> 19:21.325
and her experience.

19:21.365 --> 19:23.525
Because it's a big ask,

19:21.365 --> 19:23.525
£1 million

19:23.565 --> 19:25.645
and I'm not sure that

19:23.565 --> 19:25.645
she would really know

19:25.685 --> 19:27.445
how to spend that wisely.

19:27.485 --> 19:30.045
[Laura]<i> There is no question</i>

19:27.485 --> 19:30.045
<i>about Tanya's passion.</i>

19:30.085 --> 19:31.685
What I need to see from her

19:31.725 --> 19:34.965
is that she can back it up

19:31.725 --> 19:34.965
with real business skill

19:31.725 --> 19:34.965
and nail this.

19:35.005 --> 19:37.885
[Tanya]<i> I would have been</i>

19:35.005 --> 19:37.885
<i>happy from what they said</i>

19:35.005 --> 19:37.885
<i>about the food.</i>

19:37.925 --> 19:39.605
That was just enough

19:37.925 --> 19:39.605
of a pat on the back.

19:39.645 --> 19:45.365
But to be the one chosen

19:39.645 --> 19:45.365
to go on to the next stage

19:39.645 --> 19:45.365
is crazy.

19:45.405 --> 19:48.925
[Fred]<i> But for two</i>

19:45.405 --> 19:48.925
<i>of the investors</i>

19:45.405 --> 19:48.925
<i>it's the end of the road.</i>

19:48.965 --> 19:52.205
Tanya for Devi's

19:48.965 --> 19:52.205
was looking for £1 million

19:48.965 --> 19:52.205
worth of investment

19:52.245 --> 19:55.125
to open her first restaurant

19:52.245 --> 19:55.125
without any prior restaurant

19:52.245 --> 19:55.125
experience.

19:55.165 --> 19:56.885
Despite the fact

19:55.165 --> 19:56.885
the food was delicious,

19:56.925 --> 19:59.765
<i>I struggle to want to move</i>

19:56.925 --> 19:59.765
<i>forward with Devi's.</i>

19:59.805 --> 20:02.205
[Maria]<i> I think Devi's</i>

19:59.805 --> 20:02.205
<i>was great</i>

20:02.245 --> 20:05.045
but needed maybe

20:02.245 --> 20:05.045
a bit more experience.

20:05.085 --> 20:08.365
And so, I will not be

20:05.085 --> 20:08.365
going to Manchester.

20:08.405 --> 20:11.285
You know, the investors

20:08.405 --> 20:11.285
have concerns

20:11.325 --> 20:14.165
-about your ability

20:11.325 --> 20:14.165
to handle £1 million.

20:11.325 --> 20:14.165
-Sure.

20:14.205 --> 20:16.485
So, are you flexible

20:14.205 --> 20:16.485
with the amount of money?

20:16.525 --> 20:19.245
Yeah, I'm really willing

20:16.525 --> 20:19.245
to explore what they offer me,

20:19.285 --> 20:20.725
if they offer me anything.

20:20.765 --> 20:22.765
You know, what you

20:20.765 --> 20:22.765
served us was so good.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.685
-Yeah.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.685
-You cannot go below that.

20:24.725 --> 20:27.885
And I like meat,

20:24.725 --> 20:27.885
and I could eat that

20:24.725 --> 20:27.885
every day. Any day.

20:27.925 --> 20:29.005
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

20:29.045 --> 20:30.725
All right, listen,

20:29.045 --> 20:30.725
see you in Manchester.

20:30.765 --> 20:32.125
-See you in Manchester.

20:30.765 --> 20:32.125
-Break a leg.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.405
Thank you, oh, gosh.

20:33.445 --> 20:35.925
-[Fred] Not literally.

20:33.445 --> 20:35.925
-[laughs]

20:49.365 --> 20:51.485
[Fred]<i> Devi's has made it</i>

20:49.365 --> 20:51.485
<i>to Manchester.</i>

20:51.525 --> 20:54.645
Tanya has caught

20:51.525 --> 20:54.645
the attention

20:51.525 --> 20:54.645
of two investors,

20:54.685 --> 20:56.605
Laura and Shruti.

20:56.645 --> 20:58.805
<i>Now she has two days</i>

20:56.645 --> 20:58.805
<i>to convince them</i>

20:58.845 --> 20:59.845
she is worth backing.

21:03.365 --> 21:06.605
<i>Tonight, Tanya will open</i>

21:03.365 --> 21:06.605
<i>to the paying public</i>

21:06.645 --> 21:10.485

21:06.645 --> 21:10.485
<i>new restaurant for the very</i>

21:06.645 --> 21:10.485
<i>first time.</i>

21:11.325 --> 21:13.565
[Tanya] Ooh, it's lovely.

21:16.485 --> 21:19.445
[sighs] It's my restaurant.

21:19.485 --> 21:21.765
[Fred]<i> She's been working</i>

21:19.485 --> 21:21.765
<i>with a designer,</i>

21:21.805 --> 21:23.205
<i>so she can show the investors</i>

21:23.245 --> 21:26.965
<i>her vision for an upmarket</i>

21:23.245 --> 21:26.965
<i>vegetarian restaurant.</i>

21:27.005 --> 21:28.285
Very, very happy.

21:28.325 --> 21:32.165
Seeing it all in front

21:28.325 --> 21:32.165
of me is very... [sniffles]

21:32.205 --> 21:35.565
It's just really cool

21:32.205 --> 21:35.565
and I don't know.

21:35.605 --> 21:37.325
I just didn't think

21:35.605 --> 21:37.325
I'd see it.

21:38.845 --> 21:40.245
Yeah, it feels good.

21:41.645 --> 21:43.005
[laughter]

21:43.045 --> 21:46.725
[Fred]<i> 31-year-old Tanya</i>

21:43.045 --> 21:46.725

21:47.445 --> 21:48.565
Ah, thank you.

21:48.605 --> 21:50.645
[Fred]<i> Her 79-year-old</i>

21:48.605 --> 21:50.645

21:50.685 --> 21:54.605
<i>in the 1970s,</i>

21:54.645 --> 21:58.485
<i>and Tanya spent</i>

21:54.645 --> 21:58.485
<i>much of her childhood</i>

21:54.645 --> 21:58.485
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

21:58.525 --> 22:00.605
I am from an Indian family

22:00.645 --> 22:04.805
where food is very much

22:00.645 --> 22:04.805
the focal point

22:00.645 --> 22:04.805
of family life.

22:04.845 --> 22:07.605
Earliest food memories

22:04.845 --> 22:07.605
are cumin seeds

22:07.645 --> 22:09.165
fizzing from my

22:07.645 --> 22:09.165
mother's kitchen.

22:09.205 --> 22:10.125
Mum, what is in this?

22:10.165 --> 22:13.165
So, it's basically

22:10.165 --> 22:13.165
a chapati flour.

22:13.205 --> 22:14.485
My grandmother

22:14.525 --> 22:17.365
<i>embodies that whole</i>

22:14.525 --> 22:17.365
<i>East African/Indian fusion</i>

22:17.405 --> 22:18.885
<i>and then there's my aunt</i>

22:18.925 --> 22:21.765
who will throw all sorts

22:18.925 --> 22:21.765
of random things into a pot,

22:21.805 --> 22:23.445
but it always tastes amazing.

22:23.485 --> 22:26.205
<i>Those three women have</i>

22:23.485 --> 22:26.205
<i>shaped the way that I cook.</i>

22:26.245 --> 22:28.285
I am a bit of all three

22:26.245 --> 22:28.285
I think.

22:28.325 --> 22:30.445
Who's the best cook

22:28.325 --> 22:30.445
out of them two?

22:31.245 --> 22:33.445
-Me?

22:31.245 --> 22:33.445
-Oh! Really, really?

22:33.485 --> 22:35.925
-I'm sorry.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.925
-Okay, Mum, where did

22:33.485 --> 22:35.925
she learn it from?

22:35.965 --> 22:36.805
Me.

22:39.605 --> 22:42.245
Another pav bhaji

22:39.605 --> 22:42.245
and a tagine.

22:42.285 --> 22:44.525
[Fred]<i> Four years ago,</i>

22:42.285 --> 22:44.525
<i>Tanya took a gamble.</i>

22:44.565 --> 22:48.245
<i>She quit her job</i>

22:44.565 --> 22:48.245
<i>as a social worker</i>

22:44.565 --> 22:48.245
<i>and set up Devi's.</i>

22:48.285 --> 22:50.885
<i>Now she's about to take it</i>

22:48.285 --> 22:50.885
<i>to the next level.</i>

22:50.925 --> 22:53.325
[Tanya]<i> I've never run</i>

22:50.925 --> 22:53.325
<i>a restaurant before.</i>

22:53.365 --> 22:54.885
<i>And I guess</i>

22:53.365 --> 22:54.885
<i>it's just a lot more</i>

22:54.925 --> 22:57.485
intense version

22:54.925 --> 22:57.485
of what I do now.

22:57.525 --> 22:59.125
But with so much

22:57.525 --> 22:59.125
more at stake

22:59.165 --> 23:04.165
and on a much larger scale,

22:59.165 --> 23:04.165
so it is actually

22:59.165 --> 23:04.165
very terrifying.

23:05.805 --> 23:07.845
-Welcome, welcome!

23:05.805 --> 23:07.845
-Hi!

23:07.885 --> 23:11.245
[Fred]<i> 11:00 a.m.</i>

23:07.885 --> 23:11.245
<i>Six hours till Devi's opens.</i>

23:11.285 --> 23:13.125
[Tanya] How's it going?

23:11.285 --> 23:13.125
What do you think?

23:13.165 --> 23:17.125
[Fred]<i> Tanya's assembled</i>

23:13.165 --> 23:17.125
<i>a hand-picked team</i>

23:13.165 --> 23:17.125
<i>to help her win investment.</i>

23:17.165 --> 23:19.525
-It's amazing.

23:17.165 --> 23:19.525
-Ah!

23:19.565 --> 23:22.685
Let's hope we can do it

23:19.565 --> 23:22.685
some justice. I'm sure we can.

23:22.725 --> 23:24.685
[Fred]<i> There's her crew</i>

23:22.725 --> 23:24.685
<i>from her market stall,</i>

23:24.725 --> 23:26.645
<i>but otherwise</i>

23:24.725 --> 23:26.645
<i>it's a family affair.</i>

23:27.485 --> 23:29.325
<i>Her brother Raj is a lawyer.</i>

23:29.365 --> 23:32.165
<i>But tonight,</i>

23:29.365 --> 23:32.165
<i>he'll be front of house.</i>

23:32.205 --> 23:34.845
<i>Aunt Shilpa</i>

23:32.205 --> 23:34.845
<i>is a full-time carer,</i>

23:34.885 --> 23:37.205
<i>but she'll be making</i>

23:34.885 --> 23:37.205
<i>starters in Manchester.</i>

23:37.245 --> 23:39.325
[Tanya] I knew I can trust

23:37.245 --> 23:39.325
you with the bhajis.

23:39.365 --> 23:42.285
[Fred]<i> Tanya's partner, Ross,</i>

23:39.365 --> 23:42.285
<i>is a landscape gardener,</i>

23:42.325 --> 23:44.125
<i>but tonight</i>

23:42.325 --> 23:44.125
<i>he'll be a sous chef.</i>

23:44.165 --> 23:46.925
Living together,

23:44.165 --> 23:46.925
working together

23:44.165 --> 23:46.925
has its moments.

23:48.605 --> 23:52.845
Most people would say

23:48.605 --> 23:52.845
never ever mix business

23:48.605 --> 23:52.845
with family.

23:52.885 --> 23:54.925
<i>But Tanya isn't most people.</i>

23:54.965 --> 23:57.525
Crack on with as many corns

23:54.965 --> 23:57.525
as you can of 25.

23:57.565 --> 23:59.045
Please crack on

23:57.565 --> 23:59.045
with the bhajis,

23:59.085 --> 24:01.125
please crack on

23:59.085 --> 24:01.125
with your potatoes.

24:01.165 --> 24:03.525
<i>It's not easy telling</i>

24:01.165 --> 24:03.525
<i>people what to do.</i>

24:03.565 --> 24:04.765
Especially when you're

24:03.565 --> 24:04.765
related to them

24:04.805 --> 24:05.805
and they're older than you.

24:07.925 --> 24:10.565
Grab some lemon juice

24:07.925 --> 24:10.565
from the cold box.

24:10.605 --> 24:12.565
Nice and crispy

24:10.605 --> 24:12.565
on the outside,

24:10.605 --> 24:12.565
soft in the middle.

24:12.605 --> 24:14.125
Am I coming

24:12.605 --> 24:14.125
at a wrong time?

24:14.165 --> 24:15.605
Probably. But doesn't matter,

24:15.645 --> 24:17.685
we're going to work

24:15.645 --> 24:17.685
around you. Don't worry.

24:17.725 --> 24:19.365
No problem. That's fine.

24:19.405 --> 24:20.765
Cool, I just want to get

24:19.405 --> 24:20.765
everybody prepped

24:20.805 --> 24:22.245
so that they've got

24:20.805 --> 24:22.245
something to do.

24:22.285 --> 24:24.165
I've worked with some

24:22.285 --> 24:24.165
very difficult chefs

24:22.285 --> 24:24.165
in my time.

24:24.205 --> 24:26.445
Give me two minutes

24:24.205 --> 24:26.445
and I'll finish what

24:24.205 --> 24:26.445
I'm doing

24:26.485 --> 24:27.925
and then I'll be

24:26.485 --> 24:27.925
right with you.

24:27.965 --> 24:30.605
I think that's fine.

24:27.965 --> 24:30.605
So basically,

24:27.965 --> 24:30.605
two trays like this.

24:30.645 --> 24:32.205
I can see

24:30.645 --> 24:32.205
it's a female-led restaurant

24:32.245 --> 24:33.725
because I'm being

24:32.245 --> 24:33.725
bossed around

24:33.765 --> 24:35.285
as if I was in my

24:33.765 --> 24:35.285
mum's kitchen.

24:35.965 --> 24:38.325
I'm back home.

24:38.365 --> 24:41.005
-Shilpa, is your niece

24:38.365 --> 24:41.005
always this bossy?

24:38.365 --> 24:41.005
-[Shilpa] Yes.

24:41.045 --> 24:43.405
-Most of the time,

24:41.045 --> 24:43.405
yes, absolutely.

24:41.045 --> 24:43.405
-She is?

24:43.445 --> 24:45.125
[Shilpa] She is very

24:43.445 --> 24:45.125
determined, and she

24:43.445 --> 24:45.125
is very passionate.

24:45.165 --> 24:46.485
I'm a nuisance for her,

24:45.165 --> 24:46.485
aren't I?

24:49.205 --> 24:51.245
I mean, it's been ten minutes.

24:49.205 --> 24:51.245
I'm still waiting for Tanya.

24:51.285 --> 24:53.165
-Hello. Hi.

24:51.285 --> 24:53.165
-Ah, here we are.

24:53.205 --> 24:55.005
-Let's have a look

24:53.205 --> 24:55.005
at your restaurant.

24:53.205 --> 24:55.005
-Okay.

24:56.405 --> 24:58.925
[Fred] Tanya,

24:56.405 --> 24:58.925
I love your logo,

24:56.405 --> 24:58.925
the way it's done.

24:58.965 --> 25:03.085
Good, they were inspired

24:58.965 --> 25:03.085
by my tattoo,

24:58.965 --> 25:03.085
which is very similar.

25:03.125 --> 25:05.685
Because it's a part

25:03.125 --> 25:05.685
of the whole women thing.

25:05.725 --> 25:08.965
Tell me more about that

25:05.725 --> 25:08.965
women thing. I am very

25:05.725 --> 25:08.965
interested with that.

25:09.005 --> 25:10.885
I'm the first

25:09.005 --> 25:10.885
of the women in my family

25:10.925 --> 25:13.285
who have actually done

25:10.925 --> 25:13.285
something with food

25:10.925 --> 25:13.285
professionally.

25:13.325 --> 25:15.485
They are all much better

25:13.325 --> 25:15.485
cooks than me,

25:15.525 --> 25:17.245
and then none of them

25:15.525 --> 25:17.245
are professional chefs.

25:17.285 --> 25:19.925
I like it. I like it.

25:17.285 --> 25:19.925
I can see how focused you are,

25:19.965 --> 25:22.365
and it's very important.

25:19.965 --> 25:22.365
Listen, I've got to let

25:19.965 --> 25:22.365
you get on.

25:22.405 --> 25:24.005
-You do, yes.

25:22.405 --> 25:24.005
-Otherwise you're going

25:22.405 --> 25:24.005
to start to tell me off.

25:24.045 --> 25:25.365
Yes, exactly right.

25:25.405 --> 25:28.485
Guys take care.

25:25.405 --> 25:28.485
Don't mess with Tanya.

25:25.405 --> 25:28.485
Good luck.

25:28.525 --> 25:30.885
Thank you very much.

25:28.525 --> 25:30.885
Thank you.

25:30.925 --> 25:33.165
He got annoyed

25:30.925 --> 25:33.165
'cause I kept him waiting.

25:30.925 --> 25:33.165
And I was like,

25:33.205 --> 25:35.605
I've got a job to do, mate.

25:33.205 --> 25:35.605
Not flirt with a Frenchman.

25:36.485 --> 25:37.725
[Fred]<i> Flirting,</i> moi?

25:38.725 --> 25:41.885
<i>Dinner tonight</i>

25:38.725 --> 25:41.885
<i>will be a soft launch.</i>

25:41.925 --> 25:43.725
<i>It's standard</i>

25:41.925 --> 25:43.725
<i>industry practice.</i>

25:43.765 --> 25:45.925
<i>Customers will pay half price</i>

25:45.965 --> 25:48.885
<i>as Tanya road tests</i>

25:45.965 --> 25:48.885
<i>her food and service.</i>

25:50.005 --> 25:51.845
<i>She's developed</i>

25:50.005 --> 25:51.845
<i>her street food</i>

25:51.885 --> 25:54.405
<i>for tonight's upmarket</i>

25:51.885 --> 25:54.405
<i>restaurant setting,</i>

25:54.445 --> 25:59.365
<i>with recipes from Indo-Persia</i>

25:54.445 --> 25:59.365
<i>to the eastern Mediterranean.</i>

25:59.405 --> 26:02.325
[Tanya]<i> The four at the top</i>

25:59.405 --> 26:02.325
<i>are smaller plates.</i>

26:02.365 --> 26:05.325
<i>So, they're like tapas,</i>

26:02.365 --> 26:05.325
<i>meze kinds of plates.</i>

26:05.365 --> 26:08.645
[Fred]<i> Tanya's menu</i>

26:05.365 --> 26:08.645
<i>consists of four small plates</i>

26:08.685 --> 26:10.765
<i>and three larger dishes.</i>

26:10.805 --> 26:14.845
<i>And she's hoping</i>

26:10.805 --> 26:14.845
<i>for an average spend</i>

26:10.805 --> 26:14.845
<i>of £30 per person.</i>

26:16.605 --> 26:18.965
<i>A small plate</i>

26:16.605 --> 26:18.965
<i>of turmeric avocado</i>

26:19.005 --> 26:22.445
<i>blended with charred corn</i>

26:19.005 --> 26:22.445
<i>costs £6.</i>

26:24.365 --> 26:27.405
<i>Tanya's rich, roasted</i>

26:24.365 --> 26:27.405
<i>cauliflower korma</i>

26:27.445 --> 26:31.005
<i>with coconut and almond</i>

26:27.445 --> 26:31.005
<i>is a large dish at £12.</i>

26:32.845 --> 26:35.125
<i>And a slow-cooked</i>

26:32.845 --> 26:35.125
<i>onion bhaji curry</i>

26:35.165 --> 26:37.645
<i>garnished with lemon</i>

26:35.165 --> 26:37.645
<i>and coriander</i>

26:37.685 --> 26:40.445
<i>is another large dish,</i>

26:37.685 --> 26:40.445
<i>for £11.</i>

26:42.605 --> 26:44.605
There is no meat

26:42.605 --> 26:44.605
on Tanya's menu.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.005
A few years ago,

26:44.645 --> 26:47.005
that would have

26:44.645 --> 26:47.005
been risky business.

26:47.045 --> 26:50.565
But now

26:47.045 --> 26:50.565
there are seven million

26:47.045 --> 26:50.565
vegetarians in the UK

26:50.605 --> 26:52.965
and half of the meat eaters

26:50.605 --> 26:52.965
want to cut down.

26:53.005 --> 26:54.885
That's good news for Devi's.

26:54.925 --> 26:57.765
<i>And maybe that's why Tanya</i>

26:54.925 --> 26:57.765
<i>has caught the eye</i>

26:57.805 --> 26:59.725
<i>of some serious</i>

26:57.805 --> 26:59.725
<i>business brains.</i>

27:03.245 --> 27:06.205
<i>Two weeks after the investors</i>

27:03.245 --> 27:06.205
<i>tasted Devi's,</i>

27:06.245 --> 27:10.165
<i>they are in Manchester</i>

27:06.245 --> 27:10.165
<i>for a second bite.</i>

27:10.205 --> 27:15.645
<i>Over two days,</i>

27:10.205 --> 27:15.645
<i>they'll test Tanya's food,</i>

27:10.205 --> 27:15.645
<i>service and business plan.</i>

27:15.685 --> 27:18.125
<i>Tomorrow evening,</i>

27:15.685 --> 27:18.125
<i>if they like what they see,</i>

27:18.165 --> 27:19.805
<i>there might be</i>

27:18.165 --> 27:19.805
<i>a fight to invest.</i>

27:21.005 --> 27:23.685
<i>First to arrive</i>

27:21.005 --> 27:23.685
<i>is Laura Harper-Hinton,</i>

27:23.725 --> 27:27.605
<i>CEO of Caravan Restaurants</i>

27:23.725 --> 27:27.605
<i>and Coffee Roasters,</i>

27:27.645 --> 27:30.445
<i>a group that's taking</i>

27:27.645 --> 27:30.445
<i>all-day dining by storm.</i>

27:30.485 --> 27:33.005
I don't think investing

27:30.485 --> 27:33.005
is all about making money.

27:33.045 --> 27:35.685
Obviously,

27:33.045 --> 27:35.685
it's got to stand up

27:33.045 --> 27:35.685
as a viable business plan.

27:35.725 --> 27:38.565
<i>But I like to think that you</i>

27:35.725 --> 27:38.565
<i>can also approach investing</i>

27:38.605 --> 27:40.805
<i>with a much more mindful</i>

27:38.605 --> 27:40.805
<i>set of principles.</i>

27:40.845 --> 27:43.365
Is it something

27:40.845 --> 27:43.365
that is benefiting

27:40.845 --> 27:43.365
the environment?

27:43.405 --> 27:45.485
Is it something that's

27:43.405 --> 27:45.485
benefiting society

27:43.405 --> 27:45.485
in some way?

27:45.525 --> 27:48.405
<i>And the most important thing</i>

27:45.525 --> 27:48.405
<i>that attracted me to Tanya</i>

27:48.445 --> 27:52.565
<i>is this amazing plant-based,</i>

27:48.445 --> 27:52.565
<i>vegetarian, vegan concept</i>

27:48.445 --> 27:52.565
<i>for a restaurant.</i>

27:52.605 --> 27:54.765
I think if you're going

27:52.605 --> 27:54.765
to place your money somewhere,

27:54.805 --> 27:57.565
you might like to think

27:54.805 --> 27:57.565
that you're going to get

27:54.805 --> 27:57.565
some kind of positive outcome.

27:57.605 --> 28:02.005
[Fred]<i> Shruti Ajitsaria</i>

27:57.605 --> 28:02.005
<i>is a lawyer</i>

27:57.605 --> 28:02.005
<i>and angel investor.</i>

28:02.045 --> 28:04.205
<i>She's backed</i>

28:02.045 --> 28:04.205
<i>a wide range of start-ups,</i>

28:04.245 --> 28:07.205
<i>including a string</i>

28:04.245 --> 28:07.205
<i>of successful restaurants.</i>

28:07.245 --> 28:09.405
The spark for me was

28:07.245 --> 28:09.405
when I tasted her food

28:09.445 --> 28:11.685
I thought

28:09.445 --> 28:11.685
it was absolutely delicious.

28:11.725 --> 28:14.485
<i>I just need to be convinced</i>

28:11.725 --> 28:14.485
<i>that she'll be able to stand</i>

28:11.725 --> 28:14.485
<i>on her own two feet.</i>

28:14.525 --> 28:16.605
<i>That she'll understand</i>

28:14.525 --> 28:16.605
<i>what it takes to run</i>

28:14.525 --> 28:16.605
<i>a restaurant.</i>

28:16.645 --> 28:18.845
As an investor

28:16.645 --> 28:18.845
with investments across

28:18.885 --> 28:21.205
various different sectors

28:18.885 --> 28:21.205
and an actual job,

28:21.245 --> 28:22.645
<i>I don't tend</i>

28:21.245 --> 28:22.645
<i>to get involved.</i>

28:22.685 --> 28:25.565
So, I need to know

28:22.685 --> 28:25.565
she can make this work

28:22.685 --> 28:25.565
by herself.

28:25.605 --> 28:28.645
[Tanya] So, do you want

28:25.605 --> 28:28.645
to just come over

28:25.605 --> 28:28.645
and join us, guys?

28:28.685 --> 28:31.685
[Fred]<i> The investors will</i>

28:28.685 --> 28:31.685
<i>sit down for dinner at Devi's</i>

28:31.725 --> 28:33.725
<i>in just three hours' time.</i>

28:33.765 --> 28:35.325
Tanya is about

28:33.765 --> 28:35.325
to brief her team

28:35.365 --> 28:37.565
and tell them

28:35.365 --> 28:37.565
how service will run.

28:37.605 --> 28:40.285
She needs to be clear

28:37.605 --> 28:40.285
and very precise.

28:40.325 --> 28:43.205
Everyone needs to know

28:40.325 --> 28:43.205
what they have to do.

28:43.245 --> 28:46.685
Because Shruti and Laura

28:43.245 --> 28:46.685
want to see perfection

28:43.245 --> 28:46.685
tonight.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.645
Raj is our maitre d',

28:48.685 --> 28:50.605
so he's going to be

28:48.685 --> 28:50.605
leading the show

28:50.645 --> 28:53.205
with a keen eye

28:50.645 --> 28:53.205
on the entrance.

28:53.245 --> 28:54.685
Isabelle and Beatriz,

28:54.725 --> 28:58.245
and Flo, I want

28:54.725 --> 28:58.245
your main focus

28:58.285 --> 29:00.325
with the plates

28:58.285 --> 29:00.325
leaving the kitchen.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.245
Because the food comes out

29:00.365 --> 29:02.245
when it's ready,

29:02.285 --> 29:05.045
there's no such thing

29:02.285 --> 29:05.045
as starter, main course,

29:02.285 --> 29:05.045
dessert.

29:05.085 --> 29:08.325
And let's say I order

29:05.085 --> 29:08.325
four plates, how long

29:05.085 --> 29:08.325
will be the first one?

29:10.445 --> 29:13.045
[Tanya] Um, the food

29:10.445 --> 29:13.045
comes out of the kitchen

29:10.445 --> 29:13.045
as and when it's ready

29:13.085 --> 29:16.085
because it's all about

29:13.085 --> 29:16.085
feasting and sharing.

29:16.125 --> 29:18.925
Sure, but is it ready

29:16.125 --> 29:18.925
in five minutes, ten minutes,

29:16.125 --> 29:18.925
20 minutes?

29:18.965 --> 29:22.725
What is your expectation

29:18.965 --> 29:22.725
for the food to come out

29:18.965 --> 29:22.725
of that kitchen?

29:22.765 --> 29:25.085
[Tanya] How long

29:22.765 --> 29:25.085
is a piece of string?

29:25.125 --> 29:27.725
It could be short,

29:25.125 --> 29:27.725
it could be long.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.565
In my restaurants,

29:29.605 --> 29:31.645
a starter would take

29:29.605 --> 29:31.645
ten to 12 minutes,

29:31.685 --> 29:32.565
and a main course 15 to 20.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.285
I think that's brilliant.

29:34.325 --> 29:36.285
However, things are going

29:34.325 --> 29:36.285
to take longer because

29:34.325 --> 29:36.285
it's the first time.

29:36.325 --> 29:38.605
Just try and knock out

29:36.325 --> 29:38.605
those complaints.

29:38.645 --> 29:40.965
So, what you're saying is,

29:38.645 --> 29:40.965
you are expecting complaints.

29:43.165 --> 29:44.765
Tanya is not

29:43.165 --> 29:44.765
a professional.

29:44.805 --> 29:46.285
She has never

29:44.805 --> 29:46.285
run a restaurant,

29:46.325 --> 29:48.565
so there are inevitable

29:46.325 --> 29:48.565
gaps there.

29:48.605 --> 29:50.565
What is worrying, for me,

29:50.605 --> 29:53.365
is when I questioned her

29:50.605 --> 29:53.365
about these gaps

29:53.405 --> 29:56.045
she became very defensive,

29:56.085 --> 29:58.045
and on top of that,

29:56.085 --> 29:58.045
she didn't have any answers.

29:58.085 --> 30:01.845
<i>And that could be</i>

29:58.085 --> 30:01.845
<i>a real problem going</i>

29:58.085 --> 30:01.845
<i>into tonight's service.</i>

30:04.125 --> 30:05.405
[Tanya] I'll fix it.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.405
I'll fix it.

30:06.565 --> 30:08.805
[Fred]<i> Devi's opens</i>

30:06.565 --> 30:08.805
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

30:08.845 --> 30:11.325
<i>Tanya is about to run</i>

30:08.845 --> 30:11.325
<i>her own restaurant...</i>

30:11.685 --> 30:13.205
[grunts]

30:13.245 --> 30:15.685
[Fred]<i> ...just four years</i>

30:13.245 --> 30:15.685
<i>after starting</i>

30:13.245 --> 30:15.685
<i>in the industry.</i>

30:15.725 --> 30:19.365
I'm the kind of person

30:15.725 --> 30:19.365
that's jumped

30:15.725 --> 30:19.365
from career to career.

30:19.405 --> 30:21.245
<i>First, I wanted</i>

30:19.405 --> 30:21.245
<i>to work in fashion,</i>

30:21.285 --> 30:23.405
<i>and then I wanted</i>

30:21.285 --> 30:23.405
<i>to do social work.</i>

30:23.445 --> 30:25.565
Indian families

30:23.445 --> 30:25.565
want you to be a doctor,

30:25.605 --> 30:27.125
a lawyer or work in finance,

30:27.165 --> 30:29.325
<i>and it was only</i>

30:27.165 --> 30:29.325
<i>two years ago</i>

30:29.365 --> 30:32.485
my dad stopped asking me

30:29.365 --> 30:32.485
if I wanted to be a lawyer.

30:32.525 --> 30:34.165
<i>Now my life is Devi's</i>

30:34.205 --> 30:37.605
and I can't really

30:34.205 --> 30:37.605
imagine what I'd be doing

30:34.205 --> 30:37.605
if I wasn't doing this.

30:40.685 --> 30:42.765
[Fred]<i> 5:15. Devi's is open.</i>

30:43.885 --> 30:45.565
-We have guests.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.565
-Yeah.

30:45.605 --> 30:48.165
[Fred]<i> Sixty people</i>

30:45.605 --> 30:48.165
<i>are booked in for dinner.</i>

30:48.205 --> 30:51.725
This is where it all begins.

30:48.205 --> 30:51.725
It all starts now.

30:51.765 --> 30:54.325
[Fred]<i> With Tanya</i>

30:51.765 --> 30:54.325
<i>leading the kitchen,</i>

30:54.365 --> 30:57.405
<i>and brother Raj in charge</i>

30:54.365 --> 30:57.405
<i>of front of house.</i>

30:57.445 --> 30:59.125
[Raj] Hello, hi.

30:57.445 --> 30:59.125
How are you doing?

30:59.725 --> 31:01.965
Table six.

31:02.005 --> 31:03.645
Just to sort of explain

31:02.005 --> 31:03.645
what Devi's is all about.

31:03.685 --> 31:06.725
-[woman] Yes.

31:03.685 --> 31:06.725
-We're a plant-focused

31:03.685 --> 31:06.725
dining concept.

31:06.765 --> 31:10.405
We've taken flavors

31:06.765 --> 31:10.405
from the ancient spice routes

31:06.765 --> 31:10.405
and silk roads.

31:10.445 --> 31:12.325
First order

31:10.445 --> 31:12.325
is turmeric avocado

31:12.365 --> 31:14.245
and a Peshawari cauliflower.

31:14.285 --> 31:15.805
Make sure that I see

31:14.285 --> 31:15.805
the plate when it goes out

31:15.845 --> 31:17.245
so that I can ensure

31:15.845 --> 31:17.245
that it's perfect.

31:19.605 --> 31:21.445
[Raj] Good evening,

31:19.605 --> 31:21.445
thank you so much

31:19.605 --> 31:21.445
for joining us at Devi's.

31:21.485 --> 31:23.845
I'll start with a small

31:21.485 --> 31:23.845
introduction about who we are

31:23.885 --> 31:25.125
and what it's about.

31:25.165 --> 31:27.325
[Fred]<i> It's 20 minutes</i>

31:25.165 --> 31:27.325
<i>since service began...</i>

31:27.365 --> 31:29.085
[Raj] The concept

31:27.365 --> 31:29.085
was devised by my

31:27.365 --> 31:29.085
sister, Tanya,

31:29.125 --> 31:30.645
who's currently

31:29.125 --> 31:30.645
in the kitchen.

31:30.685 --> 31:33.565
And it's basically

31:30.685 --> 31:33.565
plant-focused conceptual

31:30.685 --> 31:33.565
dining experience.

31:33.605 --> 31:35.645
[Fred]<i> ...and I've already</i>

31:33.605 --> 31:35.645
<i>spotted a problem.</i>

31:35.685 --> 31:39.725
Ancient Persia,

31:35.685 --> 31:39.725
all of the Middle East,

31:35.685 --> 31:39.725
the Arabian Peninsula...

31:39.765 --> 31:41.445
Raj here has been

31:39.765 --> 31:41.445
at this table for the last

31:41.485 --> 31:43.445
two, three minutes

31:41.485 --> 31:43.445
explaining the menu.

31:43.485 --> 31:46.525
But while he does this,

31:43.485 --> 31:46.525
he's not there

31:43.485 --> 31:46.525
at the reception,

31:46.565 --> 31:49.125
meeting and greeting

31:46.565 --> 31:49.125
the other guests

31:46.565 --> 31:49.125
who are going to arrive.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.365
Ah, Tanya, who is working

31:50.325 --> 31:52.365
on reception?

31:52.405 --> 31:53.885
Who is meeting

31:52.405 --> 31:53.885
and greeting guests?

31:55.605 --> 31:56.685
Is it Raj?

31:56.725 --> 31:57.925
[Tanya] Yeah.

31:57.965 --> 31:59.285
[Fred] Because I can't see

31:57.965 --> 31:59.285
Raj anywhere there.

32:00.925 --> 32:02.565
Front of house

32:00.925 --> 32:02.565
has gone topsy-turvy.

32:04.405 --> 32:06.605
[Fred]<i> With Raj taking</i>

32:04.405 --> 32:06.605
<i>so long at each table,</i>

32:06.645 --> 32:09.885
<i>the other waitresses</i>

32:06.645 --> 32:09.885
<i>are having to greet customers.</i>

32:09.925 --> 32:12.085
-Everything that we did

32:09.925 --> 32:12.085
during the briefing...

32:09.925 --> 32:12.085
-[bell dings]

32:12.125 --> 32:13.925
-One second please

32:12.125 --> 32:13.925
-...is not happening.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.765
[Isabelle]

32:13.965 --> 32:16.765
So, it's just this table

32:13.965 --> 32:16.765
here, if that's okay?

32:16.805 --> 32:20.805
There is a complete

32:16.805 --> 32:20.805
breakdown of the roles

32:16.805 --> 32:20.805
that were defined by Tanya,

32:20.845 --> 32:23.605
and nobody is doing what

32:20.845 --> 32:23.605
they were supposed to do.

32:23.645 --> 32:25.725
Tanya, instead

32:23.645 --> 32:25.725
of leading her team,

32:25.765 --> 32:27.805
is behind here,

32:25.765 --> 32:27.805
in the kitchen.

32:27.845 --> 32:31.165
The autumnal vegetable bhaji

32:27.845 --> 32:31.165
is a bit spicier.

32:31.205 --> 32:34.445
If anyone comes through

32:31.205 --> 32:34.445
the door now, they will

32:31.205 --> 32:34.445
have no welcome.

32:40.165 --> 32:42.805
<i>Oh,</i> mon Dieu.

32:40.165 --> 32:42.805
<i>The investors are coming.</i>

32:45.845 --> 32:47.645
Honestly, since I had

32:45.845 --> 32:47.645
her last plate of food

32:47.685 --> 32:48.885
I've been thinking about it.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.605
I really honestly thought

32:48.925 --> 32:50.605
it was delicious

32:50.645 --> 32:52.685
<i>and I am so excited</i>

32:50.645 --> 32:52.685
<i>to eat her food tonight.</i>

32:52.725 --> 32:54.125
If it turns out

32:52.725 --> 32:54.125
she's terrible at cooking

32:54.165 --> 32:55.645
I'm going to be

32:54.165 --> 32:55.645
genuinely gutted.

32:57.485 --> 32:59.885
[Laura]<i> I wanna</i>

32:57.485 --> 32:59.885
<i>get that first sense</i>

32:59.925 --> 33:01.845
of the restaurant

32:59.925 --> 33:01.845
as soon as I walk in.

33:01.885 --> 33:04.525
<i>What does it feel like?</i>

33:01.885 --> 33:04.525
<i>What is the greeting like?</i>

33:04.565 --> 33:06.605
And a real sense that

33:04.565 --> 33:06.605
Tanya and her team

33:06.645 --> 33:10.325
can create a really

33:06.645 --> 33:10.325
beautiful experience

33:06.645 --> 33:10.325
for the customer.

33:11.565 --> 33:12.965
If you'd like to take a seat.

33:13.005 --> 33:14.125
-Oh, sure. Yeah.

33:13.005 --> 33:14.125
-Thank you.

33:22.005 --> 33:23.885
Okay, well,

33:22.005 --> 33:23.885
this is less than ideal.

33:30.245 --> 33:31.325
[Raj] Your table's ready

33:30.245 --> 33:31.325
actually, sir. Perfect.

33:31.365 --> 33:32.805
Perfect, just please

33:31.365 --> 33:32.805
follow me.

33:36.525 --> 33:38.965
This is a major problem.

33:36.525 --> 33:38.965
Just being told to sit

33:36.525 --> 33:38.965
like this.

33:39.005 --> 33:41.045
-Just sitting here.

33:39.005 --> 33:41.045
-Major problem.

33:41.085 --> 33:42.925
[Laura] Do you think

33:41.085 --> 33:42.925
he's the maitre d'?

33:42.965 --> 33:46.285
I'm guessing.

33:42.965 --> 33:46.285
Although he doesn't seem

33:42.965 --> 33:46.285
very well-organized, does he?

33:46.325 --> 33:47.565
[Laura] No.

33:47.605 --> 33:49.725
Hello, hi, good evening.

33:47.605 --> 33:49.725
Sorry for the wait.

33:49.765 --> 33:51.325
-[Shruti] That's okay.

33:49.765 --> 33:51.325
-Rajish, good to meet you.

33:51.365 --> 33:52.845
-Can I show you

33:51.365 --> 33:52.845
to your table?

33:51.365 --> 33:52.845
-Yes.

33:52.885 --> 33:54.085
I'll just grab

33:52.885 --> 33:54.085
a couple of menus.

33:55.725 --> 33:57.525
The investors are here,

33:57.565 --> 34:00.365
and so Raj has seated them.

34:00.405 --> 34:02.125
[Laura] How many times

34:00.405 --> 34:02.125
have you walked into

34:00.405 --> 34:02.125
a restaurant

34:02.165 --> 34:03.845
where there's been no one

34:02.165 --> 34:03.845
at the reception desk?

34:03.885 --> 34:07.885
I don't think that's ever

34:03.885 --> 34:07.885
happened to me, ever.

34:07.925 --> 34:09.405
In any restaurant.

34:09.445 --> 34:11.005
[Laura] Right, shall we

34:09.445 --> 34:11.005
have a look at the menu?

34:13.405 --> 34:14.885
I'm going to look

34:13.405 --> 34:14.885
at the wine list first.

34:14.925 --> 34:17.445
I've gone straight to food.

34:14.925 --> 34:17.445
It looks delicious.

34:17.485 --> 34:19.925
[Flo]

34:17.485 --> 34:19.925
The Peshawari cauliflower,

34:17.485 --> 34:19.925
and the za'tar bread.

34:19.965 --> 34:20.805
[man] All right. Thank you.

34:22.405 --> 34:24.725
[Raj] It's very much a tapas,

34:22.405 --> 34:24.725
meze style of concept.

34:24.765 --> 34:27.285
I'd probably recommend

34:24.765 --> 34:27.285
one small plate per person

34:27.325 --> 34:29.725
and a larger, sort of,

34:27.325 --> 34:29.725
plate to share.

34:29.765 --> 34:31.525
I will let you peruse

34:29.765 --> 34:31.525
for a few minutes.

34:31.565 --> 34:33.285
[Laura] Thank you.

34:33.325 --> 34:35.645
Right, guys, we're going

34:33.325 --> 34:35.645
to have the investor table

34:33.325 --> 34:35.645
coming through soon.

34:37.045 --> 34:39.165
He said that

34:37.045 --> 34:39.165
we should order...

34:39.205 --> 34:41.405
Two small plates,

34:39.205 --> 34:41.405
one large to share.

34:41.445 --> 34:43.845
If we throw in a couple

34:41.445 --> 34:43.845
of expensive glasses of wine,

34:43.885 --> 34:47.445
we would've got to about

34:43.885 --> 34:47.445
£40 for the two of us.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.725
Yep. Exactly,

34:47.485 --> 34:48.725
so we're at £20--

34:48.765 --> 34:51.285
Just at £20 per head.

34:48.765 --> 34:51.285
It's no good.

34:51.325 --> 34:52.965
That's an issue

34:53.005 --> 34:56.325
because she's trying

34:53.005 --> 34:56.325
to target £30 per head

34:53.005 --> 34:56.325
in her business plan

34:56.365 --> 34:57.845
as an ideal spend--

34:57.885 --> 35:00.285
Hi. We're ready

34:57.885 --> 35:00.285
to order, yeah.

34:57.885 --> 35:00.285
Thank you.

35:00.325 --> 35:03.285
I'm thinking about getting

35:00.325 --> 35:03.285
the whipped feta,

35:03.325 --> 35:04.805
-the pakora.

35:03.325 --> 35:04.805
-The pakora, please.

35:04.845 --> 35:07.725
Um, would you say

35:04.845 --> 35:07.725
that's enough

35:04.845 --> 35:07.725
for the two of us?

35:07.765 --> 35:09.125
I'd say that's ample.

35:09.165 --> 35:10.725
-That's great,

35:09.165 --> 35:10.725
thank you so much.

35:09.165 --> 35:10.725
-Thank you so much.

35:10.765 --> 35:12.685
-Right, this is the investors

35:10.765 --> 35:12.685
we're cooking for, yeah?

35:10.765 --> 35:12.685
-Yeah.

35:14.525 --> 35:18.005
Everyone, the best plate

35:14.525 --> 35:18.005
of food you've ever made

35:14.525 --> 35:18.005
this evening.

35:18.045 --> 35:20.765
Try to pick up the speed

35:18.045 --> 35:20.765
with these orders.

35:20.805 --> 35:24.205
[Fred]<i> The investors</i>

35:20.805 --> 35:24.205
<i>could face a long wait</i>

35:20.805 --> 35:24.205
<i>for their food.</i>

35:24.245 --> 35:25.965
<i>There is a backlog</i>

35:24.245 --> 35:25.965
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

35:26.005 --> 35:27.645
After those, she needs

35:26.005 --> 35:27.645
to start on those.

35:27.685 --> 35:30.285
Yeah just, love,

35:27.685 --> 35:30.285
please let me get

35:27.685 --> 35:30.285
the orders out.

35:30.325 --> 35:32.325
Just give me one minute,

35:30.325 --> 35:32.325
that's all I'm asking.

35:32.365 --> 35:35.285
They are cooking one table

35:32.365 --> 35:35.285
at a time in the kitchen.

35:35.325 --> 35:37.685
<i>Like she would</i>

35:35.325 --> 35:37.685
<i>on her street stall, but...</i>

35:37.725 --> 35:40.165
In restaurant like this,

35:37.725 --> 35:40.165
when you are cooking

35:37.725 --> 35:40.165
food to order,

35:40.205 --> 35:43.605
you should be cooking

35:40.205 --> 35:43.605
for two, three, four, five

35:40.205 --> 35:43.605
tables at the same time.

35:43.645 --> 35:45.565
But here they go

35:43.645 --> 35:45.565
from one table at a time.

35:45.605 --> 35:47.845
This is obviously

35:45.605 --> 35:47.845
slowing down the system.

35:47.885 --> 35:50.805
<i>And fair enough, customers</i>

35:47.885 --> 35:50.805
<i>are getting impatient.</i>

35:50.845 --> 35:52.645
My stomach is starting

35:50.845 --> 35:52.645
to rumble a bit.

35:52.685 --> 35:55.765
An hour and a quarter

35:52.685 --> 35:55.765
is a long time to wait.

35:55.805 --> 35:58.285
Twenty minutes before

35:55.805 --> 35:58.285
the first dish hits the table

35:58.325 --> 36:00.045
is probably a bit long.

36:00.085 --> 36:02.485
I would definitely want to see

36:00.085 --> 36:02.485
at least one or two dishes

36:00.085 --> 36:02.485
out by now.

36:02.525 --> 36:03.805
Which one's table four?

36:04.845 --> 36:05.765
[Fred]<i> I think I can help.</i>

36:07.165 --> 36:09.005
If you're cooking

36:07.165 --> 36:09.005
all the food to order,

36:09.045 --> 36:10.725
what you could do

36:10.765 --> 36:13.165
-is put the checks like that,

36:10.765 --> 36:13.165
one, two, three, four, five.

36:10.765 --> 36:13.165
-Oh, yeah.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.645
And then cook

36:13.205 --> 36:15.645
one dish for one table,

36:15.685 --> 36:16.925
and another one for another.

36:16.965 --> 36:18.725
-You've got to do

36:16.965 --> 36:18.725
something about it...

36:16.965 --> 36:18.725
-Okay.

36:18.765 --> 36:20.685
-...because you know you've

36:18.765 --> 36:20.685
got a problem on your hands.

36:18.765 --> 36:20.685
-[Tanya] Okay.

36:22.125 --> 36:26.125
Few teething problems,

36:22.125 --> 36:26.125
but we will get back

36:22.125 --> 36:26.125
up to speed.

36:26.165 --> 36:29.605
These are

36:26.165 --> 36:29.605
the smashed potatoes.

36:26.165 --> 36:29.605
Investors' bhajis.

36:31.805 --> 36:33.645
-Sweet potato

36:31.805 --> 36:33.645
and kale pakora.

36:31.805 --> 36:33.645
-Thanks.

36:33.685 --> 36:35.805
[Shruti] Thank you.

36:33.685 --> 36:35.805
Thank you very much.

36:35.845 --> 36:38.685
[Laura] I think

36:35.845 --> 36:38.685
the presentation looks

36:35.845 --> 36:38.685
absolutely fantastic.

36:38.725 --> 36:41.125
Looks like food

36:38.725 --> 36:41.125
that I want to eat.

36:46.605 --> 36:47.685
Not loving it?

36:47.725 --> 36:48.965
No.

36:49.005 --> 36:50.525
The thing that I thought

36:49.005 --> 36:50.525
was a given for tonight

36:50.565 --> 36:53.885
-was that the food

36:50.565 --> 36:53.885
would knock me out.

36:50.565 --> 36:53.885
-Yep.

36:53.925 --> 36:56.285
[Laura] So, what do you think

36:53.925 --> 36:56.285
about the portion sizes?

36:56.325 --> 36:59.285
That's not what I would have

36:56.325 --> 36:59.285
expected, to be honest,

36:59.325 --> 37:00.725
by way of a small plate.

37:00.765 --> 37:02.325
That's £8.

37:02.365 --> 37:04.485
-It's going to fill

37:02.365 --> 37:04.485
people up really quickly.

37:02.365 --> 37:04.485
-[Shruti] Yeah.

37:04.525 --> 37:05.925
Which would concern me

37:05.965 --> 37:07.445
with trying to get

37:05.965 --> 37:07.445
people to order

37:07.485 --> 37:09.925
lots of different things

37:07.485 --> 37:09.925
and try lots of different

37:07.485 --> 37:09.925
dishes.

37:09.965 --> 37:11.485
How are you, ladies?

37:09.965 --> 37:11.485
How's it going?

37:11.525 --> 37:12.845
-Great, thank you.

37:11.525 --> 37:12.845
-[Shruti] Fred, good.

37:12.885 --> 37:13.965
[Laura] Have you eaten?

37:14.005 --> 37:15.605
I have eaten.

37:14.005 --> 37:15.605
Yeah, I have eaten that.

37:15.645 --> 37:17.285
-[Shruti] What did you think?

37:15.645 --> 37:17.285
-It was very fresh,

37:15.645 --> 37:17.285
it was nice.

37:17.325 --> 37:19.725
So, I don't think the food

37:17.325 --> 37:19.725
is perfect, if I'm honest.

37:19.765 --> 37:22.085
It wasn't as good

37:19.765 --> 37:22.085
as what we tried in London.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.365
-Right.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.365
-Fred, do you know

37:22.125 --> 37:24.365
what you need to do?

37:24.405 --> 37:26.965
You need to tighten up

37:24.405 --> 37:26.965
their front of house

37:24.405 --> 37:26.965
situation.

37:27.005 --> 37:28.445
They've made errors.

37:28.485 --> 37:30.285
I think that they will

37:28.485 --> 37:30.285
talk about what they've

37:28.485 --> 37:30.285
done wrong

37:30.325 --> 37:31.925
and tomorrow,

37:30.325 --> 37:31.925
it will be better.

37:31.965 --> 37:34.565
Yeah, we do have to be

37:31.965 --> 37:34.565
a little bit forgiving

37:31.965 --> 37:34.565
because, you know,

37:34.605 --> 37:36.285
it's the first time that

37:34.605 --> 37:36.285
they're, you know,

37:36.325 --> 37:38.085
smashing the food out.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.325
[Fred] Are you still excited

37:38.125 --> 37:40.325
about coming tomorrow?

37:40.365 --> 37:41.765
I'm excited to come back.

37:41.805 --> 37:43.165
There are a few things

37:41.805 --> 37:43.165
that I think

37:43.205 --> 37:44.405
I'd quite like to talk

37:43.205 --> 37:44.405
to Tanya about.

37:44.445 --> 37:45.925
She needs to figure out

37:44.445 --> 37:45.925
how she's going to get

37:45.965 --> 37:48.405
to her £30 per person spend

37:48.445 --> 37:50.365
because she's not hitting

37:48.445 --> 37:50.365
that at the moment with us.

37:50.405 --> 37:52.605
This is huge for six quid.

37:52.645 --> 37:56.445
And ultimately if you're

37:52.645 --> 37:56.445
trying to get up to your

37:52.645 --> 37:56.445
£30 per head spend

37:56.485 --> 37:59.285
and you're going to fill

37:56.485 --> 37:59.285
people up on a £6 dish

37:56.485 --> 37:59.285
like this...

37:59.325 --> 38:00.605
I mean you just eat that

37:59.325 --> 38:00.605
then you're full, for sure.

38:02.525 --> 38:04.925
I think she's got some

38:02.525 --> 38:04.925
work to do on a few

38:02.525 --> 38:04.925
of her dishes.

38:04.965 --> 38:07.725
<i>But my major concern</i>

38:04.965 --> 38:07.725
<i>really lies around</i>

38:07.765 --> 38:09.805
how you navigate that menu

38:09.845 --> 38:12.285
to make sure that

38:09.845 --> 38:12.285
you are getting people

38:09.845 --> 38:12.285
up to the spend

38:12.325 --> 38:15.285
that you actually need them to

38:12.325 --> 38:15.285
for her to be able to make

38:12.325 --> 38:15.285
some money on this.

38:15.325 --> 38:18.365
Thank you very much, team.

38:15.325 --> 38:18.365
That was absolutely delicious.

38:18.405 --> 38:20.605
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

38:20.645 --> 38:23.685
[Laura]<i> I have</i>

38:20.645 --> 38:23.685
<i>quite significant</i>

38:20.645 --> 38:23.685
<i>concerns over,</i>

38:23.725 --> 38:25.205
you know, how much

38:23.725 --> 38:25.205
she's actually going

38:23.725 --> 38:25.205
to get on,

38:25.245 --> 38:27.445
you know, her ticket

38:25.245 --> 38:27.445
for a per-head spend.

38:27.485 --> 38:30.965
You know, and that means

38:27.485 --> 38:30.965
that if it's going to be lower

38:27.485 --> 38:30.965
than what she's projecting,

38:31.005 --> 38:33.085
she's gonna need to serve

38:31.005 --> 38:33.085
a lot more people

38:33.125 --> 38:35.485
<i>than I think that she has,</i>

38:33.125 --> 38:35.485
<i>you know, estimated.</i>

38:35.525 --> 38:38.205
So, does it stack up

38:35.525 --> 38:38.205
financially? I'm not

38:35.525 --> 38:38.205
convinced yet.

38:38.245 --> 38:40.085
Take care. Bye, take care.

38:38.245 --> 38:40.085
Take care.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.765
They walked in,

38:40.125 --> 38:42.765
there was nobody

38:40.125 --> 38:42.765
at reception.

38:42.805 --> 38:44.685
They were sat on the sofas

38:44.725 --> 38:46.125
-with nobody coming

38:44.725 --> 38:46.125
to speak to--

38:44.725 --> 38:46.125
-Who were?

38:46.165 --> 38:49.605
The investors.

38:46.165 --> 38:49.605
This is not cool.

38:49.645 --> 38:52.285
I know tonight

38:49.645 --> 38:52.285
was a soft launch,

38:49.645 --> 38:52.285
but it wasn't pretty.

38:52.325 --> 38:54.405
<i>The investors saw it all.</i>

38:54.445 --> 38:56.165
<i>Tomorrow's another day,</i>

38:56.205 --> 38:58.925
but can Tanya do enough

38:56.205 --> 38:58.925
to save this opportunity?

38:58.965 --> 39:01.045
I need to practice

38:58.965 --> 39:01.045
what I preach

39:01.085 --> 39:04.805
and handle tomorrow

39:04.845 --> 39:07.445
<i>as a strong, calm</i>

39:04.845 --> 39:07.445
<i>and composed woman.</i>

39:07.485 --> 39:09.765
That's what the second chance

39:07.485 --> 39:09.765
is for, right? [laughs]

39:18.245 --> 39:21.125
[Fred]

39:18.245 --> 39:21.125
<i>There were major issues</i>

39:18.245 --> 39:21.125
<i>in Devi's last night,</i>

39:21.165 --> 39:23.325
<i>and Tanya is starting</i>

39:21.165 --> 39:23.325
<i>to realize</i>

39:23.365 --> 39:25.325
<i>she still has a lot to learn.</i>

39:25.365 --> 39:26.365
-Going okay?

39:25.365 --> 39:26.365
-[Raj] Yeah.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.725
Awesome, awesome.

39:27.765 --> 39:30.765
<i>I thought from having</i>

39:27.765 --> 39:30.765
<i>a street food business,</i>

39:30.805 --> 39:32.725
I had a lot of it

39:30.805 --> 39:32.725
sussed out.

39:32.765 --> 39:35.245
But actually,

39:32.765 --> 39:35.245
it's reminded me,

39:35.285 --> 39:38.365
and made me more aware

39:35.285 --> 39:38.365
about how much I don't know.

39:38.405 --> 39:42.605
I've got a lot to...

39:38.405 --> 39:42.605
To absorb still.

39:42.645 --> 39:45.405
[Fred]<i> This morning</i>

39:42.645 --> 39:45.405
<i>she faces business meetings</i>

39:45.445 --> 39:48.725
<i>where the investors</i>

39:45.445 --> 39:48.725
<i>will interrogate</i>

39:45.445 --> 39:48.725
<i>her financial plans,</i>

39:48.765 --> 39:52.005
<i>before they put her through</i>

39:48.765 --> 39:52.005
<i>a full lunch service.</i>

39:52.045 --> 39:56.685
<i>Only then will they decide</i>

39:52.045 --> 39:56.685
<i>whether she's worth</i>

39:52.045 --> 39:56.685
<i>an investment.</i>

39:56.725 --> 39:59.245
-Good morning.

39:56.725 --> 39:59.245
-How are you, Tanya?

39:56.725 --> 39:59.245
Did you sleep well?

39:59.285 --> 40:01.645
-Not so much,

39:59.285 --> 40:01.645
but never mind.

39:59.285 --> 40:01.645
-Not so much?

40:01.685 --> 40:02.925
But you're still looking fresh.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.765
Oh, good.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.765
You can't spend too long

40:05.805 --> 40:08.125
dwelling on things

40:05.805 --> 40:08.125
that went wrong yesterday.

40:08.165 --> 40:11.005
You have to find your fight

40:08.165 --> 40:11.005
and go back harder.

40:11.045 --> 40:13.925
-But listen, yesterday

40:11.045 --> 40:13.925
they've given some feedback.

40:11.045 --> 40:13.925
-Yes.

40:13.965 --> 40:16.005
They want a more efficient,

40:13.965 --> 40:16.005
more organized

40:16.045 --> 40:17.765
-and more focused

40:16.045 --> 40:17.765
front of house.

40:16.045 --> 40:17.765
-Sure.

40:17.805 --> 40:20.205
They've asked also

40:17.805 --> 40:20.205
for the food to have

40:17.805 --> 40:20.205
smaller portions.

40:20.245 --> 40:22.085
-Yes.

40:20.245 --> 40:22.085
-Yeah?

40:22.125 --> 40:23.885
-I think it makes sense

40:22.125 --> 40:23.885
from a business perspective.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.885
-Definitely. Definitely.

40:23.925 --> 40:26.765
And then also they want

40:23.925 --> 40:26.765
a faster turnaround

40:23.925 --> 40:26.765
of tables.

40:26.805 --> 40:28.925
Yes. Hopefully today will

40:26.805 --> 40:28.925
look like a different service,

40:28.965 --> 40:30.085
it'll feel like

40:28.965 --> 40:30.085
a different service,

40:30.125 --> 40:32.445
with all those things

40:30.125 --> 40:32.445
into action.

40:32.485 --> 40:34.405
Right, Tanya, right now

40:32.485 --> 40:34.405
you're about to go

40:34.445 --> 40:35.765
-to your finance meeting.

40:34.445 --> 40:35.765
-Mmm-hmm.

40:35.805 --> 40:37.485
I mean, you look very

40:35.805 --> 40:37.485
business-like with your suit.

40:37.525 --> 40:40.085
I'm trying

40:37.525 --> 40:40.085
to channel it, yes.

40:40.125 --> 40:41.925
'Cause tonight

40:40.125 --> 40:41.925
they could come back

40:41.965 --> 40:43.685
and give you

40:41.965 --> 40:43.685
a life-changing investment.

40:43.725 --> 40:44.845
Are you ready for this?

40:44.885 --> 40:46.485
Yes, yes,

40:44.885 --> 40:46.485
I have to be, don't I?

40:47.925 --> 40:50.405
[Fred]<i> Since pitching</i>

40:47.925 --> 40:50.405
<i>to the investors in London,</i>

40:50.445 --> 40:53.325
<i>Tanya's taken on board</i>

40:50.445 --> 40:53.325
<i>their concerns</i>

40:53.365 --> 40:55.845
<i>about the size of investment</i>

40:53.365 --> 40:55.845
<i>she was after.</i>

40:55.885 --> 41:00.565
Initially I was hoping

40:55.885 --> 41:00.565
for closer

40:55.885 --> 41:00.565
to the £1 million mark,

41:00.605 --> 41:01.925
<i>but having gone away</i>

41:01.965 --> 41:04.965
<i>and looking at those numbers</i>

41:01.965 --> 41:04.965
<i>in a detailed way,</i>

41:05.005 --> 41:08.165
I'm coming back to them

41:05.005 --> 41:08.165
with £650,000 is what

41:05.005 --> 41:08.165
we're asking for.

41:08.205 --> 41:10.565
<i>So, I hope they appreciate</i>

41:08.205 --> 41:10.565
<i>that I've done my homework</i>

41:10.605 --> 41:13.805
<i>in order to arrive</i>

41:10.605 --> 41:13.805
<i>at that figure.</i>

41:13.845 --> 41:17.165
[Fred]<i> As Shruti and Laura</i>

41:13.845 --> 41:17.165
<i>are in competition</i>

41:13.845 --> 41:17.165
<i>with each other,</i>

41:17.205 --> 41:20.645
<i>they'll each have</i>

41:17.205 --> 41:20.645
<i>an hour alone with Tanya.</i>

41:20.685 --> 41:23.445
I think the fact

41:20.685 --> 41:23.445
that she has moved

41:20.685 --> 41:23.445
from £1 million to £650,000,

41:23.485 --> 41:26.205
<i>it shows an ability to take</i>

41:23.485 --> 41:26.205
<i>on board feedback.</i>

41:26.245 --> 41:28.165
But equally

41:26.245 --> 41:28.165
there might be, sort of,

41:28.205 --> 41:30.085
<i>a slight lack</i>

41:28.205 --> 41:30.085
<i>of understanding</i>

41:30.125 --> 41:33.205
of the capital expenditure

41:30.125 --> 41:33.205
involved in opening

41:30.125 --> 41:33.205
a restaurant.

41:33.245 --> 41:34.685
[Shruti]<i> This is mine</i>

41:33.245 --> 41:34.685
<i>and my husband's money,</i>

41:34.725 --> 41:36.245
<i>we've worked hard for it.</i>

41:36.285 --> 41:38.245
To be convinced that

41:36.285 --> 41:38.245
we're going to give it

41:36.285 --> 41:38.245
to someone,

41:38.285 --> 41:39.965
they have to be

41:38.285 --> 41:39.965
extremely impressive

41:40.005 --> 41:41.245
<i>and they have to know</i>

41:40.005 --> 41:41.245
<i>what they're doing.</i>

41:41.565 --> 41:42.885
Hello.

41:42.925 --> 41:44.645
I'm not in the business

41:42.925 --> 41:44.645
of trying to catch her out,

41:44.685 --> 41:46.885
but at the same time

41:44.685 --> 41:46.885
if she wants £650,000,

41:46.925 --> 41:48.725
<i>I want her to convince me</i>

41:48.765 --> 41:52.405
that she is capable

41:48.765 --> 41:52.405
of managing the costs

41:48.765 --> 41:52.405
associated with a restaurant.

41:55.005 --> 41:58.005
Well done for last night,

41:55.005 --> 41:58.005
I thought it was delicious.

41:58.045 --> 42:00.005
I think one of the things

41:58.045 --> 42:00.005
that probably didn't go

41:58.045 --> 42:00.005
so well

42:00.045 --> 42:01.565
was the front of house.

42:01.605 --> 42:04.005
How would you be able

42:01.605 --> 42:04.005
to make that better?

42:01.605 --> 42:04.005
What's your plan?

42:04.045 --> 42:07.245
Everybody needs

42:04.045 --> 42:07.245
very clear roles and stations

42:07.285 --> 42:08.685
which they need to man.

42:08.725 --> 42:11.085
Obviously being thorough

42:08.725 --> 42:11.085
at the briefing stage is great,

42:11.125 --> 42:12.925
but it's about implementing

42:11.125 --> 42:12.925
that throughout the service.

42:14.685 --> 42:18.285
If you're in the kitchen,

42:14.685 --> 42:18.285
how do you see yourself

42:18.325 --> 42:20.565
sort of monitoring that

42:18.325 --> 42:20.565
front of house element?

42:20.605 --> 42:24.085
-I can't be

42:20.605 --> 42:24.085
in two places at once.

42:20.605 --> 42:24.085
-Exactly.

42:24.125 --> 42:25.885
So I definitely need

42:24.125 --> 42:25.885
to rejig the team

42:25.925 --> 42:28.085
and that's something that

42:25.925 --> 42:28.085
I definitely want to show

42:25.925 --> 42:28.085
you in service today.

42:28.125 --> 42:29.725
Great.

42:29.765 --> 42:31.885
I'm really hoping that

42:29.765 --> 42:31.885
the front of house plan

42:29.765 --> 42:31.885
does work today.

42:31.925 --> 42:33.685
<i>If I'm being</i>

42:31.925 --> 42:33.685
<i>completely honest,</i>

42:33.725 --> 42:35.445
<i>that did give me</i>

42:33.725 --> 42:35.445
<i>some alarm bells</i>

42:35.485 --> 42:36.965
<i>because ultimately,</i>

42:37.005 --> 42:39.005
it belies a little bit

42:37.005 --> 42:39.005
of a lack of understanding

42:39.045 --> 42:41.245
about how restaurant

42:39.045 --> 42:41.245
operations work.

42:42.405 --> 42:44.805
Right now,

42:42.405 --> 42:44.805
Tanya's in the deep end.

42:44.845 --> 42:48.285
The investors

42:44.845 --> 42:48.285
have big questions

42:44.845 --> 42:48.285
about her business plan.

42:48.325 --> 42:52.885
In it, she is aiming

42:48.325 --> 42:52.885
for an average spend

42:48.325 --> 42:52.885
of £30 per customer.

42:52.925 --> 42:55.725
But last night,

42:52.925 --> 42:55.725
she was way below

42:52.925 --> 42:55.725
that figure.

42:55.765 --> 42:57.565
She's got so much to do.

42:59.685 --> 43:02.205
Is there a reason why

42:59.685 --> 43:02.205
you've gone for

42:59.685 --> 43:02.205
the particular menu format?

43:02.245 --> 43:05.285
As a vegetarian,

43:02.245 --> 43:05.285
I very rarely have

43:02.245 --> 43:05.285
the opportunity

43:05.325 --> 43:06.925
-to eat everything

43:05.325 --> 43:06.925
on the menu.

43:05.325 --> 43:06.925
-Yeah.

43:06.965 --> 43:09.725
So I want people to eat

43:06.965 --> 43:09.725
and try as much as they

43:06.965 --> 43:09.725
possibly can.

43:09.765 --> 43:12.485
But the way that

43:09.765 --> 43:12.485
the portions were,

43:12.525 --> 43:16.285
actually the dishes

43:12.525 --> 43:16.285
are really quite large,

43:16.325 --> 43:18.285
and they don't

43:16.325 --> 43:18.285
allow you for that.

43:18.325 --> 43:20.205
-So, the portions

43:18.325 --> 43:20.205
need to be smaller.

43:18.325 --> 43:20.205
-Yeah.

43:20.245 --> 43:22.565
[Laura] Just thinking

43:20.245 --> 43:22.565
about it from a commercial

43:20.245 --> 43:22.565
perspective as well.

43:22.605 --> 43:23.565
If you're just

43:22.605 --> 43:23.565
going to fill them up,

43:23.605 --> 43:24.725
you're not going

43:23.605 --> 43:24.725
to hope to get

43:24.765 --> 43:26.325
-much more

43:24.765 --> 43:26.325
out of that customer.

43:24.765 --> 43:26.325
-Exactly.

43:26.365 --> 43:27.965
[Tanya] Coming from

43:26.365 --> 43:27.965
a street food background

43:28.005 --> 43:29.365
as well

43:28.005 --> 43:29.365
as an Indian background,

43:29.405 --> 43:32.245
it's all about hospitality,

43:29.405 --> 43:32.245
feeding, feeding, feeding.

43:32.285 --> 43:35.285
But one thing that

43:32.285 --> 43:35.285
we're definitely doing

43:32.285 --> 43:35.285
for this next service

43:35.325 --> 43:38.485
is we're changing

43:35.325 --> 43:38.485
the portion sizes,

43:35.325 --> 43:38.485
definitely.

43:38.525 --> 43:41.325
If you have

43:38.525 --> 43:41.325
the smaller dish notion,

43:41.365 --> 43:43.045
how are you going to get

43:41.365 --> 43:43.045
to the £30 per head?

43:43.085 --> 43:45.285
A £5 per small plate

43:43.085 --> 43:45.285
that requires

43:45.325 --> 43:49.165
each person to order

43:45.325 --> 43:49.165
six or five, you know.

43:49.205 --> 43:52.365
Dinner menu, I think,

43:49.205 --> 43:52.365
you can allow for lots

43:49.205 --> 43:52.365
of social eating,

43:52.405 --> 43:53.965
lots of small plates,

43:52.405 --> 43:53.965
lots of--

43:54.005 --> 43:56.765
But even then,

43:54.005 --> 43:56.765
expecting people to order six

43:56.805 --> 43:58.485
is quite a push.

43:56.805 --> 43:58.485
Between the two of us

43:58.525 --> 44:02.565
we'd have 12 small plates,

43:58.525 --> 44:02.565
it's just not realistic.

44:02.605 --> 44:06.485
In the realm of vegetarian,

44:02.605 --> 44:06.485
vegan food,

44:06.525 --> 44:08.965
you don't have that kind of

44:06.525 --> 44:08.965
cushion of being able to go,

44:09.005 --> 44:10.845
"Oh, right, I've put

44:09.005 --> 44:10.845
some langoustine on the menu,

44:10.885 --> 44:13.725
I've put some, like,

44:10.885 --> 44:13.725
rare breed beef,

44:13.765 --> 44:15.565
-and I can charge

44:13.765 --> 44:15.565
25 quid for that."

44:13.765 --> 44:15.565
-Yeah.

44:15.605 --> 44:18.445
I think £30 is going

44:15.605 --> 44:18.445
to be a bit too ambitious.

44:18.485 --> 44:20.725
Again, I didn't

44:20.765 --> 44:24.685
compute that this is actually

44:20.765 --> 44:24.685
a commercial restaurant

44:24.725 --> 44:26.045
and it's about the numbers.

44:26.085 --> 44:28.525
You want to increase

44:26.085 --> 44:28.525
that individual spend,

44:28.565 --> 44:30.405
and so that's a lot more

44:28.565 --> 44:30.405
clear to me now.

44:32.365 --> 44:35.405
Do you feel that

44:32.365 --> 44:35.405
it would be too big a leap

44:35.445 --> 44:37.605
to go straight

44:35.445 --> 44:37.605
from where you are now

44:37.645 --> 44:39.205
to opening a restaurant?

44:39.245 --> 44:42.165
You might be better served

44:39.245 --> 44:42.165
if you took some smaller

44:39.245 --> 44:42.165
steps first?

44:42.205 --> 44:43.605
Even though

44:42.205 --> 44:43.605
it is a bit of a leap,

44:43.645 --> 44:46.725
I don't think it's beyond us.

44:43.645 --> 44:46.725
I think it's achievable.

44:46.765 --> 44:48.965
I think this

44:46.765 --> 44:48.965
was the baby step, almost.

44:49.005 --> 44:50.725
I'm still slightly struggling

44:50.765 --> 44:52.685
with how you're going

44:50.765 --> 44:52.685
to make it profitable.

44:52.725 --> 44:54.565
You just need to be realistic.

44:55.685 --> 44:58.365
I think she is exactly

44:55.685 --> 44:58.365
the sort of person

44:58.405 --> 45:00.125
that the food industry needs,

45:00.165 --> 45:02.285
<i>she got lots of ideas,</i>

45:00.165 --> 45:02.285
<i>she's got a really great</i>

45:00.165 --> 45:02.285
<i>passion for food,</i>

45:02.325 --> 45:03.925
I just need to be convinced

45:03.965 --> 45:07.405
that she can rearrange

45:03.965 --> 45:07.405
her menu to make this

45:03.965 --> 45:07.405
profitable.

45:08.405 --> 45:09.645
[Laura] Tanya,

45:08.405 --> 45:09.645
what I'd love to see

45:09.685 --> 45:12.245
today at lunch is that

45:09.685 --> 45:12.245
you and your team

45:12.285 --> 45:14.325
have taken on board

45:12.285 --> 45:14.325
the feedback.

45:14.365 --> 45:16.805
I hope that it'll be a sort of

45:14.365 --> 45:16.805
smoother journey,

45:16.845 --> 45:18.805
I'm looking forward to having

45:16.845 --> 45:18.805
a good customer experience.

45:18.845 --> 45:21.485
[Laura] I would also like

45:18.845 --> 45:21.485
to see that you have

45:21.525 --> 45:24.125
tweaked the portion sizes,

45:21.525 --> 45:24.125
the pricing, et cetera.

45:24.165 --> 45:26.125
And wishing you the best

45:24.165 --> 45:26.125
of luck for the service.

45:26.165 --> 45:28.005
Thank you very much.

45:26.165 --> 45:28.005
Thank you.

45:28.045 --> 45:32.005
If I see a really

45:28.045 --> 45:32.005
well-oiled machine

45:28.045 --> 45:32.005
today at lunch,

45:32.045 --> 45:34.085
and, you know,

45:32.045 --> 45:34.085
mistakes happen.

45:34.125 --> 45:36.125
But corrected

45:34.125 --> 45:36.125
in a beautiful way,

45:36.165 --> 45:38.805
and the food executed

45:36.165 --> 45:38.805
really fantastically,

45:38.845 --> 45:42.925
then, yeah. I'm still

45:38.845 --> 45:42.925
keeping a very open mind

45:38.845 --> 45:42.925
about investment.

45:42.965 --> 45:44.925
[Tanya]<i> There's lots</i>

45:42.965 --> 45:44.925
<i>of different areas</i>

45:44.965 --> 45:47.925
that I'm not

45:44.965 --> 45:47.925
entirely sure about.

45:47.965 --> 45:50.525
Front of house,

45:47.965 --> 45:50.525
and how that works

45:47.965 --> 45:50.525
with the back of house.

45:50.565 --> 45:53.685
<i>So, it's given me a lot</i>

45:50.565 --> 45:53.685
<i>to really think about</i>

45:53.725 --> 45:55.405
and do some homework on,

45:55.445 --> 45:58.645
<i>because these</i>

45:55.445 --> 45:58.645
<i>are brand-new areas for me</i>

45:58.685 --> 46:00.885
<i>and I need to really</i>

45:58.685 --> 46:00.885
<i>conquer them.</i>

46:05.365 --> 46:06.725
-Hello, hello.

46:05.365 --> 46:06.725
-[Ross] Hello.

46:06.765 --> 46:08.085
[Raj] How did it go?

46:08.125 --> 46:09.645
[Tanya] Really interesting.

46:08.125 --> 46:09.645
I've got lots of feedback.

46:09.685 --> 46:12.725
I need to be a bit

46:09.685 --> 46:12.725
more involved.

46:12.765 --> 46:15.805
Making sure that

46:12.765 --> 46:15.805
front of house is working.

46:15.845 --> 46:19.085
They want to see

46:15.845 --> 46:19.085
how I envisage

46:19.125 --> 46:21.645
people spending

46:19.125 --> 46:21.645
a certain amount of money.

46:21.685 --> 46:23.605
So, like, 25 quid,

46:21.685 --> 46:23.605
30 quid or whatever.

46:23.645 --> 46:25.485
The portion sizes

46:23.645 --> 46:25.485
were way too big

46:25.525 --> 46:27.165
-for people to spend

46:25.525 --> 46:27.165
that much money.

46:25.525 --> 46:27.165
-[Ross] Yeah.

46:27.205 --> 46:28.805
[Tanya] Everything's

46:27.205 --> 46:28.805
gonna be smaller.

46:28.845 --> 46:30.245
So, I'm going to have to do

46:28.845 --> 46:30.245
a little bit of work

46:28.845 --> 46:30.245
on the laptop,

46:30.285 --> 46:32.445
make changes

46:30.285 --> 46:32.445
to the menu. Cool.

46:32.485 --> 46:33.365
[Ross] Go team.

46:33.405 --> 46:35.005
[all] Go team. Yeah.

46:36.605 --> 46:39.685
The investors want

46:36.605 --> 46:39.685
to back ideas that

46:36.605 --> 46:39.685
will grow.

46:39.725 --> 46:41.405
And the big question remains,

46:41.445 --> 46:45.005
can a meat-free restaurant

46:41.445 --> 46:45.005
do enough business to thrive?

46:45.045 --> 46:46.285
The signs are good.

46:46.325 --> 46:48.445
Nearly a third

46:46.325 --> 46:48.445
of the UK population

46:48.485 --> 46:50.245
has cut down on meat

46:48.485 --> 46:50.245
in the last six months.

46:51.925 --> 46:53.885
[Tanya] Less quantity

46:51.925 --> 46:53.885
than yesterday.

46:53.925 --> 46:55.965
[Fred]<i> Tanya's got everyone</i>

46:53.925 --> 46:55.965
<i>working on the changes</i>

46:56.005 --> 46:58.525
<i>that she's hoping</i>

46:56.005 --> 46:58.525
<i>will impress the investors.</i>

46:58.565 --> 47:00.245
We tend to pile it on.

47:00.285 --> 47:03.245
-You know, it's part of Indian

47:00.285 --> 47:03.245
culture, and Asian culture.

47:00.285 --> 47:03.245
-It is.

47:03.285 --> 47:05.605
[Fred]<i> While she tries</i>

47:03.285 --> 47:05.605
<i>to find the magic formula</i>

47:05.645 --> 47:10.365
<i>for portion size and price</i>

47:05.645 --> 47:10.365
<i>to deliver a better spend</i>

47:05.645 --> 47:10.365
<i>per head.</i>

47:10.405 --> 47:14.885
I've made a bold decision

47:10.405 --> 47:14.885
to change all of my menu

47:14.925 --> 47:15.845
<i>to small plates.</i>

47:18.165 --> 47:19.525
How are you, Tanya?

47:19.565 --> 47:21.085
-Not so bad, thank you.

47:19.565 --> 47:21.085
-Good, good.

47:21.125 --> 47:22.765
So, what have

47:21.125 --> 47:22.765
you changed?

47:22.805 --> 47:24.445
Quite a bit actually,

47:22.805 --> 47:24.445
quite a bit.

47:24.485 --> 47:27.045
So, in fact the menu,

47:24.485 --> 47:27.045
we've gone small plates.

47:27.085 --> 47:29.685
-[Fred] Very good.

47:27.085 --> 47:29.685
-Portions are all

47:27.085 --> 47:29.685
a lot smaller.

47:29.725 --> 47:31.165
We're encouraging

47:29.725 --> 47:31.165
people to order--

47:31.205 --> 47:32.445
And you've changed

47:31.205 --> 47:32.445
your prices.

47:32.485 --> 47:33.685
[Tanya] Changed the prices,

47:32.485 --> 47:33.685
changed the portion.

47:33.725 --> 47:35.725
[Fred] I think you

47:33.725 --> 47:35.725
are on a winning...

47:35.765 --> 47:38.565
-Hopefully. Don't get

47:35.765 --> 47:38.565
me too excited.

47:35.765 --> 47:38.565
-Well done, that's very good.

47:38.605 --> 47:40.965
I feel very calm.

47:38.605 --> 47:40.965
I'm channeling

47:38.605 --> 47:40.965
my inner zen.

47:41.005 --> 47:43.285
[Fred] Raj, remember,

47:41.005 --> 47:43.285
it's all about the efficiency

47:43.325 --> 47:44.645
when you're

47:43.325 --> 47:44.645
at reception there.

47:44.685 --> 47:47.285
You've got to be so fast.

47:44.685 --> 47:47.285
In and out like a ghost.

47:47.325 --> 47:49.445
-All right?

47:47.325 --> 47:49.445
-[Raj] Yep. Thanks, Fred.

47:49.485 --> 47:51.045
[Raj]<i> Fred's advice</i>

47:49.485 --> 47:51.045
<i>is very helpful.</i>

47:51.085 --> 47:53.325
Obviously because he's

47:51.085 --> 47:53.325
got years of knowledge

47:51.085 --> 47:53.325
and experience.

47:56.205 --> 48:00.645
It's two o'clock,

47:56.205 --> 48:00.645
we're open for business

47:56.205 --> 48:00.645
for second service.

48:00.685 --> 48:02.645
Go team!

48:02.685 --> 48:05.365
[Fred]<i> Devi's first customers</i>

48:02.685 --> 48:05.365
<i>have arrived for lunch.</i>

48:05.405 --> 48:07.725
[Raj] Hello, good afternoon.

48:05.405 --> 48:07.725
Hi, how are you?

48:07.765 --> 48:12.245
[Fred]<i> They'll pay full price,</i>

48:07.765 --> 48:12.245
<i>so there is absolutely</i>

48:07.765 --> 48:12.245
<i>no room for error.</i>

48:12.285 --> 48:13.885
[Fred] Say hello,

48:12.285 --> 48:13.885
how are you.

48:13.925 --> 48:15.445
Make sure that

48:13.925 --> 48:15.445
people feel special.

48:15.485 --> 48:18.285
Give them a smile,

48:15.485 --> 48:18.285
pay attention. Focus,

48:18.325 --> 48:19.965
and go from one place

48:18.325 --> 48:19.965
to another.

48:20.005 --> 48:21.805
-Boom, boom, boom, boom.

48:20.005 --> 48:21.805
-Yeah.

48:21.845 --> 48:24.365
Welcome to Devi's,

48:21.845 --> 48:24.365
can I take a name please?

48:24.405 --> 48:26.125
So far, the service looks

48:24.405 --> 48:26.125
better than yesterday.

48:26.165 --> 48:28.685
But the service just started.

48:26.165 --> 48:28.685
So, it's early days.

48:31.965 --> 48:33.245
[Fred]<i> Laura and Shruti</i>

48:33.285 --> 48:35.965
<i>will want to see</i>

48:33.285 --> 48:35.965
<i>a very different Devi's</i>

48:36.005 --> 48:39.125
<i>if they're going to seriously</i>

48:36.005 --> 48:39.125
<i>consider investing tonight.</i>

48:40.605 --> 48:41.925
[Shruti]<i> I think</i>

48:40.605 --> 48:41.925
<i>if Tanya can show</i>

48:41.965 --> 48:45.445
that she has put some thought

48:41.965 --> 48:45.445
into the portion sizes

48:45.485 --> 48:47.325
and how much she's going

48:45.485 --> 48:47.325
to be able to make

48:45.485 --> 48:47.325
on each dish,

48:47.365 --> 48:48.805
<i>and how much people</i>

48:47.365 --> 48:48.805
<i>need to order,</i>

48:48.845 --> 48:50.845
<i>then there's still a really</i>

48:48.845 --> 48:50.845
<i>good chance of investment.</i>

48:50.885 --> 48:52.845
-Hello, how are you?

48:50.885 --> 48:52.845
-Very well, thank you.

48:50.885 --> 48:52.845
Good to see you again.

48:52.885 --> 48:55.685
-How's it going?

48:52.885 --> 48:55.685
-Very well so far.

48:52.885 --> 48:55.685
Calm but collected.

48:57.045 --> 49:00.205
[Fred]<i> First, an explanation</i>

48:57.045 --> 49:00.205
<i>of Tanya's new menu.</i>

49:00.245 --> 49:01.445
[Flo] They're all

49:00.245 --> 49:01.445
small plates...

49:01.485 --> 49:03.445
So how many would you

49:01.485 --> 49:03.445
recommend for one person?

49:03.485 --> 49:05.085
For one, I would have

49:03.485 --> 49:05.085
three to four.

49:05.125 --> 49:06.365
-[Shruti] Even for lunch?

49:05.125 --> 49:06.365
-Yep.

49:09.205 --> 49:10.885
We've got

49:09.205 --> 49:10.885
Shruti in already.

49:10.925 --> 49:13.965
And I haven't seen Laura yet

49:10.925 --> 49:13.965
but I'm sure I will soon.

49:15.445 --> 49:17.125
I think what I really

49:15.445 --> 49:17.125
want to see today,

49:17.165 --> 49:19.965
to convince myself that

49:17.165 --> 49:19.965
this is an investable concept,

49:20.005 --> 49:22.085
<i>is that Tanya has taken</i>

49:20.005 --> 49:22.085
<i>on board the feedback</i>

49:22.125 --> 49:24.205
<i>in relation</i>

49:22.125 --> 49:24.205
<i>to the understanding that</i>

49:24.245 --> 49:26.725
we need to make this

49:24.245 --> 49:26.725
a viable business somehow.

49:26.765 --> 49:29.165
-[Raj] So you're going

49:26.765 --> 49:29.165
to be sitting here actually.

49:26.765 --> 49:29.165
-[Laura] Okay. Great.

49:29.205 --> 49:31.045
[Flo] So, things are slightly

49:29.205 --> 49:31.045
different today.

49:31.085 --> 49:32.045
[Laura] Yeah, okay.

49:32.085 --> 49:33.285
[Flo] Wine menu

49:32.085 --> 49:33.285
remains the same

49:33.325 --> 49:34.965
and everything

49:33.325 --> 49:34.965
is a small dish now.

49:35.005 --> 49:36.205
Okay.

49:36.245 --> 49:38.685
The hospitality

49:36.245 --> 49:38.685
was so much better.

49:38.725 --> 49:40.765
So, coming in,

49:38.725 --> 49:40.765
getting sat down.

49:40.805 --> 49:43.285
She has taken on board

49:40.805 --> 49:43.285
so much of the feedback.

49:44.965 --> 49:46.965
I am incredibly

49:44.965 --> 49:46.965
impressed with Tanya,

49:47.005 --> 49:49.325
<i>because she has changed</i>

49:47.005 --> 49:49.325
<i>the menu quite significantly</i>

49:49.365 --> 49:50.805
<i>in a really</i>

49:49.365 --> 49:50.805
<i>short period of time.</i>

49:50.845 --> 49:52.605
And that shows

49:50.845 --> 49:52.605
willing, determination

49:52.645 --> 49:55.085
and, you know,

49:52.645 --> 49:55.085
it's fantastic to see.

49:55.125 --> 49:56.285
[Raj] A favorite dish?

49:56.325 --> 49:57.685
-That one.

49:56.325 --> 49:57.685
-The butternut squash?

49:57.725 --> 49:59.565
That's been

49:57.725 --> 49:59.565
very popular actually.

49:59.605 --> 50:01.005
-[Tanya] Hi.

49:59.605 --> 50:01.005
-How are you?

50:01.045 --> 50:03.085
-I'm okay, how are you?

50:01.045 --> 50:03.085
-Good, good.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.725
Good. So, I've been making

50:03.125 --> 50:05.725
more of a conscious effort

50:05.765 --> 50:07.245
to come out and speak

50:05.765 --> 50:07.245
to all the diners

50:07.285 --> 50:08.885
-from the very beginning

50:07.285 --> 50:08.885
of service.

50:07.285 --> 50:08.885
-Yeah.

50:08.925 --> 50:10.445
Oh, fantastic.

50:10.485 --> 50:12.165
She, I think, is much

50:10.485 --> 50:12.165
more engaged.

50:12.205 --> 50:13.645
She's looking around,

50:12.205 --> 50:13.645
she looks calm,

50:13.685 --> 50:15.245
she looks much more

50:13.685 --> 50:15.245
in control.

50:15.285 --> 50:17.365
Given that this is only

50:15.285 --> 50:17.365
her second time

50:17.405 --> 50:19.405
running a restaurant,

50:17.405 --> 50:19.405
I think she's doing

50:17.405 --> 50:19.405
incredibly well.

50:19.445 --> 50:21.485
How many are you

50:19.445 --> 50:21.485
telling people to order?

50:21.525 --> 50:25.365
For a table of two,

50:21.525 --> 50:25.365
for example, we would

50:21.525 --> 50:25.365
say four to five plates.

50:25.405 --> 50:27.165
That's fantastic.

50:25.405 --> 50:27.165
Great, I'm really

50:25.405 --> 50:27.165
looking forward to it.

50:28.485 --> 50:29.725
[Shruti] Thank you very much.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.165
[Fred]<i> They've nailed</i>

50:29.765 --> 50:31.165
<i>front of house</i>

50:31.205 --> 50:33.645
<i>and they are tackling orders</i>

50:31.205 --> 50:33.645
<i>as they come in</i>

50:33.685 --> 50:36.205
Kale and dill pakoras

50:33.685 --> 50:36.205
for table 16.

50:36.245 --> 50:38.405
Kale and dill pakoras

50:36.245 --> 50:38.405
for table number five.

50:38.445 --> 50:40.285
[Tanya]<i> We are banging out</i>

50:38.445 --> 50:40.285
<i>lots of plates</i>

50:40.325 --> 50:41.965
across lots

50:40.325 --> 50:41.965
of different tables.

50:42.005 --> 50:43.805
<i>Clearing tickets</i>

50:42.005 --> 50:43.805
<i>very quickly.</i>

50:43.845 --> 50:46.685
Table seven and 13.

50:43.845 --> 50:46.685
They're both gone

50:43.845 --> 50:46.685
now, yeah?

50:48.445 --> 50:50.445
[Ross] I have to say,

50:48.445 --> 50:50.445
Fred was actually right.

50:50.485 --> 50:53.525
I know, I know. I'm really

50:50.485 --> 50:53.525
annoyed that he was right.

50:53.565 --> 50:54.845
[Ross] I knew he was right.

50:55.405 --> 50:56.645
[Tanya] Yeah.

50:56.685 --> 50:58.125
Just thought I'd come

50:56.685 --> 50:58.125
and see how you're going.

50:58.165 --> 50:59.565
[Ross] Smoother

50:58.165 --> 50:59.565
than yesterday.

50:59.605 --> 51:01.445
I got my first plate

50:59.605 --> 51:01.445
so quickly.

51:01.485 --> 51:03.685
Oh, brilliant. Thanks.

51:01.485 --> 51:03.685
We're taking Fred's

51:01.485 --> 51:03.685
advice as well.

51:03.725 --> 51:04.565
[Laura] Yay.

51:07.925 --> 51:10.925
[Fred]<i> But for some,</i>

51:07.925 --> 51:10.925
<i>the food is lacking bite.</i>

51:10.965 --> 51:13.285
[Shruti] So, I don't think

51:10.965 --> 51:13.285
the food is perfect.

51:13.325 --> 51:16.605
Like, sort of, a brown sludgy

51:13.325 --> 51:16.605
looking thing here,

51:16.645 --> 51:19.205
and then another brown

51:16.645 --> 51:19.205
sludgy looking thing here.

51:19.245 --> 51:21.525
And a big puddle of liquid.

51:19.245 --> 51:21.525
The whole thing

51:21.565 --> 51:23.805
just needs a bit more

51:21.565 --> 51:23.805
crunch and texture.

51:23.845 --> 51:25.965
-Shruti, how are you?

51:23.845 --> 51:25.965
-Fred.

51:26.005 --> 51:28.325
-Well, you've ordered a lot.

51:26.005 --> 51:28.325
-[laughs]

51:28.365 --> 51:30.045
What do you think today?

51:30.085 --> 51:32.885
I think that she is great.

51:30.085 --> 51:32.885
That she's calm

51:30.085 --> 51:32.885
and she's collected,

51:32.925 --> 51:34.805
-and she's run

51:32.925 --> 51:34.805
a much better service.

51:32.925 --> 51:34.805
-[Fred] You know what,

51:34.845 --> 51:36.205
I'm very impressed

51:34.845 --> 51:36.205
with her today.

51:36.245 --> 51:37.605
She listened

51:36.245 --> 51:37.605
to your comments,

51:37.645 --> 51:40.245
she listened to your feedback

51:37.645 --> 51:40.245
and she acted upon them.

51:40.285 --> 51:42.325
Absolutely. She's got

51:40.285 --> 51:42.325
a great attitude.

51:42.365 --> 51:43.965
And I actually love

51:42.365 --> 51:43.965
what she's trying to do.

51:44.005 --> 51:48.285
My one criticism is actually,

51:44.005 --> 51:48.285
if you look at this

51:44.005 --> 51:48.285
on the table

51:48.325 --> 51:52.085
that the food is a bit

51:48.325 --> 51:52.085
puree-like and sloppy.

51:52.125 --> 51:53.965
-Baby food?

51:52.125 --> 51:53.965
-Baby food.

51:54.005 --> 51:56.485
Well, look. I'm sure you've

51:54.005 --> 51:56.485
got a lot to think about.

51:56.525 --> 51:58.165
I'm going to give

51:56.525 --> 51:58.165
you a deadline,

51:58.205 --> 52:00.565
you have until

51:58.205 --> 52:00.565
seven o'clock tonight

52:00.605 --> 52:01.885
to come back

52:00.605 --> 52:01.885
and make them an offer.

52:01.925 --> 52:03.525
I'm going to leave you

52:01.925 --> 52:03.525
and enjoy your meal.

52:03.565 --> 52:04.885
-[Shruti] Thank you.

52:03.565 --> 52:04.885
-And think.

52:04.925 --> 52:05.885
-Always nice to see you.

52:04.925 --> 52:05.885
-Good luck.

52:05.925 --> 52:06.765
-Thank you.

52:05.925 --> 52:06.765
-Take care.

52:08.645 --> 52:10.685
Switching to small plates

52:08.645 --> 52:10.685
was a really good shout

52:10.725 --> 52:14.405
because it means that

52:10.725 --> 52:14.405
everybody can try

52:10.725 --> 52:14.405
a bit of everything.

52:14.445 --> 52:16.685
And I've actually had

52:14.445 --> 52:16.685
customers already say

52:16.725 --> 52:18.605
that that was a really

52:16.725 --> 52:18.605
good shout.

52:18.645 --> 52:20.765
I've got two bhajis,

52:18.645 --> 52:20.765
I've got one more coming.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.125
-Laura, how are you, Laura?

52:20.805 --> 52:22.125
-Mmm.

52:22.165 --> 52:23.365
Do you mind if I join you?

52:23.405 --> 52:25.365
-How are you? Good.

52:23.405 --> 52:25.365
-I'm very well, thank you.

52:25.405 --> 52:27.525
-How's your lunch?

52:25.405 --> 52:27.525
-Very interesting today.

52:27.565 --> 52:30.445
I'm really excited

52:27.565 --> 52:30.445
by the fact that,

52:27.565 --> 52:30.445
you know, now customers

52:30.485 --> 52:33.165
are going to get to try

52:30.485 --> 52:33.165
a whole spectrum

52:30.485 --> 52:33.165
of different plates

52:33.205 --> 52:34.685
as opposed to being

52:33.205 --> 52:34.685
told by your waiter

52:34.725 --> 52:36.725
to only order two plates

52:34.725 --> 52:36.725
and share a main.

52:36.765 --> 52:39.365
I think, concept-wise,

52:36.765 --> 52:39.365
it feels a lot more exciting.

52:39.405 --> 52:42.205
-You need to decide

52:39.405 --> 52:42.205
whether you want to invest.

52:39.405 --> 52:42.205
-I do.

52:42.245 --> 52:43.765
So, you've got to do that

52:42.245 --> 52:43.765
before tonight.

52:43.805 --> 52:46.165
I do. I've got

52:43.805 --> 52:46.165
a lot to think about.

52:46.205 --> 52:47.645
-Good luck.

52:46.205 --> 52:47.645
See you later.

52:46.205 --> 52:47.645
-Thank you, Fred.

52:49.565 --> 52:52.365
[Shruti]<i> I think she</i>

52:49.565 --> 52:52.365
<i>has done fantastically well.</i>

52:52.405 --> 52:54.805
She's really engaging,

52:52.405 --> 52:54.805
she's ambitious.

52:54.845 --> 52:57.285
<i>Does that mean that</i>

52:54.845 --> 52:57.285
<i>she can run a restaurant?</i>

52:57.325 --> 52:59.725
I don't know. My heart

52:57.325 --> 52:59.725
is telling me one thing

52:59.765 --> 53:01.725
and my head

52:59.765 --> 53:01.725
is telling me another.

53:01.765 --> 53:03.085
Thank you. Really good.

53:01.765 --> 53:03.085
Did you enjoy it?

53:03.125 --> 53:04.925
-Beautiful, thank you.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.925
-Fantastic. Thank you.

53:04.965 --> 53:07.805
So, I was so impressed

53:04.965 --> 53:07.805
with lunch today.

53:07.845 --> 53:09.565
It really, really excited me,

53:09.605 --> 53:12.765
the way that Tanya had

53:09.605 --> 53:12.765
turned her team around.

53:12.805 --> 53:15.365
<i>Now, are we at a stage</i>

53:12.805 --> 53:15.365
<i>where we're ready</i>

53:15.405 --> 53:19.005
<i>for her business to be</i>

53:15.405 --> 53:19.005
<i>a really, really viable</i>

53:15.405 --> 53:19.005
<i>concept</i>

53:19.045 --> 53:20.165
that is going to get

53:19.045 --> 53:20.165
enough traction,

53:20.205 --> 53:22.045
enough customers

53:20.205 --> 53:22.045
through the door?

53:22.085 --> 53:23.805
That's the big question mark

53:22.085 --> 53:23.805
I've got.

53:23.845 --> 53:29.525
I've learnt a lot. The menu

53:23.845 --> 53:29.525
has to be really tailored

53:23.845 --> 53:29.525
to the offering.

53:29.565 --> 53:32.845
And that's something I really

53:29.565 --> 53:32.845
underestimated as well.

53:32.885 --> 53:34.885
[Ross] We need to forget

53:32.885 --> 53:34.885
about the street food concept.

53:34.925 --> 53:37.205
Yeah, we really do.

53:34.925 --> 53:37.205
It's different.

53:34.925 --> 53:37.205
It's new territory.

53:43.165 --> 53:47.525
[Fred]<i> Lunch is over.</i>

53:43.165 --> 53:47.525
<i>Now all Tanya can do</i>

53:43.165 --> 53:47.525
<i>is wait.</i>

53:49.085 --> 53:52.685
<i>She's looking for £650,000</i>

53:52.725 --> 53:55.445
<i>to build her dream</i>

53:52.725 --> 53:55.445
<i>of a restaurant.</i>

53:55.485 --> 53:58.125
<i>Laura and Shruti have</i>

53:55.485 --> 53:58.125
<i>a deadline of seven o'clock</i>

53:58.165 --> 54:01.165
<i>to return with an offer</i>

53:58.165 --> 54:01.165
<i>of an investment.</i>

54:01.205 --> 54:02.285
Tanya, how are you?

54:03.125 --> 54:04.405
Just wondering.

54:04.445 --> 54:07.525
Just trying to stay

54:04.445 --> 54:07.525
very balanced,

54:07.565 --> 54:10.245
'cause I'm very aware

54:07.565 --> 54:10.245
it could go either way.

54:10.285 --> 54:12.885
[Fred]<i> If more than one</i>

54:10.285 --> 54:12.885
<i>investor returns,</i>

54:12.925 --> 54:15.005
<i>Tanya will have to choose</i>

54:12.925 --> 54:15.005
<i>between offers.</i>

54:15.045 --> 54:16.805
Thank you, thank you.

54:16.845 --> 54:19.725
[Fred]<i> But if no one</i>

54:16.845 --> 54:19.725
<i>comes in, she'll be back</i>

54:16.845 --> 54:19.725
<i>to her street stall.</i>

54:26.005 --> 54:27.485
What will it mean

54:26.005 --> 54:27.485
to you if you got it?

54:29.125 --> 54:30.885
It would be just...

54:30.925 --> 54:35.605
Just incredible.

54:30.925 --> 54:35.605
To actually win

54:30.925 --> 54:35.605
the investment.

54:35.645 --> 54:39.525
Well, that's just

54:35.645 --> 54:39.525
entirely crazy. [laughs]

55:05.085 --> 55:06.605
Tanya,

55:06.645 --> 55:08.565
-the deadline has passed.

55:06.645 --> 55:08.565
-Mmm-hmm.

55:08.605 --> 55:09.845
The investors

55:08.605 --> 55:09.845
are not coming.

55:09.885 --> 55:10.765
Okay.

55:10.805 --> 55:12.325
-[Fred] I'm sorry.

55:10.805 --> 55:12.325
-It's okay.

55:12.365 --> 55:13.845
How do you feel?

55:13.885 --> 55:17.645
With what I knew at the time,

55:13.885 --> 55:17.645
I did what I thought was best.

55:17.685 --> 55:19.725
I mean, for me this has

55:17.685 --> 55:19.725
actually been quite difficult

55:19.765 --> 55:22.765
as a decision

55:19.765 --> 55:22.765
because I like her so much.

55:22.805 --> 55:24.805
<i>But as an angel investor,</i>

55:24.845 --> 55:26.645
one of the key things

55:24.845 --> 55:26.645
that I look for

55:26.685 --> 55:29.525
is whether or not a founder

55:26.685 --> 55:29.525
will be able to stand

55:26.685 --> 55:29.525
on their own two feet.

55:29.565 --> 55:31.965
<i>I'm just not sure that</i>

55:29.565 --> 55:31.965
<i>she's got the experience</i>

55:32.005 --> 55:34.245
which is why I don't think

55:32.005 --> 55:34.245
I can invest in her.

55:34.285 --> 55:35.885
I think you should

55:34.285 --> 55:35.885
be proud of yourself.

55:35.925 --> 55:39.245
You came here with drive,

55:35.925 --> 55:39.245
with energy, with passion.

55:39.285 --> 55:41.845
And there were errors

55:39.285 --> 55:41.845
on the first day,

55:41.885 --> 55:44.445
but today you adapted,

55:41.885 --> 55:44.445
you changed.

55:44.485 --> 55:46.045
You couldn't have

55:44.485 --> 55:46.045
done better.

55:46.085 --> 55:47.645
-You know,

55:46.085 --> 55:47.645
you've learnt so much.

55:46.085 --> 55:47.645
-[footsteps approaching]

55:51.205 --> 55:52.725
-Laura.

55:51.205 --> 55:52.725
-Hi.

55:52.765 --> 55:55.165
Laura, you've missed

55:52.765 --> 55:55.165
the deadline by three minutes.

55:55.205 --> 55:57.765
I know. I know I have.

55:57.805 --> 55:59.045
This is cheeky.

55:59.085 --> 56:00.405
[laughing]

56:01.525 --> 56:02.565
What's going on?

56:02.605 --> 56:04.365
-So...

56:02.605 --> 56:04.365
-Hi.

56:04.405 --> 56:07.285
Tanya, I don't have

56:04.405 --> 56:07.285
a formal offer to make today.

56:08.725 --> 56:10.565
Your food is incredible,

56:10.605 --> 56:14.405
and I think your passion

56:10.605 --> 56:14.405
and who you are

56:10.605 --> 56:14.405
is absolutely fantastic.

56:14.445 --> 56:16.285
And I've been so impressed.

56:16.325 --> 56:19.445
How you've taken

56:16.325 --> 56:19.445
on board all the feedback

56:16.325 --> 56:19.445
and turned things around.

56:21.485 --> 56:23.765
But look, what I'm here

56:21.485 --> 56:23.765
to discuss with you

56:25.805 --> 56:27.565
is that I would love

56:25.805 --> 56:27.565
to mentor you.

56:30.485 --> 56:33.845
To hopefully help you

56:30.485 --> 56:33.845
get to a place where,

56:33.885 --> 56:36.405
in the future,

56:33.885 --> 56:36.405
me and, you know,

56:33.885 --> 56:36.405
my investment team

56:36.445 --> 56:39.685
and other people might want

56:36.445 --> 56:39.685
to invest in the concept.

56:36.445 --> 56:39.685
And in you.

56:39.725 --> 56:43.165
-Yep. That sounds

56:39.725 --> 56:43.165
absolutely wonderful to me.

56:39.725 --> 56:43.165
-Yeah.

56:43.205 --> 56:44.805
Sorry, it's just, ah...

56:44.845 --> 56:47.205
Yeah. I would be absolutely

56:44.845 --> 56:47.205
delighted to help you

56:47.245 --> 56:50.325
on your journey to get

56:47.245 --> 56:50.325
to opening a restaurant.

56:50.365 --> 56:51.645
-Nice. High five.

56:50.365 --> 56:51.645
-Yeah!

56:53.325 --> 56:55.165
Thank you. Gosh.

56:55.205 --> 56:58.005
<i>It's just...</i>

56:55.205 --> 56:58.005
<i>It's just remarkable.</i>

56:58.045 --> 56:59.725
<i>It's very surreal actually.</i>

56:59.765 --> 57:01.045
It's great.

57:01.085 --> 57:03.125
This whole experience

57:01.085 --> 57:03.125
has shown me

57:03.165 --> 57:04.725
how much I don't

57:03.165 --> 57:04.725
actually know.

57:04.765 --> 57:07.805
I haven't done anything

57:04.765 --> 57:07.805
like this before.

57:07.845 --> 57:09.285
-There's lots that

57:07.845 --> 57:09.285
I hadn't thought about...

57:07.845 --> 57:09.285
-Yeah.

57:09.325 --> 57:10.965
...and I really was not ready.

57:11.005 --> 57:15.885
So, mentorship

57:11.005 --> 57:15.885
of your caliber

57:11.005 --> 57:15.885
would be fantastic.

57:15.925 --> 57:17.525
[Laura]<i> I definitely think</i>

57:15.925 --> 57:17.525
<i>there could be a Devi's.</i>

57:17.565 --> 57:19.485
<i>I'm not sure when,</i>

57:17.565 --> 57:19.485
<i>I'm not sure how.</i>

57:19.525 --> 57:20.845
<i>But, you know,</i>

57:19.525 --> 57:20.845
<i>I'd like to think that,</i>

57:20.885 --> 57:23.205
you know, Devi's one day

57:20.885 --> 57:23.205
can become a reality.

57:23.245 --> 57:25.285
-[Laura and Tanya] Cheers.

57:23.245 --> 57:25.285
-Well done. Well done.

57:26.005 --> 57:27.605
Cheers.

57:27.645 --> 57:30.525
[Tanya]<i> I really,</i>

57:27.645 --> 57:30.525
<i>really admire Laura</i>

57:30.565 --> 57:32.005
<i>as a business woman</i>

57:30.565 --> 57:32.005
<i>and as a person.</i>

57:32.045 --> 57:34.285
I think it could be

57:32.045 --> 57:34.285
an incredible collaboration.

57:34.325 --> 57:35.605
[Laura]<i> I am</i>

57:34.325 --> 57:35.605
<i>a passionate believer</i>

57:35.645 --> 57:37.485
<i>in promoting women</i>

57:35.645 --> 57:37.485
<i>in business.</i>

57:37.525 --> 57:40.605
You know,

57:37.525 --> 57:40.605
we are underrepresented

57:37.525 --> 57:40.605
at founder level,

57:40.645 --> 57:42.845
at board level,

57:40.645 --> 57:42.845
at senior levels

57:40.645 --> 57:42.845
of management.

57:42.885 --> 57:44.965
<i>But they have</i>

57:42.885 --> 57:44.965
<i>to be the right women.</i>

57:45.005 --> 57:46.605
They've gotta be women

57:45.005 --> 57:46.605
who are, like,

57:46.645 --> 57:48.445
really passionate

57:46.645 --> 57:48.445
and know their stuff.

57:49.205 --> 57:50.565
Hello.

57:50.605 --> 57:52.885
-Shall I put you

57:50.605 --> 57:52.885
out of your misery?

57:50.605 --> 57:52.885
-Yes, please.

57:52.925 --> 57:54.125
[Ross] How did it go?

57:54.165 --> 57:57.325
She would like

57:54.165 --> 57:57.325
to offer mentorship

57:57.365 --> 57:59.525
with the ultimate goal

57:57.365 --> 57:59.525
of investment.

58:00.085 --> 58:01.765
[all cheering]

58:07.765 --> 58:10.005
Tanya did not get

58:07.765 --> 58:10.005
the investment she wanted,

58:10.045 --> 58:12.325
but instead she got

58:10.045 --> 58:12.325
what she really needed,

58:12.365 --> 58:13.965
a priceless mentorship.

58:14.005 --> 58:15.925
And with Laura by her side,

58:15.965 --> 58:18.085
I am sure we will hear

58:15.965 --> 58:18.085
from her very soon again.

58:22.685 --> 58:25.245
There's not a massive demand

58:22.685 --> 58:25.245
for Burmese cooking.

58:25.285 --> 58:26.725
My mom makes

58:25.285 --> 58:26.725
the best mohinga.

58:26.765 --> 58:29.045
We believe you,

58:26.765 --> 58:29.045
the proof's in the pudding.

58:29.085 --> 58:31.205
It appeals to a broad

58:29.085 --> 58:31.205
demographic, rice.

58:31.245 --> 58:32.925
The economics

58:31.245 --> 58:32.925
might be quite attractive.

58:32.965 --> 58:35.525
I disagree with you,

58:32.965 --> 58:35.525
I did not like the product.

58:35.565 --> 58:39.085
[Jamie] Bao is what

58:35.565 --> 58:39.085
their whole product

58:35.565 --> 58:39.085
is based upon,

58:39.125 --> 58:40.925
and their bao bun

58:39.125 --> 58:40.925
was not good enough.
