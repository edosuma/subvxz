00:24.725 --> 00:28.962
I do not want to be the star
of your ad campaign.

Are you ashamed
of your ASD?

00:30.631 --> 00:31.699
No.
Good.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.735
It's amazing
what you've accomplished.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.439
Think of all the neurodiverse
people you'll inspire.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.209
The billboard
will inspire no one.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.843
It is not fair
to use my picture,

00:42.976 --> 00:44.745
and it inverts my image.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.580
My hair part is
on the wrong side.

You're emotional.
I'm right.

between one and ten.

I do not understand
what you think that proves.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.500
I am constantly revisiting
earlier decisions.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.569
Then you should revisit
your decision

01:08.702 --> 01:10.171
to put up the billboard.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.073
I will.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.144
But you need to do
the same.

of the issue.

DR. ANDREWS: Representation's
important, Shaun.

Only 4% of doctors
are Black.

I get my face out there
whenever I can.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.825
This isn't
representation.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.227
It's tokenism.
Nah.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.496
She's not hiring more
diverse doctors.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.698
She's just
exploiting the ones
who already work here.

Initial impressions
of a patient's condition

Dr. Murphy, there's
a new patient's dad
asking to see you.

demanding.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.050
Oh, no. (SIGHS)

02:02.523 --> 02:04.458
If you asked for me because
I was on a billboard,

02:04.592 --> 02:06.460
that is not a good metric
for picking a...

02:06.594 --> 02:10.631
No, my metric is that
you co-authored 23 papers,

02:10.764 --> 02:14.402
eight on pediatric surgeries,
four on GI issues.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.404
This is my girl,

to the bathroom.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.076
Now, I'm sure
it's visceral myopathy.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.579
You've seen 19 doctors.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.748
Have any diagnosed
visceral myopathy?

02:27.881 --> 02:30.318
They said inflammatory bowel,
but it's not.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.952
She keeps getting
sicker and sicker.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.789
Hmm, your abdomen
is distended.

Have you been vomiting?

02:37.225 --> 02:38.726
Worse than ever.

This doesn't seem to be
a surgical case.

I'll admit you
to internal medicine...

02:42.230 --> 02:44.832
I've done a lot of reading.
It's visceral...

02:44.965 --> 02:48.836
Visceral myopathy doesn't fit
her symptoms well,

02:48.969 --> 02:52.240

on the Internet
is very unreliable.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.947

37:01.620 --> 37:05.757
Yes, uh, well, um...
uh, indeed.

37:05.891 --> 37:10.228
I am, uh, using
my custom fitness tracker

37:10.362 --> 37:14.700
because healthy doctors
make healthy...clients.

37:17.703 --> 37:18.970
Paint? Really?

37:19.104 --> 37:20.972
Are we gonna be talking
about paint?

37:21.106 --> 37:23.675
Can you ask me an--
a-another question?

37:26.144 --> 37:29.848
Yeah... Yeah, well, d-- uh,
different kind of d-doctor,

37:29.981 --> 37:32.751
different kind of hospital.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.020
Very inspiring.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.361
Yes.

37:43.562 --> 37:47.232
That one?
When did you see "that one"?

37:47.366 --> 37:51.537
****

37:51.670 --> 37:53.339
Really?
Um, you know what?

37:53.472 --> 37:55.441
We're gonna have to do this,
uh, another time.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.876
Thank you.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.465
We had a deal, didn't we?
Didn't we have a deal?

38:19.598 --> 38:21.433
What was supposed
to happen was,

38:21.567 --> 38:22.734
you were supposed to
take down the billboard.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.436
Did you forget?
Calm down.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.704
I'm not gonna calm down!

38:25.837 --> 38:27.873
You don't treat Shaun
like this.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.075
Shaun's the one who asked me
to keep the billboard up.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.977
I don't believe that.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.284

"Dear Salen, I have changed
my mind about the billboard.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.990
It can stay up."

38:49.227 --> 38:50.896
"As long as
you fix the image

38:51.029 --> 38:52.998
so my hair part is
on the correct side."

38:55.401 --> 38:57.936
Haven't had a chance
to do that yet.

38:58.069 --> 39:01.540

39:06.945 --> 39:11.483
He handled this on his own
without you.

39:11.617 --> 39:14.986
And he's better off
because of it.

39:15.120 --> 39:20.526

39:20.659 --> 39:22.260
Okay.

Hey.

(SIGHS)

39:44.950 --> 39:49.120
The truth is,
I'm not young.

39:49.254 --> 39:53.324
And I never would have
chosen to be a dad again.

39:53.459 --> 39:56.662
But I also didn't choose
to fall in love with you.

39:59.498 --> 40:05.203
So, now I'll do
what it takes to make
this relationship work,

40:05.336 --> 40:06.705
whatever you decide
to do.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.041
Prove it.

40:10.175 --> 40:14.345
I-I-I plan to with, uh,
caring, with...

40:14.480 --> 40:17.182
Prove it right now.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.965
Ow.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.367
And you wouldn't just be
a decent mom. You'd be
a great one, because...

40:36.502 --> 40:38.737
Not now, please.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.939
Sorry.

Maybe I was wrong.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.049
Maybe I don't need them
to fix my hair.

40:52.751 --> 40:56.588
Nah, it does look
a little off.
