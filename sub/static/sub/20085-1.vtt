01:25.209 --> 01:26.934
Don't play that, Applejack.

01:26.935 --> 01:29.924
# I was meant for.... #

01:30.590 --> 01:33.308
- I'm leaving.
- Julie!

01:34.695 --> 01:38.399
Would you go down to the station
and get me a ticket on the 11:00?

01:38.400 --> 01:40.393
And cash that check for me.

01:40.394 --> 01:41.538
Smith will do it for you.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.581
And I'd like you to drive me
to the train.

01:43.702 --> 01:45.506
Julie, you'd better think this over.

01:45.507 --> 01:47.500
I have been thinking it over,
Applejack.

01:47.528 --> 01:49.512
I've been thinking about it for days.

01:49.641 --> 01:51.942
You and Roger have been
married a long time.

01:52.471 --> 01:54.658
We don't need each other anymore.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.734
When that happens to two people...

01:57.233 --> 01:58.728
nothing left.

03:01.262 --> 03:07.838
# You were meant for me. #

03:07.839 --> 03:14.016
# I was meant for you. #

03:14.117 --> 03:17.006
# for you... for you... for... #

03:22.306 --> 03:29.154
# You were meant for me. #

03:29.155 --> 03:35.133
# I was meant for you. #

03:35.134 --> 03:45.596
# for you... for you... for you... #

03:46.459 --> 03:54.265
# You're like a plaintiff melody. #

03:54.266 --> 04:02.436
# That never lets me free. #

04:03.159 --> 04:10.244
# For I'm content the angels
must have sent you #

04:10.413 --> 04:17.101
# and they meant you just for me. #

04:17.547 --> 04:19.021
What can I do for you?

04:21.134 --> 04:23.118
- The record department.
- They're right here.

04:30.221 --> 04:32.046
How about that one up there,
that book?

04:32.174 --> 04:34.361
- Beethoven?
- Yes, the furthest one, see?

04:34.924 --> 04:36.477
Number seven.

04:42.138 --> 04:43.850
Oh, you keep them down here.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.029
- Needles?
- No, no.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.619
- Who plays the sheet music here?
- I do.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.530
-Oh, you do that?
-Hm-hmm.

04:55.928 --> 04:59.987
-Would you mind playing that for me?
-Certainly, I'd be glad to.

05:00.113 --> 05:05.011
# ...plaintiff melody. #

05:05.135 --> 05:11.563
# And I'm content the angels
must have sent you #

05:11.731 --> 05:18.997
# and they meant you just for me. #

05:19.085 --> 05:20.412
New tune, isn't it?

05:21.808 --> 05:23.502
I beg your pardon?

05:26.219 --> 05:27.613
It's a new tune.

05:28.172 --> 05:30.915
Oh, I didn't hear you.
Yes, it just came in.

05:34.589 --> 05:37.808
-Would be nice to dance to.
-It is.

05:39.132 --> 05:42.590
-What's on the other side?
- It's another new one.

05:45.575 --> 05:48.476
- Would you mind playing it for me?
- No.

05:48.477 --> 05:49.872
This way.

06:01.238 --> 06:07.847
# For I'm content the angels
must have sent you #

06:07.974 --> 06:17.292
# and they meant you just for me. #

06:29.496 --> 06:31.242
- Good night.
- Good night.

06:33.721 --> 06:35.625
Buy a flower, mister.

06:44.402 --> 06:45.467
I'm going this way, honest.

06:46.076 --> 06:48.105
I'm going this way, too, honest.

07:04.171 --> 07:06.075
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

07:06.204 --> 07:08.669
- I live here, that's all.
- Oh.

07:09.631 --> 07:12.895
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

07:14.391 --> 07:15.587
Oh...

07:19.914 --> 07:21.738
Would you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

07:21.947 --> 07:23.490
Guess not.

07:25.693 --> 07:27.963
- Have you got a victrola inside?

07:27.964 --> 07:30.156
Why, yes, of course.

07:30.556 --> 07:32.029
Would you let me hear this one?

07:32.548 --> 07:35.099
Otherwise I'll have to take it home
and imagine how it sounds.

07:35.737 --> 07:38.117
- Don't you have a machine at home?
- No.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.985
Well, why on earth did you buy 27...?

08:00.767 --> 08:04.504
# In my dreams it seems #

08:04.505 --> 08:08.989
# your face is near to me... #

08:08.990 --> 08:12.278
# and it's dear to me #

08:13.002 --> 08:25.393
# oh, it's just a memory. #

09:12.149 --> 09:13.497
What are you thinking about?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.524
That it's our song they're playing.

09:18.446 --> 09:20.905
At least that's what you said
when we were dancing.

09:22.392 --> 09:24.772
What are you thinking about?

09:24.903 --> 09:26.172
Oh, just wishing.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.278
Wishing I could be with you
every day like this.

09:30.782 --> 09:34.065
I mean, I wish everyday could be
a holiday like this.

09:34.747 --> 09:37.870
I mean, never have to go back home,
never have to go to work.

09:38.554 --> 09:40.265
It would be perfect, wouldn't it?

09:53.938 --> 09:56.919
- What's it say?
- Oh, nothing. It's silly.

09:57.047 --> 09:59.189
- Come on.
- No, really. It' s silly.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.208
Those things are a lot of bunk,
they never come true.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.832
Go on, beat it.

10:25.265 --> 10:27.645
You don't like kids very much,
do you?

10:27.647 --> 10:29.918
Oh, I like them, all right,
except when they're pests.

10:34.631 --> 10:36.772
- What does it say?
- Hm?

10:37.660 --> 10:39.292
- Come on.
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

10:39.414 --> 10:41.160
Come on, tell me.

10:45.943 --> 10:47.139
Come on.

10:53.782 --> 10:55.627
Unromantic.

11:00.179 --> 11:02.321
I thought you said we'd have
the place to ourselves.

11:02.451 --> 11:04.831
Oh, just the ocean.
The beach I couldn't get.

11:05.659 --> 11:07.268
Hey, you're doing all right.

11:07.269 --> 11:09.262
Two or three more lessons
and you'll be able to swim.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.854
You can almost float now.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.567
When your arms are holding me up.

11:13.810 --> 11:15.634
When you're with me, you're safe.

11:25.527 --> 11:27.590
I don't know whether it's safe or not.

11:28.317 --> 11:30.539
I'm darned if I do either.

11:34.296 --> 11:37.163
It must be getting late.
Let's get dressed.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.179
No, there's plenty of time.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.442
I'm thinking about that last train home.

11:43.926 --> 11:46.307
Come on, Roger.
Get dressed.

11:46.607 --> 11:47.763
All right.///

12:09.987 --> 12:11.987
..

12:13.397 --> 12:16.172
...

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
Joe Connor is here, yet?

12:27.707 --> 12:28.334
Yes.

12:29.532 --> 12:30.725
Joe!

12:33.767 --> 12:35.473
Hi, Joe!
Hello, Homer!

12:36.833 --> 12:38.381
Just off the boat!

12:38.993 --> 12:42.679
Julie, had Jack called ?
That's none of your bussiness!

12:42.952 --> 12:47.102
You don't have to bite my head off!
Oh, I'm sorry!

12:48.308 --> 12:51.250
It may have called, or someting!

12:51.596 --> 12:53.196
He said he may get out for a story.

12:57.116 --> 13:01.362
Julie, has he ever said anything?
You know what I mean..

13:04.372 --> 13:07.943
No, not right now.
That's what I thought.

13:08.366 --> 13:10.592
Men never say anything, 
you must drag it out of them

13:19.631 --> 13:21.631
Applejack!

13:21.879 --> 13:23.079
Let me take your things!

13:26.197 --> 13:29.179
Put them someplace where
I can grab them faster.

13:29.379 --> 13:31.073
I don't belong here.

13:31.099 --> 13:33.485
Of course you belong here.
Didn't I invite you?

13:33.770 --> 13:35.872
Come on in and meet
some of my friends.

13:35.873 --> 13:38.264
Night's cold...
Is there a drink in the house?

13:38.663 --> 13:41.138
Right off the boat.
That's what the bootlegger said.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.748
- Did he say what boat?
- Well, what boat would you like?

13:43.749 --> 13:45.638
We have all the labels.
Come on, help yourself.

13:48.197 --> 13:50.902
-You?
- Never use it.

14:02.028 --> 14:04.975
You know, this party
may turn out all right at that.

14:07.010 --> 14:10.711
- Where's Roger?
-I thought maybe you'd know.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.796
You're crazy about that reporter,
aren't you?

14:16.017 --> 14:17.968
I'm sort of fond of him.

14:18.568 --> 14:19.837
That's bad.

14:19.838 --> 14:23.501
I hate seeing a nice girl like you
getting mixed up with a newspaper man.

14:24.227 --> 14:26.120
Gosh, you never know
what they're up to.

14:26.121 --> 14:29.558
They can get away with anything,
alibiing their work.

14:32.170 --> 14:35.126
It's a lot of fun docking around
interviewing chorus girls

14:35.127 --> 14:36.921
and all that sort of thing.

14:38.536 --> 14:41.597
You think it's swell getting married...

14:41.625 --> 14:45.789
Applejack, don't worry about me.
I don't need any advice.

14:46.009 --> 14:48.395
I never even thought
about getting married.

14:49.377 --> 14:51.979
- No fooling?
- No fooling.

14:52.286 --> 14:55.527
- Well I've been worried sick.
- About what?

14:55.654 --> 14:58.034
I've been telling him for six months
if he doesn't keep away from you

14:58.065 --> 14:59.372
he'll find himself married.

15:23.852 --> 15:25.525
Julie, I've got to talk to you
right away.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.084
Hello!When dd you get here?
I wanna talk to you!

15:33.829 --> 15:36.400
It's something important to you
Where can we be alone?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.519
Why alone, I'm having fun.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.116
Don't be angry, Julie.
A lot has happened.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.316
That's not a reason to leave from a party, 
just before the midnight!

16:09.565 --> 16:11.565
I'm sorry, but I have a million things to do.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.389
I wanna tell you everything.

16:16.456 --> 16:18.456
I've had a real break.

16:19.156 --> 16:21.498
Flynn quit his job over in Tokyo.
He's our Japanese correspondent.

16:21.629 --> 16:24.180
He got fed up with the assignment,
or the weather, or something.

16:24.299 --> 16:25.988
Imagine the spot that left the paper in.

16:25.989 --> 16:27.882
Only one man in the Orient
and he walked out on the job.

16:28.843 --> 16:30.872
Darling, you're cold.
Here, put this around you.

16:30.995 --> 16:32.185
I'm just so excited.

16:34.378 --> 16:35.538
There you are.

16:35.539 --> 16:37.329
You're going to take his place?

16:37.532 --> 16:39.243
That's what they want me to do.

16:39.883 --> 16:42.468
I've got a ticket here for a train
that leaves at 3:00 a.m.

16:42.593 --> 16:45.699
Gets me to San Francisco just in time
to catch the next boat for Yokohama.

16:49.035 --> 16:52.096
I can't believe it yet, Julie.
Imagine them picking me.

16:52.742 --> 16:55.226
You're able, Roger.
You have ability.

16:55.227 --> 16:56.821
Anybody can see that.

16:58.402 --> 17:00.113
You're going, hm?

17:01.192 --> 17:03.220
That's what I want
to talk to you about, honey.

17:03.742 --> 17:06.089
It's a good salary.
Two-year contract.

17:06.114 --> 17:07.607
And I'm more or less my own boss.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.758
It's the kind of opportunity
I've always wanted.

17:10.518 --> 17:12.819
So look, dear, I was wondering...

17:12.949 --> 17:16.452
Listen, little boy.
Of course I want you to go.

17:16.576 --> 17:19.239
If that's what's worrying you,
please don't think...

17:19.366 --> 17:22.313
No, I wasn't worrying about that.

17:22.435 --> 17:24.940
I knew you'd want me
to take the job, sure.

17:24.941 --> 17:27.133
But, Julie...

17:27.396 --> 17:28.847
let's get married.

17:30.406 --> 17:32.675
Let's get married right away, tonight.

17:33.395 --> 17:36.341
I'll be able to send for you in three months.
I'll have the money then.

17:36.943 --> 17:40.685
Three months?
Why the rush to get married now?

17:42.104 --> 17:45.014
Well, do you think I'm going to let
a funny little redhead

17:45.015 --> 17:46.610
like you run around loose here?

17:46.727 --> 17:48.850
Suppose some other fellow
came along...

17:48.851 --> 17:51.242
Oh, Julie, I've got to have you.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.479
Until death do us part?

18:06.675 --> 18:08.659
Till death do us part.

18:15.284 --> 18:17.111
Happy New Year!

18:19.110 --> 18:20.742
Happy New Year!

18:24.132 --> 18:27.000
Happy New Year!

18:27.201 --> 18:30.069
I've got a cab waiting.
All we have to do is sign a license.

18:30.549 --> 18:31.977
Happy New Year!

18:53.486 --> 18:55.867
For richer or poorer...

18:56.077 --> 18:57.743
For richer or poorer.

18:57.910 --> 19:00.291
in sickness and in health,

19:00.421 --> 19:03.051
In sickness and in health,

19:03.171 --> 19:06.391
to love and to cherish,

19:06.519 --> 19:08.661
to love and to cherish,

19:08.791 --> 19:12.453
till death do us part.

19:12.936 --> 19:15.203
till death do us part.

19:20.549 --> 19:22.217
All aboard.
The ticket.

19:22.342 --> 19:23.690
We made it.

19:24.654 --> 19:27.635
- Well, good bye, Applejack.
- Good bye, boy.

19:27.842 --> 19:30.223
- Keep an eye on Julie for me.
- I sure will, boy.

19:30.911 --> 19:33.025
So long, Dot.
Take good care of her.

19:33.026 --> 19:34.413
I will.

19:35.112 --> 19:36.208
Good bye.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.797
Good bye, darling.

19:41.035 --> 19:42.429
Excuse me a minute.

19:42.828 --> 19:44.653
-Wait for me.
-All right.

19:45.698 --> 19:47.647
Oh, Roger, I can't say good bye.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.482
Here you are, sir.

19:52.553 --> 19:53.777
Thank you.

19:54.107 --> 19:57.213
It's not good bye, darling.
It's just see you later.

19:58.651 --> 20:00.702
-Is there anything I can do
for you, boss?

20:00.703 --> 20:03.782
-How soon does the train pull out?
- In about three minutes, sir.

20:03.783 --> 20:04.780
Thank you.

20:06.184 --> 20:08.054
Well, Mrs. Adams.

20:08.495 --> 20:11.283
Mrs. Adams!
Sounds strange.

20:12.202 --> 20:14.832
Not strange.
It sounds great.

20:15.391 --> 20:17.691
- Does sound great, doesn't it
- Yes, darling.

20:26.630 --> 20:28.657
There's something about a train.

20:28.658 --> 20:33.008
I don't know whether it's the way
it looks or the way it smells, or what it is.

20:33.009 --> 20:35.656
It always makes me feel
I want to be off somewhere.

20:35.996 --> 20:39.816
I know, darling. I always feel
the same way.

20:40.341 --> 20:43.684
Oh, Roger,
I wish this was our honeymoon.

20:43.808 --> 20:45.678
Oh, I do too, darling.

20:52.815 --> 20:54.764
Promise me something, will you?

20:56.442 --> 20:58.505
Promise me never to take it off.

20:58.794 --> 21:01.695
I'll never take it off,
no matter what happens.

21:01.696 --> 21:03.490
Thank you, darling.

21:14.936 --> 21:17.078
Roger, the train's moving.

21:17.207 --> 21:18.873
I'll get you off in a minute.

22:05.553 --> 22:07.502
All aboard!.

22:17.151 --> 22:18.262
Write from Yokohama.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.684
Roger.

23:08.174 --> 23:09.602
Darling.

23:11.795 --> 23:13.090
Oh, sweet.

23:28.381 --> 23:29.729
Here we are.

23:34.439 --> 23:36.582
- Ours?
- Yours.

23:36.950 --> 23:39.773
Roger, I didn't expect anything like this.

23:46.715 --> 23:49.140
It's like something in a dream.

23:50.182 --> 23:53.050
These are our servants,
Cook-San and O'Hanna-San.

23:53.172 --> 23:54.520
How do you do?

23:55.164 --> 23:56.434
-  Hello.
- Hello.

23:56.759 --> 23:58.743
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:59.150 --> 24:01.292
Hello, there.

24:02.936 --> 24:05.680
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:08.038 --> 24:11.099
- Whose children are they?
- The servant's children. They live here.

24:11.745 --> 24:13.619
I thought you didn't like children.

24:13.620 --> 24:17.235
Who, me? They're all right.
Come on in.

24:18.161 --> 24:19.589
How do you like the place?

24:19.716 --> 24:24.649
It's lovely. But it's so luxurious.
How could we afford it?

24:24.650 --> 24:27.042
Don't be so practical
when I'm being highly romantic.

24:27.070 --> 24:29.017
Nothing's too good for my little wife.

24:29.018 --> 24:30.613
Come on and see it.

24:31.355 --> 24:34.335
- How do you like that?
- It's beautiful.

24:35.379 --> 24:37.170
You are sweet.

24:37.292 --> 24:40.002
But I would have been satisfied
with anything just to be here.

24:40.122 --> 24:42.686
Oh, I know you would, darling.
But only the best for you.

24:42.694 --> 24:44.408
Come on, we have an upstairs
to this house too.

24:44.409 --> 24:46.501
- We have a shinshitsu.
- What's a shinshitsu?

24:46.502 --> 24:49.166
Shinshitsu is the Japanese word
for bedroom, believe it or not.

24:49.167 --> 24:51.675
That's right, you wrote me
you spoke Japanese.

24:52.836 --> 24:55.082
Roger, it's perfect.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.096
Simply perfect.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.650
I thought you'd like it.

25:01.305 --> 25:02.341
Hello, there.

25:03.996 --> 25:07.057
Roger, are we going to keep it,
I mean, stay here right along?

25:07.185 --> 25:08.737
Why, certainly.
It's yours.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.165
I bought the lease from
an American that went back.

25:11.808 --> 25:13.854
I got the lease, the furniture,
two servants, three kids...

25:13.855 --> 25:15.450
a cat, and her kid.

25:15.674 --> 25:17.226
All for 2,000 yen.

25:17.428 --> 25:20.454
Two thousand yen.
How much is that?

25:20.676 --> 25:22.561
About a thousand dollars.

25:22.968 --> 25:25.190
- A thousand dollars.
- That's right.

25:26.555 --> 25:28.081
How in the world did you do it?
I mean...

25:28.082 --> 25:30.772
get the money to send to me
and buy all this too?

25:30.899 --> 25:33.508
- I got an advance.
- Advance?

25:33.549 --> 25:37.272
Sure. An advance on the salary.
Everybody does out here.

25:38.352 --> 25:40.424
Only the other day a fellow
down at the office was saying...

25:40.425 --> 25:42.208
he wished April was here.

25:42.377 --> 25:43.467
And I said why?

25:43.468 --> 25:46.178
And he said, so I could get an advance
on my December salary.

25:52.541 --> 25:54.056
Oh, now, darling.

25:54.057 --> 25:57.716
You're not going to be one of those wives
always worried about money, are you?

25:57.742 --> 26:00.147
No, only...

26:00.373 --> 26:02.655
Besides, you forget we still
have the inheritance.

26:02.784 --> 26:08.316
Yes, I know, but I'd sort of
hate to start off in debt, especially...

26:08.317 --> 26:10.705
You've got a lot to learn
about the Orient.

26:13.409 --> 26:14.660
Roger...

26:18.212 --> 26:19.798
Remember this?

26:21.042 --> 26:23.285
Sure, it's one of those fortune things
you got at the beach.

26:23.413 --> 26:25.215
Fancy you keeping that.

26:26.243 --> 26:29.126
They're not always the bunk,
you said that.

26:29.252 --> 26:31.519
Did I say that?
Well, well.

26:31.643 --> 26:34.863
Sometimes, like wishes,
they come true.

26:34.991 --> 26:37.178
Sure they do, certainly.

26:55.437 --> 26:59.053
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you write me?

26:59.702 --> 27:01.210
You don't like them.

27:01.575 --> 27:04.398
I don't like them?
Why, of course I do.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.866
Why would I have three of them
running around the hou...?

27:07.872 --> 27:11.250
And this will be our own.
An American kid.

27:11.550 --> 27:13.144
Our own.

27:14.688 --> 27:16.400
Gee, that's great.

27:17.079 --> 27:21.612
Oh, Roger, I'm so relieved.

27:24.134 --> 27:26.356
You funny little redhead.

27:30.750 --> 27:36.163
Very fine kimono.
Very expensive.

27:36.270 --> 27:41.348
- Husband must be rich man.
- He's either rich or...

27:42.886 --> 27:45.891
- Moshi moshi!
- Hi!

28:03.332 --> 28:04.977
- What are you doing home
this time of the day?

28:04.978 --> 28:07.679
- What makes you so beautiful. huh?
- How did you get off so early?

28:07.680 --> 28:09.373
Come on, let me see you.

28:10.347 --> 28:12.811
Well, if having babies
makes you look like this

28:12.812 --> 28:14.506
we'd better keep on having them.

28:14.532 --> 28:17.355
- How do you like it?
- Oh, Roger, I adore it.

28:17.561 --> 28:19.828
Why all this today?
This isn't my birthday.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.910
It's a souvenir.
A souvenir of your stay in Japan...

28:21.911 --> 28:23.289
because, darling, we're leaving.

28:23.739 --> 28:25.246
Leaving Japan?
Hm-hmm.

28:25.373 --> 28:27.207
Now brace yourself for good news,
Mrs. Adams,

28:27.208 --> 28:29.301
because good news is what I bring.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.691
We now belong to that class of society

28:33.692 --> 28:35.484
known as the filthy rich.

28:36.061 --> 28:38.274
- Roger, the inheritance.
- Yes.

28:38.275 --> 28:39.926
- You got it!
- Yes, mam.

28:42.996 --> 28:44.851
- That's wonderful.
- There, now, you see?

28:44.852 --> 28:46.346
You didn't believe me about it,
did you?

28:46.504 --> 28:48.646
- No, no, I didn't...
- Isn't it great?

28:50.569 --> 28:52.711
Thank you for the dolly.

28:52.841 --> 28:55.811
-  Thank you for the ball.
- Oh, that's all right.

28:56.627 --> 28:58.736
I'm teaching him to be a first baseman.

29:02.048 --> 29:05.425
Now, paragraph two,
Mr. and Mrs. Roger Adams,

29:05.426 --> 29:08.383
socially prominent young couple
plan to take a trip around the world.

29:08.743 --> 29:11.769
-The paper's sending you?
- No, I quit the paper.

29:11.892 --> 29:13.556
We're going to have a last fling
before we settle down

29:13.557 --> 29:15.439
and become good old American parents

29:15.479 --> 29:17.433
But, Roger, you just didn't give up
your job on the paper

29:17.434 --> 29:21.021
- ...for no reason at all?
- Oh, darling, this trip's an inspiration.

29:21.338 --> 29:23.070
Do you remember the honeymoon
I promised you?

29:23.092 --> 29:24.281
Well we're gonna have it.

29:24.487 --> 29:27.274
But everything's different now.
We've got to think about the baby.

29:27.396 --> 29:30.219
That's just it. As soon as the baby comes
we won't be able to go anywhere.

29:30.345 --> 29:32.726
Besides, I want our baby born
in the USA.

29:32.976 --> 29:35.481
Maybe even get to work
and start a little paper.

29:36.045 --> 29:38.504
But a trip like this costs a fortune.

29:39.353 --> 29:40.985
Did you get more than the $20.000?

29:42.900 --> 29:45.008
No, as a matter of fact
we didn't get the $20.000.

29:45.212 --> 29:47.796
We sold the property for cash
and got $13.500.

29:48.719 --> 29:51.983
Well, can you take a trip, buy a paper
and all like that on $13.500?

29:52.147 --> 29:55.208
Don't forget there's still lawyers' fees,
deductions and stuff like that.

29:55.813 --> 29:57.797
Just how much did you get, Roger?

29:58.524 --> 30:02.219
I'm trying to tell you.
After the deductions we got $10,000.

30:02.669 --> 30:03.892
- Ten thousand?
- Hm-hmm.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.564
I still got a couple of thousand
in bills around here to pay.

30:08.368 --> 30:11.192
Then you really got only $8,000.

30:11.357 --> 30:12.871
Yes.

30:14.586 --> 30:17.093
Well, did you ever have
that much money in your life?

30:17.217 --> 30:18.580
No.

30:18.612 --> 30:20.662
Then what are you squawking about?

30:21.042 --> 30:22.794
I'm not squawking.

30:23.196 --> 30:26.341
I just think you're acting like a child.

30:26.662 --> 30:28.566
We should be thinking about the future.

30:29.183 --> 30:33.188
You rush in and pack your things
and give up a perfectly good job.

30:33.358 --> 30:35.899
- No grown-up man shouldn't act like that.
- Oh, all right.

30:36.228 --> 30:38.733
I thought the trip would be
a lot of fun for you.

30:38.758 --> 30:40.980
If I had known you would feel
like that, I wouldn't have planned on it.

30:42.565 --> 30:45.106
That's all right, let's forget it.
We won't go.

30:48.025 --> 30:49.895
I'll go in and arrange for the packing.

30:50.177 --> 30:51.809
Oh, no, forget about it.

32:29.738 --> 32:31.166
Well, that's all.

32:36.792 --> 32:38.979
Otherwise, you'll enjoy perfect health.

32:39.702 --> 32:42.207
You'll be playing tennis
in a couple of months.

32:43.050 --> 32:45.078
Now I've got some good news for you.

32:45.800 --> 32:49.044
I'm letting your husband
see you today. How's that?

32:49.168 --> 32:50.333
Pretty.

32:50.463 --> 32:52.015
Make you feel better?

32:52.575 --> 32:54.819
I've had my hands full
keeping that boy out of here

32:54.820 --> 32:56.813
for the last couple of days.

33:15.891 --> 33:18.396
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Roger.

33:20.435 --> 33:22.147
How sweet.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.497
Gee, I've been miserable
not being able to see you, honey.

33:59.534 --> 34:02.798
But I've had a chance
to do some serious thinking, dear.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.782
I've been scouting around
the nearby towns

34:05.783 --> 34:08.572
trying to look for that
little newspaper, you know.

34:14.704 --> 34:17.693
No more silly ideas
like travelling around, darling.

34:17.694 --> 34:19.686
You were absolutely right about that.

34:23.991 --> 34:25.781
I think I found it, honey.

34:30.009 --> 34:33.228
It's in a little town just north of here,
a place called Rosalia.

34:33.955 --> 34:36.222
- Did you ever hear of it?
- Hm-hmm.

34:46.947 --> 34:49.373
It's pretty nearly
the kind of place we wanted.

34:51.870 --> 34:54.692
The fellow who owns the place
has been kind of letting it go to seed, but

34:54.693 --> 34:56.387
we can make something of it.

35:01.177 --> 35:03.589
Best of all, darling,
we'll have a home of our own.

35:03.590 --> 35:05.981
Something we'll always call ours.

35:06.756 --> 35:09.579
If I can make a go of the paper,
I'll be able to get you anything you want.

35:10.304 --> 35:15.359
I'll be able to get you furniture,
a car, clothes, everything.

35:17.757 --> 35:20.039
You know, it's strange, Roger...

35:21.036 --> 35:24.324
but I can't get myself to care
about those things now.

35:26.218 --> 35:28.610
They don't seem important anymore.

35:30.750 --> 35:34.808
The one thing I've really wanted...

35:36.489 --> 35:38.473
I'm never going to have.

37:50.804 --> 37:53.910
- What do you think of this one, Skeeter?
- Quite an improvement.

37:54.073 --> 37:56.335
Gee, Mr. Adams, I'd like to get a job

37:56.336 --> 37:58.827
in a live wire outfit like this.

37:58.828 --> 38:02.045
You would? All right, Skeetey,
you've got one, and a permanent job, too.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.441
Oh, boy.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.113
- Applejack.
- Howdy!

38:30.114 --> 38:32.406
- Hello, fellow!
- How's the old married man?

38:32.534 --> 38:34.637
You had me worried.
Thought you were gonna let me down.

38:34.766 --> 38:36.720
So this is the fastest growing
little newspaper

38:36.721 --> 38:38.514
in the fastest growing little town
in the west.

38:38.711 --> 38:41.437
- Certainly!
- And you left the Bulletin for this.

38:42.259 --> 38:44.079
What you got here?

38:44.279 --> 38:46.391
Our new makeup.
What do you think of it?

38:50.973 --> 38:54.552
You printed in code?
No, the linotype machine is stuck.

38:54.561 --> 38:56.150
Why did you think I sent for you?

38:56.234 --> 38:57.548
Applejack!

38:58.027 --> 38:59.217
Miss Julie!

38:59.661 --> 39:01.848
Am I glad to see you.

39:02.670 --> 39:05.558
Come on up and help me
fix the bathtub. You're just in time.

39:05.679 --> 39:07.703
Wait a minute.
Let him fix this first.

39:07.991 --> 39:11.255
All right. The newspaper always
comes first around here.

39:12.335 --> 39:13.480
Come on.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.942
What've you been feeding it?

39:19.470 --> 39:21.181
- Is the switch on?
- Yeah.

39:25.448 --> 39:27.397
Now where's that bathtub?

40:16.504 --> 40:18.011
Hello, Applejack.

40:18.138 --> 40:19.770
I didn't know you were busy.

40:19.812 --> 40:21.402
I'm not busy.

40:25.403 --> 40:28.293
I've just been thinking about
fixing up this old storeroom.

40:28.515 --> 40:31.813
I just wanted to show you a new ad
we got from the telephone company.

40:32.979 --> 40:35.121
- Well, that helps, doesn't it?
- Sure does.

40:35.191 --> 40:38.030
If we keep on with it
we'll pay the paper bill next month.

40:38.977 --> 40:40.425
Is Roger back yet?

40:40.671 --> 40:43.283
No, he's still out
running down subscriptions.

40:43.284 --> 40:45.574
Said he might not be home till late.

40:46.370 --> 40:49.737
Well, come on then. Sit down, Applejack.
We might as well have our dinner.

41:02.393 --> 41:05.013
Miss Julie, we ought to have
a kid around this house.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.659
I thought you knew about that,
Applejack.

41:09.078 --> 41:12.865
Sure I know about that.
But I'm talking about adopting one.

41:16.690 --> 41:19.354
Sure you can get
some pretty ones that way.

41:20.357 --> 41:22.782
You know, I'm an adopted kid myself.

41:23.545 --> 41:26.767
I know that's not much
of a recommendation, but...

41:26.768 --> 41:28.761
it didn't turn out so bad.

41:29.006 --> 41:32.191
Besides, I know a lot of regular kids
who wound up in jail.

41:35.303 --> 41:37.073
Miss Julie, I wish you could have seen

41:37.074 --> 41:39.774
some of those little sons of guns
I used to room with.

41:40.365 --> 41:44.060
They was the cutest little rascals
you'd ever want to look at.

41:45.347 --> 41:48.248
I don't think Roger would want
a child that way, Applejack.

41:49.093 --> 41:50.759
One that wasn't his own.

41:51.166 --> 41:52.231
Why not?

41:52.361 --> 41:55.309
He's no sucker.
He don't want to gamble.

41:55.869 --> 41:58.736
How do you know what it's gonna be like
if it's gotta be your own?

41:59.057 --> 42:03.082
This way you just walk in
and help yourself to exactly what you want.

42:03.362 --> 42:05.390
There's no guess work.

42:08.423 --> 42:10.611
You know, I thought a lot about that.

42:12.927 --> 42:14.480
I want one.

42:17.790 --> 42:20.249
Roger was so disappointed when...

42:20.898 --> 42:22.451
I just haven't had the courage to...

42:22.572 --> 42:25.077
Miss Julie, do you want
to know something?

42:25.602 --> 42:27.745
He's all for the idea.

42:28.710 --> 42:34.283
Only a few days ago we were working
together and I was talking with him...

42:34.728 --> 42:37.596
- You were talking to him about this?
- Sure.

42:37.837 --> 42:39.664
He's all for it.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.447
Why didn't he say something to me?

42:44.613 --> 42:46.585
He was afraid to say
anything to you...

42:46.586 --> 42:49.376
he was afraid you might have
some fool notions.

42:51.508 --> 42:53.220
Silly notions?

42:55.374 --> 42:57.661
Why, if he only knew how many...

43:00.396 --> 43:02.469
Why, the very idea.

43:02.470 --> 43:07.353
My own husband talking about
things like this with the printer.

43:08.088 --> 43:11.438
- Press Manager, please.
- All right, the press manager.

43:11.715 --> 43:15.934
- Are you going to be the mother?
- No, I just thought I...

43:16.019 --> 43:20.435
Fine thing. Wait till I get
my hands on that fellow.

43:21.559 --> 43:23.192
Hello, what's going on?
A fight?

43:24.469 --> 43:25.783
- Hello, Roger.

43:25.904 --> 43:28.204
I want you to take a look at that new ad.
Would you come downstairs...

43:28.335 --> 43:30.803
No, Roger.
Wait a minute. Applejack.

43:31.045 --> 43:33.754
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Hm? Tell you what?

43:33.875 --> 43:36.176
What you and Applejack
have been talking about.

43:36.306 --> 43:38.369
Miss Julie, I told you in confidence.

43:39.654 --> 43:42.239
What were you talking about?
What did you say to her?

43:42.324 --> 43:45.112
- You know, about the...
- He told me.

43:46.270 --> 43:49.296
- Told you what?
- You know, what we were talking about...

43:49.738 --> 43:51.324
What were we talking about?

43:51.970 --> 43:55.586
Roger, if you wanted to adopt a baby,
why didn't you talk to me?

43:55.716 --> 43:58.935
Yes, you should've told her
in the first place, Roger, not me.

43:59.064 --> 44:00.333
I'm not gonna be the mother.

44:01.734 --> 44:05.430
Wait a minute. Did you tell Julie
I wanted to adopt a baby?

44:05.999 --> 44:10.499
I hinted at it.
I tried to break it to her gently.

44:10.622 --> 44:12.731
- Oh, you told her!
- Yeah.

44:14.093 --> 44:16.315
Roger, I'm so glad
you feel that way.

44:16.883 --> 44:19.342
Yes, she wants it
even more than you, Roger.

44:19.753 --> 44:21.543
Well, if that's the way
we all feel about it.

44:21.666 --> 44:22.980
I like it too

44:23.181 --> 44:26.955
- I suppose it's settled.
- Oh, Roger, I'm so glad.

44:27.405 --> 44:29.214
If it hadn't been for Applejack
letting it slip out

44:29.215 --> 44:31.008
I don't suppose
I ever would have known.

44:31.112 --> 44:33.420
Guess I'd better go fix that press.

44:33.862 --> 44:35.925
Yeah, you fix everything up,
don't you?

44:36.054 --> 44:38.276
Didn't do so bad with the bathtub.

44:40.705 --> 44:44.282
Julie, one other thing...
Look, er...

44:45.368 --> 44:48.349
When you get to this place,
don't get enthusiastic right off the bat.

44:48.875 --> 44:52.900
You know, don't just rush in and grab
the first kid you see and go nuts about it.

44:54.216 --> 44:57.163
What makes you think I'll grab
the first one they show me?

44:57.364 --> 45:00.312
I've been doing the shopping
in this family for some time now...

45:00.593 --> 45:02.735
I just don't bring home anything.

45:03.622 --> 45:05.730
You came home with this tie,
didn't you?

45:05.894 --> 45:09.079
It's nice.
Everybody's wearing bow ties.

45:10.915 --> 45:12.468
I have your letter here.

45:13.626 --> 45:15.654
Two-year-old child, blue eyes...

45:15.858 --> 45:18.283
curly hair, dimpled chin,
sweet disposition...

45:18.847 --> 45:20.195
We'd prefer a boy.

45:20.361 --> 45:22.310
But we'd like to look at the girl, too.

45:22.434 --> 45:24.383
Julie, you know we agreed on a boy.

45:24.506 --> 45:26.218
But it won't hurt to look, will it?

45:26.340 --> 45:28.244
All right, we'll look.

45:28.532 --> 45:30.561
Now, what can you show us?

45:31.123 --> 45:34.745
This is the Administration Building.
We don't have any children here at all.

45:34.746 --> 45:35.925
Oh.

45:37.221 --> 45:41.224
Everybody wants blue eyes,
curly hair, dimple... sweet...

45:41.225 --> 45:44.414
Everybody wants a two-year-old child.
Will you tell me why?

45:46.228 --> 45:49.278
Well, you see, in our case,

45:49.279 --> 45:52.069
that would have been the age
of our own child, if...

45:52.070 --> 45:55.458
Oh, I see.

45:56.511 --> 45:58.616
Anyway, when they're two years old,

45:58.617 --> 46:00.610
they're more or less
house-broken then, aren't they?

46:01.812 --> 46:03.285
Not always.

46:09.384 --> 46:12.366
At the moment we haven't
any children available at all.

46:12.493 --> 46:14.271
There's a long waiting list,

46:14.272 --> 46:16.564
there are three applications for every child.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.984
If you get one within a year,
you'll be lucky.

46:18.985 --> 46:20.479
- What?
- A year?

46:20.480 --> 46:23.168
You mean to say
we might have to wait a year?

46:23.414 --> 46:26.495
Well, after all, real parents
wait almost a year.

46:26.602 --> 46:31.182
- Yes, certainly...
- You see, we've waited so long already.

46:31.305 --> 46:33.890
I know, my dear.
But you're both very young.

46:34.374 --> 46:37.400
Then, too, we have to have time
to make our investigation.

46:38.161 --> 46:39.475
Investigation?

46:39.595 --> 46:42.896
Yes, you see. we're just as particular
about you as prospective parents

46:42.897 --> 46:45.189
as you are about the child.

46:45.853 --> 46:47.405
Naturally.

46:47.686 --> 46:49.953
What is your business, Mr. Adams?

46:50.954 --> 46:53.697
I'm a publisher.
I run the Rosalia Courier.

46:53.824 --> 46:55.536
- Publisher?
- Sure.

46:56.694 --> 47:00.513
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Green is on the phone.

47:00.514 --> 47:02.108
What shall I tell her?

47:03.230 --> 47:04.500
Oh..

47:04.501 --> 47:06.494
Tell her that we're sorry.

47:06.495 --> 47:08.986
But according to our investigator's report

47:08.987 --> 47:12.048
we find that Mr. Green
doesn't have a steady income.

47:12.058 --> 47:15.421
Later perhaps, if he finds himself
better situated, we'll...

47:15.546 --> 47:17.529
reconsider their application.

47:19.252 --> 47:23.049
You see, it's not our aim to place
our children in homes of wealth...

47:23.078 --> 47:26.136
but it's absolutely necessary for us
to have the assurance

47:26.137 --> 47:29.317
that the adoptive parents
are financially responsible.

47:29.318 --> 47:30.314
Oh, sure.

47:31.329 --> 47:34.109
I see in your letter
that you live in the country.

47:34.199 --> 47:38.096
Good. I presume that means then
that you have a house and yard.

47:39.260 --> 47:42.365
- Well...
- No, we don't have a yard.

47:42.468 --> 47:46.902
We live in an apartment.
But there's a nice park nearby.

47:47.152 --> 47:50.514
We've got a swell roof too.
We've been putting a fence around it.

47:50.515 --> 47:53.136
And I could build a slide and a sandbox.

47:53.528 --> 47:55.879
As a matter of fact,
a roof is better for a kid

47:55.880 --> 47:57.773
because then he can't get on the street, see?

47:58.829 --> 48:00.972
Look, it doesn't have
to be a yard, does it?

48:01.101 --> 48:04.637
No, but you have a separate room
for the child, haven't you?

48:04.848 --> 48:06.037
That's very important.

48:06.163 --> 48:10.187
Oh, yes, we have a lovely room.
It's practically fixed up now.

48:10.348 --> 48:12.093
Oh, well that's fine.

48:12.859 --> 48:15.488
Now, about income.

48:16.605 --> 48:19.507
Approximately, how much
do you make a week?

48:21.786 --> 48:24.734
Well, I couldn't tell you offhand.

48:24.855 --> 48:27.961
I imagine about $100 a week.
Of course, I'd have to look at the books.

48:28.084 --> 48:29.512
Well, that's excellent.

48:29.678 --> 48:31.961
If you'll just take that application
home with you,

48:31.962 --> 48:35.549
fill it out and mail it in to us
so we'll have all the details.

48:35.577 --> 48:38.362
Then in due time, one of our investigators
will call on you.

48:38.363 --> 48:39.359
Fine.

48:39.602 --> 48:42.545
You'll call us before she comes,
won't you?

48:42.711 --> 48:46.451
No, we just drop in.
That's our policy.

48:46.697 --> 48:50.358
You see, we want to find your house
as it is everyday...

48:50.483 --> 48:53.748
- ...not when it's fixed up for company.
- I see.

48:53.749 --> 48:56.301
- Good bye.
- Good bye, Miss Oliver.

48:58.235 --> 49:02.436
Oh... it doesn't matter
if he hasn't got curly hair.

49:02.437 --> 49:04.330
It doesn't really matter.

49:10.730 --> 49:15.789
- They're darn choosy, if you ask me.
- Why do you have to be a big shot?

49:16.066 --> 49:18.242
- When?
- You know we don't make $100 a week.

49:19.442 --> 49:20.372
You want the baby, don't you?

49:20.618 --> 49:22.760
They can't prove it.
We don't keep books.

49:29.147 --> 49:30.699
Hey, quit stalling.
Get on with the cleaning.

49:30.821 --> 49:32.249
Look, honey, left from the earthquake.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.722
From Japan?
You'd better buy some more.

49:55.990 --> 49:58.937
Excuse me, lady.
You should give a fellow a warning.

50:00.135 --> 50:01.563
Does Mrs. Adams live here?

50:01.689 --> 50:03.638
Yes, upstairs. I'll call her.

50:03.762 --> 50:07.503
Don't bother. I'm Miss Oliver
from the orphanage. I'll find her.

50:07.628 --> 50:11.290
I don't think she's home just now.
I think she's in church.

50:11.414 --> 50:13.477
In church?
This time of day?

50:13.706 --> 50:18.538
Well, you see, she and Mr. Adams
go there quite a lot.

50:18.668 --> 50:22.488
They just go there and sit.
Fine people, mam.

50:32.020 --> 50:34.967
Well, I'm sure she won't mind
if I just look around a bit.

50:37.368 --> 50:40.904
No, she won't mind.

51:29.261 --> 51:31.527
-How do you do, Miss Oliver?
- How do you do, Mrs. Adams?

51:33.007 --> 51:35.149
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

51:37.033 --> 51:38.903
Won't you sit down?

51:43.051 --> 51:44.683
- Here.
- No, thank you.

51:48.631 --> 51:51.816
- You've come to see the apartment?
- That's right.

51:53.932 --> 51:58.669
This is it. It's not very neat
at the moment. We're cleaning.

51:59.312 --> 52:00.457
I see.

52:03.776 --> 52:05.760
That's our little breakfast room out there.

52:08.949 --> 52:10.512
And uh...

52:11.309 --> 52:13.814
if you'll step right this way...

52:18.523 --> 52:19.996
This is our kitchen.

52:25.856 --> 52:29.079
My husband has been meaning
to fix this door for some time, it's...

52:30.076 --> 52:31.441
he's been so busy...

52:35.581 --> 52:41.997
And that brings us back
to the breakfast room.

52:47.976 --> 52:50.958
- Can I fix you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

52:52.121 --> 52:55.579
You spoke of a child's room.
A lovely room.

52:56.147 --> 52:58.572
Yes, that's over here.

53:15.955 --> 53:20.059
- Well, this is sweet.
- You really like it?

53:20.180 --> 53:23.478
Any child would be lucky
to have a room like this.

53:24.086 --> 53:27.622
Well, I want you to see our yard.
We're fixing that up too.

53:31.858 --> 53:32.923
Well...

53:33.891 --> 53:36.917
Hello, Miss Oliver.
Didn't expect you.

53:37.597 --> 53:39.071
I just finished making it.

53:39.311 --> 53:42.213
I thought I'd try it out see if it was
strong enough for that two-year old.

53:42.500 --> 53:44.925
I think I have a surprise for you.

53:45.887 --> 53:47.792
A baby came in yesterday.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.506
- No!
- Miss Oliver, you mean...

53:49.634 --> 53:51.300
- Here, come and sit down.
- Thank you.

53:53.659 --> 53:54.725
Sit down.

53:55.851 --> 53:59.467
That's the reason we came around
to see you sooner than we expected.

53:59.598 --> 54:00.992
It's a little girl..

54:02.627 --> 54:04.135
We don't want a girl.

54:05.935 --> 54:08.315
Five weeks and three days old.

54:08.924 --> 54:10.318
Five weeks!

54:13.269 --> 54:15.932
Well, we did speak
of an older child, you know.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.967
You might have to wait a long time.

54:19.048 --> 54:23.547
After all, aren't you making to great
a point of a child's age, Mr. Adams?

54:23.830 --> 54:26.812
Eventually this child
will be two years old.

54:28.135 --> 54:30.515
But we don't know anything
about little babies.

54:31.084 --> 54:33.465
No one does until they have them.

54:33.675 --> 54:36.498
And this is such an unusual little baby.

54:37.023 --> 54:40.266
Actually there's another couple
who has first choice...

54:40.267 --> 54:41.861
and that's strictly off the record.

54:41.885 --> 54:45.229
But somehow I feel she's exactly
the child for you.

54:45.472 --> 54:47.456
That's why I wanted you to see her first

54:47.585 --> 54:49.534
and I couldn't resist giving you the chance.

54:49.535 --> 54:52.456
- Did you bring her with you
- No, she's in the nursery.

54:52.527 --> 54:54.828
You and Mr. Adams will have to come
over to the city to see her.

54:56.393 --> 54:58.105
What's she like, Miss Oliver?

54:58.904 --> 55:03.880
Well, I can't describe her exactly,
but she's...

55:04.842 --> 55:07.903
well, she's like no other child.

55:09.705 --> 55:12.290
Like no other child.

55:12.814 --> 55:14.559
But she isn't a boy.

55:17.517 --> 55:20.101
But look, Roger,
there's no harm in looking at her.

55:20.307 --> 55:22.290
If you don't like her,
I won't say a word.

55:22.419 --> 55:23.893
What's the use? We don't want her.

55:28.318 --> 55:31.934
Please, darling.
It won't hurt to look at her.

55:35.492 --> 55:37.362
Well, all right, we'll look.

55:37.564 --> 55:41.563
That's fine. You call me up and I'll make
an appointment at the nursery.

55:41.564 --> 55:43.158
I must go now.

55:46.651 --> 55:50.188
If you change your mind,
you will call me up, won't you?

55:51.673 --> 55:53.395
Yes, yes.

55:54.623 --> 55:58.885
Miss Oliver, please don't show her to that
other couple until we've seen her, will you?

55:59.166 --> 56:01.037
I won't, my dear.

56:49.644 --> 56:51.991
She's like no other child.

56:52.358 --> 56:54.679
That's why I wanted you
to see her first.

56:55.078 --> 56:57.669
Like no other child.

57:09.034 --> 57:10.279
Well, how about him?

57:12.641 --> 57:16.424
This is a day nursery.
All these youngsters have parents.

57:16.826 --> 57:19.734
All except this lovely little girl.

57:31.912 --> 57:33.797
What a grip...

57:35.340 --> 57:37.072
For a girl, I mean.

57:38.209 --> 57:40.220
Would you like to hold her?

57:40.660 --> 57:42.326
May I.

58:15.773 --> 58:17.525
How are you, kid?

58:24.502 --> 58:27.880
Well, you've had your look, dear.
How about going back home?

58:33.888 --> 58:36.774
All right, she's yours, I guess.

58:40.531 --> 58:43.036
- When do we get her?
- Now, if you like.

58:43.361 --> 58:45.912
She's yours on a year's probation.

58:46.031 --> 58:47.017
Now?

58:47.586 --> 58:50.170
You mean we can just walk out
of here with her like this?

58:50.256 --> 58:52.405
It sometimes happens that way...

58:52.627 --> 58:58.064
if we make sure that the parents
and the baby are just right for each other.

58:58.945 --> 59:01.529
We have no clothes for her.
We don't know how to feed her.

59:01.655 --> 59:03.445
It's such a little baby.

59:03.479 --> 59:05.879
Miss Morgan will take care of everything.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.630
She'll give you the formulas and so forth...

59:07.653 --> 59:10.577
then you can go downtown
and buy whatever is necessary.

59:18.673 --> 59:20.622
Thank you, Miss Oliver,
for being so kind.

59:20.627 --> 59:23.489
Don't thank me.
It just happened so.

59:23.616 --> 59:26.961
Perhaps before you make up
your minds fully to take the child...

59:26.983 --> 59:29.269
you'd like to have me go
into her history.

59:29.554 --> 59:32.059
I assure you it's an excellent one.

59:33.480 --> 59:36.238
If she'll take a chance on us,
we'll take a chance on her.

59:36.239 --> 59:39.313
- Good bye.
- Good bye, Miss. Oliver.

59:53.745 --> 59:55.297
I'll shut the door.

01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:10.085
I she wakes up again,
you know what that means.

01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:16.683
Wait a minute. Wait with that baby
till I turn on the light.

01:00:16.684 --> 01:00:19.075
I don't want you to drop him...
I mean her.

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:44.344
Take off your shoes.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:33.288
Go get the big one in our room.

01:02:49.989 --> 01:02:53.174
Come on... let me have it

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:03.330
It's all right with her.
Come on, let's go to bed.

01:03:04.855 --> 01:03:06.000
No.

01:03:21.116 --> 01:03:22.907
I don't think I'll go to bed.

01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:24.973
She eats again in a half hour.

01:03:25.779 --> 01:03:27.604
The directions say so.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.995
Set the alarm.
Come on.

01:03:35.903 --> 01:03:37.773
Turn the bed clothes down, will you?

01:03:47.302 --> 01:03:48.888
Turn it off!

01:03:51.646 --> 01:03:53.154
Turn it off!

01:03:53.798 --> 01:03:55.113
Press it!

01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:08.700
Please.

01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:45.923
What's the matter with it?

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.616
I don't know.
Do you think she's all right?

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:48.613
Huh?

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.840
Is it breathing?

01:05:07.014 --> 01:05:08.967
She's certainly a cute a little baby,
isn't she?

01:05:09.963 --> 01:05:11.688
We were lucky to get her.

01:05:17.098 --> 01:05:18.207
Let's go to bed.

01:06:13.275 --> 01:06:14.703
Well, do something, quickly!

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:23.058
What do I do?

01:06:23.184 --> 01:06:26.642
Do something. Can't you see
the baby's suffering?

01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:29.319
That's just it.
I don't know what to do.

01:06:34.225 --> 01:06:36.854
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:39.514
Here. You take her.
Hm?

01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:43.031
Go on. You do something.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.271
Oh, no... I'm going to get Miss Oliver.

01:07:24.025 --> 01:07:25.698
Just wanted her daddy.

01:07:27.552 --> 01:07:29.264
Pull the chair, please.

01:10:08.611 --> 01:10:11.434
Julie! The baby!
It's gone!

01:10:12.437 --> 01:10:14.869
The baby's kidnapped!

01:10:34.206 --> 01:10:36.665
She was lonesome
so I brought her in here with us.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:41.055
Don't ever do that to me again!

01:10:52.002 --> 01:10:53.411
Good morning, boys.

01:11:08.302 --> 01:11:10.411
What are you trying to do?
Shut it off!

01:11:20.984 --> 01:11:23.396
- What are you trying to do?
- What am I trying to do?

01:11:23.397 --> 01:11:26.159
I'm trying to get your crummy paper out,
that's what I'm trying to do.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.877
What's the idea of waking
the baby up?

01:11:28.038 --> 01:11:29.784
- What baby?
- My baby.

01:11:29.912 --> 01:11:33.369
- Your baby?
- Yeah, it came last night.

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:34.972
No fooling, a baby?

01:11:36.089 --> 01:11:38.370
- A baby, a baby!
- Quiet, quiet!

01:11:39.238 --> 01:11:40.666
Come on, I'll show you.

01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:23.019
- Can I help?
- No.

01:12:51.318 --> 01:12:54.100
- Sure you don't want me to help?
- No, thanks.

01:14:20.795 --> 01:14:23.663
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

01:14:37.913 --> 01:14:39.341
What's the trouble?

01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:42.609
I can't do anything as long as
you're sitting here watching me.

01:14:42.736 --> 01:14:45.097
Get out! Go on,
get out all of you!

01:14:45.227 --> 01:14:46.793
What do you think this is?

01:14:46.961 --> 01:14:50.324
Go on, get down to that paper.
And be quiet about it.

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.403
Oh, Roger, I'm afraid I'll drown it.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.906
Oh, now, darling, take it easy.

01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:01.703
I could drown in that much water.
Here.

01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:19.441
Now, little peanut...

01:15:23.588 --> 01:15:26.694
your Uncle Applejack's gonna
give you a nice bath.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.890
Give me that wash rag.
There we are.///

01:15:47.274 --> 01:15:49.947
I'll never be able to do that.
We'll have to give her back.

01:15:49.948 --> 01:15:51.742
Sure you will, darling.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.697
All you gotta do is decide
who's boss and throw her in.

01:15:56.564 --> 01:15:59.129
How in the world did you ever
learn to do that, Applejack?

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:00.904
My sister had four kids.

01:16:01.028 --> 01:16:03.011
She'd take two and I'd take two.

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:17.920
Where's that towel?

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.325
There we are.

01:16:34.268 --> 01:16:37.428
- Where's the talcum?
- Hm? Here.

01:16:55.165 --> 01:16:56.560
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

01:16:58.056 --> 01:16:59.451
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

01:17:00.254 --> 01:17:02.203
- Where is it?
- What?

01:17:02.366 --> 01:17:04.537
- It.
- Oh, here...

01:17:07.049 --> 01:17:08.635
- There we are.

01:17:08.962 --> 01:17:11.369
You sure is my fine girl.

01:17:20.421 --> 01:17:22.007
Just a minute, now..

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.853
Think you can hold this a minute
without dropping it?

01:17:38.037 --> 01:17:39.908
Here, give it here.

01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:41.736
I forget whether...

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.087
Now watch this closely.

01:17:54.817 --> 01:17:57.039
I'm a one-pin man myself.

01:18:00.915 --> 01:18:04.054
There we are.
Let's see you jump out of there, peanut.

01:18:09.364 --> 01:18:11.155
Here you go to your mama.

01:18:15.622 --> 01:18:19.079
Better write all that down,
cause I might get a better offer.

01:18:40.492 --> 01:18:48.892
# Just Molly and me,
and baby makes three. #

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:57.612
# We're happy in my blue heaven. #

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.460
- She hasn't got your smile, Roger.
- Oh, sure, she's good-looking.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.916
- Still sorry she wasn't a boy?
- Hm?

01:19:04.421 --> 01:19:05.948
A boy.
What do you mean a boy?

01:19:07.428 --> 01:19:09.740
Did you hear that? You wanted a boy.
I didn't want no boy.

01:19:10.428 --> 01:19:12.597
Trina's Daddy's little girl,
aren't you, Trina?

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.603
Roger, be careful now.

01:19:37.497 --> 01:19:38.642
Hello!

01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.775
- Hello, Miss Oliver.
- How do you do, Mrs. Adams.

01:19:46.776 --> 01:19:47.872
Come in.

01:19:48.736 --> 01:19:51.524
Thank you so much for letting us know
you were coming this time.

01:19:54.914 --> 01:19:56.943
- Hello, Miss Oliver.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Adams.

01:19:57.066 --> 01:19:59.776
Trina, this is your fairy godmother,
Miss Oliver.

01:20:00.494 --> 01:20:05.034
Hello, sweetheart.
Yes, she's not very timid, is she?

01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:09.453
I can plainly see that she
adores her father.

01:20:10.099 --> 01:20:11.890
She means everything to us.

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.385
What's the matter, got a cold?

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.195
Yes, you do. Everything.

01:20:16.357 --> 01:20:17.989
When are we going to own her outright?

01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:21.375
- You go before the judge the 27th.
- 27th, eh?

01:20:21.498 --> 01:20:25.041
- You'll want to see these charts.
- Yes.

01:20:31.502 --> 01:20:33.531
One you can send back to us.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:39.225
And the other you'll file with the court,
at the court with the final papers.

01:20:40.988 --> 01:20:43.969
These are the same questions
that you answered last year.

01:20:44.097 --> 01:20:45.683
I just want to bring them up to date.

01:20:47.378 --> 01:20:49.072
Now let's see.

01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:50.313
Religion?

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:52.898
Same.

01:21:02.072 --> 01:21:03.420
Age?

01:21:04.941 --> 01:21:07.764
- One year older.
- I have that.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.839
Profession?

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:13.084
Still publisher, isn't it?

01:21:14.028 --> 01:21:15.094
Yes.

01:21:18.692 --> 01:21:20.278
Income?

01:21:24.272 --> 01:21:25.779
Income?

01:21:27.619 --> 01:21:29.365
Well, you see, Miss Oliver...

01:21:30.091 --> 01:21:31.156
None.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.651
Oh, that's the way it is
in the newspaper game, Miss Oliver.

01:22:01.676 --> 01:22:03.520
Specially when you're starting
one of your own.

01:22:04.308 --> 01:22:07.151
You have to close down once
before you really get going.

01:22:07.495 --> 01:22:11.517
Oh, it's only temporary. I'm having a jam
with my wholesale paper mill.

01:22:11.641 --> 01:22:14.571
First thing you know
I'll have it humming by the 27th.

01:22:16.184 --> 01:22:17.809
It's only closed for a while.

01:22:21.027 --> 01:22:23.539
I'm sure you'll find a way,
Mr. Adams.

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:29.617
But you and I have to prove
to the judge

01:22:29.618 --> 01:22:32.705
that your income is enough
to take care of Trina.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:37.028
You know we gave everything
Trina needed.

01:22:37.148 --> 01:22:39.072
no matter who else had to suffer
around here.

01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:41.861
I realize that.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.665
Well, I must go now.
That's all we can do today.

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:57.264
Could I drive you to the train?

01:22:57.395 --> 01:22:59.762
No, thank you.
I really like to walk.

01:23:00.664 --> 01:23:04.987
This country air is so fresh.
Good bye.

01:23:13.398 --> 01:23:16.642
The battle axe.
She doesn't want us to have Trina.

01:23:16.965 --> 01:23:18.412
Yes, she does, darling.

01:23:22.226 --> 01:23:23.833
Oh yes, she does.

01:25:47.039 --> 01:25:50.217
///Better prepare your facts.

01:25:51.428 --> 01:25:53.063
- The option receipt. The Adams case.
- What?

01:25:53.574 --> 01:25:55.023
The Adams case.

01:25:55.847 --> 01:25:57.143
Oh, yes, yes.

01:25:58.343 --> 01:25:59.970
And if either one or both
of you gentlemen conduct yourselves

01:25:59.971 --> 01:26:03.235
like you've been doing today
I'll hold you in contempt, the both of you.

01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:17.692
Oh, this is the child in question.

01:26:25.067 --> 01:26:26.860
Yes, I see, hm...

01:26:32.897 --> 01:26:36.339
Looking over these adoption papers here

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.130
I see that you have no income
at present.

01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:41.618
Is that correct?

01:26:41.765 --> 01:26:43.060
Yes, Your Honor.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.711
What is this, Miss Oliver?

01:26:44.712 --> 01:26:47.302
You know this case
should never have come before me.

01:26:47.903 --> 01:26:51.560
Well, Your Honor,
I feel that this is a special case.

01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:53.976
I kept hoping until the last minute...

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:56.763
that Mr. Adams might be able
to resume the run of his paper

01:26:56.764 --> 01:26:58.458
or get a job.

01:26:58.459 --> 01:27:02.727
But unfortunately he hasn't been able
to do either, so I thought...

01:27:02.728 --> 01:27:06.134
Under these conditions
I can't grant the adoption.

01:27:07.225 --> 01:27:10.519
This child will have to revert
to the orphanage.

01:27:11.079 --> 01:27:13.207
Will you draw up a chair, please,

01:27:13.208 --> 01:27:17.393
while I prepare these
release papers for you to sign?

01:27:25.328 --> 01:27:27.232
It's just a matter of routine.

01:27:42.147 --> 01:27:43.132
If you please, Your Honor...

01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:45.487
it can't just be a matter of routine

01:27:45.488 --> 01:27:47.580
for people to have their baby
taken away from them.

01:27:48.524 --> 01:27:51.649
This child is ours, Judge.

01:27:52.849 --> 01:27:53.960
But those are the requirements of the law.

01:27:56.101 --> 01:27:59.637
Yes, but you see, we've had her
since she was 6 weeks old.

01:27:59.767 --> 01:28:00.851
It just doesn't seem reasonable

01:28:00.852 --> 01:28:03.725
that we should have to give her
back now to strangers.

01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:06.938
Mr. Adams, you are not here
to plead your case.

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:12.278
You've had the regular opportunity
to prove your fitness to provide.

01:28:14.434 --> 01:28:17.416
We are fit, Judge,
if you just look at the record.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.209
Without any income I have no alternative.

01:28:23.243 --> 01:28:25.543
Didn't you make that clear, Miss Oliver?

01:28:25.674 --> 01:28:27.702
Yes, Your Honor, I did.
But I thought...

01:28:27.826 --> 01:28:30.127
I'm sorry, but that is the law.

01:28:48.758 --> 01:28:51.826
Look, Your Honor, she's not like
an automobile, or an icebox

01:28:51.837 --> 01:28:53.749
or a piece of furniture or something
you buy on time...

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:56.484
and then when you can't keep up
the payments they take it away from you.

01:28:57.685 --> 01:28:59.510
Now sit still and be a good girl.

01:29:00.077 --> 01:29:02.219
Anyone could give up
those kinds of things.

01:29:02.548 --> 01:29:04.973
But I ask you, Judge,
how can you give up your own child?

01:29:05.238 --> 01:29:08.325
She is our child just as much
as if she'd been born to us.

01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:12.103
No, Daddy isn't going to go away, dear.

01:29:16.657 --> 01:29:20.001
Look, judge, we've had her
over a year now.

01:29:20.443 --> 01:29:23.469
Why, we walked the floor with her
when she had the colic.

01:29:23.871 --> 01:29:26.659
We've lost nights of sleep worrying
every time she had got a tooth.

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.161
We've gone through everything.

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:30.454
Everything that real parents have
with one of their own.

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:33.629
Ask Miss Oliver here about the inspections
we've had to have.

01:29:34.194 --> 01:29:36.744
Her weight charts,
her vaccination certificates...

01:29:36.864 --> 01:29:39.211
her toys, her dresses, her toothbrush.

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.532
They come around regularly
and check up on all those things

01:29:41.533 --> 01:29:43.373
to see if we're taking care
of her properly.

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:47.262
How many real parents can keep one
of their own and go through that?

01:29:48.582 --> 01:29:50.512
And you sit there
and say it's a matter of routine

01:29:50.513 --> 01:29:51.809
for you to take her away from us.

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.473
Please, Mr. Adams.

01:29:58.187 --> 01:29:59.899
I'm sorry, Judge.

01:30:04.184 --> 01:30:05.280
But...

01:30:07.274 --> 01:30:10.183
Well, you see, we weren't
as fortunate as most people.

01:30:11.579 --> 01:30:13.981
We would have had
one of our own, only...

01:30:14.727 --> 01:30:18.107
You don't know how badly
my wife wanted a child.

01:30:18.992 --> 01:30:21.336
It wasn't so important to me, I...

01:30:21.504 --> 01:30:23.167
I don't know, I suppose most men
are like this.

01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:25.260
Children never meant a great deal to me.

01:30:25.389 --> 01:30:27.590
I like them, all right, I suppose, but...

01:30:28.597 --> 01:30:31.001
Well, what I'm trying to say is,
Your Honor...

01:30:31.002 --> 01:30:33.272
the first time I saw her...

01:30:35.134 --> 01:30:37.655
she looked so little and helpless...

01:30:38.163 --> 01:30:41.504
I didn't know babies were so little.

01:30:43.344 --> 01:30:45.908
And then when she took hold of
my finger and held on to it, she...

01:30:45.909 --> 01:30:47.641
she just sort of walked
into my heart, Judge,

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.235
and she was there to stay.

01:30:49.236 --> 01:30:52.143
I didn't know I could feel like that

01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:58.123
I had always been kind of
careless and irresponsible.

01:30:58.609 --> 01:31:00.717
I wanted to be a bigshot.

01:31:01.758 --> 01:31:04.705
I couldn't work for anybody, I had to be
my own boss, that sort of thing.

01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:11.079
Now here I am standing
in front of a judge...

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.198
pleading for just a little longer
so that I can prove to you...

01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:15.962
I can support a little child
that doesn't weigh quite 20 lbs.

01:31:22.523 --> 01:31:25.246
It's not only for my wife and me
I'm asking you to let us keep her, Judge,

01:31:25.247 --> 01:31:26.820
it's for her sake too.

01:31:28.023 --> 01:31:29.763
She doesn't know any parents but us.

01:31:29.764 --> 01:31:31.657
She wouldn't know
what had happened to her.

01:31:32.606 --> 01:31:34.671
You see, there are so many
little things about her...

01:31:34.672 --> 01:31:37.362
nobody would understand her
the way Julie and I do.

01:31:38.106 --> 01:31:40.136
We love her, Judge.

01:31:40.735 --> 01:31:42.628
Please don't take her away from us.

01:31:44.842 --> 01:31:47.025
I'm not a bigshot now, I....

01:31:47.054 --> 01:31:49.505
I'll do anything.
I'll work for anybody.

01:31:50.382 --> 01:31:52.729
I'll beg, I'll borrow, I'll....

01:31:53.850 --> 01:31:57.794
Please, Judge, I'll sell anything I've got
until I get going again.

01:31:58.313 --> 01:32:00.694
She'll never go hungry,
she'll never be without clothes...

01:32:00.824 --> 01:32:02.933
not as long as I've got
two good hands to help me.

01:33:24.124 --> 01:33:26.567
- She's yours, dear.
- Ours!

01:33:28.161 --> 01:33:29.519
Now and forever.

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:35.432
Oh, Trina!

01:33:37.396 --> 01:33:40.943
Nothing can ever take her
from us now.

01:34:08.703 --> 01:34:12.369
You better hurry up, Daddy.
Mommie'll be home any minute now.

01:34:12.389 --> 01:34:15.413
Yeah. You go and watch for her.
Let me know when she comes, hm?

01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:22.847
- How are you getting along, Applejack?
- Ain't she a beauty?

01:34:27.043 --> 01:34:30.146
- Here she comes.
- Now? Well, let's get the presents, quick.

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.540
Here she comes.
We'll get them later.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.549
Where is everybody?

01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:02.546
Quick!

01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:05.181
Trina?

01:35:07.779 --> 01:35:08.925
Trina?

01:35:09.534 --> 01:35:12.196
Where can everybody be
this time of the day?

01:35:12.197 --> 01:35:13.477
Surprise!

01:35:13.603 --> 01:35:15.669
Surprise!
Happy birthday!

01:35:15.684 --> 01:35:17.079
Happy birthday, darling.

01:35:18.071 --> 01:35:20.666
- Oh, thank you.
- Sit down. Let's see the presents.

01:35:20.667 --> 01:35:22.996
I had almost forgotten today
was my birthday.

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:26.864
- This is from Daddy.
- Daddy?

01:35:31.654 --> 01:35:35.636
Why, Roger,
I always wanted one like that.

01:35:39.872 --> 01:35:41.618
- Look Applejack.
- I'm glad you like it, darling.

01:35:42.823 --> 01:35:45.455
And this is from Uncle Applejack.

01:35:45.855 --> 01:35:47.569
From Applejack?

01:35:48.487 --> 01:35:51.630
Oh, I think I can guess what this is.

01:35:52.557 --> 01:35:54.144
Handkerchief.

01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:57.219
Oh, it's beautiful, Applejack.

01:35:57.304 --> 01:36:01.286
I always figured a person can't have
too many handkerchiefs.

01:36:01.532 --> 01:36:02.848
Thank you.

01:36:05.401 --> 01:36:08.067
- And this is from me.
- From you?

01:36:11.504 --> 01:36:13.728
I can't imagine what this is.

01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:15.523
What on earth can...

01:36:16.810 --> 01:36:20.271
I got you a record,
as you love records.

01:36:20.679 --> 01:36:24.106
And 'cause you and Daddy
love each other so much.

01:36:24.988 --> 01:36:29.288
Oh, Trina, that's sweet, darling.
Thank you.

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:31.526
- Come on, let's play it see how it goes.
- Come on, Trina.

01:36:34.781 --> 01:36:37.548
Dinner's ready. Come and get it
or I'll throw it in the crate

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:40.203
Oh, this is wonderful!

01:36:40.326 --> 01:36:42.996
Dinner in my own home
and I didn't have to cook it.

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:48.676
Well.

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:08.697
We sure changed the complexion
of that bird.

01:37:08.728 --> 01:37:10.178
We certainly did.

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:13.366
What did you do
in school today, darling?

01:37:13.695 --> 01:37:17.814
Oh, I almost forgot. I was choosed.
I'm going to be in the Christmas play.

01:37:20.875 --> 01:37:22.304
In the Christmas play.

01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:23.980
What are you going to do?

01:37:24.226 --> 01:37:26.257
I'm going to sing in the carol.

01:37:27.158 --> 01:37:29.063
Why, Trina, that's wonderful.

01:37:29.192 --> 01:37:31.759
It'll be fun making you a carol's costume.

01:37:31.786 --> 01:37:34.895
I don't need any costume.
Nobody sees me.

01:37:35.976 --> 01:37:37.651
Nobody sees you?

01:37:37.652 --> 01:37:40.721
All I have to wear is a clean dress
and some sneakers.

01:37:40.882 --> 01:37:41.948
I'm the echo.

01:37:42.718 --> 01:37:47.539
I'm a way off behind the scene.
You only hear my voice.

01:37:47.685 --> 01:37:53.195
Miss Hopkins says it gives
a faraway sound like angels in heaven.

01:37:53.608 --> 01:37:55.694
Well, why do you have
to wear the sneakers?

01:37:55.922 --> 01:37:58.050
The sneakers are so I'll be quiet.

01:37:58.176 --> 01:38:02.739
I have to walk up in the sky behind
a cloud and take a big star with me.

01:38:02.963 --> 01:38:05.292
Then, when I get over the manger,
I stop.

01:38:05.456 --> 01:38:07.247
And then the angels sing.

01:38:07.371 --> 01:38:10.240
And when my turn comes,
I sing the echo.

01:38:10.241 --> 01:38:14.028
Then I sneak off quietly.
And next year, when I'm big...

01:38:14.029 --> 01:38:18.653
I get to be an angel
and wear an angel suit.

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:20.932
I'll get seen then.

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:26.228
Of course you'll get seen then,
darling.

01:38:26.518 --> 01:38:30.217
Is it a long time
until next year, Daddy?

01:38:30.348 --> 01:38:32.901
Oh, no, darling.
It'll be here in no time at all.

01:38:46.028 --> 01:38:47.921
Oh, I forgot.

01:38:48.279 --> 01:38:50.682
Oh my, what happened to the lights?
Shh!

01:38:50.811 --> 01:38:52.683
Did you see the lights go out?

01:38:53.066 --> 01:39:00.417
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

01:39:00.545 --> 01:39:06.404
Happy birthday, dear Mommy,
happy birthday to you.

01:39:12.773 --> 01:39:15.920
- Hurry up, Mommy.
- I'll park the car.

01:39:15.921 --> 01:39:18.574
All right. See you out front.
Come on, dear.

01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:57.133
I spoiled everything.

01:42:57.134 --> 01:43:01.690
Now Miss Hopkins won't let me
be an angel next year.

01:43:01.813 --> 01:43:04.539
- Yes, she will, darling.
- Certainly.

01:43:04.664 --> 01:43:07.891
I was talking to her.
She said you did fine.

01:43:08.016 --> 01:43:10.884
Why, you were better than
the rest of them put together.

01:43:10.885 --> 01:43:11.881
See?

01:43:12.165 --> 01:43:15.464
- Honest?
- Honest.

01:43:20.103 --> 01:43:24.399
Gee, I don't know what people
would do without Christmas.

01:43:24.869 --> 01:43:27.820
I don't know what we'd do
without you, honey.

01:47:04.289 --> 01:47:07.120
Would you please stop that door
from banging?

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:42.801
I wish you wouldn't go out.

01:47:45.093 --> 01:47:47.785
I've got to get out of here
and get some fresh air.

01:47:51.081 --> 01:47:53.542
Isn't that someone downstairs?

01:48:00.955 --> 01:48:02.523
There's someone at the front door.

01:48:20.458 --> 01:48:22.207
May I use your phone, please?

01:48:22.208 --> 01:48:24.501
Our car is stalled
and I'd like to call a taxi.

01:48:24.502 --> 01:48:27.049
It's right here on the balcony.
If you'll just walk around that way.

01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:28.046
Thank you.

01:48:30.041 --> 01:48:32.754
I saw your light burning
and we're in such a hurry.

01:48:46.689 --> 01:48:49.322
Cabs are always busy
on a night like this.

01:48:53.955 --> 01:48:55.749
I do hope we can get one.

01:48:55.872 --> 01:48:58.063
Tommy's in the Christmas play.

01:49:03.338 --> 01:49:05.449
I hope we don't get late, Mommy.

01:49:10.045 --> 01:49:13.548
Out car is right out in front.
I'll drive you over, if you like.

01:49:13.998 --> 01:49:17.268
Oh, that's very kind of you.
But it wouldn't be too much trouble?

01:49:17.269 --> 01:49:18.746
Not too much trouble.

01:49:19.644 --> 01:49:20.755
Come, dear.

01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.071
You can't start the car.
The battery's dead.

01:49:26.072 --> 01:49:27.564
I'll have to crank it.

01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:53.375
I do hope we're not late, Mama.

01:50:05.123 --> 01:50:07.175
I can't thank you enough.

01:50:07.176 --> 01:50:10.505
If you only knew what these things
mean to a child.

01:50:13.646 --> 01:50:15.137
Let's get out of here.

01:50:27.781 --> 01:50:28.932
Roger!

01:50:44.489 --> 01:50:45.840
What's the matter?

01:50:53.653 --> 01:50:55.413
Take the car on home.

01:50:58.543 --> 01:51:01.400
- Roger!
- I'm not coming home.

01:51:01.937 --> 01:51:05.046
I don't ever want to see anything
or anyone that reminds me.

01:51:07.886 --> 01:51:09.515
All right.

01:51:10.858 --> 01:51:12.166
Good bye.

01:51:23.175 --> 01:51:28.815
# We strolled the lane together #

01:51:28.816 --> 01:51:34.794
# laughed at the rain together. #

01:51:35.513 --> 01:51:41.023
# Sang love's refrain together #

01:51:41.881 --> 01:51:49.103
# We'll always be together. #

01:52:17.716 --> 01:52:23.960
# You were meant for me #

01:52:23.961 --> 01:52:32.331
# I was meant for you. #

01:52:33.567 --> 01:52:40.709
# Nature patterned you
and when she was done... #

01:52:40.710 --> 01:52:43.999
# you were... #
- Here's your tickets.

01:52:47.343 --> 01:52:50.031
Those cool songs kind of
take you back, don't they?

01:52:52.054 --> 01:52:54.065
Yes, they do take you back.

01:52:56.325 --> 01:52:58.537
Did you decide which ones
you're gonna keep

01:52:58.538 --> 01:53:00.372
and which ones you're gonna
leave for him?

01:53:02.154 --> 01:53:03.670
Funny, Applejack.

01:53:05.148 --> 01:53:07.321
I can't seem to divide them.

01:53:08.682 --> 01:53:10.574
They belong to both of us.

01:53:13.492 --> 01:53:15.459
Guess I'll just leave them.

01:53:18.402 --> 01:53:20.569
While I was listening downstairs there, I...

01:53:21.298 --> 01:53:25.280
I could remember just as clear
the first time I ever saw you.

01:53:25.877 --> 01:53:28.340
Roger brought you into the Bulletin...

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:31.166
and I was cussing and pounding
on that old machine.

01:53:32.816 --> 01:53:34.094
Gee, he didn't know we was all

01:53:34.095 --> 01:53:36.639
gonna get to know each other
so well then, did he?

01:53:37.408 --> 01:53:40.952
Would you get the rest of the things
out of the bedroom for me, please?

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.806
I don't blame you, Julie.

01:54:18.112 --> 01:54:20.203
I don't blame you at all.
You should leave me.

01:54:24.918 --> 01:54:27.076
Why don't you say it, honey?
It's all true.

01:54:28.651 --> 01:54:31.962
I haven't done any one of the big things
I planned to do for you.

01:54:33.104 --> 01:54:35.895
We're right where we started.
Still struggling.

01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:39.582
I've let you down all around, honey.

01:54:43.365 --> 01:54:47.086
All I needed to make it 100%
was for you to leave me.

01:54:48.096 --> 01:54:50.403
And I can't think of a reason
in the world for you not to.

01:54:53.147 --> 01:54:55.133
I'm licked, Julie.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:59.385
You're not licked, Roger.
It's just us.

01:55:00.294 --> 01:55:03.318
We're licked as far as
our being together is concerned.

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:08.042
When something really came along
that hit us hard enough

01:55:08.043 --> 01:55:10.799
we couldn't face it together.

01:55:18.602 --> 01:55:21.887
I needed you an awful lot
these last few days...

01:55:22.893 --> 01:55:24.855
but you've been miles away.

01:55:26.222 --> 01:55:30.787
I've been entirely alone
right here in this room with you.

01:55:30.915 --> 01:55:32.718
I know, dear.

01:55:48.845 --> 01:55:51.731
I wish I could do something
to help you two.

01:55:54.099 --> 01:55:56.336
It just hasn't worked out.

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:03.957
It did work out, Julie.

01:56:05.733 --> 01:56:08.253
Things were wonderful
until this happened to us.

01:56:09.143 --> 01:56:10.865
I don't know, I...

01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:15.354
I just haven't been able to think
straight for the last few days.

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:21.054
She was never sick before and then
all of a sudden it was all over.

01:56:25.422 --> 01:56:27.716
If there was only some way
that people could know

01:56:27.717 --> 01:56:29.511
a few days ahead
what was going to happen.

01:56:29.512 --> 01:56:30.508
Yes...

01:56:31.799 --> 01:56:33.760
Then the day before
she was taken sick...

01:56:33.885 --> 01:56:36.166
she asked me for a quarter
and I wouldn't let her have it.

01:56:37.495 --> 01:56:39.559
When she asked me to take her
to the movies I said no

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.253
run along, I'm too busy.

01:56:41.254 --> 01:56:44.650
I know, it was the same with me.

01:56:45.277 --> 01:56:47.798
I was trying on her angel costume and...

01:56:48.887 --> 01:56:51.854
she was so excited
she couldn't stand still.

01:56:52.617 --> 01:56:54.134
I scolded her.

01:56:54.382 --> 01:56:58.831
I said, I'll never try
another dress on you again.

01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:02.804
I never did.

01:57:13.621 --> 01:57:14.773
Yes?

01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:17.166
Oh...

01:57:19.043 --> 01:57:20.428
Hello?

01:57:21.864 --> 01:57:23.281
Miss Oliver.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.035
It's a very strange thing,
Mrs. Adams,

01:57:34.478 --> 01:57:39.465
but we have a little boy
who is just two years old.

01:57:45.747 --> 01:57:48.212
Well, it's the oddest thing.

01:57:48.237 --> 01:57:51.401
He's the exact image of the youngster
you asked for

01:57:51.402 --> 01:57:54.515
when you first wrote to me.
You remember?

01:57:56.338 --> 01:57:59.605
I have that old letter
in front of me now.

01:58:01.554 --> 01:58:05.916
Curly hair, blue eyes,
dimple...

01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:09.743
This is strictly off the record.

01:58:09.744 --> 01:58:14.427
But really, another couple
has the right to see him first.

01:58:15.450 --> 01:58:18.316
But he's such a remarkable baby that...

01:58:18.478 --> 01:58:23.986
I thought perhaps you and Mr. Adams
would like to take a look.

01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:26.512
Yes.

01:58:29.412 --> 01:58:31.098
Miss Oliver...

01:58:31.597 --> 01:58:34.786
please don't let that other couple
see him until we do, will you?

01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:38.245
I won't, my dear.

01:58:39.258 --> 01:58:40.947
Good bye.

01:59:01.473 --> 01:59:04.785
Well, if he's only two years old,
I'd better put up the gate again, hm?

01:59:04.951 --> 01:59:05.908
Yes.

01:59:06.034 --> 01:59:08.978
I wouldn't want the little fellow falling
down the stairs and breaking his arm.

01:59:09.448 --> 01:59:12.633
I guess we'd better get out the crib.

01:59:14.341 --> 01:59:17.047
As long as he's two years old,
he can sleep on this bed, can't he?

01:59:17.271 --> 01:59:18.618
Sure, sure.

01:59:19.978 --> 01:59:22.353
We won't have to put
the chairs around it.

01:59:22.597 --> 01:59:28.173
And over in that corner
I could put a little electric train.

01:59:29.305 --> 01:59:35.407
