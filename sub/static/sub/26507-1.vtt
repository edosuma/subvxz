WEBVTT

00:04.471 --> 00:06.888
(wind chimes)

00:06.889 --> 00:09.103
But Mom, you promised!

00:09.104 --> 00:13.108
I know I did Charlie, but I'm
sorry, I've gotta go to work.

00:32.095 --> 00:34.486
I'll have grandpa tell you a
bedtime story, okay?

00:34.487 --> 00:36.489
Okay.

00:36.814 --> 00:39.909
Come on, grandpa is good at
telling stories.

00:39.910 --> 00:41.382
You brush them toofs?

00:41.383 --> 00:42.765
Yes mama.

00:42.766 --> 00:44.085
Wash them pits?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.422
Yes mama.

00:45.423 --> 00:47.165
Trim that beard?

00:47.166 --> 00:50.141
Get out of here with that!

00:50.142 --> 00:54.146
Now you be a good boy for
grandpa, go to sleep and I'll
see you tomorrow, okay?

00:54.178 --> 00:56.481
After my bed time story.

00:56.482 --> 00:59.485
Yes, after your story.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.233
Love you.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.504
Love you.

01:05.504 --> 01:08.508
(The crazy lady and the lobster
show!)

01:13.377 --> 01:15.288
What the fuck was that for?

01:15.289 --> 01:19.293
Because I need you to listen for
a minute dad, I got called in, I
need you to watch Charlie.

01:20.337 --> 01:21.767
(Sigh)

01:21.768 --> 01:26.453
Listen, he's already in bed, he
brushed his teeth, but I
promised him a bed time story,
so I need you to do that for me.

01:27.972 --> 01:30.963
A bed time story, are you
fucking kidding me?

01:30.964 --> 01:33.107
No, I'm not, a bed time story.

01:33.108 --> 01:35.619
You're raising that kid to be a
pussy you know?

01:35.620 --> 01:38.347
What do you want me to do next,
make him a ba ba, powder his
ass,

01:38.348 --> 01:41.852
say goo goo ga ga and all that
shit?

01:43.172 --> 01:45.155
The kid needs a fucking job!

01:45.156 --> 01:48.618
Listen dad, don't do it for me,
do it for Charlie.

01:48.619 --> 01:52.623
You're old, impart some wisdom
on him, tell him what it was
like when Moses was around,

01:52.947 --> 01:55.950
I don't care just get it done,
please.

01:57.212 --> 01:58.439
(Sigh)

01:58.440 --> 02:00.942
Thank you.

02:04.311 --> 02:08.315
Look dad, can you just not fuck
this up, okay? I'm serious.

02:26.487 --> 02:30.490
Okay kiddo, mom say's I gotta
tell you a bed time story, are
you ready for this shit?

02:33.621 --> 02:36.624
Yeah grandpa, tell me a good
one.

02:43.306 --> 02:47.310
Well I can tell you there ain't
nothing good in this pile.
Nothing but a bunch of pussified
horse shit.

02:50.362 --> 02:54.144
How about I tell you an adult
fairy tale.

02:54.145 --> 02:56.096
An adult fairy tale?

02:56.097 --> 03:00.101
Well yeah. I mean if you think
that's something you're up for.

03:01.624 --> 03:05.272
You don't want me to read you
one of those pussy little baby
stories do ya?

03:05.273 --> 03:06.807
No.

03:06.808 --> 03:10.812
Well okay then. This story
starts with a guy named Charlie.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.468
Hey that's my name.

03:13.469 --> 03:15.723
Yep, mine too.

03:15.724 --> 03:17.939
No, your name's grandpa.

03:17.940 --> 03:21.627
Well I'm grandpa to you, to
other folks I'm Charlie.

03:21.628 --> 03:25.631
And this Charlie, he was about
to have the most amazing night
of his life.

03:26.244 --> 03:30.248
A night kind of like this one.
But this story starts in outer
space.

03:38.579 --> 03:41.331
(Music begins)

05:47.665 --> 05:49.368
(Alarm sounds)

05:49.369 --> 05:50.744
Computer!

05:50.745 --> 05:51.624
(computer sounds)

05:51.625 --> 05:53.964
Oh hey babes, sorry about the
rude awakening.

05:53.965 --> 05:57.969
But it seems our force field has
been compromised, and we've got
a baddy right on our tail.

05:58.716 --> 06:01.555
I'm going to go ahead and
suggest we take evasive action.

06:01.556 --> 06:05.560
Monitors up. Come on Space
Babes, let's see what we're up
against this time.

06:08.315 --> 06:12.318
All right! Dinner time! Three
BLT's! Butts, legs, and titties!

06:15.552 --> 06:16.991
It's another scrote!

06:16.992 --> 06:19.167
Well that really puts a wrinkle
in our plans.

06:19.168 --> 06:22.923
Gloss up babes, it's time to
play ball.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.426
(Rock drums)

06:27.372 --> 06:29.874
(All right!)

06:37.444 --> 06:39.650
(Record scratch)

06:39.651 --> 06:43.655
Prepare for death Space Babes,
there is no chance to escape!

06:44.427 --> 06:48.431
A space Babe is always prepared.
But death isn't on the agenda
today yam bag. At least, not for
us.

06:51.530 --> 06:55.915
Hey Babes I don't want to sound
testy, but I think we might be
dealing with a bigger load than
we can handle this time.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.962
We got a second scrote about to
join the party, and he's coming
in hard and fast!

07:00.022 --> 07:03.025
They always do seem to come in
pairs.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.317
Weapon's on standby.

07:09.318 --> 07:12.373
Armed and ready!

07:12.374 --> 07:13.716
Fire!

07:13.717 --> 07:15.526
(Lazers firing)

07:15.527 --> 07:16.454
(Explosion)

07:16.455 --> 07:17.333
Ragyna!

07:17.334 --> 07:19.336
On it!

07:21.259 --> 07:23.257
Computer, can you stabalize?

07:23.258 --> 07:27.261
No Babes, they've got us pretty
good. Frankly, I'm all out of
ideas.

07:27.338 --> 07:29.474
Typical. Here goes nothing.

07:29.475 --> 07:32.177
(Ships motor revs faster)

07:34.569 --> 07:37.572
Engage stalking mode!

07:40.781 --> 07:42.528
They're right on our tail!

07:42.529 --> 07:44.197
Hope they enjoy the view.

07:44.198 --> 07:48.172
(grunting)

07:48.173 --> 07:50.564
Weapon's on standby.

07:50.565 --> 07:51.996
Fire!

07:51.997 --> 07:54.716
(Lazers firing)

07:54.717 --> 07:56.700
(Explosion)

07:56.701 --> 07:58.748
Computer, status update!

07:58.749 --> 08:02.752
Energy levels are depleted and
their weapons are recharging.
It's been nice knowing you Space
Babes.

08:03.052 --> 08:05.057
It's now or never Babes.

08:05.058 --> 08:07.652
(Low energy alarm going off)

08:07.653 --> 08:11.657
Hold onto your hooters Babes.
Things might get a little silly.

08:17.229 --> 08:19.732
(Low energy alarm going off)

08:25.029 --> 08:28.032
Weapons recharging. Fire in
three!

08:30.037 --> 08:31.153
Two!

08:31.154 --> 08:33.639
(Boink!)

08:33.640 --> 08:36.224
(Sonic boom explosion)

08:36.225 --> 08:40.047
(Scrote's ships engines gearing
down)

08:40.048 --> 08:44.052
Spaaaaace Baaaaaaaabes!

08:47.648 --> 08:49.649
(Film projector starting)

08:52.328 --> 08:54.830
(Banjo music begins)

08:56.456 --> 09:00.460
The male of our species never
did amount to much. The start of
their existence is shrouded in
mystery.

09:03.651 --> 09:07.935
But it is important to our
future, to understand the way
they were, and the way they were
finally disposed of.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.762
(flatulence)

09:14.355 --> 09:18.359
For as long as time has been
recorded, they have been
regarded at unsavory, unruly,
and uncivilized.

09:23.538 --> 09:27.542
This was due to what was later
dubbed, the greates mistake of
our maker.

09:30.634 --> 09:34.445
They had the numbers, but we had
the brains.

09:34.446 --> 09:38.450
The more their agenda became
clear, the easier it became to
manipulate them.

09:39.438 --> 09:43.442
It wasn't until the year 3,000
that their true desires were
firmly exploited,

09:44.613 --> 09:48.617
and their reign of terror was
put to an end by a group of
brave babes.

09:49.525 --> 09:53.500
These babes lured them into a
large craft with the promise of
a free trip.

09:53.501 --> 09:57.505
To a newly discovered planet
filled with sandwiches, as far
as the eye could see.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.564
But unfortunately, due to a
mathmatical error-

10:04.565 --> 10:05.755
(Tires screeching)

10:05.756 --> 10:07.120
(Explosion)

10:07.121 --> 10:09.223
They didn't make it.

10:11.193 --> 10:15.197
But perhaps even more
unfortunate, some did survive.

10:17.112 --> 10:20.591
Now having gone many years
without a sandwich.

10:20.592 --> 10:24.191
And more importantly, without
the influence of babes,

10:24.192 --> 10:28.196
the fiew remaining survivors
raidly devolved into their true
forms.

10:29.619 --> 10:33.243
The forms in which we know them
to be today.

10:33.244 --> 10:37.195
They must be avoided at all
costs.

10:37.196 --> 10:41.200
They are unable to be reasoned
with, and will stop at nothing
to get what they want.

10:46.923 --> 10:50.382
And that is exactly why we can't
chance it Vanassa.

10:50.383 --> 10:54.338
Look, I'm not exactly excited
about it either, but what else
are we supposed to do?

10:54.339 --> 10:57.230
We don't have enough energy to
make it anywhere else.

10:57.231 --> 10:59.190
Computer, bring the monitor back
up.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.342
Sure thing!

11:01.343 --> 11:02.134
(Computer noises)

11:02.135 --> 11:03.661
Wow it sure looks inviting!

11:03.662 --> 11:06.997
Inviting or not, there is no way
we are going down there.

11:06.998 --> 11:09.917
So what, you just want to stay
put until we run out of energy
completely?

11:09.918 --> 11:14.643
Pushing that button blasted us
so far out into the backwoods of
the universe that we have no
choice but to go down there.

11:15.254 --> 11:18.654
Then you shouldn't have pushed
the button, it was pretty clear
about not wanting to be pushed.

11:18.655 --> 11:21.893
And what, let those bean bags
blast us to smithereens?

11:21.894 --> 11:23.716
At least we're light years away
from them now.

11:23.717 --> 11:27.524
Sometimes you have to put
yourself into a little bit of
danger to escape an immediate
threat.

11:27.525 --> 11:32.169
Look, I know that neither of you
remember the scrotes the days
before the sandwiching, but
trust me. You don't want to.

11:36.033 --> 11:40.037
That film pales in comparison to
how bad they really were,

11:40.521 --> 11:44.524
and there's no reason to believe
the men on this planet won't be
just as bad. Or worse!

11:46.640 --> 11:49.655
Come on Ragyna, they can't all
be that bad.

11:49.656 --> 11:51.992
Oh yes! Yes they can be!

11:51.993 --> 11:54.695
Computer, you're sure we can
refuel on this rock?

11:54.696 --> 11:57.561
According to the limited
information I have in my
database,

11:57.562 --> 12:01.566
the creatures that inhabit it do
seem to occasionally broadcast
an energy source that shows

12:02.820 --> 12:06.243
a strong possibility of working
as a direct alternate to our
host energy source.

12:06.244 --> 12:09.650
Unfortunately I am unable to
pinpoint exactly what it is, or
when it is broadcast.

12:09.651 --> 12:14.336
But your communicators have been
reprogrammed with the ability to
track it, and harvest it once
you are on it's surface.

12:15.196 --> 12:16.554
Well then it's settled.

12:16.555 --> 12:20.559
Computer, please dress us in
current Earth fashions and bring
us down, nice and easy.

12:20.987 --> 12:23.690
(Computer noises)

12:23.691 --> 12:25.693
(Ship engine firing up)

12:46.806 --> 12:49.701
All right, come on. Franky,
everybody, get in here.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.454
Time to eat.

12:51.455 --> 12:52.581
(Chicken screaming)

12:52.582 --> 12:54.574
Jeeze, where did you come from?

12:54.575 --> 12:57.177
Go get with your friends.

12:59.838 --> 13:03.842
Gotta grow nice and strong,
everybody eat.

13:35.178 --> 13:38.180
Oh yeah. Say hello to daddy
sugar tits.

13:47.010 --> 13:51.014
What's that girl? You want me to
do what?

13:51.689 --> 13:54.652
(Donkey neighs)

13:54.653 --> 13:56.655
Here?

13:57.940 --> 14:00.943
Okay, you're the boss.

14:06.068 --> 14:08.532
(Loud engine noises)

14:08.533 --> 14:11.028
Holy shit, what the hell was
that?

14:11.029 --> 14:12.652
(Chicken's yelling)

14:12.653 --> 14:15.455
Something ain't right.

14:21.868 --> 14:24.371
(Wood stressing)

14:29.728 --> 14:31.530
(Ship door opening)

14:50.743 --> 14:54.351
Come on Babes, dial up your
communicators to scanning mode.

14:54.352 --> 14:58.355
The sooner we can find this
energy source, the sooner we can
get back home.

14:58.563 --> 15:02.566
Holy asteroids, space women!
Three of them!

15:06.202 --> 15:10.206
Oh man, oh man, oh man, the
things I can do with three space
women?

15:12.906 --> 15:15.937
Dear Penthouse!

15:15.938 --> 15:18.105
(Harp's playing)

15:18.106 --> 15:20.609
(Heavy metal music begins)

16:14.928 --> 16:18.550
(She's a woman of a woman, she's
long and lean.)

16:18.551 --> 16:22.222
(Give's me so much loving that
she's causing a scene)

16:22.223 --> 16:25.870
(She's a woman of a woman, the
lady's so nice.)

16:25.871 --> 16:28.374
(Got me living in paradise!)

16:33.470 --> 16:36.054
(Harp's playing)

16:36.055 --> 16:38.462
Wait a second, I think I'm
picking something up.

16:38.463 --> 16:40.310
Yeah, me too.

16:40.311 --> 16:42.662
Me three, follow me Babes.

16:42.663 --> 16:44.681
Thank you Jesus.

16:44.682 --> 16:47.390
Thank you space Jesus!

16:47.391 --> 16:50.412
(Scanner whirring)

16:50.413 --> 16:52.591
There it is.

16:52.592 --> 16:53.942
Shit, oh shit.

16:53.943 --> 16:56.095
Stay!

16:56.096 --> 16:57.392
Don't shoot.

16:57.393 --> 17:00.143
Don't you shoot mister!

17:00.144 --> 17:02.287
Hang on Babes, I don't think
that's a weapon.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.919
Hey, watch it!

17:04.920 --> 17:08.598
No, definitely not a gun, but
definitely the source of the
energy we've been looking for.

17:08.598 --> 17:09.406
Then harvest it.

17:09.407 --> 17:11.231
On it, switching over to
extraction mode.

17:11.232 --> 17:12.622
Extraction mode?

17:12.623 --> 17:13.694
Touch it! Touch it first!

17:13.694 --> 17:15.022
What?

17:15.023 --> 17:16.367
Absolutely not!

17:16.367 --> 17:17.518
Why not?

17:17.519 --> 17:20.594
Because we don't even know what
it is. It could be dangerous.

17:20.595 --> 17:21.642
Use Protection!

17:21.643 --> 17:23.267
I got a rubber in my wallet.

17:23.268 --> 17:26.538
I don't need any protection. I'm
not afraid of this thing.

17:26.539 --> 17:30.543
Greetings Earth creature. My
name is Carrieola.

17:31.571 --> 17:34.770
(Squeaking noises)

17:34.771 --> 17:36.773
Oh man.

17:39.730 --> 17:41.106
He died?

17:41.107 --> 17:42.985
No, he just fainted.

17:42.986 --> 17:44.809
What did she do to him?

17:44.810 --> 17:48.894
Well Charlie he fainted because
what Carrieola did to him made
him feel something he'd never
felt before.

17:52.153 --> 17:53.454
Huh?

17:53.455 --> 17:55.869
I know you don't think much of
girls right now but-

17:55.870 --> 17:58.173
Heck no I don't, girls are
gross!

17:58.174 --> 18:02.178
Well I guarantee ya, you know
years to come, your opinion is
gonna change.

18:03.676 --> 18:05.436
Blech!

18:05.437 --> 18:07.900
Well we can wrap it right now if
ya want ya know. He died.

18:07.901 --> 18:09.963
The end. Go the fuck to sleep.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.772
Is that what you want?

18:11.773 --> 18:15.372
No, it's fine. I want to know
what happens next.

18:15.373 --> 18:17.260
Well okay then.

18:17.261 --> 18:20.764
He fainted, and the babes didn't
know what to do about it.

18:20.765 --> 18:24.769
So they moved him over to a nice
soft pile of hay, and tried to
figure out what to do next.

18:27.013 --> 18:30.151
Is it okay?

18:30.152 --> 18:34.156
I don't know. But the energy
source we were detecting is
nowhere to be found now.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.711
Why did you touch it?

18:35.712 --> 18:37.103
Because you told me to.

18:37.104 --> 18:38.759
I did not!

18:38.760 --> 18:41.455
Okay, scan complete, uploading
now.

18:41.456 --> 18:43.150
Whatever it was, we'll know soon
enough.

18:43.151 --> 18:46.154
Hang on Babes. I think it's
waking up.

18:51.136 --> 18:53.143
All right Earthling, where did
you hide it?

18:53.144 --> 18:55.846
Hide what?

18:55.847 --> 18:57.966
The energy source you were
broadcasting.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.443
Broadcasting?

18:59.444 --> 19:03.448
Yeah, broadcasting. Your antenna
was out, and we picked up your
signal, loud and clear.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.066
Antenna?

19:06.067 --> 19:07.338
for Salzaron's sake.

19:07.339 --> 19:07.970
(Computer noise)

19:07.971 --> 19:10.098
Computer, can we get those scan
results please?

19:10.099 --> 19:11.890
Sure thing Space Babes!

19:11.891 --> 19:14.787
Hang on, scan results? What did
you do to me?

19:14.788 --> 19:18.354
Computer: This is a hard one,
Babes. Unlike anything in my
database.

19:18.355 --> 19:20.753
Come on stop beating around the
bush, just tell us what we're
dealing with here.

19:20.754 --> 19:24.798
The appendage of the Earthling
does seem to be the carrier of
the alternate energy source you
are after.

19:25.978 --> 19:29.161
Well duh, but the signal's gone
limp. How do we get it back up?

19:29.162 --> 19:30.673
Wait, hang on a second.

19:30.674 --> 19:32.001
Touch it, touch it again!

19:32.002 --> 19:33.289
My Zob Ragyna.

19:33.290 --> 19:36.029
Actually, that's exactly what I
was gong to suggest.

19:36.030 --> 19:38.196
You can't be serious, what is
this thing?

19:38.197 --> 19:42.201
Now, now, now, now, now, now
hang on a cotton pickin minute!

19:44.218 --> 19:47.313
That thing, is my dick.

19:47.314 --> 19:50.105
And you can't just go around
grabbing them like that!

19:50.106 --> 19:54.109
And even if you could, once
you've grabbed it as many times
as you did, well-

19:54.977 --> 19:58.981
You gota give it a minute before
you can grab it again!

19:59.125 --> 20:01.212
It's sensitive.

20:01.213 --> 20:02.491
(Slimy goo noise)

20:02.492 --> 20:06.404
Explains the tears.

20:06.405 --> 20:10.409
Oh man, hang on a minute. I
don't know where ya'll are from,
but-

20:11.708 --> 20:13.827
We're not from here.

20:13.828 --> 20:17.832
Well I am. This here's my
parent's barn. My name's
Charlie.

20:20.468 --> 20:23.883
Greetings Charlie, I am Vanassa.

20:23.884 --> 20:26.887
Greetings Charlie, I'm Ragyna.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.964
Wow! That sure is an intersting
way of saying hello ya'll got.

20:37.912 --> 20:40.566
Down here most folks just shake
hands, but-

20:40.567 --> 20:44.571
Now listen. I can hardly make no
damn sense of any of this.

20:47.031 --> 20:49.902
But I think I can help ya'll out
if you'll let me.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.238
Of course Charlie.

20:51.239 --> 20:55.243
The energy that your doo-hicky
picked up, from my dick.

20:56.239 --> 20:58.617
That can make ya'lls ship run
and get ya back home ya say,
right?

20:58.618 --> 21:00.120
Yes.

21:00.694 --> 21:04.698
Okay. I think this energy is
what we down here call sexual
energy.

21:07.778 --> 21:09.457
Sexual arousal.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.418
But only when his antenna was
out.

21:11.419 --> 21:14.601
Yeah, once your antenna was
retracted the energy source was
gone.

21:14.602 --> 21:18.605
That's because that antenna, is
also, my dick.

21:20.786 --> 21:24.789
That's what it does when it's in
it's aroused state. It kinda
sticks out like that.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.073
Some fella's call it a boner.

21:27.074 --> 21:28.512
A boner?

21:28.513 --> 21:30.008
Yeah, a boner.

21:30.009 --> 21:34.013
And you're all like this? All of
the men on this planet?

21:34.201 --> 21:38.036
Well yeah, basically I guess.

21:38.037 --> 21:42.041
But hell, I think most
everybody's gonna be turned on
by you three.

21:42.670 --> 21:45.332
And we all got wieners.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.140
Wieners?

21:47.141 --> 21:50.144
Yeah! Dicks, cocks, rods.
Wieners!

21:51.860 --> 21:55.864
Then you must take us where we
may find more of these at once.
No matter how hard, or long-

21:55.868 --> 21:57.300
Or short!

21:57.301 --> 21:59.239
Or mediocre the journey.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.243
Listen, I got just the place for
ya'll. You Babes stick with me,
you'll be home in no time.

22:04.939 --> 22:06.266
Well, then it's settled.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.457
(Patriotic music begins)

22:07.458 --> 22:10.018
Charlie, we are the Space Babes
from outer space.

22:10.019 --> 22:11.786
We are not from here.

22:11.787 --> 22:15.790
Our visit to your planet was an
unfortunate error on our part
while fleeing a most dire
situation.

22:16.107 --> 22:20.111
We are here merely out of
circumstance. We wish your
planet no inconvenience.

22:21.323 --> 22:23.625
We are not here with any ill
intentions.

22:23.626 --> 22:25.828
No, we are here for your boners.

22:27.646 --> 22:31.650
Your dicks, your cocks, your
rods, now Charlie please!

22:32.638 --> 22:35.692
Take us, to your wieners.

22:35.693 --> 22:37.221
(Chicken boks)

22:37.222 --> 22:39.724
(Heavy metal music begins)

23:05.369 --> 23:08.372
(Crowd cheering)

23:12.193 --> 23:16.196
Ladies, welcome to the strip
club, A.K.A. your fueling
station.

23:18.104 --> 23:22.108
If you can't find sexual energy
in here, you ain't looking.

23:22.567 --> 23:26.319
Look! Rules are rules.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.324
The shit you two were doing up
there was breaking rules I
didn't even know I had!

23:31.328 --> 23:34.926
How the fuck did you get your
foot all the way up-

23:34.927 --> 23:38.251
And was your elbow actually
inside of her-

23:38.252 --> 23:42.255
Aw come on Jerimy, it's Saturday
night. You need all the talent
you can get in here right now.

23:45.571 --> 23:48.473
Yeah come on, we were just
having fun.

23:48.474 --> 23:52.478
And where in the hell did you
get so many kumquats this time
of year?

23:53.443 --> 23:57.447
Look, you ain't gonna find two
other girls tonight, you know
that. We ain't going nowhere.

23:59.706 --> 24:03.710
Oh yeah? You two, you're hired.

24:03.802 --> 24:07.806
If you young ladies would please
go see Danyelle in the dressing
room, thanks.

24:08.070 --> 24:12.074
You two, you're fired, get the
fuck out of my bar!

24:13.214 --> 24:15.709
You could at least call us a
cab.

24:15.710 --> 24:18.061
Your legs look fine from here
baby.

24:18.062 --> 24:21.065
Mmmm. Beat it!

24:29.302 --> 24:31.804
(Comedic music playing)

24:34.941 --> 24:36.604
(Sniffing sound)

24:36.605 --> 24:38.092
Aaahhh!

24:38.093 --> 24:39.852
What are you doing?

24:39.853 --> 24:42.491
I'm trying to pick up the scent!

24:42.492 --> 24:46.496
Uh, we have a computer for that.
Computer. Computer?

24:48.425 --> 24:49.732
(Buzzer sound)

24:49.733 --> 24:52.535
You have to be a Space Babe for
that to work.

24:52.536 --> 24:53.569
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

24:53.570 --> 24:54.960
(Clearing throat)

24:54.961 --> 24:56.757
(Now speaking in Carrieola's
voice)

24:56.758 --> 24:59.802
Computer, can you tell me where
the Space Babes are?

24:59.803 --> 25:01.090
(Computer noises)

25:01.091 --> 25:03.521
But Carrieola, you're a Space
Babe.

25:03.522 --> 25:06.525
Uh.. Uh.. Uhh..

25:07.899 --> 25:10.378
Tell her you forgot your panties
when you left!

25:10.379 --> 25:12.565
Huh huh, Yeah.

25:12.566 --> 25:13.425
(Clearing throat)

25:13.426 --> 25:14.230
(In Carrieola's voice)

25:14.231 --> 25:17.743
I forgot my panties, and then
um, I had to go poopy.

25:17.744 --> 25:19.159
(Computer noises)

25:19.160 --> 25:23.164
Okay then, the Space Babes are
located at Night Moves strip
club, in Bloomington Indiana.

25:23.944 --> 25:27.195
Huh huh, Huh huh.

25:27.196 --> 25:28.843
Ha ha, ha ha.

25:28.844 --> 25:31.446
To the strip club!

25:34.755 --> 25:37.714
Uh oh, he's right behind me
isn't he?

25:37.715 --> 25:40.067
He sure is.

25:40.068 --> 25:44.071
You scrotes better not be
jerking me around!

25:45.420 --> 25:49.423
Yes sir General Smotch sir! Dick
head! Sir!

25:49.699 --> 25:51.386
Don't be a suck up!

25:51.387 --> 25:53.210
Yep! All right.

25:53.211 --> 25:55.714
(Heavy metal music begins)

26:13.521 --> 26:16.706
Charlie: Okay. Now try not to
worry about your friends.

26:16.707 --> 26:19.002
I know Danyelle, she's a cool
chick.

26:19.003 --> 26:23.007
And with your friends dancing
tonight, I'm sure they'll raise
all kinds of energy.

26:23.871 --> 26:27.644
But there's also a lot of
emotions in here that could get
in the way.

26:27.645 --> 26:29.690
Carrieola: Emotions?

26:29.691 --> 26:33.695
Yeah, emotions. Jealousy,
desire, lust, love.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.870
Love?

26:37.871 --> 26:41.875
Man I don't know how to explain
love to you. Most people down
here don't even understand it.

26:42.991 --> 26:45.278
Can you try?

26:45.279 --> 26:49.283
Look, all I can tell you is what
my daddy told me about being in
love when I asked him.

26:50.249 --> 26:54.253
He said Charlie, when you're in
it, you know it.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.384
It's stronger than a grizzly
bear.

26:56.385 --> 27:00.389
And it'll tickle your tummy like
a whole herd of butterflies was
just let loose.

27:02.421 --> 27:06.424
He said when you're in love with
someone, there ain't nothing can
keep ya apart.

27:07.563 --> 27:09.931
Not even death.

27:09.932 --> 27:13.859
Hey there handsome, care for a
lap dance?

27:13.860 --> 27:16.746
No, not right now. Thank you.

27:16.747 --> 27:19.395
Okay sugar. If you change your
mind come and find me.

27:19.396 --> 27:21.171
My name's Candy.

27:21.172 --> 27:25.175
They call me Candy cause I taste
so sweet.

27:28.651 --> 27:31.146
(Boing! Boing! Boing!)

27:31.147 --> 27:35.151
I'm sensing slight arousal from
you Charlie. Why didn't you go
with her?

27:37.721 --> 27:41.725
I don't know. I think I'd rather
just stay with you and talk
awhile.

27:42.820 --> 27:46.824
You make me feel smart. And I
like teaching you about Earth.

27:50.108 --> 27:53.291
You are smart, and I like
learning from you.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.599
Now please, tell me what a lap
dance is.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.671
Danyelle: So lap dances are
twenty, don't let the douche
bags stiff you either.

27:58.672 --> 28:01.039
Gimmie gimme cash up front, if
you want to sniff this cunt.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.927
And you let 'em sniff it.

28:02.928 --> 28:06.931
It's a great time filler you do
that thing, you just stand
there, wiggle it around in their
faces.

28:07.232 --> 28:11.236
Every second you're doing that,
you're not having to rub your
ass up against their tiny limp
peckers.

28:12.735 --> 28:14.423
You two know each other, right?

28:14.424 --> 28:15.925
Yes.

28:16.551 --> 28:19.574
Okay. I'll make sure you get
paired up on stage together
then.

28:19.575 --> 28:22.077
On Stage?

28:22.607 --> 28:26.042
Holy shit. You two are green!

28:26.043 --> 28:27.866
Yeah the stage.

28:27.867 --> 28:29.398
It's like window shopping.

28:29.399 --> 28:31.090
for the customers, and for you.

28:31.091 --> 28:32.817
They'll tip you for your dance.

28:32.818 --> 28:34.817
If they like what they see,
they'll wanna go for a lap
dance.

28:34.818 --> 28:38.041
So try different stuff, see what
they're responding to.

28:38.042 --> 28:40.209
We got a lot of guys in here
that are into some weird shit.

28:40.210 --> 28:44.025
Yeah, I'd say. I got a guy
that'll pay me to piss on him.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.001
Says it's the only thing that
gets him hard.

28:46.002 --> 28:48.881
He likes it running down his
face, dripping off of his chin.

28:48.882 --> 28:51.305
There's all sorts of weird shit
out there.

28:51.306 --> 28:55.081
Hair, feet, armpit licking, and
pissing.

28:55.082 --> 28:57.696
I learn a new one every day.

28:57.697 --> 29:00.237
And that's when the men get
boners Charlie?

29:00.238 --> 29:02.249
Boners happen all the time in
here.

29:02.250 --> 29:06.253
But yeah, they're most likely
to, come up, during a lap dance.

29:08.045 --> 29:09.868
What about other women?

29:09.869 --> 29:11.370
No!

29:11.773 --> 29:14.948
Women don't have dicks.

29:14.949 --> 29:16.563
At least not, most of them.

29:16.564 --> 29:18.964
No, I mean can a woman get a lap
dance?

29:18.965 --> 29:22.968
Oh sure. And I imagine the
dancers love it when that
happens.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.482
Why?

29:24.483 --> 29:26.180
Women are softer.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.003
Women are better mannered.

29:28.004 --> 29:30.059
Women are-

29:30.060 --> 29:31.867
Women are the worst!

29:31.868 --> 29:35.973
They think because they got a
set of tits in here that they
can get away with whatever the
fuck they want.

29:36.016 --> 29:38.119
They'll reach right up, try and
grab you while you're on stage.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.526
You really gotta watch them,
more than the men.

29:40.527 --> 29:44.771
Give a lap dance to a bitch,
she'll try to cram her filthy
toothless mouth on your snatch
before you can say-

29:45.264 --> 29:49.268
Two screaming orgasms, courtesy
of Jerimy.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.399
You know he won't admit it, but
your friends really saved his
bacon.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.470
We're running pretty low on
talent in here these days.

29:55.471 --> 29:57.334
How are my friends doing?

29:57.335 --> 29:58.758
They're doing great.

29:58.759 --> 30:00.566
They'll actually be up on stage
next set.

30:00.567 --> 30:02.670
Is there anything else that I
can get you two?

30:02.671 --> 30:05.581
No thank you.

30:05.582 --> 30:07.084
Oh!

30:09.742 --> 30:11.661
Just holler if there's anything
else.

30:11.662 --> 30:14.165
Name's Sandy.

30:17.826 --> 30:19.873
You like her don't you?

30:19.874 --> 30:23.017
No, not really.

30:23.018 --> 30:27.022
With her, it's just the curse of
being a man.

30:27.441 --> 30:30.121
Curse?

30:30.122 --> 30:32.432
Yeah, curse.

30:32.433 --> 30:34.233
Take a look around.

30:34.234 --> 30:38.209
Plenty of smokin' hot babes in
here, all of them wearing next
to nothing.

30:38.210 --> 30:42.214
All of them willing to take it
off for a few bucks.

30:42.649 --> 30:45.532
And I want to see the waitress
naked.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.397
Because I can't.

30:47.398 --> 30:50.000
Men. Our eyes never get their
fill.

30:51.525 --> 30:54.924
We're constantly looking for
something else.

30:54.925 --> 30:58.929
Especially when it's something
we're not supposed to have.

30:59.564 --> 31:03.568
It's hard to explain but, she's
not who I want right now.

31:05.884 --> 31:08.887
Who do you want right now
Charlie?

31:12.284 --> 31:16.288
Ladies and germs, we got a
couple of cherries in here
tonight, ripe for the poppin'!

31:16.788 --> 31:20.792
That's right take those hands
off of your dicks, and do
something useful with them for
once.

31:21.048 --> 31:25.052
And put 'em together, and give a
warm sticky welcome to Ragyna,
and Vanassa.

31:27.911 --> 31:30.414
(Dramatic music)

32:00.226 --> 32:02.441
Well God damn!

32:02.442 --> 32:04.944
(Heavy metal music begins)

33:44.588 --> 33:46.339
(Boing! Boing!)

33:46.340 --> 33:49.498
I think it's working!

33:49.499 --> 33:53.303
It definitely is, but at this
rate it's going to take us days
to get the energy we need.

33:53.304 --> 33:55.446
Well, keep trying things.

33:55.447 --> 33:59.438
Maybe we can come across a
fetish or something, to help
raise the level.

33:59.439 --> 34:01.942
Hey baby.

34:01.943 --> 34:04.950
Why don't you come over here and
raise my level?

34:04.951 --> 34:07.014
Hey mister, what turns you on?

34:07.015 --> 34:09.525
Watching you wiggle.

34:09.527 --> 34:11.420
Did you get those panties in
space?

34:11.422 --> 34:14.516
Because that ass is out of this
world.

34:14.516 --> 34:17.020
From the second son of Salzaron
sugar!

34:20.543 --> 34:23.545
(Heavy metal guitar solo
playing)

34:33.699 --> 34:35.291
What's wrong?

34:35.292 --> 34:37.786
I don't know.

34:37.788 --> 34:41.792
It's like the energy is there,
but even with all these men,
it's not nearly as strong as
yours was.

34:43.458 --> 34:47.463
Well I guess that's just because
a boner made with love is more
powerful than your average
boner.

34:49.016 --> 34:53.018
And your boner was made with
love Charlie?

34:53.079 --> 34:54.726
Yeah.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.518
Yeah I think maybe it was.

34:57.519 --> 34:59.694
Damn girl!

34:59.695 --> 35:02.711
Why don't you come over here and
let me suck on them big ole
titties?

35:02.712 --> 35:04.398
These big ole titties?

35:04.399 --> 35:08.086
(Heavenly music)

35:08.087 --> 35:10.589
There is one other thing we
could try.

35:12.279 --> 35:14.669
It's kind of the ultimate
display of sexual energy.

35:14.670 --> 35:18.045
Something that we have to do
together.

35:18.046 --> 35:20.286
Oh baby, you are so wet.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.209
You're practically dripping
aren't you?

35:22.210 --> 35:24.681
I got a guy that will pay me to
piss on him.

35:24.682 --> 35:27.585
Oh, you like it wet?

35:27.586 --> 35:30.050
Oh god, do I?

35:30.051 --> 35:31.765
I wanna feel your wetness all
over my face!

35:31.766 --> 35:34.377
I wanna feel it, running down my
chin.

35:34.378 --> 35:36.981
You're so sweet I'd like that.

35:39.569 --> 35:42.372
I'd, love that. Let's do it.

35:44.338 --> 35:47.240
Let's get out of here.

35:51.321 --> 35:53.324
What's wrong?

35:53.325 --> 35:55.708
Look, I know ya'll are in a
hurry to get back home.

35:55.709 --> 35:58.292
But before we can, do it.

35:58.293 --> 36:01.260
You gotta meet my family.

36:01.261 --> 36:03.863
Of course Charlie, I'd love to.

36:06.389 --> 36:08.563
Come on, let's get on with it.

36:08.564 --> 36:12.412
Why don't you pull that string
to the side, let's see how wet
you really are.

36:12.413 --> 36:14.099
All right big boy.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.603
Here it comes.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.115
Okay.

36:20.116 --> 36:22.610
All right.

36:22.611 --> 36:25.114
(Heavy metal music ends)

36:40.446 --> 36:43.449
(Applause)

37:03.803 --> 37:06.305
Thank you.

37:10.436 --> 37:13.547
I can't believe that mother
fucker made us walk.

37:13.548 --> 37:16.571
Uh, we could have called a cab
ourselves ya know?

37:16.572 --> 37:18.755
Uh, and with what money?

37:18.756 --> 37:22.356
We would had money if you didn't
stop and buy all those chicken
nuggets.

37:22.357 --> 37:26.035
Well you weren't complaining
when you ate more than half of
those bitch!

37:26.036 --> 37:29.307
They're chicken nuggets, what
did you expect?

37:29.308 --> 37:30.251
(Bush shakes)

37:30.252 --> 37:31.531
Hey lady?

37:31.532 --> 37:33.562
Wait, what the fuck was that?

37:33.563 --> 37:35.731
Psst! Hey lady!

37:35.732 --> 37:38.434
Let's not stick around to find
out.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.846
God damn it!

37:42.847 --> 37:46.822
Help me pick up all these
fucking kumsquats skank!

37:46.823 --> 37:50.414
Fuck you, I ain't picking that
shit up, can pick that shit up
your damn self.

37:50.415 --> 37:52.558
Pardon me.

37:52.559 --> 37:55.870
Well then you can go fuck off
and die bitch!

37:55.871 --> 37:58.541
(Heavy metal music begins)

37:58.542 --> 38:00.429
(Eating sounds)

38:00.430 --> 38:01.701
(Female screaming)

38:01.702 --> 38:03.326
Hey come on, let me get some!

38:03.327 --> 38:05.262
What?

38:05.263 --> 38:07.910
Where you going?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.913
(Female screaming)

38:12.311 --> 38:14.313
Lady!

38:16.210 --> 38:20.214
Don't worry, soon we will feast
on the flesh of Space Babes!

38:21.698 --> 38:24.300
To the strip club!

38:32.651 --> 38:36.655
Dear Lord, we thank you for this
day you've even given us.

38:37.555 --> 38:41.559
We thank you for all the work
you've provided to me.

38:41.791 --> 38:45.795
So I can take care of these,
good for nothin' kids.

38:47.855 --> 38:51.859
And we thank you Jesus, for uh,
the food.

38:52.807 --> 38:55.958
Mother Margo has prepared for
us.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.398
And Lord, we thank ya for
looking over us.

38:59.399 --> 39:03.403
I personally want to thank you,
sweet Jesus.

39:03.454 --> 39:06.056
For Charlie.

39:06.494 --> 39:09.909
Finally bringing home a girl.

39:09.910 --> 39:10.957
It's uh.

39:10.958 --> 39:14.962
Well as you know we've worried
for quite some time that he may
be queer.

39:16.266 --> 39:20.270
Verdict's still out on Shawn
over there, but I suppose two
out of three ain't bad.

39:22.809 --> 39:26.813
And lastly Jesus, I wanna thank
you for makin' sure that all of
us were borned right here in
America.

39:30.729 --> 39:34.488
The greatest nation on this here
earth.

39:34.489 --> 39:36.080
Amen to ya.

39:36.081 --> 39:37.560
Amen.

39:37.561 --> 39:39.479
Amen.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.988
So Blondie, you're a uh.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.972
A hooker, right?

39:44.973 --> 39:47.479
Am I a hooker Charlie?

39:47.480 --> 39:48.891
Dad!

39:48.892 --> 39:50.475
I'm just saying!

39:50.476 --> 39:53.279
I mean come on, look at you.

39:54.916 --> 39:56.396
And look at her.

39:56.397 --> 39:57.499
Look at you!

39:57.500 --> 40:00.179
Look at her!

40:00.180 --> 40:01.899
No, no she's not a hooker!

40:01.900 --> 40:03.498
You're not a hooker.

40:03.499 --> 40:04.907
You a cop?

40:04.908 --> 40:06.019
Am I a cop?

40:06.020 --> 40:07.851
No, she's not a cop either!

40:07.852 --> 40:09.283
God damn!

40:09.284 --> 40:13.288
Can we just please, talk about
something normal for once?

40:15.891 --> 40:19.446
I mean, I brought a girl here,
that's kinda rare to do.

40:19.447 --> 40:21.550
Thought you'd all be on your
best behaivor.

40:21.551 --> 40:24.754
How long until that damned
turkey's done?

40:29.631 --> 40:33.262
Your mother shit herself today.

40:33.263 --> 40:35.365
Your mother shit herself today!

40:38.199 --> 40:40.549
Hey Shawn, how was school?

40:40.550 --> 40:42.295
I told you, my name isn't Shawn
anymore.

40:42.296 --> 40:43.629
It's Aztaroth!

40:43.630 --> 40:46.877
(Hissing)

40:46.878 --> 40:49.631
Jessica. How was your day?

40:51.086 --> 40:53.488
Oh you know, I got fucked!

40:55.441 --> 40:56.865
Can we have sex now?

40:56.866 --> 40:59.424
Hooker! Definitely a hooker.

40:59.425 --> 41:02.428
Hooker! Ha ha, Hooker ha ha!

41:03.913 --> 41:06.800
Shh. Shh Mama, mama!

41:06.801 --> 41:10.040
I want to introduce you to
Carrieola. She's-

41:10.041 --> 41:12.444
She's not from here.

41:14.393 --> 41:17.511
She needs our wieners!

41:17.512 --> 41:19.984
She needs boners!

41:19.985 --> 41:23.216
To fuel her spaceship!

41:23.217 --> 41:24.904
A spaceship.

41:24.905 --> 41:26.124
That runs.

41:26.125 --> 41:27.324
On.

41:27.325 --> 41:29.327
Boners!

41:34.652 --> 41:36.683
That's nice mama.

41:36.684 --> 41:39.259
That's real nice.

41:39.260 --> 41:43.163
You know when you born Charlie
we weren't sure if you'd be able
to have sex ever.

41:43.164 --> 41:45.923
Pecker was so small, it wouldn't
even stick out.

41:45.924 --> 41:47.410
Didn't even stick out.

41:47.411 --> 41:49.770
Nope, not one iota.

41:49.771 --> 41:53.466
Hell, we thought you were a girl
that first few hours.

41:53.467 --> 41:55.235
Okay that is not true.

41:55.236 --> 41:56.275
That's not true.

41:56.276 --> 41:57.163
Sure!

41:57.164 --> 41:58.315
Wasn't nothin' down there!

41:58.316 --> 42:00.291
You were like a damned
mannequin!

42:00.292 --> 42:02.118
We were about to take matters
into out own hands.

42:02.119 --> 42:05.550
Hell, three seconds more and you
would've been Charlene!

42:05.551 --> 42:09.030
I was passing you off to your
ma, she was gonna hold you
still.

42:09.031 --> 42:12.533
While your granny sliced into
that-

42:12.534 --> 42:16.538
Weird, smooth mound of skin you
had down there.

42:18.550 --> 42:20.549
And she was gonna, well.

42:20.550 --> 42:22.318
Build you a cooter!

42:22.319 --> 42:23.278
Build you a cooter.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.390
Yep, that's right.

42:25.391 --> 42:29.394
But, there wasn't to be any
cooter in his future.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.213
Still ain't!

42:31.214 --> 42:34.725
No, I was so drunk, I didn't
notice your mama had a beer in
her hand.

42:34.726 --> 42:35.829
She botched the catch.

42:35.830 --> 42:39.805
Dropped you right to that hard
hospital floor.

42:39.806 --> 42:42.757
You fell about three feet,
dented in your skull a little
bit.

42:42.758 --> 42:45.389
We had to give it one of these,
to get it to pop back out.

42:45.390 --> 42:46.693
But I tell you what.

42:46.694 --> 42:47.789
You're a Bryant!

42:47.790 --> 42:49.269
And we Bryant's are tough!

42:49.270 --> 42:51.565
Persistent!

42:51.566 --> 42:54.284
No sir, you hit that linoleum
and-

42:54.285 --> 42:55.565
(Ding!)

42:55.566 --> 42:57.853
Turkey's done!

42:57.854 --> 43:01.037
I don't know where they got that
many kumquats this time of year.

43:01.038 --> 43:01.969
Pardon me.

43:01.970 --> 43:05.257
Three bucks cover, two drink
minimum.

43:05.258 --> 43:09.262
But seriously, you're our best
girl, I would never let that
kind of thing happen to you.

43:09.672 --> 43:12.175
(Heavy metal music begins)

43:33.731 --> 43:36.835
Man, I can't believe these
disguises worked!

43:36.836 --> 43:40.587
Well you'd be surprised what
these humans would fall for.

43:40.588 --> 43:41.475
They're stupid.

43:41.476 --> 43:45.082
I told you bitch, no one lays a
hand on my shit or they get's
their ass kicked!

43:45.083 --> 43:47.099
How the fuck was I supposed to
know they were yours?

43:47.100 --> 43:49.347
Because they was in my fucking
locker cunt!

43:49.348 --> 43:50.707
Bitch I took one!

43:50.708 --> 43:54.243
It was only a six piece, you
think fucking chicken nuggets
grow on trees?

43:54.244 --> 43:55.705
Took some of them fries too.

43:55.706 --> 43:57.606
That does it skank!

43:57.607 --> 43:59.363
(Punch)

43:59.364 --> 44:00.762
You hit like a girl!

44:00.763 --> 44:04.767
Hey, hey, break it up, break it
up, break it up!

44:06.938 --> 44:10.678
Listen there's no fighting in
here.

44:10.679 --> 44:14.683
I'll send Danyelle out to get
you another six piece each.

44:15.031 --> 44:17.982
And a large fry?

44:17.983 --> 44:19.886
And a large fry doll.

44:19.887 --> 44:21.101
Each?

44:21.102 --> 44:22.909
Each.

44:22.910 --> 44:26.692
Now, you know the rules.

44:26.693 --> 44:28.374
That's it.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.757
Let's get this over with now.

44:30.758 --> 44:33.561
Let's kiss and make up.

44:48.316 --> 44:49.902
Kiss her again!

44:49.903 --> 44:53.774
(Cheering)

44:53.775 --> 44:56.778
(Cheering)

45:02.623 --> 45:05.625
Let us feast, I say we strike
now!

45:06.983 --> 45:09.150
Patience my brother.

45:09.151 --> 45:11.413
The Space Babes are who we are
here for.

45:11.414 --> 45:13.813
We must not rush into this.

45:13.814 --> 45:17.818
Well, as long as we got some
time to kill, I think I'll have
a beer!

45:19.970 --> 45:23.777
Yeah, but seriously Charlie,
hooker or not.

45:23.778 --> 45:27.782
That sure is one fine piece of
tail you brought over, boy oh
boy.

45:28.457 --> 45:32.249
I mean, most sane man would kill
to have a go at that.

45:32.250 --> 45:35.880
Hell I'd, I tell ya, I'd.

45:35.881 --> 45:39.884
I'd murder this whole fuckin'
family just to knock boots with
her.

45:41.090 --> 45:45.093
In fact I'd felch my own son's
salty semen straight outta her
dirty hooker cunt.

45:46.505 --> 45:50.008
Just to get a look at what she's
sportin' down there.

45:50.009 --> 45:52.168
Oh geeze thank's dad.

45:52.169 --> 45:56.173
That's awfully kind of you to
say, I'm so glad I brought her
to meet you guys.

45:56.189 --> 45:59.459
Come on Charlie, I'm just
breakin' your balls, huh?

45:59.460 --> 46:01.795
Before she drains 'em!

46:01.796 --> 46:05.800
But seriously Charlie, I uh, I'm
real proud of you.

46:06.428 --> 46:10.432
For uh, well bringing home some
quality trim that nobody in this
family could ever have gotten.

46:13.012 --> 46:14.531
I sure do appreciate it.

46:14.532 --> 46:18.091
It means a lot to me, and your
mother there.

46:18.092 --> 46:19.955
Well-

46:19.956 --> 46:22.522
I'm proud of you son.

46:22.523 --> 46:24.662
Thank's dad.

46:24.663 --> 46:27.814
Thanks dad.

46:27.815 --> 46:29.327
Quite proud.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.798
In fact you're the only son I
can say that about.

46:32.799 --> 46:36.770
Old asterisk over there, is such
a fucking water head.

46:36.771 --> 46:40.775
I can't even count him as a
person, he's that dumb.

46:40.939 --> 46:43.650
Why just the other day I caught
him lapping out of the toilet.

46:43.651 --> 46:45.666
Down on his hands and knees.

46:45.667 --> 46:48.069
Ugh, like some kind of fucking,
bowser.

46:51.866 --> 46:55.290
I may kill him.

46:55.291 --> 46:57.729
I don't know if I feel a damned
thing about him.

46:57.730 --> 47:00.733
But uh, you?

47:01.790 --> 47:04.725
I sure do love ya son.

47:04.726 --> 47:08.730
Now Charlie you take that
possible hooker out to that
barn, and you fuck her like an
animal!

47:09.673 --> 47:10.989
Can we have sex now?

47:10.990 --> 47:11.767
Yes!

47:11.768 --> 47:13.146
All right!

47:13.147 --> 47:14.396
(Applause)

47:14.397 --> 47:15.050
(Baby splat)

47:15.051 --> 47:16.523
Bye mama!

47:16.524 --> 47:19.307
You sit your queer ass down!

47:19.308 --> 47:21.610
All right Charlie!

47:23.451 --> 47:27.098
Oh, now that is a fine cut of
puss!

47:27.099 --> 47:29.602
(Heavy metal music begins)

47:35.115 --> 47:37.786
Uh, I'm so hungry!

47:37.787 --> 47:39.641
When will we feast?

47:39.642 --> 47:41.770
The time is nigh my friend.

47:41.771 --> 47:43.933
Try and savor the thrill of the
hunt!

47:43.934 --> 47:45.134
But?

47:45.135 --> 47:47.246
All right all right ladies and
germs.

47:47.247 --> 47:49.358
Let's hear it one more time for
Candy.

47:49.359 --> 47:52.565
You know they call her that,
because she tastes so sweet!

47:52.566 --> 47:55.213
But why can't we eat just one?

47:55.214 --> 47:58.685
Come on, you know you can't just
eat one.

47:58.686 --> 48:01.688
But, but you got to eat on
earlier!

48:02.950 --> 48:05.205
I can eat just one.

48:05.206 --> 48:06.580
Oh really?

48:06.581 --> 48:07.884
And why's that?

48:07.885 --> 48:10.796
Because I have self control.

48:10.797 --> 48:12.708
Oh really!

48:12.709 --> 48:14.688
And I don't?

48:14.689 --> 48:16.704
We both know you don't.

48:16.705 --> 48:19.568
(Grumbling noises)

48:19.569 --> 48:21.971
Hey mister, tip me for a dance?

48:23.649 --> 48:25.650
(Little begging noises)

48:30.480 --> 48:31.936
(Gasp)

48:31.937 --> 48:32.845
(Bigger angry noises)

48:32.846 --> 48:33.356
(Crunching noise)

48:33.357 --> 48:34.150
Noooo!!

48:34.151 --> 48:35.795
(Large panicked group screaming)

48:35.796 --> 48:37.313
What the Hell was that?

48:37.314 --> 48:40.317
I don't know, but it sounds like
a ball!

48:41.610 --> 48:44.009
I'll check it out.

48:44.010 --> 48:47.689
(Screaming)

48:47.690 --> 48:51.177
(Disgusting eating sounds)

48:51.178 --> 48:55.182
She was the only clean stripper
in this joint!

48:55.481 --> 48:58.229
(Crying)

48:58.230 --> 49:00.972
(Crunching and swallowing
noises)

49:00.973 --> 49:02.975
Uhhh...

49:04.933 --> 49:06.148
Scrotes!

49:06.149 --> 49:07.476
(Kicking sound effect)

49:07.477 --> 49:08.708
It's go time.

49:08.709 --> 49:12.713
I sure hope Carrieola's having
better luck than we are.

49:13.581 --> 49:16.220
Look, I'm really sorry about all
that.

49:16.221 --> 49:18.204
I'm old fashioned.

49:18.205 --> 49:22.209
And it's important for me, that
my family gets to meet, the
girl that I'm going to-

49:23.240 --> 49:24.862
Have sex with?

49:24.863 --> 49:26.070
Yeah.

49:26.071 --> 49:30.075
Also someone that I feel like I
really have a connection with.

49:31.715 --> 49:34.217
I just wish they weren't so dang
rude!

49:36.418 --> 49:40.409
It'd be nice if my girl and my
family could get along.

49:40.410 --> 49:42.842
I thought they were wonderful
Charlie.

49:42.843 --> 49:45.585
Come on, you're just being silly
now.

49:45.586 --> 49:48.457
No, I mean it.

49:48.458 --> 49:51.161
I mean, your mom's a little
weird.

49:53.114 --> 49:55.617
And you're dad's not the nicest.

49:57.314 --> 49:58.689
No.

49:58.690 --> 50:01.738
But, they still raised you.

50:01.739 --> 50:04.485
And I think you turned out
pretty okay.

50:04.486 --> 50:07.189
Yeah, I guess I am pretty okay
aren't I?

50:08.765 --> 50:11.768
(Sexy saxaphone music begins)

50:50.459 --> 50:51.514
(Horse neighs)

50:51.515 --> 50:53.366
(Horse neighs)

50:58.442 --> 51:01.245
Are you ready?

51:02.722 --> 51:04.114
I think so.

51:04.115 --> 51:05.873
Device has been set to
extraction mode.

51:05.874 --> 51:08.897
But, are you ready?

51:08.898 --> 51:11.651
Yes Charlie, I'm ready.

51:14.130 --> 51:15.242
(Zipper sound effect)

51:15.243 --> 51:17.245
(Boing!)

51:20.245 --> 51:24.044
Oh Carrieola.

51:24.045 --> 51:26.180
Charlie?

51:26.181 --> 51:28.403
Carrieola.

51:28.404 --> 51:29.827
Charlie.

51:29.828 --> 51:31.372
Carrieola.

51:31.373 --> 51:32.332
Charlie!

51:32.333 --> 51:33.147
(Record scratches)

51:33.148 --> 51:34.899
What?

51:34.900 --> 51:38.123
I know you're the one trying to
show me something here.

51:38.124 --> 51:42.023
But I think we'd have a lot
better luck if you were in my
vagina.

51:42.024 --> 51:45.359
Instead of my belly button.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.862
Oh!

51:47.253 --> 51:48.306
(Uncorcking sound effect)

51:48.307 --> 51:49.808
Sorry.

51:51.847 --> 51:54.038
(Plunger sound effect)

51:54.039 --> 51:55.630
There it is.

51:55.631 --> 51:57.813
(Sexy saxaphone music resumes)

51:57.814 --> 52:00.317
Oh, Carrieola!

52:03.174 --> 52:05.621
Oh Charlie.

52:05.622 --> 52:07.557
(Techno music begins)

52:07.558 --> 52:09.637
(Girl screaming)

52:09.638 --> 52:12.604
(Animalistic lusting sounds)

52:12.605 --> 52:15.308
(Crowd screaming)

52:19.533 --> 52:22.480
(Dog barking)

52:22.481 --> 52:25.284
(Crowd screaming)

52:27.354 --> 52:29.576
(Spanish guitar begins)

52:29.577 --> 52:31.248
Look's like there's only two of
them.

52:31.249 --> 52:32.415
For now.

52:32.416 --> 52:34.776
Come on, I got an idea.

52:34.777 --> 52:37.579
(Crowd screaming)

52:39.752 --> 52:41.208
Come on up here babes.

52:41.209 --> 52:45.213
These things feed off of visual
stimulation, but they don't know
when to quit!

52:46.040 --> 52:48.343
(Lustful growling sounds)

52:52.216 --> 52:54.719
(Anxious begging sounds)

52:56.680 --> 53:00.426
The only way to defeat them is
to give them what they want
until they can't take it
anymore!

53:00.427 --> 53:02.930
(Spanish guitar grows in
intensity)

53:10.787 --> 53:12.058
Charlie?

53:12.059 --> 53:13.730
What?

53:13.731 --> 53:17.522
Do you mind if I give it a try?

53:17.523 --> 53:19.024
Sure.

53:23.827 --> 53:26.329
(Spanish guitar continues
building)

53:33.686 --> 53:34.885
Better?

53:34.886 --> 53:37.350
Yes Charlie Yes!

53:37.351 --> 53:38.989
All Right!

53:38.990 --> 53:41.493
Yes! Yes! Yes!

53:43.470 --> 53:45.972
(Spanish guitar builds even
more)

53:48.086 --> 53:51.885
(Longing, wanting sounds)

53:51.886 --> 53:53.077
Yes, that's it!

53:53.078 --> 53:55.213
Keep shaking those tits babes!

53:55.214 --> 53:57.716
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:01.421 --> 54:02.992
It's working Charlie!

54:02.993 --> 54:06.240
(Longing, lustful mumbling)

54:06.241 --> 54:09.352
(Spanish guitar continues to
build)

54:09.353 --> 54:09.854
(Unintelligible lust filled
gibberish)

54:20.217 --> 54:20.717
(Electric guitar begins to take
over)

54:24.337 --> 54:26.839
Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:28.366 --> 54:29.867
(Slap)

54:31.584 --> 54:33.375
It's working Charlie!

54:33.376 --> 54:35.678
Just keep sexing me!

54:39.036 --> 54:41.538
(Electric guitar builds)

54:44.884 --> 54:47.386
Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:49.483 --> 54:51.986
Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:51.987 --> 54:54.442
Oh my God.

54:54.443 --> 54:56.394
(Lust filled insanity)

54:56.395 --> 54:57.355
Carrieola!

54:57.356 --> 55:00.358
I'm going to.

55:01.283 --> 55:03.166
Yes! Yes! Yes!

55:03.167 --> 55:05.645
(Grunting sounds)

55:05.646 --> 55:07.397
Look out!

55:07.398 --> 55:08.799
(Grunting and gushing)

55:08.800 --> 55:11.202
(Satisfied cooing noises)

55:23.723 --> 55:25.458
Oh man.

55:25.459 --> 55:27.682
They jizzed themselves to death.

55:27.683 --> 55:30.122
(Crowd cheering)

55:30.123 --> 55:32.625
(Synth music begins)

55:46.132 --> 55:48.012
All right!

55:48.013 --> 55:50.603
Get your asses to the bar,
drink's are on me!

55:50.604 --> 55:53.106
(Crowd cheering)

56:04.232 --> 56:06.391
Oh my Zob.

56:06.392 --> 56:08.994
No babe, just Charlie.

56:10.780 --> 56:13.091
I'm sorry Charlie.

56:13.092 --> 56:15.315
Sorry for what?

56:15.316 --> 56:18.069
I mean, I just-

56:19.628 --> 56:23.631
I know you tried to tell me how
it was going to be, but that was
amazing.

56:25.810 --> 56:28.613
Yeah, that was pretty amazing
wasn't it?

56:30.507 --> 56:33.841
I had no idea we would make that
much energy.

56:33.842 --> 56:37.778
Come on I mean, yeah it was
amazing, but-

56:37.779 --> 56:39.762
When can we do it again Charlie?

56:39.763 --> 56:42.806
Now hang on a dog gone minute.

56:42.807 --> 56:44.501
I wonder how the others are
doing?

56:44.502 --> 56:46.581
I wonder if they've discovered
this?

56:46.582 --> 56:48.318
Surely not on their own.

56:48.319 --> 56:52.323
There's a whole hell of a lot
more than just sexual energy
going on right now.

56:52.822 --> 56:54.749
I've got to get back to them.

56:54.750 --> 56:56.254
Just listen to me for a second.

56:56.255 --> 56:57.925
Charlie I've got to do this to
more men.

56:57.926 --> 56:59.444
You've got to take me to do this
to more men.

56:59.445 --> 57:01.085
Carrie?

57:01.086 --> 57:03.589
Didn't you feel anything?

57:05.894 --> 57:08.221
Of course I did Charlie.

57:08.222 --> 57:10.837
What we did in this barn was
amazing.

57:10.838 --> 57:14.217
I've never experienced anything
like it.

57:14.218 --> 57:18.222
I felt a connection between us
that I've never felt with anyone
my whole life.

57:19.393 --> 57:21.880
But feeling's won't get me and
my Babe's back home.

57:21.881 --> 57:24.000
And we've got to get back home.

57:24.001 --> 57:28.005
And to do that I've got to get
back to that strip club and sex
as many men as I can.

57:28.201 --> 57:32.205
This energy, it's on a whole
other level.

57:33.153 --> 57:35.976
I've never felt anything like
it.

57:35.977 --> 57:38.980
It's strong.

57:39.857 --> 57:42.767
Stronger than a grizzly bear.

57:42.768 --> 57:44.270
Yeah.

57:47.148 --> 57:49.794
(Synth pop music)

57:49.795 --> 57:51.131
Well you Babe's are all right in
my book.

57:51.132 --> 57:52.299
Hell yeah you are.

57:52.300 --> 57:55.754
I don't know where you Babe's
learned that, but you sure
taught us a thing or two about
titty bouncing.

57:55.755 --> 57:57.883
Where you two from anyway?

57:57.884 --> 58:00.155
We're not from here.

58:00.156 --> 58:01.867
Well Hell yeah!

58:01.868 --> 58:03.402
Carrieola!

58:03.403 --> 58:06.299
Oh hey Babe, you sure missed a
party here.

58:06.300 --> 58:07.777
Carrieola!

58:07.778 --> 58:09.498
Would you like to sex me?

58:09.499 --> 58:13.025
Well hell yeah!

58:13.026 --> 58:16.029
(Synth pop music)

58:30.438 --> 58:33.441
Women. They sure are pretty to
look at.

58:34.765 --> 58:38.333
But you ain't never gonna make
them understand you.

58:38.334 --> 58:41.116
And you ain't ever gonna
understand them.

58:41.117 --> 58:44.324
Yeah, you're telling me pal.

58:44.325 --> 58:48.329
Listen, the sooner you come to
terms with the fact that they're
not even the same species as us?

58:49.597 --> 58:51.420
The sooner you're gonna be
happy.

58:51.421 --> 58:54.408
I think I'm coming to terms with
that.

58:54.409 --> 58:56.897
Look you're not listening to me
bud.

58:56.898 --> 59:00.097
Stop over thinking it. Just face
the music.

59:00.098 --> 59:02.511
I don't know this chick you're
hung up on.

59:02.512 --> 59:06.352
And it doesn't matter. Because
they're all the same.

59:06.353 --> 59:08.703
Just like we're all the same.

59:08.704 --> 59:12.708
It isn't a bad thing, it just is
what it is.

59:13.041 --> 59:16.312
Women, they don't think about
shit the way we do.

59:16.313 --> 59:20.317
And we don't think about shit
the way they do.

59:20.865 --> 59:22.783
You two are gonna be okay.

59:22.784 --> 59:23.838
Just remember-

59:23.839 --> 59:27.519
You're a man, and she's a woman.

59:27.520 --> 59:31.356
You're not even from the same
planet.

59:31.357 --> 59:34.699
You know what? You're right!

59:34.700 --> 59:36.115
Sure am bud.

59:36.116 --> 59:39.434
It doesn't matter what I say or
do.

59:39.435 --> 59:43.114
She's gonna come to her own
conclusion on her own time!

59:43.115 --> 59:45.402
Preach it brother.

59:45.403 --> 59:47.602
I'm gonna get her.

59:47.603 --> 59:51.607
And I'm gonna tell her that it's
okay she doesn't understand.

59:51.651 --> 59:52.890
Church!

59:52.891 --> 59:56.658
And that's okay, because I don't
even understand.

59:56.659 --> 59:58.074
Hallelujah!

59:58.075 --> 01:00:02.079
And if it takes us the rest of
our dag burned lives to figure
it out.

01:00:02.919 --> 01:00:06.637
Well, we're gonna figure it out
together!

01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:09.692
Lord have mercy!

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:12.196
(Laughter)

01:00:13.983 --> 01:00:15.988
God damn.

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:18.389
(Country western music begins)

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:19.350
Charlie!

01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:20.397
Not now darlin'.

01:00:20.398 --> 01:00:21.620
Oh Charlie!

01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:24.223
Take a seat sweety.

01:00:27.421 --> 01:00:28.530
(Yelp!)

01:00:28.531 --> 01:00:29.752
We'd like you to accept this
flower-

01:00:29.753 --> 01:00:30.277
(Punch)

01:00:30.278 --> 01:00:31.503
No thank's pal!

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:34.434
(Groan)

01:00:34.435 --> 01:00:37.176
Get a room ladies!

01:00:37.177 --> 01:00:39.887
Carrieola, I need you to listen
to me!

01:00:39.888 --> 01:00:42.567
Now I know you might not
understand.

01:00:42.568 --> 01:00:46.572
And that's okay, because I don't
even understand.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.804
But what happened between us
back in the barn, that was
something special.

01:00:51.256 --> 01:00:54.263
You said it yourself, you felt a
connection.

01:00:54.264 --> 01:00:58.268
And that connection is something
we people down here spend our
entire lives looking for.

01:01:00.379 --> 01:01:04.383
And if you're lucky enough to
find that one person in this
world, or any other world-

01:01:06.475 --> 01:01:09.482
Well, you can't just ignore
that!

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:11.770
Now whoever you're in there
with-

01:01:11.771 --> 01:01:13.050
It's Jake!

01:01:13.051 --> 01:01:15.178
Okay, Jake.

01:01:15.179 --> 01:01:19.170
Now I'm sure you're showing Jake
a really great time.

01:01:19.171 --> 01:01:20.898
And Jethro!

01:01:20.899 --> 01:01:23.210
And Jethro?

01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:27.215
But, the connection you felt,
between me and you.

01:01:27.947 --> 01:01:31.186
Well you're not gonna get that
with Jake and Jethro.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.509
And Carl.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:33.925
and Carl.

01:01:33.926 --> 01:01:35.230
I think I saw Jimmy in here too!

01:01:35.231 --> 01:01:38.373
Yeah that was me Bobby, sorry
about grabbing your ass earlier.

01:01:38.374 --> 01:01:40.733
Come on! Enough's enough.

01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:42.293
I'm coming in there.

01:01:42.294 --> 01:01:44.797
(Dramatic horror music begins)

01:01:46.397 --> 01:01:48.556
(Baby rattles rattling)

01:01:48.557 --> 01:01:50.659
(Pacifier sucking sounds)

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:55.460
(Horror music continues)

01:02:03.733 --> 01:02:06.016
That's a good boy!

01:02:06.017 --> 01:02:08.519
(Groaning)

01:02:10.488 --> 01:02:13.191
Oh my God, I'm gonna throw up!

01:02:14.584 --> 01:02:17.200
(Faint synth music playing)

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:19.583
(Toilet flushes)

01:02:19.584 --> 01:02:21.586
There.

01:02:23.576 --> 01:02:26.078
(Vomit noises)

01:02:30.104 --> 01:02:32.106
(Coughing)

01:02:39.707 --> 01:02:43.711
You haven't seen a girl that I
was in here earlier with have
you?

01:02:44.955 --> 01:02:46.773
Blonde?

01:02:48.427 --> 01:02:52.431
Yeah I uh, saw her with some
drunk guy in the pool room.

01:02:53.183 --> 01:02:55.185
Thanks.

01:02:58.366 --> 01:03:00.969
You mind if I use that sink real
quick?

01:03:04.005 --> 01:03:06.307
Go ahead.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.042
(Sink turns on, water flowing)

01:03:28.999 --> 01:03:31.501
(Synth music continues)

01:03:56.314 --> 01:03:58.716
I just don't understand it
Charlie.

01:04:00.897 --> 01:04:03.700
Everything felt so right with
you.

01:04:05.185 --> 01:04:09.189
And then I get back here, and
it's totally different.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:15.573
He had a boner! The energy was
there.

01:04:18.484 --> 01:04:22.391
But I just couldn't.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:24.694
I didn't even want to.

01:04:26.426 --> 01:04:30.430
All I could think about was you,
and how it was with you.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:37.875
I tried to close my eyes and
pretend he was you.

01:04:38.993 --> 01:04:41.105
But even that didn't work.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.963
And I felt like I was gonna get
sick.

01:04:49.257 --> 01:04:53.261
But then in a second, everything
changed.

01:04:57.008 --> 01:04:59.374
And I was back in that barn.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.377
With you.

01:05:02.604 --> 01:05:04.706
And then my stomach felt really
wierd.

01:05:06.884 --> 01:05:10.750
But not sick like before.

01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:14.590
It was, it was like.

01:05:14.591 --> 01:05:17.394
It was, it was like-

01:05:18.735 --> 01:05:22.739
Like a whole herd of butterflies
was just let loose?

01:05:24.159 --> 01:05:26.078
Yeah.

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:28.630
It's time to get out of here
Carrieola.

01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:30.621
The good news is we have enough
energy to get back home.

01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:32.886
The bad news is, there's more
scrotes on the way.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:36.891
We have to hit the road before
they get down here and cause
anymore trouble.

01:05:38.658 --> 01:05:40.660
Take us home Charlie.

01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:45.937
They're not really gonna leave
him, are they?

01:05:45.938 --> 01:05:48.737
Well what do you think's gonna
happen?

01:05:48.738 --> 01:05:51.352
Their Space Babes Charlie,
they're not from here.

01:05:51.353 --> 01:05:54.097
She can't just leave him, she
can't!

01:05:54.098 --> 01:05:58.102
Calm down now, one thing fairy
tales all have in common, adult
or not-

01:05:58.593 --> 01:06:01.017
Is a happy ending.

01:06:01.018 --> 01:06:03.472
Now you gonna let me finish this
story or not?

01:06:03.473 --> 01:06:06.241
Okay, let's finish the story.

01:06:06.242 --> 01:06:08.297
Okay now where were we?

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.632
Oh yeah right.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:13.637
Charlie and the Babes left the
titty bar, and were on their way
back to the barn.

01:06:14.765 --> 01:06:17.467
(Emotional music begins)

01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:39.075
So I guess this is goodbye huh?

01:06:39.076 --> 01:06:43.055
Yeah, I guess it is.

01:06:43.056 --> 01:06:45.875
You do know she's gonna want to
take him back with us, right?

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:47.970
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's
not going to want to leave his
home.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.750
(Computer sounds)

01:06:50.751 --> 01:06:53.121
What if she wants to stay here?

01:06:53.122 --> 01:06:56.704
Come on, you can't be serious.

01:06:56.705 --> 01:06:59.697
(Computer noises)

01:06:59.698 --> 01:07:03.702
Go get her communicator, we're
going to need to upload her
energy too.

01:07:10.949 --> 01:07:13.972
Charlie I don't know what to do.

01:07:13.973 --> 01:07:17.491
Do what your heart tells you.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.044
I'm trying.

01:07:19.045 --> 01:07:20.811
You about ready to get off this
rock?

01:07:20.812 --> 01:07:22.499
Yeah, just give me a minute.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.171
Give me your communicator and I
will.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.795
We need to upload your energy
onto the ship.

01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:27.451
But you won't have much more
than a minute.

01:07:27.452 --> 01:07:31.455
She's fueling up and we're
taking off in five.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.979
Do you remember the first thing
you said to me?

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.634
When you first saw me?

01:07:37.635 --> 01:07:40.650
When I first saw you.

01:07:40.651 --> 01:07:43.602
You said stay.

01:07:43.603 --> 01:07:47.607
Please Carrie, don't let that be
the last thing I say to you.

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.001
I can't.

01:07:55.983 --> 01:07:59.614
Look, either we're both staying,
or we're both leaving.

01:07:59.615 --> 01:08:03.142
We can try to talk and decide
which one it is.

01:08:03.143 --> 01:08:06.934
But it doesn't matter, because I
love you.

01:08:06.935 --> 01:08:09.537
Do you love me?

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.814
I, I think I do.

01:08:15.815 --> 01:08:18.457
Carrie, that makes us in love.

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:21.033
And you remember what my daddy
told me about being in love.

01:08:21.033 --> 01:08:22.209
Charlie look out!

01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:25.017
No, I'm pretty sure I told you
back at the bar, he said-

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.591
(Growling)

01:08:27.593 --> 01:08:28.961
Carrie!

01:08:28.962 --> 01:08:30.551
(Dramatic music begins)

01:08:30.553 --> 01:08:32.081
I'm gonna give you the shaft!

01:08:32.082 --> 01:08:33.560
Noooooooo!

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.564
(Eating sounds)

01:08:39.064 --> 01:08:40.895
You've overstayed your welcome
bean bag!

01:08:40.897 --> 01:08:41.469
Computer!

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:42.479
(Computer noise)

01:08:42.481 --> 01:08:44.515
Blast this nut sack to
smithereens!

01:08:44.515 --> 01:08:48.880
I'd love to do that Babes, but
this nut sack has overridden my
system, and has control over all
of my circuitry.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:53.139
The whole situation is quite
Shit.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.778
(Laughter)

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:58.299
You Space Babes never did know
how to keep your pie holes shut!

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.993
Quick, let's get out of here!

01:08:59.995 --> 01:09:00.993
(Laughter)

01:09:00.995 --> 01:09:02.107
Computer!

01:09:02.108 --> 01:09:04.801
Open up energy release valve!

01:09:04.803 --> 01:09:08.807
(Large energy release noises
with thunder and power)

01:09:10.002 --> 01:09:11.490
Sorry Babes.

01:09:11.491 --> 01:09:13.877
You Salzarion son of a
skankazoid!

01:09:13.879 --> 01:09:15.810
And now that I know you won't be
running away.

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:19.189
I'm gonna take my time and savor
you!

01:09:19.191 --> 01:09:21.046
(Laughter)

01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:23.917
(The sound of alien indigestion)

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.054
(Burp)

01:09:25.055 --> 01:09:28.158
Oh man, I think I got a rumbly
in my tumbly!

01:09:28.158 --> 01:09:30.310
(Farting noise)

01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:33.636
Oh man, I think I need to lay
down!

01:09:33.638 --> 01:09:36.085
I don't feel so good!

01:09:36.086 --> 01:09:38.237
Oh is this the way I end?

01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:39.629
(Groaning in pain)

01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:41.452
I'm coming to see you Elizabeth!

01:09:41.453 --> 01:09:43.133
Oh my goodness.

01:09:43.134 --> 01:09:46.881
Hang on Babes, this ain't over
yet!

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.616
(Moaning and groaning in pain)

01:09:49.617 --> 01:09:51.528
Why oh Why! Oh it's the big one!

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:54.568
You just gotta stay down!

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:58.573
No matter how hard you fight me,
in the end you're still just a
Weak!

01:09:58.993 --> 01:09:59.832
Little!

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:00.976
Girl!

01:10:00.977 --> 01:10:02.872
(Flesh ripping sound)

01:10:02.873 --> 01:10:05.876
(Dramatic hero music begins)

01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.104
Oh man, I new it!

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.415
Check it out!

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:13.495
Don't!

01:10:13.496 --> 01:10:14.623
Call!

01:10:14.624 --> 01:10:15.719
Me!

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.567
Girl!

01:10:17.568 --> 01:10:19.439
(Spit)

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.475
(Heavy breathing)

01:10:21.476 --> 01:10:24.078
I'm a Space Babe.

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:37.370
Why the Hell did you push me out
of the way, you could have been
killed.

01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:38.490
I thought you were dead.

01:10:38.491 --> 01:10:40.818
I thought we were all dead.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:42.267
Are you okay?

01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:44.570
I'm fine Charlie, really I'm
fine.

01:10:46.651 --> 01:10:50.026
I guess we really are in love.

01:10:50.027 --> 01:10:53.718
Yeah, I guess we are.

01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:57.723
Just me and you, against the
whole universe.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.230
Ain't nothin' gonna keep us
apart.

01:11:01.231 --> 01:11:03.246
Not even death.

01:11:03.247 --> 01:11:06.021
(Sexy saxaphone music)

01:11:06.022 --> 01:11:07.717
I hate to break up this
emotional moment,

01:11:07.718 --> 01:11:11.722
but that sad sack did release
all of our energy into the
atmosphere before you ripped him
inside out.

01:11:12.742 --> 01:11:16.469
I do not want to be stuck on
this rock another minute.

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:17.965
What are we going to do?

01:11:17.966 --> 01:11:20.741
Well I don't think we have much
of a choice.

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:22.580
We'll pack it in for tonight and
get some rest,

01:11:22.581 --> 01:11:25.853
and then tomorrow we'll go back
to the strip club and start all
over again.

01:11:25.854 --> 01:11:27.388
Oh my Zob.

01:11:27.389 --> 01:11:29.404
I don't think I can go back to
that place.

01:11:29.405 --> 01:11:32.544
It smells like cotton candy and
shame.

01:11:32.545 --> 01:11:34.032
Look I don't want to either.

01:11:34.033 --> 01:11:35.712
but I don't know what else we
can do.

01:11:35.713 --> 01:11:39.048
We need sexual energy, and a lot
of it.

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:41.852
Does anybody else have any
bright ideas?

01:11:49.321 --> 01:11:51.415
I think we've got an idea.

01:11:51.416 --> 01:11:52.559
(sheep sounds)

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.063
(Groovy rock song begins)

01:13:36.573 --> 01:13:37.916
Computer!

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:39.724
Prepare for launch.

01:13:39.725 --> 01:13:43.476
Alert the folk's back at T.C.
that we're bringing one back
with us.

01:13:43.477 --> 01:13:46.532
Take us home!

01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:50.536
Her majesty has given the go
ahead on our re-entry into the
Salzarion system.

01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:54.635
And the Titty city welcoming
committee is on standby.

01:13:54.636 --> 01:13:56.972
Prepare for landing in five-

01:13:56.973 --> 01:13:58.244
Four.

01:13:58.245 --> 01:13:59.763
Three.

01:13:59.764 --> 01:14:01.228
Two.

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:02.730
One.

01:14:03.716 --> 01:14:05.187
Gloss up Babes.

01:14:05.188 --> 01:14:08.119
I have a feeling there's going
to be welcoming party waiting
for us.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.124
They're going to get a real kick
out of you.

01:14:16.264 --> 01:14:17.759
(Beep)

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.761
(Woosh!)

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.454
Charlie, welcome to Titty City!

01:14:24.455 --> 01:14:26.957
(Groovy rock song grows in
volume)

01:14:38.027 --> 01:14:40.626
(Groovy rock song ends)

01:14:40.627 --> 01:14:42.098
That's it?

01:14:42.099 --> 01:14:43.457
That's it.

01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:44.902
You're kidding me.

01:14:44.903 --> 01:14:47.637
You're not going to tell me what
Titty City looks like?

01:14:47.638 --> 01:14:51.642
Well, I mean, I don't think
you're reay for that quite yet.

01:14:52.095 --> 01:14:54.230
What a crock of shit!

01:14:54.231 --> 01:14:58.234
Hey now, I'm the boss here, and
I'm not sure if you're ready for
that part of the story just yet.

01:14:58.974 --> 01:15:01.077
I feel ready.

01:15:01.078 --> 01:15:03.557
Well, maybe another time
Charlie.

01:15:03.558 --> 01:15:06.360
I've kept you up long enough.

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:15.745
And besides, some things are
better left to the imagination.

01:15:15.885 --> 01:15:18.188
Sweet dreams.

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:24.042
(Windchimes)

01:15:35.432 --> 01:15:37.935
(Dreamy soft music)

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:45.186
(Angelic voices singing)

01:15:52.944 --> 01:15:55.697
(Wind Chimes)
