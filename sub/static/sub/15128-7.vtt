00:08.045 --> 00:09.714
You shot him, Mr. Reid,

00:09.714 --> 00:11.260
in defence.

00:12.736 --> 00:14.469
The, uh, bearer bonds...

00:14.471 --> 00:16.305
- What of them?
- Where are they?

00:16.306 --> 00:18.574
'Tis, um... a mystery.

00:18.576 --> 00:20.008
Why are you bringing this to me?

00:20.010 --> 00:22.777
Have you really forgot what
the name Theodore Patrick Swift,

00:22.777 --> 00:24.270
your father-in-law, means?

00:24.270 --> 00:27.331
You think, what, Susan
was involved in this?

00:28.219 --> 00:30.372
Does this buy back a life?

00:30.496 --> 00:31.696
I fear for us.

00:31.702 --> 00:33.889
I fear we shall lose each other again.

00:33.891 --> 00:35.546
You saved me.

00:37.094 --> 00:39.461
You're not supposed to
start until tomorrow.

00:39.713 --> 00:41.563
I want to know if I can see it,

00:41.565 --> 00:44.094
see the evil that has come to roost in you.

01:29.458 --> 01:33.048
Well? Do you have it?

01:41.321 --> 01:44.104
It has made me grievous ill, sir.

01:44.481 --> 01:47.282
That is only to be expected.

01:59.763 --> 02:01.688
Mm.

03:48.817 --> 03:51.240
What awful poison has he given ya?

03:51.241 --> 03:53.947
I beg you, no more of this.

03:53.954 --> 03:55.887
You must to work.

03:57.124 --> 04:00.192
I can't. I won't leave you.

04:00.193 --> 04:02.393
We must carry on as always.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.175
You go to work, as always.

04:05.643 --> 04:09.100
You have your tea, and your smoke,

04:09.614 --> 04:12.323
and you play a hand, as always.

04:12.324 --> 04:14.391
Still you will not tell me?

04:14.591 --> 04:16.750
What bastard had his way with ya?

04:17.122 --> 04:18.808
I will not.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.259
For your own sake, I will not.

04:22.925 --> 04:25.026
There is too much to lose.

04:25.099 --> 04:29.606
_

04:29.786 --> 04:32.166
Mr. Havelock! Tait's arrived!

04:32.272 --> 04:36.306
Oi. Oi! What the bloody
hell time you call this, eh?

04:36.678 --> 04:39.025
You clock off Saturday,
half the afternoon gone,

04:39.025 --> 04:40.250
now you come in an hour late.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.309
And I've got the governor
in asking why we're behind.

04:42.310 --> 04:43.510
Mary's been ill.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.153
I didn't like to leave her.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.766
You will make up that time.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.532
Mary! Mary!

05:01.259 --> 05:02.459
No.

05:02.856 --> 05:05.207
No. No. No, you must away.

05:05.207 --> 05:07.436
He must not find you here. He told you! No!

05:07.624 --> 05:10.000
He told you, no.

05:12.452 --> 05:14.420
But I went against him,

05:15.513 --> 05:20.132
after all he's given me. So much care.

05:20.616 --> 05:23.652
And I have brought all
this trouble to his door.

05:26.234 --> 05:28.932
If he should be discovered,
the fault is mine.

05:28.933 --> 05:30.431
Discovered? Discovered how?

05:30.431 --> 05:31.857
You must away.

05:32.145 --> 05:33.700
There must be no more grief,

05:33.701 --> 05:36.376
- lest he be found out.
- I don't understand. What do you mean?

05:36.376 --> 05:41.236
And so I will have ended
it all, all he has built,

05:41.237 --> 05:44.056
This happiness found at last.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.040
A Mr. Currie, chemist...

07:00.455 --> 07:03.605
no longer available to dispense medicine.

07:22.159 --> 07:25.558
It is too soon. You have
not yet recovered, sir.

07:25.991 --> 07:29.348
I am not yet in need
of a chair, nor a nurse.

07:29.493 --> 07:32.334
Oh, indeed? You are perfectly well?

07:32.335 --> 07:34.367
A man lately shot in the head... of course.

07:34.494 --> 07:37.930
Why on earth you've come back to
this rough old game, I do not know.

07:39.586 --> 07:42.744
You have made your point, Bennet.

07:45.213 --> 07:47.511
Then let us get back to this game.

07:49.368 --> 07:53.078
I will not ask why it is in your
pocket and not yet on her finger.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.744
How?

07:59.368 --> 08:00.568
This, then?

08:04.842 --> 08:06.056
A robbery?

08:06.245 --> 08:07.982
But what's there to rob here?

08:17.530 --> 08:20.064
What chemist leaves a bottle unmarked?

08:23.476 --> 08:26.076
One who is sure of its contents.

08:30.891 --> 08:32.539
This is the last.

08:33.109 --> 08:35.009
Pushed deep, hard,

08:35.441 --> 08:38.774
with fingers... jammed in with... forced.

08:39.682 --> 08:43.405
Made to eat his own money,
then... to choke upon it.

08:43.447 --> 08:45.484
No, that's not what killed him.

08:45.515 --> 08:47.534
One blow to the head
did that for him first.

08:47.534 --> 08:50.034
Heavy weapon, crude, but effective.

08:50.035 --> 08:54.207
And this man is killed, yet the
rage unrelieved must be satisfied...

08:54.208 --> 08:59.131
some... outrage still to be expressed,
some disgust pertaining to money.

09:00.484 --> 09:02.584
This... have you determined its contents?

09:02.586 --> 09:04.490
Pretty potion it is.

09:04.788 --> 09:06.922
Pennyroyal, Spanish fly.

09:06.924 --> 09:08.409
Brings on miscarriage.

09:08.755 --> 09:11.626
So our man here was an abortionist.

09:11.729 --> 09:14.129
But these are home remedies,

09:14.131 --> 09:15.917
two a penny... nothing to kill for.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.239
This is where it gets strange.

09:17.239 --> 09:20.740
This compound of Currie's...
heavy presence of lead.

09:20.873 --> 09:24.139
Brings on damage to the brain,
nerves, abdominal trauma.

09:24.141 --> 09:25.941
This poisoning could be fatal?

09:25.943 --> 09:28.102
Worst case, coma and death.

09:28.545 --> 09:31.697
So, some boy got his girl in trouble,

09:31.697 --> 09:34.516
they saw an end to it,
she got poisoned violently,

09:34.518 --> 09:36.485
mortally even, by this chemist,

09:36.487 --> 09:39.621
who, insult to injury, charged them for it.

09:39.623 --> 09:41.477
And so he kills the callous son of a bitch,

09:41.477 --> 09:44.184
takes those notes, every one he
paid, and rams them down his throat.

09:44.185 --> 09:46.140
We must find this girl,
whatsoever her fate.

09:46.140 --> 09:47.540
With her, her lad.

09:47.755 --> 09:51.359
The chemist's book, sir.
There's an apprentice was paid.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.538
He will have gone to ground. You find him.

09:53.538 --> 09:55.996
Drake, check the morgues
for any more victims.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.495
I shall go to the Obsidian Clinic.

09:57.495 --> 10:00.228
If she has survived, no doubt
she would have ended up there.

10:06.298 --> 10:09.478
I am here as policeman, not patient.

10:09.585 --> 10:13.617
You are a patient yet, and should
not be a policeman for some while.

10:13.935 --> 10:15.430
You are sleeping?

10:16.681 --> 10:17.881
No.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.285
Double vision?

10:26.308 --> 10:28.145
- Headaches?
- No.

10:28.257 --> 10:30.652
Yes. Yes, on occasion.

10:30.652 --> 10:33.373
Um, we seek the murderer of a chemist.

10:34.997 --> 10:37.831
Are they severe, the headaches?

10:39.524 --> 10:41.700
Some, one or two, yes.

10:42.238 --> 10:45.713
Uh, this chemist we believe
a practitioner of abortion,

10:45.713 --> 10:48.704
And you, I imagine, would have
cause to treat such a man's clients.

10:48.704 --> 10:50.603
Push against me.

10:57.211 --> 10:58.610
You grow stronger.

10:58.612 --> 11:01.813
Then may I be a policeman for a moment?

11:03.281 --> 11:06.729
No. I do not treat them.

11:07.304 --> 11:09.003
I repair them.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.557
I patch them up.

11:14.277 --> 11:18.880
I apply a piecemeal dressing
to an ever-growing wound,

11:19.302 --> 11:22.874
And the wound itself never heals.

11:25.609 --> 11:31.211
These women, these unhappy
creatures, they come to me for help,

11:31.451 --> 11:33.288
This is their word for it.

11:33.801 --> 11:36.182
And like any doctor in this city,

11:36.685 --> 11:40.676
I could end their troubles safely, easily.

11:41.155 --> 11:42.969
But it is illegal,

11:43.286 --> 11:48.733
So I must turn them away
to be mangled and shredded

11:48.734 --> 11:54.542
by these quacks, criminals of
the backstreets and side alleys.

11:55.664 --> 11:57.595
And then they come to me after...

11:58.268 --> 12:00.529
and I must make good the wretched work.

12:01.108 --> 12:03.353
And then they come to me again...

12:03.655 --> 12:05.302
pregnant again...

12:06.917 --> 12:09.986
and I can neither treat
them, nor teach them, for to

12:09.986 --> 12:13.789
speak of contraception is
obscene in the eyes of the law.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.413
Forgive me, Inspector,

12:16.628 --> 12:19.002
I am maddened by it.

12:21.015 --> 12:22.821
These particular women,

12:22.822 --> 12:26.002
this chemist's clients,
they were given lead.

12:27.093 --> 12:28.293
Indeed.

12:28.295 --> 12:30.927
I've had four cases of lead poisoning.

12:31.097 --> 12:34.807
I knew nothing of it, then I
read of a case in Sheffield,

12:34.808 --> 12:36.561
A spate of miscarriages,

12:36.562 --> 12:39.415
and lead found in the
water supply the cause.

12:39.485 --> 12:41.319
The women there took to using it,

12:41.610 --> 12:43.740
for lead is easy to procure.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.484
Near death, all four of my patients,

12:46.485 --> 12:49.047
all damaged beyond repair,

12:49.216 --> 12:52.199
for they also suffered physical procedures,

12:52.231 --> 12:53.561
so many times...

12:53.561 --> 12:56.788
"Procedures," by which
you mean precisely...?

12:56.950 --> 13:01.060
The use of instruments
in internal intervention.

13:01.060 --> 13:04.479
So this chemist, he uses
both instrument and powder?

13:04.479 --> 13:07.412
Yes. This is something beyond.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.923
These women... these unfortunates.
I would speak to them.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.875
Would you give me their names, please?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.764
They do not tell me their true names.

13:14.764 --> 13:16.632
They come here on promise of secrecy.

13:16.632 --> 13:20.290
We ask no questions,
else they would not come,

13:20.465 --> 13:23.448
And then there would be
no hope for them at all.

13:36.578 --> 13:38.878
I come to hear your answer.

13:39.877 --> 13:41.456
My answer is yes.

13:42.095 --> 13:44.285
I knew you would not disappoint me.

13:44.285 --> 13:48.053
My favourite pupil... your
courage always delighted me.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.436
I speak only for myself.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.915
My patron, Miss Hart, must be persuaded.

13:54.022 --> 13:56.176
Then we shall discuss how.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.429
Your tough boy put you
out on the street, Rosie?

14:11.497 --> 14:14.131
What did you do, girl?

14:16.556 --> 14:17.995
Woah.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.833
I've arrived. My bag's unpacked.

14:26.012 --> 14:27.984
What is it you seek?

14:29.563 --> 14:34.070
Papers, tenements, construction agreement.

14:38.625 --> 14:39.916
You're running.

14:39.916 --> 14:42.293
This room makes me ill.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.615
I believe the contractors take advantage

14:46.615 --> 14:48.199
now Capshaw is gone.

14:48.797 --> 14:52.123
They see me defenceless
and choose their moment.

14:52.123 --> 14:54.707
They mean to take control
of the tenement expansion.

14:54.707 --> 14:56.274
But what can you do?

14:57.207 --> 15:00.589
How, stand alone against these men?

15:01.419 --> 15:04.860
I did not endure that devil
man to be brought to naught.

15:06.995 --> 15:08.747
I shall master this work.

15:09.084 --> 15:12.259
I shall make a study of
this world, its workings all.

15:13.186 --> 15:16.361
For fangs, I may have
none, but I have a mind,

15:16.362 --> 15:20.423
and it is sharper, its edge
keener, than any tooth, any blade.

15:21.117 --> 15:23.946
First, I must find the original agreement.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.294
Leave now, lest George
comes back and finds ya.

15:42.964 --> 15:44.937
If he should be discovered...

15:55.019 --> 15:57.060
What's your secret then, Tait?

16:16.432 --> 16:18.540
I am afraid, Edward.

16:18.943 --> 16:20.267
I am afraid.

16:20.470 --> 16:22.803
I don't care what you and Tait are hiding.

16:22.805 --> 16:25.754
You must have a doctor, else you will die.

16:27.114 --> 16:32.438
You are apprentice to the murdered
chemist, Currie. The abortionist, Currie.

16:32.438 --> 16:34.034
Who would have cause to kill this man?

16:34.131 --> 16:35.636
What do you know of it, boy?

16:35.636 --> 16:36.905
I don't know anything, sir.

16:36.906 --> 16:38.283
I mind the shop is all.

16:40.561 --> 16:42.445
Two in the morgue, lead poisoning,

16:42.447 --> 16:43.880
unidentified as yet.

16:43.882 --> 16:45.681
Mr. Currie, then, guilty of murder.

16:45.683 --> 16:46.883
I don't know anything, sir!

16:54.363 --> 16:58.116
Chalk dust, cut with lead for
the purposes of miscarriage.

16:58.395 --> 17:01.627
Did you... dilute these
powders, apprentice?

17:01.708 --> 17:05.259
I do, sir. But they are
useless compounds that I make.

17:05.321 --> 17:07.371
Then it will do you no
harm to taste a little.

17:08.789 --> 17:11.992
Now, boy, you will tell me what you know.

17:11.992 --> 17:13.637
I mind the shop, sir! That is all.

17:13.637 --> 17:16.416
The women would come, and Mr. Currie would
send them on. I never knew their names.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.270
Mr. Currie would send them
on for their procedures.

17:19.292 --> 17:21.665
Sent them on to who?
There were others involved?

17:22.071 --> 17:23.767
Who carried out these acts?!

17:23.767 --> 17:25.559
I don't know, sir. I was
never told such things.

17:25.559 --> 17:28.672
These men, boy, mutilated these women.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.790
They poisoned them.

17:29.791 --> 17:33.751
Some they killed, and some there may
yet be whose lives hang in the balance.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.481
Now you will tell me who these men are.

17:36.575 --> 17:38.261
One is dead, but others remain,

17:38.261 --> 17:40.939
and if one more girl dies in their care,

17:40.939 --> 17:42.104
You are to blame!

17:42.105 --> 17:44.469
I don't know, sir. I swear, I was not told.

17:44.666 --> 17:46.265
I swear, sir, on my mother's life!

17:46.365 --> 17:48.040
I cannot say what I do not know!

17:48.993 --> 17:50.193
Only the address!

17:50.194 --> 17:51.240
- Yes!
- The address!

17:51.240 --> 17:54.383
Sutherland Buildings, Number 4! Number 4!

17:59.766 --> 18:00.966
Now, then.

18:00.967 --> 18:03.761
One may cut chalk dust with anything...

18:04.841 --> 18:06.274
Sugar, even.

18:38.727 --> 18:41.528
I'd expected this backstreet
to hold a back room.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.807
This is a surgery.

18:47.936 --> 18:49.711
Interesting.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.991
Why have they blacked out the labels?

18:54.609 --> 18:57.572
Multiple visits, multiple
payments, guaranteed profit.

18:57.573 --> 18:59.925
That was my thinking. But
money has been spent here.

18:59.926 --> 19:01.258
Why? To what end?

19:01.260 --> 19:04.406
What backstreet amateur
intent on filling his purse

19:04.407 --> 19:06.053
cares to create such a place?

19:06.054 --> 19:07.962
This is no amateur concern.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.200
This is a... facility.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.284
Why use lead... crude,
violent application...

19:14.285 --> 19:15.584
when you have this?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.788
So a lot of business was done here.

19:18.765 --> 19:21.499
Business that Mr. Currie was murdered for.

19:22.958 --> 19:26.734
He might have discovered
it, threatened to expose it.

19:26.857 --> 19:29.011
Or was he a liability?

19:36.441 --> 19:38.709
And each of these women
made repeated visits.

19:38.766 --> 19:42.746
They've given their names
here. They trusted these men.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.117
And here...

19:46.184 --> 19:48.309
Their hard-spent coin.

19:50.674 --> 19:53.380
200 guineas, at least there.

19:57.469 --> 19:58.669
A strongbox.

19:59.837 --> 20:01.936
They leave their money in this bag.

20:02.931 --> 20:05.270
Begs a question, does it not?

20:06.107 --> 20:08.840
What, then, do they keep in their safe?

20:10.825 --> 20:13.611
Miss Hart, my mentor, Dr. Rolle.

20:13.611 --> 20:15.981
Madam, you are generous with your time.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.298
I'm under no illusion as
to the demand upon you.

20:18.299 --> 20:19.499
Hm.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.002
I am listening.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.204
Miss Hart,

20:24.779 --> 20:27.134
I do not mean to appear ungrateful...

20:27.160 --> 20:29.060
but I am disheartened.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.853
Gravely so.

20:31.568 --> 20:34.699
Everyday it seems, I mow
down the noxious weeds...

20:34.787 --> 20:38.672
but the roots remain, and
the plant only grows again.

20:38.692 --> 20:40.660
Speak plainly, hm?

20:41.895 --> 20:46.731
Dr. Rolle, he is a member
of the Malthusian League.

20:46.839 --> 20:48.457
I'm not aware of it.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.100
It is an organisation devoted
to the education of women

20:51.100 --> 20:53.346
in the matter of contraception.

20:53.707 --> 20:56.772
There is a clinic in Holland
where we offer such advice.

20:56.772 --> 21:00.425
The Dutch, they are much
advanced in this field.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.197
I would give my women
the information they need,

21:04.118 --> 21:05.984
but I would give them more.

21:05.986 --> 21:08.082
I would give them the help they beg for...

21:08.273 --> 21:10.273
safe procedure.

21:10.457 --> 21:13.797
You mean to offer abortion at the clinic.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.282
Absolutely not.

21:18.283 --> 21:19.582
It is illegal.

21:19.732 --> 21:21.101
The law is an ass.

21:21.102 --> 21:24.027
Recognise, of course,
that there are dangers.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.714
We believe the risk worth taking.

21:27.715 --> 21:29.881
And there we part company, sir.

21:30.084 --> 21:32.837
The demands upon me, as
you put it, are legitimate.

21:33.555 --> 21:35.901
They must be, for I am a
woman in a man's business.

21:35.901 --> 21:38.212
And there is no slack to
the rope that they allow me.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.024
Not even to hang myself.

21:40.769 --> 21:43.327
I'm sorry you have had a wasted journey.

21:43.328 --> 21:44.727
Forgive my impudence.

21:45.188 --> 21:47.722
You do not know the man you refuse.

21:47.943 --> 21:50.744
He has, from the first, encouraged me,

21:51.217 --> 21:55.124
My medical education
fraught with prejudice.

21:55.124 --> 21:58.635
He saw the talents of a
woman, and nurtured them.

21:58.764 --> 22:00.554
Well, I applaud it,

22:00.556 --> 22:02.718
but my answer remains the same.

22:04.672 --> 22:07.185
Thank you again for your
time. Good day, Miss Hart.

22:12.913 --> 22:17.384
Of course... she need never know.

22:25.839 --> 22:28.226
Jackson, this strongbox...

22:28.226 --> 22:30.744
its contents are a primary concern.

22:35.958 --> 22:40.997
Thomas Yale, single dial,
simple, elegant. Beautiful.

22:40.998 --> 22:43.288
Enough appreciation. Can you crack it?

22:43.361 --> 22:47.013
No. Then, I guess if I had 65 hours...

22:48.442 --> 22:51.010
It's a highly complex procedure.

22:51.013 --> 22:54.637
Well, the Pinkerton, it
seems, is no Peterman.

22:55.017 --> 22:57.168
If I could crack safes the
way you crack walnuts...

22:57.169 --> 23:00.387
with your bare skull, I'd be
riding The Oriental First Class

23:00.388 --> 23:02.958
- to Yokohama right now.
- In short, you cannot gain access

23:02.958 --> 23:05.495
- to this strongbox?
- I didn't say that...

23:05.844 --> 23:07.544
Not when there's gunpowder.

23:07.545 --> 23:09.597
Jackson, you will not damage
the contents of this safe.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.323
You will keep them pristine. They are key.

23:11.324 --> 23:13.795
Did I say gelignite? No, I said gunpowder.

23:13.796 --> 23:14.996
Have a little faith.

23:14.997 --> 23:17.813
Be quick at it, then. And
these, these bottles...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.867
What do they contain that
their contents must be hidden?

23:19.867 --> 23:21.741
You have your work cut out, Captain.

23:21.743 --> 23:23.614
Well, it's just as well
I'm out of bourbon, then.

23:23.614 --> 23:25.997
I have something for you
in return, nonetheless.

23:25.997 --> 23:28.173
The strike that killed
the chemist went deep,

23:28.173 --> 23:29.917
and the brain matter's been burnt.

23:30.657 --> 23:33.953
It's a chemical burn caused
by a strong caustic alkali.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.301
The shop was full of chemicals.

23:35.301 --> 23:37.696
No, these are elements
chemists don't deal in.

23:38.163 --> 23:40.599
There's calcium silicate, calcium sulphate.

23:41.030 --> 23:44.662
It suggests to me, uh, uh, Portland cement.

23:44.663 --> 23:45.863
Mortar?

23:46.059 --> 23:49.094
The weapon was a tool... a builder.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.226
Sergeant, construction sites.

23:51.807 --> 23:53.058
Yes, sir.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.641
We were called to a disturbance
at a site not long since.

23:56.642 --> 23:59.343
Obsidian Tenements.

23:59.445 --> 24:01.201
Here. Affray.

24:01.202 --> 24:04.508
Mr. Edwin Havelock, accused of
assault, but charges were not brought.

24:04.508 --> 24:05.364
Where is the ledger from the

24:05.365 --> 24:07.013
- Sutherland Buildings?
- Mm-hmm.

24:11.226 --> 24:13.105
Sergeant, Duncan...

24:13.363 --> 24:16.609
Havelock. Mrs. Mary Havelock.

24:16.610 --> 24:18.357
What is affray?

24:20.846 --> 24:23.179
Thilda? Where's Mrs. Forbes?

24:25.200 --> 24:26.700
You are alone?

24:27.320 --> 24:29.458
Well, I-I'm escaped.

24:31.329 --> 24:34.139
You do not go about alone.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.407
You do not wander the streets unprotected.

24:38.874 --> 24:41.492
Drake, will you go to Obsidian
Tenement to question Mrs. Havelock?

24:41.492 --> 24:42.957
I have business of my own to be answered.

24:42.957 --> 24:44.823
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

24:46.580 --> 24:50.298
Take this note to Miss Cobden
and bring her back with you.

24:51.287 --> 24:53.749
Do not return without her.

25:06.003 --> 25:07.803
Bennet!

25:15.257 --> 25:18.333
I wish to inform you of my new address,

25:18.451 --> 25:20.872
for I've left the Morton house.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.784
Miss Susan's taken me in.

25:22.784 --> 25:29.314
I'm now a resident at Obsidian,
should you need... wish to send for me.

25:30.113 --> 25:34.339
You lodge with Miss Hart?
I cannot be glad at that.

25:34.518 --> 25:36.018
She is my friend.

25:36.019 --> 25:39.396
She's friend only to herself
and her own interests.

25:39.948 --> 25:42.206
She has ever been good to me,

25:42.279 --> 25:45.568
- and you've no call to speak as though...
- I would not have you living there.

25:47.532 --> 25:50.387
I must to work. A man has been murdered.

25:50.564 --> 25:52.433
Please, Rose, trust me in this.

25:52.434 --> 25:54.149
I think only of your happiness.

25:54.980 --> 25:59.216
I shall send to you later.
Let us walk out together.

26:12.097 --> 26:14.964
I am police. Inspector Drake.

26:15.122 --> 26:17.405
I seek a Mr. Edwin Havelock.

26:18.575 --> 26:21.270
We fear for his wife, Mary.

26:22.775 --> 26:24.207
He's not married.

26:26.611 --> 26:28.077
You are?

26:28.436 --> 26:30.470
George Tait, sir.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.188
Don't know where he is.
He's been gone all day.

26:35.854 --> 26:37.954
This Mary, then... you know her?

26:38.383 --> 26:39.923
She's his girl?

26:43.116 --> 26:45.231
I do not know his affairs, sir.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.532
You see him,

26:50.236 --> 26:53.157
You tell Mr. Havelock
we're looking for him.

26:54.561 --> 26:56.330
Good day to you, Mr. Tait.

27:05.874 --> 27:09.126
Well Edmund... as you see, I am come.

27:09.193 --> 27:12.030
I had, after all, little
choice in the matter.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.245
Forgive my roughness, Jane,
you will I think understand.

27:23.785 --> 27:25.592
Hello, Mathilda.

27:30.239 --> 27:32.281
Edmund, how is it she is here?

27:32.362 --> 27:35.147
She will not abide Mrs.
Forbes, our governess.

27:35.148 --> 27:37.188
She has escaped her, come
here of her own volition,

27:37.188 --> 27:39.246
unchaperoned, through these streets.

27:39.328 --> 27:41.594
She will, I think, willingly
stay with you again,

27:41.594 --> 27:43.165
if you will watch her for me.

27:43.855 --> 27:46.949
You may always depend upon me, Edmund.

27:47.413 --> 27:52.169
Only do not, I beg of you, presume.

27:53.503 --> 27:55.427
I do not know what else to do.

27:56.063 --> 27:57.633
Whom else should I ask?

27:57.633 --> 27:59.344
You must ask yourself.

27:59.626 --> 28:02.142
Why is it she escapes her governess?

28:02.495 --> 28:04.966
Why come here? Why find you?

28:06.649 --> 28:10.013
It is because she must be near you,

28:11.092 --> 28:12.702
her daddy.

28:14.440 --> 28:18.848
And you must always be with
the dead of Whitechapel.

28:19.166 --> 28:22.339
I cannot imagine what it is
that keeps you here, Edmund,

28:22.340 --> 28:24.104
but you must discard this notion,

28:24.105 --> 28:25.905
however flattering to yourself,

28:25.962 --> 28:29.679
that the souls of this ward
all depend upon your protection.

28:30.577 --> 28:33.031
In truth, there is only one.

28:33.685 --> 28:36.252
Her needs are your only concern.

28:36.316 --> 28:37.901
Her happiness,

28:37.901 --> 28:40.533
her health, her schooling.

28:42.918 --> 28:46.591
Look to it, Edmund.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.043
Mary! Mary!

29:22.606 --> 29:23.806
My girl.

29:26.589 --> 29:28.403
Shall I die?

29:28.908 --> 29:33.511
Only... I feel peril is close...

29:34.279 --> 29:36.694
and I can't leave George.

29:37.157 --> 29:39.990
Father and mother he's been to me.

29:40.982 --> 29:42.751
Will he ever forgive me?

29:43.811 --> 29:47.680
You will not die. I've made sure of it.

29:52.654 --> 29:55.564
But there is grief for you.

29:58.201 --> 30:00.868
I shall never have a child more, shall I?

30:02.297 --> 30:04.153
Who were these men?

30:04.855 --> 30:09.549
Who is this doctor who hurt
you? Will you not name him?

30:12.941 --> 30:15.041
Are you the man who's
brought her to this pass?

30:16.644 --> 30:20.384
Mary! Mary Tait! My daughter!

30:23.302 --> 30:24.502
You.

30:25.955 --> 30:28.854
Oh, no... but you had to have her...

30:30.734 --> 30:31.934
George!

30:31.935 --> 30:33.934
No!

30:33.935 --> 30:36.977
You have her then, did
ya?! Show her you did!

30:36.977 --> 30:38.297
You're the man!

30:44.086 --> 30:47.488
Shut your mouth! Both of you will be quiet!

30:49.077 --> 30:53.161
Sir, a young lady, brought
in, in much distress,

30:53.256 --> 30:54.889
Lead poisoning, haemorrhaging.

30:54.890 --> 30:57.699
This man, a Mr. George
Tait... I've met him before.

30:57.699 --> 30:59.011
Her father, it seems.

30:59.012 --> 31:01.180
Assaults this, a Mr. Edwin Havelock,

31:01.181 --> 31:03.257
Him having seduced the young lady

31:03.257 --> 31:04.944
and brought her to this trouble.

31:04.945 --> 31:06.462
She is too ill to be moved.

31:06.463 --> 31:08.042
Dr. Frayn forbids questioning.

31:08.043 --> 31:09.694
Her life in peril.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.768
Mr. Havelock, we've been looking for you.

31:14.918 --> 31:19.067
Mr. Glynn! Mr. Glynn!
You will explain yourself.

31:19.321 --> 31:21.745
You have trebled your terms.

31:21.746 --> 31:25.575
These dwellings, Mr. Glynn, are intended
for the working poor of our parish,

31:25.575 --> 31:27.974
and you would turn a
profit at their expense.

31:27.974 --> 31:30.798
These sums are extortion.
They are not as agreed.

31:30.798 --> 31:32.825
Nothing was agreed,

31:32.826 --> 31:35.701
for poor Mr. Capshaw,
your sulphurous solicitor,

31:35.702 --> 31:39.045
met his well-deserved fate
long before ink had met paper.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.466
You shook hands on the deal
yourself with Mr. Capshaw.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.011
It was a gentlemen's agreement.

31:43.224 --> 31:44.639
Or are you not a gentleman?

31:44.640 --> 31:46.506
Or does a gentleman take his advantage?

31:46.507 --> 31:47.707
No, I think not.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.140
If I must explain to you, madam,

31:49.141 --> 31:51.190
that it is the very nature of business

31:51.191 --> 31:52.861
to take one's advantage,

31:52.911 --> 31:55.312
then my convictions as
to the fitness of ladies

31:55.313 --> 31:57.690
for the pursuit of commercial
affairs remain unshaken.

31:57.691 --> 32:01.610
I'm afraid, madam, that a contract
unsigned is not a contract.

32:02.051 --> 32:05.578
Find yourself another Capshaw
and desist from this dabbling

32:05.578 --> 32:06.904
in men's work.

32:07.035 --> 32:09.559
No, Mr. Glynn. I shall find no other.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.545
I shall be my own Mr. Capshaw.

32:11.545 --> 32:12.855
And when you meet me next,

32:12.855 --> 32:15.721
you will wish for that
smooth assassin back,

32:15.721 --> 32:17.096
for he will seem a lamb.

32:21.969 --> 32:26.610
Mr. Edwin Havelock, Mary
Tait, pregnant by you,

32:26.610 --> 32:28.715
sought a termination
from the chemist, Currie,

32:28.716 --> 32:30.560
and suffered grievously for it.

32:30.561 --> 32:34.545
The man, Currie, now dead, at your
hand in revenge for her suffering.

32:34.546 --> 32:36.496
What? No.

32:36.751 --> 32:38.270
No, I haven't killed anyone.

32:38.420 --> 32:41.404
Your quarrel with Mr. Tait...
what is the nature of it?

32:41.404 --> 32:44.335
He refused me! He refused me Mary.

32:44.336 --> 32:47.041
I-I asked permission to
court her, and he denied me.

32:47.042 --> 32:50.856
And court her you did and more. You
seduced her and began this whole sorry tale.

32:50.857 --> 32:52.271
I saved her life.

32:53.064 --> 32:55.588
I found her in her own home, his own, mind,

32:55.588 --> 32:57.499
with the blood running out of her.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.116
But she won't have a doctor.

32:59.162 --> 33:01.508
"No," she says, "or
all will be discovered."

33:01.509 --> 33:03.551
That's her words. So you ask him, right.

33:04.323 --> 33:05.665
You ask him why his precious girl

33:05.666 --> 33:07.250
would rather die than give him away.

33:13.456 --> 33:15.089
What is that?

33:15.132 --> 33:16.616
Gunpowder.

33:17.274 --> 33:20.033
Chinese, naturally.

33:21.762 --> 33:23.806
And does it not belong in here?

33:23.874 --> 33:25.074
Huh?

33:25.710 --> 33:26.910
Jesus!

33:27.187 --> 33:28.387
Gimme that!

33:32.467 --> 33:35.024
Little girl, you can not be in here.

33:36.898 --> 33:39.144
Reid, your child's loose!

33:39.186 --> 33:40.386
Grace.

33:44.417 --> 33:47.429
Come now, Miss Reid, you must
stay upstairs, as your pa said.

33:58.151 --> 33:59.351
My Rose,

33:59.352 --> 34:01.499
your Bennet, you sought him out?

34:01.500 --> 34:03.634
Do you wonder still at his intentions?

34:03.700 --> 34:07.055
I have no doubt, he
means to make me his wife.

34:10.141 --> 34:12.562
This is a sad smile, indeed.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.792
Mm.

34:15.274 --> 34:16.893
But of course,

34:17.505 --> 34:20.523
as song bird of Blewett's,
she shall sing no more.

34:20.974 --> 34:24.009
She shall be in her
nest, feeding her chicks.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.319
And can a woman not be
a mother and a singer?

34:30.237 --> 34:32.674
I think that must depend on the husband.

34:36.132 --> 34:39.158
Sometimes, I'm more complicated
to think on than the old life.

34:40.428 --> 34:41.702
Mm.

34:42.427 --> 34:45.842
I confess there are times
when I would gladly give up

34:45.842 --> 34:48.911
this grand palace and go back
to the old rotten cathouse.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.054
Mmm!

34:51.510 --> 34:52.710
Yes!

34:52.835 --> 34:58.969
My friends around me, my
hopes, for awhile, fulfilled.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.196
Come now!

35:00.794 --> 35:06.066
And enjoy the attentions
of Mr. Fitzroy, Mr. Lloyd?

35:06.367 --> 35:10.642
Those... salty, groping wretches,

35:10.643 --> 35:12.665
so full of their own importance?

35:12.666 --> 35:15.571
All their business, all their dealings.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.390
I... I couldn't understand
a word half the time.

35:20.053 --> 35:23.513
All those men, telling all their secrets.

35:24.871 --> 35:27.007
Mr. Nathaniel Glynn.

35:27.931 --> 35:29.457
Do you remember him?

35:29.458 --> 35:30.957
How could I forget?

35:31.323 --> 35:33.694
Which girl did he favour? Remind me.

35:33.695 --> 35:35.228
Lily.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.618
And poor Lily... he favours her still.

35:40.533 --> 35:43.011
The powder will blow the lock mechanism...

35:43.098 --> 35:45.136
The weight of the machine will,

35:45.136 --> 35:49.101
at the same moment,
release the door, I believe.

35:49.590 --> 35:51.778
Did we not pay for that
machine at great expense?

35:51.779 --> 35:52.979
We did, sir.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.339
Horrible clackety racket
of a thing... never use it.

35:55.340 --> 35:57.121
You are sure, Captain Jackson,

35:57.122 --> 35:59.478
This operation will not
destroy the safe, its contents,

35:59.479 --> 36:01.618
this room, and half my station house?

36:01.836 --> 36:03.381
I'm not sure.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.534
Jackson, you will master this paperwork.

36:35.536 --> 36:38.716
- What am I your secretary now?
- You are my medic, are you not?

36:38.717 --> 36:41.222
And this, I believe, is medical work.

36:41.709 --> 36:43.041
Jackson.

36:43.273 --> 36:45.852
Jackson, you will not leave
this room until you have

36:45.852 --> 36:47.255
conned the meaning of these papers.

36:47.255 --> 36:50.520
Be quick at it. For there are two lines
of inquiry that now separate before us.

36:50.520 --> 36:54.490
The quarrel between Edwin Havelock
and George Tait, over the girl Mary,

36:54.491 --> 36:58.533
the victim of Mr. Currie. How their
dispute touches upon his murder is unclear.

36:58.533 --> 37:00.562
But this... this medical facility.

37:00.562 --> 37:02.725
God only knows what villainy is made there.

37:03.139 --> 37:05.239
We're moving the prisoner now, sir!

37:15.060 --> 37:16.939
Mr. George Tait, sir.

37:17.060 --> 37:21.013
Mary Tait he describes as
his daughter, born 1875.

37:21.182 --> 37:24.294
There's no birth certificate
for a Mary Tait of Whitechapel,

37:24.304 --> 37:26.731
No record of her, nor of him, the father.

37:26.732 --> 37:28.038
Might he have adopted her?

37:28.039 --> 37:30.840
There's no evidence of that,
sir, no legal account of it.

37:31.047 --> 37:33.962
Indeed, I'm hard-pushed
to find much legal account

37:33.963 --> 37:35.229
of George Tait at all.

37:35.266 --> 37:37.472
He has no rate book for his property, sir.

37:37.841 --> 37:40.814
Indeed, the address he has
given, he calls it Shelley Walk,

37:40.814 --> 37:42.442
but I cannot find the street.

37:42.799 --> 37:47.030
There is a patch of wasteland, Shelly's
Ground, and on it some poor dwellings...

37:47.031 --> 37:48.231
self-made.

37:48.237 --> 37:49.437
He is a squatter.

37:49.456 --> 37:51.943
My belief, sir, is that
you are looking at a man,

37:51.969 --> 37:54.206
as lives his entire
life outside of the law.

37:59.870 --> 38:03.173
Can you tell me, sir?
I'm anxious for my Mary.

38:03.173 --> 38:04.435
Can you tell me how she fares?

38:04.435 --> 38:09.416
We will bring news of her, but she's
not your daughter, as you claim.

38:12.356 --> 38:13.938
Not by blood.

38:15.589 --> 38:18.018
But I've been her protector for five years,

38:19.093 --> 38:21.109
since she was 15.

38:25.719 --> 38:27.625
You are a brick setter,

38:27.712 --> 38:30.108
Hm? An ordinary man.

38:31.016 --> 38:32.216
Yes, sir.

38:32.857 --> 38:36.392
No, Mr. Tait, not ordinary.

38:37.044 --> 38:39.712
For you do not officially exist.

38:41.882 --> 38:45.084
You are a convict, perhaps.

38:45.328 --> 38:47.428
But I see no mark.

38:47.555 --> 38:50.401
Or an absconder, fled from the army.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.612
Navy?

38:51.751 --> 38:53.236
No, sir.

38:54.209 --> 38:56.708
A convict I never was.

38:58.411 --> 39:00.672
Though a prisoner, surely.

39:02.123 --> 39:04.304
Absconded, fled?

39:04.903 --> 39:07.219
No, but escaped.

39:08.983 --> 39:11.514
I've never sailed the sea, sir.

39:12.462 --> 39:15.243
I've never left the bounds of this borough.

39:16.550 --> 39:19.518
But I've been to places
I've thought never to see.

39:20.128 --> 39:24.904
I do not like riddles, Mr. Tait.

39:24.992 --> 39:28.656
It stands thus... you
are an illegitimate man

39:28.826 --> 39:31.371
With an illegitimate relation to a girl,

39:31.828 --> 39:34.501
A girl who is alone in this
world and at your mercy.

39:34.502 --> 39:35.888
Let me put this to you.

39:36.176 --> 39:39.205
You took your pleasure off
her, and she fell pregnant,

39:39.206 --> 39:40.718
but the solution to this evidence

39:40.719 --> 39:43.193
of your violation proved
unspeakably brutal,

39:43.487 --> 39:45.124
her sufferings unimaginable,

39:45.125 --> 39:46.875
so in your remorse and your guilt,

39:46.876 --> 39:49.491
you... you killed the man. The chemist,

39:49.532 --> 39:52.350
Currie, the practitioner of this...

39:52.351 --> 39:53.970
Violate?

39:55.779 --> 39:58.354
Oh, sir, you don't know what you say.

39:59.891 --> 40:02.275
Oh, my only thought in life to spare her,

40:03.460 --> 40:05.205
save her from the vile attentions of men

40:05.205 --> 40:07.654
and the sorrowful consequences upon her.

40:09.057 --> 40:10.923
And you would kill for her,

40:10.924 --> 40:14.492
would you, this precious girl?

40:14.806 --> 40:18.835
No, sir. I'm no a killer.

40:23.355 --> 40:24.555
Madam!

40:24.556 --> 40:25.756
Madam!

40:26.149 --> 40:27.750
You can't come in here.

40:29.663 --> 40:31.500
This is a gentleman's club.

40:33.579 --> 40:34.983
There are strict rules.

40:38.245 --> 40:39.758
Mr. Nathaniel Glynn,

40:39.758 --> 40:42.596
a works contractor who
reneges on his contracts.

40:43.754 --> 40:46.655
But you will not renege on our contract.

40:46.657 --> 40:48.501
No, you will sign it now,

40:48.501 --> 40:51.426
in front of your fine
friends and associates.

40:52.032 --> 40:54.682
The price is as at first agreed.

40:54.931 --> 40:57.361
Madam, you must leave here at once.

40:57.361 --> 41:01.203
Or should I inform these good gentlemen

41:01.585 --> 41:03.452
of the false terms under which

41:03.452 --> 41:05.707
you have engaged their investments?

41:06.721 --> 41:09.912
The Witham Fields Land Deal, for example.

41:09.914 --> 41:13.079
Hmm, you sold the land at a premium

41:13.080 --> 41:16.181
on the promise of rents of ã3,000 a year,

41:16.487 --> 41:18.565
This on the assumption of interest from

41:18.566 --> 41:20.987
the East End Dwellings
Company for the building

41:20.987 --> 41:22.768
- of their model dwellings...
- What of it?

41:22.769 --> 41:26.646
...when you had already
been advised by Mr. Trafford

41:26.711 --> 41:30.535
as to the unsuitability of
the land for construction.

41:31.748 --> 41:36.438
I have the letter here,
dated 2nd of February,

41:36.889 --> 41:39.691
withdrawing their interest.

41:41.518 --> 41:42.851
How did you come by that?

41:42.852 --> 41:44.052
Hmm.

41:45.783 --> 41:48.850
This woman has lost her
wits to come to this place,

41:48.852 --> 41:51.808
to believe she may dictate terms to me.

41:51.808 --> 41:53.453
You may dismiss me, gentlemen,

41:53.453 --> 41:56.171
as a one-time runner of saloon whores,

41:56.695 --> 42:00.028
but I remember many a face in this room.

42:02.698 --> 42:07.703
Be advised that the secrets
you spilled in my stews

42:07.705 --> 42:11.463
to the faceless girls from
whom you took your pleasure...

42:11.660 --> 42:15.810
the boastings and vauntings
you made in your cups...

42:15.814 --> 42:17.973
now belong to me,

42:18.658 --> 42:21.523
to dispense as I see fit.

43:06.551 --> 43:09.458
You have been too much
at the oysters, Miss Hart.

43:10.542 --> 43:13.899
or is it the port wine
has turned your stomach?

43:14.115 --> 43:16.215
Oh, I do not blame you.

43:16.217 --> 43:19.593
I should seek oblivion
myself, if I were you.

43:20.324 --> 43:22.210
State your business.

43:23.104 --> 43:24.804
Theodore Swift.

43:25.126 --> 43:27.604
Your father is my business.

43:28.863 --> 43:30.843
He's none of mine.

43:32.049 --> 43:34.180
- He has dissolved his businesses,
- _

43:34.538 --> 43:35.872
liquidated his assets,

43:35.873 --> 43:38.404
his houses in New York, Newport, Chicago,

43:38.406 --> 43:40.573
swathed in dust sheets, void of life.

43:40.575 --> 43:43.643
If you mean to vomit
again, pray mind my shoes.

43:45.534 --> 43:47.287
I know nothing of it.

43:48.850 --> 43:50.698
Theodore P. Swift...

43:51.495 --> 43:55.971
hounded out of this very life,
forced to wander the boundless seas...

43:56.354 --> 43:59.474
forced to find sanctuary
for his ill-gotten money.

43:59.475 --> 44:02.414
Where, oh, where might he find safe haven.

44:02.775 --> 44:07.136
Of all the world's glittering cities,
which might he choose to call home?

44:08.236 --> 44:10.456
He will get no welcome here.

44:10.651 --> 44:12.935
I have no converse with
the man, nor mean to.

44:12.936 --> 44:15.876
He is the furthest, coldest stranger to me.

44:16.866 --> 44:21.657
But never for long, Miss
Hart, not if he has his way.

44:22.462 --> 44:25.658
You find him at you door, send word.

44:25.744 --> 44:27.445
I should be much obliged.

44:37.498 --> 44:39.762
Did someone in 'ere send
for a strawberry ice?

44:39.762 --> 44:40.962
No.

44:41.469 --> 44:43.668
No? Oh, I shall take it back then.

44:43.694 --> 44:44.894
Uncle Bennet!

44:54.822 --> 44:56.766
Must I stay in here all day?

44:56.897 --> 44:58.263
It's very boring.

44:58.572 --> 45:01.769
Eat up girl, else it
will be a strawberry melt.

45:06.658 --> 45:08.405
What do you make of this...

45:09.016 --> 45:12.550
"A convict I never was, but a prisoner.

45:13.562 --> 45:15.453
I've never left these streets,

45:15.455 --> 45:18.556
but I've been to places
I never thought to see."

45:21.894 --> 45:23.376
What is it?

45:24.512 --> 45:25.964
It is a riddle.

45:26.631 --> 45:29.487
Not a convict, but a prisoner.

45:30.169 --> 45:32.319
A prisoner who has committed no crime.

45:32.788 --> 45:34.014
That's right...

45:36.198 --> 45:38.391
Places I never thought to see...

45:38.413 --> 45:39.613
Yeah.

45:40.543 --> 45:42.535
Little girl, you can't be in here.

45:43.969 --> 45:45.584
Is it a girl?

45:46.367 --> 45:50.263
I don't think so, my dear.

45:52.548 --> 45:53.801
I have done nothing wrong,

45:53.801 --> 45:55.798
and I'm made to sit in rooms all day,

45:55.798 --> 45:57.828
and doors are shut upon me.

45:59.127 --> 46:01.448
It is why I must escape always.

46:01.449 --> 46:03.682
It's why I must run from Mrs. Forbes.

46:03.684 --> 46:05.084
And I'm always told,

46:05.086 --> 46:07.377
"This is no place for you, little girl."

46:08.656 --> 46:11.933
Donald, Mr. Tait's personal effects.

46:13.594 --> 46:14.794
Ta.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.513
I shall keep hold of this, if I may.

46:26.484 --> 46:30.825
_

46:43.594 --> 46:45.995
You come to restate your case?

46:46.267 --> 46:47.846
Miss Hart,

46:48.301 --> 46:52.270
If you could know the
despair of these women.

46:53.404 --> 46:56.057
To give them some agency,

46:56.058 --> 46:59.415
that their lives should not be
entirely beyond their control...

47:03.785 --> 47:05.652
I would remind you, Miss Hart,

47:05.917 --> 47:10.273
that I once rendered service
to you, unquestioningly,

47:10.767 --> 47:14.049
and in that made myself an
accessory to a black deed

47:14.050 --> 47:16.827
that I have not spoken of thus far.

47:16.828 --> 47:18.412
You need say no more.

47:18.870 --> 47:20.788
You need not stoop so low.

47:21.173 --> 47:23.236
My thinking has changed.

47:23.286 --> 47:24.616
Has met your own.

47:28.058 --> 47:30.794
I will match your courage, Dr. Frayn.

47:30.857 --> 47:33.270
I will fund this endeavour.

47:33.407 --> 47:35.819
You have taken the wind from my sails.

47:35.820 --> 47:38.204
Y-you spoke so strongly.

47:38.258 --> 47:40.378
Your need to be... legitimate.

47:40.378 --> 47:41.578
Legitimacy...

47:42.679 --> 47:44.720
it is a promise that is a lie.

47:45.184 --> 47:49.619
The promise of inclusion, but it's
true purpose is to exclude, to control.

47:54.074 --> 47:57.509
I am pregnant, Dr. Frayn, and unmarried.

48:01.990 --> 48:05.350
Is it not delicious?

48:05.819 --> 48:07.686
Had I stayed a madam,

48:08.132 --> 48:10.745
I should have done as I
pleased in this matter.

48:10.906 --> 48:13.742
But I wished to be respectable.

48:15.486 --> 48:18.845
It seems I must choose my prison.

48:20.646 --> 48:23.403
These are records of medical procedures.

48:23.704 --> 48:25.470
This is a case study.

48:25.904 --> 48:27.819
It describes four treatments,

48:28.127 --> 48:29.819
each time a different instrument.

48:29.819 --> 48:32.051
But records that at the
end of these four visits,

48:32.051 --> 48:33.901
her bleeding is still not brought on,

48:34.501 --> 48:37.082
for that is not the purpose of this work.

48:37.158 --> 48:42.002
The purpose of this work is
not treatment, but research.

48:42.506 --> 48:44.389
My thinking is this.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.659
A woman comes to this man for help,

48:47.661 --> 48:49.666
but he only pretends to treat her.

48:50.711 --> 48:52.995
In fact, he conducts his research

48:54.006 --> 48:55.769
only at last giving her
what she's asked for,

48:55.770 --> 48:57.462
once he's gotten what he needs from her.

48:57.569 --> 48:59.403
Then these are experiments?

48:59.403 --> 49:02.895
These are experiments upon living subjects,

49:03.161 --> 49:05.167
and unknown to them.

49:06.699 --> 49:08.255
I can't fathom it,

49:09.099 --> 49:10.628
there's not enough to go on here...

49:10.629 --> 49:13.292
but whatever it is he seeks, he's not done.

49:13.453 --> 49:15.953
He records here that
he's not yet satisfied,

49:15.955 --> 49:17.655
that he requires more cases,

49:18.499 --> 49:20.252
A greater and larger practice.

49:20.252 --> 49:23.138
Who is this man? Can we
know? He's a doctor, clearly.

49:23.138 --> 49:25.459
I'm ahead of you. Here.

49:25.878 --> 49:28.499
I found this invoice amongst his papers,

49:28.501 --> 49:32.007
an order made to a Dutch
company, Alder Smits.

49:32.874 --> 49:35.373
Grace can wire Tilbury Docks.

49:46.085 --> 49:48.452
Here's some strange reading, Mr. Tait.

49:48.873 --> 49:50.275
Will you hear it?

49:51.150 --> 49:52.350
Yes, sir.

49:59.465 --> 50:02.600
"An inquest was held on
the body of a labouring man.

50:02.602 --> 50:06.103
It transpired that the
deceased, known as Harry Stokes,

50:06.105 --> 50:10.841
was in reality a woman,
named Harriet Stokes...

50:10.843 --> 50:13.858
had for 30 years worked as a coal heaver."

50:15.905 --> 50:18.349
Strange tale indeed, sir.

50:21.287 --> 50:25.756
"A convict I never was, but a prisoner.

50:26.269 --> 50:28.092
I never left these streets,

50:28.094 --> 50:30.818
but I've been to places
I never thought to see."

50:35.134 --> 50:38.240
You fled the bounds of a woman's life.

50:39.547 --> 50:41.739
You put on a man's clothes.

50:41.741 --> 50:44.175
You were free to do as you please,

50:44.825 --> 50:49.031
go to places you would not else be welcome.

50:49.882 --> 50:54.285
And Mary... you meant to save her, too,

50:54.287 --> 50:56.985
from the perils of a woman's existence.

50:57.552 --> 51:00.161
But they caught her nonetheless.

51:01.461 --> 51:03.233
The injustice of it,

51:03.429 --> 51:09.133
that she should fall into the
hands of a man like Currie.

51:09.682 --> 51:13.149
And just as you'd built your own life,

51:13.920 --> 51:16.707
so you served your own justice on him.

51:17.004 --> 51:20.461
You are fantastic, sir, in your thinking.

51:28.221 --> 51:30.421
And this little girl...

51:32.663 --> 51:35.749
...who I first imagined
to be your sister...

51:38.698 --> 51:40.464
...is in fact yourself.

51:42.034 --> 51:43.667
And this...

51:43.669 --> 51:47.167
this fine lady, your good mother.

51:48.332 --> 51:49.617
Praise her.

51:55.315 --> 51:58.296
You have unmanned me.

52:10.490 --> 52:12.665
Oh, my mother.

52:17.572 --> 52:19.284
12 children she had.

52:20.565 --> 52:21.770
Year on year,

52:21.771 --> 52:24.489
they ripped their path
through her and into the world.

52:24.489 --> 52:27.798
My father unheeding,
insisting on his rights.

52:29.520 --> 52:32.173
I ask you, who would be a woman?

52:34.102 --> 52:36.024
Who would be a wife?

52:42.374 --> 52:43.998
My Mary, ah...

52:45.241 --> 52:49.168
...I fought to find her the
best husband or none at all.

52:53.305 --> 52:56.359
But he found her out, this villain.

52:57.436 --> 53:01.115
This Havelock, this wide-mouthed swaggerer.

53:03.254 --> 53:07.712
I saw no quality in him, no patience.

53:08.365 --> 53:11.163
I saw my father in him, and I told him, no,

53:11.163 --> 53:12.985
but still he must have her.

53:16.397 --> 53:18.838
Oh, such a sweetness in her.

53:19.329 --> 53:23.466
Tenderest heart, now fallen.

53:24.638 --> 53:27.360
She thought to solve it,
that I might never know.

53:28.976 --> 53:30.658
She claimed illness.

53:30.849 --> 53:34.034
Only at the very last did she confess...

53:36.663 --> 53:38.589
I... I could not...

53:39.180 --> 53:41.331
unmake it.

53:41.399 --> 53:43.239
I couldn't go back.

53:43.885 --> 53:45.616
See her through it.

53:48.570 --> 53:51.044
She bore it all alone.

53:53.226 --> 53:55.226
...devastated,

53:55.227 --> 53:59.034
destroyed by these men
she went to for help.

54:03.072 --> 54:06.618
"Tart," he called her...

54:09.908 --> 54:12.954
...the chemist, the man Currie.

54:14.416 --> 54:16.171
After all he did to her,

54:17.099 --> 54:19.523
after all she suffered,

54:20.514 --> 54:23.796
and I battered him for
it. And I don't regret it.

54:23.796 --> 54:25.720
For he'll hurt no girl more.

54:27.281 --> 54:30.453
My only sorrow is that
I didn't kill 'em both.

54:32.845 --> 54:35.177
For you have murdered me!

54:35.681 --> 54:38.130
But I am the man will hang for it!

54:42.211 --> 54:44.478
I must ask you your true name.

54:52.794 --> 54:56.204
Sarah Elizabeth James.

54:56.728 --> 54:59.429
Sarah Elizabeth James...

55:00.273 --> 55:03.562
I charge you with the murder
of Chemist John Currie.

55:09.333 --> 55:11.537
Jackson, Mary Tait,

55:11.537 --> 55:13.445
made barren by these men, this poor girl.

55:13.445 --> 55:17.900
Could her wreck be our answer,
the key to this surgeon we seek?

55:18.301 --> 55:23.331
These... potassium
hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide,

55:23.331 --> 55:25.118
lactic acid... it's a birth control,

55:25.118 --> 55:27.049
but all methods are found wanting...

55:27.522 --> 55:30.433
because the experiments were to go further.

55:31.827 --> 55:33.854
Beyond termination?

55:34.694 --> 55:37.409
Sir, Alder Smits, Tilbury.

55:37.533 --> 55:40.385
A consignment came in for
delivery to Obsidian Clinic

55:40.385 --> 55:42.835
for the attention of Dr. Amelia Frayn.

55:49.859 --> 55:53.363
Well, then, let us to work.

55:58.641 --> 56:01.872
Procedure I believe I have now perfected.

56:03.437 --> 56:05.806
A significant advance.

56:05.862 --> 56:08.679
The patient suffers few complications.

56:09.466 --> 56:11.729
The treatment is absolute.

56:15.395 --> 56:18.540
W-what you describe here...

56:18.791 --> 56:20.893
it is sterilisation.

56:21.077 --> 56:23.695
We spoke of safe treatment, contraception,

56:23.695 --> 56:26.501
but you intend sterilisation.

56:28.066 --> 56:31.933
The prevention of unwanted pregnancy
is our common aim, is it not?

56:32.658 --> 56:35.136
I-I thought we understood one another.

56:35.138 --> 56:38.600
If we are to staunch this rascal
multitude, this overrunning,

56:38.601 --> 56:41.107
we must then eradicate
the breeding population.

56:41.107 --> 56:45.097
And is it not logical, that the
most careless should be the first?

56:45.390 --> 56:50.227
I would remind you, sir, that
you speak of human beings.

56:50.729 --> 56:54.248
And you would have me believe
that all human beings are equal.

56:54.854 --> 56:59.525
That the creatures of Whitechapel, are
comparable to myself, my wife, yourself?

57:00.660 --> 57:02.860
These incontinent men and women...

57:02.862 --> 57:05.568
they can not be taught.
They can not be trusted.

57:05.568 --> 57:08.608
Abstinence, chastity...
these are unknown virtues,

57:08.608 --> 57:10.434
and so they breed.

57:10.436 --> 57:12.570
Poverty, sickness,

57:12.572 --> 57:15.439
a million gaping mouths
demanding to be fed,

57:15.441 --> 57:20.173
and in their hunger...
sedition, rebellion, revolution.

57:20.591 --> 57:24.589
A population unrestrained, that
will double three times this century.

57:24.620 --> 57:29.022
You have neutered these
women against their knowledge,

57:29.024 --> 57:30.357
against their will!

57:30.359 --> 57:32.252
They would not otherwise consent.

57:32.795 --> 57:34.628
And you mean to practice it here,

57:34.630 --> 57:37.035
in secret, in my clinic,

57:37.035 --> 57:40.400
On these women who come
to me as their last hope?

57:43.060 --> 57:44.260
Dr. Frayn.

57:45.908 --> 57:49.209
This man, this Anthony Rolle,

57:49.211 --> 57:53.036
It is he... he mutilated
Mary Tait and others.

57:54.116 --> 57:58.983
I flattered myself, that your interest
in me was a mark of my excellence...

57:59.607 --> 58:01.957
I imagined and ally, at last...

58:01.957 --> 58:05.078
who would stand with me
against the silence obscene

58:05.079 --> 58:06.635
of the medical profession,

58:06.685 --> 58:10.366
but you are nothing but a madman.

58:11.032 --> 58:13.032
Dr. Anthony Rolle,

58:13.034 --> 58:16.935
I will see you in shackles for
the miseries you have inflicted.

58:26.514 --> 58:30.702
If he'd only said yes to me.

58:31.521 --> 58:34.082
I'm not such a wretch as he thinks.

58:34.355 --> 58:37.397
Blinded by hate for him, I was. For a time.

58:37.398 --> 58:39.804
'Cause not for that, I wanted you.

58:40.870 --> 58:44.054
If you'd told me, I'd have stood by you.

58:44.507 --> 58:46.090
I'd have done right by you.

58:46.574 --> 58:48.582
He would never have borne it.

58:49.104 --> 58:51.175
And I could never have left him.

58:56.933 --> 58:58.700
Oh, it is cruel.

58:59.480 --> 59:02.114
Must he wear this dress?

59:02.567 --> 59:05.937
Must he be robbed of even his dignity

59:05.937 --> 59:08.069
as he goes to the gallows?

59:09.211 --> 59:13.358
No, it cannot be. T-t-this cannot be.

59:14.686 --> 59:18.359
My dearest girl, forgive
me. I smothered ya.

59:18.359 --> 59:20.365
Oh, my love, it's all right.

59:22.806 --> 59:24.162
Oh, George.

59:24.477 --> 59:27.606
Oh, my George, my father.

59:28.006 --> 59:30.084
You make me this promise.

59:30.226 --> 59:33.844
You live a brave, bright life for yourself,

59:34.558 --> 59:37.195
whatsoever it may be. You choose it.

59:37.283 --> 59:39.085
I saw a home,

59:40.334 --> 59:41.720
a loving husband,

59:42.787 --> 59:45.889
a child for me, a grandchild for you.

59:46.448 --> 59:49.641
Then you find your joy elsewhere...

59:51.085 --> 59:52.906
You live your life full.

59:52.957 --> 59:56.425
Live free, and live true. Mm.

59:56.987 --> 59:58.669
Promise me that.

59:58.778 --> 01:00:01.564
No. No!

01:00:01.566 --> 01:00:02.791
No!

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.816
- Live true, my baby!
- No!

01:00:04.816 --> 01:00:07.847
No! No!

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:10.439
No!

01:00:11.405 --> 01:00:14.127
No!

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.791
I've been practising my hand.

01:00:49.171 --> 01:00:51.890
- Are we finished now?
- For today.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:54.123
Then shall we go to the sea?

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.454
You may take your shoes and socks off...

01:00:58.482 --> 01:01:00.614
- and walk in the water.
- We shall...

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:03.119
but not quite yet.

01:01:03.716 --> 01:01:06.782
We must stay in Whitechapel
just a little while longer.

01:01:06.991 --> 01:01:08.624
But I want to go to the sea.

01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:12.433
You and I, and the birds, and the sunshine.

01:01:12.433 --> 01:01:14.836
I know, my heart, and we shall, we shall.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:18.913
We'll not be long now.

01:01:19.388 --> 01:01:23.122
I stay to bring all to its conclusion

01:01:23.673 --> 01:01:25.976
so that we may both be free.

01:01:30.476 --> 01:01:34.798
I must make apology. I spoke harsh to you.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.747
I have my doubts of Miss Hart,
but they touch not upon you.

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.463
Your bond with her is yours alone.

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:46.022
And... I... I thought it my
right, my place, to govern you,

01:01:46.024 --> 01:01:48.697
to know better of your
happiness than you yourself.

01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:52.697
Rose, I would not be that man,

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:55.412
still less that husband...

01:01:57.295 --> 01:02:00.904
if, that is, it is a
husband you seek in me.

01:02:03.945 --> 01:02:08.152
I will entrust myself to no other.

01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:10.280
Oh!

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.486
I believe it was the
first happiness I ever knew

01:02:16.621 --> 01:02:18.344
to look upon your face.

01:02:19.825 --> 01:02:23.173
Born under a bad sign,
set upon a stark road,

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.819
this boy, Bennet.

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.210
"Blessed," the name means,

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:32.038
but so oft I felt myself cursed,
bound only for a dismal end.

01:02:32.673 --> 01:02:37.088
Rose, I know you've had
some taste of happiness.

01:02:37.357 --> 01:02:41.092
No, I-I'm glad of it. I resent none of it.

01:02:41.093 --> 01:02:45.095
Only I shall not rest
until I have made for you

01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:46.629
that taste a lifetime.

01:02:46.765 --> 01:02:48.332
A perfection.

01:02:48.801 --> 01:02:50.252
Oh, Bennet.

01:02:51.319 --> 01:02:55.991
That content, and the bliss I now know...

01:02:55.991 --> 01:03:00.206
it is... as... sugar water is to honey.

01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:10.201
Here.

01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:15.731
Now, this is none of
your Edgar Morton stuff.

01:03:16.008 --> 01:03:18.528
It is, uh, it is tiny.

01:03:18.778 --> 01:03:21.178
It is but a speck of a thing.

01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:33.663
My Rose.

01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:38.969
How can it be

01:03:39.347 --> 01:03:42.933
that this speck of a thing

01:03:43.578 --> 01:03:46.145
can hold such a world of joy?

01:04:02.578 --> 01:04:04.511
This room becomes you.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.386
Though I guess you were born to
it, huh, to live grand? You...

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:13.331
...you've come full circle.

01:04:13.931 --> 01:04:15.906
It's as if I never was.

01:04:16.914 --> 01:04:21.288
Must we always scratch and hiss at
each other like a pair of alley cats?

01:04:22.305 --> 01:04:26.962
It is well you are here. I
had thought to send for you.

01:04:29.862 --> 01:04:31.896
Well, I await upon your pleasure.

01:04:34.351 --> 01:04:35.551
Matthew...

01:04:35.552 --> 01:04:36.761
Now...

01:04:40.015 --> 01:04:42.187
What does she plan here?

01:04:43.431 --> 01:04:46.233
Would she have me believe she's human?

01:04:46.234 --> 01:04:48.115
Well, let's see.

01:04:53.128 --> 01:04:55.221
These are fingertips,

01:04:56.747 --> 01:04:59.345
Where I thought to find claws.

01:04:59.346 --> 01:05:01.713
You're determined in your bitterness.

01:05:02.108 --> 01:05:04.110
I have reason to be,

01:05:05.189 --> 01:05:07.512
though it kills something in me.

01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:12.609
I found this.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.910
Remember that day?

01:05:17.142 --> 01:05:20.044
You broke a bone in your
corset from laughin'.

01:05:25.299 --> 01:05:27.274
Laughter is for fools.

01:05:31.479 --> 01:05:33.596
What is this?

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:37.323
Will you never tire of
your schoolboy pranks?

01:05:38.657 --> 01:05:40.156
Miss Susan, there is a man.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:42.629
I did not know what to do.

01:05:50.305 --> 01:05:52.175
Theodore Swift.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.872
It was only a matter of
time before you showed up.

01:05:56.413 --> 01:05:58.268
But of course.

01:06:01.376 --> 01:06:02.816
Father.

01:06:03.389 --> 01:06:05.017
Well?

01:06:05.317 --> 01:06:07.787
Where's my goddamn kiss?

01:06:10.461 --> 01:06:13.036
_

01:06:14.058 --> 01:06:15.912
I disembark here...

01:06:16.262 --> 01:06:17.980
...my bile rises.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:23.267
There is another circle coiled
above me now, another snake.

01:06:23.289 --> 01:06:25.917
Prepare for the wrath of God
to fall on your shoulders.

01:06:28.963 --> 01:06:31.021
It is as you say, Mr. Reid,

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:34.835
damned if we do, and damned if we do not.

01:06:34.835 --> 01:06:37.510
Can you not see
it, sir. The good lady Hart.

01:06:38.725 --> 01:06:42.975
We might act now, see good done.

01:06:43.397 --> 01:06:46.845
I have not killed
a man, in nigh on 15 years!
