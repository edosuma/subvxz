And if you thought
you saw a gray hair,

01:18.382 --> 01:20.550
that was also an illusion.

01:20.584 --> 01:22.585
Remember, I'll be
making myself appear

01:27.392 --> 01:29.393
will also be there

01:33.331 --> 01:35.598

01:35.633 --> 01:37.500
Maybe you can wave
your wand above CeCe

01:37.535 --> 01:39.335
and make her
a better dancer?

01:39.369 --> 01:40.603

and frosting on it?on

No, I was talking about
next to the bun cart.

03:04.527 --> 03:06.428
Hey, she looks
just like Miss Nancy

03:06.463 --> 03:08.564
from Miss Nancy's
Fancy Dance Academy.

03:08.598 --> 03:11.100
Yes. Probably because
it is Miss Nancy

03:11.135 --> 03:13.470
from Miss Nancy's
Fancy Dance Academy.

03:14.305 --> 03:15.405
Oh!

03:17.509 --> 03:19.309
Excuse me.
Hi.

03:19.344 --> 03:21.345
Um, I just
wanted to say hi

03:21.379 --> 03:23.514
and tell you
what a huge impact
you've had on my life.

03:23.548 --> 03:26.484
Oh, did you join the
Bun of the Month Club?

03:26.518 --> 03:28.386
Well, next month
just came in.

03:28.420 --> 03:32.224
Spoiler alert,
it's braided!

03:32.258 --> 03:36.395
No, I'm Rocky Blue.
You were my first
dance teacher.

03:36.429 --> 03:39.498
Oh!
Thank you, Rocky.

03:39.532 --> 03:41.567
Look how tall
you've gotten.

03:43.403 --> 03:45.437
Hey, guys, look.

03:45.472 --> 03:48.507
I'm that princess chick
from that movie all those
old people like.

03:50.410 --> 03:53.546
And CeCe!
You haven't changed at all.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.481
Oh, thank you, Miss Nancy.

03:55.515 --> 03:58.584
Because of you,
we're now dancing
on <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

03:58.618 --> 04:00.185
How are things
at the academy?

04:00.220 --> 04:01.520
Oh, not so good.

04:01.554 --> 04:04.156
The studio is on
the verge of closing

04:04.190 --> 04:07.226
and I'm just desperately
trying to make ends meet
by working at a mall cart.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.430
Hair buns!
One for six! Two for 10!

04:10.464 --> 04:13.266
I'll even throw in
a free bottle of hair spray!

04:14.235 --> 04:16.403
I don't understand.
Is business bad?

04:16.438 --> 04:20.173
Oh, no, but I had
an opportunity to
buy the building.

04:20.208 --> 04:23.144
Well, I have a $3,000
balloon payment

04:23.178 --> 04:24.579
and the building
is upside down.

04:24.613 --> 04:29.283
Wow, even I know
an upside down building
is bad for business.

04:30.519 --> 04:34.455
Wow, CeCe, you really
haven't changed.

04:34.489 --> 04:37.457
(CHUCKLES)
Welcome to my world.

04:37.492 --> 04:40.193
We'll take
two buns, please.

04:40.228 --> 04:41.595
Here you go.
Thank you.

04:42.363 --> 04:43.496
Um...

04:43.531 --> 04:46.333
Bye! Thank you.

04:46.367 --> 04:49.370
I cannot believe
that Miss Nancy's
Fancy Dance Academy

04:49.404 --> 04:52.606
is going out of business.
It's so sad.

04:52.641 --> 04:55.476
Because of Miss Nancy,
we became dancers.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.579
And best friends.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.350
You know what?
We owe Miss Nancy.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.486
We're going to save
that dance studio!

05:03.520 --> 05:05.355
How are we
going to do that?

05:05.389 --> 05:09.192
I don't know,
but you can bet your
buns we're going to.

05:13.330 --> 05:14.397
Yo, dude,
check it out.

05:14.432 --> 05:16.533
I just got the coolest
new app for my phone.

05:16.568 --> 05:18.568
The one that shows
what you look like
as a girl?

05:18.602 --> 05:20.370
Got it!

05:20.405 --> 05:22.606
Check it out.
I'm hot!

05:25.443 --> 05:28.312
I'm just going
to ignore that
and move on.

05:29.414 --> 05:31.282
This one's called
Bump It, Baby.

05:31.317 --> 05:32.550
You can record
your own music

05:32.585 --> 05:34.553
and share it
with friends by bumping.

05:34.587 --> 05:36.288
Oh, cool.
Let me get one
of your new raps.

05:36.522 --> 05:37.589
What...

05:39.526 --> 05:41.293
What the heck was that?

05:41.328 --> 05:43.295
I was bumping you
for your song.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.197
You thought we would
bump hips and music would

05:45.232 --> 05:47.233
magically trade
in our phones?

05:48.268 --> 05:51.403
Sure, now
it sounds stupid.

05:51.437 --> 05:52.604
If you broke
my new YOphone...

05:52.638 --> 05:55.374
Would you relax?
Okay? It's totally fine.

05:55.408 --> 05:58.510
Everyone knows a YOphone is
practically indestructible.

05:58.544 --> 06:00.312
Okay, watch.

06:00.346 --> 06:01.346
(GLASS CRACKING)

06:02.248 --> 06:03.448
Okay, now it's broken.

06:07.353 --> 06:09.421
Hey, how's our
bake sale going?

06:09.456 --> 06:11.157
Really good.

06:11.191 --> 06:13.392
"Save Miss Nancy's
Fancy Dance Academy,

06:13.427 --> 06:16.228
"$16 a cupcake."
Are you crazy?

06:17.431 --> 06:20.199
Who is going
to spend that much
on a cupcake?

06:20.233 --> 06:23.136
Actually,
I've already
sold two dozen.

06:23.170 --> 06:24.404
Oh, and by the way,

06:24.438 --> 06:28.208
I may or may not
have included a kiss
from you for that price.

06:30.344 --> 06:32.412
(LAUGHS) I'm kidding!

06:32.447 --> 06:34.382
Maybe.

06:34.416 --> 06:39.121
Oh, look, Tinka.
The fruitcakes are
selling cupcakes!

06:39.155 --> 06:40.489
This happens
to be a fundraiser.

06:40.523 --> 06:43.459
Well, if you're trying
to earn money to see
a good dermatologist

06:43.494 --> 06:46.362
I'll take one
for each of your
poorly-concealed pimples.

06:47.598 --> 06:50.200
I'll take four.

06:50.468 --> 06:52.301
Ooh, no, five.

06:53.471 --> 06:55.238
Guys, this
is not a joke.

06:55.272 --> 06:56.439
We're trying to
help Miss Nancy,

06:56.473 --> 06:58.508
the woman who
taught us how to dance.

06:58.542 --> 07:02.212
Help her?
She should be imprisoned for
her crimes against humanity.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.248
And the arts.

07:05.282 --> 07:07.450
Seriously, please stop.
We're not kidding.

07:07.484 --> 07:09.451
No, but Miss Nancy
is kidding herself

07:09.486 --> 07:12.254
if she thinks she taught
the two of you how to dance.

07:13.256 --> 07:14.322
You know what?
That's it.

07:14.357 --> 07:17.292
I'm sick and tired
of you guys always
being so mean.

07:17.326 --> 07:19.327
We're trying to do
a nice thing here,

07:19.361 --> 07:21.128
but you two
wouldn't understand

07:21.163 --> 07:23.264
because there's nothing
sweet about you.

07:24.466 --> 07:26.434
So button it,
or else...

07:26.468 --> 07:28.303
Ooh, I'm so scared!

07:28.337 --> 07:31.205
What is a little girl
running a bake sale
going to do?

07:34.343 --> 07:38.146
A pie to the face?
So cliche.

07:38.181 --> 07:41.416
Besides,
you don't have the
cupcakes to do it.

07:41.451 --> 07:42.618
You're right.
She doesn't.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.120
(GASPS)

07:45.154 --> 07:47.390
But I do!

07:48.491 --> 07:50.492
That'll be $32, please.

07:51.628 --> 07:54.596
Mmm, revenge is sweet.

07:59.636 --> 08:02.137
Well,
according to the guy
at the YOphone store,

08:02.172 --> 08:04.306
your friend repeatedly
banging your phone
on the table

08:04.340 --> 08:06.442
is not covered
by the insurance plan.

08:09.179 --> 08:12.081
Dude, I feel awful.

08:12.115 --> 08:14.183
Could you do me a favor
and stop bringing it up?

08:15.486 --> 08:19.489
Thanks to you,
I'm stuck using
my Grandma's old phone.

08:21.426 --> 08:24.128
That's a phone?

08:24.162 --> 08:26.263
There's no screen.
How do you text?

08:26.297 --> 08:29.133
Watch videos?
Listen to music?
Get on the Internet?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.502
You don't.
It just makes calls.

08:31.536 --> 08:34.371
Who uses a cell phone
to make calls?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.243
There's gotta be
another way to
get a new phone.

08:38.277 --> 08:39.277
I know.

08:43.282 --> 08:44.482
In case
you hadn't noticed,

08:44.517 --> 08:45.617
you're done!

08:47.186 --> 08:48.186
Well, then.

08:53.192 --> 08:55.127
We're winning
you a new phone.
Check it out.

08:55.161 --> 08:56.394
All we have to do
is enter the contest

08:56.429 --> 08:59.231
and be the last ones
standing with a phone
in between us.

08:59.265 --> 09:00.599
I don't know.

09:00.633 --> 09:03.134
If I'm going to spend
a whole day holding
hands with someone,

09:03.169 --> 09:04.269
it's not gonna be you.

09:05.438 --> 09:07.439
Come on, man,
let me win you
a new phone.

09:07.474 --> 09:09.208
(PHONE RINGING)

09:09.242 --> 09:12.111
What is that?

09:12.145 --> 09:14.279
Excuse me,
I gotta take this.
What?

09:14.314 --> 09:16.448
Hello? Hey, Grandma.

09:16.482 --> 09:19.218
Yeah, it's working.

09:19.252 --> 09:21.487
What? Grandma?

09:21.521 --> 09:23.388
Hold on, bad reception.

09:28.227 --> 09:31.495
Hello?
Yeah. I got you.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.131
Okay, hold on.
Here we go.

09:38.603 --> 09:41.205
Okay. Grandma?

09:41.239 --> 09:43.407
Grandma? Grandma?

09:44.475 --> 09:46.476
Grandma?
(STUTTERING)

09:48.313 --> 09:50.447
There you go.
Got you, Grandma.

09:54.252 --> 09:57.155
No way!
We're still $1,500 short.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.324
Even after selling
all our old clothes,

09:59.359 --> 10:01.326
putting in all the money
from the bake sale

10:01.361 --> 10:02.494
and all of our savings.

10:02.529 --> 10:04.263
Don't make me feel
bad about the refunds.

10:04.297 --> 10:06.331
I don't care
how many cupcakes
Petey Goldfeder bought.

10:06.366 --> 10:08.267
I was not kissing him.

10:10.269 --> 10:13.338
Guess this is the
end of Miss Nancy's
Fancy Dance Academy.

10:13.373 --> 10:16.441
No!
There's absolutely no way
I'm going to accept that.

10:16.476 --> 10:18.476
There's got to be
something left we can sell.

10:18.511 --> 10:20.445
Well, there's still
our Beyonce tickets.

10:20.479 --> 10:25.416
Okay, looks like this is
the end of Miss Nancy's
Fancy Dance Academy.

10:25.451 --> 10:29.353
Hey, do you remember
that silent auction that
Gary was involved in?

10:29.388 --> 10:33.356
Yeah, the one
that was silent
'cause nobody bid on him.

10:33.391 --> 10:39.228
Yeah.
Maybe he can auction off
an afternoon with us.

10:39.262 --> 10:40.629
Oh! Okay,
let's do that.

10:42.465 --> 10:44.165
Excuse me, Gary.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.202
See, we're raising money
to save our old dance school

10:47.237 --> 10:49.204
and we were hoping
you could auction off

10:49.238 --> 10:52.441
an afternoon
with CeCe and Rocky at
the mall show on Saturday.

10:52.475 --> 10:54.342
Let me think
about it. No.

10:56.346 --> 10:59.481
But, Gary, we're talking

your own personal needs.

11:09.259 --> 11:11.260
Gary, does
<i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

11:11.294 --> 11:14.363
know you're getting
a little pay-off from
this YOphone event?

11:14.397 --> 11:17.399
Five, 10, 25,
75, 85, 95! Sold!

11:18.568 --> 11:20.269
How did you know?

11:20.304 --> 11:22.605
Hmm, I don't know.
Five, 10, 25... (BABBLING)

11:22.639 --> 11:24.372

All right.
Now, let's check in
with our remaining

11:56.408 --> 11:58.275
Oh! That's gotta hurt.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.311
But the
YOphone calling package
won't hurt your wallet.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.446
Only 40 bucks a month.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.281
Unless you're me.
Then it's free.

12:05.451 --> 12:07.451
And now,
one lucky bidder
is going to get

12:07.486 --> 12:10.221
an entire afternoon
with two of

12:10.256 --> 12:13.357

and shakedown artists,
Rocky and CeCe.

12:16.261 --> 12:17.495
What if no one
actually bids on us?

12:17.529 --> 12:20.330
Don't worry.
I already thought of that.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.333
Okay, let's
open the bidding.
Do I hear $100?

12:23.368 --> 12:25.302
One hundred dollars
for a great cause.

12:25.336 --> 12:27.337
I bid $100!

12:27.372 --> 12:30.373
You got $100 to
spend on hanging out
with Rocky and CeCe

12:30.408 --> 12:32.575
and you couldn't just
buy me a new phone?

12:32.610 --> 12:35.511
Would you relax, okay?
I'm only getting
the bidding started.

12:35.545 --> 12:37.146
I'm a plant!

12:37.180 --> 12:39.182
What kind? A dill weed?

12:40.317 --> 12:42.351
Do I see 150? 150!
(WHISPERS) Yes!

12:42.386 --> 12:44.220
I'm looking
for two, 200?

12:44.254 --> 12:47.190
Two hundred from the pretty
lady who should ask for my
number when we're done!

12:47.224 --> 12:48.624
Do I hear three?
Three hundred?

12:48.659 --> 12:50.360
Thank you,
three hundred!

12:50.394 --> 12:52.295
From the man in
the purple shirt
with the sweat stains.

12:52.329 --> 12:54.497
You may put
your hand down now.

12:54.532 --> 12:58.234

Do I hear five?

13:04.274 --> 13:06.175
Five hundred dollars
from the same bidder!

Now, there's a man
who cares about dance.

watch that hand.

13:23.491 --> 13:27.428

13:27.462 --> 13:31.265
Congratulations to the
winning bid of $1,500!

13:33.569 --> 13:37.139
Not as chocolaty
as two cupcakes
shoved in your face,

13:37.174 --> 13:39.375
but just as
surprising, no?

13:45.032 --> 13:48.601
All right, as soon as
Gunther and Tinka pay us the ms

13:48.636 --> 13:50.971
we'll have the $3,000
we need for Miss Nancy.
We did it!

13:51.005 --> 13:54.909
Yes! We did it!
We did it!

13:54.943 --> 13:59.747
Hey, why do you think
they spent all that money
to buy us at the auction?

13:59.781 --> 14:02.916
Well, they walk around
wearing 30 pounds
of sequins and glitter.

14:02.951 --> 14:06.020
Who knows why
they do anything?

14:06.354 --> 14:08.889
I'm just glad
we didn't have to sell
our Beyonce tickets.

14:08.923 --> 14:12.059
Yeah, we should get going.
I want to be the first one

14:12.093 --> 14:13.260

14:20.334 --> 14:22.135
What are you two
doing here?

14:22.170 --> 14:25.339
We spent a lot of money
for an afternoon
with Rocky and CeCe.

14:25.373 --> 14:28.208
Yes, but not this afternoon.
We're going to see Beyonce.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.277
We've been
looking forward
to this for months.

14:30.311 --> 14:33.179
It's either this afternoon
or forget the money
we owe you.

14:34.281 --> 14:36.082
Hey, wait
a minute.

14:36.116 --> 14:39.118
You're only doing this
to get even with us for
embarrassing you at school.

14:39.152 --> 14:40.886
Oh, look, Gunther.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.989
Someone had a big bowl
of smarty-puffs this morning.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.391
Klaus!

14:50.264 --> 14:52.298
This is our
little cousin, Klaus.

14:52.332 --> 14:54.901
Babysit him and your
Miss Nancy will no longer

14:54.935 --> 14:56.969
have to sell her
hairy buns at the mall.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.273
Why, hello,
Rocky and CeCe.

15:00.307 --> 15:03.143
Thank you
for welcoming me
into your wonderful home.

15:03.177 --> 15:05.846
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

15:05.881 --> 15:07.281
BOTH: Aw!

15:07.315 --> 15:09.317

in a few hours after
the Beyonce concert.

What!
Goodbye to all
the single ladies.

15:13.255 --> 15:15.922
Good luck.
I mean, have fun.

15:16.324 --> 15:17.991
No, I mean good luck.

15:22.195 --> 15:25.264
Well, if we're gonna
have to miss Beyonce,

15:25.298 --> 15:27.866
we might as well
spend the time
with a little cutie.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.167
Can I watch <i>Jersey Hills?</i>

15:29.202 --> 15:31.002
Oh, no sweetie.

15:31.037 --> 15:33.940
We don't want you
copying those kids'
bad behavior.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.308
Plus,
we're not allowed
to watch it either.

15:37.077 --> 15:38.344
Okay, let's
play a game.

15:38.379 --> 15:40.080
Oh, fine, we'll play.

15:40.114 --> 15:42.282
Ow! What the heck
kind of game is that?

15:43.284 --> 15:45.219
It's called
Kick You in the Shins.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.356
Okay, how about
we try a new game?

15:48.390 --> 15:50.091
Okay, how about...

Ow! (WHIMPERING)

in the Shins!

15:55.997 --> 15:58.365
How do you
like that, babies?

16:07.274 --> 16:11.110
I told you not to drink
that 84-ounce chug-a-lug!

16:11.145 --> 16:15.982
Well, excuse me if I believe
proper hydration is important
to a growing body.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.252
It took six months
to save up for that phone

16:18.286 --> 16:20.187
and two seconds
for you to break it.

16:20.221 --> 16:22.322
If we drop this phone
because of all your
moving around,

16:22.356 --> 16:25.125
I'm gonna drop you in
that fountain over there.

Man, I can't help it.
I have to go really bad.

16:30.297 --> 16:33.266
Like the blizzard
of '09 bad.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.035
Oh. You mean like
the time when you

16:35.069 --> 16:37.237
spelled your whole name
and address in the snow?

16:37.272 --> 16:40.341
Yeah, that was
pretty impressive.
You just peed and peed...

16:40.375 --> 16:42.944
Would you stop
talking about it, already!

16:42.978 --> 16:45.246

There's a bathroom
break in 10 minutes.

to come in number one.

16:47.383 --> 16:49.917

Deuce, we are a team.

in there.

17:13.273 --> 17:14.942

in there.

just disappear?
I don't know.

scissors was a good idea.

Oh, I didn't
give him the scissors.

his mouth and grabbed them
off the kitchen counter.
