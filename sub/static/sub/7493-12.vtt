WEBVTT

00:04.959 --> 00:06.667
Dude, neither one of these is marked.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.291
Which one's the cheeseburger?

00:10.250 --> 00:13.000
Mmm, this one's cheeseburger,

00:13.083 --> 00:15.208
This one's hamburger.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.375
Oh no, wait. Maybe...

00:17.458 --> 00:18.959
- This one's cheeseburger.
- Dude!

00:19.041 --> 00:20.417
Hey, give me those!

00:22.208 --> 00:23.083
My tooth!

00:23.166 --> 00:24.625
I bit the bone.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.000
There's no bones in a hamburger.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.583
It must have been the cheeseburger.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.417
It really hurts.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.834
You should go see the dentist.

00:30.917 --> 00:33.208
The demonic drill-wielding monster

00:33.291 --> 00:35.792
who steals your teeth
to appease the fairy gods?

00:35.875 --> 00:37.667
No way, Jose!

00:37.750 --> 00:39.500
I love going to see my dentist.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.291
He's got this really
great assistant Holly.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.083
She's always like, "Hey, Rudy."

00:43.166 --> 00:45.125
And I’m like, "Haw-ro."

00:45.208 --> 00:46.709
And she's like, "Good to see you."

00:46.792 --> 00:49.166
And I’m like, "Hawrr..."

00:49.542 --> 00:52.166
It is really tough to talk with all the
dental equipment in your mouth.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.291
It doesn't have anything
to do with the dental equipment.

00:54.375 --> 00:55.875
Look how hot she is.

00:56.417 --> 00:59.000
Haw-ro.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.208
Come on, Jack.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.375
You don't need to find a team.
We're your team.

01:03.458 --> 01:04.333
Guys, the commando battle

01:04.417 --> 01:06.875
is the most elite paintball tournament
in the country.

01:06.959 --> 01:07.959
I really want to win,

01:08.041 --> 01:10.417
but, no offense,
I’m not sure you guys are up to it.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.458
Seriously? I share one bathroom
with seven sisters.

01:13.542 --> 01:17.333
It's a war zone of curling irons,
hairnets and zit cream.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.709
And then there's all their stuff.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.625
This is serious, guys.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.542
The team from the Southold
Military Academy

01:23.625 --> 01:25.000
has won four straight years.

01:25.083 --> 01:27.291
Come on, Jack, you'll be our team leader

01:27.375 --> 01:29.291
- and we'll follow any order you give us.
- Yeah.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.625
You guys really want to do this?

01:31.709 --> 01:33.041
Yeah.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.709
Okay, fine. But from now on,

01:35.792 --> 01:38.542
I’m not your friend Jack.
I am sergeant Jack.

01:38.625 --> 01:40.375
I’m gonna spend the next
three hours teaching you

01:40.458 --> 01:41.917
how to fire your paintball guns.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.417
Aw, let's do this!

01:43.500 --> 01:46.208
But first I’m gonna go to the deli
and grab a little nosh.

01:46.709 --> 01:47.834
Milton!

01:48.667 --> 01:50.208
Seriously, Jack?

01:50.291 --> 01:51.959
Three hours?

01:52.041 --> 01:54.667
It's a paintball gun.
I think we all know how to fire--

01:57.917 --> 01:59.959
Yeah, no, three hours sounds about right.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.959
Wait a minute. I went to sleep at home.

03:03.041 --> 03:04.125
How did I get here?

03:04.208 --> 03:06.291
I had a dream I was picked up
and carried away

03:06.417 --> 03:07.834
by a beautiful sasquatch.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.625
I had the same dream.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.250
You!

03:13.333 --> 03:14.750
Get in line, maggots!

03:15.917 --> 03:17.333
I am not your friend!

03:17.417 --> 03:18.959
I am your drill instructor!

03:19.041 --> 03:20.750
You may have entered
this boot camp as boys,

03:20.834 --> 03:22.959
but you are going to leave as men!

03:23.041 --> 03:25.000
Oh, finally, I’m going
to get some body hair.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.458
Jerry, do you want share a pit stick?

03:26.542 --> 03:27.834
I’ll give you a pit stick!

03:27.917 --> 03:31.125
Put on those backpacks
and move it, move it!

03:37.125 --> 03:39.542
Oh!

03:40.875 --> 03:42.542
Get up, maggot!

03:43.291 --> 03:45.000
All right, Milton, you have 20 seconds

03:45.083 --> 03:48.291
to get out from under your box,
run across the courtyard,

03:48.417 --> 03:49.750
and free Jerry

03:51.542 --> 03:54.458
before this automatic paintball machine
opens fire on him.

03:54.542 --> 03:55.583
Huh?

03:56.875 --> 03:59.291
I get it, testing my courage under fire.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.208
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.500
And go!

04:09.667 --> 04:11.333
It's kind of dark in here.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.083
Ooh, kind of hard to breathe.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.125
Walls are closing in!

04:17.417 --> 04:19.583
Gotta get out of that box, soldier!

04:19.667 --> 04:21.291
I’m freaking out!

04:21.375 --> 04:23.500
Oh, I’m freaking out, I tell ya!

04:26.542 --> 04:28.500
All right, Milton's Gone A.W.O.L., Jerry.

04:28.583 --> 04:29.875
You gotta save yourself.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.000
Jerry?

04:48.625 --> 04:51.333
Oh, what happened to you?

04:54.500 --> 04:56.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

04:56.208 --> 04:59.500
All right, Phil, Holly is a very busy
dental hygienist,

04:59.583 --> 05:01.834
but she's agreed to come down here
and talk to you.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.834
I don't want your dental witch coming.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.417
Once she's here, she'll show her true self

05:05.500 --> 05:08.417
and turn into a hideous beast
with wings and horns.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.500
Ooh! Here she comes.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.834
Be cool, man.

05:13.834 --> 05:14.917
Hey, Rudy.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Haw-ro!

05:17.750 --> 05:19.875
So where's your friend
who's afraid of the dentist?

05:19.959 --> 05:21.250
Oh.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.959
You'll never take me, tooth demon!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.667
I really appreciate you coming down here

05:32.750 --> 05:35.041
and helping calm
my friend's fear of dentists.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.834
Oh, I’m glad to help, Rudy.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.750
Phil?

05:41.834 --> 05:43.375
Let me take a little look
inside your mouth.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.291
No.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.667
- Just a little peek.
- No!

05:46.750 --> 05:47.875
Just open a little bit.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.875
A little bit more.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.875
Little bit...

05:54.000 --> 05:56.542
His tooth is a black
festering mass of rot.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.250
I told you you needed
to make an appointment, Phil.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.625
And Holly's office
is one of the best in the world.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.917
That's right. In fact, world-famous doctor

06:04.000 --> 06:05.625
Bjorn Bjorklund is joining our staff.

06:05.709 --> 06:07.542
And he's coming all the way from Sweden.

06:08.291 --> 06:11.333
But I don't want to go to the dentist.

06:12.125 --> 06:12.959
Aww.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.667
I know how to handle this.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.583
Phil, if you go to the dentist...

06:22.583 --> 06:24.834
...you get to go home

06:25.417 --> 06:27.125
- with this!
-

06:27.208 --> 06:28.291
She is a demon!

06:28.375 --> 06:31.166
She used her powers to turn that balloon
into a weiner dog!

06:42.166 --> 06:45.375
Hey, what are you doing here?
It's not even 6:00 a.m. yet.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.125
Oh, to help us beat Southold,

06:47.208 --> 06:49.458
I’ve been reading this book
on military tactics.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.125
I even practiced a sneak attack on my mom.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.667
Now Jerry and I are working a camouflage.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.834
Look around, Jack.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.709
I’m totally hidden.

07:06.792 --> 07:09.458
See if you can find me. Oooh!

07:11.291 --> 07:12.917
By the way, this is Jerry talking.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.750
Jerry Martinez.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.583
Hmm, I wonder where he could be.

07:18.667 --> 07:22.041
You know, it just makes me so mad
that I can't find him.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.000
Makes me just want to punch something...

07:24.417 --> 07:25.583
Like this dummy.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.792
I would go with the punching bag.

07:27.875 --> 07:31.208
No, no, no. It's definitely
this ugly dummy.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.667
I think he knows I’m here.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Jack, we got here early
because we want you to know

07:40.083 --> 07:41.667
that we're taking this seriously.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.375
We're not going to let you down.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.792
You guys, I, I appreciate that,

07:46.875 --> 07:49.083
but it's not necessary.

07:49.166 --> 07:52.208
- I’m not your leader anymore.
What?

07:53.250 --> 07:56.500
This is lieutenant Donovan
from the Southold Military Academy.

07:56.583 --> 07:57.417
Soldier.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.834
Weakling.

07:59.875 --> 08:01.041
Weirdo.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.458
They asked me to join their squad.

08:04.542 --> 08:05.959
Oh, really?

08:06.417 --> 08:09.875
I bet a big tough guy like you
is going to cry like a baby

08:09.959 --> 08:11.500
when he tells you no!

08:11.917 --> 08:13.834
I told him yes, Jerry.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.500
Oh, he quit our team!

08:15.583 --> 08:18.291
Milton, he quit our team!

08:21.709 --> 08:24.291
I’m sorry, but you two weren't ready
for the commando battle.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.959
I never would have had a chance
with you guys.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.291
This is better for everyone.

08:27.417 --> 08:29.166
How is this better for us?

08:30.250 --> 08:31.625
You're right.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.041
It's better for me.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.500
Tac-ops starts at 0600!

08:35.583 --> 08:38.917
Then we'll hit the D-fac,
-divide our M.R.E.
-S and get some r&r!

08:39.500 --> 08:40.917
I’m sorry, what?

08:41.208 --> 08:42.542
Practice starts in 20 minutes,

08:42.625 --> 08:45.000
then we'll go to Phil's, split a pizza,

08:45.083 --> 08:47.375
and, you know, hang.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.041
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I did.

08:49.125 --> 08:49.959
No, you didn't.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.917
- Now fall in, soldier!

09:48.875 --> 09:50.500

he was looking at my Holly.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.792
I heard you boys dropped out.

11:28.875 --> 11:32.667
We decided to drop back in, your honor!

11:32.750 --> 11:33.792
"Sir."

11:34.125 --> 11:35.709
Your honor, sir!

11:36.792 --> 11:39.750
You guys actually think you have a chance
of winning this competition?

11:39.834 --> 11:41.834
That's a fact, Jack!

11:48.750 --> 11:51.083
Here we go.
We have team green, team orange,

11:51.166 --> 11:52.709
team yellow and team purple.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.500
Actually, it's more of a violet.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.625
It's not violet. Technically,
it's called midnight eggplant.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.250
What? No, it's not, this is violet.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.000
- Have you ever seen an eggplant?
- Yes, I have.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.291
It looks just like this.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.583
Dudes! What is wrong with you two?

12:07.291 --> 12:08.917
We're dusty lavender, sir.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.125
Okay, purple it is.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.291
Rules are simple.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.291
If you get hit with another team's paint,
you're out.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.417
Team with the last man standing wins.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.333
Any questions?

12:18.875 --> 12:19.750
Excuse me?

12:19.834 --> 12:21.917
I thought there was going
to be a pre-battle mixer?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.625
So I made everybody some deviled eggs!

12:28.583 --> 12:29.959
Run!

12:48.625 --> 12:51.667
Great, the card's unopened.
She hasn't seen it yet.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.750
Susie, don't overbook
Dr. Bjorklund tomorrow.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.375
He's going to be tired
from his flight from Sweden.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.083
Whoa!

13:00.709 --> 13:01.625
Oh!

13:01.750 --> 13:03.709
I’m Dr. Bjorklund.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.417
Howdy doody to youdy, Judy.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.959
Oh, we weren't expecting you
till tomorrow.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.500
Oh, well, my cuckoo clock was fast.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.542
I hate it when your cuckoo
goes cuckoo, don't you too too?

13:17.625 --> 13:20.291
Oh, actually, it's a good thing
that you're early.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.208
We have a walk-in patient
who needs an immediate tooth extraction.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.875
I can't take the pain!

13:30.208 --> 13:31.709
But I’m so afraid!

13:32.792 --> 13:35.083
Oh, this is nice for an evil death lair.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.041
Oh.

13:42.583 --> 13:44.500
Uh, okay.

13:44.917 --> 13:48.000
Looks like I have no choice
but to take a little look at your tooth.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.291
Um, does this one hurt?

13:54.417 --> 13:55.917
What about this one?

13:57.834 --> 13:59.125
How about...

14:02.458 --> 14:03.834
I think we found it.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.041
Wha-- Jack just shot him.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.250
He looked him right in the eye
and he shot him!

15:07.333 --> 15:08.625
Who does that?

15:11.875 --> 15:13.291
I’m hyperventilating.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.709
I can't die now.
I’ve never even kissed a girl!

15:16.166 --> 15:17.792
You've never even held hands with a girl.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.208
You've never even talked to a girl.

15:19.291 --> 15:20.875
Look, I have a lot of things
to do with girls!

15:20.959 --> 15:23.625
Look, Jack's right, man.
We're not cut out for this.

15:23.709 --> 15:25.875
What are we going to do, Milton?
Didn't you learn anything

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
from those battle-strategy books
you were reading?

15:28.959 --> 15:30.000
Yes.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.750
And I know exactly what we're going to do.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.834
I surrender. Please don't hurt me.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.375
Okey dokey.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.583
We're going to take out that
naughty tooth lickety-split.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.083
Here's a syringe
filled with numbing agent.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.000
- Thank you very much, Holly--
-

16:05.500 --> 16:07.709
Um, maybe you'd like to put
some cotton in his mouth

16:07.792 --> 16:08.917
with these tongs?

16:16.959 --> 16:17.875
Oh.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.041
Suction, doctor?

16:23.125 --> 16:24.208
Ah.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.959
Well, now that I’ve sucked
your boogers, we can proceed.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.875
That's a big old oopsy-doopsy!

16:52.125 --> 16:53.959
Doctor, do you need some help?

16:55.959 --> 16:57.917
No, nothing to worry about.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.917
I think I was quick enough
to get it out before the numbing agent...

17:01.000 --> 17:03.875
Rudy!

17:03.959 --> 17:06.166
No no, I’m Dr. Bjorklund, I...

17:06.250 --> 17:07.917
My mask came off, didn't it?

17:10.709 --> 17:12.875
Bart, what are you doing here?

17:12.959 --> 17:14.959
I was coming to see you
when I saw these flowers outside

17:15.041 --> 17:17.792
with a love letter
attached for you, from Rudy.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.125
Now who's Rudy?

17:19.208 --> 17:22.083
Oh, that's Rudy.
You met him the other day.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.291
Oh, I’m sorry.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.250
I’m really not good with names.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.959
Now I remember. I’m gonna crush you!

17:36.458 --> 17:38.542
Now stand up and fight me like a man.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.333
Oh!

17:46.917 --> 17:48.375
My tooth came out!

17:48.458 --> 17:50.750
I feel no pain! Thank you!

17:50.834 --> 17:53.709
Oh, you should become a dentist, Mr. Bart!

17:53.792 --> 17:56.083
You'd be much better at that
than at football!

17:56.166 --> 17:57.917
You are awful!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.500
-
- Oh!

18:04.709 --> 18:06.250
Throw down your weapon.

18:07.041 --> 18:08.500
Where's the rest of your team?

18:08.583 --> 18:10.125
Jerry panicked and climbed out the window

18:10.208 --> 18:12.625
of the men's room.
It's just me and Sydney.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.834
Sydney, now!

18:41.250 --> 18:43.417
Surrender, Jack! It's over.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.417
He's right.
We've got you right where we...

18:46.667 --> 18:47.583
Ow!

18:47.667 --> 18:49.458
Not cool, dude. I’m not wearing a cup.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.959
It's just the two of us, Jack.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.709
Get ready to eat paint.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.250
Sounds like you're out of paint.

19:10.291 --> 19:11.750
You're smart, Milton.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.667
But you didn't think of everything.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.333
Actually, I did.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.542
Purple paint?

19:26.250 --> 19:28.542
That's not purple, punk.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.917
That's dusty lavender.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.625
- We did it!
- Whoo!

19:41.709 --> 19:44.750
The winner of this year's
commando battle is...

19:44.834 --> 19:47.166
The Wasabi warriors!

19:52.625 --> 19:56.000
Wow. You guys
really pulled this thing off.

19:56.083 --> 19:58.458
I, I’m sorry I underestimated you.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.750
Yes, you did.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.542
I never should have bailed on you.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.750
Permission to be
on your team next year, sir?

20:05.834 --> 20:07.875
Permission granted.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.125
Company fall in!

20:12.208 --> 20:14.375

20:48.583 --> 20:50.542
till next year's competition!

20:50.875 --> 20:52.667
Uh, how did I get here?

20:52.750 --> 20:54.750
I had a dream that I was
picked up in a shopping cart

20:54.834 --> 20:57.375
by a baboon and a freckled stork!

21:02.125 --> 21:05.750
Get down and give us 50, maggot!

21:08.542 --> 21:10.208
I’m not giving you 50.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.792
I’m not giving you one.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.125
Here's what's gonna happen.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.291
I am getting in this shopping cart

21:17.375 --> 21:20.667
and you two are going to take me home,
and I’m going back to bed!

21:20.750 --> 21:22.041
Is that clear?

21:23.208 --> 21:24.667
Very clear!

21:27.250 --> 21:28.500
Maggot.

21:56.834 --> 21:57.875
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.750 --> 22:02.709
<i>Yes!</i>
