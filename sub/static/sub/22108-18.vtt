Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"As I Walk Through
the Alley of the Shadow of Ramps"</font>

00:21.579 --> 00:23.626
Nothing like a game
of bike ride trash toss.

00:23.766 --> 00:24.984
Sport of kings.

00:25.061 --> 00:26.912
It's like Quidditch,
if Harry Potter's life

00:26.989 --> 00:28.379
took a really sad turn.

00:28.456 --> 00:30.010
Taco wrapper off the back lid.

00:30.087 --> 00:31.433
- Nice, T.
- Gene,

00:31.501 --> 00:33.376
I'm loving the new bike basket.

00:33.477 --> 00:35.120
You mean
this sweet handlebar candy?

00:35.188 --> 00:36.948
Why should girls have
all the fun?

00:37.016 --> 00:38.948
This summer's all
about boy baskets.

00:39.016 --> 00:40.022
You're a pioneer.

00:40.099 --> 00:41.694
Now watch me
sink these moldy buns

00:41.771 --> 00:43.196
from out in three-point land.

00:43.430 --> 00:44.476
Geez!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.527
Hi, I'm Alice,
your new neighbor.

00:46.595 --> 00:47.979
Could you move, please?

00:48.056 --> 00:50.433
- Nice to meet you, too, Alice.
- We'll move.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.205
We just have to deal
with this pile of garbage.

00:52.282 --> 00:53.712
My name is Gene.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.181
Could you speed it up a smidgen?

00:56.298 --> 00:58.235
Sorry, we're working at
full smidgen.

00:58.313 --> 01:00.713
Uh, try doing it like you
were strong, healthy children.

01:00.790 --> 01:01.977
What's the racket?

01:02.071 --> 01:04.501
Oh, you guys are playing
bike ride trash toss?

01:04.578 --> 01:07.338
- We were.
- How's the notary business, Mr. Huggins?

01:07.415 --> 01:09.610
Well, you know what they
say about being a notary.

01:09.679 --> 01:11.266
- What?
- Nothing. Nobody ever

01:11.342 --> 01:12.558
says anything about it.

01:12.923 --> 01:15.220
Hello? Did everyone
forget about me?

01:15.306 --> 01:16.981
I did. Sorry.

01:17.071 --> 01:18.745
When Hairy met Smoothie

01:18.813 --> 01:20.326
Smoothies and Hair Removal."

01:20.394 --> 01:22.751
So, you guys remove
hair from the smoothies?

01:22.884 --> 01:24.290
Ugh. This question again.

01:24.399 --> 01:25.659
I don't have time for this.

01:25.727 --> 01:27.261
Lady, if you're in such a hurry,

01:27.338 --> 01:30.261
why not use the street,
like a normal person?

01:30.338 --> 01:32.200
Because if I drive that way,
I have to make a left

01:32.277 --> 01:34.535
into traffic and it takes
forever and it makes me cranky.

01:34.612 --> 01:36.813
This is you not cranky?
No thanky.

01:36.881 --> 01:39.644
But if I go this way,
it's easy, and I can get lost

01:39.712 --> 01:42.076
in my CD of New Age Celtic
pop, and begin my day.

01:42.212 --> 01:45.379
But I can't do that if
kids are blocking the alley.

01:45.465 --> 01:46.586
So...

01:46.654 --> 01:48.190
All done, drive through.

01:48.258 --> 01:50.418
Yeah. So sorry
to keep you waiting.

01:50.495 --> 01:52.671
Thank you, tricycle girl.

01:53.126 --> 01:55.876
You're welcome,
weird business truck lady.

01:55.954 --> 01:57.922
Starting my day now, bye.

01:58.063 --> 02:00.389
♪ Ancient fountains ♪

02:00.457 --> 02:02.497
- ♪ Ooh... ♪
- Yeah! Get that Enya in ya.

02:02.574 --> 02:04.460
What a piece of work.

02:04.528 --> 02:06.176
She's not gonna ruin
our fun, though, right?

02:06.244 --> 02:08.041
Bean can from downtown.

02:08.457 --> 02:10.701
Should've gone in.

02:10.989 --> 02:12.236
Bob's Burgers.

02:12.322 --> 02:14.921
Oh, hi. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, sweetie, hold on.

02:14.989 --> 02:16.772
Slow down,
you're talking crazy, honey.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.538
- Oh, is it your sister?
- Bob says hi.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.929
O-Okay, okay, just sit tight.

02:19.997 --> 02:21.567
- I'm coming over.
- What's wrong?

02:21.635 --> 02:23.903
It's Gayle's first day at
her new job at the art museum,

02:23.971 --> 02:25.934
- and she's gonna quit.
- That's her thing, right?

02:26.002 --> 02:28.291
She gets a job and threatens
to quit after one day.

02:28.359 --> 02:30.155
You know what?
You're right. Maybe this time,

02:30.223 --> 02:32.014
I should just let her
figure it out for herself.

02:32.106 --> 02:33.725
You're grabbing
your keys,

02:33.793 --> 02:35.233
and you're picking up
your purse.

02:35.301 --> 02:36.910
I got to go, I got to go.

02:38.991 --> 02:40.536
Gayle, sweetie,
I'm here.

02:40.604 --> 02:42.474
Oh, thank God.
Hold me up.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.575
I've been standing so long.

02:45.148 --> 02:46.811
Gayle, G-Gayle.

02:46.879 --> 02:49.406
I can't be a security guard,
Linda.

02:49.483 --> 02:51.139
Gayle, stand up.

02:51.207 --> 02:52.332
I can't feel my legs.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.379
Here, here, you're standing
up, you're standing.

02:54.447 --> 02:55.471
I got to quit, Linda.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.731
I'm not made for this.

02:56.799 --> 02:57.957
I'm not an athlete.

02:58.025 --> 02:59.846
Gayle, look at that guy.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.939
- Yeah?
- He's, like, a hundred years old.

03:02.012 --> 03:03.440
If he can do it, you could do it.

03:03.508 --> 03:04.996
I'll never be that good.

03:05.064 --> 03:08.038
Listen, you'll get used
to it. I stand all day.

03:08.106 --> 03:10.847
Now I've got the best calves
in the family, besides Gene.

03:10.915 --> 03:12.510
It's not just the standing,
Linda.

03:12.578 --> 03:15.434
I thought I was gonna
be a protector of art.

03:15.502 --> 03:18.923
Guarding it from art thieves,
and people who lick sculptures.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.384
People lick sculptures?

03:20.461 --> 03:22.392
Of course they do.
Grow up, Linda.

03:22.479 --> 03:24.874
Oh. I-I... What the hell
is wrong with this world?

03:24.942 --> 03:27.331
But look around. It's boring here.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.274
Gayle, give it another day.

03:29.419 --> 03:31.114
And if you still hate it
after that day,

03:31.191 --> 03:32.321
you give it another day.

03:32.389 --> 03:34.173
And you keep going like that.
Forever.

03:34.241 --> 03:36.681
- That's what working is.
- Linda, no!

03:36.749 --> 03:38.103
But it's not all bad.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.247
They pay you, and
you get to go home after

03:40.315 --> 03:41.939
and say,
"What a day," and drink.

03:42.007 --> 03:44.329
- That does sound nice.
- Thatta girl.

03:44.397 --> 03:46.931
- Now stand in the place where you work.
- Okay.

03:47.441 --> 03:48.899
And then, she just drove away.

03:48.971 --> 03:51.227
What's her problem?
She doesn't own the alley.

03:51.295 --> 03:54.407
Yeah, kids play in alleys,
right? I did.

03:54.475 --> 03:57.467
I was a real Alley Sally till
I met your father, settled down.

03:57.535 --> 03:59.264
I hate when people
cut through the alley.

03:59.342 --> 04:01.610
E-Except for that guy in
the Corvette. He's cool.

04:01.678 --> 04:04.070
I think we'd be friends
if we had the opportunity.

04:04.138 --> 04:05.931
She called me "tricycle girl."

04:06.001 --> 04:07.006
What's up with that?

04:07.076 --> 04:08.319
Jealous, probably.

04:08.387 --> 04:10.123
Yeah, probably. Hey, uh,

04:10.193 --> 04:12.222
speaking of your,
uh, big wheel...

04:12.299 --> 04:14.677
- Mean green machine.
-  Right, mean green machine.

04:14.774 --> 04:18.286
Maybe it's time for
another, um, you know.

04:18.355 --> 04:20.839
- What?
- Another go at the old two-wheeler?

04:20.922 --> 04:22.279
I could give you a lesson again.

04:22.347 --> 04:24.700
No offense, Dad, but the
last one didn't go so great.

04:25.045 --> 04:26.612
Louise, tell me when
you want me to let go.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.635
- Not yet.
- Okay, now. Let go now.

04:28.712 --> 04:30.350
I'm trying. Your hands
are on top of my hands.

04:30.418 --> 04:31.920
- Now, Dad!
- Louise, relax your grip.

04:32.019 --> 04:34.195
- Let go now!
- You're digging your nails in!

04:35.819 --> 04:37.577
Louise, honey, let me teach you.

04:37.654 --> 04:40.350
Your dad's nice, but uh,
you know, he's not so bright.

04:40.427 --> 04:42.619
Hey, I'm good at it. I-I taught Tina.

04:42.687 --> 04:43.674
- Ha!
- What?

04:43.760 --> 04:44.817
I taught Tina.

04:44.894 --> 04:46.552
I worked with her for a week.

04:46.629 --> 04:48.664
And you swooped in at the
end to give her her last push.

04:48.732 --> 04:50.120
I "swooped in"?

04:50.188 --> 04:52.152
- Like a pterodactyl.
- Hairy-dactyl.

04:52.220 --> 04:53.909
Hey, with me, the
proof is in the pudding.

04:53.977 --> 04:55.569
Don't forget, I taught Gene.

04:55.637 --> 04:56.857
AKA the pudding.

04:56.925 --> 04:58.202
Actually, I taught Gene.

04:58.270 --> 04:59.779
Mom kept running off
to answer the phone.

04:59.847 --> 05:01.852
That woman never says
no to a phone call.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.615
It was Ginger. She was
going through something.

05:04.683 --> 05:06.318
I'm not allowed to
say what, but it rhymes

05:06.386 --> 05:07.907
with "botched schmemorrhoid surgery."

05:07.984 --> 05:09.870
Hey, I helped teach Gene, too,
remember?

05:09.945 --> 05:10.617
I remember.

05:10.687 --> 05:12.750
- I remember the crying.
- The crying?

05:12.818 --> 05:15.203
Your dad usually cries
when he teaches bike riding.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.710
Well, yeah, because a beautiful
moment is about to happen.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.276
A kid's first ride.

05:20.344 --> 05:21.843
- Oh, boy.
- Here it comes.

05:21.911 --> 05:24.135
Guys, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here,

05:24.337 --> 05:25.795
but I could ride a bike.

05:25.919 --> 05:27.140
I choose not to.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.182
Three wheels are better
than two. It's math.

05:29.289 --> 05:31.556
Well, what do we do to
put off doing the dishes?

05:31.624 --> 05:33.639
- Parcheesi?
- Cheese party?

05:33.874 --> 05:35.542
Parcheesi cheese party.

05:35.612 --> 05:37.236
Wow, that actually sounds great.

05:37.313 --> 05:38.749
But, before that, Gene
and Tina and I were gonna

05:38.831 --> 05:40.608
do a thing real quick?
R-Remember?

05:40.889 --> 05:42.228
- Um, sure.
- Yes?

05:42.296 --> 05:44.788
Well, be quick. We got
your father all excited.

05:44.856 --> 05:46.231
I'll get the Parcheesi board.

05:46.319 --> 05:47.880
Uh, Lin,
you get the cheese board.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.544
W-Wait, let's switch.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.751
- Where are we going, Louise?
- And am I dressed for it?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.491
Is this a missed
scarf-ortunity?

05:54.559 --> 05:55.650
Remember our friend Alice?

05:55.805 --> 05:57.845
She parks right here,
so I'm thinking,

05:57.913 --> 06:00.096
we write something in the
dust on her back window.

06:00.173 --> 06:02.628
And by "we," I mean "you,"
'cause I can't reach.

06:02.705 --> 06:04.397
- What are we gonna write?
- Glad you asked.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.669
"If You Can Read This, You're
Behind A Stinky Turd Truck."

06:07.805 --> 06:08.896
- Huh.
- Oh.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.530
Yeah. Pretty good, right?

06:10.598 --> 06:12.219
It's kind of rough?

06:12.345 --> 06:14.850
- Why don't we, um, tweak it a little?
- Okay.

06:14.918 --> 06:16.910
"If you can read this,
you're behind

06:16.978 --> 06:18.756
"what might be a stinky turd truck.

06:18.824 --> 06:21.272
Anyway, have a nice day.
Smiley face, one love."

06:21.383 --> 06:23.404
- It's perfect.
- Good collab, guys.

06:23.472 --> 06:26.217
I got to meet some kids
who know more curse words.

06:26.327 --> 06:28.022
Louise, we're not gonna
start something

06:28.090 --> 06:29.624
when the lady comes through,
right?

06:29.703 --> 06:31.397
Nah. We've sent a message.

06:31.514 --> 06:32.842
A weird, wordy message.

06:32.910 --> 06:34.674
I'm glad "one love" stayed in.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.092
You guys were gunning for it.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.264
Look, here she comes.

06:37.332 --> 06:39.100
- I'm so nervous.
- Relax.

06:39.168 --> 06:40.398
She doesn't know we did it.

06:40.582 --> 06:42.374
I know what you kids did.

06:42.442 --> 06:44.405
- Uh-oh.
- Lady, drive on by,

06:44.473 --> 06:45.874
we don't know
what you're talking about.

06:45.942 --> 06:47.634
Yeah, you do, tricycle girl.

06:47.702 --> 06:50.324
Okay, enough
with the tricycle stuff.

06:50.392 --> 06:51.652
Why don't you want to
talk about it?

06:51.720 --> 06:54.512
Because you're
too old to be riding one?

06:55.782 --> 06:57.160
- Okay.
- Whoa.

06:57.228 --> 07:00.152
That's right,
I went there, with a child.

07:00.263 --> 07:02.492
And now, I'm so upset,
I don't even want this smoothie

07:02.569 --> 07:03.944
I worked so hard on.

07:05.078 --> 07:06.863
What the hell just happened?

07:06.939 --> 07:09.691
I didn't mean to do that,
but, let's call it a happy accident.

07:09.759 --> 07:11.505
This is an active alley.

07:11.573 --> 07:13.629
It is not for little kids on bikes.

07:14.092 --> 07:15.686
<i>♪ Whispering birds
on a tree stump... ♪</i>

07:15.781 --> 07:17.530
Still feel good about
the "one love," Gene?

07:17.607 --> 07:18.856
Yes, I do.

07:22.802 --> 07:26.004
Fire escape, huh?
Whatcha doing? Escaping fires?

07:26.072 --> 07:28.301
We have to hit back
at Alice, and hit hard.

07:28.377 --> 07:30.324
Because of what she said
about your green machine?

07:30.494 --> 07:32.965
This isn't about my green machine, T
ina.

07:33.033 --> 07:35.151
But we can all agree,
nine is not too old.

07:35.219 --> 07:36.320
It's single digits.

07:36.388 --> 07:38.678
It's a six upside down;
how is that too old?

07:38.746 --> 07:39.774
Sure, s-sure.

07:39.842 --> 07:41.813
This is about our
God-given alley access.

07:42.014 --> 07:44.310
Oh, and not getting
smoothie splashed on us.

07:44.378 --> 07:45.772
Subpar smoothie.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.808
Bananas and beets are not friends.

07:47.896 --> 07:49.568
But what can we do?
We're just three kids,

07:49.636 --> 07:51.239
and she's a mean woman
with a big truck.

07:51.356 --> 07:54.270
Right. But what if we
weren't just three kids?

07:54.348 --> 07:55.654
Come back in 20 years?

07:55.740 --> 07:57.516
I am loving this plan.

07:57.624 --> 07:58.904
Rudy, buddy.

07:58.972 --> 08:01.047
We're, uh, planning a
bike party in our alley.

08:01.122 --> 08:03.351
Do you still have those
ramps you built with your dad?

08:03.928 --> 08:05.756
Huh, smaller than
advertised, but not bad.

08:05.824 --> 08:07.935
Lot of good memories in
these ramps, huh, buddy?

08:08.022 --> 08:09.779
You and I, hammering away at them

08:09.865 --> 08:11.412
in the driveway of
my condo. - Mm-hmm.

08:11.585 --> 08:13.944
Always something fun
happening at Dad's, huh?

08:14.012 --> 08:16.646
- Right, son? Right, son?
- Ow. Don't do that.

08:16.728 --> 08:18.224
- We don't do that.
- Sorry, yeah. Sorry.

08:18.292 --> 08:20.102
So how many people
did you invite

08:20.170 --> 08:21.217
to this bike party, Louise?

08:21.285 --> 08:22.576
A few. Everyone.

08:22.644 --> 08:23.795
It doesn't matter.

08:23.863 --> 08:25.752
If you have ramps, kids will come.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.953
Yeah, not in my experience,
but okay.

08:28.484 --> 08:30.045
What's Louise doing in the alley?

08:30.113 --> 08:31.585
Setting up for a bike party.

08:31.653 --> 08:33.207
Huh. I didn't get invited.

08:33.277 --> 08:35.100
And I'm the two-wheel teaching master.

08:35.168 --> 08:36.822
What about me?
I'm a good teacher.

08:36.890 --> 08:37.998
I taught you all the difference

08:38.066 --> 08:40.063
between Dermot McDermott
and Dylan Mulroney.

08:40.131 --> 08:41.881
Dammit. Oh, ugh.

08:42.365 --> 08:43.583
Bob's Burgers.

08:43.652 --> 08:46.234
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Gayle. How's work?

08:46.343 --> 08:48.828
Terrible. So boring.
I got to quit.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.576
Gayle, any good protector of art

08:50.659 --> 08:52.779
knows the threats don't
always jump out at you.

08:52.847 --> 08:54.532
- I don't know.
- Look around, Gayle.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.432
- What do you see?
- A statue.

08:56.518 --> 08:58.654
Oh, wait, that's a lady.
She's wearing all white.

08:58.722 --> 09:00.117
- Oh.
- Oh, no, wait, it's a statue.

09:00.192 --> 09:01.503
- Oh, no, she moved.
- Oh.

09:01.571 --> 09:02.572
Do statues move?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.584
Gayle, Gayle, what else?
What else, honey?

09:04.748 --> 09:06.308
Well, there's a guy in the next gallery.

09:06.385 --> 09:08.660
He comes here every day and
stares at this one painting.

09:08.728 --> 09:09.882
Every day?

09:10.021 --> 09:11.751
Gayle, you think nothing happens there.

09:11.828 --> 09:13.248
You're wrong. That guy?

09:13.316 --> 09:16.107
He's, uh, casing the joint.
He wants that painting.

09:16.201 --> 09:18.146
- What?!
- What's he look like? Describe him.

09:18.245 --> 09:19.937
Good-looking,
but not too good-looking.

09:20.025 --> 09:21.583
Like the Planters Peanut.

09:21.651 --> 09:23.613
Sounds like he doesn't want
to draw attention to himself.

09:23.683 --> 09:25.404
He's that good. You got to watch him.

09:25.472 --> 09:27.768
You might just stop the
biggest art heist in history.

09:27.836 --> 09:29.423
You think so?

09:29.491 --> 09:31.416
I know so. Now, I'm gonna
check back in with you

09:31.484 --> 09:33.313
at the end of your shift.
I want a full report.

09:33.381 --> 09:34.969
Okay. Call me every ten minutes.

09:35.037 --> 09:37.746
No, at the end of your...
Oh, Gayle, Gayle, I got to go.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.677
You hear that? That's why I'm
the world's greatest sister.

09:40.745 --> 09:42.303
Oh, they all left.

09:42.486 --> 09:45.241
- Wow, Louise, nice turnout.
- I'm pretty happy with it.

09:45.364 --> 09:46.892
Well, I guess I got to go
back inside.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.548
I'm-I'm getting a little weepy

09:48.616 --> 09:50.125
just being around all these bikes.

09:50.193 --> 09:51.600
Yeah, go inside, Dad.

09:51.668 --> 09:53.335
That's not really the
vibe we're going for.

09:53.403 --> 09:55.357
Okay, I'd say
be careful on the ramps,

09:55.425 --> 09:57.412
but those are some very
small ramps.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.193
Yeah, don't let Rudy hear you say that.

09:59.375 --> 10:02.932
Here goes everything.

10:03.009 --> 10:04.804
They should serve a meal on that flight.

10:04.881 --> 10:06.601
So you call this thing a "boy basket"?

10:06.669 --> 10:08.664
Also known as a "man-sket."

10:08.781 --> 10:11.101
And Zeke, if you're thinking
about getting one, do it.

10:11.169 --> 10:13.283
I got my wax lips in here,
extra socks,

10:13.351 --> 10:16.163
a free yoga magazine
I found, prednisone.

10:16.231 --> 10:17.750
I could give my turtle a ride.

10:17.818 --> 10:18.891
You have a turtle?

10:18.959 --> 10:21.101
You've met Terry, like,
a thousand times, Zeke.

10:21.169 --> 10:22.223
Oh, Terry.

10:22.291 --> 10:23.704
Right, I met him.

10:23.854 --> 10:25.640
See that, Tina? That is a woman

10:25.835 --> 10:27.726
who's about to take a left
into traffic.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.242
Huh. Yeah, she's not even
trying to come down the alley.

10:30.310 --> 10:31.199
It's called defeat.

10:31.267 --> 10:33.496
And she wears it like
a splattered smoothie.

10:33.843 --> 10:35.179
- Po Po.
- Oh, crap.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.389
Hey, is everything
okay over there, Louise?

10:37.457 --> 10:39.461
Hang back, Rudy.
I'll handle this.

10:39.529 --> 10:40.617
Oh, boy...

10:40.804 --> 10:42.156
Having a bike party?

10:42.224 --> 10:44.414
Yeah, Officer, just some
wholesome summer fun.

10:44.482 --> 10:46.077
Well, uh,
we got an anonymous complaint

10:46.145 --> 10:48.167
from, uh, actually,
that lady right there,

10:48.276 --> 10:49.470
that you're blocking the alley.

10:49.538 --> 10:50.898
Yeah, we need you to disperse.

10:50.966 --> 10:52.223
We'll move. Right, Louise?

10:52.291 --> 10:53.586
'Cause the police are saying to.

10:53.744 --> 10:55.435
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right away.

10:55.503 --> 10:56.481
Ugh...

10:56.549 --> 10:57.520
This is gonna be hard to break

10:57.588 --> 10:58.675
this to the little guy.

10:58.743 --> 10:59.704
It meant so much to him.

10:59.772 --> 11:01.597
What little guy?
You're all little guys.

11:01.722 --> 11:04.801
That one. This is kind
of, um, a benefit for him.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.657
Oh, yeah,
I have a cousin like that.

11:07.725 --> 11:10.020
He's not asthmatic,
he's just like that.

11:10.153 --> 11:12.579
Yeah, we set up some
ramps, passed the hat.

11:12.648 --> 11:14.015
I wish we could do more.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.645
Can't you do it somewhere else?

11:15.713 --> 11:18.786
We could. It's just...
he likes the alley.

11:18.854 --> 11:22.151
It's more private here.
People don't, you know, stare at him.

11:22.219 --> 11:25.008
- What's going on, Louise?
- Ah... Oh, God.

11:25.076 --> 11:26.770
Rudy, buddy,
I've got some bad news.

11:26.844 --> 11:28.204
Hey, you know what?
Never mind that.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.176
We, uh, w-we'll block off the alley.

11:30.244 --> 11:31.833
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good luck, kid.

11:31.901 --> 11:35.169
Why are you saying good luck?
Why did he say, "Oh, God"?

11:35.237 --> 11:38.294
Hey, we're here for you, son,
the whole damn police force.

11:38.362 --> 11:39.483
Um... why?

11:39.626 --> 11:41.351
Ah... Look at that face.

11:41.419 --> 11:43.514
- And your shriveled-up little arms.
- Yeah.

11:43.582 --> 11:45.583
What's happening?
Should I be insulted?

11:45.651 --> 11:46.754
Can we still ride bikes?

11:46.822 --> 11:49.442
Of course you can,
just like a normal kid,

11:49.510 --> 11:50.961
just like a normal kid.

11:51.029 --> 11:54.156
Thanks for your help, officers.
You did a good thing today.

11:54.224 --> 11:56.582
- I'm a normal kid. I... He's...
- Yeah, yeah.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.434
-You're real normal, Rudy.
- Am I not, like, a normal kid?

11:58.502 --> 12:00.333
- Right, officers?-
- That's right.

12:00.408 --> 12:03.161
God, I'm so cranky!
Getting crankier!

12:03.229 --> 12:04.301
Check and mate.

12:04.369 --> 12:06.254
Yup. She's really having
trouble with that left.

12:06.337 --> 12:10.309
Mess with the Belchers and
you will be mildly inconvenienced.

12:11.685 --> 12:12.922
You kids are quiet tonight.

12:12.990 --> 12:14.985
I can actually hear
the show we're watching.

12:15.053 --> 12:17.021
It's called Mr. Robot,
but he's human?

12:17.089 --> 12:18.387
I don't get it.
Pass the nuts.

12:18.455 --> 12:20.865
Guys, this is a silence
that falls over

12:20.933 --> 12:22.415
a just and peaceful land.

12:22.483 --> 12:25.125
- Who's Justin Peaceful?
- I think he's a folk singer.

12:25.325 --> 12:26.507
Oh, must be Rudy.

12:26.575 --> 12:28.531
Him and his dad were gonna
come pick up the ramps.

12:28.599 --> 12:30.461
Thanks for holding on to 'em,
Louise.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.446
That's weird. I left them
right here by the back door.

12:33.531 --> 12:36.180
- Oh, crap.
- Wh-What? What, oh, crap?

12:36.285 --> 12:37.795
She took the ramps.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.754
What? We've been ramp-jacked?

12:39.822 --> 12:41.145
I knew we should've insured them.

12:41.213 --> 12:43.755
Who would do a thing like that?
Maybe rollerbladers.

12:43.823 --> 12:45.919
- Those guys are pretty tough.
- Someone else.

12:45.987 --> 12:49.849
Someone who just took a left
turn into a world of hurt.

12:49.991 --> 12:52.192
Oh, no.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.894
So, you wanted my ramps

12:56.962 --> 12:58.380
to get back at a lady
who was mean to you,

12:58.448 --> 13:01.077
- and now that lady has them?
- Maybe you shouldn't have

13:01.145 --> 13:02.341
left the ramps in the alley, Louise.

13:02.409 --> 13:04.921
Yeah, there's only five
things thieves are looking for:

13:05.366 --> 13:08.072
cash, jewelry, swords, velor and ramps.

13:08.149 --> 13:10.290
I didn't think about it,
okay? But don't worry, Rudy.

13:10.358 --> 13:12.454
We're gonna march over
and take what's yours.

13:12.576 --> 13:15.500
She doesn't have your ramps.
The garbage men took 'em.

13:15.568 --> 13:17.102
- What?
- I tried to stop 'em.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.463
I was calling, "Hey!
Don't take the ramps!

13:19.531 --> 13:20.500
Don't take the ramps!"

13:20.568 --> 13:22.063
But I had a toothbrush
in my mouth then,

13:22.131 --> 13:23.322
and it probably sounded like,

13:23.485 --> 13:24.993
"Mwah, mwah, moo, moo, moo, moo, mwah!"

13:25.087 --> 13:27.235
But I put the ramps over there.

13:27.338 --> 13:28.805
They were nowhere near the garbage.

13:28.873 --> 13:30.528
- Well, she moved 'em.
- What?

13:30.603 --> 13:32.231
That lady you guys are fighting with,

13:32.299 --> 13:33.920
she moved 'em
by the Dumpsters.

13:33.988 --> 13:35.980
Ugh. She must've known
they'd get taken.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.554
I didn't know
why she was moving 'em.

13:37.622 --> 13:40.229
I mean, she was laughing
like a crazy person saying,

13:40.297 --> 13:41.372
"That'll show 'em!"

13:41.449 --> 13:42.774
You know, maybe that
should've tipped me off.

13:42.842 --> 13:44.160
It's okay, Mr. Huggins.

13:44.228 --> 13:46.218
It's only partially your
fault, mostly her fault,

13:46.286 --> 13:47.625
and nobody else's fault.

13:47.693 --> 13:48.618
Well, I mean, you're the one

13:48.686 --> 13:49.852
who left the ramps out
here when there's...

13:49.920 --> 13:52.235
Rudy, I threw you a benefit.

13:53.008 --> 13:54.141
Bob's Burgers.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.047
Linda.
The eagle has landed.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.774
The hawk is in the hamper.

13:57.897 --> 13:59.633
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?

13:59.701 --> 14:01.990
- I got the bastard.
- You what?

14:02.066 --> 14:04.525
The art thief,
I got him in custody.

14:04.613 --> 14:05.807
Gayle, Gayle, where are you?

14:05.954 --> 14:07.408
The interrogation room.

14:07.476 --> 14:09.772
Wha? They have one of
those at the art museum?

14:09.936 --> 14:12.438
Mm-hmm. It's also
the employee bathroom.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.344
Oh, my God, Gayle,
don't do anything.

14:14.412 --> 14:16.290
I'm coming over there.
Don't do anything.

14:16.454 --> 14:17.629
Bob, if I'm not back soon,

14:17.697 --> 14:19.214
it's 'cause I'm on the lam with Gayle.

14:19.282 --> 14:21.258
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay, I got to go.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.086
Oh, God. Here she comes.

14:26.993 --> 14:29.250
Move, Little Trikey Me-No-Likey.

14:29.318 --> 14:32.469
Not until you pay back my friend
for his surprisingly safe ramps.

14:32.537 --> 14:33.704
Hi, I'm the friend.

14:33.772 --> 14:35.400
Pretty dangerous ramps,
actually. Pretty scary.

14:35.561 --> 14:37.258
I said move.

14:37.326 --> 14:39.208
Oh, I am not moving.

14:39.276 --> 14:41.651
I am gonna eat in this alley
and sleep in this alley,

14:41.719 --> 14:43.981
and you are never
driving through here again

14:44.049 --> 14:46.498
in your whole life, or at
least until school starts.

14:46.646 --> 14:47.989
Move. Honk.

14:48.057 --> 14:49.205
No. Honk.

14:49.273 --> 14:50.393
Do it. Honk.

14:50.461 --> 14:51.479
I won't. Honk!

14:51.547 --> 14:52.804
I mean it. Honk.

14:52.872 --> 14:54.334
I don't care! Honk!

14:54.626 --> 14:56.518
What a couple of honkies.

14:56.586 --> 14:58.236
I don't like this,
Louise. It's dangerous.

14:58.304 --> 15:00.863
- Tina, it's fine. Honk!
- Louise.

15:00.931 --> 15:02.093
Honk infinity.

15:02.161 --> 15:03.210
- She's good.
- What if she thinks

15:03.278 --> 15:04.572
she's in park, but she's not,

15:04.640 --> 15:06.056
and she takes her foot
off the brake and... Ah!

15:06.124 --> 15:07.999
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, Tina, come on!

15:08.206 --> 15:10.320
You kids aren't ruining my morning.

15:10.388 --> 15:12.853
♪ Moss and fog, moss and fog ♪

15:12.921 --> 15:14.569
- ♪ Moss and fog. ♪
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

15:14.646 --> 15:16.504
Are you frickin' kidding me?!

15:16.581 --> 15:18.725
Oh, whoa.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.459
Tina, put the pedal to the...

15:21.527 --> 15:23.749
However this thing works.
Go, just go.

15:28.484 --> 15:29.961
We got to catch up
with that truck.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.437
I got eyes on your
green machine.

15:31.553 --> 15:33.375
So far it's hanging in there.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.298
- Kind of.
- Whoa! Bikes can go so fast.

15:36.454 --> 15:38.054
I mean, how does it
even stay up?

15:38.135 --> 15:40.242
We should be wiping out all
over the street right now.

15:40.310 --> 15:42.007
Ahh! Okay, now you're
getting in my head.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.436
Let's not look at this
too closely.

15:43.512 --> 15:44.898
She's turning on Garden Street.

15:44.966 --> 15:46.265
She's heading towards downtown.

15:46.342 --> 15:47.914
Where the young professionals are.

15:47.982 --> 15:50.238
They love smoothies
and hair removal.

15:50.306 --> 15:51.250
Let's cut through that alley.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.418
But what if we run into a bunch
of kids who don't want us to?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.753
Whoa, irony, Right?

15:56.579 --> 15:58.641
Hold on. It's a tight squeeze.

15:58.718 --> 16:02.170
Guys! There's a board
against some trash up ahead.

16:02.247 --> 16:04.506
I think... I think I'm
gonna have to take it.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.582
Rudy, be care... Oh,
that's not very scary.

16:06.659 --> 16:09.137
Whoa!

16:09.280 --> 16:10.949
- Did you guys see that?
- See what?

16:11.055 --> 16:13.480
- It's okay. God saw.
- There she is!

16:13.635 --> 16:15.690
Faster, Tina!

16:16.175 --> 16:17.879
Gayle, it's Linda, let me in.

16:17.947 --> 16:19.439
We got him just in time.

16:19.507 --> 16:21.259
He was about to make a move.

16:21.331 --> 16:23.390
Oh, hi, hi.
How are you? You good?

16:23.569 --> 16:24.960
- What's your name, hon?
- Neil.

16:25.028 --> 16:27.206
Neil? It's nice to meet
you, Neil. I'm Linda.

16:27.281 --> 16:28.839
Are you the good cop
or something?

16:28.918 --> 16:31.465
Oh, my God.
Uh, Gayle, sweetie, he's innocent.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.934
You know that, right?

16:33.002 --> 16:34.644
- He is?
- Of course he is.

16:34.712 --> 16:37.152
I'm sorry I got you riled
up. I was trying to help.

16:37.220 --> 16:39.112
I didn't think you
were gonna kidnap a guy.

16:39.180 --> 16:41.969
You should always think
I'm gonna kidnap a guy.

16:42.037 --> 16:44.095
I know. You're right.
But, you know,

16:44.163 --> 16:45.840
now you got to put him
back where you found him.

16:45.908 --> 16:47.796
But he knows too much now.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.944
- We got to get rid of him.
- No, Gayle.

16:50.012 --> 16:51.191
- Stop.
- Okay, fine.

16:51.259 --> 16:52.528
Sorry, sir.

16:52.596 --> 16:53.684
We're really sorry.

16:53.752 --> 16:54.846
You're not mad, right?

16:54.914 --> 16:56.621
I'm just confused. I mean,

16:56.688 --> 16:58.240
I-I love this place.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.862
I love that painting.

17:00.057 --> 17:01.919
I-I would never hurt it
or steal it.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.508
No, of course not.

17:03.576 --> 17:05.704
What's so special about
that painting, anyway?

17:05.948 --> 17:08.785
It's just a bunch of lines
and colors and splotches.

17:08.912 --> 17:11.003
I'm an artist, so I
know the terminology.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.925
Oh, I-I guess you could
say it gives me some comfort

17:14.003 --> 17:15.816
ever since my wife died.

17:15.884 --> 17:17.738
Oh, aw.

17:17.806 --> 17:19.387
Did I say "wife"? I meant "cat."

17:19.454 --> 17:21.128
Oh, my God,
you poor thing.

17:21.253 --> 17:23.849
H-Hey, I think you two
should get some coffee.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.441
- Really?
- You do?

17:25.579 --> 17:27.160
Yeah, I do.

17:27.228 --> 17:29.066
A guy who says "wife"
but means "cat"?

17:29.181 --> 17:30.863
That's a guy you got
to get to know, Gayle.

17:30.931 --> 17:34.020
How about right now? Oh, I have a job.
Oh, I want to quit!

17:34.116 --> 17:35.934
Gayle, just meet him
at 5:00, for God's sake.

17:36.002 --> 17:37.356
Oh, it's okay, Gayle.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.402
Uh, I'll just hang around
until then.

17:39.470 --> 17:41.892
Oh. Maybe I can lean against you.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.852
Oh. You're really gonna lean, huh?

17:43.920 --> 17:46.570
Yeah, this'll work.
Let's go guard some art.

17:46.638 --> 17:47.846
There she is.

17:48.362 --> 17:49.519
You followed me?

17:49.587 --> 17:50.672
Yeah, we did.

17:50.740 --> 17:53.336
You dragged my green
machine all over town.

17:53.404 --> 17:55.225
I what? Oh, my God.

17:55.402 --> 17:57.093
That is not easy to look at.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.995
It's like something you
dance around at Burning Man.

18:00.173 --> 18:01.334
I didn't know it was there.

18:01.402 --> 18:02.556
Understandable.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.182
It's only a big chunk of plastic

18:04.250 --> 18:06.245
you dragged under your
truck for, like, two miles.

18:06.349 --> 18:07.907
I could have killed you.

18:08.023 --> 18:10.282
Oh. Huh. Well, I guess that's true.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.905
I like how upset you are.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.227
Keep that coming.

18:14.295 --> 18:16.453
- Okay, too much.
- I'm sorry.

18:16.630 --> 18:18.964
Things have been crazy.
I've been so on edge

18:19.032 --> 18:21.711
since I dumped my
savings into this truck.

18:21.995 --> 18:24.383
It seems like a can't-miss idea,
right?

18:24.491 --> 18:25.930
- Um, yeah, uh...
- Sure, sure.

18:25.998 --> 18:27.414
But business is bad.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.367
Business is very bad.

18:29.435 --> 18:30.711
Well, maybe
that's your problem?

18:30.779 --> 18:32.594
It makes me feel awful,
you know?

18:32.740 --> 18:34.469
That part of trying
something new

18:34.537 --> 18:35.925
when I just suck at it.

18:36.005 --> 18:37.562
What if I suck at it forever?

18:37.630 --> 18:38.792
I don't know. Give up?

18:38.860 --> 18:40.418
No, no, no.
It's okay, Alice.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.563
We've all been there.
Haven't we?

18:42.631 --> 18:44.389
Sorry, lady.
You're not gonna get me

18:44.457 --> 18:46.716
and my messed up green
machine to feel bad for you.

18:46.784 --> 18:48.367
I'm just saying,
we've all had that fear

18:48.435 --> 18:50.225
when you're trying something new

18:50.293 --> 18:51.301
that's kind of scary

18:51.369 --> 18:53.566
and you think you're never
gonna be able to do it, right?

18:53.636 --> 18:55.962
I did when I was switching
from boob to bottle.

18:56.031 --> 18:57.667
Hardest four years of my life.

18:57.735 --> 19:00.064
Okay, so we covered Gene.
And maybe someone else

19:00.142 --> 19:01.785
can relate in some way?

19:01.853 --> 19:04.112
- I don't like bats.
- Okay, that's totally off-topic.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.342
Sorry, I thought we were just
talking about scary stuff.

19:06.429 --> 19:08.784
Louise, what have you
been scared about lately?

19:08.900 --> 19:11.203
Something that's "wheel-y"
hard to start doing?

19:11.303 --> 19:14.352
- "Two-wheel-y" hard?
- I'm gonna also say bats.

19:14.428 --> 19:15.589
Nope, that's not
something you do.

19:15.657 --> 19:16.912
Uh, can I guess?

19:17.093 --> 19:18.821
Shut up, Alice. Sorry, sorry.

19:18.889 --> 19:21.381
All right, I get it.
I get it, Tina. Geez.

19:21.449 --> 19:22.503
Oh, good.

19:22.575 --> 19:24.472
And maybe you have a point.

19:24.557 --> 19:27.149
Alice, I can see how
you might not have been

19:27.281 --> 19:29.210
your best self during
our alley interactions.

19:29.278 --> 19:31.169
Thank you.
And I just want to say

19:31.237 --> 19:33.192
I also don't like bats.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.485
Hard thing to admit.
Respect.

19:35.644 --> 19:36.792
You know what?

19:36.860 --> 19:38.902
I am gonna stick with
this business.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.214
Ah, ha! Good one.
Oh, you're serious.

19:41.364 --> 19:42.839
I mean, good. Solid plan.

19:42.907 --> 19:45.816
And I want to pay you back
for the ramps and the trike...

19:45.939 --> 19:48.042
- Great.
- in store credit!

19:48.114 --> 19:50.035
- Would you prefer waxes or smoothies?
- Smoothies.

19:50.127 --> 19:51.660
- Smoothies.
- Smoothies. - Waxes!

19:52.079 --> 19:54.050
Sorry again a
bout your ramps, Rudy.

19:54.127 --> 19:55.042
It's okay.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.980
My dad and I will build
more ramps.

19:57.142 --> 19:59.144
From the ashes rise ramps.

19:59.336 --> 20:01.257
- More ramps.
- Huh.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.363
Is there something different
about Jimmy Jr. and Zeke?

20:03.453 --> 20:06.128
Check it out, Gene.
Our man-skets.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.567
How'd I ever get
by without one of these?

20:08.672 --> 20:11.450
Yeah!
Summer of the boy basket.

20:11.518 --> 20:13.581
And what about your green
machine, Louise? I mean,

20:13.669 --> 20:15.622
free smoothies take some of
the sting out of it, but...

20:15.690 --> 20:18.814
Yeah. Well, I've been thinking...

20:20.126 --> 20:22.337
Move back.
Everyone move back.

20:22.405 --> 20:23.868
We're back as far as we can go, 
Louise.

20:23.936 --> 20:25.871
Move back further.
Mom, no pictures.

20:25.939 --> 20:27.812
Right, right, right.
Mr. Huggins, you got this?

20:27.906 --> 20:28.644
I got it.

20:28.712 --> 20:30.740
Mom, who are you taking
to? What'd you just say?

20:30.808 --> 20:33.624
Nothing, nobody.
Just focus on the bike and smile.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.523
Here we go in five, four...

20:35.637 --> 20:37.605
- Dad, no crying!
- I'm sorry.

20:37.673 --> 20:39.663
Don't worry, Louise.
If your father screws this up,

20:39.751 --> 20:41.241
I'm ready to step in
and be the hero.

20:41.309 --> 20:42.472
For the record,
I totally paved the way

20:42.540 --> 20:43.298
for this whole thing to happen

20:43.366 --> 20:44.592
with my amazing speech earlier.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.751
But yeah, it's fine.

20:45.908 --> 20:47.666
Three, two, one...

20:47.746 --> 20:49.149
Oh!

20:49.258 --> 20:52.316
Pedal! Pedal! You're
becoming a woman, Louise!

20:52.389 --> 20:53.847
Okay, Dad, let go.

20:53.978 --> 20:55.551
