01:12.873 --> 01:13.874
Once upon a time,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.277
there was a handsome narrator.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.311
He opened a movie by telling

01:18.345 --> 01:20.548
the story of a jungle tribe,

01:20.581 --> 01:21.582
happy and carefree

01:21.615 --> 01:23.884
and generally idiotic.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.819
One day, a shaman predicted

01:25.853 --> 01:27.287
that their good times

01:27.320 --> 01:30.691
would soon come to a tragic end.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.894
But the shaman's intern butted in

01:33.927 --> 01:35.395
and announced that they would be saved

01:35.428 --> 01:39.166
by a deity named The Golden Dragon.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.734
The shaman freaked out

01:40.768 --> 01:42.703
and revoked his intern's course credit

01:42.736 --> 01:44.337
for contradicting him.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.306
But it was too late,

01:46.339 --> 01:49.176
the villagers had hope again

01:49.209 --> 01:50.644
and went back to their ridiculous

01:50.678 --> 01:52.312
dance routines.

01:52.345 --> 01:53.514
The name of The Golden Dragon

01:53.547 --> 01:56.517
was passed down
from generation to generation

01:56.550 --> 01:58.752
to, well, until it was forgotten,

01:58.786 --> 01:59.920
but then it is remembered again

01:59.953 --> 02:01.822
and became legend,

02:01.855 --> 02:06.794
The Legend of The Golden Dragon,

02:06.827 --> 02:08.762
and the handsome narrator.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.602
Move, move, move.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.736
Pick it up, Wally.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.871
I've seen noses
that run faster than you.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.140
Yeah, Wally.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.418
Come on, let's go team, onward.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.954
Oh, shake a leg, lamb chop,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.189
or are you waiting for me
to make applesauce?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.224
Shake a leg?

02:37.257 --> 02:38.391
He's quivering all over.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.392
No, I'm not quivering,

02:39.426 --> 02:40.594
it's just chilly out here.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.329
- Aren't you guys chilly?
- Go.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.496
Careful of the loose ones.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.198
Oh, which ones are the loose ones?

02:45.232 --> 02:46.233
All of them.

02:48.969 --> 02:49.803
Hop those legs, Wally.

02:49.837 --> 02:50.738
Don't look down.

02:50.771 --> 02:54.575
Nobody's stupid enough
to look down... oh.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.408
Faster.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.782
Need a little lift there, buddy?

03:01.815 --> 03:02.783
Oh, that's it.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.451
I just can't make it.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.319
Go on, save yourselves.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.288
Oh, wait for me.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.436
Faster! Move, team,
go, go, go, go, go!

03:27.775 --> 03:28.976
Oh, yeah.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.544
Yeah. Perfect.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.379
Perfect? This is perfect?

03:32.412 --> 03:33.947
What's next? A group
checking the dentist?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.552
Oh, my horoscope was right.

03:38.586 --> 03:42.355
I should've stayed under the bed today!

03:42.389 --> 03:43.924
Whoa.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.459
Rock and roll, woo.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.029
Oh, this is not good,

03:49.062 --> 03:51.464
not good, oh.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.334
I can't fly. Whoa.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.469
Wally, no.
What are you doing, Wally?

03:56.504 --> 03:58.405
What are you... Oh, come on,
Wally, give me a break.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.507
No.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.712
Oh, Wally, what are you doing up there?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.680
Get off my head.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.583
Huh?

04:09.617 --> 04:10.684
What? What is it?

04:10.718 --> 04:11.785
What's going on?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.687
Oh, why did I have to ask?

04:13.721 --> 04:14.688
On your right.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.889
Oh.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.558
Are you kidding?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.593
No.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.967
Oh, Wally.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.303
- What was that, Wally?
- We are dead.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.339
- When I get my hooves on you...
- Now, now, everybody.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.074
Keep your hooves to yourselves.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.743
I need my computer back.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.744
This isn't fair.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.345
I have another life left.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.080
But you're wrong,
you only have one life,

04:40.113 --> 04:41.982
and you shouldn't waste it
playing video games.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.518
Now, please, Krash,
I'm already behind schedule.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.519
Now, we have to stop

04:45.553 --> 04:46.620
because Wally's afraid

04:46.654 --> 04:48.856
of a stupid 8-bit toad?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.658
But I wasn't scared.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.692
I was surprised

04:51.725 --> 04:52.726
by how scary it was.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.030
Whoa.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.431
Oh, here we go, girl,

04:58.465 --> 04:59.432
hop, hop,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.869
very good, good girl.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.104
Hop, hop.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.639
Great. Not now.

05:05.673 --> 05:06.640
Not yet.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.642
Oh, ow.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.778
Well...

05:20.954 --> 05:22.890
Holy carrot.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.825
Ah, our master pilot,

05:24.858 --> 05:27.060
is this beauty ready for our big flight

05:27.094 --> 05:28.395
overseas tomorrow?

05:28.428 --> 05:30.998
It's an auspicious day.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.101
Yeah, everything's ship shape,

05:34.134 --> 05:36.369
except the couple sticky thing flips,

05:36.403 --> 05:37.370
nothing a few whacks

05:37.404 --> 05:39.740
with a frying pan can't fix.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.542
- You got a frying pan?
- Frying pan?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.711
I might have a fondue pot somewhere.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.412
Aah, close enough.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.882
Hey, guys, open hatch, 12:00.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.084
It looks like today won't be
a complete waste after all, huh?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.753
Yeah, what are we waiting for?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.622
Waiting for?
We all just saw that thing

05:54.655 --> 05:56.557
crash out of the sky, and catch fire,

05:56.590 --> 05:58.058
like a roman candle.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.392
This is ridiculous.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.327
Tell them, Rosa.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.963
- Wally, hurry up...
- Rosa?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.998
Rosa? Shh.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
Uh, who?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.036
Me?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.504
Be right there.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.673
No, I won't.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.574
Oh, forget it.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.043
Stay on the ground like a wiggly worm.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.650
Let's get airborne.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.721
Have a good test flight.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.490
Ha-ha, they're all aboard,
baby cakes.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.961
Clear the decks, chocks away.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.030
Increase the power.
Turbines, for speed.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.867
What is this blinking light?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.635
Ah, that's better.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.845
Oh, no.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.881
Wally? Hi, there.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.550
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.519
The big conference is tomorrow,

06:58.552 --> 06:59.520
and I haven't practiced

06:59.553 --> 07:00.554
my speech yet.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.623
Imagine, the scientific luminary

07:02.656 --> 07:04.091
like Dokko unprepared.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.493
I could use your help
if you have the time.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.128
Oh.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.932
Time?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.567
I've got nothing but time,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.969
because I'm Wally.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.874
What did they want from me?

07:20.908 --> 07:23.076
I'm not a professional gamer

07:23.110 --> 07:26.914
or a test pilot.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.481
Hmm?

07:31.819 --> 07:34.487
Oh, klutz.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.756
What about that loop-the-loop?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.725
I thought my guts were gonna
fly out of my ears.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.793
Yeah, there was so much
blood in my brain,

07:39.827 --> 07:41.562
I thought my eyes were gonna pop out.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.030
- So, Rosa...
- Uh-huh?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.131
Oh.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.835
I could never be as athletic as Krash,

07:47.868 --> 07:50.203
- or as strong as Berry.
- Hey.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.939
- Oh, hey, Berry.
- So what's Dokko

07:51.972 --> 07:53.807
dreamed up for us this time,
do you think?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.909
He said it was
the invention of the century.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.645
Of course, he did.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.648
And I'm going to help him demonstrate

08:00.681 --> 08:02.950
the latest invention of the century.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.952
Oh, you're in for a good time.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.557
Oh, terrific.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.091
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:11.124 --> 08:12.926
the greatest mind of our time,

08:12.960 --> 08:16.830
the moose who put
the I in science, Dokko.

08:16.864 --> 08:17.865
Ta-da.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.100
Do we clap?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.969
- Nah.
- In preparation for our big

08:22.002 --> 08:24.071
flight to the FRED conference,

08:24.104 --> 08:26.239
the Festival of Ranting
Engineering Dweebs,

08:26.273 --> 08:27.274
welcome to this...

08:27.307 --> 08:28.609
Sorry, I'm late.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.810
That fiber will sneak up

08:29.843 --> 08:30.811
on you like a ninja.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.845
You didn't miss anything,

08:31.879 --> 08:32.846
just the greatest invention

08:32.880 --> 08:35.115
- of all time again.
- Ahem.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.216
And now, at last,

08:36.249 --> 08:38.051
a revolution in self-help,

08:38.085 --> 08:40.253
a miracle of modern technology.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.524
The wonderful, Improve-riser...

08:48.261 --> 08:50.631
This is where you applaud madly.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.865
Huh?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.100
Uh-huh.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.903
Improve-riser?

08:57.605 --> 09:00.140
And just what
is this improve-rising?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.810
Only total co-use of cognitive

09:02.843 --> 09:05.278
and motor skills.

09:08.816 --> 09:09.817
Or in layman's terms,

09:09.850 --> 09:13.220
borrowing someone's talents

09:13.253 --> 09:18.125
by means of this slick
and fashionable headgear.

09:18.158 --> 09:18.926
For example,

09:18.959 --> 09:21.128
some of us are excellent dancers,

09:21.161 --> 09:22.863
or can play guitar,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.832
or run very fast.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.900
Now, by simply wearing this helmet,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.236
you can trade any ability

09:29.269 --> 09:31.839
with anyone else.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.840
- I can learn...
- Oh, yes.

09:32.873 --> 09:33.841
Dokko?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.242
Could Chiko weed my tulip garden?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.810
Just as good as I can?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.680
Hey, wait a minute.

09:40.881 --> 09:41.882
Allow me to demonstrate

09:41.915 --> 09:44.284
how the Improve-riser operates.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.786
Let's observe,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.855
if I could just be joined
by my strapping,

09:47.888 --> 09:50.157
and athletic,
and daring young assistant,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.159
right there.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.160
- What?
- He's just mad.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.628
- No way.
- Oh.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.664
- Me?
- Sorry, I meant Krash,

09:56.697 --> 09:57.965
obviously.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.900
That's me.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.637
Go, Krash!

10:04.905 --> 10:06.373
All right.
Now, who out there

10:06.406 --> 10:07.875
would like to jump like Krash?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.910
Give it a try.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.648
- Come on, Olga, go for it.
- Come on, you can do it.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.017
Right, it's time to make history.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.418
Here's how it works,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.888
with the helmet securely
on the subject's head,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.190
like so, the abilities are transferred

10:23.223 --> 10:25.192
from the donor all the way across

10:25.225 --> 10:28.028
to the lucky recipient.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.663
With only a push

10:29.697 --> 10:30.764
of a button.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.334
Oh. Oh!

10:40.273 --> 10:41.274
How are you feeling?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.376
Oh, fidgety.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.216
Go.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.020
Whoa, whoa.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.356
Taking a roll.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.725
Try to catch me.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.992
You can't catch me.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.129
I'm truly a genius, yes, truly.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.330
And if you want to switch over

11:03.363 --> 11:04.297
to your original abilities,

11:04.331 --> 11:06.199
just press the button thing
one more time,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.001
no problem.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.704
Everything will go
straight back to normal.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.739
Look at it.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.150
Yeah, science.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.918
- Outstanding.
- Just amazing.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.089
Sizzling...

11:29.122 --> 11:31.058
Just incredible.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.293
Enough of the sheepish, sheep.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.762
Tomorrow,

11:34.795 --> 11:35.863
the whole world meets

11:35.896 --> 11:39.066
a brave, new Wally.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.259
Nice...

12:06.293 --> 12:08.896
and gentle.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.330
Nice... huh?

12:10.363 --> 12:11.965
I'm so sorry.
Chocks away.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.333
* Chocks away *

12:13.366 --> 12:18.371
* < Sleep today >
< in a hammock you' ll stay > *

12:26.313 --> 12:29.282
Okay.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.918
There.

12:39.827 --> 12:40.828
Yes.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.031
Ah, okay.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.377
I'm sure Krash will be more than happy

12:57.410 --> 12:59.012
to lend me a little bravery,

12:59.046 --> 13:02.149
yeah, just a bit here,
he'll never miss it.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.818
Now, while I'm here, hmm.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.919
Oh, of course,

13:05.953 --> 13:08.889
it wouldn't hurt to get a smidge
of Berry's strength

13:08.922 --> 13:10.858
and a little of Dokko's smarts,

13:10.891 --> 13:13.226
Carlin's talent and Olga's...

13:13.260 --> 13:14.928
Huh?

13:14.962 --> 13:18.465
What?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.100
Don't look at me like that.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.836
Like you wouldn't do exactly
the same thing.

13:22.870 --> 13:23.837
Okay.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.005
Now, it's time,

13:25.038 --> 13:27.040
good-bye, old Wally.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.408
Get ready, world,

13:28.441 --> 13:32.445
for the new upgraded Wally.

13:37.585 --> 13:39.587
Whoa.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.490
Whoa.

13:43.524 --> 13:45.325
Oh.

13:49.630 --> 13:53.066
That can't be good.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.568
Oh, no, you bug,

13:54.602 --> 13:56.870
get out of here.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.221
What happened?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.523
Where am I?

14:15.556 --> 14:18.125
Oh, there I am.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.960
Wait, what?

14:21.995 --> 14:24.131
How can I be over there

14:24.164 --> 14:27.100
when I'm right over here?

14:28.135 --> 14:30.137
Oh, no.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.243
Oh, crud, oh, crud,

14:36.276 --> 14:37.410
oh, crud!

14:37.444 --> 14:39.279
Wait a minute.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.115
That thing's not
an Improve-riser,

14:42.149 --> 14:44.585
it's a switcheriser.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.188
All right, Wally, just don't panic,

14:48.221 --> 14:50.023
you can change it back.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.525
Whoa.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.196
I'll put things back
to the way they were,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.699
that's all, just back
to the way they were.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.367
Okay, guy.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.602
Just hang on.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.470
Oh. Just.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.976
How am I supposed to move
around on these things?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.678
Hey, you,

15:12.079 --> 15:14.582
we need to change back, right now.

15:14.615 --> 15:18.085
Stop eating carrots and listen to me.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.721
You don't even like carrots!

15:20.754 --> 15:21.955
Wait.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.190
No, stop.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.692
Stop, right there,

15:24.725 --> 15:26.159
right now.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.228
Listen, mister, do not get me angry.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.531
There, good, good,

15:30.564 --> 15:32.465
just like that.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.301
Great, it'll be all be over in a minute.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.302
We're just going to press

15:35.335 --> 15:36.937
one incy button and... oh.

15:39.507 --> 15:40.741
No, no, no, no, no.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.244
Are you freaking kidding me?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.420
Coffee.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.455
I'll have a carrot juice on the rocks.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.557
What's four letters

15:56.590 --> 15:58.291
meaning ancient battle axe?

15:58.325 --> 15:59.326
What?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.529
Olga, that's an easy one.

16:01.562 --> 16:03.063
Snacks.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.497
Too bad Wally's not here.

16:04.532 --> 16:05.666
- Tea.
- You're sure you tried...

16:05.699 --> 16:06.734
Yeah.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.102
Yeah, I almost beat his doors out.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.638
How could he miss this soothing flight

16:10.671 --> 16:12.039
in the clouds?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.682
Time to flipping the flippers.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.717
I wonder what this one does.

16:23.751 --> 16:26.086
Pin, let me know when you get tired.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.689
I can take over for you, no problem.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.758
< Fräuleins > don't fly.

16:30.791 --> 16:32.392
That's hysterical.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.393
What's next?

16:33.426 --> 16:34.728
A sandwich for a president?

16:34.762 --> 16:35.729
Coffee, please.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.069
Oh.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.773
Oh, no, no.

16:45.806 --> 16:48.375
I'm never going outside again!

17:04.223 --> 17:05.192
What gives,

17:05.224 --> 17:06.425
you hunk of < gerümpel >,

17:06.459 --> 17:08.596
you stupid!

17:08.628 --> 17:11.231
Nein, nein, nein, nein!

17:13.733 --> 17:15.769
Four letters, a call for aide.

17:15.803 --> 17:16.770
Tea.

17:16.804 --> 17:17.771
Thanks.

17:17.805 --> 17:20.107
Coffee.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.441
* My rock and roll *

17:21.473 --> 17:23.410
* Rock and roll *

17:23.443 --> 17:25.345
* Sex-bomb, sex bomb *

17:25.377 --> 17:27.480
* You're a sex bomb *

17:27.515 --> 17:29.116
* You can give it to me *

17:29.149 --> 17:31.852
* When I need to come along... *

17:31.885 --> 17:33.621
* My rock and roll *

17:33.654 --> 17:37.658
* Rock and roll *

17:41.294 --> 17:45.265
You can stop... and climb again.

17:48.569 --> 17:49.670
Huh?

17:49.703 --> 17:51.772
Pin, I need your help.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.375
Who says this?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.410
Whoa.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.280
No.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.449
Not that lever, not that lever.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.184
Not that lever.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.487
Oh, no.

18:13.861 --> 18:15.596
Who turned off the gravity?

18:15.629 --> 18:17.665
I don't know, but it wasn't me.

18:17.698 --> 18:21.301
Well, somebody better turn it back on.

18:22.503 --> 18:23.303
Oh, that's good.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.806
But not quite, mate.
Everyone, out.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.207
Go. Go. Go.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.809
My Improve-riser.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.912
I forgot to lock my tray table.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.815
Come on, slow pokes,
no time to lollygag.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.750
Well, at least
this beats serving drinks.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.385
Hey, heads up.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.420
So what do I now...?

18:41.755 --> 18:43.691
Alright, who doesn't
have a parachute yet?

18:43.724 --> 18:45.425
- Speak up.
- I'm speaking up.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.828
- Don't leave me here.
- Geronimo.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.430
Berry, wait for me.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.666
No. Don't even think about it.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.402
Berry, watch out.

19:11.619 --> 19:14.688
This is awesome.

19:14.722 --> 19:16.557
- This is terrifying.
- Where is it?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.225
Hey.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.562
This isn't my parachute.

19:23.564 --> 19:24.532
Huh?

19:24.565 --> 19:26.767
Berry.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.637
What the...?

19:32.573 --> 19:34.207
I can't steer this thing.

19:35.943 --> 19:37.678
I can't steer this thing.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.880
Hit the brakes.

19:42.816 --> 19:43.951
I'm going to hork.

19:43.984 --> 19:45.753
Don't you dare.

19:46.954 --> 19:48.756
The red cord.
Where is the red cord?

19:48.789 --> 19:51.358
Oh, here.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.862
That wasn't so...

20:00.734 --> 20:03.604
Chocks away.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.009
I haven't had that much fun

20:09.042 --> 20:11.612
since I got stuck
in that buttered shirt.

20:11.645 --> 20:15.649
Krash, never let me fly again.

20:15.683 --> 20:17.618
Has anyone seen my glasses?

20:17.651 --> 20:18.786
Oh, boy.

20:18.819 --> 20:21.321
Have you seen my hat?
Anybody?

20:21.354 --> 20:24.424
The Improve-riser,
did it survive?

20:24.457 --> 20:25.626
- Anyone?
- Oh, stop crying.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.661
I want to get off.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.499
My body.

20:32.533 --> 20:35.969
Guys, has anybody seen my body around?

20:36.003 --> 20:37.771
I can't find it anywhere.

20:37.805 --> 20:40.508
Where's my hat?

20:40.541 --> 20:41.609
I must be seeing things.

20:41.642 --> 20:42.843
What a concussion.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.912
I am not a concussion.

20:44.945 --> 20:48.448
- Ew, it's a gross worm.
- I'm not gross...

20:48.481 --> 20:50.518
There's my hat, you greedy worm.

20:50.551 --> 20:52.786
Oh, here's what we do with these.

20:55.723 --> 20:57.658
Stop it.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.629
I am not a worm,

21:01.662 --> 21:04.732
I'm Wally.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.768
What the... this stuff ought to
have a warning label on it,

21:07.801 --> 21:09.369
it may cause talking moth things.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.539
I'm not a moth, I'm a caterpillar...

21:11.572 --> 21:13.807
No, I'm not a caterpillar,
it's me, Wally.

21:13.841 --> 21:15.876
And I just want to find

21:15.909 --> 21:17.911
my body.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.127
Okay, boys.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.362
We got to somehow find that plane

22:09.396 --> 22:11.364
and find a way off this crazy island.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.666
And also find a body,

22:12.700 --> 22:15.035
thanks to Edison with antlers over here.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.070
Yes, it's remarkable.

22:17.104 --> 22:18.572
Truly, it is.

22:18.606 --> 22:20.808
Not only does the thing
spot the talents,

22:20.841 --> 22:23.811
it's actually switching the bodies.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.078
- Totally.
- Wally, what possessed you

22:25.112 --> 22:26.880
to do this?
You could have died.

22:26.914 --> 22:28.448
That might have been better.

22:28.481 --> 22:32.953
Look at all of those pesky
little feet, slimy skin.

22:32.986 --> 22:35.155
I can't even look at you.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.524
Thanks.

22:36.557 --> 22:38.091
Don't be so pessimistic.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.529
Surprises are a part
of the scientific process.

22:41.562 --> 22:43.964
Science can do anything
when it puts its mind to it.

22:43.997 --> 22:45.899
Wally, we picked you some food.

22:45.933 --> 22:47.668
Let them dry first.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.102
You're too kind.

22:49.136 --> 22:51.972
Hey, come on, go ahead and try it.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.175
Does he like it?

22:55.208 --> 22:57.144
Oh, it's just great.

22:57.177 --> 22:58.111
All right.

22:58.145 --> 23:00.180
We'll bring you more later,
there's lots.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.515
He didn't die.

23:01.549 --> 23:02.750
Looks like I lost the bet,

23:02.783 --> 23:04.552
they're not poisonous.

23:05.986 --> 23:07.555
- Lake time.
- Finally.

23:07.588 --> 23:09.590
Great. Time to stretch.

23:09.623 --> 23:12.726
And you, don't you dare change yourself

23:12.760 --> 23:15.629
into something else...
or else!

23:15.663 --> 23:17.998
Huh? Those are strange animal tracks.

23:18.031 --> 23:20.100
What kind of animal has tires for feet?

23:20.133 --> 23:21.602
Hmm.

23:21.635 --> 23:23.436
Wally.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.438
Wally, you're a caterpillar, right?

23:25.472 --> 23:28.008
How kind of you to notice.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.109
So, do you suppose

23:29.142 --> 23:32.179
you're going to pupate and stuff?

23:32.212 --> 23:33.180
That's gross.

23:33.213 --> 23:34.214
I'll try to control myself.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.783
Well, if I were you, Wally,

23:35.816 --> 23:37.985
I wouldn't be quite so confident.

23:38.018 --> 23:39.920
It's all very well to say that

23:39.953 --> 23:41.889
you'll try to control yourself,

23:41.922 --> 23:44.592
but pupation is involuntary.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.126
So what does that mean?

23:46.159 --> 23:48.629
Oh, a complete rebirth.

23:48.662 --> 23:50.063
Though, once that happens,

23:50.097 --> 23:53.834
I can't guarantee that the
reverse body swap will work.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.769
You're not exactly under warranty.

23:55.803 --> 23:57.571
What? Why?

23:57.605 --> 23:58.639
Why me?

23:58.672 --> 24:00.473
Why am I always the punchline?

24:00.508 --> 24:04.678
Oh, it's all because
of your Improve-riser,

24:04.712 --> 24:06.213
it made me think I could be better

24:06.246 --> 24:09.482
like everybody else, I was fine

24:09.517 --> 24:10.551
being just Wally.

24:10.584 --> 24:12.786
I was used to it, can't you see?

24:12.820 --> 24:13.954
Used to it.

24:13.987 --> 24:18.659
I want my life back.

24:18.692 --> 24:19.693
Grab him.

24:19.727 --> 24:21.228
He's going down the hill.

24:23.096 --> 24:25.666
- Wally.
- I can't swim.

24:25.699 --> 24:26.967
Someone help me.

24:29.169 --> 24:31.104
I'm too scared to die.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.706
Oh, wait for us.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.510
Wally, don't worry,

24:36.544 --> 24:38.145
we'll get you.

24:38.178 --> 24:40.180
Hurry it up.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.228
Whoa!

24:55.262 --> 24:57.130
- Berry.
- What?

25:19.319 --> 25:21.288
Got it.

25:21.321 --> 25:22.690
I'm losing it.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.091
Krash, thank you.

25:24.124 --> 25:25.793
Finally, it's all over.

25:25.826 --> 25:26.827
No.

25:32.165 --> 25:34.234
Oh, it's not easy being green,

25:34.267 --> 25:37.304
or a caterpillar, or trapped in a jar

25:37.337 --> 25:40.007
floating down a river.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.142
I'm a sheep, mom.

25:42.175 --> 25:44.177
I'm always wearing a sweater.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.115
Just stay still, maybe he won't see me.

25:48.148 --> 25:49.349
Maybe he'll go away.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.350
Ah, phew.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.085
Things are finally... aaah!

25:52.119 --> 25:54.788
Why am I so irresistible to seafood?

25:58.025 --> 26:00.994
Oh, no, not you again.

26:01.028 --> 26:03.196
Man, it's all right.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.365
Not the jar.

26:05.398 --> 26:06.667
Oh, no, where is it?

26:06.700 --> 26:09.002
Where?

26:09.036 --> 26:11.639
Why am I so tasty?

26:11.672 --> 26:14.608
Oh, that rock...

26:14.642 --> 26:16.043
How do I get out?

26:31.892 --> 26:34.194
Oh, I take it back.

26:34.227 --> 26:36.664
I like the fish better.

26:38.298 --> 26:40.868
Come on, Wally,
pump those caterpillar legs.

26:44.137 --> 26:45.405
Well, at least there's no spider...

26:51.011 --> 26:52.980
What's that?

26:53.013 --> 26:54.948
Oh, I don't... well, I don't
know what that is.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.224
I'm hallucinating.

27:04.257 --> 27:06.193
You can't possibly be real, right?

27:11.364 --> 27:13.867
Stay away.
I'm extremely poisonous.

27:38.926 --> 27:40.828
What do you mean strange?

27:40.861 --> 27:43.964
What do you mean strange?
Come see.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.066
How far is it?

27:46.099 --> 27:48.235
Shh.
It's right...

27:48.268 --> 27:49.703
- Huh?
- ...there.

27:59.046 --> 28:00.413
Looks like someone was sleepwalking

28:00.447 --> 28:02.249
and cut our grass.

28:02.282 --> 28:03.751
No.

28:03.784 --> 28:05.385
Then, what...
What is it?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.689
There.

28:13.460 --> 28:16.063
- It's...
- A giant cotton ball?

28:16.096 --> 28:17.497
No.

28:17.531 --> 28:19.800
It's him.

28:23.336 --> 28:27.775
I never thought I'd live
to see this moment.

28:29.409 --> 28:31.211
Hello? Anyone?

28:32.479 --> 28:35.215
Anyone that doesn't
wanna eat me, I mean.

28:42.956 --> 28:44.892
Hi, there.
Nice day.

28:48.495 --> 28:50.163
No, sorry.

28:50.197 --> 28:51.198
Terrible day.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.301
What's happening?

29:06.980 --> 29:08.849
Diesel,

29:08.882 --> 29:10.083
so this is supposed to be

29:10.117 --> 29:12.319
- the ancient Chief's crypt?
- Yes.

29:12.352 --> 29:14.888
More like the ancient Chief's dump.

29:14.922 --> 29:18.125
Where's all the gold
and the shiny stones, huh?

29:18.158 --> 29:19.392
What was he Chief of?

29:19.426 --> 29:20.994
The neighborhood landfill?

29:22.162 --> 29:25.065
Oh, come on, Lara, don't start
with that now, please.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.233
Start what?

29:26.266 --> 29:28.936
This nonsense started seven crypts ago.

29:28.969 --> 29:32.039
Each one is empty
as your rock hard cranium.

29:32.072 --> 29:35.242
My mom told me to steer clear
of half-baked Indiana Jones-es,

29:35.275 --> 29:37.545
but did I listen?
No.

29:37.578 --> 29:40.914
Hey, it's a really nice vase.

29:40.948 --> 29:43.316
Or a chamber pot, gorgeous one though.

29:43.350 --> 29:45.185
Get that skanky thing out of my face.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.555
We're treasure hunters,
not junk dealers.

29:47.588 --> 29:50.223
Aye, more treasures for yours truly.

29:51.391 --> 29:52.225
There you go.

29:52.259 --> 29:54.862
It's time to blow this candy stand.

30:04.972 --> 30:06.540
- Wally.
- Wally.

30:06.574 --> 30:09.476
- Wally.
- Wa... huh?

30:09.510 --> 30:11.879
Wally, hey, is that you?
Hey, buddy boy.

30:11.912 --> 30:13.547
Here you go, little pal.

30:13.581 --> 30:14.848
Oh, easy, fella.

30:14.882 --> 30:15.849
Ow.

30:15.883 --> 30:18.151
Ungrateful worm.
I ought to...

30:18.185 --> 30:19.386
Hang on, gang.

30:19.419 --> 30:22.355
Does anyone have an odd feeling
at the moment?

30:22.389 --> 30:23.924
Yeah, my tushy fell asleep.

30:23.957 --> 30:26.226
Phew, thanks for asking.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.294
Whoa.

30:27.327 --> 30:28.562
Oh.

30:29.663 --> 30:31.198
Oh, somebody help.

30:31.231 --> 30:32.199
Help.

30:32.232 --> 30:33.867
Let me go.

30:33.901 --> 30:35.503
A village?

30:35.536 --> 30:38.271
Well, I'll be a pickled pot roast.

30:50.618 --> 30:52.520
Wisest of the rulers,

30:52.553 --> 30:55.322
he who communes with the spirits.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.323
Hey.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.592
Hey, I'm talking to you, King.

31:00.961 --> 31:02.329
Hey, everyone.

31:02.362 --> 31:04.532
This is a pretty righteous party.

31:06.499 --> 31:08.101
Love the beat, right?
Pop.

31:09.670 --> 31:12.305
Forgive me,
but there's no time for beats.

31:12.339 --> 31:14.341
He has come for real.

31:14.374 --> 31:16.176
He has come?
What you talking about?

31:17.511 --> 31:20.914
The Golden Dragon.

31:20.948 --> 31:22.082
What?

31:22.115 --> 31:23.316
Well, that's great.

31:23.350 --> 31:24.685
I was not expecting him yet.

31:26.119 --> 31:28.088
Hey, guys, great news.

31:28.121 --> 31:30.958
The Golden Dragon showed up, yeehaw.

31:30.991 --> 31:31.959
Yes.

31:33.426 --> 31:35.996
I never thought I'd live
to see this moment.

31:37.464 --> 31:39.232
Okay.
Rock it.

31:39.266 --> 31:42.603
Now hit us with that all hail thingy.

31:42.636 --> 31:44.404
All hail the great

31:44.437 --> 31:46.106
and powerful

31:46.139 --> 31:49.142
Golden Dragon.

31:49.176 --> 31:51.478
He who shines like the yellow sun

31:51.512 --> 31:54.281
and whose awesome power
is without limits.

31:54.314 --> 31:56.349
- Yes.
- Golden Dragon...

31:56.383 --> 31:58.485
The prophecy is coming true.

31:58.519 --> 32:01.154
He has come.

32:02.523 --> 32:04.625
What am I looking at, hmm?

32:04.658 --> 32:08.596
An aboriginal cult built
around some kind of idol,

32:08.629 --> 32:11.164
undoubtedly some strange figure,

32:11.198 --> 32:13.634
the likes of which we've never seen.

32:16.203 --> 32:18.972
Hail Golden Dragon.

32:21.742 --> 32:24.377
Call me crazy, but doesn't that
look a lot like...

32:24.411 --> 32:25.746
Hail The Golden Dragon.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.515
Hail The Golden Dragon.

32:27.548 --> 32:29.482
Hail The Golden Dragon.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.991
He's so charming and regal

32:38.025 --> 32:40.427
- and handsome.
- So magnificent.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.763
The prophecy is coming true.

32:42.796 --> 32:45.298
At last, we are saved.

32:45.332 --> 32:46.667
Well, that's just lovely.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.302
We got an international conflict
on our hands.

32:49.336 --> 32:51.271
Now that he's a deity, they certainly

32:51.304 --> 32:52.640
won't just hand him over to us.

32:52.673 --> 32:54.374
I think the potential for success

32:54.407 --> 32:57.110
marginally outweighs
the anticipated risk.

32:57.144 --> 32:59.479
I also think I might fall out
of this tree.

32:59.513 --> 33:00.413
Look at him.

33:00.447 --> 33:03.150
What a gorgeous couple
he and my daughter

33:03.183 --> 33:04.317
are going to make.

33:04.351 --> 33:06.520
I've never been so proud.

33:06.554 --> 33:08.622
- Isn't she cute?
- I'm afraid, sir,

33:08.656 --> 33:13.360
that the Golden Dragon
has a higher purpose than that.

33:13.393 --> 33:16.029
He can have his cake and eat it, too.

33:16.063 --> 33:17.765
Go find out his marital status

33:17.798 --> 33:20.501
and be subtle,
we wouldn't wanna spook him.

33:20.534 --> 33:21.434
As you wish, sir.

33:21.468 --> 33:23.771
Though the Dragon
may not actually speak,

33:23.804 --> 33:25.205
or so it seems.

33:25.238 --> 33:26.774
Huh, hmm.

33:37.217 --> 33:38.185
Lara, we've been searching

33:38.218 --> 33:40.153
with this contraption for hours.

33:40.187 --> 33:42.289
It's not my fault
there's no burial crypts

33:42.322 --> 33:44.558
left in this jungle.

33:44.592 --> 33:46.760
Keep whining,
and there'll be at least one.

33:46.794 --> 33:48.061
Now keep looking.

33:49.496 --> 33:51.264
We're not quitting
till we strike it big.

33:51.298 --> 33:53.200
Says you.
I've had it.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.135
Let's pack up and hit the road.

33:55.168 --> 33:56.837
No, you can't do that.

33:58.506 --> 34:00.373
What potato was that?

34:02.142 --> 34:04.311
Diesel, how many times have I said,

34:04.344 --> 34:05.713
cut out the trash collecting?

34:05.746 --> 34:07.280
Now we've got a haunted chamber pot.

34:07.314 --> 34:10.117
I think it's Satan!

34:10.150 --> 34:11.552
Huh?

34:11.585 --> 34:12.553
Hello.

34:12.585 --> 34:14.121
Kill it.

34:14.154 --> 34:15.789
- Whoa.
- No, leave it behind.

34:15.822 --> 34:16.790
Whoa.

34:19.226 --> 34:21.128
I'm just a bighorn sheep trapped
in a bug's body.

34:21.161 --> 34:22.830
See?
Totally normal.

34:22.862 --> 34:24.097
I have references.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.699
- No.
- What happened?

34:25.733 --> 34:28.201
- To get to know each other.
- Hey, you caught him.

34:28.235 --> 34:29.603
Whoa.
Wait a minute.

34:29.637 --> 34:31.371
- Stop.
- You got him.

34:31.404 --> 34:33.440
Oh, boy.
Is it...?

34:33.473 --> 34:34.542
Die.

34:34.574 --> 34:35.543
Huh?

34:36.710 --> 34:38.210
Oh, please believe me,

34:38.245 --> 34:40.714
I'm a sheep.

34:40.748 --> 34:42.415
That's so funny.

34:42.449 --> 34:44.784
I can swear that fish is talking.

34:47.387 --> 34:48.822
And that's how I lost my body

34:48.856 --> 34:51.324
and my friends in that order.

34:51.358 --> 34:52.560
I can't go on like this.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.226
It's cold without wool.

34:54.261 --> 34:56.764
I need your help to get my body back.

34:58.165 --> 34:59.800
Now let me ask you something,

34:59.833 --> 35:01.334
because I was wondering,

35:01.368 --> 35:04.171
do we look like a charity
for freaks of science?

35:05.906 --> 35:07.340
Um, no.
I guess you don't.

35:08.642 --> 35:10.310
Good, because if we were, we'd be broke.

35:10.343 --> 35:12.179
Go find some other idiots.

35:12.212 --> 35:13.213
Or some other body.

35:17.851 --> 35:20.187
Oh, no.
My pupation is starting.

35:20.220 --> 35:22.255
Help me, help me.

35:22.289 --> 35:23.323
Help.

35:23.356 --> 35:26.393
I could use some help, too,
honey, financially.

35:27.427 --> 35:28.696
I can't control it.

35:28.729 --> 35:30.598
Lara, he can't control it.

35:30.631 --> 35:32.399
Hurry.
We should call somebody,

35:32.432 --> 35:35.302
the pupae brigade or NASA.

35:35.335 --> 35:37.871
This almost makes up
for not having WIFI.

35:37.905 --> 35:40.508
Diesel.

35:40.541 --> 35:43.577
Lara, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

35:43.611 --> 35:45.412
When do we go in?

35:45.445 --> 35:46.780
I knew you'd come around.

35:46.814 --> 35:47.881
Just, can we hurry up?

35:47.915 --> 35:49.482
I'm pupating.

35:51.284 --> 35:53.220
I can't shake the feeling

35:53.253 --> 35:55.756
- that we're missing something.
- Forget it.

35:55.789 --> 35:57.925
I'll tell you what we're missing.

35:57.958 --> 35:59.760
Native moves.

36:15.643 --> 36:17.244
Remember, you gotta blend in

36:17.277 --> 36:18.411
with the crowd.

36:20.247 --> 36:21.348
Flaunt it.

36:21.381 --> 36:23.283
Come on.
Jazz toe.

36:23.316 --> 36:25.485
Oh.

36:25.519 --> 36:26.453
It's unbelievable.

36:26.486 --> 36:27.788
We are here sorting bugs,

36:27.821 --> 36:30.558
and they decide they've got
to go start a boy band,

36:30.591 --> 36:32.292
but our opinion doesn't count.

36:32.325 --> 36:34.494
We're just < fräuleins >.

36:34.528 --> 36:37.831
Yup, that's the way
they always treat us girls.

36:37.865 --> 36:40.501
It just seem to be our fate.

36:40.534 --> 36:41.902
Fate my tail.

36:41.935 --> 36:45.706
This job is as disgusting
as it is pointless.

36:45.739 --> 36:47.608
Wally.

36:47.641 --> 36:50.511
Wally.

36:50.544 --> 36:51.912
Wally.

36:51.945 --> 36:53.614
Dokko, what's with this makeup?

36:53.647 --> 36:54.748
I'm itchy all over.

36:54.782 --> 36:56.283
I really can't see why.

36:56.316 --> 36:57.918
I didn't use that much poison ivy.

36:57.951 --> 36:59.019
All right, guys.

36:59.052 --> 37:00.020
It's show time.

37:04.725 --> 37:05.893
Next load of fruit.

37:05.926 --> 37:07.628
Keep it coming.
Pick it up.

37:07.661 --> 37:10.798
The Golden Dragon's mission
will require a lot of energy.

37:10.831 --> 37:12.833
Let's do this.

37:12.866 --> 37:13.967
Keep moving.

37:14.001 --> 37:16.570
Act natural.

37:16.604 --> 37:17.771
Hmm?

37:24.545 --> 37:25.846
That was strange.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.684
Keep it up, guys.

37:30.718 --> 37:32.553
Look for a chance to fan out.

37:38.726 --> 37:39.993
Now's our moment.
Move it.

37:40.027 --> 37:41.428
Oh, gosh.

37:48.035 --> 37:49.503
Get ready to rush him.

37:49.537 --> 37:50.704
Wait for my signal.

37:50.738 --> 37:52.573
Itchy, so itchy.

37:52.606 --> 37:54.074
Keep it together, Berry.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.843
I'm trying, I'm trying.

37:59.346 --> 38:00.581
Imposters.

38:00.614 --> 38:02.382
Seize the strangers.

38:06.086 --> 38:07.387
Told you.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.356
I think they might have caught onto us.

38:09.389 --> 38:10.991
It's starting, pupating.

38:11.024 --> 38:12.425
I'm starting to grow a cocoon.

38:12.459 --> 38:13.794
Well, do it quietly.

38:13.827 --> 38:15.028
Easy for you to say.

38:15.062 --> 38:16.697
You only ever had one body.

38:16.730 --> 38:18.766
Oh, will you just man up,

38:18.799 --> 38:20.934
you scaredy caterpillar.

38:20.968 --> 38:24.872
I won't be a caterpillar
for long if this continues.

38:24.905 --> 38:26.940
Can't this thing go any faster?

38:26.974 --> 38:28.709
Well, calm down.

38:28.742 --> 38:30.578
Hey, what's that on your back?

38:30.611 --> 38:31.812
- Are those wings?
- What? Where?

38:31.845 --> 38:33.781
Huh?
Get them off, get them off.

38:33.814 --> 38:35.616
Relax, I'm just kidding,

38:35.649 --> 38:37.718
you little green hot dog.

38:40.821 --> 38:41.922
Here we are.

38:47.094 --> 38:49.362
See, we're not from around here.

38:49.396 --> 38:51.699
No, but we do come in peace.

38:51.732 --> 38:53.634
Yeah, to pay our respects

38:53.667 --> 38:55.002
to the great and powerful

38:55.035 --> 38:56.036
Golden Dragon.

39:09.983 --> 39:16.924
* It is the time... *

39:16.957 --> 39:23.897
* Pleasing just like the sun... *

39:23.931 --> 39:25.933
* He's come at last *

39:25.966 --> 39:34.575
* The golden one... *

39:36.844 --> 39:39.479
* Came from the sky
with the fire in his gut *

39:39.513 --> 39:41.949
* Proven that the gecko
and the grasses eat at night *

39:41.982 --> 39:44.718
* To save this world
that's why he came *

39:44.752 --> 39:47.420
* < Burning through your heart >
< like a fluffy-uffy flame > *

39:47.454 --> 39:49.790
* Golden, Golden Dragon *

39:49.823 --> 39:51.424
* Good God y'all *

39:51.458 --> 39:52.726
* Can you feel me? *

39:52.760 --> 39:55.563
* Golden Dragon, yeah,
Golden Dragon, yeah *

39:55.596 --> 39:58.031
* Golden Dragon, yeah,
Golden Dragon, yeah *

39:58.065 --> 40:00.768
* Dragon, woo *

40:00.801 --> 40:03.671
* Dragon, woo *

40:03.704 --> 40:05.005
Hey, you like it?

40:05.038 --> 40:06.807
* Golden Dragon *

40:06.840 --> 40:08.075
Release them,

40:08.108 --> 40:09.910
true believers.

40:09.943 --> 40:10.944
Release them.

40:42.610 --> 40:44.044
Follow me.

40:44.077 --> 40:45.579
What are you waiting for?

40:45.613 --> 40:47.815
We're the ones carrying Wally's body.

40:47.848 --> 40:48.982
What are you doing?

40:49.016 --> 40:51.484
I'm navigating.
Starboard ten degrees.

40:51.519 --> 40:53.086
Krash, wait for us.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.723
Everyone else's costume riding up?

40:57.725 --> 40:59.793
Let's take a breather.

40:59.827 --> 41:01.929
A smart move,

41:01.962 --> 41:03.496
- very smart.
- We're dead.

41:03.531 --> 41:05.733
Decided to see the library
while you're here?

41:05.766 --> 41:08.869
Oh, the library?
Oh, yeah.

41:08.902 --> 41:10.704
You guys got good taste.

41:10.738 --> 41:13.507
Hmm, yes, indeed.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.175
Yeah, we can't wait.

41:15.208 --> 41:17.277
Alec, go on and give them
the whole mini tour.

41:17.310 --> 41:19.246
- Huh?
- Uh-hmm.

41:19.279 --> 41:21.081
You know how I love your mini tour.

41:21.114 --> 41:23.951
You're the best.

41:23.984 --> 41:26.053
Well, if I must.

41:28.088 --> 41:29.857
The prophecy set in stone

41:29.890 --> 41:31.559
by our ancestors of old

41:31.592 --> 41:32.826
speaks of the coming

41:32.860 --> 41:34.695
of The Golden Dragon.

41:34.728 --> 41:36.864
Notice the delicate carving work

41:36.897 --> 41:38.131
and the striking realism

41:38.165 --> 41:40.000
of the painting.

41:40.033 --> 41:42.002
- Huh?
- It's Wally.

41:42.035 --> 41:43.704
Well, I mean, The Gold Dragon.

41:43.737 --> 41:45.138
What a likeness.

41:45.172 --> 41:48.141
No, that's where an old hunk
of cheese hit the wall.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.643
This is it.

41:50.844 --> 41:52.312
Hmm.

41:52.345 --> 41:53.947
Would you look at that,

41:53.981 --> 41:55.716
it's beautiful.

41:55.749 --> 41:56.917
I know, right?

41:56.950 --> 41:58.886
Hey, I like you guys.

41:58.919 --> 42:00.654
By the way, are any of you single?

42:00.688 --> 42:03.123
Because I got a daughter, and
she's as single as they come.

42:03.156 --> 42:05.158
I have... oh, as our hearts,

42:05.192 --> 42:06.694
belong to the Golden Dragon.

42:06.727 --> 42:09.897
We've all taken a vow of celibacy.

42:09.930 --> 42:11.264
Not my day.

42:11.298 --> 42:12.099
That's right.

42:12.132 --> 42:14.935
Shall we move on to the next exhibit?

42:14.968 --> 42:17.237
The prophecy says
the Golden Dragon's arrival

42:17.270 --> 42:18.872
will bring great joy

42:18.906 --> 42:20.073
followed by glee,

42:20.107 --> 42:22.242
elation, delight, slight dizziness,

42:22.275 --> 42:24.044
and finally, bliss,

42:24.077 --> 42:26.079
which we are all experiencing now.

42:26.113 --> 42:28.048
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
So his work here is done,

42:28.081 --> 42:30.918
and off he goes on his way.
Congrats.

42:30.951 --> 42:33.353
Not congrats.

42:33.386 --> 42:34.722
For what follows next

42:34.755 --> 42:39.126
is no less than unspeakable horror.

42:43.997 --> 42:46.233
But the next part
of the prophecy is broken off.

42:46.266 --> 42:49.670
So, nobody knows exactly
what this unspeakable horror is.

42:49.703 --> 42:50.871
But we shall indeed be saved

42:50.904 --> 42:52.973
from even this by the great and wise

42:53.006 --> 42:55.809
Golden Dragon.

42:55.843 --> 42:58.812
A comfort to know you're in good hands.

42:58.846 --> 43:01.214
All right.
This is not looking good.

43:01.248 --> 43:04.217
First of all, the place
has these high rock walls,

43:04.251 --> 43:07.187
and the worms' carcass
is right in the middle, here.

43:07.220 --> 43:09.322
Plus, he's surrounded by insane natives

43:09.356 --> 43:11.158
and lookouts in towers here,

43:11.191 --> 43:14.161
here, and here,
all with poison-tip spears.

43:14.194 --> 43:15.829
Oh, great.
Got it.

43:15.863 --> 43:17.130
So, when do we all get moving?

43:17.164 --> 43:18.298
Shut up, alien.

43:18.331 --> 43:19.800
I am trying to convey

43:19.833 --> 43:21.702
that this is not
a two-person job

43:21.735 --> 43:22.770
we got here.

43:22.803 --> 43:24.672
Two person?

43:24.705 --> 43:25.706
There are three.

43:25.739 --> 43:26.974
You forgot Lara.

43:27.007 --> 43:29.076
I've had enough of you, hot dog.

43:29.109 --> 43:31.144
Why don't you just stick
a pineapple in it,

43:31.178 --> 43:33.847
and fly off,
and save your own sorry body?

43:33.881 --> 43:36.016
Huh, that could work.

43:38.418 --> 43:40.187
This is the worst idea in the history

43:40.220 --> 43:43.090
of terrible ideas.

43:43.123 --> 43:45.125
Oh.

43:45.158 --> 43:46.927
If sheep were meant to fly,

43:46.960 --> 43:49.062
we would have big, fluffy wings.

43:49.096 --> 43:51.799
Oh, oh, this is insane.

43:51.832 --> 43:53.366
Oh.

43:56.970 --> 43:59.072
Cut the screaming.
Over.

43:59.106 --> 44:01.975
Oh, this plan makes no sense.

44:02.009 --> 44:02.843
Of course, it does.

44:02.876 --> 44:05.245
Just take that pineapple near the body,

44:05.278 --> 44:07.848
and it's a done deal, baby.

44:07.881 --> 44:09.149
Oh, I'm about to be killed

44:09.182 --> 44:12.085
by a tree, a monstrous, evil tree.

44:12.119 --> 44:13.887
Don't do that.
Just turn it.

44:13.921 --> 44:14.922
Turn it to the side.

44:14.955 --> 44:15.923
But how?

44:15.956 --> 44:17.758
Actually, I have no idea.

44:17.791 --> 44:19.326
Oh.

44:26.199 --> 44:28.802
Oh, well, so much for that plan.

44:29.903 --> 44:32.305
Ha.
Take that, tree.

44:32.339 --> 44:33.707
Score one, Wally.

44:33.741 --> 44:35.308
Yeah.

44:37.077 --> 44:39.079
Jeepers, you had us worried,

44:39.112 --> 44:40.781
you grubby little dork.

44:44.518 --> 44:45.886
I'm flying.

44:45.919 --> 44:48.188
You hear me?
I'm flying.

44:48.221 --> 44:49.456
Yay.

45:22.923 --> 45:24.324
Hot Dog to base.

45:24.357 --> 45:26.326
No, scratch that.

45:26.359 --> 45:28.261
From this point on, you can call me

45:28.295 --> 45:31.999
Captain Larvo.

45:32.032 --> 45:34.401
Settle down up there.

45:34.434 --> 45:36.770
Yes, with purpose, he'll soar,

45:36.804 --> 45:38.506
hear him bark, hear him roar

45:38.539 --> 45:41.942
that amazing

45:41.975 --> 45:45.846
Captain Larvo.

45:52.853 --> 45:54.154
Come on, Gary, get with it.

45:54.187 --> 45:55.188
Oh, come on.

45:55.222 --> 45:56.924
It's the middle of the night.

45:56.957 --> 45:58.926
I need my beauty sleep.

45:58.959 --> 46:00.027
No kidding.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.095
Shh, shh, quiet everyone.

46:04.064 --> 46:06.767
All right.
Now, can it.

46:08.902 --> 46:12.005
Good, everyone's sound asleep.

46:12.039 --> 46:14.842
Yeah.
And they got the right idea.

46:14.875 --> 46:19.179
You go, I'll just be leaning right here.

46:19.212 --> 46:20.480
Oh.

46:20.514 --> 46:22.482
No, no, no, no, no.

46:28.288 --> 46:30.457
Killer drum solo, dude.

46:30.490 --> 46:33.026
Rock on.

46:33.060 --> 46:35.262
Okay.
Now I'm awake.

46:38.165 --> 46:39.232
All right, guys.

46:39.266 --> 46:42.069
Let's get us a Golden Dragon.

46:42.102 --> 46:43.136
Hmm.

46:43.170 --> 46:44.271
Captain Larvo to base.

46:44.304 --> 46:46.907
This place is a lot darker
at night for some reason.

46:46.940 --> 46:48.408
- Over.
- < Quit the whining >.

46:48.441 --> 46:50.077
- < Over >.
- Quitting the whining.

46:50.110 --> 46:51.344
- Over.
- < Roger that >.

46:51.378 --> 46:52.279
Over.

46:52.312 --> 46:54.381
Can I say something other than over?

46:54.414 --> 46:55.883
Over.

46:57.284 --> 46:59.386
- Oh.
- Shh, quiet.

46:59.419 --> 47:01.188
Don't step on the zealots.

47:02.590 --> 47:04.391
- Grab it and run.
- No running.

47:04.424 --> 47:06.894
You'll drop it.
Stroll.

47:06.927 --> 47:08.195
Sound the alarm.

47:08.228 --> 47:09.462
Do we have an alarm?

47:09.496 --> 47:10.964
Build an alarm.

47:12.199 --> 47:13.433
Sorry about that.

47:13.466 --> 47:15.402
Oh, oh, green alert.

47:15.435 --> 47:16.604
The natives are taking him away.

47:16.637 --> 47:19.907
I mean, me... I mean, help.

47:19.940 --> 47:22.142
When in doubt, blow things up.

47:22.175 --> 47:23.210
You crazy?

47:23.243 --> 47:24.512
We need that body.

47:24.545 --> 47:26.479
Listen, Captain Lard for Brains,

47:26.514 --> 47:28.248
do not wimp out now!

47:28.281 --> 47:30.050
Okay, fine.
I guess I'll try.

47:30.083 --> 47:31.151
Oh.

47:31.184 --> 47:33.554
Go, go, go, go, go.
Come on, let's move it, move it.

47:33.587 --> 47:34.955
Now pick it up with scamper.

47:34.988 --> 47:36.223
I prefer a trot.

47:36.256 --> 47:37.490
Pineapple away.

47:37.525 --> 47:40.360
Feel the wrath of my mighty pineapple.

47:40.393 --> 47:41.595
Hey.

47:41.629 --> 47:43.897
Oh, heading back victorious

47:43.931 --> 47:45.465
from a dangerous mission.

47:45.498 --> 47:47.434
Oh, that's a good feeling.

47:47.467 --> 47:51.271
Yeah, Wally just feels
lighter and lighter.

47:51.304 --> 47:54.908
Unless we got stronger.

47:54.942 --> 47:56.309
Me manly.

47:56.343 --> 47:58.512
What is this strange object?

47:58.546 --> 47:59.547
Huh?

47:59.580 --> 48:01.481
Well, I'll be.

48:01.515 --> 48:04.351
Uh-oh, that pineapple
is trying to steal Wally.

48:04.384 --> 48:05.418
Oh, after it.

48:05.452 --> 48:06.954
- Go.
- Go.

48:09.523 --> 48:11.158
Trey, can you make it?

48:11.191 --> 48:13.026
- Follow that fruit.
- I've been spotted.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.162
- What should I do?
- Find a back way out.

48:15.195 --> 48:17.598
Roger, you got it.

48:17.631 --> 48:19.432
No, this way.

48:21.001 --> 48:21.969
Sorry.

48:22.002 --> 48:24.137
Track practice.

48:27.174 --> 48:28.308
Thanks.

48:30.443 --> 48:31.945
Base, come in base.

48:31.979 --> 48:34.481
Huh?
Oh, great.

48:34.515 --> 48:36.283
Just what I needed.
A dropped call.

48:36.316 --> 48:38.185
All right, Captain Larvo.

48:38.218 --> 48:40.521
You're on your own.

48:40.554 --> 48:41.989
Stop.

48:42.022 --> 48:43.591
Son of a sheep.

48:45.158 --> 48:46.694
Attention, passenger.

48:46.727 --> 48:48.495
We are ready for take-off.

48:56.236 --> 48:58.071
Oh, after all that...

48:58.105 --> 48:59.072
Oh, he...

48:59.106 --> 49:00.207
No.

49:14.722 --> 49:16.289
All right.

49:16.323 --> 49:18.458
What did you do with the Golden Dragon,

49:18.491 --> 49:20.393
hmm?

49:20.427 --> 49:23.296
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, bub.

49:27.768 --> 49:29.503
Huh?

49:29.537 --> 49:31.404
Hi, honeys.
I'm home.

49:32.806 --> 49:34.775
I'm telling you, something's gone wrong.

49:34.808 --> 49:36.610
All they had to do was steal
Wally's body

49:36.644 --> 49:38.378
from a tribe of savage natives.

49:38.411 --> 49:40.748
How long can that take?

49:40.781 --> 49:42.115
Patience, my dear.

49:42.149 --> 49:45.719
Patience.
It's a woman's finest virtue.

49:45.753 --> 49:47.521
Three years ago, I asked Berry

49:47.555 --> 49:50.290
to hammer a nail to hang my pot holder.

49:51.725 --> 49:53.026
Think he's gotten around to it?

49:53.060 --> 49:54.394
That's what I'm saying.

49:54.427 --> 49:57.430
How long are we supposed
to wait? Sister...

49:57.464 --> 49:59.667
it's time to hammer some nails.

50:01.234 --> 50:02.269
Hmm?

50:02.302 --> 50:04.204
Oh, yeah,

50:04.237 --> 50:07.541
we're gonna hammer some nails, alright.

50:09.843 --> 50:11.812
Look at it, it's so beautiful.

50:11.845 --> 50:13.647
- Yeah.
- And, oh...

50:13.681 --> 50:15.115
I love antiques,

50:15.148 --> 50:17.685
especially the ones worth
a butt-load.

50:17.718 --> 50:19.553
I'll tell you, spirits are flying.

50:19.587 --> 50:21.388
I bank left, they're there.

50:21.421 --> 50:23.123
I bank right.
They're still there.

50:23.156 --> 50:24.391
So I climb,

50:24.424 --> 50:25.693
climbing, and climbing,

50:25.726 --> 50:28.295
and, I did it.

50:28.328 --> 50:32.733
I did it all by myself
without any Improve-riser at all,

50:32.766 --> 50:35.302
just me, just Wally.

50:35.335 --> 50:37.270
Huh?
Huh?

50:37.304 --> 50:39.607
And I even got my body.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.174
Woohoo.

50:41.208 --> 50:43.210
Okay.
Let's do this, you guys.

50:43.243 --> 50:45.112
It's time to fire it up.

50:45.145 --> 50:46.413
What do you say?

50:46.446 --> 50:49.550
Aha, cool.
So, how do you work this thing?

50:49.583 --> 50:52.119
First, you pull the little lever there,

50:52.152 --> 50:54.187
then you turn the knob
till the power's at maximum,

50:54.221 --> 50:55.623
- and then you're all set.
- < Uh-hmm, uh-hmm >.

50:55.656 --> 50:57.390
Just press that button on top.

50:57.424 --> 50:59.560
Okay, got it.
Hang on.

50:59.593 --> 51:01.795
Good-bye, old Wally.

51:01.829 --> 51:05.298
Hello, new and improved Wally.

51:16.209 --> 51:18.579
Bullseye.

51:18.612 --> 51:19.580
How was it?

51:19.613 --> 51:21.615
Strange

51:21.649 --> 51:23.784
and woozy.

51:23.817 --> 51:25.753
But I'm still a caterpillar.

51:25.786 --> 51:27.420
You worked the machine wrong.

51:27.454 --> 51:29.389
But, no, no, wait.
You were supposed to focus

51:29.422 --> 51:30.791
the beam at me.

51:30.824 --> 51:32.425
Oh, oh,

51:32.459 --> 51:34.361
I have this horrible compunction to go

51:34.394 --> 51:36.597
and make these natives give me
all their gold.

51:36.630 --> 51:37.665
All of it.

51:37.698 --> 51:39.299
How could they refuse the needs

51:39.332 --> 51:42.202
of their very own god?

51:43.470 --> 51:45.405
Yeah.
They can never deny you,

51:45.438 --> 51:47.407
now that you're such a beautiful deity.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.442
Oh, are you saying
I look better as a sheep?

51:49.476 --> 51:51.378
No, no.
Totally not saying that at all.

51:51.411 --> 51:54.447
Oh, you are so sleeping
in the garbage can tonight.

51:54.481 --> 51:56.449
- You're unbelievable.
- You used me.

51:56.483 --> 51:57.618
But I got to admit,

51:57.651 --> 51:59.820
that loser caterpillar bought it all.

52:04.592 --> 52:06.393
Hold it right there.

52:06.426 --> 52:09.429
I won't let you use my body
for criminal activities,

52:09.462 --> 52:10.864
except cheating at board games.

52:10.898 --> 52:12.365
Do you understand me?

52:12.399 --> 52:13.867
Huh?
Do you?

52:15.335 --> 52:18.606
- He ain't fooling.
- So, hear me roar, darn it.

52:18.639 --> 52:20.473
Aah. Aaaah!

52:24.311 --> 52:26.379
Got him!

52:27.347 --> 52:29.349
We don't negotiate with terrorists,

52:29.382 --> 52:31.484
especially those that
have been brainwashed!

52:36.824 --> 52:37.891
And you're telling us all,

52:37.925 --> 52:39.560
the Golden Dragon

52:39.593 --> 52:40.528
is a caterpillar?

52:40.561 --> 52:43.664
Yeah, yeah.
A squishy, little caterpillar.

52:43.697 --> 52:46.700
- Uh-hmm.
- Right.

52:48.435 --> 52:50.704
Yeah.
And flying pineapples.

52:50.738 --> 52:52.806
But the caterpillar was totally into it.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.776
What? I've never heard
more obnoxious blasphemy.

52:55.809 --> 52:57.745
You have defiled our god,

52:57.778 --> 53:00.213
the memory of our greatest ancestors,

53:00.247 --> 53:02.516
our very culture.

53:04.585 --> 53:06.486
Huh?
Huh?

53:11.024 --> 53:11.992
Oh.

53:12.025 --> 53:13.894
He has returned.

53:13.927 --> 53:16.530
All hail the Golden Dragon.

53:16.564 --> 53:18.599
He has returned.

53:19.933 --> 53:21.669
What are you waiting for?

53:21.702 --> 53:23.370
Get over there and start pampering him.

53:23.403 --> 53:24.705
Helper.

53:24.738 --> 53:26.874
Somebody give him a pineapple.

53:26.907 --> 53:28.776
We are saved.

53:30.277 --> 53:31.712
The greedy worm has returned.

53:31.745 --> 53:34.915
Yeah, I guess, there's no need
to execute all of us now.

53:38.652 --> 53:42.355
Oh, I was dreaming about pudding.

53:42.389 --> 53:44.324
I was a good party guest, I think.

53:45.859 --> 53:48.428
Your worshipfulness Golden Dragon.

53:48.461 --> 53:50.297
Allow us to present you

53:50.330 --> 53:53.634
with a token of our worthiness
and respect.

53:53.667 --> 53:55.636
The Golden, Golden Dragon.

54:05.579 --> 54:07.414
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

54:07.447 --> 54:10.450
Come to mama, golden boy.

54:10.483 --> 54:11.585
It worked.

54:11.619 --> 54:13.020
He speaks.

54:13.053 --> 54:14.487
- He speaks.
- He speaks?

54:14.522 --> 54:15.923
He speaks.

54:15.956 --> 54:17.958
- He speaks.
- The Golden Dragon speaks.

54:17.991 --> 54:19.793
Oh, oh.

54:23.330 --> 54:25.833
Oh, who was I kidding?

54:25.866 --> 54:28.368
Captain Larvo?

54:28.401 --> 54:30.504
More like Captain Blunder

54:30.538 --> 54:33.373
or Can't Man, except, you know, sheep.

54:33.406 --> 54:36.510
No, caterpillar, whatever.

54:36.544 --> 54:39.547
Now, you can just call me
The Incredible Suck.

54:39.580 --> 54:41.782
Come now, caterpillar,

54:41.815 --> 54:43.984
one more bitey-witey.

54:44.017 --> 54:46.687
Gotta keep up our strength.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.356
Can this get any weirder?

54:49.389 --> 54:51.324
Here comes the choo-choo

54:51.358 --> 54:53.794
into the face-face.

54:53.827 --> 54:54.828
- Diesel.
- Huh?

54:54.862 --> 54:56.964
- Diesel.
- Huh? Hello?

54:56.997 --> 54:59.567
Guess what these mental
midgets have done.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.602
They melted all the gold
into a giant chunk.

55:01.635 --> 55:04.404
This thing is so big, we're
gonna have to use the crane.

55:04.437 --> 55:05.438
And hurry up.

55:05.472 --> 55:07.074
This body smells terrible.

55:09.376 --> 55:11.579
We've always believed
in the Golden Dragon.

55:11.612 --> 55:14.447
Unlike some trash talking weirdies.

55:14.481 --> 55:15.382
And now,

55:15.415 --> 55:17.585
could you save us
from the deathly terror?

55:17.618 --> 55:18.986
Yeah. What's that thing,

55:19.019 --> 55:21.421
two tons, closer to three?

55:21.454 --> 55:23.824
Now, the worm is talking.
Am I hearing things?

55:23.857 --> 55:25.826
- Maybe it's Wally again.
- Huh?

55:25.859 --> 55:26.994
Wally? Is it you?

55:27.027 --> 55:29.129
Wally, Wally, Wally.

55:29.162 --> 55:31.464
- It's us.
- Hey. Can you hear us?

55:31.498 --> 55:32.600
Wally. Wally.

55:32.633 --> 55:33.867
What the huh?

55:33.901 --> 55:35.435
It's my friends.

55:38.438 --> 55:40.440
All right, Wally, enough.

55:40.473 --> 55:41.842
Time for you to stop joking

55:41.875 --> 55:44.578
and tell these folks
you're not the Golden Dragon.

55:44.612 --> 55:45.746
Do it. Go.

55:45.779 --> 55:47.114
Huh?

55:47.147 --> 55:49.683
* < Gold, gold >, < goldy gold > *

55:49.717 --> 55:51.018
* < Lot s of gold > *

55:52.620 --> 55:54.822
Looks like the execution's back on.

55:54.855 --> 55:58.859
Hey, let's get this
blasphemer barbecue going.

55:58.892 --> 56:01.461
Your Golden Dragon loves you

56:01.494 --> 56:04.898
and you, and you, and you,

56:04.932 --> 56:05.899
and your gold.

56:05.933 --> 56:07.735
Oh, yeah.

56:07.768 --> 56:10.538
Bring it. Boom-shaka-shaka-
shaka-boom.

56:18.812 --> 56:21.815
Huh? I'm free.

56:23.584 --> 56:25.586
Hey. Hey, don't eat that.

56:45.205 --> 56:48.642
Ready? And snatch.

56:52.079 --> 56:54.682
Oh, no.

56:54.715 --> 56:56.584
- Whoa.
- Bad idea.

57:00.153 --> 57:02.723
Well, bless my bullion.

57:02.756 --> 57:03.924
Would you look at that.

57:12.199 --> 57:13.534
What's going on?

57:13.567 --> 57:15.903
Reverse!

57:15.936 --> 57:17.437
Forward!

57:20.140 --> 57:21.775
Lara, help me!

57:21.809 --> 57:23.711
This must stop.
This must stop.

57:23.744 --> 57:25.112
Diesel. Diesel.

57:25.145 --> 57:26.213
You stop.

57:26.246 --> 57:27.214
I'm right here.

57:27.247 --> 57:28.215
Don't ignore me.

57:28.248 --> 57:29.650
I can hear you ignoring me.

57:29.683 --> 57:30.651
Lara?

57:30.684 --> 57:32.119
Whoa.

57:32.152 --> 57:33.954
I'm coming. I'm coming.

57:33.987 --> 57:34.955
I'm coming.

57:36.690 --> 57:38.592
Almost there. Oh, sorry.

57:38.626 --> 57:39.927
I'm so sorry.

57:42.730 --> 57:44.732
Back off. Hey.

57:46.734 --> 57:48.536
Get off of there.

57:51.304 --> 57:52.806
Whoa.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.942
I thought they were just
going to burn us.

57:54.975 --> 57:56.510
This is the appetizer.

57:56.544 --> 57:57.645
Diesel.

58:02.182 --> 58:03.250
Lara.

58:03.283 --> 58:04.652
Lara? Huh?

58:04.685 --> 58:06.186
It's not my fault, Lara.

58:06.219 --> 58:08.155
It was Hotdog. I swear.

58:08.188 --> 58:09.890
Look, those balls of blasphemy

58:09.923 --> 58:12.159
are about to steal the Golden Dragon.

58:12.192 --> 58:14.094
It wasn't us this time, huh?

58:16.630 --> 58:19.099
- Let's move on out.
- Get the defilers.

58:19.132 --> 58:20.901
Don't let them get away.

58:22.202 --> 58:24.672
We hit the jackpot.

58:32.713 --> 58:33.881
- Stop.
- Huh?

58:33.914 --> 58:37.084
Hey, I said stop.

58:38.185 --> 58:40.854
Huh, here's your stop, Hotdog.

58:55.603 --> 58:56.904
No.

59:21.729 --> 59:23.163
This is the best party ever.

59:23.196 --> 59:24.665
I love you, guys.

59:28.669 --> 59:31.805
Hop, nice friend giant, hop!

59:31.839 --> 59:35.075
Is there a seatbelt around here?

59:47.688 --> 59:48.989
Let's go.

59:49.022 --> 59:50.223
Yee-hah.

59:50.257 --> 59:52.626
Ride it, ribbit. Yeah.

01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:06.774
Whoa.

01:00:06.807 --> 01:00:08.275
It is...

01:00:08.308 --> 01:00:10.110
the deathly terror.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.882
Please save us.

01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:16.750
Please, Golden Dragon.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.355
Hey, did you feed my body?

01:00:22.389 --> 01:00:24.124
You know it.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.736
There's nothing to fear
but the spear itself.

01:00:35.769 --> 01:00:36.670
With this treasure,

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:40.007
we can live a life
of leisure for like, uh,

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.142
- three months.
- You're thinking small.

01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:44.712
With that body swapper doohickey,

01:00:44.745 --> 01:00:46.780
we can steal all the gold in the world.

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:48.982
Banzai.

01:00:52.019 --> 01:00:53.821
Huh?

01:00:53.854 --> 01:00:55.155
Yes, finally.

01:00:55.188 --> 01:00:56.790
Diesel.

01:00:56.824 --> 01:00:58.726
- Lara?
- Wally.

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:01.829
Oh, no.

01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:02.930
No.

01:01:05.365 --> 01:01:07.735
That's for my throwing
my friends around, buddy.

01:01:09.302 --> 01:01:11.839
The defilers are trying
to throw off their tracks.

01:01:11.872 --> 01:01:13.741
Now, what do we do?

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:18.746
Quit staring at me
and stop that Hotdog, dingbat.

01:01:18.779 --> 01:01:20.347
Right, right.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.949
Do it.

01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:23.884
Down right here.

01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:25.418
No.

01:01:25.452 --> 01:01:27.154
What happened now?

01:01:28.255 --> 01:01:30.323
I'm coming back for you, guys.

01:01:30.357 --> 01:01:33.093
Diesel, you're not just a dingbat,

01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:34.895
you're the king of the dingbats.

01:01:34.928 --> 01:01:36.163
What a lovely,

01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:39.399
whoa, thing to say.

01:01:39.432 --> 01:01:40.433
My body.

01:01:40.467 --> 01:01:42.903
You're beautiful as always.

01:01:42.936 --> 01:01:45.238
I like that.

01:01:45.272 --> 01:01:47.808
- That's cheese.
- Stop him.

01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:48.876
You got it.

01:01:50.177 --> 01:01:51.278
Take that.

01:01:52.479 --> 01:01:54.848
Wait. Now who am I?

01:01:57.818 --> 01:02:00.353
Hands off my curly carcass.

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:01.488
Diesel, where are you?

01:02:01.522 --> 01:02:04.157
Over here. Hey, Hotdog.

01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.927
And Captain Larvo's driving.

01:02:08.562 --> 01:02:10.831
Diesel, which one are you?

01:02:10.864 --> 01:02:13.033
Sheep, and bang!

01:02:14.868 --> 01:02:16.069
Looks like the worst part

01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:17.404
of the ancient prophecy

01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:19.306
is starting to happen.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:23.511
- Lara.
- Oh, geez,

01:02:23.544 --> 01:02:25.412
I'm a bug again.

01:02:25.445 --> 01:02:28.181
You kids, stop fighting.

01:02:28.215 --> 01:02:30.884
No, not a thing. Get away.

01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:40.961
Keep driving.

01:02:45.999 --> 01:02:47.334
Don't give up.

01:02:47.367 --> 01:02:48.468
Berry doesn't give up.

01:02:48.502 --> 01:02:51.104
I got this.

01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:53.907
Help us, please.

01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:55.342
Just hold the wheel.

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:57.845
You mean this big bango?

01:02:57.878 --> 01:02:59.279
Hey, hey,

01:02:59.312 --> 01:03:01.949
we're losing cargo.

01:03:01.982 --> 01:03:04.417
Whoa, whoa.

01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:06.386
Whoa, whoa.

01:03:06.419 --> 01:03:07.487
Help.

01:03:07.521 --> 01:03:09.923
Somebody.

01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.325
Son of a gun.

01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:14.061
Why is it only in ancient legends

01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:16.363
that the lifesaving dragon
actually appear?

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:19.466
Hang in there, guys.

01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:30.443
What?

01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:32.279
No. No, no, no.

01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:33.280
Not now.

01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:36.884
Oh, please, please not now.

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:37.985
Oh.

01:03:48.962 --> 01:03:50.397
No, not now.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:51.464
Not now.

01:03:55.503 --> 01:03:58.606
No, no, not now.

01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:05.979
No.

01:04:12.419 --> 01:04:13.954
Help.

01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:17.891
- Hot, hot, hot, hot.
- Oh, somebody.

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:21.494
My friends, it's seems it's time

01:04:21.529 --> 01:04:23.463
for the final curtain to fall.

01:04:26.499 --> 01:04:28.335
Hold on tight.

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:29.336
I'm coming.

01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:31.639
- What?
- It's Wally.

01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:32.906
I'm coming.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.441
I'll try to jimmy the the lock.

01:04:34.474 --> 01:04:36.209
It's all over.

01:04:36.243 --> 01:04:39.179
Got to keep it, Berry.

01:04:39.212 --> 01:04:40.013
Oh.

01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:42.249
Wally, you'll never get it.

01:04:42.282 --> 01:04:45.519
A bug just doesn't have
the necessary strength.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.290
That's a theory worth testing, Dokko.

01:04:50.323 --> 01:04:52.059
Help us, Golden Dragon.

01:04:52.092 --> 01:04:53.193
Come on, from the diaphragm.

01:04:53.226 --> 01:04:54.662
Help us, Golden Dragon.

01:04:56.697 --> 01:04:59.166
Help us, Golden Dragon.

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:01.434
Help us Golden Dragon.

01:05:01.468 --> 01:05:04.137
Help us...

01:05:06.339 --> 01:05:07.407
Oh.

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.377
Guys, I think Chiko's on fire.

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.212
Just my feet.

01:05:12.245 --> 01:05:13.213
Astonishing.

01:05:13.246 --> 01:05:15.048
Wally did it.

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:19.653
Did I get something right?

01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:22.422
Yes, Wally.

01:05:22.455 --> 01:05:23.991
You saved us all.

01:05:26.326 --> 01:05:29.496
Sweet little disgusting slumped worth.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.432
- Well, now.
- Huh?

01:05:32.465 --> 01:05:35.402
You boys look like you can use a lift.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:37.705
If you're all finished
with your sonnet, that is.

01:05:37.738 --> 01:05:39.439
I tweak my beak.

01:05:39.472 --> 01:05:41.575
< Fräuleins > do fly.

01:05:41.609 --> 01:05:43.577
Nice going there, ladies.

01:05:43.611 --> 01:05:46.446
That's even nuttier than
the flying pineapple incident.

01:05:46.479 --> 01:05:47.447
Hey, hey.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.448
You boys,

01:05:48.481 --> 01:05:51.719
you better hold on
to your metaphorical acts.

01:05:51.752 --> 01:05:55.055
Because this is what
it sounds like when pigs fly.

01:05:55.088 --> 01:05:58.191
Well, I did not see this coming.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:04.732
What on earth are they doing down there?

01:06:04.765 --> 01:06:09.503
Our only hope of surviving this
is the Golden Dragon.

01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:12.305
So come on and let him really hear you.

01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:15.075
That is not going to work.

01:06:15.108 --> 01:06:17.310
Why are they just sitting there?
Why aren't they running?

01:06:17.344 --> 01:06:18.646
Because they're waiting to be saved

01:06:18.679 --> 01:06:20.748
by the Golden Dragon.

01:06:20.781 --> 01:06:23.551
Are they all completely deranged?

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:26.019
Hey, hey,

01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:27.287
primitive villagers,

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.722
you can't just sit there

01:06:28.756 --> 01:06:30.357
and wait for the Golden Dragon

01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:31.659
to come and save you.

01:06:31.692 --> 01:06:33.293
That's not how it works.

01:06:33.326 --> 01:06:36.664
He only helps those who help themselves.

01:06:36.697 --> 01:06:39.299
So get yourselves up off the ground

01:06:39.332 --> 01:06:41.401
and save yourselves.

01:06:41.434 --> 01:06:44.337
It's what the Golden Dragon would want.

01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:47.107
Can anybody make out
what the blasphemers are saying?

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.441
Listen to Wally.

01:06:48.475 --> 01:06:51.812
I think they're telling us
it's the finale.

01:06:51.845 --> 01:06:54.147
Wowzers, the spirits just sent me

01:06:54.181 --> 01:06:56.216
one humdinger of a dream,

01:06:56.249 --> 01:06:57.450
oh, my goodness.

01:06:57.484 --> 01:06:59.186
I was dreaming of eating pudding,

01:06:59.219 --> 01:07:01.822
of course, but the pudding
looked like the Golden Dragon.

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:04.424
And you know what that
Golden Pudding Dragon said?

01:07:04.457 --> 01:07:06.827
He said, "Just listen to Wally

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.763
and fend for yourselves,

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:12.199
and then eat me, I'm a yummy pudding"

01:07:12.232 --> 01:07:14.134
or something like that, yeah.

01:07:16.469 --> 01:07:19.172
Ah, can I take one
teensy-eensy

01:07:19.206 --> 01:07:21.742
little catnap without the world ending?

01:07:21.775 --> 01:07:23.276
Fend for yourselves,

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.178
like the Golden Pudding Dragon said.

01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:27.380
I don't need a driving lesson right now.

01:07:27.414 --> 01:07:29.449
But you're driving like a cub scout.

01:07:31.719 --> 01:07:33.754
Move it, brothers.
Hurry up, move it.

01:07:35.122 --> 01:07:36.857
The gold, protect the gold.

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:39.392
I'm driving, you protect the gold.

01:07:39.426 --> 01:07:40.694
You can't just sit there and wait.

01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:42.395
Move it, move it.

01:07:42.429 --> 01:07:44.798
Ah, keep it moving, sweet cakes.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.721
What is it?

01:08:07.755 --> 01:08:10.724
You guys.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.576
My mother warned me.

01:08:30.578 --> 01:08:31.879
Oh.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.814
Look up in the sky, it's a bird.

01:08:34.848 --> 01:08:37.518
It's some kind of man-made
flying device.

01:08:37.551 --> 01:08:39.486
It's the Golden Dragon.

01:08:51.732 --> 01:08:54.466
The dragon saved us.

01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:07.848
We've just witnessed
an ancient prophecy come true.

01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:09.649
Wow.

01:09:09.683 --> 01:09:10.951
Heads up, guys, there's some kind

01:09:10.984 --> 01:09:13.554
of object at 12:00.

01:09:13.587 --> 01:09:16.423
There you are, you greedy worm.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:17.725
Wally, it's your body.

01:09:17.758 --> 01:09:19.760
Yeah. Ain't that something?

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:21.929
Hey, Wally?

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:23.330
Can you hear me?

01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:24.665
Wally.

01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:26.867
Stay with us, buddy,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:30.403
Stop, hold it, oh.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:39.546
Quick, run, run, run, run,

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:40.814
come on, come on, come on.

01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:44.685
Hang in there, Wally, okay,

01:09:44.718 --> 01:09:46.654
- we're coming.
- Coming up on your body, buddy.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.261
Activate.

01:09:54.294 --> 01:09:55.696
Now, back everyone, back.

01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:06.540
I don't understand.

01:10:06.574 --> 01:10:08.008
It should be activating.

01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:09.442
- What happens?
- Maybe it's the battery.

01:10:09.476 --> 01:10:10.611
The battery's fine.

01:10:10.644 --> 01:10:12.312
It just isn't working.

01:10:12.345 --> 01:10:13.814
Wally, we'll be right with you.

01:10:13.847 --> 01:10:14.948
Don't move.

01:10:14.982 --> 01:10:15.816
Nobody panic, just nobody panic.

01:10:15.849 --> 01:10:16.917
Just one minute.

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:18.919
- God, we don't have a minute.
- Everything is fine.

01:10:18.952 --> 01:10:20.621
Doohickey's intact.
Phase widget.

01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:22.422
- Beam gizmo?
- Ah, for the love of peace,

01:10:22.455 --> 01:10:23.557
just fix it.

01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:24.625
Get the heating pad.

01:10:24.658 --> 01:10:26.426
They got us for the day.

01:10:26.459 --> 01:10:27.728
Attach this to that...
Oh...

01:10:27.761 --> 01:10:28.729
It's...

01:10:28.762 --> 01:10:30.397
There's no time left,

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:31.498
this is it, guys.

01:10:31.532 --> 01:10:33.433
Holy carrot, come on.

01:10:33.466 --> 01:10:34.868
He's passing out.

01:10:34.902 --> 01:10:38.271
- Carlin, do something.
- Oh, I can't even watch this.

01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:39.673
What have we done wrong?

01:10:43.811 --> 01:10:46.313
Coming through.

01:11:30.123 --> 01:11:31.592
Look at you, guys.

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:33.360
What, is the sky falling?

01:11:35.395 --> 01:11:37.931
What, you act like you've never seen

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.933
a body-jacking
butterfly before?

01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:43.837
It's just like I could still
hear his voice.

01:11:43.871 --> 01:11:44.938
Can somebody tell me

01:11:44.972 --> 01:11:46.574
why I feel like I just got smacked

01:11:46.607 --> 01:11:48.075
on the head really hard by a bear?

01:11:51.579 --> 01:11:54.414
Boy, if that don't take the cake.

01:11:54.447 --> 01:11:55.415
Wally.

01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:04.925
We thought that you
had flown away forever.

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.894
Oh, no way.
Flying's for the birds.

01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:09.863
Son of a sheep.

01:12:14.635 --> 01:12:17.638
Look, I'm really sorry

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.372
I caused all this trouble.

01:12:21.942 --> 01:12:23.877
Which is never going to stop.

01:12:25.579 --> 01:12:29.049
Are you referring to this
worthless hunk of junk?

01:12:29.082 --> 01:12:30.851
The improve-riser?

01:12:30.884 --> 01:12:32.586
Oh, stop it.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.123
I thought that I had invented
something unique.

01:12:36.156 --> 01:12:39.426
But it turns out that there is
a little improve-riser

01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:42.029
inside every last one of us.

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.566
So Chiko can weed my tulip garden

01:12:45.599 --> 01:12:46.634
just as good as me?

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:47.735
Hallelujah.

01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:57.845
So, yeah, I'm just Wally,

01:12:57.878 --> 01:12:59.513
and I'll never be as clever

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:00.781
and nimble as Krash,

01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:02.482
or strong as Berry,

01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:04.552
or as smart as Dokko,

01:13:04.585 --> 01:13:06.153
but watch out world,

01:13:06.186 --> 01:13:07.855
machine or not,

01:13:07.888 --> 01:13:10.891
Wally the sheep
has been improve-rised

01:13:10.924 --> 01:13:12.926
and mutton's never gonna be

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.095
the same again.

01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:26.540
Nein, nein, nein,

01:13:26.574 --> 01:13:28.942
not now, you stupid wreck of metal.

01:13:28.976 --> 01:13:31.912
Relax, this hunk of metal is fine.

01:13:31.945 --> 01:13:34.481
< Thank you all >,
< for choosing > Fräulein < air >.

01:13:34.515 --> 01:13:36.584
Now, Pin, get to work.

01:13:36.617 --> 01:13:40.087
Ja, ja, tea, coffee, tea, coffee?

01:13:49.162 --> 01:13:52.099
Ugh, my mother warned me

01:13:52.132 --> 01:13:54.502
that you were the biggest dingbat

01:13:54.535 --> 01:13:57.871
in the long sad history of dingbats.

01:13:57.905 --> 01:13:59.039
How could you call me that?

01:13:59.072 --> 01:14:02.009
I'm the pretty one now.

01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:05.178
Thank you for making me
hate my own face.

01:14:05.212 --> 01:14:07.147
And that's mine,

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.817
King Dingbat.

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:12.753
Why didn't I listen to my mother?

01:14:12.786 --> 01:14:13.554
Huh?

01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:15.556
Well, technically, at this point,

01:14:15.589 --> 01:14:17.124
she's my mother.
