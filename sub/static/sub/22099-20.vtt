an even dozen.

You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution

00:54.638 --> 00:56.973

of 200 other people?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.975

This is a death warrant. Have
you seen the names on this list?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.522
Do you have any idea what
they're about to do out there?

01:04.606 --> 01:07.233
Gaius Baltar chose
to side with the Cylons

01:07.317 --> 01:10.570
and to actively seek the
deaths of his fellow citizens.

01:10.654 --> 01:14.490
Madam President, are you
taking chamalla at this time?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.243
Don't answer. I'm putting
a stop to this right now.

goes to her credibility as a witness.

I am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

a liar and a coward.

deserve a trial.

who questions my integrity.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.562
Quiet. The whole fleet
knows this man tried

15:38.646 --> 15:42.441
to stab me through the neck!
And you missed! Butterfingers!

15:43.234 --> 15:44.651
Sorry, Your Honors.
Shut up.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.528
No further questions.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.549

16:11.763 --> 16:13.055
No questions.

What?

16:14.349 --> 16:16.350
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

16:16.434 --> 16:17.768
What, are you...

16:17.852 --> 16:19.811
The witness is dismissed.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.396
BALTAR: Oh, great.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.067
BALTAR: What the hell
are you doing?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.818
Listen, it's your word
against his right now.

16:26.903 --> 16:30.489
If he's decided to perjure himself, there's
nothing we can do to change that now.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.699
We'll have to adjust
our strategy.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.594
Is the defense prepared
to present their case?

17:01.771 --> 17:02.938
Your Honors.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.692
At this time,
if it please the court,

17:08.653 --> 17:10.737
I would like
to offer a motion.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.782
The defense would like
to move for a mistrial.

17:13.866 --> 17:18.161
No! We do not want a mistrial!
I do not want a mistrial!

17:18.246 --> 17:19.705
Gaius Baltar!

17:20.957 --> 17:22.708
Behave, Dr. Baltar.

17:23.418 --> 17:24.918
On what grounds,
Counselor?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.714
On the grounds
that one of the panel

17:28.798 --> 17:33.802
has already prejudged the outcome of
this trial and determined the guilt

17:34.595 --> 17:36.221
of the defendant.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.349
ADAMA: That's a very serious
charge, Mr. Lampkin.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.476
Which judge?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.813
That would be you, Admiral.

17:47.316 --> 17:51.027
And to prove it, I need
to take the unusual step

17:51.112 --> 17:53.947
of calling Mr. Lee Adama
to the stand.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.199
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

17:57.660 --> 17:59.119
You've got to be
frakking kidding me.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.203
Gaeta sunk us.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.913
This is the only way
we're going to win.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.583
I will not testify
against my father.

18:04.792 --> 18:09.421
That is your choice. Either way,
I'm putting you on the stand.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.424
Your Honors.
This is completely improper.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.302
Counsel cannot testify at
trial under any circumstances.

18:15.386 --> 18:19.097
I can cite at least seven
precedents off the top of my head.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.272
Call your witness, Counselor.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.732
Thank you.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.860
Mr. Adama.

18:48.336 --> 18:54.800
Mr. Adama, did you meet with your
father, Admiral Adama, four days ago?

19:00.264 --> 19:01.264
Yes.

19:01.891 --> 19:06.311
At that meeting, did Admiral
Adama express an opinion

19:06.395 --> 19:10.190
as to whether the defendant
deserved a trial?

19:15.571 --> 19:20.534
All I'm looking for is the truth,
here, Mr. Adama. Let's have it.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.579
I'm waiting.
Answer the question.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.752
You swore an oath
as an officer of the court.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.589
If you don't answer the question, you
hold the entire system of justice...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.007
What frakking system?

19:36.092 --> 19:37.175
Mr. Adama!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.890
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.142
Please excuse my associate.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.440
All right, all right.
I'll try something else.

19:56.571 --> 20:00.949
Do you believe that the
defendant deserves a fair trial?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.127
As a matter of fact, I do.
Why?

20:12.211 --> 20:15.171
Well, aside from the fact that
everyone deserves a fair trial,

20:15.256 --> 20:17.382
I also happen to believe that
he is not guilty of the charges

20:17.466 --> 20:18.508
and should be acquitted.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.136
Your Honors, I must insist
on an exception here!

20:21.220 --> 20:23.889
He cannot testify in this
manner. It's completely improper.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.724
I agree. He can make his arguments

20:25.808 --> 20:28.059
in closing statements,
not on the stand.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.103
I'm inclined to
agree with the prosecution.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.980
CASSIDY: Thank you.

20:32.148 --> 20:36.359
You can appeal to the President if you
feel that this influences the verdict.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.986
But I, for one,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.990
would like to hear
this witness testify.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.326
MALE JUDGE:
I would second that.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.203
Continue.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.205
Thank you, Your Honors.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.042
Mr. Adama?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.169
Mr. Adama!

20:54.253 --> 20:55.378
Yes?

20:57.465 --> 21:03.178
Why do you believe that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar, deserves to be acquitted?

21:06.557 --> 21:10.101
Well, because the evidence
does not support the charges.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.937
Come on.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.149
Did the defendant
make mistakes?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.027
Sure. He did.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.947
Serious mistakes. But did he
actually commit any crimes?

21:22.031 --> 21:24.032
Did he commit treason? No.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.745
I mean, it was
an impossible situation.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.872
When the Cylons arrived,
what could he possibly do?

21:30.957 --> 21:33.083
What could anyone have done?

21:33.376 --> 21:36.419
I mean, ask yourself.
What would you have done?

21:36.671 --> 21:38.713
What would you have done?

21:40.341 --> 21:42.717
If he had refused to surrender,
the Cylons would have probably

21:42.802 --> 21:45.011
nuked the planet
right then and there.

21:45.096 --> 21:48.098
So, did he appear to cooperate
with the Cylons? Sure.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.143
So did hundreds of others.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.314
What's the difference
between him and them?

21:59.068 --> 22:02.112
The President issued
a blanket pardon.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.990
They were all forgiven.
No questions asked.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.492
Colonel Tigh.

22:08.411 --> 22:12.747
Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers
and killed dozens of people. Forgiven.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.542
Lieutenant Agathon
and Chief Tyrol.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.837
They murdered an officer
on the Pegasus. Forgiven.

22:18.921 --> 22:22.340
The Admiral... The Admiral
instituted a military coup d'etat

22:22.425 --> 22:24.384
against the President.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.177
Forgiven.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.930
And me?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.225
Well...

22:32.309 --> 22:34.102
Where do I begin?

22:37.898 --> 22:40.483
I shot down
a civilian passenger ship.

22:40.943 --> 22:44.696
The Olympic Carrier. Over a
thousand people on board. Forgiven.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.032
I raised my weapon
to a superior officer.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.492
Committed an act
of mutiny. Forgiven.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.871
And then, on the very day when
Baltar surrendered to those Cylons,

22:52.955 --> 22:55.081
I, as commander of the
Pegasus, jumped away!

22:55.166 --> 22:59.044
I left everybody on that planet,
alone, undefended, for months!

22:59.628 --> 23:03.048
I even tried to persuade
the Admiral never to return.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.925
To abandon you all
there for good.

23:06.302 --> 23:10.096
If I'd had my way, nobody would
have made it off that planet.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.641
I'm the coward.
I'm the traitor.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.603
I'm forgiven.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.900
I'd say we're very
forgiving of mistakes.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.570
We make our own laws now,
our own justice,

23:25.654 --> 23:28.531
and we've been pretty creative at
finding ways to let people off the hook

23:28.616 --> 23:30.909
for everything
from theft to murder.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.495
And we've had to be.
Because...

23:34.663 --> 23:37.499
Because we're not
a civilization anymore.

23:37.583 --> 23:41.211
We are a gang.
And we're on the run.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.923
And we have to fight to
survive! We have to break rules!

23:45.007 --> 23:48.051
We have to bend laws!
We have to improvise!

23:50.346 --> 23:52.222
But not this time. No.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.682
Not this time.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.352
Not for Gaius Baltar.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.562
No. You!

24:00.231 --> 24:01.606
You have to die.

24:01.690 --> 24:06.236
You have to die because, well,
because we don't like you very much.

24:06.904 --> 24:10.031
Because you're arrogant.
Because you're weak.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.075
Because you're a coward.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.495
And we, the mob, we want
to throw you out the airlock

24:15.579 --> 24:19.082
because you didn't stand up to the Cylons
and get yourself killed in the process!

24:19.166 --> 24:20.917
That's justice now!

24:21.544 --> 24:23.795
You should have been killed
back on New Caprica,

24:23.879 --> 24:26.965
but since you had the temerity to
live, we're going to execute you now!

24:27.049 --> 24:28.550
That's justice!

Order. Order!

24:43.315 --> 24:45.066
This case...

24:46.152 --> 24:49.404
This case is built
on emotion. On anger.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.657
Bitterness. Vengeance.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.577
But most of all,
it is built on shame.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.413
It's about the shame

24:58.873 --> 25:02.125
of what we did to ourselves
back on that planet.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.753
And it's about the guilt

25:06.130 --> 25:09.132
of those of us who ran away.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.969
Who ran away.

25:16.098 --> 25:20.685
And we are trying to dump all that
guilt and all that shame onto one man,

25:21.061 --> 25:22.812
and then flush him
out the airlock

25:22.897 --> 25:25.732
and hope that,
that just gets rid of it all!

25:26.775 --> 25:28.943
So that we can
live with ourselves.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.363
But that won't work.

That won't work.
That's not justice.

for defense counsel.

like to make one thing clear.

27:24.101 --> 27:28.438
Like everything human,
justice is imperfect.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.232
It's flawed.

very imperfections

that separates us
from the machines.

going to be acquitted.

innocent shouldn't disguise in any way

that if there was a way to demonstrate

the sheer... What's the
word I'm looking for?

29:18.674 --> 29:21.717
"Hypocrisy. " "Hypocrisy" is
the word I'm looking for.

Hypocrisy of
the prosecution's case,

29:23.429 --> 29:27.723
then, really, the judges had no other
option but to find me not guilty.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.435
Well, your boundless confidence
provided us with great solace

29:30.519 --> 29:31.602
throughout the proceedings.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.021
Look, I want to
thank you both.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.273
Truly.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.317
From the bottom of my heart.
I am very, very grateful

29:38.402 --> 29:40.319
for all you've done.

29:40.571 --> 29:44.615
On a personal note, if I could have seen
the Admiral squirm just a little bit more,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.368
it wouldn't have hurt.
Now, you listen!

29:51.957 --> 29:53.875
Don't push it, Doctor.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.545
Fine.

29:59.047 --> 30:02.216
Romo, perhaps
we could have a chat.

30:03.051 --> 30:06.596
I've thought about maybe doing
a book tour around the fleet.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.432
And there's the publishing rights.
There are issues about my security,

30:09.516 --> 30:11.392
where I'm going to live,
what I'm going to do.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.479
Since we forged this great
relationship during the trial,

30:14.563 --> 30:17.523
I thought, you know, who
better to... Think about...

30:17.608 --> 30:21.694
Actually, now that the fleet's
legal system is in place,

30:21.778 --> 30:25.656
my not-so-inconsiderable
talents are required elsewhere.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.744
So, I'm afraid this is
the end of our journey.

30:30.621 --> 30:34.707
What? Wait a minute. What...
What about me?

30:35.417 --> 30:37.376
Wait a minute.
Wait. Please.

for a second.

What am I going to do?

30:44.551 --> 30:46.260

a cat metaphor, Doctor,

on your feet.
