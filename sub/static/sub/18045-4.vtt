WEBVTT

00:28.320 --> 00:29.238
Huh.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.880
Huh.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.682
<i>Hey, it's Luke. Leave a message.</i>

00:56.765 --> 00:57.975
Hey, it's me.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.893
I'm standing here in my lovely motel room

00:59.977 --> 01:04.397
in its various shades of orange,
and brown and... DNA samples.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.985
I figure as long as I don't break out
the black light, I'll be fine.

01:08.611 --> 01:11.488
The ice machine is next door.
I've appointed myself ice monitor.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.074
Thank you.
There will be a badge and a hat.

01:14.992 --> 01:20.205
I figure I'll hear people trying
to get ice and I can interrogate them.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.875
What do they need the ice for?
How much do they need?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.459
What shape's their bucket in?

01:24.876 --> 01:28.422
Basically, I've been alone
for exactly 12 hours, and I'm already nuts.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.759
So, I thought I would check in
and let you know I got here.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.178
Getting my pack ready, and...
How important is food on a hiking trip?

01:35.262 --> 01:38.056
Aren't all parts of the pine tree edible?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.433
I should get to bed.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.561
I'm hitting the trail really early
in the morning.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.356
Hitting the trail.
That's hiking lingo.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.734
So... I'll keep you posted.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.948
Crap.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.254
No, no, no! No, no, no!
I will not... win!

02:15.260 --> 02:17.554
Yes! Yeah!

02:18.471 --> 02:20.683
Yeah!

02:22.184 --> 02:25.520
No! No!
No, no, no, no, no!

02:25.603 --> 02:28.398
No, no, no, no!

02:29.566 --> 02:31.068
Hey, what do you need that ice for?

02:34.529 --> 02:36.699
Feet. So many feet.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.043
Shoot.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.647
This would be great
with calliope music playing.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.026
No one's getting out
of this one, boys.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.594
- What's the holdup?
- I don't know.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.556
- I'm reapplying.
- You just put that sunscreen on.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.891
Give me some.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.976
I brought extra boots
to toss over the side.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.644
-Oh, just like Reese.
-Just like Reese.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.730
- Book or movie?
- I'm sorry?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.065
Which one are you? Book or movie?
They're movie.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.442
-Oh. Uh... book. I am book.
-We're book, too.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.153
-You want sunscreen?
-No, I'm good.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.780
-Are you just starting?
-Yes.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.281
Me, too. So excited.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.200
I've been planning this for a year.
Since my divorce.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.453
Since my mother died. And my divorce.
And what about you?

04:05.537 --> 04:06.747
-I--
-Book or movie?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.623
- Book.
- Oh.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.625
- Excuse me. Book or movie?
- Movie!

04:10.708 --> 04:11.960
Me, too!

04:12.044 --> 04:13.295
Wow. What's she?
Off-Broadway?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.712
That's the thru-hiker.

04:14.796 --> 04:18.300
She's doing the entire
Pacific Crest Trail. All 2,650 miles.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.552
-Holy hell.
-Takes over six months.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.262
-Of being dressed like this?
-Yep.

04:22.345 --> 04:26.058
I tried talking to her last night.
She just looks right through you.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.269
Somebody told me she's a crazy heiress
who does nothing but hike.

04:29.352 --> 04:33.315
Someone told me she lost two toes
during a freak snow storm.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.026
Okay. Can I get the attention
of the <i>Wild</i> ladies?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.195
-Movie or book?
-It actually doesn't matter.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.404
It matters to us.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.575
There's a storm coming in tonight.
It's going to be rough conditions.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.161
Now, all of you have permits
and nice big backpacks,

04:46.244 --> 04:49.957
so you are welcome to begin your hikes,
but it will be a brutal first day.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.168
The visibility for boot-throwing
will be very bad,

04:53.251 --> 04:55.545
so you may want
to consider starting tomorrow.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.798
Now, for those of you who will not be dead

04:57.881 --> 04:59.883
within 20 minutes of exposure
to the elements,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.385
have your storm gear ready
and available to you.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.636
And good hiking!

05:03.720 --> 05:05.513
It doesn't even matter now.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.516
-Think I'm going to wait.
-Me, too. You?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.894
I guess. Although I'm afraid
this thing is like shoes.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.688
You take it off, you swell up,
you can't get it back on again.

05:16.358 --> 05:20.946
Uh, yo, books don't throw boots.
Respect the book.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.866
-Shoelaces are untied.
-Huh? Oh, crap.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.663
You'll do great out there.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.953
Hey, guys, you don't need to lock
every lock when you're in here.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.413
This isn't an Italian social club.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.582
Well... well Bernie wanted it locked
at all times.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.543
Well, Bernie's not here.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.046
-If you'd just let us arm ourselves.
-No guns!

06:19.129 --> 06:22.007
Now, for the next issue,
we're going to go with the poem--

06:22.090 --> 06:24.842
-The fall poem?
-Yes. The fall poem.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.553
I told you people like the poem.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.140
- Yes. The poem is terrific.
- Okay, so...

06:32.142 --> 06:33.893
As you were.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.524
Charlie?

06:40.108 --> 06:42.569
Did you accidentally fall asleep
writing an e-mail again?

06:43.153 --> 06:45.947
Well, no, I... I had coffee this morning.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.242
-Esther?
-I'm filing.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.954
I was at the filing cabinet.
You know what that entails.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.164
Oh. Okay, but...

07:00.128 --> 07:01.754
Hey, did you guys see that?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.674
-See what?
-I'm just trying to file here.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.593
There was a message on the pig.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.011
The pig?

07:08.720 --> 07:09.846
Should I come over?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
No. Never mind.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.273
Luke?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.863
Luke?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
Seriously, Luke!

07:33.495 --> 07:35.663
Luke, you back there?

07:35.747 --> 07:39.459
Jeez. Ah. There's... Uh, hi.

07:39.542 --> 07:44.047
There's flour. Caesar, the flour broke.
Bag... The flour bag broke.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.885
Jess, hey. Is it four o'clock?
Yeah, it's four o'clock.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.303
It's four o'clock.

07:50.387 --> 07:54.224
-Lucy Ricardo stumbling out next?
-I broke a bag of flour. It moves.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.767
Yes. Flour moves.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.602
-Hey, what is going on out here?
-Where?

07:57.685 --> 07:58.686
Diner of the dead.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.356
Oh, yeah, some jackass asked me
for the Wi-Fi password

08:01.439 --> 08:03.150
and a bigger jackass gave it to him.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.735
You didn't give me that password
for six months and I lived here.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.988
Well, you didn't catch
my big Dumb-Ass Day.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.114
Luke, pick up!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.658
Okay.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.368
- Whoa!
- What?

08:13.451 --> 08:15.286
- Wrong way.
- I got it.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.413
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.040
-You sure?
-Yeah. Sure.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.085
-What is this?
-One bagel split four ways.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.005
Oh, Jesus. God.
I hate laptoppers.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.091
- Why don't you kick 'em out?
- I didn't have to kick 'em out.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.803
I had a perfect system. No password.
And then they'd leave on their own.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.056
Now they sit around for hours
catching old episodes of <i>Doctor Who</i>.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.308
I'll see you in an hour.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.143
We're off the hook for this thing tonight.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.227
What thing?

08:39.311 --> 08:42.397
We were going to Liz and T.J.'s,
to chase off the vegetable cult?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.274
-Right.
-Turns out the vegetable cult thought

08:44.357 --> 08:46.818
Mom and T.J. were too weird
and kicked them out.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.696
-I see their point.
-We could still grab some food later...

08:49.779 --> 08:52.907
-unless you're fighting the baking soda.
-Hilarious.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.701
So, I'll come by... around 8:00?

08:54.784 --> 08:57.412
Great. And then we'll go
to Liz and T.J.'s after?

09:02.167 --> 09:03.168
Luke, what's up?

09:04.169 --> 09:06.963
Nothing. No, I...
You know, I'm just a little tired.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.423
I just need some sleep. That's all.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.800
-Everything okay at home?
-Fine.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.594
-Fine.
-Yes.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.845
Fine, fine.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.389
No. Yes, yes, fine.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.100
What're you doing?
Whoa, whoa.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.517
Hey, hey. I got work to do, man.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.478
Come on.
You're the owner. Take a break.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.605
There you go. Sit.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.860
So, you wanna talk
about what's going on with you?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.403
Nope.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.364
Okay.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.285
Lorelai's doing <i>Wild.</i>

09:37.785 --> 09:40.955
Movie or book?
Very different experiences.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.374
-Book.
-A purist.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.750
Go on.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.379
She's just, uh...
well, she's doing <i>Wild.</i>

09:47.462 --> 09:50.090
Out there. She got on a plane
and flew off to California

09:50.173 --> 09:52.425
-and bought some hiking boots.
-Cute hiking boots?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.802
No, the real hiking boots
that you can hike in.

09:54.886 --> 09:58.431
And this is after we...
You know, there's been some, uh...

09:59.516 --> 10:02.102
Between us, it's been...

10:02.185 --> 10:03.770
Communication problems?

10:03.853 --> 10:06.481
-Exactly.
-Never experienced that myself.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.732
Maybe she wanted a vacation.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.152
-Yeah, from me. From us.
-No. No.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.195
Uh, she's been keeping things from me.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.364
-Guy things?
-No. Other things.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.658
Like, she's been...

10:17.575 --> 10:20.537
she's been going to a therapist.
Do not say, "It's about time."

10:20.620 --> 10:23.581
I did not say it. I thought it,
but that's the way my mind works.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.000
Ah, we've been arguing, like sniping.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.170
And, we never sniped, you know.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.338
We never picked at each other in public

10:30.422 --> 10:33.466
and put each other down
and made other people look at us like,

10:33.550 --> 10:34.592
"Oops, what's going on?"

10:34.676 --> 10:38.471
-I don't like you using the word "oops."
-I don't like me using it either.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.764
I never used the word before.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.392
Now I'm a guy who snipes at his girl
and uses the word "oops."

10:42.475 --> 10:44.186
Well, when does she get back?

10:44.269 --> 10:48.148
Three weeks. It's the longest
we've been apart since we got together.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.816
You might be wrong.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.527
-You think I'm wrong?
-Hey, I'm just hearing headlines.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.280
Lorelai Gilmore decides to hike
the Pacific Crest Trail

10:55.363 --> 10:57.782
to figure some things out.
What's that sound like?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.370
-It sounds like she's leaving you.
-Yeah.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.542
Yeah.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.254
I gotta get back to work.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.882
Can I get a coffee?

11:14.966 --> 11:17.510
-Yeah. You want food with that?
-Nope, just the coffee.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.222
- That's it.
- Just the coffee.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.639
Just the coffee.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.811
Merry Christmas.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.605
Oh, man. Bogus.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.900
When are we gonna get a Starbucks?

11:34.944 --> 11:35.945
Hmm.

11:40.074 --> 11:44.078
Oh, come on... something about this trip
has gotta be fun.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.707
Sticking... sticking to the roof...

12:11.648 --> 12:14.276
<i>Dear Paul,</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:17.236
<i>I woke up this morning</i>
<i>and I wrote your name in the sand.</i>

12:17.320 --> 12:19.406
Hey. Come join us.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.283
What's up, ladies?

12:21.366 --> 12:23.368
It just got so boring
in that room.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.453
And there's nothing good to watch on TV.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.665
-And the drapes smell funny.
-And I'm afraid of my pack.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.959
I think it's gonna come to life
in the night and kill me.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.544
You should have paid more
for the non-homicidal one.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.879
It came with a mini flashlight.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.424
We're gonna be alone for weeks
with no one to talk to,

12:37.507 --> 12:40.843
so we figured let's just
get it all out now. Box wine?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.053
Sure.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.889
-Trader Joe's. Three for ten bucks.
-Score.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.685
I thought boxes would be lighter.
You're not supposed to bring bottles.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.102
-What's your contraband?
-What?

12:50.186 --> 12:51.896
What did you bring
that you shouldn't have?

12:51.979 --> 12:54.982
-I brought a mirror and nail polish.
-I brought a ham.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.696
Oh, um, well I brought the key
to my storage closet,

12:59.779 --> 13:02.865
so if Michel needs a toner cartridge,
he'll have to go to Staples.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.867
I am so glad I'm doing this.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.537
I almost did <i>Eat, Pray, Love,</i>
but my miles were blacked out.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.621
So, here I am.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.999
The Lean Cuisines are ready.
Come and get 'em.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.293
I brought SnackWells
and VitaTops for dessert.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.505
Wow, you guys came prepared.
Not for hiking, but prepared.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.173
So, what's your story?

13:19.257 --> 13:21.884
Oh, no story. Just a punch line.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.845
Well, who are you?
Where are you from?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.682
My name is Lorelai Gilmore, and I am
from a little town in Connecticut.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.058
-Are you married?
-No.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.102
That's why she's here.
I said you were divorced.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.395
Oh, no, I'm not divorced.

13:32.479 --> 13:36.023
I am divorced, but not from the guy
I'm currently with. We just...

13:36.107 --> 13:37.817
We live together.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.943
-And he cheats.
-No.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.027
-You cheat.
-No.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.946
He's dumb, and he drinks, and he smells.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.114
Man, I can really pick 'em.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.658
- Well?
- No. He's a good guy.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.952
-Are your kids terrible?
-We don't know if she has kids.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.370
I have a daughter. She's amazing.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.456
-So, you're addicted to Vicodin.
-No.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.833
Heroin? I've heard
it's the big housewife drug now.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.710
How would you even get heroin?

13:55.793 --> 13:58.045
They sell it behind the Olive Garden
down the street.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.922
I'm going to make some French bread pizza.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.007
- Takers?
- Sure.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.299
Me!

14:02.384 --> 14:06.303
God, I hope this hike works.
I need a new life so badly.

14:06.388 --> 14:11.225
Me, too. I can't imagine waking up
like this anymore. I need some clarity.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.852
Insight.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.855
I've waited my whole life
to have insight, you know?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.858
Well, I always thought
I had insight.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.319
I thought I knew exactly what I wanted,
where I was going,

14:22.404 --> 14:26.073
what I was doing and why I was doing it.
I was so sure.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.619
But, lately, I don't know,
things seem hazier.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.954
Plus, there's the clocks ticking,

14:32.038 --> 14:34.331
and the milestones looming
and there's Luke.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.252
Suddenly, I feel like I'm standing still.

14:39.170 --> 14:43.758
Like the whole world is moving...
and I'm standing completely still.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.847
Boy, we're gonna need another box.

15:20.962 --> 15:24.882
"By the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes."

15:27.301 --> 15:29.345
Rory. Rory.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.601
Get ready, Rory.
Get ready, Rory.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.060
What the...

15:44.694 --> 15:46.028
Hello?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.198
Is anyone here?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.078
Hello?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.374
<i>In omnia paratus.</i>

15:58.458 --> 16:00.543
-What?
-Didn't I say that right?

16:01.503 --> 16:03.045
Yep. That's it.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.148
Well, I'll be damned.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.236
Are you gentlemen lost?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.614
- Gentlemen?
- I'm offended.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.825
Are we going to take that?
Letting this girl call us gentlemen?

16:32.909 --> 16:34.243
Take the masks off.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.038
My dear lady,
you do not ask a man to drop his facade.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.665
Not without a 20 in your hand, anyhow.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.126
-What are you guys doing here?
-She speaks to us as if she knows us.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.920
As if she has intimate knowledge of us.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.463
How was your knee surgery, Colin?

16:45.547 --> 16:48.257
Every single nurse was a man.
When did that happen?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.676
So, let's have a look at you here.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.512
- She seems pale.
- I'm always pale.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.140
-She seems sadly dressed for the fields.
-Or riding in boxcars.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.350
Or perhaps she's passing
herself off as a boy.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.645
-Like Yentl.
-Tell me, girl, are you Yentl?

17:00.728 --> 17:02.063
Well, it is Friday, so...

17:02.146 --> 17:04.106
Men, I believe we've arrived just in time.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.233
-Time for what?
-"Time for what?" she asks.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.277
Ah, the female sex.
They do ask questions.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.029
There was a meeting, my darling.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.405
-A meeting?
-A convocation.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.949
- An assemblage.
- A conclave.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.659
- A parley.
- A hen party.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.743
There was scotch.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.954
After discussing the minutes
from the last meeting

17:18.037 --> 17:19.580
and the minutes
we took in this meeting

17:19.664 --> 17:21.582
discussing the minutes
from the last meeting...

17:21.666 --> 17:23.167
-There was a lot of scotch.
-We voted.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.460
And we decided...

17:26.546 --> 17:28.548
that we had to come and take you out.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.498
<i>It's an omen.</i>

18:46.458 --> 18:48.795
<i>- Petal, no!</i>

18:48.878 --> 18:50.421
- Superb!
- A lost classic.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.257
- Another <i>La Dolce Vita.</i>
- They're remaking it with Gosling.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.259
First <i>Arthur,</i> now this. They never learn.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.636
Cheers!

18:56.719 --> 18:59.305
- What time is it?
- Time is but a relative concept.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.931
- 10:15.
- Time to hit the road.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.877
- Wanna try that?
- Hell no.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.743
Cigars, cigarillos, e-cigs, vapes.

20:43.826 --> 20:48.205
Cigars, cigarillos, e-cigs, vapes.
Cigars, cigarillos...

20:48.289 --> 20:49.498
Another bottle.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.835
My mother taught me to only drink
very expensive champagne.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.546
That's funny.
Your mother taught me the same thing.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.882
Don't they ever play
any other kind of music?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.342
In a tango club? No.
They tend to stay on message.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.471
-It's extremely irritating.
-You need to learn to enjoy things more.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.638
Why's the waitress sitting?

21:04.722 --> 21:07.600
This is not the waitress.
This is my newly minted fiancée.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.811
-What is your name, sweetheart?
-Doris.

21:09.894 --> 21:10.937
We can fix that.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.148
It's nice to meet you, Doris.
Check your wallet before you leave.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.151
I'm bored.
I think I'm going to buy the club.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.946
Martini, darling.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.323
Two olives.
And for the love of God, hurry back.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.451
-Finn, isn't that a guy?
-Only till next Tuesday.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.515
How's your foot?

21:48.599 --> 21:51.352
- I do not think it's broken.
- Well, good.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.562
-You're still a terrible dancer.
-Agreed.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.814
But damn, you are a beauty.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.566
-Save the sweet talk, Huntzberger.
-Well, you are.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.861
- I'm not going Dutch, so...
- Rats.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.241
-Glad I came?
-Why did you come?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.536
-Well, it was my turn to walk Finn.
-Sure.

22:08.619 --> 22:12.164
-I did not like the way we left things.
-Yeah. Me neither.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.041
I should've told you
about Odette moving in.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.004
-Nope. That was not the agreement.
-I know.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.088
You owed me nothing.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.673
-Technically no, but--
-No strings.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.510
When we're together, we're together.
When we're not, we're not.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.637
So, how are you?

22:26.720 --> 22:28.556
Oh, well, I'm okay.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.141
Did you fix things with Lorelai?

22:30.224 --> 22:32.809
Not yet.
I've been crashing at Lane's.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.479
-No word from her at all?
-Nope.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.690
-What time is it?
-Why? You bored?

22:38.774 --> 22:42.486
One thing I can honestly say,
I've never been bored with you.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.988
Yeah. We're good like that.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.244
I have something for you.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.079
What is that?

22:52.955 --> 22:54.916
-That is a key.
-To?

22:54.999 --> 22:58.044
To... my family's house in Maine.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.171
It's a great place.
Private, on the water.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.964
It's empty. No one ever uses it.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.758
My dad only bought it
because Martha Stewart wanted it.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.718
They had a business thing fall through.
He was pissed.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.138
Wow,
your family life's different.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.222
It's yours.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.101
Um... you're giving me a house?

23:14.685 --> 23:16.103
It's yours to use.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.689
-To write that book.
-What?

23:18.772 --> 23:20.774
Go stay as long as you want.
Just work.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.026
Logan...

23:22.109 --> 23:23.986
There's a groundskeeper.
He'll look after you.

23:24.070 --> 23:28.032
The cleaning lady comes twice a week.
She'll cook for you. She'll shop for you.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.741
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.160
You need to do this.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.828
Write this book.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.246
It's time.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.459
Please. Take the key.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.384
Are you really gonna marry Odette?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.013
That's the dynastic plan.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.141
Out of the way.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.393
You two, scram.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.854
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've purchased this fine establishment,

23:58.937 --> 24:03.275
and as owner, I've decided
that the only music we'll play is this.

24:06.112 --> 24:10.866
Yes! All Rosemary Clooney all the time.
Try tangoing to that, huh?

24:10.949 --> 24:12.493
Money is great.

24:21.918 --> 24:22.961
Gentlemen, this is a raid.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.547
Send out your women, children,
hounds and horses.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.632
Finn! Shh.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.884
I won't be shushed
with horses and hounds at stake.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.554
Could this place be any more British?
I bet they have Hugh Grant in a closet.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.057
I hope they have rooms.
Is anyone working here?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.850
Oh, God, Princess Diana.
Of course.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.395
-Your Highness.
-Maybe we should go someplace else.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.188
-Hey, where are we?
-New Hampshire.

24:41.272 --> 24:44.150
New Hampshire?
How did we get to New Hampshire?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.318
Turned right at Vermont.
I'm starving.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.655
-I don't think they're open.
-They're not. We bought the place out.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.323
-What?
-Every room. It's just us.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.409
And all this lovely booze.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.287
Hello, darling.
What's your name?

24:56.370 --> 24:58.372
You have officially thought of everything.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.041
Except food.
There's no food.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.502
-Hmm. Darling, where's the rest of you?
-Stop taunting the heads, Finn.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.629
-I wonder if there's a kitchen.
-Try the back.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.506
-You coming, Finn?
-Right behind you.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.175
I know there's a picture of Mr. Bean
around here somewhere.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.387
-So... here.
-Wow. More keys.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.305
I didn't know where we stood.
I got you a room.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.183
Oh...
Well, where's your room?

25:18.267 --> 25:19.810
Uh, right across from yours.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.106
Show me.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.238
Ha! Found it.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.117
I wonder how much this place costs.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.578
Okay.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.666
I got your call of the wild
right here, pal.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.173
Yeah.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.844
-Hey, Brenda.
-Hey, Lorelai.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.721
-Hey, Tracey.
-Hey, Lorelai.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.390
-Allie, thanks for the tape.
-Oh, you're welcome.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.736
Hey.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.490
How long have you been sitting there?

26:16.492 --> 26:18.202
Just watching the sun come up.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.829
Come back to bed.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.250
How long before you have to get back?

26:26.168 --> 26:27.753
Oh, I have time.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.047
-How long?
-Long enough.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.302
I have a flight out at noon.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.431
-Don't do the math.
-Someone needs to.

26:40.974 --> 26:45.020
Okay, so there's this great diner
down the road.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.274
It's not your beloved Luke's,
but it has an amazing breakfast.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.067
It's really pretty here.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.779
-Well, I wanted it to be special.
-It was.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.781
It was a perfect night.

26:57.949 --> 26:58.950
Hey, Ace?

27:00.076 --> 27:01.953
Something going on in that head of yours?

27:06.292 --> 27:07.376
Here.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.253
No, no. I told you.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.547
It's yours. Use it to write.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.969
I don't need it.
I know where I'm going to write.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.597
Okay.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.476
Breakfast sounds good.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.895
- Hey...
- Come on.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.605
We have to get you home.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.368
There they are.
Breakfast martinis, children?

27:41.452 --> 27:43.204
-No, thank you.
-It can only help.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.413
I'll have one.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.832
-What happened to you?
-Ask him.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.042
-Did you hit Robert?
-I have no idea.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.587
- He has a very good idea.
- Actually, I do.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.755
My fist is showing
signs of an altercation,

27:53.839 --> 27:56.258
but the memory of
the actual assault is... gone.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.759
I said he was from New Zealand.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.053
Only a man with no heart
would say that to me.

28:00.136 --> 28:03.139
Did I buy a tango club last night
and a 1983 Dodge Colt?

28:03.224 --> 28:06.518
-I did not know about the Colt.
-Damn. My fourth Colt this month.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.770
-Mother is judging us.
-No, she's not.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.106
Yes, she is. Let me see your eye.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.859
-It looks fine.
-Good.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.238
-I'll take this medium rare.
-You'll have to cook your own steak.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.948
Well, boys, my car is almost here.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.492
- What?
- We have a car.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.952
-Two actually, if the Colt runs.
-No. I got my own car.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.079
I need to get back.
I need to get started.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.499
No, no, no.
We had a whole morning planned.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.627
Uh... no one's naked yet.
You can't just rush off like this.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.961
Logan, tell her!

28:33.044 --> 28:35.088
I don't think she's listening
to me anymore.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.924
But... when will we see you again?

28:38.008 --> 28:40.261
- I don't know.
- Oh, this is it?

28:40.344 --> 28:43.555
This is goodbye? No.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.268
-We love you, Rory.
-I love you all, too.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.936
Oh, Robert, don't cry.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.565
Your eye will swell up terribly.
Here... take your steak.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.859
Now I know I have a heart...

28:56.777 --> 28:58.237
'cause it's breaking.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.532
Goodbye, Colin.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.742
I'm going to miss
the way that you get drunk

29:03.825 --> 29:07.162
and randomly buy things you don't need,
like clubs and cars...

29:07.246 --> 29:10.165
And bed and breakfasts?
Oh, yeah.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.501
Oh, Colin.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.879
I think I'll miss you most of all.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.089
-Hey, we heard that.
-Yeah. Thanks a lot.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.926
Stay photogenic, I beg of you.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.431
- We'll meet you at the diner.
- Logan has the keys.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.516
-Well then, we'll walk.
-Will we?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.060
How novel.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.230
So this is walking?
I don't care for it actually.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.734
-Sure you don't want breakfast?
-I'm sure.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.611
-I'd like to drive you back.
-I know.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.697
-I dragged you out here...
-You didn't drag me.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
You took me on my own
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.326
How many girls can say that?

29:46.242 --> 29:49.455
-Didn't work though, did it?
-Every ride has to end.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.916
Okay.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.836
So...

29:57.128 --> 29:58.339
let's do this.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.765
If you change your mind
about the house, it's yours.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.266
No strings attached.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.811
I think your days of rescuing me are over.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.146
You never needed rescuing, Ace.
You know that.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.148
I do now.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.835
Yeah, just like that.

30:50.807 --> 30:54.936
-I heard she hasn't slept since Oregon.
-Nobody's ever seen her eat.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.397
Someone said she punched a bear.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.899
I eat. I sleep.
My name's Carol. I'm a lawyer.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.402
I have two kids, both grown.
I have all my toes.

31:01.485 --> 31:05.030
And I didn't punch a bear.
It was a possum, and he had it coming.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.457
Good morning, everybody.
The weather is beautiful today.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.668
You should have no problem in that area.

31:17.751 --> 31:19.836
However, there is still a high probability

31:19.920 --> 31:23.590
that any outdoor activity motivated
by watching a movie...

31:23.674 --> 31:27.218
is probably going to end
in some sort of hospitalization.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.304
Just putting that out there.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.724
Oh, screw this guy.
I am the book, damn it!

31:32.808 --> 31:35.018
- You good on sunscreen?
- I'm good.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.229
When this is over,
I'm gonna be so thin!

31:38.313 --> 31:41.357
-Allie, wait!
-Cannot afford to slow down. Bye, Lorelai!

31:41.441 --> 31:42.692
Bye, Tracey! Bye, Allie!

31:42.776 --> 31:44.986
Send me pictures
of that crazy town of yours!

31:45.070 --> 31:46.112
I'll do that!

31:48.114 --> 31:49.866
-Hi there.
-Uh... just need your permit.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.702
Oh. Hold, please.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.204
I thought I put it in my pocket.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.708
I usually...
well, I don't usually do any of this.

31:57.791 --> 32:00.669
I mean, who does?
Unless you're on the lam. Which I am not.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.004
Oh, I have a permit.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.090
-I showed your friend yesterday.
-What friend?

32:05.173 --> 32:08.427
-The guy who was here dressed like you.
-He's not my friend.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.012
So he's just a rival ranger
who stole your pants?

32:11.096 --> 32:13.389
He did not steal my pants.
He wore his own pants.

32:13.474 --> 32:15.016
Every ranger wears the same pants.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.435
-I'm sure you know him.
-Nope.

32:16.518 --> 32:17.727
Brown hair, disdainful voice?

32:17.811 --> 32:20.396
-You must've seen him in the clubhouse.
-We don't have one.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.815
You should have a clubhouse.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.026
-Your permit?
-Uh, is there a list? I'd be on it.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.111
There is no list.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.988
How do you keep track of everyone?

32:28.071 --> 32:30.365
-We look at your permit.
-Well, I have a permit.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.951
I showed it to your friend yesterday,
and I can prove it.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.578
He stood here and gave a speech

32:34.661 --> 32:36.955
about how we were gonna die
because of the weather.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.416
He said, "You all have permits,
so you can go, but you shouldn't."

32:40.501 --> 32:43.754
-Good speech.
-If I saw the speech, he saw my permit,

32:43.837 --> 32:47.674
because he said, "You all have permits,"
and I was part of "you all."

32:47.758 --> 32:49.551
-I'm the "all" in "you all."
-Great.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.720
-So I can go?
-As soon as I see your permit.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.055
I have my permit,
but it's not in my coat or my jeans.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.559
If it's not in my coat or jeans,
there's a chance it's packed in there.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.561
If it's in there,
it is really packed in there.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.438
If I open this up, it's like
<i>The Hurt Locker.</i> No one survives.

33:02.523 --> 33:05.025
I can't let you through without a permit.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.610
Come on.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.533
Oh, my God.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.035
If I open this up,
I'll never get it re-packed.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.663
-What were you gonna do on the trail?
-Die. Right?

33:17.746 --> 33:19.665
-I don't know what to tell you.
-"Go ahead"?

33:20.248 --> 33:23.376
Look, what's your name?

33:23.459 --> 33:25.962
-Park Ranger.
-All right, Park.

33:26.046 --> 33:29.007
I came all the way here
from this tiny town in Connecticut

33:29.090 --> 33:31.552
just to walk out there
and look at the wilderness,

33:31.635 --> 33:34.971
and stare at the beautiful trees,
and bathe in the crystal clear lakes,

33:35.055 --> 33:37.390
and think super deep thoughts.

33:37.473 --> 33:40.644
And I know that a handsome,
strapping man like you

33:40.727 --> 33:44.898
understands the deep, throbbing,
primal need

33:44.981 --> 33:46.942
to connect with woodchucks and...

33:47.025 --> 33:50.403
just imagine, underneath all this,
I am really hot.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.073
Ma'am, I'm a park ranger.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.784
-I don't know what that means.
-No permit, no hiking.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.661
-Can I bribe you?
-Sure.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.413
-My wallet's in the pack.
-I will see you tomorrow.

34:00.496 --> 34:04.084
All right, well, see you tomorrow.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.048
I got it.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.758
That's...
You... you can have that.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.162
Aw, come on.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.548
I hate nature.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.017
- Hello?
<i>- I was 13 years old.</i>

36:28.311 --> 36:29.479
Lorelai?

36:30.063 --> 36:31.523
It was my birthday.

36:32.023 --> 36:36.361
And Royston Sinclair III
had broken my heart in front of everyone.

36:37.653 --> 36:41.366
I'd snuck into your closet that morning
and took that green beaded top

36:41.449 --> 36:43.409
<i>that was your mother's,</i>

36:43.493 --> 36:47.288
that you kept so carefully wrapped up
in tissue paper in your cedar closet.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.832
I was never supposed to touch it.

36:48.915 --> 36:53.211
But I stole it, and I wore it to school
with my Chemin de Fer sailor jeans,

36:53.294 --> 36:55.881
and I thought no one
was as stylish as I was.

36:56.798 --> 36:59.760
But Royston laughed.
He said I was cheap.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.013
He said the only reason
he'd been my boyfriend

37:03.096 --> 37:06.099
was because he was mad at Angie Morgan
and he wasn't anymore.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.310
He called me loud and weird.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.939
He said there was a rumor going around
that I wasn't actually a Gilmore.

37:13.023 --> 37:15.901
<i>That I was</i>
<i>the gardener's daughter and...</i>

37:15.984 --> 37:18.695
<i>you'd bought me because you couldn't</i>
<i>have children of your own.</i>

37:19.195 --> 37:20.864
And I was crushed.

37:21.697 --> 37:25.660
And I ran out of class...
and I ran out of school,

37:25.744 --> 37:27.245
and I went to the mall.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.248
And I was sitting in the food court,

37:30.331 --> 37:34.753
wishing I had some money to buy a pretzel
'cause I was starving,

37:35.711 --> 37:38.924
and I looked up... and there was Dad.

37:41.843 --> 37:44.637
Standing in front of me... at the mall.

37:45.555 --> 37:49.810
He never came to the mall.
That day, he went to the mall.

37:51.144 --> 37:54.898
And he was furious.
"Why aren't you in school?" he asked.

37:54.981 --> 37:59.319
"Tell me right now, Lorelai.
Why aren't you in school?"

38:00.695 --> 38:02.739
And I tried to think of something,

38:03.198 --> 38:07.327
some lie that would make sense,
but I couldn't.

38:08.244 --> 38:11.832
All I could think
was that yesterday...

38:11.915 --> 38:16.002
I had a boyfriend who loved me
and today I didn't.

38:16.086 --> 38:22.467
And I started to cry.
I just sat there like an idiot, bawling.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.804
And finally...

38:25.887 --> 38:28.181
after what seemed like forever,

38:28.264 --> 38:31.976
I managed to control myself a little bit,
and I calmed down.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.271
And I waited.

38:35.355 --> 38:39.734
I waited for him to yell at me,
to punish me, to ground me forever,

38:39.818 --> 38:42.821
to tell me how disappointed he was in me.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.155
And nothing came.

38:45.073 --> 38:48.326
And finally, I got up enough courage...

38:50.078 --> 38:53.957
to look up at him,
and he was standing there...

38:55.250 --> 38:56.960
with a pretzel.

38:58.753 --> 39:02.090
A giant pretzel covered with mustard.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.931
And he handed it to me
and he said, "Let's go."

39:11.432 --> 39:13.684
And he took me to the movies.

39:13.768 --> 39:17.480
We saw <i>Grease</i> and <i>An Unmarried Woman.</i>

39:17.563 --> 39:19.815
Something for me
and something for him, he said.

39:20.358 --> 39:23.611
<i>He bought me popcorn and Red Hots,</i>

39:23.694 --> 39:25.906
<i>and we sat in the dark and we watched.</i>

39:27.115 --> 39:28.867
And then he took me home,

39:28.950 --> 39:31.786
and he gave me his sweater
to cover up the stolen top,

39:32.453 --> 39:35.040
and he told you
that he'd picked me up from school

39:35.123 --> 39:37.333
and taken me to the club for a soda.

39:38.418 --> 39:42.255
And that was it.
We never discussed it again.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.676
It was the best birthday I ever had.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.809
I just thought you should know.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.395
Thank you, Lorelai.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.565
Bye, Mom.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.210
It's no use
you sitting there looking at me.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.504
You're not getting this
until it cools down.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.631
It's stupid enough
that I buy your own steak.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.009
It's even stupider that I cook it for you.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.970
I'm not gonna blow on it.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.555
That only works with Lorelai,
so don't even...

40:39.228 --> 40:41.898
You tell anyone about this,
and we are getting a cat.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.943
Lorelai.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.280
-What are you doing home?
-Don't come near me.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.531
Why?

40:50.615 --> 40:54.244
Because... I smell.
Every part of me smells.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.829
I... I didn't even hike and I smell.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.457
I showered and I took the plane back home.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.917
I haven't been near a cactus
in the last 24 hours.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.879
And all you have to do
is think about hiking and you smell.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.756
-You didn't hike?
-They wouldn't let me.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.424
-Why not?
-Because I forgot things,

41:08.508 --> 41:10.801
I taped dried stew to my pack...

41:10.885 --> 41:14.930
Anyway, I didn't hike.
But, see, I didn't actually go to hike.

41:15.015 --> 41:18.351
I mean, I went to hike,
but I only wanted to figure something out.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.645
I figured it out without hiking,
which was great,

41:20.728 --> 41:23.939
'cause the thru-hiker looked like
Christian Bale in <i>The Machinist.</i>

41:24.024 --> 41:25.900
She knew
how to get all that crap in her pack.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.735
-Lorelai, I--
-I was getting coffee...

41:27.818 --> 41:31.864
I should've known
it would have something to do with coffee.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.242
Everything in my life has something
to do with coffee.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.745
I believe, in a former life, I was coffee.
But the place was closed.

41:37.828 --> 41:42.000
And I had to wait, and I walked
around the back and there was this hill.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.834
And... I don't know why,

41:43.918 --> 41:47.463
but I walked up the hill
and there was this vista,

41:47.547 --> 41:51.134
and suddenly something
became completely clear to me.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.137
- Luke--
- Stop!

41:55.013 --> 41:56.889
-I know what you're doing.
-You do?

41:56.972 --> 42:00.935
You're getting ready to leave me,
and I have to tell you it's a big mistake.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.396
-Wait, Luke--
-I've seen the signs for months.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.273
-What signs?
-Your bolting signs.

42:05.356 --> 42:09.402
You know, the distance, the therapy,
then suddenly you're gonna do <i>Wild?</i>

42:09.485 --> 42:12.530
Really? You're gonna go hiking alone,
with nothing else involved?

42:12.613 --> 42:15.825
No music festival or Hello Kitty booth.
Just you and nature.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.118
I admit it sounded weird.

42:17.202 --> 42:21.081
I don't care what anybody says.
Needing space is never a good thing. Ever.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.040
I needed space before.

42:22.123 --> 42:24.459
I needed space with Nicole
and we got divorced.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.586
I mean, that's what "needing space" means.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.839
-It means, "I need space and an attorney."
-Luke, just--

42:29.922 --> 42:33.008
We have been through too much here,
you and me, okay?

42:33.093 --> 42:35.886
Things aren't perfect
and there's been some issues.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.931
You've kept things from me
and I've kept things from you.

42:39.014 --> 42:40.850
You wanted me to sleep
with all those women--

42:40.933 --> 42:43.102
We've got to clarify
how this surrogate thing works.

42:43.186 --> 42:46.647
I am not unhappy, okay?
I am not unsatisfied.

42:46.731 --> 42:51.152
You think I'm unhappy and unsatisfied,
and I can't convince you that I am not!

42:51.236 --> 42:52.570
I mean...

42:52.653 --> 42:55.781
this right here is all I will ever need.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.909
I never thought that it would happen.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.828
That you and me... that we would happen.
But we did.

43:00.911 --> 43:04.832
Listen, I know I am not the easiest guy
in the world to build a life with

43:04.915 --> 43:06.292
and to share a house with,

43:06.376 --> 43:09.754
but there is no one who will be
more here for you than me.

43:09.837 --> 43:12.673
I will never leave.
I will never think about leaving.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.176
I will do whatever it takes
to fix what's wrong.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.677
I'll go to your nutty therapist.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.347
I'll open up a franchise
if that's who you want me to be,

43:19.430 --> 43:21.808
I'll run the kitchen at your inn.

43:21.891 --> 43:23.392
I'll give you back the entire closet.

43:23.476 --> 43:26.187
I only took that half
because you insisted I do it.

43:26.271 --> 43:29.190
I just figured
you would take it back eventually, anyhow.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.067
I started. I didn't know if you noticed.

43:31.151 --> 43:32.943
-It started to look pink.
-There were sparkles.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.529
-It's yours. Take it.
-I don't want it.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.780
-Take it.
-I don't need it.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.031
Yes, you do!

43:37.115 --> 43:39.825
You need it.
You need the space, and I need you.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.327
God damn it, Lorelai!

43:41.411 --> 43:43.913
We have been through so much.
I mean, we have...

43:43.996 --> 43:46.249
We've watched each other
go from person to person.

43:46.332 --> 43:49.710
I mean, there was Rachel, and Max
and Christopher!

43:49.794 --> 43:51.879
I had to watch you marry that guy!
It was awful.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.882
But we... we made it here.
We made it through all of that.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.634
I mean, you can't leave.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.928
-You just... you just can't leave--
-Luke!

44:02.473 --> 44:04.016
I think we should get married.

44:05.685 --> 44:06.686
What?

44:07.562 --> 44:08.813
We've waited way too long.

44:09.564 --> 44:10.940
But I... I thought--

44:11.023 --> 44:12.983
I already picked a date.
It's this month.

44:13.067 --> 44:16.321
It's on a Sunday
because you close early Sunday, anyhow.

44:16.404 --> 44:17.655
Doesn't matter really.

44:19.114 --> 44:20.283
It's all set.

44:21.492 --> 44:22.702
It's set?

44:23.911 --> 44:25.788
It's all set.

44:34.129 --> 44:36.507
Exactly the reaction I was looking for.

44:39.719 --> 44:43.764
I should probably get a...
a better one or a newer one.

44:45.308 --> 44:46.392
Don't you dare.

44:51.231 --> 44:54.400
Just gotta tell ya
before this thing goes on,

44:54.484 --> 44:57.237
you got to realize the only way out
is in a body bag.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.197
Now we don't have to write our vows.

45:29.310 --> 45:33.356
-Two limes as requested.
-Thank you, Jack.

45:35.525 --> 45:38.319
Em, listen,
I've got some bad news.

45:38.403 --> 45:39.945
Lobster's fine.

45:40.029 --> 45:42.239
-What?
-What?

45:42.323 --> 45:45.117
-I was talking about my news.
-What news?

45:45.535 --> 45:47.036
I have to go back to the city.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.579
-Today?
-Yes.

45:48.663 --> 45:52.207
Oh. Well, that is too bad.
Berta!

45:52.292 --> 45:55.127
I feel terrible. I was gonna
take you to the Whaling Museum.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.296
Well, next time.

45:56.379 --> 45:58.964
Mr. Smith is heading back to Hartford.
Get his...

45:59.048 --> 46:01.091
Mr. Smith is... His bag.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.677
-Ah, ah, ah.
-He's going bye-bye.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.887
You should find people
you can understand.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.597
I'm working on it.

46:06.681 --> 46:08.516
-Well, drive safely.
-Uh-huh.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.059
Ah, thank you, Berta.

46:10.142 --> 46:12.353
-Oh, yes. <i>Gracias,</i> Berta.
-Bye-bye.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.897
I'll call you later to check in,
all right?

46:14.980 --> 46:18.067
I wish my first three wives
had been as understanding as you.

46:18.150 --> 46:21.111
- Yes, that would've been helpful.
- I'll miss you.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.698
Of course you will.

47:09.577 --> 47:11.245
The manufacturing of candles

47:11.328 --> 47:16.083
from the head matter of sperm whales
began in America around 1748.

47:16.166 --> 47:21.046
Nantucketer Christopher Hussey killed
the island's first sperm whale in 1712.

47:21.130 --> 47:25.593
From then on, sperm whales became
the specialty of Nantucket whalers.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.262
Whales were very important
to Nantucketers.

47:28.345 --> 47:31.807
In addition to oil for lamps,
whales were used for food,

47:31.891 --> 47:36.479
the bones were used to make skirt hoops,
umbrellas, furniture springs...

47:36.562 --> 47:38.939
- Is that a whale?
- That is a whale.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.065
It's big.

47:40.149 --> 47:42.067
- It is big. Very big.
- Is he dead?

47:42.151 --> 47:44.945
I don't know. Now where was I?

47:45.029 --> 47:46.864
Umbrellas, furniture springs...

47:46.947 --> 47:49.575
Oh, right.
Umbrellas, furniture springs,

47:49.659 --> 47:54.455
buggy whips, toys, collar stays,
springs in early typewriters,

47:54.538 --> 47:58.000
curtain pulls, dog collars,
back scratchers,

47:58.084 --> 48:02.546
bicycle spokes, hairpins,
toothpicks, flag poles...

48:02.630 --> 48:05.007
<i>Rory, it's your grandmother.</i>

48:05.090 --> 48:09.094
<i>I am so sorry to have missed your call.</i>
<i>Yes, I am in Nantucket,</i>

48:09.178 --> 48:12.682
<i>and yes, the house is empty,</i>
<i>and yes, it is all yours.</i>

48:12.765 --> 48:14.349
<i>Berta and the family are with me,</i>

48:14.434 --> 48:17.061
<i>but there are fresh sheets</i>
<i>on the bed in the guest room,</i>

48:17.144 --> 48:19.271
<i>and there's some wonderful dishes</i>
<i>in the freezer.</i>

48:19.354 --> 48:21.857
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what they are or what's in them,</i>

48:21.941 --> 48:26.070
<i>but Berta made them and they are divine.</i>
<i>Call if you need anything.</i>

48:50.845 --> 48:52.888
<i>...we have with Lorelai and Rory?</i>

48:52.972 --> 48:55.099
<i>She knows what time we dine.</i>
<i>Why are you eating so...</i>

48:55.182 --> 48:57.059
-quickly?
-We're not eating quickly.

48:57.143 --> 48:59.812
You've been on the phone.
It just seems like we've eaten a lot.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.315
- <i>Who could that be?</i>
<i>- Emily.</i>

49:03.399 --> 49:04.984
<i>Aren't we popular?</i>

49:05.067 --> 49:06.652
<i>Richard, perhaps you could get that</i>

49:06.736 --> 49:10.865
<i>while I have another bath sheet versus</i>
<i>bath towel debate with your mother.</i>

49:18.080 --> 49:20.541
- <i>I'm gonna make it.</i>
<i>- Rory, you're not serious.</i>

49:20.624 --> 49:22.751
- <i>That hardly looks like dinner.</i>
<i>- I agree.</i>

49:22.835 --> 49:25.921
<i>Rory, that's food you eat</i>
<i>at the carnival or in a Turkish prison.</i>

49:26.005 --> 49:27.381
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>

49:27.465 --> 49:29.758
- <i>But--</i>
<i>- Listen, just leave it up to me.</i>

49:29.842 --> 49:32.761
<i>You guys go back into the living room,</i>
<i>and I'll call you when it's ready.</i>

50:37.660 --> 50:40.287
Well, Damon,
it's a very impressive résumé.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.497
And here are my references,
in case you need them.

50:42.582 --> 50:44.625
Oh, we will. Believe me.

50:45.710 --> 50:48.921
Oh, come on.
Ian Schrager as a reference?

50:49.004 --> 50:51.298
- He recruited me out of college.
- Interesting.

50:51.381 --> 50:54.594
I'm just wondering why you didn't stay
in the Ian Schrager world.

50:54.677 --> 50:56.178
Why are you looking at a small place?

50:56.261 --> 50:59.431
Yes, any skeletons
in that closet of yours?

50:59.514 --> 51:01.934
Drug problems?
Cheating scandals?

51:02.017 --> 51:04.604
Played Rolfe in <i>The Sound of Music</i>
one too many times?

51:04.687 --> 51:07.606
I just wanted to experience
some other management styles.

51:07.690 --> 51:09.316
That's very commendable.

51:09.399 --> 51:12.319
Yes.
Big gold star for you.

51:12.402 --> 51:16.866
Um, well, we are meeting other candidates,
but you're definitely in the running.

51:16.949 --> 51:20.703
-Thank you so much for coming in, Damon.
-It was nice to meet you.

51:26.876 --> 51:30.379
-I know. I was rude.
-And off-key. I don't care.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.840
I don't like
that someone else will be working here.

51:32.923 --> 51:33.757
Neither do I.

51:33.841 --> 51:37.011
Mini Ian Schrager will put velvet ropes up
all over the place

51:37.094 --> 51:38.888
for Chloë Sevigny to trip over.

51:39.471 --> 51:41.390
Next up, Molly Daniel.

51:41.473 --> 51:44.685
Ugh, her last name's a first name.
I hate that.

51:45.602 --> 51:47.855
-Was I ever that young?
-No.

51:47.938 --> 51:49.106
Oh.

51:49.189 --> 51:51.108
-Plumber.
-Oh, go. I'll do this.

51:51.191 --> 51:54.069
Tell him we aren't paying
for the new faucets. They are vile!

51:54.153 --> 51:56.488
Mkay. Hey, Ed.
Can you hold on a second?

51:56.571 --> 51:59.366
Uh, Molly,
Michel will start your interview.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.201
Okay. Hi there.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.538
-You brought some Kleenex?
-Uh, yes?

52:04.621 --> 52:06.206
Hmm. I'd get 'em out now.

52:07.166 --> 52:09.794
Now, your name is, uh, Molly.

52:10.920 --> 52:11.921
Why?

52:22.848 --> 52:23.849
Huh.

52:40.657 --> 52:41.826
Hello?

52:50.584 --> 52:52.753
- I raise you five.
- Call.

52:52.837 --> 52:55.297
- Three deuces.
- Oh, sugarfoot!

52:55.380 --> 52:59.384
Excuse me, ladies, nuns, sisters.
Is Whoopi Goldberg around anywhere?

52:59.468 --> 53:01.553
If I had a nickel for every time
I heard that...

53:01.636 --> 53:03.347
Sorry. I noticed you're moving.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.057
Mr. Porter died Thursday night.

53:05.140 --> 53:07.684
He was the last one to go,
God rest his soul.

53:07.768 --> 53:09.895
-What's going on with the building?
-It's for sale.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.105
Really? For sale?

53:11.188 --> 53:12.940
Why do you ask?
Are you looking to buy?

53:13.023 --> 53:16.235
I could be.
It's sure got a lot of potential.

53:16.318 --> 53:18.362
And a family of badgers
living in the attic.

53:18.445 --> 53:19.571
Sister Beatrice,

53:19.654 --> 53:23.283
the real estate lady said not to say
things like that to potential buyers.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.911
I didn't mention
the triple homicide this time, did I?

53:27.121 --> 53:29.081
I'm sorry. The place is old,

53:29.164 --> 53:31.875
-but has wonderful bones and a new roof.
-Really?

53:31.959 --> 53:33.669
If you're interested,
move fast.

53:33.753 --> 53:36.130
Katy Perry was
sniffing around here earlier.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.758
She dresses like a hooker,
but she comes with cash.

53:38.841 --> 53:42.887
Well, I bet you'd rather have
the ownership stay in Stars Hollow, right?

53:42.970 --> 53:44.972
To be honest,
if the price was right,

53:45.055 --> 53:47.892
-I'd sell the place to Beelzebub himself.
-Wow.

53:47.975 --> 53:50.269
We've got a beautiful new building
in Pebble Beach.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.563
The rest of the nuns are already there.
The pope drove by once.

53:53.647 --> 53:57.442
-Okay. Well, I'll think quick.
-Here. Take a one-sheet.

53:57.526 --> 53:59.862
-Hey, do you play poker?
-No. Not really.

53:59.945 --> 54:01.113
Hmm. Katy plays poker.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.783
Well, thank you.

54:13.500 --> 54:16.170
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing?

55:17.982 --> 55:19.274
-Coffee?
-Ice cream?

55:19.358 --> 55:20.484
Mmm-hmm.

55:24.738 --> 55:26.823
-So you got my e-mail?
-I did.

55:26.907 --> 55:29.409
-Mmm-hmm.
-Thank you. I texted you.

55:29.493 --> 55:32.121
I got it. And your note.
Thank you.

55:34.623 --> 55:38.460
- So, you guys are finally gonna do it.
- Finally.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.796
Opening day of the Harvest Festival.

55:41.380 --> 55:43.132
-Because there's a hot dog cart?
-Exactly.

55:43.215 --> 55:46.510
And will it be free hot dogs
or will everyone have to buy their own?

55:46.593 --> 55:50.722
I'm sorry. I'm Emily Gilmore's daughter.
Open hot dog cart all night.

55:50.805 --> 55:52.016
So it's a classy wedding.

55:52.099 --> 55:55.019
- It's going to be perfect.
- Yes. It is.

55:55.102 --> 55:57.396
-And it's finally going to happen!
-Yes. It is!

55:58.939 --> 56:00.607
So...

56:00.690 --> 56:03.693
My e-mail was lengthy
and chock full of information.

56:03.777 --> 56:05.529
And all your text said was, "Got it."

56:05.612 --> 56:07.114
-It said more than that.
-Hardly.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.283
I need more. Details.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.451
What's been going on?

56:11.535 --> 56:12.619
Well...

56:17.624 --> 56:18.708
Term paper?

56:19.668 --> 56:21.045
Look at it.

56:28.677 --> 56:30.220
It's the first three chapters.

56:32.514 --> 56:36.810
It feels light.
You must've left my mother out.

56:36.893 --> 56:40.940
I sat down and it just came out.
Flew out.

56:41.023 --> 56:43.858
It's like this story has been
sitting in my brain for years,

56:43.943 --> 56:46.195
-taking up space.
-Like the lyrics to "My Sharona."

56:46.278 --> 56:47.446
Exactly.

56:47.529 --> 56:50.449
It's been there,
waiting for me to put it down on paper.

56:50.532 --> 56:53.118
-Nothing I've written has been this easy.
-Mmm-hmm.

56:53.202 --> 56:56.455
And I get your feelings. I really do.
So, here's the deal.

56:56.538 --> 56:59.082
I want you to read it. Just read it.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.751
After you do,
if you still think it's a bad idea,

57:01.835 --> 57:05.130
if you think it's invasive,
then I won't finish it. I promise.

57:05.214 --> 57:09.051
I will just throw those pages away.
And that's it. No harm, no foul.

57:09.134 --> 57:12.137
- Deal?
- Rory...

57:12.220 --> 57:14.014
I promise. No harm, no foul.

57:14.098 --> 57:16.475
-But you won't like me anymore.
-Not true.

57:16.558 --> 57:19.353
-I'll be your Candy Spelling.
-You won't be my Candy Spelling.

57:22.481 --> 57:23.482
Okay.

57:24.399 --> 57:25.567
Thank you.

57:27.819 --> 57:32.616
So... now, shall we discuss
bridesmaid dresses?

57:32.699 --> 57:35.911
Uh, yes.
I'll let you pick.

57:36.703 --> 57:38.997
<i>Priscilla Queen of the Desert</i> or <i>desnudas</i>.

57:39.081 --> 57:41.458
Yep, I'm going to need
some donuts for this.

57:50.717 --> 57:53.178
So, Serena...
Am I saying that right?

57:53.262 --> 57:54.429
Yes.

57:54.513 --> 57:57.807
-It's not Serenna? Like "henna"?
-No. Serena.

57:57.891 --> 58:00.018
That's that tennis player's name?
Serena?

58:00.102 --> 58:02.729
Actually, my momma
named me after <i>Bewitched.</i>

58:02.812 --> 58:04.231
Well, that's a fun story.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.732
So, Serena,

58:05.815 --> 58:09.236
first off, congratulations are in order
on your brand new marriage.

58:09.319 --> 58:12.322
Renford seems like a new man
since you two tied the knot.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.741
Thank you.
I think it's the juicing.

58:14.824 --> 58:18.078
And now you want to become
a member of the DAR.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.705
I do. I love history.

58:19.788 --> 58:21.665
It was one
of my favorite subjects in school.

58:21.748 --> 58:24.126
- Where did you go to school?
- UC Santa Cruz.

58:24.209 --> 58:26.461
- It's in California.
- How sunny!

58:26.545 --> 58:29.423
But I didn't finish.
I got into fitness really young.

58:29.506 --> 58:32.217
I worked at Crunch
and SoulCycle for a while...

58:32.301 --> 58:34.011
and Tracy Anderson's in Brentwood.

58:34.094 --> 58:36.430
And then I moved east
and was a floater at Equinox.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.473
That's where I met Renford.

58:38.557 --> 58:40.559
Well, my goodness. What a tale!

58:40.642 --> 58:42.394
You could have a one-woman show.

58:45.605 --> 58:48.275
And you know about
our little organization?

58:48.358 --> 58:51.320
Oh, yes.
I've been to your parties.

58:51.403 --> 58:54.698
Well, you have some very nice references.

58:54.781 --> 58:56.491
Rennie's friends
have been welcoming.

58:56.575 --> 59:00.328
You have time to devote to the club?
With all your exercising and everything?

59:00.412 --> 59:02.789
Oh, yes.
It would be a top priority.

59:02.872 --> 59:05.542
-All meetings are mandatory, you know?
-Oh, yes, I know.

59:07.211 --> 59:11.506
And proper attire is very important, too.
You have gloves?

59:11.590 --> 59:14.801
- I don't. But I'm a good shopper.
- I have no doubt.

59:16.886 --> 59:17.929
Crumbs, dear.

59:18.012 --> 59:20.515
Well, everything looks to be in order.

59:20.599 --> 59:23.227
Give us a few days to deliberate.
We will get back to you.

59:23.310 --> 59:24.353
But I have to say,

59:24.436 --> 59:27.814
you're a delightful young woman,
and we have so enjoyed meeting you.

59:27.897 --> 59:30.109
- Bullshit!
- Emily!

59:30.192 --> 59:31.568
You're not getting in, honey.

59:31.651 --> 59:33.903
-That's not your decision--
-You were never getting in.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.239
This was a courtesy meeting,

59:35.322 --> 59:37.699
because Renford is a very big deal
in our circle

59:37.782 --> 59:39.159
and he's got more money than God,

59:39.242 --> 59:41.453
despite the fact that he's paying off
three other wives.

59:41.536 --> 59:43.455
Emily, you don't know what you're saying.

59:43.538 --> 59:45.874
Oh, come on. It's always the same.

59:45.957 --> 59:48.085
The trophy wife... That's you, honey...

59:48.168 --> 59:50.420
She comes in here
with her big hair and her big tits,

59:50.504 --> 59:52.714
and she sits there, and we all smile

59:52.797 --> 59:56.260
and say subtly snide things
about her name and her family,

59:56.343 --> 59:58.845
-which she usually doesn't get. Right?
-I--

59:58.929 --> 59:59.971
And then we say,

1:00:00.054 --> 1:00:04.226
"It was lovely meeting you,"
and we send her off and we laugh,

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:07.896
and we have tea, and we buy
a rocking chair that may or may not

1:00:07.979 --> 1:00:12.025
have been Benjamin Franklin's
barber's cousin's proctologist's,

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.653
and we pat ourselves
on the back for a job well done,

1:00:14.736 --> 1:00:16.738
and we go home
and we forget all about her.

1:00:16.821 --> 1:00:19.283
It's all just a big pile of bullshit.

1:00:19.366 --> 1:00:21.785
Emily, this language.
Where is it coming from?

1:00:22.952 --> 1:00:24.788
Serena, you are wife number four.

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:28.542
Sometimes, if a man is very old,
that's a good position to be in,

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:31.961
because he'll be too exhausted
to try and find wife number five.

1:00:32.045 --> 1:00:33.422
And maybe you can wait him out.

1:00:33.505 --> 1:00:36.550
Like Barbara Sinatra.
She just waited him out.

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:38.927
But Renford is in perfect health,

1:00:39.010 --> 1:00:41.638
and the minute he finds a new place
with bottle service,

1:00:41.721 --> 1:00:45.934
you'll be right back at Tracy Anderson's,
which you should've thought about

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:48.853
before you signed that ridiculous
prenup he gave you.

1:00:49.437 --> 1:00:53.400
Oh yes, we know all about that prenup.
We all saw the prenup.

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:56.736
We had tea, and we passed it around,
and we laughed at it,

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:59.906
and then we bought
a very expensive precolonial douche,

1:00:59.989 --> 1:01:02.075
and patted ourselves
on the back for a job well done,

1:01:02.159 --> 1:01:05.287
and then we threw out
the last trophy wife's application.

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:07.038
Pammy, I think her name was.

1:01:07.121 --> 1:01:10.334
Serena, would you mind waiting outside
for just a moment, please?

1:01:13.002 --> 1:01:14.713
That dress didn't help!

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:21.345
What the hell is going on?

1:01:21.428 --> 1:01:23.472
-I can't do it anymore.
-Can't do what?

1:01:23.555 --> 1:01:27.559
I can't spend any more time
and energy on artifice and bullshit.

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:29.894
Why do you love that word so much?

1:01:29.978 --> 1:01:33.190
-She's not getting in, is she?
-Well, of course she's not!

1:01:33.273 --> 1:01:35.442
But this is not the way
she doesn't get in.

1:01:35.525 --> 1:01:37.861
There's a system, Emily.
And you know that.

1:01:37.944 --> 1:01:41.281
We meet, we say we'll discuss it,
we don't, and they don't get in!

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:44.409
-And that is the way she doesn't get in.
-Well, that's just--

1:01:44.493 --> 1:01:46.578
Don't you say "bullshit"
to me one more time!

1:01:46.661 --> 1:01:48.288
- Fine.
- You know, Emily,

1:01:48.372 --> 1:01:52.166
you've been a member for many years,
and you've done some wonderful work.

1:01:52.251 --> 1:01:55.086
We know you're having a hard time
dealing with Richard's passing.

1:01:55.169 --> 1:01:58.340
Maybe you should take some time.
Rest, regroup,

1:01:58.423 --> 1:02:01.551
and come back when you're ready
and happy to participate again.

1:02:01.635 --> 1:02:03.428
We will be here waiting for you.

1:02:03.512 --> 1:02:06.806
-So, basically, you're telling me I'm out.
-Basically, yes.

1:02:06.890 --> 1:02:09.851
But we don't say it. You're just out.
That's how it works!

1:02:10.936 --> 1:02:15.023
This whole thing is dead to me, anyhow.
It died with Richard.

1:02:20.987 --> 1:02:24.366
- Finalize the guest list!
- I need to get back to the diner!

1:02:24.449 --> 1:02:27.411
The diner is fine.
I called. It doesn't miss you.

1:02:27.494 --> 1:02:30.914
-It's in its underwear blasting Bob Seger.
-I don't care who comes. I told you that.

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:33.124
-At least look at the list.
-I looked at the list.

1:02:33.207 --> 1:02:36.586
Now, on my side, I have everybody.

1:02:36.670 --> 1:02:40.048
The town, Rory's friends,
my mother, my mother's friends.

1:02:40.131 --> 1:02:41.258
On your side, I have Caesar.

1:02:41.341 --> 1:02:43.092
-Caesar can't come. He has to work.
-Why not?

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:44.719
You're not giving him the day off?

1:02:44.803 --> 1:02:45.929
-No.
-Why not?

1:02:46.012 --> 1:02:47.722
-If I do, I can't go.
-Close Luke's.

1:02:47.806 --> 1:02:51.393
I don't need to close Luke's.
I have employees who can keep Luke's open.

1:02:51.476 --> 1:02:53.937
Without Caesar,
all I have for you is Liz and T.J.,

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:56.356
-cousin Billy and Uncle Brago.
-What cousin Billy?

1:02:56.439 --> 1:02:58.066
-Your cousin.
-I don't have a cousin Billy.

1:02:58.149 --> 1:02:59.567
-He's coming.
-He can't come.

1:02:59.651 --> 1:03:01.236
-Why not?
-I don't have a cousin Billy.

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:04.698
-He already booked his flight.
-But I don't have a... Fine.

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:06.575
-Put him at Caesar's table.
-Thank you.

1:03:06.658 --> 1:03:09.619
Lorelai, I need to finish
pinning that dress.

1:03:09.703 --> 1:03:10.954
I don't want you to lean over

1:03:11.037 --> 1:03:14.291
and have your Deanna Durbins
tumble out in front of the clergy.

1:03:14.374 --> 1:03:16.543
-Just one minute, Miss Celine.
-Lucas!

1:03:16.626 --> 1:03:17.877
You are next.

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:21.298
We need to make sure that suit hugs
only the things that need hugging.

1:03:21.881 --> 1:03:24.884
Kirk Douglas taught me that.
That and the hora.

1:03:24.968 --> 1:03:26.886
My suit's fine, Miss Celine.

1:03:26.970 --> 1:03:31.015
You know, from here,
you look a little like Mr. Eli Wallach.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:33.768
I met him on the set of <i>Baby Doll.</i>

1:03:33.852 --> 1:03:35.937
He was all about the method.

1:03:36.020 --> 1:03:37.981
He would say, "Don't you look at me.

1:03:38.064 --> 1:03:41.234
I've got to save my erotic energy
for Carroll.

1:03:41.318 --> 1:03:45.572
Yeah, if that's what Kazan wants,
that's what Kazan will get."

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:49.283
I was very desirable back then.
Ask Kazan.

1:03:49.368 --> 1:03:50.619
How old is this woman?

1:03:50.702 --> 1:03:52.579
You've chosen well, Lorelai.

1:03:52.662 --> 1:03:54.831
He'll look wonderful
on the Christmas card.

1:03:54.914 --> 1:03:57.125
-Thank you, Miss Celine.
-All right, hurry up!

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:59.461
-You're next, Eli.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:03:59.544 --> 1:04:00.920
-What about friends?
-What friends?

1:04:01.004 --> 1:04:03.548
-You must have friends.
-Everyone I know, you know.

1:04:03.631 --> 1:04:05.717
It is your big day.
The biggest day of your life.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:08.136
You have peaked.
There is nowhere to go from here but down.

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:10.680
Knowing that nothing lies ahead
but corns and death,

1:04:10.764 --> 1:04:13.642
is there anyone else
you would like to come to your wedding?

1:04:14.225 --> 1:04:16.978
Well, I guess there's one guy
I could invite. An old buddy.

1:04:17.062 --> 1:04:19.064
One guy! Old buddy! Great.

1:04:19.147 --> 1:04:22.359
There's a spot at table six.
He can bring a date or go home with Patty.

1:04:22.442 --> 1:04:24.944
-What's the name?
-Last name's Sutherland.

1:04:25.028 --> 1:04:27.614
-First name Kiefer.
-Really? That's the name?

1:04:27.697 --> 1:04:28.990
-Yup.
-Is it spelled the same?

1:04:29.073 --> 1:04:31.117
-As what?
-As the real Kiefer Sutherland?

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:34.663
-It is the real Kiefer Sutherland.
-No, the real Kiefer Sutherland.

1:04:34.746 --> 1:04:36.331
"Chloe, the canisters are armed!
Damn it!"

1:04:36.415 --> 1:04:37.331
Yeah, that guy.

1:04:37.416 --> 1:04:40.460
"The Russians put a bomb on a truck
headed for Brooklyn Heights! Damn it!"

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:41.670
Yes. Kiefer Sutherland.

1:04:41.753 --> 1:04:43.087
"I've been injected with anthrax.

1:04:43.171 --> 1:04:46.758
-The antidote is in my other pants!"
-We did a baseball camp years ago.

1:04:46.841 --> 1:04:48.885
We both stunk. We bonded.
We still go fishing.

1:04:48.968 --> 1:04:51.805
-It never occurred to you to mention this?
-Like, when?

1:04:53.097 --> 1:04:55.975
Okay, Mom's moving to Patty's table
'cause there's no way

1:04:56.059 --> 1:04:57.977
I'm not sitting next to Kiefer Sutherland.

1:04:58.478 --> 1:05:01.565
That's fine.
Okay, three o'clock.

1:05:02.649 --> 1:05:03.733
Bye.

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:18.707
-I'll be back in a while.
-He knows Kiefer Sutherland!

1:05:18.790 --> 1:05:20.374
-The real one?
-There's only one.

1:05:20.459 --> 1:05:22.836
"I'm Agent Jack Bauer.
This is the longest day of my life.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:25.046
My wife and mistress
have the same face and haircut."

1:05:25.129 --> 1:05:26.590
-That one?
-Yes. "Damn it!"

1:05:26.673 --> 1:05:28.717
-Bump someone off our table.
-Way ahead of you.

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:30.635
Hey, can you get some ice cream?

1:05:30.719 --> 1:05:32.554
-We're out.
-Got it.

1:05:32.637 --> 1:05:34.055
- Yo!
- What?

1:05:34.138 --> 1:05:35.389
-Purse.
-Right.

1:05:35.474 --> 1:05:37.266
-You okay?
-Yeah. Just a busy, busy time.

1:05:37.350 --> 1:05:38.935
-Rocky road.
-Copy that.

1:05:39.853 --> 1:05:41.646
-What are you doing?
-Gotta fit in the dress.

1:05:41.730 --> 1:05:43.773
-Wedding's in three days.
-So you see the need.

1:05:43.857 --> 1:05:46.985
- You could just forgo the ice cream.
- Get out.

1:05:47.068 --> 1:05:48.820
Out. Bye.

1:05:54.826 --> 1:05:57.454
Oh, you're the only one
who understands me.

1:05:57.829 --> 1:05:59.288
Deanna!

1:05:59.372 --> 1:06:01.541
Coming, Miss Celine!

1:06:02.208 --> 1:06:05.378
One, two, and three, and four, and five!

1:06:15.013 --> 1:06:18.517
Coffee here sucks.
I had to go three blocks to get this.

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:20.434
This is the biggest size they had, huh?

1:06:20.519 --> 1:06:23.437
-It's good to see you, kiddo.
-Thanks for squeezing me in.

1:06:23.522 --> 1:06:25.314
Oh. Always time for you.

1:06:26.357 --> 1:06:28.359
So, new office...

1:06:28.443 --> 1:06:30.945
-Yes, the cave.
-The cave?

1:06:31.029 --> 1:06:34.574
I call it the cave 'cause I caved.
I'm working in the family biz.

1:06:34.658 --> 1:06:37.994
It looks good on you.
New suit, sitting behind that desk...

1:06:38.077 --> 1:06:40.288
Knife to the heart, kid.
Knife to the heart.

1:06:42.206 --> 1:06:44.876
-So, how's G.G.?
-She's turning into a full-on Parisian.

1:06:44.959 --> 1:06:46.419
Got the baguette thing down.

1:06:46.503 --> 1:06:48.129
-Send her my love?
-I'll do that.

1:06:48.213 --> 1:06:50.423
And how's Lana?
Are you two still together?

1:06:50.507 --> 1:06:51.675
Why not?

1:06:52.801 --> 1:06:56.638
- How are you?
- Me? I'm five by five.

1:06:56.721 --> 1:07:00.058
- What?
- Oh... uh, sorry, it's, uh...

1:07:00.141 --> 1:07:03.853
I was watching a <i>Buffy</i> marathon
and some things stick.

1:07:03.937 --> 1:07:07.356
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-I can't come visit my father?

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:09.400
Any time.
It just seems a little formal.

1:07:09.484 --> 1:07:11.861
Like you're gonna serve me
with papers or something.

1:07:13.863 --> 1:07:15.949
Mom and Luke are getting married.
Did she tell you?

1:07:16.032 --> 1:07:19.077
I'm not real good at keeping up
with e-mail. So, maybe.

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:22.038
Well, it's a town thing,
and I thought you should know,

1:07:22.121 --> 1:07:24.082
-but I'm kind of hoping you won't--
-Show up?

1:07:24.165 --> 1:07:27.460
I won't. Knowing when to admit defeat
is one of my better qualities.

1:07:27.544 --> 1:07:29.838
I wish her all the happiness in the world.

1:07:29.921 --> 1:07:31.380
-Is she registered?
-As what?

1:07:31.464 --> 1:07:33.633
For gifts.
I have a crazy expense account here.

1:07:33.716 --> 1:07:35.510
I can get anything.
Does she have a unicorn?

1:07:35.594 --> 1:07:38.387
-Shoot! She got one yesterday.
-I'll think of something else.

1:07:39.598 --> 1:07:42.767
So, is that what the big news is?
The wedding?

1:07:43.977 --> 1:07:46.520
I'm switching gears a little.
Career-wise.

1:07:46.605 --> 1:07:49.482
The journalism thing didn't
really pan out the way I hoped.

1:07:49.566 --> 1:07:51.442
Sorry, kid.
Do you need some money?

1:07:51.526 --> 1:07:53.528
- No.
- You sure? 'Cause I have some.

1:07:53.611 --> 1:07:54.821
I have no idea what to do.

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:57.574
I bought this suit
and every color of Beats by Dre.

1:07:58.157 --> 1:08:00.493
-I'm writing a book.
-A book?

1:08:00.577 --> 1:08:02.411
I'm writing a book about me and Mom.

1:08:02.495 --> 1:08:04.664
Really? Does Lorelai know?

1:08:04.748 --> 1:08:06.207
-Yes.
-Does Lorelai care?

1:08:06.290 --> 1:08:08.126
-I'll find out.
-Am I in this book?

1:08:08.209 --> 1:08:11.504
-Well, it would be hard to avoid.
-Do I enter in a cloud of sulfur?

1:08:11.588 --> 1:08:14.173
I haven't worked out all the logistics.

1:08:14.257 --> 1:08:17.969
Okay, well, I...
I think it's great.

1:08:18.052 --> 1:08:20.930
Just...
try not to make me too big a villain.

1:08:21.014 --> 1:08:24.726
I was stupid, but I loved her. And you.

1:08:27.312 --> 1:08:29.856
-Can I ask you something?
-Anything.

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:32.191
How did you feel
about Mom raising me alone?

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:33.652
Ouch!

1:08:34.653 --> 1:08:36.738
You kind of coldcocked me there,
Mr. Bernstein.

1:08:36.821 --> 1:08:38.489
Sorry, I just have to know.

1:08:38.573 --> 1:08:40.825
How did you feel? What did you feel?

1:08:42.326 --> 1:08:45.288
Your mom did what she wanted to do.
I wasn't consulted.

1:08:45.371 --> 1:08:48.291
I know, but... you let her do it.

1:08:48.374 --> 1:08:50.418
I did. I... I let her do it.

1:08:50.501 --> 1:08:54.338
So, now, all these years later,
how do you feel about that?

1:08:54.422 --> 1:08:56.174
It was in the cards.

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:58.718
Lorelai and you, from the first moment
I saw you two together,

1:08:58.801 --> 1:09:00.637
no one was getting between you guys.

1:09:01.345 --> 1:09:03.181
Maybe that's why
she's getting married now.

1:09:03.264 --> 1:09:06.851
You're grown. Her job is done.
Now she can let someone else in.

1:09:06.935 --> 1:09:09.979
-She didn't let you in?
-I'm not saying that.

1:09:10.063 --> 1:09:11.105
Is that why you weren't there?

1:09:11.189 --> 1:09:13.650
She made the decision
and she pushed you away?

1:09:13.733 --> 1:09:16.235
Not at all. We were just so young.
I was so young,

1:09:16.319 --> 1:09:20.031
and Lorelai was, much like yourself,
she was a force of nature.

1:09:20.114 --> 1:09:22.200
Just uncontrollable.
Sure about everything.

1:09:22.283 --> 1:09:26.663
I couldn't come close to competing
with that, so I... didn't.

1:09:27.246 --> 1:09:30.166
You could've fought her on it.
You could've talked her out of it.

1:09:30.249 --> 1:09:32.043
You ever try talking her out of anything?

1:09:32.126 --> 1:09:35.629
But do you think it was the right decision
that she raised me alone?

1:09:35.713 --> 1:09:38.007
I think it was exactly
what was supposed to happen.

1:09:38.091 --> 1:09:39.801
And I think she'd back me up on that.

1:09:43.221 --> 1:09:46.474
Yeah. I think she would, too.

1:09:47.516 --> 1:09:49.102
You know I love you though, right?

1:09:51.437 --> 1:09:52.438
I know.

1:09:53.189 --> 1:09:54.899
Oh. Hold on.

1:09:54.983 --> 1:09:56.818
-You're working. I should...
-No, I...

1:09:59.779 --> 1:10:01.531
-Sorry, kiddo.
-That's okay.

1:10:01.614 --> 1:10:05.159
Let's meet up for dinner next week.
Tell me more about this book.

1:10:05.243 --> 1:10:06.660
Thanks for the coffee.

1:10:14.127 --> 1:10:15.669
I think the office is nice.

1:10:43.823 --> 1:10:45.158
Mom!

1:10:46.284 --> 1:10:47.786
Uh, what's with the--

1:10:47.869 --> 1:10:50.371
-Oh, my God! It's off!
-What's off?

1:10:50.454 --> 1:10:52.749
The wedding. It's off.
I knew it.

1:10:52.832 --> 1:10:55.418
I shouldn't have bought that dress
till the last minute.

1:10:55.501 --> 1:10:57.295
The wedding isn't off.
Why do you think that?

1:10:57.378 --> 1:10:58.755
-You're here.
-I'm here to talk.

1:10:58.838 --> 1:11:00.548
-About the wedding being off?
-It isn't off.

1:11:00.631 --> 1:11:02.759
You can tell me.
I don't have a deposit to lose.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:05.636
I didn't tell anyone
you were getting married for this reason.

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:07.430
-Good.
-There's no one to answer to.

1:11:07.513 --> 1:11:10.058
-I'm glad.
-I have no skin in this game.

1:11:10.141 --> 1:11:12.351
-I'm getting married.
-To Luke?

1:11:12.435 --> 1:11:15.855
-Hey! You're selling the house.
-What? Oh. Yes.

1:11:15.939 --> 1:11:18.274
-Are you kidding me?
-Why? Did you want it?

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:20.944
No! God, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

1:11:21.027 --> 1:11:23.196
-So, no?
-Sorry, but no.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:27.992
Since you and I don't want it,
I thought I'd sell it to someone who does.

1:11:28.076 --> 1:11:32.205
Or someone who'll pay me a lot of money
to tear it down. That's fine, too.

1:11:33.122 --> 1:11:35.708
"Show me the money!"
Have you seen <i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

1:11:35.792 --> 1:11:37.626
It was on Starz last night.
It's delightful.

1:11:37.710 --> 1:11:40.379
Mom, stop.
Please, why don't you want this house?

1:11:40.463 --> 1:11:42.506
Because it isn't home anymore.

1:11:42.590 --> 1:11:44.758
It hasn't been home
since your father died.

1:11:44.843 --> 1:11:47.053
And I've tried to change it, to adjust it,

1:11:47.136 --> 1:11:50.098
I've moved everything around...
but it hasn't worked.

1:11:50.181 --> 1:11:53.267
-What did you move around?
-What are you talking about?

1:11:53.351 --> 1:11:56.020
-Mom, it looks exactly the same.
-Oh, it does not.

1:11:56.104 --> 1:11:59.190
Other than the TV over there,
it's exactly the same as it was.

1:11:59.273 --> 1:12:02.693
-Are you blind?
-Nothing has changed in this house.

1:12:02.776 --> 1:12:06.114
Oh, for Pete's sake,
why do you make me...

1:12:06.197 --> 1:12:10.368
That was over there.
Those pillows were upstairs.

1:12:10.451 --> 1:12:13.621
The highball glasses
were on the top of the bar.

1:12:13.704 --> 1:12:16.207
There are no tongs
in the ice bucket anymore.

1:12:16.290 --> 1:12:18.877
These were ferns.
Now they're ficuses.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:21.212
You're right. No tongs. Where am I?

1:12:21.295 --> 1:12:22.380
Lorelai, go away.

1:12:22.463 --> 1:12:26.050
I have a real estate woman coming
to discuss photographing the house.

1:12:26.134 --> 1:12:28.219
I have no time to spar with you.

1:12:28.302 --> 1:12:30.680
But where are you gonna live?

1:12:32.932 --> 1:12:36.185
-Nantucket.
-What in the hell?

1:12:36.269 --> 1:12:38.646
Why is everything so dramatic with you?
I like Nantucket.

1:12:38.729 --> 1:12:41.774
But your whole world is here.
Your friends, the club, the DAR...

1:12:41.858 --> 1:12:43.776
- Those old bats!
- What?

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:45.611
-People move all the time.
-Not you.

1:12:45.694 --> 1:12:48.656
You don't move or change!
There's a picture of you in the attic

1:12:48.739 --> 1:12:51.075
that Dorian Gray is consulting
copyright lawyers about.

1:12:51.159 --> 1:12:53.327
Sometimes life forces your hand.

1:12:53.411 --> 1:12:56.080
Remember the house
your father and I rented every summer?

1:12:56.164 --> 1:12:57.706
-Of course.
-Well, I bought it.

1:12:57.790 --> 1:12:59.250
It wasn't even for sale.

1:12:59.333 --> 1:13:01.044
I just upped and pulled a Bugsy Siegel

1:13:01.127 --> 1:13:02.836
and made 'em an offer
they couldn't refuse.

1:13:02.921 --> 1:13:06.090
I think you mixed your mob metaphors,
but I appreciate the attempt.

1:13:06.174 --> 1:13:08.009
-I paid cash.
-You and Katy Perry.

1:13:08.092 --> 1:13:11.637
I saw what the house across the way
went for and doubled it.

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.222
You're a terrible businessman.

1:13:13.306 --> 1:13:16.017
They said yes in five minutes
and left the porch furniture.

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:17.894
Well, hooray for the bulldog.

1:13:17.977 --> 1:13:19.728
It was thrilling, actually.

1:13:19.812 --> 1:13:21.855
I've never bought anything big before.

1:13:21.940 --> 1:13:24.817
Your father bought this house
and our cars.

1:13:24.901 --> 1:13:28.279
All my credit cards still say,
"Mrs. Richard Gilmore."

1:13:28.362 --> 1:13:30.448
But the Sand Castle?

1:13:30.531 --> 1:13:33.409
The Sand Castle says,
"Owner: Emily Gilmore."

1:13:33.492 --> 1:13:34.577
Sand Castle?

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:37.163
Well, the previous owners
called it the Clam Shack.

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:38.872
I guess Vagina House was taken.

1:13:38.957 --> 1:13:40.541
Mmm, Sand Castle's nice.

1:13:40.624 --> 1:13:42.835
Now I've got my eye
on that house next door.

1:13:42.919 --> 1:13:45.129
I'd like to buy it
and get those Blackstone pricks out.

1:13:45.213 --> 1:13:47.881
What was the exact moment
you became a Mamet play?

1:13:47.966 --> 1:13:51.260
I've started having a sherry
every day in the afternoon.

1:13:51.344 --> 1:13:53.137
You can join me if you like.

1:13:53.220 --> 1:13:56.474
Mom? Uh, come... come, sit.

1:13:57.058 --> 1:14:00.269
-Why? Is there more?
-Just sit, please.

1:14:00.353 --> 1:14:03.772
What do you need, Lorelai?

1:14:03.856 --> 1:14:05.649
I need to expand the Dragonfly.

1:14:05.733 --> 1:14:07.651
I can't,
because there's wetlands on one side,

1:14:07.735 --> 1:14:11.072
and crazy town ordinances
and some weird lizard thing

1:14:11.155 --> 1:14:13.491
that spawns up in the north field
twice a century.

1:14:13.574 --> 1:14:15.784
I'm never gonna grow the business
or keep Michel

1:14:15.868 --> 1:14:19.580
unless I find another place,
an annex, and I found one.

1:14:19.663 --> 1:14:23.084
It was an old folks' home,
but they're selling it.

1:14:23.668 --> 1:14:24.627
You need money.

1:14:24.710 --> 1:14:27.338
-It's just the perfect opportunity...
-You need money.

1:14:27.421 --> 1:14:30.299
The nuns want to move it quickly.
I know there's interest and...

1:14:30.383 --> 1:14:32.718
I'm not sure
I can find another loan that fast.

1:14:32.801 --> 1:14:34.803
So... you need money.

1:14:35.972 --> 1:14:38.307
-Yes.
-I'll get the checkbook.

1:14:38.391 --> 1:14:42.811
But, Mom, I...
I wanna use Luke's franchise money.

1:14:44.022 --> 1:14:47.984
He doesn't want it.
It's just not who he is.

1:14:48.067 --> 1:14:50.153
Luke likes his empire small.

1:14:50.236 --> 1:14:54.282
And I know Dad left it to him,
and I wanna honor Dad's memory,

1:14:54.365 --> 1:14:56.825
but... maybe this could honor it, too.

1:14:58.786 --> 1:15:00.288
I'll call the lawyer.

1:15:01.289 --> 1:15:02.706
Really? Thank you.

1:15:02.790 --> 1:15:05.126
-On one condition.
-So close.

1:15:05.209 --> 1:15:07.836
I want you and Luke in Nantucket
two weeks every summer

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:09.463
and one week at Christmas.

1:15:09.547 --> 1:15:12.258
If all goes well, you'll be staying
in the Blackstone house next door.

1:15:12.341 --> 1:15:13.342
You're kidding.

1:15:13.426 --> 1:15:15.386
If you agree,
you'll have the money by morning.

1:15:15.469 --> 1:15:18.597
If you don't, you better figure out
a way to get rid of those lizards.

1:15:24.562 --> 1:15:25.896
To the circle of life.

1:15:32.111 --> 1:15:33.362
You look very happy.

1:15:34.238 --> 1:15:36.365
I am. I really am.

1:15:36.449 --> 1:15:39.243
Well, this is silly. We're celebrating.

1:15:39.327 --> 1:15:42.746
-I'm opening the '69 Dom Pérignon.
-Mmm.

1:16:07.271 --> 1:16:08.356
Okay. I'm moving.

1:16:08.439 --> 1:16:11.192
I have a million things
I need to do today as well.

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:13.069
I'm here.
What am I looking for?

1:16:13.152 --> 1:16:14.570
<i>Find the spray cheese.</i>

1:16:14.653 --> 1:16:16.447
- Got it.
<i>- Go down to the Red Vines.</i>

1:16:16.530 --> 1:16:17.865
-Got it.
<i>-Go two over from the oatmeal</i>

1:16:17.948 --> 1:16:20.826
<i>and up from the anchovy paste.</i>
<i>Find me some white safety pins.</i>

1:16:20.909 --> 1:16:23.954
What would white safety pins
be doing next to the... Got 'em.

1:16:24.037 --> 1:16:25.123
<i>And grab a stain stick.</i>

1:16:25.206 --> 1:16:27.375
<i>I'm picking up my dress.</i>
<i>I'll meet you at the inn.</i>

1:16:27.458 --> 1:16:29.042
I'll see you then.

1:16:29.127 --> 1:16:31.337
-Oh, sorry.
-Oh! Hey!

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:34.132
Well, well, well,
of all the gin joints in all the world.

1:16:34.215 --> 1:16:35.466
-Hey.
-It's so good to see you.

1:16:35.549 --> 1:16:38.136
-You, too.
-What are you doing in Stars Hollow?

1:16:38.219 --> 1:16:40.096
I'm visiting my parents for the weekend.

1:16:40.179 --> 1:16:41.680
-That's nice.
-It's very nice.

1:16:41.764 --> 1:16:44.391
Especially since Grady
brought home the flu and head lice

1:16:44.475 --> 1:16:46.352
-from his first day at school.
-Oh, man.

1:16:46.435 --> 1:16:48.437
Within 24 hours,
all three kids had everything.

1:16:48.521 --> 1:16:49.772
It's ugly, man.

1:16:49.855 --> 1:16:51.690
Jenny told me
to save myself while I could.

1:16:51.774 --> 1:16:53.317
-She's a saint.
-She's pregnant.

1:16:53.401 --> 1:16:55.611
-Again?
-It's really boring in Scranton.

1:16:55.694 --> 1:16:57.363
Man, your house is gonna be loud.

1:16:57.446 --> 1:16:58.739
-I know.
-That's so great.

1:16:58.822 --> 1:17:00.116
-I know.
-Congrats.

1:17:00.199 --> 1:17:03.202
It's a girl, so my sister
finally has someone to shop for.

1:17:03.286 --> 1:17:04.453
How is Clara?

1:17:04.537 --> 1:17:06.164
She's in Berlin
with a guy named Wolfgang.

1:17:06.247 --> 1:17:07.540
-Van Halen?
-I wish.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:10.000
He's from Buffalo.
He climbs things for a living.

1:17:10.083 --> 1:17:12.002
Climbs things like big piles of money?

1:17:12.085 --> 1:17:15.381
Nope. Like bridges, municipal buildings.

1:17:15.464 --> 1:17:18.301
They stacked up tires
for the monster truck rally,

1:17:18.384 --> 1:17:20.719
and he climbed them
dressed as an ignition switch.

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:24.056
-I don't know how to defend that.
-And he calls her Ra.

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:25.849
That's the great nickname he came up with.

1:17:25.933 --> 1:17:28.394
-You hate him.
-I hate him.

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:32.022
Well, it's okay. She's young.
It's her first love. It'll probably...

1:17:34.275 --> 1:17:37.778
Yeah, I know.
Um...

1:17:37.861 --> 1:17:39.029
-Well--
-How're you doing?

1:17:39.112 --> 1:17:41.824
Um... me?
I'm doing okay.

1:17:41.907 --> 1:17:43.367
Just okay?

1:17:43.451 --> 1:17:45.578
Things are changing for me
at the moment.

1:17:45.661 --> 1:17:48.080
I'm still trying to figure it out.
I'm writing a book.

1:17:48.164 --> 1:17:50.499
You've read 'em all,
so what else are you gonna do?

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:51.750
Mmm-hmm.

1:17:51.834 --> 1:17:54.378
Uh, it's actually about my mom
and me and our life.

1:17:54.462 --> 1:17:57.005
-Really?
-Can I put you in it?

1:17:57.965 --> 1:17:59.800
-Uh...
-I mean, I'm changing the names

1:17:59.883 --> 1:18:02.595
to protect the guilty,
but you would know it's you.

1:18:03.721 --> 1:18:06.932
I don't know.
Um... what're you gonna say?

1:18:07.516 --> 1:18:11.103
That... you were
the greatest boyfriend alive.

1:18:11.187 --> 1:18:13.564
That you were, um...

1:18:13.939 --> 1:18:16.650
generous, and protective,
and kind and strong.

1:18:16.734 --> 1:18:20.196
That as much as I wish we'd met
when I was older and more mature,

1:18:20.279 --> 1:18:23.282
if I hadn't had you with me then,
I wouldn't be the person I am today.

1:18:23.366 --> 1:18:26.535
That you taught me what safe feels like.

1:18:31.499 --> 1:18:32.541
Okay.

1:18:32.625 --> 1:18:35.043
And that you had an obsession
with <i>Lord of the Rings,</i>

1:18:35.127 --> 1:18:37.004
that you did a terrible
Sméagol impression...

1:18:37.087 --> 1:18:38.464
It was not terrible.

1:18:38.547 --> 1:18:40.966
It was pretty damn good.
There were hand gestures.

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:42.260
I know, I remember.

1:18:42.343 --> 1:18:44.720
I remember it all really well.

1:18:47.139 --> 1:18:49.475
-Good luck with the book.
-Thank you.

1:18:52.853 --> 1:18:54.021
Dean!

1:18:55.814 --> 1:18:56.899
Cornstarch.

1:18:56.982 --> 1:18:59.818
Pay for it this time.

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:07.200
Michel? Oh.
Hey, I'm gonna raid the kitchen.

1:19:07.284 --> 1:19:08.744
Give me a shout when Rory gets here?

1:19:08.827 --> 1:19:11.914
Mmm-hmm, I live for moments like these.

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:18.211
Sookie.

1:19:23.050 --> 1:19:24.260
Sookie?

1:19:25.344 --> 1:19:27.179
Sookie?

1:19:28.639 --> 1:19:31.934
-Oh, jeez!
-Oh... wow, that was pornographic.

1:19:32.017 --> 1:19:34.812
Hey, give a gal some warning.

1:19:34.895 --> 1:19:36.689
What?
I've been calling your name.

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:37.815
-When?
-Now.

1:19:37.898 --> 1:19:39.191
-No.
-Yes.

1:19:39.275 --> 1:19:42.152
Well, my hearing's not so good right now.

1:19:42.235 --> 1:19:44.613
I set off one of Jackson's bear traps
the other night,

1:19:44.697 --> 1:19:46.532
and the alarm went off right in my ear.

1:19:46.615 --> 1:19:48.451
-His what?
-Bear trap, yeah.

1:19:48.534 --> 1:19:50.869
He's reading
<i>Little House in the Big Woods</i> to Martha.

1:19:50.953 --> 1:19:53.372
He got to the part
where Ma goes to check on...

1:19:53.455 --> 1:19:55.040
The horses.
She thought that the cow--

1:19:55.124 --> 1:19:56.667
-Had gotten out...
-But it's not.

1:19:56.750 --> 1:19:57.751
She smacks him on the nose,

1:19:57.835 --> 1:19:59.128
-but it's a bear.
-It's a bear.

1:19:59.211 --> 1:20:00.879
It's a bear!

1:20:00.963 --> 1:20:04.925
So, now, you know, Jackson thinks
that everything outside is a bear,

1:20:05.008 --> 1:20:07.636
and he's rigged the entire property
with bear traps

1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:10.473
that blast "Welcome To The Jungle"
if you trip them off,

1:20:10.556 --> 1:20:13.392
and I'm out chasing Cogburn,
our rooster, and then <i>voilà!</i>

1:20:13.476 --> 1:20:15.686
You know, Panama all over again.

1:20:15.769 --> 1:20:18.647
It was so loud
that the neighboring farm heard it.

1:20:18.731 --> 1:20:21.066
They call the police.
I had to wait till I got out of jail

1:20:21.149 --> 1:20:23.361
to tell Jackson,
"You gotta get rid of this stuff."

1:20:23.444 --> 1:20:24.487
Jail?

1:20:24.570 --> 1:20:26.947
The cops thought
that I had broken into our house.

1:20:27.030 --> 1:20:28.366
-Why?
-Well, when they asked me

1:20:28.449 --> 1:20:31.284
-if I had broken into it, I said yes.
-Why?

1:20:31.369 --> 1:20:34.121
I thought they said,
"Do you have pineapple juice?" and I did.

1:20:34.204 --> 1:20:35.331
Ah.

1:20:35.414 --> 1:20:37.458
So... what do you think?

1:20:37.541 --> 1:20:40.836
Sookie... what is all this?

1:20:41.962 --> 1:20:44.632
This is... your wedding cake.

1:20:44.715 --> 1:20:47.926
Or this is your wedding cake.

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:50.763
-Ah!
-Or... or this is your wedding cake.

1:20:50.846 --> 1:20:52.640
This was going to be your wedding cake,

1:20:52.723 --> 1:20:55.017
but then this became your wedding cake.

1:20:55.100 --> 1:20:58.020
I couldn't decide.
But, I mean, this is your Luke wedding.

1:20:58.103 --> 1:21:00.731
So, I just,
I really wanted it to say Luke...

1:21:00.814 --> 1:21:02.107
Oh, look.

1:21:02.190 --> 1:21:04.777
- This one actually says "Luke."
- Amazing.

1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:06.862
And this one has hats on it,
if you like that.

1:21:06.945 --> 1:21:10.449
This one has daisies.
This one has cakes on top of the cake.

1:21:10.532 --> 1:21:13.160
I mean, this one if you want a classic,
or... but...

1:21:14.870 --> 1:21:17.831
This one is my favorite.
This is your milestone cake.

1:21:17.915 --> 1:21:21.251
Look, there's you and baby Rory
made out of frosting.

1:21:21.334 --> 1:21:22.753
Just like in real life.

1:21:22.836 --> 1:21:24.046
There's your house and Jeep,

1:21:24.129 --> 1:21:27.883
and that's the hospital
where you took me the day we met.

1:21:27.966 --> 1:21:29.427
Oh, my God, is that--

1:21:29.510 --> 1:21:31.679
-My finger tip.
-Aw!

1:21:31.762 --> 1:21:34.014
You scooped it up
and threw it in your purse.

1:21:34.097 --> 1:21:35.516
That was a brand new purse, FYI.

1:21:35.599 --> 1:21:38.310
We went to the hospital
and the doctor sewed it back on.

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:40.270
And you cut it right off again
two days later.

1:21:40.353 --> 1:21:43.273
-It kind of became our thing.
-Yeah.

1:21:43.356 --> 1:21:44.733
Michel, look who's here!

1:21:44.817 --> 1:21:47.778
-You bitch!
-Oh, he hasn't changed at all.

1:21:47.861 --> 1:21:48.862
Two years?

1:21:48.946 --> 1:21:51.574
Two years before you deign
to waltz back in here.

1:21:51.657 --> 1:21:53.867
-I don't think I waltzed--
-No! I talk now!

1:21:53.951 --> 1:21:56.119
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1:21:56.203 --> 1:21:58.997
-Forget what you've done to this hot mess.
-Thanks, Michel.

1:21:59.081 --> 1:22:02.585
Turning her into a sighing, moping,
broken shell of a person

1:22:02.668 --> 1:22:04.503
who won't let anyone park in your space

1:22:04.587 --> 1:22:08.131
even though it is right next to
the back door and other people's aren't.

1:22:08.215 --> 1:22:09.299
-I don't think--
-Not done!

1:22:09.382 --> 1:22:12.260
And when you left
on your amazing journey upstate,

1:22:12.344 --> 1:22:14.888
you took your fat-free
magic granola with you.

1:22:14.972 --> 1:22:18.642
I... brought a vat of it.
It's in the back.

1:22:18.726 --> 1:22:22.229
Oh, really?
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

1:22:22.312 --> 1:22:25.608
Send my love to Jackson and the kids.
Is it right here? Right...

1:22:27.735 --> 1:22:30.696
Michel is exaggerating.
I'm not broken.

1:22:31.947 --> 1:22:33.365
Maybe just a little chipped.

1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:37.369
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

1:22:38.286 --> 1:22:40.623
'Cause we were
supposed to do this together.

1:22:40.706 --> 1:22:43.333
We did do this together.
Look around.

1:22:45.293 --> 1:22:47.671
-It's a pretty great inn.
-It sure is.

1:22:48.631 --> 1:22:52.510
I miss it. I mean, I love...
I love what I'm doing.

1:22:52.593 --> 1:22:54.344
You know, it's fascinating.

1:22:54.427 --> 1:22:57.347
Did you know that
I can tell the alkaline levels of soil

1:22:57.430 --> 1:22:59.224
-just by tasting it?
-I did not.

1:22:59.307 --> 1:23:01.059
There are moments where I'm looking around

1:23:01.143 --> 1:23:04.897
and just watching a bunch of people
eat dirt and I think...

1:23:05.981 --> 1:23:09.109
"Jonestown definitely started like this."

1:23:09.192 --> 1:23:12.320
Well, if they start
passing around Kool-Aid,

1:23:12.404 --> 1:23:13.656
you can always come back.

1:23:14.573 --> 1:23:15.949
Still best friends?

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:18.661
Still best friends.

1:23:22.414 --> 1:23:25.458
- What's that?
- What's what?

1:23:28.629 --> 1:23:29.672
What is...

1:23:29.755 --> 1:23:31.256
What is that?
Is that...

1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:33.550
There's a smell. Is that abalone?

1:23:33.634 --> 1:23:34.927
Uh, maybe.

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:37.345
Oh, I can't believe
you let Roy Choi in my...

1:23:37.429 --> 1:23:40.265
And what... what is that?
That's Ina Garten.

1:23:40.348 --> 1:23:41.767
-No!
-No?

1:23:41.850 --> 1:23:46.438
Is that not lime tequila chicken? Huh?
I've been gone like five minutes.

1:23:46.522 --> 1:23:48.231
-Two years.
-Whatever!

1:23:48.315 --> 1:23:50.901
I mean, now I'm...
Now I... What?

1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:53.361
That's sammies!

1:23:53.445 --> 1:23:54.655
-Huh?
-Uh...

1:23:54.738 --> 1:23:56.448
Sammies all around!

1:23:56.990 --> 1:23:59.952
If Rachael Ray reorganized my pantry,
I'm gonna blow.

1:24:00.035 --> 1:24:01.286
Hey! Knock first!

1:24:01.369 --> 1:24:03.664
You're eating my granola
with your hands?

1:24:03.747 --> 1:24:05.373
There are no spoons in here.

1:24:05.457 --> 1:24:06.917
The granola's half gone!

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.336
Stop judging me,
you crazy log lady!

1:24:09.419 --> 1:24:11.254
Slow down!
You're gonna choke!

1:24:11.338 --> 1:24:12.715
Give it back!

1:24:12.798 --> 1:24:13.799
-This is mine--
-No! Ow!

1:24:16.176 --> 1:24:17.678
Hello, Alejandro.

1:24:20.097 --> 1:24:22.474
Berta, what are you doing out of bed?

1:24:22.558 --> 1:24:24.726
You go to bed right now.
I'll heat some soup.

1:24:24.810 --> 1:24:26.103
Oh, no.

1:24:26.186 --> 1:24:29.189
Every time you heat soup it boils over
and I can't get it off the stove.

1:24:29.272 --> 1:24:30.774
I won't hear any more arguing.

1:24:30.858 --> 1:24:32.400
Go back to bed.
Go on.

1:24:32.484 --> 1:24:34.778
Okay.
It's your stove.

1:24:34.862 --> 1:24:36.488
How a grown woman goes through life

1:24:36.572 --> 1:24:38.782
without being able
to heat something up is incredible.

1:24:38.865 --> 1:24:39.950
Hello?

1:24:40.659 --> 1:24:43.453
Yes, Sidney. I'm on my way.

1:24:43.536 --> 1:24:46.582
I just need to heat up some soup,
and then I'm out the door.

1:24:46.665 --> 1:24:47.666
See you soon.

1:24:57.009 --> 1:25:00.721
He plunges his barbed harpoon
into the whale's back.

1:25:00.804 --> 1:25:02.139
Then with the killing irons,

1:25:02.222 --> 1:25:04.933
they stab the great beast
repeatedly in the neck...

1:25:05.017 --> 1:25:06.393
to stop it diving

1:25:06.476 --> 1:25:09.312
and make it bleed to death all the faster.

1:25:09.396 --> 1:25:12.608
They then cut the tail tendons,
immobilizing the whale.

1:25:12.691 --> 1:25:15.944
Later in history,
they'll invent an explosive lance

1:25:16.028 --> 1:25:17.863
that combines the stabbing of the lance

1:25:17.946 --> 1:25:20.783
with an explosive that detonates
once inside the whale.

1:25:20.866 --> 1:25:24.703
But at this point,
it's just lots and lots of stabbing.

1:25:24.787 --> 1:25:29.582
Well, by now, the whale is spouting
buckets and buckets and buckets of blood.

1:25:29.667 --> 1:25:31.376
I'll give you all a moment.

1:25:37.507 --> 1:25:40.636
Wow, where's Right Said Fred
when you need 'em?

1:25:40.719 --> 1:25:43.555
Guy who sold me this suit gave me this.
I don't know what to do with it.

1:25:43.639 --> 1:25:46.016
-It's a pocket square. Do the math.
-Oh.

1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:48.852
Oh, it looks kind of nice.

1:25:48.936 --> 1:25:50.896
So this is the big outfit for tomorrow.

1:25:50.979 --> 1:25:52.773
-Get it all out now.
-Turn around.

1:25:52.856 --> 1:25:54.357
-Jess...
-Turn.

1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:00.864
-Well?
-You are a very handsome man.

1:26:00.948 --> 1:26:02.407
-All right.
-I mean, very hot.

1:26:02.490 --> 1:26:03.992
-I got it.
-Rande Gerber hot.

1:26:04.076 --> 1:26:05.410
-Enough, Jess.
-Hey.

1:26:05.911 --> 1:26:08.121
-You look good.
-Yeah?

1:26:08.205 --> 1:26:10.582
I only do sincere once, man.

1:26:10.666 --> 1:26:13.001
- Right, thanks.
- Luke!

1:26:13.085 --> 1:26:15.963
-Everything's under control!
-What happened to knocking?

1:26:16.046 --> 1:26:17.923
-What if we were naked?
-Don't say that.

1:26:18.006 --> 1:26:19.758
-Everything's under control.
-Where're you going?

1:26:19.842 --> 1:26:21.844
-To throw up.
-There's a bathroom down here.

1:26:21.927 --> 1:26:23.053
I wanna throw up upstairs.

1:26:23.136 --> 1:26:24.680
I don't want you throwing up
in either bathroom.

1:26:24.763 --> 1:26:26.890
But the tile downstairs kills my knees.

1:26:26.973 --> 1:26:28.975
-He's got a point.
-I've thrown up in both,

1:26:29.059 --> 1:26:30.560
so I know what I'm talking about.

1:26:30.643 --> 1:26:32.395
Kirk, what the hell is going on?

1:26:32.479 --> 1:26:35.482
-I've destroyed your wedding. Sorry.
-Destroyed? How?

1:26:35.565 --> 1:26:37.359
The decorations in the town square.

1:26:37.442 --> 1:26:39.569
Lorelai said to piggyback
on the Harvest Festival,

1:26:39.652 --> 1:26:41.404
with the hay bales and food carts,

1:26:41.488 --> 1:26:44.825
and I was only supposed
to set up a table for gifts and leave,

1:26:44.908 --> 1:26:47.703
-and I intended to. I really did.
-But?

1:26:47.786 --> 1:26:49.204
But I was taking Petal for a walk.

1:26:49.287 --> 1:26:51.373
She took longer than usual
to pick her spot.

1:26:51.456 --> 1:26:55.210
-Sure.
-I was looking around and I got an idea!

1:26:55.293 --> 1:26:57.170
I never get ideas! But I had one.

1:26:57.254 --> 1:26:58.505
And the next thing I knew,

1:26:58.588 --> 1:27:01.174
I bought a glitter gun
and some double stick tape,

1:27:01.258 --> 1:27:03.343
and two hours later, it's all different!

1:27:03.426 --> 1:27:05.971
Totally different.
I ruined your big day.

1:27:06.054 --> 1:27:09.266
-Kirk, relax.
-I wish Petal was here with me.

1:27:09.349 --> 1:27:11.769
She's a great source of comfort
in times of stress.

1:27:11.852 --> 1:27:15.647
Plus, if I vomit and miss the toilet,
she's there to make it disappear.

1:27:15.731 --> 1:27:16.899
Stop talking.

1:27:17.816 --> 1:27:19.609
What the hell are you doing here?

1:27:19.693 --> 1:27:21.278
I live here. You look hot.

1:27:21.361 --> 1:27:22.946
-Rande Gerber hot.
-Yeah.

1:27:23.030 --> 1:27:26.241
-You should be at the inn.
-I was. They don't have Pop-Tarts.

1:27:26.324 --> 1:27:27.492
-Get out of here.
-Why?

1:27:27.575 --> 1:27:30.078
The wedding's tomorrow.
I shouldn't see you. It's bad luck.

1:27:30.162 --> 1:27:31.163
Oh, are we doing that?

1:27:31.246 --> 1:27:32.789
-What's the hoopla?
-Why is she here?

1:27:32.873 --> 1:27:34.166
-She lives here?
-I tried that.

1:27:34.249 --> 1:27:35.667
You shouldn't see
the bride before the wedding.

1:27:35.751 --> 1:27:37.836
-Are we doing that?
-Yes, we are doing that.

1:27:37.919 --> 1:27:40.714
Did the discussion regarding
how this day was going to work

1:27:40.797 --> 1:27:41.965
go out of your head?

1:27:42.049 --> 1:27:44.092
-Yeah.
-Kinda. What's with Kirk?

1:27:44.176 --> 1:27:47.387
He freaked out and decided to vomit
in our upstairs bathroom.

1:27:47.471 --> 1:27:49.139
The downstairs is hard on his knees.

1:27:49.222 --> 1:27:50.265
-Tart?
-Please.

1:27:50.348 --> 1:27:53.727
You can't be here. It's bad luck.
Why am I the only one who gets this?

1:27:53.811 --> 1:27:55.312
Okay, we'll go.

1:27:55.395 --> 1:27:57.981
We're not even married
and the honeymoon's already over.

1:27:58.065 --> 1:28:00.859
Thanks for not telling her
that her special day has been ruined.

1:28:00.942 --> 1:28:02.486
- No problem.
- We're leaving!

1:28:02.569 --> 1:28:04.780
Bye-bye.

1:28:04.863 --> 1:28:08.116
You guys pretended to leave
and you're sitting there eating, right?

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:09.409
No.

1:28:10.368 --> 1:28:12.454
I never pegged Luke
as being a traditionalist.

1:28:12.537 --> 1:28:15.999
I know. There's more to learn
about that man yet.

1:28:17.542 --> 1:28:18.543
Ooh.

1:28:19.461 --> 1:28:20.462
What?

1:28:23.924 --> 1:28:24.925
Here.

1:28:25.843 --> 1:28:28.386
You read it.

1:28:28.470 --> 1:28:29.471
No, I didn't.

1:28:30.263 --> 1:28:32.099
-You--
-I'm not gonna read it.

1:28:32.682 --> 1:28:35.936
You go ahead and finish it.
I'll read it when it's done.

1:28:36.895 --> 1:28:37.938
Are you sure?

1:28:38.021 --> 1:28:39.772
If I don't like it, I'll sue your ass.

1:28:39.857 --> 1:28:43.235
Wow.
It's... it's good publicity.

1:28:43.318 --> 1:28:45.612
-Sue me either way?
-You got it.

1:28:46.822 --> 1:28:49.199
-Thanks, Mom.
-Yeah.

1:28:54.537 --> 1:28:57.290
Oh... just one note.

1:28:58.291 --> 1:29:03.005
Drop the "the." Just <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>
It's cleaner.

1:29:07.884 --> 1:29:09.261
<i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

1:29:09.761 --> 1:29:11.679
We're gonna order a pizza.
Any requests?

1:29:11.763 --> 1:29:13.806
- Go away!
- With extra cheese?

1:29:13.891 --> 1:29:16.434
Hey, listen,
you guys have a full house here,

1:29:16.518 --> 1:29:17.978
so I'm just gonna take off.

1:29:18.061 --> 1:29:20.063
-No, you don't have to.
-It's no problem.

1:29:20.147 --> 1:29:23.108
I'll go crash with Liz and T.J.
See you guys tomorrow.

1:29:30.740 --> 1:29:32.284
Liz got a bed there for you?

1:29:32.367 --> 1:29:35.370
No bed, but a lot of couches.
Not sure why.

1:29:36.329 --> 1:29:37.998
-Be back at 10:00?
-Jess...

1:29:38.081 --> 1:29:41.418
Jess, look.
The first three chapters!

1:29:47.465 --> 1:29:50.760
-What was that all about?
-Oh... just a thing between us.

1:29:50.843 --> 1:29:53.180
-Between you?
-A work thing between us.

1:29:53.263 --> 1:29:56.891
Work thing, huh?
So then you're over that, right?

1:29:56.975 --> 1:29:58.518
Yup, long over.

1:29:58.601 --> 1:30:00.979
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

1:30:01.062 --> 1:30:03.607
Can't wait to see
if you're gonna wear that pocket square.

1:30:40.268 --> 1:30:41.728
-Last piece.
-Please.

1:30:41.811 --> 1:30:44.481
Come on! We're gonna be married.
This is what married people do.

1:30:44.564 --> 1:30:46.024
Force-feed each other like veal?

1:30:46.108 --> 1:30:48.610
-Yes, I look at you, I see veal.
-Take it.

1:30:48.693 --> 1:30:50.070
All right, fine.

1:30:50.153 --> 1:30:54.116
If we're ever stuck on the Donner Pass
and have to eat our chuck wagon driver,

1:30:54.199 --> 1:30:56.743
I would give you the first bite,
'cause we are married now.

1:30:56.826 --> 1:31:01.248
- Almost married.
- Almost married.

1:31:01.331 --> 1:31:03.000
-I feel weird.
-I know.

1:31:03.083 --> 1:31:05.585
-Should we drink?
-Yes. No. I don't know.

1:31:05.668 --> 1:31:09.047
- What if we smell all boozy?
- Well, we'll shower.

1:31:09.131 --> 1:31:11.424
But it comes out your pores
and people can tell.

1:31:11.508 --> 1:31:13.510
How much will we drink?
We're not vaudevillians.

1:31:13.593 --> 1:31:15.428
I know. I'm just jittery.

1:31:15.512 --> 1:31:17.389
-Second thoughts?
-No, you?

1:31:17.472 --> 1:31:20.267
No, no, no, no, no.
I just... I have things planned.

1:31:20.350 --> 1:31:22.102
- I know.
- You do? How do you know?

1:31:22.185 --> 1:31:23.853
I just figured.
I do, too.

1:31:23.936 --> 1:31:25.355
-You have things planned?
-Yep.

1:31:25.438 --> 1:31:27.982
What? No creepy vows.
We promised no creepy vows.

1:31:28.066 --> 1:31:29.734
I'm not planning creepy vows.

1:31:29.817 --> 1:31:32.362
"Do you take her? Do you take him?"
"Yes." "Yes."

1:31:32.445 --> 1:31:34.239
And bam!
Step on the glass. Let's eat.

1:31:34.322 --> 1:31:36.241
-You step on a glass?
-Don't we have to?

1:31:36.324 --> 1:31:37.575
-We're not Jewish.
-Aren't we?

1:31:37.659 --> 1:31:38.994
What do you have planned?

1:31:39.077 --> 1:31:40.328
-Flash mob.
-You're kidding!

1:31:40.412 --> 1:31:42.580
Been rehearsing
Miss Patty's girls all week.

1:31:42.664 --> 1:31:45.542
They wear T-shirts with your face on them.
You're gonna hate it.

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:47.544
- What song?
- "Relax, Don't Do It."

1:31:47.627 --> 1:31:49.879
-Frankie Goes to Hollywood.
-I'm doing a flash mob, too.

1:31:49.962 --> 1:31:52.257
-Shut up! What song?
-"Hey, Nineteen."

1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:53.966
-"Hey, Nineteen"?
-Steely Dan.

1:31:54.051 --> 1:31:56.303
You're doing a flash mob
to Steely Dan?

1:31:56.386 --> 1:31:58.722
-I like Steely Dan.
-You can't do a flash mob to Steely Dan.

1:31:58.805 --> 1:32:00.640
-Why not?
-Well, it's old boring man music.

1:32:00.723 --> 1:32:02.142
It's not old boring man music.

1:32:02.225 --> 1:32:04.977
What does your flash mob do?
Jump out, lose their hair,

1:32:05.062 --> 1:32:06.604
complain about their backs
and doze off?

1:32:06.688 --> 1:32:08.648
-Hey, my flash mob, my song pick.
-Fine.

1:32:08.731 --> 1:32:10.233
I went to a rehearsal.
It was awful.

1:32:10.317 --> 1:32:13.153
'Cause you can't flash mob
to Steely Dan.

1:32:13.236 --> 1:32:15.280
Lot of pressure.
All those people staring at us.

1:32:15.363 --> 1:32:18.700
Waiting to be entertained,
which they won't, 'cause Steely Dan.

1:32:18.783 --> 1:32:20.327
You're exhausting.

1:32:20.410 --> 1:32:22.287
I feel like we should be married already.

1:32:22.370 --> 1:32:23.705
-Yes.
-Right?

1:32:23.788 --> 1:32:27.792
Tomorrow's this big stress-filled party
that everybody can enjoy but us.

1:32:27.875 --> 1:32:31.796
-Mmm. It'll be fine once we say "I do."
-We should've eloped.

1:32:31.879 --> 1:32:33.756
Then we could've had
the big dance-off wedding.

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:34.924
Then the pressure's off.

1:32:35.008 --> 1:32:37.052
Agreed.
Steely Dan still would've sucked.

1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:41.681
What?

1:32:43.350 --> 1:32:45.352
-It's bingo night.
-So?

1:32:46.519 --> 1:32:49.147
Reverend Skinner's up
awfully late on bingo night.

1:32:54.486 --> 1:32:57.030
Hey, kid. Wake up.

1:32:57.114 --> 1:32:59.324
-More pizza?
-No.

1:32:59.407 --> 1:33:01.868
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

1:33:02.118 --> 1:33:03.661
We're going to get married.

1:33:04.287 --> 1:33:05.205
-Now?
-Now.

1:33:05.705 --> 1:33:08.291
-What about tomorrow?
-We'll get married then, too.

1:33:09.292 --> 1:33:11.753
- What about him?
- Oh, let the boy sleep.

1:37:13.786 --> 1:37:15.913
- Steely Dan?
- I know.

1:37:15.997 --> 1:37:17.624
Who flash mobs to Steely Dan?

1:37:17.707 --> 1:37:19.125
-Luke.
-Luke.

1:37:20.460 --> 1:37:23.463
It's fine. I texted Patty.
She'll switch it to "Karma Chameleon."

1:37:23.546 --> 1:37:25.006
-Without telling him?
-Yeah.

1:37:25.089 --> 1:37:26.674
-Oh, man. That's going to be good.
-Yep.

1:37:26.758 --> 1:37:29.386
Aren't you curious what
a Steely Dan flash mob would look like?

1:37:29.469 --> 1:37:30.887
-No.
-Me either.

1:37:32.096 --> 1:37:34.181
So, how does it feel?

1:37:36.308 --> 1:37:37.519
It feels...

1:37:38.728 --> 1:37:41.398
- right.
- Yeah.

1:37:41.481 --> 1:37:43.691
Such a long time getting here.

1:37:44.233 --> 1:37:46.069
Sometimes it's just a journey, you know?

1:37:46.152 --> 1:37:50.072
Yeah. I guess so.

1:37:50.156 --> 1:37:53.701
-I think I'm gonna be very good at this.
-At being married?

1:37:53.785 --> 1:37:55.369
No, at finishing off this bottle.

1:37:55.453 --> 1:37:57.914
Oh, no doubt in my mind.

1:37:57.997 --> 1:38:00.708
Now that I'm a married lady,
you should be one, too.

1:38:00.792 --> 1:38:02.001
You are of age.

1:38:02.084 --> 1:38:04.086
Then we could do
married-lady things together.

1:38:04.170 --> 1:38:05.713
What are married-lady things?

1:38:05.797 --> 1:38:08.883
I don't know, like, uh...
dyeing our hair blue

1:38:08.966 --> 1:38:11.511
or... buying pork chops.

1:38:11.594 --> 1:38:13.304
-Bowling? I'm out.
-I don't know.

1:38:13.388 --> 1:38:16.307
I thought I'd be the spinster daughter
who stays home and looks after Mama.

1:38:16.391 --> 1:38:17.683
No, I've got Kirk for that.

1:38:17.767 --> 1:38:20.603
Let me see.
Who can we marry you off to?

1:38:20.687 --> 1:38:21.854
Ooh, I know!

1:38:21.938 --> 1:38:25.733
-Did that nice Pee-wee Herman find a lady?
-I think no's a pretty safe bet.

1:38:25.817 --> 1:38:27.902
You wanted to marry him
when you were little.

1:38:27.985 --> 1:38:31.322
I also wanted to marry Edward Scissorhands
and Jerry Orbach from <i>Law & Order.</i>

1:38:31.405 --> 1:38:33.157
Your taste ran the gamut.

1:38:36.410 --> 1:38:39.080
"Rory,
due to our ever-conflicting schedules,

1:38:39.163 --> 1:38:41.916
I think we should break up.
Take care, Paul."

1:38:42.375 --> 1:38:43.543
Who?

1:38:43.626 --> 1:38:47.046
I can't believe how I treated him.
I suck.

1:38:47.129 --> 1:38:48.422
No, you don't.

1:38:49.799 --> 1:38:51.133
It didn't fit.

1:38:52.343 --> 1:38:54.929
It needs to fit. Believe me.

1:38:55.805 --> 1:38:59.058
-He'll find someone amazing one day.
-Yeah.

1:39:01.561 --> 1:39:03.104
And so will you.

1:39:10.820 --> 1:39:13.865
Hey.
What's going on in there?

1:39:16.075 --> 1:39:17.743
I wanna remember it all.

1:39:18.578 --> 1:39:19.871
Every detail.

1:39:25.001 --> 1:39:26.753
Mom.

1:39:27.670 --> 1:39:28.880
Yeah?

1:39:31.298 --> 1:39:32.634
I'm pregnant.
