<i>In front of a live</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:06.839
I can't believe
you left that guy my number.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.173
You weren't going to.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.576
Because he drives a minivan
with a dent in it.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.078
You were the one
who dented it.
Wait. W-w-wait. Hold it.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.580
Mandy,
you dented a car?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.714
A parked car.

00:15.716 --> 00:19.251
In her defense, she was swerving
to avoid a tree.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.586
And you weren't
gonna leave a note?

00:20.588 --> 00:21.754
Oh, what was
I supposed to say?

00:21.756 --> 00:23.589
"uh, sorry
that I hit your car.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.224
Uh, here's my number."

00:25.226 --> 00:27.092
Yes.
Yes.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.260
Okay, if I had to stop

00:28.262 --> 00:30.462
And leave notes on everything
that I've banged into,

00:30.464 --> 00:32.464
I would
never get anywhere.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.299
Come on, Mandy.
You know better than that.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.402
W-what's your dad
always going on and on about?

00:36.404 --> 00:38.904
Mm, obama, benghazi,
"when are the yekekians

00:38.906 --> 00:41.240
Going to take down
their christmas lights?"

00:41.242 --> 00:42.908
Personal
responsibility.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.109
Oh, right.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.111
I think that part kind of
gets lost in all the crazy.

00:46.113 --> 00:47.479
Hey, hey.
Hi.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.048
What the heck
happened to your car?

00:49.050 --> 00:50.416
[ chuckles ]
you should see the other guy.
[ door closes ]

00:50.418 --> 00:52.584
That's not a boast
you should make to the guy

00:52.586 --> 00:54.720
Paying
for your insurance.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.722
She bumped a parked car.
But don't worry.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.224
I did the right thing,
and I left a note.
<i>I</i> left a note.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.793
Why are <i>you</i>
<i>leaving the note?</i>
<i>Hey, what's the deal</i>

01:00.795 --> 01:02.294
With the yekekians and their
christmas lights, though?

01:02.296 --> 01:03.562
[ chuckling ]
am I right?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.197
Yeah, I was telling her,
honey,

01:05.199 --> 01:07.399
Owning up to your mistakes
is its own reward.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.068
It's called integrity.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.903
It's something obama doesn't
have with that benghazi thing.
Okay.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.304
But still --
you know -- you know what?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.006
When are the yekekians
gonna take those stupid

01:14.008 --> 01:15.574
Christmas lights down?
I don't know.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.243
Why is Eve
writing notes for her?

01:18.245 --> 01:21.313
Uh, Mandy wouldn't do it.
I'm so disappointed in her.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.149
Well, at least the good one
knows right from wrong.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.752
Oh. All our girls
are equally good.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.087
Oh, yeah.
Keep beating that drum.

[ doorbell rings ]

01:29.757 --> 01:31.323
[ sighs ]

01:31.325 --> 01:32.524
Baxter.
Hey.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.093
Hey,
what are you bringing

01:34.095 --> 01:36.028
This mangy critter
over here for?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.030
Lady's a purebred
german shepherd.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.164
I was talking to lady.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.233
Vanessa:
Oh. Come on.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.235
Seriously, Mike.
Come on in, chuck.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.269
[ sighs ] okay.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.271
Well, we can't stay long
because...

01:46.273 --> 01:48.107
[ sighs ]
...I don't want to.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.743
Listen, I went to
the breeders today,

01:51.745 --> 01:52.878
And a funny thing --

01:52.880 --> 01:55.581
It turns out
lady is already pregnant.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.683
Now, how do you think
that happened, Baxter?

01:57.685 --> 02:01.420
Well, when, uh...When two dogs
really love each other...

02:02.655 --> 02:04.690
...And they have
enough tequila --

02:04.692 --> 02:07.693
[ sighs ] I never leave her
around male dogs.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.195
Then, I remember
when Eve volunteered

02:10.197 --> 02:11.864
To watch lady
for the weekend.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.065
Yeah.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.968
There is one dog
she might have had contact with.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.106
Oh.
[ chuckling ] oh.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.275
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.911
Muffin is less a dog
than a throw pillow.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.779
Oh.

02:27.781 --> 02:31.116
[ chuckling ] and, number two,
muffin is a girl.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.618
Uh, honey, you're --
you're kidding, right?

02:32.620 --> 02:33.785
Muffin's a male.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.024
S-s-since when?

02:39.026 --> 02:40.526
Well --

02:40.528 --> 02:43.428
You never checked your dog's
undercarriage, Baxter?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.797
We don't have
that kind of relationship.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.634
Come here. Come here.
Come here just for a second.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.935
Let me see you.
[ sighs ]

02:49.937 --> 02:51.937
It's mostly fluff
down there.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.640
Kind of like
an early <i>penthouse</i> magazine.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.141
Yeah, well, look close.

02:56.143 --> 02:59.678
They're a lot tinier
on the white ones.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.549
I'll be damned.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.218
Oh.
Well, kind of makes me
a little uncomfortable

03:06.220 --> 03:08.754
With all the naps
we've taken together.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.390
I feel weird
that you feel weird about that.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.760
How is that dog not fixed,
Baxter?

03:14.762 --> 03:17.696
Has sarah mclachlan
taught you people nothing?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.465
Wait -- the -- hold --
let's get this straight.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.833
You brought
a dog in heat

03:21.835 --> 03:23.835
Into a home
with a well-known player.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.204
Give me five.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.340
I only allow
lady to breed

03:28.342 --> 03:30.776
With other purebred
german shepherds.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.345
Well, maybe you should teach
lady how to say, "nein!"

03:33.347 --> 03:38.150
I get like $500 or $600 apiece
for lady's pups.

03:38.152 --> 03:41.286
Sweet.
What's our cut of that?

03:41.288 --> 03:44.790
Nobody is gonna want
whatever weird monster babies

03:44.792 --> 03:46.792
Come out of her now!

03:46.794 --> 03:51.463
Half german shepherd,
half...Dust bunny!

03:51.465 --> 03:53.665
W-what are you planning
on doing about this, Baxter?

03:53.667 --> 03:54.866
Are you
absolutely sure

03:54.868 --> 03:56.501
She hasn't been
with any other dogs?

03:56.503 --> 04:00.172
What are you
suggesting?

04:00.174 --> 04:02.774
That lady...Is a tramp.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.179
Walk around the neighborhood
in a fur coat with no pants --

04:07.181 --> 04:08.880
What did you expect
was gonna happen?

04:08.882 --> 04:12.517
What do you want, Baxter,
a paternity test?

04:12.519 --> 04:13.819
That's a good idea.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.954
Maybe later on,
muffin and I stop by your house

04:15.956 --> 04:18.090
And drop a dna sample
on your front lawn.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.762
-- Captions by vitac --

04:26.599 --> 04:28.000
I'm just
having trouble

04:28.002 --> 04:30.769
Picturing how this was possible
between muffin and lady.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.605
Well, muffin's a resourceful
little guy, you know?

04:33.607 --> 04:36.041
Maybe he got up
on the picnic table.

04:36.043 --> 04:39.044
Which I will no longer
be eating off of.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.481
And maybe they, uh,
did it "people style."

04:42.483 --> 04:44.483
You know what, honey?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.318
We got to make this right
with the larabees.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.520
Carol is my closest friend
in the neighborhood.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.290
This is on lady
for not being careful.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.624
Because, when it comes
to birth control,

04:52.626 --> 04:54.760
The female bears
total responsibility.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.428
Well, if she doesn't want to
bear puppies, she does.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.765
Oh, my god.
Bear puppies are so cute.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.999
[ laughs ]

05:01.001 --> 05:03.168
Muffin is gonna make such
a great dad. Aren't you?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.836
"hey! You kids
knock it off back there,

05:04.838 --> 05:07.005
"or I'm gonna
turn this car right around!

05:07.007 --> 05:08.173
Stop!"

05:08.175 --> 05:11.043
Uh, so, what's gonna happen
with the puppies?

05:11.045 --> 05:12.377
Uh, what puppies?

05:12.379 --> 05:15.814
Oh, uh, muffin knocked up
the larabees' german shepherd.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.583
[ sighs ]
and, look,
didn't skip town.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.553
Boyd, it's time for dinner,
sweetie.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.856
So, muffin impregnated a dog
four times his size?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.592
Tom cruise
knocked up katie holmes.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.530
Anything is possible.
[ chuckles ]

05:31.532 --> 05:33.265
I didn't even know
muffin was a male.

05:33.267 --> 05:37.069
See? He fools everybody
with that squat-and-pee thing.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.403
Well...
First thing's first --

05:38.405 --> 05:40.172
We really
should get him neutered.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.007
Take his nuts off?
Oh, honey.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.676
After what those
little nuggets accomplished?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.346
Hey. Nobody answered me. What's
gonna happen with the puppies?

05:47.348 --> 05:49.581
Well [sighs] the larabees
will probably try

05:49.583 --> 05:50.882
To find them good homes.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.084
Which will be tricky

05:52.086 --> 05:54.086
'cause nobody really wants
a maltese shepherd.

05:54.088 --> 05:55.087
A germ-tese.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.922
Mal-- mall-turd?
[ chuckles ]

05:56.924 --> 05:58.924
Okay, so,
if they can't find homes...

05:58.926 --> 06:00.525
Well, if they can't
find homes,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.227
Then they'll end up
at the pound,

06:02.229 --> 06:03.929
And they'll probably
be just destr--

06:03.931 --> 06:05.931
H-hey. Hi. Hey.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.099
Uh, did, uh --

06:07.101 --> 06:08.300
Maybe you should
wash your hands, honey.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.835
Yeah.
I already washed them.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.136
Did those fingers end up
in your nose since then?

06:11.138 --> 06:14.139
Only these two.
Aah.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.341
Go, go, go.
Wash them again. Let's go.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.342
[ sighs ]

06:17.344 --> 06:18.510
There's
very little chance

06:18.512 --> 06:20.145
Those puppies
will end up in the pound.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.246
Oh. That's a relief.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.348
He's just gonna terminate
the pregnancy.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.050
Oh, dad, what?
Oh, Mike. Come on.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.551
Well, that's what happens --
they'll get rid of the babies

06:26.553 --> 06:28.220
So she can go through
another breeding cycle.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.354
That's just what happens,
guys.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.622
Well, we can't
let him do that.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.057
Dad,
we have to save them.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.726
Don't we have any rights?
Muffin is the father.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.895
Wait a minute, are you saying
someone other than the mother

06:36.897 --> 06:39.131
Has rights
during the pregnancy?

06:39.133 --> 06:42.901
"one of my puppies
could grow up to cure cancer!"

06:42.903 --> 06:44.035
I am just saying

06:44.037 --> 06:46.371
That you and chuck
should work something out.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.572
No, no. No, no.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.142
This is a choice
between lady and her physician.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.544
Maybe she's not ready
to have children.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.945
Maybe this is
an inconvenient time.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.847
Maybe she wants to go back
to obedience school, you know?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.582
Whatever.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.651
The father has no rights
when it comes to pregnancy.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.254
Yeah, but he has plenty to say
before the pregnancy.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.089
By using birth control
or self-control --

07:04.091 --> 07:06.958
Two things
guys kind of stink at.
Amen.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.493
It sounds like
someone's trying

07:08.495 --> 07:10.562
To ditch out on
their responsibilities, Mike.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.898
I didn't
get the dog pregnant.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.101
I didn't even know muffin
had the equipment.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.103
All right. Let's pray.
We eat.

put the phones down.

[ inhale sharply ]
oh, no. It's an unknown number.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.676
Oh, I bet
it's that car you bumped.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.145
Mandy, answer it.
You can't run away from it.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.815
Hi.
This is Mandy Baxter.

07:29.817 --> 07:30.949
Hey, hey, hey.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.118
See if he wants
a monster puppy as payment.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.853
Stop.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.463
[ doorbell rings ]

07:48.100 --> 07:50.168
Oh. Hey, carol.
Is chuck around?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.003
Sorry, Mike.
He's not here.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.839
Oh, okay, would you tell him
that Vanessa and I

07:53.841 --> 07:58.443
Figured it probably was muffin
that got his freak on with lady?

07:58.445 --> 08:00.111
Oh, well,
lady is a big girl,

08:00.113 --> 08:02.681
And by that I mean
she probably didn't notice.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.851
Um, well,
w-whatever the costs,

08:05.853 --> 08:07.552
W-we'll
share them with you.
Okay.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.222
'cause it's -- you know, it's --
it's the right thing to do.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.257
Fine.
You're welcome.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.425
I didn't
say "thank you."

08:13.427 --> 08:17.429
I know you didn't,
but...You're welcome.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.563
Listen.
[ chuckles ]

08:18.565 --> 08:20.065
I'll tell chuck.
I promise.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.434
But I'm not quite sure
when I'm gonna see him again.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.935
Ah, don't worry.
I'm sure he'll come back.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.237
Don't let
the statistics scare you.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.505
[ chuckles ]

08:27.874 --> 08:32.077
That's -- that's a kind
of joke chuck enjoys.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.746
Mm.
He really doesn't.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.148
But he's not here.
He moved out.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.950
Out?

08:38.952 --> 08:40.986
Out --
almost a week ago.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.787
I'm sorry to hear that.
I really am.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.155
So, um,
if you don't mind me asking,

08:44.157 --> 08:45.490
Where --
where did he move to?

08:45.492 --> 08:47.492
He's staying temporarily
over at the pinewood,

08:47.494 --> 08:49.728
Those furnished apartments
you can rent by the week.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.729
Ri-- [ laughs ]

08:50.731 --> 08:52.063
It's funny
'cause a lot of guys

08:52.065 --> 08:55.100
Rent those by the by the hour
'cause the --

08:55.102 --> 08:58.270
I don't -- I'm s-- I don't --
I don't -- I don't --

08:58.272 --> 09:00.238
I don't think chuck
did it that way, though.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.516
Hey.
Hi.

09:11.518 --> 09:14.085
So...How pissed
was the guy about his car.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.720
Did he yell?
Did he slap you?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.022
You know what?

09:17.024 --> 09:19.791
He was actually really impressed
that I left a note.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.560
But   left the note.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.595
Yeah, it turns out that he owns
that electronics store

09:23.597 --> 09:24.930
Where we parked,

09:24.932 --> 09:28.600
And he said that my honesty
restored his faith in humanity.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.636
And then he gathered
all of his employees around.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.139
And...They slapped you?

09:34.141 --> 09:35.507
They applauded me.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.808
And then...

09:36.810 --> 09:38.276
He gave me an ipad!

09:38.278 --> 09:40.912
What?
Yeah!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.747
Yeah, he said I should be
rewarded for my integrity.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.850
Mm-hmm.
But it's <i>my</i> integrity,
so it's <i>my</i> ipad.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.719
Ooh, Eve, Eve, Eve.
No.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.787
Just try
being a better person.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.155
Good things
will happen to you, too.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.024
[ sighs ]

09:53.026 --> 09:54.225
Hey, honey?
Yeah?

09:54.227 --> 09:55.961
Good night, girls.
Good night.
Both: Good night.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.796
You ready for bed?
As a matter of fact, I am.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.664
But you know what? I'm gonna
get some cereal. I'll be up.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.800
Okay.
Oh, hey. You know what?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.768
You never told me
how things went with chuck.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.337
Are you two, uh,
all back to normal?

10:05.339 --> 10:06.438
In that we still
dislike each other?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.973
That's never
gonna change.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.107
He actually
wasn't there.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.809
But, uh, carol gave me
his new address.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.277
New address?
What new address?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.145
Are the larabees
moving?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.547
Just chuck.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.082
What?

10:17.084 --> 10:19.618
Hey, are you telling me
that chuck left carol?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.186
I don't know.
We -- we didn't get into it.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.255
[ gasps ] I --
[ sighs ] I'm shocked.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.457
You know,
I'm not really shocked.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.491
I think
she woke up one day

10:26.493 --> 10:29.995
And went,
"damn, I'm married to chuck?"

10:29.997 --> 10:32.864
Either way, honey, this is
none of our business, okay?

10:32.866 --> 10:35.333
No. No. I just -- I can't
believe she didn't tell me.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.669
I-I just saw her yesterday,
and she never let on.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.905
I guess it's true --
black don't crack.

10:42.408 --> 10:45.610
That's not
what that means.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.911
I asked her
if she was okay,

10:46.913 --> 10:48.613
And she had the nerve
to say "fine."

10:48.615 --> 10:49.914
But she is fine.
No, she lied
right to my face.

10:49.916 --> 10:50.915
No, she is fine.
No.

10:50.917 --> 10:51.983
She said "fine" to me,
too.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.485
You know that feeling
that washes over you

10:53.487 --> 10:54.886
Every time
chuck leaves the room?

10:56.589 --> 10:57.822
Where are you going?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.624
I'm going to see my dear friend
carol larabee.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.859
You know
what time it is?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.128
No, I just
want to make sure she's okay

11:03.130 --> 11:05.730
And that she knows
that I am always there for her.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.233
Don't go over there now!
There's no reason to --

11:08.235 --> 11:09.901
See if she's got milk.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.538
And, hey,
watch your step.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.674
I made good
on that dna promise, too.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.076
[ sighs ]

11:20.613 --> 11:23.114
[ doorbell rings ]

11:25.885 --> 11:27.018
Vanessa?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.520
Oh, carol, honey,
Mike told me about chuck.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.355
You --
you must be devastated.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.723
You know, I'm actually
a very private person

11:31.725 --> 11:33.058
When it comes
to things like this.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.526
Right. Mm-hmm.
I'm hoping
you'll understand that.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.361
But we're friends.
I didn't think you would.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.463
Come on in.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.864
I know, sweetie.
I-I-I hate to intrude.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.200
But how --
how are you holding up?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.868
This is probably
the worst of it right here.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.969
Yeah.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.204
Yeah, listen, carol,

11:46.206 --> 11:47.472
You don't have to pretend
to be strong for me.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.474
If there's one thing
I've learned as a military wife,

11:49.476 --> 11:51.342
It's how to get along
without my husband.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.944
Mm. Yeah.
And, with all that
moving around,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.345
Not to get too close
to the neighbors.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.346
So...

11:55.348 --> 11:57.982
Well, wait, listen.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.552
Carol, I mean,
w-when did chuck leave home?

12:00.554 --> 12:02.587
A week ago.
What?

12:02.589 --> 12:04.889
A-a week ago? But --
but I just saw you yesterday.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.292
We went to a movie. Why --
why didn't you tell me then?

12:07.294 --> 12:08.727
I don't talk
in movie theaters.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.794
I --
most of us don't.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.296
I know, but --
tell your friends.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.363
[ sighs ]

12:12.365 --> 12:13.498
Although,
I did agree with that woman

Who yelled,
"watch out, gravity!

12:15.001 --> 12:18.303
Don't let go
of that spaceship!"

12:18.305 --> 12:19.471
I'm sorry.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.673
I thought we were --
were closer than that.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.475
Well, if you had asked me about
chuck, I would have told you.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.876
Well -- "asked you?"

12:24.878 --> 12:26.711
Well, carol, I-I-I can't ask you
about every little thing.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.513
I mean, I-I can't
ask you every time I see you

12:28.515 --> 12:30.014
If you have
some terrible disease.

would you stop yelling at me?

Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.758
I'm sorry, too. Aw.

I mean, I didn't know
chuck and me having a big fight

12:41.795 --> 12:43.962
Would cause you
this much pain.
No, it's just -- no.

you dented my car again.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.229
[ laughs ]

13:18.231 --> 13:19.631
But, of course,
you <i>would</i> tell me

13:19.633 --> 13:21.132
Because you're
such an honest person.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.301
Aww. Yeah, no.
I was really careful this time.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.303
I just parked
in the handicapped spot.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.305
Okay.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.307
So, are you enjoying
your ipad?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.375
[ inhales sharply ]

13:30.377 --> 13:33.244
Well...I kind of thought
that it'd have, like,

13:33.246 --> 13:35.346
More gigs and maybe
the retina display,

13:35.348 --> 13:38.149
So I was hoping that I could
just return it for cash.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.485
Let me get this straight.
Yeah.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.820
You dent my car.
Mm-hmm.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.288
And I reward you
for your honesty

13:43.290 --> 13:44.656
By giving you
a beautiful gift.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.758
Yes,
it was beautiful --

13:46.760 --> 13:49.828
But also sort of,
like, the base model.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.596
And now
you want to return it to me

13:51.598 --> 13:53.298
And expect me
to give you cash?

13:53.300 --> 13:55.400
Mm-hmm. That would be great.
Thank you.

Okay, um...Store credit
is totally fine.

I didn't even leave that note.

to my dad.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.808
Well, ha.

you're being towed right now.

no-hassle return policy.

right now.

it's come to this, muffin.

to kiss them goodbye.

off my mind.

Today, at starbucks,
I ordered a muffin without nuts.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.407
Honey, he'll sleep,
and when he wakes up,

15:09.409 --> 15:10.942
He won't even know
what happened.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.911
He's a guy.
He'll know what happened.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.246
If it happened to me,
I'd know what happened.

you'd have to figure out

while you watch tv.

Listen.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.555
Can we please
talk about the larabees?
This is none of our business.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.990
I tried to get carol
to open up about it, but --

15:25.992 --> 15:27.759
Because it's none
of our business.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.928
Chuck's retirement
is the problem.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.263
See, he's around all the time
with nothing to do,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.165
And he pretends
it doesn't affect him,

15:34.167 --> 15:36.401
But the guy feels like
he's lost his purpose.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.802
You said you couldn't
get her to open up.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.971
Well --
I don't know
this much about jesus,

15:39.973 --> 15:41.472
And I read
the whole book.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.175
Well...I had to fill in
a lot of the blanks.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.777
Look, I know carol
well enough to know

15:45.779 --> 15:47.378
That her pushing me away,
it's really --

15:47.380 --> 15:48.613
Really a plea for help.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.649
Or a plea
for you to go away!

15:51.651 --> 15:52.984
Well, you'll talk to him,

15:52.986 --> 15:54.886
And you'll get
chuck's side of the story.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.020
I don't want
chuck's side of the story!

15:56.022 --> 15:57.121
Why am I involved
in this?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.122
Look, the guy is lost.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.457
He's over there
breeding dogs

15:59.459 --> 16:02.293
Because carol talked him out
of getting chickens.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.494
Listen,
you know the won--

16:03.496 --> 16:04.829
Wonderful thing
about other people's problems?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.531
They're other people's
problems.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.732
Well, you know what?

16:07.734 --> 16:08.967
Do what you want,
but the guy deserves our help.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.302
He's a neighbor, he's a friend,
and he's a vet.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.971
Well, he's not the
kind of vet that could
help me out with muffin.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.072
I'll tell you that.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.109
Oh, come on.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.944
You're gonna have to
figure out something else to do

16:19.946 --> 16:21.679
When you watch tv.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.619
Okay, lady.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.955
Now,
I ran out of brown,

16:30.957 --> 16:35.059
So I'm gonna have to
paint your eyes green!

16:35.061 --> 16:36.327
[ knock on door ]

16:36.329 --> 16:39.330
Okay, well, you just stay there.
I'll get it.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.334
If it's an intruder,
<i>I'll</i> bite him.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.502
[ sighs ]

16:44.504 --> 16:46.337
Come here.
Bax-- Baxter?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.672
Hold on a second.
Come here!

16:47.674 --> 16:51.009
Come here, you little horn dog!
That's cat, damn it.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.177
Oh.
Geez.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.079
Did you bring him around here
to gloat?

16:55.081 --> 16:56.748
No, no.
On my way to get him fixed.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.549
I figured,
maybe for old time's sakes,

16:58.551 --> 17:00.018
That lady
would toss him one.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.054
[ groans ]
we're not interested.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.389
[ door closes ]
[ lady whines ]

17:04.391 --> 17:06.257
I said
we're not interested.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.658
Actually,
the reason I stopped by --

17:07.660 --> 17:09.193
I don't know
what carol told you,

17:09.195 --> 17:11.362
But I'm willing to
take responsibility
for those puppies.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.031
Oh.

17:13.033 --> 17:18.369
I haven't spoken to carol,
but, uh...But thanks.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.706
And, uh...Oh, when you --
when you spoke to carol,

17:21.708 --> 17:25.977
Did, uh -- did she, uh --
did she seem okay?

17:25.979 --> 17:27.712
Yeah, I guess.
I didn't talk to her much.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.547
I talked to her boyfriend.
Man, he can cook.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.050
I don't know
what he was making.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.251
Painting the den there.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.586
Putting his furniture in it.
[ laughs ] oh, Baxter.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.255
I'd really hoped carol

17:37.257 --> 17:40.758
Would get custody of you
in the breakup.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.429
You know, I --
enh-enh!

17:44.431 --> 17:47.732
Oh, that --
man, that's something, huh?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.067
[ sighs ]

17:49.069 --> 17:50.902
Which one of you
painted this?

17:50.904 --> 17:53.237
It's --
it's a new hobby.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.239
I'm not -- not really good
at hobbies. [ sighs ]

17:55.241 --> 17:57.141
Not really good
at painting, either.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.245
Chuck...
What are you doing here?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.148
I'm trying
to enjoy my retirement.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.317
But my wife thinks
I need to be doing stuff.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.019
I-I don't want to --
I don't want to

18:08.021 --> 18:10.588
Clean rain gutters or --
or build shelves

18:10.590 --> 18:12.924
Or plant her
a little patch of oregano.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.326
I do not like oregano!

18:15.328 --> 18:16.794
If you garden
like you paint,

18:16.796 --> 18:18.529
You won't
have to worry about that.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.933
The woman won't accept
that I just like to do nothing.

18:21.935 --> 18:22.934
It's understandable.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.435
I mean,
you are in your late 40s.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.771
That's generally the time
that men just sit back

18:26.773 --> 18:28.439
And wait to die.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.609
Sometimes, death can just
spring up on a man,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.178
Like when
he's bothering a marine.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.547
Listen, I get it.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.049
I get what it's like
coming home.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.151
I was on the road
for eight years of my marriage

18:40.153 --> 18:41.786
Shooting pictures
for outdoor man.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.621
Well, unless those pictures
were shooting back,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.690
It's not really
the same thing.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.291
I'm talking about
when I got him,

18:47.293 --> 18:50.294
My wife had all sorts of ideas
how <i>I</i> should spend <i>my</i> time.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.496
[ sighs ]

18:51.498 --> 18:53.831
Didn't like it, but, I mean,
I didn't just bail out.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.067
[ sighs ] what do you
want me to say, Baxter?

18:56.069 --> 18:58.202
That all I've ever done
is serve my country,

18:58.204 --> 18:59.804
And without it I'm lost?

18:59.806 --> 19:02.173
That my whole identity
was tied up with being a marine,

19:02.175 --> 19:03.841
And now I don't know
who I am?

19:03.843 --> 19:06.344
Or -- or -- or --
oh, I-I'm afraid.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.678
Oh, yeah, now, that's it.
That's it.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.014
I'm afraid to take
the next step in my life

19:10.016 --> 19:13.484
Because what if
I try something new and I fail?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.386
Uh...Exhibit "a."

19:16.421 --> 19:19.123
I ran out of brown!

19:19.125 --> 19:20.625
Look, I-I got home,

19:20.627 --> 19:22.426
And I had to figure out a way
to reinvent myself.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.162
You got to
reinvent yourself.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.297
[ sighs ]
I get it, Baxter.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.665
No, but you can't
do it alone.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.433
You got to
reinvent yourself around the --

19:29.435 --> 19:31.435
The new platoon
you got to spend time with.

19:31.437 --> 19:34.438
It's your wife and kid.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.873
You got to go home,
man.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.010
[ sighs ]

19:39.012 --> 19:40.912
You're welcome.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.948
I didn't
say "thank you."

19:43.950 --> 19:46.817
It's time
to go get snipped.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.220
I'm gonna put them
on a key chain.

19:50.222 --> 19:53.391
You could have just said
you missed me, Baxter.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.391
Yeah, I could have.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.862
Listen, you might want to
give carol a courtesy call

19:57.864 --> 19:59.697
In case someone's there
planting her oregano.

Announcing our first annual
marriage-saver sale.

20% off everything

20:19.052 --> 20:22.753
We sell designed to help you
spend time away from home...

20:22.755 --> 20:26.090
Which is pretty much everything
we sell here at outdoor man.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.092
Because nothing
is better for a marriage

20:28.094 --> 20:31.596
Than not being around each other
all the time.

20:31.598 --> 20:35.099
Ask a man why he goes to work.
He'll say, "to earn a living."

20:35.101 --> 20:37.435
But come on --
with the internet, these days,

20:37.437 --> 20:40.938
Most jobs could be done at home
right next to the little lady.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.206
[ chuckles ]

20:42.208 --> 20:44.875
"what are you working on?
Want to get some lunch?

"since you're here,

"can you fix that thing
that isn't really broken

20:47.814 --> 20:50.181
That I just don't know
how to use?"

20:50.183 --> 20:53.484
Listen, we all know the guy
who worked for 50 years,

20:53.486 --> 20:56.320
Retired, came home,
and died a few weeks later.

20:56.322 --> 21:00.191
And people say,
"he worked himself to death."

21:00.193 --> 21:01.592
I don't know.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.429
He was fine when he was working.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.332
Sounds like the dude came home,
and that killed him.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.500
Come on.

21:09.502 --> 21:12.703
The only way to be missed
is to be gone sometimes.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.206
We've got explorer-model
backpacks on sale now

21:15.208 --> 21:17.708
From 25% to 35% off.

21:17.710 --> 21:21.345
Be sure to be gone long enough
that she starts to actually say,

21:21.347 --> 21:25.716
"you know,
he doesn't smell that bad."

21:25.718 --> 21:28.519
So, pick up one of these
and take a hike

21:28.521 --> 21:31.255
Before the wife tells you to.
