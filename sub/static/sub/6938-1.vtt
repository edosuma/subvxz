WEBVTT

00:08.276 --> 00:09.543
* You got the tree up

00:09.577 --> 00:11.245
* A star on the tip-top

00:11.279 --> 00:14.648
* With tinsel
and twinkling lights *

00:14.682 --> 00:16.216
* We put up the stockings

00:16.250 --> 00:17.551
* The gifts and the garland

00:17.585 --> 00:21.255
* It sure looks like
Christmas inside *

00:21.289 --> 00:27.461
* You know the mistletoe
is right for kissing *

00:27.495 --> 00:29.830
* Oh...

00:29.863 --> 00:34.535
* There's only one thing
that we're missing *

00:34.568 --> 00:35.769
* We're calling for snow

00:35.803 --> 00:38.272
* And we'll take it in a hurry

00:38.306 --> 00:39.373
* Ring the north pole

00:39.407 --> 00:40.808
* And tell the elves to scurry

00:40.841 --> 00:44.212
* Get Santa to blow
a flake or a flurry *

00:44.245 --> 00:48.216
* We're callin' for snow
Ho-ho-ho... *

00:48.249 --> 00:49.250
Hi, Ms. Rogers.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.152
I'm loving your hair cut.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.587
You cut it.
It's much shorter, right?

00:53.621 --> 00:54.822
I love them.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.524
Okay, I'll take a pair
in the size medium.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.758
Thanks.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.461
Oh, Gwen, they're
exactly what I wanted.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.729
Now, if only I had--

01:01.762 --> 01:03.731
A matching scarf?

01:03.764 --> 01:04.697
Amazing.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.202
They're perfect.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.740
Hey, Donna, black boots
in the window, size eight.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.475
I'll be back in a half an hour.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.676
They are gorgeous, and I love
your new haircut, by the way.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.748
That one.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.284
Thanks, David.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.324
Perfect.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.761
Okay, I'm going to take
a size six in the pink,

01:33.794 --> 01:35.829
a ten in the red, and...

01:35.863 --> 01:38.266
Tiffany, this one's for me.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.500
I shouldn't, right?
I shouldn't.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.534
Actually, you know what,
I'm gonna do it.

01:40.568 --> 01:41.702
'Cause you only live once,
right?

01:41.735 --> 01:42.870
I'm gonna get it.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.241
Thank you, Nancy.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.609
Merry Christmas.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.779
* We're callin' for snow
Ho-ho-ho... *

01:51.812 --> 01:54.248
Great jacket.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.319
Have a good one.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.420
Gift Wrapped

01:59.453 --> 02:00.354
for all your personal
shopping needs,

02:00.388 --> 02:01.222
how can I help you?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.323
Diane wants to see you.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.324
Right now?

02:03.357 --> 02:05.293
- Yes.
- Thanks.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.694
Of course
we shop for toys.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.661
Let me
put you through.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.330
Hey, guys.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.663
Dine, I heard
you wanted to talk to me.

02:10.698 --> 02:11.432
Oh, Gwen, good, you're here.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.302
Wow, Anna, you are
about to pop.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.771
And I feel that way, thank you.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.772
Well, don't pop yet.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.740
We've still got four weeks

02:19.773 --> 02:20.741
until Christmas.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.876
And on that note,

02:22.910 --> 02:24.478
Gwen, I need you
to go see Charlie Baker

02:24.512 --> 02:25.813
this afternoon.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.815
Anna has a doctor's appointment,

02:27.848 --> 02:29.450
and he needs
someone ASAP.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.784
Yeah, of course.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.186
And he is our best client,
so pay attention.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.621
Got it.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.357
Are you sure you're okay?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.626
It's just
these darn Braxton-Hicks.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.695
Uh, this is
his office address.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.297
His assistant's made
an appointment for you at 3:00.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.166
Today 3:00?
3:00 today?

02:47.568 --> 02:50.371
Because this is, um, downtown,
and that's in 30 minutes.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.639
I know.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.906
So don't be late.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.310
Okay, yeah. Got it.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.278
All right, feel better.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.246
Thank you.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:09.723 --> 03:10.924
Come on, Daisy.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.297
Come on, Daisy,
come on, Daisy...

03:17.931 --> 03:19.700
Whoo! Good girl.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.625
Merry Christmas.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.737
Hi.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.847
Hi.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.848
Hi. Can I help you?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.583
Yes, you can, Pat.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.552
I'm Gwen, I'm Charlie Baker's
personal shopper.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.553
Well, no, sorry,

04:12.586 --> 04:13.821
I shouldn't have said that.

04:13.854 --> 04:14.722
I'm not his, like,
official personal shopper.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.324
His official
personal shopper is Anna,

04:16.357 --> 04:17.690
who is at
a doctor's appointment,

04:17.725 --> 04:20.060
because she's having
this Braxton-Hicks thing--

04:20.093 --> 04:21.595
Have you had kids?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.497
So, anyway, I'm here
for her for today.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.433
Oh, well, Charlie's just
wrapping up a conference call.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.501
So, have a seat,

04:27.535 --> 04:28.502
and I'll let you know
when he's ready to see you.

04:28.536 --> 04:29.537
Great, thank you, Pat.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.671
Whoa,

04:30.704 --> 04:31.839
you're a big
coffee fan, huh?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.541
Not really.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.510
Charlie just likes to give me
mugs for every occasion.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.418
I love your nude pumps.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.786
Uh, excuse me? Gwen?

04:45.819 --> 04:46.954
Yeah.

04:46.987 --> 04:47.921
Charlie will see you now.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.890
Oh, thanks.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.559
It's just
up the stairs,

04:51.592 --> 04:52.526
first door on your right.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.627
Great. Thanks.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.829
You okay?

04:55.863 --> 04:57.465
No, yeah, it's just this chair.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.499
It wreaks havoc

04:58.532 --> 04:59.533
with my back.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.469
Well, feel better, Pat.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.703
Yes, well, I'll get
those figures to you

05:02.736 --> 05:04.104
by the end of the day.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.606
Yeah.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.375
Well, just don't go talking
to anybody else.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.646
Yeah, well,
I'll make it happen.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.581
Bye for now.

05:14.915 --> 05:15.816
Positive direction.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.519
Excuse me?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.120
No, I was just...

05:20.153 --> 05:21.121
I was overhearing you,

05:21.154 --> 05:23.023
and you were,
like, sort of

05:23.056 --> 05:24.592
setting the wheels in motion
for a positive outcome,

05:24.625 --> 05:25.759
you know.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.796
And you are..?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.564
Sorry, I should
have said that first.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.766
I'm Gwen Burke.
I'm filling in for Anna.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.435
Of course.
Have a seat.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.769
Great.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.508
Nice office.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.577
Did Anna give you a list?

05:43.611 --> 05:44.912
She didn't
give me a list.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.480
I... can text her.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.981
That's fine.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.750
The most important thing
I need right now is a new suit.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.118
I've got a couple of functions
I need to attend to,

05:51.151 --> 05:52.620
one of them being
a Christmas party.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.488
Fun.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.457
Okay, new suit for
the Christmas party.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.058
What are you thinking
for a tie?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.927
I'll just wear this one.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.566
You're serious?

06:05.599 --> 06:06.767
That one?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.669
That's a very out-of-date tie.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.904
I'm not sure who even
guided you to wear that today.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.039
If it's Anna, please don't
tell her I said that,

06:12.072 --> 06:15.008
but you really can't wear that
to a Christmas party,

06:15.042 --> 06:16.910
because it's not going with
the structure of your suit.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.912
Is that most of your collection?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.649
I don't really have
a collection.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.586
We're starting from scratch, and
I love that.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.956
This is not
my first rodeo.

06:28.989 --> 06:29.990
I had a client
last week,

06:30.023 --> 06:31.592
we overhauled
his whole closet.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.626
Pop that up, there we go.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.127
What are you doing?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.096
I'm taking
your measurements.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.766
My tailor already has them.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.440
Yeah. Gotcha.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.110
Just make sure
it's either grey or black.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.045
All right? Nothing fancy.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.080
Really?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.915
Because it's
a Christmas party.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.917
You're gonna go walking in
like a dark cloud, and I just--

06:56.950 --> 06:58.118
Do you mind?

06:58.151 --> 06:59.653
Whoa. Yeah.

06:59.687 --> 07:00.788
Thank you.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.759
Karl, just
hang on a sec.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.027
Also,
one more thing,

07:07.060 --> 07:09.697
I need a Christmas gift
for my son's teacher.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.632
Can you tell me
anything about her?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.501
Uh, is she scholarly?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.868
Does she like sports?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.136
How would I know?
Just get her a mug or something.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.771
I mean, Pat will
give you the details.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.872
A mug?

07:18.906 --> 07:19.840
I can't sleep
with myself at night

07:19.873 --> 07:21.642
if I do that.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.976
Do you think that
your wife could maybe--

07:23.010 --> 07:24.144
She's deceased.

07:27.848 --> 07:28.782
I'm so sorry...

07:28.816 --> 07:30.050
Hey.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.752
That's exactly why
we're on the phone.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.521
I don't want to low-ball
this thing too hard

07:33.554 --> 07:35.556
and lose it.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.690
Three minutes ago--

07:36.724 --> 07:37.658
Should I...?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.059
Yes.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.861
I realize that.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.062
I realize
that, but--

07:42.095 --> 07:43.096
I'm gonna...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.732
I don't... think...

07:44.765 --> 07:45.833
...head out.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.070
Well, that's why
that email...

07:50.103 --> 07:51.905
That's why people
invented email.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.107
Yeah, and I normally
would be, like,

07:54.141 --> 07:55.609
"No, thank you."

07:55.643 --> 07:56.744
But he's one of
Gift Wrapped's biggest clients,

07:56.777 --> 07:57.845
and if I do a good job,

07:57.878 --> 07:59.079
Diane will probably
assign him to me

07:59.112 --> 08:00.147
when Anna's
on maternity leave.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.115
Don't you have enough clients?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.951
I mean, you're already working
seven days a week.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.553
I love working, I love my job.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.654
What are you talking about?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.188
Well, your
love life doesn't.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.590
Really?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.158
Are you really
going to do that?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.093
You're going to give me
a sisterly lecture right now

08:13.126 --> 08:14.795
about how I'm going to
end up old and alone?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.130
Well, you will if you don't
dedicate some time to yourself.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.298
For dating?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.768
Do you know
how rough it is out there?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.202
Gwen, after dad died,

08:22.235 --> 08:23.303
you made it your mission
to make sure that mom was happy,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.072
and you're doing the same thing
with your clients.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.073
I mean, what about you?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.609
Thank you.
Thank you for that.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.677
You're so sweet.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.878
Have you heard from mom?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.312
No.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.714
I think she's still on
the Mediterranean cruise.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.649
And don't
change the subject.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.717
I'm just saying
that you need a little balance.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.919
Thank you, Steph.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.187
I really
appreciate--

08:41.922 --> 08:43.657
Are you talking
about my diet?

08:43.691 --> 08:46.059
Because if I eat
one more salad,

08:46.093 --> 08:47.861
I swear I'm going to
grow roots

08:47.895 --> 08:49.129
right into
the ground.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.864
What's wrong with salad?

08:50.898 --> 08:51.999
No, uh, nothing,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.634
if you're a rabbit.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.668
Do I look like
a rabbit?

08:54.702 --> 08:55.769
Do I? Gwen?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.170
Honestly?
You do.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.639
Yeah, I can...
I can see it.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.141
My friend Sue
shaved these two teeth down

09:01.174 --> 09:02.876
with a nail file, so...

09:02.910 --> 09:04.144
you could probably just do that.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.012
Anyway, I'll let you guys
figure that one out.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.682
But you'll both be
very happy to know

09:08.716 --> 09:09.917
that the condo
I've been eying

09:09.950 --> 09:11.619
is going down in price,

09:11.652 --> 09:13.854
so I might be out of your hair
sooner rather than later.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.888
Yay.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.189
Bye, wabbit!

09:16.223 --> 09:18.826
Go have some fun
bunny time!

09:21.361 --> 09:22.362
Now I feel
self-conscious.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.765
All right.

09:24.798 --> 09:28.869
Miss Henderson,
what are you all about?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.971
Um...

09:31.004 --> 09:32.072
Hmm.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.073
There you are.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.174
That was easy.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.743
Okay, third trade teacher,

09:35.776 --> 09:37.177
been at the school six years,

09:37.210 --> 09:39.212
girls' volleyball coach.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.781
Cute picture.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.318
Head of the school library
book drive.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.353
Boom.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
Dad, do you think next weekend

09:55.996 --> 09:58.365
we can get
our own Christmas tree?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.767
Of course.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.868
I'll just call
my assistant,

10:00.901 --> 10:02.269
and I'll have one
ordered to the house.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.237
No, I mean, we can go and get
our own Christmas tree

10:04.271 --> 10:06.974
at the cabin
like we used to.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.712
I don't know, Owen.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.813
I'm really swamped right now,
but I'll tell you what,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.215
I'm gonna make sure
Pat orders a really good one.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.383
Okay?

10:16.416 --> 10:17.951
An eight-footer,
straight to the ceiling.

10:17.985 --> 10:18.952
Okay?

10:18.986 --> 10:19.920
Mr. Baker!

10:21.054 --> 10:22.055
Oh, Mr. Baker...

10:23.156 --> 10:24.658
Thank you!

10:24.692 --> 10:25.759
Your Christmas present
was not only thoughtful,

10:25.793 --> 10:26.927
but so generous.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.197
It...

10:30.230 --> 10:32.265
It was?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.300
Of course.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.668
I mean, thanks to you,

10:34.702 --> 10:36.403
we now no longer have
empty shelves

10:36.436 --> 10:37.905
in our school library.

10:38.906 --> 10:39.907
Great, that's...

10:39.940 --> 10:41.174
So you liked the...

10:41.208 --> 10:42.810
the books.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.411
Liked?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.079
I loved them,

10:46.113 --> 10:47.280
and so will the kids.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.019
Great, well,

10:52.052 --> 10:54.822
I'm going to head to work now.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.423
Um...

10:56.456 --> 10:58.025
I'll see you later on tonight,
okay, buddy?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.960
Before bed?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.361
Yeah, I'll-I'll do my best.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.469
Thank you.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.039
Oh, Merry Christmas!

11:16.309 --> 11:17.410
These are kind of boring,
aren't they?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.280
Well, that's what
Mr. Baker usually buys.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.149
Really?

11:22.182 --> 11:25.185
I'm gonna fall asleep.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.353
Sal...

11:27.755 --> 11:28.722
What can you tell me

11:28.756 --> 11:29.757
about that suit?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.093
No, no, no,
he never buys stripes.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.462
Come on, Sal,
we gotta think outside the box

11:35.495 --> 11:36.496
a little bit here.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.931
Don't you think
that purple

11:37.965 --> 11:38.899
would just bring out
the green in his eyes?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.268
It would be like bam.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.870
Well, perhaps,

11:42.903 --> 11:44.437
but, honestly,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.006
he is very particular.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.307
I'll take it.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.042
What?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.011
What do you think?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.980
Don't you get jealous.

11:53.013 --> 11:53.947
Come here.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.082
No, no.

11:55.115 --> 11:55.916
No, no, please, please.
Would you...

11:55.949 --> 11:56.984
They're very
expensive mannequins.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.052
I'll be with you in a moment.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.020
One moment.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.226
Knock, knock.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.461
I have a surprise for you.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.430
I'm so glad
you're sitting.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.132
Brace yourself,
brace yourself.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.104
What do you think?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.772
It's purple.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.941
Pur-- This?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.976
This is not purple,
Charlie Baker.

12:23.010 --> 12:26.780
This is a gorgeous,
yet masculine, navy suit

12:26.814 --> 12:28.281
with a very delicate
purple pinstripe.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.083
I thought I was clear.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.051
Just try it on.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.020
Arms up.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.859
What?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.894
Can I see
your arm for a second?

12:40.928 --> 12:42.896
This is way too tight.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.998
Did you maybe gain
a little weight?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.867
Of course not.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.068
Well, it's okay
if you did.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.369
You shouldn't feel bad.
It's the holidays.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.004
It's just, I used
the exact measurements

12:51.038 --> 12:52.005
that Sal had--

12:52.039 --> 12:53.273
No, it's fine--

12:53.306 --> 12:53.874
--and unless the
measurements are wrong,

12:53.907 --> 12:55.108
then you gained weight.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.043
Well, if you used
the measurements

12:56.076 --> 12:57.845
from the store, it's...

13:01.281 --> 13:02.249
You gained weight.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.250
What's wrong is

13:03.283 --> 13:04.551
the suit is wrong.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.186
If you had just bought
what I asked you to buy,

13:06.219 --> 13:07.554
we wouldn't have this problem.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.889
All right.

13:08.922 --> 13:09.823
Well, I'm sorry
you don't like it,

13:09.857 --> 13:10.991
but it's the holidays,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.292
and if I let you go into
a Christmas party

13:12.325 --> 13:13.426
wearing a black suit,

13:13.460 --> 13:14.594
that's about as bad
as someone's uncle

13:14.627 --> 13:15.395
walking into
a wedding in white.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.897
I'm not gonna
let you do that--

13:16.930 --> 13:17.764
Did you buy books
for Owen's teacher?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.599
I did buy books
for Owen's teacher.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.101
Did she like them?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.370
I tried to get a whole
demographic of books--

13:23.403 --> 13:25.505
Yes, but that's
besides the point.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.907
You know a mug
would have sufficed,

13:26.940 --> 13:28.475
or some flowers.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.178
Should we ask your secretary
if a mug would have sufficed?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.846
I think everyone's
a little mugged out--

13:32.880 --> 13:34.614
Are you always this difficult?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.916
Excuse me?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.084
The term
"personal shopper,"

13:37.117 --> 13:39.987
in my mind,

13:40.020 --> 13:43.123
is describing someone
that makes your life easier,

13:43.156 --> 13:44.457
not complicated--

13:44.491 --> 13:46.026
I don't think
making people happy

13:46.059 --> 13:47.060
is complicated,

13:47.094 --> 13:48.361
and I think
you should know

13:48.395 --> 13:49.963
that all of my clients
love my personal touch.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.465
And my job title is
"personal shopper,"

13:52.499 --> 13:54.267
so I'm sorry
that doesn't work for you.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.070
I would appreciate it
if you just did what I asked

13:57.104 --> 13:58.939
and left
your personal feelings

13:58.972 --> 14:01.208
or your touch,
or whatever it is,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.410
out of it.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.654
Just for the record,

14:14.687 --> 14:15.588
I do think the purple

14:15.622 --> 14:17.157
would bring out
the green in your eyes.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.406
Gwen, I need
to talk to you.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.175
Hi, Diane.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.443
You know, if this is about
Charlie Baker, let's say I'm--

14:36.476 --> 14:37.477
Actually, it is.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.378
--Really glad that he's not--

14:38.411 --> 14:40.047
Really?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.214
Anna's been ordered
on bed rest until her due date.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.916
Oh, man, is she okay?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.517
Oh, she's fine,
it's just a precaution.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.186
But the good news is,

14:46.219 --> 14:47.220
with Anna
out of commission,

14:47.254 --> 14:48.288
it looks like
Charlie Baker

14:48.321 --> 14:51.158
just became your newest client.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.625
Isn't that great?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.063
So great, Diane, so great.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.066
It's so great.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.505
He's just
so self-centered,

15:05.538 --> 15:07.174
and he's arrogant,

15:07.207 --> 15:08.441
and he doesn't even care
what gifts he gives,

15:08.475 --> 15:10.110
at all.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.078
Like, if it were up to him,
it would just be like,

15:11.111 --> 15:12.946
"Oh, here's a coffee mug.
What's your name?"

15:12.980 --> 15:14.347
Like, I have
no tolerance for that.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.116
Then why did you take him on?

15:16.149 --> 15:18.451
Because, Steph, he's one of
Gift Wrapped's biggest clients.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.587
Like, it would look horrible
if I said no.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.259
Hmm, speaking of which,

15:26.293 --> 15:28.395
he needs a dozen
Christmas baskets by tomorrow.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.364
Oh, well, I hope you can
find enough mugs.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.711
Hey, Caitlin,

15:44.744 --> 15:46.313
is Owen still up?

15:46.346 --> 15:47.480
Sorry, Mr. Baker.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.481
He went to bed

15:48.515 --> 15:50.017
about a half hour ago.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.486
Okay, well, thanks.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.754
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.124
Yeah. You have a good night.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.301
That can't be right.

17:35.622 --> 17:39.626
Yup, it's, uh, 456 Elm Street,
suite 315.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.361
Yeah, you got it, Nancy.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.363
If you could just make sure
to have those in by 5:00,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.265
that would be amazing.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.100
You too.
Merry Christmas.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.503
You get all
those baskets ordered?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.339
Almost.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.375
Well, if you're
not too busy,

17:55.408 --> 17:56.443
you should make sure

17:56.476 --> 17:57.277
you're home for
dinner tonight,

17:57.310 --> 17:58.845
because Roy invited
a friend over,

17:58.878 --> 18:00.813
and you would
finish out the table

18:00.847 --> 18:02.649
for the four of us.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.883
Sounds good.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.852
What? I thought
I added that to the cart.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.556
You look so pretty.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.590
Where are you going?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.125
I have
an interview today.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.126
Really?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.295
Yes.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.796
Okay, you have to add this.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.231
How perfect is this?
What are the odds?

18:18.265 --> 18:19.266
Hair up, hair up.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.400
Okay.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.701
I love what
you're wearing,

18:21.734 --> 18:22.902
but I feel like it might
be chilly in there, and...

18:22.935 --> 18:23.903
Just need
a little extra?

18:23.936 --> 18:24.904
Yeah.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.206
Better?

18:26.239 --> 18:27.507
I love that.
Let's zsuzsh you.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.608
Zsuzsh you...
You're good.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.511
I'm late!

18:32.845 --> 18:34.581
I love you,
you're gonna kill it.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.582
Stand up straight.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.584
Okay, bye!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.419
After your meeting
with Harry this morning,

18:39.452 --> 18:42.222
you have an 11:00 call
with Mark Brice,

18:42.255 --> 18:43.756
and then lunch
down at the Supper Club.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.326
Oh, and I received
confirmation from Gwen

18:46.359 --> 18:47.560
that the last
of the gift baskets

18:47.594 --> 18:48.728
have been sent out,

18:48.761 --> 18:50.530
and you've already
received 10 thank you's,

18:50.563 --> 18:52.465
and two dinner
invitations.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.901
For the...

18:54.934 --> 18:56.503
For the baskets?

18:56.536 --> 18:59.306
That's right.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.911
Hi.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.379
: Hey, babe.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.547
I didn't think you were
back until tomorrow.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.581
What if I said I missed you?

19:08.615 --> 19:09.949
Well, I don't think
I'd believe you.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.384
Well then, actually,

19:11.418 --> 19:12.652
my last meeting
got pushed to next week.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.287
Did you get my message
about Harry?

19:14.321 --> 19:16.523
About his sentimental
attachment to the company?

19:16.556 --> 19:18.225
Yes.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.459
That's right. He's usually
a cranky old Scrooge,

19:19.492 --> 19:20.893
but when it comes to
that relic of a business,

19:20.927 --> 19:22.729
he turns to mush.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.564
Use it.
Get that price up.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.466
Hang-- hang on.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.602
Charlie Baker.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.803
What color black do you want?

19:30.837 --> 19:31.938
Sorry?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.840
I'm just picking out
the suit you wanted,

19:33.873 --> 19:35.942
and I need to know
what color black to get.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.845
Whatever, just...
just black.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.480
There's not really, like,
a "just black".

19:40.513 --> 19:41.748
I mean, there's "midnight,"
there's "ebony,"

19:41.781 --> 19:42.815
there's "charcoal..."

19:42.849 --> 19:44.951
Yeah, yeah, I--
Just hang on.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.586
Hi.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.354
I'm going to have to
call you back

19:47.387 --> 19:48.621
after my meeting with Harry.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.557
Okay. Make sure
you kill it in there.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.225
Hi. Sorry.
Bye, babe.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.526
McCallum and Third.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.295
Okay, okay.
Let's go.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.764
Hey, Sal,
can you think of, like,

19:57.797 --> 19:58.831
a great purple tie
you might have

19:58.865 --> 20:00.300
with a pop of black?

20:00.333 --> 20:01.901
The one on the left.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.303
No, no, no.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.737
No more purple, okay?

20:04.771 --> 20:07.240
Midnight, charcoal, black.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.675
Just black, all right?

20:08.708 --> 20:09.976
I was talking about
for the tie.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.544
I...

20:11.578 --> 20:12.545
We already talked about this.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.913
I already have a tie.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.415
Okay, let me fill you in,

20:15.448 --> 20:16.983
Men with ties are a lot like
women with shoes,

20:17.016 --> 20:18.184
you seriously
cannot have too many.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.887
I mean, my friends have
staged an intervention

20:20.920 --> 20:22.422
'cause of the amount
of shoes I have, but--

20:22.455 --> 20:23.523
Hey, listen, I'm going to
have to talk to you later.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.359
Harry.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.460
Charlie Baker.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.562
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.300
Charlie Baker?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.369
Well, what a pleasure.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.904
Thank you so much

20:37.937 --> 20:40.039
for that outstanding
gift basket.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.509
20-year-old McGinty Scotch,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.011
how did you know
that was my favorite?

20:45.044 --> 20:46.846
And the wife has been
over the moon

20:46.879 --> 20:48.448
with those
French macaroons.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.949
I was... just happy to--

20:49.982 --> 20:51.418
Well, I am in a mood

20:51.451 --> 20:52.985
to return
some of that good will.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.355
So, let's do business.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.423
Great.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.324
Gentlemen?

21:00.627 --> 21:02.329
It went great.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.663
I mean, Harry was
more than willing to negotiate.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.765
I know, can you believe it?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.434
Yes, well,
I ensured him that...

21:09.001 --> 21:11.438
Hey, listen, uh,
I gotta go.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.605
I'll-- I'll call you back.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.706
Okay, bye.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.010
It's black.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.045
Mm-hmm.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.079
It's midnight black

21:20.112 --> 21:21.414
with hint of navy blue

21:21.448 --> 21:23.883
to offset your pale complexion.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.753
So now you think
I'm overweight and pale.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.020
I didn't mean it like that,

21:28.054 --> 21:30.390
I'm just trying to
bring out your best.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.591
Let's try it on.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.793
Arms in.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.000
Still fitting
a little snug, huh?

21:41.033 --> 21:43.436
Well, at least
the color works.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.004
Yup.

21:47.707 --> 21:53.546
So how did you know
that Harry liked McGinty scotch?

21:53.580 --> 21:55.081
I did my research.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.418
Like with Owen's teacher?

21:58.451 --> 21:59.552
I firmly believe

21:59.586 --> 22:00.953
that every present
that someone gets

22:00.987 --> 22:03.456
should make them feel
really special and appreciated,

22:03.490 --> 22:04.857
which is why

22:04.891 --> 22:05.725
every present I get
for my clients is personal.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.894
But you...

22:07.927 --> 22:09.962
Charlie Baker,

22:09.996 --> 22:12.365
not a big fan
of the personal touch.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.002
Well...

22:16.035 --> 22:18.405
for what it's worth,

22:18.438 --> 22:20.907
it really did
make the difference,

22:20.940 --> 22:23.643
so...

22:23.676 --> 22:26.012
thank you.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.915
You're welcome.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.454
I've got to get
to another meeting.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.855
Thank you.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.624
I'll just...

22:37.657 --> 22:38.991
Yeah.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.817
Wow, it smells
so good in here.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.688
You made a pot roast.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.822
This looks amazing.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.426
Are we celebrating something?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.427
Did you get your job?

23:14.461 --> 23:15.695
I haven't heard yet,

23:15.728 --> 23:16.729
but come on,

23:16.763 --> 23:18.064
Roy's friend
just got here,

23:18.097 --> 23:19.732
and we're about ready
to sit down for dinner.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.568
Who?

23:22.769 --> 23:24.170
I'll get you
a drink.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.805
David, this is
my sister, Gwen.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.508
Hi there, David.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.042
A pleasure to meet you, Gwen.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.177
Great to meet you, too.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.479
Great shirt.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.546
Well, why don't you
have a seat?

23:33.580 --> 23:35.448
I know you must be hungry

23:35.482 --> 23:36.616
from your very,
very busy day.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.784
Yeah.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.586
What is that you, uh, do

23:39.619 --> 23:41.688
that keeps you
so busy?

23:41.721 --> 23:43.856
Oh, I'm a personal shopper.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.792
Or stylist,
some people say "stylist."

23:45.825 --> 23:46.726
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.960
Wow.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.562
David's a psychiatrist.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.230
Really?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.732
Psychologist, actually.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.933
You're--
You're a psychologist?

23:53.966 --> 23:55.101
Yeah.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.235
Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.236
Sure.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.505
Okay,

23:58.538 --> 24:00.139
say I knew somebody,

24:00.172 --> 24:01.674
and they had just suffered
a great loss,

24:01.708 --> 24:03.042
like their wife died,

24:03.075 --> 24:04.744
do you think that could
make that person unbending,

24:04.777 --> 24:05.712
or a little self-absorbed?

24:05.745 --> 24:07.046
Absolutely.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.949
This is so helpful for me,
you have no idea.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.184
Like, I could probably help him
get him out of his shell, right?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.986
Like, I could help show him

24:14.020 --> 24:15.522
that there's
more to life than work.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.489
Like, he should be spending
more time with his kid,

24:16.523 --> 24:17.624
and it's Christmas--

24:17.657 --> 24:18.625
Hypothetically.

24:18.658 --> 24:21.060
Yeah, hypothetically.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.595
Uh...

24:22.629 --> 24:24.797
Yeah, I'd have to
meet this person first to...

24:24.831 --> 24:26.633
I'm no doctor, but--

24:26.666 --> 24:27.967
Hi, Gwen,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.168
why don't you come help me
pick out the wine?

24:29.201 --> 24:30.202
Oh, we actually--

24:30.236 --> 24:31.571
Yeah, no,
it's right over here.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.272
Steph, it's starting
to make sense to me now,

24:33.305 --> 24:34.674
why he is the way that he is.

24:34.707 --> 24:35.742
I mean, why he's so shut down.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.243
- What are you doing?
- What?

24:37.276 --> 24:38.845
Grilling a potential date
about Charlie?

24:38.878 --> 24:39.879
Who, if I have to remind you,
by the way

24:39.912 --> 24:41.147
made you so angry.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.515
Yeah, that's just it,

24:42.549 --> 24:43.750
he made me so angry,

24:43.783 --> 24:45.117
until I understand,

24:45.151 --> 24:46.118
and now...

24:46.152 --> 24:47.186
I get it, I get it.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.755
I mean, who could
blame the guy?

24:48.788 --> 24:51.290
He's so closed off,
but of course he is, you know?

24:51.323 --> 24:52.992
Gwen,

24:53.025 --> 24:54.193
please don't make him
another one of your missions.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.795
Okay, I just feel like

24:55.828 --> 24:56.929
I could help bring
his spirit back.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.264
Okay, and what about David?

24:58.297 --> 24:59.632
Who?

24:59.666 --> 25:00.633
The psychiatrist.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.134
- That guy?
- Yes.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.603
The psychologist?

25:03.636 --> 25:04.236
You really think that's
as good as I can do?

25:04.270 --> 25:05.672
Gosh, have a little faith--

25:05.705 --> 25:06.673
I mean, he's cute.

25:06.706 --> 25:07.674
He's a nice guy.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.675
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.609
He's a nice guy.

25:10.877 --> 25:11.944
Pat, I need your help.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.145
I have a huge surprise
for Charlie,

25:13.179 --> 25:14.180
and I need 30 minutes
in his office alone.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.214
A surprise?

25:15.247 --> 25:16.282
Mm-hmm.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.150
Charlie's not big on surprises.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.085
Trust me,
he's going to love this,

25:19.118 --> 25:20.720
and if he says anything,

25:20.753 --> 25:21.287
I'm just gonna be like,
"I don't know what happened.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.288
"The door was left open,

25:22.321 --> 25:23.623
"and I don't know,
she was out.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.490
She must have gone
to the bathroom."

25:24.523 --> 25:25.825
It'll be totally fine.
What do you say?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.060
Okay, go.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.261
Quick.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.330
Really?
You get cooler every day.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.932
Why did that
man get mad

25:32.965 --> 25:35.034
when you told him
his company wasn't worth

25:35.067 --> 25:37.570
as much as
he thought?

25:37.604 --> 25:40.773
Because some people
don't like to hear the truth.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.942
Well, it's better
when you tell the truth,

25:42.975 --> 25:45.344
'cause if you tell a lie,
you might get in trouble.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.846
Exactly--
and you remember that.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.047
Owen!

25:48.080 --> 25:50.049
What are you doing here?
No school today?

25:50.082 --> 25:51.851
It's bring your child
to work day.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.853
Wow.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.022
Well, isn't this day
just full of surprises.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.156
Right, Charlie?

25:57.189 --> 25:59.058
You bet.
Pat, can you get Greg Smith

25:59.091 --> 26:00.026
on the phone
for me, please?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.628
Of course. Right away.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.729
Great. Thanks.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.898
Oh, boy.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.800
Surprise!

26:15.642 --> 26:16.776
Wow!

26:16.809 --> 26:18.310
You like it?

26:18.344 --> 26:19.612
I love it.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.748
Who are you?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.350
I am Gwen Burke,
stylist extraordinaire.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.985
High five it.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.053
Whoo!

26:27.086 --> 26:29.121
That's putting it mildly.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.123
Thanks, Dad,
this is the best.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.359
Well, I mean, I didn't...

26:33.392 --> 26:34.961
Well, he must
have known

26:34.994 --> 26:37.263
that you would
really love it.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.868
Sorry.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.169
Did you...
know about this?

26:43.202 --> 26:45.738
Well... not really,

26:45.772 --> 26:48.074
but it is a nice
surprise, isn't it?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.308
Check it out.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.912
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas... *

26:54.046 --> 26:55.715
Karl, yeah, listen,

26:55.748 --> 26:56.849
I'm...

26:56.883 --> 26:58.217
No, it's a toy.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.220
* --And a happy New Year

27:01.253 --> 27:02.722
Look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.856
Okay? Yeah.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.393
- Gwen?
- Yeah?

27:07.426 --> 27:10.129
Would it be possible
to see Sal about another suit,

27:10.162 --> 27:11.363
considering the last two
haven't really worked out?

27:11.397 --> 27:13.666
Yeah, of course.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.867
But you're just going to
have to go with me.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.268
Um, I'm sorry,

27:16.302 --> 27:17.670
but isn't the point
of having a personal shopper

27:17.704 --> 27:20.439
so you don't have to shop?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.174
Yes, that's a perk,

27:22.208 --> 27:24.076
but your measurements
are all off,

27:24.110 --> 27:27.680
'cause I just completely flaked

27:27.714 --> 27:28.314
and forgot to bring
my measuring tape.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.217
Okay.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.284
Okay, you know what, Pat, um,

27:32.318 --> 27:33.886
we're going to
cancel everything

27:33.920 --> 27:35.955
for the next hour,

27:35.988 --> 27:37.857
because I guess somebody...

27:37.890 --> 27:39.892
...has to go shopping.

27:39.926 --> 27:42.962
Oh, yes, we have gone up
another size.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.835
Well, you know how
these Italian suits fit,

27:48.868 --> 27:51.237
they always fit small.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.805
Yeah, they're...

27:52.839 --> 27:53.840
Those Italians...
they're known for that, right?

27:53.873 --> 27:54.974
The...

27:55.007 --> 27:56.943
Dad, look, you should
check this out!

27:56.976 --> 27:58.377
You have to get it.

28:00.847 --> 28:01.748
Try it on!

28:02.782 --> 28:03.783
No.

28:03.816 --> 28:04.751
Oh, come on.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.785
Please?

28:05.818 --> 28:06.919
Dad, if you like it,

28:06.953 --> 28:08.087
you can wear it
at Christmas,

28:08.120 --> 28:10.823
and I could wear
my Christmas sweater.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.091
Hear him?

28:12.124 --> 28:13.993
Sweater parties are
all the rage nowadays.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.061
See?

28:15.094 --> 28:16.328
Try it on for us.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.898
Yes, try it on for us,
please, please, please.

28:18.931 --> 28:19.999
Please!

28:20.032 --> 28:21.000
Please?

28:21.033 --> 28:22.368
All right.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.376
Light it up, please,

28:30.409 --> 28:31.377
light it up.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.311
Oh, light it up!

28:36.415 --> 28:37.817
Okay, let me get
a picture.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.486
Let me get a picture
of you with your dad.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.421
- Okay, ready?
- All right.

28:42.454 --> 28:43.856
All right, Sal,
get in there, bud.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.325
One, two, three.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.359
Merry Christmas!

28:47.393 --> 28:49.361
Merry Christmas.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.365
- You wear it very well.
- Thanks.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.903
I still think that
you should get that sweater.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.971
I mean, I have
some pull with Sal.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.873
Dad, look it's Santa!

29:00.907 --> 29:03.142
Oh, wow!

29:03.175 --> 29:04.443
Can I go and see him?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.445
Sorry, Owen,

29:06.478 --> 29:08.014
I've really got to
get back to the office.

29:08.047 --> 29:08.981
I could take him.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.917
No, I...

29:10.950 --> 29:12.985
Really, I couldn't
bother you,

29:13.019 --> 29:14.821
and besides,
it's bring your kid to work day.

29:14.854 --> 29:15.822
Owen and I have
another meeting to go to.

29:15.855 --> 29:19.025
But, Dad, your meetings
are kind of boring,

29:19.058 --> 29:20.259
and it's Santa.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.994
Yeah, meetings are boring.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.195
Let me take him to see Santa.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.530
Are you sure you don't mind?

29:24.563 --> 29:25.965
Don't mind at all.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.333
Okay.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.400
Thanks, Gwen.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.136
I will see you
when I see you then.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.070
Put in a good word
for me, huh?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.038
Go get 'em.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.105
Okay.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.140
All right. Oh, Owen, look.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.075
You're next,
you're next.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.378
Here, in case Santa
is afraid of reptiles.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.512
Oh, good thinking.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.948
Okay, tell him
how good you were.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.191
Smile.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.562
Did you tell Santa
your Christmas wish?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.564
I did.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.432
I was wishing for my Dad
to go tobogganing

30:00.466 --> 30:02.869
up at our cabin.

30:02.902 --> 30:03.936
That's where we used to spend

30:03.970 --> 30:05.571
all of our
Christmases.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.206
Where do you spend
your Christmases now?

30:07.239 --> 30:08.307
At home.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.842
It's okay, it's just,

30:09.876 --> 30:11.277
before my mom died,

30:11.310 --> 30:13.545
he would spend
the whole holidays with me,

30:13.579 --> 30:16.248
but now he's just too busy.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.086
Well, I'm sure

30:20.119 --> 30:21.520
Santa's going to make
your Christmas wish come true,

30:21.553 --> 30:22.855
because that's what he does.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.423
You want to go get
some hot chocolate?

30:24.456 --> 30:25.457
Yes!

30:25.491 --> 30:26.859
Whoo! Me too.

30:26.893 --> 30:27.894
Let's go.

30:27.927 --> 30:28.827
All right,
hold my hand.

30:33.432 --> 30:34.566
No, I got you.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.035
Ah, I just got you!

30:37.036 --> 30:38.004
You missed.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.005
I didn't miss.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.473
Oh, hi!

30:41.507 --> 30:43.209
Hi! Hello.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.877
Sorry if I was running
a little late,

30:44.911 --> 30:46.612
I just picked up a few things
on my way out.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.314
Oh, it's fine.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.250
We got hot chocolate
and we got candy canes.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.618
Charlie,
I'm glad to see

30:52.651 --> 30:55.121
you finally took my advice
and got Owen a nanny.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.322
Oh...

30:56.355 --> 30:58.190
Gwen isn't, um...

30:58.224 --> 30:59.358
- Not a nanny.
- Oh.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.326
Different career.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.560
Yeah.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.195
She's my personal shopper.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.064
Oh, speaking of which,

31:05.097 --> 31:06.432
I actually
picked you up something

31:06.465 --> 31:08.500
I think you're really
going to like.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.536
This might
be a little too much.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.637
It's this.

31:11.670 --> 31:12.538
Okay, that's the wrong bag.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.275
Wrong bag.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.213
What do you think?

31:21.247 --> 31:25.317
We're corporate professionals,
not Vegas entertainers.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.518
I hope you kept the receipt.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.088
I don't know,
it's not the worst.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.589
It kind of...

31:30.622 --> 31:31.590
shimmers.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.059
Yeah, it...

31:33.092 --> 31:34.093
I think it's great.
It's festive, right?

31:34.126 --> 31:36.428
It's festive. It's festive...

31:36.462 --> 31:38.064
It's festive.

31:38.097 --> 31:41.233
I mean, at least you didn't
buy me that sweater.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.901
It was really bad.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.004
You should have seen it,

31:45.037 --> 31:46.038
it lit up,
and it was...

31:46.072 --> 31:48.707
Well, we should
probably get ready

31:48.740 --> 31:50.309
for our dinner
reservations.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.277
Dinner.
I completely forgot.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.578
Can Gwen come?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.680
Aw, that's
really sweet,

31:54.713 --> 31:55.681
but I have plans tonight.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.016
It was so nice
to meet you.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.350
Victoria Dane.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.352
Victoria. Awesome.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.154
I had a lot of fun
hanging out with you today.

32:02.188 --> 32:05.357
Okay, you guys,
have a great dinner.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.325
Bye, Owen.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.136
Ha!

32:17.169 --> 32:18.204
: I got you.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.438
Hey, stop!

32:19.471 --> 32:20.372
: You're going
to knock off my peppers.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.707
I know,
don't do that.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.309
: Don't you knock off
my peppers.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.510
Don't mess with my peppers.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.112
: I'm the pepper king.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.654
Oh, hey!

32:35.687 --> 32:37.723
Roy is just about
to fire up the barbecue

32:37.756 --> 32:39.391
for his famous burgers.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.659
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you in?

32:40.692 --> 32:42.628
Yeah. Yeah...
That sounds great.

32:42.661 --> 32:43.729
You okay?

32:43.762 --> 32:45.097
Yeah, I'm good.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.067
I'm just--
I've had such a long day,

32:48.100 --> 32:50.036
but I'm going to go
unwind for a little bit.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.038
Yeah, I'll see
you guys for dinner.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.673
You're being cute right now,
you know that?

32:54.706 --> 32:55.774
Keeping it alive,

32:55.807 --> 32:57.243
keeping that
spark alive.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.549
Victoria...

33:04.616 --> 33:06.018
Dane.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.188
There you are.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.424
"Victoria Dane,

33:12.458 --> 33:14.093
"poised to becoming
one of the youngest partners

33:14.126 --> 33:15.661
"at Roth and Holtz

33:15.694 --> 33:18.530
with Charlie Baker
of VistaSun Equities."

33:18.564 --> 33:21.100
Well, isn't that just cute.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.301
Wow.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.302
Whoop-dee-doo.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.046
Hi. You've reached Linda.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.314
I'm out of the country,

33:35.347 --> 33:37.349
but leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.550
Hi, Mom.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.219
It's me,

33:40.252 --> 33:41.520
your youngest daughter.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.821
I miss you.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.590
Um... will you call me

33:44.623 --> 33:46.058
when you and Carlos
hit dry land?

33:46.092 --> 33:47.259
I think you're probably
still cruising.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.694
Bye.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.436
Oh, no.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.105
What?

34:05.211 --> 34:07.079
Why couldn't we just go
to the Burger Cellar?

34:07.113 --> 34:08.614
Because this is where everyone
is eating now, sweetheart.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.116
Don't worry, buddy,

34:10.149 --> 34:11.217
I'm sure the burger
you ordered will be great.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.217
Okay?

34:12.251 --> 34:13.418
Thank you.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.321
So, how did
your personal shopper

34:15.353 --> 34:17.688
end up taking Owen
to go see Santa?

34:17.723 --> 34:19.358
Uh, I was in a fitting,

34:19.391 --> 34:20.659
and then I had to
head back to the office,

34:20.692 --> 34:22.494
and so she offered.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.330
Well, you obviously
know her well enough

34:24.362 --> 34:25.431
to trust her with your kid.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.831
She's awesome!

34:26.864 --> 34:29.701
She even decorated Daddy's
office for Christmas.

34:29.735 --> 34:30.702
Oh, really?

34:30.735 --> 34:31.837
She even knows

34:31.870 --> 34:33.871
where the best hot chocolate is.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.574
And everyone
at the stores know her

34:36.608 --> 34:38.510
'cause she's so nice.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.411
Hmm.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.214
Here's
your appetizer.

34:42.248 --> 34:45.251
And a Wagu burger

34:45.284 --> 34:47.219
with wasabi
cotton candy foam.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.221
Why is everything so foamy?

34:49.255 --> 34:52.591
It's called
"gastro molecular."

34:52.623 --> 34:54.592
Hey, listen,
I was thinking,

34:54.626 --> 34:57.563
what if I made a pitch
to VistaSun?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.598
I mean, if you and I
were at the same firm,

34:59.631 --> 35:01.800
we could move
corporate mountains.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.135
And we've already talked
about becoming partners--

35:05.437 --> 35:07.439
Owen, are you all right?
Are you all right?

35:07.473 --> 35:09.175
So spicy.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.576
I'm sure it's not that bad.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.278
I'm sorry.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.379
Look, why don't you play
with your lizard or something

35:13.412 --> 35:15.381
while Victoria and I
finish up, okay?

35:15.414 --> 35:16.282
And then we'll get a burger
for you on the way back home--

35:16.315 --> 35:17.883
My lizard! Gwen has it!

35:17.916 --> 35:21.620
I gave it to her when
I went to see Santa.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.488
I can't go to sleep
without it.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.163
Hi, this is so weird,

35:31.197 --> 35:33.565
I literally
just found the lizard.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.434
Yeah, well, I just heard--

35:35.467 --> 35:36.768
Is it Gwen?
Does she have it?

35:36.802 --> 35:39.305
Can we go
and get it?

35:39.338 --> 35:40.539
Would it be possible
to come by there

35:40.572 --> 35:41.640
and pick up the lizard?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.409
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.877
Um... here. Yeah.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.913
I'm gonna-- I'll just text you
my sister's address,

35:47.946 --> 35:49.848
and then you guys can just
come around the back door.

35:49.881 --> 35:50.882
Great.

35:50.916 --> 35:51.883
Well, thank you.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.219
We'll be there shortly.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.720
Okay, yeah.
See you-- See you soon.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.657
Can we go, Dad?

35:58.690 --> 36:01.260
Your father hasn't even
gotten his dinner yet.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.562
Actually, you know what,
it's fine.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.697
I'm gonna get Owen's lizard,

36:05.731 --> 36:08.634
and get him
some real food, and...

36:08.667 --> 36:10.536
No, no, you know what,
it's totally fine.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.239
Actually, I think I saw
Clark Bishop back there,

36:13.272 --> 36:14.840
and I should be asking him

36:14.873 --> 36:15.874
if his equity firm is
interested in Greenwood.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.276
So...

36:17.309 --> 36:18.444
I gotta go.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.611
Yeah.
Thanks, babe.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.919
Hello?

36:27.953 --> 36:29.788
Hi.

36:29.821 --> 36:31.290
Sorry, I hope we're
not disturbing you.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.859
Not at all. Come on in.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.960
Um, Charlie,

36:34.993 --> 36:37.596
this is my brother-in-law, Roy,

36:37.629 --> 36:38.630
and this is
my sister, Stephanie,

36:38.664 --> 36:39.631
and this is Owen.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.667
Nice to meet you.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.734
Is that a Delouthe suit?

36:42.768 --> 36:44.870
Yes.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.340
Well, sweet.

36:48.374 --> 36:49.275
Tell you what's really sweet

36:49.308 --> 36:50.642
is that classic
parked in the driveway.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.311
That's my car.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.945
Yeah,
that's Daisy.

36:53.979 --> 36:57.516
She was our dad's car,
and then I adopted her.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.418
Are those burgers?

36:59.451 --> 37:00.919
Those are burgers.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.554
Would you like
a burger?

37:02.588 --> 37:03.922
Oh, no, we can't stay.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.591
Please, Dad?
I'm starving.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.293
I didn't even have dinner.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.396
That's not true.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.730
That's a...

37:11.763 --> 37:13.799
Owen-- He ate. Owen ate.

37:13.832 --> 37:14.900
It was just a little too spicy.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.035
Wasabi
or something.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.604
Well then, you gotta
have a burger.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.339
You want one?
Why don't you guys stay?

37:20.372 --> 37:21.540
We've got enough
food, right, Roy?

37:21.573 --> 37:22.541
Right, Steph?

37:22.574 --> 37:23.675
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:23.709 --> 37:24.710
Are you sure?

37:24.743 --> 37:25.777
Yeah.

37:25.811 --> 37:26.778
Okay.

37:26.812 --> 37:27.846
Stay.

37:27.879 --> 37:28.980
Here, let me
take that.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.716
Come on, Owen,
let's get you a seat.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.485
Our mom and dad did not
know what to do with her.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.288
She was determined
to meet Santa Claus.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.356
But instead of
staying up all night

37:37.389 --> 37:38.590
like most kids,

37:38.624 --> 37:41.427
Gwen actually wanted to
catch him in action,

37:41.460 --> 37:44.796
so she actually
pulled up a ladder

37:44.830 --> 37:45.931
and climbed up onto
the top of the roof,

37:45.964 --> 37:48.334
and spent
all night up there.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.001
Did you see him?

37:50.035 --> 37:51.370
It's really
embarrassing,

37:51.403 --> 37:54.440
but, no, Owen,
I fell asleep.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.041
Yeah, and, thankfully,
did not fall off the roof.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.743
Yeah, but you want to know
the crazy thing?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.578
When I woke up,
someone had covered me

37:59.611 --> 38:01.513
with a red blanket
with white snowflakes

38:01.547 --> 38:02.814
and green
Christmas trees.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.450
Santa's blanket?

38:05.751 --> 38:07.453
I think it was.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.622
Wow.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.425
It sounds like
you were a... handful.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.394
No, it wasn't...

38:15.427 --> 38:16.695
I was just... determined.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.729
Right?

38:17.763 --> 38:18.930
Oh, yeah, for sure.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.699
Determined.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.902
Yeah, well, don't I know it.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.775
Hey, Roy, um,

38:29.808 --> 38:31.109
why don't you
grab the plates,

38:31.142 --> 38:32.544
and Owen and I

38:32.578 --> 38:34.012
will go grab some
marshmallows for the fire.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.048
Do we all get marshmallows?

38:37.082 --> 38:38.049
Yeah, if you
clean up the plates.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.018
He's very food motivated.

38:40.051 --> 38:40.986
Right, Roy?

38:41.019 --> 38:41.987
Yeah.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.929
So you live here
with your sister?

38:50.962 --> 38:52.631
Yeah, I moved in here

38:52.664 --> 38:53.799
after our mom remarried

38:53.832 --> 38:56.402
and then, um,
sold our family house.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.371
But I'm here just until

38:59.405 --> 39:01.039
I can save up enough money
to buy my own condo.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.842
And your...

39:03.875 --> 39:06.645
Well, I mean your father,
is he...

39:06.678 --> 39:08.013
Oh, he passed away.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.415
I'm so sorry to hear that.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.482
Thank you.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.150
Yeah, it was
a few years ago.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.653
We loved him so much,

39:14.686 --> 39:18.089
and so for me, my car
is, like, very sentimental,

39:18.123 --> 39:21.092
even though she's a pain a neck
and breaks down all the time.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.761
What about you?

39:22.794 --> 39:24.162
Do you have
a big family?

39:24.195 --> 39:25.497
Uh, it's just me.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.633
Really?

39:27.666 --> 39:30.536
My parents like to spend
their winters down south,

39:30.569 --> 39:33.772
so during the holidays,
it's just Owen and I.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.974
Well, that's great.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.843
He's really lucky
to have you.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.848
It's freeze--

39:42.881 --> 39:45.917
It got really cold out here.

39:45.951 --> 39:46.885
Oh, yeah.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.155
Thank you.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.857
That's really sweet.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.827
Here, your phone.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.129
I think it's in
the right pocket.

39:58.163 --> 39:59.665
That's left.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.766
No, I think it's here.

40:00.799 --> 40:01.733
No, I'm pretty sure--

40:01.767 --> 40:02.701
I got it, I got it.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.669
Oh.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.139
Okay.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.575
Look what
Stephanie made me!

40:09.608 --> 40:10.642
Wow!

40:10.676 --> 40:12.444
A marshmallow snowman.

40:12.478 --> 40:13.479
Look at that.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.046
It's nice, huh?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.782
Ah, got one, too,
Roy, huh?

40:16.815 --> 40:18.149
Always.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.451
Always.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.686
I could get you
one of your own

40:20.719 --> 40:21.787
just like Roy here.

40:21.820 --> 40:22.821
Well, thank you,

40:22.854 --> 40:24.990
but, uh, it's a school night,

40:25.023 --> 40:26.825
and it's already past
someone's bedtime.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.193
Oh, that reminds me...

40:28.226 --> 40:30.462
Owen, I was just
talking to someone,

40:30.496 --> 40:33.231
and he really
loves marshmallows.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.466
Oh, ho!

40:35.567 --> 40:37.202
You didn't
talk to him.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.470
I did.

40:38.504 --> 40:39.204
Would you like
a marshmallow?

40:39.237 --> 40:40.171
Cool.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.873
No--

40:41.907 --> 40:44.776
We'd better
get going.

40:44.810 --> 40:45.744
Here's your coat.
Thank you.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.715
Thank you for dinner.

40:49.748 --> 40:50.749
It was lovely.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.917
We were happy to have you.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.652
Oh, Gwen, that reminds me,

40:53.685 --> 40:55.086
the Christmas party
is coming up.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.722
I'll need gifts
for some of my colleagues.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.256
Yeah. I'm on it.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.692
Hey, and
thanks again.

41:00.726 --> 41:03.128
Yeah, it was fun.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.195
Bye, Owen!

41:04.229 --> 41:05.764
- Bye.
- Get home safe.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.569
Hmm...

41:10.602 --> 41:12.270
What?

41:12.303 --> 41:13.505
Hmm, well...

41:13.539 --> 41:14.773
What?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.608
I can see why
you want to help him.

41:16.642 --> 41:17.843
I mean, he's handsome,

41:17.876 --> 41:20.646
and you two definitely
have a little something.

41:20.679 --> 41:21.713
Stop it.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.081
No. Really.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.784
He's... He's my client

41:25.817 --> 41:29.020
that, just, he needs
a little more encouragement.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.722
Besides,
he has a girlfriend,

41:30.756 --> 41:32.257
so there's that.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.192
Well, if that's the case,
then you'd better be careful.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.796
Hey-- You know what,
did you see it?

41:37.829 --> 41:38.930
There's something.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.067
I was almost
like, "Ooh...!"

41:42.100 --> 41:43.168
There's definitely
something.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.202
Yeah, yeah.

42:00.619 --> 42:01.587
Ah!

42:04.923 --> 42:06.124
That isn't going to work.

42:09.795 --> 42:10.729
Ah!

42:12.030 --> 42:13.164
No! Jeez...

42:17.869 --> 42:19.137
* Boop-boop-boop...

42:20.205 --> 42:21.139
Ah!

42:24.342 --> 42:26.645
Hey, what do you think?

42:26.678 --> 42:27.879
Who's that for again?

42:27.913 --> 42:29.114
This is for Frank,

42:29.147 --> 42:30.749
in accounting,

42:30.782 --> 42:31.750
'cause he goes caving
with his wife every weekend.

42:31.783 --> 42:33.184
Ooh, and check this out.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.753
This is for Tina in sales

42:34.786 --> 42:36.054
'cause she's
a habitual gum chewer.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.088
But isn't this
very cute?

42:37.122 --> 42:38.289
I had no idea.

42:38.323 --> 42:39.257
Sorry to
interrupt.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.358
Hi!

42:40.391 --> 42:41.727
I thought I should
let you know

42:41.760 --> 42:43.094
that the office party
is about to begin

42:43.128 --> 42:44.095
down in the Oyster lounge.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.363
Really? Right now?

42:45.396 --> 42:46.898
Okay, I gotta finish
wrapping these.

42:46.932 --> 42:48.299
Oh, gosh.

42:48.333 --> 42:51.236
But, uh...

42:52.337 --> 42:53.672
Merry Christmas, Pat.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.041
Thank you, Charlie.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.278
Oh...

43:00.311 --> 43:03.949
Oh, this...
this is wonderful.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.651
- Really?
- Oh, I love it.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.218
I've been needing
a backrest for my chair

43:07.252 --> 43:08.153
for the longest time.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.821
Thank you.

43:09.855 --> 43:11.022
Well, I'm just
glad you like it.

43:11.056 --> 43:13.091
It's perfect.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.827
Okay, well, I'd better
get down to this party.

43:15.861 --> 43:18.664
Well, Gwen, why don't you go?

43:18.697 --> 43:20.165
To the party?

43:20.198 --> 43:21.900
I don't work here.

43:21.933 --> 43:22.968
Like, that would be
very weird.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.936
Well, you are employed
by Charlie.

43:24.970 --> 43:25.937
Right, Charlie?

43:25.971 --> 43:26.972
Yeah, of course.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.139
Yeah, you--
you should come.

43:28.173 --> 43:29.875
- Really?
- Really, you should come.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.343
'Cause I can't
say no to a party.

43:32.377 --> 43:34.145
Well then,
I'll see you there.

43:34.179 --> 43:35.380
All right.

43:35.413 --> 43:36.181
Do I look okay?

43:36.214 --> 43:37.282
Fabulous.
That dress is perfect.

43:37.315 --> 43:38.750
Really? Okay.

43:38.784 --> 43:39.651
Gosh, I need
some deodorant.

43:48.794 --> 43:50.428
Perfect.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.963
This black suit
looks so good,

43:51.997 --> 43:52.998
but we need
a little something.

43:54.332 --> 43:56.134
Cufflinks.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.043
Perfect.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.978
Little sprig of green.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.681
You just can't
help yourself, can you?

44:09.715 --> 44:10.982
Mo.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.318
Sometimes, I wish
I could turn it off.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.419
Charlie!

44:15.721 --> 44:17.088
Victoria.

44:17.122 --> 44:18.289
I thought you were in a meeting.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.825
It got canceled.

44:19.858 --> 44:21.426
So I thought
I'd come here

44:21.459 --> 44:23.394
and help make this party
a little more bearable for you.

44:23.428 --> 44:24.896
Gwen.

44:24.930 --> 44:26.131
I'm kind of surprised to see.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.033
I thought this was
an office party.

44:28.066 --> 44:29.100
Oh...

44:29.134 --> 44:30.869
I thought Gwen should come.

44:30.902 --> 44:33.204
I mean, it's, uh,
Christmas after all, right?

44:33.238 --> 44:35.707
The more the merrier.

44:35.741 --> 44:37.776
Of course.

44:37.809 --> 44:39.244
Speaking of,

44:39.277 --> 44:41.312
I think I'm ready for
a glass of Christmas cheer.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.848
Shall we?

44:52.157 --> 44:53.358
You scared me.

44:53.391 --> 44:55.160
I'm sorry.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.362
Christmas cheer.
Puh-lease.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.430
That woman wouldn't know
how to be merry

44:59.464 --> 45:00.431
if she tried.

45:00.465 --> 45:01.967
Stop...

45:02.000 --> 45:03.501
All she's interested in
is climbing the ladder,

45:03.534 --> 45:05.971
and Charlie
is just a rung.

45:06.004 --> 45:07.438
Pat, you don't think
she loves him?

45:07.472 --> 45:09.140
No, I don't.

45:09.174 --> 45:10.508
I think she's more
interested in him

45:10.541 --> 45:13.278
as a business partner
than a life partner.

45:13.311 --> 45:14.980
And what about him?

45:15.013 --> 45:17.048
She's just part of
his process

45:17.082 --> 45:17.916
of throwing himself
into his work.

45:17.949 --> 45:21.086
That's the only reason
they're together.

45:21.119 --> 45:23.421
Oh, I have to go,
I'm on game duty.

45:23.454 --> 45:24.522
Okay.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.024
All right, everyone!

45:26.057 --> 45:27.525
It's time for
our favorite Christmas game--

45:27.558 --> 45:30.428
"Name That Carol"!

45:32.530 --> 45:33.765
"Jingle Bells!"

45:33.799 --> 45:35.033
"Toyland!"

45:35.066 --> 45:36.001
"Joy to the World!"

45:36.034 --> 45:37.803
Nope.

45:37.836 --> 45:38.536
"Up On the Housetop."

45:38.569 --> 45:40.105
Wow!

45:40.138 --> 45:41.940
Well, we have
a winner.

45:41.973 --> 45:43.441
Okay, let's hear it.

45:45.243 --> 45:46.812
I mean, you have to
sing some of the song

45:46.845 --> 45:47.779
when you get it right.

45:47.813 --> 45:48.546
That's right.

45:48.579 --> 45:49.848
Oh.

45:49.881 --> 45:50.949
Oh, um...

45:50.982 --> 45:52.117
Just sing a little bit.

45:52.150 --> 45:55.386
I don't...
know-know it.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.823
All right, then.

45:57.856 --> 45:59.825
Moving on to the next.

46:03.194 --> 46:04.362
"Silent Night!"

46:04.395 --> 46:06.131
We have a tie!

46:06.164 --> 46:07.799
No, I was first!
I said it--

46:07.833 --> 46:09.134
Let's have a duet.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.973
Come on, Charlie.

46:24.549 --> 46:25.550
Now I'm ready.

46:28.453 --> 46:32.090
* Silent night

46:32.123 --> 46:37.328
* Holy night

46:37.362 --> 46:41.166
* All is calm

46:41.199 --> 46:44.469
* All is bright

46:44.502 --> 46:48.907
* Round yon virgin

46:48.940 --> 46:52.343
* Mother and child

46:52.377 --> 46:55.881
* Holy infant

46:55.914 --> 47:00.852
* So tender and mild

47:00.886 --> 47:09.294
* Sleep in heavenly peace

47:09.327 --> 47:15.366
* Sleep
in heavenly peace... *

47:26.211 --> 47:28.980
Really great,
really great.

47:29.014 --> 47:29.915
I'm ready
for a refill.

47:29.948 --> 47:30.916
Oh.

47:39.490 --> 47:41.259
Oh, good grief.

48:48.293 --> 48:51.529
I can't believe these people
are actually your colleagues.

48:54.465 --> 48:57.635
I'd better get
back to Owen.

48:57.668 --> 48:59.604
Oh, thank goodness,
let's go.

49:04.042 --> 49:05.743
So, I put a little bug
in Barry's ear

49:05.776 --> 49:08.246
about me coming on
at VistaSun.

49:08.279 --> 49:09.347
We might actually get
the paperwork done

49:09.380 --> 49:10.648
before Christmas.

49:10.681 --> 49:13.251
It would give us
something to celebrate.

49:16.254 --> 49:17.355
Are you okay?

49:18.656 --> 49:20.458
Oh, hi.

49:20.491 --> 49:22.127
Yeah, I just, um,

49:22.160 --> 49:23.294
she's a little finicky
sometimes.

49:23.328 --> 49:24.729
Are you sure?

49:24.762 --> 49:26.331
I mean, I could
give you a ride, and...

49:26.364 --> 49:29.067
I'm good, but thank you.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.635
She's fine, it just needs
little boost.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.207
The magic touch.

49:36.241 --> 49:37.175
I should try
that tough love sometimes.

49:39.144 --> 49:41.746
All right, well, uh,
you guys have a good night.

49:41.779 --> 49:44.615
Hey, listen, I was thinking
about those accessories.

49:44.649 --> 49:47.285
Maybe I could use
a pair of cufflinks, or...

49:47.318 --> 49:49.554
Cufflinks.

49:49.587 --> 49:50.521
Great. I'm on it.

49:50.555 --> 49:51.656
Get home safe.

49:51.689 --> 49:53.591
Bye!

49:55.760 --> 49:57.762
You know,

49:57.795 --> 50:01.232
I saw some cufflinks
at Tiffany's.

50:01.266 --> 50:03.334
They were gold,
had real diamonds.

50:04.735 --> 50:06.504
If you want me to put in
a good word with Santa...

50:06.537 --> 50:08.673
I wouldn't want to wear
anything that flashy.

50:08.706 --> 50:11.076
You're successful,
Charlie.

50:11.109 --> 50:12.743
You should look it.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.347
You know, I saw some
other things while I was there.

50:16.381 --> 50:18.316
Some bracelets,
and some necklaces,

50:18.349 --> 50:20.551
and some...

50:20.585 --> 50:22.487
rings.

50:23.654 --> 50:25.556
Just in case this Santa
was wondering.

50:25.590 --> 50:28.293
We would be
a powerhouse, Charlie.

50:29.427 --> 50:30.395
You know that, right?

50:34.332 --> 50:35.633
Are you all right?

50:36.767 --> 50:38.669
Yeah, it's just...

50:40.171 --> 50:42.507
You're not allergic
to this... thing,

50:42.540 --> 50:44.642
are you?

50:44.675 --> 50:47.478
It's pine. I...

50:48.879 --> 50:50.348
Sorry.

50:50.381 --> 50:51.649
You know what, I should
put you in a cab.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.118
Okay? Just,
you know what,

50:53.151 --> 50:55.086
you should take something
for that, really.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.053
It's fine.

51:03.328 --> 51:04.695
Mm...

51:09.267 --> 51:10.268
Any good?

51:10.301 --> 51:11.402
Hmm?

51:12.670 --> 51:13.738
They're great.

51:13.771 --> 51:14.872
Bravo.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.509
Good, because
I am thinking about

51:18.543 --> 51:19.777
bringing back Mom's tradition

51:19.810 --> 51:21.379
of baking.

51:21.412 --> 51:22.079
You know, like she did
with us when we were little.

51:22.113 --> 51:25.150
Well, you're doing a good job.

51:25.183 --> 51:27.485
And I'm really glad that
that's going to be you

51:27.518 --> 51:28.653
carrying on the tradition,

51:28.686 --> 51:31.356
because I do not
have a talent for baking.

51:32.490 --> 51:33.558
Well, don't worry,

51:33.591 --> 51:35.860
because I don't want
to bake with you.

51:35.893 --> 51:38.129
I want to bake with...

51:38.163 --> 51:41.266
my little boy
or little girl.

51:44.635 --> 51:46.103
What are you saying?

51:47.672 --> 51:48.573
I'm pregnant.

51:49.774 --> 51:50.908
Yay!

51:52.477 --> 51:53.511
That is so great.

51:53.544 --> 51:54.512
Yeah.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.581
This is amazing.

51:56.614 --> 51:57.615
Really?

51:57.648 --> 51:59.450
Does Roy know?

51:59.484 --> 52:00.585
Of course.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.420
It's like Christmas came early.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.489
I mean, he's already
tossing names around.

52:04.522 --> 52:05.790
But if he thinks that
Duke is an option

52:05.823 --> 52:06.824
for a little boy,

52:06.857 --> 52:07.858
he has another thing coming.

52:09.827 --> 52:11.396
Stephie...

52:11.429 --> 52:15.366
You're gonna have
your own family.

52:16.901 --> 52:18.736
And you're gonna need
your room back.

52:18.769 --> 52:21.339
Oh, don't worry about that.

52:21.372 --> 52:22.473
I mean, plus, you're eyeing
that unit, right?

52:22.507 --> 52:24.242
Yeah.

52:24.275 --> 52:25.476
Yeah.

52:25.510 --> 52:26.611
I mean, we could always
set up a room

52:26.644 --> 52:27.878
in the basement,

52:27.912 --> 52:29.714
and I could use
the full-time babysitter--

52:29.747 --> 52:31.616
You are so funny.

52:31.649 --> 52:32.817
Wow, are you trying to kill me?

52:32.850 --> 52:34.952
I'm so happy!

52:34.985 --> 52:36.587
I'm so happy!

52:36.621 --> 52:38.223
This is--
there's a baby in there.

52:38.256 --> 52:39.190
There's a baby
in there.

52:39.224 --> 52:40.391
Oh, my gosh. Hi!

52:40.425 --> 52:41.692
I'm your auntie!

52:43.494 --> 52:45.230
Daddy, you're home!

52:45.263 --> 52:46.731
Hey, kiddo.
How was your day?

52:46.764 --> 52:48.266
Great.

52:48.299 --> 52:50.235
Did you know the tree
was delivered?

52:50.268 --> 52:51.269
Really?

52:52.570 --> 52:54.405
It's huge,
just like you said.

52:54.439 --> 52:55.506
Yeah?

52:55.540 --> 52:56.507
Well, why don't we
send Caitlin home,

52:56.541 --> 52:57.875
and then set it up.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.710
And decorate it?

52:59.744 --> 53:01.946
Yeah, and decorate it.

53:01.979 --> 53:03.514
Where are the decorations?

53:03.548 --> 53:04.515
That way.

53:04.549 --> 53:05.550
Where?

53:05.583 --> 53:06.617
In the garage?

53:07.952 --> 53:11.356
* Gimme back
the Christmas that I know *

53:11.389 --> 53:14.459
* Hanging up the tree
and mistletoe *

53:14.492 --> 53:17.362
* I'll meet you there

53:17.395 --> 53:19.497
* La-la-la-la...

53:19.530 --> 53:23.568
* Gimme back the yuletide
that I miss *

53:23.601 --> 53:27.238
* Sweep off the dust
from old St. Nick *

53:27.272 --> 53:29.274
* He's got the list

53:29.307 --> 53:31.876
* La-la-la-la...

53:31.909 --> 53:34.679
* All I want for Christmas

53:34.712 --> 53:40.685
* All my people coming home

53:40.718 --> 53:43.721
* All I want for Christmas

53:43.754 --> 53:49.527
* Is the Christmas
that I know *

54:24.729 --> 54:26.464
Okay...

54:28.733 --> 54:30.601
Ta-dah!

54:32.036 --> 54:33.638
They're exactly
what I would have picked out.

54:33.671 --> 54:34.639
Really?

54:34.672 --> 54:36.741
Yes!

54:36.774 --> 54:38.576
I didn't want to get
anything too flashy.

54:38.609 --> 54:39.544
Oh, I'm so glad
you like them.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.011
Yeah, thank you.

54:45.082 --> 54:46.984
How do you do that?

54:47.017 --> 54:48.319
What?

54:49.887 --> 54:52.790
Know what someone wants.

54:52.823 --> 54:54.892
Well, I try to...

54:54.925 --> 54:56.861
kind of read them.

54:56.894 --> 54:58.396
I listen,

54:58.429 --> 55:00.965
try to get a sense
of who they are as a person.

55:00.998 --> 55:04.969
And... who am I?

55:06.804 --> 55:08.906
Who are you?

55:08.939 --> 55:11.709
Charlie Baker.

55:11.742 --> 55:14.412
You're a great guy...

55:16.146 --> 55:19.784
who had something
really horrible happen...

55:21.419 --> 55:23.754
and you threw yourself
into your work.

55:25.022 --> 55:26.491
And I think,
at the end of the day,

55:26.524 --> 55:28.726
you like the simple things

55:28.759 --> 55:31.061
in life.

55:33.097 --> 55:34.432
But that's just...

55:34.465 --> 55:35.933
what I'm sensing.

55:35.966 --> 55:37.802
I could be totally wrong.

55:39.837 --> 55:40.871
Hey.

55:40.905 --> 55:42.907
How are the allergies?

55:42.940 --> 55:44.074
Better.

55:47.011 --> 55:49.680
Listen, I have to go
back to Baltimore

55:49.714 --> 55:51.516
for that meeting.

55:51.549 --> 55:52.517
I thought maybe
you could fly down with me

55:52.550 --> 55:53.518
for a night.

55:53.551 --> 55:54.819
I don't think I can.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.554
I mean,
it's the holidays.

55:56.587 --> 55:58.856
I wouldn't want to leave Owen.

55:58.889 --> 56:00.825
This is why I think you should
get him a nanny.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.827
Then you don't feel
so guilty about leaving him.

56:02.860 --> 56:05.129
That's not it.
I don't want to.

56:05.162 --> 56:06.864
Okay.
If you can't make it,

56:06.897 --> 56:08.766
then, uh, I'll work it.

56:08.799 --> 56:10.000
I know.

56:10.034 --> 56:11.636
You always manage
to work the angles.

56:13.003 --> 56:14.004
Sounds great.

56:14.038 --> 56:15.005
Look forward to it.

56:17.508 --> 56:18.776
All right,
I'm going to head out,

56:18.809 --> 56:20.411
'cause you gotta
get back to work,

56:20.445 --> 56:21.512
but I'm glad
you like the cufflinks.

56:21.546 --> 56:23.080
Actually,
there was one more thing

56:23.113 --> 56:24.114
I was hoping you could
help me with.

56:24.148 --> 56:25.149
Yeah.

56:25.182 --> 56:26.116
What do you need?

56:26.150 --> 56:28.819
A new closet.

56:28.853 --> 56:30.755
Okay, I know I look
very strong,

56:30.788 --> 56:32.790
but I'm a terrible carpenter.

56:32.823 --> 56:36.527
That probably was...
confusing.

56:36.561 --> 56:38.162
No, you want me
to makeover your wardrobe?

56:38.195 --> 56:39.163
Yeah.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.531
Yes!

56:40.565 --> 56:41.566
I'm so good at it.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.501
Not to brag,

56:43.534 --> 56:44.802
but I'm pretty good at that.

56:44.835 --> 56:46.804
Um... when do you
want me to come by?

56:46.837 --> 56:48.172
Maybe after work.

56:48.205 --> 56:49.740
I mean, assuming
you're not too busy.

56:51.141 --> 56:52.877
No, no, I'm...

56:52.910 --> 56:54.712
free, depressingly.

56:55.746 --> 56:56.881
Perfect.

56:56.914 --> 56:57.982
Okay.

56:58.015 --> 57:00.184
I'm gonna go.

57:00.217 --> 57:01.486
But I'll...

57:01.519 --> 57:02.920
Yeah, I'll see you later.

57:02.953 --> 57:04.489
I'm glad you like
the cufflinks.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.232
Oh, nice!

57:15.265 --> 57:16.501
Nice try,
nice try.

57:16.534 --> 57:17.935
Okay, gimme one.
Gimme what you got.

57:17.968 --> 57:19.203
Green 17, say hut!

57:19.236 --> 57:20.871
Go! Go long, go long!

57:22.106 --> 57:23.073
Ooh!

57:23.107 --> 57:24.108
Whoa.

57:24.141 --> 57:25.209
Nice... catch.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.244
Thank you.

57:27.277 --> 57:28.779
Not to brag

57:28.813 --> 57:31.181
but I was a little bit
of a tomboy growing up.

57:31.215 --> 57:32.850
Why does that
not surprise me at all?

57:32.883 --> 57:36.053
Gwen, can you be on my team?

57:36.086 --> 57:38.088
I would-- I would
love to be on your team.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.123
Yeah!

57:39.156 --> 57:41.726
Yeah, come on!

57:44.161 --> 57:45.129
Baker,

57:45.162 --> 57:46.263
you're toast.

57:46.296 --> 57:47.865
Baker, you're toast.

57:50.167 --> 57:51.936
Is that right?

57:51.969 --> 57:52.937
79!

57:52.970 --> 57:54.071
Potato!

57:54.104 --> 57:55.540
Go!

57:55.573 --> 57:57.107
Hut!

58:03.981 --> 58:06.150
I'm watching you, Baker.

58:16.994 --> 58:18.162
No, give it to me!

58:28.806 --> 58:29.707
Are you okay?

58:37.347 --> 58:38.983
I'm sorry.

58:39.016 --> 58:41.218
Other that suits,
this is all I really have.

58:41.251 --> 58:42.219
This is perfect.

58:42.252 --> 58:43.220
Thank you.

58:44.321 --> 58:45.690
Color.

58:45.723 --> 58:46.791
I'm sorry?

58:46.824 --> 58:47.825
That's what you need
for your closet,

58:47.858 --> 58:49.727
for the makeover.

58:51.328 --> 58:53.764
Maybe like
a purple pinstripe?

58:53.798 --> 58:55.933
Exactly.

58:57.301 --> 58:58.803
I'll let you
get cleaned up.

59:17.087 --> 59:18.823
Dad, wait, don't look!

59:18.856 --> 59:19.924
It's your Christmas present.

59:21.125 --> 59:22.693
Don't worry,
I didn't see anything.

59:26.997 --> 59:28.132
Okay, you can look now.

59:28.165 --> 59:29.199
So, what about you,
any Christmas wishes?

59:29.233 --> 59:32.670
Not really.

59:32.703 --> 59:36.040
Are you wishing for
a gaming console,

59:36.073 --> 59:37.374
or some action figures?

59:37.407 --> 59:40.144
What about
another lizard?

59:40.177 --> 59:41.679
Maybe a real one?

59:41.712 --> 59:44.148
Well, there is one thing.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.783
What's that?

59:45.816 --> 59:48.853
A toboggan ride with you.

59:50.054 --> 59:51.856
Did you really
wish for that?

59:57.394 --> 01:00:00.397
Well maybe you should...

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.700
add that
to your wish list.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.301
So I've assessed your closet,

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.037
and I've got my work
cut out for me.

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:10.040
Well, thanks.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.242
Listen, I should
head out,

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.644
but before I go,

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:15.913
Owen...

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.782
I have a little
something for you.

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:25.723
Is it Santa's blanket?

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:28.693
It is Santa's blanket.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.260
I thought it would
be good timing,

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:31.228
'cause it's
almost Christmas

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.329
and you can use it

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:33.163
when you're waiting
up for him, huh?

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:34.198
Thank you.

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:35.199
Do you like it?

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:36.867
- Yes.
- Good!

01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:38.402
It's yours.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:39.436
All right.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.905
I'm gonna head out.

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:43.674
But that was
really fun, Owen.

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:44.709
Thank you, and...

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.410
I'll see you,
Charlie.

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:48.045
Okay.

01:00:49.714 --> 01:00:51.148
Wait!

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:52.817
I made a Christmas card
for you.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:55.786
You did?

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:58.022
Did you make the reindeer?

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.890
Whoa.

01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:00.991
Open it.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:03.327
"Merry Christmas, Gwen."

01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:07.031
This is the greatest
Christmas card

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.032
I've ever gotten.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.399
Thank you.

01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:14.071
You have fun tonight, okay?

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.039
Sleep good.

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:16.473
I'll, um...

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.709
Let me walk you
to your car.

01:01:18.743 --> 01:01:20.077
I'll--
I'll get your coat.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.378
Thanks.

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.013
Let me know when
you want me to come by

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:24.782
and start working
on the closet.

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:28.485
I can bring some photos
and show you a color palette.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.889
Or if you trust me,

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:33.290
you could let me start working

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.893
with what you've got.

01:01:35.926 --> 01:01:39.163
I think I'll just trust you
to work your magic.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.197
Really?

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.067
Well, that's amazing.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.270
So, what does
a personal shopper wish for

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:48.873
for Christmas?

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.875
Or is the list too long?

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:53.377
I can't speak on behalf
of all personal shoppers,

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.879
but what I want for Christmas,

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:56.781
you can't buy at a store.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:58.883
Really?

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.117
No.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:04.354
All I really want
for Christmas is...

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.490
maybe a little snow...

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.961
and just to sit around
and hear some carols.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:13.197
What about you?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.202
I haven't wished for anything
for Christmas

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.503
in a really long time.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:24.842
Until now.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:32.116
What about Victoria?

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:40.057
I'm gonna go.
I... yeah.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.426
This door.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.995
Okay, all right.

01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.963
So, yeah, the closet,

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:46.964
it's gonna be great.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:48.198
I'll... yeah. Bye.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:05.282
* Let every heart...

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:06.416
* Prepare...

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:08.518
Mm, smells good in here.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.931
Hello, Gwen.

01:03:20.965 --> 01:03:22.199
Victoria.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.836
Hi...

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:26.904
What are you doing here?

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:29.406
I'm here to see you.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.541
Me?
You're here to see me?

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:33.277
Can I help you with something?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.246
Actually, you can.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.614
I'm not sure if you're aware,

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:40.250
but it's Charlie's intention
to ask me to marry him,

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.920
and I need you to help him
pick out a ring for me.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:46.190
Oh.

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:48.492
You know,
he never mentioned that.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.127
Oh, that's
probably because

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.395
he was hoping to do it himself,

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:52.496
although I think
it would be better

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:53.864
if you were to guide him,

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:55.299
don't you think?

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.500
Anyway, I can send
you pictures

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.235
of rings
that I like.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:03:59.970
From Tiffany's, of course.

01:04:00.004 --> 01:04:01.571
Simple baguettes,

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.273
nothing under two carats.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:06.410
I'm really sorry
to dampen your plan,

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.478
but Charlie's my client,
not you,

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.515
so unless he specifically
asks me to shop for a ring,

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:14.218
I can't just assume
it's what he wants.

01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:18.322
Trust me.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.590
It's what he wants.

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.426
But I do understand

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:24.929
the whole client-employee
relationship,

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.396
which is what you are,

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:30.234
an employee
of Charlie's.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:33.470
So, thank you for listening.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:42.479
All right,

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.181
I got your favorite,

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.916
chicken lo mein.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:48.518
And I'm the spicy pork.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:51.221
Dad, why don't we ever
go spend Christmas

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.290
at the cabin anymore?

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:54.959
I don't know,

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:56.326
I just haven't been able to get
that much time off work.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.128
It's Christmas.

01:04:58.162 --> 01:04:59.663
You shouldn't be working.

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.331
Hello?
Is anybody home?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.633
Victoria,

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.402
what are you doing here?

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:09.073
I just came to surprise
my two favorite people.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:12.109
What's that?

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:14.044
That is three days

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:15.012
spent on the beach,

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.146
by the ocean,

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.181
for Christmas.

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:19.316
What do you think, Owen?

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:20.417
Doesn't that
sound like fun?

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.519
I can't toboggan at the beach.

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.958
No, but you can swim,

01:05:27.992 --> 01:05:29.960
and, uh, make sand castles.

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:32.329
I don't want to make
sand castles.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:33.697
I want to make a snowman.

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:35.332
Really, Victoria,

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:36.633
I appreciate
the sentiment,

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.336
but maybe we should have
talked about this first.

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:41.071
But then it wouldn't have
been a surprise.

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:44.141
Anyway, I'm sure you'd like to
spend Christmas on the beach.

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.113
Why don't we
discuss this

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:50.247
tomorrow,

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.215
just the two of us,

01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:52.216
over dinner?

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:53.517
Perfect.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.284
I'll have my assistant
make us reservations

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:55.319
at The Loft.

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:02.226
Good night, Owen.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.670
You wanted to see me?

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.105
Come in.

01:06:15.139 --> 01:06:16.073
Come in.

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:22.112
So...

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:23.380
what do you think?

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:24.414
It's perfect.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.649
Owen's going to love it.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:27.251
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:28.318
Yeah, I think so, too.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:29.686
And what's great is

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.755
the salesman said
that it can sit three people.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.461
Then... that's perfect.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.163
Yeah, well, I'm going to
keep it here, obviously,

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.264
so Owen doesn't see it.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:41.765
Right, right.

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:43.667
Is there anything you need
from me last minute?

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.536
You need me buy,
like, um...

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.439
wine or jewelry

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:51.308
for a client, or anyone?

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:53.810
No, I think we've covered
everyone important

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.279
with baskets, and..

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.646
Oh, there is one thing.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.715
A key...

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.084
to my...

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.651
to the house, my house.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:02.619
You know, in case
you want to do

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:03.620
that closet
makeover thing.

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.490
Yeah, I'll get on that tonight.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.592
You're not going to put
a singing Santa in there,

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.660
are you?

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.598
Like that one, yeah.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:16.133
Yeah, you never know
with me, right?

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.468
Always one
for surprises.

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:19.636
Well, as long as it has
your personal touch,

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.471
I'm sure I'll love it.

01:07:23.107 --> 01:07:24.408
I'm going to
work on the closet.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:25.342
I'll talk to you later.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.745
That-- Okay,
'cause I gotta do this thing.

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.780
I gotta go to
this thing anyway, so...

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.290
Oh, the seared octopus
with the tapenade

01:07:40.324 --> 01:07:41.858
is supposed to
be excellent.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.594
I was thinking about the steak.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.132
Can we get two orders
of the octopus?

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.601
What color are my eyes?

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:55.305
Excuse me?

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:56.340
My eyes,

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.741
what color are they?

01:07:57.774 --> 01:07:59.843
I don't know, brown?

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:02.279
They're hazel.

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:06.550
Okay, well,
they look brown to me.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:10.787
What is Owen wishing for
for Christmas?

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.590
Oh, I heard that
all the kids

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:15.325
are really into this
new gaming system,

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:17.594
um, the YKey40.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.229
Right.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:21.665
That octopus was divine.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.201
No wonder Victor Porter
eats there all the time.

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.170
In fact, that would be
a great ice breaker

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.437
for the next time I see him
at the Supper Club.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.772
Hold on one second.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:32.576
Uh, Victor Porter,
grilled octopus, The Loft,

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.542
ice breaker.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.848
I don't think
this is going to work.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.617
Well, do you have
another angle with him?

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:43.819
No, I mean us.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.822
I don't think
this is going to work.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:48.258
Of course, it's going to work.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:49.158
It's going to
more than work.

01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:51.595
Together, we can be
VistaSun's powerhouse.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.662
That's it.

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:55.232
I don't want to be a powerhouse.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:57.634
I want to be a father.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:01.671
I want to be
the kind of father I was...

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:02.839
before.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:05.575
We can work that out.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:08.877
Victoria, I honestly think
this just isn't what you want.

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:11.715
You want a guy
who can just jet off

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.716
to whatever meeting
you have planned next,

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.386
or Christmas
by the beach.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.323
I've realized that's just...

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.890
it's not who I am.

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:25.429
I'm not that guy.

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:28.265
I think that you're making
a really big mistake,

01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:30.200
but if you won't see
the bigger picture,

01:09:30.234 --> 01:09:32.202
then that's
your prerogative.

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:14.911
Gwen?

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:15.945
I'm heading home.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:16.813
Can you lock up for the night?

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.416
Yeah.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.386
Hey, Rhonda,
where did this list come from?

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:23.687
Anna dropped it off.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.788
Said she had meant to give you

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.790
Charlie Baker's
last shopping list.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.492
'Night.

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:26.049
Ow.

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:27.016
God.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:56.513
Mm.

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:19.636
Charlie,
your personal shopper is here.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.570
Send her in.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.373
Mr. Baker. Hi.

01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:25.375
Susan Walker.

01:12:25.409 --> 01:12:26.510
I've been assigned
to be your new stylist.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:29.012
I'm sorry, but...

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:31.781
Gwen's my stylist.

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:33.783
I understand
she was your stylist,

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:34.918
but she asked
to be reassigned.

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.486
I don't understand.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.954
Why?

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:38.988
She thought you might be
a better match

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.023
with someone else.

01:12:44.127 --> 01:12:46.029
Do you think Roy
will like this shirt?

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:48.532
Mm-hmm.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.436
Or maybe I should return it
and buy him a green one.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.103
Yeah. Green's good.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.574
Gwen...

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:58.975
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

01:12:59.008 --> 01:12:59.976
I'm fine.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:01.678
Really?

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.146
Because you told me never
to buy Roy anything green

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:05.114
because it makes him
look pasty.

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:08.985
Okay, the only way you're ever
going to get over Charlie

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:10.820
is with a distraction.

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:12.622
Maybe you should go see...

01:13:12.656 --> 01:13:13.723
David.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.592
David?

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:16.893
The psychologist?

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:18.695
You think I'm going to
see a shrink?

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:19.696
Am I really
that bad?

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.197
No. Like on a date,

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.999
or lunch
or something.

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:24.968
It can't hurt, right?

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:27.136
By the way,

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.473
where did
all my Christmas cookies go?

01:13:29.506 --> 01:13:31.675
I...

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:32.842
really don't know.

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:33.910
Oh, really?

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:36.480
I think Roy ate 'em.

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:38.782
Oh, really? Roy?

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:40.617
Mm-hmm.
He ate them all.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:41.918
Not this cookie monster
right here?

01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:06.543
Daddy, you're home!

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.812
Hey.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:13.016
Yeah, I decided to start
our Christmas holiday early.

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:14.718
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:15.819
Are you going to the beach?

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:17.487
No.

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:20.023
But I have a surprise for you.

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:30.700
Mom?

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:31.735
Gwen!

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:32.936
Oh, sweetheart,

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.071
I'm sorry I missed
all your calls.

01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:36.740
My phone's reception
up here on the mountain

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:38.642
is terrible.

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:40.109
Mountain?

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.878
I thought that you guys
were on a cruise.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:44.013
We were,

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:47.083
and then Carlos had an idea
to climb Machu Pichu.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.152
No, I'll tell you
all about it later,

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:50.687
but while I still have
a signal,

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.255
are you okay?

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:55.158
Yeah, I'm good.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.593
You know what, I'm not, Mom.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.695
I am so confused.

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:01.598
There is something
that I want so badly,

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.767
and I'm not sure
if I should go and get it.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.802
Oh, Gwen.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.804
You're always so good at
making sure

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.673
everyone else is happy.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.175
I mean, look at me.

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:13.843
When your father died,

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.812
you didn't let me wallow,

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.914
and you helped me rise above it.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.282
It is your gift.

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:22.552
But at the same time,
you have to ask yourself,

01:15:22.586 --> 01:15:24.754
what makes you happy?

01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:26.990
And if that thing you want will,

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.927
well, you just go after it.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.128
Ooh!

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:34.564
Darling, I need to go.

01:15:34.598 --> 01:15:36.165
I love you.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.166
Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.768
Merry Christmas, Gwen.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:53.282
All right, let's go, come on.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:55.985
- I'll do it.
- You got it?

01:15:57.253 --> 01:15:58.922
You know what, you were right.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:02.692
It's so much better going out
and finding your own tree.

01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:07.831
Dad, do you think
I will get my wish?

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:09.799
You know,
to go tobogganing?

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:11.701
Well...

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:14.003
Um...

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:15.805
Yeah.

01:16:15.839 --> 01:16:17.607
We'll just have to
wait and see.

01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:18.975
Hey, why don't you
head downstairs

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:21.010
and dig up those
old decorations

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:22.211
so we can get
this thing ready

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.747
for when Santa
comes, huh?

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.649
Okay.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:29.653
Hi.

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:31.354
Hi, Gwen!

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:32.922
It's so nice to see you.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.057
You, too, Pat.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.324
Is-Is Charlie here?

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.293
Oh, I'm sorry, Gwen,

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:38.394
he's already left
for the holidays.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.396
In fact,
he surprised me

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.831
when he said
he was leaving

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:43.266
a few days early.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:45.669
Seems like you really
rubbed off on him.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:51.140
Well, that's just great,
isn't it?

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.746
Merry Christmas, Pat.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.847
Aw, thank you.

01:16:57.881 --> 01:16:59.315
Merry Christmas, Gwen.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:11.795
VistaSun Equities.

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:12.762
Pat?

01:17:12.796 --> 01:17:13.830
It's Charlie.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.264
I've got a serious emergency.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.166
Look, somehow,
I managed to forget

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.002
Owen's toboggan at the office.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.738
Is there any way that
you could have it sent up here?

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.873
I'm sorry, Charlie.

01:17:23.907 --> 01:17:25.775
The couriers won't guarantee
Christmas Day delivery

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:26.943
on Christmas Eve,

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:27.944
and I have a family function.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.079
Can't you
drive down and get it?

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:32.181
No, not without Owen noticing,

01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:35.251
and, besides, I wouldn't be able
to get there and back,

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:36.920
and decorate the tree,

01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:38.688
and Owen would be crushed.

01:17:38.722 --> 01:17:40.156
Don't worry, Charlie.

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:41.691
I'll handle it.

01:17:41.725 --> 01:17:44.393
* Four calling birds
three french hens *

01:17:44.427 --> 01:17:46.029
* Two turtle doves

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:50.066
* And a partridge
in a pear tree... *

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:52.001
* The 12th day of Christmas
my true love-- *

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.104
Hey, Stephie, it's me.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:56.439
Gwen, where are you?

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:59.175
I am just
on my way to Big Bass.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.310
What? Why?

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.012
Charlie forgot
Owen's Christmas present,

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:04.247
and so I'm bringing it to them.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.815
And before you say anything,

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:06.950
I just want you to know

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:08.451
that I'm not just
doing this for him.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:10.787
I'm doing this...

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:13.389
because I feel like
it's what I need. Okay?

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:16.259
Gwen, all I was going to say was
good luck.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:18.294
Oh.

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:19.295
Thanks.

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.130
Okay, well,

01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:22.298
we're just about to take off
to Roy's parents' for Christmas,

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:24.333
so we'll be back later tonight,

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:25.902
but if you're not back in time,

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.203
Merry Christmas, Gwen.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:28.772
I love you.
Merry Christmas.

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:29.806
Merry Christmas.

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:31.040
Hi to Roy's family.

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:36.813
Hey, hon'?

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.147
Three-second rule?

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.149
Don't tell
my mom.

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:42.418
Oh, man. I mean...

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.753
One job!

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.289
What are you doing, Daisy?

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:47.423
No...

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.892
No, no, no, no,
not tonight, Daisy.

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:49.926
Seriously?

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:06.409
Oh, come on.

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:31.935
Stay.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:32.936
Hi.

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:34.003
Hello.

01:19:34.037 --> 01:19:35.471
I am so happy to see you.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.440
What time is your next bus
to Big Bass?

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:38.975
In about three hours.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:40.309
Three hours?

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:41.945
Mm-hmm.
You want a ticket?

01:19:43.046 --> 01:19:44.413
Well, how long is the trip?

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:49.252
Well, you got about five stops
from here to there,

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:50.519
so...

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:51.855
about six hours.

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:53.322
Six hours?

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:55.258
You took the milk route.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.094
Okay, I'll take your six-hour--

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.128
Yeah, let's do it.

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:01.197
Thank you.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.198
Thank you.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:03.166
Good trip.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.576
I didn't realize how many
decorations we had down there.

01:20:13.609 --> 01:20:15.278
Dad, do you think

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.613
Santa will come
and find us here?

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:20.216
Of course.

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:23.186
All those years that
we were here with your mom,

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:25.188
he always knew how to find us.

01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:27.323
Do you think it will snow?

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:32.328
Hey, listen, buddy, um...

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:34.363
I forgot a special
gift for you

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:35.398
at my office.

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:37.300
I'm so sorry.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.502
I don't know
where my head was at.

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.004
That's okay.

01:20:41.037 --> 01:20:44.273
I'm sure Santa will find
a way to get it here.

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:46.409
Yeah, but...

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:47.643
Just in case
he's too busy,

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:51.280
I don't want you to be
too disappointed.

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:53.016
I won't.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.618
Besides, Santa
never disappoints.

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:57.620
Yeah.

01:20:57.653 --> 01:20:59.555
All right, well,
let's get you to bed.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:00.589
I'm sure you're going to
want to be up

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:01.958
bright and early

01:21:01.991 --> 01:21:03.927
to see what
Santa brought you, huh?

01:21:11.034 --> 01:21:15.138
Bus 34B to Big Bass
is ready for boarding!

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:16.639
Ho-ho-ho!

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:10.026
Merry Christmas, okay?

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:11.660
Get home safe!

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:21.337
Gwen?

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:25.008
Y-you're...

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:26.976
you're here.

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:29.045
Hi.

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:31.114
Yeah, I just...

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:33.516
I wanted to
make sure Owen had

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.384
his special Christmas wish.

01:22:35.418 --> 01:22:38.354
Oh, it looks horrible.

01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:40.423
That looks terrible now.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.125
No, no, no,
it's fine, really.

01:22:42.158 --> 01:22:43.392
No, it does.
No, the bow was--

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:44.760
- No, no, no, this--
- It was very pretty--

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:47.063
It's fine, really, no.

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.065
Thank you.

01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:51.567
I... I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:55.304
Well, that's why I did it.

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.278
Okay, so you guys have...

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.147
You know, this is great,
this is beautiful.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.114
I'm gonna head out.

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.449
Um...

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:08.417
I like that sweater, actually,
surprisingly.

01:23:08.451 --> 01:23:09.618
It looks great.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.187
I'm gonna go, but
I'll see you later.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:12.221
How?

01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:13.222
Hmm? What?

01:23:13.256 --> 01:23:14.290
I mean, how?

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.059
Your ride's gone.

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.467
Can I borrow your phone?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.335
'Cause mine's been dead
for a long time,

01:23:26.369 --> 01:23:28.171
and...

01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:29.405
it'll be fast.

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:30.606
I can even call
a car service--

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:31.607
Of course, of course, yeah, no.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.775
But why don't you stay?

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:34.477
I mean, it's Christmas,
after all,

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:35.644
and you came
all this way,

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.313
and...

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:40.549
and... I got something for you.

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:45.688
Come in.

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.526
It's so cozy in here.

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:58.234
Your tree is perfect.

01:23:58.267 --> 01:23:59.502
Wow...

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:02.405
Well done.

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:05.841
Here.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.743
This is for you.

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:08.777
Really?

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:11.314
Yeah, go ahead, open it.

01:24:11.347 --> 01:24:12.715
Okay.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.325
I love this.

01:24:22.358 --> 01:24:23.759
It's everything you wished for.

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:26.495
Snow...

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:28.397
and sparkling lights,

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:31.300
and it even sings a carol.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.437
You remembered.

01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:37.440
I love it.

01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:40.409
Thank you.

01:24:40.443 --> 01:24:41.777
Why did you
drop me?

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:43.479
As a client?

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:47.283
I didn't know
what was happening

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:48.784
with you and Victoria,

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:52.188
and I didn't want to
get in the way,

01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:54.457
if you were shopping for a ring.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:59.662
I don't think
you should be with her, Charlie.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:02.198
I'm sorry if
I shouldn't say that.

01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:04.333
I just don't think
that she's right for you.

01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:06.602
She's cold,
and you are so...

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:08.204
not like that--

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:09.638
You're right.

01:25:11.907 --> 01:25:13.242
You're right.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:15.911
I am?

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.380
Yeah.

01:25:17.413 --> 01:25:19.482
It's what I thought I needed,

01:25:19.515 --> 01:25:20.916
my work,

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.785
and Victoria,

01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:24.453
and then you came along, and...

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:30.259
it changed everything.

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.661
You... changed everything.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:35.231
I-I did?

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:38.634
Well...

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:40.636
I mean, that's my job

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:41.937
as a personal shopper.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.706
I come into people's lives,

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:45.408
and clients of mine,

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:46.642
you know, they--
yeah, they--

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:01.924
Owen!

01:26:01.957 --> 01:26:03.559
Hi!

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.861
Hey, buddy.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.297
Gwen brought you
your special gift.

01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:11.700
See, I told you
Santa would find a way.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.670
Okay, come here, you.

01:26:18.341 --> 01:26:20.309
Your Christmas card.

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:23.412
: Did you make that?

01:26:23.446 --> 01:26:24.480
: It's the three of us.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:25.381
-: Is that me?
-: Yes.

01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:27.750
: Look outside.

01:26:29.452 --> 01:26:31.687
Guys, it's snowing.

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:34.823
Wow.

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:36.792
How beautiful is that?

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.728
Oh, my gosh.

01:26:39.762 --> 01:26:41.797
Looks like everybody
got their wish..

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:44.667
They sure did.
