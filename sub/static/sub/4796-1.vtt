Have a nice day.

00:34.138 --> 00:35.730
Next in line, please.

00:38.209 --> 00:41.007
Ooh, a week in Hawaii.
l'll fill in for you.

00:41.045 --> 00:42.239
Are you sure?

00:42.280 --> 00:46.182
You just take your honeymoon
before l change my mind.

00:46.217 --> 00:48.186
-Thank you.
-There you go, sir.

00:48.220 --> 00:50.745
-Thank you very much.
-Have a nice day, sir.

00:53.726 --> 00:55.125
Next in line, please.

01:07.072 --> 01:09.472
Hey, Darnell. l didn't know
you had an account here.

01:10.976 --> 01:14.070
As a matter of fact, l never
saw you out of the projects.

01:14.113 --> 01:17.344
Shut the fuck up
and empty the fucking drawer!

01:17.383 --> 01:19.351
Empty the drawer!

01:19.385 --> 01:20.977
Next in line, please.

01:22.055 --> 01:24.023
Come on, Darnell.

01:24.057 --> 01:26.992
Darnell, don't do this.

01:28.928 --> 01:31.556
Now come on. Stop, please.

01:31.598 --> 01:34.226
Why are you playing?
lt's not a fucking game.

01:34.267 --> 01:35.666
Empty the fucking drawer!

01:35.702 --> 01:40.162
Hell, no.
l want nothing to do with this.

01:48.948 --> 01:50.415
Everyone get on
the fucking floor now!

01:50.450 --> 01:52.008
Get the fuck on the floor!

01:53.653 --> 01:55.917
Give me the money!

01:55.955 --> 01:58.220
Come on.
Let's get this money, baby!

01:58.259 --> 02:00.523
-Now!
-Get your ass on the floor.

02:00.561 --> 02:02.791
Give him the money.

02:03.898 --> 02:05.729
Lay your ass down! Stay there!

02:05.766 --> 02:07.028
Hurry up!

02:21.248 --> 02:23.239
Fill it up!

02:23.284 --> 02:24.444
Give him the money!

02:25.753 --> 02:27.084
Give him the money, bitch!

02:27.121 --> 02:28.520
And hurry up, God damn it!

02:28.556 --> 02:30.353
l said, hurry up!

02:32.260 --> 02:33.659
Give us everything
in the drawer.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.095
Oh, my God!

02:36.131 --> 02:38.190
-Don't cry now.
-Hurry it up!

02:39.267 --> 02:40.666
Here. Here. Take it.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.966
lt's yours. Go! Go! Go!

02:43.004 --> 02:44.369
Shit.

02:56.852 --> 02:58.717
Oh, my God!

03:08.331 --> 03:09.958
Come on, man!

03:18.674 --> 03:19.868
Everybody stay down!

03:40.731 --> 03:41.891
ls everyone OK?

04:05.956 --> 04:08.686
Why don't we take it
from the top?

04:08.725 --> 04:09.851
l thought we covered everything.

04:09.893 --> 04:12.828
How well did you know
the perpetrator?

04:12.863 --> 04:15.833
l've just known Darnell
from around the way is all.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.130
We live in the same projects.

04:18.168 --> 04:19.863
Frankie, will you do me a favor?

04:19.904 --> 04:22.498
Just tell me one thing,
and we'll get out of here.

04:24.776 --> 04:26.004
Sure.

04:26.044 --> 04:27.978
What's the procedure
when you're being robbed?

04:29.380 --> 04:30.574
Look, sir--

04:30.615 --> 04:32.310
Stop! Stop! Stop!

04:32.350 --> 04:33.510
Now...

04:34.752 --> 04:38.210
what's the procedure
when you're being robbed?

04:43.228 --> 04:47.892
You pull the money clip
from your right-hand drawer...

04:47.932 --> 04:50.697
and then you signal
with the left hand.

04:50.736 --> 04:52.567
You signal with the left.

04:52.605 --> 04:54.732
So you know the procedure.

04:54.773 --> 04:58.539
Yes. The procedure has been
told to me over a million times.

04:58.577 --> 04:59.737
So why is it...

05:00.779 --> 05:03.577
if that procedure's
been drummed into your head...

05:03.616 --> 05:07.643
a million times--
you got that procedure down--

05:07.686 --> 05:09.017
why wouldn't you follow it?

05:11.056 --> 05:13.047
Because he had a gun!

05:14.526 --> 05:17.188
And l went for my clip,
but he shot her.

05:19.031 --> 05:20.862
He shot her
right in front of me.

05:23.435 --> 05:26.166
l'm afraid we're going
to have to let you go.

05:26.206 --> 05:29.107
That you knew the perpetrator
doesn't sit well with us.

05:29.142 --> 05:31.167
Wait. But that's not right.

05:31.211 --> 05:33.509
l haven't done anything wrong!

05:33.546 --> 05:36.014
l can't help who l know!

05:36.049 --> 05:39.678
Mr. Zachary, just last week,
you gave me a promotion...

05:39.719 --> 05:41.687
and now you're going
to take my job away?

05:41.721 --> 05:44.087
What happens the next time one
of your friends robs the bank?

05:44.124 --> 05:46.718
How do we know
you're not in collusion?

05:46.760 --> 05:50.491
Collusion?
Let me tell you something--

05:50.530 --> 05:53.021
l am here at 2:20 sharp
every morning...

05:53.066 --> 05:56.297
and l work my ass off
until quitting time.

05:56.336 --> 06:01.070
Yesterday, l counted
$240,000 by hand for you!

06:02.243 --> 06:03.835
That's how you should know!

06:03.878 --> 06:06.369
l mean...

06:06.414 --> 06:09.542
come on!
This is just not right!

06:09.583 --> 06:13.815
l nearly got blown away in
your tight-ass fucking bank...

06:13.854 --> 06:15.822
and you're going to fire me?

06:15.856 --> 06:18.689
-Calm down.
-You couldn't even wait!

06:29.036 --> 06:32.199
You didn't even bother to ask me
if l was thirsty, sister.

06:35.377 --> 06:37.868
She's involved. l want
everything you have on her.

07:33.436 --> 07:37.770
l thought l said
a Seventies graduation party.

07:37.807 --> 07:40.139
Seventies, Halloween.
What's the difference?

07:41.244 --> 07:42.802
You're the only one
in the neighborhood...

07:42.845 --> 07:44.837
to give a Seventies
graduation party.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.350
Anyway, T.T., Jajuan...

07:47.384 --> 07:49.011
y'all look
awfully groovy tonight.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.519
You like it, girl?

07:50.554 --> 07:53.022
Thank you
for following directions.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.887
Simple directions.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.855
Look at him. Ain't he fine?

07:58.896 --> 08:01.126
Just as handsome
as he wants to be.

08:01.165 --> 08:02.291
l know it.

08:02.332 --> 08:04.095
Can you believe
he's going to college?

08:05.135 --> 08:08.627
Man, l remember when
you was just a little scrub...

08:08.672 --> 08:12.301
always trying
to follow us around and shit.

08:12.342 --> 08:14.435
On that tricycle.

08:14.478 --> 08:16.844
Y'all always trying
to mess up somebody's game.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.405
Please.

08:18.450 --> 08:20.315
What game?

08:20.351 --> 08:22.342
Whatever.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.317
Stony,
you got a ten l can borrow?

08:26.357 --> 08:28.120
We need some more chips.
Stuff running out.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.353
Come on, college boy.

08:29.394 --> 08:32.124
You're the one that's
going to be making all the loot.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.222
You have to stop
spoiling that boy.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.927
You've been taking care of him
since your mama and daddy died.

08:51.516 --> 08:52.642
What you got?

08:52.684 --> 08:54.312
You ain't drinking
none of this shit.

09:03.429 --> 09:05.363
Stevie, what's the problem?

09:12.505 --> 09:14.132
l'm not going.

09:15.608 --> 09:16.973
l ain't going to college.

09:17.009 --> 09:19.807
What? All right, look.

09:19.845 --> 09:23.110
Don't start tripping, OK?
You cannot change your mind.

09:23.148 --> 09:25.639
We got into UCLA,
and that's where we're going.

09:25.684 --> 09:28.381
l ain't changed my mind.
l didn't get a scholarship.

09:29.723 --> 09:31.247
They didn't give you
a scholarship?

09:32.826 --> 09:34.817
But we told them
the only way we could apply--

09:34.861 --> 09:36.351
l know.

09:44.237 --> 09:46.000
All right.
Well, don't worry about it.

09:46.039 --> 09:47.370
l'll take care of it.

09:48.341 --> 09:51.003
lt's probably just because
l'm a January graduate.

09:51.044 --> 09:52.204
How are you going
to take care of it?

09:52.245 --> 09:54.304
You can barely pay the bills
around here.

09:55.882 --> 09:58.180
l'll just get a job.
l'll help around here until--

09:58.218 --> 10:02.314
No. Wrong. We're going
to stick to the plan...

10:02.355 --> 10:04.517
and we are definitely
getting you up out of here.

10:17.572 --> 10:19.199
l ain't hearing what this fool--

10:19.240 --> 10:21.731
Good afternoon, ladies...

10:23.244 --> 10:25.212
and gentlemen.

10:26.247 --> 10:28.977
All right. Listen up.

10:30.484 --> 10:35.581
Now, these good white folks
are trying to recycle...

10:35.623 --> 10:38.821
all of their glasses,
plastics, and aluminum...

10:39.628 --> 10:42.893
and you bitches putting
all the shit in the dumpsters.

10:42.931 --> 10:45.866
You gots to recycle.

10:45.901 --> 10:48.199
Who had 104?

10:49.871 --> 10:51.998
l did.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.406
You didn't
empty the cans in 104.

10:54.443 --> 10:55.910
l'm docking your pay.

10:55.944 --> 10:57.275
That ain't right.

10:57.312 --> 10:58.438
Who are you supposed to be?

10:58.480 --> 11:02.177
Goddamn Mighty Morphin
fucking Power Ranger?

11:02.217 --> 11:05.118
What you going to do?
l'm docking her pay!

11:06.188 --> 11:09.214
Speaking of pay,
l thought you said...

11:09.257 --> 11:12.523
that you was going to pay me
under the table.

11:12.562 --> 11:14.792
They're taking taxes
out of my check.

11:14.831 --> 11:17.163
l don't even got enough money
to pay for my baby-sitter.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.361
On this good earth...

11:19.402 --> 11:22.371
there are three peoples
l don't mess with...

11:22.405 --> 11:25.374
the ''l,'' the ''R,'' and the ''S.''

11:25.408 --> 11:27.035
But l got my baby-sitter!

11:27.076 --> 11:32.378
lf you don't like working
for Luther's Janitorial...

11:32.415 --> 11:35.543
why don't you just take
your broke ass home?

11:35.585 --> 11:40.215
Otherwise, shut the fuck up
and get back to work!

11:40.256 --> 11:43.157
You one cold-hearted
motherfucker, Luther.

11:43.192 --> 11:44.716
Get back to work.

11:44.761 --> 11:46.251
You didn't have
to talk to her like that!

11:48.832 --> 11:51.562
Tisean, you have got to learn
to stand up for yourself.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.233
Did y'all hear
what happened to Frankie?

11:55.272 --> 11:57.467
Our Frankie?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.408
Lorenz and them robbed a bank.

11:59.443 --> 12:01.877
This kid's got 211s
in four cities.

12:01.912 --> 12:04.346
He's wanted
in Nevada, Arizona...

12:04.381 --> 12:08.078
He's damn near professional.
What's he, twenty-one?

12:08.118 --> 12:11.212
-They're getting younger.
-Yeah?

12:11.255 --> 12:13.189
l want everything you got
on his young ass--

12:13.223 --> 12:16.818
where he hangs out,
who he knows, where mom lives.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.487
Everything. l want it all.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.554
Look at that. Check that out.

12:20.597 --> 12:23.863
His hair. What is that?

12:23.902 --> 12:26.769
''A...P''?

12:27.539 --> 12:28.699
What's that, a nickname?

12:30.141 --> 12:31.301
''Asshole, perhaps''?

12:34.746 --> 12:36.577
Oh, fuck off.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.331
Cleo...

12:57.369 --> 12:59.269
when you gonna fix
this raggedy shit?

12:59.305 --> 13:01.205
Never mind my shit, fool.

13:03.175 --> 13:05.370
Frankie, l heard what happened
at the bank the other day.

13:05.411 --> 13:06.571
Keep your head up, girl,
all right?

13:08.314 --> 13:10.680
Up. Up.

13:12.785 --> 13:14.377
Watch this motherfucker.

13:19.658 --> 13:22.058
That's all right.
Your shit is original.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.153
Damn right.

13:24.196 --> 13:25.959
Don't worry,
my shit is going to be tight.

13:25.998 --> 13:28.990
Cleo, you've been fixing up
this car since seventh grade.

13:31.505 --> 13:34.201
Do you know Lorenz and them
got away with twenty grand?

13:34.241 --> 13:36.038
Twenty? Jeez. Damn.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.476
See, that's what the fuck
we need to do--

13:38.512 --> 13:39.979
rob a bank.

13:41.481 --> 13:42.607
No. That's crazy.

13:42.649 --> 13:46.085
Really, though. The four of us
could take a bank.

13:47.487 --> 13:50.786
lf that crackhead Darnell
can rob a bank, we can.

13:50.824 --> 13:52.485
Twenty Gs
would save my life right now.

13:52.526 --> 13:55.393
Stevie needs tuition.

13:55.428 --> 13:58.397
Well, too bad
we ain't some hard-up...

13:58.431 --> 14:01.662
crackhead motherfuckers
like Lorenz and them.

14:01.701 --> 14:05.501
Then we could do some
suicidal shit like rob a bank.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.509
But we ain't crazy, so we can't.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.534
So now you making the rules?

14:10.578 --> 14:13.012
Frankie, please!

14:13.047 --> 14:14.810
Ain't nobody over here
going to be robbing no bank.

14:14.849 --> 14:19.218
You're right.
We ain't going to rob no bank.

14:19.253 --> 14:22.484
Let's just go in there
and blow it the fuck up!

14:24.392 --> 14:26.053
Here you go.

14:26.093 --> 14:29.221
Can you believe after working
at that bank for two years...

14:30.665 --> 14:33.463
l can't get a recommendation
for another job?

14:33.501 --> 14:34.934
All right, l'm going
to hook you up with Luther.

14:35.736 --> 14:38.227
l know you ain't happy,
but you need a job.

14:38.272 --> 14:40.503
Ursula, come here.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.407
How you doing, Ursula?

14:45.614 --> 14:47.582
What's up?

14:50.085 --> 14:52.417
What the fuck is up with that?
She don't talk?

14:52.454 --> 14:54.217
Not really.

14:59.561 --> 15:02.325
Girl, next time l page you,
you better be calling me back.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.525
Excuse me. Drink, please.

15:07.569 --> 15:11.005
What's up, girl?
That's a cute outfit.

15:11.039 --> 15:13.098
Want some?

15:15.879 --> 15:18.541
Hey, Stony, look, girl.

15:18.581 --> 15:20.105
There's Nate Andrews.

15:24.721 --> 15:28.521
Girl, didn't he want you
to work in his car lot for him?

15:28.558 --> 15:31.220
Yes, and that's not all
he wanted.

15:36.399 --> 15:38.060
You going over there?

15:42.372 --> 15:44.067
Yeah. l'm going to see
what he wants.

15:56.287 --> 15:59.552
So how much money could
l make selling cars for you?

15:59.590 --> 16:02.650
Well, it depends.
l mean, you can make...

16:02.693 --> 16:04.490
two Gs a month on commission.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.224
-That much?
-Yeah!

16:07.264 --> 16:10.427
l told you you needed to get
somebody who could help you.

16:10.467 --> 16:13.300
Nate,
before l come work for you...

16:14.538 --> 16:16.472
l need an advance.

16:17.841 --> 16:20.002
There's a little problem
that l need to fix.

16:22.179 --> 16:23.737
Oh! l can do that.

16:26.217 --> 16:30.950
But l mean, Stony Newsome...

16:30.989 --> 16:33.014
you got to give me
a reason to do that.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.685
You know what l mean?

16:34.726 --> 16:36.421
What would that be?

16:36.461 --> 16:38.486
Come on, now. You know.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.498
Let's go for a ride, huh?

17:02.421 --> 17:03.854
So when do l get my advance?

17:03.889 --> 17:08.326
l don't know.
Tomorrow. Maybe the day after.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.853
Nate, before l do this,
l want my check.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.763
Whoa. Look, you're not getting
no check from me...

17:14.800 --> 17:16.733
until l'm done, you understand?

17:16.769 --> 17:19.464
This ain't right.
lt's not even worth it.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.200
Shit.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.219
l'm in a bind, Nate.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.085
Some other time.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.794
l really need this money, Nate.

19:03.679 --> 19:05.704
What the fuck is that?

19:05.747 --> 19:07.908
lt's Frankie.
lt's her first night.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.009
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

19:12.121 --> 19:13.611
Look at this motherfucker.

19:14.790 --> 19:17.190
Bet you he ain't never
held a broom in his life...

19:18.061 --> 19:21.428
and she ain't did no dishes
or washed no clothes.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.932
This is a ugly-ass baby!

19:23.967 --> 19:27.994
You know, white people be
having some old water head...

19:28.037 --> 19:30.972
crying-ass, ugly babies.

19:31.007 --> 19:33.532
l can't unload these things
without dropping them.

19:33.576 --> 19:34.770
Frankie, relax!

19:34.811 --> 19:37.177
How can you stand
the smell of this garbage?

19:37.213 --> 19:40.182
-The shit ain't that bad.
-Ain't that bad?

19:40.216 --> 19:41.911
Cleo, you live in a garage!

19:41.951 --> 19:43.543
Girl, it'll be OK.

19:43.586 --> 19:46.384
And you--stay out of it.

19:52.695 --> 19:55.062
Damn. Look at my nails!

19:55.099 --> 19:57.795
Shit, girl,
you been bitchin' all night.

19:59.470 --> 20:02.462
Stony back there
acting all stank-a-dank-dank.

20:04.508 --> 20:07.909
That's all right.
l got something for that here.

20:11.916 --> 20:14.407
Ow, girl! That hurt.

20:18.656 --> 20:21.022
That's the only way
you get the knot out.

20:21.058 --> 20:23.652
Yep. l rolled this one good.

20:24.528 --> 20:26.428
Blunt talking to me,
motherfucker.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.757
Stop it, girl. Stinky.

20:30.802 --> 20:32.201
There.

20:36.908 --> 20:39.274
Cleo, l done told you
l'm strictly dickly.

20:39.311 --> 20:41.176
l'm going to tell Ursula.

20:41.213 --> 20:43.181
You're going to tell nobody.

20:45.517 --> 20:47.951
Check out Stony.
Look at her. Look at her.

20:49.187 --> 20:52.088
Chronic always get her ass
all quiet.

20:52.123 --> 20:54.421
Look at her sitting over there.

20:54.459 --> 20:56.359
Hey, you fucked up,
ain't you, girl?

21:03.569 --> 21:05.059
What?

21:06.239 --> 21:07.729
What's wrong with them?

21:10.910 --> 21:13.037
You know.
Every time we get high...

21:13.079 --> 21:15.445
you start looking
like Sugar Bear.

21:15.481 --> 21:16.778
For real.

21:18.751 --> 21:20.218
Y'all cold.

21:20.253 --> 21:22.118
You do kind of look like
Sugar Bear.

21:22.154 --> 21:24.122
Fuck all y'all.

21:25.958 --> 21:28.290
Simple bitches.

21:28.327 --> 21:30.818
Cleo, don't get salty.

21:36.102 --> 21:37.900
Damn.

21:37.938 --> 21:40.168
Before they started
laying people off...

21:40.207 --> 21:43.734
they was paying folks fifteen
dollars an hour at that place.

21:43.777 --> 21:46.337
Man. That's good money!

21:47.948 --> 21:50.178
For fifteen dollars an hour,
l'd be all...

21:50.217 --> 21:52.082
''Fuck, l'm right here.

21:52.119 --> 21:54.451
''What l gotta do,
Sir Ass Motherfucker?''

21:56.456 --> 21:59.425
They'd have to pull me off
that damn machine.

21:59.459 --> 22:00.790
Shit.

22:00.827 --> 22:04.194
That overtime would be
twenty-two fifty an hour!

22:04.231 --> 22:06.529
l don't know
what l'm going to do.

22:06.566 --> 22:09.364
Now that Luther's
taking taxes out of my check...

22:09.403 --> 22:12.396
l'm making half as much
as l used to.

22:14.909 --> 22:17.776
Only way we going to see cash
is we take a bank.

22:17.812 --> 22:19.803
Now, see, l'm with that shit.

22:19.847 --> 22:22.315
Y'all niggers
done lost your mind.

22:22.350 --> 22:24.284
We might as well not even talk
about this shit no more.

22:24.319 --> 22:26.219
l'm talking about it.

22:26.254 --> 22:28.984
Ain't nobody going to stop me
from talking about it.

22:29.023 --> 22:31.719
Well, talk is cheap...

22:35.830 --> 22:36.990
nigger.

22:40.768 --> 22:43.566
Wait. l mean, you know?

22:43.604 --> 22:46.072
Frankie,
you gonna get slapped.

22:46.107 --> 22:47.598
What?

22:47.643 --> 22:49.736
You always talking shit.

22:49.778 --> 22:52.747
You want to blow the bank up,
now you want to rob it.

22:52.781 --> 22:55.545
Frankie want to blow up the bank

22:55.584 --> 22:57.484
Frankie want to rob the bank

23:02.624 --> 23:04.216
l ain't heard nothing
about that.

23:08.230 --> 23:11.859
l said, hang up the phone.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.094
You know who that is.

23:13.135 --> 23:14.693
Yeah. l gotta go. l'll be over.

23:14.737 --> 23:17.763
Don't drink up
my champagne, man. Peace.

23:17.806 --> 23:18.966
Champagne?

23:19.742 --> 23:21.802
Whatever. l ain't got time.

23:21.845 --> 23:25.713
Look! Did your sister
come through for you or what?

23:25.749 --> 23:27.546
-Where'd you get this?
-Don't worry about it.

23:27.584 --> 23:30.280
Ain't none of your business.
Just look at the digits.

23:34.424 --> 23:35.721
Stony, there's something
l got to tell you.

23:35.759 --> 23:37.886
Look, l know
this is hardly enough money...

23:37.927 --> 23:39.554
but l will get every--

23:39.596 --> 23:41.325
No. Listen to me.

23:42.565 --> 23:45.295
l didn't get into UCLA...

23:45.335 --> 23:48.862
and l'm not going
because l didn't get accepted.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.399
You didn't get in?

23:54.444 --> 23:55.912
Don't go off on me now.

23:55.946 --> 23:58.506
Don't you tell me
not to go off on you!

23:59.750 --> 24:03.550
Do you have any idea
what l had to go through?

24:03.587 --> 24:05.248
Do you?

24:05.956 --> 24:07.389
l'm not staying around for this.

24:07.425 --> 24:09.916
You are going to hang around
for this, so don't move.

24:15.766 --> 24:17.893
Why did you have to lie to me?

24:17.935 --> 24:19.800
Stony, you know
how long you told me...

24:19.837 --> 24:22.135
that l had to go to college?

24:22.173 --> 24:26.200
Well, l'm sorry, but maybe
that life is just not for me.

24:37.589 --> 24:39.181
Shit.

24:54.272 --> 24:55.762
Who is it?

24:55.807 --> 24:57.604
Lorenz, it's Stevie, man.

24:58.844 --> 25:00.277
Come on. Open up, man.

25:03.281 --> 25:05.044
Hey, Lorenz, chill, man.

25:09.288 --> 25:11.848
Hey, l heard you robbed a bank.

25:11.891 --> 25:13.722
l didn't rob no bank.

25:14.827 --> 25:16.727
l heard your party
was awful good.

25:19.432 --> 25:22.401
You know why l didn't come.
Your sister don't like me.

25:22.435 --> 25:23.925
She be trippin'.

25:25.137 --> 25:26.331
Nah, she cool, man.

25:26.372 --> 25:27.999
To let you tell it.

25:32.645 --> 25:35.341
Here, Mr. UCLA.

25:35.381 --> 25:36.905
Here.

25:38.251 --> 25:39.411
You all right?

25:40.287 --> 25:43.120
-Yeah. l'm straight, man.
-All right.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.251
Hey, that ''AP'' is phat.

25:50.197 --> 25:52.722
''Acorn Projects.''
Man, l thought you knew!

25:52.766 --> 25:54.631
Oh, well...

25:55.802 --> 25:58.327
You want this?

25:58.372 --> 26:00.772
No, man. l'm straight. No.

26:00.807 --> 26:02.672
You know your sister
whup your ass.

26:02.709 --> 26:05.143
My sister
ain't gonna do nothing.

26:06.179 --> 26:08.409
Tamika, hook him up.

26:08.448 --> 26:10.245
He ain't from Acorn.

26:10.284 --> 26:12.445
Fuck all that.

26:12.486 --> 26:15.115
Get the clippers,
hook his ass up.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.556
Take your ass in the kitchen
with your raggly ass.

26:17.592 --> 26:18.889
You talk too much.

26:19.794 --> 26:21.352
Come on!

26:21.396 --> 26:23.557
Ain't nothing funny, man.
Go on. You, too.

26:36.077 --> 26:38.545
All right, man.

26:38.580 --> 26:40.912
Cool. Thanks for the champagne.

27:01.503 --> 27:02.629
Freeze!

27:02.671 --> 27:04.639
Get down on the ground!
Get down now!

27:17.219 --> 27:19.187
Get him down! Get him down!

27:19.221 --> 27:21.348
Get down!

27:23.826 --> 27:25.419
-He's got a gun!
-Wait!

27:41.811 --> 27:44.041
-Waller!
-Check apartment ''L'' now!

27:44.080 --> 27:46.981
Get me an ambulance!
Get me a medic!

27:47.017 --> 27:50.043
-He's up there!
-Get me an ambulance now!

27:50.086 --> 27:51.485
Come on, God damn it!
Stay with me here!

27:53.890 --> 27:56.484
Get me a fucking ambulance!

28:09.206 --> 28:11.697
A fucking champagne bottle.

28:11.742 --> 28:13.266
Open that, quick.

28:16.714 --> 28:18.739
Get down!

28:18.783 --> 28:21.411
Shit! l didn't do nothing!

28:45.277 --> 28:47.768
Goddamn pigs!
What you fucking with me for?

28:49.681 --> 28:52.411
-Man down!
-We've got it covered!

28:52.451 --> 28:55.011
-Get in here!
-Go, go!

29:36.062 --> 29:38.292
God, no!

29:42.869 --> 29:45.270
What have you done?

30:03.090 --> 30:04.387
Excuse me.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.421
This motherfucker.

30:10.731 --> 30:13.131
lf you need to talk,
if you have any questions...

30:13.167 --> 30:14.498
l hope
you won't hesitate to call.

30:16.303 --> 30:17.999
There will be
a full investigation.

30:19.941 --> 30:22.967
-No!
-All right. OK.

30:23.011 --> 30:26.174
Fuck you!
Fuck your investigation!

30:31.853 --> 30:33.548
What have you got?

30:33.588 --> 30:35.749
Stevie Newsome. No priors.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.985
Good student.
Headed for college, l hear.

30:38.026 --> 30:41.086
Both parents killed in
a car accident four years ago.

30:41.129 --> 30:42.528
God damn it.

30:55.644 --> 30:57.077
We can do this.

30:57.112 --> 31:00.445
We can get some wigs,
some sunglasses, and it's on.

31:00.482 --> 31:02.177
Y'all gonna have to do this
without me.

31:03.452 --> 31:06.785
l keep thinking about Darnell
getting killed and Lorenz shot.

31:07.790 --> 31:10.884
That's because Darnell and them
were a bunch of damn fools.

31:10.926 --> 31:12.985
They don't know half
of what l know about banks.

31:14.029 --> 31:16.497
What if something goes wrong?
What if somebody gets hurt?

31:16.532 --> 31:19.399
Listen to me.
You're just scared, baby.

31:19.435 --> 31:20.663
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

31:21.704 --> 31:23.763
That's why
this is the perfect crime.

31:23.806 --> 31:25.205
l know this too well.

31:25.241 --> 31:27.106
What about
all them folks' money?

31:27.142 --> 31:30.271
-lnsurance.
-Dumb-ass comment.

31:30.313 --> 31:33.578
Look, we're just taking
away from the system...

31:33.617 --> 31:36.415
that's fucking us all anyway.

31:36.453 --> 31:38.444
You know?

31:41.324 --> 31:42.689
Let's do it.

32:02.079 --> 32:03.637
Excuse me.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.543
How can l help you
today, Miss...?

32:40.118 --> 32:41.517
Dorsey.

32:43.455 --> 32:45.855
l'd like to open up
a new account.

32:48.694 --> 32:50.525
Right this way.

32:50.562 --> 32:52.496
You can open up an interest-
bearing checking account...

32:52.531 --> 32:54.431
with a thousand dollar deposit,
if you like.

32:54.466 --> 32:56.559
-lt's up to you.
-A thousand dollars?

32:59.271 --> 33:01.535
Do you have long lines?

33:01.573 --> 33:06.203
Not too bad. We usually operate
with about fourteen tellers.

33:08.780 --> 33:12.148
Actually, l'm a manager
in corporate banking upstairs.

33:12.185 --> 33:13.777
l don't know what
these folks do down here...

33:13.820 --> 33:15.811
but when l saw you,
l said to myself...

33:15.855 --> 33:18.915
''Self, a woman that fine--''

33:18.958 --> 33:21.893
As fine as you are,
and you are that fine--

33:21.928 --> 33:24.624
''Needs to have
her own personal banker.''

33:24.664 --> 33:26.359
So l couldn't help myself.

33:28.935 --> 33:31.130
She smiles. Come on, now.

33:34.474 --> 33:35.964
Ms. Dorsey, l'm new in town...

33:36.009 --> 33:37.909
and l swear to you,
l don't do this all the time.

33:37.944 --> 33:39.741
l know you don't know me
from Adam.

33:39.779 --> 33:42.976
l don't know
what your plans are tonight...

33:43.016 --> 33:45.041
Do you have plans tonight?

33:45.084 --> 33:48.145
-Are you asking me out?
-Maybe.

33:49.323 --> 33:54.454
Keith, well, l see
you're in new accounts now.

33:54.495 --> 33:56.963
Nigel, thank you. Thank you
for your observation there.

33:58.232 --> 34:00.223
These people
are going to kill me.

34:00.267 --> 34:02.167
Now, can l have your number?

34:10.643 --> 34:12.543
But l'll take yours.

34:18.485 --> 34:20.510
Well, what were you doing
in there?

34:20.554 --> 34:22.079
l was just talking.

34:22.123 --> 34:24.250
But l thought we was here
to case the bank.

34:24.292 --> 34:26.658
That's what l was doing.
He has an inside track.

34:26.694 --> 34:29.356
He works here.
Plus he grabbed me.

34:30.398 --> 34:31.763
Did he ask you out?

34:33.868 --> 34:35.165
Maybe.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.170
So you ain't gonna tell me, huh?

34:37.205 --> 34:39.536
Well, maybe he could
put a smile on my face.

34:50.652 --> 34:53.849
Girl, Luther is gonna kill you
if he sees that baby.

34:53.888 --> 34:56.483
-T.T., What happened?
-l had to bring him with me.

34:56.525 --> 34:59.858
Hey, wait. Whoa!
Don't put him there, please.

34:59.895 --> 35:00.987
Put him over there.

35:45.275 --> 35:46.708
Come on!

35:46.743 --> 35:48.074
-Come on! Move it!
-lt's OK, ma'am.

35:48.111 --> 35:50.602
We can't waste time!
Let's go! Let's go!

35:50.647 --> 35:52.114
Open the elevator!

35:52.149 --> 35:54.049
Open it up! Hurry up!

35:54.084 --> 35:55.244
lt's all right.

36:04.995 --> 36:08.363
l think your son is going
to pull through just fine.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.492
-Yes.
-Can l see him?

36:10.535 --> 36:14.699
You need to speak with Ms. Wells
with Child Protective Services.

36:14.739 --> 36:18.106
No. l know you ain't fixing
to take her son.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.610
Wait, hold the fuck up.
That was an accident.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.705
We was right there,
looking right at him.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.147
lt wasn't two seconds--

36:25.183 --> 36:27.583
l need to talk
to the mother alone.

36:37.128 --> 36:39.927
Ms. Williams, the boy
has been severely poisoned.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.398
l'm sure it was an accident...

36:41.433 --> 36:43.628
but we're going to retain
custody just to be sure...

36:43.669 --> 36:45.967
the child isn't suffering
from neglect.

36:46.004 --> 36:49.667
That's my son.
l would die for him.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.369
He was in an unsafe environment.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.503
He shouldn't have been
at the workplace with you.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.513
l didn't have a choice.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.072
l don't have money
for a baby-sitter.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.516
You're going to have to prove
you can take care of him.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.680
Kids get into poison every day.

37:03.722 --> 37:07.522
Not in the workplace.
To us, that spells neglect.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.857
Now, Jajuan will remain
in our custody...

37:09.895 --> 37:11.920
until you can pay
for proper child care.

37:11.964 --> 37:14.159
What if l can't
come up with the money?

37:14.968 --> 37:17.801
Like l said,
you will get a court date.

37:17.837 --> 37:20.601
At that time, the judge
will decide what will happen.

37:23.776 --> 37:27.234
Please! You can't take my baby.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.248
l'm going to die
without my baby.

37:29.282 --> 37:31.477
Tisean, come on.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.814
l'm gonna die without my baby.

37:32.852 --> 37:34.581
T.T, we're going to handle this.

37:36.089 --> 37:39.024
Fuck this shit.
You know what you got to do.

37:40.593 --> 37:41.753
You know.

37:43.596 --> 37:45.496
You in?

37:49.603 --> 37:51.434
Come on, T.T.

37:59.413 --> 38:01.540
Cleo, take the note
to the merchant teller.

38:01.582 --> 38:03.140
She will have
at least twenty grand.

38:03.183 --> 38:05.708
On Wednesdays,
Sears makes a big deposit...

38:05.753 --> 38:08.085
so she could have
thirty-five thousand.

38:08.122 --> 38:11.614
l give her the note and tell her
not to give me any bait money.

38:11.659 --> 38:14.719
Tell her not to draw
from the right-hand clip.

38:14.762 --> 38:17.526
lf she does,
she's setting off the alarm.

38:17.564 --> 38:18.929
''Don't give me any bait money...

38:18.966 --> 38:20.831
''and if you come out
of that right-hand clip...

38:20.868 --> 38:22.335
''my gun goes in your mouth.''

38:22.369 --> 38:24.838
That's what l'm talking about.

38:24.873 --> 38:26.204
Let's go through plan ''B.''

38:26.241 --> 38:28.505
Plan ''B''?
Fuck this planning shit.

38:28.543 --> 38:30.909
Why can't we just kick butt
with these motherfuckers...

38:30.945 --> 38:32.606
and go up in there
and take all the fucking money?

38:32.647 --> 38:35.912
Why can't you just listen
for once?

38:37.085 --> 38:39.918
Plan ''B,'' Frankie.

38:39.954 --> 38:42.548
Stony, when Cleo goes
to the merchant teller...

38:42.590 --> 38:44.421
you start to survey the line
for the cow.

38:44.959 --> 38:48.053
Cow? There's going to be a cow
up in there?

38:51.099 --> 38:53.260
Stop smoking weed.

38:54.369 --> 38:56.929
Cleo, the cow
is just a small vault on wheels.

38:56.971 --> 38:58.632
They push it
from window to window...

38:58.673 --> 39:00.141
depending on
which teller needs cash.

39:00.910 --> 39:03.504
lf the cow is there,
it'll be open...

39:03.546 --> 39:05.013
and we'll have
at least fifty thousand.

39:36.246 --> 39:37.975
Look here,
let me talk to Black Sam.

39:40.016 --> 39:42.416
Black Sam,
she want to talk to you.

39:51.661 --> 39:53.492
Damn.

39:53.530 --> 39:55.054
Shit.

40:00.804 --> 40:02.795
-So what you need?
-A favor.

40:02.839 --> 40:06.502
Yeah, well, what else is new?

40:06.543 --> 40:08.637
Come on, Black Sam.

40:08.679 --> 40:10.340
After all them cars
l done stole for you?

40:10.381 --> 40:13.407
We're going there, huh?
All right, check it out.

40:14.919 --> 40:17.114
Y'all can roll
with that right there.

40:18.122 --> 40:20.522
We ain't robbin' stagecoaches.

40:21.492 --> 40:23.119
l need something
l can set it off with.

40:23.161 --> 40:24.822
Y'all ain't bullshitting?

40:24.862 --> 40:26.386
We want them guns
we were shooting.

40:26.431 --> 40:29.832
You're tripping.
Y'all can't afford them guns.

40:29.867 --> 40:31.300
That's why it's a favor.

40:32.703 --> 40:35.069
l'll bring them back...
with interest.

40:36.140 --> 40:37.801
With interest, huh?

40:40.144 --> 40:41.543
Check this.

40:42.981 --> 40:45.677
What's up with hooking me up
with your homegirl, Frankie?

40:48.821 --> 40:51.517
lnterest. That's it, Sam.

40:51.557 --> 40:52.751
lt's like that.

40:55.260 --> 40:57.751
l'm going to let y'all
use my shit, right?

40:57.796 --> 41:00.026
But if y'all get caught--

41:00.065 --> 41:02.397
l'm already knowing it. l know.

41:02.434 --> 41:03.731
Yeah, all right.

41:03.769 --> 41:05.430
l'm coming back
for that Uzi, too.

41:06.438 --> 41:09.236
Bruce, go on and hook them up.
The right shit.

41:09.274 --> 41:10.536
All right.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.359
Come on, baby.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.934
What have we got here? Bullshit.

41:42.509 --> 41:43.999
Fucking bullshit.

41:47.647 --> 41:49.308
Now, that's what l ride to.

41:55.923 --> 41:57.413
OK, ready?

41:57.458 --> 41:58.618
Y'all OK?

41:59.860 --> 42:02.294
OK, wait a minute.
Let's just wait.

42:04.498 --> 42:07.023
OK, let's just wait.
Just for a second.

42:08.102 --> 42:09.694
What's wrong?

42:10.804 --> 42:12.032
l can't do this.

42:15.876 --> 42:18.572
Frankie, she's right, OK?
We didn't case this bank.

42:18.612 --> 42:20.079
We cased Downtown Federal.

42:20.114 --> 42:21.945
They're all pretty much
the same.

42:23.617 --> 42:25.608
l ain't feeling this, Frankie.
This ain't right.

42:36.431 --> 42:39.594
Everybody get down
on the ground right now!

42:39.634 --> 42:41.101
Put your hands up!

42:41.136 --> 42:43.104
Everybody stay down!

42:46.641 --> 42:48.609
Go! Go!

42:48.643 --> 42:51.578
-All right!
-Turn around!

42:51.613 --> 42:53.513
All of y'all,
turn the fuck around!

42:53.548 --> 42:55.516
-Don't move!
-Move back! Move back!

42:57.385 --> 42:59.114
Turn around, girl!
What the fuck you looking at?

42:59.154 --> 43:00.712
Give me the money!
Pull out the drawer!

43:00.755 --> 43:03.554
Put the phone down!
Put your arms up!

43:06.162 --> 43:07.356
You better lay down!

43:11.233 --> 43:13.030
-Don't move!
-Y'all just be cool!

43:14.103 --> 43:17.072
Don't move! Don't move!
Stay there.

43:17.106 --> 43:18.971
Fuckers...
what are you looking at?

43:19.008 --> 43:21.169
l'm a bitch with a gun! Two!

43:21.210 --> 43:22.438
We're taking too much time!

43:25.615 --> 43:26.980
-Come on!
-Here we go.

43:29.719 --> 43:31.778
Move it!
We're almost to the door.

43:39.796 --> 43:41.286
Come on! Go, go!

43:58.248 --> 44:02.048
Now, that's how you work it.
That shit was brilliant!

44:02.085 --> 44:04.246
Frankie, we robbed a bank!

44:06.790 --> 44:09.657
Listen to me.
That is a lot of money.

44:09.693 --> 44:11.685
Are we going
to get away with this?

44:11.729 --> 44:14.664
What do you mean?
What does this look like?

44:16.134 --> 44:17.294
ls it ours?

44:20.338 --> 44:22.329
Shit!

44:22.373 --> 44:24.466
Did you lock that door?

44:29.013 --> 44:32.278
-Where have you been?
-l caught the bus.

44:33.151 --> 44:36.917
We weren't ready.
You know we weren't ready.

44:36.954 --> 44:39.388
Look, if l didn't set it off,
we'd be casing banks...

44:39.424 --> 44:41.790
for the next two months.
l had to push off!

44:47.466 --> 44:49.457
lt worked, didn't it?

44:49.501 --> 44:53.096
Look, Tisean, it's over.
We got about...

44:55.174 --> 44:57.699
-What?
-About twelve Gs.

44:58.343 --> 45:01.403
Twelve thousand dollars
in sixty seconds.

45:02.514 --> 45:07.110
Why don't you come over here
and sit down beside me?

45:07.152 --> 45:09.279
OK? Come on.

45:18.297 --> 45:19.787
Sit!

45:24.838 --> 45:27.068
The vehicle stolen
from here today was lDed...

45:27.107 --> 45:29.439
as the getaway car
in that South L.A. bank job.

45:32.045 --> 45:33.774
l want to run prints
on all these.

45:33.813 --> 45:35.576
See if anybody shows up.

45:35.615 --> 45:37.480
All right. Dust everything.

45:43.723 --> 45:46.715
Moi. And...T.T.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.529
T.T.? She ain't getting a cut.

45:50.563 --> 45:53.327
Look, Frankie,
l ain't for your shit tonight.

45:55.268 --> 45:57.134
T.T. needs it
more than any of us.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.230
She didn't do anything.
She walked out.

45:59.273 --> 46:02.174
Who the fuck cares?
She was there.

46:02.209 --> 46:05.508
No! She didn't do nothing,
so she ain't getting nothing.

46:05.546 --> 46:07.070
Forget it.

46:07.114 --> 46:08.775
Frankie,
l don't want your money.

46:09.817 --> 46:13.480
lf you want to kick my ass,
let's get it over with...

46:13.521 --> 46:15.318
because l am sick of your shit.

46:17.158 --> 46:20.127
l need that money.

46:22.696 --> 46:24.220
lt ain't you l'm mad at.

46:25.900 --> 46:28.801
Damn. l'm sorry. l was tripping.

46:32.174 --> 46:33.573
You're my girl.

46:38.113 --> 46:40.138
l need this.

46:41.149 --> 46:43.447
You are so special, Frankie.

46:52.227 --> 46:54.127
Still ain't do shit.

47:00.602 --> 47:04.504
Waller, anything ever come up
on that Francesca Sutton girl?

47:04.539 --> 47:06.371
The bank teller suspected...

47:06.409 --> 47:08.240
of being in collusion
in the Pan-Pacific robbery?

47:08.277 --> 47:09.869
Nothing. Clean as a whistle.

47:12.081 --> 47:14.140
OK, run this again for me.

47:35.104 --> 47:38.130
-Come in for a drink?
-No, thank you.

47:38.174 --> 47:39.836
-You sure?
-Yeah.

47:41.078 --> 47:42.705
All right. Let me get my jacket.

47:43.947 --> 47:46.040
l could have come
and picked you up.

47:46.083 --> 47:48.051
No. l needed the exercise,
thanks.

47:48.085 --> 47:51.020
-You look great.
-Thanks.

47:53.423 --> 47:55.584
-What?
-Nothing.

47:55.626 --> 48:00.393
l've just never been out
with a guy like you before.

48:00.430 --> 48:03.058
A guy like me.
What does that mean?

48:03.100 --> 48:07.366
l see. You must be used
to those roughneck types.

48:07.404 --> 48:08.769
Where are we going to eat?

48:08.805 --> 48:13.139
Maybe you could show me
someplace in your hood.

48:13.176 --> 48:15.771
-ln my hood?
-ln your hood.

48:15.813 --> 48:17.542
No, you ain't trying to flow
like that.

48:17.582 --> 48:19.311
l might be trying to flow
like that.

48:19.350 --> 48:21.818
You're probably
from Harvard and all.

48:21.853 --> 48:24.879
As a matter of fact, l am.
l still got to eat.

48:24.923 --> 48:28.518
l'm still very hungry,
so could we please feed a man...

48:29.527 --> 48:31.552
give him some nourishment
or some sustenance?

48:31.596 --> 48:33.063
That's all l'm asking...

48:33.097 --> 48:35.292
Miss You-need-to-starve-
because-you're-from-Harvard.

48:37.135 --> 48:40.070
This is really
a nice restaurant.

48:40.104 --> 48:43.631
lt's black-owned. l like that.
Do you come here often?

48:43.675 --> 48:47.042
No. l've never been.
l just heard about it.

48:48.146 --> 48:49.273
So where are you from?

48:49.315 --> 48:51.249
D.C. Have you ever been?

48:51.283 --> 48:53.308
Nope.

48:53.352 --> 48:56.753
No, but that's where the mayor
got popped basing up, isn't it?

48:57.790 --> 49:00.918
Nobody's perfect, right?

49:00.960 --> 49:04.088
lt's a great town, though.
l really miss it.

49:04.129 --> 49:06.529
Anyway, l came directly
from New York.

49:07.967 --> 49:09.127
You ever been to New York?

49:12.571 --> 49:15.005
Have you ever been
outside Los Angeles?

49:18.944 --> 49:21.037
When l was in New York,
l was working on Wall Street...

49:21.080 --> 49:23.548
and before that, ''B'' School--

49:23.582 --> 49:24.675
Business school. l'm sorry.

49:24.718 --> 49:27.050
l wanted to go
to business school.

49:27.087 --> 49:30.716
Really? Financing? Marketing?

49:30.757 --> 49:32.884
No. Typing and bookkeeping.

49:36.096 --> 49:39.691
l'm sorry.
ls that not professional enough?

49:39.733 --> 49:41.667
lt's just hard for me to believe
that you're this hard...

49:41.701 --> 49:43.464
when you're so beautiful.

49:44.471 --> 49:47.133
And so tough.

49:47.173 --> 49:50.233
Not tough. l don't think
we have anything in common.

49:50.276 --> 49:54.076
l don't want anything from you.
l really don't.

49:54.114 --> 49:56.582
l have no expectations,
no demands.

49:56.616 --> 49:58.585
l am quite content...

49:59.954 --> 50:01.581
just listening to you...

50:01.622 --> 50:03.180
sitting here...

50:04.291 --> 50:08.284
staring into those beautiful,
pretty brown eyes.

50:10.131 --> 50:11.496
Are you cross-eyed?

50:12.633 --> 50:15.295
No. Your head is just small.

50:17.271 --> 50:18.738
My head is small.

50:18.773 --> 50:21.537
Makes my eyes go this way...

50:21.575 --> 50:24.772
because l have to focus in
on your little peanut.

50:24.812 --> 50:25.972
No, l'm just kidding.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.818
This is it.

50:36.858 --> 50:39.258
lt's not much, but it's home.

50:40.629 --> 50:42.028
l took the lease
over from my brother...

50:42.064 --> 50:43.361
who brought me to L.A.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.324
Do you feel free?

50:46.368 --> 50:47.926
Hell, yeah, l feel free.

50:50.972 --> 50:54.135
Well, l don't feel free.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.644
l feel very much caged.

50:56.678 --> 51:00.580
Caged?
What are you doing about it?

51:00.615 --> 51:02.173
What do you mean?

51:02.217 --> 51:04.014
What are you doing
to get out of it?

51:04.052 --> 51:05.519
What are your plans?

51:05.554 --> 51:08.490
Where do you see yourself
in five years, Stony?

51:10.126 --> 51:11.525
l don't know.

51:12.895 --> 51:15.796
That's what l'm saying.

51:15.832 --> 51:20.394
We don't plan for the future,
as a people.

51:20.436 --> 51:21.562
Have you ever thought about it?

51:21.604 --> 51:24.835
Just put some serious thought
into seeing your future?

51:26.109 --> 51:27.804
Well, l worked
really hard to keep...

51:27.844 --> 51:30.176
a roof over
me and my brother's head...

51:30.213 --> 51:32.147
to keep clothes on our back...

51:34.183 --> 51:37.243
And l planned on
sending him to college.

51:37.286 --> 51:38.947
That's great.
Then he should go to college.

51:38.988 --> 51:41.115
He'll go on and accomplish
tremendous things...

51:41.157 --> 51:43.592
and be great and wonderful,
like his sister.

51:43.627 --> 51:45.094
He's dead.

51:49.233 --> 51:51.497
l'm sorry. l didn't realize.

51:51.535 --> 51:54.095
-lt's OK.
-No, it's not.

51:56.673 --> 51:58.607
l'm dealing with it.

51:59.409 --> 52:00.501
You are, aren't you?

52:04.114 --> 52:06.582
ls that a cabernet or a merlot?

52:06.617 --> 52:08.312
Damn.

52:10.320 --> 52:13.084
-Take care of it.
-All right.

52:31.676 --> 52:34.304
Captain Fredricks, sir?

52:34.345 --> 52:35.835
Do you remember
the Pan-Pacific bank robbery...

52:35.880 --> 52:38.610
where four people were killed
and the subsequent arrest...

52:38.650 --> 52:40.117
where a young man
was shot and killed?

52:40.151 --> 52:42.176
We're still getting
bad press with that.

52:42.220 --> 52:44.415
l'd like to bring in
his sister Lita Newsome.

52:44.455 --> 52:45.581
l think
she's one of the bank robbers.

52:45.623 --> 52:46.749
What you got?

52:46.791 --> 52:48.520
Right now l've got a girl
named Francesca Sutton.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.551
She's a teller
at the Pan-Pacific bank...

52:50.595 --> 52:53.121
and l'm relatively certain
she was connected.

52:53.165 --> 52:54.496
Go on.

52:54.533 --> 52:57.127
Francesca Sutton and
Lita Newsome are best friends.

52:57.169 --> 52:59.637
Right,
that's a big coincidence...

52:59.672 --> 53:02.072
but there's also
a physical likeness--

53:02.107 --> 53:04.166
Do you remember the headline?

53:05.144 --> 53:07.078
''lnnocent student
killed by cops.''

53:07.112 --> 53:08.773
Now you want
to bring in his sister...

53:08.814 --> 53:10.907
based on the fact
that she knows someone...

53:10.950 --> 53:12.110
who may be friends
with a bank robber?

53:12.151 --> 53:13.277
You're goddamn right--

53:13.319 --> 53:16.311
What the hell's wrong
with you, Strode? No way!

53:16.355 --> 53:18.220
Can l get a tail on her, sir?

53:18.257 --> 53:20.725
What part of ''no''
don't you understand, Strode?

53:20.759 --> 53:22.283
The ''N'' or the ''O''?

53:39.779 --> 53:41.576
Oh, shit, now.

53:41.615 --> 53:42.775
Watch it!

53:46.853 --> 53:48.548
Fuck them niggers. Yeah!

53:52.092 --> 53:54.925
Watch it, honey.
Here it come now.

54:22.790 --> 54:24.519
Yeah, now.

54:24.558 --> 54:27.584
Shit, girl. What is you--

54:27.628 --> 54:31.120
Cleo, how come you ain't been
to work in a week?

54:31.165 --> 54:33.360
'Cause look what l got here.

54:34.302 --> 54:36.202
l bought my baby
some new things.

54:36.237 --> 54:37.728
Check them out.

54:39.074 --> 54:40.268
Luther said you're fired.

54:43.979 --> 54:46.709
We got to act
like nothing's different.

54:46.748 --> 54:49.615
You need to get to Luther's
and get your job back.

54:49.651 --> 54:51.846
Man, Luther can kiss
my ashy kneecap.

54:51.887 --> 54:54.082
This money got you tripping.

54:55.324 --> 54:57.622
l know you out of money
by now, Cleo.

54:57.659 --> 54:59.854
Now what you going to do?

54:59.895 --> 55:02.955
Rob another goddamn bank.
What the fuck is y'all thinking?

55:02.998 --> 55:05.330
Hold up. We said once, Cleo...

55:05.367 --> 55:07.392
to get us enough change
to get out of here!

55:07.436 --> 55:12.170
That's all it is, Stony.
We need some real money.

55:12.208 --> 55:14.403
l don't know how far out of town
you plan to get, baby sister...

55:14.444 --> 55:17.072
but you ain't
getting far on three grand.

55:17.113 --> 55:18.273
Really?

55:20.116 --> 55:21.743
All right, Louise,
you take Thelma over there...

55:21.784 --> 55:24.981
and y'all go rob another bank
if you all that.

55:27.857 --> 55:29.017
Fuck you.

55:30.360 --> 55:33.420
l know you ain't fin to back
down on us now we need you.

55:35.064 --> 55:37.259
l want some more
motherfucking money.

55:40.136 --> 55:42.104
You are real high...

55:42.138 --> 55:45.130
and you acting real stupid.

55:46.643 --> 55:49.134
You need to get
that gun out my face.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.141
Shit!

55:54.184 --> 55:57.119
Don't you ever fucking
raise a gun to me again!

55:57.154 --> 55:58.951
Or what?

55:58.989 --> 56:00.217
What!

56:01.325 --> 56:03.190
Are you going to hit me,
motherfucker?

56:04.561 --> 56:06.552
Stony,
we go back to first grade!

56:06.597 --> 56:09.065
You been my peeps
for twenty years!

56:09.099 --> 56:10.589
Get off of me!

56:13.303 --> 56:14.964
You know what? l ain't
fucking with you no more.

56:16.940 --> 56:19.170
Yeah, well, fuck you, too!

56:23.047 --> 56:24.207
Fuck her!

56:30.121 --> 56:32.589
¡Ay, qué linda! Come on in.

56:32.624 --> 56:34.091
How you doing?

56:34.125 --> 56:35.592
l'm all right.

56:35.627 --> 56:39.461
You sure? All right.
Hope you like Mexican food.

56:39.497 --> 56:42.091
We have fajitas, enchiladas,
special sauce.

56:42.133 --> 56:44.101
Have a seat right there.

56:44.135 --> 56:46.103
You say you don't travel a lot.

56:46.137 --> 56:47.434
This is what
we're going to do, Stony.

56:48.773 --> 56:52.539
From here on out, l cook.
We eat.

56:52.577 --> 56:55.604
You pick the country,
starting with Mexico.

56:55.648 --> 56:58.981
Now, sit back. Relax.

56:59.018 --> 57:00.542
Take a load off your feet.

57:00.586 --> 57:04.852
Smell the aroma of Mexico
and the sounds...

57:07.092 --> 57:08.582
What?

57:10.596 --> 57:13.258
l just got a lot on my mind.

57:15.468 --> 57:16.628
You want to talk about it?

57:26.545 --> 57:29.982
What do you think about
friends and money?

57:31.618 --> 57:33.210
l think they don't mix. Why?

57:33.253 --> 57:36.313
l just had
a very big argument...

57:36.356 --> 57:39.917
with one of my best friends
about a money situation...

57:41.428 --> 57:43.521
and l don't think
we're gonna be friends anymore.

57:45.131 --> 57:47.599
Don't you lose that friend
over money.

57:47.634 --> 57:49.124
lt's not worth it.

57:50.637 --> 57:54.539
The money you can replace easy.

57:55.742 --> 57:59.109
Friends--
real friends...you can't.

58:00.280 --> 58:01.770
Don't sweat it.

58:03.083 --> 58:06.053
You have the answer
to everything, don't you?

58:06.087 --> 58:08.055
No, l wouldn't say that.

58:08.089 --> 58:10.057
l'm just sharing
my experience with you.

58:10.091 --> 58:12.389
Who do you think you are?

58:13.594 --> 58:15.653
l'll be your genie
if you let me.

58:17.031 --> 58:20.626
Your every wish is my command.

58:31.546 --> 58:34.743
Cleo, you know you was wrong
for what you did to Stony.

58:34.782 --> 58:38.240
Fuck her! Fuck Stony!
We'll do this without her.

58:38.286 --> 58:41.586
Wait a minute. Let's suppose
Stony put a gun in your face.

58:41.623 --> 58:44.820
What would you do?
l would have slapped you, too.

58:44.860 --> 58:47.852
Come on, now.
l wasn't gonna shoot her.

58:49.264 --> 58:51.095
You know how l get
when l'm faded.

58:51.133 --> 58:52.623
You still was wrong.

58:55.504 --> 58:58.905
T.T., what's my girl gonna do?

58:58.941 --> 59:00.101
l know you got to step
to that judge...

59:00.142 --> 59:02.610
and prove you got some coins
in the bank.

59:02.644 --> 59:05.112
l ain't doing nothing
without Stony.

59:10.786 --> 59:12.481
l don't want to give
that ho no ride.

59:12.521 --> 59:14.285
Why don't you
stop acting like a baby?

59:38.514 --> 59:39.742
Bingo.

59:41.718 --> 59:42.912
Come to me, baby. Oh, yeah.

59:42.952 --> 59:45.386
Grin in that photo.
You love to see it.

59:48.024 --> 59:49.890
Hey, Waller.

59:51.028 --> 59:52.495
Tell me something...

59:52.529 --> 59:58.161
did l or did l not say
all these women run together?

01:00:01.038 --> 01:00:04.201
Do you feel me?
l thought that you would.

01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:05.799
Work with me, baby.

01:00:11.548 --> 01:00:13.516
Look, l'm sorry.

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:15.711
You're sorry.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.549
Let's just put it all behind us.

01:00:20.557 --> 01:00:24.551
Come on. We been through worse.

01:00:26.064 --> 01:00:28.055
Apology accepted.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.367
But you know you need
to come back in with us.

01:00:32.404 --> 01:00:34.838
You ain't got enough money
to get out of town.

01:00:36.574 --> 01:00:38.269
You're right about that.

01:00:39.577 --> 01:00:41.442
But l want more than that.

01:00:42.747 --> 01:00:44.544
l mean, is this the only way?

01:00:44.582 --> 01:00:47.380
See, 'cause
l want to be somebody...

01:00:47.419 --> 01:00:50.013
who doesn't have to do this,
you know what l'm saying?

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:55.684
Stony, you can go to suburbia
and start a new life...

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:58.823
but we ain't nothing
but hood rats.

01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:02.958
Now, l can live with that.
You can't.

01:01:04.537 --> 01:01:07.028
The hood is where l belong.

01:01:09.809 --> 01:01:12.004
l mean, what am l
going to do in Hollywood...

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.308
or Thousand Oaks or some shit?

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:17.512
Man, shit.

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:20.075
Why do we got to roll over
and accept that, though?

01:01:21.787 --> 01:01:23.448
We got to have a plan.

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:26.553
What does our future look like?

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.052
Where do you see yourself
five years from now?

01:01:34.968 --> 01:01:36.128
l don't know...

01:01:36.837 --> 01:01:37.997
and l don't care.

01:01:39.606 --> 01:01:41.574
And l ain't thinking
about five years from now.

01:01:43.443 --> 01:01:45.536
l'm just trying
to get through today.

01:01:45.579 --> 01:01:47.069
What the hell?

01:01:48.582 --> 01:01:52.143
Cleo, l know you didn't come
to work.

01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:55.154
Ain't been to work
and don't call nobody.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.081
l'm broke, Luther.

01:01:59.126 --> 01:02:00.559
l know you gonna give me
my old job back...

01:02:00.594 --> 01:02:03.825
'cause don't nobody take shit
the way l take shit.

01:02:03.864 --> 01:02:06.856
Shut up before l stick that mop
up your ass, Luther.

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.166
You better save that
for your little girlfriend.

01:02:11.405 --> 01:02:14.704
Well? Get to work!

01:02:14.742 --> 01:02:18.439
Ladies...and gentlemen!

01:02:24.152 --> 01:02:26.518
There's been a rift
in this family...

01:02:26.554 --> 01:02:29.022
and that is not
good for business.

01:02:29.056 --> 01:02:32.082
We want a plan like it was.
Back to work, see?

01:02:33.294 --> 01:02:37.526
lf only Tisean and Stony
will come rob the bank with us.

01:02:37.565 --> 01:02:39.760
We started as a gang of four.

01:02:39.801 --> 01:02:41.962
We must always be four.

01:02:43.539 --> 01:02:47.839
Don Stony from the Bronx,
what is your opinion?

01:02:47.876 --> 01:02:50.071
Should we rob the bank?

01:02:56.518 --> 01:02:59.578
Only way l can return
to this family.

01:03:01.356 --> 01:03:06.919
lf we do this one more time,
we do it right.

01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:11.265
Get enough money to get us
up out of here for good.

01:03:13.502 --> 01:03:15.902
T.T., you agree?

01:03:20.243 --> 01:03:24.976
Cleomenza, no more
funny-looking underwear...

01:03:25.014 --> 01:03:26.675
for your little girlfriend.

01:03:26.716 --> 01:03:27.842
Cleomenza...

01:03:27.884 --> 01:03:31.980
no more...fancy cars.

01:03:34.257 --> 01:03:38.023
The shopping sprees...

01:03:39.796 --> 01:03:44.358
Cleomenza, can you respect
our conditions?

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.598
Can you live with the terms
that your dons have set forth?

01:03:53.043 --> 01:03:54.806
Yes, Godfather.

01:03:55.746 --> 01:03:58.579
Tisean Scalina from Detroit...

01:03:58.616 --> 01:04:00.447
are you cool with all of this?

01:04:02.887 --> 01:04:06.618
And you,
Don Stony from the Bronx...

01:04:07.858 --> 01:04:10.156
can you accept
your godfather's terms?

01:04:15.532 --> 01:04:18.467
All right, then.
We back in effect.

01:04:18.502 --> 01:04:20.902
Next stop is
Balboa Savings & Loan.

01:04:24.008 --> 01:04:25.999
Think you can do that?

01:04:28.013 --> 01:04:29.503
Hurry up.

01:04:39.024 --> 01:04:40.514
You got it?

01:04:46.031 --> 01:04:47.999
Come on, Cleo.
What are you doing?

01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:52.129
-Pass me a tape.
-No. Let's go.

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:54.832
l ain't going nowhere
till you pass me a tape.

01:04:58.043 --> 01:05:00.477
Take that shit and let's go.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:17.462
-Help me out.
-Please don't.

01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:19.464
Come on.
l've been out here all night.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:20.965
l'm sorry.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.968
Come on. Just a couple
of bucks or something.

01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:26.460
l'm sorry, ma'am.
Sir, please, will you stop?

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:28.473
You're annoying
our customers out here.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:31.567
l'm not hurting anybody.
Come on, man.

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:35.478
l want you to move down
and leave our people alone.

01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:37.483
Now, l've been asked
to come out here--

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.985
Come on, man.
l'm not hurting anybody.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.147
-You're drunk.
-No, l'm not.

01:05:49.963 --> 01:05:52.397
Everybody get the fuck down
right now!

01:05:52.432 --> 01:05:53.990
Move it! You, down!

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:57.094
Hands over your head!
Back away from the drawers!

01:05:57.137 --> 01:05:59.264
That's right, you!
Move back! Get down!

01:05:59.306 --> 01:06:01.604
Open that drawer!
Fill it up! Let's go!

01:06:01.641 --> 01:06:04.576
Did you hear what l said? Down!

01:06:04.611 --> 01:06:07.239
Back up! Back up!

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.838
You, up! Let's go!

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.182
Oh, please!
Oh, please, mama!

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.211
Bitch,
would you shut the fuck up?

01:06:14.255 --> 01:06:17.486
Nobody move!

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.920
-What's going on here?
-We're having difficulties--

01:06:21.963 --> 01:06:23.954
l'm not bothering anybody.

01:06:23.998 --> 01:06:25.465
Come on.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.865
What's happening?

01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:29.301
A minute and a half! Come on!

01:06:29.337 --> 01:06:31.362
Just get your money.
Don't be a hero. Let's go!

01:06:35.009 --> 01:06:36.601
You! Open up the cow!

01:06:37.678 --> 01:06:39.976
We need backup over here.

01:06:40.014 --> 01:06:42.312
We got a vagrant
that's drunk and disorderly.

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.511
Would you send
another unit, please?

01:06:44.552 --> 01:06:46.714
Come on! Let's make it!

01:06:46.755 --> 01:06:47.847
Move it!

01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.654
-Let's make it! Come on!
-Cover me!

01:06:52.494 --> 01:06:54.462
Don't make me
get ugly up in here...

01:06:54.496 --> 01:06:57.556
ladies and gentlemen...
not today.

01:06:59.535 --> 01:07:02.436
Hey, you! Keep your hands down!

01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:05.304
Everybody face down!
Face down!

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.274
Let's go! Let's go!

01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:08.867
Keep him in line, girl.

01:07:10.612 --> 01:07:14.378
-Down!
-Hey! Come on, let's make it!

01:07:57.528 --> 01:08:00.019
Hey! Don't.

01:08:00.064 --> 01:08:02.089
Do not.

01:08:02.133 --> 01:08:03.998
Where's Cleo?

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:23.015
Come on! Let's go!

01:08:26.557 --> 01:08:28.991
Let's go, God damn it!

01:08:29.026 --> 01:08:31.120
You are crazy, Cleo.

01:08:40.205 --> 01:08:42.173
Holy shit!

01:08:43.308 --> 01:08:45.071
Move! Move!

01:08:46.044 --> 01:08:48.238
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.871
Yeah! We dig that shit!

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:33.156
The way you busted
through that wall!

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:36.962
We did it!

01:09:36.996 --> 01:09:39.488
l thought it was over,
with the cops right outside!

01:09:39.533 --> 01:09:40.727
Where was you going?

01:09:40.767 --> 01:09:43.133
l was coming
to get y'all's asses!

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:44.966
What about T.T.?

01:09:45.005 --> 01:09:47.667
The way she got the drop
on the cop!

01:09:47.707 --> 01:09:50.108
lf you think of anything else,
give us a call today.

01:09:57.017 --> 01:10:00.475
-Where's the girls?
-Took off in the Suburban.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.717
The getaway car was blocked.
They're still out there.

01:10:03.757 --> 01:10:06.988
Car theft reports from
near the 21st Street garage.

01:10:07.027 --> 01:10:08.289
Getting in way over their heads,
aren't they?

01:10:10.464 --> 01:10:11.692
They don't fucking know it.

01:10:11.732 --> 01:10:14.964
Man, counting money is
harder than working for Luther.

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:16.493
l'm getting dizzy up here!

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:27.470
Two hundred and ninety-six
thousand and counting!

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:31.611
-What's that?
-seventy-five thousand apiece.

01:10:33.154 --> 01:10:37.352
Seventy-five thousand apiece.
That's a lot of money.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:40.153
l'm rich!

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.755
Look at all of this.

01:10:44.799 --> 01:10:46.494
Look, this is
what we're going to do.

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.331
We're going to keep
scrubbing floors for Luther...

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.133
like we've been doing.
Nothing's changed.

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:53.369
We get Jajuan, and in
three days, we are out of here!

01:10:53.409 --> 01:10:54.842
l'm going to miss you all.

01:10:56.578 --> 01:10:58.944
Well, what happened?
What did she do?

01:10:58.981 --> 01:11:01.006
Girl, you know
you coming with us.

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:04.042
l got money!

01:11:07.323 --> 01:11:08.449
You run the CDs
from the parking garage?

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:09.957
Yeah. They're clean.

01:11:09.992 --> 01:11:12.961
Give these a try.
lt's all connected.

01:11:12.995 --> 01:11:14.986
All right.
We'll get these dusted now.

01:11:43.727 --> 01:11:46.992
How come we're putting the money
in here instead of at home?

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:50.363
lf the police track us down,
that's the first place to look.

01:11:54.537 --> 01:11:56.528
All right.

01:12:00.344 --> 01:12:02.904
Stony, listen. l'm substituting
for my boss tonight...

01:12:02.947 --> 01:12:05.438
at a party for the National
Association of Bankers...

01:12:05.483 --> 01:12:08.384
at the Biltmore,
and l'd like for you to come--

01:12:10.654 --> 01:12:12.451
Damn it.

01:12:14.492 --> 01:12:16.289
That would be really nice.

01:12:16.327 --> 01:12:18.795
Great. Listen,
be here early, like 6:00...

01:12:18.829 --> 01:12:20.421
because l don't know
what time the limo's coming...

01:12:20.464 --> 01:12:21.897
since you won't let me
pick you up.

01:12:21.932 --> 01:12:23.194
Limo?

01:12:23.234 --> 01:12:25.964
Black tie. Limo. 6:00.

01:12:26.003 --> 01:12:27.800
l'll see you then.

01:12:34.012 --> 01:12:36.480
Y'all are real rude.

01:12:36.515 --> 01:12:38.915
l know you heard me
on the phone.

01:12:48.527 --> 01:12:50.085
Do you like it?

01:12:51.863 --> 01:12:53.990
Yeah. You look great.

01:12:54.032 --> 01:12:56.660
No, you don't.

01:12:56.701 --> 01:12:59.033
No. lt's colorful.

01:13:01.306 --> 01:13:02.967
We're late. l'll be right back.

01:13:04.476 --> 01:13:07.969
l told Frankie l look
like a box of crayons.

01:13:14.754 --> 01:13:16.779
So, you like?

01:13:16.823 --> 01:13:20.315
lt's real nice.
You got a bar. You got crystal.

01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:23.453
We've been spending
a lot of time together lately...

01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:24.963
and it's been nice.

01:13:24.997 --> 01:13:28.330
We've been real straightforward
with one another, honest...

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:30.995
but l have lied about one thing.

01:13:32.505 --> 01:13:34.996
What have you lied about?

01:13:36.509 --> 01:13:37.976
Let's take a little detour.

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:40.945
Alex, do me a favor.
Change of plans.

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.973
Take a right at the next light,
and l'll tell you from there.

01:14:31.499 --> 01:14:32.932
Should we go?

01:14:40.441 --> 01:14:43.842
You're doing great, baby.
Enjoy yourself tonight.

01:14:45.346 --> 01:14:47.678
-Champagne?
-Yes. Thank you.

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.749
Are you nervous?

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.754
-Don't be.
-OK.

01:14:57.793 --> 01:15:00.421
You are the most
beautiful lady in the room.

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:03.431
Don't you ever forget that.

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:04.932
Hey, Nigel.
How you doing, buddy?

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:07.936
-How you doing?
-Patrice.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.939
Thank God you're here.
l was getting tired...

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:13.373
of making clever banter
with Ross Milner.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.934
-Hello. l'm Nigel.
-Hi.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:19.436
You're Miss New Account.
Your follow-up is impressive.

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:22.939
l taught Keith everything
about corporate banking.

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:24.850
l'd like you to meet my--

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.446
Lady.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:34.452
There are some heavy hitters
here--Muchigawa from Sonawa.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.465
Yeah. l saw Storum
from Citibank over there.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:40.128
Check this out--if a terrorist
blew this place up...

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:42.468
the banking systems
of Japan, Europe...

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:44.473
and the United States
would never recover.

01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:46.475
l thought that a room
full of dead bankers...

01:15:46.509 --> 01:15:49.034
meant that the world
would be a better place.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.277
My wife.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:55.978
So, Stony,
are you in banking also?

01:15:56.019 --> 01:15:58.988
Yes...in a way.

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:02.390
Wells Fargo, B. of A., Chemical?

01:16:02.426 --> 01:16:04.917
l prefer to create
my own personalized portfolio...

01:16:04.962 --> 01:16:09.422
reflecting an original, diverse
taste in funding sources.

01:16:09.467 --> 01:16:10.627
Well.

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:15.928
Always got me in trouble.
Always raiding sororities.

01:16:15.973 --> 01:16:19.431
So he hasn't grown up yet,
but we're working on him.

01:16:19.477 --> 01:16:21.968
Right. He seems like a nice guy.

01:16:22.013 --> 01:16:24.948
No. He's terrible. l hate him.

01:16:24.982 --> 01:16:26.449
He's a good guy.

01:16:26.484 --> 01:16:27.746
l want you to know...

01:16:28.986 --> 01:16:31.511
this is one of
the best nights of my life.

01:16:32.823 --> 01:16:35.223
l've never felt so special.

01:16:35.259 --> 01:16:37.626
Do you feel free now?

01:16:37.663 --> 01:16:41.463
Well, for now,
but it's not my life.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.468
l've just borrowed
from pieces of yours.

01:16:43.502 --> 01:16:47.768
Borrowing's not a bad thing,
as long as you return the favor.

01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:55.640
Look at all your friends.
They all own banks.

01:16:55.681 --> 01:16:58.514
Where l'm from, you're lucky
to have a bank account.

01:17:01.453 --> 01:17:04.115
l just want to get out of here.

01:17:04.156 --> 01:17:06.181
Have you ever felt like that...

01:17:06.224 --> 01:17:07.987
like you just wanted
to get up and go...

01:17:08.026 --> 01:17:09.994
and move forward and you can't?

01:17:10.028 --> 01:17:11.894
Baby, you don't
have to go anywhere.

01:17:12.965 --> 01:17:15.934
Stay with me
for a little while...

01:17:15.968 --> 01:17:19.495
and then you decide
if you want to stick around.

01:17:21.441 --> 01:17:23.466
You think about it.

01:17:26.479 --> 01:17:28.413
With your fine self.

01:19:18.961 --> 01:19:20.451
You crazy.

01:19:23.465 --> 01:19:26.434
Hi. l'm Pete Rodney.
l'm taking over for Luther.

01:19:26.468 --> 01:19:27.935
Where's Luther?

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:29.939
He ain't cleaning
this building no more.

01:19:29.973 --> 01:19:31.463
He got out of the business.

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:33.935
l'm going to--

01:19:33.977 --> 01:19:36.468
-Hi.
-How you doing?

01:19:43.186 --> 01:19:45.984
This motherfucker
better not touch that money.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:48.985
Rip it!

01:19:51.494 --> 01:19:54.952
-Come on. Come on.
-lt's gone.

01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:57.990
l'm going to kill
this motherfucker! Come on.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.981
Yo, Sam. You got company.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.984
Hey, Sam, you seen Luther?

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.047
Luther came by here earlier.

01:20:18.089 --> 01:20:19.488
Looked like he came
upon some dollars.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:23.482
Had this shit all permed up.
What's up?

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:27.224
We got twisted, man--
our money and your interest.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:33.503
That's why
that fool was acting crazy.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:36.995
See, now you're fucking
with my money, though.

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:40.011
But l know where he at.

01:20:40.045 --> 01:20:43.014
He at a hotel
over there on 55th...

01:20:43.048 --> 01:20:45.016
55th and Ninth.

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:46.540
Thanks.

01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:54.650
Got a little something
for that ass, baby.

01:21:21.521 --> 01:21:23.921
Climb out the pussy
for a minute, Luther.

01:21:26.793 --> 01:21:28.556
Find it!

01:21:28.594 --> 01:21:30.619
Look all around this room.
Tear it up if you have to.

01:21:31.597 --> 01:21:33.690
You think you slick, huh?
Check her stuff, too.

01:21:34.634 --> 01:21:36.101
You slick, right?

01:21:38.104 --> 01:21:42.131
You better be here
for a good goddamn reason.

01:21:42.175 --> 01:21:45.008
Money is a good goddamn reason.
Where is it?

01:21:45.044 --> 01:21:47.035
What you talking about, money?

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.174
l'm going to ask you
one more time.

01:21:49.216 --> 01:21:51.275
Where's my money?

01:21:51.318 --> 01:21:53.878
Cleo, look, l don't know
nothing about no money.

01:21:53.921 --> 01:21:56.685
You don't know
what the fuck l'm talking about?

01:21:56.724 --> 01:21:58.658
What the fuck is this, huh?

01:21:58.692 --> 01:22:00.956
Look at this shit--
watches and crystal...

01:22:00.995 --> 01:22:03.463
and shit you done bought
with my motherfucking money.

01:22:04.498 --> 01:22:06.125
Talking all that nonsense.

01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:08.464
You don't know what
the hell l'm talking about.

01:22:08.502 --> 01:22:10.970
Now look...

01:22:11.005 --> 01:22:12.472
l ain't lying.

01:22:12.506 --> 01:22:13.996
What the fuck is this?

01:22:15.242 --> 01:22:16.800
My money.

01:22:16.844 --> 01:22:19.677
All right, bro.

01:22:22.016 --> 01:22:24.918
Oh, my God.

01:22:29.124 --> 01:22:30.853
Oh, fuck.

01:22:37.699 --> 01:22:39.929
''Alissa Lyons, 423 Moorpark.''

01:22:39.968 --> 01:22:42.027
You didn't see
none of this shit, right?

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.837
All right. Just a little
fucking insurance, baby.

01:22:46.875 --> 01:22:50.606
Now where the fuck
did Luther hide that money?

01:22:50.645 --> 01:22:51.669
l swear l don't know.

01:22:51.713 --> 01:22:55.410
Damn it, don't give me that!
You know!

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:56.610
l swear l just met him.

01:22:56.651 --> 01:22:59.587
-Come on.
-Give me the money!

01:22:59.622 --> 01:23:01.146
Come on!

01:23:13.002 --> 01:23:14.970
l'll call you.

01:23:15.004 --> 01:23:16.995
l hope so.

01:23:20.509 --> 01:23:23.000
This weekend. ltalian.

01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:29.841
l'll call you.

01:23:42.799 --> 01:23:43.993
Man, l ain't trying to hear
this shit today.

01:23:44.034 --> 01:23:46.002
Which one of you girls
smoked Luther?

01:23:46.036 --> 01:23:48.004
l'm thinking it was you...

01:23:48.038 --> 01:23:50.006
because you're the only one
with any priors.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.008
l don't know what the fuck
you talking about.

01:23:52.042 --> 01:23:54.010
l'll tell you what the fuck
l'm talking about.

01:23:54.044 --> 01:23:56.012
We're going to take a ride
down to Parker Center.

01:23:56.046 --> 01:23:59.504
Man, you ain't
got probable cause for shit.

01:23:59.549 --> 01:24:01.244
All you're doing
is participating in a lineup.

01:24:01.284 --> 01:24:03.479
And for the record,
having a witness...

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.954
is one fuck of a lot better
than probable cause.

01:24:05.989 --> 01:24:07.480
Get in the car.

01:24:08.993 --> 01:24:10.426
Today!

01:24:12.263 --> 01:24:14.231
Take this home. Call the girls.

01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:22.403
-They can't see me?
-Just your imagination.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.964
Looks like
they're looking right at me.

01:24:24.008 --> 01:24:25.475
Do you see her?

01:24:26.544 --> 01:24:28.478
The person
that killed Luther Morris?

01:24:28.513 --> 01:24:30.981
Take your time and concentrate.

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:35.812
Face right!

01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:45.656
Do you see her--

01:24:45.697 --> 01:24:47.597
the person that killed
Luther Morris?

01:24:52.471 --> 01:24:54.063
No. lt's not her.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.405
Be sure now.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.204
Do you see her--

01:24:59.244 --> 01:25:02.008
the person that killed
Luther Morris?

01:25:05.984 --> 01:25:07.576
Look at her!

01:25:07.619 --> 01:25:09.109
Get a real good look,
real close.

01:25:09.154 --> 01:25:11.145
Right there. See her?

01:25:11.924 --> 01:25:13.551
The person that smoked Luther.

01:25:14.459 --> 01:25:15.619
Nope.

01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:19.925
Can l go now?

01:25:33.146 --> 01:25:34.340
You're real cute.

01:25:37.183 --> 01:25:39.481
They got Cleo,
and y'all fucking killed Luther!

01:25:39.519 --> 01:25:41.419
He wouldn't give up the money.

01:25:42.355 --> 01:25:44.789
He was about to kill Cleo,
so Tisean shot him.

01:25:44.824 --> 01:25:46.724
Now l got Cleo in trouble.

01:25:46.759 --> 01:25:49.091
-Damn it! Shit!
-l'm sorry, Stony.

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:52.328
Look...

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.632
they're going to be
after all of us.

01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:57.728
We're going to take that bank
downtown. Are you in?

01:25:57.771 --> 01:26:00.467
No, l ain't in! Hell, no!

01:26:01.642 --> 01:26:03.610
You ain't got no fucking choice.

01:26:03.644 --> 01:26:07.273
And you don't tell me what
fucking choices l have, Frankie!

01:26:09.783 --> 01:26:12.013
That's armed robbery...

01:26:12.052 --> 01:26:13.417
and it's murder.

01:26:15.422 --> 01:26:18.914
You said we weren't going
to hurt anybody, Frankie.

01:26:20.761 --> 01:26:22.786
Girl, l got to have money
before my court date.

01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:24.161
l have to.

01:26:25.899 --> 01:26:27.800
And l can't go to jail...

01:26:27.836 --> 01:26:29.633
for killing nobody.

01:26:31.072 --> 01:26:32.403
l need you.

01:26:33.341 --> 01:26:35.366
l really need you.

01:26:39.047 --> 01:26:40.571
Cleo, what happened?
You all right?

01:26:40.615 --> 01:26:42.105
Baby, go pack our shit.

01:26:43.018 --> 01:26:44.986
Them motherfuckers
was all over me...

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.487
but l represented.

01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:48.682
Now the problem is,
they on our ass now...

01:26:48.723 --> 01:26:50.918
and we got to do two things--

01:26:50.959 --> 01:26:53.553
rob another bank
and get the fuck out of here--

01:26:53.595 --> 01:26:55.529
or we going to be in jail
by tomorrow morning.

01:26:55.563 --> 01:26:57.463
l say we hit Downtown Federal.

01:26:57.499 --> 01:26:58.932
That's where
the most money's at.

01:26:58.967 --> 01:27:02.335
l'm telling y'all, we could get
five hundred thousand.

01:27:02.371 --> 01:27:04.134
Fuck it. We hitting that shit.
Simple as that.

01:27:10.746 --> 01:27:13.271
Look, Stony, we hot!

01:27:14.517 --> 01:27:16.041
We all facing a murder rap!

01:27:16.085 --> 01:27:18.883
Does it have to be
Downtown Federal?

01:27:18.921 --> 01:27:20.354
What the fuck is that?

01:27:21.223 --> 01:27:23.054
What, did you go and play us...

01:27:23.092 --> 01:27:24.821
over that bumpy at the bank?

01:27:34.904 --> 01:27:36.065
Fine.

01:27:41.144 --> 01:27:42.304
lt's on.

01:27:52.122 --> 01:27:53.521
l know you have a court date
tomorrow.

01:27:53.557 --> 01:27:55.525
Good luck, Tisean.

01:27:55.559 --> 01:27:56.890
Thanks, Ms. Wells.

01:27:58.595 --> 01:28:00.290
l think everything's
going to be OK.

01:28:02.799 --> 01:28:04.232
l'm sure it is.

01:28:05.535 --> 01:28:06.968
Come here.

01:28:08.605 --> 01:28:10.597
Everything's going to be
just fine.

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:13.768
Come on. Let's go.

01:28:34.632 --> 01:28:36.395
OK, ladies, will that be all?

01:28:36.434 --> 01:28:37.867
Some more coffee.

01:28:46.912 --> 01:28:49.710
l don't think you should be
drinking so much coffee.

01:28:49.748 --> 01:28:51.716
You making me nervous.

01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:53.980
How the fuck is my drinking
coffee making you nervous?

01:28:54.019 --> 01:28:57.455
-l don't know. lt just is.
-OK, OK. Listen up.

01:28:57.489 --> 01:28:59.855
Nobody's ever successfully
robbed this bank.

01:28:59.892 --> 01:29:01.689
l wish you would stop
saying that.

01:29:01.727 --> 01:29:04.161
The nearest freeway
is a mile away.

01:29:04.196 --> 01:29:05.925
We got to stick to the plan,
all right?

01:29:12.938 --> 01:29:14.906
l know y'all sick of wearing
them wigs.

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.100
What you got?

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:25.448
l got some other stuff
in the car.

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:26.952
Thank you, ladies.

01:29:32.392 --> 01:29:34.519
Cover my share until l finish
robbing this bank.

01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:38.221
Shoot, l'm broke.

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:40.894
Don't look over here. l am, too.

01:29:42.635 --> 01:29:44.296
Y'all...

01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:46.771
we don't have enough money
to pay the bill.

01:30:19.473 --> 01:30:20.633
We're in.

01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:29.142
Bullshit.

01:30:29.183 --> 01:30:31.311
-What the fuck is this?
-What are you doing?

01:30:32.254 --> 01:30:33.915
Trying to find some mood music.

01:30:34.856 --> 01:30:36.323
Fuck it. Radio.

01:30:46.334 --> 01:30:47.494
Look at that.

01:30:58.847 --> 01:31:01.645
Yo, what's up with that dress?
You going dancing or something?

01:31:03.953 --> 01:31:05.443
What you got?

01:31:05.488 --> 01:31:06.648
One for you...

01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:10.481
one for you.

01:31:10.526 --> 01:31:11.754
Check it out.

01:31:11.794 --> 01:31:13.762
There has been
a rash of these robberies...

01:31:13.796 --> 01:31:16.993
in the Los Angeles area
as far east as Pasadena...

01:31:17.033 --> 01:31:19.661
and as far north as
the San Fernando Valley.

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:23.505
They seem to know
the inner workings of each bank.

01:31:23.539 --> 01:31:27.407
Wigs and sunglasses
aid them in their disguise.

01:31:27.443 --> 01:31:30.003
Their m.o. is ''in and out.''

01:31:30.046 --> 01:31:31.843
Please do not be misled
by the fact...

01:31:31.881 --> 01:31:34.315
that these four bandits
are females.

01:31:35.151 --> 01:31:36.277
Once they get in here,
it's not going to be...

01:31:36.319 --> 01:31:38.048
''Stick them up
and give me your dough.''

01:31:38.087 --> 01:31:41.216
Your lives are going to be
in jeopardy, and that's a fact.

01:31:42.459 --> 01:31:43.983
These girls are the real deal.

01:31:45.128 --> 01:31:47.995
They've gotten real good at
casing the banks they knock off.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.297
Yes. Keith Weston, please.

01:31:52.336 --> 01:31:54.395
What the fuck are you doing?

01:31:54.438 --> 01:31:56.633
They know the intricacies
of bank security systems...

01:31:56.673 --> 01:31:59.403
and more importantly, they know
how to get around them.

01:31:59.443 --> 01:32:03.072
They may even have a contact
on the inside, so be aware.

01:32:03.113 --> 01:32:04.978
Obviously,
they don't appear this way...

01:32:05.015 --> 01:32:06.380
when they're on the street.

01:32:06.416 --> 01:32:07.815
This is Keith.

01:32:07.851 --> 01:32:08.977
Keith, listen to me.

01:32:09.019 --> 01:32:11.886
l need you to meet me
at the soul-food restaurant...

01:32:11.922 --> 01:32:14.187
in five minutes.

01:32:14.225 --> 01:32:15.385
Baby, why--

01:32:16.861 --> 01:32:18.123
l'm leaving right now.

01:32:20.031 --> 01:32:21.191
You be there.

01:32:26.237 --> 01:32:27.602
Come on. Let's do this.

01:32:30.274 --> 01:32:31.434
T.T.

01:32:33.544 --> 01:32:35.569
Detective Strode.

01:32:35.613 --> 01:32:36.773
You have a question?

01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:40.610
Are we done here?

01:32:41.619 --> 01:32:43.610
Actually,
we're just wrapping up.

01:32:43.655 --> 01:32:46.180
l'm going to leave
a copy of that tape here.

01:32:46.224 --> 01:32:47.816
-Thank you for your time.
-l'll show you out the back.

01:32:47.859 --> 01:32:49.020
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:51.052
Please be safe.
Please be careful.

01:32:57.503 --> 01:32:59.562
All right. Y'all do your thing.

01:33:17.556 --> 01:33:19.251
Now get down and don't move!

01:33:19.291 --> 01:33:21.851
-Get the fuck down!
-Get down, everybody!

01:33:21.894 --> 01:33:23.055
Don't move!

01:33:24.197 --> 01:33:26.597
-Get down!
-l said down!

01:33:27.767 --> 01:33:28.927
Get the fuck on the ground!

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:48.987

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:01.159

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:05.835
Can l get you anything?

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.033
No, thank you.

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:18.777
All units, silent alarm...

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:20.810
Downtown Federal building,
Seventh and Spring.

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:23.346
Proceed with extreme caution.
Suspects armed and dangerous.

01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:24.516
Can you believe this?

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:25.991
-God damn it!
-Shit!

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:30.396
Don't move!

01:34:35.604 --> 01:34:36.764
Let's make it!

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:42.302
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:34:42.344 --> 01:34:45.438
Don't move!
We got a minute and a half.

01:34:46.214 --> 01:34:49.047
You, down! You, don't move!

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:07.631
Get some more money.

01:35:11.574 --> 01:35:13.269
Don't be greedy. Let's go now!

01:35:13.309 --> 01:35:14.469
Get it now!

01:35:15.845 --> 01:35:17.073
Let's go.

01:35:18.281 --> 01:35:19.578
Don't move!

01:35:19.615 --> 01:35:20.980
Stay down!

01:35:21.017 --> 01:35:23.008
Hands out in front of you!

01:35:23.786 --> 01:35:26.277
Let's go!

01:35:27.256 --> 01:35:29.417
Don't move.
Don't make me hurt nobody.

01:35:29.458 --> 01:35:30.789
That's right,

01:35:30.827 --> 01:35:32.226

01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:40.735
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:42.238
Stay down! Don't move!

01:35:42.272 --> 01:35:43.671
Lita Newsome!

01:35:47.678 --> 01:35:49.043
Don't do this!

01:35:49.079 --> 01:35:51.741
Put the gun down. Put it down!

01:35:51.782 --> 01:35:53.272
Don't do this. Cleo!

01:35:54.718 --> 01:35:56.242
Fuck you.

01:35:59.957 --> 01:36:02.152

01:36:02.192 --> 01:36:03.659
And l'm sorry about

01:36:04.862 --> 01:36:07.262
l'm sorry he's dead,
l swear to God.

01:36:07.297 --> 01:36:08.491
But don't do this!

01:36:08.532 --> 01:36:10.523
Stevie was enough!

01:36:10.567 --> 01:36:12.262
He was enough.

01:36:14.104 --> 01:36:15.366
No more killing!

01:36:16.474 --> 01:36:17.634
Put the weapon down.

01:36:22.647 --> 01:36:23.807
Stevie was enough.

01:36:27.452 --> 01:36:28.885
Stony, put it down.

01:36:29.621 --> 01:36:30.781
Come on.

01:36:31.656 --> 01:36:32.816
There you go.

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:40.657
What are you doing?

01:36:55.881 --> 01:36:58.406
Motherfucker!

01:37:14.466 --> 01:37:15.831

Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go!

01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:37.349
Hurry up!

01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:40.354
Back it up, back it up!

01:38:03.818 --> 01:38:05.046
You'll be OK.

01:38:06.153 --> 01:38:07.484
Come on, Frankie!

01:38:07.521 --> 01:38:09.318
Damn! Damn! Damn!

01:38:09.357 --> 01:38:11.120
What happened?
What happened to her?

01:38:11.158 --> 01:38:13.149
We robbed this motherfucker,

01:38:13.194 --> 01:38:15.822
Frankie, listen. l need you

01:38:15.863 --> 01:38:18.354
and get us
to the hospital, OK? Go!

01:38:18.399 --> 01:38:19.627
This motherfucker's
not going to make it.

01:38:19.667 --> 01:38:21.100
We got to switch cars!

01:38:21.135 --> 01:38:22.295
You do what you got to do.

01:38:23.437 --> 01:38:24.597
You listen to me!

01:38:26.073 --> 01:38:27.472
You are gonna make it
through this.

01:38:27.508 --> 01:38:30.102
You understand me?
lt doesn't hurt.

01:38:30.144 --> 01:38:32.044
We've been through
a lot together, haven't we?

01:38:32.079 --> 01:38:33.876
-l'm OK.
-That's what l want to hear.

01:38:33.914 --> 01:38:35.940
l want to hear you're OK.

01:38:35.984 --> 01:38:37.679
Yes, l know you OK.

01:38:37.719 --> 01:38:39.914
Just hold on for me, baby, OK?

01:38:39.955 --> 01:38:42.822
Come on, Frankie, man,
drive this car!

01:38:56.671 --> 01:38:58.400
You better tell them
to hurry up.

01:39:00.842 --> 01:39:02.434
Come on, you guys!

01:39:06.615 --> 01:39:08.674
He gonna be mad at you.

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:13.213
You don't worry about Keith, OK?

01:39:14.857 --> 01:39:16.290
lf you're worried about
that tattoo...

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:17.952
you're going to get over
that hole.

01:39:21.764 --> 01:39:23.391
You know what l could use
right now?

01:39:25.034 --> 01:39:27.400
l could use a banana flambé.

01:39:29.205 --> 01:39:31.105
Remember
those banana flambés we had

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:32.903
that time at that restaurant?

01:39:34.143 --> 01:39:35.542
They were so good.

01:39:36.846 --> 01:39:38.040
Remember?

01:39:44.754 --> 01:39:46.586
Come on, Stony,
we got it started!

01:39:46.623 --> 01:39:48.716
Let's get her! Come on! Come on!

01:40:17.888 --> 01:40:20.858
-Sorry, T.T.
-We can't stay. Let's go!

01:40:45.984 --> 01:40:47.281
Come on, let's move it!

01:41:03.802 --> 01:41:05.667
Suspects are coming closer now.

01:41:05.704 --> 01:41:07.695
Police reports
indicate that the women...

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.173
are from Los Angeles.

01:41:09.208 --> 01:41:10.334
They've been identified...

01:41:10.376 --> 01:41:12.537
as Lita Newsome,
Francesca Sutton...

01:41:12.578 --> 01:41:15.206
Tisean Williams,
and Cleopatra Simms.

01:41:15.247 --> 01:41:17.181
You've just seen
these alleged bank robbers...

01:41:17.216 --> 01:41:20.708
avoid an L.A.P.D. blockade
on the First Street bridge.

01:41:20.753 --> 01:41:23.586
However, the police
are still on the suspects' tail.

01:41:23.622 --> 01:41:25.954
We'll try to follow the action
as best we can...

01:41:25.991 --> 01:41:27.982
You got to drive faster!

01:41:57.591 --> 01:42:00.059
Faster! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:42:06.968 --> 01:42:08.663
That was a close one.
Here we go again...

01:42:08.703 --> 01:42:11.001
the suspects
barely getting away this time.

01:42:11.038 --> 01:42:14.030
l don't see any police vehicles
in pursuit at the moment...

01:42:14.075 --> 01:42:16.043
but the L.A.P.D. helicopter
next to ours...

01:42:16.077 --> 01:42:18.045
has clearly got a bead on them.

01:42:18.079 --> 01:42:20.604
l just checked with the L.A.P.D.
liaison, by the way.

01:42:20.648 --> 01:42:23.879
He's reporting
that this 1962 Chevy lmpala...

01:42:26.587 --> 01:42:29.055
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:30.250
l'm going!

01:42:41.069 --> 01:42:42.297
l think l lost them.

01:42:42.337 --> 01:42:43.929
You lost them ! You're good.

01:42:46.908 --> 01:42:48.637
We have visual contact
with suspects' vehicle...

01:42:48.677 --> 01:42:49.974
on Second Street tunnel.

01:42:52.648 --> 01:42:53.979
-Shit!
-Damn!

01:42:54.916 --> 01:42:56.110
Damn it!

01:42:59.955 --> 01:43:01.047
What are you doing?

01:43:02.691 --> 01:43:04.249
-Come on.
-Fuck!

01:43:09.064 --> 01:43:11.055
OK, let's think.
Let's think. Let's think.

01:43:13.736 --> 01:43:15.226
-All right, get out.
-What?

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:20.468
Get out
and lean up against the wall...

01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:22.705
and in sixty seconds,
l want you to run that way.

01:43:22.745 --> 01:43:24.337
Cleo, fuck, no! Hell, no!

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.575
Stony, shut up!
We got to split up!

01:43:26.616 --> 01:43:28.083
We got to.

01:43:28.117 --> 01:43:30.551
Look, l'll catch up to y'all
later, l promise.

01:43:30.586 --> 01:43:33.282
-What about the money?
-Just hold on to it.

01:43:34.857 --> 01:43:36.085
Come on.

01:43:44.334 --> 01:43:45.494
Come on. Let's go.

01:43:55.179 --> 01:43:56.339
All right, motherfuckers.

01:43:57.014 --> 01:43:58.481
Suspects are on the move.

01:43:59.717 --> 01:44:01.446
You want it? Here it go.

01:44:03.654 --> 01:44:05.019
Here we go! Me and you!

01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:08.255
They're gonna ram us!

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:39.713
We got to dump these clothes.

01:44:50.268 --> 01:44:51.394
l love you.

01:44:51.436 --> 01:44:54.428
Oh, God. You be careful, OK?

01:45:13.692 --> 01:45:17.253
And now the police
are all over the suspects' tail.

01:45:17.296 --> 01:45:18.786
Ain't that your girls?

01:45:20.132 --> 01:45:21.292
Hell, yeah.

01:45:22.601 --> 01:45:24.330
Damn. That's fucked up.

01:45:32.546 --> 01:45:34.912
l just checked with the L.A.P.D.
liaison, by the way.

01:45:34.948 --> 01:45:36.313
He's reporting
that this 1962 Chevy...

01:45:36.349 --> 01:45:39.944
They through.
Helicopters and shit.

01:45:40.787 --> 01:45:42.550
Ain't no escapin' that shit.

01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:43.851
Get set!

01:45:44.891 --> 01:45:46.051
Hold your positions!

01:46:05.178 --> 01:46:06.942
Step out of your vehicle...

01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:08.505
with your hands in the air.

01:46:14.956 --> 01:46:16.651
Step out of your vehicle...

01:46:17.492 --> 01:46:19.187
keeping your hands in the air.

01:48:42.807 --> 01:48:43.967
We've just had...

01:48:46.544 --> 01:48:47.943
a horrible moment here.

01:48:49.914 --> 01:48:51.541
This is...

01:48:51.583 --> 01:48:54.643
our greatest fears
for what would happen today.

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.080
This is the most...

01:48:58.957 --> 01:49:01.290
tragic culmination
of the day's events.

01:49:04.563 --> 01:49:05.723
Damn.

01:49:21.013 --> 01:49:22.378
Dad, sit down.

01:49:43.336 --> 01:49:46.430
Freeze! Drop the bag! Get your
hands where we can see them !

01:49:46.473 --> 01:49:48.634
Slowly turn around
and drop your weapon!

01:49:48.675 --> 01:49:50.040
Get your hands up!

01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:57.710
Wait!

01:49:59.419 --> 01:50:01.478
Wait now. You wait, Waller!

01:50:02.789 --> 01:50:04.120
God damn it, you wait.

01:50:08.061 --> 01:50:10.326
Listen to me.
l'm taking it off here.

01:50:10.364 --> 01:50:12.559
l'm not carrying, OK?

01:50:14.869 --> 01:50:16.700
l got nothin'. You wait!

01:50:23.745 --> 01:50:24.905
Tisean is dead.

01:50:26.214 --> 01:50:27.613
Cleo is dead. She's dead.

01:50:29.016 --> 01:50:30.381
All you got is you...

01:50:31.352 --> 01:50:34.082
and now you got to save you.

01:50:34.122 --> 01:50:35.282
Do you understand me?

01:50:36.691 --> 01:50:38.522
Now, l need you on the ground.

01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:50.101
Wait!

01:50:50.139 --> 01:50:52.539
What's the procedure when
you got a gun at your head, huh?

01:50:53.242 --> 01:50:56.040
What's the fucking procedure...

01:50:56.078 --> 01:50:57.909
when you got a gun at your head?

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.017
lt's over.

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:57.199
We did it!

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:18.750
Cleo! Sit!

01:53:25.398 --> 01:53:28.060
Man, l remember
you was just a little scrub...

01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:30.432
always trying
to follow us around.

01:54:56.325 --> 01:54:58.316
Stony, l'm glad you're safe.

01:54:58.360 --> 01:54:59.554
