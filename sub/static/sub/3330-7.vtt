00:04.504 --> 00:06.705
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:11.176
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:12.745
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.747 --> 00:15.381
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:18.183
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:20.219
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:21.653
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.655 --> 00:23.122
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:25.057
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.658
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.363
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.565
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:36.035
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:38.637
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.639 --> 00:40.572
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.143
Orange, purple, tan, pink,
blue, blue, green.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.112
870!
Don't hit it so hard,
you'll mess up my wiring.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.481
I am going to slap it
like it owes me money.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.682
Speaking of which--
890.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.052
I can do it
with my eyes closed.

00:53.054 --> 00:56.822
I don't like you
when you're cocky.

00:56.824 --> 01:00.392
Hey! Picked up some
healthier fare for the fridge.

01:00.394 --> 01:04.129
You know, tuna, yogurt...

01:04.131 --> 01:05.297
Brain foods...

01:05.299 --> 01:06.832
So glad I try.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.167
Ka-ching!

01:08.169 --> 01:09.301
Come on.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.136
Should I ask?

01:11.138 --> 01:14.606
So it'll generate a thousand
sequence color pattern.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.275
And you're betting on whether
sylvester's memorized it.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.276
That's sane.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.343
Where's walter?

01:27.755 --> 01:31.123
Finally got that reseda client
to pay for their system upgrade.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.191
I sent them
a lawyer letter.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.425
We don't have a lawyer.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.760
They don't know that.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.662
What's this?

01:36.664 --> 01:40.199
This fellow's memory
of the maze pattern,

01:40.201 --> 01:41.867
Then I can do the
same for a human.
Losing me.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.435
I can transfer someone's
thoughts, consciousness,

01:43.437 --> 01:44.503
Their very
being forever.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.804
And, unfortunately,

01:45.806 --> 01:48.207
I happen to be working
with a stupid mouse. Hey!

01:48.209 --> 01:49.775
Are you doing this
for your sister?

01:49.777 --> 01:53.178
And for anybody else
whose body betrays them.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.348
(phone rings)
why would I name a mouse?

01:56.350 --> 01:58.517
'cause it's fun.
(phone rings)

01:58.519 --> 01:59.618
The phone's ringing!

01:59.620 --> 02:00.786
Toby:
We're gambling!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.754
This mouse is difficult
and stubborn.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.223
I'll call him cabe junior.
(answering machine plays)

02:04.225 --> 02:05.691
That's good.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.260
Remind me why
no digital voice mail.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.294
'cause you can't hack analog.

02:09.296 --> 02:13.265
Man: Um, hi, this message is
for paige dineen.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.501
I know it's been
a long time, paige,

02:15.503 --> 02:16.902
I got your info from the diner.

02:16.904 --> 02:20.172
I'd really like to see you guys.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.674
I'm at the same cell number.
No. No, no.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.809
Okay, bye.
No, no, no, no. No. No.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.445
The hell was that all about?

02:26.447 --> 02:28.447
Nothing. An acquaintance.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.549
You don't sprint down stairs
for an acquaintance.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.184
Who's drew?
Old friend.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.552
Bumped from acquaintance
to old friend in three seconds.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.553
Interesting.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.289
Look, it's really not important.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.291
You just put your hand
on your stomach.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.193
A subconscious protection marker
where you once carried a child.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.329
Is drew ralph's father?
I didn't know
ralph had a father.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.465
How exactly do
you think babies are made?
You know what I mean.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.301
Not that it's any
of your business,

02:49.303 --> 02:51.170
But ralph's dad is a minor
league baseball player...

02:51.172 --> 02:52.571
Great, a jock!

02:52.573 --> 02:54.339
We bounced around a lot,
team to team,

02:54.341 --> 02:56.675
And we agreed ralph
should have some stability.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.212
We settled in l.A. And drew was
gonna come out after his season.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.747
He got a job pitching
in mexico, then tampa,

03:01.749 --> 03:05.384
How long has it been
since he's seen ralph?
Seven years.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.385
Oh, that's great.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.386
Father of the year...

03:07.388 --> 03:08.554
Uh, excuse me, seven years.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.289
Drew's a difficult part
of my life

03:10.291 --> 03:15.227
And I'm certainly not dusting
it off with you guys,

03:15.229 --> 03:17.229
So there'll be no further
discussion on this issue.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.331
Paige, you want to know
if he's a good guy?

03:19.333 --> 03:22.534
If he digs into the flesh
with his fingernails--

03:22.536 --> 03:24.369
A primordial sign
of aggression.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.573
But if he peels it in one long
curl, that is a planner.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.675
He's right;
I'm very gentle with plums.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.844
Guys, we are not
giving him fruit.
Thank you.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.746
I can just hack his credit info,
see what he's been up to,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.848
If he's any risk to ralph.
Absolutely not.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.483
This isn't communal
child rearing.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.485
I'll decide if I call drew back.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.587
No one else.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.588
Cabe:
What's going on?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.690
Ralph's father's back in town.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.592
Oh, I see.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.428
Is that something you want
to discuss with everyone?
No.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.529
Cabe:
Then it's settled.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.297
Personal business
stays personal.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.566
Besides, we got some real
business to attend to.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.302
Three cons just escaped from
hamilton federal penitentiary.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.637
High-tech prison.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.807
When they called line-up,
they were gone.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.342
No tunnels,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.344
No compromised
fences, gone.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.712
They want you to determine

04:06.714 --> 04:08.480
How they beat their
state-of-the-art security.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.349
You want us to go
inside of a prison?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.350
Are you serious?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.584
Like a peek frean.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.986
The hell's
a peek frean?

04:13.988 --> 04:15.787
It's a cookie.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.389
Kind your grandma used
to give out?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.657
They had that slogan--

04:18.659 --> 04:21.627
"peek freans are
a very serious cookie."

04:23.496 --> 04:24.596
How young are you guys?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.864
How old are <i>you?</i>

04:25.866 --> 04:27.699
Let's get in the car.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.837
You know, eight
out of ten inmates had dads

04:31.839 --> 04:33.772
That were in and out
of the picture?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.941
Just saying.
Shut it, doc.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.010
I may be overstepping
my bounds...
You are.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.878
But a quick run of
potentialities yields few,

04:39.880 --> 04:42.514
If any, positive outcomes
from that phone call.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.416
An absent father returning
out of the blue

04:44.418 --> 04:45.951
Is fraught with peril.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.787
I know none of you have any idea
how inappropriate this all is,

04:48.789 --> 04:50.555
But it's off the charts.

04:51.758 --> 04:52.891
You've been quiet.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.960
No advice on how
to run my life?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.762
I don't know
anything about dads.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.400
Cabe:
<i>Welcome to prison.</i>

05:05.938 --> 05:07.606
Don't worry, son.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.909
You just tell me
how you hacked into nasa,

05:10.911 --> 05:13.645
And I promise everything
will be okay.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.985
(prisoners catcalling,
whistling)

05:28.961 --> 05:31.330
Should happy and
paige be here?

05:31.332 --> 05:33.398
They're talking
to you.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.969
Sergey antonovich and
roman volkovsky's cell.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.104
Russian outfit.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.873
Both doing a dime
for identity theft.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.408
Well, clearly scumbags,

05:43.410 --> 05:45.377
But they don't seem
to have the technical acumen

05:45.379 --> 05:46.645
To break out of this place.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.879
This one does.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.581
Here, let me look.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.751
Percy tate.

05:53.553 --> 05:54.820
You know the guy?

05:54.822 --> 05:55.721
Everybody does;
he's a "hacktivist."

05:55.723 --> 05:57.989
Borderline genius, iq-- 150.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.492
The sweet spot-- it's high
enough to be mentally gifted

06:00.494 --> 06:01.893
And low enough
to not be like us.

06:01.895 --> 06:05.063
The voter fraud tactics of a
couple congressional candidates.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.966
So he embedded a virus
into the electoral system.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.968
At the end of the election, he
reset all the votes down to zero

06:09.970 --> 06:13.572
With a message-- "do it again;
don't cheat this time."

06:13.574 --> 06:15.073
What the hell is the
robin hood of nerds

06:15.075 --> 06:16.975
Doing with russian
outfit guys?

06:16.977 --> 06:20.445
Was a model prisoner till he
disappeared without a clue.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.647
Now, our gates are wired
to a central system.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.116
We show no breach.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.751
Security film's clean.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.152
Are all your gates
under surveillance?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.687
All but...

06:28.689 --> 06:31.390
But one.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.658
This is it.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.827
It used to lead
to the loading dock,

06:35.829 --> 06:37.562
But not since an
upgrade 20 years ago.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.664
It ends five feet in.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.666
I don't think they went
through this gate.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.568
I think they just
used it to escape.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.636
Happy?

06:53.946 --> 06:55.013
Right here.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.081
It's been spackled.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.885
Matched the color
with toothpaste.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.022
I'm so turned on.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.926
This wire runs to the gate lock.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.060
And this is
a wireless transmitter

07:09.062 --> 07:11.963
That's been spliced into it.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.098
The escaped cons worked
maintenance duty?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.934
Cons with privileges
can move about

07:15.936 --> 07:17.202
During specific periods
during the day.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.938
Including work detail
and morning pt,

07:19.940 --> 07:20.939
When they broke out.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.041
You want to know
how they did it?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.676
When the prisoners returned
their supplies

07:24.678 --> 07:29.114
They knew that no cameras would
<i>be watching a defunct gate.</i>

07:29.116 --> 07:31.683
So they only needed a minute to
<i>get through that wall.</i>

07:31.685 --> 07:33.985
Happy: <i>They attach a transmitter</i>
<i>to catch a signal</i>

07:33.987 --> 07:36.621
<i>To open the gate, which is</i>
<i>then sent to a cell phone.</i>

07:36.623 --> 07:38.123
A transmitter is small.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.791
But a cell phone?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.060
Nothing that big could get
in or out of my prison.

07:42.062 --> 07:42.961
Except convicts.

07:42.963 --> 07:47.632
Hey, has this door been opened
anytime over the last few days?

07:47.634 --> 07:51.102
Antonovich dropped a can
of cleanser through the bars,

07:51.104 --> 07:52.971
And we opened it
to let him get it.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.239
You know, the gates
would only need

07:54.241 --> 07:56.074
To be opened once
to get the access signal.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.176
If the other gates <i>are</i> under
surveillance, they'd be seen.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.213
Not if their phone was
programmed with an emp device.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.982
Localized burst would disable
a camera for three seconds.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.251
Sylvester: That's enough time
to get through any prison gate

08:06.253 --> 08:07.619
And get out of camera range.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.054
I think I know
how they got the phone in.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.122
I'd like to go
outside now, please.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.999
(cell phone buzzing)

08:21.001 --> 08:23.101
Warden: This is
the field out here.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.004
Drew didn't get a return call,
so now he's e-mailing.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.939
Focus.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.842
Walter:
Warden, when was the last time
the cons had extended yard time?

08:30.844 --> 08:33.111
Three days ago,
cell-block baseball.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.681
How do you know that?
My dad made me play right field.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.951
The ball is usually hit
to the center or to the left.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.953
If a convict was receiving
contraband out here,

08:41.955 --> 08:43.121
Like a cell phone,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.223
He'd definitely want
to play right field,

08:45.225 --> 08:47.192
Because nobody pays attention
to the right fielder.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.061
So, they smuggled in
contraband during a game.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.764
Surely, you can't be serious.
Serious as a peek frean.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.099
And don't call me shirley.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.134
Bam! That's how you do it, cabe.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.869
Walter: It's easier than
you realize, warden.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.739
See, the russians are organized
crime, they have outside help.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.041
So, while everyone else
is watching the game,

09:03.043 --> 09:05.310
A bird flies 30 feet
above the yard.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.145
Except, it's not a bird,
it's an mav,

09:07.147 --> 09:09.581
A micro air vehicle.

09:09.583 --> 09:13.618
Now, black market drones go
for low five figures.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.320
And the drone
drops the phone

09:15.322 --> 09:16.888
Right into the right
fielder's glove.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.691
These guys like baseball,
just like drew.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.794
Did he ever play
in a penal league?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.096
Here you are.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.132
Surveillance of hamilton
penitentiary ball game

09:27.134 --> 09:28.667
Three days ago.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.801
How did you get that?

09:29.803 --> 09:30.902
Ah, it's
not that hard.

09:30.904 --> 09:31.903
Look! Right there.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.905
There's the drone.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.907
Maybe that's
just a bird.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.910
Toby: Well, that bird is taking
one heck of a dookie.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.179
Cabe:
I'll be damned.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.682
Whoever made
that drop wasn't far

09:43.684 --> 09:44.816
Outside these walls.

09:44.818 --> 09:48.253
I bet they stopped flying
that bird and just took off.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.323
Assuming a two-pound drone
with a lithium battery,

09:51.325 --> 09:53.825
12-inch wingspan,
six-knot winds,

09:53.827 --> 09:55.827
It would have glided to a stop

09:55.829 --> 09:58.997
Roughly 1.37 miles
southeast of here.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.365
Take sylvester, find that drone.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.634
Look, I don't care about
the location of the drone,

10:02.636 --> 10:03.868
I care about the
location of my convicts.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.170
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.272
Here's a satellite image
of one of the cons

10:07.274 --> 10:08.940
Running
by the tree line.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.942
I really don't want you
hacking into u.S. Satellites

10:10.944 --> 10:11.943
Without permission.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.745
I'm not; these are china's.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.213
Toby:
Hold on.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.649
Look at how that other guy
is grabbing percy.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.118
How much time did he have left?
Ten months.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.020
Why would he want to break out
now with short time left?

10:22.022 --> 10:24.022
Yeah, maybe he didn't want
to break out.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.390
He's got a funny way
of showing it.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.393
What if they forced him to?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.161
They needed him to escape.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.230
The odds are-- they need him
for something else.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.299
Otherwise, you would have
already found his corpse by now.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.668
With two jailbreaks,
one kidnapping.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.169
Let me see this.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.974
You know, percy tate's
highly intelligent

10:42.976 --> 10:44.943
And was vulnerable here.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.313
He was quite possibly
taken advantage of.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.349
Ralph's also
vulnerable,

10:51.351 --> 10:52.784
Like most child geniuses.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.152
I can see you're
getting to something.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.320
I was about
ralph's age

10:55.322 --> 10:56.921
When cabe suddenly
appeared in my life.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.157
My dad was a good man,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.760
But he never really
understood me.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.128
So cabe filled a void.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.430
But when things got
complicated between us,

11:05.432 --> 11:08.400
It was hard to bounce back.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.035
I get it.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.336
But I can handle it.
Okay?

11:14.940 --> 11:16.741
This would be
a tough situation

11:16.743 --> 11:19.210
If ralph were
a regular kid.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.379
We could look
into the guy.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.249
Ah, she told me not to.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.850
That's right.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.919
She told <i>you</i> not to.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.075
Sylvester:
Whoa, whoa, careful.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.142
Don't hurt birdroni.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.411
I didn't have
any pets growing up.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.312
(door opens)

11:54.314 --> 11:58.149
The bird wasn't on recon mode,
so there's no film to help us.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.484
But I did
study the code

11:59.486 --> 12:01.086
That percy used to
rig the election.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.487
It was able to change
vote tallies

12:02.489 --> 12:04.089
In the one-tenth of a second

12:04.091 --> 12:05.990
It took to digitally
transfer the data

12:05.992 --> 12:07.892
From the various districts
to the election commissioner.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.061
He expertly
exploited

12:10.063 --> 12:12.397
A miniscule point
of failure.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.099
He's quite bright.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.401
Make sure you get him
to sign your yearbook

12:16.403 --> 12:17.469
When we arrest him.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.471
You see?
That is the problem.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.873
Percy tate's a brilliant mind,
and you mock him.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.376
He's a criminal, who clearly
masterminded this breakout.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.746
He's mentally enabled,
and I think he may have been

12:27.748 --> 12:29.080
Taken advantage of
because of it.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.049
I'm amazed that geniuses
can even get duped.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.050
Walter:
Easily.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.451
We become so focused,

12:33.453 --> 12:35.220
We lose peripheral vision,

12:35.222 --> 12:38.256
And it's on the outskirts
where ulterior motives lie.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.390
Geniuses
state facts,

12:39.392 --> 12:41.392
So we assume others
state facts, too.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.494
Walter:
If you become ostracized

12:42.496 --> 12:44.796
From an early age
for being different,

12:44.798 --> 12:47.098
Or if someone targets you
because they have
something to gain,

12:47.100 --> 12:48.900
You don't see their motives
until it's too late.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.469
After a while, it starts
to affect your core self.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.104
You trust no one.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.173
Grow up to be distant...
Like walter.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.341
...Or scared of
your own shadow...

12:56.343 --> 12:57.008
Like me.

12:57.010 --> 12:57.909
...Angry...

12:57.911 --> 13:01.079
...Or a condescending jerk.
Like toby.
Toby.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.213
Where the hell's the doc anyway?

13:03.350 --> 13:07.118
Not all smart people
are saints, o'brien.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.454
Stop letting that genius-sized
chip on your shoulder

13:09.456 --> 13:10.455
Cloud your judgment.
(phone ringing)

13:10.457 --> 13:12.524
Gallo.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.395
Really?

13:18.497 --> 13:22.534
Well, "gentleman genius"
percy tate and his pals

13:22.536 --> 13:26.237
Just carjacked a ride and
sent two guys to the hospital.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.438
Let's move.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.140
Toby:
â™ª another round

13:29.142 --> 13:31.843
â™ª she sells them
whiskey and wine â™ª

13:31.845 --> 13:33.344
â™ª the sailors say, brandy

13:33.346 --> 13:35.880
â™ª you're a fine girl

13:35.882 --> 13:39.017
â™ª what a good wife
you would be... â™ª

13:39.019 --> 13:41.853
Sprinkles!

13:41.855 --> 13:43.855
Sprinkles...
Hey.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.124
Excuse me,
have you seen my dog?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.592
No, sorry, I haven't.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.494
See, he's a teacup chihuahua.
You could easily miss him.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.862
That's probably why
I didn't see him.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.463
He just took off,

13:52.465 --> 13:55.433
And I know a coyote is
gonna swallow him whole.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.402
I'm sick over this.
Well, I'm sure he'll turn up.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.870
Could you drive me
around the neighborhood

13:58.872 --> 13:59.871
To look for sprinkles?

13:59.873 --> 14:00.872
No, sorry.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.307
I got someplace to be.
Oh...

14:02.309 --> 14:03.374
Excuse me.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.849
(car engine starts)
condescending jerk.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.519
Cabe: There's the security
footage of the carjacking.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.522
Percy's car was found
in the woods a mile from here--

14:17.524 --> 14:20.024
Caught a screw in a tire.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.626
Odds are it's the getaway ride,

14:21.628 --> 14:23.361
Stashed in the woods
near the prison.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.996
Walter: Well, that's why
they did this carjacking.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.231
They needed a
new vehicle.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.166
Happy:
Civilian clothes, weapons...

14:28.168 --> 14:30.602
I bet that duffel bag has
food, water, money in it.

14:30.604 --> 14:31.903
And a laptop.

14:31.905 --> 14:32.971
For what
other reason

14:32.973 --> 14:34.439
Would percy
still be alive

14:34.441 --> 14:36.474
Other than they have some
need for his coding skills?

14:36.476 --> 14:39.344
At whatever it is
their larger plan is

14:39.346 --> 14:40.879
As soon as they're settled.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.981
If there's a bigger plan
at play here, what is it?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.515
Happy:
Hold on.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.884
Rewind that.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.887
Look at percy's hands.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.624
He's messing with something
behind his back.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.602
He took this number five
from the price sign

15:04.604 --> 15:06.170
And stuck it next to the "x."

15:06.172 --> 15:08.273
And he pushed it
all the way to the right

15:08.275 --> 15:09.407
From the middle of the rack.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.508
Why?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.509
Okay, the "x" is roman for ten,

15:11.511 --> 15:16.281
He wasn't pushing it right,
he was pushing it east.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.582
I-15.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.683
I-15 east!

15:18.685 --> 15:19.684
You're reaching.

15:19.686 --> 15:24.289
He had seconds to leave
a message... He did.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.024
Or he just bumped
into the display.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.559
Let's just assume the guy
with the 197 iq is right.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.061
We could use

15:30.063 --> 15:31.930
Amber alerts on the 15

15:31.932 --> 15:33.598
To send a coded message
so he can contact us.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.133
This guy is borderline genius.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.035
We make it too hard,
he won't get it.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.137
We make it too easy,
we're gonna get responses

15:39.139 --> 15:41.005
From every math geek
out for a ride.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.442
Cabe: Well, you guys do
whatever it is you gotta do,

15:44.444 --> 15:45.610
But I'm gonna need
actionable intelligence

15:45.612 --> 15:47.345
That percy tate is
trying to contact you

15:47.347 --> 15:48.613
Before I send in personnel.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.416
That's protocol,
and I'm following it.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.420
Cabe:
I had to follow protocol.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.587
We had to hold him

15:56.589 --> 15:58.723
Until determination
he wasn't a threat.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.991
But three days?

15:59.993 --> 16:01.125
Well, it wasn't ideal.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.528
But now we know
he's just a curious boy,

16:03.530 --> 16:04.696
Not a bad one.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.966
Truth is, more we got
to know each other,

16:07.968 --> 16:09.968
I realized he's
pretty amazing.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.135
So amazing,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.037
I think he earned something.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.378
Go ahead.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.151
Father: Isn't that
one of the damn things

16:27.153 --> 16:29.187
That started all
this trouble?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.089
Well, I think he'll be
more careful moving forward.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.223
Right, kiddo?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.491
Yes, sir.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.727
On one condition:

16:35.729 --> 16:39.097
You use that to stay
in touch with me.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.531
I'd hate to think

16:40.533 --> 16:42.567
That this would the last time
I'd see someone like you.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.206
Sylvester:
Anything?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.241
Walter.
Any-anything?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.210
Um, made the alerts look like
they're malfunctioning,

16:52.212 --> 16:53.611
But no response yet.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.747
Paige:
There's a message

16:55.749 --> 16:59.417
There's a pattern mimicking
pascal's triangle.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.252
Each number is the sum
of the two numbers above,

17:01.254 --> 17:03.621
Except for the edges,
which are all ones.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.490
If you shade in all
the odd numbers,

17:05.492 --> 17:07.425
What you're left
with is an address

17:07.427 --> 17:08.659
For an online bulletin board
that is secure,

17:08.661 --> 17:10.461
Which he can
reach us at for help.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.796
After passing a few signs,

17:11.798 --> 17:13.798
A coder like percy
should pick up on it.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.533
How could he miss it?

17:26.145 --> 17:28.679
I got general background
information on mr. Drew baker.

17:28.681 --> 17:29.680
Great.
What'd you find?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.115
Lots.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.350
From a personality standpoint,

17:32.352 --> 17:34.052
He displayed
just moderate empathy

17:34.054 --> 17:37.555
And when I made
physical contact with him,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.290
He defaulted
to a combative stance

17:39.292 --> 17:40.458
Instead of one of defense.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.293
He might have a short temper.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.394
Where'd you touch him?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.296
His lips.
Very softly.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.298
I touched his arm, potato-head.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.666
And not for nothing,
but he was

17:48.668 --> 17:50.068
A little judgmental

17:50.070 --> 17:51.502
When I told him I had
a teacup chihuahua.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.071
He's a macho putz.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.606
Even worse,
background check shows

17:55.608 --> 17:57.308
He plead guilty to
a battery charge

17:57.310 --> 18:00.178
12 years ago, before
he knew paige.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.546
I couldn't find
the details online,

18:01.548 --> 18:02.580
But I'm still
looking.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.581
Battery?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.416
And he wants to see ralph?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.851
This guy, he
seemed impulsive.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.386
I wouldn't put it
past him coming here.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.288
(door bangs)

18:11.623 --> 18:12.790
I'm always right.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.631
Can I help you?
Drew:
Hi... Yeah.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.567
I'm looking for paige.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.103
Drew?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.171
Walter, I got it.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.873
Why don't you come over here?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.108
Thanks.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.713
Makes me nervous.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.281
Paige:
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:37.283 --> 18:38.616
I'm sorry.
It's inappropriate,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.885
And I'm only in town
a couple of days...

18:40.887 --> 18:42.253
You wanted to see the
child you abandoned?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.488
I don't blame you for hating me.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.689
Has nothing to do with me.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.756
It has to do with my son.

18:45.758 --> 18:46.791
Our son.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.226
My son.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.360
Fair enough.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.828
Look, I know the damage
that I caused

18:50.830 --> 18:52.763
Because I just wanted
to run around,

18:52.765 --> 18:55.366
Play ball like a child,
act like a child...

18:55.368 --> 18:57.368
But baseball
is going away.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.370
I'm a 31-year-old
washed-up reliever.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.508
Only good thing
I did in my life...

19:03.510 --> 19:05.877
I deserted.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.345
I just...

19:07.347 --> 19:11.782
That little baby
that I used to hold.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.319
Well, he is not little anymore.

19:17.256 --> 19:20.424
And he is special

19:20.426 --> 19:22.426
In more ways than
you could imagine.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.661
I know you've
had your hands full

19:23.663 --> 19:25.663
With his developmental delays,

19:25.665 --> 19:26.898
I just...

19:26.900 --> 19:28.499
(sylvester clears throat)

19:28.501 --> 19:30.868
Would your guest
like some fruit?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.403
Excuse me?
He's fine.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.571
He doesn't want fruit.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.239
Come on, babe ruth,
take a peach.

19:35.908 --> 19:36.741
I'm good,

19:36.743 --> 19:38.576
Thank you.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.644
Okay.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.384
You were always
an amazing mother.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.919
So whatever you decide to do...

19:47.921 --> 19:49.287
That's the right move.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.589
Just know my
intentions are good,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.191
And I just want ralph to know

19:53.193 --> 19:54.392
That I never stopped
thinking about him.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.760
Walter:
It's percy!

19:55.762 --> 19:58.863
The kidnappers must
have him on the computer!

19:58.865 --> 20:00.431
You need to
leave now.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.499
What do you guys do here?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.367
I need to take
care of this,

20:03.369 --> 20:05.369
So I will let you
know what I decide.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.471
Toby:
Where is he?

20:07.473 --> 20:08.806
Walter:
"312 rural route 9.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.274
Help."

20:10.276 --> 20:11.509
That's way out past newhall.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.443
Not much is out there.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.544
Except
percy tate.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.813
But like you said,
someone else could've

20:15.815 --> 20:17.415
Cracked the code
and is messing with us.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.883
Cabe wants
"actionable intelligence."

20:18.885 --> 20:20.418
So we'll confirm he's
there, then call cabe.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.586
How do we do that?

20:21.588 --> 20:22.820
We can't just walk up and knock

20:22.822 --> 20:24.355
On the door
of their safe house.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.590
We won't have to.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.527
No, no. Birdroni? No.

20:32.998 --> 20:35.666
Looks like the make and model
of the car they stole.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.968
I can't get
a good look.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.503
Oh...

20:45.611 --> 20:47.745
You need to swoop down
past the window on an angle.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.447
You can't let 'em get
a good look at that thing.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.515
I know.
Why are you flying it so low?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.384
I'm just getting the hang of it.
You're scared
it's gonna crash

20:53.386 --> 20:55.253
And hurt itself.
It's not a real pet.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.420
I know what I'm doing, toby.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.655
Just let
me do it.
No.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.723
Happy built this for me.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.291
Let... Go...
Of...

21:00.293 --> 21:00.725
Guys...

21:00.727 --> 21:01.792
Stop it!

21:04.529 --> 21:05.696
Sylvester:
Oh, no!

21:05.698 --> 21:07.398
I know I've said
this before,

21:07.400 --> 21:08.466
But not good.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.503
(automatic gunfire)

21:14.439 --> 21:16.607
Stay down.
They don't see us.

21:31.056 --> 21:34.592
Well, this is gonna be
a tough one to explain.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.967
You like those encryptions
I sent you last month?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.503
Only the last few
were difficult.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.673
It took the navy's best
cryptographers weeks

21:48.675 --> 21:50.308
To do what you did in days.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.810
I got something else
I'd like you to do.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.079
Trying to develop a
new tracking software

21:55.081 --> 21:57.381
To drop aid packages
to refugees.

21:57.383 --> 21:59.050
You think that's something
you want to take a crack at?

21:59.052 --> 22:00.351
You want my help?

22:00.353 --> 22:02.019
For a real project?

22:02.021 --> 22:04.488
I'll set it up.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.425
You want to tell me
how you got that shiner?

22:07.427 --> 22:09.660
It's just bullies.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.495
They don't like me

22:11.497 --> 22:13.597
'cause I'm different.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.566
They don't like you
because they're scared

22:15.568 --> 22:17.034
Of what you can do.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.506
What do you say I teach you
a few things before I go?

22:23.875 --> 22:24.975
Stand up, get on your feet.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.610
Come on, up.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.778
Get on your feet.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.847
Keep your feet under you.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.782
Get your hands up like this.

22:31.784 --> 22:32.950
All right?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.452
When they come at you,

22:34.454 --> 22:37.121
You're gonna block and counter.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.357
All right? Rule number one.

22:39.359 --> 22:40.524
Always go for the nose.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
Hands up.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.095
You ready? Here it comes.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.430
There you go, perfect.

22:46.432 --> 22:49.633
You got to be more
careful, walter.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.936
You guys could've
been killed.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.439
All right, it didn't go
according to plan,

22:55.441 --> 22:56.941
But I was right
about the kidnapping.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.642
Now's not the time
to poke the bear.

22:58.644 --> 22:59.810
This russian outfit

22:59.812 --> 23:01.846
Has safe houses all over l.A.

23:01.848 --> 23:05.649
These guys are in the wind now.
Sylvester: Uh, walter?

23:05.651 --> 23:07.518
Seems when birdroni went
through the window,

23:07.520 --> 23:08.886
He smashed percy's computer,

23:08.888 --> 23:12.156
But he caught an image
of the laptop.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.792
That is the code that percy used
to hack the election,

23:14.794 --> 23:16.127
But he's changing it.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.461
He's got
an account-siphon router

23:17.463 --> 23:18.696
With a foreign prefix.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.131
Which means...
Which means

23:20.133 --> 23:21.866
The russians are making him
modify his software,

23:21.868 --> 23:23.701
And part of it has to do
with sending money overseas,

23:23.703 --> 23:25.703
But I can't tell where
just from looking at this.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.737
I'll have
the treasury department

23:26.739 --> 23:27.738
Trace this account number.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.106
Percy should be traced as well.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.409
After what happened here,
the convicts must know

23:31.411 --> 23:33.043
That he's the one that tipped
their location.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.645
He won't be able
to contact us again.

23:34.647 --> 23:35.980
They'll be watching him
like a hawk.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.815
So then we'll be watching them.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.583
If we can capture
the digital I.D.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.152
From when percy im'd us,
we should be able

23:41.154 --> 23:42.887
To track it
to his computer's ip address.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.522
We can hack his webcam
and watch him,

23:44.524 --> 23:46.557
And maybe we can get a clue
as to where he is

23:46.559 --> 23:47.825
Or what they're forcing him
to do.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.527
It's worth a shot.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.562
Let's do it.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.931
Paige:
The sitter will be here soon,

23:53.933 --> 23:55.533
But I wanted to talk
to you first.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.600
Okay?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.936
It's shapes made out of shapes.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.572
It's squares squared.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.474
Wow.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.509
That's very cool.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.611
Sweetheart,

24:07.613 --> 24:09.613
What do you remember
about your father?

24:09.615 --> 24:10.748
He was tall.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.916
He liked his toast burnt,

24:11.918 --> 24:13.951
And he left to see a movie.

24:13.953 --> 24:14.985
What?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.454
When we left for l.A.,

24:16.456 --> 24:18.189
He said he'd catch up
with us later.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.924
He was just going
to see a movie.

24:19.926 --> 24:23.861
There were 12 theaters
within 20 miles of our home.

24:23.863 --> 24:27.565
48 screens, 227 showings.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.734
Average run time-- 112 minutes.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.974
Maybe he just wanted to stay
and see more movies.

24:41.012 --> 24:43.047
Toby:
I know you're gonna tell me

24:43.049 --> 24:44.682
To "shut it" again,
but watching a kid learn

24:44.684 --> 24:46.717
That daddy's come back
has got to be hurting you.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.621
I'm not your patient, doc.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.189
But you are my friend.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.124
Here.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.559
While checking on drew today,

24:55.561 --> 24:56.994
I also hacked social services,

24:56.996 --> 24:58.629
Pulled your records.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.631
There is some photos in there

25:00.633 --> 25:02.900
Of your dad, your mother.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.069
My mother died
during childbirth.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.204
You have the wrong paperwork.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.807
Your dad put photos in there in
case you ever pulled your file.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.509
I'm a decent hacker.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.644
I could've gotten this
myself if I wanted.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.679
But    left <i>me.</i>

25:15.681 --> 25:17.515
I am not chasing him.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.583
I don't need him.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.663
I love you, ralph.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.664
Hi, ralph.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.865
I'll see you
when I get home.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.634
Hi.
Hi.

25:36.636 --> 25:37.635
Drive carefully.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.702
Okay.

25:39.671 --> 25:42.673
Bye!
Bye.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.608
Hey.
Hey.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.679
Uh...
(clears throat)

25:48.681 --> 25:50.314
I don't want
to butt in, but, um,

25:50.316 --> 25:52.550
Can I at least ask
how he took it?

25:52.552 --> 25:54.552
I couldn't tell him.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.719
Not yet.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.655
That's prudent.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.557
Maybe the best course is
to never tell him.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.724
What happened to not butting in?

26:00.726 --> 26:01.859
Hey, hey, hey.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.561
People change a lot
over seven years.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.262
You don't even
know drew anymore.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.932
He might not be
this sweet baseball player

26:07.934 --> 26:09.667
From st. Louis. He may be

26:09.669 --> 26:11.569
A danger.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.704
How do you know
he's from st. Louis?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.606
Um...

26:15.608 --> 26:16.907
You looked into him?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.642
Yeah, we did,
and be thankful that we did,

26:18.644 --> 26:20.244
Because he has a conviction
for battery.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.979
"we"?

26:22.914 --> 26:24.648
That's it.
Paige. Paige.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.816
No, no.
No, hold on.

26:25.818 --> 26:26.917
Paige.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.852
Hey!

26:28.854 --> 26:30.921
Listen up.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.825
I don't remember any of you
in the delivery room with me,

26:34.827 --> 26:37.928
Or at the e.R. When ralph
had whooping cough,

26:37.930 --> 26:40.965
Or at a single pta meeting,
but somehow you all

26:40.967 --> 26:42.199
Have an equal vote.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.601
Hell, no.

26:43.603 --> 26:44.702
Sylvester:
We were just worried.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.103
We love ralph.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.339
We're only trying to
properly analyze the situation.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.140
This isn't an
analytical issue.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.709
It's emotional,

26:51.711 --> 26:52.843
Which means you're ill-equipped.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.678
You're too involved.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.913
You are not ralph's father,

26:55.915 --> 26:57.781
And whether he meets his dad
is my decision.

26:57.783 --> 26:58.882
Sylvester:
Holy smokes!

26:58.884 --> 27:00.184
Guys, it's percy!

27:00.186 --> 27:01.285
It's percy, guys.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.753
I tracked his im handle.

27:03.688 --> 27:04.788
Turn the webcam light off

27:04.790 --> 27:06.156
So the russians can't see it.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.791
Start recording.
Oh, god.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.293
Cabe: What are they saying?
Sylvester: No sound.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.363
Mic must have broken when
birdroni smashed percy's laptop.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.632
Happy: If we could hear them, we
might get a clue where they are.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.634
Oh, zoom in on that chip bag.

27:17.702 --> 27:18.636
Look at it.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.170
The polypropylene film

27:20.172 --> 27:22.773
Is vibrating from the sound
waves of the convict shouting.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.174
I know what you're thinking.
I think we all do.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.777
I'll prep
the wave imaging software.

27:29.715 --> 27:33.384
I replaced them
with healthier choices.
Toby: Okay.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.019
Cabe: What the hell
are you guys doing?

27:35.021 --> 27:36.754
Do you hear the gravel
in that voice?

27:36.756 --> 27:37.755
You're our guy.

27:37.757 --> 27:38.922
Wait a minute,
I'm nobody's guy

27:38.924 --> 27:40.791
Until I know
what the hell's going on.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.826
Russians, from a historical
genetic standpoint,

27:42.828 --> 27:45.129
Have more elastic soft tissue
from folic acid deficiency.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.430
A thousand years of vodka
and cigarettes

27:46.432 --> 27:50.668
The result is long vocal cords
and deep voices.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.835
You're our closest vocal match.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.804
You'll say the phonetic alphabet

27:53.806 --> 27:54.838
Near that bag,

27:54.840 --> 27:56.674
And these sensors will record

27:56.676 --> 27:59.810
The ripple waves on the bag
that correspond with each sound.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.278
Walter: Now, we'll compare
them to the waves

28:01.280 --> 28:03.080
Sylvester's software
picks up from the film

28:03.082 --> 28:04.848
On percy's bag.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.717
And when the waves match,
we'll know the sound

28:06.719 --> 28:08.185
Being said on film

28:08.187 --> 28:09.787
Even though we can't hear it.

28:09.789 --> 28:10.821
You got it?

28:10.823 --> 28:11.922
Does it really matter?

28:11.924 --> 28:13.957
No. Now start.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.726
A.

28:15.728 --> 28:16.927
B.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.730
C.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.831
What are you doing?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.199
It's not abc, it's phonetics.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.134
Ah-a-eh, b-beh-buh, like that.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.869
All right, take it easy.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.806
It's my first time yelling
at a bag of chips.

28:28.808 --> 28:29.940
A.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.008
Ah, eh.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.743
Toby:
Good job, cabe.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.078
It's working; keep going.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.413
B, buh...
A moment while cabe finishes up?

28:36.415 --> 28:37.748
Yeah.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.016
C.

28:39.018 --> 28:42.252
Not that I need to explain
anything to you,

28:42.254 --> 28:44.822
But drew was pitching in toledo,
and he nailed a batter

28:44.824 --> 28:45.989
Who had homered off him earlier.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.291
He broke the guy's forearm.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.293
Prosecutors brought
charges to get some press,

28:49.295 --> 28:50.894
And drew took a plea.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.196
That's the battery charge.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.865
I'm a little overprotective
of ralph,

28:54.867 --> 28:57.167
Which I'm sure you understand.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.336
Look, for what's it worth,
I am gonna tell drew no.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.739
I think it's too confusing
for ralph right now.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.073
Maybe when he's older.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.908
It's your decision.

29:04.910 --> 29:05.743
Sylvester:
The software matched

29:05.745 --> 29:07.044
Cabe's waves to the waves

29:07.046 --> 29:09.446
On percy's bag.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.781
It couldn't pick up everything,

29:10.783 --> 29:13.150
But we got an "s," an "o,"

29:13.152 --> 29:15.753
A "c," a "k,"

29:15.755 --> 29:17.421
"sock."

29:17.423 --> 29:19.156
"change."

29:19.158 --> 29:20.891
"sock change."

29:20.893 --> 29:22.292
What the hell does that mean?
Wait.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.428
Percy's election code
took advantage

29:24.430 --> 29:26.964
Of a tenth of a second gap
in vote reporting,

29:26.966 --> 29:30.367
And the cons are forcing him
to change it to siphon money.

29:30.369 --> 29:33.904
Could he be tweaking it to
exploit the split-second gap

29:33.906 --> 29:37.908
From when a stock price is set
to when it's publicly posted?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.143
Sock change, stock exchange.

29:39.145 --> 29:44.114
If this virus code gets uploaded
to the stock exchange server...

29:44.116 --> 29:45.916
They could trade stocks on price
data before anybody has it.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.217
They could make billions

29:47.219 --> 29:48.852
With no one ever knowing,

29:48.854 --> 29:49.953
But why do all this now?

29:49.955 --> 29:51.221
Quick google
on the exchange software

29:51.223 --> 29:54.558
Shows a major upgrade
for next month.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.561
Percy's code wouldn't work
when that happened.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.396
No one who's planning
something like this

29:59.398 --> 30:00.831
Leaves witnesses behind.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.267
Percy is dead the minute
he finishes that code.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.135
He needs to know we found him.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.236
The russkies ain't looking.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.471
Flash that cam light.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.974
Toby:
There.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.309
His eyes locked in on the light.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.378
They're not looking,
you jackass.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.446
Tell us where you are.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.822
Sweet baby jane,
is that morse code?

30:24.824 --> 30:25.856
You know morse code?

30:25.858 --> 30:27.291
How old are <i>you?</i>

30:27.293 --> 30:30.828
Vandekarp...

30:30.830 --> 30:32.362
Farm.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.965
Building "s"!

30:34.967 --> 30:35.999
Let's go.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.302
(phone rings)
hold a beat.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.438
Just got a text from
the treasury department.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.140
They ran a trace
on that foreign account.

30:43.142 --> 30:46.109
It's only in percy's name.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.512
What does that mean?
It means that percy
was planning

30:48.514 --> 30:50.280
On ripping off the russians
this whole time.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.416
He's not as innocent
as we thought.

30:52.418 --> 30:57.120
He has a code that can steal
billions with no one knowing,

30:57.122 --> 30:58.555
But in a month it's useless,

30:58.557 --> 31:00.858
So he knows he has to break
out of prison now,

31:00.860 --> 31:05.095
To get a phone smuggled in,
a getaway car, a safe house.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.030
He needs the russians.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.932
So he breaks out
with them,

31:08.934 --> 31:10.167
Sets up his
get-rich-quick scheme,

31:10.169 --> 31:11.602
And figures
he'll just do something

31:11.604 --> 31:15.272
Like stick a screw in the tire
of the getaway ride.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.007
Enough to get the cops
on their trail.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.942
We played
right into his hands.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.444
Once he gets caught,
he plays innocent,

31:20.446 --> 31:22.012
Says he was forced to run,

31:22.014 --> 31:23.313
Maybe gets an extra year.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.015
He gets out,

31:25.017 --> 31:26.550
He's got a fortune overseas.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.085
But his plan was to be captured,

31:28.087 --> 31:29.887
Not almost captured.

31:29.889 --> 31:32.656
So after we almost nabbed him
at the safe house,

31:32.658 --> 31:34.391
The russians knew
he tipped us off.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.960
They beat the truth out of him,

31:36.962 --> 31:38.996
And now his last act on earth

31:38.998 --> 31:40.931
Is gonna be to make
those guys rich.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.433
Walter, does that
sound right to you?

31:49.073 --> 31:51.608
Cabe: Walter,
are you still there, son?

31:51.610 --> 31:55.045
I know that's my software
they're using to drop bombs,

31:55.047 --> 31:56.914
Not aid packages.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.682
It'll kill thousands
of innocents.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.918
I didn't know that was
the endgame, son.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.119
I swear.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.125
Yeah, it sounds right to me.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.127
He deceived us.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.495
He took advantage of us.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.097
Everything that normals
usually do to geniuses.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.234
I thought
he was one of us.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.236
I want to nail this guy.

32:24.109 --> 32:28.111
To building "s." your
men will hit the north.

32:28.113 --> 32:31.515
It's a silent maneuver in case
they have police scanners.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.250
So comms off.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.519
We'll drive halfway there,
then we'll hoof it

32:35.521 --> 32:37.087
So they don't
hear our approach.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.655
Copy that.

32:41.259 --> 32:44.227
Target's 800 yards on
the other side of the compound.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.429
So you'll be safe here.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.431
See you when
we got the bad guys.

32:47.433 --> 32:48.966
My team, with me!

32:48.968 --> 32:51.068
It looks like percy's
getting close to finishing

32:51.070 --> 32:53.136
That code for them.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.404
He's morse-coding again.

32:54.406 --> 32:59.109
"near... Done.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.210
Selp?"

33:02.080 --> 33:03.313
Oh, my god, "s" is three dots;

33:03.315 --> 33:04.648
"h" is four dots.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.084
I sent cabe to building "s"
instead of building "h"!

33:07.086 --> 33:09.052
Oh...
Hey, cabe!

33:09.054 --> 33:11.254
He's going to the wrong side
of the compound.

33:11.256 --> 33:11.755
Call him.

33:11.757 --> 33:12.756
We can't.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.559
Once percy sends that code
to the stock exchange,

33:15.561 --> 33:16.560
He's as good as dead.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.228
We gotta get him out of there.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.263
We're not putting
ourselves in danger

33:20.265 --> 33:22.132
For someone who's been
playing us this whole time.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.300
Walter:
We're gonna save him

33:23.302 --> 33:24.568
Because I want the satisfaction

33:24.570 --> 33:26.236
Of looking him in the eyes
when he's cuffed.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.171
Let him know:
The people he manipulated?

33:28.173 --> 33:30.240
They're the ones who are
sending him back inside.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.409
How do we rescue a man
being held by armed russians

33:32.411 --> 33:34.277
In an abandoned dairy farm
outside camarillo?

33:34.279 --> 33:35.412
Toby:
You have no idea
how many times

33:35.414 --> 33:36.646
I've been asked that question.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.751
Guys, building "h" is close.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.252
Follow me, follow me.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.561
Okay, happy, see if you can get
any gas out of that tractor.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.331
Paige...

33:54.333 --> 33:56.066
Find her something
to collect it in.

34:01.239 --> 34:02.339
You got time to fill me in?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.641
The farm was built
in the '20s.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.177
Means old knob
and tube wiring,

34:07.179 --> 34:08.245
So no grounding conductor.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.480
Now, if I target concentrated

34:10.482 --> 34:13.483
Micro-frequency waves--
which this remote emits--

34:13.485 --> 34:15.318
To the second floor
circuit breaker,

34:15.320 --> 34:16.753
Then I can cause it
to short out.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.255
But I will need
an accelerant.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.523
Which I almost
have for you.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.191
Even if we get
a fire going

34:21.193 --> 34:23.827
To flush them out,
they have guns.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.529
Then so will we.
I have an idea.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.699
Doc,

34:29.701 --> 34:31.134
Come with me
and bring your laptop.

34:35.274 --> 34:38.241
I should be getting
some short-circuiting

34:38.243 --> 34:40.343
And smoke through
the circuit breaker by now.

34:42.647 --> 34:44.281
Can't take my hands
off the remote control,

34:44.283 --> 34:46.149
So I'm gonna need
one of you to throw

34:46.151 --> 34:47.317
That accelerant
through the window.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.852
Hurry.
Me?

34:48.854 --> 34:50.353
I couldn't hit a donkey's ass
with a banjo.

34:50.355 --> 34:51.354
You played baseball.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.389
I played right field.

34:58.663 --> 34:59.796
Are you serious?

34:59.798 --> 35:01.264
As a peek frean.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.800
Please.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.135
You can just let me go.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.436
No one will know.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.305
Shut up and finish!

35:08.307 --> 35:11.374
Sylvester, this is your
chance to show your dad

35:11.376 --> 35:12.809
He was wrong to stick
you in right field.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.177
I know you can do it.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.414
You can do it.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.291
One more time, go.
Okay.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.393
Yes.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.601
(laughs)

35:38.536 --> 35:39.536
(groaning)

35:39.538 --> 35:41.338
(yelling in russian)

35:41.340 --> 35:42.739
(all gasping)

35:44.242 --> 35:45.509
There's fire everywhere!

35:45.511 --> 35:47.444
Let's get out of here.

35:47.446 --> 35:48.879
(speaking russian)

35:57.188 --> 35:58.822
Toby:
Freeze! Fbi!
Drop those heaters

35:58.824 --> 36:00.423
Before I put more
holes in you

36:00.425 --> 36:01.391
Than a salt shaker!

36:01.393 --> 36:04.427
Yeah, that's right,
turkeys!

36:04.429 --> 36:06.563
Got you lit up
like chinese new year!

36:06.565 --> 36:08.431
(quietly):
Happy...

36:08.433 --> 36:10.433
Stop shaking that dvd laser
so much.

36:10.435 --> 36:12.369
Shut up.
Thug:
If you shoot,

36:12.371 --> 36:14.171
We kill this guy!
Toby:
Oh!

36:14.173 --> 36:15.272
Oh, you want to kill
a convict?

36:15.274 --> 36:16.373
Go ahead!

36:16.375 --> 36:17.307
But you want to dance,
let's dance!

36:17.309 --> 36:18.742
I got nothing to lose, comrade!

36:18.744 --> 36:19.776
What is wrong with you?

36:19.778 --> 36:21.311
Russian men grow up watching

36:21.313 --> 36:23.346
Bootleg american
'80s action films.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.815
I'm the crazy, unpredictable
cop with a suicidal streak.

36:25.817 --> 36:26.783
It's working.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.187
What the hell's this?

36:30.189 --> 36:31.221
Happy:
Oh, man...

36:31.223 --> 36:32.656
Your laptop is dying.

36:32.658 --> 36:35.392
If you're fbi, show yourself.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.693
No.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.695
We're in trouble.

36:44.635 --> 36:47.404
Toby:
Okay! All right! Don't shoot!

36:47.406 --> 36:50.340
Don't shoot!

36:52.476 --> 36:53.476
Who else is with you?

36:53.478 --> 36:54.711
No one.
Just us.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.881
(clattering)

36:57.883 --> 36:59.849
Thug:
Show yourselves
or your friends die!

36:59.851 --> 37:00.951
Walter...

37:00.953 --> 37:02.219
Take paige. Go.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.320
We are not leaving you.

37:03.322 --> 37:03.954
Walter's the boss, okay?

37:03.956 --> 37:05.422
You were right.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.690
Ralph needs you to
look out for him.

37:06.692 --> 37:07.891
Not a bunch
of geniuses.

37:07.893 --> 37:08.725
Now go.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.826
Go.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.430
Coming out!
Unarmed!

37:14.398 --> 37:16.800
Come on, come
on, let's go.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.981
Thug:
Hey, who are you?

37:30.983 --> 37:32.449
Federal agents.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.683
You're surrounded.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.852
We'll shoot
them inside,

37:35.854 --> 37:37.487
Let the fire take
care of the bodies.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.021
Let's go.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.489
Move!

37:48.332 --> 37:50.533
Cabe: Drop your weapons!
(gunfire)

37:53.771 --> 37:55.472
(grunting)

37:57.308 --> 37:58.942
Don't move.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.612
Agent:
Freeze!

38:02.614 --> 38:03.847
Agent 2:
Let me see your hands!

38:06.517 --> 38:08.051
Look at that...

38:08.053 --> 38:11.021
You remembered
to go for the nose.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.926
Come on, in the truck,
all the way in.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.929
Walter:
It's bad enough when people
who aren't enabled exploit us,

38:19.931 --> 38:21.898
But if we can't
trust each other...

38:21.900 --> 38:22.899
(scoffs)

38:22.901 --> 38:24.968
...There's no one left.

38:27.438 --> 38:31.007
I know you're not wrong
often, but you're...

38:31.009 --> 38:33.943
Taking this miscalculation
of percy pretty strong.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.445
I don't care
about percy.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.315
Is this about
you and me?

38:40.418 --> 38:42.652
What happened with baghdad
when you were a kid?

38:42.654 --> 38:45.655
You were the closest thing
I had to a father

38:45.657 --> 38:47.657
And you betrayed me.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.859
I don't think
I've ever really

38:49.861 --> 38:51.928
Forgiven you for that.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.096
And that's why
you've been worried

38:53.098 --> 38:56.533
About ralph's old man
coming around.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.601
You're worried
he might get hurt

38:58.603 --> 39:00.570
Just like I hurt you.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.639
We should get back.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.343
Happy:
Hey.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.977
Hey.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.947
I know we don't know
each other that well,

39:10.949 --> 39:12.849
But I gotta say
something to you.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.050
Please don't talk
to me about drew.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.552
You are the only
one who hasn't

39:15.554 --> 39:16.786
Tried to tell me
how to parent today.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.021
I don't want to talk about drew.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.558
Oh, well, it was nice
while it lasted.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.892
Listen to me.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.394
Walter thinks he knows
what's best for that kid.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.363
You think you know
what's best for that kid.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.430
But the truth is,

39:27.432 --> 39:28.565
I know what's best
for that kid.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.066
Happy...
My dad
disappeared.

39:31.936 --> 39:34.504
Ralph counted all the movies
his father may have seen;

39:34.506 --> 39:37.474
I watched from the windows
of a dozen foster homes

39:37.476 --> 39:39.709
For a red truck
with a dented fender.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.479
We have both spent
our lives waiting

39:42.481 --> 39:43.813
For someone to come home.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.048
Just to know

39:45.050 --> 39:47.684
We still matter.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.386
So if there's even a chance

39:49.388 --> 39:50.887
You can end what
ralph's going through,

39:50.889 --> 39:52.021
Then you do it.

39:52.023 --> 39:55.692
That's it; I'm done.

40:00.698 --> 40:01.765
Hey.
Hey.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.969
You're going to let him
meet ralph.

40:05.971 --> 40:06.970
No.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.772
I'm going to let
ralph meet him.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.106
I'm doing it for my son.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.842
You're going to tell him
ralph's a genius.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.010
That carries risk.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.112
If drew's going to have

40:16.114 --> 40:18.114
A relationship with his son,

40:18.116 --> 40:19.949
He needs to know who he is.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.585
And ralph's mind
is one of the things

40:22.587 --> 40:23.686
That makes him special.

40:23.688 --> 40:26.189
Moving forward,
no more interfering.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.894
But if ralph
does need me...

40:30.896 --> 40:32.162
I will be
close by.

40:44.041 --> 40:45.008
Excuse me.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.543
Yeah?

40:46.545 --> 40:49.012
I, uh, was wondering
if you're hiring.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.881
I'm barely keeping this
place afloat myself.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.050
Okay.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.452
Thanks.

40:55.454 --> 40:58.021
It's tough out there, huh?

40:58.023 --> 40:59.589
Been outta
work long?

40:59.591 --> 41:00.590
No.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.926
I got a job.

41:02.928 --> 41:06.029
It's just intense at times.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.064
Wrenching relaxes me.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.499
Me, too.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.600
Okay...

41:10.602 --> 41:12.001
Take it easy.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.918
Hey...
Yeah?

41:28.920 --> 41:31.221
You know, you can,
uh, save some time

41:31.223 --> 41:33.056
If you come in underneath
the oil gasket.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.558
Is that right?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.026
You mind?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.261
No.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.263
Why don't you go ahead?

41:44.235 --> 41:45.902
Little light?
Yeah.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.173
You're good.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.241
Thanks.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.748
Hey...

42:02.019 --> 42:03.186
Hi, ralph.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.521
Want to sit?

42:11.095 --> 42:12.862
I'm really happy
to see you again.

42:28.946 --> 42:30.980
Walter:
How'd you know
I'd be here?

42:30.982 --> 42:33.249
You look after the kid,

42:33.251 --> 42:34.584
I'll look after you.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.953
Just like I used to.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.589
That's how this is gonna work.

42:39.591 --> 42:40.657
Okay?

42:43.861 --> 42:45.161
Okay.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.330
Peek frean?

42:59.310 --> 43:00.577
