00:00.131 --> 00:03.247
I really do wonder why it is
that you just refuse to grow up.

00:03.509 --> 00:06.250
I can tell you why. Because then
I might end up just like you.

00:06.512 --> 00:08.994
My phone is ringing off the hook
day and night.

00:09.154 --> 00:11.589
My kid is acting
like he needs a Hollywood agent.

00:11.851 --> 00:14.174
These recruiters wanna try
to get you to commit

00:14.436 --> 00:16.175
to any other school any way they can.

00:18.858 --> 00:20.180
The high school in Laribee...

00:20.442 --> 00:23.767
Half of school got completely lifted up
and knocked out by the tornado.

00:24.029 --> 00:26.687
We're gonna be good hosts and guests.
I know coach Dickes

00:26.949 --> 00:30.441
and as long as he don't stir things up,
I think it's gonna be just fine.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.901
- Hey, what are you doing?
- He pissed on my shirt.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.821
Don't you push me!
Don't you ever lay your hands on me!

00:38.413 --> 00:41.243
You ever, I mean,
ever touch one of my players again...

00:41.505 --> 00:42.610
Hey, Jules.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.705
- It's time we go.
- Where's my beer?

00:45.070 --> 00:47.291
Remember what I said about being quiet.

00:48.010 --> 00:49.627
- Okay, you good?
- I'm good.

00:49.889 --> 00:51.754
- Hey, Jule.
- Coach...

00:52.393 --> 00:54.340
It's not even close to what you think.

00:54.602 --> 00:57.500
Go get your stuff
and get out of this house right now.

01:02.434 --> 01:05.099
<i>... used to be
we had to wait till February</i>

01:05.361 --> 01:07.479
<i>in the national letter
of intent signing day,</i>

01:07.983 --> 01:10.235
<i>but folks, the times, they have changed.</i>

01:10.395 --> 01:13.004
<i>It is all about verbal commitment now.</i>

01:13.164 --> 01:15.806
- <i>And the race is on to see which one...</i>
- Hey, Smash.

01:16.081 --> 01:18.822
<i>Where you at? Alabama's
and Oklahoma Tech on their way.</i>

01:19.084 --> 01:21.611
Yeah, I'm just coming up.
Oh my God, Alabama!

01:21.771 --> 01:22.944
- <i>Hurry up.</i>
- Okay.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.282
I'm coming up right now, bye.

01:25.757 --> 01:29.194
I have been to the mountain top
and Tuscaloosa is here.

01:29.354 --> 01:31.044
God bless America

01:31.304 --> 01:33.280
and God bless Alabama football.

01:34.038 --> 01:35.255
Here she is.

01:37.102 --> 01:38.217
I'm sorry, I'm late.

01:38.479 --> 01:39.676
That's all right.

01:40.271 --> 01:42.638
This is my girl. Her brother plays
for the Miami Southern,

01:42.900 --> 01:45.683
- so, she's like my advisor.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:46.212 --> 01:48.843
- Hi, Mrs Williams.
- I was just telling Brian here,

01:49.003 --> 01:51.815
that we got a slot all ready to go
for him there in Tuscaloosa.

01:52.076 --> 01:54.108
National Championships,
it's pretty good resume.

01:54.369 --> 01:55.944
Young lady knows her stuff.

01:56.675 --> 01:58.654
Now, all we need is verbal commitment,

01:58.915 --> 02:00.782
and red carpet'll roll
like the tide itself.

02:01.267 --> 02:04.950
Great. But are you willing to weigh the
physicals and garantee all four years?

02:05.110 --> 02:08.038
That's something we'll definitely
have to consider. She knows her stuff.

02:08.592 --> 02:10.708
Yeah, she knows a thing or two.

02:10.970 --> 02:14.295
Oklahoma Tech, where legends are made.

02:14.556 --> 02:16.798
- All real, all real.
- Yeah?

02:17.059 --> 02:19.938
Alright, now. Do you ever play
football in a snow storm, son?

02:20.173 --> 02:21.177
It's epic.

02:21.437 --> 02:23.579
Michigan is
the harder college football, Brian.

02:23.739 --> 02:25.875
And we'd like
to make you part of our team.

02:26.035 --> 02:28.225
You're gonna be our next big star.

02:29.119 --> 02:31.770
You gotta come play in Georgia, Brian.
They'll love you there.

02:32.031 --> 02:33.356
Y'all are definitely top 5.

02:33.829 --> 02:36.317
Look, all I need is a verbal...

02:36.577 --> 02:39.135
We'll let you know, okay?
But, thanks for the peanuts.

02:39.767 --> 02:40.946
They boil these things.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.575
So good, they'll make you
wanna slap your grandma.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.910
- Thanks for coming out.
- Alright.

02:47.172 --> 02:48.913
- Take care. You'll call?
- Yes, sir.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.903
Good.

03:13.331 --> 03:14.585
About last night,

03:15.314 --> 03:16.775
I put you in that situation.

03:17.205 --> 03:19.287
- No, wait...
- No, just listen to me.

03:19.447 --> 03:22.890
I should not have trusted
Tim Riggins being in this house,

03:23.050 --> 03:24.616
I should have talked to y'all before,

03:24.876 --> 03:27.304
I made any decision on having him here.

03:29.735 --> 03:32.624
He so much even looks at you at school,
I want you to tell me about it,

03:32.884 --> 03:34.283
you understand that?

03:34.443 --> 03:35.494
Please?

03:38.047 --> 03:40.839
You gotta pick it up,
or we're gonna be late, okay?

03:43.567 --> 03:44.568
Yeah.

04:54.609 --> 04:57.082
You cannot be in here after hours.
You understand me?

04:58.019 --> 05:00.517
I want you to clear this stuff up
and clear out.

05:00.677 --> 05:01.681
You got it?

05:09.488 --> 05:12.077
Noannie!
Are you messing with my phone again?!

05:12.237 --> 05:13.056
No.

05:13.317 --> 05:15.010
It was in my room, so somebody took it.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.565
- I didn't. Bug off!
- Don't just up walk on outta here!

05:17.725 --> 05:19.534
Noannie, I'm not playing.
Where's my phone?!

05:19.694 --> 05:21.399
What are you doing to your sister?

05:21.660 --> 05:24.515
Is that what your little girlfriend
tells you college boys do nodays?

05:24.675 --> 05:25.903
Look, don't start, mama.

05:26.165 --> 05:28.489
"Don't start, mama"?
Who you think you talkin'to?!

05:28.749 --> 05:31.658
- Somebody took my phone.
- She didn't take it. I did.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.660
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

05:33.921 --> 05:35.413
You've been on it day and night.

05:35.848 --> 05:39.082
So now get your head back in school
and leave this recruitin' mess alone.

05:39.344 --> 05:41.461
I've to make a verbal commitment.
You understand?

05:41.722 --> 05:43.359
Yeah, I understand that.

05:43.519 --> 05:45.628
I also understand
you need to use your head.

05:46.133 --> 05:47.546
If you commit too soon,

05:47.706 --> 05:50.053
and you don't think
about everything that's involved,

05:50.431 --> 05:52.638
you're gonna be makin' a big mistake.

05:53.056 --> 05:54.650
I'm gonna do this, mama.

05:55.595 --> 05:56.650
With you...

05:57.354 --> 05:58.518
or without you.

05:59.049 --> 06:00.715
Now I gotta get to class.

06:09.749 --> 06:10.823
Hey, Shel.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.868
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

06:13.211 --> 06:14.285
It smells good.

06:16.282 --> 06:18.206
- Is that my shirt?
- No.

06:18.466 --> 06:20.314
- It looks like it.
- OK, it's your shirt.

06:20.474 --> 06:21.918
But you should give it to me.

06:22.178 --> 06:24.170
- It's too sexy for you.
- I beg your pardon?

06:24.430 --> 06:26.447
It's too tight.
You can't wear this to school.

06:26.607 --> 06:29.342
What about the boys' hormones?
They'll think you're hitting on 'em.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.344
Oh, that is ridiculous.

06:31.604 --> 06:33.769
- It's not too tight...
- Here's your bowl.

06:33.929 --> 06:35.974
- or sexy, or anything like that.
- Tami?

06:36.234 --> 06:38.101
- What?
- My results.

06:38.362 --> 06:40.895
- You got it?
- What is it?

06:41.155 --> 06:42.479
Open it. Open it.

06:42.741 --> 06:45.357
- What is it?
- It's the results from her exam.

06:46.619 --> 06:47.818
Oh, my God, I passed!

06:48.080 --> 06:49.406
You did!

06:51.964 --> 06:53.962
- That's great, sweetie.
- I know.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.410
I'm so proud of you!

06:57.166 --> 06:58.204
She passed!

06:58.464 --> 07:00.905
Shelly Hayes passed the test.

07:01.175 --> 07:03.437
That's excellent.
What are you gonna do now?

07:03.766 --> 07:06.296
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know, I mean...

07:06.556 --> 07:07.922
I take y'all to dinner.

07:08.182 --> 07:09.506
Oh, that's so sweet.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.573
- Let's have some dinner at Applebees.
- Wait, now.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.388
You just passed the test,
you gotta figure out a few things:

07:15.648 --> 07:18.933
how you'll jump start the business,
where you'll go, how you'll set it up.

07:19.193 --> 07:21.643
And I can talk to a bunch of people,
get you involved

07:21.905 --> 07:24.559
with a lot of folks that can give you
answers to your questions.

07:24.719 --> 07:26.607
Oh, my God, Eric.
That would be so amazing.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.265
No, anything I can do
to help you with that.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.654
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

07:31.914 --> 07:33.216
It's my pleasure.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.616
I was gonna talk to you about this,

07:36.076 --> 07:38.247
but when you're starting out
as a real estate agent,

07:38.407 --> 07:41.176
you have to do these cold calls
as the fondation of your business.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.818
I don't want to make all those calls
and tie up your phones,

07:43.978 --> 07:47.272
so I did a little bit research.
And it would only cost $9 a month

07:47.432 --> 07:49.775
to put a new phone line in here.
And I was thinking

07:49.935 --> 07:52.832
since you have a teenager
we could share a phone line.

07:52.992 --> 07:55.281
- That sounds good to me.
- That sounds like something

07:55.441 --> 07:57.722
we should definitely talk about.
Absolutely.

07:57.982 --> 08:01.920
For sure, but let's go to Applebees.
That sounds like a great idea.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.829
This stuff'll keep till tomorrow.
All right?

08:04.989 --> 08:06.814
Let me get my stuff. Hold on.

08:30.514 --> 08:31.524
You here?

08:44.153 --> 08:46.437
Look, it was just
a friendly gesture, that's all.

08:46.597 --> 08:49.166
I understand,
but I can buy my own groceries.

08:49.326 --> 08:52.216
Miss Williams,
I know being a single parent's hard.

08:52.376 --> 08:55.123
You've done a great job with your kids,
supporting them as a nurse.

08:55.283 --> 08:57.718
I just want you to know
Oklahoma Tech is here for you.

08:57.878 --> 09:00.660
In many cases, we can provide
a first-class relocation.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.830
Mister, you need to think about
relocatin' your butt up out of my way.

09:04.090 --> 09:06.052
Housing near the campus
for the athletes' parents

09:06.212 --> 09:08.709
- so the families can stay together.
- Stay together?

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
Yes, ma'am.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.197
And we'll arrange for job for you too,

09:12.357 --> 09:14.632
with good pay at the local hospital.
And you get

09:14.892 --> 09:17.314
all your weekends off,
so you can catch all Brian's games.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.637
You might be
the nicest person I ever met,

09:19.897 --> 09:21.764
or you might be Satan himself.

09:22.025 --> 09:24.377
But either way,
this conversation is over.

09:24.537 --> 09:26.174
Miss Williams, just hear me out.

09:26.334 --> 09:28.227
No, what happens if he gets hurt, huh?

09:28.387 --> 09:30.148
What happens to my house and my job,

09:30.408 --> 09:31.613
my son's education?

09:31.773 --> 09:34.277
- He's not gonna get hurt.
- You tell me that.

09:36.299 --> 09:37.697
- Hey.
- Everything all right?

09:37.957 --> 09:39.643
Everything's just fine.

09:40.751 --> 09:42.326
Seems like you need to step away.

09:42.586 --> 09:44.717
- Ladies, please.
- That's the right thing to do.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.290
- You need to step away.
- You heard what she said.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.501
Have yourself a good day, okay?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.420
How was your day?

09:57.580 --> 09:58.925
It was good. How was yours?

10:00.688 --> 10:01.721
Let's go.

10:06.778 --> 10:08.310
Learned anything interesting?

10:12.633 --> 10:13.742
Not really.

10:19.331 --> 10:20.503
It's that girl.

10:21.729 --> 10:25.286
She got my son's head spinnin'
every which way direction.

10:25.547 --> 10:27.987
- I don't like it.
- That girl Noelle?

10:28.871 --> 10:31.080
- I raised these kids by myself.
- I know.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.003
My whole life has been about
taking care of them.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.757
And she waltzes in
and is trying to turn him

10:38.017 --> 10:41.511
into some rich fast-talking
blinged-out football star,

10:41.771 --> 10:43.429
or some kind of hot prospect.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.932
He ain't gonna do nothin'
but get chewed up and spit out.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.475
I just want him to be a good man,
you know?

10:48.635 --> 10:50.561
I know.
But what he's trying to do is

10:50.721 --> 10:53.135
he's trying to take responsibility
for his future,

10:53.295 --> 10:55.333
in whatever way he knows how.

10:59.553 --> 11:02.841
I just didn't think
it would be this hard letting him go.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.494
I know, that's for sure.

11:07.587 --> 11:08.686
I know that.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.610
I... I just...

11:20.770 --> 11:23.593
I came over to apologize
about the other night. My dad just...

11:24.184 --> 11:25.804
He jumped to conclusions,

11:26.099 --> 11:28.224
and... and I just...
I couldn't tell him.

11:29.572 --> 11:30.572
That's fine.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.520
I'm really sorry, though.

11:32.780 --> 11:33.984
Don't worry about it.

11:34.144 --> 11:37.194
And I wanted to say thanks
for saving me from that whole...

11:37.684 --> 11:39.019
Riley thing.

11:39.179 --> 11:41.324
It wouldn't have ended good.

11:41.705 --> 11:42.878
I agree.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.761
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think so.

11:46.710 --> 11:48.268
But really, it's...
It's fine.

11:48.428 --> 11:50.037
It'll blow over, I'm sure.

11:51.573 --> 11:52.415
Thanks.

11:52.954 --> 11:54.124
You're welcome.

11:54.954 --> 11:57.877
Okay, well, I will see you later then.

11:58.286 --> 11:59.385
Good night.

12:08.975 --> 12:10.474
<i>Coach Taylor and the Panthers</i>

12:10.818 --> 12:13.059

have set up camp here in Dillon.</i>

12:20.393 --> 12:22.970
<i>Close quarter have led to
more than a few altercations,</i>

12:23.130 --> 12:25.448
<i>including a reported dust-up</i>

12:25.708 --> 12:29.075
<i>between Coach Taylor
and Laribee's Coach Dickes.</i>

12:41.621 --> 12:42.523
Coach.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.509
- You want to get a beer with me?
- I don't drink, Coach Taylor.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.970
You don't drink,
or you don't drink with me?

12:50.683 --> 12:52.293
Look, I know y'all been uprooted.

12:52.453 --> 12:54.485
I know it's not easy,
space beg around here...

12:54.645 --> 12:56.728
it's very small.
I know times are tough.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.849
Thanks for acknowledging
that times are tough.

12:59.009 --> 13:01.131
Thanks for helping me out with that.
By the way,

13:01.440 --> 13:03.443
I went ahead and spoke
with Coach Roberts.

13:03.704 --> 13:06.052
And it seems tomorrow
we'll be moving my team

13:06.212 --> 13:08.157
into the girls soccer team locker room.

13:09.194 --> 13:10.451
I'm really busy, Coach.

13:10.711 --> 13:12.903
Just go ahead
and take that country charm of yours

13:13.063 --> 13:14.622
and go buy somebody else a beer.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.424
He have you talked to TMU yet?

13:27.686 --> 13:30.681
They playin' hard to get,
but you know, so am I.

13:30.841 --> 13:32.640
So we'll see how it works out.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.298
Yo, what's up, Swash?

13:35.527 --> 13:36.960
Hey, what's up, chippendale?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.893
Yo, man, TMU came a callin'.

13:39.053 --> 13:40.898
I'm playing football
in Austin this fall.

13:42.547 --> 13:45.276
Hey, man, listen,
we gonna be teammates or what?

13:45.989 --> 13:49.599
Hey, look, listen up.
I got better thing to do than TMU.

13:49.759 --> 13:52.117
Like what, you get the manager job
at the Alamo Freeze?

13:57.831 --> 13:59.207
Alabama, baby!

13:59.888 --> 14:00.888
Alabama!
What?!

14:01.048 --> 14:02.062
S-E-C.

14:02.822 --> 14:04.255
You gave Alabama the verbal?

14:04.515 --> 14:05.526
You know what?

14:05.686 --> 14:07.918
It's gonna be the shot
heard around the world.

14:08.078 --> 14:10.207
- You just gonna have to wait and see.
- Oh, I will.

14:10.479 --> 14:11.479
Good luck.

14:16.626 --> 14:19.251
I thought, like, 'bama's sweet,
but I thought...

14:19.411 --> 14:21.195
You sure you don't want to go to TMU?

14:21.355 --> 14:23.649
You don't wanna hold out
and see what they got to offer?

14:27.293 --> 14:29.225
- Ask me what I'm doing.
- What are you doing?

14:29.385 --> 14:31.347
Getting some paper towels
to clean up a dozen eggs

14:31.507 --> 14:33.742
that are on our kitchen floor.
Shelly went to the store

14:34.002 --> 14:36.370
which I asked her to do:
to go get eggs, because we needed eggs.

14:36.530 --> 14:39.205
And then she comes in and dropped 'em
all on the floor, like a dingbat.

14:39.365 --> 14:40.787
And then she just looks at 'em,

14:40.947 --> 14:42.709
she just stares at 'em
and says, "oh, no,"

14:42.970 --> 14:44.656
and then walks back to the back bedroom.

14:44.816 --> 14:47.547
Maybe it's time for her to fly the coop.
You ever think about that?

14:47.707 --> 14:51.135
She keeps telling me that
I need to cut my hair all off.

14:51.395 --> 14:53.715
Because of the baby and everything.
That it's too long.

14:53.981 --> 14:56.398
It's starting to get me insecure.
Do I need to get my hair cut?

14:56.558 --> 14:59.560
No, you don't need to. Your hair
is perfect, stop listening to her.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.581
- She's driving me crazy.
- She should cause she's crazy.

15:03.127 --> 15:05.559
Hey, hon, you know what
I've been meaning to tell you?

15:05.719 --> 15:07.517
- What?
- I ran into Corrina Williams,

15:07.677 --> 15:08.732
at the market.

15:08.892 --> 15:11.739
And she was being accosted
by a recruiter.

15:11.999 --> 15:14.058
And she just seemed at her wit's end.

15:14.385 --> 15:16.392
It seems like she's real worried
about Smash,

15:16.552 --> 15:19.694
about this girlfriend of his,
she thinks is a bad influence.

15:19.965 --> 15:22.686
There's nothing I can do
about all his girlfriends, so...

15:22.846 --> 15:23.875
I'm just saying,

15:24.137 --> 15:26.586
you know, it might be good
if you had a talk with him,

15:26.847 --> 15:29.253
because he does not have
a male role model in his world.

15:29.413 --> 15:30.802
I'm gonna do that too,

15:30.962 --> 15:34.046
as soon as I figure out how not to get
my ass handed to me on Friday night.

15:34.389 --> 15:35.713
Okay? Thank you.

15:36.948 --> 15:37.948
Oh, God.

15:38.159 --> 15:39.054
Tami...

15:40.492 --> 15:42.268
I was just blow drying my hair,

15:42.529 --> 15:44.443
and all this black smoke
start to coming out.

15:44.603 --> 15:47.651
I think it's probably broken.
Do you have another hair dryer?

15:47.811 --> 15:50.546
No. Actually, Shelly,
that's the only hair dryer we have.

15:50.706 --> 15:52.353
I think you better go get another one.

15:52.513 --> 15:55.015
While you're at it, maybe pick up
some eggs. That'll be great.

15:57.461 --> 15:59.657
No, I never said I sent the payment.

16:02.038 --> 16:04.958
But I'm gonna send that money
right now, actually. Okay.

16:11.938 --> 16:12.967
How you doing?

16:14.263 --> 16:15.925
- All right.
- What's up?

16:16.310 --> 16:17.954
Just moving our stuff out.

16:18.433 --> 16:19.639
How you and Billy doing?

16:20.014 --> 16:21.180
We broke up.

16:23.936 --> 16:25.229
Sorry to hear that.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.622
You know, uh, if you want
to finish that Riggins trifecta,

16:30.782 --> 16:34.331
I think my dad lives in corpus still.
I could probably give you his address.

16:34.772 --> 16:36.537
That's just mean.
You're awful.

16:36.777 --> 16:39.134
I think you kind of deserve it,
don't you think?

16:39.847 --> 16:40.849
Yeah...

16:41.258 --> 16:42.287
I do.

16:43.351 --> 16:46.027
You want to tell me what happened
between you and Billy or what?

16:46.281 --> 16:48.173
Look,
I know you're gonna hate me forever,

16:48.333 --> 16:50.716
and I don't blame you
but I want you to know...

16:51.491 --> 16:53.799
that I was alone and I was scared,

16:54.189 --> 16:56.594
and I was just trying
to build a life for my son.

16:56.854 --> 16:58.929
- So what happened?
- It didn't work out.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.215
He lost his job.

17:01.817 --> 17:03.495
And I can't handle two mortgages.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.453
I mean, I could been
the first to tell you

17:05.613 --> 17:08.112
that guy can't hold a job
for more than six months.

17:08.382 --> 17:09.382
You know...

17:12.185 --> 17:14.506
I hope you can patch things up with him,

17:14.665 --> 17:16.478
'cause he loves you so much.

17:17.781 --> 17:18.781
Maybe...

17:19.255 --> 17:21.336
Maybe you need him too, you know.

17:23.473 --> 17:26.063
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get in the way.

17:31.568 --> 17:34.263
Have a safe trip, wherever you're going.

17:37.159 --> 17:37.960
Bye.

17:54.330 --> 17:57.476
Is that The Office? Oh, my God,
I love this show. I'm so addicted to it.

17:57.636 --> 18:00.198
I was so scared that it didn't tape.
Have you ever seen it?

18:00.639 --> 18:01.740
It's so good.

18:02.023 --> 18:05.370
Actually, I don't know if you would
really like it. It's very talky.

18:05.948 --> 18:07.395
You taped over my game.

18:08.051 --> 18:10.876
I'm sorry.
It was an important game?

18:11.260 --> 18:14.152
Yes, it was a very important game!
You taped over my game.

18:14.312 --> 18:15.343
I'm sorry.

18:15.644 --> 18:17.255
I mean, I didn't know.
I just...

18:17.670 --> 18:19.677
I just used the tape that was in there.

18:20.462 --> 18:22.720
You know, you guys...
You should get a TiVo.

18:22.981 --> 18:24.390
Can I ask you something?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.475
You got any concept
about personal property?

18:27.928 --> 18:31.223
You know, like how about
personal private moments

18:31.383 --> 18:34.400
in the privacy of one's
personal, private space?

18:34.856 --> 18:36.528
Do you understand what I'm saying?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.742
- I know what privacy means.
- I understand

18:38.902 --> 18:40.976
that you're my wife's sister
but we've been wondering

18:41.136 --> 18:43.658
when is it, exactly, that you're
gonna get a place of your own?

18:47.923 --> 18:49.653
I didn't mean it to come out like that.

18:49.813 --> 18:51.521
- Oh, my God.
- That came out wrong.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.836
That came out wrong.
I'm sorry.

18:54.096 --> 18:55.129
Just stop talking.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.885
- I didn't mean to say it like that.
- No, I heard you,

18:58.045 --> 18:59.886
it's fine. I'll take the laundry.

19:00.046 --> 19:01.885
I just feel kind of stupid right now.

19:02.845 --> 19:03.845
It's fine.

19:14.251 --> 19:15.482
Come on in.

19:16.595 --> 19:18.039
Oh, she's with me, Coach.

19:18.766 --> 19:19.903
Noelle.

19:20.163 --> 19:22.197
Yes, hi.
It's so nice to meet you.

19:22.457 --> 19:24.950
I'm a very big fan.
The way you took down West Cambria

19:25.210 --> 19:28.245
at the state championships last year
was the best coached game

19:28.505 --> 19:31.582
- I think I've ever seen.
- I'm glad you noticed. Thank you.

19:31.842 --> 19:33.292
You're welcome.

19:33.552 --> 19:35.547
So imagine your phone is
ringing off the hook.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.871
You're getting text messages
till 4:00 a.m.

19:38.031 --> 19:39.186
What's it all mean?

19:39.346 --> 19:42.010
Well, playing at Alabama
is at the top of the list.

19:43.436 --> 19:44.436
Alabama?

19:44.935 --> 19:46.129
Anything else?

19:46.289 --> 19:48.298
Lots of places, Coach.
We're thinking

19:48.458 --> 19:50.559
a national championship run
would be beneficial.

19:50.819 --> 19:52.834
It's lots of coverage, good exposure.

19:52.994 --> 19:54.622
So I roll on over to Alabama.

19:54.782 --> 19:58.025
Coach has got good ties to the pros,
and I'm living the NFL dream.

19:59.471 --> 20:00.277
TMU?

20:00.986 --> 20:02.571
I still haven't heard from 'em.

20:02.831 --> 20:04.843
They're getting back
at you for walkin' on 'em.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.413
Any history between me and TMU
has nothing to do with you.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.477
They want you,
they're gonna come after you.

20:09.637 --> 20:12.247
Look, the point is
I gotta make a verbal, Coach.

20:12.762 --> 20:15.125
Before you hear from TMU,
you gotta make your verbal?

20:15.502 --> 20:16.502
I mean...

20:17.301 --> 20:18.962
What am I supposed to do?

20:19.535 --> 20:22.049
All right, let me tell you what I know
about Alabama, then.

20:22.602 --> 20:25.839
They got the best running back
in the conference: Demetrius Walsh.

20:25.999 --> 20:28.132
And another thing:
he is not going pro either...

20:28.292 --> 20:30.807
- He's staying his senior year, we know.
- That's one year.

20:32.001 --> 20:34.144
I can handle it if it means Alabama.

20:34.404 --> 20:38.065
What about Waters? 500 yards this year.
He's a freshman backup.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.069
He's already mastered their offense,
which is extremely complicated.

20:42.329 --> 20:45.056
Now, that's your sophomore, junior year
on the scout team.

20:45.216 --> 20:47.081
That's three years on the bench

20:47.241 --> 20:49.868
before you even touch your foot
on that turf on a Saturday.

20:50.741 --> 20:54.665
Or there are other situations out there:
schools that need you to play now.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.617
It's gonna be a fight.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.836
You gotta give yourself
the opportunity to play,

20:59.096 --> 21:00.504
the opportunity to be seen.

21:00.764 --> 21:03.105
You might want to
settle down, take a breath.

21:03.265 --> 21:06.385
And you definitely want
to look at the fine print, son.

21:07.028 --> 21:09.778
I'm saying: be patient.
Don't let 'em pressure you.

21:11.341 --> 21:13.934
And don't end up making any
emotional decisions.

21:15.036 --> 21:16.520
That makes a lot of sense.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.127
What does your mother say?

21:20.395 --> 21:21.441
My mom?

21:21.701 --> 21:24.298
The woman who gave you birth,
what did she say?

21:24.745 --> 21:25.772
Honestly,

21:26.500 --> 21:29.248
I don't think my mom knows
the difference between Alabama

21:29.408 --> 21:30.951
and Dillon Junior College.

21:31.211 --> 21:33.799
Let me tell you something.
My last piece of advice for you.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.664
Listen to your mother.

21:36.113 --> 21:39.613
You listen to her, and you respect her.
You understand what I'm saying?

21:41.158 --> 21:42.546
Now get the hell out of here.

21:42.806 --> 21:45.340
- Let me finish my lunch.
- Appreciate it.

21:45.854 --> 21:48.663
- Let me know you need anything else.
- All right.

22:01.491 --> 22:04.336
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking into a motel.

22:04.496 --> 22:06.778
- Why? What happened?
- Eric asked me to leave.

22:08.484 --> 22:11.116
Well, hon, he's in a terrible...
He's such a grump this week.

22:11.767 --> 22:14.620
No, he didn't mean it.
Come on, let's go back in the house...

22:14.880 --> 22:17.456
- Sweetie, come on now.
- Honey, it's for the best, OK?

22:17.716 --> 22:21.084
I don't want to be an imposition.
I just wanted to help with Gracie...

22:21.344 --> 22:24.929
Well, hon, listen.
Now come on, we need to talk about this.

22:25.089 --> 22:26.757
Come on, Tami, you want this.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.717
Yes, you do, honey.

22:28.977 --> 22:32.179
OK, I mean, you didn't want to tell me,
that's fine. You got Eric to do it.

22:32.339 --> 22:34.522
But you know...
It's fine.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.392
I'll call you when I check in.

22:43.115 --> 22:44.242
I understand.

22:50.739 --> 22:51.740
Coach.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.119
You left your playbook on the field.

23:01.927 --> 23:04.415
You're just
a regular boy scout, aren't ya?

23:08.610 --> 23:10.008
You're welcome.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.574
What are you doing?

23:35.711 --> 23:37.119
I lost my keys.

23:38.003 --> 23:39.454
You look like crap.

23:58.196 --> 23:59.364
How you doin'?

24:00.622 --> 24:02.896
I left Julie down at the sandwich shop.

24:03.056 --> 24:05.147
Did you kick my sister
out of the house today?

24:05.407 --> 24:06.523
No, I didn't.

24:06.783 --> 24:07.908
What happened?

24:08.068 --> 24:10.151
I asked your sister
when she was gonna leave.

24:10.698 --> 24:14.388
And your sister got very upset
and she pretty much inferred the rest.

24:14.548 --> 24:16.533
And that's pretty much what happened.

24:17.064 --> 24:20.417
I wish maybe you'd talked to me
before you'd had that conversation.

24:21.078 --> 24:22.078
OK.

24:23.935 --> 24:26.107
And in the future, if there's
a family member of mine

24:26.267 --> 24:27.986
that's gonna be kicked out
of this house,

24:28.146 --> 24:30.087
I would prefer that I do
the kicking out.

24:31.753 --> 24:32.756
OK.

24:34.892 --> 24:35.892
OK.

24:40.818 --> 24:44.424
It's like everything happened at once.
I got laid off. I got no severance.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.590
They didn't give me any kind of notice
that this was gonna happen.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.180
So now I'm broke,

24:50.185 --> 24:53.480
And Jackie's going crazy
'cause she's got a kid,

24:53.640 --> 24:56.095
and I got no money to pay for the house.

24:56.711 --> 24:59.756
And, you know, that's when
she bailed on me.

25:03.298 --> 25:05.763
I don't know what else
there is to say about that.

25:12.277 --> 25:13.332
Look...

25:15.333 --> 25:16.333
Tim?

25:17.588 --> 25:18.588
I'm sorry.

25:19.786 --> 25:22.516
I know I screwed up.
All right?

25:23.497 --> 25:25.760
I never should have gotten
with that girl.

25:26.911 --> 25:28.395
And I'm sorry if I hurt you.

25:28.936 --> 25:31.064
It was selfish and...

25:33.107 --> 25:34.160
I'm sorry.

25:41.444 --> 25:43.286
Looks like it's just us two, hu?

25:48.949 --> 25:50.794
What are we gonna do
about the house, Billy?

25:51.258 --> 25:54.381
We gotta come up
with $2,000 in two weeks.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.313
I don't know, unless you got
some great idea,

25:57.473 --> 26:00.584
I think we're gonna have
to start packing our bags, man.

26:08.902 --> 26:09.902
Ready?

26:10.499 --> 26:12.229
Before I go, I want you to know

26:12.389 --> 26:14.956
that I'm sorry
I went off the handle with your sister.

26:15.245 --> 26:16.653
And I apologize.

26:18.751 --> 26:22.725
It's just, you know, there is nothing
in the world I hate

26:23.269 --> 26:26.538
worse than hurting her.
No matter how much she's irritating...

26:26.798 --> 26:31.231
I know that, and I'm gonna call her
and I'm going to apologize to her.

26:31.597 --> 26:33.528
And we will work it all out.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.924
- She was here for a long time.
- You damn right she was.

26:39.648 --> 26:41.427
It'll be nice to have our house back.

26:41.689 --> 26:42.887
Damn right it will be.

26:45.025 --> 26:48.738
What I dread now is what in the world
we're gonna do with Gracie Belle

26:49.267 --> 26:50.520
while we're at work.

26:50.781 --> 26:51.982
I just... I hate it.

26:52.142 --> 26:53.744
Can I tell you something?

26:55.037 --> 26:56.649
That's not our burden.

26:56.809 --> 26:58.252
And it's our gift.

26:59.933 --> 27:01.740
Go win a football game, please.

27:02.889 --> 27:03.909
All right.

27:04.169 --> 27:05.178
OK.

27:07.132 --> 27:09.162
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- I gotta go.

27:09.322 --> 27:11.357
I really need to talk to you right now.

27:11.517 --> 27:14.387
It's about the other night,
and the whole Tim thing.

27:15.357 --> 27:16.845
It wasn't his fault.

27:17.814 --> 27:19.092
What do you mean?

27:19.563 --> 27:20.800
It was my fault.

27:22.337 --> 27:25.639
We were at this party,
and I was drinking,

27:25.899 --> 27:28.615
and there was this other guy
named Riley.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.556
And I was about to get in trouble,

27:31.716 --> 27:35.005
and Tim stopped it, and he took me home.

27:35.165 --> 27:37.651
And he was trying to sneak me in, and...

27:38.293 --> 27:39.882
Then you came in and...

27:41.474 --> 27:44.080
And I'm just trying to say
it was my fault.

27:49.807 --> 27:50.956
Damn, Julie.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.542
I'm sorry.

27:54.638 --> 27:55.654
Damn.

28:07.774 --> 28:10.100
- Attaboy!
- You gotta pick that up!

28:14.852 --> 28:18.815
<i>This contest has turned out
to be a good old-fashioned shoot-out,</i>

28:19.163 --> 28:22.153
<i>a day gun duel in D-Ville:</i>

28:22.413 --> 28:24.614
<i>Taylor vs Dickes.</i>

28:56.239 --> 28:58.677
We got a corner
that's missing every time!

28:58.837 --> 29:00.775
The corners gotta step up!

29:04.474 --> 29:05.688
<i>It's late in the fourth.</i>

29:06.000 --> 29:09.784
<i>Panthers are down by five
with 1:34 left in the game.</i>

29:10.209 --> 29:13.287
<i>It's third down, Panthers need a first.</i>

29:13.670 --> 29:15.540
Take 70. He's been there all night!

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
Time!

29:35.997 --> 29:38.477
What's that, eight?
Fourth and eight?

29:39.686 --> 29:41.691
The safeties
should watch for play-action,

29:41.951 --> 29:43.443
he's gonna try to bust the seam.

29:43.732 --> 29:46.571
- You wanna go cover-three?
- No! Have bandit come up and cover.

29:46.831 --> 29:49.866
I've been baiting this hook
all night long. He's gonna take it.

29:50.126 --> 29:53.739
If we go x-seam on the safeties,
we get Matt to hit it quick. It'll work.

29:54.297 --> 29:56.443
Unless he wants us to go to the seam.

29:56.877 --> 29:58.541
You guys are stinkin' up the field!

29:58.801 --> 30:01.961
- One play, girls. You got in in ya?
- Yes, sir!

30:02.686 --> 30:04.005
Listen up, listen up!

30:04.839 --> 30:07.258
Let's go 26 fake keeper.

30:07.518 --> 30:09.177
Matt, you take it on the boot.

30:09.437 --> 30:12.179
This is what they're gonna do.
They're gonna fake on tackle 26.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.701
Let's make sure
you get to the outside, son.

30:14.861 --> 30:16.379
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

30:16.539 --> 30:18.616
They're gonna bring Saracen
around the edge.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.438
He'll go wide. Nail him there!

30:20.698 --> 30:23.191
- Let's show 'em what we got.
- You gotta be aggressive.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.819
Let's get this done!
Let's get this done.

30:26.079 --> 30:29.321
- Let's take this home right now!
- Get out there!

30:29.582 --> 30:32.242
- One, two, three... Panthers!
- Let's go, baby. Let's go!

30:35.213 --> 30:38.206
<i>Here we go, the game comes down
to this play.</i>

30:38.467 --> 30:42.627
<i>The Lions will win
if they can stop the Panthers here.</i>

30:42.887 --> 30:45.797
Been reading your mail, Coach Taylor.
It's time to take you to school.

30:47.350 --> 30:48.523
Let's go!

30:48.683 --> 30:51.327
<i>Hang on to your hats, folks.
This is it.</i>

30:51.604 --> 30:53.840
<i>Fourth down.
Saracen is over the ball.</i>

30:54.000 --> 30:55.932
<i>It's a handoff to Smash.</i>

30:56.192 --> 30:59.131
<i>No, Saracen keeps the ball on bootleg.</i>

30:59.291 --> 31:00.734
<i>He's got nowhere to go.</i>

31:00.894 --> 31:03.773
<i>He's looking to pass.
He dishes it to the flat. Tim Riggins!</i>

31:04.057 --> 31:05.024
Gotcha!

31:05.284 --> 31:07.360
<i>And he's got some blood, baby!</i>

31:07.620 --> 31:09.810
- Get him! Pick him up!
- There you go!

31:09.970 --> 31:11.531
<i>To the 40, the 45!</i>

31:11.791 --> 31:13.074
Take it in, baby!

31:13.334 --> 31:15.012
<i>He's in Lions' territory</i>

31:15.172 --> 31:16.184
Go and get him!

31:16.344 --> 31:20.331
<i>Tim Riggins could go all the way.
Holly cow!</i>

31:22.442 --> 31:23.877
What the hell was that?

31:24.137 --> 31:25.713
You see that?

31:26.045 --> 31:28.548
All you gotta do is take him down!
Get off of me!

31:29.000 --> 31:32.385
Get off of me!
That's all it takes to take somedy down!

31:32.890 --> 31:33.970
You stick 'em!

31:35.003 --> 31:36.723
You say good-bye to playoff!

31:40.877 --> 31:43.313
Coach interferce.
The game's over.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.061
- All right, that's it. Take it in.
- Let's go!

31:46.221 --> 31:48.280
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.

31:55.402 --> 31:57.202
Can I have a word in here alone, please?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.002
Thank you much.

32:04.945 --> 32:06.491
What the hell was that?

32:06.651 --> 32:08.425
Don, what the hell was that?

32:08.585 --> 32:11.799
You know what I think?
I think you owe this school an apology

32:12.059 --> 32:14.010
is what I think.
And not only that,

32:14.271 --> 32:17.888
but you owe the players over there
an apology. That's what I think.

32:18.272 --> 32:21.809
- I got it.
- You got what? What's it you got, Don?

32:22.128 --> 32:23.590
I've done everything I can.

32:23.750 --> 32:26.731
This school has reached out,
it has opened its arms to you.

32:27.218 --> 32:30.776
- You don't know what I'm going through.
- No, I don't know. But you know what?

32:31.038 --> 32:32.292
For two weeks now,

32:32.452 --> 32:35.198
we've done everything that we can
to help you out over here.

32:35.458 --> 32:36.994
I've been putting up with two weeks.

32:37.154 --> 32:40.077
- Why don't you share with me?
- My wife's got three months to live.

32:43.259 --> 32:45.457
And I don't have a game plan for that.

32:51.522 --> 32:52.981
I'm not using that...

32:53.345 --> 32:55.331
as an excuse, please know that.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.522
I do owe you an apology.

33:01.788 --> 33:04.430
You tell Riggins he's a fine player.

33:05.243 --> 33:06.962
And I'm deeply sorry...

33:07.753 --> 33:09.503
for what I've done to him.

33:11.321 --> 33:13.271
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

33:14.861 --> 33:17.311
I'm not gonna be coaching anytime soon.

33:26.531 --> 33:27.757
I'm very sorry.

33:28.736 --> 33:29.736
Thanks.

33:46.460 --> 33:47.460
Guy.

33:48.666 --> 33:49.964
Guy, it's Riggs.

33:51.298 --> 33:52.366
Buckle up.

33:57.457 --> 33:59.949
Just get your crap
and let's get out of here.

34:04.445 --> 34:06.761
I'll just be down here
becoming a meth addict.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.471
All right, we're good.

34:10.761 --> 34:11.866
Let's go.
Come on.

34:12.138 --> 34:13.670
I gotta put that back, Billy.

34:13.931 --> 34:16.351
I'm not just gonna leave his gun
down there, he'll know.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.427
Hurry up, put it back,
and let's get the hell out of here.

34:21.942 --> 34:23.501
What are you doing?
Come on!

34:25.725 --> 34:26.726
Really?

34:27.110 --> 34:28.810
- Cash.
- Put it back.

34:29.072 --> 34:30.980
Come on, just put it back
and let's get out...

34:31.241 --> 34:32.964
It's a lot of money.

34:33.387 --> 34:34.567
It's our mortgage.

34:42.918 --> 34:44.083
Hurry up.
Come on.

34:44.243 --> 34:46.244
Put the gun back
and let's get out of here.

34:46.505 --> 34:47.996
Let's go.
Come on.

34:48.257 --> 34:50.938
Billy, this is like,
a good chunk of change...

34:55.063 --> 34:56.630
Look, she just woke up.

34:58.769 --> 34:59.769
Hey.

35:03.679 --> 35:05.056
Could I get a decaf, please?

35:05.554 --> 35:06.555
Thanks.

35:07.092 --> 35:08.642
- How are ya?
- I'm good.

35:08.904 --> 35:10.729
So I brought the real estate section.

35:10.889 --> 35:12.405
And actually, there are a couple

35:12.565 --> 35:15.273
of really cute-looking places,
like, right in the neighborhood.

35:15.535 --> 35:19.111
Okay, Tami, I've been doin'
my own homework,

35:19.372 --> 35:21.361
and I have found some really good leads.

35:21.521 --> 35:22.651
Oh, really?

35:23.115 --> 35:24.117
In Dallas.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.599
You're going to Dallas?

35:29.992 --> 35:30.992
How come?

35:33.395 --> 35:35.471
Because I'm driving you crazy,
that's how come.

35:35.631 --> 35:36.921
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.464
Come on, Tami.

35:39.463 --> 35:41.839
You know, Hon, it's just
the house is a little bit small.

35:41.999 --> 35:42.801
Thank you.

35:43.981 --> 35:45.831
And I do think that it's probably good

35:46.107 --> 35:49.141
for Eric and me
to have some privacy again, and...

35:49.403 --> 35:50.403
Yeah.

35:51.536 --> 35:54.178
But that doesn't mean
I want you to go to Dallas.

35:54.614 --> 35:56.453
I have got to get my life together,

35:56.613 --> 35:59.110
and I don't think
that's going to happen here in Dillon.

36:04.069 --> 36:06.534
I kinda like the idea
of having you around.

36:10.198 --> 36:12.615
- We're gonna miss you.
- Thank you.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.667
And I can't thank you enough.

36:15.125 --> 36:16.775
Thank you for asking me.

36:25.224 --> 36:27.414
Hey, what are we gonna do
with the extra grand?

36:27.574 --> 36:28.847
What are you talking about?

36:29.007 --> 36:30.890
We got the mortgage covered,
plus a grand.

36:31.050 --> 36:34.478
That's the last thing I'm worried about.
We just stole $3,000 from a drug dealer.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.685
You don't think there's gonna be...

36:37.071 --> 36:38.702
No, you gotta relax, you know why?

36:38.862 --> 36:41.319
He's probably so high
he doesn't even know what hit him.

36:42.391 --> 36:44.781
- Who the hell is that?
- That can't be him.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.200
- Don't answer it...
- I'm not gonna, relax!

36:49.401 --> 36:51.161
Oh, it's coach.
It's coach.

36:51.422 --> 36:52.422
We're fine.

36:54.007 --> 36:55.707
- Hey, Tim...
- Hey, coach.

36:55.969 --> 36:57.876
- Coach, how you doin'?
- Hey, how you doin'?

36:58.138 --> 37:00.004
I'm good, I'm good.
Things are good.

37:00.450 --> 37:01.450
All right.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.882
I'll let you guys...
do your thing.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.636
Come here.
Let me talk to you a second.

37:10.887 --> 37:12.433
I jumped to conclusions.

37:12.786 --> 37:15.520
I'm well aware of
what happened the other night.

37:16.284 --> 37:18.271
I apogize.
I was wrong.

37:18.712 --> 37:20.988
- It's fine, coach.
- No, it's not fine.

37:21.438 --> 37:23.361
I couldn't have mishandled it any worse,

37:23.911 --> 37:25.664
and I apologize.

37:26.621 --> 37:28.763
The last couple weeks
have been giving you hell.

37:28.923 --> 37:32.328
And not once,
have you come to me and complained.

37:32.849 --> 37:35.330
And then... Then you got it
where you protected my daughter,

37:35.591 --> 37:37.565
and you're not letting me
think bad of her.

37:37.725 --> 37:40.544
And again, you don't say a word.
Not a word.

37:41.107 --> 37:43.798
And I'll tell you something,
not as a coach, but as a father...

37:44.298 --> 37:46.342
You realize
what an honorable thing that is?

37:46.914 --> 37:48.468
That is very honorable.

37:49.662 --> 37:50.912
Thank you, sir.

37:52.622 --> 37:53.622
All right.

37:53.944 --> 37:55.066
Rest this weekend.

37:55.226 --> 37:56.769
- Will do, coach.
- Betcha, buddy.

37:57.467 --> 37:58.467
You betcha.

38:00.359 --> 38:02.066
What's your game plan with that burger?

38:02.327 --> 38:03.900
Cool out, just cool out.

38:09.279 --> 38:10.302
Hey, Smash.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.952
- Congratulations. Good game last night.
- Oh, thank you.

38:13.265 --> 38:14.907
You got a minute?
Can we talk?

38:15.067 --> 38:17.247
Yeah, sure, I got a minute.
Yes, sir.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.672
You were really good last night.
You really played well.

38:25.180 --> 38:28.801
And I'm here because we want you
to play football for us at TMU.

38:29.316 --> 38:30.972
We're offering you a full scholarship.

38:31.132 --> 38:34.723
And all we need to get this done is
for you to give me a verbal commitment.

38:38.991 --> 38:40.770
Yeah, but there's no reason
to rush, right?

38:41.115 --> 38:43.301
I mean, we need to talk
about the fine print.

38:43.461 --> 38:46.962
Well, the fine print is this:
it's gonna get down to trust.

38:47.122 --> 38:48.404
Who are you gonna trust?

38:48.830 --> 38:51.574
No other program is gonna work harder
at getting you to the NFL.

38:52.147 --> 38:55.458
That's why we recruit so well:
we get guys to the NFL.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.014
All we need you to do, come play for us,

38:58.174 --> 38:59.915
work hard, earn your spot,

39:00.176 --> 39:02.208
and I promise you
you'll get a shot at the pros.

39:03.395 --> 39:06.214
Trust me.
If you trust me, we can make it happen.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.925
Well, thanks.
I'm real glad we had this talk.

39:10.526 --> 39:11.677
Thank you.
I'm too.

39:12.198 --> 39:14.523
- I'm gonna be waiting to hear from you.
- Okay.

39:16.859 --> 39:20.143
Of course you know, it's always been
my dream to play for TMU.

39:20.405 --> 39:22.714
Can I take that as a verbal commitment?

39:28.982 --> 39:31.322
Hey, y'all, the Smash is gonna
play for the "U," baby!

39:37.213 --> 39:39.164
- All right.
- I'll take care of you.

39:39.422 --> 39:40.920
I won't let you down.

39:44.385 --> 39:45.835
How you doin', baby?

39:47.459 --> 39:49.297
I gotta go tell my mom, yeah.

39:49.457 --> 39:51.592
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right, go, Smash.

39:54.361 --> 39:55.587
Turn that off.

39:57.392 --> 39:58.523
Slide over.

40:03.604 --> 40:06.065
I cannot tell you
how disappointed I am in you.

40:06.754 --> 40:09.599
You lied about Tim Riggins,
you lied to me, you lied to your mother,

40:09.759 --> 40:12.196
and that's something
we don't teach in this family.

40:12.772 --> 40:14.282
I don't know when it is

40:14.542 --> 40:16.680
I'm gonna be able to trust you again.

40:18.176 --> 40:19.826
I'm beyond angry, honey.

40:20.083 --> 40:23.449
I think the best word to describe it
would be "hurt."

40:24.841 --> 40:27.961
As far as you drinking...
You're too young.

40:28.937 --> 40:30.694
You, your mother and I
are gonna sit down

40:30.854 --> 40:34.737
and have a talk about that as soon
as she and I sort this whole thing out.

40:35.216 --> 40:37.263
And I think she would also
want me to tell you

40:37.524 --> 40:38.606
that, yes...

40:39.189 --> 40:41.285
people do make mistakes...

40:42.411 --> 40:44.292
and I understand that too.

40:45.229 --> 40:46.902
I love you so much...

40:48.135 --> 40:50.263
and that will never change.

40:54.947 --> 40:55.948
<i>Capiche</i> ?

40:57.164 --> 40:58.165
<i>Capiche</i>.

41:01.269 --> 41:02.269
Hey, babe.

41:03.803 --> 41:06.101
- Everything's all right here?
- Everything's just fine.

41:06.261 --> 41:08.075
How is your sister doing?

41:08.235 --> 41:09.660
She is doing all right.

41:09.820 --> 41:11.047
She's gonna be great.

41:11.583 --> 41:12.687
Movie night?

41:13.009 --> 41:14.508
- What are we gonna see?
- Great.

41:14.769 --> 41:18.098
I rented this movie
from the library: <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.346
It's mama's choice.
Let's watch <i>Foul Play</i> again.

41:20.885 --> 41:23.100
All right, it's mom's choice.
<i>Foul Play</i> tonight.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.820
- I'll get the popcorn.
- Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase.

41:26.134 --> 41:27.493
Go see your daddy.

41:36.054 --> 41:39.044
But I'm making butter, real butter.
It's gotta be real butter.

41:39.308 --> 41:43.303
Now, this is the most important thing
that a man can...

41:43.463 --> 41:44.642
What are you doing?

41:44.802 --> 41:46.374
Ooh, don't hit yourself.

41:52.528 --> 41:55.758
Take them damn shoes off. You know
I just scrubbed this floor yesterday.

41:58.742 --> 42:00.846
- What is this?
- I'm in, mom.

42:01.254 --> 42:03.224
I'm going to TMU.
They want me.

42:07.467 --> 42:10.481
- You sure that's what you want?
- Yes, ma'am.

42:15.537 --> 42:16.542
Oh, baby!

42:18.781 --> 42:20.031
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
