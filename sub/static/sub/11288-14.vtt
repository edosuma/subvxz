Hello, my happy housemates!
I'm home!

(Khadijah)
'Regine, you are the most
connivin' person on the planet'

00:08.173 --> 00:10.977
(Regine)
'Well, at least I don't think
I'm queen of the planet.'

00:11.044 --> 00:12.345
'Let's set it on.'

00:14.280 --> 00:16.717
Ooh, sounds like somethin' salty
is going on in the kitchen.

00:16.783 --> 00:19.252
See, no, now, you only care
about three people.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.254
‐ Oh!
‐ Regine, Regine!

00:21.321 --> 00:22.723
And Regine's wig maker.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.828
Well, if that were true,
would I be standing here

00:27.894 --> 00:30.697
listening to you bark
like a harbor seal!

00:30.764 --> 00:32.566
Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:32.633 --> 00:34.701
Whoa, whoa, you two.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.002
No, about that..

00:36.069 --> 00:38.639
Regine stole grandma's
secret raisin cookie recipe

00:38.705 --> 00:39.973
to win a contest.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.374
Well, congratulations, Regine

00:41.441 --> 00:42.876
and shame on you!

00:44.711 --> 00:46.680
I didn't steal nothin'.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.849
Now, this is my own recipe

00:48.915 --> 00:51.718
for Regine's raisin smooches.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.356
Taste this and tell me
that's not one of my mom's

00:56.422 --> 00:57.524
raisin lumps.

01:03.003 --> 01:04.538
Oh, oh, oh, wait, now.
That's a lump.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.807

Are you familiar with the show

02:11.277 --> 02:12.546
"Curly's Cartoon Caboose?"

02:12.613 --> 02:15.448
Oh, I love
that adorable little moppet.

02:15.516 --> 02:16.650
His taste in cartoons

02:16.716 --> 02:19.085
is both whimsical and eclectic.

02:19.152 --> 02:21.688
Well, look, I had a long talk
today with Jonathan Remington.

02:21.755 --> 02:23.356
He's one of our
big money clients.

02:23.423 --> 02:25.091
And his company
produces the show.

02:25.158 --> 02:26.593
And check it out, it seems
they're havin' a hard time

02:26.660 --> 02:28.929
finding a replacement
for Curly's sidekick

02:28.995 --> 02:30.096
Boxcar Bernie.

02:30.163 --> 02:31.497
Boxcar Bernie's gone?

02:32.933 --> 02:35.268
I loved that homeless clown.

02:35.335 --> 02:37.103
Yeah, well,
apparently so did the prostitute

02:37.170 --> 02:38.404
they found him with.

02:40.541 --> 02:44.578
Anyway, I told him that
my good friend Synclairebelle

02:44.645 --> 02:46.212
would be perfect for the part.

02:46.279 --> 02:47.814
Yeah, baby,
your audition's on Monday.

02:47.881 --> 02:49.650
‐ Oh, Kyle, are you serious?
‐ Ha ha ha! Yes!

02:49.716 --> 02:51.451
I get a real audition
on a real TV show?

02:51.518 --> 02:52.886
‐ Yes!
‐ I don't know how to thank you!

02:52.953 --> 02:55.922
Oh! You alright, man,
you alright.

02:55.989 --> 02:57.858

02:57.924 --> 03:00.867
Um, I'd love to go with you,
my Harlequin honey

03:00.934 --> 03:03.036
but, um, haven't
completely conquered

03:03.103 --> 03:04.905
my fear of...clowns.

03:06.206 --> 03:08.441
How come you're able to watch
Boxcar Bernie?

03:08.509 --> 03:10.677
Oh, yeah, baby,
that's a TV clown.

03:10.744 --> 03:12.378
Not like it could
reach through the screen

03:12.445 --> 03:13.880
and rip out my soul.

03:15.749 --> 03:16.917
No!

03:17.984 --> 03:19.653
‐ Hey!
‐ You know, Regine.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.121
My mom‐mom's
gonna be out all day

03:26.126 --> 03:28.228
Good and while I'm at her house

03:28.294 --> 03:30.463
I'll steal her shawl
and her dentures..

03:30.531 --> 03:31.965
Oh, and I'm sure

03:32.032 --> 03:34.367
her heart medication
has a high street value.

03:37.771 --> 03:39.740
Well, seems
I've taken a little trip

03:39.806 --> 03:41.975
to Sarcastic Ville.

03:42.042 --> 03:44.911
Look, I am right
and she is wrong.

03:44.978 --> 03:47.881
And before she gives you the
twisted version of the facts.

03:47.948 --> 03:50.050
Let me give you
the objective story.

03:54.821 --> 03:56.222
Smooches!

that you've taken my turn

04:03.937 --> 04:07.040
vacuuming every week
since I've been here.

04:07.107 --> 04:09.910
But you're not doing
as thorough a job as I would do

04:09.976 --> 04:11.244
if I did it.

04:12.579 --> 04:14.180
Oh, fair enough!

04:14.247 --> 04:16.082
I'll redo it as soon
as I take your turn

scrubbin' the floors.

04:21.353 --> 04:22.789
Hey, listen..

04:22.856 --> 04:24.991
How can I make
my raisin cookies better

04:25.058 --> 04:26.760
to win this baking contest?

04:26.827 --> 04:29.262
Do you have any ideas
I can call my own?

04:29.329 --> 04:32.132
Well.. My mom‐mom
puts prune juice

04:32.198 --> 04:33.499
in her raisin cookies.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.569
But don't steal her recipe.

04:35.635 --> 04:36.870
I repeat!

04:36.936 --> 04:38.738
"Don't steal her recipe."

Oh, Khadijah..

to get my own plum sauce.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.574
It's good to know
I can sponge off of you two

havin' to pay you back.

how it happened.

his work boots.

to calm you down?

09:43.276 --> 09:46.179
Why, I would never steal
from your mom‐mom.

09:46.246 --> 09:48.448
Oh, well, that's,
that's as far into me

09:48.515 --> 09:50.183
as, as demon gossip.

09:51.618 --> 09:52.553
[chuckles]
Yo!

09:52.619 --> 09:54.821
Speaking of winnin'..

09:54.888 --> 09:56.489
You know I have a great career

09:56.557 --> 09:57.924
and you don't.

09:57.991 --> 10:00.527
Plus, I date a doctor.

10:00.594 --> 10:03.504
And you? You don't even have
a boyfriend.

10:04.838 --> 10:08.441
God bless you,
my hip hop friend.

10:08.509 --> 10:09.943
Wohoo!

10:10.010 --> 10:11.077
Hey, people!

10:12.012 --> 10:13.213
I'm too lazy to go to the store

10:13.279 --> 10:15.949
to get my own plum sauce.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.251
It's good to know
I can sponge off of you two

10:18.318 --> 10:22.222
without ever havin'
to pay you back.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.389
Suckers.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.360
[humming]

10:28.862 --> 10:30.597
Mm.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.600
Lord, I thank you
for the gift of baking.

10:38.539 --> 10:39.740
Now, that's what happened.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.108
Regine, I do not talk like that.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.711
Your story is whack.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.013
Now, I know
you're not calling me a liar.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.716
You better give my mom‐mom
credit for those cookies.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.984
Fine!
You're right.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.118
I will give her credit.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.521
Oh, damn!
There I go lying again.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.624
Lenny!

10:58.992 --> 11:01.167
You know I don't allow
any kids on my set.

11:01.234 --> 11:03.003
Except for the bleachers.

11:05.071 --> 11:06.707
They might touch me.

11:06.773 --> 11:07.908
That's Steve Keppy.

11:07.974 --> 11:09.810
He's the president
of your fan club.

11:09.876 --> 11:11.778
Oh!

11:11.845 --> 11:13.246
Steve!

11:14.147 --> 11:15.816
Uh..

11:15.882 --> 11:17.350
Nice to see you again.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.786
Hey, maybe later we can play
a little Hacky Sack.

11:20.787 --> 11:21.788
Bounce him.

11:23.657 --> 11:24.858
Twenty seconds, everybody.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.093
Lenny!

11:27.160 --> 11:28.729
What monkey painted this crap?

11:28.795 --> 11:30.697
Rita, the orphan,
the show sponsors.

11:31.798 --> 11:33.433
Oh! I'm sorry.

11:33.499 --> 11:35.368
Did I say "Monkey?"

11:35.435 --> 11:39.105
I meant, talentless,
parentless monkey.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.273
Lose it!

11:41.942 --> 11:45.011
But I told her
we'd show her paintings.

11:45.078 --> 11:46.479
Well, show her your pink slip

11:46.547 --> 11:47.881
because you're fired!

11:49.750 --> 11:51.284
Hey, Curly.

11:51.351 --> 11:53.319
You can't fire the director!

11:53.386 --> 11:55.255
Listen, you circus reject.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.826
This is
"Curly's Cartoon Caboose."

11:59.893 --> 12:01.835
I can do anything I want.

12:01.902 --> 12:03.970
The only reason he's
the director in the first place

12:04.037 --> 12:05.639
is because he's my father.

12:08.675 --> 12:10.410
Oh, man, turn it up,
here come my baby.

12:10.476 --> 12:13.246
You pint sized dictator

12:13.313 --> 12:15.381
I've got a mind
to take you over my knees

12:15.448 --> 12:17.884
and spank your behind,
you little freckle face.

12:17.951 --> 12:19.319
Oh! Hello!

12:20.386 --> 12:21.588
Clown!

12:22.022 --> 12:23.690
Bad!

12:23.757 --> 12:25.191
Yell at children!

12:31.097 --> 12:32.032
[door opens]

12:32.098 --> 12:33.634
Obie. Synclaire's back!

12:33.700 --> 12:36.002
(Obie)
'Clown!'

12:36.069 --> 12:38.438
Overton, she has taken off
the make‐up.

12:43.376 --> 12:45.078
What happened, baby.
Did they fire you?

12:45.145 --> 12:46.780
I didn't give 'em the chance.

12:46.847 --> 12:48.214
Soon as I heard
the opening strings

12:48.281 --> 12:49.750
of Snagglepuss

12:49.816 --> 12:52.653
I exited stage right.

12:52.719 --> 12:54.855
Yeah, well,
thanks to your little outburst

12:54.921 --> 12:57.357
my firm may lose
Remington's millions.

12:57.423 --> 13:00.727
And I will be shunned by
upper and lower echelons alike.

13:00.794 --> 13:02.368
The elevator operator
will no longer say

13:02.435 --> 13:03.537
"Fourteenth floor, Mr. Barker."

13:03.604 --> 13:05.205
Oh, no, no, hell, no.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.810
We'll just ride in icy silence.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.745
Well, I'm, I'm sure my baby
had good reason

13:11.812 --> 13:15.348
to humiliate a loveable
12‐yeur‐old kid on TV.

13:15.415 --> 13:17.450
There was no excuse
for my behavior.

13:17.518 --> 13:19.986
All Curly did was boot
an innocent kid into the gutter

13:20.053 --> 13:22.422
fire his father
and make fun of an orphan.

13:22.488 --> 13:24.457
Shoot, if I woulda
acted like that

13:24.525 --> 13:27.293
my mother woulda had
a long talk with me.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.429
And I'm not talking
about the kinda talk

13:29.495 --> 13:31.231
that involves talkin'.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.602
Is this how
I'm gonna be with my child?

13:35.669 --> 13:38.271
I mean, scream at him
at the slightest provocation?

13:38.338 --> 13:40.507
Oh, baby, our twins

13:40.574 --> 13:41.975
Syncloverton and..

13:43.143 --> 13:44.344
...Overclaire.

13:46.379 --> 13:48.849
They'll have more respect
for authority, baby.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.416
[telephone ringing]

13:50.483 --> 13:51.618
I'll get that.

13:51.685 --> 13:53.486
Yeah, but with names like that

13:53.554 --> 13:55.689
whose gonna have
any respect for them?

13:57.791 --> 13:59.993
Yes!
I'll be there!

14:00.060 --> 14:01.134
They want me back!

14:01.201 --> 14:02.869
‐ Oh!
‐ They want me back!

14:02.936 --> 14:04.538
[laughing]

14:05.138 --> 14:06.206
Oh! Oh!

14:06.272 --> 14:08.074
Once Curly dried his tears

14:08.141 --> 14:11.712
he told Lenny that my honesty
was like a breath of fresh air.

14:11.778 --> 14:13.747
He's even gonna give
Lenny his job back.

14:13.814 --> 14:16.116
Oh, but, bad news, Khadijah.

14:16.182 --> 14:20.286
I might not be able
to come to work tomorrow.

14:20.353 --> 14:21.722
[giggling]
You'll be missed.

14:26.159 --> 14:29.062
Alright, you, now I have baked
my cookies again

14:29.129 --> 14:32.666
to prove to you, that I did not
steal your mom‐mom's recipe.

14:32.733 --> 14:35.669
You'll find
not one trace of prune juice

14:35.736 --> 14:37.270
and yet they taste exactly..

14:39.305 --> 14:41.307
‐ Different.
‐ I stand corrected.

14:41.374 --> 14:43.076
You're not a thief,
you're a lousy thief.

14:46.079 --> 14:47.413
What the hell do you want?

14:48.615 --> 14:49.583
To use your plum sauce

14:49.650 --> 14:51.752
and for you to move to Alaska.

14:54.521 --> 14:56.923
Max, you're spillin' that sauce

14:56.990 --> 14:58.559
over Regine's cookies dough!

14:59.693 --> 15:01.134
Sorry.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.235
Sorry.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.572
When was the last time
you had Moo Shu?

15:05.639 --> 15:07.107
[clicks tongue]
Last night.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.408
About 3 a. m.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.443
(Khadijah)
'No, before that.'

15:10.511 --> 15:12.312
Oh, my goodness, uh,
two days ago.

15:13.647 --> 15:15.348
Wait a minute, that's it.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.318
You dripped that stuff
into my dough.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.554
That's where
the prune flavor came from.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.256
Oh!

15:25.526 --> 15:26.860
Got any Chinese mustard?

15:29.963 --> 15:32.098
You know, Khadijah, nothing
says, I'm sorry

15:32.165 --> 15:34.768
like a Valentino gown.

15:34.835 --> 15:37.437
You can't blame me
for thinkin' you did it.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.440
It's not like you above
pulling a quick okey‐doke.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.409
Oh. Foo‐foo Poupon.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.779
Chinese mustard!

15:47.113 --> 15:50.951
You name one time
I pulled an okey‐doke.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.554
Last week when it was
your turn to do the laundry.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.055
You rubbed Bounce over it

15:55.121 --> 15:56.322
and folded it back up.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.935
And I thought
you had faith in me.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.770
Well, how about
I just move into a sewer

16:03.837 --> 16:05.672
with a band
of pickpockets, huh?

16:05.739 --> 16:07.207
At least they'll trust me.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.109
I'll help you pack.

16:09.175 --> 16:10.410
Alright, let me settle this.

16:11.578 --> 16:12.679
Regine.

16:12.746 --> 16:13.780
You're feelings are hurt

16:13.847 --> 16:16.517
because Khadijah
accused you of lying.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.553
Khadijah, you accused Regine
of lying because she lies.

16:21.287 --> 16:22.723
Easy solution.

16:22.789 --> 16:24.591
Regine, don't lie.
Khadijah, don't care.

16:24.658 --> 16:25.626
Now.

16:25.692 --> 16:27.628
Now that I've..

16:27.694 --> 16:28.762
...solved

16:28.829 --> 16:30.063
the mystery of the, uh

16:30.130 --> 16:31.765
pruny smooches.

16:31.832 --> 16:33.967
Can I please get
some Chinese mustard?

16:35.068 --> 16:36.970
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.672
You come up in the house

16:38.739 --> 16:41.407
spilling the sauce
all in the dough..

16:41.474 --> 16:44.044
Start this big fight
between Regine and I.

16:44.110 --> 16:45.411
And you're telling us

16:45.478 --> 16:46.880
how to respect
each other's space?

16:46.947 --> 16:49.616
Well, someone's gotta be the
voice of reason in this house.

16:50.584 --> 16:52.118
And, look..

16:52.185 --> 16:55.288
If you expect me to go out
and get some Chinese mustard

16:55.355 --> 16:56.489
I'm gonna need some money.

17:00.366 --> 17:01.467
Oh, Obie

17:01.535 --> 17:03.169
it means so much to me
that you came down

17:03.236 --> 17:04.838
despite your fear of clowns.

17:04.905 --> 17:06.472
Oh, my bodacious bozo.

17:06.540 --> 17:09.442
My love for you is much stronger
than any old phobia.

17:09.510 --> 17:10.544
Aw!

17:10.611 --> 17:12.713
Clown! Clown!

17:12.779 --> 17:14.314
I‐I got this, Synclaire,
I got this.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.116
Yeah, alright!
Man, check it out, check it out.

17:16.182 --> 17:17.851
I've kept Remington as a client.

17:17.917 --> 17:20.086
Yeah, I told him that
Synclairebelle's outburst

17:20.153 --> 17:21.253
was an isolated incident

17:21.320 --> 17:22.723
and that she was
much too professional

17:22.789 --> 17:23.824
to ever let it happen again.

17:23.890 --> 17:25.157
‐ Oh!
‐ Barker!

17:25.224 --> 17:26.492
I hope you're right
about that clown

17:26.560 --> 17:27.728
being back on her medication.

17:29.195 --> 17:31.197
And we're on in five

17:31.264 --> 17:34.000
four, three, two..

17:34.067 --> 17:36.236
[instrumental music on set]

17:37.838 --> 17:39.239
Hey, kids!

17:39.305 --> 17:42.242
And hop on
to "Curly's Cartoon Caboose."

17:42.308 --> 17:45.946
I'm Curly and this is
Synclairebelle the Clown.

17:46.012 --> 17:47.948
[cheering and applause]

17:48.982 --> 17:49.950
Woo! Woo!

17:50.016 --> 17:52.853
Hey, down! Wow, woo! Woo! Woo!

17:53.887 --> 17:55.455
Hiya, kids!

17:55.522 --> 17:57.423
(all)
Hi!

17:57.490 --> 17:59.660
Hello, Curly.

17:59.726 --> 18:02.202
Why, these are for you.

18:02.268 --> 18:04.004
Presto‐chango.

18:04.070 --> 18:05.906
[kids cheering]

18:07.373 --> 18:09.510
What do you mean,
"Presto chango?"

18:09.576 --> 18:12.178
You had 'em
stashed up your sleeve.

18:12.245 --> 18:13.647
[cheering]

18:13.714 --> 18:14.981
Fine.

18:15.048 --> 18:18.752
Yes! Well, now it's time
for magic trick number one.

18:18.819 --> 18:20.320
Ta‐da!

18:20.386 --> 18:22.322
‐ 'Yes!'
‐ Da da. Da da da.

18:22.388 --> 18:24.290
Da da da da, dada‐da.

18:24.357 --> 18:25.759
See the egg and

18:25.826 --> 18:28.328
now you don't, hey.

18:28.394 --> 18:33.634
‐ Presto‐chango.
‐ Yeah!

18:33.700 --> 18:36.002
Presto‐lamo.

18:36.069 --> 18:38.672
[laughing]

18:38.739 --> 18:42.308
Sorry Synclairebelle is
such a big disappointment, kids.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.410
But when we come back
from this commercial

18:44.477 --> 18:47.447
we're gonna play a little game
of Simon Says.

18:47.514 --> 18:49.683
And we're not gonna let
Synclairebelle mess it up.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.918
‐ Are we?
‐ No!

18:52.853 --> 18:54.054
And we're clear.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.289
Why'd you do that?

18:56.356 --> 18:59.993
It's not fun being humiliated
in front of everyone, is it?

19:00.060 --> 19:03.469
Well, I'm just getting started,
you daisy‐headed freak.

19:05.371 --> 19:07.173
I'll see he's never
going to make it to puberty

19:07.240 --> 19:08.742
that Choo‐Choo Charlie..

19:10.677 --> 19:12.879
Baby, look, I ain't never hit
a kid before

19:12.946 --> 19:14.981
but you say the word
on his 18th birthday..

19:15.048 --> 19:16.950
Booyah!

19:17.017 --> 19:18.685
Oh, that's okay, Overton.

19:18.752 --> 19:20.721
Look, look, Synclaire, don't
feel you have to take this abuse

19:20.787 --> 19:22.055
just because of me, alright?

19:22.122 --> 19:24.290
Yeah, that account might mean
millions to his firm

19:24.357 --> 19:25.859
but it is not worth
your dignity.

19:25.926 --> 19:27.661
Right, Kyle?

19:27.728 --> 19:29.062
[mumbling]
Of course, not.

19:29.129 --> 19:31.231
Um, you've never seen
a million dollars in one place

19:31.297 --> 19:32.699
have you, Overton?

19:32.766 --> 19:34.935
Oh, thanks, Kyle.

19:35.001 --> 19:36.537
If somebody
doesn't stand up to him

19:36.603 --> 19:38.672
he's gonna grow up to be
arrogant, disrespectful

19:38.739 --> 19:39.873
and whiny.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.274
And we're back in five..

19:41.341 --> 19:43.744
four, three, two..

19:44.578 --> 19:46.246
Hey, kids!

19:46.312 --> 19:48.649
Now, it's time to play
"Simon Says."

19:48.715 --> 19:50.817
That right, Simon says
put your hand on your head.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.418
[giggling]

19:52.485 --> 19:53.654
Synclairebelle?

19:54.521 --> 19:55.856
I'm Simon.

19:55.922 --> 19:57.658
I'm always Simon.

19:57.724 --> 19:59.292
Well, of course you are.

19:59.359 --> 20:02.002
But you're the one that told me
that it's fair to take turns.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.138
So, Simon says,
put your hand on your head.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.472
[honking]

20:08.108 --> 20:09.543
Oh, very good, Curly.

20:09.610 --> 20:12.613
And now Simon says,
dance like a ballerina.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.217
Aw, come on, Curly,
you know the rules.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.451
Dance like a ballerina.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.789
[cheering]

20:27.694 --> 20:29.896
Bravo, Baryshnikov!

20:29.963 --> 20:33.199
But I didn't say Simon says,
you lose!

20:33.266 --> 20:34.668
You lose!

20:34.735 --> 20:36.169
[laughing]

20:36.236 --> 20:37.771
Alright, you're through.

20:37.838 --> 20:39.506
Get off my stage,
you jackass.

20:39.573 --> 20:40.807
Oh!

20:40.874 --> 20:42.375
Hey, boys and girls

20:42.442 --> 20:44.645
Curly is just showing you
the way not to act.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.812
Aren't you, Curly?

20:45.879 --> 20:47.280
Alright!

20:47.347 --> 20:48.715
‐ Ha ha ha.
‐ Let's watch a cartoon.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.784
‐ Yeah!
‐ Let's watch a cartoon.

20:51.952 --> 20:53.319
What the hell was that?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.088
I'm tryin' to teach
you something, young man.

20:55.155 --> 20:56.890
If you don't like
being treated badly

20:56.957 --> 20:58.792
then maybe you shouldn't do it
to other people, got it?

20:59.359 --> 21:00.433
Get this..

21:00.500 --> 21:01.802
Simon says

21:01.868 --> 21:03.136
you're fired!

21:04.838 --> 21:06.339
‐ Wait a minute, Curly!
‐ What?

21:07.874 --> 21:09.810
Man, I can't let it end
like this.

21:14.781 --> 21:16.717
[cheering]

21:17.751 --> 21:20.153
Now, I can end it!

21:20.220 --> 21:21.421
[honking]

21:23.757 --> 21:25.692
[indistinct chattering]

21:26.560 --> 21:27.894
Ah!

21:28.862 --> 21:30.263
[cheering and applause]

21:39.372 --> 21:40.974
[theme music]

22:09.776 --> 22:10.777
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>

22:10.844 --> 22:11.778
[woman chuckles]
