WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.507
Catch all-new episodes Sundays
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.509 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.480
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.482 --> 00:15.714
Only on Fox.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.761
(exclaiming)

00:33.199 --> 00:35.234
(school bell ringing)

00:37.804 --> 00:38.971
(Barney belches)

00:38.973 --> 00:41.306
(whistle blows)

00:41.308 --> 00:43.375
LENNY:
Oh, not again!

00:47.514 --> 00:48.914
(beeping)

00:53.987 --> 00:55.587
(playing theremin)

01:00.493 --> 01:01.593
(tires screeching)

01:03.396 --> 01:04.396
D'oh!

01:04.398 --> 01:05.664
(tires screeching)

01:05.666 --> 01:07.066
(grunts)

01:07.068 --> 01:09.268
(soft, whimsical music)

01:13.239 --> 01:14.907
(phone line ringing)
Eh, hello?

01:17.010 --> 01:18.844
Bart!
(cash register dings)

01:18.846 --> 01:20.345
Hell no!

01:20.347 --> 01:21.413
D'oh!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.283
(crumpling paper)

01:26.419 --> 01:28.020
(thudding, can opening)

01:28.022 --> 01:29.221
(popping, crunching sound)
HOMER: Mmm.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.589
(clock ticking)

01:30.591 --> 01:31.757
(grunts)

01:34.094 --> 01:35.360
HOMER:
D'oh!

01:35.362 --> 01:37.529
(clock ticking, bell chimes)

01:37.531 --> 01:38.730
(snoring)
Homer.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.699
(shrieks)
Do something.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.601
(laughs)

01:42.603 --> 01:44.403
(pop, thud)

01:44.405 --> 01:45.771
(glass shattering)

01:50.410 --> 01:51.944
(distressed sounds)

01:55.882 --> 01:57.182
(twinkle sound)

02:06.259 --> 02:07.926
(whistle blows)
LENNY: <i>Quittin' time!</i>

02:07.928 --> 02:09.094
CARL:
Quittin' time.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.262
HOMER:
Thank God it's Friday.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.630
LENNY:
Thursday.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.998
HOMER:
Same thing. See you Monday.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.103
Marge, baby, I'm out the door.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.738
Are you sure?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.907
Because sometimes people say
they're out the door

02:21.909 --> 02:23.775
when they really
haven't left yet.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.578
Those people are horrible,
horrible liars.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.913
See you soon.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.781
Simpson, not so fast.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.117
Hold up one end of this poster.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.919
Now use it to conceal this.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.255
(air hissing)

02:36.257 --> 02:37.589
Excellent.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.458
Now, let me just
crank up the plumb bob

02:39.460 --> 02:40.959
to determine the vertical.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.594
(crank squeaking)

02:42.596 --> 02:44.630
(chuckles)
With this mechanical marvel,

02:44.632 --> 02:47.499
we'll have this poster
level in under three hours.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.800
(chuckles)

02:48.802 --> 02:52.271
(crank continues squeaking)
(Homer whimpers)

02:52.273 --> 02:53.805
Ooh, and for a
little excitement,

02:53.807 --> 02:56.108
how about a plumb bob song?

02:56.110 --> 02:57.976
Uh...
(stammers)

02:57.978 --> 03:00.512
All right.
Um...

03:00.514 --> 03:02.314
♪ One must never, never

03:02.316 --> 03:03.815
♪ Never rush

03:03.817 --> 03:05.517
♪ The plumb bob

03:05.519 --> 03:07.186
♪ Slow is the way

03:07.188 --> 03:10.322
♪ The only way to go

03:10.324 --> 03:12.624
♪ Clear your schedule

03:12.626 --> 03:15.994
♪ Before you use the plumb bob

03:15.996 --> 03:18.163
♪ Yes, the plumb bob

03:18.165 --> 03:21.133
♪ Is mighty, mighty

03:21.135 --> 03:23.669
♪ Mighty

03:23.671 --> 03:27.539
(drawn out):
♪ Slow...

03:27.541 --> 03:32.044
(carrying note)

03:32.046 --> 03:33.478
MARGE:
Okay.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.680
Maggie's had her bath,

03:34.682 --> 03:37.015
dinner's on the stove.
Hmm.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.884
Dare I pop a cork?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.352
(magical gliss)

03:40.354 --> 03:41.820
(British accent):
Give me a spin, Marge.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.021
You're so deft.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.557
Not like... (shudders) him.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.159
Mom. Mom!

03:47.161 --> 03:49.728
My costume for the
science play is all wrong!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.530
You said you were a seahorse.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.864
A  <i>male</i>seahorse.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.166
With a pouch.

03:54.168 --> 03:55.867
Males have pouches?

03:55.869 --> 03:59.404
Male seahorse's nurturing is one
of the wonders of the world.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.373
You said you read the script.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.175
Bart gave me a synopsis.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.409
I... (groans)

04:04.411 --> 04:06.211
Oh, boy.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.313
(garage door opening
and closing)
Oh, now what?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.323
Eat your carrot and pea medley.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.927
(groans)

04:21.929 --> 04:23.395
Mom, I'll clean
that up for you.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.763
Oh, thank God, some help.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.898
Where's the mop?
In the mop closet.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.735
Where's the bucket?
Under the mop.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.870
Other closet.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.105
There's stuff in front of it.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.073
(loud groan)

04:35.075 --> 04:36.441
Let me help.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.612
(bubbling, fizzing)
Ay, caramba!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.248
Hey, there's wood
underneath this linoleum.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.585
Oh!
Just go play outside.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.586
Outside? Your loss.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.421
(Bart humming happily)

04:49.423 --> 04:51.490
(children chattering)

04:53.726 --> 04:55.994
I do not get what kids
see in these places.
(humming)

04:58.264 --> 05:01.300
(clanking)

05:01.302 --> 05:02.634
It's the genie of the sub.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.069
Genie? I wish.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.570
You get a lamp and a carpet,

05:05.572 --> 05:07.239
which is more than
I've got in here.

05:07.241 --> 05:09.274
Hmm, didn't know this place
was filled with such losers.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.475
Hey, Martin.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.977
Bartholomew!

05:11.979 --> 05:15.147
This playground has safely
stimulated my imagination.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.449
What the hell are
you talking about?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.618
Martin.
(chuckles)

05:19.620 --> 05:21.620
Who's your new friend?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.822
(whispers):
Mother, don't blow this for me.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.958
Fine, I'll just go sit
and talk to his mother.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.160
Where is she?

05:28.162 --> 05:29.494
I'm here by myself.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.463
But I have a safety number.
(phone line ringing)

05:31.465 --> 05:32.764
MOE:
Moe's Tavern.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.965
Homer ain't here.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.334
And for once, that's the truth.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.136
(keys beeping)

05:38.138 --> 05:39.805
(siren wailing)

05:39.807 --> 05:41.606
(tires screech, siren stops)

05:41.608 --> 05:44.509
Simpson, are you
here unsupervised?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.345
Yeah. And so what?

05:46.347 --> 05:49.848
I'd lose the attitude,
"Sylvester Alone."

05:49.850 --> 05:51.183
(chuckles)

05:51.185 --> 05:53.318
Finally, a laugh out of Lou.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.121
Son, kids aren't allowed
on their own anymore.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.823
Now, who said you
could come here?

05:57.825 --> 05:58.990
My mom.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.827
Ugh. Always the mom.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.161
(siren wailing)

06:03.163 --> 06:04.463
(Flanders yells,
tires screech)

06:04.465 --> 06:07.165
(grunting)

06:07.167 --> 06:08.367
(screams)

06:08.369 --> 06:09.668
She's got needles.

06:09.670 --> 06:15.707
(clicking)

06:15.709 --> 06:18.310
(exhales)
What did Bart do now?

06:18.312 --> 06:19.644
I was playing
nicely in the park.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.646
Bart, how could you... What?

06:21.648 --> 06:23.515
Your children
need to be supervised.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.183
Take her away, boys.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.686
If you take me away, then
who's gonna watch my kids?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.154
You should've thought of that

06:29.156 --> 06:31.356
before we showed up
unannounced.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.525
What, Marge?

06:33.527 --> 06:34.893
You're being arrested?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.862
I'm afraid so, Mr. Simpson.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.698
A mother at the park saw
something she disapproved of.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.734
And luckily for your son,
she overreacted.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.803
♪

06:47.039 --> 06:49.608
I, uh...
I get carsick in the front.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.112
(Wiggum chuckles)

07:00.086 --> 07:01.420
Our top story,
a Springfield mother

07:01.422 --> 07:04.055
has been arrested for
an outrageous "negligée."

07:04.057 --> 07:05.357
The...

07:05.359 --> 07:07.225
Sorry, I'm being told
it's negligence.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.594
Which is very boring.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.229
Judge, I don't understand.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.732
When I was a kid,
we used to go out and play

07:13.734 --> 07:15.600
and not come home until dark.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.935
I see.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.570
Bailiff, incarcerate
Marge Simpsons' mother.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.571
(squeaks)

07:19.573 --> 07:21.940
Thanks for
ratting me out, Marge.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.942
(muffled talking)

07:23.944 --> 07:25.710
With all due respect, Judge,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.212
this is wackadoodle.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.915
Nobody cares about
their kids more than I do.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.216
Liar.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.617
Marge is right, Your Honor.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.619
My e-mail password
is "bad dad."

07:34.621 --> 07:36.087
(gallery gasps)
Yeah, Judge.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.422
If you want to know
who should be in jail,

07:37.424 --> 07:40.959
he weighs 240
and smells like onions.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.894
It is not within
the purview of this court

07:42.896 --> 07:45.430
to determine how fat
and smelly your father may be.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.431
Woo-hoo!

07:46.433 --> 07:47.966
Mrs. Simpsons, 90 days.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.668
(gasps)

07:53.272 --> 07:54.806
This is Kafkaesque.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.107
Kafkaesque!

07:56.109 --> 07:57.442
I've got my eye on you.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.044
Now it's Orwellian.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.616
(hinges squeaking)

08:04.618 --> 08:05.817
Hey, kitties.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.085
You got a new
ball of yarn.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.286
(hinges squeak,
door slams)

08:08.288 --> 08:11.790
Oh, that guard
is awfully slammy.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.291
Newbies on top.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.360
Oh.
Where's the ladder?

08:16.829 --> 08:19.164
Have you been claimed yet?

08:19.166 --> 08:19.965
Claimed?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.166
By one of the book clubs.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.601
(sighs)

08:22.603 --> 08:24.302
Yeah, we read
a little, dig a little,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.471
read a little, dig a little,

08:26.473 --> 08:28.139
kiss a little,
dig a little.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.641
(groans)

08:29.643 --> 08:31.042
(birds chirping)

08:33.112 --> 08:36.114
Homer, I think you're supposed
to cook sausage.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.349
What's the point?

08:37.351 --> 08:38.650
(knocking on door)

08:38.652 --> 08:40.485
Well, hi there, Homer.

08:40.487 --> 08:43.822
I know a time like this is when
a man really needs his neighbor.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.124
Yeah, well,
thanks for the check-in.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.827
(chuckles) Well, this is
more than a check-in.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.830
It's a chance to do good
for us boys in the hood!

08:51.832 --> 08:53.331
Just call us NWA,

08:53.333 --> 08:56.034
"Neighbors With Appetizers."

08:56.036 --> 08:57.636
(sobbing)

08:57.638 --> 08:59.170
Wow, wow.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.873
I really am
the richest man in town.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.341
Not rich in money,

09:03.343 --> 09:06.344
but in what really matters:
pity.

09:06.346 --> 09:09.714
And what happened to Marge
is a wake up call for us all.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.717
There's no greater crime
than half-assed parenting.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.486
Kirk, where's Milhouse?

09:14.488 --> 09:16.388
On the leash, baby.
On the leash.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.689
He's too far.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.058
Retract.
Retract!

09:20.060 --> 09:22.561
Whoa!
Why'd you pull me back?

09:22.563 --> 09:25.897
Some new kids were just
about to give me a chance.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.699
Don't try anything new, son.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.735
I could've married a woman
who didn't look exactly like me.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.905
(chuckling):
But that would've been crazy.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.340
(door slams shut)

09:35.342 --> 09:37.342
Hey, newbie.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.344
Nobody touches
the new James Patterson

09:39.346 --> 09:42.447
until Solar reads it first.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.419
(moans, yelps)

09:47.421 --> 09:49.521
She wants you
to pick it up.

09:49.523 --> 09:52.190
(laughter)
