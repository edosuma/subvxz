00:53.336 --> 00:58.569
He came back again last night
and tore me like paper.

00:59.542 --> 01:03.376
He opened me like a flower of pain...

01:04.080 --> 01:07.140
...and it felt good.

01:07.884 --> 01:11.650
He sank into me and set me on fire...

01:11.821 --> 01:15.018
...like he always does.

01:15.191 --> 01:19.355
Made me burn from the inside out.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.328
How did you know it was the devil?

01:25.568 --> 01:28.093
I know what you're thinking.

01:28.271 --> 01:32.230
I know you think
I'm talking about my stepfather...

01:32.408 --> 01:34.842
...because you don't believe in the devil.

01:35.111 --> 01:38.478
Okay, let's talk about your stepfather.

01:38.648 --> 01:44.245
You know about my stepfather.
You know I cut his throat.

01:44.554 --> 01:48.388
I cut his Adam's apple in half...

01:48.558 --> 01:52.654
...like a piece of fruit on a summer day...

01:52.829 --> 01:55.730
...so he wouldn't say a word.

01:56.166 --> 02:00.296
I sat next to him
and watched him die...

02:00.470 --> 02:03.667
...slowly.

02:06.476 --> 02:10.207
It was the only way to help him stop.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.473
Stop what?

02:14.083 --> 02:16.711
Stop fucking me!

02:19.856 --> 02:21.585
You're not listening.

02:22.759 --> 02:25.922
I am listening, Chloe.

02:26.095 --> 02:31.260
You're not listening with your heart.
Just your brain.

02:32.702 --> 02:34.602
Your brain is the problem.

02:36.339 --> 02:40.776
You have no idea
how it feels not to be trusted.

02:40.944 --> 02:44.209
You've got to trust me too, Chloe.

02:45.715 --> 02:50.209
You can't trust someone
who thinks you're crazy.

02:54.357 --> 02:58.020
Okay. I think that's enough for today.

02:59.963 --> 03:03.729
But I do think we made
some really good headway...

03:03.900 --> 03:05.731
...found out some new things...

03:05.902 --> 03:09.531
Do you know what it is
to burn from the inside?

03:09.706 --> 03:12.573
- Do you know? Because you are dead!
- Let her go, Chloe.

03:12.742 --> 03:17.270
I am. I'm not touching her!
I'm not touching her! Let me go!

03:17.547 --> 03:19.811
Let me go! Let me go.

03:29.826 --> 03:31.726
Thank you.

03:36.232 --> 03:40.862
You're driving me crazy! Stop!

03:41.037 --> 03:42.561
- Stop it!
- Let go!

03:42.739 --> 03:44.639
Stop it!

03:46.643 --> 03:49.305
I can walk by myself!

03:50.146 --> 03:52.011
Stand up!

03:53.082 --> 03:54.879
Look at that.

03:55.051 --> 03:57.281
"I'm a doctor."

03:57.453 --> 04:01.583
"Open this door."
Hey, you are dead!

04:01.758 --> 04:03.487
Get in.

04:04.727 --> 04:06.251
She's nuts.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.255
Hey.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.986
Sorry.

05:09.158 --> 05:13.390
I need to cross-reference some files
with you on Monday. How's your morning?

05:13.563 --> 05:17.727
- Check with Anna. She'll fit you in.
- Thanks. Sorry.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.697
I'm not discharging her, period.

05:25.875 --> 05:30.471
If you want to pursue this, sir,
have a judge order her transfer.

05:30.646 --> 05:33.206
Until then she's mine.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.384
Thank you.

05:35.551 --> 05:36.813
Lawyers.

05:37.987 --> 05:40.387
Hey, come on in.

05:40.556 --> 05:42.820
What's up?

05:42.992 --> 05:45.426
Chloe. She's embellishing
her rape story again.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.497
She says that the devil
is visiting her in her cell.

05:49.665 --> 05:52.634
- Okay.
- Well, it's the third time in three months.

05:52.802 --> 05:56.101
It has something to do with
her stepfather, possibly remorse...

05:56.272 --> 05:59.298
...but instead of assessing
the memory and accepting it...

05:59.475 --> 06:05.277
...she just falls into these
satanic meanderings.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.473
Time. Give it time.

06:07.650 --> 06:11.984
I've given it time. Time and Elavil.
And Mellaril and Haldol.

06:12.155 --> 06:15.124
Maybe they're just...

06:15.291 --> 06:16.815
...too medicated.

06:17.927 --> 06:21.158
I know we all create our realities
to some extent. Yes, true.

06:21.330 --> 06:25.767
But what she creates
is so far from any objective reality...

06:26.235 --> 06:29.329
Chloe's mind only runs on one track.

06:29.539 --> 06:33.305
Well, right now,
my mind is running on empty.

06:36.245 --> 06:38.475
Come here.

06:43.186 --> 06:47.418
You have a brilliant mind.

06:47.590 --> 06:50.388
You'll figure it out.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.096
Throw it on the mirror.

06:57.967 --> 07:01.733
This is what she sees now.

07:02.371 --> 07:07.104
- A distorted image of herself.
- Who are you in all this?

07:07.910 --> 07:10.344
- I'm the mirror.
- You are the mirror.

07:10.980 --> 07:15.474
If I'm the mirror and she's the image...

07:17.520 --> 07:19.784
...then who are you?

07:19.956 --> 07:22.652
I can see both of you...

07:22.825 --> 07:25.293
...so I'm God.

07:26.229 --> 07:29.062
Or just an overworked hospital bureaucrat.

07:29.232 --> 07:31.530
"God" is good.

07:33.436 --> 07:38.874
Always remember, the ability to repress...

07:39.041 --> 07:44.138
...is actually a vital survival tool.
Without it...

07:44.313 --> 07:47.578
...Chloe might not have survived.

07:55.958 --> 07:59.894
Sorry, am I interrupting
the happy couple?

08:01.364 --> 08:06.768
Dr. Graham. We were just discussing
repression as a survival mechanism.

08:06.936 --> 08:11.373
Oh, yeah, I had a date last week.
I barely survived it. I'm trying to forget it.

08:11.541 --> 08:16.035
I'm sure your amorous adventures
are fascinating, doctor...

08:16.212 --> 08:19.375
...but sadly, I'm on my way out.

08:19.549 --> 08:22.814
- Well, don't let me... I'll just...
- No, no, no, I'm leaving.

08:22.985 --> 08:26.318
I'm gonna run out to Willow Creek.
Meet the new contractor.

08:26.489 --> 08:29.754
I'll be here. See you at dinner.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.828
Keep an eye on my wife for me, Pete.
I know you will. Here.

08:33.996 --> 08:38.592
- No, thanks.
- No, let me circumcise it for you.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.861
Smoke it tonight while it's fresh.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.840
- Good night, boss.
- Good night, kids.

08:51.480 --> 08:55.280
Why don't we share one of those
golden-crust, cheese-filled specials.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.579
- It sounds like a great offer...
- Here's the file.

08:58.754 --> 09:01.086
...but I got work to do.
- I'm buying.

09:01.257 --> 09:03.953
- It's cold when it gets here.
- We could warm it up.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.117
- I hate pizza.
- Who doesn't like pizza?

09:06.295 --> 09:08.263
Come on, you gotta eat.

09:08.431 --> 09:10.490
Not with you.

09:11.267 --> 09:15.897
Come on, we're supposed to celebrate.
I just got circumcised...

09:20.776 --> 09:24.405
- Who's inside?
- We have Shelley for observation.

09:24.580 --> 09:28.038
- Why? What happened?
- She had another attack.

09:28.217 --> 09:32.347
- What'd you do, up her meds?
- Yeah, 25 milligrams.

09:32.521 --> 09:35.718
That's extreme.
That dose is way too high.

09:35.891 --> 09:38.485
I want a copy of that on my desk
by Monday, okay?

09:38.661 --> 09:41.391
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.934
Damn generator.

10:21.437 --> 10:23.462
Not again.

10:25.741 --> 10:27.174
Irene, is that you?

10:28.311 --> 10:30.677
This electric system's
gonna give us trouble.

10:30.846 --> 10:33.337
Fourth time this week.
I'm going for my swim.

10:33.516 --> 10:37.452
Well, I'm gonna do my job,
as long as these damn lights stay on.

11:11.620 --> 11:15.716
- Good night, Joe.
- Hey, how many laps, doc?

11:15.891 --> 11:18.325
Fifty-five, but who's counting?

11:18.494 --> 11:22.430
Oh, you've outdone yourself.
Hey, safe drive home.

11:22.598 --> 11:27.035
- Thank you. Say hi to your wife for me.
- Will do.

11:47.423 --> 11:50.153
All that education
but you can't remember an umbrella.

11:50.326 --> 11:53.853
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah, I got your note. Your business note.

11:54.029 --> 11:57.294
Right. So how was your date with...?

11:57.466 --> 12:03.234
With what's-her-name? It was like all
of my dates. It was brief. It was pointless.

12:03.406 --> 12:06.773
She didn't respond to my
sense of humor, my boyish good looks...

12:06.942 --> 12:08.807
...so I started talking about work.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.414
She said that was not
a suitable topic for a first date...

12:12.581 --> 12:15.982
...and that was it.
I mean, it was just drinks, you know.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.347
I mean, we didn't even have dinner.

12:18.521 --> 12:21.046
She's not right.
When you know, you know.

12:21.223 --> 12:23.191
I know.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.322
- I'll follow you down the hill.
- You don't have to.

12:27.496 --> 12:32.490
- No, I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
- Since when did you ever listen to the boss?

13:19.682 --> 13:23.209
<i>Severe showers all over northern</i>
<i>Connecticut and New Hampshire.</i>

13:23.385 --> 13:26.479
- I know, I see that.
- <i>rain in Lennox County...</i>

13:34.597 --> 13:37.225
- <i>flooding throughout</i>
<i>Lennox County and closure...</i>

13:44.340 --> 13:47.571
- I can't let you through. The road's closed.
- What's going on?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.643
- I got this.
- There's a sinkhole.

13:49.812 --> 13:52.508
- Hi, Bob.
- You picked a hell of a night for a drive.

13:53.349 --> 13:56.546
There's a sinkhole up here,
you can't get through. Sorry.

13:56.719 --> 14:00.155
- What should I do?
- Go a quarter of a mile down, take a left...

14:00.322 --> 14:02.654
You know that bridge
that Doug and I fish at?

14:02.825 --> 14:05.157
- Yeah, the little white one?
- That's the one.

14:05.327 --> 14:06.988
- Yeah.
- You can go across there.

14:07.162 --> 14:09.722
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey, tell Doug to give me a call.

14:09.899 --> 14:11.890
Will do.

14:25.514 --> 14:27.675
- Doug, you're home?
- <i>Yeah, where are you?</i>

14:27.850 --> 14:32.617
I got detoured, so I'll be home in a few
minutes, okay? How was Willow Creek?

14:32.788 --> 14:35.484
<i>This rain is slowing the work down.</i>
<i>It's a big mess.</i>

14:35.658 --> 14:38.252
- Are you okay?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

14:39.728 --> 14:41.593
Doug.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.592
Doug!

15:17.700 --> 15:19.497
Are you okay?

15:20.402 --> 15:22.734
Are you okay?

15:25.474 --> 15:26.736
Hey!

15:38.020 --> 15:42.116
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Okay.

15:42.658 --> 15:47.061
I'm a doctor. I'm gonna take you
to the hospital. I'm a doctor, honey.

15:47.229 --> 15:50.858
I'm gonna help you, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.194
I'm gonna help you, okay?

16:24.767 --> 16:26.792
Help me!

16:26.969 --> 16:29.199
Somebody!

16:36.712 --> 16:38.179
Dr. Graham!

16:38.414 --> 16:41.315
You better tell me why I'm in here, Irene.

16:41.483 --> 16:44.008
She got up wild.

16:44.186 --> 16:48.122
- Bring your ass back in here.
- Give me 40 milligrams of Ativan.

16:48.290 --> 16:50.884
- Get your hands off me.
- Stay in the cell.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.789
- Keep her off.
- Restrain her.

16:52.961 --> 16:57.728
Keep her off of me. Get off of me.
Do you hear me? Get off of me.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.027
Hold on. Calm...

17:00.202 --> 17:03.933
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

17:06.208 --> 17:08.403
Thank you, nurse.

17:10.345 --> 17:12.575
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, she calmed down.

17:12.748 --> 17:15.272
This is so sad.

17:17.986 --> 17:19.886
Miranda, this is very awkward.

17:20.055 --> 17:23.286
I suppose that technically
I shouldn't even be treating you...

17:23.459 --> 17:27.656
...but I managed to get the court to grant us
a waiver until you're transferred.

17:27.829 --> 17:30.298
Anything we discuss
is in strict confidence...

17:30.466 --> 17:32.559
...and won't go anywhere but this room.

17:35.237 --> 17:37.364
How long have I been in here?

17:39.041 --> 17:41.373
Three days.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.611
Why? Why?

17:43.779 --> 17:48.079
You were admitted to our neurosurgical
unit, you were seizing violently.

17:48.751 --> 17:52.209
We did scans and they revealed
left-sided weakness, numbness...

17:52.387 --> 17:54.617
...severe frontal-lobe deficits.

17:54.790 --> 17:57.486
You received Haloperidol, Ativan injections.

17:57.659 --> 18:01.186
When you came out of it, we tested.
You were negative for PCP.

18:01.597 --> 18:06.296
But you were put in restraints for a day
and a half so you wouldn't injure yourself.

18:06.635 --> 18:11.265
And then you basically
went into a state of catatonia.

18:11.907 --> 18:14.740
This is the first time I've seen you lucid.

18:16.578 --> 18:19.445
I wanna talk to my husband.

18:19.615 --> 18:22.550
Where is he? Where is he?

18:22.718 --> 18:26.017
You know, you're the most
logical person I know, bar none.

18:26.555 --> 18:30.150
You rely only on the facts.

18:31.426 --> 18:33.917
So why am I telling you this?

18:34.997 --> 18:38.194
You're establishing my personality.

18:38.367 --> 18:42.463
You think I'm a rational person.
You don't think I'm impulsive or emotional.

18:42.638 --> 18:46.267
And following this pattern of analysis,
we are about to discuss...

18:46.441 --> 18:50.844
...a traumatic event which has rendered
this psychological profile useless.

18:51.013 --> 18:55.211
- You think I'm in denial.
- Don't analyze yourself...

18:55.384 --> 18:58.114
...just focus on remembering.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.417
Miranda...

19:02.591 --> 19:06.584
...what's the last thing you remember?

19:13.836 --> 19:15.827
I remember Chloe.

19:16.371 --> 19:19.829
I was having my Friday night
session with Chloe.

19:20.008 --> 19:21.669
How did that go?

19:24.179 --> 19:27.546
She was embellishing her rape story.

19:28.550 --> 19:30.450
- I saw Doug.
- Dr. Graham.

19:30.886 --> 19:33.081
You were there.

19:35.290 --> 19:40.284
When I went back to my office,
I worked on Chloe's file.

19:40.462 --> 19:45.058
I decided to call it quits, I went down
to the pool, had a swim, 55 laps...

19:45.234 --> 19:49.967
...saw Joe, got my keys.
Went to my car. You walked me to it.

19:50.706 --> 19:53.903
- Yes.
- But...

19:54.076 --> 19:56.408
- There was a detour.
- Oh, hey, tell Doug...

19:56.778 --> 20:00.942
I had to go over the bridge,
so I went over the bridge.

20:08.757 --> 20:12.955
I wonder what else happened.
Try to remember.

20:15.197 --> 20:17.722
I got home.

20:20.903 --> 20:25.237
I saw Doug. He was on the couch.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.145
Try to remember.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.984
There was a girl.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.517
- Yeah, there was a girl.
- No, there was no...

20:46.695 --> 20:49.186
Yeah, there was a girl.

20:49.364 --> 20:51.628
- A girl at the bridge.
- There was no report...

20:51.800 --> 20:54.030
- There was some kind of accident.
- No.

20:54.202 --> 20:57.797
- The girl was bloody. On the bridge...
- I want to ask you about Doug.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.099
What's the last thing you remember?

21:00.275 --> 21:03.733
Why are you asking about Doug?
I'm telling you about a girl I saw.

21:03.912 --> 21:05.971
Was there any trouble in your marriage?

21:06.448 --> 21:09.076
No, there was no trouble in my marriage.

21:09.251 --> 21:12.049
And why are you using
the past tense of the word?

21:12.220 --> 21:13.847
Miranda...

21:14.022 --> 21:18.516
...you don't remember anything
about Doug? Anything at all?

21:18.694 --> 21:20.855
Don't tell me something's
wrong with Doug.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.896
I have to tell you something.
Something very difficult.

21:24.066 --> 21:25.761
No, no, no...

21:26.735 --> 21:30.501
- Don't tell me there's something with Doug.
- Miranda...

21:31.473 --> 21:33.805
...Doug is dead.

21:35.277 --> 21:37.336
You killed him.

21:38.347 --> 21:42.181
- No! No! No!
- Orderly!

21:42.351 --> 21:44.876
I didn't.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.022
- No, I didn't.
- Orderly!

21:48.190 --> 21:51.921
I didn't! I didn't do it! No!

21:54.262 --> 21:57.356
No! No! No, don't do it!

21:57.532 --> 22:01.434
- It's okay.
- I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

22:01.603 --> 22:03.503
I'm on your side.

22:03.672 --> 22:05.867
I'm on your side.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.315
One little bit more.

23:04.433 --> 23:07.095
Rita. Let go.

23:07.436 --> 23:09.836
It's Dr. Grey.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.968
Look it up. Don't look at me like that.

23:24.753 --> 23:27.779
I'm the official champion again.

23:33.195 --> 23:37.291
Hello, Miranda. Welcome.

23:39.734 --> 23:42.134
You're one of us now.

23:43.638 --> 23:46.402
You know I don't belong here, Chloe.

23:46.575 --> 23:49.738
If you're here,
it must mean that you belong.

23:49.911 --> 23:52.505
You are not a doctor in here.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.946
And even if you tell the truth...

23:56.118 --> 23:58.985
...no one will listen.

23:59.154 --> 24:02.351
You know why? Because you're crazy.

24:07.329 --> 24:09.991
And the more you try
to prove them wrong...

24:10.165 --> 24:13.396
...the crazier you appear.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.736
You are invisible now.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.029
Can you feel it?

24:29.484 --> 24:31.349
Don't touch me.

24:32.187 --> 24:33.711
Are you scared?

24:34.222 --> 24:35.849
No.

24:36.024 --> 24:38.151
You should be.

27:01.436 --> 27:03.529
I'm dreaming.

27:04.773 --> 27:06.866
I'm dreaming.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.876
Dream logic, primary process,
that's what this is.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.946
I'm dreaming.

27:13.114 --> 27:17.346
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

27:17.519 --> 27:20.511
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

27:20.689 --> 27:24.420
I'm not crazy. I'm dreaming.

27:27.729 --> 27:31.426
Rise and shine, honey. It's a new day.

27:36.271 --> 27:37.863
I wanna talk to Pete.

27:38.039 --> 27:42.499
You'll see Dr. Graham all in good time,
but now I want you to have some breakfast.

27:44.913 --> 27:49.213
- Why are you doing this to me, Irene?
- I'm just doing my job.

27:49.818 --> 27:53.584
You don't want me to get Jim
to help me, now do you?

28:07.435 --> 28:11.064
Good girl. You're doing good.

28:11.239 --> 28:14.675
Come on, sweetheart,
now it's time for a shower.

28:27.188 --> 28:31.284
Come on, honey,
time to wash away your sins.

29:29.050 --> 29:31.245
<i>You're a nut.</i>

29:34.923 --> 29:37.619
<i>Yeah, it's you. You.</i>

30:02.951 --> 30:05.749
<i>Get away. Get away.</i>

30:12.193 --> 30:13.387
What's your problem?

30:13.595 --> 30:15.995
What's your problem?

30:45.760 --> 30:48.524
I looked away for a second.
It's unacceptable.

30:48.696 --> 30:50.288
It's not your fault.

30:50.465 --> 30:54.925
Patients always find a way to hurt
themselves, if that's what they want.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.197
I never pegged her for a cutter, that's all.

30:58.373 --> 31:00.204
Neither did I.

31:00.375 --> 31:02.900
Shelley says Chloe's
been threatening Miranda...

31:03.077 --> 31:06.205
...so I put her in isolation for the day.

31:06.381 --> 31:07.848
How is she?

31:08.016 --> 31:09.813
She's a mess.

31:09.984 --> 31:14.148
I can't believe she's lost it so quickly.
I've never seen that before.

31:14.322 --> 31:17.621
She cut herself 35 times,
a lot of blood, but it's superficial.

31:17.792 --> 31:20.317
- What was the implement?
- Probably a scalpel...

31:20.495 --> 31:23.396
...though how anybody
got it in there, I have no idea.

31:32.438 --> 31:35.202
Hey, Tony. We're fine.

31:51.357 --> 31:52.619
Come on.

31:52.792 --> 31:56.057
You think I did this
to myself, don't you?

32:00.099 --> 32:01.964
Did you?

32:05.905 --> 32:07.964
No.

32:08.708 --> 32:10.869
Well, I don't know.

32:11.044 --> 32:13.808
Who would it be, then? Would it be...

32:14.247 --> 32:16.647
...Chloe, or...?

32:18.151 --> 32:20.278
I don't know.

32:23.189 --> 32:25.453
By your own admission
you have difficulty...

32:25.625 --> 32:30.927
...distinguishing what's reality
from fantasy, so is it possible?

32:31.097 --> 32:35.227
Yeah, as a doctor,
I understand why you think that.

32:35.401 --> 32:39.633
But something is really happening to me.

32:42.108 --> 32:46.204
What about this moment, right now?

32:48.181 --> 32:50.046
What about it?

32:50.216 --> 32:52.411
Is this a hallucination?

32:54.020 --> 32:55.715
Is it?

33:00.626 --> 33:05.427
I suggest that we simply
increase the medication...

33:05.598 --> 33:07.259
...until things make sense.

33:07.433 --> 33:10.596
Or maybe until I can get myself
a new doctor.

33:10.770 --> 33:12.601
Pardon?

33:12.772 --> 33:16.435
Since I'm hallucinating
and I can't seem to remember things...

33:16.609 --> 33:18.577
...you can help me with something.

33:18.778 --> 33:20.837
Yeah. Inhale.

33:21.447 --> 33:23.847
Did we have an affair?

33:32.525 --> 33:34.288
No.

33:35.394 --> 33:37.521
Did you want to?

33:39.732 --> 33:41.597
Yes.

33:42.468 --> 33:45.232
Did you think I wanted to?

33:46.506 --> 33:48.303
Yes.

33:49.642 --> 33:51.837
Then why didn't we?

33:54.547 --> 33:57.641
Because you were married to the boss.

34:03.222 --> 34:05.554
But I'm not now.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.351
I'm here... I'm...

34:11.330 --> 34:13.764
I'm trying to help you.

34:15.701 --> 34:16.998
Why don't you trust me?

34:18.603 --> 34:23.041
Because you can't trust somebody
when they think you're crazy.

34:50.101 --> 34:51.534
Phil.

34:51.704 --> 34:53.864
Hello, Miranda.

34:54.540 --> 34:56.632
I need to talk to you for a minute.

34:57.143 --> 34:59.475
This is about Pete.

35:04.650 --> 35:06.481
What about him, Miranda?

35:06.652 --> 35:09.780
I don't think he's the best doctor
to be treating me.

35:10.623 --> 35:13.456
Is your complaint about him
on a personal level?

35:15.561 --> 35:19.088
Pete's the best doctor
I have on my staff now.

35:19.265 --> 35:21.699
And he has my full support.

35:22.401 --> 35:24.369
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miranda.

35:51.364 --> 35:53.832
- Miranda.
- Hi, Teddy.

35:59.405 --> 36:02.169
- How are they treating you?
- Like I'm crazy, Teddy.

36:02.341 --> 36:05.708
- They think I did it, but I didn't do it.
- All right. Thank you.

36:05.878 --> 36:09.370
- I didn't do it, Teddy.
- Have a seat.

36:11.617 --> 36:13.448
Let's not...

36:13.619 --> 36:16.884
Let's not talk about what you did
or didn't do, all right?

36:17.056 --> 36:20.822
What's important is what
I can do for you now.

36:20.993 --> 36:26.795
Now, the DA is pushing for a hearing
as early as next week.

36:26.966 --> 36:31.630
Next week? We haven't even
had time to investigate.

36:31.804 --> 36:33.601
We can't have a hearing next week.

36:33.773 --> 36:38.972
As your attorney, I gotta tell you
the evidence is overwhelming.

36:39.145 --> 36:42.842
You've been placed at the scene.
The sheriff saw you driving home.

36:43.015 --> 36:44.812
The neighbors heard the screams.

36:44.984 --> 36:47.851
They've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.511
Your prints are on the floor,
walls, everything.

36:50.690 --> 36:53.682
Yeah, but what's my motive?
I don't have a motive, Teddy.

36:53.859 --> 36:58.159
Why would I do that?
Maybe one of his ex-patients came.

36:58.331 --> 37:01.027
Has anybody checked the files?
Has anybody escaped?

37:01.200 --> 37:04.658
That person would have a motive.
I was there, and I would scream.

37:04.837 --> 37:07.965
- Maybe I went into shock.
- Miranda.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.132
The only shot we have
is to plead temporary insanity.

37:11.911 --> 37:16.007
And I don't even know if that's gonna work.
You're a brilliant psychiatrist.

37:16.182 --> 37:19.515
That will make jurors think
"If she wanted to kill somebody...

37:19.685 --> 37:23.177
...she could probably fake insanity
and get away with it."

37:23.356 --> 37:24.687
I'm not crazy.

37:24.857 --> 37:27.189
- That's the point.
- No, the point is...

37:27.360 --> 37:32.195
...I'm the only one around here
that believes I didn't kill my husband!

37:38.404 --> 37:40.497
Do you think I'm crazy?

37:44.176 --> 37:46.303
That's all right. Forget it.

37:46.479 --> 37:48.709
Forget it.

37:56.956 --> 37:59.390
Sheriff Ryan is here.

37:59.558 --> 38:01.617
He'd like to talk to you.

38:01.794 --> 38:06.731
You know he was Doug's best friend,
so I'd advise against it.

38:08.367 --> 38:12.360
It's fine, Teddy.
I don't have anything to hide.

38:31.524 --> 38:33.458
<i>Five minutes.</i>

38:38.230 --> 38:39.697
Hi, Bob.

38:40.699 --> 38:42.690
Miranda.

38:44.437 --> 38:49.306
I just have a few questions
that we need to clear up.

38:49.842 --> 38:54.176
When you first came in
and he was sitting on the couch...

38:54.480 --> 39:00.043
...the way we reconstruct the crime is that
the first blow came from in front of him.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.746
Which means he must have seen it coming.

39:04.356 --> 39:07.792
And what we don't understand is how he...

39:09.395 --> 39:11.056
- Why did you do it?
- Sheriff.

39:11.230 --> 39:13.858
How could you kill Doug like that?
He loved you.

39:14.033 --> 39:19.027
- That's the only question I need answered.
- You don't have to answer any questions.

39:19.205 --> 39:22.072
I don't have any answers
to the questions, Bob.

39:22.241 --> 39:26.905
You don't? You better start thinking of some
answers, because you're in some trouble.

39:27.079 --> 39:29.775
- Sheriff, that's enough. That's enough!
- No, no, no.

39:29.949 --> 39:32.383
I need her to tell me why she did it.

39:32.551 --> 39:34.746
Okay, we're done. Enough!

39:34.920 --> 39:37.081
Let's kill your friend, see how you feel!

39:37.256 --> 39:40.748
- You said no shock treatment.
- Here's some shock treatment!

39:40.926 --> 39:43.986
- Stop it. Why would you take these out?
- Don't look.

39:44.163 --> 39:45.460
Don't look at them.

39:45.631 --> 39:49.931
I had to pick him up off the floor, Miranda.
In pieces!

39:57.743 --> 40:00.075
Miranda, what's that?

40:27.373 --> 40:29.864
It's okay. It's okay, Miranda.

40:30.176 --> 40:33.771
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Miranda, let's just go. We're done.

40:33.946 --> 40:36.244
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.

40:36.415 --> 40:39.350
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.

40:39.518 --> 40:44.820
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?!

42:51.417 --> 42:53.647
Come in, Miranda.

42:56.055 --> 42:58.114
Please, take a seat.

43:04.563 --> 43:05.996
So...

43:06.398 --> 43:08.525
You wanted to see me.

43:10.869 --> 43:13.463
I was there.

43:16.442 --> 43:19.104
I was there when Doug was killed.

43:21.814 --> 43:25.215
But I wasn't alone.

43:25.517 --> 43:28.816
I wasn't there alone,
and that's what "not alone" means.

43:29.321 --> 43:31.983
- Who was there with you?
- I don't know who it was.

43:32.157 --> 43:35.024
I don't know. I don't know who it was.

43:35.194 --> 43:37.059
But somebody else was there.

43:40.199 --> 43:42.224
Miranda.

43:43.001 --> 43:45.663
We know you have no family left.

43:46.004 --> 43:48.302
We are your family now.

43:48.474 --> 43:52.171
I know. I know you...
I know.

43:53.645 --> 43:57.741
I want you to know that we're gonna
do everything we possibly can...

43:57.916 --> 44:01.716
...to help you and to make you feel secure.

44:01.887 --> 44:06.722
And to make you feel
that you can trust us here.

44:08.894 --> 44:11.727
But there's a hearing scheduled.

44:11.897 --> 44:15.025
- Miranda. Sit down.
- Just... Come on, sit down.

44:15.834 --> 44:17.802
Miranda.

44:31.216 --> 44:33.241
Who is this girl?

44:33.419 --> 44:36.217
- Put the picture back.
- Who is this girl?

44:37.289 --> 44:39.120
That's my daughter, Rachel.

44:40.692 --> 44:45.527
No, this is the girl I saw at the bridge.
This is the girl.

44:45.697 --> 44:47.722
- No.
- How is she? Where is she?

44:47.900 --> 44:50.960
- It's impossible.
- This is the girl I've been seeing.

44:51.136 --> 44:53.104
This girl, right here.

44:54.139 --> 44:55.868
She's dead.

44:59.111 --> 45:01.602
Rachel died four years ago.

46:09.715 --> 46:12.377
I'm a rational person.

46:12.951 --> 46:15.511
I believe in science.

46:16.788 --> 46:19.757
I don't believe in the paranormal.

46:20.359 --> 46:24.989
And I don't believe in ghosts.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.404
But if you are the ghost of Rachel Parsons...

46:34.907 --> 46:37.876
...then you would let me out of this cell.

47:48.747 --> 47:51.614
Bob, you leave this?

48:08.500 --> 48:10.491
Shit. Pete's office.

49:05.057 --> 49:06.854
Chloe.

50:03.014 --> 50:04.845
Chloe!

50:15.193 --> 50:17.286
Help me!

50:21.700 --> 50:24.760
Let me go! Let me go!

50:24.936 --> 50:28.372
Check Chloe! Check Chloe!
She needs help!

50:49.394 --> 50:53.091
- Did you talk to Chloe?
- Yes.

50:54.065 --> 50:57.466
- Was she raped?
- Was she raped? No.

50:57.636 --> 51:00.469
- Why?
- Did you check her?

51:00.639 --> 51:03.938
Did I...? She was checked.
Of course she was checked.

51:04.109 --> 51:06.509
- He didn't have time.
- He?

51:06.678 --> 51:11.809
- What about her face? She had a cut.
- She ran into a wall. She did that to herself.

51:13.685 --> 51:17.280
I saw a tattoo. Did she talk about a tattoo?

51:17.455 --> 51:20.618
- Why don't you sit down. A tattoo?
- Yeah, a tattoo.

51:20.792 --> 51:26.094
A woman in flames, hands up like this:

51:26.264 --> 51:28.255
Like a Biblical image.

51:29.267 --> 51:30.700
The Anima Sola?

51:32.237 --> 51:37.072
- Yeah, the Anima Sola. That's what I saw.
- It's a common archetypal image.

51:37.242 --> 51:39.972
I mean, it's the woman in chains,
awaiting her fate.

51:40.145 --> 51:45.208
I'm talking about something I saw
on the chest of a man.

51:46.218 --> 51:48.584
- That's what I saw.
- You're in crisis.

51:48.753 --> 51:51.483
This image is tailor-made
for your state of mind.

51:51.957 --> 51:55.051
A woman in purgatory.

51:57.629 --> 51:59.893
I need you to explain this to me, though.

52:03.268 --> 52:08.570
- Rachel Parsons did not commit suicide.
- She jumped off a bridge.

52:08.740 --> 52:11.903
- When I saw her...
- She was washed downstream five miles.

52:12.077 --> 52:14.637
- She was cut up.
- You saw her?

52:14.813 --> 52:19.182
- Yes, I saw her. Someone did that to her!
- Police, newspapers, coroner are wrong?

52:19.351 --> 52:21.581
- Let's reopen the case.
- Maybe they should!

52:21.753 --> 52:25.314
- I saw her. And she's connected to me.
- Delusions, hallucinations...

52:25.490 --> 52:28.516
- How, I don't know.
...disorganized speech, incoherence...

52:28.693 --> 52:33.756
Don't rattle off your psychiatric shit!
I know it like the back of my hand!

52:33.932 --> 52:35.627
Good.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.961
Saves me the trouble.

52:39.237 --> 52:41.501
Glass cells are having electrical problems.

52:41.673 --> 52:44.164
I'm gonna transfer you to a Psych Ward cell.

52:44.442 --> 52:47.502
One strike, you're going to solitary.

52:48.046 --> 52:49.911
Don't screw up.

52:51.583 --> 52:54.746
Rachel Parsons was there.

52:54.920 --> 52:58.014
Dead or alive, I don't know.

52:59.524 --> 53:02.891
That girl came to me.

53:04.229 --> 53:06.857
She came to me.

53:47.339 --> 53:49.364
Hi, Chloe.

53:52.877 --> 53:54.538
I'm sorry.

54:02.454 --> 54:04.183
I'm sorry.

54:04.889 --> 54:07.483
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

54:08.393 --> 54:12.193
I need you to tell me who did this to you.

54:13.631 --> 54:15.758
Tell me his name, Chloe.

54:15.934 --> 54:19.426
Chloe, tell me.
Tell me anything. Tell me.

54:20.939 --> 54:22.770
I'll tell you one thing:

54:23.441 --> 54:25.602
He can have my body...

54:26.144 --> 54:28.977
...but he will never have my soul.

54:29.147 --> 54:30.478
Never.

54:33.251 --> 54:35.048
The devil.

55:01.513 --> 55:03.481
It's okay.

55:04.783 --> 55:06.808
It's okay.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.915
He said you're next.

55:25.937 --> 55:29.338
- Try to stay awake.
- Yes, ma'am.

55:29.574 --> 55:33.442
If you need me, I'll be in the coffee room.

55:46.591 --> 55:48.718
Lights out.

57:17.949 --> 57:19.883
Leave me alone!

57:26.424 --> 57:30.019
- Doesn't even look like a real ant.
- It's got disco balls for eyes.

57:30.528 --> 57:33.122
- '50s B movies, man.
- Giant bug movies are great.

57:33.298 --> 57:35.163
Hey, what is that?

57:41.839 --> 57:44.774
It's Dr. Grey.
She's trying to kill herself.

57:46.077 --> 57:49.478
Level C, we've got suicidal behavior
in cell 33. Sending backup.

57:55.486 --> 57:57.181
Open it!

58:00.391 --> 58:02.825
Dr. Grey's in trouble!

58:06.664 --> 58:09.565
Number 33, open it now!

58:13.371 --> 58:16.602
Oh, damn.
Damn, what a mess.

58:16.774 --> 58:20.403
- Hold her, I'll medicate her.
- What the hell for? She's already out.

58:20.578 --> 58:22.944
Don't argue with me.

58:23.181 --> 58:26.582
Jesus! Easy, easy.
No, don't hurt me.

58:27.452 --> 58:30.080
Stop her! She's got my keys, stop her!

58:30.388 --> 58:31.878
Shit!

58:40.698 --> 58:42.461
Hey! Hey!

58:42.634 --> 58:43.896
Wait! Hey!

58:44.068 --> 58:46.935
We got a runner! Inmate escaping!
Block Three!

58:54.345 --> 58:56.813
- Stay with me.
- All right.

58:58.716 --> 59:01.207
She's gone this way. Let's go!

59:03.221 --> 59:05.121
Clear!

59:20.305 --> 59:21.738
Split up! Keep moving!

59:27.679 --> 59:30.204
She's going up the North Tower!

59:44.495 --> 59:46.360
Shit!

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:08.313
Shit!

01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:13.617
Hey! It's already open!

01:00:21.165 --> 01:00:22.530
She's on the upper level!

01:00:23.835 --> 01:00:25.962
Hold it right there!

01:00:26.137 --> 01:00:29.004
- Dr. Grey!
- We're on Three, she's heading for One!

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:32.335
Go! Go!

01:00:35.646 --> 01:00:37.580
Go the other way!

01:00:48.693 --> 01:00:50.422
Circle back.

01:01:18.055 --> 01:01:19.682
Come on, Hank.

01:01:24.228 --> 01:01:26.696
Don't think she made it
to this building anyway.

01:01:30.368 --> 01:01:33.895
Yeah, but even so,
there's no way she can get out.

01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:37.438
Hide-and-seek. The longer it lasts,
the more overtime we make.

01:02:09.607 --> 01:02:14.010
- You should be a professor.
- Professors always nail the pretty students.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.620
Let's go. I don't think she's in here.

01:02:38.536 --> 01:02:40.060
I got it.

01:02:41.806 --> 01:02:43.364
Is it clear there?

01:02:46.911 --> 01:02:49.539
We checked corridors Four and Five.

01:02:49.714 --> 01:02:53.878
- It's cool. We're headed to Six and Seven.
- Yeah. It's Joe, up at the desk.

01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:57.077
- What's going on down there?
- Looks dark down there.

01:02:57.255 --> 01:02:59.314
What do you mean, what do I mean?

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:03.620
Look, this is the fourth time this month
this has happened. Never mind.

01:03:03.794 --> 01:03:07.321
- Ye... Thank you.
- Finally.

01:03:07.932 --> 01:03:09.365
- Took long enough.
- Shit.

01:03:10.301 --> 01:03:11.928
Hey, Joe.

01:03:13.804 --> 01:03:15.897
You see something?

01:03:16.073 --> 01:03:19.065
Yeah, just now when the monitors came on.

01:03:19.243 --> 01:03:22.974
Corridor Six, something flashed
in front of the camera.

01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:26.344
Frank, East Wing. Don, take the West.
I'll take the stairs.

01:03:31.556 --> 01:03:32.921
Here, take my car.

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:34.682
Go. Go.

01:03:35.326 --> 01:03:37.226
Go on.

01:05:07.685 --> 01:05:10.654
What do you want from me?!

01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:10.972
Okay. Now what?

01:07:45.776 --> 01:07:47.175
Miranda, no!

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:55.142
Doug?

01:08:15.639 --> 01:08:18.836
No. No, Miranda, no.

01:08:21.578 --> 01:08:24.548
Miranda, don't! No, don't, please!

01:08:24.715 --> 01:08:27.513
Please! No! Miranda, no!
No, please!

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:31.621
Please! Don't do this to me! No!

01:08:31.788 --> 01:08:34.279
Don't! No! Miranda, no, wait!

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:36.448
Don't do this to me, please, Miranda!

01:08:36.627 --> 01:08:39.288
Miranda, no! Don't! No!

01:08:40.331 --> 01:08:43.323
Don't do this to me, Miranda!
Miranda, please!

01:08:43.934 --> 01:08:45.196
I love you.

01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:46.993
What did I do?

01:10:41.185 --> 01:10:42.914
Why?

01:10:43.153 --> 01:10:44.984
Why?

01:10:49.693 --> 01:10:51.661
Why me?

01:10:54.465 --> 01:10:57.263
Why? Why?

01:11:11.515 --> 01:11:13.176
Willow Creek.

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:14.612
<i>How was Willow Creek?</i>

01:11:14.952 --> 01:11:18.513
<i>This rain is slowing the work down.</i>
<i>It's a big damn mess.</i>

01:16:45.215 --> 01:16:47.775
<i>I'll see you in a couple of days.</i>

01:16:58.795 --> 01:17:00.626
<i>It's good to be God.</i>

01:17:01.598 --> 01:17:02.860
<i>I love you.</i>

01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:30.085
- Drop the knife!
- Drop the gun!

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.659
Put it on the ground now!

01:17:31.828 --> 01:17:33.420
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the knife!

01:17:33.597 --> 01:17:36.088
- You drop it!
- Holy Christ.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.799
What?

01:17:42.939 --> 01:17:44.270
Help me, please!

01:17:44.741 --> 01:17:46.231
Help!

01:17:46.643 --> 01:17:48.668
Carter, get down here now!

01:17:48.845 --> 01:17:50.710
Help me, please!

01:17:50.881 --> 01:17:52.781
Please!

01:17:53.784 --> 01:17:57.777
All I can tell you is that the girl
has been identified as Tracy Seavers.

01:17:57.954 --> 01:18:00.252
She was reported missing two weeks ago.

01:18:00.424 --> 01:18:03.689
She was found this morning
by two patrolmen in Willow Creek...

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.557
...at a farm belonging to Dr. Douglas Grey.
She is now hospitalized.

01:18:07.731 --> 01:18:09.858
Can she speak?
Has she told you anything?

01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:12.433
- We can't comment on that.
- Are there others?

01:18:12.602 --> 01:18:14.365
We can't confirm that. Excuse me.

01:18:14.538 --> 01:18:17.302
Sheriff, is the FBI taking over
this investigation?

01:18:17.474 --> 01:18:19.305
Why don't you ask the goddamn FBI?

01:18:19.476 --> 01:18:21.706
We need her at the hospital
for medication.

01:18:21.878 --> 01:18:25.109
Consider house arrest pending trial,
given the circumstances.

01:18:25.282 --> 01:18:27.910
Last night, your client dropped a guard...

01:18:28.084 --> 01:18:31.417
...assaulted a nurse, escaped from
an institution, stole a car...

01:18:31.588 --> 01:18:33.681
And saved a girl's life.

01:18:34.157 --> 01:18:36.591
- How did she know she was there?
- I don't know.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.594
- But the point is...
- The woman is still a murder suspect!

01:18:41.131 --> 01:18:42.530
Come here.

01:18:47.137 --> 01:18:50.106
The FBI says there could be more victims.

01:18:50.273 --> 01:18:52.935
There were needles down there,
a video camera.

01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:56.101
Once the press gets ahold of it,
it'll get big and ugly.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:59.378
Now, I need some answers,
and I'm running out of time.

01:18:59.549 --> 01:19:02.882
So your client isn't going anywhere
until my team...

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.651
I need to talk to her.

01:19:24.074 --> 01:19:27.771
It's hard to believe
Doug did something like this.

01:19:29.246 --> 01:19:32.647
We worked together a long time.
I thought I knew him pretty well.

01:19:37.053 --> 01:19:38.987
How could I be so blind?

01:19:42.225 --> 01:19:44.819
Well, you weren't the only one, Phil.

01:19:48.932 --> 01:19:52.698
Do you think my daughter could
also have been a victim of Doug's?

01:19:53.503 --> 01:19:55.027
Yes.

01:19:55.639 --> 01:19:58.039
That's what "not alone" means.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:03.168
Rachel was trying to tell me that
she was not Doug's only victim.

01:20:04.414 --> 01:20:06.644
And all this time...

01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:12.088
...we thought our baby
had committed suicide.

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:14.980
You see...

01:20:15.158 --> 01:20:17.592
...even after she was gone...

01:20:20.597 --> 01:20:21.859
Well...

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.592
What?

01:20:25.769 --> 01:20:28.101
I had this recurring dream about her.

01:20:28.638 --> 01:20:31.766
Eventually I took medication
to block it out.

01:20:31.942 --> 01:20:33.409
What kind of dream?

01:20:33.577 --> 01:20:38.139
She was burning in flames,
in terrible pain.

01:20:38.515 --> 01:20:40.642
I couldn't save her.

01:20:41.451 --> 01:20:45.683
I saw her exactly the same way,
burning in flames.

01:20:46.056 --> 01:20:47.853
What does that mean?

01:20:49.492 --> 01:20:51.960
Miranda, I... I...

01:20:52.963 --> 01:20:55.295
I wouldn't look for
a real-world explanation.

01:20:55.932 --> 01:20:59.231
It's a dream, a delusion.

01:20:59.402 --> 01:21:02.963
A delusion that we both seem to share.

01:21:13.316 --> 01:21:14.749
- Yeah.
- Pete.

01:21:14.918 --> 01:21:16.545
I was just talking to Parsons.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.950
I've been wrong about
everything until now.

01:21:19.122 --> 01:21:22.091
It's finally clear to me.
The image is finally clear.

01:21:22.258 --> 01:21:25.386
The man raping women in prison
is connected to the murders.

01:21:25.562 --> 01:21:27.553
It goes back to the Anima Sola tattoo.

01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:30.962
Miranda, you have to stop doing this.
Do you understand me?

01:21:31.267 --> 01:21:35.795
<i>Every time people start taking you seriously,</i>
<i>you start talking about delusions again.</i>

01:21:35.972 --> 01:21:38.566
I'm not deluded, Pete, I'm possessed.

01:21:39.376 --> 01:21:42.038
I don't believe in ghosts.

01:21:42.512 --> 01:21:45.675
Neither do I, but they believe in me.

01:21:45.849 --> 01:21:48.147
<i>Great, just great.</i>

01:22:01.031 --> 01:22:03.056
Let's go. Come on.

01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:11.206
I need to talk to Sheriff Ryan.

01:22:11.374 --> 01:22:14.343
He's working with the FBI team.
He won't be back tonight.

01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:16.536
It's really important.

01:22:16.713 --> 01:22:18.681
I'll leave him a message.

01:22:20.717 --> 01:22:22.275
Thank you.

01:22:40.303 --> 01:22:41.895
Screw it.

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.104
I got a message you wanted to talk to me?

01:23:20.543 --> 01:23:23.376
Yeah, Bob.

01:23:23.546 --> 01:23:27.448
I wanna talk to you.
Maybe this time you can actually hear me.

01:23:27.684 --> 01:23:32.178
Because the last time, all you wanted to do
was scream and yell and accuse me...

01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:36.689
- Is this what you wanna talk to me about?
- No. I wanna talk about the facts.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.953
They're a little different now, right?

01:23:40.764 --> 01:23:45.258
Do you have any idea what happens to a
small-town sheriff when the FBI takes over?

01:23:45.435 --> 01:23:48.632
- If you know anything, anything...
- Not alone.

01:23:49.139 --> 01:23:50.401
What?

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.207
Not alone.

01:23:52.509 --> 01:23:54.602
I know what it means.

01:23:55.178 --> 01:23:57.442
There are two killers.

01:23:58.481 --> 01:24:01.712
Parsons and I both saw a girl
burning in flames.

01:24:01.885 --> 01:24:06.413
Then I saw Chloe being raped by a man
with an Anima Sola tattoo on his body.

01:24:06.589 --> 01:24:10.491
A woman burning in flames. Get it?

01:24:10.894 --> 01:24:15.194
Okay, it's crazy. I know it sounds crazy.
Pete has told me it's crazy.

01:24:15.365 --> 01:24:17.959
- You told Pete? When?
- Yes.

01:24:18.134 --> 01:24:19.658
Yes.

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:22.331
This afternoon. Why?

01:24:24.674 --> 01:24:28.974
I don't think you're crazy at all.
And I don't know why he would dismiss it.

01:24:29.145 --> 01:24:33.946
- You actually saw this tattoo?
- Yes, I saw it. On a man.

01:24:34.117 --> 01:24:36.585
I've heard of serial killers
who hunt together.

01:24:36.753 --> 01:24:38.778
Classic mentor and disciple syndrome.

01:24:38.955 --> 01:24:42.186
So we're looking for the disciple?
Who could it be?

01:24:42.358 --> 01:24:44.588
- I don't know.
- You're a psychiatrist.

01:24:44.761 --> 01:24:47.025
What kind of guy would this have to be?

01:24:47.931 --> 01:24:49.489
Okay.

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:55.967
He would have to be someone
who grew up in a household...

01:24:56.139 --> 01:24:58.334
...that had an absent father.

01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:00.600
He developed...

01:25:00.777 --> 01:25:04.076
...an obsessive, over-dependent
relationship with his mother...

01:25:04.247 --> 01:25:08.206
...which then turned into some
inappropriate sexual attraction.

01:25:08.551 --> 01:25:12.954
He probably even got off
torturing little animals as a kid.

01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:19.419
And as a man he is totally confused
about his sexuality.

01:25:19.596 --> 01:25:21.564
That's who he is.

01:25:23.132 --> 01:25:26.329
Man, that's screwed up.

01:25:27.437 --> 01:25:30.838
But a guy like that could seem
smart and normal, right?

01:25:31.007 --> 01:25:32.838
Yeah, they usually do. Yeah.

01:25:33.009 --> 01:25:35.603
Look, Miranda, I don't wanna scare you...

01:25:36.045 --> 01:25:41.574
...but if there is a second killer out there,
he is frantically trying to cover his trail.

01:25:41.751 --> 01:25:45.209
You're a big threat to this guy.
Who knows how much more you know?

01:25:45.388 --> 01:25:46.855
I don't know anything else.

01:25:47.223 --> 01:25:49.657
You saw the tattoo,
found the girl at the barn.

01:25:49.826 --> 01:25:51.885
Yeah, but I found all that by instinct.

01:25:52.061 --> 01:25:54.586
This guy is facing the electric chair.

01:25:55.064 --> 01:25:58.295
He doesn't have the luxury
of believing in instinct or ghosts.

01:25:58.468 --> 01:26:02.268
He's gotta believe that Doug
confessed to you what he was doing.

01:26:03.339 --> 01:26:04.897
But he didn't confess.

01:26:05.308 --> 01:26:07.970
Maybe he didn't spill it out loud, but...

01:26:08.945 --> 01:26:12.073
Well, you know, you're a psychiatrist.

01:26:12.415 --> 01:26:15.009
There's a lot of ways to confess.

01:26:16.019 --> 01:26:19.921
I'm just trying to put myself
in this guy's place.

01:26:23.293 --> 01:26:26.160
Then why didn't he go back
to Willow Creek?

01:26:26.663 --> 01:26:30.224
- Take care of the girl, clean up evidence?
- Yeah.

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.001
Well, that's how you get caught.
You panic.

01:26:35.071 --> 01:26:37.596
Better to let the dust settle.

01:26:38.508 --> 01:26:40.373
But about you...

01:26:40.777 --> 01:26:43.075
...he's desperate.
- Yeah?

01:26:43.579 --> 01:26:45.638
Desperate enough to...

01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:47.505
...talk to me?

01:26:51.754 --> 01:26:53.551
Well, you're right.

01:26:53.756 --> 01:26:55.986
I do fit the profile.

01:26:56.259 --> 01:27:00.059
Longtime friend of Doug's,
access to the prison.

01:27:01.698 --> 01:27:04.633
I never did get a kick out of
torturing animals, though.

01:27:08.271 --> 01:27:09.761
Stop it!

01:27:11.374 --> 01:27:12.898
- No!
- Yes!

01:27:15.645 --> 01:27:18.239
- You can't kill me!
- I'm not gonna kill you.

01:27:18.414 --> 01:27:22.714
After this kicks in, I'm gonna have a lot
more fun with you than Doug ever did.

01:27:22.885 --> 01:27:24.375
Help!

01:27:35.598 --> 01:27:37.589
Miranda!

01:27:41.537 --> 01:27:42.868
Damn it!

01:27:44.574 --> 01:27:46.542
Help me! Help!

01:27:49.278 --> 01:27:51.109
Help me!

01:28:16.072 --> 01:28:18.040
Okay.

01:28:20.276 --> 01:28:22.904
You tried to escape, Miranda.

01:28:24.013 --> 01:28:28.712
That means I can do
whatever I want to you.

01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:35.316
Rachel wasn't the first, you know.

01:28:36.325 --> 01:28:40.557
Doug killed a girl when he was
15 years old!

01:28:42.265 --> 01:28:44.597
I helped him bury the body.

01:28:49.839 --> 01:28:51.397
What are best friends for?

01:28:54.477 --> 01:28:56.945
We got older. But I gotta tell you...

01:28:57.113 --> 01:29:00.378
...you never lose your taste
for the young girls.

01:29:00.783 --> 01:29:04.014
Then we stopped for a long time.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.814
But then Dougie saw sweet Rachel and...

01:29:09.725 --> 01:29:13.058
That was an itch way too deep
not to scratch.

01:29:14.964 --> 01:29:19.025
And then we had the time of our lives
out at Willow Creek.

01:29:19.802 --> 01:29:21.895
Everything was perfect.

01:29:22.071 --> 01:29:24.767
Those girls would do anything.

01:29:25.007 --> 01:29:26.872
We were their god.

01:29:27.577 --> 01:29:29.442
Until you...

01:29:30.746 --> 01:29:32.737
Miranda!

01:29:38.788 --> 01:29:42.053
You and I both know
you're not getting out of here.

01:29:42.225 --> 01:29:44.489
So let's be logical...

01:29:44.727 --> 01:29:47.355
...and end this thing.

01:29:56.606 --> 01:29:59.541
Thank you, Miranda.

01:30:08.918 --> 01:30:10.545
Rachel?

01:30:15.458 --> 01:30:17.449
This isn't logical.

01:30:17.627 --> 01:30:19.527
You're already dead!

01:30:45.888 --> 01:30:48.379
Logic is overrated.

01:31:29.565 --> 01:31:31.590
I'm sorry, Miranda.

01:31:43.446 --> 01:31:48.509
So it's been almost a year
and I still have bad dreams.

01:31:49.151 --> 01:31:51.551
Sometimes I wake up screaming.

01:31:51.821 --> 01:31:53.345
That's normal.

01:31:53.522 --> 01:31:56.116
No, not these dreams.

01:31:57.026 --> 01:31:59.790
Everyone thought you and I were crazy...

01:32:00.096 --> 01:32:02.064
...but we were seeing the truth.

01:32:02.231 --> 01:32:04.222
More than they could see.

01:32:05.268 --> 01:32:08.431
Once you open the door,
you can never close it.

01:32:08.604 --> 01:32:11.334
Not true. I closed it.

01:32:11.507 --> 01:32:13.338
Then I locked it...

01:32:13.509 --> 01:32:15.272
...and then I threw away the key.

01:32:15.444 --> 01:32:17.878
I really hope that's true.

01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:21.614
You know, my train leaves in half an hour.

01:32:21.884 --> 01:32:24.751
Okay. I'll get you on your way.

01:32:27.857 --> 01:32:31.793
So good luck with your job, okay?

01:32:33.863 --> 01:32:36.923
I wanted to thank you for what you did.

01:32:38.434 --> 01:32:40.129
You really helped me.

01:32:40.303 --> 01:32:42.294
You helped me.

01:32:42.505 --> 01:32:44.803
You taught me how to listen.

01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:46.766
Thank you.

01:32:48.544 --> 01:32:50.341
We made it.

01:33:41.564 --> 01:33:43.122
No!
