I can't!
Makoa, come on!

00:28.408 --> 00:29.940

I think I broke it.

It's my ankle.

Aw, man.

00:39.452 --> 00:40.551
Hey, this is Tua.

00:40.553 --> 00:42.953
We got a first aid situation in
sector four.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.054
Need assistance ASAP.
Over.

00:44.056 --> 00:45.523
MAN:
Roger that.

00:45.525 --> 00:47.458
I can probably walk on it.
Come on, I'll help you up.

Keep the weight off until
we can get you checked out.

00:48.761 --> 00:50.327
Here, here, give me
your hand, man. Easy, now.

Wow, you guys really

More like a klick.

02:03.536 --> 02:04.668
A klick?

02:04.670 --> 02:06.136
Yeah, a kilometer.
6.2 of a mile.

I don't even know how long.

02:14.013 --> 02:15.579

Statement of the obvious.

Oh, it's a statement. All right,
well, how about-how about

02:17.183 --> 02:18.349
this statement of the obvious,

02:18.351 --> 02:21.018
okay?
There is a direct correlation

02:21.020 --> 02:22.186
between how far you walk

02:22.188 --> 02:24.455
to a crime scene
and how bad that crime scene

02:24.457 --> 02:25.723
is gonna be when you get there,

02:25.725 --> 02:28.392
okay? This is looking already
like a two, three-day case.

02:28.394 --> 02:30.427
Just-just from this ridiculous walk.
So what?

02:30.429 --> 02:31.462
What's the problem with that?

02:31.464 --> 02:32.496
Tomorrow's Halloween.

02:32.498 --> 02:33.898
Halloween, you know?

02:33.900 --> 02:35.466
It's the thing with the kids
and they get the candy

02:35.467 --> 02:36.470
and they're happy and they wear
the costumes. Trick or tre...

02:36.494 --> 02:37.569
Y... I love Halloween.

02:37.570 --> 02:40.004
I'm very familiar with Halloween.
You are? Because

02:40.006 --> 02:41.539
your Halloween is the same thing
every year.

02:41.541 --> 02:43.440
You sit on a couch and you eat
popcorn and you watch the same

02:43.442 --> 02:44.875
stupid movie, okay?
That's right, it's fantastic.

02:44.877 --> 02:46.043
Well, for me,
it's different.

02:46.045 --> 02:47.311
You see,
time does not stand still.

02:47.313 --> 02:49.713
When you have kids,
it is only a matter of time

02:49.715 --> 02:51.682
before they'd rather
eat a-a tree

02:51.684 --> 02:53.083
than spend Halloween with you.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.485
Gracie made other plans?

02:54.487 --> 02:57.388
She, uh, is lost to me, as far
as Halloween is concerned.

02:57.390 --> 02:58.756
But the little guy,

02:58.758 --> 03:01.025
he's very excited.
We have big plans, and now this.

03:01.027 --> 03:02.026
You have plans with Charlie?

03:02.028 --> 03:03.427
Yeah.
Oh, buddy. Well, listen,

03:03.429 --> 03:05.095
your son'll understand
if you can't make it.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.397
No, no.
Four-year-olds do not

03:06.399 --> 03:08.065
understand why their father
is not present,

03:08.067 --> 03:09.400
they just know that he is not.

03:09.402 --> 03:11.902
All right, look, this
might not be that bad.

03:13.205 --> 03:16.240
Kono. Call said
we got body parts.

03:16.242 --> 03:17.841
Yeah. A lot of them.

03:17.843 --> 03:20.044
Found by a couple of kids
on a horror campout.

03:20.046 --> 03:21.445
A what?

03:21.447 --> 03:23.180
It's an interactive adventure.

03:23.182 --> 03:25.149
People pay good money
to spend the night outdoors

03:25.151 --> 03:26.584
while a bunch of actors in masks

03:26.586 --> 03:28.519
scare the hell out of them
chasing them around.

03:28.521 --> 03:30.955
Uh-huh.

03:30.957 --> 03:32.790
I know a couple streets
in Camden where you get

03:32.792 --> 03:34.325

free of charge.

03:34.327 --> 03:35.526
What did I say?

Yeah, well, as far as
scares go, these guys

Dispatch said one suitcase.
I see three.

KONO: Yeah, HPD found these other two
in the last half hour.

03:44.303 --> 03:45.983

a dumping ground.

STEVE: Any idea how long
they're been out here?

about a week.

All right,

I want ground radar.

03:57.116 --> 03:59.817

There could be more.

03:59.819 --> 04:02.186
Call Max.

04:02.188 --> 04:03.654
Have him clear his schedule.

04:03.656 --> 04:06.123

killer on our hands.

04:29.096 --> 04:31.463
STEVE: <i> All right, Max,</i>

04:31.465 --> 04:33.699
you finish processing
our three Jane Does?

04:33.701 --> 04:36.368
Actually, gentlemen,
there are four Jane Does.

04:36.370 --> 04:39.004
Wait a minute, I thought
there was three bodies

04:39.006 --> 04:41.139
in three suitcases.
Upon closer investigation,

04:41.141 --> 04:44.243
each piece of luggage contained
a scrambled jigsaw puzzle

04:44.245 --> 04:45.511
of different
body parts

04:45.513 --> 04:48.313
from four female victims.

04:48.315 --> 04:50.716
And as you can see,
each victim

04:50.718 --> 04:52.851
has key segments
of their anatomy missing.

04:52.853 --> 04:56.488
But CSU swept that area twice,
so they got everything.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.524
I'm thinking the killer's
holding on to them.

04:58.526 --> 04:59.892
A souvenir.

04:59.894 --> 05:01.660
I don't understood that.
Why would someone do that?

05:01.662 --> 05:03.962
I mean, I understand, like, a-a
trophy from a bowling league

05:03.964 --> 05:05.397
or a hockey team or
something like that,

05:05.399 --> 05:07.666
but a body part?
Curiously, I detected

05:07.668 --> 05:10.102
trace levels
of formaldehyde and methanol--

05:10.104 --> 05:11.770
chemicals commonly used
for embalming,

05:11.772 --> 05:13.605
However,
none of the corpses

05:13.607 --> 05:15.507
have actually been embalmed.

05:15.509 --> 05:17.643
All right, we need to start
pulling employee records

05:17.645 --> 05:19.578
for mortuaries,
funeral homes,

05:19.580 --> 05:21.280
local cemeteries
and start pulling

05:21.282 --> 05:23.882
a list of potential suspects.
What else you got for us, Max?

05:23.884 --> 05:26.084
Um, this, uh,
the horizontal furrows

05:26.086 --> 05:28.020
on the victims' neck

05:28.022 --> 05:30.389
suggest death by strangulation.

05:30.391 --> 05:33.125
Do we have any idea
when this happened?

05:33.127 --> 05:35.294
Well, based on the level
of putrification

05:35.296 --> 05:36.528
and presence of larvae,

05:36.530 --> 05:38.363
I'd estimate the corpses
to be about

05:38.365 --> 05:41.600
six to ten days old.
However, I did find

05:41.602 --> 05:43.936
freezer burn on the skin
of two of our victims

05:43.938 --> 05:46.204
and ice crystals
in the heart of a third.

05:46.206 --> 05:47.739
That makes
determining T.O.D.

05:47.741 --> 05:49.274
nearly impossible.

05:49.276 --> 05:50.809
You're telling me he froze them

05:50.811 --> 05:52.311
after he killed
and dismembered them

05:52.313 --> 05:54.413
and then he dumped 'em at a
later date, is that right?

05:54.415 --> 05:55.614
That is my supposition.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.449
So, basically,
we have no idea.

05:57.451 --> 05:59.585
We don't know. It could've been
a week, could've been months.

05:59.587 --> 06:01.320
Meanwhile this whack job's
still walking around.

06:01.322 --> 06:02.955
Well, it's a common
misconception

06:02.957 --> 06:04.656
that most serial killers
are insane.

06:04.658 --> 06:06.391
However, more often than not,

06:06.393 --> 06:08.060
they are consummate chameleons

06:08.062 --> 06:11.129
They're able to hide their rage
and their true intentions

06:11.131 --> 06:12.764
behind a more
civilized facade,

06:12.766 --> 06:15.233
what we refer to
as the mask of sanity.

06:15.235 --> 06:18.604
He's likely hiding in plain
sight, scouting the victims.

06:18.606 --> 06:21.840
They kill their victims
in one location and

06:21.842 --> 06:24.543
dispose of them in another.

06:24.545 --> 06:28.246

Listen to me, Th...

06:33.287 --> 06:35.387
if you want off this case,
it's not a problem.

06:35.389 --> 06:38.223
No, I-I... I thank you
for that, Commander.

06:38.225 --> 06:40.859
Your sensitivity
towards the murder

06:40.861 --> 06:42.094
of my biological mother

06:42.096 --> 06:44.963
is greatly appreciated.
However, I truly believe

06:44.965 --> 06:46.865
that my expertise
in serial killers

06:46.867 --> 06:48.266
and their modus operandi

06:48.268 --> 06:50.836
will be a great asset
to this investigation.

06:50.838 --> 06:52.304
Oh, we feel the same way,

06:52.306 --> 06:54.239
all right?

06:54.241 --> 06:56.541
Stay close
on this one.

06:56.543 --> 06:58.377
All right. Okay,
these women

06:58.379 --> 07:01.146
were not randomly selected.
They were hand-picked.

07:01.148 --> 07:02.514
So we ID these women,
we find out

07:02.516 --> 07:03.749
who they came in contact with,

07:03.751 --> 07:06.652
and that's how we find
our killer, all right?

07:06.654 --> 07:08.687
Thanks, Max.
Oh, a-actually, uh,

07:08.689 --> 07:10.522
there is one
more thing.

07:10.524 --> 07:11.790
What's up?

07:11.792 --> 07:14.860
I'm just perplexed

07:14.862 --> 07:18.664
at the apparent lack of
curiosity regarding my costume.

07:18.666 --> 07:20.265
You're wearing a costume?

07:20.267 --> 07:23.235
Ah, there it is. A pithy retort
laced with just a hint

07:23.237 --> 07:24.903
of condescension.
Order is restored.

07:24.905 --> 07:27.539
Okay, who is it?

07:27.541 --> 07:30.542
Oh, you want us
to guess who it is.

07:30.544 --> 07:31.843
Uh, George Washington's wife.

07:31.845 --> 07:33.612
Martha Washington.

07:33.614 --> 07:35.614
I'm clearly one of Keanu Reeves'

07:35.616 --> 07:38.950
first film characters:
Chevalier Raphael Danceny.

07:38.952 --> 07:41.486
I'm, I... I-I'm not a...

07:41.488 --> 07:44.656
Well, I'm not surprised,
Commander, that you are unaware

07:44.658 --> 07:48.226
of Stephen Frears' seminal art
house film <i> Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

07:48.228 --> 07:50.929
And I surmise

07:50.931 --> 07:53.598
the lack of car chases
and explosions

07:53.600 --> 07:55.100
did not pique your interest.

07:55.102 --> 07:56.735
Got you there.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.371
Excuse me? Got <i> me</i> there--
oh, you saw that movie?

07:59.373 --> 08:00.906
Didn't see that movie.
When did you see that movie?

08:00.908 --> 08:02.307
1988. 1988?
Oh, gentlemen, uh, please

08:02.309 --> 08:03.775
take your tedious
discourse elsewhere.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.977
When was the movie made? 19...
It was, probably wasn't even

08:05.979 --> 08:07.913
made in... Don't put your finger
in, you're gonna burn it. <i>Adieu, adieu.</i>

08:07.915 --> 08:09.181
I remember,
I definitely...

08:19.493 --> 08:21.560
(Transylvanian accent):
I'm here to donate blood.

08:21.562 --> 08:23.862
I am Prince Vlad the third.

08:23.864 --> 08:25.597
aka Vlad the Impaler,

08:25.599 --> 08:27.632
aka Dracula.

08:27.634 --> 08:29.801
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

08:32.972 --> 08:34.706
Anyway, I come here

08:34.707 --> 08:37.743
every year dressed like this
to donate blood.

08:37.745 --> 08:40.078
Except for last year,
when I got kidnapped

08:40.080 --> 08:42.047
and helped take down
a counterfeiter that was

08:42.049 --> 08:43.482
trying to restart the IRA.

08:43.484 --> 08:45.383
Fill this out.

08:45.385 --> 08:46.885
I'll need to check
your iron level

08:46.887 --> 08:49.287
and your blood pressure to
make sure you're safe to donate.

08:49.289 --> 08:50.622
Is that 'cause I'm a heavy guy?

08:50.624 --> 08:53.325
No, because you're a vampire.

KONO:
<i>CSU went through the luggage</i>

09:01.935 --> 09:04.402
found at the crime scene.
Two of the bags were generic,

09:04.404 --> 09:06.905
had no tags or markings.
Lucky for us, though, one of our vics

09:06.907 --> 09:08.640
had really expensive taste.

09:08.642 --> 09:10.909
This is Porter Luggage.
It's a top-of-the-line

09:10.911 --> 09:12.344
European brand.
Each piece

09:12.346 --> 09:13.812
has its own unique
serial number.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.280
It was registered to...

09:15.282 --> 09:18.116
Kimberly Payne,
a UK resident.

09:18.118 --> 09:19.384
She's one of our vics.

09:19.386 --> 09:20.719
Well, Interpol
has a Yellow notice

09:20.721 --> 09:22.721
on her. She's been
missing three months.

09:22.723 --> 09:25.924
KONO: We know that she went through
Honolulu International customs.

09:25.926 --> 09:27.659
She prepaid for her room
at the Kahala Resort,

09:27.661 --> 09:29.427
but according to their records,
she never checked in.

09:29.429 --> 09:31.530
Okay, so our killer
must have picked her up

09:31.532 --> 09:33.265
somewhere between
the airport and the hotel.

09:33.267 --> 09:35.634
Was she traveling with anybody?
Or meet anybody here?

09:35.636 --> 09:37.335
According to
the missing persons report

09:37.337 --> 09:40.539
filed by her family,
she was just on vacation alone.

09:42.209 --> 09:44.142
All right, Kono, do me a favor--
call the family.

09:44.144 --> 09:46.111
Tell them we found
their daughter, please.

09:46.113 --> 09:48.113
Will do.
(phone rings)

09:48.115 --> 09:51.817
Yeah, Eric,
what do you got?

09:51.819 --> 09:53.385
You like?

09:53.387 --> 09:54.786
That is very nice, E-Train.

09:54.788 --> 09:56.054
What is it?

09:56.056 --> 09:57.222
It's a gift.

09:57.224 --> 10:00.192
From beyond the grave.

10:00.194 --> 10:01.493
(imitates fading buzz)

10:02.362 --> 10:03.495
Uh, right.

10:03.497 --> 10:04.629
Sorry, I'm still...

10:04.631 --> 10:06.898
developing
my presentation style.

10:06.900 --> 10:07.999
(clears throat)

10:08.001 --> 10:09.701
HPD found this
on one of the bodies.

10:09.703 --> 10:11.636
Okay, so it belonged
to one of the vics.

10:11.638 --> 10:12.838
Maybe.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.573
Or our killer put it there.

10:14.575 --> 10:16.141
Why would he do that?
Because.

10:16.143 --> 10:17.776
It's a black magic amulet.

10:17.778 --> 10:19.744
Part of some creepy serial
killer ritual or whatever.

10:19.746 --> 10:21.746
This inscription right here,
it's a protection charm,

10:21.748 --> 10:24.182
most commonly used in occult
ceremonies performed

10:24.184 --> 10:26.017
to bind two people
together. Not a very good

10:26.019 --> 10:28.086
protection charm, though,
if you ask me, am I right?

10:28.088 --> 10:30.422
(chuckles)

10:30.424 --> 10:33.358
You know, 'cause she was
chopped all up in a bag, right?

10:33.360 --> 10:36.261
Guys, look, uh, all right,
look, maybe it makes sense

10:36.263 --> 10:38.697
if it's our killer's way
of linking himself to the Vic?

10:38.699 --> 10:40.065
Okay, that's...
that's pretty good.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.466
Since when do you speak Latin?

10:41.468 --> 10:43.368
I don't.
I Binged it, dude.

10:43.370 --> 10:45.203
You know, where you type things
in to the little bar and...

10:45.205 --> 10:46.605
Yeah, I know
what that is.

10:46.607 --> 10:47.672
All right, well, I'm not
always sure, 'cause

10:47.674 --> 10:48.907
you were born
before the Internet

10:48.909 --> 10:50.041
and all that.

10:50.043 --> 10:52.410
Wow. You want to sleep
in the garage tonight?

10:52.412 --> 10:53.812
Hey, however you
want this to go down,

10:53.814 --> 10:54.946
Uncle D...
Hey.

10:54.948 --> 10:56.882
...tective Williams.

10:56.884 --> 10:58.817
Hey, this looks like
there's a piece missing.

10:58.819 --> 11:00.252
ERIC:
Very good.

11:00.254 --> 11:03.421
Originally it looked like this.

11:03.423 --> 11:05.223
(computer chirping)

11:05.225 --> 11:06.591
(blipping)

11:06.593 --> 11:08.593
What is that, blood?

11:08.595 --> 11:12.030
Yup... which I ran
just before you arrived,

11:12.032 --> 11:13.231
and guess what?

11:13.233 --> 11:15.267
I don't want to guess.
Right, uh,

11:15.269 --> 11:16.735
I got a hit.

11:16.737 --> 11:18.503
(computer chirps)

11:18.505 --> 11:21.706
All right, Mark Shepperd, 32,
got a record.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.943
Misdemeanor animal hoarding
and cruelty.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.412
Possession, assault.

11:27.414 --> 11:30.649
And interest in the occult
by the looks of that ink.

11:30.651 --> 11:32.984
And that creepy,

11:32.986 --> 11:35.387
dead expression in his eyes.

11:35.389 --> 11:38.890
DANNY: He's got the perfect
serial killer resume.

11:42.362 --> 11:45.931
I'm losing sensation in my hand.

11:47.034 --> 11:49.968
That's normal right?

11:50.938 --> 11:53.138
I'm sure you know
what you're doing.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.839
Of course you do.

11:54.841 --> 11:56.341
Seriously, though, if blood
doesn't get to my fingers,

11:56.343 --> 11:58.276
they could turn
gangrenous, right?

11:58.278 --> 12:01.713
I'll just shut up
and let you, uh...

12:01.715 --> 12:04.282
(machine gunfire)
MAN: Everybody, down.

12:04.284 --> 12:05.417
(people screaming)

12:05.419 --> 12:06.918
Down!
On the floor right now!

12:06.920 --> 12:09.454
Down! Down! On the
floor. Don't move!

12:09.456 --> 12:11.456
(phone plays tune)
Hey, Jerry. Great costume.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.757
Mind if I call you back?

12:12.759 --> 12:14.726
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

12:14.728 --> 12:16.261
Yeah, you and me both.

12:16.263 --> 12:18.663
I'm at the Hawaiian United
Blood Bank on Dillingham.

12:18.665 --> 12:21.132
Of course you are.
I'm sure they love the costume.

12:21.134 --> 12:22.968
No, listen,
there's something's going down.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.035
(machine gunfire)

12:24.037 --> 12:25.337
You hear that?

12:25.339 --> 12:27.105
Is that what I thought it was?

12:27.107 --> 12:30.075
Yeah, it's bullets hitting wood
and glass and metal.

12:30.077 --> 12:32.143
Hopefully not people,
but I don't know.

12:32.145 --> 12:34.713
Some guys just stormed in
here and took over the place.

12:34.715 --> 12:35.714
Okay, how many?

12:35.716 --> 12:37.382
More than one.

12:37.384 --> 12:40.285
I can't see. I'm in an exam room
with a phlebotomist.

12:40.287 --> 12:41.886
Are you guys safe there?
For now.

12:41.888 --> 12:42.854
Okay, hang tight.

12:42.856 --> 12:44.222
We're on our way.

12:51.531 --> 12:53.732
(knocking)

12:53.734 --> 12:57.369
Mark Shepperd, this is
Five-O! Open up!

12:57.371 --> 12:58.570
(thud)

12:58.572 --> 13:00.038
You hear that?

13:11.818 --> 13:14.953
Steve!

13:14.955 --> 13:17.222
Steve?!

13:34.274 --> 13:37.342
Come on! Come on!

13:53.111 --> 13:55.779
You know, you came
close there, pal.

13:55.879 --> 13:57.311
You should've left me up there.

13:57.313 --> 14:00.214
Okay, first of all, you don't
tell me what I should've done.

14:00.216 --> 14:01.415
Secondly,
you're not that lucky.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.484
You're gonna pay
for what you did to those women.

14:03.486 --> 14:07.522
What are you talking about?

14:07.524 --> 14:09.824
You recognize that thing?

14:09.826 --> 14:11.893
Yeah, it's my girlfriend's.

14:11.895 --> 14:14.128
My <i> ex-girlfriend.</i>

14:14.130 --> 14:15.263
Yeah, what's her name?

14:15.265 --> 14:16.631
Tamara Craig.

14:16.633 --> 14:19.767
She, uh... she one
of these girls?

14:21.871 --> 14:24.305
That-that's her.
Oh, my God, that's Tamara.

14:24.307 --> 14:25.540
What happened to her?

14:25.542 --> 14:27.408
Well, that's what
we're here to ask you.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.143
You see, we found
that amulet

14:29.145 --> 14:31.345
with your blood in it
at the crime scene.

14:31.347 --> 14:32.947
Well, you think
that I did this?

14:32.949 --> 14:35.249
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We exchanged amulets,

14:35.251 --> 14:36.551
yes, but it was her idea,

14:36.553 --> 14:38.352
you know,
like Angie and Billy Bob.

14:38.354 --> 14:40.421
It was our way
of always being with each other.

14:40.423 --> 14:43.191
Where's yours?
In my trash at home.

14:43.193 --> 14:45.760
I threw it away
right before, uh...

14:45.762 --> 14:46.894
Before, um, what?

14:46.896 --> 14:49.197
(sighs)

14:49.199 --> 14:51.866
Right before
I tried to kill myself.

14:53.770 --> 14:56.904
Tamara was my whole reason
for living.

14:56.906 --> 14:58.139
I could never hurt her.

14:58.141 --> 14:59.574
When she broke
up with me,

14:59.576 --> 15:01.509
I lost everything.

15:01.511 --> 15:03.978
When was the last time
you saw her?

15:03.980 --> 15:06.280
Five weeks ago,
we had a blow-out.

15:06.282 --> 15:08.649
She went to Hong Kong
to visit one of her friends.

15:08.651 --> 15:11.252
Um, I thought that she would
just cool off and come back

15:11.254 --> 15:12.453
like she always did.

15:12.455 --> 15:14.121
But she didn't.

15:14.123 --> 15:16.357
She didn't
answer my calls.

15:16.359 --> 15:18.392
She didn't answer my texts.

15:18.394 --> 15:22.730
I finally realized
that it was just over.

15:22.732 --> 15:24.932
That I was never
gonna see her again.

15:28.071 --> 15:30.871
(buzzer sounds)
Where are you going?

15:30.873 --> 15:33.074
You're just gonna
leave me here?!

15:34.978 --> 15:38.679
Okay, he's not our guy.
No, I-I agree. He's got that,

15:38.681 --> 15:40.181
uh, emo sensitive...
I mean, he's...

15:40.183 --> 15:41.649
I'm-gonna-write
a-really-terrible-love-song

15:41.651 --> 15:42.783
about-the-girl kind of vibe,

15:42.785 --> 15:44.452
but multiple homicides--
I don't think so.

15:44.454 --> 15:47.355
Call HPD, have them come get
him, take him to King's Medical.

15:47.357 --> 15:49.189
I want a full MH-1 psych
eval on the guy, okay?

15:49.213 --> 15:49.858
All right.

15:49.859 --> 15:52.059
That's gonna give us time
to verify his story. (phone ringing)

15:52.061 --> 15:54.762
In the meantime, let's pull what
we can find on Tamara Craig.

15:54.764 --> 15:56.897
See if there's any connection to
the other Vic, Kimberly Payne.

15:56.899 --> 15:59.400
I got to take this.
Okay.

15:59.402 --> 16:02.503
Hello.

16:02.505 --> 16:04.538
Rachel, slow down.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.307
Slow-slow down.

16:07.877 --> 16:09.477
Where is she now?

16:09.479 --> 16:11.479
Okay, don't...
I will take care...

16:11.481 --> 16:13.848
I'm gonna go find her,
I'm gonna pick her up,

16:13.850 --> 16:16.050
and I'll take her
back to the house, okay?

16:16.052 --> 16:17.518
Please, everything's
gonna be fine.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.620
I will call you
the second I have her.

16:19.622 --> 16:21.422
I got it. Okay?
Trust me. Okay, bye.

16:21.424 --> 16:23.057
Is Gracie all right?
What's going on?

16:23.059 --> 16:25.926
Grace, uh, was supposed to be

16:25.928 --> 16:28.229
at a sleepover
at her friend's place in Kahala.

16:28.231 --> 16:30.498
Turns out she lied,
and she is at a house party

16:30.500 --> 16:32.166
up on the North Shore.

16:32.168 --> 16:33.367
Go. I got this.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.936
Are you sure?
Am I sure? Your 13-year-old daughter

16:35.938 --> 16:38.172
is at a party on the other
side of the island, Danny.

16:38.174 --> 16:39.640
Good point.
Now I'm gonna kill <i> myself.</i>

16:39.642 --> 16:41.676
Don't kill yourself, Danny.
She'll be fine.

16:41.678 --> 16:43.711
(siren blaring)

16:43.713 --> 16:47.181
(engine revving)

16:48.351 --> 16:49.984
(siren blaring)

16:49.986 --> 16:53.187
(garbled radio transmission)

16:53.189 --> 16:55.323
Hey, Duke.

16:55.325 --> 16:57.725
Kono, Chin,
shooters fled the scene.

16:57.727 --> 16:58.893
We have APBs out.

16:58.895 --> 17:00.561
Nothing but minor injuries
inside.

17:00.563 --> 17:01.996
Thanks, Duke.

17:03.966 --> 17:06.200
Hey, Jerry, you okay?

17:06.202 --> 17:09.002
Uh, blood pressure's a little
high. Otherwise, I'm good.

17:09.005 --> 17:10.304
Manager

17:10.306 --> 17:11.705
got a little roughed
up, but I think

17:11.708 --> 17:13.107
everyone else is just
a little freaked out.

17:13.108 --> 17:15.675
Oh, this is Lia, the
phlebotomist I told you about.

17:15.678 --> 17:16.810
Lia, these are my partners.

17:16.813 --> 17:18.346
Any idea what they took?

17:18.348 --> 17:19.980
Blood.
Blood?

17:19.982 --> 17:22.116
Lots of it.

17:22.117 --> 17:23.951
CHIN: What kind of
thieves take blood?

17:23.953 --> 17:25.653
Vampires.

17:33.129 --> 17:35.096
Someone was
in a hurry.

17:35.098 --> 17:38.632
Looks like they took most of our
packed cells of Jk3-negative.

17:38.634 --> 17:39.967
Oh, that's really rare.

17:39.969 --> 17:41.535
Impressive.

17:41.537 --> 17:43.137
He's right.

17:43.139 --> 17:45.673
Jk3-neg is only found in one
in 10,000 people

17:45.675 --> 17:48.476
in Hawaii, mainly
Polynesians and Asians.

17:48.478 --> 17:50.711
So, blood that rare
could be a black market play.

17:50.713 --> 17:53.347
Only its value comes
with an expiration date.

17:53.349 --> 17:55.149
Unless it's refrigerated
correctly,

17:55.151 --> 17:57.385
it has to be hung within
30 minutes of leaving here.

17:57.387 --> 17:58.386
And the transfusion

17:58.388 --> 17:59.787
has to be performed by someone

17:59.789 --> 18:01.088
who knows what
they're doing.

18:01.090 --> 18:02.857
If I want blood,
I'm going to an ER,

18:02.859 --> 18:04.892
unless, of course, doing that
is gonna get me arrested

18:04.894 --> 18:06.026
because I'm a criminal.

18:06.028 --> 18:08.095
So, someone's
in desperate need of blood,

18:08.097 --> 18:09.864
and this was
stolen to order.

18:14.103 --> 18:16.570
GROVER: <i>So, I dug</i>
<i>into Tamara Craig's background.</i>

18:16.572 --> 18:18.706
Now, there's nothing
directly connecting her

18:18.708 --> 18:21.542
to our other Vic,
Kimberly Payne, but then,

18:21.544 --> 18:24.145
I ran Tamara's phone records.

18:24.147 --> 18:27.181
Turns out the last call
she made from her cell phone

18:27.183 --> 18:29.617
was right after she arrived
at Honolulu International

18:29.619 --> 18:31.252
from Osaka three weeks ago.

18:31.254 --> 18:34.522

any information?

29:29.747 --> 29:31.080
Yes.
Thank you.

29:31.082 --> 29:32.848
The luggage tags checked out.

29:32.850 --> 29:35.351
Amanda Lombard was
a Nevada resident.

29:35.353 --> 29:37.720
She was on the California
Department of Justice

29:37.722 --> 29:38.988
missing persons list.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.257
Monica Segert was
a German national.

29:41.259 --> 29:43.292
She went missing
over a year ago.

29:43.294 --> 29:47.129
She was flying as a student on
an around-the- world airline ticket.

29:47.131 --> 29:50.232
Both the I.D.'s were a direct
match to both our vics.

29:50.234 --> 29:51.701
All right.
What about the woman

29:51.703 --> 29:53.135
in the photograph
we found inside.

29:53.137 --> 29:54.804
The picture you found
was a bit faded

29:54.806 --> 29:56.472
and makes it difficult
to run facial recognition--

29:56.474 --> 29:59.108
<i>unless</i> you're
a forensic phenom.

29:59.110 --> 30:02.545
I did a digital reconstruct
on her face, and... got a hit

30:02.547 --> 30:04.480
on a driver's license.

30:04.482 --> 30:07.616
Nice. “Maggie King.”

30:07.618 --> 30:09.151
Her employee records
show she worked

30:09.153 --> 30:11.053
at the East Memorial
Funeral Home.

30:11.055 --> 30:14.256
That's the same place that our
suspect, Charles Oakman, worked.

30:14.258 --> 30:16.926
I'm thinking workplace romance.
Which came to an abrupt end

30:16.928 --> 30:19.662
three years ago when
she was killed in plane crash

30:19.664 --> 30:21.297
in Uruguay.

30:21.299 --> 30:23.399
Her unexpected death
was probably the trauma

30:23.401 --> 30:25.901
that triggered Mr. Oakman's
murderous proclivities.

30:25.903 --> 30:29.005
STEVE: That's it--
that's where she left him at the airport.

30:29.007 --> 30:30.339
She never came back again.

30:30.341 --> 30:32.008
And now that's
where he sees her,

30:32.010 --> 30:33.776
over and over again,
in these other women.

30:33.778 --> 30:35.311
GROVER:
Look at this.

30:35.313 --> 30:37.213
Maggie had a cottage

30:37.215 --> 30:40.216
registered in her name.
Now, it's in a really remote location--

30:40.218 --> 30:42.451
it's out by Kipapa Gulch.

30:42.453 --> 30:44.687
That's it. That's
got to be the place

30:44.689 --> 30:46.655
he's processing those bodies.

30:54.165 --> 30:55.464
(sighs heavily)

30:55.466 --> 30:57.733
You know, Grace, um...

30:57.735 --> 30:59.635
I know that you
think you are

30:59.637 --> 31:01.537
mature enough to make
your own decisions,

31:01.539 --> 31:02.872
but you are not, okay?

31:02.874 --> 31:04.240
Someday you will.

31:04.242 --> 31:06.275
Someday you will be able
to make your own decisions,

31:06.277 --> 31:09.145
God help my anxiety levels.
And who knows,

31:09.147 --> 31:11.680
maybe someday you will have
children of your own,

31:11.682 --> 31:14.450
and you will know what your
mother and I go through.

31:16.187 --> 31:17.920
I'm your father,

31:17.922 --> 31:20.322

31:20.324 --> 31:21.957
from the bad things that
could potentially happen.

31:21.959 --> 31:24.660
And there are a lot of things that could
happen that keeps me

31:24.662 --> 31:28.130
laying awake at night,
you understand?

31:28.132 --> 31:29.832
I'm not trying to ruin
your fun, Grace.

31:29.834 --> 31:31.434
I want you to have
a good time.

31:31.436 --> 31:32.735
That's not what this
is about, okay?

31:32.737 --> 31:34.470
I'm trying to protect you--
protect you

31:34.472 --> 31:36.205
