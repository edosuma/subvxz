PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE,
THIS GUY IS A DUMB FARMER,

04:41.350 --> 04:42.282
I'VE GOT HIM.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.766
THESE ARE MY BABIES.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.941

04:51.187 --> 04:53.914
I'VE GOT THIS NOTEBOOK
THAT I WRITE IN EVERY

04:53.948 --> 04:56.572
SEASON ABOUT WHAT I WOULD

04:56.606 --> 05:00.817
I'M NOT JUST A FAN; I'M A

05:00.852 --> 05:02.198
COME ON, GIRL.

05:02.232 --> 05:04.994
I'M HERE TO WIN $500,000.

05:05.028 --> 05:10.827
GO BIG OR GO HOME, SO WHY
NOT RISK THE BUSINESS.

05:10.862 --> 05:13.002
MY NAME IS XAVIER, I'M
AN ATTORNEY IN A BUSINESS

05:13.036 --> 05:16.246
LAW FIRM FROM MILWAUKEE,
WISCONSIN.

05:16.281 --> 05:21.424
I DECIDED TO BECOME A
LAYER LAWYER BECAUSE I HAVE A

05:21.459 --> 05:25.739
STRONG DESIRE TO HELP
PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE

05:25.773 --> 05:26.809
OF COLOR.

05:26.843 --> 05:28.914
WHEN I WAS PLAYING COLLEGE
BASKETBALL, I HAD STRONG

05:28.949 --> 05:31.020
ASPIRATIONS OF PLAYING
PROFESSIONAL BALL, AND I

05:31.054 --> 05:34.368
ENDED UP TEARING MY A.C.L.

05:34.403 --> 05:35.645
MY JUNIOR YEAR.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.890
LIFE HAS DEFINITELY KICKED
ME IN THE MOUTH, I ADAPTED

05:38.924 --> 05:42.031
TO FIND SUCCESS, AND I'M
HOPING TO DO THAT IN THE

05:42.065 --> 05:42.445
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.722
I AM SINGLE.

05:43.757 --> 05:47.450
I'M GOING TO TRY TO AVOID
A SHOWMANCE.

05:47.485 --> 05:50.695
I DON'T SEE IT BEING
BENEFICIAL TO MY GAME.

05:50.729 --> 05:54.319
AND THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE IS USUALLY A COOL

05:54.354 --> 05:56.942
LINE FOR MANIPULATING, AND
I'M A LAWYER, SO IT IS NOT

05:56.977 --> 05:57.874
A GOOD THING.

05:57.909 --> 06:00.670
I WILL LIKELY TELL THEM
I'M A BARTENDER.

06:00.705 --> 06:01.982
I'M A MAN ON A MISSION.

06:02.016 --> 06:04.398
I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO
AND I'M READY TO DO IT.

06:04.433 --> 06:09.886
HERE WE ARE.

06:09.921 --> 06:16.583

06:21.139 --> 06:22.416
SUMMER OF YOUR LIVES.

06:22.451 --> 06:27.283
AS YOU KNOW, IN THIS GAME,
EVERY DECISION CAN BE VERY

06:27.317 --> 06:31.425
RISKY, WHOM TO ALIGN WITH,
WHOM TO BETRAY, WHEN TO

06:31.460 --> 06:36.016
LIE LOW, AND WHEN TO MAKE
A BOLD MOVE.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.674
WELL, GET READY, BECAUSE
THIS SUMMER YOU WILL BE

06:38.708 --> 06:42.816
FORCED TO TAKE EXTREME
RISKS FOR HUGE REWARDS

06:42.850 --> 06:46.958
LIKE NO OTHER HOUSEGUESTS
IN THE HISTORY OF "BIG

06:46.992 --> 06:47.890

06:47.924 --> 06:50.893
ONE WRONG MOVE COULD COST
YOU EVERYTHING.

06:50.927 --> 06:56.588
SO, WHO IS READY TO GET
THIS GAME STARTED?

06:56.623 --> 06:58.072

COMPETITION MY BIG ASS CAN

07:56.683 --> 07:57.718
WIN, I'M GOING FOR IT.

07:57.753 --> 07:59.996
IF I CAN'T WIN THAT
COMPETITION, I'M

08:00.031 --> 08:01.895
DEFINITELY GOING TO STAY
LOW.

08:01.929 --> 08:03.413
WOW, OKAY.

08:03.448 --> 08:08.039
EVERYBODY LOOKS REALLY
GOOD, BY THE WAY.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.247
IT IS HUGE.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.801
IT IS BIGGER THAN WHAT I
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

08:11.836 --> 08:12.146
BE.

08:12.181 --> 08:15.184
I KNOW.

08:15.218 --> 08:20.051
KEEP GOING TO

12:23.915 --> 12:26.193
INTO THEIR NEW SUMMER HOME
AND COMPETED FOR THE POWER

12:26.228 --> 12:29.024

12:29.058 --> 12:30.715
SO WHO IS MOVING IN NEXT?

12:30.750 --> 12:35.409
IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT.

12:35.444 --> 12:36.894
AHH!

12:36.928 --> 12:41.001
> I GOT THE KEY.

12:41.036 --> 12:45.350
OH, MY GOSH!

12:45.385 --> 12:46.835
STOP!

12:46.869 --> 12:49.078
I'M GOING TO ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

12:49.113 --> 12:53.531
I'M GOING ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

12:53.565 --> 12:56.914
MY NAME IS AZAH, I

12:56.948 --> 13:01.539
CURRENTLY WORK IN TECH,
I'M FROM TACOMA PARK,

13:01.573 --> 13:02.298
MARYLAND.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.060
I'M A FIRST GENERATION
AMERICAN.

13:05.094 --> 13:11.929
MY FAME IS FROM AFRICA,
AND MY GRANDFATHER WAS

13:11.963 --> 13:15.553
PARLIAMENT TO THE KING,
AND MY FATHER WAS ONE OVER

13:15.587 --> 13:19.488
47 CHILDREN, AND I HAVE
OVER 300 COUSINS.

13:19.522 --> 13:20.523
HEY, DADDY!

13:20.558 --> 13:24.355
GROWING UP AS A PASTOR'S
KID, I HAD A VERY, VERY,

13:24.389 --> 13:26.115
VERY STRICT UPBRINGING.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.359
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
GUY YOU USED TO TALK TO?

13:28.393 --> 13:29.601
WHICH ONE?

13:29.636 --> 13:33.605
BUT I'M A LITTLE BOY
CRAZY, JUST A LITTLE, TINY

13:33.640 --> 13:34.572
BIT.

13:34.606 --> 13:39.577
SO I MADE A RULE IN THE
HOUSE, NO PENIS, NO

13:39.611 --> 13:41.613
SHOWMANCES, NO, NO, NO.

13:41.648 --> 13:45.652
WA WHATCHA GONNA DO WITH
THE COMPETITION?

13:45.686 --> 13:47.447
I'M HERE TO WIN.

13:47.481 --> 13:49.621
I'M HERE TO GET THE 500K.

13:49.656 --> 13:55.731
I'M GOING TO KICK OUT THE
COMPETITION ONE BY ONE,

13:55.765 --> 13:56.801
YES!

13:56.836 --> 14:02.876
MY NAME IS BRITINI, AND
I JUST GRADUATED WITH MY

14:02.911 --> 14:04.015
MASTER'S OF SCIENCE IN
EDUCATION.

14:04.050 --> 14:09.607
I DID TWO DIFFERENT MAJORS
IN THE SAME FOUR-YEAR TIME

14:09.641 --> 14:11.989
SPAN AND GRADUATED
VALEDICTORIAN IN MY CLASS.

14:12.023 --> 14:16.027
I'VE BEEN DOING KARATE
EVER SINCE I WAS 12.

14:16.062 --> 14:18.271
I'M A THREE-TIME WORLD
CHAMPION.

14:18.305 --> 14:22.344
I HAD TO WORK FIVE TIMES
HARDER TO GET TO WHERE I

14:22.378 --> 14:26.900
AM TODAY BECAUSE WHEN I
WAS 24, I GOT DIAGNOSED

14:26.935 --> 14:27.832
WITH AUTISM.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.937
SO IT IS NOT EASY.

14:28.971 --> 14:31.387
IT IS NOT JUST DOING THIS
FOR ME.

14:31.422 --> 14:35.529
I'M DOING IT FOR EVERY,
SINGLE KID, WHO THANKS

14:35.564 --> 14:39.533
THINKSTHEY COULD DO THIS.

14:39.568 --> 14:39.982
WHY?

14:40.017 --> 14:40.914
BECAUSE YOU CAN.

14:40.949 --> 14:45.436
WHEN I STEP IN THAT HOUSE,
IT IS GAME OVER.

14:45.470 --> 14:46.955
THEY BETTER BE READY.

14:46.989 --> 14:48.025
LET'S GO!

14:48.059 --> 14:52.581
MY NAME IS ALYSSA, I
LIVE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA.

14:52.615 --> 14:56.757
PEOPLE THINK I'M JUST A
PRETTY FACE.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.588
BUT, ACTUALLY, I LAUNCH A
SWIMWEAR BRAND.

14:59.622 --> 15:03.868
I DESIGN THE SWIMSUITS, I
CREATE THE ADS, I DO IT

15:03.903 --> 15:04.938
ALL.

15:04.973 --> 15:07.078
GROWING UP WAS MUCH HARDER
THAN MOST OF MY FRIENDS.

15:07.113 --> 15:10.288
I KIND OF HAD TO GROW UP
ON MY OWN.

15:10.323 --> 15:11.876
I MOVED OUT AT 17.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.568
I CAN RELATE TO PEOPLE'S
STRUGGLES, AND I THINK I

15:14.603 --> 15:16.260
CAN BRING THE TO THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE.

15:16.294 --> 15:22.266
I THINK MY BEST ACCENT IS
ESPECIALLY MY SOCIAL GAME.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.372
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

15:25.407 --> 15:28.099
IF SOMETHING IS BOTHERING
ME, IT WILL COME OUT.

15:28.134 --> 15:29.894
I WEAR MY EMOTIONS ON MY
FACE.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.966
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO FAKE SMILE BECAUSE

15:33.001 --> 15:34.485
MY FAKE SMILE IS REALLY
BAD.

15:34.519 --> 15:35.935
I DON'T THINK IT IS GOING
TO WORK.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.524
I'M WHITNEY FROM HAPPY
VALLEY, OREGON.

15:39.559 --> 15:44.357
AND I OWN A FREE LANCE
MAKEUP COMPANY.

15:44.391 --> 15:47.947
PEOPLE WILL SEE THE WAY I
LOOK AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA

15:47.981 --> 15:49.638
WHAT I'VE DONE TO GET
HERE.

15:49.672 --> 15:52.227
I HAVE BEEN A SINGLE MOM
FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS.

15:52.261 --> 15:55.955
I USED TO BRING MY NEWBORN
SON TO WEDDINGS, AND I

15:55.989 --> 15:58.888
WENT FROM LIVING IN AN
ATTIC TO BEING A

15:58.923 --> 15:59.924
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNER.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.582
ONE OF THE REASONS I WANT
TO DO "BIG BROTHER" IS

16:02.616 --> 16:04.618
BECAUSE I WANT TO PROVIDE
FOR MY CHILDREN.

16:04.653 --> 16:06.862
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO WIN?

16:06.896 --> 16:08.933
SO WE CAN GET A NEW
JOB.

16:08.968 --> 16:13.248
I HAVE HORRIBLE TASTE
IN MEN.

16:13.282 --> 16:17.183
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A
SHOWMANCE, BUT IF THERE IS

16:17.217 --> 16:22.084
A TALL, HANDSOME MAN WITH
A BIG, BEAUTIFUL SMILE AND

16:22.119 --> 16:23.430
NICE MUSCLES, I'LL TRY.

16:23.465 --> 16:25.501
BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO
AFFECT MY GAME PLAY

16:25.536 --> 16:27.779
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO WIN
"BIG BROTHER."

16:27.814 --> 16:30.161
WHO IS GOING TO BE MY
BIGGEST FAN?

16:30.196 --> 16:32.336
ME!

16:32.370 --> 16:41.828
WHITNEY, AZAH,
ALYSSA, WELCOME TO "BIG

16:41.862 --> 16:42.829
BROTHER."

16:42.863 --> 16:46.902
SAY, I DO, IF YOU CONSIDER
YOURSELF A GAMBLER.

16:46.936 --> 16:48.248
NO GAMBLERS HERE?

16:48.283 --> 16:50.423
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR ALL
OF YOU BECAUSE THIS SUMMER

16:50.457 --> 16:53.633
YOU'LL BE STAYING IN A
HOUSE DESIGNED FOR

16:53.667 --> 16:54.116
GAMBLERS.

16:54.151 --> 16:55.152
THAT'S AWESOME.

16:55.186 --> 16:57.154
WE'LL SEE HOW
YOU DO, AND YOU'RE GOING

16:57.188 --> 16:59.052
TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT
MEANS LATER ON.

16:59.087 --> 17:00.157
ARE YOU READY TO MOVE IN?

17:00.191 --> 17:01.365
YES.

17:01.399 --> 17:02.090
DEFINITELY.

17:02.124 --> 17:03.608
WE'VE GOT THAT
GOING.

17:03.643 --> 17:07.681
WHEN YOU ENTER THE HOUSE,
DON'T DILLY-DALLY, GO

17:07.716 --> 17:10.270
STRAIGHT TO THE BACKYARD
WHERE YOU WILL BATTLE EACH

17:10.305 --> 17:12.376
OTHER IN YOUR VERY FIRST
COMPETITION.

17:12.410 --> 17:12.755
SOUND GOOD?

17:12.790 --> 17:15.551
GREAT.

17:15.586 --> 17:17.036
THEN THE HOUSE IS ALL
YOURS.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.727
OH, MY GOSH!

17:18.761 --> 17:21.143
OH, MY GOODNESS!

17:21.178 --> 17:24.008
STOP IT!

17:24.043 --> 17:26.424
AHH!

17:26.459 --> 17:27.736
C'MON!

17:27.770 --> 17:30.152
THIS IS SO PRETTY.

17:30.187 --> 17:32.189
GUYS, I'M BRITINI.

17:32.223 --> 17:34.467
NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:34.501 --> 17:36.158
YOU ALL ARE SO GORGEOUS.

17:36.193 --> 17:37.470
I JUST HAD TO SAY THAT.

17:37.504 --> 17:40.093
I'M COMING IN THIS
HOUSE TO WIN, PLAIN AND

17:40.128 --> 17:41.060
SIMPLE, THAT'S IT.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.442
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
ANYONE'S PAWN WEEK AFTER

17:44.477 --> 17:45.271
WEEK.

17:45.305 --> 17:47.514
THAT'S NOT HOW I'M PLAYING
THIS GAME.

17:47.549 --> 17:51.553
I'M UNAPOLOGETICALLY READY
TO BE A BAD ASS.

17:51.587 --> 17:52.001
LET'S GO.

17:52.036 --> 17:53.417
OH, MY GOSH!

17:53.451 --> 17:56.420
I DO NOT WANT TO WIN
THE FIRST COMPETITION.

17:56.454 --> 17:57.455
WHY?

17:57.490 --> 18:00.009
BECAUSE I PLAN TO TARGET
THE PERSON WHO WINS THE

18:00.044 --> 18:02.426
FIRST COMPETITION.

18:02.460 --> 18:07.465
OKAY, LADIES,
WELCOME TO THE KICK-OFF

18:07.500 --> 18:08.501
COMPETITION.

18:08.535 --> 18:11.607
YOU HAVE ALL ALREADY BEEN
BRIEFED ON THE RULES.

18:11.642 --> 18:15.335
GET YOUR SHOES OFF, THAT'S
RIGHT, BE COMFORTABLE.

18:15.370 --> 18:19.512
NOW, TO REITERATE, ON MY
GO, YOUR JOB IS TO TURN

18:19.546 --> 18:23.274
THE INCORRECT PLEXIGLASS
PUZZLE INTO THE CORRECT

18:23.309 --> 18:25.000
ONE AND HIT YOUR BUTTON.

18:39.946 --> 18:41.844

EXCELLENT.

20:10.830 --> 20:31.437

20:31.471 --> 20:36.131

WHITNEY,

20:51.457 --> 20:53.493

20:53.528 --> 20:56.634
WE STILL HAVE EIGHT MORE

WELCOME BACK

21:41.921 --> 21:48.997
IT'S TIME TO MEET THE NEXT
GROUP OF FOUR.

21:49.031 --> 21:52.552
YES!

21:52.587 --> 21:53.035

21:53.070 --> 21:54.243

21:54.278 --> 21:56.970
OH, MY GOSH!

21:57.005 --> 22:00.077
YAY!

22:00.111 --> 22:00.595
SURPRISE!

22:00.629 --> 22:03.045
ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.944
YES!

22:04.978 --> 22:05.669
I'M COMING!

22:05.703 --> 22:09.431
THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE
TICKET.

22:09.466 --> 22:14.816
MY NAME IS KYLAND
YOUNG, AND I CURRENTLY

22:14.850 --> 22:17.646
LIVE IN VENICE,
CALIFORNIA.

22:17.681 --> 22:20.269
I VOLUNTEER WITH A LOT OF
DIFFERENT NON-PROFITS, BUT

22:20.304 --> 22:24.515
ONE I'M REALLY PROUD OF,
I'M ON THE BOARD, CALLED

22:24.550 --> 22:27.069
URBAN SADDLES, BRINGING
INNER CITY KIDS AND THEIR

22:27.104 --> 22:29.900
FAMILIES TO THE RANCH TO
LEARN DIFFERENT LIFE

22:29.934 --> 22:32.178
SKILLS TO BE A
WELL-ROUNDED PERSON.

22:32.212 --> 22:36.631
I'M NOT EASILY DEFINED
BECAUSE I GREW UP IN TWO

22:36.665 --> 22:37.666
DIFFERENT CULTURES.

22:37.701 --> 22:39.150
MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN SIDE
AND MY MEXICAN-AMERICAN

22:39.185 --> 22:40.255
SIDE.

22:40.289 --> 22:42.878
I LEARNED A LOT OF MY WORK
ETHIC FROM MY GRANDFATHER,

22:42.913 --> 22:45.467
WHO IMMIGRATED FROM MEXICO
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG.

22:45.502 --> 22:48.125
HE ALWAYS TOLD ME I WANT
YOU TO LEARN HOW TO WORK

22:48.159 --> 22:49.402
AND DO BETTER.

22:49.437 --> 22:51.162
I EMBRACE EVERY CORNER OF
LIFE.

22:51.197 --> 22:58.756
I DEFINITELY DON'T FIT IN
ONE BOX, AND COLLEEN

22:58.791 --> 22:59.792
AGREES.

22:59.826 --> 23:05.073
I AM CHRISTIAN AND I'M
A GENERAL CONTRACTOR'S

23:05.107 --> 23:07.420
ASSISTANT.

23:07.455 --> 23:09.077
FALSE ALARM.

23:09.111 --> 23:09.974
FALSE TIMBER.

23:10.009 --> 23:14.531
RIGHT NOW I LIVE IN
CONNECTICUT, WITH MY

23:14.565 --> 23:15.566
PARENTS.

23:15.601 --> 23:17.706
NOTHING AGAINST THEM, BUT
I'M 43 YEARS OLD, SO I

23:17.741 --> 23:19.259
THINK IT IS TIME TO GET
OUT.

23:19.294 --> 23:21.054
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO HERE, SO I

23:21.089 --> 23:24.541
MAKE MY OWN FUN.

23:24.575 --> 23:27.578
YOU'VE GOT TO BE

23:27.613 --> 23:28.268
CREATIVE.

23:28.303 --> 23:29.269
I AM SINGLE.

23:29.304 --> 23:32.790
I THINK A SHOWMANCE IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

23:32.825 --> 23:35.586
MY CURLY HAIR IS GOING TO
TURN SOME HEADS.

23:35.621 --> 23:38.555
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT
TO TOUCH IT, GO AHEAD,

23:38.589 --> 23:39.901
TOUCH IT, PET IT.

23:39.935 --> 23:41.799
GIRLS LOVE THE CURLS.

23:41.834 --> 23:42.835
I'M A THREAT.

23:42.869 --> 23:47.011
BUT WITH MY FUN-LOVING
PUPPY ATTITUDE, PEOPLE ARE

23:47.046 --> 23:48.737
GOING TO UNDERESTIMATE ME.

23:48.772 --> 23:49.773
WELCOME TO THE GOOD LIFE.

23:49.807 --> 23:55.123
MY NAME IS DEREK, I'M
FROM BELAIRE, MARYLAND.

23:55.157 --> 23:58.471
I MAKE COOKING VIDEOS, AND
WE HELP TURN THE VIDEOS

23:58.506 --> 23:59.748
INTO MEAL KITS.

23:59.783 --> 24:03.580
I WAS THE ONLY ASIAN GUY
IN MY HISTORY, SO I ALWAYS

24:03.614 --> 24:04.477
FELT DIFFERENT.

24:04.512 --> 24:06.962
I WAS SUPER NERDY.

24:06.997 --> 24:09.137
THAT ALL CHANGED WHEN I
WENT TO COLLEGE.

24:09.171 --> 24:14.487
I JOINED A FRATERNITY.

24:14.522 --> 24:15.937
I'M EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.

24:15.971 --> 24:18.387
I PLAY TENNIS LIKE AT THE
STATE LEVEL.

24:18.422 --> 24:21.977
EVERYTHING I DO, I TRY TO
BE THE BEST AT IT.

24:22.012 --> 24:24.980
IT IS ONE OF THE LAST
TIMES I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

24:25.015 --> 24:27.535
MY PARENTS ARE SUPER
SUPPORTIVE, BUT THEY WOULD

24:27.569 --> 24:30.020
LOVE ME TO BE A DOCTOR, OF
COURSE, MAYBE A LAWYER,

24:30.054 --> 24:31.331
MAYBE THAT WOULD PASS.

24:31.366 --> 24:34.887
AT FIRST THEY DEFINITELY
DID NOT WANT ME TO GO ON

24:34.921 --> 24:35.922
THIS SHOW.

24:35.957 --> 24:39.408
I TOLD THEM I WOULD COME
HOME WITH $500,000 OR I

24:39.443 --> 24:40.893
WOULDN'T COME BACK AT ALL.

24:40.927 --> 24:44.034
DON'T COME BACK BEFORE
THAT.

24:44.068 --> 24:49.211
MY NAME IS BRENT
CHAMPAGNE.

24:49.246 --> 24:51.559
I'M AN INTERNATIONAL
FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

24:51.593 --> 24:54.562
I LOVE TO TRAVEL AND I
LOVE DIFFERENT CULTURES,

24:54.596 --> 24:56.598
SO IT WAS JUST THE PERFECT
THING.

24:56.633 --> 24:59.636
AND THE WOMEN HELPED.

24:59.670 --> 25:03.571
EVERYTHING IN NATURE IS
ONE OF THE BEST

25:03.605 --> 25:04.710
ATTRIBUTES.

25:04.744 --> 25:09.128
AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK
IT WILL PUT A HUGE TARGET

25:09.162 --> 25:10.129
ON MY BACK.

25:10.163 --> 25:14.064
IF I GO OUT THERE DOING
ONE-HANDED CARTWHEELS

25:14.098 --> 25:16.480
AFTER I WIN, PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO BE, LIKE, THIS

25:16.515 --> 25:17.550
GUY NEEDS TO GO.

25:17.585 --> 25:20.208
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO
USE A LOT OF CHARM.

25:20.242 --> 25:25.178
I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT
OF ITALIAN, JUST ENOUGH TO

25:25.213 --> 25:25.938
IMPRESS.

25:25.972 --> 25:27.353
IT COMES IN HANDY WITH
FLIRTING.

25:27.387 --> 25:30.459
SMILING IS EVERYTHING THAT
YOU CAN SAY TO THEIR

25:30.494 --> 25:32.807
FACE -- IF YOU SAY IT WITH
A SMILE, IT'S DIFFERENT.

25:32.841 --> 25:34.671
THAT IS PART OF THE
STRATEGY.

25:34.705 --> 25:37.121
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO
ALLOW MY SOCIAL GAME TO

25:37.156 --> 25:41.194
GET ME TO WHERE I NEED TO
BE.

25:41.229 --> 25:45.060
BRENT, KYLAND,
DEREK, CHRISTIAN, WELCOME

26:47.675 --> 26:48.814
I'M VERY CHARMING.

26:48.848 --> 26:51.057
SO I'M GOING TO BACK THAT
WITH A SMILE.

26:51.092 --> 26:55.372
AND THEY'LL NEVER SEE IT
COMING.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.236
I'M TOO EXCITED.

26:57.270 --> 26:58.375
OKAY.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.514
HI, GUYS.

26:59.548 --> 27:00.964
ARE YOU READY TO COMPETE?

27:00.998 --> 27:02.482

27:04.623 --> 27:06.590

BRIEFED ON THE RULES.

27:06.625 --> 27:11.491

INCORRECT PLEXIGLASS

27:11.526 --> 27:14.667
PUZZLE INTO THE CORRECT
ONE YOU SEE ON THE EASEL

27:14.702 --> 27:16.186

27:16.220 --> 27:17.843
WIN, AND YOU'LL

27:17.877 --> 27:19.707

YOU'LL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO
BECOME THE FIRST HEAD OF

27:24.781 --> 27:25.367

27:25.402 --> 27:25.782
DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND?

27:26.783 --> 27:28.301
LET'S DO IT.

WAY THEY NEVER EXPECTED.

29:24.486 --> 29:27.041
ALL THAT BEFORE THE FIRST
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD

29:27.075 --> 29:29.595
COMPETITION PLAYS OUT

ALREADY MOVED IN, AND

29:50.719 --> 29:53.653
THEY'RE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING

29:53.688 --> 29:54.585
THE GROUP.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.656

HOUSEGUESTS.

29:56.691 --> 29:57.657

30:04.216 --> 30:08.116
OH, MY GOSH!

30:08.151 --> 30:08.945
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:08.979 --> 30:12.741
IS THIS MINE?

30:12.776 --> 30:13.708
WAIT.

30:13.742 --> 30:15.330
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

30:15.365 --> 30:22.821
MY NAME IS SARAH, AND
I'M A FORENSIC SCIENTIST.

30:22.855 --> 30:26.169
I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
TESTIFYING, SO I KNOW HOW

30:26.203 --> 30:31.277
TO STAY CALM UNDER
PRESSURE.

30:31.312 --> 30:34.073
I LOVE SEWING COSTUMES AND
I CANNOT STOP.

30:34.108 --> 30:37.249
I KNEW FROM A VERY YOUNG
AGE I WANTED TO DRESS UP

30:37.283 --> 30:38.975
AS MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS.

30:39.009 --> 30:42.495
AND SOMEHOW, JUST BECAUSE
I'M A NURSE, I BECAME KIND

30:42.530 --> 30:45.498
OF AN ACCOMPLISHED
SEAMSTRESS, AND I MAKE

30:45.533 --> 30:46.603
CLOTHES ALL OF THE TIME.

30:46.637 --> 30:49.709
I THINK MY PERSONALITY IS
REALLY GOING TO HELP ME ON

30:49.744 --> 30:52.091
"BIG BROTHER" BECAUSE I
DON'T COME OFF AS

30:52.126 --> 30:53.161

30:53.196 --> 30:55.094
I THINK PEOPLE WILL SEE ME
AS SOMEONE WHO IS REALLY

30:55.129 --> 30:56.164
SWEET.

30:56.199 --> 30:58.511
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
LET ME FLY UNDER THE RADAR

30:58.546 --> 31:00.065
UNTIL IT IS WAY TOO LATE.

31:00.099 --> 31:08.832

REALLY LIKE SCHOOL.

DOOGIE HOWSER WAS MY
CHILDHOOD NICKNAME BECAUSE

31:17.289 --> 31:19.394
HE WAS THE YOUNGEST DOCTOR
EVER.

31:19.429 --> 31:22.190
THAT'S THE PATH I'M
WORKING ON.

31:22.225 --> 31:27.230
I GRADUATED SHORTLY AFTER
MY 16th BIRTHDAY, AND

31:27.264 --> 31:30.958
THEN I GRADUATED WITH A
DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL

31:30.992 --> 31:32.649
SCIENCE AT THE TOP OF MY
CLASS.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.237
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

31:34.271 --> 31:38.862
MY MOM IS FROM SOUTH
AFRICA AND MY DAD IS FROM

31:38.897 --> 31:39.898
INDIA.

31:39.932 --> 31:43.694
BEING A BLACK WOMAN AND AN
INDIAN WOMAN MAKES FOR

31:43.729 --> 31:48.113
HAVE AR UNIQUE IDENTITY IN
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

31:48.147 --> 31:52.151

STUDENT, STUDYING FASHION,
I'M NOT TO BE TAKEN

31:54.982 --> 31:55.741
SERIOUSLY.

I WANT TO BE SO EVIL IN
THIS GAME.

I WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE'S
BLOOD UP TO HERE.

AND I'M AN ARTIFICIAL

32:09.686 --> 32:10.929
INTELLIGENCE ENGINEER.

32:10.963 --> 32:14.380
THERE IS BASICALLY NO
WOMEN IN THE FIELD, AND

32:14.415 --> 32:16.762
SOMEONE WILL SAY, ARE YOU
RECEPTIONIST.

32:16.796 --> 32:20.179
NO, NO, NO, I'M ACTUALLY
THE CODER.

PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN AND

32:25.840 --> 32:28.394
HAVE THEM DO YOUR WORK FOR
YOU, BASICALLY.

32:28.429 --> 32:33.123
> I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN
AN ALL-WOMEN'S ALLIANCE.

32:33.158 --> 32:35.367
I WILL COLLECT THE DATA
POINTS OF WHO IS TALKING

32:35.401 --> 32:37.610
TO WHO, WHO IS FLIRTING TO
WHO.

32:37.645 --> 32:40.786
I KNOW IT WILL BE CRUCIAL
TO HAVE VERY STRONG WOMEN

32:40.820 --> 32:43.030
PLAYING WITH ME TO GET TO
THE END.

32:43.064 --> 32:47.551
SO I'M A HUGE FAN OF THIS
GAME, AND I KNOW THAT

32:47.586 --> 32:49.484
SHOWMANCES ARE GOOD FOR
THE GAME.

I HAVE DATED GUYS SIX
INCHES TALLER THAN ME AND

32:54.213 --> 32:56.560
GIRLS WHO ARE A FOOT
SHORTER THAN ME.

32:56.595 --> 32:58.804
IF PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN
USE ME TO THEIR ADVANTAGE,

32:58.838 --> 33:01.013
GO AHEAD, BECAUSE I'M
GOING TO BE DOING THE

33:01.048 --> 33:02.981

33:15.338 --> 33:18.272
I TRAVEL AROUND TO
PEOPLE'S HOMES AND CHECK

33:18.306 --> 33:19.756
THEIR BLOOD.

33:19.790 --> 33:24.243
BEING A SINGLE MOM WILL
DEFINITELY GIVE ME TOOLS

33:24.278 --> 33:26.314
IN THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE
TO HELP ME.

33:26.349 --> 33:30.077
I KNOW HOW TO SEE CRAP, I
CAN SMELL IT A MILE AWAY.

33:30.111 --> 33:33.632
CHRISTIAN, I ASKED YOU TO
TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT.

33:33.666 --> 33:35.254
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
RESPONSIBLE.

33:35.289 --> 33:38.706
EVEN THOUGH I AM 40, I'M
NOT WORRIED ABOUT BEING AN

33:38.740 --> 33:40.742
OLDER PLAYER IN THE GAME.

33:40.777 --> 33:42.434
DO I LOOK OLD TO YOU?

33:42.468 --> 33:45.057
I PLANT TO WIN ALL OF THE

BUILD THEIR TRIANGULAR
HOUSE OF CARDS PUZZLE ON

52:17.720 --> 52:21.034

OTHER THREE TEAMMATES MUST
BALANCE THE PLATFORM WHILE

52:24.831 --> 52:25.763
YOU BUILD IT.

EVERYONE KEEP PLAYING,

54:52.703 --> 54:55.844
DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST
TEAM HERE BECAUSE YOU'LL

54:55.878 --> 55:00.124
BE A HAVE-NOT.

55:00.158 --> 55:04.577
FRENCHIE IS THE NEW
H.O.H., OR THE FIRST

55:04.611 --> 55:05.509
H.O.H.

55:05.543 --> 55:11.480
ALL RIGHT, THE QUEENS ARE
IN SECOND PLACE.

55:11.515 --> 55:12.930

LET'S GO!

55:14.380 --> 55:22.077

FIRST WEEK OF "BIG

55:30.499 --> 55:30.913

55:30.948 --> 55:47.792
I'VE GOT IT.

55:47.827 --> 55:50.968
ACES ARE IN
THIRD PLACE, WHICH MEANS

55:51.002 --> 55:56.249
KINGS, I'M SORRY, YOU ARE
NOW ALL HAVE-NOTs FOR

55:56.283 --> 55:56.698

BUT HIS ENTIRE TEAM IS

57:12.152 --> 57:13.222
SAFE FOR THE WEEK.

57:13.257 --> 57:16.605
HOWEVER, I'M SURE YOU ALL
KNOW OUR MOTTO --

57:16.640 --> 57:18.676
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

57:18.711 --> 57:20.367
CORRECT,

57:20.402 --> 57:22.956
I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD BE A
SUMMER FILLED WITH BIG

57:22.991 --> 57:26.512
RISKS AND BIG REWARDS, AND

57:26.546 --> 57:28.790
OH, MY GOSH!

57:28.824 --> 57:30.274
LISTEN CLOSELY
EVERYONE BECAUSE THINGS

57:30.308 --> 57:32.172

57:39.317 --> 57:41.699
BUT NOT THIS SUMMER.

57:41.734 --> 57:43.011
WHAT?

57:43.045 --> 57:47.705
WE ARE ADDING
A QUARTER OF A MILLION

57:47.740 --> 57:49.362
DOLLARS --

57:49.396 --> 57:51.813
-- TO THE
GRAND PRIZE.

57:51.847 --> 57:52.710
THAT'S RIGHT.

57:52.745 --> 57:56.162
THE WINNER OF "BIG
BROTHER" WILL RECEIVE

57:56.196 --> 57:58.475
$750,000.

57:58.509 --> 58:02.133
SOAK IT IN.

58:02.168 --> 58:05.723
HOWEVER, THERE IS ANOTHER
HUGE REWARD THAT COULD BE

58:05.758 --> 58:08.174
HANDED OUT TONIGHT.

58:08.208 --> 58:10.279
WHAT?

58:10.314 --> 58:12.696
FRENCHIE, I
NEED YOU TO MOVE TO THE

58:12.730 --> 58:16.147
RED DOT BEHIND THE POKER
CHIPS.

58:16.182 --> 58:17.355
FRENCHIE!

58:17.390 --> 58:20.358
OKAY,
FRENCHIE, AS HEAD OF

58:20.393 --> 58:22.982
HOUSEHOLD, I WOULD LIKE TO
MAKE YOU A DOUBLE OR

58:23.016 --> 58:24.052
NOTHING OFFER.

58:24.086 --> 58:30.817
AS YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW YOU
AND YOUR ENTIRE TEAM ARE

58:30.852 --> 58:34.614
SAFE FOR THE WEEK, BUT HOW
DOES TWO WEEKS OF SAFETY

58:34.649 --> 58:36.616
FOR YOU AND YOUR WHOLE
TEAM SOUND?

58:36.651 --> 58:41.069
DO WE KEEP THE ONE NO
MATTER WHAT?

58:41.103 --> 58:42.829
I DON'T WANT

58:42.864 --> 58:44.175
YOUR ANSWER JUST YET.

58:44.210 --> 58:47.075
I NEED TO TELL YOU HOW
THIS WORKS.

58:47.109 --> 58:51.735
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET
A SECOND WEEK OF SAFETY IS

58:51.769 --> 58:56.463
LAND THOSE TWO OVERSIZED
DICE ON THAT TABLE IN

58:56.498 --> 59:02.400
FRONT OF YOU, AND I'LL
GIVE YOU 45 SECONDS TO DO

59:02.435 --> 59:03.470
IT.

59:03.505 --> 59:08.234
NOW, ONCE A DYE IS SAFELY
ON THE TABLE, IT IS GOOD

59:08.268 --> 59:10.892
AS LONG AS IT STAYS ON THE
TABLE.

59:10.926 --> 59:14.481
IF YOU SUCCEED, YOU'RE
H.O.H. THIS WEEK, AND YOUR

59:14.516 --> 59:16.138
TEAM IS SAFE.

59:16.173 --> 59:19.314
NEXT WEEK WE WILL CROWN A
NEW H.O.H., BUT YOU AND

59:19.348 --> 59:21.558
YOUR ENTIRE TEAM WILL BE
SAFE THAT WEEK AS WELL.

59:21.592 --> 59:24.733
HOWEVER, IF YOU TAKE THE
OFFER AND FAIL, THEN YOU

59:24.768 --> 59:26.908
ARE NO LONGER H.O.H.

59:26.942 --> 59:31.844
AND YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE
TEAM CAN BE NOMINATED THIS

59:31.878 --> 59:32.879
WEEK.

59:32.914 --> 59:37.643
IF THIS HAPPENS, CLAIRE,
AS THE SECOND-PLACE TEAM

59:37.677 --> 59:40.680
CAPTAIN, YOU WOULD BECOME
H.O.H., AND YOUR TEAM

59:40.715 --> 59:42.440
WOULD BE SAFE FOR THE
WEEK.

59:42.475 --> 59:44.477
FRENCHIE, I WANT TO GIVE
YOU SOME TIME TO THINK

59:44.511 --> 59:45.512
ABOUT IT.

59:45.547 --> 59:48.999
YOU'VE ALREADY WON TWO
COMPETITIONS TONIGHT, ALL

59:49.033 --> 59:52.727
RIGHT, SO THINK IT OVER
WHILE WE GO TO BREAK.

59:52.761 --> 59:56.006
ASK YOURSELF IF YOU'RE
FEELING LUCKY FOR A THIRD

59:56.040 --> 59:57.007
TIME.

59:57.041 --> 59:58.595
