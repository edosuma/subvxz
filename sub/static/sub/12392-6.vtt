WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.160
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
IT'S DOWN THERE?

00:04.200 --> 00:06.134
I CAN FEEL IT
IN MY BONES, GUS.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.638
ALL GREAT OIL WILDCATI'ERS
HAVE THAT ABILITY.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.332
ME, GE'ITY,

00:11.370 --> 00:13.179
CLAMPE'I'I', CRISCO,

00:13.210 --> 00:15.201
AND WESSON.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.605
BUT YOUR DAD TOLD US
NEVER TO DIG IN THE YARD.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.345
MY DAD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE CONCEPT

00:18.380 --> 00:21.042
OF TAKING RISKS.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.480
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIND
THE OIL, AND THAT'LL SHOW HIM.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.548
OKAY.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.787
LET'S SAY WE DO FIND OIL.
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

00:30.830 --> 00:32.559
ALL OF OUR DREAMS
COME TRUE.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.420
I'LL BE RICH,
AND YOU'LL WORK FOR ME.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.075
HEY, HEY!

00:52.120 --> 00:54.315
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

00:54.350 --> 00:55.419
HEY, DAD.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.441
WE WERE PROSPECT ING
FOR OIL.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.479
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

00:58.520 --> 01:00.556
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

01:00.590 --> 01:02.649
THERE'S GRASS SEED
AND DUCT TAPE IN THE GARAGE.

01:02.690 --> 01:05.124
I WANT THIS YARD
EXACTLY AS IT WAS.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.492
I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES YOU
BOTH ALL NIGHT, YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:07.530 --> 01:09.293
AH!

01:12.140 --> 01:15.132
[Shawn and Gus cry]

01:19.180 --> 01:20.807
(Hicks)
YOU'RE BUNCHING UP OVER THERE!

01:20.840 --> 01:23.445
LET'S GO!
MOVE THAT PIPE. LET'S GO!

01:23.480 --> 01:25.641
ALL RIGHT, MCAULIFFE, BRING
THOSE FORKS IN THROUGH HERE.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.148
WATCH IT NOW.
WATCH 'EM.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.784
EASY ON THE TONGS.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.344
RUFUS! RUFUS!

01:31.390 --> 01:32.357
EASY ON THE TONGS.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.814
DON'T BREAK THOSE CHAINS!

01:35.860 --> 01:37.623
YOU TWO ARE BUNCHING UP

01:37.660 --> 01:38.752
OVER THERE.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.326
LET'S MOVE THAT PIPE.
LET'S GO!

01:42.370 --> 01:44.122
HEY! HEY!

01:44.170 --> 01:46.138
MCCLOU D,
WATCH THAT LIFI'.

01:46.170 --> 01:49.207
CHECK YOUR LINE,
ALDRIDGE.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.207
HEY, YOU!

01:50.240 --> 01:51.434
YOU!

01:51.470 --> 01:54.109
THAT'S NO MAN'S LAND.
GET AWAY FROM THERE!

01:55.210 --> 01:56.279
HEY, BUDDY!

01:56.310 --> 01:57.709
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.342
CLEAR THE AREA.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.838
DON'T THINK
I'M NOT GONNA WRITE YOU UP.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.509
GAAH !

02:08.560 --> 02:12.724
[men shouting]

02:12.760 --> 02:14.250
[thunder rumbles]

02:31.450 --> 02:32.712
GREAT, I'M MISSING
A HUGE SYMPOSIUM

02:32.750 --> 02:34.240
ON NEW FRONTIERS
IN MEDICAL TREATMENT,

02:34.280 --> 02:35.542
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT FOR.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.411
WHAT IS THAT?
THE FUNGUS ONE?

02:37.450 --> 02:38.781
YEAH.

02:38.820 --> 02:39.752
DON'T PLAY, SHAWN.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.553
YOU KNOW THAT FUNGUS
IS MY BREAD AND BUTTER.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.184
REALLY? YOU KNOW WHAT MY BREAD
AND BUTI'ER IS?

02:44.230 --> 02:45.128
BREAD AND BUTTER.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.492
FUNGUS HAS NEVER ENTERED
INTO THE EQUATION.

02:47.530 --> 02:48.827
NOT ONCE.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.260
ALL THE CHIEF SAID WAS
THAT TIME WAS OF THE ESSENCE

02:51.300 --> 02:52.460
AND THAT SHE'D BRIEF US
ON THE BOAT.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.593
I WONDER
WHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.232
IT OBVIOUSLY HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE OCEAN.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.703
OH, GUS, IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.900
CRAB ON CRAB VIOLENCE,

02:58.940 --> 03:02.341
A GANG WAR BETWEEN THE MERMEN
AND THE SHARK PEOPLE,

03:02.380 --> 03:04.940
OR MAYBE SHE WANTS TO TAKE US
WILD ORCA HUNTING.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.413
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
COME ON UP.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.445
ALL RIGHT, HEY,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.310
A SAFETY INSPECTOR
NAMED BUTCH HICKS

03:12.360 --> 03:14.248
FELL TO HIS DEATH
FROM AN OFFSHORE OIL RIG

03:14.290 --> 03:15.257
LAST NIGHT,

03:15.290 --> 03:17.258
AND HIS BODY WASHED UP ONSHORE.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.780
THE RIG HE WAS WORKING ON
IS THE BAMFORD NUMBER SEVEN.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.220
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
LET ME JUST SAY,

03:22.270 --> 03:24.465
AWESOME, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO ON AN OIL RIG.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.467
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF,

03:25.500 --> 03:27.365
BUT HOW IS THIS
A POLICE MATTER?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.709
FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID,
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

03:29.740 --> 03:30.934
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THE COAST GUARD THINKS,

03:30.970 --> 03:31.959
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.433
WE RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS TIP
ABOUT A WEEK AGO

03:34.480 --> 03:35.538
THAT WE TRACED
TO A PAY PHONE

03:35.580 --> 03:37.241
OUTSIDE THE DIVE SHOP
ON THE PIER.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.645
THE CALLER SAID

03:38.680 --> 03:40.011
THAT SOMETHING HIGHLY UNSAFE
WAS GOING ON

03:40.050 --> 03:41.017
OUT ON THAT RIG

03:41.050 --> 03:42.938
AND THAT HE WAS RISKING
EVERYTHING TO WARN US.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.742
DUDE, HARBOR SEAL.
WHAT?

03:44.790 --> 03:46.417
DID YOU SHARE THIS INFORMATION

03:46.460 --> 03:48.314
ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS TIP
WITH THE COAST GUARD?

03:48.360 --> 03:50.328
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.520
I'VE HAD DEALINGS WITH THEM
IN THE PAST,

03:51.560 --> 03:52.595
AND I DON'T TRUST 'EM.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.598
WELL, IF YOU SUSPECT
FOUL PLAY,

03:55.630 --> 03:56.597
SHOULDN'T YOUR LEAD DETECTIVE
BE HERE?

03:56.630 --> 03:57.699
I MEAN,
WHERE'S LASSIE?

03:57.730 --> 03:59.766
AND JULIET?
SHOULDN'T SHE BE HERE?

03:59.800 --> 04:00.937
OKAY, WELL, THE TRUTH IS,

04:00.970 --> 04:03.700
UM, WHAT WE'RE DOING
ISN'T EXACT --

04:03.740 --> 04:07.039
WE'RE ACTING MORE
IN AN UNOFFICIAL CAPACITY,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.206
AND ANY MORE QUESTIONS,

04:08.240 --> 04:09.605
AND I'M GONNA TURN THIS BOAT
AROUND AND TAKE YOU BOTH

04:09.650 --> 04:10.605
BACK TO SHORE, UNDERSTOOD?

04:10.650 --> 04:11.799
I'M ALL RIGHT WITH THAT.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.010
EXCEPT THAT GUS'S LEG
IS TOUCHING MINE.

04:13.050 --> 04:15.416
IS NOT.
HE KEEPS LOOKING AT MY EAR.

04:15.450 --> 04:16.815
ENOUGH. NOW WE'RE GONNA BE THERE
IN ABOUT FIVE--

04:16.850 --> 04:18.681
[siren blaring]

04:18.720 --> 04:21.382
[woman over bullhorn]
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES
COAST GUARD.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.978
STOP YOUR ENGINE
AND PREPARE TO BE BOARDED.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.452
OH, DAMN IT.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.595
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

04:34.740 --> 04:35.832
GOOD MORNING.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.030
HEY.
GOOD MORNING.

04:37.070 --> 04:37.900
WHAT BRINGS YOU
OUT HERE, CHIEF?

04:37.940 --> 04:39.771
OH, JUST DOING
A LITTLE SIGHT-SEEING.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.437
YEAH, IS THAT RIGHT?
WHAT'S THIS?

04:41.480 --> 04:42.640
OH, IT'S A RIG MANIFEST.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.999
YOU WOULDN'T BE THINKING
OF NOSING IN

04:44.050 --> 04:45.870
ON MY ACCIDENTAL DEATH CASE,
NOW WOULD YOU?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.411
CAUSE THAT'S MY JURISDICTION.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.589
OH, WELL, SORRY TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, COMMANDER,

04:49.620 --> 04:51.417
BUT ACCORDING TO THE GPS,

04:51.450 --> 04:52.678
THAT SOUTH EAST CORNER
OF THE RIG

04:52.720 --> 04:55.382
CROSSES BACK
INSIDE THREE MILES,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.422
WHICH BRINGS IT
UNDER MY JURISDICTION.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.722
OH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME UP AGAINST ME

04:58.760 --> 04:59.920
BECAUSE YOU WILL LOSE.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.053
OH, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.499
[chuckles]

05:03.530 --> 05:04.497
HI, COMMANDER,

05:04.530 --> 05:05.724
I'M SHAWN SPENCER,

05:05.770 --> 05:07.499
AMATEUR DOLPHINOLOGIST,
BIG FAN OF THE BRINY

05:07.540 --> 05:08.632
AND LEMON SQUARES.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.638
STAY OUT OF THIS,
MR. SPENCER.

05:10.670 --> 05:11.637
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.

05:11.670 --> 05:12.568
I'M SURE THE COMMANDER HERE

05:12.610 --> 05:13.838
IS A PERFECT LY REASONABLE
HUMAN PERSON, HUH?

05:13.880 --> 05:14.835
HERE'S THE THING.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.802
WE RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS TIP

05:16.850 --> 05:19.671
THAT THERE MAY BE MORE GOING ON
HERE THAN MEETS THE EYE.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.449
SO WITH YOUR BLESSING,
OF COURSE,

05:21.480 --> 05:23.345
WE'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD
AND CHECK OUT THE RIG.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.345
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:24.390 --> 05:25.709
ANONYMOUS TIP?

05:25.750 --> 05:27.456
YOU WEREN'T GONNA SHARE
THIS INFORMATION WITH ME?

05:27.490 --> 05:29.481
LIKE YOU EVER SHARED
ANYTHING WITH ME.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.020
I COULD HAVE YOU
BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.994
YOU CAN'T INTIMIDATE ME.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.349
I'M GIVING YOU
EXACTLY TEN SECONDS

05:34.400 --> 05:36.027
TO GET THIS VESSEL
OUT OF MY WATERS.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.721
HA! I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU MAKE ME.
(Commander)
OH, YEAH?

05:37.770 --> 05:38.896
(Vick)
OH, YEAH.

05:38.930 --> 05:40.033
OH, LOOK, MY NOSE IS TOUCHING
YOUR NOSE.

05:40.070 --> 05:40.832
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

05:40.870 --> 05:42.599
CAN YOU DO THAT
TO A COMMANDER?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.631
YOU CAN
WHEN SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.376
(Vick)
DON'T YOU PUT YOUR NOSE

05:46.410 --> 05:47.377
RIGHT UP INTO MY NOSE
AGAIN.

05:47.410 --> 05:48.274
WHAT IF I PUT IT
REALLY CLOSE?

05:48.310 --> 05:50.005
WHAT IF I ACTUALLY TOUCH
YOUR NOSE?

YES, SIR.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.964
I UNDERSTAND.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.001
JUDGE RULED WITH ME
ON JURISDICTION, DIDN'T HE?

06:20.040 --> 06:21.007
YEAH.
HA.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.132
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT

06:22.180 --> 06:24.944
THAT I HAVE FAR MORE EXPERIENCE
INVESTIGATING HOMICIDES.

06:24.980 --> 06:25.947
THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT THIS WASN'T A HOMICIDE.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.015
THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.472
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR CERTAIN.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.589
I DO KNOW THAT
FOR CERTAIN.

06:29.620 --> 06:30.439
(Gus)
I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.117
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
THE CHIEF NEVER SAID

06:32.150 --> 06:33.117
SHE HAD A SISTER.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.559
IT'S STRANGE.

06:34.590 --> 06:35.579
AND SUCH AN ALLURING SISTER
AT THAT.

WELL, TOO BAD

07:13.100 --> 07:15.660
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PSYCHIC,
MR. SPENCER,

07:15.700 --> 07:18.498
WHO IS GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO OUR ANONYMOUS TIPSTER IS,

IMPORTANT TO THE INVESTIGATION.

DON'T BE LATE.

ALL RIGHT, CHIEF,
I ONLY SAID YES SO THAT WE--

08:00.080 --> 08:02.002
YOU DON'T OWE ME
AN EXPLANATION.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.838
YOU JUST DO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.245
[door slams]

08:06.280 --> 08:07.747
IS IT JUST ME,
OR DOES SHE SEEM PEEVED?

08:17.590 --> 08:18.784
(Gus)
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

08:18.830 --> 08:20.821
SO MUCH FOR US BEING
IN CHIEF VICK'S GOOD GRACES.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.259
WE MAY HAVE JUST BURNED
OUR BRIDGE WITH HER.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.165
GUS, DON'T BE
A MYOPIC CHIHUAHUA.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.191
I HAVE A FOOLPROOF PLAN
THAT NOT ONLY SOLVES THE CASE,

08:26.230 --> 08:27.299
BUT GIVES THE CHIEF
ALL THE CREDIT.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.295
WHAT IS IT?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.637
ACTUALLY, ALL I HAVE
IS THE PHRASE,

08:29.670 --> 08:30.637
"I HAVE A FOOLPROOF PLAN."

08:30.670 --> 08:32.809
BEYOND THAT,
I'M WIDE OPEN.

08:38.050 --> 08:39.711
WE RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

08:39.750 --> 08:41.172
ABOUT A WEEK AGO
THAT WE TRACED TO A PAY PHONE

08:41.220 --> 08:42.209
OUTSIDE THE DIVE SHOP
ON THE PIER.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.218
OKAY, RESEARCH TIME.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.912
GIVE ME EVERYTHING YOU GOT
ON OFFSHORE OIL RIGS.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.110
ALL RIGHT, GENERALLY,
OIL PLATFORMS ARE LOCATED

08:49.160 --> 08:50.149
ON A CONTINENTAL SHELF.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.157
SHELF. GOT IT.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.999
A TYPICAL PLATFORM HAS
AROUND 3O WELL HEADS.

08:53.030 --> 08:53.792
30, CHECK.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.092
DRILLING CONTINUES
24 HOURS A DAY

08:55.130 --> 08:56.097
AND THERE ARE TWO CREWS
ON BOARD

08:56.130 --> 08:57.597
AT ALL TIMES--

08:57.630 --> 08:59.097
ONE FOR THE DAY SHIFT
AND ONE FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.928
"LOVE BROKERS."

09:01.970 --> 09:03.733
NIGHT SHIFT.
COME ON, DUDE.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.806
YOU GOT THE FONZ
PLAYING AGAINST TYPE.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.104
WHERE IS THIS BOAT?

09:08.140 --> 09:10.142
(Shawn)
EXCUSE US.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.272
IS THIS WHERE THE COAST GUARD
BOAT LAUNCHES FROM?

09:11.310 --> 09:13.312
ARE YOU SHAWN SPENCER?
I AM INDEED.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.716
COMMANDER DUNLAP INSTRUCTED ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

09:20.020 --> 09:23.729
"GENTLEMEN, YOUR JOB IS
TO STAY PUT AND DO NOTHING."

09:25.290 --> 09:26.655
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.099
SHE GOES THROUGH ALL THE TROUBLE
TO HIRE US

09:28.130 --> 09:29.825
AND THEN LEAVE US BEHIND?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.019
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, GUS?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.594
WE ARE MERELY PAWNS

09:32.640 --> 09:34.369
IN A BITTER SIBLING FEUD.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.936
I'M NOBODY'S PAWN,
SHAWN.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.632
I'M A QUEEN.

09:38.670 --> 09:40.900
AT LEAST I CAN MAKE
MY CONFERENCE ON FOOT FUNGUS.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.202
NO, NO, NO,
WE CANNOT QUIT.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.003
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT QUITTERS.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.006
AND BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THIS
FOR THE CHIEF, REMEMBER?

09:46.050 --> 09:47.210
WE'VE GOTTA GET
ON THAT RIG.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.239
YEAH, BUT HOW?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.714
(man)
HAVE A GOOD TRIP,
MR. BAMFORD.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.381
THE RIG HE WAS WORKING ON
IS THE BAMFORD NUMBER SEVEN,

09:58.430 --> 09:59.658
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.326
I HAVE AN IDEA.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.634
BUT WE'LL NEED
COOL NAMES.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.179
SO, MR. TURNER--

10:13.210 --> 10:14.837
PLEASE, CALL ME T-BONE.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.144
OKAY, T-BONE,
HAVE YOU TWO INVESTED

10:17.180 --> 10:17.942
IN OFFSHORE DRILLING BEFORE?

10:17.980 --> 10:20.073
[chuckles]
HAVE WE...YES, LORDY, YES.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.714
SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY?

10:22.750 --> 10:24.980
I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.282
YOU GOT YOUR BASIC RIG
WITH 30 WARHEADS,

10:26.320 --> 10:27.958
SITTING ON THE CONTINENTAL
COUNTERTOP,

10:27.990 --> 10:29.150
RUNNING 24 CREWS

10:29.190 --> 10:31.181
DAY AND NIGHT
EVERY TWO HOURS.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.050
THAT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.318
THE TRUTH IS, NO,
WE'RE NOT THAT SOPHISTICATED

10:35.360 --> 10:37.191
IN THE OIL BUSINESS.

10:37.230 --> 10:38.026
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.890
LOOK, MY FATHER AND I
DON'T APPRECIATE

10:39.940 --> 10:41.191
OUR TIME BEING WASTED.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.333
YOU'LL HAVE TO PARDON
MY DAUGHTER, GENTLEMEN.

10:43.370 --> 10:45.167
APPARENTLY, YALE UNIVERSITY
DIDN'T TEACH HER ANY MANNERS--

10:45.210 --> 10:47.269
OR HOW TO GET A HUSBAND.

10:47.310 --> 10:48.675
HONEY,

10:48.710 --> 10:50.268
RUN DOWN THERE
INTO THE GALLEY

10:50.310 --> 10:52.346
AND MIX US UP
SOME COCKTAILS

10:52.380 --> 10:54.416
WHILE THE MEN TALK.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.417
SURE.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.111
[chuckles]

10:57.150 --> 11:00.381
WOW, NOT TO BE RUDE,
BILLY JOE,

11:00.420 --> 11:02.183
BUT IT'S THE let CENTURY,

11:02.220 --> 11:03.289
AND WOMEN HAVE ACTUALLY EARNED
THE RIGHT

11:03.330 --> 11:04.319
TO BE TREATED EQUALLY.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.021
CUT THE CRAP, SON.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.756
BLIND MEN COULD SEE
THAT YOU TWO AREN'T INVESTORS.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.859
TECHNICALLY, A BLIND MAN
CAN'T SEE ANYTHING, BILLY JOE.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.299
I OFFERED YOU A RIDE
OUT HERE

11:12.330 --> 11:14.230
SO I COULD TAKE A LOOK
AT YOU,

11:14.270 --> 11:16.295
FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO.

11:16.340 --> 11:18.308
WHAT ARE YOU?
GOVERNMENT WATCHDOGS?

11:18.340 --> 11:19.705
EPA?

11:19.740 --> 11:21.401
IS THIS
ABOUT THAT LITTLE OIL SPILL?

11:21.440 --> 11:23.408
YOU HAD
A OIL SPILL OUT HERE?

11:25.380 --> 11:26.404
NO.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.474
THE TRUTH, BILLY JOE,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.112
IS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.186
WE'RE WORKING
FOR THE COAST GUARD.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.289
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.288
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
CHESTERFIELD MCMILLAN, AND WIFE.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.288
WE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE DEATH

11:36.320 --> 11:37.958
OF YOUR SAFETY INSPECTOR,
BUTCH HICKS,

11:37.990 --> 11:39.184
AND WHETHER OR NOT

11:39.230 --> 11:40.959
IT WAS TRULY
AN ACCIDENT.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.322
BUT WE WERE RUNNING LATE, SO WE
MISSED THE BOAT RIDE OUT HERE.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.498
AS MUCH AS I DON'T APPRECIATE
BEING LIED TO,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.189
IF YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT HICKS'S DEATH

11:49.240 --> 11:50.366
NOT BEING AN ACCIDENT,

11:50.410 --> 11:53.038
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.229
WHAT CAN I DO
TO HELP YOU?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.009
WELL, FIRST THING
WE'LL NEED TO SEE

11:56.040 --> 11:57.348
IS MR. HICKS'S PERSONAL EFFECTS.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.245
AND I WILL BE NEEDING

11:59.280 --> 12:01.214
A LITTLE BABY UMBRELLA

12:01.250 --> 12:02.239
IN MY MAI TAI.

12:08.790 --> 12:09.984
(Lassiter)
SO WHAT'S OUR MISSING PERSON'S
NAME AGAIN?

12:10.030 --> 12:11.520
DR. CHRISTOPHER RENAUD.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.391
HE'S A PROFESSOR
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

12:13.430 --> 12:14.351
AND LAST SEEN?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.027
HIS 3:00 LECTURE
ON THURSDAY.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.391
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE GONNA NEED

12:17.430 --> 12:19.364
A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE
IN ATTENDANCE THAT DAY.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.288
I'VE ALREADY OBTAINED A LIST
FROM THE T.A.,

12:21.340 --> 12:22.159
AND I'VE SET UP INTERVIEWS

12:22.200 --> 12:24.031
WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF HIS STUDENTS.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.401
OH.
GOOD WORK, O'HARA.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.374
OH, ONE MORE THING.
SHOOT.

12:27.410 --> 12:31.278
I AM THINKING OF ASKING OUT
COMMANDER DUNLAP ON A DATE.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.449
YOUR THOUGHTS.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.879
UH.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.242
WELL, UH, I THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA, CARLTON.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.212
REALLY?
WHY?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.354
UM, WELL,
FOR STARTERS,

12:43.390 --> 12:46.382
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S THE CHIEF'S SISTER.

12:46.430 --> 12:47.556
NOT TO MENTION,
THEY DON'T GET ALONG.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.397
I MEAN, YOU SAW THE WAY THEY
WERE SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER.

12:49.430 --> 12:51.398
SEE IT?
I DEVOURED IT.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.569
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.068
THAT BARBARA, SHE'S
A REAL SNAP PEA, ISN'T SHE?

12:56.100 --> 12:57.306
MM.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.433
SHE'S GOT
THAT GREAT STURDY BUILD.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.404
YEAH.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.874
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE FOCUS
ON INTERVIEWING OUR WITNESSES

13:03.910 --> 13:05.275
FOR THE MISSING PERSONS CASE,
HUH?

13:05.310 --> 13:07.175
MM. ABSOLUTELY.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.313
YEAH, FORGETI EVEN MENTIONED
THAT OTHER THING.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.489
I WILL.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.959
WELL, THERE WAS
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

13:20.000 --> 13:23.094
THAT SOMETHING UNSAFE
WAS GOING ON OUT HERE.

13:23.130 --> 13:25.291
ANY CLUE AS TO WHAT THE CALLER
MIGHT HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO?

13:25.330 --> 13:26.490
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.498
THIS PLACE IS RUN
STRICTLY BY THE BOOK.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.360
BUTCH HICKS MADE SURE
OF THAT,

13:30.410 --> 13:31.468
AND SO DO I.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.171
YOU CAN ASK ANYBODY.

13:33.210 --> 13:37.078
MY PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION
IS BASED ON SAFETY.

13:37.110 --> 13:39.203
WATCH YOUR HEAD
GOING IN HERE NOW.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.343
SOMEBODY PUT A RAIL
ON THIS SIDE OF THIS LADDER.

13:41.380 --> 13:44.349
THAT'S A VIOLATION.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.381
WELL, HERE'S HICKS'S OFFICE.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.957
LET'S SEE.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.584
WHAT'S IN HERE?

13:52.630 --> 13:54.450
THAT'S THE GEOLOGIST'S LAB.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.459
[chuckles]
MY DAUGHTER'S TRYING TO GET ME
ALL HIGH-TECH.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.196
SHE THINKS BECAUSE I PUNCHED
A FEW DRY HOLES

14:01.240 --> 14:03.128
THAT I'VE LOST MY TOUCH,

14:03.170 --> 14:06.003
AND SHE TALKED ME INTO HIRING
THIS FANCY ROCK DOCTOR.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.905
SHOWING ME WHERE TO DIG.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.249
I DON'T NEED NOBODY
TO TELL ME WHERE TO DIG.

14:10.280 --> 14:14.569
ONCE THIS WELL COMES IN
LIKE I KNOW IT'S GOING TO,

14:14.620 --> 14:16.247
I'M GONNA BE BACK
ON TOP AGAIN.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.441
WELL, YOU GUYS TAKE
YOUR TIME.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.549
IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE TOPSIDE.

14:20.590 --> 14:23.388
IF YOU NEED US,
WE'LL BE BOTTOMS-UP.

14:26.390 --> 14:27.493
SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

14:27.530 --> 14:30.522
(Shawn)
ANYTHING THAT WILL HELP US
FIGURE OUT

14:30.570 --> 14:31.264
WHO THE ANONYMOUS TIPSTER WAS.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.564
OR A KIT KAT.
I'M STARVING.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.034
SINCE HICKS WAS IN CHARGE
OF SAFETY ON THE RIG,

14:36.070 --> 14:39.039
IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THE TIPSTER
MAY HAVE COME TO HIM FIRST.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.971
I HAVE THIS BIG STACK
OF SAFETY VIOLATION REPORTS.

14:42.010 --> 14:44.649
MAN, THIS GUY HICKS
WAS A REAL STICKLER.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.569
IF BY STICKLER, YOU MEAN A GUY
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY SNACKS,

14:47.620 --> 14:49.440
THEN YEAH,
I AGREE WITH THAT.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.609
(Dunlap)
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.927
NOT EATING CAN DY,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.554
MY ORDERS FOR YOU
WERE TO STAY PUT AND DO NOTHING.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.420
REALLY?
THAT WASN'T REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY?

15:04.470 --> 15:05.494
OUT.

15:05.530 --> 15:09.466
WAIT.
I WAS DRAWN TO THIS OFFICE.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.639
WITH VERY POWERFUL
PSYCHIC VISIONS

15:11.670 --> 15:13.308
OF A MAN IN SCUBA GEAR

15:13.340 --> 15:15.376
WITH A SALAMANDER
IN HIS WETSUIT.

15:15.410 --> 15:16.479
WELL, THANK YOU,
MR. SPENCER,

15:16.510 --> 15:18.239
BUT I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT'S HELPFUL.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.247
OR HEALTHY.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.214
WAIT, I'M SEEING MORE.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.717
THE ANONYMOUS TIPSTER.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.388
I CAN TELL YOU
WHERE HE IS.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.513
REALLY?
AND WHERE'S THAT?

15:26.550 --> 15:31.988
THE MORGUE.

15:32.030 --> 15:33.224
COMMANDER, LOOK, MY MYRIAD
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE SKILLS

15:33.260 --> 15:35.728
ASSURE ME
THAT THE ANONYMOUS TIPSTER

15:35.760 --> 15:37.990
IS SAFETY INSPECTOR
BUTCH HICKS.

15:38.030 --> 15:40.692
YOUR PSYCHIC DETECTIVE SKILLS?

15:40.740 --> 15:41.695
YOU LEFT OUT MYRIAD.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.037
RIGHT.
WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.105
I SEE A SECURITY CAMERA

15:44.140 --> 15:45.562
IN FRONT OF THE DIVE SHOP.

15:45.610 --> 15:48.238
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS REVIEW LAST FRIDAY'S TAPE

15:48.280 --> 15:48.974
AND YOU'LL SEE
THAT I'M RIGHT.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.705
FINE.
LET'S SAY YOU ARE RIGHT.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.978
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.318
ALL THE EVIDENCE
STILL POINTS

15:53.350 --> 15:54.578
TO HIS DEATH BEING
AN ACCIDENT.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.609
LET'S GO.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.312
AS LONG AS I'M IN CHARGE
OF THIS CASE,

15:59.350 --> 16:01.386
YOU WILL FOLLOW MY ORDERS
TO THE LETTER.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.627
MY ORDERS ARE
THAT YOU GET OFF THIS RIG.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.287
WE HAVE A SHUTTLE LEAVING
IN AN HOUR.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.649
YOU WILL BE ON IT.

16:09.330 --> 16:12.060
IS IT JUST ME,
OR IS THAT WOMAN A TINGE BOSSY?

16:12.100 --> 16:13.397
SHE SCARES ME.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.236
LET'S HOP TO IT.

16:14.270 --> 16:15.532
WE HAVE LESS THAN AN HOUR
TO INTERVIEW

16:15.570 --> 16:16.730
EVERY WORKER
ON THE NIGHT SHIFT.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.203
NO, SHAWN,
LET'S DISCUSS SOMETHING

16:18.240 --> 16:19.605
THAT WON'T GET US
INTO TROUBLE.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.437
LIKE WHERE WE'RE GONNA EAT
WHEN WE GET BACK TO SHORE.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.300
ALL THAT KIT KAT TALK
MADE ME HUNGRY.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.749
DUDE, THIS MAY BE
THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE

16:24.780 --> 16:26.441
TO WEED OUT WHO MIGHT HAVE
WANTED TO KILL HICKS.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.313
IF THE COMMANDER FINDS US,
SHE'S GONNA GO APE--

16:31.690 --> 16:33.009
DO I SMELL MEATLOAF?

16:33.060 --> 16:35.779
AND FRESH APPLE COBBLER,
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.050
I GUESS IT WON'T HURT
TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.234
WELL, HELLO,
MISS ASHLEY.

16:47.270 --> 16:51.229
WOULD YOU KINDLY DIRECT
MY BUDDY AND I

16:51.270 --> 16:52.601
TO THE CHUCK WAGON,
PLEASE?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.278
I'M SORRY?

16:54.310 --> 16:55.777
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHERE THE MESS HALL IS.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.300
IT'S TWO DECKS DOWN.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.649
AWESOME. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH US?

17:00.680 --> 17:04.639
PERHAPS, AFTERWARDS, YOU COULD
GIVE US A LITTLE TOUR?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.612
LOOK, REGARDLESS OF HOW
MY FATHER TREATS ME,

17:06.650 --> 17:10.279
I'M NOT THE CRUISE DIRECTOR
HERE.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.059
(Shawn)
SO TELL ME
ABOUT THE SAFETY INSPECTOR.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.193
THAT GUY WAS

17:13.230 --> 17:15.255
ALWAYS WRITING ME UP
FOR THE SMALLEST INFRACT ION.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.289
I HATE TO SAY IT,

17:16.330 --> 17:17.422
BUT I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.261
THERE'S NO DAIRY IN THAT,
IS THERE?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.460
YOU KNOW,
I HAD A DREAM

17:22.500 --> 17:25.298
THAT I KNIFED HIM
IN HIS SLEEP.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.329
BUT I WOKE UP.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.607
HICKS SHOULD HAVE NEVER GONE

17:28.640 --> 17:29.607
INTO NO MAN'S LAND.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.800
NO MAN'S LAND?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.408
IT'S THE AREA

17:32.450 --> 17:33.474
THAT'S STRICTLY OFF-LIMITS
DURING CRANE OPERATION.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.270
HICKS SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.675
I MEAN,
HE WAS A SAFETY INSPECTOR.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.314
ANYWAY, IT'S A SHAME IF SOMEONE
LOOSENED THAT TACKLE

17:39.350 --> 17:40.612
AND KILLED HIM.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.457
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON

17:42.490 --> 17:44.128
TO SHOW ANY SYMPATHY
FOR HICKS.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.128
WHAT?

17:46.160 --> 17:50.119
[laughs]
NO, I'M SAYING IF IT WAS ME,
I WOULD HAVE USED A GUN.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.493
THIS PLACE IS LOUSY
WITH SUSPECT S.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.304
AND EXCESSIVELY
HEAW FOOD.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.377
I THINK I ATE MY WEIGHT IN THAT
COWBOY CHICKEN CASSEROLE.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.570
MAN, THIS FOOD
WAS DISGUSTING.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.475
ALL I HAD
WAS A HALF A BRAN MUFFIN.

18:03.510 --> 18:04.875
WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

18:04.910 --> 18:07.549
WELL, I THINK WE NEED
TO GET INTO HICKS'S HOUSE.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.445
IF THERE REALLY WAS
A CONSPIRACY TO KILL HIM,

18:09.480 --> 18:11.289
WE'RE GONNA NEED
HARD EVIDENCE.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.356
WHEN WE GET BACK TO SHORE,
WE GO SEE CHIEF VICK.

18:13.390 --> 18:16.689
WELL, FIRST WE GO HOME,
CHANGE INTO OUR JAMMIES,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.426
TAKE A NAP,
THEN WE WAKE UP,

18:18.460 --> 18:19.882
HAVE SOME JUICE.

18:19.930 --> 18:23.422
THEN STRAIGHT TO VICK.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.425
ALL RIGHT, WELL, CALL ME

18:24.470 --> 18:26.392
IF ANYONE MATCHING
THAT DESCRIPTION SHOWS UP.

18:26.430 --> 18:27.738
THAN KS.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.567
HEY, JULES.
CHIEF IN HER OFFICE?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.669
LADIES ROOM.
DARN.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.132
GUS AND I REALLY NEED
TO SPEAK TO HER.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.376
THINK YOU CAN GIVE US
A NUMERAL

18:33.410 --> 18:34.672
SO WE CAN GAUGE
JUST HOW LONG SHE'LL BE?

18:34.710 --> 18:36.871
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
FIVE, SEVEN MINUTES MAYBE.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.400
HOW ABOUT
NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO?

18:38.450 --> 18:39.405
I HAVE NO IDEA,
SHAWN.

18:39.450 --> 18:41.509
AND NO, I AM NOT GONNA GO
TO THE LADIES ROOM

18:41.550 --> 18:42.517
AND CHECK ON HER
FOR YOU.

18:42.550 --> 18:43.619
IS THIS YOUR MISSING PERSON?

18:43.650 --> 18:44.685
(Juliet)
DR. CHRISTOPHER RENAUD.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.415
HE'S A PROFESSOR
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.157
BEEN MISSING FOR A WEEK.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.157
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

18:50.190 --> 18:51.259
OH, WE HAVE
OUR ANSWER.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.326
TINKLE.
CHIEF, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.499
OH, YOU NEED MY HELP.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.225
OH, I'VE GOT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT,
MR. SPENCER.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.261
YOU HAVE MORE
THAN YOUR SHARE OF GUMPTION.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.562
PLEASE, CHIEF,
THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.192
COME ON.
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.629
ONE MINUTE.
NO MORE.

19:04.670 --> 19:07.468
CHIEF, I READ
EVERY SINGLE WORKER ON THAT RIG.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.307
AND THEY ALL HATED HICKS.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.774
I'M GETTING TWO VERY DISTINCT
PSYCHIC VIBES HERE.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.471
THE FIRST--
THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY

19:13.520 --> 19:14.646
BEHIND HICKS'S DEATH.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.387
SECOND, CRAIG T. NELSON
WILL DONATE HIS REMAINING HAIR

19:17.420 --> 19:18.512
TO THE SMITHSONIAN.

19:18.550 --> 19:19.482
YEAH, LOOK, CHIEF,

19:19.520 --> 19:21.215
WE NEED HELP LEARNING MORE
ABOUT HICKS,

19:21.260 --> 19:23.478
AND A GOOD START WOULD BE ACCESS
TO WHERE HE LIVED.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.283
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE COMING TO ME WITH THIS.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.354
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO THE COMMANDER?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.527
SHE REALLY DOESN'T WANT US
INVOLVED WITH THIS CASE.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.528
REALLY?
IMAGINE THAT.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.492
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.531
AS THE COMMANDER POINTED OUT,

19:35.570 --> 19:36.537
THIS CASE IS OUT
OF MY JURISDICTION,

19:36.570 --> 19:38.606
AND YOUR MINUTE IS UP.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.608
GUS, WILL YOU EXCUSE US?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.574
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH THE CHIEF
IN PRIVATE.

19:42.610 --> 19:43.645
NO PROBLEM.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.204
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

19:45.250 --> 19:47.241
IT WAS SHAWN'S IDEA FOR US
TO GO WITH YOUR SISTER.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.217
KAREN.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.649
CHIEF KAREN.

19:55.690 --> 19:56.952
CHIEF KAREN VICK?

19:56.990 --> 19:59.379
THAT JUST FEELS A LITTLE LONG,
DOESN'T IT?

19:59.430 --> 20:01.421
I SAID I'M BUSY,
MR. SPENCER.

20:01.460 --> 20:02.950
I'M SENSING SOMETHING HERE.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.366
DON'T DO THAT.

20:06.930 --> 20:09.330
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON I TOOK
THIS CASE WAS TO HELP YOU.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.701
OH, REALLY?
HELP ME HOW?

20:10.740 --> 20:13.971
IF I CAN TIE THAT MURDER
TO A PIECE OF EVIDENCE ON LAND,

20:14.010 --> 20:15.671
THE CASE IS BACK
IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

20:15.710 --> 20:20.374
WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF SWEET.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.546
DON'T TELL ANYONE
I USED THAT WORD.

20:21.580 --> 20:22.342
DEAL.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.679
NOW I KNOW
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

20:25.720 --> 20:28.814
BUT WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU AND COMMANDER BABS?

20:28.860 --> 20:30.657
IT'S COM PLICATED.

20:30.690 --> 20:31.827
BELIEVE ME.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.589
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
GROWING UP WITH AN OLDER SISTER

20:33.630 --> 20:34.654
WHO GETS ALL THE ATTENTION.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.725
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
AN OLDER SISTER, SPENCER.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.591
I DON'T.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.666
BUT I DID WATCH A LOT OF RERUNS
OF THE BRADY BUNCH.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.834
YOU KNOW, BARBARA AND I WEREN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.338
I MEAN,
WE USED TO BE...

20:49.380 --> 20:50.574
WELL, CLOSE.

20:50.610 --> 20:51.645
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.819
AND BY I,
I MEAN JAN.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.481
SO WAS IT SOMETHING SPECIFIC

20:59.520 --> 21:00.748
THAT BROUGHT THINGS
TO A HEAD?

21:00.790 --> 21:04.385
NO, NOTHING SPECIFIC.

21:04.430 --> 21:08.753
IT'S JUST YEARS
OF TRYING TO OUTDO EACH OTHER.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.997
SO...

21:12.030 --> 21:13.964
SHOULD I GO DIVINE
THAT PIECE OF EVIDENCE

21:14.000 --> 21:15.035
I WAS REFERRING TO?

21:15.070 --> 21:17.732
I DON'T KNOW.
SHOULD YOU?

21:29.880 --> 21:34.658
[Gus grunts]

21:34.690 --> 21:35.714
SHAWN!

21:35.760 --> 21:38.684
OH, UH,
I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.357
THERE WE GO.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.753
RIGHT IN THERE.
OW.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.919
WOW, LOOKS LIKE HICKS'S
OBSESSION WITH SAFETY

21:46.970 --> 21:49.564
DID NOT EXTEND
TO HIS COLON.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.806
VICK WILL GO BALLISTIC

21:50.840 --> 21:52.068
IF SHE EVER FOUND OUT
WE BROKE IN HERE.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.236
WE DID NOT BREAK IN.
THE WINDOW WAS OPEN ALREADY.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.101
NOW COME ON.
WHAT THE HECK
ARE WE LOOKING FOR ANWVAY?

21:55.140 --> 21:57.506
ANYTHING HICKS MAY HAVE RECEIVED
WITH THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.700
CORRESPONDENCE, ANGRY PHONE
MESSAGES, MASH NOTES.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.945
MASH NOTES
ARE LOVE LETTERS, SHAWN.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.618
REALLY?

22:03.650 --> 22:06.448
REMIND ME.
I OWE SOMEONE A HUGE APOLOGY.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.958
LET'S START
WITH THIS COMPUTER.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.685
I GUESS I HAVE TO BREAK
THE PASS CODE.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.120
PANTHER2 1.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.421
PANTHER2 1?

22:19.470 --> 22:20.539
JUST TRY IT.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.564
[computer beeps]

22:24.610 --> 22:26.532
THAT'S IT.
MM-HMM.

22:26.570 --> 22:27.673
YOU GOT ALL THAT JUST
FROM PUTTING TOGETHER THINGS

22:27.710 --> 22:28.677
FROM AROUND THE ROOM?

22:28.710 --> 22:29.802
NO, IT WAS WRITTEN
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE COMPUTER.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.807
I SAW IT IN THE REFLECTION

22:30.850 --> 22:34.149
OF THE CD CASE.

22:34.180 --> 22:37.388
ALL RIGHT, ALMOST ALL
OF HIS RECENT EMAILS

22:37.420 --> 22:39.786
ARE FROM SOMEONE
CALLED BISHOP77.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.583
"WHY HAVEN'T
YOU CALLED ME BACK?

22:41.620 --> 22:42.780
"THE SITUATION ON THE RIG

22:42.820 --> 22:44.549
"IS GETTING MORE SERIOUS
EVERY DAY.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.888
WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME?"

22:46.930 --> 22:49.421
DUDE, LISTEN TO THIS ONE.

22:49.460 --> 22:50.722
"IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS,

22:50.770 --> 22:52.624
I'LL GO TO THE AUTHORITIES."

22:52.670 --> 22:53.989
DUDE, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.759
BISHOP77 IS THE ANONYMOUS
TIPSTER, NOT HICKS.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.006
AND IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT
WHO HE IS,

22:58.040 --> 22:59.132
WE COULD FIND OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON

22:59.170 --> 23:00.137
OUT ON THAT RIG.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.706
AND WHO KILLED HICKS,
AND WHY.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.776
BISHOP77. HE'S CATHOLIC,
OR HE PLAYS CHESS.

23:03.810 --> 23:04.879
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

23:04.910 --> 23:07.470
A GUY AT WORK SHOWED ME HOW
TO TAKE AN EMAIL ADDRESS

23:07.520 --> 23:08.919
AND GET ITS OWNER'S
REAL NAME.

23:08.950 --> 23:09.917
I'LL START BY USING
AN EMAIL HEADER

23:09.950 --> 23:12.145
TO TRACE BACK
TO THE ORIGINAL IP ADDRESS...

23:14.460 --> 23:15.711
WHAT?

23:15.760 --> 23:17.625
DEAR GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:17.660 --> 23:20.128
SHAWN, WHAT DID I TELL YOU

23:20.160 --> 23:22.128
ABOUT EATING ONIONS
DURING LUNCH?

23:22.160 --> 23:23.661
IT MAKES
YOUR BREATH STINK.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.724
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT YOU
THOSE MINTS.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.965
USE THEM.
DUDE, I DIDN'T EAT
ONIONS DURING LUNCH.

23:27.000 --> 23:27.967
I ATE EVERYTHING
BUT ONIONS.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.139
I DON'T SMELL
ANYTHING.

23:30.170 --> 23:33.435
[sniffing]

23:36.080 --> 23:37.968
THAT SMELLS GOOD.

23:38.010 --> 23:39.978
THAT SMELLS REALLY GOOD.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.617
DUDE, IT'S COMING
FROM INSIDE HERE.

23:45.650 --> 23:48.118
WELL, OPEN IT UP.

23:51.660 --> 23:52.581
[groaning]
OH.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.655
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE A DEAD GUY?

23:54.700 --> 23:55.826
WHY DOES HE SMELL
LIKE ONIONS?

23:55.860 --> 23:56.952
WILL YOU HELP ME?

24:00.770 --> 24:02.465
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS?

24:03.570 --> 24:05.231
IS THIS
YOUR MISSING PERSON?

24:05.270 --> 24:06.669
DR. CHRISTOPHER RENAUD.

24:06.710 --> 24:09.508
THAT'S LASSITER AND JULIET'S
MISSING PERSON.

24:19.950 --> 24:24.250
[Sirens blaring]

24:24.290 --> 24:25.484
[brakes screech]

24:29.900 --> 24:31.492
MR. SPENCER,
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

24:31.530 --> 24:32.667
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT,
HE WORKS FOR ME.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.531
MR. SPENCER,
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

24:34.570 --> 24:36.094
LOOK, THE REASON I CALLED
THE TWO OF YOU IS BECAUSE

24:36.140 --> 24:38.028
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSE
THAT CONCERNS YOU BOTH.

24:38.070 --> 24:40.834
(Vick)
OH, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU WENT INTO HICKS'S HOUSE

24:40.880 --> 24:41.938
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.642
HEY, WARRANT--NO ONE TALKED
TO ME ABOUT A WARRANT.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.669
I NEED A WARRANT?

24:45.710 --> 24:47.177
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

24:47.210 --> 24:49.872
I'M A DIVINER.
IT ALL HAPPENS HERE.

24:49.920 --> 24:54.880
AND HERE.
AND, IN EXTREME CASES, HERE.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.649
OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY IS
IN THERE?

24:56.690 --> 24:59.625
A MISSING PERSON.
PROFESSOR...RENAUD?

24:59.660 --> 25:01.855
THAT'S OUR MISSING PERSON.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.219
BUT WE NEVER FOUND A CONNECTION
BETWEEN HE AND HICKS.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.693
WE'LL CHECK IT OUT.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.538
WHAT WOULD RENAUD BE DOING
IN HICKS'S HOUSE?

25:08.570 --> 25:10.709
AND HOW DOES THIS AFFECT
MY CASE?

25:10.740 --> 25:11.707
OH, WAIT,
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

25:11.740 --> 25:12.661
TALKED ME INTO HIRING

25:12.710 --> 25:14.575
THIS FANCY ROCK DOCTOR.

25:14.610 --> 25:16.202
SHOWING ME WHERE TO DIG.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.879
WELL, I DON'T NEED ANYBODY
TO SHOW ME WHERE TO DIG.

25:18.910 --> 25:21.310
RENAUD WORKED
AS A CONSULTING GEOLOGIST

25:21.350 --> 25:23.580
FOR HICKS'S EMPLOYER,
BAMFORD EXPLORATION.

25:23.620 --> 25:24.541
(Juliet)
IT'S RENAUD.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.217
SPENCER'S RIGHT.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.150
NOT WORDS I ENJOY SAYING.

25:28.190 --> 25:29.714
OKAY, THEN.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.250
WELL, I'D SAY THAT TIES UP

25:31.290 --> 25:32.826
THE MISSING PERSON CASE
QUITE NICELY.

25:32.860 --> 25:34.725
THIS IS USUALLY

25:34.760 --> 25:39.094
THE PLACE WHERE YOU SAY,
"NICE WORK, SPENCER."

25:39.130 --> 25:40.631
[mumbles]

25:40.670 --> 25:42.092
I'M SORRY, CHIEF,
I DIDN'T CATCH THAT.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.632
SO THE VICTIM WORKED
FOR BAMFORD DRILLING.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.659
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH HICKS'S MURDER?

25:46.710 --> 25:47.802
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

25:47.840 --> 25:49.205
LET ME ASK THE QUESTIONS NOW

25:49.240 --> 25:50.776
BECAUSE IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T NOTICED, WE'RE ON LAND.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.846
WHICH BRINGS THIS CASE
BACK INTO MY JURISDICTION.

25:52.880 --> 25:53.949
LISTEN TO YOURSELF,
WILL YOU?

25:53.980 --> 25:55.277
"MY JURISDICTION."

25:55.320 --> 25:56.878
YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED
IN THIS CASE

25:56.920 --> 25:57.909
BECAUSE YOU'RE ITCHING

25:57.950 --> 25:59.144
TO HORN IN ON MY TURF.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.010
ITCHING?
OH, MY--LISTEN TO YOURSELF!

26:01.060 --> 26:02.357
YOUR TURF?

26:02.390 --> 26:04.756
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE
OCEAN, NOT THE TV ROOM.

26:04.790 --> 26:06.155
WHOA, WHOA,
SISTERS, PLEASE.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.920
NOBODY'S GETTING HORNED HERE.
TWO MEN ARE DEAD.

26:08.960 --> 26:12.088
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
FOR PETTY SIBLING SQUABBLES.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.688
THAT'S WHAT THANKSGIVING
IS FOR.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.628
WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER
AND WORK AS A GROUP

26:16.640 --> 26:18.198
AND THE TRUTH IS,

26:18.240 --> 26:20.606
RENAUD IS OUR ANONYMOUS TIPSTER,

26:20.640 --> 26:22.039
NOT HICKS.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.140
I CAN SEE A SERIES
OF EMAILS FROM RENAUD

26:25.180 --> 26:26.738
TO HICKS, THE SAFETY INSPECTOR,
WARNING HIM

26:26.780 --> 26:29.112
THAT SOMETHING UNSAFE
WAS HAPPENING ON THAT RIG.

26:29.150 --> 26:31.710
BUT HICKS, HE REFUSES
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE,

26:31.750 --> 26:33.388
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE'S COVERING
SOMETHING UP.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.684
AND THEN, FEARING THAT THE TRUTH
WOULD GET OUT,

26:35.720 --> 26:37.881
HE EXT--PSSH!
PSSH!

26:37.930 --> 26:39.386
STOP!
HAMMER TIME! WHOOSH!

26:39.430 --> 26:42.399
[continues to make
strange sounds]

26:42.430 --> 26:43.397
HICKS KILLS RENAUD.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.898
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT WAS HICKS TRYING TO HIDE?

26:45.930 --> 26:49.195
THANK YOU FOR THAT ELOQUENT
SUMMATION, MR. SPENCER.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.298
IT'S MY PLEASURE,
CHIEF.

26:50.340 --> 26:51.364
I THINK OUR NEXT MOVE
SHOULD BE--

26:51.410 --> 26:54.072
FOR ME TO HAVE LASSITER
AND O'HARA NOW LOOK INTO IT.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.045
WAIT, WAIT.
OKAY, THIS IS GREAT.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.969
BARBARA JUST WITNESSED THE CHIEF
CHOOSE ME OVER SPENCER.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.648
IN HER EYES,
MY STOCK JUST WENT UP.

27:04.690 --> 27:05.486
NOW IF I COULD JUST GET HER

27:05.520 --> 27:07.715
TO WITNESS ME DISCHARGE
MY WEAPON.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.387
(Dunlap)
WELL, MR. SPENCER,
THIS CASE DOES WARRANT

27:11.430 --> 27:12.954
FURTHER INVESTIGATION

27:12.990 --> 27:14.799
ON MY END AS WELL.

27:14.830 --> 27:15.797
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU, COMMANDER.

27:15.830 --> 27:17.889
I THINK THE FIRST THING
WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE

27:17.930 --> 27:19.067
IS WHY HICKS WAS
IN NO MAN'S LAND.

27:19.100 --> 27:19.998
I MEAN,
THE SAFETY INSPECTOR,

27:20.030 --> 27:21.759
OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.631
YEAH, AND I'LL HAVE
MY PEOPLE LOOK INTO THAT.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.769
OH, YEAH, BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE FIRED.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.239
FIRED?

27:31.280 --> 27:33.100
NOBODY FIRES ME,
SHAWN.

27:33.150 --> 27:34.219
WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

27:34.250 --> 27:35.410
I CAN'T STOP
ASKING MYSELF,

27:35.450 --> 27:38.385
WHY WAS THE GEOLOGIST'S OFFICE
THE ONLY DOOR THAT WAS LOCKED?

27:38.420 --> 27:40.786
I'M TELLING YOU,
SOMETHING WAS IN THERE.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.117
WE GOTTA GET BACK
ON THAT RIG.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.889
BUT HOW?
I HAVE AN IDEA.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.818
IS IT GOOD?
NOT REALLY.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.359
(Shawn)
DAD!

27:48.400 --> 27:50.254
W-W-WAIT! WAIT, WAIT.
AH, THANK GOD!

27:50.300 --> 27:52.097
HEY, SHAWN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:52.130 --> 27:54.860
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
GUS AND I THOUGHT

27:54.900 --> 27:56.868
MAYBE WE'D GO OUT WITH YOU
TODAY.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.128
WELL, THAT'S A FIRST--EVERY TIME
I ASK YOU TO GO OUT FISHING,

27:58.170 --> 27:59.831
YOU USUALLY COME UP
WITH SOME LAME EXCUSE.

27:59.870 --> 28:01.235
WHAT WAS IT LAST TIME?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.838
IT WAS...ONE WORD.
BOOKS.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.178
THAT'S FUNNY.

28:05.210 --> 28:06.768
WHAT CAN I SAY?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.869
WE'RE BOTH IN THE MOOD
FOR SOME SERIOUS ANGLING.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.376
HUH?

28:10.420 --> 28:11.842
[grunts]

28:11.890 --> 28:14.154
WE HEARD
THE BIG ONES ARE BITING.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.214
(Henry)
THAT'S FUNNY.

28:15.260 --> 28:18.320
I HEARD THAT THE STORM SCARED
ALL THE FISH AWAY.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.918
WAIT A MINUTE.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.894
WHAT DID YOU HEAR IS BITING?

28:21.930 --> 28:22.897
IT'S NOT PIKE,
IS IT?

28:22.930 --> 28:25.865
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT WAS PIKE.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.322
MAN, THE PIKE IS BITING.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.759
YEAH, WELL,
PIKE IS A FRESHWATER FISH.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.233
IN CASE
YOU MORONS HAVEN'T NOTICED,

28:31.270 --> 28:33.204
THAT'S THE OCEAN
OUT THERE.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.969
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:35.010 --> 28:37.740
WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE
WE NEED TO SOLVE A CASE

28:37.780 --> 28:39.042
IS ON AN OFFSHORE OIL RIG.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.968
IT'S THE BAMFORD NUMBER SEVEN.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.817
AND WE WERE HOPING THAT YOU
COULD GIVE US A LIFT OUT THERE.

28:42.850 --> 28:45.114
CAN'T DO IT.
SORRY, GUYS.

28:45.150 --> 28:46.515
EVEN IF I WAS SO INCLINED,

28:46.550 --> 28:47.858
THIS BOAT ISN'T DESIGNED
TO GO OUT THAT FAR.

28:47.890 --> 28:49.414
DAD, COME ON,
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.189
IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT SOLVING THE CASE.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.424
WE GOTTA GET BACK
IN VICK'S GOOD GRACES.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.825
SHAWN, CANNOT DO IT.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.828
SHOCKING.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.999
BUT I THINK I GOT
A FRIEND OVER HERE--

28:58.030 --> 28:59.361
CAPTAIN DALE MIGHT BE ABLE

28:59.400 --> 29:00.936
TO HELP YOU OUT.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.901
COURSE, YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
SOME CHORES.

29:10.510 --> 29:13.206
CHORES?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.309
[knocks]

29:19.820 --> 29:21.515
HEY.
CAN I COME IN?

29:21.560 --> 29:22.481
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BARB?

29:22.520 --> 29:24.454
HERE TO ARGUE SOME MORE
ABOUT JURISDICTION?

29:24.490 --> 29:26.287
ACTUALLY, NO.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.797
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO, SO...

29:27.830 --> 29:29.195
WELL, THE THING IS,
IS I HAD MY PEOPLE

29:29.230 --> 29:31.425
LOOK INTO WHAT SPENCER SAID.

29:31.470 --> 29:35.065
WHAT WAS HICKS DOING OUT
IN NO MAN'S LAND?

29:35.100 --> 29:36.931
DID SOMEBODY LURE HIM
OUT THERE?

29:36.970 --> 29:39.359
SO I TOOK A TRIP
OUT TO THE RIG,

29:39.410 --> 29:40.399
HAD A LOOK AT THE CRANE,

29:40.440 --> 29:42.874
AND IT TURNS OUT THE CRANE
HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

29:44.210 --> 29:46.849
HICKS WAS MURDERED.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.040
AND I WAS WRONG.

29:51.150 --> 29:53.482
UM...

29:55.090 --> 29:57.513
SPENCER WAS RIGHT

29:57.560 --> 29:59.585
ABOUT HICKS
MURDERING RENAUD.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.393
HIS PRINTS WERE ALL OVER
THE MURDER WEAPON.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.819
WELL, THEN, WE NEED
TO FIND SPENCER

30:03.870 --> 30:04.928
AND SEE WHAT ELSE
HE'S FIGURED OUT.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.934
LEAD THE WAY.

30:07.970 --> 30:09.892
CAN I?
YEAH.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.407
LET'S GO.

30:25.990 --> 30:26.945
DAMN THAT CAPTAIN DALE.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.252
I STILL SMELL LIKE FISH.

30:28.290 --> 30:29.257
I HATE FISH.

30:29.290 --> 30:30.109
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.287
YOU LOVE
MY CAJUN CRAWFISH HUSHPUPPIES.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.355
THAT'S MOSTLY CORNMEAL,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.595
[lock clicks open]

30:45.970 --> 30:47.107
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO MY CREDIT CARD.

30:47.140 --> 30:47.936
YOU RUINED IT.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.631
DUDE, IT HAD
A 29.7% INTEREST RATE.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.238
I DID YOU A FAVOR.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.941
STOP COMPLAINING.
START LOOKING.

30:55.450 --> 30:59.113
YOU GOOD
ON LITMUS PAPER?

31:11.070 --> 31:12.059
HUH.

31:19.540 --> 31:22.008
WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT?

31:22.040 --> 31:25.578
LOOKS LIKE A MAP.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.579
B.R. NUMBER SEVEN.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.987
(Bamford)
I DON'T NEED NOBODY
TO TELL ME WHERE TO DIG.

31:32.020 --> 31:36.411
WHY WOULD RENAUD HAND DRAW
A MAP THAT ALREADY EXISTED?

31:36.460 --> 31:37.984
REMEMBER THAT MAP
WE SAW IN THE CORRIDOR?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.554
YEAH.
YEAH.
GO GRAB IT.

32:15.460 --> 32:16.495
THAT'S WHAT RENAUD MEANT
WHEN HE SAID

32:16.530 --> 32:17.997
THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING
UNSAFE.

32:18.030 --> 32:19.998
THEY'RE NOT DRILLING WHERE
THEY SAY THEY'RE DRILLING.

32:20.030 --> 32:29.701
THEY'RE DRILLING DIRECTLY
ON A FAULT LINE.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.298
THIS IS A PRIVATE LAB.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.408
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING
IN HERE?

32:32.450 --> 32:35.317
DUDE, I GOT THIS.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.147
ASHLEY, THE TRUTH IS
THAT I'M A PSYCHIC.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.489
A DAMN GOOD ONE,
I'VE BEEN TOLD.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.385
I AM SENSING
THAT THERE IS STUFF GOING ON

32:41.420 --> 32:44.457
THAT WILL BE HARD
FOR YOU TO HEAR.

32:44.490 --> 32:49.291
VERY HARD.

32:49.330 --> 32:52.094
VERY, VERY HARD.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.291
DAMN, GIRL,
YOU ARE SO LEAN.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.398
WHAT, DO YOU SPIN?

32:55.440 --> 32:56.759
SHAWN, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU GOT THIS.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.166
SORRY.
I'M--I'M SEEING FAULTS.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.599
UH, FAULTY SOMETHING.
FAULTY INTELLIGENCE.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.176
FAULTY WIRING.
FAWLTY TOWERS.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.142
SHAWN.
FAULT.

33:04.180 --> 33:08.412
YOUR FATHER IS DRILLING
INTO A FAULT LINE.

33:08.450 --> 33:10.418
WHAT?

33:10.450 --> 33:11.610
YEAH, HE MADE
A FAKE MAP

33:11.650 --> 33:13.447
WITH THE HELP
OF DR. DRE.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.651
NO, DR. PEPPER.

33:15.690 --> 33:17.009
NO, DR. NO.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.254
NO, DR.--DR. RENAUD!

33:18.290 --> 33:19.257
RENAUD!

33:19.290 --> 33:21.451
OUR GEOLOGIST.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE'S MORE.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.718
UNFORTUNATELY,
I THINK YOUR FATHER

33:23.760 --> 33:25.227
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATHS

33:25.270 --> 33:27.124
OF DR. RENAUD AND HICKS.

33:27.170 --> 33:29.730
I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO COVER HIS TRACKS.

33:32.170 --> 33:34.070
I'M--I'M SORRY.

33:34.110 --> 33:36.499
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT DAD WOULD DO THAT.

33:36.540 --> 33:37.575
[softly]
I KNOW.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.373
I MEAN,
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A RISK-TAKER,

33:39.410 --> 33:42.413
WILLING TO GAMBLE
EVERYTHING...

33:42.450 --> 33:45.613
IF HE THOUGHT THERE WAS OIL
TO BE FOUND.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.387
BUT I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE WOULD DO THIS.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.385
I FEEL SICK.

33:53.430 --> 33:55.159
IT'S OKAY.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.054
WE'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.567
PROBABLY OVER DINNER.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.659
I WAS THINKING TAPAS, BUT
I COULD BE TALKED INTO GREEK.

34:00.700 --> 34:01.462
SHAWN!

34:01.500 --> 34:03.297
WE NEED TO STOP DRILLING
IMMEDIATELY.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.307
RIGHT.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.534
AND AS FAR AS DINNER GOES,

34:05.570 --> 34:07.060
LET'S JUST PUT A PIN IN IT.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.505
THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM
IS DOWN THE HALL.

34:10.540 --> 34:12.098
WE'LL RADIO UP TO THE FLOOR

34:12.150 --> 34:16.314
AND TELL THEM
TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS.

34:16.350 --> 34:18.614
(Ashley)
THE LIGHT IS
ON THE OPPOSITE WALL.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.515
I'LL TURN
ON THE RADIO.

34:20.550 --> 34:21.756
(Shawn)
I KNOW IT ISN'T EASY,
HEARING THAT YOUR FATHER ISN'T

34:21.790 --> 34:23.781
WHO YOU THOUGHT HE WAS, BUT
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.381
THIS IS THE RADIO ROOM?

34:27.430 --> 34:28.419
ASHLEY!

34:28.460 --> 34:30.325
SWEETIE POP.
COME ON NOW.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.362
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME
BACK OUT HERE, SHAWN.

34:32.400 --> 34:36.291
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET RID OF YOU.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.505
I MIGHT HAVE MADE
A MISTAKE.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.543
SHE FILLS THOSE JEANS OUT
QUITE NICELY, THOUGH.

34:48.450 --> 34:50.441
SHAWN, THAT SIGN SAYS
"TOXIC FUMES."

34:50.480 --> 34:51.845
I AM BREATHING IN
TOXIC FUMES.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.448
COME ON, DUDE.

34:53.490 --> 34:55.515
YOU THINK THE COMPANY'S GONNA
EXPOSE THEIR EMPLOYEES

34:55.560 --> 34:56.857
TO STUFF
THAT'S REALLY HARMFUL?

34:56.890 --> 34:58.528
DID YOU NOT SEE SILKWOOD,
SHAWN?

34:58.560 --> 34:59.527
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE ME
TAKE A SHOWER

34:59.560 --> 35:00.629
WHERE THEY SCRUB
MY SKIN OFF.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.860
MISS BAMFORD,
CAN WE TALK TO YOU?

35:05.900 --> 35:08.198
UM, CAN IT WAIT?
I'M REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.332
NO, NO, NO. SORRY, HONEY,
IT CAN'T WAIT.

35:09.370 --> 35:10.860
SEE, WE KNOW THAT HICKS'S DEATH
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.709
THAT HE WAS MURDERED.

35:12.740 --> 35:13.900
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
SOLID ALIBIS

35:13.940 --> 35:14.907
FROM EVERYBODY ON THE RIG
THAT NIGHT.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.534
THE HELICOPTER PILOT
WHO BROUGHT THE WORKERS OUT

35:17.580 --> 35:19.207
FOR THEIR SHIFT SAID THERE WAS
AN EXTRA PASSENGER ONBOARD

35:19.250 --> 35:20.603
WHO WASN'T ON THE MANIFEST.

35:20.650 --> 35:22.538
THAT PASSENGER WAS YOU,
MISS BAMFORD.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.514
YEAH, WE'RE HOPING
YOU CAN CLEAR THIS UP FOR US.

35:24.550 --> 35:25.881
WHY WERE YOU OUT THERE
THAT NIGHT?

35:25.920 --> 35:27.808
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU WANT
YOUR NAME ON THE MANIFEST?

35:27.850 --> 35:29.317
OH, WELL,
THAT'S SIMPLE.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.352
I WAS, UM,
YOU SEE--

35:32.390 --> 35:35.393
SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO MAKE SURPRISE VISITS.

35:35.430 --> 35:36.522
SHE'S GOT A WEAPON!

35:36.560 --> 35:37.788
(Vick)
HALT!

35:46.440 --> 35:47.759
WE GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.607
SHAWN, I THINK THE RULE
IS WHEN YOU HEAR GUNFIRE,

35:49.640 --> 35:50.607
YOU DON'T GO
TOWARDS IT.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.607
WE'RE IN HERE!

35:51.650 --> 35:52.878
WE'RE IN HERE!
WE'RE IN HERE!

35:58.420 --> 35:59.546
WE'RE IN HERE!

36:02.660 --> 36:04.321
OH, JULES, LASSIE.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.554
THANK GOD.
IT'S ASHLEY BAMFORD.

36:05.590 --> 36:06.557
SHE'S ARMED.

36:06.590 --> 36:07.625
WE KNOW.
WE'RE IN PURSUIT.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.252
YOU TWO STAY PUT.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.289
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

36:10.330 --> 36:12.321
GOT IT.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.867
WHAT PART OF "STAY PUT"
IS CONFUSING TO YOU?

36:14.900 --> 36:16.492
THE PUT PART.
STAY PUT?

36:16.540 --> 36:17.666
I WASN'T PUT
IN THE FIRST PLACE, GUS.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.406
THE EXPRESSION
IS A COMPLETE DISASTER.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.429
OOH, LOOK.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.268
WHAT'S HER 20?

36:29.320 --> 36:31.345
ON THE LEFT.
30 FEET.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.641
NAH, IT'S MORE LIKE 35 FEET.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.884
DAMN IT.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.649
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FEEL
LIKE YOU HAVE TO CORRECT ME?

36:35.690 --> 36:36.657
WAS I CORRECTING?
I DON'T MEAN TO CORRECT.

36:36.690 --> 36:38.487
YEAH.
I'M SORRY.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.897
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

36:47.930 --> 36:49.431
I HAVE A PLAN.

36:49.470 --> 36:51.506
IT'S CALLED "GUS IS A TABLE."
[gunfire]

37:00.680 --> 37:01.715
I'M A WHAT?

37:01.750 --> 37:03.615
IT WAS OUR SIGNATURE PRANK
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.

37:03.650 --> 37:04.639
I KNOW
YOU REMEMBER THIS.

37:04.690 --> 37:05.645
"GUS IS A TABLE."

37:05.690 --> 37:06.679
LET ME GET THI--

37:16.960 --> 37:18.689
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.664
YOU WANT ME TO SNEAK UP
BEHIND HER ON ALL FOURS,

37:20.700 --> 37:21.894
SO YOU CAN PUSH HER,
AND SHE'LL FALL OVER ME?

37:21.940 --> 37:23.362
EXACTLY.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.459
I'LL DISTRACT HER
WHILE YOU GET IN POSITION.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.447
ASHLEY?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.573
HON?
SHAWN?

37:36.620 --> 37:37.746
DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT YOU.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.714
IT'S OKAY.
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.786
I'M PUTTING
MY CARDS ON THE TABLE.

37:41.820 --> 37:45.426
RIGHT SMACK DAB ON THE TABLE!

37:45.460 --> 37:46.688
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S TOO LATE.

37:46.730 --> 37:47.754
(Shawn)
NO, NO, NO, NO!

37:47.790 --> 37:48.996
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.721
GUS IS A TABLE.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.590
GUS IS A STATUE.
(Shawn)
YOU'RE A SELLOUT!

37:53.630 --> 37:54.597
(Ashley)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:54.640 --> 37:55.629
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:55.670 --> 37:58.332
NOTHING. NOTHING, NOTHING.
NOTHING'S GOING ON.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.702
DON'T COME
ANY CLOSER, SHAWN.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.708
WHAT IS HE DOING?

38:03.740 --> 38:05.469
I HAVE NO IDEA.

38:05.510 --> 38:07.046
SHAWN, GET OUT OF THERE!

38:07.080 --> 38:08.775
JULIET, STAY BACK.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.640
ALL OF YOU,
STAY BACK.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.819
AND STOP SHOOTING.

38:14.090 --> 38:17.514
LOOK, ASHLEY...

38:18.660 --> 38:19.888
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

38:19.930 --> 38:22.490
TO HAVE A DAD

38:22.530 --> 38:24.794
THAT DOES NOT APPRECIATE
OR RESPECT YOU.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.695
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I SEE.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.959
I SEE
A GORGEOUS YOUNG WOMAN

38:32.010 --> 38:33.068
WITH A SMART JACKET.

38:33.110 --> 38:35.931
AND AN IMPRESSIVE EDUCATION,

38:35.980 --> 38:39.802
AND EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE
ARM MUSCLE TONE,

38:39.850 --> 38:43.718
WHO DESPERATELY WANTED TO SAVE
HER FATHER'S CRUMBLING BUSINESS.

38:43.750 --> 38:46.787
I KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU HAD
RENAUD MAKE THE FAKE MAP,

38:46.820 --> 38:48.458
SO THAT NOBODY WOULD KNOW
YOU WERE DRILLING

38:48.490 --> 38:49.457
INTO A DANGEROUS FAULT LINE.

38:49.490 --> 38:51.958
AND WHEN BUTCH HICKS FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT,

38:51.990 --> 38:53.753
YOU DID WHAT ANY GOOD CHILD
WOULD DO

38:53.790 --> 38:55.826
IN YOUR PLACE.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.851
YOU HAD NO CHOICE.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.561
YOU HAD TO KILL HIM.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.864
I COULDN'T HAVE LET HICKS
OR ANYONE ELSE GET IN THE WAY.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.094
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
DON'T YOU, SHAWN?

39:03.140 --> 39:04.437
OF COURSE I DO.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.437
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

39:05.470 --> 39:07.859
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

39:10.780 --> 39:11.940
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:11.980 --> 39:13.379
GIVE ME THAT.

39:13.410 --> 39:15.640
GIVE ME THAT GUN.

39:17.650 --> 39:20.118
IT'S OKAY.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.629
COME HERE.

39:28.760 --> 39:29.749
[grunts]

39:33.600 --> 39:35.397
DID BARBARA SEE THAT?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.567
[sighs]

39:41.740 --> 39:44.174
WELL, I GOTTA SAY,
MR. SPENCER,

39:44.210 --> 39:45.177
NICE WORK.

39:45.210 --> 39:46.541
THANKS, CHIEF.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.002
NO HELP
TO MY TABLE.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.540
NO HELP
TO MY TABLE.

39:49.580 --> 39:50.569
[scoffs]

39:54.890 --> 39:56.414
THIS REALLY ISN'T NECESSARY.

39:56.460 --> 39:57.813
I ALREADY TOLD YOU GUYS
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.623
IN FACT, I SHOULD BE GIVING
YOU GIFTS

39:59.660 --> 40:01.548
FOR BRINGING ME AND MY SISTER
BACK TOGETHER.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.726
CHIEF, STOP IT.

40:02.760 --> 40:03.852
THE ONLY GIFT
WE'LL EVER NEED FROM YOU

40:03.900 --> 40:05.595
IS YOUR SWEET, TOOTHY SMILE.

40:05.630 --> 40:07.769
AND ANY POSSIBLE CASES
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEND

40:07.800 --> 40:08.767
OUR WAY.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.563
BUT MOSTLY
THE TOOTHY SMILE.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.567
KNOCK, KNOCK,
KNOCK.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.565
HEY.

40:12.610 --> 40:13.634
WELL, AHOY, COMMANDER.

40:13.670 --> 40:14.705
WELCOME ABOARD.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.105
THAR SHE BLOWS.

40:16.140 --> 40:17.801
ALL HANDS ON DECK.

40:17.840 --> 40:18.807
OKAY, ENOUGH,
THE PAINFULLY CUTE MUGGING

40:18.850 --> 40:19.600
IS STARTING
TO GET ON MY NERVES.

40:19.650 --> 40:22.619
WHAT ARE YOU,
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY?

40:22.650 --> 40:23.617
SO WE STILL ON FOR LUNCH,
KARE?

40:23.650 --> 40:24.685
ABSOLUTELY.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.642
[chuckles]
THIS IS KIND OF AWKWARD,

40:26.690 --> 40:30.615
BUT I'M THINKING OF ASKING OUT
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.786
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.980
[Gus and Shawn make noises]

40:34.030 --> 40:36.897
OH, UM, UM,
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.693
REALLY?
WHY?

40:38.730 --> 40:41.893
IT'S JUST HE'S A LITTLE,
UM, WOUND UP.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.498
AND TRUST ME,
YOU'D BE FAR BETTER OFF

40:43.540 --> 40:44.507
PURSUING SOMEBODY ELSE.

40:44.540 --> 40:45.359
I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.605
OH, I GET IT.
YOU WANT HIM FOR YOURSELF.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.937
WHAT?

40:48.980 --> 40:50.800
NO, I'M MARRIED, BARB.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.171
AND EVEN IF I WEREN'T,

40:52.210 --> 40:53.177
I MEAN, CARLTON?

40:53.210 --> 40:54.973
OH.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.942
OH, N-N-N-NO.
NO, NO.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.072
N-N-N-NO?

40:58.120 --> 40:58.916
NO.

40:58.950 --> 41:00.986
[chuckles]
OH, YOU ARE SO TRANSPARENT.

41:01.020 --> 41:01.987
(Vick)
TRANSPARENT?

41:02.020 --> 41:02.987
YOU CAN'T STAND TO SEE ME

41:03.020 --> 41:04.157
WITH SOMEONE
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO.

41:04.190 --> 41:05.657
ALL OF A SUDDEN TOO,
BY THE WAY.

41:05.690 --> 41:07.487
OFTEN--TRANSPARENT--
YOU KNOW, FINE.

41:07.530 --> 41:09.657
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ASK OUT LASSITER.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.156
I WILL.
GO AHEAD.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.792
YOU, ME, LUNCH.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.966
AYE, AYE.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.661
[laughs]

41:20.710 --> 41:23.804
SO I TAKE IT THE SIBLING RIVALRY
IS BACK ON?

41:23.840 --> 41:24.977
OH, IT'S ON.

41:25.010 --> 41:27.604
AND I AM SO WINNING.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.147
OW!

41:30.180 --> 41:31.841
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
