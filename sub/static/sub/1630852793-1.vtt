WEBVTT

00:09.291 --> 00:11.083
I'm so happy we're together again.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.875
-Me too.
-Just like before.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.833
Shit! We've never been apart this long!

00:20.416 --> 00:21.416
What?

00:21.500 --> 00:23.291
It's Sioux. My mother taught me.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.791
Then again, who else could you have
celebrated your birthday with?

00:35.875 --> 00:38.833
Honestly, who else besides your real BFF?

00:38.916 --> 00:40.375
I can't believe what she did.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.875
-Anyway, I don't want to talk about it.
-Yeah.

00:42.958 --> 00:44.666
She barely apologized.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.875
And she said it was over,
that it was just a "one-shot,"

00:47.958 --> 00:49.500
when clearly, it wasn't.

00:49.583 --> 00:53.541
It's insane to not be able to forgive.
To forgive is to grow.

00:53.625 --> 00:54.500
Yeah.

00:54.583 --> 00:57.583
And come on,
they broke up like 102 years ago.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.541
And it's not like Max and me
are just all about sex.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.750
No, this is freaking true love.

01:02.833 --> 01:05.708
-Anyway, I don't want to talk about it.
-Yes, let's stop there.

01:05.791 --> 01:07.333
-Who cares about all that?
-Yeah.

01:07.416 --> 01:08.791
-Who cares?
-For real.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.916
-So you still see her?
-And you still see her?

01:14.083 --> 01:15.166
No.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.166
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:18.500 --> 01:19.833
THE LAME PLAN

01:19.916 --> 01:21.500
THE CRAZY PLAN

01:21.583 --> 01:24.375
THE BOOTY PLAN

01:24.458 --> 01:26.166
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

01:26.250 --> 01:28.708
Well, it depends on
what you mean by "seeing."

01:28.791 --> 01:33.958
I see her face, but just in passing, on…
social media, stuff like that.

01:34.041 --> 01:35.000
Oh good!

01:36.250 --> 01:40.041
Sorority, sorori-me,
sorori-you, sorori-us!

01:42.916 --> 01:46.833
How are things at the foundation?
Do you miss Piotr a lot? Since he died?

01:46.916 --> 01:47.916
No, he's here.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.375
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.291
-But…
-I mean, his ashes are.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.375
But when it comes to work, he's useless.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.833
I'm making great progress on my own,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.625
on awesome projects,
and there's Suzanne, his daughter,

01:58.708 --> 02:02.208
who's managing from a distance,
and we get along super well. It's ideal.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.291
-You're ideal.
-Thanks.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.500
Come to the country this weekend.

02:06.583 --> 02:07.500
To recharge.

02:07.583 --> 02:08.958
Away from the pollution.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.458
You're inviting me 'cause Elsa can't go?

02:11.541 --> 02:12.458
Not at all.

02:12.541 --> 02:14.416
I'm inviting you because I adore you.

02:17.083 --> 02:20.583
Sorori-love, sorori-sis, sorori-sex!

02:21.750 --> 02:22.916
For this weekend?

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Honestly, the countryside
right now is divine.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.333
-Isn't it fucking freezing?
-What?

02:29.416 --> 02:30.875
No. It's a microclimate.

02:30.958 --> 02:33.666
I'm sure, but I'm ovulating this weekend.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.083
-You're ovulating all weekend?
-Yes.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.833
You want to ovulate at my place?

02:37.916 --> 02:39.583
I'm trying to avoid moving around.

02:39.666 --> 02:43.458
And I've set an alarm, too,
to go pee on my fertility test.

02:43.958 --> 02:46.250
She and the man-whore
really want to reproduce?

02:46.333 --> 02:49.000
That doesn't fit with
her whole sustainability thing.

02:50.791 --> 02:51.625
What is that?

02:51.708 --> 02:54.625
-It's Gayusha. She's a fertility goddess.
-Yes.

02:54.708 --> 02:58.208
We've been trying to have a baby
for a while, but this time it'll work.

02:58.291 --> 03:01.166
It's a gift from my shaman.
I mean, it cost 63 euros, but…

03:01.250 --> 03:02.875
-Then it's not a gift.
-Yes, it is.

03:02.958 --> 03:04.541
-The cassoulets!
-Wow!

03:04.625 --> 03:06.458
It's the vegan cassoulet!

03:06.541 --> 03:07.375
I love it!

03:07.458 --> 03:08.625
Namaste. Thank you!

03:08.708 --> 03:10.750
-It's delicious.
-It's a generous serving.

03:10.833 --> 03:11.833
Yes, it is.

03:11.916 --> 03:14.416
-You need to mix it like this.
-Isn't it already mixed?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.583
It looks like they've already mixed it.

03:16.666 --> 03:18.916
-The flavors burst in your mouth.
-Yes.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.416
Around my place? It's a basin.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.541
It never gets cold.
And your brother will be happy to see you.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.541
Sorry, it's too complicated.

03:26.625 --> 03:28.125
-Shit.
-I'm overwhelmed right now.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.625
Because of Pinkars?

03:29.708 --> 03:32.250
No, it's running itself.
I don't even go into the office.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.208
-I'm probably going to sell it.
-Really?

03:34.291 --> 03:35.125
-Yeah.
-Why?

03:35.208 --> 03:36.250
Max wants to.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.791
Right now, we're focusing
on the campaign, love, politics.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.708
I'm going to realize a lifelong dream.

03:42.791 --> 03:44.875
-President of the Republic.
-Wow, that big.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.500
We're aiming for mayor
of the 9th district, but--

03:47.583 --> 03:48.666
What do you mean "we're"?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.166
Only one of you can be mayor.

03:50.250 --> 03:53.583
He's me. I'm him.
It's the same thing. When he wins, I win.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.416
But it's more like you're paying,
and he's getting it.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.000
Wait, she's going into politics?

03:58.083 --> 04:00.625
No, actually, it's not her.
That's the thing…

04:00.708 --> 04:03.000
What voters is she representing?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.000
A 33-year-old boomer, no conscience,

04:05.083 --> 04:07.208
in a world facing environmental disaster?

04:07.291 --> 04:08.416
You're not hungry?

04:10.833 --> 04:11.666
I am.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.625
But I had

04:14.333 --> 04:15.208
a side.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.125
Shit.

04:17.125 --> 04:17.958
Wait.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.458
How's Antoine taking it?

04:21.375 --> 04:23.333
Not too young, I hope.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.500
What? No. A side dish,

04:28.625 --> 04:30.250
not a young side piece.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.875
But Milou, fasting is not always--

04:34.958 --> 04:36.208
-Yes, anyway.
-It's not.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.833
Don't change the subject.
Why do you want a boob job?

04:38.916 --> 04:41.208
I want to be perfect for him.
You think it's love?

04:41.291 --> 04:42.958
No, I don't, no.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.708
Britney, Rihanna.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.291
Namaste.<i> </i>Great.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.750
-What's that?
-Waste.

04:50.833 --> 04:51.750
Waste?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.833
-It's for my compost.
-Meaning?

04:53.916 --> 04:56.916
Compost is much more effective
than any chemical fertilizer.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.583
What I would like is to collect
all the peelings from the city

05:00.666 --> 05:01.916
and send them to farmers.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.083
No, you're right.

05:03.166 --> 05:06.083
She wants Parisians
to dump their compost in farmers' faces?

05:06.166 --> 05:07.166
That's right.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.375
Why don't we just throw them our poop too?

05:09.458 --> 05:11.958
-I'm growing a small vegetable garden.
-Oh, nice!

05:12.041 --> 05:13.708
Julio and I put everything in there.

05:13.791 --> 05:14.875
-Okay.
-Even our poop.

05:14.958 --> 05:16.750
And it yields delicious vegetables.

05:16.833 --> 05:17.666
You want some?

05:18.916 --> 05:19.958
What are we talking about?

05:20.041 --> 05:21.875
After that, she eats the vegetables.

05:22.791 --> 05:25.791
-She's taking her yoga thing really far.
-I gotta admit.

05:27.875 --> 05:30.041
You won't believe it!
It's time! The big moment!

05:31.125 --> 05:32.416
-Is that my present?
-Yes!

05:34.083 --> 05:35.583
-Present!
-Thanks.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.125
-It's the smaller version?
-It's its baby.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.208
It costs a little less,
but it's still expensive!

05:43.291 --> 05:44.333
Thank you.

05:44.916 --> 05:47.791
-She loves her present.
-Yes, I love it. Thanks.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.083
-Hang on. I'm talking.
-You're on the phone?

05:52.666 --> 05:53.625
What is it?

05:54.208 --> 05:55.041
Is it poop?

05:55.125 --> 05:56.125
No, it's a seed.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.666
-From Parapoutna.
-What's that?

05:58.750 --> 06:01.000
-It's good luck in India.
-It is?

06:01.083 --> 06:04.666
I'll take it. Because honestly,
let me tell you, lately, with Antoine--

06:04.750 --> 06:06.083
Just a sec. Fertility pee!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.208
Right now?

06:07.291 --> 06:09.083
Okay. Gayusha!

06:10.583 --> 06:12.416
It looks like a dehydrated poop.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.875
And Eddy, how is he?

06:13.958 --> 06:16.458
He's fine. Well, I say "fine,"
but, you know, he's two.

06:16.541 --> 06:17.583
As in "terrible twos."

06:17.666 --> 06:19.875
-I love you so fucking much!
-I love you too.

06:19.958 --> 06:20.875
Still no.

06:21.583 --> 06:22.541
Yeah, of course.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.583
What about this weekend?

06:24.666 --> 06:26.500
-Well, I told you, if you want…
-No.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.916
We need to work on your speech.
Absolutely. Yeah.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.041
You're really the best.

06:32.583 --> 06:33.916
Hello? Milou?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.541
-I'm talking to you.
-Sorry.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.833
-Thanks.
-She's not listening. I gotta run.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.708
-Already?
-Yeah. It's on me.

06:41.541 --> 06:42.375
Yes.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.583
I'm ovulating. I need to go have sex!

06:46.333 --> 06:47.166
Sorry!

06:47.250 --> 06:49.916
Can you front me for lunch? I owe you one.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.500
-What?
-Namaste,<i> </i>Milou. Let me take Gayusha.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.583
-But…
-Thanks.

06:53.666 --> 06:54.875
No, I can't.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.625
Milou! Fingers crossed.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.791
See you!
Yes, I'm coming. I'll meet you there.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.791
Kisses. Ciao. Yeah, okay.

07:01.875 --> 07:02.916
We're back in business?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.625
So, Emilie, how are you?

07:05.416 --> 07:08.416
Getting used to the countryside?
How's Antoine? Better?

07:12.875 --> 07:15.083
Yes. I'm hungry.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.875
-Hurry up and put this on!
-Yes. Okay.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.458
You look gorgeous.

07:25.541 --> 07:27.083
-It's been so long.
-Yeah.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.375
-Hang on, hurry!
-Yes.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.041
Oh, shit!

07:34.666 --> 07:36.125
-Kiss me!
-Yes.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.541
Look.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.416
Is this for the ritual?

07:44.500 --> 07:47.208
Yeah, I figured Gayusha
should feel at home.

07:47.291 --> 07:48.916
-But of course.
-Wait.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.041
There.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.583
That's pretty loud.

07:58.208 --> 08:01.708
Please let me get pregnant.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.416
-Okay. Come here.
-Yes.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.750
-Come here.
-I'm coming. Let me turn it down.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.416
-Hold on.
-Let me turn it down.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.916
-Baby, but come.
-Just a little.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.458
Come here, my love.

08:12.708 --> 08:14.166
-There.
-Yes.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.666
-I love you.
-Me too.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.458
Please let me get pregnant.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.583
I mean, this is…

08:24.916 --> 08:26.333
-We're beautiful.
-Well, yeah.

08:26.416 --> 08:27.375
We're hot.

08:27.458 --> 08:28.333
We're beautiful.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.541
The PR genius and the lady entrepreneur.

08:30.625 --> 08:31.833
The magical union.

08:36.875 --> 08:37.875
The winning duo.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
Hot.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.875
So hot.

08:41.958 --> 08:43.166
You're the one that's hot.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.500
-Glory.
-Beauty.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.125
-Money.
-Success.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.291
-Present.
-CAC 40.

08:49.375 --> 08:50.958
-Traveling.
-Usufruct.

08:51.041 --> 08:52.458
-No! Property!
-Property.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.708
-Vacation.
-Shit, I…

09:00.375 --> 09:01.708
He's a healthcare worker.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.750
Yeah, but the second lockdown
wiped him out. Burn out.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.583
But it's only natural.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.375
He hasn't gone back ever since.
He doesn't do anything.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.458
Unemployed.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.625
We don't have enough money
to rent a place in Paris.

09:17.708 --> 09:20.333
Good thing my grandmother
gave us her house.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.416
She's actually digging
the retirement home.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.000
She's complaining there aren't enough men.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.625
Because they die younger.

09:26.708 --> 09:29.833
Yep, because you guys die earlier.
Bet you didn't know that.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.333
So, meanwhile,

09:32.416 --> 09:34.875
we're stuck in the countryside,
freezing our asses off.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.541
That's normal. It's the basins.

09:45.916 --> 09:46.791
Fuck.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.375
That was good.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.000
Hi.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.375
Hi, Suzanne.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.333
You should have told me
you were dropping by.

10:04.416 --> 10:05.458
I have a lot of work.

10:05.541 --> 10:08.041
Well, I can drop by whenever I want.
It's my building.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.916
Well, my soon-to-be nightclub.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.750
Anyway, this is really helping out
the foundation, even if it's temporary.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.791
Suzanne. Look.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.791
I put your daddy here. On the shelf.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.208
In fact, I thought you might want
to think about planting him?

10:26.750 --> 10:30.833
No, because there's a cemetery--
well, more like a forest,

10:30.916 --> 10:33.875
where ashes are used to grow trees.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.083
Great.

10:35.166 --> 10:39.833
Elsa, honestly, do we really have
to do this dumb foundation thing?

10:39.916 --> 10:43.666
Can't we do something else?
Don't you want to find some other thing?

10:43.750 --> 10:47.375
We could create a brand of sweatshirts.
Or anal jewelry. Now that's awesome.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.583
Or even better,
socks with your dog's face on them.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.833
Right, but I don't have a dog.

10:52.916 --> 10:55.458
Who cares?
It's hot on Instagram right now.

10:55.541 --> 10:58.166
Then we collect the money
and give it to associations.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.458
Because honestly, Elsa,
I'm feeling oppressed.

11:00.541 --> 11:04.333
I've got this super annoying
charity thing with you in it.

11:05.250 --> 11:09.083
And I'm forced to do it.
Otherwise, I lose my inheritance.

11:09.166 --> 11:14.041
I understand. But what the foundation
really needs are women's projects.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.125
Yes, that's nice, Elsa. If by Monday,

11:16.208 --> 11:19.333
you don't have something sexy,
well, it's game over, you're fired.

11:19.416 --> 11:22.666
Suzanne, please, not Monday.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.416
Besides, the foundation
is here to help, not sell.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.958
Suzanne--

11:27.041 --> 11:27.875
Kisses. Bye.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.291
Come on, stop.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.041
Cha, come on.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.208
But we're here.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.541
Come on. Stop this.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.875
-That's your winning headquarters?
-Yes!

11:41.416 --> 11:42.291
Hang on. Look.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.666
-What are you doing?
-Wait. Don't move.

11:49.416 --> 11:51.583
Hang on. You won't believe it.

11:54.833 --> 11:55.875
Are you kidding?

11:57.333 --> 11:58.166
Come!

12:00.083 --> 12:01.333
Shit, this is-- Here.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.291
Campaign headquarters,
in the middle of the 9th district.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.416
Your kingdom awaits!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.958
-How much did you pay for this?
-A ton!

12:15.041 --> 12:16.500
But it's for a good cause.

12:16.583 --> 12:18.708
A ton? For this insalubrious place?

12:21.250 --> 12:23.250
There's gotta be asbestos here.

12:23.333 --> 12:26.458
More important,
there's room for the whole district!

12:26.541 --> 12:27.916
Something wrong, dickhead?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.208
Isn't this kind of big for him?

12:31.291 --> 12:33.708
-Chantal.
-Our campaign manager.

12:33.791 --> 12:36.500
No, hang on. We're paying her? To--

12:36.583 --> 12:38.166
Well, I'm paying her.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.666
Yeah, I would never work for you for free.

12:40.750 --> 12:44.250
-I know what you're like.
-Exactly. She knows everything about you.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.166
It's a win-win!

12:45.250 --> 12:46.708
Now, it's more of a "lose-lose."

12:46.791 --> 12:49.208
-I don't know if you've seen the polls.
-No.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.125
Yeah. Green party, 17%…

12:52.208 --> 12:53.625
Maxime Pauillac, two.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.333
-Two?
-Two.

12:56.416 --> 12:57.458
Okay…

12:57.541 --> 12:58.958
Hurts, doesn't it?

12:59.041 --> 13:00.083
Yeah, it's not…

13:00.666 --> 13:02.416
In the meantime, I got the posters.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.625
Okay. So wait. Okay. Wait.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.291
-What?
-Suspense.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.041
-Come on. Do it.
-Ready?

13:11.583 --> 13:12.791
THE TIME FOR NINE

13:12.875 --> 13:13.750
All right.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.208
Now I feel confident.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.250
Yeah, it's…

13:19.791 --> 13:20.916
It's great.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.416
-It's gorgeous. But…
-Killer.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
-But, I mean, I'm a little…
-What?

13:25.291 --> 13:26.416
…small.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
The printer said
this is what Maxime asked for.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.875
-No. It's not…
-This is kind of…

13:31.958 --> 13:35.291
If there's too much information on
a poster, the message gets muddled.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.083
And here, the message is me.

13:37.833 --> 13:40.958
And you. That's the message,
you and me, so it's us.

13:42.666 --> 13:46.416
Anyway, to kick the Green candidate's ass,
I had an idea, we'll add a tree.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.000
Or a flower. That's a good idea.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.791
ELSA
HELP!!! SHE WANTS TO FIRE ME!!!

13:49.875 --> 13:51.333
-Oh shit.
-Yeah, plants.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.458
I gotta go.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.333
Well, I'll let you get settled in,
dickhead and…

13:55.833 --> 13:57.333
Well, vaghead, I guess.

13:57.416 --> 13:58.458
Or a panda.

13:59.416 --> 14:00.833
Pandas are reassuring.

14:02.125 --> 14:03.791
Chantal!

14:04.916 --> 14:07.291
That whole "cum face" thing
was totally not true.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.500
His face, when he comes,
isn't like Elsa said.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.250
-Yes, it is.
-No, I swear!

14:11.333 --> 14:13.208
No. On the contrary. His face is very--

14:13.291 --> 14:14.791
-I'll call you.
-Very cute.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.666
Oh, shit!

14:16.750 --> 14:18.250
"My fellow French citizens…"

14:18.750 --> 14:20.375
The acoustics aren't that great.

14:20.458 --> 14:21.750
There's some crazy reverb.

14:21.833 --> 14:25.041
Actually, Charlotte got herself
trapped in this love story

14:25.125 --> 14:27.000
that doesn't suit her at all.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.583
But she doesn't see it.
We see it, of course, but…

14:29.666 --> 14:31.333
And since Max is Elsa's ex…

14:31.875 --> 14:35.125
No one wants to see them,
so the gang is cut in half.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.333
And since before-- I didn't tell you.

14:37.416 --> 14:38.583
Sorry, did I wake you?

14:38.666 --> 14:41.958
The thing is that Charlotte
used to date Matthieu in secret.

14:42.041 --> 14:45.375
Matthieu, another friend in the gang,
can you imagine? What a mess.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.791
What's the emergency, Elsa?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.166
I'm in deep shit, Chantal.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.708
I have to save the foundation
by Monday, or she'll fire me.

15:00.375 --> 15:01.458
Don't worry.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.791
We're going to blow Suzanne's mind.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.166
A clear project.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.208
Okay?

15:09.291 --> 15:10.125
A goal.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.708
I don't know, a…

15:13.791 --> 15:15.833
Shit. Oh, fuck.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.833
There's no place to sit here?

15:17.916 --> 15:20.083
A clear project. A goal.

15:20.625 --> 15:21.666
That's good.

15:25.041 --> 15:25.916
And a vision.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.875
-Yeah, a vision.
-What is your vision?

15:29.333 --> 15:32.291
Well, this morning,
I was walking down the street,

15:32.791 --> 15:35.416
and I thought to myself
that what really speaks to me

15:35.500 --> 15:37.666
is nature and women. Gaia.

15:37.750 --> 15:41.750
We've lost this fundamental connection
between the sacred earth and the feminine.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.083
Women. The earth.

15:44.708 --> 15:47.166
Two sisters who don't understand
each other anymore.

15:48.083 --> 15:48.916
You know?

15:49.666 --> 15:51.666
The reinsertion of women
by way of environmentalism.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.000
Shit, that's it. That's exactly it.
You're a genius!

15:56.791 --> 15:59.250
-Sorry.
-Do you have any projects that match that?

15:59.958 --> 16:00.791
Yes, actually.

16:00.875 --> 16:01.833
I have leads.

16:01.916 --> 16:02.750
Stop it.

16:02.833 --> 16:03.666
I have leads.

16:03.750 --> 16:07.500
Anyway, I called them in
to present their projects ASAP.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.708
However, you know,
I can't stay too late because I--

16:10.791 --> 16:13.500
Yes. You're in your fertility window.
You need to go fuck.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.041
Okay. Go.

16:16.416 --> 16:18.333
One of them is on her way.

16:18.416 --> 16:19.666
-Grab a seat.
-Great.

16:19.750 --> 16:23.083
And Elsa isn't interested in anything
apart from her uterus,

16:23.166 --> 16:24.708
so good luck with that.

16:24.791 --> 16:27.875
Because I tried to get them
to make up. I really did.

16:27.958 --> 16:29.166
But it was a total fail.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.166
This whole thing is just hell.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.416
There are so many flavors. It's delicious.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.333
Thanks.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.208
-You don't want any?
-No.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.000
Okay.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.500
So

16:40.833 --> 16:43.708
this is breast milk ice cream?

16:43.791 --> 16:44.958
Yes.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.458
So we're really talking about

16:47.666 --> 16:49.750
milk that

16:50.583 --> 16:52.541
came from ladies' breasts?

16:52.625 --> 16:53.791
-Yes.
-Yes.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.583
-Is it yours?
-Yes, absolutely.

16:56.625 --> 16:57.458
You can tell.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.250
It's from my first child,

16:59.333 --> 17:01.958
but I intend
to reach out to future mothers.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.666
-This is good.
-Thanks.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.708
What?

17:06.333 --> 17:07.750
It's organic, for one thing.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.416
When is the next one getting here?

17:11.208 --> 17:13.166
Shit, I forgot to tell you.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.458
Lunch with Milou
was almost like it was before.

17:15.541 --> 17:17.083
She likes me better than Elsa.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.541
-She even invited us over this weekend.
-Fuck.

17:19.625 --> 17:20.708
Don't worry. I said no.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.375
-We have the campaign.
-They just published a new poll.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.875
-Yeah?
-The Green Party is up to 18%.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.833
Did you talk about global warming
in your interview?

17:29.500 --> 17:30.708
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

17:30.791 --> 17:31.708
What did you say?

17:33.500 --> 17:34.833
I said that…

17:34.916 --> 17:35.833
What?

17:36.333 --> 17:38.958
I said that I've never been colder
than this winter.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.500
Shit. When are they
wrapping up the article?

17:42.375 --> 17:43.208
Sunday.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.625
So we have the weekend
to make people think you're a tofu eater.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.958
Yes, yes, I'm talking to you. Okay.

17:50.041 --> 17:53.750
What will we do?

17:53.833 --> 17:54.666
Yeah.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.583
I have a genius idea.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.958
She wants Parisians to dump
their compost in farmers' faces?

18:00.041 --> 18:02.666
-That's right.
-Why don't we throw them our poop too?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.291
You know what compost is?

18:06.291 --> 18:07.208
Yeah.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.166
What is it?

18:10.166 --> 18:12.375
Well, it's…

18:13.041 --> 18:15.166
It's…

18:15.250 --> 18:16.750
A tampon you plant?

18:16.833 --> 18:18.625
No. A vegetable tampatch.

18:18.708 --> 18:23.041
And inside, there's a little squash seed.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.083
And your period helps it germinate.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.250
And there's no risk of toxic shock?

18:27.333 --> 18:28.458
No, none at all.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.083
Wait, is there?

18:30.916 --> 18:33.708
Good thing I have my followers.
They're loyal, at least.

18:33.791 --> 18:35.791
Yes, because I have an Insta. See?

18:35.875 --> 18:38.375
If you want to follow me,
it's called Decountrymom.

18:38.875 --> 18:42.125
"Deco" as in "decorating."
"Country" as in, well, "countryside."

18:42.208 --> 18:43.916
And "Mom" as in "Mommy."

18:44.000 --> 18:48.500
"Mommy," not like a mummy.
Like "Mom," "Mommy," without… There.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.083
You can follow me if you like.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.166
NEW APPOINTMENT IN OISE
FOR WORK QUOTATION

18:58.250 --> 18:59.583
Finally, a construction site.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.541
Hi, you momtrepreneurs!

19:07.625 --> 19:09.416
Today, I'm meeting with Arnaud,

19:09.500 --> 19:12.875
who wants to entrust his living room
to Decountrymom's expert hands.

19:12.958 --> 19:14.333
-Hello, Arnaud!
-Hello.

19:14.416 --> 19:15.791
So tell us.

19:16.541 --> 19:19.000
What am I seeing here?

19:19.083 --> 19:20.958
This place needs a little freshening up!

19:21.041 --> 19:22.750
MUMTREPRENEUSE POWER!!
HI DECOUNTRYMOM

19:22.833 --> 19:24.041
Good thing I'm here.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.250
So, suspense, girls.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.916
See you again real soon
for an awesome before and after.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.375
See you. Kisses.

19:30.916 --> 19:31.791
There, that's done.

19:32.833 --> 19:36.500
So what are we aiming for?
An industrial look?

19:36.583 --> 19:38.541
Less boary?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.583
It's more of a clogged-toilet situation.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.875
Toilet-- But I'm not a plumber.
I'm an architect.

19:43.958 --> 19:46.583
-You're wearing a plumber's belt.
-It's an architect's belt.

19:46.666 --> 19:49.333
-On Insta, it says "all kinds of work."
-Architectural work.

19:49.416 --> 19:52.083
-What the hell am I doing here?
-What if I follow you?

19:53.583 --> 19:54.458
No.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.791
And if I tag you in a story?

19:58.708 --> 20:01.000
-Fine. Where's the toilet?
-This way.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.333
It's too bad. This really is very ugly.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.041
-And so, this is…
-A "One Old Woman Show."

20:10.125 --> 20:13.666
Yes, but for kids. And it talks about
the environment at one point.

20:14.625 --> 20:18.625
I thought it was a shame that kids
were left out by stand-up comics.

20:19.375 --> 20:24.083
Since they have a crappy sense of humor…
and so do I, it's a perfect match.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.666
But isn't the foundation
meant to support women?

20:30.375 --> 20:31.208
Chantal.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.708
-That's discriminatory.
-Yes, kind of.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.416
But, Roman, you're not a woman.
You're just dressed up as one.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.083
When's the next project getting here?

20:41.083 --> 20:42.541
There isn't a next one.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.708
-Can I begin?
-Sure, go ahead, Roman.

20:45.791 --> 20:46.833
-Sorry.
-Great.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.916
One, two, three, go for it.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.916
Hi, kiddos! It's Mrs. Doubtwater!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.833
And today,
we're going to be looking at apples.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.791
But careful. Make sure
you don't end up a bad one!

20:59.375 --> 21:00.583
A bad apple!

21:02.000 --> 21:02.916
-Elsa?
-Yes.

21:03.541 --> 21:05.208
-You're in deep shit.
-Yeah.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.416
Good thing we're together because

21:10.625 --> 21:13.208
my professional life is such shit.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.291
Tell me about it.

21:14.375 --> 21:16.750
The music label is putting
so much pressure on me.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.458
Sorry, this is all we had.

21:18.541 --> 21:19.666
A gherkin.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.333
I don't understand.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.375
You were happy.
You told me they were the best.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.416
The label is great, but the boss,

21:26.500 --> 21:28.125
he's too full of himself.

21:28.208 --> 21:31.041
He won't stop rushing me,
and I'm struggling.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.666
Nothing I do works.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.458
-And there's us.
-Yes.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.208
Maybe I should think
more about the future.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.833
Especially if we have a child.

21:39.375 --> 21:42.291
At least my father found
a better-paying job when I was born.

21:42.375 --> 21:43.875
But he never made music again.

21:44.958 --> 21:46.833
He blamed you for it his entire life.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.166
I don't know why
you're stressing out so much.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.708
We're doing great, aren't we?

21:53.208 --> 21:55.083
Who's that? Don't move. I'll be back.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.250
I'm not moving.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.583
-Yes?
-Yes, hello?

22:02.166 --> 22:03.916
Hello. Are you looking for someone?

22:04.000 --> 22:04.833
You are…

22:04.916 --> 22:06.458
We are Günther and Ludwig.

22:06.541 --> 22:08.250
-The new Airbnb renters.
-Yes.

22:08.333 --> 22:09.166
What?

22:09.250 --> 22:10.458
-I am Günther.
-Hello?

22:10.541 --> 22:12.208
Günther. Hang on two "minuten."

22:12.291 --> 22:13.666
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.333
We have a reservation.

22:15.416 --> 22:19.333
We made a mistake with the Airbnb dates.
It's 2/10, not 10/2.

22:19.416 --> 22:22.000
Does this mean
we sublet our place from today on?

22:22.083 --> 22:23.458
Yeah, for two months.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.041
There! Caught red-handed!

22:25.125 --> 22:27.916
You owe two months' rent,
and then you illegally sublet!

22:28.000 --> 22:29.125
What?

22:29.208 --> 22:30.375
-No.
-No.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.083
-I'm kicking you out.
-What?

22:32.166 --> 22:35.166
Yeah, I get it. It's no big deal, man.
See you. Ciao.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.291
We can't stay with Roman.

22:37.916 --> 22:40.500
-That only leaves your mother.
-Over my dead body.

22:41.041 --> 22:42.375
-It's just one night.
-No!

22:46.791 --> 22:47.666
DADDY IS UNEMPLOYED

22:47.750 --> 22:48.750
Fuck.

22:48.833 --> 22:49.833
What a shitty day.

22:50.416 --> 22:54.541
Stupid train. Stupid BFFs.
Fucking toilet. Hi.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.458
-Hi.
-Oh, fuck.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.000
-Hi.
-Hi?

23:00.750 --> 23:02.125
What's he doing here?

23:02.208 --> 23:04.708
Ever since Charlotte got with Max,
he's been down.

23:04.791 --> 23:06.708
And we're dancing the hokey pokey?

23:06.791 --> 23:10.166
-Can't he go be depressed elsewhere?
-It's just the weekend. I couldn't say no.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.583
You're sure Charlotte's not coming?
It would destroy him.

23:13.666 --> 23:15.666
I'm sure. Neither Charlotte nor Elsa.

23:15.750 --> 23:19.833
God knows I offered. I don't know why
nobody wants to come to the countryside.

23:19.916 --> 23:21.125
I really wonder why.

23:21.791 --> 23:24.333
What is it? Is it the neighbor again?

23:24.416 --> 23:27.833
The one who wants us to cut down trees
so he can have fiber Internet?

23:27.916 --> 23:29.291
Do we look like--

23:29.375 --> 23:30.250
Namaste!

23:30.333 --> 23:32.416
-What are you doing here?
-Namaste!

23:32.500 --> 23:34.625
Spontaneous change of plans.

23:34.708 --> 23:36.208
We're ovulating at your place!

23:36.291 --> 23:38.208
-Okay. All right.
-Yup, we're crazy.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.291
-What a big surprise.
-First time here.

23:41.166 --> 23:42.000
What's up?

23:44.875 --> 23:46.458
Surprise!

23:46.541 --> 23:48.833
We really felt like
visiting the countryside!

23:48.916 --> 23:50.500
Take a break from the campaign.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.958
Well, I think it's going to be
an awesome weekend.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.833
-Me too.
-Yes? Then say it.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.750
It's going to be an awesome weekend.

24:19.833 --> 24:20.875
-There you go.
-Yeah.
