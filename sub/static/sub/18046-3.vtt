01:39.016 --> 01:40.684
Do you know who this belongs to?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.063
Do you?

01:50.193 --> 01:51.028
Answer me!

01:53.113 --> 01:54.031
It's mine.

01:58.785 --> 02:02.998
I don't think Gerson would agree.
Do you know Gerson?

02:07.419 --> 02:08.711
I don't think she's met Gerson.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.507
Do you know what we do...

02:13.425 --> 02:15.135
to people who try to steal from Gerson?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.264
On the ground!

02:19.389 --> 02:20.223
Let's go.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.101
Fuck.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.813
-Let go!
-Oh, being so brave. Go on.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
I know what we're gonna do with you.

02:32.069 --> 02:32.903
Let her go.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.407
Next time you'll know better, bitch.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.328
Let's go!

A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:58.613 --> 04:01.616
CHAPTER 03
CORRIDOR

04:07.622 --> 04:08.498
Nair?

04:09.666 --> 04:10.959
<i>Listen to me.</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:12.627
<i>You need to be careful.</i>

04:12.711 --> 04:15.172
<i>Aline was sent by Councilor Matheus.</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:18.884
-So, they're coming after me.
-<i>They all share the same ideas.</i>

04:18.966 --> 04:21.845
<i>Increased transparency, an easier Process.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.389
<i>If they find one shred of evidence</i>
<i>against you...</i>

04:25.307 --> 04:26.933
<i>my vote will count for nothing.</i>

04:27.017 --> 04:28.643
I have nothing to hide.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.235
I wonder how long
they're gonna make us wait.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.321
Until we die from anxiety.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.620
Oh, damn.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.122
My bad, it's a close match.

04:49.206 --> 04:53.251
Yeah. We're doing our own test
to see who can get it in the pipe.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.297
Knock it off
before you get us all in trouble.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.674
Where's your competitive spirit?

05:00.926 --> 05:02.803
-Let us try.
-It's our turn.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.221
Step behind the line.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.222
Watch out for the...

05:05.722 --> 05:06.890
-What?
-The chair.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.477
-My turn.
-No.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.647
Here's the deal:
if Fernando gets it in on the first try,

05:13.730 --> 05:15.649
I'll give him my spot on the Offshore.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.235
-Then watch closely, douchebag.
-Go on.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.152
Watch.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.447
-Ow, fuck!
-Suck it!

05:23.073 --> 05:23.990
Nice!

05:26.493 --> 05:27.828
Idiot.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.958
Now you have to give me your spot.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.463
That's if you even pass.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.007
Think you're pretty tough, don't you?

05:42.634 --> 05:46.054
I have great aim,
but I'm not a great person.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.597
Watch yourself.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.385
Come in, Cássia.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.889
Oh, it's you.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.767
The next test just started.
May I watch it with you?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.603
-Of course.
-Thank you.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.273
Look.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.358
They were eliminated.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.739
Did you see she pissed herself?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.990
What happened?

06:50.660 --> 06:54.664
-Do you think they wash these clothes?
-That's what you're worried about?

07:06.801 --> 07:08.053
Hello, candidates.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.848
I hope you're happy
with the people in your group.

07:11.932 --> 07:16.186
After all, you did choose which candidate
to eliminate in the last test, right?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.145
More or less.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.731
-What's the test?
-It's simple.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.318
All you have to do
is cross the tunnel as a group.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.737
-Ready?
-Let's go.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.992
Sorry, we just have to cross the tunnel?
That's all?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.578
What's inside? An alligator?

07:33.912 --> 07:34.746
Go.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.666
You have five minutes.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.918
-How long is the tunnel?
-Good luck.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.139
Let's just move forward as a group.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.774
Come on, follow me.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.537
Guys...

08:16.913 --> 08:18.415
do you hear that hissing noise?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.794
Why did you kill Bruna?

08:23.962 --> 08:26.840
-What did you say?
-I didn't say anything, Michele.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.345
Guys, hold on.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.015
Less than a minute in
and the chicks are losing it.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.642
Guys, listen up.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.562
This is just a dark tunnel. That's all.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.813
Let's stick together.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.982
Sorry.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.942
If you touch me again, I'll turn you in.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.652
Fucking cheater.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.740
Slow and steady, guys.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.703
At this rate, we'll never make it across.
I'll go first. Excuse me.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.561
There's no "other side of the tunnel."
They're gonna kill us!

09:26.399 --> 09:29.069
What is this test about?
What's the concept?

09:29.152 --> 09:31.488
We release an odorless gas into the tunnel

09:31.571 --> 09:34.282
which has a profound effect
on the brain's occipital lobe.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.117
-Hence the hallucinations.
-Yes.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.453
In order to be worthy of joining us,

09:38.536 --> 09:41.998
they have to leave fear
and paranoia behind.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.669
We have to move faster.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.339
<i>-You're no good, Joana.</i>
<i>-You shouldn't have stolen from Gerson.</i>

09:49.422 --> 09:51.758
We need to get across
before something bad happens.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.511
-You're no good, Joana.
-How can you live with yourself?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.262
How can you sleep at night
after what you did?

09:56.346 --> 09:59.057
<i>If you go back,</i>
<i>Gerson will kill you, Joana.</i>

09:59.641 --> 10:02.811
<i>-His most precious thing.</i>
<i>-You're a murderer.</i>

10:02.894 --> 10:03.853
<i>Murderer.</i>

10:06.022 --> 10:08.983
<i>How can you sleep at night</i>
<i>knowing what you've done?</i>

10:09.067 --> 10:10.610
<i>You are a horrible person.</i>

10:10.693 --> 10:12.320
<i>It won't change what you did.</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:14.989
Let me out of here!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.201
I crossed the tunnel! I need to get out!

10:19.244 --> 10:23.873
<i>This is a group test, candidate.</i>
<i>You only pass if the entire group passes.</i>

10:33.383 --> 10:36.302
<i>You're no good, Joana.</i>
<i>You are a horrible person.</i>

10:37.637 --> 10:39.055
<i>...will kill you.</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:41.474
<i>His most precious thing.</i>

10:43.059 --> 10:45.812
<i>Running away won't change anything.</i>
<i>You're a murderer!</i>

10:45.895 --> 10:48.064
<i>You are a horrible person.</i>

10:50.650 --> 10:54.112
-Joana, where were you?
-Negotiating your surrender, Rafael.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.613
-What?
-Come with me.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.283
That's a lie.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.618
There's a traitor in our group.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.663
There's a traitor in the group.
There's a traitor here.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.622
Hello, Michele.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.585
What's wrong?
Isn't this what you came for?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.879
To kill me? I deserve it.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.298
You killed him.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.764
<i>You're no good, Joana.</i>
<i>You're a horrible person.</i>

11:21.848 --> 11:23.057
It's some kind of gas!

11:23.141 --> 11:24.017
<i>Who are you?</i>

11:25.560 --> 11:27.854
What you're hearing or seeing,
it's the gas!

11:27.937 --> 11:29.355
You're an embarrassment to your family.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.858
-We have to keep moving!
-I don't think he's an Álvares.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.068
-Shut up!
-You can argue at the other end.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.486
Let's go!

11:36.154 --> 11:37.113
Go!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.080
Come on, Ágata, let's go!

11:48.583 --> 11:51.878
She's gonna kill us. She's gonna kill us.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.350
Only one left.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.314
<i>Running away won't change</i>
<i>what you've done. You're a murderer!</i>

12:13.024 --> 12:14.525
-Come on!
-Keep your hands off me.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.778
-Come with me!
-Don't touch me!

12:16.861 --> 12:19.489
Do you know what we do
with traitors around here?

12:19.572 --> 12:20.823
I just did what I had to do!

12:20.907 --> 12:23.034
Rafael, you need to stop
breathing the gas.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.417
<i>-Murderer. You're a murderer!</i>
<i>-Murderer.</i>

12:31.501 --> 12:32.669
Shut up!

12:36.839 --> 12:40.927
Rafael... forget what you're seeing
and what you're hearing,

12:41.010 --> 12:42.679
and come with me.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.681
Let's go! Trust me! Let's get out of here.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.570
Now, guys! Come on!

13:16.421 --> 13:17.380
Congratulations.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.675
The effects of the hormones in the gas
will wear off soon.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.220
You will now be directed to the dorms.
This way, please.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.603
Ágata, it's over. Come with me.

13:42.572 --> 13:47.535
Cássia, I want you to find out everything
you can about this candidate, okay?

13:48.953 --> 13:51.039
I'm not sure about this test.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.835
I don't know if it's selecting
who we need for the Offshore.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.048
What about these plants, huh?

14:02.925 --> 14:04.802
Who picked these for you?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.512
Why couldn't I have picked them myself?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.014
Of course.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.143
Your office...
you have no pictures in here.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.313
No, I don't.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.484
Not even of Julia, your wife?

14:20.276 --> 14:21.152
No.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.946
Do you have any other comments?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.915
This is where you'll be sleeping.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.926
I can't believe I lost it in there.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.303
I swear it won't happen again.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.599
Lucky for us it was you and not Lucas.
Or we'd be gone.

14:51.682 --> 14:52.850
What about you?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.018
What did you see?

14:54.685 --> 14:55.645
Nothing.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.564
Right. You don't have to trust me.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.608
Just go it alone.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.418
They're making us sleep
in the engine room.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.753
Because where you slept before
was so much better.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.221
Ágata, relax. The test is over.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.848
-It's over.
-Here.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.599
She's been like this since the test.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.274
It's nothing to worry about.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.025
Give her time.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.445
The effects will wear off
after a good night's sleep.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.990
-No, I think she's having--
-We've done this test before.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.784
If she passed, she has to stay.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.328
But wait!
You're not going to do anything?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.082
Don't worry. He's an Offshore agent.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.252
-He knows what he's doing.
-I don't know.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.255
Maybe the gas is still wearing off,
but I feel kind of...

16:04.755 --> 16:06.090
I know. It was horrible.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.509
Michele, what did you see?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.638
I thought I heard you say something
about your brother.

16:14.432 --> 16:20.938
Okay. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to pry or anything.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.231
I just want you to know--

16:30.364 --> 16:32.909
-I'm sorry.
-No.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.684
All eliminated candidates
have been escorted out.

16:58.768 --> 16:59.769
Okay.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.314
Except one who tried to sneak back
through the gate.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.107
Really? That's funny.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.112
Where was Aline going
with those questions?

17:10.195 --> 17:13.199
-She's just trying to throw me off.
-Know what I was thinking?

17:13.281 --> 17:17.912
Imagine if they put you, me, Aline,
and the Council members in the tunnel.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.789
Think we would pass?

17:19.872 --> 17:23.459
We're not here
to discuss hypotheses, okay?

17:24.042 --> 17:27.964
It's no wonder Aline is intrigued
by your personality, you know?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.550
Cássia, I have a Process to run.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.304
I don't have time to joke around
or answer Aline's questions.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.489
Of course you passed.
Marco was leading your group.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.367
Who? Pretty boy over here?

17:56.826 --> 17:57.994
He totally lost it.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.454
You're telling me
Marco didn't lead you guys through?

18:03.541 --> 18:04.792
It was Joana.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.378
And he was the last one out.
Almost fucked everyone over.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.715
So what? Maybe it's because
I have a lot going on in my head.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.134
-It's called being profound.
-Right.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.093
Sorry.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.512
Do you think it'll be worth it?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.430
What?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.639
Passing.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.351
Of course.
Anything is better than this hellhole.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.396
Where do you want your kids
to grow up?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.524
Inland? Or the Offshore?

18:28.608 --> 18:32.612
-You want to have kids?
-Sure I do. Why not?

18:32.695 --> 18:33.988
Those poor kids.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.201
No one really knows
what it's like over there.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.997
If there's a lot of green,
surrounded by nature.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.750
They're advanced. If they don't
need plants, they won't have them.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.795
The Offshore has a gigantic greenhouse.
They harvest everything they plant.

18:49.879 --> 18:55.301
When I was younger,
I pictured a place in the clouds.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.803
I know the greenhouse is for real.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.765
My grandma was a second cousin
to the Founding Couple.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.893
You know a lot of people
claim that, right?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.520
She's the one who started building
the underground railroad!

19:06.604 --> 19:08.439
Sure, the tunnel... No.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.526
What do you mean?
It runs between the lake--

19:12.610 --> 19:14.612
Between the dried-up lake
and the landfill.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.614
Right.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.658
I know. It's run by militia.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.660
Oh, yeah?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.580
Is that what you hallucinated about?

19:25.748 --> 19:28.751
No. I didn't see anything.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.336
So, you're immune to the gas?

19:30.419 --> 19:34.715
Either that or you have nothing
in your head to hallucinate about.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.594
No fears, no regrets, no guilt?
Impossible.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.274
-What about that guy we killed yesterday?
-The one we beat to death.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.777
And now they wanna fuck up my house?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.196
The place where I raise my son?
Are they crazy?

19:57.279 --> 19:58.948
Let's go sort this shit out.

22:51.870 --> 22:52.913
I'm sorry.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.416
I didn't mean to...

23:03.173 --> 23:04.049
Die!

23:12.266 --> 23:13.267
Die!

23:15.477 --> 23:17.313
Stop, Ágata! Let her go!

23:17.396 --> 23:19.732
She's gonna kill us all! In the middle
of the night while we're sleeping!

23:19.815 --> 23:23.277
-She won't, Ágata. Trust me!
-She will!

23:23.360 --> 23:24.278
Everything is okay.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.571
-No!
-It's okay.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.948
Everything is fine. Trust me.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.618
Trust me. It's okay.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.605
Cássia, I'm already fixing the alarm.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.191
No, it went off by accident.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.526
I'll call you back.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.075
What are you doing here?

24:12.034 --> 24:14.453
I'm hungry.

24:17.039 --> 24:17.873
Come here.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.351
Wash your hands.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.687
Wash them like you mean it.

24:40.896 --> 24:41.980
That's it.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.816
Dry them quickly.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.442
Quick!

25:05.838 --> 25:07.005
Eat with your hands.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.258
I'm eating with my hands, too.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.976
Hey... Augusto.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.647
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

25:28.861 --> 25:32.031
I couldn't go see you
because things are difficult here.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.826
Someone has been watching me.
I'm being watched.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.370
Do you understand?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.292
Listen to me.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.675
I might not be able to see you
as often as before.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.928
Things have changed around here.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.017
Answer me. Do you understand?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.060
I understand.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.272
Are you still hungry?

26:06.440 --> 26:07.316
Yes.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.110
Do you want my plate?

26:11.236 --> 26:12.237
Okay.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.038
I have a gift for you.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.169
Here.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.221
Here!

27:20.472 --> 27:22.808
Hey! What's going on?

27:22.891 --> 27:23.725
Help me.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.935
-What?
-I fucked up.

27:25.978 --> 27:26.979
You fucked up...

27:27.688 --> 27:29.356
What happened? Tell me.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.901
Do you still work with registrations?

27:33.944 --> 27:36.405
You were never registered?

27:39.366 --> 27:41.910
No. When there's no one
to take care of you,

27:41.994 --> 27:44.037
no one registers you either.

27:44.746 --> 27:45.873
Well...

27:46.915 --> 27:48.792
it can be done, but it's not...

27:50.085 --> 27:51.962
it's not that simple.

27:52.045 --> 27:56.508
I mean, it's not just,
"Take this, implant it, and done."

27:56.592 --> 27:58.177
They're going to kill me, Valéria.

27:59.469 --> 28:00.304
Or worse.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.649
Come. Come with me.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.487
Lie down.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.617
I'm gonna show you
how it all goes down.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.952
Look at this. This is a piece of liver.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.370
The registration is right here.

28:25.454 --> 28:30.334
The registration needs to stay in contact
with living cells, otherwise it turns off.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.044
Now...

28:33.629 --> 28:35.714
are you gonna tell me what's happening,

28:35.797 --> 28:37.799
or are you gonna keep me in the dark?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.478
NO RECORD

28:52.022 --> 28:53.315
Flip over on your side.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.318
It's going to be quick
and it won't hurt too much.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.236
Just a little.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.113
So many want
to go through the Process

29:00.197 --> 29:02.783
and you're trying to use it
so you can disappear.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.265
"Joana"?

29:26.348 --> 29:30.602
The name of the registration's owner.
The poor soul who died.

29:30.686 --> 29:34.815
No! You have to stay and rest
for at least a few hours.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.817
Thank you, Valéria.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.413
<i>-Gerson's son was killed.</i>
<i>-It was that girl.</i>

29:49.830 --> 29:51.415
<i>The lonely one.</i>

29:53.625 --> 29:55.585
<i>Know what we do to people</i>
<i>who steal from Gerson?</i>

29:55.669 --> 29:58.672
<i>There's a reward.</i>
<i>Do you know where she is?</i>

29:58.755 --> 30:01.591
<i>-Didn't you know her, Valéria?</i>
<i>-No, I don't know her.</i>

30:01.675 --> 30:03.677
<i>-You're a murderer.</i>
<i>-Murderer!</i>

30:09.891 --> 30:11.727
-How long was I--?
-Was it you?

30:13.020 --> 30:15.814
-What?
-Who killed his son.

30:19.151 --> 30:23.071
Gerson's already set a bounty
for the man who killed his son.

30:23.739 --> 30:24.865
Or woman.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.659
I didn't mean to get you involved.

30:27.743 --> 30:31.163
How could you do that? He was a child.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.542
I won't tell anyone that you helped me.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.753
I will know that I helped you! Get it?

30:41.214 --> 30:45.594
Now I know who you truly are.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.637
It was an accident.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.056
Get out.

30:51.725 --> 30:52.851
Get out of here!

30:53.560 --> 30:54.519
Right now!

31:29.721 --> 31:30.972
Ágata fell sleep.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.143
The gas took a toll on her. Poor thing.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.813
Are you feeling better?

31:42.275 --> 31:44.528
You don't have to talk to me.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.572
I just saved your life.
But what's a life, right?

31:48.782 --> 31:52.077
"Thanks, Rafael."
"No problem, Joana. You're welcome."

31:59.543 --> 32:02.254
I saw a kid. During the test.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.215
Then he was here in the corridor.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.969
Maybe the gas had a delayed effect on you.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.722
I know what I saw.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.352
I know what I did.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.624
You're not a bad person, Joana.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.710
What do you think you know about me?

32:41.793 --> 32:44.379
I don't really know... anything.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.048
But I feel it.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.093
You saved me in that test.

32:52.721 --> 32:57.601
I think that you blackmailed
your way into an alliance.

32:58.101 --> 33:01.897
But after today, I think we could...
extend that alliance.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.148
What do you think?

33:05.192 --> 33:07.986
Joana, I know you won't turn me in.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.200
Especially since I can turn you in, too.

33:18.747 --> 33:19.623
Joana...

33:20.749 --> 33:25.212
we may have gotten where we are
doing things the wrong way...

33:27.547 --> 33:29.466
but I believe we're doing
the right thing now.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.177
In our own way.

33:33.929 --> 33:38.558
I don't know what you did
or what you saw in the tunnel.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.185
I don't give a fuck.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.062
I don't wanna know.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.317
I know, I feel...

33:47.943 --> 33:49.444
that you're a good person.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.199
You're the only one who doubts that.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.086
Here.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.101
Ezequiel?

34:25.605 --> 34:27.399
Stay here. Be quiet.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.114
I saw your light was on. May I come in?

34:35.447 --> 34:36.283
Of course.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.661
I didn't realize you were having dinner.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.331
Yes, once in a while I get hungry.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.043
Did you have company?

34:50.088 --> 34:53.091
Is that your final question
or are you just getting started?

34:55.594 --> 34:56.428
Aline...

34:57.387 --> 35:00.682
-let's put an end to this.
-There's no interrogation.

35:01.683 --> 35:05.145
I know very well why you are here

35:05.228 --> 35:06.980
and who sent you.

35:09.149 --> 35:09.983
The Council.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.651
Oh, the Council.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.486
I know exactly...

35:14.487 --> 35:16.114
who from the Council sent you.

35:17.032 --> 35:17.991
And why.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.912
The good thing about our society,
the beauty of it...

35:23.413 --> 35:25.582
is that each one of us made it
through the Process.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.960
You simply check anyone's ID
and their registration

35:29.044 --> 35:31.004
to find out exactly who they are.

35:31.087 --> 35:35.133
And there's no room for lies.
Or secrets.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.556
-But for now, I'll let you relax.
-Thank you.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.102
And, please, just one last question.

35:46.186 --> 35:50.273
Is it common for anyone to leave
the building during the Process?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.611
No. That doesn't happen.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.488
Okay.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.285
Good night, Ezequiel.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.128
I have to get you out of here right now.

36:16.716 --> 36:17.550
Where is it?

36:27.602 --> 36:28.436
Listen...

36:29.270 --> 36:31.189
I meant what I said, okay?

36:31.272 --> 36:32.982
You can never come here again.

36:34.442 --> 36:35.276
Never.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.033
Go.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.598
You should be sleeping.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.517
I can't.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.645
Are you worried?

37:11.438 --> 37:12.689
Thinking about stupid stuff.

37:14.441 --> 37:15.567
Not that.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.111
For a minute,
I could see myself on the Offshore.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.279
That's not stupid.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.948
And you were there with me.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.043
We're here to pass the Process.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.381
-We can't get distracted.
-Yes, of course.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.095
-Do you understand?
-Yes. I was gonna say the same thing.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.103
Not that I didn't like it.

37:53.563 --> 37:58.485
It was probably just the gas talking.
It probably made us a little high.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.612
Totally. It was probably the gas.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.199
Probably.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.494
-Good night.
-Good night.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.236
What's up?

38:43.530 --> 38:44.405
Thank you.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.113
What's up, Joana?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.949
How long has it been? Is it daytime yet?

40:10.033 --> 40:12.869
-This wall wasn't here before.
-Are you sure?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.914
Yes. We came in through here yesterday.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.258
Wake up!

40:27.342 --> 40:28.468
Everyone, wake up!

40:28.885 --> 40:31.763
Listen, they blocked the exit.
We're trapped in here.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.165
Hey!

41:00.333 --> 41:01.584
Is anybody out there?

42:15.908 --> 42:17.910
