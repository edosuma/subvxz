<i>Previously on Switched at Birth... </i>

00:01.976 --> 00:04.340
I vandalized the construction site.

00:04.365 --> 00:06.066
Wait a second, she took the blame for you?

00:06.100 --> 00:07.434
We can't tell anyone about this.

00:07.468 --> 00:09.169
This cannot get out.

00:09.203 --> 00:11.505
- Grandma!
- Cookie! Aw!

00:11.539 --> 00:13.507
Every time grandma comes
here, you get crazy.

00:13.541 --> 00:17.377
That's because some of us still
care about what our mothers think.

00:17.411 --> 00:19.468
Tank should have walked away.

00:19.469 --> 00:21.419
Us sleeping together
should have never happened.

00:21.425 --> 00:23.426
Are you saying that it was not consensual?

all the way out here again.

00:58.496 --> 01:00.056

01:00.697 --> 01:02.298
What about school?

01:04.699 --> 01:07.804

- It's okay.

01:12.543 --> 01:15.278
How could you have known?

01:15.579 --> 01:17.037
_

01:17.281 --> 01:19.282
You're here now,

01:19.316 --> 01:21.684
and...

01:21.719 --> 01:24.554
I want to tell you everything, so...

01:24.855 --> 01:27.970

01:27.991 --> 01:29.659

02:03.694 --> 02:05.662
Someone slept in.

02:05.696 --> 02:09.399
My own bed, a room to myself...

02:09.433 --> 02:12.335
I feel like Kate Middleton right now.

02:12.369 --> 02:14.270
I love fall break.

02:14.305 --> 02:16.239
Well, those of us who aren't royalty

02:16.273 --> 02:17.407
still have to go to work.

02:17.441 --> 02:20.410
I'm late to meet Eric, so I've got to run.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.579
I can't believe I haven't
seen the coffee house yet.

02:22.613 --> 02:24.581
I know. We're almost ready to open.

02:24.615 --> 02:26.583
Eric and I are so excited.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.685
This job sounds like it's going great.

02:28.719 --> 02:30.720
Well, it's kind of evolved.

02:30.754 --> 02:32.689
It's a little more than just design work.

02:32.723 --> 02:34.557
What do you mean?

02:34.592 --> 02:37.260
I made an investment in the coffee house.

02:37.294 --> 02:38.394
I'm part owner.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.597
Wow.

02:40.631 --> 02:43.499
How much did you invest?

02:43.534 --> 02:45.535
About 50 grand.

02:46.670 --> 02:49.305
- Mom!
- I know, I know.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.740
It's always a little
scary with a start-up,

02:50.774 --> 02:53.676
but East Riverside really
needs a place like this.

02:53.711 --> 02:55.678
I think it's gonna do really well.

02:55.713 --> 02:58.448
Why didn't you tell me?

02:58.482 --> 03:00.383
You were so busy with school.

03:00.417 --> 03:01.584
That's a lot of money.

03:01.619 --> 03:04.254
You are gonna love it.

03:04.288 --> 03:05.655
I can't wait till you see what we've done.

03:07.391 --> 03:09.225
Bye.

03:10.361 --> 03:12.362
One of the strongest storms on record

03:12.396 --> 03:14.230
is set to move into K.C. today,

03:14.265 --> 03:16.366
bringing with it strong
winds, golf-ball sized hail...

03:16.400 --> 03:18.601
- John: Wow.
- ... And heavy rainfall.

03:18.636 --> 03:22.272
The rain has already begun falling
north of the metropolitan area.

03:22.306 --> 03:24.374
My mother has to visit during a storm.

03:24.408 --> 03:27.377
Terrible weather and hurricane Bonnie.

03:27.411 --> 03:29.379
She gets critical when she's unhappy.

03:29.413 --> 03:31.614
And she's pretty much always unhappy.

03:32.716 --> 03:35.285
So is Emmett still around?

03:35.319 --> 03:36.619
They're in Bay's room.

03:36.654 --> 03:39.455
I think they've been up there all night.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.523
Excuse me?

03:40.557 --> 03:44.260
Come on, they have a lot to talk about.

03:45.396 --> 03:49.299
(Typing)

03:51.402 --> 03:52.402
Hmm?

03:52.603 --> 03:56.922
_

03:57.308 --> 03:58.441
Mmm.

04:01.342 --> 04:05.207
_

04:06.216 --> 04:10.286
Emmett, I think we're skipping a step here.

04:10.321 --> 04:12.322
I...

04:12.356 --> 04:16.659
we need to talk about what happened.

04:16.694 --> 04:20.329
We can't just move past
it like everything's okay.

04:20.363 --> 04:23.399
I'm not going to be
ready to talk about L.A.

04:23.434 --> 04:24.634
until we do.

04:24.835 --> 04:26.445
_

04:26.446 --> 04:29.069
_

04:29.306 --> 04:32.241
No, I'm not saying that. I just...

04:33.510 --> 04:35.244
I just want to talk.

04:36.645 --> 04:39.810
_

04:40.611 --> 04:42.113
_

04:42.514 --> 04:44.319
_

04:44.321 --> 04:47.423
Emmett, it is not that simple. I...

04:47.424 --> 04:52.780
_

04:52.783 --> 04:53.496
Emmett.

04:53.497 --> 04:57.450
_

04:57.451 --> 05:02.040
_

05:02.056 --> 05:04.307
Emmett!

<i>Eric: Listen to your
babysitter. All right, be safe</i>

05:08.512 --> 05:10.513
out there in the galaxy, star-lord.

05:10.547 --> 05:12.615
Okay, buddy, let's go over our checklist.

05:12.649 --> 05:14.417
- Money.
- Check.

05:14.451 --> 05:16.252
- Cellphone.
- Check.

05:16.286 --> 05:17.487
Hat.

05:18.689 --> 05:20.490
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

05:20.524 --> 05:22.592
- (Laughs) Check.
- Check.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.327
You're all set. Give me a pound, dude.

05:24.361 --> 05:25.595
Give me a pound, Regina.

05:25.629 --> 05:28.364
Oh, there you go.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.366
- Not too much junk food at the movie, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.368
All right, have a good time
with your friends. Be safe.

05:32.403 --> 05:34.337
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:34.371 --> 05:35.605
- He likes you.
- (Door bells jingle)

05:35.939 --> 05:38.574
Usually with all of our moving around,

05:38.609 --> 05:40.443
he's a lot more shy at first.

05:40.477 --> 05:42.545
Mmm. Well, he is a great kid.

05:42.579 --> 05:44.414
Mmm, I'm trying.

05:44.504 --> 05:48.574
You know, I think this is the most happy

05:48.608 --> 05:50.742
I have been about work in a long time.

05:50.777 --> 05:53.745
Mmm. I'm happy, too.

05:58.384 --> 06:00.486
(Door bells jingle)

06:04.457 --> 06:06.291
Mom?

06:06.326 --> 06:07.593
Hi.

06:07.627 --> 06:10.462
Daphne, this is Eric.

06:10.497 --> 06:13.499
Eric, this is my daughter Daphne.

06:13.533 --> 06:15.334
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:15.368 --> 06:17.436
Nice to meet you, too.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.740
(Doorbell rings)

06:21.774 --> 06:23.575
- Here we go.
- Yup.

06:23.610 --> 06:26.278
Oh! It is really coming down out here.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.514
I brought my friend Lucille.

06:28.548 --> 06:30.582
Ah! Thanks for having me.

06:30.617 --> 06:32.351
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:32.385 --> 06:33.452
So nice to meet you. Really.

06:33.486 --> 06:34.686
I'm sorry. I'm Kathryn.

06:34.721 --> 06:36.722
- This is my husband John.
- Hi, nice to see you.

06:38.424 --> 06:40.359
- Please, please!
- Oh, come on in.

06:40.393 --> 06:41.593
- Sorry!
- Let me grab that.

06:41.628 --> 06:42.761
- Thank you.
- Very much.

06:42.795 --> 06:44.530
Lucille is from Texas,

06:44.564 --> 06:46.431
and she has never been to Kansas,

06:46.466 --> 06:48.500
so I figure we have to give her a steak.

06:48.535 --> 06:51.470
We have fajitas and everything
in Scottsdale, but oh my god.

06:51.504 --> 06:54.473
Of course, the barbeque in
Scottsdale is definitely lacking.

06:54.507 --> 06:56.408
What part of Texas are you from, Lucille?

06:56.442 --> 06:57.643
I'm from Dallas.

06:57.677 --> 06:59.611
Yeah, she's practically got
the flag tattooed on her ankle.

06:59.646 --> 07:01.413
(All laughing)

07:01.447 --> 07:02.581
Hey, grandma.

07:02.615 --> 07:05.450
- Hi.
- Hey, cookie!

07:05.485 --> 07:07.319
How's my little jailbird?

07:07.353 --> 07:12.291
You know, just trying to
avoid my second felony.

07:12.325 --> 07:14.493
Yeah, well, probation seems to suit you.

07:14.527 --> 07:17.596
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh!

07:17.630 --> 07:20.566
Thanks, grandma. I... hi!

07:20.600 --> 07:22.601
I'm Bay! Uh...

07:22.635 --> 07:25.470
- I've heard so much about you!
- Oh!

07:25.505 --> 07:28.473
- I'm Lucille.
- Bay: Oh! Okay.

07:28.508 --> 07:31.543
Uh, this is my boyfriend Emmett.

07:31.578 --> 07:34.613
- Emmett, this is Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

07:34.647 --> 07:36.715
- Look at you with the signing.
- Sign language? Mom!

07:36.749 --> 07:39.618
- Yeah, well...
- When I found out that Bonnie

07:39.652 --> 07:42.521
had a deaf granddaughter
and didn't know how to sign,

07:42.555 --> 07:44.356
- I said...
- Well, we had to learn A.S.L.,

07:44.390 --> 07:46.491
- so we took a class.
- Lucille: I'm not as good as Bonnie.

07:46.526 --> 07:48.527
Well, I was a little reluctant, you know.

07:48.561 --> 07:50.562
But it ended up being so much fun.

07:50.597 --> 07:52.564
- Wait...
- Oh, "fun."

07:52.599 --> 07:54.633
- That's great.
- You know what?

07:54.667 --> 07:57.302
Let's help these guys.
Ladies, let me get you settled.

07:59.339 --> 08:00.339
Here you go.

08:00.373 --> 08:02.407
- Thank you.
- John: Oh, sure. After you.

08:02.442 --> 08:05.310
After you. Excellent.

08:05.345 --> 08:07.346
Were those cowboy boots she was wearing?

08:09.415 --> 08:12.384
(Thunder rumbling)

08:14.287 --> 08:16.622
- I gotta make a call.
- Okay.

08:19.292 --> 08:21.460
Because I don't even know
what it is yet, exactly,

08:21.494 --> 08:22.728
so it's hard to talk about.

08:22.762 --> 08:25.664
After what happened with Wes...

08:25.698 --> 08:29.301
Wes and I were not involved,
that was just business.

08:29.335 --> 08:30.736
Oh, please, he liked you.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.703
And he took advantage of you,

08:32.739 --> 08:34.573
and then everything spun out of control.

08:34.607 --> 08:36.408
This is gonna be fine.

08:36.442 --> 08:38.644
But it's a lot of your own money.

08:38.678 --> 08:41.413
I am a businesswoman. This
is a great opportunity.

08:41.447 --> 08:42.614
I know what I'm doing.

08:50.813 --> 08:52.714
You want them to really hear you?

08:53.549 --> 08:57.586
Sometimes you gotta shout!

08:57.620 --> 08:59.488
(Both laughing)

08:59.522 --> 09:01.656
Hi.

09:01.691 --> 09:04.393
Hi.

09:09.993 --> 09:13.963
Ah, there he is. Hey,
what was your name again?

09:13.997 --> 09:16.265
- Nacho.
- Well, Nacho is here

09:16.299 --> 09:18.367
to get our wi-fi up and
running on the cheap.

09:18.401 --> 09:20.135
Thanks for coming out in the rain, my man.

09:20.170 --> 09:21.937
Mm-hmm.

09:21.972 --> 09:24.907
And this is the co-owner
of the cafe, Regina,

09:24.941 --> 09:26.175
and her daughter Daphne.

09:26.209 --> 09:27.309
Yeah, I know.

09:27.344 --> 09:28.344
You guys know each other?

09:28.378 --> 09:31.180
Nacho: Just from around.

09:31.214 --> 09:33.048
From the good old days, right?

09:33.083 --> 09:34.283
Right.

09:34.317 --> 09:36.285
75 under the table, right?

09:36.319 --> 09:38.020
Yeah, that's the deal.

09:41.358 --> 09:43.959
Nice to see you again.

09:49.032 --> 09:52.034
John: Let's see if we can
find those camping lanterns.

09:52.068 --> 09:55.237
Let's hope they work.

09:55.271 --> 09:57.239
Hey, dad?

09:57.273 --> 09:59.008
Can I ask you something?

09:59.042 --> 10:01.243
It's kind of a guy question.

10:01.277 --> 10:04.079
Sure.

10:04.114 --> 10:08.017
So, how is Emmett handling all this?

10:09.419 --> 10:12.421
Um, I'm not sure.

10:12.455 --> 10:17.026
He, uh, sort of concocted

10:17.060 --> 10:19.228
this story in his head

10:19.262 --> 10:22.264
where he makes everything
that happened Tank's fault,

10:22.298 --> 10:25.167
which is not entirely wrong,

10:25.201 --> 10:27.136
but it's also not, uh...

10:27.170 --> 10:28.404
Entirely the truth.

10:28.438 --> 10:30.973
Exactly.

10:33.343 --> 10:36.278
I'm thinking maybe I should just let it go.

10:38.415 --> 10:41.383
I mean, he doesn't need to
know every single detail.

10:41.418 --> 10:44.453
Should I just let Tank be the bad guy?

10:44.487 --> 10:47.022
For Emmett's sake?

10:47.057 --> 10:49.324
Right.

10:49.359 --> 10:52.327
Honey, I know you've been through a lot...

10:55.098 --> 10:57.466
and I can imagine that
telling your boyfriend

10:57.500 --> 11:00.135
and going through this
all again can't be easy.

11:00.170 --> 11:03.038
I just don't know what the point is.

11:03.073 --> 11:05.407
(Shakily) I'm dealing with it. I'm okay.

11:07.444 --> 11:09.945
But why should I burden him?

11:14.050 --> 11:16.051
Because he loves you.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.193
I don't know that he can handle it.

11:26.629 --> 11:29.064
Don't underestimate him.

11:29.099 --> 11:31.366
Give him a chance.

11:35.004 --> 11:35.971
(Sighs)

11:37.073 --> 11:39.041
I love your chili, mom.

11:39.075 --> 11:43.145
I remember coming home from
college craving bowls of it.

11:43.179 --> 11:45.180
Ah, well, this is... this
is a different recipe.

11:45.215 --> 11:46.415
- It's Lucille's.
- Oh.

11:46.449 --> 11:49.051
I'm from my son, actually.
He's a wonderful cook.

11:49.085 --> 11:52.221
Hey, maybe we'll spend
Thanksgiving together sometime.

11:52.255 --> 11:55.190
Oh, sure. Is there
anything I can do to help?

11:55.225 --> 11:57.092
Oh, just watch and be amazed.

11:57.127 --> 12:00.062
Well, just got off the phone with Regina.

12:00.096 --> 12:02.131
Apparently the whole city's flooded.

12:02.165 --> 12:04.233
She's stuck at the
coffee house with Daphne.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.001
Surprise, surprise.

12:06.035 --> 12:07.169
Toby's fine too, but

12:07.203 --> 12:09.037
no one's going to make it home for dinner.

12:09.072 --> 12:10.205
- Oh no.
- Aww.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.075
That's a shame. I really
wanted to meet them.

12:13.109 --> 12:15.944
Too bad for them, 'cause you
know what? That smells amazing.

12:15.979 --> 12:19.114
John? Lucille is a big baseball fan,

12:19.149 --> 12:21.316
and she has season tickets
to the Diamondbacks.

12:21.351 --> 12:24.052
- Ah.
- Come on!

12:24.087 --> 12:25.420
He doesn't need the houseguest he just met

12:25.455 --> 12:28.056
to be fan-clubbing about baseball.

12:28.091 --> 12:29.958
And she's pulled me into it, too.

12:29.993 --> 12:32.261
Really? You know, when I was playing,

12:32.295 --> 12:34.396
I couldn't get her to
a game to save my life.

12:34.430 --> 12:38.167
Well, you know, if you guys had won the
pennant like the Royals did last year,

12:38.201 --> 12:39.368
I might have come.

12:39.402 --> 12:42.004
- That's nice.
- Enough about baseball.

12:42.038 --> 12:44.072
Are you sure there isn't
anything I can do to help?

12:44.107 --> 12:46.241
Yeah, you can open up that
bottle of Pinot we brought.

12:46.276 --> 12:47.976
Okay? Let's get this party started.

12:48.011 --> 12:49.311
Lucille: Yeah, come on.

12:49.345 --> 12:53.215
Lucille introduced me to that when
we were in... Napa last summer.

12:53.249 --> 12:54.983
You went to Napa?

12:55.018 --> 12:57.386
Yeah. I think I told you, didn't I?

12:57.420 --> 12:58.987
I'm not sure.

12:59.022 --> 13:01.256
Um, I'm going to go find a corkscrew.

13:03.326 --> 13:07.262
You know, I hit pretty well against
Randy Johnson back in the day.

13:07.297 --> 13:09.131
Yeah, I know.

13:09.165 --> 13:11.166
- I remember.
- You were there?

13:11.201 --> 13:13.035
- Yeah.
- Oh no!

13:13.069 --> 13:15.337
- Damn, damn.
- Excuse me a minute.

13:15.371 --> 13:17.272
What is it?

13:17.307 --> 13:21.009
- I think I forgot my blood-pressure medicine.
- No, you didn't.

13:21.044 --> 13:24.313
I packed them in my bag. Don't
worry, I'll go get them for you, okay?

13:24.347 --> 13:27.015
You are so good at this stuff.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.350
I know. (Laughs)

13:28.384 --> 13:30.352
Uh, I'm gonna go check
on Kathryn and the wine,

13:30.386 --> 13:32.154
see what's taking so long.

13:32.188 --> 13:34.189
Hi.

13:34.224 --> 13:36.225
(Whispers) What do you think of her?

13:36.259 --> 13:38.060
What, Lucille?

13:38.094 --> 13:39.995
I think she's great.

13:40.029 --> 13:42.064
I've been trying to get
my mom to go on trips

13:42.098 --> 13:43.332
and take classes for years.

13:43.366 --> 13:44.433
Mm-hmm.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.301
Well, I wonder how she got through to her.

13:46.336 --> 13:49.071
Uh...

13:50.273 --> 13:51.306
What?

13:51.341 --> 13:54.243
Honey, I think they might be a couple.

13:54.277 --> 13:57.379
(Laughs) Don't be ridiculous.

13:59.115 --> 14:00.949
John, my mom is not gay.

14:00.984 --> 14:02.985
She was married for 42 years,

14:03.019 --> 14:05.320
and besides, she's my mom.

14:05.355 --> 14:07.389
(Whispered conversation)

14:14.430 --> 14:16.164
Mm-hmm.

14:16.199 --> 14:18.000
(Both laughing)

14:18.034 --> 14:20.402
<i>Reporter: An important update
for Kansas City, Missouri:</i>

14:20.436 --> 14:23.205
<i>A significant weather
advisory is now in effect.</i>

14:23.339 --> 14:25.974
I could kill that kid.

14:26.009 --> 14:27.976
I could really kill him.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

14:28.011 --> 14:29.177
Mom, don't!

14:29.212 --> 14:32.147
What if he tells Eric about you and Bay?

14:32.181 --> 14:35.017
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a loose canon.

14:35.051 --> 14:38.287
I don't even know if he
knows what Bay did for me.

14:38.321 --> 14:41.189
That kid could get you and
Bay into a lot of trouble,

14:41.224 --> 14:43.091
and he just shows up here?

14:43.126 --> 14:45.394
- To install wi-fi.
- How do we know that?

14:48.031 --> 14:49.164
I don't know.

14:51.134 --> 14:53.435
Once he is done, we send him away.

14:53.469 --> 14:56.271
(Thunder rumbles)

14:56.306 --> 14:57.339
(Both scream)

14:59.208 --> 15:00.942
- You okay?
- Everyone okay?

15:00.977 --> 15:02.210
We're okay.

15:04.380 --> 15:07.015
Power's out in the whole building.

15:07.050 --> 15:11.053
Well, looks like we're
all here for a while.

15:16.710 --> 15:21.114
So you think my mother just
turned gay out of the blue?

15:21.148 --> 15:22.382
Maybe it isn't out of the blue.

15:22.466 --> 15:25.401
(Laughs) Excuse me. What does that mean?

15:25.436 --> 15:28.104
And if she is gay, why
didn't she come out to me?

15:28.138 --> 15:31.174
Well, maybe that's what this
whole trip is about, sweetie.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.276
Maybe that's why she brought
Lucille in the first place.

15:33.310 --> 15:35.378
I think you're letting your
imagination run away with you.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.513
Okay, they're traveling together.

15:37.548 --> 15:41.117
I offered them separate bedrooms
and they wanted to stay together.

15:41.151 --> 15:42.452
So?

15:42.486 --> 15:46.122
Plus Lucille packed some of
Bonnie's things for the trip.

15:46.156 --> 15:48.458
Maybe you should talk to her.

15:48.492 --> 15:51.427
Are you kidding me? We never
talk about things like that, ever.

15:51.462 --> 15:54.430
What if she is struggling
for a way to talk to you?

15:54.465 --> 15:57.099
Okay? And you do nothing?

15:57.134 --> 15:58.468
What then?

16:04.475 --> 16:07.076
We should move the furniture
before it gets ruined.

16:07.110 --> 16:09.145
(Thunder rumbles)

16:29.500 --> 16:32.502
You're the last person
I expected to see here.

16:32.536 --> 16:35.304
I could say the same
about you. I live here.

16:41.378 --> 16:43.513
I heard you left town.

16:43.547 --> 16:46.382
Once they put a warrant out for my arrest,

16:46.416 --> 16:48.217
I had no choice.

16:48.252 --> 16:51.153
It sucks too because my
daughter is still out here,

16:51.188 --> 16:54.123
so I have to sneak back to see her.

16:55.459 --> 16:58.427
How did you get off? You
told me you were on probation.

16:58.462 --> 17:00.296
You should be in big trouble, girl.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.099
Um...

17:03.133 --> 17:04.333
Come on.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.269
We were in it together.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.441
Because I was on probation,

17:12.476 --> 17:15.044
my sister told the cops that she did it.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.146
She didn't have a record,

17:18.181 --> 17:22.151
so she got community
service and house arrest.

17:22.185 --> 17:25.121
We had to pay a bunch of restitution, too.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.488
That tractor was expensive.

17:27.521 --> 17:29.256
Damn.

17:29.291 --> 17:31.325
It's good to be a rich white girl.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.394
I can't even apply for a real job,

17:33.428 --> 17:35.463
because I got this warrant,

17:35.497 --> 17:38.299
so I gotta do this kind of work.

17:46.408 --> 17:48.509
There's not a warrant anymore.

17:48.543 --> 17:50.211
What?

17:50.315 --> 17:51.582
My sister told the cops

17:51.616 --> 17:54.318
that she wrecked that
construction site alone.

17:54.352 --> 17:58.255
She said that you and I
were there to stop her.

17:58.290 --> 17:59.423
The case was closed.

18:02.494 --> 18:04.562
Nobody's looking for you, I swear.

18:06.231 --> 18:09.567
You could come back, maybe get a real job.

18:09.601 --> 18:11.235
Are you sure about this?

18:11.269 --> 18:14.438
Her probation officer told her.

18:14.473 --> 18:15.539
I'm positive.

18:15.574 --> 18:19.376
Looks like your sister did us both a solid.

18:19.411 --> 18:21.212
Say hey for me.

18:26.485 --> 18:30.588
You want to do her a solid back?

18:30.622 --> 18:33.357
Keep this to yourself, okay?

18:33.391 --> 18:35.426
Oh, sure.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.528
I'm glad it all worked out.

18:39.197 --> 18:42.199
Well, I better get back to work.

18:42.234 --> 18:43.601
See you in there.

19:01.002 --> 19:04.160
_

19:07.459 --> 19:09.527
Nice Photoshop.

19:11.928 --> 19:15.770
_

19:15.784 --> 19:17.601
Well, don't post that anywhere.

19:17.636 --> 19:22.373
With my luck, I'll probably
get a probation violation.

19:26.344 --> 19:28.579
Thank you for visiting Bay.

19:28.613 --> 19:30.581
It's great to have you home.

19:30.615 --> 19:33.184
She really missed you.

19:49.634 --> 19:52.236
You done?

19:52.270 --> 19:55.339
So what did we say? $75?
Let me get my checkbook.

19:55.373 --> 19:58.442
Cash only. And 75 isn't going to do it.

20:00.478 --> 20:01.545
Excuse me?

20:01.580 --> 20:04.181
Your daughter told me how
she stayed out of jail.

20:04.216 --> 20:07.551
How do you think the cops would feel
if they found out they got lied to?

20:07.586 --> 20:09.220
You said that we were fine.

20:09.254 --> 20:12.223
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.226
Regina: Nobody would believe you,

20:15.260 --> 20:17.394
plus you'd be incriminating yourself.

20:17.429 --> 20:21.498
Maybe. Or maybe the cops
get an anonymous phone call.

20:21.533 --> 20:23.667
She's a convicted felon.

20:23.702 --> 20:26.570
You want to risk it? I don't think so.

20:30.408 --> 20:32.610
What do you want?

20:32.644 --> 20:33.677
$10,000.

20:33.712 --> 20:36.213
Are you crazy?

20:36.248 --> 20:37.414
This is for my daughter,

20:37.449 --> 20:40.384
and me and my baby girl need to get paid.

20:40.418 --> 20:43.220
I told you, my sister took
the hit for both of us.

20:43.255 --> 20:44.688
We're even. Walk away.

20:44.723 --> 20:47.358
I'm either leaving here with my money

20:47.392 --> 20:51.228
or I'm leaving here to
turn you and your sister in.

20:51.263 --> 20:53.597
It's your call.

21:03.853 --> 21:05.487
Mom?

21:05.521 --> 21:07.489
Can I talk to you?

21:07.523 --> 21:08.723
Sure.

21:12.828 --> 21:16.798
Look, um, I should have
called and let you know

21:16.832 --> 21:19.501
I was bringing a friend. I'm sorry.

21:19.535 --> 21:22.737
Oh, no, it's fine. I'm happy to meet people

21:22.772 --> 21:25.640
that you... that you care about.

21:25.674 --> 21:28.743
- Do you like her?
- I do. I really do.

21:28.778 --> 21:32.714
The family meeting Lucille was
one of the reasons that we're here.

21:32.748 --> 21:34.382
Really?

21:34.417 --> 21:36.718
Really?

21:36.752 --> 21:40.488
Uh... actually, I've been meaning

21:40.523 --> 21:41.689
to talk to you about something.

21:41.724 --> 21:45.794
Um, this is the real
reason I made the trip.

21:45.828 --> 21:48.396
And I'm glad you did.

21:48.431 --> 21:50.565
And I want you to know

21:50.599 --> 21:52.467
that no matter what it is,

21:52.501 --> 21:55.403
I am... I'm supportive.

22:00.823 --> 22:03.591
Um...

22:03.626 --> 22:06.628
I've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

22:09.899 --> 22:12.600
What?

22:12.635 --> 22:14.903
I have dementia.

22:14.937 --> 22:18.873
Early stages, but I've got dementia.

22:18.908 --> 22:20.909
No, you don't.

22:20.943 --> 22:23.645
You're sharp as a tack. You
just learned sign language

22:23.679 --> 22:26.681
and you remember recipes from decades ago.

22:26.715 --> 22:29.884
It... you know, sometimes I just...

22:29.919 --> 22:32.620
I can't remember a word
as simple as "fork,"

22:32.655 --> 22:36.524
and I'm forgetting how to do
things I have done all my life.

22:36.559 --> 22:38.726
I forget things, too.

22:38.761 --> 22:41.563
You've been fine since you've been here.

22:41.597 --> 22:42.897
It doesn't happen every day.

22:42.932 --> 22:44.899
It comes, goes.

22:44.934 --> 22:48.570
I've had blood tests
and neurological tests,

22:48.604 --> 22:52.874
and they pretty much
ruled out everything else.

22:56.512 --> 22:57.645
No.

22:58.647 --> 23:00.782
It's a mistake.

23:02.885 --> 23:04.452
(Sighs)

23:04.486 --> 23:06.821
Honey...

23:06.855 --> 23:08.823
(Crying) No.

23:08.857 --> 23:10.692
No.

23:15.531 --> 23:16.898
(Mutters) Yes, it is.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.579
It's just the tree.

23:31.614 --> 23:33.481
But we're okay out here.

23:33.515 --> 23:35.450
I'm gonna go upstairs
and check on the roof.

23:35.484 --> 23:36.784
- Okay.
- All right.

23:40.923 --> 23:42.590
What are we gonna do?

23:42.625 --> 23:43.925
Just... just give me a minute.

23:43.959 --> 23:48.563
I can't believe we're being sucked
into this mess all over again.

23:48.597 --> 23:49.731
It's never gonna end.

23:49.765 --> 23:52.767
Yes, it is, and it ends now.

23:52.801 --> 23:54.702
I'm gonna pay this guy off.

23:54.737 --> 23:55.803
Are you sure?

23:55.838 --> 23:57.772
Well, what choice do we really have?

23:57.806 --> 24:00.742
If Nacho goes to the cops
and they reopen the case,

24:00.776 --> 24:03.778
you're gonna get kicked out of
school. You might even go to prison.

24:03.812 --> 24:07.415
And Bay will be in big trouble, too.

24:07.449 --> 24:09.751
We're in the middle of
a storm with no power.

24:09.785 --> 24:12.487
How are you going to pay him?

24:21.830 --> 24:25.533
Uh, warning,

24:25.567 --> 24:28.870
if you're posting that
selfie to social media,

24:28.904 --> 24:32.840
retaliation will be swift and brutal.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.066
_

24:39.567 --> 24:41.140
_

24:41.143 --> 24:42.817
What? Why?

24:43.118 --> 24:47.272
_

24:47.389 --> 24:48.823
No, I won't allow it.

24:48.824 --> 24:56.200
_

24:56.201 --> 24:58.566
_

25:00.536 --> 25:01.569
Emmett.

25:01.570 --> 25:05.611
_

25:06.775 --> 25:08.743
Okay, um...

25:13.682 --> 25:16.451
We need to talk about what happened.

25:17.552 --> 25:19.690
_

25:19.698 --> 25:22.824
If you are going to
make a big life decision

25:22.858 --> 25:24.726
based off of what happened to me,

25:24.760 --> 25:26.728
then you have to listen.

25:35.929 --> 25:37.229
_

25:43.746 --> 25:46.848
So I didn't come all this way
just to drop a bomb on you.

25:46.882 --> 25:49.784
I want you to know, I'm not
going to be a burden to anybody.

25:49.818 --> 25:53.521
Bonnie, don't be ridiculous. You
could never be a burden to us.

25:53.555 --> 25:55.523
Well, I appreciate that,

25:55.557 --> 25:59.594
but what I mean is that
my affairs are in order.

25:59.628 --> 26:02.530
The finances, the will... it's all set.

26:02.564 --> 26:05.600
Mom, please just don't
talk like that, please.

26:05.634 --> 26:08.636
It's okay, honey. I've had time to prepare.

26:08.670 --> 26:12.673
Wait, how... how long have you known?

26:12.708 --> 26:17.478
Well, um, I was diagnosed about a year ago.

26:17.513 --> 26:19.680
Why didn't you tell me?

26:19.715 --> 26:22.850
Honey, you... you had so
much going on with the kids,

26:22.885 --> 26:27.422
and then Angelo died,
and I... I needed time.

26:27.456 --> 26:29.657
Mom, I want you to move in here with us.

26:29.691 --> 26:31.759
John: You know what? I
think that's a great idea.

26:31.794 --> 26:34.462
We have access here to the
best doctors in the country.

26:34.496 --> 26:35.630
We can get out ahead of this thing.

26:35.664 --> 26:37.632
Oh, that's really generous,

26:37.666 --> 26:39.867
but I have other plans.

26:41.902 --> 26:43.884
Lucy and I are moving to France.

26:43.889 --> 26:45.956
We're gonna open up a B&B.

26:45.991 --> 26:46.991
(Laughs)

26:47.025 --> 26:49.827
You're joking, right?

26:49.861 --> 26:53.164
No, no, it's something I've
actually always kind of wanted to do.

26:53.198 --> 26:54.832
No, it's not.

26:54.866 --> 26:57.168
Honey. I know this is hard, honey.

26:57.202 --> 26:59.904
And wait, how is that smart?

26:59.938 --> 27:03.641
To live across the world, away from
your doctors? Away from your family?

27:03.675 --> 27:05.976
- Kathryn, we should really talk this through.
- It's a process.

27:06.011 --> 27:09.046
Kathryn, why don't you
hear your mother out?

27:09.081 --> 27:12.683
And who the hell are you, anyway?

27:12.718 --> 27:13.884
We're going to fly to Scottsdale.

27:13.919 --> 27:15.853
We're going to pack up your things.

27:15.887 --> 27:18.756
We're going to get you settled right
here where I can take care of you!

27:18.790 --> 27:19.957
That's what's going to happen.

27:31.686 --> 27:33.687
- No cell service?
- No.

27:33.722 --> 27:35.089
I'm just worried about Will.

27:35.123 --> 27:39.059
He's at a big mall. He's safe.

27:42.898 --> 27:45.699
Can I ask you a favor?

27:45.734 --> 27:46.767
Sure.

27:46.802 --> 27:49.136
I just...

27:49.171 --> 27:51.672
I screwed up. Daphne just reminded me

27:51.706 --> 27:53.774
that I forgot to pay her
second-semester tuition

27:53.809 --> 27:55.876
and it's way past due.

27:55.911 --> 27:57.812
If I don't pay tomorrow,
she's not going to be able

27:57.846 --> 27:59.079
to register for her new classes.

27:59.114 --> 28:01.816
Okay. Well, I think
we've got about 12 grand.

28:01.850 --> 28:03.751
How much do you need?

28:03.785 --> 28:05.085
Pretty much all of it.

28:07.756 --> 28:10.724
What's going on?

28:10.759 --> 28:12.760
I... I know it's a lot of money,

28:12.794 --> 28:14.795
but the university is so uptight about...

28:14.830 --> 28:16.897
Regina, don't lie to me.

28:19.835 --> 28:21.769
(Sighs)

28:21.803 --> 28:25.840
It's a long story. And for a
lot of reasons, I can't tell you.

28:25.874 --> 28:29.076
Here's how this works:

28:29.110 --> 28:32.112
I don't need to know how
you got into this mess.

28:32.147 --> 28:35.883
I just need to know what's
going on now, so I can help you.

28:35.917 --> 28:38.018
Look, if our partnership
means anything to you,

28:38.053 --> 28:40.754
you're just going to
have to trust me on this.

28:46.161 --> 28:47.995
It's that kid, isn't it?

28:52.801 --> 28:54.835
Now you've got to trust me.

28:54.870 --> 28:56.670
What's he up to?

28:58.673 --> 29:01.709
He's blackmailing me, but I
don't want you to get involved.

29:01.743 --> 29:05.012
Oh, I'm getting involved.

29:08.817 --> 29:11.085
We need to talk, yo.

29:11.119 --> 29:14.855
Uh, I told Regina your
Internet is all good,

29:14.890 --> 29:17.024
but ain't nothing I can do
about the power. That's citywide.

29:17.058 --> 29:18.659
That's not what I'm talking about.

29:18.693 --> 29:19.894
You asked for money from my partner?

29:24.132 --> 29:26.967
Man, this ain't got nothing
to do with you, a'ight?

29:27.002 --> 29:29.637
Eric, it's okay, really. He's right.

29:29.671 --> 29:31.639
This is between him and me.

29:31.673 --> 29:32.907
No, it's not.

29:32.941 --> 29:35.009
You see, if you ask my partner for money,

29:35.043 --> 29:37.978
it's the same thing as asking me for money,

29:38.013 --> 29:40.114
and nobody shakes me down.

29:40.148 --> 29:42.650
I got no beef with you, all right?

29:42.684 --> 29:43.918
It was her dumb-ass daughter that got us

29:43.952 --> 29:46.787
- into all this trouble to begin with.
- That is a lie.

29:46.821 --> 29:48.923
And then the sister from
Mission Hills bails her out,

29:48.957 --> 29:51.926
leaving me to spend the rest
of my days hiding from the cops?

29:51.960 --> 29:54.662
Money is the least they can do.

29:54.696 --> 29:56.797
Me and my daughter got what's coming to us.

29:56.831 --> 29:58.666
Yo, sit down.

29:59.801 --> 30:01.902
I know you may look around here

30:01.937 --> 30:04.805
and think you see a bunch
of nice wealthy people

30:04.839 --> 30:06.140
that you can roll,

30:06.174 --> 30:08.142
but I'm here to tell you
that you're wrong about that.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.148
Yeah.

30:14.182 --> 30:15.883
That's right.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.919
Now you know what I'm talking about.

30:24.826 --> 30:26.827
It's cool.

30:26.861 --> 30:28.729
Really, man, it's cool.

30:28.763 --> 30:31.165
Listen up, these are my people.

30:31.199 --> 30:34.868
You do anything to mess with them,

30:34.903 --> 30:37.871
and there'll never be a place
safe enough for you to hide.

30:39.107 --> 30:40.808
You feel me?

30:40.842 --> 30:42.710
I've got you.

30:42.744 --> 30:43.877
Good.

30:50.118 --> 30:52.119
That's for the wi-fi.

30:56.124 --> 30:57.758
That's for your kid.

30:59.761 --> 31:00.961
I'm a dad, too.

31:08.169 --> 31:10.871
Now beat it.

31:23.752 --> 31:24.985
(Door bells jingle)

31:40.248 --> 31:43.050
Don't ask me to be sorry.

31:44.886 --> 31:47.121
You have to hear what I have to say,

31:47.155 --> 31:49.823
and if you still feel the same afterwards,

31:49.858 --> 31:52.993
then... fine.

31:59.834 --> 32:02.836
I love you so much for your concern...

32:04.906 --> 32:07.174
But there's nothing we can do about this.

32:07.208 --> 32:09.910
You don't know that.

32:09.944 --> 32:12.146
I do.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.849
I'm taking meds to forestall it,

32:15.884 --> 32:17.151
but there's no cure.

32:18.085 --> 32:20.187
It is what it is.

32:20.221 --> 32:24.758
So you know what it's all about for me now.

32:24.792 --> 32:26.160
Time.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.029
I've been a wife and mother all my life,

32:29.063 --> 32:31.198
and I wouldn't change that for anything,

32:31.232 --> 32:36.036
but I... I never got
to follow my own dreams,

32:36.070 --> 32:39.072
because I was always
putting somebody else first.

32:41.009 --> 32:44.044
And now with...

32:44.078 --> 32:46.113
The time I have left,

32:46.147 --> 32:49.082
I want to change that.

32:49.117 --> 32:51.818
But you can't be on your own, mom.

32:51.853 --> 32:55.956
At least, not for much longer.

32:55.990 --> 32:58.125
I won't be. I have Lucille.

33:00.094 --> 33:03.130
Mom, are you...

33:05.833 --> 33:07.801
She's my friend.

33:07.835 --> 33:10.103
My best friend.

33:10.138 --> 33:11.838
And?

33:13.975 --> 33:16.777
And I love her.

33:25.853 --> 33:28.088
You know, this must all seem so silly,

33:28.122 --> 33:32.025
this running off to
Provence, and maybe it is.

33:32.060 --> 33:36.196
But I... I do not want to grow old

33:36.231 --> 33:40.067
eating mashed potatoes in some
assisted-living facility in Scottsdale.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.969
I want to eat almond croissants,

33:42.003 --> 33:44.071
meet people from all over the world,

33:44.105 --> 33:48.075
and practice my terrible
French with Lucille.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.244
That's what I want.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.080
Okay.

33:54.249 --> 33:57.251
I'll be fine, I promise.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.954
And I'll send postcards.

34:04.859 --> 34:06.994
(Crying)

34:12.900 --> 34:14.868
So, um,

34:14.902 --> 34:17.204
I guess what I'm saying is

34:17.237 --> 34:21.875
both Tank and I made mistakes.

34:21.876 --> 34:26.764
_

34:27.047 --> 34:29.081
Yes, he should have,

34:29.117 --> 34:31.752
but, um...

34:31.786 --> 34:33.186
It's complicated.

34:33.221 --> 34:37.123
And you've been in this situation before.

34:37.158 --> 34:41.828
You've been drunk and
made stupid choices and...

34:44.529 --> 34:48.369
- _
- What?  No, I'm not saying...

34:48.803 --> 34:51.103
Okay, just stop trying to trap me.

34:51.139 --> 34:56.076
I'm saying it's not about making
Tank out to be some monster.

34:56.077 --> 34:58.621
- _
- I'm not.

34:58.622 --> 35:04.440
_

35:04.919 --> 35:06.820
No, that's not true.

35:06.821 --> 35:13.012
_

35:13.227 --> 35:16.096
I told you... I felt sick

35:16.130 --> 35:17.998
and I wanted to lie down.

35:17.999 --> 35:19.200
_

35:19.227 --> 35:20.501
No!

35:20.502 --> 35:23.366
_

35:23.367 --> 35:25.631
_

35:26.007 --> 35:28.909
Was I upset about us? Yes.

35:28.943 --> 35:32.045
I was, and that's probably
why I drank too much,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.881
but I was not trying to get back at you,

35:34.916 --> 35:36.917
and I cannot believe that
you would even ask me that!

35:36.918 --> 35:42.173
_

35:42.174 --> 35:46.742
_

35:46.994 --> 35:49.177
This is not about cheating, so...

35:49.178 --> 35:51.720
_

35:52.867 --> 35:55.035
No, it wasn't a coincidence. Emmett!

35:55.069 --> 35:57.237
- (Door opens)
- (Groans)

35:59.140 --> 36:00.741
Emmett.

36:01.876 --> 36:04.010
Emmett, I'm trying to explain this,

36:04.045 --> 36:07.147
and all you want to do is point fingers.

36:07.181 --> 36:10.751
Either he's the monster or I am,

36:10.785 --> 36:12.886
and why can't it be
somewhere in the middle?

36:12.920 --> 36:16.089
Why can't you get this? I'm
trying to be honest with you.

36:16.104 --> 36:19.706
And it's like you prefer
your version of what happened.

36:19.707 --> 36:21.718
_

36:21.943 --> 36:23.710
And live a lie?

36:25.980 --> 36:28.015
If we're going to get past this,

36:28.049 --> 36:31.818
then I need you to know the
truth and be okay with it.

36:31.819 --> 36:34.125
_

36:35.657 --> 36:38.792
Then I don't know where that leaves us.

36:41.393 --> 36:43.712
_

37:14.547 --> 37:16.782
You're not going to have any
more trouble with that guy.

37:16.816 --> 37:18.417
Trust me.

37:18.451 --> 37:21.787
Okay. Not that I'm ungrateful or anything,

37:21.821 --> 37:23.789
but can you tell me what just happened?

37:26.392 --> 37:29.361
I showed him this.

37:31.497 --> 37:33.799
It's a gang tattoo.

37:33.833 --> 37:36.535
- You're in a gang?
- Used to be...

37:36.569 --> 37:39.471
But Nacho doesn't need to know that.

37:39.505 --> 37:41.640
Like I told you when we first met,

37:41.674 --> 37:44.443
there are parts of my
life that I'm not proud of.

37:44.477 --> 37:46.612
But this...

37:46.646 --> 37:48.380
this is my past.

37:48.414 --> 37:52.517
It's no secret. It's just not
a part of who I am anymore.

37:55.488 --> 37:59.491
I guess everyone has
secrets they're not proud of.

37:59.525 --> 38:01.560
Now you know ours.

38:03.463 --> 38:04.696
Thank you.

38:06.633 --> 38:09.334
<i>Reporter: The flash-flood
watch advisory has been lifted</i>

38:09.369 --> 38:11.436
<i>for Jackson, Clay, and
Cass counties in Missouri,</i>

38:11.471 --> 38:13.739
<i>as well as Wyandotte County in Kansas.</i>

38:19.479 --> 38:22.381
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:23.583 --> 38:25.350
Could I come in?

38:25.385 --> 38:26.551
Yeah.

38:26.586 --> 38:30.389
Look, I'm really sorry that
I lost my temper earlier.

38:30.423 --> 38:33.425
You have every right to think I'm a bitch

38:33.459 --> 38:34.793
for snapping at you like that.

38:34.827 --> 38:38.530
Honey, I understand. She's your mother.

38:38.564 --> 38:42.567
Thank you for being her friend...

38:43.870 --> 38:48.440
Or whatever you are.

38:54.614 --> 38:56.581
Companion.

38:59.652 --> 39:02.321
- Hey, dad.
- Oh!

39:02.355 --> 39:03.689
I was so worried about you!

39:03.723 --> 39:05.457
We just climbed over the tree.

39:05.491 --> 39:06.758
Is that right?

39:06.793 --> 39:10.395
I know it's hard for you
to see me with someone else.

39:12.565 --> 39:14.566
(Emotionally) I want to be okay with it.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.635
I really do.

39:18.571 --> 39:22.674
You know my heart will
always be with Angelo,

39:22.709 --> 39:26.511
but I don't want to
grieve him my entire life.

39:26.546 --> 39:29.548
No, I don't want that, either.

39:35.655 --> 39:37.422
(Sighs)

39:37.457 --> 39:40.425
Thank you so much for getting
him here. Drive safely, okay?

39:40.460 --> 39:41.593
Yeah, thank you, Eric. Bye, Will.

39:41.627 --> 39:43.462
Bye, thanks.

39:43.496 --> 39:45.497
So?

39:45.531 --> 39:47.766
What do you think of the place?

39:47.800 --> 39:51.436
Oh, I'm sorry. Mom, it's fantastic.

39:51.471 --> 39:53.372
Thanks.

39:53.406 --> 39:54.539
Oh, and the lights went out in the mall.

39:54.574 --> 39:56.475
We couldn't go to the movies.

39:56.509 --> 39:58.777
- And that was fun?
- Yeah,

39:58.811 --> 40:01.680
'cause the guy at Ben & Jerry's
gave us a billion free samples.

40:01.714 --> 40:04.683
- Said it was all going to melt anyway.
- (Laughs)

40:04.717 --> 40:06.752
I guess I will see you tomorrow, partner.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.621
Don't be a stranger.

40:09.655 --> 40:10.756
I won't.

40:15.628 --> 40:17.396
Come on.

40:21.601 --> 40:23.502
(Door bells jangle)

40:23.536 --> 40:24.870
You like her, don't you, dad?

40:24.904 --> 40:27.406
Yeah, I do.

40:29.609 --> 40:33.445
I like it here, and I don't
want to leave this time.

40:33.479 --> 40:34.846
(Sighs)

40:34.881 --> 40:37.649
Neither do I, buddy.

41:01.841 --> 41:03.842
Are you okay?

41:08.843 --> 41:10.043
I told him.

41:11.144 --> 41:12.504
I told him him everything.

41:18.205 --> 41:20.530
And now I think I lost him.

41:24.831 --> 41:25.734
Come here.
