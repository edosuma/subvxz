the kind of care you need.

Check the front.
Tell security.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.147
- Did you snow him
to force him into surgery?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.322
- Why would I do that?

00:18.366 --> 00:20.237
- I think you're suffering
from PTSD.

That's why I keep pushing you
to talk to Dr. Charles.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.329

Something's off.

any idea how it might affect
a patient with an LVAD?

suffering any adverse reaction,

is from the trial meds?

Oh.

I think you're right.

How's her
cardiac function been?

- On just the standard meds?

- Why?
Shouldn't it be?

been responding before,

03:10.886 --> 03:13.889
but it looks like
they're working well.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.457

a full workup.

- Okay, I'll get a liver panel,
CBC, CMP, and coags.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.984
- Thanks.
- And we'll need a list

03:22.027 --> 03:24.943
of her medications as well.
- Okay.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.249
- Okay.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.772
- This could be
a drug interaction.

We have to rule everything out.
- Yeah, you're right.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.602
But this doesn't look surgical.
I'll take it from here.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.562
It could be an obstruction,
gallstones.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.868
I better stay on
just to be safe.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.261

- Yeah?

03:40.394 --> 03:41.917
everything you're doing
to help,

03:41.960 --> 03:44.528
and I promise as soon
as this becomes surgical,

03:44.572 --> 03:46.313
I will call you, okay?

03:51.535 --> 03:52.754
- Whatever you want.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.538
I'll see you, Carol.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.454
Bye.

- Morning, Sharon.

- How's it going?
- Okay.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.565

04:21.609 --> 04:23.480
She said tomorrow's
Vanessa's last day here.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.960
I didn't handle things right.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.441
- Well, it's not
an easy situation.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.444
- I know, but I'm thinking

04:30.487 --> 04:32.402
maybe if I told her
the truth...

04:32.446 --> 04:35.231
I just don't like leaving
things the way that they are

04:35.275 --> 04:36.798
with the two of us at odds.

04:36.841 --> 04:39.366
- I don't know, Maggie.
Once you take that step...

04:39.409 --> 04:40.932
- I know.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.248
- Morning, Dean.
- Hey.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.078
- So, uh,

04:56.121 --> 04:57.775
I have to ask,

04:57.819 --> 04:59.124
have you sat down
with Dr. Charles yet?

04:59.168 --> 05:01.039
- Mmm.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.912
Actually, he referred me
to a veterans' therapy group.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.217
I went last night.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.307
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.484
It was something, man.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.224
The stories you hear,

05:12.268 --> 05:15.924
the things people
have been through is a--

05:15.967 --> 05:18.274
There's a deep well
of pain out there, man.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.972
- I can imagine.
I bet you had some stories too.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.931
- Ah, well,
nothing worth saying

05:22.974 --> 05:24.933
compared to what
I heard last night.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
And I wanna thank you

05:26.326 --> 05:28.328
for, uh, leaning on me.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.981
Last night was inspiring.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.418
- I'm sorry.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.071
Am I interrupting?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.159
- No, ma'am.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.248
- We have an 18-year-old

05:36.292 --> 05:37.946
in Treatment 6.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.382
And a few weeks ago,

05:39.426 --> 05:43.081
she was diagnosed with
a cranial hemangioblastoma.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.344
- At 18?
That's tough.

05:44.387 --> 05:47.434
- Yeah.
Do you two mind taking a look?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.523
- Of course.
- Thank you.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.441
- Mindy, is this the first time
you've passed out

05:54.484 --> 05:55.877
since your diagnosis?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.139
- I just got dizzy
for a second.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.446
It's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.186
- When they diagnosed her
last month,

06:01.230 --> 06:04.146
they said the tumor was small.
Does this mean it's growing?

06:04.189 --> 06:05.452
- Well, possibly.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.410
Or it could mean
there's a bleed.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.543
Either would be a reason to
recommend surgery to remove it.

06:09.586 --> 06:10.892
- I'm not doing that.

06:10.935 --> 06:11.980
- But sweetie,
if it's getting worse--

06:12.023 --> 06:12.981
- No!

06:13.024 --> 06:14.852
No one's digging
through my brain.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.376
- She's spent the last month
glued to her computer

06:16.419 --> 06:18.465
reading horror stories
about brain surgery.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.249
- They're not just stories,
Dad.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.946
People come out changed.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.385
They stutter, or have seizures,
they forget everybody's names.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.084
I play the piano.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.434
What if I can't
do that anymore?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.044
Uh-uh, no way.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.959
- Okay,
before we go any further,

06:35.003 --> 06:37.353
why don't we get a CT
to see what we're dealing with?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.051
Then we can talk again
and come up with a plan.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.272
- Yeah.
- Uh, we'll be right back.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.404
- Excuse us.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.498
- Her oncologist
wanted to remove the tumor

06:51.541 --> 06:52.934
back when
she was first diagnosed.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.197
- But you can see,
there's no talking to her.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.025
Is there any way that...

06:57.068 --> 06:59.288
- Can we make her do it?

06:59.331 --> 07:02.073
- Uh, I'm sorry, but no.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.292
She's 18 years old.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.033
She has a right
to make her own decisions.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.600
- But she's still a kid.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.211
She doesn't understand
the consequences.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.040
We're at our wit's end.
We don't know what else to do.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.911
- Look, I see how distressing
this is,

07:13.955 --> 07:16.087
and understandably so,

07:16.131 --> 07:18.220
but there is one thing,
as parents, you can do.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.265
- [cries]
Tell us.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.442
- You can apply for temporary
power of attorney.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.009
This will give you the ability
to make medical decisions

07:25.053 --> 07:27.534
should she become unconscious.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.927
- You can do it
with her consent,

07:29.971 --> 07:33.104
but using it to get a procedure
she doesn't want

07:33.148 --> 07:35.542
would be still be circumventing
your daughter's stated wishes.

07:35.585 --> 07:39.067
- With the goal
of saving her life.

07:39.110 --> 07:42.070
- Okay, can we discuss it?
- Of course.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.159
In the meantime,
I'll order a CT.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.171
- [sighs]

07:56.214 --> 07:58.303
Mom's going up
for her echo now.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.088
Are those her labs?

08:00.131 --> 08:01.219
- Yeah.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.483
It is acute liver failure.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.093
- Oh, God.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.095
- And look at this.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.446
- Hepatitis C?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.188
- She must've been carrying it
a long time asymptomatically,

08:13.231 --> 08:15.538
which means something happened

08:15.582 --> 08:17.018
to push her over the edge.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.194
- Do you think
it's a drug interaction?

08:19.237 --> 08:21.544
- I'm not sure
what else it could be.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.112
- Well, we have to take her
off the trial medication.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.461
- That's our only choice.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.419
- Oh, God.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.595
- I know.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.466
I'll put her back
on her old cardiac meds

08:30.510 --> 08:32.468
until we can get her
liver failure under control.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.210
- And then what?
- I'll find something.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.474
- Thanks.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.693
- Yeah.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.478
- I found her
sitting on a bench.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.132
She said that
she wanted to talk to you.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.613
- Wow.
Thanks, Mags.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.005
- Yeah.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.314
- Hi, Dr. Charles.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.663
- Ramona, how you doing?

08:53.707 --> 08:55.230
- Good.
Very good.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.493
- You know,
you gave me a real scare

08:57.537 --> 08:59.582
running out of here
like you did last time.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.324
I'm glad to see you're okay.
- I'm sorry.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.456
There's no reason
for you to worry.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.285
- So, um, what's going on?
What can I do for you?

09:07.329 --> 09:10.158
- Actually I just wanted you
to know that I'm fine.

09:10.201 --> 09:13.596
- Oh, you know, that's great.
And you know what?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.511
I really appreciate
you letting me know, I do.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.819
- Yeah, I just got a new
apartment, and I'm working.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.211
I mean, I'm just temping now,

09:20.255 --> 09:22.126
but I think
they'll keep me on full time.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.173
- Wow, things are, uh,
really looking up.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.478
- They are.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.524
So I thought if you had
a little free time,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.266
maybe we could
get a cup of coffee?

09:31.309 --> 09:34.356
- You know what, I'm in
the middle of my workday.

09:34.399 --> 09:37.359
But I really would like to hear
about what's going on with you.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.840
So, um, so what do you say,
I don't know,

09:39.883 --> 09:41.711
let's make an appointment,
you know, meet in my office

09:41.755 --> 09:43.408
and have a proper chat?

09:44.496 --> 09:46.629
- I just thought
we could hang out.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
- Probably better
that we make an appointment.

09:48.326 --> 09:51.634
I tell you what.
Call me anytime, okay?

09:51.678 --> 09:52.766
I mean it.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.245
If you don't get me,
leave a message.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.638
I'll call you right back, okay?

09:55.682 --> 09:57.379
- Okay.
- Great.

Really good to see you, Ramona.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.432

10:07.476 --> 10:11.088
- 26-year-old male
in respiratory distress,

10:11.132 --> 10:13.700
status-post double lung
transplant eight days ago.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.789
- James.
- You know him?

10:15.832 --> 10:17.486
- Yeah, I was his surgeon.
Hillary, hey.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.618
What happened?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.141
- He started having
trouble breathing

10:20.184 --> 10:21.577
the day after we got home.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.232
His pulmonologist said
to continue taking his meds,

10:24.275 --> 10:27.583
but he just kept getting worse
until today he got a fever.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.454
- Yeah, okay.
All right.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.892
James, we're gonna take
good care of you, bud, okay?

10:31.935 --> 10:35.243
On my count.
One, two, three.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.419
There we go.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.900
James, on a scale of one to
ten, how hard is it to breathe?

10:39.943 --> 10:43.425
- Eight.
Maybe a nine.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.340
- O2 stats 85 on 12 liters,

10:45.383 --> 10:47.559
and he's tachycardic at 106.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.909
- Deep breaths for me, James.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.215
- [labored breaths]

10:51.259 --> 10:53.827
- Yeah, major consolidation
in both the lungs.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.829
Let's order cultures, lytes,
CBC with diff,

10:55.872 --> 10:58.919

up for a chest CT, stat.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.617
- Got it.
- Let me see your hands, bud.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.488
- Is he rejecting the lungs?

11:03.532 --> 11:05.621
- No, he's immunosuppressed,
so he shouldn't be,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.710
but he definitely got
a bilateral pneumonia.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.407
The question is why.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.148
James, I want to get you

11:11.192 --> 11:12.454
on a BIPAP machine

11:13.803 --> 11:15.892
Okay, you hang in there
for me, okay?

I'll check back soon,
all right?

a single case of liver failure

11:44.965 --> 11:46.749
in the entire trial.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.751

a contra-indication,

11:48.795 --> 11:51.928
then Kender needs to know.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.235

Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

I stole the pills.

I can come up with

12:38.366 --> 12:40.150
for getting a pneumonia

the options are not good.

to search
for a new pair of lungs,

it's worth retesting him.

you were right.

out of the game lately.

how awful that must've been

17:07.809 --> 17:10.029

But it's all in the past now.

to talk about this.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.353
we use some different

are sticklers on it,

a long QT interval?

- Exactly, but there's
an upside to that.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.681

for biventricular pacing.

Nothing to do with the liver.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.821
- It's a major procedure,
and she's extremely sick.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.605
- Yeah, if we don't
try something,

18:48.649 --> 18:51.521
she could go into a dangerous
arrhythmia at any moment.

18:51.565 --> 18:52.827
- But it's not a cure.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.524
I mean, she still needs
a heart transplant.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.352

best shot at keeping her alive

have Mindy make this decision.

You know we screen
all Hep-positive patients out.

23:51.647 --> 23:52.909
- Right.

Though, if we

23:55.129 --> 23:56.957
knew there was
a definite contraindication

- I suppose.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.530

24:12.538 --> 24:14.931

slip through protocols?

- No, it's not that
she slipped through,

24:18.021 --> 24:19.849
it's that she's not
part of the trial.

Will, this is a massive

24:34.995 --> 24:36.866
is that a very sick woman--
- Dr. Halstead,

24:36.910 --> 24:39.478

And you betray me like this.
