00:01.580 --> 00:02.991
SO, WHAT'D YOU DO
IN PRISON?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.241
PREACH: READ BOOKS.
TROJAN WAR WAS COOL.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.580
THEY BUILD
A WOODEN HORSE

00:06.590 --> 00:07.739
SO THEY CAN TAKE THEM
DOWN FROM THE INSIDE.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.240
SOUNDS LIKE
THEY WERE SMART.

00:09.250 --> 00:10.547
THEY WEREN'T AS SMART AS
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.166
YOU HAVE A BIG,
EMPTY HOUSE

00:12.170 --> 00:13.331
JUST SITTING HERE.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.637
HIS DAD
KICKED HIM OUT.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.347
HE'S LIVING
IN HIS CAR.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.545
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE GUEST BEDROOM 1IS.

00:17.550 --> 00:18.631
WHO'S THIS?

00:18.640 --> 00:20.096
SPENCER,
THIS IS MICAH.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.807
-HEY.

00:21.810 --> 00:23.596
BILLY: WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON WITH SPENCER TODAY?

00:23.600 --> 00:25.227
HIS DAD'S HERE.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.516
COREY: I WON'T TELL
SPENCER THE TRUTH.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.773
I JUST WANT TO BE
IN HIS LIFE. IT'S TIME.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.441
SON.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.532
YOU DON'T GET
TO CALL ME THAT.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.281
GRACE: SPENCER.
COREY: NO.

00:44.290 --> 00:47.248
IT'S OK.
FAIR ENOUGH.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.161
SPENCER.

00:51.170 --> 00:53.298
MIND IF WE HAVE
A LITTLE TALK?

00:55.630 --> 00:56.961
YOU'VE BEEN
BACK IN L.A.

00:56.970 --> 00:58.381
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT
EASTERN NEVADA,

00:58.390 --> 00:59.846
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO TALK?

00:59.850 --> 01:02.387
10 MINUTES.
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.381
10 MINUTES.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.893
THAT SUPPOSED TO MAKE
UP FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.641
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

01:08.650 --> 01:11.017
HEY, SPENCE, FORGOT
YOUR WALLET, MAN.

01:16.780 --> 01:19.488
COREY.

01:19.490 --> 01:21.572

01:24.580 --> 01:26.036

01:26.040 --> 01:27.917
COREY: SPENCER.
GRACE: LET HIM BE.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.910
BILLY: LOOK, THIS IS
A LOT FOR HIM.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.547
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET
GOING FOR TONIGHT.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.370
COREY: YOU DON'T
GET TO MAKE THAT CALL.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.757
GRACE: YEAH, BUT I DO,

01:36.760 --> 01:38.717
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU BOTH
NEED TO GO.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.937
COOP, VOICE-OVER:
YOU HAD ME SCARED.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.988
SHAWN: AIN'T NOTHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.890
THERE IS A WAY OUT,
EVEN FOR ME,

01:57.900 --> 01:59.026
BUT I OWE YOU, COOP.

01:59.030 --> 02:00.111

OK, NICE AND EASY.

02:26.270 --> 02:27.977
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT
YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

02:32.270 --> 02:33.977
HEY, YOU LOOK GOOD

02:33.980 --> 02:35.812
-COOP,

02:35.820 --> 02:37.390
THERE'S SOMETHING

02:37.400 --> 02:38.890
THE SUN IS

TEAM EFFORT ALL AROUND.

03:19.070 --> 03:21.107

03:28.790 --> 03:31.361
WAIT. HOLD UP.

03:32.870 --> 03:34.167
DILLON:
MOM, SOME PEOPLE

03:34.170 --> 03:35.535
ARE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE

03:35.540 --> 03:37.793
70 BIRTHDAYS
IN THEIR LIFETIME.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.256
YOU GOTTA MAKE
EACH ONE COUNT.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.500
HEY, I GOT YOU,
LITTLE MAN.

03:40.510 --> 03:41.500
YOU GONNA GET

03:41.510 --> 03:42.545

03:42.550 --> 03:43.631
AND WE'RE FITTING

03:43.640 --> 03:45.677
IN WHAT BACKYARD?

03:45.680 --> 03:48.342
GO GET READY.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.970
AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR
ALL OF THIS HOW?

03:54.980 --> 03:56.607
FLIP'S COUSIN GOT
A PARTY STORE.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.476
SAID HE'D
HOOK ME UP.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.617
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM YOUR FATHER?

04:06.620 --> 04:08.486
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

04:08.490 --> 04:12.449
NO. BUT THAT'S
HIS M.O., RIGHT?

04:12.460 --> 04:13.575
JUST DROP OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH

04:13.580 --> 04:15.241
WHENEVER HE WANT TO?

04:15.250 --> 04:16.786
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT
HIS INTENTIONS ARE,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.588
I THINK IT'S BEST THAT
WE DON'T TELL DILLON

04:18.589 --> 04:19.954
THAT COREY
STOPPED BY.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.837
I DON'T WANT HIM
GETTING HIS HOPES UP.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.330
WHAT IF HE COMES
TO THE PARTY?

04:23.340 --> 04:26.332
WELL, IF HE DOES,
WE'LL JUST DEAL WITH IT.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.519
GIRL ON TV: HAPPY MAY?
HAPPY MAY?

04:35.850 --> 04:37.648
HAPPY MAY!

04:40.650 --> 04:42.140
GIRL ON TV: NOW!

04:42.150 --> 04:43.811
BOY ON TV: IT WAS
THE FIRST DAY OF MAY.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.481
IF YOU'RE WONDERING,
"IS THAT DATE

04:45.490 --> 04:48.528
IMPORTANT TO THE STORY?"
WELL, NOT REALLY.

04:48.530 --> 04:51.659
LEILA: CARTOONS AND
CEREAL. HOW CUTE.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.038
IT'S NOT CARTOONS.
IT'S ANIME.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.873
REALLY, ASHER?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.621
MY BAD.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.086
I THOUGHT I LEFT
ENOUGH IN THERE.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.001
FOR WHO?
A CAT?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.080
SINCE WHEN DID YOU
START LIKING

05:03.090 --> 05:04.751
ALMOND MILK, ANYWAY?

05:04.760 --> 05:06.330
SINCE IT WAS
ALL THAT WE HAD.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.923
HEY, WE NEED TO TALK.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.467
THERE'S 4 WORDS A GUY
NEVER LIKES TO HEAR.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.677
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS

05:14.680 --> 05:16.341
AND YOU CAN'T IGNORE

05:16.350 --> 05:18.933
THIS SITUATION WITH YOUR
PARENTS INDEFINITELY.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.477
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, OK?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.027
I HAVE A PLAN.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.481
COOP: YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

05:30.490 --> 05:31.787
THOUGH THE TIMING SUCKS,

05:31.790 --> 05:33.576
I LOVE THAT MS. GRACE
GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.708
MAN, DON'T CALL

05:35.710 --> 05:37.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.281
NAH, BOO GOT
MORE WEIGHT ON IT.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.042
IF YOU DON'T
STOP PLAYING.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.580
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW
HOW YOU GET

05:46.590 --> 05:47.876
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR TIME

05:47.880 --> 05:49.587
PROCESSING
THINGS, BUT

05:49.590 --> 05:50.671
I'M HERE FOR YOU
IF YOU WANT TO

05:50.680 --> 05:52.216
TALK ABOUT
YOUR POP.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.710
AIN'T NOTHING
TO SAY.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.130
AIN'T NO WAY I'll
EVER FORGIVE HIM.

05:59.350 --> 06:00.602
SO, ARE YOU STILL
BRINGING THEM

06:00.610 --> 06:01.725
COOLERS TO
DILLON'S PARTY?

06:01.730 --> 06:03.892
YES, SIR.
TOMORROW AT NOON.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.937
YOU SETTLE
ON A SPOT YET?

06:05.940 --> 06:07.442
ESSENCE SQUARE PARK.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.616
WHY YOU LOOKING

06:12.620 --> 06:15.658
YOU KNOW WHY.
TYRONE?

06:15.660 --> 06:16.866
LOOK, CLEANING UP
THE PARK

06:16.870 --> 06:18.417
AND PUSHING HIS BOYS OUT
IS ONE THING,

06:18.420 --> 06:20.661
BUT THROWING
A LOUD-ASS PARTY,

06:20.670 --> 06:21.785
RIGHT IN HIS FACE?

06:21.790 --> 06:22.916
YOU THINK THAT'S
THE RIGHT MOVE?

06:22.920 --> 06:26.208
COOP, IT'S
A KIDS' PARTY.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.872
SHEET CAKE, FREEZE TAG,
POP GUNS.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.713
TYRONE AIN'T CHECKING
FOR US.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.131
ALL RIGHT.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.897
SPENCER: FLIP. FLIP: WHAT'S
GOOD WITH YOU, LOVED ONE?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.516
SPENCER: GREAT, HOMIE.
FLIP: AH, BOY,

SPENCER: YES, SIR.
FLIP: YOU HAD THEIR DEFENSE

06:48.950 --> 06:50.270

06:50.280 --> 06:51.520
MIGHT WORK ON

06:51.530 --> 06:52.861
OH, IS THAT WHAT
YOU CALL IT? OK.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.190
SO, WHAT'S UP?
I THOUGHT WE WAS

06:54.200 --> 06:55.486
MEETING AT YOUR COUSIN'S
PARTY STORE.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.821
OH, THIS IT.
THINK OF IT AS

06:56.830 --> 06:58.241
AN OUTDOOR SWAP MEET.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.287
ONLY IN CRENSHAW.

07:00.290 --> 07:01.746
YOU KNOW HOW WE DO.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.990
TYRONE: SPENCER JAMES.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.297
DAMN.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.540
SPENCER: WHAT YOU
DOING HERE, MAN?

07:07.550 --> 07:08.915
IT'S A FREE SIDEWALK,
AIN'T IT?

07:08.920 --> 07:10.422
KEEP IT MOVING, TYRONE.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.670
WORD ON THE STREET IS
YOU PLANNING

07:11.680 --> 07:12.465
A PARTY AT THE PARK.

07:12.470 --> 07:13.540
IT'S A PUBLIC PARK.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.506
NAH, I GOT THIS,
SPENCE.

07:14.510 --> 07:15.500
WHAT'S IT MATTER TO YOU?

07:15.510 --> 07:16.671
YOU AIN'T INVITED.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.216
GO HOME, FLIP.
THIS IS ABOUT ME

07:18.220 --> 07:19.551
AND THE LITTLE HOMIE
RIGHT HERE.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.630
FLIP: OH, OK, I GET IT.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.971
SO, YOU STILL SALTY
OVER THE WAY

07:21.980 --> 07:23.641
THE YOUNGER PUT YOU
OUT OF THE PARK?

07:23.650 --> 07:24.799
BUT UNDERSTAND THIS.

07:24.810 --> 07:26.187
YOU COME TO THAT PARTY,

07:26.190 --> 07:28.818
YOU AND I WILL
HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.060
OH, IT'S
LIKE THAT?

07:30.070 --> 07:31.231
WHEN IT COME TO
THE JAMES FAMILY,

07:31.240 --> 07:32.605
HELL, YEAH,
IT'S LIKE THAT.

07:32.610 --> 07:34.237
NOBODY CAN TOUCH THEM.

07:50.050 --> 07:52.041
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD
MOVE THE PARTY, MAN.

07:52.050 --> 07:54.633
HELL, NO.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.540
LISTEN. TYRONE MAY BE
A LOT OF THINGS,

07:56.550 --> 07:57.961
BUT ONE THING HE AIN'T

07:57.970 --> 08:00.632
IS STUPID ENOUGH
TO CROSS ME.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.881
PARTY STAYS.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.551
COME ON, MAN,
WHERE WERE WE?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.922
WHAT Y'ALL
DOING HERE?

08:39.470 --> 08:42.679
THE HELL WRONG
WITH YOU?

08:42.679 --> 08:43.977
NOTHING.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.186
TYRONE: ME, MALIK,
AND PREACH

08:45.190 --> 08:46.180
JUST KICKED IT
WITH THE PASTOR

08:46.190 --> 08:47.601
AT THAT CHURCH ON 39th.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.430
APPARENTLY, SOMEBODY
KEEP BREAKING IN

08:49.440 --> 08:51.181
AND STEALING FROM
THE COLLECTION PLATE.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.521
AND THEY NEED
OUR PROTECTION?

08:52.530 --> 08:54.567
EITHER US OR THEM
BOYS FROM HOOVER.

08:54.570 --> 08:56.356
WAIT. PASTOR GOT
TWO SETS

08:56.360 --> 08:57.907
BIDDING FOR
HIS PROTECTION?

08:57.910 --> 08:59.366
JUST BECAUSE HE'S
A MAN OF GOD

08:59.370 --> 09:01.486
DON'T MAKE HIM
PERFECT, COOP.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.902
HE HAS HIS
FLAWS AND SECRETS

09:03.910 --> 09:05.366
LIKE THE REST OF US.

09:07.170 --> 09:08.911
YOU REAL CHATTY
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.206
TYRONE: FOCUS, COOP.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.416
YOU GREW UP
IN CHURCH, RIGHT?

09:11.420 --> 09:12.831
I NEED YOU
TO GO DOWN THERE

09:12.840 --> 09:14.547
AND KEEP THAT PASTOR'S
HEAD RIGHT.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.928
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S COOL.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.046
GOOD.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.677
THIS FOR
DILLON'S PARTY?

09:23.350 --> 09:24.340
WHY YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

09:24.350 --> 09:25.840
LIKE WHAT?

09:25.850 --> 09:28.182
LIKE I WOULD SHOOT UP A
KIDS' PARTY OR SOMETHING.

09:28.190 --> 09:31.012
I AIN'T DONE THAT
IN YEARS.

09:31.020 --> 09:34.069
I'M PLAYING.
DAMN.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.947
BESIDES,
AIN'T LIKE TY

09:35.950 --> 09:38.157
TRYING TO PISS OFF THE
BIG HOMIE FLIP, YOU FEEL ME?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.401
WHAT YOU SAY?

09:40.410 --> 09:41.787
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT FLIP

09:41.790 --> 09:43.747
OR THAT LITTLE WONK-ASS
FOOTBALL KID.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.707
I'M GONNA HANDLE THAT
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.507
MAN: THROW YOUR PRIDE
TO THE WIND

09:55.510 --> 09:56.796
SEE ME START A TREND

09:56.800 --> 09:58.461
YOU A DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS

09:58.470 --> 09:59.881
UH, LIKE THIS

09:59.890 --> 10:01.801
YOU AIN'T GOT A CHANCE
IN THIS DANCE

10:01.810 --> 10:04.768
YOU BETTER DANCE IN THIS,
I MEAN THAT

10:04.770 --> 10:06.670
WANT TO SEE
YOUR HANDS IN THIS

10:06.680 --> 10:09.342
GOT ABOUT A GRAND ON MY WRIST,
YOU SEE THAT

10:09.350 --> 10:11.148
TIME FLY MY ASSOCIATES, TOO

10:11.150 --> 10:13.562
I DON'T NEED JUSTIFICATION,
I GET CREDIT FROM THE CREW

10:13.570 --> 10:15.891
I'M PHAT, NOTIFICATIONS
FROM THE 'GRAM COME THROUGH

10:15.900 --> 10:18.358
TELLING ME WHAT YOU LIKE
WHEN I KNOW IT AIN'T TRUE

10:18.360 --> 10:19.816
THEY'RE JUST WATCHING ME...

10:19.820 --> 10:21.231
HEY.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.446
YOU SERIOUSLY
TURNED MY HOUSE

10:22.450 --> 10:23.940
INTO A PRIVATE CASINO?

10:23.950 --> 10:25.782
IT-IT'S JUST
A FEW FRIENDS.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.406
YOUR FRIENDS BETTER
BE OUT OF HERE

10:27.410 --> 10:31.369
IN 10 MINUTES OR I'M
CALLING THE COPS.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.450
GO.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.167
MAN: ...HUSH, LITTLE BABY

10:41.340 --> 10:43.422
SO, THIS WAS
YOUR PLAN.

10:43.430 --> 10:45.137
THE SEQUEL TO
"MOLLY'S GAME"?

10:45.140 --> 10:46.266
I FIGURED IT'D BE
A PRETTY QUICK WAY

10:46.270 --> 10:47.726
TO SCOOP UP
A LITTLE CASH.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.301
ASHER, YOU BROUGHT
STRANGERS INTO MY HOME.

10:50.310 --> 10:51.766
I'M SORRY.

10:51.770 --> 10:53.260
I-I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WOULDN'T MIND,

10:53.270 --> 10:55.102
SINCE YOU THROW EPIC PARTIES
HERE ALL THE TIME.

10:55.110 --> 10:56.180
LOOK, WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST ASK

10:56.190 --> 10:58.067
FOR MY PERMISSION?

10:58.070 --> 11:01.199
I WAS SCARED
YOU'D SAY NO.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.020
BUT, HEY,
IT WORKED OUT.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.077
I-I CLEARED
ENOUGH MONEY

11:04.080 --> 11:05.150
FOR FIRST AND LAST
MONTH'S RENT

11:05.160 --> 11:06.400
AT MY OWN PLACE.

11:06.410 --> 11:07.946
ASHER, EVEN IF
YOU FIND A PLACE,

11:07.950 --> 11:10.032
YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY
THE OTHER MONTHS' RENT.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.327
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
COVER THAT?

11:12.330 --> 11:14.207
LOOK, I THINK
YOU SHOULD

11:14.210 --> 11:16.838
REACH OUT
TO YOUR DAD.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.626
IF YOU EXTEND
THE OLIVE BRANCH FIRST--

11:18.630 --> 11:21.964
HE ALREADY REACHED OUT
TO ME, LEILA.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.597
I'M BACK ON
A WINNING TEAM

11:23.600 --> 11:24.795
MAKING A RUN
FOR STATE.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.054
OF COURSE HE
WANTS ME BACK NOW.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.346
HIS LOVE IS...

11:31.100 --> 11:32.727
CONDITIONAL.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.186
I DON'T NEED HIM.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.976
I'll FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.833
COOP AND GRACE: HAPPY
BIRTHDAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

11:56.840 --> 11:59.081
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

11:59.090 --> 12:01.081
COOP: HAPPY BIRTHDAY
GRACE: HAPPY, HAPPY

12:01.090 --> 12:03.969
COOP: HAPPY BIRTHDAY
GRACE: HAPPY, HAPPY

12:03.970 --> 12:06.177
COOP AND GRACE: HAPPY
BIRTHDAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

12:06.180 --> 12:07.841
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAPPY

12:07.850 --> 12:10.558
SPENCER: I'll GET IT.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.938
GRACE: HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

12:12.940 --> 12:15.261
GRACE: HAPPY, HAPPY
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

12:15.270 --> 12:17.011
COOP: BIRTHDAY BOY.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.068
GRACE: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

12:19.070 --> 12:20.811
COOP: HE'S,
LIKE, 20 NOW?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.021
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE, MAN?

12:25.030 --> 12:26.191
EASY, SPENCER.
I DIDN'T

12:26.200 --> 12:27.520
COME HERE
FOR ALL THAT.

12:27.530 --> 12:28.827
I JUST WANT TO GIVE
DILLON HIS GIFT.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.150
COME ON, MAN,
DON'T BE THAT DUDE.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.241
-WHAT DUDE?
-PRESENTS OVER PRESENCE?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.399
WE DON'T NEED
YOUR GIFTS

12:32.410 --> 12:33.912
AROUND HERE, AIGHT?
WE GOOD.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.160
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
MIGHT THINK DIFFERENTLY.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.660
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE BACK.

12:36.670 --> 12:39.241
AND IT'S PROBABLY BEST
WE KEEP IT THAT WAY.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.332
LOOK, I KNOW I
SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.160
I'M SORRY.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.673
WHICH TIME ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:45.680 --> 12:48.001
WHEN YOU LEFT US
8 YEARS AGO?

12:48.010 --> 12:49.307
WHEN YOU CAME BACK
TO L.A. A YEAR AGO

12:49.310 --> 12:50.675
AND STILL
DIDN'T CALL?

12:50.680 --> 12:52.842
OR WHEN YOU CAME
BACK A FEW YEARS AGO

12:52.850 --> 12:54.841
TO INTERVIEW FOR THE HEAD
COACH POSITION AT BEVERLY?

12:54.850 --> 12:56.841
-YOU GONNA LET ME GET A WORD IN?
“HELL, NO!

12:59.270 --> 13:01.602
IF YOU TRULY
CARED ABOUT US,

13:01.610 --> 13:03.430
YOU WOULD NOT
BE HERE TODAY.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.275
SO, LET DILLON

13:07.280 --> 13:10.079
HAVE HIS
SPECIAL DAY, AIGHT?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.991
COREY: MAN.
SPENCER: NOW, GO AHEAD, MAN.

13:24.090 --> 13:26.878
MAN: LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME,
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME

13:26.880 --> 13:29.042
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME,
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME

13:29.050 --> 13:31.929
IF ANYBODY TELL YOU ANY
DIFFERENT, THEY A LIE

13:31.930 --> 13:33.671
I THOUGHT JORDAN WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.478
HE IS.
HE JUST WANTED

13:35.480 --> 13:37.721
TO STOP BY AND SEE
YOUR DAD FIRST.

13:37.730 --> 13:38.640
WHAT?

13:38.650 --> 13:40.266
IT'S OK, JUST--

13:40.270 --> 13:41.726
JUST LET IT GO, OK?

13:41.730 --> 13:43.220
BILLY: YEAH.
HEY-HEY-HEY-HEY!

13:43.230 --> 13:45.107
IT'S THE
BIRTHDAY BOY.

13:45.110 --> 13:46.692
THANKS!

13:46.700 --> 13:48.486
SO, DO I SHAKE
OR DO I NOT?

13:48.490 --> 13:49.616
DEFINITELY
DO NOT SHAKE.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.610
DO NOT SHAKE.

13:50.620 --> 13:51.610
EXPENSIVE, HUH?

13:52.620 --> 13:53.826
THERE HE IS.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.457
HEY, HEY, HEY.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.282
WOW. FOR SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T LIKE BIRTHDAY PARTIES,

13:58.290 --> 13:59.416
THIS ONE IS
PRETTY AMAZING.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.319
BILLY:
I HEARD THAT.

14:00.330 --> 14:01.411
LET'S GO PUT THOSE DOWN.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.660
DILLON: OK. YEAH.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.377
MAN: ...LET'S HAVE
A GOOD TIME

14:04.380 --> 14:06.667
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME,
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME

14:06.670 --> 14:07.717
WHAT'S UP, COACH?

14:07.720 --> 14:08.790
YOU'RE GOOD.
I JUST WANT TO

14:08.800 --> 14:10.086
CHECK UP ON YOU.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.546
I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN JUGGLING A LOT

14:11.550 --> 14:13.211
WITH YOUR POPS BACK
AND EVERYTHING, SO...

14:13.220 --> 14:14.551
YEAH, HE
STOPPED BY TODAY.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.551
FOR REAL?
HOW WAS THAT?

14:16.560 --> 14:18.016
IT WAS BRIEF.
YOU KNOW ME.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.840
I AIN'T DOWN
WITH THE NONSENSE.

14:19.850 --> 14:21.761
RIGHT, WELL,
LISTEN.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.647
IF YOU EVER DO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT HIM,

14:23.650 --> 14:24.856
AND NOT SO...

14:24.860 --> 14:26.521
AIN'T MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.986
HOLD UP.
I GET IT.

14:27.990 --> 14:29.310
YOU KNOW I'M HERE
FOR YOU, RIGHT?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.446
I GOT YOU.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.565
RIGHT?
HEAR ME?

14:31.570 --> 14:33.572
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU.

14:33.580 --> 14:34.615
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.440
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.099
GOOD. I SEE YOU
TURNED UP... EXCUSE ME.

15:08.610 --> 15:10.567
IS THIS A NEWSPAPER?

15:10.570 --> 15:11.731
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE
OF THESE IN YEARS.

15:11.740 --> 15:12.810
YOU STILL GET THESE?

15:12.820 --> 15:14.527
WHAT ELSE
DON'T YOU SEE?

15:16.490 --> 15:18.197
YOUR NAME
IN THE HEADLINE.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.702
"SPENCER JAMES SHINES

15:21.710 --> 15:24.532
AS BEVERLY
TROUNCES TARZANA."

15:24.540 --> 15:26.702
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.121
SPENCER HAD
A GREAT GAME,

15:28.130 --> 15:29.620
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
THROWING TO HIM.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.507
OK, BUT SPENCER
DID IT

15:31.510 --> 15:32.887
ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE BALL.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.631
OK? AND HE'S DIVISION
PLAYER OF THE YEAR.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.051
YOU'RE THE
QUARTERBACK, SON.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.596
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT POSITION

15:37.600 --> 15:38.806
ON THE FIELD.

15:38.810 --> 15:40.130
STEP ONE OF OUR PLAN

15:40.140 --> 15:41.722
WAS GETTING YOU
TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

15:41.730 --> 15:44.142
STEP TWO
IS OWNING IT.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.720
AS DYNAMIC AS
SPENCER MAY BE,

15:45.730 --> 15:47.562
IT'S YOUR TEAM, JORDAN.

15:47.570 --> 15:50.562
THERE'S NO "I"
IN TEAM, G.W.

15:58.910 --> 16:02.119
YOU'RE TOO
COMFORTABLE, SON,

16:02.120 --> 16:06.000
AND THAT'S
NO FAULT OF YOURS.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.128
YOU WERE RAISED
THAT WAY,

16:08.130 --> 16:10.007
GIVEN A SEAT
AT THE TABLE.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.219
SPENCER,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

16:13.220 --> 16:16.542
HAD TO FIGHT
FOR HIS SEAT,

16:16.550 --> 16:18.962
AS DO MOST OF US
BLACK MEN.

16:18.970 --> 16:22.850
FROM THE WATTS RIOTS,
TO VIETNAM,

16:22.850 --> 16:25.854
TO MY
EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.898
YOU WERE
IN THE WATTS RIOTS?

16:28.900 --> 16:31.312
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

16:31.320 --> 16:34.403
HUH. HOW MUCH
TIME YOU GOT?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.026
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A PARTY TO GO TO.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.486
GROWING UP
IN BEVERLY HILLS,

16:37.490 --> 16:40.573
WE DON'T GET TAUGHT MUCH
ABOUT OUR BLACK HISTORY.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.992
SO, YEAH.
THE PARTY CAN WAIT.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.082
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S YOURS.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.583
AH, YOU WANT... THIS IS
YOURS. YOU WANTED BLUE...

16:51.590 --> 16:52.751
WHERE
THE GIFTS GO?

16:54.800 --> 16:58.179
MICAH! HEY!
YOU'RE HERE!

16:58.180 --> 17:00.501
I AM.
DILLON INVITED ME.

17:00.510 --> 17:02.308
WHICH, IF I HAVE
TO GUESS RIGHT NOW,

17:02.310 --> 17:03.516
YOU HAD NO CLUE.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.726
MM.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.436
IF IT'S TOO MUCH
FOR YOU, I'll LEAVE.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.011
MICAH?
YOU MADE IT!

17:09.020 --> 17:10.260
WE'RE ONE MAN SHORT.

17:10.270 --> 17:11.896
HOW GOOD ARE YOU
AT POP GUNS?

17:14.819 --> 17:16.527
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM
AND FIND OUT?

17:16.530 --> 17:18.362
YES! COME ON,
LET'S GO.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.270
COME ON, GUYS.
THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC.

17:25.790 --> 17:29.203
AWW. I LOVE
HER SMILE.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.996
UHH. SOMEBODY IN
THEY FEELINGS?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.911
NO, FOR REAL,
BECAUSE, LIKE,

17:32.920 --> 17:35.628
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
SINCE WE HAD A TIME OUT.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.962
BEEN IN AND OUT
OF SCHOOL.

17:37.970 --> 17:39.176
AND THOSE NIGHTMARES, MAN,

17:39.180 --> 17:40.466
LIKE, THOSE
ARE THE WORST.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.551
I CAN'T WITH THEM.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.550
NIGHTMARES?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.801
YEAH, ABOUT
SHAWN'S MURDER.

17:44.810 --> 17:46.437
WHAT, SHE AIN'T
SAID NOTHING?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.432
SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAS
SOME KIND OF PTSD.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.568
PATIENCE: LOOK, THEY DIDN'T
START TILL THIS WEEK.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.607
MAN: YEAH, OK

17:56.610 --> 17:58.658
PUMP IT UP, PUMP IT UP,
PUMP IT UP

17:58.660 --> 18:00.822
RUN IT UP, RUN IT UP,
JUMP IT UP

18:00.830 --> 18:02.730
CUT ONE, CUT TWO,
SUM IT UP...

18:02.740 --> 18:04.651
MICAH.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.458
HEY, SPENCER.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.030
LISTEN, MAN,
I'M SORRY ABOUT HOW

18:08.040 --> 18:09.030
THINGS WENT DOWN
THE OTHER NIGHT

18:09.040 --> 18:10.667
AT THE HOUSE.

18:10.670 --> 18:11.660
I GUESS I WAS
JUST MEAN.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.081
SON...

18:14.710 --> 18:16.292
I WAS LIKE THAT
WITH MY MOM.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.581
SPENCER: SHE LIKE THAT
AT EVERY PARTY.

18:20.590 --> 18:21.967
WON'T STOP
TILL SHE KNOWS

18:21.970 --> 18:23.677
EVERYBODY TAKEN
CARE OF.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.342
EHH. YOU SURE?

18:26.350 --> 18:27.932
I FIGURED MY BEING HERE
MADE HER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE,

18:27.940 --> 18:30.682
SO IT WAS HER WAY OF
AVOIDING ME, YOU KNOW?

18:30.690 --> 18:32.681
INVITE CAME FROM DILLON.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.317
AH.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.150
HEY, LISTEN,
HANG IN THERE

18:44.160 --> 18:45.286
WITH MY MOMS,
ALL RIGHT?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.997
SHE LIKES YOU.

A PIECE OF CAKE.

19:00.930 --> 19:02.295
YOU AIN'T GOTTA

19:02.300 --> 19:03.540

19:03.550 --> 19:05.132
THIS JOB I'M ABOUT

19:05.140 --> 19:06.426
NIGHTMARES

19:06.430 --> 19:07.727
NIGHTMARES IS

19:18.150 --> 19:19.481

ON YOUR FACE, COOP.

19:19.490 --> 19:20.605
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

19:20.610 --> 19:21.736
WE COULD FIGURE OUT
SOME OTHER WAY

19:21.740 --> 19:22.775
TO DEAL WITH
TYRONE, AIGHT,

19:22.780 --> 19:23.770
AND YOU KNOW
I'M RIGHT.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.986
IT AIN'T THAT EASY.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.071
NAH, YOU KNOW
WHAT AIN'T EASY?

19:26.080 --> 19:27.150
KNOWING MY
BEST FRIEND'S LIFE

19:27.160 --> 19:28.491
IS HEADED
FOR A BOX.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.070
EITHER A PINE ONE
OR A 6-BY-8 CELL.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.741
YOU REALLY WANT THAT
FOR YOURSELF?

19:31.750 --> 19:33.661
PREACH:

19:55.610 --> 19:58.068
I CAN'T MAKE THIS
MOVE WITH YOU.

19:58.070 --> 20:00.232
IF YOU DON'T DO
THIS JOB FOR TYRONE,

20:00.240 --> 20:03.107
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HE'S GONNA REACT.

20:03.110 --> 20:06.660

20:24.890 --> 20:27.427
TO TAKE DOWN TYRONE?

20:27.430 --> 20:30.980
YEAH, I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT THEY ARE.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.379
IS IT COOL

20:32.390 --> 20:34.142

20:49.370 --> 20:51.156
THANK YOU.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.366
LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S CAUGHT

20:52.370 --> 20:54.361
IN CANDY WASTE.
HA HA HA!

20:56.250 --> 20:57.957
SPENCER: READY?
LEILA: YEAH.

21:02.170 --> 21:05.049
YO, SPENCE.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.212

21:07.220 --> 21:08.927
THANKS FOR THE BEST
BIRTHDAY EVER.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.675
ALWAYS.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.647
SO...

21:25.650 --> 21:27.448
SO?

21:27.450 --> 21:29.236
YOU SURE YOU CAN'T
HANG FOR A BIT?

21:29.240 --> 21:31.038
THAT DEPENDS.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.862
IS ROOMIE
STILL HERE?

21:33.870 --> 21:36.032
NOT FOR LONG.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.576
ASHER LEFT THE DOOR

21:37.580 --> 21:38.786
OPEN AGAIN.

21:45.050 --> 21:47.178
OH, MY GOD.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.670
I'VE BEEN ROBBED.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.346
LEILA: THEY PICKED
THROUGH THE WHOLE PLACE.

21:57.350 --> 22:01.685
THEY TOOK ART
AND JEWELRY AND TVs.

22:01.690 --> 22:03.977
THEY EVEN TOOK
MY DAD'S SAFE.

22:06.030 --> 22:07.737
LOOKS LIKE YOUR SECURITY
CAMERAS ARE DOWN.

22:07.740 --> 22:09.060
THEY WERE? NO,

22:09.070 --> 22:10.481
I ALWAYS
LEAVE THEM ON.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.946
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY
WERE TAMPERED WITH.

22:11.950 --> 22:14.157
THE WHOLE SECURITY
SYSTEM WAS JUST OFF.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.400
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

22:15.410 --> 22:16.571
PLACE WAS ROBBED.

22:16.580 --> 22:17.570
YOU LIVE HERE?

22:17.580 --> 22:18.911
KIND OF.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.332
UH, YEAH,
HE--HE DOES.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.580
OFFICER: ONE OF YOUR
NEIGHBORS THINKS

22:22.590 --> 22:24.297
SHE SAW 3
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN

22:24.300 --> 22:25.790
HANGING AROUND
THE AREA EARLIER.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.790
SHE GET
A DESCRIPTION?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.086
ALL 3 MEDIUM BUILD.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.580
ONE WAS WEARING
A RED T-SHIRT.

22:29.590 --> 22:31.592
THE OTHER TWO
HAD ON HOODIES.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.841
EXCUSE ME.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.596
BABY, I'M REAL
SORRY, BUT

22:37.600 --> 22:39.227
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
STEP OUT REAL QUICK.

22:39.230 --> 22:40.300
WHAT? RIGHT NOW?

22:40.310 --> 22:43.393
I WON'T BE GONE LONG.
I PROMISE.

22:49.030 --> 22:51.192
DON'T LEAVE
HER SIDE.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.032
COOP, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

23:05.090 --> 23:07.457
SO MUCH FOR MAKING IT
TO THE PARTY, HUH?

23:07.460 --> 23:09.588
YEAH, IT'S--
THAT'S MY BAD.

23:09.590 --> 23:11.718
YOU BEEN WITH GRANDPA
WILLIE THIS WHOLE TIME?

23:11.720 --> 23:13.461
OK, HERE WE
GO AGAIN.

23:13.470 --> 23:14.801
DON'T DO THAT,
DON'T DO THAT.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.380
NOW, YOU MADE
A COMMITMENT

23:16.390 --> 23:18.552
THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO
DILLON AND TO SPENCER.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.267
AND DIDN'T
COME THROUGH.

23:20.270 --> 23:21.840
NOT TO MENTION,
THAT MAN

23:21.850 --> 23:23.181
INTENTIONALLY
HURT SPENCER,

23:23.190 --> 23:24.396
YOUR FRIEND, IN ORDER

23:24.400 --> 23:25.640
TO GIVE YOU
YOUR LITTLE SHOT.

23:25.650 --> 23:27.778
DAD, GRANDPA WILLIE

23:27.780 --> 23:29.100
ALREADY EXPLAINED
ALL THAT, OK?

23:29.110 --> 23:30.487
HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO STEP ON SPENCER.

23:30.490 --> 23:32.527
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG.

23:32.530 --> 23:34.692
THAT MAN MEANT IT.

23:34.700 --> 23:35.940
EVERYTHING WENT DOWN

23:35.950 --> 23:39.363
EXACTLY THE WAY
HE WANTED IT TO.

23:39.370 --> 23:41.577
NOW, YOU GOTTA
ASK YOURSELF--

23:41.580 --> 23:44.072
IS THIS HOW YOU WANT TO
GET YOUR WINS IN LIFE?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.299
BY STEPPING ON
YOUR FRIENDS? HUH?

23:48.670 --> 23:50.217
ASK YOURSELF THAT.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.836
I GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.936
SO, LAY IT ON ME.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.066
WHY DID YOU WANT TO HAVE

24:07.070 --> 24:08.686
THIS MEETING
IN MY OFFICE?

24:08.690 --> 24:11.273
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
THIS WAS ALMOST MY OFFICE.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.568
SO,
HAD YOU GOTTEN THE JOB,

24:14.570 --> 24:16.618
WOULD YOU HAVE CONTACTED
YOUR KIDS THEN?

24:16.620 --> 24:17.690
I'M NOT PROUD
OF THE WAY 1

24:17.700 --> 24:19.828
GHOSTED ON MY FAMILY.

24:19.830 --> 24:22.367
BUT GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AT THAT TIME,

24:22.370 --> 24:24.748
IT FELT LIKE
THE ONLY THING TO DO.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.036
LEAVING YOUR KIDS
FELT LIKE

24:26.040 --> 24:27.337
THE ONLY OPTION?

24:27.340 --> 24:30.128
NOT THAT I OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION,

24:30.130 --> 24:31.666
BUT I WAS YOUNG.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.626
I WAS HURTING.

24:32.630 --> 24:33.961
I DIDN'T SAY
I WAS RIGHT.

24:33.970 --> 24:36.177
WHY ARE YOU
BACK NOW, COREY?

24:46.310 --> 24:50.019
I MISSED MY FAMILY.
ALWAYS HAVE.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.146
JUST NEVER SEEMED TO
FIND THE RIGHT TIME

24:52.150 --> 24:53.640
TO PICK UP THE PHONE.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.732
AND THEN WHEN
WILLIE CALLED,

24:57.740 --> 24:59.788
I REALIZED THAT IF I

24:59.790 --> 25:02.282
KEPT WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT TIME,

25:02.290 --> 25:04.076
I'D BE WAITING FOREVER.

25:05.620 --> 25:09.454
YOU AND MY SON HAVE
GOTTEN REALLY CLOSE.

25:09.460 --> 25:10.871
HE TRUSTS YOU.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.759
HE LISTENS TO YOU.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.388
OK. WHERE IS
THIS GOING?

25:16.390 --> 25:18.757
I JUST WANT TO
SIT DOWN WITH HIM.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.671
FOR HIM
TO HEAR ME OUT.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.886
WELL, IF
SPENCER DOESN'T

25:21.890 --> 25:23.676
WANT TO SIT DOWN
WITH YOU,

25:23.680 --> 25:25.136
I CAN'T MAKE HIM.

25:26.690 --> 25:28.761
YOU MUST BE FORGETTING
THAT I HAVE THE POWER

25:28.770 --> 25:30.568
TO UPEND YOUR
HAPPY LIFE.

25:35.780 --> 25:37.487
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.151
WHEN IT COMES
TO SPENCER,

25:45.160 --> 25:47.162
I AM NOT GOING
TO FORCE HIM

25:47.170 --> 25:48.240
TO DO ANYTHING
THAT'S NOT

25:48.250 --> 25:51.459
IN HIS BEST INTEREST.

25:51.460 --> 25:52.791
AND BE HONEST--
IF YOU REALLY WANTED

25:52.800 --> 25:55.167
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT,

25:55.170 --> 25:56.626
THEN YOU'D LET
ALL THIS WORK OUT

25:56.630 --> 25:57.711
IN ITS OWN TIME.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.461
YOU CAN SEE
YOUR WAY OUT.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.142
LAURA: SO, I LOOKED UP
ALL THE NAMES YOU GAVE ME.

26:12.150 --> 26:16.030
THIS IS THE RAP SHEET
ON CORDELL "PREACH" SIMS.

26:16.030 --> 26:18.271
ACTUALLY HAD A PROMISING
CAREER IN BASKETBALL

26:18.280 --> 26:21.272
BEFORE GETTING ROPED
INTO A LIFE OF CRIME.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.907
ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN
HIM AND TYRONE?

26:22.910 --> 26:24.867
NOTHING I COULD FIND,

26:24.870 --> 26:26.827
BUT I DID FIND
A CONNECTION TO SHAWN.

26:26.830 --> 26:28.241
MY SHAWN?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.628
SHAWN'S BROTHER, ACTUALLY.
BRANDON SCOTT.

26:30.630 --> 26:34.453
TURNS OUT PREACH AND SCOTT
SERVED TIME TOGETHER

26:34.460 --> 26:36.758
ON TWO SEPARATE INSTANCES.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.297
IT'S ON RECORD THAT PREACH
WAS OFFERED A DEAL

26:39.300 --> 26:41.849
TO TESTIFY AGAINST BRANDON
AND REFUSED.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.217
COOP: SO, PREACH
A LOYAL DUDE.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.848
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

26:46.850 --> 26:48.841
NOT THAT GOOD, ACTUALLY.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.841
GETTING HIM
TO TURN ON TYRONE

26:50.850 --> 26:53.148
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY.

26:53.150 --> 26:55.562
MAYBE NOT.
BUT THANK YOU.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.857
-YOU'RE WELCOME.
-I APPRECIATE IT.

26:57.860 --> 27:00.488
KEEP ME
POSTED, OK?

27:00.490 --> 27:01.696
HEY.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.771
SPENCER: HEY, MS. BAKER.
WHAT'S UP?

27:03.780 --> 27:06.283
GOOD. YOU'RE STILL HERE.
WE GOTTA TALK.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.906
COOP: WHAT'S UP?
SPENCER: TYRONE AND HIS DUDES

27:07.910 --> 27:09.492
ROBBED LEILA'S HOUSE.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.820
WHAT?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.320
YOU CALLED IT, COOP.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.377
YOU SAID HE WAS
GONNA COME AFTER ME

27:13.380 --> 27:14.541
IF I THREW
THAT PARTY.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.790
THIS IS HIM
COMING AFTER ME.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.006
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S TYRONE?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.330
THE MAIN SUSPECT
WAS A BLACK DUDE,

27:18.340 --> 27:19.876
MEDIUM BUILD, WITH
A RED T-SHIRT ON.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.041
THAT'S IT?

27:21.050 --> 27:22.131
IT AIN'T
ROCKET SCIENCE, COOP.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.210
WHAT ELSE DO I NEED?

27:23.220 --> 27:24.290
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE A ACTUAL

27:24.300 --> 27:25.552
REAL DESCRIPTION.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.925
BURGLARY IS NOT
TYRONE'S THING.

27:26.930 --> 27:28.170
ESPECIALLY NOT
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.306
THEY HIT UP
LEILA'S HOUSE, COOP,

27:29.310 --> 27:30.721
WHERE SHE'S
STAYING ALONE.

27:30.730 --> 27:32.516
YOU STILL GOT TYRONE'S
BACK AFTER THAT?

27:32.520 --> 27:35.103
I WOULD NEVER HAVE HIS BACK
OVER YOURS AND YOU KNOW THAT.

27:35.110 --> 27:36.817
I'M JUST POINTING
OUT THE FACTS.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.606
DAMN! YOU'VE BEEN IN
BEVERLY HILLS ALL OF A MINUTE,

27:38.610 --> 27:40.317
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
PROFILING YOUR OWN PEOPLE?

27:40.320 --> 27:42.778
HEY, I'M CRENSHAW, RIDE
OR DIE, AND YOU KNOW THAT.

27:42.780 --> 27:45.613
IT DAMN SURE DON'T
SEEM LIKE IT.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.826
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:46.830 --> 27:48.616
YOU AIN'T GONNA TALK
TO TYRONE, I WILL!

28:05.890 --> 28:08.769
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
MY SECURITY CAMERAS BEING OFF?

28:12.310 --> 28:14.722
LOOK,
I'M SORRY, LEILA.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.812
IT'S HIGH-STAKES POKER.
IT'S NOT EXACTLY LEGAL.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.640
I COULDN'T RISK
ANYTHING BEING LEAKED.

28:18.650 --> 28:20.937
SO, BECAUSE OF THAT,
NOT ONLY ARE

28:20.940 --> 28:22.601
THE BURGLARS
STILL ON THE LOOSE,

28:22.610 --> 28:25.272
IT'S LIKELY BURGLARS YOU
BROUGHT INTO THIS HOUSE

28:25.280 --> 28:27.521
FOR YOUR STUPID
POKER WHATEVER?

28:27.530 --> 28:30.158
LEILA, I WOULD NEVER BRING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT INTO YOUR HOME.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.321
LEILA: BUT YOU DID.
ASHER: NO!

28:31.330 --> 28:33.071
I HAD A POKER GAME
WITH FRIENDS.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.822
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNEW
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WAS HERE?

28:35.830 --> 28:41.041
SO ARE WE GONNA IGNORE THE OBVIOUS
HERE ON PURPOSE? HMM, LET'S SEE.

28:41.050 --> 28:44.088
SPENCER HAS BEEN FIGHTING WITH THE
GANGS IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD. SPENCER--

28:44.090 --> 28:46.923
NO. DON'T YOU DARE.
SPENCER HAS NEVER

28:46.930 --> 28:49.888
BROUGHT DANGER INTO MY
HOME. CAN YOU SAY THE SAME?

28:49.890 --> 28:52.882
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU
PACK YOUR STUFF, ASH.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.607
ARE YOU KICKING ME OUT?

28:58.610 --> 29:01.739
I'M SORRY. THERE IS A DARK,
ROUGH SIDE TO CRENSHAW,

29:01.740 --> 29:05.563
BUT THERE IS A DARK, ROUGH
SIDE TO BEVERLY HILLS, TOO,

29:05.570 --> 29:07.561
AND YOUR FRIENDS
JUST PROVED THAT.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.868
SPENCER: HEY!

29:14.870 --> 29:17.248
TY!

29:17.250 --> 29:18.832
YOU MUST BE LOST, HOMIE.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.798
I GOT TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING, MAN, MAN-TO-MAN.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.086
MY GIRL'S HOUSE
WAS ROBBED TODAY.

29:23.090 --> 29:24.580
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

29:24.590 --> 29:27.252
LEILA YOUR GIRL, RIGHT?

29:27.260 --> 29:30.093
REDBONE, LONG HAIR,

29:30.100 --> 29:31.761
FLY-ASS CRIB
IN BEVERLY HILLS?

29:31.770 --> 29:35.308
HEY, IT'S ONE THING TO
THREATEN ME, BUT MY GIRL?

29:35.310 --> 29:38.519
IT AIN'T HOW WE HANDLE
PROBLEMS, HOMIE--

29:38.520 --> 29:40.477
YOU GOT ME CONFUSED, BRO.

29:40.480 --> 29:44.189
I AIN'T SHAWN. I'll PUT YOUR ASS DOWN
LIKE A DOG AND WON'T THINK TWICE.

29:44.190 --> 29:47.273
MATTER OF FACT...

29:47.280 --> 29:50.523
YOU AIN'T BEEN NOTHING
BUT PROBLEMS LATELY.

29:50.530 --> 29:52.032
WE'RE GONNA
END THAT NOW.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.111
COREY: HEY!

29:54.120 --> 29:55.997
I ALREADY CALLED THE COPS,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.322
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL MY SON,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KILL ME, TOO.

29:59.330 --> 30:02.334
GOOD LUCK EXPLAINING BOTH
OF OUR BODIES TO 5-0.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.807
YOU GOT LUCKY
THIS TIME.

30:24.070 --> 30:26.107
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF ME, MAN.

30:26.110 --> 30:27.271
I DIDN'T NEED YOUR
HELP, ALL RIGHT?

30:27.280 --> 30:28.270
IT DIDN'T LOOK
THAT WAY TO ME.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.862
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

30:29.870 --> 30:31.986
COOP CALLED YOUR MOM
SCARED YOU WERE COMING HERE.

30:31.990 --> 30:35.745
YOUR MOM CALLED ME.
THAT'S HOW WORRIED SHE WAS.

30:35.750 --> 30:39.459
A NORMAL PERSON WOULD
SAY THANK YOU RIGHT NOW!

30:39.460 --> 30:41.201
I GUESS I AIN'T
NORMAL, THEN.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.147
HEY.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.970
I HEARD ABOUT LEILA'S.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.937
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
HER ALONE TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

31:04.940 --> 31:07.489
SO IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,
I'M GONNA SLEEP ON THAT COUCH.

31:07.490 --> 31:12.235
WHOA...I ALSO HEARD
ABOUT TYRONE.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.480
ANYTHING I NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT?

31:13.490 --> 31:15.697
TODAY WAS ON ME.
I WAS SO FOCUSED

31:15.700 --> 31:17.327
ON THROWING DILLON THE
PERFECT BIRTHDAY PARTY

31:17.330 --> 31:20.072
THAT I GOT
TOO COMFORTABLE.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.244
I LET MY BEEF
WITH TYRONE AFFECT LEILA.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.459
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IT
WAS TYRONE OR ANYBODY ELSE YOU KNOW.

31:27.460 --> 31:29.121
SPENCER: YOU SOUND LIKE COOP.
BILLY: HEH HEH!

31:29.130 --> 31:31.542
SOME WORDS I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D HEAR.

31:31.550 --> 31:34.713
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
MAYBE YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

31:37.140 --> 31:38.972
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO THINK NO MORE.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.051
THAT'S NOT SURPRISING, GIVEN
THE WEEK THAT YOU'VE HAD.

31:41.060 --> 31:43.188
COME ON, THIS AIN'T HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH MY POPS, ALL RIGHT?

31:43.190 --> 31:48.640
OF COURSE IT DOES. SON, YOU ARE
LIKE A WALKING POSTER FOR DENIAL.

31:48.650 --> 31:50.527
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
UPSET WITH COREY.

31:50.530 --> 31:53.022
THAT'S WHY YOU PICKED
A FIGHT WITH TYRONE,

31:53.030 --> 31:56.079
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGHT
WHO YOU'RE REALLY MAD AT.

31:56.080 --> 32:02.201
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T FACE YOUR
DEMONS, THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE.

32:02.210 --> 32:05.589
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

32:05.590 --> 32:08.457
I SHOULD TALK TO MY POPS?
FOR REAL?

32:08.460 --> 32:11.373
UM, I THINK IT'S IN
YOUR BEST INTEREST.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.257
DON'T BECOME LIKE
ME AND MY FATHER.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.478
MAN: SO MUCH FOR LOVE, MAN,
I'M LOOKIN' FOR A FEATURE

32:27.480 --> 32:29.357
YOUR BODY BANGIN',
THAT'S AN ONOMATOPOEIA

32:29.360 --> 32:32.193
IF I PAINT THE PICTURE,
WOULD YOU BE MY MONA LISA?

32:32.200 --> 32:34.237
HELLO?
THIS IS LEILA.

32:34.240 --> 32:38.575
OH, OK. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.

32:38.580 --> 32:41.538
THE COPS FOUND
THE THIEVES.

32:41.540 --> 32:43.360
SOME LOCAL BLING RING
THAT'S BEEN HITTING UP

32:43.370 --> 32:45.281
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR THE PAST MONTH.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.201
I OWE COOP
AN APOLOGY.

32:47.210 --> 32:51.204
HEY, FOR THE RECORD, I NEVER
THOUGHT THIS WAS CONNECTED TO YOU.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.598
HEY, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS WEEKEND.

33:01.600 --> 33:05.309
MY EMOTIONS GOT THE BETTER
OF ME AND I OVERREACTED.

33:05.310 --> 33:07.642
YEAH, IT'S ALL GOOD.

33:07.650 --> 33:11.143
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
COMPROMISED YOUR SAFETY LIKE THAT.

33:11.150 --> 33:13.198
ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T YOU.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.986
SOME BLING RING.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.578
SO, ANYWAY,
MY DOOR IS OPEN.

33:18.580 --> 33:22.619
IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK, YOU CAN
STAY TWO WEEKS, A MONTH, WHATEVER.

33:22.620 --> 33:26.955
I APPRECIATE
THE OFFER, BUT...

33:26.960 --> 33:29.748
YOU KINDA GAVE ME THE
KICK IN THE ASS THAT I NEEDED.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.719
GIVING IT ANOTHER
SHOT WITH MY DAD.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.882
I WON'T KNOW IF HE'S
CHANGED TILL I GO BACK HOME,

33:36.890 --> 33:40.963
BUT...I'M GIVING HIM
A SECOND CHANCE.

33:40.970 --> 33:45.259
UH, THAT'S--
THAT'S AWESOME.

33:45.270 --> 33:46.681
GOOD FOR YOU.

33:50.020 --> 33:52.273
YOU GONNA BE OK BY
YOURSELF IN THAT HOUSE?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.066
OF COURSE.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

33:54.070 --> 33:57.483
FINALLY GET MY PEACE AND
QUIET BACK, MY ALMOND MILK.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.286
HEY, DAD.

34:05.290 --> 34:06.826
HEY, MAN.

34:06.830 --> 34:09.288
I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID.

34:09.290 --> 34:12.339
OH, OK. AND?

34:12.340 --> 34:15.719
YEAH, HE'S
A COMPLICATED MAN

34:15.719 --> 34:18.087
AND OFTEN DOES THE WRONG
THINGS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

34:18.090 --> 34:21.844
A--A BAKER MAN TRAIT,
I'M FIGURING OUT.

34:21.850 --> 34:22.965
HEH!

34:24.889 --> 34:28.440
LOOK, I CAN'T CUT
GRANDPA WILLIE OFF.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.226
OK? NOT THE WAY
THAT YOU WANT ME TO,

34:30.230 --> 34:32.813
AND BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT THE FOOTBALL.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.312
OK? IT'S ABOUT HAVING A
CONNECTION TO MY ROOTS, DAD.

34:35.320 --> 34:38.108
LOOK, YOU MADE A DECISION TO CUT
CRENSHAW OUT OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU FELT

34:38.110 --> 34:39.987
IT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED TO
GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT AND SURVIVE,

34:39.989 --> 34:42.652
AND I GET THAT, OK?
1 DO, BUT...

34:42.659 --> 34:46.449
I FEEL LIKE I NEED THIS CONNECTION
TO CRENSHAW TO GET MY HEAD RIGHT.

34:48.330 --> 34:51.572
AND GRANDPA WILLIE IS
THAT CONNECTION FOR YOU?

34:51.580 --> 34:53.661
YEAH, HE IS.

34:57.170 --> 34:58.376
OK.

35:01.010 --> 35:02.171
OK.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.073
COOP, YOU'RE ON ONE,
WALKING AROUND THE 'HOOD

35:26.080 --> 35:28.993
LIKE TYRONE AIN'T
COMING FOR YOU.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.116
HE'S NOT...

35:31.120 --> 35:34.750
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
ABOUT ME NOT TAKING THAT JOB.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.878
LOOK, I KNOW YOU LIVE
BY A CODE, PREACH,

35:36.880 --> 35:42.330
UNLIKE TYRONE, WHO GOT SHAWN--HIS
BOY--KILLED, ALL BECAUSE HE WANTED OUT.

35:42.340 --> 35:47.426
CAN'T COME AT ME WITH A BOMB
THAT BIG, NOT WITHOUT NO PROOF.

35:47.430 --> 35:49.307
TYRONE KNOW RAY
KILLED SHAWN,

35:49.310 --> 35:52.393
AND HE'S STILL LETTING THAT MAN
WALK AROUND HERE BREATHING?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.437
THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

35:54.440 --> 35:57.398
YOU KNOW SHAWN'S
BROTHER BRANDON?

35:57.400 --> 35:59.892
NOT ONLY DID YOU ALL
SHARE A BUNK IN COUNTY,

35:59.900 --> 36:03.564
<i>BUT YOU ALL PLAYED
AA BASKETBALL TOGETHER.</i>

36:03.570 --> 36:06.278
LOOK, TYRONE MIGHT BE
YOUR HOMEBOY,

36:06.280 --> 36:09.193
BUT BRANDON WAS FAMILY,

36:09.200 --> 36:11.999
WHICH MEANS SHAWN
WAS FAMILY, TOO.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.321
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I
LEARNED ABOUT YOU, PREACH,

36:14.330 --> 36:16.128
IT'S LOYALTY.

36:17.630 --> 36:20.839
THE STRONGER THE LOYALTY,
THE DEEPER THE BOND.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.332
TYRONE HAD
YOUR FAM KILLED.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.342
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT?

36:32.440 --> 36:34.010
HEY.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.107
GOOD LOOKING OUT,
COOP.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.520
SO WHAT NOW?

36:44.530 --> 36:47.238
YOU DID YOUR PART.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.447
ME AND THE HOMIES
GOT IT FROM HERE.

36:49.450 --> 36:52.613
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

36:52.620 --> 36:55.749
EXACTLY WHAT YOU
WANT IT TO MEAN.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.287
TYRONE AIN'T GONNA
BE NOBODY'S PROBLEM.

36:58.290 --> 37:00.338
NO MORE.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.886
GRACE: HEY, BABY.
SPENCER: HEY, MA.

37:13.390 --> 37:16.803
AH. THANKS AGAIN FOR
WATCHING YOUR BROTHER TONIGHT.

37:16.810 --> 37:21.350
ANYTIME. SO HOW'S MICAH?
EVERYTHING GOOD?

37:21.360 --> 37:24.990
BETTER THAN GOOD.

37:28.370 --> 37:30.532
HOW ABOUT YOU?

37:30.540 --> 37:32.360
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

37:32.370 --> 37:33.656
MM-HMM?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.207
MAYBE IT IS TIME I
TALKED TO MY FATHER.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.962
I GOT A LOT
OF QUESTIONS, MA.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.137
AND YOU THINK HE
HAS THE ANSWERS.

37:47.140 --> 37:51.384
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, I WON'T DO IT.

37:51.390 --> 37:53.210
LAST THING I WANT
TO DO IS HURT YOU.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.027
YOU HAVE
MY SUPPORT, BABY.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.316
YOU SURE?

38:03.320 --> 38:04.685
I'M SURE.

38:06.570 --> 38:08.982
SONS NEED
THEIR FATHERS.

38:08.990 --> 38:10.981
IF IT'S OK WITH YOU,
I STILL WANT TO HOLD OFF

38:10.990 --> 38:13.698
ON TELLING DILLON TILL WE
KNOW DAD'S FULL INTENTIONS.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.286
ALL RIGHT.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.336
WAIT. BABY.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.001
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

38:33.350 --> 38:36.172
IT'S SOMETHING I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU A LONG TIME AGO.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.853
I WASN'T COMPLETELY HONEST
AS TO WHY YOUR FATHER LEFT.

38:49.490 --> 38:55.782
MAN: I'VE BEEN FEELING LIKE
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IT ALL

38:55.790 --> 38:59.363
AND I'M LOSING ALL CONTROL

39:01.580 --> 39:07.917
'CAUSE I WISH THAT I COULD
BREAK THE FALL AND SAVE IT ALL

39:07.920 --> 39:11.879
BUT I'VE BEEN HOLDING IT
TOO CLOSE

39:11.890 --> 39:15.849
WISH I KNEW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING

39:15.850 --> 39:19.013
WORDS DON'T COME THAT EASY

39:19.020 --> 39:23.355
WE MIGHT BE BROKEN BY DESIGN

39:23.360 --> 39:26.478
SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER WAY

39:26.480 --> 39:29.359
ANOTHER WAY, ANOTHER WAY

39:29.360 --> 39:32.273
TO KEEP HER SAFE ANOTHER DAY

39:32.280 --> 39:36.945
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER DAY,
IT'S EASIER TO...

39:36.950 --> 39:38.782
I KNOW HOW I'D FEEL IF
THIS HAPPENED TO ME,

39:38.790 --> 39:42.704
SO...I FIGURED YOU MIGHT
NEED A LITTLE COMPANY.

39:42.710 --> 39:46.795
...TO SAY, SAY, SAY

39:46.800 --> 39:49.963
THAN TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY

39:55.050 --> 39:59.260
SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER WAY,
ANOTHER WAY...

39:59.270 --> 40:00.510
COME ON IN.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.431
WHAT WOULD IT COST
FOR ME TO GET YOU OUT

40:02.440 --> 40:04.056
OF MY SON'S LIFE
FOR GOOD?

40:04.060 --> 40:06.518
...ANOTHER DAY,
ANOTHER DAY...

40:06.520 --> 40:07.931
NAME YOUR PRICE.

40:07.940 --> 40:10.989
IT'S EASIER
TO RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY

40:10.990 --> 40:15.575
RUN AWAY THAN TO KNOW
WHAT TO SAY

40:15.580 --> 40:19.744
SAY, SAY

40:26.670 --> 40:28.661
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:28.670 --> 40:31.469
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE

40:31.470 --> 40:33.541
IS 'CAUSE OUT OF ALL THE
PEOPLE THAT'S BETRAYED ME,

40:33.550 --> 40:36.679
YOU THE EASIEST CONVERSATION
FOR ME TO HAVE RIGHT NOW.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.889
SO THE CAT'S
OUT THE BAG.

40:41.600 --> 40:47.107
THE WAY I SEE IT, YOU CAME
BACK FOR ONE OF 3 REASONS:

40:47.110 --> 40:48.851
EITHER YOU LEGITIMATELY
WANT A CHANCE

40:48.860 --> 40:51.989
AT A REAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH ME AND DILLON,

40:51.990 --> 40:55.563
OR YOU WANT BACK IN MY LIFE 'CAUSE
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M ALL OVER THE NEWS

40:55.570 --> 40:58.904
AND YOU REALIZE YOUR SON
IS DESTINED FOR GREATNESS.

41:01.620 --> 41:02.997
OR...

41:05.420 --> 41:09.300
YOU WANT TO BLOW UP MY MOM
AND BILLY'S LIFE AS PAYBACK

41:09.300 --> 41:12.509
FOR HAVING AN AFFAIR WHILE THEY
WERE MARRIED TO YOU AND LAURA.

41:16.970 --> 41:19.507
THAT'S WHY YOU LEFT
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, RIGHT?

41:22.600 --> 41:23.840
CORRECT.

41:25.690 --> 41:27.977
SO WHICH IS IT?

41:32.610 --> 41:34.487
WHY ARE YOU BACK?

42:10.650 --> 42:12.311
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
