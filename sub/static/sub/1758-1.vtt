00:20.972 --> 00:23.107
Feet together, bow.

00:23.108 --> 00:25.244
- Osu!
- Yoi!

00:26.445 --> 00:29.059
A little bit of exercise, a little bit
of basics here today, guys. Ready?

00:29.060 --> 00:32.183
Let's go. Jumping jacks to
start. Go, jumping jacks!

00:32.183 --> 00:34.354
That's it, that's the one.
Pop and snap.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.321
Good stuff. Push-ups! Go, push-ups!

00:37.322 --> 00:39.190
That's it, nice and low.

00:39.191 --> 00:41.158
Try to get that chin
all the way down.

00:41.159 --> 00:42.926
Good stuff. Nice push-up.

00:42.927 --> 00:45.162
Now let's get everyone standing up.

00:45.163 --> 00:47.931
Feet together. Bow.

00:47.932 --> 00:49.133
Osu!

00:49.134 --> 00:51.135
Okay, ready, guys? Single punches.

00:51.136 --> 00:52.669
One!

00:52.670 --> 00:54.238
Two!

00:54.239 --> 00:55.540
Three!

00:55.541 --> 00:56.673
Four!

00:56.674 --> 00:59.143
Five! Six!

00:59.144 --> 01:01.045
Seven.

01:01.046 --> 01:02.513
Eight!

01:02.514 --> 01:04.048
Nine!

01:04.049 --> 01:05.483
Go!

01:06.385 --> 01:07.918
Feet together! Bow!

01:07.919 --> 01:09.453
- Osu.
- Osu!

01:09.454 --> 01:10.789
Yoi.

01:11.557 --> 01:13.157
Ready? Put that one foot forward.

01:13.158 --> 01:15.762
Ready? We'll face this way.
Feet together. Bow!

01:16.861 --> 01:18.962
Grab that bo. Here we
go, nice and strong.

01:18.963 --> 01:20.298
- Step, punch, one!
- Hah!

01:20.299 --> 01:22.766
Up-down! Side-to-side!

01:22.767 --> 01:25.169
Big reverse! And lift it up.

01:25.170 --> 01:26.703
- Big punch! Kiai!
- Hah!

01:26.704 --> 01:28.172
Excellent. Back to steep.

01:28.173 --> 01:30.410
And give these guys
a hand, nice work.

01:35.347 --> 01:37.214
Next belt: black.

01:37.215 --> 01:38.848
Keep training as hard
as you did in blue,

01:38.849 --> 01:41.218
you'll be taking my job some day.

01:41.219 --> 01:43.187
There you go, ready. Feet together.

01:43.188 --> 01:44.688
- Bow.
- Osu.

01:44.689 --> 01:47.091
Let's give Michael a hand,
guys, our newest brown belt.

01:47.092 --> 01:49.529
- Congratulations, buddy.
- I'm so proud of you.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.089
You know...

02:18.090 --> 02:20.059
we did all right with this one.

02:21.426 --> 02:23.295
Yeah, we did.

02:36.874 --> 02:38.609
Open the door.

02:38.610 --> 02:39.943
Open the fuckin' door!

02:39.944 --> 02:42.580
Michael, Michael,
get down, get down!

02:42.581 --> 02:44.761
- Stay here, stay here.
- Open the fuckin' door!

02:46.418 --> 02:48.885
- Open the fuckin' door!
- Open the fuckin' door!

02:48.886 --> 02:50.187
- Hey!
- Phil!

02:50.188 --> 02:51.821
- Okay okay okay.
- Move it!

02:51.822 --> 02:54.025
- Phil, Phil!
- Listen, I'll blow your head off.

02:54.026 --> 02:56.127
Please, don't hurt us, okay?
I have money in my wallet.

02:56.128 --> 02:57.194
Tell this bitch to unlock the door!

02:57.195 --> 02:58.295
- Unlock it!
- Credit cards.

02:58.296 --> 03:00.197
- Open the fucking door.
- No, Carol, no no!

03:00.198 --> 03:02.099
No no, Carol!

03:02.100 --> 03:03.668
- Unlock it right now!
- No!

03:03.669 --> 03:06.337
No no no no!

03:06.338 --> 03:08.575
Phil!

03:11.009 --> 03:13.546
No.

03:19.518 --> 03:21.352
What did you do, man?

03:21.353 --> 03:23.254
What the fuck did you do?

03:23.255 --> 03:25.022
Take her out.

03:25.023 --> 03:27.724
Kill her right now! Take her out!

03:27.725 --> 03:30.105
- Fuck that! I didn't sign up for this.
- Get off me!

03:32.863 --> 03:34.864
- Please don't kill me.
- Don't look at me.

03:34.865 --> 03:36.866
- I don't want to die.
- Don't look at me.

03:36.867 --> 03:41.074
- Please please, I don't want to die.
- Shut the fuck up!

04:29.920 --> 04:31.221
Hold on.

04:32.390 --> 04:33.992
Where the fuck you guys been?

04:54.979 --> 04:58.452
Sorry for party rockin'

05:08.660 --> 05:10.496
Michael!

05:12.430 --> 05:13.531
Go after him.

05:13.532 --> 05:17.171
And models in the VIP...

05:19.571 --> 05:21.038
There he is! There he is!

05:21.039 --> 05:24.344
Out for the whole damn club to see

05:27.078 --> 05:30.080
Sorry for party rockin'

05:30.081 --> 05:33.450
When they talk shit,
we just be like

05:33.451 --> 05:36.754
Sorry for party rockin'

05:36.755 --> 05:40.524
People always say
that my music's loud

05:40.525 --> 05:43.727
Sorry for party rockin'

05:43.728 --> 05:47.464
Neighbors complain,
saying "Turn it down"

05:47.465 --> 05:50.035
Sorry for party...

05:58.610 --> 06:00.311
- Morris.
- Len.

06:00.312 --> 06:02.213
There was a disturbance call.

06:02.214 --> 06:04.381
- House party.
- Hmm.

06:04.382 --> 06:06.585
The ringleader here
gave us some flak.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.521
A couple of the kids say that
the booze came from him.

06:10.522 --> 06:12.356
I don't know what to say.

06:12.357 --> 06:15.496
He's just lucky he didn't get picked
up by one of the other patrols.

06:23.101 --> 06:25.469
Morris, I'm doing all I can here.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.438
I know it hasn't been easy for him,

06:27.439 --> 06:30.377
but I can't keep getting
him off the hook.

06:34.713 --> 06:36.647
He gets picked up again,

06:36.648 --> 06:39.149
he's gonna have to go
through the system.

06:39.150 --> 06:41.285
You've done more than enough, Len,

06:41.286 --> 06:42.887
and I appreciate it.

06:42.888 --> 06:44.958
You have yourself a good night.

06:59.204 --> 07:02.610
Can't you see my
heart is breaking...

07:28.900 --> 07:30.901
I don't even know why I
show up to school, man.

07:30.902 --> 07:34.705
- It's a waste of my time.
- Guess who got some after the party.

07:34.706 --> 07:37.441
Dude, jerking off a cop to let
you go doesn't count, man.

07:37.442 --> 07:38.710
Yeah yeah.

07:39.844 --> 07:41.879
Remember that chick?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.080
- No way.
- Way, dude.

07:43.081 --> 07:44.415
She got separated from her friends

07:44.416 --> 07:46.583
- and she needed a ride home.
- You don't even have a car.

07:46.584 --> 07:48.919
I know. We wandered around
forever trying to find it.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.055
- Dude, smell my fingers.
- Aw, you're sick, man.

07:51.056 --> 07:52.989
Dude, a brother's gotta eat, right?

07:52.990 --> 07:55.025
Michael Shaw, please
come to the office.

07:55.026 --> 07:56.327
- Oh.
- Shit.

07:56.328 --> 07:58.062
Again?

07:58.063 --> 07:59.663
Man, I'm sorry. Yeah, I gotta go.

07:59.664 --> 08:02.068
Let's go, guys.

08:03.468 --> 08:06.205
Whoo, oh, that's nice.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.174
Oh ho, sorry, dude.

08:10.175 --> 08:11.677
Nice hat.

08:14.179 --> 08:17.050
Principal Vanhorne is
ready to see you now.

08:21.653 --> 08:23.520
Ah, Mr. Shaw.

08:23.521 --> 08:25.558
Join us please.

08:33.765 --> 08:35.866
I can understand your frustration.

08:35.866 --> 08:38.602
I mean, it must be very difficult
having all your friends

08:38.602 --> 08:40.804
in college and you're still here.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.306
But that falls on you.

08:42.307 --> 08:44.742
Your grandfather and
I are very concerned

08:44.743 --> 08:46.877
about your extracurricular
activities.

08:46.878 --> 08:49.446
- Well, you don't need to be.
- Really?

08:49.447 --> 08:52.284
- Yeah.
- What'd you do this weekend?

08:58.857 --> 09:02.062
Go go go go!

09:10.135 --> 09:13.404
According to this you're
barely passing, Michael,

09:13.405 --> 09:16.777
and you haven't even started
your community service hours.

09:18.743 --> 09:21.782
You can't take a third
victory lap, son.

09:23.548 --> 09:26.083
Your grandfather and I
have a possible solution.

09:26.084 --> 09:28.952
Your father's old friend
Reggie runs that doji...

09:28.953 --> 09:31.321
- Dojo.
- He's agreed to let you

09:31.322 --> 09:33.490
do your community
service hours there.

09:33.491 --> 09:35.726
You'll go there every day after
school starting tomorrow.

09:35.727 --> 09:37.761
Keep up a passing grade average

09:37.762 --> 09:40.497
and you could walk out of
here having earned a diploma.

09:40.498 --> 09:43.336
You have an opportunity
here, Michael.

09:44.869 --> 09:47.304
And we are willing to help you.

09:47.305 --> 09:50.544
But only if you're willing
to help yourself.

11:34.146 --> 11:36.483
No shoes on the floor.

11:38.883 --> 11:40.450
Michael, right?

11:40.451 --> 11:42.686
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:42.687 --> 11:44.523
You look like him.

11:45.256 --> 11:47.426
This is the main dojo floor.

11:48.726 --> 11:50.694
The only time you'll be on it

11:50.695 --> 11:53.065
is when you're cleaning it.

11:54.066 --> 11:55.566
The mirrors

11:55.567 --> 11:58.204
need to be wiped down every night.

11:59.071 --> 12:01.338
You're not a narcissist, are ya?

12:01.339 --> 12:03.307
No.

12:03.308 --> 12:05.342
And right here,

12:05.343 --> 12:07.511
that's the master.

12:07.512 --> 12:10.183
He looks over the place.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.789
Your arsenal.

12:20.458 --> 12:23.563
What'd you expect, wax on, wax off?

12:31.836 --> 12:34.805
The kids have a hard
time hitting the bowl,

12:34.806 --> 12:38.446
so you'll probably spend
a lot of time in here.

12:43.182 --> 12:46.150
- Hey, where're you going?
- Home.

12:46.151 --> 12:48.585
So I'm your janitor.

12:48.586 --> 12:50.554
Look, kid,

12:50.555 --> 12:52.656
I'm doing you a favor.

12:52.657 --> 12:55.529
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.667
You might need those to lock up.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.201
You actually trust me?

13:03.202 --> 13:05.939
What's there to steal, the mirrors?

13:07.338 --> 13:09.207
He's watching.

13:34.199 --> 13:35.834
This is bullshit.

14:36.427 --> 14:38.229
Whew!

15:00.718 --> 15:02.053
Tough guy, are you?

15:02.054 --> 15:03.420
Come here.

15:03.421 --> 15:04.789
He really isn't our chi...

15:17.369 --> 15:20.808
- So how was it?
- Great.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.147
Now there was a time

15:31.016 --> 15:33.486
When you loved me so

15:35.787 --> 15:38.459
I couldn't do wrong

15:39.457 --> 15:42.329
Now you need to know

15:44.229 --> 15:48.532
See, I've been a bad
bad bad bad man

15:48.533 --> 15:51.170
And I'm in deep

15:51.969 --> 15:53.404
Yeah

15:53.405 --> 15:56.706
And I found a brand-new
love for this man...

15:56.707 --> 15:59.609
- Oh.
- And can't wait till you see

15:59.610 --> 16:01.713
How you like me now?

16:02.480 --> 16:03.982
How you like me now?

16:04.715 --> 16:06.350
How you like me now?

16:06.351 --> 16:07.684
How you like me now?

16:07.685 --> 16:09.187
I know.

16:09.188 --> 16:11.255
How you like me now?

16:11.256 --> 16:12.923
How you like me now?

16:12.924 --> 16:15.194
Remember the time

16:16.794 --> 16:19.432
When I eat you up?

16:21.732 --> 16:24.768
Yeah, I was a line

16:24.769 --> 16:28.139
- That you can't give up...
- Oh man.

16:28.140 --> 16:32.343
I've asked you all to
reread pages 62 to 65

16:32.344 --> 16:34.479
because your test
scores were very low.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.014
So we are going to
review this information.

16:37.015 --> 16:39.452
Come on, people. It's on the board.

16:40.952 --> 16:43.155
Come on, people, it's on the board.

16:44.089 --> 16:45.522
Michael?

16:45.523 --> 16:47.824
- H-C-N?
- Yes.

16:47.825 --> 16:49.761
So how you like me now?

16:50.496 --> 16:52.396
How you like me now?

16:52.397 --> 16:55.099
How you like me now?

16:55.100 --> 16:56.502
How you like me now?

17:01.572 --> 17:05.476
Does that make you love me, baby?

17:05.477 --> 17:09.250
Does that make you want me, baby?

17:14.353 --> 17:17.288
Oh mercy

17:17.289 --> 17:19.955
Yeah

17:19.957 --> 17:21.825
Oh yeah

17:21.826 --> 17:25.398
Oh yes, I said

17:26.531 --> 17:29.799
Oh yeah, hey

17:29.800 --> 17:33.104
Oooh yeah

17:33.105 --> 17:36.377
Oh yeah, oh

17:37.742 --> 17:39.609
Oh yeah

17:39.610 --> 17:42.013
Oh so

17:42.014 --> 17:44.718
All right.

17:54.592 --> 17:58.029
Higher. Attagirl.

17:58.030 --> 18:00.367
Calf... that's great.

18:03.368 --> 18:04.770
Higher.

18:05.504 --> 18:07.541
Attagirl.

18:24.456 --> 18:26.623
Hai! Hai!

18:26.624 --> 18:28.259
Hai!

18:29.827 --> 18:31.795
Hey.

18:31.796 --> 18:34.398
Make sure when you punch you
gotta take it out, okay?

18:34.399 --> 18:36.334
- Okay.
- Up here, you don't wanna get it caught

18:36.335 --> 18:38.102
'cause otherwise
you're gonna break it.

18:38.103 --> 18:40.237
- You don't wanna break it, right?
- No.

18:40.238 --> 18:42.508
Let's try it.

18:47.446 --> 18:49.148
Here, hit it.

18:51.983 --> 18:54.884
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

18:54.885 --> 18:56.554
- Good.
- Nice to see you.

18:56.555 --> 18:58.055
How is school going?

18:58.056 --> 19:00.191
I know.

19:00.192 --> 19:01.727
Good job.

19:09.767 --> 19:11.901
- Bye Bye.
- Hey, thank you.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.970
- Bye. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sensei.

19:13.971 --> 19:15.705
- Bye.
- Jimmy!

19:15.706 --> 19:17.642
Bye.

19:17.643 --> 19:19.377
See you tomorrow.

19:19.378 --> 19:21.445
Bye. Bye. Thank you.

19:21.446 --> 19:22.814
Bye.

19:24.082 --> 19:26.251
You work well with kids.

19:27.252 --> 19:30.089
Looks like you remember
a thing or two.

19:31.256 --> 19:32.789
That was a long time ago.

19:32.790 --> 19:34.924
I'll tell you what,
you divide your time

19:34.925 --> 19:36.926
between keeping this place spotless

19:36.927 --> 19:38.329
and helping me with the kids,

19:38.330 --> 19:40.598
and let's see if we can
get you back into a gi.

19:40.599 --> 19:43.668
Look, I'm just here to
finish my hours, okay?

19:43.669 --> 19:46.206
Yeah, I can see that.

19:47.506 --> 19:49.939
Look, this isn't...
it's not me anymore.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.575
Well, when it is you,

19:51.576 --> 19:53.713
I'll see you on the floor.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.416
Oh, and don't even
think about it...

19:58.283 --> 20:00.052
she's my niece.

20:37.922 --> 20:40.159
Hyah... ya!

21:09.488 --> 21:10.756
Get changed.

21:16.762 --> 21:18.799
Gotta earn it.

21:34.780 --> 21:36.450
You look good. How does it feel?

21:37.415 --> 21:38.449
It feels pretty good.

21:38.450 --> 21:40.553
Let's see your front stance.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.459
Needs a little work.

21:48.460 --> 21:50.363
Again.

21:54.699 --> 21:56.066
Better.

21:56.067 --> 21:58.435
All right. Shoulders back,

21:58.436 --> 22:01.842
chest out, chin up.

22:04.643 --> 22:06.880
Okay, let's see a front punch.

22:09.447 --> 22:11.915
Okay, this... chamber hand?

22:11.916 --> 22:13.917
Always even with the belt.

22:13.918 --> 22:15.988
All right? Again.

22:18.856 --> 22:20.359
Good. Breathe.

22:21.693 --> 22:22.926
You're not breathing.

22:22.927 --> 22:24.528
Breathe. Go!

22:24.529 --> 22:25.797
Louder.

22:26.665 --> 22:28.699
From your gut. Never
mind how it sounds.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.668
It's gonna protect
you, all right? Again.

22:30.669 --> 22:33.070
- Hyah!
- There you go. Again.

22:33.071 --> 22:34.772
Hyah!

22:34.773 --> 22:36.843
Good. Keep working on it.

23:21.686 --> 23:23.554
Ha-aaa.

23:23.555 --> 23:25.725
Not bad.

23:28.426 --> 23:30.160
I didn't think anybody
was watching.

23:30.161 --> 23:32.932
You can just pretend I'm not.

23:33.665 --> 23:35.000
You'll get in trouble.

23:38.270 --> 23:39.703
I'm Jen.

23:39.704 --> 23:41.705
Michael.

23:41.706 --> 23:43.973
- You're Reggie's niece, right?
- Uh, yeah.

23:43.974 --> 23:47.044
- Is he around?
- Nah, he just took off.

23:47.045 --> 23:49.415
Thanks.

23:50.948 --> 23:52.917
Is there something I
can help you with?

23:52.918 --> 23:55.255
I don't think so.

23:56.221 --> 23:58.591
Wait, you came all the
way here for nothing?

24:00.091 --> 24:02.026
How do you know I don't
live across the street?

24:02.027 --> 24:04.994
- A girl like you?
- Oh, smooth.

24:04.995 --> 24:06.531
Does that normally work?

24:08.466 --> 24:10.967
So is this what you're
gonna be doing all night?

24:10.968 --> 24:13.970
You mean standing in front of a
mirror making an ass out of myself?

24:13.971 --> 24:16.307
Yeah, pretty much.

24:16.308 --> 24:18.442
Get changed.

24:18.443 --> 24:20.780
I wanna show you something.

24:39.297 --> 24:42.399
Do me a favor? Don't tell my
uncle I brought you here.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.201
He's old school.

24:44.202 --> 24:45.803
Okay.

24:45.804 --> 24:48.005
Buckle up, get strapped in

24:48.006 --> 24:49.840
We're getting wild in Moscow now

24:49.841 --> 24:52.476
We'll keep it cool like
Aspen, trans-Siberian

24:52.477 --> 24:53.811
- And off the tracks...
- Hey.

24:53.812 --> 24:54.979
- How's it going?
- Good.

24:54.980 --> 24:57.050
Hi sweetie.

24:58.516 --> 25:01.218
- Ladies, this is Michael.
- Hey, Michael, how's it going?

25:01.219 --> 25:03.021
He's a janitor.

25:04.089 --> 25:05.689
Come on.

25:05.690 --> 25:07.291
Okay, let's go.

25:07.292 --> 25:09.660
Everybody get your hands
in the Soviet dance

25:09.661 --> 25:11.228
Now drop, keep it moving, man...

25:11.229 --> 25:13.499
We've been doin' this
for three hours.

25:14.232 --> 25:16.200
What time are we gonna get in?

25:16.201 --> 25:18.972
- The fights are gonna be over.
- Come on, man.

25:20.772 --> 25:22.608
Come on.

25:25.477 --> 25:27.045
Jesus.

25:28.847 --> 25:30.581
What is this place?

25:30.582 --> 25:32.216
You'll see.

25:32.217 --> 25:34.852
Who's that guy? Come on.

25:34.853 --> 25:36.653
- You'll get your turn.
- That was our turn.

25:36.654 --> 25:38.434
We're freezing our
asses off out here.

25:40.258 --> 25:42.695
- We'll meet you guys inside.
- Okay.

25:44.863 --> 25:46.866
I guess we're taking two.

26:00.612 --> 26:02.780
- Fighting?
- Yeah. It's awesome, right?

26:02.781 --> 26:04.848
Might drop like blocks in Tetris

26:04.849 --> 26:07.184
Man, I'm purple in the eye
'cause we're rockin' it

26:07.185 --> 26:09.820
Sing it, sunrise in the a.m....

26:09.821 --> 26:11.223
Hey!

26:13.358 --> 26:14.525
- Hey, thanks.
- No worries.

26:14.526 --> 26:17.096
Oh my God, who's winning so far?

26:19.764 --> 26:21.467
This is insane.

26:27.073 --> 26:28.808
Hang on, tighten it!

26:29.974 --> 26:31.844
Don't lose him now. Tighten!

26:39.250 --> 26:40.919
Whoo!

26:47.826 --> 26:50.327
Yo, how crazy was
that fight, y'all?

26:50.328 --> 26:51.830
What's up?

26:56.102 --> 26:58.936
All right, y'all. All right, yo!

26:58.937 --> 27:00.604
All right, check this out.

27:00.605 --> 27:02.873
Yo, this next match

27:02.874 --> 27:04.541
is balls to the walls.

27:04.542 --> 27:06.376
No holds barred.

27:06.377 --> 27:10.948
This... yo, this is what
you are all here for.

27:10.949 --> 27:12.816
- What?
- He's crazy.

27:12.817 --> 27:14.418
First we got

27:14.419 --> 27:18.155
Nick Maynar-rrrrd!

27:18.156 --> 27:21.060
- Go home, go home!
- Whoo!

27:22.627 --> 27:23.660
This guy's huge.

27:23.661 --> 27:25.796
And his opponent

27:25.797 --> 27:27.397
Dominic

27:27.398 --> 27:30.770
Motherfuckin' Gray-yyy!

27:32.303 --> 27:33.905
Yeah!

27:36.075 --> 27:39.012
He is the sickest fighter.
Oh my God.

27:40.645 --> 27:42.715
Go to your corner.

27:47.119 --> 27:49.753
Stop it, no! Stop it, no!

27:49.754 --> 27:51.989
Stop... no no no! No no no!

27:51.990 --> 27:53.893
No-ooo!

27:55.127 --> 27:57.998
Now I know you're ready.
Let's do this, baby.

28:13.678 --> 28:15.246
Hey, what's up?

28:27.292 --> 28:29.027
Are you okay?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.969
Michael?

28:45.010 --> 28:46.712
- Come on!
- Get off him.

28:48.246 --> 28:52.583
- Oh shit, Dom-ination, baby!
- Whoo!

28:52.584 --> 28:56.491
Dominic Gray, a bad bad man.

29:07.498 --> 29:10.434
Hey. Ahem, I wanna report a crime.

29:10.435 --> 29:13.270
I mean, I have some
information about a crime.

29:13.271 --> 29:15.606
Okay, sir. Can you tell
me exactly what happened?

29:15.607 --> 29:19.077
It was a... it was a carjacking,
but there was a murder involved.

29:19.078 --> 29:22.379
- And where was this?
- Well, it was a long time ago.

29:22.380 --> 29:25.549
- I don't really remember.
- Why are you only coming forward now?

29:25.550 --> 29:27.151
No no, because...

29:27.152 --> 29:29.419
because I got new
information, okay?

29:29.420 --> 29:32.425
Do you... do you have a
case number or a reference?

29:33.358 --> 29:35.795
The victims were my parents.

29:36.661 --> 29:39.599
It was a carjacking and...

29:40.565 --> 29:42.699
I saw the guy tonight! Okay?

29:42.700 --> 29:45.736
I need one of you guys to go down there
and arrest this guy right fucking now!

29:45.737 --> 29:48.305
As you know, we can't just go
out there and arrest him, okay?

29:48.306 --> 29:51.109
We need a warrant for that. Now if
you'd just calm down for a minute

29:51.110 --> 29:54.148
and properly explain
the situa... sir? Sir?

30:09.427 --> 30:12.332
You, uh, forgetting something?

30:15.933 --> 30:20.240
When you step into this dojo you
leave everything else outside.

30:22.274 --> 30:24.574
The only thing you bring in
here is your concentration.

30:24.575 --> 30:27.780
- Where are you right now?
- Leaving.

30:33.018 --> 30:35.555
40, 60, 80, 100.

30:36.788 --> 30:38.789
Oh man, I'm losing count, man.

30:38.790 --> 30:40.857
I need a bigger drawer, Big D.

30:40.858 --> 30:44.498
Woo! Man, we made a
killing last night, yo.

30:45.930 --> 30:47.497
Hey, boss.

30:47.498 --> 30:49.568
It's all right, man.

30:58.876 --> 31:00.510
Is there somethin'
I can do for you?

31:00.511 --> 31:01.946
I wanna fight.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.748
And you are...?

31:04.749 --> 31:06.284
Michael Shaw.

31:06.285 --> 31:08.353
And I care why?

31:08.354 --> 31:10.724
'Cause I have an interest
in one of your fighters.

31:12.523 --> 31:14.593
Look, a fan.

31:17.296 --> 31:18.528
Oh...

31:18.529 --> 31:20.999
I don't have time for this, man.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.303
Hey! Hey, man, I'm serious.

31:25.304 --> 31:27.774
- I wanna fight.
- It's cool, man.

31:29.375 --> 31:32.176
Okay, Michael Shaw,
let's start with this.

31:32.177 --> 31:34.914
Where do you train?
What's your record?

31:36.714 --> 31:38.615
That's what I thought.

31:38.616 --> 31:41.352
Man, I'll fight anybody, okay?

31:41.353 --> 31:42.953
Listen, pretty boy,

31:42.954 --> 31:44.821
I'm pretty sure you got
all kind of reasons

31:44.822 --> 31:46.523
why you wanna become
a fighter, man.

31:46.524 --> 31:49.693
But if I let every kid who walked up
in that office a shot in the cage?

31:49.694 --> 31:53.264
Man, I'd be on a street corner somewhere
begging for change from people like you.

31:53.265 --> 31:55.966
- And I know you ain't got none.
- Yeah, but you don't understand...

31:55.967 --> 31:58.136
Look, kid! It's brave of you,

31:58.137 --> 32:00.707
but the answer is simply no.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.374
I'll tell you what though,

32:03.375 --> 32:05.976
since you did take the trouble of
coming all the way down here, man,

32:05.977 --> 32:08.545
here's two tickets
to tonight's fight.

32:08.546 --> 32:10.281
It's gonna be a good one.

32:10.282 --> 32:12.716
Bring one of your
girlfriends or something.

32:12.717 --> 32:14.285
Okay.

32:29.134 --> 32:30.836
Hell yeah, man.

32:31.969 --> 32:34.138
He really knows how to
put on a fucking show.

32:34.139 --> 32:36.773
He really knows how to
put on a fucking show.

32:36.774 --> 32:40.710
Man, great fights, great eye candy.

32:40.711 --> 32:43.047
You just gotta understand.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.249
- I'm sorry, boys, let's go.
- See you at my place.

32:45.250 --> 32:47.019
Follow us. Absolutely. Let's go.

34:01.826 --> 34:04.230
Let's go inside.

34:15.973 --> 34:17.674
It's my jam!

34:17.675 --> 34:19.842
Motherfuck's my jam, man!

34:19.844 --> 34:22.513
All right, three. It's Jaeger.

34:22.514 --> 34:24.583
Everybody, everybody,

36:26.038 --> 36:28.207
Yo!

36:30.308 --> 36:32.009
What are you doing?

36:32.010 --> 36:34.279
You snooping around
here or somethin'?

36:37.149 --> 36:40.454
I asked you a question, kid.

36:42.154 --> 36:45.225
Yo, get Dom out here.

37:10.348 --> 37:12.551
The kid was snooping
around out back.

37:14.852 --> 37:16.755
Look at me, kid.

37:19.124 --> 37:21.528
You know you're trespassing, right?

37:25.731 --> 37:27.868
Do you know what that means?

37:30.502 --> 37:31.937
Do you?

37:46.184 --> 37:48.220
Do you wanna know something funny?

37:52.257 --> 37:55.459
I can cut your eye out right here,

37:55.460 --> 37:57.661
right now

37:57.662 --> 38:00.867
and nobody would think twice.

38:04.770 --> 38:06.936
I can kill you

38:06.937 --> 38:08.472
and nobody would care.

38:08.473 --> 38:11.110
Remember that.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.550
And get the fuck off my property.

38:23.488 --> 38:25.358
Stupid-ass kid.

38:35.066 --> 38:36.601
Hey, keep it moving.

38:39.237 --> 38:40.837
Here.

38:40.838 --> 38:43.808
This is the address of the man
that I saw kill my parents.

38:43.809 --> 38:45.276
And there's my number.

38:45.277 --> 38:48.749
Give me a call when somebody decides
to do their job around here.

38:50.248 --> 38:51.549
Michael!

38:52.784 --> 38:54.152
Hey!

38:58.056 --> 38:59.123
What did he want?

38:59.124 --> 39:00.924
Uh, it's his second time in here.

39:00.925 --> 39:02.560
The kid's all over the place.

39:02.561 --> 39:05.763
Wants us to go pick up some guy on
a seven-year-old murder charge.

39:05.764 --> 39:07.901
Here, he gave me this.

39:20.478 --> 39:21.911
Hey.

39:21.912 --> 39:24.448
Look, I know I lost
my cool the other day

39:24.449 --> 39:26.886
and I shouldn't have.

39:27.686 --> 39:29.823
This place means a lot to me.

39:31.289 --> 39:33.157
I want to help you.

39:33.158 --> 39:35.027
I wanna help the kids.

39:35.993 --> 39:38.028
And I want to keep on
training, you know,

39:38.029 --> 39:41.267
- provided that's okay with you.
- Okay.

39:44.236 --> 39:45.604
That's it?

39:48.139 --> 39:50.241
Look, I said I'm sorry.

39:51.810 --> 39:53.777
I thought this place was
supposed to be about

39:53.778 --> 39:56.148
honor and respect.

39:58.016 --> 40:00.384
- Hit this.
- What?

40:00.385 --> 40:02.555
Hit this.

40:08.593 --> 40:10.828
Deep breath,

40:10.829 --> 40:12.563
focus

40:12.564 --> 40:14.066
and strike.

40:25.710 --> 40:27.646
Hai!

40:29.447 --> 40:33.120
The makiwara defines
the essence of karate.

40:33.852 --> 40:36.053
Your punch can bounce off

40:36.054 --> 40:38.756
just as easily as it can puncture.

40:38.757 --> 40:43.227
The only thing that
factors into it is you...

40:43.228 --> 40:44.862
your mind,

40:44.863 --> 40:46.330
your focus

40:46.331 --> 40:47.598
and your form.

40:47.599 --> 40:49.800
You wanna get angry,

40:49.801 --> 40:53.106
you wanna hit something, hit this.

40:54.439 --> 40:56.507
4:00 every day,

40:56.508 --> 40:58.742
same as before.

40:58.743 --> 41:00.679
Keep at it.

41:43.989 --> 41:46.090
Osu, stand, yoi.

41:46.091 --> 41:48.227
All right, jumping
jacks, 10 fast... go!

41:51.663 --> 41:54.064
Other hand here, punching.

41:54.065 --> 41:56.400
Here we go, ready? And...

41:56.401 --> 41:59.536
watch out, guys. One, two...

41:59.537 --> 42:01.805
as fast as you can. Five...

42:01.806 --> 42:03.174
six...

42:09.581 --> 42:12.085
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi.

42:12.851 --> 42:14.184
Oh, how you doing?

42:14.185 --> 42:15.386
- Good.
- Good.

42:15.387 --> 42:17.624
Come on in.

42:22.293 --> 42:24.262
Here we go!

42:39.310 --> 42:40.912
Don't, no no no no no!

43:00.198 --> 43:03.068
One, two, three, karate!

43:03.069 --> 43:04.701
Good job last night. Good job.

43:04.702 --> 43:06.004
- What's that there? Oh!
- What?

43:06.005 --> 43:07.805
Good job.

43:07.806 --> 43:09.509
Good job.

43:36.501 --> 43:39.473
And it's on!

43:58.690 --> 43:59.991
Oooh.

44:41.499 --> 44:44.035
Ladies and gentlemen, get
ready for another crazy one.

44:44.036 --> 44:47.337
Right about now we got my
man Bullet inside the cage.

44:47.338 --> 44:49.107
My dude is quick, but yo!

44:49.108 --> 44:51.308
His opponent, the undefeated

44:51.309 --> 44:54.146
Dominic Gray-yyy!

45:00.318 --> 45:01.785
- Go to your corner.
- Whoo!

45:01.786 --> 45:04.055
Yo, I know my man got
some speed on him,

45:04.056 --> 45:07.524
but I'm telling you, I don't know how
he's gonna get himself outta this one.

45:07.525 --> 45:09.426
I hope he can respond.

45:09.427 --> 45:13.230
Dominic Gray is a
bad bad man, y'all.

45:13.231 --> 45:15.532
You all know how he does it.

45:15.533 --> 45:17.970
Y'all ready for this one or what?

45:19.171 --> 45:21.105
- You ready?
- Excuse me.

45:21.106 --> 45:22.606
All right, let's do this.

45:22.607 --> 45:25.809
This gonna be crazy 'cause
you know it always is!

45:25.810 --> 45:28.645
Get ready to fight, baby!

45:28.646 --> 45:30.914
- Let's go!
- Come on!

45:30.915 --> 45:32.749
Here we go!

45:32.750 --> 45:35.922
- Whoo, middle of the war, y'all!
- Whoo!

46:05.950 --> 46:08.922
- Off him.
- Come on, come on, come on.

46:10.189 --> 46:13.757
Dominic Gray, people, 13 and 0.

46:13.758 --> 46:17.995
It's for this reason and
out of popular demand,

46:17.996 --> 46:21.065
that your kind promoter
and our sponsors

46:21.066 --> 46:25.236
have decided to host a
tournament starting May 15th.

46:25.237 --> 46:28.206
We want the best fighters
inside this cage.

46:28.207 --> 46:31.679
No weight class. And
the awarded prize?

46:32.410 --> 46:35.549
$50,000 cash!

46:37.315 --> 46:40.484
Oh shit. Hey, and to get it?

46:40.485 --> 46:42.986
Fight your way through
to this motherfucker

46:42.987 --> 46:44.723
and try knockin' him out!

46:48.227 --> 46:50.161
Dominic Gray, y'all!

46:50.162 --> 46:51.530
Undefeated!

47:09.315 --> 47:11.515
Yeah, man, I was just
tellin' Big D, man,

47:11.516 --> 47:13.417
this is gonna be our
wildest one yet, man.

47:13.418 --> 47:15.419
Oh, it's gonna be crazy.
Dom can't wait.

47:15.420 --> 47:17.255
He's just ready to kill
motherfuckers, man.

47:17.256 --> 47:19.456
You should've seen him
tonight, man... 10 seconds.

47:19.457 --> 47:21.225
I don't even think it
was 10 seconds, man.

47:21.226 --> 47:23.994
Yo, it's gonna be off the hook,
man. It's the best tournament...

47:23.995 --> 47:26.030
I'll call you back, man.
I gotta call you back.

47:26.031 --> 47:27.998
It's all right. Cool,
man, it's cool.

47:27.999 --> 47:29.835
I gotta call you back.

47:30.568 --> 47:32.636
Jesus Christ, man, you again?

47:32.637 --> 47:35.439
- Didn't I comp you already?
- I wanna fight in the tournament.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.574
Yeah, let me guess:

47:37.575 --> 47:39.743
You hear five sexy numbers
and all of a sudden

47:39.744 --> 47:42.646
you're seeing a nice little hatchback
and affordable girlfriend, right?

47:42.647 --> 47:44.282
It's not about the money.

47:44.283 --> 47:46.017
I just wanna fight.

47:46.018 --> 47:48.353
Look, I appreciate your
dedication here, man,

47:48.354 --> 47:50.754
but the shit's wearing thin.
It's not cute no more, man.

47:50.755 --> 47:53.415
- Now get outta my office.
- I don't think you're listening.

47:54.692 --> 47:56.695
Apparently neither are you.

48:02.834 --> 48:04.537
Oh shit!

48:06.038 --> 48:07.671
All right. Ha ha!

48:07.672 --> 48:10.640
Cool. But I can't throw you
in just like that, man.

48:10.641 --> 48:13.410
You need some crowd time
and at least one win.

48:13.411 --> 48:14.946
You gotta be likeable.

48:18.083 --> 48:21.585
Ahem. Okay, I got one fighter
who just backed out last minute

48:21.586 --> 48:24.488
at one of the other circuits.
Street match... amateur hour.

48:24.489 --> 48:26.923
Fine. When is it?

48:26.924 --> 48:29.395
Tomorrow night.

48:36.534 --> 48:39.071
Don't make me regret this, kid.

48:44.042 --> 48:45.510
Huh.

48:47.879 --> 48:49.415
Get your ass up, man.

49:14.505 --> 49:16.140
Hey.

49:16.974 --> 49:18.610
Hey.

49:23.481 --> 49:24.883
I...

49:25.683 --> 49:27.820
Thanks for meeting up.

49:29.787 --> 49:31.824
I was kind of a dick before.

49:33.325 --> 49:35.895
I figured, um...

49:37.728 --> 49:39.863
maybe I was too forward

49:39.864 --> 49:40.964
and scared you off.

49:40.965 --> 49:43.134
No. No, not at all.

49:43.135 --> 49:44.268
Really?

49:44.269 --> 49:46.370
Yeah, it's...

49:46.371 --> 49:47.804
it's refreshing.

49:47.805 --> 49:50.343
Mm, interesting.

49:51.976 --> 49:53.512
So...

49:54.446 --> 49:56.180
You're a part-time janitor,

49:56.181 --> 50:00.218
a part-time karate
instructor and full-time...?

50:00.219 --> 50:01.486
I'm a student.

50:01.487 --> 50:03.690
Mmm. What school do you go to?

50:04.522 --> 50:06.523
Crescent Valley.

50:06.524 --> 50:08.627
Isn't that a...

50:09.560 --> 50:11.395
Yeah.

50:11.396 --> 50:14.365
- You're not, like, 15, are you?
- No.

50:14.366 --> 50:16.000
Oh, right on.

50:16.001 --> 50:18.535
So you're just a perfectionist
with your grades.

50:18.536 --> 50:21.172
So are you ever going to move
out of your parents' basement

50:21.173 --> 50:23.974
or are you gonna be that guy
that stays there till he's 30?

50:23.975 --> 50:27.844
Uh, my parents died
when I was 12, so I...

50:27.845 --> 50:30.314
I live with my grandfather.

50:30.315 --> 50:32.383
Shit, I'm...

50:32.384 --> 50:33.850
I'm sorry.

50:33.851 --> 50:36.320
So looks like you got
me all figured out.

50:36.321 --> 50:38.324
How about you?

50:39.091 --> 50:41.591
I grew up out west.

50:41.592 --> 50:45.096
Um, I came here a few years
ago just to visit my uncle

50:45.097 --> 50:47.198
and kind of fell in
love with the city.

50:47.199 --> 50:49.866
So I took a year off
after high school

50:49.867 --> 50:54.838
and applied for some programs
here in criminology.

50:54.839 --> 50:57.508
And soon as I got in I was
on the first plane out.

50:57.509 --> 50:59.643
So you're looking to
catch the bad guys, huh?

50:59.644 --> 51:02.446
Oh well, you know, I do
live in the student ghetto

51:02.447 --> 51:06.183
so I am looking to catch the perp
who stole my bike in freshman year

51:06.184 --> 51:09.520
and subjecting him to the full power
of the criminal justice system.

51:09.521 --> 51:12.089
Your parents must be proud.

51:12.090 --> 51:14.925
Mm, yeah. Reg is even prouder.

51:14.926 --> 51:18.129
You know, he can be
pretty over-protective,

51:18.130 --> 51:21.265
so I think he likes the fact that
I'll be able to stand up for myself.

51:21.266 --> 51:23.336
Nice.

51:25.170 --> 51:26.736
So I got this thing tonight.

51:26.737 --> 51:28.239
I've got a fight.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.473
You?

51:29.474 --> 51:31.175
Yeah.

51:31.176 --> 51:34.245
- Like a fight fight?
- Yeah, like a fight fight.

51:34.246 --> 51:36.947
Oh, I didn't even know you
were into that kind of thing.

51:36.948 --> 51:39.319
Is there a lot of money on it?

51:40.085 --> 51:41.685
It's not really about the money.

51:41.686 --> 51:43.620
Does my uncle know?

51:43.621 --> 51:46.524
I keep your secret, you keep mine?

51:46.525 --> 51:49.966
Okay.

51:52.064 --> 51:53.763
Reggie's Karate.

51:53.764 --> 51:55.799
Leave a message.

51:55.800 --> 51:59.537
Hey, Reg, it's... it's Michael.

51:59.538 --> 52:02.939
Uh, I'm not gonna be able
to make it in today, man.

52:02.940 --> 52:06.377
I'm... I think I'm coming
down with something.

52:06.378 --> 52:07.913
I'll see you Monday.

52:08.879 --> 52:10.482
Sorry.

52:31.470 --> 52:33.703
Go ahead.

52:33.704 --> 52:37.074
Every Friday night just like that.

52:37.075 --> 52:38.742
Oh, he gets...

52:38.743 --> 52:40.077
Oh!

52:40.078 --> 52:41.580
Come on, man.

53:11.776 --> 53:13.312
Come on, man!

53:15.846 --> 53:17.381
Gotta keep your eyes open, brother.

53:17.382 --> 53:18.915
He's too fast for you.

53:18.916 --> 53:21.718
Oh, bitch, you just
got head-butted.

53:21.719 --> 53:24.288
- Oh oh, and another one.
- Kid!

53:24.289 --> 53:26.157
Yo, come on, man, you're next.

53:26.158 --> 53:29.826
- You can do better than that.
- What the hell is this for?

53:29.827 --> 53:32.563
Dawg, the only thing you're
gonna need are your fists

53:32.564 --> 53:35.366
- and a heavy sack...
- Get up, come on!

53:35.367 --> 53:38.035
It's over, it is over!

53:38.036 --> 53:39.905
and a fucking prayer.

53:42.441 --> 53:44.945
All right, all right, bring it in.

53:45.677 --> 53:47.447
Give it up, give it up!

53:50.415 --> 53:53.787
Squaring off against Jimmy D-DDD!

53:56.221 --> 53:58.089
Come on, give it up!

53:58.090 --> 53:59.625
Ha ha!

54:00.358 --> 54:01.893
Michael Shaw.

54:09.834 --> 54:11.535
All right, check it, check it.

54:11.536 --> 54:14.405
No biting, no groin
shots, no eye gouges.

54:14.406 --> 54:16.741
You can't get up, you lose.

54:16.742 --> 54:18.743
You tap, you lose.

54:18.744 --> 54:20.077
You ready?

54:20.078 --> 54:22.348
Ready?

54:23.448 --> 54:24.816
Let's do this.

54:34.126 --> 54:36.293
Yeah, Jimmy, knock
this kid the fuck out.

54:36.294 --> 54:39.029
I got shit to do. Oh!

54:39.030 --> 54:41.532
Send this kid home, man!

54:41.533 --> 54:44.635
Ha ha! Oh...

54:44.636 --> 54:46.472
Sorry, Mike!

54:50.208 --> 54:52.042
Oh, don't kill him, Jimmy.

54:52.043 --> 54:54.547
Stay down, man.

54:59.484 --> 55:01.085
Oh oh...

55:01.086 --> 55:02.720
Oh!

55:02.721 --> 55:04.324
The boy got some moves.

55:05.157 --> 55:06.492
Come on, Jimmy.

55:26.044 --> 55:28.180
Oooh.

55:29.181 --> 55:31.215
Give it up for the kid,

55:31.216 --> 55:32.449
Michael Shaw!

55:32.450 --> 55:33.917
Yo yo!

55:33.918 --> 55:36.853
That was fucking incredible, kid!

55:36.854 --> 55:40.928
- So am I in or not?
- Yeah, you're in. You got six weeks.

55:48.433 --> 55:49.701
Whew!

56:08.653 --> 56:10.055
Hello.

56:10.789 --> 56:12.389
Hey.

56:12.390 --> 56:14.391
- Did you win?
- Yeah,

56:14.392 --> 56:16.996
but my hand's gonna look
like a watermelon tomorrow.

56:19.030 --> 56:21.832
Look, I don't want to overstep
my bounds or anything,

56:21.833 --> 56:24.802
but...

56:24.803 --> 56:26.739
I know what happened
to your parents.

56:28.106 --> 56:30.140
The carjacking...

56:30.141 --> 56:32.511
and how they never found the guy.

56:38.183 --> 56:40.987
Michael, why do you really
want to fight in this thing?

56:42.220 --> 56:44.321
You didn't see it, did you?

56:44.322 --> 56:46.690
The way they looked
at him it was like

56:46.691 --> 56:49.830
they think he's some hero.

56:50.829 --> 56:53.099
They don't even know.

56:54.866 --> 56:56.767
It was him, wasn't it?

56:56.768 --> 56:59.904
Look, I gotta get on a
better sleeping schedule.

56:59.905 --> 57:02.773
Yeah yeah, of course.

57:02.774 --> 57:05.109
- I'll let you go.
- How about dinner though?

57:05.110 --> 57:07.544
Yeah.

57:07.545 --> 57:09.113
Dinner's good.

57:09.114 --> 57:12.185
- Good night.
- Good night.

57:28.700 --> 57:29.867
What are you doing here?

57:29.868 --> 57:32.436
Just thought I'd come
a little bit early.

57:32.437 --> 57:35.205
You think I'm gonna let you teach
the kids looking like that?

57:35.206 --> 57:36.973
- I had an accident.
- Honor!

57:36.974 --> 57:39.043
Respect.

57:39.044 --> 57:41.045
That's what this is
all about, right?

57:41.046 --> 57:43.080
Well, I thought forgiveness
was a part of it too.

57:43.081 --> 57:45.082
Not if you take advantage of it.

57:45.083 --> 57:47.685
What are you really
training for, Michael?

57:47.686 --> 57:50.821
If you wanna dance around in a
cage and hurt people for money,

57:50.822 --> 57:53.694
you're in the wrong place.

57:55.226 --> 57:56.894
Yeah well, you know what?

57:56.895 --> 58:00.764
These... these mind games,
all this bowing and shit,

58:00.765 --> 58:02.599
nobody wants to see this
stuff anymore, man.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.336
Then what are you still doing here?

58:05.337 --> 58:07.838
You could've walked away any time.

58:07.839 --> 58:10.174
You're here because you
made the wrong choices

58:10.175 --> 58:13.243
and you chose to stay because
you're looking for something more.

58:13.244 --> 58:15.713
You're right. You know what?

58:15.714 --> 58:17.348
I can leave whenever I want.

58:17.349 --> 58:21.185
Then go right ahead. You
finished your hours weeks ago.

58:21.186 --> 58:24.288
I'm not training you so you can
go out and fight in some circus.

58:24.289 --> 58:27.858
- you understand me?
- Well, it's too late for that.

58:27.859 --> 58:29.896
Then get out, Michael.

58:30.662 --> 58:33.534
- Your choice.
- Fine.

58:35.233 --> 58:36.735
Hey.

58:37.469 --> 58:39.305
What?

58:40.138 --> 58:42.508
Uncle Reg!

58:45.543 --> 58:47.644
- Why don't you just tell him?
- Tell him what?

58:47.645 --> 58:50.447
Why you're fighting.
Just tell him the truth.

58:50.448 --> 58:52.716
I-I know he can be a hard-ass,
but at least he'd understand.

58:52.717 --> 58:54.952
You know I'm right.

58:54.953 --> 58:57.625
Why do you care so much anyways?

59:59.284 --> 01:00:00.951
Mr. Shaw.

01:00:00.952 --> 01:00:03.120
Come in, come in.

01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:05.792
You're a very difficult
man to find these days.

01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:10.061
I've been reviewing your, uh...

01:00:10.062 --> 01:00:11.995
your grades as of recent.

01:00:11.996 --> 01:00:15.365
You could use some
improvement in some areas.

01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:20.038
But they are exemplary in
comparison to last semester's.

01:00:20.039 --> 01:00:22.543
And as promised...

01:00:24.342 --> 01:00:26.443
here's your letter
of recommendation

01:00:26.444 --> 01:00:28.445
and a few suggestions
for some schools

01:00:28.446 --> 01:00:30.314
that would be good
for you to look at.

01:00:30.315 --> 01:00:32.316
Applications go out this month.

01:00:32.317 --> 01:00:36.553
If there's anything there
that you want me to change,

01:00:36.554 --> 01:00:38.722
just let me know.

01:00:38.723 --> 01:00:40.291
My GPA?

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.427
I wish I could.

01:00:43.428 --> 01:00:46.230
Best of luck.

01:00:46.231 --> 01:00:47.966
Thank you.

01:01:00.979 --> 01:01:02.980
Michael, this is fantastic.

01:01:02.981 --> 01:01:05.482
Yeah.

01:01:05.483 --> 01:01:07.484
And I was wondering if you could

01:01:07.485 --> 01:01:09.254
help me out with something.

01:01:13.658 --> 01:01:16.894
You know, Len Riley paid
me a visit a few days ago.

01:01:16.895 --> 01:01:18.562
Oh, yeah?

01:01:18.563 --> 01:01:20.900
It looks like he's
reopening the case.

01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:24.102
Do you know anything about that?

01:02:26.232 --> 01:02:29.169
Hit that board any harder and
the other wrist is gonna burst.

01:02:31.436 --> 01:02:34.608
- What are you doing here?
- Came to see how you were...

01:02:35.673 --> 01:02:38.243
and where you've gone
with my dinner plans.

01:02:39.477 --> 01:02:42.579
- I'm sorry, I've been...
- It's fine.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.783
It's not like I stopped eating.

01:02:46.417 --> 01:02:48.885
So your grandfather
gave me the grand tour.

01:02:48.886 --> 01:02:50.520
Oh, he did?

01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:53.258
Looks like you've got your
own place to train now.

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:58.333
- How's Reg doing?
- That's why I'm here.

01:03:06.838 --> 01:03:08.841
Let's take a walk.

01:03:14.113 --> 01:03:17.414
You know, kid, sometimes
it helps to let people in

01:03:17.415 --> 01:03:20.651
instead of coming across
like you don't care.

01:03:20.652 --> 01:03:22.919
Would it have mattered?

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.189
Probably not.

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:28.259
But at least we could've gone
about it in a different way.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.197
Reggie, the man killed my parents.

01:03:32.764 --> 01:03:34.931
A man that I finally
found after seven years,

01:03:34.932 --> 01:03:36.933
standing within a few feet.

01:03:36.934 --> 01:03:40.604
- Now I have my chance at him.
- A chance at doing what?

01:03:40.605 --> 01:03:43.440
You gonna kill this guy in front
of a couple of hundred people?

01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:45.509
I've thought about it.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.713
Sit down, man.

01:03:57.455 --> 01:03:59.892
You know when I was your age...

01:04:00.858 --> 01:04:02.961
I was in the military.

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:08.735
There's a reason those poor
bastards don't sleep at night.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.601
Killing a guy

01:04:11.602 --> 01:04:13.770
lets him off easy.

01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:16.274
But letting him live

01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:19.246
with what he's done...

01:04:20.912 --> 01:04:22.682
that's torture.

01:04:23.815 --> 01:04:26.520
After I got back...

01:04:27.418 --> 01:04:29.087
I started drinking.

01:04:31.422 --> 01:04:33.623
Your father's the one
who saved my life.

01:04:33.624 --> 01:04:36.596
And the whiskey you
saw in the drawer?

01:04:38.063 --> 01:04:41.132
Yeah, I saw you looking.

01:04:41.133 --> 01:04:42.835
It's a reminder.

01:04:43.568 --> 01:04:45.535
It tests my will.

01:04:45.536 --> 01:04:47.504
I haven't taken a sip in 15 years.

01:04:47.505 --> 01:04:49.840
Your father was my friend, Michael.

01:04:49.841 --> 01:04:52.743
And I think he turned you
into a damn good kid.

01:04:52.744 --> 01:04:55.346
You want a shot at this guy?

01:04:55.347 --> 01:04:57.014
I can't stop you.

01:04:57.015 --> 01:04:59.616
But when you step in there,

01:04:59.617 --> 01:05:02.552
everything else goes
out the window.

01:05:02.553 --> 01:05:05.525
It's about survival.

01:05:07.092 --> 01:05:09.726
And that's how we're
gonna train you for it.

01:05:09.727 --> 01:05:11.895
I'm not doin' this to help you win.

01:05:11.896 --> 01:05:15.099
In fact, I don't care if you do.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.602
I just don't want to
see you get hurt,

01:05:18.603 --> 01:05:21.372
especially not by him.

01:05:21.373 --> 01:05:23.307
Wait, I thought you said that...

01:05:23.308 --> 01:05:24.574
Shut up...

01:05:24.575 --> 01:05:26.511
before I change my mind.

01:05:27.678 --> 01:05:30.383
We start training
tomorrow, 6:00 a.m.

01:05:40.058 --> 01:05:42.160
We've only got three weeks.

01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:45.629
I can't teach you to be
better than these guys,

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:48.632
but I do have time to teach
you how to beat 'em.

01:05:48.633 --> 01:05:51.102
The fighters you're going
up against are strong.

01:05:51.103 --> 01:05:52.936
They're athletic

01:05:52.937 --> 01:05:55.373
and they know how to take a punch.

01:05:55.374 --> 01:05:57.541
You can't afford to miss.

01:05:57.542 --> 01:05:59.776
You need to rely on your speed

01:05:59.777 --> 01:06:03.613
and distance, and take as
little damage as possible.

01:06:03.614 --> 01:06:07.452
With the right timing and
the right placement,

01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:09.656
you can end it with a single punch.

01:06:12.157 --> 01:06:14.925
Your karate's there. But
after watching these guys,

01:06:14.926 --> 01:06:17.094
I can tell that won't be enough.

01:06:17.095 --> 01:06:20.031
We're gonna mix it up a bit. This
way, when you're in close range

01:06:20.032 --> 01:06:21.998
you can open up like
a son of a bitch.

01:06:21.999 --> 01:06:24.168
In the beginning
moments of that fight,

01:06:24.169 --> 01:06:26.337
you need to study him,

01:06:26.338 --> 01:06:30.107
learn his range, know what
his next move will be.

01:06:30.108 --> 01:06:32.779
Harder! Double kick!

01:06:34.279 --> 01:06:36.047
When you step in there,

01:06:36.048 --> 01:06:38.216
nothing else matters.

01:06:38.217 --> 01:06:40.084
Focus on your opponent.

01:06:40.085 --> 01:06:42.086
- You gotta watch out for the legs.
- Okay.

01:06:42.087 --> 01:06:44.255
'Cause if you can't stand,

01:06:44.256 --> 01:06:46.590
- you can't fight, right?
- Yeah.

01:06:46.591 --> 01:06:49.028
- Okay, so watch. Ready?
- Yeah.

01:06:51.163 --> 01:06:52.196
You all right?

01:06:52.197 --> 01:06:53.832
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:07:03.808 --> 01:07:05.842
When these guys get tired

01:07:05.843 --> 01:07:07.777
they start swinging for the fences.

01:07:07.778 --> 01:07:10.714
So I want you... bang!
Right down the pike.

01:07:10.715 --> 01:07:12.649
- Okay.
- Right down the pike, all right?

01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:13.951
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:18.822
Keep your hands up, all right?

01:07:18.823 --> 01:07:20.559
- Keep your hands up.
- Okay.

01:07:27.032 --> 01:07:28.367
Stop.

01:07:29.501 --> 01:07:32.306
All right, you know that control
I've been teaching you?

01:07:33.205 --> 01:07:35.074
Lose it.

01:07:40.878 --> 01:07:42.480
Hey!

01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:43.782
Nice.

01:07:46.084 --> 01:07:48.152
Now there's these guys
I want you to meet.

01:07:48.153 --> 01:07:50.587
They'll be able to help you
with your ground game.

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:51.688
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:51.689 --> 01:07:53.524
If you got a fighting chance,

01:07:53.525 --> 01:07:55.692
it's because of them.

01:07:55.693 --> 01:07:57.896
Just try to keep up with them.

01:08:27.593 --> 01:08:29.529
Good, bud.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.767
Are you Reggie's guy?

01:08:37.768 --> 01:08:39.437
Yeah. Michael.

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:41.875
Michael.

01:08:47.412 --> 01:08:48.479
What's up?

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.082
Hey, Lyoto. This is the kid.

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:54.285
You can't be serious. He's
tiny and looks malnourished.

01:08:54.286 --> 01:08:55.319
I know.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.821
It's impossible. He
doesn't stand a chance.

01:08:57.822 --> 01:09:02.993
Well, we've seen worse.
Impossible is what we do.

01:09:02.993 --> 01:09:05.595
Guess we can try.

01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:08.299
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.832
All right then.

01:09:09.834 --> 01:09:11.337
Let's do it.

01:09:12.703 --> 01:09:15.406
All right. Your first lesson today

01:09:15.407 --> 01:09:18.841
is the sprawl. This is
very very important.

01:09:18.843 --> 01:09:20.712
Okay.

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:28.185
Okay. Let me introduce
you to my little friend,

01:09:28.185 --> 01:09:30.354
the medicine ball.

01:09:30.354 --> 01:09:32.090
Let's go, sprawl.

01:09:32.857 --> 01:09:35.326
Go, sprawl!

01:09:35.327 --> 01:09:36.993
Go! Fast!

01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:38.029
Come on, boy.

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:40.296
This is bad position for you.

01:09:40.298 --> 01:09:42.866
You need to change faster.

01:09:42.867 --> 01:09:46.537
You need to move
your hips like this,

01:09:46.537 --> 01:09:50.511
and you put your arm
inside and... choke.

01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:54.412
And...

01:09:54.413 --> 01:09:56.447
One more.

01:09:56.448 --> 01:09:58.551
Let's go! Fast!

01:10:07.659 --> 01:10:08.927
Hai!

01:10:11.396 --> 01:10:13.364
For this kick,

01:10:13.365 --> 01:10:16.167
you have to bring your
knee up like a fake

01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:19.072
and kick with the
other leg. Like that.

01:10:20.472 --> 01:10:21.740
Try it.

01:10:27.845 --> 01:10:30.181
No no, you need more force.

01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:32.450
- So you need to put your arms in here...
- Okay.

01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:34.354
- Put your legs here.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:35.487 --> 01:10:39.156
You have a lot of position
here for the choking.

01:10:39.157 --> 01:10:40.890
First one.

01:10:40.891 --> 01:10:43.028
And this one.

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.407
No no, you have to... more force.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.090
You need to keep your working more.

01:11:26.204 --> 01:11:27.238
Great job.

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:29.607
Dentists love this kick.

01:11:29.608 --> 01:11:30.943
Go!

01:11:31.743 --> 01:11:33.244
Kick.

01:11:33.245 --> 01:11:35.112
Drop-kick.

01:11:35.113 --> 01:11:36.980
Nice. Good job.

01:11:36.981 --> 01:11:39.383
You ready for the real test?

01:11:39.384 --> 01:11:42.088
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

01:11:50.162 --> 01:11:51.797
Okay. Up your hands.

01:11:53.598 --> 01:11:54.966
Keep moving.

01:12:02.107 --> 01:12:03.475
I like this kick.

01:12:18.256 --> 01:12:20.224
I like it. Good job, buddy.

01:12:20.225 --> 01:12:22.793
- Good.
- I love it.

01:12:22.794 --> 01:12:25.732
Oof! Aw.

01:12:31.503 --> 01:12:34.408
So, uh, I think he might be ready.

01:12:35.607 --> 01:12:37.675
Thanks.

01:12:37.676 --> 01:12:39.612
- Thank you.
- Good job.

01:12:42.147 --> 01:12:43.547
Well?

01:12:43.548 --> 01:12:45.083
We'll see.

01:12:53.058 --> 01:12:55.359
Oh no. No no.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.663
Yes.

01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:06.770
Let's go, huh? Let's go.

01:13:06.771 --> 01:13:10.210
Oh me, oh my, man

01:13:11.409 --> 01:13:14.578
Didn't hesitate

01:13:14.579 --> 01:13:15.847
At all...

01:13:17.182 --> 01:13:20.117
Not a fool for fate

01:13:20.118 --> 01:13:21.485
At all

01:13:21.486 --> 01:13:24.992
He'd just take my hand

01:13:26.858 --> 01:13:29.493
I didn't understand

01:13:29.494 --> 01:13:32.733
Oh me, oh my, guy

01:13:33.798 --> 01:13:37.003
Oh, it's sportswear for you

01:13:38.536 --> 01:13:40.838
- But I've got one or two...
- Hold on.

01:13:40.839 --> 01:13:42.942
One second, one second.

01:13:45.777 --> 01:13:47.914
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

01:13:49.514 --> 01:13:51.448
He's watching.

01:13:51.449 --> 01:13:55.590
Maybe if it all works out

01:13:57.389 --> 01:14:00.990
We can get a two-bedroom house

01:14:00.991 --> 01:14:04.695
With a king-size bed

01:14:04.696 --> 01:14:09.003
And a spare room there for guests

01:14:11.369 --> 01:14:14.307
Oh, but it didn't last.

01:14:28.586 --> 01:14:30.854
This place is really falling apart.

01:14:30.855 --> 01:14:32.556
Yeah.

01:14:32.557 --> 01:14:34.792
It's been pretty tough on Reg.

01:14:34.793 --> 01:14:39.201
He can't afford the repairs, so he
insists on fixing it up himself.

01:14:41.032 --> 01:14:43.068
He just works so hard, you know?

01:14:44.069 --> 01:14:46.170
And people don't
want karate anymore.

01:14:46.171 --> 01:14:47.972
They want what they see on TV.

01:14:47.973 --> 01:14:52.309
Which is a shame because I see what
my uncle does for these kids...

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:54.680
and for you.

01:14:59.484 --> 01:15:01.219
How do I look?

01:15:08.927 --> 01:15:11.061
I know you think that
you need to do this,

01:15:11.062 --> 01:15:13.364
and that's fine.

01:15:13.365 --> 01:15:16.433
But after tomorrow I really
hope that you can make peace

01:15:16.434 --> 01:15:18.969
with everything that
you've been holding onto.

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.107
You've earned that.

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:27.506
Shake it off.

01:16:29.974 --> 01:16:33.514
Wait here. I got something for you.

01:16:46.157 --> 01:16:48.292
If I'm not mistaken,
your father said

01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:50.863
that you were just a few
months away from earning...

01:16:52.064 --> 01:16:53.999
this.

01:16:57.969 --> 01:17:00.637
Tomorrow is what it
all comes down to.

01:17:00.638 --> 01:17:03.108
Don't lose your focus.

01:17:03.109 --> 01:17:05.776
You're there for one purpose.

01:17:05.777 --> 01:17:09.313
Whatever you choose to do...

01:17:09.314 --> 01:17:12.018
don't forget what
they'd expect of you.

01:17:13.651 --> 01:17:15.552
Go home, get a good night's sleep.

01:17:15.553 --> 01:17:17.356
I'll see you there.

01:17:19.424 --> 01:17:21.727
I'm not gonna let you
coach yourself, am I?

01:17:49.454 --> 01:17:51.455
All right, y'all. All right, yo!

01:17:51.456 --> 01:17:53.290
Today is the day!

01:17:53.291 --> 01:17:57.261
We've got a sweet lineup
of fights comin' atcha

01:17:57.262 --> 01:18:00.031
that are sure not to disappoint.

01:18:00.032 --> 01:18:03.433
This is the tournament of
all tournaments, baby.

01:18:03.434 --> 01:18:05.869
Woo! This is gonna be crazy.

01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:09.007
This is gonna be live!
This is gonna be wild!

01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:12.376
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
now this is how it works.

01:18:12.377 --> 01:18:14.578
Once the preliminaries
are outta the way,

01:18:14.579 --> 01:18:18.815
we'll break and reconvene for
the final match-up at 6:00.

01:18:18.816 --> 01:18:21.919
The fighter who manages to keep
himself in the game until then

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.024
will get his shot at the $50,000

01:18:26.025 --> 01:18:29.060
against our very own
undefeated champ

01:18:29.061 --> 01:18:30.963
Dominic Gray!

01:18:37.602 --> 01:18:41.108
Let's go to war-rrr!

01:18:46.878 --> 01:18:50.114
All right, y'all, this is our
first fight of the night!

01:18:50.115 --> 01:18:52.819
We got Chino-ooo!

01:18:54.819 --> 01:18:56.687
And his opponent...

01:18:56.688 --> 01:19:00.829
Rotansky. Make some noise!

01:19:03.928 --> 01:19:05.929
Corner, sir.

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:07.631
Thank you. Mouthpiece?

01:19:07.632 --> 01:19:10.904
Cup? Good to go.

01:19:13.172 --> 01:19:14.571
Are you ready, sir?

01:19:14.572 --> 01:19:16.207
You ready?

01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:18.511
- Fight!
- Let's get it on, y'all!

01:19:23.781 --> 01:19:25.549
Oh, this is crazy already!

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:28.318
Oh, damn, oh!

01:19:28.319 --> 01:19:30.255
Oh oh!

01:19:30.256 --> 01:19:33.093
Oh, that's big trouble now... oh!

01:19:36.095 --> 01:19:37.363
Oh!

01:19:40.266 --> 01:19:42.803
Chino-ooo!

01:19:54.213 --> 01:19:55.615
Come over here, guys.

01:19:56.714 --> 01:19:58.949
Protect yourself at all time.
Obey my command at all time.

01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:01.770
If you wanna touch gloves, do it
now and go back to your corner.

01:20:03.255 --> 01:20:04.289
You ready?

01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:05.725
Fight!

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.478
See, look at him. See him?

01:20:37.122 --> 01:20:38.824
Yeah yeah!

01:20:48.633 --> 01:20:49.901
Yeah!

01:20:53.705 --> 01:20:56.673
Yo, this next match is gonna
be real interesting, man!

01:20:56.674 --> 01:20:58.375
We got a newcomer to the cage!

01:20:58.376 --> 01:21:01.882
Check it out, y'all!
We got Michael Shaw!

01:21:03.148 --> 01:21:06.383
Taking on Abraham the Firearm!

01:21:06.384 --> 01:21:07.952
Woo!

01:21:16.961 --> 01:21:18.296
Come on in, guys.

01:21:20.965 --> 01:21:23.000
Protect yourself at all times.
Obey my command at all times.

01:21:23.001 --> 01:21:25.861
If you wanna touch gloves, do it
now and go back to your corners.

01:21:26.971 --> 01:21:28.758
Let's go, guys. Step
back, step back.

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:32.342
A'ight, karate boy. Whatever,
man. I hope that helps you!

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:34.278
Nice and relaxed, Michael!

01:21:34.279 --> 01:21:36.114
Make sure you keep your hands up!

01:21:39.351 --> 01:21:41.788
Ooh, you gotta watch that
firearm. It might burn!

01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:47.158
Attaboy! Focus on the gameplan.

01:21:47.159 --> 01:21:49.930
Who's got it goin' on, man?
Let's brawl, let's brawl!

01:21:54.432 --> 01:21:56.500
Bring him out, around!

01:21:56.501 --> 01:21:57.869
Nice!

01:22:03.142 --> 01:22:05.077
Don't just stand there, move!

01:22:06.011 --> 01:22:08.179
Ohhh!

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.014
Michael Shaw, y'all!
Make some noise!

01:22:10.015 --> 01:22:11.548
Yes!

01:22:11.549 --> 01:22:13.986
- God damn, where did that come from?
- Yes!

01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:15.552
Yes!

01:22:15.553 --> 01:22:16.921
Yes!

01:22:20.225 --> 01:22:22.459
I'm telling you, we got some

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.930
round-two action for
y'all! Check this out!

01:22:26.398 --> 01:22:29.033
You wanna slap me and call
me out and flatter me

01:22:29.034 --> 01:22:31.335
I hope you won't,
but that'll be a joke

01:22:31.336 --> 01:22:32.971
But let's go...

01:22:35.207 --> 01:22:37.344
Go for broke, crazy mind...

01:22:38.643 --> 01:22:40.980
- Slam slap...
- Go go!

01:22:55.993 --> 01:22:58.129
Straight out of the adrenaline gym,

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:00.198
my man Stone

01:23:00.199 --> 01:23:02.870
- takin' on Shaw!
- Fight!

01:23:07.306 --> 01:23:08.805
I don't know how he's
gonna walk after that.

01:23:08.806 --> 01:23:10.441
Don't check the kick, come into it!

01:23:10.442 --> 01:23:12.545
Use... cover up! Cover up!

01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:19.084
Ow! You're gonna feel that
in the morning, homie!

01:23:26.091 --> 01:23:28.495
Over-powered! Where
did that come from?

01:23:33.831 --> 01:23:36.101
Left-foot triangle!

01:23:41.507 --> 01:23:43.374
There you go!

01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:44.743
That's right!

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.282
Yo, are you seeing this?

01:23:52.284 --> 01:23:56.892
- Let him go!
- Oh ho! Unbelievable!

01:23:58.556 --> 01:24:02.597
It's all over, baby! Michael
Shaw does it again!

01:24:12.937 --> 01:24:14.971
Yo, our next fight

01:24:14.972 --> 01:24:19.414
pits Chino versus Michael Shaw!

01:24:20.878 --> 01:24:23.414
Are you ready, sir?
Are you ready? Fight!

01:24:23.415 --> 01:24:25.318
Here we go, y'all!

01:24:26.717 --> 01:24:28.520
Stay on him! Stay on him!

01:24:31.756 --> 01:24:34.160
Got some high kicks there! Oooh!

01:24:36.694 --> 01:24:39.399
- Elbows in!
- Oh, you in trouble now.

01:24:41.732 --> 01:24:44.335
Whoo, Chino's mad with it tonight.

01:24:44.336 --> 01:24:46.103
Go to the body! Go to the body!

01:24:46.104 --> 01:24:48.339
He's got a strong chin!
Go to the body!

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.508
Attaboy! Attaboy!

01:24:50.509 --> 01:24:53.814
Wow! We got a fight here,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:24:55.013 --> 01:24:57.181
Put your weight down on him!

01:24:57.182 --> 01:24:59.853
No, that's too much, man.
He ain't gonna get outta that.

01:25:02.254 --> 01:25:04.256
He's about to tap!
I know he's ready to!

01:25:08.793 --> 01:25:11.095
- Yes! Go!
- Wow, man, he's got life, y'all!

01:25:11.096 --> 01:25:13.130
You gotta hand it to him!

01:25:13.131 --> 01:25:14.633
Set up your kicks, Michael!

01:25:18.136 --> 01:25:20.740
Yo, you wakin' up tomorrow
mornin' with a headache, homie.

01:25:23.475 --> 01:25:25.678
Ahhh oooh!

01:25:28.513 --> 01:25:30.449
Don't let go!

01:25:31.916 --> 01:25:34.019
Nice, Michael, nice!

01:25:34.819 --> 01:25:37.390
Michael, go go!

01:25:42.827 --> 01:25:45.929
Man, that's the heart of
a fighter right there!

01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:47.900
Hey.

01:25:57.476 --> 01:25:59.078
Oh!

01:25:59.810 --> 01:26:02.079
Really?! What?

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.881
I don't know how he pulled
it off again, y'all,

01:26:04.882 --> 01:26:06.816
- but give it up!
- Yes!

01:26:06.817 --> 01:26:09.889
That right there is Michael Shaw!

01:26:16.194 --> 01:26:19.333
Looks like we got ourselves an
underdog up in here, y'all!

01:26:20.698 --> 01:26:22.634
Can you believe this?

01:26:24.136 --> 01:26:26.103
All right, y'all. All right, yo.

01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:28.938
We are down to our
final fight of the day,

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:30.940
one hour to go,

01:26:30.941 --> 01:26:34.011
and the only thing coming
in between karate boy here

01:26:34.012 --> 01:26:36.913
and 50,000 big ones

01:26:36.914 --> 01:26:39.150
is this motherfucker.

01:26:39.151 --> 01:26:42.423
Get up here, homie.

01:26:44.022 --> 01:26:46.157
Yeah, this...

01:26:46.158 --> 01:26:49.126
is what you've all
been waiting for...

01:26:49.127 --> 01:26:52.663
a new contender to challenge

01:26:52.664 --> 01:26:54.731
the undefeated reign.

01:26:54.732 --> 01:26:57.034
All right, so yo. Y'all
can grab your snacks,

01:26:57.035 --> 01:26:59.803
all right, grab some beers.
Hey, make sure y'all tweet

01:26:59.804 --> 01:27:03.043
about how crazy these fights
have been, all right?

01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:11.250
That karate shit?

01:27:12.484 --> 01:27:14.219
Ain't workin' on me, kid.

01:27:15.853 --> 01:27:17.921
Costume's cute.

01:27:17.922 --> 01:27:19.523
But this right here?

01:27:19.524 --> 01:27:21.991
This right here is the real deal.

01:27:21.992 --> 01:27:23.060
Love you!

01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:26.099
Luck got you through
those other guys.

01:27:27.466 --> 01:27:30.270
It's gonna take God to
get you through me.

01:27:31.869 --> 01:27:33.970
Just try it, kid!

01:27:33.971 --> 01:27:36.241
I'm gonna destroy you.

01:27:38.376 --> 01:27:41.145
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah, let's fight!

01:27:41.146 --> 01:27:43.783
- Bring it on, turn it up!
- What's he gonna say?

01:27:45.117 --> 01:27:47.019
Hey, man, you gotta say something.

01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:54.458
Say something!

01:27:54.459 --> 01:27:57.961
When I was 12 years old,

01:27:57.962 --> 01:28:00.634
I watched my parents die.

01:28:01.932 --> 01:28:03.867
A man walked up to our car,

01:28:03.868 --> 01:28:06.940
waving his gun in my father's face.

01:28:08.906 --> 01:28:12.376
And he shot him.

01:28:12.377 --> 01:28:15.546
My mother was sitting there,

01:28:15.547 --> 01:28:18.716
just crying,

01:28:18.717 --> 01:28:20.887
pleading for her life.

01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:25.456
But that didn't make a difference.

01:28:25.457 --> 01:28:28.161
And he shot her too.

01:28:30.695 --> 01:28:32.631
And he never saw me.

01:28:35.167 --> 01:28:38.372
But I saw him.

01:28:39.538 --> 01:28:41.508
Remember that.

01:28:49.014 --> 01:28:53.120
Well, hey! Whatever makes the
fight more exciting, right?

01:28:58.824 --> 01:29:00.658
Ha ha ha, kid!

01:29:00.659 --> 01:29:03.427
Yo, I don't know where that
deep shit came from, man,

01:29:03.428 --> 01:29:05.995
but people are goin' nuts to
watch you fight this guy.

01:29:05.996 --> 01:29:09.233
Hey, we can all walk away with
some serious dough tonight.

01:29:09.234 --> 01:29:11.202
I never doubted you, man.

01:29:11.203 --> 01:29:14.271
- I swear, from the moment I met you...
- Would you excuse us?

01:29:14.272 --> 01:29:17.444
No problem. Do whatcha
gotta do, man.

01:29:24.249 --> 01:29:25.716
This is it.

01:29:25.717 --> 01:29:27.351
How do you feel?

01:29:27.352 --> 01:29:29.687
Good.

01:29:29.688 --> 01:29:31.622
Look at me, man.

01:29:31.623 --> 01:29:34.024
I don't care how big this guy is.

01:29:34.025 --> 01:29:36.026
I don't care how mean he is.

01:29:36.027 --> 01:29:37.994
I don't care about his reputation.

01:29:37.995 --> 01:29:40.164
You're gonna beat this guy.

01:29:40.165 --> 01:29:42.402
You're gonna do it for them.

01:29:43.802 --> 01:29:45.836
- Right?
- Right.

01:29:45.837 --> 01:29:47.974
All right.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:14.198
Look, I don't know
what this is about

01:30:14.199 --> 01:30:16.367
and I don't care.

01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:19.336
But if there's even a hint of truth

01:30:19.337 --> 01:30:21.272
to what that kid is saying,

01:30:21.273 --> 01:30:24.578
when you hit, you hit
to put him down...

01:30:25.677 --> 01:30:27.077
for good.

01:30:27.078 --> 01:30:29.079
You understand what
I'm tellin' you?

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.614
I gotcha.

01:30:30.615 --> 01:30:32.583
Dominic! Dominic!

01:30:32.584 --> 01:30:35.422
Dominic! Dominic! Dominic!

01:30:47.098 --> 01:30:50.567
All right, y'all. This is it.

01:30:50.568 --> 01:30:53.203
This is the one you've
been waiting for, y'all!

01:30:53.204 --> 01:30:56.973
$50,000 is on the line!

01:30:56.974 --> 01:30:59.176
The final match-up!

01:30:59.177 --> 01:31:02.479
We got Michael Shaw

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.815
takin' on your champion,

01:31:04.816 --> 01:31:08.623
the undefeated Dominic Gray!

01:31:13.792 --> 01:31:16.760
We've got a real David vs.
Goliath here tonight, baby!

01:31:16.761 --> 01:31:19.430
Okay, gentlemen, come
over here, please.

01:31:19.431 --> 01:31:20.898
Both of you.

01:31:20.899 --> 01:31:23.267
Protect yourself at all time.
Obey my command at all time.

01:31:23.268 --> 01:31:26.503
If you wanna touch gloves, do it
now and go back to your corners.

01:31:26.504 --> 01:31:29.074
Okay, step back,
guys. Let's do this.

01:31:31.476 --> 01:31:33.713
Stay on your toes, man,
and watch your chin.

01:31:35.013 --> 01:31:37.848
Are you ready, sir? You ready?

01:31:37.849 --> 01:31:39.318
Fight!

01:31:45.190 --> 01:31:46.757
Move, Michael, move!

01:31:46.758 --> 01:31:49.028
A lotta movement. Attaboy!

01:31:54.165 --> 01:31:56.535
Stick and move! Stick and move!

01:31:58.136 --> 01:32:02.242
Yo, kid, you might as well
just tap out now, man.

01:32:03.009 --> 01:32:05.045
Circle away from the power hand!

01:32:11.349 --> 01:32:13.617
For a guy who saw his mother
get shot in the face,

01:32:13.618 --> 01:32:15.755
you hit like a little bitch.

01:32:22.994 --> 01:32:25.399
Don't stand in front
of this guy, Michael!

01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:34.707
Hang in there! Hang in there!

01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:39.745
Get up! Get up, Michael! Get up!

01:32:42.247 --> 01:32:44.515
Stay with him, Michael. Hold him!

01:32:44.516 --> 01:32:46.653
Hold him down!

01:32:52.323 --> 01:32:54.458
Stop. Step aside.
Don't do that shit.

01:32:54.459 --> 01:32:56.829
Dominic Gray is a bad man!

01:32:58.329 --> 01:33:00.933
Next time you do that
I will disqualify you.

01:33:09.974 --> 01:33:11.577
Sit down, Michael.

01:33:12.343 --> 01:33:14.413
Breathe.

01:33:18.516 --> 01:33:20.018
Deep breaths.

01:33:20.752 --> 01:33:23.520
Michael, look at me. What are
you doing out there, man?

01:33:23.521 --> 01:33:25.056
You fighting out of anger?

01:33:25.057 --> 01:33:27.257
Where's your technique, huh?

01:33:27.258 --> 01:33:29.893
Where's your technique? Everything
we worked on in the gym.

01:33:29.894 --> 01:33:31.662
Remember that, right?

01:33:31.663 --> 01:33:33.464
Punch and move! Punch and move!

01:33:33.465 --> 01:33:35.899
Stay away from him! Don't
get into those clinches.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.068
Look at me.

01:33:37.069 --> 01:33:40.105
You can beat this guy. All right?

01:33:40.106 --> 01:33:42.473
Okay, gentlemen, seconds out.

01:33:42.474 --> 01:33:44.675
All right? Relax.

01:33:44.676 --> 01:33:46.713
- Let's go, guys.
- Stay away from him.

01:33:51.583 --> 01:33:52.985
Fight!

01:34:02.427 --> 01:34:03.962
Watch the spacing!

01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:07.399
Attaboy! Attaboy!

01:34:13.105 --> 01:34:15.007
Ha!

01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:19.578
Oooh!

01:34:31.422 --> 01:34:33.091
Breathe!

01:34:43.801 --> 01:34:45.903
Oh! Watch the knees, baby!

01:34:45.904 --> 01:34:48.576
Those things will crack
your skull open, y'all.

01:34:53.978 --> 01:34:55.812
Oooh!

01:34:55.813 --> 01:34:57.716
Damn!

01:35:00.685 --> 01:35:02.352
Go to his legs!

01:35:02.353 --> 01:35:04.188
Good! Do it again!

01:35:08.093 --> 01:35:09.361
Ahh!

01:35:10.395 --> 01:35:12.329
Get his legs!

01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:13.765
Break!

01:35:15.134 --> 01:35:17.136
Go back to your corner, sir.

01:35:25.476 --> 01:35:29.047
- Sit down, man, sit down.
- It's beautiful, Michael. Beautiful.

01:35:29.048 --> 01:35:32.252
Why the fuck haven't you
finished this kid already, Dom?

01:35:33.052 --> 01:35:34.818
This guy's hurt. He's tired.

01:35:34.819 --> 01:35:37.554
- You can beat this guy.
- Talk to me, Dom.

01:35:37.555 --> 01:35:38.855
What the fuck is going on?

01:35:38.856 --> 01:35:41.291
- How's the knee?
- Fuck the knee.

01:35:41.292 --> 01:35:43.527
- Fuck this kid.
- Stay on his legs.

01:35:43.528 --> 01:35:45.096
You can beat this guy.

01:35:45.097 --> 01:35:46.763
Look at me!

01:35:46.764 --> 01:35:49.000
You're Dominic fuckin' Gray.
Finish this kid right fuckin' now!

01:35:49.001 --> 01:35:50.867
Make him know what it feels
like to lose everything.

01:35:50.868 --> 01:35:53.770
All right? Now go out
there, finish him!

01:35:53.771 --> 01:35:55.739
- Let's go! Seconds out!
- Put pressure on him.

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.641
Use your power. Use your power.

01:35:57.642 --> 01:35:59.710
Make it quick. Let's go go go.

01:35:59.711 --> 01:36:02.679
Go, sir. You have to get
outta here. Get outta here.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.348
- Let's go.
- Don't worry about it.

01:36:04.349 --> 01:36:05.809
- Get outta here.
- Yeah yeah.

01:36:11.322 --> 01:36:13.859
Stay in your corner, sir.
Stay in your corner.

01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:17.195
Your stool.

01:36:17.196 --> 01:36:19.963
- Hey!
- He fucking grabbed my hand.

01:36:19.964 --> 01:36:22.802
I'm okay. Hey, he's
locking the gate.

01:36:27.139 --> 01:36:29.342
- Give me the key.
- Get the fuck outta here!

01:36:30.475 --> 01:36:32.345
- Hey, watch it!
- Back off, back off.

01:36:33.978 --> 01:36:36.483
Michael!

01:36:40.485 --> 01:36:43.457
- Michael, what are you doing?
- What the fuck's he doing?

01:36:48.826 --> 01:36:50.662
He's staying in the cage.

01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:01.341
Take your time!

01:37:09.747 --> 01:37:11.884
You see this kid?

01:37:21.492 --> 01:37:23.194
Nobody escapes.

01:37:34.273 --> 01:37:36.606
Don't fight it.

01:37:36.607 --> 01:37:38.910
Don't fight it.

01:37:40.312 --> 01:37:43.351
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:47.384
Mama.

01:37:47.385 --> 01:37:49.087
Mom.

01:37:50.755 --> 01:37:52.889
Don't worry.

01:37:52.890 --> 01:37:55.762
You'll be with your
Mommy and Daddy soon.

01:37:58.097 --> 01:38:00.564
He ain't gonna wake up.
Yeah, that's it, man.

01:38:00.565 --> 01:38:03.704
Grab your right leg, Michael!
Grab your right leg!

01:38:09.841 --> 01:38:13.146
No way! No way!

01:38:26.924 --> 01:38:30.296
No way. I don't know what
I'm seeing, but I like it.

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:38.270
Ooh!

01:38:54.219 --> 01:38:55.654
Oh shit.

01:39:42.034 --> 01:39:43.669
Oh fuck!

01:39:47.139 --> 01:39:49.576
Yeah yeah!

01:39:58.317 --> 01:39:59.850
Crazy!

01:39:59.851 --> 01:40:01.554
Hey, go ahead. Do your thing.

01:40:12.431 --> 01:40:14.701
Yeah!

01:40:57.543 --> 01:40:59.643
Loser!

01:40:59.644 --> 01:41:01.279
Loser!

01:41:08.753 --> 01:41:09.886
Hey yo!

01:41:09.887 --> 01:41:12.023
We have ourselves a winner, y'all!

01:41:12.024 --> 01:41:13.757
Ha ha!

01:41:13.758 --> 01:41:17.094
Hey, $50,000, y'all!

01:41:17.095 --> 01:41:19.497
Every penny, man.
I'm a man of my word.

01:41:19.498 --> 01:41:21.566
It's just like I said,
"If it comes from Lou,

01:41:21.567 --> 01:41:23.900
you know it's true." Hey hey, look,

01:41:23.901 --> 01:41:26.670
but don't touch, baby. Yeah, hey,

01:41:26.671 --> 01:41:28.406
this is all you, kid.

01:41:28.407 --> 01:41:29.839
You earned it, man.

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.879
It's all you, baby.

01:41:37.782 --> 01:41:39.350
For the dojo.

01:41:39.351 --> 01:41:42.022
- But, Michael...
- Shut up before I change my mind.

01:41:44.356 --> 01:41:45.991
Thank you.

01:41:47.892 --> 01:41:51.632
All the flowers fade

01:41:53.131 --> 01:41:55.966
And the stars pale...

01:41:55.967 --> 01:41:58.269
Michael! Michael! Michael!

01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:00.338
As this bitter beauty...

01:42:00.339 --> 01:42:02.573
Michael! Michael! Michael!

01:42:02.574 --> 01:42:05.746
Grabs you by the tail

01:42:06.811 --> 01:42:09.916
How long will you hesitate

01:42:12.017 --> 01:42:15.219
Halfway up the trail?

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:18.926
Yeah, it's dark in the trees

01:42:20.858 --> 01:42:24.331
And some wounds never heal

01:42:25.063 --> 01:42:27.797
But you're dreaming

01:42:27.798 --> 01:42:31.472
With eyes wide open

01:42:32.571 --> 01:42:36.378
Your heart has spoken

01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:41.149
For the first time...

01:42:55.127 --> 01:42:56.960
All right, everyone, line up.

01:42:56.961 --> 01:42:59.597
Fall in, guys. Feet together.

01:42:59.598 --> 01:43:01.401
All the penny wishes...

01:43:02.601 --> 01:43:04.201
Ready?

01:43:04.202 --> 01:43:06.071
One...

01:43:07.639 --> 01:43:09.674
two...

01:43:09.675 --> 01:43:11.642
three...

01:43:11.643 --> 01:43:14.815
Splitting at the seams

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:19.654
And you're standing in the doorway

01:43:20.686 --> 01:43:23.925
With your hair all in a mess

01:43:26.224 --> 01:43:29.593
You in all your glory

01:43:29.594 --> 01:43:33.997
Wondering what comes next

01:43:33.998 --> 01:43:36.800
And you're dreaming

01:43:36.801 --> 01:43:41.706
With eyes wide open

01:43:41.707 --> 01:43:45.875
Your heart has spoken

01:43:45.876 --> 01:43:50.818
For the first time

01:43:52.917 --> 01:43:55.586
Yeah, you're dreaming

01:43:55.587 --> 01:43:59.856
With eyes wide open

01:43:59.857 --> 01:44:03.898
Your heart has spoken...

01:44:27.952 --> 01:44:29.786
You think they'd be proud?

01:44:29.787 --> 01:44:32.157
They've always been proud.
