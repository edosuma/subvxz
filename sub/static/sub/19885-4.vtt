01:24.017 --> 01:26.284

to school soon,

01:26.319 --> 01:29.521

02:13.733 --> 02:15.333
- Hello, little miss.

02:15.368 --> 02:19.371
- And you'll need to test the pie's
doneness with a small knife.

02:19.406 --> 02:23.375
- I will. - Watch the clock carefully,
Anne, so as not to burn it.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.178
- I will.
- I don't want to return from Rachel's

02:26.213 --> 02:28.380
to find Green Gables
a smoldering ruin.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.448
- I will.
- What?

02:30.483 --> 02:33.051
- I mean I won't.
I mean it won't.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.053
Don't worry, I'll go right in.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.892
Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home.

02:40.927 --> 02:44.763
Your house is on fire
and your children are home.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.733
- Anne!
- I'm going!

02:50.136 --> 02:51.803
(bleating)

02:54.975 --> 02:58.276
All except one
and that's little Anne,

02:58.311 --> 03:01.747
for she crept
under the frying pan.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.323
<i>- And I'm at my wits' end.</i>
<i>- Well...</i>

03:11.358 --> 03:14.125
since you've asked
for my advice, Marilla,

03:14.160 --> 03:17.395
I would humour her
a little while longer.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.999
- You really think it's better
she continue to stay at home?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.635
- Yes. That is,
I wouldn't say "school" again

03:23.670 --> 03:26.271
until she's said it herself.
And she will.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.607
She won't be underfoot forever.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.642
- Truth is, I'm torn.

03:31.811 --> 03:36.181
Bright as she is, she had
such a difficult start in life,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.783
she isn't always...
equipped for certain things.

03:38.818 --> 03:42.554
More's the pity: she had
such a longing for school.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.823
- Bide your time,
I'm telling you.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.159
Anne is a clever one and all.
Too clever by half.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.595
She'll go back,
that's for sure and certain.

03:50.630 --> 03:54.866
It's hard to have lofty ideas when
you're stuck in a kitchen all day.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.502
- Speak for yourself.
(Rachel laughing)

03:57.537 --> 04:01.239
- She'll soon cool off
in a week or so.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.775
- Or so?
- Patience. Mark my words.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.946
Soon enough, she'll go back
of her own accord.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.648
- God willing.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.660
- I think this length
is fetching, Griselda.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.128
Yes.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.031
Yes, this will do nicely
for dancing.

04:27.434 --> 04:31.503
Perhaps you could fashion a small loop
at the hem so I can lift the train?

04:31.538 --> 04:33.004
(crackling)

04:33.039 --> 04:36.341
I do so appreciate all your
careful attentions, Griselda.

04:36.376 --> 04:40.578
I think it's ever so important to
give credit where credit is due.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.648
How awful it would be
to be in service of those

04:43.683 --> 04:45.884
who neglect you
or treat you unkindly.

04:46.820 --> 04:51.890
I can imagine that it would make you
feel quite small and hopeless...

04:51.925 --> 04:55.260
and occasionally despairing
and lacking in confidence.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.598
I wonder if those feelings
ever go away.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.835
I'll take tea in the library,
Griselda!

05:03.870 --> 05:06.304
Today I'm going
to climb the ladder

05:06.339 --> 05:10.175
to reach the loneliest book
on the highest shelf...

05:10.210 --> 05:12.510
- Oh, dear God! Anne!

05:12.545 --> 05:15.013
- Marilla? Oh, the pie!

05:15.048 --> 05:17.882
(clatter) - Oh! Out of the way!
- I'm sorry!

05:17.917 --> 05:20.919
Marilla, I'm so sorry, I forgot!
- I am aware!

05:20.954 --> 05:25.090
Don't just stand there with your teeth
in your head. Open the door. Ah!

05:27.427 --> 05:29.027
(distant whinnying)

05:29.062 --> 05:32.263
Oh... Fetch the slop bucket.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.899
Although I'm not sure
this is even fit for pigs!

05:34.934 --> 05:36.635
- I'm very sorry, Marilla.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.138
I meant to watch the clock.
Truly, I did.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.173
I was having
the most delightful daydream.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.342
- Your mind is idle, Anne.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.877
- It isn't idle at all.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.680
I was imagining
that I'm wise Princess Cordelia,

05:48.715 --> 05:51.683
and I only have to touch
a book to know its contents.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.986
- This has gone on long enough.
- No one thinks she's strange at all.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.788
In fact, she's embraced
for being different.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.257
- Life is not magic, Anne.
- I know.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.393
- You can't just wish yourself
away.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.262
I'm raising you
and I know what's best.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.564
It's high time
you went back to school.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.267
- Please don't make me, Marilla!
Please! I can't face it!

06:09.302 --> 06:11.703
(crying): I promise
I'll do better here, I promise!

06:11.738 --> 06:14.973
- You can stop all your bargaining,
'cause there's no use in it.

06:15.008 --> 06:18.009
- But Matthew said I didn't
have to go back! - What now?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.145
- He understands that school
is a torment for me.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.580
But of course he'd understand!
He's a kindred spirit!

06:22.615 --> 06:24.516
I don't have any friends!

06:24.551 --> 06:26.117
- You've got Diana.
- No!

06:26.152 --> 06:29.421
She can't like me when no one else does!
Don't you see?!

06:29.456 --> 06:31.122
- Calm yourself.
- And Gil...

06:31.157 --> 06:34.526
Well, there's a boy whose sole
purpose in life is to humiliate me!

06:34.561 --> 06:37.495
- Stuff and nonsense.
- I don't fit in!

06:37.530 --> 06:41.700
- You're going back to school
tomorrow and that's final.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.736
(sobbing)

06:46.506 --> 06:48.740
(intense violin music)

07:05.492 --> 07:07.492
(cattle lowing)

07:14.334 --> 07:18.269
- Matthew Cuthbert, the time has
come to end this foolishness.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.473
I have allowed you to interfere
and coddle that child!

07:21.508 --> 07:23.541
- I was only sympathizing.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.377
- Did we or did we not agree
that her raising is up to me?

07:26.412 --> 07:28.913
- I didn't... mean
to put my oar in.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.483
I hate it when she's upset,
is all.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.919
- Well, I hope you're happy,
'cause she's inside right now,

07:34.954 --> 07:36.621
waltzing around
a smoldering kitchen!

07:36.656 --> 07:40.358
- She does seem to be
a bit at sixes and sevens.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.895
- A bit? She almost burnt down
our home!

07:44.831 --> 07:46.431
(man):<i> Move,</i>
<i>ya little scarecrow!</i>

07:46.466 --> 07:49.067
(woman):<i> Nothing but</i>
<i>a miserable piece of trash!</i>

07:49.102 --> 07:53.338
(girl):<i> Don't worry, Anne.</i>
<i>I'll always be your friend.</i>

07:53.373 --> 07:55.039
<i>We have each other.</i>

07:55.074 --> 07:56.808
- Katie?

07:56.843 --> 07:59.477
Katie, is that you?

07:59.512 --> 08:01.646
(breathing raggedly)

08:01.681 --> 08:03.348
(sniffling)

08:06.352 --> 08:08.186
Katie Maurice...

08:10.390 --> 08:12.557
...are you in there?

08:15.395 --> 08:17.128
Please, Katie.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.130
Please.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.132
(sobbing)

08:21.167 --> 08:25.737
I'm sorry I had to leave you
at Mrs. Hammond's.

08:28.241 --> 08:32.577
You have no idea how grateful
I'd be if you'd visit me here.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.084
Katie?

08:41.788 --> 08:44.255
(Marilla):<i> Idle hands</i>
<i>are the devil's workshop.</i>

08:44.290 --> 08:47.458
So if it's alright with you,
even though you know best,

08:47.493 --> 08:50.695
I would like to suggest that
she return to school tomorrow.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.299
(cattle lowing)

08:56.269 --> 08:58.136
(soft music)

09:31.638 --> 09:33.972
(bell ringing)
(birds cawing)

09:51.691 --> 09:53.825
(door creaking)

09:53.860 --> 09:55.727
What brings you inside
this time of day?

09:57.030 --> 10:00.031
What is it you need, Matthew?
- I...

10:01.534 --> 10:03.001
I'll take a coffee.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.602
- At three in the afternoon?

10:04.637 --> 10:07.005
- Or... or tea.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.508
- Tea will be ready at 4:00,
just like every other day.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.944
- Right, then.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.150
- She'll get used to school
soon enough,

10:19.185 --> 10:21.185
same as all the other children.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.554
- But...
- But what?

10:23.589 --> 10:26.324
- Anne's not like the others.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.793
- You're too soft with her,
Matthew.

10:28.828 --> 10:32.697
We'll not ask her too many questions when
she gets back. Can we agree on that?

10:32.732 --> 10:34.899
I don't want to open
a can of worms.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.901
She'll learn to like it,
and that's that.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.104
- Afternoon. Anne?

10:40.206 --> 10:41.940
- Anne?

10:43.009 --> 10:45.910
- I'm sure you're both wondering
how the school day went.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.913
I'm pleased to report
it wasn't as bad as I thought.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.849
I enjoyed myself.
(sighing with relief)

10:51.884 --> 10:53.618
- Well, that's just fine.

10:54.854 --> 10:57.355
Do you not have homework?
Where are your books?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.891
- Oh, I didn't need
to bring them home today.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.427
I'll go put this down
on the bench.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.866
Hello, Katie?

11:08.901 --> 11:11.436
I brought you
your favourite flower.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.439
It's a wild rose.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.578
Katie... I wish you were here.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.847
(Marilla): Come along, Anne.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.006
(birds squawking)

11:50.610 --> 11:52.510
(rooster crowing)

11:55.014 --> 11:57.782
- Well, my bed's all made! May I
take an extra apple, Marilla,

11:57.817 --> 12:00.151
in case I have a friend
to share it with?

12:00.186 --> 12:02.520
- Help yourself.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.690
- Isn't it wonderful that every
day can be an adventure?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.625
- You're chipper this morning.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.861
- It all depends
on how you look at things.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.331
Well, I'm all ready for school.
I'll just go fetch my hat.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.377
I'm expecting to learn
about the...

12:26.412 --> 12:28.813
District of Saskatchewan today.

12:28.848 --> 12:32.684
Isn't Saskatchewan just the most
delicious name to say?

12:36.222 --> 12:37.922
I'd like to go there someday.

12:39.058 --> 12:42.026
It's exciting to learn about
all the places one might go.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.495
I think the Prairies
hold a lot of appeal.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.765
Well, time to go!
Goodbye, Marilla.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.734
I hope
you don't envy me too much

12:49.769 --> 12:52.237
in this time of great learning
in my young life.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.610
(cattle lowing)

13:06.853 --> 13:10.521
- Anne stays so late in school.
She enjoys it now?

13:10.556 --> 13:12.824
- It seems she does.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.059
- Thank you.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.112
Hello, ladies.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.581
- Hello.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.123
(knocking)

13:50.329 --> 13:52.129
- Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.564
- Good afternoon, Diana.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.433
- This is Miss Ruby Gillis.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.301
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.936
What brings you both by?

13:58.971 --> 14:01.973
- We thought Anne might like to
have her books and everything.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.507
- Nice to meet you.
Come on, Diana.

14:03.542 --> 14:07.812
- We've been worrying about her.
Isn't that right, Ruby?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.315
- Diana especially.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.352
- Did something happen?
- Anne's suffering, isn't she?

14:14.387 --> 14:18.756
I just know it. Anne is too
sensitive for this world.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.925
That's what she told me once,
anyway.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.361
Is she truly
never coming back to school?

14:23.396 --> 14:27.098
- If she's not,
then we can sit together, Diana.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.236
- When did you last see her?

14:32.271 --> 14:34.272
- It's been days and days.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.108
I never imagined
she wouldn't come back.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.943
- Neither did I.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.945
- May we say hello to her?

14:40.980 --> 14:42.813
- Anne is... running an errand
at present,

14:42.848 --> 14:45.549
but I'll be sure to tell her
you were here.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.251
- Please do, Miss Cuthbert.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.520
Please tell Anne
I miss her very much.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.257
- You can count on it.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.999
- The name Saskatchewan originated
with the Plains Indians.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.101
Their word
was "kisiskatchewan,"

15:04.136 --> 15:06.837
meaning the river
that flows swiftly,

15:06.872 --> 15:10.608
in reference to the most important
waterways running through their territory,

15:10.643 --> 15:13.444
the North and South
Saskatchewan Rivers.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.814
I love the way Native names always
mean something specific, don't you?

15:16.849 --> 15:20.785
I wonder what my name would be if
I was a North American Native?

15:22.154 --> 15:24.655
Fire-Haired Dreamer?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.824
Or maybe...

15:26.859 --> 15:29.694
She Who Speaks With Trees.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.999
I know.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.667
Kindred Spirit.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.269
That could work!

15:39.705 --> 15:42.373
What's that, dear Griselda?

15:44.043 --> 15:47.345
Yes, you're right, as usual.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.550
It's getting late and your
princess must away to her castle.

15:55.054 --> 15:58.890
I'll see you in the bright and
shiny morning, dear students.

16:05.833 --> 16:09.134
Sorry I'm late.
There was just so much to learn!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.537
- How was the District
of Saskatchewan?

16:11.572 --> 16:14.306
- Oh, fascinating.
I had another excellent day.

16:14.341 --> 16:18.711
I learned so much and I imagine Mr.
Phillips was quite impressed and...

16:57.918 --> 17:01.320
- And she lied
and then lied some more.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.189
Right to our faces.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.192
I've been doing my best
to teach her right from wrong,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.027
but, well,
this matter is so grave

17:09.062 --> 17:11.530
that we knew
we had to bring it to you.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.398
- Indeed, indeed.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.200
You did right.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.337
It's a very good thing I'm here.

17:19.573 --> 17:22.541
God frowns on fibbing,
young lady.

17:22.576 --> 17:24.710
- I imagine he does.

17:24.745 --> 17:27.512
I see now
how truly wrong I was.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.948
- Wrong and disrespectful.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.751
- I assure you, Minister,
I am full of woe.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.519
- Yes--
- And also dismay.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.155
With a good measure of chagrin.

17:37.124 --> 17:41.827
I can only hope it pleases God
to know how truly unhappy I am.

17:41.862 --> 17:43.161
Does it?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.730
- That is something
you must pray on.

17:44.765 --> 17:47.799
Now, Anne,
you must always remember:

17:47.834 --> 17:49.835
honesty is the best policy.

17:49.870 --> 17:53.572
- Honesty isn't actually
a policy, though, is it?

17:53.607 --> 17:55.440
- I beg your pardon?
(Marilla): Anne!

17:55.475 --> 17:57.109
- Well, I believe that wh--

17:57.144 --> 17:59.311
- I see now
what you're up against.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.079
It doesn't matter
what you think!

18:01.114 --> 18:02.948
- About anything, or--

18:02.983 --> 18:06.151
- Do you agree
never to lie again?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.521
- Is a lie of omission
really a lie?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.423
- You see? She's not sorry.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.925
- I am sorry, Marilla.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.960
I truly am sorry
for vexing you and for--

18:14.995 --> 18:16.795
- You said
you were going to school.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.399
- I went in a fashion. - Do you take us
for fools? - But they hate me there!

18:20.434 --> 18:24.369
- Enough! You must learn
to harness yourself.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.873
I see what the problem is here.
Oh, yes, I do indeed.

18:27.908 --> 18:30.375
And I have divined an answer.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.045
This problem is easily solved.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.916
If the girl doesn't want to go to
school, then she shouldn't go.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.518
She should stay home

18:39.553 --> 18:43.522
and learn proper housekeeping
until she marries.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.328
Then the Lord God said,

18:49.363 --> 18:52.197
"It is not good that the man
should be alone;

18:52.232 --> 18:55.067
I will make him a helper
fit for him."

18:56.870 --> 19:00.539
There's no need for her
to bother with an education.

19:00.574 --> 19:04.643
Every young woman should learn
how to be a good wife.

19:08.682 --> 19:11.137
- I don't know quite what
I expected the minister

19:11.163 --> 19:13.151
to say, but I assure
you it wasn't that.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.157
And I fear preparing
myself to be a wife will

19:15.183 --> 19:16.981
be a powerful challenge
for you, Marilla.

19:21.962 --> 19:25.764
Admittedly...
I'm very homely and clumsy.

19:25.799 --> 19:29.334
It'll be a big surprise to
both of us if I marry someday.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.104
I certainly never expected to,
but if God decrees it--

19:32.139 --> 19:35.507
- Will you please go in the barn and
see if there's anything needs doing?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.710
I need to hear myself think.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.945
(sighing)

19:42.049 --> 19:44.850
- Marilla wants me to find
some outdoor chores to do.

19:44.885 --> 19:46.685
- Jerry's in the loft.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.088
He'll tell you what needs doing.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.998
- You're so lucky to be a boy,
Jerry.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.234
Boys can do anything you want.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.770
And boys have every opportunity.

20:04.805 --> 20:06.605
- You can go to school
if you want.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.374
- Wait. Does that mean school's
out of the question for you?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.176
- Where do you think
I'd rather be?

20:11.211 --> 20:12.744
- I hadn't really thought
about it.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.946
There are so many things I
hadn't thought of before today.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.582
I don't see how I'm ever gonna
be a good wife, quite frankly.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.218
- Probably not.
- I have such a bad temper.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.853
- True.
- And I'm dreadfully wicked,

20:21.888 --> 20:25.524
and impatient and skinny and homely.
Don't say anything, Jerry!

20:27.994 --> 20:31.830
I never thought
that a wife is what I would be.

20:34.835 --> 20:36.335
(sighing)

20:40.841 --> 20:42.508
(soft music)

21:11.738 --> 21:14.506
There have to be other options.
What do you want to be?

21:15.509 --> 21:16.975
- I do this.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.845
- But what if I was
a published author?

21:19.880 --> 21:22.848
Or what if I were in command
of an army like Joan of Arc?

21:22.883 --> 21:25.517
Or if I became an explorer
and discovered new lands?

21:25.552 --> 21:27.919
I don't need school
for any of those things.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.588
Why aren't you answering
my question?

21:32.225 --> 21:34.025
- My brother's apprentice
as a blacksmith.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.195
The other learns
to become a butcher.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.598
I could be a smithy, I suppose.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.733
- But what do you want, Jerry?!

21:41.768 --> 21:44.870
You could be a cartographer
or an aviator.

21:44.905 --> 21:46.972
You could even lead a safari!

21:47.007 --> 21:49.307
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.343
- Come on, Jerry,
use your imagination!

21:51.378 --> 21:53.712
- No, seriously, I don't know
any of those words.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.380
- Oh.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.282
Well, you get the idea.

21:57.317 --> 22:02.654
And I'm not sure about you, but suddenly I
feel absolutely ablaze with possibility!

22:02.689 --> 22:05.724
- Or you could just go
to school. Because you can.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.828
- Go find something else to do.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.734
(squawking)

22:17.671 --> 22:19.571
(door opening)

22:21.241 --> 22:22.741
- Hello?

22:26.079 --> 22:27.579
Marilla?

22:32.085 --> 22:33.752
What are you doing?

22:37.791 --> 22:40.125
You know the stove's gone cold?

22:42.796 --> 22:44.763
My, my.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.798
This is unlike you.

22:49.302 --> 22:51.970
- I have no idea
what's "like me."

22:52.973 --> 22:54.640
None at all.

22:57.978 --> 22:59.811
I'll light the stove.

23:13.793 --> 23:17.429
- I, uh... I suppose your mind
is burdened, then,

23:17.464 --> 23:19.097
by the minister's visit.

23:19.132 --> 23:22.267
- Oh, everything
is just peaches and cream,

23:22.302 --> 23:23.969
thank you for asking.

23:25.138 --> 23:28.406
Now, is there anything
I can... bake or clean,

23:28.441 --> 23:30.475
or mend or fetch for you?!

23:37.717 --> 23:40.652
(crickets chirring)
(owl hooting)

23:43.523 --> 23:45.524
(bells ringing)

24:08.415 --> 24:10.649
- Marilla? Marilla!!

24:11.651 --> 24:13.618
What's happening?

24:13.653 --> 24:15.287
- There's a fire in town.

24:15.322 --> 24:18.257
Pull on your boots
and hurry down.

24:20.060 --> 24:21.860
(horse snorting)

24:26.032 --> 24:27.832
Fetch the cellar buckets.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.369
We'll slop the pigs
on our way.

24:31.371 --> 24:33.038
Quick like a bunny.

24:35.408 --> 24:37.809
Quick, quick!

24:37.844 --> 24:40.579
Fetch every bucket you can find.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.749
Hold them still
with the blankets.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.485
(horse neighing)

24:47.554 --> 24:49.554
Bring the lantern.
(neighing)

24:53.059 --> 24:56.261
- Keep those buckets comin'! Keep them
movin'. - Pass these down the line!

24:56.296 --> 24:58.229
- Hurry, hurry!

24:58.264 --> 24:59.865
- We need more buckets!

25:03.870 --> 25:05.670
- This is the Gillis's house.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.539
- Oh, poor Ruby.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.542
(people shouting)

25:16.182 --> 25:17.816
(neighing)
- Bring the ladder! Hurry up!

25:17.851 --> 25:20.152
- Hurry, hurry!
(people shouting)

25:22.422 --> 25:25.523
- Get the horses out of here.
(people shouting)

25:25.558 --> 25:29.160
(neighing) - Run to our place
and get some more buckets!

25:29.195 --> 25:31.396
(shouting)

25:31.431 --> 25:32.998
- Anne!

25:33.933 --> 25:35.434
Anne!

25:36.770 --> 25:38.870
- Oh, I've missed you so much!

25:38.905 --> 25:40.839
(windows shattering)
(people screaming)

25:40.874 --> 25:44.009
(man): Stay clear, stay clear!
Give us a hand with the ladder!

25:45.278 --> 25:48.213
- Coming up, coming up!
- Hurry, hurry!

25:48.248 --> 25:50.215
- Get the buckets for Gilbert!

25:50.250 --> 25:52.584
- Oh, no!
(neighing)

25:52.619 --> 25:55.920
- Where's the fire wagon?!
- Boys, let's go, let's go!

25:55.955 --> 25:57.622
- It's on its way!

25:58.792 --> 26:01.159
- It's burning so fierce.
Is everyone out of the house?

26:01.194 --> 26:04.262
- Yeah. That's the Gillis family
over there. You see Ruby?

26:04.297 --> 26:06.765
(man): Hey,
keep the water coming! Come on!

26:06.800 --> 26:09.267
- Why are the doors
and windows open?

26:09.302 --> 26:12.137
(man): We need more water!
(woman): Watch out!

26:12.172 --> 26:14.305
(man): Make way, make way!
- What?

26:14.340 --> 26:16.141
(bells ringing)
- The fire wagon!

26:16.176 --> 26:18.443
- Get back! Fire wagon!
Get back!

26:20.447 --> 26:22.981
- Come on, let's go!
- Anne?

26:24.284 --> 26:27.852
- Get back, get back!
- No! Anne!

26:27.887 --> 26:29.788
Anne!

26:31.658 --> 26:33.625
Anne! Anne!

26:33.660 --> 26:35.493
Anne!

26:35.528 --> 26:37.162
(coughing)

26:39.332 --> 26:40.832
(panting)

26:48.741 --> 26:50.509
(coughing)

26:55.849 --> 26:57.715
- Anne!

26:57.750 --> 26:59.384
(coughing)

26:59.419 --> 27:00.952
(Diana): Anne!!!

27:00.987 --> 27:02.887
- What is it? What's wrong?

27:02.922 --> 27:05.623
- It's Anne!
- What's happened to Anne? Anne!

27:05.658 --> 27:07.525
- She ran inside!
- Let me go!

27:07.560 --> 27:09.427
- No!
- I need to get Anne!

27:09.462 --> 27:11.830
(coughing)
(fire crackling)

27:13.466 --> 27:14.966
- Anne!
- No!

27:15.001 --> 27:17.101
- No, let me go!
I need to get Anne!

27:17.136 --> 27:19.604
- Stay here! - There's Anne!
- Is that her?

27:19.639 --> 27:22.106
Oh, my God.
- Alright, it's slowing down!

27:22.141 --> 27:24.643
We can do this!
Keep 'em coming!

27:34.787 --> 27:37.422
- Where is she?
I don't understand.

27:37.457 --> 27:40.392
Where is she?
- Dear God in heaven! - Anne!

27:48.067 --> 27:50.569
- Somebody help over here!

27:56.409 --> 27:59.010
- Mr. Cuthbert,
Mr. Cuthbert, help!

27:59.045 --> 28:01.546
(coughing)
(wood creaking)

28:01.581 --> 28:03.615
(man shouting)
- Lift it off.

28:03.650 --> 28:06.184
Other end.
(mumbling)

28:08.588 --> 28:11.189
Quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.925
(horses neighing)
(woman praying)

28:21.401 --> 28:25.436
- Anne! Anne! Anne! Oh, Anne!

28:25.471 --> 28:27.105
- Oh, Anne!
- Oh...!

28:27.140 --> 28:28.740
- Anne!
(moaning)

28:28.775 --> 28:31.576
- Find out what's happened!
- Anne!

28:34.814 --> 28:38.383
Oh, she's alright!
- I'm sorry. I'm alright. - She's alright!

28:39.919 --> 28:42.053
- What were you thinking?!
- Did it help?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.889
- Why ever did you run inside?!
- She ran inside!

28:44.924 --> 28:47.725
- Did it slow it down?
- What were you thinking?

28:47.760 --> 28:50.428
- Fire... fire needs oxygen.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.797
Closing windows and doors
deprives it--

28:52.832 --> 28:56.801
- Oh, my word!
- Anne slowed down the fire!

28:56.836 --> 29:00.138
- However do you know that?
- It was Anne! She did it!

29:03.610 --> 29:05.510
- The Fire Manual
in the orphanage.

29:05.545 --> 29:07.478
There wasn't much else to read.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.648
(coughing)
- Here, here.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.084
Oof.
(laughter)

29:17.323 --> 29:19.090
(coughing)

29:20.460 --> 29:23.795
- And we thank thee, O Lord,
for your mercy.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.966
And of some have compassion
making a difference,

29:28.001 --> 29:31.903
others save with fear,
pulling them out of the fire,

29:31.938 --> 29:35.106
hastening even the garments,
spotted by the flesh,

29:35.141 --> 29:38.076
now unto him that is able
to keep you from falling,

29:38.111 --> 29:40.244
and to present your faultless
before the presence

29:40.279 --> 29:42.447
of his glory with exceeding joy.

29:42.482 --> 29:44.682
- Maybe you could be
a firefighter.

29:44.717 --> 29:47.752
(Minister): ...we thank thee
for watching over us,

29:47.787 --> 29:51.823
and keeping all in our
community safe from harm.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.693
Praise be to God almighty.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.830
- Alright, it's settled.

29:58.865 --> 30:02.667
The Gillis family will be
billeted out to the Barrys,

30:02.702 --> 30:05.370
the Cuthberts and ourselves.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.006
- With all the men
pulling together,

30:08.041 --> 30:10.775
we figure the major repairs
will take about a week.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.343
- Sounds about right.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.812
- Jerry and I will put
things right at Green Gables

30:14.847 --> 30:16.848
and be back as soon as we can.

30:16.883 --> 30:20.151
- As will I. I'll bring as
many hands as I can spare.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.720
- Thank you.

30:23.056 --> 30:24.689
What a thing.

30:24.724 --> 30:26.224
What a thing.

30:26.259 --> 30:29.327
- We'll get it all squared away,
never fear.

30:29.362 --> 30:33.998
- We owe you all a great debt
of thanks, especially dear Anne,

30:34.033 --> 30:37.568
risking your life for us
and taking such quick action.

30:37.603 --> 30:41.039
And, ladies, thank you kindly for
agreeing to take the children.

30:41.074 --> 30:43.274
Especially since school
won't be in session.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.743
You'll have your hands full.

30:45.778 --> 30:48.212
Ruby, come here, please.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.982
- It's no trouble at all.
We're happy to have her.

30:51.017 --> 30:54.085
- Now Anne and Ruby can
get to know each other better.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.320
- What? No.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.356
Mother!
- Ruby?

30:58.391 --> 30:59.991
- I don't want to stay there!

31:00.026 --> 31:01.559
- My, my. Calm yourself.

31:01.594 --> 31:04.862
- Why can't I stay with Diana?!
- That's enough. The plan is set.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.365
- I'll never live it down!
Please don't make me!

31:07.400 --> 31:10.401
- I won't have any more of this.
After the events of this evening,

31:10.436 --> 31:13.905
you should be grateful to have a bed
to sleep in at all. - Hear, hear.

31:13.940 --> 31:17.075
- I apologize. I simply...

31:17.110 --> 31:18.776
(crying)

31:18.811 --> 31:21.946
- It doesn't matter what
the other girls think, Ruby,

31:21.981 --> 31:23.782
it matters what you think.

31:24.784 --> 31:28.453
And I, for one, think Anne
is marvellous and brave.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.625
I'll visit soon, alright?
(sniffling)

31:37.597 --> 31:40.331
- It's alright. Don't worry.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.500
I'm sure no one will think
you're my friend.

31:43.836 --> 31:46.171
- I reckon we should be off.

31:59.352 --> 32:03.521
- Now, I'd like the two of you to
go upstairs to bed for a few hours.

32:03.556 --> 32:05.623
You both need rest
after that terrible night.

32:05.658 --> 32:08.292
- I can help you, Marilla.
I should fetch the eggs.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.962
- You can, but you won't.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.030
Now up to bed
with both of you.

32:13.065 --> 32:16.834
Anne, please see to it
that your guest is comfortable.

32:16.869 --> 32:20.304
- Come along, Ruby.
I have a lovely gable room.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.174
And the cherry tree
is ever so friendly.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.012
(Ruby crying)

32:33.519 --> 32:36.855
My first night here in this
room, I cried as you do now.

32:38.024 --> 32:42.393
Try as I might, there was no hope
for my imagination that cold night.

32:43.396 --> 32:46.197
Princess Cordelia
was nowhere to be found.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.500
- Princess Cordelia?

32:49.735 --> 32:51.536
- Well...

32:51.571 --> 32:54.071
she's a wise
and solitary princess.

32:54.106 --> 32:59.143
She wears dresses
of the finest silk and velvet

32:59.178 --> 33:01.780
with puff sleeves
and ever so many flounces.

33:03.683 --> 33:05.483
One day...

33:05.518 --> 33:07.652
Princess Cordelia arrived

33:07.687 --> 33:10.855
at the most beautiful kingdom
in the world.

33:12.091 --> 33:15.793
She knew not a soul and was
worried no one would like her.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.396
- All my dresses will be ruined
from the smoke!

33:19.732 --> 33:22.567
- You can borrow one of mine.
I have two!

33:27.039 --> 33:29.707
A week really isn't that long

33:29.742 --> 33:32.109
when you plan out
all the things you want to do.

33:32.144 --> 33:36.113
Maybe you could start by imagining
what colour you want your room to be.

33:36.148 --> 33:40.051
I know for a fact that it's good
to have things to look forward to.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.021
I've always been partial
to robin's egg blue.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.691
What colour do you like?

33:46.726 --> 33:49.294
Pink would also be divine.

33:50.963 --> 33:53.264
I never usually think of pink.

33:53.299 --> 33:56.834
Being as I'm so red-headed,
it's out of the question.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.637
But you would look so pretty
in a pink room.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.042
(sighing)
We'll stay busy.

34:05.077 --> 34:07.044
I'm learning to bake.

34:07.079 --> 34:11.048
We can make some biscuits
for the boys while they work.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.217
You can see Gilbert.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.786
Diana thought
he cut quite a heroic figure

34:15.821 --> 34:18.055
putting out the blaze
on your behalf.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.258
- On my behalf.

34:20.293 --> 34:23.127
I hadn't really thought of it
like that.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.930
- I didn't notice, of course.

34:25.965 --> 34:28.232
I am not a Gilbert Blythe fan.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.268
I shall never forgive
his insult,

34:30.303 --> 34:33.471
and I shall never be dissuaded
from my low opinion of him.

34:33.506 --> 34:36.307
- That's a good idea
about the biscuits.

34:37.810 --> 34:40.778
It's a shame
you're not in school anymore.

34:40.813 --> 34:44.148
You seem awful smart
about things.

34:44.984 --> 34:47.352
- It's best for everyone
that I'm not there.

34:54.827 --> 34:57.729
(indistinct chatter)

35:03.536 --> 35:06.004
- Put your backs into it,
boys!

35:09.809 --> 35:12.810
(man): There you go!
How many would you like?

35:16.649 --> 35:19.150
- Afternoon, Minister.
I'm learning to bake.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.718
Care for a scone?

35:20.753 --> 35:23.921
- Well, don't mind if I do.
(chuckling)

35:23.956 --> 35:27.325
This is some heavy work.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.862
- Hey, look, it's the freak
and her new twin sister.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.599
- As long as they bring food,
I don't care if it's Quasimodo.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.201
- Ah!

35:37.236 --> 35:39.470
- Ruby!
(boys laughing)

35:39.505 --> 35:42.573
- That was great!
- Ruby, are you alright?

35:42.608 --> 35:45.509
(crying)
(boys laughing)

35:45.544 --> 35:47.411
Ruby--

35:47.446 --> 35:48.946
- Girls are so useless.

35:48.981 --> 35:51.816
Guess you should've stayed
home in the kitchen, eh?!

35:51.851 --> 35:54.218
- What is wrong with you?!

35:54.253 --> 35:56.120
- Go home and bake cookies!

35:56.155 --> 35:58.522
- Headline: They already did.

35:58.557 --> 36:02.093
- This is Ruby's property,
or did you forget?!

36:02.128 --> 36:05.162
- Why don't you shove off
and leave the men to their work?

36:05.197 --> 36:08.232
- Why don't you give me that hammer
and I'll finish the job myself,

36:08.267 --> 36:10.835
if you're too busy being a bully
to get it done!!

36:10.870 --> 36:12.436
(men laughing)

36:12.471 --> 36:14.605
- Hey, here.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.008
You alright?

36:20.046 --> 36:21.980
There you are.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.816
- Thank you, Gilbert.
- Yeah, of course.

36:25.851 --> 36:29.387
Thanks for, uh, coming by
to help feed the beasts.

36:29.422 --> 36:31.222
- Much obliged.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.656
(Anne): You're welcome.

36:32.691 --> 36:36.360
Matthew, will you please
bring the basket home later?

36:36.395 --> 36:39.263
- I'd better, if I know
what's good for me.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.366
(Gilbert): Um...

36:44.203 --> 36:46.437
- Come on, Ruby,
let's get you home.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.412
You were right, Minister,
honesty is the best policy.

36:54.447 --> 36:56.414
And it's also very satisfying.

36:56.449 --> 36:58.783
- Well, I...
(stammering)

37:01.720 --> 37:04.055
- Gilbert is so chivalrous.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.225
- Well, he's something alright.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.597
- That was, uh,
quite an incident...

37:13.632 --> 37:17.068
up there
at the Gillis house today.

37:17.103 --> 37:20.771
- Nothing beats a redhead for a temper.
- Mm-hmm.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.907
I meant you...

37:22.942 --> 37:25.476
being as brave as you were.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.112
- Oh.

37:28.147 --> 37:29.747
- If you were a boy,

37:29.782 --> 37:32.083
oh, that would've ended up
in fisticuffs.

37:32.118 --> 37:34.351
- I wouldn't have minded.
Billy Andrews is a coward

37:34.386 --> 37:36.420
who deserves a good sock
in the kisser.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.123
I could take him.
- Ooh...

37:39.158 --> 37:42.059
Not if you don't...

37:42.094 --> 37:44.295
protect the nose!

37:44.330 --> 37:47.398
Oh! - Oh!
- Uh-oh! You're pretty good!

37:47.433 --> 37:49.467
You been taking lessons
on the sly?

37:49.502 --> 37:50.968
(laughing)
Oh!

37:51.003 --> 37:53.671
- Just call me the Avonlea Ace!
(grunting)

37:53.706 --> 37:56.640
- You're a natural.
Nose, nose, nose!

37:56.675 --> 37:58.476
- Paw! Paw! Paw!

37:58.511 --> 38:00.144
- Oh, jeez.

38:00.179 --> 38:02.246
- Paw!
- Oh, jeez!

38:04.350 --> 38:08.653
- The inaugural meeting of the Avonlea
Story Club is now in session.

38:08.688 --> 38:10.288
(laughter)
- Oh, Anne,

38:10.323 --> 38:13.258
this is so... so...

38:13.293 --> 38:15.827
- Deliciously secret
and scrumptiously exciting?

38:15.862 --> 38:17.829
- You have such a way
with words!

38:17.864 --> 38:20.665
- I hardly know what you're
saying half the time. (laughter)

38:20.700 --> 38:23.234
- Thank you. Now, before we begin
cultivating our imaginations,

38:23.269 --> 38:25.837
each of us should pick
our nom de plume.

38:25.872 --> 38:28.706
- See? It's happened again.
(laughter)

38:28.741 --> 38:32.310
- A nom de plume is a pen name
for purposes of anonymity.

38:32.345 --> 38:34.612
I shall be writing
under the name

38:34.647 --> 38:36.548
of Rosamond Montmorency.

38:36.583 --> 38:39.017
- Oh, that gives me
such a thrill.

38:39.052 --> 38:42.987
- Once a week, we'll read our
completed stories aloud to each other

38:43.022 --> 38:44.656
and talk them over thoughtfully.

38:46.793 --> 38:49.294
(ducks cackling overhead)

38:53.132 --> 38:54.933
- I can't think of anything!

38:54.968 --> 39:00.371
- Oh, I've got heaps of ideas if you
need a little prompting to start.

39:00.406 --> 39:04.409
How about A Tale of Romance
Most Divine and Tragical?

39:04.444 --> 39:06.545
(chuckling)

39:15.388 --> 39:16.888
(yawning)

39:16.923 --> 39:20.258
- I can't believe I move back
into my house tomorrow.

39:21.961 --> 39:23.862
And school will start again.

39:24.864 --> 39:26.965
- Everything will be made right.

39:30.303 --> 39:32.137
- I'll miss you, Anne.

39:45.985 --> 39:47.652
(door creaking)

40:06.205 --> 40:07.872
(sighing)

40:09.042 --> 40:11.376
(floor creaking)

40:14.614 --> 40:16.681
(door creaking)

40:18.217 --> 40:21.653
- I thought you'd like to know
that Ruby has gone to sleep.

40:23.556 --> 40:25.223
- Well, thank you, Anne.

40:31.931 --> 40:34.365
- It's handy that
she can fall asleep so easily.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.435
She needs her rest seeing as
how she's going home tomorrow

40:37.470 --> 40:39.070
and school will start again
soon.

40:39.105 --> 40:40.605
- Mm-hmm.

40:48.781 --> 40:50.382
- I'm in a quandary.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.559
It worries me,
what the minister said.

41:01.594 --> 41:05.563
Not the not-fibbing part.
He was right about that.

41:05.598 --> 41:09.100
It's the "not going to school
and being a wife" part.

41:11.104 --> 41:14.038
- I've been pondering
about that, too.

41:14.073 --> 41:18.276
His thinking seems
a might old-fashioned to me.

41:21.247 --> 41:23.515
What do you think?

41:24.951 --> 41:27.919
- Well, it doesn't provide
much scope for the imagination,

41:27.954 --> 41:29.554
that's for sure and certain.

41:30.456 --> 41:34.192
- Seems to me
you should decide for yourself

41:34.227 --> 41:37.462
what you want to do... and be,

41:37.497 --> 41:40.265
and set your mind to it.

41:43.002 --> 41:45.069
- Maybe school
wouldn't be so bad

41:45.104 --> 41:47.538
now that I have Diana<i> and</i> Ruby.

41:47.573 --> 41:51.176
- You've got a good
and nimble mind, Anne.

41:52.178 --> 41:54.579
I don't see
why you should limit it.

41:58.184 --> 42:01.286
In my day,
we didn't get to choose.

42:02.789 --> 42:06.257
I think you should make
your own decision.

42:11.230 --> 42:12.997
(birdsong)

42:25.011 --> 42:26.544
(sighing)

42:28.848 --> 42:30.849
- Goodbye, dear Katie.

42:38.558 --> 42:40.525
(children chattering)

42:48.568 --> 42:51.903
- Settle down.
Don't make me ask you again.

42:55.141 --> 42:57.575
Open your readers
to chapter 12.

43:11.991 --> 43:16.361
When I turn around,
you best have your readers open.

43:17.330 --> 43:19.597
- It's Anne! (all gasping)
- Anne!

43:19.632 --> 43:21.599
She's here!
- She's back.

43:21.634 --> 43:23.468
- Anne!
(laughter)

43:24.737 --> 43:26.737
- Missed you so much.
(laughter)

43:26.772 --> 43:29.908
- Anne Shirley-Cuthbert,
take your seat.

44:01.741 --> 44:03.708
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal

44:03.743 --> 44:05.743
(grunting)
- Ah!
