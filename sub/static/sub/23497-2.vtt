00:11.011 --> 00:13.556
- We're gonna be late for class.
- Come and get it.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.098
I don't bite.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.689
-Ow.
-I lied.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.190
I do bite.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.276
This isn't fair, you know. I promised Tiny
I'd make it to math class today.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.445
Shh. Can't we skip?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.948
Hang out, just you and me,
like it was all summer.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.909
-And do what?
-Ooh, use your imagination.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.411
Well, see,
I'm not that creative...

00:36.494 --> 00:38.581
--...so you'll have to help me out.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.752
Okay.
Okay, but where would we go?

00:43.836 --> 00:46.129
When the bell rings,
everyone will be inside.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.800
What? And do it in the school parking lot?
What if someone catches us?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.094
We could do something
a little more discreet.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.101
Right here?
Right now?

01:00.018 --> 01:01.269
Are you serious?

01:01.353 --> 01:03.355
Guess you'll have to skip class
and find out.

01:15.743 --> 01:20.372
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:22.040 --> 01:26.837
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:30.924 --> 01:36.054
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:36.138 --> 01:37.848
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

01:38.807 --> 01:42.560
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

02:15.969 --> 02:18.096
Rise and shine, sweetie.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.349
I don't feel so hot.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.601
You already missed most of week one.
You don't wanna get behind,

02:23.686 --> 02:25.562
especially with university applications
around the corner.

02:27.022 --> 02:30.233
The doctor said you looked okay.
You must be feeling a little better.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.359
A little.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.071
Some fresh air will probably do you good.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.660
I'll rise,
but I can't promise any shining.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.557
Hey, man, could I borrow
that math homework?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.060
-Nope.
-Oh, come on. Look, I'm sorry I ditched.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.480
- But I have a very good excuse.
- There actually was no homework.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.065
'Cause we had a pop quiz.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.860
-Damn it.
-And let me guess.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.738
- You were with her?
- What, Esme?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.489
- Zig, that girl is crazy.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.452
Okay, look... I couldn't say no
to her this morning, all right?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.997
You gotta understand.
There's a whole situation.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.916
Yeah, but it's not like you two
haven't had all the sex.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.794
- Yeah, but, uh...
- never at school.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.295
You did it at school?

03:32.379 --> 03:33.797
--What?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.258
- Really?
- Not "it" it. Okay?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.969
So she went down on you.
Classy.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.471
- Ew. Where?

03:43.556 --> 03:45.683
- In the school parking lot.
- What?

03:45.768 --> 03:46.769
Easy, okay?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.686
-Did you use protection?
-What? For that?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.314
You can still get STIs,
I'm pretty sure.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.859
- What kind of girl even does that?
- In public?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.485
Damaged girls.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.529
Okay, guys. Come on.
She's not that bad, all right?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.364
She just... really likes me.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.785
Yeah, but how many other dudes
has she liked in that parking lot?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.787
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.289
Do you guys really think it's that bad?

04:07.372 --> 04:10.042
I really think
she's gonna make you flunk senior year.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.920
It's not like you're serious
about her anyway, right?

04:13.003 --> 04:15.588
Do you think Armstrong
will let me do a make-up test?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.382
Maybe if you ask nicely.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.134
But... not Esme nicely.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.475
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.771
We need to shift the business model
for our entire vlog channel.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.564
We've retained most of Vijay's fans
from his old channel,

04:32.647 --> 04:34.482
but we've hit a wall with new subscribers.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.777
So what do we do?
Buy some AdWords?

04:36.860 --> 04:40.238
-Actually, it's a simpler problem.
-Our audience is 90% male.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.075
But the whole point
of All-Inclusive is to create

04:43.158 --> 04:45.077
a safe-space channel
that's welcoming to everyone.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.662
Obviously, our current content
just isn't that attractive to women.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.873
No. Girls want gaming videos, too.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.584
Maybe, but we have to find some way
to bring them to our channel first.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.419
What would get them to the channel?

04:54.502 --> 04:57.464
The top categories for girls are fashion,
make-up tutorials, nail art...

04:57.547 --> 04:59.174
Have fun with that.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.093
Actually, it has to be you.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.181
No. We agreed on this.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.309
Okay. Hunter reviews comics,
Vijay does song covers,

05:09.392 --> 05:11.144
you get movies, and I do games.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.230
We have to give the girls
someone to identify with.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.942
I don't know the first thing
about these subjects, okay?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.819
Which is why I hired a consultant.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.544
-It's rad. Is that a heart monitor?
-Yeah.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.922
And, uh, the crash sounds,
they're actually real, too.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.883
We smashed some stuff together
and recorded it.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.175
It's about the bus crash?

05:42.259 --> 05:44.844
Yeah, and, uh,
how do you move on from a tragedy?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.638
Or, at least,
it will be once you add lyrics.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.016
Yeah, and that stuff
that Miles said in class

05:49.099 --> 05:50.642
actually kind of inspired it.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.311
We're sort of thinking of making,
like, a whole rock opera.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.437
Wow.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.481
Well,
hope you're feeling better, Maya.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.567
If not, I have a surefire cure.
Take two and call me in the morning.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.156
Uh, actually, you do have to do all of it.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.243
Still... fun, right?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.830
- So, do you have anything?
- Besides all of last week's homework?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.582
Uh, lyrics.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.584
Oh!
Do you mean, like, right now?

06:16.668 --> 06:18.711
Yeah. Uh, you know,
'cause we wanna finalize it

06:18.795 --> 06:20.172
so we can move on to the next one.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.090
And you're always so fast with this stuff.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.967
Sure, I'll come up with something.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.803
Great. We've got the music room
booked after school to jam.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.184
This year, we're making
Degrassi a safe space for everyone.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.561
For more information,
follow the Degrassi community page...

06:38.190 --> 06:40.275
Whoa. Whoa.
Don't sneak up on me like that.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.484
Easy, jumpy.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.486
Figured you'd be all relaxed
from this morning.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.779
Yeah, um...

06:44.862 --> 06:47.657
Look, have you ever done that before?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.867
Did I seem out of practice?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.912
Damn. Okay.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.747
Um, well,
we could skip lunch and try again.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.419
I actually have a thing.

06:59.502 --> 07:03.381
Armstrong is letting me do a make-up quiz,
so I kinda have to study.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.550
Why didn't you say so?
Let's study.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.303
I just thought
it was more of, like, a solo mission.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.721
Okay, what gives?

07:10.472 --> 07:14.767
Tiny just thinks I should focus more
on school stuff and not so much on--

07:14.851 --> 07:16.019
Me?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.855
He's only saying that
'cause he's with that prude Shay.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.609
Look, when we're together,
you have to admit we do tend to get...

07:22.692 --> 07:24.027
distracted.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.612
I'm really good at math.
Seriously.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.408
Let me help.
I promise, no sexy stuff.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.369
No matter how much you beg.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.288
Okay.
We're gonna raise your cheekbones,

07:35.372 --> 07:37.582
erase these circles,
and hide these imperfections

07:37.665 --> 07:39.417
-here, here and here--
-Imperfections?

07:40.585 --> 07:43.796
Then, we're gonna sharpen your brow,
overdraw your lips and cinch your waist--

07:43.880 --> 07:46.049
- Whoa.
- I said natural.

07:46.133 --> 07:50.262
Yeah. This is what it's gonna take
to get a nice, natural look.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.974
Is this really going to make me
more appealing to girls?

07:54.057 --> 07:56.309
Yep. And guys, too.
Big time.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.313
- Looks like I'm wearing a... a mask.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.814
Yeah, a mask that says,

08:01.898 --> 08:04.151
"I put in a little effort today,
so come hang out."

08:04.234 --> 08:07.029
Why wouldn't people
just wanna hang out with me for me?

08:07.112 --> 08:10.823
Um, I don't know, but don't you want to do
what's best for the show?

08:47.569 --> 08:49.487
These things can be pretty slippery.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.658
- Are you okay?
- Definitely not.

08:54.284 --> 08:58.080
Well, do you maybe wanna talk to somebody?

08:58.163 --> 09:00.498
JK. LOL.
I'll be fine.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.630
And which one is the hypotenuse?

09:09.382 --> 09:12.969
Oh, you're not just a pretty face.
Now, find me the value of cosine.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.517
Are you serious right now?

09:20.935 --> 09:21.936
Phone.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.856
Okay.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.650
Cosine. Go.

09:27.734 --> 09:31.488
See, I can never understand
what to do to find each one.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.906
Oscar Had A Handful Of Apples.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.867
- Okay. Good for Oscar. Who's Oscar?

09:35.950 --> 09:41.581
Oscar, opposite. Had, hypotenuse.
A, adjacent. Handful, hypotenuse...

09:42.249 --> 09:44.417
Of, opposite.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.627
Apples, adjacent?

09:46.211 --> 09:47.295
Precisely.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.172
Okay. So, then...

09:51.048 --> 09:54.761
Cosine is, uh...

09:57.430 --> 09:59.849
Okay. Uh, value.
Blah, blah. Blah.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.604
Six?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.982
Zero point six.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.029
Esme?

10:15.073 --> 10:16.616
What the hell?

10:18.826 --> 10:20.495
Yael, you ready?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.668
Don't tell me you like this.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.795
I don't dislike it.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.464
Okay. Let's just start.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.844
--Okay. Leave room for the title card.

10:38.721 --> 10:42.892
Hey, team. Welcome to
the All-Inclusive News and Reviews vlog.

10:42.975 --> 10:47.814
Today we are switching gears
from games to glam, with some nail art.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.693
Um, have you ever wanted
little galaxies on your pinkies?

10:51.776 --> 10:53.486
If so, here's how.

10:53.570 --> 10:57.740
Um, so start with a... a black coat,
which I've already done.

10:57.824 --> 11:02.412
And then, um,
take some sponge and some indigo.

11:02.495 --> 11:08.543
Uh, apply the blue to small sections
of each of your nails.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.170
Just like this.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.797
No, no, no.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.924
-Oh. Should we cut and start again?
-No, this is so dumb.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.302
You know what? The world
is not gonna be saved by nail art.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.262
Yeah,
but girls seem to like it.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.266
So? Who cares?
I mean, I can barely breathe,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.935
mascara is dripping into my eyes,
and for what?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.521
To make our YouTube channel successful?

11:28.605 --> 11:30.064
Okay.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.899
You know why girls can't get ahead?

11:31.983 --> 11:35.778
Because they spend upwards of,
like, two hours every day doing this.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.155
Okay? That's, like, one-tenth
of their waking life.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.783
I mean, who cares about nail polish?
Or make-up? Or...

11:40.867 --> 11:42.494
It's all so stupid.
And you know what?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.871
Girls who care about this are stupid, too.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.039
Esme, where did you go?
Why did you take my phone?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.292
"Why," indeed.
Let's check out your group texts.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.879
Jonah. "Make sure you get her
the jumbo Slurpee 'cause she's thirsty."

11:52.962 --> 11:56.674
Tiny. "Are we studying or hanging out
with Easy Esme again?"

11:56.758 --> 11:58.175
Hey, I didn't write that stuff.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.677
Yeah, but you wrote this one.

11:59.761 --> 12:03.890
"As long as I don't wife her, what's wrong
with some extra third base action?"

12:03.973 --> 12:05.350
Those are just jokes.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.851
About me!

12:06.934 --> 12:09.103
You're the one
who's always doing crazy stuff.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.647
What is your issue?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.400
Sometimes you do things
other girls wouldn't do.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.410
You calling me a slut?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.079
Okay, then...
Who's next?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.165
- Oh, my God. Should we put a stop to this?
- No, no.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.125
-Esme, what are you doing?
-I'm crazy old Easy E,

12:31.208 --> 12:34.754
and I'm gonna go out to my car and show
this young man the time of his life.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.465
-Esme, stop.
-Oh, should I do it right here?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.092
- Unconventional, but...
- No...

12:41.010 --> 12:43.805
--What is happening here?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.766
That's a good question.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.356
So, still think we were wrong about her?

12:58.152 --> 13:00.738
My door is always open
if you have any more questions.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.701
Maya.
It's nice to see you.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.370
Just give me a minute.
I have to make a quick phone call.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.180
That's mine.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.573
What's up?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.742
I don't know.
It's just...

13:45.825 --> 13:48.285
There's so much stuff, you know?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.537
I'm just feeling...

13:50.204 --> 13:51.456
Feeling stressed.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.709
There's been a lot of that going on here.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.628
Senior year is hard.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.797
I don't know if it's just that.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.634
When we spoke in the spring,
you were concerned about your music,

14:02.717 --> 14:04.552
because you broke your wrists.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.723
I know that you've had anxiety before,

14:08.806 --> 14:12.477
so let's start by making a list
of all this stuff.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.105
So what's on your plate?

14:16.188 --> 14:18.400
Well, there's homework.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.485
So much homework.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.611
Hmm.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.946
University applications.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.990
My mom's always on my case.
Does that count?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.700
Mmm-hmm.

14:27.784 --> 14:32.914
Mmm, text messages I have to return,
my friends leaning on me to do things...

14:35.625 --> 14:36.709
And that's it?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.461
Yeah.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.048
But...

14:43.841 --> 14:46.886
it still feels like...

14:47.887 --> 14:51.391
I'm being... pulled underwater...

14:52.684 --> 14:55.102
with no way to get to the surface.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.363
I know it can seem hard.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.159
But look at this list.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.495
It's not that big.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.457
And there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.208
University.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.251
Here.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.546
Berklee...

15:21.629 --> 15:23.756
SoCalArt...

15:23.840 --> 15:25.382
those are the programs we've talked about.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.928
Start the application process.

15:29.011 --> 15:33.516
Everything that you check off that list
will bring you closer to the surface.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.851
I promise.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.769
You know why girls can't get ahead?

15:36.853 --> 15:39.981
Because they spend upwards of,
like, two hours every day doing this.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.734
Okay? That's like one-tenth
of their waking life...

15:42.817 --> 15:46.153
I still can't believe you posted this rant
without consulting us.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.449
Why not? Viewers on that vlog
are split evenly by gender.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.200
But have you seen the comments?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.995
Idiots always flame the comments section.
You know that.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.456
Oh, God.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.958
Hey, could I borrow a pen?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.503
Aren't you worried I might
accidentally pass you a banana?

16:05.089 --> 16:06.883
Because I'm too stupid
to know the difference?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.762
-You watched the vlog.
-You betrayed womankind.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.473
I was defending womankind
from unfair beauty standards.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.601
It seemed like you were saying
women who wear makeup are idiots.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.978
Just the ones who put
too much time into it.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.980
What's wrong with spending
a little time on yourself?

16:21.063 --> 16:24.275
- It's the patriarchy oppressing you.
- I don't do it for boys.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.152
I do it for myself.
It makes me feel good.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.988
No, you do it because you like
how boys look at you when you wear it.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.365
Actually, I'd prefer they didn't.
I have a boyfriend.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.952
- So you'd do at home? Alone?
- Yeah, I do it all the time.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.579
If it makes me feel good,
then what's the problem?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.498
Because girls like you
are ruining it for the rest of us.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.752
The comments section idiots
might have a point this time.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.463
I think we need to call
another emergency meeting.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.592
--And, no, I don't have a pen either.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.941
Hey, Maya.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.656
Do I make crappy decisions?

17:12.323 --> 17:13.658
Are you talking about Esme?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.744
I mean, the summer was great.

17:17.829 --> 17:18.996
Sounds nice.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.293
Then when we got back to school,
everyone started weighing in.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.630
So why do you care what your friends say?

17:27.714 --> 17:28.923
Well, they're not wrong.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.467
She's messed up.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.885
Who isn't?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.431
If you like her,
don't let the chorus of idiots

17:37.514 --> 17:40.643
trying to shame women's actions
stop you from being happy.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.021
-Thanks, Maya.
-Yeah.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.858
We've been waiting for you for 40 minutes.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.110
- I'm so sorry. I forgot.
- It's... it's okay.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.820
- All right? We just need the lyrics.
- I'm sorry.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.365
It's just between school,
university stuff, and then... And this...

17:54.448 --> 17:57.744
I don't know how to do it all.
I just don't know if it's even possible.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.871
You're not alone.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.122
Yeah, I mean...

18:02.039 --> 18:04.166
You know, I mean, I've got
a stack of university brochures

18:04.250 --> 18:07.211
that are... this high at home.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.380
Uh, why don't you just take tonight off,

18:09.463 --> 18:12.216
get your school stuff sorted out,
and we can jam tomorrow?

18:12.299 --> 18:14.093
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.264
Esme!
Esme, wait up.

18:19.390 --> 18:22.184
-I have a gift for you.
-Is it a Tiffany choker?

18:23.227 --> 18:24.854
Eighty-two.
Whoop-dee-doo.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.107
Hey, this is the best I've ever done.
Totally thanks to you.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.192
- Esme, I'm sorry.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.568
Okay? I... I messed up.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.404
I should have never let anyone
say those things about you.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.615
I don't care what anyone says about me.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.785
Your opinion was the only one
that mattered.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.454
Esme, I think the world of you.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.791
What happens when people
start saying other stuff?

18:44.874 --> 18:47.001
Darker stuff?
Stuff that might be true?

18:48.169 --> 18:51.005
-You freak out and bail then, too?
-Like what?

18:52.757 --> 18:55.718
Did you know I've been
in and out of therapy my entire life?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.261
-Nothing wrong with that.
-Because when I was ten,

18:57.344 --> 18:59.346
my mom killed herself and I found her.

19:00.347 --> 19:03.768
And maybe I took too long to call 911
or I shook her the wrong way.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.020
But after a few weeks in the hospital,
she died.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.482
Look, Esme,
I'm sure that wasn't your fault.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.568
Dad still kinda blames me.

19:14.946 --> 19:18.115
Is that why you reacted
to those hospital pictures of Tristan?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.536
Guess that brought me back, yeah.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.376
Look, I know it's not the same thing,
but...

19:30.377 --> 19:33.589
My parents blame me
for stuff, too.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.841
Like what?

19:38.970 --> 19:41.347
Like, my mom kicked me out...

19:42.264 --> 19:43.975
for selling drugs...

19:45.059 --> 19:48.062
hanging with guys who had guns,
endangering my little brother.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.900
I'm on probation for another year,
and I live in a group home.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.363
And I guess since I don't have a family,

19:57.446 --> 20:00.074
I listen to my friends
a little bit too much.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.829
You have me.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.678
Let's call the meeting to order.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.349
Great. I'm not gonna do
that kind of vlog anymore.

20:27.184 --> 20:31.355
You have to. It's the kind of content
today's teens are craving.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.025
What we can't have any more
of is this kind of negative feedback.

20:34.108 --> 20:37.028
Yeah. The whole idea for this vlog
is to be all-inclusive,

20:37.111 --> 20:39.238
and honestly,
viewers are feeling very attacked.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.407
If we're trying to reform
our image from last year,

20:41.490 --> 20:43.159
we can't engage in these debates.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.285
They're divisive.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.913
So what? We're gonna make Yael
do a vlog that isn't the real her?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.540
I thought you liked that other me.

20:51.042 --> 20:55.797
I was just surprised. But, um...
I like you better when you're yourself.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.050
I'm glad you said that, actually.

20:59.133 --> 21:03.720
Um, we all know that authenticity
is the key to engagement.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.933
And I've come to realize that there's
more than just one kind of girl,

21:07.016 --> 21:09.393
and I'm just not that kind.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.271
But you know who is?

21:14.731 --> 21:20.822
What if I do the gaming videos
and Lola does the make-up, fashiony stuff?

21:24.325 --> 21:27.161
I mean, I know this complicates things,
but I just thought it was--

21:27.244 --> 21:28.620
All those in favor?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.291
--I'll draw up the contracts.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.043
Can I help design your backdrop?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.503
I'm so glad that worked.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.423
So, what game should I review next?

21:40.507 --> 21:41.758
Uh, I don't know.

21:41.843 --> 21:45.512
But I should, um, probably give her
a camera tutorial, right?

21:47.264 --> 21:49.475
Yeah, okay.

21:50.184 --> 21:53.062
- It's like The Matrix blue-or-red thing.
