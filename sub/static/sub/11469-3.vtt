helps him win the election.

38:00.984 --> 38:04.255
O'shea's elected mayor,
Irving never makes chief.
Mm-hmm.

38:04.355 --> 38:07.558
Never knew you had
such a nose for politics, Jerry.

38:07.658 --> 38:09.260
Fuck you, Harry.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.996
[ Chuckles ]

38:13.165 --> 38:15.768
Your full name, birth date,
and place of birth?

38:15.868 --> 38:18.772
Raynard waits.
No middle name.

38:18.872 --> 38:22.776
Born November 3, 1971,
in the city of angels.

38:22.876 --> 38:24.110
You mean Los Angeles.

38:25.813 --> 38:27.514
Los Angeles.

38:27.614 --> 38:32.087
You know, detective bosch,
you and I met before, years ago.

38:32.187 --> 38:33.054
I doubt that.

38:33.154 --> 38:34.856
Yeah. You --
you were a patrolman.

38:34.956 --> 38:39.060
And you gave me a ticket.
I-i was making a right turn,

38:39.160 --> 38:42.031
and -- and I rolled
the stop sign.

38:42.131 --> 38:44.666
Y-you didn't know it,
but...

38:44.801 --> 38:47.805
I had a body in the Van
that day, too.

38:47.871 --> 38:51.241
It was a close call.

38:51.341 --> 38:56.815
But you did teach me
a valuable lesson --

38:56.881 --> 38:59.417
mind the little things.

38:59.517 --> 39:00.985
Your attorney's proffer

39:01.086 --> 39:03.823
suggests the first homicide
you committed

39:03.889 --> 39:06.225
was Arthur delacroix
in may of '94.

39:06.325 --> 39:08.694
Yeah. I didn't know
his name at the time,

39:08.829 --> 39:10.063
but, yes, he was my first.

39:10.163 --> 39:12.265
Well, you never forget
your first.

39:12.365 --> 39:13.834
Know what I mean?

39:17.204 --> 39:19.173
Edgar: Hmph.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.108
Why doesn't he let you
ask any questions?

39:21.208 --> 39:22.543
A-are you just
the sidekick?

39:22.643 --> 39:24.146
Fuck off.

39:24.246 --> 39:26.849
Tell us about the day
you killed Arthur delacroix.

39:26.915 --> 39:28.616
Well, i-i saw him
on the street.

39:28.716 --> 39:30.719
I was driving down
Hollywood boulevard.

39:30.854 --> 39:33.122
It's -- it's changed a lot
since then, Hollywood.

39:33.222 --> 39:35.524
They -- they hadn't built
the Kodak theater yet

39:35.624 --> 39:38.328
or fucked up
grauman's Chinese --
had you seen him before?

39:38.428 --> 39:40.998
Detective bosch...

39:41.098 --> 39:43.533
I just want to say
i really admire you.

39:43.633 --> 39:47.505
Please, just answer
the questions, Mr. waits.
No, no, I do.

39:47.605 --> 39:49.640
You know, for you
to rise above

39:49.740 --> 39:51.943
the circumstances
of your childhood

39:52.044 --> 39:54.881
and become a police officer,
i mean, that's --

39:54.914 --> 39:56.883
that's a real achievement.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.089
I like to think
I've done the same.

40:02.189 --> 40:04.524
Why'd you pick
Arthur delacroix?

40:05.893 --> 40:08.396
Um, well...

40:08.496 --> 40:10.131
He was smaller

40:10.231 --> 40:13.234
than the rest of the kids that
were hanging out on that corner,

40:13.334 --> 40:16.205
and, uh, he seemed like he
wouldn't be that hard to manage.

40:16.305 --> 40:19.574
I told him
i would take him to the movies.

40:19.674 --> 40:21.111
He got in the Van.

40:21.211 --> 40:24.247
I doubt that would happen
these days.

40:24.347 --> 40:27.283
Kids today
are a lot more cautious.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.321
What happened
after you got him in the Van?

40:32.189 --> 40:33.925
I took him
to my special place.

40:34.025 --> 40:36.962
Your special place.
Where's that?

40:37.062 --> 40:39.297
East L.A., down by
the Los Angeles river.

40:39.397 --> 40:42.367
I took them all there.
First there, then up the canyon.

40:42.467 --> 40:44.637
What makes it "special"?

40:44.737 --> 40:47.373
Oh, he speaks.

40:47.473 --> 40:50.710
I can't explain it.

40:50.810 --> 40:54.214
You -- you have to see it
to understand.

40:54.314 --> 40:58.353
And after that, what happened
at your "special place"?

41:00.321 --> 41:01.489
I killed him.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.091
Did you rape him?
No.

41:03.191 --> 41:05.094
I'm not a pedophile.
How'd you kill him?

41:05.962 --> 41:08.164
I strangled him.

41:12.869 --> 41:14.737
No.

41:14.837 --> 41:16.373
I'm sorry.

41:16.473 --> 41:23.014
That was later,
after I perfected my approach.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.882
Yeah.
It was a long time ago.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.618
I thought
you never forget your first.

41:27.987 --> 41:29.588
It'll come to me.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.290
And after you killed him?

41:31.390 --> 41:33.458
Well, I took the body,
put it in my Van,

41:33.558 --> 41:35.895
drove up to Laurel canyon,
and I buried it.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.998
Oh, I'm taking you
up there, right?

41:38.031 --> 41:40.800
The way this is going,
I'd say no.
Aw.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.336
Why?

41:42.436 --> 41:44.205
Why not?
I-I'm trying to be helpful.

41:44.305 --> 41:46.740
The detectives need
specific details, Mr. waits.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.410
Oh, uh,
ask something specific.

41:48.510 --> 41:50.645
Arthur delacroix
had a yo-yo with him.

41:50.745 --> 41:51.679
What color was it?

41:51.779 --> 41:53.581
A yo-yo?

41:53.681 --> 41:55.250
Yeah.
What color was it?

41:57.486 --> 42:00.123
Mm...

42:00.223 --> 42:02.191
I don't remember.
You don't remember
the yo-yo,

42:02.291 --> 42:03.927
or you don't remember
what color it was?

42:04.028 --> 42:07.364
I'm sorry.
I-i-i don't remember the yo-yo.

42:07.464 --> 42:09.099
You didn't kill
Arthur delacroix.

42:10.901 --> 42:12.070
Yes, I did.

42:12.170 --> 42:13.738
But you just
don't remember how?

42:20.212 --> 42:22.414
I'm too old a cat
to be fucked by a kitten.

42:32.693 --> 42:34.495
That's my number.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.664
You think of something
that wasn't in the papers,

42:36.764 --> 42:38.166
you give me a call.

42:39.067 --> 42:41.936
I do remember one thing.

42:42.071 --> 42:45.474
He had a starfish...
In his backpack.

42:45.574 --> 42:50.580
A plastic starfish,
like a souvenir, you know?

43:03.928 --> 43:05.563
Shit.

43:07.565 --> 43:08.901
You got a smoke?

43:09.001 --> 43:10.736
Yeah.

43:10.836 --> 43:12.105
Here you go.

43:12.171 --> 43:14.473
Thanks.
Yep.

43:16.476 --> 43:19.246
Harry, that story,
you giving him a ticket --

43:19.346 --> 43:21.115
think it's true?
Shit.

43:21.181 --> 43:24.152
I haven't been in
a black-and-white in 22 years.

43:24.252 --> 43:26.187
Nothing out of that shitbird's
mouth is true,

43:26.287 --> 43:27.422
including his name.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.290
He confessed
to, what, eight so far?

43:29.390 --> 43:31.993
We'll never know
how many others he's done.

43:32.128 --> 43:33.795
You can profile
these serial motherfuckers

43:33.895 --> 43:35.331
till kingdom come --

43:35.431 --> 43:36.698
you're never gonna
get inside their heads.

43:36.798 --> 43:37.934
Crazy's crazy.

43:38.034 --> 43:41.671
I don't disagree.

43:41.771 --> 43:45.143
He knew about the starfish.

43:45.243 --> 43:47.745
That, I can't figure.

43:47.845 --> 43:49.547
You asked waits for proof.

43:49.647 --> 43:53.017
He gave it to you.
Smoking gun, man.

43:53.152 --> 43:54.553
I don't buy it.

43:54.653 --> 43:57.489
I don't know his angle,
but I'm not buying it.

43:57.589 --> 44:00.426
He didn't kill
that delacroix child.

44:00.526 --> 44:02.162
Okay.

44:02.262 --> 44:04.430
But what if he did?
