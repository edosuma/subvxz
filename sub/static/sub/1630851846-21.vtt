WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:06.484
Thanks again for having us
over, guys.

00:06.528 --> 00:09.661
Your home is beautiful!
They could shoot pornos here!

00:09.705 --> 00:11.141
They have.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.622
This B-B-Q
is the least we can do.

00:13.665 --> 00:16.190
Your son defended Toshi's honor
at school!

00:16.233 --> 00:18.061
Oh, it was nothing.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.759
Anyone could've helped him
vandalize that lunch lady's car.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.593
Oh! Oh, Toshi,
one of these days,

00:28.637 --> 00:30.943
you'll have to
teach me Japanese.

00:30.987 --> 00:33.816
Hideki, my man, I gotta say
I'm lovin' it here!

00:33.859 --> 00:36.906
Your house is gigantic,
your pool is dangerously deep,

00:36.949 --> 00:38.951
and I like how you're wearing
dress shoes and socks

00:38.995 --> 00:40.779
with your Speedo.
Powerful look.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.955
Gonna run
to the bathroom.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.262
So you know, this is
a massive sign of respect.

00:45.306 --> 00:48.091
I usually just go in the pool,
even at home.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.138
Especially at home.
When I'm not swimming.

00:53.444 --> 00:56.621
Where's the bathroom?
They have to dump somewhere.

00:56.665 --> 01:00.669
Unless I was <i>supposed
to go in the pool.</i>

01:00.712 --> 01:03.063
Hideki's got
an archery range?!

01:03.106 --> 01:04.977
Stan, are you
pooping or snooping?

01:05.021 --> 01:06.979
- I would, too.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.634
We have a lot
of great stuff!

01:09.678 --> 01:12.594
That's our
weekend kitchen...

01:12.637 --> 01:16.119
This room's just an insanely
soft rug to stand barefoot on

01:16.163 --> 01:18.600
while you listen
to the Indigo Girls.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.169
And Triangle Room.

01:22.212 --> 01:26.129
But you have
a triangular room.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.392
Why didn't you put
your triangles in there?

01:31.178 --> 01:34.181
Oh, Stan!

01:34.224 --> 01:36.922
You have truly
created comedy.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.576
Thank you.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.796
You know, a lot of people
don't get my comedy.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.059
For instance,
me right now.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.456
♪ <i>Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ♪

01:48.499 --> 01:52.329

Aah!

02:09.738 --> 02:12.958
♪ <i>Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ♪

02:17.006 --> 02:19.008
Damn,
someone's blowing up.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.880
Uh, think that's you,
Jeff.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.056
"Yo, doggy,
wanna join me

02:24.100 --> 02:27.059
for a one-on-one guys' weekend
out in the country?

02:27.103 --> 02:30.150
Peace, love, and titties,
Klaus."

02:30.193 --> 02:31.760
Um...

02:31.803 --> 02:34.502
Why don't <i>we</i> have a house
like Hideki's?!

02:34.545 --> 02:36.417
This place sucks
compared to theirs!

02:36.460 --> 02:38.462
I think it's perfect here,
Dad!

02:38.506 --> 02:40.464
I'm just grateful
for everything we have.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.292
Then you're a fool, Steve.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.965
I don't even wanna think
about what Hideki

02:43.989 --> 02:45.034
would say
about this dump.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.862
Well, you're gonna
find out.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.299
I invited him over for dinner
this weekend.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.736
You did what?!
Hideki can't come here.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.391
He'll think I'm a loser!
Aah!

02:54.435 --> 02:57.089
And look at this wall!
This place is falling apart!

02:57.133 --> 02:58.439
How could you
do this to me?!

03:00.702 --> 03:03.400
Mother, which day
are the Yoshidas coming?

03:03.444 --> 03:06.229
You see, traditionally,
I take a Sunday stroll, and I...

03:06.273 --> 03:09.841
We all know about
your precious Sunday strolls.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.582
Don't worry.
It's Saturday.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.105
Y-e-es!

03:19.286 --> 03:21.244
I'm sorry we got
interrupted by...

03:21.288 --> 03:23.464
whatever all that was.

03:23.507 --> 03:26.858
Think over my offer, Jeff.
I'll be in my alcove.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.339
I think you know
where it is.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.041
I don't know what to do,
babe.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.652
Things tend to get weird
when I hang out

03:37.695 --> 03:39.958
with Mr. Klaus
unsupervised.

03:40.002 --> 03:43.092
But it'll be really weird
if you tell him you can't go.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.963
He knows you have
nothing going on.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.096
- Everyone knows.
- They do?

03:47.139 --> 03:50.142
That's...
flattering!

03:52.623 --> 03:54.930
I'm so screwed!

03:54.973 --> 03:56.975
Hideki's like the coolest guy
I know.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.847
I can't entertain him
in this shitbox!

03:58.890 --> 04:02.329
But this is an easy fix.
Just go buy some new stuff.

04:02.372 --> 04:05.157
With what money? I'm barely
keeping my head above water.

04:05.201 --> 04:08.248
No, dummy, not real money.
Throw it on a credit card!

04:08.291 --> 04:10.554
That's the beauty of credit.
You buy now, you pay later.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.252
Or maybe never!

04:12.295 --> 04:14.297
I wish I could,
but the credit-card companies

04:14.341 --> 04:17.039
froze me out after I maxed out
12 cards last summer

04:17.082 --> 04:19.476
trying to cut my teeth
on the Funny Car circuit.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.130
Oh.
Well, then, yeah,

04:21.173 --> 04:22.958
Hideki's gonna laugh
at your clown ass.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.613
Thank you! You get it.
No one else does.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.504
I got Steve down there telling
me everything's "perfect"

04:27.528 --> 04:29.138
when it clearly isn't.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.922
- Such a dick.
- Such a dick.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.837
Easy for him to talk.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.362
He's never had to deal with
financial responsibility.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.929
Right? He's never had to
pay off three credit cards

04:37.973 --> 04:40.758
with seven other credit cards.
He's never had one.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.979
Just letting his virgin credit
sit there like a lazy bum.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.937
And it's that dick's fault
you're in this jam.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.461
<i>He's</i> Toshi's friend.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.071
You're right.
Come on.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.160
- We're going to the airport.
- Airport?

04:51.203 --> 04:53.423
Seems odd, but I'm with ya,
Stan.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.296
Think we'll see any luggage
while we're there?

04:57.949 --> 05:00.952
Sorry.
I got held up at security.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.955
That was expensive tea, and I
wasn't just gonna throw it away.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.217
So, why are we here
anyway?

05:05.261 --> 05:07.263
For this.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.352
I thought you couldn't get
credit cards anymore?

05:09.396 --> 05:12.790
I can't. Hi. I'd like to sign up
for a teen credit card.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.880
- My name is Steve Smith.
- Whoa.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.970
Hijacking your son's credit?
Love it!

05:19.014 --> 05:20.755
Hey, did you buy
two boarding passes

05:20.798 --> 05:22.626
just to come get
a credit card here?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.110
You know you can do it online,
right?

05:24.149 --> 05:26.848
You can?
Oh, my God, I'm ruined!

05:29.764 --> 05:31.418
This is working great!

05:31.461 --> 05:33.550
Why doesn't everyone
steal their son's identity?

05:33.594 --> 05:35.378
Because Instagram makes people
feel like they

05:35.422 --> 05:37.337
have to be
"good" parents.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.426
So, what do ya think?
Grab a couple lava lamps

05:39.469 --> 05:42.254
and a fat stack of <i>Mad</i> magazines
for the coffee table,

05:42.298 --> 05:44.779
- call it a day?
- Stan, Hideki's fancy.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.868
You need to deck
your place out classy

05:46.911 --> 05:48.565
if you want to impress
a guy like him.

05:48.609 --> 05:52.003
Y-Yes, yes, of course.
Like how?

05:52.047 --> 05:54.223
Well, nothing screams
"I'm a cool rich guy"

05:54.266 --> 05:56.312
like art and crystals.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.769
And, to be honest, crystals are
just a good investment anyway.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.360
They're not
just beautiful.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.101
They channel energy,
have healing properties.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.103
They're really magnificent
little objects.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.844
You clearly have
a handle on this.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.499
You stay here and buy whatever's
going to impress Hideki.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.477
I'm gonna head back and get
started on the dinner menu.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.285
I'm thinkin' we scampi
everything.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.680
Great. But before you go,
watch this cool prank.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.121
- Hey!
- Aah! I got caught!

06:25.341 --> 06:27.212
I'm sorry.
We got off on the wrong foot.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.650
I'm Roger.
How 'bout I buy you a fresh dog?

06:32.348 --> 06:34.698
I get up to
Lake Wittenberg every summer.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.309
It's so sick.
You'll see.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.359
And this is the Pig Pen
Bar & Grille.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.754
Had some good nights at the Pen
with Perry and the boys.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.886
My local crew,
we're like brothers.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.193
Unfortunately,
he's away this weekend.

06:51.236 --> 06:54.979
But we'll still kill it.
This place is quaint as hell.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.984
This house
is only 400K.

07:00.028 --> 07:03.292
You know, Jeff,
if you kicked in $399,000,

07:03.335 --> 07:06.382
- we'd only need 1
- K
from another source.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.996
Uh-oh. It sounds like
the Pig Pen is goin' off!

07:14.129 --> 07:15.826
Sorry,
private party.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.307
Wait.
Is that Perry?

07:18.350 --> 07:22.877
Perry! Ha ha ha ha!
Get your dumb ass over here!

07:22.920 --> 07:26.315
I thought you were gone, bro?
This is great news!

07:26.358 --> 07:29.579
Yeah. Uh, this is actually
my rehearsal dinner.

07:29.623 --> 07:33.148
Smart. I wish I had
a rehearsal for this ice cream.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.326
He's funny.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.938
Y-You're getting married
without your boy Klaus?

07:40.982 --> 07:42.940
We're just having
a small thing.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.421
But I'm like 3 inches
in size.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
It doesn't get
any smaller than me!

07:47.510 --> 07:49.817
Sorry, man.

07:49.860 --> 07:53.211
This is outrageous.
We're boys!

07:53.255 --> 07:55.039
I should be
at that wedding.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.128
I should be giving a speech,
saying things like,

07:57.172 --> 07:59.348
"Now that you're married,
your dick is in prison!"

07:59.391 --> 08:01.524
Sorry, Mr. Klaus.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.614
I'm sure he just completely
forgot you existed.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.791
He can't get married
without me.

08:07.835 --> 08:12.796
So I guess that means
he <i>won't</i> be getting married.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.059
Oh, hey, since I drove,
do you mind

08:15.103 --> 08:16.757
tossing me a few bucks
for gas?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.672
Just like $200.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.719
Think we got
enough stuff?

08:22.763 --> 08:24.591
Stan, we got
everything we need.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.418
The crystals are assaulting
this place

08:26.462 --> 08:27.811
with good energy
as we speak.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.378
Something's different.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.206
Stan, did you
get a haircut?

08:31.249 --> 08:34.078
No, it's the decor!
I love it, Dad!

08:34.122 --> 08:37.473
Thank you, son. Someday,
it may all belong to you.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.561
That day is today.

08:40.302 --> 08:43.348
You've got this!
And one final charge-up.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.829
You can't be too careful
these days.

08:48.963 --> 08:51.705
Hi, guys!
Come on in.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.578
What is it, Hideki?

08:55.622 --> 08:59.277
It's just, I-I-I prefer
minimalism.

08:59.321 --> 09:02.454
So all this
badly hurts my eyes.

09:02.498 --> 09:06.067
Lead me
to the dining area.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.070
Mm.
So, I have a funny story.

09:09.113 --> 09:12.900
Guess who invited Snot up
to his hotel room last night?

09:12.943 --> 09:15.163
Pete Rose! Yeah.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.141
- So what happened was...
- How's the food, Hideki?

09:17.165 --> 09:21.473
The meat loaf is a bit...
stupid.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.868
You mean the...
scampi loaf?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.740
Is there anything better
than two men

09:26.783 --> 09:28.916
sipping brandy
in the master bedroom?

09:28.959 --> 09:30.352
Cigar?

09:30.395 --> 09:32.093
This is the warmest room
in the house.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.312
Feel free to
take your shirt off.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.620
Thanks for coming. I hope
you had a nice time, Hideki.

09:37.664 --> 09:41.668
Stan, I had...
an above-average time.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.279
Thank you,
and goodbye.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.586
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

09:46.629 --> 09:48.457
He had
an above-average time!

09:48.500 --> 09:50.677
There used to be a fly
in this wine.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.248
Why are we looking
for Perry again?

09:57.292 --> 10:00.295
I told you, because we're trying
to find Perry

10:00.338 --> 10:03.603
so I can give him one of these
lightly poisoned IPAs...

10:03.646 --> 10:06.562
- not enough to kill him.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.304
Yeah. She's gonna make
a great first wife.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.090
Excuse me.
We just want to warm up...

10:13.134 --> 10:15.092
Whaaa?
Is that Perry?

10:15.136 --> 10:16.790
Oh, hey, guys.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.835
Is this the dinner
you were rehearsing for?

10:18.879 --> 10:21.708
You're doing great!

10:21.751 --> 10:24.058
This guy's really funny.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.321
Like <i>Mad TV</i> funny.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.802
Hey, Perry, sorry if I
made things awkward earlier.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.761
How about a beer,
as a peace offering?

10:31.805 --> 10:34.677
Got a real fresh one here
for ya! Pssh!

10:34.721 --> 10:36.592
I'll just leave this
right next to you,

10:36.636 --> 10:37.941
and, uh...
we'll see you around.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.049
Okay, Jeff,
let's get out of here!

10:39.073 --> 10:41.162
Yes!
We did it!

10:41.205 --> 10:43.425
By the way, I know I gave you
a hard time in the car,

10:43.468 --> 10:45.993
but good call
on packing your wagon.

10:46.036 --> 10:49.474
It was definitely worth
100% of your suitcase space.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.697
He said he had
"an above-average time"!

10:54.741 --> 10:56.568
What a success.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.614
And well done
decorating the place.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.050
I wish
I could take credit,

11:00.094 --> 11:01.835
but the crystals did
the heavy lifting.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.576
Man, you really maximized the
hell out of that credit card.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.448
Credit card? Oh, no, no.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.711
That teen credit card barely
covered the sand painting

11:08.755 --> 11:11.061
of two Victorian chicks
sixty-nining.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.977
No, I had to take out
a $50,000 loan from a loan shark

11:14.021 --> 11:15.239
- to buy all that.
- What?

11:15.283 --> 11:17.546
Relax!
We don't have to pay it back.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.722
He made me leave my wallet
as collateral,

11:19.766 --> 11:22.420
but all that was in there was
Steve's stupid credit card!

11:22.464 --> 11:25.902
It's a common name.
They'll never track
it back to <i>our</i> Steve.

11:25.946 --> 11:29.036
And you're certain there wasn't
anything else in that wallet?

11:29.079 --> 11:32.039
Yep! I remember moving
everything out to my
new Peppa Pig wallet.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.780
Could I have missed something?
Possibly.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.478
I did it super fast while I was
rushing around Six Flags.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.219
But pretty sure I didn't.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.830
I had meth-focus that day.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.093
So I'm supposed to
feel "pretty sure"

11:43.137 --> 11:45.705
that a loan shark
won't come hunting my son?

11:45.748 --> 11:47.663
Nope. Can't do it.
Let's call the guy.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.926
Fine.
His name's Mike Donkey.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.102
But I'm telling you,
this really isn't necessary.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.800
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:53.843 --> 11:56.716
- Hi. Mike Donkey?
- Yeah.

11:56.759 --> 12:00.894
I think someone, uh, stole
my wallet and left it with you.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.766
It had a "Steve Smith"
teen credit card in it?

12:03.810 --> 12:05.768
Yep, got it right here.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.553
Been using it to weigh down
the lid on my chameleon tank.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.860
Good, good. So there was
nothing else in there

12:10.904 --> 12:12.166
besides the card,
right?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.037
Nope, very light wallet.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.560
Chameleons are moving it at will.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.693
Oh, thank God! I'll...
I'll just cancel the card.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.738
Thanks for your time!

12:18.781 --> 12:20.740
No, thank you...

12:20.783 --> 12:22.611
Stan Smith, is it?

12:22.654 --> 12:24.395
On Cherry Street?

12:24.439 --> 12:26.547
Because, until right now,
I didn't have enough information

12:26.571 --> 12:28.573
to track this kid down,

12:28.617 --> 12:31.141
but I just ran a search
on your phone number.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.143
I'm gonna guess your wallet
wasn't stolen

12:33.187 --> 12:35.232
and you were thinking of
ditching out on that loan?

12:35.276 --> 12:36.581
But you had to double-check
first

12:36.625 --> 12:38.211
because this kid
with your same last name

12:38.235 --> 12:39.802
is someone important
to you.

12:39.846 --> 12:40.934
This guy's good!

12:40.977 --> 12:42.718
What is he, your son?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.242
Cousin?
Non-blood nephew?

12:45.286 --> 12:47.288
You sound like a guy
with a sibling who adopts.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.203
You know,
it doesn't matter.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.963
What does matter is,
somebody's gonna pay me

12:50.987 --> 12:53.685
that 50 grand
by 6:00 P.M. tomorrow,

12:53.729 --> 12:56.645
or I'm finding the kid
and breaking his legs.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.605
- This is on me.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.651
This probably wouldn't have
happened if I gave you

13:02.694 --> 13:05.262
a tiny crystal to put in your
butthole before the call.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.571
How did I get in
this mess?!

13:09.614 --> 13:11.094
All I did
was whatever it took

13:11.138 --> 13:13.270
to impress my son's friend's
cool dad!

13:13.314 --> 13:15.707
Stan, Mike Donkey knows
where you live.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.492
I think the only way out
is to pay him.

13:17.535 --> 13:20.234
But how do we get 50 grand
in less than a day?!

13:20.277 --> 13:22.584
Hey, what if we
counterfeit the money?

13:22.627 --> 13:25.041
It doesn't have to be perfect,
just close enough to trick him.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.284
Great thought, but my printer
just crapped out on me.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.158
- I think it's out of ink.
- Damn it!

13:31.201 --> 13:33.551
We need something,
or Steve's legs are toast!

13:33.595 --> 13:36.554
We could probably get 25 grand
for your SUV, right?

13:36.598 --> 13:38.861
What if we sold it,
then went to Atlantic City

13:38.905 --> 13:41.124
and tried to double that money
up at a casino?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.561
And leave my son's
very legs to chance?

13:43.605 --> 13:45.999
Chance? Are you forgetting
we have the power

13:46.042 --> 13:48.001
of the crystals
on our side, Stan?

13:48.044 --> 13:50.133
I'm not doubting the crystals
are absolute beasts,

13:50.177 --> 13:52.832
it's just...
maybe there's another way.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.659
Sure, think on it.
Take some time.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.115
But we both know
we're gonna do this,

13:56.139 --> 13:57.880
so I'm gonna go ahead
and pack.

14:00.796 --> 14:03.886
Okay. Let's split up
and start chipping away
at separate tables.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.975
We're not gonna win 50 grand
grinding away

14:06.019 --> 14:07.455
at five-dollar
blackjack.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.370
We gotta go
balls to the wall.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.676
I say we go to the room
and charge up with the crystals

14:11.720 --> 14:13.722
until the last
possible minute.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.551
Then we hit the tables at max
power and bet it all on red.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.466
We'll be so juiced,
it's gotta hit!

14:18.509 --> 14:20.685
Smart.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.340
- Can you feel 'em working?
- I think so!

14:23.384 --> 14:25.081
Do they make your lower back
tighten up?

14:26.953 --> 14:29.694
Oh, yeah, I forgot Jabbawockeez
are performing here.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.934
Hey, if we're just gonna be
sittin' around absorbing energy,

14:31.958 --> 14:33.785
we might as well enjoy
the hotel, right?

14:33.829 --> 14:35.372
- What about the crystals?
- We'll bring 'em with us,

14:35.396 --> 14:36.527
charge up in luxury.

14:36.571 --> 14:37.877
We've earned it!

14:37.920 --> 14:39.748
You're right.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.924
We earned this.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.546
I guarantee they charged up
before the show.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.201
That move's impossible
without crystals.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.465
See ya!
Goin' on my Sunday stroll!

15:01.509 --> 15:04.947
I'm gettin' tired of this
Sunday Stroll shit.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.819
Oh, my God,
thank you!

15:17.525 --> 15:19.570

15:35.325 --> 15:37.501
- Hey, boss,

15:37.545 --> 15:39.939
we got the kid's beautiful legs
in our sights.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.637
Don't move on him yet.
They have a little more time.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.204
And I know
we're working,

15:44.247 --> 15:46.336
but you don't have to
call me "boss."

15:46.380 --> 15:49.470
You can call me "Dad,"
Mike Donkey Jr.

15:51.907 --> 15:55.258
Here we go.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.913
$25,000 on red.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.398
Or maybe black!
Stan, what did you do?!

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
Red! I did it!

16:13.973 --> 16:16.149
Hell yeah!
The power of crystals!

16:16.192 --> 16:17.759
- Mm.
- Mm.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.457
Stan, do we...
double down?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.677
The crystals are
clearly working.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.679
It would solve
a lot of problems.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.290
I could finally go nuts
in that Men's Wearhouse.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.466
Let's do it!

16:34.602 --> 16:37.561
I'm not even gonna watch,
'cause I know we're gonna win.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.737
We are so charged,
we could fly to the moon.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.043
Ye-ea-eah! Yes!

16:41.087 --> 16:42.914
- Red!
- Yeah!

16:42.958 --> 16:45.613
- Mm.
- Mm. One more?

16:45.656 --> 16:47.504
I mean, they're basically giving
away money at this point.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.443
We gotta, right?

16:58.974 --> 17:01.629
- Yeah! Yes! Yeah!
- Ye-ea-eah!

17:01.672 --> 17:05.067
I can't believe we doubled down
and won five times!

17:05.111 --> 17:06.938
Pull over.
I gotta take a leak.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.811
That's the crystals. They have
no patience for toxins.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.685
We only have an hour
to pay the loan shark.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.819
Might have to pee from the
bathroom doorway to save time.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.131
All right, let's go pay
this scumbag.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.354
Uh, Roger,
does it feel like

17:31.398 --> 17:33.269
the car's riding a little lower
to you?

17:33.313 --> 17:36.751
No, it's...
always been this way.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.625
It's not my fault, Stan!
Look how huge it is!

17:41.669 --> 17:44.106
I was powerless to
its lavender pull!

17:44.150 --> 17:47.283
Roger, how much of our winnings
did you spend?

17:47.327 --> 17:50.112
Just... all of them?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.593
My boy's gonna get
his legs mangled!

17:52.636 --> 17:56.118
I, for one, think Steve's legs
are a small price to pay

17:56.162 --> 17:58.729
for the wonderful weekend
we've shared together!

18:01.645 --> 18:03.908
Any minute now, the wedding
planner is gonna run by,

18:03.952 --> 18:07.173
yelling that the groom's sick
and the wedding's off.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.000
Ooh!
It's gonna be so sweet!

18:09.044 --> 18:13.048
I'm sitting extra still, because
if I do, I get s'mores later!

18:13.092 --> 18:15.355
- Here we go!

18:15.398 --> 18:17.792
My best man
is violently ill!

18:17.835 --> 18:20.751
No, he's not.
Y-You are.

18:20.795 --> 18:24.190
I don't know what happened.
He only had one IPA last night.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.931
But the show must go on.

18:26.975 --> 18:30.109
It feels meant to be that
I bumped into you, Klaus.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.285
Would you...

18:32.328 --> 18:34.939
let me borrow Jeff
to be my new best man?

18:34.983 --> 18:37.333
I just love him.
He's so funny.

18:39.074 --> 18:43.600
And now that Perry is married,
his dick is in prison!

18:46.037 --> 18:48.083
That was <i>my</i> joke!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.519
I'll give him credit,
it took balls

18:49.563 --> 18:52.000
making it his entire speech,
but still.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.959
He's gettin' a poisoned IPA!

18:58.311 --> 19:01.140
Oh, no.
Are you kidding me?!

19:01.183 --> 19:07.146
These poisoned beers have been
nothing... but... trouble.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.887
I'm gonna call Mike Donkey
and try to get an extension.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.283
Extension denied.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.981
Mr. Donkey, please!
Let my boy go!

19:17.025 --> 19:18.722
Break my legs instead!

19:18.766 --> 19:21.072
No, the kid's legs
were the deal.

19:21.116 --> 19:24.293
And, unlike you,
I honor my deals.

19:24.337 --> 19:27.427
Wait! What if I told you
this giant crystal

19:27.470 --> 19:30.473
is powerful enough
to win any bet we want?

19:30.517 --> 19:33.128
I propose we all go
to Atlantic City,

19:33.172 --> 19:35.217
and we'll win what we owe you,
times 10.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.611
Guaranteed.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.745
We're just gonna
break the legs.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.922
Come on, guys.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.228
- You can't really...
- Ohh!

19:46.272 --> 19:49.318
Ohh! Ohh!

19:49.362 --> 19:51.538
Hmm.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.844
Yeah, I've never had to
go this route before.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.107
The deal was pay
or get his legs broken.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.066
So, yeah, I guess
we're all square.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.937
Pleasure doing business
with you.

20:03.724 --> 20:07.249
What could have possibly
led to this?!

20:09.164 --> 20:11.210
It's all my fault!

20:11.253 --> 20:13.995
If I wasn't so desperate to
impress someone richer than me,

20:14.038 --> 20:16.563
this never would've
snowballed out of control!

20:16.606 --> 20:18.173
Everything's
gonna be fine.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.480
No, it's not!
My boy is broken!

20:20.523 --> 20:22.873
This baby's powerful enough
to heal a hundred legs

20:22.917 --> 20:24.179
in mere minutes.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.966
Shh, let the crystal
do its job.

20:29.010 --> 20:32.970
It's woooooorrrrrkkinnnngg.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.712
Your eight brutal weeks
of physical therapy

20:35.756 --> 20:39.673
is woooooorrrrrkkinnnngg.

20:39.716 --> 20:43.590
I'm doing it! Come on!
Stroll with me!

20:51.946 --> 20:53.382
Aah!

20:53.426 --> 20:56.559
Steve,
you're doing it!

20:56.603 --> 20:58.605
Bye!
Have a great time!
