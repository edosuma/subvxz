47:22.840 --> 47:25.712
I am calling from the MercyHospital in Paris, France.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.107
Yesterday evening
there was an accident

47:29.150 --> 47:32.284
on the Rue Saint-Michel
in the Latin Quarter.

47:32.327 --> 47:34.808
Your sister was struck by a car,

47:34.852 --> 47:37.376
she was taken to my hospital.

47:37.419 --> 47:41.510
We did everything we could,but she has passed away.

47:41.554 --> 47:44.470
I am very sorry for your loss.

51:52.805 --> 51:55.155
And then gave the ant a big hug.

51:56.939 --> 51:59.028
Are you excited to move
into your own bedroom?

52:00.595 --> 52:01.422
Are you scared?

52:03.120 --> 52:06.166
I remember when I firstmoved into my own bedroom,

52:06.210 --> 52:07.646
I was scared too.

52:07.689 --> 52:09.169
I'm gonna tell you
a little secret.

52:09.213 --> 52:12.041
If you sleep with thismagic blanket every night,

1:00:10.389 --> 1:00:13.044
[water sloshing]

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.485
- Are we gonna have
enough air in here?

1:00:19.528 --> 1:00:22.531
- We'll have enough air toget us through the storm.

1:00:22.575 --> 1:00:23.620
You okay, Bug?

1:00:24.577 --> 1:00:26.623

We have to go help.- Listen, listen, Bug, Listen.

1:00:37.764 --> 1:00:40.593
We can't go swimming in
a storm like this, okay?

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:43.552
We run the risk of otherboats not being able to see us

1:00:43.596 --> 1:00:45.380
or we might get lost.

1:00:45.424 --> 1:00:48.732
So we gotta take
cover the best we can.

1:00:48.775 --> 1:00:50.081
Alright?

Sometimes the most
important thing

1:00:51.430 --> 1:00:54.563

take care of yourself.

Okay?

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:58.655
