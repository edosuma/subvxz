WEBVTT

00:17.400 --> 00:19.000
STATE PENITENTIARY

00:23.160 --> 00:25.480
Why isn't he out yet?
It's been an hour already.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.120
Beats me, honey.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.400
What's wrong?

00:32.480 --> 00:34.440
His girl's waiting outside, too.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.400
Nothing's wrong. Everybody knows
Lorena is the love of my life.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.440
-Still...
-Still?

00:41.520 --> 00:43.440
Ten days and he'll be here.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.960
"He"?
Who is "he"?

00:45.040 --> 00:46.920
Get outta town!
"Who is he," he asks!

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
"Who is he?"
You gotta be kidding.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.880
I'm on duty that day.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.360
The Captain, that's who!

00:53.880 --> 00:54.960
What "captain"?
Out with it!

00:55.040 --> 00:56.120
"What captain?"

00:56.200 --> 00:57.760
I want to stay in jail
for ten more days

00:57.840 --> 00:58.960
and you ask "What captain?"

00:59.040 --> 01:00.800
There's only one captain, warden.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.400
Please, just ten more days.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.600
When will I get another chance
to meet Francesco Totti?

01:11.520 --> 01:14.520
-Number 1, Wojciech...
-Szczęsny!

01:15.560 --> 01:19.080
-Number 2, Antonio...
-Rüdiger!

01:19.680 --> 01:22.760
-Number 20, Federico...
-Fazio!

01:22.840 --> 01:26.760
-Number 44, Kostas...
-Manōlas!

01:27.440 --> 01:30.640
-Number 33, Emerson...
-Palmieri!

01:30.720 --> 01:34.120
-Number 16, Daniele...
-De Rossi!

01:34.200 --> 01:37.520
-Number 6, Kevin...
-Strootman!

01:38.320 --> 01:41.760
-Number 11, Mohamed...
-Salah!

01:41.840 --> 01:45.560
-Number 92, Stephan...
-El Shaarawy!

01:45.640 --> 01:49.760
-Number 4, Radja...
-Nainggolan!

01:49.840 --> 01:53.560
-Number 9, Edin...
-Džeko !

01:54.840 --> 01:56.000
On the sidelines...

01:57.000 --> 02:00.680
He was born a soccer player,
grew up a myth

02:00.760 --> 02:02.880
and now, a legend.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.720
Thank you, Captain.
Number 10, Francesco...

02:06.800 --> 02:08.480
TOTTI: ONE CAPTAIN

02:08.560 --> 02:09.880
Totti!

02:10.200 --> 02:12.120
DECEMBER 2015
Everything ends, sooner or later.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.520
"End."

02:14.120 --> 02:17.360
It's such a lousy word. Heinous.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.000
It hides in all places,
like a rat.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.840
And when the end seems far away...
you don't think about it.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.480
Then suddenly you see it there,
a stone's throw away.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.320
As if in waiting.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.440
So close, it's no effort
for it to take away

02:36.600 --> 02:38.520
what little time you have left.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.920
One trip, one push,
one wrong move... and you're done.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.640
That's what happened to me.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.160
A slightly-too-long forward pass...
and I got injured.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.760
On my 39th birthday,
just like that.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.440
At my age, it could be over.
Playing, loving, living.

03:01.480 --> 03:05.840
'Cause that's what soccer is to me:
playing, loving, living.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.960
And I wish it would never end.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.560
-What do you think?
-Me? Nothing.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.200
Let's wait for the doctor.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.000
See that?

03:17.480 --> 03:20.600
Professor Pier Paolo Mariani.
The man who fixed my everything.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.920
Bones, ligaments, muscles.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.440
The other's Vito Scala.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.240
He took me by the hand when I was
still a kid and never left my side.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.640
If I'm sending him a kiss,
it's because I'm scared shitless.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.480
-You see where it reattached itself?
-Why? Where is it?

03:35.560 --> 03:38.880
-Don't be impatient, Francesco.
-Yeah, where's the rush, right?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.000
He's only about to tell me
whether it's all over.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.080
Three hours gone by
and still nothing.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.080
I have a bad feeling.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.480
I don't know how you can sit there
like nothing's going on.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.920
If I get up, they'll tell us
something sooner?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.040
-Right. I'm calling Ilary.
-Again...

04:00.400 --> 04:01.600
Still no news, Fiorella.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.400
I haven't heard from them,
I'd have called you otherwise.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.600
I have this bad feeling...

04:05.800 --> 04:07.400
Never mind bad feelings.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.760
-You idiot!
-Cristian, let your sister play.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.200
Look, Fiorella,
soon as I know anything...

04:13.480 --> 04:15.440
I think they just got home,
I'll call you back.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.480
No, no, no,
I'll wait on the line, don't...

04:19.840 --> 04:21.120
Did she hang up?

04:22.120 --> 04:23.200
Or is it poor connection?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.320
The latter.
Must be the power line.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.840
Well?

04:32.760 --> 04:34.320
-Fra'!
-Wanna tell her?

04:34.400 --> 04:35.520
Is it that bad?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.160
Fra'.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.680
You pair of jerks!

04:44.760 --> 04:45.920
You're laughing now?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.320
You moron.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.480
-You made me laugh.
-Right on the finish line!

04:50.560 --> 04:54.280
-Come on! How did it go?
-It ended up being fine.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.280
I have to take it easy,
but I can still play.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.200
I swear, it was awful.
I was shitting bricks.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.920
Ten years ago,
I wouldn't have hurt myself.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.160
Five years ago, it would've taken me
half the time to recover.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.040
Now, at 39, I had to "take it easy."

05:12.640 --> 05:14.600
But I've got something that nobody has.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.000
Something that makes
injuries mean less

05:18.080 --> 05:21.280
and if your legs get stiff,
it's not as serious

05:21.360 --> 05:23.600
'cause you don't need to run
as fast as a young man.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.760
Something that tells time
to screw itself.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.720
A gift. That's what I have.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
What is it?

05:45.760 --> 05:48.560
I don't know.
He just keeps kicking.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.680
That's me at eleven months.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.920
That's ten plus one.

06:07.560 --> 06:12.080
Other kids still clung to walkers,
and I had a ball glued to my foot.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.880
Or so they tell me.
It's not as if I can remember.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.720
What I do know
is that it never left my feet.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.680
Here he comes again.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.360
I'm sick of him.
Just tell him no.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.960
I'm not telling him,
you do it.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.640
-Will you let him play?
-Look, mister Enzo...

06:39.720 --> 06:40.760
Five minutes.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.720
-We'll have to make new teams.
-That's no big deal.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.000
Yo, what's the hold-up?

06:45.280 --> 06:46.640
I've got homework too!

06:49.240 --> 06:52.000
The point is, we don't look good
playing with this dwarf.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.240
C'mon, make my kid happy.
Where's the harm in that?

06:58.480 --> 07:02.240
Fine. Come on, Pipsqueak.
Four-Eyes, Gimp, you two come here.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.160
FOUR-EYES, PIPSQUEAK, GIMP:
TEAM PIPSQUEAK

07:04.320 --> 07:05.760
The other five with me.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.720
We looked like wimps, great job.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.200
You said to let him play.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.320
Look at that.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.960
We tried, we gave him Four-Eyes
and the Gimp, but he plays on his own.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.280
I say we stop coming here,
and that's that.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.280
Poor kids. They thought
I was someone

07:35.360 --> 07:37.480
who was just a little
better than they were.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.640
They didn't know
supernatural forces were at play.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.400
Fine, perhaps the beam
of light's too much

08:08.480 --> 08:10.440
but I swear that's just
the way it went.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.880
We're talking about John Paul II

08:12.960 --> 08:16.520
not just any Pope.
They even made him a saint.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.360
Now, to be honest...

08:18.440 --> 08:20.520
JAN CORNELIUS MORRIS
THEOLOGY PROFESSOR

08:20.600 --> 08:22.440
This event was not taken
into consideration

08:22.520 --> 08:25.320
in His Holiness's
beatification process.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.360
We had no record of it.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.360
But it did happen.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.440
Now, I might not have been
the best there ever was

08:31.800 --> 08:33.160
I never claimed as much

08:33.520 --> 08:36.200
but can others say
they were touched that way

08:36.360 --> 08:38.320
by a Pope who then
became a saint?

08:39.920 --> 08:43.320
In short, I had the gift,
and it prolonged my life.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.320
It went well
with that last injury

08:45.680 --> 08:49.720
but 39 is still a lot,
too old for soccer.

08:49.800 --> 08:53.320
We're like dogs, like Labradors.
One year for us

08:53.760 --> 08:55.800
is like seven to those
who have a normal job.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.040
And at that point there are
no saints, no gifts to help you

08:59.280 --> 09:02.560
you need someone to manage you,
someone who loves you.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.200
And I had found him.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.880
Rudi Garcia, a Frenchman
who had a Spanish name

09:08.280 --> 09:10.960
but spoke Italian
with a Frenchman's accent.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.840
Did you catch all that?

09:12.960 --> 09:16.000
You're the first player I've trained
with his own office.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.040
I'm sure there's a reason.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.840
How come you still
want to play at your age?

09:20.920 --> 09:23.680
It's what I'm best at.
It's my whole life.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.840
What do you expect from me?

09:25.920 --> 09:31.360
I know how old I am.
I know I can't play every match

09:31.440 --> 09:32.960
or the whole 90 minutes.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.960
But I still have a lot to give
to this jersey, I'm sure.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.720
I'd rather use the office
for the trophies.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.360
-Then let's win more for it.
-You'll have to let me play, then.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.240
We understood each other
right away.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.520
Those first two seasons went great,
as a result.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.040
Two second places

09:52.240 --> 09:55.000
and a comeback to the top of European
football: the Champions League.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.520
ROMA VS. CARPI
SEPTEMBER 26th, 2015

09:56.600 --> 10:00.040
Then, fate made me trip.
I hurt myself at the age of 39.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.080
And when I needed him the most
to come back from my injury...

10:04.160 --> 10:05.400
ROMA HUMILIATED

10:05.480 --> 10:07.960
...that's when the team
hit a streak of awful games.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.040
What happened then?
The usual.

10:12.240 --> 10:17.640
The curse of Roma's coaches
falls upon Garcia like lightning.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.960
Two, three years
and they're all sent packing.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.800
All of 'em.
One year it was five in a row!

10:25.280 --> 10:26.320
Look at him.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.120
Looks like he already knows
he's through.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.440
I feel so sorry for him.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.760
So do I.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.960
-He's looking at us.
-Guess who wants to take his place.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.520
So, he wants to come back?

10:44.480 --> 10:45.880
That's what his people wrote me.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.880
It wouldn't be too bad.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.800
He already knows
what he'd be dealing with, right?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.400
If we have to wait for another
to start from scratch...

10:56.280 --> 10:58.040
It won't look good, Daniele.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.760
And not just for Roma.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.120
Shut the hell up.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.720
Hi.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.200
How did it go?

12:36.040 --> 12:37.280
It went well.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.000
-They threw eggs at us.
-Eggs?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.240
Like what?

12:44.240 --> 12:46.840
Maybe they got it wrong,
they thought it was Easter.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.320
How's my favorite football?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.360
Good.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.480
-Is it moving?
-It's sleeping now.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.360
Good for it.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.520
You can play with it
for another couple of months.

13:09.680 --> 13:10.760
And then?

13:11.640 --> 13:16.440
Then it'll stop being a football
and become something else.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.160
-A baby.
-Yes.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.240
A new life.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.040
Am I supposed to get a hint?

13:31.640 --> 13:32.920
It's not the end,
Francesco.

13:45.840 --> 13:46.920
I know.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.800
Ilary, you gave up
something important

13:53.320 --> 13:55.840
by leaving the TV show "Le Iene"
to focus on your pregnancy.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.880
DECEMBER 17th, 2015

13:57.960 --> 14:00.840
-It's a wrap!
-We're done, Diana.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.880
Guys, we're done.
I'm done, I don't know about you.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.560
No, Emma, stop. Please, stop
or I'm going to give birth here.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.760
-I'm going to miss you.
-Thanks for everything.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.520
-Let me know when it's due.
-I will. Bye, Ale.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.000
-Good luck.
-Thank you, thank you.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.920
Well, it wasn't me "giving up".
I made a choice.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.600
What about Francesco? Any plans
for when he'll have to stop playing?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.000
-Hey, Ma?
-Francesco, where are you?

14:33.080 --> 14:36.320
-I'm on my way home, why?
-What do you mean, why? Ilary's interview.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.080
-What interview?
-What do you think? The one in the paper.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.360
In the paper, sure.
I knew that.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.480
-So?
-So what? What did she say?

14:43.560 --> 14:46.080
What, you're playing dumb?
Feigning obliviousness?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.960
Mom, I  am  oblivious.
What are we talking about?

14:49.040 --> 14:51.520
Hey! I'm your mother.
I know you better than anyone else

14:51.600 --> 14:53.680
and I know you're a damn liar.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.920
Look, Mom...

14:56.360 --> 14:59.240
Don't you "Mom" me.
Didn't you think about me?

14:59.320 --> 15:03.040
That I had a right to know?
And what about your poor old father?

15:03.120 --> 15:05.200
A right to know what?
What are you talking about?

15:05.280 --> 15:09.320
Everyone called me. Everyone!
Even the priest. He asked me if I knew.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.320
I said, "Of course I know."
But I didn't know a thing.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.880
Now tell me
that's the right way to behave.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.040
Mom, I'm in a tunnel.
Can you hear me?

15:18.120 --> 15:21.720
I can't hear you, Ma,
I'm in a tunnel. Hello? Hello?

15:25.680 --> 15:28.000
Fiorella, at least take your hat off.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.840
-Call Ilary.
-I didn't get that.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.720
-Call Il--
-I didn't get that.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.120
What is it, Mom?

15:37.200 --> 15:40.840
Don't you dare
play tricks on me, boy!

15:40.920 --> 15:42.880
Mom, I don't know
what Ilary said!

15:43.120 --> 15:45.120
He's not talking.
He's your son, all right.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.320
A family of mutes.

15:51.440 --> 15:55.120
It's funny: I retired before he did.
I beat him to the punch.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.960
But you know, next year
Francesco will be 40 years old.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.440
How does the saying go?

16:00.520 --> 16:03.520
"Every season has its melon."
Right? Is that how it goes?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.280
-I think so.
-Yeah.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.640
And he truly enjoyed
life to its fullest.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.760
So now I think he might wish
for something else.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.720
But he'll still be
in the soccer world, don't worry.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.840
-Oh, yeah?
-You looked pretty upset for a second.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.800
-No, he'll always be in that field.
-You just gave me my first scoop.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.120
-Shall we take pictures?
-All right, let's do it.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.320
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.760
Next time you announce my retirement,
tell my mother first.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.080
I spoke my mind.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.040
It didn't sound
like your personal opinion.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.160
I don't want a carrot!

16:45.920 --> 16:48.920
It sounded like it came from me.
I  don't  wish for anything else.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.680
Maybe it's high time you did

16:51.320 --> 16:53.360
because "something else"
will come.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.440
Sooner or later.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.640
I'd rather it be later.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.640
Look, I said it for you.
I'm  still  saying it for you.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.560
You have to start
thinking about it.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.040
Are you inside my head?
Do you know what I'm thinking?

17:04.120 --> 17:05.240
No, but I know you--

17:05.320 --> 17:07.720
I  only  think about it,
what do you know?

17:07.800 --> 17:10.320
No, Francesco, you think about it
as if it's death.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.880
When I say "Think about it,"
I mean prepare yourself mentally.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.120
I have to prepare
for the next game, that's all.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.240
The rest is small talk.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.880
If you want
to make small talk

17:18.960 --> 17:22.720
open up a newsstand
or go to the hairdresser and chat.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.000
Do you even hear yourself?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.560
You compared me to a melon...

17:36.800 --> 17:38.720
-A melon.
-Would a pear be better?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
I'd prefer being the one
saying when I'll retire.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.760
Look, Ilary.
Recovery's going well.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.640
If the right coach comes along,
I'll have two more years.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.080
Three, even.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.240
Spalletti's new Roma dawns in Miami.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.480
Meeting in the night
between the coach and Pallotta.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.840
SPALLETTI THE NEW ROMA COACH

18:17.000 --> 18:18.840
Meanwhile in Trigoria,
Garcia oversaw his last session.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.760
Who knows? Maybe...

18:22.080 --> 18:23.160
You think so?

18:24.440 --> 18:25.960
It's the same old story...

18:27.040 --> 18:31.480
I came here because
coaching Roma is great.

18:31.560 --> 18:36.200
So, the rest is all...
all canceled.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.120
SPALLETTI'S FIRST STATEMENT

18:38.200 --> 18:40.560
I also came
because I was asked

18:40.640 --> 18:45.240
by three special fans
to whom I couldn't say no.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.240
Who are they?

18:50.720 --> 18:51.880
My children.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.280
Aren't you happy
about Baldy?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.880
Giancarlo: a friend,
but more like a brother.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.680
Angelo: a cousin,
but more than a brother.

19:05.080 --> 19:10.240
If they talked, I'd be ruined.
Inseparable since we were kids.

19:10.960 --> 19:11.960
Well?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.760
I don't know.
Are you happy to have him back?

19:17.600 --> 19:21.360
I am. He knows the club,
and also he knows me, right?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.840
-That's for sure.
-He knows what I can give.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.680
I'm terribly sorry
for Rudi, but...

19:27.920 --> 19:31.720
In the end, of all coaches,
Luciano is the best for our comeback.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.320
-Yes, but has he called you?
-Not yet.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.240
Don't you think it's odd?

19:36.320 --> 19:39.280
-He's a friend, isn't he?
-Look, forget it, I misspoke.

19:41.080 --> 19:46.560
-It's just that I have a funny feeling.
-"A funny feeling." What are you, a wizard?

19:46.840 --> 19:48.040
Well, he's been right before.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.440
WE ARE ROMA

19:51.280 --> 19:54.120
He wasn't a traditional coach,
all cold and detached.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
He was blunt,
he said things to your face.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.880
Look, Checco, let's face it,
you train at 30, 40%...

20:00.960 --> 20:03.320
But no, you have
to set yourself free.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.120
Do like I do, free yourself.
Shirt first... tracksuit...

20:08.200 --> 20:09.600
And coming back to Roma
took guts.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.160
He was on the rise,
he could go wherever.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.520
At 100%, go!

20:14.600 --> 20:16.560
But he came to us instead,
in our time of crisis.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.400
Sock number one, go!

20:18.480 --> 20:20.320
Sock number two, go!

20:20.400 --> 20:22.840
And I found him likable,
because he was crazy!

20:24.400 --> 20:25.440
Underpants!

20:25.600 --> 20:28.000
A coach who does something like that...
you gotta love him.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.800
I did, and he loved me.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.280
When I got badly injured, ten years ago,
no one was close to me like him.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.240
VILLA STUART CLINIC

20:35.320 --> 20:36.560
He came every night.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.920
Every night.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.520
-Were you asleep?
-Hey, how could I?

20:52.840 --> 20:53.880
Good.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.160
Look what I brought you tonight.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.560
-You brought a whiteboard?
-And you know why?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.160
Because now...

21:02.960 --> 21:06.560
You and I together
are going to paint next year's Roma.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.800
With a brush?

21:08.840 --> 21:09.760
Listen...

21:11.120 --> 21:12.400
How did you get in here with that?

21:13.040 --> 21:16.600
Now I'll explain all our options,
and then together

21:17.120 --> 21:19.600
we'll evaluate
each player's pros and cons.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.560
Don't think about money,
just choose one for each role. All right?

21:24.080 --> 21:26.600
I'll tell you right away that
I already have an idea for the attack.

21:26.960 --> 21:30.600
So: Doni, for sure,
Panucci...

21:32.080 --> 21:32.920
Mexes.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.120
Vučinić.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.360
He's good.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.480
He did that.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.280
Were you asleep?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.760
Every night.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.960
He always came at the same time.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.000
Were you asleep?

21:52.440 --> 21:56.720
I wasn't. I was pretending.
That's how I know he left at 3am.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.840
He did it to keep my spirits high,
to make me want to look ahead.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.880
Were you asleep?

22:02.960 --> 22:06.720
"Checco." He called me
by a nickname only friends would use.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.080
Then clearly, it's obvious
that if Perrotta can't make it

22:10.160 --> 22:13.280
I'll put you behind and...

22:16.480 --> 22:18.400
That's why I was glad
to see him was come back.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.800
Thank you, thank you.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.240
-Hi, Vito.
-Coach.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.320
-Francesco, how are you?
-Great.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.840
Good to hear. Ready.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.080
Hurry up, I got a lot to do, come on.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.480
-Francesco.
-Francesco, in the middle, thanks.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.680
Those who know me,
know that I speak clearly

23:06.960 --> 23:09.800
and I'm telling you
there are no more alibis.

23:09.880 --> 23:14.840
Is that clear? No more excuses,
you're either winning... or you're winning.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.080
And it's not about preparation,
it's not about your legs.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.960
It's about your head.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.400
Without it, tactics,
schemes, talent

23:25.480 --> 23:29.440
even coaches,
they are useless, meaningless.

23:29.760 --> 23:33.360
You need to be in the game,
be focused

23:33.840 --> 23:37.160
because for us, from now on,
every Sunday is a final.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.720
In or out.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.840
I've learned that,
on the eve of your last game

23:44.240 --> 23:48.160
some of you were up late
playing cards.

23:49.160 --> 23:53.160
You're joking.
I really hope you are.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.840
I do not want you playing cards

23:56.160 --> 23:59.720
as your club rules
already clearly state.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.520
Is that clear?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.640
Why am I making this face?

24:09.200 --> 24:10.320
A little game?

24:12.960 --> 24:14.000
Francesco...

24:17.880 --> 24:20.160
You were amazing. Cigarette?

24:20.880 --> 24:23.200
A little game?
What do you say? Wanna play?

24:23.280 --> 24:25.240
'Cause I'm obsessed with cards.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.640
A game of Tressette?

24:28.480 --> 24:30.520
-Were you sleeping?
-It's 2am, what do you think?

24:30.800 --> 24:33.280
-Then let's play Briscola, it's quicker.
-We'll play tomorrow.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.440
-It's already tomorrow.
-The day after tomorrow.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800
And Spalletti knew that.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.560
Good. Is that clear?

24:40.640 --> 24:43.680
Putting a ban on playing cards
was clearly aimed at me.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.520
That rulebook's optional, coach.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.400
It's there to...
Hardly anyone signed it.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.880
Checco, don't be a pain in my ass!

25:02.040 --> 25:05.000
I thought I'd misheard,
it wasn't possible.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.120
Don't be a pain in my ass.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.040
Saying something like that to me,
the team captain...

25:17.400 --> 25:21.080
Checco, don't be a pain in my ass.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.520
That's exactly what he said.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.120
Five times one-fourth...

25:39.280 --> 25:40.480
Five time one-fourth?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.240
Hey.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.560
What?

25:43.720 --> 25:45.120
-Five times one-fourth?
-Well?

25:45.480 --> 25:47.440
-How much is that?
-Am I supposed to tell you?

25:47.520 --> 25:48.760
You're the one in school.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.040
-Are you nervous?
-No.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.280
You're biting your nails.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.600
Mom says you always do that
when you're nervous.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.560
What does that mean?
It's just a habit.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
-Don't you ever bite your nails?
-No.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.200
Yeah, you bite your nails too.
You do.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.760
She says she can tell how you're doing
by looking at your nails.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.440
Are we listening to Mom now?

26:15.560 --> 26:17.240
Mom always thinks
she knows everything.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.000
Are you here with me
or with Mom?

26:27.560 --> 26:30.360
-Five plus...?
-Five times one-fourth.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.760
-How did you do these?
-I did these in school.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.120
And you don't you remember how?

26:38.200 --> 26:39.120
No.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.200
-You copied?
-No.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.680
What do you mean, no?
You did it in school but not here?

26:45.480 --> 26:47.280
Do them again. So...

26:48.400 --> 26:50.560
But you did study these, right?

26:51.640 --> 26:53.520
It was a long time ago, Cris.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.840
-You must remember something.
-No.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.120
-Five plus... Five plus one?
-Six.

27:02.080 --> 27:02.920
Plus...

27:03.800 --> 27:05.040
One-fourth?

27:06.040 --> 27:07.040
Ten.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.000
That's my number.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.000
Francesco. Hey, wait.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.120
Listen, Spalletti came to me.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.800
-Hi, Stefano.
-Hello, Francesco.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.040
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.800
-What's this about cards?
-Again with the cards?

27:30.880 --> 27:32.760
Don't take it out on me.
He came and said

27:32.840 --> 27:35.640
"Tell your friend he must sign
the rulebook like the others."

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
With all the trouble Roma's got right now,
he's fixating on cards?

27:39.080 --> 27:41.800
-What do you want from me?
-Why doesn't he tell me in person?

27:42.040 --> 27:45.400
Does he need a messenger?
Are we playing the telephone game?

27:45.480 --> 27:47.600
Maybe it's because he knew
it would piss you off.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.440
Of course it pisses me off.

27:49.520 --> 27:53.040
Age has played a number on him.
I don't like how things have started.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.760
-I know, you're right.
-It's really weird.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.000
But he's got one hell
of a burden on his hands.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.920
So what? He never acted
like this before, Vito.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I know, but you have
to calm down.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.360
-You have to focus, all right?
-I am.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.240
You need to work hard,
train until you're at 100%.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.200
-I know, but you know what I'm doing.
-I know, I see it every day.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.560
That's what you need
with him, too.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.920
If you give it your all,
you'll see, he'll forget about the cards.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.720
-Hopefully.
-Trust me on this.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.840
Defense, stay close to him.
Don't let him pass.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.200
-Watch it.
-Here too.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.600
Daniele, get close to him.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.600
-The others, on with the pressing.
-Pass it, pass it.

28:27.680 --> 28:30.240
Pass the ball, pass the ball!

28:32.040 --> 28:34.920
Stop! Head in the game!

28:35.000 --> 28:37.920
-You have to be focused.
-We are, don't fret about it.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.200
No, if someone with your feet
makes this kind of mistake

28:41.280 --> 28:43.080
it means he's not focused.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.880
Screw you, he talks
about my feet now.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.600
-Hey, come here.
-Don't worry about it.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.360
-How dare you?
-Hey, screw you, pal!

28:48.440 --> 28:50.880
You're not talking to a kid.
I'm coming back from an injury.

28:51.360 --> 28:52.680
You should worry
about how I'm doing!

28:52.760 --> 28:55.160
-The doctors already told me.
-You should talk to me, not my doctors!

28:55.880 --> 28:58.280
I'm working hard to get back in shape
while you yell and get mad.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.840
Don't you see
you're not helping me?

28:59.920 --> 29:04.160
Don't  you  see that if I'm here,
it's 'cause you've all sucked until now?

29:04.240 --> 29:05.520
So why are you
just telling me?

29:05.600 --> 29:08.400
-I'm telling everybody. You all sucked.
-You only get pissed at me.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.040
-Is that clear?
-I'm sick of this crap.

29:10.120 --> 29:15.240
Wake up, guys!
You have to bust a gut, stay focused.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.800
Listen, Checco,
last time I was permissive

29:18.880 --> 29:20.520
but things have changed now

29:20.600 --> 29:23.400
and you'll work out like everyone else,
even if your name is Totti.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.520
And don't laugh.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.320
Come on. Let's start over.
Two kicks.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.160
Chanel, turn off that phone
and the lights, go to sleep.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.440
-Yes, in a minute.
-Not in a minute, now.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.400
He's devouring his nails.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.720
You go to bed too.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.160
Turn it off.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.440
-Come on.
-Okay.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.280
What's going on?

30:03.680 --> 30:04.960
They're butchering them.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.080
The guys in red?

30:10.240 --> 30:11.520
That's Liverpool.

30:13.640 --> 30:14.840
What about you?

30:17.840 --> 30:20.280
-What about me?
-What's going on with you?

30:21.080 --> 30:22.160
Nothing.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.200
-Let it go.
-No.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.200
He's on my case.
It seems I'm Roma's problem now.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.240
-Who? Luciano?
-Who else?

30:38.680 --> 30:42.120
He yells at me as if I were a little kid.
He's changed.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.600
He's like the jerk twin brother
of what he used to be.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.800
-What are you laughing at?
-"The jerk twin brother" made me laugh.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.040
Good for you.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.520
-Maybe something happened.
-How would I know?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.080
There must be a reason for it.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.120
It's all inside his head.
Nothing happened to me.

31:04.680 --> 31:09.280
Are you sure you never said
or did anything, without thinking...

31:09.960 --> 31:12.360
that might have hurt him,
that he took poorly?

31:12.440 --> 31:15.600
I would have told you.
I did nothing. It's all him.

31:16.880 --> 31:20.200
Come on, Fra', don't be childish.
You know how Luciano is.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.520
No, I don't know anymore.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.600
-The guy is touchy.
-I used to know.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.960
He's irritable, like you.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.840
I knew him back in the day,
now I don't anymore.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.920
Think about it.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.320
Honey, you're not sleeping?
What are you doing?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.160
I'm thinking about it.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.640
I thought and thought...

32:18.200 --> 32:19.240
There was one thing.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.760
THE DISMISSAL

32:20.920 --> 32:22.560
Last time they'd sent him packing...

32:23.520 --> 32:26.960
one of three times, in total

32:27.840 --> 32:29.440
without being able
to say anything...

32:32.520 --> 32:33.560
He was devastated.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.560
A year later, he did say something.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.160
Spalletti, a year ago
you resigned from Roma.

34:08.240 --> 34:11.480
Today, you won the Russian
championship with Zenit.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.680
Even Totti congratulates you.

34:13.760 --> 34:18.640
I thank him, maybe if he'd said
something to me when I left

34:18.720 --> 34:22.200
I would have preferred that,
but his compliments now are just as good.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.480
Thank you, thank you.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.480
-Now I know what happened.
-What happened?

34:32.560 --> 34:34.000
His mind is stuck in 2009.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.600
He's convinced I didn't take
his side against management.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.960
-That I had him fired.
-I told you I had a hunch.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.280
-I had forgotten all about it.
-So he's gonna be a jerk for a while.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.440
So what? We're in Rome.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.760
What, he'll go to war with you?
In your city? They will bulldoze him!

34:51.080 --> 34:53.800
Maybe he just needs to cool off.
What do you think?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.040
I think he came back to make you quit.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.040
Our great team captain.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.160
He's gorgeous.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.400
-He looks like a god.
-Great guy.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.400
Aren't you sweating?
You're like a sheep.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.800
Hey, let me through.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.720
-The hell are you doing?
-Hey!

35:33.800 --> 35:35.880
-Where do you think you're going?
-Let me through.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.840
The hell are you thinking?

35:38.000 --> 35:41.320
Do you know what I did to be here?
Do you have the faintest idea?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.160
Ten more days.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.360
-He did ten more days?
-Yeah, he's an idiot.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.520
Come here, then.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.480
Hurry up.

35:52.720 --> 35:55.600
That way you can leave.
Ten days are not a short time.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.760
-One more.
-One more?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.680
-Two more.
-We're going to make a photo album.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.240
Pipe down!

36:03.400 --> 36:05.400
"Pipe down," he says...

36:06.720 --> 36:07.760
Smile.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.720
Hey, Miss Universe,
you're busting everyone's balls.

36:11.920 --> 36:16.320
Captain, this is the best day in my life.
First you... and now I'm leaving.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.640
Aren't you happy?

36:17.720 --> 36:19.280
I swear I'll never end up
in here again.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.440
I'll come see you
every Sunday until I die.

36:23.480 --> 36:27.000
Don't think I'm going to last that long.
Let's take one last picture.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.640
What are you in for?

36:40.680 --> 36:41.800
What are you talking about?

36:43.600 --> 36:44.800
What are you talking about?

36:47.360 --> 36:49.120
Time goes by even out there,
you know?

36:51.280 --> 36:52.800
-I'm innocent.
-What?

36:52.880 --> 36:55.480
-I'm innocent.
-We better tell them.
