to overthrow the government.

Peter's death, Corinne's arrest,
Ingrid's arrival, it's all my fault.

13:06.120 --> 13:09.158
Jessica, don't be silly. None of that
has anything to do with you.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.751
No? Wherever I am, Mary,
there's death and destruction.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.839
It's always been that way.
Jessica, that's not true.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.555
You remember Mr. Rolo
and what happened to him?

13:18.800 --> 13:20.757
Mr. Rolo?
Yes, you remember.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.240
The clown that used to
entertain at all of our birthday
parties when we were little.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.679
Mr. Rolo.

Oh, Jessica, do you
remember Mr. Rolo?

13:31.440 --> 13:35.229
Well, Mary, obviously I do,
I just brought him up.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.315
I loved Mr. Rolo.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.517
And you remember
how at my birthday party,

13:40.720 --> 13:43.315
he just keeled over
and dropped dead on the spot?

13:45.280 --> 13:48.990
If I am not the kiss of death, Mary,
I don't know who is.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.793
Jessie, he was a sick man.

At my birthday party,
right in the middle of
his rabbit trick,

13:54.320 --> 13:58.280
he just turned blue and sunk
to the floor, dead as a doornail.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.554
The man had high blood pressure,
he weighed nearly 300 pounds.

As if that wasn't enough,
his dying,

14:05.240 --> 14:08.870

he fell on the rabbit and killed him.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.830
He did?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.720
Of course.
Don't you remember, Mary?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.560
When they were trying
to revive him, all you could see

14:17.760 --> 14:21.993
were those two little
white ears sticking out
from under his stomach.

Mr. Rolo and the rabbit died
at my birthday party.

No, it's Burt.

Well, if that is Burt, Mary,
I think you're probably a widow.

Those were shots.

No, he's just doing
some ballistics tests.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.792
He's trying to find
the murderer.

Well, Mary, if the murderer
ever was in your basement,

14:53.480 --> 14:56.393
I feel sure he would
have left by now.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.796
Burt's acting
a little strange lately.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.317
Oh, Mary, Burt's always
been slightly strange.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.760
No, no, it's more than that.
He's acting kind of, uh, crazy.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.998
Oh, I don't think you have
anything to worry about Mary.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.159
I mean, we both know Burt's
always been a little strange.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.591
That's what makes him
so adorable.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.271
I mean, he's just a sweet man
with a slightly jumpy personality,

15:22.480 --> 15:24.119

What are you doing?

My goodness! What are you doing?
Nothing.

It's such a problem. Hair.

Oh, it just clogs up the drain,
and then the plumber has to
come and remove it.

Have you ever seen
what they remove, Burt?
Oh, it's so disgusting.

It's no wonder
they charge so much.
