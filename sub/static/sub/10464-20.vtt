WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.350
Look, Claud, he probably just decided to
stay a couple extra days in Scottsdale.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.487
You know, to sightsee
or something.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.322
Anyway, are you sure
he even said Saturday?

00:13.346 --> 00:14.281
I don't remember that.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.440
Yes.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.201
'Cause when we went to
the nursery last week,

00:17.225 --> 00:18.828
they said that we could
come back Saturday

00:18.852 --> 00:20.037
and pick up all the seeds

00:20.061 --> 00:21.872
and plants that we would
need for the garden.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.582
And Grandpa said
that would be great,

00:23.606 --> 00:25.658
because that was the day
that he was coming home.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.578
Come to think of it, we were gonna
watch that fight on the pay-per-view.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.589
He said he had a
couple of bucks on it.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.666
Look, I know... I know you guys
probably don't wanna to hear this,

00:33.783 --> 00:36.377
but I think we should be
open to the possibility...

00:37.203 --> 00:38.755
That maybe this is it.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.590
For us.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.844
You know, maybe he just...
Split.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.105
No way.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.189
What do you mean split?

00:47.213 --> 00:48.765
I mean, he's had enough.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.059
And he's gone. Possibly.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.019
He's done it before.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.488
And think about it,

00:54.512 --> 00:56.898
we don't have a telephone
number where we can call him.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.443
When he goes away, he never
leaves us a phone number, right?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.747
And he said he was gonna
be back two days ago,

01:02.771 --> 01:04.415
and he's still not back. So...

01:04.438 --> 01:06.491
You really think we might
not see him again?

01:07.692 --> 01:09.660
I just have this weird feeling.
What if you're right?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.081
You guys, his stuff
is still here.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.791
So what?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.460
Do you think he... Do
you think he, like...

01:17.952 --> 01:19.972
Like, packed when he left Mom?

01:19.996 --> 01:22.725
No. He didn't. He just... He
took whatever he had with him,

01:22.749 --> 01:24.342
he got in his car,
and that was that.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.011
No.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.481
No, no, no. You're wrong.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.774
Something horrible happened.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.943
He, like... He, like, forgot his blood
pressure medication or something.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.445
Hey, calm down.
What are you doing?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.155
Um, can you please give
me all the numbers

01:36.179 --> 01:37.980
to all the hospitals in Arizona?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.357
Claudia.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.776
He wouldn't just leave.

01:42.685 --> 01:44.153
I know he wouldn't.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.077
Where's that dry-cleaning slip?

02:23.101 --> 02:25.204
I have this skimpy black
thing that's perfect.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.831
Although I don't wanna
look like a spokesmodel.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.041
I doubled up on wait staff,
and I triple ordered food.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.335
So he should get what he
ordered and get it fast.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.337
I just hope Terrell's not in
another one of his moods.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.047
So, do I write a
speech or don't I?

02:35.071 --> 02:37.498
Think I lost it last year
because I wrote a speech?

02:37.740 --> 02:39.301
Listen to me.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.470
It's the Bay Area
TV News Awards.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.838
They've got a category
for best weather.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.226
I wish I had you next to me to
help me make fun of it all.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.185
Look, Kathleen...

02:48.209 --> 02:49.343
Charlie.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.308
Don't apologize.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.685
You can't be there.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.104
I completely understand.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.825
Well, maybe Terrell
can do it alone.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.285
Now that I've got
everything in place.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.735
Don't be silly.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.788
You need everything
to be perfect.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.655
Critics only give
you one chance.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.782
You're not angry at me?

03:12.901 --> 03:15.870
You don't have to be
so careful, Charlie.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.915
I mean, I'm disappointed...

03:20.700 --> 03:22.084
But I do understand.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.629
'Cause I don't want you
thinking that I'm not trying.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.423
You've been great.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.426
So relax, okay?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.476
But, if you want extra credit,

03:39.552 --> 03:41.562
you could help me
pick an outfit.

03:48.019 --> 03:48.913
Grandpa?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.279
That would be me.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.573
- Boy, you're back.
- Yeah.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.993
Do you know what today is?

03:57.403 --> 03:58.756
Hello to you too, Bailey.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.831
You were supposed to be
back here three days ago.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.178
We called, like, 50 hospitals
in Scottsdale last night.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.972
They don't have 50
hospitals in Scottsdale.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.224
Claudia had nightmares.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.017
Just that one, Bay.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.228
Well, I didn't mean to
cause a riot or anything.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.929
It's just... My
meetings ran long.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.065
Did I miss something?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.485
Well, I picked up all the
stuff for the gardening.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.402
It's all in the shed.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.695
That reminds me.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.688
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. That's it?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.481
Now, this...

04:26.182 --> 04:28.285
Will keep your head
from baking in the sun.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.203
Oh, thanks.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.081
Hey, you should have called. "Hello,
I'm gonna be a few days late."

04:32.105 --> 04:34.792
What... What is so
difficult with that? Huh?

04:34.816 --> 04:37.086
Look, this... This is not a
bed-and-breakfast here. Okay?

04:37.110 --> 04:40.256
If you're gonna be, like,
gone, we're gonna notice.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.091
And we're gonna... We're gonna
worry and we're gonna think...

04:42.115 --> 04:45.084
Bailey, he said he was sorry,
and he's here. So just...

04:45.285 --> 04:46.711
Shut up already.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.880
I guess I'm not used to
anybody expecting me.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.426
But, uh, sorry.

04:54.919 --> 04:59.932
It won't happen again.
Okay? Bailey?

05:04.887 --> 05:06.022
Okay.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.987
So which is it gonna be?

05:13.521 --> 05:16.417
Gonna take the test like every
other bookworm, or you gonna...

05:16.441 --> 05:18.701
Get creative and
take option "B"?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.713
I'm just gonna take
the test, Justin.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.247
I don't have time to write
a whole folk tale thing.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.751
Well, we could do it together.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.461
It could be kind of fun.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.556
We could cook up
some crazy story

05:30.580 --> 05:32.474
about star-crossed
lovers on the run.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.051
I'd rather just take the test.
Get it over with, okay?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.814
You know, these stickers, I
never would have put 'em on

05:38.838 --> 05:40.399
if I'd known I'd have to
live with them for, like,

05:40.423 --> 05:42.266
the rest of my time
on the planet.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.188
<i>Once, there was a
couple named...</i>

05:47.805 --> 05:50.691
<i>Named Jersey and Geraldine.</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:53.078
<i>They'd been together so long,</i>

05:53.102 --> 05:55.946
<i>they could barely remember
a time when they weren't.</i>

05:56.439 --> 05:58.792
<i>But they remember the
moment they fell in love,</i>

05:58.816 --> 06:01.128
<i>because even though it
was a long time ago,</i>

06:01.152 --> 06:03.162
<i>it felt like yesterday to them.</i>

06:04.113 --> 06:06.467
<i>Or at least yesterday
it felt like yesterday</i>

06:06.491 --> 06:09.543
<i>because today they had
started to drift apart.</i>

06:10.203 --> 06:11.712
You know what it is, I just...

06:12.497 --> 06:14.224
I hate this room.

06:14.248 --> 06:17.061
It's all the same stuff. The...
The flowered rug,

06:17.085 --> 06:20.262
the little jewelry house,
the dried flowers,

06:20.713 --> 06:22.816
stupid animal stickers...

06:22.840 --> 06:26.769
<i>And Geraldine knew it was
all their house's fault.</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:29.698
<i>Because the old place
was full of problems,</i>

06:29.722 --> 06:33.025
<i>like the cracks that let in
the cold air in the winter</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.778
<i>and pipes that were so squeaky,</i>

06:35.895 --> 06:39.240
<i>they played the "Twilight
Zone Theme" every night.</i>

06:39.690 --> 06:42.618
<i>So they decided it was
time to move away.</i>

06:45.863 --> 06:49.218
Did you know that, uh, your
great-grandfather had a farm?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.336
And on his farm he had some ducks.
Right-o?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.050
Hey, Bay.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.677
Come on, dig in.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.815
I think your brother's
still mad at me.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.724
I may have to go to bed
tonight without my supper.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.518
Just come and help us, Bay.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.147
All right. Why not?

07:14.392 --> 07:17.403
Hey. It's kind of fun, huh?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.823
When was the last time we did
a family project out here?

07:21.315 --> 07:22.450
Uh,

07:23.276 --> 07:24.410
Charlie's wedding?

07:24.694 --> 07:27.496
Oh, nice. Nice, nice.
Thank you very much.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.675
Hey.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.592
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.668
No, wait a second.
Wait a second.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.171
- How sorry?
- No, don't even think...

07:37.623 --> 07:39.143
Oh! Hey, cut that out!

07:39.167 --> 07:40.509
Ugh!

07:41.627 --> 07:42.729
Back off!

07:42.753 --> 07:43.814
Cut it out!

07:43.838 --> 07:45.691
Claudia! Claudia!

07:45.715 --> 07:47.609
Oh, I dare you.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.735
You dare me?

07:48.759 --> 07:50.686
You dare me?

07:55.183 --> 07:57.077
Uncle! Uncle!

07:57.101 --> 07:59.246
What do you mean "Uncle"?
I'm your grandpa.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.863
You're all confused.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.782
Get back to work now.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.367
That guy's a drill sergeant.
Who knew?

08:08.779 --> 08:10.257
<i>Hi, leave a message</i>

08:10.281 --> 08:12.342
<i>and some Salinger or another
will get back to you. Promise.</i>

08:12.366 --> 08:14.210
<i>Hi, um,</i>

08:14.952 --> 08:16.921
<i>I'm trying to reach Jake Gordon.</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:19.099
<i>Maybe this isn't
the right number.</i>

08:19.123 --> 08:20.591
<i>Uh, I don't know
whose house this is.</i>

08:21.459 --> 08:23.052
<i>If he is here...</i>

08:23.544 --> 08:26.013
<i>Could you tell him that...
That Lauren called?</i>

08:28.132 --> 08:29.558
Hi, sweetheart?

08:31.928 --> 08:35.157
There's room on that top shelf up there.
Can you get me the chair?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.073
Yeah.

08:36.097 --> 08:37.618
<i>so Jersey and Geraldine</i>

08:37.642 --> 08:39.620
<i>started packing away
their old things.</i>

08:39.644 --> 08:40.703
You want me to do it? I can...

08:40.727 --> 08:43.364
No, that's... It's okay.
Just don't let me fall.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.460
<i>There was the head
of the unicorn</i>

08:46.484 --> 08:47.920
<i>he killed to impress her,</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:50.913
<i>not knowing it was her
favorite flying horse,</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:08.848
What was that about?

09:10.466 --> 09:11.600
What was...

09:12.677 --> 09:13.811
I don't...

09:14.095 --> 09:15.239
It was about...

09:15.263 --> 09:17.273
Being close to
you, I don't know.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.899
It's been a while.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.278
I just miss kissing you.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.742
Okay, uh...

09:29.318 --> 09:31.996
I've got stuff I
need to bring down.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.884
<i>But when they checked
under their bed</i>

09:35.908 --> 09:37.960
<i>to make sure they'd
packed everything,</i>

09:37.994 --> 09:40.045
<i>they found something strange.</i>

09:40.162 --> 09:42.099
<i>There, behind the missing socks,</i>

09:42.123 --> 09:44.383
<i>a thick, ugly weed was growing.</i>

09:44.667 --> 09:46.061
<i>And they knew from its size</i>

09:46.085 --> 09:48.262
<i>that it must have
been there a while.</i>

09:49.338 --> 09:51.432
Okay, okay, that's true, but...

09:52.091 --> 09:53.360
He did have three desserts,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.644
and he was writing
the whole time.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.480
He hardly touched
the tuna tartar.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.617
I knew the cilantro
was a mistake.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.827
How could he finish
all those dishes?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.161
I mean, he ordered
half the menu.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.288
Well, he had to.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.323
With Jason clearing the
plates every five seconds.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.699
Well,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.284
I thought we did pretty well.

10:10.985 --> 10:11.878
I did.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.121
I mean, except for the
tuna, didn't you?

10:15.531 --> 10:16.665
Hello?

10:17.825 --> 10:18.959
Claudia?

10:19.577 --> 10:20.846
Now? I forgot... I
forgot all about it.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.004
What channel is it?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.131
Okay, bye.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.519
<i>...and, of course my entire...</i>

10:27.543 --> 10:30.897
Oh, my God, she won.
Charlie, she won.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.181
<i>Success like this...</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:35.559
<i>God, this thing is heavy.</i>

10:36.427 --> 10:38.103
<i>You don't get this on your own.</i>

10:38.888 --> 10:42.191
<i>You need people who are
willing to back you up</i>

10:42.683 --> 10:47.873
<i>and give you the room to learn and...
And to make mistakes.</i>

10:47.897 --> 10:49.082
<i>So,</i>

10:49.106 --> 10:51.867
<i>uh, well, Charlie,</i>

10:52.234 --> 10:53.619
<i>I love you.</i>

11:10.294 --> 11:11.438
<i>Hi, leave a message</i>

11:11.462 --> 11:14.223
<i>and some Salinger or another
will get back to you. Promise.</i>

11:14.423 --> 11:16.276
<i>Hi, this is Dr.
Reichman's office.</i>

11:16.300 --> 11:19.978
<i>Just a reminder, Claudia has a checkup
and a cleaning tomorrow at 4:00.</i>

11:22.223 --> 11:23.524
<i> Hi, um,</i>

11:24.225 --> 11:26.193
<i>I'm trying to reach Jake Gordon.</i>

11:26.685 --> 11:28.580
<i>Maybe this isn't
the right number.</i>

11:28.604 --> 11:30.155
<i>Uh, I don't know
whose house this is.</i>

11:30.731 --> 11:32.491
<i>If he is here...</i>

11:32.858 --> 11:35.160
<i>Could you tell him that...
That Lauren called?</i>

11:36.237 --> 11:37.996
<i> Hi, sweetheart?</i>

11:38.280 --> 11:39.257
<i> Is it you?</i>

11:39.281 --> 11:40.801
<i>Lauren, my God!</i>

11:40.825 --> 11:43.303
<i>I got this number from Benny.
I hope that's okay.</i>

11:43.327 --> 11:45.838
<i>Sure. Sure, it is. Uh...</i>

11:45.996 --> 11:48.424
<i>I'm just staying
with friends here.</i>

11:48.749 --> 11:49.810
<i>Are you all right?</i>

11:49.834 --> 11:51.260
<i>I have some good news.</i>

11:52.128 --> 11:53.804
<i>I'm getting married, Daddy.</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:01.353
So that was, like, the
first time, right?

12:01.679 --> 12:02.572
Your name was on TV?

12:02.596 --> 12:04.825
And it wasn't even
<i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:06.316
You know what it's like?

12:07.017 --> 12:09.162
It's like that guy, you
know, the one who, um,

12:09.186 --> 12:12.290
in the paper, how he
proposed to his girlfriend

12:12.314 --> 12:14.000
on that big light thing
in Candlestick Park.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.210
Yeah, so romantic.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.202
And right out there
for everyone to see.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.580
Too bad you weren't at
the awards, huh, Char?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.258
I mean,

12:21.282 --> 12:23.802
that would have been,
like, wow, right?

12:23.826 --> 12:25.836
Yeah, Claud, it's too bad.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.214
Hey, Kathleen.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.644
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:32.668 --> 12:33.728
Have you guys seen yet?

12:33.752 --> 12:34.646
Are you in there?

12:34.670 --> 12:35.804
Nope.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.431
You are.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.317
- A review that quick?
- Mmm-hmm.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.236
- Wow! Cool.
- No way.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.237
I wanna see, Char.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.321
Read out loud, Charlie.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.614
Charlie, stop!

12:44.638 --> 12:45.856
Let us see.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.610
Whoa, this is...

12:50.311 --> 12:51.445
This is good.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.823
They mentioned Terrell, spelled
his name right, thank God.

12:55.316 --> 12:59.337
Oh, listen to this, "The seafood
bisque was electric with flavor."

12:59.361 --> 13:00.380
Oh, lemme see. I wanna see.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.923
We're gonna have to get
like a bunch of these

13:01.947 --> 13:03.049
for the window at
the restaurant.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.384
And Joe's gonna want one too.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.626
Joe will want 10.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.554
Can you guys run out
and get some of these?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.963
Oh, sure. Come on, Claud,
before they sell out.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.173
Congratulations.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.720
So... Quite a night
for both of us.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.274
Yeah.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.683
That was a sweet
message you left me.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.313
Only you didn't say
anything about my speech.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.025
I'm sorry. Um,

13:30.142 --> 13:32.329
it just got so... With
what's-his-face and all.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.788
By the time I looked at
the clock, it was...

13:33.812 --> 13:35.697
Don't worry. No big deal.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.658
I... I have a tape.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.175
Interesting idea,
a thrift store.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.510
Yeah, well, you know,

13:46.534 --> 13:49.054
the cheaper you buy, the
more you can get, you know.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.722
I mean, why just
move things around?

13:50.746 --> 13:51.765
Go whole hog.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.173
Change your whole
room, you know.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.926
This raccoon, for instance,

13:56.585 --> 13:57.886
in your room,

13:58.337 --> 14:00.889
would make a very big change.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.183
Put that away. It's disgusting.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.188
All right, fine.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.607
Hey, what about this?

14:11.642 --> 14:15.247
- "1953 Alameda County
Champions." - Yeah.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.573
What for... For my room?

14:18.023 --> 14:21.002
They were the best girl's
archery team in the county.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.045
So?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.579
I don't know, I mean,

14:23.737 --> 14:25.414
when this picture was taken,

14:25.698 --> 14:29.459
these girls were having, like,
the best year of their lives.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.795
I mean, look at their faces.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.048
Isn't it fun to imagine
what they're thinkin'?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.094
I'm actually kinda
serious about this.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.471
I don't even know where
Alameda County is.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.057
It's across the bay.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.944
All right, fine. It's a
bad idea, you're right.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.654
Don't do that. Just
because I don't like it,

14:47.678 --> 14:49.197
doesn't mean it's a bad idea.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.240
Okay, it's a good idea.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.492
Great, Justin. Just agree
with everything I say.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.785
You're gonna get
pissed off either way,

14:53.809 --> 14:55.152
- so it doesn't...
- No, I'm not.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.997
<i>They yanked at the weed,</i>

14:57.021 --> 14:59.031
<i>they hacked it and burned it,</i>

14:59.106 --> 15:02.168
<i>they even tried feeding it
Jersey's worst borscht,</i>

15:02.192 --> 15:04.077
<i>the one that killed
Uncle Traugott.</i>

15:04.403 --> 15:06.131
<i>But every time the
weed came back,</i>

15:06.155 --> 15:07.956
<i>even stronger than before.</i>

15:38.646 --> 15:39.780
Excuse me.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.124
Excuse me, Miss Gordon?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.282
Uh, yes?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.159
Hi, um...

15:45.903 --> 15:48.872
I'm... Uh... This is...

15:49.114 --> 15:51.092
Uh, how do you know my name?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.135
Who are you?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.919
Uh, Bailey. Salinger.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.004
You... You... You called your...
Your father

15:56.789 --> 15:58.507
at my house yesterday.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.092
Oh.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.896
Um, I think that...

16:02.920 --> 16:05.389
That we're kind of
related, you and me.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.060
I guess I always knew that...

16:11.053 --> 16:12.604
That there was some...

16:13.597 --> 16:15.190
Thing. I...

16:16.392 --> 16:19.444
I found a picture once of a little girl.
I asked him about it.

16:20.729 --> 16:21.989
He wouldn't...

16:22.606 --> 16:24.783
Can I ask you, um...

16:25.985 --> 16:27.911
And this... This might be too...

16:29.863 --> 16:31.999
Was... Was he there for you?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.127
I mean, like, was he...
Was he a real dad?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.797
When he was around,
yeah, he was, um...

16:39.915 --> 16:40.892
Sure, yes.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.301
Yes, but...

16:43.502 --> 16:44.604
You know...

16:44.628 --> 16:46.847
It was always a year
here, a year gone.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.808
Maybe two years gone.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.154
He'd send postcards and...
And checks.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.230
He did that. And then...

16:55.973 --> 16:57.117
And then, one day
out of the blue,

16:57.141 --> 17:00.777
you'd hear this key in the
door, and it would be, um...

17:01.562 --> 17:03.248
It would be, "Hi, here I am."

17:03.272 --> 17:06.407
All smiles and happy,
with presents and...

17:07.859 --> 17:09.077
Yeah.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.830
I got into this habit
when I was little.

17:14.324 --> 17:19.003
Anytime he'd go anywhere, to the
grocery, to play cards, whatever...

17:20.580 --> 17:23.508
I'd always say, "I love
you very much, Daddy."

17:25.335 --> 17:28.137
In case that was gonna be the
last time I'd ever see him.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.768
I always think it
might be, you know.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.731
I thought that...

17:38.849 --> 17:40.192
Twenty minutes ago.

17:42.644 --> 17:47.908
But... All that... That letting
you down and all that...

17:48.442 --> 17:52.954
Stuff, and... And you still
want him to be in your wedding?

17:54.073 --> 17:57.084
Hey, you took him in. You
knew what he was like.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.837
I guess we take what
we can get, huh?

18:02.748 --> 18:03.882
I guess.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.639
So did you read it?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.641
Mmm-hmm. Just finished.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.560
Well, so did I.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.145
Wanna take a look?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.787
So that's all you're gonna
say, that you finished it?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.029
I liked it. I thought
it was good.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.916
How come I don't believe you?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.834
I didn't say I don't
have any problems.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.295
Okay, problems. That's why
I gave it to you to read.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.537
Tell me your problems.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.330
So go ahead, beat me up.
I'm ready.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.802
Well, I liked the
thing about the weed.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.430
I mean, that was a good, you
know, symbol or whatever.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.890
But the way they get rid of it.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.852
They accidentally find a potion
that magically makes it go away?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.312
That's kind of dumb.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.971
Can't you do better than that?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.446
What? What was it you
wanted to show me?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.604
It looks the same.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.106
Look up.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.826
I just thought...

19:13.318 --> 19:16.872
You could lie in bed and imagine
you're looking up at the stars.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.416
It might make you feel better.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.138
You gotta be kidding me, right?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.630
I mean, it's sweet you
doing this, but...

19:27.291 --> 19:29.759
It's still just plastic
on the ceiling, you know.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.184
I'll take 'em down.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.687
And she's insisting that
we drive up this weekend.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.147
I told her maybe Sunday.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.108
Maybe, but not to count on it,

19:45.142 --> 19:46.610
that we're really busy.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.374
That's what happens when your
mother sees you on live TV

19:51.398 --> 19:53.283
announcing that you're in love.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.912
Kathleen, um...

19:58.071 --> 19:59.247
I'm...

20:00.199 --> 20:01.875
I'm not a very good liar.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.679
What? When did you lie?

20:04.703 --> 20:06.973
About your speech and
why I missed it.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.759
It wasn't because I was too
busy or I forgot or anything.

20:12.878 --> 20:17.641
Um, what happened is, uh...

20:18.800 --> 20:23.605
Last night, right when we were
closing up, Kirsten came by.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.776
I was, uh... It was...

20:28.143 --> 20:30.904
I mean, completely
out of nowhere.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.697
So, what did she...

20:33.607 --> 20:35.075
Why did she come to see you?

20:39.363 --> 20:41.915
She wants to get back
together with you, is that...

20:42.199 --> 20:45.335
Yeah, she kinda does.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.046
Do you?

20:49.331 --> 20:51.841
Well, I... I don't know.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.344
I don't know what to do.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.264
'Cause this is... This is...

20:57.339 --> 20:59.933
This really matters
to me, you know, us.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.364
But, um, Kirsten
and me, we were...

21:04.388 --> 21:06.690
We were two seconds away
from getting married.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.278
I hate doing this...

21:11.603 --> 21:15.156
To you, but... I think that
I kinda owe it to her...

21:16.984 --> 21:18.118
To try.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.705
Oh, uh...

21:23.573 --> 21:24.874
This is, uh...

21:26.034 --> 21:28.003
Oh, this is, uh,

21:28.453 --> 21:30.630
this is... Oh, boy.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.685
I wasn't expecting this.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.843
I know.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.886
I know, and I'm...

21:38.130 --> 21:40.473
I'm really, really
sorry, Kathleen.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.892
You deserve...

21:43.468 --> 21:45.687
Just everything.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.247
Ooh, look, how pretty.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.164
Mmm.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.198
Hmm. Snapdragons.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.117
Can we put in some of these?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.130
Well, angel, I think we'll
have to wait till summer

22:02.154 --> 22:04.664
to plant those, but
let's save that.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.219
Claudia,

22:08.243 --> 22:10.253
Owen's ready for his bath.
It's your turn.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.172
He looked pretty clean to me.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.141
Claudia.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.549
Nice try.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.134
Worth a shot.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.693
Well, I might as
well hit the hay.

22:23.717 --> 22:24.934
No, wait.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.686
Wait a second.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.772
I want you to go.

22:29.973 --> 22:32.067
You have to leave. You
can't stay here anymore.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.235
What are you talking about?

22:34.561 --> 22:35.987
I saw you today...

22:36.938 --> 22:38.198
With your daughter.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.533
- I know.
- No.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.327
You don't know.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.715
Lauren has nothing
to do with you.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.925
Nothing. That's
entirely separate.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.084
What?

22:50.243 --> 22:51.711
Who are you?

22:51.787 --> 22:55.590
Do you... Do you actually
think that that's acceptable?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.894
You have one family,
and you dump them,

22:57.918 --> 22:59.479
and then you have a
whole other family.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.897
Will you let me explain?

23:00.921 --> 23:03.932
No. No, I don't want to hear
anything you have to say, okay?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.818
It's probably just a
bunch of lies, anyway.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.228
Oh, Bailey, please
don't do this.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.438
Everything here is pretty good.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.034
We've all been
getting on so well.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.192
For how long?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.195
Huh? How long will that last?

23:17.521 --> 23:18.956
Well, I can't predict...

23:18.980 --> 23:20.792
No. See, no. I can't, okay?

23:20.816 --> 23:23.586
I can't sit around here
and let them love you,

23:23.610 --> 23:25.120
while I'm just waiting.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.330
Just waiting...

23:40.627 --> 23:42.554
The two wedding rings.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.274
Remember, Claud, that story?

23:45.298 --> 23:47.183
He said he lost one of them.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.352
We never even...

23:49.719 --> 23:52.063
How stupid was that,
to believe him?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.117
Man, I didn't see this comin'.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.192
And now you gotta
think, what else?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.486
You know, I mean, everything's
up for grabs now.

23:58.728 --> 24:01.698
These trips that he takes,
what's that about, huh?

24:02.274 --> 24:04.909
You know what? Who cares? It
doesn't even matter, because...

24:05.402 --> 24:07.120
Because I told him
he's gotta leave.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.548
You what?

24:08.572 --> 24:09.789
I kicked him out.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.384
'Cause he had another kid once?

24:11.408 --> 24:12.844
What does that have
to do with us?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.804
Bay, you don't just go off and
make a decision like that...

24:14.828 --> 24:18.015
God, Mom never sees him
again, never hears from him

24:18.039 --> 24:20.268
and he just goes off
and replaces her.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.303
And... And he bails on
his second family too.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.264
And the thing is that...
That this girl, Lauren?

24:27.340 --> 24:28.317
She has that look.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.319
You know the look that Mom
used to get sometimes

24:30.343 --> 24:31.904
when you'd look at
her and you'd think,

24:31.928 --> 24:33.406
man, somebody must've
hurt you so much.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.690
Well, Lauren has that same look.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.494
And, Claudia, I do not want
that to be you someday.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.069
You're... You're just jealous.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.498
- What?
- You're just jealous

24:42.522 --> 24:43.624
because he does stuff with me.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.127
He kinda takes care of me now. Maybe
I don't need you as much any more.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.254
Claudia, that is not why
I'm doing this, okay?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.923
There are danger signs here.
It's like flashing lights.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.551
Come on, you guys. Everything
you're talking about, that's...

24:53.575 --> 24:56.137
That's old news. It
happened a long time ago.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.054
Yeah.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.264
He hasn't done
anything bad to us.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.839
- Yet.
- No.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.050
I think you're wrong, Bay.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.093
He is here.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.803
And it feels real.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.223
And I don't know, maybe...

25:08.548 --> 25:09.775
Maybe it's selfish or something,

25:09.799 --> 25:11.777
but it gives me a big
break having him around.

25:11.801 --> 25:15.573
Okay, well, what happens next
time he's late a week or a month?

25:15.597 --> 25:18.566
How can you trust him after
all of this, Charlie?

25:18.642 --> 25:19.776
I don't.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.861
He loves us. I know it.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.738
That...

25:24.689 --> 25:26.375
That's gotta count
for something.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.835
Sure. Sure, it does.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.587
Claudia, it does. But can
you guarantee me that

25:29.611 --> 25:31.996
he's not going to pull some
disappearing act on us?

25:32.489 --> 25:33.623
Huh?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.377
Who wants to risk that?

25:38.036 --> 25:39.254
Not me.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.547
Not me.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.269
<i>Geraldine and Jersey
were old and wise,</i>

25:54.302 --> 25:55.863
<i>but there was someone
in their land</i>

25:55.887 --> 25:58.731
<i>who was wiser and plenty older.</i>

25:58.890 --> 26:00.701
<i>Some people thought
she was ugly.</i>

26:00.725 --> 26:02.912
<i>Others thought the warts
gave her character,</i>

26:02.936 --> 26:05.331
<i>but everybody knew
The Answer Hag</i>

26:05.355 --> 26:07.031
<i>lived up to her name.</i>

26:07.107 --> 26:09.460
<i>Answer Hag told
Geraldine and Jersey</i>

26:09.484 --> 26:11.712
<i>that if there was any
magic that could solve</i>

26:11.736 --> 26:13.005
<i>their weed problem,</i>

26:13.029 --> 26:15.415
<i>it wasn't something
she could give them.</i>

26:15.448 --> 26:17.458
<i>It was something
they already had,</i>

26:17.617 --> 26:18.928
<i>or used to have.</i>

26:18.952 --> 26:21.170
<i>And it was right
under their noses.</i>

26:21.413 --> 26:22.932
<i>Something bigger
than an air kiss,</i>

26:22.956 --> 26:26.217
<i>but smaller than the La-Z-Boy
she made him throw away.</i>

26:26.293 --> 26:27.937
<i>And they wouldn't
know what it was</i>

26:27.961 --> 26:30.138
<i>until it came along
and bit them.</i>

26:31.047 --> 26:32.566
Look, I'm not... Don't
get me wrong here.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.851
I'm not saying that it was a
great thing to have done.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.562
Probably could have
handled it better,

26:38.096 --> 26:40.356
But... I was stuck.

26:40.598 --> 26:41.733
It was...

26:43.560 --> 26:44.944
Okay, yeah.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.163
It was a lie.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.698
A big, big, bald-faced lie.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.752
But what did you want me to do?
What was I gonna do?

26:51.776 --> 26:54.037
I didn't wanna completely
devastate her.

26:54.654 --> 26:55.788
It's like today.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.750
I saw you trying to get away from
that girl during cookies and milk.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.970
And maybe you're gonna have
to make up some story,

27:00.994 --> 27:02.462
tell her that you're...
You're...

27:02.704 --> 27:05.465
Lactose-intolerant. I don't know.
Something.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.520
'Cause you gotta look
out for yourself, O,

27:09.544 --> 27:11.262
but you've also gotta
look out for her.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.030
<i>Hi, it's Kirsten.</i>

28:01.054 --> 28:03.783
<i>I'm sorry I missed your call, but
I'm out of town until the 22nd.</i>

28:03.807 --> 28:04.867
<i>I'll be checking in though,</i>

28:04.891 --> 28:06.327
<i>so please leave your
name and number</i>

28:06.351 --> 28:07.735
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

28:17.862 --> 28:19.997
How long have you
been sitting here?

28:21.908 --> 28:23.084
I'm just...

28:24.327 --> 28:25.795
Tryin', Julia.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.631
And that's all I'm doin'.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.718
Tryin' and tryin'.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.397
Justin...

28:34.421 --> 28:35.555
You?

28:37.507 --> 28:38.975
You're not doing anything.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.314
And ever since the...

28:46.474 --> 28:48.776
Thing that we can't
talk about happened...

28:49.310 --> 28:50.528
The baby.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.491
I've been there for you.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.245
To talk if you wanted to talk,

28:59.904 --> 29:02.999
and when you went away that
time, and you didn't tell me?

29:03.199 --> 29:04.625
I let it go.

29:05.994 --> 29:09.172
But now, it's like... You
never even came back.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.301
And what happened, it happened.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.553
And it sucked.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.972
And we both feel bad about it.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.226
But we gotta try.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.478
Because...

29:24.012 --> 29:27.356
We don't laugh, we
don't, uh, kiss...

29:28.224 --> 29:30.735
And I'm not even talking
about sleeping together.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.197
I mean the... The simple
stuff, like, uh...

29:35.857 --> 29:37.241
Like holding hands.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.412
We don't do any of it.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.001
So, um...

29:48.328 --> 29:51.464
Here's the thing, uh, there
is a school dance...

29:51.915 --> 29:55.802
Tomorrow and I would
like us to go.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.846
And I know it's dorky, but...

29:59.714 --> 30:01.015
I don't care.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.729
Don't even answer if
you're not gonna say yes.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.107
Because, otherwise...

30:10.934 --> 30:13.569
Otherwise, this
isn't gonna work.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.364
Us.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.616
It's not gonna work.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.498
Okay.

30:38.628 --> 30:39.762
Hey.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.306
You thirsty?

30:43.842 --> 30:44.976
No.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.562
Can I help?

30:52.308 --> 30:53.651
I did it for you.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.988
And I know you don't get
that, but it's true.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.200
And I know what the
deal is, I know

31:01.484 --> 31:04.078
that you wanted some
wonderful grandfather.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.914
Like... Like <i>Heidi.</i>

31:07.240 --> 31:09.667
Or those <i>Waltons'</i> reruns.
We all did.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.502
But that's not Jake.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.422
Claudia.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.383
I'm only gonna say this once.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.603
I'm not talking to you anymore.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.095
Yeah. Yes...

31:21.629 --> 31:23.681
You will. I don't know
when, but you will.

31:25.008 --> 31:28.644
Because you're gonna want...
A ride somewhere.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.937
Or...

31:30.305 --> 31:32.575
Or you'll need to say,
"Pass the butter." Or...

31:32.599 --> 31:33.951
Or you'll hear some stupid joke

31:33.975 --> 31:35.818
that you'll wanna tell
me and you know what?

31:36.936 --> 31:38.070
Claudia.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.822
Claudia, listen to me!

31:41.399 --> 31:42.575
You know what?

31:42.984 --> 31:44.920
When you decide that you
wanna talk to me again,

31:44.944 --> 31:46.078
I'll be here.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.040
I'll be here, and...

31:49.866 --> 31:51.459
And he never would have stayed.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.544
Oh, you know everything now?

31:54.662 --> 31:55.796
You're God?

31:56.623 --> 31:59.175
What if you're wrong?
Look how much I lose.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.887
And you're the one who's taking
it away from me, not him.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.724
You.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.283
You come to run me out
of San Francisco?

32:25.193 --> 32:27.504
Town's not big enough
for both of us?

32:27.528 --> 32:28.663
No.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.248
No, I just...

32:31.991 --> 32:35.294
I just wanted to make sure of
everything, you know? I mean...

32:35.954 --> 32:37.932
I mean, I told you to
leave, and you did,

32:37.956 --> 32:39.924
but... But you and I never...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.551
Got to... We never...

32:42.669 --> 32:43.803
Come on in.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.025
I don't know what
you want from me.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.236
Okay, see.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.238
See, here's the thing.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.159
Losing people is kind of...

33:07.485 --> 33:09.620
Kind of a sore spot
for all of us.

33:10.571 --> 33:13.833
And having you around
the house was...

33:14.325 --> 33:15.459
It's been...

33:15.868 --> 33:17.003
Kind of like...

33:17.912 --> 33:20.381
It's been almost like
having a parent again.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.133
Which has been great.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.019
It's been really great, but...

33:24.043 --> 33:26.804
But really scary because
of your track record.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.350
Am I wrong about you?

33:37.640 --> 33:38.617
Say...

33:38.641 --> 33:41.110
Say something, damn it!
Gimme something!

33:41.352 --> 33:42.486
Here...

33:43.104 --> 33:44.289
I'm serious.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.958
I need you to tell
me if I'm wrong!

33:45.982 --> 33:47.116
Because...

33:47.692 --> 33:49.702
Because, God, I am...
I am making

33:49.861 --> 33:51.547
this huge decision
for everybody.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.674
And if I'm making a mistake,
then they all get hurt,

33:53.698 --> 33:56.208
and that's my fault.
That's on me.

34:05.251 --> 34:08.219
When I was married to your
grandmother, all those years,

34:08.504 --> 34:11.849
whenever I felt trapped, I'd...

34:12.216 --> 34:18.230
Get into the car and I would drive
somewhere, anywhere, for an hour or two

34:18.514 --> 34:19.899
and come back...

34:21.768 --> 34:23.360
And try again.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.534
That last time, I kept
telling myself...

34:31.235 --> 34:34.371
"Jake, turn this car
around and go home."

34:35.239 --> 34:36.748
But I couldn't.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.670
That's what happened.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.466
That's what happens.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.514
You're a pretty good judge
of character, Bailey.

34:54.382 --> 34:55.684
And I'm sorry.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.358
I am too.

35:07.396 --> 35:10.574
I want you to know that you'll
still be taken care of.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.202
For college.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.042
Don't... Don't disappear, okay?

35:22.411 --> 35:26.590
Um, write us or
call when you can.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.179
I will.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.265
And, uh...

35:35.883 --> 35:37.393
And if anything ever...

35:38.469 --> 35:41.063
Happens to you. You
know, if ever...

35:42.515 --> 35:44.316
Maybe somebody can call us.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.445
Uh, you wanna know when I die?

35:49.105 --> 35:51.031
I just don't want to be
wondering all the time.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.338
<i>So Geraldine and Jersey
searched everywhere</i>

35:56.362 --> 35:57.997
<i>for the thing that was missing.</i>

35:58.364 --> 36:01.459
<i>Was it the ancient shoes that
he wore to their wedding?</i>

36:02.743 --> 36:04.847
<i>Was it the lock of her
hair that she gave him</i>

36:04.871 --> 36:06.338
<i>when they were engaged?</i>

36:07.623 --> 36:09.175
<i>It was none of these.</i>

36:10.251 --> 36:11.311
<i>And then one day,</i>

36:11.335 --> 36:13.480
<i>while they were searching
the house separately,</i>

36:13.504 --> 36:17.016
<i>Geraldine and Jersey met in a
hallway and couldn't get by.</i>

36:17.967 --> 36:20.102
<i>When he moved left,
she moved right,</i>

36:20.845 --> 36:23.022
<i>and when she moved
left, he moved right.</i>

36:23.181 --> 36:26.192
<i>And pretty soon, they realized
that they were dancing.</i>

36:27.310 --> 36:28.986
<i>And it made them laugh.</i>

36:29.478 --> 36:32.916
<i>And when they laughed, they heard the
house shake with a strange noise,</i>

36:32.940 --> 36:35.659
<i>almost like it was
laughing with them.</i>

36:37.028 --> 36:38.755
<i>They went downstairs and saw</i>

36:38.779 --> 36:40.507
<i>that the noise was
the giant weed</i>

36:40.531 --> 36:42.050
<i>getting sucked
through the floor,</i>

36:42.074 --> 36:44.251
<i>inhaled back into the earth.</i>

36:44.911 --> 36:46.295
<i>And the more they laughed,</i>

36:46.495 --> 36:48.506
<i>the faster the weed went away.</i>

36:52.126 --> 36:55.012
Here you go. He loves to swing.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.555
Hmm.

37:01.093 --> 37:04.448
We're not going to see
you anymore, are we?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.940
Well, sure.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.108
Sure, you are.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.611
Here and there.

37:11.687 --> 37:14.156
This isn't goodbye or anything.

37:17.568 --> 37:20.005
She was 10, right?

37:20.029 --> 37:21.330
Mmm-hmm.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.874
When you...

37:25.076 --> 37:26.585
When I left.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.134
I was 10 when she died.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.263
Hmm.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.306
So we knew her the same amount.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.644
You know things that I'll
never know about her.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.774
And I know lots of
stuff that you don't.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.155
I guess I just
thought that, um...

37:57.441 --> 37:59.702
That there was gonna
be time where...

38:01.821 --> 38:03.622
We could tell each other.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.711
So, what if...

38:11.289 --> 38:13.507
What if I tell you,
like, everything?

38:15.626 --> 38:17.511
All the stuff that
I know about her.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.224
Will you tell me?

38:24.176 --> 38:25.311
Deal.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.789
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.761
We're gonna have to get out
there sooner or later.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.347
Better this song than,
like, the Bee Gees.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.013
Um, I'm sorry.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.100
What's wrong?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.395
I don't know. I don't know.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.574
Is it the music? We could
wait if you wanna wait.

39:52.598 --> 39:53.899
No, um...

39:55.476 --> 39:57.069
I don't feel like it.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.447
I want to, but I... I don't.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.661
- Julia...
- I just... I don't.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.897
Not to be, uh, too pushy, but...

40:34.223 --> 40:35.774
I need my key back.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.995
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

40:39.019 --> 40:40.789
That's the thing
about relationships,

40:40.813 --> 40:42.749
one day you're
exchanging house keys,

40:42.773 --> 40:44.575
the next you're
changing your locks.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.371
And I don't wanna
change my locks, so...

40:58.622 --> 40:59.757
So...

41:00.207 --> 41:02.426
One last drink for
<i>auld lang syne?</i>

41:04.086 --> 41:07.473
I would, but, uh, I kinda
have to meet Kirsten, so...

41:08.174 --> 41:10.142
You can stop that now, you know?

41:10.926 --> 41:14.396
Because I know that you're
not meeting Kirsten.

41:15.222 --> 41:18.525
I called. She's out of
town until the 22nd.

41:21.520 --> 41:25.167
Kathleen...

41:25.191 --> 41:28.628
I guess you wanted to
spare my feelings.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.538
Uh, whatever your reasons, uh...

41:32.072 --> 41:35.584
Anyway, uh, I appreciate
the kindness.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.002
I do.

41:37.244 --> 41:38.221
God. I feel like such a...

41:38.245 --> 41:39.963
No, no. Just stop.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.642
I... I want you to go on.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.260
Go live your life, and...

41:46.086 --> 41:50.390
I'm gonna go back to focusing on the
things in my life that I do well.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.727
Dating, obviously, not
being one of them.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.482
I don't know how many times I
have to say it, but this...

41:59.058 --> 42:02.736
Us not working out and all, it
has nothing to do with you.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.530
It's me. It's my fault.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.503
And I know I owe you money,

42:09.527 --> 42:10.837
and I promise we'll
work out a schedule

42:10.861 --> 42:12.631
for me to pay you back 'cause
I don't want you to think...

42:12.655 --> 42:14.414
That's not gonna be necessary.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.043
Besides, it might be
a little difficult.

42:18.577 --> 42:21.088
I don't think so. I mean, the
restaurant's doing great.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.091
I'd like to think I had
something to do with that.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.592
You did.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.344
A lot.

42:28.587 --> 42:29.805
I've, um...

42:31.131 --> 42:34.184
Been thinking about that,
actually, and, uh,

42:34.969 --> 42:38.031
just because you and I
aren't together anymore,

42:38.055 --> 42:40.116
that doesn't mean that I
should give up something

42:40.140 --> 42:43.443
that I've put so much time
and energy and money into.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.114
I've put together an
investment group.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.032
We're buying the whole building.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.411
I know it's a good
location for a restaurant.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.247
Not necessarily your
restaurant, but...

42:56.115 --> 42:57.008
What?

42:57.032 --> 42:59.793
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't
expect my lease to be renewed.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.473
But you've got what, three months?
So that should...

43:03.497 --> 43:04.631
This is...

43:04.999 --> 43:06.133
This is...

43:09.420 --> 43:11.305
Why are you doing this?

43:12.548 --> 43:13.765
Charlie.

43:14.049 --> 43:16.268
This has nothing to do with you.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.438
Huh.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.357
And it sounded so true
when you said it.

43:23.934 --> 43:25.152
Oh...
