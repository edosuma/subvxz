[urinating and sighing]

02:05.520 --> 02:07.160
Elishia, it's me. Where are you?

02:08.200 --> 02:10.560
You have got no right to keep them
hidden from me. Call me back.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.360
[mobile phone beeps]

[mobile phone chimes]

[clicks mouse]

02:33.800 --> 02:35.920
-Work or porn?
-Porn.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.280
-Ugh.
-Always porn.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.880
-[chuckles] Not again.
-Pretty hardcore, too.

02:38.960 --> 02:39.960
Better let me see.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.560
No, no, no, no, no.
It will warp the baby.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.640
-Baby's been kicking me all night.
-Really?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.320
-Yup.
-Not now.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.360
You doing okay?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.360
-Yeah.
-Any progress?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.680
-On the break-in.
-No.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.480
Still working on it.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.520
I might print out some flyers for Smudge

03:05.600 --> 03:07.200
-and go stick them up today.
-[sighs]

03:07.280 --> 03:08.600
Just relax.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.600
-Honestly...
-I'm not an invalid.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.280
-I know you're not.
-[knocking at door]

03:14.600 --> 03:16.040
Can you get that?
I need to do a wee.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.240
Yeah.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.800
Vic? What happened?

03:23.880 --> 03:26.440
Ah, just had a bit of an accident.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.360
Looks worse than it is.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.080
-Do you want to come in?
-No.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.680
Actually, I've been thinking...

03:34.760 --> 03:37.480
those people you told me about?

03:37.560 --> 03:41.120
Yeah, so you believe me now?

03:41.200 --> 03:43.600
Well, you can't blame me
for having doubts, but...

03:43.680 --> 03:45.320
yeah, I do believe you now.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.240
-Have you found them?
-No.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.120
Dr McKellar has taken them somewhere.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.400
What, all of them? Where?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.000
I don't know.
She won't answer her phone.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.560
I need to find them.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.640
Yeah, I'm trying to find them, Vic.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.880
You need to leave this with me now.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.840
[Sarah] Hi, Vic.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.680
You all right?

04:06.720 --> 04:08.360
Ah, it's just a scratch.
[chuckles]

04:08.920 --> 04:11.840
-[sighs] Do you want to come inside?
-No, I gotta get going.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.320
What was that about?

04:18.920 --> 04:21.280
Ah, it's, uh, break-in at the shops.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.480
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.480
Do you think it's the same people
who broke in here?

04:24.560 --> 04:25.920
Not sure yet.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.840
[sighs] Maybe I should go and ask around.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.400
No, you need to rest, okay?
Just rest.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.680
Please.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.800
You know, this is the last few days

04:35.880 --> 04:37.360
of decent sleep
we're gonna get for a long time.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.240
-I gotta get ready.
-Okay.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.600
Kirstie's dressing needs changing.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.280
If you tell me where
the antiseptic is, I can do it.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.080
Where's Maria?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.760
I don't know.
We woke up, there's no sign of her.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.600
Do you think she's like Carlo?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.960
-I told you all it's dangerous.
-[Kirstie] Oh, relax.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.600
She probably just saw the Virgin Mary
on a fence post somewhere.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.400
Don't you all get sick
of being so serious?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.600
I got food.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.040
What, poor man's mutton?

05:35.760 --> 05:38.640
Ugh. What a freak show!

06:21.320 --> 06:22.560
[piano playing]

-[plays off-tune]
-Oh.

[speaking Italian]

06:36.560 --> 06:37.800
[in English] Again.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.080
[continues speaking Italian]

06:47.920 --> 06:50.720
[both speaking Italian]

06:50.800 --> 06:53.600
-[Leon in English] It was worth the money.
-[chuckles]

06:58.920 --> 07:00.680
[girl] Do you want some chocolate?

07:05.240 --> 07:08.160
Young ladies shouldn't eat chocolate.
You'll get fat.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.440
Mum!

07:12.240 --> 07:13.440
What are you doing in here?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.320
Did Leon Massola sell you this house?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.640
Get out of here!
Get out!

07:17.720 --> 07:19.160
-Where's my husband?
-Go on, leave!

07:19.240 --> 07:21.320
You have no pride in your home.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.480
-No pride in your children.
-Leave, now!

07:23.560 --> 07:25.440
How dare you talk
to my daughter like that?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.400
-I'm calling the police!
-[panting]

07:27.480 --> 07:29.240
You psycho!

07:40.280 --> 07:41.560
It's an aeroplane.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.840
Have you ever seen one before?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.000
I don't remember.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.000
Your memories will return.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.600
And for all the others.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.160
I remember doing that.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.760
Does it hurt?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.320
I'm not afraid of you.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.160
Church is closed today, love.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
This is God's house.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.040
Father Reid will be here next week.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.360
I can't wait another week.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.440
Are you a local?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.400
I am God's miracle upon this earth.

09:03.560 --> 09:07.280
I am, as Lazarus,
returned from the dead.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.560
I am the resurrected. [sobs]

09:12.640 --> 09:14.840
[softly] Why don't I make us
a nice cup of tea?

09:14.920 --> 09:16.560
[breath trembling]

09:25.160 --> 09:27.280
[Chris on phone]
Vic's crashed his car at the bridge.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.480
Yeah, yeah. Vic's okay.
I just saw him.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.640
I'll let his wife know.
She's been calling.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.840
Thanks for letting me know.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.280
Oh, and, um... there's a call.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.680
Some distressed woman
at the Catholic church.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.120
-Can you check it out?
-Yup. Yes, I'll be right there.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.280
What the hell's going on
in Yoorana, right?

09:44.360 --> 09:45.560
[line disconnects]

09:49.560 --> 09:51.080
[engine starts]

09:57.160 --> 09:59.680
[Paddy] It's here. Corona Hill.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.840
So, what now?

10:21.360 --> 10:22.880
I'm going home.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.080
[Beau] Well, you just can't walk in.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.480
Sure, it's my house.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.360
And you, my friend,
are accepting my gracious invitation.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.440
Come on.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.920
[door closes]

10:50.000 --> 10:52.160
[sighs] It's bloody old.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.640
It's a bit of a shambles, all right.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.240
But it's my legacy.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.880
[sighs]

11:05.280 --> 11:06.640
Oh, Jesus.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.440
Look at this.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.000
They've turned the place
into a doss house.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
[Beau] A what?

11:32.760 --> 11:33.960
[whispers] Where are you going?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.120
[Paddy] Yeah.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.520
It's in one of these rooms.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.720
What?

12:03.160 --> 12:04.560
-[door opens]
-[men speaking indistinctly]

12:04.640 --> 12:05.760
Shh.

-[door closes]
-[hip-hop music playing]

12:08.560 --> 12:10.920
-Rory, I'll get you a black.
-[Rory] No, I'm good.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.440
[man] Come on.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.240
Have you seen the lighter?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.840
[indistinct chatter]

12:21.520 --> 12:23.200
Let's get out of here.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.920
I've got something hidden here.
Something important.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.320
-Yeah, we can come back and get it--
-Then you go.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.040
[chatter continues]

12:45.960 --> 12:47.360
What the fuck?

12:47.440 --> 12:48.760
[Rory] Oi, who's this fella?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.280
Uh... Beau.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.680
What are you doing here, Beau?

12:56.720 --> 12:58.600
-I thought it was empty.
-[Angus] It's not empty, mate.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.800
It's his house.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.040
Yeah.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.480
We're the traditional owners.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.480
I'm Rory Fitzgerald.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.360
-This is my cousin, Angus.
-[clicks tongue]

13:12.280 --> 13:13.800
Come and have a beer with us.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.280
[chatter and music continue]

13:30.000 --> 13:31.800
[guns firing on video game]

13:44.280 --> 13:45.600
Oh, you're dead, mate.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.880
Hey, Beau... do you want a cone?

13:48.960 --> 13:50.520
It's good weed, that stuff.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.440
-Come on.
-Oh, you're not going until you smoke.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.680
[man] Come on, mate, just take it.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.440
Can we change this game? Can we...
I'll play something else.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.440
[Angus] What's your problem?

14:04.520 --> 14:06.200
[Rory] Come on, mate.
What are you doing?

14:15.480 --> 14:18.880
Hold it in your lungs, you fucking pussy.
Come on.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.840
[coughing]

14:21.920 --> 14:23.360
[all laughing]

14:23.440 --> 14:25.920
[Angus] What a waste.
[man] I'll have the next, mate.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.080
[sighs]

14:37.040 --> 14:38.280
[grunts]

14:56.360 --> 14:57.520
Maria.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.000
Leave me alone.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.560
Maria, where is Elishia keeping you all?

15:04.640 --> 15:08.000
You and her, you want...
you want to hide the Lord's miracle.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.000
No, I'm trying to help you.
She's the one that's hiding you.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.200
If you accept the truth...

15:14.400 --> 15:16.320
you have to accept God.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.360
That's what terrifies you.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.800
Maria, listen to me.
I need to find my wife.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.080
I need to see Kate.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.000
[sobs] My husband's gone too.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.840
Leon Massola?

15:33.040 --> 15:36.000
-Some awful people live in our house.
-He's not gone.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.880
-He's still here.
-You know where he is?

15:37.960 --> 15:41.720
I was doing some research
to try and find something to link you all.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.200
-And I've found your husband.
-Oh, where?

15:44.280 --> 15:47.200
I can take you to him
if you take me to Kate.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.200
-Deal?
-Deal.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Come on.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.640
[dogs barking in the distance]

17:19.640 --> 17:21.320
Well, it's healing well.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.440
Looks normal.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.800
[scoffs softly]
Yeah, I'm so fucking normal.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.040
[chuckles]

17:27.120 --> 17:28.440
As normal as the rest of us.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.120
There's an unsealed road.
We could try there.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.480
It leads straight to the highway.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.640
Why?

17:34.640 --> 17:37.760
If Kirstie's leg gets worse,
I don't have the facilities.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.160
[Kirstie] I'm fine.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.920
Don't you wanna find a way out of here?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.640
Not if it means corking it.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.400
I've tried that road. I got really sick.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.440
We need to know for certain
if you're all trapped here,

17:46.520 --> 17:48.920
and if you are, within what radius?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.520
[sighs] Do you think it's...
some kind of radiation?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.640
It's all speculation
until there's real data.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.280
So, how do you get data?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.880
Only one way.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.640
Through testing.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
I'll do it.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.280
Are you crazy?

18:05.360 --> 18:07.080
There's only one way.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.080
[scoffs] Not a chance.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.640
Come on then, let's go.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
[door closes]

18:22.320 --> 18:23.440
Fuck.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.520
[man] Hey, is this yours?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.280
-Yeah.
-Pretty shit.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.200
-Yeah, pass it here.
-[man] Pretty shit phone.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.680
Over here.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.920
-Ooh.
-[Angus] Oh, what's on there?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.120
-There's something on there, Beau?
-[whistles]

18:47.200 --> 18:50.240
Like, some nudie pictures
or something freaky?

18:50.320 --> 18:52.600
-Come on, give me my phone.
-[Angus] Come get it back.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.960
[grunts]

18:57.640 --> 18:58.920
Just give me my phone.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.360
Gotta jump for it, mate.

19:01.520 --> 19:05.040
[man] Go jump! Go on. [laughs]
[Angus] You gotta want it, mate.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.760
-[Rory] Good boy. Good boy.
-[man laughing]

19:08.840 --> 19:11.640
-Oh, there you go. One more, yeah.
-[man] Oh, close, mate.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.880
-Work for it.
-[Rory] Go on, like a kangaroo.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.400
Yeah.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.760
Kangaroo.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.760
-[man laughing]
-[Rory] That's it.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.240
-No, no. Like a kangaroo.
-One more.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.920
Do the little paws.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.520
[man] Keep going.
[Rory] Come on.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.960
-[all laughing]
-[Rory] Oh.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.480
-Oh.
-Nearly there.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.920
-Oh, come on.
-[Rory] Jump. Go.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.600
[Lucy] Rory!

19:30.680 --> 19:32.560
Oh, shit. It's Mum.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.960
-[door closes]
-[Rory] Hide it.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.600
[Angus] Yeah, pack it up, pack it up.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.640
-Beau, move.
-[speaking indistinctly]

19:43.520 --> 19:44.560
[Rory] Hey.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.840
[bottle cap clatters]

19:47.920 --> 19:50.680
Would someone like to tell me
what's going on?

19:50.760 --> 19:53.280
[Rory] Yeah, this kid just broke in.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.040
[sighs]

20:05.120 --> 20:06.720
Here?

20:06.800 --> 20:10.280
It's been 50 years, Maria.
He won't be the same as you remember him.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.560
-He's still my husband.
-Yes, he is.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.120
Let me talk to him first, okay?
Maria!

20:21.760 --> 20:24.680
-Excuse me, I'm looking for Leon Massola.
-Room 237.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.720
-Down the hall to the right.
-Thank you.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.440
[phone ringing]

20:46.960 --> 20:48.680
[knocking on door]

20:50.200 --> 20:51.680
[James] Hello.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.160
Mr Massola, I'm Sergeant James Hayes.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.160
I wanted to ask you some questions
about your wife, Maria.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.600
[feebly] Maria.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.360
[James] You remember her?

21:14.520 --> 21:17.080
My love.
[inhales sharply]

21:17.160 --> 21:18.240
[sighs]

21:20.480 --> 21:21.640
Maria?

21:23.720 --> 21:24.760
Sì.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.600
[speaking Italian]

21:29.400 --> 21:30.640
[gasps]

21:36.120 --> 21:37.240
[grunting]

21:38.360 --> 21:39.520
Puttana!

21:40.440 --> 21:42.600
[speaking Italian]

21:42.680 --> 21:43.840
[in English] Whore!

21:43.920 --> 21:46.800
-[Leon grunting]
-Come on, come on, come on.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.760
[Leon]  Puttana!
You are a whore!

21:50.840 --> 21:52.400
I am not a whore.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.720
-I'm not a whore.
-He's got dementia.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.840
He barely knows where he is.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.400
I am not a whore!

21:57.480 --> 21:59.200
[panting]

22:20.920 --> 22:21.960
You okay?

22:23.560 --> 22:25.520
-Maria?
-[gasps]

22:28.320 --> 22:29.320
What is it?

22:36.320 --> 22:37.360
[Maria] Who's this?

22:38.240 --> 22:40.920
That's Don Sharp.
He still lives in town.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.120
I need to see this boy.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.080
We had a deal. We're finding Kate now.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.080
This boy will know.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.400
Don't you understand?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.480
This isn't a miracle.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.280
It's a punishment.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.240
[woman on PA]  Hello. Noregard.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.840
Senior Sergeant Vic Eastley,
Echuca Police.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.880
Does Dr Elishia McKellar work there?

23:31.960 --> 23:34.520
[woman]  I'm not authorised to give out
information on employees.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.600
Is there somebody inside I can speak to?

23:40.040 --> 23:41.040
Hello?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.640
[mobile phone ringing]

24:05.960 --> 24:07.640
Vic, it's Caroline.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.600
Listen, I'm in Yoorana.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.280
Are you still here?
'Cause I've come to take you home.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.080
All right.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.680
I'm presuming the car's a write-off.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.120
Yeah.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.200
You know, I can't believe
you had an accident

24:23.280 --> 24:24.960
and you didn't even tell your wife!

24:25.040 --> 24:26.960
[sighs]  I'll meet you at the motel.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.320
Okay.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.760
We have to find an exit.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.880
I can't hide you in Yoorana forever.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.960
Who exactly are you hiding us from?

24:53.040 --> 24:54.840
Every single person
who'll want to cut you open

24:54.920 --> 24:56.960
to see what's making
your dead heart beat,

24:57.040 --> 24:59.440
sending the electrical impulses
to your dead brain.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.080
Do you want that?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.040
No.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.480
I'll do it.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.960
Are you sure?

25:16.720 --> 25:18.480
Everything's normal.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.560
[breathing deeply]

25:27.760 --> 25:29.520
[Charlie exhales]

25:47.120 --> 25:48.400
Nothing.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.880
All right. Just keep walking.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.280
Maybe this part's all right.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Okay, Charlie?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.760
-Okay, keep it up.
-[sighs]

26:29.160 --> 26:30.400
[groans]

26:34.320 --> 26:36.120
No, stop!
The same thing happened to me!

26:36.200 --> 26:37.240
[Charlie groaning]

26:39.400 --> 26:41.800
Just move back.
Move back.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.880
[grunting]

26:51.120 --> 26:52.360
[groans]

26:56.160 --> 26:57.960
[breathing deeply]

27:01.120 --> 27:03.160
He's fine.
He's all right.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.680
We'll find somewhere else.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.200
[James] That's him.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.480
-He's old, too.
-Yeah, that's what happens.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.880
Not to me.
[chuckles softly]

27:32.320 --> 27:33.960
-James, how are you?
-Great, Don.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.040
-Well, how are you?
-Yeah, not bad.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.200
-Good to see you, mate.
-You too.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.080
Ah. You, uh...
you looking for a trade-in?

27:42.160 --> 27:44.800
You know,
something to suit the new family?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.560
[James] Not at the moment. Thank you.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.960
Ah, right.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.520
Donald Sharp?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.040
-Sorry, do I know you?
-This is Sophia.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.040
Uh, she's a relative of the Massolas.
Do you remember them?

27:56.120 --> 27:59.440
[chuckles]
You look almost exactly like, um...

27:59.520 --> 28:02.440
-Maria was my--
-Mother's cousin.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.760
Uh, Sophia is just in town visiting Leon.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.280
Oh, how is he?

28:06.360 --> 28:08.400
I actually just wanted to know
a bit more about Maria.

28:08.480 --> 28:12.680
Oh, Maria, gosh.
I really didn't know her that well.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.560
Oh, you were one of her students,
weren't you? [chuckles]

28:17.840 --> 28:18.880
Yes, I guess so.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.600
-What's this about?
-So, you did know her?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.400
Well, you know,

28:23.480 --> 28:26.360
only in the way
that everyone knew Maria Massola.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.520
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Well... [scoffs softly]

28:29.600 --> 28:33.560
She was beautiful, you know?
Kind of exotic.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.200
All the boys thought so.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.840
Oh, I really didn't know her that well.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.560
-You're lying.
-What?

28:41.640 --> 28:44.280
You were in a car with her.
Where were you going?

28:44.360 --> 28:47.440
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't understand...
[stutters]

28:47.520 --> 28:48.760
Don, this is important, actually.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.480
[Don] Well, uh...

28:54.080 --> 28:56.400
I gave her a few driving lessons.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.760
My parents couldn't afford to pay
for the piano classes,

28:59.840 --> 29:02.160
so I offered to teach her in exchange.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.320
-What happened?
-[Don] Nothing.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.560
What happened?

29:06.320 --> 29:09.880
Well, you know, I might have just
tried it on her once. [chuckles]

29:10.840 --> 29:13.600
And she just gave me a slap
right across the face.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.880
[sighs]

29:15.800 --> 29:16.920
Good.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.160
Listen, do you know by any chance
how she died?

29:21.240 --> 29:23.640
There was a car accident.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.440
It's very sad.
The whole town was in shock.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.920
-That's it?
-[Don] Yeah.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.440
Yeah. That's it.
Uh, excuse me, James.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.360
Thanks, Don.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.800
[ragged breathing]

29:43.360 --> 29:45.600
Leon never wanted me to drive.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.800
He was so old-fashioned. [whimpers]

29:53.920 --> 29:57.480
But I was faithful to him.
He needs to know that.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.920
No, now you take me to Kate.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.600
All these years,
he thought I betrayed him.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.440
I'm not gonna make him wait another day.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.760
-[Maria sobbing]
-[car door opens]

30:09.840 --> 30:11.080
[dialing]

30:12.600 --> 30:13.920
[mobile phone rings]

30:22.200 --> 30:23.880
-What do you want?
-[James]  Kate, where are you?

30:23.960 --> 30:27.480
Trying to find a way
out of this fucking town.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.520
-Listen to me--
-Yeah, I think I've heard enough, James.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.000
You cannot--
Listen to me, Kate!

30:33.760 --> 30:35.400
Okay, no more detours.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.400
You are taking me to Elishia's now.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.000
[Caroline] God, you look like shit.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.440
Have you even seen the doctor?

31:01.480 --> 31:02.720
I tried.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.320
Yeah, of course you tried.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.360
Come on, let's get your things.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.280
Oh, this is glamorous.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.920
You didn't call me.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.240
What, so, is this your way of leaving me?

31:33.040 --> 31:35.360
'Cause you should've done it
ten years ago, if that's the case.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.240
[keys clatter]

31:48.760 --> 31:51.000
I know you think I don't care.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.560
[voice breaking] I was worried.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.480
-Oh, God, what have you--
-[winces]

32:05.320 --> 32:06.520
[Caroline sighs]

32:29.200 --> 32:31.000
I thought you were--

32:46.920 --> 32:48.120
[breathes heavily]

32:56.840 --> 32:58.640
What's got into you?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.400
[moaning]

33:20.280 --> 33:21.960
[Caroline] Oh, God.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.200
[Lucy] Wait here.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.280
-Thank you for coming so quickly.
-[Chris] Of course, Lucy.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.800
[Lucy sighs] Now,
this young man was apprehended

33:40.880 --> 33:44.000
-trespassing in my house.
-[door closes]

33:44.080 --> 33:46.520
-G'day, Beau.
-[sighs]

33:46.600 --> 33:49.360
-He do any damage?
-Not that I'm aware of.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.080
Fortunately, my son and his friends
were here at the time,

33:53.160 --> 33:56.680
hoping to get the place ready
for the handover.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.000
[Chris] All right, I'll take him in.
[Lucy] Uh, look...

33:59.080 --> 34:02.040
If you could just let his parents
know what he's been up to?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.200
I'm sure that will suffice.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.800
Don't tell my mum.
We didn't take anything.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.920
We?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.840
Who else you here with?

34:11.760 --> 34:12.760
No one.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.040
[Chris] All right, come on.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.840
-[Chris] Thanks a lot, Lucy.
-Thanks, Chris.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.720
[car engine starts]

34:42.240 --> 34:45.160
[Elishia] This is it, Charlie.
The last exit.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.160
[birds screech]

34:58.640 --> 34:59.800
Yeah, there it is.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.360
[Charlie groans]

35:07.640 --> 35:08.840
Come on.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.440
[groans]

35:17.760 --> 35:19.680
-Push through it. Push through it.
-[groans]

35:21.120 --> 35:24.280
-That's good. That's good.
-[Kate] Don't push him!

35:24.360 --> 35:25.880
Don't push him!

35:27.840 --> 35:29.840
[honking]

35:31.800 --> 35:33.560
[grunting]

35:33.640 --> 35:35.240
He's all right. He's still breathing.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.320
You psycho bitch.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.800
-You were gonna kill him!
-[Charlie grunts]

35:39.320 --> 35:41.040
That's it, Charlie. Come.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.560
Charlie!

35:42.640 --> 35:43.800
-Get me my bag.
-[Kate] Charlie!

35:43.880 --> 35:45.040
-Get me my bag.
-Bag.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.920
[Charlie groans]

36:19.480 --> 36:21.040
Help us.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.400
Just get him inside.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.440
[James] What did you do?
[Elishia] Nothing.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.760
He's gonna be all right.
He just needs to rest now.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.640
[Kirstie] As if you give a shit.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.080
I'm trying to find an exit for all of you.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.360
You took them to the bridge?

36:35.440 --> 36:36.880
Yeah, and every other way
out of this town.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.040
-[coughs]
-He got sick every time.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.640
-He didn't just get sick. You pushed him.
-He needs water.

36:41.720 --> 36:45.920
-Nearly there, Charlie. Come on.
-[James] Come on. Around there.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.200
-Okay.
-[Elishia] Here you go.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.920
-[grunts]
-Here you go.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.480
Kate.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.040
[coughing]

37:04.520 --> 37:07.480
-So there's no way out of Yoorana?
-None that I can find.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.880
And who asked you to fucking find one?

37:24.520 --> 37:25.600
Kate.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.480
You moved on. I get it.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.760
But I have to move on too.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.800
And it's okay.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.840
[voice breaking] I'm alive.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.480
And...

37:50.600 --> 37:54.760
there's sun and there's sky
and there's grass.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.280
I'm not sick.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.240
[chuckles] And I feel incredible.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.920
So I'm not gonna sit
around here feeling... [sobs]

38:06.240 --> 38:07.880
feeling sorry for myself.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.560
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-Maybe...

38:10.640 --> 38:13.400
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be forever.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.800
What?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.440
-It doesn't matter any more.
-It does.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.280
-[sniffles] No--
-Kate, it does.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.720
It matters.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.120
And you have no idea.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.480
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.080
Come with me.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.760
Thank you.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.440
Goodbye.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.320
[door opens]

39:04.000 --> 39:05.160
[door closes]

39:15.080 --> 39:18.280
-[car door closes]
-[engine starts]

39:30.760 --> 39:34.160
I bought this place after you died.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.160
It's beautiful.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.920
[chuckles]

40:07.560 --> 40:09.480
Oh, my favourite shirt.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.880
Oh...

40:16.280 --> 40:17.600
You kept all this stuff?

40:17.680 --> 40:19.200
[chuckles] Yeah.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.480
[chuckles] Third anniversary winery tour?

40:27.560 --> 40:28.920
[chuckles softly]

40:30.080 --> 40:31.280
[chuckles softly]

40:36.920 --> 40:38.960
[Kate sighs and groans]

40:41.720 --> 40:43.080
Oh, my helmet.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.680
-[sighs]
-I can't believe you kept all this.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.160
[chuckles]

41:21.600 --> 41:24.880
When I put you in that coffin,
it was so small.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.440
And I just remember thinking to myself...

41:29.640 --> 41:32.760
"That can't possibly contain her."

41:32.840 --> 41:35.520
Everything that you were.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.440
So...

41:40.000 --> 41:42.320
this place sort of became you.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.080
You know, not some box in the ground.
You know, I could just...

41:49.400 --> 41:50.720
come here...

41:52.600 --> 41:53.960
and be with you.

42:53.520 --> 42:55.280
[vehicle approaches]

43:17.280 --> 43:18.520
Hey, Vic.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.920
How's the head?

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
-Have you seen a doctor yet?
-Oh...

43:23.080 --> 43:26.800
-I've been looking for Dr McKellar.
-You've been running after hours?

43:27.720 --> 43:31.600
[sighs] Well, she's not at the surgery.
Anywhere else she might be?

43:31.680 --> 43:33.240
I don't know. Sorry.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.440
James is at work still.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.440
Some dickhead's been
in a robbery spree, it seems.

43:40.520 --> 43:42.440
Think that's related
to the business at the cemetery?

43:42.520 --> 43:44.000
What business?

43:44.080 --> 43:46.480
-What, James hasn't mentioned it?
-No.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.840
[sighs] Some grave was
mucked around with the other night.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.560
Oh. That's awful.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.440
Well... James will be handling it,
I'm sure.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.920
I was just there last week.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.080
-Oh, you were?
-Yeah, well, Kate's buried there.

44:02.160 --> 44:04.160
I put flowers on her grave sometimes.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.600
Why do you do that?

44:07.880 --> 44:09.360
Uh...

44:09.440 --> 44:12.360
I guess, when I go there,
I feel close to her.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.960
Of course.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.720
That's what cemeteries are for,
aren't they?

44:20.560 --> 44:24.080
[sighs] Is there a message
that you want me to pass on to James?

44:24.160 --> 44:26.400
No. No, it's fine.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.280
[chuckles softly]

44:33.800 --> 44:35.720
Is that...

44:35.800 --> 44:38.840
-Is that heavy?
-Uh, a little. [chuckles]

44:39.760 --> 44:41.440
[sighs] Well...

44:43.320 --> 44:46.040
[chuckles] I'd lie down, if I were you.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.400
[chuckles nervously]

44:49.200 --> 44:51.400
-Well, see ya.
-See ya.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.520
[engine starts]

45:25.400 --> 45:26.920
I used the rabbits.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.320
Thank you.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.200
[spoon scraping]

45:35.440 --> 45:36.480
What is this?

45:37.400 --> 45:38.480
Osso buco.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.440
-[Charlie] It's great.
-[Maria chuckles]

45:40.520 --> 45:42.280
I'm an excellent cook.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.160
You're feeling better.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.400
I'm right as rain.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.320
No thanks to you.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.160
Well, thank you, Charlie.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.440
Now we know.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.360
[Kirstie] Yeah.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.080
I was stuck in Yoorana
last time I was alive.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.680
Nothing's changed.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.200
All of us need to put things right.

46:05.200 --> 46:06.280
What things?

46:07.920 --> 46:09.600
Our past.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.320
Our mistakes.

46:12.400 --> 46:15.080
Let those we left behind know the truth.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.920
I don't have anyone left.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.120
-I didn't make any mistakes.
-[Elishia] Then why did you die so young?

46:22.040 --> 46:24.240
Let's just stick to the facts,
what we know for certain.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.280
None of this makes any sense.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.440
What about you?

46:35.240 --> 46:36.520
What do you think this is?

46:38.760 --> 46:40.640
Nothing to say, Einstein?

46:40.720 --> 46:42.880
-What a surprise.
-Kirstie.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.760
No, seriously.
What's he doing here?

46:48.800 --> 46:50.560
'Cause we don't know anything about him,

46:50.640 --> 46:53.320
-and he could've been a killer--
-[Elishia] That's enough, Kirstie.

46:53.400 --> 46:54.760
-No, seriously, say something!
-That's enough.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.120
[Kirstie] You never say a bloody word.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.640
-[Elishia] Kirstie.
-[grunts]

46:58.560 --> 47:00.080
[clattering]

47:00.160 --> 47:01.840
-[grunts]
-[Kirstie] You arsehole!

47:01.920 --> 47:03.760
[both grunting]

47:03.840 --> 47:05.040
Get off him! Get off him!

47:05.120 --> 47:06.360
-[growls]
-[gasps]

47:08.640 --> 47:10.080
This is how you behave?

47:10.160 --> 47:11.320
Is it?

47:13.560 --> 47:14.840
[panting]

47:17.400 --> 47:18.880
[Charlie] You all right?

47:42.600 --> 47:43.880
[James sighs]

47:49.480 --> 47:50.840
[softly] I love you.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.560
[softly] I love you, too.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.440
[woman speaking indistinctly on TV]

48:42.400 --> 48:43.680
Leon.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.480
You used to say
this was a food of heaven.

49:05.960 --> 49:07.760
I'm not what you thought.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.840
I was faithful to you.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.840
Always.

49:15.200 --> 49:16.640
You can't trust them.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.240
These Nazis, they...
they steal my watch.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.600
I'll play to you.

49:34.280 --> 49:35.680
You always loved that.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.400
[plays classical music]

50:20.280 --> 50:22.200
What were you doing
with that boy in the car?

50:22.280 --> 50:24.760
Puttana!  Whore!

50:24.840 --> 50:27.000

-[slams piano keys]

50:27.080 --> 50:28.160

50:30.400 --> 50:31.600
[Leon]  You're a whore!

50:31.680 --> 50:34.480
-Puttana!
-[sobbing]

50:34.560 --> 50:36.400

Maria!

50:38.280 --> 50:40.480
-Maria!
-[engine starts]

50:40.560 --> 50:42.000
Open the door.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.320
Maria?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.200
-[Anna] Mama?
-Anna?

-[Maria gasps]

[Anna screams]

51:14.280 --> 51:15.880
[breathing slowly]

51:59.160 --> 52:00.800
What are you doing?

52:01.960 --> 52:05.280
-I don't belong here.
-Well, you can't leave Yoorana.

52:09.080 --> 52:11.320
You will eventually remember who you are.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.400
I know what I am.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.000
Anna, my darling.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.760
Forgive me.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.960
I've been looking for you.

I'm here to help.
