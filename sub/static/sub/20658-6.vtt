04:59.967 --> 05:00.933

05:00.933 --> 05:01.900
over-showering can dry out

05:01.900 --> 05:03.233
your skin because it removes

05:03.233 --> 05:04.967
protective lipids and oils.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.900
Rinsing off is fine, but you

05:06.900 --> 05:08.133
should only use a minimal amount

05:08.133 --> 05:09.200
of soap in your underarms and

05:09.200 --> 05:10.233
groin.

phone, you can call for help!

06:38.900 --> 06:39.800
We're saved!

06:39.800 --> 06:40.633
No, this is just my

06:40.633 --> 06:42.233
Tamagotchi-- I've kept him alive

06:42.233 --> 06:44.133
for 17 years.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.633
Have some food, little buddy.

06:45.633 --> 06:46.467
Mu-ah.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.900
Anyway, I was just about to tell

06:47.900 --> 06:49.867
you about the massive flimflam

06:49.867 --> 06:51.733
that is the flushable wipe.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.100
Ugh.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.400
Fine.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
(mixers whirring and rattling)

06:56.400 --> 06:58.233
(over noise) What are those for?

06:58.233 --> 07:00.067
I'll explain later.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.400
Toilet paper as we know it was

07:01.400 --> 07:03.367
invented in 1883, and for the

07:03.367 --> 07:05.100
next 118 years, our bottom

07:05.100 --> 07:06.567
hygiene routine was pretty

07:06.567 --> 07:08.567
simple: toilet, T.P.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.800
and wash your hands.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.900
And it worked.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.867
Those were some of our best

07:11.900 --> 07:13.800
hygiene years ever.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.533
Rates of poop-related

07:15.567 --> 07:17.233
diseases have plummeted.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.867
Good job, America.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.600
Your butts are clean.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.933
There must be some other reason

07:22.933 --> 07:25.033
we're dying.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.200
But in 2001, America's paper

07:27.200 --> 07:28.767
companies decided that wasn't

07:28.767 --> 07:30.267
good enough.

07:30.267 --> 07:31.067
Soap sales are up,

07:31.067 --> 07:32.400
but butt paper's flat.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.633
How do we get people to buy more

07:33.633 --> 07:34.767
butt paper?

07:34.767 --> 07:35.567
Let's convince adults

07:35.567 --> 07:36.700
they need to wipe their rears

07:36.700 --> 07:38.033
with baby wipes.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.133
And let's tell them

07:39.133 --> 07:40.267
to wear diapers.

07:40.267 --> 07:41.467
No, Dan, that's your

07:41.467 --> 07:42.300
weird thing.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.233
Aww, baby sad.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.233
The Kimberly-Clark

07:45.233 --> 07:48.233
Corporation spent $140 million

07:48.233 --> 07:50.133
to develop and market the first

07:50.133 --> 07:51.900
"flushable wipes" and by now,

07:51.900 --> 07:52.900
you can guess what their

07:52.900 --> 07:53.700
pitch was.

07:53.700 --> 07:54.933
They told you you're stinky and

07:54.933 --> 07:56.200
you just don't know it.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.433
Check out these real

07:57.433 --> 07:59.067
flushable wipe commercials.

just dry paper?

08:10.033 --> 08:11.633
No. No...

08:11.633 --> 08:13.067
No...

08:13.067 --> 08:15.733
Why do you need a butt wipe?

08:15.733 --> 08:17.200
Because you're not an animal,

08:17.200 --> 08:18.433
and whatever you're using now

08:18.433 --> 08:19.733
is primitive.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.400
Can we watch a real movie?

08:21.400 --> 08:22.533
You know, I don't really care

08:22.533 --> 08:23.567
for movies.

08:23.567 --> 08:24.700
Anyway, once again,

08:24.700 --> 08:26.400
this shame scam worked.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.300
Flushable wipes are now an

08:27.300 --> 08:28.533
industry that's worth more than

08:28.533 --> 08:30.367
$300 million.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.067
Yeah, I do feel like I need

08:32.067 --> 08:33.367
them now and I didn't, like,

08:33.367 --> 08:34.567
two years ago.

08:34.567 --> 08:35.900
It's no wonder they're trying

08:35.900 --> 08:37.300
to shove wipes up our butts.

08:37.300 --> 08:38.900
Flushable wipes cost more than

08:38.900 --> 08:40.133
six times as much as toilet

08:40.133 --> 08:41.367
paper, and these companies would

08:41.367 --> 08:42.633
have you use both.

08:42.633 --> 08:43.567
Have a bit of the dry paper,

08:43.567 --> 08:45.200
and then use the wet, and then

08:45.200 --> 08:46.467
use the dry again, boom,

08:46.467 --> 08:47.567
good to go.

08:47.567 --> 08:48.733
Okay.

08:48.733 --> 08:49.800
Well, flushable wipes are

08:49.800 --> 08:50.933
expensive, but at least they

08:50.933 --> 08:51.933
make me feel cleaner.

08:51.933 --> 08:52.767
It's not like they're doing

08:52.767 --> 08:53.733
any harm.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.200
Uh, actually, they're harming

08:55.200 --> 08:56.967
everybody because flushable

08:56.967 --> 08:58.300
wipes are straight up

08:58.300 --> 08:59.733
not flushable.

08:59.733 --> 09:00.900
But it says "flushable"

09:00.900 --> 09:02.433
right on the box. See?

09:02.433 --> 09:03.467

09:09.933 --> 09:10.967
Come on, for science.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.400
Oh...

09:12.400 --> 09:14.233
See? Toilet paper breaks down

09:14.233 --> 09:16.233
almost instantly in water,

09:16.233 --> 09:17.633
but I put this flushable wipe

09:17.633 --> 09:19.567
in that mixer five minutes ago,

09:19.567 --> 09:22.067
it hasn't broken down at all.

09:22.067 --> 09:22.933
Ugh...

09:22.933 --> 09:23.933
Well, it still goes down

09:23.933 --> 09:24.733
the toilet.

09:24.733 --> 09:25.700
Yeah, a lot of things

09:25.700 --> 09:26.767
technically can go down

09:26.767 --> 09:27.567
the toilet.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.033
That doesn't mean they should.

09:29.033 --> 09:31.900
Watch this.

09:31.900 --> 09:32.800
Aah! Don't do that!

09:32.800 --> 09:34.567
You'll wreck my plumbing!

09:34.567 --> 09:35.567
Don't worry.

09:35.567 --> 09:36.700
These are flushable golf balls,

09:36.700 --> 09:37.533
see?

09:37.533 --> 09:38.900
Cut it out!

09:38.900 --> 09:39.800
Ugh!

09:39.800 --> 09:41.067
I need to get out of here.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.267
Maybe I could break the door

09:42.267 --> 09:43.533
down with my head.

09:43.533 --> 09:44.700
Oh, I know how we can

09:44.700 --> 09:45.567
get out of here.

09:45.567 --> 09:46.600
We can go down the pipes.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.567
Really?

09:47.567 --> 09:48.567
Let's do it!

09:48.567 --> 09:49.700
Great. Take my hand and we'll

09:49.700 --> 09:51.200
go on a magical journey

09:51.200 --> 09:53.533
down your toilet.

09:53.533 --> 09:54.233
Wait!

09:54.233 --> 09:55.467
Can't we take the sink instead?

09:55.467 --> 09:56.367
Nope.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.400
Here we go!

09:57.400 --> 10:00.567
(both screaming)

10:00.567 --> 10:03.967
(toilet gurgles)

10:03.967 --> 10:06.733

10:16.033 --> 10:17.133
What happened?

10:17.133 --> 10:19.033
Oh-- we hit a fatberg.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.633
A what?

10:20.633 --> 10:21.900
It's a congealed mass of

10:21.900 --> 10:23.233
flushable wipes combined with

10:23.233 --> 10:24.700
cooking oil and other junk.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.433
We in the sewer business

10:25.433 --> 10:26.567
call them fatbergs.

10:26.567 --> 10:27.533
Oh, it is so cool

10:27.567 --> 10:28.567
you're here.

10:28.567 --> 10:29.567
This is Tyrone Jue.

10:29.567 --> 10:30.733
He's with the San Francisco

10:30.733 --> 10:32.133
Public Utility Commission.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.467
Tyrone, would you tell Haley

10:33.467 --> 10:34.900
what sewer engineers hate about

10:34.900 --> 10:36.067
flushable wipes?

10:36.067 --> 10:37.233
Well, everything you flush

10:37.233 --> 10:38.567
down the toilet, we have to

10:38.567 --> 10:39.300
deal with.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.600
In San Francisco, we've had to

10:40.600 --> 10:42.633
spend about $4 million a year

10:42.633 --> 10:43.467
having to clear out

10:43.467 --> 10:44.467
these fatbergs.

10:44.467 --> 10:45.400
Every city across the world

10:45.400 --> 10:46.367
is dealing with exactly

10:46.367 --> 10:47.233
the same problem.

10:47.233 --> 10:48.900
Yeah, in 2013, London had to

10:48.900 --> 10:51.600
pull a 15-ton fatberg out of

10:51.600 --> 10:52.867
their sewers.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.767
It was the size of a city bus.

10:54.767 --> 10:55.567
(bus horn honks)

10:55.567 --> 10:56.567
Even if flushable wipes make

10:56.567 --> 10:58.200
your butt feel a little cleaner,

10:58.200 --> 11:00.200
they're murder on our sewers.

11:01.633 --> 11:02.633
Dang it, Adam.

11:02.633 --> 11:03.967
Golf balls again?

11:03.967 --> 11:04.967
This is why we shut off

11:04.967 --> 11:05.967
your water.

11:05.967 --> 11:07.200
I was using them

11:07.200 --> 11:07.933
to make a point.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.800
Watch what you flush, man!

11:09.800 --> 11:10.967
You know, I never did think

11:10.967 --> 11:12.267
about what I flushed.

11:12.267 --> 11:12.933
Yeah, and it's not

11:12.933 --> 11:13.967
just wipes.

11:13.967 --> 11:15.067
Things like exfoliating

11:15.067 --> 11:17.200
microbeads, antibacterial soaps

11:17.200 --> 11:18.933
and unused medications all go

11:18.933 --> 11:20.467
down our drains and the effect

11:20.467 --> 11:21.967
on our water systems

11:21.967 --> 11:23.800
can be weird.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.100

a miracle.

13:06.967 --> 13:08.267
What is your life?

13:08.267 --> 13:09.433
No, look, the fact that we

13:09.433 --> 13:11.900
can summon clean, fresh water on

13:11.900 --> 13:14.100
command is the greatest marvel

13:14.100 --> 13:16.467
of the modern age.

13:16.467 --> 13:17.800
For most of human history,

13:17.800 --> 13:18.900
sanitation was

13:18.900 --> 13:20.700
basically nonexistent.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.700
Most people just dumped

13:21.700 --> 13:23.933
their waste in the streets.

13:23.933 --> 13:24.967
(gasps)

13:24.967 --> 13:26.367
Even the rich were gross.

13:26.367 --> 13:27.567
The nobles of Versailles

13:27.567 --> 13:28.933
relieved themselves in the

13:28.933 --> 13:30.633
palace hallways.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.367
Aah...

13:32.367 --> 13:33.200
But as cities got bigger

13:33.200 --> 13:34.933
and denser, problems started

13:34.933 --> 13:36.133
piling up.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.733
By 1858, London was so smelly,

13:38.733 --> 13:40.133
it was referred to as

13:40.133 --> 13:41.600
The Great Stink.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.733
(sniffing)

13:42.733 --> 13:45.400
I smell a mystery, Watson.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.633
Oh, no, wait.

13:46.633 --> 13:47.733
That's poo.

13:47.733 --> 13:49.400
I smell lots of poo.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
Londoners dumped their waste

13:50.400 --> 13:52.567
directly into the river Thames,

13:52.567 --> 13:54.067
which was also the source of

13:54.067 --> 13:55.567
their drinking water.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.467
(gasps)

13:57.467 --> 13:58.967
The inevitable result was a

13:58.967 --> 14:00.567
cholera outbreak that killed

14:00.567 --> 14:02.900
50,000 people.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.467
Turns out the number-one poison

14:04.467 --> 14:06.900
in human history is our own

14:06.900 --> 14:08.433
number two.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.133
In desperation, Parliament

14:10.133 --> 14:11.533
ordered engineer Joseph

14:11.533 --> 14:13.067
Bazalgette to construct the

14:13.067 --> 14:15.433
city's first proper sewers.

14:15.433 --> 14:16.733
In what was, at that time, the

14:16.733 --> 14:18.033
biggest civil engineering

14:18.033 --> 14:19.800
project in history, Bazalgette

14:19.800 --> 14:22.133
built over 1100 miles of brick

14:22.133 --> 14:23.600
sewers under London.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.900
That's the length of almost a

14:24.900 --> 14:27.067
million Benedict Cumberbatches.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.033
Well, this is very

14:28.033 --> 14:29.400
undignified.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.767
Thanks to Bazalgette's heroic

14:30.767 --> 14:32.567
poop chute, cholera outbreaks

14:32.567 --> 14:34.367
were largely ended and child

14:34.367 --> 14:37.400
mortality dropped by a fifth.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.033
And it wasn't just England.

14:39.033 --> 14:40.200
To improve sanitation in

14:40.200 --> 14:42.233
Chicago, an engineer named Ellis

14:42.233 --> 14:43.867
Chesbrough jacked up entire

14:43.867 --> 14:45.567
neighborhoods by as much as

14:45.567 --> 14:48.533
14 feet and reversed the flow

14:48.533 --> 14:50.467
of the Chicago River, all to

14:50.467 --> 14:51.633
protect the windy city

14:51.633 --> 14:53.033
from typhoid.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.400
Bazalgette and Chesbrough are

14:54.400 --> 14:56.600
true heroes, but because we

14:56.600 --> 14:58.033
don't like talking about poop,

14:58.033 --> 14:59.033
most of us don't even know

14:59.033 --> 15:00.067
their names.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.900
Modern sanitation has arguable

15:01.900 --> 15:03.933
saved more lives than any other

15:03.933 --> 15:06.367
invention in human history.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.067
It turns out video games are

15:07.067 --> 15:08.300
right-- plumbers really do

15:08.300 --> 15:09.833
save the world.

15:14.967 --> 15:17.033
Oh, darn it.

15:17.033 --> 15:17.900
Look...

15:17.900 --> 15:20.233
Running water is by far the most

15:20.233 --> 15:21.667
amazing thing in this room.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.600
But we take it so thoroughly for

15:23.600 --> 15:24.767
granted that we've allowed

15:24.767 --> 15:26.733
advertisers to convince us that

15:26.733 --> 15:28.100
we're dirty, even though

15:28.100 --> 15:29.867
objectively, we are the cleanest

15:29.867 --> 15:31.633
people who have ever lived.

15:31.633 --> 15:32.467
Aww.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.033
It's actually kind of nice.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.267
Yeah, so look, we can take it

15:35.267 --> 15:36.900
easy with all these products.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.100
All you really need to be clean

15:38.100 --> 15:40.567
is soap, water, toothpaste,

15:40.567 --> 15:42.200
floss and extra-strength gel

15:42.200 --> 15:44.033
to keep your hair tall.

15:44.033 --> 15:45.800
The gel isn't necessary.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.633
Yes, it is.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.100
It makes you beautiful.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.400
Doesn't matter.

15:51.967 --> 15:53.900
I might as well die in here.

15:53.900 --> 15:54.733
I'm sorry you missed

15:55.733 --> 15:56.867
But you know, for what it's

greatest health advance of the

20th century, toilets still have

one big problem.

Next time on

"Adam Ruins Everything...

20:43.900 --> 20:45.200
Voting is way less democratic

20:45.200 --> 20:45.900
than we think.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.433
And I'll prove it to you.

20:47.433 --> 20:49.200
Back in time!

20:49.200 --> 20:50.867
Democracy, where every person

20:50.867 --> 20:53.067
votes directly for president.

20:53.067 --> 20:54.000
Psych!

20:54.033 --> 20:55.533
That would be ridiculous!

20:55.533 --> 20:56.567
The 15th Amendment gave

20:56.567 --> 20:57.933
black men the right to vote.

20:57.933 --> 20:59.900
This will last forever!

20:59.900 --> 21:01.100
Soon after that, states

21:01.100 --> 21:02.533
passed Jim Crow laws.

21:02.533 --> 21:03.233
This is why you should never

21:03.233 --> 21:04.433
meet your heroes.
