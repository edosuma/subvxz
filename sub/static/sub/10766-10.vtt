02:39.271 --> 02:42.297
I figured it out, Will. I'm gonna get Dad
what he always wanted.

02:42.908 --> 02:45.240
What, a Pizza Hut in the garage?

02:47.279 --> 02:48.303
Better.

02:48.380 --> 02:51.941
I'm going to clinch the election by getting
an influential person to endorse him.

02:52.017 --> 02:53.609
Watch and learn.

02:55.187 --> 02:57.519
Hello, is President Bush there?

02:59.524 --> 03:02.550
Carlton. Carlton Banks.

03:03.995 --> 03:05.519
It's personal.

03:08.467 --> 03:11.197
Carlton, are you by any chance an idiot?

03:13.538 --> 03:15.028
Not available?

03:15.107 --> 03:17.337
Perhaps you should let George know...

03:17.409 --> 03:21.038
that as Alternate Assistant Treasurer
to the Bel-Air Junior Republicans...

03:21.113 --> 03:24.674
I'm in a position to scratch his back
if he'll scratch mine, <i>capische?</i>

03:27.285 --> 03:28.445
Hello?

03:30.455 --> 03:33.447
- Hey, G, did you bring the mail in yet?
- No.

03:33.725 --> 03:37.024
I've been saving that genteel pleasure
to calm myself...

03:37.095 --> 03:40.064
lest I get too giddy
from scrubbing the john.

03:41.867 --> 03:44.461
Y ou know, you really need a woman, G.

03:44.736 --> 03:46.260
What's a woman?

03:47.005 --> 03:48.666
I'll get the mail.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.700
- Geoffrey.
- Sir.

03:52.677 --> 03:54.577
Daddy, now, you know
how much I love you.

03:54.646 --> 03:56.375
I would do anything for you, right?

03:56.448 --> 04:00.441
- All right, Hilary, how much do you want?
- No, I'm talking about...

04:00.519 --> 04:02.043
Well, $100.

04:02.621 --> 04:04.555
But I was talking about the election.

04:04.623 --> 04:06.454
Now, for me to vote for you
in good conscience...

04:06.525 --> 04:08.152
I need to know where you stand
on the issues.

04:08.226 --> 04:10.592
Okay, well, I'm against plea bargaining
and I'm for...

04:10.662 --> 04:14.598
y eah, but where do you stand on
a woman's right to choose the restaurant?

04:17.402 --> 04:20.803
I think we should leave that
up to the Supreme Court.

04:21.873 --> 04:24.171
Well, I think you're being
really unreasonable.

04:24.242 --> 04:26.574
Well, tough.
I don't care if it is chaperoned.

04:26.645 --> 04:29.773
Y ou cannot go to <i>E</i> nsenada
with Macaulay Culkin.

04:32.784 --> 04:34.308
Hey, mail call!

04:34.920 --> 04:37.081
For you, <i>Se/f</i> magazine...

04:39.424 --> 04:41.119
<i>Shape</i> magazine...

04:41.993 --> 04:43.790
and <i>Sassy</i> magazine.

04:44.296 --> 04:46.662
And for you, sir, <i>E/f</i> magazine...

04:49.334 --> 04:50.892
<i>Ape</i> magazine...

04:51.970 --> 04:53.699
and <i>Sissy</i> magazine.

04:55.907 --> 04:57.135
And, for you, sir...

04:57.209 --> 05:01.475
the bill for <i>Se/f,</i> the bill for <i>Shape,</i>
and the bill for <i>Sassy</i> magazines.

05:04.950 --> 05:08.511
- Uncle Phil, they're dogging you.
- What? Let me see that.

05:09.788 --> 05:14.054
"Defeat Philip Banks, the criminal's choice
for Superior Court Judge.

05:14.793 --> 05:18.524
"Banks wants to empty the prisons,
fill our streets with hoodlums...

05:18.597 --> 05:21.896
"and run a bookmaking operation
out of his chambers.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.629
"Vote Robertson
for Superior Court Judge."

05:24.703 --> 05:27.069
But Dad, aren't some of those lies?

05:30.876 --> 05:33.037
Carlton, honey, they're all lies.

05:33.111 --> 05:34.544
How can they get away with that?

05:34.613 --> 05:37.377
'Cause they know it's too late
for me to sue for a retraction.

05:37.449 --> 05:40.316
- Well, there's still time to fight back.
- I'm not gonna fight back.

05:40.385 --> 05:41.852
What?

05:41.920 --> 05:45.356
If I sink to their level,
I'm just as bad as they are.

05:45.423 --> 05:49.052
- Uncle Phil, let me tell you a little story.
- Oh, no.

05:50.562 --> 05:54.020
See, once upon a time there was
this young boy that lived in Philly, right?

05:54.099 --> 05:57.796
And right next to him lived the prettiest
little honey you ever seen in your life.

05:57.869 --> 05:59.928
And he loved her
with his whole heart and soul.

06:01.206 --> 06:02.673
Amen, sister.

06:04.042 --> 06:08.604
But see, on the other side of that girl
lived this little, filthy McRotten dude...

06:08.680 --> 06:10.739
and he wanted her
just for her body, right?

06:10.815 --> 06:13.613
So one day, the two dudes
was about to get it on, right?

06:13.685 --> 06:15.152
The girl came out and stopped them.

06:15.220 --> 06:19.122
She said, "No, flip a coin and
the winner can be my boyfriend," right?

06:19.190 --> 06:22.091
So the nasty dude
snatch off into his pocket, right?

06:22.160 --> 06:24.321
Calls heads, flips the coin...

06:24.896 --> 06:29.458
the nice guy lost the toss, and the girl,
and it broke his heart.

06:30.468 --> 06:32.527
- And do you know why he lost?
- Why?

06:32.604 --> 06:36.165
Because the nasty dude cheated.
He had a two-headed coin.

06:38.376 --> 06:40.571
The nice guy didn't get the girl.

06:40.645 --> 06:43.614
So, this story is about you, isn't it, Will?

06:49.854 --> 06:51.719
That's right, Uncle Phil.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.486
And to this day I just thank God
I had my two-headed coin...

06:54.559 --> 06:56.993
'cause that girl was smoking, man.

06:59.597 --> 07:02.760
- The poll results are in.
- Let's go see what...

07:03.935 --> 07:07.564
<i>And the race for Superior Court Judge</i>
<i>is neck and neck.</i>

07:07.639 --> 07:10.972
<i>Robertson and Banks are both po//ing 36%o.</i>

07:11.042 --> 07:13.636
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>anything cou/d tip the ba/ance.</i>

07:13.712 --> 07:15.043
<i>More after this.</i>

07:15.814 --> 07:18.544
<i>/f Banks gets into office,</i>
<i>we won't have to hide anymore...</i>

07:18.616 --> 07:20.243
<i>this city's ours!</i>

07:26.558 --> 07:29.925
<i>Un/ike my opponent,</i>
<i>/ don't think crime shou/d pay.</i>

07:29.995 --> 07:32.657
<i>/ say, throw the bums in jai/.</i>

07:32.864 --> 07:37.233
<i>Over the /ast 20 years, Judge Robertson</i>
<i>has thrown over 6,000 bums in jai/.</i>

07:38.403 --> 07:39.700
<i>Phi/ip Banks, none.</i>

07:40.038 --> 07:43.565
<i>Crimina/s support Phi/ip Banks.</i>
<i>Shou/d you?</i>

07:44.376 --> 07:45.809
<i>Throw the bums in jai/.</i>

07:45.877 --> 07:49.142
<i>Say, "Phi/ip Banks, no thanks,"</i>
<i>on E/ection Day.</i>

07:58.089 --> 08:00.557
Uncle Phil, you got to kick
that man's butt.

08:00.625 --> 08:04.083
He like begging, he like,
"Philip Banks, kick my butt."

08:04.629 --> 08:08.292
- Philip Banks, kick the man's butt.
- Can't do it, Vivian.

08:08.633 --> 08:09.861
I'm running an honest campaign.

08:09.934 --> 08:13.267
Philip, that man is evil and senile.
Why not fight fire with fire?

08:13.338 --> 08:15.772
Because it goes against
everything I stand for.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.535
What's your point?

08:20.678 --> 08:22.669
I have made my decision.

08:22.747 --> 08:25.614
I'm gonna base my campaign
on the issues, not the dirt.

08:25.683 --> 08:28.618
I have faith in L.A.
That L.A. Will have faith in me.

08:30.121 --> 08:31.918
<i>With over 90%o of the districts reporting...</i>

08:31.990 --> 08:34.823
<i>Judge Robertson has overwhe/ming/y</i>
<i>defeated Phi/ip Banks.</i>

08:34.893 --> 08:36.258
I hate L.A.

08:39.898 --> 08:42.389
And there's the loser now!

08:45.470 --> 08:49.031
Let's listen in
as he makes his concession speech.

08:49.707 --> 08:52.471
<i>E</i> veryone, I want to thank you
for your support.

08:52.544 --> 08:55.172
We put up a good fight and well...

08:55.246 --> 09:00.013
it was just an unfortunate
set of circumstances that saw...

09:02.754 --> 09:05.052
y ou don't have to shove,
we got two exits!

09:06.257 --> 09:07.690
Mr. Banks...

09:07.792 --> 09:11.228
not in recent memory
has someone managed to lose a race...

09:11.296 --> 09:13.264
by such a large margin.

09:13.731 --> 09:16.700
And so darn quickly. How does it feel?

09:17.168 --> 09:19.898
Well, once when I was a kid
I zipped my pants up too fast...

09:19.971 --> 09:22.371
let's just say
this brings back old memories.

09:25.910 --> 09:29.539
On a brighter note, I see you've brought
your lovely family with you...

09:29.614 --> 09:34.517
including your daughter,
KFPB weather personality, Hilary Banks.

09:34.652 --> 09:38.782
Hilary, you have just seen your father
suffer a humiliating defeat.

09:38.957 --> 09:42.415
So tell me,
are you free for dinner tonight?

09:44.129 --> 09:46.791
Look, my father just lost an election.

09:46.898 --> 09:49.458
I mean, I'm not totally insensitive.

09:50.468 --> 09:52.629
- How about tomorrow?
- Great.

09:54.739 --> 09:58.732
Well, from the Banks headquarters,
this is Trevor Collins...

10:00.011 --> 10:01.638
feeling pretty good.

10:04.015 --> 10:06.176
Now, everybody, put on your best faces.

10:06.251 --> 10:08.913
It's time to go give the victor his due.

10:08.987 --> 10:11.922
Damn! Uncle Phil, I got your back.

10:14.459 --> 10:17.986
Well, I got like half your back
'cause your back's like...

10:27.705 --> 10:29.900
Want some candy, little girl?

10:30.875 --> 10:32.240
Come here.

10:33.077 --> 10:36.604
Judge Robertson,
to what do you attribute your reelection?

10:36.681 --> 10:39.343
To getting more votes than the other guy.

10:39.417 --> 10:41.715
I mean, why did you get more votes, sir?

10:41.786 --> 10:43.947
Well, why didn't you say so, Connie?

10:45.156 --> 10:48.819
Y ou see, all the credit goes
to my campaign workers...

10:48.893 --> 10:51.384
who brought me up when I was down.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.394
Judge Robertson.

10:58.036 --> 11:00.402
Well, who do we have here?

11:00.838 --> 11:03.102
- Carl...
- I thought I was Carl.

11:08.713 --> 11:11.648
I just wanna congratulate you
on a campaign well fought, sir.

11:11.716 --> 11:14.344
Well, coming from you, Carl,
that means a lot.

11:14.419 --> 11:17.411
- I'm Philip.
- And I am the walrus.

11:21.326 --> 11:23.317
Let's get the hell out of here.

11:23.394 --> 11:24.884
That was fun.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.023
There goes Philip Banks...

11:28.566 --> 11:32.195
the biggest sap that ever lived.
What a stooge.

11:34.939 --> 11:36.304
<i>E</i> xcuse me?

11:36.674 --> 11:40.110
Y ou heard me. He's a sap, a dope, a loser.

11:40.278 --> 11:43.441
He never had what it takes
and he never will. Isn't that right?

11:47.218 --> 11:48.879
I think you should take that back, man.

11:48.953 --> 11:50.614
- Y ou do?
- Y eah, I do.

11:50.688 --> 11:52.815
Well, I think you should run along
and play.

11:52.890 --> 11:55.882
And don't get involved in politics
until you're a big boy.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.019
At least my uncle stands for something.

11:58.096 --> 12:01.657
Really? And what would that be?
A buffet?

12:06.204 --> 12:08.434
My uncle fights for what he believes in.

12:09.374 --> 12:10.864
Shame on me.

12:10.942 --> 12:13.376
My uncle's three times the man
you will ever be.

12:13.444 --> 12:15.241
He's got my vote.

12:18.249 --> 12:19.841
And another thing:

12:19.917 --> 12:22.317
<i>E</i> verything you said in your campaign
was a lie.

12:22.387 --> 12:27.324
Y ou have no integrity, no decency,
and you're really, really short.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.428
And I'll tell you another thing, if you don't
like it, man, you can drop dead.

12:42.006 --> 12:44.566
Oh, my God, he's dead.

12:45.610 --> 12:49.341
Come on, man, if I told you
to jump off a bridge, would you do it?

12:57.822 --> 12:59.790
How are you doing, baby?

13:00.491 --> 13:02.118
I just feel so guilty, Aunt Viv.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.559
Come on, now,
you gotta stop blaming yourself, Will.

13:04.629 --> 13:07.462
He wasn't a young man,
he didn't take very good care of himself.

13:07.532 --> 13:10.558
- Now, you heard what the doctor said.
- I know, Aunt Viv.

13:10.635 --> 13:14.435
If I could just forget it,
just clear my mind for one minute.

13:14.872 --> 13:18.467
Well, Will, you really knocked them dead
the other night, huh?

13:20.745 --> 13:21.939
Don't get him mad, Mom.

13:22.013 --> 13:24.880
Y ou don't want to make him
raise his voice.

13:27.452 --> 13:30.580
Carlton, take out the trash, honey.

13:30.655 --> 13:33.783
I did it last week,
it's the Terminator's turn.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.289
Dan Quayle, please.

13:38.396 --> 13:39.454
I'll hold.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.589
Carlton, why are you calling Dan Quayle?

13:41.666 --> 13:45.102
Simple. Thanks to the Grim Reaper
over here...

13:45.169 --> 13:47.160
and Judge Robertson
taking the old dirt nap...

13:47.238 --> 13:48.830
the governor has to appoint someone...

13:48.906 --> 13:52.000
and the right endorsement
could swing it to Dad.

13:52.777 --> 13:57.305
Y eah, Carlton Banks.
That's B-A-N-K-S. No <i>E</i>.

14:03.354 --> 14:05.345
That was a joke, ma'am.

14:06.824 --> 14:07.984
Hello?

14:10.228 --> 14:12.662
The phone's dead, Will.

14:18.970 --> 14:21.302
Carlton, man, I am not a killer.

14:26.844 --> 14:28.471
That's not funny.

14:31.749 --> 14:33.910
Ashley, you know I'd never hurt you, right?

14:33.985 --> 14:35.748
I know.

14:36.587 --> 14:38.919
Hilary, you know that I would never...

14:38.990 --> 14:40.821
Hurt a fly. We know.

14:40.892 --> 14:43.360
Look, Will, you're taking this
way too seriously.

14:43.428 --> 14:46.124
I mean, it's not like you got a bad haircut.

14:51.436 --> 14:54.064
Look, I think I know how to help Will.

14:54.138 --> 14:56.129
This calls for tough love.

14:56.207 --> 14:59.335
We've gotta draw him out.
We've gotta bait him, confront him...

14:59.410 --> 15:04.006
attack him until he defends himself.
Only then will he start to feel better.

15:05.850 --> 15:09.115
- I don't know, Carlton.
- Look, just follow my lead.

15:11.489 --> 15:13.389
Will, you should be ashamed of yourself.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.289
How could you do such a thing?

15:15.359 --> 15:17.259
Hope you never get mad at me.

15:24.402 --> 15:26.495
Why are y'all screaming at me?

15:28.940 --> 15:32.034
I was minding my damn business
eating some fruit.

15:35.980 --> 15:37.880
Well, I could be wrong.

15:39.717 --> 15:41.207
Y ou won't believe this.

15:41.285 --> 15:44.152
They want me to give the eulogy
at Judge Robertson's funeral.

15:44.222 --> 15:45.314
Y ou're kidding.

15:45.389 --> 15:48.017
Philip, you know,
I really hate to speak ill of the dead...

15:48.092 --> 15:51.619
but if that little man hadn't died
I would have killed him myself.

15:51.696 --> 15:53.789
- So, who's up for Chinese food?
- I'd like some.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.765
I'm gonna give the eulogy, Vivian.

15:55.833 --> 15:57.664
- Philip, no.
- Dad, how could you say yes?

15:57.735 --> 16:01.466
I know Carl changed over the years
but the man was my mentor.

16:01.539 --> 16:04.565
And I'm going to that funeral.
And you're all going with me.

16:16.354 --> 16:19.289
Philip, any chance of getting
those flowers after the funeral?

16:20.291 --> 16:21.918
Sit down, Vivian.

16:29.767 --> 16:32.759
I'd like to welcome you
to the memorial for...

16:32.837 --> 16:34.327
Carl Robertson.

16:34.405 --> 16:38.603
Saying a few words on behalf
of the departed will be Philip Banks.

16:39.343 --> 16:43.279
- Vivian, where's my speech?
- It's on the kitchen counter where I...

16:43.347 --> 16:44.871
Sorry, Philip.

16:53.491 --> 16:56.426
What can you say
about Judge Carl Robertson?

16:56.594 --> 16:58.027
What indeed?

17:00.498 --> 17:02.056
He was a judge.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.367
A judge named Carl.

17:06.537 --> 17:08.971
But he was more. So much more.

17:12.209 --> 17:13.699
Carl...

17:16.914 --> 17:18.939
He wasn't a very heavy man.

17:22.987 --> 17:26.752
Look, I'm probably the wrong person
to be up here.

17:26.824 --> 17:29.520
I mean, I just got finished
losing an election to the man...

17:29.594 --> 17:32.085
in which he used every dirty trick
in the book.

17:32.163 --> 17:35.291
So, at this time
I'd like to invite someone...

17:35.366 --> 17:38.062
with an especially warm memory
of Carl Robertson...

17:38.135 --> 17:39.966
to come up here and share it with us.

17:44.475 --> 17:46.102
Anyone with...

17:46.243 --> 17:49.337
a somewhat fond memory
of Carl Robertson.

17:51.415 --> 17:54.316
Anybody with any recollection
of him at all.

17:55.152 --> 17:56.244
Y es.

17:57.188 --> 18:00.521
The jerk sentenced me to six months
in jail for a crime I didn't commit.

18:00.591 --> 18:02.115
I'm just here to make sure he dead.

18:07.698 --> 18:09.029
Thank you.

18:09.433 --> 18:10.525
Y es.

18:11.502 --> 18:13.936
He hired me to replant his garden.

18:14.271 --> 18:16.899
And when it came time
for him to pay me...

18:16.974 --> 18:19.306
he called Immigration on me.

18:20.711 --> 18:22.008
<i>Gracias.</i>

18:24.815 --> 18:27.443
I knew Carl, biblically.

18:27.818 --> 18:29.217
Please.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.018
Sorry.

18:37.094 --> 18:39.961
With him it was just a bunch of...

18:40.598 --> 18:43.362
sex all the time, like dating Thumper.

18:45.403 --> 18:47.837
Never felt I really got to know him...

18:47.905 --> 18:50.806
never felt he cared about my needs.

18:51.742 --> 18:53.937
- Y ou were his wife?
- His mistress.

18:54.011 --> 18:55.069
Okay.

18:57.214 --> 18:58.704
For 20 years.

18:59.417 --> 19:01.578
Longest years of my life.

19:02.353 --> 19:05.186
Y ou don't have any pleasant memories
at all of him?

19:05.956 --> 19:07.048
Well...

19:08.092 --> 19:09.150
no.

19:10.428 --> 19:12.953
The man's idea of sweet talk was:

19:14.065 --> 19:16.124
"When you gonna bring
your sister around?"

19:19.770 --> 19:22.796
Well, thank you for sharing.

19:24.742 --> 19:27.870
Hold up here a minute.
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.

19:27.945 --> 19:30.140
A man is dead here, people.

19:30.347 --> 19:33.783
I mean, did he not feel pain
when he was hurt?

19:34.452 --> 19:36.818
I mean, did he not shiver
when he was cold?

19:36.887 --> 19:38.548
Did he not dream?

19:39.023 --> 19:42.356
I mean, he was only human,
but yes, he was human.

19:43.227 --> 19:47.357
And I fail to believe that the world
can profit from a man's death.

19:47.465 --> 19:50.866
And I think each and every one of you
should be really ashamed of yourselves.

19:50.935 --> 19:52.527
And who are you?

19:58.743 --> 20:00.711
I'm the dude that killed him.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.884
- Tough room.
- Y eah.

20:30.407 --> 20:32.398
Carlton, you're just wasting
your time, man.

20:32.476 --> 20:34.034
Y e of little faith.

20:34.111 --> 20:37.740
I'm about to get the endorsement
that will lock up Dad's appointment.

20:39.416 --> 20:41.247
Hello, is Vanna there?

20:44.054 --> 20:46.887
Well, I think heaven
is this wonderful place...

20:46.957 --> 20:48.788
where all the people are good-Iooking...

20:48.859 --> 20:52.317
nothing clashes,
and you never have to wait for a table.

20:52.596 --> 20:54.723
And hell is like the Valley.

21:00.004 --> 21:01.733
What do you think, Daddy?

21:01.806 --> 21:04.001
I think we're all damn lucky
Hilary has a job.

21:06.510 --> 21:08.000
Thanks, Daddy.

21:09.346 --> 21:13.180
Now, see, to me heaven has to be
like a cross between...

21:13.250 --> 21:16.845
a Sir Mix-A-Lot video
and Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.

21:18.589 --> 21:22.855
See, it's like I can have a leg in one hand
and a breast in the other.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.922
So what do you think, G?

21:29.700 --> 21:33.067
I think I must have been very bad
in a previous life.

21:38.542 --> 21:42.171
Y ou know, I don't know
why people are so down on funerals.

21:46.884 --> 21:48.476
Banks residence.

21:49.620 --> 21:52.316
- For you, sir.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.

21:54.558 --> 21:55.616
Y es?

21:57.561 --> 21:59.085
Y es, Governor.

21:59.263 --> 22:01.163
Y es, it was unfortunate.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.791
Why, of course, sir, yes.

22:05.002 --> 22:07.903
It's an honor, thank you, sir. Y es.

22:09.406 --> 22:11.067
Well, what was all that?

22:12.509 --> 22:16.707
The Governor just appointed me
to Judge Robertson's seat!

22:22.052 --> 22:24.111
- Y es, you're the man!
- Y es.

22:25.956 --> 22:28.390
- This calls for champagne.
- Y eah.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.729
Could I get it for you?

22:52.783 --> 22:55.115
Why are y'all screaming at me?

22:56.620 --> 22:59.589
I was minding my damn business
eating some fruit.

22:59.657 --> 23:01.420
Y ou screamed at me.

23:06.130 --> 23:08.030
Well, I could be wrong.

23:08.265 --> 23:10.256
<i>What in the he//</i>
<i>did you just do with your /ips?</i>

23:10.334 --> 23:11.562
<i>A// right!</i>
