Rot in there, you psychotic asshole.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.123
And things haven't always
been easy in my life.

[gunshot]

00:41.791 --> 00:42.667
What did you do?

00:45.462 --> 00:50.258
[Joe] But all that felt worth it
when I met Love Quinn.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.468
I wolf you.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.761
[Joe] I loved her.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.722
I embraced all of her,
even the hard parts.

00:55.805 --> 00:59.142
[Dottie] All you ever have to do is keep
your brother safe. You failed.

Find a city. When you get there,
I'll help you get legal ID,

01:10.695 --> 01:13.323
[Joe] And by then, it was too late.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.824
We can be together now.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.326
I don't think we can.

-[Joe] Really, really, truly.
-No, I'm pregnant!

01:20.830 --> 01:24.542
[Joe] And then I realized
who I really need to protect.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.169
Our daughter.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.838
For her, I moved to some soulless,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.882

01:30.965 --> 01:33.968
For her, I'd marry the monster,
her mother.

01:34.052 --> 01:38.431
For her, I'd lock myself into this prison.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.434
Not sure how I'm ever going
to get us both out.

01:41.518 --> 01:47.440
But there's one part of the old me
I can't quite shake.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.110
I still believe in The One.

01:50.944 --> 01:55.907
That the right person is out there for me.

01:59.744 --> 02:05.834
I never thought to wonder
what happens after boy gets girl.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.419
'Cause we know:

02:09.629 --> 02:11.756
"And they lived happily ever after."

02:11.840 --> 02:14.509
Fade to black, roll credits.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.346
I should have asked more questions.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.474
'Cause I've been in
some harrowing situations in my life.

in the dark before, I can do it now.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.702
I have to.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.663
To protect my daughter.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.748
Congratulations, Dad. It's a boy.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.363

We moved to Madre Linda

We wanted to get here all on our own.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.194
-Where are you going? Great, feed Henry.
-Oh, just--

13:40.277 --> 13:43.447
I got winded going up ten stairs.
I need to hit a gym.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.032
[Joe] Shit.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.789
Whenever I hang with Henry,
I'm reminded of two things.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.374
One, he hates me.

13:53.457 --> 13:57.378
Two, I have to protect him at all costs
from what happened to me.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.921
[boy 1] Joey!

13:59.004 --> 14:01.841
-Where's your mama now?
-[boy 2] Run, you little bitch!

14:01.924 --> 14:04.260
-Run, you little bitch!
-Come get some.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.011
-What are you scared of?
-Get him!

14:06.095 --> 14:07.680
Come on, Joey!

14:07.763 --> 14:08.973
Open the door.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.183
-You freak!
-Come get what's coming to you.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.936
-[teacher] Boys! What's going on here?
-Teacher! Run!

14:14.603 --> 14:16.146
[woman] Boys! What did--?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.319
[knocking on door]

14:22.403 --> 14:26.115
[Paulie] Hey, hey. Joe, Joe. Let me in.
Hey, it's me, it's me. Let me in.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.994
Dude, you okay?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.122
Bro, why do you do this to yourself?

14:33.205 --> 14:35.291
-They're the ones who do it.
-You asked for it.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.296
-Quit saying your mom's coming back.
-She is.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.173
If she cared, would you be here?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.301
-You don't understand.
-Fine.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.678
Just shut up about it, okay?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.931
-I don't see why--
-The rest of us are trying to deal

14:51.015 --> 14:52.975
with how no one fucking wants us.

14:53.934 --> 14:58.647
Face it. When our parents gave us up,
they threw us away forever, man.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.695
[woman] Natalie!
Oh, my God, look at this place!

15:04.778 --> 15:05.613
[Joe] Who are you?

15:07.406 --> 15:10.784
On the surface, a realtor,
and you're good at it.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.287
You wanna make things lovelier.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.206
You left college early
when you met your husband,

15:16.290 --> 15:18.751
tech entrepreneur Matthew Engler,

15:18.834 --> 15:21.295
about whom there is even less to learn

15:21.378 --> 15:23.923
unless I wanna take the word of publicists

15:24.006 --> 15:26.342
paid to manicure every inch
of his online footprint.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.511
Is this what you wanted?

15:30.304 --> 15:33.557
Marry someone older, busy, never home

15:33.641 --> 15:35.976
while you sell houses to rich assholes

15:36.060 --> 15:40.022
and pick up his dry cleaning?
Is that love for you?

15:40.105 --> 15:41.815
Do you love him?

15:41.899 --> 15:45.319
Do you long for something deeper, true?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.112
Like I do.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.367
-[Andrew] I know.
-[Kiki] I think someone--

15:51.450 --> 15:54.453
-Like, I think maybe...
-[Sherry] Oh, Love Quinn!

15:54.536 --> 15:56.455
Come hither. [chuckles]

15:56.538 --> 15:59.875
-Hi.
-Hi. This is Kiki, and this is Andrew.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.794
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.339
Love's gorgeous baby boy is,
what, seven months?

16:05.422 --> 16:07.091
-[Love] Yeah.
-Oh, I miss that age.

16:07.174 --> 16:11.178
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Love, I was glad to see you in class.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.722
-Fucking kicked my ass.
-Oh, I know.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.933
That class is for really fit people,

16:16.016 --> 16:17.977
but you'll get used to it.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.356
-I had so much baby weight to lose.
-Same. I had quite the journey.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.817
I mean, much worse than yours.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.527
It was. It really was.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.823
Is it just me
or is everyone calling me fat?

16:31.448 --> 16:33.200
-Oh, oh, no.
-No, no, no.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.619
And would that even be a pejorative?

16:35.703 --> 16:38.664
I mean, beauty doesn't have a size, Love.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.125
Come latte with us.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.002
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.170
Okay.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.173
-Yeah, I could go for some coffee.
-Amazing.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.134
Great! We got a group.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.260
[Sherry laughs]

16:58.392 --> 17:00.894
[Joe] I might not have solved
the mystery of you yet,

17:00.978 --> 17:05.274
but I know one thing:
I wasn't wrong to be intrigued.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.612
Forgive the pun.
This speaks volumes about you.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.782
I didn't even know
this hell-burb had a library.

17:20.456 --> 17:25.127
Libraries represent
the very best of civilized society,

17:25.210 --> 17:29.256
the housing of an egalitarian access
to knowledge.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.217
It's what separates us from the apes.

17:34.303 --> 17:38.807
And yet, it physically hurts to see
the condition of most of these books.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.810
Mr. Mooney once said
the way a society treats its books

17:41.894 --> 17:43.520
is the most accurate harbinger
of its fate.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.189
You see enough broken bindings,

17:45.272 --> 17:48.692
you know that Rome's burning
or will be soon enough.

17:49.818 --> 17:53.864
But there's still something to fight for
in this wretched world.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.742
Oh, what's little man's name?

17:56.825 --> 18:00.621
-Oh, it's Henry.
-I dated a Henry.

18:00.704 --> 18:04.249
-Henrys are great.
-Well, Henry thanks you.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.501
Excuse us.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.836
Hard to be invisible
with the greatest lady magnet

18:07.920 --> 18:10.589
in the history of the species
strapped to you.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.431
The Fifth Season, Gone Girl, Seabiscuit.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.392
Okay, I'm stumped. Why those?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.019
-Who are you?
-[Henry crying]

18:24.728 --> 18:26.063
Oh, Henry, okay.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.201
All right, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.327
[Henry stops crying]

18:45.082 --> 18:47.376
-Hi.
-So are you gonna chase after her,

18:47.459 --> 18:50.003
-or could I help you with something?
-Yeah.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.966
-I'd like to apply for a library card.
-You've come to the right place.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.175
Good.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.636
Fill that out for me.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.807
We have a great kids section
just in the corner.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.727
And... you can take that home with you.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.231
Natalie picked it out for you.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.737
[Joe] You are flirting with me.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.322
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.956
When they start to crawl,
it's a miracle anyone survives.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.334
I'm so blessed
we have three incredible nannies.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.504
Oh, my God.
It's twice as insane with twins.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.923
It's kind of why I started writing.
To just share.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.802
So others won't make
the mountain of mistakes I did.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.263
Yeah. What is the name of your blog again?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.432
[Kiki] Oh, she's Heart-Shaped Mistakes.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.726
-You seriously haven't read it?
-No.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.228
-It's small.
-She invented momfluencing.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.938
-Don't be humble.
-No. It's fun.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.817
I can stay home with my twins.
What do you do for work?

19:56.069 --> 20:01.366
-Well, I used to-- I'm trained as a chef.
-Oh.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.660
Yeah, and I, uh...

20:04.953 --> 20:07.664
I haven't really had much time
since he was born, I guess.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.459
-Well, yes.
-Your job right now is to connect

20:10.542 --> 20:11.960
with your baby and your man.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.714
So easy for you to say.
Has your vagina even recovered yet?

20:15.797 --> 20:19.426
-Oh, my God. You're embarrassing her.
-Don't be vagina-phobic.

20:19.509 --> 20:25.098
God! I wish someone would've told me.
Sex is hard to get back into.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.353
-But connecting intimately? So crucial.
-[Andrew] Mm-hm.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.814
Endorphins, oxytocin,
it's incredible for the breast milk.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.609
In fact, if you're not orgasming,

20:35.692 --> 20:39.238
your breast milk isn't doing it
for your baby's precious growing brain.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.158
-Well, we're all over that, so...
-Oh.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.076
Okay.

20:48.330 --> 20:52.501
[Joe] Tender Is the Night is widely
considered Fitzgerald's darkest work.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.670
It's about marriage and infidelity.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.089
Invitation? Or a warning?

20:57.172 --> 20:59.591
-Okay. I finally got him down.
-Mm. Good work.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.512
And I got you...

21:05.555 --> 21:06.765
a pain au chocolat.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.269
[Joe] Don't get me wrong.
This isn't some German fairy tale

21:10.352 --> 21:13.772
where a witch keeps me locked up
till it's time to eat me.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.692
Love is nice, giving.

21:17.651 --> 21:21.113
I fell in love
with a certain version of her.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.574
What do you think?

21:29.746 --> 21:32.916
-It's okay.
-Exactly. This is the best bakery in town?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.585
Shoddy lamination. Too sweet.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.839
-Definitely didn't use French butter.
-Yeah. Yeah, banish them.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.174
Off with their heads. Done.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.022
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.075
Am I interrupting your reading?

22:08.076 --> 22:10.162
-No, no. No, you're not.
-Seems like I am.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.080
-Just come back. Come back, Love.
-Fuck.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.832
-Stay. Stay.
-No, Joe. Why?

22:16.710 --> 22:19.254
-Why won't you talk to me?
-What? We talk--

22:19.338 --> 22:21.673
Something is going on.
You're always distracted.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.800
-I'm not distracted.
-Why won't you tell me?

22:24.593 --> 22:26.011
[Henry crying over monitor]

22:27.929 --> 22:28.930
I've got him.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.271
I'm gonna take him to his grandma's.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.565
-Love.
-No, don't worry about it, Joe.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.609
Enjoy the quiet.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.294
[Joe] Where are you?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.504
[cell phone buzzing]

23:13.683 --> 23:15.685
-Hello.
-[Natalie] Hey, neighbor.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.187
Care for a drink?

23:19.272 --> 23:20.816
How'd you get my number?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.443
My husband, Matthew, works in tech.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.488
So...

23:27.364 --> 23:29.699
not at all invasive tech.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.202
Why are you nervous?

23:32.285 --> 23:34.663
Got some checkered past
you're trying to hide?

23:36.456 --> 23:38.542
No, I'm not worried about me so much as...

23:40.043 --> 23:42.879
you know, the future of civilization.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.381
Ah.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.217
Well, that's a lost cause.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.304
You know, I feel I should warn you.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.016
There's no such thing
as privacy in Madre Linda.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.518
Including here.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.645
See.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.731
All the cameras in my house.

24:02.691 --> 24:06.653
One out here is broken. That's why
I spend so much time by the pool.

24:07.529 --> 24:11.950
It's the only place in this entire town
I don't feel like I'm being watched.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.202
Boop. Boop.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.371
There.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.914
[Joe] You want us to be alone?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.583
Even that's not really privacy.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.043
Matthew will see I turned them off
and wonder why.

24:23.336 --> 24:26.339
It's so weird,
I don't remember putting on a leash,

24:26.423 --> 24:27.424
just kind of...

24:28.216 --> 24:30.302
slipped around my neck at some point.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.429
[Joe] You're a prisoner too.

24:32.512 --> 24:35.599
I guess
marriage isn't really built for secrets.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.185
Or people aren't really built
for marriage.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.147
Come with.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.232
I need another drink.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.371
To new friends.

24:59.873 --> 25:03.585
"Who can often have
a better time together than old."

25:03.668 --> 25:05.629
-You got my book.
-Hmm.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.006
-Oh, shit.
-Whoa.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.801
Here. Is that okay? Can I see it?

25:13.970 --> 25:18.225
Aye. Just put pressure on it.
That should stop the bleeding.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.689
Do you have a first aid kit?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.358
Yeah.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.028
[Joe] It feels right.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.655
Taking care of you.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.367
There. I think you'll live.

25:35.951 --> 25:39.037
-Does it hurt?
-Nothing more wine won't cure.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.716
You feel it too, don't you?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.801
What?

25:54.261 --> 25:57.222
That feeling
when you're first with someone.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.267
All the tension, possibility...

26:00.350 --> 26:02.018
I wish I could bottle it.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.188
It's better than anything.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.189
[Joe] I feel it.

26:09.192 --> 26:12.153
I thought it would stay, with Matthew.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.575
Do you think it inevitably goes away?

26:16.658 --> 26:18.076
I think if it's right...

26:20.078 --> 26:21.204
it stays.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.250
So how long did it stay with you and Love?

26:27.502 --> 26:29.296
It's hard to say. Um...

26:29.921 --> 26:31.631
I didn't know the real her...

26:32.966 --> 26:34.342
when I fell in love.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.511
-I know how that feels.
-I got swept up.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.430
By the time I realized, it was too late.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.768
I couldn't leave. I couldn't leave her.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.771
People leave all the time.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.152
Not Love.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.197
Our daughter-- We thought
we were gonna have a little girl.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.407
Anyway...

26:58.950 --> 26:59.993
I'm in it now...

27:00.994 --> 27:01.828
with Love.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.371
Are you?

27:06.583 --> 27:08.418
Kids aren't handcuffs.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.504
Matthew has a stepson.

27:12.756 --> 27:16.176
-We don't see him much.
-That sounds terrible, for the kid.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.927
It's fine, actually.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.054
You know why?

27:19.137 --> 27:21.806
People are happier
when they aren't lying to themselves...

27:23.058 --> 27:24.225
and everyone else.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.977
So, what are you doing here?

27:27.854 --> 27:28.730
[groans]

27:30.106 --> 27:32.525
-I can't leave him either.
-Oh!

27:34.736 --> 27:36.404
I can't do that to him.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.241
Even if it means I stay in this...

27:40.909 --> 27:45.580
Dwell Magazine, Twilight Zone
fucking purgatory forever.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.458
-Is it that bad here?
-Ha.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.710
If you're not careful,

27:51.628 --> 27:54.923
you'll start caring about private schools,

27:55.006 --> 27:57.884
stock portfolios,
start reading on a Kindle.

27:57.967 --> 27:58.802
Fuck.

27:58.885 --> 27:59.928
[Natalie chuckles]

28:07.394 --> 28:09.187
You wanna see my reading room?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.446
We've always slept in separate rooms.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.281
I'm an insomniac.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.159
Also, a slob.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.542
[Joe] Everything suddenly feels real.

28:30.625 --> 28:34.170
I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?

28:34.254 --> 28:36.005
Hey, where'd you go?

28:37.006 --> 28:38.258
Get out of your head.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.219
Come here.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.409
[Joe] No. Husband, father. I can't.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.326
I'm sorry.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.829
I gave you the wrong impression.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.832
-I'm pretty sure you didn't.
-No.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.878
I'm just looking for a friend.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.464
Shit.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.930
[Joe] No, never again.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.225
-I promised myself I would do this right.
-[door closes]

29:29.309 --> 29:31.644
Love. Hey, I thought--

29:31.728 --> 29:33.396
I got there...

29:34.564 --> 29:36.941
and then I thought about seeing my mom,

29:37.025 --> 29:39.819
and I went and got Häagen-Dazs instead.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.324
Are you okay? You look a little flushed.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.285
I just had a drink with the neighbor.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.245
-Hmm. [chuckles]
-You're right. She's crazy.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.832
Look, I'm sorry for running off.

29:52.916 --> 29:53.917
I just--

30:02.383 --> 30:04.469
I was just thinking about our vows.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.555
Oh. Yeah.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.559
The ones we wrote on In-N-Out bags
on the way to the courthouse.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.147
You said you would always share a bite
of your pastry with me.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.817
That's-- That's so generous.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.612
-I am generous.
-You really are, and I'm an asshole.

30:22.695 --> 30:26.324
-No, you're not. You're just--
-I am. And it's been so crazy.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.328
And I was just thinking about that bite.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.624
And you were hungry?

30:36.751 --> 30:38.169
-Yeah.
-Me too.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.629
[dramatic music playing]

30:47.262 --> 30:49.055
[Joe] That feeling you wanna bottle,

30:49.138 --> 30:51.391
turns out, it can come back.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.852
Maybe this is what we were looking for
in each other, Natalie.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.520
What I needed from you.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.189
A way back to Love.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.567
Maybe, thanks to you,

31:00.650 --> 31:02.318
I can make this work.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.282
[moaning]

31:16.666 --> 31:19.377
I should have told Sherry we were busy.
This is gonna suck.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.921
Something tells me
she's not someone you say no to.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.548
It'll be fine.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.884
-[doorbell rings]
-I have you...

31:26.968 --> 31:28.011
and pie.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.180
-Quinn-Goldbergs.
-[Love] Hey.

31:31.264 --> 31:34.434
-Step right on up.
-Here you go. This is for you.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.227
-It's gluten-free.
-Oh, great.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.145
Yes.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.398
[Joe] Fun fact,
Sherry had to post an apology video

31:40.481 --> 31:42.275
in August 2020 after it was discovered

31:42.358 --> 31:45.069
that she had a massive party
while the rest of us were home,

31:45.153 --> 31:46.988
clutching hand sanitizer.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.116
Rumor was, the whole neighborhood got
a secret vaccine

31:50.199 --> 31:53.494
manufactured for the Queen of England
and were thus immune to COVID.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.080
I don't believe in conspiracies,

31:56.164 --> 31:59.375
except when they're about
unfair advantages of being rich.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.170
Those are true.
Trust me, I married a Quinn.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.840
Go get you some Pinot.
It's from my friends' winery.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.343
They 3D-print their wine barrels.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.595
Hi.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.764
[indistinct chatter]

32:15.850 --> 32:16.935
Thank you.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.939
Oh, that's Kiki and her husband, Brandon.

32:21.648 --> 32:25.401
And there's Andrew and his lawyer husband.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.028
I can't remember his name.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.529
Jackson.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.954
Andrew, Jackson. Now, that is unfortunate.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.789
Oh, my God.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.834
-How could I forget?
-They seem okay,

32:41.918 --> 32:44.545
if you discount the obscene
one-percenter bubble they live in.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.758
Mm. I have to discount that
or we'd have to guillotine both of us too.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.593
Then they're a nice couple.

32:51.552 --> 32:52.637
[Sherry laughing]

32:53.513 --> 32:55.306
Contrary to our gracious host.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.016
[Joe] Never trust a queen bee.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.143
Let me show you around, Love.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.853
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.189
[Cary] Ah, you must be Joe.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.942
Finally, we meet. Cary Conrad.

33:06.484 --> 33:11.406
'Cause is your life even a brand
without a perfectly imperfect soulmate?

33:11.489 --> 33:12.699
Oh, my God.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.661
Mission accomplished. I cannot tell
who the bigger douchebag is.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.747
-Nice to meet you.
-Let me show you the grill setup.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.332
Okay.

33:23.167 --> 33:27.213
A sea of awkward nerds made good.
Tech made the money, wives did the rest.

33:27.296 --> 33:28.840
Clothes, hair, Barry's Bootcamp,

33:28.923 --> 33:33.386
and they go from kid-stuffed-in-locker
to 21st-century master of the universe.

33:33.469 --> 33:36.264
-It's kind of sweet.
-Kiki tells Dakota, "Don't bother Daddy.

33:36.347 --> 33:39.517
He's micro-dosing ketamine.
It's his special time."

33:39.600 --> 33:41.978
[Joe] If you overlook the haze
of narcissistic delusion

33:42.061 --> 33:43.271
that just the right biohack,

33:43.354 --> 33:44.564
you'll live forever.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.942
It's all paleo. Well, keto, really.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.362
I find when I I.F.,
I'm good on any amount of fats.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.406
-I.F.?
-Intermittent fasting.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.199
You don't?

33:55.742 --> 34:00.580
Well, I mean, obviously you must not
because you're genetically blessed.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.915
Let me get in there.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.500
Oh, yeah.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.753
Lucky. Super high metab.

34:07.378 --> 34:10.882
The guys come and train with me.
I'm a monster. You'll love it.

34:10.965 --> 34:14.302
[Joe] Is he flirting with me
or inviting me to join Fight Club?

34:14.385 --> 34:15.845
Help yourself to meat.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.055
I'll be back.

34:20.767 --> 34:23.227
I didn't know
Lena and Chris were back from Paris.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.981
Oh, and apparently had the best time.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.233
-They're open, the marriage.
-[Love] Oh.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.195
No judgment from me.

34:32.987 --> 34:33.821
Really?

34:34.614 --> 34:36.741
-None?
-I spent my summers growing up

34:36.824 --> 34:39.952
on a commune,
so I got a big dose of all that.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.746
Whatever works, right?

34:42.663 --> 34:45.541
You are such a breath of fresh air, Love.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.043
I'm glad you moved here.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.339
-My pleasure.
-Oh.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.465
Hi.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.634
Natalie and Matthew Engler.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.137
-Oh, she looks amazing.
-She is a bad person.

34:59.597 --> 35:03.101
Matthew was married
to this incredible woman named Mimi,

35:03.184 --> 35:06.104
mother of his child, and then, well--

35:06.187 --> 35:07.688
He met Natalie, and--

35:07.772 --> 35:11.400
We're far too feminist
to ever say a woman stole a man.

35:11.484 --> 35:15.655
She's nice enough.
Great realtor, you know. A cheater.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.907
Good to know
when a person lives next door.

35:17.990 --> 35:18.825
[Kiki] Mm-hm.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.578
Oh, I must say hello to Les.
He's sourcing us a French bulldog.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.705
-I'm empty. I'm gonna go fill up.
-Okay.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.380
[Joe] You're here, with him?

35:32.463 --> 35:34.257
Looking perfectly content.

35:34.924 --> 35:38.094
Was our evening nothing?
A mistake for us both?

35:41.430 --> 35:43.432
Ever sat in a virtual reality pod?

35:43.933 --> 35:45.977
-Joe?
-No, I can't say that I have.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.313
Oh, Cary's got one in his garage.
It's insane.

35:49.397 --> 35:53.151
Not even just for porn.
But also the porn is spectacular.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.696
[Joe] We as a species
deserve to go extinct.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.615
[women laughing]

36:00.491 --> 36:02.827
So my friend Rachel in L.A.,

36:03.411 --> 36:07.790
she said the brother's a crackhead
who got himself killed.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.460
And the dad's shady too.
Apparently, Anavrin is a front.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.754
Money just papers over that garbage fire.

36:13.838 --> 36:18.050
And, of course, she took her daddy's cash,
bought a whole new life here,

36:18.134 --> 36:20.845
where the rest of us work
for what we have.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.430
-[Kiki] Amen.
-[Sherry] Amen.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.347
Hi.

36:24.390 --> 36:25.808
Can I top off your wine?

36:26.893 --> 36:28.561
-Hi.
-[Sherry] Oh, my God!

36:28.644 --> 36:29.478
Okay.

36:32.857 --> 36:37.069
May I state the obvious?
Sherry Conrad is a terrible person.

36:38.446 --> 36:42.033
-Can you fucking believe that?
-Who runs this town, so...

36:43.075 --> 36:45.828
you kind of can't
get righteously indignant

36:45.912 --> 36:48.748
unless you also wanna be lonely.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.501
Well, I have friends.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.587
Where, in L.A.?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.924
You need some here too.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.010
I assume you came here for the schools?

37:01.510 --> 37:04.013
Well, now, you know those come at a cost.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.848
Pinot, please.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.769
Look, they hate me.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.232
Think I stole Matthew from their friend,
who by the way, was cheating first, but...

37:15.274 --> 37:16.901
Point is,

37:16.984 --> 37:19.904
everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.325
You mean, around Sherry and her mafia?

37:24.408 --> 37:27.495
It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

37:27.578 --> 37:31.415
They just called my family a garbage fire.
I don't really see that happening.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.625
Okay. Fair.

37:34.794 --> 37:37.672
So do what I do. Get her to respect you.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.424
Authenticity scares the shit out of her.

37:40.508 --> 37:45.096
Do you, no apology, loud and proud,
and you'll cow her into,

37:45.179 --> 37:49.141
if not submission,
at least basic fake friendship.

37:50.017 --> 37:54.313
Okay, great. One problem.
I don't really know who I am these days.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.778
I just had a baby,

38:01.654 --> 38:02.863
and everything's a--

38:03.739 --> 38:07.159
There's nothing authentic
or intimidating about me.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.829
I'm just a stay-at-home mom going insane.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.167
I guess there's some...

38:16.502 --> 38:18.045
things I need to figure out.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.506
So if you could do anything,

38:21.549 --> 38:22.800
what would you do?

38:22.883 --> 38:23.759
Just for fun?

38:25.344 --> 38:26.178
Okay.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.848
So this is stupid.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.060
But I have this fantasy
of opening a bakery.

38:33.894 --> 38:36.105
I'm a trained pastry chef in another life,

38:36.188 --> 38:39.525
and feels ridiculous to think about
in a town where nobody eats gluten.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.651
I eat gluten.

38:40.735 --> 38:41.736
Seriously?

38:43.446 --> 38:44.363
You know what?

38:45.448 --> 38:47.908
There's a space available
that might be perfect.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.452
Could be wrong.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.246
Or this was fate.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.373
Call me if you ever wanna see it.

38:55.666 --> 38:56.792
Thank you.

38:58.794 --> 39:02.381
It's really nice
to have an actual conversation.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.925
I can't believe
we've been living next door for months.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.511
Joe's seen more of you than I have.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.055
Oh, not really.

39:09.889 --> 39:13.642
I keep telling Matthew, I'd love to have
you both over for a drink sometime.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.937
It's crazy, we haven't had
either of you at the house yet.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.314
We'll do it soon.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.234
Yeah, that sounds great.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.320
Definitely.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.155
[Joe] What is wrong?

39:26.238 --> 39:28.366
I have been doing everything
for this family,

39:28.449 --> 39:30.242
and you've been fucking the neighbor.

39:30.326 --> 39:34.288
-What? Wait, what are you talking about?
-I'm not an idiot, Joe!

39:34.372 --> 39:35.664
I'm not having an--

39:35.748 --> 39:39.210
Look, I don't know what she said,
but I told you the truth.

39:39.293 --> 39:42.421
We had a drink.
She started acting a little crazy. I left.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.841
Then you came home and fucked me
for the first time in six months.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.386
-What is that? A coincidence?
-Fine. I like that she flirted.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.679
Is that what we're doing now?
Policing each other's minds?

39:50.763 --> 39:53.391
-Are we not allowed to have a fantasy?
-Don't give me that.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.519
There's nothing simple about it
when somebody gets stuck in your mind.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.687
-I don't care if you fucked her.
-Sounds like you care.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.022
Are you obsessed with her?

40:01.816 --> 40:03.317
-It's not like that.
-Really?

40:03.401 --> 40:05.111
-Yeah.
-You sure?

40:05.194 --> 40:08.656
I'm sure. Because it was like that
with you, Love! I married you.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.409
The man I fell in love with would do
anything for the ones he loves.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.744
I still would. I moved here.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.123
We're in this fake, plastic suburban hell.

40:17.206 --> 40:21.544
-We moved here for the baby.
-He was supposed to be a girl.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.755
What does that fucking matter?

40:24.839 --> 40:27.383
I don't even-- I-- I don't-- It doesn't.

40:27.466 --> 40:30.136
It feels so emblematic
of getting it wrong,

40:30.219 --> 40:33.514
of feeling like I am gonna
fuck him up. Like he knows.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.599
He looks at me like I'm a monster.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.352
How do you think I feel?

40:39.019 --> 40:42.731
You remember what Forty said.
Five seconds before he died.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.445
That I'd be crazy if I ever thought
I could be a good mother.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.656
Well, he was out of his mind.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.577
Maybe he wasn't.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.166
We...

41:02.126 --> 41:02.960
both...

41:04.462 --> 41:05.838
have done bad things.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.634
I wanted to move here so that...

41:11.886 --> 41:13.137
we could start new...

41:14.013 --> 41:17.808
be safe and never have
to do anything bad ever again.

41:19.226 --> 41:20.519
We get to choose.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.605
We get to choose. We are safe now.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.106
We're together.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.108
I promise, no more.

41:27.234 --> 41:30.946
No more bad things ever again, okay?

41:32.281 --> 41:34.658
While we're telling the truth,

41:34.742 --> 41:37.119
you are a great mother.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.580
Thanks.

41:45.002 --> 41:48.297
Does that mean
I can stop reading Sherry's shitty blog?

41:54.136 --> 41:56.263
There's still time to bond with him.

41:57.848 --> 42:01.477
Try reading him something
other than Fitzgerald. He is a baby.

42:04.438 --> 42:05.981
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

42:10.819 --> 42:11.904
Should we go home?

42:12.988 --> 42:14.323
Yeah, let's go home.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.001
-[Henry crying]
-[humming]

42:27.586 --> 42:29.547
-Hey, are we okay?
-Hey.

42:29.630 --> 42:31.507
-He's been great all night.
-Okay.

42:31.590 --> 42:34.927
Go get some rest. I got him.
Really. I got him. I got him.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.637
-Thank you, thank you.
-Good night.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.347
-Thank you, thank you.
-I love you, Forty.

42:38.430 --> 42:39.431
Oh.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.517
You're okay, Henry.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.438
"Happily ever after" looks
a lot different than I thought.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.488
And a family, the reality of one,

42:54.572 --> 42:56.240
might not be for everyone...

42:57.992 --> 43:00.494
but it's all I've ever wanted.

43:01.662 --> 43:04.832
So I'm gonna make this work.
No matter what it takes.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.171
Goodbye, you.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.055
[upbeat music playing]

43:24.768 --> 43:27.271
[man] Nineteen bucks? It's crazy.
I'll give you 2 bucks.

43:27.354 --> 43:31.275
This isn't a pawnshop, sir.
We don't negotiate late fees.

43:31.358 --> 43:34.153
Manager. I wanna speak to a manager.

43:55.924 --> 43:56.759
[sighs]

43:58.969 --> 44:00.346
Hi, Natalie.

44:02.097 --> 44:02.931
Yep.

44:03.766 --> 44:07.770
Yeah, I wanted to see that place
you were talking about for a bakery.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.316
Amazing.

44:13.150 --> 44:17.738
"But he could not think
of a story to tell Frog.

44:18.572 --> 44:19.448
Then...

44:19.531 --> 44:20.532
Uh...

44:21.283 --> 44:24.703
Toad poured a glass of water
over his head."

44:28.957 --> 44:31.960
Am I the asshole here?
I'm sorry. That's a bad word.

44:33.587 --> 44:34.588
Is it me?

44:37.341 --> 44:38.550
I'm trying.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.346
I'm in over my head.

44:43.055 --> 44:45.933
He said, using an idiom
his son will never understand

44:46.016 --> 44:48.435
because it's impossible
to communicate with babies.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.395
[coos]

44:50.396 --> 44:51.897
Yeah, right. Exactly.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.232
[babbling]

45:01.198 --> 45:03.325
How are we supposed
to understand each other?

45:05.077 --> 45:07.162
How am I supposed to do this right?

45:09.164 --> 45:11.125
I wanna do this right, Forty--

45:11.208 --> 45:12.835
Henry. Henry.

45:12.918 --> 45:13.919
Henry, you see?

45:14.920 --> 45:16.755
You're getting into my head.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.970
I'm gonna do everything I can.

45:26.473 --> 45:29.101
I just don't know what that means yet.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.561
I...

45:32.688 --> 45:33.939
[laughing]

45:41.822 --> 45:43.782
So wait, you don't hate me?

45:43.866 --> 45:45.159
[babbles]

45:49.747 --> 45:51.749
Yeah, same here.

45:52.624 --> 45:53.625
Same here.

45:54.209 --> 45:55.919
Okay. Yeah, it's a good talk.

45:56.670 --> 45:57.546
[clearing throat]

45:57.629 --> 45:59.131
Yeah, let's keep reading.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.049
Uh...

46:01.633 --> 46:04.136
"'Why are you pouring water
over your head?' asked Frog.

46:05.596 --> 46:10.309
'I hope that if I pour water over my head,
it will help me to think of a story.'"

46:18.358 --> 46:19.610
It's cute, right?

46:19.693 --> 46:22.154
Build-out's already mostly done for you.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.952
And the tenant left all the appliances?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.121
Kind of had to.

46:31.872 --> 46:33.290
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

46:33.373 --> 46:36.043
This town isn't exactly
the easiest market.

46:36.126 --> 46:38.086
Your stuff has to be good.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.548
-That, I'm not worried about.
-Then nothing to worry about.

46:42.382 --> 46:44.718
Except landlord has another offer.

46:45.969 --> 46:51.016
But he loves me, so sign
a 3-year lease today and you're golden.

46:52.726 --> 46:55.062
I already sent you papers to e-sign.

46:58.690 --> 47:02.069
-Can I--? Can I see downstairs?
-Yeah, let's go.

47:31.974 --> 47:34.268
Okay, so I know how it looks,

47:34.351 --> 47:37.145
but I was told this is
the best walk-in freezer on the market.

47:39.022 --> 47:40.816
Let me show you the other storage room.

47:55.622 --> 47:56.915
Permits are easy.

47:56.999 --> 48:00.085
So you can have
this place up and running crazy fast.

48:13.724 --> 48:14.892
[moaning]

48:14.975 --> 48:16.226
[dramatic music playing]

48:43.712 --> 48:47.883
Bottom line, in the right hands,
this place could be a raging success.

48:47.966 --> 48:50.469
So, what do you think? [gasps]

48:54.932 --> 48:56.642
This is just the beginning, Henry.

48:56.725 --> 48:59.645
Frog and Toad are great. But wait
until you meet Pippi Longstocking.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.271
-[cell phone buzzing]
-You'll freak out.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.148
I'm just leaving the library. What's up?

49:03.231 --> 49:04.650
[Love sobbing]

49:06.944 --> 49:08.946
Hey, Love. You okay?

49:09.947 --> 49:12.491
Um, Joe.

49:13.742 --> 49:14.868
What's wrong?

49:15.369 --> 49:17.412
I think we need to go to couples' therapy.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.555
