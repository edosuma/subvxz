about those casings,

10:01.535 --> 10:04.369

in my hands.

working that case.

for our sources?

Hickman said

10:31.064 --> 10:35.000

our conversations by hand.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.437
He may have come up with
some wrong answers, Captain,

Sherry, how much did Mark
share with you

19:37.443 --> 19:41.045
about his investigation into
the murder of Officer Reese?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.413
Not as much
as you might think.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.082
Provenza: Well, Mark was working
long hours,

for days on end,

19:48.588 --> 19:51.422
<i> Maybe you got curious</i>
<i> about what he was up to.</i>

19:51.424 --> 19:54.625
Sherry Hickman was a great
detective on our fraud division.
Tao:<i> Maybe you wanted</i>
<i> to look into his hours.</i>

19:54.627 --> 19:57.295
You really think she could have
murdered any of these people?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.430
Our killer is familiar
with how the police work,

20:00.867 --> 20:04.302

<i> Is this your roundabout way</i>
<i> of asking me how I found out</i>

that Mark was in love
with Rachel Gray?

20:07.941 --> 20:09.574
Oh, Sherry, Sherry,

20:13.012 --> 20:14.545
your answer to that question

20:14.547 --> 20:17.348
is very important
to our solving these cases.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.516
So, yes.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.885
Yes, we were wondering

20:20.887 --> 20:23.521
what gave Mark
and Rachel away?

about it from his partner,

21:35.728 --> 21:39.430

22:16.436 --> 22:19.103
It turns out that I didn't
need his password

after Officer Reese was murdered
12 years ago.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.659

can't find the Uzi

28:15.661 --> 28:17.394
where Emile said it was,

28:17.396 --> 28:18.796

28:18.798 --> 28:21.732
that her boyfriend's deal
is not gonna make.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.368
Or maybe she's afraid
that he'll snitch on her

28:24.370 --> 28:26.570
like he did
with Daniel Price.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.773
So she tells a detective
where our murder weapon is,

28:29.775 --> 28:31.742
and the gun is<i> almost</i> turned in.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.510
Tao: And we know that's
a consideration

28:33.512 --> 28:36.013
because the serial number
of the Uzi was run,

28:36.015 --> 28:39.049
but the gun was held back
'cause there was a problem.

it pushes his wife into
confronting her publicly.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.760

why Sherry would blow up.

28:49.762 --> 28:53.697
It's tough finding out your
spouse is lying to you, sir.

28:53.699 --> 28:57.668
Provenza: Rachel tells Sherry,
"It's over. I've moved on."

28:57.670 --> 29:00.370
But Mark Hickman
<i> hasn't</i> moved on.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.510
No, Chief,
that's not why guys

29:06.512 --> 29:08.245
follow the women
who break up with them.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.582
Mark Hickman needed to know
who Rachel left him for.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.984

unlike Dennis Price,

29:13.986 --> 29:16.019

a professional shooter.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.755

the dope come in?

29:19.325 --> 29:20.824

That's the problem.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.963
And then there's
the prepaid cell.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.765

records at L.A. Clear,

29:27.767 --> 29:30.567
someone called Emile and Tamika
right before they died.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.636
Probably trying to schedule
their deaths,

29:32.638 --> 29:34.638
but more frustrating still

29:34.640 --> 29:37.107
is<i> where</i> this prepaid cell
was found.

29:37.109 --> 29:41.912
At the church in Goldman's car
during Tamika's funeral.

29:41.914 --> 29:46.717
We thought the now-Reverend
Daniel Price had left it behind.

29:46.719 --> 29:48.552
But in hindsight, it couldn't
have happened that way

29:48.554 --> 29:50.687
because Reverend Price
had nothing to do

29:50.689 --> 29:53.791
with any of the murders
after Officer Reese

29:53.793 --> 29:56.160
and had nothing to do
with the heroin.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.796
And Sherry was nowhere near the
church during the funeral, sir.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.230
Stephanie:
Well, Hickman was,

30:00.232 --> 30:02.833
and he knew dope was flowing
out of the church.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.902
But there's a big problem
with that theory,

30:04.904 --> 30:07.504
though hopefully our witness
will help us sort it out.

30:07.506 --> 30:08.705
Witness?
What witness?

30:08.707 --> 30:10.140

30:10.142 --> 30:12.142
who was standing in the doorway
of his house

30:12.144 --> 30:14.077
during the shooting
of Tamika and her baby.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.480
I filmed him right by
where we found the casings.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.315
He didn't want to talk
at the time.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.217
But we offered
him protection.
