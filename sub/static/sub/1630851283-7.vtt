WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:13.813
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
>> HOW DOES A COUNTRY GO FROM
DEMOCRACY TO DICTATORSHIP IN ONE

00:13.880 --> 00:21.121
GENERATION?
IT'S EASIER THAN YOU MAY
IMAGINE.
THIS IS JUAN SEBASTIAN CHAMORRO,

00:21.187 --> 00:27.560
A GEORGETOWN-EDUCATED ECONOMIST,
WHO WAS PLANNING TO CHALLENGE
THE DICTATOR DANIEL ORTEGA FOR
PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA.

00:27.627 --> 00:34.267
>><i> SI ESTAN VIENDO ESTE VIDEO,</i>
<i>ES PORQUE HE SIDO...</i>
>> THIS VIDEO WAS RECORDED JUST
HOURS BEFORE HE WAS VIOLENTLY

00:34.334 --> 00:41.074
TAKEN FROM HIS HOME BY MASKED
POLICE OFFICERS.
IN IT, HE SAYS "IF YOU'RE SEEING
THIS, I'VE BEEN CAPTURED."

00:41.141 --> 00:41.875
(<i> TICKING</i> )

00:44.511 --> 00:49.883
>> THIS WE'RE SAVING.
I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE...
>> WE AMERICANS SPEND 90% OF OUR
TIME INSIDE BUILDINGS.

00:49.949 --> 00:57.590
WELL, WE FOUND A GROUP OF YOUNG
ARCHITECTS WHO HAVE SET OUT TO
CREATE A NEW MODEL OF
ARCHITECTURE, ONE THAT IS BOTH

00:57.657 --> 01:03.797
BEAUTIFUL AND HEALTHY FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO BUILD AND USE THEM--
INSPIRATION THEY SAY THEY GOT IN
AFRICA AND HAVE NOW BROUGHT

01:03.863 --> 01:13.206
HOME.
WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN RWANDA,
YOU WERE ALSO DOING IN HAITI,
MALAWI, AND POUGHKEEPSIE?

01:13.273 --> 01:15.642
>> (<i> LAUGHS</i> )
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:17.877 --> 01:23.650
>> YUVAL NOAH HARARI IS A WORLD-
RENOWNED HISTORIAN WHO HAS
LOOKED INTO THE FUTURE AND IS
MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED

01:23.716 --> 01:33.460
ABOUT WHAT HE SEES.
>> WE WILL SOON HAVE THE POWER
TO RE-ENGINEER OUR BODIES AND
BRAINS-- WHETHER IT IS WITH

01:33.526 --> 01:41.801
GENETIC ENGINEERING OR BY
DIRECTLY CONNECTING BRAINS TO
COMPUTERS, OR BY CREATING
COMPLETELY NON-ORGANIC ENTITIES,

01:41.868 --> 01:46.172
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
AND THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE
DEVELOPING AT BREAKNECK SPEED.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:49.142 --> 01:53.780
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
>> I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.

01:53.847 --> 01:59.719
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."

01:59.786 --> 02:06.459
(<i> TICKING</i> )

02:08.695 --> 02:16.636
>> Sharyn Alfonsi: NEXT WEEK, A
COUNTRY WITH A LONG, COMPLICATED
HISTORY WITH THE U.S. WILL HOLD
ITS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

02:16.703 --> 02:22.041
ITS PRESIDENT IS SEEKING A
FOURTH CONSECUTIVE TERM, AND HAS
MADE SURE NOTHING STANDS IN HIS
WAY.

02:22.108 --> 02:28.615
HE'S CHANGED THE COUNTRY'S LAWS,
SILENCED THE MEDIA, AND LOCKED
UP CANDIDATES WHO PLANNED TO RUN
AGAINST HIM.

02:28.681 --> 02:36.155
NICARAGUA'S DANIEL ORTEGA IS NOT
THE FATIGUE-WEARING
REVOLUTIONARY THAT YOU MAY
REMEMBER.

02:36.222 --> 02:42.395
HE'S NOW 75, AND RARELY SEEN.
STILL, MANY NICARAGUANS FEAR HE
IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE'S EVER
BEEN.

02:42.462 --> 02:48.401
AND TONIGHT, YOU WILL HEAR FROM
TWO WOMEN WHOSE HUSBANDS WERE
PLANNING TO CHALLENGE ORTEGA FOR
THE PRESIDENCY.

02:48.468 --> 02:56.242
BOTH MEN WERE ARRESTED BY THE
REGIME IN JUNE, AND THEIR WIVES
HAVEN'T SEEN OR SPOKEN TO THEM
SINCE.

02:56.309 --> 03:01.080
NOW, THE WOMEN ARE FIGHTING TO
BRING BACK THEIR HUSBANDS, AND A
DEMOCRACY LOST.
>> Juan Sebastian Chamorro:

03:01.147 --> 03:08.755
<i>SI, ESTAN VIENDO ESTE VIDEO, ES</i>
<i>PORQUE HE SIDO...</i>
>> Alfonsi: "IF YOU'RE SEEING
THIS, I'VE BEEN CAPTURED."

03:08.821 --> 03:12.959
THOSE WERE THE CHILLING WORDS OF
JUAN SEBASTIAN CHAMORRO, HOURS
BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN FROM HIS
HOME BY MASKED POLICE OFFICERS

03:13.026 --> 03:18.798
IN JUNE.
>> Victoria Cardenas: EIGHT
POLICE PATROLS WERE COMING.
THERE WAS A LOT OF CARS, A LOT

03:18.865 --> 03:27.340
OF NOISE, A LOT OF PEOPLE
JUMPING IN OUR WALL.
>> Alfonsi: VICTORIA CARDENAS IS
JUAN SEBASTIAN CHAMORRO'S WIFE.

03:27.407 --> 03:32.612
CHAMORRO WAS PLANNING TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT AGAINST DANIEL ORTEGA,
AND WAS CONSIDERED A LEADING
CANDIDATE.

03:32.679 --> 03:36.716
>> Chamorro:<i> POLICIA ORTEGUISTA.</i>
>> Alfonsi: BECAUSE OF THAT,
CARDENAS SAYS, POLICE HAD BEEN
HARASSING HIM OUTSIDE OF THEIR

03:36.783 --> 03:44.624
HOME FOR MONTHS.
BUT ON JUNE 8, THEY CAME IN.
>> Cardenas: HE WAS ON THE FLOOR
WITH HIS HANDS UP, SAYING, "I AM

03:44.691 --> 03:51.965
HERE, PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING
TO MY WIFE."
WE ARE UNARMED.
AND THEY JUMPED THE WALLS.

03:52.031 --> 04:00.406
THEY BROKE IN, AND THEY TOOK HIM
VIOLENTLY.
>> Alfonsi: CARDENAS HASN'T SEEN
OR SPOKEN TO HIM SINCE.

04:00.473 --> 04:08.615
JUAN SEBASTIAN CHAMORRO, A
GEORGETOWN-EDUCATED ECONOMIST,
IS PART OF A PROMINENT POLITICAL
FAMILY IN NICARAGUA.

04:08.681 --> 04:16.623
DAYS EARLIER, HIS COUSIN,
CRISTIANA CHAMORRO-- WHO,
COINCIDENTALLY, WAS ALSO RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT-- WAS ABOUT TO

04:16.689 --> 04:24.397
HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE OUTSIDE
HER HOME, WHEN POLICE IN RIOT
GEAR SHOWED UP.
YOU CAN SEE POLICE PUSH THE

04:24.464 --> 04:30.370
CROWD BACK.
CHAMORRO WAS PLACED UNDER HOUSE
ARREST.
OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS,

04:30.436 --> 04:38.311
NICARAGUA'S POLICE FORCE
DETAINED DOZENS OF CRITICS OF
THE REGIME, JOURNALISTS, AND,
ULTIMATELY, SEVEN OF THE LEADING

04:38.378 --> 04:43.850
CANDIDATES WHO PLANNED TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENT AGAINST ORTEGA.
>> Jose Miguel Vivanco: NOBODY
REALLY SEE HIM.

04:43.916 --> 04:51.357
>> Alfonsi: JOSE MIGUEL VIVANCO
IS A DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS
WATCH, A NON-PROFIT ADVOCACY
GROUP THAT'S BEEN REPORTING FROM

04:51.424 --> 04:56.162
INSIDE NICARAGUA FOR DECADES.
A LOT OF DICTATORS WILL AT LEAST
GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF
PRETENDING THERE'S A LEGITIMATE

04:56.229 --> 05:06.406
ELECTION.
HE'S NOT.
>> Vivanco: ORTEGA'S DELIBERATE
AND FLAGRANT CRACK-DOWN AGAINST

05:06.472 --> 05:16.416
PEACEFUL OPPOSITION LEADERS IS
SOMETHING WITHOUT ANY PRECEDENT
IN LATIN AMERICA SINCE THE '70s
AND '80s, WHEN MOST OF THE

05:16.482 --> 05:24.424
REGION WAS UNDER MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.
>> Alfonsi: WHAT MAKES IT
UNPRECEDENTED?

05:24.490 --> 05:32.632
>> Vivanco: SINCE ORTEGA
CONTROLS CONGRESS, HE MANAGED TO
PASS LEGISLATION AT THE END OF
LAST YEAR THAT SANCTIONED AS

05:32.699 --> 05:39.839
TREASON ESSENTIALLY ANY
CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT.
>> Alfonsi: SO, IF YOU CRITICIZE
THE GOVERNMENT, YOU CAN BE

05:39.906 --> 05:45.912
THROWN IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.
>> Vivanco: THE LANGUAGE THAT
THEY USE IS "ANY DAMAGE TO THE
SUPERIOR INTERESTS OF THE

05:45.978 --> 05:51.718
NATION."
>> Alfonsi: IT SOUNDS ORWELLIAN.
>> Vivanco: ORWELLIAN.
IT'S COMPLETELY ORWELLIAN.

05:51.784 --> 05:58.725
>> Alfonsi: IN JUNE, SECRETARY
OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN CALLED
FOR PRESIDENT ORTEGA TO
IMMEDIATELY RELEASE THE

05:58.791 --> 06:04.163
CANDIDATES, AND ANNOUNCED
SANCTIONS AGAINST MEMBERS OF
ORTEGA'S FAMILY AND INNER
CIRCLE.

06:04.230 --> 06:08.935
UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO, IT MIGHT
HAVE LOOKED LIKE DANIEL ORTEGA
HAD MELLOWED OUT WITH AGE...
>> Ortega:<i> CREAR LA CONDICIONES.</i>

06:09.001 --> 06:16.609
>> Alfonsi: ...A FAR CRY FROM
THE REVOLUTIONARY PRESIDENT
CARTER INVITED TO THE WHITE
HOUSE IN 1979.

06:16.676 --> 06:24.417
ORTEGA'S SANDANISTA GUERILLAS
WERE CREDITED WITH BRINGING DOWN
THE SOMOZA FAMILY DICTATORSHIP
IN NICARAGUA.

06:24.484 --> 06:30.089
LATER, THEY FOUGHT OFF THE
U.S.-SPONSORED CONTRAS.
IN 1984, DANIEL ORTEGA WAS
ELECTED PRESIDENT.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.159
AND LATER...
>> Ortega:<i> LA REVOLUCION</i>
<i>NICARAGUÃœENSE.</i>
>> Alfonsi: ...SAT DOWN WITH OUR

06:33.226 --> 06:40.633
MIKE WALLACE.
>> Ortega:<i> MUY GENEROSO.</i>
>> Alfonsi: ORTEGA WAS VOTED OUT
OF OFFICE IN 1990, BUT RETURNED

06:40.700 --> 06:51.577
TO POWER IN 2006, PROMISING TO
FIGHT CORRUPTION.
INSTEAD, HE TIGHTENED HIS GRIP
ON THE COUNTRY-- FIRST, CHANGING

06:51.644 --> 06:59.152
THE CONSTITUTION SO HE COULD
SERVE MORE TERMS, THEN MAKING
HIS WIFE, ROSARIO MURILLO, AN
ECCENTRIC, NEW-AGE POET, HIS

06:59.218 --> 07:04.924
VICE PRESIDENT.
THEIR CHILDREN ALSO HOLD KEY
POSITIONS IN NICARAGUA.
EIGHT OF THE COUPLE'S NINE

07:04.991 --> 07:12.398
CHILDREN WERE MADE PRESIDENTIAL
ADVISORS.
THEY OVERSEE A LUCRATIVE OIL
DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS, AND MOST

07:12.465 --> 07:20.173
OF THE COUNTRY'S TV CHANNELS.
BUT EVEN AS THE ORTEGA FAMILY'S
WEALTH HAS EXPLODED, NICARAGUA
REMAINS THE SECOND-POOREST

07:20.239 --> 07:28.614
COUNTRY IN THE WESTERN
HEMISPHERE.
(<i> HORNS BLOWING</i> )
IN 2018, NICARAGUANS REVOLTED.

07:28.681 --> 07:36.422
THOUSANDS TOOK TO THE STREETS TO
PROTEST ORTEGA'S PROPOSED CUTS
TO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR SENIOR
CITIZENS.

07:36.489 --> 07:42.395
SOON, PROTESTORS WERE CALLING
FOR ORTEGA AND HIS WIFE TO STEP
DOWN.
JOSE MIGUEL VIVANCO SAYS IT WAS

07:42.461 --> 07:48.401
A TURNING POINT FOR THE COUNTRY.
>> Vivanco: THAT
DEMONSTRATION...
>><i> VANDO, VANDO!</i>

07:48.467 --> 07:54.407
(<i> SHOTS FIRED</i> )
>> Vivanco: ...WAS CONFRONTED
WITH BRUTAL FORCE BY ORTEGA.
(<i> GUNFIRE</i> )

07:54.473 --> 08:02.782
>> Alfonsi: THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
WERE INJURED, MORE THAN 700 WERE
ARRESTED, AND AT LEAST 350
PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY POLICE OR

08:02.849 --> 08:12.391
PARAMILITARY GROUPS SUPPORTED BY
THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT.
>> Vivanco: ALL OF THOSE CRIMES,
ALL OF THOSE ATROCITIES

08:12.458 --> 08:17.363
COMMITTED BY ORTEGA AND HIS
SECURITY FORCES JUST A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO, HE WAS ABLE TO GET
AWAY WITH THOSE CRIMES.

08:17.430 --> 08:27.573
>> Alfonsi: BUT VIVANCO SAYS
ORTEGA ALSO REALIZED THAT IF HE
LOST POWER, HE MIGHT BE
IMPRISONED FOR WHAT NICARAGUAN

08:27.640 --> 08:31.577
JOURNALISTS CALLED A "MASSACRE"
OF PROTESTORS.
>> Felix Maradiaga: VERY FEW
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD DOUBT

08:31.644 --> 08:37.783
THAT NICARAGUA IS A
DICTATORSHIP.
>> Alfonsi: FELIX MARADIAGA, A
FORMER CABINET MEMBER, WAS ONE

08:37.850 --> 08:44.624
OF ORTEGA'S MOST OUTSPOKEN
CRITICS.
A GRADUATE OF HARVARD, HE
ADDRESSED WORLD LEADERS AT THE

08:44.690 --> 08:51.864
GENEVA SUMMIT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
AND DEMOCRACY IN 2019.
>> Maradiaga: I COME HERE WITH
THE CONVICTION AND HOPE THAT THE

08:51.931 --> 08:59.605
WORLD WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT
THE STRUGGLE OF MY PEOPLE TO
BUILD A FREE AND OPEN SOCIETY.
>> Alfonsi: FELIX MARADIAGA WAS

08:59.672 --> 09:05.211
TEACHING NON-VIOLENT ACTIVISM TO
NICARAGUAN STUDENTS...
(<i> SHOUTING</i> )
...WHEN WITNESSES SAY HE WAS

09:05.278 --> 09:12.652
BEATEN BY ORTEGA'S HENCHMEN IN
2018.
(<i> LOUD CHANTING</i> )
AFTER THIS ATTACK, MARADIAGA WAS

09:12.718 --> 09:20.626
HOSPITALIZED.
FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS, HE WAS
UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE BY
THE POLICE, ACCORDING TO HIS

09:20.693 --> 09:27.667
WIFE, BERTA VALLE.
>> Berta Valle: THEY WATCH HIM.
THEY PUT PATROLS IN FRONT OF HIS
HOUSE.

09:27.733 --> 09:32.638
THE POLICE WOULD TELL HIM THAT
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GO OUT OF THE
HOUSE.
>><i> NO, NO PERMITA.</i>

09:32.705 --> 09:40.746
>> Valle: AND FROM DECEMBER 2020
TO FEBRUARY '21, HE WAS UNDER
HOUSE ARREST.
>> Alfonsi: SO, NO WARRANT, BUT

09:40.813 --> 09:45.251
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE
HOUSE?
>> Valle: EXACTLY.
>> Alfonsi: EVEN SO, FELIX

09:45.318 --> 09:53.225
MARADIAGA DECIDED HE WOULD RUN
FOR PRESIDENT, ONE OF A GROUP OF
OPPOSITION CANDIDATES WHO, FOR
THE FIRST TIME, HAD DECIDED TO

09:53.292 --> 10:00.399
BAND TOGETHER TO TRY TO DEFEAT
DANIEL ORTEGA.
>> Valle: THEY SIGNED A DOCUMENT
SAYING THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO

10:00.466 --> 10:08.641
SUPPORT THE ONE THAT COULD
REPRESENT THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.
>> Alfonsi: BUT THE OPPOSITION
NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO PUT

10:08.708 --> 10:16.615
THEIR CANDIDATE FORWARD.
MOST WERE ARRESTED OR FLED THE
COUNTRY BEFORE THEY COULD FILE
THE PAPERWORK TO OFFICIALLY PUT

10:16.682 --> 10:22.088
THEM ON THE BALLOT.
ON JUNE 8, FELIX MARADIAGA WAS
SUMMONED TO MEET WITH GOVERNMENT
PROSECUTORS.

10:22.154 --> 10:28.627
HIS FAMILY FEARED HE WOULD BE
ARRESTED DURING THE MEETING.
>> Valle: SO, HE WENT WITH A
LAWYER, A FRIEND, AND HE WAS

10:28.694 --> 10:32.631
INTERVIEWED FOR FOUR HOURS.
>> Alfonsi: SO, FELIX CAME OUT.
HE TALKED TO THE INDEPENDENT
PRESS.

10:32.698 --> 10:37.136
>> Valle: EXACTLY.
>> Maradiaga:<i> NO TENEMOS MIEDO,</i>
<i>NO TENEMOS MIEDO.</i>
>> Valle: WE WERE WATCHING THIS

10:37.203 --> 10:42.408
LIVE, AND WE SAID, "OH, THANKS,
GOD.
HE CAME OUT, HE'S OKAY, HE'S
GOING TO TAKE THE CAR, AND HE'S

10:42.475 --> 10:48.914
GOING TO LEAVE."
>> Alfonsi: HIS ATTORNEY SAYS
THEY WERE DRIVING AWAY WHEN
MARADIAGA WAS DRAGGED OUT OF THE

10:48.981 --> 10:55.087
CAR AND BEATEN BY POLICE.
HIS WIFE HASN'T SEEN HIM SINCE
THAT MORNING IN JUNE.
>> Maradiaga:<i> FELIZ CUMPLEANOS,</i>

10:55.154 --> 11:04.630
<i>MI AMOR.</i>
>> Alfonsi: IT TURNS OUT,
MARADIAGA KNEW HE WAS IN DANGER.
HOURS BEFORE HIS ARREST, HE LEFT

11:04.697 --> 11:09.068
HIS DAUGHTER, ALEJANDRA, A
SERIES OF VIDEOS SO SHE WOULD
HEAR HIS VOICE IN CASE HE WASN'T
THERE FOR HER EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.

11:09.135 --> 11:14.807
>> Maradiaga:<i> ESTA PENSANDO</i>
<i>ENVOS HOY DIA TE CUPLEANOS.</i>
>> Alfonsi: "I'M THINKING OF YOU
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY," HE SAYS, AND

11:14.874 --> 11:20.946
TELLS HER, "I LOVE YOU."
>> Maradiaga:<i> TE AMO.</i>
>> Alfonsi: SHE AND HER MOTHER
HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE UNITED

11:21.013 --> 11:27.653
STATES FOR THREE YEARS BECAUSE
OF THREATS AT HOME, AND ARE NOW
APPLYING FOR ASYLUM.
WE CONCEALED ALEJANDRA'S

11:27.720 --> 11:34.493
IDENTITY FOR HER SAFETY.
>> Alejandra: I WANT TO GO SEE
MY DOG, MY FAMILY.
I HAVE A CAT AND A DOG.

11:34.560 --> 11:40.633
>> Alfonsi: IN AUGUST, WE MET
BERTA VALLE AND VICTORIA
CARDENAS IN WASHINGTON, WHERE
THEY'D BEEN PETITIONING U.S.

11:40.699 --> 11:45.604
LAWMAKERS TO HELP FREE THEIR
HUSBANDS AND ABOUT 150 OTHER
POLITICAL PRISONERS IN
NICARAGUA.

11:45.671 --> 11:51.944
>> Valle: AND WE'RE DEMANDING
JUSTICE...
>> Alfonsi: AT THAT POINT, THE
MEN HAD DISAPPEARED.

11:52.011 --> 11:56.615
NO ONE HAD HEARD FROM THEM OR
SEEN THEM IN TWO MONTHS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL
ALIVE?

11:56.682 --> 12:04.156
>> Valle: THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO-
- TO BELIEVE, YOU KNOW?
WE-- WE HAVE THE HOPE THAT--
THAT HE IS OKAY, BUT WE DON'T

12:04.223 --> 12:12.398
KNOW.
AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR
A PROOF OF LIFE TO THIS POINT.
AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE DOING ALL

12:12.465 --> 12:23.943
THIS EFFORT TO COME OUT AND TO--
TO GO TO THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO IN NICARAGUA.

12:24.009 --> 12:30.416
>> Alfonsi: LAST MONTH, 87 DAYS
AFTER THEIR ARRESTS, ATTORNEYS
FOR FELIX MARADIAGA AND JUAN
SEBASTIAN CHAMORRO WERE ALLOWED

12:30.483 --> 12:39.925
TO BRIEFLY SEE THEM AT EL
CHIPOTE, THE NICARAGUAN PRISON
THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED BY HUMAN
RIGHTS WORKERS AS "A DUNGEON."

12:39.992 --> 12:47.133
BOTH MEN WERE CHARGED WITH
"CONSPIRACY TO UNDERMINE THE
NATIONAL INTEGRITY" AT A CLOSED
HEARING IN THE JAIL.

12:47.199 --> 12:54.406
ATTORNEYS SAY BOTH CHAMORRO AND
MARADIAGA HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT
WEIGHT AND BEEN SUBJECTED TO
MONTHS OF INTERROGATIONS AND

12:54.473 --> 13:01.113
PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE.
>> Cardenas: IT'S A VIOLATION OF
THE BASIC UMAN RIGHTS.
IT'S NOT ONLY MY FAMILY WHO IS

13:01.180 --> 13:12.658
SUFFERING; IT'S MORE THAN 140
FAMILIES WHO HAVE POLITICAL
PRISONERS WHO ARE INNOCENT AND
ARE LIVING THIS AWFUL SITUATION.

13:12.725 --> 13:24.236
>> Alfonsi: VICTORIA CARDENAS
AND BERTA VALLE CANNOT GO BACK
TO NICARAGUA BECAUSE OF THEIR
APPEALS FOR HELP TO WASHINGTON

13:24.303 --> 13:28.641
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
THE WOMEN HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN
ABSENTIA WITH BEING "TRAITORS TO
THE HOMELAND."

13:28.707 --> 13:35.548
SO, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU
WENT BACK TO NICARAGUA NOW?
WOULD YOU BE ARRESTED?
>> Valle: DEFINITELY, YES.

13:35.614 --> 13:42.421
NOT ONLY ARRESTED, BUT, IF THEY
CONDEMN ME, THAT WOULD BE LIFE--
LIFE PRISON.
>> Alfonsi: THE VIOLENCE IN

13:42.488 --> 13:52.665
NICARAGUA IS FUELING AN EXODUS.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NICARAGUANS
HAVE FLED TO COSTA RICA, AND
U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER

13:52.731 --> 14:00.172
PROTECTION SAYS ABOUT 38,000
NICARAGUANS HAVE REACHED THE
U.S. BORDER SINCE JUNE COMPARED
TO LESS THAN 800 PEOPLE OVER THE

14:00.239 --> 14:06.412
SAME TIME LAST YEAR.
IN AUGUST, THE STATE DEPARTMENT
ANNOUNCED MORE SANCTIONS AGAINST
MEMBERS OF THE ORTEGA REGIME.

14:06.478 --> 14:14.486
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
APPROVED SENDING MORE THAN
$350 MILLION TO NICARAGUA THAT'S

14:14.553 --> 14:18.424
SUPPOSED TO HELP FIGHT HUNGER
AND COVID.
>> Elvira Salazar: WHAT DO YOU
THINK THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE

14:18.490 --> 14:23.696
THAT MONEY TO?
JUST TO PUT THESE PEOPLE IN JAIL
AND TORTURE THEM EVEN MORE?
>> Alfonsi: LAST MONTH, MEMBERS

14:23.762 --> 14:27.533
OF CONGRESS FROM BOTH PARTIES
DEMANDED THE I.M.F. RECONSIDER
SENDING MORE MONEY TO
NICARAGUA...

14:27.600 --> 14:32.638
>> Albio Sires: THIS IS JUST NOT
ACCEPTABLE.
>> Alfonsi: ...AND CALLED FOR
STRONGER SANCTIONS AGAINST

14:32.705 --> 14:39.678
ORTEGA.
THE PENTAGON HAS ALSO WARNED
CONGRESS THAT RUSSIA HAS BEEN
SUPPLYING NICARAGUA WITH

14:39.745 --> 14:47.853
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MILITARY
EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING, AND THAT
ORTEGA HAS ALLOWED RUSSIA TO
BUILD A LISTENING STATION SO

14:47.920 --> 14:52.658
CLOSE TO THE U.S.
HAVEN'T WE HEARD THIS STORY
BEFORE?
THIS ALL SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR.

14:52.725 --> 14:57.162
>> Vivanco: IT-- IT IS, GOING
BACK 35 YEARS TO THE-- TO THE
MIDDLE OF THE COLD WAR.
THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE

14:57.229 --> 15:04.637
SCENARIO WE ARE OPERATING, WE'RE
LIVING NOW.
>> Alfonsi: JOSE MIGUEL VIVANCO
SAYS, WITH RUSSIA'S CONTINUED

15:04.703 --> 15:12.411
MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT,
U.S. SANCTIONS WILL NOT BE
ENOUGH TO CONVINCE DANIEL ORTEGA
TO CHANGE COURSE.

15:12.478 --> 15:16.682
>> Vivanco: ORTEGA HAS DECIDED
TO STAY IN POWER FOR THE REST OF
HIS LIFE.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:24.723 --> 15:30.863
>> Lesley Stahl: WE AMERICANS
SPEND 90% OF OUR TIME INSIDE OF
BUILDINGS, YET MOST OF US GIVE
LITTLE THOUGHT TO THE ROLE

15:30.929 --> 15:38.871
ARCHITECTURE PLAYS IN OUR LIVES
AND OUR HEALTH.
TONIGHT, WE BRING YOU A STORY
ABOUT A GROUP OF AWARD-WINNING

15:38.937 --> 15:46.912
YOUNG ARCHITECTS WHO HAVE SET
OUT TO CREATE A NEW MODEL OF
ARCHITECTURE-- NOT A PARTICULAR
STYLE OF BUILDING, BUT A WAY OF

15:46.979 --> 15:54.787
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BUILD, WHO
SHOULD BUILD, USING WHAT, AND
FOR WHOM.
THEIR NON-PROFIT FIRM, BASED IN

15:54.853 --> 16:02.861
BOSTON, IS CALLED MASS, SHORT
FOR "MODEL OF ARCHITECTURE
SERVING SOCIETY."
AND, THOUGH THEY TRAINED AT

16:02.928 --> 16:12.671
HARVARD, THEY SAY THEY LEARNED
THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS OF
ARCHITECTURE DURING THEIR TIME
SPENT IN, OF ALL PLACES, RWANDA.

16:12.738 --> 16:22.881
RWANDA IS A COUNTRY MANY PEOPLE
KNOW FOR ONE THING: THE 1994
GENOCIDE THAT KILLED MORE THAN
800,000 PEOPLE.

16:22.948 --> 16:33.625
TODAY, RWANDA IS AT PEACE, A
BUSTLING NATION OF 13 MILLION,
WORKING HARD TO LIFT ITS
POPULATION OUT OF POVERTY.

16:33.692 --> 16:44.503
THERE ARE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, SEVERAL
OF THEM BEING DESIGNED BY MASS.
THOUGH STARTED BY AMERICANS, THE

16:44.570 --> 16:50.809
HEAD OF ITS TEAM IN KIGALI TODAY
IS RWANDAN ARCHITECT CHRISTIAN
BENIMANA.
I HEARD THAT WHEN MASS STARTED,

16:50.876 --> 16:54.747
THERE WAS NO WORD FOR
"ARCHITECT" IN YOUR LANGUAGE.
>> Christian Benimana: AND THERE
IS STILL NO WORD FOR

16:54.813 --> 17:00.652
"ARCHITECT."
YOU HAVE AN EXPRESSION:
(<i> SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE</i> )
>> Stahl: MEANING?

17:00.719 --> 17:10.162
>> Benimana: "EXPERT IN THE
CREATION OF BUILDINGS."
>> Stahl: BENIMANA TOLD US HE
DREAMED OF CREATING BUILDINGS

17:10.229 --> 17:18.670
EVEN AS A LITTLE BOY.
BUT, WITH NO SCHOOL OF
ARCHITECTURE IN POST-GENOCIDE
RWANDA, HE HAD TO STUDY IN

17:18.737 --> 17:24.643
CHINA, IN MANDARIN.
MICHAEL MURPHY, MASS' EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR, HAD A VERY DIFFERENT
PATH TO ARCHITECTURE.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.380
>> Michael Murphy: I STUDIED
ENGLISH LITERATURE.
>> Stahl: WELL, THAT'S GOING TO
GET YOU FAR IN ARCHITECTURE.

17:28.447 --> 17:34.887
>> Murphy: YEAH.
(<i> CHUCKLES</i> )
>> Stahl: MURPHY'S LIFE TOOK A
SHARP TURN AFTER COLLEGE, WHEN

17:34.953 --> 17:42.661
HIS FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
CANCER, GIVEN JUST A FEW WEEKS
TO LIVE.
MURPHY RUSHED BACK TO

17:42.728 --> 17:47.166
POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK, TO THEIR
OLD HOME THAT HIS DAD HAD SPENT
WEEKENDS RESTORING.
>> Murphy: I SAID, "WHAT CAN I

17:47.232 --> 17:52.938
DO WHILE I WAIT HERE ON DEATH
WATCH?"
SO, I START WORKING ON THE
HOUSE, AND, AFTER THREE WEEKS,

17:53.005 --> 17:58.243
HE WAS STILL ALIVE.
SIX WEEKS, WE STARTED WORKING
TOGETHER.
AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF-- I'D

17:58.310 --> 18:02.781
FULLY RESTORED THE BUILDING.
HE WAS FULLY IN REMISSION, AND
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, WORKING ON
THIS HOUSE WITH YOU, IT SAVED MY

18:02.848 --> 18:06.685
LIFE.
IT HEALED ME."
>> Stahl: WHOA.
WOW.

18:06.752 --> 18:11.123
>> Murphy: AND THEN I SAID,
"WELL, I HAVE TO BE AN ARCHITECT
NOW."
>> Alan Ricks: AND HE CAME IN

18:11.190 --> 18:16.895
WEARING THESE SILVER COWBOY
BOOTS.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: ALAN RICKS AND MURPHY

18:16.962 --> 18:24.703
BECAME FAST FRIENDS AS
FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS AT HARVARD'S
GRADUATE SCHOOL OF DESIGN.
BUT AS THEY DOVE IN, BOTH FOUND

18:24.770 --> 18:30.709
SOMETHING WANTING IN THE
CURRICULUM.
>> Murphy: WE WERE LEARNING
ABOUT THE HEROISM OF

18:30.776 --> 18:35.547
ARCHITECTURE, THE BEAUTIFUL
SCULPTURES, THE NAMES OF THE
FAMOUS ARCHITECTS.
>> Stahl: BUT NOT SO MUCH ABOUT

18:35.614 --> 18:45.257
HOW ARCHITECTURE COULD HELP
PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES.
DURING FIRST SEMESTER, MURPHY
WENT TO A TALK BY ONE OF HIS

18:45.324 --> 18:50.963
IDOLS, DR. PAUL FARMER, WHO HAD
FOUNDED THE NON-PROFIT PARTNERS
IN HEALTH TO PROVIDE MEDICAL
CARE FOR THE NEEDIEST

18:51.029 --> 18:54.933
POPULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Murphy: HE SAID, "WE'RE
BUILDING HOSPITALS, WE'RE
BUILDING CLINICS, WE'RE BUILDING

18:55.000 --> 19:00.706
SCHOOLS."
AND SO, WHEN I WENT UP TO HIM
AFTERWARDS TO ASK, YOU KNOW,
"WHO ARE THE ARCHITECTS THAT

19:00.772 --> 19:06.245
YOU'RE WORKING WITH?," HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW, ARCHITECTS HAVE NEVER
ASKED US HOW THEY COULD BE OF
SERVICE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING, SO

19:06.311 --> 19:11.550
WE OFTEN HAVE TO DO IT
OURSELVES."
>> Stahl: WHY WEREN'T ARCHITECTS
ATTRACTED TO WORKING WITH YOU?

19:11.617 --> 19:16.421
I MEAN, A LOT OF THEM CARE ABOUT
THE POOR.
>> Dr. Paul Farmer: THEY
CERTAINLY DO.

19:16.488 --> 19:20.926
BUT THE WAY THE INCENTIVE
STRUCTURE IS SET UP IS, "HEY,
YOU GIVE US MONEY, WE'LL DESIGN
SOMETHING FOR YOU."

19:20.993 --> 19:27.933
>> Stahl: SO, WHEN MURPHY
OFFERED TO VOLUNTEER ON A
PARTNERS IN HEALTH PROJECT IN
RWANDA THE FOLLOWING SUMMER OF

19:28.000 --> 19:31.169
2007, DR. FARMER SAID, "BRING IT
ON."
>> Farmer: WE GAVE HIM SOME VERY
HUMBLE PROJECTS.

19:31.236 --> 19:35.374
>> Stahl: YOU'RE SMILING.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
MUST BE PRETTY GOOD.
>> Murphy: HE ASKED ME IF I

19:35.440 --> 19:39.811
WOULD DESIGN A LITTLE LAUNDRY
BUILDING.
>> Stahl: A LAUNDRY BUILDING?
>> Murphy: (<i> LAUGHS</i> )

19:39.878 --> 19:42.848
>> Stahl: WELL, HOW DID THE
LAUNDRY LOOK?
>> Farmer: IT LOOKED PRETTY
GOOD.

19:42.915 --> 19:49.354
IT STILL LOOKS GOOD.
>> Stahl: SO GOOD, HE CALLED
MICHAEL MURPHY A FEW MONTHS
LATER AND ASKED IF HE COULD HELP

19:49.421 --> 19:57.129
DESIGN A BRAND NEW HOSPITAL FOR
A REMOTE DISTRICT OF 350,000,
THAT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A DOCTOR.
YOU'RE STILL A STUDENT.

19:57.195 --> 20:00.799
>> Murphy: STILL A STUDENT.
SO, I LOOKED AROUND MY
CLASSMATES AND SAID, "THIS CRAZY
CALL CAME IN.

20:00.866 --> 20:06.338
CAN ANYONE HELP ME?"
>> Stahl: YOU SAID YES RIGHT
AWAY, WITHOUT HESITATION.
>> Ricks: YEAH.

20:06.405 --> 20:12.678
I MEAN, WHO-- WHO WOULDN'T?
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY.
>> Stahl: BUT WHEN DR. FARMER
SAID THEIR FIRST DESIGN LOOKED

20:12.744 --> 20:22.888
LIKE AN ARMY BARRACKS, MURPHY
DECIDED TO TAKE A YEAR OFF AND
MOVE TO THE SITE CALLED BUTARO,
WHERE FARMER GAVE HIM THREE

20:22.955 --> 20:30.729
CHALLENGES HE SAYS HAVE DEFINED
MASS' WORK TO THIS DAY: THE
HOSPITAL SHOULD BE BEAUTIFUL;
BUILDING IT SHOULD HELP AS MANY

20:30.796 --> 20:37.536
LOCAL PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE; AND IT
SHOULD HAVE NATURAL AIRFLOW, TO
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASES
LIKE TUBERCULOSIS THAT OFTEN RAN

20:37.603 --> 20:43.008
RAMPANT IN ENCLOSED WARDS AND
WAITING ROOMS.
>> Murphy: LET ME SHOW YOU THIS
IMAGE.

20:43.075 --> 20:50.182
>> Stahl: MURPHY SHOWED US THE
DESIGN THEY CAME UP WITH TO MOVE
FRESH AIR NATURALLY THROUGH EACH
WARD.

20:50.248 --> 20:55.988
>> Murphy: THAT'S SIMPLE
PHYSICS, WHERE AIR MOVES FROM A
LOWER TO HIGHER AREA.
>> Stahl: BEDS WOULD GO IN THE

20:56.054 --> 21:02.628
MIDDLE, GIVING EVERY PATIENT A
BEAUTIFUL VIEW.
>> Murphy: BEAUTY MATTERS.
SPACES AROUND US THAT ARE

21:02.694 --> 21:09.267
DESIGNED WITH BEAUTY SAY THAT WE
MATTER AS INDIVIDUALS.
>> Stahl: IF I WERE A DOCTOR,
WOULDN'T I SAY, "I CARE ABOUT

21:09.334 --> 21:12.804
BEAUTY, BUT I WANT A HEART
MONITOR FIRST"?
>> Farmer: WHY MAKE THIS A
CHOICE BETWEEN A HEART MONITOR

21:12.871 --> 21:20.912
AND BEAUTY?
SURELY, WE CAN HAVE BOTH.
>> Stahl: WHAT THEY COULDN'T
HAVE?

21:20.979 --> 21:25.217
HEAVY EQUIPMENT LIKE FRONT-END
LOADERS, THAT WERE TOO COSTLY TO
GET TO THE SITE.
>> Murphy: AND SO, WE ASKED,

21:25.283 --> 21:31.089
"COULD WE DIG IT BY HAND?"
AND WE DUG THE FOUNDATION BY
HAND.
EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE.

21:31.156 --> 21:34.459
AND, YOU KNOW, SHOCKER-- WE DID
IT FASTER AND CHEAPER THAN...
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
...THAN IF...

21:34.526 --> 21:38.030
>> Stahl: THAN IF YOU HAD THE
BIG...
>> Murphy: ...THAN IF WE HAD THE
FRONT-END LOADER.

21:38.096 --> 21:41.366
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: HOW MANY PEOPLE
ACTUALLY WORKED ON THIS PROJECT,
TOTAL?

21:41.433 --> 21:47.272
>> Murphy: OVER 4,000 PEOPLE
WORKED ON THE PROJECT.
>> Stahl: AND INSTEAD OF
TRUCKING IN MATERIALS, THEY

21:47.339 --> 21:54.513
DECIDED TO USE VOLCANIC STONE
THAT FARMERS HERE CONSIDER A
NUISANCE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO
CLEAR IT FROM THEIR FIELDS.

21:54.579 --> 21:59.151
>> Ricks: YOU SEE THE STONE
EVERYWHERE, BUT NORMALLY IT'S
JUST PILED UP.
AND WE THOUGHT, THIS WOULD BE A

21:59.217 --> 22:06.291
REALLY VALUABLE MATERIAL IN-- IN
THE U.S., YOU KNOW.
COULD WE USE IT IN A DIFFERENT
WAY?

22:06.358 --> 22:14.866
>> Stahl: THEY DESIGNED THE
WHOLE HOSPITAL FACADE WITH IT,
HIRING DOZENS OF LOCAL MASONS
AND SPAWNING A NEW INDUSTRY.

22:14.933 --> 22:22.607
THIS WOMAN, WHO TRAINED AT
BUTARO, IS NOW A FOREWOMAN WITH
A TEAM OF MASONS SHE TRAINS.
>> Benimana: THE AMOUNT OF HOURS

22:22.674 --> 22:30.716
THEY SPENT DOING THIS.
>> Stahl: CHRISTIAN BENIMANA,
BACK FROM SHANGHAI, WAS
IMPRESSED BY THE THOUGHT GIVEN

22:30.782 --> 22:35.921
TO THE PROCESS OF BUILDING AND,
BY GIVING SO MANY PEOPLE WORK,
IMPROVING THE LOCAL ECONOMY.
>> Benimana: IT IS CRITICAL FOR

22:35.987 --> 22:42.661
US TO HAVE PROSPECT FOR A BETTER
FUTURE.
>> Stahl: AND GIVE PEOPLE PRIDE
IN RWANDA.

22:42.728 --> 22:48.600
>> Benimana: THAT'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE I--
MAKE ME PROUD, AS WELL.
>> Stahl: HE JOINED THE TEAM AND

22:48.667 --> 22:53.605
HELPED DESIGN HOUSING FOR
DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL.
>> Ricks: VERY QUICKLY, WE HAD A
LOT OF WORK, BECAUSE THERE

22:53.672 --> 23:00.712
WEREN'T MANY OTHER PEOPLE DOING
THIS.
>> Stahl: THEY DECIDED TO BECOME
A NON-PROFIT ARCHITECTURE FIRM,

23:00.779 --> 23:09.621
TO WORK ON PROJECTS THAT
OTHERWISE COULDN'T AFFORD
HIGH-PRICED DESIGNS.
THEY'VE BUILT A MATERNITY CARE

23:09.688 --> 23:18.730
CENTER IN MALAWI, A CHOLERA
HOSPITAL IN HAITI, SCHOOLS-- ALL
WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF AIR
FLOW, BEAUTY, AND CREATING JOBS.

23:18.797 --> 23:24.703
A DECADE LATER, THEY HAVE A
STAFF OF OVER 200, MORE THAN
HALF OF THEM RWANDAN.
THIS TREE IS EVEN MORE

23:24.770 --> 23:33.712
BEAUTIFUL, CLOSE UP.
WE VISITED BUTARO HOSPITAL THIS
SUMMER.
ITS CENTRAL COURTYARD FELT

23:33.779 --> 23:39.451
PART-MEDICAL CENTER, PART-PUBLIC
GARDENS, AND ITS COVERED OUTDOOR
WAITING ROOM AND HALLWAYS IN
THIS TIME OF COVID FELT

23:39.518 --> 23:46.591
PRESCIENT.
>> Murphy: THIS ENTIRE HOSPITAL
IS DESIGNED AROUND THAT SIMPLE
IDEA THAT AIR FLOW, AIR

23:46.658 --> 23:52.197
MOVEMENT, ARE THE BASIC PREMISE
THAT WE SHOULD DESIGN OUR
BUILDINGS AROUND-- AND, IN
PARTICULAR, OUR HOSPITALS, SO

23:52.264 --> 24:00.705
THAT PATIENTS DON'T TRANSMIT
AIRBORNE DISEASES TO EACH OTHER.
>> Stahl: FOUR HOURS TO THE
SOUTH, WE WENT TO SEE MASS'

24:00.772 --> 24:09.014
LARGEST PROJECT YET, A
69-BUILDING CAMPUS FOR A
BRAND-NEW COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE
FUNDED BY AMERICAN

24:09.080 --> 24:13.151
PHILANTHROPIST HOWARD BUFFETT...
>> Ricks: THIS SPACE IS REALLY--
WE WANT TO CREATE A HUB.
>> Stahl: IT'S SPECTACULAR.

24:13.218 --> 24:21.493
...WHERE MASS IS PUSHING ITS
PHILOSOPHY TO THE LIMIT.
AS ALAN RICKS SHOWED US, JUST
ABOUT EVERYTHING HERE, FROM THE

24:21.560 --> 24:25.997
EARTHEN WALLS...
>> Ricks: THE LINES YOU SEE ARE
THE LAYERS.
>> Stahl: ...TO THE FURNITURE...

24:26.064 --> 24:30.936
>> Ricks: THE WOVEN BACK-RESTS
OF THESE CHAIRS.
>> Stahl: ...IS BEING MADE
LOCALLY.

24:31.002 --> 24:39.344
UNDER CHRISTIAN BENIMANA'S
LEADERSHIP, MASS STARTED A
FURNITURE DIVISION TO
COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL ARTISANS

24:39.411 --> 24:46.885
ON CREATIVE DESIGNS, INSTEAD OF
ORDERING FROM A CATALOGUE.
>> Benimana: IT'S ONE THING TO
GO TO DUBAI AND TURKEY AND CHINA

24:46.952 --> 24:53.458
AND EUROPE AND PICK A CHAIR FROM
A SHOWROOM, PUT IT ON A FLIGHT
AND BRING IT HERE; IT'S ANOTHER
THING TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM

24:53.525 --> 24:59.130
THAT CAN CREATE MORE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH.
>> Stahl: AND IF YOU'RE THINKING
MASS' MODEL COULD NEVER WORK IN

24:59.197 --> 25:06.338
THE U.S.?
MICHAEL MURPHY WASN'T SURE,
EITHER-- UNTIL HE WAS CHALLENGED
BY A COMMUNITY LEADER BACK HOME.

25:06.404 --> 25:10.475
>> Murphy: HE SAID, "YOU'RE
DOING ALL THIS WORK IN HAITI AND
RWANDA.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK

25:10.542 --> 25:17.048
TO YOUR HOMETOWN AND WORK WITH
US IN POUGHKEEPSIE?
WE NEED A LOT OF HELP."
>> Stahl: POUGHKEEPSIE, LIKE

25:17.115 --> 25:23.455
MANY ONCE-THRIVING INDUSTRIAL
CITIES, HAD SEEN FACTORIES
CLOSE, ITS DOWNTOWN CHOKED OFF
BY HIGHWAYS, ITS STOREFRONTS

25:23.521 --> 25:31.429
BOARDED UP.
TO TOP IT OFF, ITS CREEK FLOODED
DURING HURRICANE IRENE.
>> Murphy: WE HAD JUST BEEN IN

25:31.496 --> 25:38.003
ONE OF THE MOST RURAL PLACES IN
THE WORLD, AND WE HAD SEEN A
HOSPITAL CHANGE THE ECONOMY.
I SAID, "WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT

25:38.069 --> 25:46.711
SAME THING HERE IN
POUGHKEEPSIE?"
>> Stahl: SO, MASS OPENED A
SMALL OFFICE ON MAIN STREET AND

25:46.778 --> 25:54.619
GOT TO WORK CONVERTING THE
CITY'S OLD TROLLEY BARN INTO AN
ART SPACE AND DESIGNING HOUSING.
IT'S HELPING TURN THIS OLD

25:54.686 --> 25:59.324
BUILDING INTO A FOOD HALL...
>> WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THIS
BUILDING.
>> Stahl: ...AND CONVERTING THIS

25:59.391 --> 26:06.097
LONG-ABANDONED FACTORY INTO A
NEW HEADQUARTERS FOR THE
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SCENIC
HUDSON.

26:06.164 --> 26:10.335
>> Murphy: IF YOU LOOK UP, YOU
CAN SEE THAT THIS WHOLE OPENING
WAS ONCE A WINDOW.
>> Stahl: THAT WAS A WINDOW?

26:10.402 --> 26:14.873
>> Murphy: THAT WAS ALL A
WINDOW.
>> Stahl: OH, MY GOODNESS.
MURPHY SAYS OLD BUILDINGS LIKE

26:14.940 --> 26:22.881
THIS WERE DESIGNED TO LET IN
FRESH AIR, BUT WITH THE
INVENTION OF AIR CONDITIONING,
"BIG WINDOWS BECAME A LIABILITY,

26:22.948 --> 26:30.989
SO WE SHRUNK THEM AND SEALED OUR
BUILDINGS AIR-TIGHT."
>> Murphy: THIS IS A SORT OF
DEVIL'S BARGAIN, BECAUSE IT HAS

26:31.056 --> 26:36.294
MADE ALL OF OUR BUILDINGS HAVE
REALLY LIMITED AIR FLOW.
AND HENCE, DURING COVID, WE WERE
ALL VERY VULNERABLE.

26:36.361 --> 26:42.033
>> Stahl: WE SAW IT WITH THE
NURSING HOMES.
>> Murphy: AND THE PRISONS.
>> Stahl: DO YOU THINK THAT

26:42.100 --> 26:48.707
COVID WILL CHANGE ARCHITECTURE
FOR EVERYBODY?
>> Murphy: EVERYONE AROUND THE
WORLD IS GOING THROUGH A SHIFT

26:48.773 --> 26:57.148
IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE
BUILDINGS AROUND US-- THAT THEY
MAY MAKE US SICKER; THAT THEY
COULD MAKE US HEALTHIER IF THEY

26:57.215 --> 27:06.725
WERE BETTER DESIGNED.
>> Stahl: MASS' NEW DESIGN WILL
REOPEN THE WINDOWS AND, LIKE A
CUTTING-EDGE VERSION OF THE

27:06.791 --> 27:13.031
HOSPITAL IN RWANDA, USE A SOLAR-
POWERED SYSTEM TO HEAT AND COOL
AIR AT EACH WINDOW, ELIMINATING
TRADITIONAL AIR CONDITIONING AND

27:13.098 --> 27:21.473
HEATING ENTIRELY.
AND, THEY HAVE A PLAN TO
TRANSFORM THAT FLOODING CREEK
THAT HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A

27:21.539 --> 27:25.977
GARBAGE DUMP.
>> Sierra Bainbridge: SOME
GUTTERS.
WE GET SHOPPING CARTS.

27:26.044 --> 27:29.781
>> Stahl: WHAT IS THAT?
AN AIR CONDITIONER?
>> Bainbridge: MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

27:29.848 --> 27:34.886
>> Stahl: MASS LANDSCAPE
ARCHITECT SIERRA BAINBRIDGE CAME
HERE WITH IDEAS ABOUT WIDENING
THE CREEK TO HELP WITH FLOODING,

27:34.953 --> 27:42.727
BUT ALSO...
>> Bainbridge: IF YOU'RE TAKING
A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE PROBLEM,
THEN THE SOLUTION ALSO BEGINS TO

27:42.794 --> 27:50.001
BE A HOLISTIC VIEW.
>> Stahl: MASS CAME UP WITH
DESIGNS TO TURN THE BLIGHTED
CREEK INTO BEAUTIFUL PARK SPACE

27:50.068 --> 27:56.041
THAT WOULD RUN ALL THROUGH
POUGHKEEPSIE.
>> Bainbridge: EACH PROJECT HAS
TO NOT SOLVE FOR THAT ONE THING.

27:56.107 --> 28:00.712
WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW
MUCH CAN WE MAKE DESIGN HAVE THE
BIGGEST POSSIBLE IMPACT?
>> Stahl: IT'S A LESSON MASS

28:00.779 --> 28:06.718
BELIEVES CAN APPLY IN MANY
AMERICAN CITIES.
THEY HAVE PROJECTS NOW IN
CLEVELAND, BIRMINGHAM, AND

28:06.785 --> 28:14.859
SANTA FE.
AND THEIR GOSPEL OF ARCHITECTURE
SERVING SOCIETY HAS REACHED
INSIDE THAT IVORY TOWER, WHOSE

28:14.926 --> 28:22.600
TEACHINGS THEY ONCE FOUND
LACKING.
LAST SPRING, MURPHY TAUGHT
LESSONS HE LEARNED IN RWANDA,

28:22.667 --> 28:28.273
BACK AT HARVARD.
>> Murphy: THERE'S SOME CLEAR
SIMPLICITY TO IT-- THERE'S
THINGS WE HAVE TO BUILD, THERE'S

28:28.339 --> 28:34.179
PEOPLE WE HAVE TO HIRE, THERE'S
MATERIALS WE HAVE TO USE.
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE
THING AS A DESIGN PROJECT, YOU

28:34.245 --> 28:36.781
CAN HAVE A LOT MORE IMPACT.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:41.086 --> 28:46.991
>><i> WHY DOES AN ARCHITECTURE FIRM</i>
<i>EMPLOY FILMMAKERS?</i>
>> HOPEFULLY, PEOPLE START
DEMANDING SOMETHING DIFFERENT

28:47.058 --> 28:53.698
FROM THE BUILDINGS THAT THEY
LIVE IN.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.403
(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:59.270 --> 29:06.911
>> Anderson Cooper: WHEN YUVAL
NOAH HARARI PUBLISHED HIS FIRST
BOOK "SAPIENS" IN 2014 ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES, IT

29:06.978 --> 29:13.051
BECAME A GLOBAL BESTSELLER AND
TURNED THE LITTLE-KNOWN ISRAELI
HISTORY PROFESSOR INTO ONE OF
THE MOST POPULAR WRITERS AND

29:13.118 --> 29:19.057
THINKERS ON THE PLANET.
BUT WHEN WE MET WITH HARARI IN
TEL AVIV THIS SUMMER, IT WASN'T
OUR SPECIES' PAST THAT CONCERNED

29:19.124 --> 29:27.065
HIM; IT WAS OUR FUTURE.
HARARI BELIEVES WE MAY BE ON THE
BRINK OF CREATING NOT JUST A
NEW, ENHANCED SPECIES OF HUMAN,

29:27.132 --> 29:34.873
BUT AN ENTIRELY NEW KIND OF
BEING, ONE THAT IS FAR MORE
INTELLIGENT THAN WE ARE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION,

29:34.939 --> 29:39.444
BUT YUVAL NOAH HARARI SAYS IT'S
ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DANGEROUS
THAN THAT.
YOU SAID, "WE ARE ONE OF THE

29:39.511 --> 29:45.283
LAST GENERATIONS OF HOMO
SAPIENS.
WITHIN A CENTURY OR TWO, EARTH
WILL BE DOMINATED BY ENTITIES

29:45.350 --> 29:48.820
THAT ARE MORE DIFFERENT FROM US
THAN WE ARE DIFFERENT FROM
CHIMPANZEES."
>> Yuval Noah Harari: YEAH.

29:48.887 --> 29:55.059
>> Cooper: WHAT THE HELL DOES
THAT MEAN?
THAT FREAKED ME OUT.
>> Harari: YOU KNOW WE WILL SOON

29:55.126 --> 30:03.201
HAVE THE POWER TO RE-ENGINEER
OUR BODIES AND BRAINS-- WHETHER
IT IS WITH GENETIC ENGINEERING;
OR BY DIRECTLY CONNECTING BRAINS

30:03.268 --> 30:13.044
TO COMPUTERS; OR BY CREATING
COMPLETELY NON-ORGANIC ENTITIES,
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS
NOT BASED AT ALL ON THE ORGANIC

30:13.111 --> 30:21.119
BODY AND THE ORGANIC BRAIN.
AND THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE
DEVELOPING AT BREAK-NECK SPEED.
>> Cooper: IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN

30:21.186 --> 30:27.192
IT CREATES A WHOLE OTHER
SPECIES.
>> Harari: THIS IS SOMETHING
WHICH IS WAY BEYOND JUST ANOTHER

30:27.258 --> 30:34.832
SPECIES.
>> Cooper: YUVAL NOAH HARARI IS
TALKING ABOUT THE RACE TO
DEVELOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,

30:34.899 --> 30:43.041
AS WELL AS OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
LIKE GENE EDITING, THAT COULD
ONE DAY ENABLE PARENTS TO CREATE
SMARTER OR MORE ATTRACTIVE

30:43.107 --> 30:49.080
CHILDREN, AND BRAIN COMPUTER
INTERFACES THAT COULD RESULT IN
HUMAN/MACHINE HYBRIDS.
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO A SOCIETY?

30:49.147 --> 30:57.989
IT SEEMS LIKE THE RICH WILL HAVE
ACCESS, WHEREAS OTHERS WOULDN'T.
>> Harari: ONE OF THE DANGERS IS
THAT WE WILL SEE IN THE COMING

30:58.056 --> 31:05.530
DECADES, A PROCESS OF, OF-- OF--
GREATER INEQUALITY THAN IN ANY
PREVIOUS TIME IN HISTORY,
BECAUSE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT

31:05.597 --> 31:13.037
WILL BE REAL, BIOLOGICAL
INEQUALITY.
IF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE
AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE RICH OR

31:13.104 --> 31:23.047
ONLY TO PEOPLE FROM A CERTAIN
COUNTRY, THEN HOMO SAPIENS WILL
SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL
CASTES, BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAVE

31:23.114 --> 31:31.055
DIFFERENT BODIES AND-- AND
DIFFERENT ABILITIES.
>> Cooper: HARARI HAS SPENT THE
LAST FEW YEARS LECTURING AND

31:31.122 --> 31:37.061
WRITING ABOUT WHAT MAY LIE AHEAD
FOR HUMANKIND.
>> Harari: IN THE COMING
GENERATIONS, WE WILL LEARN HOW

31:37.128 --> 31:44.969
TO ENGINEER BODIES AND BRAINS
AND MINDS.
>> Cooper: HE HAS WRITTEN TWO
BOOKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE

31:45.036 --> 31:51.175
FACE IN THE FUTURE, "HOMO DEUS"
AND "21 LESSONS FOR THE 21st
CENTURY," WHICH, ALONG WITH
"SAPIENS" HAVE SOLD MORE THAN 35

31:51.242 --> 31:58.616
MILLION COPIES AND BEEN
TRANSLATED INTO 65 LANGUAGES.
HIS WRITINGS HAVE BEEN
RECOMMENDED BY PRESIDENT BARACK

31:58.683 --> 32:04.856
OBAMA AS WELL AS TECH MOGULS
BILL GATES AND MARK ZUCKERBERG.
YOU RAISE WARNINGS ABOUT
TECHNOLOGY.

32:04.922 --> 32:10.161
YOU'RE ALSO EMBRACED BY A LOT OF
FOLKS IN SILICON VALLEY.
>> Harari: YEAH.
>> Cooper: ISN'T THAT SORT OF A

32:10.228 --> 32:18.703
CONTRADICTION?
>> Harari: THEY ARE A BIT AFRAID
OF THEIR OWN POWER; THAT THEY
HAVE REALIZED THE IMMENSE

32:18.770 --> 32:23.708
INFLUENCE THEY HAVE OVER THE
WORLD, OVER THE COURSE OF
EVOLUTION, REALLY.
AND I THINK THAT SPOOKS AT LEAST

32:23.775 --> 32:31.049
SOME OF THEM, AND THAT'S A GOOD
THING.
AND THIS IS WHY THEY ARE KIND
OF, TO SOME EXTENT, OPEN TO

32:31.115 --> 32:39.190
LISTENING.
>> Cooper: YOU STARTED AS A
HISTORY PROFESSOR.
WHAT DO YOU CALL YOURSELF NOW?

32:39.257 --> 32:45.196
>> Harari: I'M STILL A
HISTORIAN, BUT I THINK HISTORY
IS THE STUDY OF CHANGE, NOT JUST
THE STUDY OF THE PAST.

32:45.263 --> 32:52.503
BUT IT COVERS THE FUTURE, AS
WELL.
>> Cooper: HARARI GOT HIS Ph.D.
IN HISTORY AT OXFORD AND LIVES

32:52.570 --> 32:59.210
IN ISRAEL, WHERE THE PAST IS
STILL VERY PRESENT.
HE TOOK US TO THIS ARCHEOLOGICAL
SITE CALLED TEL GEZER.

32:59.277 --> 33:07.051
>> Harari: 4,000 OR 5,000 YEARS
AGO, THIS WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CITIES IN THE AREA.
>> Cooper: HARARI SAYS CITIES

33:07.118 --> 33:13.057
LIKE THIS WERE ONLY POSSIBLE
BECAUSE ABOUT 70,000 YEARS AGO,
OUR SPECIES, HOMO SAPIENS,
EXPERIENCED A COGNITIVE CHANGE

33:13.124 --> 33:21.199
THAT HELPED US CREATE LANGUAGE,
WHICH THEN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
US TO COOPERATE IN LARGE GROUPS
AND DRIVE NEANDERTHALS AND ALL

33:21.265 --> 33:29.440
OTHER LESS-COOPERATIVE HUMAN
SPECIES INTO EXTINCTION.
HARARI FEARS WE ARE NOW THE ONES
AT RISK OF BEING DOMINATED BY

33:29.507 --> 33:35.213
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
>> Harari: MAYBE THE BIGGEST
THING THAT WE ARE FACING IS
REALLY A KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY

33:35.279 --> 33:42.587
DIVERGENCE.
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS,
INTELLIGENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS
WENT TOGETHER.

33:42.653 --> 33:49.060
CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE ABILITY TO
FEEL THINGS LIKE PAIN AND
PLEASURE AND LOVE AND HATE.
INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY TO

33:49.127 --> 33:56.734
SOLVE PROBLEMS.
BUT COMPUTERS OR ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE, THEY DON'T HAVE
CONSCIOUSNESS.

33:56.801 --> 34:01.038
THEY JUST HAVE INTELLIGENCE.
THEY SOLVE PROBLEMS IN A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY THAN
US.

34:01.105 --> 34:07.378
NOW, IN SCIENCE FICTION, IT'S
OFTEN ASSUMED THAT AS COMPUTERS
WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE
INTELLIGENT, THEY WILL

34:07.445 --> 34:15.186
INEVITABLY ALSO GAIN
CONSCIOUSNESS.
BUT ACTUALLY, IT'S-- IT'S MUCH
MORE FRIGHTENING THAN THAT; IN A

34:15.253 --> 34:20.458
WAY, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE
MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS, BETTER
THAN US, WITHOUT HAVING ANY
CONSCIOUSNESS, ANY FEELINGS.

34:20.525 --> 34:24.996
>> Cooper: AND THEY WILL HAVE
POWER OVER US?
>> Harari: THEY ARE ALREADY
GAINING POWER OVER US.

34:25.062 --> 34:31.269
>> Cooper: SOME LENDERS
ROUTINELY USE COMPLEX ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS TO
DETERMINE WHO QUALIFIES FOR

34:31.335 --> 34:38.876
LOANS, AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL
MARKETS ARE MOVED BY DECISIONS
MADE BY MACHINES ANALYZING HUGE
AMOUNTS OF DATA IN WAYS EVEN

34:38.943 --> 34:45.716
THEIR PROGRAMMERS DON'T ALWAYS
UNDERSTAND.
HARARI SAYS THE COUNTRIES AND
COMPANIES THAT CONTROL THE MOST

34:45.783 --> 34:51.189
DATA WILL IN THE FUTURE BE THE
ONES THAT CONTROL THE WORLD.
>> Harari: TODAY, IN THE WORLD,
DATA IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN

34:51.255 --> 34:57.495
MONEY.
TEN YEARS AGO, YOU HAD THESE BIG
CORPORATIONS PAYING BILLIONS AND
BILLIONS FOR WHATSAPP, FOR

34:57.562 --> 35:03.201
INSTAGRAM.
AND PEOPLE WONDERED, "ARE THEY
CRAZY?
WHY DO THEY PAY BILLIONS TO GET

35:03.267 --> 35:09.540
THIS APPLICATION THAT DOESN'T
PRODUCE ANY MONEY?"
AND THE REASON WHY?
BECAUSE IT PRODUCED DATA.

35:09.607 --> 35:17.849
>> Cooper: AND DATA IS THE KEY?
>> Harari: THE WORLD IS
INCREASINGLY KIND OF CUT UP INTO
SPHERES OF-- OF-- OF-- OF DATA

35:17.915 --> 35:23.287
COLLECTION, OF DATA HARVESTING.
IN THE COLD WAR, YOU HAD THE
IRON CURTAIN.
NOW, WE HAVE THE SILICON CURTAIN

35:23.354 --> 35:31.062
BETWEEN THE U.S.A. AND CHINA.
AND WHERE DOES THE DATA GO?
CALIFORNIA.
OR DOES IT GO TO SHENZHEN AND TO

35:31.128 --> 35:37.034
SHANGHAI AND TO BEIJING?
>> Cooper: HARARI IS CONCERNED
THE PANDEMIC HAS OPENED THE DOOR
FOR MORE INTRUSIVE KINDS OF DATA

35:37.101 --> 35:43.040
COLLECTION, INCLUDING BIOMETRIC
DATA.
WHAT IS BIOMETRIC DATA?
>> Harari: IT'S DATA ABOUT

35:43.107 --> 35:50.915
WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE MY BODY.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR, IT'S
CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS
COLLECTING DATA ABOUT WHERE WE

35:50.982 --> 35:59.190
GO, WHO WE MEET, WHAT MOVIES WE
WATCH.
THE NEXT PHASE IS SURVEILLANCE
GOING UNDER OUR SKIN.

35:59.257 --> 36:05.763
>> Cooper: I'M WEARING A-- LIKE,
A TRACKER, THAT TRACKS MY HEART
RATE, MY SLEEP.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT

36:05.830 --> 36:11.202
INFORMATION IS GOING.
>> Harari: YOU WEAR THE K.G.B.
AGENT ON YOUR WRIST WILLINGLY.
>> Cooper: AND<i> I</i> THINK IT'S

36:11.269 --> 36:16.841
BENEFITING ME.
>> Harari: AND IT<i> IS</i> BENEFITING
YOU.
I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING IS THAT

36:16.908 --> 36:22.480
IT'S NOT JUST DYSTOPIAN, IT'S
ALSO UTOPIAN.
I MEAN, THIS KIND OF DATA CAN
ALSO ENABLE US TO CREATE THE

36:22.547 --> 36:27.285
BEST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN
HISTORY.
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ELSE IS
BEING DONE WITH THAT DATA?

36:27.351 --> 36:35.226
AND WHO SUPERVISES IT?
WHO REGULATES IT?
>> Cooper: EARLIER THIS YEAR,
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT GAVE ITS

36:35.293 --> 36:41.899
CITIZENS' HEALTH DATA TO PFIZER
TO GET PRIORITY ACCESS TO THEIR
VACCINE.
THE DATA DID NOT INCLUDE

36:41.966 --> 36:49.040
INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS' IDENTITIES.
SO, WHAT DOES PFIZER WANT THE
DATA OF ALL ISRAELIS FOR?
>> Harari: BECAUSE, TO DEVELOP

36:49.106 --> 36:57.848
NEW MEDICINES, NEW TREATMENTS,
YOU NEED THE MEDICAL DATA.
INCREASINGLY, THAT'S THE BASIS
FOR HOW-- FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH.

36:57.915 --> 37:03.187
IT'S NOT ALL BAD.
>> Cooper: HARARI HAS BEEN
CRITICIZED FOR POINTING OUT
PROBLEMS WITHOUT OFFERING

37:03.254 --> 37:11.195
SOLUTIONS, BUT HE DOES HAVE SOME
IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO LIMIT THE
MISUSE OF DATA.
>> Harari: ONE KEY RULE IS THAT

37:11.262 --> 37:19.036
IF YOU GET MY DATA, THE DATA
SHOULD BE USED TO HELP ME, AND
NOT TO MANIPULATE ME.
ANOTHER KEY RULE?

37:19.103 --> 37:28.746
THAT WHENEVER YOU INCREASE
SURVEILLANCE OF INDIVIDUALS, YOU
SHOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE
SURVEILLANCE OF THE CORPORATION

37:28.813 --> 37:35.219
AND GOVERNMENTS AND THE PEOPLE
AT THE TOP.
AND THE THIRD PRINCIPLE IS THAT,
NEVER ALLOW ALL THE DATA TO BE

37:35.286 --> 37:43.060
CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE.
THAT'S THE RECIPE FOR A
DICTATORSHIP.
NETFLIX TELLS US WHAT TO WATCH,

37:43.127 --> 37:51.736
AND AMAZON TELLS US WHAT TO BUY.
EVENTUALLY, WITHIN 10 OR 20 OR
30 YEARS, SUCH ALGORITHMS COULD
ALSO TELL YOU WHAT TO STUDY AT

37:51.802 --> 37:59.677
COLLEGE, AND WHERE TO WORK, AND
WHOM TO MARRY, AND EVEN WHOM TO
VOTE FOR.
>> Cooper: WITHOUT GREATER

37:59.744 --> 38:06.250
REGULATION, HARARI BELIEVES WE
ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING WHAT HE
CALLS "HACKED HUMANS."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:06.317 --> 38:13.057
>> Harari: TO HACK A HUMAN BEING
IS TO GET TO KNOW THAT PERSON
BETTER THAN THEY KNOW
THEMSELVES, AND BASED ON THAT,

38:13.124 --> 38:22.266
TO INCREASINGLY MANIPULATE YOU.
THIS OUTSIDE SYSTEM, IT HAS THE
POTENTIAL TO REMEMBER
EVERYTHING--<i> EVERYTHING</i> YOU EVER

38:22.333 --> 38:31.042
DID, AND TO ANALYZE AND FIND
PATTERNS IN THIS DATA AND TO GET
A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHO YOU
REALLY ARE.

38:31.108 --> 38:37.314
I CAME OUT AS GAY WHEN I WAS 21.
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN OBVIOUS TO ME
WHEN I WAS 15 THAT I'M GAY, BUT
SOMETHING IN THE MIND BLOCKED

38:37.381 --> 38:45.489
IT.
NOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT A
TEENAGER TODAY, FACEBOOK CAN
KNOW THAT THEY ARE GAY, OR

38:45.556 --> 38:54.365
AMAZON CAN KNOW THAT THEY ARE
GAY LONG BEFORE THEY DO, JUST
BASED ON ANALYZING PATTERNS.
>> Cooper: AND BASED ON THAT,

38:54.432 --> 38:59.403
YOU CAN TELL SOMEBODY'S SEXUAL
ORIENTATION?
>> Harari: COMPLETELY.
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF YOU

38:59.470 --> 39:06.110
LIVE IN IRAN OR IF YOU LIVE IN
RUSSIA OR IN SOME OTHER
HOMOPHOBIC COUNTRY, AND THE
POLICE KNOW THAT YOU ARE GAY

39:06.177 --> 39:13.050
EVEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT?
>> Cooper: WHEN PEOPLE THINK
ABOUT DATA, THEY THINK ABOUT
COMPANIES FINDING OUT WHAT THEIR

39:13.117 --> 39:20.658
LIKES AND DISLIKES ARE.
BUT THE DATA THAT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT GOES MUCH DEEPER THAN
THAT?

39:20.725 --> 39:27.198
>> Harari: LIKE, THINK IN 20
YEARS, WHEN THE ENTIRE PERSONAL
HISTORY OF EVERY JOURNALIST,
EVERY JUDGE, EVERY POLITICIAN,

39:27.264 --> 39:35.206
EVERY MILITARY OFFICER, IS HELD
BY SOMEBODY IN BEIJING OR IN
WASHINGTON.
YOUR ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THEM

39:35.272 --> 39:42.012
IS LIKE NOTHING BEFORE IN
HISTORY.
>> Cooper: HARARI LIVES OUTSIDE
TEL AVIV WITH HIS HUSBAND, ITZIK

39:42.079 --> 39:47.184
YAHAV.
THEY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR
NEARLY 20 YEARS.
IT WAS YAHAV WHO READ HARARI'S

39:47.251 --> 39:54.558
LECTURE NOTES FOR A HISTORY
COURSE AND CONVINCED HIM TO TURN
THEM INTO HIS FIRST BOOK,
"SAPIENS."

39:54.625 --> 39:59.330
>> Itzik Yahav: I READ THE
LESSONS; I COULDN'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT.
FOR ME, IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT

39:59.396 --> 40:07.138
COULD BE A HUGE BESTSELLER.
>> Cooper: YAHAV IS NOW HARARI'S
AGENT, AND TOGETHER THEY STARTED
A COMPANY CALLED SAPIENSHIP.

40:07.204 --> 40:14.044
THEY ARE CREATING AN INTERACTIVE
EXHIBIT THAT WILL TAKE VISITORS
THROUGH THE HISTORY OF HUMAN
EVOLUTION, AND CHALLENGE THEM TO

40:14.111 --> 40:21.519
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF
MANKIND.
HARARI ALSO JUST PUBLISHED THE
SCOND INSTALLMENT OF A GRAPHIC

40:21.585 --> 40:27.057
NOVEL BASED ON "SAPIENS," AND
HE'S TEACHING COURSES AT
ISRAEL'S HEBREW UNIVERSITY IN
ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY FOR

40:27.124 --> 40:34.298
COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND BIO-
ENGINEERS.
>> Harari: WHEN PEOPLE WRITE
CODE, THEY ARE RESHAPING

40:34.365 --> 40:39.503
POLITICS AND ECONOMICS AND
ETHICS, AND THE STRUCTURE OF
HUMAN SOCIETY.
>> Cooper: WHEN I THINK OF

40:39.570 --> 40:47.178
CODERS AND ENGINEERS, I DON'T
THINK OF PHILOSOPHERS AND POETS.
>> Harari: IT'S NOT THE CASE
NOW, BUT IT SHOULD BE THE CASE,

40:47.244 --> 40:55.052
BECAUSE THEY ARE INCREASINGLY
SOLVING PHILOSOPHICAL AND
POETICAL RIDDLES.
IF YOU'RE DESIGNING, YOU KNOW, A

40:55.119 --> 41:03.194
SELF-DRIVING CAR, SO, THE
SELF-DRIVING CAR WILL NEED TO
MAKE ETHICAL DECISIONS LIKE,
SUDDENLY, A KID JUMPS IN FRONT

41:03.260 --> 41:10.701
OF THE CAR AND THE ONLY WAY TO--
TO-- TO PREVENT RUNNING OVER THE
KID IS TO SWERVE TO THE SIDE AND
BE HIT BY A TRUCK, AND YOUR OWN-

41:10.768 --> 41:17.141
- OWNER, WHO IS ASLEEP IN THE
BACK SEAT, WILL-- MIGHT BE
KILLED.
YOU NEED TO TELL THE ALGORITHM

41:17.208 --> 41:22.680
WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION.
SO, YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY SOLVE
THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION, WHO
TO KILL.

41:22.746 --> 41:27.484
>> Cooper: LAST MONTH, THE
UNITED NATIONS SUGGESTED A
MORATORIUM ON ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS THAT

41:27.551 --> 41:35.226
SERIOUSLY THREATEN HUMAN RIGHTS
UNTIL SAFEGUARDS ARE AGREED
UPON, AND ADVISERS TO PRESIDENT
BIDEN ARE PROPOSING WHAT THEY

41:35.292 --> 41:42.700
CALL A "BILL OF RIGHTS" TO GUARD
AGAINST SOME OF THE NEW
TECHNOLOGIES.
HARARI SAYS JUST AS HOMO SAPIENS

41:42.766 --> 41:49.039
LEARNED TO COOPERATE WITH EACH
OTHER MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS
AGO, WE NEED TO COOPERATE NOW.
>> Harari: CERTAINLY.

41:49.106 --> 41:54.311
NOW, WE ARE AT THE POINT WHEN WE
NEED GLOBAL COOPERATION.
YOU CANNOT REGULATE THE
EXPLOSIVE POWER OF ARTIFICIAL

41:54.378 --> 42:01.051
INTELLIGENCE ON A NATIONAL
LEVEL.
I'M NOT TRYING TO KIND OF
PROPHESY WHAT WILL HAPPEN; I'M

42:01.118 --> 42:07.324
TRYING TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT THE
MOST DANGEROUS POSSIBILITIES IN
THE HOPE THAT WE WILL DO
SOMETHING IN THE PRESENT TO

42:07.391 --> 42:11.262
PREVENT THEM.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

42:18.435 --> 42:22.973
>> Stahl: NOW, AN UPDATE ON A
STORY WE REPORTED EARLIER THIS
MONTH.
SCOTT PELLEY SPOKE WITH FRANCES

42:23.040 --> 42:32.316
HAUGEN, THE UP-TO-THEN-ANONYMOUS
FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER.
WHEN SHE LEFT THE COMPANY, SHE
TOOK TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES

42:32.383 --> 42:38.322
OF INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH HER.
>> Pelley: MISINFORMATION, ANGRY
CONTENT IS ENTICING TO PEOPLE
AND KEEP...

42:38.389 --> 42:42.760
>> Haugen: VERY ENTICING.
>> Pelley: ...KEEPS THEM ON THE
PLATFORM.
>> Haugen: YES.

42:42.826 --> 42:49.199
>> Stahl: SINCE THEN, SHE HAS
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE SENATE AND
THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.
IN NOVEMBER, SHE MEETS WITH THE

42:49.266 --> 42:58.242
EUROPEAN UNION.
MORE THAN 18 NEWS ORGANIZATIONS,
INCLUDING CBS NEWS, HAVE JOINED
IN EXAMINING THE RESEARCH, AND

42:58.309 --> 43:06.350
CONGRESS IS LOOKING AT POSSIBLE
REGULATIONS LIMITING HOW SOCIAL
MEDIA MAY HARM YOUNG USERS.
I'M LESLEY STAHL.

43:06.417 --> 43:07.418
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH
