23:57.210 --> 23:58.120
Thanks.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.270
Tattoos?

23:59.550 --> 24:00.990
Oh, yeah.

24:02.820 --> 24:05.000
Oh, fish. You like fish?

24:06.370 --> 24:08.370
Saw it on a scuba diving trip.

24:09.630 --> 24:11.070
Thought it was beautiful.

24:11.070 --> 24:12.440
Mm. I don't like fish.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.620
I like pork, chicken.

24:14.730 --> 24:16.790
But, uh... It's a pretty fish.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.570
Thanks.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.800
It's gonna rub off when I sweat.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.580
No, it won't. It's waterproof.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.890
Stop.

24:25.610 --> 24:27.330
So when this dries...

24:28.650 --> 24:30.250
Should be good to go.
[kisses]

24:31.170 --> 24:32.710
How am I gonna get it off?

24:32.710 --> 24:34.090
Acetone.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.160
Alright Alex, I don't... I don't know if I can...

24:38.160 --> 24:39.420
Hey...

24:39.420 --> 24:40.900
Hey, hey, hey...

24:40.900 --> 24:42.340
Shh...

24:44.680 --> 24:47.030
[inhales, exhales]

24:47.030 --> 24:49.040
You, are a nice...

24:49.040 --> 24:50.700
Young lady, aren't you?

24:52.870 --> 24:54.940
A proper young lady.

24:54.940 --> 24:56.830
[inhales, exhales]

24:56.830 --> 24:59.350
Just picking up her sensible bag in the baggage lane.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.980
Before heading on to her mid-range hotel to go over her schedules.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.390
Museum visits... and fancy dinners.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.750
It's all fine.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.210
It's all good.

25:17.790 --> 25:23.400
And I will meet you in Brussels and everything will work out perfectly, babe. I promise.

25:25.170 --> 25:27.520
It's all gonna be okay.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.100
Are you okay?

25:30.670 --> 25:31.820
Fine.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.420
I guess.

25:34.050 --> 25:35.880
[papers rustle]

25:35.880 --> 25:37.880
What's Po-pey?

25:37.880 --> 25:39.260
Popey.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.730
It's a bath products line I'd started with my friend Polly.

25:44.130 --> 25:46.480
Polly and Piper. Popey.

25:47.050 --> 25:48.830
We're gonna be in Barney's.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.370
Barney's?

25:50.890 --> 25:52.780
It's a nice store.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.220
[papers rustle]
It's a pretty big case.

25:56.790 --> 25:58.450
Criminal conspiracy.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.050
That's what they charged me with.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.800
I carried a suitcase of money.

26:03.260 --> 26:05.090
Drug money.

26:05.090 --> 26:06.470
Once.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.760
Ten years ago.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.880
What's that Statute of Limitations on that?

26:12.140 --> 26:13.510
12 years.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.800
That's tough.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.060
Well...

26:18.490 --> 26:19.810
I did it.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.900
That one time.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.900
10 years ago.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.400
What did your lawyers say?

26:26.400 --> 26:28.800
Except with the mandatory minimums with drug crimes...

26:28.800 --> 26:31.550
He wouldn't recommend risking a trial so I pleaded out.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.100
And here you are.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.700
Here I am.

26:35.270 --> 26:37.850
Costing the tax payers money... and...

26:37.850 --> 26:39.800
Sweating in my armchair.

26:39.800 --> 26:45.470
Y'know. I've been here for 22 years and I still can't figure out how the system works.

26:46.100 --> 26:49.300
I've got a crack dealer who's doing 9 months...

26:49.300 --> 26:53.370
And then I have a lady who accidentally backed into a mailman...

26:53.540 --> 26:55.780
Who's doing 4 years.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.350
I mean the guy broke his collarbone. But come one.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.610
I just don't get it.

27:00.530 --> 27:01.620
[gulps]

27:02.310 --> 27:04.020
Are you gonna barf?

27:04.370 --> 27:07.230
Tell me if you're gonna barf because there's a can behind you.

27:07.230 --> 27:08.720
I won't barf.

27:08.720 --> 27:12.100
I will be truly displeased if you barf anywhere but in that can.

27:12.670 --> 27:14.220
Not gonna barf.

27:16.170 --> 27:17.600
Ms Chapman.

27:19.090 --> 27:22.180
No one's gonna mess with you here...

27:22.180 --> 27:23.780
Unless you let them.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.130
This isn't Oz...

27:26.130 --> 27:28.770
Women fight with gossip and rumors.

27:29.170 --> 27:31.630
They might peg you for rich... and...

27:31.630 --> 27:33.630
Try to hit you up for a commissary.

27:35.470 --> 27:37.300
And there are lesbians.

27:38.330 --> 27:39.930
They're not gonna bother you...

27:40.100 --> 27:41.930
They'll try to be your friend...

27:41.930 --> 27:43.430
Just stay away from them.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.000
I want you to understand...

27:46.350 --> 27:47.840
You do not...

27:47.840 --> 27:49.040
Have to have...

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
Lesbian sex.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.000
I have a fiancée.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.440
Oh.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.010
His name is Larry. He's a writer.

28:04.790 --> 28:06.450
Can he come visit me?

28:06.450 --> 28:08.510
-Is he in here?
-Yes, everybody's in there.

28:08.510 --> 28:11.370
All the people in the PSI are cleared to visit.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.610
He can come this weekend.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.780
I'll make sure the list is in the visiting room.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.960
Thank you so much, Mr. Healy.

28:18.650 --> 28:20.710
You just keep to yourself.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.490
And you'll be fine.

28:22.490 --> 28:24.490
And don't make friends.

28:25.230 --> 28:26.780
And remember...

28:27.070 --> 28:29.070
Nothing... goes on here...

28:29.530 --> 28:30.900
That I don't know about.

28:30.900 --> 28:32.390
You know everything about me.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.390
I d... I tell you everything!

28:35.030 --> 28:39.150
What the webcam horror, the penis shaving incident. How do I not know this?

28:39.150 --> 28:41.440
What was I supposed to say? It was...

28:42.190 --> 28:43.790
It was a phase.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.140
It was my... lost soul...

28:46.140 --> 28:48.260
Post college, adventure phase.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.460
I...

28:49.800 --> 28:52.270
I was so embarrassed. I can't...

28:52.270 --> 28:54.560
I can't believe that she did this.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.450
I can't believe you did this.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.970
I mean who are you? I-I...

28:58.970 --> 29:01.660
Feel like I'm in a-a Borne movie. Have you killed?

29:01.890 --> 29:03.660
[sobs]

29:03.660 --> 29:05.150
Jesus. I don't know.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.040
Baby. Stop, stop, stop.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.530
Come on. Come here.

29:08.530 --> 29:10.190
[shushes]

29:10.420 --> 29:11.340
Okay.

29:11.340 --> 29:13.110
You should break up with me.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.000
-What?
-You didn't sign up for this.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.170
Okay. Stop it, stop it. Come on...

29:17.580 --> 29:19.530
Shh... It's okay.

29:19.530 --> 29:22.680
Okay?

29:25.140 --> 29:28.170
Witness states Piper Chapman carried drug money.

29:28.170 --> 29:30.410
Piper Chapman was part of the ring.

29:30.410 --> 29:31.610
Were you?

29:32.930 --> 29:34.590
I was 22!

29:35.280 --> 29:37.170
I thought that I was in love.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.920
I was in love.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.120
And it...

29:41.120 --> 29:43.700
Was all crazy. And then it got...

29:44.900 --> 29:46.730
Scary.

29:46.730 --> 29:48.450
And I ran away...

29:48.450 --> 29:52.290
And I became the nice blond lady that I was supposed to be.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.770
I knew...

29:54.120 --> 29:56.520
That she wasn't a good person. But...

29:56.520 --> 29:57.900
Fuck her.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.880
Fuck her.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.000
This is not gonna be okay.

30:04.770 --> 30:05.970
-No.
-No.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.040
-It's not.
-Mm-mm.

30:12.790 --> 30:14.560
But we'll deal with it.

30:14.740 --> 30:16.220
Okay?

30:18.290 --> 30:19.780
We'll figure it out.

30:21.090 --> 30:22.750
Have you called a lawyer?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.330
[inhales]
I'll call my dad.

30:25.330 --> 30:28.020
No, no. Please don't call your dad. He already hates me.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.630
Yeah. Well...

30:29.630 --> 30:31.120
I love you.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.430
And...

30:32.430 --> 30:33.980
And he loves me.

30:33.980 --> 30:35.240
So...

30:36.160 --> 30:37.700
Here we go.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.820
Alright we gotta hustle 'cause the count's soon.

30:39.820 --> 30:42.340
Uh, room up there... Dorms are down there.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.120
Now you are not allowed down there.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.440
It's out of bounds for you guys until you got son there. You understand?

30:47.610 --> 30:50.010
Ah! Namaste, Jones!

30:50.010 --> 30:51.160
Namaste.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.620
She teaches yoga, if you ever want. And she's good.

30:53.620 --> 30:55.160
She's very spiritual.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.000
Alright we got some offices here...

30:57.000 --> 31:00.210
This is the... dining hall... common room... counselor's office...

31:00.270 --> 31:01.810
Who-who you got for a counselor? 

31:01.810 --> 31:03.070
Um, Healy.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.680
Okay, yeah.

31:04.680 --> 31:05.540
What?

31:05.540 --> 31:08.740
Oh... it's fine. It's fine. He does his paperwork. That's the good thing.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.610
When do we get outfits like everybody?

31:11.610 --> 31:12.980
I dunno... maybe...

31:12.980 --> 31:15.960
Tomorrow... after breakfast... you go down and you speak to a lady...

31:16.650 --> 31:18.130
[slap]
[gasps]

31:18.480 --> 31:20.200
What the fuck?

31:20.830 --> 31:22.200
Friend of yours?

31:22.770 --> 31:23.920
No.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.920
It's... It's my mom.

31:26.210 --> 31:28.500
Alright. Chapman, Diaz...

31:28.500 --> 31:29.880
This is you.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.880
Uh, De Marco, this is Chapman.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.170
She's new. So surround her you show her what's what?

31:34.170 --> 31:35.140
Sure.

31:35.140 --> 31:38.980
Okay, Mendoza this is Diaz, hm? Go, go. She'll help you.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.500
Be with you in a sec. Just gotta finish here.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.500
Um... uh, I don't speak Spanish.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.140
Great, another fucking coconut.

31:46.140 --> 31:48.260
What's the matter with your mother, she don't teach you Spanish.

31:50.490 --> 31:51.640
Here you go.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.300
Here's some tissues.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.300
It's always nice to always have.

31:55.590 --> 31:57.820
And... a toothbrush.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.820
They don't give you one.

32:00.110 --> 32:02.690
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for everything.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.240
Aw. No, no, it's no problem.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.780
We look out for our own.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.900
Our own?

32:07.900 --> 32:09.960
Oh don't get all pissy on me. It's tribal.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.080
Not racist. I'll see you around.

32:13.570 --> 32:15.580
[fading footsteps]

32:18.730 --> 32:20.160
Come your name again?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.250
Piper.

32:21.930 --> 32:23.250
Chapman.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.250
That's Ms. Rossa.

32:25.890 --> 32:27.430
And that's Nichols.

32:27.430 --> 32:29.610
Just got out of SHU, a week ago.

32:29.610 --> 32:32.070
Told the CO, to kiss her ass.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.330
Dumb.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.160
Why make trouble for yourself, y'know?

32:35.160 --> 32:37.050
SHU... that's solitary?

32:37.050 --> 32:39.050
Yep. And you don't want it honey.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.200
Trust me.

32:40.380 --> 32:41.920
Here's some toilet paper.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.240
Gotta take it with you.

32:43.870 --> 32:45.010
Thanks.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.190
What's that thing?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.600
Oh. That's my machine.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.310
I need it at night.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.890
When I first got here, I had a massive heart attack.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.580
You know 'bout the count?

32:56.580 --> 32:58.190
Wait, can you go back to the heart attack?

32:58.190 --> 32:59.450
I don't like to dwell.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.510
How do I make a phone call?

33:01.510 --> 33:02.880
You need a pack number.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.230
Fill out a form, over the morrow.

33:05.570 --> 33:08.210
But maybe Caputo will let you make a call later.

33:08.610 --> 33:10.960
It helps, if you cry.
[clicks tongue]

33:13.880 --> 33:15.540
Don't make your bed!

33:15.540 --> 33:16.460
What?

33:16.460 --> 33:18.000
We'll make it for you.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.890
Oh no, that's okay. You don't need to do that.

33:19.890 --> 33:20.870
Honey.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.210
We'll... make...

33:23.210 --> 33:24.990
The... Bed.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.820
You know how?

33:26.820 --> 33:28.540
I know how to make a bed.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.660
You know how to do it so we'll pass inspection.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.210
You can help clean.

33:32.490 --> 33:35.240
We clean everything with Maxi pads.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.560
Seriously?

33:36.560 --> 33:39.250
Yep. It's a head scratcher but... that's what we got.

33:39.540 --> 33:42.510
-So we make our beds in the morning, before they count.
-No.
