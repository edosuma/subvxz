WEBVTT

00:08.095 --> 00:10.532
Help! Help me!

00:12.751 --> 00:15.058
Oh, my God, Pete.
What happened?

00:15.102 --> 00:17.104
You were the only one
I could call.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.235
Okay, stay here.
I'm gonna call 911, alright?

00:18.279 --> 00:20.629
No, no, no.
It's too late.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.848
Will you please
- just do me a favor?
- Of course.

00:22.892 --> 00:26.069
After I die, could you please
roll my ashes up

00:26.113 --> 00:27.114
into a blunt...

00:27.157 --> 00:29.333
and smoke me?

00:29.377 --> 00:32.075
Oh, you ass!
I almost had a heart attack!

00:32.119 --> 00:33.555
It's jerky.
Happy Halloween.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.992
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

00:36.036 --> 00:39.691
What?

00:39.735 --> 00:42.781
♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪

00:42.825 --> 00:45.088
There's something seriously
wrong with you.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.047
You didn't inherit
Dad's love for Halloween?

00:47.090 --> 00:48.657
That guy was
the king of pranks.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.485
He loved messing with me
all the time.

00:50.528 --> 00:51.877
Yes, my favorite prank
was when

00:51.921 --> 00:53.357
he abandoned me
at the age of 10.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.446
Wow. Very dark.
Nice.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.274
So, aside from giving me
a coronary,

00:57.318 --> 00:58.667
what are you doing
in town?

00:58.710 --> 01:01.104
Are you kidding? L.A. is lit
during Halloween season.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.845
I got five parties
lined up.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.107
You didn't bring Chastity?

01:04.151 --> 01:06.240
No. She's, uh,
stuck in Tempe.

01:06.283 --> 01:09.156
They're doing a haunted house
at the strip club.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.114
But I was wondering
if you still have

01:11.158 --> 01:13.464
that open-door policy
on your guest room?

01:13.508 --> 01:15.423
A little notice would have been
nice, but, yeah, sure.

01:15.466 --> 01:16.815
How long would you like
to stay?

01:16.859 --> 01:19.514
Oh, just a couple days.
Weeks. Months. I don't know.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.256
But I do need some clothes.
And deodorant.

01:22.299 --> 01:25.215
And a toothbrush.
Uh, I don't have anything.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.782
Of course not.
W-Why -- Why would you?

01:28.175 --> 01:30.351
Hmm. Can you grab
the blueberries?

01:33.354 --> 01:35.138
We don't have any.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.923
Wha--
I just went shopping.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.186
Hey, when you
finish something,

01:39.229 --> 01:40.752
you need to put it on
the shopping list.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.406
I didn't eat them.
I didn't.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.016
Okay. Fine.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.149
Just -- Just next time,
put it on the list.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.151
Oh, hey, did you figure out
what costume you're gonna wear

01:48.195 --> 01:49.544
to the West Hollywood parade
tonight?

01:49.587 --> 01:52.677
Um...not yet.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.984
I sent you
a ton of suggestions.

01:55.027 --> 01:58.335
No offense...
but they all sucked.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.468
Um, o-okay. Well, just because
you say "no offense"

02:00.511 --> 02:01.643
doesn't mean
it hurts less.

02:05.603 --> 02:06.952
Hello.
Hi.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.911
I'm Margaret from 604.
You're a cop, right?

02:08.954 --> 02:10.521
Yeah.
Uh, what's going on?

02:10.565 --> 02:12.349
Hey. Stop!
No, no!

02:12.393 --> 02:13.959
Those are
delicate instruments!

02:14.003 --> 02:14.699
Oh, go screw yourself!

02:14.743 --> 02:16.266
Whoa. Police.
Hey.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.876
- What's going on?
- They robbed me!

02:17.920 --> 02:19.748
Okay, <i>that</i> is not
at all true.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.489
Mrs. Crouch hired us

02:21.532 --> 02:23.839
to rid her home
of an aggressive spirit.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.449
You mean a ghost?
You guys are ghost hunters?

02:25.493 --> 02:28.670
Yeah, we are. The spirit
in Mrs. Crouch's apartment

02:28.713 --> 02:30.889
is rather just stubborn,

02:30.933 --> 02:32.761
so we said that
we would do a follow-up.

02:32.804 --> 02:36.199
For another $5,000.
She already paid them $10,000.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.941
Our prices are in line
with industry standards.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.204
You didn't get rid of my ghost!
Now, give me my money back!

02:41.248 --> 02:42.510
Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.860
Mrs. Crouch is gonna stop
trashing your stuff,

02:44.903 --> 02:46.818
and you guys are going to
give me your information

02:46.862 --> 02:49.430
so I can pass it on
to a detective.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.735
Mm-hmm.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.912
Hey,
what are you doing here?

02:53.956 --> 02:55.218
I just felt like
swinging by

02:55.262 --> 02:56.698
and seeing the best detective
in the city.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.265
You have a client
in lockup?

02:58.308 --> 02:59.657
That too.

02:59.701 --> 03:02.269
Well, don't forget to pick up
candy for tonight.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.271
And not
those variety packs

03:04.314 --> 03:06.490
with that pathetic,
fun-sized nonsense.

03:06.534 --> 03:09.841
We serve full-sized bars
at the Lopez-Evers abode.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.713
Uh, good morning.
Good morning.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.193
- Um, I need a favor.
- What's up?

03:13.236 --> 03:16.065
My neighbor is being
taken advantage of.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.981
There are these, uh,
paranormal expert,

03:19.024 --> 03:20.112
ghost hunters,
whatever.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.940
They're charging her
10 grand

03:21.984 --> 03:23.464
to rid her apartment
of ghosts.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.205
That's ridiculous.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.772
10 grand should at least get you
a quality exorcism.

03:27.816 --> 03:31.733
That said, making a case
against them could be tricky.

03:31.776 --> 03:35.171
Yeah, tarot, fortune-telling,
necromancy, ghost hunting --

03:35.215 --> 03:37.260
all the psychic arts
are legal in California.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.176
But she's an old lady
on a fixed income.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.178
There's no way
she can afford $10,000

03:42.222 --> 03:43.484
on "psychic services."

03:43.527 --> 03:45.399
Well, now, that changes
the equation.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.966
Yeah, elder financial fraud
is a crime.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.881
I'll look into it.
Thank you.
You're the best.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.319
Excuse me.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.625
Hello.
This is Lucy Chen.

03:54.669 --> 03:57.802
Um...confirming
what appointment?

03:59.021 --> 04:00.109
Excuse me?

04:00.152 --> 04:01.632
Your mother did what?

04:01.676 --> 04:03.895
She pre-paid for me
to have my eggs frozen

04:03.939 --> 04:05.723
at a fertility clinic.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.159
I thought you and your mother
weren't talking.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.900
She's definitely
talking now.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.816
Seriously, what makes her think
she has the right?

04:18.649 --> 04:20.782
Alright. Nolan...

04:22.653 --> 04:25.569
Can you tell me what today is
and what "ACH" stands for?

04:25.613 --> 04:28.833
Today is Halloween, and I have
no idea what "ACH" stands for.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.400
No candy
for partial answers.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.401
Harper?

04:31.445 --> 04:32.315
Anything can happen.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.232
Basically a reminder
to be extra careful

04:36.276 --> 04:39.540
'cause today is Halloween
and Halloween is unpredictable.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.672
Correct.
And since Officer Thorsen

04:41.716 --> 04:44.153
has range qualifications today,
you're back riding with Nolan.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.589
Oh, just like old times.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.548
Yeah, without the fear of
the whole blue-page thing.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.812
Uh, what kind of unpredictable
can we expect today?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.727
Good question, Chen.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.425
Lot of liquid courage.
Lot of 211's.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.601
Teenagers snatching
little kids' candy.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.429
Masked people running into
liquor stores.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.214
Do they have a gun, or are they
just late for a party?

05:02.258 --> 05:04.260
Muzzle discipline
is critical.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.827
And?

05:07.132 --> 05:09.439
Can you remind us how you got
your uniform torn

05:09.483 --> 05:10.832
three Halloweens ago?

05:12.790 --> 05:14.792
Uh...

05:14.836 --> 05:19.623
if you get dispatched
to a loud party,

05:19.667 --> 05:22.191
make sure they know
you're not the stripper.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.546
We'll try to get you home
on time,

05:29.590 --> 05:31.374
but it's Halloween, so...

05:31.418 --> 05:33.507
Anything can happen.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.160
Exactly.
Alright, be safe out there.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.686
This is nice,
being together again.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.558
It's actually a relief
riding with someone

05:41.602 --> 05:43.691
who can handle himself.

05:43.734 --> 05:46.215
A compliment?
How far we've come.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.173
I am in a good place.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.046
You know, work's good,
James is great.

05:51.089 --> 05:53.396
I have a wonderful relationship
with my daughter.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.965
And, I don't know, this job,
it's -- it's changed everything.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.401
Nice.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.229
Lila excited
for Halloween?

06:00.272 --> 06:02.362
Oh, beyond.
She's changed her costume

06:02.405 --> 06:04.102
like 10 times this week.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.887
And how do you
and Donovan arrange

06:05.930 --> 06:07.454
for trick-or-treating?

06:07.497 --> 06:10.021
We're supposed to alternate
years, but this morning,

06:10.065 --> 06:12.415
Lila told her father and I
that she wanted to do

06:12.459 --> 06:15.200
a family-themed costume,
like we used to wear.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.638
That sounds...
complicated?

06:17.681 --> 06:18.987
Yeah.
But, you know,

06:19.030 --> 06:20.423
she has her heart
set on it,

06:20.467 --> 06:25.080
and Donovan and I are in
a good place, so we agreed.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.342
Hmm.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.083
That's very enlightened
of you.
Thank you.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.824
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

06:29.867 --> 06:31.216
Seriously, why would you
jinx me like that?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.305
Um, I should probably
take this.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.350
Go ahead.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.830
Hey, Chastity.
How's it going?

06:35.873 --> 06:37.048
<i>Terrible.
Are -- Are you sitting down?</i>

06:37.092 --> 06:38.223
<i>It's -- It's --
It's about your brother.</i>

06:38.267 --> 06:39.921
-<i>He's missing.
- Oh, no, he's --</i>

06:39.964 --> 06:41.313
<i>He went to the store
last night,</i>

06:41.357 --> 06:43.272
<i>and he went to go get
corn nuts and Fanta,</i>

06:43.315 --> 06:45.013
<i>and -- and no one's seen him
since, and I'm just --</i>

06:45.056 --> 06:47.668
<i>I'm worried that he may have
fallen off the wagon.</i>

06:47.711 --> 06:49.409
He's -- He's on the wagon?

06:49.452 --> 06:50.888
<i>Yes, and I would have called
the Tempe Police,</i>

06:50.932 --> 06:52.237
<i>but they're still mad about
the glitter bomb and --</i>

06:52.281 --> 06:54.501
Okay, no, no, Chastity,
um, Pete's fine.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.372
He-- He's not on a bender
and he's not missing.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.635
He's here in Los Angeles.
He's with me.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.158
<i>That son of a bitch.</i>

07:00.202 --> 07:01.899
O-Okay. You want to tell me
what's going on?

07:01.943 --> 07:05.207
<i>What's going on is, I am going
to kill your little brother</i>

07:05.250 --> 07:07.383
<i>the next time I see him,
but before, I'm gonna rupture</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:09.298
<i>his delicate parts
with a pair of stilettos</i>

07:09.341 --> 07:12.170
<i>and close up all of his
openings with a hot glue gun.</i>

07:12.214 --> 07:13.911
O-Okay. You --
You do realize you--

07:13.955 --> 07:16.044
you've described about
six crimes to me, right?

07:16.087 --> 07:16.784
<i>Ugh.</i>

07:19.221 --> 07:20.352
You have to hand it to her --
she's very creative.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.266
Mm-hmm.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.226
- Happy Halloween.
- Be safe out there.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.445
Thank you.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.882
I'm just saying,
I am only 29.

07:27.925 --> 07:30.319
My eggs are nowhere near
their expiration date.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.190
But clearly, my mother thinks
that I'm a pathetic loser

07:32.234 --> 07:33.453
who's never gonna find
a partner

07:33.496 --> 07:36.238
before her fertility clock
ticks down.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.848
Or she's just looking out
for you,

07:37.892 --> 07:39.502
knowing how busy you are.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.504
Wha--
Why are you taking her side?

07:41.548 --> 07:43.071
I'm not taking her side.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.421
It's just --
It's a biological fact

07:45.465 --> 07:47.205
that you have a ticking
reproductive clock.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.903
Mm. Don't be smug about
the fact that men

07:48.946 --> 07:50.948
can have kids
well into their 90s.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.124
I'm not even 30
and apparently,

07:53.168 --> 07:55.213
I need to flash-freeze
my ovaries.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.694
It's just insurance, okay?

07:57.738 --> 08:00.741
Look, you don't get
car insurance

08:00.784 --> 08:02.394
hoping that
you crash your car.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.179
The policy is a waste
of money, alright?

08:04.222 --> 08:06.224
If your mom wants to pay
the bill, let her.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.748
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just compare

08:07.791 --> 08:09.793
my fertility
to a car wreck.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.839
I can't find my daughter.
Selina.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.449
She's dressed
like Stitch.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.060
Uh, ma'am, she's --
she's right over there.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.018
No.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.717
There were <i>two</i> kids
dressed as Stitch.

08:22.458 --> 08:26.375
Okay. A parent probably
just grabbed the wrong kid.

08:26.418 --> 08:29.596
Um, hi. My name is Tim.
What's your name?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.032
Alton.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.121
Okay, did your mom or dad
accidentally leave

08:33.164 --> 08:34.296
without you, Alton?

08:34.339 --> 08:35.471
My dad.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.603
Okay, and what's
your dad's name?

08:36.646 --> 08:37.865
Daddy.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.563
Okay, I got this.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.826
Hi. Do you know
where you live?

08:43.871 --> 08:46.830
Oh, great. You are so smart.
Where?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.049
In a house.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.573
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Okay.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.315
This is gonna take a little bit
longer than I thought.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.621
<i>You didn't tell her
I was here, did you?</i>

08:54.664 --> 08:56.971
Yes, of course I did.
She was freaking out.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.189
She thought
you'd gone missing.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.322
<i>Are you not aware
of the Bro Code?</i>

09:00.365 --> 09:02.019
<i>'Cause rule number seven
clearly states</i>

09:02.063 --> 09:04.456
<i>that when a girlfriend
asks where your bro is,</i>

09:04.500 --> 09:07.024
<i>the answer is always,
"I don't know!"</i>

09:07.068 --> 09:08.896
<i>God, you're the worst
half-brother ever!</i>

09:08.939 --> 09:10.637
I was about to say
the same thing.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.029
<i>Oh, good.
So you agree.</i>

09:13.944 --> 09:15.076
Okay.
You -- You know what?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.512
I can't -- Pete, I got to go.
I got to go.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.948
Control, 7-Adam-15.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.429
415 unknown,
Third and Gardner.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.822
People are running.
Stand by.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.040
Get out of there!

09:28.611 --> 09:30.221
Over there!

09:35.444 --> 09:39.230
Zombie!

09:39.274 --> 09:40.928
Ma'am?

09:40.971 --> 09:42.059
Ma'am, we're here to help.
What's your name?

09:44.932 --> 09:45.889
Ma'am, can you hear me?

09:54.724 --> 09:56.421
Ugh!

10:05.953 --> 10:07.041
You ready for round two?

10:07.084 --> 10:08.956
Yeah?

10:19.096 --> 10:19.836
Come on!

10:24.232 --> 10:26.713
7-Adam-15,
one in custody.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.324
On some kind of 11-3.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.065
She's having a seizure.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.075
You're the ones
who brought her in?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.338
Yeah.
She tried to eat us.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.427
Is -- Is she
having a seizure?

10:45.470 --> 10:47.081
Most likely a drug-induced
seizure.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.822
Any idea what she took?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.737
Given the super strength,
I'd say PCP,

10:50.780 --> 10:53.000
but honestly, I've never seen
anything like this before.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.698
It's got to be
some new designer drug.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.221
Ugh. I hate Halloween.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.919
I'll reach out when
the tox screen comes back.

10:58.962 --> 10:59.963
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.621
Police.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.971
Would I lie to you?
Invest now, buddy.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.538
Get in on the ground floor
and I'll make you rich.

11:09.581 --> 11:10.844
What? I'm busy.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.759
Sir, you're the prime suspect
in a kidnapping.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.327
Let me call you back.

11:16.371 --> 11:17.502
Did you just
take a child

11:17.546 --> 11:18.765
from the Mid-Wilshire
police station?

11:18.808 --> 11:20.288
Yeah.
My son, Alton.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.768
Sir, that is not
your son.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.034
Hey, Selina?

11:27.077 --> 11:29.036
Hey, could you take off
your hood, please?

11:29.079 --> 11:30.298
Hi.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.343
Holy crap.
I swear, I had no idea.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.562
Hey, are you okay?

11:33.605 --> 11:35.129
More candy.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.957
You can ask your mom.
Let's go.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.916
Noooooooo.
I want to stay here.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.963
My mom doesn't let me
eat sugar.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.797
Hello.
I'm Detective Lopez.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.450
Oh, we are picking up

11:52.494 --> 11:55.062
some very strange
readings in here.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.716
Must be the ghosts
of all the con artists

11:56.759 --> 11:58.065
I've sent to prison.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.415
10 grand to pretend
to clean an apartment

12:00.458 --> 12:02.286
full of ghosts
is a good hustle.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.461
It's not a hustle.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.812
Shh.
Just listen.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.552
Mrs. Crouch
is on a pension,

12:07.596 --> 12:10.077
and you two are draining
what's left of her future.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.382
You have two options --

12:11.426 --> 12:14.777
give her a refund,
or I'll start digging around

12:14.821 --> 12:16.866
and see if there's
a pattern of abuse.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.390
We are not
con artists.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.176
Paranormal phenomena
is real science.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.179
Now, we detected a presence
in Mrs. Crouch's home.

12:25.222 --> 12:28.138
We set up infrared thermometers
all over the apartment

12:28.182 --> 12:30.358
and recorded
a substantive drop

12:30.401 --> 12:32.099
in the ambient temperature
in the bathroom.

12:32.142 --> 12:34.928
A temperature drop which <i>is
evidence of a spectral presence.</i>

12:34.971 --> 12:36.538
Or a draft.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.062
And our UV camera
picked up this.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.204
There. <i>That</i> is the spirit
we were trying to clear

12:50.247 --> 12:51.466
from Mrs. Crouch's home.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.816
That's a digital glitch
or your own shadow.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.339
Spoken like
a true innocent.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.080
You have to understand
that before it was

12:57.124 --> 13:00.431
some marketing gimmick
to sell candy and costumes,

13:00.475 --> 13:03.739
Halloween was <i>the</i> sacred day
when the veil between

13:03.783 --> 13:08.091
our world and the next parted
and the spirits moved freely.

13:08.135 --> 13:09.963
You misunderstand.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.139
I'm not saying I don't believe
in evil spirits.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.445
I'm saying
I don't believe in <i>you.</i>

13:14.489 --> 13:16.578
Detective...

13:16.621 --> 13:18.667
Mrs. Crouch
is in real danger.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.712
And we need to get back there
to finish the cleanse.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.192
Not happening.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.151
I gave you a chance
to do the right thing.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.936
You want to do this
the hard way, we'll
do this the hard way.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.242
This will be quick.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.765
As long as I get that free lunch
you promised me,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.201
I am good.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.638
Everything's in the fridge.
Help yourself.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.466
Hey.
I love this shirt.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.468
It makes me look like
a lumberjack.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.774
Hey, I know you.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.993
Nice to see you again.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.039
What's with
the lecture face?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.954
This isn't lecture face.
I don't have lecture face.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.652
That is 100%
a lecture face.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.654
I'm-a make a sandwich.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.612
Pete, what's going on
with Chastity?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.222
Why are you really here?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.310
So she didn't tell you?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.269
No, she hung up on me.
She's pissed.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.967
Well, that's because
she's

13:58.011 --> 13:59.403
I'm sorry, she's what?

13:59.447 --> 14:01.101
Pren-- She's nent.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.537
- She's fragrant?
- She's pregnant.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.060
What?! Pete!

14:04.104 --> 14:06.584
So, you -- you walk out
on her and let her believe

14:06.628 --> 14:08.282
you've gone missing?

14:08.325 --> 14:10.632
What are you --Oh, so I freaked out.
Relax, okay?

14:10.675 --> 14:12.416
What -- What exactly
about this makes you think

14:12.460 --> 14:14.070
that I'll be a good dad,
okay?

14:14.114 --> 14:16.768
I-I-I don't floss.
I've never had a vegetable.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.162
I-I have the IQ
of a hummingbird,

14:19.206 --> 14:21.556
which I'm told they're
the stupidest of the birds.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.993
The biggest favor
I can do for this kid
is to just walk away.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.908
You can't be serious.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.345
You have a kid, right?
W-Would you let me babysit?

14:28.389 --> 14:31.261
Uh, I'd be more likely
to put her in charge of you.

14:31.305 --> 14:35.222
- See?
- So you're gonna do to your baby
what our dad did to me?

14:35.265 --> 14:38.268
Yeah, I know Dad left you,
but he stayed for me,

14:38.312 --> 14:39.879
and look how that turned out,
alright?

14:39.922 --> 14:42.055
I just know if
I stick around,

14:42.098 --> 14:43.621
I'm just gonna
screw it up.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.233
Sorry to interrupt, but our
zombie suspect is conscious.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.452
Sorry,
did you say "zombie"?

14:48.496 --> 14:49.758
We'll finish this later.

14:49.801 --> 14:52.021
And a hummingbird is
a proud and noble animal.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.982
That poor kid.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.548
Imagine having that idiot
as your father.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.072
Guy was just clueless.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.813
There are a lot worse
out there. Trust me.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.991
I'm living proof that some
people should not be parents.

15:07.645 --> 15:08.951
You think
you'll ever have kids?

15:11.519 --> 15:14.000
Uh, honestly?

15:14.043 --> 15:16.263
I, uh, thought I would've
had some by now.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.265
Isabel and I,
we made all these plans --

15:18.308 --> 15:20.876
pop out three kids,
watch them grow up,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.312
have kids of their own.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.531
But...

15:23.574 --> 15:25.446
Things don't always
work out.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.449
Which is why you think I should
make contingency plans.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.276
Watch out!

15:31.626 --> 15:33.715
Control, 7-Adam-100!
Possible 51-50!

15:33.758 --> 15:35.108
Olympic at Citrus.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.937
Male, 30s,
is now attacking my shop.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.939
Get an additional unit
and an RA. Code 3.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.508
Uh, Amber, hi.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.555
I'm, uh, Nyla.
This is John.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.514
What drug did you take?
Amber?

15:50.558 --> 15:53.430
She was speaking earlier --
random words here and there.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.693
It's clear that whatever
this drug is,

15:55.737 --> 15:58.435
it has had a catastrophic effect
on her nervous system.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.525
The damage to her brain
might be irreparable.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.092
We should check back
with the tech guys,

16:03.136 --> 16:04.876
see if they had any luck
opening Amber's phone.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.574
We need to track down
her dealer.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.622
Biter?
Yes.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.754
We had one, too.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.930
- They ID the drug yet?
No.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.410
Guys, honestly,
have you ever seen

16:16.453 --> 16:18.542
anything like
this before?

16:22.024 --> 16:24.070
- You all okay?
- Nothing broken,
nothing bleeding.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.506
Yeah,
but plenty is sore.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.422
The Intel Unit says
this new drug is called Bomb-X,

16:28.465 --> 16:30.946
and it's being sold on something
called ClipTalk.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.340
That's a new
social media app.

16:33.383 --> 16:36.038
Once we figure out which
hashtags are trending,

16:36.082 --> 16:37.474
we'll be able to whittle it down
to our dealer.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.476
Until then,
we're just playing catch-up,

16:39.520 --> 16:41.043
and a lot of innocent people
are getting hurt.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
What do you
want us to do, Sarge?

16:42.479 --> 16:44.351
Nothing.
I called in extra personnel

16:44.394 --> 16:45.395
for the midnight shift.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.049
I'm going
to brief them now.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.138
You're all end of watch.

16:50.618 --> 16:53.490
- And what are you doing?
- Stay with you.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.058
Sergeant Reeves is covering two
districts on this crazy night.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.320
The least I can do
is help.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.843
Thanks.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.584
It was all a big
misunderstanding.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.760
No. The Edwards
took advantage of you.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.502
Uh, no, darling.
I was wrong.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.504
My ghost hasn't
made a peep in hours.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.289
All that tinkering
they did worked.

17:09.332 --> 17:12.161
Or they could have <i>caused
the paranormal activity,</i>

17:12.205 --> 17:15.034
in which case, they also
could have made it stop.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.253
Sometimes,
people prey on seniors.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.647
You know what they do
even more often?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.605
Underestimate us.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.216
I'm not an idiot.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.088
No, ma'am. I didn't mean
to suggest that you were.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.003
As soon as strange things
started happening,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.091
I did my research.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.353
Let me tell you,

17:30.397 --> 17:33.052
there's no way this building
isn't...haunted.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.229
Dare I ask
what you're in for?

17:36.272 --> 17:37.404
Hi.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.840
Pete.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.189
I hate you.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.451
Okay.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.192
Yeah, you make me think.
I don't like thinking.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.759
Yeah, well, thinking sucks,
but sometimes,

17:44.802 --> 17:46.674
that's the price you pay
for being an adult.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.633
Yeah, well, you know, I'm not
gonna ghost Chastity, okay?

17:49.677 --> 17:53.246
If she wants to have a baby,
then I'll man up, you know,

17:53.289 --> 17:54.682
I'll take care
of my family,

17:54.725 --> 17:55.639
but I-I don't know
what I'm doing.

17:55.683 --> 17:56.988
I don't have any skills.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.294
Start with what you know.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.209
Yeah, but all I know how
to do is, you know, gamble

18:00.253 --> 18:01.471
and, like, do drugs,

18:01.515 --> 18:02.994
and, you know,
I don't even do that anymore.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.779
Well, let's start with that.
Okay, gambling.

18:04.822 --> 18:07.347
Um, you, uh --
you need patience,

18:07.390 --> 18:10.959
uh, strategic thinking, uh,

18:11.002 --> 18:13.004
uh, optimism,
being able to read people.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.310
Your knowledge
of the drug trade.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.530
You could...

18:16.573 --> 18:17.966
Uh, you...

18:18.009 --> 18:19.533
You.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.056
You could help us.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.840
Hey, do you know anything
about buying drugs

18:22.884 --> 18:24.277
through ClipTalk?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.888
Yeah.
Only, like, everything.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.890
Really?
Yeah. You, uh --

18:28.933 --> 18:30.283
You want me to help you
get drugs?

18:30.326 --> 18:32.198
I --
I don't think
I could do that.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.069
I don't think NA would be
too proud of that.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.723
I -- It's not for me,
and I would never do anything

18:35.766 --> 18:39.118
to endanger your sobriety.
I just --

18:39.161 --> 18:42.033
If you could give us
any insight on Bomb-X,

18:42.077 --> 18:43.818
you could help
a lot of people, Pete.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.602
Alright.
Check this out.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.648
It's actually pretty easy
to do.

18:47.691 --> 18:48.997
So you just go on here,

18:49.040 --> 18:52.870
and his name
is Flamebroiled6060,

18:52.914 --> 18:55.482
which is street slang
for getting lit.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.570
Pete.
Yeah?

18:56.613 --> 18:58.180
How'd you like to make
500 bucks?

18:58.224 --> 18:59.529
- Can I hold your gun?
- No.

18:59.573 --> 19:00.487
Please?
Come on.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.836
You never let me
hold the gun.

19:01.879 --> 19:04.273
I think your building
is haunted.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.666
I did some research,

19:05.709 --> 19:08.408
and while our ghost busters
may be frauds,

19:08.451 --> 19:11.062
this place is destined to be
a Netflix documentary.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.238
What happened?

19:12.281 --> 19:14.109
In 1912, the building
was constructed

19:14.153 --> 19:16.198
as a textile factory.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.897
A year later, seven workers
died in a fire.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.726
1927, a speakeasy opens
in the basement.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.728
It closes within the year.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.209
Employees kept quitting,
driven out by the sounds

19:27.253 --> 19:29.864
of people screaming
as they died.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.387
That's awful.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.215
The building shuts down during
the Depression,

19:33.259 --> 19:35.391
doesn't open again
until the '60s,

19:35.435 --> 19:38.220
when a charming,
young musician

19:38.264 --> 19:40.875
decides to use it
for his recording studio.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.703
Brian Wilson?

19:42.746 --> 19:44.095
- Charles Manson.
- Mnh.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.272
In the aughts, the building
was purchased

19:46.315 --> 19:49.666
and converted into
the hipster catnip apartments

19:49.710 --> 19:51.102
we see before us.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.801
A worker goes missing
during construction.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.020
A week later, he's found
in one of the walls,

19:56.064 --> 19:57.457
surrounded by
scratch marks,

19:57.500 --> 20:00.677
as if he tried to
claw his way out.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.592
Okay. Let's move.
I know an underpass

20:02.636 --> 20:04.072
that stays pretty warm
this time of year.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.856
No, we are not moving.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.642
Look, this is all creepy
and just not great,

20:08.685 --> 20:11.514
but ghosts aren't real.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.951
The only real problem
are the con artists

20:13.995 --> 20:15.910
that are preying on
Mrs. Crouch.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.695
She's the one who pointed me
to the building's history.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.785
And unfortunately,
she doesn't want our help.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.745
But elder fraud goes way down
when a trusted friend

20:24.788 --> 20:27.748
or a family member
or nosy neighbor...

20:27.791 --> 20:29.402
Well......takes an interest.

20:29.445 --> 20:33.493
So I'm 99% certain our
ghost hunters won't be back.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.888
Man. I hope I have a neighbor
as caring as me

20:37.932 --> 20:39.238
when I'm old and alone.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.804
Rough week
on the dating market?

20:40.848 --> 20:42.589
It is so much worse
than that.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.113
My mother has literally paid

20:45.156 --> 20:47.420
to have my eggs
harvested and frozen.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.988
I wouldn't laugh
if I were you.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.860
Life sneaks up on you fast,

20:52.903 --> 20:54.731
Miss I-just-went-through-puberty.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.168
Hey, if she wants to pay
for it, why not?

20:57.212 --> 20:58.996
Egg freezing costs
thousands of dollars.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.476
Now you can do it
for free.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.783
The real cost
is my peace of mind

21:02.826 --> 21:04.088
every time my mother asks me

21:04.132 --> 21:05.699
when I'm gonna take
her grandkids

21:05.742 --> 21:07.266
out of the deep freeze.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.529
So then don't freeze your eggs
and just adopt.

21:09.572 --> 21:12.140
It's not like there's
a shortage of kids out
there who need it.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.795
Well, I got to get home
for Jack's first Halloween.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.710
Call me if you need
recommendations for movers.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.102
We're not moving.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.365
Uh-huh.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.457
Oh, hey, look,
it's Mom.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.503
You're late.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.157
Well, given that
I was just informed

21:29.200 --> 21:32.116
about our family-themed
costume today,

21:32.160 --> 21:34.554
I think I deserve
a little credit.

21:34.597 --> 21:37.034
- Okay.
- But you look super cute,
baby girl.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.601
Thanks.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.475
You make a great
Rey Skywalker.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.954
Oh. Are you just
saying that

21:43.998 --> 21:45.391
because I am
a real-life badass,

21:45.434 --> 21:48.524
or because I look good
holding a lightsaber?

21:48.568 --> 21:49.743
Uh, both?

21:49.786 --> 21:51.658
Hmm, that was
a good answer.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.442
Hmm, okay.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.922
Thanks for coming,
though.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.490
And for wearing
the whole costume.

21:57.533 --> 21:58.882
It really means a lot
to her.

21:58.926 --> 22:01.407
Well, thanks for the invite.
It means a lot to me.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.582
Nyla, is that you?

22:02.625 --> 22:04.279
Mrs. Dolinsky.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.847
So great to see you two
back together again.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.283
I never liked
that Penelope.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.981
Uh, I'm still dating
Penelope.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.896
Yeah, we're --
we're not back together.

22:12.940 --> 22:17.379
We are just reunited to fight
for the Rebel Alliance.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.076
Happy Halloween.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.687
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.385
This is gonna be
a long night, huh?

22:23.429 --> 22:24.604
Yep.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.171
Hey, thanks for
coming with me.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.564
I know it's not really
your thing,

22:28.608 --> 22:30.610
and I really appreciate
the company.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.047
I promised myself
I'd try new things.

22:33.090 --> 22:36.006
Or old things, I guess.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.660
You couldn't have picked,
you know,

22:37.704 --> 22:39.009
costumes from <i>
this</i> century?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.055
Well, you know,
Bonnie and Clyde are not old,

22:41.098 --> 22:43.100
they are iconic.
Mm.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.411
Gosh, why is it
always so cold
in this bathroom?

22:49.455 --> 22:51.195
'Cause like 20 people
died in here.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.675
Oh, my gosh.
Don't even --

22:56.462 --> 22:57.593
What --

23:05.819 --> 23:07.124
Oh.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.866
That's why it's always
so cold in here.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.260
Give me a hand.

23:18.353 --> 23:21.704
Whoa, uh, that's...
creepy.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.881
You heard the history.

23:24.925 --> 23:29.103
This building has been
repurposed and subdivided

23:29.146 --> 23:30.452
so many times,

23:30.496 --> 23:32.062
I bet there are little
nooks and crannies

23:32.106 --> 23:34.108
all over the place.

23:34.151 --> 23:37.067
Okay. You stay here.
I will be right back.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.547
Yeah, like I'm
really gonna let you

23:38.591 --> 23:40.549
just climb through the gates
of hell by yourself.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.377
Have you ever seen
a horror movie?

23:42.421 --> 23:43.857
Fine.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.162
You can come.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.773
Yes!

23:49.340 --> 23:51.342
Okay.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.257
Okay, stay close.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.305
Oof.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.530
Oof.

24:06.706 --> 24:07.881
Watch your step.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.371
- Someone's been back here.
- Mm-hmm.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.681
Uh-oh.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.918
Now do you believe I didn't
eat all the blueberries?

24:46.397 --> 24:48.443
The ghost who's been living
in our walls did.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.494
So Pete set up a controlled buy
with the Bomb-X dealer.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.712
And you know your way
around ClipTalk?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.322
Oh, yeah. I used to use it
to get ketamine

24:58.366 --> 24:59.976
and Molly
and shrooms and --

25:00.020 --> 25:02.065
Something you might
not want to admit in
a room full of cops.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.764
Uh, I mean alle--
allegedly did...that.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.592
Anyway, who's gonna
actually buy the drugs,

25:06.635 --> 25:08.158
like, in real life?

25:08.202 --> 25:11.118
No offense, but you fit
the profile.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.946
Yeah. Totally.
I get that.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.774
I just -- Uh, the thing is,
I don't really want to be,

25:14.817 --> 25:16.166
like, touching the drugs,

25:16.210 --> 25:17.603
because once I get
my hands on it,

25:17.646 --> 25:19.126
I don't think I could trust
myself around it,

25:19.169 --> 25:21.607
'cause I don't really have
great self-restraint.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.391
We'll have eyes on you
the whole time, alright?

25:23.434 --> 25:26.002
You'll never have a chance
to use the drugs. I promise.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.744
If you're uncomfortable
for any reason,

25:28.788 --> 25:30.790
we'll find another way.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.531
No, no.
I-I got it.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.794
And you'll -- you'll be
looking out for me, right?

25:34.837 --> 25:36.796
I'll be looking out
for you.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.232
Thanks for stepping in.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.147
And good luck.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.064
Alright. So you're
gonna get wired up

25:44.107 --> 25:45.587
and go in, take the cash
that we give you,

25:45.631 --> 25:46.719
and buy the Bomb-X.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.459
Here's the important part --

25:48.503 --> 25:50.331
- Clean him out.
- Buy everything.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.680
That way, he has to go back
to his supplier.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.029
Okay, and then <i>
we</i> follow him.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.553
That's when <i>
we</i> follow him.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.685
At that point, you are done.
One more thing.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.600
You have to be
strip-searched. Twice.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.603
Uh, before and after.
In front of two witnesses.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.344
You cops really do like it
freaky, huh?

26:03.387 --> 26:05.346
It's so the dealer's defense
team can't claim later

26:05.389 --> 26:07.391
that you had drugs on you
before you made the buy.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.132
Alright.
Let's get this over with.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.743
Might as well start
with the holes.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.005
Pete, Pete, Pete,
- Pete, Pete!
- Yeah?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.006
Not here.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.616
What the --?

26:14.660 --> 26:15.617
No?
Not here.
Not here.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.010
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm sorry.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.839
Happy Halloween.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.456
She's out.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.458
She did hit a record number
of houses this year.

26:32.199 --> 26:33.592
Is she okay under there?

26:33.635 --> 26:36.116
Uh, I asked her if she wanted
to take it off, but, uh,

26:36.159 --> 26:38.118
she threatened me
with bodily injury.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.815
Freshen you up?

26:39.859 --> 26:41.774
Yeah. Sure.
Why not?

26:43.384 --> 26:45.038
Oh.

26:46.430 --> 26:51.522
I am not used to walking miles
in $6 pleather boots.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.091
Maybe next year, we can steer
her towards a family

26:55.135 --> 26:56.876
that wears
comfy track suits.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.661
Mm.
Like "The Royal Tenenbaums"?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.402
Exactly.

27:01.445 --> 27:02.577
We used to love that film.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.361
Yeah.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.801
You know, I'm sorry
it got awkward today

27:08.844 --> 27:11.194
with people thinking
that we were back together.

27:11.238 --> 27:15.024
But seeing her so happy
made it worth it.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.289
Look, I know that we're
supposed to split holidays,

27:19.333 --> 27:22.249
but she's just growing up
so fast,

27:22.292 --> 27:25.948
and I hate the idea of missing
any more time with her.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.950
I know what you mean.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.953
Maybe we can
come up with, um...

27:30.997 --> 27:32.868
a new schedule.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.783
Something a bit more fluid.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.829
I'd like that.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.483
To us...
and being more...

27:39.527 --> 27:40.789
fluid.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.706
So it's not a ghost.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.969
There is someone
living in our walls.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.014
Happy Halloween.

27:48.057 --> 27:50.494
I'm getting major
stalker vibes.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.887
Mm.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.544
Oh.

27:56.587 --> 27:59.590
Yeah.
For Margaret Ward, 604.

28:01.505 --> 28:02.681
What was that?

28:02.724 --> 28:04.378
Um, I don't know.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.641
I hope it was
the pipes, though.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.471
Okay, um, we're gonna
go check it out.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.385
I'll call it in.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.345
Okay.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.526
Watch your head.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.018
Peepholes.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.019
Eww.

28:37.063 --> 28:37.890
Yeah.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.721
Look, Margaret's doing
laundry on Halloween?

28:42.764 --> 28:44.418
We should invite her
to go out with us.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.550
Yeah, right after we warn her
she's being creeped

28:46.594 --> 28:48.030
by a stalker.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.649
Margaret!

29:01.652 --> 29:03.089
Margaret!
Look out!

29:03.132 --> 29:04.960
We need
to get in there.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.745
There has to be
a door or hatch.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.311
He got in there somehow.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.580
You stay here.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.423
Hey! Police!
Drop the weapon!

29:36.557 --> 29:37.776
No, no, no, no.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.169
Come on.
Come on.

29:50.353 --> 29:53.356
Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes!

29:53.400 --> 29:54.357
Thank you.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.968
Yes, yes!

30:00.624 --> 30:02.278
This is
Sergeant Tim Bradford.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.497
Today's date
is October 31st.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.586
We're conducting
a "Buy-Walk" operation,

30:05.629 --> 30:08.676
using CI number 081316.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.896
Tonight's buy
targets a narcotic

30:10.939 --> 30:12.985
with the street name
of Bomb-X.

30:13.028 --> 30:16.466
After the buy, we will tail
the suspect to his SOS.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.773
<i>You guys, uh -- You guys
still hear me over there?</i>

30:18.817 --> 30:20.514
You bet, Pete.
We can still hear you.

30:20.557 --> 30:23.996
Alright.
I'm, uh -- I'm going in.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.697
Hello?

30:29.740 --> 30:32.526
Do those burgers
come flamebroiled?

30:32.569 --> 30:35.224
- I know you?
- Yeah, we, uh --
we texted a few times.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.009
You "eggplant emoji 70"?

30:37.052 --> 30:40.577
Yeah. Uh, "eggplant emoji 69"
was already taken.

30:40.621 --> 30:43.493
Okay. Let me see it.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.582
Put the money
in the car.

30:45.626 --> 30:47.541
I'll tell you where it is.
Six pack, right?

30:47.584 --> 30:49.804
Yeah, well, what started
as a small get-together

30:49.848 --> 30:51.327
has now turned into
a bigger party.

30:51.371 --> 30:53.895
Like, "boat" big,
if you know what I'm saying.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.941
You want a boat?
A full boat?

30:55.984 --> 30:57.246
I don't have that much
on me.

30:57.290 --> 30:58.465
Well, how much do you have?

31:00.815 --> 31:04.036
I got 80 left.
That's four grand.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.081
You got that kind of cash?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.259
How fast
can you get the rest?

31:14.568 --> 31:15.525
That was awesome!

31:15.569 --> 31:17.005
- You did great!
- Yeah.

31:18.702 --> 31:19.878
The -- The drugs?

31:20.966 --> 31:22.402
Right.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.973
Just looks like
a super-fun time.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.844
Yeah. A fun time that
turns you into a zombie

31:29.888 --> 31:30.932
and melts your brain.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.629
Right. Yeah.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.066
Got to say, not bad.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.548
Air Three has the dealer on
the 10 East towards downtown.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.159
- We got to go.
- Right.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.770
Listen, Pete, um...
great job.

31:42.813 --> 31:43.902
I'm really proud of you.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.816
Thank you.
Can I have the money now?

31:45.860 --> 31:48.123
I'm serious.
It took guts to do what you did.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.211
No, I know.
I'm serious, too.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.647
Could I please have
the money now?

31:50.691 --> 31:52.345
Okay, Officer Jan will drive you
back to the station.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.477
They'll strip search you again,
make sure you didn't keep any,

31:54.521 --> 31:55.739
and they'll pay you.

31:55.783 --> 31:58.133
Great. Normally I'd say,
"Lucky you,"

31:58.177 --> 31:59.308
but I was sweating balls
out there.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.875
Okay.
Let's go.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.409
Control, 7-Adam-100.

32:13.453 --> 32:16.238
Suspect just stopped outside
the Los Angeles Theater.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.197
What's the ETA on Metro?

32:18.240 --> 32:21.635
<i>7-Adam-100, Metro
landing in 15 minutes.</i>

32:21.678 --> 32:23.376
This is ridiculous.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.030
We're in the middle of an op
and there's no backup?

32:25.073 --> 32:27.162
It's Halloween.

32:27.206 --> 32:28.424
Alright,
so what do we do?

32:28.468 --> 32:31.688
Do we go after him
or wait for backup?

32:31.732 --> 32:33.995
We go after him.
There's other exits
on that building.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.475
We can't chance him
getting resupplied

32:35.518 --> 32:36.780
and those drugs
hitting the streets.

32:36.824 --> 32:37.694
Right answer.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.467
Ready?

34:31.112 --> 34:33.201
Police!
Stay right where you are!

34:33.245 --> 34:35.029
Show me your hands!
Now!

34:35.073 --> 34:37.640
Turn around!
Turn around!

34:37.684 --> 34:39.947
Interlock your fingers
behind your head.

34:44.430 --> 34:45.996
Sit down.

34:47.476 --> 34:48.521
Sit down.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.122
You okay?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.341
Ask me later.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.345
Control, we need an RA
to our location.

36:13.388 --> 36:14.737
Three suspects in custody.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.661
Mm.

36:27.446 --> 36:28.229
Mm.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.497
- Oh, my God.
- Ah.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.717
How much did we drink
last night?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.153
I don't remember.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.807
Mm. So too much.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.591
Daddy?

36:42.635 --> 36:45.333
Don't -- Don't come in.
Uh, I'm getting dressed.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.335
Can I have pancakes
for breakfast?

36:47.379 --> 36:48.423
And syrup?

36:48.467 --> 36:50.251
And can I have some more
of my candy?

36:50.295 --> 36:52.558
Whatever you want,
sweetheart.

36:57.258 --> 36:59.521
I-I-I-I don't want to
confuse her.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.916
- Yeah.
- Or get her hopes up
that we are back together.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.657
No.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.093
So what do we do?

37:06.136 --> 37:09.183
Uh, you -- you go make
her pancakes.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.534
I will do what
any mature single parent does

37:12.578 --> 37:14.406
and hide in the closet.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.365
Did you get any sleep?

37:17.409 --> 37:20.238
Considering we went to bed
an hour ago, no.

37:21.587 --> 37:24.372
Look, last night was something
out of a nightmare,

37:24.416 --> 37:27.114
and if you're not feeling safe
being here right now,

37:27.157 --> 37:29.508
we can get a hotel
or something.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.424
I've slept in a lot
of creepy places.

37:32.467 --> 37:35.296
Never had a badass superhero
protecting me,

37:35.340 --> 37:37.385
so this is the safest
I've ever felt.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.952
Aww.

37:41.302 --> 37:41.998
Oh.

37:42.042 --> 37:42.999
Hey!

37:43.043 --> 37:44.523
Hey.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.960
I just wanted to let you know
that if you hear any noises,

37:47.003 --> 37:50.529
it's TID processing the scene,
not ghosts.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.532
Yes. Because ghosts
do not exist.

37:53.575 --> 37:56.012
Agree to disagree.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.450
So, uh, did you decide what
to do about your eggs?

37:58.493 --> 38:02.715
Uh, I-I'm gonna make an
appointment for a consultation.

38:02.758 --> 38:03.672
And then we'll see.

38:03.716 --> 38:05.283
Sounds like a solid plan.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.241
And the fact that babies
are crying machines

38:07.285 --> 38:09.025
who never sleep for more
than three hours in a row

38:09.069 --> 38:11.767
and you can't tell whether
they're smiling or have gas

38:11.811 --> 38:15.031
and every time you change
their diaper, they pee on you.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.686
Don't let any of that
dissuade you

38:17.730 --> 38:19.558
from the joys of motherhood,
okay?

38:19.601 --> 38:22.604
Well, when you put it that way,
I mean, I...

38:22.648 --> 38:23.475
I can't wait.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.737
Me either.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.565
Kidding.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.654
I don't want to have a kid for
at least, like, another year.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.614
Again, kidding.
God, you're so easy.

38:32.658 --> 38:36.226
Seriously, though, Jack is
the best thing in my life.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.359
And I wish the same for you,
whenever you're ready.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.361
Thanks.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.971
I know you were just kidding,
but, um,

38:42.015 --> 38:44.278
we should probably talk about
birth control, and --

38:44.322 --> 38:47.412
and -- and --
and just general sex education

38:47.455 --> 38:48.500
would be good.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.371
I'd rather be
possessed.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.764
Take it back.

38:51.807 --> 38:52.721
It was a joke.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.201
Take it back.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.029
Fine.
I-I take it back.

38:57.465 --> 38:58.988
Thank God.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.036
I fed her pancakes,
candy bars, and soda.

39:03.079 --> 39:05.430
I'm a terrible father, but she
won't be coming in here.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.867
Thank you for the shirt.
I will get it back to you later.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.695
Of course.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.046
I bought a ring.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.311
- Excuse me?
- An engagement ring.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.792
Donovan, last night
was fun and all,

39:19.835 --> 39:21.489
but we really shouldn't --

39:21.533 --> 39:24.013
For Penelope.

39:24.057 --> 39:27.365
I was...
planning to propose.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.629
And you still should.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.848
I mean, Penelope is great,

39:32.892 --> 39:35.373
despite what
Mrs. Dolinsky thinks.

39:35.416 --> 39:38.071
And she is really sweet
with Lila.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.420
What about last night?

39:39.464 --> 39:43.250
We fell into
a comfortable routine.

39:43.293 --> 39:46.471
And now we both
have to move on.

39:46.514 --> 39:51.040
Hey, look, we messed up, but
that will never happen again,

39:51.084 --> 39:53.695
which means it's in the past,

39:53.739 --> 39:56.872
so let's not let it blow
up our futures, okay?

39:56.916 --> 39:58.657
Yeah. Okay.

40:00.702 --> 40:03.357
So...

40:03.401 --> 40:04.924
you...

40:04.967 --> 40:06.404
you're going out
the window?

40:06.447 --> 40:07.535
Yeah.

40:12.192 --> 40:14.455
Well, I am all packed.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.328
You didn't even bring
a toothbrush.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.418
Are you just taking
a bunch of my clothes?

40:20.461 --> 40:21.419
No.

40:23.246 --> 40:26.902
Hey, man, uh,
thanks for, like, uh,

40:26.946 --> 40:28.643
you know, all your help
in making me a CI.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.253
That was really cool.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.907
I didn't know you could make
money buying drugs.

40:31.951 --> 40:33.474
Yeah, yeah.
Even so,

40:33.518 --> 40:36.390
I might skip listing that
under "skills" on your résumé.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.871
Hey, uh, not to get
all sappy and crap,

40:38.914 --> 40:41.482
but, uh,
thanks for believing in me.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.442
Uh, I kinda believe in myself
now a little bit,

40:44.485 --> 40:47.357
and I've decided I'm gonna be
a responsible adult

40:47.401 --> 40:51.100
and go back to Tempe
and fix things up with Chastity.

40:51.144 --> 40:53.451
And I'll be the dad
that, you know,

40:53.494 --> 40:54.669
our dad could never be.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.149
Pete, I have no doubt.

41:00.501 --> 41:01.546
I see you!

41:01.589 --> 41:03.286
I'll get that.

41:03.330 --> 41:07.334
♪ We're wild and free

41:07.377 --> 41:09.205
Thank you.
There he is.

41:09.249 --> 41:10.772
Pete, listen to me --

41:10.816 --> 41:12.861
Hey.
Just hear me out, okay?

41:12.905 --> 41:14.515
I have a whole speech
prepared,

41:14.559 --> 41:15.908
and it's not gonna
be that great,

41:15.951 --> 41:17.213
so please don't get mad,

41:17.257 --> 41:18.911
but I-I don't have
a lot to offer.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.608
But you already know that
because you know me.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.044
Pete --
No.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.524
Please --
Please just
let me finish.

41:23.568 --> 41:24.656
Okay.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.789
Chastity Evelyn Sneed,

41:27.833 --> 41:29.487
I want to be
your baby daddy.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.097
I do.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.013
I want to be the best dad
that I can be for our child.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.188
So will you please --

41:35.231 --> 41:37.669
Stop talking.

41:39.322 --> 41:40.367
I'm not pregnant.

41:40.410 --> 41:41.890
Wait, what? Seriously?

41:41.934 --> 41:43.544
Seriously.

41:43.588 --> 41:47.548
Yes! Oh, my God!
That is fantastic news.

41:47.592 --> 41:50.116
Whew.
Wait, I'm actually --

41:50.159 --> 41:51.683
I might be a little sad.

41:53.728 --> 41:56.601
Nah. Not even a little.
I feel great!

41:56.644 --> 41:57.863
We should celebrate.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.168
You want to go to Vegas
or something?
Yes!

41:59.212 --> 42:00.474
I'm -- I'm sorry.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.345
Pete,
you just finished saying

42:02.389 --> 42:04.260
you wanted to start being
a responsible adult.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.914
Yes. Yes.
That was New Pete.

42:05.958 --> 42:06.915
But I'm Old Pete.

42:06.959 --> 42:08.264
Old Pete is back

42:08.308 --> 42:10.223
'cause new Pete
is no longer required.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.660
And Old Pete
wants to go to Vegas

42:12.704 --> 42:14.227
and go to a strip club
and make it rain.

42:14.270 --> 42:15.663
What do you think?
Should we go?
Yeah.

42:15.707 --> 42:16.925
Cool.

42:16.969 --> 42:18.884
Bye, John.

42:18.927 --> 42:20.929
- Good luck, Chastity.
- Thanks!

42:20.973 --> 42:22.148
Later, nerd.
Thanks for having me.

42:22.191 --> 42:24.280
- I'll see you soon.
- Maybe no rush on that.

42:24.324 --> 42:25.673
No, I-I will be back.

42:25.717 --> 42:27.545
Call first?
Nope!
