WEBVTT

00:01.423 --> 00:03.324
I have a bit of an
announcement to make!

00:03.392 --> 00:06.660
My blog is going to be published
as a book.

00:06.728 --> 00:07.895
That's great, Lou.

00:07.929 --> 00:09.329
<i>Send us your favourite entries</i>

00:09.364 --> 00:10.697
and I'll get them
to my publisher.

00:10.766 --> 00:12.332
<i>And if you could do that</i>
<i>sooner rather than later,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.567
that'd be great,

00:13.635 --> 00:14.802
because we're already organizing
a book tour.

00:14.870 --> 00:17.838
A... a book tour?!
Okay!

00:17.906 --> 00:19.173
Goodbye!

00:19.207 --> 00:21.608
Not goodbye.

00:21.643 --> 00:25.512
Just... till next time.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.281
Okay, till next time.

00:32.987 --> 00:34.588
It's okay, Spartan.
It's okay, it's okay!

00:34.622 --> 00:35.989
It's just a thunderstorm.

00:36.056 --> 00:37.456
You're fine, you're fine!

00:37.524 --> 00:38.992
I know, I'm right here.

00:39.059 --> 00:41.560
I'm right here.
Good boy!

00:41.628 --> 00:43.562
Amy, take care of this guy!

00:43.630 --> 00:45.165
Sure. How are the other horses?

00:45.232 --> 00:47.466
Well, it's not
their first storm,

00:47.534 --> 00:49.635
but this one's
a little spooked!

00:49.670 --> 00:51.104
<i>Easy...</i>

00:51.172 --> 00:52.438
Nothing's gonna hurt you!

00:53.940 --> 00:56.642
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>That was close!</i>

00:56.710 --> 00:58.744
Yeah, too close!

01:00.180 --> 01:01.580
I got him.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:23.769 --> 01:24.970
Hey.

01:25.038 --> 01:28.239
I heard Katie
crying and I thought...

01:28.273 --> 01:30.442
if she needs someone
to stay with,

01:30.476 --> 01:33.077
um... I could stay
down here.

01:33.145 --> 01:35.780
Sure, honey, yeah.
I think that's a great idea.

01:35.848 --> 01:37.148
She's actually pretty scared,

01:37.216 --> 01:39.417
and she could really use her
big sister right about now.

01:40.653 --> 01:42.387
Hear that, Katie?

01:42.455 --> 01:44.155
You want me to stay with you?

01:44.223 --> 01:46.423
Can you do me a favour
and look for Pogie in there?

01:46.458 --> 01:47.791
Uh, yeah.

01:48.894 --> 01:50.962
<i>Let's find Pogie, okay?</i>

01:50.996 --> 01:53.797
Um... her bed's wet.

01:53.832 --> 01:55.799
I know.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.269
That's okay!
That's okay.

01:58.303 --> 02:00.103
- All right, let's go.
- Okay, come on.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.576
I heard on the radio
the power lines are down

02:05.610 --> 02:07.878
all along Highway Seven.

02:07.912 --> 02:10.747
Half of Hudson's
still blacked out!

02:10.782 --> 02:12.449
I guess we got off lucky then,
huh?

02:12.484 --> 02:14.885
Well, yeah,
if you call being up

02:14.919 --> 02:18.121
with a crying baby
half the night lucky.

02:18.155 --> 02:19.822
You heard that, eh?

02:19.857 --> 02:21.624
Loud and clear.

02:21.658 --> 02:24.261
<i>Sorry about that, Jack.</i>

02:24.295 --> 02:25.495
But I guess
I don't have to tell you,

02:25.529 --> 02:26.897
you know, this whole
single parenting thing

02:26.931 --> 02:28.131
isn't really working out
the way Lou and I

02:28.165 --> 02:29.165
thought it would.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.434
Well...
you've got Georgie.

02:32.836 --> 02:35.137
She's turning out to be
a pretty good babysitter.

02:35.171 --> 02:37.440
Yeah, Georgie has been great,

02:37.474 --> 02:39.442
but she shouldn't have
to be a babysitter.

02:39.476 --> 02:42.645
You know, what...
Katie really wants is her mom.

02:54.524 --> 02:57.359
Hi, Amy!
Hey, dad.

02:57.394 --> 03:00.029
Well, that was some storm
we had last night, huh?

03:00.063 --> 03:01.363
Yeah, we lost power for hours,

03:01.431 --> 03:04.599
but other than that,
no real problems.

03:04.667 --> 03:05.934
How's Jack doing?

03:05.968 --> 03:08.236
<i>Um... fine, I guess.</i>

03:08.304 --> 03:09.604
No signs of depression -

03:09.639 --> 03:10.772
mood swings, irritability,

03:10.840 --> 03:11.973
loss of appetite?

03:12.041 --> 03:13.942
What are you talking about?

03:14.009 --> 03:16.812
Well, funny you should ask.

03:16.846 --> 03:20.248
Guess who I saw
in town yesterday.

03:49.177 --> 03:50.945
<i>Whoa, Cinders!</i>

03:51.012 --> 03:52.279
Oh!

04:01.822 --> 04:02.889
Whew!

♪ And at the break of day

04:21.341 --> 04:26.245

04:26.313 --> 04:27.547

♪ you dreamer

04:44.197 --> 04:45.797
His name is Cinders.

04:45.832 --> 04:46.965
But considering what happened,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.333
I think we should call him
"Sparky."

04:48.367 --> 04:49.668
I've never heard of
a horse getting shocked

04:49.702 --> 04:51.403
by a pond before.

04:51.437 --> 04:53.005
Well, it was an electric fence
on the bank.

04:53.039 --> 04:54.205
There was a tree
that fell over,

04:54.240 --> 04:55.641
so it made it hard to see.

04:55.675 --> 04:57.142
He seems okay.

04:57.176 --> 04:58.644
Yeah, I don't think
it was so much a shock

04:58.678 --> 05:00.679
as it was a surprise.

05:00.713 --> 05:02.713
Scott checked him out,
said he's okay physically.

05:02.748 --> 05:06.051
But now he's seriously spooked
when it comes to water.

05:06.085 --> 05:08.686
His owner would like you
to work with him.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.256
"Owner?"
Who are we talking about?

05:11.290 --> 05:12.690
Can you keep a secret?

05:12.724 --> 05:14.459
Yeah...

05:14.493 --> 05:15.560
Lisa.

05:15.594 --> 05:18.095
Yeah, dad told me
she was back in town.

05:18.129 --> 05:20.397
So why didn't she just
contact me herself?

05:20.432 --> 05:22.433
Didn't I just tell you
it's a secret?

05:22.467 --> 05:24.368
Yeah, but secret from who?
Grandpa?

05:24.402 --> 05:25.670
Look, Amy,

05:25.704 --> 05:26.971
Lisa knows you're
the right person for the job,

05:27.005 --> 05:28.472
but she was reluctant
to get you involved

05:28.506 --> 05:30.541
because she's been here
for a week,

05:30.576 --> 05:31.809
and she doesn't want
Jack to find out.

05:31.877 --> 05:33.878
So she was hoping that
if he asks any questions...

05:33.912 --> 05:35.312
You want me to lie to grandpa?

05:35.346 --> 05:37.013
Look, who knows how he'll react

05:37.048 --> 05:38.288
if he finds out
that Lisa's here

05:38.316 --> 05:40.384
and she didn't even tell him!

05:40.418 --> 05:41.751
Come on!

06:04.408 --> 06:05.408
Hi, Lisa.

06:05.476 --> 06:06.676
Hi!

06:07.844 --> 06:09.345
You look great.

06:09.413 --> 06:11.514
A lot better than
the last time I saw you.

06:11.548 --> 06:13.048
I thought you were in France.

06:13.117 --> 06:15.518
I was, I was.

06:15.586 --> 06:17.420
I'm here now.

06:17.488 --> 06:18.687
I see that.

06:20.023 --> 06:21.790
How long you been here?

06:21.825 --> 06:25.293
Uh, a few days?
A week, I guess.

06:25.361 --> 06:26.729
Is that right.

06:26.763 --> 06:29.932
I'm selling my place,
lock, stock and barrel -

06:29.966 --> 06:31.967
property and horses.

06:32.035 --> 06:33.736
Everything must go!

06:33.803 --> 06:36.105
Well, I guess
that was always the plan,

06:36.139 --> 06:37.405
wasn't it?

06:37.473 --> 06:40.342
Yeah...
Yeah, I guess it was.

06:44.046 --> 06:46.281
I should go!
I have a lot to do.

06:46.349 --> 06:47.915
So nice to see you.

06:47.983 --> 06:49.618
Nice to see you.

06:49.652 --> 06:52.854
Okay. Bye.

06:52.921 --> 06:54.289
Bye.

07:04.366 --> 07:05.700
Good boy!

07:07.569 --> 07:09.637
Hey, Georgie,
wanna give me a hand?

07:09.705 --> 07:10.638
Yeah, sure.

07:10.706 --> 07:13.607
Is this the new horse, Cinders?

07:13.675 --> 07:14.975
What happened to him?

07:15.043 --> 07:17.378
Well, he got anxious
and rolled in his stall.

07:17.412 --> 07:18.646
It takes forever
to brush him out,

07:18.713 --> 07:19.813
so we'll have to remember
to put a stall sheet

07:19.847 --> 07:21.782
on him next time, okay?

07:21.816 --> 07:22.783
Hey, you know what?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.485
How about you finish up here

07:24.519 --> 07:26.387
and I'll go set up the jumps?

07:26.454 --> 07:28.055
Yeah, sure.

07:30.925 --> 07:35.062
Oh, you really are
a stinky mess, aren't you?

07:37.264 --> 07:40.300
There, that just about does it.

07:41.435 --> 07:42.569
<i>I don't get it.</i>

07:42.603 --> 07:44.404
I thought you said
he was afraid of water?

07:44.438 --> 07:46.306
Well, he is,
so I figure if we practice

07:46.373 --> 07:48.107
jumping the liverpools
when they're empty,

07:48.141 --> 07:50.543
then we can fill them up,
and do it again.

07:50.578 --> 07:52.312
All right?

07:52.346 --> 07:53.813
Let's try this.

08:24.577 --> 08:26.378
All right, he did it!

08:26.412 --> 08:27.979
Yeah, he knows what he's doing,

08:28.013 --> 08:30.115
but this is the easy part.

08:31.651 --> 08:33.083
<i>When are you
going to add the water?</i>

08:33.119 --> 08:37.388
<i>Well, I've gotta get
him used to this, first.</i>

08:37.422 --> 08:39.490
<i>He's looking good!</i>

08:53.905 --> 08:56.607
<i>I'm very flattered
that you brought me here.</i>

08:56.675 --> 08:59.744
I didn't mean to go on, but...

09:01.179 --> 09:03.013
I just don't want
any misunderstandings

09:03.081 --> 09:05.149
or surprises if...

09:06.951 --> 09:08.152
whatever this is

09:08.186 --> 09:11.121
continues past
the little fishing trip here.

09:11.156 --> 09:14.457
Well, whatever this is,
I hope it does continue.

09:14.492 --> 09:15.793
Otherwise, I've got
a few hundred dollars

09:15.860 --> 09:17.261
worth of fishing equipment

09:17.328 --> 09:19.229
I'll never use again!

09:22.700 --> 09:24.734
To whatever it is.

09:25.969 --> 09:27.270
To whatever this is.

09:38.182 --> 09:39.882
Anybody seen Pogie?

09:39.917 --> 09:41.117
You know,
Katie's little uh-

09:41.151 --> 09:43.619
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

09:43.687 --> 09:46.522
So that grey you were taking
over the jumps this afternoon,

09:46.556 --> 09:47.723
what's his story?

09:47.757 --> 09:51.894
Um, Cinders.
His owner's selling him.

09:51.962 --> 09:55.397
Oh, well, I just meant
where's he come from?

09:56.733 --> 09:58.267
Ty brought him over
from the clinic.

09:58.302 --> 09:59.901
Who does he belong to?

09:59.969 --> 10:01.136
Only one person I know

10:01.204 --> 10:02.565
<i>who'd be selling a horse</i>
<i>like that.</i>

10:02.572 --> 10:05.541
Hey, Pete, how's Lou
doing on that book tour?

10:05.608 --> 10:07.309
She must be raking in
the dough, right?

10:07.377 --> 10:08.910
Oh yeah, yeah, great.

10:08.978 --> 10:10.979
Actually, apparently
"Mom's the Word"

10:11.047 --> 10:13.415
is very big in Fredericton.

10:13.483 --> 10:15.083
And who would that person be?

10:15.151 --> 10:17.785
Nobody.
Forget about it, Jack.

10:17.854 --> 10:19.287
Fredericton, really?

10:19.355 --> 10:20.755
Who would've thought that, hey?

10:20.823 --> 10:24.059
I know.

10:26.195 --> 10:28.496
Hey. Thank you.

10:30.733 --> 10:34.702
What?
You really don't know?

10:34.737 --> 10:36.504
Don't know what?

10:37.840 --> 10:40.040
Dad!

10:40.075 --> 10:42.710
Well, I mean you're gonna
find out anyway,

10:42.778 --> 10:44.812
so it's just that...

10:45.781 --> 10:47.715
Spit it out!

10:47.750 --> 10:49.049
Well, the thing is-

10:49.084 --> 10:50.584
Yeah, the thing is,
Lisa's back in town.

10:50.618 --> 10:51.818
Is that what you were
gonna say?

10:51.853 --> 10:53.153
I already know, Tim!

10:53.188 --> 10:55.756
You knew.
Why didn't you say anything?

10:55.790 --> 10:57.424
Why didn't I say anything?!

10:57.492 --> 10:59.059
You're the one
working with her horse

10:59.094 --> 11:01.362
and didn't see fit to tell me!

11:01.429 --> 11:02.629
<i>Oh, now, Jack,</i>

11:02.663 --> 11:05.098
your old girlfriend moves
to France full time.

11:05.132 --> 11:08.268
You know, we don't know how
you're gonna react to the news.

11:08.302 --> 11:09.569
No news!

11:10.527 --> 11:12.047
It doesn't have anything
to do with me.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.540
Or you, for that matter.

11:13.574 --> 11:16.676
So unless you've got something
that's worth listening to,

11:16.711 --> 11:17.977
<i>you can excuse me.</i>

11:18.012 --> 11:19.813
Grandpa, hey!

11:19.847 --> 11:22.382
Look, I wanted to say something,

11:22.416 --> 11:24.350
but you haven't mentioned
a word about Lisa

11:24.385 --> 11:25.818
since you left for Arizona,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.954
so I just figured you didn't
want to hear about it.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.556
I'm a grown man, Amy!

11:30.590 --> 11:33.359
I can decide for myself
whether I want to see Lisa,

11:33.394 --> 11:34.727
or whether I don't!

11:34.761 --> 11:39.698
Yeah, but what if it's her
that doesn't want to see you?

11:44.337 --> 11:46.772
Well, that would be her choice
then, wouldn't it?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.541
I guess.

11:49.910 --> 11:54.446
Grandpa, if Lisa really is
moving to France full time,

11:54.480 --> 11:57.349
this might be your last chance
to ever see her again.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.898
Two nights in a row!
I just don't get it.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.133
How can she still be
wetting her bed?

12:16.201 --> 12:18.102
There wasn't even
any lightning!

12:18.170 --> 12:20.271
Well, there's lots of factors,
you know.

12:20.305 --> 12:23.341
It could be growth spurts,

12:23.408 --> 12:25.877
change of environment,

12:25.911 --> 12:28.479
stress...

12:28.546 --> 12:30.547
Like missing your mommy stress?

12:30.582 --> 12:32.850
Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid so.

12:32.884 --> 12:35.586
<i>So what you're saying is...</i>

12:35.653 --> 12:39.957
Lou has to quit her book tour
and come home?

12:39.992 --> 12:41.925
No! No, no, no.

12:42.861 --> 12:44.294
The tour's important to Lou,

12:44.362 --> 12:47.831
and she doesn't have to quit
and come back.

12:47.866 --> 12:50.300
We are just gonna have
to start giving Katie

12:50.368 --> 12:53.069
lots of extra love
and attention,

12:53.137 --> 12:56.673
and just hope that things
get better.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.475
If Lou can't come home,

12:58.543 --> 13:03.013
then why don't we just go
on the book tour with her?

13:03.047 --> 13:04.314
Okay, well,
I wish it was that simple,

13:04.382 --> 13:06.983
but it's not.
There's lots of problems.

13:07.051 --> 13:08.385
Like?

13:08.452 --> 13:10.720
Like the timing is just bad.

13:10.787 --> 13:12.422
You got your school
and your lessons.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.357
You've got so much
going on here.

13:14.392 --> 13:17.359
And if -
that's a very big "if,"

13:17.427 --> 13:19.595
worst possible case scenario,

13:19.663 --> 13:22.832
if Lou and I decide that
we've run out of options,

13:22.900 --> 13:25.601
then we think that
it would be best if...

13:25.669 --> 13:28.871
If I just went alone
with Katie.

13:43.786 --> 13:45.521
Hey, Lisa!

13:45.555 --> 13:47.022
Hi, Tim!

13:47.057 --> 13:48.424
Gee, we've gotta stop
meeting like this.

13:48.491 --> 13:50.224
Yeah, actually, I'm
glad I ran into you again.

13:50.259 --> 13:51.760
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

13:51.794 --> 13:54.362
Uh-oh. What now?

13:54.396 --> 13:56.297
Just hear me out-

13:56.365 --> 13:57.605
I know Jack won't admit
to this,

13:57.633 --> 13:59.801
but he really wants
to talk to you.

13:59.835 --> 14:01.836
I think he wants to know
if there's still a chance that-

14:01.871 --> 14:04.072
give it up.
Honestly!

14:04.106 --> 14:05.273
I ran into Jack yesterday -

14:05.307 --> 14:07.408
right here,
as a matter of fact -

14:07.443 --> 14:09.410
and it's clear
he doesn't wanna talk with me

14:09.445 --> 14:10.411
about anything!

14:10.446 --> 14:11.812
Oh, come on, you know Jack!

14:11.846 --> 14:13.514
Uh, yeah, I thought I did.

14:13.549 --> 14:15.450
I used to.

14:16.385 --> 14:17.751
I don't think I do anymore.

14:17.786 --> 14:19.554
Well, he's the same
as he always was!

14:19.588 --> 14:20.888
You know, he won't admit
he's made a mistake,

14:20.922 --> 14:23.123
he won't admit when he's wrong.

14:23.157 --> 14:25.926
Which is why he would rather
walk away from a relationship

14:25.961 --> 14:27.595
than try to fix it.

14:27.629 --> 14:29.597
That's why you've got
to make the first move!

14:29.631 --> 14:33.133
Tim! I...

14:33.167 --> 14:34.868
I don't get it.

14:34.903 --> 14:39.039
Why do you care
what happens with me and Jack?

14:39.074 --> 14:42.008
What's in it for you?

14:42.042 --> 14:44.744
I gotta live with him!
That's hard enough.

14:44.778 --> 14:46.779
Can you imagine if I'm right,

14:46.814 --> 14:51.318
and you leaving
breaks his heart all over again?

14:51.352 --> 14:52.752
Uh... uh...

14:54.322 --> 14:55.822
Okay, you know what?

14:55.889 --> 14:58.992
I ride up to lookout point
every morning.

14:59.059 --> 15:03.529
If he's there around 7:30ish,
we'll run into each other.

15:05.032 --> 15:06.398
Okay.

15:14.274 --> 15:16.808
Hey, ever
been to Charlottetown?

15:16.843 --> 15:18.611
No. Why?

15:18.645 --> 15:22.414
Well, neither have
I, and I probably never will!

15:22.482 --> 15:24.016
What's wrong, Georgie?

15:24.050 --> 15:26.352
Well, Peter's talking
about taking Katie

15:26.419 --> 15:28.420
to be with Lou on her book tour

15:28.455 --> 15:30.555
and I can't go
because I have school!

15:30.623 --> 15:31.723
Okay, well,
there's lots of fun things

15:31.758 --> 15:33.591
you can do around here
while they're gone.

15:33.626 --> 15:36.361
Yeah, but Charlottetown
would be a lot more fun!

15:36.428 --> 15:38.463
Okay, fine, be that way!

15:42.769 --> 15:44.136
Thanks.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.664
Did you see that?

16:13.699 --> 16:16.701
He totally kept his stride,
even after he saw the water!

16:16.768 --> 16:17.735
Good boy!

16:17.803 --> 16:19.369
<i>Yeah, he's looking good!</i>

16:19.404 --> 16:21.305
He didn't miss a beat.

16:21.339 --> 16:22.806
So is he better now?

16:22.840 --> 16:25.342
Well, he's jumping over water,
and that's the main thing.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.011
Can I ride him around
the course once?

16:28.079 --> 16:30.013
Georgie, it's a client's horse.

16:30.081 --> 16:31.848
You know Amy can't let you
do that.

16:31.882 --> 16:34.184
All I know is that
nobody ever lets me

16:34.252 --> 16:35.819
do anything around here!

16:35.853 --> 16:39.055
How about you take
Cinders to the barn for me?

16:42.693 --> 16:44.961
And don't forget to
give him some carrots.

16:44.995 --> 16:46.195
Oh, and put his stall sheet on,

16:46.197 --> 16:48.397
so he won't get dirty
if he rolls again.

16:48.432 --> 16:50.734
Okay, I'll do all the work!

17:15.391 --> 17:17.659
<i>So what are you
trying to pull?!</i>

17:17.693 --> 17:19.461
Look, Jack,
if 7:30 doesn't work,

17:19.494 --> 17:20.762
we'll reschedule.

17:20.797 --> 17:22.865
Oh, well, it's not the time
that's the problem,

17:22.898 --> 17:24.566
it's the whole thing!

17:24.599 --> 17:27.669
You set up a meeting for me
without even asking,

17:27.703 --> 17:31.005
with some guy who's selling
two dozen cows and calves

17:31.039 --> 17:33.341
at half the market price!

17:33.376 --> 17:34.676
He's an oil guy.

17:34.710 --> 17:37.479
He's a rich oil guy,
so the money doesn't matter.

17:37.513 --> 17:39.314
Well, then why is he
in such a big hurry

17:39.348 --> 17:41.448
to sell these cattle?

17:41.483 --> 17:43.484
B-because...

17:43.518 --> 17:45.586
he just got married...

17:45.620 --> 17:48.689
uh, to a woman half his age,
and she's a vegetarian.

17:52.694 --> 17:57.531
Why do all your great deals
sound too good to be true?

17:57.565 --> 17:59.500
Because, Jack,

17:59.534 --> 18:00.701
if they didn't sound
too good to be true,

18:00.735 --> 18:02.002
they wouldn't be great deals.

18:02.036 --> 18:04.871
But if you don't want in,
that's fine with me.

18:04.906 --> 18:06.707
It's not going
to hurt my feelings.

18:06.775 --> 18:08.575
Ah, well...

18:08.610 --> 18:11.111
it wouldn't hurt to see
what he's got, I guess.

18:11.179 --> 18:13.380
<i>You know, just to make sure</i>
<i>you got the numbers right.</i>

18:13.448 --> 18:15.481
Great, okay.
7:30?

18:15.516 --> 18:17.918
We'll meet on the road
to lookout point.

18:17.952 --> 18:19.953
I'll meet you there,
we'll see what he's got!

18:19.987 --> 18:22.022
Yeah, I'll see you there.

18:56.289 --> 18:59.158
Lisa!

19:09.427 --> 19:11.828
What, did Tim put you up
to this?

19:12.629 --> 19:14.664
Good morning to you, too!

19:17.070 --> 19:20.804
Uh, yeah, I guess Tim
did put me up to this.

19:20.871 --> 19:22.572
Yeah, well,
he told me he had a friend

19:22.639 --> 19:24.974
that was selling off
some cattle.

19:25.009 --> 19:29.345
Huh! Wow! Well, I can't imagine
your disappointment right now.

19:29.379 --> 19:30.779
Th-that's not what-

19:30.814 --> 19:32.448
What would you and I
have to talk about, anyway?

19:32.516 --> 19:34.317
Your vacation to Arizona?

19:34.351 --> 19:35.518
Yeah, believe me,

19:35.552 --> 19:37.986
last thing I wanna talk about
is Arizona!

19:38.021 --> 19:40.089
Oh, at least it wasn't France.

19:40.156 --> 19:42.558
Well, I just meant that...

19:42.626 --> 19:45.961
there's no point in dredging up
old arguments, Lisa.

19:46.029 --> 19:47.763
Just clinging to the past.

19:47.797 --> 19:51.834
We crossed that bridge
a while ago, didn't we?

19:51.901 --> 19:53.936
Yes. Yes, we sure did.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.505
It's Tim.

19:57.573 --> 19:58.907
I should've known!

19:58.942 --> 20:01.576
Yeah, we both should've known.

20:02.645 --> 20:05.179
Well, look,
something we can agree on.

20:05.214 --> 20:07.282
That's nice, isn't it?

20:17.492 --> 20:18.993
<i>We had fun in France, right?</i>

20:19.027 --> 20:20.661
I thought you weren't
going to bring up the house!

20:20.695 --> 20:22.230
Oh yeah.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.430
I just came out here to work,

20:23.465 --> 20:24.866
not to talk your ear off.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.968
Starting right now!

20:29.872 --> 20:31.572
What?

20:31.606 --> 20:33.774
You're something else,
you know that?

20:33.808 --> 20:35.208
What does that mean?!

20:35.243 --> 20:38.312
It means you're beautiful.

20:51.659 --> 20:53.426
<i>Hey, guys!</i>

20:53.460 --> 20:54.781
I just talked to Lou
on the phone.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.196
She says hi.

20:56.264 --> 20:59.532
I told her what a great job
you've been doing with Katie.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.334
- Thanks.
- Yeah...

21:05.940 --> 21:07.807
So...

21:07.841 --> 21:09.942
I think we both know
that this arrangement

21:09.976 --> 21:12.545
isn't really working
out too well,

21:12.613 --> 21:13.780
right?

21:13.847 --> 21:15.515
So I discussed it with Lou

21:15.582 --> 21:17.617
and we both think that
it's probably a good idea

21:17.651 --> 21:21.621
if I take Katie to see her
sooner as opposed to later.

21:21.689 --> 21:24.456
But you said that was a maybe!

21:24.524 --> 21:25.724
A worst case scenario!

21:25.758 --> 21:27.059
I know, honey, I know.

21:27.127 --> 21:28.560
I know exactly how you feel.

21:28.628 --> 21:29.995
I felt the same way
when my parents

21:30.063 --> 21:31.697
went to the Western Canada
farm show in Regina

21:31.764 --> 21:32.731
without me.

21:32.765 --> 21:36.869
No, this is completely
different!

21:36.937 --> 21:38.938
You know what?
You're right, it is.

21:39.005 --> 21:40.872
Because this isn't
a vacation, okay?

21:40.940 --> 21:42.006
This is a problem.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.542
You know, you guys
are always saying

21:43.609 --> 21:45.344
that I'm a part of this family,

21:45.411 --> 21:47.912
but then, first chance you get,
you dump me!

21:47.947 --> 21:49.948
<i>Honey, no one is dumping you!</i>

21:50.015 --> 21:52.951
But being part of a family
means that...

21:53.018 --> 21:55.053
sometimes you have
to be flexible.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.856
Okay?

21:57.923 --> 21:58.923
I'm sure,
once you think about it,

21:58.991 --> 22:00.291
you'll realize
that we're right.

22:00.326 --> 22:03.661
I've already thought about it
and I think it sucks!

22:16.541 --> 22:18.409
What do you
think you're doing

22:18.477 --> 22:22.513
setting up dates like some
high school match-maker!

22:22.581 --> 22:26.917
Well, you and I obviously went
to different high schools!

22:26.985 --> 22:28.753
What?!

22:28.787 --> 22:31.054
I might've pulled
a few strings,

22:31.122 --> 22:32.822
stretched the truth a little,

22:32.891 --> 22:34.258
but it was for
a good cause, huh?

22:34.325 --> 22:35.359
Heh.

22:35.393 --> 22:36.927
So, how'd it go?
How'd it go?!

22:36.995 --> 22:39.796
I don't appreciate
being made the fool!

22:39.830 --> 22:42.933
Standing there waiting
for some imaginary oil guy

22:42.967 --> 22:45.468
with a herd
of imaginary cattle!

22:45.503 --> 22:47.003
Oh, terrific.

22:47.070 --> 22:48.438
So I hand you a second chance

22:48.472 --> 22:49.773
and you let it just slip away!

22:49.840 --> 22:52.542
I didn't let anything
slip away!

22:52.576 --> 22:54.778
Lisa and I called it quits
months ago!

22:54.812 --> 22:56.679
Come on, Jack!

22:56.714 --> 22:58.381
You and I both know
a relationship ends,

22:58.449 --> 22:59.816
a door closes.

22:59.884 --> 23:02.018
But there's always
a little light

23:02.085 --> 23:04.753
shining around,
through the edges.

23:04.821 --> 23:06.422
So you've got to make a choice.

23:06.456 --> 23:07.924
Do you nail the door shut,

23:07.991 --> 23:09.892
or do you open it wide
one last time?

23:09.927 --> 23:11.961
Well, consider it nailed!

23:11.995 --> 23:13.462
End of story!

23:13.496 --> 23:15.864
I spoke to you,
I spoke to Lisa,

23:15.899 --> 23:17.833
and I could see it, Jack.

23:17.867 --> 23:20.936
I could see it shining through.

23:20.970 --> 23:22.805
I saw the light.

23:22.839 --> 23:25.441
You know, you
missed your calling, Tim.

23:25.475 --> 23:27.175
You really did.

23:27.209 --> 23:28.911
But you're not making a believer
out of me.

23:28.945 --> 23:30.278
You listen to me!

23:30.313 --> 23:33.048
You listen to me.
I'm trying to help you, Jack!

23:33.082 --> 23:35.083
I let it all slip away.

23:35.117 --> 23:36.517
Okay?

23:37.719 --> 23:39.620
Jack!

23:39.655 --> 23:43.724
I'm just trying to help,
so it doesn't happen to you

23:44.927 --> 23:46.928
before it's too late...

23:50.666 --> 23:52.232
Yeah.

23:52.267 --> 23:54.335
Okay, I'll be there.

23:56.338 --> 23:59.039
Amy, that was Scott.
I gotta go.

23:59.074 --> 24:01.241
But I thought you were
dropping by for breakfast?

24:01.276 --> 24:03.544
It's just down the road, Amy,
I'll be back in a bit.

24:03.579 --> 24:04.745
We'll make it a brunch,
is that okay?

24:04.780 --> 24:06.013
Yes.
Oh, hey!

24:06.081 --> 24:08.215
It's your birthday tomorrow,
and...

24:08.283 --> 24:10.084
I don't know what you want.

24:10.118 --> 24:11.418
Well, uh...

24:11.486 --> 24:12.519
it seems to me
that you know a prince

24:12.587 --> 24:13.908
with a few lambos
in his backyard.

24:13.955 --> 24:15.222
I wouldn't mind one of those.

24:15.256 --> 24:16.790
I'm being serious.

24:16.824 --> 24:18.459
So am I.

24:19.394 --> 24:20.627
See you later.
Bye.

24:20.661 --> 24:22.329
See ya, Georgie.

24:22.364 --> 24:24.098
See you.

24:24.132 --> 24:26.132
Everything all right?

24:26.200 --> 24:29.035
I guess, but...
Peter told me

24:29.069 --> 24:31.270
to think about him
and Katie leaving,

24:31.305 --> 24:32.939
and I'm trying,

24:32.974 --> 24:35.475
but all I can think about
is how I wanna go too!

24:35.543 --> 24:37.143
I can see that.

24:37.177 --> 24:39.078
But look on the bright side.

24:39.113 --> 24:40.213
With Katie gone,

24:40.247 --> 24:41.881
then we'd all get more sleep
around here.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.383
I guess.

24:43.450 --> 24:46.351
Katie wet her bed
again last night.

24:46.419 --> 24:48.754
Hey, where have you been?

24:51.257 --> 24:52.497
Am I the only person
around here

24:52.559 --> 24:56.629
that knows how to make
a pot of coffee?!

25:00.266 --> 25:01.366
Tell you what,

25:01.434 --> 25:03.201
how about you go
get Cinders ready,

25:03.269 --> 25:05.504
and I will make grandpa
a pot of coffee.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.972
Sounds like a great plan!

25:15.781 --> 25:17.815
Oh my God,
Amy is going to kill me!

25:35.900 --> 25:37.701
I made you some coffee,
grandpa.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.780
You wanna tell me what's wrong?

25:42.807 --> 25:44.241
Nothin'.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.210
Everything's hunky dory.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.580
Grandpa, come on.

25:49.647 --> 25:50.681
<i>Your father,</i>

25:50.715 --> 25:52.482
he told me
I was going to meet a guy

25:52.516 --> 25:54.284
with a dozen cow calf pairs.

25:54.351 --> 25:57.955
Instead, I met Lisa!

25:58.022 --> 25:59.790
And no cows.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.825
You must've been
so disappointed.

26:01.859 --> 26:03.259
That's...

26:05.162 --> 26:07.030
Grandpa, I'm so sorry.

26:08.014 --> 26:09.575
Ever since I heard
she was back in town,

26:09.600 --> 26:13.769
I kinda hoped you two
would work something out.

26:14.738 --> 26:15.938
Yeah, me too.

26:15.973 --> 26:18.208
<i>Well then, don't give up -</i>

26:18.242 --> 26:20.676
and don't let dad
screw things up!

26:22.779 --> 26:25.514
Grandpa, Lisa loved you...

26:25.548 --> 26:28.050
and you loved her.

26:28.085 --> 26:30.953
<i>You don't have to just</i>
<i>let it end like this.</i>

26:38.895 --> 26:41.696
<i>Get 'em in the
water, here we go!</i>

26:48.538 --> 26:50.372
<i>Do you want to turn in early?</i>

26:50.406 --> 26:51.573
What are you getting at, Lisa?

26:51.608 --> 26:54.075
You think I can't stay up
past nine o'clock?

26:54.110 --> 26:56.011
No, I didn't say that.

26:56.045 --> 26:58.079
Maybe not,
but you have been treating me

26:58.114 --> 26:59.580
like a relic of the old west

26:59.615 --> 27:01.650
ever since you bought me
that ridiculous saddle.

27:01.684 --> 27:04.585
Jack, that's what I do.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.888
I fuss, I worry,

27:06.922 --> 27:08.089
I buy inappropriate gifts.

27:08.157 --> 27:12.894
That's just what I do
with someone I love.

27:12.928 --> 27:15.596
Um... someone you...

27:15.631 --> 27:16.664
Well, you're never
gonna say it,

27:16.731 --> 27:17.665
but that's not gonna stop me.

27:17.732 --> 27:19.867
I'm gonna tell you
how I-

27:19.934 --> 27:23.904
♪ The subtle hints
my heart's conveying ♪

27:24.839 --> 27:28.108
♪ when I feel lost
she takes my hand ♪

27:29.778 --> 27:31.879
♪ and whispers softly
she understands ♪

27:31.913 --> 27:33.047
Woo!

27:54.210 --> 27:57.304
Hello, Lisa.
It's Jack.

28:28.668 --> 28:30.502
Cinders, whoa!

28:30.569 --> 28:32.237
Agghhh!

28:34.540 --> 28:36.308
<i>Hold still!</i>

28:36.342 --> 28:38.142
<i>Easy, boy!</i>

28:39.077 --> 28:40.378
Agghhh!

28:40.446 --> 28:43.147
Oh! Agh!
Amy, come quick!

28:43.182 --> 28:44.248
What's wrong?

28:44.317 --> 28:45.950
Uh-
Georgie, turn the hose off!

28:46.018 --> 28:49.153
What are you doing?!
Turn off the hose!

28:50.669 --> 28:52.549
The poor guy, he's
probably so traumatized,

28:52.574 --> 28:53.974
we're back at square one!

28:54.009 --> 28:55.289
<i>What were you thinking,</i>
<i>Georgie?!</i>

28:55.311 --> 28:57.578
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to keep him clean.

28:57.646 --> 28:58.846
You know he's afraid of water;

28:58.880 --> 29:00.415
that's the whole reason
he's here!

29:00.449 --> 29:02.116
Well, I thought he was
just afraid of pools,

29:02.150 --> 29:04.585
nobody ever said anything
about hoses!

29:04.620 --> 29:05.787
Look...

29:05.821 --> 29:06.981
Let's just get him dried off,

29:06.988 --> 29:08.856
and we'll see
where we're at, okay?

29:37.318 --> 29:38.518
Oh! Agh!

29:38.553 --> 29:40.721
Amy, are you okay?

29:40.755 --> 29:42.188
No! No, I'm not okay,

29:42.223 --> 29:43.323
and neither is this damn horse!

29:43.357 --> 29:47.426
I can't believe you did
what you did!

29:50.097 --> 29:52.698
Georgie, wait.
Hey-

29:52.733 --> 29:54.094
<i>I can't do anything right!</i>

29:54.101 --> 29:56.903
Look, I didn't mean it
like that!

30:02.976 --> 30:05.077
<i>Oh no.</i>

30:05.111 --> 30:06.679
Not now!

30:13.286 --> 30:14.319
- Lisa.
- Hi!

30:14.387 --> 30:15.553
Hi, it's so good to see you.

30:15.621 --> 30:16.855
How are you doing, honey?

30:16.890 --> 30:17.923
I was so worried when I heard
about your accident,

30:17.991 --> 30:19.591
but you look like
you're doing great!

30:19.625 --> 30:21.593
Yeah, thanks.

30:21.627 --> 30:22.827
And you, look at you!

30:22.862 --> 30:23.628
You look like
you've been living on a ranch

30:23.696 --> 30:25.764
<i>your whole life!</i>

30:26.732 --> 30:28.800
So how are things going
with Cinders?

30:28.834 --> 30:32.003
Um, to be honest, not so great.

30:32.070 --> 30:33.137
You might have to change
your plans

30:33.171 --> 30:34.472
about shipping him out so soon.

30:34.540 --> 30:35.973
Oh! What happened?

30:36.041 --> 30:37.709
Things were going really well,

30:37.777 --> 30:40.077
but then there was
a little incident

30:40.112 --> 30:42.079
with some water and a hose.
Oh...

30:42.147 --> 30:43.481
<i>It was my fault!</i>

30:43.516 --> 30:45.583
I made a really stupid mistake
and I'm really sorry!

30:45.651 --> 30:47.084
Oh, well...

30:47.152 --> 30:48.185
you know what, girls?

30:48.220 --> 30:49.553
I'm sure you're doing
your very best.

30:49.621 --> 30:50.654
And the truth is,

30:50.688 --> 30:52.256
I'm not here to talk
about the horse,

30:52.324 --> 30:54.525
I'm here to talk to Jack.

30:54.592 --> 30:55.559
Oh?

30:55.593 --> 30:56.827
So if you don't mind,

30:56.895 --> 30:58.329
I'm gonna just leave you to it

30:58.397 --> 30:59.797
and we'll catch up later.

30:59.864 --> 31:01.565
Yeah.
Okay.

31:04.101 --> 31:06.169
Hey, Georgie, look.

31:07.238 --> 31:08.806
I'm sorry, okay?

31:08.873 --> 31:11.908
I shouldn'tve gotten mad
at you for that.

31:11.976 --> 31:14.277
I'm sorry too.

31:14.345 --> 31:15.778
Come on, why don't we
put Cinders in the paddock

31:15.846 --> 31:17.747
with the other horses?
Okay.

31:41.839 --> 31:44.373
Uh... yeah,
c-come on in, Lis!

31:50.347 --> 31:52.448
Hi!

31:52.515 --> 31:54.416
Hi.

31:54.484 --> 31:55.884
I'm uh...

31:55.952 --> 31:59.754
I'm really glad that
you were able to make it.

32:00.690 --> 32:02.190
Well, you know what they say,

32:02.224 --> 32:03.992
third time's a charm.

32:04.026 --> 32:05.794
Yeah.

32:05.862 --> 32:07.762
Um...

32:07.830 --> 32:09.898
I-I made coffee.

32:09.932 --> 32:11.633
You went all out!

32:11.667 --> 32:13.334
You must feel pretty badly.

32:13.369 --> 32:15.370
Well, I'm trying
to impress you.

32:15.437 --> 32:16.737
Oh...

32:16.771 --> 32:20.875
And I'm trying to say
I'm sorry about this morning.

32:23.879 --> 32:27.448
I am sorry about this morning.

32:33.488 --> 32:37.190
Yeah, it didn't, uh... quite go
as I had hoped.

32:37.225 --> 32:39.627
But then, I didn't have to be
tricked into seeing you again.

32:41.329 --> 32:42.329
It kinda made me wonder

32:42.397 --> 32:43.764
why I came back to Hudson
at all.

32:43.798 --> 32:46.299
Well, I assume it's to sell off
your place.

32:46.334 --> 32:47.968
Isn't that what you told me?

32:48.003 --> 32:49.136
Mm-hmm.

32:49.170 --> 32:50.970
That's what I told myself,

32:51.005 --> 32:54.674
but I could've done
all of that from France.

32:54.708 --> 32:57.310
So I have to admit that I um...

32:57.345 --> 32:59.346
missed this, I guess.

33:00.581 --> 33:02.715
I miss sitting in your kitchen,

33:02.750 --> 33:04.551
drinking your coffee,

33:04.618 --> 33:06.719
and chatting with you about...

33:06.754 --> 33:08.721
anything, everything,

33:08.756 --> 33:12.592
even if it's
our "relationship."

33:12.626 --> 33:14.360
Or whatever this is.

33:15.295 --> 33:17.697
Yeah, whatever this is.

33:23.770 --> 33:26.238
Oh! Is that my goddaughter?
Yes, it is.

33:26.306 --> 33:28.140
Boy, she has a pair of lungs
on her, doesn't she?

33:28.175 --> 33:29.675
Yes, she does.

33:30.810 --> 33:32.111
Lou's been away,

33:32.179 --> 33:35.114
and Katie's not
taking it too well.

33:35.182 --> 33:38.684
Aw! I'm dying
to see her!

33:43.155 --> 33:45.390
Good boy.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.092
All right, there you go.

33:53.967 --> 33:56.434
<i>Look at him go.</i>

33:58.270 --> 34:01.739
<i>It's like he really wants
to be with the other horses.</i>

34:01.807 --> 34:02.974
Yeah.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.175
You know, I think that's why
he gets restless

34:04.243 --> 34:05.310
and rolls in his stall.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.079
He just doesn't like
to be by himself.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.414
<i>You know what?</i>

34:09.447 --> 34:12.483
<i>Maybe we've been going</i>
<i>about this all wrong.</i>

34:12.550 --> 34:13.750
I think Cinders is a follower,

34:13.784 --> 34:15.552
not a leader.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.522
So?
So what do followers do?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.791
They follow?
Mm-hmm.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.827
I've got an idea
that might just work.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.829
But...

34:24.896 --> 34:26.030
I think I'm gonna need
your help.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.598
You wanna go ask Peter
if it's okay?

34:27.632 --> 34:29.132
Yeah, sure!
Okay.

34:41.790 --> 34:43.824
- What's going on?
- Shh! Shh!

34:43.891 --> 34:45.324
Lisa's just putting Katie down
for a nap.

34:45.393 --> 34:46.994
So...

34:47.027 --> 34:50.097
Well, I don't hear any crying.

34:54.068 --> 34:56.670
There you go, nothing to it.

34:56.737 --> 34:57.771
Oh, I've missed so much!

34:57.805 --> 35:00.974
She's grown into
such a little girl!

35:01.009 --> 35:02.776
If you wanna know
what I think...

35:02.843 --> 35:04.044
Yeah!

35:05.413 --> 35:08.015
Don't let me stop you,
you never have before!

35:09.384 --> 35:10.483
Well, I don't have kids
of my own,

35:10.518 --> 35:11.818
but I certainly know
what it's like

35:11.852 --> 35:12.852
to miss somebody so much

35:12.887 --> 35:16.823
that it colours
everything you do.

35:16.891 --> 35:19.992
I think it's simple:
She just misses her mom.

35:20.027 --> 35:23.329
Yeah, I know she does,
but the thing is...

35:23.363 --> 35:24.764
it's not just Katie
I'm dealing with,

35:24.799 --> 35:26.900
there's Lou's book tour, right,

35:26.934 --> 35:28.535
and of course
Georgie's got school, so-

35:28.569 --> 35:30.202
<i>Actually...</i>

35:30.237 --> 35:31.503
I changed my mind.

35:31.538 --> 35:35.841
I think you and Katie should go
on Lou's book tour.

35:36.776 --> 35:39.378
Oh, honey, you don't...

35:41.448 --> 35:42.949
Are you sure?

35:42.983 --> 35:45.818
Yeah, I'm sure.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.185
Can I go riding with Amy now?

35:47.219 --> 35:49.287
Yeah!
Yeah, of course.

36:02.234 --> 36:03.935
Hi!
Hey.

36:06.305 --> 36:08.974
Hey, is that
Lisa's SUV over there?

36:09.008 --> 36:10.641
Yeah, she came to see grandpa.

36:10.676 --> 36:13.078
Really?
Yeah, hopefully they can work something out.

36:13.112 --> 36:14.145
But in the meantime,

36:14.180 --> 36:15.113
I need your help
with the horses.

36:15.147 --> 36:16.514
Yeah, sure, no problem.

36:16.548 --> 36:19.684
Oh, and I'd love to know
what you want for your birthday,

36:19.718 --> 36:21.786
actually.

36:21.854 --> 36:22.887
You know what I want.

36:22.921 --> 36:24.154
No, Ty, seriously!

36:24.189 --> 36:27.525
It's tomorrow,
so I'd love a hint!

36:27.559 --> 36:29.326
Okay.
How's that?

36:29.361 --> 36:32.396
<i>Um, excuse me?</i>

36:32.464 --> 36:34.532
Aren't we supposed
to be taking Cinders out?

36:34.566 --> 36:35.800
Yes, we are.

36:35.868 --> 36:40.204
I'll go grab Spartan.
You wanna tack up Harley?

36:40.238 --> 36:42.973
<i>Well, I guess we
didn't manage to get much...</i>

36:43.041 --> 36:45.642
<i>"talking things over" done.</i>

36:46.611 --> 36:48.645
No! No, we didn't.

36:50.015 --> 36:52.582
How long's Amy gonna
have your horse?

36:52.650 --> 36:54.985
Well, I booked transport
for him tomorrow,

36:55.019 --> 36:56.486
if he's ready.

36:56.554 --> 36:58.754
Maybe we use my trailer,

36:58.822 --> 37:01.590
and we take him
down there ourselves.

37:01.658 --> 37:06.028
There's nothing like being
stuck in a truck together

37:06.062 --> 37:09.498
for a few hours
to help figure things out.

37:09.566 --> 37:11.500
You know what?

37:11.568 --> 37:14.003
That kinda sounds like a date.

37:14.070 --> 37:16.438
So, we're on, then?

37:16.506 --> 37:17.972
Yeah, I guess we're on.

37:18.941 --> 37:22.610
But we're going in
the Fairfield truck and trailer

37:22.678 --> 37:25.180
'cause it doesn't break down
every time you get in it!

37:25.248 --> 37:27.015
And it's got all the bells
and whistles:

37:27.083 --> 37:29.851
GPS unit, heated seats.

37:31.154 --> 37:33.888
Okay...
as long as I drive.

37:33.956 --> 37:35.222
Of course.

37:35.257 --> 37:37.992
Good, I'll check with Amy,
see how he's coming along,

37:38.060 --> 37:39.093
and if it's a go,

37:39.161 --> 37:42.630
I'll see you
at 7:30 tomorrow morning.

37:42.665 --> 37:45.533
Uh... let's say
nine-thirty or ten.

37:45.568 --> 37:47.334
I like to get an early start.

37:47.369 --> 37:48.635
Well, I know you do,

37:48.670 --> 37:50.571
but I've got a few things
to do in the morning.

37:50.638 --> 37:52.073
Okay.

37:52.140 --> 37:54.175
Nine-thirty.
Or ten.

38:16.998 --> 38:19.365
Ty was the last one
to mess with this truck.

38:19.433 --> 38:21.401
He's gone and done something.

38:21.435 --> 38:24.471
Well, that'll teach you
not to let me drive, eh?

38:24.505 --> 38:26.005
I think you flooded it.

38:26.039 --> 38:27.940
No I haven't flooded it!

38:27.975 --> 38:30.009
All right.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.478
Well, let's let it rest
for a while.

38:31.512 --> 38:33.213
Let's forget about the sale.

38:33.247 --> 38:35.014
More horses
than I can deal with.

38:37.418 --> 38:38.651
You hungry?

38:40.921 --> 38:43.522
Turkey and Swiss?
Or Turkey and Swiss?

38:45.492 --> 38:46.659
Turkey and Swiss.

38:46.693 --> 38:48.761
<i>Good answer.</i>

38:50.296 --> 38:52.331
And I made you coffee!

38:52.365 --> 38:53.966
Aren't you something!

38:54.001 --> 38:55.667
<i>Aren't I?</i>

39:07.013 --> 39:08.514
- You ready?
- Absolutely!

39:08.548 --> 39:09.948
Let's go!

39:15.621 --> 39:17.689
Cinders, come here!

39:19.291 --> 39:22.493
<i>Up! Up! Keep going!</i>

39:33.605 --> 39:36.006
Come on,
Cinders, it's okay!

39:36.041 --> 39:37.741
<i>You can do it!</i>

39:39.978 --> 39:41.979
<i>- Good boy!</i>
<i>- There you go!</i>

40:01.508 --> 40:03.906
<i>Continue on
current route for one hundred meters,</i>

40:04.017 --> 40:07.019
<i>then turn left on rural route</i>
<i>twenty-seven.</i>

40:07.087 --> 40:09.689
Well, it's a good thing
we've got that gadget.

40:09.756 --> 40:12.692
I might've missed a turn
I've been taking all my life.

40:18.898 --> 40:19.932
I think it's so great

40:19.999 --> 40:21.633
they're going on
that trip together.

40:21.701 --> 40:24.236
Yeah, well...

40:24.303 --> 40:26.371
you gotta appreciate
how I played that one.

40:26.439 --> 40:28.807
What... what are you
talking about?!

40:28.842 --> 40:30.508
After that stunt you pulled,

40:30.543 --> 40:33.077
I basically had to beg grandpa
to give it another try!

40:33.145 --> 40:36.648
Amy, the thing is,
with a situation like this,

40:36.682 --> 40:38.983
you gotta know
when to step forward

40:39.051 --> 40:41.486
and when to step back.

40:53.531 --> 40:55.133
Oh, I got a message.

40:55.167 --> 40:58.302
Did we go out of cell range?

40:58.336 --> 41:01.405
It's from my real estate agent.

41:05.510 --> 41:08.579
I got an offer on Fairfield.

41:09.547 --> 41:11.815
Well, it's not exactly
what we were asking,

41:11.849 --> 41:13.884
but it's definitely
in the ballpark.

41:13.918 --> 41:17.053
So you gonna accept it?

41:18.022 --> 41:20.390
Uh... I don't know.

41:20.424 --> 41:24.360
I can't believe
it happened that fast!

41:24.395 --> 41:25.695
And now I have no bars.

41:25.729 --> 41:26.897
No?

41:26.931 --> 41:29.132
So you can't make
a decision then,

41:29.167 --> 41:30.901
until you're back
in the cell range, right?

41:30.935 --> 41:32.969
No...

41:33.004 --> 41:34.537
No.

41:34.571 --> 41:38.274
Well, I have to know
all my options now, don't I?

41:38.309 --> 41:41.076
That's what this trip's
all about, isn't it?

41:41.111 --> 41:43.946
Yeah, I suppose you could
call it that.

41:49.853 --> 41:51.187
So we're all good?

41:51.221 --> 41:52.521
Yeah.

41:52.555 --> 41:54.456
I am gonna miss
you guys though.

41:54.490 --> 41:56.525
Come here!

41:56.559 --> 41:58.060
I'm going to miss you, too.

41:58.094 --> 42:00.129
And Lou already misses you
so much,

42:00.163 --> 42:02.464
she can barely stand it!

42:02.498 --> 42:03.833
But we will all be
together again,

42:03.867 --> 42:05.000
as a family, very soon.

42:05.035 --> 42:07.136
Okay?
Okay.

42:07.170 --> 42:10.038
Well, you better get going.

42:14.444 --> 42:16.445

42:26.989 --> 42:29.057
Yeah, I think so.

That's it right there!

42:38.067 --> 42:41.635
Nah, that doesn't look
like much.

42:41.670 --> 42:44.204
<i>Well, the GPS is programmed
to choose the shortest route,</i>

42:44.272 --> 42:45.439
and I should get back
into cell range

42:45.507 --> 42:47.408
as soon as possible.

42:47.476 --> 42:48.709
If you leave the main highway

42:48.777 --> 42:50.411
and go onto a road like that,

42:50.479 --> 42:52.080
you never know where
you're gonna end up!

42:52.113 --> 42:56.049
Luckily, this is a very
top-of-the-line GPS unit,

42:56.117 --> 42:57.117
and where it says
we're gonna end up

42:57.185 --> 42:58.952
is exactly where
we're gonna end up!
