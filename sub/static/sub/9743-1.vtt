12:27.247 --> 12:29.113
- Good.
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.324
- [grunts]
- It's coming!

12:31.417 --> 12:32.658
What? Where? Who?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.493
The Great Flood!

12:34.587 --> 12:37.421
Those floodgates won't hold
forever, you know!

12:37.507 --> 12:39.214
We're doomed!

12:39.300 --> 12:41.838
You think you can back
away from the truth!

12:41.928 --> 12:44.511
'Ello, hello, hello. What's all this then?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.589
Oh, thank heavens! A policeman!

12:46.683 --> 12:48.424
This wacko has been chasing after me!

12:48.518 --> 12:50.885
- Morning, Harold.
- Morning, Collin. How are you?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.720
I can't complain.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.226
Keep an eye on this one.
He's a bit of a loony.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.852
- What? Me?
- We're doomed, I tell you!

12:56.943 --> 12:58.650
- Are you kidding me?
- Right.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.853
Let's give you a police escort home, then.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.483
Oh, great! Um...

13:02.573 --> 13:06.112
I live in Kensington.
Up there. The surface.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.866
Up Top? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.118
The humans don't like our sort.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.622
Speak for yourself.
They like me very much up there.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.500
Oh, I don't like your attitude.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.047
I've got my eye on you, sunshine.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.379
- [sizzling]
- Ooh! Ooh, hot, hot, hot!

13:23.469 --> 13:27.258
So... You're trying
to get Up Top, me hearty?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.344
- Yes.
- [sizzling]

13:30.435 --> 13:31.551
[yelps]

13:31.644 --> 13:35.729
There's one person 'round here
might be able to help you.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.556
- Might.
- Really?

13:37.650 --> 13:41.735
Shady customer.
The captain of the <i>Jammy Dodger.</i>

13:42.196 --> 13:45.906
- If you can find it.
- I know where it is!

13:53.166 --> 13:57.752
[echoing] And remember,
the name of the boat's the <i>Jammy Dodger.</i>

13:58.254 --> 14:00.746
Uh, thanks for bringing me this far.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.048
[echoing] You're welcome.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.344
[fish] See ya!

14:08.848 --> 14:11.761
[whistling]

14:11.851 --> 14:14.434
[eerie drone]

14:14.687 --> 14:17.555
[whistling]

14:20.068 --> 14:24.859
Beware. Beware.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.191
Hello?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.115
Uh, permission to come aboard?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.872
- [boards creaking]
- Ahoy there?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.617
Uh...

14:44.008 --> 14:46.295
[creaking]

14:48.429 --> 14:52.969
[creaking]

14:53.518 --> 14:57.683
[playful music]

14:58.064 --> 14:59.305
[gasps]

14:59.399 --> 15:01.436
Ow! Yah! Oh. Oh!

15:01.526 --> 15:04.769
Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude,
Mr. Captain Skipper Thingy.

15:04.862 --> 15:08.731
Hey! That's Miss Captain
Skipper Thingy to you.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.817
- Oops.
- What are you doing on my boat?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.324
Look, I've had a really bad day
and I just need your help.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.498
See, I've been thrown out of my home,
I've been flushed down my toilet.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.417
Thank you, too much information.
I've got my own problems, mate.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.790
- [male rat] She's around here somewhere!
- [punches]

15:22.880 --> 15:25.964
Stay down. And keep quiet.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.461
Why? Who are we hiding from?

15:30.555 --> 15:34.344
I said quiet! There's rats
after me who'd like to kill me.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.676
Well, I'll contain my amazement.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.885
[groans]

15:37.979 --> 15:41.188
All right, all right. Quiet as a mouse.

15:42.108 --> 15:46.603
- [lever creaks]
- [horn blares]

15:47.071 --> 15:48.687
- [gasps]
- Ah!

15:49.323 --> 15:51.531
[male rat] Over there!

15:51.617 --> 15:52.778
You idiot!

15:52.869 --> 15:54.735
Sorry about that. [chuckles]

15:54.829 --> 15:56.536
Uh, I'll be offthen.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.204
Oh, sorry. Ah!

15:58.291 --> 16:01.329
- [horn blares]
- Sorry. Sorry.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.500
Sorry!

16:02.587 --> 16:04.078
[male rat] We can't let her get away!

16:04.964 --> 16:07.206
- [screaming]
- Shh. Shh.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.088
Come on, <i>Jammy,</i> me old mate,
don't do this to me!

16:10.636 --> 16:12.002
[grunting]

16:12.096 --> 16:13.837
- Come on.
- Get her.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.638
- Oh.
- Ah!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.596
Whoa!

16:18.686 --> 16:20.143
- Oh.
- Ah!

16:21.314 --> 16:23.556
Let me go, you pink-eyed freak!

16:23.649 --> 16:25.982
- [glasses clattering]
- I'm upset now.

16:26.611 --> 16:27.727
Ah!

16:27.820 --> 16:30.153
Whatever's going on here,
I swear, I'm not involved.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.401
[yells] I'm an innocent bystander!

16:33.159 --> 16:35.742
Rita, Rita, Rita!

16:36.162 --> 16:39.121
[cackling]

16:39.207 --> 16:41.574
You thought you could give us the slip.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.909
- [yelling]
- [thuds]

16:44.003 --> 16:46.461
What you looking at?
Keep still! Come on, then!

16:46.547 --> 16:48.004
Right!

16:49.050 --> 16:51.588
Who have we got here?

16:51.677 --> 16:54.920
I believe he said his name
was Millicent Bystander.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.757
- [snorts] Millicent!
- Actually, no...

16:57.850 --> 17:01.093
Now, then, where's the ruby, Rita?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.099
The boss wants it back.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.930
I don't have your stupid ruby.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.939
Okay, are we going to do it
the easy way...

17:09.028 --> 17:10.894
or the hard way?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.946
Oh, I think we should do it
the easy way, don't you, Spike?

17:14.032 --> 17:15.365
Oh.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.529
[sighs] All right. Check the tin.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.738
Good girl.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.742
See, Whitey, this is how I do it.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.574
Watch and learn, my son. Watch and...

17:24.669 --> 17:26.285
[yelps]

17:27.380 --> 17:30.168
- [whistling]
- [crashes]

17:31.592 --> 17:32.878
Was it in there?

17:32.969 --> 17:35.131
Right! Rip it up, lads!

17:35.221 --> 17:36.757
[can clanging]

17:36.847 --> 17:40.340
Hey, you get your
filthy paws off my stuff!

17:41.102 --> 17:42.638
- [chuckling]
- [scoffs]

17:42.728 --> 17:45.471
It's in here somewhere.
I can feel it in me guts!

17:45.565 --> 17:47.557
That'll be last night's curry, Spike.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.563
I'm the same.
I got a bum like a Japanese flag.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.066
Will you please tell them
I'm not involved in this?

17:53.155 --> 17:54.487
- [male rat] Nothing here.
- Fine.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.156
All right, all right, listen up.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.780
This gentleman, he's not from around here.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.031
- Thank you.
- Just look how nicely he's dressed.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.909
- Oh, thank you.
- And why?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.415
Because he's an international jewel thief!

18:05.501 --> 18:08.869
- Precisely. What? No, no!
- He stole the ruby from me!

18:08.963 --> 18:10.723
- If you just put me down.
- No, she's lying!

18:10.756 --> 18:14.340
All right, all right!
It's time to bring out...

18:14.427 --> 18:16.384
the Persuader.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.008
- [chomps]
- [all gasp]

18:19.098 --> 18:23.092
Your choice, mate.
You can talk now or you can talk later.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.596
Ain't that right, Persuader?

18:24.687 --> 18:27.680
Yeah, in a much higher voice!

18:27.773 --> 18:30.015
The Persuader's alive, Spike!

18:30.109 --> 18:32.396
You'll be singing like a tea kettle.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.148
[chuckles] Good one, Persuader.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.946
I don't even know her!
I don't know anything about anything!

18:37.366 --> 18:39.824
Careful, miss. You'll injure yourself.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.867
[gasps] Oh! I know where it is!

18:41.954 --> 18:44.287
- I know where it is!
- Come on, then. Spit it out!

18:44.373 --> 18:46.205
Don't you dare!

18:46.292 --> 18:49.501
Look at her bottom.
I mean, is it me, or is it oddly shaped?

18:49.587 --> 18:52.125
You little snitch.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.797
The booty's in the booty.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.876
Hey! [grunting]

18:57.970 --> 18:59.427
[clanging]

18:59.513 --> 19:01.095
[all] Oh.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.178
[laughing]

19:04.268 --> 19:08.308
Thanks, mate! The boss is
gonna be so happy with us.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.523
You're toast.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.816
[laughing]

19:15.821 --> 19:17.312
So you're from Up Top, eh?

19:17.823 --> 19:20.657
I used to work in a laboratory Up Top.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.905
Yeah. Big shampoo job.

19:23.329 --> 19:27.198
I was dark grey when we started.
Yeah.

19:27.291 --> 19:31.240
Still, it cleared up me dandruff.
[chuckles]

19:31.754 --> 19:35.543
[announcer] <i>The World Cup has become the
most popular sporting event in the world.</i>

19:35.633 --> 19:37.670
Are you there, boss? We're back.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.237
[announcer]
<i>...plays Germany in the final.</i>

19:39.261 --> 19:41.173
I've got it, boss.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.717
The ruby. I found it.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.054
Well, technically, Spike,
it was Millicent that found it.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.137
Um, actually, the name's Roddy.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.599
And, and, in exchange for my assistance,
I was hoping you might...

19:53.693 --> 19:54.693
- [slaps]
- [fly yelps]

19:55.986 --> 20:00.356
Uh, you might help me
out of the pickle I'm in.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.032
[yells, shudders]

20:03.494 --> 20:05.406
Hello, Rita.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.237
Hello, handsome.

20:07.748 --> 20:11.116
And who is this?
Is your new boyfriend a waiter?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.293
- Boyfriend?
- Waiter?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.254
[chuckling]

20:14.256 --> 20:15.621
[snaps fingers]

20:15.715 --> 20:18.253
The prize returns to me.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.628
[blows sharply]

20:20.553 --> 20:23.546
Did you imagine that
I would let you steal it from me?

20:23.639 --> 20:27.303
What? That jewel belongs
to my father, and you know it!

20:27.393 --> 20:29.350
- [Rita yells]
- Your father?

20:29.645 --> 20:32.638
A good-for-nothing scavenger,
just like his daughter!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.473
- [muffled yells]
- Uh, excuse me.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.150
Actually, I'm the one
that found your ruby.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.775
So... you... um...

20:40.865 --> 20:43.983
Perhaps you'd be generous enough
to repay the favor and help me get home.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.317
- [squeals]
- [yelps]

20:45.411 --> 20:47.277
- Help me!
- [chomps]

20:47.830 --> 20:49.492
Dispose of them.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.789
No, no, no, please!

20:50.875 --> 20:53.288
- I just want to get home to Kensington!
- [Toad gasps]

20:54.795 --> 20:57.503
Kensington? The Royal Borough?

20:58.257 --> 21:02.001
- Up Top?
- Uh, yes. Up Top.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.712
Huzzah! A man of quality!

21:05.806 --> 21:07.843
Finally, somebody gets it.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.596
Come, let me show you
my private collection.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.848
I know you'll find it diverting.

21:12.938 --> 21:13.938
[laughing]

21:15.608 --> 21:17.600
- [Toad laughing]
- [uplifting music]

21:17.693 --> 21:20.026
My shrine to beauty.

21:20.112 --> 21:24.948
Works of high art crafted in tribute
to our beloved Royal Family.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.993
Victoria's bust, wrought in porcelain.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.037
- Classy!
- Quite lifelike, wouldn't you say?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.490
[laughs] It's as if she were here.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.042
Mmm. Smooth to the touch.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.041
- Easy, tiger.
- [giggles]

21:39.131 --> 21:44.422
But come! Let us restore the heart
and highlight of my collection...

21:45.054 --> 21:49.549
this ruby. Fallen from
the very brow of ancient kings.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.760
A true crown jewel!

21:53.604 --> 21:56.688
["Rule Britannia!" plays]

21:56.774 --> 21:58.606
Well, what do you think?

21:58.692 --> 22:01.480
He's a madman! Run away! [shrieks]

22:01.570 --> 22:03.903
Pardon me. My fly's undone.

22:04.198 --> 22:08.488
[chuckles] Well, your ruby
certainly is a biggie.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.159
Indeed.

22:10.913 --> 22:15.078
How did it ever find me,
here in the underbelly of the world?

22:15.626 --> 22:17.868
In this dark, low place.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.793
Yes, speaking of which,
I'd love to see more of your collection.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.590
It's very amusing, but I do...

22:24.677 --> 22:26.259
- "Amusing"?
- [wincing]

22:26.345 --> 22:28.177
Didn't you say I'd find it amusing?

22:28.264 --> 22:32.383
I said you'd find it diverting,
not amusing!

22:32.476 --> 22:35.765
Ah, well, when I said "amusing"
I really meant it in the sense

22:35.855 --> 22:39.098
of the ancient Greek muse,
the goddess of inspiration.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.978
[gasps, chuckles nervously]

22:41.068 --> 22:42.229
Muse.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.243
[shatters]

22:53.122 --> 22:55.034
- Smashing.
- [chuckles]

22:55.124 --> 22:58.413
- [growling]
- Oh, heaven help me!

22:59.044 --> 23:01.127
Ice him! Ice them both!

23:02.256 --> 23:05.875
Let's see if there's
anything good in the fridge.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.794
- Former enemies, one and all.
- [gasps]

23:09.889 --> 23:14.224
[Toad] A catalogue of thieves,
double-crossers, and do-gooders.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.267
[Toad cackling]

23:17.229 --> 23:19.221
Prepare to meet your maker.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.932
Your ice maker. [chortles]

23:22.026 --> 23:24.814
[chuckles] Makes me laugh
every time, that one.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.270
Shut that door.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.029
[Roddy] Liquid nitrogen!
That will freeze us instantly!

23:32.119 --> 23:34.702
There's a paper clip in my back pocket.
See if you can get it.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.996
[yelps] In the pocket, in the pocket!

23:37.082 --> 23:38.618
[dramatic music]

23:38.709 --> 23:40.792
[Toad laughs]

23:42.838 --> 23:44.249
Blimey, it's cold.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.922
That's why I wore me mittens.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.466
Huh? Hit men don't wear mittens!

23:48.552 --> 23:50.509
Take them off! You're embarrassing me.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.134
Well, it's all right for you.
You've got little hands.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.089
- Got it!
- [Whitey] They don't get as cold.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.642
- I ain't got little hands!
- [Whitey] Yeah, you have.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.344
[Whitey] You've got lady's hands.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.806
Well, they might be small,
but they're lethal weapons, these.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.766
You've got your mother's hands.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.818
[chains clang]

24:05.820 --> 24:08.152
Right. Put your hands together.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.109
[groaning] You could have wiped your feet.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.444
- Stop squirming!
- Oh!

24:18.958 --> 24:22.372
- [alarm rings]
- Goodbye, vermin.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.171
[air whooshes]

24:27.675 --> 24:31.965
Now, let me see the latest
addition to my cubist collection.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.014
- What? Impossible!
- [Rita] Oi! Kermit!

24:39.645 --> 24:43.980
The prize returns to me! [smooches]

24:44.066 --> 24:46.524
You big, fat, slimy airbag!

24:46.610 --> 24:49.603
[growling] After them!

24:49.697 --> 24:51.063
[thuds]

24:51.615 --> 24:53.698
Why are you stopping?
Don't we have a plan?

24:53.784 --> 24:55.241
"We"? Who's "we"?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.410
Wait, wait, wait.
You can't just leave me here!

24:57.496 --> 25:00.079
Faster, you idiots! They're escaping!

25:00.165 --> 25:02.031
- [clangs]
- [groaning]

25:04.003 --> 25:06.245
Oh! Oh...

25:06.755 --> 25:10.339
[energetic music]

25:10.426 --> 25:12.213
[groaning]

25:12.302 --> 25:15.295
[machines power down]

25:15.389 --> 25:18.302
[Toad] No! Not the master cable!

25:18.392 --> 25:20.850
- We have a plan?
- Put that back!

25:21.603 --> 25:23.890
Wait, wait!
That will never hold both of us.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.722
You're right. Toodle-oo.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.227
No, no, wait!

25:27.317 --> 25:28.728
F-f-f-freeze!

25:30.029 --> 25:31.941
Ah! [grunts]

25:32.031 --> 25:33.693
Oh, no!

25:34.199 --> 25:35.565
No, no, no, no, don't break!

25:35.659 --> 25:38.026
There are things I want to do,
sights I want to see!

25:39.455 --> 25:41.788
- That wasn't on the list.
- Aah! Hey!

25:41.874 --> 25:45.618
- [Roddy yells]
- [thuds]

25:45.711 --> 25:47.247
- Do something!
- [gasps]

25:47.337 --> 25:50.956
- [cracks]
- Huh? Whoa. Ow!

25:51.050 --> 25:53.212
- [groaning]
- [inhales deeply]

25:54.178 --> 25:55.760
[both scream]

25:55.846 --> 25:58.589
Keep your legs straight
when you hit the water!

25:59.975 --> 26:02.262
[water splashes]

26:03.312 --> 26:05.850
- I kept me legs straight, Spike.
- Ow.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.396
- [bashes]
- Ow.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.146
[panting] Oh, good grief, that's high.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.318
Quite high. Rather high.
So very, very high.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.986
Hmm.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.858
Hmm. Yeah.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.443
Cool.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.823
See ya!

26:21.914 --> 26:23.405
[grunts]

26:25.834 --> 26:27.450
[tap creaking]

26:27.628 --> 26:29.164
[groans]

26:30.923 --> 26:35.042
[playful music]

26:39.932 --> 26:42.640
Oh... If she can do it...

26:43.268 --> 26:44.600
Here goes.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.312
Ah. Ah! No!

26:49.149 --> 26:52.517
[chuckles] Ah!

26:52.611 --> 26:54.523
- [crunching]
- Oh!

26:55.197 --> 26:56.779
- [crunching]
- [whimpers]

26:57.407 --> 26:59.615
- [crunching]
- Ahh!

26:59.701 --> 27:01.158
[grunts]

27:01.453 --> 27:03.786
And gently down.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.244
Oh!

27:07.334 --> 27:09.667
- My ball, too.
- It's my ball, too!

27:09.753 --> 27:12.336
- It's my ball, too!
- Rita? Rita!

27:16.426 --> 27:18.884
Oh, where is she? Rita!

27:18.971 --> 27:21.679
- Ah!
- Target's at twelve o'clock!

27:22.141 --> 27:23.257
Oh, come on!

27:24.059 --> 27:25.800
[crashes]

27:27.104 --> 27:29.892
Careful, Whitey. That's a banana skin.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.937
- Rita!
- Whew. Over there!

27:38.490 --> 27:40.482
[squealing]

27:43.370 --> 27:46.238
- [Roddy pants]
- [horn blaring]

27:46.999 --> 27:48.206
[horn blaring]

27:48.292 --> 27:53.128
Ah! Whoa! Oh.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.830
[Spike laughing]

27:56.633 --> 27:59.296
You look pretty ridiculous now, Millicent.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.255
Ahh!

28:04.349 --> 28:06.011
Keep your legs straight!

28:06.101 --> 28:07.637
- [thuds]
- [grunts, moans]

28:08.770 --> 28:10.762
Oh...

28:13.442 --> 28:17.277
- [Rita gasps]
- [Roddy yelps]

28:17.362 --> 28:20.275
What are you, some kind of rat boomerang?

28:20.365 --> 28:23.028
- Give me back my ruby!
- I haven't got your ruby!

28:23.118 --> 28:24.859
- [bell dings]
- [Rita gasps]

28:27.039 --> 28:30.282
Okay. Well, now I've got your ruby.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.661
[Rita gasps]

28:32.294 --> 28:34.957
- [Rita groans]
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.463
Please be careful.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.293
That ruby means a lot to me.
It's priceless!

28:41.386 --> 28:42.593
Hold on.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.804
- It's a fake.
- [Rita tittering]

28:44.890 --> 28:46.802
No, it's blooming not. It's real!

28:46.892 --> 28:48.758
No, no, no, look, it's just glass.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.263
- It's real!
- Fake.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.016
- Real! Real!
- Fake. Fake.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.065
- Real!
- Fake.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.147
- Real, real.
- Fake, fake.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.645
- Real!
- Look, look, look, look.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.976
You can tell. Watch this.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.778
- [glass shatters]
- [shrieks]

29:00.864 --> 29:02.230
[Rita shudders]

29:02.324 --> 29:04.657
There, you see?
I mean, you can't break a real ruby.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.110
[Rita growls]

29:07.204 --> 29:09.742
Right. I probably
shouldn't have done that.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.289
Uh, but look on the bright side.
I've saved your neck.

29:12.376 --> 29:15.585
I mean, once The Toad knows it's
worthless, he'll stop chasing you for it.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.503
Roddy St. James saves the day.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.670
- [Rita grunts]
- [punches]

29:19.549 --> 29:21.381
- Oh!
- [crashes]

29:22.594 --> 29:24.051
[Roddy] Good grief!

29:24.137 --> 29:26.174
You try to do somebody
a favor, and they... Ow!

29:26.265 --> 29:31.511
A favor? That ruby was from
Queen Elizabeth's crown!

29:31.603 --> 29:34.186
It fell down the drain
of Buckingham Palace!

29:34.273 --> 29:36.890
Well, maybe the Queen wears fake jewelry.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.691
Keep still!

29:38.777 --> 29:40.359
Can we just talk about this?

29:40.445 --> 29:44.689
Real or not, that ruby
was gonna change my life!

29:44.783 --> 29:47.025
- [line rings]
- [man] <i>Han Chin Chinese takeout.</i>

29:47.119 --> 29:49.611
Yes, I'm being attacked by a madwoman.
She's got crayons!

29:49.705 --> 29:52.573
- [man] <i>One chicken chow mein. With wonton?</i>
- No, crayons!

29:52.666 --> 29:55.158
[man] <i>No wonton! You want rice?
Fried or white?</i>

29:55.252 --> 29:58.290
- Um, fried. No, wait!
- [man] <i>You want wonton or what?</i>

29:58.630 --> 30:00.792
- Uh, cancel that order.
- [telephone beeps]

30:01.466 --> 30:04.584
- Rita?
- Just go away, please.

30:05.512 --> 30:06.673
Um...

30:08.348 --> 30:12.308
- I'm sorry.
- [scoffs] Sorry?

30:13.020 --> 30:15.512
Me and my dad worked
these drains for years.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.308
He broke every bone in his body
trying to get that ruby.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.978
[sighs] It was going to be
the answer to all our prayers.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.739
And now, it turns out
it was a stupid fake.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.068
Well...

30:30.787 --> 30:32.574
Maybe I can make it up to you.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.031
- Get stuffed.
- No, no, no, I mean it.

30:35.125 --> 30:38.960
See, back at my place, we've got a jewelry
box crammed with rubies and diamonds.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.753
Real ones. So...

30:40.839 --> 30:44.003
All you have to do is get me home
to Kensington...

30:44.801 --> 30:48.135
and I'll make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.004
[exhales deeply]

30:51.016 --> 30:54.430
How do I know this ain't
just a load of old rubbish?

30:54.519 --> 30:57.728
Well, I suppose you'll
just have to trust me.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.520
I must be out of my mind.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.360
All right. You've got yourself a deal.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.771
[spits]

31:08.700 --> 31:10.987
Go on. You too.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.537
- [hawks]
- Your own hand.

31:15.749 --> 31:16.910
[clears throat]

31:17.000 --> 31:19.583
- [spits]
- [squishing]

31:21.588 --> 31:23.796
[uplifting music]

31:25.592 --> 31:27.959
Where are those idiots?

31:28.053 --> 31:30.966
It's so hard to get
good help these days, my boys.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.679
Yes, that's right.
Oh, come on out, my lovelies.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.976
Cheer your old dad up.

31:37.479 --> 31:43.942
Poor Daddy, surrounded by filthy rats
in this joyless, sunless void!

31:44.569 --> 31:46.856
But don't worry, little men.

31:46.947 --> 31:50.315
Daddy will get rid of them all! He will.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.822
- They'll all be deady-weady.
- [murmuring]

31:52.911 --> 31:56.120
[smooches]

31:56.206 --> 31:58.118
- [chuckles]
- Mwah.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.494
Did you find it?

31:59.584 --> 32:02.247
- Huh?
- Ach! Did you find it?

32:02.337 --> 32:05.830
Ah... well, we got most of it, boss.

32:06.758 --> 32:11.002
Forget the ruby!
It's the master cable that I want.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.672
The one that grubby creature Rita took.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.972
[both] Oh.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.641
- Without it, my plan is ruined!
- [Whitey] Ow.

32:17.727 --> 32:21.016
Oh, okay, chief. Yeah.
Forget the ruby. Ruby's gone.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.222
Woo-hoo!

32:22.315 --> 32:26.184
Yeah, see? You see? Moving on.
We are now your cable guys.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.021
Focused. Cable-centric, boss.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.532
You need to be back in time
for the World Cup Final.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.576
Oh, great! Are we watching
the game together, boss?

32:36.288 --> 32:39.122
- [Toad] Just get the cable!
- [Spike screams]

32:39.207 --> 32:40.869
[Whitey] Keep your legs straight!

32:40.959 --> 32:41.995
[thuds]

32:42.085 --> 32:44.543
Should we be stopping
with all those goons on our tail?

32:44.629 --> 32:46.871
[Rita] We aren't gonna get far
without a map, are we?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.376
[creaking]

32:48.467 --> 32:53.462
- [Roddy] Is that a house?
- [Rita] Yes, and it's very dangerous.

32:53.555 --> 32:54.716
- So...
- [Roddy screams]

32:54.806 --> 32:56.047
...why don't you wait here?

32:56.141 --> 32:57.973
Waiting here. Excellent idea.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.176
- Watch out for the piranha.
- [Roddy yelps]

33:01.605 --> 33:04.564
- [children] Rita!
- [Roddy hollers]

33:06.067 --> 33:08.935
[kids chattering]

33:09.779 --> 33:11.896
Here you go, Annie. For you, too, Shamus.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.607
Mimi, get your finger
out of your nose. Fergus.

33:14.701 --> 33:18.035
- Yes, Jojo, no biting.
- [boy] That is wild good!

33:18.121 --> 33:19.908
[all] Rita!

33:20.707 --> 33:23.040
[kids shouting]

33:23.543 --> 33:24.909
Rita's back!

33:25.003 --> 33:27.746
- Oh, Rita!
- Mum! Oh, Mum.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.546
Thank goodness you're safe.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.836
Rita!

33:35.347 --> 33:38.090
- Hello, Dad.
- Give us a hug, girl!

33:38.183 --> 33:40.596
Whoa! Oh!

33:42.437 --> 33:44.019
- [all grunt]
- [cup shattering]

33:45.023 --> 33:47.436
Oi, Mum, there's a peeping Tom outside!

33:47.526 --> 33:51.145
Tom? Ohh, it's Tom Jones!

33:51.571 --> 33:53.779
Mother, it's not Tom Jones.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.822
That's just my passenger.

33:55.909 --> 33:59.949
- Oh, he's very good-looking.
- He is not coming in.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.286
- [Mum] Soup's on!
- [groans]

34:04.376 --> 34:06.493
[boy] It's lovely. Thanks, Mum.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.250
[kids clamoring]

34:12.050 --> 34:13.460
[grunts]

34:13.552 --> 34:15.965
So how long have you been
Rita's boyfriend?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.637
- He is not my boyfriend.
- [blows raspberry]

34:18.723 --> 34:21.466
So, are you gonna make
an honest woman of my daughter?

34:21.560 --> 34:22.926
Dad!

34:23.018 --> 34:26.228
Well, we were thinking of a spring
wedding, weren't we, cream puff?

34:26.313 --> 34:28.772
Look, I just want
all of you to know he's...

34:28.858 --> 34:31.440
- Tom Jones!
- [sighs]
