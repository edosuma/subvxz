WEBVTT

00:07.676 --> 00:10.762
Grandma's got some cash.
We could steal that.

00:11.888 --> 00:13.723
What kind of creep
are you?

00:13.848 --> 00:16.476
We steal from strangers.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.395
Hey, Grandma's not
gonna call the cops.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.771
Look.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.774
Either you start doing this,
or you get a job.

00:26.695 --> 00:27.862
That guy.

00:29.572 --> 00:33.326
You're gonna remember that guy
for the rest of your life.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.213
Hey. How you doing?

00:49.134 --> 00:51.386
I said...
Hey, give me all your cash!

00:54.389 --> 00:55.515
Why?

00:56.850 --> 00:59.644
You want to buy yourself a pretty dress,
you little bitch?

01:00.186 --> 01:03.648
- He ain't kidding, man.
- Where's your wallet?

01:03.773 --> 01:07.485
On your sister's nightstand.
I forgot it after I paid her.

01:08.528 --> 01:10.155
- Whoa, Tony...
- You want to die tonight?

01:10.280 --> 01:12.782
I said
where's your wallet?

01:13.575 --> 01:15.243
(COUGHING)

01:16.119 --> 01:16.953
I think he's sick.
Maybe you shouldn't.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.037
He's faking.

01:18.163 --> 01:21.249
Look, go in his pockets.
Grab his wallet.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.796
(WHEEZING)

01:27.505 --> 01:28.840
Good. Let's go.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.175
(COUGHING)

01:32.051 --> 01:33.052
You all right, man?

01:33.178 --> 01:35.472
He's fine.
He's faking it.

01:35.597 --> 01:36.973
(COUGHING CONTINUES)

01:37.849 --> 01:38.767
(DIALING)

01:41.644 --> 01:43.938
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at Maple and Fourth.

01:44.564 --> 01:47.108
There's a really sick guy.
I think he got mugged.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.736
- What?
- Are you happy? Let's go!

02:26.773 --> 02:31.736
Today, we're hunting for
the cat burglar of diseases.

02:31.861 --> 02:35.198
Causes a healthy man's lungs to fail,
but leaves no fingerprints.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.075
Respiratory distress,
could be asthma.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.451
No hyperinflation
on the x-ray.

02:38.785 --> 02:40.954
Food allergy. Could have eaten
shellfish or peanuts.

02:41.079 --> 02:43.206
No hives.
No erythema on the skin.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.333
Pulmonary embolism.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.961
Embolisms don't
magically dissolve.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.128
What are you doing here?

02:49.254 --> 02:50.463
Laryngospasm..

02:50.588 --> 02:52.340
Frosty fall air
hits his vocal cords,

02:52.465 --> 02:55.134
they spasm shut,
choke him out.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.971
Good idea. You've been
tremendously helpful.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.305
- You can leave.
- I just hired him.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.099
Well, I fired him.
To infinity.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.642
You didn't tell him
I was coming back?

03:02.934 --> 03:04.519
She did.
I said no.

03:04.644 --> 03:07.689
When your extended
job interview slash reality TV show

03:07.814 --> 03:08.857
killed a patient,

03:08.982 --> 03:10.859
you lost
your veto power.

03:10.984 --> 03:12.944
Everybody,
this is Dr. Foreman. He will...

03:13.069 --> 03:15.905
Does this mean
there's one less slot for us?

03:18.908 --> 03:21.119
It's still
Dr. House's department.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.413
He decides who stays,
who goes...

03:23.538 --> 03:24.414
Foreman goes.

03:24.706 --> 03:28.835
But Dr. Foreman
will be my eyes and ears.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.546
You do nothing
without his knowledge.

03:33.590 --> 03:34.591
Oh!

03:34.841 --> 03:36.050
Just in case I need them

03:36.175 --> 03:39.554
where exactly will Dr. Foreman
be keeping my balls?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.809
If you wanna keep your jobs,
that never happened.

03:44.934 --> 03:47.937
The only way to get the cat burglar is
to catch him in the act.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.898
Give the patient
a methacholine challenge.

03:50.023 --> 03:51.649
See if it sets off
laryngospasm.

03:51.774 --> 03:52.859
You want us to
stop his breathing?

03:53.109 --> 03:54.694
Well, only until
you can figure out why.

03:54.819 --> 03:57.530
After that,
it would be irresponsible.

04:01.576 --> 04:03.578
You and I should talk.

04:04.704 --> 04:05.830
I'm sorry.

04:05.955 --> 04:06.831
She didn't have
to do that publicly.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.041
Yes, she did.

04:08.166 --> 04:12.128
She had to establish her dominance
in front of them. Limit my power.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.047
There's nothing
we can do.

04:14.172 --> 04:17.008
Well, that's not
the never-say-never Dr. Foreman I know.

04:17.133 --> 04:18.092
There's lots we can do.

04:18.217 --> 04:19.218
Not really, Cuddy...

04:19.344 --> 04:21.971
I can make
you miserable.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.264
That's true.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.808
Until you quit. Again.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.477
So, why don't we just
skip the middleman?

04:27.602 --> 04:28.728
I'm not quitting.

04:28.853 --> 04:33.650
My God. Not everything's about you and
your little job and your little world.

04:33.775 --> 04:36.027
This is about restoring
order in the universe.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.153
I'm not quitting.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.864
You're gonna
be miserable.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.991
I already am miserable.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.042
Cuddy obviously thinks
we're idiots.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.044
She's not gonna let
House hire any one of us.

04:53.169 --> 04:56.464
Tidal volume's holding at 1.2 liters.
Increase the dose.

04:56.589 --> 04:57.966
So, which master
do we serve?

04:58.091 --> 04:59.842
Whose ass
do we have to kiss to get this job?

04:59.968 --> 05:02.011
You really want
this job so bad?

05:02.136 --> 05:04.097
How about you
try doing this job?

05:04.222 --> 05:07.058
Double the dose
to 16 milligrams per milliliter.

05:08.393 --> 05:10.395
My foot's tingling.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.896
Is that normal?

05:12.021 --> 05:13.898
No.
What exactly does it...

05:14.023 --> 05:16.234
And my stomach's
killing me.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.778
Could this test
cause that stuff?

05:18.903 --> 05:19.988
No.

05:23.825 --> 05:24.993
Test was a bust.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.953
Amber has moved
down to even money.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.663
We found
two new symptoms.

05:28.788 --> 05:30.456
Yep.
Back to two to one.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.542
- What's going on?
- You're the favorite.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.669
- House's?
- To get fired.

05:35.962 --> 05:39.048
You can bet against yourself.
Lovely parting gift.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.050
- What's the limit?
- Isn't one.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.468
Five hundred
on Kutner.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.345
A thousand on Amber.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.180
Do you take checks?

05:46.305 --> 05:47.390
No.

05:50.476 --> 05:55.106
How do we connect abdominal pain and
numbness in the extremities

05:55.231 --> 05:56.274
with respiratory collapse?

05:56.399 --> 05:58.443
Dissecting
aortic aneurysm.

05:58.568 --> 06:00.987
Doesn't cover all three.
What else?

06:02.905 --> 06:05.158
Carry on.
He's the boss.

06:10.705 --> 06:12.999
What about
a spinal cord lesion?

06:13.124 --> 06:14.042
Would have to be
in the brain stem.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.501
It still doesn't
explain the lungs.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.503
Weird, though.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.047
That he's the boss.

06:19.172 --> 06:21.799
Didn't he quit recently?
Was it a money issue?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.468
Lungs, stomach,
numbness...

06:23.593 --> 06:25.011
No, that wasn't it.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.597
It was something else.

06:27.722 --> 06:31.350
Was it bling account? Med plan didn't
cover tattoo removal?

06:31.476 --> 06:33.061
We have to unify
these symptoms.

06:33.186 --> 06:35.563
I remember.

06:35.688 --> 06:37.565
You didn't want to
turn into me. Right?

06:37.690 --> 06:39.400
You didn't want
to become evil.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.152
Can we stick to
the medicine, here?

06:41.277 --> 06:42.320
Absolutely.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.988
I'm just flattered.

06:44.113 --> 06:48.993
In a few short weeks, seems like I've
just turned towards the light.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.620
Either that,
or you sold your soul.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.038
Multiple marantic
emboli could...

06:52.163 --> 06:54.207
Did you get a raise?

06:54.332 --> 06:55.666
Because then
you're a whore.

06:55.792 --> 06:58.544
Or didn't you?
Because then, you're a stupid whore.

06:58.669 --> 06:59.962
(BEEPER BEEPS)

07:00.088 --> 07:02.006
Patient just crashed.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.260
Can they go, boss?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.104
- You're right.
- But?

07:16.229 --> 07:19.732
No but.
You're right about all of it.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.067
Then, I'll see you
at the reunion.

07:21.317 --> 07:24.112
Seems I didn't get out
of here soon enough.

07:24.237 --> 07:28.658
The world thinks I've been corrupted,
so no one will hire me.

07:28.783 --> 07:33.704
I hate being here.
I'd love to quit, but I can't.

07:48.219 --> 07:49.262
He's got a pulse.

07:49.387 --> 07:50.596
Must be another
respiratory collapse.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.140
Means this is our chance
to prove laryngospasm.

07:52.265 --> 07:54.142
- We need to tube him and bag him.
- We will. Right after we...

07:54.267 --> 07:55.768
If we just let him die,
it doesn't matter what he has.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.770
Brennan, tilt his head
back so I can get a straight shot.

07:57.895 --> 08:01.816
AMBER: Okay. While you're killing him,
I'll get the intubation kit.

08:05.361 --> 08:09.073
I decided you're right. You're obviously
in an impossible position.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.950
There's no point
in me humiliating you.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.076
Thanks.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.703
So, I'm gonna
humiliate Cuddy.

08:13.828 --> 08:15.163
Until she fires you.

08:15.288 --> 08:18.249
Guy's faking.
It's Munchausen's.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.459
You notice the EMT
run sheet?

08:20.585 --> 08:23.379
Paramedic who brought him
in is also named Martin Harris.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.678
If the name was
Attila Von Wienerschnitzel,

08:30.803 --> 08:31.762
I'd say you might be
onto something.

08:31.888 --> 08:34.265
Look, room 406,
abdominal pain,

08:34.390 --> 08:37.894
room 403,
left-sided numbness, 402, syncope.

08:39.729 --> 08:41.647
He's copying his
neighbors' symptoms.

08:45.318 --> 08:46.402
- No.
- Yeah.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.113
Coincidence is much more
likely than you being a stubborn jerk.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.657
Munchausen's patients
create symptoms, not names.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.201
Munchausen's patients
have medical histories

08:53.326 --> 08:55.703
they don't want
us reading.

08:55.828 --> 08:56.954
TAUB: No laryngeal spasm.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.248
Breathing's resumed
normal rate, without intubation.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.209
You see?
Nothing's wrong with him.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.044
He's in a lab coat.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.882
Munchausens pretend
to be patients, not doctors.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.844
He's got Mirror Syndrome.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.471
Giovannini's?

09:13.596 --> 09:16.641
Do you know another
Mirror Syndrome?

09:16.766 --> 09:20.102
Brain's got no idea
who he is, where he is, what he is,

09:20.228 --> 09:22.939
so it fills the holes
with whatever dirt's lying around.

09:23.064 --> 09:25.191
He reads a name tag,
he's got a name.

09:25.316 --> 09:28.402
Sees a doctor, he's got a job.
Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.987
FOREMAN:
My explanation's simpler.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.657
Well, if it's simple,
then we discharge the nutbar,

09:32.782 --> 09:35.952
but if it's complicated,
then the nutbar has got brain damage.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.746
So, we let him jerk them around
for a few days till we're sure?

09:38.871 --> 09:41.332
No. We let him
jerk you around.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.044
There's a faster way.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.926
Mind if we play through?

09:52.051 --> 09:55.137
Sure. What could
possibly go wrong?

09:55.263 --> 09:57.682
What's going on here,
Martin?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.310
- Operation?
- House?

10:01.435 --> 10:02.478
Who is this guy?

10:02.603 --> 10:04.272
HOUSE: Excellent question.

10:04.397 --> 10:06.315
Who are you, Martin?

10:10.111 --> 10:13.322
He just likes to
watch and do stuff.

10:14.365 --> 10:17.159
WILSON: Number 10 scalpel
for initial incision.

10:19.996 --> 10:21.622
Glad you're here, House.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.499
Of course you are.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.458
It's lecture time.

10:24.709 --> 10:25.835
WILSON: Yeah. It is.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.629
Stop worrying
about the power play.

10:29.797 --> 10:33.009
Was that it? I think you can go
a lot deeper, here.

10:33.134 --> 10:35.803
I mean, why am I so obsessed
by all of this?

10:35.928 --> 10:38.931
You're threatened by Foreman
and feel the need to impress Cuddy.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.017
The only thing that's relevant
is Foreman is a good doctor.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.226
He can help you.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.186
- Lighten the load.
- Good idea.

10:44.312 --> 10:46.522
I'll have him
sort my mail.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.774
Sure.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.027
Deflect.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.739
Who is this guy?

10:54.864 --> 10:55.948
I think
we just found out.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.576
It's all about Cuddy.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.037
You've got to be
the alpha dog.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.789
You can almost smell
the pheromones now, huh?

11:04.165 --> 11:05.708
I like him.

11:08.753 --> 11:11.255
- Told you I didn't need you.
- House!

11:17.053 --> 11:18.929
House, what is going on?

11:21.849 --> 11:22.850
Ow!

11:25.895 --> 11:28.856
Your blood's
turned to sludge.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.567
If we don't heat you up,
you're gonna die.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.235
Can't fake that!

11:38.324 --> 11:42.161
Mirror Syndrome patients
have no agenda, no ax to grind.

11:42.286 --> 11:43.996
They can read you
because they have to.

11:44.121 --> 11:47.708
Moods, attitudes, everything.
They're like mind readers.

11:47.833 --> 11:48.959
Except they can
read your mind.

11:49.085 --> 11:49.919
Where are we going?

11:50.044 --> 11:51.504
Unfortunately,
we have to cure him.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.172
His hand wasn't black
when he came in.

11:53.464 --> 11:54.757
The operating room
was sterile.

11:54.924 --> 11:57.385
Only thing different was the
temperature. Cold agglutinins means...

11:57.510 --> 11:58.928
It's gotta be some
kind of infection.

11:59.053 --> 12:01.180
No fever, so it's gotta
be a tiny infection, hard to find.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.556
And you better
find it fast.

12:02.723 --> 12:07.645
This guy feels another cool breeze, his
blood turns to slop and he drops.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.064
I need three ways
to pinpoint infection.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.065
Blood cultures.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.942
Blood's clumpy.
Nothing you can do with it.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.403
Unless we soak him
in warm water before we draw it.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.071
Good. What else?

12:17.196 --> 12:18.948
Ultrasound his abdomen.
Look for an abscess.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.575
Good.
Ladies and gentlemen?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.828
I have a regrettable
announcement.

12:23.953 --> 12:24.995
Kitchen has just learned

12:25.121 --> 12:27.832
that our annual shipment
of mayonnaise was improperly stored,

12:27.957 --> 12:30.960
so anybody who ate,
well, the food

12:31.085 --> 12:33.462
should head across
the lobby to the clinic right away.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.089
Ask for Dr. Cuddy.

12:36.340 --> 12:39.176
You're not punishing Cuddy. You're
punishing every doctor in the building.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.929
It's her building.
Her doctors. Still need one more.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.013
Well, we need to
find out his history.

12:43.139 --> 12:44.265
Where he's been,
what he's done.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.768
Yeah. He has no memory,
but his bio's tattooed to his rear?

12:47.893 --> 12:50.813
The mayo is fine. You can stay
where you are. I'm a doctor.

12:51.021 --> 12:55.192
Mail order. I've seen the diploma.
There's two N's in University.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.404
Big Love was right.
History is the key.

12:58.612 --> 13:03.617
No ID, no wallet, no missing person's
report filed for 100 miles...

13:03.742 --> 13:05.077
The key is the key.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.163
He had car keys in his pocket
when he was admitted.

13:07.288 --> 13:08.372
Keep him in
the isolation room

13:08.497 --> 13:11.667
so he doesn't pick up Extreme Bitch
Syndrome from one of the nurses.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.085
Run the ultrasound
and the blood cultures.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.628
The cultures
were my idea.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.006
No one's keeping score.

13:17.131 --> 13:18.048
You're losing.

13:18.174 --> 13:21.302
Search the street where he was mugged.
Find the car and the registration.

13:21.427 --> 13:23.471
There could be
thousands of cars.

13:23.596 --> 13:24.763
Hey, why do
I get this assignment?

13:24.889 --> 13:26.474
Because,
if you deal with the patient,

13:26.599 --> 13:29.935
he's gonna wind up singing Osmond songs
and proposing to five nurses at once.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.937
I'll go with Cole.

13:32.062 --> 13:32.938
Ooh!

13:33.063 --> 13:35.191
We have a love connection.

13:38.444 --> 13:39.820
Make a fist.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.907
Little pinch.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.993
Wow.
That's a strong pinch.

13:46.118 --> 13:49.663
This thing works.
You're lucky you've got me.

13:50.039 --> 13:53.125
My colleague
wanted to cook you in boiling water.

13:56.879 --> 14:00.216
That's right, baby.
My blood's that good.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.472
That's supposed to
be me, right?

14:06.597 --> 14:07.640
No.

14:07.765 --> 14:09.642
That's me.
I'm always right. Gotta be.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.185
I don't think I'm always...

14:11.310 --> 14:16.190
If they don't like you, you've gotta be
right, or you're not worth anything.

14:20.986 --> 14:24.657
Infections can hide
deep beneath the skin.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.700
This will find them.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.744
Who was that
last doctor?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.957
Dr. Amber Volakis.

14:33.082 --> 14:35.042
Don't really
need her name.

14:38.796 --> 14:41.632
Wait.
You saying that you...

14:42.800 --> 14:44.885
I want her?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.930
Don't know what you want.
Don't care what you want.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.265
I'm married.

14:49.390 --> 14:50.933
So am I.

14:51.058 --> 14:56.063
Even if I wasn't, she's a little
too aggressive for me.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.440
Hey.

14:58.566 --> 15:01.277
Aggressive is
never a bad thing.

15:04.572 --> 15:06.156
Yeah. True.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.457
I'm done.

15:16.917 --> 15:17.751
You Okay?

15:17.876 --> 15:18.877
Yeah.

15:19.003 --> 15:21.672
We've gotta run
some more tests.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.092
You can clean
yourself up.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.263
HOUSE:
Lesion on the liver.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.307
- Cystic or solid?
- Solid.

15:31.432 --> 15:33.851
Well, you certainly
did the right thing by coming to me.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.020
Yes.
I needed a smug oncologist to...

15:36.145 --> 15:37.563
An authoritative
oncologist.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.607
I hate you.
Tell me why.

15:39.732 --> 15:42.776
I've been scanning literature.
Very interesting study in Sweden.

15:42.901 --> 15:46.614
Apparently, Giovannini's patients mimic
whoever they think's in charge.

15:46.739 --> 15:49.908
Any country with that low an age of
consent and that high a rate of suicide

15:50.034 --> 15:51.368
isn't thinking straight.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.954
I am in charge
of our relationship.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.999
It was a surgery. You were the surgeon.
In that setting...

15:57.249 --> 15:59.627
You would pick up my laundry
if I asked you to.

15:59.835 --> 16:00.794
Go ahead. Ask.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.088
I wouldn't do
that to you.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.146
I want all my personal
private doctors back right now!

16:19.980 --> 16:20.814
Except for Foreman.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.816
Your team,
Foreman included,

16:22.941 --> 16:26.779
is dealing with
the Great Mayonnaise Panic of 2007.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.824
Frankly, I'm worried it might spread
to other continents.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.831
Lesion on the liver.
Possibility.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.876
Why are you doing a pelvic
for food poisoning?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.045
She said her
hoo-hoo burned.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.259
Lesion on the liver.
Ideas?

16:49.385 --> 16:51.303
Start with a biopsy
to rule out cancer.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.388
KUTNER:
Could be an abscess.

16:52.596 --> 16:53.806
Needle works
for that, too.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.974
Well, unless it's
a vascular hemangioma.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.893
Aspirate that,
and he'll bleed out, we'll kill him.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.437
If he bleeds out,
we know what he had.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.314
Had?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.024
Two diagnoses out
of three, he lives.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.901
We do nothing,
three out of three he dies.

17:06.026 --> 17:06.860
Go stick his liver.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.112
TAUB: Where's Foreman?
We should...

17:08.237 --> 17:10.364
You need him
to draft your letter of resignation?

17:10.489 --> 17:12.449
You risking our patient's life
to get back at Cuddy?

17:12.616 --> 17:15.077
What? No. That would
be childish.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.079
This is what I'm doing
to get back at Cuddy.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.374
Who here doesn't
have any health insurance?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.793
Michael Moore was right.

17:22.918 --> 17:27.923
MRIs, PET scans, neuropsych tests,
private rooms for all these patients.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.341
Fight the power!

17:31.301 --> 17:32.720
(GROANS)

17:33.887 --> 17:36.807
Sorry. I missed.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.810
I have to reposition
the needle.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.438
You're gonna feel
another pinch.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.065
You still with me?

17:45.482 --> 17:46.525
I'm here.

17:47.776 --> 17:48.861
You feeling faint?

17:48.986 --> 17:49.987
No.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.238
What's wrong?

17:51.363 --> 17:52.823
It's personal.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.827
You got personal problems?
You got no memory.

17:56.952 --> 18:01.832
I'm in a hospital. I don't want
to be in a hospital.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.839
You're sick, so...

18:08.964 --> 18:10.007
I'm bored.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.264
You ask what's wrong,
then you ignore the answer.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.892
Just go on
with what you're doing.

18:22.186 --> 18:23.937
You think
everything's okay

18:24.062 --> 18:27.691
as long as you don't think about it,
don't deal with it.

18:30.903 --> 18:33.030
Is that blood?

18:33.155 --> 18:35.115
I think it's pus
from a fungus.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.992
I have fungus in me?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.870
If you've been in the tropics
in the last few months.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.289
I saw this in
tsunami survivors.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.542
Their skin grafts would ooze black pus
sometimes weeks later.

18:45.667 --> 18:49.254
Traced the fungus back to the sand
in the tsunami tides.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.965
That's so cool.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.221
BRENNAN:
I think the black pus is fungal.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.973
If I'm right, that's where
the cold agglutinins are coming from.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.100
That's what's driving
his memory loss.

19:02.226 --> 19:05.854
Amber's putting
him on amphotericin. It will cure him.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.106
This makes no sense.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.484
I'm doing blood tests to be sure,
but the sooner we get him on...

19:10.609 --> 19:12.736
I'm not talking
about the infection.

19:12.861 --> 19:17.574
I'm talking about you letting Tonya
Harding administer the treatment.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.618
- I'm out of the game.
- Why?

19:19.743 --> 19:21.787
A couple of weeks ago,
you named me Grumpy.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.748
Said I didn't want to be here,
wanted to be back in the third world...

19:24.873 --> 19:26.625
And you realized
I'm right just now?

19:26.834 --> 19:28.669
I got a confirmation.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.337
The patient's nuts.

19:30.546 --> 19:33.590
The patient's unbiased.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.969
- The patient has no ax to grind.
- The patient is nuts.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.720
I miss my old life.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.181
Helping people
who barely have clean water,

19:41.306 --> 19:43.892
let alone the kind
of medicines we waste by the SUV-load.

19:44.017 --> 19:49.022
You're nuts. You're gonna be miserable
at home, at work, somewhere.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.733
The goal in life
is not to eliminate misery.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.652
It's to keep misery
to the minimum.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.737
Now, that's inspiring.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.448
You said you came back
to get married.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.741
What does
your fiancée do?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.326
She's a court reporter.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.705
Uh-huh. Well, I'm sure
Thailand will have courts any day, now.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.836
Someone's gonna be
miserable sometime. Accept it.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.213
That's how
I stay so happy.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.925
Why do you care
if I stay?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.385
You're good.

20:18.719 --> 20:22.014
Don't screw it up
just because you're miserable.

20:25.267 --> 20:29.730
I'm gonna stay
until the patient's cured,

20:31.648 --> 20:33.984
which should be
in about an hour.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.868
- You okay?
- Not okay.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.453
Which one of us
is he mirroring?

20:44.578 --> 20:48.916
Well, if it was you, he'd be inflicting
pain on someone else, so...

20:49.833 --> 20:52.336
I'd say he's mimicking
whichever one of us happens to be dying.

(GROANING)

20:58.091 --> 20:59.885
KUTNER:The heating blanket wasn't
keeping him warm enough.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.179
Ordered a whirlpool,
got his blood flowing.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.972
So far, it's keeping
his rash at bay.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.309
Rash worse equals
cold agglutinins worse.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.853
Means what was in
his liver wasn't fungus.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.396
Yeah. Labs confirmed...

21:11.563 --> 21:12.439
That it wasn't
even pus.

21:12.606 --> 21:15.359
It was just coagulated
blood caused by the cold agglutinins.

21:15.484 --> 21:20.072
Which you mistook for a cool fungus
that you saw after the tsunami.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.240
- Same consistency as...
- You saw what you wanted to see.

21:22.366 --> 21:23.951
Not what was there.

21:24.076 --> 21:26.578
Wait a second.
Didn't you quit?

21:26.703 --> 21:29.039
I spoke to my fiancée.
I'm staying.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.666
Of course you are.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.460
Because you're the exact
right amount of miserable.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.171
Broad spectrum antibiotics
aren't working.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.048
It's got to be viral
or exotic bacteria.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.883
There are
a thousand microbes it could be.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.010
We could repeat all cultures.
Maybe we just missed it.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.805
Or we could get
an accurate history.

You know how to kill dogs, right?

to repeating all the cultures.

accurate history.

out that possibility?

any of my metaphors, yet?

only it calls them antibodies.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.451
We find out what diseases
he's had in his life,

22:47.576 --> 22:51.079
good chance that'll tell us
where he's been in his life.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.790
Alice.
Your turn through the looking glass.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.000
I raw blood and ' F.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.047
He)!' guys.

23:00.172 --> 23:02.632
I haven't signed off
on this.

23:15.103 --> 23:18.315
You seem like a good guy,
Cuddy seems decent,

23:18.440 --> 23:20.525
House doesn't.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.445
It means either
you're gonna give in, or Cuddy is.

23:23.737 --> 23:26.198
Either way, I'm sorry.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.876
FOREMAN: Your boyfriend
has me at even odds.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.003
So talk to him.

23:40.128 --> 23:43.006
I did. He said
he's just responding to market forces.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.217
He is.
I got 100 on you.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.889
What do you care
what other people are betting on?

23:51.014 --> 23:52.307
If he's trying to
screw with me

23:52.432 --> 23:54.976
'cause he's jealous Cuddy didn't ask him
to take this job...

23:55.143 --> 23:57.062
Right. You're figuring
he's jealous of your misery.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.021
He's messed up
enough to...

23:58.188 --> 24:00.273
The problem is
you're not miserable.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.234
Then House has been
wasting a lot of time.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.945
You've been humiliated.
Treated like crap.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.988
You have every right
to be miserable, but you're not.

24:07.114 --> 24:11.868
Because even though this job is insane,
and House is insane, you like it.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.370
You always have.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.539
You know what's worse
than a sanctimonious speech?

24:15.664 --> 24:17.707
A sanctimonious speech
that's dead wrong.

24:17.833 --> 24:19.334
See?

24:19.459 --> 24:21.378
You belong with House.

24:25.215 --> 24:27.634
We're gonna use your spinal fluid
to tell us where you lived.

24:27.759 --> 24:28.802
Cool.

24:29.136 --> 24:32.639
Not really. It's a poor substitute
for an actual history and without...

24:32.764 --> 24:34.391
Nah. It's cool.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.395
Yes. It is.

24:39.354 --> 24:42.440
I need you to stay as still as possible.
Ignore the pain.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.025
Bring the pain.

24:45.861 --> 24:48.071
I'm not a masochist.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.406
Neither am I.

24:50.574 --> 24:54.244
I know. But I was responding
to you responding to...

24:54.369 --> 24:55.871
Never mind.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.875
I just like experience.
If it's new, it's interesting.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.334
Yeah? Not me.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.004
I don't just like new,
I gotta have new.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.131
If it's not there,
I make it there.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.966
Really,
I'm just easily bored.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.844
There are 300 million
people in this country.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.929
If I'm doing exactly
what everyone else is doing,

25:13.054 --> 25:14.306
then who
the hell am I?

25:14.431 --> 25:16.308
You know
what I mean?

25:17.350 --> 25:18.602
We're just
about finished.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.312
I like hot tubs.

25:22.063 --> 25:23.440
They're nice.

25:29.905 --> 25:30.739
You don't knock?

25:30.864 --> 25:34.284
Are you putting
K-Y jelly on his phone receiver?

25:34.701 --> 25:36.077
An exploding
snake in his drawer?

25:36.203 --> 25:37.412
No.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.625
I'm replacing
his Vicodin stash with laxatives.

25:41.750 --> 25:44.961
- Don't. Don't stoop to his level.
- Why?

25:45.086 --> 25:48.173
Because he's suddenly
gonna realize he's no longer 14?

25:48.298 --> 25:49.883
Either I take
his garbage forever,

25:50.008 --> 25:51.509
or I give him
a reason to stop.

25:51.635 --> 25:56.223
You don't have to make him miserable.
Just make him think that he's won.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.724
I'm not gonna
fire Foreman.

25:57.849 --> 26:00.018
I said think he's won.

26:00.143 --> 26:03.605
Find some other way to soothe his ego.
The thing's big enough.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.942
You must be able to find
some corner to polish.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.779
Where were you
two hours ago?

26:12.113 --> 26:13.907
Where were you?

26:19.496 --> 26:21.998
- What do you have?
- High titres to histoplasmosis.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.833
Probably lived in
the Ohio River Valley.

26:23.959 --> 26:27.087
Also weakly positive
on Coccidiomycosis.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.381
Weak means older.

26:29.506 --> 26:32.217
Means he moved to Ohio
from the San Joaquin Valley.

26:32.342 --> 26:34.052
Or he happened
to visit California.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.804
He's also positive
for Chagas Disease.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.347
Central America.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.349
FOREMAN:
Or he kissed his maid from El Salvador.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.811
Or he sat next to someone from Belize
on a flight to Weehawken.

26:42.936 --> 26:45.313
- Or he ate lettuce from Honduras.
- Yes.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.983
You're right, buzzkill.
This tells us next to nothing.

26:48.108 --> 26:51.861
But since that's on the something side
of nothing, I thought we'd go with it.

26:51.987 --> 26:52.946
His rash is back.

26:53.071 --> 26:56.074
The hot tub isn't hot enough
to keep his body warm.

26:56.199 --> 26:59.035
So, we take his body out of the picture.
Let's hit him from the inside.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.954
Lipopolysaccharide.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.006
LPS won't just
give him a fever.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.049
He could hit 110.
Fry his brain.

27:13.174 --> 27:16.052
HOUSE: Or make him just toasty enough
to keep his blood flowing free,

27:16.177 --> 27:17.721
like my bowels.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.306
You smell that?

27:19.431 --> 27:21.266
It's not gonna
get sweeter.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.768
You nailed Brennan for seeing
what he wanted to see.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.062
- You're no different.
- But you are.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.605
You used to
like this stuff.

27:27.731 --> 27:30.942
You left here because you didn't like
what you were turning into.

27:31.067 --> 27:31.901
Do you like
who you are, now?

27:32.027 --> 27:33.820
Do you like being
Cuddy's errand boy?

27:33.945 --> 27:35.447
(FLUSHES TOILET)

27:35.572 --> 27:38.158
That was just a courtesy flush.
I'm not actually done.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.247
- You want to induce a fever?
- Well, unless you're willing

27:44.372 --> 27:46.791
to don a white T-shirt
and hop into the hot tub with him,

27:46.916 --> 27:49.169
I need another way
to keep him warm or he dies.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.463
- You could maim him.
- I could cure him.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.589
I'm not letting
you do it.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.632
You gonna fire me?

27:55.675 --> 27:56.885
No.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.515
Wait a second.
What the hell was that?

28:03.516 --> 28:05.643
You were won over
by my soaring rhetoric?

28:05.769 --> 28:08.938
I basically just
threatened to hold my breath.

28:11.566 --> 28:13.860
You never intended
to stop me.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.570
You just pretended
to stop me,

28:15.695 --> 28:17.530
so you could pretend
to fail to stop me,

28:17.655 --> 28:19.991
so you could
stroke my ego.

28:21.326 --> 28:23.828
War doesn't end
until Foreman's gone.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.663
Foreman's not
going anywhere.

28:25.789 --> 28:26.956
And

28:27.082 --> 28:29.250
I know when my Vicodin
isn't Vicodin.

28:29.417 --> 28:33.963
Do you know when your birth control
pills aren't birth control pills?

28:35.548 --> 28:39.552
If we can keep your fever up,
we can get you back on dry land.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.346
You feeling okay?

28:42.347 --> 28:44.099
Surprisingly, yeah.

28:45.433 --> 28:46.476
I feel pretty good.

28:46.601 --> 28:49.396
That's not the way
fevers usually work.

28:50.522 --> 28:54.609
Nothing around here
works the way it's supposed to work.

28:54.734 --> 28:55.902
No kidding.

28:56.027 --> 28:57.404
You're giving me
a fever.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.949
Doctors don't
give people fevers.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.159
It was necessary
to keep your blood flowing.

29:03.284 --> 29:04.577
Yeah.

29:05.829 --> 29:07.747
It was necessary.

29:09.207 --> 29:12.001
And that was
all that mattered.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.506
It's exciting,
isn't it?

29:17.090 --> 29:18.800
You're happy?

I need help in here!

- V-fib. We've got to shock him.
- Get him out of the water.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.067
How long's
he been out?

29:36.192 --> 29:38.236
Just a few seconds.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.864
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

29:44.784 --> 29:46.119
- He's dry enough.
- Not yet.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.203
- Dry faster.
- Ten more seconds.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.621
- He'll get brain damage.
- He needs...

29:48.746 --> 29:50.081
- Kutner, you...
- Wait!

29:50.206 --> 29:52.250
He's dry enough. Clear.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.260
For one of them.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.976
TAUB: Cardiac arrest. We were able to
shock him back to normal sinus rhythm.

30:10.101 --> 30:11.686
And Kutner nearly
into a coma.

30:11.811 --> 30:17.942
So, now, you've electrocuted yourself
and set a patient on fire.

30:18.067 --> 30:19.777
- I like the dedication.
- Thank you.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.404
- It wasn't a compliment.
- Yeah, it was.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.990
The insult comes now.
You're insane!

30:24.908 --> 30:28.411
You either have an aversion to towels,
or you want pain. I think both.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.038
I'm thinking it goes back
to high school gym.

30:30.163 --> 30:31.706
Anybody think we should discuss

30:31.831 --> 30:33.958
which infection is causing
the cold agglutinins

30:34.083 --> 30:36.419
before they stop
his heart again?

30:36.544 --> 30:37.962
Sure. Why not?

30:39.631 --> 30:43.009
Until they find his car
we have to assume he's traveled

30:43.134 --> 30:46.721
to Ohio, California, Central America
and possibly Weehawken.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.431
- Nothing on the blood cultures.
- Do them again.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.308
Quadruple run time.

30:50.975 --> 30:54.270
We know the infection
is in his heart. We do a biopsy.

30:54.395 --> 30:57.023
If we see polys, we've got bacterial.
Lymphs, we've got viral.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.985
He just had a heart attack.
Ripping out a piece might kill him.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.612
Yeah.

31:02.737 --> 31:05.323
We biopsy
his toe instead.

31:05.448 --> 31:08.201
No. That's a terrible idea.

31:08.326 --> 31:12.497
Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his
heart. Come on. I'll join you.

he'd take you, anyway.

and no one's gonna be happy here.

- And Cuddy's gonna end up pregnant.
- What?

- What is you having sex with...
- Starts Monday.

He's from Hamilton, Ohio.

Here's everything
he had in his trunk and his glove box.

32:35.330 --> 32:37.832
No need for
the heart biopsy.

who he is and what he has.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.338
- You saved his life.
- Really?

32:43.463 --> 32:47.216
No, you idiot. It's VapoRub
and lunch receipts.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.677
We have his name. We could find his
doctor, get his medical records...

32:49.802 --> 32:53.348
It's 8:00 at night.
The biopsy will be faster.

32:53.473 --> 32:57.185
Not fast enough to save him,
but that's hardly the point.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.313
Thirteen.

33:02.774 --> 33:04.734
Is your name Thirteen?

33:06.694 --> 33:08.738
Why did you volunteer
to go streetwalking?

33:08.863 --> 33:10.239
I thought I could
help that way.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.700
A black Mormon
could help that way.

33:12.825 --> 33:15.161
There's no reason
for you to want to be there.

33:15.286 --> 33:18.164
Which means there's a reason
you didn't want to be here.

in the mirror?

she's hot?

She is. She's my boss.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.851
The rash is back.

34:22.019 --> 34:23.688
Increase the drip.

34:24.397 --> 34:27.066
If you think that's
the right thing to do.

34:27.775 --> 34:30.319
This is so frustrating.

34:31.696 --> 34:33.781
I don't think
that's me.

34:40.288 --> 34:41.873
Hey.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.291
Get in there.
See how he's doing.

34:43.416 --> 34:45.042
You were
just in there.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.712
Apparently, it's impossible
to see anything else when I'm in there.

34:47.837 --> 34:50.590
I'm a blinding
white hot light of power.

34:52.091 --> 34:55.428
Got it. Pink.
Good size.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.096
Nice specimen.

34:57.221 --> 34:58.431
I'm scared.

34:59.974 --> 35:02.602
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.396
No.

35:07.607 --> 35:08.816
No, it's not.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.404
I'm not interested
in how he's doing.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.114
I'm interested in
how she's doing.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.492
So, get in there and
tell me how he's doing.

35:17.617 --> 35:20.077
You think he'll mimic her
if I'm in there with her?

35:20.203 --> 35:22.830
You're a powerful,
dominating man, but who knows?

35:23.247 --> 35:24.791
- So, I'm gonna get fired before her?
- Yes.

35:24.916 --> 35:28.085
You're gonna get fired right now
unless you get in there...

35:28.211 --> 35:30.046
Nothing on the biopsy.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.631
And how is he?

35:31.756 --> 35:32.882
His fever's at 106...

35:33.007 --> 35:34.091
I know.

35:34.217 --> 35:35.927
But how is he?

35:36.636 --> 35:38.596
Bitter?
Sexually frustrated?

35:38.888 --> 35:40.056
He's delightful.

35:40.264 --> 35:43.476
Loves the smell of freshly baked rhubarb
pie and isn't afraid to love.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.019
Also, his rash
is coming back.

35:45.144 --> 35:48.022
He needs the meds and the tub.
Just to keep him stable.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.273
Fine.
Soak him again.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.025
He'll be happy.
Loves hot tubs.

35:51.150 --> 35:53.027
No. You love hot tubs.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.530
Find the rest of the gang. Tell them
to meet me at the lecture hall.

35:55.655 --> 35:57.240
I hate hot tubs.

35:58.533 --> 36:00.493
What did you say?

36:00.618 --> 36:02.995
- I hate...
- He likes.

36:05.581 --> 36:06.707
Who else
was in there?

36:06.833 --> 36:08.751
No one.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.002
You didn't think
to mention that?

36:10.336 --> 36:14.340
The guy likes warm, swirling water.
Didn't know that was diagnostic.

36:14.465 --> 36:16.217
It's not.

36:16.342 --> 36:20.221
What it is, is that water hit him,
and he had a thought.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.515
Not about you,
but about him.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.853
We need to
splash him some more.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.002
Do I know you?

36:53.838 --> 36:55.840
You look familiar.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.216
You, too.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.094
My name's Robert Elliot.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.639
I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.

37:05.099 --> 37:06.559
Me, too.

37:08.895 --> 37:10.438
What do you do?

37:11.689 --> 37:13.065
Stuff.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.275
Me, too.

37:18.195 --> 37:21.282
What brings you
to New Jersey?

37:21.616 --> 37:23.367
Is it work
or vacation?

37:26.329 --> 37:27.538
(GASPS)

37:29.290 --> 37:30.499
Work.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.253
What type of work?

37:36.172 --> 37:37.632
I'm tired.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.428
(HEART MONITOR BEEPING)

37:57.610 --> 38:01.072
I eat out a lot.
A lot of restaurants.

38:04.992 --> 38:06.577
The Knotty Pine,

38:08.579 --> 38:10.206
Ritchies.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.166
I know those places.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.129
They're good, huh?

38:17.254 --> 38:18.714
They're convenient.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.049
For what?

38:20.174 --> 38:22.134
They're on the road.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.011
You on
the road a lot?

38:24.136 --> 38:26.180
No more than you,
I suppose.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.062
You ever use
this stuff?

38:35.064 --> 38:37.024
I use it all the time.

38:39.944 --> 38:41.362
I use it all the time.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.072
Yeah.
I just said that.

38:45.616 --> 38:49.453
You know, the cool thing about this
stuff is you can do a lot with it.

38:49.578 --> 38:52.081
Soften your skin,
you can treat scrapes,

38:53.666 --> 38:55.292
naughty stuff.

39:07.471 --> 39:08.764
(SNIFFS)

39:11.559 --> 39:13.394
Why did you do that?

39:16.355 --> 39:19.608
Because it doesn't
smell like dung.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.157
You're saying
you like the smell?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.451
Not really.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.663
It just doesn't
smell like dung.

39:34.165 --> 39:36.709
Something else does
smell like dung?

39:36.834 --> 39:38.044
Yeah.

39:38.169 --> 39:39.378
Dung.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.594
You guys ready?

39:47.386 --> 39:52.767
Now is the time that you stare
at me in slack-jawed amazement.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.894
He sells farm equipment.

39:55.978 --> 39:59.774
See? Pig lagoons. Pig farms.

39:59.899 --> 40:04.195
And as every child knows, where you
have pigs, you have pig poo.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.155
But as very
few children know,

40:06.280 --> 40:09.992
where you have pig poo,
you have eperythrozoon infection.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.787
We'll start him
on clarithromycin.

40:12.912 --> 40:15.998
This time tomorrow
he'll be back to his old self.

40:16.123 --> 40:17.625
Whoever that might be.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.293
It can wait.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.003
He has
a temperature of 107.

40:21.212 --> 40:23.172
It can wait 15 minutes.

40:24.173 --> 40:26.258
You know where Cuddy is?

40:29.136 --> 40:32.014
Hi. I'm the Dean of Medicine.

40:32.139 --> 40:35.684
Hi. I'm the guy
who saved your life.

40:35.810 --> 40:37.603
So, what if it's House?

40:37.728 --> 40:39.814
Then I take the job
at Mount Zion.

40:39.939 --> 40:41.607
There is no job
at Mount Zion.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.443
- House said that...
- If House said it, it must be true.

40:44.652 --> 40:48.155
I can fire him. I can fire him now.
I can fire him tomorrow.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.907
- I don't even need a reason.
- She doesn't fire me.

40:50.032 --> 40:51.534
She never will fire me.
Because she needs...

40:51.659 --> 40:52.952
He's a good doctor,
that's all.

40:53.077 --> 40:54.620
I respect his expertise,
and I...

40:54.829 --> 40:56.163
She's hot for me.
Always...

40:56.288 --> 40:58.415
Shut up!

40:59.959 --> 41:02.920
Well, that could have
been either of us.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.256
You have great yabos.

41:09.468 --> 41:12.304
That still could have
been either of us.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.933
You lose.

41:16.058 --> 41:20.646
Seriously. I have always thought my
breasts were one of my best features.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.731
Damn.

41:33.075 --> 41:34.827
You all suck.

41:36.078 --> 41:39.665
The two of you took
14 hours to find a car.

41:40.875 --> 41:45.045
You forgot to mention
that a guy with no memory had memories.

41:46.130 --> 41:49.341
If you keep on thinking
that insane guys have hidden wisdom,

41:49.508 --> 41:52.887
you're gonna wind up
shooting people on a subway.

41:54.638 --> 41:56.015
- Something.
- So,

41:57.099 --> 41:59.435
which one of us
sucks the most?

41:59.560 --> 42:01.604
- It's a tie.
- Between?

42:01.729 --> 42:02.855
All of you.

42:02.980 --> 42:04.273
AMBER: We're all fired?

42:04.398 --> 42:06.358
None of you are fired.

42:06.483 --> 42:08.319
(ALL SIGHING)

42:16.952 --> 42:18.204
That was nice of you.

42:19.288 --> 42:20.372
Sure.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.041
Why didn't
you fire anyone?

42:22.166 --> 42:24.043
- They're good doctors.
- Right.

42:24.168 --> 42:26.420
Why didn't
you let Brennan quit?

42:26.545 --> 42:27.546
He's a good doctor.

42:27.671 --> 42:28.797
Right.

42:28.923 --> 42:30.132
By not letting
anyone go,

42:30.257 --> 42:34.136
you made six people
happy and one person happy and rich.

42:35.012 --> 42:40.226
Chase won every one of those bets. So
either you're just really nice or...

42:40.351 --> 42:42.561
What's your cut?

42:42.686 --> 42:44.647
Fifty percent.

42:44.772 --> 42:46.899
How bad do you
want to keep your job?

42:47.274 --> 42:49.026
I'll keep my mouth shut.

42:51.028 --> 42:52.071
Hey.

42:53.239 --> 42:56.116
You actually do
want to stay, don't you?

42:56.242 --> 42:58.035
I think I do.

42:58.160 --> 43:01.330
Every one of those idiots
got some insight about themselves

43:01.538 --> 43:04.458
from the pig salesman, but not one
of them did anything about it.

43:04.708 --> 43:07.670
People don't learn.
They don't change. But you did.

43:08.337 --> 43:10.506
You're a freak.
