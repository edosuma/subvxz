don't play ball in the house.

Hey!

ALEX P. KEATON:
What about me, Mallory?

00:26.374 --> 00:27.766
What about my feelings?

J.J. EVANS: Hey, I knew
everything would be all right.

[ E! True Hollywood Story

00:33.294 --> 00:37.080
NARRATOR:
During the '70s, millions
huddled in front of their TVs

00:37.124 --> 00:40.083
to watch the frothy antics
of The Glimmer Gang.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.521
Little Dickie Roberts
formed the center of the show,

00:43.565 --> 00:44.609
and his crooked smile

00:44.653 --> 00:46.046
and casually tossed off
catch phrases

00:46.089 --> 00:49.353
became the fad of a nation
longing for escapism.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.008
This is his story.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.881
Peggy Roberts
had only one goal in life--

00:55.925 --> 00:57.361
to be in showbiz.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.449
And when she got pregnant,

00:58.493 --> 00:59.885
she felt like
it only slowed her down.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.845
Peggy never said for sure
who the father was,

01:02.888 --> 01:03.933
but the most persistent rumor

01:03.976 --> 01:05.369
concluded
that it was David Soul,

01:05.413 --> 01:08.764
the talented, hunky actor
from Starsky and Hutch.

01:08.807 --> 01:12.202
Don't give up on us, baby...

01:12.246 --> 01:13.899
And on July 2, 1967,

01:13.943 --> 01:15.423
Dickie Roberts
came into the world.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.426
Peggy began auditioning him
for acting parts almost daily.

01:18.469 --> 01:22.125
Here's Peggy Roberts
in a 1989 interview.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.605
When it came to auditions,

01:23.648 --> 01:26.608
I used to dress him up
for the part, whatever it was.

01:26.651 --> 01:27.957
I mean, if they wanted a cowboy,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.263
they got a cowboy.

01:29.306 --> 01:32.875
Even if they wanted a girl,
I'd give them one.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.573
Do you know that he once
auditioned

01:35.617 --> 01:36.661
for Pippi Longstocking?

01:36.705 --> 01:39.142
And he got the part.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.492
I felt so stupid
walking into an office

01:41.536 --> 01:43.320
holding the kid's hand.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.931
It was rough on me.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.237
NARRATOR:
Then, in 1972, when NBC

01:47.281 --> 01:49.935
created a show called
The Glimmer Gang,

01:49.979 --> 01:51.241
Dickie was cast immediately.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.721
The show became
an instant success

01:52.764 --> 01:56.464
and soon Dickie's picture
was plastered on magazines,

01:56.507 --> 01:57.726
lunch boxes and board games.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.946
And his trademark catchphrase
was everywhere.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.339
This is Nucking Futs!

02:02.383 --> 02:03.906
[canned laughter]

02:03.949 --> 02:06.256
But after six years of success,
the ratings began to slip.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.912
And just as fast as the Dickie
phenomenon exploded,

02:09.955 --> 02:11.000
it was over.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.089
Dickie's mother,
soon after, left him

02:13.133 --> 02:14.743
and moved out of the area.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.266
He found himself alone.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.094
Here's former Eight is Enough
star Dick Van Patten.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.097
Stardom is really hard
on child actors,

02:21.141 --> 02:25.101
and when you throw in a horrible
stage mother like Peggy Roberts,

02:25.145 --> 02:27.451
poor little Dickie
had no chance.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.540
NARRATOR: Nobody would hire
the troubled actor,

02:29.584 --> 02:32.369
and pictures surfaced
of Dickie's odd behavior--

02:32.413 --> 02:34.458
including compulsive
glove wearing.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.505
He had his name legally changed
to "David Soul's Son."

02:37.548 --> 02:40.551
Then, tired of explaining
who David Soul was,

02:40.595 --> 02:42.945
he tried "Hutch's Son."

02:42.988 --> 02:44.207
Later, he changed it again

02:44.251 --> 02:45.208
to the element chart symbols

02:45.252 --> 02:48.994
for fluorine,
titanium and zinc.

02:49.865 --> 02:50.866
Today, Dickie Roberts

02:50.909 --> 02:52.781
is certain
that a showbiz comeback

02:52.824 --> 02:53.869
is in the cards for him.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.480
He is working
as a valet parking cars.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.090
But as everybody knows,

02:58.134 --> 03:02.486
in Hollywood, sometimes your
dreams can come true... again.

We'll get it fixed.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.170
Then we'll be back home

05:45.214 --> 05:46.563
I like your hat.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.477
Shut up.

your ass kicked

you're just a puss.

Look, we're
broke,

05:56.660 --> 05:57.487
okay?

05:57.531 --> 05:58.619
Maybe now might be a good time

05:58.662 --> 06:01.230
to try to sell
that stupid autobiography

you write
all the time.

I-I can't publish

because it ends up with me

I have to wait
to publish it

until I'm back on top,
which I will be soon, I swear.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.328
I'm going to have
a big comeback.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.243
There's something
you got to face, baby.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.854
Okay, there's not going
to be any comeback.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.160

out of here.

cover that?

Good to see you.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.299
Oh, my God.
You're Leif Garrett.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.040
I used to have
such a crush on you.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.173
Can I have
your autograph?

08:00.654 --> 08:01.655
No, I'm fine.

How about if I put it
on a $5 bill?

08:03.700 --> 08:04.788
Make it a $20?

So, Dickie, how you
been, what's up?

08:10.315 --> 08:15.146
Just got back from
a very successful TV stint.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.630
No such thing
as bad press, right?

08:20.674 --> 08:21.544
Unless it's that.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.632
[chuckling]

08:22.676 --> 08:24.242
So, Leif, what have
you been up to?

08:24.286 --> 08:26.897
I got a record out
that I'm happy about.

08:26.941 --> 08:27.724
Rock and roll, man.

08:27.768 --> 08:28.856
Went on an acting
audition

08:28.899 --> 08:30.161
about three
months ago.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.467
Well, that's great man.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.643
I've been going on movie
auditions all the time,

08:33.687 --> 08:36.558
Hey, you going to read for
Mr. Blake's Backyard?

08:36.602 --> 08:38.169
I definitely am.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.344
I was... where...

08:39.388 --> 08:40.650
What-What's that one again?

08:40.693 --> 08:41.520
Rob Reiner's new film?

08:41.563 --> 08:43.610
It's the talk
of the town.

08:43.653 --> 08:44.698
Yes, Rob Reiner.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.177
My God, did his dog
have puppies yet?

08:46.221 --> 08:47.396
Ooh, I should
send him a note.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.354
You know what,
I have to call him anyway.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.095
I left my sweater
in his guest room.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.575
It's called
Mr. Blake's Backyard?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.577
Remember how Frank Sinatra
in his comeback

08:54.621 --> 08:57.014
played Maggio in
From Here to Eternity,

08:57.058 --> 08:58.102
and then won the Oscar?

08:58.146 --> 08:59.669
Or like Travolta
in Pulp Fiction?

08:59.713 --> 09:01.845
It's the role of
a lifetime, man.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.151
Great.
Leif, I got to go.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.369
It was good to see
you, man.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.547
Hey, are we still on
for poker Thursday?

09:07.590 --> 09:10.027
DICKIE:
Cyndi, where are you?

09:10.071 --> 09:11.507
I've left three messages.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.205
Listen, there's this new movie,
it's a Rob Reiner movie.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.250
You got to get me in...

09:15.293 --> 09:16.294

Go to go.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.731
Are you going
to park cars or what?

They're stacking up?

09:18.775 --> 09:19.863
Yes, sir, Mr. Rollins.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.082
Look, Dickie, the only
reason I hired you

09:21.125 --> 09:22.083
is I used to watch
your show,

09:22.126 --> 09:23.519
and your life
is kind of pathetic.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.739
Thanks
for being a fan.

09:31.788 --> 09:36.227
You never get anywhere unless
you bend the rules a little bit.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.968
Woo-hoo.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.449
[phone ringing]

09:40.492 --> 09:42.712
MAN:Uh, this is
the Wernick Agency.

09:42.756 --> 09:46.368
This is his assistant...
Shaquikwa speaking.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.196
Sidney, where the hell
have you been?

09:48.239 --> 09:50.415
I've been calling all morning.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.722
Hey, you know those pigeons
I feed?

09:52.766 --> 09:56.073
They attacked me,
six of the bastards.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.032
I had to go get stitches.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.947
Wait a second, wait a second.

09:59.990 --> 10:00.991
[honking]

10:01.035 --> 10:02.906
Oh, come on,
what is this guy doing?

10:02.950 --> 10:04.168
Hey, move that pile.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.736
The light ain't getting
any greener, jarhead.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.824
Hey, screw you, man.

10:07.868 --> 10:08.999
Why don't you step
out of that little,

10:09.043 --> 10:11.262
bitty wussy car
and talk to my face, huh?

10:11.306 --> 10:12.307
Hey, screw you.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.438
[growls]

10:13.482 --> 10:16.224
I'll kick your
steroid-loving ass, moron.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.268
Jujube.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.096
I'm going to bust you up, man.

10:19.140 --> 10:22.360
Smell you later, stink bomb.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.753
I'll find you.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.233
Three, G, Q...

10:25.276 --> 10:27.539
Hey, Dickie, aren't you worried
about that guy

10:27.583 --> 10:29.716
tracking you down and beating
the crap out of you?

10:29.759 --> 10:33.633
No, I'm in someone else's car,
plus the windows are tinted.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.764
Hey, listen, this movie part

10:34.808 --> 10:36.810
sounds like
the key to everything, man.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.464
You've got to get me in
to see Rob Reiner.

10:39.508 --> 10:42.424
And as your agent,
let me ask you this--

10:42.467 --> 10:43.773
you got any ideas?

10:43.817 --> 10:46.384
'Cause, I mean, that's just
way out of our league.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.473
Now, you want
to get on Elimidate,

10:48.517 --> 10:49.561
that's a different story.

10:49.605 --> 10:52.086
I think if I talk
to some movie stars,

10:52.129 --> 10:53.435
they can help me.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.611
Yeah, you, where are you
going to meet movie stars?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.134
Oh, man,
that's the easy part.

10:57.178 --> 11:01.617
WOMAN: So, I woke up in a boxcar
outside Lincoln, Nebraska.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.446
All right, it was
5:00 in the morning.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.621
Hey, Tom Arnold,
what's up?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.841
Hey, hey, it's Tom "A"
in here, okay?

11:07.884 --> 11:09.581
And keep quiet;
it's just getting good.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.975
She's a cross-addicted
sex addict.

11:12.019 --> 11:12.889
Ooh.

11:12.933 --> 11:13.629
And I realized

11:13.673 --> 11:15.457
that I had
hit bottom.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.371
I hit bottom.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.459
I see you on TV
all the time.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.461
You're doing great.
Listen, what's up?

11:19.504 --> 11:20.723
Hey, Orville
and Wilbur called.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.159
They want to buy
your collars.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.858
They're going to take off
from Kitty Hawk at sundown.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.294
What does that mean?

11:26.337 --> 11:28.165
They invented
the airplane,

11:28.209 --> 11:31.125
and your lapels
are unusually huge.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.343
That's funny.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.170
Yeah.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.084
Or is it?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.303
I can bench-press
350 pounds.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.521
That's great.
That's a lot.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.262
Hey, man, I see
you everywhere.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.176
You're
kicking ass.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.047
True Lieswas great.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.048
I rent it
all the time.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.006
Can you get me in
with Rob Reiner?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.486
Excuse me. Sir?

11:44.529 --> 11:45.617
Can we help you?

11:45.661 --> 11:48.229
Are you here
because you're an alcoholic?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.360
Whoa. No. No. Baby.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.406
Don't get that
floating around town.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.582
Last thing I need
is people to think

11:53.625 --> 11:56.324
I'm some drunk,
alkie loser.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.327
Not that it's bad.
I mean, it's cool.

11:59.370 --> 12:02.025
You need to be
an alcoholic to be here.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.635
All right.

12:03.679 --> 12:09.685
Aw, there's got to be another AA
meeting around here somewhere.

12:09.729 --> 12:15.647
Bingo. I'll take Brendan Fraser
to block.

12:15.691 --> 12:20.217
Whew! Sorry I'm late, gang,
but I am wasted.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.828
Drinking shots

12:21.871 --> 12:22.829
like a madman.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.395
I'm shocked,
cocked and crapulous.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.701
You know
what I mean?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.356
One tequila, two tequila,
three tequila, floor.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.270
Right? Who's with me?

12:29.313 --> 12:30.793
This guy knows
what I'm saying.

12:30.837 --> 12:31.881
[gargling]

12:31.925 --> 12:32.752
Can we help you?

12:32.795 --> 12:34.405
Oh, God, I hope you can.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.233
My name's Dickie Roberts,

12:36.277 --> 12:38.758
and I'm a whiskey-puking alkie.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.803
Well, that's all
very interesting,

12:40.847 --> 12:42.979
but this is a Lamaze class.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.895
Oh. Okay. Nice to see you.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.898
I'm telling this story
to everybody I see.

12:48.942 --> 12:52.423
That's got to be the dumbest
thing I've ever witnessed.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.468
Maybe it was.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.383
But listen,
what are you doing

12:55.426 --> 12:56.688
in Lamaze class anyway?

12:56.732 --> 12:58.081
Is your wife pregnant?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.430
Yeah.
My wife is pregnant.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.302
Here she is now.
Have you met?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.694
Uh... no.
Actually, we have.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.827
Three years ago, you hit on me,
and I shot you down,

13:04.871 --> 13:07.177
and then you stole my number
from a friend.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.613
You know that
we've been married

13:08.657 --> 13:10.137
more than
three years, right?

13:10.180 --> 13:11.660
And then you
drunk-dialed me,

13:11.703 --> 13:15.620
like, 30 times, trying to hook
up some sort of booty call.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.014
Yes, right. What's up?

13:18.058 --> 13:19.624
Anyway,
I got to pee.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.409
Nice to see you.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.194
Yes. Good to see you again.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.630
Anyway, Brendan,

13:25.674 --> 13:26.762
I'm a big fan and...

13:26.806 --> 13:28.633
And you think
that you could score

13:28.677 --> 13:31.723
if I got you an audition
for Mr. Blake's Backyard?

13:31.767 --> 13:33.203
Oh, my God. Of course.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.814
Yeah, I can make a phone call
for you. Is it Rob Reiner?

13:34.857 --> 13:37.468
Oh, my God!
I love Brendan Frazier.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.295
Fraser.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.296
It is Fraser.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.038
It's Fraser.
Why do people say...?

13:49.524 --> 13:51.265
So, my good buddy--

13:51.308 --> 13:52.614
maybe you've
heard of him-

13:52.657 --> 13:55.486
Jorge of the Jungle--
Brendan Fraser.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.661
Oh, you heard me.

13:56.705 --> 13:57.793
I didn't stutter.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.362
Brendan Fraser is
going to make a call--

14:01.405 --> 14:03.755
hook me up
with Rob Reiner.

14:03.799 --> 14:04.931
Did Mr. Fraser call you?

14:04.974 --> 14:07.063
I'll believe it
when I see it.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.152
Okay,
I raise ten bucks.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.327
Actually, one buck

14:10.371 --> 14:12.852
and the original
braces that Marcia wore

14:12.895 --> 14:14.723
in the "Brace
Yourself" episode--

14:14.766 --> 14:17.682
easily worth
nine bucks on eBay.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.380
Gross. I'm in.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.337
All right, I'm in.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.861
All right,
speaking of big stars,

14:21.904 --> 14:25.386
anybody seen who People Magazine
gave Sexiest Man Alive to?

14:25.429 --> 14:27.692
George Clooney. Don't get it.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.694
George Clooney? That
doesn't make sense.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.087
Who is voting
on that stuff?

14:31.131 --> 14:32.610
You know what, though?

14:32.654 --> 14:34.874
George Clooney is a great star.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.311
He's huge, and deservedly so.

14:37.354 --> 14:40.183
[all talking at once]

14:40.227 --> 14:41.358
I loved that boat movie.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.491
You know who I don't
get is Brad Pitt.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.884
Yeah, what's up
with Brad Pitt?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.929
Brad Pitt changes
his hair every day.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.627
Are girls really into guys
with great hair,

14:49.671 --> 14:52.195
pretty faces
and built like a truck?

14:52.239 --> 14:55.503
Yeah.Actually, yeah.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.765
You know, one time,

14:56.808 --> 14:58.723
someone thought I was
Brad Pitt from the side.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.986
Yeah, and 20 people

15:00.029 --> 15:02.597
thought you were a girl,
but not from the side.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.773
Watch it.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.383
I raise two bucks

15:06.427 --> 15:07.732
with this

15:07.776 --> 15:10.083
authentic replica
of the jinxed

15:10.126 --> 15:12.999
Tiki idol
from the Bradyepisode

15:13.042 --> 15:13.913
"Hawaii Bound."

15:13.956 --> 15:16.219
Easily worth
two bucks on eBay.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.699
I am out.

15:17.742 --> 15:18.918
Yeah, I'm out.

15:18.961 --> 15:19.570
I'm out.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.963
There's your two.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.271
And you know who I don't get?
Vin Diesel.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.533
Oh, yes!

15:25.576 --> 15:26.708
Who's Vin Diesel?

15:26.751 --> 15:27.839
Is he good-looking?

15:27.883 --> 15:29.232
I mean,
I don't know

15:29.276 --> 15:30.625
what's going
on with him.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.540
Is he Chinese?
I don't know.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.324
That's so
horrible, man.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.238
You're such a dick.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.197
Besides,
he'd kick your ass.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.154
Come on, Dickie.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.069
How jealous can
you get, really?

15:40.113 --> 15:41.070
It's getting bad.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.376
Vin Diesel's actually
a cool guy.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.595
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.206
He actually lent me money once.

15:46.249 --> 15:49.774
I just want to be a star again
so goddamn bad.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.602
What's the thing
you miss the most, Dickie?

15:51.646 --> 15:53.474
You know what?
It's not the limos.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.345
Oh, I miss the limos.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.346
It's not the girls,

15:56.390 --> 15:58.261
the money,
the parties...

15:58.305 --> 16:00.133
Girls.Girls.
Girls.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.177
The money.
Money.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.136
Wait. Seriously,
you guys had limos?

16:03.179 --> 16:05.138
You know what?
It's not that stuff I miss.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.705
It's something else.
It... it's something

16:07.749 --> 16:10.056
I miss so bad it hurts.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.145
I just miss the love, you know?

16:12.188 --> 16:15.800
I miss... My mom loved me when I
was a star,

16:15.844 --> 16:19.282
and people loved me
when I was a star.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.632
And when somebody
loves you,

16:21.676 --> 16:23.460
it gives you center.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.635
It makes you

16:24.679 --> 16:25.767
feel good inside.

16:25.810 --> 16:29.727
That's what being a star
did for me.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.294
But you know what?

16:31.338 --> 16:32.817
It's all going to happen.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.036
I got my fingers crossed.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.474
I got my hopes up
for this Rob Reiner thing.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.128
Anyway... back to work.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.390
Two pair, Williams.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.652
Read it and weep.

16:41.696 --> 16:42.479
Uh-uh-uh!

16:42.523 --> 16:44.220
What are you, nucking futs?

16:44.264 --> 16:45.352
[laughing]

16:45.395 --> 16:47.006
Four of a kind.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.007
You lose.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.052
Oh, man.

16:50.096 --> 16:53.795
they don't give out giant Rob
Reiner parts to guys like us.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.884
I'll bet you
a thousand dollars--

16:55.927 --> 16:57.494
I'll make it a hundred dollars--

16:57.538 --> 17:00.497
and the actual football we used
to hit Marcia in the face with

17:00.541 --> 17:02.412
in that "Oh, My Nose, My Nose"

17:02.456 --> 17:03.500
episode,

17:03.544 --> 17:05.372
Brendan Fraser
never calls.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.548
[phone rings]

17:07.590 --> 17:09.332
Hold, please.

17:09.376 --> 17:14.076
Go for Dickie.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.035
Brendan.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.819
Of course I can meet Rob Reiner
tomorrow at noon.

17:18.863 --> 17:21.344
You're the coolest.
You came through.

17:21.387 --> 17:22.519
Thank you.

17:22.563 --> 17:26.001
Oh, my God!
He did it!

17:27.742 --> 17:29.613
Sidney, this is the big one.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.485
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.095
Thanks for letting me
use your car.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.358
You go, son. Go.
You hang on to that energy.

17:35.402 --> 17:38.361
Oh, I will. I'm going
to nail this bastard.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.754
All right, now, remember:

17:39.797 --> 17:41.451
You believe, you'll receive.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.105
You doubt, you'll go without.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.978
Oh, here's my song. I got to go.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.807
In the night

17:49.851 --> 17:51.070
My body's weak

17:51.113 --> 17:54.682
I'm on the run,
no time to sleep

17:54.725 --> 17:57.293
I'm going to ride

17:57.337 --> 17:59.208
Ride like the wind

17:59.252 --> 18:00.775
To be a star again

18:00.818 --> 18:03.038
Changing the words,
not the vibe.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.086
Whoo-hoo! This part is mine!

18:11.307 --> 18:13.440
Boom.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.182
Hold the door!

18:16.225 --> 18:17.226
Okay.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.314
Hold it.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.968
I've got it.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.448
Ooh!

18:21.491 --> 18:23.363
Oh.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.410
Hello?

18:27.454 --> 18:28.803
Of course.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.239
Listen, sorry about that.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.328
It's just that I couldn't
be late to see Rob.

18:32.372 --> 18:35.244
Yikes! I mean, not yikes.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.724
I mean, what bump?

18:36.767 --> 18:37.986
Hey, are these

18:38.029 --> 18:40.119
Mr. Blake's Backyard?
Can I have one?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.859
Everybody in town
is dying to read it,

18:41.903 --> 18:45.515
but this script is on
a complete and total lockdown.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.865
However...

18:47.909 --> 18:48.997
I'll sneak you a copy

18:49.040 --> 18:51.608
'cause I recognize
you from that TV show.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.088
Sure.
Ooh, you will?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.221
Although you'll have to wait

18:55.264 --> 18:58.398
until hell freezes over,
asshole!

18:58.441 --> 19:00.530
[phone rings]

19:00.574 --> 19:02.271
Yes?

19:02.315 --> 19:05.622
Yeah.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.798
Mr. Reiner will see you now.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.149
Okay.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.759
Dickie

19:11.802 --> 19:12.542
Roberts!

19:12.586 --> 19:14.631
This is nucking futs!

19:14.675 --> 19:15.458
Say it.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.286
This is nucking futs!

19:17.330 --> 19:17.982
Hilarious.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.375
Now say it in Spanish.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.768
Aw, I'm kidding ya.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.422
So Nicholson says
to Tom Cruise--

19:22.465 --> 19:25.773
you know, in that...
that Jack voice of his--

19:25.816 --> 19:29.646
"That Demi Moore
is a really good actress.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.344
"We should
re-title the movie

19:31.387 --> 19:37.480
A Few Good Men and One Damn,
Hot Chick with Huge Boobs."

19:37.524 --> 19:39.830
[laughing]

19:39.874 --> 19:41.049
Didn't I see you

19:41.092 --> 19:44.226
parking cars
at Morton's Restaurant?

19:44.270 --> 19:47.621
Me?

19:47.664 --> 19:49.057
Yes, you did.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.973
I'm researching
a role for a movie,

19:52.016 --> 19:57.021
and that movie
is called Valet Parkers.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.545
But you know what?

19:58.588 --> 20:02.026
If I got your movie, I'd turn
that thing down. Who cares?

20:02.070 --> 20:03.419
So this part...

20:03.463 --> 20:09.730
I mean, you are exactly
the height that I imagined.

20:09.773 --> 20:15.039
You have the right build,
the right hair,

20:15.083 --> 20:16.954
the right basic look.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.304
Know this:

20:18.347 --> 20:19.566
I will do any form

20:19.609 --> 20:21.742
of drastic
cosmetic surgery

20:21.785 --> 20:23.831
to change
my appearance

20:23.874 --> 20:25.485
to help the look.

20:25.528 --> 20:26.834
But-- and this

20:26.877 --> 20:28.183
is a very big but--

20:28.227 --> 20:30.620
this is a huge acting part.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.143
I mean,
the entire movie

20:32.187 --> 20:33.623
hinges on
this performance.

20:33.667 --> 20:37.758
And, Dickie, I just don't think
you could handle it.

20:37.801 --> 20:40.326
I mean,
because, well...

20:40.369 --> 20:44.286
because you're
not a real person.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.288
Not real?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.811
I don't mean to insult you.

20:47.855 --> 20:50.031
It's just that, you know,
when an actor researches a part,

20:50.074 --> 20:51.728
it takes weeks,
sometimes months,

20:51.772 --> 20:53.077
to get inside of a character.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.427
For you
to research this part,

20:54.470 --> 20:57.299
you'd have to find out
what it's like to be normal.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.909
Because basically,
that's this guy.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.911
He's just a simple, normal guy.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.261
I could do that. That's easy.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.175
But you don't even know
what normal is.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.394
You completely missed out

21:05.438 --> 21:08.223
on the basic foundation
of adulthood--

21:08.267 --> 21:10.225
which is a childhood.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.009
Who cares about all that stuff?

21:12.053 --> 21:13.054
Look, I'm good.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.621
Throw me
a little somethin'-somethin'

21:14.664 --> 21:18.015
from this supposed childhood
I missed, I'll act it out, man.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.408
Check it out.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.236
A-All right. Uh...

21:21.280 --> 21:24.065
Let's say you're...
you're six.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.459
Uh, let me see
the look on your face

21:26.502 --> 21:29.984
on Christmas morning
when you creep down the stairs

21:30.027 --> 21:32.378
and you see that red bike
under the tree.

21:32.421 --> 21:35.642
You probably never
even had that experience.

21:35.685 --> 21:39.080
Gotcha, six, bike, tree, stairs.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.039
[whispers]:
Fake stairs.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.957
Holy shit! A bike!

21:47.001 --> 21:48.524
You're six.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.352
Holy crap! A bike!

21:50.396 --> 21:51.135
You're six.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.442
Ga-ga, goo-goo bikey.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.530
Too far back.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.140
Dickie, you're a mess.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.969
I mean, I-I don't know
what you'd have to do

21:59.013 --> 22:03.452
You'd probably have to relive
your entire childhood.

22:03.496 --> 22:04.453
Wait.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.281
I'm not actually
casting this part

22:06.325 --> 22:07.500
for another couple
of months,

22:07.543 --> 22:09.328
but barring some kind
of a miracle,
Yeah.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.808
I just don't think
this is right for you.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.375
But you just said...

22:13.419 --> 22:14.681
Said what?

22:14.724 --> 22:16.117
If I relive my childhood.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.205
I can do that.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.163
Dickie,
you're going to hire a family?

22:19.207 --> 22:21.688
That's why I'm selling
my book-- I need money.

22:21.731 --> 22:22.732
We're happy about that.

22:22.776 --> 22:23.690
This is amazing stuff.

22:23.733 --> 22:24.821
What a life you've led.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.127
The only thing I ask

22:26.170 --> 22:28.390
is that you minimize the
sexy, sensational stuff

22:28.434 --> 22:29.826
because it might
hurt my career

22:29.870 --> 22:31.132
with people
like Rob Reiner.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.178
Here on, uh, page 47,
it says you had a whistle

22:34.222 --> 22:35.266
stuck up your ass.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.659
Yeah, stuff like that.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.095
I think we should
[clicks tongue]cut it.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.270
Yeah, but it's
a whole chapter.

22:39.314 --> 22:40.402
It's fantastic.
And, also,

22:40.446 --> 22:41.838
I had a light bulb
up there, too.

22:41.882 --> 22:42.839
[clicks tongue]

22:42.883 --> 22:44.275
A light bulb?
Well, partially.

22:44.319 --> 22:47.235
It was sticking out a little bit
and when I bent over,

22:47.278 --> 22:49.280
it looked like my ass
had a good idea.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.413
Dickie, this whole thing
just sounds bizarre.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.762
No, you know what,
I need this.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.199
You know I want a big comeback
and this is the one.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.854
Please help me on
this, Sidney. Come on.

22:57.898 --> 22:58.812
Of course,

22:58.855 --> 22:59.856
our standard advance

22:59.900 --> 23:03.077
for something like this
is $30,000.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.209
Did you say $30,000?

23:05.253 --> 23:07.037
Holy God Almighty!

23:07.081 --> 23:08.517
Christ on a crutch!

23:08.561 --> 23:09.388
We'll take it!

23:09.431 --> 23:13.087
[Spanish rap song plays]

23:22.226 --> 23:24.011
[answering machine]:
You have 67 messages.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.404
First message:
[beeps]

23:25.447 --> 23:29.495
MAN: I saw your ad
about hiring a family.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.413
[barks viciously]

23:34.935 --> 23:35.892
[whimpers]

23:35.936 --> 23:38.025
You that actor guy
needs a family?

23:38.068 --> 23:39.200
Uh, yeah, but, you know what,

23:39.243 --> 23:41.724
this whole thing's
not going to work,

23:41.768 --> 23:42.812
but thank you.

23:42.856 --> 23:43.770
Get back here!

23:43.813 --> 23:45.032
Dance with the devil!

23:45.075 --> 23:46.120
Leave me alone!

23:46.163 --> 23:48.818
You got the cizash,
we got the family.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.777
Sad Eye Sadie...

23:51.821 --> 23:54.128
...Mad Dog, is it, Giant?

23:54.171 --> 23:57.523
Uh, I'm going to
think about it.

23:57.566 --> 23:58.567
Great.

23:58.611 --> 23:59.568
Hey, yo, Dickie.

23:59.612 --> 24:00.961
You nucking futs? Yo.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.223
Call a bitch.

24:02.266 --> 24:06.619
I don't actually have
a family, per se.

24:07.663 --> 24:08.925
Is it hot in here?

24:08.969 --> 24:13.495
I'm just going
to take off my robe.

24:13.539 --> 24:14.670
Oh!

24:14.714 --> 24:15.932
Oh, God.

24:15.976 --> 24:19.327
This one's been teasing me.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.797
Come on, Popeye.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.799
Hello.

24:56.843 --> 24:57.974
Hi.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.889
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah. I got a message

24:59.933 --> 25:01.064
that you had a family

25:01.108 --> 25:02.457
that was willing to put me up
for a month?

25:02.501 --> 25:06.156
Uh, sorry,
there must be some mistake.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.157
No, uh, 741
Mockingbird.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.725
Is this the
Finney residence?

25:09.769 --> 25:12.075
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.251
[horn honking]

25:17.385 --> 25:19.605
Hey, George.
Hey, Andy.

25:19.648 --> 25:20.693
Dickie Roberts.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.825
"This is nucking futs!"

25:22.869 --> 25:24.000
It is.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.262
George Finney-- big fan.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.830
I just loved
your show.

25:27.874 --> 25:28.962
Oh, my goodness.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.878
I thought
you looked familiar.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.444
But, George, did you...?

25:33.488 --> 25:35.011
Oh, Grace, I
should explain.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.013
Dickie and I talked
on the phone

25:37.057 --> 25:38.362
about a mutually
advantageous

25:38.406 --> 25:40.016
business venture.
Why don't we, uh,

25:40.060 --> 25:41.844
go inside;
I'll explain everything.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.543
All right, that
sounds great.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.025
Hey.
This is the casa.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.679
Whoo!
Kids?

25:50.723 --> 25:51.680
Kids?

25:51.724 --> 25:52.855
Hey, kids, come here
for a second.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.335
I want you to
meet somebody.

25:54.378 --> 25:55.989
George, can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:56.032 --> 25:57.164
Just a second,
Grace.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.208
Dickie, this is

25:58.252 --> 25:59.688
Sam and Sally.

25:59.732 --> 26:00.602
Sam's the boy,

26:00.646 --> 26:03.126
so, that must
make her Sally.

26:03.170 --> 26:05.694
[chuckling]

26:05.738 --> 26:07.609
Okay, why don't you guys
make small talk,

26:07.653 --> 26:10.394
and Grace and I
will pop into the other room

26:10.438 --> 26:13.136
and hammer out some details.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.096
[exaggeratedly friendly]:
Hi.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.620
How are you?

26:18.664 --> 26:21.101
We're fine.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.538
How are you?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.931
You don't think
you should have

26:24.974 --> 26:25.975
run all this
by me first?!

26:26.019 --> 26:27.324
George, you invited
a stranger

26:27.368 --> 26:28.238
to live in our home.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.892
It's only
for a month or so.

26:29.936 --> 26:30.980
Well...Look,

26:31.024 --> 26:32.460
you just finished
night school, right?

26:32.503 --> 26:34.723
Started your
interior design thing.

26:34.767 --> 26:35.855
That costs money.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.160
Money we don't have.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.075
That is one of the reasons
I took those classes--

26:39.119 --> 26:40.903
so I can contribute an income.

26:40.947 --> 26:41.991
When?

26:42.035 --> 26:43.210
George...

26:43.253 --> 26:45.560
All I'm saying
is we could really use

26:45.604 --> 26:46.735
this extra money right now.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.346
Pay for some TV ads
down at the car lot.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.697
Take some of the pressure
off of me.

26:51.740 --> 26:55.831
I'm asking you this
as a favor.

26:55.875 --> 26:56.919
Help me out with this.

26:56.963 --> 27:00.967
I think it'll be
a good thing.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.971
I'm going
to need a bed.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.015
Should it be
a crib?

27:06.059 --> 27:07.930
[false chuckle]

27:07.974 --> 27:08.975
Here's a $20.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.063
I like the idea.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.281
Let's just bring it back
a touch, okay?

27:11.325 --> 27:13.109
Seriously,
how about a water bed?

27:13.153 --> 27:14.197
A water bed?

27:14.241 --> 27:16.112
Yeah, I got
a little lower back noise.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.418
My neck's crunching up.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.463
I think I'll move in tomorrow,
bright and early.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.682
Sounds great, huh?

27:20.726 --> 27:23.119
Operation Re-do Childhood
is about to begin.

27:23.163 --> 27:24.773
I don't want him
in our room.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.645
Kids, we really
want this thing

27:26.688 --> 27:27.994
with Mr. Roberts
to work out,

27:28.037 --> 27:30.823
so, let's try and be
as accommodating as possible.

27:30.866 --> 27:31.606
Okay?

27:31.650 --> 27:32.738
[sighing all around]

27:32.781 --> 27:35.131
I like that;
I like where you're headed.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.525
That's the right attitude.

27:37.568 --> 27:41.790
Dickie, I'm telling you,
I've called Reiner's office

27:41.834 --> 27:42.617
over and over.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.662
They won't
put me through.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.272
I must have left
five to six

27:45.315 --> 27:46.447
to seven
or eight messages.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.927
Well, then, leave
nine, ten or eleven.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.798
Come on, by the end
of all this, Sidney,

27:49.842 --> 27:51.408
you've got to get
me that audition.

27:51.452 --> 27:54.107
Dickie, I bet you wish
you had a better agent.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.325
No, you're my agent, man.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.370
Come on, we're a team.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.719
Hey, by the way,
I read that script,

27:57.763 --> 28:00.374
Mr. Blake's Backyard
last night.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.897
I couldn't make heads
or tails of it.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.291
It's got so much adult stuff,
blah, blah, blah--

28:04.334 --> 28:05.422
I didn't know
what was going on.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.163
Maybe I do need
to learn something.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.208
Well, Hutch
is your dad.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.470
You've got more talent
in your veins

28:09.513 --> 28:11.515
than half the actors
in this town.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.821
You'll be great.

28:12.865 --> 28:17.043
Sidney, David Soul
is not my father.

28:17.086 --> 28:20.002
Oh, kid, I'm sorry.

28:20.046 --> 28:21.525
Is it Starsky?

28:21.569 --> 28:24.746
No. It's neither.

28:25.660 --> 28:29.490
I don't really remember
my real dad.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.752
The only memory I have

28:30.796 --> 28:34.147
is playing
that board game Candyland.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.497
I was about five
or six.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.846
We were laughing.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.195
I was really happy.

28:39.239 --> 28:40.370
But then he left,

28:40.414 --> 28:43.373
and it was just me and my mom
for a while,

28:43.417 --> 28:45.811
and then she left,
so...

28:45.854 --> 28:47.247
I'm sorry, kid.

28:47.290 --> 28:51.381
Sidney, the point is,
you've always been there for me.

28:51.425 --> 28:52.687
You've been a good guy.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.864
You're a good agent;
I appreciate it.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.999
All right, listen,
you go do your project,

29:00.042 --> 29:03.045
and I promise you,
I'll do whatever it takes

29:03.089 --> 29:04.220
to get you that audition

29:04.264 --> 29:05.265
with Rob Reiner, okay?

29:05.308 --> 29:07.876
I never doubted you
for a second.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.486
We're a team.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.228
We're going
to get this.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.796
Go get 'em!

29:29.680 --> 29:32.205
[clearing throat]

29:32.248 --> 29:33.772
And another thing,
Stranger Danger,

29:33.815 --> 29:35.730
all these video games--
they're mine.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.167
And, uh, Sally's stuff--
that's hers.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.168
So, no touchy.

29:39.212 --> 29:40.256
Hey, can you knock it off

29:40.300 --> 29:42.084
with the Stranger Danger
moniker?

29:42.128 --> 29:43.085
I'm not nuts about it.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.870
Well, I think this
water bed thing

29:44.913 --> 29:45.871
is a little silly.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.307
Are you, like,
cuckoo in the head?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.396
Yeah, and I don't think
you should turn on that hose.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.441
You'll get
a Water Wiggle action going.

29:51.485 --> 29:52.791
Ooh, Water Wiggle-- what's that?

29:52.834 --> 29:54.140
The toy--
Water Wiggle?

29:54.183 --> 29:56.838
You don't know
what toy that is?

29:56.882 --> 29:57.665
Uh-uh.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.058
Oh, man, this is sad.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.974
You really did miss out,
didn't you, Stranger Danger?

30:02.017 --> 30:03.018
Well,
I can teach you

30:03.062 --> 30:04.977
how to put Preparation H
on your eyes

30:05.020 --> 30:05.847
to get rid of bags, huh?

30:05.891 --> 30:07.631
I'll help you,
you help me.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.850
I'm just saying

30:08.894 --> 30:10.286
a Water Wiggle
will beat the crap out of you.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.072
Yeah, it's less of a toy
and more of a bruise machine.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.509
I like that, that's interesting,
tell me more.

30:15.552 --> 30:16.727
What other toys should I know?

30:16.771 --> 30:18.425
Uh, Gobots, Hot
Wheels, Robodon.

30:18.468 --> 30:19.426
SALLY:
Transformers.

30:19.469 --> 30:20.470
SAM:
Slip and Slide.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.515
SALLY:
Stratego.

30:21.558 --> 30:22.516
SAM:
Mousetrap.

30:22.559 --> 30:23.517
SALLY:
Trolls.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.518
SAM:
Hurry Up.

30:24.561 --> 30:25.562
SALLY:
He-man.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.650
SAM:
Slinky.

30:26.694 --> 30:27.564
SALLY:
Pac-man.

30:27.608 --> 30:28.609
SAM:
Clue.

30:28.652 --> 30:29.566
SALLY:
Wheel-o.

30:29.610 --> 30:30.567
SAM:
Donkey Kong.

30:30.611 --> 30:31.438
SALLY:
Caterpillar.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.395
SAM:
Duncan Yo-Yo.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.309
SALLY:
Razor Scooters.

30:33.353 --> 30:34.658
SAM: Return to
Wolfenstein.

30:34.702 --> 30:35.703
Uh-uh-uh. Okay, that's enough.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.444
Don't make me call
the Guinness Book.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.881
But what about
the best game of all?

30:39.925 --> 30:42.275
Come on, guys.

30:42.318 --> 30:43.189
Candyland?

30:43.232 --> 30:44.625
No.
Don't know it.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.453
[laughing]:
No? I got you.

30:46.496 --> 30:47.889
Whoo! In your face. Candyland.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.412
That was the most fun
I had as a kid.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.806
I remember I picked the card
with the ice-cream bar on it.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.200
I was like...
[singing goofy fanfare]

30:54.243 --> 30:55.679
We have a winner! Whoo!

30:55.723 --> 30:56.506
Yeah, whatever.

30:56.550 --> 30:57.507
But still, it's Water Wiggle

30:57.551 --> 30:59.248
that you should
be thinking about.

30:59.292 --> 31:02.556
Steady, Chicken Little.

31:07.039 --> 31:09.215
Oh.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.657
Oh, my God.

31:22.619 --> 31:26.797
What's up? You like that?!

31:26.841 --> 31:32.586
Yeah! What happened, bitch? Huh?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.894
Damn, that
Water Wiggle thing

31:35.937 --> 31:37.808
is like a Stephen King movie.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.549
It's supposed to be a toy?

31:39.593 --> 31:41.247
Anyway, okay,
so, this

31:41.290 --> 31:42.248
is a Water Wiggle.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.033
Any other toys
you want to show me?

31:51.344 --> 31:53.215
Oh, my gosh.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.000
Look at all this shizzit.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.653
What's shizzit?

31:56.697 --> 31:57.828
It's a secret way to swear.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.265
Again, learn from me,
I'll learn from you.

31:59.308 --> 32:04.400
SAM:
These were all our toys from
when we were kids.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.401
Yeah.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.359
Seems like

32:06.402 --> 32:07.490
only yesterday.

32:07.534 --> 32:12.408
Wow, we sure did have
a lot of shizzit.

32:12.452 --> 32:13.627
Farm-a-long.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.150
MACHINE VOICE:
The rooster crows

32:15.194 --> 32:17.413
[crowing]
his morning crow.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.762
And the horse whinnies

32:18.806 --> 32:19.981
for its rider.
Boring.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.331
Let me guess--
the cow says "moo"

32:22.375 --> 32:23.767
and the duck
says "quack."

32:23.811 --> 32:25.726
You need to update
this thing.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.510
How about
"The sprinkler says..."

32:27.554 --> 32:29.817
[percussive hissing noise]

32:29.860 --> 32:31.732
Yeah. And a motorcycle
goes...

32:31.775 --> 32:36.084
[goofy revving noises]

32:36.128 --> 32:41.437
And the jet ski-- similar
to the motorcycle, not the same.

32:41.481 --> 32:45.354
[more goofy revving]

32:48.009 --> 32:49.097
See, it bogs out a little bit

32:49.141 --> 32:52.622
'cause you have water
in the carb. Hmm?

32:52.666 --> 32:54.885
Sally's looking at me like,
"You're an idiot."

32:54.929 --> 32:58.759
Well, get in line, sister,
because my ex-girlfriend says,

32:58.802 --> 33:00.108
"You're a loser,"

33:00.152 --> 33:01.718
and the casting director says,
"You're washed up,"

33:01.762 --> 33:03.677
and my mom says,
"You're an embarrassment,"

33:03.720 --> 33:05.200
and the guy in the street says,
"You suck,"

33:05.244 --> 33:08.638
and I said, "No, you suck,"
and he said,"You suck, dude,"

33:08.682 --> 33:09.857
and I go, "No, you suck,"

33:09.900 --> 33:11.641
and he goes,
"You know you suck," and I go...

33:11.685 --> 33:14.993
[incoherent ranting,
crowing, whinnying]

33:15.036 --> 33:16.733
The rooster crows.
[mooing]

33:16.777 --> 33:18.431
The rooster crows.
[mooing]

33:18.474 --> 33:20.650
[sighing]:
What else you got?

33:20.694 --> 33:24.306
SAM: Could you pass
the potatoes, please?

33:24.350 --> 33:27.092
Popeye, no.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.832
Go.

33:28.876 --> 33:32.314
Oh, hey, Mom, where's
my field hockey jersey?

33:32.358 --> 33:36.840
Hmm. I washed it and folded it
and put it in your drawer.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.712
No wonder you couldn't find it.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.496
Hey, Stranger Danger,
I got to ask,

33:40.540 --> 33:41.541
what's with the gloves?

33:41.584 --> 33:42.933
It's kind of freaking me out.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.805
Uh, sanitary reasons. Shh.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.329
Anyway, you guys,
I don't want to stop you.

33:47.373 --> 33:48.504
Keep going.

33:48.548 --> 33:49.462
Talk, talk, talk.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.159
I love all this normal crap.

33:51.203 --> 33:51.855
"Crap?"

33:51.899 --> 33:54.336
Stuff. Normal stuff.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.598
Hey, where's George?

33:55.642 --> 33:57.296
[chuckling]:
I want a little Dad action.

33:57.339 --> 34:00.038
He's hardly ever at dinner.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.256
Sally,

34:01.300 --> 34:02.170
Jane called.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.345
She wants you to call her back.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.521
Who's this Jason boy
she's got a crush on?

34:05.565 --> 34:07.523
Oh, just some boy,
but Heather Bolin

34:07.567 --> 34:10.351
is totally stealing him
away from her.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.179
Why?

34:12.224 --> 34:13.964
She's the most beautiful girl
in the school,

34:14.007 --> 34:15.096
and whatever she wants,
she gets.

34:15.139 --> 34:17.880
SAM: Heather Bolin
has an older brother.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.056
He's a real jerk.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.884
He totally
picks on Sam.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.190
It seems like everybody
at school does.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.585
[phone ringing]:
There's my phone.

34:25.628 --> 34:26.803
Shh. Two seconds.

34:26.847 --> 34:27.717
Go for Dickie.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.676
SIDNEY: Hey, Dickie.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.766
I just got back
from Rob Reiner's office.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.463
Guess who was there?

34:34.507 --> 34:35.464
Sean Penn.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.248
No, not Sean Penn!

34:37.292 --> 34:39.815
Not Sean Penn! Damn!

34:39.860 --> 34:41.253
Oh, Dickie,
don't worry about it.

34:41.295 --> 34:44.038
I struck up a friendship
with Rob's security people.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.387
I really feel
we're moving forward.

34:45.431 --> 34:48.434
Yes! And this studying-up-
on-being-a-kid thing

34:48.476 --> 34:49.522
is going great.

34:49.565 --> 34:50.784
Get me in there,

34:50.827 --> 34:52.525
I'll nail that part
like Jesus the Carpenter.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.614
[chortling]:
All right,

34:54.657 --> 34:56.485
I'll see you later, buddy.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.834
Heh-heh! Whoo!

34:57.878 --> 34:59.445
Oh, sorry.

34:59.488 --> 35:00.707
I got a little excited.

35:00.750 --> 35:04.493
Let me go drain the main vein,
how about that?

35:04.537 --> 35:09.107
I mean, I go pee pee now.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.292
It's so crazy.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.467
The Water Wiggle thing
was a joke.

35:21.510 --> 35:23.251
He destroyed this toy
that pissed him off.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.601
It's like he was
totally out of control.

35:25.645 --> 35:26.950
Mom, you've got
to listen to me.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.735
We don't want him
around anymore.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.432
Can't you make
him go away?

35:30.476 --> 35:31.564
GRACE:
I'd like to,

35:31.607 --> 35:34.088
but your father made
this deal with him.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.786
Let's pretend that staying
in our tree house out back

35:36.830 --> 35:38.266
is good for
his project.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.835
Yeah. But, Sam, the tree house
is pretty old and crappy.

35:41.878 --> 35:45.143
We want him out of our house,
don't we?

35:45.186 --> 35:47.188
Don't we?

35:48.494 --> 35:49.147
Hey.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.060
You know what, Dickie?

35:50.104 --> 35:51.410
We came up with
a great idea.

35:51.453 --> 35:54.108
Maybe you should stay
out back in the tree house.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.196
Sam, that's
a great idea.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.807
A real kid would do that,
wouldn't he?

35:57.851 --> 35:59.505
Yeah. Yeah, that might be fun.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.811
All right.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.424
[crickets chirping]

36:05.467 --> 36:08.818
[distant dog barking]

36:18.567 --> 36:20.439
[groans]

36:20.482 --> 36:22.310
[disco music playing]

36:22.354 --> 36:23.964
I wonder what
he's doing up there.

36:24.007 --> 36:27.576
Who cares? Just so Stranger
Danger's out of our house.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.839
But still.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.493
Yeah.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.452
It actually looks pretty cool.

36:33.495 --> 36:36.672
Is that a disco ball?

36:36.716 --> 36:38.021
See, maybe we
should

36:38.065 --> 36:39.762
peek our heads in.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.677
Aw, freak out!
[bell rings]

36:41.721 --> 36:44.332
Okay, let me do the talking.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.204
Freak out!

36:47.683 --> 36:49.076
Aw, freak out!

36:49.119 --> 36:50.295
Uh, may I help you?

36:50.338 --> 36:54.560
Was I being too loud
in my tree house?

36:54.603 --> 36:55.430
Um...

36:55.474 --> 36:57.040
Well, we just
wanted to know

36:57.084 --> 36:58.346
if we could come up.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.129
"Can we
come up?"

36:59.173 --> 37:00.305
All right, you can come up

37:00.348 --> 37:02.481
for a little bit,
see what you're missing.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.223
And have a real good time

37:06.136 --> 37:09.096
Burn, baby, burn,
disco inferno...

37:09.139 --> 37:12.055
Well, you really fixed
this place up, didn't you?

37:12.099 --> 37:13.056
Oh, yeah, I did.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.884
Put a little lipstick
on this pig.

37:14.928 --> 37:17.278
But I'm confused,
'cause you like it now,

37:17.322 --> 37:20.281
and I thought the tree
house was a drag.

37:20.325 --> 37:24.938
If I took a poll,
people would say it sucked.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.069
But maybe I'm wrong.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.550
Maybe I'm stupid,
maybe I'm a dumb-dumb.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.770
It is kind
of cool now.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.902
Oh, it's cool now.

37:32.946 --> 37:33.729
You hear that?

37:33.773 --> 37:35.427
It's kind of cool now.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.385
Let's go.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.299
Wait.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.475
Don't leave.
You guys can stay.

37:40.519 --> 37:43.043
What do you want to do?

37:43.609 --> 37:46.133
[thunder crashing]

37:46.176 --> 37:47.221
And so the hook hand

37:47.265 --> 37:49.876
was hanging there
on the car door.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.965
[thunder cracks]

37:52.008 --> 37:54.924
Ooh, that was intense.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.883
Okay, now it's my turn.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.754
All right.

37:58.798 --> 37:59.929
[making spooky noise]

37:59.973 --> 38:02.715
This is the story
of the witch

38:02.758 --> 38:05.108
of Cloverfield
Central School.

38:05.152 --> 38:07.110
[thunder cracks]

38:07.154 --> 38:08.286
Once upon a time,

38:08.329 --> 38:11.941
there was this witch in school.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.422
She was a very,

38:14.466 --> 38:17.295
very bad witch.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.166
Ha, ha.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.602
All the boys
liked her,

38:20.646 --> 38:25.303
because they didn't know
what a bad witch she was.

38:25.346 --> 38:26.173
Sally,

38:26.216 --> 38:28.001
does this witch have a name?

38:28.044 --> 38:30.786
Mm...
No, not really.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.614
Just a witch.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.050
Right,
and Sally,

38:34.094 --> 38:36.314
what does this witch look like?

38:36.357 --> 38:38.185
Okay, she dresses very nice,

38:38.228 --> 38:41.057
'cause her dad
has a lot of money.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.929
Really hot
capris,

38:42.972 --> 38:45.061
super tight Zootopia tops.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.889
I don't think this is a witch.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.675
I think it's Heather Bolin.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.807
What? That's crazy.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.983
Okay, it's Heather Bolin.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.333
[chuckling]

38:55.376 --> 38:56.551
Oh, you know what, Sally?

38:56.595 --> 38:59.119
I don't like her
and I've never even met her.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.991
Anyone who bugs you
can't be good.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.428
Now it's my turn.

39:03.471 --> 39:09.129
My story is called "The Day
the Sitcom Got Canceled."

39:09.172 --> 39:11.174
[thunder booms]

39:11.218 --> 39:16.354
The sky, she was stormy
that night.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.834
Suddenly, the phone rang.

39:18.878 --> 39:23.448
[makes ringing noise]

39:25.667 --> 39:28.235
[makes ringing noise]

39:28.278 --> 39:30.890
The little boy's mother
picks up.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.021
"Hello?"

39:32.065 --> 39:35.198
The evil producer on
the other end said,

39:35.242 --> 39:38.941
"The ratings have hit
a six-year low."

39:38.985 --> 39:40.639
[gasping]

39:40.682 --> 39:41.509
It gets scarier.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.685
"The network is in a panic."

39:43.729 --> 39:44.730
[screaming]

39:44.773 --> 39:46.862
Yeah.
Here's where it heats up.

39:46.906 --> 39:50.039
They didn't
have a replacement show.

39:50.083 --> 39:50.823
No, no!

39:50.866 --> 39:51.824
Dickie! [screams]

39:51.867 --> 39:54.696
I know,
what are they going to do?

39:54.740 --> 39:56.306
[shouting]

39:56.350 --> 39:58.308
What? What's wrong?

39:58.352 --> 39:59.092
There's something...

39:59.135 --> 40:01.094
Okay, I'll stop. What?

40:01.137 --> 40:03.618
[screaming]

40:03.662 --> 40:04.532
[screams]

40:04.576 --> 40:06.491
[screaming and shouting]

40:06.534 --> 40:11.104
[items crashing and breaking]

40:11.844 --> 40:15.717
[muttering softly]

40:15.761 --> 40:17.240
No.

40:17.284 --> 40:19.895
DICKIE:
Don't, don't.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.201
Get away.

40:21.244 --> 40:23.029
No, get off.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.596
[muttering]

40:24.639 --> 40:27.642
He's been talking in his sleep
like that for the last hour.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.427
[Dickie moans]

40:29.470 --> 40:30.210
Dickie?

40:30.253 --> 40:31.820
He's getting... Get off.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.649
Don't leave me.
Dickie, wake up.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.912
No. It's on me.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.087
I can't...

40:38.131 --> 40:39.741
Mom?
[Dickie mutters]

40:39.785 --> 40:41.221
What?

40:41.264 --> 40:42.352
Do something.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.485
DICKIE:
No, not again.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.182
[sighs]

40:46.226 --> 40:47.923
[mutters]

40:47.967 --> 40:50.491
Dickie, wake up.

40:50.535 --> 40:51.361
Dickie, wake up.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.015
[gasping]
Wake up.

40:53.059 --> 40:55.148
You were having a bad dream.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.932
Oh, there were these big spiders

40:56.976 --> 40:59.282
and they...
they were trying to eat me

40:59.326 --> 41:02.111
and they jammed their legs
down my ear

41:02.155 --> 41:04.592
and in my brain,
and they were...

41:04.636 --> 41:05.375
Mom.

41:05.419 --> 41:06.942
...guts of my head and...

41:06.986 --> 41:07.943
Come on, Mom, sing it.

41:07.987 --> 41:09.554
And there was so many...

41:09.597 --> 41:10.511
Okay. Dickie,

41:10.555 --> 41:11.991
this is what I
do for my kids

41:12.034 --> 41:13.427
when they're
having a nightmare.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.562
Hush little baby,
don't say a word

41:17.605 --> 41:21.304
Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird

41:21.348 --> 41:24.482
And if that mockingbird
don't sing

41:24.525 --> 41:28.529
Mama's going to buy you
a diamond ring

41:28.573 --> 41:35.580
[quietly]:
If that diamond ring
turns brass...

41:41.586 --> 41:42.195
Okay.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.065
[kisses]

41:43.109 --> 41:46.199
Let's go to bed.
It's okay.

41:59.212 --> 42:01.954
Now, that was probably
the nicest thing

42:01.997 --> 42:04.478
anyone's ever done for me.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.132
You feel bad,
and your mom

42:06.175 --> 42:13.182
actually tries
to make you feel not bad.

42:13.705 --> 42:16.621
Wow.

42:16.664 --> 42:19.841
By the way,
your mom's really hot.

42:19.885 --> 42:21.016
What?
Eww!

42:21.060 --> 42:23.279
What, am I wrong?

42:23.323 --> 42:24.454
And what's the backyard like?

42:24.498 --> 42:25.717
Has she got
the G-string going

42:25.760 --> 42:28.981
or them big ol' grannies
with the louvers?

42:29.024 --> 42:30.635
I'm betting sweet thong.

42:30.678 --> 42:32.201
Ugh!
Gross!

42:32.245 --> 42:34.943
Come on, Sam,
pretend she's not your mom.

42:34.987 --> 42:36.031
Are they real?

42:36.075 --> 42:37.206
I think they're real.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.512
I bumped into them the other day

42:38.556 --> 42:41.210
and it was like "boing,"
and I was like "boing."

42:41.254 --> 42:42.560
Dickie, she's our mom.

42:42.603 --> 42:46.912
She's my mom, too,
and I'm dealing with it somehow.

42:46.955 --> 42:48.783
Anyway.

42:48.827 --> 42:50.219
Good night, prude people.

42:50.263 --> 42:53.309
Dream the dream
of prudes.

42:53.353 --> 42:54.615
Prude it up.

42:54.659 --> 42:58.227
Have a nice G-rated dream
full of prudiness.

42:58.271 --> 43:01.317
Go to sleep, Dickie.

43:02.754 --> 43:07.019
Okay, Stranger Danger,
this is a Slip 'N Slide.

43:07.062 --> 43:08.368
If you master this,

43:08.411 --> 43:10.370
it's the first step
to being a real kid.

43:10.413 --> 43:12.546
Great.
Dickie,

43:12.590 --> 43:13.591
there has to be water on it.

43:13.634 --> 43:15.288
[screeching]
[groans]

43:15.331 --> 43:16.245
Oh, that's...

43:16.289 --> 43:18.030
that's going to leave a mark.

43:18.073 --> 43:20.423
[pants, coughs]

43:20.467 --> 43:23.731
That... stings.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.648
Good to go.

43:27.692 --> 43:29.650
[puffing]

43:29.694 --> 43:31.304
[whoops]

43:31.347 --> 43:33.828
Yeah, all right.
He did it.

43:33.872 --> 43:34.568
That was great.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.962
I got something better.

43:37.005 --> 43:38.050
Just water is lame.

43:38.093 --> 43:40.269
This thing needs
a little Wesson-ality.

43:40.313 --> 43:42.271
Dickie, are you
sure about this?

43:42.315 --> 43:44.622
Steady.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.276
[laughs, whoops]

43:47.320 --> 43:48.364
Here we go.

43:48.408 --> 43:49.975
[puffing]

43:50.018 --> 43:51.803
[yells]

43:51.846 --> 43:52.760
[cheers]

43:52.804 --> 43:53.892
[groans]

43:53.935 --> 43:55.633
Oh, shizzit!

43:56.721 --> 43:58.287
[groans]

43:58.331 --> 44:00.899
Ow...!

44:00.942 --> 44:01.682
[grunts]

44:01.726 --> 44:04.554
[sighs]:
Splinter.

44:04.598 --> 44:07.470
That toy is
Insane in the membrane

44:07.514 --> 44:08.950
Insane, got no brain.

44:08.994 --> 44:10.604
[spits]

44:10.648 --> 44:12.780
I got pretty banged up out
there, but I learned some stuff.

44:12.824 --> 44:15.130
Let's keep it mellow
in the future.

44:15.174 --> 44:17.480
So, what do you drink,
being a kid?

44:17.524 --> 44:19.569
Uh, soda,
like-like root beer.

44:19.613 --> 44:20.875
Well, not a wussy kid.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.268
A real kid, all right?

44:22.311 --> 44:23.704
You had me at the beer part,
but you lost me at root.

44:23.748 --> 44:25.532
Now, let's not jump
to malt liquor,

44:25.575 --> 44:27.055
but something in the middle.

44:27.099 --> 44:28.491
How about real beer?

44:28.535 --> 44:30.885
Whoa, lady. Easy.

44:30.929 --> 44:31.669
Whoa.

44:31.712 --> 44:32.974
Okay, real beer. How many?

44:33.018 --> 44:33.888
Six-pack?

44:33.932 --> 44:35.150
So, you're crazy?

44:35.194 --> 44:36.021
A six-pack?

44:36.064 --> 44:37.675
Are you a total alkie?

44:37.718 --> 44:38.327
Oh, my gosh.

44:38.371 --> 44:39.111
How about four?

44:39.154 --> 44:40.373
One for you, one for you,

44:40.416 --> 44:42.941
and two for me
'cause I'm kind of a husky kid.

44:42.984 --> 44:44.507
Okay, so a six-pack.

44:44.551 --> 44:45.857
You just said four.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.076
Oh, the wussy's taking
the minutes of the meeting.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.164
Okay, four it is.

44:49.208 --> 44:51.819
I'll buy. I'll fly.

44:51.863 --> 44:54.343
We have beer.

44:54.387 --> 44:57.346
We're not supposed
to drink that.

44:57.390 --> 44:59.479
We're supposed to think
about drinking beer

44:59.522 --> 45:00.785
one day, in the future.

45:00.828 --> 45:03.439
It's like, uh, you know,
"When I get older,

45:03.483 --> 45:05.964
I'm going to be allowed
to drink beer."

45:06.007 --> 45:06.965
It's going too fast.

45:07.008 --> 45:08.618
I knew kids
that were on TV shows

45:08.662 --> 45:11.012
getting whiffed up
when they're 16.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.100
"Whiffed up"?

45:12.144 --> 45:14.363
Whiff, coke, toot,
lines, blast, rails,

45:14.407 --> 45:15.713
nose candy, devil's dandruff,

45:15.756 --> 45:18.454
power flower,
sniffy jiffy,

45:18.498 --> 45:20.848
Come on, Sam, the rest
of the class is on page 52.

45:20.892 --> 45:24.243
Dickie, when you're talking
to me, all I'm thinking is

45:24.286 --> 45:25.374
Brick wall, waterfall

45:25.418 --> 45:27.420
Dickie thinks he got it all,
but he don't

45:27.463 --> 45:30.162
And I do, so boom
with that attitude

45:30.205 --> 45:31.380
Peace, punch, Cap'n Crunch

45:31.424 --> 45:32.773
I got something you can't touch

45:32.817 --> 45:34.253
Bang, bang, choo-choo train

45:34.296 --> 45:35.645
Wind me up, I do my thing

45:35.689 --> 45:37.212
No Reese's Pieces, 7 UP

45:37.256 --> 45:39.388
Mess with me, I'll mess you up.

45:39.432 --> 45:41.347
Interesting.

45:41.390 --> 45:42.870
Whatever.

45:42.914 --> 45:44.002
Anyway.

45:44.045 --> 45:46.744
By the way, sniffy jiffy,
it's no good.

45:46.787 --> 45:47.570
Don't do it.

45:47.614 --> 45:48.441
Let me tell
you something.

45:48.484 --> 45:49.659
About this putting stuff off?

45:49.703 --> 45:52.401
When I was your age,
I did whatever I wanted,

45:52.445 --> 45:53.838
whenever I wanted.

45:53.881 --> 45:57.102
Okay, see, that might be
why you're such a mess now.

45:57.145 --> 46:00.105
Oh! How dare you.

46:00.148 --> 46:02.107
Anyway, check this out.

46:02.150 --> 46:03.151
Look, I went ahead

46:03.195 --> 46:05.588
and got you your
precious root beer.

46:05.632 --> 46:09.679
[falsetto]:
Ooh, I love it.

46:11.594 --> 46:12.900
[belches]

46:12.944 --> 46:14.162
[belches]

46:14.206 --> 46:17.470
[both laughing]

46:17.513 --> 46:20.516
[belching]:
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.257
[coughs]

46:22.301 --> 46:24.825
[Sally laughing]

46:24.869 --> 46:29.003
[belching]:
"I am Iron Man."

46:29.047 --> 46:30.526
[laughing]

46:30.570 --> 46:33.573
[belching]:
Iwant to bang your mother.

46:33.616 --> 46:35.227
[Dickie laughing]

46:35.270 --> 46:38.491
[laughs]:
I said I want...

46:41.276 --> 46:42.321
Oh...

46:42.364 --> 46:45.454
DICKIE:
By the way, thanks, you guys.

46:45.498 --> 46:47.892
For what?

46:47.935 --> 46:48.980
Being nice to me.

46:49.023 --> 46:51.939
Knocking off
the Stranger Danger thing.

46:51.983 --> 46:52.940
SALLY:
Well, Dickie,

46:52.984 --> 46:54.550
you're actually
a pretty cool guy.

46:54.594 --> 46:57.989
I mean,
very deep down inside you.

46:58.032 --> 46:59.599
I mean,really deep.

46:59.642 --> 47:02.515
So deep that some people
stop looking.

47:02.558 --> 47:03.733
Deeper than a well.

47:03.777 --> 47:04.865
Deeper than the ocean.

47:04.909 --> 47:07.085
Deeper than the Marianas Trench.

47:07.128 --> 47:08.477
Deeper than a volcano.

47:08.521 --> 47:09.565
Deeper than a...

47:09.609 --> 47:12.917
All right, I got it--
it's deep.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.136
Now, shh.

47:15.180 --> 47:17.312
Sleepy time.

47:17.356 --> 47:21.926
Little prude sleep.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.842
Insane in the membrane

47:24.885 --> 47:29.194
Insane, got no brain.
[mouthing words]

47:38.856 --> 47:41.162
What time did you get in
last night?

47:41.206 --> 47:43.469
Would you get off my back?

47:43.512 --> 47:46.341
I was out with a
salesman all night.

47:46.385 --> 47:47.865
They like to drink.

47:47.908 --> 47:48.822
[laughs]

47:48.866 --> 47:50.345
[singsongy]:
Morning.

47:50.389 --> 47:51.607
Mommy, Daddy, bro, sis.

47:51.651 --> 47:52.608
GRACE:
Good morning.

47:52.652 --> 47:53.566
GEORGE:
Morning, Dickie.

47:53.609 --> 47:55.307
Hey, Pebbles,
where's Bamm Bamm?

47:55.350 --> 47:57.048
Oh! Interesting.

47:57.091 --> 48:00.355
Got a little champagne
brunch for my new family.

48:00.399 --> 48:03.489
How about that?
Mimosa for me posse?

48:03.532 --> 48:05.012
Champagne for my real friends,

48:05.056 --> 48:06.753
and I'm a real pain
to my sham friends.

48:06.796 --> 48:09.277
GEORGE:
Dickie, I'd like you
to stop by

48:09.321 --> 48:10.191
the dealership today.

48:10.235 --> 48:11.236
Oh, a little
father-son thing?

48:11.279 --> 48:12.933
What do I say
to that, Sam?

48:12.977 --> 48:13.934
Give it a yea?

48:13.978 --> 48:15.109
I wouldn't know.

48:15.153 --> 48:16.154
He never asked me
to go to work with him.

48:16.197 --> 48:18.591
All right, mark you
down as no help.

48:18.634 --> 48:20.158
Sally, over to you? Yay?

48:20.201 --> 48:23.988
Yeah, a "yay" will cover it.

48:24.031 --> 48:27.121
So we'll head
up there around,
what, 12:00-ish?

48:27.165 --> 48:28.253
All right. Heh-heh.

48:28.296 --> 48:29.558
Hey, and you-- push
me in the stroller.

48:29.602 --> 48:31.909
I want to get a feel
for that thing.

48:31.952 --> 48:33.388
What?

48:33.432 --> 48:34.433
Ah-dah-dah.

48:34.476 --> 48:35.390
Daddy!

48:35.434 --> 48:36.478
Mommy's balking.

48:36.522 --> 48:37.915
She doesn't
understand--

48:37.958 --> 48:40.743
I'm up against the likes
of Mr. Sean Penn here.

48:40.787 --> 48:42.920
Grace, let's try
and make this work.

48:42.963 --> 48:44.791
Yes, let's try
to make it work.

48:44.834 --> 48:46.619
Thanks, Daddy.
Whoo!

48:46.662 --> 48:49.056
[pops]
Whoo, whoopie!

48:49.709 --> 48:51.580
This feels a little odd.

48:51.624 --> 48:53.713
Dude, I'm the one
in the stroller.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.889
Did you just call me "dude"?

48:55.933 --> 48:57.064
I mean,

48:57.108 --> 48:59.719
It's hard to get my head
around that word.

48:59.762 --> 49:00.850
You know, my actual mother

49:00.894 --> 49:02.983
wanted me to call her
by her first name.

49:03.027 --> 49:05.377
And you're, like,
way too beautiful

49:05.420 --> 49:06.552
to be a mom.

49:06.595 --> 49:08.206
I mean, you obviously are
a mother, so...

49:08.249 --> 49:12.079
I'm wrong, but maybe you're not
as beautiful as I think you are.

49:12.123 --> 49:13.298
Wow, let me sift

49:13.341 --> 49:15.387
through that to find
a nugget of compliment.

49:15.430 --> 49:16.605
Sift away, sifty.

49:16.649 --> 49:18.433
You realize, don't you,
that this whole idea

49:18.477 --> 49:19.652
is without a doubt

49:19.695 --> 49:22.481
the most ridiculous endeavor
ever attempted.

49:22.524 --> 49:23.699
Oh, Grace?

49:23.743 --> 49:24.787
Hi-hi, Mrs. Gertrude.

49:24.831 --> 49:26.876
You know, your tree
is dropping leaves

49:26.920 --> 49:28.182
on our property again.

49:28.226 --> 49:29.401
Oh, I'm really sorry.

49:29.444 --> 49:30.358
It's just that I...

49:30.402 --> 49:31.446
It's getting to
be a nuisance,

49:31.490 --> 49:33.100
and we're trying
to be good neighbors,

49:33.144 --> 49:35.102
but you're really
making it hard.

49:35.146 --> 49:35.885
[moans]

49:35.929 --> 49:37.931
Oh, who do we have here?

49:37.975 --> 49:40.368
Aren't you a little
big for a stroller?

49:40.412 --> 49:41.500
[chuckles]

49:41.543 --> 49:42.631
Aren't you a little big
for a sidewalk?

49:42.675 --> 49:44.111
[horn honks]
I mean,

49:44.155 --> 49:46.635
good God,
hide the wicker furniture.

49:46.679 --> 49:48.550
Whoo! This ass means business.

49:48.594 --> 49:49.899
Folks, this is not a drill.

49:49.943 --> 49:51.771
China, I'm sorry
about the tremors,

49:51.814 --> 49:53.468
but this lady needs
her mail.

49:53.512 --> 49:54.556
What, cat got your tongue,

49:54.600 --> 49:55.644
or do you eat that
for breakfast, too?

49:55.688 --> 49:57.124
[snorting gulps]

49:57.168 --> 50:02.303
And you keep your filthy dog
Popeye out of our yard, too,

50:02.347 --> 50:04.001
you horrid neighbor!

50:04.044 --> 50:06.264
Ca-coon, ca-coon,
ca-coon.

50:06.307 --> 50:07.265
[imitates explosion]

50:07.308 --> 50:08.657
Dickie, you were
very rude to her.

50:08.701 --> 50:10.703
Well, and she was
straight-up with you?

50:10.746 --> 50:11.878
Come on, Grace,

50:11.921 --> 50:13.662
you got to learn to
stand up for yourself.

50:13.706 --> 50:15.012
But to be honest,

50:15.055 --> 50:17.318
I kind of liked standing
up for you just then.

50:17.362 --> 50:18.319
Well, it...

50:18.363 --> 50:21.714
I will say,
in a way it was nice.

50:21.757 --> 50:22.889
I'm not used to it.

50:22.932 --> 50:26.675
Hey! You're that guy
from the TV show.

50:26.719 --> 50:28.764
The washed-up actor freak.

50:28.808 --> 50:30.070
Can I get
a picture?

50:30.114 --> 50:31.071
You know what?

50:31.115 --> 50:33.160
You put it that way,
you sure can.

50:33.204 --> 50:34.248
Look at this.

50:34.292 --> 50:35.206
Smile.

50:35.249 --> 50:36.424
[gasps]

50:36.468 --> 50:37.382
Zoom. Nice.

50:37.425 --> 50:39.297
Ah. There you go, Cap'n.

50:39.340 --> 50:41.299
Memories are forever.

50:41.342 --> 50:43.518
Hey, make doubles.

50:43.562 --> 50:45.042
No, look, I'm sorry,
all right?

50:45.085 --> 50:47.305
Look, I'm new at this, too.

50:47.348 --> 50:48.262
I need your help.

50:48.306 --> 50:49.611
Well, I'll tell you
this much--

50:49.655 --> 50:50.873
you're going to have
to disguise yourself somehow.

50:50.917 --> 50:53.180
Wait, wait, wait,
what do you mean?

50:53.224 --> 50:54.312
Like, dye your hair.

50:54.355 --> 50:55.574
Anything, so people
don't recognize you

50:55.617 --> 50:57.793
and make you forget
you're trying to be a kid.

50:57.837 --> 50:59.056
That's a great idea.

50:59.099 --> 51:01.362
Oh, not only is she sexy,
she's a smart mommy!

51:01.406 --> 51:06.106
Why did that compliment
almost make me puke?

51:06.150 --> 51:08.326
What'd I say?

51:08.369 --> 51:09.892
I was nice.

51:09.936 --> 51:13.244
GEORGE:So, this Indian's sitting
by the side of the road.

51:13.287 --> 51:14.462
He's selling clay pots.

51:14.506 --> 51:16.725
Now a tourist is
looking him over.

51:16.769 --> 51:17.900
He says, "Hey,

51:17.944 --> 51:19.337
"you're selling this pot
for five dollars.

51:19.380 --> 51:22.688
You get the same exact pot
over there for ten dollars."

51:22.731 --> 51:24.037
And the Indian says,

51:24.081 --> 51:27.214
"Some people like to spend
five dollars;

51:27.258 --> 51:30.348
other people like to spend
ten dollars."

51:30.391 --> 51:31.566
[laughs]

51:31.610 --> 51:33.264
Ah, I got a better joke.

51:33.307 --> 51:35.483
Two gay monkeys
go to Istanbul...

51:35.527 --> 51:36.528
Dickie, it's
not a joke,

51:36.571 --> 51:39.052
it's a philosophy of life:
money.

51:39.096 --> 51:39.879
Oh...

51:39.922 --> 51:41.141
Making money--
isn't money

51:41.185 --> 51:43.317
what your little comeback thing
is all about?

51:43.361 --> 51:44.362
Actually, no, it's...

51:44.405 --> 51:45.972
I'll be honest
with you, Dickie.

51:46.015 --> 51:48.844
I've been married for 14 years
to the same woman,

51:48.888 --> 51:49.976
and we got a couple of kids.

51:50.019 --> 51:51.369
They seem like nice kids.

51:51.412 --> 51:53.153
I don't know, I don't spend
a lot of time with them.

51:53.197 --> 51:56.548
I'm not really much
of a kid person.

51:56.591 --> 51:59.899
Man, I'm on a treadmill,
Dickie.

51:59.942 --> 52:03.120
I see everybody else
is having all the fun.

52:03.163 --> 52:06.819
Just when I think
I can't take it anymore,

52:06.862 --> 52:08.168
you fall into my lap.

52:08.212 --> 52:10.214
You're my answer,
Dickie.

52:10.257 --> 52:15.132
You're the thing
that's gonna make me happy.

52:15.175 --> 52:18.874
I'm not into dudes, if that's
what you're ramping up to.

52:18.918 --> 52:22.182
Like, I don't.
I did. I don't anymore.

52:22.226 --> 52:26.665
you get what you want
out of my family...

52:26.708 --> 52:28.971
I get something out of you.

52:29.015 --> 52:30.451
MAN:
Star maps here.

52:30.495 --> 52:32.758
Maps to the
stars' homes.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.803
God bless you, sir.

52:34.847 --> 52:37.937
Thanks.

52:37.980 --> 52:40.592
Hey, Rob Reiner's
not on this map.

52:40.635 --> 52:44.030
God bless you, sir.

52:47.164 --> 52:47.816
Ah...

52:47.860 --> 52:50.863
[sighs]

52:59.306 --> 53:00.525
[barks]

53:00.568 --> 53:02.527
Mm, hey.

53:02.570 --> 53:03.919
[whining]

53:03.963 --> 53:05.051
Oh, what time is it?

53:05.094 --> 53:08.881
3:20. Oh, I gotta go
meet the kids.

53:10.230 --> 53:12.580
Look at little Sammy,
the sissy.

53:12.624 --> 53:13.494
Come on, you guys,

53:13.538 --> 53:15.279
just leave him alone.

53:15.322 --> 53:18.673
His little sister
has to stand up for him.

53:18.717 --> 53:20.197
What a little wussy Sam is.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.111
SAM: Why can't you
just leave me alone?

53:22.155 --> 53:23.025
What'd I ever do to you?

53:23.069 --> 53:24.592
[taunting laughter]

53:24.636 --> 53:27.943
BOY [singsongy]:
Sammy, the sissy,
acting all prissy.

53:27.987 --> 53:30.250
BOYS:
Sammy the sissy, acting

53:30.294 --> 53:31.251
all prissy.

53:31.295 --> 53:32.644
Sammy the sissy,
acting all prissy.

53:32.687 --> 53:34.036
Guys, he's minding
his own business.
Sammy, the...

53:34.080 --> 53:35.690
Why don't you?
Sam, Sally,

53:35.734 --> 53:36.996
what's up?

53:37.039 --> 53:38.302
Dickie, is that you?

53:38.345 --> 53:40.608
BOY [laughing]:
Holy crap on toast!

53:40.652 --> 53:42.306
Look at this freak!

53:42.349 --> 53:45.091
with Sam Finney,huh, Sammy?
[laughing]

53:45.134 --> 53:46.179
Let's get out of here.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.485
Leave him alone,
you creeps!

53:47.528 --> 53:49.182
What did you call us,
you little bitch?

53:49.226 --> 53:50.227
DICKIE:
Whoa, whoa,

53:50.270 --> 53:51.663
whoa, you just said
the wrong thing

53:51.706 --> 53:52.707
to the wrong little girl, Cap'n.

53:52.751 --> 53:54.535
What does
she weigh, 20?

53:54.579 --> 53:55.884
What do you weigh, 2,000?

53:55.928 --> 53:57.495
You want to pick on her?
Why not pick on me?

53:57.538 --> 54:00.062
You bastards want to go
toe-to-toe with me?

54:00.106 --> 54:02.978
I'll go Water Wiggle
on your ass.

54:03.022 --> 54:04.241
[falsetto]:
"Huh? Wha?

54:04.284 --> 54:05.851
I don't understand words.
I'm a dum-dum."

54:05.894 --> 54:08.070
[normal voice]:
Is that red hair,
or did someone

54:08.114 --> 54:09.115
light a fart off your mouth?

54:09.158 --> 54:10.899
[laughter]
Hey!
DICKIE:
Hey?

54:10.943 --> 54:11.857
Don't you mean oink?

54:11.900 --> 54:12.727
Little Piggy,
shouldn't you

54:12.771 --> 54:13.728
run off to the market?

54:13.772 --> 54:14.860
[all laughing]

54:14.903 --> 54:15.904
BOY:
Oink, oink.

54:15.948 --> 54:16.731
That was crazy.

54:16.775 --> 54:17.645
Now the crowd's

54:17.689 --> 54:19.256
turning on you, and that sucks.

54:19.299 --> 54:21.083
Tell you what.
Listen.

54:21.127 --> 54:23.216
Red, tube of goo,
freak of nature,

54:23.260 --> 54:25.436
why don't you
guys run home,

54:25.479 --> 54:26.437
pee your pants,

54:26.480 --> 54:27.568
cry your eyes out,

54:27.612 --> 54:29.396
spank each other's
chubby, little butts,

54:29.440 --> 54:30.528
get up, have an Eggo,

54:30.571 --> 54:32.878
run back here, and
we'll do it all again?

54:32.921 --> 54:34.053
'Cause I like working out

54:34.096 --> 54:35.794
you puke-stain,
little punching bags.

54:35.837 --> 54:37.012
A-choo!

54:37.056 --> 54:38.579
Now beat it.

54:38.623 --> 54:39.580
Yeah!
Yeah!

54:39.624 --> 54:41.103
Get out of my way!
Sam Finney's

54:41.147 --> 54:43.541
way cooler than any of you
will ever be.

54:43.584 --> 54:44.281
What a joke.

54:44.324 --> 54:46.413
Oh, yeah!

54:46.457 --> 54:49.764
Mom, you should have seen
Dickie back there.

54:49.808 --> 54:50.678
It was awesome!

54:50.722 --> 54:51.853
He totally nailed
these kids.

54:51.897 --> 54:53.594
It was a verbal beating,
a carpet bombing.

54:53.638 --> 54:54.769
Actually,
Dickie,

54:54.813 --> 54:56.597
I can't believe what
you did to your hair.

54:56.641 --> 54:57.555
What? Oh...

54:57.598 --> 54:58.643
[laughs]

54:58.686 --> 55:00.297
No wonder
everyone was staring at me.

55:00.340 --> 55:02.821
Dickie, it was great
how you tore into those guys.

55:02.864 --> 55:05.214
I'm not impressed
that Dickie insulted

55:05.258 --> 55:06.215
a bunch of your friends.

55:06.259 --> 55:07.347
Well, they're
not really friends.

55:07.391 --> 55:08.914
Yeah, you should have seen
these guys.

55:08.957 --> 55:10.829
I mean, I hope
they never come back.

55:10.872 --> 55:11.786
They're losers.

55:11.830 --> 55:12.961
Just-just, Mom, relax.

55:13.005 --> 55:14.833
[self-satisfied
chuckling]

55:14.876 --> 55:15.703
Relax?

55:15.747 --> 55:16.965
Wrong attitude
with a mom.

55:17.009 --> 55:17.966
You got to
keep it light,

55:18.010 --> 55:19.794
and, you know,deferential.
Oh!

55:19.838 --> 55:20.969
Look, you guys,
before pizza,

55:21.013 --> 55:22.667
I've got to swing by
this interview.

55:22.710 --> 55:23.972
It'll just take
a few minutes.

55:24.016 --> 55:25.322
They just want to meet
the voice from the phone.

55:25.365 --> 55:27.759
DICKIE:You got an interview?
For what?

55:27.802 --> 55:28.673
An interior design job.

55:28.716 --> 55:30.239
They looked at
my drawings,

55:30.283 --> 55:31.023
and they liked them.

55:31.066 --> 55:32.416
KIDS:
Mom, that's great!

55:32.459 --> 55:33.199
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

55:33.242 --> 55:35.027
That is some cool shizzit.

55:35.070 --> 55:36.811
What did you just say?

55:36.855 --> 55:37.812
Shizzit.

55:37.856 --> 55:38.813
It's a Dickie word.

55:38.857 --> 55:40.424
Dickie, after
my interview,

55:40.467 --> 55:43.122
you and I are going to have
a serious talk.

55:43.165 --> 55:45.820
Mom, I...
Dickie will be fine.

55:45.864 --> 55:47.996
Yeah, he may have
a few rough edges,

55:48.040 --> 55:49.389
but we'll file 'em down for him.

55:49.433 --> 55:53.001
Ah, see, Mommy?
It's all gonna work out.

55:53.045 --> 55:54.220
I don't know this
part of town at all.

55:54.263 --> 55:56.396
My first interview,
and I'm going to blow it

55:56.440 --> 55:57.745
because I can't find the house.

55:57.789 --> 55:59.356
MAN: Turn it, turn it!
[fire truck beeping]

55:59.399 --> 56:01.053
GRACE:
Oh, no, do you believe this?

56:01.096 --> 56:02.402
God, I'm really
going to be late.

56:02.446 --> 56:04.578
You know what?
Dickie to the rescue.

56:04.622 --> 56:05.623
I've got an idea.

56:05.666 --> 56:07.755
Let me see that address.

56:10.236 --> 56:11.890
WOMAN:
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

56:11.933 --> 56:13.239
Oh, my God,
there's a fire

56:13.282 --> 56:16.677
at the McHenry house,
368 North Elmo Street!

56:16.721 --> 56:17.896
[falsetto]:
Hurry!

56:17.939 --> 56:19.637
[fire truck honks]

56:19.680 --> 56:22.248
[siren wailing]

56:24.032 --> 56:25.686
Follow those fire trucks.

56:25.730 --> 56:27.471
Come on, Mommy.

56:27.514 --> 56:30.169
Unbelievable.

56:31.170 --> 56:33.607
You think a false alarm
is funny?

56:33.651 --> 56:35.696
You think it's okay
to phone in a fire?!

56:35.740 --> 56:36.958
Well, it's called

56:37.002 --> 56:38.133
being aggressive towards
your career, you know?

56:38.177 --> 56:39.352
You want something,
you gotta work at it.

56:39.396 --> 56:40.745
That's day-one stuff.

56:40.788 --> 56:42.224
You know what, no matter
how much you want something,

56:42.268 --> 56:43.443
you don't trample others
to get it,

56:43.487 --> 56:45.314
and you certainly
don't break the law.

56:45.358 --> 56:47.882
You've been nothing
but a disruptive influence,

56:47.926 --> 56:49.057
ever since you got here.

56:49.101 --> 56:51.233
Well, I'm learning,
and that's the point,

56:51.277 --> 56:53.758
[sobbing]:
I got nowhere else to go.

56:53.801 --> 56:56.064
I got nowhere
else to go!

56:56.108 --> 56:57.370
Why does that sound familiar?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.850
It's from An Officer
and a Gentleman.

56:58.893 --> 57:00.199
That's what
Richard Gere said.

57:00.242 --> 57:01.679
See? I'm a good actor.

57:01.722 --> 57:03.202
That's it! Out!

57:03.245 --> 57:06.074
I don't care what arrangement
you have with my husband.

57:06.118 --> 57:07.685
I won't tolerate
this anymore!

57:07.728 --> 57:08.468
No, come on.

57:08.512 --> 57:09.730
Dickie, no...!
Please!

57:09.774 --> 57:11.210
No! Oh!
Listen..

57:11.253 --> 57:13.865
[liquid dripping rapidly]

57:13.908 --> 57:15.475
[gasps]

57:15.519 --> 57:16.215
Oh, no!

57:16.258 --> 57:19.523
Dickie! [groans]

57:31.752 --> 57:32.971
[loud clang]

57:33.014 --> 57:36.104
Go! Go! Go, now!I mean it!
DICKIE: Hey, ow!

57:36.148 --> 57:39.238
You don't understand,
I know I'm screwed up.

57:39.281 --> 57:40.326
I have no center.

57:40.369 --> 57:41.719
I'm completely lost.

57:41.762 --> 57:44.461
Look at me, I'm a massive
failure as a human being.

57:44.504 --> 57:45.853
I wear gloves 24 hours a day.

57:45.897 --> 57:49.683
Why? Because I'm afraid
to physically touch anything

57:49.727 --> 57:50.771
or anyone.

57:50.815 --> 57:52.686
I don't want people
to look in my eyes

57:52.730 --> 57:55.515
'cause they'll realize
there's nothing there.

57:55.559 --> 57:58.170
I'm a complete and total mess.

57:58.213 --> 57:59.606
Grace, do you think
you could take

57:59.650 --> 58:02.130
your little dysfunctional
family fight inside?

58:02.174 --> 58:04.393
We don't need to see
your dirty laundry.

58:04.437 --> 58:06.004
Mrs. Gertrude, please, okay?

58:06.047 --> 58:07.048
Just blow it out your ass!

58:07.092 --> 58:08.789
[gasps]
This is between me

58:08.833 --> 58:11.618
and my family.

58:11.662 --> 58:11.705
Mom, that was awesome!
Mom, that was awesome!

58:13.751 --> 58:15.970
DICKIE:
Wait a second.

58:16.014 --> 58:17.363
Why did you say that?

58:17.406 --> 58:20.409
Is that because I told you
to stand up for yourself?

58:20.453 --> 58:22.194
It is.
See, Grace?

58:22.237 --> 58:23.369
I-I'm not totally useless.

58:23.412 --> 58:25.284
Dickie, this whole thing
is just crazy.

58:25.327 --> 58:27.634
I mean, you can't just
observe a family

58:27.678 --> 58:28.896
and learn how to be.

58:28.940 --> 58:30.811
You know, it's not like
monkey-see, monkey-do.

58:30.855 --> 58:31.856
It's more than that.

58:31.899 --> 58:33.814
You don't understand.
I'm desperate.

58:33.858 --> 58:36.513
If I become a star again,
everyone will come back.

58:36.556 --> 58:38.384
My mom will come home,
just like before.

58:38.427 --> 58:40.647
Dickie, it's not supposed
to work that way.

58:40.691 --> 58:46.348
I know, but can't I hope
for anything different?

58:49.700 --> 58:52.180
Grace, please.

58:53.399 --> 58:54.400
I need this part.

58:54.443 --> 58:55.619
I need it so bad,

58:55.662 --> 58:58.012
that I don't know
if I can go on without it.

58:58.056 --> 59:00.275
SALLY:
Hey, Mom?

59:00.319 --> 59:02.364
Maybe we could
give Dickie

59:02.408 --> 59:03.931
just one last chance?

59:03.975 --> 59:05.716
SAM:
Yeah, Mom.

59:05.759 --> 59:07.326
He could do better.

59:07.369 --> 59:10.198
I mean,
if we help.

59:10.808 --> 59:11.852
[low whining]

59:11.896 --> 59:13.419
SAM: What's Popeye
got in his mouth?

59:13.462 --> 59:15.682
My gosh,
it's a dead rabbit.

59:15.726 --> 59:16.596
Oh, my God.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.554
It's the Gertrudes' pet rabbit.

59:17.597 --> 59:20.034
Popeye killed
their pet rabbit.

59:20.078 --> 59:21.601
Popeye bad dog!

59:21.645 --> 59:22.559
SALLY:
What are we going to do?

59:22.602 --> 59:24.343
GRACE:
Oh, God. Oh, God.

59:24.386 --> 59:25.474
Popeye must have gotten

59:25.518 --> 59:26.388
into the backyard cage
and killed him.

59:26.432 --> 59:27.607
God, they're already
mad at us.

59:27.651 --> 59:29.217
Now we're in all kinds
of trouble.

59:29.261 --> 59:31.872
[whines]
DICKIE: Wait a second.

59:31.916 --> 59:32.873
We can fix this.

59:32.917 --> 59:34.266
Rub-a-dub-dub,
bunny in the tub.

59:34.309 --> 59:35.746
Do you think
we should shampoo it?

59:35.789 --> 59:39.053
Do you have any "Gee, Your Dead
Rabbit Smells Terrific"?

59:39.097 --> 59:39.793
Oh.

59:39.837 --> 59:40.881
No, but I
have V05.

59:40.925 --> 59:43.797
We'll put in
some leave-in conditioner

59:43.841 --> 59:44.755
and a protein pack.

59:44.798 --> 59:46.147
This thing will look
good as new

59:46.191 --> 59:48.541
[whispering]:
except for the being dead part.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.934
I think we better start
to blow-dry it soon.

59:49.977 --> 59:51.762
Then I'm going
to go get a brush.

59:51.805 --> 59:52.458
Hurry.

59:52.501 --> 59:53.372
Okay, tell you what.

59:53.415 --> 59:54.547
I'll put it back in the cage

59:54.591 --> 59:56.636
all clean and when
the Gertrudes come home,

59:56.680 --> 59:58.246
they open
the cage

59:58.290 --> 01:00:01.423
and they think it dies
of natural causes.

01:00:01.467 --> 01:00:02.860
It's the perfect plan.

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:05.645
You guys, the Gertrudes--
I think they're coming home.

01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:07.734
All right, let's go.
Okay, okay, dry it.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:08.779
Here, here.

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:09.562
Here we go.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.608
Dry it, dry
it, dry it.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:31.192
Okay, it's back in the cage.

01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:32.977
We're totally off the hook.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.066
Hey, what's in the cage?

01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:36.284
It's Peter! Oh, no!

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:37.677
Devil rabbit.

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:39.113
Devil rabbit,
devil rabbit!

01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:42.160
Mr. and Mrs. Gertrude,
what's wrong?

01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:43.814
Our pet bunny
died two days ago.

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:44.945
We buried it over there.

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:46.947
And now he's back in the cage!

01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:49.036
Oh, Satan
taunts us!

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.081
Oh, devil rabbit!

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:51.691
DICKIE:
That is a sign from hell!

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.954
It means move out of that house.

01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:55.129
Move!

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.304
Spirits of rabbits.

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.219
Devil rabbit!
Devil rabbit!

01:00:58.263 --> 01:01:00.047
Woo! Get out!

01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:03.268
[engine starts]

01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:05.792
DICKIE: There they go.
They're moving out.

01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:07.707
Devil rabbits!

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:08.969
Devil rabbits.

01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:10.797
[cheering]

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:12.669
[dog barks]

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.194
That was fun.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:19.414
So, can I stay?

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:27.509
DICKIE:
So those three bullies
don't bug you anymore?

01:01:27.553 --> 01:01:29.163
I knew it, they're morons.

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:30.382
[laughter]

01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:31.862
Hey, what do you call
this hairstyle again?

01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:32.601
The Tiger-Do.

01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:34.995
Looks cool, right, Sam?

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:35.779
Yeah, man.

01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:37.476
Bitchin' cool style, man.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:38.999
What's this one,
the porcupine? Oh, oh.

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:40.131
[laughter]

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:41.219
So, what do you want
to do today, Dickie?

01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:43.961
First up, teach me
how to ride a bike.

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:44.918
ALL:
Yeah!

01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:47.747
I'm pedaling.
I think I got it.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:48.792
Let him go.

01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:51.142
Go. Go. Go. Go.

01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:52.099
Go for it!

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:54.014
I'm doing it.

01:01:54.058 --> 01:01:55.886
[boys groan]

01:01:55.929 --> 01:01:57.104
Dickie, are you okay?

01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:58.715
DICKIE:
Ow!

01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:00.891
Who put that truck there?

01:02:00.934 --> 01:02:02.675
Are you all right?

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.374
Oh. I'm seeing birds and bells
and beautiful girls.

01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:08.550
Sam, front and center
on the double.

01:02:08.594 --> 01:02:10.683
GIRL:We're just moving in
to this house.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.337
Oh, well, we got
a new neighbor.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.078
What do you think
of that, Sam?

01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:15.340
[chuckles]

01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:18.169
Sam, you want to say hello
to the new neighbor?

01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:20.214
Hello.

01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:21.563
Hi.

01:02:21.607 --> 01:02:22.826
He had you at hello, didn't he?

01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:24.653
Listen, these guys
are teaching me

01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:26.612
how to ride a bike--
You want to come with?

01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:28.048
Sure.
All right, let's go.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:30.050
BOYS:
Yeah!

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:32.531
Whoa!

01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:34.576
Ow.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.230
This is gonna be

01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:38.363
My greatest day

01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:40.800
My greatest day...

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.889
[all groaning]

01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:46.023
My greatest day...

01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.590
[yells]

01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:51.811
This is gonna be
my greatest day...

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.378
Oh-oh.

01:02:53.421 --> 01:02:56.294
Did you ever have such a bad
wipe-out you don't even feel it?

01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:58.513
That wasn't one of them.

01:02:58.557 --> 01:03:00.515
My greatest day!

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.300
[barking]

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:03.257
Here you go, guys.

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:04.432
Thanks, Mrs. Finney.

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:05.433
Thanks a lot.

01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:06.739
You okay?

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.219
I munched it out there.

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:09.220
You're all right.

01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:10.525
So you're really
going to help me?

01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:12.005
Yes, of course
I'm going to help you.

01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:15.966
If someone doesn't step in soon,
you might kill yourself.

01:03:16.009 --> 01:03:17.054
Look, Dickie, you've

01:03:17.097 --> 01:03:18.403
been going about
this thing all wrong.

01:03:18.446 --> 01:03:19.970
You know, there's no rhyme
or reason to your plan.

01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:23.277
You're like a chicken running
around with its head cut off.

01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:26.280
A chicken with his head chopped
off, that's a good analogy.

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:27.455
Stop it.

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:28.195
Okay,

01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:29.283
but if you want my help,

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:31.111
you play by my rules
and my rules only.

01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:33.287
Okay?
So first, the gloves.

01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:35.028
Off they go.

01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:36.116
Wait a minute.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.552
Dickie, for this to work,

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:38.771
we've got to almost reboot you,
like a human computer.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.339
Not the gloves,
anything but the gloves.

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.296
Okay, well.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.384
Okay, okay.

01:03:43.428 --> 01:03:44.516
[sighs]

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:45.952
But I just want you to know

01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:47.649
that this is like me asking you
to take your top off.

01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:49.477
Which is crazy, right?

01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:50.957
Dickie.

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:52.045
Right.

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:55.527
[humming]

01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:59.618
[yelling]:
Oh, air... Ow.

01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:02.839
I don't like it.

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:03.970
Happy?

01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:06.059
Yes. See?

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:08.366
There are men in stilts
plastering in there.

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:10.150
Is this part
of your interior design thing?

01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:13.980
No, George, it was damaged
from the water bed accident.

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:16.678
Dickie what the hell
did you do to your hair?

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:19.333
Oh. I dyed it.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.552
It no come out so good.

01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:21.596
Look, it was my idea, okay?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.859
People were recognizing him

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.034
and he was being distracted
from his project.

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:26.558
He was going to do a commercial
for me, Grace.

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:29.517
George, he's already paying you
a lot of money

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:30.867
to be here,
isn't that enough?

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.173
I had a lot of plans for him.

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.348
He's a human being, okay?

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.524
He's not just some product
for you to use.

01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:38.004
GEORGE:
All right.

01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:42.356
Wow, I feel like you have
completely undermined me here.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.445
I'm going out.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:47.971
[door closes]

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:51.148
Oh, boy.

01:04:57.371 --> 01:05:01.375
That was, like, the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.160
What is?

01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:05.118
That I'm not some product.

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:07.164
Wow.

01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:12.125
Then, as Hallmark cards go,
you'd be easy to please.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.306
Listen I, I'm sorry George
is mad at you.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:20.394
Is that because of me?

01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:21.569
No, but that's good.

01:05:21.613 --> 01:05:24.050
You're starting to think
like a real kid.

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.966
Kids always think it's their
fault when parents split up.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:31.928
Is that what's going to
happen to you and George?

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:41.763
I don't know.

01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:44.070
You know, I do
everything I can think of

01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:47.421
to keep it together
for the kids.

01:05:47.465 --> 01:05:48.901
I'm a mom first, but...

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.557
George makes me feel so guilty
for even wanting a career,

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.560
you know, like it makes me
less of a mom.

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:57.257
Well,

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:58.563
I got news for you.

01:05:58.606 --> 01:06:02.784
They don't even write TV
moms as good as you are.

01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:04.221
Well now, we're even.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:08.834
Because that's the nicest
compliment I've ever heard.

01:06:12.664 --> 01:06:13.752
You know,

01:06:13.795 --> 01:06:16.102
we probably should
dye your hair back.

01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:17.321
Yeah.

01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:18.844
Well, since you're going
to be here a while,

01:06:18.887 --> 01:06:20.715
I think I should read
this script.

01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:23.283
See what it is
you want so badly.

01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:24.328
Please do.

01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:28.245
Maybe you can make
some sense of it.

01:06:28.288 --> 01:06:30.595
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:32.379
I don't know what to do.

01:06:32.423 --> 01:06:33.815
No gloves.

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:37.036
Don't need 'em.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.472
Dickie, you promised
to help me

01:06:38.516 --> 01:06:40.735
with my pep squad
tryouts.

01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:42.259
That pep squad spot's
got your name all over it.

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:45.436
Did I ever tell you I was a
backup dancer for Vanilla Ice?

01:06:45.479 --> 01:06:46.611
[chuckles]:
No way.

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:48.439
Oh, yeah,
I owe him a call.

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:49.483
[whines]

01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:52.356
[inaudible dialogue]

01:06:58.318 --> 01:06:59.841
Boom.

01:07:25.345 --> 01:07:26.694
We're right on time.

01:07:26.738 --> 01:07:28.957
Are you sure?
Yep, yep.

01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:30.481
All right.
Here we go.

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:32.135
You got the words down?

01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:33.310
I think so, yeah.

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:34.398
I think you do, too.

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:35.529
I drew this up
last night.

01:07:35.573 --> 01:07:38.054
These are your
dance steps.

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:41.361
WOMAN:
Okay, girls, come on, let's go.

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:42.580
It's time to start.

01:07:42.623 --> 01:07:45.757
Our first contestant
is Heather Bolin.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.021
Hey, Stallions,
I got a message for you.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.545
And it goes like this.

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:53.547
[dance music starts]

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:55.767
Oh

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:57.203
I, I

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.423
I

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:05.603
I wanna be bad with you,
baby

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:07.083
I, I...

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:07.953
I, I

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:13.306
I wanna be bad with you,
baby

01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:14.568
Do you

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:16.743
Understand what I need
from you?

01:08:16.787 --> 01:08:19.921
Just let me be the girl
to show you, you

01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:23.403
Everything that she can be
is everything that I can be

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:24.578
I wanna be

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:25.492
My turn

01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:28.015
Let me let you know
that I can

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.756
Promise that I won't do that

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:33.631
So, boy, I-I wanna be bad

01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:35.763
You make bad feel so good

01:08:35.807 --> 01:08:38.417
I'm losing all my cool

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:41.639
I'm about to break a rule

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:44.468
I, I wanna be bad.

01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:46.122
[music ends]

01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:46.904
Thank you.

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:50.126
[scattered applause]

01:08:51.562 --> 01:08:53.216
[coughs]:
Slut.

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:54.260
[clears throat]

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:58.917
Our next contestant,
Sally Finney.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.398
Have fun.
Just have fun, okay?

01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:03.356
You're good.
You know it.

01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:07.099
[music begins]

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:20.852
It is the night

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.941
My body's weak

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:24.812
I'm on the run

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:25.944
No time to sleep

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:28.859
I've got to ride

01:09:28.903 --> 01:09:30.992
Ride like the wind

01:09:31.036 --> 01:09:33.299
To be free again

01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:37.346
And I've got
such a long way to go

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.000
Such a long way to go

01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:42.656
To make it to the border
of Mexico

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.310
So I'll ride

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:46.312
Like the wind

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:48.401
Ride like the wind

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:51.883
Gonna ride like the wind

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:08.508
[music ends]

01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:11.163
Oh, that was great!

01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:16.821
Yeah!

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.039
That was perfect.

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.172
Sally, I'm so proud of you.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.521
Yippee!

01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:28.136
Oh, good morning, everybody.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.747
Ooh, I had a rough night.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:30.965
First time I tried

01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:33.490
sleeping without my
gloves on in ten years.

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:35.361
Insane in the membrane.

01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:36.710
Hey, Dickie, okay.

01:10:36.754 --> 01:10:38.059
I saw Barbie outside and
I started talking to her,

01:10:38.103 --> 01:10:41.889
but I got all tongue-tied
and I wasn't making sense.

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:45.066
It sounded like you said,
"I love meat loaf."

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:46.677
Oh, so you could understand
that part.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.332
All right, I think that's going
to need a little work, buddy.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.637
Nothing against
meat loaf though.

01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:52.683
All right, why don't you
tots run off to school?

01:10:52.726 --> 01:10:54.511
I'm going to grab
a cup of java.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:55.512
Bye, Dickie.

01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:56.556
Bye, Dickie.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.427
Bye.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.385
Ooh, morning.

01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:00.256
Morning.

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.561
Never needed
this stuff more.

01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:02.736
No. No coffee.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.737
Kids don't drink coffee.

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:05.217
What? That's crazy.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.000
Juice.

01:11:06.044 --> 01:11:07.393
No, coffee in the morning.

01:11:07.437 --> 01:11:08.873
Shh. Dickie, I got to talk
to you about this script.

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:11.397
I know why you want to do this
movie so much.

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:14.748
I read it last night.
It's wonderful.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:15.749
Really?

01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:17.708
Please, can you
explain it to me?

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:19.187
Okay, Mr. Blake

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:22.408
discovers that heaven
is in his own backyard.

01:11:22.452 --> 01:11:23.366
Oh, wait.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:24.280
That's... I didn't
get that part.

01:11:24.323 --> 01:11:25.803
Like heaven,
like real heaven?

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.457
Yes, he's
this billionaire,

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.110
and he buys
this mysterious plot of land

01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:31.504
and he wants to build
the biggest house

01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:32.505
of all time on it.

01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:33.637
To be admired
by the whole world.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.073
Right on.
Well, that sounds like me.

01:11:35.116 --> 01:11:36.988
They should just
give me that part.

01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:38.250
Here's the problem.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.209
The bigger he builds
this giant house,

01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:45.692
the smaller heaven becomes
in his backyard.

01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:48.216
But he still has
a big house, right?

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.957
Have you ever seen MTV Cribs?

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:51.089
Tommy Lee has a sex room.

01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:53.134
And how come all the
rappers have a video

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.788
of Scarfacegoing all the time?

01:11:54.832 --> 01:11:56.355
Yeah, okay,
meanwhile,

01:11:56.399 --> 01:12:00.968
there's this woman, Esmerelda,
she's Mr. Blake's housekeeper,

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:03.841
and he falls madly
in love with her, right?

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:05.973
And then she dies.

01:12:10.587 --> 01:12:11.588
It is.

01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:14.199
Esmerelda goes to heaven...
you see,

01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:15.679
so by discovering true love,

01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:18.812
Mr. Blake's able to see
the heaven in his own backyard--

01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:20.988
the heaven that was
always there,

01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:22.338
only he couldn't see it--

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:24.427
so he tears down
this enormous house,

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:27.168
and he lives in his own backyard
in a little shack...

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:30.998
and it's all
to be near Esmerelda.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:32.086
Do you see, Dickie?

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:35.655
Do you see
what that story means?

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:37.831
I don't. No.

01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:39.616
I don't understand any of it.

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:41.052
[sighs]

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:42.836
Now, come on.
No!

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.968
No coffee.

01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:46.536
Here, have a nice bowl
of cereal instead.

01:12:46.579 --> 01:12:49.060
I've been drinking coffee
since I was three.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.409
I need a pick-me-up.

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:51.671
Too bad.

01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:53.804
Fine, cereal it is.

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:57.285
Oh, my gosh,
there's a prize inside.

01:12:58.896 --> 01:13:01.115
There's a prize...

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.857
Hey, you guys!

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:05.337
Hey, Dickie.Hey, Dickie.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.512
What do we have
planned next?

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.601
Oh, your Mom's got a lot
of stuff planned.

01:13:08.645 --> 01:13:09.863
Yeah.
Like what?

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:10.777
DICKIE:
Like what?

01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:13.780
SALLY:
You're crazy.

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:15.216
Whoa.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.175
Hello, Dickie.

01:13:17.218 --> 01:13:18.872
I've missed you.

01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:21.048
So, this guy
totally kidnapped me

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:22.528
when I was hitchhiking
that day,

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:24.530
and he was totally weird
with, like, this great haircut,

01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:28.404
so I was actually fooled
into thinking that he was okay,

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:29.883
you know?

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:30.971
So I finally escaped,

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:32.233
and I went back
to Dickie's apartment,

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:34.410
and Dickie was gone,
and I was, like,

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:38.239
"Well, I have got
to see my Dickie."

01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:40.111
DICKIE:
Um, right.

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.242
Uh, I...

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:43.506
I'm doing this thing here,
Cyndi, and...

01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:44.594
I just don't know

01:13:44.637 --> 01:13:46.291
if it's a great idea
if you're around,

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:48.728
only because I'm trying

01:13:48.772 --> 01:13:52.253
[clears throat]: Um, I'm thinking if we, uh,
up your rent

01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:55.300
a little bit, there's
really no reason why

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:57.694
Cyndi can't stay in the den.

01:13:57.737 --> 01:13:58.390
What?

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.784
Oh, Dickie, thank you.

01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:02.916
Thank you.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.701
Oh, baby.

01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:07.138
Wha... George?

01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:10.881
CYNDI:
Baby, I have saved up
a sexual experience

01:14:10.924 --> 01:14:12.143
of a lifetime for you,

01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:16.277
but first,
let's loosen things up a bit,

01:14:16.321 --> 01:14:18.279
light some candles,

01:14:18.323 --> 01:14:20.630
drink some champagne.

01:14:20.673 --> 01:14:21.631
Okay.

01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:23.110
Okay.

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:24.285
Do it.

01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:26.374
Oh, me, yeah.

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:33.730
Why do I keep my mind

01:14:33.773 --> 01:14:37.124
On you all the time

01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:41.085
And I don't even know you...

01:14:41.128 --> 01:14:42.608
Get out of here,

01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:43.957
gross dog.

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:45.742
[whines]

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:46.699
[grunts]

01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:50.224
Why do I feel this way?

01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:55.142
Thinking about you every day

01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:57.710
And I don't even know...
Hmm-mm-mm!

01:14:57.754 --> 01:14:58.581
Hmm-mm-mm!

01:14:58.624 --> 01:15:01.148
Taittinger, the finest bubbly.

01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:02.802
Do you like that painting?

01:15:02.846 --> 01:15:04.630
Huh?

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:05.675
[screams]:
Ow!

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:08.155
[laughs]:
Oh... whoo, got ya.

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:09.809
Got away from me.

01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:12.246
Ooh, this baby is wound up.

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:13.987
Incoming!

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:15.815
Ow.

01:15:15.859 --> 01:15:17.208
[hums]

01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:19.906
You're fine, you're fine.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:22.692
No blood. Cheers.

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:26.652
Nice.Yuck.

01:15:26.696 --> 01:15:31.048
So... relax, let me tell you
about this family.

01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:33.354
Oh... I'm having a good time.

01:15:33.398 --> 01:15:35.095
They are great.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:36.444
Well, George, he's the dad.

01:15:36.488 --> 01:15:40.361
He's a little... off,
but Sam-- he's a great kid.

01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:41.319
He... he's funny.

01:15:41.362 --> 01:15:42.581
He doesn't know
how great he is,

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:44.452
because he's always
getting bullied at school,

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:46.411
and it took away
all his confidence.

01:15:46.454 --> 01:15:48.195
He has a crush
on this girl next door,

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.545
and I'm helping him
with that, but...

01:15:49.588 --> 01:15:52.025
uh, you probably don't want
to hear all this.

01:15:52.069 --> 01:15:54.375
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

01:15:54.419 --> 01:15:56.508
And Sally is cute,
and smart, and funny,

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.336
and just the other day
I was telling her...

01:15:58.379 --> 01:16:00.468
Yeah? Wow, that's
really interesting,

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:03.471
um, but that Grace--
she's a real looker...

01:16:03.515 --> 01:16:06.213
in her own
way... I guess.

01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:08.302
Grace... Wow, I...

01:16:08.346 --> 01:16:11.349
Mom? I never thought
of her like that.

01:16:11.392 --> 01:16:14.221
[scoffs]:Yeah, right, like
you hadn't noticed?

01:16:14.265 --> 01:16:16.267
Come on, and you
think I didn't notice

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:18.008
that George is hot?

01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:19.792
You haven't
changed, Dickie.

01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:22.665
You just think
you have.

01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:26.886
So, are we going to do
this sex or not,

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:30.411
because I kind of want
to get it over with.

01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:31.543
Maybe we shouldn't, you know?

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:35.025
Maybe-maybe it's not
a good idea tonight.

01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.375
Wait, y-you're turning me down?

01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:39.420
Unbelievable.

01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:42.728
These yokels
are really getting to you.

01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.512
Okay, well,
if we're not doing it,

01:16:44.556 --> 01:16:47.733
will you at least
put out the damn candles?

01:16:47.777 --> 01:16:50.867
Oh, not this one.
It smells great.

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.259
This is sandalwood vanilla.

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:52.912
You'd love that.

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:54.218
Ooh!
[screams]

01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:54.958
Oh! Oh!

01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.655
Oh, oh!
Oh, my God.

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:58.570
CYNDI:
I'm on fire, you idiot!

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.832
DICKIE:
I'm sorry.

01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:01.791
[Cyndi whimpers]

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.664
Hey, pal.

01:17:08.058 --> 01:17:09.320
Up-bu-bu-bup, excuse me.

01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:11.931
I thought I told you
not to bother our customers.

01:17:11.975 --> 01:17:13.367
Hey, pal, I'm harmless.

01:17:13.411 --> 01:17:15.282
I just want to talk to Robbie
for, like, ten seconds.

01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:17.284
Jerry, Asto,
get rid of this guy.

01:17:17.328 --> 01:17:18.634
Beat it, pal.

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:19.460
Let's go.

01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:20.636
Oh, it's him!
It's Rob!

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.072
Hey, how you doing?
Nice to see you.

01:17:22.115 --> 01:17:23.551
Always a pleasure.
Love your car.

01:17:23.595 --> 01:17:25.553
Oh, yeah, we have,uh,
global warming...
I understand.

01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:28.992
Hey, Rob, it's me,
Sidney Wernick.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:30.297
Rob?

01:17:30.341 --> 01:17:31.777
Oh, he's getting away.

01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:33.387
Robbie! Rob!

01:17:33.431 --> 01:17:34.998
It's me,
Sidney Wernick.

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:36.826
I'm Dickie Roberts' agent.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:39.306
Give me five seconds.

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.786
DICKIE:
Yep, she's a cutie.

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:42.483
I'll give you that.

01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:43.310
A girl that pretty

01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:44.616
is never going
to like me.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.185
Come on, have you seen
Ric Ocasek from The Cars?

01:17:48.228 --> 01:17:49.839
That guy's rough.

01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:50.927
You're way ahead of him.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.363
Listen, all you got to do
is show her

01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:53.581
what a cool,
funny dude you are.

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:56.410
But... I'm not good at talking
like you are.

01:17:56.454 --> 01:17:58.108
Well, that's debatable.

01:17:58.151 --> 01:17:59.936
Let's talk to your mom about it.

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:01.111
Maybe she has some ideas.

01:18:01.154 --> 01:18:02.721
No, no. We can't talk
to a mom about this.

01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:05.115
This is stuff
a dad has to help me with,

01:18:05.158 --> 01:18:08.684
you know, man to man.

01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:16.387
DICKIE:
I got an idea.

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:19.042
Come here.

01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:21.348
[music playing]

01:18:21.392 --> 01:18:25.004
Ooh...

01:18:30.967 --> 01:18:39.932
Each day through my window,
I watch her as she passes by

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:46.373
To have a girl like her

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:51.770
Is truly a dream come true

01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:56.166
Out of all the fellas
in the world

01:18:56.209 --> 01:19:02.128
She belongs to me

01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:06.872
But it was
just my imagination

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:11.921
Running away with me

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.969
It was just my imagination

01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:22.453
Running away with me...

01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:25.021
Ho-ho, whoa, Sam!

01:19:25.064 --> 01:19:25.761
Whoa-whoa!

01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:26.413
[glass shattering]

01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:27.806
[cat howling]

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.547
Ow.

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:31.549
[screaming]

01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:32.680
Uh, Barbie...

01:19:32.724 --> 01:19:33.899
[objects clanging]

01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:36.423
[shouting]
[glass shattering]

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:40.079
Uh, Barbie, I was...
I was hoping

01:19:40.123 --> 01:19:41.080
you'd like to go

01:19:41.124 --> 01:19:42.952
to a movie with me.

01:19:42.995 --> 01:19:44.954
Yes, Sam, I'll go to a movie
with you.

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:47.565
[dog barking]
[tires screeching]

01:19:47.608 --> 01:19:49.349
Ooh...
[horn honks]

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:50.829
MAN:
Idiot!

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:53.440
[cow lowing]

01:19:53.484 --> 01:19:54.920
[groans]
Yeah, hey, wait,
hold on, here he is.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:58.402
Dickie, it's Sidney--
it sounds like something's
wrong.

01:19:58.445 --> 01:19:59.142
What?

01:19:59.185 --> 01:20:00.447
Hey, Sidney, what's up?

01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:02.841
Dickie, turn on the news.

01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:04.625
Famous director Rob Reiner
was the victim

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:06.366
of a road rage incident today
in Hollywood.

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:09.674
Witnesses say that Mr. Reiner
was stopped at a red light

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:12.459
when a large angry man
pulled Mr. Reiner

01:20:12.503 --> 01:20:14.026
out of his Honda inside

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:16.507
and began beating him
for well over a minute.

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:18.857
Mr. Reiner was rushed
to a nearby hospital,

01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:20.554
his only dazed words being,

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:25.777
"I have no idea what I did
to make that man so angry."

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:28.649
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:29.868
Dickie, I got you an audition.

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:32.131
You got me that audition?
How?

01:20:32.175 --> 01:20:36.570
Well, it's a long story,
but it's tomorrow at 3:00.

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:39.486
Tomorrow at 3:00?
I-I-I'm... I'll never be ready.

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:40.661
Well, you got to be ready,

01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:42.011
because the audition's
at the hospital,

01:20:42.054 --> 01:20:45.057
and then Rob's going under
for an operation.

01:20:45.101 --> 01:20:46.319
What, an operation?

01:20:46.363 --> 01:20:47.973
Well, anyway, long story short,

01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:53.065
Rob needs a kidney,
and I'm giving him one of mine.

01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:54.806
We swapped...

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.156
a kidney for an audition.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.680
You'd better get that job!

01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:01.595
[phone clicks]

01:21:01.639 --> 01:21:02.901
Holy crap.

01:21:02.945 --> 01:21:03.989
It's tomorrow.

01:21:04.033 --> 01:21:05.991
I'm not ready.

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:07.645
Wait.

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.082
I've got an idea.

01:21:10.126 --> 01:21:11.257
Okay, here we go.

01:21:11.301 --> 01:21:13.042
You're going to be ready,
Dickie.

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:14.043
This is the big one.

01:21:14.086 --> 01:21:15.087
It's Christmas morning.

01:21:15.131 --> 01:21:16.349
You're waking up excited.

01:21:16.393 --> 01:21:18.786
You think you heard reindeer
on the roof, okay?

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.963
All right, I'll be
down in a second.

01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:24.009
Mom, this was such a good idea
to help Dickie.

01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:26.620
Do you think he could pretend
it's Christmas even though

01:21:26.664 --> 01:21:28.492
it's not for a while?
Sure, he can,

01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:29.710
and if coming
down the stairs

01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:31.060
and seeing his
first red bicycle

01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:34.802
helps him with his
acting somehow, then...

01:21:34.846 --> 01:21:36.892
huh?

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:39.155
He really is special, isn't he?

01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:40.547
Who would've thought?

01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:42.854
Yeah, I mean how is it possible
that Stranger Danger

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.725
turned out to be so cool?

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:45.944
SAM:
Hey, where's Cyndi?

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.467
I thought she would've
helped him with this.

01:21:47.511 --> 01:21:49.252
[clears throat]:
Slut.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:51.515
...everybody knows

01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:53.386
A turkey and some...

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:56.259
DICKIE:
Here I come.

01:21:57.434 --> 01:22:05.094
Help to make
the season bright

01:22:05.137 --> 01:22:07.270
Tiny tots...

01:22:07.313 --> 01:22:08.793
Whoa, a bicycle.

01:22:08.836 --> 01:22:16.975
Will find it hard to sleep
tonight

01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:23.329
They know that Santa's
on his way

01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:29.770
He's loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh

01:22:30.641 --> 01:22:33.252
And every mother's child...

01:22:33.296 --> 01:22:34.732
You guys...

01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:37.865
that was... that was great
of you to do this for me.

01:22:37.909 --> 01:22:41.608
Thanks for being so cool
to put this together, but...

01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:43.045
But what?

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:47.788
but... I guess it's true
you can never go home again.

01:22:47.832 --> 01:22:50.008
I mean, I missed out
on the real thing,

01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:52.880
and I don't... I don't think
I'll ever get it back.

01:22:52.924 --> 01:22:56.623
Well, maybe you didn't get
something back.

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:59.713
Maybe you got something
you never had.

01:22:59.757 --> 01:23:02.629
Dickie...

01:23:02.673 --> 01:23:05.893
...you've been so good
with my family.

01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.156
You've been so good to me.

01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:09.114
You're so different
than the angry, weird guy

01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:12.465
who landed on our doorstep
a month ago.

01:23:12.509 --> 01:23:15.207
You're a joy
to have around...

01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:17.993
so... as a present

01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:22.171
for all that you've
done to help us.

01:23:23.868 --> 01:23:27.176
This isn't part
of your experiment.

01:23:27.219 --> 01:23:30.048
I got this gift for you.

01:23:39.797 --> 01:23:42.408
Candyland.

01:23:42.452 --> 01:23:45.281
You remembered?

01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:48.197
That's what moms do.

01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:58.946
You grew up, Dickie Roberts.

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.265
That's so unfair!

01:24:13.309 --> 01:24:16.181
[chattering]

01:24:20.185 --> 01:24:23.493
I'm really sorry
that you're here, Mr. Reiner.

01:24:23.536 --> 01:24:25.103
Thanks, but why are you sorry?

01:24:25.147 --> 01:24:29.412
It's not like you had anything
to do with that guy going nuts.

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.457
All right.

01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:32.458
Okay.

01:24:32.502 --> 01:24:33.633
You ready to read?

01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:36.854
We-we don't have much time here.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:42.599
I think I'm ready.

01:24:42.642 --> 01:24:44.427
Woo! I got the part!

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:46.168
Yeah. Woo.

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.170
I got it, baby!

01:24:48.213 --> 01:24:50.302
Come here, doggy.

01:24:50.346 --> 01:24:51.869
I got...

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:54.785
Congratulations.

01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:55.916
[coughs]

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.049
Is it hot
out here?

01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.398
Oh.

01:24:59.442 --> 01:25:01.357
Oh.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.533
I got it.

01:25:03.576 --> 01:25:05.535
You guys, I got it.

01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:07.406
Where is everybody?

01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:09.234
You guys, are you kidding me?

01:25:09.278 --> 01:25:11.889
I got it. It worked.

01:25:11.932 --> 01:25:14.413
Where are you?

01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:15.588
There you are.

01:25:15.632 --> 01:25:17.112
I got the part!

01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:17.764
Oh!

01:25:17.808 --> 01:25:19.549
That's wonderful.

01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:23.118
Something's wrong.

01:25:25.816 --> 01:25:27.774
Oh, George and Cyndi?

01:25:27.818 --> 01:25:30.299
George and Cyndi?

01:25:30.342 --> 01:25:33.171
They ran off together?

01:25:33.215 --> 01:25:35.130
So we're going
to film in Hawaii.

01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:38.002
I'm going to be there,
like, six months.

01:25:38.045 --> 01:25:41.701
I sacrificed so
much to get this.

01:25:41.745 --> 01:25:44.182
Sidney gave
up his kidney.

01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:46.445
I'll send you
guys some money.

01:25:46.489 --> 01:25:47.751
No. No, Dickie.

01:25:47.794 --> 01:25:49.796
Please, don't worry about us.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.147
You're not responsible for us.

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:54.584
I sometimes feel like I am.
I mean...

01:25:54.627 --> 01:25:55.585
George didn't just

01:25:55.628 --> 01:25:57.064
suddenly lose his head,
you know?

01:25:57.108 --> 01:26:00.851
Something like this was going
to happen sooner or later.

01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:03.419
Dickie, it's not
your fault.

01:26:03.462 --> 01:26:06.639
It's his fault.

01:26:06.683 --> 01:26:10.339
Did she take the rest
of your money?

01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:13.603
Yeah.

01:26:13.646 --> 01:26:16.910
Yeah, but I don't
care, you know?

01:26:18.085 --> 01:26:19.478
It was never
about the money.

01:26:19.522 --> 01:26:23.917
It was about something more
than that.

01:26:25.528 --> 01:26:29.140
And now you have that, right?

01:26:29.575 --> 01:26:30.881
Yeah.

01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:34.450
I have everything
I've always wanted.

01:26:37.975 --> 01:26:40.369
And I have you to thank.

01:26:40.412 --> 01:26:42.545
Dickie.

01:26:44.938 --> 01:26:47.637
Go find your happiness.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.422
Wherever that takes you.

01:26:55.993 --> 01:26:59.126
[all talking at once]

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:12.879
Dickie, Dickie...

01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:14.316
It'll just take one
minute of your time.

01:27:14.359 --> 01:27:15.882
What does it feel like
to be living a Hollywood dream?

01:27:15.926 --> 01:27:17.406
WOMAN:
Dickie, over here.

01:27:17.449 --> 01:27:20.060
We want to interview
the comeback kid
for Hollywood Scene.

01:27:20.104 --> 01:27:21.366
Sally, come on.

01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:22.498
JANN CARL:
Dickie,

01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:24.108
Jann Carl,
from Entertainment Tonight.

01:27:24.151 --> 01:27:26.719
Look, we want
to do an exclusive interview.

01:27:26.763 --> 01:27:27.633
It's an amazing story.

01:27:27.677 --> 01:27:30.114
You have climbed your way back.

01:27:41.952 --> 01:27:43.736
I had visions, I was in them

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:47.218
I was looking
into the mirror

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.873
To see a little bit clearer

01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:54.921
The rottenness
and evil in me

01:27:54.965 --> 01:27:56.271
Fingertips have memories

01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:59.926
Mine can't forget the curves
of your body

01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:03.321
And when I feel
a bit naughty

01:28:03.365 --> 01:28:06.803
I run it up the flagpole
and see who salutes

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:08.587
But no one ever does

01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:09.675
I'm not sick...

01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.024
MAN: Folks, it looks like

01:28:11.068 --> 01:28:12.765
we'll be departing here
on time today.

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:14.289
We anticipate a smooth trip
to the Hawaiian islands,

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:16.813
and we appreciate you flying
with us here

01:28:16.856 --> 01:28:18.205
on Christmas Eve. Ho, Ho, Ho.

01:28:18.249 --> 01:28:22.166
Sit back, relax
and enjoy your trip.

01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:25.561
did you want coffee,
tea... or me?

01:28:25.604 --> 01:28:26.475
[laughter]

01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:27.650
Oh, Brittany,
you are wicked.

01:28:27.693 --> 01:28:29.608
Mr. Roberts can't join
the mile-high club.

01:28:29.652 --> 01:28:30.783
We're still
on the ground.

01:28:30.827 --> 01:28:31.741
Thanks anyway, ladies.

01:28:31.784 --> 01:28:33.133
I'm just going
to study my lines.

01:28:33.177 --> 01:28:35.745
Oh yeah, we heard about
the movie and the director.

01:28:35.788 --> 01:28:36.789
You're a huge star.

01:28:36.833 --> 01:28:38.400
So tell us-- what's
the movie about?

01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:39.923
We are huge fans.
Huge.

01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:41.751
Huge. Seriously
huge fans.

01:28:41.794 --> 01:28:42.969
Sick.
We love your work.

01:28:43.013 --> 01:28:44.362
I mean, but normal.

01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:45.842
Totally normal.

01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:48.671
And in the movie, he wants
to build the biggest house

01:28:48.714 --> 01:28:50.368
in the whole world,
because he thinks

01:28:50.412 --> 01:28:52.457
it will make him happy,
but it doesn't.

01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:53.240
It doesn't?

01:28:53.284 --> 01:28:55.504
Big houses make me horny.

01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:57.810
Well, he used
to think the same way,

01:28:57.854 --> 01:28:59.290
but then he falls in love.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:00.378
Is she a flight attendant?

01:29:00.422 --> 01:29:02.249
Does she get to live
in that big house?

01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:03.425
'Cause I met this producer...

01:29:03.468 --> 01:29:04.904
No, no, no. Listen, listen.

01:29:04.948 --> 01:29:08.038
He finds love, and he realizes
that love is everything.

01:29:08.081 --> 01:29:10.649
Not the biggest house
in the world,

01:29:10.693 --> 01:29:12.042
not being a billionaire.

01:29:12.085 --> 01:29:14.697
He finds out what he wanted
wasn't what he needed,

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:20.093
and what he needed was
in his own backyard.

01:29:20.137 --> 01:29:23.967
It was right there
in his own backyard.

01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:30.234
Lying in bed
with the radio on...

01:29:30.277 --> 01:29:31.235
I didn't have the money

01:29:31.278 --> 01:29:32.758
for real presents
this year, okay?

01:29:32.802 --> 01:29:34.369
So, Sam, if what I got you is
not what you really wanted,

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:36.022
or you're disappointed,
we can return it.

01:29:36.066 --> 01:29:38.764
And Sally, the same goes
for you, all right?

01:29:38.808 --> 01:29:39.678
Whoa.

01:29:39.722 --> 01:29:42.377
Whoa. Look at
all this stuff.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.595
GRACE:
Where did all this come from?

01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:46.990
[barks]
When will I see you again...

01:29:47.033 --> 01:29:47.773
Dickie!

01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:48.818
Dickie,
you're here.

01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:50.123
[Dickie laughs]
What are you

01:29:50.167 --> 01:29:51.516
doing here?

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.256
I can't believe it.

01:29:52.299 --> 01:29:53.170
Hey.
Merry Christmas.

01:29:53.213 --> 01:29:54.563
Dickie, what
about your movie?

01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:57.174
Well, sometimes in Hollywood
if you say no,

01:29:57.217 --> 01:29:59.219
it only makes them
want you more.

01:29:59.263 --> 01:30:00.656
So you're
staying, Dickie?

01:30:00.699 --> 01:30:03.702
If your Mom's okay with it,
I'd like room and board

01:30:03.746 --> 01:30:04.747
for quite a while.

01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:08.011
I didn't know
it would be so strong

01:30:08.054 --> 01:30:11.536
Waiting and wondering
about you...
Oh.

01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:12.972
Okay!

01:30:13.016 --> 01:30:15.410
NARRATOR: And so Dickie Roberts'
dreams did come true,

01:30:15.453 --> 01:30:17.455
But in a way he never
could have imagined.

01:30:17.499 --> 01:30:20.719
He created a sitcom
based on his exploits,

01:30:20.763 --> 01:30:23.069
and, with Leif Garrett starring
as the Dickie character,

01:30:23.113 --> 01:30:25.855
the show quickly climbed
into the top ten,

01:30:25.898 --> 01:30:27.117
winning four Emmys.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.424
Here's Dickie and his agent,
Sidney Wernick.

01:30:29.467 --> 01:30:31.121
I may have to pee
every 45 minutes,

01:30:31.164 --> 01:30:33.079
but at least I get to pee
in a gold toilet.

01:30:33.123 --> 01:30:34.516
Dickie didn't forget
his friends,

01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:37.910
and they enjoy a weekly spot
on the popular sitcom.

01:30:37.954 --> 01:30:40.260
With Grace in charge
of set design,

01:30:40.304 --> 01:30:41.697
Sam writing jokes,

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.525
and Sally becoming the youngest
choreographer in TV,

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:46.441
Dickie keeps the show
a real family affair.

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:49.095
Brick wall, waterfall,
Danny thinks

01:30:49.139 --> 01:30:50.923
he's got it all,
but he don't.

01:30:50.967 --> 01:30:51.837
And we do.

01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:53.273
So boom with that attitude.

01:30:53.317 --> 01:30:54.492
A Reese's Pieces, 7 UP.

01:30:54.536 --> 01:30:56.712
Mess with us, we mess you up.

01:30:56.755 --> 01:30:58.104
And cut. So good.

01:30:58.148 --> 01:31:00.803
[all talking at once]

01:31:00.846 --> 01:31:03.327
They're driving me crazy.

01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:04.589
NARRATOR:
As for George and Cyndi,

01:31:04.633 --> 01:31:06.939
their ill-fated romance
didn't quite work out.

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.985
Would you make
yourself useful

01:31:09.028 --> 01:31:11.248
and get me a drink?

01:31:13.903 --> 01:31:15.774
How about some champagne?

01:31:15.818 --> 01:31:17.776
Whatever.

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.169
[grunts, thudding]

01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:21.519
The bottle impact led
to a case of walking amnesia,

01:31:21.563 --> 01:31:25.001
and George was last seen
hitchhiking into the desert

01:31:25.044 --> 01:31:26.132
to find himself.

01:31:26.176 --> 01:31:30.136
[chanting]

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.357
Cyndi, soon after,
begged Dickie for a job.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.402
He gave her a guest part
on his show,

01:31:35.446 --> 01:31:39.494
on the episode titled
"Cyndi Gets Poison Oak."

01:31:39.537 --> 01:31:42.322
Its success led to a spin-off
for Cyndi called,

01:31:42.366 --> 01:31:45.021
The Bitch Who Didn't Know
She Was a Bitch.

01:31:45.064 --> 01:31:48.241
As for Dickie Roberts,
millions of Americans tuned in

01:31:48.285 --> 01:31:49.504
to the sitcom's wedding show

01:31:49.547 --> 01:31:52.985
which reflected Dickie's
real-life marriage

01:31:53.029 --> 01:31:55.031
to the love of his life, Grace.

01:31:55.074 --> 01:31:56.249
The old saying goes,

01:31:56.293 --> 01:31:57.599
"There's no business
like show business,"

01:31:57.642 --> 01:32:00.645
but as the incredible saga
of "Dickie Roberts,

01:32:00.689 --> 01:32:04.257
Former Child Star," shows us,
the more apt saying is,

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.303
"There's no love
like real love."

01:32:06.346 --> 01:32:09.349
This has been the story
of Dickie Roberts:

01:32:09.393 --> 01:32:10.699
The E! True Hollywood Story.

01:32:10.742 --> 01:32:12.657
Sooner or later,
love is gonna get ya

01:32:12.701 --> 01:32:17.140
Sooner or later,
girl, you got to give in

01:32:17.183 --> 01:32:19.272
Sooner or later...

01:32:19.316 --> 01:32:22.493
[piano plays]

01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:30.196
Former child stars
are people, too

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:36.202
They're the same as you,
and you and you

01:32:36.246 --> 01:32:39.554
So we asked this simple question

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:44.559
How can it be
that you occasionally

01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:47.562
Don't respect their dignity?

01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:51.435
'Cause as they make
their way through life

01:32:51.478 --> 01:32:54.569
Long after the spotlight's faded

01:32:54.612 --> 01:32:56.701
There are things some of you do

01:32:56.745 --> 01:33:01.314
That make them want
to be sedated

01:33:01.358 --> 01:33:03.969
We loved being child stars

01:33:04.013 --> 01:33:07.103
On your television

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:09.018
But please stop giving us crap

01:33:09.061 --> 01:33:13.631
Or we'll have
a head-on collision

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:20.246
Thank you for letting
me in your living rooms

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:25.251
To entertain you before bed

01:33:25.295 --> 01:33:30.082
But if one more person
calls me Marcia

01:33:30.126 --> 01:33:32.781
I'll bust his fucking head

01:33:32.824 --> 01:33:38.264
She's very grateful,
just like she said

01:33:38.308 --> 01:33:41.354
But please don't call her Marcia

01:33:41.398 --> 01:33:43.835
Or she'll bust
your freaking head

01:33:43.879 --> 01:33:46.621
Yeah, I'd rather be
called Marcia then Screech.

01:33:46.664 --> 01:33:52.278
So I'm sitting alone in Arby's

01:33:52.322 --> 01:33:58.067
I get questions
that make me see red

01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:59.111
Hey, Eddie?

01:33:59.155 --> 01:34:00.678
Where's Herman Munster?

01:34:00.722 --> 01:34:04.508
Well, pal, for ten years,
he's been dead

01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:07.076
They ask,
"Hey, Lucy, where's J.R.?"

01:34:07.119 --> 01:34:08.468
Come on, y'all, be realistic.

01:34:08.512 --> 01:34:10.993
One more "Hey, Joanie,
where's Chachi,"

01:34:11.036 --> 01:34:12.081
and I'll go ballistic.

01:34:12.124 --> 01:34:15.084
Our costars are not
on our speed dial

01:34:15.127 --> 01:34:16.476
So please don't ask

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.871
Or take that phone and shove it

01:34:19.915 --> 01:34:24.006
Right up your dumb fat ass

01:34:24.049 --> 01:34:26.486
No, we don't ride in fancy limos

01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:29.664
Private jets, they're not for us

01:34:29.707 --> 01:34:32.710
So you may see us driving Neons

01:34:32.754 --> 01:34:35.408
Or riding the Greyhound bus

01:34:35.452 --> 01:34:38.977
Yeah, we live
just like all of you

01:34:39.021 --> 01:34:41.197
So don't call us losers

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.982
Or we'll punch you
with so many rights

01:34:44.026 --> 01:34:45.505
You'll be begging for lefts

01:34:45.549 --> 01:34:50.989
[voice breaking]:
And beggars can't be choosers

01:34:51.033 --> 01:34:54.906
[screams]

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:59.737
[guitar solo]

01:35:01.608 --> 01:35:07.223
I was on Teen Beat
with Michael Jackson

01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:11.401
Now he's bigger, I suppose

01:35:11.444 --> 01:35:12.750
Yeah, yeah

01:35:12.794 --> 01:35:16.754
Though he may be
a multi-zillionaire

01:35:16.798 --> 01:35:20.410
At least I still have my nose

01:35:20.453 --> 01:35:22.455
At least we're not crazy

01:35:22.499 --> 01:35:25.589
We don't sleep with chimpanzees

01:35:25.632 --> 01:35:28.113
We don't bleach our skin

01:35:28.157 --> 01:35:30.376
Or dangle babies from balconies

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:36.208
We loved being child stars
on your television

01:35:36.252 --> 01:35:38.602
But misbehaving,
we'll bust your head

01:35:38.645 --> 01:35:41.039
Gee, Wally,
was it something they said?

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:45.217
Child stars on your television

01:35:45.261 --> 01:35:46.784
Most of us have nothing to lose

01:35:46.828 --> 01:35:49.700
So we'll put your butt
on the 5:00 news

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:53.443
Child stars on your television

01:35:53.486 --> 01:35:55.575
We don't know karate,
but we do know crazy

01:35:55.619 --> 01:35:58.317
We'll beat you so bad,
your future will be hazy

01:35:58.361 --> 01:36:01.886
Child stars on your television

01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:04.280
Don't ever say,
"Didn't you used to be... ?"

01:36:04.323 --> 01:36:07.065
Or I'll put your head
through a vintage TV

01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:11.069
Child stars on your television

01:36:11.113 --> 01:36:12.679
Eight rehabs isn't enough

01:36:12.723 --> 01:36:15.465
But I've done and seen
the most killer stuff

01:36:15.508 --> 01:36:19.077
Child stars on your television

01:36:19.121 --> 01:36:21.079
You want an autograph
but I'm a tell you this

01:36:21.123 --> 01:36:23.821
Don't ask a brother
when he's taking a piss

01:36:23.865 --> 01:36:27.607
Child stars on your television

01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:29.696
You can dance like me,
you can dance like Mickey

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:33.875
I'll hurt you real bad,
you can take it from Kenickie

01:36:33.918 --> 01:36:36.965
Now of course
we've been kidding

01:36:37.008 --> 01:36:38.444
This has all been in fun

01:36:38.488 --> 01:36:45.277
We're happy you still love us,
after our shows have gone

01:36:45.321 --> 01:36:49.455
But please just follow
our simple rules

01:36:49.499 --> 01:36:52.110
Or we'll beat you
like rented mules.

01:36:52.154 --> 01:36:54.069
[laughs]

01:36:54.112 --> 01:37:00.597
We loved being child stars
on your television

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.993
Child stars

01:37:05.036 --> 01:37:05.863
Child stars.

01:37:05.907 --> 01:37:08.823
[applause and cheering]

01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:11.347
Oh, oh

01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:14.176
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

01:37:14.219 --> 01:37:16.656
Oh-oh, oh, oh

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:20.660
I'm a former childhood star

01:37:20.704 --> 01:37:26.144
If you think you know me,
take another look

01:37:26.188 --> 01:37:27.754
I'm not what you think

01:37:27.798 --> 01:37:31.715
The heather smile,
the bows I took

01:37:31.758 --> 01:37:34.544
Don't misunderstand me

01:37:34.587 --> 01:37:37.329
Please don't get me wrong

01:37:37.373 --> 01:37:39.679
I wouldn't change a thing

01:37:39.723 --> 01:37:43.379
I'm happy to sing one more song

01:37:43.422 --> 01:37:46.121
Still I wonder

01:37:46.164 --> 01:37:49.167
DAVID SPADE: All right you guys,
thanks for coming.

01:37:49.211 --> 01:37:50.212
Let's skedoodle.

01:37:50.255 --> 01:37:51.691
All right,
that's seriously the end.

01:37:51.735 --> 01:37:52.910
People in the back, beat it.

01:37:52.954 --> 01:37:53.911
We know you left your popcorn.

01:37:53.955 --> 01:37:55.304
That's fine.
Someone will get it.

01:37:55.347 --> 01:37:58.350
And quit pretending like
you're reading the credits.

01:37:58.394 --> 01:37:59.351
They're so small,

01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:00.526
and we're pushing
them by so fast.

01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:02.659
We don't even know
who these people are.

01:38:02.702 --> 01:38:04.052
It's some contract thing.

01:38:04.095 --> 01:38:05.183
[passing wind]

01:38:05.227 --> 01:38:06.358
Who was that?

01:38:06.402 --> 01:38:07.533
Was that one of you guys,
or was that me?

01:38:07.577 --> 01:38:09.144
[laughs]:That was me.

01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:10.493
Got a little bite in it.

01:38:10.536 --> 01:38:13.061
Come on, that's funny.

01:38:13.104 --> 01:38:15.977
[closing door]
