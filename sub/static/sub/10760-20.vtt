[DAPHNE LAUGHING]

00:09.500 --> 00:10.800
DAPHNE: Hello.
NILES: Hey.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.600
Ah, the weekend warriors
have returned.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.700
You better watch out, Dr. Crane.
I'm getting pretty good at kickboxing.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.800
It's true, it's true. She hits so hard,
they call her the British Pound.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.700
You hit pretty hard yourself there,
Nails.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.300
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.900
- Nails?
- Oh, you scratch one guy...

00:30.000 --> 00:32.600
Oh, my electrolytes are plummeting.
Care to join me in a sherry?

00:32.800 --> 00:35.600
Well, actually, I'd love to, Niles,
but I'm off to see Dr. Tewksbury.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.600
Oh. I didn't realise
your mentor was still in town.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.800
Yes, and because of it,
I've been the recipient

00:41.000 --> 00:43.600
of some informal therapy.
It's really been quite enlightening.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.200
You know, I consider myself lucky
to be in the hands of such a master.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.500
NILES:
Mm.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.000
Well, I'm happy for you, Frasier.
He is a gifted psychiatrist.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.800
Even if I don't share
your godlike worship of him.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.200
Well, I simply have
a healthy respect for the man, Niles.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.900
It's hardly worship.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.100
Oh, please. You're one step away from
seeing his image appear in a tortilla.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.100
- Niles, thank heavens you're still here.
- Uh, what's wrong?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.500
- You can't go to Nervosa today.
- Why not?

01:09.800 --> 01:12.300
I had a psychic vision that
something bad's gonna happen to you.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.400
- Oh, come on, Daphne.
- Niles, I'm serious.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.000
I know you don't believe in visions,
but it's important to me.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.400
Promise me you won't go.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.000
Well, all right, if it means
that much to you, I won't go.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.800
- I'll go straight home.
- Thank you.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.900
I feel much better.
I'll see you later.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.000
Wow, that was scary.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.400
Don't tell me
you believe in that stuff.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.300
No, I mean the way
she can manipulate you like that.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.300
Oh. Please,
I was just being diplomatic.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.200
FRASIER:
Is it difficult to kickbox without a spine?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.200
NILES:
You're gonna find out.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.800
- Hello, Frasier.
- Oh, hi, Roz.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.000
Oh, been on a shopping spree,
I see.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.200
Yes, Alice is visiting her grandmother
for the week.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.200
- So I finally have some time to myself.
- Oh.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.900
It is great shopping without her
pulling down a display rack.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.000
Not only that, I actually woke up today
without someone jumping on my bed

02:08.300 --> 02:10.500
and sticking her little fingers
up my nose.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.400
And I didn't have to spend
half the morning

02:12.700 --> 02:15.500
combing knots
out of that little girl's curls.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.500
- Give Alice my love.
- Thank you, I will.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.100
Psst. Frasier.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.300
- Can you get me a latte?
- Well...

02:26.500 --> 02:29.600
Why don't you just get it yourself,
Niles? Oh, that's right.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It's bad mugambo
for you to enter.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.400
You know I promised Daphne.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.500
Yes, yes, and woe betide
he who disobeyeth the oracle.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.000
Oh, all right, all right, all right.
Wait, wait.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.600
Maybe if I get it to go
and don't actually sit down,

02:43.900 --> 02:45.300
then I won't be
breaking my promise.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.200
Step aside, everybody.
Big set of onions coming through.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.100
NILES:
Latte to go, please.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.300
Hello, Frasier.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.700
Dr. Tewksbury. Well, uh...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.800
Gosh, this is quite a surprise.
What are you doing here?

03:01.100 --> 03:03.100
I've heard you mention
how good their coffee is here.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.200
- I thought I'd give it a try.
- Oh...

03:05.500 --> 03:07.200
- May I join you?
- Oh, yes, yes, of course.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.800
I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, Roz, uh, meet Dr. Tewksbury.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.800
- This is my producer, Roz Doyle.
ROZ: Hi.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.100
And my brother, Niles.
Niles, Dr. Tewksbury.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.500
- How do you do?
- Hello.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.500
I don't believe we've ever met,

03:17.700 --> 03:20.500
but I seem to recall reading
a fascinating paper of yours recently.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.700
Oh, yes, it was probably
the one about phobias.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.400
Oh, can't sit, can't sit.
Oh... Uh...

03:27.200 --> 03:29.000
Uh...

03:29.300 --> 03:30.900
It's a long story, uh...

03:31.200 --> 03:34.600
Anyway, uh, Dr. Tewksbury,
uh, I was just wondering,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.900
did you read the article
on behaviour modification...?

03:37.200 --> 03:41.900
Now, Frasier, let's not talk shop.
You don't want to bore Roz.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.200
Oh, it's all just white noise
to me now.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.200
Yes, all right.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.900
Niles, please, would you stop hovering
and just sit down, hmm?

03:50.200 --> 03:53.400
Uh, all right. What can it hurt?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.700
- Niles.
- Daphne!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.600
How could you come down here?

03:58.900 --> 04:00.700
- You broke your promise.
- And my patella.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.400
Well, nothing bad
would have happened

04:02.600 --> 04:04.400
if you'd paid attention
to my premonition.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.700
Well, actually, nothing bad would have
happened if you hadn't shown up.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.800
It wouldn't have not happened
had I not shown up.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.200
Wouldn't not have happened
if you hadn't not shown up.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.700
I wouldn't have shown had I not known
you wouldn't be able to not come here.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.500
Well, I'm not... Not... Not... What?

04:18.899 --> 04:20.600
My point exactly. You don't listen.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.400
- Daphne. Oh. Ooh.
- Niles. Niles, you all right?

04:23.800 --> 04:26.200
Oh. No, I've aggravated
my old bossa nova injury.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.200
Well, perhaps I'd better drive you.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.200
- I'm sorry, Dr. Tewksbury.
- I understand.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.900
- Bye, Roz.
- Bye.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.100
Well, heh-heh,
what was that all about?

04:36.500 --> 04:39.900
Well, she thinks she's psychic,
but he doesn't believe her.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.500
Well, no matter
who's right or wrong,

04:42.800 --> 04:46.100
Niles needs to set up
stricter boundaries with his patients.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.300
I learned that
from years of practise.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.200
No. No, she's not his patient.
She's his girlfriend.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.700
Oh, well, in that case,
no matter who's right or wrong,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.600
he's wrong.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.500
I learned that
from years of marriage.

[ROZ CHUCKLES]

05:04.800 --> 05:07.600

How about a cold pack, perhaps?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.000
No, no.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.000
If Daphne ever comes out of her room,
I'll just use her icy stare.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.700
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
have to cancel on the opera tonight.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.800
Oh, Niles, you know
I hate going to the opera alone.

over the seat next to me

05:22.600 --> 05:25.700
and glancing expectantly back
at the ladies' room all night.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.000
- You do that?
- No.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.600
Hey, why don't you ask
Dr. Tewksbury

05:34.900 --> 05:36.100
- if he'd like to go?
- Oh...

05:36.200 --> 05:38.900
Ever since his divorce, I'm sure
he's anxious to get out of the house.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.700
Well, we're in a quasi-therapeutic
relationship right now.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.600
And truth be told, I was uncomfortable
socialising with him at Nervosa.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.300
Oh. Well, I understand.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.200
You don't want to see the wizard
behind the curtain.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.600
Everyone needs an idol,

05:52.900 --> 05:55.900
someone who represents a higher
plateau of truth and knowledge.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.800
That's very insightful, Niles.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.800
For so many years, I must have
represented that plateau to you.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.300
Thank you, Frasier.
Laughter is indeed the best medicine.

is feeling much better.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Oh, good.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.900
Well, I hope she doesn't expect me
to run in there after her.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.300
- Good for you, Niles.
- With this knee, I can only hobble.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.400
Daphne, I'm sorry.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.400
Are you sorry for breaking
your promise or for not believing me?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.500
I'm sorry for breaking my promise.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.100
You don't believe
I had a premonition?

06:31.300 --> 06:33.800
- Well, it wasn't a premonition.
- It certainly was.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.600
I told you if you went to Nervosa
something bad would happen,

06:36.800 --> 06:38.900
and you hurt your knee.
What more proof do you need?

06:39.100 --> 06:41.700
Something a little more scientific
than that, I'm afraid.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.800
You need scientific proof?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, I think
we can do something about that.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.200
What do you mean?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.100
There are people around
who do this sort of research.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.200
Are those people here now?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.400
- No.
- Ow.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.300
I'm talking about
legitimate professionals.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.900
Well, uh...

07:01.200 --> 07:04.400
All right. All right.
But it has to be a real scientist.

07:04.700 --> 07:08.200
Not some huckster who comes here
with crystals and a ghost-o-meter.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.800
As long as you have an open mind.
And it's pronounced ghostometers.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.400
- I'm glad we worked this out.
- Me too.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.000
And now that we've made up,
maybe we could, mm...

07:23.300 --> 07:27.600
Mm... Well, I guess we know
who's not psychic.

- You forgot, didn't you?
- No.

What are you doing here?

07:55.600 --> 07:59.200
Oh, just, uh, wearing clothes.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.900
Oh, right. Ha-ha.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.900
Frasier brought over some work
from the office.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.800
Ah. I'll just go get dressed.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.800
I've gone blind.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.300
And ten seconds too late. Ha-ha.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.200
So since when have you
and Dr. Tewksbury

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
been seeing each other?

08:18.700 --> 08:22.400
Well, um, the other day at Nervosa,
we really hit it off after you left,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.200
and, uh, he asked me to dinner.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.400
And we've been out
every night since.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.500
Really? Well, I must say,
I'm a bit surprised.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
Why? He's smart.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.799
Very insightful.
And he's such a great listener.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.299
Yes, well, I'm happy for you, Roz.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.000
It's just a little difficult
imagining the two of you together.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.900
You don't think I can appreciate
a sophisticated man?

08:44.300 --> 08:47.500
You know, it's not
just about sex for me, Frasier.

08:47.700 --> 08:52.600
Uh, do you have a stepladder?
My pants are stuck in the ceiling fan.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.300
Frasier, listen, before we begin,

09:00.600 --> 09:04.600
I hope it wasn't too awkward
seeing me with Roz last night.

09:05.100 --> 09:10.700
Not at all. It's just a little... jarring
to see you out of context that way.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.200
- Yeah.
- It's just...

09:12.500 --> 09:14.200
But your personal life
is your business.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.800
Speaking of which,
let's get down to business.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.800
- The Crane mind.
- Yes, let us.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.700
Now, last time
we had just broached the subject

09:24.300 --> 09:29.300
of your father's expectations and
their effect on your early adulthood.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.700
As we know, ahem,
the internalisation

09:34.400 --> 09:36.200
of a parent's moral code

09:36.500 --> 09:39.100
is crucial to the development
of the superego.

09:39.300 --> 09:42.900
And considering
your father's strictness...

09:44.100 --> 09:45.500
Frasier, is everything all right?

09:46.500 --> 09:49.400
Yes, yes, of course.
Of course. Please, continue.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.100
You must admit
that having a father

09:51.400 --> 09:55.000
whose very occupation
is the enforcement of the moral code

09:55.400 --> 09:58.800
would lead
to an overdeveloped superego.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.800
I believe I have a paper
on this subject.

on anything he was saying.

Wasn't he talking about you?

10:58.300 --> 11:02.500
Yes, yes, but recently,
I saw him in...

11:03.200 --> 11:07.200
Well, a less than dignified light.

11:07.400 --> 11:12.100
And, uh, ever since, I've just found it
impossible to take him seriously.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.700
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.700
In Korea, I had this commanding
officer, Lieutenant Franks.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.200
I would have followed that guy
into the gates of hell.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.500
I saw him a few years later.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.500
He was flipping hamburgers
in a fast-food place.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.200
Now, that was hard to handle.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.000
I mean, this guy took me
under his wing and moulded me.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.500
- Like a mentor.
- Yeah, exactly.

11:35.700 --> 11:39.600
He always used to say that one day
he'd be taking orders from me.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.900
Just never thought
it would be for extra onions.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.100
So how did you handle it?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.200
Well, I just realised
that it was my problem, not his.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.800
And I wasn't going to let that erase
all he meant to me.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.900
So I just marched right back
into that kitchen and saluted him.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.600
And after we were talking for a while,
I realised nothing had changed.

11:58.900 --> 12:02.100
He was still the same
hard-charging man's man

12:02.400 --> 12:05.100
who wasn't afraid
to get his hands dirty.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.700
Which is why
I never ate there again.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.300
Uh, if you two don't mind,

12:11.500 --> 12:13.300
Daphne's psychic evaluator
is on the way over,

12:13.400 --> 12:14.900

Fine with me.
That stuff creeps me out anyway.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.100
Niles, I still can't believe
you ever agreed to this.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.200
Those tests
are based on nothing more

12:22.400 --> 12:25.100
than subjective evidence
and lucky guesses.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.500
Yes, not at all
like the subjective evidence

- Aha.

- Heh-heh.

Actually, I'm a professor of psychiatry
at Seattle University.

- Mm.

- So, hmm, you're more of a debunker.

Well, no, not at all.
Actually, I apply scientific method

13:12.700 --> 13:14.600
to the search
for paranormal phenomena.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.500
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier

13:16.700 --> 13:18.500
than discovering
a legitimate psychic.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
Oh, so you've never found one.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.200
Well, if by psychic you mean
people with above normal prescience,

then a few.

If you mean somebody who can
beat the house in Vegas, then no.

That's it.
That was your final test.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.200
And I'm psychic, right?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.900
First we have to compare
your results

14:17.100 --> 14:18.700
to those of the rest
of the control group.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.900
It'll just take me a few minutes here
to run these numbers, okay?

14:22.500 --> 14:25.100
So... how do you think you did?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.300
I think I did pretty well
on the cards.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.700
The premonition test was a little tricky,
but all in all, I was in the zone.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.900
Well, we'll soon find out.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.200
You know, Daphne,
I'm always curious.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.200
When was it that you first suspected
you had psychic ability?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.900
Oh, years ago
when I was a little girl.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.400
Grammy Moon
first saw the gift in me.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.900
See, I was a girl in a house
full of boys, which I hated.

14:48.300 --> 14:52.100
Until Grammy told me that
only Moon women had second sight.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.000
She had it, her mother had it,
and so on.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.000
After that, I began noticing I could
sense things before they happened.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.300
Sort of like a secret power.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.700
Anyway, it's always just been
a part of who I am.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.900
I see. Well, we have your results.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.700
All right. I don't know why,
I'm a bit nervous.

- So, Daphne, from what I see here...
- Wait. Uh, wait.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.900
I don't think we should do this.
I don't wanna know.

DAPHNE: What do you mean?
- I'm sorry. I think this was a bad idea.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.900
Well, I thought you wanted
scientific proof.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.700
I changed my mind.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.200
I don't need a stranger
telling me anything about who you are.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.900
I want us to get to know each other
on our own, over time.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.100
I knew you were gonna say that.

15:44.600 --> 15:49.900
- You did?
- No. But I loved hearing it.

we've wasted your time.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.600
It's okay.

TEWKSBURY: All right, Frasier,
let's start with our last session.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.800
As I recall,
you were having difficulty

16:18.100 --> 16:20.200
getting rid of a certain image
in your mind.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.700
- That is correct.
- Mm-hm.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.700
Well, perhaps
we should confront that.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.400
Oh, dear Lord.
I assumed that was Roz's.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.500
It is.
I was at her apartment this morning.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.800
I started thinking
about your issue with the robe,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.500
and I decided to bring it with me.

16:36.900 --> 16:41.800
Now, Frasier, ahem, you consider me
a competent psychiatrist, don't you?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.600
Of course I do.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.000
Does seeing me dressed like this
diminish that?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.300
No. Of course not.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.100
It's just, well,
I know on a conscious level,

16:50.400 --> 16:53.300
that the garment
does not change who you are.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.900
But on an unconscious level,
I'm all weirded out.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.800
I mean, you're my mentor
and you're wearing Roz's robe.

17:01.100 --> 17:06.099
- I'm still the same person.
- Yes, but it's Roz's robe.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.599
And what does Roz's robe
signify to you?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.300
- Roz.
- Well...

17:12.599 --> 17:14.700
Then maybe this isn't
about you and me.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.800
Maybe this is about
your relationship with Roz.

17:19.099 --> 17:22.500
Seeing me dressed like this
brings up deep feelings.

17:22.900 --> 17:27.900
Don't be afraid of those feelings.

the toppling of a hero.

that it's really about you.

enough for your precious mentor.

what attracted you to Dr. Tewksbury,
