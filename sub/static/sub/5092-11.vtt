WEBVTT

00:13.214 --> 00:15.216
MAN:
Just to be clear,

00:15.249 --> 00:16.784
these are chickens
you've brought me, right?

00:16.817 --> 00:19.320
You're not selling
exotic birds now?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.488
What do mean, exotic?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.223
They're from Hempstead.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.725
These prices-- I'm expecting
maybe a box of talking parrots.

00:24.758 --> 00:28.296
These birds are done talking,
Connie, and so are we.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.763
That's the best
price in town.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.666
Oh, yeah? Bayhurst is
beating you by 50 cents a pound.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.368
Yeah, and the pigeons
in Central Park are free,

00:34.402 --> 00:36.570
but that don't make
them a good deal.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.606
(laughs)

00:38.639 --> 00:41.475
Okay, okay, point taken.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.577
Talking parrots.
You almost had me there.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.579
Uh, I get you next time.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.747
Yeah, yeah.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.416
Take it easy, Connie.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.451
Thanks, Ralph.
See you next week.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.485
Hmm.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.322
(entrance bell tinkles)

00:54.355 --> 00:57.225
Hey, babe. What's doing?

00:57.258 --> 00:58.792
For dinner?

00:58.826 --> 01:00.728
I don't know.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.430
It's 6:00 in the morning.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.432
(grunts)

01:04.465 --> 01:06.367
Sure. Whatever.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.402
Anything but chicken.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.306
Hang on. I got a customer.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.443
¿Hey, Pablo, cómo estás?

01:15.476 --> 01:18.312
You need it now?
6:00 in the morning.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.415
Okay, yeah,
let me see what I got.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.218
(sniffles)

01:29.590 --> 01:31.592
(entrance bell tinkles)

01:33.594 --> 01:36.197
Uncle Connie?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.434
Connie, you in back?

01:40.468 --> 01:41.869
CONNIE:
That you, Mike?

01:41.902 --> 01:44.104
Mm-hmm.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.341
Put it on my tab.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.476
What tab? Come here.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.644
Oh... (speaking Greek)

01:50.678 --> 01:52.280
Is the grill on?

01:52.313 --> 01:53.681
I want to make
some eggs.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.383
No, not now.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.451
What? I just got off tour.
I'm starving.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.586
Mike, I'm with
the accountant.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.688
I-I haven't opened
up quite yet.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.357
Why not come back a
little later, okay?

02:03.391 --> 02:06.627
No worries. I'll fire up
the grill myself.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.562
Mike!

02:08.596 --> 02:10.531
You got to go.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.533
Connie, what is going on
with you?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.935
Nothing. I just can't let

02:14.968 --> 02:17.238
the accountant
keep sitting back there.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.439
So go.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.640
MAN:
You heard him.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.675
He's not open.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.749
What the hell's going on here?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.288
I know that look.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.423
You busted?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.491
I'm not flush.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.493
Join the club.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.796
I haven't been flush since
the Giants won the Super Bowl.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.865
Not that I recommend gambling

02:44.898 --> 02:46.534
as an alternate source
of income.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.203
I guess I could get
a cheaper apartment.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.604
Or you could get a second job.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.441
Doing what we
do every day

02:53.474 --> 02:56.444
and not having two nickels
to rub together at night--

02:56.477 --> 02:57.778
it's just wrong.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.847
You got that little
painting crew, right?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.649
What?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.518
You want to work for me?

03:04.552 --> 03:07.455
'Cause I don't see enough
of your mug as it is?

03:07.488 --> 03:10.458
Why not? I know how to paint.
I'm even good at it.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.725
All right, fine.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.295
You're lucky
I got some work coming up.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.330
Great. When do we start?

03:16.364 --> 03:18.299
End of tour,
if you can handle it.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.667
Absolutely.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.635
You know,
you really are lucky?

03:21.669 --> 03:24.905
Summer of my first year,
I spent my off hours

03:24.938 --> 03:27.541
shoveling elephant dung
for the circus.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.742
No kidding.
Oh, yeah.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.444
It's a rough trade,

03:30.478 --> 03:32.746
but I did get to have sex
with a lady clown.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.782
Oh.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.587
Okay, I got the breaded
breast filets

03:39.620 --> 03:41.555
and the marinated
drumstick combos.

03:41.589 --> 03:45.626
No, no, I'm not going back
to the shop for three capons.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.596
Look, if you want
what I got, I...

03:48.629 --> 03:51.665
(angry shouting in diner)
All right, I'll be there in...

03:51.699 --> 03:54.602
Let me call you back.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.636
(gunshots)

03:57.371 --> 03:58.839
(more gunshots)

03:58.872 --> 04:01.342
DISPATCHER:
911. What's your emergency?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.511
Yeah. I need
to report a shooting.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.712
What's your location, sir?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.747
I'm at the Airline Diner. Hurry!

04:17.491 --> 04:19.760
The mayor wants a new recruiting
campaign for the department.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.395
He's looking for a
multi-platformed,

04:21.429 --> 04:22.530
demographically targeted
approach

04:22.563 --> 04:25.799
that can easily knit with
the social networking spaces.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.034
Those were his words?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.302
In his memo, yes.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.871
He's quite fluent in emerging
communication streams, actually.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.640
What ever happened
to plain English?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.508
Good morning, Baker.
Morning.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.909
It evolved,
like everything else.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.412
Well, almost everything.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.314
Today's schedule.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.882
I see your first meeting
is underway.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.584
I was accosted in the elevator.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.686
BAKER:
Very good, sir.
We're already

04:45.719 --> 04:46.954
hitting our recruiting targets.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.656
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.724
We're barely hitting it, and
the mayor's research suggests

04:50.758 --> 04:51.925
that we're losing candidates

04:51.959 --> 04:54.628
to higher pay and benefits in
the suburbs, or a lower cost

04:54.662 --> 04:56.964
of living and better perks
in the sunnier climates.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.332
What else is feeding this?

04:58.366 --> 04:59.700
He drilled down on
the ticket-fixing

04:59.733 --> 05:01.635
incidents
in the Bronx precincts.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.003
Most of the cops involved

05:03.036 --> 05:05.005
had less than seven years
on the job,

05:05.038 --> 05:07.375
which goes to the
other question.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.543
Are we recruiting the best
and the brightest?

05:09.577 --> 05:10.511
I know a police officer

05:10.544 --> 05:12.680
who used to be a lawyer
and went to Harvard.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.048
You also know
that you can't fight city hall.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.618
I got a guy in charge
of recruitment.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.020
The mayor requested
that you meet with his guy.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.389
The mayor's got a guy?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.690
He ran all the media

05:22.723 --> 05:24.625
for his election campaign--
Kevin Schmidt.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.727
And how's his plain English?
You'll find out

05:26.760 --> 05:27.895
at lunch. Can I confirm?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.062
Do I have a choice?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.698
1:00 at Malvino's.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.733
At least we'll eat well.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.703
(sighs)

05:35.736 --> 05:37.938
(garbled radio transmission)

05:37.971 --> 05:40.674
Detectives,
we got a situation.
Hey. Yeah.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.842
Where's our guy?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.010
Which guy you
talking about?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.077
Which do
you think?
Come on.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.414
The call came over
as an officer-involved shooting.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.582
Right? This is the right
crime scene, isn't it?

05:48.616 --> 05:50.150
Yeah, but there's a problem.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.151
Is that the guy?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.953
No, it's not.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.688
JACKIE:
So, what's the problem?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.424
Is there an officer
down somewhere?

05:56.457 --> 05:59.059
No. Well,
we don't actually know.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.462
Look, are you huffing glue
or something?

06:01.495 --> 06:03.431
We got a call
of a 10-13.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.732
Where's the police officer?

06:04.765 --> 06:05.766
That's what we don't know,

06:05.799 --> 06:07.000
I'm trying to tell you.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.669
All we got is this guy.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.504
Witness says the owner
was working the counter

06:10.538 --> 06:12.139
when it went down,
and he's gone, too.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.775
Okay. So, there was a cop here,
and now there's not.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.643
So, what was the 10-13 about?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.177
Somebody trying
to screw around with us?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.879
Talk to him, okay?

06:18.912 --> 06:20.814
He called 911.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.751
Says he saw a cop walk in
right before the shooting.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.786
Then he saw the cop walk out.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.821
So, it's a cop that fled
the scene of the crime?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.024
Fantastic. Thank you.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.815
Makes you wonder.
I'm talking to Connie

06:54.848 --> 06:57.751
five more minutes,
that could have been me.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.020
Connie? You talking about
the owner of the diner?

07:00.053 --> 07:02.189
Constantine Markos.
All right, this
Constantine Markos--

07:02.222 --> 07:04.992
it's not the guy that's lying
dead on the floor in there?

07:05.025 --> 07:06.226
I know that now, but I thought

07:06.259 --> 07:07.695
Connie was the only one
in there.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.463
You didn't see anyone
else in the diner?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.099
Well, the guy who got shot--
he must have come in the front

07:12.132 --> 07:13.734
right when I was
walking out the back.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.903
The only person I saw going
in there was that cop.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.137
All right, what
happened next?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.672
Well, he goes in,

07:18.706 --> 07:20.741
I'm checking inventory
in the back of my truck,

07:20.774 --> 07:22.810
then the shooting starts,
and I dive for cover,

07:22.843 --> 07:24.244
and the next thing I see is

07:24.277 --> 07:26.013
the cop high-tailing it
up the block.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.048
Hold on. You seen the cop
running up the block?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.718
Well, not like-like sprinting,
but-but walking fast.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.720
Well, was he walking fast,
or was he high-tailing it?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.555
You sound a little
confused. Maybe he wasn't

07:34.588 --> 07:36.490
even a cop. Maybe it was
some other uniform,

07:36.524 --> 07:37.991
and you just didn't quite
get it straight.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.159
I know what a cop looks like,
okay?

07:39.192 --> 07:40.160
JACKIE: All right,
all right.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.529
It's just, a cop fleeing

07:41.562 --> 07:42.696
the scene of the crime?

07:42.730 --> 07:43.964
It doesn't make any sense.

07:43.997 --> 07:44.898
Yeah, unless he did the crime.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.900
Hey, I read the paper.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.536
Not every cop's
a saint, you know.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.571
Right. Okay, you get
a good look at him?

07:50.604 --> 07:52.573
Well, enough to know
that he was a cop.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.274
He's a white guy,
pretty tall,

07:54.307 --> 07:56.276
dark hair.
Okay, what happened
to Constantine Markos?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.911
Where'd he go?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.648
Well, I guess he went out
the back, but I don't know.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.015
(phone ringing)
Oh.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.250
You mind if I get this?

08:03.283 --> 08:04.785
My wife--
she's going nuts.
Go ahead.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.019
Go.
All right.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.287
Don't go too far.
Listen to this.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.990
Local precincts report no foot
patrols assigned in the area.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.725
Nobody's
missing anybody.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.761
Who is this cop?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.801
(entrance bell tinkles)

08:20.834 --> 08:22.235
MAN:
Detective Curatola,

08:22.269 --> 08:24.304
I was hoping our next meeting
would be over dinner.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.040
Yeah, only if there's
a dead body under the table.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.308
Well, can't blame me for trying.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.210
What do we got?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.344
No ID on this guy.
Caught a slug

08:31.378 --> 08:35.248
in the neck and one in the arm.
Looks like he bled out.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.750
It's a messy shooting.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.152
Yup, this guy's packing
some serious heat.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.621
Which he used to put two rounds

08:40.654 --> 08:43.256
in the wall behind you,
about a foot apart.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.325
Huh. Okay, so,
this guy is shooting here.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.760
Cop comes in,
shooting there,

08:46.794 --> 08:47.961
but they came
in separately.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.230
Maybe our cop happened
upon a hit.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.833
Well, the register's empty, so
maybe it's a stickup gone bad.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.334
Well, doesn't explain
why the cop would run.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.036
I mean, we are allowed
to shoot bad guys.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.971
Especially if
they shoot at us.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.140
Maybe our cop was
the stickup guy.
Possible.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.142
So, let's see. A guy
gets dressed up as a cop,

09:02.175 --> 09:04.044
comes in to rob a diner, and
then there just happens

09:04.077 --> 09:05.746
to be a guy sitting here
with a nickel-plated .45?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.180
I don't know.
I said maybe.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.082
It didn't have
to be a customer, though.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.685
Maybe the two of them showed up
to rob the place.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.587
Bam, ran into each other.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.758
Trouble here is,

09:17.791 --> 09:18.926
none of this explains why

09:18.959 --> 09:20.761
the owner of the diner
is in the wind.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.630
Can we get an address
on this Connie character?

09:22.663 --> 09:23.931
Yeah.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.703
What the hell is this?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.271
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.240
What are you guys doing?
Who are you?

09:33.273 --> 09:34.374
Detectives Reagan
and Curatola.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.609
We're investigating a homicide.

09:35.643 --> 09:36.977
Not in there.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.146
We got the job
as a burglary
in progress.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.681
Alarm went off
20 minutes ago,

09:40.714 --> 09:42.382
and the company notified
communications.
All right.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.619
Looks like your case might be
mixed up in our case. Uh...

09:45.653 --> 09:47.287
You two knock on
some doors for us?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.656
See if we've got
any witnesses?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.390
Sure. We'll start
down there.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.259
Great.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.294
(door opening)

09:56.296 --> 09:59.132
Wow. So much for a diner
stickup gone bad, huh?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.300
Yeah.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.002
Looks like somebody
wanted a lot more

10:02.035 --> 10:03.637
than the cash in
Connie's register.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.305
Yeah, and if our dead guy
is dead,

10:05.338 --> 10:07.641
and this just happened,
is it our cop?
Yeah.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.109
Or maybe there
was a third guy.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.978
I mean, somebody tossed
this place pretty good.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.046
But what the heck would
Connie, the diner guy, have

10:13.080 --> 10:15.048
that somebody
would want so bad?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.317
Uh, I'm saying
a secret moussaka recipe.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.754
What?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.422
"Connie, thanks for
being there for me."

10:22.455 --> 10:25.158
Seven-pointed shield--
that's Auxiliary Police.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.927
So our cop isn't
even a cop?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.428
Apparently not.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.297
Isn't Auxiliary
supposed to observe

10:30.330 --> 10:31.665
and report?
Right.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.701
Where did he get a gun?
I have no idea,

10:33.734 --> 10:35.002
but we usually give
courtesy shields out

10:35.035 --> 10:36.336
to friends and family,
right?
Mm-hmm.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.171
So maybe Connie and this guy
were related somehow.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.340
Maybe Connie and this guy
are in business together,

10:40.373 --> 10:42.209
and it went south.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.945
Yeah, south,
and then straight to hell.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.284
Man. Oh, damn it.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.721
Thought you said you knew
what you were doing.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.722
(sighs)

10:54.755 --> 10:56.924
Hey.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.792
You should get
some real painting clothes.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.260
Yeah, I'll run
by my Dad's place.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.830
There's got to be something
in the garage I can grab.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.364
Take a meal
anytime soon, Sarge?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.067
Yeah, soon as
we finish this section.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.368
Can I ask you something?

11:08.401 --> 11:09.870
Shoot.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.004
Smart kid like you,

11:11.038 --> 11:13.774
no family to support,
no car payments.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.243
So?

11:16.276 --> 11:18.478
So, how come you can't
make ends meet on your salary?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.480
Law degree loan.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.815
Big nut?

11:21.849 --> 11:24.384
Big nut.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.286
Go ahead, say it.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.454
Do I really have to?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.189
If I'm so smart,

11:29.222 --> 11:30.390
how come I'm painting fences

11:30.423 --> 11:32.492
to help pay off
a Harvard law degree?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.961
All ass-backwards, right?

11:33.994 --> 11:35.896
That's not what I was gonna say.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.264
No?

11:37.297 --> 11:38.766
What I was gonna say is,
you're still getting

11:38.799 --> 11:39.967
too much paint on your brush.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.104
That's why you got
all the drips and the glops.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.440
Point taken, Frank,
but I'd say that's just the view

11:47.474 --> 11:49.109
from the top of the wave.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.410
Tops of the wave?

11:50.443 --> 11:53.213
A summary
of the metrics.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.214
And?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.216
Well, put it this way.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.786
Yes, you have a big number
of applicants taking the exam.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.321
But this sea bass here,
if he could use a pen,

12:01.354 --> 12:03.490
could take the exam, too.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.225
You're selling
a government job

12:05.258 --> 12:06.526
with benefits and a pension.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.096
So is your competition--
the Armed Forces,

12:09.129 --> 12:12.766
the other uniformed services
in this and every other city.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.501
And this isn't every other city.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.769
It's more expensive
to live in,

12:15.803 --> 12:17.204
taxes are high,
winters are harsh.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.806
But there are ways
to counter that,

12:18.839 --> 12:20.007
which is the
challenge here.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.776
You and I can say,
hey, it's the Big Apple,

12:22.810 --> 12:25.545
but our target demo is
shopping it against Albuquerque

12:25.578 --> 12:28.481
or Mineola like it's apples
to apples-- pun intended.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.819
And in that comparison,
the NYPD is coming up short.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.753
I would disagree.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.790
Let me walk you through.

12:36.824 --> 12:37.925
The call to duty.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.828
It's the same call our Armed
Forces recruiters have been

12:40.861 --> 12:43.063
implementing with so much
success these past ten years:

12:43.096 --> 12:44.564
to fight the war on terrorism.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.533
Kevin, could we pause
for a moment?

12:46.566 --> 12:47.801
What's the first
image that pops

12:47.835 --> 12:49.469
into people's heads
when we talk about

12:49.502 --> 12:51.404
the modern call to duty?
Stop right there.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.572
What?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.308
If I'm about to see images

12:55.342 --> 12:59.179
of the Twin Towers coming down,
turn that thing off.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.249
Listen, I can appreciate
your concern, Frank, but...

13:02.282 --> 13:03.984
It's more than concern.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.154
The event itself
and the continuing threat--

13:07.187 --> 13:08.989
they're your biggest asset.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.892
Are you finished?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.463
I will not use 9/11
to sell my department.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.941
JACKIE:
I don't know how many more

13:27.975 --> 13:29.609
of these Auxiliary cops
I can talk to.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.611
DANNY:
Ten more precincts
to go, partner.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.846
Almost done.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.081
Officers!

13:34.114 --> 13:36.016
We were wondering
if you could help us out,

13:36.049 --> 13:37.517
if you had a second to spare.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.519
You guys couldn't find a
rookie to do your coffee runs?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.188
Excuse me?

13:41.221 --> 13:42.455
Maybe they want
some muffins, too.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.390
Hey, forthwith.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.624
Actually, we're
investigating a murder,

13:44.657 --> 13:45.658
not playing Keystone Kops.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.561
(sighs) There was a shooting
at the Airline Diner.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.063
You know about this?

13:50.097 --> 13:52.532
Yeah, we just...

13:52.565 --> 13:54.201
You just thought you'd
act like a schmuck

13:54.234 --> 13:55.468
in front of a
couple detectives.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.470
Is that it?
What can we do for you?

13:57.504 --> 14:00.240
Uh, we're looking for the guy
who owns the diner,

14:00.273 --> 14:02.142
a Constantine Markos.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.878
We think he has a friend or
family member with Auxiliary.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.446
That's a Greek name, right?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.448
Oh, you thinking Jimmy
the Greek or Greek Mike?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.450
Greek Mike. Jimmy's been
in Pittsburgh for two weeks.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.552
Did you say the shooter
was an Auxiliary?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.287
No, actually we
didn't say that.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.056
Well, but that's what
you're thinking, right?

14:16.089 --> 14:18.525
'Cause, uh, Greek Mike's
kind of a squared away guy.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.561
This Greek Mike--
he's taller, dark hair, younger.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.996
Damn.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.197
That is Greek Mike.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.099
Do you guys all have
goofy nicknames?

14:26.133 --> 14:28.568
Clothesline Larry.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.403
I clotheslined a
purse snatcher once.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.671
He made the papers.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.673
Oh.
Oh, that's good.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.909
Mike's last name is Galatis.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.210
You really think
he's your shooter?

14:37.244 --> 14:39.679
We'll find out when
we speak to him.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.582
Thank you.
Thanks for your
time, Officers.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.487
Down the hall.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.588
All right.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.557
You guys know
he's a cop, right?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.592
Yeah. A rent-a-cop.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.427
See, that's the very problem
with these guys.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.695
People think
they're dealing with

14:55.728 --> 14:58.698
the real cops, when a cantaloupe
could pass the Auxiliary test.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.633
And you get guys
like Clothesline Larry.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.702
But he did get
a bad guy though.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.304
Yeah, well, you know,
even a blind squirrel

15:04.337 --> 15:05.538
finds an acorn
once in a while.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.640
(knocking)

15:07.674 --> 15:10.577
Mike Galatis!

15:10.610 --> 15:11.979
(pounding)

15:12.012 --> 15:13.280
Police! Open up!

15:13.313 --> 15:14.581
MIKE:
It's open!

15:23.991 --> 15:25.625
Mike?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.660
I'm back here.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.965
All right.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.306
Everything
okay in there?

15:39.339 --> 15:40.473
MIKE:
I'm unarmed.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.409
The gun's on the desk.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.646
Let me see your hands.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.747
You find Connie?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.717
I said, put your hands
where I can see them, right now.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.952
On your feet
and turn around.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.730
You really like the NYPD, huh?

16:03.763 --> 16:04.531
Yeah.
(handcuffs clicking)

16:04.564 --> 16:06.733
Got a funny way of
showing it, kid.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.668
I know that I should've
come in right away.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.703
You can lament about
that in the car.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.440
You have one of these
pictures on your wall?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.580
Let's go, fan boy.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.601
(door opens)

16:50.843 --> 16:53.380
Want me to turn the heat up?

16:55.182 --> 16:56.349
You still got your coat on.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.385
Well...

17:00.720 --> 17:03.156
What's got
you, Francis?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.458
Mayor's ordered
a new marketing campaign.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.261
He's convinced that
the department's losing

17:08.295 --> 17:10.497
the best and brightest
to other cities.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.332
What do they got that we don't?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.467
To hear them tell it,
better weather,

17:14.501 --> 17:16.736
better quality of life,
more money, you name it.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.739
So, what's his fix?

17:19.772 --> 17:23.276
They want to use 9/11
as a sales pitch.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.278
Oh, for...

17:25.312 --> 17:27.547
That's what I said.

17:27.580 --> 17:32.519
The department's roots
go back to 1625, not 2001.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.221
Come on, please.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.488
Your grandfather

17:35.522 --> 17:38.525
still had Donegal potatoes in
his pockets when he joined up.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.160
(chuckles)

17:40.193 --> 17:41.361
Why'd you join up?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.696
Mick cops make cops.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.599
(both laugh)

17:46.633 --> 17:49.302
No, the only member
of this family

17:49.336 --> 17:51.604
who actually made a choice
was Jamie.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.809
And I think he's a little cranky
about it these days.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.645
Why is that?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.281
He came by today
to borrow some overalls.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.384
He's painting houses

18:04.417 --> 18:07.254
with Renzulli
on his days off

18:07.287 --> 18:08.355
to make his nut.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.391
(sighs)

18:17.430 --> 18:20.433
(people chattering,
phone ringing nearby)

18:25.738 --> 18:29.342
Okay, so prints came back
on our dead guy, Billy Jackson.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.911
Uh, small-time hood,
nothing too crazy.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.281
So, what about this guy?
Michael Galatis.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.415
You know, this kid
applied for the cops

18:35.448 --> 18:36.583
as soon as he was of age?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.385
What happened?
Was rejected.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.552
He failed
the character investigation.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.720
Why? What did he do?

18:40.753 --> 18:41.888
Two juvie arrests.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.256
He was acquitted of assault.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.157
He was convicted
of petty larceny.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.459
He stole a six-pack
of beer from a bodega.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.362
Sounds like you.
Come on, I did
a lot worse than that.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.163
This kid was unlucky.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.498
If he had
a different investigator,

18:51.531 --> 18:52.865
he would have been a cop.
Oh.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.334
I figure that to be a catch.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.635
Look at his emergency contact.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.937
Constantine Markos.
His uncle.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.207
Thanks.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.875
Oh. And then there's this.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.513
What the hell is going on
with this case?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.548
I don't know.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.425
MIKE: Did you guys
find Connie?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.927
Your mean your Uncle Connie?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.462
We'll get to him in a minute.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.463
Look, I'm gonna

19:23.496 --> 19:25.498
cooperate, but Connie's
the only family I got.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.500
You have to tell me
if he's okay.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.802
Well, he's definitely
well enough to run.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.471
He was scared.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.605
Those guys were gonna kill him.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.474
DANNY:
Hold on. What
do you mean,

19:34.507 --> 19:35.542
those guys?

19:35.575 --> 19:37.210
We only know about one guy.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.346
This guy.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.315
That's Billy.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.750
The other guy's name was Joey.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.419
I don't know
their last names, but

19:46.453 --> 19:48.421
Joey was definitely
the one who was in charge.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.756
In charge of what, Mike?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.524
(mutters, sighs)

19:51.558 --> 19:52.492
You could just tell, you know?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.995
Come on. You shoot Billy...
with this gun?

19:56.028 --> 19:59.566
Yeah, but it was
in self-defense.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.268
Where'd you get the gun?

20:01.301 --> 20:02.935
Connie kept it
behind the counter.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.704
I didn't bring it with me.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.440
The second I walked in,
Billy pulled his piece,

20:07.474 --> 20:09.642
he told me to sit
down and shut up.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.311
But Joey was smacking

20:11.344 --> 20:13.380
Connie around, and he shoved
the gun in his face.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.682
I mean, when I went for that
gun, Billy was already shooting.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.550
That's self-defense, isn't it?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.552
(knocking)

20:19.586 --> 20:21.288
Detective Reagan?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.489
Yeah.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.357
Your family's here.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.393
All right.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.429
I'll be back.
JACKIE: Okay.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.665
Hey!

20:32.699 --> 20:33.933
Oh, hey, Dad.
Hi, Dad.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.735
Hey.
(laughing):
What are you doing here?

20:35.768 --> 20:38.471
Yeah, well, we're on our way to
Cousin Anthony's birthday party

20:38.505 --> 20:40.607
at the Hard Rock, so we thought
we'd stop by.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.575
Good.
We just got
these in.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.911
You guys are the
first to have 'em.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.313
Whoa.
Whoa!

20:46.346 --> 20:47.480
(laughing)
What do you say?

20:47.514 --> 20:48.448
Thank you!
Thank you!

20:48.481 --> 20:50.016
You're very
welcome.
Thanks.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.419
Come here, you. Let's
put that on. Ooh!

20:52.452 --> 20:54.921
Dad?
I'm about to make you
an official police officer.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.556
Yes?
Is he a dirty cop?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.624
Is who a dirty cop?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.792
The one
you're sweating in the box.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.361
"Sweating in
the box?"

21:01.394 --> 21:03.396
He did not learn
that language from me.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.365
Sean, have you been playing
those video games again?

21:05.398 --> 21:06.566
No.
What? I saw
him. He did.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.369
Uh-uh-uh, don't you snitch,
and you-- don't fib to your mom.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.537
Get over there.
Where, at Tommy's?

21:10.570 --> 21:11.538
Yeah.
Let me see that.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.340
I swear, there's no
supervision over there.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.607
Yeah.
LINDA:
Come here.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.075
Come here, right here.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.910
Dad?
Yeah?

21:17.944 --> 21:20.880
Is he a dirty cop?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.715
No, he's an Auxiliary cop, son.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.717
He's involved in a shooting
I'm investigating.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.519
But he's a bad guy, right?

21:26.553 --> 21:28.555
No, he's not a bad guy.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.558
He's... he's lost,
and, um, he's in a bit of a jam,

21:31.591 --> 21:34.060
and I'm trying to help him
find his way out.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.928
Mm.
Which I have
to get back to.

21:35.962 --> 21:36.896
Okay, Detective?

21:36.929 --> 21:38.798
You tell your Cousin Anthony,
happy birthday.

21:38.831 --> 21:39.966
Bye, Dad.
I'll see you later.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.601
All right, I will.
See you, Dad.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.770
You know how to read a
ballistics report, right?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.905
Explain that.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.073
(door opens)

21:47.106 --> 21:48.508
This doesn't make any sense.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.642
No, but there it is.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.579
The gun you used on Billy
and the gun he used on you

21:52.612 --> 21:54.414
came in the same batch
of stolen weapons.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.883
Is that a coincidence?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.751
You bring that gun
with you, Mike?

21:58.785 --> 22:01.721
No. I told you...

22:01.754 --> 22:04.457
Come on, you know how this
looks to us, Mike, don't you?

22:04.491 --> 22:05.658
I don't care.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.694
I've known Connie my whole life.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.095
He got that gun for protection.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.563
That's it.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.535
All right, did you know that
Connie's house was tossed?

22:15.568 --> 22:16.536
No?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.671
What are they looking for, Mike?

22:18.705 --> 22:20.607
I mean, your uncle
still has a VCR,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.675
so it's not valuables, right?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.411
Where else would your
uncle hide something?

22:24.444 --> 22:25.712
He wouldn't.
Come on!

22:25.745 --> 22:27.680
Give us a for-instance.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.650
You want us to believe you,
then prove us wrong, all right?

22:30.683 --> 22:33.586
Tell us where your Uncle Connie
would hide something.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.822
Tell us!

22:35.855 --> 22:38.391
He's got a storage locker.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.527
It's just a bunch of
stuff for the diner.

22:40.560 --> 22:44.030
I could take you there,
you wouldn't even

22:44.063 --> 22:45.932
need a warrant;
Connie gave me a key.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.800
Good.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.636
Take us there.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.806
DANNY:
Which way?

22:53.840 --> 22:56.409
MIKE:
Right.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.810
JACKIE:
You believe this guy's story?

22:57.844 --> 23:00.513
DANNY:
Well, he only knows what his
Uncle Connie told him, right?

23:00.547 --> 23:02.815
MIKE:
Did you at least put out
a Finest Message on Joey?

23:02.849 --> 23:05.452
What's supposed to say, "Wanted
for questioning, some white guy

23:05.485 --> 23:07.587
that Mike Galatis didn't shoot
in his uncle's restaurant"?

23:07.620 --> 23:08.988
This one.
This one?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.490
Yeah.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.869
MIKE:
See? I told you.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.904
I don't see anything yet.

23:24.937 --> 23:27.006
But let's take a look.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.541
(pans clattering)

23:28.575 --> 23:29.676
Let's see.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.778
Well.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.648
What do we have here?

23:38.651 --> 23:41.621
You say your uncle got that
gun for protection, huh?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.022
What was he expecting? An army?

23:55.935 --> 23:59.171
FRANK:
You didn't hear this from me,
but your undercover work

23:59.205 --> 24:02.542
with the Sanfinos has got
a lot of eyes on you.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.677
Hopefully not the Sanfinos'.

24:04.711 --> 24:08.214
You're on a fast track and it
ain't 'cause of your old man.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.083
If anything, it's
in spite of me.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.053
Only way I'd have it.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.755
(sighs)

24:17.256 --> 24:20.226
You know, I painted a few
houses when I walked a beat.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.895
Window trim was
my specialty.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.632
Freehand, no tape.

24:25.665 --> 24:29.035
If you had it to do over...

24:29.068 --> 24:31.137
Aw, that's not a real place;
I'm not going there.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.005
Humor me.

24:33.039 --> 24:36.142
Okay, if I had it to
do all over again,

24:36.175 --> 24:37.744
I'd still take the test,

24:37.777 --> 24:40.012
but I'd rob a bank on
my way to get there.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.514
How's that?

24:44.050 --> 24:49.622
Jamie... if you joined the
department after Joe died

24:49.656 --> 24:53.059
as a way of helping us
all heal-- especially me--

24:53.092 --> 24:56.028
if that resonates, you should
know that job is done.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.265
I've made my peace
with it as much as I can.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.738
Dad, I like the life.

25:05.772 --> 25:08.641
And if Joe's death

25:08.675 --> 25:10.943
brought me to it,
then so be it.

25:10.977 --> 25:14.213
I never thought I was
gonna get rich being a cop.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.115
Even a Harvard graduate
could figure that out.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.055
Any more chips?

25:23.089 --> 25:26.092
There's another bag
in the cupboard.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.730
Connie is not a gun runner.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.931
Come on, Mike.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.233
What does that look like
to you over there?

25:34.266 --> 25:36.235
It doesn't make any sense.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.904
Maybe somebody's setting him up.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.038
Setting him up?

25:39.071 --> 25:41.340
You know, all my years on the
job, that's the first time

25:41.373 --> 25:43.876
I ever heard a line so stupid
coming from behind a badge.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.144
Doesn't mean it's not true.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.713
All right, well, either way,

25:46.746 --> 25:48.214
Connie has a lot
of explaining to do.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.817
I know.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.118
What's with the cuffs?

25:52.151 --> 25:54.621
Detective Montero,
firearms investigation, meet

25:54.654 --> 25:56.022
Auxiliary Officer,
Mike Galatis.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.657
He killed some creep
named Billy Jackson

25:57.690 --> 25:59.091
in his uncle's diner.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.027
Oh, yeah? Well, you did
the world a favor.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.128
You ever meet his buddy,

26:02.161 --> 26:03.162
Joey Sava?
Yeah,

26:03.195 --> 26:04.163
that's him!

26:04.196 --> 26:05.197
That's the other guy.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.365
All right, settle down.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.267
What do you got
on this guy, Sava?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.669
I have truck hijacking
in Virginia.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.103
He killed the driver

26:11.137 --> 26:12.872
and made off with more
than just these weapons.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.273
There're 211 still out there.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.809
So, uh, your uncle was
in business with these guys?

26:16.843 --> 26:17.977
No.
No, Mike

26:18.010 --> 26:20.813
seems to think there's some
other explanation, don't you?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.281
You want to find Connie?

26:23.382 --> 26:24.651
Me, too.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.820
Mike, where would you look?

26:27.854 --> 26:31.257
He had this thing
with a waitress.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.259
Maureen something.

26:33.292 --> 26:36.028
I dropped him off
at her place once.
Great.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.864
Do you remember where that is?

26:37.897 --> 26:40.366
It's around 14th Street.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.802
I could probably
find it again.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.237
Okay, let's take
another ride.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.310
Hey.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.244
Kevin.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.245
Oh...

26:53.279 --> 26:55.381
Not trying to
avoid me, are you?

26:55.414 --> 26:57.283
Not at all.
Come on.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.284
He never gave me a chance.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.920
He had his mind made up
before he even sat down.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.288
Not true.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.290
There's no fault here,
only difference of opinion.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.259
Garrett, I am open to direction,
but I cannot work in a vacuum.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.795
You won't be, Kevin;
I know him.

27:08.828 --> 27:09.962
He'll come back to
you with direction,

27:09.996 --> 27:12.264
but not until he's certain
of where he's pointing you.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.266
And then what? It's
his way or the highway?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.335
Only when he's
convinced he's right.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.503
Which is how often?

27:17.536 --> 27:20.673
When I quit tracking that, I
could finally quit smoking.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.274
Have a good night.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.343
Listen, Garrett, we're
doing this campaign

27:24.376 --> 27:26.813
with the commissioner's
input or without.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.848
If he wants to be heard,
he should start talking.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.017
I'll be in touch.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.227
DANNY:
Kid, I'm starting
to think you got us

27:41.260 --> 27:42.461
on a wild-goose chase here.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.263
What are we doing?
I think we're close.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.298
You "think we're close,"
you said that

27:46.332 --> 27:48.134
ten blocks ago.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.436
See that check-cashing place?

27:50.469 --> 27:52.104
Yeah.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.006
A few years back,
some guys held it up,

27:54.040 --> 27:56.242
killed a couple customers
for no reason.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.145
When they came out, they ran
right into two Auxiliary.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.346
I remember that,
the perps

28:00.379 --> 28:02.214
thought the, uh,
they were real cops.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.315
Shot them both.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.451
They never had a chance.
Yeah.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.119
You know those guys
or something?

28:07.153 --> 28:09.956
No. I wasn't on back then,

28:09.989 --> 28:12.892
but I almost got assigned
to this precinct.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.227
(phone beeps)
Just gets you thinking,
you know?

28:15.261 --> 28:17.296
We just got a text;
Connie just used his credit card

28:17.329 --> 28:18.798
at a liquor store
a couple blocks away.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.366
Great.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.334
Let's go get him.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.072
Constantine Markos, police.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.374
Get your hands up front,
sir, where I can see them.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.842
Is there a problem?

28:29.876 --> 28:31.878
You could say
that. Come on.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.147
You know, someone in there
has been worried about you.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.415
Michael!

28:36.448 --> 28:37.817
Don't worry, Connie,
everything's gonna be fine.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.151
These are good detectives.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.787
You keep your mouth
shut, understand?
Come on.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.089
No. Listen, we need
to clear this up.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.390
Tell them what happened.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.458
Connie, they found
all these guns.
Hey, hey...

28:46.492 --> 28:48.360
They're looking
at me for murder.
Get inside!

28:48.394 --> 28:49.862
Let's go.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.130
I want a lawyer.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.331
You'll get a lawyer.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.366
Follow us back to the squad.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.946
JACKIE:
You know this guy?

29:09.548 --> 29:10.716
No.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.854
We've got a witness that says
he's seen you two talking.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.255
Was that a question,
Detective?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.090
Signome. It's fine.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.961
If you mean Michael,
he's obviously confused.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.429
Do you have a crime

29:23.462 --> 29:24.997
you'd like
to talk about, Detective?

29:25.031 --> 29:27.133
How about 25 illegal firearms

29:27.166 --> 29:29.135
I found in your client's
storage locker?

29:29.168 --> 29:32.138
My client is not the only one
with access to that locker,

29:32.171 --> 29:33.940
as you well know.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.541
Those guns are not his.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.576
So, Connie, are you
saying they're Michael's?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.378
I'm not saying anything.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.013
Well, I think you should
be saying something.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.915
See, we found a dead
guy in your diner,

29:42.949 --> 29:44.350
and you happened to run away.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.819
It wasn't me who made him dead.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.355
I ran because I was scared
his friends would come for me.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.957
Who? What friends?

29:50.990 --> 29:52.358
I don't know;
they all have friends.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.292
Joey Sava?

29:53.325 --> 29:56.262
Connie, listen, if you
tell us where he is,

29:56.295 --> 29:59.065
it's gonna be a lot easier
on you and on Michael.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.366
My client is under
no obligation

30:00.399 --> 30:02.268
to help you, detective.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.203
And as far as his nephew...

30:04.236 --> 30:06.138
The boy made his own bed.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.874
What the hell is he doing?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.141
What does it look
like he's doing?

30:09.175 --> 30:10.342
He's saving his own ass.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.011
By pinning this on me?

30:12.044 --> 30:13.545
Yeah, well, that's
how it works, kid.

30:13.579 --> 30:16.115
Oh, son of a bitch.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.317
This... This isn't happening.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.119
I was trying to help him.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.620
And now he's helping himself.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.589
So you got a choice.

30:23.622 --> 30:26.092
You can do the right thing
and you can help us now.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.460
He practically raised me.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.297
(sniffles)

30:31.330 --> 30:33.099
(sighs)

30:33.132 --> 30:35.001
Come on, let's go for a walk.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.004
Come on.

30:38.037 --> 30:41.007
I know how bad you
wanted to be a cop.

30:41.040 --> 30:45.044
And I'm sorry that it
didn't work out for you.

30:45.077 --> 30:49.081
But you got a
second chance here.

30:49.115 --> 30:52.584
You can stop feeling
sorry for yourself,

30:52.618 --> 30:56.088
and you could think about what
it is you can do to help us.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.423
Think about all the things

30:57.456 --> 30:59.025
you've seen
your Uncle Connie do,

30:59.058 --> 31:02.161
and all the times you gave him
the benefit of the doubt.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.096
You can put yourself
behind a gold shield,

31:04.130 --> 31:06.398
and you can think about it
the way a cop would.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.303
We got to get Joey Sava
off the streets,

31:11.337 --> 31:15.074
and you giving us Connie is
the only way we can do it.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.879
Nobody said
the job was easy.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.988
What is this?

31:29.021 --> 31:31.090
Connie's last chance.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.960
Connie, you give us Joe Sava,
the D.A. will go easy on you.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.461
As I was telling
your partner,

31:35.494 --> 31:37.263
you have nothing
on my client.

31:37.296 --> 31:40.199
Actually, we do.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.235
Bring him in.

31:49.541 --> 31:53.312
Michael,
this isn't a game.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.580
Not another word.

31:54.613 --> 31:58.117
Think about what you're doing.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.518
What am I doing, Connie?

31:59.551 --> 32:01.187
You're trying to bury me.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.255
I'm telling the truth.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.225
That box with the guns in it
was in the diner one morning,

32:06.258 --> 32:08.227
nailed shut.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.696
Connie told me to stick
it in storage, so I did.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.231
Which proves nothing.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.201
It's just your
word against his.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.368
(sighs)

32:16.402 --> 32:19.338
It's not just mine.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.073
Remember, Connie?

32:21.107 --> 32:22.574
That box weighed a ton.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.143
Ralph, your chicken guy,

32:24.176 --> 32:26.178
had to help me
put it in the car.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.346
He asked you
what was in it,

32:27.379 --> 32:30.082
you told him it was
cast iron skillets.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.584
That's corroboration.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.620
That puts the weapons
in his sole possession.

32:38.424 --> 32:42.061
What did I ever do to you
except take care of you, huh?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.095
I treated you like a son.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.097
Connie.
What were you thinking?

32:45.131 --> 32:49.135
If I wanted help from a real
cop, I would have called one.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.409
I'm sorry, Connie.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.511
I won't bother you again.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.319
Now, unless you want to spend

33:07.353 --> 33:09.155
the rest of your life
in Sing Sing

33:09.188 --> 33:11.157
slinging eggs,

33:11.190 --> 33:13.192
you're going
to give us Joey Sava.

33:18.297 --> 33:22.201
(short siren blast)

33:22.234 --> 33:24.203
ESU CAPTAIN:
Reagan.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.472
You must be that bad feeling
I woke up with this morning.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.540
It's funny, Cap, you
know, I get that a lot.

33:28.574 --> 33:29.541
All right,
listen up,

33:29.575 --> 33:31.210
we're looking for one Joe Sava.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.478
He did ten years
for manslaughter.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.581
He's got outstanding warrants
for felony assault and menacing.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.816
This guy is no joke,
so let's keep it tight.
I need two of you

33:37.849 --> 33:39.218
around back,
two of you around front.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.786
Whose vehicle is this?
My car.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.721
All right, you, anything goes
down, that's the hospital car.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.722
You got it?
Yes.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.191
Good.
No knock?

33:45.224 --> 33:46.592
No knock,
third floor.
All right.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.327
Let's hit it.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.421
*

34:25.564 --> 34:26.465
Police!
Get down!

34:26.498 --> 34:27.466
Down on the ground!

34:27.499 --> 34:29.101
Down on the ground now!

34:29.135 --> 34:31.237
Hands behind your head!
Don't move, don't move!

34:32.604 --> 34:33.605
Joey!

34:39.245 --> 34:40.612
Hey!

34:40.646 --> 34:41.847
Reagan!

34:41.880 --> 34:43.182
Joey!

34:43.215 --> 34:44.316
Joey Sava!

34:44.350 --> 34:45.784
Hey!

34:47.653 --> 34:49.255
Hold it!

34:49.288 --> 34:50.456
Hey!

34:54.260 --> 34:55.861
Joey Sava!

34:55.894 --> 34:57.396
Police!
Don't move!

34:57.796 --> 34:59.231
(gunshots)

35:10.509 --> 35:11.510
(gunshots)

35:13.712 --> 35:14.713
Hold it!

35:20.852 --> 35:23.589
(grunts)

35:23.622 --> 35:25.757
Joey!

35:25.791 --> 35:26.558
(gunshot)

35:31.363 --> 35:33.332
(gun clicking)

35:40.639 --> 35:42.608
Drop it!

35:42.641 --> 35:43.842
Drop it and put your hands

35:43.875 --> 35:46.445
where I can see
'em right now!

35:46.478 --> 35:49.181
Get on your knees.
Don't even think about it.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.716
On your knees!

35:50.749 --> 35:52.584
What are you gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

35:53.619 --> 35:54.586
(Sava groans)

35:54.620 --> 35:56.388
That's what I'm gonna do.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.692
Jackass.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.169
(sighs)

36:13.372 --> 36:16.942
Hey, that's a nice look
for you, kid, no handcuffs.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.311
Yeah, grand jury
cleared me.

36:19.345 --> 36:20.446
Figured they would.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.947
Not without
your testimony.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.382
Hey, I told them
what happened.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.217
Don't get all sentimental
about it, all right?

36:25.251 --> 36:27.219
Yeah, a different detective
could have gone either way.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.488
You got lucky this time; maybe
you'll get lucky next time.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.622
When you taking
the cop test again?

36:30.656 --> 36:32.224
(chuckles)
You knew I would, huh?

36:32.258 --> 36:34.293
Yeah-- well,
I'll tell you what--

36:34.326 --> 36:36.695
find out who your investigator
is, give me a call.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.365
I got a few connections
in the department.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.566
(car door shuts)

36:52.378 --> 36:54.413
Guy's bedroom was like a shrine
to the NYPD,

36:54.446 --> 36:56.248
except he had a picture of you
where you're supposed to have

36:56.282 --> 36:57.849
a poster of the rock star
or the quarterback.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.685
Or SpongeBob.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.786
Granddad SquarePants.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.621
(laughter)
NICKY:
Come on, boys,

37:02.654 --> 37:04.523
let's go make that on Photoshop.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.560
Sounds like this guy
was really obsessed.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.929
If you want something bad
enough and you can't have it,

37:10.962 --> 37:12.898
then you try your damnedest
to get near it.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.533
DANNY:
Well, I'm not going
to judge the guy.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.702
Who knows where I'd be
if I failed the test?

37:16.735 --> 37:19.371
You'd be laying bricks and
drinking too much beer.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.441
DANNY: Those weren't my
only two choices in life,

37:22.474 --> 37:23.609
you know.
No, you're right,

37:23.642 --> 37:25.811
there was
installing car stereos,

37:25.844 --> 37:28.680
along with selling aluminum
siding in New Jersey,

37:28.714 --> 37:30.349
along with drinking
too much beer.

37:30.382 --> 37:30.816
(laughter)

37:30.849 --> 37:32.484
DANNY:
All right.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.485
You think that's funny?

37:33.519 --> 37:34.686
What about you guys?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.755
Ladies' better shoes.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.725
Staying in the Marines.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.726
And you?

37:40.759 --> 37:43.028
Oh, we already know
about you.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.796
I'd be helping
bad guys go free,

37:44.830 --> 37:47.966
driving a Beemer, and
dreading every morning.
Hmm.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.435
Or you could've
been an ADA.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.570
I love waking up for
work every morning.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.773
All due respect, sis,
but cops are cooler.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.475
Hear, hear.
With all due respect,

37:56.508 --> 38:00.446
career choices based on a cool
factor is for 15-year-olds.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.513
Thank you.
FRANK:
Oh.

38:01.547 --> 38:02.481
Yeah, is that why you took

38:02.514 --> 38:04.950
a job as a cocktail
waitress at the Roxy--

38:04.983 --> 38:07.519
because that job commanded
such respect?
(laughs)

38:07.553 --> 38:10.922
HENRY:
I thought you used to work
at a roller-skating rink.

38:10.956 --> 38:11.923
It was a roller-
skating rink.

38:11.957 --> 38:12.758
LINDA:
Yeah, in the '70s

38:12.791 --> 38:15.461
when you were in,
like, grade school.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.529
I did have
roller skates on.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.031
(others laughing)

38:20.065 --> 38:23.469
No way you didn't know
Erin was a cocktail waitress.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.504
Why would you think that?

38:25.537 --> 38:26.605
You're my dad.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.939
(chuckles)

38:27.973 --> 38:29.941
I knew.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.679
Sometimes one chooses
to let things slide.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.351
And I didn't become a cop
because of Joe

38:39.385 --> 38:41.387
or for the money obviously.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.856
Why did you?

38:44.890 --> 38:48.026
Growing up, it always seemed
that what you guys made

38:48.059 --> 38:50.662
was never the reason
you did what you did.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.464
It was the work itself,

38:52.498 --> 38:54.099
the stories you got
into the middle of,

38:54.132 --> 38:58.937
the adventures, the comedies,
the tragedies.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.939
FRANK:
The adventures,

39:00.972 --> 39:03.975
the comedies, the tragedies.

39:04.009 --> 39:07.579
Going to work every day with the
feeling anything could happen,

39:07.613 --> 39:13.051
and you'd be in the middle
of it, making a difference.

39:13.084 --> 39:17.122
And being part of a brotherhood
that spans almost 300 years.

39:17.155 --> 39:20.592
I know that's not the Big Idea,

39:20.626 --> 39:22.060
and I don't pretend
to have it,

39:22.093 --> 39:25.631
but it seems to me...

39:25.664 --> 39:27.499
that the personal stories
should be

39:27.533 --> 39:29.535
the heart and soul of it.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.505
Anything there
you can work with?

39:33.539 --> 39:35.040
(exhales)

39:35.073 --> 39:37.042
I don't suppose I could
just turn the camera

39:37.075 --> 39:38.076
on the commissioner?

39:38.109 --> 39:39.411
Not a chance.
